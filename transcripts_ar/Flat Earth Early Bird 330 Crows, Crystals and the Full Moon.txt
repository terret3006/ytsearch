38.17 --> 45.230000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.14 --> 46.58
early-bird number 330 I'm your host

66.17 --> 72.83
can find the links in the description

67.22 --> 76.61
box below so welcome everyone it's it's

72.83 --> 86.50999999999999
not a warm day but it's not a wet day

76.61 --> 88.19
too much and cloudy I tried to get some

86.51 --> 91.07000000000001
moon footage yesterday

88.19 --> 95.39
but had some problems with the settings

91.07 --> 97.69999999999999
and it was all dark so I think I may

95.39 --> 103.549
have screwed up a first clip that was

97.7 --> 104.09
actually kind of good and then I tried

103.549 --> 106.31
again

104.09 --> 108.259
I haven't even uploaded it yet it was

106.31 --> 111.71000000000001
really late I felt really tired after

108.259 --> 115.57900000000001
that and a meeting we even called a bit

111.71 --> 119.829
about work yeah like getting the new OBS

115.579 --> 125.85
format in place which is really tired

119.829 --> 132.15
mostly tired yesterday so

125.85 --> 140.98
today I have with me tumeric coffee tea

132.15 --> 146.459
and my breakfast still an Illuminati

140.98 --> 150.069
cough ah yeah looking forward to that

146.459 --> 155.53
also there's some interesting new

150.069 --> 160.29999999999998
developments going on biology wise with

155.53 --> 164.47
what's going on on the roof I've taken

160.3 --> 170.38000000000002
notice of a certain unusual type of bird

164.47 --> 175.6
and it's been acting quite uniquely

170.38 --> 179.35
among the others and it's a special

175.6 --> 182.65
creature I I think what happened is that

179.35 --> 185.47
at some point during the summer when all

182.65 --> 187.81
the birds got frenzied out and like all

185.47 --> 194.25
euphoric about the summer or whatever I

187.81 --> 198.37
think that probably let's see a crow

194.25 --> 200.95
raped a magpie or the other way around

198.37 --> 203.709
because the Magpies can get like totally

200.95 --> 205.32899999999998
megalomaniacal and I don't know but

203.709 --> 207.489
something happened because I think

205.329 --> 210.4
there's like a crossover of a crow and a

207.489 --> 213.4
Mac by now hopping around and it's very

210.4 --> 215.769
unusual in its behavior it seems a

213.4 --> 218.5
complete standalone creature it's not

215.769 --> 221.53
behaving socially at all it's very

218.5 --> 228.299
dominant and it's not afraid of anything

221.53 --> 231.79
including me in the last few days I've

228.299 --> 236.34
I've almost got it to literally step on

231.79 --> 238.84
my hand it's incredible and it's

236.34 --> 240.70000000000002
tracking me it's like trying to

238.84 --> 244.15
communicate with me and tracking what I

240.7 --> 246.60899999999998
do and it's basically figured out that

244.15 --> 248.53
yeah I sometimes do bring bread or other

246.609 --> 250.63
thingies on the roof and it made that

248.53 --> 253.51
connection and it's trying to figure out

250.63 --> 255.56
how it can get me to give it more

253.51 --> 258.75
[Laughter]

255.56 --> 261.06
but it's not aggressive at all it's only

258.75 --> 263.09
aggressive to competition of its food

261.06 --> 265.59
and that can be anyone other crows

263.09 --> 267.78
usually not so much I think it does

265.59 --> 270.39
identify a bit like a crow but the other

267.78 --> 273.69
crows kind of don't respect it as much

270.39 --> 277.32
because it has it has pretty much decide

273.69 --> 282.18
it's the size of the crew it has the

277.32 --> 285.39
head of a crow but it has white wings

282.18 --> 287.76
like at half of its wings are white at

285.39 --> 290.61
the end almost like a magpie but that's

287.76 --> 299.13
just it only the wings it's a very

290.61 --> 304.47
strange sight also one of the yeah I

299.13 --> 307.8
guess I I can feel its distress too

304.47 --> 312.63000000000005
socially like it doesn't seem to be very

307.8 --> 315.83
happy about its its social isolation

312.63 --> 318.69
with the other birds but it's like

315.83 --> 322.58
responding typically as birds or as

318.69 --> 325.41
animals anything will do that is just

322.58 --> 329.81
throwing everything it's got just

325.41 --> 332.97
dominate as much as possible to survive

329.81 --> 335.91
but it's an interesting creature and

332.97 --> 338.61
also considering the type of social and

335.91 --> 341.1
all-around intelligence and conscious

338.61 --> 343.71000000000004
that the two different birds have a

341.1 --> 346.70000000000005
cross over could do all kinds of weird

343.71 --> 349.46999999999997
interesting results psychologically and

346.7 --> 353.65999999999997
that's what makes it look so so

349.47 --> 353.66
absolutely unique in its behavior

354.199 --> 358.939
because it's almost like it has the

356.84 --> 361.21
intelligence of a crow then they are

358.939 --> 365.86
incredibly intelligent crows like

361.21 --> 369.77
unbelievably but yeah they're very

365.86 --> 375.68
secretive and and shy and like very

369.77 --> 380.389
defensive and aware but Magpies are much

375.68 --> 385.159
more flamboyant in their character so I

380.389 --> 387.949
think that it's become like an eccentric

385.159 --> 390.43899999999996
crow in its personality with that

387.949 --> 393.77000000000004
intelligence but because of the

390.439 --> 396.889
isolation just has more it's basically

393.77 --> 401.389
being forced to start using its

396.889 --> 408.05
intelligence just to distract itself so

401.389 --> 409.389
a fascinating situation bird no no

408.05 --> 412.729
definitely not

409.389 --> 414.05
no I think it is a natural aberration I

412.729 --> 417.56
think this kind of thing probably

414.05 --> 422.12
happens very occasionally and it's a

417.56 --> 425.719
crush across species a bit like a what

422.12 --> 430.189
is it the mule is a crossover between a

425.719 --> 431.839
horse and a donkey I think this is the

430.189 --> 435.8
same type of thing because Magpies and

431.839 --> 439.789
crows are pretty much in the same bird

435.8 --> 443.96000000000004
family category so I think it could be

439.789 --> 448.899
possible or otherwise it's just gonna be

443.96 --> 452.81
a weird Crow mutation ligers and tycoons

448.899 --> 455.509
right so that yeah it's very weird to

452.81 --> 461.93
have a creature right here

455.509 --> 464.27000000000004
that's like hanging along and even being

461.93 --> 466.49
attention grabby to me sometimes get a

464.27 --> 468.02
bit gets a bit annoying because even

466.49 --> 469.849
when I just take smoke breaks or

468.02 --> 472.729
whatever on the roof it's really just

469.849 --> 475.509
like trying to get close to me hang

472.729 --> 475.50899999999996
around and

475.76 --> 486.15
it's a bit weird dozen behave like the

479.34 --> 489.78
other birds at all but I do wonder like

486.15 --> 495.96
in my mind at least like this is an

489.78 --> 503.09999999999997
interesting thing could I bend our

495.96 --> 509.52
relationship into like a semi semi semi

503.1 --> 512.13
pet a wild Pat situation where yeah I

509.52 --> 514.41
could basically take this crow wherever

512.13 --> 517.16
I go type of setup eventually I don't

514.41 --> 519.7199999999999
know that maybe this is just my fantasy

517.16 --> 526.26
you know it does remain still a certain

519.72 --> 529.5600000000001
bird type that's very wanting their own

526.26 --> 531.39
way like both Magpies and crows so it

529.56 --> 536.67
might not really work out it might just

531.39 --> 539.43
be too eccentric and - going by its own

536.67 --> 545.7199999999999
will but it's still interesting that

539.43 --> 548.8589999999999
it's going on all right

545.72 --> 548.859
[Music]

553.68 --> 559.14
if I can pick it up on camera also I've

556.95 --> 561.87
been thinking of basically setting up my

559.14 --> 565.0699999999999
tripod but my p900 filming the roof and

561.87 --> 568.17
then going on at see if I can actually

565.07 --> 570.1500000000001
show how it is interacting with me

568.17 --> 575.43
because it is really interesting though

570.15 --> 582.36
I think from my nature studies

575.43 --> 585.66
perspective yeah I did also was it did

582.36 --> 589.38
get my diploma with biology including

585.66 --> 597.02
and that's not that is because I am

589.38 --> 597.02
interested in biology plants animals and

597.77 --> 607.01
their intricate behavior and how it all

603.18 --> 609.66
really works out together anyway

607.01 --> 611.46
yeah full moon last night that's right

609.66 --> 613.86
yeah I totally forgot to go through a

611.46 --> 620.1600000000001
chat by the way sorry it just to

613.86 --> 622.35
distract but yeah there it is it's right

620.16 --> 629.87
there hold on before I go through Chet

622.35 --> 629.87
just let me show you let's see

630.42 --> 633.26
there it is

644.35 --> 648.4
sometimes I think it has a little bit

646.81 --> 651.04
trouble with its throat or something

648.4 --> 655.81
because it does crow in a very peculiar

651.04 --> 657.49
way and almost like if something is

655.81 --> 658.9599999999999
stuck in its throat and it does this

657.49 --> 662.47
regularly so it might

658.96 --> 664.69
during the cross cross over have

662.47 --> 666.39
contracted certain physical ailments

664.69 --> 669.0100000000001
because of the added design

666.39 --> 671.5
incompatibility in some regions this

669.01 --> 675.25
could be and this is also one of the

671.5 --> 679.09
things that despite that is fascinating

675.25 --> 683.44
it also kind of worries me and makes me

679.09 --> 685.21
sad for it because in with it's all its

683.44 --> 690.1300000000001
intelligent it probably does realize

685.21 --> 692.73
that it is like a mutation it can't be

690.13 --> 695.02
good for the foreign ego of any creature

692.73 --> 702.87
but do you see the white wings at the

695.02 --> 702.87
end so it's now just grabbing for crumbs

710.39 --> 715.52
[Music]

716.56 --> 724.7689999999999
yeah it has the flu well maybe yeah you

721.269 --> 727.019
see the flu is also psychosomatic and

724.769 --> 730.389
creatures can get that as well

727.019 --> 733.269
definitely especially creatures that are

730.389 --> 735.999
susceptible to social hierarchy and

733.269 --> 738.399
interaction they are all susceptible to

735.999 --> 740.35
the flu because that will often cause

738.399 --> 744.87
typical type types of stresses that

740.35 --> 744.87
results in a psychosomatic flu response

745.139 --> 753.66
so anyway yeah that's it I'm actually

749.589 --> 753.6600000000001
thinking of trying to give it a name I

755.519 --> 760.05
was thinking of calling it George

760.86 --> 772.589
but maybe maybe that's actually kind of

765.73 --> 772.589
mean so I don't know yet

774.17 --> 781.9499999999999
[Music]

777.23 --> 787.47
no not like that at all just having a

781.95 --> 790.08
cold it's not a disease no I'm not gonna

787.47 --> 795.0
throw some meat for it first place

790.08 --> 799.98
because I don't have any the but yeah

795.0 --> 805.01
the best I could do is like throw boiled

799.98 --> 805.01
egg pieces for it or something maybe but

806.99 --> 813.96
what I do mostly is give the remnants of

811.32 --> 816.24
the bread that I use and there's usually

813.96 --> 818.9100000000001
a lot of seeds that were on top of the

816.24 --> 822.03
bread along with it and that's some good

818.91 --> 827.1
stuff and now that it's getting cold I

822.03 --> 829.86
sometimes add like coconut oil and I

827.1 --> 833.61
just yeah put some on it to fatten it up

829.86 --> 836.16
from you know and that way they get

833.61 --> 839.84
plenty of food and besides there's bugs

836.16 --> 839.8399999999999
crawling all over the place

845.28 --> 849.8299999999999
it's like in the water bowl

856.93 --> 859.529
yeah

863.99 --> 866.95
so yeah

867.39 --> 870.539
[Music]

871.46 --> 879.8000000000001
interesting isn't it just got a weird

875.43 --> 887.52
oddity Oh I dug out a lot of crystals a

879.8 --> 890.16
lot of minerals and this morning so I

887.52 --> 893.06
got quite the view so it's amazing to

890.16 --> 898.13
bump back into rocks you forgot you have

893.06 --> 898.13
and that are just amazing I always had a

898.79 --> 905.31
like a craving for special type of rocks

902.76 --> 908.31
that are just uniform and have a unique

905.31 --> 912.5999999999999
pattern to them like for example this

908.31 --> 915.4799999999999
thing I personally completely uncovered

912.6 --> 918.63
this thing of chalk because it was

915.48 --> 925.89
filled up with chalk before this look at

918.63 --> 927.4
that let's see if I can add a little

925.89 --> 930.6
light to that

927.4 --> 930.6
[Music]

938.559 --> 941.639
isn't that amazing

942.76 --> 947.519
especially just this side

950.55 --> 973.279
it's a giant meteor coming for love it I

974.0 --> 981.72
love these things because they always

976.29 --> 984.51
reminded me of how meteors how I thought

981.72 --> 989.73
meteors were and inside there's like

984.51 --> 991.98
pyrite it's pretty beautiful but I never

989.73 --> 998.0600000000001
break them up like I know what's inside

991.98 --> 998.0600000000001
it's like huge ways to break them open

1002.02 --> 1010.6999999999999
look I found my moon rock yeah I'm

1007.04 --> 1012.13
serious look I found the moon rock guys

1010.7 --> 1015.13
I found it

1012.13 --> 1015.13
see

1019.11 --> 1022.13
pretty cool huh

1027.859 --> 1031.069
[Music]

1038.85 --> 1056.3799999999999
yep I still remember that discovery that

1053.62 --> 1059.59
the moon rock was petrified wood even I

1056.38 --> 1064.1200000000001
think in the 90s when I was a vivid glow

1059.59 --> 1068.8
believer with scary hints that there was

1064.12 --> 1072.4599999999998
something wrong with the universe as it

1068.8 --> 1075.01
were and I was just insulted like how

1072.46 --> 1079.8600000000001
dare those NASA people just fool around

1075.01 --> 1082.45
with this why would they do that to us

1079.86 --> 1084.55
that was my response to the first

1082.45 --> 1088.1100000000001
hearing that the moon rock actually

1084.55 --> 1088.11
turned out to be petrified wood

1094.48 --> 1101.07
oh wow

1102.21 --> 1105.54
hello there

1107.38 --> 1113.5200000000002
this one is not camera-shy you hear him

1142.74 --> 1149.64
anyway I'm gonna keep close track of the

1145.62 --> 1151.289
off of its health just how it looks yeah

1149.64 --> 1153.7990000000002
of course he wants feeding I already

1151.289 --> 1159.179
gave him feeding like three times today

1153.799 --> 1161.37
that creature is like a total well you

1159.179 --> 1163.8500000000001
know what the weird thing is it could be

1161.37 --> 1166.529
that it could be a type of mutation

1163.85 --> 1169.35
where if you keep on feeding it then

1166.529 --> 1173.19
it'll actually keep on growing you know

1169.35 --> 1176.61
so I have to be careful with my

1173.19 --> 1179.309
eagerness to feed its hunger because

1176.61 --> 1183.539
yeah that might just make things worse

1179.309 --> 1189.799
and also if that would happen that birds

1183.539 --> 1189.799
a dick right

1195.74 --> 1202.549
well yeah all crows are dicks so if it's

1199.52 --> 1205.49
half a crow then it's if it's even half

1202.549 --> 1212.5
a crow worth of being a dick then still

1205.49 --> 1216.26
going to be pretty much a dick no but

1212.5 --> 1220.309
look like even with ligers it's known

1216.26 --> 1222.4089999999999
they keep on growing and they're always

1220.309 --> 1223.73
hungry and if you feed into the hunger

1222.409 --> 1232.6100000000001
more and more they're going to grow

1223.73 --> 1239.98
faster so yeah I'm just trying to be

1232.61 --> 1239.9799999999998
real about it oh yeah and they love

1251.55 --> 1259.6399999999999
mmm just I don't know sometimes its

1256.41 --> 1259.64
behavior worries me

1277.37 --> 1287.25
no no not our wins Dungeons & Dragons

1282.15 --> 1289.91
friend please don't I'm still your best

1287.25 --> 1289.91
friend buddy

1291.89 --> 1298.289
[Music]

1315.72 --> 1321.48
look at that fully

1322.13 --> 1340.2
materialised without any brakes doing

1328.86 --> 1344.8999999999999
rows pretty amazing huh and here's one

1340.2 --> 1344.9
that was unfortunately of a bigger part

1346.22 --> 1353.9
was probably much bigger and they broke

1348.78 --> 1353.8999999999999
it up right here too bad

1360.74 --> 1365.0
try those spaghetti balls right

1408.73 --> 1419.2
right Michael be well look the whole

1413.83 --> 1423.8999999999999
issue is that my case about light not

1419.2 --> 1426.8500000000001
being an indivisible unit of energy is

1423.9 --> 1432.22
to the wider points that are being

1426.85 --> 1436.54
fought kind of superfluous and that's

1432.22 --> 1440.8
why I think that their overall just not

1436.54 --> 1444.01
addressing it and just focusing on on

1440.8 --> 1450.1
their issues of the misunderstandings

1444.01 --> 1453.78
that go that precede it that most people

1450.1 --> 1453.78
get hung up over

1460.02 --> 1463.1
it's my show

1465.18 --> 1479.78
noisy bastard a pied Cora Wong really

1482.9 --> 1491.13
okay I'll look that up that's actually

1486.51 --> 1498.35
kind of interesting if but I doubt it

1491.13 --> 1498.3500000000001
though like how would it get here huh

1501.32 --> 1504.32
okay

1509.08 --> 1514.739
to eastern Australia right well

1519.44 --> 1526.97
it doesn't have the yellow eyes it is

1524.39 --> 1531.74
completely black eyes like a like a crow

1526.97 --> 1537.08
and I this picture that I'm seeing it

1531.74 --> 1539.42
has like a tail feathers that are white

1537.08 --> 1542.02
this creature does not it's it's upper

1539.42 --> 1542.02
wings actually

1550.09 --> 1552.9599999999998
Jesus

1557.58 --> 1567.119
like this anyway it it I think it's

1563.429 --> 1570.299
probably the same species but I don't

1567.119 --> 1573.509
think it's that is what it is

1570.299 --> 1576.799
doesn't look like it at all really but

1573.509 --> 1576.799
thanks for the suggestion

1584.389 --> 1589.129
no Brendan cook I'm not on mute

1604.1 --> 1607.1
capacitance

1608.71 --> 1629.2
it's not supposed to be here oh okay

1618.73 --> 1631.41
some other discussion anyway never shuts

1629.2 --> 1631.41
up

1641.69 --> 1667.1000000000001
a loop Cystic hey yes that actually

1662.27 --> 1673.3
looks exactly like it that that looks

1667.1 --> 1673.3
exactly what is that that's incredible

1673.81 --> 1677.11
what is it

1682.28 --> 1689.97
[Music]

1683.49 --> 1694.909
oh okay an American Crew a condition

1689.97 --> 1694.909
caused by reduced pigmentation okay so

1695.51 --> 1702.0
so it is a crow but it's paling up

1699.38 --> 1705.3600000000001
fascinating so it's a condition it's

1702.0 --> 1707.789
like a yeah like a condition that's very

1705.36 --> 1713.4189999999999
visible and so it is more like a

1707.789 --> 1716.07
mutation not a cross species hmm

1713.419 --> 1719.669
thank you thank you your yeah that's a

1716.07 --> 1723.23
good tip I should actually show some

1719.669 --> 1726.1490000000001
pictures just wow

1723.23 --> 1729.2
there's even like albino crows that's

1726.149 --> 1729.1999999999998
incredible right

1735.35 --> 1744.05
let me get the stuff Oh presentation

1738.41 --> 1747.52
mode so this this creature over here

1744.05 --> 1747.52
just looks exactly

1752.109 --> 1765.1899999999998
come on give me a full right see this is

1760.07 --> 1765.1899999999998
exactly like how it looks exactly I

1770.649 --> 1779.809
think it left because it knew why I was

1775.82 --> 1783.049
annoyed by the sound it was making all

1779.809 --> 1793.539
right but anyway yeah that's exactly

1783.049 --> 1798.529
like what it looks like hmm so yeah

1793.539 --> 1802.69
interesting but still the behavior is

1798.529 --> 1806.299
really odd to me and then I understand

1802.69 --> 1810.489
why it's being so incredibly forthcoming

1806.299 --> 1810.489
towards me and the other crows are not

1813.86 --> 1816.9199999999998
[Music]

1837.3 --> 1847.26
that is horrible I'm not gonna call The

1844.21 --> 1847.26
Crow Russell

1852.14 --> 1856.8700000000001
that's hilarious and terrible at the

1854.36 --> 1856.87
same time

1878.46 --> 1886.23
I have no idea Dave rakuyo effort but

1882.629 --> 1892.32
talking about which I should probably

1886.23 --> 1894.799
try to see if I can show some some of

1892.32 --> 1894.799
that footage

1895.0 --> 1898.349
[Music]

1903.02 --> 1906.28
well when its back

1912.2 --> 1915.2
right

1919.26 --> 1922.46
[Music]

1924.58 --> 1930.8799999999999
let's hope OBS doesn't crash or anything

1927.74 --> 1930.88
[Music]

1947.87 --> 1958.1599999999999
okay let's see what surah okay I got

1950.789 --> 1961.669
both clips I think any 180 anyway yeah

1958.16 --> 1961.669
alright let's see

1967.26 --> 1977.07
that's a very big file and for some okay

1973.35 --> 1981.03
yeah it's like full resolution and the

1977.07 --> 1984.1789999999999
issue is I can't keep it on that

1981.03 --> 1988.7
resolution when I try to put it into a

1984.179 --> 1988.7
file format it's kind of disappointing

1989.09 --> 1997.1599999999999
mmm all right how do I do this

2004.299 --> 2007.679
right have to

2011.77 --> 2014.46
all right

2028.78 --> 2047.639
yeah I have to add it in a separate

2031.95 --> 2053.53
capability see we know capture sorry

2047.639 --> 2058.45
this may take a while before I can get

2053.53 --> 2061.32
this figured out how do i video

2058.45 --> 2061.3199999999997
capturing device

2068.19 --> 2086.87
yes yeah that's how I do it okay now all

2078.09 --> 2086.8700000000003
I need to do let's change the name

2097.93 --> 2107.6499999999996
deed get this inside of here Plus see

2105.82 --> 2111.8300000000004
[Music]

2107.65 --> 2124.87
video capture oh [ __ ]

2111.83 --> 2124.87
that's huge uh okay yeah that's right

2131.17 --> 2138.63
goddammit

2133.72 --> 2138.6299999999997
was it hot yes

2152.48 --> 2155.48
mmm

2162.39 --> 2173.98
okay all right so this is preliminary

2168.63 --> 2176.26
attempt just to get it directly in right

2173.98 --> 2179.97
so this one is so it's under a minute

2176.26 --> 2179.9700000000003
long and loud

2190.22 --> 2195.6189999999997
trying to get this clear shot off the

2192.619 --> 2198.76
moon there's a lot of clouds but also

2195.619 --> 2202.329
clear patches of sky here and there

2198.76 --> 2202.329
about to come up

2228.01 --> 2236.15
bang

2230.329 --> 2237.969
oh yeah yeah then I got cut off so let's

2236.15 --> 2244.309
switch to the next one

2237.969 --> 2247.779
damnit this thing is so oversized that

2244.309 --> 2247.779
should be this one

2258.77 --> 2273.4
this way at least you can still see the

2261.29 --> 2273.4
high resolution of it see that

2275.77 --> 2278.809
[Music]

2317.359 --> 2319.989
McClure

2320.53 --> 2325.2900000000004
yeah and that's pretty much what

2322.24 --> 2325.29
happened after all that

2363.51 --> 2385.4500000000003
I'll wait for it to restart so I can

2366.82 --> 2389.34
keep it on that that opening shop they

2385.45 --> 2389.3399999999997
didn't actually flip back to now

2398.73 --> 2402.5
right that's it

2402.59 --> 2405.67
just look at that

2410.25 --> 2425.24
pretty incredible looking right let's

2421.35 --> 2425.24
just mute myself

2445.12 --> 2448.2
it's a net weird

2448.62 --> 2454.5299999999997
to the top the rest of it just seems

2451.38 --> 2458.13
like a cutoff line but to the top you

2454.53 --> 2466.9500000000003
see the apparent shadow like features

2458.13 --> 2469.82
there how that's so weird

2466.95 --> 2469.8199999999997
just look at it

2475.65 --> 2484.7000000000003
see this this is just like a literally a

2478.68 --> 2490.97
line cut off and here suddenly look

2484.7 --> 2490.97
features that's just so odd

2502.49 --> 2514.7
yeah so anyway yeah it wasn't meant to

2507.349 --> 2517.88
be a fully a separate video but later on

2514.7 --> 2521.75
I will probably use the I'm gonna try to

2517.88 --> 2523.6400000000003
archive these at the high resolution to

2521.75 --> 2526.31
figure out how to do it I might need a

2523.64 --> 2529.1299999999997
special type of interfacing program to

2526.31 --> 2532.0099999999998
extract the video at for high resolution

2529.13 --> 2534.859
I don't know how to do it yet I've heard

2532.01 --> 2536.869
others thought like Randy and Riley

2534.859 --> 2540.41
talking about that like years ago I

2536.869 --> 2546.92
don't remember anything about it but

2540.41 --> 2550.43
I'll get that figured out right so yeah

2546.92 --> 2553.16
that's also something I did for a second

2550.43 --> 2556.5989999999997
when there was just a clear patch of sky

2553.16 --> 2556.5989999999997
for just a moment

2566.03 --> 2578.4100000000003
but isn't it just odd how it looks like

2572.93 --> 2581.54
it's being cut off except for the top

2578.41 --> 2586.52
where there are these apparent shadow

2581.54 --> 2590.84
like features I can't make sense of the

2586.52 --> 2600.74
contrast of it it's very surreal to look

2590.84 --> 2604.31
at it like this see this is non

2600.74 --> 2607.22
manipulated I just put the camera out

2604.31 --> 2609.2
there tried the best I could to aim it

2607.22 --> 2612.3399999999997
properly and keep it as still as I could

2609.2 --> 2612.3399999999997
and this is what I saw

2619.7 --> 2626.68
see even at this distance you still see

2622.819 --> 2626.68
the difference you still see this

2631.36 --> 2636.46
it's I just I don't get it

2636.73 --> 2644.26
it looks very surreal to me not like

2640.25 --> 2644.26
physically literal at all

2649.78 --> 2656.94
oh yeah sure depends on the angle of the

2653.38 --> 2656.94
Sun except it's a full moon

2657.51 --> 2668.7400000000002
yeah so there shouldn't be any it should

2664.48 --> 2682.33
be straight on that's the whole point of

2668.74 --> 2687.04
a full moon yeah it was Bill Thompson it

2682.33 --> 2691.17
was it was registered to be full like

2687.04 --> 2694.38
that at that moment it was for

2691.17 --> 2694.38
definitely was

2702.98 --> 2706.17
[Music]

2717.25 --> 2723.34
it's never that perfect you're right

2721.39 --> 2728.3489999999997
it's never that perfect if you actually

2723.34 --> 2732.13
try to suspend your disbelief about it

2728.349 --> 2735.82
being an object despite all the surreal

2732.13 --> 2739.32
effects that your eyes are subjected to

2735.82 --> 2739.32
when you try to analyze the thing

2765.9 --> 2773.46
all right well I don't like staring into

2769.47 --> 2777.0
some mark colored I did do it when I was

2773.46 --> 2780.77
younger then I think I pretty much

2777.0 --> 2786.03
recovered from everything that that did

2780.77 --> 2791.07
but I just generally don't recommend

2786.03 --> 2794.1600000000003
people to do that it can be very good

2791.07 --> 2799.92
however to stare at the Sun with your

2794.16 --> 2802.0499999999997
eyelids closed because you will that

2799.92 --> 2804.33
will enable a certain level of light to

2802.05 --> 2807.1200000000003
actually reach your pineal gland and

2804.33 --> 2811.95
that does have like a charging positive

2807.12 --> 2814.47
effect but just don't subject the back

2811.95 --> 2817.2999999999997
of your eyes to that direct intensity

2814.47 --> 2820.439
for too long I really don't recommend it

2817.3 --> 2820.4390000000003
[Music]

2834.88 --> 2844.36
oh hey well Jorge Sanford

2840.31 --> 2849.63
I don't wear sunglasses either even when

2844.36 --> 2849.63
it's really sunny I just use my face I

2849.72 --> 2856.3599999999997
can have very good shades right here you

2854.32 --> 2862.54
know I have no problem with any type of

2856.36 --> 2866.5
Sun and I don't like sunglasses they

2862.54 --> 2868.75
make me feel less safe that's weird

2866.5 --> 2871.03
isn't it because for most people they

2868.75 --> 2875.53
kind of their social awareness hide

2871.03 --> 2878.4700000000003
behind it for me it just feels like

2875.53 --> 2882.46
obstruction to my oversight ability and

2878.47 --> 2885.1499999999996
a potential danger I don't like wearing

2882.46 --> 2885.15
them at all

2895.65 --> 2901.71
oh right well George Sanford yeah right

2899.34 --> 2905.6400000000003
right when the sun's very low at the

2901.71 --> 2910.4700000000003
horizon it is also less intense sure

2905.64 --> 2913.98
I've stared at many Sundowns many times

2910.47 --> 2916.4399999999996
that's not an issue I'm we're talking

2913.98 --> 2920.15
about like looking at it when it's

2916.44 --> 2920.15
higher up when it's really strong

2925.78 --> 2928.9390000000003
[Music]

2942.98 --> 2949.609
okay goodbye Brandon cook who I've

2946.43 --> 2955.96
unlocked that special request of

2949.609 --> 2955.96
somebody whatever

2974.05 --> 2981.01
now they've rocky again for the Sun is

2977.11 --> 2985.15
not further away the Sun doesn't have

2981.01 --> 2991.21
any distance it's just at an angular

2985.15 --> 2993.9700000000003
position where the edge of vision where

2991.21 --> 2994.87
it appears to you as a holographic

2993.97 --> 2999.48
phenomena

2994.87 --> 3002.5499999999997
between as far as you can see and

2999.48 --> 3006.09
yourself there's just more atmosphere in

3002.55 --> 3010.0800000000004
between to absorb all that light coming

3006.09 --> 3012.96
from that direction so that less light

3010.08 --> 3017.46
reaches your eye and you can take more

3012.96 --> 3019.05
of it more of the total amount of light

3017.46 --> 3021.96
that is coming from that specific

3019.05 --> 3025.98
direction at that time compared to when

3021.96 --> 3029.61
it's the edge of vision is up when it's

3025.98 --> 3033.3
there then between as far as you can see

3029.61 --> 3037.6800000000003
and your location the total amount of

3033.3 --> 3039.3900000000003
air density is comparable s thus absorbs

3037.68 --> 3043.5
less of the light coming from that

3039.39 --> 3045.8399999999997
direction so more of the total energy

3043.5 --> 3048.5
output will reach your eye and can be

3045.84 --> 3048.5
damaging

3063.88 --> 3069.4500000000003
yeah bill Thompson that's exactly what

3067.18 --> 3069.45
I'm doing

3074.45 --> 3081.77
that's exactly what I'm doing I'm saying

3077.39 --> 3086.54
just that okay and that is I guess one

3081.77 --> 3089.48
of the more or less appealing parts

3086.54 --> 3092.7799999999997
depending from the perspective as you

3089.48 --> 3094.609
present it and that is yes that moon

3092.78 --> 3097.2200000000003
that light coming from that direction

3094.609 --> 3102.38
that you see that everybody gets to see

3097.22 --> 3106.97
is a part of creation specifically to

3102.38 --> 3109.73
screw with you with your senses with

3106.97 --> 3112.6699999999996
your constructive senses in order for

3109.73 --> 3116.45
you to be fooled that it is a rock to

3112.67 --> 3120.6800000000003
make you more susceptible to wizards and

3116.45 --> 3125.6299999999997
mystics to weave their fantasies and for

3120.68 --> 3129.71
you to fall for them that is why it

3125.63 --> 3133.52
looks like a freaking dust ball floating

3129.71 --> 3138.16
around that's right it's one of your

3133.52 --> 3138.16
tests it's one of the tests of creation

3143.95 --> 3155.3199999999997
yeah well you can cite me cuz I'm the

3148.33 --> 3158.5
one saying it our way in 2019 I probably

3155.32 --> 3160.15
said it two years ago as well just in

3158.5 --> 3161.95
between tongue and cheek and nobody

3160.15 --> 3166.98
really responding to it but that's what

3161.95 --> 3170.1699999999996
I'm saying yeah that's what it is

3166.98 --> 3174.0
you can squirm all about it you like you

3170.17 --> 3177.61
can deny the nature of creation and

3174.0 --> 3181.17
think up whatever you like and with that

3177.61 --> 3185.9100000000003
with what you're doing doing then there

3181.17 --> 3191.9500000000003
you do exactly what the moon was

3185.91 --> 3196.0
designed for to fool you into saying no

3191.95 --> 3201.2799999999997
it's too much it's too harsh stepping

3196.0 --> 3204.34
away from logos making you step away

3201.28 --> 3206.8900000000003
because of T the light phenomena because

3204.34 --> 3211.92
your eyes fool you and you believe them

3206.89 --> 3211.92
and then things no longer make sense

3229.73 --> 3235.559
no I didn't thought up what I liked

3233.19 --> 3238.829
because you know why I don't like it I

3235.559 --> 3242.46
think it's actually quite cruel but

3238.829 --> 3247.13
that's part of creation it's all tests

3242.46 --> 3247.13
and the more you see the more it hurts

3251.51 --> 3258.0
also explains a lot of behaviors of

3255.0 --> 3263.01
people in the world and why so many

3258.0 --> 3270.66
people do go crazy and do try to just

3263.01 --> 3275.65
detach it's not the solution but it's I

3270.66 --> 3278.8799999999997
get it I get why people go crazy

3275.65 --> 3278.88
[Music]

3295.93 --> 3298.5299999999997
yeah

3300.79 --> 3305.65
well that's to bail that's too bad bill

3303.4 --> 3309.2200000000003
Thompson because the Creator the

3305.65 --> 3313.9900000000002
designer of all things is absolutely

3309.22 --> 3317.74
known to have incorporated bad things

3313.99 --> 3320.41
bad choice options and illusions to fool

3317.74 --> 3323.74
people as part of the whole design in

3320.41 --> 3331.5099999999998
order to be any kind of challenge to the

3323.74 --> 3336.64
entire point of our existence so you

3331.51 --> 3343.69
don't think that's nice oh well too bad

3336.64 --> 3348.67
it's what it is and whether you're gonna

3343.69 --> 3353.02
designate it to one unified glory person

3348.67 --> 3356.2000000000003
type representation or you're gonna

3353.02 --> 3359.65
ascribe it to a designated evil guy as

3356.2 --> 3362.1099999999997
part of creation doesn't really matter

3359.65 --> 3364.65
now does it it is there it is part of

3362.11 --> 3364.65
the design

3401.96 --> 3409.05
all right there's still another option

3405.78 --> 3411.53
by the way but that seems so bizarre and

3409.05 --> 3415.8900000000003
surreal that I don't think it's really

3411.53 --> 3418.23
true and that is that yeah well maybe

3415.89 --> 3421.2
the freaking moon is some kind of

3418.23 --> 3423.92
ancient device the moon projection and

3421.2 --> 3427.35
maybe a lot of the globe of the heavens

3423.92 --> 3432.66
maybe it was a man-made device from

3427.35 --> 3435.38
Atlantean times so maybe it isn't God

3432.66 --> 3438.39
made I don't know

3435.38 --> 3441.96
Kurt turn out to be like quite

3438.39 --> 3445.5299999999997
astonishing that it's been a artificial

3441.96 --> 3448.77
part of of the world for a long time

3445.53 --> 3452.36
made by man instead of part of the

3448.77 --> 3454.86
actual design of the thing I don't know

3452.36 --> 3458.9700000000003
you never really know until the

3454.86 --> 3461.52
mechanism is more closely examined that

3458.97 --> 3471.93
does create all the globe of the heaven

3461.52 --> 3475.02
lights but until it is reaffirmed that

3471.93 --> 3478.6499999999996
the globe of the heavens projection is

3475.02 --> 3481.29
man-made originally a device that is

3478.65 --> 3485.1600000000003
designed that somehow makes that work

3481.29 --> 3487.35
well then yeah only then can you say

3485.16 --> 3491.58
okay well it's probably not a part of

3487.35 --> 3493.44
creation then because it was man-made

3491.58 --> 3499.7999999999997
it's not natural it's not part of the

3493.44 --> 3502.92
original design but until then yet if

3499.8 --> 3508.28
it's been always there as far as history

3502.92 --> 3512.2200000000003
goes and pictures and all that well then

3508.28 --> 3514.01
why would you assume it's not part of

3512.22 --> 3517.0099999999998
the original design

3514.01 --> 3517.01
see

3548.03 --> 3563.02
it's just anyway I'm gonna run out the

3554.33 --> 3563.02
