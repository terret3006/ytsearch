yeah the weather today is

112.939 --> 116.17999999999999
I don't know

116.399 --> 121.979
almost win still

119.04 --> 125.04
hasn't really been any rain

121.979 --> 128.459
but it is kind of clouded up and a bit

125.04 --> 130.81900000000002
cold feels a bit cold probably moist in

128.459 --> 130.81900000000002
the air

133.14 --> 136.55999999999997
and there's a church Gathering there

134.76 --> 139.7
apparently

136.56 --> 139.7
I don't know why

140.459 --> 147.2
but yeah

143.239 --> 147.20000000000002
not very appealing weather

147.959 --> 153.02
right

150.42 --> 153.01999999999998
oh

153.66 --> 158.48
hello LSG first in chat good to see you

158.7 --> 161.0
this

162.66 --> 167.879
to installing

164.7 --> 171.379
right okay it's back to normal

167.879 --> 171.379
right yeah starting late

172.2 --> 178.67999999999998
because yeah it was weird I did get up

175.62 --> 181.92000000000002
like plenty ahead of time

178.68 --> 184.08
but I felt like sickish it was weird

181.92 --> 187.26
like I felt like really kind of sick

184.08 --> 190.09900000000002
even though I've done nothing out of the

187.26 --> 190.099
ordinary to

190.44 --> 195.06
to make that seem logical to me I mean

192.599 --> 197.39999999999998
didn't drink anything of course

195.06 --> 200.7
I didn't like excessively smoke anything

197.4 --> 203.459
didn't go up to bed to bed too late I

200.7 --> 205.379
don't know why I just felt sickish

203.459 --> 207.3
tried to call my healer but he didn't

205.379 --> 211.01899999999998
pick up

207.3 --> 213.54000000000002
so I just kind of took a shower

211.019 --> 215.519
and cried under it no no it wasn't that

213.54 --> 217.44
bad I didn't feel emotional it's just

215.519 --> 221.28
like a weird sick

217.44 --> 223.14
like my stomach was just like well

221.28 --> 225.239
not feeling great but I feel a little

223.14 --> 226.92
better now

225.239 --> 229.44
still a bit

226.92 --> 231.17999999999998
lingering but I mean I thought at first

229.44 --> 232.799
like I'm probably gonna take a shower

231.18 --> 235.5
and then go back to bed or something but

232.799 --> 238.56
I thought like no

235.5 --> 240.36
sickness pretty much did go away during

238.56 --> 241.62
the shower so I just thought like okay

240.36 --> 243.59900000000002
I'll just

241.62 --> 247.34
do a shorter show

243.599 --> 247.34
hey Nathan Oakley good to see you

250.86 --> 253.4
right

253.56 --> 258.0
so yeah yesterday

255.54 --> 258.84
's show was pretty good I thought my own

258.0 --> 261.359
show

258.84 --> 263.69899999999996
and the flight Earth debates also was

261.359 --> 265.25899999999996
pretty good even though it yeah I did

263.699 --> 267.12
miss a big chunk again because of

265.259 --> 269.04
groceries I don't know why it takes them

267.12 --> 271.759
long

269.04 --> 271.759
ah

272.4 --> 276.84
it's probably because if I actually have

275.16 --> 278.1
to pick groceries and I'm really in a

276.84 --> 279.71999999999997
hurry that's when I typically forget

278.1 --> 281.28000000000003
things so I slow down but because

279.72 --> 283.62
slowing down then I forget about the

281.28 --> 286.25899999999996
time and then it takes longer

283.62 --> 289.32
it's a bit annoying

286.259 --> 292.40000000000003
but anyway today I'm not going out

289.32 --> 292.4
that everything I need

292.44 --> 297.9
covered NDT

295.56 --> 300.5
did we

297.9 --> 300.5
could be

300.72 --> 304.86
yeah right with the the other black guy

303.6 --> 306.72
again

304.86 --> 308.40000000000003
I don't know if it was a new stream or

306.72 --> 311.04
some old stream but yeah they were

308.4 --> 312.78
getting pretty nutty but yeah as you

311.04 --> 314.96000000000004
started reviewing that that's when I

312.78 --> 314.96
left

321.18 --> 326.22
I thought like oh you're just gonna

322.74 --> 328.38
review that and I'll be back

326.22 --> 329.759
like where you're probably still

328.38 --> 333.3
reviewing it

329.759 --> 335.88
so yeah I missed that most of that

333.3 --> 338.78000000000003
but overall was just interest it was a

335.88 --> 338.78
good energy and

339.96 --> 346.25899999999996
I feel still felt a little

343.02 --> 349.32
frustrated though over Monday

346.259 --> 351.6
but yeah me and Brian

349.32 --> 354.979
and Adam

351.6 --> 354.97900000000004
just talked about that

355.08 --> 360.65999999999997
like after everybody had left and all

357.72 --> 362.82000000000005
that and yeah that did help

360.66 --> 364.5
because I don't know man I just have

362.82 --> 367.5
been a little

364.5 --> 369.18
long toad or something and the weird

367.5 --> 371.78
thing is is that I don't really see it

369.18 --> 371.78000000000003
coming either

375.96 --> 379.979
is like I'm this big Matchstick it's

378.18 --> 382.199
just like oh everything is cool and then

379.979 --> 384.56
something rubs me the wrong way and it

382.199 --> 384.56
suddenly

395.759 --> 399.78000000000003
right anyway

397.86 --> 401.40000000000003
that that's not gonna happen today it

399.78 --> 402.84
didn't happen yesterday either of course

401.4 --> 405.12
I mean

402.84 --> 406.73999999999995
my own show yesterday was really good

405.12 --> 410.78000000000003
for me to just

406.74 --> 410.78000000000003
honestly talk about it

411.66 --> 417.66
and and even like

414.78 --> 420.25899999999996
how yeah you just have to watch the show

417.66 --> 420.259
from yesterday

420.68 --> 426.199
very elaborate piece on just like this

423.479 --> 426.199
rage and

428.4 --> 433.919
what it is and what I do with it and try

431.4 --> 436.979
to do get something from it

433.919 --> 438.59999999999997
like if I'm gonna be having that I might

436.979 --> 440.639
as well like try to do something

438.6 --> 441.78000000000003
constructive with it even if it is

440.639 --> 443.46000000000004
surreal

441.78 --> 445.919
doesn't matter

443.46 --> 447.96
otherwise it's just a burden it would

445.919 --> 450.06
just feel just like a weakness like

447.96 --> 451.79999999999995
something I can't control and only does

450.06 --> 454.4
nothing good so

451.8 --> 454.40000000000003
I just

454.86 --> 457.759
as I said

457.8 --> 464.78000000000003
I tame the Beast put some good armor and

461.639 --> 464.78000000000003
everything on there and

467.28 --> 473.21999999999997
and instead of it just wildly popping

471.06 --> 476.4
out and destroying things

473.22 --> 480.97900000000004
I try to actually make it pull a wagon

476.4 --> 480.979
basically metaphorically anyway

481.44 --> 486.62
hello Grim Redbone wrath bone I mean

493.94 --> 500.96
snowing in the shower yeah man you're

497.16 --> 500.96000000000004
having a lot of snow over there

516.06 --> 521.0
hey Dr Bass awkward let's see you

522.419 --> 528.68
right anyway it's a bit of a short show

525.0 --> 528.68
but let's make something of it

532.72 --> 535.929
[Applause]

538.56 --> 543.5999999999999
also

541.08 --> 545.0400000000001
there's another thing playing and and

543.6 --> 546.779
you guys I don't know if you're like

545.04 --> 548.88
really on to it depends on like if

546.779 --> 552.36
you're following oh Benjamin and jimba

548.88 --> 555.779
but I mean that thing is growing

552.36 --> 558.12
it's growing really sour especially on

555.779 --> 561.4399999999999
the Jim Bob's side like he posted a

558.12 --> 561.44
couple of videos where I'm like

562.08 --> 568.339
I'm really like

564.6 --> 571.2
one step away from just

568.339 --> 573.12
unsubscribing and I don't want to be

571.2 --> 575.399
Associated anymore I mean it's getting

573.12 --> 577.5600000000001
really bad

575.399 --> 581.6
he's escalating things

577.56 --> 581.5999999999999
and it's not going to end well for him

584.7 --> 591.899
I'm really sad about it

587.58 --> 595.019
it's almost like in a way not literally

591.899 --> 596.88
though but in a way it feels like ranty

595.019 --> 599.4590000000001
all over again

596.88 --> 601.86
because Jim Bob I don't know if you guys

599.459 --> 602.76
remember this but like a year ago and

601.86 --> 606.839
all that

602.76 --> 609.0
I mean he sent me one of his books

606.839 --> 610.1400000000001
and

609.0 --> 612.54
like

610.14 --> 615.3
it was very funny

612.54 --> 618.7199999999999
but now there's just This Bitter sour

615.3 --> 621.959
seed in what he's doing and he's just

618.72 --> 626.0400000000001
turning into savanye

621.959 --> 628.68
like the the most full-blown savanye

626.04 --> 631.68
enactment that I've seen in a while

628.68 --> 634.0799999999999
and it's such a giant contrast with what

631.68 --> 637.56
it was like before that and every he's

634.08 --> 641.1800000000001
he's letting savanye mode basically grab

637.56 --> 643.9799999999999
everything and weaponizing it and it is

641.18 --> 647.76
devastating to do that on the long run

643.98 --> 650.24
pmbop and I'm very worried about you

647.76 --> 654.48
laughs

650.24 --> 657.3
and not like four for your soul how dare

654.48 --> 659.76
you now I'm thinking that you're

657.3 --> 663.66
seriously by accident

659.76 --> 665.16
took a wrong turn on your path

663.66 --> 667.74
and

665.16 --> 670.56
you should be realizing it and stop it

667.74 --> 674.3
because you're gonna be casting off

670.56 --> 674.3
things that you need

674.82 --> 679.9200000000001
for yourself and for your future for

678.06 --> 682.6199999999999
your identity

679.92 --> 687.38
for your energy maintenance and this is

682.62 --> 687.38
all bad you need to stop doing it

689.82 --> 694.9200000000001
and Owen is worried about him too I mean

692.16 --> 697.5
he makes fun of Jim Bob and all that but

694.92 --> 699.66
I mean in a way he has to because Tim

697.5 --> 703.98
Bob's really growing out of control he's

699.66 --> 707.8199999999999
he's almost going Sean Hawkins Style

703.98 --> 711.4200000000001
it's not not that [ __ ] but like

707.82 --> 714.36
just like a bloodhound with no limits

711.42 --> 717.06
and this is really bad to do for

714.36 --> 721.38
somebody that had

717.06 --> 724.6199999999999
all that fun and subtlety and well

721.38 --> 727.32
Reason Not thinks and now it's all just

724.62 --> 731.3
going to [ __ ]

727.32 --> 731.3000000000001
it makes me very sad

731.399 --> 736.5
because I thought he actually did treat

734.16 --> 739.079
me like a friend in a way

736.5 --> 741.36
and that was weird I went on there a

739.079 --> 742.92
couple of times and the last time we

741.36 --> 745.0790000000001
really bumped

742.92 --> 747.06
anyway he basically started straw

745.079 --> 748.8599999999999
Manning me because I was just so I was

747.06 --> 751.1999999999999
just trying to lightly address this

748.86 --> 752.76
subject and started like yeah I think

751.2 --> 754.26
you're like kind of straw Manning

752.76 --> 756.18
paganism

754.26 --> 757.9399999999999
I have another view of paganism like

756.18 --> 760.7399999999999
that and it was just the Civil

757.94 --> 762.7790000000001
discussion but he turned it into like I

760.74 --> 766.2
was a pagan defending

762.779 --> 769.2
what he thought was paganism

766.2 --> 770.399
and that already was like why why are

769.2 --> 773.639
you doing that

770.399 --> 776.36
like why are you suddenly

773.639 --> 778.92
putting me on a very specific

776.36 --> 781.26
Real Track

778.92 --> 782.16
within the moment it was very weird to

781.26 --> 784.74
me

782.16 --> 786.42
like I was literally confused about it

784.74 --> 788.88
when that happened and I called him out

786.42 --> 790.62
on it and then stayed very civil I did

788.88 --> 792.8389999999999
not get angry because it was just really

790.62 --> 796.32
surprised it was just like what is going

792.839 --> 798.9590000000001
on here what what are you doing

796.32 --> 801.5600000000001
right and that's that was like a week

798.959 --> 804.06
before the [ __ ] hit the fan between

801.56 --> 805.92
Benjamin and bien Bob

804.06 --> 809.279
and

805.92 --> 810.899
I don't know I really thought

809.279 --> 813.92
there's like another friend on the

810.899 --> 813.92
internet but it just

818.279 --> 823.32
I mean it can't do that

820.62 --> 827.519
because now every time I engage in Jim

823.32 --> 830.7
Bob the only impulses I have is to what

827.519 --> 835.019
would probably be seen as trolling

830.7 --> 839.279
because I have very specific views

835.019 --> 841.92
and I always just say them and if I then

839.279 --> 843.54
get shamed or attacked over it then I

841.92 --> 846.12
kind of stop

843.54 --> 849.7199999999999
coming there

846.12 --> 852.3
and I just don't feel yeah the vibe in

849.72 --> 854.1
there is just not fun anymore especially

852.3 --> 856.5
with these recent

854.1 --> 859.76
[ __ ] up uploads

856.5 --> 859.76
because those aren't

860.16 --> 863.54
it's not funny anymore

864.019 --> 870.24
jimbob used to like only

867.139 --> 872.72
upload videos if they were actually

870.24 --> 872.72
funny

872.88 --> 880.399
and he's kind of violated his own

876.139 --> 880.399
format now doing this

882.48 --> 885.72
right

884.279 --> 888.3
anyway

885.72 --> 889.5
so that's also kind of brewing in the

888.3 --> 891.8389999999999
back

889.5 --> 894.68
of my mind of course I'm not directly

891.839 --> 894.6800000000001
involved really

894.839 --> 901.22
but I'm I'm kind of pissed off at Jim

897.24 --> 901.22
Bob for doing this

901.86 --> 906.98
but I'm not gonna be like oh he's just

904.68 --> 906.9799999999999
gone

907.199 --> 912.779
E4 like in that sense it's not like

910.199 --> 914.639
Randy because ranty literally

912.779 --> 916.98
told me

914.639 --> 919.139
what he was gonna do

916.98 --> 921.66
is different

919.139 --> 924.0600000000001
I think Jim Bob really did kind of

921.66 --> 927.06
accidentally stumble down this road and

924.06 --> 928.6199999999999
now he's lost control over the stumble

927.06 --> 932.3599999999999
is just rolling

928.62 --> 932.36
and I'm worried anyway

939.0 --> 946.16
hello Darth elevator

941.899 --> 946.16
and hello dank good to see you

952.8 --> 958.74
right and in a way

956.399 --> 960.48
that sound I don't want to get emotional

958.74 --> 964.5790000000001
that's silly

960.48 --> 964.5790000000001
in a way I wish I could like

964.98 --> 971.1800000000001
medicate but it's like oh they're not

968.639 --> 971.1800000000001
gonna do that

971.88 --> 976.5
it's like

974.06 --> 979.56
I don't know man it makes me feel just

976.5 --> 982.019
like when my parents were like really

979.56 --> 984.4799999999999
getting in bad arguments with each other

982.019 --> 986.4590000000001
and it would just keep escalating

984.48 --> 989.339
I figured out that was like when I was

986.459 --> 991.8599999999999
in my teens and then I I just at some

989.339 --> 994.1990000000001
point were like I could just try to

991.86 --> 996.779
escape this and just get in a really bad

994.199 --> 999.12
mood all the time because that shit's

996.779 --> 1000.5
happening or I can actually get involved

999.12 --> 1002.54
even though I think a lot of these

1000.5 --> 1005.5
things that they bicker about are really

1002.54 --> 1005.5
gross and [ __ ] up

1005.839 --> 1009.8000000000001
foreign

1007.24 --> 1011.0600000000001
not going to get into details but I

1009.8 --> 1013.88
would just like

1011.06 --> 1016.5189999999999
okay I'm going to be your therapist now

1013.88 --> 1018.259
because I'm the only one that you cannot

1016.519 --> 1021.019
trick

1018.259 --> 1024.319
because they did try therapists

1021.019 --> 1026.179
and I was never there but they would

1024.319 --> 1028.8799999999999
always come out

1026.179 --> 1030.919
like not really change not really having

1028.88 --> 1032.9
learned a lesson it was more like they

1030.919 --> 1034.2800000000002
were able to vend off a bit and that's

1032.9 --> 1037.16
it

1034.28 --> 1039.799
so I actually started to like

1037.16 --> 1042.38
get a real communication in a heated

1039.799 --> 1044.839
situation even like they were having

1042.38 --> 1047.6000000000001
conflicts about sex and all that it's

1044.839 --> 1049.1599999999999
really [ __ ] gross like especially

1047.6 --> 1051.86
when you're a teen and they're your

1049.16 --> 1054.2
parents yeah but I [ __ ] had to do it

1051.86 --> 1056.6
I had to actually

1054.2 --> 1059.179
start just

1056.6 --> 1061.58
not just oh just say what you want just

1059.179 --> 1065.0
vent yourself and then it'll be better

1061.58 --> 1067.78
no actually like okay there is an issue

1065.0 --> 1072.679
this keeps coming back

1067.78 --> 1075.6789999999999
let's just really debate on our high

1072.679 --> 1078.74
tension and I will mitigate and and I

1075.679 --> 1080.9
then reprimanded my parents if they fell

1078.74 --> 1083.1200000000001
out of line and they would accept it and

1080.9 --> 1086.1200000000001
it was the only [ __ ] person in the

1083.12 --> 1088.34
world that was actually able to do that

1086.12 --> 1090.62
okay and it worked it actually worked

1088.34 --> 1093.5
for a while although it did eventually

1090.62 --> 1095.78
end up with them both realizing like

1093.5 --> 1097.16
yeah you've done really your best and we

1095.78 --> 1098.48
do understand each other better but

1097.16 --> 1100.76
because of that

1098.48 --> 1104.72
my dad really came to the realization

1100.76 --> 1107.539
this situation of our marriage is fubar

1104.72 --> 1110.539
I could never

1107.539 --> 1110.539
revive

1110.62 --> 1115.82
and then he decided to basically yeah

1114.2 --> 1117.799
get a divorce

1115.82 --> 1119.78
and that was a shocker that's not what I

1117.799 --> 1122.9
wanted but I mean

1119.78 --> 1125.78
it was for the better because it was

1122.9 --> 1128.0590000000002
just growing too much out of hand anyway

1125.78 --> 1129.86
all this bickering even though it's

1128.059 --> 1132.1399999999999
between friends

1129.86 --> 1133.9399999999998
out there on the internet of people that

1132.14 --> 1136.039
I haven't really met it's still kind of

1133.94 --> 1137.96
close to heart and I do feel like I wish

1136.039 --> 1139.58
I could do the same thing that I did

1137.96 --> 1141.6200000000001
with my parents and just get in there

1139.58 --> 1145.039
and like okay

1141.62 --> 1147.26
because I do get Owen Benjamin and I do

1145.039 --> 1149.12
get like his feelings and he's very

1147.26 --> 1151.22
upfront

1149.12 --> 1153.5
and I can't read it

1151.22 --> 1155.72
and I can also read Jim Bob whose

1153.5 --> 1158.559
feelings are very different so he's a

1155.72 --> 1158.559
different type of person

1159.679 --> 1165.14
as other types of demons to struggle

1161.84 --> 1167.84
with his own and it just like

1165.14 --> 1170.0590000000002
I wish I could just

1167.84 --> 1173.059
fix it again

1170.059 --> 1174.2
but I mean it's not really my place

1173.059 --> 1176.539
you know

1174.2 --> 1178.64
I mean it wasn't even really my place as

1176.539 --> 1180.2
a kid to my parents but I mean I was the

1178.64 --> 1181.88
only one that could do it and it was

1180.2 --> 1184.5800000000002
gonna be right in the middle of it

1181.88 --> 1187.179
anyway well that's not the conditions

1184.58 --> 1187.1789999999999
here right now

1187.34 --> 1190.24
sharwin

1195.32 --> 1199.0
I think we got a derp alert here

1205.28 --> 1212.1789999999999
tortures himself with semantics debate

1208.4 --> 1217.0590000000002
yeah it's really annoying

1212.179 --> 1217.0590000000002
I agree and to the luvian catharsis

1231.799 --> 1236.24
yeah now you'll find that it's absolute

1234.14 --> 1239.74
like I'm not I don't even know why I'm

1236.24 --> 1241.9
addressing this stupid garbage jokes

1239.74 --> 1244.76
definitely not

1241.9 --> 1247.3400000000001
Sean Hawkins son just look at the

1244.76 --> 1249.26
freaking way scholarship there is no

1247.34 --> 1251.559
possible way that it could ever come out

1249.26 --> 1251.559
of that

1254.0 --> 1260.9
like it doesn't matter how pronounced

1257.0 --> 1263.299
and Indonesian girl or whatever he would

1260.9 --> 1266.3600000000001
have slept with it would never result in

1263.299 --> 1268.82
this that's impossible

1266.36 --> 1271.1599999999999
and I don't know why I'm taking that

1268.82 --> 1274.24
stupid garbage joke so serious it's very

1271.16 --> 1274.24
are winning of me

1274.34 --> 1277.12
uh

1279.14 --> 1282.14
anyway

1288.26 --> 1294.52
right but yeah it's

1291.44 --> 1294.52
it's kind of lame

1295.58 --> 1299.9189999999999
and I'm noticing that I'm like re like

1302.78 --> 1307.039
like just to be clear again I'm not

1305.12 --> 1310.1789999999999
attacking you Jim Bob if you're watching

1307.039 --> 1310.179
this I really am not

1310.88 --> 1316.1200000000001
but now that I'm watching Owen Benjamin

1313.94 --> 1320.419
I watched that like four hour stream

1316.12 --> 1323.4799999999998
fully in which he really basically goes

1320.419 --> 1325.94
off with in a funny way on about Jim Bob

1323.48 --> 1328.58
and with some of his suspicions that I

1325.94 --> 1329.419
don't think are that far off probably in

1328.58 --> 1331.8799999999999
a way

1329.419 --> 1335.1200000000001
there's something going on here

1331.88 --> 1338.419
with this Brotherhood

1335.12 --> 1340.28
something weird in the shadows a weird

1338.419 --> 1342.14
energy

1340.28 --> 1345.08
and

1342.14 --> 1347.8400000000001
it's been a great relief just watching

1345.08 --> 1351.1399999999999
Owen Benjamin just

1347.84 --> 1354.08
putting it down because that stuff I've

1351.14 --> 1355.1000000000001
been worried about too with Jim Bob for

1354.08 --> 1357.3799999999999
a while

1355.1 --> 1361.059
it's been a massive relief watching just

1357.38 --> 1364.2800000000002
the streams and Owen having such a

1361.059 --> 1367.0
magnificent attitude it's really

1364.28 --> 1367.0
impressive

1369.98 --> 1375.6200000000001
like it's palpable to me that he really

1373.1 --> 1377.78
he is grilling him but he still regards

1375.62 --> 1380.0
him as a friend and sometimes I get a

1377.78 --> 1381.5
bit annoyed about that even like no you

1380.0 --> 1384.679
should probably go a bit further but

1381.5 --> 1386.78
he's really he means it it really does

1384.679 --> 1387.98
care about Jim Bob and that comes

1386.78 --> 1391.34
through

1387.98 --> 1395.3600000000001
so it's been very

1391.34 --> 1397.4599999999998
innervating like or relieving watching

1395.36 --> 1401.74
those that stream that particular stream

1397.46 --> 1401.74
but the interdimensional thing

1402.08 --> 1406.9399999999998
which by the way the interdimensional

1404.12 --> 1409.28
thing that he brought up

1406.94 --> 1411.5
it's a mind experiment

1409.28 --> 1415.12
and I think that Owen does very much

1411.5 --> 1415.12
realize it's a mind experiment

1417.44 --> 1423.64
and it is kind of interesting because

1420.86 --> 1426.799
it basically grafts in

1423.64 --> 1429.98
well-consciousness into dimensionality

1426.799 --> 1433.7
so it is kind of a weird math game it is

1429.98 --> 1436.22
it is really that it's a bit of Wizardry

1433.7 --> 1438.5
but it's relatively innocent as long as

1436.22 --> 1441.22
you don't literally start to reify that

1438.5 --> 1441.22
way of thinking

1441.26 --> 1446.299
like to really rest on if you're gonna

1444.02 --> 1450.24
rest on that things are gonna get weird

1446.299 --> 1452.24
for you you might lose your mind

1450.24 --> 1455.78
[Music]

1452.24 --> 1458.6
but I do get it I've been there

1455.78 --> 1462.6399999999999
I was kind of into that dimensionality

1458.6 --> 1462.6399999999999
even like in my late teens

1463.28 --> 1467.24
I was very fascinated by The Fifth

1465.14 --> 1469.46
Dimension I mean all of that and

1467.24 --> 1471.919
combining it with my Dark World Vision

1469.46 --> 1476.3600000000001
experiences yeah I mean

1471.919 --> 1478.2800000000002
to me is like oh another dimension yeah

1476.36 --> 1481.2199999999998
I mean that makes sense because I've

1478.28 --> 1484.22
been experiencing some other dimension

1481.22 --> 1486.74
and which is really surreal

1484.22 --> 1489.6200000000001
so

1486.74 --> 1492.14
yeah for me back then I was like yeah of

1489.62 --> 1493.8799999999999
course like that makes sense but then

1492.14 --> 1495.74
again yeah the Same by that same

1493.88 --> 1498.2
standard of thinking you can be fooled

1495.74 --> 1501.38
easily by Einstein's ideas

1498.2 --> 1505.179
right because it is a thought experiment

1501.38 --> 1505.179
just like what Einstein did

1506.6 --> 1513.799
it's just focusing on different aspects

1511.22 --> 1515.3600000000001
right it's not really regarding physics

1513.799 --> 1517.58
so much

1515.36 --> 1520.1789999999999
it's more about just the spirit and

1517.58 --> 1520.1789999999999
consciousness

1527.539 --> 1531.1
is too much in his time

1531.38 --> 1537.44
may it I don't know I don't know

1534.64 --> 1540.1000000000001
this hello by the way Bill Nye the

1537.44 --> 1540.1000000000001
science denier

1542.36 --> 1549.08
I have no idea how much Jim Bob is

1546.2 --> 1551.1200000000001
how he is spending his time but there's

1549.08 --> 1553.52
a great likelier to see if he's really

1551.12 --> 1556.34
well now making these types of attack

1553.52 --> 1558.08
videos that are really bitter

1556.34 --> 1559.82
he's going to be carrying that that's

1558.08 --> 1562.1789999999999
going to make it harder for him to

1559.82 --> 1562.1789999999999
actually

1562.46 --> 1568.22
connect on a spiritual level with his

1565.88 --> 1569.6000000000001
family you are right about that if that

1568.22 --> 1572.74
is what your

1569.6 --> 1572.74
trying to point at

1573.02 --> 1578.4189999999999
it's not good it's this being like this

1575.299 --> 1582.08
is not good for him or his family it's

1578.419 --> 1585.14
gonna raw things up it could

1582.08 --> 1588.02
like if it doesn't stop

1585.14 --> 1589.76
his wife could basically like put him on

1588.02 --> 1592.46
the spot and say like you have to stop

1589.76 --> 1596.12
now or I'm gonna go

1592.46 --> 1598.9
I mean God and I that's not fun that's

1596.12 --> 1598.8999999999999
never good

1600.38 --> 1606.2
that's devastating if you're like on a

1603.5 --> 1608.0
on a ride and you can't break loose and

1606.2 --> 1610.88
then you see

1608.0 --> 1613.82
the things that actually matter

1610.88 --> 1616.5800000000002
suddenly disintegrate that is

1613.82 --> 1618.799
devastating and I really don't want that

1616.58 --> 1620.98
to happen to him I really don't I mean

1618.799 --> 1620.98
it

1622.72 --> 1628.24
like no matter how annoying he can get

1625.52 --> 1628.24
right

1632.96 --> 1638.659
there's just things he's got a face or

1635.48 --> 1641.179
it's gonna destroy him

1638.659 --> 1643.3600000000001
and I really hope he he manages to do

1641.179 --> 1643.3600000000001
that

1644.72 --> 1649.82
and kind of

1646.7 --> 1653.919
become his old self again

1649.82 --> 1653.9189999999999
anyway enough about that

1654.26 --> 1659.05
foreign

1655.82 --> 1659.05
[Music]

1661.22 --> 1664.22
catharsis

1666.08 --> 1671.299
yeah

1668.539 --> 1672.74
I agree I'm I'm proud of that I'm proud

1671.299 --> 1676.4
that I was

1672.74 --> 1678.44
able to address it right

1676.4 --> 1680.6000000000001
because there would be all kinds of ways

1678.44 --> 1682.94
to just kind of stop no no longer

1680.6 --> 1685.1
mention it and then it would still have

1682.94 --> 1688.52
like unresolved feelings about it or

1685.1 --> 1692.0
shame or whatever the fear like not

1688.52 --> 1694.46
knowing how everybody sees it

1692.0 --> 1697.419
this is better to just

1694.46 --> 1697.419
talk about it

1697.88 --> 1702.6200000000001
and so I did and I thought I did so

1699.919 --> 1706.419
eloquently so I'm glad

1702.62 --> 1706.4189999999999
I'm glad of yesterday's show

1714.32 --> 1719.48
open shouldn't have posted the picture

1717.559 --> 1721.779
yeah but look Bill Nye the science

1719.48 --> 1721.779
tonight

1721.88 --> 1726.0200000000002
I don't know if you were there but do

1724.039 --> 1728.9
you remember how

1726.02 --> 1731.539
Jim Bob joked

1728.9 --> 1734.9
who let the dogs out when Owen literally

1731.539 --> 1738.2
just drove over his own dog and he was

1734.9 --> 1740.8600000000001
like viscerally heartbroken over that

1738.2 --> 1740.8600000000001
I mean

1741.38 --> 1746.419
Owen explained it all like the the

1744.2 --> 1749.059
preface of it all like how the build up

1746.419 --> 1751.94
to this entire situation I mean

1749.059 --> 1753.02
Owen thought like oh so you're gonna go

1751.94 --> 1755.419
there

1753.02 --> 1757.6399999999999
he did it like a bro fight so he's like

1755.419 --> 1759.44
he gets a little hard

1757.64 --> 1762.5
back

1759.44 --> 1764.3600000000001
right he called like Jim Bob's wife a

1762.5 --> 1767.12
meal order prostitute or something I

1764.36 --> 1769.76
thought it was hysterical and should not

1767.12 --> 1772.52
be taken literal of course

1769.76 --> 1775.34
right so all kinds of [ __ ] went between

1772.52 --> 1777.08
them and they they made jokes but then

1775.34 --> 1779.899
it went sour

1777.08 --> 1783.4399999999998
after that that actual face-to-face

1779.899 --> 1786.26
debate it went really sour then

1783.44 --> 1789.14
Owen was actually released when that

1786.26 --> 1791.6589999999999
happened he was like really innovated

1789.14 --> 1794.539
and he that testified to that it's like

1791.659 --> 1796.3990000000001
oh it's finally could be myself could

1794.539 --> 1799.1589999999999
just how I'm supposed to do things like

1796.399 --> 1803.2399999999998
how it works the best and Jim Bob did

1799.159 --> 1806.3600000000001
not he something locked off

1803.24 --> 1808.94
and he went down this dwelling path that

1806.36 --> 1813.02
he's on now

1808.94 --> 1815.419
but Owen has not been mean

1813.02 --> 1818.6
to him

1815.419 --> 1821.0590000000002
since then before then a bit probably

1818.6 --> 1823.1589999999999
but it's because they were really kind

1821.059 --> 1826.52
of hard joking at it with each other

1823.159 --> 1828.8200000000002
which Jim Bob started with that gruesome

1826.52 --> 1828.82
joke

1829.58 --> 1836.6589999999999
that literally when Owen was still

1831.98 --> 1840.2
emotional about it Live Jim Bob did that

1836.659 --> 1842.179
in the chat there so yeah that's messed

1840.2 --> 1844.5800000000002
up I know

1842.179 --> 1846.919
right so it was just a hard joke and

1844.58 --> 1849.3799999999999
Owen took it as a sport he was

1846.919 --> 1851.659
heartbroken then and it was it was going

1849.38 --> 1854.0
a little ah but

1851.659 --> 1855.7990000000002
I mean he took it as soon as he calmed

1854.0 --> 1858.799
out as a joke

1855.799 --> 1860.96
and thought oh okay so I got a

1858.799 --> 1863.36
challenger somebody who's gonna hard

1860.96 --> 1865.94
joke on me well that of course opens the

1863.36 --> 1869.1789999999999
door to do it back and so he did Owen

1865.94 --> 1873.919
style like old-fashioned but still in

1869.179 --> 1877.3400000000001
his mind as a as a brother in comedy

1873.919 --> 1878.659
and now Jim Bob is all hashing all that

1877.34 --> 1883.76
[ __ ] up

1878.659 --> 1886.159
like it was post offense situation like

1883.76 --> 1888.02
after the real fight after Jim Bob

1886.159 --> 1890.8400000000001
started the fight so he's actually being

1888.02 --> 1893.6589999999999
kind of a gamut piece of [ __ ] about it

1890.84 --> 1896.3799999999999
really [ __ ] up

1893.659 --> 1899.72
like that's really [ __ ] up thing to do

1896.38 --> 1902.419
IMO you should know that you should be

1899.72 --> 1904.94
ashamed of what you're doing there

1902.419 --> 1907.3990000000001
you should know better and you can't win

1904.94 --> 1911.419
this you can't

1907.399 --> 1913.1
put a blanket of Shame around Owen and

1911.419 --> 1915.26
then come out the Victor it's not

1913.1 --> 1917.059
possible you're not gonna be successful

1915.26 --> 1920.32
Jim Bob

1917.059 --> 1920.32
you better give it up

1924.44 --> 1929.659
yeah as you as Owen says when you come

1927.5 --> 1932.26
at the king you don't miss

1929.659 --> 1932.2600000000002
right

1934.88 --> 1937.88
metaphysically

1940.76 --> 1944.98
or historical however you want to see it

1953.24 --> 1956.48
[Music]

1959.48 --> 1964.52
I throw them now enter the luffian

1961.88 --> 1967.88
catharsis no I think you're sizing it up

1964.52 --> 1971.679
wrong I mean with Jim Bob yeah

1967.88 --> 1975.6200000000001
Owen Benjamin has an incredibly strict

1971.679 --> 1978.02
live chat situation happening I mean if

1975.62 --> 1980.779
you think that I'm strict and like

1978.02 --> 1982.82
really on the chat there's nothing

1980.779 --> 1986.48
compared to what Owen actually does he

1982.82 --> 1989.26
has a two-tier chat system I'm kind of

1986.48 --> 1992.299
jealous because it sounds really handy

1989.26 --> 1996.22
but I mean he's got a great organizer

1992.299 --> 1996.22
for that and moderators and

1996.38 --> 2001.0590000000002
and he's not like the yeah he's doing it

1998.779 --> 2002.559
like in a chat program I think on

2001.059 --> 2004.6
telegram or something which is very

2002.559 --> 2008.6789999999999
typical because I can't get my telegram

2004.6 --> 2012.24
to work ever like ever it's just it just

2008.679 --> 2012.24
will not work no matter what I do

2012.34 --> 2014.82
foreign

2016.2 --> 2020.3990000000001
has a much

2020.559 --> 2026.08
like his chat doesn't really

2024.179 --> 2028.779
influence him

2026.08 --> 2031.1399999999999
in that sense he really does manage his

2028.779 --> 2031.14
chat

2034.179 --> 2036.659
oh

2038.559 --> 2042.82
okay thank you dark elevator I really

2041.26 --> 2045.6589999999999
appreciate that

2042.82 --> 2045.6589999999999
let me check

2055.659 --> 2058.619
okay

2060.04 --> 2064.179
very funny

2062.2 --> 2066.46
but I'll take it

2064.179 --> 2069.159
hey if you wanna

2066.46 --> 2072.76
make the effort to send one euro

2069.159 --> 2075.4190000000003
as some kind of a joke fine I'll take it

2072.76 --> 2075.4190000000003
I don't care

2081.28 --> 2086.8
right that is not going to change much

2083.619 --> 2090.48
though but you know that right

2086.8 --> 2090.48
this part of the joke or something

2091.72 --> 2099.7799999999997
right but it's noted one Euro support I

2095.679 --> 2099.78
mean it's more than zero right

2102.54 --> 2109.8
how much I got

2104.68 --> 2109.7999999999997
no he sent me one Euro Graham Redbone

2124.619 --> 2132.1800000000003
okay all right

2127.839 --> 2132.18
so yeah I am open for a PayPal donation

2138.88 --> 2145.54
that's hysterical Graham ratbone

2142.3 --> 2149.38
I I keep calling you rat bone it's just

2145.54 --> 2151.18
wrath bone is not as easy to pronounce

2149.38 --> 2153.04
I'm sorry

2151.18 --> 2155.339
hope you don't mind being called rat

2153.04 --> 2155.339
bone

2158.5 --> 2164.339
I'll just say rat with a softened tea

2161.5 --> 2164.339
right bone

2170.8 --> 2173.88
right anyway

2177.28 --> 2183.3
already halfway the show

2179.5 --> 2183.3
rat is fine all right all right

2185.02 --> 2191.28
right so that's what I've been

2187.72 --> 2191.2799999999997
kind of sitting on me a bit

2201.64 --> 2203.8199999999997
thank you

2230.079 --> 2235.8390000000004
right and yeah man I mean

2233.44 --> 2238.0
sometimes I have these silent pauses and

2235.839 --> 2240.16
I'm like

2238.0 --> 2242.02
what have I been thinking about oh yeah

2240.16 --> 2245.0989999999997
wait I've been thinking about things

2242.02 --> 2248.2599999999998
that are so bloody

2245.099 --> 2250.839
ethereal and esoteric I don't even know

2248.26 --> 2253.7200000000003
how to translate it into words

2250.839 --> 2256.859
it's just like patterns trying to figure

2253.72 --> 2256.859
out patterns of energy

2257.98 --> 2261.88
like

2259.42 --> 2264.88
I'm even kind of frustrated that there's

2261.88 --> 2269.02
just like traits

2264.88 --> 2273.579
of human energy interaction

2269.02 --> 2275.74
that literally don't have a language

2273.579 --> 2278.92
like

2275.74 --> 2281.14
there's no naming of it it's just it

2278.92 --> 2282.339
just happens and people like they kind

2281.14 --> 2284.68
of just know

2282.339 --> 2286.5
but there's nobody knows even how to

2284.68 --> 2289.72
address it

2286.5 --> 2292.3
right and then when you see a group of

2289.72 --> 2294.22
people that suddenly don't have those

2292.3 --> 2297.76
normal human traits that are not

2294.22 --> 2300.22
unspoken about that are like weird like

2297.76 --> 2302.7400000000002
crazy trends

2300.22 --> 2305.0789999999997
that are like going completely ballistic

2302.74 --> 2307.18
and unnatural and then you suddenly know

2305.079 --> 2308.92
it's like yeah they don't have that but

2307.18 --> 2310.54
you can't address it you can't really

2308.92 --> 2312.94
pinpoint it down so it's just gonna be

2310.54 --> 2315.42
they're crazy but that doesn't explain

2312.94 --> 2315.42
anything

2315.52 --> 2320.98
so it's like

2317.92 --> 2323.38
there's so many things

2320.98 --> 2325.96
about our perceptions

2323.38 --> 2329.76
of other humans and things that just

2325.96 --> 2329.76
don't really have a language

2329.8 --> 2335.38
they're not really defined

2332.68 --> 2337.359
verbally in our understanding we just

2335.38 --> 2339.579
like we just know

2337.359 --> 2341.3199999999997
and then some people just don't know

2339.579 --> 2343.1800000000003
they just don't get it and then you say

2341.32 --> 2347.1600000000003
oh they just don't get it and but

2343.18 --> 2347.16
nobody's describing it though

2348.579 --> 2354.7000000000003
it's not like oh yeah be

2351.28 --> 2357.3390000000004
this energy that and some people might

2354.7 --> 2359.859
do that and it gets a bit new agey but

2357.339 --> 2362.04
there's just no common understanding for

2359.859 --> 2362.04
it

2362.2 --> 2367.24
and even if people get into that a bit

2365.079 --> 2368.8
and they like find a certain system with

2367.24 --> 2371.859
certain words

2368.8 --> 2374.079
and for example you start you go by Chi

2371.859 --> 2376.9
energy or something system or chakra

2374.079 --> 2378.579
energy right it means not uncommon and

2376.9 --> 2380.98
then you can get into it and you either

2378.579 --> 2382.119
hang in it and doesn't really develop

2380.98 --> 2384.579
that far

2382.119 --> 2387.6400000000003
or it just it slips away again and you

2384.579 --> 2390.6400000000003
just kind of forget about it

2387.64 --> 2393.8199999999997
and it'll still be there and it might

2390.64 --> 2396.46
still work but you then don't focus on

2393.82 --> 2399.94
it and then it just doesn't

2396.46 --> 2402.839
it just doesn't seem important anymore

2399.94 --> 2405.76
because I was a lot especially chakras

2402.839 --> 2407.38
chakras was for me like the way to kind

2405.76 --> 2411.099
of try to Define

2407.38 --> 2413.92
what the [ __ ] I was doing yeah with my

2411.099 --> 2416.98
healing and all that [ __ ] and it's like

2413.92 --> 2419.02
yeah okay this works in my hand works

2416.98 --> 2421.3
really well with my hand so that must be

2419.02 --> 2424.839
like the hand chakra because there is

2421.3 --> 2428.2200000000003
hand chakras right so that's like the

2424.839 --> 2431.619
first thing of energy

2428.22 --> 2435.04
identification notification

2431.619 --> 2437.8
that I I was able to grasp in order to

2435.04 --> 2442.02
try to explain some of these things

2437.8 --> 2442.02
that I was experiencing and able to do

2442.72 --> 2446.74
right I'm very conscious about like the

2445.18 --> 2449.5
Spectrum

2446.74 --> 2451.72
of like each chakra and what they

2449.5 --> 2454.72
actually represent

2451.72 --> 2458.2
like higher consciousness

2454.72 --> 2460.1189999999997
or I rather like higher or subconscious

2458.2 --> 2464.859
higher consciousness

2460.119 --> 2464.859
real high Consciousness observation

2465.16 --> 2471.0989999999997
like expression

2467.2 --> 2473.2
the heart which is like yeah the heart I

2471.099 --> 2476.6800000000003
mean it's the center of it all

2473.2 --> 2480.339
and then will power

2476.68 --> 2481.7999999999997
then enjoyment and pleasure and then at

2480.339 --> 2486.46
the bottom like

2481.8 --> 2486.46
sex dominant self-preservation

2486.94 --> 2492.52
and then all the other side chakras

2490.42 --> 2494.2000000000003
which to this they are still mysterious

2492.52 --> 2497.2599999999998
like I never really learned anything

2494.2 --> 2499.66
about like hand chakras and

2497.26 --> 2501.82
how they fit into that whole thing I

2499.66 --> 2504.64
mean I know practically mechanically

2501.82 --> 2507.4
what is done but I've never really like

2504.64 --> 2509.14
oh yeah these are the other chakras and

2507.4 --> 2511.119
this is how they are super significant

2509.14 --> 2516.04
just like the main ones or something

2511.119 --> 2519.4
it's never found that never got that far

2516.04 --> 2523.72
right and I never refer to shock wraps

2519.4 --> 2527.38
but I mean it's one of the first energy

2523.72 --> 2529.56
description systems that I learned as a

2527.38 --> 2529.56
teen

2529.78 --> 2536.82
so that I could finally address these

2532.599 --> 2536.82
things that I was very interested in

2538.599 --> 2543.9
spirits the spirit and your own spirit

2541.119 --> 2543.9
and your own energy

2544.06 --> 2548.5
I like learning about wait there's

2546.16 --> 2550.98
energy from myself and then there's

2548.5 --> 2553.42
energy from the outside and

2550.98 --> 2556.56
magnetization what I do is basically

2553.42 --> 2560.079
using my own energy this like

2556.56 --> 2560.74
exchanging my own physical energy in a

2560.079 --> 2565.0
way

2560.74 --> 2567.8799999999997
well Reiki the whole another thing is

2565.0 --> 2570.4
rather you don't use your energy you

2567.88 --> 2572.859
invoke the energy from the cosmos as

2570.4 --> 2575.14
they say or yeah from the astral plane

2572.859 --> 2578.38
however you wanna

2575.14 --> 2580.7799999999997
root that idea

2578.38 --> 2583.78
and then you don't use your energy

2580.78 --> 2586.6600000000003
you'll relax right because when I

2583.78 --> 2590.1400000000003
magnetize I I do this

2586.66 --> 2593.6189999999997
muscle muscle tension and then literally

2590.14 --> 2595.48
the tension is absorbed and goes into

2593.619 --> 2597.6400000000003
those muscles like I've had a really

2595.48 --> 2599.92
powerful workout

2597.64 --> 2601.72
and sometimes painful because yeah it

2599.92 --> 2605.8
can be really painful what I'm absorbing

2601.72 --> 2607.48
but I mean that doesn't Bend damage

2605.8 --> 2610.1800000000003
me

2607.48 --> 2612.64
that pain in the person might actually

2610.18 --> 2613.96
damage them a bit

2612.64 --> 2615.819
right

2613.96 --> 2618.7
but if I absorb it then it goes away

2615.819 --> 2621.46
they can relax and it comes tense in

2618.7 --> 2623.14
here but it doesn't damage me though

2621.46 --> 2626.5
that's the amazing thing about but

2623.14 --> 2628.24
that's magnetization while Reiki from

2626.5 --> 2629.619
what I've learned and might be people

2628.24 --> 2632.2
out there that do it completely

2629.619 --> 2634.839
differently or whatever this is how I

2632.2 --> 2636.5789999999997
learned it completely by myself was not

2634.839 --> 2639.7
part of a group or anything that did

2636.579 --> 2642.04
that I learned this on my own

2639.7 --> 2644.98
and always like sought test subjects hey

2642.04 --> 2647.859
can I try something on you

2644.98 --> 2650.079
like oh I hurt my knee oh can I can I

2647.859 --> 2652.359
demonstrate how I can take that away

2650.079 --> 2654.4
like I don't believe you

2652.359 --> 2656.2
and a lot of people like were nervous

2654.4 --> 2658.2400000000002
about it they didn't want it they were

2656.2 --> 2660.64
scared that it might be something weird

2658.24 --> 2662.3799999999997
or something creepy happening

2660.64 --> 2663.7
what and it would take it away and they

2662.38 --> 2665.2000000000003
would be like what the hell just

2663.7 --> 2668.14
happened

2665.2 --> 2670.359
that would be like haha magic I could

2668.14 --> 2672.819
literally absorb your pain I can even

2670.359 --> 2678.06
tell you what the pain is like

2672.819 --> 2678.06
can tell you how your pain feels ah

2679.839 --> 2685.72
right but Reiki

2682.96 --> 2689.68
doesn't do that Reiki is really more a

2685.72 --> 2692.5
what I compare to lay on hands effect

2689.68 --> 2696.22
it's very similar to what the Mormon

2692.5 --> 2699.04
priests did to me lay hands on my head

2696.22 --> 2701.14
when I was help me please I'm I'm being

2699.04 --> 2703.0
haunted by literal hallucination

2701.14 --> 2705.64
nightmares

2703.0 --> 2708.96
and then they basically perform what

2705.64 --> 2712.66
seemed like a Reiki maneuver yeah

2708.96 --> 2717.16
relaxed focused and then energy from the

2712.66 --> 2719.3799999999997
outside just comes in and that's Reiki

2717.16 --> 2723.5789999999997
it's completely the opposite really in a

2719.38 --> 2726.28
way as magnetization but I can do both I

2723.579 --> 2731.5600000000004
just really very rarely practice Reiki

2726.28 --> 2735.2200000000003
because it only really works out

2731.56 --> 2737.02
actually well in very unique moments

2735.22 --> 2739.06
and the funny thing is is that those

2737.02 --> 2741.22
unique moments you often don't even have

2739.06 --> 2743.38
to like tell people you could just

2741.22 --> 2745.06
it's like you can pray and it just

2743.38 --> 2747.6600000000003
happens

2745.06 --> 2747.66
anyway

2748.599 --> 2753.3
depends on treatments work proof what

2754.24 --> 2758.7599999999998
I don't what the hell are you talking

2756.46 --> 2758.76
about

2768.24 --> 2774.7
I've never tried what I do on cancer

2772.18 --> 2777.24
patients or anything

2774.7 --> 2777.24
foreign

2777.46 --> 2784.9
though I have actually removed some pain

2780.3 --> 2787.9
if with my mother when she had cancer

2784.9 --> 2791.2000000000003
so yeah I can take that away a bit but

2787.9 --> 2794.5
it does usually come back

2791.2 --> 2796.72
right if something is just chronic

2794.5 --> 2799.0
I can like remove all the tension I want

2796.72 --> 2801.2799999999997
but it's just gonna re-emerge then

2799.0 --> 2804.76
it's only when it's

2801.28 --> 2806.7400000000002
a temporary thing like uh I just I made

2804.76 --> 2809.079
a wrong move or I didn't sleep in the

2806.74 --> 2810.5989999999997
right position right that's where I can

2809.079 --> 2813.099
come in and just

2810.599 --> 2816.04
Rectify it

2813.099 --> 2818.38
but if it is a systemic thing in you

2816.04 --> 2820.06
because of some other issues that have

2818.38 --> 2821.319
been building

2820.06 --> 2824.38
like

2821.319 --> 2828.22
yeah I mean I could probably get some of

2824.38 --> 2830.6800000000003
the short-term pain out of there

2828.22 --> 2832.66
but I mean it's I

2830.68 --> 2834.64
I don't think I've never actually

2832.66 --> 2836.859
considered it I don't think I can like

2834.64 --> 2839.5
oh I have a tumor and you like let me do

2836.859 --> 2841.839
my thing and it just goes away I don't

2839.5 --> 2844.96
think so I never actually even

2841.839 --> 2847.06
considered that that is possible I don't

2844.96 --> 2849.339
know maybe it is like never actually

2847.06 --> 2851.0789999999997
dried it

2849.339 --> 2853.2999999999997
like

2851.079 --> 2855.46
well I tried it with my mother

2853.3 --> 2859.9
but that it didn't work

2855.46 --> 2862.9
but it's because also the energy like

2859.9 --> 2865.619
there was so much build up to her

2862.9 --> 2869.2000000000003
getting cancer that she had done so many

2865.619 --> 2872.7400000000002
bad things to herself mentally

2869.2 --> 2875.4399999999996
and physically with the Pharmaceuticals

2872.74 --> 2877.839
and she was going crazy and then

2875.44 --> 2880.2400000000002
there's like the roots become poisoned

2877.839 --> 2882.46
then yeah you can absorb all kinds of

2880.24 --> 2884.4399999999996
tensions or whatever relay energy but

2882.46 --> 2885.7
her entire system is like permanently

2884.44 --> 2887.859
[ __ ] up

2885.7 --> 2891.8999999999996
so it just doesn't matter what I would

2887.859 --> 2891.9
do it wouldn't restore her

2892.599 --> 2897.579
and I even think that that yeah in ways

2895.599 --> 2900.76
a lot of the time cancer like comes out

2897.579 --> 2902.98
of broken spiritual situations like that

2900.76 --> 2905.7000000000003
where it isn't fixed and that's why the

2902.98 --> 2905.7
cancer comes

2907.96 --> 2913.5
but yeah I mean that's

2911.8 --> 2918.3590000000004
I've never actually

2913.5 --> 2918.359
really tested that elaborately

2921.28 --> 2924.94
and to be fair I I haven't really even

2923.92 --> 2928.06
met

2924.94 --> 2931.359
a lot of people with cancer

2928.06 --> 2932.56
beside my mother after that I just never

2931.359 --> 2935.339
really

2932.56 --> 2935.339
noticed

2937.359 --> 2940.619
never bumped into any

2942.22 --> 2944.64
anyway

2946.78 --> 2951.88
and I have massive issues in any way

2949.66 --> 2954.0989999999997
with cancer like as soon as you can see

2951.88 --> 2956.5
somebody has cancer that means usually

2954.099 --> 2958.3
that they've already enrolled in the

2956.5 --> 2961.78
pharmaceutical

2958.3 --> 2964.0600000000004
medical industry concerning it and that

2961.78 --> 2967.5400000000004
is the bad thing in my opinion I think

2964.06 --> 2969.0
that the entire treatment systems

2967.54 --> 2972.099
are

2969.0 --> 2975.4
really very damaging

2972.099 --> 2977.44
and unnecessary it's just it's just

2975.4 --> 2979.1800000000003
money based

2977.44 --> 2981.46
anyway that's an entirely different

2979.18 --> 2983.9199999999996
matter

2981.46 --> 2986.4
so yeah but it is kind of the root why

2983.92 --> 2986.4
I've been

2988.96 --> 2993.28
never really hopeful for cancer people

2991.66 --> 2994.5989999999997
with cancer unless somebody's just say

2993.28 --> 2996.4
like yeah I think I might have cancer

2994.599 --> 2998.92
and they're like yeah but it will go

2996.4 --> 3001.8
away again and then I'm like yeah

2998.92 --> 3004.44
that's right baby

3001.8 --> 3006.48
because we all have cancer in us since

3004.44 --> 3009.359
we were born continually

3006.48 --> 3011.64
it's a mechanism it just does stuff and

3009.359 --> 3013.98
yeah if you then [ __ ] up your body even

3011.64 --> 3015.5989999999997
more in response to it there's a

3013.98 --> 3016.68
likelihood that it's gonna grow out of

3015.599 --> 3019.079
control

3016.68 --> 3022.14
right from a

3019.079 --> 3024.96
I really in a way see cancer as roughly

3022.14 --> 3028.2
compared as like a

3024.96 --> 3030.78
a bureau a police Bureau

3028.2 --> 3033.2999999999997
and they're like just generally around

3030.78 --> 3036.3590000000004
keeping track and then if things become

3033.3 --> 3039.119
Restless then they might deploy

3036.359 --> 3041.5989999999997
right and hope to fix the situation but

3039.119 --> 3044.579
if that doesn't actually restore order

3041.599 --> 3046.619
then they almost become militant and

3044.579 --> 3050.2200000000003
it's like it becomes almost a civil war

3046.619 --> 3053.1600000000003
situation right that's how I see cancer

3050.22 --> 3054.66
but because most cancer just it might

3053.16 --> 3057.96
grow for a bit

3054.66 --> 3060.359
and then it'll just like oh it's done

3057.96 --> 3064.2
and then it stops and it dissolves again

3060.359 --> 3064.2
it becomes digested

3070.2 --> 3072.7999999999997
right

3073.319 --> 3081.48
it's when you start poking it a lot with

3076.38 --> 3083.1600000000003
chemicals and radiation it's crazy

3081.48 --> 3085.5
to attack it

3083.16 --> 3087.72
like to basically attack the police

3085.5 --> 3090.3
force that's there for a purpose and a

3087.72 --> 3092.4599999999996
design and then yeah it's Suddenly It's

3090.3 --> 3095.28
like oh [ __ ] we're being attacked and

3092.46 --> 3099.079
then they go nuts and it's become like a

3095.28 --> 3099.079
weaponized version of itself

3099.859 --> 3105.18
some alternative doctors think cancer is

3102.72 --> 3108.18
a fungus was not literally a fungus but

3105.18 --> 3110.22
fungus fungi are involved though with

3108.18 --> 3114.24
certain cancers I think

3110.22 --> 3116.8799999999997
like Candida Canada and a very certain

3114.24 --> 3119.839
type of cancer are directly

3116.88 --> 3119.839
entangled

3120.54 --> 3127.5
so cancer is not the fungus

3123.96 --> 3131.18
cancer are very specific types of

3127.5 --> 3131.18
cells that have a function

3134.94 --> 3143.42
and what we typically get to find out as

3138.3 --> 3143.42
cancer is when it's gone out of hand

3144.42 --> 3149.46
when it won't stop growing for example

3147.0 --> 3152.22
that's clearly that that's not normal

3149.46 --> 3155.2200000000003
cancer doesn't do that normally

3152.22 --> 3156.72
usually has a very specific Target it

3155.22 --> 3158.7599999999998
grows there

3156.72 --> 3160.2599999999998
it swells up a bit might be very

3158.76 --> 3165.1800000000003
discomforting

3160.26 --> 3168.78
painful even and then it just stops

3165.18 --> 3170.7
and sometimes it hardens up

3168.78 --> 3172.8590000000004
and then yeah there's certain ways to

3170.7 --> 3174.72
get yeah you could surgically remove it

3172.859 --> 3177.42
but there's like technically other

3174.72 --> 3179.3999999999996
things in your body that can also just

3177.42 --> 3181.559
eat away at it

3179.4 --> 3183.119
certain microbials

3181.559 --> 3186.6800000000003
that do that

3183.119 --> 3186.6800000000003
and they do that in nature

3186.72 --> 3192.9599999999996
with animals in the wild too

3190.14 --> 3195.96
right but in the wild there's a lot more

3192.96 --> 3197.94
of these types of germs

3195.96 --> 3201.119
because I think they are basically germs

3197.94 --> 3202.859
that would then eat away

3201.119 --> 3208.02
the

3202.859 --> 3210.54
the old dyed dead cancer

3208.02 --> 3213.3
it would just eat it away and then it's

3210.54 --> 3215.88
like you're completely restored

3213.3 --> 3217.619
that happens in nature apparently

3215.88 --> 3220.98
it's really fascinating

3217.619 --> 3223.1400000000003
but because yeah if we live a really

3220.98 --> 3225.48
sterile life and we constantly wash our

3223.14 --> 3227.8799999999997
hands and all that [ __ ] well those

3225.48 --> 3231.92
specific types of germs

3227.88 --> 3236.78
then die off and then if you get cancer

3231.92 --> 3236.78
sadly there's a component missing

3237.38 --> 3244.02
yeah of that natural cycle so this is

3241.559 --> 3245.88
how I see it this is how I see

3244.02 --> 3248.339
things like cancer

3245.88 --> 3251.6600000000003
it's very very different from the

3248.339 --> 3251.66
allopathic medical approach

3253.26 --> 3256.1600000000003
anyways

3264.319 --> 3269.579
yes let's go homeopath totally On Target

3267.18 --> 3271.44
that's exactly what it is all disease is

3269.579 --> 3274.44
just the body trying to balance itself

3271.44 --> 3277.26
even cancer that's right

3274.44 --> 3280.319
and like they all those mechanisms are

3277.26 --> 3282.98
there they are designed to be there with

3280.319 --> 3282.98
a function

3287.28 --> 3295.8
there's no which stageo organs there's

3291.359 --> 3297.96
no vestigial mechanisms everything has a

3295.8 --> 3300.26
function always had

3297.96 --> 3303.92
and some of those functions might not be

3300.26 --> 3307.6800000000003
overly necessary anymore in the current

3303.92 --> 3310.5
conditions yeah whether those conditions

3307.68 --> 3313.3999999999996
radically change yeah you'll notice I

3310.5 --> 3316.8
guarantee it because this happens always

3313.4 --> 3319.859
unexpected old forgotten traits suddenly

3316.8 --> 3321.8390000000004
pop up right all these city folks that

3319.859 --> 3323.0989999999997
are just pampered and all that and just

3321.839 --> 3325.619
delusional

3323.099 --> 3328.579
well if something radically changes

3325.619 --> 3328.579
let's hope it doesn't

3328.92 --> 3334.619
in this instant at least but

3332.28 --> 3336.48
and they're like really put on the spot

3334.619 --> 3338.76
like it's over your life is [ __ ] over

3336.48 --> 3340.5
you can just like end it because you're

3338.76 --> 3343.3190000000004
too much of a wussy you can't handle

3340.5 --> 3347.76
anything else or

3343.319 --> 3350.579
or you can actually go at it

3347.76 --> 3354.619
and it would be a wild adventure to you

3350.579 --> 3357.96
very scary probably at times

3354.619 --> 3360.359
but then if you then go for that and

3357.96 --> 3363.599
don't just give up roll over and die

3360.359 --> 3367.44
and face the more wild situation you'll

3363.599 --> 3369.119
notice all these forgotten traits of the

3367.44 --> 3373.04
human body

3369.119 --> 3373.04
will certainly re-emerge

3373.26 --> 3376.6800000000003
because they weren't necessary before

3374.88 --> 3379.02
that because they everything is so

3376.68 --> 3381.0589999999997
comfortable and pampered and and

3379.02 --> 3384.74
suddenly all these traits that have been

3381.059 --> 3387.48
completely forgotten will just re-emerge

3384.74 --> 3391.5
and people will suddenly realize like

3387.48 --> 3394.4
wow this is so different actually and

3391.5 --> 3394.4
maybe better

3394.98 --> 3399.66
than just being surrounded by luxury and

3397.619 --> 3403.319
comfort all the time and being stuck by

3399.66 --> 3405.72
bureaucracy and paperwork

3403.319 --> 3408.66
right this is also why some people that

3405.72 --> 3410.0989999999997
are highly overworked go on a sabbatical

3408.66 --> 3413.0989999999997
and they just

3410.099 --> 3417.0
go [ __ ] off in nature with nobody around

3413.099 --> 3418.98
no cell phone or anything and just like

3417.0 --> 3421.079
go wild

3418.98 --> 3423.96
go

3421.079 --> 3428.099
go primitive

3423.96 --> 3430.2200000000003
because then that makes them feel human

3428.099 --> 3434.339
again

3430.22 --> 3436.14
anyway who created our bodies

3434.339 --> 3438.2999999999997
created them

3436.14 --> 3443.0989999999997
while our parents but

3438.3 --> 3446.2200000000003
I mean who designed it God absolutely

3443.099 --> 3449.7000000000003
all life is designed by God

3446.22 --> 3452.16
all matter in the way is arranged

3449.7 --> 3456.9199999999996
and increased the crystallization itself

3452.16 --> 3456.92
I believe is also designed by God

3459.48 --> 3464.96
or perhaps the conditions for it are

3461.94 --> 3464.96
desired by God anyway

3466.02 --> 3472.859
but I mean the overall design Dynamic of

3469.079 --> 3476.04
living things especially humans is

3472.859 --> 3477.54
absolutely astounding what what it can

3476.04 --> 3481.22
do

3477.54 --> 3481.22
and how Dynamic it is

3483.9 --> 3489.96
that is it's Dynamic with the spirit

3486.9 --> 3492.359
even so if you're like really have

3489.96 --> 3495.3
energy and you're on a mission and

3492.359 --> 3497.7599999999998
then everything also works better

3495.3 --> 3500.099
it's like your body functions better

3497.76 --> 3502.44
when you really have a mission and

3500.099 --> 3505.8
you're locked in with it

3502.44 --> 3509.04
and the energy is Flowing then the body

3505.8 --> 3510.8390000000004
starts working better

3509.04 --> 3513.18
it's like oh finally we're doing what

3510.839 --> 3515.04
we're supposed to do here spirit is

3513.18 --> 3518.66
finally doing something with us okay

3515.04 --> 3518.66
let's get to work

3519.18 --> 3521.4199999999996
foreign

3525.96 --> 3528.799
whatever man

3530.72 --> 3534.2
I don't think so

3535.26 --> 3539.2200000000003
I mean

3536.64 --> 3541.74
there might have been attempts at at

3539.22 --> 3544.2
design alterations

3541.74 --> 3546.299
of human beings

3544.2 --> 3549.14
over the

3546.299 --> 3549.14
Aegis

3549.24 --> 3552.14
could be

3552.78 --> 3556.8190000000004
why did God create retards

3557.16 --> 3563.04
uh for the contrast

3560.28 --> 3565.02
it would be the short answer right I

3563.04 --> 3568.64
mean there's no retards then how would

3565.02 --> 3568.64
you know who's actually smart

3577.88 --> 3583.6400000000003
I don't know Graham Redbone I don't know

3580.98 --> 3583.64
what he was doing

3591.18 --> 3594.0789999999997
foreign

3598.64 --> 3604.2799999999997
what the hell is that supposed to be

3600.72 --> 3604.2799999999997
anyway a lecture of life

3616.5 --> 3621.0
ah you're contradicting yourself there

3618.66 --> 3622.859
by the way perfect world is boring has

3621.0 --> 3626.42
no struggle well if it's boring then

3622.859 --> 3626.42
boredom is the struggle

3628.319 --> 3633.859
right

3629.94 --> 3633.859
what is that a good struggle

3633.9 --> 3639.78
or will it lead to actually crazier and

3637.319 --> 3643.7599999999998
crazier things that will eventually

3639.78 --> 3646.26
destroy that perfect world right

3643.76 --> 3649.079
but there's always a challenge

3646.26 --> 3651.48
I mean you can't get to any state

3649.079 --> 3653.88
without a challenge the world like this

3651.48 --> 3657.2
doesn't just doesn't work that way

3653.88 --> 3657.2000000000003
it's not designed like that

3660.78 --> 3665.299
you always get a challenge whether you

3662.76 --> 3665.2990000000004
like it or not

3668.819 --> 3674.599
yeah I've heard that blue pill Evolution

3670.92 --> 3674.599
alkaline environment

3674.819 --> 3680.839
that that's better

3677.04 --> 3680.839
to avoid cancer yeah yeah

3685.2 --> 3690.7799999999997
I don't think so dude

3688.02 --> 3693.54
I mean he was doing that

3690.78 --> 3694.27
not related to cancer he was doing that

3693.54 --> 3697.409
before

3694.27 --> 3697.409
[Music]

3697.74 --> 3702.2599999999998
yeah you don't have to say it out loud

3699.839 --> 3702.2599999999998
thanks

3702.359 --> 3707.7799999999997
why do you think I'm not saying out loud

3704.579 --> 3707.78
Out Loud come on

3715.319 --> 3718.04
right

3728.9 --> 3732.889
[Music]

3735.54 --> 3737.96
right

3743.299 --> 3748.099
anyway yeah I hope you guys are enjoying

3745.799 --> 3748.099
the show

3749.4 --> 3753.359
it's a bit of a short show but at least

3751.559 --> 3758.099
it's been very fluid

3753.359 --> 3759.839
do they even go to Euro PayPal one euro

3758.099 --> 3762.059
cool

3759.839 --> 3765.2599999999998
any more would be

3762.059 --> 3765.26
warmly welcomed

3779.76 --> 3789.1800000000003
oh also I've been coming dreaming of

3785.52 --> 3792.5
a Baldur's Gate 3 an actual one and what

3789.18 --> 3792.5
it could what could be done

3792.92 --> 3798.48
to actually continuate the story and

3795.9 --> 3801.54
I've actually come up with some really

3798.48 --> 3803.94
interesting models for that

3801.54 --> 3806.22
I'm almost nervous to talk about it

3803.94 --> 3808.5
because it might be so freaking cool a

3806.22 --> 3813.14
formula that that might be ripped off

3808.5 --> 3813.14
and then put to something else and

3815.24 --> 3821.8799999999997
but I have some inspiration for an

3819.299 --> 3823.92
actual Baldur's Gate 3 game

3821.88 --> 3826.6800000000003
that would be a literal continuation

3823.92 --> 3829.6800000000003
like after you basically

3826.68 --> 3831.8999999999996
gain access to becoming a deity and what

3829.68 --> 3834.72
you would be doing as a deity

3831.9 --> 3836.1600000000003
with an avatar which would be still your

3834.72 --> 3839.18
character

3836.16 --> 3841.68
and what you could do with that an

3839.18 --> 3844.44
interdimensionality which already exists

3841.68 --> 3846.18
is not like oh your dimension no not

3844.44 --> 3848.7000000000003
like that kind of interdimensionality

3846.18 --> 3851.339
but just the other planes right menu of

3848.7 --> 3853.2
the planes and the deities Associated

3851.339 --> 3854.16
deities and what would deities be doing

3853.2 --> 3857.3999999999996
and

3854.16 --> 3860.2799999999997
what could be the guiding story after

3857.4 --> 3862.64
that point I actually even thought of a

3860.28 --> 3862.6400000000003
title

3863.64 --> 3868.799
right

3865.5 --> 3871.98
it could be like

3868.799 --> 3874.559
the war of siric which is like the

3871.98 --> 3876.48
competing God to Bow which is like what

3874.559 --> 3878.88
you the throne that you basically attain

3876.48 --> 3881.42
and it could be expressed in different

3878.88 --> 3881.42
ways

3882.18 --> 3887.04
because I really like the idea which was

3884.94 --> 3889.44
very integrated in the game that you can

3887.04 --> 3891.18
be a really good character or a really

3889.44 --> 3893.52
evil character

3891.18 --> 3895.2599999999998
well what if you can then basically

3893.52 --> 3897.839
split the game up

3895.26 --> 3900.5400000000004
you would make two versions of the same

3897.839 --> 3902.64
game where you can literally go in

3900.54 --> 3905.46
directions and it would completely alter

3902.64 --> 3908.0989999999997
how everything unfolds

3905.46 --> 3910.799
it would be incredibly tough to actually

3908.099 --> 3912.78
make it into one game like that it would

3910.799 --> 3914.099
be incredibly complex to connect

3912.78 --> 3916.26
everything up

3914.099 --> 3918.98
but it might be super interesting if you

3916.26 --> 3918.98
could just like

3919.2 --> 3924.299
have things like you switching

3922.68 --> 3927.359
around

3924.299 --> 3929.9
like if you switch around your

3927.359 --> 3929.9
objectives

3930.72 --> 3936.0589999999997
as a deity

3932.819 --> 3938.2799999999997
that it would literally

3936.059 --> 3940.079
yeah that you could I don't know it's

3938.28 --> 3942.1800000000003
still kind of vague idea but that you

3940.079 --> 3945.559
could hop into another reality and like

3942.18 --> 3948.839
see the world as if it was actually done

3945.559 --> 3951.48
evil or good that even as an evil

3948.839 --> 3953.64
version you could go to the same

3951.48 --> 3957.0
universe that is good

3953.64 --> 3961.02
and where everything went differently

3957.0 --> 3963.78
right to really put that deity aspect on

3961.02 --> 3966.74
top of what used to be just a regular

3963.78 --> 3966.7400000000002
adventuring game

3967.579 --> 3971.04
and

3969.119 --> 3973.859
just work out something really

3971.04 --> 3976.38
interesting with that to do

3973.859 --> 3978.42
like to really still make it a

3976.38 --> 3980.4
compelling story which is what the

3978.42 --> 3984.059
wildest gay game was

3980.4 --> 3986.339
like it is really one story it is really

3984.059 --> 3991.099
like a book

3986.339 --> 3991.099
and that can be continued in my opinion

3993.839 --> 3998.94
where it's basically

3996.0 --> 4002.14
after taking the throne and what what

3998.94 --> 4002.14
you're going to do with it

4002.78 --> 4008.059
like and what does that actually mean

4005.119 --> 4010.339
among deities right it's really drawing

4008.059 --> 4012.2000000000003
the attention slightly away from the

4010.339 --> 4014.599
Realms there in the game

4012.2 --> 4016.0989999999997
towards the more the deities and what

4014.599 --> 4017.0
they're actually doing and even bothers

4016.099 --> 4019.579
gay too

4017.0 --> 4022.16
especially thrown a bill the the last

4019.579 --> 4023.96
part of the entire game franchise that

4022.16 --> 4027.92
was still Worthy

4023.96 --> 4032.7400000000002
that addressed a lot about deities

4027.92 --> 4032.7400000000002
just how they work what they do and

4032.839 --> 4038.72
there's something that can be done with

4034.819 --> 4041.66
that lore to expand and to actually put

4038.72 --> 4043.8799999999997
you in a position where you can actually

4041.66 --> 4047.68
work as a deity within the game and

4043.88 --> 4047.6800000000003
still make it a playable game

4047.74 --> 4055.0389999999998
make it with RPG Maker okay

4052.7 --> 4057.5
well I'd have to like write I would have

4055.039 --> 4060.3190000000004
to make like a giant flow chart first on

4057.5 --> 4062.0
how how such a game would actually go

4060.319 --> 4063.859
and what you would roughly be doing I

4062.0 --> 4065.619
would have to put it down as a concept

4063.859 --> 4069.14
first

4065.619 --> 4072.2200000000003
I'm now very roughly describing some

4069.14 --> 4072.22
ideas that I've had

4072.5 --> 4077.72
but it really did start out with like

4074.78 --> 4081.5
yeah you can still continue like

4077.72 --> 4084.5589999999997
throw no ball the ending is not the end

4081.5 --> 4086.48
you even have like an after Story

4084.559 --> 4088.2200000000003
whereas like yeah after you did that

4086.48 --> 4090.319
this is what happens but it's just like

4088.22 --> 4092.5989999999997
a couple of sets and this is so then

4090.319 --> 4096.88
great things happen like oh yeah

4092.599 --> 4096.88
like what let's do it

4099.92 --> 4102.88
right

4103.279 --> 4108.1990000000005
like you could make a very interesting

4105.679 --> 4110.9
situation out of it it's like okay you

4108.199 --> 4112.759
attained the Throne of ball

4110.9 --> 4114.799
and

4112.759 --> 4117.679
you can choose whether you're gonna be

4114.799 --> 4120.5
like ball evil and murderous or you

4117.679 --> 4123.4400000000005
actually rearrange the function because

4120.5 --> 4128.06
it's like a post

4123.44 --> 4129.139999999999
right the Gods like have posts there in

4128.06 --> 4131.120000000001
that system

4129.14 --> 4134.299
it's a Pantheon system and they have

4131.12 --> 4137.3589999999995
posts and whoever is on that post can

4134.299 --> 4141.259
rearrange its powers and its nature

4137.359 --> 4144.92
but when you do that logically all their

4141.259 --> 4147.679
gods it's gonna mess with the fabric of

4144.92 --> 4150.62
energy of reality itself and so other

4147.679 --> 4154.4
gods are going to object and gonna

4150.62 --> 4157.219
maybe start a war with you through the

4154.4 --> 4158.839
through the followers in the planes

4157.219 --> 4161.08
right

4158.839 --> 4164.54
and now of course there's a real big

4161.08 --> 4166.699
story logic aspect of it and that is oh

4164.54 --> 4168.5
throw the ball yeah guess what just

4166.699 --> 4169.879999999999
happened you attained the throne by

4168.5 --> 4172.4
basically

4169.88 --> 4175.96
there can be only one and you literally

4172.4 --> 4175.96
killed off everybody else

4176.6 --> 4182.42
right

4178.1 --> 4186.02
and including a lot of well your

4182.42 --> 4190.16
worshipers or your father's worshipers

4186.02 --> 4193.219
so there's certainly a giant Gap

4190.16 --> 4195.62
of worship for your deity which would

4193.219 --> 4198.38
logically weaken you in the face of the

4195.62 --> 4202.219
other Pantheon and so it could be a

4198.38 --> 4205.219
mission to rebuild up following

4202.219 --> 4207.38
in Your Vision as a deity

4205.219 --> 4209.3
in the game I'm still talking about a

4207.38 --> 4211.9400000000005
Baldur's Gate 3 game continuation

4209.3 --> 4213.24
concept just just for the just for the

4211.94 --> 4216.419999999999
record

4213.24 --> 4216.42
[Music]

4217.1 --> 4220.400000000001
I think the world view has been

4218.84 --> 4224.1990000000005
influenced by the games you've played

4220.4 --> 4224.199
yeah yeah they have

4225.679 --> 4231.38
probably better to be outside and

4227.9 --> 4233.86
interact with real nature well I I still

4231.38 --> 4233.86
do that

4246.199 --> 4251.12
right but I mean it's not exactly a

4248.9 --> 4253.299999999999
great season to be roam outside right

4251.12 --> 4253.3
now

4253.58 --> 4259.159
I mean as soon as ring really starts up

4255.98 --> 4262.099999999999
then especially somewhere I'll be

4259.159 --> 4264.379999999999
taking Works walks

4262.1 --> 4265.76
in the Parks here and all that and

4264.38 --> 4268.4800000000005
apparently by the way they're going to

4265.76 --> 4272.12
build like a new park across like the

4268.48 --> 4274.879999999999
playground over there

4272.12 --> 4278.08
got a note so they're gonna build like a

4274.88 --> 4278.08
sort of a pond

4280.04 --> 4285.92
like that's connected to the river

4283.64 --> 4288.02
and then like have a sort of a grasp or

4285.92 --> 4291.62
it's going to be a park like thingy

4288.02 --> 4294.1990000000005
instead of just a Barren grass field

4291.62 --> 4296.78
where before there was a warehouse built

4294.199 --> 4298.099999999999
on that on that strip of land and

4296.78 --> 4300.8
they're going to turn it into a little

4298.1 --> 4303.320000000001
park so okay

4300.8 --> 4305.96
they're really doing a lot of building

4303.32 --> 4308.239
nature and park thingies around I've

4305.96 --> 4310.159
noticed like this region is actually

4308.239 --> 4315.218999999999
quite voluptuous

4310.159 --> 4315.219
and what they do with nature here really

4319.159 --> 4325.009999999999
real nature is from God

4321.94 --> 4325.009999999999
[Music]

4325.1 --> 4330.320000000001
what's the point

4327.02 --> 4333.02
like I don't know that

4330.32 --> 4337.179
right but hey

4333.02 --> 4337.179
some things are not that warped

4339.32 --> 4344.179
I actually think that like the

4341.659 --> 4345.92
personalities and all that in Baldur's

4344.179 --> 4349.1
Gate are

4345.92 --> 4351.56
of a very interesting variety like

4349.1 --> 4354.08
they're real characters like with their

4351.56 --> 4356.719
own inner struggles and morale and some

4354.08 --> 4360.0199999999995
are like really evil but still

4356.719 --> 4362.36
interesting and logical and others are

4360.02 --> 4364.9400000000005
like really good

4362.36 --> 4367.219
and then they can actually be good and

4364.94 --> 4369.5
not just fake good pretentions like they

4367.219 --> 4371.54
have all of it right they have in

4369.5 --> 4374.0
Boulders gate there is a complete moral

4371.54 --> 4376.699
understanding in ways it really is there

4374.0 --> 4379.64
it's quite unique

4376.699 --> 4381.86
the conspiracy theorist style either

4379.64 --> 4385.52
it's just really a character works like

4381.86 --> 4389.12
they understand what real good is

4385.52 --> 4392.42
and how real good can be corrupted and

4389.12 --> 4397.58
fake good as well as they understand

4392.42 --> 4398.54
what true insane demonic evil is but

4397.58 --> 4402.86
also

4398.54 --> 4404.36
just happenstance evil because yeah your

4402.86 --> 4406.639999999999
life got [ __ ] up

4404.36 --> 4409.699
and you have issues

4406.64 --> 4412.64
and evil tendencies

4409.699 --> 4414.799999999999
and how that they have understanding of

4412.64 --> 4416.84
that in that game not all games are just

4414.8 --> 4418.159000000001
there to rape your mind and turn you in

4416.84 --> 4421.06
a psychopath

4418.159 --> 4421.0599999999995
tensor

4421.28 --> 4427.699
not all of them although I do agree yeah

4425.0 --> 4430.04
some of them definitely are and I avoid

4427.699 --> 4432.199
those games is

4430.04 --> 4434.659
completely

4432.199 --> 4436.58
never even look into them

4434.659 --> 4438.62
because they can already feel on the

4436.58 --> 4440.48
surface like oh this is just this is all

4438.62 --> 4442.78
just sick

4440.48 --> 4446.54
polish gate is really

4442.78 --> 4448.84
enriched in personality it's not like

4446.54 --> 4448.84
that

4451.42 --> 4456.28
and it really does provide like

4459.34 --> 4465.62
opportunities for great game experiences

4462.56 --> 4468.26
still I mean stuff in there can be

4465.62 --> 4470.0
recycled the only real issue is going to

4468.26 --> 4472.219
be how are you going to accomplish the

4470.0 --> 4474.5
same quality of music

4472.219 --> 4476.4800000000005
because even as I'm like playing the

4474.5 --> 4478.58
expansion

4476.48 --> 4482.12
for for from the original the dragon

4478.58 --> 4484.159
spear Dragon spear Wars

4482.12 --> 4486.699
Baldur's Gate one and a half which is

4484.159 --> 4489.799999999999
pretty damn good game really it's very

4486.699 --> 4492.44
loyal to the original format

4489.8 --> 4494.96
and they've in they've made some new

4492.44 --> 4497.178999999999
music some of which is actually it's

4494.96 --> 4500.9
kind of nice

4497.179 --> 4503.42
but it's not as good as the The Good the

4500.9 --> 4507.199
original music and especially the action

4503.42 --> 4508.88
they had just it had a really cohesive

4507.199 --> 4511.879999999999
type uh

4508.88 --> 4515.6
Perfection to it

4511.88 --> 4518.0
and in Polish get two as well and

4515.6 --> 4520.820000000001
the expansions probably made the music

4518.0 --> 4523.28
was made by other people or or maybe the

4520.82 --> 4524.0599999999995
same guy and he wasn't as inspired or

4523.28 --> 4528.62
something

4524.06 --> 4531.7390000000005
because it just didn't have that

4528.62 --> 4534.38
the same power

4531.739 --> 4538.299999999999
as the original what was good

4534.38 --> 4538.3
and well let's get to anyway

4538.46 --> 4542.32
I'm really into that game right now

4544.94 --> 4549.739
and it's weird because I've played that

4546.679 --> 4553.34
game hundreds and hundreds of times

4549.739 --> 4556.339999999999
but right now I'm into it in a new like

4553.34 --> 4558.26
I'm seeing more I'm seeing even more

4556.34 --> 4560.659000000001
than all those times I played it before

4558.26 --> 4563.360000000001
I see even more in it and I'm comparing

4560.659 --> 4567.5599999999995
it to other stuff out there and I'm like

4563.36 --> 4570.199
they really put real real serious

4567.56 --> 4572.92
special attention with personal

4570.199 --> 4572.919999999999
investment

4573.38 --> 4576.9800000000005
like

4574.76 --> 4581.1990000000005
people that made this game were really

4576.98 --> 4581.199
personally invested they really

4582.5 --> 4586.34
made it glorious

4589.94 --> 4595.58
and I like the characters

4593.179 --> 4599.4800000000005
I like the goofy characters

4595.58 --> 4602.0599999999995
I like the the dark characters even

4599.48 --> 4603.32
they're all very well-rounded and

4602.06 --> 4604.9400000000005
thought through and they have

4603.32 --> 4607.5199999999995
interesting among each other

4604.94 --> 4609.919999999999
conversations that actually make sense

4607.52 --> 4611.84
that are not just oh cool we can make

4609.92 --> 4614.32
them talk about something

4611.84 --> 4616.76
no they actually have

4614.32 --> 4618.92
heartfelt conversations with each other

4616.76 --> 4621.9800000000005
sometimes in opposition it's all extra

4618.92 --> 4626.02
like there's so many layers in that game

4621.98 --> 4626.0199999999995
it's crazy it's

4626.06 --> 4632.96
feels very real in so many ways anyway

4630.14 --> 4634.34
enough about that Baldur's Gate I'm very

4632.96 --> 4636.62
impressed

4634.34 --> 4640.900000000001
to me that's one of the best

4636.62 --> 4640.9
role-playing games that has ever existed

4641.3 --> 4649.2390000000005
not based on Graphics quality although

4644.84 --> 4649.2390000000005
its Graphics are great I love it

4649.34 --> 4652.58
but it's

4650.78 --> 4653.96
how the story is written how the

4652.58 --> 4656.96
characters are written how the voice

4653.96 --> 4660.199
acting is is absolutely

4656.96 --> 4661.94
the best game I've ever come across game

4660.199 --> 4664.219
series

4661.94 --> 4666.08
it really is and there's other really

4664.219 --> 4669.88
good games that are very popular that

4666.08 --> 4669.88
have been played a lot and still they

4671.719 --> 4676.04
the replay value

4673.64 --> 4678.820000000001
compared to for me Baldur's Gate is

4676.04 --> 4678.82
extremely low

4680.48 --> 4685.459999999999
I mean I don't know any other games that

4683.36 --> 4686.42
I've played like hundreds of times like

4685.46 --> 4688.96
that

4686.42 --> 4691.58
that are story driven I mean I've played

4688.96 --> 4694.94
strategy games like for example

4691.58 --> 4698.0599999999995
civilization five a lot of times sure

4694.94 --> 4700.699
but there's no story there doesn't mean

4698.06 --> 4703.159000000001
there's interesting music at best

4700.699 --> 4705.678999999999
while this gate is a story and I've read

4703.159 --> 4709.599999999999
the through that story hundreds of times

4705.679 --> 4709.6
and it still compels me

4717.32 --> 4721.0
the [ __ ] are you talking about

4721.4 --> 4727.0599999999995
what do you mean a time for games is

4723.14 --> 4727.06
over I make games

4737.659 --> 4740.98
like what are you talking about

4742.58 --> 4747.5
I'm studying games and I'd love making

4745.58 --> 4749.179
games did you know that that's like the

4747.5 --> 4751.34
thing that I actually wanted to do with

4749.179 --> 4754.159
my life

4751.34 --> 4757.58
and then I figured out that that entire

4754.159 --> 4761.739
field is run by [ __ ] and

4757.58 --> 4761.739
and the competition is just murdering

4763.699 --> 4767.98
and not as pleasant as you would think

4771.5 --> 4775.94
and like you don't get control over

4773.719 --> 4777.7390000000005
anything like oh you got a project oh

4775.94 --> 4780.379999999999
well then the money is going to dictate

4777.739 --> 4784.48
what it's going to become and not not

4780.38 --> 4784.4800000000005
your vision a lot of the time

4787.219 --> 4792.38
but it's a weird thing for somebody here

4789.739 --> 4794.54
in the chat with a wrench no Lester tell

4792.38 --> 4797.8
me the time for games is over I'm like

4794.54 --> 4797.8
what are you talking about

4801.92 --> 4806.659
right

4804.26 --> 4810.26
and sure I'd love to start a family but

4806.659 --> 4814.099999999999
yeah doing what some shitty job or can't

4810.26 --> 4816.08
play games I can't what

4814.1 --> 4819.820000000001
doesn't make any sense

4816.08 --> 4819.82
what you're saying there tensor

4831.98 --> 4836.0
as long as you don't spend a ridiculous

4833.84 --> 4838.52
amount of hours with them it's all right

4836.0 --> 4841.719
yeah well I don't play it like hours and

4838.52 --> 4841.719
hours and hours on end

4846.679 --> 4852.4400000000005
I mean what I do a lot and it's funny

4849.739 --> 4856.099999999999
because I even used to do that like

4852.44 --> 4858.259999999999
in the early years of playing the game

4856.1 --> 4861.7390000000005
back then I would like watch television

4858.26 --> 4864.679
and play a game at the same time now I

4861.739 --> 4866.54
watch a video a lot of the times

4864.679 --> 4869.78
in the background as I'm playing the

4866.54 --> 4872.719
game just listening right

4869.78 --> 4875.12
so it's not like I only play that game

4872.719 --> 4877.52
and nothing else I mean dude I've played

4875.12 --> 4879.62
it hundreds of times it's like it cannot

4877.52 --> 4882.56
even do that

4879.62 --> 4885.33
so can somebody say something again in

4882.56 --> 4887.780000000001
my chat for crying out loud

4885.33 --> 4892.239
[Music]

4887.78 --> 4892.239
how much you donated one euro

4894.38 --> 4898.46

4896.659 --> 4900.379999999999
troll

4898.46 --> 4901.1
so I didn't get really anything out of

4900.38 --> 4902.6
it

4901.1 --> 4905.42
