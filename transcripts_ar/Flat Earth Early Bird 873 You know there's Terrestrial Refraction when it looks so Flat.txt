cloudy hazy i saw quite a few

trails this morning when it was still a

99.119 --> 103.28
little bit more clear

100.079 --> 105.67999999999999
and now it's just hazed up like this

103.28 --> 105.68
weird

106.72 --> 110.079
despite that there's still plenty of

109.52 --> 112.88
warmth

110.079 --> 116.079
out here seems like it's a little bit

112.88 --> 116.079
more moist than average

116.159 --> 119.84

119.28 --> 122.88
there in

119.84 --> 124.64

196.84 --> 201.04
ah right

201.44 --> 213.12
so it is saturday the 24th

204.799 --> 216.48000000000002
of april 2021

213.12 --> 221.84
uh over in flat earth debate land and

216.48 --> 226.07999999999998
brandon's the whole situation with the

221.84 --> 227.84
supposed picture proving the ball

226.08 --> 229.68
even though it actually turns out to be

227.84 --> 232.159
a black swan

229.68 --> 233.12
and ranty oddly defending the ball in

232.159 --> 236.879
that

233.12 --> 236.879
it's still roaming on

237.12 --> 240.799
it's got our full attention or at least

239.36 --> 244.48000000000002
the attention of the guys

240.799 --> 248.31900000000002
me i don't know what it is

244.48 --> 249.84
but i'm just i'm pretty distracted by

248.319 --> 253.83999999999997
other stuff

249.84 --> 254.31900000000002
personal stuff because i don't know man

253.84 --> 256.88
maybe

254.319 --> 258.639
yeah it could be that the spring hitting

256.88 --> 261.44
just

258.639 --> 261.44
is doing that

262.16 --> 268.47900000000004
right it's happened it's happened before

266.08 --> 273.19899999999996
many many times like unless i'm like

268.479 --> 273.199
really busy like very busy

273.44 --> 282.8
during springtime especially socializing

276.56 --> 286.4
i tend to get like weird dips

282.8 --> 289.759
sort of like depression but it's

286.4 --> 291.28
yeah i know what this is right so i kind

289.759 --> 295.52000000000004
of feel kind of lonely

291.28 --> 299.03999999999996
but yeah then again i got you guys

295.52 --> 302.15999999999997
but that's all through the internet

299.04 --> 304.72
and i got my friend that i can talk on

302.16 --> 306.16
the phone with that's really still very

304.72 --> 309.84000000000003
close

306.16 --> 311.199
and yeah i got great people like samson

309.84 --> 314.15999999999997
who really gets it

311.199 --> 314.639
when i feel like this he's always been

314.16 --> 318.0
very

314.639 --> 321.759
supportive when i get like this and i

318.0 --> 325.84
really appreciate him for that

321.759 --> 325.84000000000003
for just you know

326.8 --> 330.08
doing yeah i don't know he really

329.12 --> 332.8
understands it

330.08 --> 335.19899999999996
and he's just very supportive i really

332.8 --> 337.44
appreciate him for that

335.199 --> 339.36
he did that last time too when i got

337.44 --> 341.52
like really sick and all that

339.36 --> 343.12
right have you watched level yet yes i

341.52 --> 346.71999999999997
have

343.12 --> 347.68
rocket blimps i sort of reviewed it

346.72 --> 352.96000000000004
yesterday

347.68 --> 355.919
shortly in short fashion but

352.96 --> 357.68
yeah it's it's a decent documentary it's

355.919 --> 361.039
not perfect

357.68 --> 364.24
it's a little superficial in a way

361.039 --> 364.8
but yeah the production quality was

364.24 --> 368.639
great

364.8 --> 373.199
and there's still plenty of

368.639 --> 380.40000000000003
yeah oh spewing

373.199 --> 383.84000000000003
okay what

380.4 --> 387.59999999999997
right it's it's just it's a good intro

383.84 --> 387.59999999999997
video for people

388.08 --> 394.15999999999997
right no black swan mansion yeah that is

392.319 --> 397.84000000000003
that is right but they did mention

394.16 --> 397.84000000000003
relative density among others

400.56 --> 409.84
but yes oddly enough yeah the black swan

403.199 --> 409.84000000000003
did not get a mention i don't know why

414.639 --> 419.919
i don't know why it's weird they should

420.84 --> 423.84
have

428.08 --> 431.199
all right anyway

433.599 --> 440.56
good to have you in chat

437.039 --> 442.639
hope more will get in soon so i can have

440.56 --> 444.56
a conversation rolling

442.639 --> 446.96000000000004
i was really looking forward to it

444.56 --> 451.84
because yeah man this morning i

446.96 --> 451.84
i'm not feeling all that great

456.479 --> 464.15999999999997
had a weird situation yesterday

460.0 --> 466.72
by the way it's like

464.16 --> 469.03900000000004
getting toilet paper at the supermarket

466.72 --> 471.12
that i usually only go to to get toilet

469.039 --> 474.31899999999996
paper

471.12 --> 474.8
and yeah and there were like these three

474.319 --> 478.08000000000004
guys

474.8 --> 481.919
out there like i think they were

478.08 --> 485.919
like teenagers or probably

481.919 --> 487.19899999999996
and they were like i guess making fun of

485.919 --> 490.24
me

487.199 --> 493.599
as i just literally was parking my bike

490.24 --> 496.8
like not even a meter away from them

493.599 --> 497.12
and they were like i guess trying to say

496.8 --> 499.44
oh

497.12 --> 501.28000000000003
like i was a gothic or something and

499.44 --> 505.12
that i was messed up because of

501.28 --> 506.96
getting chained up or something they had

505.12 --> 509.52
some really weird

506.96 --> 510.63899999999995
fantasy and they were basically just

509.52 --> 512.8
saying it out loud

510.639 --> 514.719
right there where i was standing

512.8 --> 516.56
thinking that i wouldn't pick up on them

514.719 --> 520.399
or that i was deaf

516.56 --> 520.8
so i kind of like faced them told them

520.399 --> 523.839
like

520.8 --> 525.3599999999999
yeah no thanks

523.839 --> 527.0400000000001
i could have said more i could have said

525.36 --> 530.32
like uh

527.04 --> 532.8389999999999
dude have fun with that gay orgy you

530.32 --> 535.44
three are having later

532.839 --> 538.0
but yeah

535.44 --> 539.519
i didn't do that because i i don't know

538.0 --> 540.0
i was kind of feeling weak in that

539.519 --> 543.519
moment

540.0 --> 546.56
i've been i've had i've had like

543.519 --> 549.839
bits where i just feel demoralized

546.56 --> 551.1199999999999
and it's kind of it's kind of a waste

549.839 --> 553.519
because

551.12 --> 554.72
when i don't feel like that people don't

553.519 --> 557.279
act like that

554.72 --> 559.279
i radiate more strength people respect

557.279 --> 561.68
me enough to not do that

559.279 --> 562.32
because they know they'd be in trouble

561.68 --> 565.279
because

562.32 --> 567.6
i would basically act out more dominant

565.279 --> 569.92
not violent but just

567.6 --> 571.839
i would be too strong for that so it's

569.92 --> 573.8389999999999
very typical it's like a sign for me

571.839 --> 574.9590000000001
that when people start doing that right

573.839 --> 577.6800000000001
in front of me

574.959 --> 579.04
that means i must be not very strong in

577.68 --> 582.3199999999999
that moment

579.04 --> 584.399
right so what to me it was like okay

582.32 --> 587.0400000000001
okay so we're there right now i have to

584.399 --> 587.04
deal with this

587.2 --> 591.44
but it was weird because when i

589.279 --> 593.68
basically said that to their face

591.44 --> 595.2
i literally faced them looked them

593.68 --> 597.92
towards the eyes

595.2 --> 599.9200000000001
and they were like just autistically

597.92 --> 601.1999999999999
continuing the conversation like they

599.92 --> 604.4799999999999
didn't even

601.2 --> 606.9590000000001
see i was there looking at it

604.48 --> 608.16
even though they were literally sort of

606.959 --> 612.2399999999999
making fun

608.16 --> 614.7199999999999
about me that was weird man

612.24 --> 615.839
like there's people out there that are

614.72 --> 619.0400000000001
just really

615.839 --> 621.44
weird these guys must be like

619.04 --> 622.16
gammas completely addicted to phones and

621.44 --> 625.44
just

622.16 --> 626.88
kind of trollish so at some point i

625.44 --> 630.839
thought

626.88 --> 633.8389999999999
do these guys actually know i'm like a

630.839 --> 633.839
youtuber

634.48 --> 637.279
probably not

639.44 --> 645.6800000000001
but it was weird to kind of see like

642.64 --> 649.279
troll types in the real world and that

645.68 --> 649.279
they're just a bunch of teenagers

650.56 --> 655.1199999999999
it was odd and when i say teenagers i

654.32 --> 660.1600000000001
kind of

655.12 --> 664.48
mean between 16 and 20 or something

660.16 --> 675.8389999999999
all right hello ralph rodriguez

664.48 --> 675.839
dmk 2020 good to see you guys

682.88 --> 689.4399999999999
right so anyway as for what i was doing

686.839 --> 691.44
yesterday

689.44 --> 693.36
the flat earth debates nathan was just

691.44 --> 697.2790000000001
having the time of his life he was in a

693.36 --> 697.279
really good mood he had so much fun

697.36 --> 704.0
having figured out how much how diffused

700.959 --> 707.5999999999999
the whole new picture supposedly proving

704.0 --> 707.6
curve situation really is

709.04 --> 715.4399999999999
and yeah i could barely get in there i

712.16 --> 718.48
i actually slept during a part of it

715.44 --> 723.36
i got seriously fatigued

718.48 --> 726.24
after my show and just slept

723.36 --> 727.519
for like an hour like st i was still

726.24 --> 729.76
sort of listening but

727.519 --> 731.6
it was like half in between dream space

729.76 --> 733.92
because i was just exhausted all of a

731.6 --> 733.9200000000001
sudden

734.24 --> 739.519
which typically correlates with me being

736.8 --> 739.519
in this state

740.959 --> 747.4399999999999
autistically right

744.959 --> 748.88
yeah those kids were really acting kind

747.44 --> 751.7600000000001
of like autistically it's

748.88 --> 751.76
it's pretty sad

756.639 --> 762.9590000000001
that guy you were having a go

759.76 --> 766.24
at the other day is

762.959 --> 770.959
he that infamous guy on youtube

766.24 --> 774.0
who put a b in a jar what

770.959 --> 778.079
then this little man in his paints

774.0 --> 778.079
i have no idea what you're saying

782.079 --> 787.8389999999999
guy i was having a go at who are you

784.8 --> 787.8389999999999
talking about

796.24 --> 802.9590000000001
i dmk i have no idea what you're saying

799.839 --> 802.9590000000001
dmk 2020

809.279 --> 815.36
the one you told to kill himself

812.639 --> 816.16
i don't know who he was he is just a

815.36 --> 819.519
troll

816.16 --> 822.24
and he actually stalks me over the phone

819.519 --> 822.88
sending me text messages and [ __ ] so i

822.24 --> 827.6800000000001
don't know

822.88 --> 827.68
literally who he is i just know

827.839 --> 833.6800000000001
that he is like a serious pathetic piece

831.68 --> 835.92
of [ __ ]

833.68 --> 835.92
right

838.48 --> 843.12
would it be it i don't know he's a

841.76 --> 846.399
faceless sock troll

843.12 --> 849.199
he makes socks sock accounts

846.399 --> 849.199
he calls me

850.32 --> 853.36
or well yeah he called me on the phone

852.24 --> 855.36
too

853.36 --> 857.92
and there is a number that has actually

855.36 --> 861.12
shown i think it's

857.92 --> 861.76
i think he's from england and he's been

861.12 --> 864.0
at it

861.76 --> 865.76
for a while but like recently he's been

864.0 --> 867.839
really tenacious

865.76 --> 869.279
and apparently he is also kind of

867.839 --> 871.839
obsessed

869.279 --> 873.8389999999999
with my friendship with nathan because

871.839 --> 874.399
he's constantly trying to tell me like

873.839 --> 876.639
oh

874.399 --> 877.92
nathan is doing this and that and he

876.639 --> 881.279
doesn't respect you and

877.92 --> 883.68
oh like he really doesn't like that

881.279 --> 885.68
we're friends

883.68 --> 888.3199999999999
i like to think that i'm friends with

885.68 --> 891.519
nathan i hope he thinks the same

888.32 --> 894.5600000000001
he does actually say

891.519 --> 894.5600000000001
nice things about me

895.76 --> 902.3199999999999
unlike a lot of people

899.279 --> 905.12
he gives me praise for the good activity

902.32 --> 905.12
that i do have

906.48 --> 910.5600000000001
and he really doesn't like it so he

908.48 --> 913.1990000000001
wants me to kind of abandon him

910.56 --> 915.3599999999999
or something which is just absolutely

913.199 --> 917.3599999999999
ridiculous

915.36 --> 920.399
was nathan that got me to do the early

917.36 --> 927.279
word show in the first place

920.399 --> 930.959
hello nathan r good to see you

927.279 --> 933.199
right so i don't know who that guy is

930.959 --> 935.1199999999999
if i had actually some kind of

933.199 --> 937.4399999999999
pinpointable identity

935.12 --> 939.519
then i probably never never got to

937.44 --> 942.9590000000001
saying that because

939.519 --> 945.92
if you're actually a person

942.959 --> 948.079
that's like you don't have to be your

945.92 --> 949.04
address known and your actual name and

948.079 --> 951.7589999999999
all that

949.04 --> 955.8389999999999
you know but if you're out there and you

951.759 --> 955.839
basically attain an identity

956.079 --> 959.4399999999999
in the community in chat rooms and all

959.12 --> 961.519
that

959.44 --> 963.12
where you're where you're getting known

961.519 --> 964.88
to be specifically a person

963.12 --> 966.9590000000001
and your voice is recognized then i

964.88 --> 970.16
would never say that

966.959 --> 974.3199999999999
never because it's a real person

970.16 --> 979.279
who's actually putting themselves down

974.32 --> 979.279
and then i would never say that ever

981.12 --> 984.16
i think that way in the past i think i

983.44 --> 986.8800000000001
might have

984.16 --> 988.7199999999999
said something like like it to mark

986.88 --> 991.279
taylor though

988.72 --> 993.519
who is a real person but he's pretty

991.279 --> 996.079
repulsive

993.519 --> 998.72
and yeah i'm never doing that again that

996.079 --> 1001.519
felt like a real big mistake

998.72 --> 1002.9590000000001
right it feels in general like a big

1001.519 --> 1003.759
mistake to tell people to kill

1002.959 --> 1006.399
themselves

1003.759 --> 1006.88
that's why i try to avoid that it's just

1006.399 --> 1009.68
that

1006.88 --> 1013.759
some people that like really anonymously

1009.68 --> 1013.7589999999999
stalk and troll get really disgusting

1014.88 --> 1024.88
i just really mean it i really do

1019.759 --> 1026.64
i i i can just swipe it aside but hey if

1024.88 --> 1030.4
you catch me in a bad mood

1026.64 --> 1035.1200000000001
i will just say it because i mean it

1030.4 --> 1035.1200000000001
right if it's a real person

1035.52 --> 1039.039
who's actually putting themselves down

1037.679 --> 1042.799
even halfway

1039.039 --> 1046.959
right i would never say that

1042.799 --> 1050.84
like for example rumpus right

1046.959 --> 1052.0800000000002
rumpus is sort of anonymous we know his

1050.84 --> 1055.4399999999998
voice

1052.08 --> 1058.24
we know his opinions we he has distinct

1055.44 --> 1059.44
like an internet identity despite his

1058.24 --> 1061.76
anonymity i would

1059.44 --> 1063.44
never tell him something like that ever

1061.76 --> 1064.96
not that i think he deserves it even

1063.44 --> 1068.559
though he is

1064.96 --> 1070.4
rumpus right psychological warfare agent

1068.559 --> 1073.6
for the ball

1070.4 --> 1077.1200000000001
i would never tell him that

1073.6 --> 1079.9189999999999
because he's at least

1077.12 --> 1082.3999999999999
a consistent person even though halfway

1079.919 --> 1085.3600000000001
anonymous

1082.4 --> 1087.8400000000001
he's still putting himself out there as

1085.36 --> 1090.24
the rumpus

1087.84 --> 1091.6789999999999
for a long period right i hope this

1090.24 --> 1095.84
makes sense i hope you guys

1091.679 --> 1095.8400000000001
care at all right

1097.12 --> 1100.6399999999999
if you want to share your insider

1099.36 --> 1103.1999999999998
opinion about it

1100.64 --> 1105.679
about my conduct in this i i would

1103.2 --> 1107.8400000000001
appreciate it

1105.679 --> 1109.679
and i would also understand if people

1107.84 --> 1111.76
that i actually respect

1109.679 --> 1114.16
would tell me like just never do that

1111.76 --> 1117.12
again i would get it

1114.16 --> 1119.76
but it seems so far that you guys seem

1117.12 --> 1119.76
to actually

1120.84 --> 1124.3999999999999
understand

1122.08 --> 1125.52
i'm not yeah that's the impression i got

1124.4 --> 1129.679
yesterday

1125.52 --> 1129.679
at least from when i was doing that

1130.559 --> 1133.76
classical homeopath i like rumpus nathan

1132.96 --> 1137.44
let

1133.76 --> 1139.679
him talk more low yeah i agree

1137.44 --> 1140.88
but it's also that there's just a

1139.679 --> 1144.16
history between them

1140.88 --> 1146.0800000000002
you know like qe is

1144.16 --> 1147.52
very little tolerance for rumpus and

1146.08 --> 1151.1999999999998
nathan

1147.52 --> 1153.6
gets into high gear

1151.2 --> 1155.44
tea bagging mode very quickly with

1153.6 --> 1158.32
rumpus

1155.44 --> 1160.64
and it is kind of a pit yeah it's a bit

1158.32 --> 1163.52
of a waste because rumpus can have like

1160.64 --> 1166.24
a really hilarious

1163.52 --> 1168.8799999999999
moments if you just give him the room to

1166.24 --> 1168.88
do his thing

1172.48 --> 1176.96
so many british flops what is the thopps

1175.919 --> 1180.16
i don't know

1176.96 --> 1180.16

1219.52 --> 1224.48
posh british type right rocket blimps

1222.159 --> 1225.8400000000001
well there's a whole bunch of posh

1224.48 --> 1228.96
british types out there

1225.84 --> 1228.9599999999998
a whole lot so

1229.12 --> 1235.84
thorpe i don't know what that means

1239.679 --> 1249.8400000000001
hey hello random good to see you

1259.28 --> 1263.84
all right

1266.559 --> 1277.84
but any opinions on that

1288.84 --> 1291.84
hmm

1294.32 --> 1300.559
right so i've got some rumors

1297.6 --> 1300.559
from samson

1301.36 --> 1305.84
oh man

1306.0 --> 1311.36
right yeah my my little finger wound did

1309.039 --> 1314.48
heal up but it's

1311.36 --> 1314.4799999999998
it looks terrible

1315.12 --> 1320.9599999999998
but yeah it'll be all right it just

1318.24 --> 1320.96
looks terrible

1324.24 --> 1328.559
but i got some tip a tip from samson who

1327.039 --> 1332.0
says that

1328.559 --> 1335.9189999999999
he's been following q activity

1332.0 --> 1337.679
through chat rooms he really is yeah

1335.919 --> 1339.2800000000002
he's told me before like he really likes

1337.679 --> 1341.1200000000001
to dig in chat rooms and he kind of

1339.28 --> 1344.84
stays in the background but just keeps

1341.12 --> 1346.32
track of like what's happening and he

1344.84 --> 1349.12
says

1346.32 --> 1349.84
that there's recently been a lot of flat

1349.12 --> 1353.1999999999998
earth

1349.84 --> 1357.1999999999998
information drops pretty high quality

1353.2 --> 1358.96
within really big q chat rooms

1357.2 --> 1360.48
and that there's been a lot of good

1358.96 --> 1363.8400000000001
responses now

1360.48 --> 1366.24
like these are potentially like hundreds

1363.84 --> 1368.799
of thousands of people

1366.24 --> 1370.159
and he was quite exhilarated about it

1368.799 --> 1372.08
and said okay keep an

1370.159 --> 1373.2
eye out because you might just be

1372.08 --> 1375.52
getting

1373.2 --> 1377.2
a whole bunch of people just appearing

1375.52 --> 1380.559
on the scene

1377.2 --> 1381.039
that are more forward because they're

1380.559 --> 1384.8799999999999
like

1381.039 --> 1385.52
cute people who may turn out to kind of

1384.88 --> 1388.5590000000002
like

1385.52 --> 1391.76
get into it with us so that

1388.559 --> 1393.6789999999999
yeah that is a good rumor right i don't

1391.76 --> 1403.84
know if it'll actually happen

1393.679 --> 1403.8400000000001
but it could

1404.24 --> 1407.679
and that that would be very interesting

1406.88 --> 1411.2
because the q

1407.679 --> 1417.8400000000001
people they do have like

1411.2 --> 1417.8400000000001
there's issues but they do

1420.24 --> 1426.48
they do have good spirit they're

1423.44 --> 1427.2
sometimes just a little easily led

1426.48 --> 1430.64
astray

1427.2 --> 1432.48
kind of way right

1430.64 --> 1433.919
maybe a little gullible but at the same

1432.48 --> 1437.279
time very spirited

1433.919 --> 1441.6000000000001
and like not afraid

1437.279 --> 1445.84
to oppose big things

1441.6 --> 1447.84
and that's great

1445.84 --> 1450.72
that's how i heard of this channel

1447.84 --> 1450.72
nathan r what

1450.88 --> 1453.1200000000001
what

1456.84 --> 1463.1999999999998
really you did kind of join up

1460.88 --> 1465.44
like when was it like last week or two

1463.2 --> 1470.72
weeks ago

1465.44 --> 1470.72
so you got here through a cute chat room

1471.52 --> 1487.84
nathan r

1496.37 --> 1502.6399999999999
[Music]

1497.76 --> 1502.64
yeah good servant posing big things

1510.24 --> 1516.799
right also

1513.36 --> 1519.76
i've been hearing more yeah wait

1516.799 --> 1522.1589999999999
person q follower at the supermarket

1519.76 --> 1522.1589999999999
told me

1522.24 --> 1524.48
huh

1526.0 --> 1529.919
whoa a cute person told you about flat

1528.799 --> 1533.6
earth

1529.919 --> 1536.0800000000002
in the supermarket wow

1533.6 --> 1536.08
awesome

1537.84 --> 1545.4399999999998
that's cool man

1542.08 --> 1547.76
do you still hear from zach

1545.44 --> 1547.76
what

1552.32 --> 1557.84
what zack

1574.32 --> 1577.84
are you talking about good servant

1580.48 --> 1584.32
right anyway i've been hearing more and

1583.44 --> 1588.559
more

1584.32 --> 1591.76
that it's not just me

1588.559 --> 1595.039
when yeah people you know basically

1591.76 --> 1597.36
start suddenly

1595.039 --> 1598.72
breaking off in a conversation and start

1597.36 --> 1602.799
telling

1598.72 --> 1602.799
you forgot okay well this is

1605.919 --> 1614.0800000000002
right but that people basically

1610.72 --> 1618.559
that you know come up to you and then

1614.08 --> 1620.3999999999999
in full enthusiast enthusiasm

1618.559 --> 1622.559
oh zack sterling right now i haven't

1620.4 --> 1624.96
heard from him in a while

1622.559 --> 1627.36
he's probably just moved on to other

1624.96 --> 1631.6000000000001
places

1627.36 --> 1635.36
right i remember i remember him right

1631.6 --> 1637.9189999999999
let me try to finish this thought

1635.36 --> 1639.76
apparently i'm not the only one bumping

1637.919 --> 1640.0
into people that you've kind of gotten

1639.76 --> 1644.24
to

1640.0 --> 1647.6
know that enthusiastically tell you

1644.24 --> 1650.799
like oh i just got the vaccine

1647.6 --> 1651.4399999999998
the corona vaccine so happy about it

1650.799 --> 1656.72
right

1651.44 --> 1656.72
that seems to be like a genuine plague

1658.96 --> 1663.279
apparently a lot of people have this

1661.919 --> 1666.5590000000002
attitude

1663.279 --> 1670.559
and if you know what it is

1666.559 --> 1674.0
what it does it's extra horrifying

1670.559 --> 1676.0
so my friend i talked to over the phone

1674.0 --> 1677.919
basically had these stories too where

1676.0 --> 1681.12
she was just

1677.919 --> 1682.0
like getting yeah she has a lot more

1681.12 --> 1683.4399999999998
people that she

1682.0 --> 1685.44
contacts she doesn't have like an

1683.44 --> 1688.24
internet place

1685.44 --> 1689.1200000000001
she just has a lot of friends over her

1688.24 --> 1692.159
life

1689.12 --> 1695.4399999999998
she easily more easily does find

1692.159 --> 1698.0800000000002
people to basically connect with

1695.44 --> 1700.159
and that just several of them even

1698.08 --> 1700.6399999999999
approached her like oh i got the vaccine

1700.159 --> 1706.159
so this

1700.64 --> 1706.159
is apparently a thing that happens a lot

1709.12 --> 1712.32
it's pretty messed up

1714.32 --> 1717.76
and every time it happens like if you

1716.72 --> 1720.32
know you get

1717.76 --> 1722.32
you know the feeling probably you guys

1720.32 --> 1725.9189999999999
in chat you know like

1722.32 --> 1728.96
yeah this world is [ __ ]

1725.919 --> 1738.7990000000002
like these people have no

1728.96 --> 1741.52
idea what they just stepped into

1738.799 --> 1743.76
and there's so many of them so many

1741.52 --> 1745.84
right the propaganda has worked they

1743.76 --> 1748.48
have bought the spell

1745.84 --> 1748.9599999999998
even though they should have known that

1748.48 --> 1752.0
it is

1748.96 --> 1754.24
all coming from people that do not

1752.0 --> 1755.2
have their best interests at heart that

1754.24 --> 1758.3990000000001
are like

1755.2 --> 1764.32
provably lying

1758.399 --> 1764.32
and the people they let it slip through

1764.399 --> 1771.279
and they're now in the trap

1767.679 --> 1772.88
and the trap is so big and potentially

1771.279 --> 1776.559
bad that people don't

1772.88 --> 1778.72
even know how bad it's gonna turn out to

1776.559 --> 1778.72
be

1778.84 --> 1781.84
right

1783.36 --> 1786.9599999999998
this vaccine is not a vaccine right

1785.6 --> 1791.039
right

1786.96 --> 1792.3990000000001
yeah well as soon as you try to begin to

1791.039 --> 1795.84
talk about this

1792.399 --> 1798.399
like half a year ago i could

1795.84 --> 1798.9599999999998
actually bring this up i could bring it

1798.399 --> 1802.32
up like

1798.96 --> 1806.72
ah this is not good people would listen

1802.32 --> 1808.8799999999999
it seems now that the trap is closing

1806.72 --> 1810.799
because people don't want to hear it

1808.88 --> 1812.5590000000002
anymore when you tell them it's not a

1810.799 --> 1814.399
vaccine it's a gene therapy it's not

1812.559 --> 1815.12
even claimed to affect the covet

1814.399 --> 1817.279
condition

1815.12 --> 1819.36
oh yeah wait there is no virus it's

1817.279 --> 1822.32
actually a condition formerly known

1819.36 --> 1824.6399999999999
as a cold and the flu of which there are

1822.32 --> 1826.48
no official cases registered anymore

1824.64 --> 1830.24
anywhere

1826.48 --> 1834.24
right when you say this now

1830.24 --> 1837.44
people are offended offended

1834.24 --> 1841.36
that you share this officially

1837.44 --> 1841.3600000000001
recognized information

1843.76 --> 1849.6
right because the propaganda

1847.039 --> 1851.039
still echoes the baseline [ __ ]

1849.6 --> 1853.039
manipulation

1851.039 --> 1854.1589999999999
but when you actually inquire there's

1853.039 --> 1856.32
quite a lot of people

1854.159 --> 1858.0
even in the system that just know like

1856.32 --> 1861.76
this is not good

1858.0 --> 1865.6
this is wrong we shouldn't be doing this

1861.76 --> 1867.919
plenty of articles people in all places

1865.6 --> 1868.6399999999999
the medical system in governments just

1867.919 --> 1871.679
stepping up

1868.64 --> 1872.3200000000002
like this is bad news we shouldn't be

1871.679 --> 1875.679
doing this

1872.32 --> 1877.9189999999999
or even like this is just this is

1875.679 --> 1880.5590000000002
genocide this is but this is potential

1877.919 --> 1880.5590000000002
genocide

1881.12 --> 1884.399
and people that are actual experts

1883.679 --> 1887.519
actual

1884.399 --> 1888.6399999999999
experts not just talking heads spouting

1887.519 --> 1890.48
out propaganda

1888.64 --> 1892.3200000000002
right they got things to lose when they

1890.48 --> 1894.24
do this and yet

1892.32 --> 1897.519
that is still happening and what's

1894.24 --> 1900.559
despite all of that people

1897.519 --> 1904.64
that are going with the whole

1900.559 --> 1906.72
rollout they'll be offended

1904.64 --> 1909.2
when you tell them the vaccine's not

1906.72 --> 1912.96
actually classified a vaccine and that

1909.2 --> 1915.76
all that they'll be offended now

1912.96 --> 1916.3990000000001
because they don't want to hear about

1915.76 --> 1919.039
the trap

1916.399 --> 1919.6
anymore they're in the trap they're

1919.039 --> 1922.8799999999999
going

1919.6 --> 1925.039
on a journey towards death one

1922.88 --> 1925.919
way or the other it's going to go there

1925.039 --> 1927.84
it's going to be

1925.919 --> 1930.72
absolutely miserable and they're not

1927.84 --> 1934.0
going to be helped

1930.72 --> 1938.48
and it's so bad that people don't want

1934.0 --> 1940.799
to know that it's actually real anymore

1938.48 --> 1941.6
it's gone to that point this is

1940.799 --> 1944.799
literally

1941.6 --> 1949.76
like one step away from complete

1944.799 --> 1954.0
civilization chaos breakdown

1949.76 --> 1954.0
it's already there so

1955.279 --> 1962.72
one push one tightening up one

1958.64 --> 1965.1200000000001
unexpected thing and then forcefully

1962.72 --> 1966.0
move people out of that dream it's gonna

1965.12 --> 1969.12
be [ __ ]

1966.0 --> 1972.159
chaos people like

1969.12 --> 1975.84
total chaos

1972.159 --> 1976.5590000000002
as in everything's gonna be just broken

1975.84 --> 1979.6789999999999
down

1976.559 --> 1984.6399999999999
like business food

1979.679 --> 1984.64
supplies everything

1986.0 --> 1990.799
one little push and it's literally just

1988.96 --> 1992.48
gonna collapse like a house of cards at

1990.799 --> 1996.96
this point

1992.48 --> 1996.96
this is really really bad news

1997.12 --> 2005.84
except for those that kind of have been

1999.2 --> 2005.8400000000001
preparing for this for a long long time

2008.399 --> 2011.6
but even for them because they're going

2010.24 --> 2014.64
to have to deal with

2011.6 --> 2018.0
just the overall demoralization

2014.64 --> 2023.6000000000001
like the zooming demoralized spirit of

2018.0 --> 2023.6
just millions of people everywhere

2024.159 --> 2029.279
realizing what has actually happened and

2026.559 --> 2029.279
what they did

2031.44 --> 2036.72
that's right and i'm worried about this

2038.399 --> 2042.6399999999999
hello chaminator and tom

2044.84 --> 2048.5589999999997
moyer

2046.08 --> 2048.5589999999997

and also nathan oakley by the way good

2057.04 --> 2061.839
good to see you

2067.04 --> 2072.839
all right was there going to be a live

2070.72 --> 2075.839
ball busters this evening i thought so

right

2102.24 --> 2108.64
aries starkwin has had some great

2105.52 --> 2108.64
one-liners what

2110.48 --> 2119.599
what the hell is this

2116.64 --> 2119.5989999999997
what do you mean nathan

2122.0 --> 2133.44
what are my grade one liners

2131.44 --> 2134.88
i mean i do my best constantly the

2133.44 --> 2137.92
problem is

2134.88 --> 2142.0
is i'm so busy just

2137.92 --> 2143.119
doing what i do that sometimes i have a

2142.0 --> 2144.8
whole bunch of

2143.119 --> 2148.4
things that roll out of me that sound

2144.8 --> 2148.4
pretty good and then

2148.56 --> 2153.44
all right yeah you know there's

2151.04 --> 2156.48
terrestrial refraction when it looks

2153.44 --> 2158.48
so flat yeah yeah i almost that's thank

2156.48 --> 2160.32
you for reminder that's a great title

2158.48 --> 2173.839
for today's show

2160.32 --> 2173.839
definitely gonna

2182.4 --> 2186.4
yeah thanks for reminding me definitely

2185.359 --> 2201.839
worth

2186.4 --> 2201.839
putting in a title

2204.24 --> 2208.24
all right globers want the earth to be a

2206.56 --> 2211.04
sphere they just don't want the

2208.24 --> 2215.839
consequences of it being a sphere yeah

2211.04 --> 2215.839
did i say that huh

2218.079 --> 2222.0
yeah i did it

2222.32 --> 2225.52
look these things just come rolling out

2224.64 --> 2228.16
of me

2225.52 --> 2230.16
even when i actually in the moment feel

2228.16 --> 2230.56
kind of [ __ ] about myself and then this

2230.16 --> 2233.52
thing

2230.56 --> 2236.4
comes rolling out then i kind of like

2233.52 --> 2236.4
forget about it

2238.0 --> 2243.839
but yeah that was a good one thanks for

2241.28 --> 2243.8390000000004
reminding me

2244.64 --> 2252.16
that that's good that's good for me

2248.88 --> 2256.32
good for my self-esteem because i don't

2252.16 --> 2259.2
feel all that great about myself overall

2256.32 --> 2259.2000000000003
you all know that

2262.64 --> 2270.24
i used it in the as the opening in one

2264.8 --> 2272.6400000000003
of my videos

2270.24 --> 2275.5989999999997
thank you nathan i i seriously

2272.64 --> 2275.5989999999997
appreciate that

2277.839 --> 2286.32
right and yes you can you can use

2283.2 --> 2288.96
you can use my my remarks

2286.32 --> 2288.96
these things

2292.24 --> 2296.0
like all of these things that i say are

2295.28 --> 2300.32
kind of

2296.0 --> 2302.64
i'm say them to make to make memes

2300.32 --> 2305.119
and although i would love like credit

2302.64 --> 2305.1189999999997
for it

2305.839 --> 2310.7999999999997
the the greatest honor is that they

2307.68 --> 2310.7999999999997
would spread her eye

2310.839 --> 2315.2799999999997
around

2312.16 --> 2315.2799999999997
it wow dude

2324.64 --> 2331.44
oh i think it's that that same guy that

2328.72 --> 2333.7599999999998
really doesn't want nathan and me to be

2331.44 --> 2333.76
friends

2334.8 --> 2339.119
he really doesn't like it he likes it so

2337.839 --> 2343.119
much that he can't

2339.119 --> 2346.56
actually even stop himself

2343.119 --> 2346.56
from just harassing me

2349.92 --> 2353.28
can't credit you more than publish you

2352.0 --> 2358.72
actually saying it

2353.28 --> 2358.7200000000003
right that's that's okay man

2362.96 --> 2367.68
but seriously thank you very much it's

2365.68 --> 2371.2799999999997
it's a real comfort

2367.68 --> 2371.68
because i don't know man these last few

2371.28 --> 2375.52
days

2371.68 --> 2378.64
i'm not feeling all that great it's

2375.52 --> 2381.44
swinging up the pendulum

2378.64 --> 2382.0789999999997
i get like that sometimes usually it

2381.44 --> 2386.88
happens

2382.079 --> 2386.88
at least once somewhere during spring

2387.839 --> 2391.92
where i just kind of like start to

2389.76 --> 2395.599
notice how freaking isolated i

2391.92 --> 2397.52
am right

2395.599 --> 2399.6800000000003
because there's just not a lot of people

2397.52 --> 2401.7599999999998
that i easily connect to even though

2399.68 --> 2403.2799999999997
when i look out there's well there's

2401.76 --> 2405.3590000000004
still plenty of people that do

2403.28 --> 2406.96
although it's starting to stand out to

2405.359 --> 2409.2799999999997
me that

2406.96 --> 2410.4
the overall connectivity out there is

2409.28 --> 2414.2400000000002
less

2410.4 --> 2414.2400000000002
than it was like two years ago

2422.839 --> 2425.839
right

2436.839 --> 2442.0789999999997
so

2438.319 --> 2447.2
ah double hidden it actually didn't

2442.079 --> 2447.2000000000003
hide and hide huh that's interesting

2450.24 --> 2453.839
i find weather can affect me

2453.92 --> 2458.96
winter spring the most right

2460.72 --> 2466.7999999999997
well during the winter

2464.0 --> 2470.16
what affects me is realizing that the

2466.8 --> 2473.2000000000003
light is retracting

2470.16 --> 2474.1189999999997
because i i kind of need the light i'm

2473.2 --> 2477.2799999999997
very

2474.119 --> 2480.1600000000003
photosensitive i need it

2477.28 --> 2482.1600000000003
i do take vitamin d3 and k2 and all that

2480.16 --> 2485.44
to kind of like compensate

2482.16 --> 2486.24
in the winter especially but during the

2485.44 --> 2489.119
spring

2486.24 --> 2491.1189999999997
it's different during the spring i often

2489.119 --> 2495.44
just

2491.119 --> 2498.079
feel alone because i'm not like this

2495.44 --> 2500.319
typical guy that's always hanging around

2498.079 --> 2502.0
easy to connect with all that right so

2500.319 --> 2504.8
then i just feel like ah

2502.0 --> 2506.56
damn it i'm such a such a freaking

2504.8 --> 2508.319
hermit

2506.56 --> 2510.0
and then i remember oh wait but i got a

2508.319 --> 2513.44
whole bunch of people here online

2510.0 --> 2514.4
so at least i'm not literally totally

2513.44 --> 2517.92
alone

2514.4 --> 2523.2000000000003
can you imagine me being me

2517.92 --> 2526.48
before i got into all this

2523.2 --> 2529.839
it was worse guys i felt like really

2526.48 --> 2531.359
[ __ ] up alone like a depression from

2529.839 --> 2538.16
which you kind of can't escape

2531.359 --> 2538.16
type of sensation it's better now right

2542.0 --> 2554.4
hey clutch bear by the way

2551.599 --> 2555.6800000000003
all right so yeah i'm just really happy

2554.4 --> 2559.6800000000003
that i got

2555.68 --> 2559.68
people here online that are

2561.04 --> 2566.48
well yeah you guys are friends

2564.72 --> 2568.0
that we do get to know each other even

2566.48 --> 2570.319
though it's through the digital

2568.0 --> 2570.319
realm

2571.76 --> 2576.96
what type of gene therapy is this

2573.76 --> 2578.6400000000003
vaccine uh it alters a specific protein

2576.96 --> 2581.359
production

2578.64 --> 2583.44
it replaces the protein production with

2581.359 --> 2585.5989999999997
another protein production that's not

2583.44 --> 2589.119
very good for you

2585.599 --> 2591.2000000000003
this protein typically destroys the

2589.119 --> 2594.7200000000003
placenta

2591.2 --> 2598.64
so it in women it typically can cause

2594.72 --> 2600.24
like permanent uh well

2598.64 --> 2601.7599999999998
that you literally just can't have a

2600.24 --> 2603.359
baby anymore because it's gonna turn

2601.76 --> 2606.8
into a miscarriage

2603.359 --> 2609.2799999999997
every single time it's terrible right

2606.8 --> 2610.96
terrible if you're if you want to have

2609.28 --> 2612.96
kids as a woman

2610.96 --> 2614.56
or even if you don't just don't freaking

2612.96 --> 2618.8
take it it's

2614.56 --> 2622.48
it's gonna mess you up mentally

2618.8 --> 2625.92
really bad right

2622.48 --> 2628.2400000000002
and also

2625.92 --> 2628.96
the type of protein it produces

2628.24 --> 2632.3999999999996
typically

2628.96 --> 2634.88
causes alzheimer it's directly

2632.4 --> 2638.7200000000003
associated with alzheimer's so that type

2634.88 --> 2641.92
of protein typically builds up plaque

2638.72 --> 2645.2
which causes alzheimer right

2641.92 --> 2645.839
it's not a good gene therapy it's very

2645.2 --> 2649.1189999999997
bad

2645.839 --> 2653.119
gene therapy very very bad there is

2649.119 --> 2655.119
no positive outcome the only positive

2653.119 --> 2656.2400000000002
outcome is that you either just never

2655.119 --> 2659.04
take it

2656.24 --> 2660.319
or that you some how that your body

2659.04 --> 2663.68
manages to

2660.319 --> 2666.88
make it not settle

2663.68 --> 2670.64
that it'll get rid of the tissue that

2666.88 --> 2670.6400000000003
actually starts to produce these

2674.839 --> 2677.839
proteins

2679.2 --> 2685.2
yes they have been working on this

2680.72 --> 2685.2
vaccine for for almost a decade i know

2686.079 --> 2690.2400000000002
you have to take one every three months

2687.76 --> 2691.119
but that's that's ridiculous that's

2690.24 --> 2693.4399999999996
guaranteed

2691.119 --> 2693.44
death

2696.079 --> 2699.599
like at some point the body's just gonna

2698.0 --> 2701.44
collapse under it even if you are

2699.599 --> 2703.76
supposedly healthy

2701.44 --> 2705.76
because that protein production every

2703.76 --> 2707.92
time you take it it's going to get worse

2705.76 --> 2710.48
and at some point it's just going to

2707.92 --> 2719.839
destroy the metabolism

2710.48 --> 2719.839
it's going to mess you up

2720.96 --> 2724.64
there's getting crazy out there you know

2723.839 --> 2727.68
there's people

2724.64 --> 2731.04
there's articles out there

2727.68 --> 2732.48
of people that actually take that

2731.04 --> 2735.599
vaccine

2732.48 --> 2737.52
to try and demonstrate to their family

2735.599 --> 2740.88
that it's not harmful

2737.52 --> 2744.079
and then they die right

2740.88 --> 2746.8
this is starting to happen out there

2744.079 --> 2747.52
people that are so into the dream so

2746.8 --> 2750.7200000000003
submerged

2747.52 --> 2752.56
so in magical thinking belief

2750.72 --> 2754.56
that it's good and if you just believe

2752.56 --> 2757.599
it's good then nothing will happen

2754.56 --> 2758.56
that are actually dying to try and take

2757.599 --> 2761.839
away

2758.56 --> 2775.839
the fears with their own family

2761.839 --> 2775.839
it's totally insane

2776.4 --> 2778.8
all right

2782.4 --> 2789.839
it's really crazy guys

2828.839 --> 2832.56
hmm white dove

2833.359 --> 2836.64
there's like a white dove couple out

2835.28 --> 2839.8390000000004
there

2836.64 --> 2845.839
that comes here before the water

2839.839 --> 2845.839
see isn't that cute

2856.839 --> 2862.77
mm-hmm

2859.64 --> 2862.77
[Music]

2877.359 --> 2882.0789999999997
i don't think the first vaccines have

2879.119 --> 2882.079
been are you kidding me

2882.24 --> 2886.0
are you kidding me serious they do have

2884.64 --> 2888.96
a huge impact there's

2886.0 --> 2892.16
literally people dying from them and

2888.96 --> 2892.16
those that survive

2892.8 --> 2900.2400000000002
like there is a guaranteed

2897.119 --> 2903.359
long-term negative effect because of the

2900.24 --> 2908.0789999999997
nature of what they actually do

2903.359 --> 2913.2
the protein alteration right

2908.079 --> 2916.88
it's not it's not a minor impact

2913.2 --> 2919.7599999999998
the first wave is devastating

2916.88 --> 2919.76
devastating

2921.04 --> 2925.68
like every freaking nurse that's gonna

2924.559 --> 2928.3190000000004
take it like every

2925.68 --> 2930.8799999999997
female nurse that's going to be forced

2928.319 --> 2933.44
to take this somehow

2930.88 --> 2935.92
they're never having kids again do you

2933.44 --> 2935.92
understand

2937.44 --> 2944.16
it's impossible do you know

2940.96 --> 2946.96
how many women that is

2944.16 --> 2946.96
worldwide

2949.2 --> 2957.839
it's it's not minor it's

2952.72 --> 2957.839
devastating unheard of

2957.92 --> 2964.88
like this is work this is much

2960.96 --> 2967.52
much worse than the whole situation with

2964.88 --> 2971.04
the spanish flu

2967.52 --> 2974.72
100 years ago much

2971.04 --> 2978.16
much worse we don't

2974.72 --> 2980.7999999999997
really know yet yeah you do

2978.16 --> 2980.7999999999997
yes you do

2981.839 --> 2988.72
the protein produced

2985.599 --> 2992.0
in the body by the genetic

2988.72 --> 2995.2
alteration literally

2992.0 --> 2997.599
causes place it attacks placenta

2995.2 --> 3000.7999999999997
which means that every woman that takes

2997.599 --> 3003.6800000000003
it that tries to gets a baby

3000.8 --> 3004.48
they're all going to have miscarriages

3003.68 --> 3007.04
right

3004.48 --> 3007.04
all of them

3010.96 --> 3013.839
we do know

3029.96 --> 3033.389
[Music]

3052.839 --> 3059.2799999999997
right

3055.44 --> 3059.28
hello jado by the way

3059.599 --> 3069.6800000000003
i know it's a lie what

3062.72 --> 3074.64
i don't know what you're talking about

3069.68 --> 3082.48
well yeah clutch bear that's a terribly

3074.64 --> 3084.0789999999997
accurate comparison yeah and people

3082.48 --> 3087.76
don't seem to realize

3084.079 --> 3092.88
like this is not a potential

3087.76 --> 3092.88
outcome this is gonna happen

3093.119 --> 3100.1600000000003
right it's already done the damage

3097.52 --> 3103.68
right now even if like suddenly there

3100.16 --> 3106.5589999999997
would be a giant outburst like literally

3103.68 --> 3108.7999999999997
mega corporations that deal with these

3106.559 --> 3109.119
vaccines are getting arrested and it's

3108.8 --> 3112.4
like

3109.119 --> 3113.04
forbidden to take it right there's

3112.4 --> 3116.8
already

3113.04 --> 3119.68
enough damage done it's already

3116.8 --> 3119.6800000000003
really bad

3121.04 --> 3125.839
there's already too many people having

3122.96 --> 3125.839
taken it

3140.16 --> 3146.0
yeah it

3143.68 --> 3147.52
yeah that wow good servant that's messed

3146.0 --> 3152.319
up everybody except

3147.52 --> 3155.28
oh [ __ ] them like seriously

3152.319 --> 3156.16
yeah like let them all take it and die

3155.28 --> 3161.0400000000004
don't take it

3156.16 --> 3161.04
no matter what no matter what don't do

3164.839 --> 3167.839
it

3178.839 --> 3181.839
so

3183.599 --> 3187.2000000000003
yeah spanish flu popped up when america

3185.68 --> 3188.8799999999997
went live with the worldwide radio

3187.2 --> 3192.0
system yeah

3188.88 --> 3192.6400000000003
that and there was a vaccine situation

3192.0 --> 3195.2
as well

3192.64 --> 3196.96
like the whole spanish flu situation was

3195.2 --> 3199.2
a combined

3196.96 --> 3199.2
thing

3206.48 --> 3212.72
right yes jedo yeah that is right don't

3209.359 --> 3212.72
take it no matter what

3212.8 --> 3216.319
defend your position of not taking it

3215.76 --> 3219.8390000000004
with

3216.319 --> 3223.119
your life it's better

3219.839 --> 3228.0789999999997
to literally become a bum

3223.119 --> 3232.8
than taking the [ __ ] vaccine it is

3228.079 --> 3232.8
better to end up whatever like

3233.2 --> 3238.7999999999997
just don't take it no matter what no

3236.0 --> 3238.8
matter what

3238.88 --> 3243.599
defend yourself with violence if you

3241.119 --> 3243.599
have to

3243.839 --> 3251.839
no matter what

3263.359 --> 3267.2799999999997
wow nathan or that's messed up man i

3265.52 --> 3270.4
didn't i didn't know

3267.28 --> 3273.8390000000004
but yeah i'm not surprised

3270.4 --> 3276.7200000000003
this is not the first time right look

3273.839 --> 3276.72
vaccination

3277.52 --> 3284.0
the industries right not just the basic

3280.72 --> 3287.1189999999997
childhood disease vaccines

3284.0 --> 3290.96
but just the vaccination industry

3287.119 --> 3294.92
seems to be a worldwide

3290.96 --> 3298.079
eugenics system is it seems to be there

3294.92 --> 3299.359
specifically to call and mutilate

3298.079 --> 3301.52
populations

3299.359 --> 3302.4
and to experiment with them it seems

3301.52 --> 3306.64
like it was

3302.4 --> 3310.319
specifically erected

3306.64 --> 3313.68
in the worldwide system only for that

3310.319 --> 3317.2
only it's the only reason it exists

3313.68 --> 3321.839
is to call and mutilate the population

3317.2 --> 3324.72
it's the only reason it exists

3321.839 --> 3325.68
if you can prove the contrary i'd like

3324.72 --> 3328.16
to hear it

3325.68 --> 3330.319
right because i'm not talking about like

3328.16 --> 3333.2
childhood disease vaccines and all that

3330.319 --> 3336.5589999999997
they're really really basic things

3333.2 --> 3339.2799999999997
i'm talking about everything else flu

3336.559 --> 3339.28
vaccines

3339.839 --> 3349.839
usually any vaccine relating to viruses

3343.28 --> 3349.8390000000004
presumed to be viruses in any way

3350.559 --> 3357.599
if you can find like history rollout of

3353.599 --> 3359.92
any virus related vaccine

3357.599 --> 3361.28
in the last hundred years that did not

3359.92 --> 3365.6800000000003
lead to just

3361.28 --> 3376.7200000000003
massive damage and death at any point

3365.68 --> 3380.3999999999996
i'd like to hear about it

3376.72 --> 3380.3999999999996
oh good servant then don't take it

3381.2 --> 3384.72
just don't take it defend it defend not

3384.079 --> 3387.8390000000004
taking it

3384.72 --> 3389.04
with your life just tell them like i'm

3387.839 --> 3392.16
not taking it under

3389.04 --> 3405.839
any condition any condition never

3392.16 --> 3405.839
ever i will die first

3408.16 --> 3412.48
all right well okay akuma virus

3415.52 --> 3421.2
that's pretty bizarre

3418.88 --> 3422.079
so if she if your mother got polio from

3421.2 --> 3425.1189999999997
the vaccine

3422.079 --> 3430.4
why did she and your sister

3425.119 --> 3430.4
take this thing she should be knowing

3430.839 --> 3433.839
better

3434.96 --> 3438.4
they should be knowing better but

3436.88 --> 3440.96
especially your mother if you already

3438.4 --> 3443.44
got the freaking polio from that vaccine

3440.96 --> 3443.44
that's just

3444.839 --> 3447.839
crazy

3455.76 --> 3459.599
okay well hey if you think that's a

3457.68 --> 3462.96
laughing matter

3459.599 --> 3464.559
dude it's your freaking family you think

3462.96 --> 3466.0
that's a laughing matter it's your

3464.559 --> 3475.8390000000004
family

3466.0 --> 3475.839
not mine

3481.28 --> 3485.2000000000003
if you think vaccines were ever good or

3484.24 --> 3489.04
safe

3485.2 --> 3492.72
you just don't get it well yeah

3489.04 --> 3495.119
i think that for most most vaccines

3492.72 --> 3497.2
it is ridiculous but still childhood

3495.119 --> 3501.119
disease vaccines

3497.2 --> 3503.52
there is an argument for it right

3501.119 --> 3505.28
but there's also even arguments against

3503.52 --> 3508.799
that

3505.28 --> 3512.4
i'm just not willing to go that last

3508.799 --> 3514.839
step and just completely say no

3512.4 --> 3516.559
like every form of vaccine should be

3514.839 --> 3518.5589999999997
illegal

3516.559 --> 3520.48
i'm not going there i'm not going to be

3518.559 --> 3521.92
like a full-fledged hundred percent

3520.48 --> 3526.319
anti-vaxxer

3521.92 --> 3529.6800000000003
i just want these eugenics operations

3526.319 --> 3532.88
to stop and i want the mega

3529.68 --> 3538.72
industrial medical complexes

3532.88 --> 3541.839
to basically yeah to cease to exist

3538.72 --> 3544.48
that's what i want but hey

3541.839 --> 3545.839
if after that point people still want to

3544.48 --> 3550.16
apply

3545.839 --> 3554.16
old-fashioned proven vaccines

3550.16 --> 3554.16
then why would you forbid that

3556.839 --> 3559.839
right

3570.839 --> 3573.839
so

3577.52 --> 3583.92
right nathan r and science ooh

3580.799 --> 3586.64
be careful about that but yes

3583.92 --> 3588.48
yes i'm like that too i don't like faxes

3586.64 --> 3590.319
i don't want faxes i don't

3588.48 --> 3593.52
want if if i'm ever going to have

3590.319 --> 3595.92
children if that's still an option

3593.52 --> 3597.92
in a few years there are there are going

3595.92 --> 3600.559
to be any women left

3597.92 --> 3602.319
that can even have kids that if i'm

3600.559 --> 3604.1600000000003
gonna have kids i'm never gonna give

3602.319 --> 3606.72
them a vaccine

3604.16 --> 3607.5989999999997
like not in this freaking world man i'm

3606.72 --> 3611.52
not doing it

3607.599 --> 3615.119
i'm not doing it this world is so

3611.52 --> 3617.119
[ __ ] so untrustworthy i'm not even

3615.119 --> 3618.559
gonna risk getting a basic vaccine

3617.119 --> 3620.88
because it just can't trust

3618.559 --> 3622.2400000000002
anything from this medical system

3620.88 --> 3626.48
anymore anything

3622.24 --> 3629.52
nothing as far as i'm concerned

3626.48 --> 3633.04
should all be burned down like burned

3629.52 --> 3633.839
down right we don't need any of it

3633.04 --> 3637.839
anymore

3633.839 --> 3637.839
you can't trust any of it anyway

3639.28 --> 3642.48
but yeah it sounds a little exaggerated

3641.68 --> 3644.72
maybe

3642.48 --> 3645.76
but that's how i feel like it like it's

3644.72 --> 3649.5989999999997
corrupted

3645.76 --> 3650.2400000000002
so bad there is no logical reason to

3649.599 --> 3655.52
trust

3650.24 --> 3659.9199999999996
any of it anymore like maybe in 50 years

3655.52 --> 3663.119
when like the last of the deed safeters

3659.92 --> 3666.319
have been executed like

3663.119 --> 3669.44
every single one of them right

3666.319 --> 3674.079
when it's when it's over when that is

3669.44 --> 3674.079
really over then sure

3675.839 --> 3682.799
and who knows i might even find some

3678.88 --> 3683.2000000000003
doctors that have been self-educated

3682.799 --> 3685.04
that

3683.2 --> 3686.5589999999997
have figured out it's all messed up that

3685.04 --> 3688.079
are not doing it for the money they're

3686.559 --> 3692.1600000000003
doing it actually for their

3688.079 --> 3694.6400000000003
hippocratic oath like doctor should

3692.16 --> 3696.5589999999997
then yeah i'll i'll take their advice

3694.64 --> 3697.04
under consideration i might even let

3696.559 --> 3700.079
them

3697.04 --> 3703.2799999999997
who knows operate on me or something

3700.079 --> 3706.4
if i thought it was necessary

3703.28 --> 3709.119
but the system no way

3706.4 --> 3710.559
i don't want to have anything to do with

3709.119 --> 3714.319
it anymore

3710.559 --> 3718.0
nothing it can literally burn down

3714.319 --> 3720.799
i don't give a [ __ ] i want

3718.0 --> 3723.2
nothing to do with this medical system

3720.799 --> 3723.2
anymore

3724.839 --> 3727.839
nothing

3738.839 --> 3742.64
hmm whoa

3740.4 --> 3743.76
couldn't move your arm for six months

3742.64 --> 3747.5989999999997
after a flu shot

3743.76 --> 3747.599
geez six months that's crazy

3747.68 --> 3753.44
but yeah that'll sure make you think

3750.079 --> 3755.44
twice for doing it again i can imagine

3753.44 --> 3757.839
i'm glad you didn't get anything worse

3755.44 --> 3757.839
from it

3758.48 --> 3769.839
at least you were able to move your arm

3760.4 --> 3769.839
again after six months

3781.92 --> 3787.599
right classical homeopath

3785.28 --> 3789.599
yeah i and i did get a couple of

3787.599 --> 3792.1600000000003
vaccines when i was a kid

3789.599 --> 3793.92
but it was like the most basic of basics

3792.16 --> 3795.68
and i think that i did get a bad

3793.92 --> 3798.4
response from them i think that i might

3795.68 --> 3801.44
have actually had this weird

3798.4 --> 3802.559
character development or rather

3801.44 --> 3805.599
underdevelopment

3802.559 --> 3808.4
my social underdevelopment

3805.599 --> 3810.96
because yeah i have the sensitivity i

3808.4 --> 3813.96
can study people i can figure out

3810.96 --> 3816.559
things in them but just natural

3813.96 --> 3818.559
socialization

3816.559 --> 3820.6400000000003
i'm not good at that i've never been

3818.559 --> 3824.4
good at it like ever

3820.64 --> 3826.8799999999997
and it's way late for any of it

3824.4 --> 3829.119
to really point fingers but i have

3826.88 --> 3831.6800000000003
suspected that it might actually have

3829.119 --> 3832.6400000000003
to do with those original vaccines that

3831.68 --> 3835.68
i took

3832.64 --> 3838.0789999999997
and that my parents even knew that

3835.68 --> 3840.64
and then chose to not give me any more

3838.079 --> 3841.8390000000004
vaccines even though i didn't know i was

3840.64 --> 3844.24
like no of course

3841.839 --> 3845.119
i want a vaccine it's good for me i was

3844.24 --> 3848.16
like i was

3845.119 --> 3851.839
god oh i hate that

3848.16 --> 3852.799
it was so trusting as a kid it's

3851.839 --> 3856.0789999999997
terrible

3852.799 --> 3858.88
it's it's sometimes i really think it's

3856.079 --> 3861.7200000000003
a miracle i even survived

3858.88 --> 3862.96
it's really literally i was such a

3861.72 --> 3866.0789999999997
stupid

3862.96 --> 3868.96
system [ __ ] so

3866.079 --> 3871.28
terrible i hate it i hate that i have

3868.96 --> 3874.48
that in my nature

3871.28 --> 3877.3590000000004
that i had that it sucks

3874.48 --> 3878.88
it sucks that you'll just be like i am a

3877.359 --> 3883.119
soldier for

3878.88 --> 3886.88
the country i will do anything for you

3883.119 --> 3889.6800000000003
anything just fully trusting it all it's

3886.88 --> 3892.079
so terrible to be like that in this

3889.68 --> 3892.0789999999997
world

3892.839 --> 3895.839
like

3898.4 --> 3905.52
but it's like this blind love right

3902.559 --> 3906.3190000000004
it's it's very tough to stop and i think

3905.52 --> 3909.52
that maybe

3906.319 --> 3912.24
the same issue is what

3909.52 --> 3913.52
is making people just go with the corona

3912.24 --> 3916.5589999999997
vaccine

3913.52 --> 3920.0
and like blind trusts because of

3916.559 --> 3922.079
love for society because

3920.0 --> 3923.599
because they're that stupid because

3922.079 --> 3926.1600000000003
they're stupid

3923.599 --> 3927.52
in the way that i was stupid as a little

3926.16 --> 3930.24
kid

3927.52 --> 3930.64
and as a little kid i was really smart

3930.24 --> 3934.0789999999997
right

3930.64 --> 3937.5989999999997
when i was five i was really

3934.079 --> 3941.039
freaking smart really smart

3937.599 --> 3945.039
yet i would literally surrender

3941.039 --> 3950.3590000000004
to maniacs because of my

3945.039 --> 3953.44
blind zealous

3950.359 --> 3955.92
surrenderism to be like a soldier

3953.44 --> 3957.52
of everything and everybody right i

3955.92 --> 3960.7200000000003
would just had that dream

3957.52 --> 3965.359
and it couldn't i couldn't get it out i

3960.72 --> 3968.8799999999997
couldn't i wanted it i wanted that

3965.359 --> 3971.52
i just wanted to be in an ideal world

3968.88 --> 3972.319
being a man being a soldier to defend

3971.52 --> 3974.559
everybody

3972.319 --> 3977.0389999999998
and everything must be good and i

3974.559 --> 3993.8390000000004
couldn't get it out

3977.039 --> 3993.8390000000004
it got me in so many problems

3998.16 --> 4010.48
destroyed my brachial plexus what's that

4007.2 --> 4014.64
right very trusting and it's terrible

4010.48 --> 4014.64
it's terrible that we have this

4017.839 --> 4021.2
yeah jesus warns us but if you're a

4020.0 --> 4026.4
freaking

4021.2 --> 4026.3999999999996
tiny little kid it doesn't help

4026.799 --> 4030.319
because you're just going to look to

4029.44 --> 4032.319
your peers

4030.319 --> 4034.72
and if your peers that includes your

4032.319 --> 4039.68
parents are just too weak

4034.72 --> 4043.4399999999996
to defend against all this

4039.68 --> 4045.2799999999997
you're [ __ ] if you don't have parents

4043.44 --> 4049.2000000000003
that literally tell you

4045.28 --> 4054.079
no don't do that

4049.2 --> 4058.0
they are evil if you surrender like this

4054.079 --> 4061.3590000000004
they're going to [ __ ] kill you

4058.0 --> 4065.119
right well it's unheard of like a kid

4061.359 --> 4069.24
now will just just go into total panic

4065.119 --> 4071.599
total panic because everything else

4069.24 --> 4073.0389999999998
indoctrinates them in exactly the

4071.599 --> 4076.079
opposite way

4073.039 --> 4080.48
the school indoctrination levels now

4076.079 --> 4083.3590000000004
is horrific it's inhumane

4080.48 --> 4083.76
levels of indoctrination where it's just

4083.359 --> 4086.24
like

4083.76 --> 4088.079
peop like even teachers and everyone's

4086.24 --> 4091.2
just afraid

4088.079 --> 4093.8390000000004
to even confront a kid with that they

4091.2 --> 4094.24
shouldn't actually trust the system

4093.839 --> 4096.48
because

4094.24 --> 4097.5199999999995
they are part of the system and even

4096.48 --> 4099.759
though they probably

4097.52 --> 4101.679
want to warn some of these kids like

4099.759 --> 4105.759
don't

4101.679 --> 4108.88
don't do that they're afraid

4105.759 --> 4112.159
that it they will be caught

4108.88 --> 4116.839
sowing rebellion against the beast and

4112.159 --> 4132.639999999999
and lose their position it's so

4116.839 --> 4135.12
[ __ ] so [ __ ]

4132.64 --> 4136.88
remember through the television all the

4135.12 --> 4139.12
indoctrination of all the

4136.88 --> 4140.719
all the christian parents all the

4139.12 --> 4144.08
strictness and

4140.719 --> 4145.199
of letting your child not do as they

4144.08 --> 4147.92
want

4145.199 --> 4150.3189999999995
and oh my god how can you punish your

4147.92 --> 4151.04
child for disobedience of the parents

4150.319 --> 4154.319
and

4151.04 --> 4155.44
like they totally [ __ ] every single

4154.319 --> 4158.4800000000005
mechanism

4155.44 --> 4162.0
that could actually help prevent

4158.48 --> 4162.879999999999
kids from becoming a beast surrenderers

4162.0 --> 4166.08
they

4162.88 --> 4169.679
they routed it out they

4166.08 --> 4171.759
routed it out of culture out of western

4169.679 --> 4175.839
culture they completely

4171.759 --> 4175.839
destroyed that

4176.799 --> 4184.0
and i even remember that i was

4180.199 --> 4187.04
indoctrinated by that i thought

4184.0 --> 4189.44
it was bad i thought that just

4187.04 --> 4190.48
letting your kid go and let them do

4189.44 --> 4196.08
whatever they want

4190.48 --> 4196.08
i thought that was good i thought it was

4200.84 --> 4203.84
good

4208.4 --> 4211.92
right and hey if you are like with your

4211.52 --> 4215.4400000000005
family

4211.92 --> 4217.28
you have a family and you're kind of in

4215.44 --> 4219.678999999999
the middle of nowhere

4217.28 --> 4220.639999999999
you make your own food you have like a

4219.679 --> 4223.76
farm set up

4220.64 --> 4223.76
and yeah then

4226.48 --> 4231.199
it's different because they're not

4229.12 --> 4234.4
constantly being confronted with an

4231.199 --> 4236.0
indoctrination system from the outside

4234.4 --> 4238.32
that you have to fight against and

4236.0 --> 4240.56
they'll be seeking for the parents like

4238.32 --> 4243.36
can you give me something to do what am

4240.56 --> 4247.4400000000005
i supposed to do in this life

4243.36 --> 4259.839999999999
give me a purpose

4247.44 --> 4259.839999999999
right and it works all different

4267.84 --> 4287.84
we're yet somehow we broke this belt

4303.6 --> 4306.88
i really needed to get that out for a

4305.52 --> 4309.360000000001
moment man it's

4306.88 --> 4312.84
it's weighing on me like this everything

4309.36 --> 4315.5199999999995
i pretty much said now in the last 15

4312.84 --> 4316.8
minutes that is really the thing that is

4315.52 --> 4321.280000000001
causing me like this

4316.8 --> 4321.28
emotionally messed up state

4323.04 --> 4329.76
because i just feel less

4326.4 --> 4332.4
to look forward to in the world because

4329.76 --> 4332.400000000001
of all this

4335.04 --> 4341.199
awaken the work i think you need some

4338.8 --> 4346.2390000000005
change for the good you know [ __ ]

4341.199 --> 4346.239
but what would that be awaken the woke

4346.48 --> 4349.28
can you tell me

4353.199 --> 4359.36
i was born awake i had figured out that

4355.679 --> 4362.719
four years old not many friends

4359.36 --> 4366.159
well i was born a sleeper i was born a

4362.719 --> 4369.199
communist soldier that was like

4366.159 --> 4372.639999999999
willing to do anything

4369.199 --> 4374.719
to gain some

4372.64 --> 4375.679
respect and leverage of control and i

4374.719 --> 4380.159
had no

4375.679 --> 4385.84
idea no idea that there was

4380.159 --> 4385.839999999999
no no viable thing there

4387.6 --> 4392.8
right and every time somebody kind of

4391.12 --> 4396.08
tried to remind me

4392.8 --> 4399.12
i would just shoot into like really bad

4396.08 --> 4402.48
depression moods

4399.12 --> 4406.08
where i literally just couldn't see

4402.48 --> 4409.678999999999
anything and like i they couldn't deal

4406.08 --> 4413.28
with reality i couldn't deal

4409.679 --> 4415.84
with reality at all

4413.28 --> 4415.84
i couldn't

4417.04 --> 4424.84
i couldn't look at the world and try to

4420.96 --> 4428.0
figure out a way through with who i

4424.84 --> 4431.12
am without

4428.0 --> 4432.719
without the dream to kind of like paste

4431.12 --> 4434.5599999999995
it over with some kind of

4432.719 --> 4438.2390000000005
stupid fantasy that could never come

4434.56 --> 4442.159000000001
true like i i couldn't do it

4438.239 --> 4444.32
and i in ways considerably

4442.159 --> 4447.839999999999
i have still have a lot of trouble with

4444.32 --> 4447.84
it but at least i'm trying

4448.239 --> 4454.48
right because now i get stuck in other

4450.08 --> 4456.96
dreams now i get stuck in the

4454.48 --> 4459.28
the awakening nightmares the nightmares

4456.96 --> 4461.84
that come with the awakening now

4459.28 --> 4462.8
it's that is staring me in the face now

4461.84 --> 4465.12
that thing that i

4462.8 --> 4466.320000000001
originally couldn't even recognize was

4465.12 --> 4469.44
true

4466.32 --> 4473.599999999999
is now in my way

4469.44 --> 4477.678999999999
and i can't get past it really

4473.6 --> 4481.04
i guess i might at moments

4477.679 --> 4484.56
i might but the world's just

4481.04 --> 4487.28
completely insane to me

4484.56 --> 4488.56
the way people are is completely insane

4487.28 --> 4491.28
to me

4488.56 --> 4492.88
like i see the vast majority of people

4491.28 --> 4497.679
are subconsciously

4492.88 --> 4501.36
suicidal right they're subconsciously

4497.679 --> 4504.64
suicidal and they're stuck in a dream

4501.36 --> 4511.839999999999
and they don't even know what it is that

4504.64 --> 4511.84
afflicts them

4522.0 --> 4529.44
oh man i've been going on

4525.199 --> 4529.44
a tangent for a while by the way since

4530.32 --> 4534.48
and i'm glad i can get this kind of off

4532.4 --> 4539.36
my chest for a bit

4534.48 --> 4542.879999999999
i think i might keep on going

4539.36 --> 4545.28
well maybe i'll just do two hours

4542.88 --> 4545.92
but i gotta take a two minute break

4545.28 --> 4553.84
though

4545.92 --> 4553.84
i'll be right back

4578.84 --> 4581.84
so

4634.84 --> 4637.84
so

4648.84 --> 4651.84
you

4656.239 --> 4667.678999999999
moving on up beans don't burn what

4959.12 --> 4961.36
huh

4966.0 --> 4972.48
spinoff from archie bunker oh okay

4970.239 --> 4974.0
i we do know archie bunker though that

4972.48 --> 4977.12
that has

4974.0 --> 4979.04
like played in the netherlands

4977.12 --> 4981.04
but that was also kind of like during

4979.04 --> 4987.84
the 80s

4981.04 --> 4987.84
but i've never heard of that spin-off

4998.84 --> 5001.84
hmm

5015.18 --> 5018.279
[Music]

5035.92 --> 5043.84
what right uh

5050.5 --> 5053.63
[Music]

5054.84 --> 5057.84
uh

5057.86 --> 5061.0
[Music]

5068.84 --> 5071.84
hmm

5078.88 --> 5085.84
what why are you seeing iron 26's

5082.4 --> 5085.839999999999
comment i don't oh there you go

5096.84 --> 5099.84
huh

5119.52 --> 5126.0
that's not how you spell thieves

5122.96 --> 5141.84
clutch bear this

5126.0 --> 5141.84
this is how you spell that

5147.92 --> 5151.28
your immune system no

5152.159 --> 5156.96
well classical homeopath that's not

5154.639 --> 5161.1990000000005
exactly how that works

5156.96 --> 5161.199
like if it's actual vaccination

5161.36 --> 5165.12
no it doesn't lower your immune system

5164.239 --> 5169.36
it shouldn't

5165.12 --> 5172.32
it just supposedly weakens

5169.36 --> 5172.32
the bacteria

5173.199 --> 5178.159
and then allows your body to adapt with

5176.159 --> 5180.32
its immune system it doesn't weaken your

5178.159 --> 5183.12
immune system because if it did that

5180.32 --> 5185.04
then yeah it's not going to produce the

5183.12 --> 5189.12
antibodies that's the whole point that's

5185.04 --> 5190.719
the actual mechanism of vaccination

5189.12 --> 5193.36
that's what it's supposed to do if it

5190.719 --> 5196.56
doesn't is not a vaccination

5193.36 --> 5199.92
right so but

5196.56 --> 5202.719
yes a lot of vaccinations does

5199.92 --> 5204.96
overall damage or weaken your immune

5202.719 --> 5207.36
system right that's why

5204.96 --> 5209.12
the idea that like a very little kid or

5207.36 --> 5212.4
even a baby should get like

5209.12 --> 5215.5199999999995
60 vaccinations one giant jab that's

5212.4 --> 5216.719
terrible because then it doesn't really

5215.52 --> 5219.360000000001
function anymore

5216.719 --> 5220.4800000000005
the way it's supposed to every

5219.36 --> 5223.679
vaccination

5220.48 --> 5226.5599999999995
should basically be taken separately

5223.679 --> 5228.56
to minimize the amount of adaptation

5226.56 --> 5239.84
your body needs to do and especially

5228.56 --> 5239.84
minimize the amount of poison

5251.199 --> 5255.12
any evidence of a molten iron core

5255.199 --> 5266.879999999999
uh joey through bolts

5258.239 --> 5269.04
i don't think so

5266.88 --> 5270.88
that's why you don't get colds when

5269.04 --> 5271.679
you're vaccinated because it destroys

5270.88 --> 5274.8
your immunity

5271.679 --> 5281.84
no no

5274.8 --> 5281.84
that's not true

5282.08 --> 5295.84
no if your immune system is weakened

5285.52 --> 5295.84
you get colds more

5296.56 --> 5300.400000000001
think though what you're talking about

5299.36 --> 5303.199
is rather a

5300.4 --> 5305.12
immune system response suppressive

5303.199 --> 5308.4
suppressed state

5305.12 --> 5309.76
that's different right it like the

5308.4 --> 5311.599999999999
immune system there is

5309.76 --> 5313.04
even like drugs and [ __ ] that it

5311.6 --> 5316.639
suppress it

5313.04 --> 5318.8
and then it can have a terrible effect

5316.639 --> 5319.92
because you might get infectious

5318.8 --> 5322.0
infections

5319.92 --> 5323.84
even like bacterial infections are in

5322.0 --> 5325.36
like a little wound or whatever

5323.84 --> 5327.12
and then your body's not going to do

5325.36 --> 5328.96
anything about it and then you know

5327.12 --> 5331.12
you're not getting diseased right but in

5328.96 --> 5332.8
the meantime you do get infected and

5331.12 --> 5334.96
then at some point it's going to

5332.8 --> 5337.84
overwhelm your system

5334.96 --> 5337.84
but that's different

5341.36 --> 5349.28
yeah but that's different right

5345.6 --> 5350.639
that's a different effect and that's not

5349.28 --> 5353.5199999999995
just

5350.639 --> 5355.1990000000005
get because getting a cold is your

5353.52 --> 5359.120000000001
immune system

5355.199 --> 5359.12
it's a cleanup process and all that

5360.639 --> 5366.32
but vaccinations don't standard wise

5364.32 --> 5368.48
take that out if it's an actual

5366.32 --> 5368.96
vaccination it shouldn't that makes no

5368.48 --> 5371.5199999999995
sense

5368.96 --> 5373.04
because the whole point is to trigger

5371.52 --> 5376.320000000001
the immune system to

5373.04 --> 5380.96
adapt to the bacteria

5376.32 --> 5384.32
to get that immune the immune response

5380.96 --> 5386.719
and have that in your blood that's the

5384.32 --> 5390.639
whole point of vaccination so if it

5386.719 --> 5392.4800000000005
it has immune suppressant then it will

5390.639 --> 5394.2390000000005
literally not function the way it's

5392.48 --> 5396.799999999999
designed to

5394.239 --> 5398.0
that makes no sense it's not a

5396.8 --> 5400.88
vaccination anymore

5398.0 --> 5401.76
it's something else not a vaccination

5400.88 --> 5404.2390000000005
because if it

5401.76 --> 5406.4800000000005
just suppresses the immune system then

5404.239 --> 5421.839999999999
you're not going to have the actual

5406.48 --> 5421.839999999999
effect that a vaccination is for

5438.0 --> 5440.239
what

5442.719 --> 5449.84
who what i don't know awaken the work i

5445.28 --> 5449.84
don't know who you are

5467.04 --> 5470.719
what what are you all talking about

5471.84 --> 5478.719
i don't think that's a real mechanism uh

5475.12 --> 5478.719
no that's official

5484.0 --> 5490.56
now as soon as there's any vaccination

5487.28 --> 5492.08
claims made about a virus though that's

5490.56 --> 5496.159000000001
where things get weird

5492.08 --> 5498.96
because you can't that's not possible

5496.159 --> 5499.36
you can't vaccinate against viruses

5498.96 --> 5504.96
because

5499.36 --> 5509.759999999999
viruses don't give an immune response

5504.96 --> 5512.0
they are the immune response

5509.76 --> 5513.76
it makes no sense you can't vaccinate

5512.0 --> 5519.84
against that it makes no

5513.76 --> 5519.84
literally no sense right

5519.92 --> 5526.8
but that's with viruses bacteria

5524.08 --> 5526.8
that's different

5530.84 --> 5533.84
right

5538.639 --> 5542.719
right okay well then we're on the same

5541.04 --> 5547.84
train of thought then

5542.719 --> 5547.84
glad to hear that

5553.28 --> 5560.96
yep that food be thy medicine

5556.96 --> 5564.4
barry davis indeed

5560.96 --> 5564.4
they're all microbes

5564.48 --> 5568.4
microbes what does that mean

5570.159 --> 5577.199
no viruses are exosomes and exosomes are

5574.159 --> 5580.159
produced in the body as a cleanup

5577.199 --> 5580.159
mechanism to

5580.4 --> 5587.679
rapidly clean up acute

5584.639 --> 5590.400000000001
poisoning that's when viruses come out

5587.679 --> 5592.639
that's when the viral response starts

5590.4 --> 5593.44
because it's exosomes they clean it up

5592.639 --> 5596.719
it's in

5593.44 --> 5598.96
the body you have viruses of all kinds

5596.719 --> 5601.52
in your body at all times you're born

5598.96 --> 5605.44
with it because it's body inherent

5601.52 --> 5609.52
there's virus supposed virus exosome

5605.44 --> 5612.638999999999
particles thingies

5609.52 --> 5615.679
protein thingies in your body

5612.639 --> 5619.4400000000005
at all times all times

5615.679 --> 5623.4400000000005
forever until you die all times

5619.44 --> 5627.199
always because it's produced in the body

5623.44 --> 5628.879999999999
it is part of the body it's supposed to

5627.199 --> 5632.4
be there

5628.88 --> 5645.84
it's not an infectious agent that's not

5632.4 --> 5645.839999999999
what they do

5656.84 --> 5660.88
right

5658.639 --> 5661.76
kind of similar case for bacteria well

5660.88 --> 5664.4800000000005
no

5661.76 --> 5667.04
not really there are just very hostile

5664.48 --> 5667.04
bacteria

5667.199 --> 5669.44
right

5670.719 --> 5674.96
and there's good bacteria too right it's

5672.8 --> 5677.12
not like all bacteria bad there's

5674.96 --> 5678.96
bacteria for every location there's

5677.12 --> 5680.96
special gut flora bacteria there's

5678.96 --> 5682.96
special bacteria for your skin that's

5680.96 --> 5684.8
really good for your skin

5682.96 --> 5686.159
there's all kinds of bacteria in all

5684.8 --> 5688.639
kinds of locations

5686.159 --> 5690.638999999999
that do things specific things that are

5688.639 --> 5692.56
required and then there's bacteria that

5690.639 --> 5694.96
kind of

5692.56 --> 5696.2390000000005
your body gets used to but they're not

5694.96 --> 5698.56
very beneficial

5696.239 --> 5701.839999999999
and then eventually your body will try

5698.56 --> 5701.84
to get rid of it

5701.92 --> 5707.119
maybe but

5704.96 --> 5710.0
there are definitely very hostile

5707.119 --> 5714.5599999999995
bacteria out there

5710.0 --> 5717.92
and they do invade the body

5714.56 --> 5720.0
but it depends on the body's condition

5717.92 --> 5720.96
so if you're kind of in a weakened state

5720.0 --> 5723.199
then they will

5720.96 --> 5725.44
definitely invade and your body will

5723.199 --> 5727.44
have very little response at first and

5725.44 --> 5729.5199999999995
then it grows out of control and you get

5727.44 --> 5733.678999999999
serious health situation

5729.52 --> 5735.84
right if you have a very good condition

5733.679 --> 5737.119
then your immune system is going to

5735.84 --> 5741.1990000000005
respond

5737.119 --> 5744.639
quicker with probably

5741.199 --> 5747.28
a very heavy first response situation

5744.639 --> 5748.08
the inflammation will be quick in

5747.28 --> 5750.48
response

5748.08 --> 5752.239
but then also over very quickly because

5750.48 --> 5755.44
the immune system is literally gonna

5752.239 --> 5758.799999999999
focus on the infection

5755.44 --> 5763.678999999999
try to immediately resolve it build it

5758.8 --> 5766.400000000001
immune thing in your blood against it

5763.679 --> 5767.52
and then when it got it yeah your body

5766.4 --> 5770.159
will just solve it

5767.52 --> 5770.8
right if you have a very weakened immune

5770.159 --> 5772.799999999999
system

5770.8 --> 5774.639
that response is going to be late or

5772.8 --> 5777.28
non-existent and that's when you got the

5774.639 --> 5777.28
real problem

5779.76 --> 5786.0
right that's why when you're seriously

5783.04 --> 5788.88
demoralized or weakened from a lack of

5786.0 --> 5789.92
food and all that that's when you get a

5788.88 --> 5793.84
problem when you get

5789.92 --> 5796.08
like a cut because suddenly

5793.84 --> 5798.88
your system is not optimal in the

5796.08 --> 5801.6
defense system it's like

5798.88 --> 5802.2390000000005
well like a country it has borders

5801.6 --> 5804.88
there's

5802.239 --> 5806.48
outsiders wanting to get in right but

5804.88 --> 5808.0
yeah they're special channels like

5806.48 --> 5811.28
through the mouth through

5808.0 --> 5812.159
food there are the border agents that

5811.28 --> 5815.36
take care

5812.159 --> 5817.839999999999
of everything but yeah if suddenly there

5815.36 --> 5820.0
is like oh there's this order the

5817.84 --> 5822.4800000000005
the guards are not getting paid so

5820.0 --> 5824.48
there's less of them

5822.48 --> 5826.48
and then suddenly there is a border

5824.48 --> 5826.959999999999
breach yeah what are you going to do

5826.48 --> 5828.638999999999
then

5826.96 --> 5830.4
then is the problem then they keep on

5828.639 --> 5831.76
coming in because there's no guards to

5830.4 --> 5835.119
stop him right

5831.76 --> 5835.119000000001
it's very similar to that

5838.84 --> 5841.84
anyway

5850.239 --> 5854.239
there's the human body itself that

5851.84 --> 5858.4800000000005
manifests all disease

5854.239 --> 5858.48
as a conscious decision what

5858.96 --> 5865.44
uh well the disease is

5862.32 --> 5869.28
this symptom of the response

5865.44 --> 5873.199
to an infection so the disease comes out

5869.28 --> 5875.44
as a result symptoms are

5873.199 --> 5877.119
there because your body is doing

5875.44 --> 5880.48
something about it

5877.119 --> 5882.4
right and even with non-infections

5880.48 --> 5884.959999999999
when it's like internal mechanics

5882.4 --> 5887.759999999999
because yeah you have bacteria in you

5884.96 --> 5889.84
that at some point can even separately

5887.76 --> 5893.679
become a temporary problem

5889.84 --> 5897.28
because of your condition right

5893.679 --> 5899.36
and the german new medicine discusses

5897.28 --> 5901.92
this

5899.36 --> 5902.5599999999995
it it has actually proven things about

5901.92 --> 5906.639
this that

5902.56 --> 5909.84
if you have a psychological conflict

5906.639 --> 5911.1990000000005
like emotional things terrible things

5909.84 --> 5915.84
that have happened

5911.199 --> 5918.0
some shocking situation that when you

5915.84 --> 5921.119000000001
finally are able to get over it that's

5918.0 --> 5923.52
when the body gives a correlating very

5921.119 --> 5925.92
mapped out correlating

5923.52 --> 5927.679
physiological response that could be

5925.92 --> 5930.4800000000005
interpreted as

5927.679 --> 5931.119
like oh my god i got sick or oh no i got

5930.48 --> 5934.799999999999
cancer

5931.119 --> 5938.08
or something right that's a direct

5934.8 --> 5941.28
so like after after

5938.08 --> 5943.84
response from basically a psychological

5941.28 --> 5947.199
based experience

5943.84 --> 5947.679
so that also happens and that's outside

5947.199 --> 5951.36
of

5947.679 --> 5954.2390000000005
external infection situations right

5951.36 --> 5954.639
you can almost like get an infection

5954.239 --> 5958.239
from

5954.639 --> 5962.08
within the body based on

5958.239 --> 5963.678999999999
heavy situations like demoralizing

5962.08 --> 5967.36
events

5963.679 --> 5969.84
they have a physiological impact after

5967.36 --> 5972.239
it is kind of resolved after you've

5969.84 --> 5974.639
gotten over it

5972.239 --> 5975.919999999999
that's when the body actually starts to

5974.639 --> 5977.84
then

5975.92 --> 5981.84
give the secondary response and this is

5977.84 --> 5981.84
what germany medicine teaches so

5986.08 --> 5993.92
yeah there's multiple things happening

5990.44 --> 5996.159
simultaneously there's a psychosomatics

5993.92 --> 6001.4400000000005
response basically

5996.159 --> 6003.599999999999
that can create disease symptoms

6001.44 --> 6005.199
which is also like an overhaul and then

6003.6 --> 6009.1990000000005
there is infection

6005.199 --> 6012.5599999999995
from the outside which is separate

6009.199 --> 6015.04
but also utilizes

6012.56 --> 6016.88
similar mechanisms right it's

6015.04 --> 6023.84
complicated

6016.88 --> 6023.84
it really is

6024.56 --> 6030.080000000001
cancer is defective mitochondria no no

6027.92 --> 6034.0
it's not

6030.08 --> 6037.6
cancer is very similar to

6034.0 --> 6041.36
virus to what is thought of as

6037.6 --> 6045.52
virus cancer is actually a encapsulated

6041.36 --> 6050.159
it's internal bandages

6045.52 --> 6053.1990000000005
that's what cancer does cancer

6050.159 --> 6056.239
gets to a location where there is like

6053.199 --> 6059.04
damage in yeah

6056.239 --> 6059.759999999999
odd ways like especially emotional

6059.04 --> 6062.239
responses

6059.76 --> 6065.04
it's complicated i can't even just

6062.239 --> 6067.44
explain it like that

6065.04 --> 6068.48
it takes care of the situation you might

6067.44 --> 6071.839999999999
get symptoms

6068.48 --> 6074.239
and then it goes away again unless you

6071.84 --> 6076.159000000001
panic get convinced by some doctor

6074.239 --> 6078.0
you're gonna die then injected with

6076.159 --> 6080.32
poison and radiated

6078.0 --> 6082.48
and then suddenly that really basic

6080.32 --> 6083.679
mechanism that was gonna go away by

6082.48 --> 6087.44
itself

6083.679 --> 6091.119
is suddenly mutated attacked

6087.44 --> 6093.44
right it's like yeah

6091.119 --> 6095.599999999999
and then it becomes something else then

6093.44 --> 6098.08
it turns into a monster

6095.6 --> 6100.08
then it gets actually aggressive when

6098.08 --> 6102.32
you attacked it

6100.08 --> 6102.32
right

6104.32 --> 6111.84
that's cancer it's exactly the opposite

6108.719 --> 6113.679
of what people are taught to think it is

6111.84 --> 6115.04
cancer is not something you should have

6113.679 --> 6118.639
a war on

6115.04 --> 6121.5199999999995
it's something you should learn

6118.639 --> 6122.08
is part of your body and just give it

6121.52 --> 6126.2390000000005
room

6122.08 --> 6128.96
it's part of the life cycle and hurt

6126.239 --> 6129.28
that you might receive and you have to

6128.96 --> 6132.4800000000005
not

6129.28 --> 6135.5199999999995
panic not be afraid not let the [ __ ]

6132.48 --> 6138.799999999999
doctor stories drive you into

6135.52 --> 6141.84
death row mentally

6138.8 --> 6141.84
very important

6144.32 --> 6152.239
cancer is a [ __ ] crafter this is

6148.88 --> 6155.28
that's hilary joey troubled

6152.239 --> 6157.759999999999
it yeah i i guess i see the

6155.28 --> 6159.28
metaphor there yeah it when you start to

6157.76 --> 6161.4400000000005
attack it that's when you're really

6159.28 --> 6165.36
[ __ ]

6161.44 --> 6167.5199999999995
right it's better to just

6165.36 --> 6168.88
let it do its thing and then eventually

6167.52 --> 6171.360000000001
it'll just

6168.88 --> 6172.96
dissolve because that's what happens

6171.36 --> 6176.08
with cancer

6172.96 --> 6181.679
when it's done its thing it

6176.08 --> 6181.679
dissolves that's what it does

6182.0 --> 6185.04
might take some time

6185.52 --> 6191.84
i learn it from you okay

6198.56 --> 6203.52
oh right yeah i called ranty a [ __ ]

6200.639 --> 6203.52
grabbler didn't i

6207.36 --> 6219.839999999999
that's that's odd did you

6210.639 --> 6219.84
compare that but

6236.719 --> 6245.52
right well chabinator yes

6240.8 --> 6251.04
i understand but see that's different

6245.52 --> 6251.040000000001
because yeah if the if a

6251.52 --> 6257.52
a tumor literally stops

6255.119 --> 6258.5599999999995
the functionality of the body like

6257.52 --> 6261.92
closes off an

6258.56 --> 6265.04
artery or prevents closes off

6261.92 --> 6267.92
intestine yeah that's different but then

6265.04 --> 6269.92
you're not actually attacking the cancer

6267.92 --> 6270.88
for being cancer then you have to kind

6269.92 --> 6273.84
of like

6270.88 --> 6275.04
prevent the functionality of the body

6273.84 --> 6279.119000000001
from shutting down

6275.04 --> 6279.119
that's different right

6279.6 --> 6282.4800000000005
that is different

6286.8 --> 6291.92
and yeah that that has to be sized up

6289.679 --> 6291.92
right

6292.159 --> 6295.5199999999995
especially if they're really older it

6294.239 --> 6299.28
gets a little complicated

6295.52 --> 6299.280000000001
it gets a little it gets quite

6300.84 --> 6303.84
complicated

6320.719 --> 6327.28
okay ralph rodriguez

6324.0 --> 6331.119
but you're forgetting though that

6327.28 --> 6333.599999999999
psychological trauma also causes cancer

6331.119 --> 6334.48
and that's proven through german new

6333.6 --> 6337.76
medicine through

6334.48 --> 6341.44
rigorous physical

6337.76 --> 6344.56
testing there's a case for that

6341.44 --> 6347.119
there's a whole blueprint

6344.56 --> 6349.4400000000005
and it's been tested in the field for a

6347.119 --> 6352.4
very long time and it works

6349.44 --> 6359.839999999999
so it's not just those elements that you

6352.4 --> 6359.839999999999
mentioned there

6384.84 --> 6387.84
so

6390.719 --> 6393.76
psychology stress causes oxidative

6393.04 --> 6395.639
stress and

6393.76 --> 6398.08
inflammation well it's still an

6395.639 --> 6401.76
oversimplification like that

6398.08 --> 6405.199
because of the very specific

6401.76 --> 6408.4800000000005
location of the cancer

6405.199 --> 6412.638999999999
effect right germinal medicine

6408.48 --> 6415.678999999999
it's it's not just oh generally this no

6412.639 --> 6418.8
where it appears

6415.679 --> 6422.4
is very specific

6418.8 --> 6425.4400000000005
so it's not just a generalized condition

6422.4 --> 6428.48
that just randomly causes some kind of

6425.44 --> 6431.919999999999
cancer somewhere that's not how it works

6428.48 --> 6431.919999999999
so it's more than just that

6440.8 --> 6443.92
but yeah go look into it germany

6442.8 --> 6447.119000000001
medicine

6443.92 --> 6450.32
it's online how do you spell that well

6447.119 --> 6457.36
german new medicine

6450.32 --> 6460.48
it's not that difficult

6457.36 --> 6461.199
but it might be a little tricky to find

6460.48 --> 6463.919999999999
a proper

6461.199 --> 6463.919999999999
site for that

6464.4 --> 6468.08
because yeah surprise surprise they're

6466.639 --> 6472.56
not they're kind of

6468.08 --> 6472.5599999999995
being avoided by big companies and [ __ ]

6474.719 --> 6478.0
as like an alternative medicine that

6477.52 --> 6480.159000000001
they

6478.0 --> 6485.03
think is not proven even though it has

6480.159 --> 6486.96
literal empirical research behind it

6485.03 --> 6491.119
[Music]

6486.96 --> 6494.4
and find this one see if i can find the

6491.119 --> 6494.4
english version of this

6496.84 --> 6499.84
dammit

6511.6 --> 6517.360000000001
okay unfortunately i only have a dutch

6514.48 --> 6517.36
version of this

6520.719 --> 6527.84
there should be english

6524.239 --> 6527.839999999999
versions out there as well

6528.56 --> 6530.96
anyway

6531.76 --> 6535.6
you're a flat earther okay that's good

6535.76 --> 6541.84
good for you

6547.6 --> 6555.1990000000005
right nathan r that's a good one indeed

6550.719 --> 6559.44
just don't be afraid

6555.199 --> 6563.44
and just like with virus particles just

6559.44 --> 6566.5599999999995
no it's part of your body

6563.44 --> 6567.28
it was always there you shouldn't be

6566.56 --> 6571.52
afraid

6567.28 --> 6574.239
of standard mechanisms in your body

6571.52 --> 6574.88
right you shouldn't be afraid of that

6574.239 --> 6577.36
that's a

6574.88 --> 6578.159000000001
silly thing to be afraid of of something

6577.36 --> 6583.839999999999
that you were

6578.159 --> 6583.839999999999
designed with

6594.84 --> 6597.84
um

6608.32 --> 6618.08
yeah iron 26 like leaf

6612.8 --> 6622.8
don't poke here we go again please don't

6618.08 --> 6639.84
just just never do that please right

6622.8 --> 6639.84
it's not doesn't lead to good things

6650.32 --> 6655.04
right look here we go right am i right

6652.88 --> 6657.04
or not

6655.04 --> 6658.96
because you are defending your

6657.04 --> 6661.92
protesting and i

6658.96 --> 6662.4800000000005
totally get that right and i agree with

6661.92 --> 6665.599
it

6662.48 --> 6669.199
at this point yeah england is

6665.599 --> 6672.32
very [ __ ] and what else are you gonna

6669.199 --> 6673.678999999999
just gonna stand by do nothing

6672.32 --> 6675.92
from the presumption that there's

6673.679 --> 6679.119
nothing you can do about it or are you

6675.92 --> 6680.4800000000005
going to just keep protesting for as

6679.119 --> 6683.199
long as it's possible

6680.48 --> 6683.839999999999
right it doesn't matter if it doesn't do

6683.199 --> 6686.638999999999
[ __ ]

6683.84 --> 6689.04
you know what it does do it gives the

6686.639 --> 6689.04
people

6689.119 --> 6693.598999999999
a chance to express what they really

6691.28 --> 6696.639
feel about it in a society where this

6693.599 --> 6699.76
is getting restricted more and more so

6696.639 --> 6702.639
just as a psychological response

6699.76 --> 6706.84
it definitely does do [ __ ] even though

6702.639 --> 6709.4400000000005
judicially it probably won't do anything

6706.84 --> 6713.04
right false hope

6709.44 --> 6716.5599999999995
oh really well you you think that

6713.04 --> 6720.239
just staying home and feeling despair

6716.56 --> 6720.2390000000005
you think that's a better alternative

6720.48 --> 6725.119
i don't think so i'm 26 i don't think so

6729.84 --> 6734.56
no if you are frustrated about how how

6733.119 --> 6737.759999999999
your country is

6734.56 --> 6739.1990000000005
dealing with situations then going out

6737.76 --> 6743.360000000001
to protest

6739.199 --> 6751.44
is a personal necessity to express

6743.36 --> 6753.598999999999
what you feel right

6751.44 --> 6754.799999999999
false binary there are other oh like

6753.599 --> 6758.32
what like

6754.8 --> 6758.320000000001
what iron 26

6763.44 --> 6768.4
so what do you suggest she does

6776.84 --> 6780.400000000001
instead

6778.639 --> 6782.719
or you hadn't thought about that yet

6780.4 --> 6784.719
right if you're going to say there is

6782.719 --> 6785.679
better options you better will have one

6784.719 --> 6788.719
available

6785.679 --> 6789.28
to represent because otherwise you're

6788.719 --> 6793.84
just

6789.28 --> 6793.84
discouraging with no alternative

6803.52 --> 6807.360000000001
community building gathering like-minded

6805.599 --> 6811.599
people together

6807.36 --> 6814.719
and how are you supposed to do that

6811.599 --> 6817.76
if you don't get out of your house

6814.719 --> 6818.32
get on the street and protest where you

6817.76 --> 6821.360000000001
will

6818.32 --> 6824.4
find like-minded

6821.36 --> 6828.0
people hello

6824.4 --> 6835.759999999999
hello seems like you're getting in a bit

6828.0 --> 6837.76
of a contradiction there

6835.76 --> 6839.92
community building is exactly what that

6837.76 --> 6842.400000000001
is

6839.92 --> 6842.96
you're finding other people that are

6842.4 --> 6846.239
with you

6842.96 --> 6849.36
on this you can connect

6846.239 --> 6851.44
beyond the protest and that is how you

6849.36 --> 6852.88
build a community if nobody got out

6851.44 --> 6854.239
because they thought it was completely

6852.88 --> 6855.76
hopeless how are you going to build a

6854.239 --> 6859.199
community based on

6855.76 --> 6861.04
hopelessness and isolation voluntarily

6859.199 --> 6863.839999999999
how are you going to do that doesn't

6861.04 --> 6863.84
make any sense

6867.76 --> 6871.4400000000005
we are now online for one example no

6870.719 --> 6875.44
protest

6871.44 --> 6877.199
oh really and

6875.44 --> 6879.678999999999
i think how fast do you think that's

6877.199 --> 6879.678999999999
gonna go

6880.719 --> 6885.92
are you gonna meet hundreds of people in

6883.04 --> 6885.92
your direct

6888.84 --> 6892.639
environment

6890.4 --> 6894.719
i mean like it's good to have like your

6892.639 --> 6898.32
own online community and all that

6894.719 --> 6901.679
right but is that really

6898.32 --> 6902.88
going to counterweight the hostile

6901.679 --> 6905.84
takeover of

6902.88 --> 6905.84
the system

6907.92 --> 6914.8
is it i mean it might help inform you

6911.28 --> 6917.92
all that sure it'll be

6914.8 --> 6920.0
like a relief valve where you can find

6917.92 --> 6923.599
like at least some like-minded people

6920.0 --> 6926.48
sure does that really build a community

6923.599 --> 6927.52
in the face of what's actually happening

6926.48 --> 6930.959999999999
in the location

6927.52 --> 6933.92
no no when you protest

6930.96 --> 6934.96
you protest with people from your

6933.92 --> 6937.28
location

6934.96 --> 6938.4800000000005
and then you get to know the people from

6937.28 --> 6940.08
your location

6938.48 --> 6942.0
that's how you actually build a

6940.08 --> 6944.84
community right so

6942.0 --> 6946.639
no i totally disagree with your approach

6944.84 --> 6950.159000000001
there

6946.639 --> 6952.719
clutch bear and iron 26 right

6950.159 --> 6954.799999999999
if it's just going to be protesting and

6952.719 --> 6955.76
just like oh no i just want to go out

6954.8 --> 6958.159000000001
and yay

6955.76 --> 6960.719
party on the street yeah if that's your

6958.159 --> 6964.159
attitude yeah that doesn't help [ __ ]

6960.719 --> 6966.719
right but if you're really serious

6964.159 --> 6968.0
and you do want to connect people and

6966.719 --> 6971.28
you are trying to find

6968.0 --> 6974.0
others in in your location then

6971.28 --> 6974.32
yeah that's good that's actually how you

6974.0 --> 6976.8
do

6974.32 --> 6978.239
find new people and build a community in

6976.8 --> 6981.28
your location

6978.239 --> 6983.5199999999995
in your environment online

6981.28 --> 6988.5599999999995
you're not gonna just bump into people

6983.52 --> 6990.400000000001
from your location like that

6988.56 --> 6991.84
you're going to find like-minded people

6990.4 --> 6994.32
from all over the world but it's going

6991.84 --> 6996.96
to be much more scattered

6994.32 --> 7003.84
right so no i'm absolutely with here we

6996.96 --> 7003.84
go again

7028.719 --> 7031.92
yeah now you're just being negative

7030.56 --> 7035.280000000001
nancy's you too

7031.92 --> 7035.28
just just drop it

7039.84 --> 7045.84
i think the point was made pretty clear

7043.199 --> 7045.839999999999
right

7048.56 --> 7052.88
started finding like-minded people at my

7051.119 --> 7054.88
place of work and at supermarket

7052.88 --> 7057.4400000000005

7054.88 --> 7057.4400000000005
important

7057.679 --> 7060.96
i wish i would find more like-minded

7060.0 --> 7065.36
people

7060.96 --> 7068.32
where i go i'm starting to see a couple

7065.36 --> 7070.239
of non-mask wearers

7068.32 --> 7072.08
people that don't wear masks even in

7070.239 --> 7075.36
supermarket places and that's a great

7072.08 --> 7077.679
relief and i'm like like literally my

7075.36 --> 7080.88
eyes open up like this and i'm like

7077.679 --> 7084.0
yes yes this is

7080.88 --> 7087.84
because it's kind of rare

7084.0 --> 7087.84
