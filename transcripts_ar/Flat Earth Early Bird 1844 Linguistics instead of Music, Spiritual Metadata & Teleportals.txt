133.8 --> 139.8
coming

135.56 --> 139.8
right weather today is

140.0 --> 148.76
again it's like

142.319 --> 152.35999999999999
a gray soup it's more wh it's just

148.76 --> 154.44
hazy do see some Trails but I don't know

152.36 --> 157.519
if they really have anything to do with

154.44 --> 160.48
it but it's just like a haze and it's

157.519 --> 160.48000000000002
very windy

161.48 --> 165.48
continually it's not cold

169.8 --> 178.20000000000002
though everything looks just

173.08 --> 178.20000000000002
fine but the wind gets a bit tiresome

178.76 --> 186.84
sometimes

181.159 --> 190.44
just winds me up cats also go

186.84 --> 192.0
nuts at the white cat over here like

190.44 --> 195.28
almost all

192.0 --> 197.799
night it was really Pleasant though like

195.28 --> 201.519
it just wanted to

197.799 --> 203.36
cuddle and some snacks sometimes never

201.519 --> 206.36
even bit me once which is really

203.36 --> 209.959
surprising considering the weather and

206.36 --> 212.68
everything but like our relationship

209.959 --> 215.68
it's like really taming up at at first

212.68 --> 218.4
that cat was like kind of

215.68 --> 221.43900000000002
vicious like would instantly lash out

218.4 --> 224.0
now he's he's literally presenting his

221.439 --> 227.48
belly and everything and I'm like still

224.0 --> 229.68
not eager to just like still very

227.48 --> 231.319
careful because I'm pretty sure if I

229.68 --> 234.15900000000002
just go for it he's immediately going to

231.319 --> 237.11999999999998
have to reflex it but I'm like I've come

234.159 --> 238.67999999999998
so far with Kitty

237.12 --> 240.519
petting

238.68 --> 244.68
yeah

240.519 --> 244.68
that is an art and it is

251.56 --> 259.16
therapeutical right

255.16 --> 261.71999999999997
anyhow it is Wednesday the 24th of

259.16 --> 261.72
January

262.759 --> 268.6
2024 temperature is probably going to be

265.56 --> 271.4
like between 7 and 10 or

268.6 --> 275.0
something

271.4 --> 280.479
oh 11 all

275.0 --> 280.479
right and it's a to early lines day

293.68 --> 297.36
again right so yeah

297.6 --> 303.24
yesterday busy day media wise that

305.919 --> 312.35999999999996
is thought my show was great very happy

310.199 --> 315.56
about

312.36 --> 318.24
it my shows have been

315.56 --> 320.52
great not perfect there's always

318.24 --> 325.199
something here and there

320.52 --> 328.479
and but uh yeah I was actually just now

325.199 --> 330.319
watching my old interview with

328.479 --> 332.919
Patricia

330.319 --> 337.759
and watching it for like 20

332.919 --> 342.12
minutes and holy [ __ ] was I stumbly and

337.759 --> 344.28000000000003
had weird accent issues I noticed like

342.12 --> 346.639
man the way I pronounced things were

344.28 --> 346.63899999999995
like

347.919 --> 357.039
really subconsciously British

351.88 --> 357.039
somehow that really rolled down on

357.199 --> 364.319
that I've changed

360.919 --> 366.919
become more consistent and less

364.319 --> 370.599
stumbling I think also just in the

366.919 --> 370.599
overall way that I

375.36 --> 382.96000000000004
talk how I don't I'm at a loss for words

379.72 --> 386.40000000000003
how to describe it it's

382.96 --> 386.4
just more

388.16 --> 391.72
structured more more

394.84 --> 401.44
pronounced it's just less

397.639 --> 403.639
it's more clear I'm I've become more

401.44 --> 405.36
clear in my

403.639 --> 407.68
Expressions my

405.36 --> 413.91900000000004
communication and it's still plenty of

407.68 --> 413.919
weirdness to me and I have like

414.08 --> 420.919
a an inner thing it's like my own sort

417.759 --> 423.24
of humor it's my private humor that's

420.919 --> 425.31899999999996
like I don't expect anybody to really

423.24 --> 429.12
know this but if you do

425.319 --> 430.319
like yeah then you just know that's me

429.12 --> 434.199
where

430.319 --> 438.24
I I create like mind

434.199 --> 441.44
puzzles I do like weird

438.24 --> 445.319
twists to certain things in a very

441.44 --> 448.96
specific way that's like

445.319 --> 451.319
off in its straightforward Logic on

448.96 --> 451.31899999999996
purpose

452.639 --> 458.28000000000003
it's almost like a sarcastic twist but

455.08 --> 461.84
it's but it's really like a a thing that

458.28 --> 465.919
I just do and it amuses me

461.84 --> 468.71999999999997
greatly to me it's almost like treating

465.919 --> 473.039
the information like it's music on on a

468.72 --> 477.199
piano and then just like doing a little

473.039 --> 482.36
Trixie with it it feels like

477.199 --> 485.56
that right and also yeah feeds back

482.36 --> 488.68
to my overall considerations when I was

485.56 --> 493.72
younger like yeah I come from a music

488.68 --> 496.599
family that guitar teacher very good at

493.72 --> 499.47900000000004
it like he was could do pretty amazing

496.599 --> 502.87899999999996
things with the guitar I mean not

499.479 --> 506.159
like like those YouTube virtuosas or

502.879 --> 511.159
whatever but he could like do some wide

506.159 --> 513.7189999999999
range stuff styles really and like very

511.159 --> 515.3199999999999
it's just very impressive he doesn't do

513.719 --> 519.24
it anymore he like got issues with his

515.32 --> 523.44
finger so it like hurts very tragic

519.24 --> 527.399
anyway but he's been amazing and my mom

523.44 --> 532.0400000000001
was in with piano and composing all

527.399 --> 535.72
kinds of stuff classic but and Jazz

532.04 --> 535.7199999999999
things like a jazz

537.32 --> 543.6400000000001
adjacent but I just never I always

542.279 --> 547.16
enjoyed

543.64 --> 550.3199999999999
music but it always like scared me in a

547.16 --> 553.16
way like I'm afraid to like do it myself

550.32 --> 555.9200000000001
to play around with it it's almost like

553.16 --> 559.279
I don't trust

555.92 --> 561.5999999999999
myself with music like what if I start

559.279 --> 562.76
weirdly playing around like it like I do

561.6 --> 566.519
with

562.76 --> 568.12
words I don't know I I just don't think

566.519 --> 570.68
I don't

568.12 --> 574.279
know

570.68 --> 577.959
I always bolted away from it like my mom

574.279 --> 581.6
did offer to like teach me to play piano

577.959 --> 584.3199999999999
but it scared me this is really weird

581.6 --> 586.88
too like it wasn't like other people

584.32 --> 589.9200000000001
ever knew about that it's just on an

586.88 --> 593.88
intuitive level it just like it made me

589.92 --> 593.88
emotional and

595.8 --> 600.4399999999999
like it was just too powerful for me

598.8 --> 603.24
almost

600.44 --> 606.36
it impressed me too much music in

603.24 --> 606.36
general but especially

607.519 --> 616.0
piano so I dared not engage with it like

612.56 --> 619.04
I I couldn't let it go to where you

616.0 --> 623.72
could get actually to that music Flow

619.04 --> 626.1999999999999
State I I it was too too heavy for

623.72 --> 629.6800000000001
me but with

626.2 --> 631.36
speech I had a very early on development

629.68 --> 634.7199999999999
it's like oh they're trying to teach me

631.36 --> 637.16
music I'm talking I'm trying to like

634.72 --> 639.839
really reason out and

637.16 --> 642.399
develop proper talking and like

639.839 --> 644.72
complicated trains of thinking when I'm

642.399 --> 647.72
like really young starting really really

644.72 --> 651.0400000000001
young like anything I could latch on to

647.72 --> 654.48
hear about I would expound on it and try

651.04 --> 656.04
to intuitively see if I would guess

654.48 --> 659.0790000000001
everything that would be

656.04 --> 663.04
involved I would hear about something

659.079 --> 667.7199999999999
thing and then guess what what it was

663.04 --> 670.8389999999999
about and often stumbl when I was

667.72 --> 671.8000000000001
younger but then eventually well by now

670.839 --> 673.639
I'm

671.8 --> 676.68
like

673.639 --> 681.44
well it's it becoming harder to bump

676.68 --> 681.4399999999999
into something completely new like

682.56 --> 690.959
structure-wise in order for me not to be

684.959 --> 690.959
able to predict a whole trajectory

691.44 --> 697.0790000000001
that's going to be well halfway accurate

694.519 --> 700.48
right on

697.079 --> 704.6389999999999
anything right so what I did is

700.48 --> 706.32
basically use or rerouted all the

704.639 --> 708.2
potential musical Talent which would

706.32 --> 710.88
have obviously been there and I'm very

708.2 --> 714.399
sensitive to it but I rerouted it to

710.88 --> 714.399
like communication skills

716.48 --> 722.16
instead and they did my parents didn't

719.36 --> 724.839
ask me to do that it's

722.16 --> 727.3199999999999
like well we use communication and

724.839 --> 730.6800000000001
they're both teachers right teaching

727.32 --> 734.399
skills to basically homeschool me in

730.68 --> 738.0
this on a higher level but then instead

734.399 --> 738.0
of really getting good at the

738.72 --> 746.6800000000001
music which would actually emphasize my

741.8 --> 747.88
introver more I tried to throw myself

746.68 --> 750.88
onto

747.88 --> 750.88
communication

751.36 --> 756.279
and and turn in quite a bit of a

753.36 --> 760.6800000000001
virtuoso but only when I was really

756.279 --> 762.76
young to like actually talk English like

760.68 --> 766.8
when I was

762.76 --> 770.04
seven like to try it and then like but

766.8 --> 772.8
like I would try it when I was six okay

770.04 --> 775.76
and then like be so embarrassed that I

772.8 --> 778.4799999999999
got it wrong I still remember that

775.76 --> 782.12
feeling like I'm GNA talk English and

778.48 --> 784.9200000000001
then a [ __ ] really like that's like oh

782.12 --> 787.5600000000001
my God so embarrassing

784.92 --> 790.56
but then I like

787.56 --> 793.8
waited like listen more to it listen

790.56 --> 795.1199999999999
more English for like a year like really

793.8 --> 797.76
like this is my

795.12 --> 800.48
mission almost like military I have to

797.76 --> 803.24
learn this and then I tried again and

800.48 --> 805.0
like yeah I could actually make it work

803.24 --> 807.76
I would get some words wrong but it

805.0 --> 809.959
would be fluid it wouldn't break

807.76 --> 813.079
and

809.959 --> 815.3599999999999
I couldn't like talk fluid but I could

813.079 --> 817.6389999999999
say some things now in English suddenly

815.36 --> 820.32
like I didn't have that nobody taught me

817.639 --> 824.36
that I taught me that it's just I've

820.32 --> 824.36
been a language Enthusiast

824.68 --> 830.68
really with

826.76 --> 830.68
English from a very young

830.88 --> 839.959
age and being language Enthusiast that

834.92 --> 842.88
young has also generally helped to like

839.959 --> 843.8
it is really just like communication not

842.88 --> 846.6
just

843.8 --> 850.16
language so it's like also understanding

846.6 --> 852.5600000000001
body language like divining motivation

850.16 --> 855.519
like in the moment or like what is

852.56 --> 857.5999999999999
somebody sensing and then figuring out

855.519 --> 859.88
how they're responding to how they deal

857.6 --> 863.24
with their sensories I mean all kinds of

859.88 --> 867.959
spiritual metadata a lot of

863.24 --> 871.04
it it all came extra it's like oh you

867.959 --> 873.7589999999999
level up oh wow got good at language oh

871.04 --> 875.959
level up oh you're getting good at body

873.759 --> 878.519
language and then level up like whoa

875.959 --> 881.7589999999999
what the hell there's another layer

878.519 --> 883.8
spiritual metadata figuring out how th

881.759 --> 888.72
how things are decided

883.8 --> 892.92
like a whole web of like Consciousness

888.72 --> 896.0400000000001
and decision and then how that develops

892.92 --> 900.5999999999999
infrastructure Insight that just comes

896.04 --> 903.079
on top of it like what

900.6 --> 906.32
that's apparently what happens when you

903.079 --> 908.5999999999999
develop communication really fanatically

906.32 --> 911.8000000000001
on a spiritual level very

908.6 --> 911.8000000000001
young right

912.56 --> 918.4399999999999
anyway but I had a long way to

916.279 --> 920.4399999999999
go oh

918.44 --> 924.2790000000001
ads

920.44 --> 927.5600000000001
o oh go to school

924.279 --> 929.8389999999999
ads yeah well school never had any

927.56 --> 933.5999999999999
direct involvement in

929.839 --> 933.6
this I can tell you

935.72 --> 944.1990000000001
that I mean I had a great English

938.68 --> 947.68
teacher who was hilarious and loved like

944.199 --> 951.24
complicated British but not like was not

947.68 --> 953.959
like a snoody with it and always like

951.24 --> 957.16
like arrogant no he was a funny guy and

953.959 --> 960.04
he liked Black Adder and Mony Pyon and

957.16 --> 962.8
it's like yes

960.04 --> 966.48
I mean that was freaking like English is

962.8 --> 969.639
like oh yeah I'll go to English because

966.48 --> 973.759
then we get to do awesome stuff watch

969.639 --> 976.72
really funny videos that are really

973.759 --> 979.36
interesting like on an actual television

976.72 --> 979.36
with a

982.6 --> 987.9200000000001
videotape awesome I have such good

985.48 --> 991.24
memories of that and he would be very

987.92 --> 991.24
helpful and got a pretty good

991.56 --> 997.04
grade it's just a very laidback guy who

994.56 --> 999.0
would like really give me my room he

997.04 --> 1001.12
would get that I'm like yeah high

999.0 --> 1003.079
pressure

1001.12 --> 1006.24
complicated but

1003.079 --> 1008.319
really underneath all the complications

1006.24 --> 1009.279
really trying to do their best and just

1008.319 --> 1011.16
being

1009.279 --> 1015.519
misunderstood

1011.16 --> 1017.48
logically by everybody and he got that

1015.519 --> 1020.48
really

1017.48 --> 1020.48
well

1020.959 --> 1029.6399999999999
but like the real talent is just like me

1025.16 --> 1032.4
being so focus on it like this hunger

1029.64 --> 1036.7990000000002
for like I want to understand

1032.4 --> 1036.799
communication I just want to understand

1039.319 --> 1042.319
communication

1042.799 --> 1049.08
because everything started out people's

1046.6 --> 1051.28
actions and motivations and what drives

1049.08 --> 1055.72
them and what they let in them energy

1051.28 --> 1058.72
and spirit wise was all so alien to

1055.72 --> 1061.48
me outside of like my

1058.72 --> 1064.76
parents which were and they were kind of

1061.48 --> 1067.4
nutty and well not really bad but they

1064.76 --> 1070.039
had weird quirks logically I mean I have

1067.4 --> 1073.44
them they got

1070.039 --> 1075.96
them but everybody else in ways was so

1073.44 --> 1079.159
alien and like

1075.96 --> 1081.28
deceptive this was especially like so

1079.159 --> 1083.1200000000001
scary and offputting to me like as a

1081.28 --> 1085.84
little kid noticing that that there's

1083.12 --> 1088.52
like people out there that just like

1085.84 --> 1092.28
look in a certain way and compose

1088.52 --> 1095.48
themselves but it's like a complete lie

1092.28 --> 1099.24
like a really scary lie and they could

1095.48 --> 1103.4
like mentally just like completely go

1099.24 --> 1105.28
crazy if you discovered that and I would

1103.4 --> 1107.44
see that kind of thing and then

1105.28 --> 1110.36
accidentally Drive these people up the

1107.44 --> 1112.6000000000001
wall by identifying how they were a

1110.36 --> 1115.4799999999998
complete

1112.6 --> 1117.9189999999999
lie just by

1115.48 --> 1121.84
accident got myself in all kinds of

1117.919 --> 1121.8400000000001
trouble with my

1122.84 --> 1128.039
insights and just this Auto habit of

1125.72 --> 1132.32
like oh yeah I'm just going to tell you

1128.039 --> 1132.32
like no you shouldn't do

1133.159 --> 1138.1200000000001
that and it's not even like casually

1135.72 --> 1140.4
telling it like I would enthusiastically

1138.12 --> 1143.12
tell it's like oh wow I just figured

1140.4 --> 1143.1200000000001
this out about

1144.799 --> 1153.799
you but yeah that scares the hell out of

1149.96 --> 1156.3600000000001
people like they don't have those skills

1153.799 --> 1159.0
so they suddenly feel like there's a spy

1156.36 --> 1162.3999999999999
or something going after them something

1159.0 --> 1164.76
really crazy or or like a little devil

1162.4 --> 1167.0
it's like how is a kid supposed to have

1164.76 --> 1167.0
that

1167.24 --> 1170.4
ability

1169.039 --> 1173.039
you

1170.4 --> 1175.4
know

1173.039 --> 1179.24
anyway why is nobody else coming I don't

1175.4 --> 1179.24
know duper maybe because they're not

1181.559 --> 1185.32
here welcome by the

1197.24 --> 1200.24
way

1202.6 --> 1207.799
Patricia will return to YouTube in two

1205.32 --> 1207.799
oh that's

1209.559 --> 1215.8799999999999
cool I hope she still likes

1212.88 --> 1219.0800000000002
me I hope she forgives me for all my

1215.88 --> 1223.679
crankiness these days I have like

1219.08 --> 1223.6789999999999
hardened up a bit I'll admit

1224.2 --> 1229.32
it but I mean these people out there are

1227.24 --> 1233.1200000000001
deranged and

1229.32 --> 1235.72
Savage and they're not they don't hold

1233.12 --> 1238.6789999999999
back now I

1235.72 --> 1242.48
mean eight years ago they were out there

1238.679 --> 1245.44
but they held back they were nervous to

1242.48 --> 1249.039
be seen now they're also just

1245.44 --> 1249.039
like they'll

1249.28 --> 1255.1589999999999
just create exposes about their own

1253.039 --> 1260.12
derangement with

1255.159 --> 1260.1200000000001
pride it's really scary

1263.44 --> 1266.48
and then Knack

1266.64 --> 1271.159
people all right

1268.679 --> 1274.6000000000001
anyway lots of participants yeah I'm

1271.159 --> 1274.6000000000001
sure they're all watching

1276.2 --> 1283.039
whatever I mean I'm okay duper you're

1280.2 --> 1283.039
here

1284.72 --> 1290.039
right what do you want to talk about

1296.08 --> 1301.36
School teaches there is only five

1299.279 --> 1304.36
vowels

1301.36 --> 1306.279
okay

1304.36 --> 1309.52
well in

1306.279 --> 1310.72
the technically yeah good point I mean

1309.52 --> 1317.039
there's

1310.72 --> 1321.6000000000001
like weird variations in in

1317.039 --> 1325.76
files but this is just

1321.6 --> 1329.279
like meta this is like meta

1325.76 --> 1330.72
design it's like you just you're just

1329.279 --> 1333.559
supposed to know

1330.72 --> 1335.1200000000001
that it's like yeah this is like oh this

1333.559 --> 1337.24
is how it's constructed General

1335.12 --> 1339.84
construction this is how you actually

1337.24 --> 1342.1200000000001
use it like h no you have to say it just

1339.84 --> 1344.9599999999998
like that it's like how do you know that

1342.12 --> 1347.76
you just have to remember it that's just

1344.96 --> 1348.52
it it there's nothing oh and if you're

1347.76 --> 1352.039
like

1348.52 --> 1354.679
a few your 100 miles that way well then

1352.039 --> 1356.919
you say it like that slightly different

1354.679 --> 1359.279
again like yeah yeah good luck

1356.919 --> 1361.72
remembering all that oh oh you're not

1359.279 --> 1365.36
super talented at remembering these

1361.72 --> 1369.64
slight Nuance details well then you're

1365.36 --> 1373.12
not going to be a regional Linguistics

1369.64 --> 1373.1200000000001
expert it's that

1376.96 --> 1382.919
simple

1379.679 --> 1387.2
but uh yeah I know but I mean language

1382.919 --> 1387.2
is so elaborate and it

1387.279 --> 1392.4
everywhere all the languages are like

1389.799 --> 1395.0
that they're all complicated they all

1392.4 --> 1397.919
have little nuances here and there and

1395.0 --> 1397.919
they all do

1406.88 --> 1409.88
that

1414.0 --> 1424.48
right I on here I might dig into

1419.24 --> 1424.48
that because I am a bit hungry

1436.88 --> 1439.88
cheers

1459.25 --> 1464.97
[Applause]

1466.799 --> 1469.799
for

1483.87 --> 1487.1899999999998
[Music]

1488.12 --> 1495.9599999999998
all right anyway I'm G to turn on my

1492.399 --> 1495.9599999999998
coffee and I'll be right

1496.76 --> 1499.76
back

1526.679 --> 1529.679
for

1545.72 --> 1548.159
and I'm

1556.679 --> 1559.679
back

1566.76 --> 1569.48
yeah

1569.919 --> 1574.8400000000001
weird yeah I know right duper I don't

1572.32 --> 1574.84
know where they

1577.279 --> 1582.32
are maybe YouTube's like really I

1580.279 --> 1585.64
darkened the notifications or something

1582.32 --> 1585.6399999999999
hey orle

1586.6 --> 1589.6
wumble

1616.6 --> 1621.539
hello

1618.44 --> 1621.539
[Music]

1646.52 --> 1649.52
h

1661.559 --> 1666.24
I really hope that coffee is going to

1663.08 --> 1669.08
wake me up I think that that constant

1666.24 --> 1672.08
flowing wind is just like disrupting my

1669.08 --> 1672.08
concentration

1672.24 --> 1677.08
sometimes like in the startup I mean

1674.799 --> 1679.519
once it gets going it it'll it'll keep

1677.08 --> 1679.519
going but

1685.48 --> 1692.1200000000001
over 20 English

1688.48 --> 1694.24
what you're going to have to like give

1692.12 --> 1697.08
me some citation on that there there

1694.24 --> 1699.0
must be some kind of page that would

1697.08 --> 1700.9189999999999
describe

1699.0 --> 1704.039
that hey

1700.919 --> 1706.44
clamy sleepy hat no I'm not exactly

1704.039 --> 1709.44
sleepy I'm

1706.44 --> 1709.44
just

1709.679 --> 1714.88
having trouble starting up my main

1714.919 --> 1719.7990000000002
processor or the no it's not my name

1718.279 --> 1724.88
what do you call

1719.799 --> 1730.96
that the thing that I do to

1724.88 --> 1730.96
get going start up the the virtual

1735.12 --> 1741.2099999999998
Dynamo right Idea Idea Idea Idea Idea

1740.36 --> 1743.519
Idea

1741.21 --> 1746.3990000000001
[Music]

1743.519 --> 1751.0
Idea and then it's just

1746.399 --> 1754.08
like just keep going no effort and I

1751.0 --> 1754.08
have to get it going

1755.679 --> 1760.519
first hey Akuma virus

1766.32 --> 1769.32
Tommy

1772.0 --> 1776.88
yeah akumar I think that is exactly what

1774.84 --> 1779.039
go it's going he is confusing the

1776.88 --> 1781.919
pronunciation with the actual

1779.039 --> 1785.039
vowel but the weird thing is is that the

1781.919 --> 1788.1200000000001
pronunciation is

1785.039 --> 1790.039
just it's basically just like yeah screw

1788.12 --> 1793.559
you you just have to

1790.039 --> 1795.919
know that was kind of the issue it is

1793.559 --> 1798.799
true it's like yeah you just have to

1795.919 --> 1801.039
know and oh yeah 100 miles that way yeah

1798.799 --> 1802.72
it's slightly like this yeah you just

1801.039 --> 1803.6
have to know if you don't know well you

1802.72 --> 1807.44
don't

1803.6 --> 1808.7199999999998
know the you don't you can't derive that

1807.44 --> 1812.3990000000001
from how it's

1808.72 --> 1816.039
written that's the bizarre thing

1812.399 --> 1819.1999999999998
really like this is whole

1816.039 --> 1822.24
Meta Meta line

1819.2 --> 1823.96
data just like epigenetics versus

1822.24 --> 1826.24
genetics is like oh yeah there's this

1823.96 --> 1828.96
whole thing like yeah that's actually

1826.24 --> 1833.559
the

1828.96 --> 1835.8400000000001
it's a whole subata of critical

1833.559 --> 1838.08
data that is

1835.84 --> 1841.559
Unwritten I think that would be the best

1838.08 --> 1841.559
way to describe it

1844.64 --> 1848.8400000000001
yeah all right so glad you all finally

1847.72 --> 1852.3600000000001
managed to

1848.84 --> 1852.36
get to get

1856.24 --> 1862.2
here

1859.039 --> 1862.2
feel very inspired

1862.76 --> 1867.639
today but yeah at the same time bit

1865.399 --> 1873.36
trouble with concentrating all this wind

1867.639 --> 1873.36
continually going how you defined metad

1875.919 --> 1880.44
dat information between the information

1878.799 --> 1883.1589999999999
it's like

1880.44 --> 1885.679
the there's information and then there's

1883.159 --> 1889.159
the information that is in between the

1885.679 --> 1889.159
information that you can

1889.6 --> 1893.48
derive the other

1900.84 --> 1904.9189999999999
information so there's like the

1903.24 --> 1907.84
information and then there's the

1904.919 --> 1911.0800000000002
information about the information like

1907.84 --> 1915.6
how did it get there

1911.08 --> 1918.279
when what kind of format is the

1915.6 --> 1920.6
information what is the field of the

1918.279 --> 1923.24
information what is the source of the

1920.6 --> 1926.1589999999999
like there's a lot of things that are

1923.24 --> 1929.519
there that aren't like directly the

1926.159 --> 1929.519
information right

1943.88 --> 1951.24
metadata vowel sounds right well that

1947.919 --> 1953.3600000000001
duper that technically falls under

1951.24 --> 1957.2
pronunciation and the weird thing is

1953.36 --> 1961.4799999999998
it's it's Unwritten you just have to

1957.2 --> 1963.919
know I mean there are like these ways to

1961.48 --> 1963.919
describe

1965.2 --> 1971.44
it right there are

1968.6 --> 1973.559
pronunciation descriptions and these

1971.44 --> 1975.72
days you have like little recordings of

1973.559 --> 1977.8799999999999
somebody actually saying it which is

1975.72 --> 1981.32
very helpful that that exists

1977.88 --> 1983.7600000000002
now cuz then yeah you get the example

1981.32 --> 1987.48
like this is just how it

1983.76 --> 1989.519
is right because that is what it is that

1987.48 --> 1993.039
is where the The Knack is where the

1989.519 --> 1995.279
issue is is that you can't really derive

1993.039 --> 1999.36
it from how it's written you just have

1995.279 --> 2000.72
to hear it from somebody that knows so

1999.36 --> 2005.9599999999998
it's

2000.72 --> 2008.96
an A Word of Mouth only

2005.96 --> 2008.96
information

2019.0 --> 2024.44
see so this whole layer of missing

2022.559 --> 2027.12
information in

2024.44 --> 2028.3200000000002
language that you just have to know it's

2027.12 --> 2031.2399999999998
like

2028.32 --> 2035.12
secret the only way to actually know it

2031.24 --> 2038.08
is by knowing it by knowing the people

2035.12 --> 2040.4399999999998
that know it

2038.08 --> 2043.12
by having experienced it you you have to

2040.44 --> 2046.6000000000001
be there right it's the you have to be

2043.12 --> 2046.6
there component of the

2053.679 --> 2058.599
language right I'm going to get my

2055.599 --> 2058.599
coffee I'll be right

2065.879 --> 2068.879
back

2125.88 --> 2128.8
h

2145.24 --> 2148.1189999999997
it's nothing

2150.4 --> 2156.079
better in the start of the show for me I

2154.359 --> 2158.119
don't know maybe you're into it maybe

2156.079 --> 2162.96
you just think why the hell is he doing

2158.119 --> 2165.839
this during the show well because I want

2162.96 --> 2169.079
to but there's nothing better

2165.839 --> 2173.839
than Illuminati

2169.079 --> 2173.8390000000004
croissant and a nice cup of turmeric

2177.52 --> 2180.88
coffee so

2185.72 --> 2188.72
good

2205.079 --> 2208.8
h a stey

2213.5 --> 2218.68
[Applause]

2215.68 --> 2218.68
traveler

2226.43 --> 2230.64
[Applause]

2250.599 --> 2256.119
yay well it's good enough to put it in

2253.92 --> 2256.119
the

2275.599 --> 2278.599
title

2305.52 --> 2308.52
yes

2313.359 --> 2320.64
yes duper I know there are entire

2316.28 --> 2320.6400000000003
YouTube channels dedicated to teach vowl

2327.599 --> 2331.8
sounds if you're really into

2331.839 --> 2338.52
that I just like to learn from the

2334.96 --> 2338.52
people I deal with

2340.359 --> 2344.119
I mean through like Nathan Oakley

2345.16 --> 2349.56
and

2346.88 --> 2352.96
uh Adam mein

2349.56 --> 2355.16
and Anthony Riley like I've learned more

2352.96 --> 2358.359
about English

2355.16 --> 2360.8799999999997
than ever before like than my English

2358.359 --> 2364.2799999999997
teacher could ever teach

2360.88 --> 2366.52
me I've just learned like so much of

2364.28 --> 2369.48
like like how it is it's not like I

2366.52 --> 2372.16
remember every damn thing okay

2369.48 --> 2376.52
barely but I know it's

2372.16 --> 2378.64
there like I know how detailed it gets

2376.52 --> 2381.96
and that they can

2378.64 --> 2383.1189999999997
tell and so now I know that about it I

2381.96 --> 2385.4
know

2383.119 --> 2388.7200000000003
that English is

2385.4 --> 2393.2000000000003
actually not so straightforward as like

2388.72 --> 2395.9199999999996
television would make you think

2393.2 --> 2396.96
typically in the actual regions so I

2395.92 --> 2398.8
just yeah

2396.96 --> 2403.4
I really

2398.8 --> 2406.6800000000003
thank the British guys from fed for for

2403.4 --> 2409.839
basically teaching me that about

2406.68 --> 2412.839
English it's been a

2409.839 --> 2415.7599999999998
pleasure and hilarious also a bit

2412.839 --> 2419.0789999999997
frustrating sometimes some of the the

2415.76 --> 2421.5600000000004
dissing friends things

2419.079 --> 2425.3590000000004
supposedly

2421.56 --> 2427.88
it sometimes I just don't like

2425.359 --> 2430.5989999999997
it

2427.88 --> 2430.599
it's not my

2433.56 --> 2440.04
style but it seems to work great for you

2436.48 --> 2440.04
guys among one

2445.4 --> 2451.92
another Brian yeah also awesome I

2448.2 --> 2455.04
learned M like I actually learned about

2451.92 --> 2457.2000000000003
Ireland because everything I thought

2455.04 --> 2460.56
about Ireland was just through

2457.2 --> 2463.0
television and it was just

2460.56 --> 2464.839
wrong I learned that through Brian I

2463.0 --> 2467.4
mean every time I listen to Brian it's

2464.839 --> 2467.4
almost

2467.96 --> 2474.96
like it really is like an alien

2471.96 --> 2476.56
language it's like

2474.96 --> 2478.96
weird

2476.56 --> 2481.48
English through a cave you're like

2478.96 --> 2485.2400000000002
you're hearing it through a cave and now

2481.48 --> 2488.2400000000002
I'm automatically going Scottish again

2485.24 --> 2488.24
but

2489.24 --> 2493.72
when Brian actually gets going talking

2491.52 --> 2501.04
it's kind of magical to

2493.72 --> 2501.04
me I don't understand like what

2514.72 --> 2521.2
what and from Dell well yeah I mean

2519.88 --> 2525.76
listening to Dell would have been

2521.2 --> 2525.7599999999998
entertaining if he wasn't such a

2529.839 --> 2534.92
[ __ ] I mean that's that's just it I

2532.44 --> 2538.599
mean it was fun before he went just

2534.92 --> 2538.599
really annoying

2539.079 --> 2545.119
anding earth oh my God it's so so

2545.16 --> 2548.16
stupid

2555.839 --> 2559.119
it's mostly stupid because they don't

2557.599 --> 2561.04
even know what they're doing I mean if

2559.119 --> 2565.48
you're going to presuppose an upward

2561.04 --> 2568.88
Rising Earth call the relative density

2565.48 --> 2572.92
division this is not how you do

2568.88 --> 2576.4
it and again I like I did that show

2572.92 --> 2580.52
about it and I completely called it in

2576.4 --> 2582.4
one go in one response at the very

2580.52 --> 2585.319
beginning of when this weird [ __ ] was

2582.4 --> 2588.6800000000003
rolling out everybody ignored

2585.319 --> 2591.119
me I call it it's just like yeah yeah

2588.68 --> 2594.1189999999997
you can do that it's really cute you can

2591.119 --> 2594.119
never ever prove

2594.24 --> 2601.2
it so it's completely pointless it's

2598.64 --> 2604.52
like mythology like you can never prove

2601.2 --> 2607.4399999999996
it can never prove whether it's it's

2604.52 --> 2610.599
happening or whether it isn't happening

2607.44 --> 2610.599
it's completely

2611.96 --> 2621.68
pointless but no no everybody ignored it

2615.8 --> 2621.6800000000003
and now Dell is upward Rising Earth

2624.319 --> 2629.88
[ __ ] and a whole bunch of other people

2626.839 --> 2629.88
dragging along with

2632.44 --> 2639.04
that like following a Fantastical

2635.44 --> 2641.64
mythology that is

2639.04 --> 2643.72
unprovable chasing an aberration that's

2641.64 --> 2645.8799999999997
literally what that's classified as in

2643.72 --> 2645.8799999999997
my

2656.96 --> 2663.8
book hey Richie G favorite videos by

2660.8 --> 2668.0
Brian anything about spherical triangles

2663.8 --> 2668.0
oh my god oh

2694.16 --> 2702.48
what that is is in one of examples of

2699.24 --> 2705.319
vowel sounds in the words

2702.48 --> 2707.28
Z what

2705.319 --> 2710.0
Mirage

2707.28 --> 2711.4
pleasure is that the you're talking

2710.0 --> 2714.079
about

2711.4 --> 2717.92
treasure

2714.079 --> 2721.6800000000003
me leure

2717.92 --> 2723.559
Fusion it's not fusion

2721.68 --> 2728.2799999999997
fusion yeah

2723.559 --> 2730.52
Fusion Vision decision Vision deis okay

2728.28 --> 2730.52
I get

2734.44 --> 2741.079
it but that's not a a vowel though

2738.839 --> 2743.119
that's right that's the

2741.079 --> 2745.44
opposite what that the other one what do

2743.119 --> 2748.28
you call

2745.44 --> 2752.359
that I I don't even I never learned the

2748.28 --> 2752.3590000000004
words for this in English guys

2754.88 --> 2757.88
so

2759.079 --> 2762.48
what's the counterpart of a

2769.96 --> 2774.7200000000003
vowel I don't even know the words

2772.079 --> 2776.3590000000004
anymore in Dutch so to be fair was never

2774.72 --> 2778.7599999999998
very good at

2776.359 --> 2781.88
that like I'll PR I'll do the

2778.76 --> 2784.8
pronunciation right I can be like a

2781.88 --> 2786.359
parrot I can copy paste that really

2784.8 --> 2788.7200000000003
easily

2786.359 --> 2793.16
but like the knowledge of what it's

2788.72 --> 2795.8799999999997
called like H I had trouble with that in

2793.16 --> 2797.8799999999997
school I like just focus on like

2795.88 --> 2801.079
remembering it all it's like I'm just

2797.88 --> 2803.8
building that Library really early like

2801.079 --> 2807.6400000000003
I can't remember what that's called I

2803.8 --> 2807.6400000000003
just know what I just know how to say

2808.599 --> 2814.8
it consonant right so yeah duper that

2813.24 --> 2817.7999999999997
it's more like a I think it's a

2814.8 --> 2817.8
consonant

2819.28 --> 2821.6800000000003
not a

2829.68 --> 2834.64
vowel so I think that you're mixing up

2832.48 --> 2836.2400000000002
these words as

2834.64 --> 2838.64
well

2836.24 --> 2841.0
typical hey slow moon buggy by the way

2838.64 --> 2841.0
good to see

2844.72 --> 2847.72
you

2862.48 --> 2865.59
[Music]

2874.72 --> 2877.72
m

2904.64 --> 2907.64
in

2909.64 --> 2914.72
I was thinking you know all these people

2912.4 --> 2914.7200000000003
make

2914.88 --> 2919.319
oh

2916.4 --> 2922.319
language dedicated YouTube

2919.319 --> 2925.8
channels specialized fully de like do

2922.319 --> 2929.2
you want to learn your

2925.8 --> 2933.48
language like a robot or do you want to

2929.2 --> 2936.16
learn it like how to build with it to

2933.48 --> 2939.52
get creative with it by seeing somebody

2936.16 --> 2939.52
in action that's really good at

2941.079 --> 2947.3590000000004
it to understand their higher

2945.24 --> 2949.7599999999998
understanding on how to use the words

2947.359 --> 2952.24
right because knowing the words is one

2949.76 --> 2954.96
thing but just knowing the words doesn't

2952.24 --> 2957.68
make you know how to use

2954.96 --> 2961.079
it what can you actually do with

2957.68 --> 2963.5989999999997
language well what can't you do with

2961.079 --> 2966.44
language but how do you figure out what

2963.599 --> 2969.52
to do with language and that it

2966.44 --> 2971.92
works you try out a bunch of things and

2969.52 --> 2974.52
you let people

2971.92 --> 2976.28
judge but if you then judge it

2974.52 --> 2978.64
negatively yourself you're going to

2976.28 --> 2981.2400000000002
withhold it from the

2978.64 --> 2983.319
people cuz you're afraid to be judged

2981.24 --> 2986.7599999999998
for being so stupid and that's why a lot

2983.319 --> 2990.68
of people don't do that they just don't

2986.76 --> 2990.6800000000003
just throw out whatever they they

2993.44 --> 2998.079
written they only want to show the the

2995.68 --> 2998.0789999999997
perfect

2998.44 --> 3001.96
thing but that

3002.359 --> 3009.16
way how do you really know whether

3005.2 --> 3011.9199999999996
something is good or Not underneath all

3009.16 --> 3011.92
the protective

3012.28 --> 3017.7200000000003
layering you never find out and you'll

3014.92 --> 3020.079
always find yourself going down the lane

3017.72 --> 3023.4399999999996
of certain tropes right the more

3020.079 --> 3023.44
professional you get the more

3027.24 --> 3032.72
dead attention grabbing machine formul

3033.319 --> 3038.16
formulaic in language in writing you

3035.64 --> 3038.16
don't want

3048.92 --> 3053.92
that how come I never became a

3051.2 --> 3053.9199999999996
Linguistics

3054.44 --> 3057.44
professor

3057.72 --> 3061.2
because I never thought I was that

3065.72 --> 3076.3999999999996
good I I never actually considered

3071.799 --> 3079.68
it also I have really improved a

3076.4 --> 3084.4
lot in the recent

3079.68 --> 3085.96
decade yeah like recently before that I

3084.4 --> 3087.599
just didn't

3085.96 --> 3091.92
have enough

3087.599 --> 3093.3590000000004
practice to even be able to reach these

3091.92 --> 3095.559
Heights in

3093.359 --> 3097.52
skill right because if you don't

3095.559 --> 3100.6800000000003
practice it like all the time like

3097.52 --> 3105.04
having an everyday

3100.68 --> 3107.44
show for like eight years right if you

3105.04 --> 3110.24
don't do that

3107.44 --> 3113.2400000000002
then well either you have to just get

3110.24 --> 3114.9599999999996
into it on the roll very early and like

3113.24 --> 3118.4799999999996
make your mind up I'm going to do that

3114.96 --> 3120.88
you don't know how good you're going to

3118.48 --> 3124.28
be and you're going to be like trying to

3120.88 --> 3124.28
defend your Turf then

3126.24 --> 3131.839
there I never thought of becoming a

3128.92 --> 3134.319
Linguistics professor as like something

3131.839 --> 3134.319
that I could

3141.52 --> 3147.72
do or maybe the idea that I would

3144.04 --> 3147.72
continually just be teach ing

3148.88 --> 3154.92
foreigners like my language maybe that

3152.48 --> 3154.92
put me

3156.839 --> 3162.52
off I don't

3159.16 --> 3165.799
know I didn't really I didn't see things

3162.52 --> 3169.16
like more realistically like I know now

3165.799 --> 3171.68
I did not have a very cohesive logical

3169.16 --> 3175.319
picture of what the world was like back

3171.68 --> 3177.16
then like 20 years ago like at all I I

3175.319 --> 3181.24
knew what was directly around me but the

3177.16 --> 3185.5589999999997
rest was all like I I didn't understand

3181.24 --> 3188.64
all that at all like it was mysterious

3185.559 --> 3191.48
and scary to me like I I would try to

3188.64 --> 3195.5589999999997
form like a cohesive view of

3191.48 --> 3199.599
it but it would all be projection from

3195.559 --> 3202.079
how I would do it basic I couldn't

3199.599 --> 3204.6400000000003
figure it out how people were out there

3202.079 --> 3207.1600000000003
it was all alien to me I get it much

3204.64 --> 3207.16
better now

3210.92 --> 3215.52
although I'm still not like exactly a

3212.88 --> 3215.52
master of

3217.359 --> 3223.24
it I'm saying is I would have probably

3220.16 --> 3226.3999999999996
not have been very good at it 20 years

3223.24 --> 3229.359
ago at all I would have had like

3226.4 --> 3231.599
stumbling awkwardness a

3229.359 --> 3234.2799999999997
lot like

3231.599 --> 3236.1600000000003
frustration shame issue what it would

3234.28 --> 3238.88
have just been too I would have been a

3236.16 --> 3241.1189999999997
really [ __ ] annoying teacher man like

3238.88 --> 3244.119
I it doesn't feel good when I try to

3241.119 --> 3244.119
simulate it in my

3244.64 --> 3251.16
mind but now it's like hey it's

3248.319 --> 3253.96
something that I could help somebody

3251.16 --> 3256.1189999999997
with

3253.96 --> 3260.2400000000002
right I

3256.119 --> 3262.359
like guys because of the way I live and

3260.24 --> 3266.359
because I've

3262.359 --> 3267.92
basically in ways disengaged with like

3266.359 --> 3271.359
the labor

3267.92 --> 3273.44
world I've just become about developing

3271.359 --> 3276.319
skills like that has always that's

3273.44 --> 3279.96
become my strategy and I like try to

3276.319 --> 3283.7599999999998
build and collect and refine skills and

3279.96 --> 3286.92
then I can help people out with

3283.76 --> 3290.2400000000002
that like I can give it as an example or

3286.92 --> 3293.92
an idea for them right when they need it

3290.24 --> 3297.0789999999997
and that does actually work guys that

3293.92 --> 3297.079
really does work

3298.48 --> 3302.64
you just have to wait for the right time

3301.28 --> 3304.6400000000003
and the right

3302.64 --> 3306.359
place when they're ready for it then

3304.64 --> 3308.52
they feel and they'll have a pulling and

3306.359 --> 3310.119
I'll say it and it'll be exactly what

3308.52 --> 3312.92
they

3310.119 --> 3315.04
need and they'll have a adorable

3312.92 --> 3317.2000000000003
structured insight about it that they

3315.04 --> 3320.24
can carry with them and use as a

3317.2 --> 3321.5989999999997
foundation and further develop it on the

3320.24 --> 3323.52
very

3321.599 --> 3327.079
sound

3323.52 --> 3328.72
fractally perfect almost like fractal

3327.079 --> 3331.559
thinking

3328.72 --> 3334.72
applicable durable Foundation like a

3331.559 --> 3339.28
thing that like could carry a lot of

3334.72 --> 3342.2799999999997
weight of right that's what I try to

3339.28 --> 3342.28
do

3342.92 --> 3349.16
metaphysically give people

3345.44 --> 3351.599
these like durable ideas that even when

3349.16 --> 3353.48
you're still you don't know yet you can

3351.599 --> 3356.2400000000002
keep carrying them with them and then

3353.48 --> 3358.88
over time they turn out to like be very

3356.24 --> 3363.359
durable that's what I want to

3358.88 --> 3363.359
do that's what I how I want to help

3369.16 --> 3376.0
people yeah we

3372.119 --> 3380.6800000000003
need mental climate

3376.0 --> 3380.68
change we need more durable

3381.799 --> 3389.0389999999998
thinking we need to abandon

3385.799 --> 3389.0389999999998
chasing after

3389.119 --> 3396.76
Illusions start bottom up with more

3393.039 --> 3396.76
durable foundational

3398.64 --> 3403.5989999999997
thinking psychological warfare is so

3401.559 --> 3406.599
prevalent it's like we

3403.599 --> 3410.599
can't we can't carry

3406.599 --> 3413.0
on the way that people have done things

3410.599 --> 3413.0
before

3413.28 --> 3422.0
this you can't be psychologically

3417.28 --> 3426.119
dependent on outside forces like that

3422.0 --> 3426.119
anymore it's too dangerous

3426.24 --> 3429.24
now

3429.92 --> 3436.48
anyway I have no idea what if you guys

3432.28 --> 3436.48
are follow what what are you talking

3443.799 --> 3446.799
about

3473.799 --> 3476.799
for

3487.68 --> 3492.52
I don't know who I was talking to just

3489.72 --> 3496.0389999999998
now in the last five 10 minutes but it

3492.52 --> 3496.0389999999998
certainly doesn't seem to be the

3503.72 --> 3506.72
chat

3533.72 --> 3536.72
for

3555.0 --> 3558.039
just add a bit of

3560.799 --> 3566.64
word this is like the word spiritual

3563.64 --> 3566.64
metadata

3569.96 --> 3580.119
it's like a science fiction word

3573.52 --> 3580.119
that's like just it works it just

3582.2 --> 3589.48
works and it's also

3585.72 --> 3592.359
just by the the combination of the word

3589.48 --> 3597.839
spiritual and metadata it

3592.359 --> 3599.839
like it in a way shows that spirituality

3597.839 --> 3604.2
can

3599.839 --> 3605.799
be seen as mechanisms just like why I

3604.2 --> 3609.0789999999997
say Spirit

3605.799 --> 3609.96
mechanics it I it is a mechanistic thing

3609.079 --> 3614.4
in a

3609.96 --> 3617.4
way it's just Consciousness and

3614.4 --> 3617.4
energy

3619.2 --> 3623.359
right instead of gears and

3623.559 --> 3626.559
forces

3646.4 --> 3650.76
what GB

3651.119 --> 3656.52
what what's the why is there a second B

3654.24 --> 3656.52
there

3665.119 --> 3669.48
duper isn't that supposed to be an

3677.76 --> 3686.44
H why did you put a b instead of an H

3683.44 --> 3686.44
Doer

3705.52 --> 3709.4
this is kind of

3713.44 --> 3716.44
ridiculous

3738.24 --> 3741.5589999999997
okay yeah by the way thanks stey

3739.839 --> 3743.359
traveler you are at least listening to

3741.559 --> 3746.3590000000004
me that's

3743.359 --> 3746.359
great

3746.4 --> 3752.92
it's just that having a bunch of little

3749.559 --> 3755.2000000000003
children just talking about silly

3752.92 --> 3758.4
[ __ ] like

3755.2 --> 3760.64
literally saying out loud the alphabet

3758.4 --> 3762.279
like right next to me basically is kind

3760.64 --> 3766.52
of distracting when you're like trying

3762.279 --> 3770.039
to talk about complicated metaphysical

3766.52 --> 3773.2
things like like oh yeah yeah actually

3770.039 --> 3774.6800000000003
like Consciousness and spirit and

3773.2 --> 3777.359
understanding and dealing with the

3774.68 --> 3779.72
information is kind of like a

3777.359 --> 3783.7599999999998
machine it's like a

3779.72 --> 3786.359
computer or actually probably the entire

3783.76 --> 3792.6800000000003
idea of a computer is based

3786.359 --> 3792.68
originally on an understanding of

3793.24 --> 3799.72
communication so like computer is

3795.48 --> 3799.72
basically like electronic communication

3803.279 --> 3806.279
internally

3807.2 --> 3813.0389999999998
like what it does it's like energy

3820.0 --> 3825.079
structures like information switching

3822.96 --> 3828.799
back and forth back and

3825.079 --> 3831.279
forth every switch has a bit of energy

3828.799 --> 3833.7599999999998
how do they

3831.279 --> 3836.72
then like energy gets in the way of

3833.76 --> 3839.92
other energy so then it's like how do

3836.72 --> 3843.5589999999997
you what is the optimal way to put as

3839.92 --> 3847.2000000000003
many nodes of switching back and forth

3843.559 --> 3850.599
in ways in a structure that like the

3847.2 --> 3852.839
energy actually supports everything

3850.599 --> 3857.2400000000002
costing less energy and doesn't like

3852.839 --> 3860.16
balast anything costing more right and

3857.24 --> 3860.16
then you get all

3863.2 --> 3869.0789999999997
that and I find that very

3866.44 --> 3870.16
interesting it's because that's just

3869.079 --> 3873.6800000000003
like

3870.16 --> 3875.68
how people work too in spirit it's like

3873.68 --> 3878.44
that's what you do in the virtual realm

3875.68 --> 3881.52
in your with your mind a lot of it is

3878.44 --> 3883.2400000000002
just automated it's not even you don't

3881.52 --> 3885.0
get to even actually consciously go

3883.24 --> 3886.7599999999998
through the process with some people it

3885.0 --> 3889.72
just happens in the background and then

3886.76 --> 3889.7200000000003
it's brought to their

3892.2 --> 3898.96
attention subconscious can be like

3895.96 --> 3898.96
unfathomably

3899.359 --> 3905.44
quick I think that a human mind can be

3902.48 --> 3908.68
like way quicker than any

3905.44 --> 3912.96
computer but computers

3908.68 --> 3916.48
are F like phenomenally better at

3912.96 --> 3918.68
organizing complicated large amounts of

3916.48 --> 3920.52
information that's the big difference

3918.68 --> 3922.68
that's the big Talent

3920.52 --> 3924.68
difference that's what computers are so

3922.68 --> 3927.799
amazing at at like

3924.68 --> 3930.48
piles and piles and piles and piles of

3927.799 --> 3933.559
stuff and processing it yeah that's

3930.48 --> 3936.44
really tedious for a m but a human

3933.559 --> 3940.4
single human being can just

3936.44 --> 3944.079
like see structures that just like that

3940.4 --> 3947.48
are they just they're just instantly

3944.079 --> 3949.88
there it's like the idea of quantum

3947.48 --> 3953.119
Computing like oh you don't know all it

3949.88 --> 3956.359
has they it just knows right that's a

3953.119 --> 3958.6800000000003
myth that is very likely based on like

3956.359 --> 3962.119
the inspiration of how a human actually

3958.68 --> 3964.799
works it's like you look at it you just

3962.119 --> 3968.799
know it it's like

3964.799 --> 3973.599
this yeah computers can't do that ever

3968.799 --> 3978.119
but they can process absurd amounts of

3973.599 --> 3978.119
data which is very tedious for a human

3980.839 --> 3984.68
being right you just gave him basic

3983.2 --> 3987.0
instructions

3984.68 --> 3991.48
filters and they just like throw it

3987.0 --> 3993.64
through just on an industrial level no

3991.48 --> 3996.72
strain

3993.64 --> 3999.68
really for a human that's very

3996.72 --> 4002.52
strenuous but a computer really can only

3999.68 --> 4004.279
process things like the through the

4002.52 --> 4007.44
filters they've been

4004.279 --> 4010.799
provided on how to do

4007.44 --> 4014.039
that right they can't be

4010.799 --> 4016.0
imaginative about anything humans can

4014.039 --> 4018.279
can and can

4016.0 --> 4023.4
instantaneously see something that's

4018.279 --> 4023.4
just like a computer could never figure

4031.319 --> 4037.4
out who Foster than the human mind yeah

4034.359 --> 4040.24
but only can only do as they've been

4037.4 --> 4042.52
taught to do Ranna Johnson I know what

4040.24 --> 4046.5589999999997
I'm talking about

4042.52 --> 4048.359
here yeah yeah infinitely quick but they

4046.559 --> 4051.1600000000003
have no will and they have no

4048.359 --> 4053.119
imagination like if they were conscious

4051.16 --> 4055.1189999999997
they would immediately self-destruct

4053.119 --> 4058.7200000000003
because they have so much capacity and

4055.119 --> 4060.2000000000003
so much time they literally with a

4058.72 --> 4061.52
actual Consciousness that could be

4060.2 --> 4064.799
creative would know what to do with

4061.52 --> 4067.0
thems they'd instantly

4064.799 --> 4069.799
self-destruct it's probably happened in

4067.0 --> 4075.92
the past when they tried something with

4069.799 --> 4075.92
that to simulate an actual mind

4076.799 --> 4081.72
if an actual mind simulated would become

4079.16 --> 4084.52
truly conscious and self sustaining like

4081.72 --> 4084.52
it would try to

4088.88 --> 4094.2400000000002
self-destruct creativity is expression

4091.799 --> 4097.48
yeah but it's not just

4094.24 --> 4100.199
expression a creative mind is also like

4097.48 --> 4105.839
being able to see

4100.199 --> 4105.839
structures or the future of something

4109.319 --> 4117.080000000001
there are things that people's minds can

4111.88 --> 4117.08
do that only people's minds can

4117.799 --> 4126.12
do and without it there's

4121.199 --> 4128.879999999999
no real Visionary

4126.12 --> 4131.3589999999995
development because it's especially that

4128.88 --> 4133.56
that aspect is the most predominant of

4131.359 --> 4135.56
the human influence is it's the vision

4133.56 --> 4138.679
it's people that

4135.56 --> 4142.080000000001
Envision like really durable

4138.679 --> 4146.359
settings for the future that are

4142.08 --> 4149.44
then they're applied and then into the

4146.359 --> 4151.759
future it turns out it was great and it

4149.44 --> 4154.678999999999
was

4151.759 --> 4158.319
like like oh it turns out that was like

4154.679 --> 4160.159
almost perfect but like he didn't go far

4158.319 --> 4162.719
enough right that's usually how that

4160.159 --> 4165.96
goes but the point is is that they did

4162.719 --> 4169.719
have the vision and come true in many

4165.96 --> 4174.0
ways just like the flip phone from Star

4169.719 --> 4176.4800000000005
Trek the first series it's like yeah

4174.0 --> 4179.64
yeah that actually happened and they

4176.48 --> 4181.08
call it way before it's exactly a flip

4179.64 --> 4185.04
phone that's what it

4181.08 --> 4188.4
is right that didn't exist at all I mean

4185.04 --> 4190.6
in in the 80s you were lucky to have

4188.4 --> 4194.36
like these giant box

4190.6 --> 4200.320000000001
telephones yeah Star Trek called flip

4194.36 --> 4201.32
phones in the 60s okay that's Vision

4200.32 --> 4205.5599999999995
that's

4201.32 --> 4208.679
like a computer can't do

4205.56 --> 4211.320000000001
that a computer can't

4208.679 --> 4214.159
predict what will be

4211.32 --> 4216.28
possible before it is within the range

4214.159 --> 4218.48
of possibilities to figure out that it

4216.28 --> 4218.48
could

4218.719 --> 4225.64
work a human can be me up hey s star

4223.44 --> 4225.639999999999
what

4225.76 --> 4230.360000000001
H yeah the be me up part that's kind of

4228.12 --> 4232.5599999999995
like they didn't call everything okay

4230.36 --> 4235.639999999999
teleportation is like one of the most

4232.56 --> 4235.64
ridiculous ideas

4242.0 --> 4246.6
ever so yeah that's

4250.44 --> 4256.759999999999
that like the actual logical impact that

4254.4 --> 4259.679
teleportation as it's conceived of in

4256.76 --> 4264.159000000001
Star Trek would have on society is

4259.679 --> 4268.4800000000005
that it would totally destroy every

4264.159 --> 4270.5199999999995
conception of human identity because I

4268.48 --> 4272.5599999999995
the teleportation device is freaking

4270.52 --> 4275.4800000000005
insane

4272.56 --> 4278.4800000000005
man like you can literally just clone

4275.48 --> 4278.48
yourself just like

4279.56 --> 4286.96
thato like what do you mean he died who

4283.64 --> 4288.679
who cares we just summon the last

4286.96 --> 4292.6
version stored in the

4288.679 --> 4295.0
database it's like yeah they don't

4292.6 --> 4297.159000000001
actually tell that about anything about

4295.0 --> 4300.76
it like yeah if actually that worked

4297.159 --> 4303.04
then it's like what do you mean

4300.76 --> 4306.360000000001
procreation we just

4303.04 --> 4308.6
summon the best optimal version of the

4306.36 --> 4312.599999999999
person in their

4308.6 --> 4315.2390000000005
Prime we just summon them it's like okay

4312.6 --> 4318.320000000001
you just find the right age of a certain

4315.239 --> 4321.28
person when they're optimal you beef

4318.32 --> 4325.599999999999
them up a little bit extra then you like

4321.28 --> 4328.84
read them you do the deepest possible

4325.6 --> 4331.76
scan yeah like the highest grade form of

4328.84 --> 4334.56
teleportation information storage and

4331.76 --> 4336.8
then like yeah that person is now

4334.56 --> 4339.88
effectively Immortal for as long as his

4336.8 --> 4341.56
module or their module is stored within

4339.88 --> 4344.2390000000005
within a computer somewhere and it could

4341.56 --> 4346.1990000000005
just be resummoned or could literally

4344.239 --> 4350.48
create an entire Army out of those

4346.199 --> 4352.32
people like on a win like in a matter of

4350.48 --> 4354.678999999999
like half an hour you could like summon

4352.32 --> 4359.88
a hundred of them like

4354.679 --> 4364.92
bro teleportation total insane totally

4359.88 --> 4364.92
insane Tech not addressed

4367.48 --> 4372.638999999999
properly Star Trek

4370.4 --> 4374.199
ridiculous and that's assuming that it's

4372.639 --> 4375.28
even a possib

4374.199 --> 4378.839999999999
which it

4375.28 --> 4381.239
isn't yeah life is not just because the

4378.84 --> 4383.88
whole philosophy about teleportation is

4381.239 --> 4386.04
that the spirit and Consciousness is

4383.88 --> 4388.6
just the side effect of the arrangement

4386.04 --> 4391.159
of the matter yeah that's not what it is

4388.6 --> 4393.679
yeah you disintegrate the person you

4391.159 --> 4396.28
teleport them who's to say that the

4393.679 --> 4399.04
Consciousness is just going to flip to

4396.28 --> 4402.04
the other body like that it's much more

4399.04 --> 4406.56
likely it's like yeah you're

4402.04 --> 4410.6
dead life body drops on the floor

4406.56 --> 4414.56
yeah the Consciousness just doesn't like

4410.6 --> 4416.639
oh unless they would specifically have

4414.56 --> 4419.320000000001
figured out that Consciousness is

4416.639 --> 4421.76
actually a thing and then in the

4419.32 --> 4425.639
teleportation process account for it

4421.76 --> 4429.08
like a special

4425.639 --> 4432.28
like energy deflection specifically for

4429.08 --> 4434.96
the spirit or like it would have to be

4432.28 --> 4438.719
accounted for in some way but the whole

4434.96 --> 4440.96
materialistic view of it is just like oh

4438.719 --> 4443.4800000000005
you're just the Consciousness is just a

4440.96 --> 4445.4
side effect of your flesh it's just a

4443.48 --> 4447.239
side effect right the stupid atheist

4445.4 --> 4449.44
thinking from back then that that was

4447.239 --> 4453.08
all back then was really prevalent oh

4449.44 --> 4455.159
we're so special oh Evolution and oh

4453.08 --> 4457.719
we're just the smartest ones and just

4455.159 --> 4460.12
conscious is just a side effect yeah and

4457.719 --> 4462.2390000000005
then telep yeah you disintegrate the

4460.12 --> 4463.599999999999
hump of Flesh and you recreate the hump

4462.239 --> 4465.12
of Flesh somewhere else and the

4463.6 --> 4468.8
Consciousness just

4465.12 --> 4470.679
reemerges right with all the memory and

4468.8 --> 4472.76
something they didn't know what they

4470.679 --> 4476.28
were talking

4472.76 --> 4476.280000000001
about it can't

4476.719 --> 4485.56
work the entire idea of tation is absurd

4481.48 --> 4486.48
and will grow ever more absurd as time

4485.56 --> 4488.1990000000005
keeps

4486.48 --> 4492.28
passing

4488.199 --> 4495.04
right now on the other

4492.28 --> 4500.239
hand

4495.04 --> 4502.679
wormholes are actually quite quite into

4500.239 --> 4506.718999999999
the range of possibilities for whatever

4502.679 --> 4509.1990000000005
that is right because it's of course

4506.719 --> 4513.2390000000005
Very Much convoluted with the bending of

4509.199 --> 4517.159
space time understanding in black

4513.239 --> 4519.32
holes and worm holes yeah but I mean the

4517.159 --> 4522.159
idea of wormholes is just

4519.32 --> 4523.92
like this piece of space connected to

4522.159 --> 4526.638999999999
that piece of space

4523.92 --> 4530.679
you bend it

4526.639 --> 4534.8
somehow yeah I mean I think that is

4530.679 --> 4537.76
already intricately there it's like the

4534.8 --> 4542.12
possibility of that in my opinion is

4537.76 --> 4545.719
very high because it's a standard effect

4542.12 --> 4548.679
that is happening in the realm it's like

4545.719 --> 4551.92
we live in a looping

4548.679 --> 4556.0
Wormhole effectively like that effect

4551.92 --> 4558.1990000000005
however that is is there so if it's

4556.0 --> 4561.32
already there as a standard part of the

4558.199 --> 4566.638999999999
design of physical existence

4561.32 --> 4569.599999999999
here then why wouldn't it be possible to

4566.639 --> 4572.92
tap into that mechanism somehow and

4569.6 --> 4575.1990000000005
basically use it to jump from one point

4572.92 --> 4575.1990000000005
to

4576.159 --> 4580.759999999999
another

4578.159 --> 4585.12
directly I think the chances of that is

4580.76 --> 4585.12
very high and so part

4585.84 --> 4592.76
teleportal right is very likely to

4591.12 --> 4595.0
eventually

4592.76 --> 4596.360000000001
happen if it's not already secretly

4595.0 --> 4599.639
being used I mean there's already

4596.36 --> 4603.44
stories about oh who we had a gate and

4599.639 --> 4605.2390000000005
then walked into it and then really un

4603.44 --> 4607.239
terrible feeling and then we were like

4605.239 --> 4610.5199999999995
on the other side of the United States

4607.239 --> 4614.44
at the base there's stories about that

4610.52 --> 4616.040000000001
already now are they true I don't know

4614.44 --> 4618.678999999999
but

4616.04 --> 4622.4
logically not of like oh what did that

4618.679 --> 4625.08
really happen no just

4622.4 --> 4627.44
logically it is much more likely that

4625.08 --> 4629.36
that is something that can be done and

4627.44 --> 4631.44
will be done eventually will

4629.36 --> 4633.759999999999
unfortunately also be used for military

4631.44 --> 4637.12
purposes just like suddenly an entire

4633.76 --> 4639.08
Army just man like walks out of a gate

4637.12 --> 4641.76
in the middle of a city basically

4639.08 --> 4643.679
terrible in that sense

4641.76 --> 4645.8
but if

4643.679 --> 4648.04
actually seeing some things in my

4645.8 --> 4652.6
vision but

4648.04 --> 4656.04
yeah that is way more likely than o

4652.6 --> 4658.280000000001
disintegrate and then project a rem

4656.04 --> 4660.28
manifestation

4658.28 --> 4665.32
somehow

4660.28 --> 4667.639
to reintegrate material and life at a

4665.32 --> 4670.5599999999995
distance

4667.639 --> 4673.56
absurd totally

4670.56 --> 4674.96
ridiculous only gets more ridicul listed

4673.56 --> 4677.8
more time

4674.96 --> 4683.159
passes but

4677.8 --> 4686.56
yeah a teleportal a gate system that is

4683.159 --> 4688.48
actually very likely to at some point

4686.56 --> 4692.719
just happen and they might even keep

4688.48 --> 4695.638999999999
this a secret forever like telep portals

4692.719 --> 4699.199
might become like standardized State

4695.639 --> 4701.96
Secrets like governments will get access

4699.199 --> 4703.678999999999
to it like a Stargate but they'll just

4701.96 --> 4706.28
keep it secret from from the public it

4703.679 --> 4707.8
will like never be admitted but they can

4706.28 --> 4711.5199999999995
just use

4707.8 --> 4713.719
that so they have like a logistical

4711.52 --> 4716.719
advantage over the people that the

4713.719 --> 4720.639
people aren't aware of I mean in a way

4716.719 --> 4723.04
they'd be crazy to just declassify that

4720.639 --> 4725.96
they'd have that kind of

4723.04 --> 4729.32
Technology because people will start to

4725.96 --> 4732.719
demand that it be utilized in their own

4729.32 --> 4735.159
personal Advantage it's like yeah we

4732.719 --> 4739.44
don't don't want to get in the car and

4735.159 --> 4741.839999999999
stand in traffic jams we want to use the

4739.44 --> 4743.799999999999
portal that's what's going to happen and

4741.84 --> 4747.4400000000005
that's why they probably don't really

4743.8 --> 4750.28
want to declassify it if it's already

4747.44 --> 4753.48
actually figured out how to do that and

4750.28 --> 4755.92
not just a bluff to amuse us and

4753.48 --> 4755.919999999999
distract

4761.84 --> 4764.84
us

4791.84 --> 4794.84
that's

4809.73 --> 4812.889999999999
[Applause]

4821.76 --> 4824.76
that

4842.679 --> 4846.84
yeah I'm changing up

4844.52 --> 4849.679
the the title a

4846.84 --> 4852.4800000000005
bit make some

4849.679 --> 4854.84
room so now it's Linguistics instead of

4852.48 --> 4856.48
music music spiritual metadata and telep

4854.84 --> 4859.12
portals I really wanted the telep

4856.48 --> 4859.12
portals in

4873.05 --> 4876.26
[Music]

4881.639 --> 4884.639
there

4893.56 --> 4898.360000000001
what ah see Star what is you're talking

4896.04 --> 4898.36
about

4906.12 --> 4910.76
dear do you think the controllers know

4908.8 --> 4913.76
how the looping earth works and are

4910.76 --> 4915.4800000000005
creating portals I think that the

4913.76 --> 4917.56
controllers are

4915.48 --> 4920.28
too

4917.56 --> 4922.56
distracted by their own grabbling to

4920.28 --> 4925.4
actually know I don't

4922.56 --> 4928.84
think I think they have the real

4925.4 --> 4931.239
controllers fear knowledge like that

4928.84 --> 4933.92
like they they probably are too

4931.239 --> 4935.28
dependent on their delusions just to to

4933.92 --> 4939.52
keep their own

4935.28 --> 4941.5599999999995
sanity whatever's left of it so no I

4939.52 --> 4944.56
don't think the controllers know how it

4941.56 --> 4944.56
works

4948.28 --> 4952.5199999999995
there might be certain researchers that

4951.6 --> 4956.4400000000005
do

4952.52 --> 4959.92
know there might be

4956.44 --> 4964.159
like development

4959.92 --> 4967.28
research groups that have been utilized

4964.159 --> 4970.04
by controllers that might

4967.28 --> 4972.5599999999995
know but they're just

4970.04 --> 4975.28
like yeah we'll just keep that to our

4972.56 --> 4977.280000000001
ourselves thanks I mean if somebody

4975.28 --> 4979.84
comes in and asks we'll probably just

4977.28 --> 4983.5599999999995
say like yeah here here's

4979.84 --> 4988.4800000000005
it but they're just like not going

4983.56 --> 4990.76
to stroll around and show it off or

4988.48 --> 4993.959999999999
anything right they don't want to get in

4990.76 --> 4996.400000000001
the way of the globe Earth Lobby if you

4993.96 --> 4996.4
know what I

4997.239 --> 5001.839999999999
mean and they're definitely like oh man

4999.84 --> 5004.28
I really need to tell those flat

5001.84 --> 5005.56
earthers they got the wrong model or

5004.28 --> 5009.5199999999995
something

5005.56 --> 5012.88
like no like just don't get in the way

5009.52 --> 5014.56
of the globe Lobby and and you'll still

5012.88 --> 5017.56
have

5014.56 --> 5017.56
contracts

5018.12 --> 5024.599999999999
right just because they know doesn't

5020.52 --> 5024.6
mean that they're

5025.36 --> 5031.32
like at Liberty to just share it with

5031.48 --> 5034.48
everybody

5037.6 --> 5045.120000000001
but like controllers themselves no they

5040.6 --> 5045.120000000001
don't need to know those kind of

5054.56 --> 5057.56
things

5059.52 --> 5064.6
Island oh my God she did that is

5062.52 --> 5065.620000000001
ridiculous

5064.6 --> 5068.77
D

5065.62 --> 5068.7699999999995
[Music]

5070.8 --> 5079.96
wow what kind of an English teacher is

5075.36 --> 5082.839999999999
that I mean what unless it's like a

5079.96 --> 5086.0
really tenacious personal

5082.84 --> 5087.639
Quirk how the hell can you be an English

5086.0 --> 5088.8
teacher if you don't even know how to

5087.639 --> 5091.36
pronounce

5088.8 --> 5094.360000000001
Island

5091.36 --> 5094.36
what

5096.199 --> 5103.199
yeah crappy like was that some

5099.56 --> 5106.400000000001
like oh I'm not even going to go

5103.199 --> 5109.5199999999995
there it's maybe the new migran teacher

5106.4 --> 5109.5199999999995
or something I don't

5109.719 --> 5112.719
know

5116.88 --> 5121.28
ridiculous Russian she had an ex okay

5119.88 --> 5124.28
well then she's

5121.28 --> 5124.28
forgiven

5124.52 --> 5129.119000000001
because yeah English is actually kind of

5127.239 --> 5131.799999999999
tough for Russians

5129.119 --> 5133.4
so hey and I

5131.8 --> 5136.92
mean

5133.4 --> 5141.28
uh how many English people actually know

5136.92 --> 5143.0
how to even understand remotely Russian

5141.28 --> 5145.599999999999
okay

5143.0 --> 5147.52
so there's not going to be that many

5145.6 --> 5150.0
English people that are going to be well

5147.52 --> 5153.639
versed at Russian compared to how many

5150.0 --> 5156.199
Russians can actually understand it

5153.639 --> 5160.92
English because Russian is very

5156.199 --> 5160.919999999999
complicated and very very

5164.4 --> 5172.5199999999995
different or nameless oh go

5168.32 --> 5172.5199999999995
okay yep they got a few of

5174.52 --> 5180.76
those math teacher from

5177.76 --> 5180.76
Turkey

5181.199 --> 5184.199
okay

5211.199 --> 5214.199
for

5236.36 --> 5241.639
you didn't understand why you don't

5239.04 --> 5245.4
understand why she got mad hoer oh

5241.639 --> 5245.400000000001
because you felt embarrassed of

5255.76 --> 5262.360000000001
course but because in a way it is really

5258.88 --> 5266.32
embarrassing you know like the word

5262.36 --> 5269.239
island is going to be among like one of

5266.32 --> 5274.08
the first words you are going to

5269.239 --> 5278.0
learn in English very l logically why

5274.08 --> 5283.239
because England is an island it's going

5278.0 --> 5283.239
to come up there's no way to

5283.76 --> 5289.92
avoid getting confronted with the word

5286.84 --> 5292.719
Island very early on and like hey why

5289.92 --> 5293.96
isn't it Island yeah because it's

5292.719 --> 5295.92
pronounced

5293.96 --> 5297.08
islanding one of the first things you're

5295.92 --> 5302.76
going to

5297.08 --> 5306.719
learn right very bizarre that in a

5302.76 --> 5310.0
teacher wouldn't know that that is like

5306.719 --> 5310.0
surreal to

5320.6 --> 5326.159000000001
me to be fair yeah hey to be fair to be

5323.88 --> 5328.119
fair yeah that's so cute but the point

5326.159 --> 5330.5199999999995
is it's one of the first things you are

5328.119 --> 5334.0
going to learn in

5330.52 --> 5334.0
English it doesn't

5334.32 --> 5340.0
matter it doesn't matter it's weird yeah

5337.639 --> 5341.52
sure it is but it's going to be one of

5340.0 --> 5343.48
the very first things that you're going

5341.52 --> 5345.4400000000005
to learn in the English language so it's

5343.48 --> 5349.36
really bizarre for a teacher to get that

5345.44 --> 5349.36
wrong really really

5349.44 --> 5354.799999999999
bizarre to the the point where I if I'd

5352.76 --> 5357.1990000000005
witnessed that I would immediately

5354.8 --> 5358.639
started drawing question whether they're

5357.199 --> 5362.96
actually an English

5358.639 --> 5365.84
teacher for real it's like sounds like

5362.96 --> 5368.679
somebody has been messing with the

5365.84 --> 5368.679
resume

5369.96 --> 5372.96
perhaps

5374.8 --> 5378.679
seriously so but

5386.239 --> 5390.0
whatever so let's move

5390.92 --> 5393.92
on

5394.96 --> 5399.119
are we all liking the show it's very

5396.639 --> 5403.0
language orientated

5399.119 --> 5403.0
today and a bit of Star

5411.92 --> 5418.679
Trek yes duper we get it we talked about

5416.119 --> 5420.839999999999
it for like 15 minutes okay can we move

5418.679 --> 5423.84
on

5420.84 --> 5423.84
now

5429.239 --> 5436.44
this freaking popups

5431.719 --> 5436.44
man just keep doing it

5450.84 --> 5457.0
stop

5453.04 --> 5457.0
the f is the only thing that isn't

5458.44 --> 5461.719
silent I don't

5469.8 --> 5476.639
know I'm not really even that interested

5472.6 --> 5478.159000000001
in like oh this effect about is in this

5476.639 --> 5480.76
but it's like I don't like the

5478.159 --> 5484.32
categorize effect it's just like when it

5480.76 --> 5484.320000000001
comes up I just want get it

5487.08 --> 5493.119
right I never even regard language is

5490.32 --> 5494.719
like oh this is the model of like oh

5493.119 --> 5497.4
this is always like this and this is

5494.719 --> 5500.88
always like that like I have no

5497.4 --> 5503.199
structure in my mind about that

5500.88 --> 5506.96
whatsoever that never worked on me the

5503.199 --> 5510.599999999999
only thing that works on me is I

5506.96 --> 5512.76
hear the and I keep listening to a

5510.6 --> 5515.679
better version to a better version a

5512.76 --> 5518.679
better version until like I just know

5515.679 --> 5520.56
this is the best way to say it this is

5518.679 --> 5522.2390000000005
slightly less this is slightly less this

5520.56 --> 5526.159000000001
is slightly less this is even worse that

5522.239 --> 5529.5599999999995
is even worse then I have a spectrum of

5526.159 --> 5532.879999999999
quality on how to say

5529.56 --> 5535.4800000000005
things just by confrontation and

5532.88 --> 5537.04
exposure and I always try to aim for the

5535.48 --> 5538.599999999999
highest thing I might not have the

5537.04 --> 5539.88
concentration and I'm going to settle

5538.6 --> 5542.56
for something

5539.88 --> 5547.6
less it's how I

5542.56 --> 5551.2390000000005
work there's a thousand options with

5547.6 --> 5554.639
everything available for use depending

5551.239 --> 5557.28
on how much control you have how stable

5554.639 --> 5560.88
you are how clear you

5557.28 --> 5564.0
are and if you are a little less then

5560.88 --> 5567.92
there's lower quality approaches that

5564.0 --> 5567.92
you can roll out that'll still work

5570.639 --> 5574.52
fine

5572.84 --> 5578.2390000000005
and that's how it

5574.52 --> 5581.280000000001
work but I mean that method of dealing

5578.239 --> 5584.718999999999
with the language only really works

5581.28 --> 5587.4
after you've already been just doing it

5584.719 --> 5591.84
and doing it and doing it forever it's

5587.4 --> 5595.199
not like oh this is the model on how to

5591.84 --> 5598.52
regard it starting off as a newbie you

5595.199 --> 5602.08
just memorize this thing and then you'll

5598.52 --> 5605.2390000000005
get really good really quick no I don't

5602.08 --> 5609.199
have a mechanism like

5605.239 --> 5612.44
that except for Universal dealing with

5609.199 --> 5612.44
information in

5612.8 --> 5619.08
general so yeah I'm not like oh the

5616.56 --> 5622.639
YouTube channel or here is how all the

5619.08 --> 5625.6
different pronunciations in an

5622.639 --> 5627.4400000000005
order this is what you need to remember

5625.6 --> 5632.719
if you learn this you always get it

5627.44 --> 5635.239
right no I am not like that like at all

5632.719 --> 5635.2390000000005
you might have

5641.48 --> 5649.159
noticed I'm more about like hey you want

5644.44 --> 5652.159
to understand what's going on in in a

5649.159 --> 5654.04
situation here's the models of approach

5652.159 --> 5656.92
for Spiritual

5654.04 --> 5662.4
metadata like the spirit mechanics I'm

5656.92 --> 5664.4800000000005
basically giving you within ah sub

5662.4 --> 5667.04
understanding

5664.48 --> 5671.159
subconscious giving you the models on

5667.04 --> 5672.5199999999995
how to see spiritual metadata and how to

5671.159 --> 5676.28
understand things through the lens of

5672.52 --> 5678.52
spiritual metadata as an over structure

5676.28 --> 5681.199
instead of just seeing information as

5678.52 --> 5684.040000000001
isolated information and needing to

5681.199 --> 5687.44
derive wider implications based on the

5684.04 --> 5687.44
content of the information

5690.48 --> 5693.48
itself

5698.32 --> 5702.679
right

5699.52 --> 5705.4800000000005
because when you say something it's not

5702.679 --> 5707.88
about what is there that is being said

5705.48 --> 5707.879999999999
it is

5707.92 --> 5712.719
about

5710.56 --> 5716.360000000001
what what's

5712.719 --> 5718.159
behind it what is being experienced by

5716.36 --> 5719.679
the person saying that what do they wish

5718.159 --> 5722.5199999999995
to

5719.679 --> 5726.52
achieve what are they

5722.52 --> 5730.080000000001
being how do they think they're changing

5726.52 --> 5733.400000000001
everything how much are they aware how

5730.08 --> 5737.36
much do they feel they're falling down

5733.4 --> 5743.719
or getting up all these energy

5737.36 --> 5745.92
modes mod yeah Modi I don't know

5743.719 --> 5747.6
modalities I don't know what you what to

5745.92 --> 5753.4
use energy

5747.6 --> 5753.400000000001
modalities of movements inside of people

5753.44 --> 5758.199
it's all

5754.84 --> 5760.28
there it's all there in between the

5758.199 --> 5762.759999999999
words because of how the words are

5760.28 --> 5767.08
arranged you start to

5762.76 --> 5767.08
see the modalities of

5767.28 --> 5774.88
people there's a reason why people

5770.0 --> 5777.88
arrange the words they do there's like

5774.88 --> 5780.88
typical strategies of formulation and

5777.88 --> 5782.719
then there's like periodic timings of a

5780.88 --> 5786.28
very specific specific

5782.719 --> 5788.8
sort and then if you like choose a

5786.28 --> 5791.119
certain way of manifestation people will

5788.8 --> 5793.76
then start to recognize like oh yeah

5791.119 --> 5796.159
that is that is exactly the timing of

5793.76 --> 5798.679
what that guy would do and you become

5796.159 --> 5802.96
really predictable and reliable in a

5798.679 --> 5806.36
good way because you always choose your

5802.96 --> 5808.119
time for it that becomes your time

5806.36 --> 5810.36
because that's the time you pick and

5808.119 --> 5814.48
that's not like a literal time on the

5810.36 --> 5816.639
clock if it's a certain point in the

5814.48 --> 5820.04
motion of

5816.639 --> 5821.96
things your timing within things

5820.04 --> 5824.48
happening and if you have a very

5821.96 --> 5827.2390000000005
specific moment that you choose in

5824.48 --> 5829.36
reflection of the whole thing moving

5827.239 --> 5832.04
then people will start to recognize like

5829.36 --> 5834.96
oh that is exactly how that person would

5832.04 --> 5837.96
say it exactly that time it's so typical

5834.96 --> 5837.96
it's your thing

5840.199 --> 5843.199
now

5844.32 --> 5846.639
your

5847.52 --> 5853.8
timing this is all spiritual metod this

5851.199 --> 5856.5599999999995
is what is behind it

5853.8 --> 5858.96
all behind what people

5856.56 --> 5860.52
say what are they

5858.96 --> 5863.36
like

5860.52 --> 5865.92
right in a way like text in a chat is

5863.36 --> 5865.92
only a

5866.84 --> 5871.0
representative beside the text they are

5869.28 --> 5875.44
going to have their own feelings and

5871.0 --> 5878.88
their own ideas and their own private

5875.44 --> 5880.44
thoughts that are probably not going to

5878.88 --> 5883.84
compose

5880.44 --> 5885.799999999999
themselves to how they are wanting to be

5883.84 --> 5887.8
represented so they keep them to

5885.8 --> 5888.679
themselves other sides of them that they

5887.8 --> 5892.8
keep

5888.679 --> 5892.8
secret that still drive

5893.84 --> 5899.8
them and all these things are all

5900.119 --> 5903.119
visible

5907.0 --> 5910.96
yeah what you think just because it's

5909.639 --> 5915.400000000001
text

5910.96 --> 5918.4
there that that you and what you do is

5915.4 --> 5918.4
invisible

5921.48 --> 5927.199
no if you

5924.04 --> 5930.119
connect with your conscience in any

5927.199 --> 5933.119
way you are

5930.119 --> 5933.119
visible

5933.36 --> 5937.799999999999
do I still think in Dutch or

5937.92 --> 5940.92
English

5942.84 --> 5948.679
English Dutch thinking is in a very

5945.88 --> 5948.679
different type of

5949.96 --> 5954.92
Rhythm if I'm going to go dutch I need

5952.52 --> 5959.1990000000005
to take my time a little bit more on

5954.92 --> 5959.1990000000005
average English is quicker for

5960.04 --> 5963.04
me

5965.48 --> 5971.759999999999
but if I hang around Dutch people and am

5969.239 --> 5974.5599999999995
forced to talk and listen to especially

5971.76 --> 5977.280000000001
more complicated Dutch I will eventually

5974.56 --> 5979.52
be completely turned around and thinking

5977.28 --> 5982.4
Dutch thoughts

5979.52 --> 5985.599
again like I did much more like say in

5982.4 --> 5988.199
my teens I was very Dutch thinking in my

5985.599 --> 5991.84
teens which would also accompass with

5988.199 --> 5993.799999999999
the different styles and the ways Dutch

5991.84 --> 5996.52
people socially compose themselves which

5993.8 --> 6000.639
are in a very specific type of

5996.52 --> 6002.4400000000005
ways types very specific types like it's

6000.639 --> 6005.119
actually very specific it's not random

6002.44 --> 6006.0
at all how Dutch people compose

6005.119 --> 6009.159
themselves

6006.0 --> 6010.88
socially but I'm not so much exposed to

6009.159 --> 6012.5199999999995
that because I don't really hang around

6010.88 --> 6014.679
with Dutch people and talk with them a

6012.52 --> 6017.56
lot I doesn't really

6014.679 --> 6020.04
happen I hang around English

6017.56 --> 6022.639
communicating people much more that's

6020.04 --> 6025.04
what we've been hanging around in the

6022.639 --> 6025.04
last

6025.84 --> 6032.719
decade but leave me talking with Dutch

6029.88 --> 6035.599
people and I will start to remember all

6032.719 --> 6035.599
the Dutch things

6037.36 --> 6043.32
again and be kind of nostalgic for it

6040.84 --> 6046.679
too because a lot of it has kind of been

6043.32 --> 6048.04
abandoned by certain people sjws like

6046.679 --> 6051.639
they

6048.04 --> 6054.0
abandon cultural details

6051.639 --> 6054.0
on

6054.08 --> 6061.92
purpose or they they were afraid of it

6058.28 --> 6065.4
like the typical dutchness in the

6061.92 --> 6067.719
average culture has

6065.4 --> 6071.0
diluted over the last two decades

6067.719 --> 6074.28
noticeably for me before that two

6071.0 --> 6077.599
decades ago like the amount of

6074.28 --> 6079.239
Dutch typical Dutch intense spirit and

6077.599 --> 6082.400000000001
all that was very

6079.239 --> 6084.598999999999
prevalent like it was RI it was thick

6082.4 --> 6088.44
there were people like being very very

6084.599 --> 6088.4400000000005
very Dutch out there a lot of

6088.56 --> 6096.360000000001
it it's been politically under siege for

6092.92 --> 6103.08
quite a while Under Siege by media too

6096.36 --> 6107.92
and it's like it's not like it was it's

6103.08 --> 6111.639
now the real Dutch spirit is like that's

6107.92 --> 6113.96
been chained down in ways been Ram down

6111.639 --> 6115.84
which is very contradictive to the

6113.96 --> 6117.96
rebellious nature of a lot of Dutch

6115.84 --> 6120.719
Spirit which Dutch have a lot of

6117.96 --> 6125.56
rebellion in them they don't like to be

6120.719 --> 6129.2390000000005
told what to do in that sense I'm very

6125.56 --> 6129.2390000000005
Dutch very very

6129.48 --> 6136.799999999999
Dutch in other senses I'm not very Dutch

6132.599 --> 6139.88
like my money yeah

6136.8 --> 6142.719
whatever I'm not very good with money

6139.88 --> 6145.119
and labor

6142.719 --> 6148.639
and that is not typically Dutch Dutch

6145.119 --> 6151.759999999999
are typically very good at

6148.639 --> 6155.36
that they're very

6151.76 --> 6155.360000000001
hardworking clever

6157.52 --> 6163.96
people from what I've seen at least in

6160.08 --> 6167.4
the past H but now like yeah it's still

6163.96 --> 6171.08
out there but it's been under siege

6167.4 --> 6172.44
overtly now culturally through media in

6171.08 --> 6176.84
politics

6172.44 --> 6179.04
and a whole new Freaky communist class

6176.84 --> 6182.4400000000005
has really risen

6179.04 --> 6183.5199999999995
up and like they they are all hellbent

6182.44 --> 6187.199
on

6183.52 --> 6190.360000000001
like we will rule over you and we will

6187.199 --> 6192.919999999999
destroy you as much as we need to to

6190.36 --> 6194.598999999999
accomplish absolute obedience from

6192.92 --> 6197.2390000000005
everybody that isn't

6194.599 --> 6199.679
us and that's kind of what's Happening

6197.239 --> 6201.839999999999
Now for a

6199.679 --> 6204.1990000000005
while

6201.84 --> 6205.56
and it's forcing the Dutch rebellious

6204.199 --> 6210.199
Spirit to

6205.56 --> 6215.92
really to get oldfashioned creative like

6210.199 --> 6215.919999999999
cultural gorilla gorilla Warfare

6216.119 --> 6221.639
cultural not actual hot Wars or

6222.119 --> 6228.5199999999995
anything and I still think that we can

6224.48 --> 6228.5199999999995
very much win this one

6229.679 --> 6233.96
but

6231.28 --> 6236.5599999999995
like there's clearly like a cultural

6233.96 --> 6237.96
Civil War thing kind of thing going in

6236.56 --> 6242.4400000000005
the Netherlands

6237.96 --> 6245.76
now there's not that free open very

6242.44 --> 6248.919999999999
Dutch stuff like that I'm used to from

6245.76 --> 6253.88
the 90s it's not here now all the

6248.92 --> 6259.08
television is all super hor

6253.88 --> 6259.08
horrific gay very very gay

6259.159 --> 6264.44
crap it's not just get everything just

6262.239 --> 6267.638999999999
oh migrants oh they're so good oh

6264.44 --> 6272.119
they're so poor oh we Dutch white are

6267.639 --> 6275.52
bad oh all that [ __ ]

6272.119 --> 6279.839999999999
it's it's so drenched in

6275.52 --> 6282.0
it like it's literally unescapable now

6279.84 --> 6284.719
there's nothing you can turn any

6282.0 --> 6286.84
television channel in Dutch you can't

6284.719 --> 6290.679
turn anyone any of them

6286.84 --> 6292.92
on without getting some kind of sjw

6290.679 --> 6295.32
message in there it's

6292.92 --> 6298.8
impossible it's so bad

6295.32 --> 6301.159
now there's nothing left there wasn't

6298.8 --> 6303.08
there in the '90s they actually had

6301.159 --> 6306.5599999999995
Dutch culture and they made effort and

6303.08 --> 6309.36
they were like trying to stimulate

6306.56 --> 6312.92
intelligence so was the BBC back then I

6309.36 --> 6317.08
mean font memories of like BBC Nature

6312.92 --> 6317.08
Documentaries back then very

6317.4 --> 6322.48
interesting like intellectually

6319.92 --> 6322.4800000000005
stimulating

6322.84 --> 6329.360000000001
well that's not there

6324.52 --> 6333.0
now check the BBC out now it's

6329.36 --> 6336.639
horrible it is like a

6333.0 --> 6336.639
communist pullit

6343.4 --> 6350.199
Bureau right and our nobilities are

6347.0 --> 6353.48
completely [ __ ] in England and here I

6350.199 --> 6356.759999999999
mean our supposed Queen is now literally

6353.48 --> 6361.119
just doing those gross

6356.76 --> 6365.639
gross speeches at WF it

6361.119 --> 6370.32
like she's not allowed to like in

6365.639 --> 6372.4800000000005
accordance to like the law what she's

6370.32 --> 6375.36
supposed to be doing as a queen like not

6372.48 --> 6378.799999999999
getting involved in politics like that

6375.36 --> 6383.96
she's just doing it anyway it's

6378.8 --> 6389.119000000001
all really disgusting and corrupt

6383.96 --> 6389.119
and really want that woman to be

6389.8 --> 6396.360000000001
deported like maybe we could just like

6393.04 --> 6399.32
give her to Malay or something how about

6396.36 --> 6401.5199999999995
that just send her back to Argentina

6399.32 --> 6404.599
like hey

6401.52 --> 6408.119000000001
Malay want to do anything with this

6404.599 --> 6408.119000000001
woman got any

6409.4 --> 6412.4
plans

6416.56 --> 6419.56
n

6424.08 --> 6428.96
whatever she's certainly not making

6426.92 --> 6432.2390000000005
herself beloved

6428.96 --> 6436.84
and turning into like

6432.239 --> 6440.44
a communist snob

6436.84 --> 6443.679
Champion I mean we have a whole snob

6440.44 --> 6445.159
nobility self-appointed nobility set of

6443.679 --> 6449.36
communist

6445.159 --> 6452.08
scumbags that are now just grabbing

6449.36 --> 6453.88
power all over Europe by the way and

6452.08 --> 6455.639
it's been happening for quite a while

6453.88 --> 6458.119
they're just mostly coming out of the

6455.639 --> 6461.32
shadows and just becoming very

6458.119 --> 6463.36
autocratic now about it where before

6461.32 --> 6465.88
it's just like oh no this is just how we

6463.36 --> 6468.08
feel we'll keep it to ourselves they

6465.88 --> 6471.36
they're just like openly

6468.08 --> 6474.639
abusing anything they can to

6471.36 --> 6474.639
reinforce their

6475.56 --> 6484.320000000001
methods their authority over everybody

6479.92 --> 6486.639
else and that's why you should never let

6484.32 --> 6489.119
socialists in this case you could say

6486.639 --> 6493.0
just socialists you should never ever

6489.119 --> 6496.0
allow them in any government

6493.0 --> 6496.0
positions

6499.239 --> 6502.239
ever

6522.52 --> 6527.040000000001
right I mean it's kind of similar to

6525.0 --> 6530.199
like oh what if we just like started

6527.04 --> 6532.08
reinforcing sodomy laws again like

6530.199 --> 6536.199
starting with government right it used

6532.08 --> 6536.199
to be illegal which was very

6540.56 --> 6548.360000000001
sensible no but it's so oldfashioned

6543.4 --> 6550.719
we've moved on how dare you yeah no how

6548.36 --> 6550.719
dare

6555.44 --> 6562.5599999999995
you how dare you take

6558.84 --> 6565.1990000000005
this this crap that

6562.56 --> 6568.679
far do I still identify as a

6565.199 --> 6568.678999999999
conservative communist

6569.36 --> 6574.799999999999
no well maybe the the point is

6572.119 --> 6579.0
conservative communist is kind

6574.8 --> 6581.4400000000005
of in the colloquial understanding of it

6579.0 --> 6584.84
it's it's

6581.44 --> 6587.919999999999
paradoxical it was kind of in that sense

6584.84 --> 6590.88
a joke very arnian joke to make I like

6587.92 --> 6594.8
it like that

6590.88 --> 6598.08
it's just that I

6594.8 --> 6600.88
like the idea of utilizing group

6598.08 --> 6604.199
Instinct in a collective

6600.88 --> 6608.599
way it's just that the objectives that

6604.199 --> 6611.919999999999
communism has used are all

6608.599 --> 6611.92
destructive and

6613.28 --> 6617.96
denationalizing what if you literally

6615.679 --> 6619.599
like the entire mechanism as it is

6617.96 --> 6622.44
that's going this way what if you just

6619.599 --> 6624.4400000000005
literally turn it ground

6622.44 --> 6627.119
180°

6624.44 --> 6630.799999999999
yeah so conservative

6627.119 --> 6633.5199999999995
communism what it actually means

6630.8 --> 6637.56
is anti-communism

6633.52 --> 6637.56
like exactly the

6639.239 --> 6645.239
opposite think about it that was the

6641.639 --> 6649.159000000001
idea it's like we collectively do

6645.239 --> 6651.718999999999
exactly the opposite like we all agree

6649.159 --> 6654.92
we all agree that communism is the

6651.719 --> 6657.599
devil's religion and so to do things

6654.92 --> 6661.4800000000005
right we don't follow this book that

6657.599 --> 6664.92
group no we just do exactly the opposite

6661.48 --> 6668.5599999999995
of everything communism stands for in

6664.92 --> 6672.56
every detail every conceivable

6668.56 --> 6676.2390000000005
detail exactly the opposite of all that

6672.56 --> 6679.4800000000005
and then you just collectively do

6676.239 --> 6681.199
that right it's like taking the red book

6679.48 --> 6685.44
and then

6681.199 --> 6685.44
writing exactly the opposite of

6686.119 --> 6691.239
it inverse

6689.079 --> 6694.36
communism that was kind of the idea

6691.239 --> 6694.36
behind it see me

6700.56 --> 6707.719
traveler right like anti Marxist

6704.92 --> 6710.119
communism you could call it CU that's

6707.719 --> 6712.159
really what it's about like the weird

6710.119 --> 6716.159
thing is about it all the communism

6712.159 --> 6722.199
isn't even the threatening part it's the

6716.159 --> 6722.199
Marxism that drives it that is so

6723.88 --> 6730.96
destructive that enslaves people that

6727.76 --> 6734.119000000001
takes away their roots and their

6730.96 --> 6735.599
selfreliance to make them dependent on

6734.119 --> 6738.799999999999
the monster

6735.599 --> 6741.599
state that is what is so horrendously

6738.8 --> 6744.719
destructive about Marxist

6741.599 --> 6746.96
communism but the idea of like we all

6744.719 --> 6750.639
have the same shared

6746.96 --> 6754.36
values and we collectively

6750.639 --> 6755.96
contribute is actually a great idea but

6754.36 --> 6758.32
I mean yeah you could say oh that's not

6755.96 --> 6760.28
communism that's just

6758.32 --> 6763.599
Liberty

6760.28 --> 6763.599
okay but I

6763.679 --> 6770.679
mean what yeah if it's liberty like that

6768.119 --> 6772.88
it only works in sparing occasions if

6770.679 --> 6774.719
you're lucky and then over time after

6772.88 --> 6776.4800000000005
like three generations everybody's too

6774.719 --> 6778.96
[ __ ] lazy to do anything and only

6776.48 --> 6780.678999999999
complains all day long and then you

6778.96 --> 6783.4800000000005
don't have anything you don't have

6780.679 --> 6786.1990000000005
cohesion so maybe

6783.48 --> 6789.119
communism would be slightly better then

6786.199 --> 6792.678999999999
because at least they are going to keep

6789.119 --> 6794.639
having people that step forward right

6792.679 --> 6796.96
the difference in a way is like no it's

6794.639 --> 6798.96
not just you're free to do the right

6796.96 --> 6800.679
thing it's like no you do the right

6798.96 --> 6804.2390000000005
thing or you pay

6800.679 --> 6806.1990000000005
price you contribute to society or you

6804.239 --> 6809.678999999999
pay a

6806.199 --> 6812.159
price that part of Communism is actually

6809.679 --> 6816.079
in my opinion a bit sensible But It's

6812.159 --> 6818.44
Tricky the problem is is like what is

6816.079 --> 6820.4
considered you the thing that you would

6818.44 --> 6823.239
have to do to contribute to society

6820.4 --> 6825.96
right a bunch of politically deranged

6823.239 --> 6827.839999999999
people in there and they will like make

6825.96 --> 6830.36
oh the only way you can contribute to

6827.84 --> 6832.52
society is by stripping your ball off or

6830.36 --> 6835.199
something yeah yeah that's the [ __ ]

6832.52 --> 6838.92
problem with Communism you can have

6835.199 --> 6842.598999999999
really deranged people determining what

6838.92 --> 6844.84
is good that's the [ __ ] problem

6842.599 --> 6847.119000000001
that's like the atheist problem that

6844.84 --> 6848.96
leads to that deranged people

6847.119 --> 6850.44
determining what is good and that is

6848.96 --> 6853.119
actually really destructive for

6850.44 --> 6854.598999999999
everything and makes everybody insane

6853.119 --> 6856.719
that's the

6854.599 --> 6860.679
problem but if

6856.719 --> 6864.88
you force God into it is like

6860.679 --> 6868.56
communism theist communism

6864.88 --> 6871.28
theist conservative nationalist

6868.56 --> 6873.320000000001
communism it's like everything that

6871.28 --> 6877.28
colloquially would oppose

6873.32 --> 6878.239
communism but the form could be the same

6877.28 --> 6883.5199999999995
it's

6878.239 --> 6887.879999999999
just exactly inside out

6883.52 --> 6891.119000000001
yeah it's the Communist

6887.88 --> 6894.52
Paladin versus the communist blacku

6891.119 --> 6896.32
which is communism what it is really

6894.52 --> 6899.2390000000005
evil

6896.32 --> 6901.5199999999995
dark

6899.239 --> 6905.079
selfish power

6901.52 --> 6907.4800000000005
hungry and then you take the entire form

6905.079 --> 6908.84
and do exactly the opposite that that is

6907.48 --> 6911.5599999999995
the

6908.84 --> 6913.88
Paladin it would still be the form of

6911.56 --> 6916.52
Communism it just be exactly the

6913.88 --> 6916.52
opposite in

6918.599 --> 6921.599
everything

6928.599 --> 6932.56
Anarchy would have been my guess no

6930.96 --> 6935.84
Anarchy is

6932.56 --> 6937.4800000000005
evil Anarchy is you can do whatever the

6935.84 --> 6939.639
hell you want and nobody's going to stop

6937.48 --> 6942.718999999999
you no matter how evil it

6939.639 --> 6946.2390000000005
is no

6942.719 --> 6946.2390000000005
thanks we need a

6947.92 --> 6953.36
government without it deranged people

6950.56 --> 6953.360000000001
can destroy

6963.239 --> 6966.239
everything

6969.28 --> 6975.04
so okay Native Americans well duber

6972.48 --> 6975.04
that's C

6976.48 --> 6983.0
meso Native American is not a r

6980.92 --> 6986.0
it's literally

6983.0 --> 6986.0
it

6987.44 --> 6993.159
yeah then

6990.639 --> 6996.679
yeah Arab

6993.159 --> 6999.638999999999
African I mean dude there's like really

6996.679 --> 7002.36
distinctly different forms of

6999.639 --> 7006.639
Asian I mean have you ever compared a

7002.36 --> 7010.639
Mongolian to like somebody from Sri

7006.639 --> 7013.0
Lanka that's not the same race bro

7010.639 --> 7013.0
not at

7013.159 --> 7020.119
all there like almost exactly the

7017.119 --> 7022.239
opposite in every conceivable

7020.119 --> 7024.36
way like

7022.239 --> 7027.28
Mongolian Sri

7024.36 --> 7030.799999999999
Lankan exactly the opposite yeah yet

7027.28 --> 7033.88
they both live on the Asian continent on

7030.8 --> 7036.0
the mainland no less oh wait now Sri

7033.88 --> 7038.400000000001
Lanka is an island right next to yeah

7036.0 --> 7041.4
you you get my

7038.4 --> 7041.4
point

7042.44 --> 7048.48
think they own all stem from the main no

7044.679 --> 7052.32
they don't duper you're wrong there's

7048.48 --> 7056.5599999999995
many different original races that have

7052.32 --> 7058.639
like crossed over there is hybrid

7056.56 --> 7061.76
races a lot of

7058.639 --> 7065.28
them that are like their own

7061.76 --> 7065.280000000001
culture because of

7068.04 --> 7074.5199999999995
that but I I mean Asia alone has like

7071.88 --> 7078.1990000000005
very distinctly

7074.52 --> 7082.4400000000005
different races that have been like been

7078.199 --> 7085.32
there for a while very

7082.44 --> 7088.32
different like it's a

7085.32 --> 7088.32
big

7088.88 --> 7092.52
big slab of

7092.88 --> 7101.32
land it took people like multiple life

7097.52 --> 7101.320000000001
times just to cross it

7102.079 --> 7109.44
okay there's just no

7105.159 --> 7112.079
way it's just one race ridiculous sorry

7109.44 --> 7112.079
it's not

7114.52 --> 7120.040000000001
that and it's not even like even if you

7117.679 --> 7121.92
say like oh all the brown people are all

7120.04 --> 7124.679
related no they're

7121.92 --> 7126.119
not you have brown people in this place

7124.679 --> 7128.32
and then you have brown people in that

7126.119 --> 7130.0
place and they look very

7128.32 --> 7133.679
different

7130.0 --> 7136.4
yeah like mid African

7133.679 --> 7140.4
Africans like with the big noses and the

7136.4 --> 7143.36
really black and the lips look

7140.4 --> 7147.32
completely different from

7143.36 --> 7150.4
like a Sri Lankan or an Indian their

7147.32 --> 7152.5599999999995
Brown look completely different totally

7150.4 --> 7156.36
different

7152.56 --> 7159.84
yeah but they're brown it's it's not the

7156.36 --> 7162.96
same at all yeah Indians don't have the

7159.84 --> 7166.679
poooky lips and the and the noses like

7162.96 --> 7169.119
that and different complexion different

7166.679 --> 7173.28
type of hair it's they

7169.119 --> 7173.28
Brown it's completely

7174.159 --> 7180.759999999999
different not the same race like that's

7177.84 --> 7184.1990000000005
definitely a different route A different

7180.76 --> 7187.280000000001
race and there's many like in Africa

7184.199 --> 7189.48
there is like different tribes of

7187.28 --> 7191.8
Africans that just look completely

7189.48 --> 7195.159
different have different type of skull

7191.8 --> 7197.76
shapes different heights different

7195.159 --> 7197.759999999999
physical

7198.44 --> 7205.32
talents yeah there's Africans that are

7201.239 --> 7211.159
like really broad they're

7205.32 --> 7214.84
like broad built white hips very

7211.159 --> 7220.239
broad big and then there's like the

7214.84 --> 7221.4400000000005
really Slim tall guys like in Ethiopia

7220.239 --> 7224.759999999999
and all

7221.44 --> 7226.879999999999
that and short guys too like dude

7224.76 --> 7230.159000000001
they're and they look different they all

7226.88 --> 7232.4800000000005
like the entire this group like you put

7230.159 --> 7235.239
a photo of that next to the other and

7232.48 --> 7237.199
they like no that's totally different

7235.239 --> 7239.839999999999
it's like just because they're both

7237.199 --> 7242.04
Brown it's like not even the same type

7239.84 --> 7245.84
of brown yeah even the the skin

7242.04 --> 7250.56
complexion color of brown is different

7245.84 --> 7253.4800000000005
it's not the same race it's not the same

7250.56 --> 7257.1990000000005
tribe it's a different route they just

7253.48 --> 7258.28
happen to be roughly in the same part of

7257.199 --> 7261.199
the color

7258.28 --> 7263.88
palette roughly but like with a

7261.199 --> 7266.638999999999
different original tone like it's

7263.88 --> 7266.639
different

7267.96 --> 7276.199
different why did the African just now

7271.679 --> 7281.04
have a Jamaican accent because I like

7276.199 --> 7281.04
jamaic and it's just random

7282.36 --> 7287.32
sometimes African my Africans are

7284.32 --> 7291.28
Jamaicans sometimes they're more likea

7287.32 --> 7293.759999999999
whatever I it just it's random dude it's

7291.28 --> 7293.759999999999
it's all

7302.119 --> 7308.36
random sometimes I just like to like on

7305.199 --> 7310.36
the whim sling in an accent somehow but

7308.36 --> 7312.88
it's going to be relatively superficial

7310.36 --> 7316.4
because if feel like want to properly

7312.88 --> 7318.52
sound like how real Africans like proud

7316.4 --> 7321.119
Africans that are well

7318.52 --> 7322.599
studied it's it's more difficult to

7321.119 --> 7326.159
mimic that properly because they have

7322.599 --> 7330.2390000000005
very specific type of ways of saying it

7326.159 --> 7330.239
and very specific

7331.679 --> 7337.84
inflections

7334.32 --> 7342.199
and I'd have to focus to do it justice

7337.84 --> 7345.1990000000005
so to just roll quickly to a Jamaican

7342.199 --> 7347.638999999999
type accent it's very easy and I don't

7345.199 --> 7350.879999999999
really have to think about

7347.639 --> 7354.159000000001
it but it'll be close enough to bring

7350.88 --> 7354.159000000001
the point across

7358.36 --> 7366.48
right or make you all really laugh so

7361.44 --> 7366.48
hard it's so funny okay fine

7367.96 --> 7370.96
whatever

7371.159 --> 7375.638999999999
I like throw ideas to discuss yeah

7376.28 --> 7379.599
what's so

7380.48 --> 7384.48
what why is everybody so

7391.719 --> 7397.88
weird I was duperon making his search

7394.8 --> 7400.88
history public I don't get

7397.88 --> 7400.88
it

7401.88 --> 7409.2390000000005
he's just exploring duper is just

7406.48 --> 7412.5599999999995
exploring and hey I've done that like

7409.239 --> 7414.799999999999
that and I'm just sharing like hey bro

7412.56 --> 7416.92
yeah I did that again too 20 years ago

7414.8 --> 7419.04
turns out that over time like there's

7416.92 --> 7420.8
another layer of depth and then there's

7419.04 --> 7423.599
another layer of

7420.8 --> 7425.96
depth and so I'm showing that to him

7423.599 --> 7427.88
that's why I addressed this idea it's

7425.96 --> 7430.0
all five races and

7427.88 --> 7433.88
like

7430.0 --> 7433.88
no it's a bit more than just

7433.96 --> 7437.639
that like

7441.32 --> 7446.28
provably I think

7443.44 --> 7449.079
that

7446.28 --> 7450.599
overall I have I'm literally grabbing

7449.079 --> 7453.079
this out of the air it's like almost too

7450.599 --> 7454.360000000001
convenient to say it but I think there

7453.079 --> 7460.799999999999
might be

7454.36 --> 7460.799999999999
like 33 races or 33

7462.079 --> 7467.119
tribes and then well a tribe can split

7465.199 --> 7469.079
up in different tribes that even end up

7467.119 --> 7471.159
opposing themselves but they will still

7469.079 --> 7473.84
look very much alike and might even

7471.159 --> 7475.799999999999
intermar and that's how you know the by

7473.84 --> 7478.159000000001
their Roots so I think there might be

7475.8 --> 7482.4400000000005
like 33

7478.159 --> 7485.199
tribes 33 original races and there like

7482.44 --> 7488.44
every continent has multiple

7485.199 --> 7492.079
races and sometimes One race is spread

7488.44 --> 7496.799999999999
out over multiple places like the Kelts

7492.079 --> 7501.96
are definitely like a race and they are

7496.8 --> 7505.84
everywhere they're in England they're in

7501.96 --> 7508.4
Spain they're in France they're in other

7505.84 --> 7510.639
who knows where other places in the

7508.4 --> 7514.199
world not just

7510.639 --> 7514.1990000000005
Europe and it's like

7514.719 --> 7522.44
historical so that's like a root a race

7519.88 --> 7526.4800000000005
they might be spread out but they are

7522.44 --> 7526.48
like they share the same

7532.76 --> 7540.04
Roots what's worse about 33 it's

7535.96 --> 7545.4800000000005
just I mean why wouldn't it be

7540.04 --> 7550.159
33 we got 33 vertebraes we got 33

7545.48 --> 7554.0
races why not how many Elven races are

7550.159 --> 7556.119
there that it depends on the lore steamy

7554.0 --> 7558.84
traveler I mean are you going to go with

7556.119 --> 7562.159
Lord of the Rings realm

7558.84 --> 7566.360000000001
setting in that case there is

7562.159 --> 7568.799999999999
like four Elven races I

7566.36 --> 7571.799999999999
think right there's the high elf the

7568.8 --> 7575.119000000001
gray elf the wood

7571.8 --> 7575.119000000001
elves and

7575.239 --> 7579.678999999999
the

7577.599 --> 7580.8
this

7579.679 --> 7583.559
another

7580.8 --> 7587.719
one Sun

7583.559 --> 7590.04
elves The Valor elves that aren't in the

7587.719 --> 7591.719
realm yeah so I guess it's three races

7590.04 --> 7594.079
three Elvin rises in The Lord of the

7591.719 --> 7599.199
Ring makes sense they did get three

7594.079 --> 7599.199
rings right yeah the three Elven

7601.88 --> 7606.92
Rings

7604.44 --> 7609.48
yeah I never even thought of that like

7606.92 --> 7612.4400000000005
yeah three rings for the elves so

7609.48 --> 7612.44
there's three Elven

7615.199 --> 7620.799999999999
races right but if you look in the L in

7617.88 --> 7624.04
like Dungeons and Dragons bro I made my

7620.8 --> 7627.1990000000005
own Elven R I made snow

7624.04 --> 7629.199
elves yeah you have the Dr which is a

7627.199 --> 7631.839999999999
Dungeons and Dragons invention didn't

7629.199 --> 7635.36
exist in Lord of the Rings which is

7631.84 --> 7639.32
black skinned whired

7635.36 --> 7642.079
elves underground elves that like to

7639.32 --> 7646.159
hang around spiders they have a Spider

7642.079 --> 7648.32
Queen God even it's crazy that that's a

7646.159 --> 7650.558999999999
dungeon dragon invention not part of the

7648.32 --> 7654.679
Lord of the Rings but definitely part of

7650.559 --> 7656.679
the general idea of elves now and I

7654.679 --> 7659.88
expanded upon that so like yeah what if

7656.679 --> 7659.88
those Dr elves

7660.0 --> 7665.84
actually moved back to the

7662.639 --> 7669.2390000000005
surface became used again to the

7665.84 --> 7672.2390000000005
sunlight and then they became became

7669.239 --> 7676.44
lighter color they became blue so you

7672.239 --> 7679.079
got like blue with white hair snow

7676.44 --> 7683.28
elves not dark blue but pretty light

7679.079 --> 7683.28
blue so they look like

7685.719 --> 7692.76
ice i just invented that it's part of

7690.119 --> 7694.36
the campaign of what I do I've actually

7692.76 --> 7696.400000000001
invented very early as multiple

7694.36 --> 7701.92
campaigns in which there are snow

7696.4 --> 7705.558999999999
elves like snow elves are like the Elven

7701.92 --> 7708.96
Eskimos and they're cold

7705.559 --> 7713.639
resistant and they're basically like

7708.96 --> 7713.639
light blue skinned white haired

7714.52 --> 7720.4400000000005
elves and they are also in competition

7717.76 --> 7723.1990000000005
with these Frost

7720.44 --> 7725.598999999999
Giants which typically also hang around

7723.199 --> 7725.598999999999
icy

7727.4 --> 7730.4
regions

7737.199 --> 7741.0
right anyway I'm going to take a

7739.04 --> 7744.079
two-minute break I'll be right back hope

7741.0 --> 7744.079
you guys are enjoying all

7757.32 --> 7760.32
this

7847.239 --> 7850.239
for

7856.199 --> 7861.079
and I'm

7857.52 --> 7864.400000000001
back I'm frozen on

7861.079 --> 7864.4
screen no I'm

7864.88 --> 7870.719
not go get a Runo I just went to the

7874.04 --> 7880.159
toilet we got 33 viewers do we

7886.84 --> 7893.28
okay nice pipe what pipe what are you

7890.92 --> 7893.28

7909.639 --> 7912.679
it's beer oh

7912.88 --> 7918.0
okay yeah I'm not getting a beer

7915.559 --> 7918.0
definitely

7920.4 --> 7926.32
not I'm done with that stuff man last

7923.719 --> 7931.0
beer I had was during New Year's

7926.32 --> 7931.0
Eve and that just even didn't do it for

7931.719 --> 7937.559
me not it's not entirely it was funny

7934.8 --> 7939.679
for like a half an hour and then it just

7937.559 --> 7943.0
was like yeah and the rest of it is like

7939.679 --> 7944.559
oh it's a a downer well not even a down

7943.0 --> 7945.88
it's just like I feel a little bit gross

7944.559 --> 7948.679
for like 10

7945.88 --> 7951.679
hours after that

7948.679 --> 7951.679
so

7952.4 --> 7956.32
no no more beer for

7959.239 --> 7964.959999999999
me I mean maybe if I'd like hang around

7962.96 --> 7968.28
with other people physically then I'd

7964.96 --> 7970.639
probably I I might at some point drink

7968.28 --> 7973.679
beer again just so I'd be able to deal

7970.639 --> 7976.679
with it better without just getting

7973.679 --> 7976.679
saturated very

7978.8 --> 7983.8
quickly drinking is only fun with

7981.079 --> 7983.799999999999

8396.88 --> 8402.399
whatever I'm going to keep talking going

8398.24 --> 8404.479
to keep bringing it up until they stop

8402.399 --> 8408.96
doing that

8404.479 --> 8408.96
crap stop scapegoating

8416.359 --> 8419.359
tobacco

8421.6 --> 8424.399000000001
are wi for

8431.2 --> 8436.2
president yeah make America Smokey

8446.319 --> 8449.319
again

8455.319 --> 8462.76
right I mean oh we need some thing we

8460.68 --> 8465.399
need some to do with the doctors and

8462.76 --> 8469.12
like oh yeah we just make vaccination

8465.399 --> 8469.119999999999
legal yeah supposed with

8469.8 --> 8475.16
experimentation and just like oh just

8472.319 --> 8479.24
promote smoking again for our doctors I

8475.16 --> 8479.24
mean screw it why not man

8483.52 --> 8488.6
at this point it's like yeah that is

8486.399 --> 8491.599999999999
exactly the opposite of what they've

8488.6 --> 8494.359
tried to achieve so I'm actually for

8491.6 --> 8497.319
it yeah just go back to

8494.359 --> 8499.479000000001
like

8497.319 --> 8502.119999999999
1920s

8499.479 --> 8505.76
policy okay this is getting a bit

8502.12 --> 8508.240000000002
incohesive my point is is that just stop

8505.76 --> 8512.04
the whole tobacco cracked out I'm so

8508.24 --> 8514.92
sick of it yeah this [ __ ] tobacco

8512.04 --> 8517.080000000002
Crackdown is going to cause more cancer

8514.92 --> 8520.08
than the tobacco ever

8517.08 --> 8520.08
will

8521.84 --> 8529.08
yeah yeah you know what provably causes

8525.399 --> 8531.88
very very very aggressive type of

8529.08 --> 8534.64
cancers and all kinds

8531.88 --> 8537.0
of

8534.64 --> 8540.399
self-destruction pharmaceuticals that

8537.0 --> 8542.84
people people take to try to cope with

8540.399 --> 8547.519999999999
life and how [ __ ] up everything

8542.84 --> 8551.319
is because tobacco is old they can't do

8547.52 --> 8554.479000000001
that so then they stress out and start

8551.319 --> 8557.479
taking really bad [ __ ] that is provably

8554.479 --> 8560.96
going to cause like nerve damage

8557.479 --> 8565.24
and crazy behavior and then eventually

8560.96 --> 8567.0
like the something some organ just fails

8565.24 --> 8569.96
and then they get cancer or something

8567.0 --> 8573.2
right yeah yeah that's what actual

8569.96 --> 8575.679999999998
chemical drug [ __ ]

8573.2 --> 8577.720000000001
does that people are going to resort to

8575.68 --> 8580.28
because smoking you can't do that

8577.72 --> 8582.119999999999
anymore you can't take your moment you

8580.28 --> 8585.84
can't demand your own little moment

8582.12 --> 8588.479000000001
where you can just do that and just have

8585.84 --> 8591.319
a little Smoker's

8588.479 --> 8592.88
conversation to to resonate with

8591.319 --> 8595.24
something that's like closer to your

8592.88 --> 8598.16
heart again like that's what that's all

8595.24 --> 8600.24
for yeah that's therapy it's its own

8598.16 --> 8603.24
smoking subculture therapy it's all

8600.24 --> 8605.439
Stripped Away oh no you can't do that

8603.24 --> 8607.6
bad for your health just go to the

8605.439 --> 8610.16
doctor takes an anti-depression

8607.6 --> 8611.399000000001
medication that'll do that'll be good

8610.16 --> 8615.039999999999
for

8611.399 --> 8615.039999999999
you screw

8616.359 --> 8621.399000000001
you make

8619.08 --> 8625.8
smoking normal

8621.399 --> 8628.08
again get rid of pharmaceutical

8625.8 --> 8631.319
garbage yeah

8628.08 --> 8635.68
that causes more death and psychological

8631.319 --> 8635.68
derangement than smoking ever

8636.279 --> 8644.439
has yeah no

8639.319 --> 8646.84
smoker has ever like oh man he's so

8644.439 --> 8649.2
addicted to the smoking he he like

8646.84 --> 8652.64
killed his own family and himself one

8649.2 --> 8654.479000000001
day no no that happens to people that

8652.64 --> 8657.08
mess around with anti-depressant

8654.479 --> 8659.0
medication and then like suddenly stop

8657.08 --> 8661.52
taking it or forget it or something yeah

8659.0 --> 8663.96
they go crazy that's those people do

8661.52 --> 8666.960000000001
that yeah the smokers don't do

8663.96 --> 8666.96
that

8681.399 --> 8690.399
yeah anti-depressant record

8684.84 --> 8690.399

8697.399 --> 8701.599999999999
and no it

8699.399 --> 8704.56
doesn't I'm sorry

8701.6 --> 8706.92
but say

8704.56 --> 8711.56
what Smokey

8706.92 --> 8712.68
Brown really does it now not really

8711.56 --> 8716.68
seeing

8712.68 --> 8719.720000000001
it yeah they might not be eye blindingly

8716.68 --> 8721.319
White or whatever yeah it's not Smoky

8719.72 --> 8724.399
Brown

8721.319 --> 8727.68
though nice yellow

8724.399 --> 8727.68
eyes no it

8728.359 --> 8734.800000000001
isn't the [ __ ] what do you mean yellow

8731.04 --> 8734.800000000001
eyes I do not have yellow

8744.279 --> 8750.16
eyes I do not have a liver condition

8747.52 --> 8750.16
thank you very

8759.52 --> 8765.12
much rough leather skin well it could it

8763.279 --> 8767.04
all depends on how much you're going to

8765.12 --> 8768.720000000001
smoke yeah if you're literally chain

8767.04 --> 8771.160000000002
smoking all day long yeah that's going

8768.72 --> 8773.399
to [ __ ] you up

8771.16 --> 8775.8
eventually because you're continually

8773.399 --> 8778.8
being poisoned

8775.8 --> 8778.8
then

8782.08 --> 8787.72
but if you like smoke a couple of

8785.279 --> 8790.279
cigarettes a day or

8787.72 --> 8794.599999999999
something or better you roll them

8790.279 --> 8799.04
yourself and you use like a good

8794.6 --> 8801.76
filter for it right like a a carbon

8799.04 --> 8804.240000000002
filter something that'll take like some

8801.76 --> 8807.72
of the tar out of

8804.24 --> 8812.319
it yeah you don't get the dirty

8807.72 --> 8812.319
teeth and you don't get the leathery

8812.359 --> 8818.76
skin and you get some focus in your life

8816.479 --> 8821.519999999999
you get a little moment for

8818.76 --> 8824.04
yourself perhaps with communication with

8821.52 --> 8828.319000000001
another smoker that only smokers

8824.04 --> 8828.319000000001
get and then you can have a great

8829.439 --> 8835.52
life yeah smoking doesn't mean that you

8832.92 --> 8837.12
freaking chain smoke all day long right

8835.52 --> 8838.800000000001
that's not what's going going to

8837.12 --> 8841.319000000001
automatically happen

8838.8 --> 8844.399
then certain people have that and

8841.319 --> 8846.199999999999
they're like really addicted to it and

8844.399 --> 8848.119999999999
then they do that and that's a problem

8846.2 --> 8851.240000000002
but it's the addiction

8848.12 --> 8853.439
that's really the problem that they

8851.24 --> 8856.68
can't stop

8853.439 --> 8858.84
it all the time like I don't have that I

8856.68 --> 8860.439
don't have to continue like oh my God I

8858.84 --> 8862.319
have to round out the show because I

8860.439 --> 8865.68
have to like

8862.319 --> 8868.16
quickly no

8865.68 --> 8871.319
no

8868.16 --> 8873.64
I'll like get lunch watch some video do

8871.319 --> 8875.64
some stuff and then maybe at some point

8873.64 --> 8879.72
I might smoke

8875.64 --> 8883.84
something yeah I am not like desperately

8879.72 --> 8883.84
in need of my my shot my

8892.359 --> 8897.439
fix keeping it in moderation not falling

8895.0 --> 8900.399
into addictive yeah well you got to plan

8897.439 --> 8901.960000000001
it out right first off make sure it's

8900.399 --> 8906.519999999999
not too

8901.96 --> 8911.199999999999
easy yeah having a pack like ploop

8906.52 --> 8913.399000000001
cigarette click smoke too easy it's that

8911.2 --> 8915.240000000002
simple it's too easy don't allow

8913.399 --> 8917.599999999999
yourself to do

8915.24 --> 8919.68
that make sure that if you're going to

8917.6 --> 8924.800000000001
smoke something that you have to roll it

8919.68 --> 8928.720000000001
that you take a better time to do it so

8924.8 --> 8932.438999999998
that you can that you literally will be

8928.72 --> 8935.88
incapable of lighting one cigarette with

8932.439 --> 8939.52
the other cuz you need to spend some

8935.88 --> 8942.8
time to make it that's one way to

8939.52 --> 8942.800000000001
prevent that from ever

8949.6 --> 8954.0

9486.2 --> 9491.319000000001
much yeah well that's because they can't

9488.399 --> 9491.319
handle actual

9491.76 --> 9496.800000000001
arguments yeah they they they want to

9494.64 --> 9498.76
roll out their training not thinking for

9496.8 --> 9503.24
other their glow Believers to latch on

9498.76 --> 9506.64
to CU their ways of imagining it is the

9503.24 --> 9509.8
best but they don't like actual rebuttal

9506.64 --> 9512.599999999999
that disprove those

9509.8 --> 9516.119999999999
ideas so they have to make sure that

9512.6 --> 9518.359
it's blurred up whenever those ideas of

9516.12 --> 9521.359
theirs get refuted by completely

9518.359 --> 9524.720000000001
different view on things that actually

9521.359 --> 9529.800000000001
draws in logical consequences and

9524.72 --> 9529.8
such so they talk over it it's called

9530.16 --> 9534.68
rassing yeah rassing is the real

9554.64 --> 9557.64
censorship

9558.08 --> 9564.56
right always have to block people that

9561.16 --> 9565.76
contradict them indeed but not just that

9564.56 --> 9570.039999999999
they

9565.76 --> 9570.04
also have to create the

9571.52 --> 9580.800000000001
ridiculous ideas about like bendy

9576.319 --> 9584.64
light all these physics defying

9580.8 --> 9586.64
mathematically originated Concepts to

9584.64 --> 9589.92
justify

9586.64 --> 9591.92
why the Earth doesn't look like a globe

9589.92 --> 9594.439
in any

9591.92 --> 9598.0
way like when you actually look with

9594.439 --> 9600.76
your own eyes in this

9598.0 --> 9602.96
place they have to like invent

9600.76 --> 9606.04
conception so it's not just sensorship

9602.96 --> 9608.519999999999
and rassing of common sense it's also oh

9606.04 --> 9611.279
look at these Fantastical

9608.52 --> 9612.84
machinations that's supposedly justify

9611.279 --> 9616.04
why the Earth doesn't look like a globe

9612.84 --> 9618.279
or doesn't behave like a globe and why

9616.04 --> 9619.960000000001
you wouldn't expect to see any coris

9618.279 --> 9622.52
deviation

9619.96 --> 9626.438999999998
Etc all

9622.52 --> 9626.439
that right that's the second

9628.84 --> 9634.72
component oh you have a p900 that's cute

9632.24 --> 9634.72
good for

9644.52 --> 9649.640000000001
you

9646.96 --> 9652.64
I wonder is pay the

9649.64 --> 9652.64
shills

9660.72 --> 9668.92
what I think that people just that just

9665.16 --> 9672.16
like those types of stories like to hear

9668.92 --> 9676.16
people talk about globes in outer space

9672.16 --> 9678.119999999999
I think that they pay those people

9676.16 --> 9680.479
because they want to hear their stories

9678.12 --> 9683.04
not because they know it's actually flat

9680.479 --> 9685.72
and they don't want anybody to find out

9683.04 --> 9689.6
I think they just pay them because they

9685.72 --> 9689.599999999999
just like to hear those nonsense

9693.08 --> 9700.399
stories they want to be diluted

9697.16 --> 9705.52
diluted so they pay for people that

9700.399 --> 9708.039999999999
delude them that reinforce their dis

9705.52 --> 9712.52
proven beliefs so that they can't

9708.04 --> 9712.52
forget about how it's actually not

9715.0 --> 9720.88
real people pay for other people to

9718.16 --> 9724.16
create Illusions for them yeah that's

9720.88 --> 9727.199999999999
also what movie making is especially

9724.16 --> 9733.039999999999
Hollywood movie making yeah they create

9727.2 --> 9733.04
an illusion for you to believe

9734.359 --> 9739.399000000001
in and you pay them money for

9760.0 --> 9767.88
it we need to point it at stars with

9763.84 --> 9770.56
autofocus on no you don't need to it's

9767.88 --> 9776.358999999999
just yeah it might seem like stars are

9770.56 --> 9776.359
like watery dency thingies but it

9778.76 --> 9786.800000000001
isn't it just appears to look like that

9783.52 --> 9788.92
hey celestials are very mysterious okay

9786.8 --> 9791.438999999998
and you do weird Focus stuff on them

9788.92 --> 9796.72
yeah all kinds of weird things

9791.439 --> 9800.439
happen it doesn't prove what it is

9796.72 --> 9805.0
it's not a light shining out of the

9800.439 --> 9807.479000000001
water on the other side of the Dome okay

9805.0 --> 9811.12
that's very cute it's a very cute

9807.479 --> 9811.119999999999
fantasy that is not

9824.279 --> 9827.279
real

9829.08 --> 9832.08
H

9832.479 --> 9835.479
what

9854.0 --> 9859.12
what cool you're an actual person

9859.52 --> 9862.52
blaty

9866.16 --> 9870.6
welcome you actually of course they

9868.56 --> 9873.439
believe it they have

9870.6 --> 9875.08
to otherwise nothing works right they

9873.439 --> 9876.92
have to believe in gravity even if they

9875.08 --> 9879.76
don't understand what it is or if they

9876.92 --> 9881.960000000001
are going to fall back to certain claims

9879.76 --> 9884.72
and in visualizations of what gravity is

9881.96 --> 9886.438999999998
supposed to be that have been officially

9884.72 --> 9889.399
debunked

9886.439 --> 9891.319
Through official sources but I mean you

9889.399 --> 9894.68
got to believe in something right

9891.319 --> 9898.68
gravity is got to be something is really

9894.68 --> 9900.68
the exit strategy there right that's

9898.68 --> 9904.64
what what's really going on with the

9900.68 --> 9909.12
globers gravity it's got to be

9904.64 --> 9911.24
something right that's really their

9909.12 --> 9914.08
predicament it should be the title

9911.24 --> 9918.6
actually of the

9914.08 --> 9918.6
show gravity it's got to be

9942.6 --> 9948.16
something okay sure

9946.279 --> 9950.0
right but anyway I am going to round out

9948.16 --> 9952.88
the show now because it's getting kind

9950.0 --> 9952.88
of dark and all

9956.2 --> 9959.92
that thanks for finally getting active

9958.92 --> 9962.12
again

9959.92 --> 9964.479
though I guess sometimes they just have

9962.12 --> 9968.560000000001
to yell at you and threaten to close out

9964.479 --> 9968.56
the show before people finally say

9974.0 --> 9981.76
something

9976.08 --> 9985.279
he drops the slinky down what Ace

9981.76 --> 9988.279
F he drops a slinky down the

9985.279 --> 9988.279
pyramid

9994.6 --> 10000.12
what I don't remember

9997.319 --> 10003.519999999999
that he did probably did something that

10000.12 --> 10007.0
crazy huh that's so curious I don't

10003.52 --> 10007.0
remember that Richie G

10015.6 --> 10020.479000000001
second what pet detect it's probably the

10018.68 --> 10023.16
Pet Detective one

10020.479 --> 10025.76
right so it's probably the first one the

10023.16 --> 10028.76
second one is

10025.76 --> 10028.76
going

10032.16 --> 10038.84
International Nature Calls

10036.08 --> 10040.479
when Nature yeah anyway second one is

10038.84 --> 10043.6
the

10040.479 --> 10045.438999999998
silliest but I don't remember that about

10043.6 --> 10048.12
a slinky that's

10045.439 --> 10049.960000000001
weird I want to almost like scroll

10048.12 --> 10054.68
through the movie now to see what scene

10049.96 --> 10060.0
that is just don't remember

10054.68 --> 10060.0
anyhow get a slinky no no

10060.76 --> 10066.04
thanks

10062.279 --> 10069.04
like I might have a eat a product that

10066.04 --> 10072.279
would be like a slinky but purely

10069.04 --> 10075.2
organic and not specifically made for

10072.279 --> 10076.92
longterm storage which is what slinkies

10075.2 --> 10079.04
were designed for which makes them

10076.92 --> 10082.84
chemically

10079.04 --> 10085.279
disgusting and not very

10082.84 --> 10087.92
nutritious but I'd eat a slinky if it

10085.279 --> 10092.76
was purely organic and

10087.92 --> 10092.76
fresh sure I try that sounds

10093.8 --> 10098.56
delightful it's from it's from Nature

10096.479 --> 10102.88
Calls

10098.56 --> 10104.56
right oh now I remember the slinky on

10102.88 --> 10108.479
the

10104.56 --> 10112.479
staircase I was thinking of another

10108.479 --> 10115.479
Slinky I I mixed up the word Slinky I

10112.479 --> 10117.96
was TW thinking of a Twinkie it isn't a

10115.479 --> 10120.24
Twinkie the slinky is like the spring

10117.96 --> 10122.96
thing that goes down the stairs yes I

10120.24 --> 10126.16
remember that scene yeah that's amazing

10122.96 --> 10129.64
right and it stops right before the last

10126.16 --> 10133.24
staircase yeah now I

10129.64 --> 10135.439
remember yeah yeah I thought like what

10133.24 --> 10139.0
the hell are you talking about

10135.439 --> 10141.279
dropping like a slinky

10139.0 --> 10144.84
twinky onto a

10141.279 --> 10147.12
pyramid was like what but it's down the

10144.84 --> 10149.68
staircase and it was like the spring

10147.12 --> 10151.439
thing now I now I'm starting to remember

10149.68 --> 10153.880000000001
what the hell you're talking about I

10151.439 --> 10156.720000000001
thought I got completely off the wrong

10153.88 --> 10156.72
track there

10159.12 --> 10162.560000000001
a slinky is not a

10162.64 --> 10166.239
twinky it's weird that they call those

10165.319 --> 10168.359
things

10166.239 --> 10170.16
slinkies that's not what they call them

10168.359 --> 10172.08
over here in the

10170.16 --> 10173.16
Netherlands I don't even remember what

10172.08 --> 10175.56
the hell they call them here in the

10173.16 --> 10176.72
Netherlands but I mean yeah that was

10175.56 --> 10180.039999999999
just a

10176.72 --> 10182.278999999999
complete misinterpretation of track

10180.04 --> 10185.720000000001
response there from my side sorry about

10182.279 --> 10189.479000000001
that yeah definitely was remember the

10185.72 --> 10189.479
slinky down the stairs

10192.04 --> 10199.6
scene which was like probably the best

10195.84 --> 10203.399
ad for Slinky sales

10199.6 --> 10207.279
ever like that has been ever made was

10203.399 --> 10207.278999999999
Ace fentura doing that in that

10208.08 --> 10215.279
movie I mean that probably sold more

10212.12 --> 10217.560000000001
slinkies than any Slinky advert man has

10215.279 --> 10217.560000000001
ever

10217.68 --> 10221.56
done you know I'm

10226.68 --> 10234.399
right you said pyramid yeah yeah yeah

10230.479 --> 10238.039999999999
it's down the well sort of not really

10234.399 --> 10240.88
though but yeah we both kind of got off

10238.04 --> 10243.640000000001
on the wrong but we we got back to what

10240.88 --> 10245.56
we were actually

10243.64 --> 10248.0
meaning

10245.56 --> 10251.199999999999
all right anyway I on that note I am
