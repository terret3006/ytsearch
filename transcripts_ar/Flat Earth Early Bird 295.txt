70.619 --> 88.649
so today well just take a look it's just

80.539 --> 91.92
rain rain rain yeah not very hard rain

88.649 --> 98.28
but still it's wet and it's kind of cold

91.92 --> 99.06
and well it's been a great summer so I

98.28 --> 104.18
can't complain

99.06 --> 110.75
I got Tamara coffee with me today and

104.18 --> 115.2
tea that's it I'm trying to take it easy

110.75 --> 118.77
my funds yeah may be a bit tricky at

115.2 --> 121.43
this moment so I have to figure out some

118.77 --> 125.03
stuff before we can get it rolling again

121.43 --> 125.03
my dad and me

128.55 --> 141.55
let's see who isn't Chad Steve was first

138.16 --> 147.989
a gem let's talk

141.55 --> 151.54000000000002
let me read through that the miss Kang

147.989 --> 155.31900000000002
that that one guy who had apparently has

151.54 --> 157.379
some interesting vivid dreams flat-out

155.319 --> 165.64
faith

157.379 --> 169.29
oh-ho magic Fyodor Dostoevsky stopping

165.64 --> 169.29
traffic in my rest I had a little dude

169.56 --> 176.549
unicorn laser eyes Nicole Garland

172.87 --> 176.549
yeah good to see you all

179.67 --> 189.02999999999997
terminator really Rasta ish shot Tibet's

193.67 --> 201.2
all right yeah surprisingly I've been

198.069 --> 205.76
going on the bicycle twice today two

201.2 --> 212.78
rounds it managed to evade most of the

205.76 --> 220.14999999999998
rain but now it's just pouring all right

212.78 --> 220.15
well magic 5/0 is 5 times infinity I

222.25 --> 232.22
know that doesn't make any sense but

224.63 --> 237.19
that's technically what it is hey thanks

232.22 --> 237.19
Sean Tibet for the super jet 2 pounds

242.4 --> 249.56
Oh Karen be at the show last night I

245.209 --> 249.56
would know I went to bed quite early

250.16 --> 256.32
actually skipped dinner it's weird it's

254.55 --> 260.85
a weird trend every time I don't drink

256.32 --> 262.109
alcohol and inner now and well I don't

260.85 --> 267.81
know if I'm gonna be skipping dinner

262.109 --> 270.51
this evening but I'm having a second day

267.81 --> 272.91
I don't know with this kind of weather

270.51 --> 273.83
you know the beer isn't that appealing

272.91 --> 277.95000000000005
anyway

273.83 --> 289.21999999999997
it tastes less nice it's weird it's like

277.95 --> 289.21999999999997
it tastes more bitter yeah a free - Effy

289.82 --> 295.19
own strange world right what's a strange

293.16 --> 297.90000000000003
world I haven't seen it sorry

295.19 --> 301.65
I'll see if I can take a look somewhere

297.9 --> 304.63899999999995
in the day all right I see the

301.65 --> 304.63899999999995
notification

307.97 --> 311.38000000000005
I missed out on a lot

318.909 --> 327.669
on Tuesday right right yeah I kind of

321.999 --> 329.83000000000004
have to I'm kind of a creature of habit

327.669 --> 332.25899999999996
so it takes some time for me to get used

329.83 --> 340.33
to some new show being around at some

332.259 --> 343.16900000000004
point yes okay but I'll try to remember

340.33 --> 343.169
it's on Tuesday

350.93 --> 358.91
yeah anyway they're watching some more

354.59 --> 363.46999999999997
Dark Crystal that was interesting I do

358.91 --> 369.47
have to hand it to the story writers

363.47 --> 373.97
that they yeah it's not perfect but they

369.47 --> 374.62
still made a realistic feeling story out

373.97 --> 380.63000000000005
of it

374.62 --> 382.28000000000003
that is it takes some time to figure out

380.63 --> 387.05
but it's supposed to be a prequel to a

382.28 --> 390.669
movie and I guess you could yeah there's

387.05 --> 393.08
some changes to the overarching

390.669 --> 395.479
functions of the story like they change

393.08 --> 398.3
some things because hey Dark Crystal was

395.479 --> 400.07
really mystical mostly they just told

398.3 --> 402.229
some things showed some mysterious

400.07 --> 404.9
things and you had to figure it out for

402.229 --> 407.389
herself was very mysterious movie here

404.9 --> 410.229
they unfortunately lay a bit more

407.389 --> 413.63
groundwork as to how it all functions

410.229 --> 415.96999999999997
it's yeah it's a bit like the medic

413.63 --> 420.46999999999997
glory and I guess to some of the

415.97 --> 421.97
original Dark Crystal fans but it's it

420.47 --> 423.32000000000005
takes some getting used to it's not that

421.97 --> 429.97900000000004
bad really

423.32 --> 432.919
and I don't know they got some really

429.979 --> 436.34
interesting systems in there it's real

432.919 --> 440.78
like the Skeksis are obviously grapplers

436.34 --> 444.46999999999997
and they're tricking the entire gelfling

440.78 --> 447.44
realm into serving them basically and

444.47 --> 452.449
worshiping them and it's put down really

447.44 --> 455.12
well really with a religious authority

452.449 --> 457.22
and how that works and how the golf

455.12 --> 460.37
links are conditional that it's really

457.22 --> 462.8
impressive so yeah I don't know I'll

460.37 --> 465.53000000000003
keep watching it and every episode is

462.8 --> 469.159
like half a movie and it is as almost as

465.53 --> 471.44
intense as half a movie so it almost

469.159 --> 475.52
seems like wow this entire series could

471.44 --> 479.029
be just a huge movie cut down to series

475.52 --> 481.82
sized bites because it does kind of seem

479.029 --> 483.29
like that a lot of the time

481.82 --> 491.56
there's a little bit more filler in

483.29 --> 491.56
there but yeah it's interesting anyway

492.01 --> 497.06
although yeah I guess it does take away

495.23 --> 508.67
a little bit of the magic of the

497.06 --> 509.95
original movie so I don't know I guess

508.67 --> 514.58
it would be best to just

509.95 --> 516.41
compartmentalize the two because it's

514.58 --> 519.1690000000001
not that far off it's not like a

516.41 --> 520.9399999999999
complete reimagining of it all now it's

519.169 --> 525.77
not that terrible except for the first

520.94 --> 528.4000000000001
five seconds zoom in on the globe of

525.77 --> 531.05
their world and that is just freaking

528.4 --> 533.5699999999999
repulsive repulsive but the rest they

531.05 --> 542.03
don't do that so thank God they don't

533.57 --> 545.6
keep on doing that so I've been watching

542.03 --> 550.64
that thinking more about D&D and how to

545.6 --> 552.32
put it all down also this morning got an

550.64 --> 555.46
impulse like yeah I gotta change

552.32 --> 558.95
something about the show because it is

555.46 --> 561.71
even though I may be amusing or

558.95 --> 564.1700000000001
entertaining or informative to enough

561.71 --> 567.73
people to keep on following me it is

564.17 --> 570.38
kind of monotonous in the way it looks

567.73 --> 573.83
because hey I thought there's a decent

570.38 --> 576.38
background picture right it's the

573.83 --> 580.6700000000001
rectangular looping Flat Earth model but

576.38 --> 583.79
it's like one picture and I got a lot of

580.67 --> 587.6899999999999
interesting pictures so I thought I'd

583.79 --> 589.16
make a slideshow and yeah the pictures

587.69 --> 592.82
are still all different sizes and

589.16 --> 596.92
everything but I thought I'll just show

592.82 --> 599.84
you kind of what I got together so far

596.92 --> 601.43
so there you go I'll just keep on

599.84 --> 604.95
talking on back

601.43 --> 611.52
it's just like the things that I used

604.95 --> 614.58
over the years and maps and I should put

611.52 --> 616.68
yeah I could actually do that right now

614.58 --> 620.64
because it's anchored on a folder just

616.68 --> 623.1899999999999
inject other things in it that's funny I

620.64 --> 627.56
should put my model drawings in it as

623.19 --> 627.5600000000001
well let's see

627.92 --> 633.2099999999999
alternative flat earth models yeah oh I

631.23 --> 637.73
definitely got to put those in there

633.21 --> 640.73
although they are kind of light-colored

637.73 --> 640.73
that's

641.47 --> 644.509
[Music]

657.51 --> 665.66
right I'll put these in there I wonder

663.54 --> 671.8499999999999
if you're gonna see them right away

665.66 --> 678.39
bang I'll see it soon enough anyway yeah

671.85 --> 683.85
just I I don't know if I might I might

678.39 --> 685.74
jumble around the entire layout make it

683.85 --> 687.51
different so that it would make more

685.74 --> 689.4300000000001
sense with this on the background

687.51 --> 690.99
because if my head is just mostly in

689.43 --> 692.0999999999999
front of it you're not gonna be seeing

690.99 --> 695.04
anything pretty much

692.1 --> 698.7900000000001
or maybe you guys prefer to look at this

695.04 --> 701.81
instead of my head I know I'm not that

698.79 --> 701.81
interesting looking

705.81 --> 708.8299999999999
[Music]

713.42 --> 721.7199999999999
that's not in there yet I see let me see

718.43 --> 721.7199999999999
if I can refresh it

738.23 --> 741.79
let me change it

743.28 --> 748.1999999999999
to see if it works to something

745.86 --> 750.21
different to my giant picture stunt

748.2 --> 759.35
presentation and then switch it back and

750.21 --> 759.35
perhaps it will then recognize it

762.66 --> 764.6899999999999
Oh

765.23 --> 769.839
oops

767.32 --> 771.88
right oh the pictures are in there but I

769.839 --> 774.5400000000001
got to resize it oh that's just freaking

771.88 --> 779.49
great well I have to do that on the spot

774.54 --> 779.49
it's just brilliant we

793.16 --> 799.12
wait

795.14 --> 799.12
no that's not right

805.519 --> 809.29
yeah it should be more like this

826.32 --> 838.72
anyway yeah this is a just some stuff I

831.76 --> 840.97
put together no it looks like that they

838.72 --> 844.35
had the anyway it's warping it all

840.97 --> 852.58
because it's not the same type of

844.35 --> 854.95
picture sizes and everything so right

852.58 --> 861.97
make my camera a small window in the

854.95 --> 866.74
corner I could do that anyway any

861.97 --> 869.22
comments on the pictures would be nice

866.74 --> 869.22
what do you guys think

873.73 --> 884.619
what Fyodor Dostoevsky you can't be

877.359 --> 885.73
serious you don't know if I'm an atheist

884.619 --> 888.269
or theist

885.73 --> 888.269
really

895.61 --> 904.22
it's right Resta yeah sure you would

900.17 --> 910.79
like to add that one okay I'm just gonna

904.22 --> 916.0400000000001
show everyone what Rasta actually wanted

910.79 --> 930.4599999999999
to show all right he wants me to add

916.04 --> 930.4599999999999
this picture in there that is so Rasta

932.86 --> 945.44
anyway yeah I could look but the thing

941.48 --> 948.08
is I yeah there is like hundreds of

945.44 --> 950.3000000000001
thousands of kind of like funny troll

948.08 --> 953.09
related comment pictures

950.3 --> 955.0999999999999
it's just what flat so it put out puts

953.09 --> 957.44
out alone in the master be chat is like

955.1 --> 960.44
it's like thousands of pictures by now

957.44 --> 962.87
okay I could do that but I kind of

960.44 --> 966.11
wanted to keep it personal like the

962.87 --> 969.8
things that I've actually made and that

966.11 --> 972.97
aren't necessarily trolling you know

969.8 --> 972.9699999999999
pictures with some history

977.149 --> 988.37
take a vote well people can give me

985.37 --> 993.47
suggestions they can always drop a

988.37 --> 997.269
picture in the Skype and I'll take a

993.47 --> 1000.629
look at least yeah I know it's a classic

997.269 --> 1000.629
Rasta I know

1018.23 --> 1021.74
agnostic what

1023.04 --> 1035.9099999999999
why would I be agnostic creation and

1028.77 --> 1040.62
design is very apparent why would I

1035.91 --> 1045.1200000000001
believe it would just arise there by

1040.62 --> 1047.4589999999998
itself unguided by some design but

1045.12 --> 1051.2399999999998
guided by chaos that's not going to

1047.459 --> 1062.04
happen it's a contradiction in in design

1051.24 --> 1064.88
yeah in in complex things you know it's

1062.04 --> 1064.8799999999999
not logical

1081.69 --> 1084.56
okay

1084.749 --> 1091.959
theist who is irreligious what okay so

1089.289 --> 1096.489
you mean he believes in the creator and

1091.959 --> 1101.559
creation and what he doesn't worship any

1096.489 --> 1106.659
deity or he's not part of because he

1101.559 --> 1111.82
religious that that's that's kind of the

1106.659 --> 1113.919
atheist type of approach but look it can

1111.82 --> 1117.369
mean something very different if you are

1113.919 --> 1119.2
actually a believer in God I mean you

1117.369 --> 1124.059
don't want to be part of organized

1119.2 --> 1128.1390000000001
religion and I myself and kind of there

1124.059 --> 1134.309
as well but I call it eclectic not

1128.139 --> 1134.309
irreligious it's just I very carefully

1134.519 --> 1146.739
guide my own personal religion very

1139.45 --> 1152.999
carefully advised and attuned to Christ

1146.739 --> 1152.999
and the path and all that that frequency

1153.029 --> 1159.929
but yet it's more yeah it's a personal

1158.2 --> 1162.929
method I I'm not part of some

1159.929 --> 1162.929
organization

1170.1 --> 1176.6999999999998
although although I do yeah I empathize

1173.64 --> 1183.24
with individuals that could have a

1176.7 --> 1185.55
religion absolutely because technically

1183.24 --> 1188.91
I don't think it really matters if you

1185.55 --> 1191.27
are or not it depends on how you do

1188.91 --> 1194.28
things wherever you are whatever

1191.27 --> 1197.67
decisions you make really what are you

1194.28 --> 1199.95
going to do with that and if you are

1197.67 --> 1203.13
part of a religion and that religion

1199.95 --> 1206.82
also has bad sites then she you should

1203.13 --> 1209.7600000000002
be trying to fight that off because the

1206.82 --> 1212.28
bad the darkness can always be found in

1209.76 --> 1215.06
any big organization it's very hard to

1212.28 --> 1215.06
keep it away

1231.91 --> 1236.41
Patt religion good band what

1244.85 --> 1250.399
alright Fyodor Dostoevsky nick gnostic

1247.899 --> 1253.9089999999999
right well at least it's better than

1250.399 --> 1256.1589999999999
being an atheist because it doesn't take

1253.909 --> 1258.44
the bitterness with it that's very

1256.159 --> 1260.6000000000001
healthy I think for a person with your

1258.44 --> 1265.759
intelligence it's much healthier to be

1260.6 --> 1267.5
an agnostic than an atheist because

1265.759 --> 1269.69
otherwise you start to dwell on the

1267.5 --> 1272.139
darkness and that what atheists always

1269.69 --> 1274.13
do they can't help it they

1272.139 --> 1276.4289999999999
subconsciously encourage it with one

1274.13 --> 1279.44
another it's terrible

1276.429 --> 1281.72
try to it's always like the act of

1279.44 --> 1284.779
trying to pretend like it doesn't really

1281.72 --> 1290.8990000000001
matter because God's not real it's

1284.779 --> 1296.389
really that's what they kind of do I was

1290.899 --> 1299.539
part of that even when I was younger but

1296.389 --> 1301.789
in my mind I was always kind of kind of

1299.539 --> 1304.549
double speaking in the face of it all

1301.789 --> 1307.1
that's how I went through that because I

1304.549 --> 1310.9089999999999
kind of did believe in God I felt it you

1307.1 --> 1313.73
know that it's just that in my mind I

1310.909 --> 1318.019
would be protesting like the official

1313.73 --> 1320.3600000000001
religious orders and what they did but

1318.019 --> 1324.1
the people I was talking to I was pretty

1320.36 --> 1327.9189999999999
sure that they did not they actually

1324.1 --> 1331.25
really were total atheists and really

1327.919 --> 1334.6390000000001
double triple down on that and wasn't

1331.25 --> 1337.879
nice when they got off you when they get

1334.639 --> 1340.6999999999998
all furious against Christ and [ __ ] so

1337.879 --> 1341.33
at that time I just kind of kept it to

1340.7 --> 1345.46
myself

1341.33 --> 1348.559
and double spoke my way through

1345.46 --> 1350.99
pretending to be an atheist sort of but

1348.559 --> 1354.44
not actually being that and when I

1350.99 --> 1358.73
eventually did reveal it like those

1354.44 --> 1361.5700000000002
people fled from me in a way they became

1358.73 --> 1361.57
kind of hostile

1364.55 --> 1375.1789999999999
man I can't still remember at the time

1368.059 --> 1377.46
was it 2015 when I broke it to my

1375.179 --> 1380.0700000000002
friends like yeah I am into Flat Earth

1377.46 --> 1382.65
now and I'm I think I've become you

1380.07 --> 1385.559
could say if you think that's crazy then

1382.65 --> 1387.0900000000001
just say that I've become religious you

1385.559 --> 1389.34
know whatever it works for you whatever

1387.09 --> 1394.5
is comprehendible to you but when I said

1389.34 --> 1396.33
that like those people we had sort of

1394.5 --> 1399.66
been my friends for a long time they

1396.33 --> 1406.58
like became furious with me like I was

1399.66 --> 1410.01
betraying them and after that it yeah

1406.58 --> 1413.85
didn't take too long before yeah the

1410.01 --> 1416.96
friendship pretty much ended too much

1413.85 --> 1416.9599999999998
friction after that point

1432.46 --> 1439.8400000000001
well spare-room music that the weird

1436.179 --> 1442.8400000000001
thing is reflecting now on my own way of

1439.84 --> 1446.1689999999999
how as I said kind of double spoke my

1442.84 --> 1448.769
way through being sneaky yeah that's

1446.169 --> 1451.72
what that is but also defensive because

1448.769 --> 1457.509
it was just kind of a tense situation

1451.72 --> 1459.07
really and I just started to notice know

1457.509 --> 1462.029
more and more that I didn't really

1459.07 --> 1466.36
belong there among that type of mindset

1462.029 --> 1470.83
so but as people probably know by now I

1466.36 --> 1472.6899999999998
am kind of a creature of habit and I

1470.83 --> 1476.649
don't like change so it's very hard for

1472.69 --> 1480.009
me to then actually step away or find a

1476.649 --> 1484.57
really good reason to do that because I

1480.009 --> 1486.7
also needed friends a lot and they were

1484.57 --> 1489.039
kind of friends to be well they're not

1486.7 --> 1493.57
just kind they were friends to me they

1489.039 --> 1499.6589999999999
really were but that they also took

1493.57 --> 1502.539
their toll and as time passed less and

1499.659 --> 1504.929
less subjects were left for us to talk

1502.539 --> 1507.429
about because we disagreed about so much

1504.929 --> 1513.97
started out with my opinions about

1507.429 --> 1516.0700000000002
creation eventually gaming what D&D was

1513.97 --> 1524.95
like literally almost the only thing we

1516.07 --> 1527.35
could talk about by words now it has not

1524.95 --> 1529.6000000000001
become Bible early-bird stop a traffic

1527.35 --> 1532.9289999999999
in marest a hat but hey the path of

1529.6 --> 1538.899
Christ and religion in general it is a

1532.929 --> 1543.669
very important topic and if you really

1538.899 --> 1546.6689999999999
don't like it then sorry but sometimes

1543.669 --> 1550.1100000000001
it needs to be talked about and hey

1546.669 --> 1553.3600000000001
there look there are plenty of errors

1550.11 --> 1555.519
for me to point at with Christians or

1553.36 --> 1560.9799999999998
people that think they're Christians

1555.519 --> 1565.47
when they don't act Christian so I do

1560.98 --> 1572.6100000000001
that I'm not again I'm not a hypocrite

1565.47 --> 1575.58
and it I don't like it when people just

1572.61 --> 1577.379
misbehave especially if they if they

1575.58 --> 1581.21
think they're Christian and they don't

1577.379 --> 1586.32
realize that they do that that's all but

1581.21 --> 1590.1000000000001
yeah and when I do yeah dude that kind

1586.32 --> 1596.519
of [ __ ] as well then I try to set things

1590.1 --> 1601.23
right afterwards just everyday well

1596.519 --> 1607.11
sorry it's just if it comes up it comes

1601.23 --> 1609.99
up and hey if there's more flatter the

1607.11 --> 1613.86
issues we can talk about then let's do

1609.99 --> 1620.73
that I'm all fine with it I'm just going

1613.86 --> 1626.7299999999998
with what's brought up now Trish flights

1620.73 --> 1632.789
I don't think that why do you think that

1626.73 --> 1635.429
I think that I am NOT even generally

1632.789 --> 1644.009
referring to how people behave towards

1635.429 --> 1647.3090000000002
me okay I'm not saying Oh world why are

1644.009 --> 1650.25
Christians being so mean to me I don't

1647.309 --> 1652.799
like Christians being mean to me I'm

1650.25 --> 1655.5
going to punish Christians being mean to

1652.799 --> 1657.87
me that's not what I'm saying don't take

1655.5 --> 1660.6
my words as if they were coming from a

1657.87 --> 1663.35
simpleton okay I just find that kind of

1660.6 --> 1663.35
insulting

1667.43 --> 1675.6000000000001
when I point out people's mistakes

1671.13 --> 1676.98
I don't go bulrush them and then tell

1675.6 --> 1681.06
her you got to do this you got to do

1676.98 --> 1683.16
that like that because it sucks I don't

1681.06 --> 1686.52
like it when people do that to me I

1683.16 --> 1691.65
don't do that to other people and for

1686.52 --> 1704.3
example when I find people out I'm not

1691.65 --> 1704.3000000000002
I'm rather doing that for myself okay

1713.25 --> 1722.669
I just don't like pushiness it's what

1718.62 --> 1726.2099999999998
got me against its what kind of enabled

1722.669 --> 1729.8090000000002
me and now I'm not blaming Christians

1726.21 --> 1734.809
for the choices that I was basically

1729.809 --> 1734.809
making back in the day a long time ago

1735.049 --> 1744.3899999999999
but that image that behavior was the

1739.919 --> 1748.44
thing that made me think like yeah they

1744.39 --> 1751.0800000000002
kind of got a point okay so just so you

1748.44 --> 1754.8500000000001
realize that I'm not the only one

1751.08 --> 1757.59
thinking that people now you know very

1754.85 --> 1759.99
young people even they may be thinking

1757.59 --> 1762.36
well you know what kind of is a point to

1759.99 --> 1765.27
a whole god thing in creation is all

1762.36 --> 1767.85
that info but yeah Christians you know

1765.27 --> 1771.3899999999999
and in their mind that's the annoying

1767.85 --> 1773.25
people because they ruin it for the

1771.39 --> 1777.48
really nice good ones where you can

1773.25 --> 1782.19
actually learn a lot and calm down and

1777.48 --> 1786.299
all that so that's just a chronic

1782.19 --> 1788.22
problem with the Christian community and

1786.299 --> 1790.62
I'm not pointing at every single

1788.22 --> 1795.419
individual now it's just a type of

1790.62 --> 1797.82
behavior that is being tolerated from

1795.419 --> 1799.26
the rest because they want to be

1797.82 --> 1802.28
tolerant and I think okay it's

1799.26 --> 1808.86
Christians instead of helping them to

1802.28 --> 1812.1589999999999
stop that because it's I don't know I

1808.86 --> 1817.35
don't think anybody becomes happy from

1812.159 --> 1822.0490000000002
being very accusatory all the time that

1817.35 --> 1822.049
that that does that can't really work

1823.57 --> 1828.86
it's like a pecking order nature

1826.61 --> 1830.4799999999998
adapting to a fecking order nature can't

1828.86 --> 1833.24
really ever make you happy because

1830.48 --> 1836.81
you're always doing the switchboard

1833.24 --> 1843.41
thing always judging and that doesn't

1836.81 --> 1849.58
really make you happy anyway those are

1843.41 --> 1853.25
just some issues come on Trish Blythe

1849.58 --> 1861.08
Rasta is just a very unrepentant

1853.25 --> 1865.85
okay as far as I understand or maybe he

1861.08 --> 1869.32
says he's an agnostic too I don't know I

1865.85 --> 1872.12
don't remember this you'll have to

1869.32 --> 1878.97
enlighten us about that Rasta if you

1872.12 --> 1886.3799999999999
want to okay

1878.97 --> 1886.38
[Music]

1891.77 --> 1894.6399999999999
that's interesting

1900.12 --> 1908.75
although one could argue that you can

1902.99 --> 1908.75
repent through man to God

1915.47 --> 1920.0
but you gotta be careful not to be

1917.48 --> 1925.3990000000001
repenting to grab lers because they love

1920.0 --> 1927.23
that [ __ ] they loved it because they

1925.399 --> 1929.7099999999998
don't have any they don't have any

1927.23 --> 1934.48
repentance so they love to basically

1929.71 --> 1937.73
take take the money or take whatever

1934.48 --> 1939.679
take any repentance they'll gladly take

1937.73 --> 1942.039
it from other people that feel guilty

1939.679 --> 1944.48
about something they love taking that

1942.039 --> 1944.99
because they know our this is all for

1944.48 --> 1958.669
free

1944.99 --> 1961.009
it's so stupid how dare this is okay

1958.669 --> 1963.289
it's so Trish Blythe Rasta just so you

1961.009 --> 1965.929
know I don't know if you're gonna be

1963.289 --> 1968.45
bickering about this and starting some

1965.929 --> 1970.94
feud but I am NOT gonna be peer

1968.45 --> 1974.059
pressured by either of you to ban either

1970.94 --> 1980.96
of you just so you know ahead of time

1974.059 --> 1985.299
just giving you a heads-up as sorry

1980.96 --> 1985.299
Nicole Garland I did not

1995.67 --> 2006.0500000000002
I think topics are theme of a day like

2000.65 --> 2008.39
that now no it doesn't thanks for the

2006.05 --> 2013.36
tip Nicole Garland but look my show has

2008.39 --> 2017.9
been going for almost 300 episodes now I

2013.36 --> 2024.6499999999999
kind of tried that on a daily basis it's

2017.9 --> 2026.72
not doable for me I can't keep on

2024.65 --> 2030.67
dragging in themes it all really depends

2026.72 --> 2030.67
on what's been happening if I even

2030.73 --> 2037.1
sometimes I just get so busy with other

2034.01 --> 2041.23
stuff that I really don't even have too

2037.1 --> 2045.59
much ideas concerning Flat Earth to even

2041.23 --> 2047.21
bring up so but I will keep on doing the

2045.59 --> 2053.9
show every day and just talk about

2047.21 --> 2057.32
whatever news media narrative some yeah

2053.9 --> 2060.29
what it's a false flag or whatever

2057.32 --> 2062.48
although I tend to get demonetized every

2060.29 --> 2063.41
time I bring anything like that up it

2062.48 --> 2066.94
seems I've been

2063.41 --> 2066.94
demonetized with quite a few episodes

2069.19 --> 2074.32
yeah or Bible related things are

2074.71 --> 2079.94
unfortunately some social bickering

2077.6 --> 2082.2999999999997
situation or infighting I'll usually be

2079.94 --> 2082.3
sued

2088.32 --> 2094.4100000000003
Oh God

2098.89 --> 2105.68
so yeah and hey I because I have also

2103.579 --> 2108.77
said I'd love to take on guests but I

2105.68 --> 2113.23
don't know it may be the times slot or

2108.77 --> 2117.65
maybe I just a nerve a lot of people

2113.23 --> 2119.51
because I don't know I'm not getting a

2117.65 --> 2122.69
lot of people on and sometimes when I

2119.51 --> 2124.5200000000004
get them on I get a weird feeling like

2122.69 --> 2128.329
they're kind of nervous don't really

2124.52 --> 2131.27
know what to say like maybe they are

2128.329 --> 2133.869
almost afraid to say something maybe

2131.27 --> 2133.869
just me

2141.94 --> 2152.14
yeah well Nicole Garland I know that the

2145.15 --> 2155.799
its but that is because it's a different

2152.14 --> 2161.5589999999997
way to manage my energy I have much more

2155.799 --> 2163.66
time to really think heavily to myself

2161.559 --> 2165.6400000000003
now I constantly have to figure out like

2163.66 --> 2168.94
oh yeah I have to keep on talking I have

2165.64 --> 2170.98
to try to bring up subjects or respond

2168.94 --> 2173.4700000000003
to people like yeah I hate it when I

2170.98 --> 2176.049
have long pauses I really don't like

2173.47 --> 2177.7
that but it unfortunately does happen

2176.049 --> 2179.44
especially when weird stuff happens in

2177.7 --> 2184.45
chat and I get really distracted by it

2179.44 --> 2186.43
but it's very different from being on

2184.45 --> 2188.2889999999998
the debates because then there's

2186.43 --> 2193.7799999999997
somebody else keeping the show going and

2188.289 --> 2196.329
I can just wait my abide my time to just

2193.78 --> 2199.8390000000004
focus all that energy and have a much

2196.329 --> 2203.799
more concise very sharp was like

2199.839 --> 2206.89
weaponized response very quickly I don't

2203.799 --> 2208.21
have the momentum for that here well

2206.89 --> 2210.3089999999997
sometimes when I have a really good

2208.21 --> 2212.109
point then suddenly I have a little bit

2210.309 --> 2215.23
more energy and it can kind of do the

2212.109 --> 2217.99
same thing but just have muscles somehow

2215.23 --> 2221.89
arrive naturally for that to be

2217.99 --> 2225.3999999999996
established but for me to basically set

2221.89 --> 2228.67
up kind of like an amusement structure a

2225.4 --> 2235.42
program for me to hop from one segment

2228.67 --> 2238.869
to another that would be kind of

2235.42 --> 2240.4300000000003
unnatural to me unless well there's no

2238.869 --> 2242.799
other way yeah unless somebody would

2240.43 --> 2245.77
kind of give me sort of a script but

2242.799 --> 2248.2599999999998
then I'd be more a news reader type

2245.77 --> 2250.089
figure and I could do that as well in

2248.26 --> 2252.5200000000004
another way and that would be more like

2250.089 --> 2257.2
bullet points and then talk about it I

2252.52 --> 2259.299
can do that but I don't want to do that

2257.2 --> 2261.7599999999998
for myself because I don't see the

2259.299 --> 2263.65
purpose of it you start recycling old

2261.76 --> 2267.099
[ __ ] you start to fall into certain

2263.65 --> 2270.19
paths and you become a repeater robot

2267.099 --> 2272.529
and I really don't like that because

2270.19 --> 2274.96
she's you can stead you get set in your

2272.529 --> 2277.51
ways a lot when you do that

2274.96 --> 2279.819
look at Alex Jones is just completely

2277.51 --> 2282.6600000000003
railroaded the [ __ ] out of himself with

2279.819 --> 2288.609
almost everything must be very

2282.66 --> 2291.25
uncomfortable this so I want to keep it

2288.609 --> 2292.69
kind of free as long as I am just in

2291.25 --> 2295.63
direct control of the show and there's

2292.69 --> 2299.289
no real heavy necessity to completely

2295.63 --> 2302.079
change everything around to keep on

2299.289 --> 2308.3190000000004
improvising in order for the sudden gems

2302.079 --> 2309.789
to keep on dropping for the moments but

2308.319 --> 2312.93
it's very different from being on the

2309.789 --> 2312.9300000000003
flat earth debates I know

2327.75 --> 2331.97
hmm thanks Nicole garden

2341.79 --> 2346.44
social and political commentary got

2356.03 --> 2361.6000000000004
keep it fresh yeah I do my best to keep

2358.82 --> 2361.6000000000004
it fresh indeed

2367.75 --> 2375.23
Dave Johnson where the tides when if

2371.51 --> 2377.2400000000002
water finds it level why are there tides

2375.23 --> 2380.21
well because there's other forces being

2377.24 --> 2382.91
applied to the water locally as is

2380.21 --> 2391.0
literally measured and registered and

2382.91 --> 2391.0
brought into 3d mapping the tide chart

2392.77 --> 2403.13
so why it still doesn't undo that water

2399.29 --> 2404.96
actually does find its level it's just

2403.13 --> 2406.9
other things pushing towards it and then

2404.96 --> 2410.18
suddenly it starts displacing and then

2406.9 --> 2415.9100000000003
moves back again and it circulates the

2410.18 --> 2418.3599999999997
direction the push rotates more signs of

2415.91 --> 2418.3599999999997
the ether

2424.099 --> 2432.1090000000004
I'm starting to find some kind of weird

2426.65 --> 2434.599
new angle to the ether and I'm at this

2432.109 --> 2437.989
point completely improvising but I think

2434.599 --> 2442.1600000000003
there is a clue that if something some

2437.989 --> 2446.989
energy side effect something magnetic

2442.16 --> 2449.8999999999996
something ether base the energy that can

2446.989 --> 2452.359
be harnessed by for example magnetics in

2449.9 --> 2456.259
order to manifest that thinking that

2452.359 --> 2458.799
this ether in rotates rotates at the

2456.259 --> 2461.839
kind of constant speed everywhere

2458.799 --> 2465.92
throughout the realm so if there is a

2461.839 --> 2469.549
natural effect and it rotates steadily

2465.92 --> 2473.7490000000003
and that's a lot of things okay

2469.549 --> 2477.41
I am saying right now that is in my

2473.749 --> 2480.709
opinion a big hint that it is cost or

2477.41 --> 2483.89
directly tied into the ether because the

2480.709 --> 2486.6189999999997
ether seems to be rotating so that could

2483.89 --> 2490.069
be all of the heavenly body seems even

2486.619 --> 2493.509
since even the moon and the Sun rotate

2490.069 --> 2500.869
and other heavenly bodies seem to rotate

2493.509 --> 2505.849
mm-hmm and the tides they rotate so all

2500.869 --> 2509.599
these things seem in my opinion to be

2505.849 --> 2514.789
related to the ether caused by it in

2509.599 --> 2518.779
some way directly or indirectly so that

2514.789 --> 2521.509
is my preliminary insight on this this

2518.779 --> 2524.14
new insight and I don't know where it's

2521.509 --> 2524.14
gonna go yet

2533.83 --> 2544.12
around what no Rasta the ether rotates

2539.49 --> 2546.3999999999996
around it's kind of like a polarization

2544.12 --> 2549.64
direction it just wrote the direction of

2546.4 --> 2553.06
the energy that is throughout the realm

2549.64 --> 2555.5499999999997
seems to rotate so it is rotating but it

2553.06 --> 2560.19
rotates everywhere wherever it manifests

2555.55 --> 2565.48
it rotates so it is just a universal

2560.19 --> 2567.31
direction and it seems to rotate and

2565.48 --> 2569.98
whenever you capture it it has a

2567.31 --> 2573.46
tendency to rotate that is what it seems

2569.98 --> 2579.85
to be like so it is just everywhere and

2573.46 --> 2583.69
it rotates everywhere you know it is

2579.85 --> 2586.45
kind of like imagine the direction it

2583.69 --> 2589.98
rotates right so something is here it's

2586.45 --> 2593.1699999999996
that same direction it rotates it's here

2589.98 --> 2595.3
because it's still technically part of

2593.17 --> 2600.09
the same thing because it's all rotating

2595.3 --> 2603.79
simultaneously so that is how I am

2600.09 --> 2605.6200000000003
starting to figure out the some of the

2603.79 --> 2608.92
electrical nature of the natural

2605.62 --> 2613.89
phenomena in the world in the world now

2608.92 --> 2617.1
X is the axis is everywhere it's a field

2613.89 --> 2619.96
or not even a field it's just a

2617.1 --> 2625.33
direction a universal direction you

2619.96 --> 2628.89
could say and that universal direction

2625.33 --> 2628.89
is the direction the

2631.86 --> 2638.9100000000003
of the ether subtle energy I don't know

2637.47 --> 2641.5699999999997
I'm getting lost in heat trying to

2638.91 --> 2641.5699999999997
explain it now

2656.83 --> 2662.94
oh thanks for the super chat donation by

2659.08 --> 2662.94
the way gaining wisdom much appreciated

2664.89 --> 2670.66
but yeah I'm thinking about it also I'd

2667.99 --> 2677.8599999999997
like to talk this idea over with some

2670.66 --> 2681.3999999999996
others that would be yeah no not a

2677.86 --> 2685.38
rotating everywhere I'm saying the ether

2681.4 --> 2685.38
is everywhere and it is rotating

2690.37 --> 2699.8199999999997
remember it's what supposedly Bob

2695.5 --> 2703.15
actually proved or well what he thinks

2699.82 --> 2704.8
he proved the proof what is proof where

2703.15 --> 2706.51
the ballers assume that he proved the

2704.8 --> 2710.44
rotation of the earth while he proved

2706.51 --> 2717.4300000000003
the rotation of light of the guiding

2710.44 --> 2720.03
force of light and that is presumed to

2717.43 --> 2720.0299999999997
be the ether

2732.089 --> 2740.839
right but look this ether whatever it is

2736.769 --> 2743.6989999999996
I don't even know if it is a thing

2740.839 --> 2746.939
because yeah I'm kind of already

2743.699 --> 2750.539
presuming that to assume directly that

2746.939 --> 2752.7889999999998
it is a thing maybe jumping onto an

2750.539 --> 2756.029
aberration kind of like gravity but

2752.789 --> 2758.8190000000004
there is something to the energy

2756.029 --> 2763.099
manifestation and that there is a

2758.819 --> 2766.049
rotating nature to this so that is now

2763.099 --> 2769.199
by lack of better understanding called

2766.049 --> 2773.91
the ether there is something there doing

2769.199 --> 2777.319
that and that that idea I am

2773.91 --> 2777.319
entertaining at the moment

2781.95 --> 2790.8199999999997
no rest stop don't be a dick

2786.39 --> 2797.97
please end up rotating everywhere I

2790.82 --> 2800.78
explained it very well to you don't be a

2797.97 --> 2800.7799999999997
troll please

2810.349 --> 2813.309
stop it

2821.53 --> 2825.9100000000003
they're not rotating in the opposite

2823.75 --> 2828.01
direction spare room music they're

2825.91 --> 2831.0099999999998
rotating in the same direction it's just

2828.01 --> 2833.7400000000002
if you orientate yourself to look in the

2831.01 --> 2835.51
other direction then in relation to you

2833.74 --> 2837.79
as the observer they're rotating in

2835.51 --> 2841.21
another direction but in the ORAC

2837.79 --> 2842.95
Universal orientation of the world they

2841.21 --> 2845.44
are going in the both in the same

2842.95 --> 2849.0299999999997
direction so that's just a

2845.44 --> 2849.03
misunderstanding on your part

2859.59 --> 2862.9390000000003
[Music]

2872.88 --> 2879.51
what

2875.43 --> 2884.25
yeah well you know Dave Johnson this is

2879.51 --> 2885.7200000000003
getting annoying YouTube why why no one

2884.25 --> 2887.67
can go to the moon it's so difficult

2885.72 --> 2890.299
well it's because it's not there it's

2887.67 --> 2895.26
not a physical thing you can land off on

2890.299 --> 2897.24
why do you think it's difficult it's

2895.26 --> 2898.92
kind of difficult to land on something

2897.24 --> 2901.9799999999996
that is not actually a thing you can

2898.92 --> 2905.549
land on how do you propose to land on a

2901.98 --> 2907.349
hologram that is only visible at an

2905.549 --> 2909.24
apparent distance in relation to the

2907.349 --> 2912.75
observer it's going to be kind of

2909.24 --> 2914.8489999999997
difficult oh really well I'd like to see

2912.75 --> 2920.099
some proximity proof then spare-room

2914.849 --> 2922.289
music show me the proximity show me

2920.099 --> 2926.599
getting closer to the moon and not

2922.289 --> 2929.9700000000003
through some weird CGI [ __ ] from NASA

2926.599 --> 2932.819
and you have a proximity something

2929.97 --> 2935.3999999999996
actually approaching it a camera

2932.819 --> 2939.529
approaching it see what happens well

2935.4 --> 2942.2400000000002
it's bending away hmm why could that be

2939.529 --> 2946.609
seemed like it was right there and now

2942.24 --> 2950.7299999999996
it's over there hmm

2946.609 --> 2952.859
yeah because it stays at the edge of

2950.73 --> 2956.4
vision always because it's not a

2952.859 --> 2958.609
physical thing you can land on try it

2956.4 --> 2958.609
out

2959.7 --> 2967.71
a proximity that means a confirmed

2964.38 --> 2971.13
distance proximity if you have a

2967.71 --> 2973.98
proximity then you have basically a

2971.13 --> 2976.76
confirmation of a distance between you

2973.98 --> 2976.76
and something

2978.02 --> 2981.21
[Music]

2996.54 --> 3002.02
yeah

2998.31 --> 3002.02
good luck with your space dreams

3006.45 --> 3012.6099999999997
[Music]

3013.57 --> 3016.17
what

3024.79 --> 3031.77
okay Dave Johnson it's that's enough

3032.73 --> 3042.13
okay you're in the code so don't you go

3036.19 --> 3043.78
accusing us here I don't want to just go

3042.13 --> 3047.53
yelling back and forth

3043.78 --> 3052.0
cult cult cults because you kind of are

3047.53 --> 3054.34
what do you realize it or not and we

3052.0 --> 3056.19
have much more proof that you are in

3054.34 --> 3059.04
contradiction to the other way around

3056.19 --> 3061.59
still based on a lot of weird

3059.04 --> 3069.19
aberrations false claims nonsense so

3061.59 --> 3071.6400000000003
yeah bouncing lasers still a lot of talk

3069.19 --> 3071.64
no action

3075.82 --> 3079.56
bouncing lasers right

3079.91 --> 3085.609
yeah it's always gonna go back with my

3082.309 --> 3088.539
AM radio can actually bounce a signal

3085.609 --> 3091.4
off the moon they never actually show it

3088.539 --> 3094.4900000000002
they just say oh look the machine it's

3091.4 --> 3096.4700000000003
doing it they don't change it don't look

3094.49 --> 3099.7099999999996
like oh wait look if you move it right

3096.47 --> 3102.98
beside it it doesn't do that anymore

3099.71 --> 3104.869
sadly you will dip no reflection oh no

3102.98 --> 3106.97
they don't do that never seen that no

3104.869 --> 3110.2690000000002
now you just got to trust the guys with

3106.97 --> 3112.49
the radios because in general people

3110.269 --> 3115.22
associating with radio are super

3112.49 --> 3117.019
reliable not biased towards the globe at

3115.22 --> 3119.24
all being involved in pretty much a

3117.019 --> 3129.6499999999996
cultural revolution of introducing it in

3119.24 --> 3134.089
the Western public or anything right

3129.65 --> 3137.029
so hey but I'm open to do it myself if

3134.089 --> 3139.819
you got if you got one I'll do it on

3137.029 --> 3142.549
camera do exactly what I just described

3139.819 --> 3144.92
hey and if there is something weirdly

3142.549 --> 3147.619
enough some kind of radio bounce of the

3144.92 --> 3150.23
moon or of where the apparent disk is

3147.619 --> 3154.509
visible well I'd be curious to figure

3150.23 --> 3158.509
out what what is going on at that point

3154.509 --> 3163.279
and would it work with other light

3158.509 --> 3167.839
phenomena as well but to be fair I

3163.279 --> 3169.91
really haven't had any kind of real

3167.839 --> 3172.8089999999997
proof other than just stories just like

3169.91 --> 3175.819
with the Coriolis sniper bullet nonsense

3172.809 --> 3177.619
other than that level of evidence I

3175.819 --> 3182.779
haven't had any kind of real proof that

3177.619 --> 3186.2200000000003
that actually works it's just a yeah a

3182.779 --> 3186.22
radio myth

3186.32 --> 3195.8900000000003
as far as I'm concerned yeah well

3192.89 --> 3200.81
provide it I don't have money for all

3195.89 --> 3202.96
that [ __ ] okay and hey if every guy with

3200.81 --> 3207.5299999999997
the ham radio wants to invite me over

3202.96 --> 3210.05
behind me if they very close then I'll

3207.53 --> 3217.15
come over I'll do it with your life on

3210.05 --> 3217.15
video streaming live no problem

3217.45 --> 3224.1499999999996
I'm hoping for that I have been open for

3220.28 --> 3226.6400000000003
that for a long time but I'm not open

3224.15 --> 3228.8
for people just nothing - no it does it

3226.64 --> 3232.67
I've seen it a little bit bla your

3228.8 --> 3234.92
stupid flutter through [ __ ] no no I'll

3232.67 --> 3238.39
be open to actually do it where I am

3234.92 --> 3242.21
there and actually having control over

3238.39 --> 3244.7
what can be done I'll do it all on

3242.21 --> 3248.21
camera so everybody can see what is

3244.7 --> 3250.85
happening what is being done there's no

3248.21 --> 3254.41
trickery going on I'll do it

3250.85 --> 3254.41
no problem

3266.32 --> 3272.4700000000003
all right yeah

3272.62 --> 3279.96
yeah you come in with that kind of name

3276.61 --> 3279.96
I'm gonna ban you anyways

3302.6 --> 3305.17
it

3305.84 --> 3313.4700000000003
now well rust out look if look there may

3311.1 --> 3317.79
be just more going on than I understand

3313.47 --> 3321.24
okay so maybe moonlight in its full

3317.79 --> 3323.82
attend city could do something to alter

3321.24 --> 3326.1
radio waves perhaps as I have even

3323.82 --> 3328.3500000000004
suggested with the potential or the

3326.1 --> 3333.77
experiments trying to prove that

3328.35 --> 3335.85
moonlight could accelerate entropy

3333.77 --> 3338.61
transfer of heat well maybe it could do

3335.85 --> 3341.52
other things I don't know but the thing

3338.61 --> 3343.8900000000003
is I've never even reached that step of

3341.52 --> 3347.25
confirming that ham radio even does

3343.89 --> 3349.29
anything supposedly and then work out

3347.25 --> 3351.75
theoretically how that can work you know

3349.29 --> 3354.5099999999998
how much energy do you have to pump in

3351.75 --> 3356.97
the damn thing to actually even be

3354.51 --> 3360.1800000000003
theoretically able to reach that moon

3356.97 --> 3362.7
and reflected it it won't make any sense

3360.18 --> 3365.6099999999997
anyway but if there is some kind of

3362.7 --> 3367.9199999999996
weird aberration going on where it seems

3365.61 --> 3371.55
to be reflecting something well that may

3367.92 --> 3374.7000000000003
be just interesting look even if it

3371.55 --> 3378.9300000000003
would do that I'm not even just going to

3374.7 --> 3381.27
say oh my god the ham radio reflected

3378.93 --> 3384.96
off the moon I was so wrong and the

3381.27 --> 3387.42
earth is not a flattish of lobes because

3384.96 --> 3391.46
the freakin ham radio bounced of the

3387.42 --> 3395.55
moon no but it would just be very

3391.46 --> 3398.94
interesting to see if it even is more

3395.55 --> 3406.25
than just another [ __ ] story just

3398.94 --> 3406.25
like the Coriolis bullets so we'll see

3413.11 --> 3416.55
[Music]

3420.49 --> 3424.47
[Music]

3428.089 --> 3436.849
I'm a radio nice one Reza oh right the

3433.05 --> 3436.849
looks rather like a chicken lack radio

3438.14 --> 3444.45
anyway I think I'm gonna be rounding out

3441.0 --> 3447.599
the show now because yeah it's almost 3

3444.45 --> 3454.9399999999996
o'clock Amsterdam time and the debates

3447.599 --> 3454.94

3467.94 --> 3470.78
