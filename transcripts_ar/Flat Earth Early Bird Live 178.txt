6.67 --> 37.97
[Music]

209.43 --> 214.73000000000002
oh my god you're only telling me this

214.019 --> 222.659
now

214.73 --> 226.22
are you serious you guys are you serious

222.659 --> 230.159
damn seriously this button here this

226.22 --> 236.25
this mute button it's weird

230.159 --> 241.53
sometimes I click it but it does now now

236.25 --> 244.7
it worked and work it's really annoying

241.53 --> 247.7
when it the button doesn't work properly

244.7 --> 247.7
sheesh

252.709 --> 259.22
so yeah okay that first four minutes was

256.35 --> 263.94
completely muted that's just great

259.22 --> 265.59000000000003
thanks that no only AGM now after four

263.94 --> 267.99
minutes pretty much was saying it oh

265.59 --> 270.19899999999996
yeah he was saying it before but if just

267.99 --> 273.18
one person is telling me then

270.199 --> 276.33000000000004
yeah I'm it's very easy to overlook guys

273.18 --> 281.61
so would be nice the next time if you

276.33 --> 290.69899999999996
see like a like all please start telling

281.61 --> 293.72900000000004
me please unless you like this oh god

290.699 --> 295.979
and patron Levin actually he's his spam

293.729 --> 298.139
was sound but his letters were apart so

295.979 --> 300.78
I didn't see it first point great so

298.139 --> 303.169
yeah that was a messy start good morning

300.78 --> 304.979
welcome to flat earth early-bird number

303.169 --> 307.889
178 I'm your host

304.979 --> 310.289
Arwen and before we start the show don't

307.889 --> 312.33
forget to share it and if you haven't

310.289 --> 313.949
already subscribed to my channel and hit

312.33 --> 315.35999999999996
the bell notifications so you know when

313.949 --> 315.72
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

315.36 --> 320.82
p.m.

315.72 --> 322.53000000000003
Amsterdam time and today as you saw on

320.82 --> 326.37
the footage already it's a pretty nice

322.53 --> 329.76
day it's warm it's a slow breeze but

326.37 --> 332.13
it's a warm wind and it's not raining

329.76 --> 336.99
it's a little bit cloudy here and there

332.13 --> 339.40999999999997
and sunny in between and yeah there's a

336.99 --> 342.29
lot of people in chat

339.41 --> 345.47
and I shouted out each and every one of

342.29 --> 352.34000000000003
you and I don't feel like doing that all

345.47 --> 354.58000000000004
over again sorry but yeah thank you all

352.34 --> 354.58
for coming

359.819 --> 370.569
mmm that's annoying right so sorry for

367.989 --> 379.479
the messy start at least you did get to

370.569 --> 382.089
hear the early bird song and right I'm

379.479 --> 385.019
completely off track now anyway I was a

382.089 --> 393.429
bit late because I was up pretty late

385.019 --> 396.059
kept on watching stuff and I can feel it

393.429 --> 396.05899999999997
that's weird

403.4 --> 409.07
so it's almost like I've broken a little

406.04 --> 415.25
with my early rhythm and I'm not really

409.07 --> 419.75
in the like of that right oh yeah Owen

415.25 --> 424.27
Benjamin is keep on amping up the moon

419.75 --> 424.27
thing and he had a really interesting

425.05 --> 431.12
talk again with a another guy I'm

428.06 --> 433.16
terrible at names but yeah flat earth

431.12 --> 436.1
came up and the other guy was extremely

433.16 --> 438.47
skeptic with that and they were like oh

436.1 --> 442.87
yeah geostationary geostationary but it

438.47 --> 446.02000000000004
must be a globe it's it's very typical

442.87 --> 451.28000000000003
but yeah I saw that kind of thing

446.02 --> 455.77
geocentrism with a globe it was even

451.28 --> 455.77
yeah mentioned at least in the 90s

456.07 --> 463.07
people aren't as allergic to it as to

459.08 --> 466.039
Flat Earth so yeah that was good and

463.07 --> 468.4
then he did a little joke piece about

466.039 --> 473.599
the moon again

468.4 --> 479.38899999999995
I visited Maarten lettuce from here

473.599 --> 481.789
yesterday more footage let's see what

479.389 --> 484.669
else was there oh yeah and I mentioned

481.789 --> 485.96
for a moment yeah well I look like I

484.669 --> 489.79999999999995
just can't help it

485.96 --> 492.73999999999995
I keep on watching Alex Jones and it's a

489.8 --> 494.72
lot of advertisement for good products

492.74 --> 496.16
but it's really annoying to constantly

494.72 --> 499.66900000000004
be hearing about that when you don't

496.16 --> 501.889
have the money to buy that [ __ ] but yeah

499.669 --> 503.419
he's bringing out new stuff every once

501.889 --> 506.99
in a while and now he has an improvement

503.419 --> 509.93
to the b12 product that he had so yeah I

506.99 --> 515.39
am again curious he did it again goodie

509.93 --> 519.19
but anyway it was an interesting moment

515.39 --> 519.1899999999999
at some point it was during

520.819 --> 528.779
yeah it was during the the info war show

524.339 --> 532.589
itself and something about CNN was

528.779 --> 536.1
brought up and was very funny it was

532.589 --> 537.749
very much about narrative and mind

536.1 --> 540.98
control mindset it was a very

537.749 --> 545.879
interesting couple of hours I thought

540.98 --> 547.529
most of it and although much of it I've

545.879 --> 549.66
already heard pretty much but at some

547.529 --> 551.79
point let's see it was hilarious because

549.66 --> 554.85
they were bringing up like yeah like

551.79 --> 556.98
even the people at CNN they can't hold

554.85 --> 560.5790000000001
on to their line narrative that was

556.98 --> 564.239
basically the typical Infowars angle but

560.579 --> 566.459
then they showed a clip about I think it

564.239 --> 569.0400000000001
was seen a know maybe was ABC one of

566.459 --> 570.929
these typical mainstream news agencies

569.04 --> 573.059
sorry so it may not have been seen and

570.929 --> 575.97
I'm not sure but they were talking about

573.059 --> 578.249
how they sent in investigators into

575.97 --> 581.1600000000001
conspiracy theories to figure out what's

578.249 --> 584.8190000000001
going on and then they said that a large

581.16 --> 587.79
percentage of those people would

584.819 --> 589.86
actually start to believe for real the

587.79 --> 591.9889999999999
conspiracy they were investigating and

589.86 --> 596.369
then they mentioned the conspiracies and

591.989 --> 598.35
Flat Earth was among them and they were

596.369 --> 600.239
like even as they said it they were

598.35 --> 604.35
shocked that that was seemed to be the

600.239 --> 607.769
case it was and that was all info war so

604.35 --> 612.899
that was just one of those amazing

607.769 --> 618.089
moments a multi-layer narrative moment

612.899 --> 623.429
where it all shows it's it was magic to

618.089 --> 626.97
me amazing amazing that that happened so

623.429 --> 631.47
I hope to somehow get that piece it's it

626.97 --> 635.009
will probably it'll be maybe one to five

631.47 --> 637.3190000000001
minutes at most but would be awesome to

635.009 --> 638.339
have that as a clip I will if I can

637.319 --> 641.459
catch it somehow

638.339 --> 644.4590000000001
I will definitely post that on my

641.459 --> 647.78
channel because it was just very cool

644.459 --> 651.2299999999999
and typical

647.78 --> 653.63
like oh yeah investigators go to look

651.23 --> 658.79
into Flat Earth and then after a while

653.63 --> 662.6899999999999
they come back like I I am unsure but I

658.79 --> 664.43
think I believe this I can't counter

662.69 --> 668.6
argue with them and they are very

664.43 --> 673.64
informed and yeah that's what happens

668.6 --> 675.9200000000001
Flat Earth it's amazing ah so that that

673.64 --> 678.86
was a very good moment I hope to share

675.92 --> 682.79
it somewhere in the near future on my

678.86 --> 685.16
channel although a flat earth wasn't the

682.79 --> 688.5799999999999
only one it was also about I think they

685.16 --> 694.9699999999999
mentioned also Sandy Hook and false

688.58 --> 700.46
flags and all kinds of the the newer

694.97 --> 702.89
fields of the the alternative conspiracy

700.46 --> 708.74
theory line of thinking surrounding

702.89 --> 710.6
false flags and all that and right what

708.74 --> 714.08
Alex Jones used to deal with mostly

710.6 --> 717.32
still does but more politicized so that

714.08 --> 722.35
and mentioning a whole few in a robot

717.32 --> 722.35
Flat Earth among them it was really cool

730.43 --> 734.3299999999999
okay let's let's see what people are

732.83 --> 737.1700000000001
talking about have been ranting on about

734.33 --> 737.1700000000001
this long enough

750.17 --> 757.89
Yeah right okay

753.5 --> 762.69
pumpkin pumpkin puffs Johnson really

757.89 --> 764.58
that's I love a creative name but yeah

762.69 --> 768.0
concave earth yeah

764.58 --> 773.1600000000001
look I've entertained concave earth

768.0 --> 777.48
before flat earth even but there's this

773.16 --> 781.0799999999999
thing about it and that is it should be

777.48 --> 785.7
very noticeable unless the concavity of

781.08 --> 788.5200000000001
the earth is gigantic like much larger

785.7 --> 796.47
than our earth realm because we don't

788.52 --> 798.99
see curvature we really don't so that's

796.47 --> 801.51
why I'm not a concave ER because hey if

798.99 --> 805.74
concave could be entertained then so

801.51 --> 807.75
could a globe and that's the whole thing

805.74 --> 810.39
why stick to the flat because there is

807.75 --> 816.05
no curvature and no concavity curvature

810.39 --> 819.63
either it's just no proof of this and

816.05 --> 823.77
there is no models in any flag you might

819.63 --> 826.8
have taken notice that flags are 2d

823.77 --> 831.21
prints so the best you could put on a

826.8 --> 834.92
flag is a map and all maps that we know

831.21 --> 838.3100000000001
are projections they're not models so

834.92 --> 844.5
this whole thing has just been giant ly

838.31 --> 847.56
misconstrued Mis yeah it's all of you

844.5 --> 850.11
guys are a mess or a lot of you just

847.56 --> 852.3
assuming all these things you don't even

850.11 --> 854.4
understand the origin you don't

852.3 --> 857.18
understand the technicalities of the

854.4 --> 857.18
origins

864.18 --> 879.31
but yeah I'd if concave okay if it was

873.76 --> 885.33
it just now look I don't think it's ever

879.31 --> 887.8299999999999
going to be literally concave that just

885.33 --> 892.26
doesn't make any sense with relative

887.83 --> 894.5500000000001
density and if it's like a hollow globe

892.26 --> 897.79
which it would have to be if there's

894.55 --> 903.0999999999999
consistent curvature in all directions

897.79 --> 904.29
yeah concave curvature then there would

903.1 --> 908.62
ya

904.29 --> 911.98
the then supposed centrifugal force

908.62 --> 915.28
would not be capable of distributing the

911.98 --> 919.45
force equally so that would make it very

915.28 --> 922.54
weird Warped type of sis's yeah system

919.45 --> 926.47
so the only way a concave system in any

922.54 --> 928.66
fashion could exist is in a in an Ida

926.47 --> 934.62
string or whatever whatever it's called

928.66 --> 939.91
it's basically a tube that is spinning

934.62 --> 941.89
it's yeah Babylon 5 the space station in

939.91 --> 945.31
the science fiction series of the 90s

941.89 --> 948.88
that is basically a very small-scale

945.31 --> 952.4499999999999
version of a conceptualization of a

948.88 --> 955.21
concave earth system it's very amazing

952.45 --> 957.5500000000001
how they in the 90s with CGI managed to

955.21 --> 963.34
show how that kind of looked is very

957.55 --> 965.26
very fascinating hmm so yeah that is the

963.34 --> 967.72
only concave model that I've ever

965.26 --> 973.78
entertained but it still would be on a

967.72 --> 974.76
fast earth much bigger than our known

973.78 --> 979.0899999999999
realm

974.76 --> 981.43
so if our non realm is the only realm

979.09 --> 984.01
then the only solution is that it's flat

981.43 --> 986.67
or we would see curvature of some kind

984.01 --> 986.67
and we don't

986.85 --> 991.47
so that summarizes it I think

997.33 --> 1004.219
[Music]

1005.61 --> 1015.16
now Sam Bovie a model is a model it's a

1010.48 --> 1017.11
combination of elements to make it all

1015.16 --> 1019.54
work out with all the physics and

1017.11 --> 1023.98
everything and all the elements that are

1019.54 --> 1032.98
present that's a model and a map is not

1023.98 --> 1035.68
a model it's a projection so to say that

1032.98 --> 1040.6
a flag would have a model on it is a

1035.68 --> 1042.91
ridiculous concept it's misunderstanding

1040.6 --> 1046.6
what a model is it a look that map

1042.91 --> 1049.99
remind you of your model that you based

1046.6 --> 1054.6699999999998
on the presupposition that that map is

1049.99 --> 1057.58
somehow literal and you don't understand

1054.67 --> 1068.5500000000002
the nature of projection based card

1057.58 --> 1073.6599999999999
cartography so I I say the world is not

1068.55 --> 1075.85
the projection in it's not the scale you

1073.66 --> 1078.13
can only really portray it in a

1075.85 --> 1081.25
realistic fashion is if everything is

1078.13 --> 1084.3700000000001
the scale and if it then doesn't make

1081.25 --> 1087.06
sense to you how it all works out well

1084.37 --> 1091.6599999999999
then that's your problem because that is

1087.06 --> 1094.36
to scale so that is the most realistic

1091.66 --> 1096.63
way you could portray them and one of

1094.36 --> 1099.61
the ways that I conceptualized is

1096.63 --> 1107.13
rectangular looping and that immediately

1099.61 --> 1107.1299999999999
fixes it so

1107.36 --> 1115.32
and who knows look I'm not saying this

1111.42 --> 1119.13
is true I'm saying this is a concept but

1115.32 --> 1121.29
in the end because it can be tested to

1119.13 --> 1122.5200000000002
be true or false in the end it might

1121.29 --> 1125.7
have turned out to be an aberration

1122.52 --> 1131.059
because aberrations tend to pop up when

1125.7 --> 1134.25
you dig into new fields thinking is very

1131.059 --> 1136.77
easy solutions and this to me seemed

1134.25 --> 1141.0
like a very easy solution it's just kind

1136.77 --> 1142.429
of surreal thinking you have to yeah you

1141.0 --> 1144.9
have to have some kind of

1142.429 --> 1149.0700000000002
conceptualization of it in order to get

1144.9 --> 1151.799
it but technically it fixes things very

1149.07 --> 1154.549
easily but it might turn out in the end

1151.799 --> 1159.24
just like gravity to be an aberration

1154.549 --> 1164.429
really you can only know once you can

1159.24 --> 1171.63
really confirm it or not that's that's

1164.429 --> 1174.959
how I experience science okay

1171.63 --> 1174.959
[Music]

1178.61 --> 1187.6589999999999
[Music]

1180.72 --> 1191.049
it's a rat's AGM you're in a weird mood

1187.659 --> 1194.46
today see again says I think you need a

1191.049 --> 1197.009
little Jewish princess myself mate what

1194.46 --> 1200.22
[Music]

1197.009 --> 1200.22
that is

1206.149 --> 1218.9889999999998
that is just weird misty cockney tea you

1212.599 --> 1224.869
know the answer to that look gravity is

1218.989 --> 1229.909
a aberrational framework it's a

1224.869 --> 1232.849
framework a structure to replace proven

1229.909 --> 1236.3890000000001
effects and tie it all together in an

1232.849 --> 1239.539
easy instrument an easy conceptualising

1236.389 --> 1243.9689999999998
instrument a calculation tool that's

1239.539 --> 1248.079
what gravity is it's a tool but it's not

1243.969 --> 1254.419
proven thing so relative density that's

1248.079 --> 1259.069
why things fall and falling is even it's

1254.419 --> 1262.749
a more subjective approach to it because

1259.069 --> 1262.749
technically it displaces

1269.93 --> 1278.7
right well what makes things drop is

1273.59 --> 1281.55
those things the yeah their relative

1278.7 --> 1285.95
density and if their relative density is

1281.55 --> 1289.8
out of place you could say or not add

1285.95 --> 1291.6000000000001
its relative density la equilibrium

1289.8 --> 1296.46
point within the spectrum of all things

1291.6 --> 1301.1399999999999
mainly the medium determines this then

1296.46 --> 1304.6200000000001
it will tend to move it will tend to

1301.14 --> 1309.3000000000002
displace unless the maneuverability is

1304.62 --> 1311.61
not does not allow it then it will stay

1309.3 --> 1317.94
where it is it yeah

1311.61 --> 1325.6799999999998
the friction you could call it would be

1317.94 --> 1328.8300000000002
basically countering the displacement so

1325.68 --> 1333.8700000000001
yeah relative density this equilibrium

1328.83 --> 1336.27
is what spawns forth the force the

1333.87 --> 1340.11
acceleration of objects under specific

1336.27 --> 1342.93
conditions that is that it the object is

1340.11 --> 1345.09
not at its at its equilibrium point in

1342.93 --> 1346.8500000000001
the first place well that is it being at

1345.09 --> 1349.7099999999998
this equilibrium and the manoeuvrability

1346.85 --> 1353.04
so the maneuverability is very important

1349.71 --> 1356.67
and it's funny because in the original

1353.04 --> 1360.48
gravity conceptualization of it air

1356.67 --> 1363.54
friction is also taken into account as a

1360.48 --> 1367.13
specific factor and so maneuverability

1363.54 --> 1367.1299999999999
in air friction correlate

1374.22 --> 1385.6200000000001
well X 320 there look material does not

1382.42 --> 1389.19
have knowledge okay

1385.62 --> 1392.76
it either is at an equilibrium point

1389.19 --> 1397.5700000000002
with its surroundings or it is not and

1392.76 --> 1401.26
if it is not then force will come into

1397.57 --> 1403.03
being because of that causing

1401.26 --> 1405.87
displacement as long as there is

1403.03 --> 1405.87
maneuverability

1410.19 --> 1414.45
oh by the way thank you gaining wisdom

1412.38 --> 1441.3000000000002
for the $2 super chat donation much

1414.45 --> 1444.51
appreciated yeah I don't need a second

1441.3 --> 1446.78
coffee because I was up pretty late like

1444.51 --> 1449.76
12 o'clock today it's terrible

1446.78 --> 1459.81
yeah definitely don't want to keep this

1449.76 --> 1462.86
up right still got a half a strawberry

1459.81 --> 1462.86
jelly sandwich

1463.85 --> 1467.05
[Music]

1490.52 --> 1493.52
right

1499.68 --> 1505.1100000000001
yeah well if you look relative density

1502.86 --> 1509.1899999999998
again look if you want to approach this

1505.11 --> 1513.4799999999998
in a colloquial not so scientific way

1509.19 --> 1515.55
then yes what effectively happens is the

1513.48 --> 1519.39
more than something is it will go in one

1515.55 --> 1522.4199999999998
direction right directions are basically

1519.39 --> 1525.39
subjective but yeah we share this

1522.42 --> 1529.14
objective thing in our experience

1525.39 --> 1531.23
especially if we don't go under the

1529.14 --> 1535.94
assumption that the earth is a ball

1531.23 --> 1538.38
right because otherwise the yeah that

1535.94 --> 1544.52
conceptualization becomes especially

1538.38 --> 1547.5
relative supposedly anyway have ya the

1544.52 --> 1552.15
dancer goes down and the lesser dance

1547.5 --> 1554.97
goes up if there is maneuvering room but

1552.15 --> 1558.8300000000002
the up and the down can be more

1554.97 --> 1563.24
scientifically explained as being the

1558.83 --> 1568.6499999999999
equity density spectrum of all things at

1563.24 --> 1570.38
which specific objects can be in an

1568.65 --> 1575.0600000000002
equilibrium or in a disequilibrium

1570.38 --> 1575.0600000000002
depending on whatever matter is present

1576.47 --> 1583.38
like an object any object can either go

1579.75 --> 1585.93
up stay exactly where it is or move down

1583.38 --> 1588.96
depending on its density in relation to

1585.93 --> 1595.8300000000002
its surrounding if that is a gas or a

1588.96 --> 1598.52
liquid and that counts for solid as well

1595.83 --> 1598.52
as liquids

1604.08 --> 1611.52
okay it counts for it all basically

1606.21 --> 1613.6200000000001
although I do wonder there probably

1611.52 --> 1619.47
aren't technically this there shouldn't

1613.62 --> 1624.78
be any liquids that should ever be less

1619.47 --> 1628.98
dense than any gas but who know maybe

1624.78 --> 1631.8
maybe I'm mistaken somehow or maybe on

1628.98 --> 1632.79
the specific temperature conditions this

1631.8 --> 1636.69
yeah

1632.79 --> 1640.17
like certain gases do actually turn

1636.69 --> 1643.5900000000001
liquid while much heavier gases do not I

1640.17 --> 1646.0800000000002
don't know for sure I have no idea maybe

1643.59 --> 1648.3
that could be observed that actual

1646.08 --> 1651.6899999999998
liquid would be sitting on top of gas

1648.3 --> 1655.59
that will be so weird but it all all of

1651.69 --> 1657.78
it really depends on well the density

1655.59 --> 1664.4599999999998
compared to all the other densities

1657.78 --> 1664.46
surrounding it and thus relative density

1674.95 --> 1681.14
right star evict us why not to the site

1678.29 --> 1684.68
because that is how it works that's why

1681.14 --> 1689.98
the up and D down the spectrum of all

1684.68 --> 1693.6200000000001
things is it has an alignment it's not

1689.98 --> 1700.67
warped it's not bending it's layer layer

1693.62 --> 1708.62
layer its gradient spectrum has an axis

1700.67 --> 1714.5
and that axis can be pointed at from our

1708.62 --> 1717.32
subjective standpoint as up or down but

1714.5 --> 1728.84
we only do that because it just happens

1717.32 --> 1732.32
to be arranged this way so no there is

1728.84 --> 1735.31
nothing that gives you gravity gravity

1732.32 --> 1738.86
is superfluous it is a replacement

1735.31 --> 1741.95
overarching system that is scientism

1738.86 --> 1744.35
based that just ties together a lot of

1741.95 --> 1748.16
things that are scientifically based

1744.35 --> 1749.9599999999998
and then presupposes that it is that if

1748.16 --> 1752.3000000000002
the replacement of all those things

1749.96 --> 1756.8600000000001
while it itself is not scientifically

1752.3 --> 1761.6599999999999
provable so get over it okay I got over

1756.86 --> 1764.33
it years ago and I was a yeah a defender

1761.66 --> 1766.94
of gravity we're from within flat earth

1764.33 --> 1770.1499999999999
big time you remember the debates with

1766.94 --> 1774.44
Mia Riley had I get I got pretty heated

1770.15 --> 1782.0800000000002
but it's useless you can't prove it you

1774.44 --> 1782.0800000000002
have to what's it called again

1782.4 --> 1798.3200000000002
ah I can't find the right word yeah it's

1795.48 --> 1801.3
it's no use you have to give in it's

1798.32 --> 1806.24
it's not gonna work it's never gonna

1801.3 --> 1811.5
work it was never designed to be

1806.24 --> 1818.19
fulfilled it was always designed as

1811.5 --> 1820.65
broken as part of a religion that's what

1818.19 --> 1823.05
they planted it for at the early start

1820.65 --> 1827.3000000000002
they knew it that was gonna be it was

1823.05 --> 1832.86
gonna be a foundation of a watered down

1827.3 --> 1835.74
belief system based on discoveries in

1832.86 --> 1837.9599999999998
science and knowledge of eras where the

1835.74 --> 1840.1200000000001
people in the future would be having no

1837.96 --> 1843.179
grasp of at all because they would all

1840.12 --> 1845.09
be preoccupied by these amazing things

1843.179 --> 1847.23
that they knew were gonna come

1845.09 --> 1849.84
technology you know that if because they

1847.23 --> 1852.6
already saw how many things were popping

1849.84 --> 1854.61
up in the industrialization and of

1852.6 --> 1857.01
course they had probably probably lots

1854.61 --> 1858.7199999999998
of them had knowledge of the antiquity

1857.01 --> 1864.6
so they knew it was only a matter of

1858.72 --> 1867.57
time before yeah people would start to

1864.6 --> 1869.9099999999999
grow up in a luxurious society where

1867.57 --> 1873.24
they would all become retards and just

1869.91 --> 1876.3600000000001
no longer get what sciences they would

1873.24 --> 1880.6200000000001
not be able to think on the level that

1876.36 --> 1884.28
was that was being wielded back then by

1880.62 --> 1888.6299999999999
people so they knew that and that's why

1884.28 --> 1891.78
they created a broken creation a scheme

1888.63 --> 1896.6100000000001
as part of the religion to mind-control

1891.78 --> 1899.8799999999999
a world Society to believe the world is

1896.61 --> 1902.82
a globe and that there's outer space and

1899.88 --> 1906.1200000000001
that it's worthwhile to invest massive

1902.82 --> 1909.78
amounts of money in a guild that would

1906.12 --> 1912.9899999999998
give them space stories and build on

1909.78 --> 1916.22
weaponry to further expand a perfect

1912.99 --> 1916.22
control over the world

1916.7 --> 1920.749
that is what it is

1925.29 --> 1928.369
[Music]

1947.97 --> 1954.8790000000001
anyway I'm gonna enjoy my croissant and

1950.649 --> 1957.6999999999998
you can all sputter in your resistance I

1954.879 --> 1961.1599999999999
don't give a [ __ ] I know I'm totally

1957.7 --> 1964.289
totally on target with this absolutely

1961.16 --> 1964.289
[Music]

1969.26 --> 1978.01
it's the age of illusion that's their

1972.44 --> 1981.53
grand plan the reversed world's age

1978.01 --> 1986.33
where the majority would be believing in

1981.53 --> 1989.87
pure delusion and it's not the first

1986.33 --> 1994.309
time it's systematic empires wield this

1989.87 --> 1997.34
that's why all the Emperor's all the

1994.309 --> 1999.3799999999999
great rulers when there's yeah grand

1997.34 --> 2003.76
pictures of them they're always freakin

1999.38 --> 2006.3400000000001
holding a globe because that is their

2003.76 --> 2010.39
system it is an empire mind control

2006.34 --> 2012.79
system I think all the empires that ever

2010.39 --> 2015.94
went before all tried it one way or the

2012.79 --> 2017.86
other to somehow mythologize and bring

2015.94 --> 2020.98
the people in some kind of religious

2017.86 --> 2023.83
dream so one way or the other to believe

2020.98 --> 2027.4
weird things and then control them with

2023.83 --> 2030.1
those things and this is our mind

2027.4 --> 2032.38
control of the Empire of this era a

2030.1 --> 2036.61
shadowy Empire where the rulers are not

2032.38 --> 2039.94
really the rulers they just wield the

2036.61 --> 2041.6499999999999
puppet politicians and stay try to stay

2039.94 --> 2047.3500000000001
in the shadows as much as possible and

2041.65 --> 2051.04
wield through finance mostly that is our

2047.35 --> 2056.02
era and our religious mind control is

2051.04 --> 2058.409
the heliocentrism and NASA and space

2056.02 --> 2058.409
dreams

2061.949 --> 2067.679
[Music]

2064.98 --> 2069.75
yeah well I'm look I am explaining

2067.679 --> 2071.82
basics all the time and I've been

2069.75 --> 2075.06
answering questions for at least 15

2071.82 --> 2078.589
minutes okay so now I will extrapolate

2075.06 --> 2081.71
upon it where this is all coming from

2078.589 --> 2084.24
the overarching consequences of

2081.71 --> 2087.45
everything that's been happening and if

2084.24 --> 2091.589
you don't like it well that's your

2087.45 --> 2094.74
problem I'm not just gonna stop just a

2091.589 --> 2099.5299999999997
teacher that is available for you to

2094.74 --> 2102.5989999999997
check your your math or whatever okay I

2099.53 --> 2104.849
have a message here I have things

2102.599 --> 2106.4100000000003
specific things that teach people and if

2104.849 --> 2108.27
you don't like that if you just want me

2106.41 --> 2110.7599999999998
to use me like some kind of calculator

2108.27 --> 2114.54
online calculator then you need to go

2110.76 --> 2118.26
away because I do like to answer

2114.54 --> 2122.0299999999997
questions but when I have a message then

2118.26 --> 2124.5600000000004
that is what I'm gonna be doing and

2122.03 --> 2128.9300000000003
complaining about it is only gonna make

2124.56 --> 2132.68
me complain back about the complaining

2128.93 --> 2132.68
you know how that goes

2137.49 --> 2144.72
anyway the humanity class on time mm-hmm

2153.8 --> 2160.63
[Music]

2176.32 --> 2184.27
well that's interesting

2178.69 --> 2186.59
assemblé V technically yes you're right

2184.27 --> 2191.59
scientists it's not scientist by the way

2186.59 --> 2194.69
it's engineers all right and designers

2191.59 --> 2196.61
scientists know unless they're just

2194.69 --> 2199.63
theorists that's not really a scientist

2196.61 --> 2203.8700000000003
that's that could be mean anything

2199.63 --> 2206.9900000000002
anyone can be a theorist whether you be

2203.87 --> 2209.24
very technical or non-technical science

2206.99 --> 2214.1899999999996
is about the actual physical natural

2209.24 --> 2218.87
world so but you may still make a point

2214.19 --> 2220.4900000000002
that you do use gravity because it works

2218.87 --> 2223.4
that's right that's what I've been

2220.49 --> 2226.6699999999996
saying if you have been paying any kind

2223.4 --> 2231.02
of attention but yeah relative density

2226.67 --> 2232.7000000000003
could technically replace gravity it's a

2231.02 --> 2236.12
little bit more complicated to work it

2232.7 --> 2239.8999999999996
out I even requested publicly on my show

2236.12 --> 2245.06
yesterday could a somebody that kind of

2239.9 --> 2250.7200000000003
knows how to program or knows the engine

2245.06 --> 2254.45
of architecture design assist programs

2250.72 --> 2256.1899999999996
especially concerning structural forces

2254.45 --> 2261.0099999999998
and all that testing structural forces

2256.19 --> 2264.02
of designs under conditions could they

2261.01 --> 2266.36
do they understand the program enough to

2264.02 --> 2269.72
basically try to replace the basic

2266.36 --> 2272.92
gravity concept with an actual relative

2269.72 --> 2272.9199999999996
density mechanism

2273.97 --> 2279.0499999999997
yeah with making it really real is that

2276.77 --> 2281.18
possible I I requested it because I

2279.05 --> 2283.52
don't think anybody's done it before but

2281.18 --> 2286.5499999999997
maybe it is impossible because it's just

2283.52 --> 2290.63
too much work but that's just not

2286.55 --> 2293.23
relative to the issue about scientific

2290.63 --> 2296.84
proof because relative density theory is

2293.23 --> 2302.72
proven scientifically in the physical

2296.84 --> 2306.6200000000003
natural world and gravity is not done

2302.72 --> 2308.54
over so it's very nice as a tool and I'm

2306.62 --> 2312.1099999999997
not I'm not saying yeah you can never

2308.54 --> 2314.96
use gravity ever again absolutely knots

2312.11 --> 2319.76
ridiculous if it works it works but it

2314.96 --> 2326.3
has no relevance to the physical and

2319.76 --> 2330.44
natural world and this is not it's not

2326.3 --> 2332.5
applicable in science it's as simple as

2330.44 --> 2332.5
that

2360.35 --> 2366.5299999999997
all right well that's a funny thing they

2364.1 --> 2369.68
could always show you anything gravity

2366.53 --> 2371.96
related of force or they but the thing

2369.68 --> 2375.0499999999997
is they'd always be presupposing it

2371.96 --> 2377.78
they'd always be replacing something

2375.05 --> 2382.67
that is real and then presupposing a

2377.78 --> 2384.6800000000003
gravity force to replace the proven

2382.67 --> 2386.39
thing it's always what they do or they

2384.68 --> 2387.95
just threaten to complete science

2386.39 --> 2390.6099999999997
fiction because you cannot confirm in

2387.95 --> 2393.95
any way and that is how gravity works

2390.61 --> 2397.58
it's a religion it's like it's separate

2393.95 --> 2400.22
meaning it's a technical mini religion

2397.58 --> 2402.41
that you can latch up on it's a ghost

2400.22 --> 2405.62
and that leeches into your mind and says

2402.41 --> 2407.33
like I am real I am so real I'm more

2405.62 --> 2409.49
real to you than anything else out there

2407.33 --> 2411.47
that basically describes that I'm real

2409.49 --> 2414.9199999999996
because I just work too well you can't

2411.47 --> 2419.87
let me go that's what it is that's what

2414.92 --> 2424.27
gravity is mmm feel it burrowing into

2419.87 --> 2424.27
your brain so hard to let go is it

2429.69 --> 2434.13
don't feed the aberration

all right well you know what Orinoco

2784.14 --> 2791.1299999999997
bumble maybe you shouldn't be

2787.92 --> 2794.16
preoccupying yourself with what you

2791.13 --> 2797.1
think other people believe or not

2794.16 --> 2800.1299999999997
believe maybe you should just go with

2797.1 --> 2802.86
what they say and judge them by what

2800.13 --> 2805.29
they do and not preoccupy yourself with

2802.86 --> 2807.78
oh do they really believe this are they

2805.29 --> 2809.75
acting this because then you're sorry to

2807.78 --> 2814.59
say that you're being a [ __ ]

2809.75 --> 2816.3
you're being a conspirator just like

2814.59 --> 2819.03
people that think everyone is a [ __ ]

2816.3 --> 2824.28
and that kind of [ __ ] it's ridiculous

2819.03 --> 2827.7900000000004
you judge people and things by their

2824.28 --> 2830.8500000000004
fruits what they do how they do it what

2827.79 --> 2835.35
their principles turn out to be their

2830.85 --> 2837.69
level of hypocrisy their strength their

2835.35 --> 2840.35
loyalty all these things can be

2837.69 --> 2842.31
determined by all of their actions and

2840.35 --> 2845.85
that's the only thing that's really

2842.31 --> 2848.85
relevant and you shouldn't be

2845.85 --> 2851.1
preoccupied by what you think people

2848.85 --> 2853.68
believe or not believe and when they are

2851.1 --> 2859.35
complete actors because people rarely

2853.68 --> 2868.35
are and when they are you tend to kind

2859.35 --> 2870.99
of know about it most people no matter

2868.35 --> 2876.0499999999997
how ridiculous what they say sounds

you don't have to make exact I'm

3048.33 --> 3056.22
addressing specific people and as I said

3052.74 --> 3059.43
I differentiate between just people that

3056.22 --> 3063.3599999999997
are general ball believers and people

3059.43 --> 3066.99
that are yeah like a cult a religious

3063.36 --> 3069.4500000000003
cults segregates that segregate people

3066.99 --> 3071.52
on their belief and act like total dicks

3069.45 --> 3073.3799999999997
if you don't live in the ball then I

3110.98 --> 3115.23
could always ask questions I've never

3113.26 --> 3118.6000000000004

3115.23 --> 3120.61
don't be a [ __ ] and don't start

3118.6 --> 3123.15
asking me about math and that kind of

3120.61 --> 3126.1
[ __ ] because I don't care

3123.15 --> 3127.9900000000002
I'll give ruff explanations to things

3126.1 --> 3142.8399999999997
but I'm not going to be doing freaking

3227.26 --> 3243.25
be a lot of banding going on here if you

3229.42 --> 3245.67
keep this up how do the seasons work Sam

3243.25 --> 3248.65
Bovie thank you for a normal question

3245.67 --> 3253.21
yeah they work by the intensity of the

3248.65 --> 3255.4900000000002
Sun the angular path of the Sun which

3253.21 --> 3259.95
differentiates throughout the four

3255.49 --> 3263.2
seasons it switches measurably switches

3259.95 --> 3266.5899999999997
it's purely based on Sun activity and

3263.2 --> 3269.2
the interactions of the daylight and the

3266.59 --> 3277.57
moonlight with the earth and that

3269.2 --> 3279.1299999999997
creates the season's over moolah I'm

3277.57 --> 3284.349
gonna take away your wrench if you don't

3279.13 --> 3286.359
hurry the freakin flicking you should be

3284.349 --> 3294.81
removed when he's visibly the first

3286.359 --> 3299.0699999999997
second there okay you're a slow and

3294.81 --> 3303.24
please I don't see why you're deleting

3299.07 --> 3303.2400000000002
x3 twenties messages

3325.63 --> 3330.86
right casual spaceman where do you think

3328.58 --> 3333.17
Aspira Sea theories come from and people

3330.86 --> 3336.23
that believe in them well they come from

3333.17 --> 3339.53
conspiracies and people figure it out

3336.23 --> 3342.5
that's where they come from the only

3339.53 --> 3345.26
problem is is that yeah even though

3342.5 --> 3349.91
they're blatantly obviously conspiracies

3345.26 --> 3353.1200000000003
going on with loads and loads of proof

3349.91 --> 3355.45
so much proof it would just nauseate

3353.12 --> 3358.85
anyone that tries to deny it

3355.45 --> 3360.98
seriously loads have proved the problem

3358.85 --> 3363.86
is though that there's still a lot of

3360.98 --> 3365.81
unknown factors because conspirers keep

3363.86 --> 3369.59
secrets you don't know exactly

3365.81 --> 3372.04
everything they're doing so that's where

3369.59 --> 3375.08
conspiracy theories come from from

3372.04 --> 3379.91
conspiracies that actually do happen a

3375.08 --> 3392.39
lot of them with physical registered

3379.91 --> 3394.8199999999997
proof of them so that's [ __ ]

3392.39 --> 3401.15
conspiracies can be proven and people

3394.82 --> 3404.65
have been trialed right for conspiracy

3401.15 --> 3407.42
it is a actually thing you can be

3404.65 --> 3411.6800000000003
prosecuted for so that is absolute

3407.42 --> 3414.19
horseshit conspiracies can definitely be

3411.68 --> 3414.19
proven

3419.75 --> 3427.49
and history The Conspirator are

3423.849 --> 3429.8
conspiracies in history that there is no

3427.49 --> 3432.6699999999996
that's a false equivalence you can't

3429.8 --> 3436.4900000000002
compare conspiracy with history

3432.67 --> 3441.849
conspiracy is an act history is a period

3436.49 --> 3441.8489999999997
is the past it's not in the same level

3456.39 --> 3459.14
all right

3463.309 --> 3476.7200000000003
you know what I think I have a solution

3467.339 --> 3476.72
to this mm yeah I know what to do

3479.36 --> 3487.96
I'm just gonna ban their worth

3483.14 --> 3487.96
trigonometry how about that

3491.93 --> 3496.43
hmm let's see where do I go

3498.25 --> 3503.02
it's much easier that way I just don't

3500.56 --> 3505.93
want to talk about I'll talk about it

3503.02 --> 3510.09
very roughly people are gonna spam that

3505.93 --> 3518.23
I'm just gonna make that impossible oh

3510.09 --> 3521.01
yeah that's fine look you can try to

3518.23 --> 3523.66
like make memes and ask keep paintings

3521.01 --> 3526.75
paintings with it that's all just fine

3523.66 --> 3528.94
and dandy if you want to especially spam

3526.75 --> 3531.49
about it that's just that's just fine

3528.94 --> 3534.79
and dandy I don't give a [ __ ] really but

3531.49 --> 3538.3799999999997
in general to just assure that people

3534.79 --> 3543.39
are not gonna be talking about it I

3538.38 --> 3543.3900000000003
think I'm just gonna ban the word

3552.0 --> 3562.84
[Music]

3553.97 --> 3565.73
all right because it is only only ever

3562.84 --> 3568.46
ballers that break out that freaking

3565.73 --> 3571.58
word they're stupid [ __ ]

3568.46 --> 3574.849
presuppositional math addiction so

3571.58 --> 3584.17
goodbye I'm just gonna delete those

3574.849 --> 3584.17
retardation words so no one trigonometry

3588.53 --> 3593.9300000000003
[Music]

3590.8 --> 3596.3300000000004
that's right trigonometry for me falls

3593.93 --> 3598.72
in the same level as the N word that's

3596.33 --> 3598.72
right

3610.02 --> 3622.059
nice that's a very good one and it does

3616.99 --> 3624.6899999999996
studio crystal math that is that is so

3622.059 --> 3624.69
on target

3656.73 --> 3663.309
cassius paceman stop stop

3660.039 --> 3667.119

3663.309 --> 3672.039
when you know you can there's a Skype

3667.119 --> 3676.509
link right in the description box in

3672.039 --> 3680.1090000000004
YouTube or win7 you contact me on skype

3676.509 --> 3682.569
I add you you can talk to me you can ask

3680.109 --> 3690.16
me hours and hours and hours and hours

3682.569 --> 3700.749
of questions right you don't have to ask

3690.16 --> 3703.18
me in chat I'm not trying to attack you

3700.749 --> 3705.22
I'm attacking the specific annoying type

3703.18 --> 3707.6499999999996
of individuals you are obviously not

3705.22 --> 3712.749
them I don't know if you are some kind

3707.65 --> 3716.829
of guy pretending now to be a CNN

3712.749 --> 3718.72
undercover guy it's like oh look oh

3716.829 --> 3721.0890000000004
really just mentioned this so now we're

3718.72 --> 3722.7389999999996
gonna just act that that's really funny

3721.089 --> 3724.749
that you just popped up right there and

3722.739 --> 3726.13
then that's fine maybe you were

3724.749 --> 3728.5589999999997
everything you wanted these guys I don't

3726.13 --> 3731.92
give a [ __ ] because I just act exactly

3728.559 --> 3734.92
how act and I don't give a flying [ __ ]

3731.92 --> 3737.829
if people are going to be acting for

3734.92 --> 3739.9300000000003
whatever reason I just go with the

3737.829 --> 3744.6090000000004
information and I go with the structure

3739.93 --> 3745.8089999999997
that is only thing I care about and if

3744.609 --> 3748.66
people are just gonna be straightforward

3745.809 --> 3751.029
dicks through their lingo through their

3748.66 --> 3757.299
suggestions through their residents

3751.029 --> 3759.279
energy then I will be repelling them but

3757.299 --> 3762.549
you don't have to be like overly

3759.279 --> 3766.509
apologetic please don't that's just

3762.549 --> 3771.42
annoying if you have no reason for

3766.509 --> 3775.38
concern because you are not a troll then

3771.42 --> 3775.38
you have nothing to worry about

3776.05 --> 3790.38
ah nice finally in time well done thank

3787.66 --> 3790.3799999999997
you Oh Braco

3815.78 --> 3818.9190000000003
[Music]

3834.19 --> 3839.9
okay that's interesting yeah right yeah

3838.46 --> 3843.23
how can there be a summer and a winter

3839.9 --> 3847.4500000000003
at the same time all right

3843.23 --> 3855.02
well because the Sun just seems to be

3847.45 --> 3857.54
more intense on one side then on the

3855.02 --> 3859.43
other and that's perfectly explainable

3857.54 --> 3863.02
if you conceptualize the Sun to be just

3859.43 --> 3865.2799999999997
purely holographic so it all depends on

3863.02 --> 3869.6
whatever it's going to be doing in

3865.28 --> 3873.11
relation to the to the observers in the

3869.6 --> 3875.7799999999997
location Azure and with that with the

3873.11 --> 3881.6800000000003
locations come the interval of these sun

3875.78 --> 3881.6800000000003
intensities so that's just how it works

3886.46 --> 3894.92
right over moco that doesn't work

3888.89 --> 3900.17
because you can't ban names you can't

3894.92 --> 3903.41
just you can't filter yeah account names

3900.17 --> 3912.92
that doesn't work that would be very

3903.41 --> 3914.8089999999997
easy though but if I'd yeah even if I

3912.92 --> 3917.059
did then that would be freaky because

3914.809 --> 3919.7000000000003
nobody could ever mention the word Lahti

3917.059 --> 3924.17
again that seems like a little bit

3919.7 --> 3927.23
excessive let's not go for a full

3924.17 --> 3929.41
Stalinist censorship yet video what I

3927.23 --> 3929.41
mean

3945.1 --> 3951.2799999999997
well Sam Bovie yeah the Sun has

3948.52 --> 3955.81
different intensities but it's not

3951.28 --> 3959.53
pointing right it's it's not an object

3955.81 --> 3963.7599999999998
in a location it's the daylight

3959.53 --> 3967.9500000000003
direction which the epicenter of which

3963.76 --> 3967.9500000000003
you see a apparent Sun disc

3968.55 --> 3973.57
there's no confirmable measure distance

3971.41 --> 3976.87
to the Sun there because it's very

3973.57 --> 3979.32
likely just purely up optics it's a

3976.87 --> 3983.41
holographic based it's the only light

3979.32 --> 3989.26
there's no provable object up there that

3983.41 --> 3991.39
is a Sun but there is a variation in

3989.26 --> 3993.4900000000002
oscillation you could say in the day

3991.39 --> 3997.24
light intensity there's just all these

3993.49 --> 4001.4599999999996
oscillations in the in the globe of the

3997.24 --> 4005.1899999999996
heavens in all the celestial lights

4001.46 --> 4007.77
there's oscillation everywhere the

4005.19 --> 4011.18
intensities and just the pathways and

4007.77 --> 4014.27
yeah that's how it works

4011.18 --> 4014.27
[Music]

4018.1 --> 4021.83
[Music]

4032.03 --> 4037.7900000000004
yeah saucy London yeah indeed I already

4035.42 --> 4041.1800000000003
explained yesterday so Holograms can

4037.79 --> 4042.62
give you sunburns that's right if

4041.18 --> 4045.14
they're intense enough if the light

4042.62 --> 4047.06
source actually causing that are intense

4045.14 --> 4049.7599999999998
enough they could give you sunburn if

4047.06 --> 4055.36
it's an actual 3d light laser based

4049.76 --> 4055.36
hologram system if it's just a a

4055.81 --> 4063.71
hologram picture that's not gonna

4058.48 --> 4066.56
sunburn you any light based system pure

4063.71 --> 4068.96
light it can burn you whatever may have

4066.56 --> 4072.71
created it light burns you there is

4068.96 --> 4076.55
light hitting your skin there is

4072.71 --> 4081.83
chemical change there is heat buildup

4076.55 --> 4084.92
all that their light has interaction but

4081.83 --> 4087.86
to assume that it is a lamp up there is

4084.92 --> 4091.07
just based on presuppositional thinking

4087.86 --> 4094.51
and physicality assumption bias you have

4091.07 --> 4094.51
no confirmation of any of it

4109.819 --> 4116.009
all right so I'm think I'm gonna round

4112.589 --> 4117.6
out the show I've been going oh yeah we

4116.009 --> 4122.63
over at howard and debates have already

4117.6 --> 4122.63
started up so thanks everyone for coming

4124.1 --> 4131.88
over all good hang out even though

4126.83 --> 4133.7699999999995
annoying trolls and very yeah it's just

4131.88 --> 4136.02
neat to weed out the trolls or it's just

4133.77 --> 4139.31
gonna be the freakin trolls in chat and

4136.02 --> 4141.839000000001
everybody else is just not feeling good

4139.31 --> 4143.7300000000005
enough to talk or anything or it just

4141.839 --> 4145.98
barely seen because the trolls just keep

4143.73 --> 4149.759
on spamming their crap and trying to

4145.98 --> 4152.2789999999995
poke me so I need to whack whack the

4149.759 --> 4158.04
trolls every now and then sorry about

4152.279 --> 4162.450000000001
that but yeah thanks everyone for coming

4158.04 --> 4166.41

bird number 179 oh yeah by the way don't

4180.39 --> 4187.02
please don't forget to contribute some

4205.17 --> 4211.62
tomorrow Flat Earth early work 179 and

4209.239 --> 4213.239
I'm gonna be on the Flat Earth debates

4211.62 --> 4219.89
if there's still room on the panel and

4213.239 --> 4251.1089999999995
until the next show keep it flat

4219.89 --> 4251.109
