but what about them Nathan what

155.58 --> 159.8

pop by

171.18 --> 177.14000000000001
on those things

174.54 --> 177.14
or anything

177.3 --> 180.14000000000001
a killer

181.379 --> 184.85999999999999
that you actually think is noteworthy

183.36 --> 187.58
are you just trying to be attention

184.86 --> 187.58
grabby

188.519 --> 192.739
I don't know what did what did she do

198.42 --> 202.14
hey God

199.86 --> 205.519
yes I will Nathan

202.14 --> 205.51899999999998
made me curious now

215.04 --> 218.42
nah it says

229.319 --> 231.92
huh

233.22 --> 241.519
oh I even got the Dutch news on that

237.72 --> 241.519
but that's from like a week ago

266.82 --> 272.24
okay

268.919 --> 272.24
uh that sounds like

272.61 --> 275.699
[Music]

277.919 --> 280.4
right

305.96 --> 312.23999999999995
oh right sorry that's about like

309.419 --> 315.18
basically about

312.24 --> 317.52
the contract system

315.18 --> 320.46
pretty much right that's what I'm

317.52 --> 323.12
getting from it right now

320.46 --> 323.12
huh

328.139 --> 334.02
all right okay

331.5 --> 338.0
oh yeah

334.02 --> 338.0
I hope I hope it works out

341.639 --> 344.36
for her

352.8 --> 356.94
huh

353.88 --> 358.319
right I I don't know if it's really a

356.94 --> 362.3
Worthy

358.319 --> 362.3
subject for my show though

365.4 --> 370.08
but I guess that a lot of people are

367.62 --> 372.36
interested in this sort of thing like

370.08 --> 376.44
Hollywood

372.36 --> 377.88
ah slavery in a way where they're born

376.44 --> 381.6
into it

377.88 --> 383.699
and with being born into it like they

381.6 --> 385.08000000000004
get moved very young into like a

383.699 --> 387.84000000000003
contract setup

385.08 --> 390.5
that most of them probably regret later

387.84 --> 390.5
on in life

400.86 --> 405.3
right

402.419 --> 408.78
alrighty

405.3 --> 412.22
yeah it's dude like the system has

408.78 --> 412.21999999999997
treated her very harshly

412.8 --> 417.24
so yeah

414.96 --> 419.65999999999997
the best tour you know I hope she gets

417.24 --> 419.66
out of it

426.479 --> 430.38
hello Michael come

428.22 --> 432.90000000000003
oh wait you already said

430.38 --> 436.21999999999997
seeking star water good to see you

432.9 --> 436.21999999999997
Dutch sailor hello

463.74 --> 469.199
all right

466.259 --> 472.5
I've been also hearing some

469.199 --> 474.72
disturbing new news in several countries

472.5 --> 477.06
in Europe apparently

474.72 --> 480.47900000000004
governments are now mandating the

477.06 --> 481.74
freaking Corona facts to their medical

480.479 --> 483.18
people that are in the medical

481.74 --> 485.40000000000003
profession

483.18 --> 487.5
like

485.4 --> 491.4
where before they were already pushing

487.5 --> 492.24
that [ __ ] no corporate policy blah blah

491.4 --> 495.35999999999996
blah

492.24 --> 497.819
now governments

495.36 --> 500.639
and

497.819 --> 502.68
remember are now mandating that that's

500.639 --> 505.099
like oh

502.68 --> 508.5
that's definitely a Nuremberg violation

505.099 --> 512.159
very disturbing

508.5 --> 514.5
I now bet that they'll get into big

512.159 --> 516.12
trouble for

514.5 --> 519.419
a lot of people

516.12 --> 522.36
do not appreciate that

519.419 --> 524.3389999999999
right and in Germany it seems to be that

522.36 --> 526.94
there's some counter push

524.339 --> 526.94
yes

527.1 --> 529.519
good

531.36 --> 536.16
uh Dutch sailor don't worry about it

534.36 --> 539.6
right by the way I remember your name

536.16 --> 539.6
now it's gunny velas right

539.76 --> 546.66
right don't worry about it

543.24 --> 550.2
if you needed to go Anonymous on another

546.66 --> 552.98
account to basically recompose yourself

550.2 --> 552.98
that's fine

562.2 --> 566.279
right but you don't have to worry no

564.36 --> 568.32
more [ __ ] because that sort of

566.279 --> 571.019
[ __ ] I don't mind

568.32 --> 575.1
right it's all about the behavior

571.019 --> 579.2
whether you are overt or anonymous

575.1 --> 579.2
so don't worry about it

582.36 --> 587.66
huh right yes I heard about that seeking

585.18 --> 587.66
Star Wars

588.779 --> 592.279
oh yeah look

593.82 --> 597.2600000000001
it was in the 50s

599.459 --> 603.4799999999999
yeah yeah that's kind of like common

601.86 --> 606.38
conspiracy

603.48 --> 606.38
bye now

610.5 --> 615.019
by the way I watched that movie

612.66 --> 615.019
yesterday

615.66 --> 621.779
that was ended to me

619.44 --> 625.44
recommended it to me but it was really

621.779 --> 627.36
good the tomorrow wore very

625.44 --> 630.72
very recent movie

627.36 --> 633.0
I was very very impressed by it and a

630.72 --> 636.6
little shocked here and there

633.0 --> 641.459
was chock full of programming

636.6 --> 644.7
but they didn't like sjw you flare it up

641.459 --> 647.04
out of control so it was kind of like

644.7 --> 649.88
more subtle

647.04 --> 649.88
I like that

650.459 --> 658.079
but yeah heavy very heavy movie

654.3 --> 660.4799999999999
and the ending was like very

658.079 --> 662.64
rewarding

660.48 --> 666.26
which is really not what you typically

662.64 --> 666.26
expect from a movie like this

668.459 --> 676.079
overall great great movie and

672.54 --> 679.079
like the correlations with the alien

676.079 --> 681.54
franchise sorry if I spoil something

679.079 --> 682.92
nah probably not you'll recognize it

681.54 --> 685.019
very early on

682.92 --> 687.36
is like

685.019 --> 688.68
they definitely had their own design of

687.36 --> 691.26
it

688.68 --> 694.079
the movie's very clear that

691.26 --> 696.48
some something monsters

694.079 --> 700.62
their design was

696.48 --> 702.3000000000001
very unique and terrifying I dare I say

700.62 --> 704.82
I thought those creatures were actually

702.3 --> 707.0
more terrifying than alien

704.82 --> 710.399
foreign

707.0 --> 712.26
s have another style they're more silent

710.399 --> 714.18
and shadowy

712.26 --> 715.56
strike from the Shadows type of

714.18 --> 718.5
creatures

715.56 --> 722.5189999999999
these were just much more overt just

718.5 --> 725.16
like unkillable nasty nasty little

722.519 --> 727.26
big demon creatures

725.16 --> 730.079
they're like the first time you see that

727.26 --> 732.18
it's like real like

730.079 --> 734.16
first time the way they showed that it

732.18 --> 738.8389999999999
was like the perfect way to reveal it

734.16 --> 741.6
like I literally like what oh my God

738.839 --> 742.8000000000001
like that's much more terrifying than I

741.6 --> 746.399
even thought

742.8 --> 748.079
and they built up really well to it like

746.399 --> 750.72
I was

748.079 --> 753.9799999999999
very very impressed by the entire movie

750.72 --> 753.98
everything about it

756.66 --> 762.12
were even some kind of some funny

759.12 --> 765.72
elements in it too which is like just a

762.12 --> 768.139
extra bonus on top of it

765.72 --> 768.139
right

768.36 --> 774.839
but yeah the similarities to

771.899 --> 779.06
inch franchise gave me the feeling like

774.839 --> 779.0600000000001
yeah this movie is

781.5 --> 784.04
right

784.74 --> 792.0790000000001
I haven't seen a movie that compelling

788.04 --> 792.079
and fascinating and

792.48 --> 797.82
high tension in in like in a very

794.82 --> 800.1600000000001
exciting way since aliens right and

797.82 --> 803.36
that's been kind of my all-time favorite

800.16 --> 803.36
science fiction movie

803.399 --> 809.7
and though yeah it cannot really surpass

805.86 --> 812.22
that because of oh pause

809.7 --> 814.5600000000001
it's definitely kind of on the same

812.22 --> 818.3000000000001
level very very impressive very

814.56 --> 818.3
difficult to pull in this age

820.8 --> 825.019
yeah white spikes they call them that's

822.839 --> 825.019
right

831.66 --> 836.8199999999999
super deep at Siberian borehole okay

835.44 --> 839.9590000000001
to come

836.82 --> 844.5
low clearly by the way

839.959 --> 847.8
Jesus yeah but species that's no not

844.5 --> 850.76
really but that's it's totally different

847.8 --> 854.8199999999999
species is much more

850.76 --> 857.959
hallucinatory scary demon [ __ ]

854.82 --> 857.9590000000001
right just like

871.16 --> 876.18
uh very famous movie there was a remake

874.5 --> 878.459
of it it kind of sucked

876.18 --> 880.8599999999999
uh

878.459 --> 883.1389999999999
where they go what is it uh

880.86 --> 886.019
Antarctica or something and there's this

883.139 --> 889.5790000000001
weird freaky super

886.019 --> 889.579
morphing creature

890.399 --> 897.3
that movie was also very very

894.18 --> 901.199
species is a different

897.3 --> 903.06
versus Predator thing yeah thing that

901.199 --> 904.9799999999999
that's right that's the one

903.06 --> 908.8199999999999
this is alien versus pred that's much

904.98 --> 912.98
more of a Sci-Fi Action right but that's

908.82 --> 912.98
different like this is

914.459 --> 919.8199999999999
in a way almost more in the format of

922.8 --> 927.779
and why are these names eluding me uh

932.82 --> 942.0790000000001
Starship Trooper like this movie is much

936.959 --> 942.079
more like it's really a military move

945.18 --> 951.959
but yeah Starship Troopers was much more

948.24 --> 955.44
like poor on the Fascism and all that

951.959 --> 958.6199999999999
weird knocks Nazi glorification style

955.44 --> 961.44
but then mixing it up it's very that's a

958.62 --> 963.66
very odd movie this wasn't like that but

961.44 --> 968.3000000000001
it almost had the same feel it was so

963.66 --> 968.3
much action and just War heroics

972.66 --> 977.459
but at the same time yeah aliens and by

975.12 --> 979.86
the way that was in Starship well so it

977.459 --> 981.3
kind of reminded me of that as well and

979.86 --> 984.66
hey in a way

981.3 --> 986.7589999999999
aliens but had a little bit of that too

984.66 --> 987.959
although it was much more smaller Strike

986.759 --> 990.48
Team

987.959 --> 992.7589999999999
much more gorilla bore

990.48 --> 995.12
set up like that

992.759 --> 995.12
anyway

998.519 --> 1005.18
but yeah thing

1001.279 --> 1008.779
is that's just a horror move like that's

1005.18 --> 1011.18
just pure Insanity fear error

1008.779 --> 1014.06
and species kind of was like that too

1011.18 --> 1015.8
that is not that's not like an alien

1014.06 --> 1018.5189999999999
move

1015.8 --> 1018.519
very different

1031.52 --> 1035.48
I've heard it or maybe I have seen it

1033.86 --> 1036.74
but forgot about it

1035.48 --> 1040.539
okay

1036.74 --> 1040.539
hey clutch bear

1052.039 --> 1058.64
right but yeah that movie is still

1055.039 --> 1060.74
echoing back on my mind a little

1058.64 --> 1062.7800000000002
very glad that it had such a

1060.74 --> 1067.1200000000001
satisfactory ending

1062.78 --> 1067.12
because it was a pretty

1067.34 --> 1074.24
harsh movie anyways

1070.88 --> 1078.679
I like that it was really more like

1074.24 --> 1080.72
style about war and War heroics

1078.679 --> 1083.8400000000001
then it was

1080.72 --> 1087.28
like a horror survival where

1083.84 --> 1087.28
up on Etc

1088.82 --> 1094.34
and yeah the end was just like wow and

1092.24 --> 1098.179
believe it's over

1094.34 --> 1099.9189999999999
it's just very interesting

1098.179 --> 1102.919
fresh

1099.919 --> 1102.919
anyway

1112.46 --> 1116.179
right but yeah Dutch sailor if you

1114.44 --> 1117.74
haven't seen this movie before it's

1116.179 --> 1120.5590000000002
really nothing like aliens versus

1117.74 --> 1123.26
predator or species

1120.559 --> 1127.52
like you'll feel it like it's

1123.26 --> 1130.64
this one is just way better as a movie

1127.52 --> 1133.76
like how the movie was set up how things

1130.64 --> 1135.6200000000001
happen how the actors are it's much much

1133.76 --> 1136.94
better than both of these

1135.62 --> 1141.039
to mention

1136.94 --> 1141.039
it's a whole different world

1145.88 --> 1151.94
oh god really ah I thought you were

1148.94 --> 1157.6000000000001
gonna do that Nathan

1151.94 --> 1157.6000000000001
yeah God talk about it Abby

1160.12 --> 1167.84
yeah I checked Skype Nathan that's

1163.34 --> 1170.24
hilarious man thank you it's it's silly

1167.84 --> 1172.1599999999999
it's silly that this is happening but I

1170.24 --> 1175.46
actually kind of like it

1172.16 --> 1178.52
like I've always avoided being attention

1175.46 --> 1181.28
grabby like neurotically

1178.52 --> 1185.02
but now that somebody else is doing it

1181.28 --> 1185.02
for me I kind of like it

1186.02 --> 1192.16
uh

1188.14 --> 1192.16
total clickbait yeah I know

1192.44 --> 1197.1200000000001
that's hilarious it's like oh Britney

1195.08 --> 1199.96
people click on it and then we're

1197.12 --> 1199.9599999999998
talking about it

1200.419 --> 1205.6000000000001
science fiction

1202.82 --> 1205.6
action movies

1205.72 --> 1212.6200000000001
not so much about Britney but hey yeah

1208.82 --> 1212.62
free free Britney sure

1212.84 --> 1216.52
like she's been through enough

1219.38 --> 1224.38
you're going to add it yeah yeah

1221.84 --> 1224.3799999999999
I will

1229.4 --> 1232.9
I'll try to do it right now

1263.12 --> 1267.3799999999999
oh God next time when you upload a

1266.0 --> 1270.38
picture please don't call it

1267.38 --> 1270.38
f7485044-seize

1274.1 --> 1279.74
because that's really hard to find back

1276.5 --> 1282.46
in lists

1279.74 --> 1282.46
uh

1284.419 --> 1286.96
thing

1302.43 --> 1305.559
[Applause]

1308.9 --> 1311.44
okay

1343.1 --> 1346.12
there you go

1350.179 --> 1354.8200000000002
right thanks for that sorry for taking

1352.34 --> 1354.82
so long

1357.25 --> 1360.339
[Music]

1365.72 --> 1375.76
yes my kataman I did say that yes

1370.58 --> 1375.76
it's yes Angel spoons cause the tides

1375.86 --> 1378.28
right

1381.679 --> 1385.179
our win trademark

1385.4 --> 1390.4
a Donato BR welcome to the chat

1395.24 --> 1401.179
what now look this is just a question no

1398.9 --> 1403.1000000000001
somebody heard it like Angel spoons what

1401.179 --> 1406.52
is that did you say that

1403.1 --> 1409.24
that doesn't have to be a troll

1406.52 --> 1409.24
could be

1413.0 --> 1417.44
it's as good as the Moon

1415.0 --> 1419.179
uh no

1417.44 --> 1421.279
no the Moon

1419.179 --> 1423.919
supposedly causing the tides is

1421.279 --> 1427.84
completely ridiculous I think Angel

1423.919 --> 1427.8400000000001
spoons are much more viable

1428.72 --> 1432.799
and memorable

1430.64 --> 1436.4
because it is weird

1432.799 --> 1439.58
it is obvious not literal

1436.4 --> 1441.5590000000002
right so it forces you to kind of

1439.58 --> 1444.4399999999998
visualize what that's supposed to mean

1441.559 --> 1446.0
and then you look at the actual tide

1444.44 --> 1448.64
match

1446.0 --> 1452.419
right and then you say like okay Angel

1448.64 --> 1454.4
spoons what am I seeing yeah it is kind

1452.419 --> 1456.6200000000001
of like an angel spoon isn't it just

1454.4 --> 1459.3200000000002
it's like a spoon stirring in the water

1456.62 --> 1461.36
locally like in a teacup

1459.32 --> 1464.74
yeah that's exactly what I did that's

1461.36 --> 1464.74
why I called it Angel spoons

1466.539 --> 1470.24
are all these spoons while these spoons

1468.919 --> 1472.88
are magnetic

1470.24 --> 1474.74
they're not actually physical

1472.88 --> 1478.46
right that makes them

1474.74 --> 1480.799
as a theory more viable than dark matter

1478.46 --> 1484.279
because there's actually something that

1480.799 --> 1486.3799999999999
has a measurable influence right from

1484.279 --> 1488.84
something that is otherwise undetectable

1486.38 --> 1490.4
so that makes it more viable than the

1488.84 --> 1494.72
concept of dark matter which is

1490.4 --> 1494.72
completely undetectable unmeasurable

1495.5 --> 1500.72
so yeah I think Angel spoons is

1497.72 --> 1503.559
definitely a much more viable concept

1500.72 --> 1503.559
than dark matter

1504.5 --> 1509.24
can anybody see the new thumbnail might

1507.02 --> 1512.6
take a while Nathan

1509.24 --> 1515.6
I guess if you check out my main page

1512.6 --> 1515.6
eventually

1516.2 --> 1522.46
yeah the thumbnails should be switching

1518.96 --> 1522.46
but that sometimes takes a while

1523.7 --> 1526.779
it's not there yet

1532.34 --> 1535.299
all right all right

1537.14 --> 1542.1200000000001
anyway so yeah where are all these

1540.26 --> 1544.039
spoons well just look at the tide Maps

1542.12 --> 1546.6789999999999
every every place

1544.039 --> 1548.179
there's there's a circular tide thing

1546.679 --> 1550.46
going on

1548.179 --> 1552.98
that's where there's an angel

1550.46 --> 1556.539
it's a it's not one spoon

1552.98 --> 1556.539
there's a lot of spoons

1557.48 --> 1561.6200000000001
I haven't actually counted them maybe

1559.88 --> 1564.64
maybe I should maybe I should try to

1561.62 --> 1564.6399999999999
find the tide map

1572.779 --> 1578.059
I looked up tight on Wiki and it gave me

1575.419 --> 1581.6000000000001
this stupid Moon model that's just so

1578.059 --> 1583.3999999999999
stupid like hey you look up tight maybe

1581.6 --> 1585.32
you actually want to see the tide map

1583.4 --> 1589.5800000000002
and not some stupid

1585.32 --> 1595.12
model picture of a globe with oceans

1589.58 --> 1595.12
acting absolutely idiotic not as in real

1613.34 --> 1618.1399999999999
yeah now I don't want to look up a place

1615.62 --> 1622.1589999999999
called Tides thanks

1618.14 --> 1626.3200000000002
uh ah there you go there it is

1622.159 --> 1626.3200000000002
I hope to get an interactive one

1636.559 --> 1643.399
Nathan do you happen to have like a

1640.159 --> 1645.3200000000002
animated height map

1643.399 --> 1648.34
somewhere stored that you could

1645.32 --> 1648.34
potentially share

1649.22 --> 1652.0
through Skype

1665.659 --> 1671.5390000000002
because I got it well

1667.94 --> 1674.26
a non-animated map but

1671.539 --> 1674.26
uh

1680.679 --> 1684.22
Goku earthro

1688.279 --> 1691.539
yeah I don't have that

1723.919 --> 1730.419
all right this thing

1727.039 --> 1730.419
so yeah

1731.6 --> 1739.1
where it's red and yellow like because

1734.72 --> 1741.919
it's a spectrum this thing right so

1739.1 --> 1743.899
the darkest blue spots are like the most

1741.919 --> 1747.0800000000002
away from the spoons

1743.899 --> 1750.1589999999999
pink I think that's what this map is

1747.08 --> 1753.9189999999999
so yeah there's a lot of spoons

1750.159 --> 1755.3600000000001
one two three just a whole lot and

1753.919 --> 1757.159
there's bigger spoons and there's

1755.36 --> 1760.4189999999999
smaller spoons

1757.159 --> 1760.419
it's all over the place

1761.72 --> 1766.34
right but uh yeah just

1764.179 --> 1769.3990000000001
just to remind you what you're looking

1766.34 --> 1771.62
at yeah that's not a giant bulge of

1769.399 --> 1777.1
water

1771.62 --> 1777.1
moving at the equator now is it huh huh

1782.24 --> 1784.72
right

1796.82 --> 1802.72
hey that flat fellow thanks for the 99

1799.34 --> 1802.72
cent Super Chat donation

1815.24 --> 1817.96

1818.659 --> 1823.48
ah yeah yeah yeah your thumbnails uh

1823.88 --> 1829.0990000000002

1826.06 --> 1829.099
[Music]

1832.159 --> 1841.0
that's a thermo

1835.36 --> 1841.0
thermal align circulation what

1861.2 --> 1865.96
if you keep it up yeah sure I'm keeping

1863.48 --> 1865.96
it in there

1867.2 --> 1871.94
it seems to be working

1869.38 --> 1874.88
yesterday's show was already past like

1871.94 --> 1877.3400000000001
the normal typical view count

1874.88 --> 1880.3990000000001
so yeah it does work

1877.34 --> 1884.6
I don't know who else is watching

1880.399 --> 1887.26
but things views are being counted

1884.6 --> 1887.26
I guess

1898.1 --> 1902.1789999999999
that's why I done a video on this right

1899.96 --> 1903.6200000000001

advertising for Elon

actual troll

2082.72 --> 2085.02
what

2085.119 --> 2090.119
you're one of those guys that just won't

2087.04 --> 2090.119
leave Britney Alone

2103.78 --> 2110.02
oh well remix

2106.2 --> 2113.64
n007 I'm I'm glad you know what century

2110.02 --> 2113.64
you live in that's great

2115.72 --> 2118.72
congratulations

2129.94 --> 2135.2200000000003
no she's not in prison not

2132.64 --> 2137.92
literally

2135.22 --> 2140.0989999999997
just contract [ __ ] what is it called

2137.92 --> 2140.099
again

2144.04 --> 2150.94
her dad declared her insane and like

2148.78 --> 2153.28
he's not being reasonable about it

2150.94 --> 2154.839
everybody's trying to kind of control

2153.28 --> 2158.32
her and

2154.839 --> 2160.42
her income all that and she just wants

2158.32 --> 2162.82
out of that right

2160.42 --> 2164.92
so in that sense she has been in prison

2162.82 --> 2167.1400000000003
it's just not yeah conservative

2164.92 --> 2170.079
servatorship

2167.14 --> 2172.7799999999997
and she wants out of that

2170.079 --> 2176.2000000000003
and Elon supported that right and

2172.78 --> 2178.3590000000004
however Goofy and stupid that guy may be

2176.2 --> 2181.24
and however much a traveler with his

2178.359 --> 2184.3199999999997
space [ __ ]

2181.24 --> 2184.3199999999997
wasting of money

2184.9 --> 2189.82
I think

2187.359 --> 2192.04
when you do something good you should be

2189.82 --> 2194.76
commended for that doesn't really matter

2192.04 --> 2194.7599999999998
who you are

2203.14 --> 2209.0789999999997
right so yeah there you go

2206.17 --> 2211.98
[Music]

2209.079 --> 2211.98
foreign

2249.46 --> 2255.9
so that's it I guess

2253.02 --> 2259.46
no other comments

2255.9 --> 2262.4990000000003
you just literally fell for clickbait

2259.46 --> 2262.4990000000003
[Music]

2262.599 --> 2267.04
that's it

2263.92 --> 2269.26
what do you think I I just had a random

2267.04 --> 2273.24
picture like that in there and that I

2269.26 --> 2273.2400000000002
couldn't even say anything about it

2273.46 --> 2276.88
oh if I'm gonna have clickbait about

2275.2 --> 2279.52
something then

2276.88 --> 2282.52
it'll have to be something that I can at

2279.52 --> 2284.94
least talk about otherwise I feel very

2282.52 --> 2284.94
silly

2289.96 --> 2293.039
[Music]

2294.7 --> 2296.8799999999997
foreign

2298.14 --> 2303.359
early bird show Jason Brown but yeah

2301.06 --> 2303.359
welcome

2312.46 --> 2318.0
oh hey Neil

2315.52 --> 2318.0
hmm

2327.24 --> 2330.39
[Music]

2334.06 --> 2338.38
right so yeah talk about whatever you

2336.339 --> 2339.52
want man

2338.38 --> 2342.28
like

2339.52 --> 2344.079
you know there's a lot of people out

2342.28 --> 2346.8590000000004
there that

2344.079 --> 2350.92
that have taken my

2346.859 --> 2353.38
fractal roll bait for a long long time

2350.92 --> 2355.7200000000003
and I noticed that yeah

2353.38 --> 2358.3
everything I sewed I sewed for a reason

2355.72 --> 2360.52
even if I didn't have a full

2358.3 --> 2361.8390000000004
complete picture comprehension of what I

2360.52 --> 2364.96
was doing

2361.839 --> 2366.88
but people constantly now try to troll

2364.96 --> 2369.76
bring it up and every time they do it

2366.88 --> 2372.04
they literally hand me an excuse to

2369.76 --> 2375.94
start talking about something

2372.04 --> 2379.06
that I thought up again so they're like

2375.94 --> 2380.26
my external memory in a way isn't that

2379.06 --> 2383.98
funny

2380.26 --> 2386.46
that controls they don't even realize it

2383.98 --> 2389.44
that they are functioning as my own

2386.46 --> 2391.78
external memory isn't that just

2389.44 --> 2395.56
hilarious right so even trolls

2391.78 --> 2397.9
unwittingly can have a function

2395.56 --> 2399.7
that is that could be considered

2397.9 --> 2402.28
positive

2399.7 --> 2404.68
every time somebody comes oh you're

2402.28 --> 2408.0
you're crazy because of meteors if you

2404.68 --> 2408.0
don't know what meteors is or

2408.04 --> 2412.9
oh

2410.44 --> 2414.099
Angel spoons what is that that's so

2412.9 --> 2416.859
ridiculous

2414.099 --> 2419.579
or

2416.859 --> 2419.5789999999997
what else

2420.52 --> 2425.8
well anything else but those two kind of

2423.46 --> 2428.44
do stand out see trolls coming back with

2425.8 --> 2430.6600000000003
that now and then even in other chats

2428.44 --> 2434.98
and I'll just address it

2430.66 --> 2434.98
rent free yeah indeed

2456.579 --> 2463.2400000000002
right yeah jerks I think Neil probably

2459.46 --> 2465.4
put an extra oh

2463.24 --> 2469.56
there

2465.4 --> 2469.56
by accident I'm not sure though

2496.359 --> 2502.0
right right yay so yeah congratulations

2499.359 --> 2507.0989999999997
Neil

2502.0 --> 2509.859
on your yard sale success 400 really

2507.099 --> 2514.2400000000002
but George Sanford says that he can buy

2509.859 --> 2514.24
it for 40 on Amazon so

2516.52 --> 2524.5
what whatever man it's not my specialty

2520.839 --> 2527.46
they sold it really for 400.

2524.5 --> 2527.46
holy [ __ ]

2537.04 --> 2541.359
oh well done hey

2541.48 --> 2546.06
somebody's willing to buy it for 400.

2549.22 --> 2555.48
nobody's stopping them I guess

2552.28 --> 2555.48
huh good one

2575.38 --> 2579.359
you're original

2577.3 --> 2579.3590000000004
um

2584.8 --> 2588.48
right that makes sense then

2589.119 --> 2593.7000000000003
as it's an original print right

2607.48 --> 2610.2
anyway

2612.4 --> 2614.4
um

2616.42 --> 2619.26
so

2620.64 --> 2625.9
Benjamin but yeah I didn't get further

2623.44 --> 2628.319
than like 10 minutes and I had to start

2625.9 --> 2628.319
the show

2641.26 --> 2647.46
oh yeah QE live and that yes computer

2644.98 --> 2647.46
man

2650.56 --> 2654.72
like he had to quit after half an hour

2655.66 --> 2660.7599999999998
so yeah I really hope he gets his

2657.46 --> 2663.2200000000003
computer computer fixed soon

2660.76 --> 2666.0600000000004
because this is kind of

2663.22 --> 2666.06
annoying

2672.7 --> 2676.359
oh right oh that yeah this was

2674.98 --> 2677.68
noteworthy

2676.359 --> 2679.42
uh

2677.68 --> 2682.24
Flat Water

2679.42 --> 2684.16
at another video yesterday about

2682.24 --> 2688.4199999999996
Patagonia

2684.16 --> 2691.5989999999997
but the Giants encountered

2688.42 --> 2694.7200000000003
in the peak

2691.599 --> 2698.38
Southern peak of South America that

2694.72 --> 2702.2999999999997
region very elaborate video although it

2698.38 --> 2702.3
is currently set to unlisted

2704.98 --> 2709.14
very very interesting video

2711.339 --> 2714.72
because of the detail

2714.94 --> 2719.8
I remember even that originally when I

2718.18 --> 2722.74
was much younger

2719.8 --> 2725.38
my parents my mother especially stumbled

2722.74 --> 2726.7
upon that sort of data like they knew

2725.38 --> 2729.339
about that

2726.7 --> 2731.4399999999996
like my family was very interested in

2729.339 --> 2734.74
Giants

2731.44 --> 2736.839
also because of that in

2734.74 --> 2739.4199999999996
because it is very elaborate is there's

2736.839 --> 2740.92
a lot of Records about it and yeah flat

2739.42 --> 2743.5
Waters video

2740.92 --> 2746.099
really digs through all of it it's very

2743.5 --> 2746.099
interesting

2746.2 --> 2748.7999999999997
huh

2749.2 --> 2756.2999999999997
Giants of the well Giants of the not too

2751.72 --> 2756.2999999999997
far past Bad Karma people that were

2757.78 --> 2760.6800000000003
seven

2760.72 --> 2766.359
to Ten Feet Tall

2763.9 --> 2768.88
like really tall people

2766.359 --> 2771.46
but also like proportionate so they had

2768.88 --> 2773.98
bigger heads too and yeah real giants

2771.46 --> 2777.0
during the age of the

2773.98 --> 2780.2400000000002
or mahalan

2777.0 --> 2780.24
Magellan sorry

2780.28 --> 2785.88
he encountered them during his journey

2782.98 --> 2789.3
and it's recorded

2785.88 --> 2789.3
in writing

2789.46 --> 2795.339
not folklore stuff actual recorded

2792.28 --> 2797.76
encounters during travels and study of

2795.339 --> 2797.7599999999998
their people

2804.22 --> 2810.18
and yeah those people were officially

2806.8 --> 2810.1800000000003
named the patagonians

2813.94 --> 2819.2200000000003
is there evidence of these Giants

2815.56 --> 2822.7
anywhere yeah all over the place

2819.22 --> 2828.24
like in in that region they still

2822.7 --> 2828.24
find like very large skeletons and [ __ ]

2828.819 --> 2834.2799999999997
but it's weird also because in the video

2831.28 --> 2837.2200000000003
is described how originally

2834.28 --> 2839.1400000000003
they were reported upon as being there

2837.22 --> 2843.04
and then later

2839.14 --> 2845.7999999999997
Travelers suddenly said no no no the

2843.04 --> 2848.02
the first ones made it up

2845.8 --> 2850.119
they kind of like tried to politically

2848.02 --> 2852.52
erase it so there might have been some

2850.119 --> 2856.119
really disgusting thing happening where

2852.52 --> 2858.88
they were like killed off in secret

2856.119 --> 2860.98
because hey longer there but they're

2858.88 --> 2862.9
still skeletons

2860.98 --> 2865.059
cultural

2862.9 --> 2867.2200000000003
scenes and [ __ ]

2865.059 --> 2869.3190000000004
and who knows maybe there's still a

2867.22 --> 2872.4399999999996
couple of them there hidden

2869.319 --> 2874.359
or in like a Subterranean face and they

2872.44 --> 2877.78
don't come out because what happened I

2874.359 --> 2879.2799999999997
don't know it's very fascinating

2877.78 --> 2882.8190000000004
oh dude

2879.28 --> 2887.4
that karma that's Magellan Magellan

2882.819 --> 2889.24
right not late 19th century

2887.4 --> 2891.48
that's like

2889.24 --> 2893.4399999999996
the 18th

2891.48 --> 2898.599
17th century

2893.44 --> 2901.54
I no no photograph but there have been

2898.599 --> 2904.38
kind of like paintings and sketches

2901.54 --> 2904.38
made of them

2904.839 --> 2910.0589999999997
so

2906.16 --> 2910.8999999999996
flat water has like pictures of that in

2910.059 --> 2913.599
his

2910.9 --> 2916.6600000000003
presentation as well

2913.599 --> 2919.5
oh no photos not of these particular

2916.66 --> 2919.5
kinds no

2930.22 --> 2936.0989999999997
right and and also by the way what I

2933.52 --> 2938.02
found even more interesting from this

2936.099 --> 2940.3
video like the guy really did his

2938.02 --> 2943.24
research but apparently

2940.3 --> 2946.9
there's even records of

2943.24 --> 2950.74
some of these people literally going

2946.9 --> 2953.98
along with the journey on ships and then

2950.74 --> 2956.5589999999997
kind of getting in trouble because they

2953.98 --> 2959.38
like became too hungry

2956.559 --> 2961.78
they needed a lot of food apparently and

2959.38 --> 2963.04
in their own lands they could easily get

2961.78 --> 2965.3190000000004
around

2963.04 --> 2967.0589999999997
that's kind of interesting

2965.319 --> 2969.579
but when they were basically

2967.059 --> 2974.46
disconnected from their land

2969.579 --> 2974.46
they they didn't survive that

2974.98 --> 2977.819
fascinating

2982.119 --> 2987.52
yes Bad Karma there have been recovered

2985.3 --> 2990.46
bones they're still recovering bones

2987.52 --> 2993.46
bones all over the place yes

2990.46 --> 2997.48
yes there were giants there were giants

2993.46 --> 2999.64
Bad Karma there were giants right and

2997.48 --> 3002.22
this is just one recording of them

2999.64 --> 3005.9
because it's not just

3002.22 --> 3005.8999999999996
southern tip of South America

3006.0 --> 3010.44
in the United States

3008.64 --> 3013.68
Mexico

3010.44 --> 3016.44
been plenty of graves stumbled upon with

3013.68 --> 3019.859
red-haired giants a different type

3016.44 --> 3022.859
so yeah Giants everywhere everywhere

3019.859 --> 3022.859
everywhere

3022.92 --> 3027.3
right

3024.119 --> 3031.4
in the north east of the Netherlands

3027.3 --> 3033.059
there's like weird ancient rave

3031.4 --> 3037.38
monoliths

3033.059 --> 3040.8
that are literally said to be built by

3037.38 --> 3043.6800000000003
giants like that's in our folklore in

3040.8 --> 3047.6400000000003
the Dutch folklore right Giants Giants

3043.68 --> 3049.7999999999997
everywhere you there were giants

3047.64 --> 3052.2
and there's a whole bunch of people that

3049.8 --> 3054.54
don't want them to have existed they

3052.2 --> 3057.839
don't want them in the narrative that's

3054.54 --> 3060.0589999999997
why among other the Smithsonian

3057.839 --> 3064.02
Institute

3060.059 --> 3068.119
has been trying to erase their existence

3064.02 --> 3068.119
since they were founded

3069.0 --> 3074.04
many occasions have been caught

3071.22 --> 3077.5789999999997
literally throwing Giant

3074.04 --> 3079.619
giant humanoid bones in the ocean

3077.579 --> 3082.6400000000003
to destroy evidence

3079.619 --> 3082.6400000000003
all that [ __ ]

3089.7 --> 3096.0589999999997
it's a dwarf conspiracy

3092.64 --> 3099.18
well no it's more like a look it's

3096.059 --> 3101.6400000000003
the history rewriters it's satanic right

3099.18 --> 3104.16
every time some group for whatever

3101.64 --> 3106.74
reason is trying to literally erase

3104.16 --> 3110.339
something that exists

3106.74 --> 3112.319
from existing from everybody knowing it

3110.339 --> 3114.839
exists then it technically becomes

3112.319 --> 3116.88
satanic because the only people that

3114.839 --> 3120.7799999999997
want to do that are the ones that

3116.88 --> 3122.2200000000003
literally want to control the world's

3120.78 --> 3124.02
memory

3122.22 --> 3126.66
that they want to mind control

3124.02 --> 3128.64
everything and the way to do that is by

3126.66 --> 3132.42
literally cutting out everything that

3128.64 --> 3134.5789999999997
doesn't fit the picture that you want to

3132.42 --> 3135.599
rub off on everybody in order to control

3134.579 --> 3138.9
them

3135.599 --> 3141.3
and Giants were not good for theirs for

3138.9 --> 3143.599
their freaking Evolution [ __ ] story

3141.3 --> 3146.88
so they literally

3143.599 --> 3149.28
arrogantly and disgustingly just decided

3146.88 --> 3151.559
okay let's just freaking destroy that

3149.28 --> 3154.559
from having ever happened

3151.559 --> 3154.559
atrocious

3170.42 --> 3176.7200000000003
right well there were still just humans

3173.7 --> 3176.72
not reptiles

3190.74 --> 3193.5789999999997
so when

3199.26 --> 3204.0200000000004
one

3200.88 --> 3204.02
you call

3204.119 --> 3208.88
well

3205.559 --> 3208.88
guns of nefarone

3213.0 --> 3217.2
she probably didn't have a recording of

3216.0 --> 3219.66
that right

3217.2 --> 3221.9399999999996
who knows man maybe like the video just

3219.66 --> 3225.0589999999997
glitched out on her maybe they did that

3221.94 --> 3227.099
on purpose to [ __ ] with her you know

3225.059 --> 3228.3
I think that's been going on like for a

3227.099 --> 3231.6600000000003
long time

3228.3 --> 3234.42
that for some reason the Grapplers up

3231.66 --> 3235.6189999999997
there they really like to [ __ ] with her

3234.42 --> 3238.38
mind

3235.619 --> 3240.78
they want her to be crazy

3238.38 --> 3243.96
they're like bullying her

3240.78 --> 3246.3
very and very nasty

3243.96 --> 3247.859
so who knows maybe they pulled one on

3246.3 --> 3249.8390000000004
her

3247.859 --> 3252.0789999999997
and then she actually thought that was

3249.839 --> 3252.0789999999997
real

3256.8 --> 3263.78
right I'm not denying her experience

3260.4 --> 3263.78
I am saying is that

3265.44 --> 3270.18
pretty certain that didn't literally

3267.66 --> 3272.04
happen but she might have thought it was

3270.18 --> 3274.9199999999996
happening and maybe they pulled one on

3272.04 --> 3276.359
her maybe they actually did

3274.92 --> 3280.799
weird

3276.359 --> 3283.859
glitch Switcheroo with a reptile rest up

3280.799 --> 3285.78
guys picture similar I don't know who

3283.859 --> 3288.5989999999997
knows what they did if it was actually

3285.78 --> 3291.42
if the video If this if the call was

3288.599 --> 3293.2200000000003
recorded as you could show it then

3291.42 --> 3295.94
yeah

3293.22 --> 3295.9399999999996
you'd know

3296.46 --> 3300.26
probably didn't happen did it

3353.04 --> 3357.839
now move the the slabs and bow back

3356.099 --> 3360.6800000000003
perhaps Michael come

3357.839 --> 3360.68
perhaps

3366.48 --> 3372.18
or maybe a combination of Giants and the

3369.9 --> 3373.859
ability to basically

3372.18 --> 3377.2799999999997
nullify

3373.859 --> 3378.299
effectively nullify the density of of

3377.28 --> 3380.4
Rock

3378.299 --> 3381.72
so that it becomes very easy to

3380.4 --> 3383.2200000000003
transport

3381.72 --> 3386.8999999999996
so

3383.22 --> 3386.8999999999996
either one or a combination

3397.4 --> 3403.5
what tiny Womble yeah oh it's so funny

3401.22 --> 3405.72
isn't it people seeing that and

3403.5 --> 3408.18
experiencing oh look there are reptiles

3405.72 --> 3411.24
are like they suddenly get reptile eyes

3408.18 --> 3414.0
yeah well

3411.24 --> 3414.8999999999996
who's to say that they literally saw

3414.0 --> 3418.859
that

3414.9 --> 3421.319
maybe it was a psychic experience and

3418.859 --> 3423.14
with that I mean it's actually

3421.319 --> 3426.359
a picture

3423.14 --> 3429.0
that your mind

3426.359 --> 3431.46
creates

3429.0 --> 3434.9
for you

3431.46 --> 3437.099
it would effectively be classified under

3434.9 --> 3439.44
hallucination because that is what

3437.099 --> 3442.579
technically would happen

3439.44 --> 3445.2000000000003
it's like a dream warning printed over

3442.579 --> 3446.28
your waking moment

3445.2 --> 3447.54
right

3446.28 --> 3450.059
and

3447.54 --> 3453.0589999999997
I think that that is not something that

3450.059 --> 3455.3390000000004
is just a delusion I think that that is

3453.059 --> 3458.7000000000003
like a mechanism

3455.339 --> 3459.96
where if somebody is like really off in

3458.7 --> 3462.299
their spirit

3459.96 --> 3465.42
and you don't consciously realize it

3462.299 --> 3468.54
that your subconscious might basically

3465.42 --> 3471.599
use your pineal activity

3468.54 --> 3475.2
to slap that visual warning

3471.599 --> 3477.78
in there so you get like a vision moment

3475.2 --> 3480.18
right as you're awaking and you see them

3477.78 --> 3481.8590000000004
as a freaking reptile I would not be

3480.18 --> 3485.52
surprised

3481.859 --> 3488.819
if that's just a thing

3485.52 --> 3491.52
like you get to see

3488.819 --> 3495.0
their spirit and this is what I've been

3491.52 --> 3496.38
suggesting no not literally physically

3495.0 --> 3499.859
reptile

3496.38 --> 3503.099
but Dark World reptile their spirit is

3499.859 --> 3505.4
reptilian and you might be able to see

3503.099 --> 3505.4
that

3508.2 --> 3513.54
doesn't mean that they are physically

3510.299 --> 3515.46
literal reptiles that are cloaked no

3513.54 --> 3518.7
it's other way around it's their

3515.46 --> 3521.88
physically human but their entire Spirit

3518.7 --> 3524.46
just doesn't reflect the original

3521.88 --> 3526.7400000000002
human spirit anymore and even themselves

3524.46 --> 3528.96
and so they might be

3526.74 --> 3531.9599999999996
at moments

3528.96 --> 3535.819
through the hallucinatory effect be

3531.96 --> 3535.819
perceived as reptiles

3537.78 --> 3541.2200000000003
that's what I think about it

3543.24 --> 3548.5789999999997
a good trick to it well no I don't think

3546.359 --> 3550.14
so I didn't get tricked at all

3548.579 --> 3551.6400000000003
no trick

3550.14 --> 3554.04
no

3551.64 --> 3557.64
he might have been mistaken right people

3554.04 --> 3560.339
that get such an experience

3557.64 --> 3563.7
how would they know

3560.339 --> 3566.7599999999998
right it's a very easy mistake to make

3563.7 --> 3569.7
like oh wow I see a persistent typical

3566.76 --> 3571.7990000000004
hallucination in unique scenarios and

3569.7 --> 3574.68
then think okay well [ __ ]

3571.799 --> 3577.319
I saw that so I'm going to completely

3574.68 --> 3579.839
just think everything is literal and so

3577.319 --> 3581.819
that must be really a reptile in some

3579.839 --> 3584.04
kind of cloaking device right it's an

3581.819 --> 3585.0589999999997
easy mistake to make

3584.04 --> 3588.859
laugh

3585.059 --> 3588.8590000000004
I don't see the problem here

3601.319 --> 3606.119
oh God Guns thanks

3616.74 --> 3621.72
it was to discredit him yeah yeah well

3620.46 --> 3624.42
you know

3621.72 --> 3627.1189999999997
used to do that [ __ ] too when people say

3624.42 --> 3629.04
oh my God I've seen aliens

3627.119 --> 3631.2000000000003
yeah yeah

3629.04 --> 3632.48
jump forward and then everybody read

3631.2 --> 3635.299
like

3632.48 --> 3638.04
he is crazy

3635.299 --> 3641.22
just not understanding anything about

3638.04 --> 3644.64
what is actually happening right I think

3641.22 --> 3647.04
that alien seeings sites

3644.64 --> 3650.94
and is he literal gray I think that's

3647.04 --> 3653.579
the same type of thing I think it is

3650.94 --> 3656.04
a hallucinatory

3653.579 --> 3659.579
vision

3656.04 --> 3662.099
or perhaps even a complete inside dream

3659.579 --> 3664.28
situation that you don't recognize as a

3662.099 --> 3664.28
dream

3664.5 --> 3670.319
like a lucid dream in which aliens

3667.02 --> 3672.24
literally come feel them

3670.319 --> 3674.339
feel them touch you or all kinds of

3672.24 --> 3675.299
creepy Sensations that typically come

3674.339 --> 3676.5
with that

3675.299 --> 3678.42
right

3676.5 --> 3680.4
that could be in a dream and they just

3678.42 --> 3683.7000000000003
didn't realize it I've actually met

3680.4 --> 3687.839
people that testified about contacting

3683.7 --> 3691.6189999999997
aliens even flying off there's some kind

3687.839 --> 3694.68
of Astral traveling weird thing and they

3691.619 --> 3697.579
didn't realize that it was a dream

3694.68 --> 3701.2799999999997
experience I literally

3697.579 --> 3705.42
confronted them face to face like dude

3701.28 --> 3708.059
what you extra describe right now

3705.42 --> 3712.28
do you realize that that's a dream

3708.059 --> 3712.28
experience and they were like

3712.38 --> 3717.6600000000003
[Music]

3715.38 --> 3719.839
they didn't understand because these

3717.66 --> 3723.5989999999997
guys there was at some UFO convention

3719.839 --> 3726.42
they were actually kind of like just

3723.599 --> 3729.44
drugged out hippies and they did have

3726.42 --> 3731.94
these persistent alien experiences

3729.44 --> 3734.28
talked about that but they didn't

3731.94 --> 3738.18
freaking know

3734.28 --> 3740.52
anything they were just too they they're

3738.18 --> 3744.18
sent they couldn't reason it through

3740.52 --> 3746.16
like I I confronted to them and they

3744.18 --> 3747.839
didn't even understand what I was saying

3746.16 --> 3750.7799999999997
they didn't even think like yeah maybe

3747.839 --> 3753.0589999999997
it was a dream they couldn't handle it

3750.78 --> 3755.1600000000003
right

3753.059 --> 3756.78
oh yeah

3755.16 --> 3758.819
I think a whole bunch of these

3756.78 --> 3761.28
experience are basically dream

3758.819 --> 3764.339
reifications and that doesn't mean that

3761.28 --> 3767.579
it's totally made up or it's all fake or

3764.339 --> 3769.64
just a random hallucination right no no

3767.579 --> 3769.6400000000003
no

3769.74 --> 3774.4199999999996
is a dream reification that's what I

3772.859 --> 3777.2
think is

3774.42 --> 3777.2000000000003
such thing

3778.079 --> 3782.88
Maybe

3780.539 --> 3785.4
right

3782.88 --> 3786.96
well that doesn't mean that it wasn't

3785.4 --> 3790.14
real though

3786.96 --> 3792.2400000000002
you know that's the thing it's just a

3790.14 --> 3795.7799999999997
visual thing

3792.24 --> 3799.2
that doesn't make it completely not real

3795.78 --> 3801.2400000000002
it's not just like oh it's just tripping

3799.2 --> 3804.1189999999997
out there

3801.24 --> 3808.2599999999998
not such a dream no it would be like

3804.119 --> 3813.1400000000003
whoa you see something extra like

3808.26 --> 3813.1400000000003
from the inside projected over it

3813.359 --> 3817.319
that doesn't make what was physically

3815.76 --> 3819.7990000000004
transpiring

3817.319 --> 3819.799
fake

3824.88 --> 3829.98
so yeah I'm pretty sure that if there's

3827.339 --> 3833.0389999999998
some kind of a divine

3829.98 --> 3835.079
contact there will be hallucinatory

3833.039 --> 3837.96
process involved it's almost a

3835.079 --> 3840.2400000000002
guaranteed as far as I'm concerned

3837.96 --> 3842.819
it doesn't make it not real it just

3840.24 --> 3845.0989999999997
means that

3842.819 --> 3849.18
the higher conscious

3845.099 --> 3852.2400000000002
simply knows exactly how to utilize the

3849.18 --> 3855.02
dream conscious of a human being in

3852.24 --> 3855.02
their communication

3859.039 --> 3864.579
demonic deception

3861.44 --> 3864.579
[Music]

3867.9 --> 3872.539
guns have never run can you please stop

3874.5 --> 3877.16
dude

3882.119 --> 3886.98
I don't want to talk about that no no

3884.94 --> 3889.26
there's [ __ ] going down I know they do

3886.98 --> 3891.66
that it just

3889.26 --> 3895.039
I don't know what to do with that it

3891.66 --> 3895.0389999999998
just makes me nauseated

3895.2 --> 3899.359
that's nothing I can add to that

3903.119 --> 3906.2000000000003
hey Adam eiken

3934.44 --> 3939.96
poking the name of Jesus immediately

3936.78 --> 3944.46
stops like the abduction experiences yes

3939.96 --> 3947.7
I can personally personally

3944.46 --> 3952.46
attest to that that's right

3947.7 --> 3956.0
in my Dark World Visions that worked

3952.46 --> 3956.0
absolutely it did

3958.98 --> 3963.92
I think that these abduction experiences

3963.98 --> 3968.96
that that's not literal it's not

3966.599 --> 3968.96
physical

3970.799 --> 3975.18
it's probably a

3973.26 --> 3979.3190000000004
hallucination

3975.18 --> 3981.7799999999997
or a dream with very dark spirits

3979.319 --> 3984.839
doing that [ __ ] to your spirit

3981.78 --> 3988.039
right not physical

3984.839 --> 3988.0389999999998
and yes

3988.14 --> 3993.5989999999997
the non-human entities

3991.38 --> 3996.599
when they screw with you

3993.599 --> 4000.5
they're very vulnerable to the invoking

3996.599 --> 4002.599
of Jesus it's correct

4000.5 --> 4006.079
a flea

4002.599 --> 4008.559
a discontinue the dream scenario when

4006.079 --> 4008.559
you do that

4009.319 --> 4015.52
but only if you understand though like

4011.599 --> 4015.52
if you truly understand the nature

4019.28 --> 4022.299
of Jesus then

4023.539 --> 4030.44
you're just gonna be chanting [ __ ]

4026.42 --> 4032.7200000000003
parts and not just evoking the name like

4030.44 --> 4034.64
just invoking it no I'm pretty sure that

4032.72 --> 4039.02
if you're gonna invoke the name and then

4034.64 --> 4041.5389999999998
talk about oh how he died and oh

4039.02 --> 4043.4
I don't think that actually works but

4041.539 --> 4045.8590000000004
just invoking the name

4043.4 --> 4048.52
poking his presence yeah that does

4045.859 --> 4048.52
actually work

4057.44 --> 4061.18
hey satan that might work

4062.48 --> 4069.4
although I don't even want Satan behind

4066.26 --> 4069.4
me like that so

4070.94 --> 4074.98
what that saying was a little weird

4075.68 --> 4079.839
but I understand the esoterics of it

4087.92 --> 4093.46
triggered moment okay that's that's okay

4089.9 --> 4093.46
see Guns of Navarone

4103.339 --> 4107.679
sorry about that didn't mean to trigger

4105.44 --> 4107.678999999999
such

4108.64 --> 4112.179
painful memories

4125.06 --> 4132.02
the dislike red dude this like ratio is

4128.12 --> 4134.3589999999995
always like that every single show every

4132.02 --> 4138.52
single show every single

4134.359 --> 4138.52
nothing to do with the thumbnail

4166.04 --> 4171.859
whoa time is flying

4168.859 --> 4171.859
foreign

4176.37 --> 4180.18
[Music]

4186.799 --> 4190.94
nope

4189.02 --> 4194.2390000000005
now we have actually been talking about

4190.94 --> 4197.419999999999
her some of her experiences

4194.239 --> 4199.4
how she saw a reptile person more of

4197.42 --> 4202.46
once yeah

4199.4 --> 4205.04
it's also funny and also silly but I

4202.46 --> 4207.26
I casually do something with right

4205.04 --> 4210.14
anything you're gonna bring forth about

4207.26 --> 4212.719
Britney I will be able to talk about it

4210.14 --> 4216.26
I will actually be able to add something

4212.719 --> 4217.88
interesting to that right so yeah hey

4216.26 --> 4221.84
you want to talk about Britney you want

4217.88 --> 4221.84
to talk about Britney fine

4222.38 --> 4226.58
ask away

4224.239 --> 4228.08
mention things I'm fine with that I'm

4226.58 --> 4231.46
perfectly fine we want to talk about

4228.08 --> 4231.46
Britney that's fine

4231.98 --> 4237.639999999999
it's what you came here for

4234.199 --> 4237.639999999999
and I'll talk about Brittany

4241.58 --> 4249.62
thought she was yeah sure grouper sure

4246.86 --> 4252.94
well if you thought that then you're not

4249.62 --> 4252.94
being very realistic

4253.28 --> 4258.259999999999
because if she was actually here live

4255.92 --> 4260.659
with me sitting right next to me or on

4258.26 --> 4263.84
another separate screen and I think my

4260.659 --> 4266.42
view count would now be around the I

4263.84 --> 4268.52
don't know 10 000 probably

4266.42 --> 4271.6990000000005
and everybody would be like who the hell

4268.52 --> 4274.76
is this weirdo and why is Brittany on a

4271.699 --> 4276.799999999999
show called Flat Earth early bird she's

4274.76 --> 4278.6
gone crazy again she has gone crazy

4276.8 --> 4280.820000000001
again right that's what would be

4278.6 --> 4283.1
actually happening so you're you're

4280.82 --> 4286.0
thinking doesn't seem to be very

4283.1 --> 4286.0
realistic here

4297.14 --> 4300.14
foreign

4302.98 --> 4308.739
by the way I wouldn't mind I wouldn't

4305.84 --> 4308.7390000000005
mind having Britney

4309.739 --> 4317.32
I I don't know maybe she would actually

4312.44 --> 4317.32
halfway appreciate me I don't know

4317.659 --> 4322.5199999999995
like I have no problem with her issues I

4321.32 --> 4324.62
think

4322.52 --> 4326.42
unless she's like Gonna Love

4324.62 --> 4329.14
back or something

4326.42 --> 4329.14
hope not

4331.6 --> 4336.14
I just I never hated her I never thought

4334.94 --> 4339.32
like you

4336.14 --> 4341.96
oh except yeah the times you know during

4339.32 --> 4346.4
after 9 11

4341.96 --> 4349.1
she was kind of like oh Pro for America

4346.4 --> 4350.659
[ __ ] she did that that was kind of

4349.1 --> 4353.08
disappointing

4350.659 --> 4353.08
right

4353.36 --> 4357.679
but it was always obvious like yeah

4355.219 --> 4359.4800000000005
she's just being used as a pawn of the

4357.679 --> 4363.04
system

4359.48 --> 4363.04
her as a person I

4366.199 --> 4371.589999999999
hate her I don't

4368.5 --> 4371.59

what

4392.0 --> 4395.659
is

4393.38 --> 4397.04
did he really say that return to normal

4395.659 --> 4399.639999999999
that's

4397.04 --> 4399.64
really

4403.94 --> 4409.599999999999
really funny

4406.04 --> 4409.6
if he actually said that

4425.48 --> 4433.178999999999
oh my god get the hell out of here that

4428.659 --> 4433.179
sailor don't bring that [ __ ] in here

4436.82 --> 4439.96

4476.6 --> 4481.64
yeah that's fine Dutch sailor I'm just

4479.48 --> 4483.799999999999
saying that's really ridiculous

4481.64 --> 4487.659000000001

the idea the rumor the tenacious [ __ ]

4553.76 --> 4559.3
Obsession rumor that everybody's a

4556.34 --> 4563.96
[ __ ] yeah yeah that's really really

4559.3 --> 4566.679
unhealthy palpably unhealthy for you to

4563.96 --> 4566.679
dwell upon

4566.96 --> 4573.14
you don't have to delete it you just

4569.12 --> 4575.84
have to realize that it's [ __ ]

4573.14 --> 4577.58
what are you gonna get out of it anyway

4575.84 --> 4580.78
nothing

4577.58 --> 4580.78
it's more squirting

4583.49 --> 4586.5599999999995
[Music]

4598.82 --> 4602.9
all right well Bad Karma

4601.34 --> 4605.679
Maybe

4602.9 --> 4605.679
I don't know

4632.42 --> 4638.84
anyone oh yeah yeah that that God I

4635.36 --> 4641.92
didn't want to bring it up Adam I knew

4638.84 --> 4641.92
somebody would

4648.62 --> 4652.0599999999995
that's okay that's fine

4652.219 --> 4656.38
I have not checked up on him at all

4676.159 --> 4678.879999999999
what

4691.219 --> 4699.04
the mothership what the hell are you

4695.6 --> 4699.04
talking about Guns of Navarone

4707.48 --> 4714.5
all right lights yeah yeah weird

4710.92 --> 4717.64
ufo-like thingies yeah yeah that's dude

4714.5 --> 4717.64
there's been many of those

4732.199 --> 4739.419999999999
but the moon map our entire realm I know

4735.5 --> 4739.42
about the rumors about it yeah

4740.06 --> 4743.4800000000005
and I also know that as soon as you

4742.28 --> 4745.82
allow

4743.48 --> 4748.699
that suggestion

4745.82 --> 4751.239
you're going to be completely lost and I

4748.699 --> 4751.239
think that

4752.6 --> 4757.400000000001
I think I see another lunatic connection

4754.76 --> 4759.8
with that right

4757.4 --> 4762.08
because oh you could sort of see

4759.8 --> 4765.56
correlations that means that there's

4762.08 --> 4767.84
whole swaths of landouts

4765.56 --> 4771.14
and there's already even signs like oh

4767.84 --> 4773.900000000001
there's been Maps Old Maps

4771.14 --> 4776.179
with things in them

4773.9 --> 4779.0
we see on the moon

4776.179 --> 4781.64
is that because the moon reflects those

4779.0 --> 4783.98
things of the reality or is that because

4781.64 --> 4785.2390000000005
people have looked at it before and

4783.98 --> 4789.0199999999995
wondered

4785.239 --> 4792.62
where are those our other continents and

4789.02 --> 4795.1990000000005
[ __ ] that we see here on this thing we

4792.62 --> 4798.679
assume is a reflection of the world

4795.199 --> 4800.839999999999
and then somebody thought hey oh let's

4798.679 --> 4802.88
actually draw that in an actual map and

4800.84 --> 4806.06
claim we've been there

4802.88 --> 4807.679
it'll drive everybody nuts

4806.06 --> 4809.659000000001
yeah

4807.679 --> 4812.62
I'm not buying it

4809.659 --> 4812.62
I'm just not

4814.82 --> 4818.32
and what good is it Anyway

4819.739 --> 4825.04
there's actually land out there then

4821.659 --> 4825.04
let's just find it

4834.56 --> 4839.4800000000005
yes I have seen it

4836.719 --> 4843.699
it wasn't issue it was like an item on

4839.48 --> 4843.699
the Flat Earth debate not too long ago

4860.96 --> 4863.62
oh

4864.56 --> 4873.76
the Masonic Fe ball yeah I'm definitely

4868.659 --> 4873.759999999999
definitely not buying that one

4876.739 --> 4882.62
there's some reifying mumbo jumbo

4880.04 --> 4886.82
[ __ ] happening in that thing God

4882.62 --> 4889.94
talk about reification in plain sight

4886.82 --> 4893.139
ridiculous I think

4889.94 --> 4893.138999999999
the Mind Trap

4923.719 --> 4929.6
yeah because if you believe that one ah

4927.62 --> 4932.179
where's your Edge

4929.6 --> 4934.360000000001
where's the edge where's the edge of the

4932.179 --> 4937.76
north that you're gonna fall off

4934.36 --> 4940.82
according to that Molly eh where's the

4937.76 --> 4944.12
edge that is literally claimed there in

4940.82 --> 4946.96
a geometric literal sense can't get more

4944.12 --> 4946.96
ridiculous guys

4947.6 --> 4954.679
serious

4949.94 --> 4954.678999999999
Sonic Fe model is preposterous

4965.239 --> 4969.218999999999
hey Gary we've been got good to see you

4969.32 --> 4973.28
all right by the way that doesn't mean

4971.54 --> 4975.86
that

4973.28 --> 4978.86
it's not interesting Michael Khan so I'm

4975.86 --> 4980.599999999999
not trying to shame you for

4978.86 --> 4982.759999999999
having it on your Channel or anything

4980.6 --> 4985.46
don't worry about that I'm just saying

4982.76 --> 4988.46
yeah seeing it thought about it it's

4985.46 --> 4988.46
preposterous

4989.3 --> 4994.34
that's not that thing there is not about

4992.3 --> 4996.679
physics at all

4994.34 --> 5001.0
it's esoteric

4996.679 --> 5003.82
reified mumbo jumbo

5001.0 --> 5006.04
really sloppy even but hey yeah the

5003.82 --> 5008.92
geometry and sort of thingies kind of

5006.04 --> 5011.44
work out yeah that's really satisfying

5008.92 --> 5015.9400000000005
to a whole bunch of people that really

5011.44 --> 5017.138999999999
really love when math things work out I

5015.94 --> 5019.419999999999
know

5017.139 --> 5022.719
when it comes to physical reality that

5019.42 --> 5025.26
entire thing is complete garbage

5022.719 --> 5025.26
laughs

5028.36 --> 5031.5
right great good

5043.96 --> 5045.96
um

5049.659 --> 5053.4
I'll be back in two minutes

5173.86 --> 5176.639
foreign

5179.56 --> 5182.56
huh

5195.94 --> 5203.5
Eric like Angel spoons No No Angel

5199.3 --> 5205.719
spoons is just a esoteric description of

5203.5 --> 5207.94
a real phenomenon so you can sell water

5205.719 --> 5209.9800000000005
that's different

5207.94 --> 5212.799999999999
right I am not

5209.98 --> 5215.678999999999
if it wasn't as if my angel spoons was

5212.8 --> 5218.4400000000005
an esoteric reification then I would

5215.679 --> 5222.52
claim that there would be literally

5218.44 --> 5226.659
like physical spoons manifesting

5222.52 --> 5228.820000000001
and with literal Angels creatures

5226.659 --> 5232.9
holding them and then stirring it around

5228.82 --> 5235.44
that would be an esoteric reification

5232.9 --> 5235.44
it

5236.86 --> 5244.239
esoteric reification is when you

5240.28 --> 5247.659
take a like a metaphorical description

5244.239 --> 5250.659
or an archetypal description that people

5247.659 --> 5253.36
understand for its esoteric value

5250.659 --> 5255.219
and then say that's literally the

5253.36 --> 5257.98
physical reality right that's an

5255.219 --> 5262.0
esoteric reification and that's what the

5257.98 --> 5265.32
Freemason model Flat Earth model does

5262.0 --> 5265.32
very blatantly

5271.96 --> 5274.56
hmm

5279.159 --> 5284.5199999999995
screw things up what no you're not

5280.96 --> 5284.52
screwing things up don't worry about it

5288.04 --> 5294.219
you don't have to delete it

5291.28 --> 5296.44
dude don't don't get all drama

5294.219 --> 5299.28
don't drama on me now but Dutch sailor

5296.44 --> 5299.28
you've been doing great

5300.76 --> 5304.179
I was just trying to warn you like

5302.98 --> 5307.839999999999
that's

5304.179 --> 5310.0
not healthy it's not a healthy subject

5307.84 --> 5312.82
right there's other types of these

5310.0 --> 5315.94
subjects out there and people obsess

5312.82 --> 5318.54
over them and it's very unhealthy and

5315.94 --> 5318.54
unproductive

5319.12 --> 5324.639
and that's all I wanted to say about it

5321.1 --> 5328.179
so don't get all sad over it I'm just

5324.639 --> 5330.46
trying to help you out that's all

5328.179 --> 5332.76
offended

5330.46 --> 5332.76
okay

5340.08 --> 5346.98
a a gem you're late yeah that's okay

5344.32 --> 5346.98
that's fine

5347.159 --> 5351.879999999999
it has to be

5349.78 --> 5355.599999999999
on time

5351.88 --> 5358.02
there's no notifications of absentees in

5355.6 --> 5358.02
this class

5378.639 --> 5383.86
yes yeah alamikin yeah that's right

5381.46 --> 5385.6
that's a good analysis that's like the

5383.86 --> 5389.32
thing about it that's interesting is

5385.6 --> 5391.92
that just One Singular Thing One

5389.32 --> 5394.599999999999
Singular thing about that crazy crazy

5391.92 --> 5397.9
esoteric readified model

5394.6 --> 5400.06
is that they attempt to find an a

5397.9 --> 5402.46
physical sort of sort of halfway

5400.06 --> 5404.139
physical explanation for the holographic

5402.46 --> 5406.36
nature of the globe of the heavens

5404.139 --> 5409.54
that's right that's like the one thing

5406.36 --> 5411.94
about it that's like hmm

5409.54 --> 5414.28
well

5411.94 --> 5418.178999999999
that part about it

5414.28 --> 5420.639
like well they tried at least

5418.179 --> 5423.1
at least they tried very tough to even

5420.639 --> 5424.36
try that

5423.1 --> 5427.719
just that

5424.36 --> 5429.88
and the entire physical nature of the we

5427.719 --> 5433.139
supposed setup just doesn't hold it

5429.88 --> 5433.139
doesn't hold up at all

5435.88 --> 5438.88
foreign

5458.46 --> 5463.44
flight in seven days well yeah probably

5463.9 --> 5469.719
somebody reminds me in time yeah sure

5467.02 --> 5474.42
I'll watch that live just like I watched

5469.719 --> 5474.42
watching ransons light

5482.219 --> 5488.5
no but steamy traveler yeah Lisa should

5485.5 --> 5493.179
create Holograms reflected like yeah but

5488.5 --> 5496.84
that's an actual engineered

5493.179 --> 5498.219
human engineered hologram right that's

5496.84 --> 5501.159000000001
technology

5498.219 --> 5502.84
when I say holographic

5501.159 --> 5504.82
referring to the globe of the heavens

5502.84 --> 5507.46
the Heavenly lights The Luminaries I'm

5504.82 --> 5509.259999999999
talking not about the Hologram

5507.46 --> 5510.88
technology

5509.26 --> 5514.6
talking

5510.88 --> 5518.62
literal word meanings hola Graham image

5514.6 --> 5522.400000000001
of light but I emphasize with doing that

5518.62 --> 5527.099999999999
is the non-euclidean

5522.4 --> 5527.099999999999
physical non-physical nature

5527.139 --> 5531.9400000000005
that it's an image of light the the

5529.54 --> 5534.12
light is the only thing about it that we

5531.94 --> 5534.12
have

5535.179 --> 5541.84
now that does not

5537.46 --> 5545.08
then automatically refer back

5541.84 --> 5547.42
to hologram technology and how we are

5545.08 --> 5549.94
supposedly able to make that

5547.42 --> 5551.62
because I don't think that it's the same

5549.94 --> 5554.138999999999
thing

5551.62 --> 5556.84
like we don't know how to make Holograms

5554.139 --> 5558.52
that literally move with us wherever we

5556.84 --> 5562.42
go

5558.52 --> 5565.659000000001
without it being fixed in some way and

5562.42 --> 5569.02
then forced to move with us the origin

5565.659 --> 5571.0
of the Hologram creation right we don't

5569.02 --> 5575.8
know how to do that at all

5571.0 --> 5577.179
so if there is some kind of mechanical

5575.8 --> 5578.92
nature

5577.179 --> 5582.34
through the holographic lobe of the

5578.92 --> 5585.46
heavens and it's made in a way that we

5582.34 --> 5588.0
simply do not understand or at least I

5585.46 --> 5588.0
don't understand

5595.0 --> 5600.28
Maybe

5596.8 --> 5602.139
the elites now woof maybe they do maybe

5600.28 --> 5604.48
they know it maybe they don't even

5602.139 --> 5606.219
understand what they know maybe they

5604.48 --> 5608.44
maybe people

5606.219 --> 5610.719
have at some point figured out what it

5608.44 --> 5612.58
is described it how how you can do

5610.719 --> 5615.88
things with it

5612.58 --> 5618.28
doesn't mean that the people that are in

5615.88 --> 5619.36
control and have that data available to

5618.28 --> 5622.0599999999995
them

5619.36 --> 5625.599999999999
actually understand what the [ __ ] is

5622.06 --> 5629.04
going on that's no guarantee at all it

5625.6 --> 5631.84
just means they know through

5629.04 --> 5634.0
instructions how to do things with it

5631.84 --> 5637.7390000000005
that doesn't mean they know what it is

5634.0 --> 5637.739
and how it even works at all

5641.32 --> 5646.299999999999
so I wouldn't be too worried about that

5643.48 --> 5649.839999999999
I think that most Elites are actually

5646.3 --> 5651.88
really [ __ ] [ __ ] in many ways and

5649.84 --> 5652.8
the only thing that they have any form

5651.88 --> 5657.04
of

5652.8 --> 5659.159000000001
consideration of Brilliance in is in how

5657.04 --> 5663.159
to control people and how to be

5659.159 --> 5663.159
absolutely merciless

5663.52 --> 5666.42
about it

5667.6 --> 5672.1
I think that's like the only

5669.699 --> 5674.86
skill they even have

5672.1 --> 5677.26
because everything else is just a

5674.86 --> 5679.299999999999
nuisance to them everything else every

5677.26 --> 5681.820000000001
other truth every other Insight only

5679.3 --> 5686.38
reminds them and how they sacrificed

5681.82 --> 5688.84
everything just for that control

5686.38 --> 5690.1
so they don't even want to know all that

5688.84 --> 5691.84
[ __ ]

5690.1 --> 5694.6
I think that's

5691.84 --> 5697.54
a more important thing to consider

5694.6 --> 5699.04
people in control they don't want to

5697.54 --> 5701.98
know everything

5699.04 --> 5704.219
they just want to know how to keep the

5701.98 --> 5704.218999999999
control

5707.92 --> 5712.42
that's fine

5709.48 --> 5716.82
dude don't take my

5712.42 --> 5716.82
energy as being a personal attack

5716.98 --> 5723.879999999999
because a lot of people say that sort of

5719.739 --> 5725.08
thing I'm just trying to give some in in

5723.88 --> 5728.88
detail

5725.08 --> 5728.88
on textual response

5729.159 --> 5734.08
you should realize about

5731.86 --> 5737.0199999999995
these people

5734.08 --> 5738.88
these virtual people that we can't

5737.02 --> 5741.580000000001
really pinpoint

5738.88 --> 5743.8
that are acting in ways

5741.58 --> 5746.76
that are part of plans

5743.8 --> 5746.76
what they're like

5747.179 --> 5752.1
we overestimate them because they have

5750.88 --> 5756.400000000001
control

5752.1 --> 5759.34
we accidentally project like minor

5756.4 --> 5761.0199999999995
godhood on them because we think that to

5759.34 --> 5762.34
be in control you have to know

5761.02 --> 5764.1
everything you have to understand

5762.34 --> 5769.119000000001
everything

5764.1 --> 5770.92
no no you don't

5769.119 --> 5773.199
that's

5770.92 --> 5776.4
projection

5773.199 --> 5776.4
because of our innocence

5777.1 --> 5779.820000000001
about that

5796.659 --> 5798.9
foreign

5801.3 --> 5807.88
than someone else well right they might

5804.82 --> 5811.78
know they might not know why or how

5807.88 --> 5814.0
that's even possible or they might look

5811.78 --> 5815.92
I'm trying to now portray like certain

5814.0 --> 5818.26
types of mindsets right of these

5815.92 --> 5821.32
controllers the elite

5818.26 --> 5822.820000000001
virtual group of people and specifically

5821.32 --> 5825.159
pinpoint

5822.82 --> 5827.199
yeah just think about it yeah they might

5825.159 --> 5829.799999999999
know there is more land there is more

5827.199 --> 5829.799999999999
right

5829.96 --> 5837.159
it's not even guarantee

5832.96 --> 5839.139
at that Insight takes them realize they

5837.159 --> 5842.159
don't live on a globe

5839.139 --> 5842.159000000001
yes guys

5843.699 --> 5848.08
think about it

5845.5 --> 5851.38
they might have the data

5848.08 --> 5853.119
not even realize

5851.38 --> 5856.26
that means

5853.119 --> 5856.259999999999
it's not a globe

5857.26 --> 5863.56
they might not get that for they have

5860.139 --> 5866.92
the available data but it doesn't mean

5863.56 --> 5870.76
they automatically have the faculties to

5866.92 --> 5875.32
put it into a wider overview context

5870.76 --> 5878.9800000000005
it might have that but only for gravel

5875.32 --> 5883.179
purposes they might only know what to do

5878.98 --> 5886.0599999999995
with it in order to get more control or

5883.179 --> 5887.86
Forge plans on the long they might know

5886.06 --> 5890.080000000001
perfectly what to do with all that

5887.86 --> 5892.9
available with with the available

5890.08 --> 5895.0
information for those purposes it

5892.9 --> 5897.299999999999
doesn't mean

5895.0 --> 5899.92
that that available information

5897.3 --> 5903.360000000001
actually provides them a complete

5899.92 --> 5903.36
oversight of a reality

5903.88 --> 5908.619
that's our innocence projection onto

5907.42 --> 5912.36
them

5908.619 --> 5912.36
think about that carefully

5927.1 --> 5930.1
foreign

5939.76 --> 5944.56
if you are truly ready for the Grapplers

5942.219 --> 5946.6
then they will never come

5944.56 --> 5949.119000000001
now if you think you're ready for the

5946.6 --> 5950.7390000000005
Grapplers but you aren't actually then

5949.119 --> 5952.599999999999
they might come

5950.739 --> 5954.839999999999
and then they will make you eat those

5952.6 --> 5954.84
words

5992.139 --> 5996.84
so now you guys are talking about Satan

5994.84 --> 5999.88
again I was actually talking about

5996.84 --> 6002.28
virtual real people people that should

5999.88 --> 6004.32
exist

6002.28 --> 6006.42
I don't know why you have to bring it

6004.32 --> 6008.96
all back to the Ethereal now when I just

6006.42 --> 6012.96
hinted you about a piece of psychology

6008.96 --> 6015.9800000000005
of real things out there

6012.96 --> 6015.9800000000005
isn't that

6016.199 --> 6021.599999999999
worth dwelling upon instead of just

6018.659 --> 6023.96
saying oh it's all satan again it'll say

6021.6 --> 6023.96
no

6028.139 --> 6033.2390000000005
how about the realization it's very

6030.84 --> 6037.56
unlikely that people that have all this

6033.239 --> 6041.94
secret data available to them actually

6037.56 --> 6044.46
understand how to put that into a wider

6041.94 --> 6046.379999999999
context in order to understand what the

6044.46 --> 6047.88
hell is going on in real

6046.38 --> 6050.9400000000005
it

6047.88 --> 6054.9800000000005
people in control don't necessarily

6050.94 --> 6054.98
understand the wider reality

6055.139 --> 6061.26
they're in control

6057.54 --> 6064.38
because they know how to use

6061.26 --> 6066.6
scalable data to maintain that control

6064.38 --> 6068.34
that they do know

6066.6 --> 6070.320000000001
doesn't mean that they actually

6068.34 --> 6072.42
understand the bigger picture because

6070.32 --> 6075.92
they have that data uniquely available

6072.42 --> 6075.92
to them you see

6076.56 --> 6082.7390000000005
it might even be a matter of simply not

6079.8 --> 6085.1990000000005
giving a [ __ ]

6082.739 --> 6087.299999999999
that they get so obsessed over power and

6085.199 --> 6090.96
control and like

6087.3 --> 6093.4800000000005
dark virtue signaling to like be the top

6090.96 --> 6096.54
guy I'm the most evil I'm the most

6093.48 --> 6099.178999999999
deservant of full power [ __ ]

6096.54 --> 6103.46
that they might just not be interested

6099.179 --> 6107.6990000000005
in the nature of actual reality at all

6103.46 --> 6110.659
except by how to manage control

6107.699 --> 6110.659
exclusively

6115.86 --> 6118.339999999999
huh

6119.46 --> 6123.42
what type of communication systems do

6121.679 --> 6125.9400000000005
the controllers use to communicate with

6123.42 --> 6129.4400000000005
one another I think I hear that telegram

6125.94 --> 6129.44
is very popular these days

6131.219 --> 6137.46
Amy Traveler

6133.199 --> 6140.94
they just use the same [ __ ] we use

6137.46 --> 6143.94
and if it's really secret and important

6140.94 --> 6146.219
if like real old papers

6143.94 --> 6149.099999999999
become relevant and they need to like

6146.219 --> 6151.7390000000005
get truly secret data out they're not

6149.1 --> 6155.46
gonna use freaking Electronics

6151.739 --> 6158.638999999999
they'll just put the paper in a suitcase

6155.46 --> 6160.8
and then travel to a location in some

6158.639 --> 6162.54
Castle or whatever and meet them face to

6160.8 --> 6164.820000000001
face and have all the electronics

6162.54 --> 6166.199
escorted outside

6164.82 --> 6168.54
in a

6166.199 --> 6169.799999999999
sealed system

6168.54 --> 6173.06
it

6169.8 --> 6173.06
they are

6173.159 --> 6177.659
any enough

6175.159 --> 6181.0199999999995
prevent actual leaks when it's really

6177.659 --> 6183.42
important they're not just gonna like

6181.02 --> 6185.159000000001
political [ __ ] stuff political

6183.42 --> 6188.1
control stuff yeah they'll be stupid

6185.159 --> 6190.799999999999
enough to just put it through the email

6188.1 --> 6193.4400000000005
talk about it and then Wikileaks get the

6190.8 --> 6195.78
email server right oh that's just

6193.44 --> 6199.32
politics

6195.78 --> 6202.38
that's not secret occult data

6199.32 --> 6203.4
they don't leak that garbage in such

6202.38 --> 6206.1
ways

6203.4 --> 6208.679
the people that could leak that sort of

6206.1 --> 6212.400000000001
[ __ ] don't even have availability they

6208.679 --> 6215.6990000000005
don't even get the touch that or might

6212.4 --> 6218.299999999999
not even be informed that it exists

6215.699 --> 6218.299999999999
right

6218.94 --> 6223.5
it's not going to be leaking you're not

6221.46 --> 6225.119
gonna get a leak it's never gonna be

6223.5 --> 6227.88
leaked

6225.119 --> 6230.4
like these people have designed ways of

6227.88 --> 6233.28
going about that are hundreds of years

6230.4 --> 6235.08
old that prevents that [ __ ] from leaking

6233.28 --> 6238.82
no matter what

6235.08 --> 6238.82
they will not make these mistakes

6238.92 --> 6243.86
if it's going to be leaked then it was

6240.84 --> 6243.860000000001
meant to be leaked

6250.5 --> 6254.179
hey Judo good to see you

6255.719 --> 6258.38
uh

6258.48 --> 6263.959999999999
uh ah Show's almost over damn it very

6261.48 --> 6263.959999999999
interesting

6264.719 --> 6271.679
a good subject today

6267.9 --> 6274.259999999999
yeah and I don't mean Britney

6271.679 --> 6276.6
hello who knows

6274.26 --> 6279.6
elephant enough

6276.6 --> 6282.4800000000005
sort of the Flat Earth but

6279.6 --> 6284.820000000001
I'll stop talking now uh

6282.48 --> 6286.138999999999
the fallen angels are on earth oh well

6284.82 --> 6288.98
oh really

6286.139 --> 6288.9800000000005
what are they

6298.92 --> 6303.9800000000005
yeah thanks my God I'm not done yet I

6301.08 --> 6303.98
still got five more minutes

6316.94 --> 6321.78
good servant what if I gave you an

6319.32 --> 6323.5199999999995
alternative cosmogonical explanation for

6321.78 --> 6327.0
that idea of Fallen Angels on earth

6323.52 --> 6329.659000000001
right what if there never were physical

6327.0 --> 6329.659
entities

6330.02 --> 6336.06
Angelic physical entities ever what if

6332.699 --> 6338.5199999999995
they that never ever existed there was

6336.06 --> 6341.580000000001
never any physical Angel fallen or

6338.52 --> 6344.820000000001
unfallen what if they are just spirits

6341.58 --> 6347.159
that are part of the other side of the

6344.82 --> 6348.659
dream world which we are as humans also

6347.159 --> 6350.638999999999
a part of

6348.659 --> 6352.619
but if they're just there and what if

6350.639 --> 6357.02
that story about the Fallen Angels is

6352.619 --> 6357.0199999999995
about how dreams got polluted

6357.54 --> 6360.139
right

6363.48 --> 6369.0
how dark

6365.28 --> 6373.34
ideas and dark desires and dark will

6369.0 --> 6373.34
leaked into the dream world

6375.06 --> 6383.2390000000005
like our internal sin that becomes that

6378.84 --> 6383.2390000000005
acts like a dark bad blossom

6383.34 --> 6389.06
suddenly popped up in our dream world

6386.159 --> 6389.0599999999995
thought about that

6392.52 --> 6397.26
you're gonna go yeah that's very cute

6395.159 --> 6399.42
think so

6397.26 --> 6402.3
I think so at all I think that the pagan

6399.42 --> 6403.9800000000005
gods as you mentioned are actually the

6402.3 --> 6406.38
lineage

6403.98 --> 6410.718999999999
of the Nephilim

6406.38 --> 6410.719
I think that those are the sons of God

6411.48 --> 6413.959999999999
right

6414.54 --> 6419.3
and what is that singular Mansion of it

6419.52 --> 6424.1
in the Bible One Singular mansion

6442.26 --> 6446.06
all right sons of God

6451.38 --> 6456.679
so I think that that's where the

6453.54 --> 6459.6
original Pantheon came from from

6456.679 --> 6462.86
actual physical creatures

6459.6 --> 6462.860000000001
offspring of God

6463.8 --> 6470.1
that word very influential perhaps even

6467.82 --> 6472.259999999999
in the physical world but I cannot

6470.1 --> 6474.6
guarantee that it might still be that

6472.26 --> 6477.6
the entire Pantheon and God's Offspring

6474.6 --> 6479.400000000001
doesn't and has never existed physically

6477.6 --> 6481.7390000000005
in the physical world that it has always

6479.4 --> 6483.42
been in the other side

6481.739 --> 6484.799999999999
and

6483.42 --> 6486.9
the more

6484.8 --> 6488.820000000001
the more you could consider that that

6486.9 --> 6489.98
might be the real realm right that's

6488.82 --> 6493.5
where

6489.98 --> 6496.218999999999
these super happy influences actually

6493.5 --> 6496.219
reside

6497.219 --> 6501.78
you don't know

6498.9 --> 6504.48
anyway it's making it very complicated

6501.78 --> 6506.58
now in last minute don't squirt too much

6504.48 --> 6509.58
over it

6506.58 --> 6512.04
but yeah I'm rounding out the show

6509.58 --> 6513.9
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you
