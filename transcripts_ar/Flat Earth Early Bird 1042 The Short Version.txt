99.84 --> 103.979
I would yesterday

101.64 --> 106.46000000000001
but then like so many different things

103.979 --> 106.46
happened

107.64 --> 112.86
I thought I gotta come on

110.22 --> 115.56
if just like half a show

112.86 --> 118.439
so I'm here

115.56 --> 121.21900000000001
all right whether today is

118.439 --> 121.219
clouded

122.0 --> 127.219
rainy every now and then but not right

124.979 --> 127.219
now

127.68 --> 133.8
it's just really clouded

130.979 --> 136.37900000000002
it was a bit of sun earlier but didn't

133.8 --> 139.26000000000002
last very long

136.379 --> 141.98
like that that clear spot is sort of

139.26 --> 141.98
over there now

142.739 --> 148.76
currently this

144.78 --> 148.76
getting in front of the Sun so

154.379 --> 158.879
all right

156.54 --> 161.459
hello America silver Patriot first in

158.879 --> 163.379
chat steamy Traveler

161.459 --> 170.04
good morning to you

163.379 --> 170.04
it is Thursday the 14th of October 2021

171.42 --> 178.57999999999998
hello Tim Burns yes yes I did hear Rob

175.26 --> 178.57999999999998
skiba passed away

180.48 --> 184.85999999999999
it was in a pretty bad shape the last

182.819 --> 186.319
time I heard from him was being captain

184.86 --> 188.94000000000003
and

186.319 --> 191.819
artificial coma

188.94 --> 195.0
so I yeah I just got the Sensation that

191.819 --> 198.0
he is he got the

195.0 --> 201.319
the special treatment

198.0 --> 201.319
which is not a good treatment

201.72 --> 206.34
but yeah was not too informed about it

204.06 --> 208.26
but apparently he has succumbed to his

206.34 --> 211.879
condition

208.26 --> 211.879
don't know exactly when it happened

214.319 --> 220.7
uh

216.36 --> 220.70000000000002
so yeah rest in peace Rob skeva

227.7 --> 230.599
I

233.159 --> 238.04
it's kind of an odd time to mention that

238.2 --> 244.5
I guess yeah like I had

241.92 --> 247.5
have distinct memories even from Rob

244.5 --> 249.36
skiba in my Visions like that are part

247.5 --> 252.019
of the early memories

249.36 --> 252.019
like

267.0 --> 272.28
I think I did actually meet him

270.06 --> 274.199
by the way I'm not sure like I thought

272.28 --> 276.419
it did show up

274.199 --> 278.82
at the Amsterdam conference but I'm not

276.419 --> 281.65999999999997
sure anymore

278.82 --> 281.65999999999997
I did meet him

284.16 --> 288.3
I might I might be getting that wrong

286.08 --> 290.69899999999996
I'm not sure

288.3 --> 292.74
uh anyway yeah that was a bit of a

290.699 --> 295.74
shocker

292.74 --> 301.1
another little new snippet

295.74 --> 301.1
yesterday another blue origin launch

301.62 --> 305.28000000000003
and uh

303.06 --> 309.419
William Shatner was in there this time

305.28 --> 312.11999999999995
that guy is he's 90. amazing he's still

309.419 --> 314.039
very vibrant

312.12 --> 316.74
for his age

314.039 --> 318.479
and yeah it was kind of funny like how

316.74 --> 321.66
he came out

318.479 --> 323.88
and he really he got emotional

321.66 --> 327.3
because I'm pretty sure this was like a

323.88 --> 329.21999999999997
a personal long time dream of his

327.3 --> 330.84000000000003
he did also talk about that but he got

329.22 --> 334.08000000000004
all gashi and

330.84 --> 337.5
then started to get in the mood of like

334.08 --> 340.68
all the infinite space and it was

337.5 --> 343.139
it was great

340.68 --> 344.88
I know some people for some reason had

343.139 --> 346.56
the impression like oh yeah when he's

344.88 --> 349.8
gonna come out he's gonna say it's flat

346.56 --> 353.12
it's like no way no no he this guy is a

349.8 --> 353.12
science fiction enthusiast

354.6 --> 359.52000000000004
and

356.28 --> 362.46
yeah I don't know I I thought it would

359.52 --> 364.979
he didn't it was real to him like the

362.46 --> 366.419
emotions were real and I just I yeah I

364.979 --> 369.0
loved it

366.419 --> 371.88
it was funny too

369.0 --> 373.86
because he really got got rolling doing

371.88 --> 376.68
his thing

373.86 --> 380.36
and that guy knows how to capture the

376.68 --> 380.36
camera so yeah that happened

383.34 --> 391.73999999999995
right sorry for moving on so quickly

386.819 --> 394.759
from the sad news of Rob skeva yes

391.74 --> 394.759
he passed away

395.58 --> 400.5
one of the

397.8 --> 402.24
early flat earthers although with him

400.5 --> 404.039
it's always been kind of controversial

402.24 --> 407.819
because

404.039 --> 410.81899999999996
it was more about the Bible and his

407.819 --> 413.699
personal way of interpreting it and how

410.819 --> 416.46000000000004
to be a Christian and then he kind of

413.699 --> 419.039
bumped into Flat Earth and had a lot of

416.46 --> 422.539
trouble with it it's all recorded

419.039 --> 422.539
that was interesting

423.66 --> 428.58000000000004
but he never really was like oh yeah I

426.479 --> 430.56
am a flatterer he he kind of kept to his

428.58 --> 434.12
own he kept doing the Bible study thing

430.56 --> 434.12
has been doing that for a while

435.96 --> 443.75899999999996
so yeah it's even like he's not really

439.639 --> 446.639
one of the flat earthers but he has been

443.759 --> 448.97900000000004
with flat earth like he was an item in

446.639 --> 452.94
there a while

448.979 --> 455.65999999999997
right perhaps keeper died no nobody dies

452.94 --> 455.66
from covet

456.0 --> 460.56
I don't know exactly what was the

458.16 --> 464.22
situation but I think that he had a lot

460.56 --> 465.419
of health problems for for a long time

464.22 --> 469.08000000000004
so

465.419 --> 472.56
if somehow C is involved it's probably

469.08 --> 474.78
just then the coborn abilities

472.56 --> 477.36
I don't know

474.78 --> 479.69899999999996
I didn't like really read into his

477.36 --> 485.24
situation too deeply

479.699 --> 485.24
but no nobody succumbs from C nobody

486.0 --> 491.039
it's like saying you're you're gonna

489.12 --> 493.74
that's like saying you died from an

491.039 --> 496.86
ingrown toenail like no that doesn't

493.74 --> 499.919
actually kill you unless your immune

496.86 --> 502.319
system is so extremely compromised that

499.919 --> 504.479
a little inflammation can basically

502.319 --> 507.24
cause like a

504.479 --> 508.86
a giant problem or something in the

507.24 --> 509.699
direction of a cytokine storm or

508.86 --> 512.88
something

509.699 --> 515.9590000000001
probably not but like yeah the

512.88 --> 515.959
comorbidities always

520.26 --> 527.12
how are things doing with you roommate

522.959 --> 530.18
said yeah fine it's all fine I'm having

527.12 --> 532.68
like really keeping to myself a lot

530.18 --> 534.779
nobody seems to be having a problem with

532.68 --> 535.92
it every time I do bump into somebody it

534.779 --> 538.8
is

535.92 --> 542.12
good it's good situation is good between

538.8 --> 542.12
the roommates and me

551.16 --> 557.54
40 days now he was artificially being

553.98 --> 557.54
kept in a coma my [ __ ]

565.26 --> 572.459
that's like and that is also part of the

569.94 --> 576.1800000000001
procedure

572.459 --> 579.3
right of the the bad procedure that has

576.18 --> 581.4799999999999
been standardized in many hospitals out

579.3 --> 581.4799999999999
there

582.0 --> 587.779
through corporate policy

585.12 --> 587.779
and

588.42 --> 592.86
so yeah that made made it very

590.76 --> 595.56
suspicious to me that I think that he

592.86 --> 598.2
might be having the uh

595.56 --> 601.38
the dangerous treatment

598.2 --> 603.0
because like why would you do that

601.38 --> 605.399
why would you

603.0 --> 607.74
anyway I don't I don't have enough

605.399 --> 611.06
information but it did sound very

607.74 --> 611.0600000000001
suspicious to me at the time

611.16 --> 615.7199999999999
like is that really

613.74 --> 618.2
necessary

615.72 --> 618.2
anyway

624.0 --> 629.899
yeah 40 days being kept in an artificial

626.579 --> 629.899
coma is very long

636.12 --> 640.74
where I went to the hospital on his own

637.98 --> 642.66
free will I I'm not sure Mike Hunt I

640.74 --> 645.0
don't know enough about it so you can

642.66 --> 647.88
keep on asking every detailed question

645.0 --> 651.2
you could ever think of I don't know I

647.88 --> 651.2
don't know all the details

654.24 --> 657.86
hello Tasmanian truther

663.54 --> 669.899
it's hard gay bad oh okay Matthew

666.18 --> 672.66
Mitchell so you know more details

669.899 --> 675.66
like how how did you learn about it I

672.66 --> 677.88
just got it from it somebody saying it

675.66 --> 679.5
in the Skype chat

677.88 --> 683.0
don't know if there was some kind of an

679.5 --> 683.0
announcement stream somewhere

693.0 --> 697.7
Mark sergeant

694.68 --> 697.6999999999999
share the news

698.64 --> 701.24
okay

705.959 --> 708.8
well when

709.32 --> 716.1
I didn't see it

712.86 --> 718.62
I do get notifications from him but I

716.1 --> 722.48
didn't see any video

718.62 --> 722.48
I wasn't on another Channel

735.72 --> 740.339
wait

737.279 --> 743.16
wait what is this

740.339 --> 745.399
did I get unbelt from Mark sergeant

743.16 --> 745.399
again

747.66 --> 751.3199999999999
what no

753.24 --> 757.6800000000001
right no I didn't get any notification

755.459 --> 759.3
of any of his streams last one was like

757.68 --> 763.519
a week ago

759.3 --> 763.519
so more than a week ago

767.639 --> 770.899
it's quite down the list

772.32 --> 775.22
on Jaron

779.88 --> 782.42
where

782.519 --> 786.899
is that like on rockfin or something

784.74 --> 789.8
because the only thing I saw was like

786.899 --> 789.8
another clip

790.98 --> 796.279
two clips that jiren uploaded last night

810.0 --> 812.54
okay

814.92 --> 821.959
yeah on rockfin all right that that

817.56 --> 821.959
explains because I I'm not far enough

875.82 --> 881.94
he had to go well what I'm wondering is

879.68 --> 884.399
whether he

881.94 --> 887.5400000000001
ever even realize they probably should

884.399 --> 887.54
have tried I

888.3 --> 896.24
horse dewormer but

891.6 --> 896.24
yeah it's all too late so afterward

908.399 --> 914.6
it's few more content for all on rockfin

911.1 --> 914.6
oh really

915.54 --> 918.62
oh I yeah

927.36 --> 930.38
let me see

943.98 --> 950.1800000000001
oh yeah I see it

946.8 --> 950.18
nine hours ago

952.38 --> 955.279
recording

956.519 --> 960.54
hmm

957.959 --> 965.2399999999999
right well I didn't know that I don't

960.54 --> 965.24
regularly check rockfin or anything

976.38 --> 981.8
but yeah I have found this stream I

979.019 --> 981.8
might check it out

1003.199 --> 1005.56
foreign

1023.48 --> 1029.0
anyway

1025.699 --> 1031.16
yeah that happened

1029.0 --> 1032.72
part of the reason why I still decided

1031.16 --> 1035.0
to get on

1032.72 --> 1037.6000000000001
and do a show after all even though it's

1035.0 --> 1037.6
a short one

1038.959 --> 1043.0
and I did also want to mention

1044.839 --> 1050.48
William Shatner from yesterday

1047.24 --> 1053.36
because it did sit through that live

1050.48 --> 1055.46
and yeah that was amusing but I guess

1053.36 --> 1058.299
that the tone is now kind of ruined

1055.46 --> 1058.299
because of Rob

1068.84 --> 1071.4399999999998
right

1080.059 --> 1086.44
yeah also

1081.74 --> 1086.44
yesterday I what I did catch was

1086.66 --> 1091.299
like a home Benjamin stream from from

1089.72 --> 1094.34
Tuesday

1091.299 --> 1096.86
two-parter that one was hilarious I

1094.34 --> 1099.559
actually ended up watching the whole

1096.86 --> 1102.6399999999999
thing twice

1099.559 --> 1102.6399999999999
it was so funny

1104.12 --> 1112.8999999999999
I see he has a new stream as well

1108.26 --> 1112.9
Wednesday I haven't seen that yet

1138.86 --> 1143.6789999999999
right hello Bobby steals

1170.36 --> 1175.52
his Sam trampoline interview was good

1173.2 --> 1178.419
yeah yeah

1175.52 --> 1178.4189999999999
it was okay

1179.6 --> 1184.24
I've seen that one too Matthew Mitchell

1207.799 --> 1211.8799999999999
I wonder what happened to Brandon toys

1209.72 --> 1214.46
Channel I think it what something

1211.88 --> 1217.88
happened to the channel or he's just on

1214.46 --> 1221.2
vacation or got a job or something

1217.88 --> 1221.2
Channel still there

1223.58 --> 1227.1399999999999
I think he's just on break

1254.299 --> 1258.34
ah man

1262.159 --> 1265.8400000000001
hello Eric one one one one

1294.62 --> 1296.799
foreign

1303.98 --> 1310.6
no magic man in the sky

1307.1 --> 1310.6
who is probably a troll

1316.52 --> 1320.559
hey Alexandra Gonzalez

1324.62 --> 1331.76
America silver Patriot okay so Rob skiba

1328.94 --> 1335.179
you did follow his scripture work

1331.76 --> 1337.82
because he was really dedicated to that

1335.179 --> 1340.22
I

1337.82 --> 1343.48
like especially a few years ago I did

1340.22 --> 1343.48
like tap into that

1344.24 --> 1349.58
because it was just very interesting

1347.24 --> 1353.559
what he was working with and how he was

1349.58 --> 1353.559
trying to work things out

1358.58 --> 1366.1999999999998
so yeah in a way it was for me Rob skiba

1362.419 --> 1368.44
too was like part of it it kind of like

1366.2 --> 1368.44
the

1369.74 --> 1376.46
The Eclectic Christian path with me a

1374.419 --> 1380.0
bit

1376.46 --> 1383.3600000000001
like developing it figuring it out like

1380.0 --> 1384.86
as an individual opposing

1383.36 --> 1387.62
others

1384.86 --> 1389.6589999999999
opposing the main typical mainstream

1387.62 --> 1393.9399999999998
view yeah that's

1389.659 --> 1393.94
I watched his streams for that too

1398.02 --> 1403.24
sixth day experiment I don't remember

1400.82 --> 1403.24
that

1420.74 --> 1423.64
foreign

1427.46 --> 1430.66
[Music]

1435.919 --> 1440.48
experiment in the Bible as to where the

1438.559 --> 1443.72
Nephilim came from right

1440.48 --> 1446.0
yeah well that is interesting

1443.72 --> 1450.799
it's still interesting

1446.0 --> 1453.82
I kind of like my own little idea I had

1450.799 --> 1453.82
is it a week ago

1454.279 --> 1461.24
when I started to ask where did the

1458.0 --> 1463.64
fish and Squid people come from then I

1461.24 --> 1466.88
tried to make everybody guess got a bit

1463.64 --> 1468.98
annoyed that nobody guessed

1466.88 --> 1471.14
and then eventually revealed like yeah

1468.98 --> 1473.1200000000001
but what if they came from the flood

1471.14 --> 1475.76
space where the water from the flood

1473.12 --> 1477.9799999999998
came from what if it was occupied and

1475.76 --> 1479.6
that's where they originally were and

1477.98 --> 1483.1
that's how they

1479.6 --> 1483.1
fell from the sky

1486.2 --> 1492.159
I wonder if Rob skiba has ever thought

1489.2 --> 1492.159
about that part

1497.24 --> 1503.659
like if we ever considered that to be a

1500.059 --> 1506.26
thing possibility of how it went down

1503.659 --> 1506.2600000000002
so anyway

1521.679 --> 1528.02
Watchman TV series had falling squids

1525.08 --> 1532.059
really is okay

1528.02 --> 1532.059
oh I didn't watch that tominoid

1536.52 --> 1539.619
[Music]

1543.679 --> 1548.8400000000001
hmm

1546.14 --> 1551.539
all right but we have examples of fish

1548.84 --> 1554.059
or what is it frogs and fish falling

1551.539 --> 1558.559
from the sky

1554.059 --> 1562.58
right but that's because yeah it can get

1558.559 --> 1565.1
like a tornado can suck up like a river

1562.58 --> 1569.1789999999999
and then basically deposit all the fish

1565.1 --> 1573.26
that were in there on the land

1569.179 --> 1576.0800000000002
right that's how fish or frogs

1573.26 --> 1578.299
or other aquatic creatures can basically

1576.08 --> 1581.1399999999999
be sucked up with a body of water and

1578.299 --> 1581.1399999999999
then deposited

1581.539 --> 1585.44
right

1583.159 --> 1587.8400000000001
and that's like

1585.44 --> 1590.24
well not super regular but those are

1587.84 --> 1592.48
typical worldly events that still just

1590.24 --> 1592.48
happen

1595.88 --> 1600.679
it doesn't require anything very

1597.919 --> 1603.2
extraordinary but it is not a common

1600.679 --> 1607.1200000000001
thing that happens right but that's not

1603.2 --> 1607.1200000000001
what I was referencing for me

1607.76 --> 1612.14
I think that like the flood water had to

1610.58 --> 1615.08
come from somewhere

1612.14 --> 1617.8400000000001
like a space where it had to be it

1615.08 --> 1620.6789999999999
didn't just physically materialize out

1617.84 --> 1623.36
of nowhere like suddenly water just

1620.679 --> 1625.8200000000002
manifests out of nothing

1623.36 --> 1627.9799999999998
within the realm can't find that seems

1625.82 --> 1629.779
unlikely so it must have come from

1627.98 --> 1632.6
somewhere

1629.779 --> 1635.72
or what if that place of somewhere was

1632.6 --> 1640.12
actually an aquatic world

1635.72 --> 1640.1200000000001
with its own beings

1649.58 --> 1653.08
came from the deep

1653.899 --> 1660.3799999999999
yeah but what is that then what from the

1657.38 --> 1662.419
deep well how did it come falling down

1660.38 --> 1664.5800000000002
then if that were the case then it would

1662.419 --> 1667.46
literally be welling up

1664.58 --> 1670.039
that's not how the flood is described

1667.46 --> 1673.1000000000001
even though yeah when they say came from

1670.039 --> 1675.94
the deep what does that mean right

1673.1 --> 1675.9399999999998
what is that

1679.279 --> 1687.039
right the firmament opened its Windows

1682.34 --> 1687.039
well wouldn't that be up there

1688.22 --> 1691.22
foreign

1693.799 --> 1698.86
a connection to another Realm

1701.899 --> 1708.7399999999998
from beneath and above

1704.299 --> 1712.399
well most of the water did go away again

1708.74 --> 1715.88
so it's not crazy to say that

1712.399 --> 1719.059
yeah Windows below also opened up like a

1715.88 --> 1722.98
drain after it got flooded

1719.059 --> 1722.98
right it's just logical mechanics

1737.72 --> 1743.72
all right but to suggest that water

1739.82 --> 1746.539
comes pouring down falling from below us

1743.72 --> 1749.299
that makes no logical sense

1746.539 --> 1751.6589999999999
that's not how material Works in this

1749.299 --> 1751.6589999999999
realm

1752.12 --> 1757.8799999999999
or space

1754.7 --> 1761.32
as above so no that's metaphysical

1757.88 --> 1761.3200000000002
that's not literal

1774.74 --> 1780.38
although it um interesting in this

1777.62 --> 1781.58
context yeah you might say okay so above

1780.38 --> 1785.419
us

1781.58 --> 1788.299
is the same thing as below us

1785.419 --> 1791.419
and not referencing to something above

1788.299 --> 1794.4189999999999
this realm and that the below is our

1791.419 --> 1796.8200000000002
realm maybe it's literally above the

1794.419 --> 1797.8990000000001
realm and below the realm As Above So

1796.82 --> 1799.22
Below

1797.899 --> 1801.9189999999999
right

1799.22 --> 1805.419
it's not entirely clear

1801.919 --> 1805.419
all depends on the context

1807.679 --> 1813.5590000000002
right I'm used to the saying As Above So

1810.98 --> 1818.1200000000001
Below referencing a micro

1813.559 --> 1821.899
uh macro micro Cosmos where the below

1818.12 --> 1824.0
would be our Realm right that's how I

1821.899 --> 1826.6999999999998
learned it esoterically

1824.0 --> 1829.22
but yeah when you literally look at the

1826.7 --> 1830.72
saying itself it could be pointing at

1829.22 --> 1835.299
all kinds of

1830.72 --> 1835.299
things as I just described

1836.72 --> 1841.52
maybe if you dig through the floor you

1838.7 --> 1844.22
come out the ceiling well that would

1841.52 --> 1846.32
make things very complicated

1844.22 --> 1848.059
right you'd have to actually be able to

1846.32 --> 1850.76
dig through the floor

1848.059 --> 1852.559
I don't think we've gone anybody's gone

1850.76 --> 1854.299
down further than eight kilometers and

1852.559 --> 1855.3799999999999
that's not even people that's just a

1854.299 --> 1858.74
drill bit

1855.38 --> 1861.2
right people don't go down that far but

1858.74 --> 1863.419
I have suggested through the rectangular

1861.2 --> 1865.82
looping mechanics that the loop might

1863.419 --> 1868.3400000000001
indeed be

1865.82 --> 1871.039
above to below as well

1868.34 --> 1872.899
that it is like circular that

1871.039 --> 1875.059
technically if there was a hole through

1872.899 --> 1877.58
it all there could be like a Perpetual

1875.059 --> 1880.76
waterfall

1877.58 --> 1884.4189999999999
that would just be going forever because

1880.76 --> 1886.82
it literally just falls down

1884.419 --> 1890.539
and then ends up in a pool where it

1886.82 --> 1894.34
eventually drains back down again from

1890.539 --> 1894.34
above something like that

1896.419 --> 1901.179
there's a joint block okay

1898.82 --> 1901.1789999999999
sure

1906.019 --> 1911.539
our realm being the middle piece would

1909.38 --> 1915.64
make more sense yeah Middle Earth that's

1911.539 --> 1915.64
right that's why I think that

1916.159 --> 1921.14
there may be other realm segments beyond

1918.679 --> 1923.299
our known realm segment

1921.14 --> 1925.88
and if there are

1923.299 --> 1927.98
it's very likely that we're the middle

1925.88 --> 1929.0
piece there's one to the north one to

1927.98 --> 1931.88
the South

1929.0 --> 1934.72
but it could be more there's no

1931.88 --> 1934.72
guarantee though

1935.899 --> 1939.34
it could be more sections

1939.98 --> 1945.2
as for physically above and below us

1943.519 --> 1947.779
well

1945.2 --> 1951.0800000000002
can't really exclude that either there

1947.779 --> 1954.14
might be like maybe we are the middle

1951.08 --> 1956.72
piece in a Rubik's Cube

1954.14 --> 1959.659
right that our realm is actually the

1956.72 --> 1963.76
middle piece in a Rubik's Cube

1959.659 --> 1963.7600000000002
and that we are surrounded by

1977.419 --> 1981.88
is it

1979.22 --> 1981.88
tough

1982.64 --> 1988.72
to 25 yeah 25 other realms

1992.0 --> 1997.159
no wait

1994.159 --> 1997.159
26.

1997.279 --> 2002.279
something like that right we don't

1999.559 --> 2002.279
exactly know

2002.7 --> 2012.059
Rubik Cubans no no just more

2008.5 --> 2012.059
realm spaces

2016.059 --> 2020.9189999999999
and who knows maybe they are connected

2019.12 --> 2024.5189999999998
or not connected or the connection

2020.919 --> 2026.5
sometimes opens and closes

2024.519 --> 2031.059
like there's

2026.5 --> 2034.0
a whole bunch of realms spatially

2031.059 --> 2036.1
like next to one another but also

2034.0 --> 2038.019
spatially cut off from one another so

2036.1 --> 2040.0
that things Loop in on itself so you can

2038.019 --> 2043.48
never reach the other realms

2040.0 --> 2046.12
but that sometimes you can sometimes it

2043.48 --> 2047.8600000000001
just connects and then you have like two

2046.12 --> 2051.46
Realms that connect

2047.86 --> 2055.679
for a period of time and then that might

2051.46 --> 2055.679
be disconnected again or whatever right

2057.46 --> 2063.2400000000002
a Rubik's Cube was only to quickly

2064.54 --> 2069.659
make an example of how it would be

2067.06 --> 2069.659
devised

2072.22 --> 2078.06
that we're surrounded by a similar realm

2074.859 --> 2078.06
space on all sides

2090.76 --> 2095.7000000000003
like a soap bubble or connect no

2096.22 --> 2102.7
no it would literally be

2099.46 --> 2105.82
a space limitation like a cube of

2102.7 --> 2109.5
available space with literally no space

2105.82 --> 2109.5
for matter to move in Beyond

2109.599 --> 2116.38
until a portal you could just call it a

2113.68 --> 2118.48
portal you know whatever man a portal

2116.38 --> 2120.94
opens between

2118.48 --> 2123.52
the available volume and then certainly

2120.94 --> 2125.64
there is a window connection between the

2123.52 --> 2125.64
two

2125.8 --> 2131.98
but there's still no more available

2127.96 --> 2133.78
space beyond the volumes of the realm

2131.98 --> 2136.78
sections

2133.78 --> 2139.3590000000004
there's no dough there's no thing this

2136.78 --> 2142.7200000000003
is not some stupid little thing you can

2139.359 --> 2145.42
look on to from the outside like oh look

2142.72 --> 2146.74
at how that's connected no there is no

2145.42 --> 2149.7000000000003
infinite room

2146.74 --> 2152.859
there is none of that it doesn't exist

2149.7 --> 2155.859
can't exist cannot be infinite volume

2152.859 --> 2155.859
period

2159.88 --> 2166.6600000000003
every realm section is available space

2163.42 --> 2169.1800000000003
not physically enclosed just available

2166.66 --> 2173.16
space there is no more space for matter

2169.18 --> 2173.16
to move into Beyond it

2174.64 --> 2180.2799999999997
and that means Beyond every single one

2177.82 --> 2182.88
of them they are all separated available

2180.28 --> 2182.88
volume

2184.24 --> 2187.3799999999997
that's what that means

2195.4 --> 2200.56
that is so bubble idea as a metaphor is

2198.16 --> 2202.96
kind of cool though like because yeah

2200.56 --> 2206.619
when you have two soap bubbles

2202.96 --> 2209.079
and they meet then they like

2206.619 --> 2212.2000000000003
start to get a circular connection and

2209.079 --> 2215.46
there's like a a barrier in between it's

2212.2 --> 2215.46
interesting how that works

2216.16 --> 2222.22
but it's not literal it's not a physical

2218.579 --> 2224.98
soap bubble barrier

2222.22 --> 2228.04
it's actual available volume for matter

2224.98 --> 2232.8
to move into on itself not a physical

2228.04 --> 2232.8
barrier with other things on the outside

2235.66 --> 2238.2599999999998
thank you

2241.66 --> 2246.46
my father's house has many rooms comes

2244.72 --> 2249.52
to mind yeah

2246.46 --> 2253.68
well that would be a very esoteric way

2249.52 --> 2253.68
to describe such a setup yeah

2254.02 --> 2258.18
hello moon buggy by the way

2291.22 --> 2293.7
hmm

2295.72 --> 2299.4399999999996
I wanted to bring it back to William

2297.52 --> 2302.02
Shatner again for a second

2299.44 --> 2303.76
because I I saw the whole thing live

2302.02 --> 2306.22
right there was not like oh William

2303.76 --> 2308.32
Shatner's doing a pre-recorded video and

2306.22 --> 2311.68
then we get to see it no it was all live

2308.32 --> 2313.54
shot so we got to see a bit of the raw

2311.68 --> 2315.839
William Shatner and that's very

2313.54 --> 2319.42
interesting the guy is interesting guys

2315.839 --> 2320.68
he's not just an old 90 year old sci-fi

2319.42 --> 2324.099
Legend

2320.68 --> 2326.68
he's an interesting man with a very rich

2324.099 --> 2330.339
internal dialogue

2326.68 --> 2332.5
and character that includes like having

2330.339 --> 2335.2599999999998
issues with other people

2332.5 --> 2337.72
and he should I have issues with other

2335.26 --> 2339.2200000000003
people I totally get that

2337.72 --> 2341.3199999999997
but

2339.22 --> 2344.859
like he was

2341.32 --> 2348.1600000000003
really using the thing

2344.859 --> 2350.14
the launch as like a personal

2348.16 --> 2353.56
exploration

2350.14 --> 2357.0989999999997
attempt because he described

2353.56 --> 2360.52
what he saw as he went up so he wasn't

2357.099 --> 2362.38
like no he was like looking outside what

2360.52 --> 2363.339
do I see what do I see he was really

2362.38 --> 2364.839
curious

2363.339 --> 2368.38
and he

2364.839 --> 2370.18
he really got like enthusiastic at the

2368.38 --> 2372.94
start of his speech before he went all

2370.18 --> 2375.2799999999997
to space mode and all

2372.94 --> 2376.18
this class typical storytelling about

2375.28 --> 2378.82
that

2376.18 --> 2382.06
before he was like yeah it was amazing

2378.82 --> 2383.92
how the transition so rapidly happened

2382.06 --> 2386.74
like there's blue everywhere and then

2383.92 --> 2389.6800000000003
suddenly like this black fell over like

2386.74 --> 2392.02
a big curtain and he really described it

2389.68 --> 2393.94
as he experienced that that was

2392.02 --> 2396.579
interesting

2393.94 --> 2399.359
right we don't get a lot of testimonies

2396.579 --> 2399.3590000000004
like that

2399.7 --> 2404.319
to see

2402.099 --> 2407.98
how how quick

2404.319 --> 2410.8
the sky color and all that changes as

2407.98 --> 2414.3
you move laterally as you move upward

2410.8 --> 2414.3
and he described that

2414.46 --> 2419.319
right

2416.619 --> 2421.839
I pay attention to these things

2419.319 --> 2424.48
right in a way I'm kind of jealous

2421.839 --> 2426.7599999999998
it's like whoa

2424.48 --> 2429.28
it's cool

2426.76 --> 2431.8590000000004
right he actually made me realize that

2429.28 --> 2434.44
partially it might be worth it I mean

2431.859 --> 2436.2999999999997
it's going to be insanely expensive such

2434.44 --> 2440.319
things but

2436.3 --> 2443.079
there's still things to figure out

2440.319 --> 2445.119
even though people are upholding the

2443.079 --> 2447.94
supposed space narrative and that's all

2445.119 --> 2451.359
known and all that they're like in the

2447.94 --> 2454.66
middle of doing that act there is still

2451.359 --> 2456.52
exploring to be done

2454.66 --> 2460.74
and I think

2456.52 --> 2460.74
William Shatner totally gets that

2461.14 --> 2467.14
right so I was yeah impressed and I like

2464.38 --> 2471.839
that he's still around and I hope

2467.14 --> 2471.839
he makes it at least another 21 years

2474.94 --> 2482.16
he certainly does still have the spirit

2478.06 --> 2482.16
to make it that long

2482.27 --> 2485.389
[Music]

2498.7 --> 2505.66
right so any any thoughts on that people

2503.319 --> 2507.579
any thoughts about that

2505.66 --> 2509.92
just gonna wait five more minutes for

2507.579 --> 2512.38
somebody to come in

2509.92 --> 2514.839
I mean this is a short enough show today

2512.38 --> 2516.52
as it is this is no longer than 55

2514.839 --> 2519.96
minutes so

2516.52 --> 2519.96
better use the time

2529.78 --> 2535.079
foreign

2531.839 --> 2535.0789999999997
I agree

2536.44 --> 2540.64
well you should realize that despite

2539.02 --> 2545.04
everything that's going on in the world

2540.64 --> 2545.04
I am a Sci-Fi Enthusiast too

2549.22 --> 2554.02
and that that's not just like oh a side

2552.46 --> 2556.599
thing

2554.02 --> 2558.7
I feel I have to do to get better

2556.599 --> 2561.3
control as a flat Earth now that's just

2558.7 --> 2561.2999999999997
a bonus

2565.119 --> 2569.44
so you think he went up in the penis

2567.22 --> 2572.2799999999997
yeah he did

2569.44 --> 2572.28
I think he did

2575.74 --> 2581.2
I mean they didn't show the footage

2578.079 --> 2582.88
while he was going right they they do

2581.2 --> 2585.64
they seem to be doing this now every

2582.88 --> 2588.46
time like they go up and then the the

2585.64 --> 2590.92
person caught the commentator

2588.46 --> 2591.76
says oh oh now they're reaching the

2590.92 --> 2594.76
height

2591.76 --> 2598.2400000000002
where they is suddenly zero g but they

2594.76 --> 2600.76
never show it they never show that

2598.24 --> 2601.9599999999996
they just say it

2600.76 --> 2604.2400000000002
right

2601.96 --> 2607.119
oh William Shatner is bound to know

2604.24 --> 2609.3999999999996
about that like he knows that he knows

2607.119 --> 2611.859
that's like partially an act

2609.4 --> 2613.78
and it doesn't mean that he can he does

2611.859 --> 2616.2999999999997
he doesn't have any maneuvering room to

2613.78 --> 2618.8390000000004
still be curious and pay attention

2616.3 --> 2618.8390000000004
right

2622.18 --> 2627.04
why do you think it gets dark as you go

2624.339 --> 2630.5789999999997
up and like William Shatner said it's a

2627.04 --> 2633.819
mystery it's a giant mystery

2630.579 --> 2636.94
of the design of the realm right

2633.819 --> 2639.4
it's very hard to find any kind of

2636.94 --> 2641.56
historical type of reference to it in

2639.4 --> 2644.92
the first place right in the Bible it's

2641.56 --> 2647.74
mentioned as daylight and night time and

2644.92 --> 2650.319
it's not even luminary based

2647.74 --> 2651.52
it's just like a background setting and

2650.319 --> 2653.859
apparently

2651.52 --> 2656.92
when you go up high enough

2653.859 --> 2659.319
the daylight makes way for black

2656.92 --> 2661.7200000000003
and that's just how it works I don't

2659.319 --> 2664.72
know why it does that

2661.72 --> 2666.0989999999997
I don't even know why the sky truly is

2664.72 --> 2668.14
blue

2666.099 --> 2670.42
everything I've learned about the

2668.14 --> 2673.54
holographic nature of the celestials I

2670.42 --> 2676.3
don't know it's like its own holographic

2673.54 --> 2679.18
thing on top of the luminaries I don't

2676.3 --> 2680.6800000000003
know why it's blue and why it gets black

2679.18 --> 2683.319
when you get out there it's one of the

2680.68 --> 2685.7799999999997
big Mysteries

2683.319 --> 2688.24
and it is fascinating to see that

2685.78 --> 2691.7200000000003
transition like when Shatner described

2688.24 --> 2695.64
it is fascinating it is a mystery

2691.72 --> 2695.64
one of the great Mysteries

2700.72 --> 2707.319
the darkness could just be the end of

2703.42 --> 2710.619
what is daylight Voynich so it's just

2707.319 --> 2713.04
the end of that what is it

2710.619 --> 2713.04
blue

2713.26 --> 2719.8590000000004
just the end of the day oh yeah it's

2715.54 --> 2722.94
just the end of it sure what is it

2719.859 --> 2722.94
why is it there

2724.96 --> 2730.42
why does the nighttime have stars but

2727.96 --> 2734.4
yet when you go up there and the black

2730.42 --> 2738.4
appears it is not accompanied by stars

2734.4 --> 2738.4
why why

2740.2 --> 2747.2799999999997
you don't know and neither do I

2744.7 --> 2749.859
think it's already a big step to have

2747.28 --> 2752.02
figured out the holographic nature of

2749.859 --> 2754.48
the celestials that's already a huge

2752.02 --> 2756.46
step that doesn't automatically mean I

2754.48 --> 2758.859
completely understand why everything

2756.46 --> 2762.28
happens the way it does

2758.859 --> 2763.96
does help a little to get misconceptions

2762.28 --> 2766.0600000000004
out of the way but it doesn't mean I

2763.96 --> 2767.56
certainly get the full understanding of

2766.06 --> 2770.7599999999998
it all

2767.56 --> 2770.7599999999998
not yet anyway

2777.4 --> 2783.04
there's no air for light to reflect off

2781.3 --> 2785.5600000000004
that's nonsense

2783.04 --> 2788.2599999999998
that's a nonsense Chris Wendell

2785.56 --> 2790.42
there is air there is air up there it's

2788.26 --> 2792.6400000000003
maybe not as thick but that doesn't

2790.42 --> 2794.5
explain why there is such a sudden

2792.64 --> 2797.3799999999997
transition like that

2794.5 --> 2799.68
like what is even lighting up the blue

2797.38 --> 2799.6800000000003
sky

2801.76 --> 2805.5400000000004
I mean

2803.44 --> 2808.92
if there's clouds in front of the sun

2805.54 --> 2808.92
it's still blue

2811.24 --> 2816.0989999999997
like one little piece out there and it's

2813.88 --> 2819.2200000000003
still blue

2816.099 --> 2822.28
it I don't understand like why it is the

2819.22 --> 2824.6189999999997
way that it is and yeah the heliocentric

2822.28 --> 2826.5400000000004
explanation is all complete horseshit

2824.619 --> 2828.339
because it presupposes all these

2826.54 --> 2830.98
physical objects being specific

2828.339 --> 2833.56
distances and none of that makes any

2830.98 --> 2837.099
damn sense

2833.56 --> 2839.68
none of it does especially

2837.099 --> 2841.7200000000003
sunlight being parallel

2839.68 --> 2843.94
until

2841.72 --> 2845.859
there's an eclipse until there's

2843.94 --> 2847.839
suddenly a sun eclipse

2845.859 --> 2849.48
the supposed moon moves in front of it

2847.839 --> 2852.339
and now

2849.48 --> 2854.559
light is no longer parallel I've

2852.339 --> 2856.18
actually given it a name in Bowl win

2854.559 --> 2858.3390000000004
mode I don't it wasn't the after show

2856.18 --> 2861.7599999999998
I'll say it right now

2858.339 --> 2864.88
the only thing that can cause this sun

2861.76 --> 2867.8190000000004
eclipse to give an amrap penumbra it

2864.88 --> 2870.88
must be lunar refraction the sunlight

2867.819 --> 2872.74
moving past the moon even though you

2870.88 --> 2875.2000000000003
can't see it before it even moves in

2872.74 --> 2876.339
front of it like at all not even a

2875.2 --> 2880.359
shadow

2876.339 --> 2882.819
when it moves past it then suddenly the

2880.359 --> 2884.5
moon surface bends the light in the

2882.819 --> 2886.599
distinct way

2884.5 --> 2888.7
so that you get the um ramp number even

2886.599 --> 2892.059
though it's all supposed to be parallel

2888.7 --> 2895.48
normally right so I'm calling it lunar

2892.059 --> 2898.1800000000003
refraction it's a machination warning

2895.48 --> 2901.38
warning machination

2898.18 --> 2901.3799999999997
lunar refraction

2901.78 --> 2906.579
Last Resort explanation as to why

2904.839 --> 2908.0789999999997
there's an umbrella penumbra during

2906.579 --> 2910.7200000000003
eclipses

2908.079 --> 2912.6400000000003
it makes no logical sense

2910.72 --> 2914.02
but it will be good enough for the

2912.64 --> 2917.7599999999998
ballers

2914.02 --> 2917.7599999999998
if they choose to accept it

2925.78 --> 2930.46
or the sources of holographic so that no

2928.3 --> 2933.1600000000003
they're what sources

2930.46 --> 2935.26
we don't even know a source point it's

2933.16 --> 2937.0589999999997
just a Celestial manifestation it's

2935.26 --> 2939.099
holographic manifestation we don't know

2937.059 --> 2941.92
where it's coming from the energy

2939.099 --> 2944.079
that generates it is probably the

2941.92 --> 2945.94
preponderance of energy in the realm

2944.079 --> 2949.1800000000003
itself

2945.94 --> 2952.119
it's not manifesting or originating from

2949.18 --> 2954.94
anywhere outside there is no outside

2952.119 --> 2958.54
there can only be an apparent outside

2954.94 --> 2960.4
through holographic misinterpretation no

2958.54 --> 2962.5589999999997
actual outside

2960.4 --> 2965.6800000000003
there is nothing outside

2962.559 --> 2971.079
there is no space outside

2965.68 --> 2973.2599999999998
now room for matter to exist in outside

2971.079 --> 2973.26
foreign

2976.68 --> 2980.22
Ralph Rodriguez

2981.22 --> 2983.819
sorry

2987.72 --> 2992.5789999999997
a dark matter is only mathematical

2995.68 --> 3000.2999999999997
and it should be completely discarded by

2998.26 --> 3002.76
now like completely because the only

3000.3 --> 3005.9
reason it existed as a concept in the

3002.76 --> 3005.9
first place is to

3007.02 --> 3009.8
and

3009.96 --> 3018.54
to balance the equation of forces based

3015.54 --> 3021.48
on Newtonian gravity conception

3018.54 --> 3024.5589999999997
Ah that's the only reason Dark Matter

3021.48 --> 3027.3
exists because of Newtonian mechanics

3024.559 --> 3029.46
well you might be in the know by now

3027.3 --> 3031.76
that Newtonian mechanics is kind of

3029.46 --> 3034.8
severely outdated it's getting

3031.76 --> 3037.7000000000003
official recognition that it's no longer

3034.8 --> 3037.7000000000003
legitimate even

3043.04 --> 3048.9
there is no dark part of the Moon

3046.02 --> 3051.42
the Moon is not an object of which

3048.9 --> 3054.54
you're looking at one side of

3051.42 --> 3058.4
it's holographic it's a light image

3054.54 --> 3058.4
there's no physical object there

3061.92 --> 3066.059
why does the gas need containment if

3064.079 --> 3069.0
there is nowhere to go well

3066.059 --> 3071.1600000000003
the inability to go anywhere is the

3069.0 --> 3074.88
containment

3071.16 --> 3078.359
if there's no room for it to move into

3074.88 --> 3082.46
then the limitation of that room is

3078.359 --> 3082.46
effectively the container

3087.3 --> 3091.6800000000003
no more space

3088.859 --> 3095.16
no more available space to move into

3091.68 --> 3098.04
that is effectively a barrier

3095.16 --> 3100.14
whether it is a barrier because of a

3098.04 --> 3103.2
physical object getting in the way or

3100.14 --> 3106.14
simply no more volume for matter to move

3103.2 --> 3108.54
into is not relevant anything relevant

3106.14 --> 3112.74
for gas pressure is that there is a

3108.54 --> 3112.74
limitation to the volume somehow

3115.5 --> 3117.74
foreign

3120.02 --> 3125.339
light energized gas within the ball

3122.88 --> 3127.7400000000002
while guiding wisdom that is a good hint

3125.339 --> 3131.7
as to

3127.74 --> 3134.4599999999996
perhaps how the sky is blue it is a Hint

3131.7 --> 3138.24
it is an indication as to where we could

3134.46 --> 3140.4
look for answers but it's not definitive

3138.24 --> 3143.0
just yet but it is an interesting

3140.4 --> 3143.0
indication

3145.2 --> 3147.859
a good point

3148.2 --> 3151.68
I've heard it before I kind of forgot

3149.819 --> 3154.68
about it

3151.68 --> 3158.64
did you hear yeah Ben White I literally

3154.68 --> 3160.7
just I I just talked about it in the

3158.64 --> 3164.04
last 15 minutes

3160.7 --> 3166.8799999999997
you think I wouldn't bring that up

3164.04 --> 3166.88
ah sorry

3170.579 --> 3177.1800000000003
it's just that yeah coming in exactly

3174.359 --> 3180.619
the second after I stopped talking about

3177.18 --> 3180.6189999999997
it that's an accomplishment

3189.48 --> 3192.9
yeah I know

3191.28 --> 3196.2000000000003
I know it's okay

3192.9 --> 3198.6600000000003
it didn't always me but it's okay I

3196.2 --> 3201.0589999999997
can't help it

3198.66 --> 3203.819
or you can help but you can just try to

3201.059 --> 3205.5
be here not five minutes before I'm

3203.819 --> 3207.42
rounding out and then

3205.5 --> 3210.3
trying to start a conversation right

3207.42 --> 3213.0
when you when you get in my chat five

3210.3 --> 3215.4
minutes before you know with certainty

3213.0 --> 3217.38
I'm gonna round out the show because I

3215.4 --> 3219.599
always ran out the show around three

3217.38 --> 3221.46
o'clock 3 P.M Amsterdam time no matter

3219.599 --> 3225.54
what

3221.46 --> 3228.059
then yeah you should know better than to

3225.54 --> 3229.859
start asking questions that would open a

3228.059 --> 3233.0
conversation because I'm not going to do

3229.859 --> 3236.7
that even if I hadn't heard about it

3233.0 --> 3239.099
but anyway yes I definitely paid

3236.7 --> 3242.04
attention to William Shatner's

3239.099 --> 3244.6800000000003
a little event and his life speech that

3242.04 --> 3247.2599999999998
he gave afterward impromptu sci-fi

3244.68 --> 3249.18
enthusiastic speech and some of his

3247.26 --> 3251.3390000000004
analysis and I thought it was really

3249.18 --> 3253.7999999999997
