[Music]

58.329 --> 65.75
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

61.969 --> 67.43
early-bird number 231 I'm your host

65.75 --> 69.259
Arwen and before we start the show

67.43 --> 71.81
please don't forget to share it on any

69.259 --> 73.49
platform you deem fit and also if you

71.81 --> 75.229
haven't already please subscribe to my

73.49 --> 76.67
channel and hit the bell notification so

75.229 --> 79.369
you know when I'm going live which is

76.67 --> 86.78
normally 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time every

79.369 --> 93.5
day so today the weather is it's just

86.78 --> 95.63
like yesterday it's awesome it's it's

93.5 --> 97.69
actually a little bit more fresh but

95.63 --> 102.92
that's even better it's yeah there's

97.69 --> 105.77
there's a lot of wind and it's not cold

102.92 --> 110.299
it's really nice and fresh it's an

105.77 --> 115.149
excellent wind temperature for this type

110.299 --> 115.149
of weather and it's just yeah awesome

118.17 --> 120.74
Hey

121.04 --> 127.31
it's so funny because there's like two

124.88 --> 134.29999999999998
hens in the neighborhood I don't know if

127.31 --> 138.14000000000001
you can hear that but yeah that creature

134.3 --> 140.21
is always having a blast and the funny

138.14 --> 142.88
thing is that when I was younger like in

140.21 --> 144.59
the teens there was a hand somewhere in

142.88 --> 146.9
the neighborhood as well but my mother

144.59 --> 149.72
hated that creature because she she

146.9 --> 151.94
would always wake up from it and weirdly

149.72 --> 154.82
enough I kind of started to hate that as

151.94 --> 158.12
well and that's also because I'm a very

154.82 --> 163.37
I used to be a very late sleeper always

158.12 --> 165.32
getting up very late I didn't enjoy

163.37 --> 168.83
getting up early at all except on

165.32 --> 170.45
Saturday morning cartoon time I had

168.83 --> 175.19000000000003
something really awesome to do then

170.45 --> 179.209
wouldn't mind but nowadays there's two

175.19 --> 182.29
hands there's one down here around the

179.209 --> 185.9
corner in the corner of the yeah and

182.29 --> 189.91
there's one at the end at the other

185.9 --> 191.27
house and I really love the sound of

189.91 --> 195.17
hands now

191.27 --> 199.239
and I don't mind if they wake me up they

195.17 --> 202.25
usually don't if I am just asleep

199.239 --> 205.489
but yeah it's such a difference with how

202.25 --> 208.67
it used to be anyway let's see who is in

205.489 --> 217.519
chat oh yeah by the way I got Tamara

208.67 --> 219.82999999999998
coffee and tea only but yeah and by the

217.519 --> 221.63
way I've been skipping so many meals

219.83 --> 224.78
recently it's weird maybe it's because

221.63 --> 228.019
I'm drinking all this lemonade I'm still

224.78 --> 230.63
eating lunch but I tend to split it up

228.019 --> 233.48000000000002
and then my second lunch is so late that

230.63 --> 236.06
eventually I just like no I'm not gonna

233.48 --> 237.709
make dinner after after 12 o'clock just

236.06 --> 241.28
don't feel like it I'm just gonna go to

237.709 --> 243.38
sleep it's weird but I'm managing I'm

241.28 --> 244.07
not feeling particularly skinny or

243.38 --> 248.269
anything

244.07 --> 251.22
although yeah it's fine

248.269 --> 255.54
that gym membership all right

251.22 --> 258.479
I've actually looked into that but the

255.54 --> 260.25
issue with that is yeah this is really

258.479 --> 262.8
annoying but I don't have a proper

260.25 --> 266.639
clothing for that kind of stuff I'm not

262.8 --> 274.65000000000003
gonna do that in these clothes it's

266.639 --> 278.22
gonna make me look like a total bum but

274.65 --> 280.08
look yeah it is good especially for the

278.22 --> 284.43
opportunities that it might bring

280.08 --> 287.55
socialize if it'll hit off if I feel it

284.43 --> 290.96
in place in the right place there but

287.55 --> 293.85
look when it comes to physical exercise

290.96 --> 297.87
every time I do something physical I

293.85 --> 302.72900000000004
make it into a light physical exercise

297.87 --> 305.16
anything I do cooking cleaning walking

302.729 --> 308.599
up and down stairs especially up and

305.16 --> 314.639
there's a big staircase right here so

308.599 --> 316.62
bicycling I just yeah and I take on

314.639 --> 321.93
tasks that nobody likes to do like

316.62 --> 325.5
carrying big bags of glass to recycle

321.93 --> 328.889
that because the rest like oh no this is

325.5 --> 331.47
heavy so nobody thinks of it and it's

328.889 --> 331.65000000000003
just piling up and like okay right I get

331.47 --> 334.199
it

331.65 --> 336.69
I'll have to do it again but then I'm

334.199 --> 338.52000000000004
like yeah okay at least I can think of

336.69 --> 344.55
something positive that I could get out

338.52 --> 349.289
of it like having a bit of exercise but

344.55 --> 353.03000000000003
yeah I still do plenty I'm not weak I'm

349.289 --> 355.169
not like feeling this weird numb

353.03 --> 358.409
sensation in my limbs because I

355.169 --> 362.31
literally just don't move him all the

358.409 --> 365.099
time because I'm like I'm totally couch

362.31 --> 369.539
potato hang out no I don't do that at

365.099 --> 371.93
all and besides every time in the past

369.539 --> 374.58
that I did have the tendencies to go and

371.93 --> 376.56
act like that because I was bored I

374.58 --> 379.05
would get nervous tics

376.56 --> 382.289
a hyperactivity would set in so it just

379.05 --> 385.2
doesn't work I've pretty much come to

382.289 --> 389.039
the realization that I can never turn

385.2 --> 392.19
fat unless I like you have to completely

389.039 --> 394.77
screw myself up with pharmaceuticals or

392.19 --> 396.659
something yeah what I don't plan to do

394.77 --> 399.63
that but when it comes to my own

396.659 --> 404.639
behavior my own way food is food habits

399.63 --> 409.61
I'm just never gonna get fat unless I

404.639 --> 413.82
like become really wealthy really quick

409.61 --> 418.62
and our in Cape I'm incapable of finding

413.82 --> 421.08
a right balance and then yeah like eat

418.62 --> 422.76
too much sadly eat chocolate all the

421.08 --> 426.51
time because oh my god I have been

422.76 --> 429.84
addicted to chocolate but it's so

426.51 --> 431.82
expensive so I eat it now but if I

429.84 --> 434.01
suddenly was wealthy I would then be

431.82 --> 437.279
seduced again to get into that so maybe

434.01 --> 445.19
I could eventually turn fat but I don't

437.279 --> 445.19
plan to so let's get to some

448.06 --> 457.58
some flatterin good morning

451.67 --> 466.6
righteous force pumpkin James Mason Elon

457.58 --> 466.59999999999997
Musk bill G flat-out faith Steve

466.81 --> 472.04
Randy flat earth good to see you

469.34 --> 484.96999999999997
Nathan Oakley Paul the horse teeth

472.04 --> 487.15000000000003
Daniel open McCool yeah good to see you

484.97 --> 487.15000000000003
all

488.56 --> 498.05
Pass Steve says I'm losing weight eating

492.17 --> 501.37
more food what it's all depends on what

498.05 --> 501.37
you're going to be eating now isn't it

506.86 --> 509.66900000000004
hmm

514.51 --> 527.1899999999999
Oh pumpkin is that you Jessica it's this

521.8 --> 527.1899999999999
like your new account I didn't know that

536.74 --> 545.11
all right yeah Paula horse teeth look

540.04 --> 547.8
the ISS visuals are a big mystery to me

545.11 --> 551.65
really and I can conspire that

547.8 --> 556.99
conspiracy theorizing lightly and I have

551.65 --> 557.88
in the past so I've had this weird weird

556.99 --> 560.95
memory

557.88 --> 563.65
it's very distant that it seems to be

560.95 --> 567.75
tied into the dark world as well that

563.65 --> 571.17
suggests to me weirdly enough talking to

567.75 --> 577.45
people that I've never even remotely met

571.17 --> 582.4599999999999
that said that in ancient Russian

577.45 --> 585.85
folklore I think I think that that is

582.46 --> 590.9100000000001
how I recognized that there was an ISS

585.85 --> 593.62
like celestial phenomena that had a name

590.91 --> 596.74
that would be visible in the sky it was

593.62 --> 601.38
like a star or like a cross and a

596.74 --> 601.38
multiple cross I think even the original

602.04 --> 609.64
Orthodox Church cross symbol may have

606.37 --> 614.8
something to do with that shape it is

609.64 --> 617.46
kind of like it remember so there was

614.8 --> 620.5
this phenomena and basically that that

617.46 --> 623.83
folklore was attacked by Jesuits and

620.5 --> 627.33
completely removed was assaulted that

623.83 --> 630.1600000000001
culture was violated and and defused

627.33 --> 633.07
there's still things of it left but it

630.16 --> 636.03
was basically a much of it was ruined

633.07 --> 639.46
and this has happened all over the world

636.03 --> 642.76
so I remember from that that there is an

639.46 --> 644.77
ISS like Star weird celestial phenomena

642.76 --> 647.88
and I think that the controllers

644.77 --> 651.4
specifically built the ISS in the shape

647.88 --> 654.96
to basically supplant that phenomena

651.4 --> 659.23
play into the weirdness of the celestial

654.96 --> 661.96
things that could be one that's one

659.23 --> 664.3000000000001
train of thinking what it could be that

661.96 --> 668.5
celestial phenomena another one could be

664.3 --> 669.88
that indeed somehow the controllers or

668.5 --> 672.72
NASA probably

669.88 --> 674.98
or some arm of it has found a way to

672.72 --> 678.82
weirdly enough project

674.98 --> 683.3100000000001
yeah holographic phenomena in in the

678.82 --> 686.22
heavens themselves and then they create

683.31 --> 689.3199999999999
apparent visual ISS like shapes

686.22 --> 691.36
specifically for such occasions and

689.32 --> 696.9100000000001
maybe they keep on doing this that's

691.36 --> 701.23
another possible explanation then

696.91 --> 703.66
another explanation is and this probably

701.23 --> 708.01
gets even kookier is that there is a

703.66 --> 711.99
specific device up there that is

708.01 --> 715.39
potentially using secret hi-tech

711.99 --> 718.51
levitation to just stay up there and

715.39 --> 721.39
float around just and it might not be

718.51 --> 725.62
the actual ISS size might just be the

721.39 --> 728.98
shape it might be smaller it might even

725.62 --> 732.22
be you can mix it up it might be just a

728.98 --> 733.84
orb thing that is projecting a hologram

732.22 --> 736.5
around it you know you don't know how

733.84 --> 739.0600000000001
far that can go once you entertain

736.5 --> 742.0
potential hidden technologies that are

739.06 --> 744.0699999999999
applied that have been speculated about

742.0 --> 747.01
it might be possible you know but yeah

744.07 --> 750.6400000000001
that's why it's conspiracy theorizing so

747.01 --> 753.97
yeah three options as to what that could

750.64 --> 756.97
be one of the options it's clearly not

753.97 --> 758.77
is an object that is orbiting the

756.97 --> 761.7900000000001
presupposed earth and falling

758.77 --> 764.59
perpetually around it at high speeds

761.79 --> 766.68
still within atmosphere and all of that

764.59 --> 772.24
makes no damn sense

766.68 --> 777.9989999999999
so that's my thought about that

772.24 --> 780.6
oh yeah maybe I could look it up I could

777.999 --> 780.6
try at least

786.14 --> 789.49
[Music]

800.92 --> 808.269
Wow okay I am only seeing Phil YouTube

804.999 --> 817.6890000000001
videos with ISS sightings where it's

808.269 --> 825.009
basically just a star I think maybe

817.689 --> 828.3689999999999
that's supposed to be it right not

825.009 --> 831.48
zooming in it's just a movie wings about

828.369 --> 836.379
like a wandering star it's ridiculous

831.48 --> 839.259
okay next one you know what I'll present

836.379 --> 841.7090000000001
it so you can look with me and we'll see

839.259 --> 841.7090000000001
where this goes

841.769 --> 844.949
hold on

850.04 --> 856.0999999999999
all right just seeing this right yeah

852.64 --> 858.61
okay so I just watched this one and it

856.1 --> 861.5600000000001
was complete waste of time

858.61 --> 864.77
okay suppose I said sighting over wrist

861.56 --> 865.7299999999999
oh okay it's short all right another

864.77 --> 870.8299999999999
light dot

865.73 --> 873.5
oh that's just freakin amazing whew yeah

870.83 --> 877.0
another waste of time

873.5 --> 877.0
okay let's try this one

885.36 --> 892.41
okay so what another dot isn't that just

889.78 --> 892.41
freaking amazing

892.5 --> 897.1
that could by the way just be a

894.79 --> 902.31
high-altitude plane with a light but

897.1 --> 905.88
yeah yeah that's just astok another dots

902.31 --> 909.9399999999999
wow this is getting really monotonous

905.88 --> 915.09
I'm not seeing any actual real zooming

909.94 --> 925.0300000000001
of the ISS maybe need ISS sighting

915.09 --> 936.51
zoomed in our bizarre don't UFO UFO your

925.03 --> 941.17
Oh nope well if it exists Google is not

936.51 --> 945.78
giving it not getting to see it through

941.17 --> 950.04
a Google search page to page three nope

945.78 --> 950.04
nope more of the same

950.34 --> 956.88
wait is that one no no no

959.55 --> 965.39
all right let's try I think I might have

961.71 --> 972.1800000000001
seen this already let's try it no

965.39 --> 975.66
freaking light man that's so look every

972.18 --> 980.25
video we've looked at obviously showed a

975.66 --> 986.76
ISS shaped thing in the sky it was so

980.25 --> 991.22
obvious it's just this yeah we were

986.76 --> 995.27
looking for an ISS sighting like

991.22 --> 999.74
actually seeing it not a 3d animation

995.27 --> 1004.99
that that was what I was looking for and

999.74 --> 1004.99
yeah wasn't there

1009.64 --> 1021.5699999999999
that's right oh you want me to look

1014.26 --> 1021.5699999999999
through telescope video ISS telescope

1023.339 --> 1029.4
video okay Google recognizes that

1043.21 --> 1046.08
hmm

1057.08 --> 1064.9089999999999
okay here's one that actually looks

1059.96 --> 1068.1100000000001
extremely interesting I'm just wondering

1064.909 --> 1072.019
about the source this was made in Japan

1068.11 --> 1073.9989999999998
it looks amazing I don't think they're

1072.019 --> 1076.94
theirs it feels like there's something

1073.999 --> 1080.32
off about it but it's really cool

1076.94 --> 1080.3200000000002
nonetheless check this out

1088.02 --> 1098.34
that it it still doesn't really look

1093.57 --> 1101.25
like physical though that it looked like

1098.34 --> 1103.32
it was a hologram or something yeah and

1101.25 --> 1108.33
now that sounds oh my good

1103.32 --> 1112.71
I know ballers I know I have suspicions

1108.33 --> 1116.1599999999999
at when when I see things but to be fair

1112.71 --> 1119.69
this is beyond any detail that I've ever

1116.16 --> 1119.69
seen before

1122.21 --> 1131.6100000000001
but just the way it's behaving like a

1125.55 --> 1133.53
mirage in in supposed midair so I don't

1131.61 --> 1135.75
get that I've never seen anything like

1133.53 --> 1143.1499999999999
that I've never seen any celestial body

1135.75 --> 1146.64
behave like that but it was really

1143.15 --> 1152.76
interesting though let's see if there's

1146.64 --> 1157.7
anything else ok this was called ISS

1152.76 --> 1160.28
through 8 there's an 8 inch telescope oh

1157.7 --> 1165.059
oh Jesus

1160.28 --> 1167.809
alright let's not do that I'll put the

1165.059 --> 1167.809
link in chat

1176.13 --> 1180.1200000000001
so you can take a look for yourself

1185.41 --> 1191.94
yeah yeah it's so extremely weird that

1189.15 --> 1194.5
we don't see that kind of atmospheric

1191.94 --> 1201.18
disturbances even from things suppose

1194.5 --> 1205.77
that the trillions of miles away yeah

1201.18 --> 1205.77
that makes so much sense doesn't it

1207.87 --> 1213.9599999999998
all right let's see what else I can find

1210.33 --> 1213.96
that's the same one

1223.2 --> 1227.73
all right this is I think I saw

1225.51 --> 1230.03
something like this before that was very

1227.73 --> 1230.03
short

1232.67 --> 1240.93
another observatory see how is that my

1238.83 --> 1243.6599999999999
telescope it's through an observatory

1240.93 --> 1250.8
you know who owns the observatories

1243.66 --> 1256.3200000000002
right I want to see it through actual

1250.8 --> 1259.05
people's telescopes you know I don't

1256.32 --> 1263.1899999999998
want some yeah some yeah government

1259.05 --> 1265.23
source or Jesuit own source to show us

1263.19 --> 1267.53
another picture that's just like asking

1265.23 --> 1267.53
NASA

1272.25 --> 1275.41
[Music]

1277.06 --> 1288.97
we yeah I just want to see these things

1279.55 --> 1290.71
not through a monopolized source so yeah

1288.97 --> 1293.8
it would be cool if somebody that has a

1290.71 --> 1301.81
really good telescope that is preferably

1293.8 --> 1304.98
not a freemason or yeah or any other

1301.81 --> 1309.07
potentially by part of some biased group

1304.98 --> 1313.09
that could show me videos that look just

1309.07 --> 1315.34
like this like life through their

1313.09 --> 1317.4099999999999
telescope that would be awesome

1315.34 --> 1324.61
that would be fascinating to me because

1317.41 --> 1327.22
that would definitely play into or it

1324.61 --> 1330.79
would started this this clue that at

1327.22 --> 1332.41
least the old star phenomena that I

1330.79 --> 1335.77
first brought on is one of the options

1332.41 --> 1339.18
because these things just that doesn't

1335.77 --> 1339.18
look like that at all

1341.34 --> 1348.58
[Music]

1344.2 --> 1352.63
anyway yeah it's an interesting subject

1348.58 --> 1352.6299999999999
one of those oddities

1363.13 --> 1366.21
okay Nathan

1367.78 --> 1378.21
but Oh key thanks for that Nathan

1386.24 --> 1394.88
okay is there any particular reason you

1391.02 --> 1394.8799999999999
sent me those images Nathan

1423.83 --> 1427.21
[Music]

1433.23 --> 1437.3890000000001
okay James Mason that's fine with me

1440.739 --> 1450.5900000000001
now Nathan's sent me some some weird

1447.46 --> 1455.979
Freemason paraphernalia pictures for

1450.59 --> 1460.2389999999998
some reason like a fedora and handcuffs

1455.979 --> 1460.239
fluffy handcuffs it was weird

1471.8 --> 1476.23
so I take Nathan is in a bit of a weird

1474.47 --> 1481.52
mood today

1476.23 --> 1484.1
so did most of you guys catch up on my

1481.52 --> 1490.6399999999999
hangout yesterday I thought it was kind

1484.1 --> 1494.9299999999998
of hilarious with Dell in a clear hey

1490.64 --> 1499.5500000000002
moon in my chat being perpetually

1494.93 --> 1503.5700000000002
sarcastic and I am was kind of sparring

1499.55 --> 1506.27
with him at it by being very nice but

1503.57 --> 1509.0
sarcastic at the same time so he could

1506.27 --> 1511.58
take it as either it's like do or

1509.0 --> 1516.32
reality wielding I thought it was

1511.58 --> 1519.49
extremely interesting to do that Dell is

1516.32 --> 1519.49
a very special person

1526.12 --> 1529.9899999999998
what the hell chuckling

1535.65 --> 1540.5900000000001
yeah he said he said that didn't hear

1538.289 --> 1540.59
anything

1544.97 --> 1551.669
yeah well and I said yeah sure but not

1549.95 --> 1556.14
unconditionally so there are some

1551.669 --> 1560.3090000000002
certain conditions you'll have to have

1556.14 --> 1568.039
to do certain conditions he's gonna have

1560.309 --> 1568.039
to fulfill yeah that's it

1568.96 --> 1574.549
[Music]

1580.35 --> 1583.82
Thank You pumpkin

1586.18 --> 1595.5700000000002
I try to to me I don't know you yeah

1593.55 --> 1598.57
think of it whatever you want but

1595.57 --> 1604.51
sometimes it feels very much like all

1598.57 --> 1606.7
this intellectual armwrestling it feels

1604.51 --> 1609.73
very much like dueling in the

1606.7 --> 1612.81
Renaissance to me so I try to be as much

1609.73 --> 1616.8700000000001
as a gentleman as eloquent as I can

1612.81 --> 1619.74
because I do I do think I'm good at what

1616.87 --> 1625.2399999999998
I do I have a lot of confidence and

1619.74 --> 1628.63
skill combined and that because I worked

1625.24 --> 1630.94
on it and then it's just like yeah I

1628.63 --> 1633.1000000000001
could just like brutally just slaughter

1630.94 --> 1636.46
him and make me and let the demon come

1633.1 --> 1639.6999999999998
out but that's like excessive doesn't

1636.46 --> 1643.96
show a good side of me and I don't need

1639.7 --> 1646.3
to so I thought okay I could just start

1643.96 --> 1650.8600000000001
sparring with him and basically handing

1646.3 --> 1654.52
him out gifts at the same time because I

1650.86 --> 1657.37
do think that they'll really like he's

1654.52 --> 1661.66
always in the tough guy mode but he's

1657.37 --> 1664.51
just a guy just a kid like a kid is a

1661.66 --> 1668.77
kid in him as well who just wants to be

1664.51 --> 1671.86
yeah be around people and be appreciated

1668.77 --> 1672.73
and all that but he's just too stubborn

1671.86 --> 1675.9599999999998
to admit it

1672.73 --> 1678.67
even to himself so then he gets all his

1675.96 --> 1682.48
weird passive-aggressive moods and

1678.67 --> 1685.3300000000002
everything and I just recognized the

1682.48 --> 1685.8700000000001
pattern because I've been there to some

1685.33 --> 1689.6499999999999
degree

1685.87 --> 1691.86
I've had that same kind of effect get

1689.65 --> 1695.8000000000002
like a curse at the deal with that

1691.86 --> 1699.85
pretty early on and I think like yeah it

1695.8 --> 1702.43
did I just see it I just I'd hope for

1699.85 --> 1705.33
him to get over that so that he could

1702.43 --> 1709.27
move on and get back to some more

1705.33 --> 1711.22
constructive ways to spend his time

1709.27 --> 1712.84
because he could definitely do that

1711.22 --> 1715.15
remember the street activism and

1712.84 --> 1717.31
everything it's like yeah why don't you

1715.15 --> 1719.23
just do that again you get out there

1717.31 --> 1719.83
you'll meet new people that will satisfy

1719.23 --> 1723.33
the

1719.83 --> 1732.12
NEADS and you'll have something to do it

1723.33 --> 1732.12
for that's how I try to do things so

1733.98 --> 1741.3600000000001
this is ready oh you can be such a troll

1744.21 --> 1753.13
yeah yeah by the way Randy I'll try to

1749.169 --> 1755.289
pay a little bit more attention with the

1753.13 --> 1757.2
new presentations on your show it seems

1755.289 --> 1760.059
that every time you are starting that up

1757.2 --> 1763.059
there's a lot of other video activity

1760.059 --> 1765.1589999999999
going on at the same time and then yeah

1763.059 --> 1766.889
especially with jam pana just hearing

1765.159 --> 1770.5900000000001
him do his thing

1766.889 --> 1772.9289999999999
it's like eventually I was starting to

1770.59 --> 1777.9399999999998
fall asleep so I just switched I hope

1772.929 --> 1781.539
you don't mind but I'm hearing good

1777.94 --> 1783.13
feedback and like I understand the setup

1781.539 --> 1786.1299999999999
and it's good it's still in the starting

1783.13 --> 1789.7600000000002
phase it's good probably will pay a lot

1786.13 --> 1792.929
more attention in the near future but

1789.76 --> 1796.95
anyway I was watching Owen Benjamin

1792.929 --> 1799.63
pretty much instead and that was just

1796.95 --> 1803.22
he's really getting fired up and he

1799.63 --> 1807.49
found some interesting concepts that

1803.22 --> 1809.6490000000001
shockingly resonated well with me and it

1807.49 --> 1813.72
was hilarious at the same time he was

1809.649 --> 1816.6299999999999
basically fooling around with the the

1813.72 --> 1821.26
stereotype group of the baby boomers and

1816.63 --> 1824.95
then yeah very complicated started to do

1821.26 --> 1828.19
some kind of social engineering joke

1824.95 --> 1831.3700000000001
with it and it was pretty it was pretty

1828.19 --> 1835.049
hysterical like I bet some people

1831.37 --> 1841.33
literally choked on on their own

1835.049 --> 1843.61
yeah from that was amazing because what

1841.33 --> 1851.35
he basically suggested in very rough

1843.61 --> 1857.5
lines was that I always does that that

1851.35 --> 1861.03
the that the Jews are further distant

1857.5 --> 1864.61
from the Christians then Muslims are

1861.03 --> 1866.68
like from a spiritual technical

1864.61 --> 1870.58
perspective and he's kind of right about

1866.68 --> 1873.22
that like he really made a good point

1870.58 --> 1876.27
there and then he said okay so the

1873.22 --> 1879.46
baby-boomers they want to go with israel

1876.27 --> 1883.3899999999999
basically it's very over generalized but

1879.46 --> 1888.01
still there is some rough line validity

1883.39 --> 1890.8300000000002
to it so it's interesting set up and so

1888.01 --> 1893.65
maybe then the Christians the genuine

1890.83 --> 1897.1599999999999
Christians should just make peace with

1893.65 --> 1900.5800000000002
the Muslims because there is there are

1897.16 --> 1903.91
definitely leads that Muslims are being

1900.58 --> 1910.48
set up and manipulated presumably in

1903.91 --> 1913.1200000000001
this case by the Jews and yeah there's

1910.48 --> 1917.95
yeah there's an interesting chemistry to

1913.12 --> 1921.37
that like percentage possibility logic

1917.95 --> 1923.26
behind it and I find it fascinating so

1921.37 --> 1928.4199999999998
he just said okay let's just make peace

1923.26 --> 1933.04
with with Islam and then bind together

1928.42 --> 1934.9
against the boomers and the Jews it was

1933.04 --> 1937.71
pretty yeah

1934.9 --> 1944.5900000000001
pretty extreme and crazy and funny and

1937.71 --> 1948.46
interesting an interesting thought and I

1944.59 --> 1950.6499999999999
myself have also as I share it on my

1948.46 --> 1954.42
show and before the early bird show even

1950.65 --> 1958.69
I have some respect for for Islam and

1954.42 --> 1963.97
while we have talked with is it with

1958.69 --> 1967.15
Reese only Shippo can see he's more

1963.97 --> 1970.33
studied into Islam and yeah we talked

1967.15 --> 1972.3100000000002
about that and yeah you you only confirm

1970.33 --> 1974.25
that to me like there is something to it

1972.31 --> 1978.55
but at the same time there's these

1974.25 --> 1982.69
extremists but what are they what how do

1978.55 --> 1984.45
they get to that point cause all the

1982.69 --> 1988.6100000000001
Muslims that I meet yeah they

1984.45 --> 1991.8300000000002
may have some like weird cultural issue

1988.61 --> 1993.6
that and it's being overly encouraged so

1991.83 --> 1996.9299999999998
they're kind of like seduced by Western

1993.6 --> 2000.29
society - yeah emphasize bad behavior

1996.93 --> 2001.21
maybe but but over in general no not at

2000.29 --> 2007.87
all

2001.21 --> 2014.3600000000001
most are really just polite and decent

2007.87 --> 2017.05
so how do the extremists really what are

2014.36 --> 2021.2299999999998
they because I'm pretty certain that

2017.05 --> 2025.04
extremists also fall under like sort of

2021.23 --> 2027.79
a secret surface angle of Islamic

2025.04 --> 2032.51
countries that that would make sense

2027.79 --> 2035.6299999999999
it's not like secret service of like the

2032.51 --> 2037.55
real black ops secret service of Western

2035.63 --> 2040.94
countries are that kind of a good guys

2037.55 --> 2044.84
no absolutely not so there's that and

2040.94 --> 2046.22
then there's this there's just seem to

2044.84 --> 2050.7999999999997
be like these people that are like

2046.22 --> 2056.84
driven to be dupes or something

2050.8 --> 2061.0600000000004
they're like indoctrinated maybe III

2056.84 --> 2061.06
wonder how that really happens and

2066.82 --> 2071.8900000000003
because you'd have to be pretty manic to

2069.22 --> 2077.3799999999997
basically say okay I'm gonna destroy I'm

2071.89 --> 2080.5299999999997
going to attack the public because they

2077.38 --> 2083.4100000000003
are all infidels like that's not a

2080.53 --> 2085.53
normal human way of thinking so how did

2083.41 --> 2089.35
they get to that point they have to be

2085.53 --> 2095.3100000000004
enraged pretty much have to be hurt

2089.35 --> 2098.16
probably in some way and then that manic

2095.31 --> 2101.25
destructive way of thinking has to be

2098.16 --> 2103.48
emphasized and basically ingrained

2101.25 --> 2108.64
indoctrinated somehow otherwise that

2103.48 --> 2111.76
doesn't make any sense so it just made

2108.64 --> 2114.67
me think like what is real what is that

2111.76 --> 2117.7000000000003
really what is Islamic terrorism really

2114.67 --> 2120.67
what is going on there I think that the

2117.7 --> 2126.1899999999996
idea of the Islamic terrorists has been

2120.67 --> 2127.9300000000003
over generalized I categorized but that

2126.19 --> 2131.58
what it contains is much more

2127.93 --> 2136.81
complicated it's almost like a black ops

2131.58 --> 2142.18
scam scapegoat type thing that groups

2136.81 --> 2145.02
can just enter as an act as a cover

2142.18 --> 2145.02
maybe

2151.569 --> 2159.729
and that could be a lot of groups it's

2157.089 --> 2163.359
almost like it's almost a sort of

2159.729 --> 2165.249
free-for-all for a secret services that

2163.359 --> 2167.709
they could always try to set up a

2165.249 --> 2172.9199999999996
suppose that Islamic terror attack or

2167.709 --> 2175.4489999999996
some kind of terror attack and then oh

2172.92 --> 2178.539
and then certain groups may be very

2175.449 --> 2182.0190000000002
easily duped very easily drafted into

2178.539 --> 2184.3590000000004
this kind of a setup they might have

2182.019 --> 2186.1299999999997
systems to do that they might be

2184.359 --> 2188.859
systematic in their internet

2186.13 --> 2192.119
indoctrination methods by now but just

2188.859 --> 2196.66
take certain type of dupes

2192.119 --> 2200.259
draft them in and then like totally

2196.66 --> 2204.91
overwhelm them with things and just yeah

2200.259 --> 2209.789
turn them into these manic super

2204.91 --> 2217.019
soldiers manic robots to perform a task

2209.789 --> 2221.579
yeah religiously driven probably so yeah

2217.019 --> 2221.5789999999997
anyway I thought it was interesting and

2223.65 --> 2234.699
yeah I also like that I didn't know well

2231.489 --> 2236.4990000000003
maybe I did know yeah I think I didn't

2234.699 --> 2239.38
know Reese didn't actually share that

2236.499 --> 2243.069
Islam recognizes Christ and all that as

2239.38 --> 2246.19
a prophet it's just that yeah through

2243.069 --> 2249.849
the typical boomer media maybe you could

2246.19 --> 2254.739
call it boomer media now that it's

2249.849 --> 2259.67
always pointing at the at some extreme

2254.739 --> 2264.33
more like extreme rights

2259.67 --> 2266.58
Islamist preacher Imam that then just to

2264.33 --> 2272.0699999999997
the Western dinner and then it's just

2266.58 --> 2275.13
hyped like that is all of Islam and I

2272.07 --> 2278.03
used to kind of fall for that even ten

2275.13 --> 2280.8900000000003
years ago I I didn't know any better I

2278.03 --> 2286.2900000000004
didn't know enough about about what

2280.89 --> 2288.5099999999998
Islam really is and yeah just got a very

2286.29 --> 2292.23
a rough feel for it and it it and herbed

2288.51 --> 2302.94
me at many points before I got to know

2292.23 --> 2307.83
it but ya know Benjamin now says every

2302.94 --> 2311.46
time he talks about Mohammed and then he

2307.83 --> 2314.93
says may God rest his soul and I think

2311.46 --> 2318.39
that's interesting because yeah why not

2314.93 --> 2321.5699999999997
he made some very good arguments for the

2318.39 --> 2325.5
set up also the issues the presupposed

2321.57 --> 2327.29
issues of pedophilia with Mohammed or

2325.5 --> 2331.77
because he married what is it is

2327.29 --> 2335.39
eight-year-old girl and then people say

2331.77 --> 2339.72
oh my god that is that is horrifying

2335.39 --> 2342.42
he's abusing that but yeah I think that

2339.72 --> 2346.83
Owen Benjamin then basically emphasized

2342.42 --> 2352.37
well it's different because he promises

2346.83 --> 2354.6
to be her yeah her husband and Guardian

2352.37 --> 2359.91
for the rest of his life he's never

2354.6 --> 2363.21
gonna separate and so that's not abuse

2359.91 --> 2366.0299999999997
it's more like a multiple it's almost

2363.21 --> 2369.51
like you become a father and then you

2366.03 --> 2376.7400000000002
become a husband and it seems very

2369.51 --> 2379.59
archaic but that is not abuse its it

2376.74 --> 2381.3599999999997
doesn't yeah even to me that just when I

2379.59 --> 2383.2200000000003
think about it like that it's like no as

2381.36 --> 2385.9500000000003
long as you're not gonna have sex when

2383.22 --> 2388.2
it's like way too young you know that

2385.95 --> 2390.5099999999998
that's just wrong that's always gonna be

2388.2 --> 2392.1
wrong but to marry her and then be your

2390.51 --> 2398.4300000000003
guardian

2392.1 --> 2402.5099999999998
and then eventually when ya get kids I

2398.43 --> 2405.83
don't know it just it's not the same as

2402.51 --> 2409.7400000000002
like pedophiles that just when he

2405.83 --> 2412.5299999999997
sodomized little children I loose yuck

2409.74 --> 2414.8399999999997
that is totally different from that it's

2412.53 --> 2418.9500000000003
not the same thing and I agree with Owen

2414.84 --> 2422.58
Benjamin about that it was always it's

2418.95 --> 2424.41
always felt wrong in a way back in the

2422.58 --> 2430.64
day when people would say that about him

2424.41 --> 2433.44
but that was usually in response to the

2430.64 --> 2439.0499999999997
just and this is really real the

2433.44 --> 2441.69
intolerance of criticism or what they

2439.05 --> 2447.1800000000003
considered and blasphemy on the Prophet

2441.69 --> 2449.9700000000003
Muhammad may God rest his soul and that

2447.18 --> 2453.4199999999996
is like yeah does it doesn't it's not

2449.97 --> 2455.91
very compatible with free speech Western

2453.42 --> 2459.54
society with or whatever is left of it

2455.91 --> 2462.99
right now and it was a response to that

2459.54 --> 2467.37
and then it's like yeah you we want to

2462.99 --> 2470.25
be able to kind of misbehave towards the

2467.37 --> 2473.8199999999997
Prophet Muhammad because of free speech

2470.25 --> 2477.42
and they do it to Christians as well and

2473.82 --> 2480.15
Christ and all that and that's not all

2477.42 --> 2489.83
of them so by the way it's apparently

2480.15 --> 2489.83
just the more extreme tongued Imams so

2494.599 --> 2498.9100000000003
yeah yeah thanks Chuck

2508.24 --> 2517.49
but yeah it's anyway it's a good point

2511.49 --> 2520.1299999999997
look from we've kind of been taught to

2517.49 --> 2523.93
kind of like follow the money trail to

2520.13 --> 2526.579
unravel what's going on in media in

2523.93 --> 2528.5
situations and people take it all over

2526.579 --> 2532.13
the place and then completely conspiracy

2528.5 --> 2534.859
is theorized into oblivion about the

2532.13 --> 2536.75
crazies of things but in general a lot

2534.859 --> 2538.25
of people have now learned to just

2536.75 --> 2540.44
figure out like what's really going on

2538.25 --> 2542.93
is what's really going on being

2540.44 --> 2548.66
reflected by the communications or not

2542.93 --> 2552.89
and we need to take that step further

2548.66 --> 2554.99
because like from the boomer perspective

2552.89 --> 2556.97
we already know like oh the deep state

2554.99 --> 2560.0
is doing pulling [ __ ] off they're trying

2556.97 --> 2562.0099999999998
to trick us yeah and that's true that is

2560.0 --> 2565.28
technically true that situation is

2562.01 --> 2568.119
correct but then it's politicized

2565.28 --> 2577.4500000000003
over-generalized and Islam is more

2568.119 --> 2580.609
blamed for it than the Jews all that and

2577.45 --> 2585.74
now we need to learn to use this skill

2580.609 --> 2587.99
to basically every time and think about

2585.74 --> 2590.1189999999997
this carefully and it might even be a

2587.99 --> 2592.069
little bit risky every time there's like

2590.119 --> 2595.46
a supposed Islamic terror attack

2592.069 --> 2600.64
somewhere there needs to be public

2595.46 --> 2605.69
investigation like who are these people

2600.64 --> 2607.8489999999997
did they really how did they come to do

2605.69 --> 2611.77
that what is it really what the media

2607.849 --> 2614.69
says it is or are they just like

2611.77 --> 2619.46
criminals because criminals can get

2614.69 --> 2622.76
pretty crazy too or some guy that has

2619.46 --> 2624.19
like a yeah it's going all wrong with

2622.76 --> 2625.88
his life and he's getting

2624.19 --> 2628.91
self-destructive and he's like yeah I

2625.88 --> 2631.1600000000003
want to go out gangster style you know

2628.91 --> 2634.3999999999996
it doesn't need to be Islamic terrorism

2631.16 --> 2637.1299999999997
but that could be put on top of a

2634.4 --> 2638.839
situation so I think that as the public

2637.13 --> 2641.1
and we shouldn't just leave this to the

2638.839 --> 2644.0099999999998
media we should every time

2641.1 --> 2647.45
figure out is this really an Islamic

2644.01 --> 2653.34
terror attack or is this really a

2647.45 --> 2655.47
extreme right-wing neo-nazi or that type

2653.34 --> 2658.4100000000003
of that yeah we already know okay that's

2655.47 --> 2660.81
usually gonna be [ __ ] but we need to

2658.41 --> 2661.91
do that with the Islamic terror attacks

2660.81 --> 2668.7
too

2661.91 --> 2672.39
do you understand because I think that

2668.7 --> 2675.93
these people this wide group is

2672.39 --> 2677.85
basically being put a blame is putting

2675.93 --> 2680.94
being put in their shoes that is not

2677.85 --> 2684.27
theirs even though they do have problems

2680.94 --> 2688.53
that need to be resolved in order for

2684.27 --> 2691.98
them to completely yeah in for the long

2688.53 --> 2694.8900000000003
run but I think that there are things

2691.98 --> 2701.76
put in their shoes that's not really

2694.89 --> 2703.2599999999998
their stabling really like that yeah the

2701.76 --> 2708.0600000000004
people involved could be blamed for

2703.26 --> 2711.2400000000002
foolishness or delusion maybe but

2708.06 --> 2715.92
there's just some some people putting

2711.24 --> 2718.4399999999996
them up to it and are these these Imams

2715.92 --> 2720.87
is it truly all traced back to that are

2718.44 --> 2724.4700000000003
they the organizers or are they just

2720.87 --> 2726.56
rabble rabble trying to sound like tough

2724.47 --> 2728.8799999999997
guys because there's a lot of men

2726.56 --> 2730.89
surrounding them that really liked that

2728.88 --> 2733.02
tough-guy attitude it gives them like

2730.89 --> 2734.73
who this guy's alpha I want to follow

2733.02 --> 2736.71
him and they don't necessarily care

2734.73 --> 2740.72
about that literally they don't want to

2736.71 --> 2746.13
go fanatically with that I don't know

2740.72 --> 2749.1499999999996
you know they're all still people with

2746.13 --> 2749.15
people needs

2751.72 --> 2758.2389999999996
[Music]

2767.42 --> 2774.03
right libertarians are God well the

2771.93 --> 2780.33
funny thing is I do kind of consider

2774.03 --> 2785.5800000000004
myself a libertarian but libertarianism

2780.33 --> 2789.6
is more a concept it's more an ideology

2785.58 --> 2792.33
than an actual form of government it's

2789.6 --> 2798.0
an ideal situation you want to work

2792.33 --> 2801.27
towards because if you technically

2798.0 --> 2803.82
literal eyes all of it according to the

2801.27 --> 2810.02
principles yeah there are very there are

2803.82 --> 2810.02
risks that

2814.8 --> 2819.65
so I don't completely agree with Owen

2817.35 --> 2823.5899999999997
Benjamin that it is completely useless

2819.65 --> 2827.55
but if you take the perfected the ideal

2823.59 --> 2830.3700000000003
version of it and like force that that

2827.55 --> 2833.82
probably wouldn't work either I agree

2830.37 --> 2836.67
with him on that but as a concept to

2833.82 --> 2839.1000000000004
work towards that as an ideal situation

2836.67 --> 2845.07
as much as possible I think that is a

2839.1 --> 2860.45
worthwhile pursuit it's a good way to

2845.07 --> 2862.7400000000002
conduct yourself at least alright

2860.45 --> 2865.52
libertarians as in a political party

2862.74 --> 2870.8999999999996
okay I'm not talking about that at all

2865.52 --> 2875.22
look that's the problem every time with

2870.9 --> 2878.3
political parties they start up as like

2875.22 --> 2881.7
a group like we want to be represented

2878.3 --> 2884.55
then they catch on then

2881.7 --> 2887.16
the professionals start to infiltrate it

2884.55 --> 2890.6400000000003
with promises like yeah we can really

2887.16 --> 2892.83
make this real and then money is put

2890.64 --> 2896.46
into it that businesses are tied in it

2892.83 --> 2899.25
becomes a real political party and then

2896.46 --> 2901.56
those people that got into it that made

2899.25 --> 2904.2
that promise will be big then they take

2901.56 --> 2906.99
over and then they use the original

2904.2 --> 2909.4199999999996
concepts that drafted it into existence

2906.99 --> 2914.25
in the first place as a cover as a

2909.42 --> 2918.1800000000003
mantle for another control structure

2914.25 --> 2923.24
it's what happens every single time it's

2918.18 --> 2923.24
terrible it's terrible

2928.219 --> 2934.68
and if it doesn't happen then usually

2931.41 --> 2937.8289999999997
the the ones that prevent that from

2934.68 --> 2940.009
happening get assassinated and in the

2937.829 --> 2942.869
Netherlands we've seen that happen

2940.009 --> 2948.239
exactly because of that because of his

2942.869 --> 2950.099
relentless halt like nope not gonna do

2948.239 --> 2950.489
it like that anymore and then he got

2950.099 --> 2953.2490000000003
killed

2950.489 --> 2971.13
and most of you Dutch people know

2953.249 --> 2973.7389999999996
exactly who I'm talking about is there

2971.13 --> 2977.579
nobody from the Netherlands in chat

2973.739 --> 2980.9
right now I feel stupid I should know

2977.579 --> 2984.38
his name it's on the tip of my tongue I

2980.9 --> 2984.38
can't find it

3008.809 --> 3013.699
of course nobody's gonna respond to that

3016.429 --> 3038.5190000000002
oh yeah BIM for time that's it

3030.359 --> 3039.659
right I hate typing things into Google

3038.519 --> 3044.9089999999997
like murders

3039.659 --> 3046.38
I hate doing that I was kind of hoping

3044.909 --> 3048.7490000000003
somebody else would figure it out

3046.38 --> 3051.779
because I just don't want to input those

3048.749 --> 3053.7889999999998
kind of words in there I don't want to

3051.779 --> 3056.759
give it suggested that I'm actually

3053.789 --> 3060.9590000000003
interested in that very concept in any

3056.759 --> 3064.109
way because the AI takes any kind of

3060.959 --> 3065.999
sign as corruption and then start to

3064.109 --> 3070.5589999999997
attack you with it I've noticed that

3065.999 --> 3075.959
every single time Google is getting

3070.559 --> 3078.2090000000003
quite well AI algorithms in general that

3075.959 --> 3083.3089999999997
are staring programs that are arranging

3078.209 --> 3086.3689999999997
setups programs that are guiding it

3083.309 --> 3089.029
they're getting very hostile to me

3086.369 --> 3089.029
sometimes

3102.91 --> 3116.92
hmm it's weird I'm having this weird

3112.079 --> 3124.9300000000003
tingly feeling seems to be it's almost

3116.92 --> 3127.17
like there's a my are wind senses are

3124.93 --> 3130.5
tingling that's how to know what it is

3127.17 --> 3130.5
it's annoying

3139.069 --> 3144.869
yes I read that as well middle road ISS

3142.71 --> 3151.2200000000003
fighters in Syria we're being paid huge

3144.869 --> 3153.7200000000003
amounts of dollars a month yep yeah and

3151.22 --> 3156.24
I'm getting more and more comfortable

3153.72 --> 3158.5789999999997
with just putting it out there that it

3156.24 --> 3161.16
seems that that's just in this case

3158.579 --> 3163.29
blame the deep state even though we know

3161.16 --> 3166.71
it's probably just the entire a US

3163.29 --> 3168.72
military apparatus or the well maybe

3166.71 --> 3173.7
it's really specifically the deep state

3168.72 --> 3178.6699999999996
but the neo cons are definitely part of

3173.7 --> 3183.0589999999997
that as well they have pretty much

3178.67 --> 3187.19
created and funded Isis and that all

3183.059 --> 3191.059
started even with the the list al-qaeda

3187.19 --> 3195.569
that was officially CIA found it and

3191.059 --> 3201.1800000000003
they just put more into it they they

3195.569 --> 3208.109
expanded that concept like a Koval they

3201.18 --> 3211.14
created a covert boogeyman and again

3208.109 --> 3213.359
that is also the theatrical set up that

3211.14 --> 3216.42
I just tried to explain earlier a

3213.359 --> 3221.75
theatrical set up of Islamic terrorism

3216.42 --> 3225.66
and a lot of things can be done and then

3221.75 --> 3228.359
take cover under Islamic terrorism or

3225.66 --> 3230.79
something or yeah if it's like a

3228.359 --> 3233.91
political wrestling situation then it's

3230.79 --> 3240.9
just blamed on the opponent but yeah

3233.91 --> 3247.049
this this is the issue they've created a

3240.9 --> 3251.19
virtual tool a violence a virtual

3247.049 --> 3254.0099999999998
violence tool to manipulate with that

3251.19 --> 3257.599
covert groups can utilize as a setting

3254.01 --> 3257.599
with support of the media

3265.559 --> 3274.7290000000003
oh my god chuckles saying did you

3268.049 --> 3274.729
actually follow that debate that was I

3275.119 --> 3282.359
don't know I I I couldn't I've seen

3280.259 --> 3289.14
fragments of it it was so idiotic it's

3282.359 --> 3290.8489999999997
just like why would anyone watch that it

3289.14 --> 3293.359
was a complete waste of time everything

3290.849 --> 3293.3590000000004
about it

3301.839 --> 3308.319
I think I'd rather sit through an entire

3304.749 --> 3310.39
session of Jose with just ballers circle
