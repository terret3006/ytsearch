6.68 --> 36.759
[Music]

39.17 --> 46.89
good morning welcome to flatter the

43.079 --> 49.079
earlybird number 235 I'm your host

46.89 --> 50.85
Arwen and before we start show please

49.079 --> 53.04
don't forget to share it on any platform

50.85 --> 55.019
you deem fit and also if you haven't

53.04 --> 56.64
already subscribed to my channel and hit

55.019 --> 58.739
the bell notification so you know when

56.64 --> 63.39
I'm going live which is normally 2 p.m.

58.739 --> 65.369
Amsterdam time every day so yeah also

63.39 --> 69.05
please support my show through the

65.369 --> 73.77
superjet paypal patreon and my GoFundMe

69.05 --> 78.33
so the weather today is well looks

73.77 --> 79.14
pretty beautiful right now but yeah in

78.33 --> 83.67
the morning

79.14 --> 86.479
and there was still a lot of cam trading

83.67 --> 92.0
going on but it's almost like it's

86.479 --> 95.22
either blown Norway or hazed down

92.0 --> 97.71
because all I can see right now are just

95.22 --> 100.67999999999999
more regular clothes so you can see some

97.71 --> 103.78999999999999
of it still in the distance above those

100.68 --> 103.79
other clouds there

107.049 --> 113.02000000000001
but yeah beautiful sunny day again

121.75 --> 132.89
yeah there's not so much wind there's

126.2 --> 134.77
not so much wind today so I've got to

132.89 --> 140.69
merit coffee with me today

134.77 --> 146.81
tea that's it

140.69 --> 150.77
I already got lunch pretty early on yeah

146.81 --> 155.18
yesterday was a crazy day for me my

150.77 --> 160.33
internet got shut off again like in the

155.18 --> 162.95000000000002
middle of a debate like I was during the

160.33 --> 169.27
Flat Earth debates I just got cut off

162.95 --> 172.19
and didn't go back on this time so I

169.27 --> 174.53
yeah I tried to communicate with my

172.19 --> 176.66
roommate when you gonna be back

174.53 --> 179.15
well she said no I'm gonna be working to

176.66 --> 180.88
9:00 so probably gonna be back at 11:00

179.15 --> 189.22
oh goody

180.88 --> 192.14
so that means like six hours so then I

189.22 --> 196.22
got yeah kind of like depressed about it

192.14 --> 198.17
I guess not really bad just like me I'm

196.22 --> 202.79
gonna do now yeah the weather is nice I

198.17 --> 206.26999999999998
guess yeah I went to buy some beers four

202.79 --> 207.709
of them and yeah I still had wine so I

206.27 --> 211.22
thought okay I'll first I'll just get

207.709 --> 215.57
some beers do whatever we play a game

211.22 --> 219.59
watch a movie and I did I watched the

215.57 --> 222.67
Pacific Rim the second one again it was

219.59 --> 226.76
pretty cool so the entertaining movies

222.67 --> 229.07
good enough for a second watch and yeah

226.76 --> 233.989
but then the roommate proceeded to come

229.07 --> 238.51999999999998
back for me and expectedly soon at half

233.989 --> 243.79
past nine so I got get back on missed

238.52 --> 243.79000000000002
some stuff missed ya

244.17 --> 249.73
and it was kind of like a half-drunk and

247.689 --> 252.909
everything and I get barely even

249.73 --> 255.09
remember what happened the rest of the

252.909 --> 255.09
night

264.71 --> 269.13899999999995
I just know I didn't stay up too late

269.35 --> 280.31
let's see yeah I think I jumped on the

275.539 --> 285.919
on the on the premiere oh yeah and I

280.31 --> 293.84
think I I I did get to see a piece of

285.919 --> 295.96999999999997
the ranty Roundtable aftermath show with

293.84 --> 298.33
adam back and forth that was kind of

295.97 --> 298.33000000000004
okay

310.889 --> 318.40000000000003
so yeah I'm today a little bit like walk

315.07 --> 320.38
down because of thats my own fault just

318.4 --> 323.21999999999997
went way overboard with the with the

320.38 --> 328.33
drinks shouldn't have done that

323.22 --> 331.69000000000005
mm-hm and tonight's ain't gonna be D and

328.33 --> 334.9
D so I'm just gonna take take it slow

331.69 --> 337.449
today and tomorrow or tomorrow and

334.9 --> 341.52
evening I'll be fully back to normal

337.449 --> 341.52000000000004
again so

351.46 --> 358.58
Oh God

354.08 --> 362.389
but yeah let's just let earth debates

358.58 --> 365.33
yeah there's a new there's a new person

362.389 --> 366.74
on the scene and he's causing a half

365.33 --> 374.21
causing havoc

366.74 --> 381.169
it's called spur scheme oh I just find

374.21 --> 383.56899999999996
the whole thing and settling like if

381.169 --> 385.69899999999996
this if this [ __ ] is gonna continue on

383.569 --> 388.389
the in the way that he has done it so

385.699 --> 393.259
far and it's just gonna be allowed to be

388.389 --> 398.87
done I like I'm just gonna do other

393.259 --> 402.139
things if it happens today also now I

398.87 --> 405.289
know he's not new but this first chemo

402.139 --> 409.009
what he's doing now that's not how I

405.289 --> 413.87
remember him it's just gone it's just

409.009 --> 419.44
gonna nuts he's tried something new and

413.87 --> 419.44
now he won't let go and it's ridiculous

420.009 --> 423.72900000000004
yeah overboard

425.35 --> 430.84000000000003
you know if it was just a regular

427.51 --> 433.09
thought experiment I would actually go

430.84 --> 435.72999999999996
with it because I can do that [ __ ] too

433.09 --> 441.28
like okay they'll presuppose this then

435.73 --> 443.23
what if how and all that but that's not

441.28 --> 445.02
what's per schemas do and he's just

443.23 --> 448.96000000000004
literally trying to indoctrinate

445.02 --> 450.66999999999996
something out of the way by constantly

448.96 --> 454.75
saying we don't sense it we don't do

450.67 --> 458.56
this we don't it's just those are

454.75 --> 463.57
declarations so it seems like he's just

458.56 --> 466.75
trying to improvising lis indoctrinate

463.57 --> 469.63
gas pressure out of the way it's crazy I

466.75 --> 473.74
it doesn't make any sense on the long

469.63 --> 476.23
run that he's doing that no peanuts

473.74 --> 479.08
Clark he's not redefining pressure he's

476.23 --> 482.17
trying to negate it he's trying to say

479.08 --> 487.45
it's not a thing that it's only

482.17 --> 490.41
temperature before you spend hours on it

487.45 --> 490.40999999999997
yesterday

496.699 --> 501.10900000000004
and I find it really unsettling

504.93 --> 512.64
yeah that's ridiculous look there's a

509.4 --> 514.4599999999999
there's a temperature correlation with

512.64 --> 519.27
pressure definitely that's how

514.46 --> 521.88
refrigeration even works you know but to

519.27 --> 525.14
say it's a it is the only thing that's

521.88 --> 525.14
not what's going on

529.17 --> 537.26
you know temperature isn't just conjured

532.53 --> 540.62
out of nothing it happens because of

537.26 --> 544.9399999999999
pressure change it's a side effect

540.62 --> 550.86
there's a correlation between them

544.94 --> 556.2
pressure change tends to cause you have

550.86 --> 558.84
this weird temperature change and that's

556.2 --> 561.1500000000001
just a separate effects but then say no

558.84 --> 564.11
the temperature is the thing that is

561.15 --> 566.76
changed no that's not what's going on

564.11 --> 572.16
it's not the same field really because

566.76 --> 575.79
the overall pressure is really there's a

572.16 --> 578.52
differential and where the temperature

575.79 --> 584.66
change comes in is usually in the area

578.52 --> 587.91
where the pressure is exchanged where

584.66 --> 591.75
yeah not in the in the b'm in the middle

587.91 --> 593.4599999999999
of the body but at the exchange point

591.75 --> 596.67
that's where the temperature starts to

593.46 --> 599.61
set in so that to say that it is like a

596.67 --> 601.86
causal thing the only temperature it

599.61 --> 604.98
doesn't make any structural logical

601.86 --> 610.5
sense there's just no way to justify

604.98 --> 615.51
that in any reasonable way and that's

610.5 --> 620.97
why I just it's too far and to stay then

615.51 --> 622.71
latch on to it it is psychotic and it

620.97 --> 625.44
makes me sick

622.71 --> 629.3100000000001
literally it's not because I hate him so

625.44 --> 631.32
much or because like how dare you test

629.31 --> 635.4599999999999
something no it is because of the way he

631.32 --> 639.72
does it it doesn't seem to be a

635.46 --> 642.63
reasonable approach it seems to be a

639.72 --> 645.72
disruptive destructive approach the

642.63 --> 649.1899999999999
indoctrination a replacement they get it

645.72 --> 652.65
out of the way without any sense

649.19 --> 655.72
sensibility behind it and yeah

652.65 --> 655.72
[Music]

660.13 --> 665.77
I'm obviously not the only one that's

662.72 --> 669.6800000000001
getting kind of sick of this [ __ ]

665.77 --> 672.17
because yeah like his presence it's

669.68 --> 674.66
starting to bring the John out in me

672.17 --> 677.4699999999999
okay and when that's going on you know

674.66 --> 681.28
things are really wrong if I'm gonna get

677.47 --> 685.46
tendencies to get all John on somebody

681.28 --> 687.4
because he does that and on the wind so

685.46 --> 690.73
he was holding him back pretty well

687.4 --> 693.38
surprisingly but maybe he was just

690.73 --> 695.8100000000001
taking a strategy of letting him dig his

693.38 --> 699.5
own grave I just couldn't stand to be in

695.81 --> 704.7099999999999
the presence of this so I got really

699.5 --> 704.71
pissed off and complaining

715.37 --> 723.17
gasps raise up from the earth well it's

719.35 --> 726.89
it basically comes into being it's yeah

723.17 --> 731.7199999999999
it's chemically transformed and then

726.89 --> 740.8389999999999
these gases are released in the open and

731.72 --> 744.74
then they mingle with the rest depending

740.839 --> 747.71
on their density did ya they may try to

744.74 --> 750.8
find a circuit a certain relative

747.71 --> 753.98
density equilibrium point but there's

750.8 --> 756.74
also a chance that it'll just dissolve

753.98 --> 761.24
in the rest of the air and then it would

756.74 --> 763.7
yeah when that happens other things

761.24 --> 766.25
happen it it's it no longer completely

763.7 --> 768.5
abides by the relative density rules at

766.25 --> 771.79
that point that's a weird thing about

768.5 --> 771.79
things dissolving

780.5 --> 785.44
right well Earth releases gas all the

782.96 --> 788.6800000000001
time there is even ecosystems

785.44 --> 793.1600000000001
surrounding this okay it's well

788.68 --> 797.4799999999999
well-documented just go watch the deep

793.16 --> 799.6999999999999
sea ocean movies there's just movies you

797.48 --> 801.44
can even see them on Netflix they're

799.7 --> 804.23
even forward it's all about climate

801.44 --> 806.09
change of course at some points and it's

804.23 --> 807.65
inevitable because it's a modern

806.09 --> 810.0500000000001
documentary and they always put that

807.65 --> 812.9
[ __ ] in there what's still extremely

810.05 --> 815.3
interesting and I saw I happen to have I

812.9 --> 817.31
happen to see it again last time I think

815.3 --> 819.8299999999999
it's because I was just looking around

817.31 --> 821.81
on the TV to see what's going on I do

819.83 --> 822.83
that sometimes I don't really try to

821.81 --> 825.41
make a habit out of it

822.83 --> 827.8100000000001
and it was on and I just like oh yeah

825.41 --> 830.03
beautiful footage I want to see that

827.81 --> 833.3299999999999
just I got hooked by the footage I

830.03 --> 835.5799999999999
really love like deep ocean footage

833.33 --> 838.73
things in nature I just love that [ __ ] I

835.58 --> 843.01
can't help it so I tried you know what

838.73 --> 843.01
they say unless it's just informative

843.94 --> 849.5600000000001
but yeah they addressed that there are

846.86 --> 853.49
places where there's just there's some

849.56 --> 855.8
volcanic deep activity likely and

853.49 --> 858.46
there's methane tubes where it just

855.8 --> 862.7199999999999
constantly relates releases methane and

858.46 --> 865.61
that's just entire ecosystems built up

862.72 --> 867.32
surrounding yeah that the trajectory of

865.61 --> 869.57
the methane release they're just

867.32 --> 873.6500000000001
basically building a city or surrounding

869.57 --> 875.84
it of coral and all kinds of things sort

873.65 --> 878.5699999999999
of coral it's slightly different it all

875.84 --> 881.63
has to be methane resistant there's also

878.57 --> 884.6
high heat issues it's very it's a weird

881.63 --> 888.13
ecology and there are certain bacteria

884.6 --> 891.74
apparently that that consume the methane

888.13 --> 895.7
almost like engines and then everything

891.74 --> 899.21
else are basically farming those

895.7 --> 901.5500000000001
bacteria and that is the tube city

899.21 --> 904.87
ecology it's pretty amazing but yeah

901.55 --> 908.68
there's natural gas release all the time

904.87 --> 908.68
definitely measurable

911.93 --> 919.1099999999999
so gas builds up it makes us in it yeah

917.069 --> 922.4699999999999
it burns up when if they look every time

919.11 --> 924.509
something is burned it basically

922.47 --> 930.12
transforms piece

924.509 --> 933.66
yeah gas into it by yeah it binds the

930.12 --> 937.079
oxygen gas in the air which literally

933.66 --> 939.569
takes its volume away it's it's pressure

937.079 --> 942.75
for Yuma takes it away and transforms it

939.569 --> 946.41
into a yeah solid piece of matter ashes

942.75 --> 951.769
or yeah usually gonna be bound in some

946.41 --> 951.769
kind of charcoal what is it

952.61 --> 958.5600000000001
well fire but that's what happens so

956.04 --> 962.87
yeah gases exchanged some are released

958.56 --> 970.3499999999999
some some are basically solidified again

962.87 --> 976.92
and it just goes around around and I do

970.35 --> 981.1800000000001
wonder sometimes if it is if potentially

976.92 --> 987.93
the entire pressure in the earth realm

981.18 --> 992.1289999999999
could be downed or upped by releasing

987.93 --> 995.3389999999999
gas I wonder if if that is possible or

992.129 --> 998.189
how much gas yeah you would even need to

995.339 --> 1000.5290000000001
release now you'd have to know the exact

998.189 --> 1003.98
volume of the container to size that the

1000.529 --> 1009.279
up the amount in order to even cause any

1003.98 --> 1009.279
kind of differential but I do wonder

1014.529 --> 1020.079
because yeah for example container wise

1017.799 --> 1023.049
you know and now I'm going to go way

1020.079 --> 1026.35
outside of conventional dome type

1023.049 --> 1030.339
thinking so what if there is well again

1026.35 --> 1033.549
I guess a looping realm but it could be

1030.339 --> 1036.97
potentially flexible so maybe there

1033.549 --> 1042.97
could be more room up there if there is

1036.97 --> 1045.699
more gas it'd be like a cell that will

1042.97 --> 1048.659
be growing but yeah it could also be

1045.699 --> 1056.6200000000001
contracting again maybe it's like that I

1048.659 --> 1060.24
yeah it's kind of a weird thought yeah

1056.62 --> 1064.09
we really don't have a full picture of

1060.24 --> 1067.929
of what the realm is like container wise

1064.09 --> 1070.389
it's just it's pretty certain it pretty

1067.929 --> 1074.409
it is absolutely certain that the realm

1070.389 --> 1077.4699999999998
is contained in some way and as to the

1074.409 --> 1080.5590000000002
vastness of the entire container

1077.47 --> 1084.1290000000001
I have no certainty I have no certainty

1080.559 --> 1087.759
if relative density or as they presume

1084.129 --> 1090.9089999999999
gravity functions and all points we take

1087.759 --> 1093.07
this for granted does it or does it work

1090.909 --> 1099.0900000000001
slightly differently at some point what

1093.07 --> 1102.279
like what is really out there you know

1099.09 --> 1103.869
we don't know from what we've gathered

1102.279 --> 1106.269
so far they're trying to trick us to

1103.869 --> 1108.759
believe there's an orbit system and all

1106.269 --> 1112.57
that in the outer space or outside of

1108.759 --> 1117.669
the normal gravity influence of the

1112.57 --> 1119.86
earth ball but yeah we assume that

1117.669 --> 1123.159
that's all trickery and that'll just go

1119.86 --> 1126.1899999999998
down but who knows how it really does

1123.159 --> 1129.25
work and if they could potentially it in

1126.19 --> 1135.0900000000001
some way reach a point where things

1129.25 --> 1135.09
would just kind of float who knows

1139.2 --> 1142.1000000000001
I don't know

1142.499 --> 1150.699
I'm trying to still keep an open mind as

1145.389 --> 1153.309
to what is up there but in all that

1150.699 --> 1156.3390000000002
openness of that of my mind of where I

1153.309 --> 1160.689
go with that there is no place where

1156.339 --> 1164.4389999999999
there is an actual vacuum basically the

1160.689 --> 1167.019
only way only place that in the open in

1164.439 --> 1172.509
the open there is no vacuum just there

1167.019 --> 1175.049
is none can't be I can only artificially

1172.509 --> 1175.049
create it

1187.25 --> 1192.039
hmm oh that's interesting Lee

1194.88 --> 1199.41
fascinating yep who knows

1213.1 --> 1222.809
right yep no peanuts Clark it is a very

1218.83 --> 1226.6299999999999
healthy attitude to accept that it's

1222.809 --> 1230.3799999999999
that it's very unlikely that we will

1226.63 --> 1233.74
ever find out but there is no guarantee

1230.38 --> 1235.929
that we could never find out there's no

1233.74 --> 1237.97
guarantee that it hasn't been found out

1235.929 --> 1243.429
and they simply don't want to share it

1237.97 --> 1246.3700000000001
with us you know did yeah that's the

1243.429 --> 1248.799
thing about complex conspiracies when

1246.37 --> 1251.1999999999998
they are already complex things could be

1248.799 --> 1252.82
always a little bit more complex there

1251.2 --> 1255.549
will be just too much for the average

1252.82 --> 1258.789
person to grasp grasp they'd get lost

1255.549 --> 1262.36
they lose over sight complexity is also

1258.789 --> 1264.669
a camouflaging method where you're

1262.36 --> 1265.379
trying to be sneaky and trying to fool

1264.669 --> 1270.1490000000001
people

1265.379 --> 1273.009
so who know maybe they do have a secret

1270.149 --> 1274.9289999999999
space program that's not actually a

1273.009 --> 1279.279
space program but a super high

1274.929 --> 1283.179
stratosphere of Stratus plane X high

1279.279 --> 1285.279
error exploration type thing maybe they

1283.179 --> 1287.799
have that going maybe it's not even

1285.279 --> 1291.309
related to normal astronaut this might

1287.799 --> 1294.759
just be a like a secret top secret pilot

1291.309 --> 1297.73
project for example that's only in the

1294.759 --> 1299.95
hands of those in any clique of people

1297.73 --> 1304.83
on that level who knows I don't know

1299.95 --> 1308.769
this is pure speculation but they could

1304.83 --> 1313.24
cuz we don't know for sure what's up

1308.769 --> 1318.269
there I don't hear the Bible telling me

1313.24 --> 1326.259
anywhere up there that you'll be choking

1318.269 --> 1330.8700000000001
you know doesn't talk about that so who

1326.259 --> 1335.919
knows maybe there is some kind of door

1330.87 --> 1338.1689999999999
though the heavens or yes we don't know

1335.919 --> 1341.95
until we actually get there maybe they

1338.169 --> 1345.26
got there maybe they're just fooling

1341.95 --> 1348.679
around with the lockdown control system

1345.26 --> 1351.89
where there's like a little sign that

1348.679 --> 1356.7800000000002
says yeah god is away on break be back

1351.89 --> 1364.0700000000002
in in 11 years you know maybe maybe

1356.78 --> 1367.6689999999999
that's going on would explain the the

1364.07 --> 1370.8799999999999
yeah the some weird phenomena going on

1367.669 --> 1372.98
maybe that the testing seems like a lot

1370.88 --> 1374.75
of the weird celestial phenomena they're

1372.98 --> 1378.799
curious like the blinking of the Sun

1374.75 --> 1381.02
could be some kind of testing so who

1378.799 --> 1383.71
knows yeah this seems pretty weird

1381.02 --> 1386.48
remote that idea right how I went there

1383.71 --> 1390.14
but then suddenly you look at it like

1386.48 --> 1392.48
okay there is a mechanism they are at

1390.14 --> 1395.8700000000001
the controls how did they get there what

1392.48 --> 1399.53
is that is it something people built

1395.87 --> 1401.559
from scratch new technology or is it

1399.53 --> 1404.33
something that was always there

1401.559 --> 1406.85
it's just they had the high office of

1404.33 --> 1410.33
this realm maybe that's it

1406.85 --> 1412.85
who knows maybe that's what it's in what

1410.33 --> 1416.09
is in Antarctica it's just the high

1412.85 --> 1416.86
office the interface for the weather and

1416.09 --> 1420.26
everything

1416.86 --> 1423.79
maybe it's it's all terraria tech maybe

1420.26 --> 1423.79
they built it who knows

1425.17 --> 1429.0790000000002

right by the way thanks Liam for the

1799.27 --> 1806.35
tips I already took a shower that kind

1803.62 --> 1808.84
of helps but it's just gonna I'm gonna

1806.35 --> 1812.4099999999999
be hot despite it all because especially

1808.84 --> 1814.6
because I yeah I drank some some alcohol

1812.41 --> 1816.0400000000002
yesterday so that's just dill the

1814.6 --> 1819.8799999999999
remnants of that are still working

1816.04 --> 1824.35
through and that's not helping against

1819.88 --> 1826.68
the experience of the heat so but yeah

1824.35 --> 1839.4399999999998
that's it's pretty much gonna be gone in

1826.68 --> 1845.0800000000002
like a few hours so I'll be ok so yeah

1839.44 --> 1851.14
Jason your regular account is unblocked

1845.08 --> 1854.79
so if you wanna be in my chat you can

1851.14 --> 1854.7900000000002
just get back on that one Oh

1859.0 --> 1869.53
ah yeah Jack Daniels hard liquor no I

1865.54 --> 1872.98
don't touch anything like that I'm never

1869.53 --> 1878.62
gonna go alcohol-wise outside of wine or

1872.98 --> 1885.06
beer Organic specifically because just

1878.62 --> 1888.6699999999998
not good for me it's new food like that

1885.06 --> 1893.44
the amount of punishment my body gets

1888.67 --> 1895.89
from the actual interestingness of the

1893.44 --> 1898.9
experience it's not worth it to me

1895.89 --> 1901.75
absolutely not because I have a lot of

1898.9 --> 1903.76
fun with beer and can have a lot of fun

1901.75 --> 1906.85
with wine as well it's definitely an

1903.76 --> 1910.89
experience to me and I don't feel

1906.85 --> 1914.05
absolutely horrible the next day and

1910.89 --> 1918.7800000000002
every time I add some kind of hard

1914.05 --> 1922.1499999999999
liquor gets involved it's always that

1918.78 --> 1924.69
yeah some occasion I might go might go

1922.15 --> 1927.1000000000001
specifically crazy for some reason and

1924.69 --> 1932.5
just say like oh yeah we're gonna hit

1927.1 --> 1934.9299999999998
that but I'll never make a habit I will

1932.5 --> 1937.24
yeah it'll just be out of stubbornness

1934.93 --> 1940.99
mostly because yeah the next day it's

1937.24 --> 1943.26
always really shitty especially if it's

1940.99 --> 1943.26
summer

1950.98 --> 1962.24
Brenden cook stop nagging about care and

1954.5 --> 1965.33
be okay look nobody cares about your

1962.24 --> 1970.27
opinion of her okay why don't you stop

1965.33 --> 1970.27
bothering her about that please

1980.35 --> 1987.4399999999998
right yeah well I'm a I'm an extreme

1985.519 --> 1990.309
lightweight venit when alcohol is

1987.44 --> 1990.309
concerned as well

1995.74 --> 2002.58
it's because I'm well I don't have a

1999.52 --> 2005.78
huge amount of body weight and I just

2002.58 --> 2010.1599999999999
happened to be kind of sensitive to it

2005.78 --> 2013.35
but it's also kind of useful because I

2010.16 --> 2017.91
think it's probably technically

2013.35 --> 2020.6999999999998
impossible for me to to drink myself to

2017.91 --> 2025.64
death for example by accident or even if

2020.7 --> 2028.71
I wanted to because my body would just

2025.64 --> 2031.41
shut it down before I could ever get

2028.71 --> 2034.6200000000001
there but look there's people that get

2031.41 --> 2037.3500000000001
go like ballistic and don't ever do this

2034.62 --> 2039.33
just don't do it it's it's a form of

2037.35 --> 2041.3999999999999
self-destructive mania just never do

2039.33 --> 2043.08
that they got on alcohol rage and then

2041.4 --> 2045.93
they literally start chugging hard

2043.08 --> 2047.97
liquor or something and like yeah [ __ ]

2045.93 --> 2051.66
me [ __ ] the world I'm just gonna drink

2047.97 --> 2053.58
until I drop dead and sometimes that can

2051.66 --> 2055.3399999999997
happen you can have serious alcohol

2053.58 --> 2060.72
poisoning if you don't get to a hospital

2055.34 --> 2061.2000000000003
right away you can die but I couldn't do

2060.72 --> 2063.2999999999997
that

2061.2 --> 2064.97
even if I were if I was like in a mood

2063.3 --> 2067.9500000000003
like that and thank God that I'm not

2064.97 --> 2071.6699999999996
because before I got like halfway the

2067.95 --> 2074.31
bottle my organs especially my stomach

2071.67 --> 2078.7200000000003
would just immediately start like

2074.31 --> 2082.11
exploding in like a panic fit and I'd be

2078.72 --> 2084.72
puking it out instantly like so hard

2082.11 --> 2087.81
it's like I yeah I'll get some of that

2084.72 --> 2090.06
pretty badly I'll get messed up but I

2087.81 --> 2091.7
could never really get lethal alcohol

2090.06 --> 2095.5499999999997
poisoning because my body just

2091.7 --> 2106.7999999999997
immediately ejects it it's like no don't

2095.55 --> 2111.9
and that's kinda handy in a way but that

2106.8 --> 2115.1400000000003
happened to me and look back in the day

2111.9 --> 2119.04
when I was a younger kid like in my late

2115.14 --> 2121.3799999999997
teens I would get pretty nutty with with

2119.04 --> 2124.71
alcohol and at parties and yeah smoking

2121.38 --> 2127.1
already do that combined and I had times

2124.71 --> 2129.18
where I just went so far and then weird

2127.1 --> 2131.04
experiences popped up

2129.18 --> 2133.3489999999997
potentially hallucinations or just

2131.04 --> 2136.92
confrontation with secret freaky

2133.349 --> 2141.03
behavior that I couldn't handle and that

2136.92 --> 2143.19
all combined the next day like suddenly

2141.03 --> 2145.44
I got sick like really sick because I

2143.19 --> 2148.079
was basically suppressing at all

2145.44 --> 2152.21
also suppressing the negative influence

2148.079 --> 2156.1400000000003
of the alcohol the like go through it I

2152.21 --> 2159.75
don't do that anymore like I have no

2156.14 --> 2163.6189999999997
focus need for me to actually get into

2159.75 --> 2167.369
the alcohol like that this is I just

2163.619 --> 2169.319
don't do that I don't need that I just

2167.369 --> 2171.51
need a few drinks and I'll be freaking

2169.319 --> 2174.27
happy and I'm just glad that I don't

2171.51 --> 2178.3190000000004
feel pushed around that I don't push

2174.27 --> 2180.78
around myself to drink more because back

2178.319 --> 2182.94
in the day when I did that sometimes it

2180.78 --> 2186.809
would go so terribly wrong I'd end up

2182.94 --> 2187.41
literally this sounds terrible but it's

2186.809 --> 2191.2200000000003
the truth

2187.41 --> 2193.74
vomiting all day non-stop and I wouldn't

2191.22 --> 2196.0099999999998
be vomiting up anything but that would

2193.74 --> 2199.5299999999997
still keep on going it's pretty horrific

2196.01 --> 2203.73
experience and it's like your entire

2199.53 --> 2206.4900000000002
system is being torn apart and at some

2203.73 --> 2208.619
point you literally start fearing that

2206.49 --> 2212.2799999999997
it could go bleeding or something and

2208.619 --> 2214.8900000000003
that thankfully that never happened but

2212.28 --> 2217.1090000000004
the the one time that it got really

2214.89 --> 2219.569
really bad which was the first time I

2217.109 --> 2221.609
did go to a hospital they actually

2219.569 --> 2225.569
checked out my stomach with a camera and

2221.609 --> 2230.67
I did actually have bruises in my

2225.569 --> 2234.869
stomach from from that yeah so that's

2230.67 --> 2237.359
what happens that's where you should

2234.869 --> 2240.4700000000003
smoke weed well I did it it's not

2237.359 --> 2244.44
exactly helping look if you get bad

2240.47 --> 2247.0789999999997
especially mixing up alcohols in a bad

2244.44 --> 2249.869
atmosphere [ __ ] that's not good it's

2247.079 --> 2252.6600000000003
never good but if you then also smoke

2249.869 --> 2258.599
weed that actually opens up your sense

2252.66 --> 2261.24
is more basically disable some of those

2258.599 --> 2262.799
natural defenses against outside

2261.24 --> 2271.41
influences that worsen

2262.799 --> 2273.42
at all so yeah cannabis can be a lot of

2271.41 --> 2281.279
fun but it can also make a bad situation

2273.42 --> 2285.179
worse and weed does not cause

2281.279 --> 2289.529
schizophrenia that's ridiculous you have

2285.179 --> 2292.109
no proof of that what it does do however

2289.529 --> 2295.65
is people that have natural

2292.109 --> 2299.5989999999997
psychological tendencies skits or

2295.65 --> 2303.63
schizoid elements in their personality

2299.599 --> 2310.799
then cannabis can definitely aggravate

2303.63 --> 2314.13
that and push that behavior almost like

2310.799 --> 2318.779
a neurosis it can do that but it doesn't

2314.13 --> 2321.239
cause it nobody that doesn't have

2318.779 --> 2323.4
schizophrenia in the slightest smokes

2321.239 --> 2326.099
weed and that has schizophrenia that's

2323.4 --> 2331.289
ridiculous it's absolutely not true so

2326.099 --> 2333.7490000000003
that's a lie what cannabis can aggravate

2331.289 --> 2336.239
things if you're not dealing with it

2333.749 --> 2339.089
properly what it does what it overall

2336.239 --> 2340.729
does cannabis and the literal experience

2339.089 --> 2342.799
influence that people have

2340.729 --> 2346.019
differentiates with a lot of people

2342.799 --> 2348.209
everybody has their own special angle to

2346.019 --> 2350.1299999999997
it how they experience it and it can

2348.209 --> 2354.239
even change over the years but what it

2350.13 --> 2359.67
does first of foremost is it confronts

2354.239 --> 2362.179
you with yourself what you got hidden on

2359.67 --> 2365.819
the inside what you're not looking at

2362.179 --> 2370.619
it's yeah that's what it does every

2365.819 --> 2373.41
single time and if you then are gonna

2370.619 --> 2377.7290000000003
make a habit of trying to ignore that

2373.41 --> 2379.5589999999997
and bypass it and sit in the experience

2377.729 --> 2382.14
itself but ignoring the actual

2379.559 --> 2385.489
confrontation that's going on that's

2382.14 --> 2385.489
when you're going to get in big trouble

2385.519 --> 2390.299
because then you literally become

2388.019 --> 2392.459
susceptible to spiritual negative

2390.299 --> 2394.65
influences because yeah you're still

2392.459 --> 2395.96
going to be opened up in some way even

2394.65 --> 2398.839
though you are

2395.96 --> 2401.06
using yourself off but it's a conscious

2398.839 --> 2405.64
thing that that's happening a conscious

2401.06 --> 2405.64
closed-off putting it away

2422.45 --> 2430.41
gleam I look I have no idea about

2425.009 --> 2433.92
Amsterdam I think it's a it's a big city

2430.41 --> 2436.5589999999997
it's always been a big city there's

2433.92 --> 2440.009
always been some crime there but I have

2436.559 --> 2441.96
no overview as to the level of crime and

2440.009 --> 2445.819
how it's potentially going up or down

2441.96 --> 2449.279
and the exacts measures that are taken I

2445.819 --> 2452.91
don't know the specific situation in

2449.279 --> 2455.339
Amsterdam I don't know if it has gotten

2452.91 --> 2459.39
worse or if it's just same old same old

2455.339 --> 2461.49
I don't know what I am more familiar

2459.39 --> 2466.5
with is what I am confronted with here

2461.49 --> 2469.3689999999997
in Utrecht and yeah there's a lot of

2466.5 --> 2473.7
police around and there seem to be

2469.369 --> 2479.19
criminal activity but mostly just

2473.7 --> 2481.609
sneaking around and drug dealing that

2479.19 --> 2485.369
kind of thing that's that seems to be

2481.609 --> 2492.569
like pretty prevalent here but actual

2485.369 --> 2495.509
violence no no rarely there are some

2492.569 --> 2501.089
like misbehavior here and there but not

2495.509 --> 2508.17
not like really horrific levels so I

2501.089 --> 2510.99
don't know but yeah then again this is

2508.17 --> 2512.789
not a a really a bad neighbor but there

2510.99 --> 2516.2099999999996
are some neighborhoods where there's

2512.789 --> 2518.3900000000003
just like more [ __ ] going on or it's

2516.21 --> 2518.39
worse

2522.01 --> 2532.9300000000003
wait do I have Jason oh oh sorry guys I

2529.08 --> 2538.89
thought why wasn't I see oh he is there

2532.93 --> 2538.89
okay hello welcome back

2551.26 --> 2558.67
hmm Holland is a hotspot for all drugs

2554.92 --> 2560.9500000000003
in transit could be good could very well

2558.67 --> 2565.119
be I get the feeling that there's a lot

2560.95 --> 2571.77
of freelancing going on concerning drug

2565.119 --> 2571.77
trade through the through the dark web

2587.2 --> 2594.71
all right yeah clean I don't know

2591.7 --> 2602.7799999999997
look Inglot just seems to be in a

2594.71 --> 2604.61
slightly different situation for some

2602.78 --> 2606.71
reason I get the feeling with with

2604.61 --> 2611.33
England especially London that they're

2606.71 --> 2615.17
just literally letting it get out of

2611.33 --> 2617.0
hand on purpose because in the

2615.17 --> 2618.5
Netherlands I don't have the feeling

2617.0 --> 2622.25
they're doing that I think that in the

2618.5 --> 2624.41
Netherlands they are kind of like wake

2622.25 --> 2625.97
yeah how do you say they're still trying

2624.41 --> 2628.0699999999997
to be sneaky is still trying to be

2625.97 --> 2630.3199999999997
controllers and [ __ ] in politics it's

2628.07 --> 2634.34
always the same but at least they are

2630.32 --> 2636.53
kind of like handling the situation

2634.34 --> 2641.11
they're not literally like letting the

2636.53 --> 2643.0400000000004
migrants just trash everything up here

2641.11 --> 2647.69
that's the big difference between

2643.04 --> 2648.86
England and the Netherlands they didn't

2647.69 --> 2651.02
let it get that far

2648.86 --> 2654.6200000000003
they're like cooperating they're going

2651.02 --> 2656.42
with the plan but yeah sort of like a

2654.62 --> 2658.7
middle road thing like oh yeah yeah

2656.42 --> 2660.77
we're on your side yeah but yeah but

2658.7 --> 2664.1
we're not gonna do it like that because

2660.77 --> 2668.06
look look at Paris look at London no no

2664.1 --> 2670.0099999999998
thanks but yeah we are still on your

2668.06 --> 2672.95
side that that's kind of like the

2670.01 --> 2676.46
attitude of the Netherlands very typical

2672.95 --> 2679.21
very go along attitudes so Dutch so

2676.46 --> 2679.21
Dutch politics

2694.769 --> 2700.5389999999998
yeah but I have no problem if you guys

2698.47 --> 2705.0389999999998
have any opinions you'd like to share or

2700.539 --> 2707.44
pieces of data concerning that if you've

2705.039 --> 2711.5190000000002
been digging into the details then by

2707.44 --> 2716.289
all means please share the data if you

2711.519 --> 2719.3489999999997
have found some interesting data because

2716.289 --> 2722.099
yeah with this for me it is still a lot

2719.349 --> 2725.049
of just wet finger work at this point

2722.099 --> 2732.15
although I think I do get a decent

2725.049 --> 2732.15
oversight despite just the wet fingering

2741.7 --> 2750.72
all right yeah in America it's like a

2745.359 --> 2756.8089999999997
special case it's really weird because

2750.72 --> 2762.04
look concerning immigration America

2756.809 --> 2764.2000000000003
before this century basically before

2762.04 --> 2765.15
what is going on now yeah now it's like

2764.2 --> 2767.3799999999997
crazy

2765.15 --> 2769.1800000000003
unconditional open borders that's like

2767.38 --> 2773.6400000000003
what they're trying and there is seem

2769.18 --> 2777.21
that does seem to be a sponsored

2773.64 --> 2781.9
migration invasion it's it's insane and

2777.21 --> 2784.51
it's very towards the United States very

2781.9 --> 2789.2200000000003
pushy but the United States has always

2784.51 --> 2792.309
been and this is just true a nation of

2789.22 --> 2796.72
immigrants legal immigrants though

2792.309 --> 2799.42
mostly and so that is normal that people

2796.72 --> 2805.2
migrate there but this is just different

2799.42 --> 2809.2000000000003
this is a caravan that's basically been

2805.2 --> 2812.859
or a caravan just a horde of people that

2809.2 --> 2815.73
are not conditioned to basically adapt

2812.859 --> 2820.0589999999997
to America and become a part of it and

2815.73 --> 2822.96
enjoy its fruits and get sneak and

2820.059 --> 2826.059
sneakily tricked into scams and [ __ ] as

2822.96 --> 2828.67
everyone else know these are people that

2826.059 --> 2833.1090000000004
are specifically there to basically try

2828.67 --> 2835.75
to take over or the real [ __ ] and not

2833.109 --> 2838.119
even because they are naturally evil and

2835.75 --> 2840.04
some of them may be but also because

2838.119 --> 2843.9100000000003
that's kind of like the plan it's

2840.04 --> 2847.29
literally handed to them like yeah this

2843.91 --> 2850.66
is yeah you're taking over America

2847.29 --> 2852.97
you're the new owners that that's

2850.66 --> 2854.3489999999997
roughly the message that a lot of these

2852.97 --> 2856.66
people are getting when they are

2854.349 --> 2860.849
basically sent to America that's crazy

2856.66 --> 2866.49
and in Europe that's extremely unusual

2860.849 --> 2869.349
never happens like that but in America

2866.49 --> 2872.04
yeah they're used to migration but not

2869.349 --> 2872.04
like this

2873.17 --> 2879.619
it's so weird how that works it it's

2876.44 --> 2881.71
just not even normal migration look who

2879.619 --> 2883.9100000000003
has a problem with people legally

2881.71 --> 2885.92
migrating to their country and just

2883.91 --> 2890.21
becoming a part of their society and

2885.92 --> 2891.92
blood income economy you know good

2890.21 --> 2896.029
citizen who has a problem with that

2891.92 --> 2898.88
really in this age but that's not the

2896.029 --> 2901.039
issue if the issue is is just huge

2898.88 --> 2904.779
amounts of people that are being drummed

2901.039 --> 2907.9100000000003
up like some kind of foreign secret army

2904.779 --> 2913.43
that are trying to that are being pushed

2907.91 --> 2915.98
in thanks to a corporate conspiracy in

2913.43 --> 2918.23
order to kind of disrupt the place and

2915.98 --> 2928.64
take over and that is just not normal

2918.23 --> 2932.539
migration it's a corporate conspiracy to

2928.64 --> 2935.3289999999997
take over by supplanting the crops

2932.539 --> 2936.65
they're harvesting that's kind of what

2935.329 --> 2941.329
they're trying to do they're trying to

2936.65 --> 2944.809
supplant the crops they're using that's

2941.329 --> 2946.369
our corporations yeah when it comes down

2944.809 --> 2948.259
to the big ones treat human beings

2946.369 --> 2950.6600000000003
they're treating like crops you can

2948.259 --> 2953.72
harvest and you can get money and labor

2950.66 --> 2955.8799999999997
how tough and they want new crops that

2953.72 --> 2959.24
are more easily conditioned it'll work

2955.88 --> 2962.539
for less all that so they're trying

2959.24 --> 2965.359
yeah they plan a sneaky hostile take

2962.539 --> 2970.9100000000003
over by weaponizing migration to

2965.359 --> 2973.339
supplant the crops it's ridiculous well

2970.91 --> 2977.269
Paula horse teeth I tried to be a good

2973.339 --> 2984.759
citizen sounds kind of silly but yeah I

2977.269 --> 2988.64
I can't help it I you know I'm not a

2984.759 --> 2991.759
outstanding working citizen not like

2988.64 --> 2994.339
that and but I do have like a conscious

2991.759 --> 2997.9900000000002
about it's not like I say yeah who needs

2994.339 --> 3002.019
a job don't go to work no of course not

2997.99 --> 3003.7299999999996
there's there are some advantages to not

3002.019 --> 3005.589
working but there's also a lot of

3003.73 --> 3006.64
disadvantages and I think with most

3005.589 --> 3011.56
people that couldn't

3006.64 --> 3014.02
even work with me it barely works but

3011.56 --> 3017.68
it's just my life went in a very weird

3014.02 --> 3021.73
way and some obstacles I just never

3017.68 --> 3025.66
managed to really overcome and I just

3021.73 --> 3029.41
I'm figuring out another routes and I do

3025.66 --> 3034.0
like doing constructive things I do

3029.41 --> 3037.39
tasks typically am like the guy that

3034.0 --> 3039.37
cleans up when other people are just

3037.39 --> 3041.02
thinking yeah they just don't like it

3039.37 --> 3042.94
and they just ignore it and they're

3041.02 --> 3044.38
being irresponsible in my opinion and

3042.94 --> 3046.42
I'm the guy that's gonna clean that up

3044.38 --> 3050.1600000000003
because I don't want to look at that

3046.42 --> 3053.7400000000002
[ __ ] I'm the one that's actually

3050.16 --> 3055.99
collecting glass and paper here from all

3053.74 --> 3058.6
the roommates and then I'm the one

3055.99 --> 3062.77
bringing it to recycling because they

3058.6 --> 3064.63
never do that because yeah there's

3062.77 --> 3066.49
nobody's forcing them to do that and

3064.63 --> 3069.4900000000002
they don't give a [ __ ] really although

3066.49 --> 3071.6499999999996
it's like a game habit and so that's why

3069.49 --> 3073.33
they still do it but they're not gonna

3071.65 --> 3076.6600000000003
actually put in effort to bring it away

3073.33 --> 3078.88
I do that when I go to the coffee shop

3076.66 --> 3083.41
and I roll a joint and I enjoy it in the

3078.88 --> 3086.11
park I always clean up [ __ ] not literal

3083.41 --> 3088.3799999999997
[ __ ] I don't clean that up thank god

3086.11 --> 3091.0
there's not a lot of poo laying around

3088.38 --> 3097.27
but like junk

3091.0 --> 3100.6
stupid cans or bottles crap there's like

3097.27 --> 3102.7
people that they just refuse to use the

3100.6 --> 3106.3199999999997
freaking garbage can that's right there

3102.7 --> 3108.7
so I always end up then being the guy

3106.32 --> 3112.84
tidying it up again cleaning it up

3108.7 --> 3115.5699999999997
because yeah it's good to do I like it

3112.84 --> 3117.4900000000002
better afterwards and I feel a little

3115.57 --> 3122.65
bit good about myself win-win for

3117.49 --> 3127.5
everyone so that's what I do in

3122.65 --> 3131.23
compensation as a habit for not having a

3127.5 --> 3133.72
solid working career as I just tried to

3131.23 --> 3136.33
do good things wherever I can especially

3133.72 --> 3138.9399999999996
things that nobody else likes to do or

3136.33 --> 3140.17
that isn't worth it like my freakin news

3138.94 --> 3142.85
paper round

3140.17 --> 3144.11
that I have to be careful not starting

3142.85 --> 3146.69
to complain about it all the time

3144.11 --> 3149.6
because I literally don't make [ __ ] off

3146.69 --> 3151.4900000000002
it and everyone knows it that's not why

3149.6 --> 3153.61
nobody's doing that job because it

3151.49 --> 3156.41
doesn't pay [ __ ] it's aimed at

3153.61 --> 3158.81
youngsters that don't want to do it

3156.41 --> 3161.99
because it doesn't pay anything they're

3158.81 --> 3164.15
just gonna go for a much realer job

3161.99 --> 3166.79
that's gonna pay out a lot more so

3164.15 --> 3169.61
nobody's doing it I'm doing it not to

3166.79 --> 3172.4
make money I'm doing it because the

3169.61 --> 3176.21
people that do get the papers are really

3172.4 --> 3187.79
happy about it that's really the only

3176.21 --> 3191.09
reason I do it and isn't that really

3187.79 --> 3195.65
what work is about it's about market

3191.09 --> 3199.4300000000003
it's about what's needed if it's only

3195.65 --> 3202.28
gonna be about money then there will

3199.43 --> 3205.7
eventually be things that are gonna be

3202.28 --> 3207.32
neglected because nobody wants to do

3205.7 --> 3209.5099999999998
anything about it

3207.32 --> 3212.27
could get to a point where people are

3209.51 --> 3214.4900000000002
gonna basically even potentially

3212.27 --> 3216.38
blackmail everyone over like yeah we can

3214.49 --> 3222.47
clean it up but you're gonna pay big

3216.38 --> 3226.7000000000003
time for it and things will get so bad

3222.47 --> 3230.1499999999996
that people just be forced gunpoint to

3226.7 --> 3233.6899999999996
eventually freakin pay for it to clean

3230.15 --> 3239.83
it up that kind of [ __ ] but I just try

3233.69 --> 3243.26
to do things that are necessary and that

3239.83 --> 3245.21
I like doing at the same time when

3243.26 --> 3246.5600000000004
nobody else likes doing it and to make a

3245.21 --> 3250.58
profession out of it

3246.56 --> 3253.94
really would totally ruin it and that is

3250.58 --> 3258.52
what I've noticed more widely as soon as

3253.94 --> 3264.4900000000002
I as soon as there's like a price on my

3258.52 --> 3264.49
work it kind of ruins it for me

3265.05 --> 3270.3100000000004
only thing where that doesn't really

3267.46 --> 3272.41
happen is is with goldsmithing but

3270.31 --> 3276.0099999999998
that's because yeah you need the

3272.41 --> 3277.8999999999996
resources so you're gonna take some

3276.01 --> 3281.5890000000004
money for that and then I take just take

3277.9 --> 3283.63
a very modest price and then I feel good

3281.589 --> 3289.9
about it especially if the project

3283.63 --> 3293.67
really succeeds which it usually did but

3289.9 --> 3293.67
I just yeah

3301.47 --> 3307.5299999999997
I don't know I think that's probably a

3304.859 --> 3311.9
lot of people in the United States think

3307.53 --> 3316.349
I'm like really an American because I

3311.9 --> 3319.44
don't do well with paid jobs and I'm

3316.349 --> 3324.96
just like doing [ __ ] for free

3319.44 --> 3328.5
to help out and yeah there's people

3324.96 --> 3331.52
sometimes literally like boggled looking

3328.5 --> 3333.329
at me like why aren't you trying to

3331.52 --> 3335.31
profit from this

3333.329 --> 3338.819
why aren't you extorting money from

3335.31 --> 3339.42
people making them feel guilty for doing

3338.819 --> 3344.54
that

3339.42 --> 3344.54
so yeah they will hand over money to you

3344.72 --> 3353.5499999999997
and I think okay hmm I could do that but

3350.94 --> 3355.17
that it kind of ruined the effect of it

3353.55 --> 3362.4300000000003
all wouldn't it because I feel like a

3355.17 --> 3364.05
total dick for doing that so so yeah

3362.43 --> 3366.21
it's like oh yeah I'm doing something

3364.05 --> 3367.71
good so I can be a dick to people about

3366.21 --> 3370.41
how good I was

3367.71 --> 3373.71
and basically guilt them out of their

3370.41 --> 3376.0099999999998
money no that's that doesn't really work

3373.71 --> 3376.01
for me

3380.54 --> 3391.07
yeah no Jonathan Doty I I don't think

3385.88 --> 3396.11
recycling is a scam I definitely do not

3391.07 --> 3402.38
think it is a scam but there are issues

3396.11 --> 3404.96
with it it's still in development stages

3402.38 --> 3408.98
there could be so much more done with

3404.96 --> 3414.19
recycling especially high-tech it's one

3408.98 --> 3416.51
of my great visions is like an a a true

3414.19 --> 3420.05
material transformer where you could

3416.51 --> 3424.1600000000003
just like insert junk in it and it would

3420.05 --> 3430.19
then by all means eject just rough

3424.16 --> 3433.3999999999996
molecular powder separated so you could

3430.19 --> 3436.07
basically get back raw materials out of

3433.4 --> 3439.94
junk I think that that is where that

3436.07 --> 3442.76
should end up recycling and yeah people

3439.94 --> 3446.18
are not there yet but by a long shot

3442.76 --> 3449.09
and it's being like semi corporatized

3446.18 --> 3452.27
and all that and but it's not a scam not

3449.09 --> 3455.63
really yeah people can make scams with

3452.27 --> 3457.7
recycling definitely okay nothing is in

3455.63 --> 3460.79
the corporate world is not susceptible

3457.7 --> 3465.49
to scams of some kind so a scammer is

3460.79 --> 3470.57
trying to screw something up but

3465.49 --> 3475.58
recycling overall is not a scam I don't

3470.57 --> 3478.9
think so and I think that even just as a

3475.58 --> 3483.5299999999997
mind concept as a concept recycling

3478.9 --> 3486.11
reusing collecting I think that's a good

3483.53 --> 3491.09
thing to do because it kind of helps

3486.11 --> 3494.96
focus the mind into that habit opposing

3491.09 --> 3498.92
just being [ __ ] consumers dropping

3494.96 --> 3502.16
[ __ ] wherever you go so if you if you

3498.92 --> 3504.26
are taught recycling you'll be less

3502.16 --> 3508.42
likely to end up becoming one of those

3504.26 --> 3508.42
idiots that just drop junk everywhere

3512.7 --> 3515.8199999999997
[Music]

3522.4 --> 3525.4
yeah

3526.36 --> 3529.559
[Music]

3531.85 --> 3537.61
yeah sorry but transport it's always

3535.27 --> 3541.36
gonna be exhausted that's really barely

3537.61 --> 3545.29
a problem recycling is not about

3541.36 --> 3550.48
reducing fuel consumption okay

3545.29 --> 3556.59
it's about recycling raw materials not

3550.48 --> 3559.15
about saving fuel it's about preventing

3556.59 --> 3562.2400000000002
escalation of junk buildup

3559.15 --> 3564.73
that's what recycling is for and to

3562.24 --> 3571.66
potentially just try to reuse materials

3564.73 --> 3573.52
as long as possible and at first yeah it

3571.66 --> 3576.43
will be like junk material that's

3573.52 --> 3579.79
useless but eventually the industry can

3576.43 --> 3582.6
actually find ways to adapt recycled

3579.79 --> 3586.33
material in actual real goods

3582.6 --> 3589.5899999999997
application and that's where recycling

3586.33 --> 3589.59
really becomes interesting

3593.77 --> 3604.03
ha China builds land with it well yeah

3600.46 --> 3607.5
curious I'll see where that goes

3604.03 --> 3607.5
what they're doing with it

3624.41 --> 3631.94
Yeah right daylight Ohio that's right

3627.42 --> 3635.91
yeah metals more metals is a market and

3631.94 --> 3637.86
our good friends Hagrid wells knows

3635.91 --> 3641.3599999999997
everything about it because he basically

3637.86 --> 3647.9700000000003
is a professional at at collecting

3641.36 --> 3654.3900000000003
metals to recycle so yeah but it's not

3647.97 --> 3658.4399999999996
about the profit it's about just

3654.39 --> 3668.66
reducing junk buildup and trying to find

3658.44 --> 3672.75
ya useful ways to reapply materials and

3668.66 --> 3675.45
yeah it yields mixed results but that's

3672.75 --> 3677.4
it's a testing process every time it's

3675.45 --> 3680.6699999999996
like okay we use something recycled is

3677.4 --> 3683.1
it kind of worth it and then the people

3680.67 --> 3683.76
kind of decide over time and yeah it'll

3683.1 --> 3686.7599999999998
be either

3683.76 --> 3688.4100000000003
okay we're sick of this freakin recycled

3686.76 --> 3690.3
junk we don't want that anymore because

3688.41 --> 3692.52
it's just crappy I know it's good for

3690.3 --> 3695.55
the environment it sucks or it's gonna

3692.52 --> 3697.32
be what oh it's recycled oh well I

3695.55 --> 3700.38
didn't know it works great you know

3697.32 --> 3704.67
that's the result the result is either

3700.38 --> 3708.03
it fails as a product or it doesn't so

3704.67 --> 3712.35
recycling techniques needs to and do

3708.03 --> 3714.86
improve themselves until it becomes

3712.35 --> 3714.86
worth it

3715.07 --> 3721.01
so recycling you know it really all

3718.02 --> 3723.03
depends on where it it where it goes

3721.01 --> 3728.21
what's going to be done with it

3723.03 --> 3728.21
and I'm very much for it

3734.76 --> 3742.65
you know it it's funny in my day in our

3740.13 --> 3746.21
Wednesday in the 80s when I was young

3742.65 --> 3750.6
kid we actually in school had recycling

3746.21 --> 3752.31
themed that there was a theme sometimes

3750.6 --> 3754.2
like okay yeah we're gonna teach you

3752.31 --> 3756.21
everything about recycling how you do it

3754.2 --> 3758.31
and then you go out with the kids and

3756.21 --> 3760.859
teachers and just try to find bottles

3758.31 --> 3762.6
and [ __ ] and research yeah that was like

3760.859 --> 3765.09
a thing that we did with was actually

3762.6 --> 3768.18
taught on school now there's something

3765.09 --> 3770.609
that's useful instead of all this freaky

3768.18 --> 3772.3199999999997
[ __ ] that's being taught right now that

3770.609 --> 3774.869
thing was useful that's a useful thing

3772.32 --> 3782.4900000000002
to teach kids they get good habits out

3774.869 --> 3786.03
of that so do that I went through it I

3782.49 --> 3789.6
thought it was good do that just let

3786.03 --> 3793.02
teach kids to freaking recycle to make a

3789.6 --> 3797.0099999999998
hobby out of it no and who knows maybe

3793.02 --> 3799.53
they'll end up just instead of gaming in

3797.01 --> 3803.01
their freakin mobile all day they'll end

3799.53 --> 3805.52
up actually recycling like yeah finding

3803.01 --> 3811.38
stuff and just being out there

3805.52 --> 3813.5099999999998
physically doing things and there's

3811.38 --> 3818.76
people that have done yes it's kind of

3813.51 --> 3822.21
funny because I know my ex mother that

3818.76 --> 3824.7200000000003
does that for a hobby and she that

3822.21 --> 3827.91
mother made a lot of money sometimes

3824.72 --> 3831.54
because it did that just every day as a

3827.91 --> 3833.94
habit and she found a lot of bottles and

3831.54 --> 3837.869
things that had recycling money on them

3833.94 --> 3840.4700000000003
and it's surprising how much you can

3837.869 --> 3840.4700000000003
make from that

3848.89 --> 3851.89
really

3852.25 --> 3859.98
you think I'm 70 and a half Jeffery bill

3863.609 --> 3873.2799999999997
right mm-hmm

3869.01 --> 3875.5
yeah mind for ya it's a thing that type

3873.28 --> 3879.73
of recycling it's a thing some places do

3875.5 --> 3881.17
have recycling on cans but here the

3879.73 --> 3886.3
Netherlands mostly like a typical

3881.17 --> 3889.96
plastic bottle and beer both glass beer

3886.3 --> 3890.8
bottle recycling situation that's pretty

3889.96 --> 3892.9900000000002
universal

3890.8 --> 3895.75
so like the same type of things every

3892.99 --> 3901.66
time and it's everywhere used in all

3895.75 --> 3904.39
kinds of products but as far as I'm

3901.66 --> 3908.2599999999998
concerned I am NOT a guy that's gonna be

3904.39 --> 3911.71
like oh yeah I'm gonna get money from

3908.26 --> 3913.75
that because again I don't care I have

3911.71 --> 3915.819
done that in the past it was kind of

3913.75 --> 3917.77
interesting it's funny when you do it

3915.819 --> 3921.13
with other people on my own that would

3917.77 --> 3925.54
be just I'd feel like a bum sound sounds

3921.13 --> 3928.03
bad but I don't wanna I don't wanna I

3925.54 --> 3929.89
just want to be a guy that's gonna come

3928.03 --> 3932.619
somewhere I say wow this place is

3929.89 --> 3934.569
beautiful except for all that junk that

3932.619 --> 3937.27
laying around don't need to make money

3934.569 --> 3939.55
from it I just don't want to look at

3937.27 --> 3941.849
that [ __ ] anymore so I'm gonna pick it

3939.55 --> 3945.3
up and put it in the nearest trash can

3941.849 --> 3945.3
that's what I do

3948.5 --> 3958.67
hmm but yeah I think that recycling is a

3953.21 --> 3960.89
good system and having money on specific

3958.67 --> 3964.73
items to encourage recycling is also a

3960.89 --> 3968.27
good system should be kept or at least

3964.73 --> 3970.369
tried like just try it out now it may

3968.27 --> 3973.55
depend per region there may be certain

3970.369 --> 3975.32
regions and wherever you are or just a

3973.55 --> 3977.349
lot of people just so happen to like

3975.32 --> 3981.17
doing that a lot and then it'll really

3977.349 --> 3985.4300000000003
hit if you get us recycling with fees

3981.17 --> 3987.59
for that ever it'll be cleaner than than

3985.43 --> 3989.5099999999998
anything else out there but the other

3987.59 --> 3991.73
four regions people just might not give

3989.51 --> 3992.7200000000003
a [ __ ] and just nobody's gonna do

3991.73 --> 3997.66
anything about it

3992.72 --> 4000.91
so it really depends on on the region

3997.66 --> 4004.45
gonna find the people that like doing it

4000.91 --> 4008.3689999999997
and you gotta basically give them

4004.45 --> 4012.1299999999997
something to do hmm

4008.369 --> 4014.98
anyway I'm gonna round out the show then

4012.13 --> 4017.8900000000003
go for six six minutes now so thanks
