they'll be much appreciated

80.88 --> 84.15899999999999
could still use it

84.88 --> 90.0
right so yeah the weather today is

88.24 --> 92.079
just

90.0 --> 94.88
astounding

92.079 --> 96.55999999999999
look at this there's not a cloud in the

94.88 --> 98.079
sky

96.56 --> 101.04
and

98.079 --> 102.72
planes aren't really leaving persistent

101.04 --> 106.24000000000001
trails even though there's plenty of

102.72 --> 106.24
planes in the sky right now

107.119 --> 111.36
but their trails don't remain

109.28 --> 113.52
and it's

111.36 --> 114.88
yeah it's not even all that hazy at the

113.52 --> 118.79899999999999
horizon

114.88 --> 122.479
this is just really crystal blue clear

118.799 --> 122.47900000000001
there's also a lot of wind

123.04 --> 127.43900000000001
and the wind is kind of cold

125.6 --> 130.07999999999998
yeah that's pretty much the reason why

127.439 --> 132.16
i'm wearing my sweater

130.08 --> 135.59900000000002
because it is

132.16 --> 135.599
still kind of cold out there

136.48 --> 141.2
especially when the wind is not hitting

138.64 --> 142.48
you but a beautiful day

141.2 --> 144.07999999999998
also

142.48 --> 147.67999999999998
i don't know if you can see that through

144.08 --> 150.08
the trees but there's already some trees

147.68 --> 153.76000000000002
having spring blossom so it's like the

150.08 --> 155.68
first spring blossoming trees

153.76 --> 157.84
and

155.68 --> 160.0
bushels

157.84 --> 160.959
are starting to bloom not everything yet

160.0 --> 163.84
the big

160.959 --> 166.31900000000002
tree over there usually blooms a little

163.84 --> 168.16
bit later

166.319 --> 172.56
but here and there in between there's

168.16 --> 172.56
already blossom it's really enjoyable

174.56 --> 177.519
i think though

179.92 --> 184.79999999999998
that i might be getting some spring

182.48 --> 185.84
allergies already from it though a

184.8 --> 188.72
little

185.84 --> 188.72
always get a little

189.519 --> 193.44
not too

191.28 --> 195.44
too allergic

193.44 --> 197.04
i've noticed that i'm just a little bit

195.44 --> 200.0
more snotty

197.04 --> 202.48
in the morning in the last week or so

200.0 --> 204.64
anyway hello

202.48 --> 206.79899999999998

204.64 --> 208.79899999999998

206.799 --> 212.04000000000002
elise g

208.799 --> 212.04000000000002
mike sedunich

213.76 --> 219.35999999999999
good to see you all

215.76 --> 222.35999999999999
it is saturday the 19th of march

219.36 --> 222.36
2022

222.56 --> 226.44
man our time is flying

227.68 --> 230.0
ah

232.239 --> 235.439
yeah

233.2 --> 237.35999999999999
start a little late because the guys on

235.439 --> 238.84
skype

237.36 --> 241.84
just had

238.84 --> 245.599
a a call with one another with me in

241.84 --> 248.0
there to just talk about internal things

245.599 --> 250.56
flat some other flat earth channel back

248.0 --> 250.56
and forths

252.879 --> 257.359
they're still talking but yeah i gotta

255.28 --> 259.759
start my show

257.359 --> 262.15999999999997
anyway

259.759 --> 263.44
hello george sanford

262.16 --> 266.639
just

263.44 --> 266.639
sun gazing okay

267.68 --> 269.84000000000003
fine

273.84 --> 277.75899999999996
i got some grapefruit juice

277.919 --> 281.88
and a green tea of course

285.28 --> 290.71999999999997
right so what do you guys think about my

287.84 --> 290.71999999999997
show yesterday

292.88 --> 297.199
i haven't watched it back

295.44 --> 300.08
but

297.199 --> 301.6
i still i'm i'm pretty sure i was just

300.08 --> 303.28
very focused

301.6 --> 304.96000000000004
most of it despite what i thought was

303.28 --> 307.28
gonna happen at the start because at the

304.96 --> 308.479
start i was kind of like whoa

307.28 --> 310.55999999999995
i don't know

308.479 --> 312.24
but then it just all like click click

310.56 --> 314.88
click

312.24 --> 318.0
really started to roll

314.88 --> 318.0
and was very fluid

319.759 --> 324.56
and yeah flat earth debates was also

322.08 --> 326.88
really enjoyable

324.56 --> 328.08
everybody was kind of fluid

326.88 --> 331.36
and

328.08 --> 332.88
yeah the after show also lasted

331.36 --> 336.40000000000003
a decent time

332.88 --> 340.479
not super like six more hours but still

336.4 --> 340.479
i think it was all together for our show

350.96 --> 356.23999999999995
trying to stare at the sun until god

354.08 --> 357.52
no yeah i have

356.24 --> 359.6
as a kid

357.52 --> 361.28
not doing that again

359.6 --> 365.40000000000003
it's not good

361.28 --> 365.4
it's like not good for your retina

373.12 --> 377.199
i just like facing the sun with my eyes

375.36 --> 380.08000000000004
closed

377.199 --> 382.40000000000003
like sheen up and then it it will still

380.08 --> 385.12
just shine through your closed eyes

382.4 --> 387.44
right but you don't have to like

385.12 --> 390.72
overburden your retinas it just i don't

387.44 --> 394.56
recommend that that i really don't

390.72 --> 396.639
it freaked you out yeah oh no [ __ ] maybe

394.56 --> 401.08
that's a sign like hey

396.639 --> 401.08
maybe you shouldn't be doing this

414.4 --> 420.71999999999997
dude george i don't know why you're

416.56 --> 420.72
doing that it's don't do that man

421.12 --> 428.72
like don't burn out your retinas

425.919 --> 432.28
yeah they'll regenerate but you can

428.72 --> 432.28000000000003
overdo it

436.4 --> 440.31899999999996
like if you're if you happen to be in a

438.8 --> 442.479
state

440.319 --> 444.08000000000004
where that regeneration is just not

442.479 --> 446.639
optimal you could literally give

444.08 --> 448.84
yourself serious blind spots that can be

446.639 --> 451.84000000000003
a hazard

448.84 --> 454.88
like if you have to be like on the road

451.84 --> 458.88
or something just don't do that

454.88 --> 460.319
i'm sorry but really don't do that

458.88 --> 462.88
i mean if you're still gonna do it

460.319 --> 464.8
somebody in chat fine but like

462.88 --> 467.599
that's not good

464.8 --> 471.44
it's not something i recommend

467.599 --> 473.919
just face the sun eyes closed it's good

471.44 --> 476.919
don't literally stare into it with open

473.919 --> 476.919
eyes

479.84 --> 482.84
anyway

496.319 --> 501.12
yeah yeah at least g yeah look the whole

501.44 --> 507.039
like the sun is even in their model a

504.08 --> 509.12
pretty mysterious bizarre thing it is

507.039 --> 511.12
quite surreal

509.12 --> 513.12
doesn't make a lot of sense

511.12 --> 515.839
but it has inspired a whole bunch of

513.12 --> 518.08
ideas about it like that claim for

515.839 --> 520.1590000000001
example the weird temperature

518.08 --> 522.399
differentials

520.159 --> 526.72
that it's hotter

522.399 --> 526.72
directly outside the sun than inside

527.12 --> 533.519
i drew the conclusion like oh does that

529.2 --> 536.72
mean it's actually like an electric lamp

533.519 --> 538.48
and has like microwave type effects then

536.72 --> 541.76
it makes sense it doesn't make sense if

538.48 --> 543.9200000000001
it's just a burning fire

541.76 --> 546.48
then that doesn't make sense

543.92 --> 550.3199999999999
but if it's more like

546.48 --> 553.6
gases being electrified like a gas lamp

550.32 --> 558.5600000000001
then it kind of makes sense to me

553.6 --> 558.5600000000001
anyway it's only within that crazy model

559.2 --> 566.0
hey kevlar rig back

563.44 --> 569.8800000000001
matthew hall the other andrew

566.0 --> 569.88
oh yeah i already said hello

593.12 --> 597.12
but any feedback on my show yesterday am

595.68 --> 599.3599999999999
i doing all right what do you think

597.12 --> 599.36
about

600.0 --> 605.2
flat earth related or spawned

603.12 --> 609.44
because it's not really really it's just

605.2 --> 611.76
it spawned it the the flat earth

609.44 --> 614.1600000000001
related mechanics explanation that i

611.76 --> 616.48
give for example about the whole gas not

614.16 --> 617.36
having mass all that you know

616.48 --> 619.6800000000001
i

617.36 --> 620.88
feel sometimes like i am conjuring it

619.68 --> 623.04
because

620.88 --> 625.2
it's not like i'm copying it of someone

623.04 --> 626.7199999999999
something else

625.2 --> 630.0
it's like

626.72 --> 631.76
i had to assemble all that through all

630.0 --> 634.16
the knowledge that i've been gathering

631.76 --> 636.88
over the last five years

634.16 --> 639.76
and from way before that references but

636.88 --> 639.76
still it's like

640.079 --> 643.76
and i get so much resistance

644.64 --> 650.48
but i hope you guys at least get it like

648.399 --> 652.56
i didn't i don't want you all to just

650.48 --> 654.48
say yes or when yes or when of course i

652.56 --> 657.04
win i just

654.48 --> 659.9200000000001
i really hope you guys get it and that

657.04 --> 663.519
you at some point maybe in less

659.92 --> 665.519
pressured situation could explain it

663.519 --> 669.12
that carefully too

665.519 --> 671.12
with interactions i really hope that

669.12 --> 673.44
so i'd like some feedback

671.12 --> 675.44
if you guys care for that if you're in

673.44 --> 676.32
the mood

675.44 --> 680.6
yeah

676.32 --> 680.6
hello hello robert digital

688.16 --> 690.56
what the

696.399 --> 700.399
should have left the trigger troll not

698.16 --> 700.399
block

701.519 --> 706.399
right yeah i i agree matthew

704.24 --> 706.399
i

707.279 --> 711.12
it's just that he was really making an

709.36 --> 712.5600000000001
effort at the end to just make

711.12 --> 716.2
everything ugly

712.56 --> 716.1999999999999
and then like

716.72 --> 719.76
yeah i just

722.32 --> 728.32
like i i had enough of it but i at least

726.0 --> 731.36
most of it

728.32 --> 732.72
was still very much clear in the

731.36 --> 733.92
you know

732.72 --> 738.12
in the

733.92 --> 738.12
in the side chat over there

745.76 --> 750.48
not letting anything get in this yeah

747.6 --> 753.2
yeah yeah i was very happy about that

750.48 --> 755.76
i mean i guess that when i get a bit

753.2 --> 758.0790000000001
more triggered

755.76 --> 759.279
at least when i get triggered i try to

758.079 --> 761.3599999999999
do it well

759.279 --> 764.079
right it's like okay if i'm gonna get

761.36 --> 766.16
triggered then at least i'm gonna

764.079 --> 768.4799999999999
make something

766.16 --> 769.68
worthwhile out of it

768.48 --> 771.9200000000001
but

769.68 --> 775.04
i prefer much more the times when i i

771.92 --> 777.279
really really just think just bounces

775.04 --> 777.279
off

780.959 --> 784.079
like a

782.8 --> 788.8
yeah

784.079 --> 788.8
like a an arrow of a breastplate right

789.12 --> 792.72
and it just like it doesn't faze me it

791.04 --> 794.399
just doesn't change my mood that's much

792.72 --> 795.36
better but it's just not always like

794.399 --> 798.56
that

795.36 --> 802.0
like i i don't really have

798.56 --> 803.92
control over how triggerable i am in

802.0 --> 806.48
today it's like i'm pretty much

803.92 --> 808.959
dependent it seems on like what's

806.48 --> 811.12
happening in the weather and all that

808.959 --> 813.92
astrological influence is where the moon

811.12 --> 817.04
is at and that just kind of determines

813.92 --> 819.92
what my ability range will be

817.04 --> 823.36
and i have to and like it really does

819.92 --> 826.959
force me to improvise all the time

823.36 --> 828.88
like what am i in this moment what can i

826.959 --> 830.3199999999999
do with that how can i get the best out

828.88 --> 831.4399999999999
of it and still

830.32 --> 834.1600000000001
grow

831.44 --> 837.0400000000001
all factors not abandon

834.16 --> 837.76
things that i could do in another moment

837.04 --> 839.76
right

837.76 --> 843.8389999999999
it's yeah

839.76 --> 843.8389999999999
it's quite chaotic being me sometimes

845.12 --> 850.0
then yeah that's also why sometimes when

848.0 --> 851.04
especially when things get really heated

850.0 --> 854.32
and

851.04 --> 857.8389999999999
all over the place then i'm like like

854.32 --> 857.839
who am i am i me

858.16 --> 862.8
like and it's not a joke when i say that

861.04 --> 864.079
it's like in that moment it's really

862.8 --> 866.8
like whoa

864.079 --> 866.8
what am i

867.12 --> 871.44
because

868.24 --> 873.6
my internal workings are

871.44 --> 876.24
over the place it's it's really my

873.6 --> 878.9590000000001
analytical ability that all keeps it

876.24 --> 880.32
kinda together whatever it is

878.959 --> 883.04
you know

880.32 --> 886.0
thank god i have that otherwise i'd just

883.04 --> 888.16
be a crazy person

886.0 --> 891.44
that nobody would be like what the [ __ ]

888.16 --> 893.199
is he on about now this is

891.44 --> 895.2790000000001
kind of like what the fl anti-flat

893.199 --> 897.8389999999999
earthers think

895.279 --> 900.079
that i am right i would actually be that

897.839 --> 902.8000000000001
but i'm not because i do have

900.079 --> 902.8
oversight

906.399 --> 910.92
derp award-winning stuff

912.32 --> 917.0400000000001
yeah adam adam l what

918.88 --> 923.519
but it was kind of funny he started out

922.079 --> 927.4399999999999
like around

923.519 --> 929.6
80 90 iq that's not even

927.44 --> 931.6
the idea of what people have about that

929.6 --> 934.639
it's not literally that

931.6 --> 937.12
but he as as the show progressed and i

934.639 --> 940.5600000000001
kept just kept keeping in

937.12 --> 944.399
i kept him in there

940.56 --> 947.3599999999999
he like visibly degenerated like he's

944.399 --> 949.04
sunk down to like

947.36 --> 952.0
max 80

949.04 --> 953.199
and sometimes like six it just became so

952.0 --> 956.16
derpy

953.199 --> 957.279
so indeed he does truly deserve a derp

956.16 --> 961.24
award

957.279 --> 961.24
so you can start water hello

968.0 --> 972.079
condo with the different energies right

970.16 --> 973.92
this is part of the reason also right

972.079 --> 976.16
back why i say like all the information

973.92 --> 978.3199999999999
comes from god it's just whatever

976.16 --> 981.279
he's gonna throw it at me

978.32 --> 982.8000000000001
and i somehow with what i am in the

981.279 --> 984.399
moment

982.8 --> 986.16
have to catch it

984.399 --> 988.639
since every day i just have to catch

986.16 --> 991.199
what god throws at me and like try to

988.639 --> 992.9590000000001
work it out the best i can and if i

991.199 --> 994.7199999999999
don't do it

992.959 --> 996.3199999999999
then everything

994.72 --> 998.8000000000001
yeah

996.32 --> 1001.839
then i go astray and then i then i

998.8 --> 1001.8389999999999
really become lost

1002.48 --> 1004.639
so

1009.44 --> 1014.9590000000001
but i do have a very

1011.519 --> 1017.04
wide dynamic as to

1014.959 --> 1019.68
where i can go right i think that a lot

1017.04 --> 1021.759
of people kind of have similar facts ups

1019.68 --> 1023.8389999999999
and downs right i typically like that

1021.759 --> 1026.4
reference

1023.839 --> 1028.64
swing of the pendulum it it really does

1026.4 --> 1029.679
apply to most people there's very few

1028.64 --> 1031.8390000000002
people

1029.679 --> 1033.679
very very few that don't have some kind

1031.839 --> 1036.079
of swing of a pendulum effect throughout

1033.679 --> 1038.88
their life

1036.079 --> 1041.9189999999999
but most people what they do is

1038.88 --> 1044.88
they find the best point

1041.919 --> 1046.72
in in that arc of the swing

1044.88 --> 1048.48
and they focus everything on that and

1046.72 --> 1050.84
then as soon as they can't maintain that

1048.48 --> 1053.3600000000001
anymore it slides further or they go

1050.84 --> 1054.72
overkill then they just break off and

1053.36 --> 1057.4399999999998
they just

1054.72 --> 1059.28
go do things more privately

1057.44 --> 1060.64
and they're afraid to do anything with

1059.28 --> 1062.3999999999999
that or it's like they think it's

1060.64 --> 1063.8400000000001
disruptive

1062.4 --> 1066.96
or it'll

1063.84 --> 1068.559
negate some kind of a weave effect that

1066.96 --> 1071.679
they've been trying to establish if

1068.559 --> 1075.039
they're like really into media

1071.679 --> 1079.039
and then they don't go there well i

1075.039 --> 1082.559
i grab every single part of the swing

1079.039 --> 1084.64
ups and downs dyed slounds up doubts

1082.559 --> 1085.6789999999999
slides up growths

1084.64 --> 1087.919
peaks

1085.679 --> 1091.679
valleys everything

1087.919 --> 1095.2
and that is really unusual

1091.679 --> 1098.4
i mean series that's really unusual

1095.2 --> 1098.4
for people to do that

1100.799 --> 1104.08
right

1102.08 --> 1107.6789999999999
i think the only real associations we

1104.08 --> 1109.4399999999998
even have with people that do that is

1107.679 --> 1111.3600000000001
like

1109.44 --> 1113.8400000000001
people that just don't have control over

1111.36 --> 1116.4799999999998
themselves and will just like go on

1113.84 --> 1119.039
maniacal rants or get super angry or

1116.48 --> 1121.039
super complainy pants right

1119.039 --> 1122.799
because they let themselves go they

1121.039 --> 1124.96
don't have a grip they don't know how to

1122.799 --> 1126.08
do something constructive

1124.96 --> 1128.0
with that

1126.08 --> 1131.28
frequency that

1128.0 --> 1134.08
they're subjected to in that swing

1131.28 --> 1136.16
and so they just go ballistic

1134.08 --> 1138.48
they bother people or they become like

1136.16 --> 1140.48
really creepy obsessive about something

1138.48 --> 1142.799
you know and troll

1140.48 --> 1143.76
it's all because they don't know how to

1142.799 --> 1145.52
deal

1143.76 --> 1149.039
the different

1145.52 --> 1151.2
frequencies they're subjected to

1149.039 --> 1154.48
and then they don't deal with it if you

1151.2 --> 1157.52
don't deal with it it deals with you and

1154.48 --> 1159.679
you become a subconscious conduit for

1157.52 --> 1161.76
things that ride on that frequency you

1159.679 --> 1163.039
start to act like that frequency without

1161.76 --> 1164.799
grip

1163.039 --> 1165.919
people lose control over their lives

1164.799 --> 1169.44
that way

1165.919 --> 1169.44
their social lives especially

1169.84 --> 1174.08
and that's part of the reason why i

1171.84 --> 1177.039
involve all of it

1174.08 --> 1179.84
it is a study it's a very serious

1177.039 --> 1181.36
psychological study

1179.84 --> 1184.0
what i do

1181.36 --> 1186.799
and i am the subject and ev in the world

1184.0 --> 1186.799
is the subject

1187.84 --> 1190.84
anyway

1201.44 --> 1205.8400000000001
they won't settle for a nap if they

1203.36 --> 1210.7199999999998
don't get enough hugs and kisses it's

1205.84 --> 1210.72
pets yeah you do pets can be

1210.96 --> 1215.3600000000001
just like children

1213.2 --> 1218.32
to give them too much love then they'll

1215.36 --> 1220.559
like get conditioned to get that and

1218.32 --> 1223.2
they will try to condition you to give

1220.559 --> 1223.2
that to them

1223.679 --> 1226.679
yep

1238.159 --> 1242.72
it's just hard to think of doing it in

1240.08 --> 1243.76
here at the moment yeah but godzilla

1242.72 --> 1246.84
now look

1243.76 --> 1251.36
if you're yeah if you're like

1246.84 --> 1251.36
exploding right the thing is

1251.919 --> 1256.72
it depends on the power of the explosion

1255.039 --> 1259.12
this is how metaphorical this is like

1256.72 --> 1260.96
energy emotion

1259.12 --> 1262.8799999999999
situation

1260.96 --> 1265.52
and if there's a whole bunch of things

1262.88 --> 1266.7990000000002
that need to come out that need to be

1265.52 --> 1270.6399999999999
expressed

1266.799 --> 1271.52
and sometimes it's not good to hold back

1270.64 --> 1274.0800000000002
right

1271.52 --> 1276.559
then you get like into then because then

1274.08 --> 1280.799
it starts to deflect back

1276.559 --> 1280.799
from that shield onto yourself and then

1281.12 --> 1285.039
yeah that can be unhealthy

1288.84 --> 1293.6
so

1290.48 --> 1296.64
i try to stop myself

1293.6 --> 1299.1999999999998
when it's like safe too

1296.64 --> 1301.5200000000002
right i don't you never catch me just

1299.2 --> 1303.2
like never stopping i would just keep on

1301.52 --> 1305.039
ranting and ranting and ranting and

1303.2 --> 1306.4
pushing and pushing i don't do that like

1305.039 --> 1308.96
that

1306.4 --> 1312.0800000000002
sometimes it's got to come out and then

1308.96 --> 1314.24
like as soon as like that's done it's

1312.08 --> 1316.24
like i can like

1314.24 --> 1319.039
immediately pull the gauge down and be

1316.24 --> 1322.4
super calm and then i am super calm

1319.039 --> 1324.559
because the thing that really triggered

1322.4 --> 1326.88
the situation is out

1324.559 --> 1330.32
and i don't let it linger i don't get

1326.88 --> 1333.2
like hungry for the rage i don't

1330.32 --> 1335.2
i really really don't

1333.2 --> 1338.24
yeah i don't like

1335.2 --> 1338.24
being enraged

1342.0 --> 1345.039
sometimes

1343.36 --> 1346.9599999999998
i'm impressed

1345.039 --> 1349.039
by what comes out

1346.96 --> 1352.24
but i don't like it i never do and i

1349.039 --> 1352.24
never seek it out

1353.76 --> 1357.039
it's kind of like i guess very similar

1355.84 --> 1358.48
to the

1357.039 --> 1361.36
karate kid

1358.48 --> 1363.679
principle like never

1361.36 --> 1368.0
don't learn karate to fight

1363.679 --> 1370.64
learn so you never have to fight

1368.0 --> 1373.84
and that's the way i kind of

1370.64 --> 1377.1200000000001
deal with it or i try to it's a yeah a

1373.84 --> 1377.12
principle i try to follow

1377.84 --> 1381.6
never fall in love with it never fall in

1379.919 --> 1385.2800000000002
love with the power

1381.6 --> 1388.08
it could bring right because then it

1385.28 --> 1389.6
it gains you the power gains control

1388.08 --> 1392.0
over you

1389.6 --> 1392.0
anyway

1398.559 --> 1403.84
oh yeah at that

1400.08 --> 1405.12
point just go postal

1403.84 --> 1406.9599999999998
what

1405.12 --> 1410.4799999999998
no

1406.96 --> 1410.48
no never go postal

1411.76 --> 1413.76
right

1412.559 --> 1418.3999999999999
that's the

1413.76 --> 1418.4
going postal is the most tragic thing

1418.88 --> 1422.3200000000002
because

1420.32 --> 1423.279
why are you frustrated

1422.32 --> 1426.0
right

1423.279 --> 1429.279
when you go postal it is the

1426.0 --> 1431.44
the the the true deserving

1429.279 --> 1433.2
target of that frustration are they

1431.44 --> 1435.279
getting it

1433.2 --> 1437.52
usually not

1435.279 --> 1437.52
yeah

1438.08 --> 1442.72
usually they don't

1440.72 --> 1445.6000000000001
i would rather see

1442.72 --> 1448.559
somehow that people managed to like not

1445.6 --> 1451.36
do that and then if they like cannot

1448.559 --> 1454.3999999999999
stop themselves that they at least find

1451.36 --> 1459.279
a way to actually bring the destruction

1454.4 --> 1461.8400000000001
to the ones that truly caused it like

1459.279 --> 1463.52
not just somebody that happened to poke

1461.84 --> 1465.039
you in the wrong way in that day or

1463.52 --> 1466.96
something right

1465.039 --> 1468.24
because they felt like a dick in that

1466.96 --> 1470.24
moment

1468.24 --> 1473.44
that's terrible

1470.24 --> 1476.4
those never deserve the ones that truly

1473.44 --> 1479.8400000000001
trigger something deep

1476.4 --> 1479.8400000000001
they never deserve that

1480.32 --> 1485.52
because they are not the ones that cause

1482.96 --> 1486.4
that stress

1485.52 --> 1488.4
no

1486.4 --> 1490.88
there's other things out there in the

1488.4 --> 1492.48
world causing that so it would be great

1490.88 --> 1495.7600000000002
that if you have like

1492.48 --> 1498.32
berserk moment that you at least don't

1495.76 --> 1500.64
harm people that usually don't deserve

1498.32 --> 1502.96
it or not to that level

1500.64 --> 1502.96
right

1511.44 --> 1514.44
oh

1515.039 --> 1519.84
good

1516.159 --> 1522.88
don't don't promote going postal

1519.84 --> 1524.8799999999999
i mean it seems sometimes like i am a

1522.88 --> 1526.7990000000002
bit like that or i'm enacting that

1524.88 --> 1528.4
especially when i'm like

1526.799 --> 1530.4
like screaming

1528.4 --> 1533.6000000000001
like they gotta die and

1530.4 --> 1533.6000000000001
but that is not

1533.84 --> 1539.4399999999998
physical action that's like that's just

1536.799 --> 1539.44
a spirit

1539.52 --> 1544.6399999999999
it's just like

1541.2 --> 1546.88
what i imagine that people

1544.64 --> 1549.279
that are on that frequency

1546.88 --> 1551.3600000000001
must carry like there there's people out

1549.279 --> 1552.32
there carrying that

1551.36 --> 1554.3999999999999
and i'm

1552.32 --> 1556.559
and i kind of like

1554.4 --> 1559.44
i don't want them to just suffocate

1556.559 --> 1562.32
under that i want them to realize

1559.44 --> 1565.1200000000001
you have a purpose for that

1562.32 --> 1567.279
like going postal and just like

1565.12 --> 1571.7199999999998
some random people and yourself

1567.279 --> 1571.72
that's not what that's for

1572.559 --> 1578.48
it should never lead to that

1575.12 --> 1578.4799999999998
it is super tragic

1581.2 --> 1583.52
right

1583.6 --> 1589.279
that those impulses that that supe that

1586.48 --> 1591.3600000000001
violent hunger for justice

1589.279 --> 1593.2
is really more like a soldiering

1591.36 --> 1596.3999999999999
instinct thing

1593.2 --> 1596.4
and it's just not being

1596.84 --> 1603.76
utilized and it's it's just tragic if

1600.24 --> 1606.4
then people go postal

1603.76 --> 1606.4
it's tragic

1607.6 --> 1610.6
right

1616.96 --> 1619.96
so

1637.919 --> 1641.8400000000001
a wall of shame hmm

1643.36 --> 1645.6789999999999
what

1647.76 --> 1650.96
well

1648.72 --> 1653.2
terror 306 there's already a wall of

1650.96 --> 1656.88
shame it's been yeah that's just the

1653.2 --> 1659.919
anti-flat earthers i mean

1656.88 --> 1661.8400000000001
it's more like a i call that

1659.919 --> 1664.24
it's a

1661.84 --> 1666.559
board that you can like basically put

1664.24 --> 1668.3990000000001
notes on with

1666.559 --> 1670.32
with the nails

1668.399 --> 1672.32
more like that

1670.32 --> 1674.799
it's like this board

1672.32 --> 1678.6
with just all the crazy people

1674.799 --> 1678.6
the anti-flat earthers

1682.64 --> 1689.44
hey tony whitcomb

1685.2 --> 1689.44
marinating goat curry

1689.679 --> 1693.679
that's

1690.72 --> 1697.84
sounds interesting

1693.679 --> 1697.8400000000001
hey wrath good to see you

1711.84 --> 1715.84
yeah

1712.799 --> 1718.6399999999999
nathan's new slideshow is pretty cool

1715.84 --> 1720.1589999999999
i'm just kind of sad because now i don't

1718.64 --> 1722.3990000000001
have

1720.159 --> 1723.279
my two pictures in the slideshow anymore

1722.399 --> 1727.279
i don't

1723.279 --> 1727.279
i don't see them anymore and i'm like ah

1728.159 --> 1732.3990000000001
like the picture with me receiving the

1730.64 --> 1736.3200000000002
camera which was like a really good

1732.399 --> 1739.12
picture i looked good in that i'm like

1736.32 --> 1741.279
like that's a good picture of me

1739.12 --> 1743.36
i really appreciated that he used that

1741.279 --> 1745.76
and it's fun because it's a reminder of

1743.36 --> 1747.84
when we actually met in person

1745.76 --> 1749.76
and the other one is insidious when and

1747.84 --> 1752.48
it's kind of a joke on me but i kind of

1749.76 --> 1752.48
do like it

1753.44 --> 1758.88
i like that joke about me

1756.72 --> 1760.96
so i'm kind of like the new slideshow he

1758.88 --> 1762.0800000000002
made in the backdrop for a show is

1760.96 --> 1766.559
pretty cool

1762.08 --> 1768.48
but i'm kind of missing my old pictures

1766.559 --> 1771.6
oh well

1768.48 --> 1771.6
still had him for like

1771.679 --> 1774.72
years

1773.2 --> 1778.76
three years

1774.72 --> 1778.76
so i shouldn't be complaining

1784.96 --> 1789.279
what my block list

1786.96 --> 1791.679
we got the na yeah but that's just sock

1789.279 --> 1795.039
accounts there it

1791.679 --> 1797.1200000000001
like the real anti-flat earther idiots

1795.039 --> 1800.8799999999999
i don't block them

1797.12 --> 1801.84
unless they go like squirty overkill

1800.88 --> 1803.279
whatever

1801.84 --> 1806.32
in my chat but

1803.279 --> 1808.64
usually when when i know there's like a

1806.32 --> 1809.9189999999999
an anti-flat earther or a glober that

1808.64 --> 1813.6000000000001
actually

1809.919 --> 1815.3600000000001
represents that does shows and all that

1813.6 --> 1816.7199999999998
i have a little bit more respect for

1815.36 --> 1818.8799999999999
them even if they're acting like

1816.72 --> 1822.3990000000001
complete buffoons right and they're just

1818.88 --> 1825.3600000000001
being absolutely numpty-ish as [ __ ]

1822.399 --> 1827.4399999999998
i don't mind because at least

1825.36 --> 1829.76
they're honest enough to just

1827.44 --> 1831.52
represent

1829.76 --> 1834.64
right

1831.52 --> 1837.9189999999999
so my my block list is mostly filled

1834.64 --> 1840.24
with anonymous shitty socks

1837.919 --> 1842.64
and i have no respect for for those

1840.24 --> 1842.64
people

1846.72 --> 1850.64
i think i just summoned them

1849.12 --> 1851.4399999999998
but

1850.64 --> 1853.919
yeah

1851.44 --> 1855.6000000000001
if it's somebody that's actually

1853.919 --> 1858.3990000000001
represented

1855.6 --> 1860.799
especially if they've been on camera

1858.399 --> 1863.279
defending their their viewpoints i have

1860.799 --> 1866.399
a lot more respect for them even if they

1863.279 --> 1868.32
act like complete idiots

1866.399 --> 1870.0
even if they're embarrassing or if

1868.32 --> 1871.36
they're like

1870.0 --> 1874.24
lying

1871.36 --> 1876.32
i'll have more respect for them

1874.24 --> 1879.2
even when they do all that than i would

1876.32 --> 1881.6
for basically people that are completely

1879.2 --> 1883.6000000000001
anonymous

1881.6 --> 1885.6789999999999
and the only way to even recognize who

1883.6 --> 1888.9599999999998
they are is by

1885.679 --> 1892.2
how stupid they tend to sound when they

1888.96 --> 1892.2
say things

1892.32 --> 1897.279
right

1894.08 --> 1898.24
or some other like sock named

1897.279 --> 1901.039
trait

1898.24 --> 1903.679
they typically pick certain names

1901.039 --> 1906.72
that's it that's all you know

1903.679 --> 1909.1200000000001
those people have absolutely no respect

1906.72 --> 1911.1200000000001
and no mercy for

1909.12 --> 1914.7199999999998
and they are typically the ones that do

1911.12 --> 1914.7199999999998
drive me more ballistic

1916.64 --> 1919.279
it's because i don't have respect for

1918.24 --> 1921.679
them

1919.279 --> 1923.36
yeah

1921.679 --> 1926.3200000000002
people that

1923.36 --> 1928.7199999999998
don't deserve respect deserve

1926.32 --> 1930.32
harshness

1928.72 --> 1934.679
in my opinion

1930.32 --> 1934.6789999999999
deserve to be treated harshly

1943.36 --> 1946.08
thank you gorzilla for the super chat

1944.96 --> 1949.559
donation

1946.08 --> 1949.559
flying pair

1957.519 --> 1963.519
do you think lands beyond the arctic

1960.24 --> 1967.039
circle got internet uh

1963.519 --> 1967.039
well not public internet

1969.039 --> 1974.0
i mean i'm pretty sure they got like

1971.919 --> 1974.88
satellite connection

1974.0 --> 1976.64
i mean

1974.88 --> 1981.0390000000002
all you really need even for fast

1976.64 --> 1981.039
distance is just a a very strong

1981.279 --> 1984.399
like

1982.72 --> 1986.3990000000001
basically

1984.399 --> 1988.4799999999998
a big antenna

1986.399 --> 1990.9599999999998
a tower

1988.48 --> 1994.559
with like focused

1990.96 --> 1994.559
beam radio connection

1995.12 --> 1999.1999999999998
right

1996.159 --> 2002.0800000000002
and like if you like specifically design

1999.2 --> 2004.3990000000001
them to go very long distance and then

2002.08 --> 2007.039
focus beams

2004.399 --> 2008.799
so minimum signal loss over fast yeah

2007.039 --> 2010.96
that you could build that it's not it

2008.799 --> 2014.799
shouldn't be that difficult

2010.96 --> 2016.8400000000001
to have like just two towers

2014.799 --> 2020.559
at somewhere at the edge of

2016.84 --> 2021.6789999999999
antarctica and beyond it or whatever is

2020.559 --> 2023.6789999999999
there

2021.679 --> 2024.72
just two towers

2023.679 --> 2027.279
i mean

2024.72 --> 2029.6000000000001
okay if there's like giant storms

2027.279 --> 2031.919
happening snow storms then that's gonna

2029.6 --> 2035.039
disrupt it but in a clear day it's just

2031.919 --> 2038.64
going to be like no problem

2035.039 --> 2041.36
in i think i mean i'm not

2038.64 --> 2043.44
an engineer

2041.36 --> 2044.399
but i think that's that shouldn't be too

2043.44 --> 2046.88
difficult

2044.399 --> 2049.52
to achieve so internet connection beyond

2046.88 --> 2051.2000000000003
antarctica sure why not

2049.52 --> 2052.879
i wouldn't go with the cable though i

2051.2 --> 2056.96
mean those are gonna

2052.879 --> 2056.96
have some serious issues with frost

2058.159 --> 2062.7200000000003
but yeah wireless signal over fast

2060.96 --> 2065.359
distances i don't think that should

2062.72 --> 2070.0789999999997
shouldn't be too big of an issue

2065.359 --> 2072.48
if it was specifically built to do that

2070.079 --> 2072.48
anyway

2073.76 --> 2078.3990000000003
hello

2075.2 --> 2078.399
trone modern

2078.96 --> 2082.76
welcome to the chat

2102.32 --> 2105.8
oh god

2124.56 --> 2131.56
my god somebody squirty today

2128.16 --> 2131.56
look at that

2134.24 --> 2137.2
yeah so

2137.599 --> 2142.32
that's 100 projection there from the

2140.24 --> 2146.3199999999997
grave

2142.32 --> 2148.4
just exchange flat with ball

2146.32 --> 2150.8
and then you are a hundred percent

2148.4 --> 2153.839
correct if you only change the word flat

2150.8 --> 2156.4
the first word just put there with ball

2153.839 --> 2159.839
and then yeah then you are a hundred

2156.4 --> 2159.839
percent right

2166.0 --> 2169.839
yeah

2167.76 --> 2171.6800000000003
you don't have a size you don't really

2169.839 --> 2173.7599999999998
have a shape you don't even know what

2171.68 --> 2175.04
shape it is oh it's a sphere oh no it's

2173.76 --> 2177.119
pear-shaped oh

2175.04 --> 2179.7599999999998
it's a dingleberry uh

2177.119 --> 2182.1600000000003
you don't have a model it's not complete

2179.76 --> 2184.1600000000003
yeah you don't have maps because all

2182.16 --> 2186.3999999999996
your maps are based

2184.16 --> 2187.5989999999997
on celestial

2186.4 --> 2189.839
lights

2187.599 --> 2192.079
over a flat plane that's how it was

2189.839 --> 2193.839
designed

2192.079 --> 2194.96
you don't have a dome you need one

2193.839 --> 2196.7999999999997
though

2194.96 --> 2199.2
because otherwise you wouldn't be able

2196.8 --> 2201.119
to breathe the gas on earth

2199.2 --> 2204.0789999999997
you don't have data that's correct

2201.119 --> 2207.52
because most of the globe model is based

2204.079 --> 2209.28
on mathematical conjugations

2207.52 --> 2211.7599999999998
you don't have evidence that's right you

2209.28 --> 2215.6800000000003
don't have scientific evidence

2211.76 --> 2218.4
and you have no math i don't know

2215.68 --> 2220.96
well you do have a lot of math i guess

2218.4 --> 2223.04
but it's just conceptual i don't even

2220.96 --> 2224.96
know why anybody would care no science

2223.04 --> 2227.2799999999997
well that we know the ball has no

2224.96 --> 2228.48
science housekeeping questions no

2227.28 --> 2231.119
understanding

2228.48 --> 2233.28
absolutely the only way you can even

2231.119 --> 2235.839
survive debating a flat earther is

2233.28 --> 2237.0400000000004
through sheer pure dementia and double

2235.839 --> 2239.119
think

2237.04 --> 2240.96
no explanations

2239.119 --> 2243.04
yeah you don't really have explanations

2240.96 --> 2245.52
ballers at these days just have

2243.04 --> 2247.04
assertions they just assert things they

2245.52 --> 2248.88
don't explain it

2247.04 --> 2251.04
if you ask them to explain it they'll

2248.88 --> 2252.6400000000003
just wander off to something else or

2251.04 --> 2254.4
another question scattergunning they

2252.64 --> 2256.72
like that know anything yeah that's

2254.4 --> 2258.48
right the ball earth has absolutely

2256.72 --> 2260.0789999999997
nothing

2258.48 --> 2262.079
why do i believe

2260.079 --> 2263.3590000000004
in the ball earth

2262.079 --> 2265.599
because

2263.359 --> 2267.52
you can't stop you can't stop believing

2265.599 --> 2271.32
in the ball earth

2267.52 --> 2271.32
so thank you for that

2273.2 --> 2278.359
i hope that answers your question from

2275.2 --> 2278.359
the grave

2285.599 --> 2289.2400000000002
hey geo shifter

2310.56 --> 2315.2799999999997
oh dear it's gonna be one of those

2312.24 --> 2315.2799999999997
saturdays isn't it

2315.839 --> 2322.56
the overwhelming evidence oh you mean

2319.68 --> 2325.7999999999997
the overwhelming details of everything i

2322.56 --> 2325.7999999999997
just addressed

2326.4 --> 2331.839
so what is your overwhelming evidence

2328.48 --> 2331.839
then devin boch

2331.92 --> 2337.44
what's your overwhelming evidence

2334.64 --> 2342.4
i mean anything could be described as

2337.44 --> 2342.4
overwhelming evidence but what is it

2346.8 --> 2349.2000000000003
i mean

2349.599 --> 2355.839
how

2351.76 --> 2355.8390000000004
how did you measure the radius

2356.64 --> 2360.0
yeah

2358.48 --> 2363.52
how did you measure it without the

2360.0 --> 2365.76
horizon being geometric how did you do

2363.52 --> 2365.7599999999998
that

2368.24 --> 2372.9599999999996
oh see move on to the next one yeah

2373.52 --> 2376.8
i don't know why i even try

2380.32 --> 2386.7200000000003
different stars in

2384.0 --> 2388.4
yeah a geometric orientation that you

2386.72 --> 2390.56
presuppose about the earth you're

2388.4 --> 2394.1600000000003
standing on why do we see different

2390.56 --> 2397.4
stars on what i assume is the other side

2394.16 --> 2397.3999999999996
of the globe

2398.0 --> 2401.28
well it isn't

2399.359 --> 2404.16
another side of a globe

2401.28 --> 2405.92
it's just the other region south of the

2404.16 --> 2408.8799999999997
equator

2405.92 --> 2410.64
right and yeah the stars have an angular

2408.88 --> 2412.96
relation

2410.64 --> 2414.8799999999997
to the observer's position on earth and

2412.96 --> 2416.2400000000002
that's it's like this

2414.88 --> 2419.28
ball

2416.24 --> 2420.4799999999996
that's virtually not actually surround

2419.28 --> 2422.5600000000004
you

2420.48 --> 2426.64
and yeah i know you like to fantasize

2422.56 --> 2428.7999999999997
how that only can exist if

2426.64 --> 2430.56
there's a ball underneath it i know all

2428.8 --> 2432.4
about that

2430.56 --> 2434.56
but there isn't a ball underneath it the

2432.4 --> 2436.2400000000002
earth is very flat the horizon isn't

2434.56 --> 2438.7999999999997
geometric there's black swan

2436.24 --> 2441.839
observations where you can see

2438.8 --> 2445.44
extremely far at extremely

2441.839 --> 2447.119
minimalized observation height

2445.44 --> 2449.92
that prove it's not

2447.119 --> 2450.839
the ball that you ball believers needed

2449.92 --> 2455.599
to

2450.839 --> 2458.48
be yeah so why do you see these stars at

2455.599 --> 2461.6800000000003
another angle south of the equator

2458.48 --> 2463.68
because that's how the celestial sphere

2461.68 --> 2466.0789999999997
works

2463.68 --> 2467.2
its angles change depending on your

2466.079 --> 2469.92
position

2467.2 --> 2472.8799999999997
on the flat earth

2469.92 --> 2476.4
yeah because they're not literal giant

2472.88 --> 2478.319
things at vast distances in which earth

2476.4 --> 2479.92
is a ball in between

2478.319 --> 2482.319
that's the that's the part where you

2479.92 --> 2485.28
presuppose things because you don't have

2482.319 --> 2487.839
what it requires you know to actually

2485.28 --> 2489.76
finalize that claim

2487.839 --> 2491.92
you see you don't have a geometric

2489.76 --> 2494.48
horizon

2491.92 --> 2496.64
in order to establish that the earth is

2494.48 --> 2499.52
indeed a ball

2496.64 --> 2502.0789999999997
underneath those ball of stars yeah

2499.52 --> 2504.96
underneath all that

2502.079 --> 2506.8390000000004
it's just holographic

2504.96 --> 2510.7200000000003
it's a light

2506.839 --> 2513.52
spectacle it seems like a sphere or a

2510.72 --> 2516.319
demisphere you never see the other half

2513.52 --> 2519.119
to the observers on camera animals

2516.319 --> 2522.079
probably see it everything

2519.119 --> 2524.0
sees that the lights up there like a

2522.079 --> 2525.8390000000004
sphere surrounding you

2524.0 --> 2528.48
but you only see half of it so it's a

2525.839 --> 2529.44
demi sphere

2528.48 --> 2530.88
but

2529.44 --> 2533.28
that's it right

2530.88 --> 2534.8
you don't have a ball earth underneath

2533.28 --> 2537.6800000000003
that

2534.8 --> 2538.6400000000003
it's not there

2537.68 --> 2540.64
you just

2538.64 --> 2542.64
imagine that it is

2540.64 --> 2544.56
and then think that you won the argument

2542.64 --> 2547.359
but you didn't because you didn't prove

2544.56 --> 2549.68
the earth is actually a ball

2547.359 --> 2552.0789999999997
you're just presupposing that and then

2549.68 --> 2555.04
saying oh why

2552.079 --> 2556.96
are the stars at another angle

2555.04 --> 2559.04
if we're on a ball and we're on the

2556.96 --> 2562.2400000000002
other side of the ball that's what

2559.04 --> 2565.839
you're saying that's your claim

2562.24 --> 2565.839
it doesn't work it's not an argument

2566.8 --> 2570.319
it's just hey

2568.079 --> 2571.92
in my fantasy of what i think the earth

2570.319 --> 2576.0
is

2571.92 --> 2578.079
why does it work the way that model idea

2576.0 --> 2580.319
works

2578.079 --> 2583.5600000000004
okay stop spamming thank you for that

2580.319 --> 2583.56
rig back

2593.44 --> 2595.76
ah

2595.92 --> 2601.28
dirt always finds its ball

2598.56 --> 2601.2799999999997
that's hilarious

2603.599 --> 2609.04
we don't

2605.76 --> 2612.7200000000003
then why don't we see the other stars

2609.04 --> 2614.56
getting dimmer as we move away

2612.72 --> 2617.839
i already explained that they're

2614.56 --> 2620.48
holographic they're not lights literally

2617.839 --> 2623.599
hovering over a disk

2620.48 --> 2626.16
that's just another presuppositions

2623.599 --> 2629.3590000000004
based on physicality assumption bias

2626.16 --> 2631.1189999999997
yeah it's holographic there are no stars

2629.359 --> 2635.44
in actual positions

2631.119 --> 2637.6800000000003
there's only angular apparent positions

2635.44 --> 2640.48
and those angular relations are

2637.68 --> 2640.48
persistent

2640.64 --> 2646.64
depending on the time frame

2643.119 --> 2648.7200000000003
and on the position on the flat earth

2646.64 --> 2652.8799999999997
they're not literally

2648.72 --> 2656.16
a sheet of stars moving over flat earth

2652.88 --> 2656.96
yeah that's just another presupposition

2656.16 --> 2659.52
that

2656.96 --> 2662.4
well sensible flat earthers don't hold

2659.52 --> 2664.24
on to some do and it's kind of stupid

2662.4 --> 2666.319
and i disagree when they do that because

2664.24 --> 2668.3999999999996
it just makes you look stupid they don't

2666.319 --> 2670.88
do that yeah they're holographic they're

2668.4 --> 2674.079
always going to represent them like a

2670.88 --> 2676.319
demisphere surrounding you

2674.079 --> 2678.96
changing its angle whatever you're going

2676.319 --> 2682.4
to do on the earth right

2678.96 --> 2685.119
they're not a sheet

2682.4 --> 2687.92
over a flat disc

2685.119 --> 2691.599
they're not in any position

2687.92 --> 2693.6800000000003
stars don't have actual positions

2691.599 --> 2696.079
they don't

2693.68 --> 2698.72
the only ones that actually claim they

2696.079 --> 2701.92
do are astronomers

2698.72 --> 2704.64
and they don't have proof that they do

2701.92 --> 2708.48
their proof for this is just a bunch of

2704.64 --> 2709.359
mathematical calculations and

2708.48 --> 2711.68
yeah

2709.359 --> 2714.319
just mathematical juggling it doesn't

2711.68 --> 2716.7999999999997
prove it yeah stars aren't in actual

2714.319 --> 2719.599
positions they're holographic they only

2716.8 --> 2723.44
have angular positions in relation to

2719.599 --> 2723.44
the observer on earth

2728.56 --> 2735.68
oh let's move on to the next

2732.319 --> 2737.7599999999998
do i have to refute everything a single

2735.68 --> 2739.68
outdated argument you're going to shove

2737.76 --> 2742.6400000000003
forward like scattergunning think you

2739.68 --> 2746.319
can get away i can explain every single

2742.64 --> 2749.1189999999997
thing i have for the past few years it's

2746.319 --> 2750.48
just i don't like doing that anymore

2749.119 --> 2754.7200000000003
because

2750.48 --> 2754.72
it's just getting so boring

2754.8 --> 2758.8
it's like

2755.92 --> 2761.119
i feel sometimes like i'm a magician

2758.8 --> 2764.319
doing the same boring trick over a

2761.119 --> 2766.6400000000003
freaking [ __ ] that just refused to get

2764.319 --> 2768.72
bored by it that's what it feels like

2766.64 --> 2771.68
it's getting annoying because you guys

2768.72 --> 2773.2
are so [ __ ] stupid it just gets

2771.68 --> 2775.839
annoying

2773.2 --> 2777.7599999999998
giving the same good explanations over

2775.839 --> 2779.839
and over again just so you can ignore

2777.76 --> 2782.2400000000002
them and move on to the next

2779.839 --> 2786.7599999999998
disproven explanation

2782.24 --> 2786.7599999999998
it really gets old

2788.48 --> 2790.8
ah

2793.2 --> 2797.2
can i explain mechanical gyros

2800.4 --> 2805.28
they retain their momentum

2803.599 --> 2809.28
angular momentum and that's how they

2805.28 --> 2809.28
stay rigid in their orientation

2811.839 --> 2816.64
that's right and

2813.599 --> 2818.56
yeah if you keep gyroscope mechanical

2816.64 --> 2821.44
one specifically mechanical if you keep

2818.56 --> 2823.119
it spun up like an engine that keeps on

2821.44 --> 2825.599
making it go

2823.119 --> 2828.96
you keep it in the same place

2825.599 --> 2831.44
it's gonna stay exactly

2828.96 --> 2834.2400000000002
the orientation of rotation that it

2831.44 --> 2836.319
started out with

2834.24 --> 2838.64
it's going to stay like that

2836.319 --> 2841.2
pretty much forever

2838.64 --> 2844.16
unless there's like design flaws and

2841.2 --> 2846.3999999999996
yeah it's unbalanced and then it might

2844.16 --> 2847.359
drift right but yeah

2846.4 --> 2849.04
that

2847.359 --> 2850.72
usually the modern

2849.04 --> 2852.5589999999997
gyroscopes even

2850.72 --> 2855.7599999999998
relatively cheap ones

2852.559 --> 2858.88
they get those flaws out that like that

2855.76 --> 2860.1600000000003
kind of stop being a problem after

2858.88 --> 2861.839
like

2860.16 --> 2865.1189999999997
industrial

2861.839 --> 2866.64
perfection with tools and all that

2865.119 --> 2869.2000000000003
they know how to get it perfectly

2866.64 --> 2871.2
balanced these days so

2869.2 --> 2873.359
they don't drift if you keep them in the

2871.2 --> 2875.1189999999997
same spot yeah

2873.359 --> 2877.119
funny thing is they don't really drift

2875.119 --> 2879.28
at all even if you move around with them

2877.119 --> 2881.839
if you put them in a truck and you drive

2879.28 --> 2884.1600000000003
for like hundreds of miles

2881.839 --> 2886.72
a thousand miles it's gonna stay the

2884.16 --> 2889.5989999999997
same orientation

2886.72 --> 2893.9199999999996
because the earth is stationary

2889.599 --> 2896.7200000000003
and the surface orientation is flat

2893.92 --> 2899.76
and gyroscopes because of their

2896.72 --> 2900.3999999999996
rigidity in space when when they're spun

2899.76 --> 2903.0400000000004
up

2900.4 --> 2905.2000000000003
angular momentum

2903.04 --> 2908.88
yeah they prove the earth is flat

2905.2 --> 2912.0789999999997
because they don't change their angle

2908.88 --> 2915.2000000000003
and they should because if if

2912.079 --> 2918.319
if we were on a ball gyroscopes would

2915.2 --> 2920.16
never be stable they would be very much

2918.319 --> 2922.24
unusable

2920.16 --> 2924.7999999999997
for what they are being used in industry

2922.24 --> 2926.839
their absolute stability and rigidity in

2924.8 --> 2931.2000000000003
space right because that's only

2926.839 --> 2932.7999999999997
functional in a world that's stationary

2931.2 --> 2934.8799999999997
if the earth were a spinning ball they

2932.8 --> 2936.48
would be completely useless as

2934.88 --> 2938.2400000000002
instruments

2936.48 --> 2940.559
for navigation

2938.24 --> 2942.3999999999996
for airplanes for ships

2940.559 --> 2944.1600000000003
they would be completely useless because

2942.4 --> 2948.2400000000002
they would never be stable they would

2944.16 --> 2948.24
always just change throughout the day

2948.48 --> 2952.4
right

2950.24 --> 2953.7599999999998
i mean you like

2952.4 --> 2956.319
let's just say you're in a freaking

2953.76 --> 2958.559
fighter jet right and you're it's

2956.319 --> 2961.04
clouded and you have to like you're in a

2958.559 --> 2962.88
combat you have to stay oriented you're

2961.04 --> 2964.72
gonna look at that freaking

2962.88 --> 2967.04
gyroscope

2964.72 --> 2968.9599999999996
like reading

2967.04 --> 2970.0
right in the moment because you need to

2968.96 --> 2971.92
know that you're not going to

2970.0 --> 2974.4
accidentally dive straight into the

2971.92 --> 2976.559
ocean or wherever you are

2974.4 --> 2978.64
you're going to need it to be exactly

2976.559 --> 2980.48
where it's supposed to be in that moment

2978.64 --> 2981.5989999999997
in a shock you're like oh i'm going to

2980.48 --> 2983.359
turn

2981.599 --> 2985.2000000000003
and you have to look at that freaking

2983.359 --> 2988.48
orientation of the gyroscope because it

2985.2 --> 2989.839
has to be perfect if that [ __ ] thing

2988.48 --> 2994.0
would change

2989.839 --> 2995.839
a full cycle throughout 24-hour day

2994.0 --> 2998.559
it would be a giant hazard you can't

2995.839 --> 3000.4
just in a fighter situation look at the

2998.559 --> 3002.4
freaking gyroscope read out and then

3000.4 --> 3006.48
like oh wait what time of the day is it

3002.4 --> 3010.599
oh that means it's actually there ah

3006.48 --> 3010.599
yeah that's what happens

3013.119 --> 3017.04
they have to be rigid

3015.359 --> 3018.319
or they're useless

3017.04 --> 3021.359
as tools

3018.319 --> 3021.359
what they're used for

3021.52 --> 3026.16
in airplanes they would be a hazard

3024.48 --> 3027.359
if the earth was actually a spinning

3026.16 --> 3029.68
ball

3027.359 --> 3032.24
because you'd constantly had to

3029.68 --> 3034.7999999999997
calculate like oh where is the gyroscope

3032.24 --> 3038.5589999999997
now in this time of the day

3034.8 --> 3041.3590000000004
does that mean that i'm perfectly level

3038.559 --> 3043.2000000000003
crazy crazy town

3041.359 --> 3046.16
it would be quite hazardous they would

3043.2 --> 3048.48
not be used they don't think flight

3046.16 --> 3050.64
would be as

3048.48 --> 3054.4
smoothly in general

3050.64 --> 3057.52
if the earth was a spinning ball but

3054.4 --> 3059.119
yeah that's a mechanical gyroscope

3057.52 --> 3062.079
they use

3059.119 --> 3064.88
because the earth is stationary and

3062.079 --> 3068.079
gyroscopes once spun up mechanical ones

3064.88 --> 3070.6400000000003
give a perfect euclidean rigidity in

3068.079 --> 3073.119
space because of their angular momentum

3070.64 --> 3075.2
so the entire thing

3073.119 --> 3077.44
even the casing and the

3075.2 --> 3079.04
machine that surrounds it can just

3077.44 --> 3082.079
subtly switch

3079.04 --> 3084.72
turn around whatever and the gyroscope

3082.079 --> 3087.44
inside spun up would be in exactly the

3084.72 --> 3090.24
same orientation and that's

3087.44 --> 3093.599
why it's such a useful tool because of

3090.24 --> 3096.3999999999996
that perfect rigidity so you can use it

3093.599 --> 3099.44
as a quick orientation tool you don't

3096.4 --> 3102.2400000000002
back calculate don't spend minutes doing

3099.44 --> 3104.64
some [ __ ] math

3102.24 --> 3106.5589999999997
like if you're like have to just know it

3104.64 --> 3109.04
in a second in half a second you look

3106.559 --> 3110.48
and like you have to do it now right you

3109.04 --> 3112.88
don't have time to freaking back

3110.48 --> 3116.2400000000002
calculate that [ __ ]

3112.88 --> 3116.2400000000002
you have to do it immediately

3121.359 --> 3124.359
right

3130.96 --> 3136.52
what does that have to do with arwenian

3132.88 --> 3136.52
geometry ralph

3148.48 --> 3153.599
why does the mechanic no it doesn't

3150.559 --> 3156.559
shadow government you're a liar

3153.599 --> 3160.7200000000003
mechanical gyroscopes don't drift

3156.559 --> 3163.0400000000004
only ring laser gyroscopes do that

3160.72 --> 3163.04
yeah

3163.76 --> 3166.76
so

3167.119 --> 3172.079
you're a liar i should just ban you

3169.76 --> 3176.48
right there

3172.079 --> 3178.88
because you have no reference for that

3176.48 --> 3181.92
mechanical gyroscopes don't drift

3178.88 --> 3183.76
only ring laser gyroscope strip

3181.92 --> 3186.559
could have gotten it wrong that's why

3183.76 --> 3189.2000000000003
i'm not instantly banning you

3186.559 --> 3191.28
but usually when people make straight

3189.2 --> 3195.24
out lies

3191.28 --> 3195.2400000000002
i tend to ban them

3199.44 --> 3204.4
i heard him i don't know what the [ __ ]

3201.68 --> 3204.3999999999996
you're talking about

3206.8 --> 3211.52
ring laser gyros stone proof drift right

3209.2 --> 3213.68
because it's late it's light the light

3211.52 --> 3217.28
drifts that's what ring laser gyroscopes

3213.68 --> 3217.2799999999997
prove the light drifts

3217.76 --> 3222.96
stefan we kind of got

3219.68 --> 3226.319
whatever man

3222.96 --> 3228.559
look the what a gyroscope is

3226.319 --> 3230.96
is very clear

3228.559 --> 3233.599
if somebody's going to make a mechanical

3230.96 --> 3234.839
gyroscope that supposedly drifts they're

3233.599 --> 3237.76
a

3234.839 --> 3240.5589999999997
fraud in my opinion people that try to

3237.76 --> 3242.96
do that they should have their devices

3240.559 --> 3244.88
carefully analyzed

3242.96 --> 3250.119
by people that are not

3244.88 --> 3250.119
invested in that basically but judged

3250.319 --> 3256.0
and yeah

3253.28 --> 3258.8
it should be highlighted made an example

3256.0 --> 3260.8
of like this is a liar gyroscopes can't

3258.8 --> 3263.119
do that here's the reason why

3260.8 --> 3266.2400000000002
if you build a mechan a mechanical

3263.119 --> 3269.44
device that claims it's a mechanical

3266.24 --> 3271.52
gyroscopes that drifts then that fraud

3269.44 --> 3274.16
must be unraveled

3271.52 --> 3278.2
because that can't be

3274.16 --> 3278.2
that's mechanically impossible

3282.48 --> 3286.4
he shows the whole process fine

3288.4 --> 3291.88
it can't be

3292.16 --> 3298.72
they invested in him and shunned him

3294.48 --> 3298.72
because he refused to lie what the [ __ ]

3300.16 --> 3303.44
oh so

3301.599 --> 3306.079
i don't know what you're talking about i

3303.44 --> 3308.64
just know that that can't be that's

3306.079 --> 3312.4
physically impossible

3308.64 --> 3312.4
the guy has to be a fraud

3314.079 --> 3317.92
i'd say freaking sue him

3318.079 --> 3323.44
he has no backing for that he has to be

3321.04 --> 3324.72
a liar there's no

3323.44 --> 3328.16
other

3324.72 --> 3330.72
possibility he must be a liar gyroscopes

3328.16 --> 3335.839
mechanical gyroscopes don't drift

3330.72 --> 3335.839
so either he builds it flawed on purpose

3337.04 --> 3340.88
or it just didn't happen at all and he

3338.64 --> 3344.5589999999997
made it up

3340.88 --> 3345.599
has to be a fraud cannot be it's just a

3344.559 --> 3348.6400000000003
fact

3345.599 --> 3351.28
like i will literally bet my life on it

3348.64 --> 3353.92
my literal life

3351.28 --> 3356.7200000000003
that he must be a fraud

3353.92 --> 3359.76
cannot be mechanical gyroscopes don't

3356.72 --> 3361.839
drift they don't they never do if they

3359.76 --> 3363.8390000000004
did

3361.839 --> 3366.16
the world could not function the way it

3363.839 --> 3368.16
does

3366.16 --> 3368.96
machinery could not function the way it

3368.16 --> 3371.44
does

3368.96 --> 3374.2400000000002
it has to be a fraud i don't even want

3371.44 --> 3377.839
to look into it i know it has to be i

3374.24 --> 3381.68
would literally pay my life if i was

3377.839 --> 3381.68
wrong and i know i'm not

3382.079 --> 3384.6400000000003
otherwise i wouldn't say something like

3383.68 --> 3387.2
that

3384.64 --> 3390.839
it has to be a fraud

3387.2 --> 3390.839
it's physically impossible

3393.599 --> 3399.119
okay okay indeed

3396.799 --> 3401.7599999999998
so yeah any of you guys in chat if you

3399.119 --> 3404.4
want to go after that look that guy up i

3401.76 --> 3407.3590000000004
don't even want to do that i know

3404.4 --> 3410.559
what i'm talking about i literally

3407.359 --> 3412.88
i will pay my life i would pull put my

3410.559 --> 3414.2400000000002
head on a chopping block and have it cut

3412.88 --> 3416.799
off

3414.24 --> 3419.2
without flinching

3416.799 --> 3421.119
if gyroscopes would naturally drift if

3419.2 --> 3424.0
they were built correctly

3421.119 --> 3427.2400000000002
mechanical gyroscopes did that

3424.0 --> 3427.24
they don't

3437.839 --> 3440.839
ugh

3467.04 --> 3472.48
yeah well matthew just

3469.92 --> 3476.16
does yeah

3472.48 --> 3479.92
watch the video and just know it has to

3476.16 --> 3479.92
be a fraud there's no other way

3480.319 --> 3483.52
he's

3481.2 --> 3486.24
probably a pretty high freaking level

3483.52 --> 3488.64
wizard to even attempt something like

3486.24 --> 3491.2
that it has to be rumpus level

3488.64 --> 3493.359
so he's a real sick devious bastard he

3491.2 --> 3495.839
has to be

3493.359 --> 3499.359
because mechanical gyroscopes don't

3495.839 --> 3499.359
drift if they did

3500.0 --> 3505.2
we could not use them

3502.72 --> 3507.839
yeah we could not use mechanical

3505.2 --> 3508.64
gyroscopes or any gyroscopes

3507.839 --> 3512.0789999999997
in

3508.64 --> 3513.92
in airplanes in boats

3512.079 --> 3516.4
we wouldn't be able to use them if

3513.92 --> 3518.64
mechanical gyroscopes drift

3516.4 --> 3520.88
they don't they can't

3518.64 --> 3524.1189999999997
the man has to be a fraud there's no

3520.88 --> 3524.119
other way

3535.28 --> 3538.28
so

3570.88 --> 3577.48
uh

3573.44 --> 3577.48
that's right jeff gas head

3591.68 --> 3594.68
right

3610.64 --> 3615.839
i think this [ __ ] just literally made

3612.799 --> 3615.839
this up

3712.799 --> 3716.68
so anything else

3763.2 --> 3769.839
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

3765.68 --> 3769.839
god you guys are so unbearable

3772.0 --> 3775.68
what's

3773.039 --> 3777.039
what is supposedly disproved in behind

3775.68 --> 3779.5989999999997
the curve

3777.039 --> 3781.5200000000004
like behind the curve didn't disprove

3779.599 --> 3783.839
anything

3781.52 --> 3787.28
it was purely writing

3783.839 --> 3791.799
on really terrible editing

3787.28 --> 3793.3590000000004
and temporary misconceptions

3791.799 --> 3796.4
misconceptions

3793.359 --> 3798.88
right it was an early stage thing it was

3796.4 --> 3801.119
way before

3798.88 --> 3803.76
we all figured out what's mechanically

3801.119 --> 3805.28
actually going on about the horizon not

3803.76 --> 3807.6800000000003
being earth curve

3805.28 --> 3809.6800000000003
it was even before that

3807.68 --> 3811.7599999999998
it's pointless it

3809.68 --> 3815.2799999999997
what they were doing was outdated

3811.76 --> 3817.8390000000004
testing it didn't prove or disprove

3815.28 --> 3817.8390000000004
anything

3820.64 --> 3826.64
the movie is pointless

3824.079 --> 3829.6800000000003
it's completely pointless the only

3826.64 --> 3831.7599999999998
useful aspect about it is that people

3829.68 --> 3835.7599999999998
get to hear about flat earth even if

3831.76 --> 3837.6800000000003
it's in a ridiculous misrepresented way

3835.76 --> 3840.079
and that's it

3837.68 --> 3841.359
right in this day and age i bet that's a

3840.079 --> 3844.48
good thing

3841.359 --> 3848.48
because if general public would see how

3844.48 --> 3851.039
flat earthers are being misrepresented

3848.48 --> 3852.4
they'd immediately think that oh that

3851.039 --> 3855.039
means they're right

3852.4 --> 3856.119
because this [ __ ] world

3855.039 --> 3859.6800000000003
lies

3856.119 --> 3861.039
180 degrees about everything they do

3859.68 --> 3864.0789999999997
everything

3861.039 --> 3868.0
yeah that's the only good thing about

3864.079 --> 3870.4
behind the curve is that people are so

3868.0 --> 3872.72
so done with this double speaking [ __ ]

3870.4 --> 3875.599
world where everything is a lie

3872.72 --> 3876.8799999999997
that they'll just notice like oh

3875.599 --> 3878.6400000000003
i guess

3876.88 --> 3880.48
that the earth is flat because

3878.64 --> 3882.0
everything this [ __ ] movie is doing

3880.48 --> 3884.64
is just trying to make them look

3882.0 --> 3886.079
ridiculous

3884.64 --> 3887.839
so

3886.079 --> 3889.8390000000004
yeah there's there's other things in the

3887.839 --> 3893.68
world with which that is happening as

3889.839 --> 3896.5589999999997
well and they know it's a lie with that

3893.68 --> 3896.5589999999997
so yeah

3899.2 --> 3902.52
that's it

3910.96 --> 3915.079
i almost made all that noise

3929.119 --> 3932.4
yo where is everybody

3933.039 --> 3937.119
my chat's been signed for three straight

3935.599 --> 3940.92
minutes

3937.119 --> 3940.92
where did you guys go

3962.64 --> 3965.839
all right all right

3973.359 --> 3981.52
yeah good to see you guys here it's

3976.839 --> 3981.52
just i'm gonna get this grapefruit juice

3998.48 --> 4002.4
did i just wear out all the trolls

4004.24 --> 4010.7599999999998
or maybe they just tried to find another

4006.88 --> 4010.76
place to squirt again

4020.64 --> 4023.64
uh

4041.119 --> 4045.6800000000003
what i was what was i even talking about

4043.2 --> 4049.839
before they got in

4045.68 --> 4049.839
they have successfully distracted me

4090.48 --> 4092.88
right

4101.44 --> 4105.919999999999
hey refract curvature good to see you

4109.12 --> 4112.64
are you guys finally done with the skype

4111.04 --> 4116.679
call

4112.64 --> 4116.679
oh yeah for a while

4118.799 --> 4124.0
oh yeah why are there's internet beyond

4120.64 --> 4124.0
antarctica yeah yeah

4124.08 --> 4128.3189999999995
well it would look

4126.799 --> 4130.839
if there's something like beyond

4128.319 --> 4133.92
antarctica and there's like non-icy

4130.839 --> 4136.08
lands i mean yeah

4133.92 --> 4139.6
you don't need wireless for that like i

4136.08 --> 4141.199
do that wired it's just for the icy part

4139.6 --> 4143.359
a wireless

4141.199 --> 4144.799
connector would be more efficient than

4143.359 --> 4147.799
some kind of a

4144.799 --> 4147.799
cable

4147.839 --> 4151.12
because that would just get damaged from

4149.44 --> 4152.4
all the frost

4151.12 --> 4154.239
but like

4152.4 --> 4156.5599999999995
in the region where it's

4154.239 --> 4157.5199999999995
yeah where the internet is being used

4156.56 --> 4159.839000000001
like

4157.52 --> 4161.759
not just wireless everywhere although

4159.839 --> 4164.159
maybe it all depends on how crowded it

4161.759 --> 4164.159
is but

4172.4 --> 4175.839
oh god

4182.96 --> 4189.839
beyond antarctica yeah

4185.199 --> 4189.839
beyond antarctica that's right

4199.36 --> 4203.0
hey adam price

4220.239 --> 4223.36
yeah yeah i'm doing great

4227.28 --> 4231.84
decently rested this time

4234.8 --> 4241.04
oh really important like

4237.679 --> 4244.84
yeah because of the paypal donation from

4241.04 --> 4244.84
tony whitcomb and

4252.96 --> 4255.199
right

4256.719 --> 4260.4
yeah that really helped me out because

4258.56 --> 4261.4400000000005
like one of the things that i really

4260.4 --> 4264.719
needed

4261.44 --> 4266.639999999999
was to basically refresh my oil

4264.719 --> 4268.159
for my fries

4266.64 --> 4270.64
because if you keep

4268.159 --> 4273.44
using the same oil for too long it it

4270.64 --> 4276.64
kind of becomes

4273.44 --> 4276.639999999999
not so good and

4277.04 --> 4280.48
and yeah but yeah if you don't have the

4279.04 --> 4282.719
money

4280.48 --> 4285.28
for a new yeah then

4282.719 --> 4287.12
what are you gonna do

4285.28 --> 4290.08
so i was just really happy to replace

4287.12 --> 4293.199
those oils

4290.08 --> 4294.96
and it does really feel a lot better

4293.199 --> 4299.32
like my body

4294.96 --> 4299.32
is very thankful i did that

4334.32 --> 4338.48
yeah in the meantime the chat's been

4336.08 --> 4338.48
kind of

4340.32 --> 4344.96
visited by some typical

4342.719 --> 4347.679
baller numpties that like to hang around

4344.96 --> 4347.679
in chats and

4348.08 --> 4353.28
do their thing and i guess you guys are

4350.4 --> 4353.28
just going at it

4353.92 --> 4358.88
i already addressed some

4357.12 --> 4361.199
but yeah they just got their gunning

4358.88 --> 4363.92
it's just

4361.199 --> 4366.239
like their tactic is to literally just

4363.92 --> 4370.4400000000005
make you fall to sleep because they're

4366.239 --> 4370.44
so annoying and boring

4371.92 --> 4377.6
they're they just want their dementia to

4374.96 --> 4379.92
rub off on you so you can be a [ __ ]

4377.6 --> 4382.400000000001
[ __ ] too and they don't feel like such

4379.92 --> 4385.6
a [ __ ] [ __ ] anymore

4382.4 --> 4386.639999999999
that's really it that's what they do

4385.6 --> 4389.92
they just

4386.64 --> 4394.280000000001
want you to be [ __ ] like them so

4389.92 --> 4394.28
they don't feel like such a [ __ ]

4421.52 --> 4424.320000000001
yeah

4422.719 --> 4426.4800000000005
yeah the yarn

4424.32 --> 4426.48
where

4426.88 --> 4430.88
that's hilarious where did you find that

4438.4 --> 4443.759999999999
don't remember ever haven't ever having

4440.56 --> 4443.76
seen that one before

4444.719 --> 4451.2390000000005
oh yeah i see it now huh

4448.239 --> 4451.239
hilarious

4466.32 --> 4472.239
yeah no it's it's

4468.56 --> 4474.96
just be glad that you're not like that

4472.239 --> 4478.718999999999
i mean i think that

4474.96 --> 4480.2390000000005
some teenagers are kind of like that

4478.719 --> 4482.2390000000005
right

4480.239 --> 4485.759999999999
and isn't that just the universal

4482.239 --> 4489.199
western problem is that so many people

4485.76 --> 4489.1990000000005
they just don't grow up

4489.44 --> 4494.32
they keep using the petty tactics that

4493.199 --> 4496.0
they did

4494.32 --> 4497.759999999999
when they were a little kid because that

4496.0 --> 4500.08
worked that gave them some sense of

4497.76 --> 4502.88
temporary power people actually just

4500.08 --> 4505.44
fell in line for that for a while they

4502.88 --> 4506.719
probably even thought that these

4505.44 --> 4510.678999999999
numpties

4506.719 --> 4510.679
were supposedly smart

4510.719 --> 4514.4
and that's it they're just trying to get

4512.719 --> 4516.08
that back

4514.4 --> 4518.96
they just want to feel like they're

4516.08 --> 4520.64
smart again even though they're provably

4518.96 --> 4522.719
they're probably not

4520.64 --> 4524.8
and they're just not willing to let it

4522.719 --> 4526.159
go and just move on

4524.8 --> 4530.0
do something constructive with their

4526.159 --> 4530.0
life no they just have to reaffirm

4530.159 --> 4533.839999999999
that position that they can't attain

4532.08 --> 4536.32
anymore because nobody's buying it

4533.84 --> 4539.28
anymore

4536.32 --> 4540.32
right only other people just as terrible

4539.28 --> 4541.84
as you

4540.32 --> 4545.12
because when you're a teen and you're

4541.84 --> 4547.76
acting like that yeah you

4545.12 --> 4549.679
just regular kids that aren't bad they

4547.76 --> 4551.12
will be fooled by it and they'll be like

4549.679 --> 4553.4400000000005
oh okay okay

4551.12 --> 4555.44
that's kind of cool isn't it but when

4553.44 --> 4558.639999999999
the only people saying you know okay

4555.44 --> 4560.0
okay are just as terrible

4558.64 --> 4562.320000000001
as you

4560.0 --> 4565.04
yeah that's not so super pleasant that

4562.32 --> 4568.08
it makes things worse it's just like

4565.04 --> 4571.76
yeah your peers they suck don't they

4568.08 --> 4573.12
these people they really suck

4571.76 --> 4576.96
doesn't work

4573.12 --> 4576.96
anymore like when you were a teen

4577.28 --> 4580.8
you can't get that back you need to get

4579.52 --> 4582.8
over it

4580.8 --> 4584.320000000001
you need to be honest about yourself

4582.8 --> 4586.0
what you're really good at and what

4584.32 --> 4587.759999999999
you're not so good at

4586.0 --> 4590.64
you need to

4587.76 --> 4593.92
bite the bullet

4590.64 --> 4595.92
of pain of realizing that you were

4593.92 --> 4598.4
fooled and you were very good at

4595.92 --> 4600.4800000000005
managing being fooled with the rest of

4598.4 --> 4603.04
them the kids yeah

4600.48 --> 4606.08
but you're supposedly an adult now you

4603.04 --> 4609.56
should not be wasting your time with

4606.08 --> 4609.5599999999995
that anymore

4618.48 --> 4625.36
what are my thoughts on online gambling

4622.8 --> 4625.360000000001
stupid

4626.0 --> 4630.0
all gambling is kind of stupid

4632.48 --> 4637.599999999999
i mean especially did look gambling is

4635.52 --> 4640.96
already hazardous enough in the sense

4637.6 --> 4642.159000000001
that like a really good

4640.96 --> 4643.44
tricker

4642.159 --> 4646.0
trickster

4643.44 --> 4648.239
could just fool with you right but i'm

4646.0 --> 4651.04
like i would never gamble

4648.239 --> 4652.959999999999
like it digitally like you don't even

4651.04 --> 4655.5199999999995
know what's going on there you don't

4652.96 --> 4657.52
even get to see the mechanics it's just

4655.52 --> 4659.1990000000005
a bunch of things like oh yeah you just

4657.52 --> 4660.88
have to trust it

4659.199 --> 4662.839999999999
it's like a slot machine they can do

4660.88 --> 4665.76
whatever the [ __ ] they want with

4662.84 --> 4668.0
it i mean if i'm gonna gamble or

4665.76 --> 4670.56
something then at least i wanna see the

4668.0 --> 4673.04
physical things that i'm doing it with

4670.56 --> 4673.04
you know

4674.719 --> 4680.159
unless you don't mind just pouring money

4677.44 --> 4682.5599999999995
into a black hole just to be sort of

4680.159 --> 4684.879999999999
entertained and then yeah but i don't

4682.56 --> 4686.8
know i'd rather than just play some

4684.88 --> 4689.6
stupid video game

4686.8 --> 4692.0
that just says pay me money

4689.6 --> 4694.2390000000005
and then whatever right at least it's

4692.0 --> 4696.32
only honest about yeah it's gonna be

4694.239 --> 4700.32
wasted your money but it is gonna pay

4696.32 --> 4705.28
for the programmers i guess a bit

4700.32 --> 4706.88
that's more honest like online gambling

4705.28 --> 4709.28
no

4706.88 --> 4713.36
i mean i guess some people

4709.28 --> 4713.36
think that they can get money out of it

4718.56 --> 4721.84
i

4719.44 --> 4721.839999999999
know

4734.8 --> 4739.4400000000005
isn't youtube a black hole for entertain

4737.12 --> 4740.48
no no it's not the same thing

4739.44 --> 4741.839999999999
yeah

4740.48 --> 4744.799999999999
you don't

4741.84 --> 4746.56
throw super chats or whatever

4744.8 --> 4748.88
to people

4746.56 --> 4750.64
because you expect to get a profit out

4748.88 --> 4753.28
of it yeah

4750.64 --> 4755.280000000001
that's different

4753.28 --> 4758.239
if it's entertainment it's entertainment

4755.28 --> 4760.719
that's just honest it's like yeah

4758.239 --> 4763.12
does this do something for you are you

4760.719 --> 4764.4800000000005
getting something out of this a sense of

4763.12 --> 4766.239
like belonging

4764.48 --> 4768.159
maybe you like the people that hang

4766.239 --> 4770.08
around here maybe you have some things

4768.159 --> 4773.44
you want to talk about

4770.08 --> 4777.84
yeah that's honest

4773.44 --> 4777.839999999999
it's not a black hole that's actually

4779.44 --> 4784.4
a system it's

4781.92 --> 4785.1990000000005
it's a craft it's

4784.4 --> 4787.759999999999
yeah

4785.199 --> 4790.4
something you can get something out

4787.76 --> 4792.4800000000005
right it's not online gambling

4790.4 --> 4794.32
online gambling that suggests like oh

4792.48 --> 4796.239
you could make a profit out of it that's

4794.32 --> 4797.92
gambling addiction yeah

4796.239 --> 4800.879999999999
youtube

4797.92 --> 4804.36
social media even that's not like that

4800.88 --> 4804.36
it's not the same

4812.88 --> 4817.719
digital theft what the [ __ ]

4824.88 --> 4831.08
well what do i think about theft it's

4827.36 --> 4831.08
theft it's terrible

4831.84 --> 4836.719
i mean

4834.08 --> 4840.5599999999995
if something somebody stole some like

4836.719 --> 4843.12
your bike or whatever or your car

4840.56 --> 4845.04
is that really much worse than literally

4843.12 --> 4847.84
stealing somebody's identity and then

4845.04 --> 4847.84
billing them

4867.52 --> 4873.280000000001
is that gambling turret 306 yeah yeah

4870.32 --> 4873.28
that is gambling

4888.08 --> 4892.08
cool paste what

4890.239 --> 4896.48
what the [ __ ] are you talking about from

4892.08 --> 4898.88
the grave you think google pays taxes

4896.48 --> 4903.0
are you [ __ ] me

4898.88 --> 4903.0
are you that ill-informed

4904.239 --> 4909.36
like

4905.36 --> 4910.96
google is like one of the lowest tax

4909.36 --> 4914.48
sources

4910.96 --> 4916.88
of all mega corporations they

4914.48 --> 4919.599999999999
are big because they barely pay any

4916.88 --> 4919.6
taxes that's

4920.08 --> 4924.159
this is ridiculous

4921.6 --> 4925.92
i don't i don't know if google pays any

4924.159 --> 4930.08
taxes

4925.92 --> 4932.56
i mean people that make money on youtube

4930.08 --> 4934.639
pay taxes right you have to pay your

4932.56 --> 4936.4800000000005
income tax or whatever especially if

4934.639 --> 4938.4800000000005
you're american

4936.48 --> 4939.36
sure

4938.48 --> 4942.48
but

4939.36 --> 4945.04
google itself with their profits

4942.48 --> 4947.36
really they pa they

4945.04 --> 4949.44
pay money to the government they have

4947.36 --> 4950.159
taxes i don't know i don't know if they

4949.44 --> 4952.159
do

4950.159 --> 4954.5599999999995
i mean they probably should

4952.159 --> 4955.5199999999995
but i don't think they do it was a whole

4954.56 --> 4956.56
issue

4955.52 --> 4958.719
remember

4956.56 --> 4962.320000000001
at least a decade ago that was like

4958.719 --> 4965.76
outrageous how they didn't pay any taxes

4962.32 --> 4968.239
yet they kept like grasping up jobs

4965.76 --> 4970.08
and all that like

4968.239 --> 4972.718999999999
and because they don't pay any taxes

4970.08 --> 4974.08
nobody really gets anything out of it

4972.719 --> 4976.32
so i don't know where you're getting

4974.08 --> 4976.32
that

4981.28 --> 4986.0
it's like every time you say something

4983.6 --> 4989.84
from the grave every time you say

4986.0 --> 4989.84
something you're wrong

4990.4 --> 4994.239
you're literally a zombie from the grave

4993.199 --> 4996.719
everything

4994.239 --> 5000.638999999999
you've been saying is wrong

4996.719 --> 5002.639
how do you do that

5000.639 --> 5005.28
i mean

5002.639 --> 5008.08
is that your mission to just be wrong

5005.28 --> 5010.48
about every single [ __ ] thing you say

5008.08 --> 5012.32
is that your life's mission just be

5010.48 --> 5015.839999999999
wrong about everything

5012.32 --> 5015.84
is that your life

5020.48 --> 5025.28
oh and they would all please

5023.28 --> 5028.08
there you go again he doesn't know what

5025.28 --> 5030.0
the [ __ ] he's talking about

5028.08 --> 5032.8
they would yeah yeah

5030.0 --> 5035.04
the employees

5032.8 --> 5037.76
yeah the people

5035.04 --> 5038.56
and their income yeah

5037.76 --> 5043.12
not

5038.56 --> 5045.52
google you stupid [ __ ]

5043.12 --> 5048.32
you think the corporation that that's

5045.52 --> 5050.400000000001
the corporation people working

5048.32 --> 5052.32
for the company having income having to

5050.4 --> 5055.5199999999995
pay tax you think that that is the

5052.32 --> 5058.08
company do you

5055.52 --> 5061.040000000001
do you know anything do you know how

5058.08 --> 5063.84
anything works like how [ __ ] old are

5061.04 --> 5065.76
you man are you literally 12 at this

5063.84 --> 5068.639
point i'd not be surprised if you were

5065.76 --> 5070.8
literally a 12 year old snotty little

5068.639 --> 5073.6
piece of [ __ ]

5070.8 --> 5077.2390000000005
do you know anything from the grave

5073.6 --> 5077.2390000000005
anything at all

5122.239 --> 5127.48
no i don't know what that means max

5144.08 --> 5147.639
what does that mean

5158.56 --> 5164.88
all right

5159.76 --> 5164.88
good to see you okay okay great

5166.56 --> 5170.92
yeah yeah i got it i got it

5183.679 --> 5187.88
never been a big fan of shorts

5200.32 --> 5202.639
right

5204.32 --> 5209.32
thank you

5205.52 --> 5209.320000000001
i appreciate that

5222.88 --> 5227.28
hmm

5224.48 --> 5227.28
getting hungry

5228.96 --> 5234.2390000000005
i think i might ran out and show

5230.96 --> 5234.2390000000005
somewhere in the next few minutes

5234.96 --> 5241.56
i think i wore out

5237.76 --> 5241.56
the numpty as well

5258.48 --> 5261.48
hmm

5273.199 --> 5278.48
can i tell you about the planes beyond

5276.159 --> 5280.719
what

5278.48 --> 5284.799999999999
i don't know

5280.719 --> 5285.84
much about it i just know that there's

5284.8 --> 5287.360000000001
been

5285.84 --> 5288.96
accounts

5287.36 --> 5291.36
that basically

5288.96 --> 5291.36
like the

5291.52 --> 5297.280000000001
admiral bird talked about it

5295.199 --> 5299.199
so that's one reference and yeah it's

5297.28 --> 5300.639
just one right but

5299.199 --> 5302.5599999999995
there's other

5300.639 --> 5304.8
just signals

5302.56 --> 5306.96
rumors i guess

5304.8 --> 5309.76
over the years that

5306.96 --> 5314.8
there is some kind of inhabitable land

5309.76 --> 5317.76
somewhere beyond the antarctic region

5314.8 --> 5319.84
or like yeah however you see what the

5317.76 --> 5320.84
the orientation of all that is maybe

5319.84 --> 5324.88
like

5320.84 --> 5327.52
inside like at the center whatever

5324.88 --> 5327.52
there's some

5328.719 --> 5333.52
not frozen land

5330.96 --> 5335.04
that's very close to antarctica that's

5333.52 --> 5337.4400000000005
not like on

5335.04 --> 5340.76
our side

5337.44 --> 5340.759999999999
of the ocean

5350.239 --> 5354.239
i think there was even like a photograph

5352.4 --> 5356.32
made of it

5354.239 --> 5358.799999999999
but yeah that would have been just one

5356.32 --> 5360.88
oh hey thank you vex

5358.8 --> 5362.96
buy something you need ah

5360.88 --> 5365.84
well that's not really gonna work now is

5362.96 --> 5365.84
it

5366.56 --> 5368.639
because

5367.52 --> 5372.400000000001
yeah that's

5368.639 --> 5372.400000000001
super chat it doesn't work

5373.12 --> 5377.44
but thank you for the gesture

5375.92 --> 5380.4
if you really want to support me then

5377.44 --> 5382.159
please do it through the paypal

5380.4 --> 5385.36
because then i get

5382.159 --> 5389.28
most of it and i get it quickly

5385.36 --> 5389.28
super chess they just kind of end up

5390.239 --> 5395.36
like not in my pocket but thank you

5392.96 --> 5395.36
anyway

5399.92 --> 5403.28
interesting yeah it is interesting

5401.84 --> 5404.84
shadow govt

5403.28 --> 5407.28
i know it is

5404.84 --> 5410.159000000001
interesting but there's not really too

5407.28 --> 5410.159
much to talk about

5410.88 --> 5417.1990000000005
just that there is it's been suggested

5413.679 --> 5417.1990000000005
that there is land beyond it

5418.88 --> 5424.0
by the way which would absolutely be

5421.04 --> 5427.679
impossible on a bald earth

5424.0 --> 5430.08
doesn't fit doesn't fit the ball right

5427.679 --> 5433.28
doesn't fit in that model it's very easy

5430.08 --> 5436.4
though for us because it's not a ball

5433.28 --> 5438.159
and we don't know the entire expanse of

5436.4 --> 5439.599999999999
the available

5438.159 --> 5442.159
room

5439.6 --> 5444.88
that this rain realm contains we don't

5442.159 --> 5448.08
know how far it goes

5444.88 --> 5450.639
there could be entire realm segments

5448.08 --> 5452.88
beyond antarctica i've theorized about

5450.639 --> 5455.52
this and even draw pictures

5452.88 --> 5457.679
a lot of times

5455.52 --> 5458.4800000000005
i'm very much about

5457.679 --> 5460.719
that

5458.48 --> 5465.12
model

5460.719 --> 5465.12
because the rectangular looping model

5465.28 --> 5469.759999999999
yeah it's very easy to basically click

5468.4 --> 5472.32
on

5469.76 --> 5473.1990000000005
the the option or the potential for

5472.32 --> 5477.679
other

5473.199 --> 5479.599999999999
entire realms like as big as our own

5477.679 --> 5481.36
to be south

5479.6 --> 5483.52
of antarctica

5481.36 --> 5485.92
and maybe even north

5483.52 --> 5488.0
beyond the north pole what we

5485.92 --> 5492.2390000000005
think of as the north pole

5488.0 --> 5492.239
could be an entire realm beyond there

5494.239 --> 5497.759999999999
then there is suggestion of that even

5496.88 --> 5500.8
there's

5497.76 --> 5502.0
yeah stories and they're just stories of

5500.8 --> 5505.360000000001
course

5502.0 --> 5509.28
stories of people supposedly going there

5505.36 --> 5512.0
and traveling into unknown regions

5509.28 --> 5512.0
and yeah

5512.08 --> 5518.36
that none of that fits on the ball earth

5514.88 --> 5518.36
none of it does

5524.239 --> 5528.4
all right bex and that's cool

5526.719 --> 5530.719
thank you

5528.4 --> 5532.4
i am okay if you want to use me to test

5530.719 --> 5534.88
if the super chat works that's all

5532.4 --> 5534.879999999999
that's fine

5539.04 --> 5542.32
damn the wind is blowing

5542.639 --> 5545.639
poof

5547.36 --> 5553.0
yeah

5549.28 --> 5553.0
can you hear that guys

5573.199 --> 5578.159
right oh maybe you could show some of it

5584.56 --> 5589.84
dig through my pictures again

5587.679 --> 5589.84
see

5623.04 --> 5627.84
like this for example

5625.679 --> 5631.679
this is an attempt to represent in a

5627.84 --> 5634.2390000000005
rectangular looping model

5631.679 --> 5636.32
and yeah what that makes possible as to

5634.239 --> 5639.959999999999
what is beyond

5636.32 --> 5639.96
north and south

5644.719 --> 5647.199
right

5645.679 --> 5649.08
we have the equator

5647.199 --> 5651.04
down the middle and we have the

5649.08 --> 5652.88
antiquaters

5651.04 --> 5656.12
north and south because that's how that

5652.88 --> 5656.12
will work

5658.159 --> 5661.199
let's see what else

5661.28 --> 5664.88
maybe some top down view

5666.48 --> 5669.799999999999
hold on

5672.4 --> 5676.08
that's

5673.28 --> 5678.48
more fantastical representation

5676.08 --> 5681.6
oh yeah this is what i imagine it would

5678.48 --> 5683.839999999999
be like if you literally touched

5681.6 --> 5685.6
the dome if there would be any that you

5683.84 --> 5687.52
would literally just still see the

5685.6 --> 5688.719
celestials right through it but it's a

5687.52 --> 5691.040000000001
barrier

5688.719 --> 5692.88
and like all of it would still seem the

5691.04 --> 5694.239
same distance it wouldn't be like it's

5692.88 --> 5696.0
right in front of your nose it would

5694.239 --> 5697.599999999999
still be

5696.0 --> 5700.639
that distance even though there's

5697.6 --> 5703.84
literally nothing physical

5700.639 --> 5703.84
beyond that point

5704.0 --> 5707.44
right

5705.679 --> 5711.1990000000005
ah here's an oversight

5707.44 --> 5712.48
from my very first show on youtube

5711.199 --> 5714.5599999999995
all the things i

5712.48 --> 5717.04
put together back then

5714.56 --> 5717.04
ideas

5718.96 --> 5722.0
let's see what else

5726.84 --> 5734.400000000001
flying city

5729.76 --> 5734.400000000001
charging up over a pyramid

5735.28 --> 5738.8
that's another idea

5737.28 --> 5742.08
all right

5738.8 --> 5745.679
holo ring

5742.08 --> 5748.639
right here's other rectangular

5745.679 --> 5750.639
orientations

5748.639 --> 5753.6
so this would be more

5750.639 --> 5753.6
looping arc

5754.96 --> 5759.92
instead of just straight rectangular

5758.08 --> 5762.88
because this is all about how space

5759.92 --> 5765.28
connects with itself

5762.88 --> 5768.2390000000005
how does the space within the looping

5765.28 --> 5769.84
realm co interconnect we don't know with

5768.239 --> 5772.48
a hundred percent certainty i've

5769.84 --> 5774.8
speculated about this a lot

5772.48 --> 5777.839999999999
it's purely theoretical

5774.8 --> 5782.0
right and here is

5777.84 --> 5783.92
if yeah the looping beads model

5782.0 --> 5785.199
this is rectangular looping that means

5783.92 --> 5787.28
that

5785.199 --> 5788.239
every part interconnects with the other

5787.28 --> 5789.679
side

5788.239 --> 5792.239
and this is

5789.679 --> 5794.2390000000005
pretty much what a flat globe model

5792.239 --> 5796.08
would be like

5794.239 --> 5799.44
if there were other

5796.08 --> 5802.48
realm segments beyond the narrow points

5799.44 --> 5802.48
the pole points

5803.92 --> 5808.32
let's see and this is even weirder this

5806.48 --> 5809.759999999999
is like the ring within a ring within a

5808.32 --> 5811.759999999999
ring

5809.76 --> 5815.4400000000005
where literally it wouldn't spatially

5811.76 --> 5819.360000000001
even fit like what if the the equator

5815.44 --> 5821.28
actually adds up to a euclidean ring

5819.36 --> 5824.08
literal ring what if

5821.28 --> 5826.719
right that would be freaky but then

5824.08 --> 5829.199
what if you then go north

5826.719 --> 5830.8
and you literally just start measuring

5829.199 --> 5834.08
the place

5830.8 --> 5835.76
and what is inside of that

5834.08 --> 5837.76
location

5835.76 --> 5839.52
which you're going to assume is its side

5837.76 --> 5842.159000000001
because yeah it's surrounded by a ring

5839.52 --> 5843.6
but what if that space is exactly the

5842.159 --> 5845.04
same size

5843.6 --> 5847.1990000000005
despite

5845.04 --> 5851.44
being orientated like a ring yeah that

5847.199 --> 5851.44
gets really freaking surreal doesn't it

5852.639 --> 5857.1990000000005
but it could be that could be the way

5855.6 --> 5858.4800000000005
the loop

5857.199 --> 5861.759999999999
orients

5858.48 --> 5861.759999999999
we don't know with certainty

5863.6 --> 5865.92
right

5866.0 --> 5871.04
anyway

5868.0 --> 5871.04
let's get back to me

5878.639 --> 5882.8
yeah i drew them it's sketch it's a

5881.199 --> 5885.36
pencil sketch

5882.8 --> 5885.360000000001
that's right

5886.159 --> 5891.599999999999
you're gonna add palm me over that or

5888.48 --> 5893.36
did you just not pay attention yeah from

5891.6 --> 5895.04
the grave i wasn't actually really even

5893.36 --> 5897.04
talking to you

5895.04 --> 5899.6
i'm not expecting

5897.04 --> 5901.92
a person that's stuck in a 12 year old

5899.6 --> 5903.92
mind to actually pay attention to this

5901.92 --> 5906.32
kind of like special non-linear

5903.92 --> 5909.119
conceptual representations

5906.32 --> 5911.119
i know that's because that's like

5909.119 --> 5913.839999999999
really tough isn't it

5911.119 --> 5915.28
some dumb ass kid that never grew up is

5913.84 --> 5919.04
not gonna get it

5915.28 --> 5919.04
won't will they they won't

5921.199 --> 5925.04
you misunderstood what this drawing word

5923.28 --> 5927.759999999999
for yeah i know you did because you

5925.04 --> 5927.76
didn't listen

5929.76 --> 5934.08
i wasn't talking to you from the grave

5932.4 --> 5936.08
yeah

5934.08 --> 5939.04
you're not the center of this even

5936.08 --> 5941.84
though i am addressing you yeah what i

5939.04 --> 5943.679
present on my show is not for people

5941.84 --> 5945.4400000000005
like you

5943.679 --> 5948.639
i'm not trying to make it more

5945.44 --> 5951.5199999999995
comprehensible to the [ __ ] okay

5948.639 --> 5953.679
that's not what i do here

5951.52 --> 5954.719
i only assist

5953.679 --> 5957.119
people

5954.719 --> 5958.719
that actually have potential inside and

5957.119 --> 5960.48
that might think they're stupid but

5958.719 --> 5962.08
they're not

5960.48 --> 5963.839999999999
right but they've been conditioned by

5962.08 --> 5967.28
the outside world that everybody's

5963.84 --> 5969.28
stupid and then they it rubs off on them

5967.28 --> 5971.44
trying to pull them out of it you have

5969.28 --> 5973.44
people that have actual potential not

5971.44 --> 5975.36
numpties like you

5973.44 --> 5979.719
i'm not expecting you to learn from

5975.36 --> 5979.719
anything i say from the grave

6005.6 --> 6008.6
right

6019.199 --> 6023.199
right i hope that was interesting for

6021.28 --> 6025.759999999999
you guys

6023.199 --> 6028.239
it's me basically showing you the old

6025.76 --> 6030.320000000001
stuff again

6028.239 --> 6032.5599999999995
not something i typically like to do a

6030.32 --> 6032.5599999999995
lot

6033.92 --> 6037.36
because

6034.96 --> 6039.52
it does require kind of the right time

6037.36 --> 6042.48
the right energy

6039.52 --> 6044.639
so it doesn't just like oh what's this

6042.48 --> 6047.119
you know because this is like spatial

6044.639 --> 6049.6
non-linearity guys special nonlinear i'm

6047.119 --> 6052.08
not expecting everybody to be like oh

6049.6 --> 6055.4400000000005
yeah of course i get it oh yeah yeah no

6052.08 --> 6058.639
it's [ __ ] complicated okay

6055.44 --> 6060.4
it took me a while to even get to this

6058.639 --> 6062.88
point internally

6060.4 --> 6064.638999999999
that i could present it in a way that i

6062.88 --> 6066.96
thought that it's not just gonna be

6064.639 --> 6069.28
everybody thinks i'm insane right

6066.96 --> 6071.6
it's very hard to even conceptually

6069.28 --> 6074.96
represent this

6071.6 --> 6076.639
took it took a lot of energy

6074.96 --> 6078.88
but i don't really like to talk about

6076.639 --> 6082.159000000001
this day in day out it really everybody

6078.88 --> 6082.159000000001
the people have to be

6083.679 --> 6087.1990000000005
like

6085.84 --> 6089.4400000000005
it's like with

6087.199 --> 6092.48
planting crops you have to do it at the

6089.44 --> 6094.239
right moment when the soil is right

6092.48 --> 6096.799999999999
when you know the seeds are going to

6094.239 --> 6097.839999999999
spring right you don't just do it all

6096.8 --> 6099.679
the time

6097.84 --> 6102.08
you have to do it in the right time and

6099.679 --> 6104.8
it's really tough

6102.08 --> 6107.119
because yeah when things get a bit still

6104.8 --> 6108.96
then it's like right there it's like oh

6107.119 --> 6111.199
what if i throw this at them but it's

6108.96 --> 6112.96
just like yeah it's not gonna it's not

6111.199 --> 6115.199
gonna spring you know it's not gonna

6112.96 --> 6118.96
work

6115.199 --> 6121.839999999999
i thought yeah well i tried

6118.96 --> 6121.84
right now

6125.44 --> 6129.44
it could also be a complete mental

6127.36 --> 6132.599999999999
projection nothing physical at all no no

6129.44 --> 6132.599999999999
it can't

6134.56 --> 6136.719
no

6137.76 --> 6144.08
physical is there it is physical it is

6140.159 --> 6147.599999999999
physical from within this interface

6144.08 --> 6150.96
physicality is not a mental projection

6147.6 --> 6150.96
it's there that's what it is

6151.679 --> 6155.1990000000005
i mean we can reconstruct things in our

6153.84 --> 6157.1990000000005
mind

6155.199 --> 6159.759999999999
that doesn't mean that this is all a

6157.199 --> 6162.4
mental reconstruction

6159.76 --> 6164.96
what is physical is physical and it is

6162.4 --> 6166.799999999999
what it is

6164.96 --> 6168.639
it's not

6166.8 --> 6171.4400000000005
a hologram

6168.639 --> 6174.56
like the celestials are

6171.44 --> 6176.239
physical things are physical things

6174.56 --> 6179.6
they are what they are they're not

6176.239 --> 6179.599999999999
secretly something else

6182.0 --> 6186.8
all right

6182.96 --> 6189.04
however when it comes to what we are our

6186.8 --> 6191.52
consciousness our spirit

6189.04 --> 6194.56
that's another matter because we don't

6191.52 --> 6196.080000000001
just exist on the physical plane

6194.56 --> 6198.080000000001
right

6196.08 --> 6201.119
but just because we

6198.08 --> 6202.84
are not just physical

6201.119 --> 6205.44
flesh robots

6202.84 --> 6208.0
whatever does it mean that oh that means

6205.44 --> 6208.96
that everything is all woo

6208.0 --> 6211.52
no

6208.96 --> 6214.0
no you [ __ ] happy

6211.52 --> 6217.119000000001
it's still physical matter it's what

6214.0 --> 6219.36
that is just because you

6217.119 --> 6221.5199999999995
found all these incredible experiences

6219.36 --> 6224.88
doesn't mean that now everything is all

6221.52 --> 6228.400000000001
just a dream it isn't

6224.88 --> 6229.76
yeah our experience

6228.4 --> 6232.638999999999
might be

6229.76 --> 6235.360000000001
metaphorically considered as a dream

6232.639 --> 6238.400000000001
that doesn't mean physical substance in

6235.36 --> 6240.719
the physical or real world out there

6238.4 --> 6242.32
are all just a dream they might be a

6240.719 --> 6244.88
dream to us

6242.32 --> 6247.679
but it is real it is physically real

6244.88 --> 6250.32
there that is really there

6247.679 --> 6253.1990000000005
it is there without us it doesn't just

6250.32 --> 6255.04
exist because we made it up right

6253.199 --> 6259.04
it's all this

6255.04 --> 6261.28
quantum physicist mumbo jumbo blabbering

6259.04 --> 6265.44
seriously is quantum physicist mumbo

6261.28 --> 6265.44
jumbo blabbering it's [ __ ]

6266.88 --> 6271.92
it is physically there whether we are

6268.96 --> 6274.8
there to perceive it or not that's just

6271.92 --> 6277.119
a freaking fact

6274.8 --> 6281.4400000000005
and it will be there for quite a while

6277.119 --> 6281.44
after we don't exist anymore physically

6286.96 --> 6290.2390000000005
yeah

6288.719 --> 6291.36
i'm sorry i wasn't

6290.239 --> 6294.638999999999
wow you

6291.36 --> 6297.759999999999
it was a general statement

6294.639 --> 6299.36
break back don't take it too personal

6297.76 --> 6301.76
it's just that i've seen so many

6299.36 --> 6304.719
freaking hippie

6301.76 --> 6306.719
people say that [ __ ] like even 20 years

6304.719 --> 6308.719
ago okay

6306.719 --> 6310.96
it was like no

6308.719 --> 6313.679
no it's physically there

6310.96 --> 6315.84
it's not a simulation yeah

6313.679 --> 6318.56
might be simulatory

6315.84 --> 6320.400000000001
another confusing arwenian statement

6318.56 --> 6322.2390000000005
yeah simulatory

6320.4 --> 6325.759999999999
like it's designed

6322.239 --> 6328.08
as if it is all a simulation

6325.76 --> 6330.88
it's real though it's just that the

6328.08 --> 6333.92
simulation is the format

6330.88 --> 6336.56
in how it is basically manifested that

6333.92 --> 6338.88
doesn't mean it is a simulation and it's

6336.56 --> 6340.400000000001
not real it just means that simulation

6338.88 --> 6342.72
is the only

6340.4 --> 6347.2
format for reality

6342.72 --> 6347.2
[Laughter]

6359.679 --> 6363.6
quantum hippie

6361.36 --> 6363.599999999999
yeah

6378.0 --> 6382.88
yeah i'm sorry rig back i didn't mean to

6379.92 --> 6384.84
insult you or anything it's just that

6382.88 --> 6387.28
it what you said

6384.84 --> 6389.28
immediately brought on a whole bunch of

6387.28 --> 6391.759999999999
baggage

6389.28 --> 6394.8
so this is a simulation no

6391.76 --> 6397.4400000000005
it's simulatory

6394.8 --> 6400.4400000000005
it's designed

6397.44 --> 6400.44
through

6401.199 --> 6405.839999999999
simulation setup

6403.52 --> 6408.4800000000005
the mechanics are like as if it is a

6405.84 --> 6411.360000000001
simulation it is in the simulation it's

6408.48 --> 6411.36
the real thing

6411.6 --> 6414.56
right

6412.4 --> 6416.879999999999
if you're gonna then say oh but if it's

6414.56 --> 6418.400000000001
simulatory then it must be a simulation

6416.88 --> 6420.400000000001
without any proof

6418.4 --> 6423.28
yeah you know what you end up with there

6420.4 --> 6425.36
is no reality nothing

6423.28 --> 6428.96
actually exists that's what you end up

6425.36 --> 6430.719
with yeah you have no more grounding

6428.96 --> 6432.32
just because something seems like a

6430.719 --> 6433.92
simulation doesn't mean it is a

6432.32 --> 6436.5599999999995
simulation

6433.92 --> 6438.56
it just means that simulation is the

6436.56 --> 6441.88
only format

6438.56 --> 6441.88
there is

6442.56 --> 6446.400000000001
that's the way it's designed god

6444.8 --> 6451.28
designed it

6446.4 --> 6454.239
through similar simulatory elements

6451.28 --> 6456.88
it is not a simulation it's real

6454.239 --> 6459.678999999999
it he made it real

6456.88 --> 6461.76
it is real it's real for us it's real

6459.679 --> 6463.36
for our ancestors it's real for a

6461.76 --> 6464.719
progeny

6463.36 --> 6467.28
it is real

6464.719 --> 6471.36
and it's a real experience

6467.28 --> 6473.36
but it's not the only experience

6471.36 --> 6476.5199999999995
there's other realms there's other forms

6473.36 --> 6476.5199999999995
of existence

6499.92 --> 6503.92
that's right before computers nobody

6501.6 --> 6505.84
thought it was a simulation

6503.92 --> 6510.0
right

6505.84 --> 6513.28
because just because it is simulatory

6510.0 --> 6515.52
doesn't mean it is a simulation because

6513.28 --> 6517.92
a simulation by the very nature of the

6515.52 --> 6520.639
word immediately implies

6517.92 --> 6523.679
is that it's not real that it is a

6520.639 --> 6526.159000000001
reality or a sub-reality within a

6523.679 --> 6528.4800000000005
reality that's not what this is this

6526.159 --> 6531.5199999999995
physical realm

6528.48 --> 6534.638999999999
is physically real it's not a subrealm

6531.52 --> 6536.400000000001
of something else it is the physical

6534.639 --> 6538.08
realm

6536.4 --> 6541.199
yeah

6538.08 --> 6543.199
the physical plane

6541.199 --> 6545.199
hilariously enough is what it's called

6543.199 --> 6547.839999999999
in in the dungeons and dragons typical

6545.199 --> 6551.28
cosmology and that's what it is this is

6547.84 --> 6552.400000000001
the physical plane this is the

6551.28 --> 6555.5199999999995
realm

6552.4 --> 6557.679
you understand this is not a sub thingy

6555.52 --> 6560.080000000001
on somebody's computer

6557.679 --> 6561.84
it's the thing

6560.08 --> 6566.5599999999995
even to god

6561.84 --> 6569.52
whatever he exactly is outside of it

6566.56 --> 6571.52
this is the thing

6569.52 --> 6574.080000000001
even to god even to the the one that

6571.52 --> 6576.159000000001
designed it he designed it unique

6574.08 --> 6579.28
it's the thing

6576.159 --> 6582.32
it's not a simulation in some over

6579.28 --> 6584.08
reality and it's not real no this is the

6582.32 --> 6586.719
real thing

6584.08 --> 6589.04
you see this is the physical realm it is

6586.719 --> 6591.44
real just because it is simulatory

6589.04 --> 6594.0
doesn't mean it's a simulation

6591.44 --> 6598.08
it's just that simulation

6594.0 --> 6600.48
is the only structure we have

6598.08 --> 6602.719
for things or at least that seems to be

6600.48 --> 6604.159
the case for god that's the only way he

6602.719 --> 6607.199
could have designed it is through

6604.159 --> 6610.5599999999995
simulatory elements

6607.199 --> 6612.96
it's just pure logic

6610.56 --> 6612.96
anyway

6617.28 --> 6623.4
how do i know that there are seven what

6619.199 --> 6623.4
the hell does that have to do with it

6624.96 --> 6631.28
what do you think that seven heavens and

6626.719 --> 6633.92
hells are literal physical spaces

6631.28 --> 6635.84
in relation to the physical space of

6633.92 --> 6637.76
this realm where are you getting that

6635.84 --> 6640.4800000000005
from

6637.76 --> 6642.56
like i mean come on they're obviously

6640.48 --> 6646.959999999999
other dimensions

6642.56 --> 6649.1990000000005
obviously i mean come on

6646.96 --> 6651.04
like you don't have to be a genius to

6649.199 --> 6654.239
figure that out

6651.04 --> 6657.679
that it's not literally a spot

6654.239 --> 6661.959999999999
right next to the earth realm no it's

6657.679 --> 6661.96
another dimension duh

6676.0 --> 6681.599
how do i know their seven heavens and

6677.679 --> 6684.08
that how did i know that it was an idea

6681.599 --> 6686.88
at the time right it's something that go

6684.08 --> 6688.5599999999995
it's i was reifying right this is my old

6686.88 --> 6690.08
sketch you were talking about the old

6688.56 --> 6691.52
sketch

6690.08 --> 6694.8
apparently you

6691.52 --> 6696.2390000000005
looked at it for again

6694.8 --> 6698.320000000001
because yeah i had a

6696.239 --> 6699.36
realm thing with seven hells and seven

6698.32 --> 6701.04
heavens

6699.36 --> 6703.44
surrounding the earth literally

6701.04 --> 6705.599
physically above and below

6703.44 --> 6706.4
it's just an idea i don't think that at

6705.599 --> 6708.639
all

6706.4 --> 6711.119
i literally don't think that that is

6708.639 --> 6712.88
physically exactly like that

6711.119 --> 6715.92
i mean they think there i think there

6712.88 --> 6715.92
probably is a

6716.239 --> 6721.28
another part of this realm shall

6719.44 --> 6724.719
underneath

6721.28 --> 6728.159
that is physically connected

6724.719 --> 6730.96
right but if there are like multiple

6728.159 --> 6733.119
layers of realm

6730.96 --> 6735.44
above this below this then they are not

6733.119 --> 6738.719
physically connected

6735.44 --> 6742.719
they have literal non-existent space in

6738.719 --> 6745.44
between so they're not connected

6742.719 --> 6748.96
they're only going to be connected if a

6745.44 --> 6751.44
loop opens up if literally a portal

6748.96 --> 6755.04
opens up and connects them

6751.44 --> 6756.96
that's how i i for example in visualized

6755.04 --> 6759.44
how the flood might have happened a

6756.96 --> 6761.199
aquatic realm above us may have just

6759.44 --> 6763.598999999999
opened up

6761.199 --> 6768.5599999999995
by god's decree and then literally all

6763.599 --> 6771.4400000000005
that water evacuated in this realm

6768.56 --> 6774.400000000001
and then it closed up again

6771.44 --> 6776.48
and potential living inhabitants of that

6774.4 --> 6780.239
realm came with it

6776.48 --> 6780.239
the squid and fishy people

6781.76 --> 6787.119000000001
and they're wizardry

6783.76 --> 6787.84
right that was an idea

6787.119 --> 6790.96
but

6787.84 --> 6793.1990000000005
yeah i don't believe in a literal

6790.96 --> 6795.84
stacking physical realm we're not

6793.199 --> 6799.28
stacked like a bunch of boxes that's not

6795.84 --> 6799.28
physically literal

6799.92 --> 6804.52
anyway this is all getting a bit

6801.52 --> 6804.52
convoluted

6821.92 --> 6826.4800000000005
right anyway i'm gonna run out the show

6827.119 --> 6830.48
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6829.04 --> 6833.28
like this show

6830.48 --> 6836.638999999999
maybe a bit over the place

6833.28 --> 6838.639
but i still thought i was good

6836.639 --> 6840.639
really put some effort in explaining

6838.639 --> 6843.04
things even to people that probably

6840.639 --> 6846.08
aren't really worth it

6843.04 --> 6846.08
but i do it anyway

6846.159 --> 6849.598999999999
right

6847.28 --> 6851.679
so if you like this show then please

6849.599 --> 6853.599
don't forget to rogan's it up and if you

6851.679 --> 6855.52
haven't already subscribe to my channel

6862.0 --> 6867.04
please also do support me through the

6864.239 --> 6869.04
paypal patreon crypto wallet

6867.04 --> 6871.199
keep saying the crypto wall it's so it's

6869.04 --> 6873.84
so stuck in there

6871.199 --> 6875.919999999999
i can't get it out

6873.84 --> 6878.08
crypto valley super chat and the

6875.92 --> 6880.2390000000005
membership system join button

6878.08 --> 6884.159
that would be much appreciated and i

6880.239 --> 6886.239
could still use it i mean yeah

6884.159 --> 6888.719
i mean the big donation gave me it fixed

6886.239 --> 6891.839999999999
my situation but it's not over yet

6888.719 --> 6894.0
i can always use more i still have debts

6891.84 --> 6896.0
that i really want to get rid of so

6894.0 --> 6898.239
please keep the support coming

6896.0 --> 6899.28
that will be great oh flutter sage yeah

6898.239 --> 6901.44
you're late

6899.28 --> 6903.28
you're late

6901.44 --> 6904.5599999999995
it was a good show though so maybe worth

6903.28 --> 6906.719
watching back

6904.56 --> 6910.080000000001
anyway i'll be back tomorrow with flat

6906.719 --> 6911.04
earth early bird number 1190

6910.08 --> 6913.76
on

6911.04 --> 6916.48
the sunday show

6913.76 --> 6918.0
so yeah i hope to see you all there

6916.48 --> 6919.119
yeah there's no ball busters this

6918.0 --> 6922.48
evening i'm

6919.119 --> 6924.4
certain because there was last week

6922.48 --> 6926.959999999999
maybe still seeing you see you around in

6924.4 --> 6929.119
chats or fed premieres i hope nathan's

6926.96 --> 6930.08
going to play a good one

6929.119 --> 6932.639
and

6930.08 --> 6935.54
yeah until the next video

6932.639 --> 6966.779
keep it flat

6935.54 --> 6966.7789999999995
[Music]

6995.44 --> 6997.5199999999995
