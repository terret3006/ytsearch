so yeah it looks like yes

94.159 --> 98.159
exactly the same weather as yesterday

99.04 --> 104.56
just slight breeze

102.079 --> 106.96
no but not very

104.56 --> 110.32000000000001
not very hard but yeah it is cold

106.96 --> 110.32
outside as predicted

112.32 --> 118.39899999999999
this doesn't look very interesting

116.079 --> 118.39899999999999
all right

123.28 --> 128.36
okay

125.36 --> 128.36
right

129.599 --> 135.44
hello elise g first in chat cleary m

133.44 --> 137.84
daniel robles

135.44 --> 139.92
bill nye the science denier yeah good to

137.84 --> 143.04
see you all

139.92 --> 146.67999999999998
it is friday the 10th of

143.04 --> 146.67999999999998
december 2021

149.2 --> 152.16
can you imagine that

152.239 --> 157.64000000000001
three more weeks and it's 2022

158.239 --> 163.56
this year has

159.599 --> 163.56
been flying by

170.08 --> 173.36
right so

171.84 --> 175.84
yeah sorry for starting a little late

173.36 --> 178.16000000000003
it's it's kind of been come a habit of

175.84 --> 178.16
mine

179.84 --> 184.959
i really do

181.36 --> 187.519
try to get on time every time

184.959 --> 190.4
but sometimes it's weird sometimes i'm

187.519 --> 193.12
like too early in my preparation

190.4 --> 195.519
and then i'm waiting getting nervous

193.12 --> 197.36
from the waiting because i that's i

195.519 --> 199.84
don't like that i really have to time in

197.36 --> 199.84
well

200.959 --> 205.84
and sometimes it just i

203.599 --> 207.67999999999998
get distracted one thing by another and

205.84 --> 210.31900000000002
then it just

207.68 --> 210.31900000000002
turns out

210.879 --> 217.51899999999998
to take like 15 or 20 minutes longer

214.879 --> 217.51899999999998
but oh well

218.08 --> 221.76000000000002
at least

219.519 --> 224.64000000000001
got a lot of people in

221.76 --> 224.64
very quickly

225.28 --> 230.08
right

227.12 --> 233.04
so yeah yesterday

230.08 --> 233.04000000000002
was interesting

233.68 --> 237.59900000000002
it's a very good flat earth debates

237.84 --> 243.84
uh i don't know if the guy came in

241.92 --> 245.76
didn't he come in

243.84 --> 247.68
uh effie pilot if he still came in

245.76 --> 249.67999999999998
during the live show or if he appeared

247.68 --> 250.48000000000002
during the after show i'm not entirely

249.68 --> 252.64000000000001
sure

250.48 --> 255.84
but yeah that went on pretty much until

252.64 --> 255.83999999999997
the end of the show

256.4 --> 261.67999999999995
and it lasted a while

258.959 --> 265.04
but it was hilarious

261.68 --> 267.12
very typical anti-flat earther

265.04 --> 269.44
alright also yeah brian's

267.12 --> 272.0
uploaded a video

269.44 --> 273.44
origin of the nautical mile mitchell

272.0 --> 275.44
mirrored it

273.44 --> 277.52
because it's a very informative short

275.44 --> 279.6
little video

277.52 --> 284.88
about the origin of the nautical mile

279.6 --> 284.88
how it's directly based on the celestial

285.12 --> 287.919
minutes

286.16 --> 291.6
i think

287.919 --> 293.35999999999996
anyway it's a celestial derivative so

291.6 --> 294.8
brian made that

293.36 --> 297.759
clear

294.8 --> 299.84000000000003
i'm still kind of like letting that

297.759 --> 301.28000000000003
piece of information

299.84 --> 304.4
integrate

301.28 --> 306.63899999999995
to my wider understanding

304.4 --> 306.63899999999995
uh

308.32 --> 313.12
woke up early anticipated my boots

310.479 --> 315.44
delivered oh okay cleary

313.12 --> 316.639
right well i actually went to bed really

315.44 --> 318.96
early

316.639 --> 320.96000000000004
one o'clock

318.96 --> 324.56
i hit the shower and then went to bed

320.96 --> 328.15999999999997
really early but yeah

324.56 --> 328.16
i just slept a lot

330.8 --> 334.40000000000003
it must have been together like

336.16 --> 339.639
11 hours

340.639 --> 346.88
and had a lot of dreams like a lot i had

343.199 --> 346.88
a whole like weird

347.28 --> 352.79999999999995
forest see like there's a new landscape

350.08 --> 355.68
starting to form in my dreams

352.8 --> 358.639
where i typically go

355.68 --> 360.8
it's interesting how that works

358.639 --> 363.6
let's talk about dreams a little bit so

360.8 --> 366.24
when way back say

363.6 --> 369.52000000000004
up until pretty much 12 15 years ago i

366.24 --> 373.28000000000003
had a lot of dreams of my hometown

369.52 --> 375.52
where i grew up most of my years

373.28 --> 377.44
and it would have like

375.52 --> 380.15999999999997
alterations

377.44 --> 383.199
to the landscape there because yeah that

380.16 --> 384.319
village is all super flat but in my

383.199 --> 388.319
dream

384.319 --> 389.68
it was partially built on a giant hill

388.319 --> 390.96000000000004
when like

389.68 --> 393.52
the actual

390.96 --> 396.79999999999995
hill you can barely even call it a hill

393.52 --> 397.52
in that town is like really small

396.8 --> 398.24
like

397.52 --> 400.08
like

398.24 --> 401.759
you don't even pick up on it until you

400.08 --> 404.08
get close to it

401.759 --> 406.8
but yeah in my dream it basically

404.08 --> 409.68
reformed in a mountain

406.8 --> 411.919
like with like consistent buildings and

409.68 --> 413.919
everything that every time i came there

411.919 --> 416.08
would appear the same way

413.919 --> 418.88
right it's like a virtual landscape it's

416.08 --> 420.08
very fascinating to me

418.88 --> 423.28
but now

420.08 --> 425.35999999999996
in recent in the recent year i think

423.28 --> 426.96
i'm starting to have a manifestation of

425.36 --> 429.68
a new area

426.96 --> 432.71999999999997
which funnily

429.68 --> 432.72
there have been like

432.88 --> 438.24
pre-landscape formations where i would

435.84 --> 441.19899999999996
literally in my dreamscape travel out

438.24 --> 443.039
from my hometown to like

441.199 --> 445.759
territory outside there that had in

443.039 --> 448.71999999999997
reality have no connection whatsoever to

445.759 --> 452.319
what in the physical world is around

448.72 --> 455.36
that town but i would wander off

452.319 --> 458.40000000000003
on like roads

455.36 --> 461.199
and dirt roads through like semi forest

458.4 --> 462.79999999999995
it's not real forest it's like just

461.199 --> 465.28000000000003
trees and stuff

462.8 --> 468.479
but still in

465.28 --> 470.96
yeah built areas

468.479 --> 473.52
and in my dream now there's like this

470.96 --> 475.75899999999996
whole new forest that i seem to be

473.52 --> 477.19899999999996
hanging around in with with roads in

475.759 --> 479.759
there

477.199 --> 482.56
and i like meet people that it's it's

479.759 --> 484.40000000000003
weird it's a dream

482.56 --> 487.68
but that's the place i'm seem to be

484.4 --> 490.0
hanging around now and i really like it

487.68 --> 491.84000000000003
it's almost like there's gonna be like a

490.0 --> 494.4
village built there and i'm gonna do it

491.84 --> 497.919
but it's in my dreams yeah too bad

494.4 --> 497.919
would be cool in the real world

498.08 --> 500.71999999999997
but yeah

499.12 --> 502.639
there's no such place here in the

500.72 --> 505.96000000000004
netherlands because everywhere it's

502.639 --> 505.96000000000004
already built

507.599 --> 509.84
uh

513.76 --> 520.919
nautical mile varies

517.519 --> 520.919
okay cleary

523.519 --> 527.92
in what sense

526.08 --> 529.9200000000001
because i had a

527.92 --> 533.76
conception i think i i talked about it

529.92 --> 537.279
yesterday on my early bird show too

533.76 --> 538.959
about my suspicion of how the

537.279 --> 540.88
axis

538.959 --> 542.56
of the globe of the heavens the apparent

540.88 --> 544.64
axis of the apparent globe of the

542.56 --> 547.5189999999999
heavens

544.64 --> 550.0
polaris versus southern cross right that

547.519 --> 552.88
axis because the rotation around it is

550.0 --> 555.04
consistent but how the rotation of it

552.88 --> 557.04
alters

555.04 --> 558.56
further north and further south you go

557.04 --> 561.68
from the equator

558.56 --> 564.399
and if that were actually

561.68 --> 566.2399999999999
perfectly consistently true then yes

564.399 --> 567.68
nautical miles would have different

566.24 --> 570.399
distances

567.68 --> 572.56
in different regions that's i even tried

570.399 --> 574.959
to

572.56 --> 577.76
relay that

574.959 --> 578.7199999999999
that vision about it

577.76 --> 581.6
uh

578.72 --> 583.6800000000001
two days ago on fed

581.6 --> 585.76
but i've been getting a lot of like

583.68 --> 587.279
feedback from the guys that that's not

585.76 --> 590.56
the case

587.279 --> 594.64
but it's not

590.56 --> 594.64
i'm still not entirely convinced

595.839 --> 599.9200000000001
so yeah

597.279 --> 600.8
if my suspicions about that were correct

599.92 --> 605.8389999999999
then

600.8 --> 605.8389999999999
indeed it varies with latitude it should

606.24 --> 611.12
but only if the rotation of the apparent

609.68 --> 613.1999999999999
axis

611.12 --> 615.36
of the globe of the heavens

613.2 --> 617.279
would alter

615.36 --> 619.519
because if it is perfectly angular

617.279 --> 622.0
consistent everywhere

619.519 --> 624.0
its rotation

622.0 --> 626.8
then yeah nautical miles should be the

624.0 --> 626.8
same everywhere

630.959 --> 635.04
it varies from six times ah

636.8 --> 639.3599999999999
oh wow

644.079 --> 646.56
okay

645.2 --> 649.519
well

646.56 --> 651.1999999999999
that just put a literal number to it

649.519 --> 652.8
george sanford

651.2 --> 654.72
where did you

652.8 --> 657.7199999999999
get that information by the way these

654.72 --> 657.72
numbers

660.56 --> 665.04
that means somebody must have like

662.16 --> 665.04
calculated it

672.56 --> 675.8389999999999
hey jeff gassett

692.0 --> 698.2
dude if nobody's gonna tell me i'm just

694.16 --> 698.1999999999999
gonna google it myself

721.6 --> 725.839
okay

723.279 --> 730.68
in wiki it doesn't nautical mile doesn't

725.839 --> 730.6800000000001
reveal any variation in its distance

741.519 --> 747.44
oh wait no it does since the earth is

744.959 --> 750.079
not the perfect sphere what an old blade

747.44 --> 750.0790000000001
spheroid

750.48 --> 757.32
a minute of latitude is not constant

754.32 --> 757.32
huh

758.16 --> 760.959
right yeah

762.72 --> 765.9200000000001
let me

764.079 --> 769.2399999999999
present that

765.92 --> 769.24
for a second

782.24 --> 787.04
yeah

784.48 --> 789.04
but of course they give the reason

787.04 --> 791.1999999999999
because the earth is no blade spheroid

789.04 --> 793.5999999999999
well that's not really relevant

791.2 --> 793.6
at all

795.04 --> 801.12
just mean well

796.959 --> 803.04
the reason why is not super relevant

801.12 --> 807.12
right whatever you presuppose the earth

803.04 --> 807.12
to be underneath it it doesn't matter

809.839 --> 815.839
it's weird though to see this over here

812.32 --> 815.839
since at the beginning

817.279 --> 821.8389999999999
it says today the international is

819.12 --> 824.8
defined exactly

821.839 --> 827.6800000000001
1852

824.8 --> 829.279
right so it has an exact definition but

827.68 --> 830.3199999999999
then later

829.279 --> 832.72
it says

830.32 --> 834.88
since it's not a perfect sphere

832.72 --> 839.44
it's different that's really weird and

834.88 --> 840.8389999999999
contradicting like in the freaking wiki

839.44 --> 844.48
that's

840.839 --> 846.72
weird it's literally contradicting in

844.48 --> 848.9590000000001
the same wiki first it says it's exactly

846.72 --> 850.5600000000001
this then it says oh it's not

848.959 --> 852.2399999999999
perfect sphere so

850.56 --> 853.68
it's not

852.24 --> 857.0
exact

853.68 --> 857.0
it's different

858.56 --> 860.959
right

861.12 --> 863.839
that's weird

869.279 --> 872.72
wiki lies well

871.6 --> 875.839
lies

872.72 --> 880.6
it's literally contradicting itself

875.839 --> 880.6
in the same page that's odd

891.36 --> 896.0
it's not exactly a contradiction

894.32 --> 897.6800000000001
oh really

896.0 --> 901.36
so how is it

897.68 --> 901.3599999999999
not exactly a contradiction

901.44 --> 907.1990000000001
it's exactly this distance oh wait since

905.199 --> 912.8389999999999
it is not a globe

907.199 --> 912.8389999999999
it's that distance so it's not exact

913.92 --> 919.92
uh how is that not exactly a

916.56 --> 922.3199999999999
contradiction worship jesus

919.92 --> 924.639
and hey practical purposes yeah that's

922.32 --> 926.48
super cute but first it says it's

924.639 --> 930.24
exactly this distance and then it says

926.48 --> 930.24
it's not exactly that distance

936.959 --> 942.88
to avoid confusion

938.959 --> 944.3199999999999
is accepted as yes so it's accepted as

942.88 --> 948.16
that distance

944.32 --> 948.1600000000001
but in reality it isn't

949.519 --> 955.68
nature isn't x what the [ __ ] are you

952.72 --> 959.839
blabbering about

955.68 --> 959.8389999999999
what do you mean nature isn't exact

963.839 --> 969.519
has approximated all sorts of stuff for

966.56 --> 970.88
practical purposes no no it isn't nature

969.519 --> 975.839
is exact

970.88 --> 978.399
and that mankind creates oversimplified

975.839 --> 980.72
conventions about it

978.399 --> 982.48
is man's doing

980.72 --> 985.12
that has nothing to do with nature

982.48 --> 986.72
nature is exact

985.12 --> 989.36
this is a really weird thing to say

986.72 --> 992.6800000000001
worship jesus

989.36 --> 992.6800000000001
really weird

997.6 --> 1002.12
hello the other andrew by the way

1010.72 --> 1017.36
mankind has approximated time based yeah

1015.04 --> 1017.36
so

1022.72 --> 1028.24
and by the way it's not approximated

1025.199 --> 1031.199
it's derived it's derived from the

1028.24 --> 1031.199
movement of the sun

1033.52 --> 1038.4
it's not approximated because even the

1035.679 --> 1040.64
word approximation would suggest that

1038.4 --> 1041.679
there is an exact

1040.64 --> 1044.5590000000002
something

1041.679 --> 1049.2
there is no exact something concerning

1044.559 --> 1051.84
time because it is a derivative only

1049.2 --> 1053.44
it's not actually a thing that you can

1051.84 --> 1057.6399999999999
approximate

1053.44 --> 1057.64
it's a derived concept

1078.84 --> 1082.0
hmm

1080.559 --> 1083.12
right

1082.0 --> 1084.32
but

1083.12 --> 1086.32
still

1084.32 --> 1089.28
pretty cool that i turned out to be

1086.32 --> 1093.28
right when everybody in the fed panel

1089.28 --> 1096.799
was again no no no no no

1093.28 --> 1099.6
man do i hear a lot of no no no no no

1096.799 --> 1101.76
every time i pick up on something new

1099.6 --> 1104.1599999999999
and then it turns out to be completely

1101.76 --> 1104.16
true

1104.24 --> 1108.88
sometimes even in the same show i don't

1106.16 --> 1110.799
mind though you know i like i don't care

1108.88 --> 1112.64
at this point if they're gonna do no no

1110.799 --> 1114.32
no no no every time i pick up on

1112.64 --> 1116.0800000000002
something new that's their freaking

1114.32 --> 1117.4399999999998
issue they're the one calling it wrong

1116.08 --> 1119.6789999999999
not me

1117.44 --> 1119.679
right

1120.16 --> 1123.8400000000001
and it doesn't mean that i'm always

1121.679 --> 1123.8400000000001
right

1124.24 --> 1128.4
but

1125.44 --> 1132.0800000000002
yeah sometimes i pick up on something

1128.4 --> 1132.0800000000002
and it does turn out to be right

1135.84 --> 1143.52
and i'm definitely gonna rob uh yeah

1140.08 --> 1147.96
people on fvds faces in it then i was

1143.52 --> 1147.96
right i'm gonna do that today

1155.84 --> 1160.9599999999998
hey slow mo moon buggy good to see you

1158.559 --> 1165.12
dude i've been missing freaking jim bob

1160.96 --> 1169.2
where the hell's gymbop hanging around

1165.12 --> 1170.9599999999998
because i wanted to insert my uh

1169.2 --> 1173.1200000000001
angle oh

1170.96 --> 1176.16
sexton supremacy

1173.12 --> 1180.8799999999999
in his chat but there like has popped up

1176.16 --> 1180.88
for three days now really annoying

1181.12 --> 1186.2399999999998
dammit jim bob you can't

1183.28 --> 1189.72
withhold yourself from us

1186.24 --> 1189.72
how dare you

1192.88 --> 1197.3600000000001
the no no no chant usually means i'm

1195.039 --> 1199.919
over the target but it's just not the

1197.36 --> 1202.6399999999999
convenient moment for it yeah that makes

1199.919 --> 1204.0800000000002
sense slow-mo moon buggy

1202.64 --> 1206.72
but

1204.08 --> 1209.039
i'd prefer if they just say

1206.72 --> 1213.039
maybe but

1209.039 --> 1213.039
we're trying to focus on something else

1213.76 --> 1218.0
but fine

1216.32 --> 1220.08
they want to say no no no and then

1218.0 --> 1222.88
afterward it turns out i was right yeah

1220.08 --> 1222.8799999999999
that's on them

1228.799 --> 1232.36
what the hell

1254.88 --> 1259.1200000000001
yeah by the way clearly i don't exactly

1257.12 --> 1261.039
see how worship jesus was double

1259.12 --> 1263.36
speaking

1261.039 --> 1265.44
myself

1263.36 --> 1268.24
i mean he basically is laying down that

1265.44 --> 1270.799
there is a diff yeah different nature

1268.24 --> 1272.799
time derivative

1270.799 --> 1278.32
original nautical mile and the

1272.799 --> 1278.32
convention of it to us set distance

1278.559 --> 1283.039
i don't see where his double spoke about

1280.96 --> 1283.039
it

1289.28 --> 1293.76
although if he really is a glober it's

1292.0 --> 1298.039
not going to take long before he will

1293.76 --> 1298.039
because they always do in the end

1318.88 --> 1322.64
it is yeah that but that's what i'm

1320.88 --> 1325.2800000000002
saying clearly

1322.64 --> 1327.679
there's an original

1325.28 --> 1332.3999999999999
celestial derivative

1327.679 --> 1334.799
nautical mile which varies per region

1332.4 --> 1338.159
and then there is the man

1334.799 --> 1340.24
made convention

1338.159 --> 1342.159
after

1340.24 --> 1344.08
that

1342.159 --> 1346.72
in a set distance

1344.08 --> 1350.4399999999998
that's what he's saying

1346.72 --> 1350.44
that's what i'm saying

1366.64 --> 1369.64
hmm

1379.52 --> 1383.679
all right also interesting to realize

1381.52 --> 1386.799
that

1383.679 --> 1388.72
the nautical mile variation

1386.799 --> 1390.32
has nothing to do with the map

1388.72 --> 1391.919
projection

1390.32 --> 1393.76
it is purely

1391.919 --> 1395.76
because of the

1393.76 --> 1397.36
celestial

1395.76 --> 1398.8799999999999
sphere

1397.36 --> 1402.3999999999999
relation

1398.88 --> 1405.679
to actual distances so it isn't because

1402.4 --> 1407.679
of the layout of the map

1405.679 --> 1410.24
that's an interesting thing to realize

1407.679 --> 1411.679
it's purely a celestial derivative it

1410.24 --> 1414.679
has nothing to do with any map

1411.679 --> 1414.679
projections

1416.48 --> 1422.72
so you can't say oh it's because of the

1418.4 --> 1425.1200000000001
map like no the map has nothing to do

1422.72 --> 1429.08
with the celestial derivative for the

1425.12 --> 1429.08
actual terrain distances

1438.64 --> 1442.7990000000002
what now the command is not a standard

1440.559 --> 1444.799
it is impossible to measure distance

1442.799 --> 1446.24
that's not true

1444.799 --> 1448.72
what the hell are you talking about

1446.24 --> 1448.72
cleary

1450.72 --> 1455.52
i mean

1452.159 --> 1458.159
yeah let's say 500 years ago that would

1455.52 --> 1459.6
have been very difficult right to

1458.159 --> 1462.48
measure

1459.6 --> 1464.0
actual distances on the ocean nowadays

1462.48 --> 1466.32
not so much

1464.0 --> 1468.96
i mean you can literally

1466.32 --> 1471.6
technologically scan the bottom

1468.96 --> 1475.2
that bottom is not going to shift

1471.6 --> 1480.039
so you can actually measure real

1475.2 --> 1480.039
literal distances even on the ocean

1506.559 --> 1510.8799999999999
how do you measure distance traveled in

1509.12 --> 1513.12
a head wing

1510.88 --> 1515.279
or in an ocean current the way i just

1513.12 --> 1518.32
described clearly i don't know if you're

1515.279 --> 1520.32
lagging behind a few minutes

1518.32 --> 1522.72
i just described it

1520.32 --> 1525.039
500 years ago

1522.72 --> 1527.279
the oceanic floor

1525.039 --> 1528.72
was completely out of reach for

1527.279 --> 1531.52
explorers

1528.72 --> 1532.559
right they couldn't see it and they had

1531.52 --> 1535.2
no

1532.559 --> 1536.559
like radio based scanning

1535.2 --> 1538.88
technology

1536.559 --> 1541.52
safe to say

1538.88 --> 1543.8400000000001
now we do so it doesn't matter if you're

1541.52 --> 1546.1589999999999
flying

1543.84 --> 1548.1589999999999
or if you're on the ocean without any

1546.159 --> 1550.159
land in sight

1548.159 --> 1551.679
you can

1550.159 --> 1554.72
scan the bottom

1551.679 --> 1554.72
with technology

1555.6 --> 1559.84
and then since the bottom doesn't just

1557.679 --> 1562.24
constantly shift around

1559.84 --> 1563.36
you can still

1562.24 --> 1565.919
yeah

1563.36 --> 1567.6
figure out exactly where you are on the

1565.919 --> 1570.72
terrain

1567.6 --> 1574.559
based on the oceanic floor something

1570.72 --> 1574.559
they couldn't do 500 years ago

1579.76 --> 1585.279
to understand the difference between

1581.919 --> 1589.6000000000001
measurement and hello have you been

1585.279 --> 1589.6
hearing what i'm saying clary

1594.0 --> 1599.6
where did i draw in the word calculation

1596.72 --> 1601.919
either even i didn't that's what you

1599.6 --> 1601.9189999999999
doing

1602.0 --> 1608.679
i just said actual terrain measurement

1605.44 --> 1608.679
not calculation

1647.12 --> 1651.76
also just kind of a weird remark there

1649.2 --> 1653.2
clearly you really think

1651.76 --> 1657.039
i don't understand the difference

1653.2 --> 1659.2
between measurement and calculation

1657.039 --> 1662.399
you really think that i

1659.2 --> 1665.3990000000001
don't know the difference between that

1662.399 --> 1665.399
really

1668.32 --> 1672.24
you're either in a state of mind fog if

1670.799 --> 1674.24
you think that

1672.24 --> 1675.52
or you're just

1674.24 --> 1677.1200000000001
like

1675.52 --> 1679.52
you don't know me

1677.12 --> 1679.52
at all

1679.84 --> 1684.24
it's a weird thing to say to somebody

1681.679 --> 1684.24
like me

1685.12 --> 1690.6399999999999
i think if anybody

1687.76 --> 1694.48
in flat earth knows the difference is me

1690.64 --> 1697.72
i literally play around with it i play

1694.48 --> 1697.72
with it

1699.12 --> 1702.559
like in my ballwin

1701.36 --> 1707.559
enactments

1702.559 --> 1707.559
so yeah i damn well know the difference

1725.2 --> 1728.64
nautical miles are calculated not

1727.039 --> 1730.96
measured

1728.64 --> 1734.0800000000002
yeah they're derived from celestial

1730.96 --> 1734.08
angles i know that

1736.32 --> 1741.6789999999999
but the actual terrain

1738.48 --> 1742.96
can be sized up with literal

1741.679 --> 1745.44
measurements

1742.96 --> 1748.64
based on the ocean bottom right

1745.44 --> 1751.6000000000001
and that's how you can then put

1748.64 --> 1754.7990000000002
the nautical mile

1751.6 --> 1757.1999999999998
derivative from the celestials and cross

1754.799 --> 1760.2
reference it with the actual terrain

1757.2 --> 1760.2
measurements

1790.72 --> 1793.72
okay

1824.24 --> 1829.279
it's just calculate well i'm sure that

1826.64 --> 1831.279
they just calculated right because

1829.279 --> 1833.52
they're not concerned with with the

1831.279 --> 1837.84
exact distance they just

1833.52 --> 1840.799
are navigating they want to arrive

1837.84 --> 1842.9599999999998
as exact as possible so they're just

1840.799 --> 1844.96
going to calculate it

1842.96 --> 1847.039
and that would be good enough although i

1844.96 --> 1850.48
bet look if they're going to like travel

1847.039 --> 1852.08
super long distances over the ocean and

1850.48 --> 1856.08
they're going to use nautical mild

1852.08 --> 1858.1589999999999
calculation especially if they move

1856.08 --> 1861.36
north to south south to north

1858.159 --> 1863.6000000000001
then there will be deviations this is

1861.36 --> 1865.12
guaranteed because the actual nautical

1863.6 --> 1869.039
mile

1865.12 --> 1870.799
has different distances north and south

1869.039 --> 1873.039
right they'll still get around but it's

1870.799 --> 1876.84
going to be like oh we're like two miles

1873.039 --> 1880.1589999999999
or three miles off or something

1876.84 --> 1881.12
right but since your hallway is going to

1880.159 --> 1883.1200000000001
end up

1881.12 --> 1885.4399999999998
landing on land

1883.12 --> 1887.279
you have the visual recognition of the

1885.44 --> 1890.0800000000002
land so

1887.279 --> 1891.919
right it's just navigation it's just

1890.08 --> 1894.24
about trying to arrive at the

1891.919 --> 1895.679
designation that's all

1894.24 --> 1897.519
they're not like

1895.679 --> 1899.519
creating a new map

1897.519 --> 1901.76
of exactness

1899.519 --> 1901.76
so

1909.36 --> 1912.36
so

1938.799 --> 1944.399
right but also yeah let it be

1941.76 --> 1948.08
understood for all of you in chat before

1944.399 --> 1950.399
you just end up bickering endlessly

1948.08 --> 1952.48
about this

1950.399 --> 1954.8799999999999
instead of well moving on with the

1952.48 --> 1958.32
conversation yeah

1954.88 --> 1960.5590000000002
nautical miles are celestial derivatives

1958.32 --> 1963.12
actual

1960.559 --> 1965.519
official nautical miles are a set

1963.12 --> 1968.32
distance all the the measure yeah

1965.519 --> 1971.679
numerical distances

1968.32 --> 1973.9189999999999
conventions like this is what we decide

1971.679 --> 1977.44
that distance to be it has nothing to do

1973.919 --> 1979.8400000000001
with the actual nautical miles

1977.44 --> 1982.159
that are the original derivative it's

1979.84 --> 1983.1999999999998
just based

1982.159 --> 1987.519
on it

1983.2 --> 1989.519
based on it not literally it you see

1987.519 --> 1992.559
so you can endlessly

1989.519 --> 1994.64
bicker about which one is the real one

1992.559 --> 1995.44
well they're just two different things

1994.64 --> 1998.3990000000001
one

1995.44 --> 2000.799
is a celestial derived

1998.399 --> 2004.08
calculated distance

2000.799 --> 2007.36
the other is a convention based

2004.08 --> 2007.36
numerical distance

2008.559 --> 2011.96
that's it

2022.08 --> 2026.96
right and inches and

2025.44 --> 2028.96
feet

2026.96 --> 2031.44
are probably the same i don't know

2028.96 --> 2033.44
exactly like if they maybe they're all

2031.44 --> 2034.72
like derived from the nautical mile in

2033.44 --> 2036.3990000000001
some way

2034.72 --> 2039.44
but

2036.399 --> 2040.32
they have all become

2039.44 --> 2043.2
well

2040.32 --> 2046.6399999999999
convinced convention based

2043.2 --> 2048.879
set numerical distances

2046.64 --> 2052.159
that's the convention made by man has

2048.879 --> 2054.0789999999997
nothing to do really with the origin

2052.159 --> 2059.639
with the actual

2054.079 --> 2059.639
celestial derived calculated distance

2066.24 --> 2069.24
uh

2092.24 --> 2097.52
okay can you stop bicker about this

2094.32 --> 2102.119
youtube you're literally

2097.52 --> 2102.119
scaring the rest of my chat away

2108.56 --> 2111.56
so

2125.04 --> 2129.92
it's how they hide larger distances

2127.359 --> 2131.119
across the oceans of

2129.92 --> 2133.599
sure

2131.119 --> 2136.599
but also in the north

2133.599 --> 2136.599
cleary

2144.8 --> 2148.7200000000003
right well

2146.48 --> 2148.72
look

2149.2 --> 2154.0789999999997
to conceal the difference in distance of

2152.16 --> 2156.839
the nautical mile

2154.079 --> 2159.04
is going to be like an

2156.839 --> 2160.72
assistant like a

2159.04 --> 2164.0
temporary

2160.72 --> 2164.9599999999996
in the moment assistant

2164.0 --> 2166.72
thing

2164.96 --> 2167.839
don't know how to describe it exactly

2166.72 --> 2170.64
what it is

2167.839 --> 2173.44
it's like a micro aberration

2170.64 --> 2175.2799999999997
that will assist ballers to kind of

2173.44 --> 2177.52
explain away why there's too much

2175.28 --> 2179.76
territory in the north and south for the

2177.52 --> 2181.92
globe to fit right

2179.76 --> 2183.2000000000003
which also even becomes

2181.92 --> 2185.52
revealed

2183.2 --> 2187.68
when you do the circle of equal altitude

2185.52 --> 2190.32
on the

2187.68 --> 2192.0
the rectangular map i'm sorry guys i

2190.32 --> 2194.4
can't

2192.0 --> 2198.079
it's been like six years and i just

2194.4 --> 2201.359
can't get the freaking names of the maps

2198.079 --> 2203.6800000000003
in my head i can't do it

2201.359 --> 2206.7999999999997
it just doesn't work i just keep on

2203.68 --> 2208.8799999999997
mixing it up it's freaking insane

2206.8 --> 2211.76
i just keep mixing up so i'm just going

2208.88 --> 2213.28
to call it descriptively the rectangular

2211.76 --> 2214.8
map the map

2213.28 --> 2215.76
that i even

2214.8 --> 2218.6400000000003
use

2215.76 --> 2221.0400000000004
in the thumbnail for the early bird show

2218.64 --> 2221.04
that

2221.2 --> 2224.24
rectangular map

2224.96 --> 2229.599
all right when you use circle of equal

2226.56 --> 2233.839
altitude calculations and you then

2229.599 --> 2234.8
fold the thing on the globe

2233.839 --> 2236.4
which

2234.8 --> 2239.2000000000003
yeah it is supposed to be a glow

2236.4 --> 2242.32
projection then suddenly

2239.2 --> 2245.2
it malforms there we come the circles

2242.32 --> 2250.2400000000002
become tear drop shapes

2245.2 --> 2251.9199999999996
mercator fine i keep mixing them up i i

2250.24 --> 2255.2
seriously when i hear mkater i'm

2251.92 --> 2257.28
thinking of the disc map stupid why why

2255.2 --> 2259.68
can't i just get the freaking names of

2257.28 --> 2262.079
the maps right

2259.68 --> 2262.0789999999997
god

2262.56 --> 2270.68
i'm just gonna describe it

2265.52 --> 2270.68
disc map rectangular map

2275.52 --> 2277.839
right

2282.64 --> 2286.56
what was the point of making yeah right

2284.24 --> 2287.839
so there's deviations

2286.56 --> 2290.16
in the north and the south on the

2287.839 --> 2293.2799999999997
rectangular map which is supposed to be

2290.16 --> 2295.2799999999997
a glow projection

2293.28 --> 2296.7200000000003
and

2295.28 --> 2298.6400000000003
yeah

2296.72 --> 2300.7999999999997
nautical miles having become a

2298.64 --> 2304.96
convention even though they're celestial

2300.8 --> 2306.079
derivatives and apparently the celestial

2304.96 --> 2308.64
axis

2306.079 --> 2312.079
rotation is not entirely consistent when

2308.64 --> 2313.0789999999997
you go north and south from the equator

2312.079 --> 2316.48
and so

2313.079 --> 2319.44
bypassing that and just repealing to the

2316.48 --> 2322.48
convention of the set distance

2319.44 --> 2324.839
kind of helps overlook that there's too

2322.48 --> 2328.64
much territory in the north and the

2324.839 --> 2331.44
south compared to the map

2328.64 --> 2332.24
that includes the disk map by the way

2331.44 --> 2335.52
right

2332.24 --> 2338.3199999999997
that assists like an aberrant

2335.52 --> 2341.04
an aberrant deviation

2338.32 --> 2344.52
that you can then just

2341.04 --> 2344.52
quickly overlook

2364.0 --> 2368.0
right but also

2366.079 --> 2369.44
like the whole situation with the

2368.0 --> 2371.599
mercator map i'm just going to get it

2369.44 --> 2372.88
straight for now at least

2371.599 --> 2376.4
is

2372.88 --> 2377.6800000000003
i have a strong strong suspicion by now

2376.4 --> 2380.8
that it is

2377.68 --> 2383.44
the actual terrain

2380.8 --> 2385.44
that that the rectangular map may

2383.44 --> 2388.32
literally be

2385.44 --> 2390.7200000000003
the real the real map although yeah even

2388.32 --> 2392.48
using the word map

2390.72 --> 2394.3199999999997
almost undoes that

2392.48 --> 2398.0
but i think it might be the actual

2394.32 --> 2401.28
euclidean representation of our realm

2398.0 --> 2401.28
despite everything

2403.04 --> 2407.079
because if

2405.2 --> 2408.68
yeah

2407.079 --> 2412.079
exploratory

2408.68 --> 2415.7599999999998
operations are utilized

2412.079 --> 2417.599
calculations operations using that map

2415.76 --> 2420.8
literally

2417.599 --> 2421.76
because it's the most the euclidean

2420.8 --> 2424.1600000000003
well

2421.76 --> 2429.0400000000004
one could conclude that that means it's

2424.16 --> 2431.359
the actual representation of the terrain

2429.04 --> 2433.04
it's been my suspicion for a long time

2431.359 --> 2436.04
and now i'm getting even more hints of

2433.04 --> 2436.04
this

2444.0 --> 2449.359
the ae map is perfect except it's

2447.119 --> 2452.359
absolutely not it's completely out of

2449.359 --> 2452.359
whack

2453.04 --> 2458.4
nothing is euclidean

2455.359 --> 2458.4
in the ae map

2458.56 --> 2463.2799999999997
too little room at the north

2460.8 --> 2464.8
too stretched out

2463.28 --> 2468.7200000000003
and squashed

2464.8 --> 2468.7200000000003
in the south it's not literal

2478.96 --> 2482.48
gold petersen pretty f

2485.28 --> 2488.28
what

2496.48 --> 2501.599
yeah now the ae map is not

2499.2 --> 2504.9199999999996
an accurate representation

2501.599 --> 2504.92
of the terrain

2511.28 --> 2516.8
oh by the way god i almost forgot

2514.8 --> 2521.28
oh

2516.8 --> 2524.8
yesterday on the baby truth or shoe

2521.28 --> 2527.92
awake souls they actually dragged awake

2524.8 --> 2527.92
souls in their show

2528.0 --> 2531.52
and that was

2529.52 --> 2536.839
nuts

2531.52 --> 2536.839
that guy is freaking psychotic dude

2537.2 --> 2542.8799999999997
and i don't i'm not even at homing

2540.16 --> 2546.24
like that guy is

2542.88 --> 2546.2400000000002
he's flat earthing

2546.4 --> 2550.56
like

2547.2 --> 2553.52
the priests of old

2550.56 --> 2553.52
would make up

2553.92 --> 2560.4
their story and just

2556.48 --> 2560.4
that's what he's doing it's nuts

2561.04 --> 2565.2799999999997
although he had some interesting moments

2563.04 --> 2567.2799999999997
because i think i wonder if he even

2565.28 --> 2568.8
realizes what he does you know when you

2567.28 --> 2571.76
go that nutty

2568.8 --> 2573.92
but he was arguing things like the sun

2571.76 --> 2574.96
is literally under the clouds and i'm

2573.92 --> 2578.56
like

2574.96 --> 2579.599
yeah yeah it is it's holographic

2578.56 --> 2581.68
oh

2579.599 --> 2584.7200000000003
then the guys in german side and dave

2581.68 --> 2587.52
were outraged but if you go higher up

2584.72 --> 2590.48
it's not actually there yeah because

2587.52 --> 2593.119
it's holographic it's gonna move with

2590.48 --> 2596.48
you you move up sun's gonna move above

2593.119 --> 2597.92
the clouds you are on the ground sun

2596.48 --> 2600.48
literally

2597.92 --> 2602.56
under the clouds i have seen it i have

2600.48 --> 2605.119
seen

2602.56 --> 2607.52
impossible sights like that i wish i

2605.119 --> 2608.56
would have filmed it it was like a week

2607.52 --> 2610.96
ago

2608.56 --> 2614.319
it was this giant cloud bank

2610.96 --> 2615.52
and another cloud bank in the distance

2614.319 --> 2618.88
you could

2615.52 --> 2620.88
not see the sun it was not

2618.88 --> 2623.04
anywhere in the open sky there were

2620.88 --> 2625.76
still blue spots

2623.04 --> 2628.0
and then somehow

2625.76 --> 2630.88
it shone

2628.0 --> 2632.88
from underneath the cloud in the back

2630.88 --> 2637.52
and highlighted

2632.88 --> 2639.28
line bottom of the big cloud in front

2637.52 --> 2643.2
so i would literally see like this

2639.28 --> 2645.2000000000003
golden line of the cloud at the bottom

2643.2 --> 2647.68
even though i could not see the sun in

2645.2 --> 2648.56
the distance and there was a cloud there

2647.68 --> 2650.0
too

2648.56 --> 2652.319
that's like

2650.0 --> 2655.04
that's impossible

2652.319 --> 2658.0
if the sun was actually a literal light

2655.04 --> 2660.4
at any location for any reason

2658.0 --> 2662.64
so it was kind of funny that he said no

2660.4 --> 2665.04
no the sun is under the clouds yeah it

2662.64 --> 2668.72
is he was right he just probably doesn't

2665.04 --> 2671.2
understand why and neither did the guys

2668.72 --> 2673.9199999999996
because yeah it's a it's a hologram it

2671.2 --> 2677.52
doesn't have a literal location he was

2673.92 --> 2679.359
talking about oh it's the sphere of view

2677.52 --> 2682.0
like

2679.359 --> 2683.92
awake souls is basically trying to model

2682.0 --> 2686.16
out a whole bunch of things that i've

2683.92 --> 2688.56
been talking about except he's using a

2686.16 --> 2690.72
completely different lingo for it

2688.56 --> 2692.96
and i wonder if he truly understands

2690.72 --> 2694.64
what the [ __ ] he's even saying

2692.96 --> 2697.28
or if he's just

2694.64 --> 2698.56
purely on intuition just trying to ride

2697.28 --> 2700.8
his way through

2698.56 --> 2703.359
because half of the time just looked

2700.8 --> 2705.6800000000003
like he had absolutely no clue what the

2703.359 --> 2707.2799999999997
hell he was talking about

2705.68 --> 2709.2
but it was very interesting the

2707.28 --> 2712.2400000000002
observations about yeah

2709.2 --> 2713.5989999999997
sun literally under the cloud yeah

2712.24 --> 2716.319
literally

2713.599 --> 2718.56
literally under the clouds

2716.319 --> 2720.4
that's right

2718.56 --> 2722.7999999999997
because it doesn't have an actual

2720.4 --> 2725.359
position only a virtual position in

2722.8 --> 2727.28
relation to the observer that's where it

2725.359 --> 2728.7999999999997
is that's where the light play will come

2727.28 --> 2731.2000000000003
from

2728.8 --> 2734.6400000000003
and at times that will mean that the sun

2731.2 --> 2738.16
will literally shine its light on the

2734.64 --> 2740.0789999999997
bottom of the clouds in relation to the

2738.16 --> 2740.96
observer on the ground that's gonna

2740.079 --> 2743.44
happen

2740.96 --> 2746.2400000000002
it happens

2743.44 --> 2749.599
and yeah it's gonna be very very

2746.24 --> 2751.4399999999996
confusing to those that just insist no

2749.599 --> 2753.44
it has to be it is that this doesn't

2751.44 --> 2756.48
make no sense

2753.44 --> 2758.96
no it's a freaking hologram deal with it

2756.48 --> 2761.04
it's a hologram it's a hologram it's a

2758.96 --> 2764.319
hologram it doesn't have an actual

2761.04 --> 2767.119
position it only has a virtual position

2764.319 --> 2770.64
and that position can be anywhere

2767.119 --> 2772.6400000000003
on the edge of your view including under

2770.64 --> 2775.839
the clouds

2772.64 --> 2775.839
deal with it

2783.52 --> 2786.96
right

2785.119 --> 2790.079
but it was kind of interesting to see

2786.96 --> 2791.92
them go back and forth and i was like

2790.079 --> 2795.04
okay

2791.92 --> 2797.2000000000003
why haven't they invited me about this

2795.04 --> 2800.839
so i'm too scary

2797.2 --> 2804.64
i'm too offensive perhaps

2800.839 --> 2807.119
unpredictable oh i don't know why

2804.64 --> 2809.68
but i've been discussing this [ __ ] for

2807.119 --> 2812.2400000000002
years now

2809.68 --> 2815.1189999999997
and i don't act like a complete savage

2812.24 --> 2819.1189999999997
towards everybody

2815.119 --> 2821.76
like he does blatantly like come on

2819.119 --> 2824.8
awake souls like one of the worst gammas

2821.76 --> 2827.0400000000004
out there among flat earth and

2824.8 --> 2829.76
the only thing that kind of offsets it

2827.04 --> 2830.56
is that he does kind of make work

2829.76 --> 2833.2000000000003
he

2830.56 --> 2836.7999999999997
did build that model it doesn't make any

2833.2 --> 2839.1189999999997
freaking sense it's a giant reification

2836.8 --> 2843.319
but at least he has like pretty cool

2839.119 --> 2843.319
visuals he's working on that

2844.559 --> 2849.88
oh okay rest that

2846.48 --> 2849.88
check it out

2861.28 --> 2863.76
okay

2876.4 --> 2881.44
do i even know what a hologram is yeah

2878.88 --> 2884.4
an image of light an image of light

2881.44 --> 2885.2000000000003
something that is light only

2884.4 --> 2888.4
that

2885.2 --> 2891.2799999999997
by nature of its arrangement

2888.4 --> 2893.92
may give the appearance of being an

2891.28 --> 2897.28
actual light-based object in a literal

2893.92 --> 2899.44
location in space but it isn't it's

2897.28 --> 2901.599
light play

2899.44 --> 2903.44
that's what a hologram is i know exactly

2901.599 --> 2906.0
what a hologram is and i'm not talking

2903.44 --> 2908.4
about a technological hologram i'm

2906.0 --> 2909.28
talking about the literal root of the

2908.4 --> 2912.7200000000003
word

2909.28 --> 2914.4
from which the technology has taken its

2912.72 --> 2916.48
name

2914.4 --> 2917.44
holo gram

2916.48 --> 2919.599
light

2917.44 --> 2921.04
image

2919.599 --> 2922.96
that's what it is

2921.04 --> 2926.48
not the technology

2922.96 --> 2926.48
an image of light

2927.44 --> 2932.119
i know exactly what i'm talking about

2956.319 --> 2962.319
it doesn't oh just hand wave dismissal

2959.44 --> 2964.559
then oh that's a great argument tartan

2962.319 --> 2966.72
telescope

2964.559 --> 2967.92
you're a regular genius

2966.72 --> 2969.04
i mean

2967.92 --> 2972.16
nothing

2969.04 --> 2974.64
can ever trump a handwave dismissal

2972.16 --> 2977.64
that's like the ultimate argument

2974.64 --> 2977.64
right

3014.24 --> 3022.64
i dismiss the real thing

3018.96 --> 3025.839
oh you mean your stupid little math

3022.64 --> 3028.16
projection of astronomical distances

3025.839 --> 3031.44
even though the shadows cast by all

3028.16 --> 3033.359
those astronomically distant lights

3031.44 --> 3034.64
are not parallel

3033.359 --> 3037.04
yeah

3034.64 --> 3038.839
yeah i'm just dismissing your

3037.04 --> 3041.7599999999998
abject

3038.839 --> 3044.64
delusion that is like practically proven

3041.76 --> 3046.0
to be completely incorrect yeah i

3044.64 --> 3047.92
dismiss that

3046.0 --> 3049.68
based on actual evidence that's not what

3047.92 --> 3052.2400000000002
you're doing though you're just saying

3049.68 --> 3053.839
oh that's just wrong

3052.24 --> 3056.9599999999996
you're not elaborating you're not

3053.839 --> 3060.319
pointing out the details of why it is

3056.96 --> 3062.96
wrong what observations are there what

3060.319 --> 3064.48
things have been figured out that prove

3062.96 --> 3068.2400000000002
them wrong

3064.48 --> 3071.44
no that's not what you're doing are you

3068.24 --> 3074.5589999999997
tartan telescopes

3071.44 --> 3076.96
how does heat work oh

3074.559 --> 3078.8
yes quickly quickly scatter go on to the

3076.96 --> 3080.7200000000003
next subject

3078.8 --> 3082.48
right let's let's quickly move from

3080.72 --> 3085.4399999999996
observations to

3082.48 --> 3087.92
physics heat transfer yes yes that's

3085.44 --> 3090.92
gonna prove your model right you [ __ ]

3087.92 --> 3090.92
[ __ ]

3122.64 --> 3127.7599999999998
eat from the sun oh

3124.67 --> 3130.2400000000002
[Music]

3127.76 --> 3131.92
no there is no radiation

3130.24 --> 3136.24
there's no heat

3131.92 --> 3137.44
radiation as in a radiator as in

3136.24 --> 3140.3999999999996
heat lamp

3137.44 --> 3143.76
that's not the sun because this heat

3140.4 --> 3146.559
this type of heat when you get closer

3143.76 --> 3147.6800000000003
it gets warmer it gets warmer warmer

3146.559 --> 3149.8390000000004
yeah that's

3147.68 --> 3151.359
proximity heat that's heat radiation

3149.839 --> 3153.839
yeah

3151.359 --> 3153.839
light

3153.92 --> 3158.8
going places

3155.599 --> 3160.1600000000003
arriving and then being transformed into

3158.8 --> 3162.8
heat

3160.16 --> 3165.44
that's not proximity heat

3162.8 --> 3167.8390000000004
it's not proximity heat

3165.44 --> 3172.839
it's light heat

3167.839 --> 3172.839
that becomes heat when it's absorbed

3180.88 --> 3186.6400000000003
insults because if you know since no i

3183.599 --> 3189.76
addressed everything you say every

3186.64 --> 3191.5989999999997
little detail tartan telescopes

3189.76 --> 3193.8390000000004
no matter what you throw out and how

3191.599 --> 3195.92
quickly you throw out even if you start

3193.839 --> 3198.96
to scatter gummy with like 20 different

3195.92 --> 3202.96
questions i will answer those questions

3198.96 --> 3206.4
almost instantly and perfectly every

3202.96 --> 3208.64
[ __ ] step of the way every answer i

3206.4 --> 3211.44
will have every answer and they will all

3208.64 --> 3212.72
be correct because i

3211.44 --> 3214.64
know

3212.72 --> 3216.72
what the [ __ ] is real

3214.64 --> 3219.839
you're a globetard

3216.72 --> 3222.9599999999996
you are just trying to scurry to keep

3219.839 --> 3225.92
your globe religious model in your mind

3222.96 --> 3230.2400000000002
cohesive i actually know how it was

3225.92 --> 3232.48
designed i know the delusion that you

3230.24 --> 3233.5989999999997
believed to be real and how it was

3232.48 --> 3234.96
designed

3233.599 --> 3237.119
i'm actually

3234.96 --> 3240.0
working on that [ __ ]

3237.119 --> 3242.079
yeah because i know the answers right

3240.0 --> 3244.64
unless you're gonna like directly ask me

3242.079 --> 3246.079
some kind of a math question which i

3244.64 --> 3247.68
don't like

3246.079 --> 3250.2400000000002
i'm not good at that

3247.68 --> 3252.16
i dislike it and when i dislike things

3250.24 --> 3255.5989999999997
i'm not good at it but when it comes to

3252.16 --> 3258.3999999999996
an actual technical

3255.599 --> 3259.52
physics related question

3258.4 --> 3262.2400000000002
right

3259.52 --> 3265.2
or perception based question

3262.24 --> 3267.839
yeah i can answer every

3265.2 --> 3269.52
little scatter gun shitty question you

3267.839 --> 3271.92
launch at me

3269.52 --> 3273.839
no matter how fast no matter how many

3271.92 --> 3276.7200000000003
because i've heard it all

3273.839 --> 3280.319
every single one

3276.72 --> 3281.2
you could compare me to neo

3280.319 --> 3283.119
yeah

3281.2 --> 3284.96
when he's at the merovingian and they

3283.119 --> 3288.6400000000003
just all come forward and they start

3284.96 --> 3291.839
spraying him i'm stopping every single

3288.64 --> 3293.839
scattergun bullet every single one

3291.839 --> 3297.44
because i know them all

3293.839 --> 3299.92
all of it there's nothing you can say

3297.44 --> 3302.16
that can make me flustered except for

3299.92 --> 3305.28
stupid math questions which wouldn't

3302.16 --> 3307.1189999999997
relate to anything anyway right

3305.28 --> 3309.2000000000003
so

3307.119 --> 3311.2000000000003
more insults no no no

3309.2 --> 3313.7599999999998
that's a challenge that's called a

3311.2 --> 3316.16
challenge you can scatter gun me all you

3313.76 --> 3318.559
like move on to the next question and

3316.16 --> 3321.04
then i'll answer that question and prove

3318.559 --> 3324.6400000000003
you're wrong again based on real

3321.04 --> 3326.5589999999997
physical world examples

3324.64 --> 3328.319
and technical workings that have been

3326.559 --> 3330.7200000000003
proven to be right

3328.319 --> 3330.72
[ __ ]

3331.28 --> 3337.92
yeah but you keep complaining about my

3334.72 --> 3339.5989999999997
insults keep complaining i'm so mean i'm

3337.92 --> 3343.839
so mean to you

3339.599 --> 3343.839
yeah that's because you're moving away

3344.079 --> 3349.04
from the question after i've just proven

3346.799 --> 3350.24
you wrong

3349.04 --> 3352.319
and then you're going to do the same

3350.24 --> 3353.9199999999996
thing again because that's what you do

3352.319 --> 3354.96
that's what you do when you're a bald

3353.92 --> 3358.4
heart

3354.96 --> 3360.079
so force a habit it's the only way to go

3358.4 --> 3364.1600000000003
i know

3360.079 --> 3365.92
i do it myself i can actually reenact

3364.16 --> 3367.839
your mindset

3365.92 --> 3369.599
do you understand that

3367.839 --> 3371.7599999999998
it's very frustrating isn't it because

3369.599 --> 3372.96
you think it's real

3371.76 --> 3375.5200000000004
i don't

3372.96 --> 3378.96
but i know how it works i know how the

3375.52 --> 3381.28
mind works i know how your mind works

3378.96 --> 3385.44
and i know you got nothing left but just

3381.28 --> 3386.6400000000003
being oh he's so mean he's so mean

3385.44 --> 3390.119
oh

3386.64 --> 3390.1189999999997
so mean

3406.85 --> 3410.0299999999997
[Applause]

3415.04 --> 3421.44
radiation is particles of light well

3418.319 --> 3424.64
when we create it here on earth

3421.44 --> 3424.64
right if you charge

3424.96 --> 3429.68
like a a piece of metal

3428.079 --> 3430.559
it's going to radiate

3429.68 --> 3432.799
light

3430.559 --> 3434.88
and heat depending on

3432.799 --> 3437.359
yeah the amount of electricity the type

3434.88 --> 3440.1600000000003
material etc etc

3437.359 --> 3443.2
yeah it can generate heat locally

3440.16 --> 3444.319
but that's not the sun

3443.2 --> 3448.16
sun

3444.319 --> 3449.52
is just an apparition it's a hologram

3448.16 --> 3451.7599999999998
that you see

3449.52 --> 3454.4
at the focal point

3451.76 --> 3455.2000000000003
for you as an observer

3454.4 --> 3457.839
in

3455.2 --> 3459.839
where the sunlight comes from the

3457.839 --> 3462.48
direction because it's a directional

3459.839 --> 3465.599
it's a directional manifestation there's

3462.48 --> 3467.119
no heat source from which that all comes

3465.599 --> 3470.0
it's a

3467.119 --> 3472.48
the angular manifestation in relation to

3470.0 --> 3475.839
the observer and you see that apparent

3472.48 --> 3478.799
sun disk apparition at the focal point

3475.839 --> 3481.52
where the direction of the light comes

3478.799 --> 3484.079
from there's nothing actually there

3481.52 --> 3486.319
it's an apparition it's a hologram you

3484.079 --> 3489.3590000000004
see

3486.319 --> 3491.92
at the angle where the light comes from

3489.359 --> 3492.88
in relation to you as the observer on

3491.92 --> 3494.7200000000003
earth

3492.88 --> 3496.559
it's not actually an object you're

3494.72 --> 3498.3999999999996
looking at you're looking at a side

3496.559 --> 3500.559
effect

3498.4 --> 3502.2400000000002
of the light manifestation

3500.559 --> 3504.079
and that light manifestation is

3502.24 --> 3506.8799999999997
absolutely real everything is lit up

3504.079 --> 3508.559
around you because of that holographic

3506.88 --> 3511.44
light manifestation

3508.559 --> 3512.88
and the holographic light manifestation

3511.44 --> 3515.839
also

3512.88 --> 3518.319
is absorbed as

3515.839 --> 3519.92
partially

3518.319 --> 3522.16
so there is definitely heat absorbed

3519.92 --> 3524.7200000000003
it's just not radiating from anything

3522.16 --> 3527.839
because there's nothing there it's light

3524.72 --> 3530.72
manifest it's part of the design

3527.839 --> 3532.16
you cannot prove to the contrary

3530.72 --> 3534.72
because you have no proof of any

3532.16 --> 3537.52
euclidean nature object nature of the

3534.72 --> 3541.04
sun super elusive it doesn't abide by

3537.52 --> 3542.24
perspective it doesn't abide by the

3541.04 --> 3544.4
what is it

3542.24 --> 3546.8799999999997
in for square law it doesn't abide by

3544.4 --> 3548.559
anything that has a physical nature

3546.88 --> 3553.0
it's a hologram

3548.559 --> 3553.0
and you cannot prove the contrary

3559.119 --> 3565.359
who runs so hologram yeah you don't know

3562.16 --> 3567.839
you will never know [ __ ]

3565.359 --> 3570.48
it's not for you you're not supposed to

3567.839 --> 3572.48
know we're just supposed to figure out

3570.48 --> 3575.76
what it is and then

3572.48 --> 3577.599
eventually we might figure out like how

3575.76 --> 3580.079
how yeah

3577.599 --> 3582.4
let's first find out what

3580.079 --> 3584.88
sorry for calling you [ __ ] it's just

3582.4 --> 3586.88
i'm so sick of this endless six

3584.88 --> 3588.1600000000003
six-year-old response

3586.88 --> 3590.559
but

3588.16 --> 3595.7599999999998
if it's not what i thought it is

3590.559 --> 3599.3590000000004
i demand to immediately know every

3595.76 --> 3602.079
stupid little detail like right in front

3599.359 --> 3604.48
of the hands of god himself you must

3602.079 --> 3606.7200000000003
know it all

3604.48 --> 3608.559
yeah you can't

3606.72 --> 3611.4399999999996
you can't you need to be you need to

3608.559 --> 3615.3590000000004
stop being a spoiled little kid

3611.44 --> 3617.52
and stop this stupid demanding of

3615.359 --> 3620.799
knowing all the answers because you

3617.52 --> 3622.88
don't you were just fooled that you are

3620.799 --> 3625.92
by a bunch of wizards

3622.88 --> 3628.6400000000003
that are very good at spinning endless

3625.92 --> 3631.839
endless endless nonsense assertion

3628.64 --> 3634.48
stories until you literally fall asleep

3631.839 --> 3637.119
from it you're satisfied

3634.48 --> 3641.119
by the sheer preponderance of [ __ ]

3637.119 --> 3643.52
you're buried under as you inquire

3641.119 --> 3645.6800000000003
but how is it made it's their ultimate

3643.52 --> 3648.48
response to a six-year-old just tell

3645.68 --> 3651.52
them endless [ __ ] stories and then

3648.48 --> 3653.68
they'll stop asking why yeah yeah that's

3651.52 --> 3654.839
what it is that's what you're doing

3653.68 --> 3658.799
right

3654.839 --> 3661.599
now you don't know i don't know i'm not

3658.799 --> 3662.48
even concerned about knowing i just want

3661.599 --> 3664.559
to know

3662.48 --> 3667.599
what it is i see

3664.559 --> 3670.0
what is it really i don't care how

3667.599 --> 3671.92
that's possible i don't care at this

3670.0 --> 3674.4
point i just want to know what it is

3671.92 --> 3676.0
exactly and i especially want to know

3674.4 --> 3677.44
what it isn't

3676.0 --> 3680.48
yeah

3677.44 --> 3683.96
how does that work why who made it who

3680.48 --> 3683.96
gives a [ __ ]

3685.52 --> 3689.44
it's there

3686.96 --> 3690.799
and it's not an object and we got to

3689.44 --> 3694.16
deal with it

3690.799 --> 3696.16
you got to let go of your misconceptions

3694.16 --> 3699.5989999999997
i don't care

3696.16 --> 3703.1189999999997
that you need an alternative explanation

3699.599 --> 3705.44
for it all i don't give a [ __ ]

3703.119 --> 3706.6400000000003
i'm just gonna try to figure out what it

3705.44 --> 3709.359
is

3706.64 --> 3712.16
and then we'll see if we get beyond that

3709.359 --> 3714.0
point once we figure out what it is how

3712.16 --> 3716.5589999999997
did it get there how does it work who

3714.0 --> 3718.72
made it remember yeah it's none of my

3716.559 --> 3721.28
concern i just want to

3718.72 --> 3725.799
keep it real first yeah

3721.28 --> 3725.799
then we'll see how it came there

3731.28 --> 3734.28
alright

3740.48 --> 3743.68
what the hell

3741.76 --> 3746.3190000000004
i don't know clutch

3743.68 --> 3748.5589999999997
i think he's trying to support me i'm

3746.319 --> 3750.16
not sure what he's saying god made it

3748.559 --> 3751.52
yeah sure he made it it's there's a

3750.16 --> 3752.839
biblical

3751.52 --> 3756.079
description of

3752.839 --> 3758.16
it doesn't prove anything but there is a

3756.079 --> 3761.2000000000003
description of it and it doesn't

3758.16 --> 3764.0789999999997
indicate anything physical it indicates

3761.2 --> 3766.48
a light illuminary that's right

3764.079 --> 3771.2000000000003
sun is illuminary

3766.48 --> 3774.16
light based thing i think luminary

3771.2 --> 3776.799
is kind of an ancient word for natural

3774.16 --> 3776.799
hologram

3779.119 --> 3783.599
it's

3780.319 --> 3785.599
a light emanation that's a luminary

3783.599 --> 3789.48
light emanation that's kind of what it

3785.599 --> 3789.48
translates to i think

3806.4 --> 3811.6800000000003
what do you respond to yeah well i'd say

3809.68 --> 3813.44
like why the [ __ ] are you presupposing

3811.68 --> 3815.1189999999997
the earth to be a ball underneath the

3813.44 --> 3817.2000000000003
celestial sphere

3815.119 --> 3819.039
that's stupid

3817.2 --> 3821.52
it isn't

3819.039 --> 3823.44
just because the sky

3821.52 --> 3826.0
and the lights that you see in

3823.44 --> 3827.44
holographic fashion around you seem to

3826.0 --> 3829.44
be a sphere doesn't mean that you're

3827.44 --> 3832.4
standing on a sphere underneath all that

3829.44 --> 3832.4
that's [ __ ]

3836.72 --> 3839.839
it's all flat

3863.76 --> 3867.8390000000004
more info yeah

3865.68 --> 3870.16
yeah wendy is spiraling i already

3867.839 --> 3872.5589999999997
apologized for calling you that

3870.16 --> 3875.2
and i proceeded to spend like five

3872.559 --> 3877.52
minutes explaining exactly what i meant

3875.2 --> 3880.72
with hologram exactly

3877.52 --> 3884.64
but by standard baller fashion

3880.72 --> 3888.0789999999997
after i finish explaining the answer to

3884.64 --> 3890.48
your question of course then is when you

3888.079 --> 3893.92
ask the question

3890.48 --> 3896.2400000000002
after i just explained it which is like

3893.92 --> 3899.119
cookie cutter baller effect that's like

3896.24 --> 3900.8799999999997
what ballers do

3899.119 --> 3903.76
you explain it

3900.88 --> 3907.039
then they ask the question about what

3903.76 --> 3908.48
you just explained as if and probably

3907.039 --> 3911.5200000000004
they have

3908.48 --> 3913.52
completely missed out on what you said

3911.52 --> 3915.599
they don't even realize you're you've

3913.52 --> 3918.559
already answered the question that they

3915.599 --> 3921.3590000000004
then ask because they just don't listen

3918.559 --> 3923.92
they don't listen

3921.359 --> 3927.48
that's the ball you don't listen you

3923.92 --> 3927.48
never listen

3944.72 --> 3948.8799999999997
hey dan w then winfield

4034.64 --> 4038.48
literally don't care

4036.4 --> 4040.4
you're not even a person to me

4038.48 --> 4042.72
as far as i'm concerned you're a piece

4040.4 --> 4045.039
of algorithm that's programmed to get in

4042.72 --> 4047.9199999999996
my way

4045.039 --> 4050.1600000000003
whether that's a algorithm planted

4047.92 --> 4052.4
inside of a human being

4050.16 --> 4054.5589999999997
or whether you're a purely digital

4052.4 --> 4056.799
creation program i don't know and i

4054.559 --> 4058.6400000000003
don't care

4056.799 --> 4061.44
if you're just going to be outraged and

4058.64 --> 4063.52
like oh look at the fred arthur he found

4061.44 --> 4065.839
another baller for acting like a

4063.52 --> 4069.2
complete troll piece of [ __ ] scatter

4065.839 --> 4070.5589999999997
gunning straw manning moving on when

4069.2 --> 4072.319
actually getting the answer to their

4070.559 --> 4074.96
question to another question and forget

4072.319 --> 4077.119
about everything yeah yeah that's why i

4074.96 --> 4079.039
banned them yeah that's right you want

4077.119 --> 4083.28
to be one of those i mean it's very

4079.039 --> 4086.2400000000002
painful to be so overtly confronted

4083.28 --> 4087.599
with the idiocy of your position and

4086.24 --> 4090.0
your colleagues

4087.599 --> 4092.2400000000002
that i would want to be banned too

4090.0 --> 4094.319
because then i could finally have an

4092.24 --> 4096.5599999999995
excuse to get away and still be like

4094.319 --> 4099.6
yeah you burn me of course and then you

4096.56 --> 4103.4400000000005
can keep that idea in your mind

4099.6 --> 4105.759
to try to ride out the pain

4103.44 --> 4108.0
yeah that's okay with me

4105.759 --> 4110.96
i don't expect you to just

4108.0 --> 4113.279
be completely undefended

4110.96 --> 4116.719
from the pain

4113.279 --> 4119.1990000000005
of realizing you're a religiotard

4116.719 --> 4122.08
you're a religious zealot

4119.199 --> 4122.08
globe religion

4122.48 --> 4127.44
i don't expect you to not make up

4124.799 --> 4128.96
excuses for yourself because it hurts it

4127.44 --> 4131.3589999999995
does hurt

4128.96 --> 4135.52
just know that your excuses are not

4131.359 --> 4137.52
arguments they're just an excuse for you

4135.52 --> 4138.96
to kind of deal with the pain that's

4137.52 --> 4143.4400000000005
your pain

4138.96 --> 4143.44
because you believe in delusional things

4144.88 --> 4147.839
so yeah

4150.64 --> 4156.4800000000005
you can either hang around

4152.88 --> 4159.12
have a discussion listen pay attention

4156.48 --> 4162.239
and be part of the conversation

4159.12 --> 4165.2789999999995
maybe even argue for the globe or

4162.239 --> 4167.919999999999
i'd be happy to ban you

4165.279 --> 4173.400000000001
for being in

4167.92 --> 4173.4
just a whiny [ __ ] so it's up to you

4186.96 --> 4194.32
is seed planting is come on

4191.679 --> 4195.92
why doesn't this phone fall up instead

4194.32 --> 4198.4
of down

4195.92 --> 4201.04
because of relative density

4198.4 --> 4202.96
and relative doesn't mean the direction

4201.04 --> 4205.6
is relative it's

4202.96 --> 4209.28
the relation between the density of the

4205.6 --> 4212.56
object and the medium

4209.28 --> 4214.32
that's what the relative stands for it's

4212.56 --> 4218.159000000001
the relation

4214.32 --> 4221.759999999999
between the object and the medium

4218.159 --> 4223.199
and i know ballers have been very very

4221.76 --> 4224.679
petty or

4223.199 --> 4226.719
really

4224.679 --> 4227.64
unbelievably dumb

4226.719 --> 4229.679
to

4227.64 --> 4232.2390000000005
misunderstand that and think that

4229.679 --> 4235.4
relative relative density is a relative

4232.239 --> 4237.12
direction it's the dumbest

4235.4 --> 4240.4
misunderstanding

4237.12 --> 4243.76
in baller history

4240.4 --> 4247.28
it's the dumbest misunderstanding in

4243.76 --> 4249.679
baller history to think that relative in

4247.28 --> 4253.599999999999
relative density means a relative

4249.679 --> 4256.32
direction it's so dumb

4253.6 --> 4258.4800000000005
so dumb it's painful

4256.32 --> 4261.12
every time somebody brings that up

4258.48 --> 4264.159
and that you actually think that by

4261.12 --> 4267.12
mentioning it you have some kind of

4264.159 --> 4270.12
angle of approach for an argument are

4267.12 --> 4270.12
you

4283.92 --> 4287.36
right anyway i'm gonna take a two minute

4286.32 --> 4290.84
break

4287.36 --> 4290.839999999999
be right back

4300.239 --> 4303.239
what

4371.04 --> 4376.5199999999995
and i'm back

4372.96 --> 4376.52
and you're banned

4399.84 --> 4403.92
what is this people putting the void

4402.0 --> 4407.36
thing that's advertisement that's

4403.92 --> 4409.36
literally like scam advertisement it's

4407.36 --> 4411.599999999999
been going around a lot in comment

4409.36 --> 4414.239
sections and chats now

4411.6 --> 4416.56
so every time you see that there's a dot

4414.239 --> 4420.0
in there don't forget clutch every time

4416.56 --> 4424.159000000001
you see that instantly ban always

4420.0 --> 4424.159
it's a bot it's literally a

4424.8 --> 4431.28
like a hostile at ad bot when that

4428.48 --> 4434.32
happens instantly ben always

4431.28 --> 4436.0
always it's never a person never it's

4434.32 --> 4438.159
always a bot

4436.0 --> 4440.08
instant ban

4438.159 --> 4442.48
every time you see that no matter where

4440.08 --> 4442.48
you are

4449.199 --> 4453.839999999999
and they pop up everywhere everywhere

4453.04 --> 4457.44
in

4453.84 --> 4459.6
comment sections all over the place news

4457.44 --> 4462.4
websites

4459.6 --> 4463.92
comment like even

4462.4 --> 4466.719
like

4463.92 --> 4469.84
smaller news websites everywhere where

4466.719 --> 4472.56
there's a forum they get in everywhere

4469.84 --> 4475.1990000000005
it's an ad bot

4472.56 --> 4477.360000000001
and i like i spend time

4475.199 --> 4479.678999999999
removing and flagging those even in

4477.36 --> 4482.679
places that aren't even like flat earth

4479.679 --> 4482.679
related

4483.199 --> 4488.799999999999
because they're in everyone's way

4486.32 --> 4492.96
nobody that actually stupid enough to go

4488.8 --> 4492.96
there ends up happier

4494.239 --> 4500.639999999999
it is porn uh okay

4498.4 --> 4500.639999999999
right

4501.92 --> 4506.64
i didn't know that george sanford i

4504.08 --> 4510.36
guess you actually checked it out i

4506.64 --> 4510.360000000001
didn't need to know

4519.6 --> 4523.679
i said yesterday but you responded with

4522.0 --> 4527.92
your best

4523.679 --> 4527.92
ace ventura oh really

4533.679 --> 4541.12
i said that you said what yesterday

4538.159 --> 4541.12
who are you talking to

4546.08 --> 4550.4
what are you talking i don't even know

4547.44 --> 4550.4
what you're talking about

4550.88 --> 4557.679
you said that yesterday what what that

4555.199 --> 4560.0
yes what did you say yesterday

4557.679 --> 4563.12
and i say over here

4560.0 --> 4565.04
to a whole bunch of things so

4563.12 --> 4567.04
and it said then just suggest oh that's

4565.04 --> 4570.08
because i'm a baller i don't even know

4567.04 --> 4570.08
what you're talking about

4570.64 --> 4577.92
my explanation of the weird comment

4574.08 --> 4577.92
you mean the bot the ad bot

4578.08 --> 4582.8
okay well i didn't know you were talking

4580.4 --> 4584.96
about that because if that's what you

4582.8 --> 4587.04
would have been talking about then i

4584.96 --> 4589.28
wouldn't have said that

4587.04 --> 4592.08
because i've known about that stupid bot

4589.28 --> 4593.679
thing for a long time so i must have

4592.08 --> 4595.28
thought you were talking about something

4593.679 --> 4597.04
else

4595.28 --> 4599.12
because i wouldn't

4597.04 --> 4600.56
if that was obviously what you were

4599.12 --> 4602.239
talking about

4600.56 --> 4605.280000000001
if i had picked up on that then i

4602.239 --> 4608.5599999999995
wouldn't have responded like that

4605.28 --> 4611.36
so but yeah sometimes i misread things

4608.56 --> 4613.4400000000005
it happens especially when it's like

4611.36 --> 4615.5199999999995
when it gets a bit heated then i

4613.44 --> 4618.0
sometimes read things wrong and i fit

4615.52 --> 4620.159000000001
like i'm still thinking i'm kind of like

4618.0 --> 4621.44
when i get in heavy discussions i start

4620.159 --> 4623.5199999999995
to

4621.44 --> 4625.839999999999
basically assume that everybody's

4623.52 --> 4628.320000000001
talking about what i'm talking about i

4625.84 --> 4630.4800000000005
kind of expect people to do that in my

4628.32 --> 4632.4
chat but then they just start talking

4630.48 --> 4634.718999999999
about other things in the middle of like

4632.4 --> 4636.879999999999
a long explanation

4634.719 --> 4638.8
and then yeah then i can mistakenly

4636.88 --> 4640.88
think that you were actually talking

4638.8 --> 4642.4800000000005
about what i was talking about it

4640.88 --> 4644.32
happens

4642.48 --> 4646.5599999999995
yeah it's not because you're a baller

4644.32 --> 4648.08
that's because i mistakenly thought you

4646.56 --> 4649.6
were talking about the thing that i was

4648.08 --> 4651.12
talking about

4649.6 --> 4652.719
all right

4651.12 --> 4655.719
hope that clears things up logical

4652.719 --> 4655.719
conclusion

4678.88 --> 4684.4800000000005
what are my favorite non-fe channel

4682.08 --> 4684.48
sites

4684.8 --> 4687.8
ah

4694.0 --> 4696.64
i don't know

4697.44 --> 4704.239
i mean i follow things but to call it my

4700.64 --> 4707.360000000001
favorite no like all media things that i

4704.239 --> 4709.36
follow all have ups and downs

4707.36 --> 4710.96
times where they're terrible and times

4709.36 --> 4713.199
when they're great

4710.96 --> 4715.04
i can't really say i have a favorite in

4713.199 --> 4717.12
there

4715.04 --> 4719.84
but when it comes to like media things

4717.12 --> 4721.12
that i followed the longest i'd say alex

4719.84 --> 4723.04
jones

4721.12 --> 4725.599999999999
i've definitely followed him for a very

4723.04 --> 4725.6
long time

4726.88 --> 4729.6
and

4731.679 --> 4735.6
yeah on top of that natural news but i

4733.36 --> 4738.48
don't really visit it that much but i do

4735.6 --> 4740.88
regard it as a like a valuable source

4738.48 --> 4744.159
but a witch

4740.88 --> 4744.159000000001
watch a bit of rt

4744.48 --> 4750.48
and i yeah the dutch alternative news

4747.28 --> 4751.599999999999
website knowing for news it's called

4750.48 --> 4755.28
because

4751.6 --> 4758.320000000001
well i actually used to visit these guys

4755.28 --> 4758.32
and they're like pretty

4758.88 --> 4764.400000000001
like

4760.64 --> 4766.8
they're a little bit conspiracy

4764.4 --> 4769.36
that little bit they're very conspiracy

4766.8 --> 4769.360000000001
oriented

4770.4 --> 4775.96
but still they just dig around a lot

4781.6 --> 4785.679
so yeah those are kind of my sources a

4784.08 --> 4788.239
bit

4785.679 --> 4790.32
uh yeah and then there's like completely

4788.239 --> 4792.5599999999995
different things

4790.32 --> 4792.5599999999995
like

4792.719 --> 4797.76
movie reviewers that have absolutely

4795.76 --> 4800.0
nothing to do with really anything else

4797.76 --> 4803.280000000001
but movies and series

4800.0 --> 4805.84
i've been following them for

4803.28 --> 4805.84
15 years

4807.76 --> 4812.639
but yeah they are they're very

4810.08 --> 4813.5199999999995
leftist in ways

4812.639 --> 4816.84
very

4813.52 --> 4820.2390000000005
hipsterish by now

4816.84 --> 4822.56
but yeah

4820.239 --> 4825.12
let's see what it is

4822.56 --> 4827.76
and they call it these days

4825.12 --> 4830.84
yeah channel awesome

4827.76 --> 4835.1990000000005
and originally partnered with them

4830.84 --> 4835.1990000000005
phelous he's a really silly

4835.44 --> 4840.4
like

4836.159 --> 4841.92
he reviews like really weird

4840.4 --> 4843.839999999999
movies that

4841.92 --> 4845.679
like cartoons that like literally

4843.84 --> 4846.56
nobody's ever heard of because they're

4845.679 --> 4849.76
so

4846.56 --> 4852.88
they're terribly made and it's i find it

4849.76 --> 4856.2390000000005
like amusing to no end

4852.88 --> 4858.2390000000005
uh so those yeah that's

4856.239 --> 4861.679999999999
some of the things that i typically

4858.239 --> 4864.7699999999995
watch over the decades

4861.68 --> 4864.77
[Music]

4865.6 --> 4870.320000000001
other than that i can't think of

4867.28 --> 4870.32
something right now

4873.199 --> 4877.5199999999995
one three four four what does that mean

4885.679 --> 4893.52
you think alex is a shill

4889.84 --> 4893.52
well he's a media operator

4894.4 --> 4898.638999999999
he absolutely

4896.639 --> 4901.639
is part of narratives

4898.639 --> 4901.639
yes

4902.159 --> 4906.879999999999
so is he a shill no that word

4905.52 --> 4909.6
i don't

4906.88 --> 4911.52
that word's like very like a shill is

4909.6 --> 4914.4800000000005
not even a real thing

4911.52 --> 4916.400000000001
it's more like an action you can do

4914.48 --> 4918.718999999999
what defines a chill

4916.4 --> 4920.879999999999
is somebody who basically acts like

4918.719 --> 4923.92
something purely for the payment and

4920.88 --> 4926.08
they're not actually behind

4923.92 --> 4927.36
what they're promoting right that would

4926.08 --> 4930.639
be a shill

4927.36 --> 4934.799999999999
alex doesn't do that

4930.639 --> 4934.8
he just really believes in that [ __ ]

4936.48 --> 4940.959999999999
which is kind of crazy

4938.32 --> 4943.759999999999
but then again he has that weird baller

4940.96 --> 4945.52
mindset that he'll he'll never let go of

4943.76 --> 4947.360000000001
like everybody around him could be a

4945.52 --> 4949.360000000001
flat earther

4947.36 --> 4951.759999999999
like his own crew could be that and he

4949.36 --> 4955.679
just wouldn't give a [ __ ] he's never

4951.76 --> 4957.76
gonna give up he's on his

4955.679 --> 4960.08
idea narrative and things that he

4957.76 --> 4962.8
believes in and he will never let go he

4960.08 --> 4963.76
will never

4962.8 --> 4964.96
never

4963.76 --> 4966.08
start

4964.96 --> 4966.96
stop

4966.08 --> 4969.44
like

4966.96 --> 4972.4
blaming islam

4969.44 --> 4975.04
for like all these perverts

4972.4 --> 4977.04
out there that come out of those regions

4975.04 --> 4979.92
he will always

4977.04 --> 4982.56
always say islam is evil islam is evil

4979.92 --> 4984.84
he will always say he will never stop

4982.56 --> 4988.4800000000005
doing that never he would

4984.84 --> 4991.28
die to reinforce that idea

4988.48 --> 4993.28
right and that's complete insanity it's

4991.28 --> 4995.36
completely insane

4993.28 --> 4998.08
but that's what he does

4995.36 --> 5000.799999999999
that's what he's decided upon he decided

4998.08 --> 5003.04
it is the enemy

5000.8 --> 5003.04
right

5003.12 --> 5006.8
that's it that's one of those things

5007.12 --> 5012.32
it's completely insane

5010.159 --> 5016.159
but he's decided that is it

5012.32 --> 5019.599999999999
he decided that all those freaky

5016.159 --> 5021.199
cave grabblers that have been fleeing

5019.6 --> 5023.4400000000005
out of the

5021.199 --> 5026.4
arab regions and all that

5023.44 --> 5028.32
they're basically cave grabblers

5026.4 --> 5031.12
they hide in caves they're grabblers

5028.32 --> 5032.88
they're disgusting pedo

5031.12 --> 5036.08
i don't even want to know what they all

5032.88 --> 5038.8
like doing right those people go to

5036.08 --> 5041.28
other countries like the to england

5038.8 --> 5043.679
and start like kidnapping kids and

5041.28 --> 5045.28
disgusting [ __ ] and all that yeah those

5043.679 --> 5046.96
are not

5045.28 --> 5049.04
muslims

5046.96 --> 5050.88
those people

5049.04 --> 5054.239
when caught

5050.88 --> 5057.04
in muslim countries would immediately

5054.239 --> 5058.879999999999
be executed immediately

5057.04 --> 5062.719
yeah they're not

5058.88 --> 5064.08
[ __ ] muslims okay alex [ __ ]

5062.719 --> 5066.4800000000005
they're not

5064.08 --> 5069.719
muslims

5066.48 --> 5069.718999999999
get it

5073.36 --> 5082.199
they're cave grabbler monsters and they

5076.32 --> 5082.199
should be executed all of them wiped out

5087.92 --> 5090.2390000000005
ah

5097.12 --> 5103.12
as alex ever said the earth is flat no

5100.0 --> 5105.52
only in sarcasm

5103.12 --> 5108.08
and he likes doing that

5105.52 --> 5110.320000000001
he likes to be he likes to be he's just

5108.08 --> 5110.32
so

5110.56 --> 5116.96
he's so freaking nasabound guys he he is

5114.239 --> 5118.959999999999
literally in contract with nasa i'm

5116.96 --> 5123.36
pretty damn sure of that like he has

5118.96 --> 5123.36
literal contracts with nasa right

5123.52 --> 5129.4400000000005
and he does that stupid [ __ ]

5126.719 --> 5132.0
every now and then where he's like oh

5129.44 --> 5134.0
oh we're gonna talk about things that

5132.0 --> 5136.239
are obviously fake so this is fake and

5134.0 --> 5138.84
that is fake and yeah of course the

5136.239 --> 5141.44
earth is flat he does that

5138.84 --> 5145.28
[ __ ] he's done that

5141.44 --> 5147.04
quite a few times over the decade

5145.28 --> 5148.96
right

5147.04 --> 5153.32
he really

5148.96 --> 5153.32
really doesn't like flat earth

5156.08 --> 5160.5599999999995
yeah alex still calls her home yeah of

5158.0 --> 5163.28
course he's full in on the lingo and

5160.56 --> 5164.639
he's always talking about we need to

5163.28 --> 5168.48
stand up

5164.639 --> 5170.639
and reach for the stores always always

5168.48 --> 5173.678999999999
he's never gonna let go ever ever ever

5170.639 --> 5176.4800000000005
ever ever ever he will die for that

5173.679 --> 5177.679
belief okay no matter how [ __ ] that

5176.48 --> 5180.959999999999
will seem

5177.679 --> 5183.76
in the future he will die for it

5180.96 --> 5186.56
my crazy old grandpa

5183.76 --> 5189.360000000001
and his crazy belief

5186.56 --> 5189.360000000001
that's what it is

5195.12 --> 5197.84
right

5198.8 --> 5202.28
anything else

5215.6 --> 5220.320000000001
uh likes dust science fiction channel

5218.32 --> 5224.239
yeah no

5220.32 --> 5226.639
i like this one video on there a lot

5224.239 --> 5228.5599999999995
like the mini series

5226.639 --> 5231.12
i really like that one

5228.56 --> 5233.04
but i i am subscribed to it slow mo moon

5231.12 --> 5234.0
buggy but i'm not constantly digging

5233.04 --> 5237.32
through it

5234.0 --> 5237.32
to the contrary

5238.08 --> 5242.0
but i just see it as like a giant

5240.4 --> 5244.638999999999
collection of

5242.0 --> 5246.639
small sci-fi novels

5244.639 --> 5248.4800000000005
the dust channel

5246.639 --> 5250.0
to which i am subscribed

5248.48 --> 5251.678999999999
and it's just when i'm in the mood for

5250.0 --> 5255.679
it

5251.679 --> 5255.679
i'm not like constantly watching those

5256.239 --> 5263.4
i've only figured out about them very

5258.48 --> 5263.4
recently like in the last half year so

5284.32 --> 5287.28
what

5285.44 --> 5289.36
you didn't have to retract the message

5287.28 --> 5291.92
oh wait you didn't wait what

5289.36 --> 5293.679
sorry just

5291.92 --> 5295.84
getting a little disoriented with chat

5293.679 --> 5295.84
here

5301.6 --> 5306.04
most media won't admit duh

5309.52 --> 5314.88
like i mean

5310.8 --> 5317.92
the globe is designated to be the

5314.88 --> 5319.28
fictional medium for media

5317.92 --> 5321.679
that's what they

5319.28 --> 5324.639
attempted like the people

5321.679 --> 5326.0
even setting up radio communication and

5324.639 --> 5331.4400000000005
television

5326.0 --> 5331.44
they were absolutely adamant about that

5332.08 --> 5339.12
absolutely adamant like it is the

5335.28 --> 5341.759999999999
designated fictional medium for the

5339.12 --> 5343.84
media universe it probably has legal

5341.76 --> 5345.280000000001
implications too

5343.84 --> 5347.360000000001
because if you're gonna talk about

5345.28 --> 5350.719
something in a fictional medium then you

5347.36 --> 5353.12
could probably it's really critical a

5350.719 --> 5355.44
certain moment in time

5353.12 --> 5357.04
point out but i was just talking about a

5355.44 --> 5357.919999999999
fictional medium

5357.04 --> 5360.4
right

5357.92 --> 5362.0
it might be because of that i don't know

5360.4 --> 5365.199
but i know

5362.0 --> 5367.52
that all the media

5365.199 --> 5371.12
from the very start

5367.52 --> 5374.0
was absolutely designated to be taking

5371.12 --> 5377.28
place in the globe universe

5374.0 --> 5379.36
always since the very start that's what

5377.28 --> 5383.12
how they set it up

5379.36 --> 5385.36
they did a lot to reinforce it

5383.12 --> 5387.12
and that's what it is so

5385.36 --> 5388.96
to expect

5387.12 --> 5390.88
any media

5388.96 --> 5392.8
that's gonna get some kind of reach out

5390.88 --> 5394.08
there to be flat earth is kind of

5392.8 --> 5397.360000000001
ridiculous

5394.08 --> 5400.08
it really is ridiculous and it is

5397.36 --> 5402.239
like a pointless hope to have

5400.08 --> 5405.76
pointless

5402.239 --> 5408.239
because the globe universe is the media

5405.76 --> 5408.2390000000005
medium

5409.679 --> 5413.84
and

5410.96 --> 5416.159
there's so much reinforcement for it

5413.84 --> 5419.04
like for over a century

5416.159 --> 5423.759999999999
i don't see how that will ever stop

5419.04 --> 5423.76
ever you see even in a hundred years

5427.52 --> 5431.84
there's too much narrative

5429.6 --> 5433.360000000001
potential there's too many options with

5431.84 --> 5435.4400000000005
the globe

5433.36 --> 5438.5599999999995
to let it go

5435.44 --> 5441.44
because it is like the media it

5438.56 --> 5444.159000000001
and the globe in there it's a

5441.44 --> 5447.28
political tool it's a tool

5444.159 --> 5449.44
to quickly make up a [ __ ] story

5447.28 --> 5450.48
and then force people to abide to that

5449.44 --> 5453.44
story

5450.48 --> 5457.44
it's with the viruses now

5453.44 --> 5459.44
it's with global warming it's all

5457.44 --> 5460.32
based on

5459.44 --> 5462.5599999999995
the

5460.32 --> 5464.0
globe universe

5462.56 --> 5466.2390000000005
medium

5464.0 --> 5468.159
do you understand that's that's not just

5466.239 --> 5470.08
something random i just said that's

5468.159 --> 5471.839999999999
literally true

5470.08 --> 5473.44
it's all based

5471.84 --> 5475.679
globe universe

5473.44 --> 5478.799999999999
based model

5475.679 --> 5481.28
viruses climate change both

5478.8 --> 5483.52
they exist exclusively in the

5481.28 --> 5486.88
heliocentric universe

5483.52 --> 5486.88
the fictional one

5488.4 --> 5493.5599999999995
that's why sci-fi is always riddled with

5490.56 --> 5493.56
that
