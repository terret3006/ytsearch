2.6 --> 9.9
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.72 --> 12.899999999999999
early-bird number 18 I'm your host

9.9 --> 17.759
Arwen starting out today I have no

12.9 --> 24.93
guests yet but expecting them to pop by

17.759 --> 28.98
as the show goes along so how is

24.93 --> 33.480000000000004
everyone doing it's really cold and

28.98 --> 37.44
cloudy no yesterday night it's just this

33.48 --> 42.36
giant haze overlaying everything it's

37.44 --> 46.489999999999995
not too Pleasant outside very cold but

42.36 --> 52.92
yeah inside it's okay and I have my

46.49 --> 55.77
heater right there so it's perfectly

52.92 --> 57.989000000000004
fine as long as I wear two t-shirts at

55.77 --> 67.47
the same time if I go anywhere I'm gonna

57.989 --> 71.39999999999999
freeze up but yeah there is so much to

67.47 --> 75.28999999999999
talk about but I don't really have a

71.4 --> 79.07000000000001
good order of things in my head and

75.29 --> 85.58000000000001
before the show I was just working on

79.07 --> 88.08
designing more stuff for my D&D campaign

85.58 --> 90.86
getting some more inspiration for that

88.08 --> 94.44
usually happens during this time of year

90.86 --> 98.78
it's a good distraction it's good to

94.44 --> 101.64
have a focus just dive in there and

98.78 --> 102.75
design some things that could be

101.64 --> 107.369
interesting

102.75 --> 110.189
but yeah I've been also think yeah a lot

107.369 --> 115.56
of things things that kind of worry me

110.189 --> 118.40899999999999
and make me realize that despite

115.56 --> 124.409
everything to serve on certain levels

118.409 --> 130.079
that I am still influenced or by peer

124.409 --> 132.18
pressure and in a way that is still yeah

130.079 --> 134.61
I would say it's kind of disappointing

132.18 --> 138.42000000000002
to me but

134.61 --> 144.20000000000002
the other hand yeah you you can't just

138.42 --> 144.2
oppose everything it's not good

144.23 --> 151.97
just everything everything everything no

147.35 --> 157.59
that's you turn into an a-list anyway

151.97 --> 161.18
nihilist but I have been pondering a bit

157.59 --> 171.23000000000002
about more about the Roman Empire and

161.18 --> 175.05
Jesus Christ and it is almost like a

171.23 --> 178.73899999999998
just an uncomfortable realization that

175.05 --> 182.58
if the Roman Empire as portrayed in

178.739 --> 185.42000000000002
history wasn't really that as it was

182.58 --> 185.42000000000002
then

185.69 --> 192.87
yeah how much basically of the Roman

189.84 --> 201.049
involvement parts with Christ is really

192.87 --> 204.33
what that was was the Romans suggests he

201.049 --> 207.959
was it just like a regional governor it

204.33 --> 213.44
kind of does fit in what I suspect the

207.959 --> 216.51
Romans were just a group of vicious

213.44 --> 221.60999999999999
conquerors probably using fascist

216.51 --> 225.45
technologies and but not as big as later

221.61 --> 229.08
would be assumed that did conquered

225.45 --> 233.19
nations and just put a man in into a

229.08 --> 236.91000000000003
ruling position and that is very much

233.19 --> 238.92
like how Nazareth where everything

236.91 --> 244.049
basically happened surrounding Christ

238.92 --> 248.48899999999998
it does conform to that model so maybe

244.049 --> 251.43
the Roman Empire was in another fashion

248.489 --> 255.229
really present then and price was

251.43 --> 259.47
involved so how much did really happen

255.229 --> 261.63
of this story and it's a very painful

259.47 --> 265.02000000000004
question to ask because there's so much

261.63 --> 269.009
so many Christians that

265.02 --> 271.62
absolutely adamantly hold on to the

269.009 --> 273.81
details in this and that are also just

271.62 --> 277.77
carefully looking around but there seems

273.81 --> 281.759
to be kind of a fear of being wrong

277.77 --> 284.46
about it or doubting some of the

281.759 --> 288.659
fundaments of what fundamentals of what

284.46 --> 291.27
has happened and in this part now that

288.659 --> 294.36
I'm being confronted with this I'm kind

291.27 --> 298.349
of glad about my own approach the path

294.36 --> 300.389
of Christ because it doesn't really

298.349 --> 302.25
matter to the path of Christ what really

300.389 --> 305.159
happened the only thing that matters is

302.25 --> 308.19
about what we know off Christ and how he

305.159 --> 312.63
dealt with things it's kind of his

308.19 --> 317.78
attitude his his anger his spirit the

312.63 --> 320.93
Spirit of God and that is the thing yet

317.78 --> 324.23999999999995
it's kind of like with with

320.93 --> 325.889
overgeneralizing but with life you know

324.24 --> 328.02
you have a certain expectation

325.889 --> 331.169
especially when you're young and you

328.02 --> 333.50899999999996
reflect upon other people and on TV and

331.169 --> 335.31
you form an image of what it could be

333.509 --> 339.12
like how you could be when you're older

335.31 --> 342.18
and then when you actually go through

339.12 --> 348.029
the entire thing it rarely turns out to

342.18 --> 350.009
be what you expected and I think that

348.029 --> 352.979
maybe the christ thing is very similar

350.009 --> 356.219
it is just he was really doing the right

352.979 --> 358.349
thing and he was like possessed by the

356.219 --> 361.669
Spirit of God sent by him however you

358.349 --> 363.74
want to see it he did good was a

361.669 --> 369.029
magnificent example

363.74 --> 373.68
destined for Humanity but yeah might

369.029 --> 381.09
have been just not what we're told but

373.68 --> 384.99
still significant and important and it's

381.09 --> 387.659
a it's such a loaded subject probably

384.99 --> 391.19
already pissing off a whole damn lot of

387.659 --> 395.58
people some of which I will care about

391.19 --> 398.43
like I don't really care about you say

395.58 --> 401.90999999999997
devil persecutors as I call them Chris

398.43 --> 405.21
that are that are just obsessed with the

401.91 --> 409.86
devil and with people supposedly acting

405.21 --> 412.83
in his name that's just the the other

409.86 --> 416.28000000000003
end of the spectrum where you shouldn't

412.83 --> 418.26
be going it's when you fight the enemy

416.28 --> 420.9
long enough you become the enemy that

418.26 --> 427.7
kind of situation so I don't care about

420.9 --> 430.65
those people but I I guess I do kind of

427.7 --> 433.22999999999996
socially consider myself a Christian and

430.65 --> 436.85999999999996
I don't want to be like shunned by every

433.23 --> 439.29
single one of these people so I hope

436.86 --> 445.74
that my dedication to the path of Christ

439.29 --> 449.70000000000005
as I see it is good enough and know them

445.74 --> 453.93
by their deeds I guess and then there's

449.7 --> 456.18
the whole debacle about magic what is

453.93 --> 458.43
really magic how would you consider

456.18 --> 462.35
magic is magic

458.43 --> 465.75
by default evil anything ethereal any

462.35 --> 468.66
supernatural sense any foresight is that

465.75 --> 469.56
all magic is that all evil makes me very

468.66 --> 472.59000000000003
uncomfortable

469.56 --> 478.68
if that would be the case with because I

472.59 --> 482.34
would be in big trouble as I hope in the

478.68 --> 485.06
light and not basically interacting with

482.34 --> 490.04999999999995
dark spirits absolutely evading that

485.06 --> 496.64
they trust me they try to just do good

490.05 --> 500.1
things and to like use extrasensory

496.64 --> 504.47999999999996
perception you could call it to gather

500.1 --> 507.90000000000003
information and help people with that

504.48 --> 510.23
like it's very hard for a person to

507.9 --> 512.91
really see the path they're going

510.23 --> 517.79
because they're tied up into short-term

512.91 --> 520.38
decisions but for another like I somehow

517.79 --> 524.55
yeah if they open up to me then I can

520.38 --> 527.22
see so much yeah who they really are

524.55 --> 531.8299999999999
basically it's it it's so complex it's

527.22 --> 531.83
mystical in a way to me even but

533.17 --> 540.05
yeah you should use that in a positive

536.689 --> 543.11
way like try to warn them like okay I

540.05 --> 544.7299999999999
see that you will probably be going in

543.11 --> 548.42
this direction is this really where

544.73 --> 550.399
you're going and if my analysis my

548.42 --> 552.769
insight was correct and they will

550.399 --> 554.75
understand exactly what I mean they will

552.769 --> 557.0600000000001
have this feeling and I will basically

554.75 --> 559.399
be reminding them of what they keep

557.06 --> 563.18
dormant or hidden inside of them

559.399 --> 567.1
that's good confrontation it makes the

563.18 --> 570.05
choice more clear doesn't allow you to

567.1 --> 571.279
uphold the illusion long enough that you

570.05 --> 576.1289999999999
do not have a choice

571.279 --> 576.129
so you just drift into a position and

576.639 --> 582.41
you had a lot of people do that and I

579.769 --> 584.389
want to help as many people to prevent

582.41 --> 588.649
basically doing it and stay on the path

584.389 --> 590.87
stay on the aware choice know that you

588.649 --> 593.839
always have choices in things and

590.87 --> 597.559
there's usually more directions you

593.839 --> 600.4300000000001
could go at then you thought or then you

597.559 --> 604.189
think you could handle especially

600.43 --> 606.709
because people tend to take more

604.189 --> 609.439
pressure on their shoulders of the same

606.709 --> 612.29
kind because they're used to it that's

609.439 --> 613.79
like yeah usually it hits a critical

612.29 --> 617.269
mass and then they just break under it

613.79 --> 620.7199999999999
but people will not be inclined so much

617.269 --> 622.79
to try a radically new angles of

620.72 --> 624.98
approach there's some people that are

622.79 --> 627.079
just really naturally good at that and

624.98 --> 631.129
they amaze everyone usually or

627.079 --> 633.1389999999999
terrifying but many people have just a

631.129 --> 637.25
lot of trouble trying new things out and

633.139 --> 640.5790000000001
that's extra scary to them and but if

637.25 --> 643.22
you can help them find the courage for

640.579 --> 646.6099999999999
these things or overcome such inner

643.22 --> 650.0590000000001
obstacle then they will have a valuable

646.61 --> 652.399
new angle to approach things with and to

650.059 --> 655.85
sustain what they're going to be doing

652.399 --> 657.709
in the rest of their lives and I can do

655.85 --> 659.269
this I can help with that and I have

657.709 --> 664.43
helped people with that I'm very happy

659.269 --> 667.61
and I I hope it's enough for the Creator

664.43 --> 669.9499999999999
and I guess that on a feeling level most

667.61 --> 672.59
people probably be sympathetic and just

669.95 --> 676.61
understand yeah yeah but it's not just

672.59 --> 681.73
that like there's just this higher

676.61 --> 685.36
standard and I still feel but I I'm

681.73 --> 687.98
getting there but I'm not there yet and

685.36 --> 693.95
there's still some problems that I need

687.98 --> 696.83
to work out with society and figure out

693.95 --> 699.86
what's really really important what are

696.83 --> 703.45
the most important parts about what you

699.86 --> 705.77
should be doing as a human under

703.45 --> 710.5400000000001
circumstances because the problem also

705.77 --> 713.18
is with like for example the what is it

710.54 --> 716.0899999999999
the ten commandments and all the other

713.18 --> 720.56
things that spring for from from it and

716.09 --> 724.73
interpretations is that it's very direct

720.56 --> 728.4799999999999
but yeah societal circumstances have

724.73 --> 732.5
become so complex now that certain sins

728.48 --> 737.66
are almost demanded of people just to

732.5 --> 740.69
get along and it's hard very difficult

737.66 --> 744.11
not to do that and yep I've already done

740.69 --> 746.6600000000001
a lot of effort and investment and

744.11 --> 748.34
sacrifices to basically already step

746.66 --> 750.4599999999999
away from most of these things but

748.34 --> 753.65
there's still some elements that just

750.46 --> 758.72
I'm still in this society and still have

753.65 --> 760.9599999999999
to deal with it you can't be mr. perfect

758.72 --> 763.49
always everyone will start hating you

760.96 --> 766.94
especially if you pronounce it like that

763.49 --> 771.05
of course but if an if you can never do

766.94 --> 773.6600000000001
anything wrong or associates then you're

771.05 --> 776.06
completely isolated in this world right

773.66 --> 779.65
now with the brainwashing everywhere it

776.06 --> 779.65
just idiocy

780.04 --> 785.8399999999999
so anyway getting a really complex for

784.07 --> 790.25
this morning I'm gonna look at chat for

785.84 --> 795.5600000000001
a moment yeah a lot has been on my men

790.25 --> 796.31
safe to say let's see was a chat Daniel

795.56 --> 798.31
field

796.31 --> 809.2199999999999
we're on Thorson trouble

798.31 --> 809.2199999999999
and there's this see you Michael be dank

810.36 --> 819.269
now if you guys been busy in chat Ronny

814.24 --> 819.269
Foshee thanks for a compliment

819.5 --> 823.049
[Music]

842.279 --> 848.61
I think you guys I'm just reading

846.149 --> 850.29
silently because people are responding

848.61 --> 853.74
to what I said and they really get it

850.29 --> 858.7199999999999
that the complexities of it all it's

853.74 --> 860.37
just a split off of a split off or split

858.72 --> 867.35
off everything's become so convoluted

860.37 --> 870.48
it's what you feel is the right thing

867.35 --> 873.4200000000001
because of details because of minority

870.48 --> 877.35
the little thing is here and there

873.42 --> 878.91
because of societal habits is it really

877.35 --> 881.7900000000001
all the right thing just because it

878.91 --> 885.48
feels that if you get used to it you

881.79 --> 888.18
know evil people also get used to doing

885.48 --> 890.4200000000001
evil things and they stop considering

888.18 --> 893.309
these things as evil even though they

890.42 --> 897.809
literally experience them as such at

893.309 --> 903.329
first and then chose to not to ignore

897.809 --> 912.74
them so it's difficult it's very very

903.329 --> 916.17
difficult and it's hard to work with but

912.74 --> 918.36
yeah I guess that the good path the

916.17 --> 921.4799999999999
righteous path is always the harder one

918.36 --> 923.73
it's never the easy one and I still

921.48 --> 927.9590000000001
believe it like I've been doing this for

923.73 --> 930.72
so long now and really focused in the

927.959 --> 934.6199999999999
last three years really really focused

930.72 --> 937.019
on the it's keeping upholding it even

934.62 --> 941.779
more even stronger more passionate more

937.019 --> 946.47
radical towards myself mostly and it

941.779 --> 948.889
does work makes things tougher but you

946.47 --> 952.649
adapt to that and the energy of

948.889 --> 956.48
upholding it fuels that adaptation and

952.649 --> 960.54
makes it a lot easier and then other

956.48 --> 962.79
doors open just other people that

960.54 --> 968.069
normally wouldn't have approached me

962.79 --> 969.8389999999999
years ago certainly look at me see me

968.069 --> 974.25
standing as somebody that they can

969.839 --> 977.24
approach and even

974.25 --> 981.57
even now sometimes I am shocked by this

977.24 --> 984.8100000000001
because like 10 years ago in the gothic

981.57 --> 985.6500000000001
scene and everything I was not like this

984.81 --> 989.5799999999999
at all

985.65 --> 992.61
and I would expect and I was also kind

989.58 --> 995.7900000000001
of paranoid because I had taken on this

992.61 --> 998.73
dream image of myself that carried over

995.79 --> 1002.78
from my youth I always thought bad of

998.73 --> 1006.35
myself like and I believed in nasty

1002.78 --> 1010.1
people that told me I was a bad kid and

1006.35 --> 1013.88
all that stuff I believe them that was a

1010.1 --> 1017.39
big problem that I believe was I took it

1013.88 --> 1021.56
and shouldn't have but yeah it's crazy

1017.39 --> 1023.96
times my youth and that always made me

1021.56 --> 1026.329
like yeah everybody hates me or they all

1023.96 --> 1028.79
see something wrong with me and then

1026.329 --> 1031.1299999999999
yeah you do get those looks because you

1028.79 --> 1033.29
radiate that they that radiates off you

1031.13 --> 1034.97
and the people see that and they feel

1033.29 --> 1038.0
like there's something wrong with this

1034.97 --> 1040.73
guy I shouldn't mess with that or stay

1038.0 --> 1042.29
away you don't associate and I don't

1040.73 --> 1045.25
have that anymore I don't have that

1042.29 --> 1050.06
radiance anymore and now the world is

1045.25 --> 1054.7
just opening up in some ways and that is

1050.06 --> 1059.84
an amazing amazing experience and also

1054.7 --> 1062.78
you get to see other people opening up

1059.84 --> 1065.84
to you on levels that have obvious had

1062.78 --> 1069.67
Lee had their own through out their own

1065.84 --> 1072.55
experiences that I underestimate I

1069.67 --> 1076.1000000000001
underestimated them from a distance and

1072.55 --> 1078.98
I still do it sometimes that people a

1076.1 --> 1081.4099999999999
lot of people seem simple but if they

1078.98 --> 1085.28
open up to you then you will certainly

1081.41 --> 1088.91
start to feel certain frequencies and I

1085.28 --> 1091.49
can sense from those the intensity on

1088.91 --> 1093.98
the frequencies that they radiate when

1091.49 --> 1096.14
they open up what they've really been

1093.98 --> 1098.45
dealing with all their life what's

1096.14 --> 1100.94
really at their core what their main

1098.45 --> 1104.8700000000001
struggle is what level of energy that

1100.94 --> 1107.64
struggle is and how complex that will

1104.87 --> 1111.62
reveal them in itself to me

1107.64 --> 1115.5
and it just like oh man I underestimated

1111.62 --> 1117.87
again another person at as to their

1115.5 --> 1122.97
capability then they might not even know

1117.87 --> 1128.6999999999998
this themselves very consciously but

1122.97 --> 1133.8600000000001
they do have depth and they do have some

1128.7 --> 1137.13
complexity at least that they focus on a

1133.86 --> 1139.1399999999999
specific region or they just kind of

1137.13 --> 1140.97
don't show it too much because I had

1139.14 --> 1144.0600000000002
trouble with it a lot of people that are

1140.97 --> 1145.29
extremely smart when they just gush it

1144.06 --> 1148.08
out in public

1145.29 --> 1150.57
other people get offended by that

1148.08 --> 1152.79
sometimes it's like what are you trying

1150.57 --> 1154.83
to brag or something or they don't

1152.79 --> 1157.44
understand it and so they just declare

1154.83 --> 1160.97
you like you're nuts and we'd get that a

1157.44 --> 1163.8200000000002
lot though this is more polarized

1160.97 --> 1166.77
scenario with the ballers and everything

1163.82 --> 1171.33
but yeah a lot of people because of this

1166.77 --> 1173.7
effect will just not apply their

1171.33 --> 1175.47
intelligence in social situations they

1173.7 --> 1179.16
won't demonstrate it they don't have

1175.47 --> 1182.8500000000001
that radical they can stop it and just

1179.16 --> 1188.3700000000001
save it I have a lot of trouble doing

1182.85 --> 1191.33
that I just I guess almost like a it's

1188.37 --> 1194.6999999999998
an artistic tic I guess to want to

1191.33 --> 1197.55
express it constantly and try to fight

1194.7 --> 1202.32
find somebody just find this entrance

1197.55 --> 1205.11
like hey is there some room for intense

1202.32 --> 1207.4199999999998
complex information with this person do

1205.11 --> 1212.1
they have some room for growth and just

1207.42 --> 1215.22
to feel it out carefully before I pile

1212.1 --> 1219.03
it all on and usually I just can't pile

1215.22 --> 1221.79
on oh just a couple of things then just

1219.03 --> 1226.68
see how they deal with that but I want

1221.79 --> 1230.61
to just like oh here's my library giant

1226.68 --> 1234.99
pile of books that's me and fortunately

1230.61 --> 1236.9799999999998
I just have so much to share and and I

1234.99 --> 1242.02
have trouble holding that back

1236.98 --> 1244.89
it's very impulsive with with conveying

1242.02 --> 1248.08
information sharing information

1244.89 --> 1255.6100000000001
intellectual interaction I love that I'm

1248.08 --> 1262.4499999999998
addicted to it pretty much so hey Jose

1255.61 --> 1270.3999999999999
is in chat good to see you and rambling

1262.45 --> 1276.64
on complex things social interactions

1270.4 --> 1278.799
and Christ and a funny thing is again in

1276.64 --> 1285.19
the past this already has been revealed

1278.799 --> 1288.49
to me and back then used it to basically

1285.19 --> 1291.6100000000001
renounce Christ oh look oh they're all

1288.49 --> 1294.07
lies no that's so evil yeah if you're an

1291.61 --> 1295.4189999999999
atheist very easy to do that like oh

1294.07 --> 1297.6399999999999
there's something wrong oh it's all lies

1295.419 --> 1302.1100000000001
so just step away it's all lies it's all

1297.64 --> 1305.26
fake but yeah about Christ because

1302.11 --> 1309.58
there's like alternative stories out

1305.26 --> 1312.61
there that have even some historical

1309.58 --> 1316.24
validity like I think it was said that

1312.61 --> 1321.76
christ jesus nazareth didn't actually

1316.24 --> 1323.86
die yeah sorry it's I don't know if it's

1321.76 --> 1326.3799999999999
true or not but that he didn't die and

1323.86 --> 1329.9799999999998
my mother told me this even by the way

1326.38 --> 1335.97
and that he moved to India and that

1329.98 --> 1341.5
there's like still even a temple in his

1335.97 --> 1344.2
Indian name I guess because he took on

1341.5 --> 1347.77
another name I think yeah I guess he was

1344.2 --> 1351.22
fleeing you could call it or just moving

1347.77 --> 1353.559
because yeah he was gonna die anyway I

1351.22 --> 1355.1200000000001
don't know sorry sorry about this is

1353.559 --> 1357.37
kind of stupid bringing this forward and

1355.12 --> 1360.309
not knowing enough details to really set

1357.37 --> 1366.27
down a proper story but think said that

1360.309 --> 1370.299
he moved to India and that he had like a

1366.27 --> 1371.09
Christian temple thing there or

1370.299 --> 1373.85
something

1371.09 --> 1376.07
and he just died of old age or he

1373.85 --> 1384.86
disappeared or something I don't even

1376.07 --> 1387.86
know so that's very roughly what I

1384.86 --> 1388.34
remember I was being told like 20 years

1387.86 --> 1394.82
ago

1388.34 --> 1398.4499999999998
by my mother on the other hand yeah

1394.82 --> 1405.4099999999999
having basically forgotten a lot of this

1398.45 --> 1408.0800000000002
one disregarded it not really yeah there

1405.41 --> 1410.3600000000001
was a look every time you switch or you

1408.08 --> 1413.4499999999998
realize something new what tends to

1410.36 --> 1416.1799999999998
happen is you get startled by old things

1413.45 --> 1420.53
that were told and then even think like

1416.18 --> 1423.49
oh gosh my mother my enemy really you

1420.53 --> 1427.67
get to think all these crazy things and

1423.49 --> 1432.05
that if you have these type of thing and

1427.67 --> 1435.23
thoughts then once you fear somebody

1432.05 --> 1438.23
close to you then you start to basically

1435.23 --> 1440.24
it numbs out that the detail of the

1438.23 --> 1441.98
meaning of every interaction from there

1440.24 --> 1444.5
on you've had because there's this doubt

1441.98 --> 1447.65
like and I really trust it and that

1444.5 --> 1451.31
blurs up things in your mind even more

1447.65 --> 1452.93
so now that a lot of this mist of things

1451.31 --> 1455.1799999999998
that has happened in my past has been

1452.93 --> 1457.6100000000001
clear enough things are coming back to

1455.18 --> 1460.97
me and I remember this like yeah my

1457.61 --> 1467.05
mother did tell me this like 20 years

1460.97 --> 1469.46
ago and didn't have much content

1467.05 --> 1473.48
reflected on but I thought it was really

1469.46 --> 1476.42
interesting and scary that if that was

1473.48 --> 1479.42
true that the church was basically had

1476.42 --> 1484.8200000000002
fabricated the story a martyr type story

1479.42 --> 1492.38
and surrounded much the core religion on

1484.82 --> 1494.45
it in a very creepy way and yeah but I I

1492.38 --> 1495.0500000000002
don't want to approach it like that

1494.45 --> 1499.97
anymore

1495.05 --> 1502.04
I just wanna you know if people want to

1499.97 --> 1504.26
believe that that is what happened with

1502.04 --> 1505.309
Christ at the cross and everything fine

1504.26 --> 1508.34
it is

1505.309 --> 1510.95
a remarkable concept of personal

1508.34 --> 1514.97
sacrifice for the greater good and that

1510.95 --> 1516.679
is something even if it literally didn't

1514.97 --> 1522.259
happen something that does kind of

1516.679 --> 1525.8890000000001
inspire awe to me the story as it is

1522.259 --> 1527.749
told so I don't see necessarily anything

1525.889 --> 1529.9989999999998
wrong with it although I don't like the

1527.749 --> 1534.32
Emperor I never did like to emphasize

1529.999 --> 1537.529
the dying of Christ I always just felt

1534.32 --> 1539.629
like uncomfortable like not some moment

1537.529 --> 1542.059
like oh he's dying oh I should be

1539.629 --> 1543.4089999999999
feeling holy of this amazing no it's

1542.059 --> 1547.759
still disgusting

1543.409 --> 1549.7990000000002
I hope he's feeling that guy that's

1547.759 --> 1551.809
really good on that cross basically

1549.799 --> 1554.99
being tortured to death in a very brutal

1551.809 --> 1560.149
fashion it's just disgusting I can never

1554.99 --> 1563.259
feel holy in the presence of being aware

1560.149 --> 1567.7399999999998
of that as a concept I never had that

1563.259 --> 1569.659
but I did respect it as portrayed like

1567.74 --> 1571.46
wow yeah if he really knew that was

1569.659 --> 1579.3690000000001
gonna happen and he would do it anyway

1571.46 --> 1583.669
that's such a responsibility just beyond

1579.369 --> 1586.6999999999998
like I didn't that humbles me somebody

1583.669 --> 1589.6390000000001
would do that in such a fashion but yeah

1586.7 --> 1592.8500000000001
then there's the other historical

1589.639 --> 1597.4289999999999
interpretations that he just moved away

1592.85 --> 1604.2489999999998
and that the story was later made up but

1597.429 --> 1606.94
yeah so in my Cornerstone form of

1604.249 --> 1609.8600000000001
Christianity and the fundaments I just

1606.94 --> 1612.049
it doesn't really matter to me in the

1609.86 --> 1614.389
end whether he died or lived and moved

1612.049 --> 1617.299
to India doesn't matter to me because it

1614.389 --> 1621.4399999999998
matters what he did and what he tried to

1617.299 --> 1624.71
convey and the amazing wisdom that still

1621.44 --> 1630.049
shines through on paper to this day he

1624.71 --> 1634.7
can't he can't erase the frequency of

1630.049 --> 1638.86
the energy of his words and what he was

1634.7 --> 1642.04
in that moment so

1638.86 --> 1644.2299999999998
in the moments that he was around that

1642.04 --> 1647.02
was written where there was things

1644.23 --> 1649.72
written about him can't ignore that the

1647.02 --> 1654.33
energy of it so that's my interpretation

1649.72 --> 1658.3700000000001
that's where I'm gonna hold on to it and

1654.33 --> 1661.49
yeah what whatever happens

1658.37 --> 1661.4899999999998
[Music]

1661.92 --> 1669.9
like you think Christianity could change

1667.27 --> 1673.74
this would days change the story

1669.9 --> 1676.15
or will it cause some kind of Christian

1673.74 --> 1678.88
revolution in a revolution again we're

1676.15 --> 1680.5900000000001
just like okay some parts like maybe if

1678.88 --> 1682.3600000000001
the Catholic Church will just say okay

1680.59 --> 1687.1299999999999
you didn't actually die across well

1682.36 --> 1691.6899999999998
wouldn't that cause similar event like

1687.13 --> 1693.6100000000001
the Calvinist revolution like where

1691.69 --> 1695.29
there's just giant swap maybe the

1693.61 --> 1697.7199999999998
Baptist or something or just gonna make

1695.29 --> 1699.52
okay this is enough you can't say that

1697.72 --> 1702.97
Christ didn't hang it across and we're

1699.52 --> 1707.1299999999999
now separating and no longer cook maybe

1702.97 --> 1711.33
that will happen something like that

1707.13 --> 1714.46
makes me really nervous because

1711.33 --> 1720.03
Christianity should be a religion about

1714.46 --> 1722.8600000000001
peace and not about dictating specifics

1720.03 --> 1726.549
then you would get the same kind of

1722.86 --> 1730.1499999999999
issues as what happened with Islam the

1726.549 --> 1733.059
Shiites and [ __ ] in the Sunnis this

1730.15 --> 1736.3300000000002
another one like yeah the one says okay

1733.059 --> 1739.059
it is you have to be a priest you have

1736.33 --> 1742.48
to be of Muhammad's family bloodline and

1739.059 --> 1743.83
the other says no it didn't that's it

1742.48 --> 1746.73
that's a difference and there's a

1743.83 --> 1752.3799999999999
freaking war going on forever about it

1746.73 --> 1755.16
so yeah we did it I don't know what to

1752.38 --> 1755.16
do with this really

1756.37 --> 1765.4289999999999
so yeah I'm still here alone you know

1762.94 --> 1767.23
it's nice to see you all talking in chat

1765.429 --> 1769.96
but if anyone wants to join you can

1767.23 --> 1778.809
still do so still half and half an hour

1769.96 --> 1786.279
left in the show you can't keep rambling

1778.809 --> 1787.539
on about this wherever anyway however

1786.279 --> 1794.399
you want to see it

1787.539 --> 1794.399
praise Christ and his shining example

1796.23 --> 1804.909
angel Michael watch over all you try to

1802.029 --> 1817.059
do the right thing and dedicate

1804.909 --> 1819.3990000000001
themselves to the path so I've been well

1817.059 --> 1821.08
we all got to know a lot of new

1819.399 --> 1826.9189999999999
interesting people in the last few

1821.08 --> 1832.029
months so many stalkers and thinkers

1826.919 --> 1834.159
have joined the ranks not not even that

1832.029 --> 1836.5
I've spoken the Flat Earth necessarily

1834.159 --> 1839.8300000000002
it's just a lot of new people that are

1836.5 --> 1843.429
now in between us in between the

1839.83 --> 1847.87
original debaters and man meeting people

1843.429 --> 1851.77
every day yesterday I I popped into just

1847.87 --> 1854.4089999999999
this random hangout of guys that I think

1851.77 --> 1856.929
were flat earthers I'd never seen them

1854.409 --> 1862.2890000000002
before but they were talking about how

1856.929 --> 1862.289
NASA was fake in space was fake so and

1862.95 --> 1871.3600000000001
also talking a bit about one guy that he

1866.32 --> 1873.25
was actually a Muslim it was interesting

1871.36 --> 1880.4799999999998
it was interesting to watch I did some

1873.25 --> 1883.6
commenting in chat that's it yeah so

1880.48 --> 1889.03
many people are just how they're doing

1883.6 --> 1889.81
things and no I will take a more wild

1889.03 --> 1891.61
look around

1889.81 --> 1893.86
in there see what's going on and maybe I

1891.61 --> 1898.1399999999999
do I like this - I like the way to think

1893.86 --> 1898.1399999999999
they would like the energy and then

1898.29 --> 1906.07
maybe reach out I find people that I

1903.01 --> 1909.64
just really like see if I can get them

1906.07 --> 1913.0
over in our corner yeah that would be

1909.64 --> 1915.46
cool so many people now are just they

1913.0 --> 1918.16
just seem to spring up out of nowhere it

1915.46 --> 1920.38
is almost sometimes to me it feels like

1918.16 --> 1922.5400000000002
the Mandela effect but yeah we're doing

1920.38 --> 1926.14
this now we're we're doing this for such

1922.54 --> 1928.27
a long time and then like oh what's here

1926.14 --> 1930.8500000000001
they're there these people have also

1928.27 --> 1933.04
been doing this thing for like years

1930.85 --> 1935.1699999999998
and we've never seen them it it really

1933.04 --> 1938.8899999999999
almost does feel like a Mandela effect

1935.17 --> 1942.01
like oh they were always there why how

1938.89 --> 1944.65
could we have missed this now of course

1942.01 --> 1946.81
we know that it is usually has to do

1944.65 --> 1950.2800000000002
with the algorithm keeping us apart but

1946.81 --> 1952.54
it is just so bizarre to experience this

1950.28 --> 1955.69
bumping into people that have been added

1952.54 --> 1960.25
for years about these subjects

1955.69 --> 1962.79
completely separate Road it's so funny

1960.25 --> 1962.79
how that works

1970.25 --> 1981.83
right okay travel about yeah

1974.78 --> 1984.98
now that doesn't work you can't oh well

1981.83 --> 1987.1699999999998
I get you know it all depends on what

1984.98 --> 1990.83
you call pedo you know if you actually

1987.17 --> 1991.7
act upon it upon the impulse yeah you're

1990.83 --> 1996.23
not a Christian

1991.7 --> 1999.8
it's just absolutely prohibited and yeah

1996.23 --> 2000.93
maybe some freaky Catholic priests do

1999.8 --> 2003.43
this [ __ ]

2000.93 --> 2007.66
that kind of also makes them not

2003.43 --> 2009.19
Christian and look there's a lot of

2007.66 --> 2011.68
things that Catholic Church has been

2009.19 --> 2015.19
doing of dears that are extremely

2011.68 --> 2023.8300000000002
unchristian in so many ways so blatantly

2015.19 --> 2026.41
so to say look this group they're like

2023.83 --> 2031.3
oh they are D Christians and they are

2026.41 --> 2033.8700000000001
obviously like Devils then that's super

2031.3 --> 2039.22
overgeneralizing no this group is just

2033.87 --> 2043.4199999999998
corrupted and they are not the other

2039.22 --> 2046.21
Christian groups I don't think there

2043.42 --> 2047.89
really are that many pedophiles

2046.21 --> 2050.62
out there I think that's really mostly

2047.89 --> 2052.69
that's just like a sub gang in the

2050.62 --> 2054.79
Catholic Church and that they've been

2052.69 --> 2059.649
recruiting for that specific I don't

2054.79 --> 2061.62
think other other Christian groups and

2059.649 --> 2067.81
religions do that at all

2061.62 --> 2073.7999999999997
really I don't and I hope that I'm

2067.81 --> 2077.56
corrected that I don't know why they

2073.8 --> 2080.0800000000004
wait so many people do that kind of [ __ ]

2077.56 --> 2082.33
oh well many pit it's actually quite

2080.08 --> 2084.129
rare but still like yeah in this world

2082.33 --> 2088.84
with so many people that turns out to be

2084.129 --> 2096.429
a whole lot of people unfortunately it's

2088.84 --> 2101.5
disgusting but ya know Christianity does

2096.429 --> 2102.7400000000002
not allow this pretty sure I don't think

2101.5 --> 2104.86
that Christ approved

2102.74 --> 2104.8599999999997
it

2113.859 --> 2118.499
right yeah got a switch button chat says

2116.319 --> 2125.64
I thought Catholics warned Christians

2118.499 --> 2129.1189999999997
well yeah the Catholic Institute is

2125.64 --> 2131.65
corrupted even a long time ago it's

2129.119 --> 2133.7490000000003
according to the Christian principles it

2131.65 --> 2135.039
shouldn't be there shouldn't even be a

2133.749 --> 2140.3489999999997
church really

2135.039 --> 2142.6600000000003
so doesn't mean that anyone who would go

2140.349 --> 2147.7200000000003
to a Catholic Church would automatically

2142.66 --> 2151.8089999999997
make them into a devil worshiper

2147.72 --> 2154.509
absolutely not like the flock can still

2151.809 --> 2156.789
be very pure and that purity will

2154.509 --> 2160.989
protect them even if the den that they

2156.789 --> 2163.029
go to is corrupted unless they let

2160.989 --> 2165.789
themselves get dragged into that [ __ ]

2163.029 --> 2166.42
and become part of it that's another

2165.789 --> 2172.329
matter

2166.42 --> 2174.819
so yeah no I don't think everyone that's

2172.329 --> 2177.329
associated with that church or that goes

2174.819 --> 2181.269
to Catholic churches automatically is

2177.329 --> 2183.2200000000003
evil or corrupted or it all depends on

2181.269 --> 2187.4799999999996
the individual always does it always

2183.22 --> 2189.97
really does actual Christianity it

2187.48 --> 2192.64
really comes down to the individual soul

2189.97 --> 2194.89
the individual spirit who makes the

2192.64 --> 2201.39
decision you know whatever path they

2194.89 --> 2206.44
take or if they're gonna stray hey Jose

2201.39 --> 2209.069
good morning just want to present you my

2206.44 --> 2209.069
new betrothed

2210.819 --> 2217.15
you see the gift I'm not sure it's no

2214.69 --> 2222.039
study oh damn it

2217.15 --> 2224.14
thing I got to reset it it's no worded I

2222.039 --> 2226.9300000000003
thought it was the gift like changing

2224.14 --> 2231.609
train track punch a train adventure

2226.93 --> 2240.19
train ask ask Riley how to do it he has

2231.609 --> 2242.17
if yeah I don't want to see that as my

2240.19 --> 2244.859
yeah but there I mean let me hang up and

2242.17 --> 2244.859
I'll be back in a minute

2245.08 --> 2251.12
so you just woke up or you've been

2247.55 --> 2253.04
listening to me ramble I know I've been

2251.12 --> 2255.47
listening for the last like 15 minutes I

2253.04 --> 2257.56
got off work and I just plugging I was

2255.47 --> 2267.29
eating something before I even jump in

2257.56 --> 2269.36
so any feedback yes no not really I mean

2267.29 --> 2270.98
I was listening I said I got no much to

2269.36 --> 2273.4700000000003
say but I still gonna jump in to hang

2270.98 --> 2274.73
out with you freely a bit just a

2273.47 --> 2276.5299999999997
comments keep coming

2274.73 --> 2278.87
contrôlée comments like how can you

2276.53 --> 2281.9
prove the training train tracks are flat

2278.87 --> 2283.49
and oh you you're a global now you prove

2281.9 --> 2288.85
soundless curve or whatever that's like

2283.49 --> 2288.85
are you guys talking about like you know

2289.54 --> 2296.63
roof roof was very active I posted the

2294.2 --> 2300.0499999999997
picture the side-by-side comparison on

2296.63 --> 2303.7400000000002
Google+ I just created a Google+ pretty

2300.05 --> 2306.05
much now I didn't have one and I added I

2303.74 --> 2308.6499999999996
he gave me a list of people that I might

2306.05 --> 2312.3500000000004
know and I added it and I wrote if I

2308.65 --> 2314.2400000000002
commented if I like so what is this and

2312.35 --> 2317.5699999999997
I was kind of back up forward in a chat

2314.24 --> 2320.54
with him okay I being like all right

2317.57 --> 2322.52
whatever you say you know so yeah indeed

2320.54 --> 2323.0299999999997
I was able to replicate it and that's it

2322.52 --> 2325.07
period

2323.03 --> 2327.1400000000003
I'm not trying to prove anything if it's

2325.07 --> 2328.9700000000003
flat if it's curved nothing the only

2327.14 --> 2333.02
thing I'm proving is I was able to

2328.97 --> 2336.83
replicate it by the tea you know yeah it

2333.02 --> 2340.13
was really good it's astounding how well

2336.83 --> 2344.93
it fits it's a distinct pattern

2340.13 --> 2347.0
apparently and so amazing that despite

2344.93 --> 2350.18
it not being the same skill it's showing

2347.0 --> 2353.2
the exact same pattern which for us is a

2350.18 --> 2355.79
clear-cut evidence that it is

2353.2 --> 2358.54
diffraction and yeah that what we've

2355.79 --> 2361.43
been saying that they're fractions like

2358.54 --> 2363.29
distance versus observer height there's

2361.43 --> 2367.04
a linear relation in how it will

2363.29 --> 2372.67
manifest and your picture just proves

2367.04 --> 2375.82
that in a smaller scale the camera lower

2372.67 --> 2378.6800000000003
smaller distance the same effect higher

2375.82 --> 2381.26
observation [ __ ] long distance

2378.68 --> 2383.6
the same effect I mean is I mean yeah

2381.26 --> 2386.42
it's an optical effect that has to be

2383.6 --> 2390.2599999999998
like explore more people should explore

2386.42 --> 2397.2200000000003
a more time in period if it explore

2390.26 --> 2401.5400000000004
study that I I think that there should

2397.22 --> 2403.52
be like say for example even in 3d games

2401.54 --> 2407.21
I don't think they did apply this stuff

2403.52 --> 2409.91
they should apply this stuff like have

2407.21 --> 2412.52
this diffraction effects present and I

2409.91 --> 2416.45
think it could be model out I don't

2412.52 --> 2418.73
think it's that hard right let's do once

2416.45 --> 2421.0
you figure out how the patterns work you

2418.73 --> 2426.65
could just apply it like another filter

2421.0 --> 2428.15
over the algorithm of the 3d engine yeah

2426.65 --> 2432.17
I'm trying to find me as I walk around

2428.15 --> 2435.35
like long maybe fences or something

2432.17 --> 2438.14
higher you know like I label something

2435.35 --> 2440.66
that is not like it just a flat floor or

2438.14 --> 2442.97
a flat little plain supermarket or

2440.66 --> 2445.64
whatever we're trying to find a fence or

2442.97 --> 2448.8199999999997
something like I can perceive is 100%

2445.64 --> 2450.74
straight and I I mean I'm pretty sure

2448.82 --> 2452.9
that I'm gonna if I shoot the camera

2450.74 --> 2454.6699999999996
along it I should be able to catch the

2452.9 --> 2457.4900000000002
same curvy effect at the end at least

2454.67 --> 2460.51
you know it's not curvature under a mile

2457.49 --> 2463.31
I mean on a freakin a hundred feet

2460.51 --> 2466.0400000000004
friends it's not gonna be a curve but

2463.31 --> 2468.08
then keep repeating this and getting the

2466.04 --> 2470.57
same effect then it will give it away

2468.08 --> 2478.39
that if it's no curve I mean definitely

2470.57 --> 2481.1600000000003
it's not absolutely so yeah and even

2478.39 --> 2486.71
even if it was curve it's being cut off

2481.16 --> 2491.5099999999998
right there so like does it's the curve

2486.71 --> 2493.1
like goes like this yeah are you just

2491.51 --> 2498.34
continue going down like what is the

2493.1 --> 2498.3399999999997
older what is further part it's like

2499.27 --> 2503.3
it's not the top of the roller coaster

2501.95 --> 2504.5
well you see that I fed you you're going

2503.3 --> 2506.0
up the roller coaster and you see

2504.5 --> 2508.64
curving and that's it it disappears

2506.0 --> 2511.34
that's this right here I mean really I

2508.64 --> 2512.359
mean wittily I mean there's not a hill

2511.34 --> 2514.549
like

2512.359 --> 2516.98
continiously deep in downhill in there

2514.549 --> 2519.71
so what is the rest of the track it just

2516.98 --> 2523.42
cut off it just disappears the optical

2519.71 --> 2523.42
effect you know crazy stuff

2543.19 --> 2553.79
hmm sorry sorry for a long silence I'm

2549.89 --> 2555.5
just so good we like sorry too sometimes

2553.79 --> 2557.42
you know it's just like you know they'll

2555.5 --> 2559.37
give that give a little bit of air to

2557.42 --> 2560.69
the shot or whatever it's like whoa what

2559.37 --> 2562.94
and they maybe they throw a little

2560.69 --> 2565.4900000000002
something and it's Monday curiosity in

2562.94 --> 2573.56
oh yeah people do need some recovery I'm

2565.49 --> 2575.72
afraid ramble on for half an hour little

2573.56 --> 2576.67
words today I got off work early today I

2575.72 --> 2580.1299999999997
like nice

2576.67 --> 2582.59
now tonight going in I started at

2580.13 --> 2585.38
midnight tonight is the beginning of the

2582.59 --> 2588.92
week so if we go Sun like Saturday night

2585.38 --> 2590.6
if we go before midnight they don't want

2588.92 --> 2593.1800000000003
the overtime that I want to included in

2590.6 --> 2596.81
the paycheck they live they which closes

2593.18 --> 2601.16
at midnight on Saturday you know so I

2596.81 --> 2603.7999999999997
mean like at 11:59 so their scheduler

2601.16 --> 2606.19
like Sunday I mean somebody midnight uh

2603.8 --> 2606.19
sucks

2606.97 --> 2622.3599999999997
night shifts yeah until 9:00 in the

2612.26 --> 2622.36
morning yeah long I can do it you can

2622.6 --> 2629.2599999999998
yeah I did it for maybe four years

2625.7 --> 2632.81
straight I did the overnight shift I did

2629.26 --> 2634.9700000000003
four days 12 hours to have our that

2632.81 --> 2639.37
night shift 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 in the

2634.97 --> 2642.3799999999997
morning for four years man I was crazy

2639.37 --> 2644.06
yeah four on three of four on three off

2642.38 --> 2645.62
it was good because at least I had three

2644.06 --> 2647.87
days off back to back to back it was

2645.62 --> 2650.12
like mini vacations every week but those

2647.87 --> 2652.43
long days like the second day I was

2650.12 --> 2654.74
already like for drying up you know beat

2652.43 --> 2656.8399999999997
up that made me lose a lot of weight a

2654.74 --> 2659.39
lot of sleep you know I got freakin the

2656.84 --> 2661.6400000000003
the dark under my eyes in the first year

2659.39 --> 2664.52
or so and then I figured out a schedule

2661.64 --> 2666.7999999999997
to eat and sleep you know set up set

2664.52 --> 2669.21
schedule on those night times it was

2666.8 --> 2672.15
still hard for me then I went back today

2669.21 --> 2672.78
for a few years and Here I am overnight

2672.15 --> 2677.04
shift

2672.78 --> 2680.9300000000003
graveyard shift they call it again are

2677.04 --> 2684.69
you sure do you get enough vitamin D

2680.93 --> 2688.74
because the night shifting then you're

2684.69 --> 2690.75
gonna miss some light in the day I don't

2688.74 --> 2692.6699999999996
get pretty much any vitamins that all

2690.75 --> 2695.31
I'm gonna have to start doing something

2692.67 --> 2697.77
getting some kind of supplement for

2695.31 --> 2700.56
vitamins because I eat very crappy food

2697.77 --> 2703.44
I don't drink water I drink a lot of

2700.56 --> 2708.74
sodas and energy drink oh [ __ ] dude yeah

2703.44 --> 2711.18
he's bad oh man why he why do you do it

2708.74 --> 2713.58
killing myself and I haven't been in a

2711.18 --> 2716.0699999999997
doctor I haven't been really sick since

2713.58 --> 2718.71
I mean when I was 18 years old I broke

2716.07 --> 2720.1800000000003
my wrist my right wrist and that was the

2718.71 --> 2722.7
last time I've been in a doctor I had

2720.18 --> 2726.4199999999996
surgery I got a fixed up so he's being

2722.7 --> 2728.2799999999997
over over 20 years almost 25 years that

2726.42 --> 2729.9300000000003
I haven't been in a hospital at all so I

2728.28 --> 2733.9500000000003
don't know if I got any type of

2729.93 --> 2743.46
conditions anything but still pushing

2733.95 --> 2745.98
through a man yeah I hope that lasts

2743.46 --> 2749.19
maybe you just got the metabolism and

2745.98 --> 2752.07
Eirene metabolism or something but man

2749.19 --> 2755.57
I'm really glad that I don't drink soft

2752.07 --> 2755.57
drinks anymore ever ever

2755.84 --> 2762.9900000000002
that's good look at your msg off

2758.79 --> 2765.12
anything non-gmo it's become like a I

2762.99 --> 2769.1699999999996
sometimes really feels like I'm like a

2765.12 --> 2771.75
monk or something because like I'll like

2769.17 --> 2773.76
be dropping off newspapers or whatever

2771.75 --> 2776.42
and like a group of old folks are just

2773.76 --> 2780.3
eating like the most delicious-looking

2776.42 --> 2782.9700000000003
ice-cream with whipped cream and like

2780.3 --> 2785.9
krispies is like what and they're just

2782.97 --> 2789.48
after yeah you want some is it organic

2785.9 --> 2794.67
no of course not well then I wanna take

2789.48 --> 2797.9900000000002
it nope even though I really want to

2794.67 --> 2800.25
actually but I'm just not gonna do it

2797.99 --> 2802.8599999999997
that's good that's a good thing yeah you

2800.25 --> 2806.76
keeping your body healthy

2802.86 --> 2811.11
it's a weekly thing I'm used to it also

2806.76 --> 2816.57
when I in the earlier times when I would

2811.11 --> 2818.04
be going out with ya friends then it's

2816.57 --> 2820.5
rare that there would be anything

2818.04 --> 2823.4
organic in the places we will be going

2820.5 --> 2826.08
out and I would just not get anything

2823.4 --> 2828.33
just stick to my bottle of water but

2826.08 --> 2831.12
this is incredible that's what I was

2828.33 --> 2833.43
going incredible sometimes there's one

2831.12 --> 2835.35
two three weeks maybe a month that I

2833.43 --> 2837.69
don't have even a sip of water

2835.35 --> 2840.96
I don't put water in my body bro I don't

2837.69 --> 2842.9900000000002
drink water sodas energy drinks maybe a

2840.96 --> 2845.58
Gatorade every once in a while

2842.99 --> 2848.1899999999996
juiced like an orange juice or something

2845.58 --> 2861.7799999999997
but not a fan it's just sodas and

2848.19 --> 2864.03
freakin sugary drinks yeah hopefully

2861.78 --> 2866.7900000000004
they don't hit me hard one day because

2864.03 --> 2869.52
yeah I know it's very unhealthy I'm 43

2866.79 --> 2872.55
years old man when I got it start taking

2869.52 --> 2874.86
care of my heart so yeah one day I will

2872.55 --> 2876.51
look into myself and I said like what

2874.86 --> 2879.15
the hell am i doing not drinking water

2876.51 --> 2881.25
eating all crappy food smoking bad right

2879.15 --> 2884.61
she put yours you know if you start to

2881.25 --> 2888.75
get some symptoms out of nowhere come to

2884.61 --> 2890.58
me and I'll help you yeah it just I mean

2888.75 --> 2893.07
a little difficult because I don't have

2890.58 --> 2895.47
I mean I know it's no gonna take a lot

2893.07 --> 2897.2400000000002
of money to keep a good diet because at

2895.47 --> 2899.22
least with with drinking a lot of water

2897.24 --> 2902.04
to start that's a good a good beginning

2899.22 --> 2904.1699999999996
for me not necessarily look it may be

2902.04 --> 2905.91
intuitive it all depends on the water

2904.17 --> 2908.58
quality of your region maybe you're not

2905.91 --> 2910.5
drinking water because your intuition

2908.58 --> 2912.65
has already been telling you like yeah

2910.5 --> 2915.45
that water is not for drinking really

2912.65 --> 2921.3
even though it has to be that could be

2915.45 --> 2923.49
like in for example Spain in the 90s the

2921.3 --> 2925.4700000000003
water quality was totally crappy nobody

2923.49 --> 2927.6899999999996
would drink that some people would

2925.47 --> 2929.6099999999997
actually drink it and they wouldn't be

2927.69 --> 2932.1
all that bright because there was a

2929.61 --> 2934.86
chlorine in it and all that but some

2932.1 --> 2937.13
people just don't drink water they just

2934.86 --> 2941.67
only drank wine or something

2937.13 --> 2943.71
yeah yeah I realize when I drink a lot

2941.67 --> 2946.35
of water he messes my stomach up here

2943.71 --> 2948.18
when I drink water for real one or two

2946.35 --> 2950.73
bottles of water in one day he just

2948.18 --> 2952.83
softened my stomach up you just send me

2950.73 --> 2959.4
to the bathroom because my body is just

2952.83 --> 2961.08
now yes the drinks isn't much water good

2959.4 --> 2962.85
water I mean bottled water like the

2961.08 --> 2964.83
expensive running the little coolest in

2962.85 --> 2967.08
the gas stations even though it's

2964.83 --> 2969.48
bottled water but their crap anyway they

2967.08 --> 2972.2
are literally you know that like a

2969.48 --> 2974.94
typical mineral water that's bottled

2972.2 --> 2977.25
well first of all usually they tend to

2974.94 --> 2978.7200000000003
be bottled in plastic bottles and how

2977.25 --> 2981.17
long has that been standing there hasn't

2978.72 --> 2985.0499999999997
been standing in the Sun it's gonna have

2981.17 --> 2988.04
it's gonna have bisphenol A in it

2985.05 --> 2990.3300000000004
the estrogen mimicking plastic leech

2988.04 --> 2992.4
that's gonna have influence oh yeah

2990.33 --> 2995.31
that's not something you want turns you

2992.4 --> 2999.4500000000003
into soy boy over period if you take

2995.31 --> 3001.7599999999998
that a lot and there's also the typical

2999.45 --> 3004.7
mineral water even if the it is bottled

3001.76 --> 3008.6000000000004
it has I don't know that the English

3004.7 --> 3013.52
word for it but it has like Dec dead

3008.6 --> 3016.25
bacterial remnants in it serious that's

3013.52 --> 3020.0
just it it's even like percentage-wise

3016.25 --> 3022.73
noted how much there is in there it is

3020.0 --> 3024.83
almost unfit it's kind of sterile but

3022.73 --> 3027.56
there's still this bacteria crap in

3024.83 --> 3029.5099999999998
there that's really present in these

3027.56 --> 3031.43
wells that they tap it from but you

3029.51 --> 3036.61
should filter that out it's not good I

3031.43 --> 3039.3799999999997
only drink water from my own ceramic

3036.61 --> 3042.5
gravity-fed as they call it water for

3039.38 --> 3044.63
the top station and that is ceramic

3042.5 --> 3047.6
filter and it filters everything out all

3044.63 --> 3052.31
this bacterial remnant crap all the

3047.6 --> 3054.02
heavy metals fluoride all that anything

3052.31 --> 3058.16
that's in it that's not supposed to be

3054.02 --> 3060.56
in it is out but it does retain the

3058.16 --> 3064.67
normal minerals that are dissolved in

3060.56 --> 3067.0099999999998
the water so yeah and that's why it

3064.67 --> 3069.16
feels every time I take a glass of this

3067.01 --> 3072.059
it feels literally like

3069.16 --> 3076.8289999999997
I'm just taking my glass under like this

3072.059 --> 3079.539
jungle fresh spring water it's amazing

3076.829 --> 3081.9100000000003
yeah I think a while ago I seen somebody

3079.539 --> 3085.509
it might have been Jaron that was

3081.91 --> 3088.0589999999997
talking about some kind of how do you

3085.509 --> 3089.829
call it I live or Tess effect he put

3088.059 --> 3091.9900000000002
some a little apparatus in top of the

3089.829 --> 3094.1800000000003
border like he passes through another

3091.99 --> 3096.91
one I did a little Baltics and that

3094.18 --> 3100.6299999999997
energy don't thing with the water yeah I

3096.91 --> 3103.569
do that too I even have a device I call

3100.63 --> 3108.4300000000003
app energizer I bought it 10 years ago

3103.569 --> 3110.859
and it it does something to the water it

3108.43 --> 3113.5589999999997
like kind of ionized it it's changes

3110.859 --> 3116.38
even visibly the way the surface tension

3113.559 --> 3118.2690000000002
works in water or Zowie both work and it

3116.38 --> 3123.309
makes it delicious absolutely awesome

3118.269 --> 3126.7
and I use it too for example plants that

3123.309 --> 3131.44
I get water I tend to use it on that too

3126.7 --> 3134.47
and the plants really like it so yeah

3131.44 --> 3137.349
there's so I both filter and energize

3134.47 --> 3142.24
the water so no filtering through dirty

3137.349 --> 3150.069
socks huh sorry no filter in the water

3142.24 --> 3152.0789999999997
through dirty socks yeah interesting in

3150.069 --> 3155.14
Puerto Rico in my uncle's house they had

3152.079 --> 3156.9100000000003
a real source of spring water you say

3155.14 --> 3159.18
Mountain you know in the middle of the

3156.91 --> 3162.3689999999997
forest and there was always this little

3159.18 --> 3164.74
water you know water you know source

3162.369 --> 3167.0190000000002
coming out I'm for over a hundred years

3164.74 --> 3170.2299999999996
they created some pipes and some stuff

3167.019 --> 3172.4799999999996
around and that was like the best water

3170.23 --> 3175.15
up there era that water I used to just

3172.48 --> 3177.549
died dig put my head in there and all

3175.15 --> 3178.96
day just the spring water coming out of

3177.549 --> 3180.49
my head and everybody drinking it I'm

3178.96 --> 3182.5
getting him buckets and Garland's for

3180.49 --> 3186.519
drinking that was the main source of

3182.5 --> 3190.769
that old you know the old that water is

3186.519 --> 3193.839
probably highly mineralized also and

3190.769 --> 3196.0589999999997
just that sounds amazing

3193.839 --> 3198.099
yeah well it was a natural filtration

3196.059 --> 3200.289
because if we kept going up the hill you

3198.099 --> 3202.48
know following the path of the little

3200.289 --> 3203.079
water what they was coming and it was

3202.48 --> 3206.229
going like

3203.079 --> 3208.2090000000003
under the under the dirt I'm up there at

3206.229 --> 3211.0589999999997
the dirt and he was a bunch of you know

3208.209 --> 3213.219
weed and grass and stuff but that was

3211.059 --> 3216.8190000000004
that was the filter it was just pure

3213.219 --> 3218.92
really good water man yeah yeah that's

3216.819 --> 3220.9
good stuff well it is kind of the same

3218.92 --> 3225.64
concept ceramic filtered water is

3220.9 --> 3229.089
basically a layer of ceramics kind of

3225.64 --> 3231.549
like chalk but more solid and the water

3229.089 --> 3235.0589999999997
goes through that and spring water is

3231.549 --> 3238.749
almost exactly like that it just it's

3235.059 --> 3241.299
raining water leaking in through the

3238.749 --> 3243.6699999999996
porous rocks and the porous rocks

3241.299 --> 3245.619
filters all that water and enriches it

3243.67 --> 3247.9590000000003
with minerals that are also stuck in it

3245.619 --> 3250.9590000000003
and that's how you get this amazing

3247.959 --> 3254.91
spring water and so I got that system

3250.959 --> 3257.6499999999996
kind of miniaturized in a tank looks

3254.91 --> 3259.299
yeah and there was a really old man like

3257.65 --> 3261.4300000000003
the owner of one of the house world a

3259.299 --> 3263.709
little little paddle the water go

3261.43 --> 3265.479
through and you see on there oh man like

3263.709 --> 3267.6699999999996
walking around all the whole pad just

3265.479 --> 3269.799
looking to see if there's any dead

3267.67 --> 3271.569
animal or rotten something and they were

3269.799 --> 3273.19
just always looking around because they

3271.569 --> 3275.049
knew all the whole neighborhood you know

3273.19 --> 3277.66
a couple hundred people drink water from

3275.049 --> 3280.959
there it's like a never complain yet

3277.66 --> 3284.2889999999998
it's like an aqueduct together it's a

3280.959 --> 3287.739
lifeline yeah yeah be careful that

3284.289 --> 3291.849
nobody screws around with it and and

3287.739 --> 3293.65
then it's cleaned yeah yeah that was

3291.849 --> 3296.079
yeah that was good people up there man

3293.65 --> 3297.759
yeah it was Oh everybody was like family

3296.079 --> 3300.13
like like a big tree and all the

3297.759 --> 3301.869
branches everybody was the own cause the

3300.13 --> 3303.88
costings and their little nephews and

3301.869 --> 3306.579
nieces so everybody used to play around

3303.88 --> 3313.599
and respect big time that part of the

3306.579 --> 3316.989
nature sounds amazing yep good times

3313.599 --> 3320.619
there all right let's get out of here
