215.37 --> 219.38
welcome to the show Heather way for one

225.17 --> 233.45999999999998
so yeah uh did actually stay up quite

229.98 --> 239.7
late this evening watching streams lots

233.46 --> 243.15
of streams I think I did didn't really

239.7 --> 247.88
miss out on anything yesterday wasn't

243.15 --> 250.95000000000002
distracted by some series on Netflix

247.88 --> 255.78
let's see oh yeah Martin Lydia had some

250.95 --> 259.799
great hangouts yesterday about aqua tech

255.78 --> 261.84
that was really new to me in a way it

259.799 --> 265.97999999999996
was sort of new to me but it was more in

261.84 --> 270.03
depth very very fascinating martin Liddy

265.98 --> 275.19
basically presented a concept that many

270.03 --> 279.35999999999996
ancient buildings even presumably Roman

275.19 --> 282.18
buildings were not like stages or

279.36 --> 287.46000000000004
anything but may have originally be part

282.18 --> 291.96
of an aquifer system and it has a

287.46 --> 294.78
specific type of design with like an

291.96 --> 298.04999999999995
upside-down pyramid staircase in which

294.78 --> 300.14
water water is kept and I get the

298.05 --> 303.84000000000003
feeling there's really something to it

300.14 --> 307.28999999999996
it apparently energizes the water when

303.84 --> 311.52
you store it like that very very

307.29 --> 315.39000000000004
fascinating to me and even more

311.52 --> 319.64
interesting in modern times this type of

315.39 --> 324.69
water storage is being used I've seen it

319.64 --> 329.84999999999997
I've seen aquifers with the upside down

324.69 --> 332.85
pyramid type staircase design in modern

329.85 --> 334.53000000000003
times it's used right now in several

332.85 --> 337.62
places in the world I've seen them I've

334.53 --> 340.83
seen photos of it from modern times it

337.62 --> 343.22
being in use so it's being reapplied

340.83 --> 346.33
it's not just widely talked about

343.22 --> 348.8
but that's good it's good we need more

346.33 --> 352.31
energized water more a higher quality

348.8 --> 355.49
water also Martin showed a couple of

352.31 --> 358.67
pictures that blew me away from a

355.49 --> 362.27
spiritual angle because seeing those

358.67 --> 366.41
photographs I think I think I may

362.27 --> 369.10999999999996
actually saw some of those interiors of

366.41 --> 372.26000000000005
water storage places with the stairs

369.11 --> 374.48
down in the water I think I saw that

372.26 --> 376.55
with my own eyes when I was young I

374.48 --> 379.34000000000003
actually went there and it blew me away

376.55 --> 384.41
back then and think even somebody told

379.34 --> 387.67999999999995
me that it was like a special design to

384.41 --> 389.81
electrify the water and I had no idea

387.68 --> 392.51
back then and what that even meant I

389.81 --> 394.28000000000003
just thought electrified electricity

392.51 --> 396.56
electricity is scared I'm not going in

394.28 --> 399.95
there I'm scared of electricity so I

396.56 --> 402.17
just didn't get at all what was going on

399.95 --> 405.95
back then but yeah seeing that photo

402.17 --> 407.54
again it just bang immediately like I

405.95 --> 411.71
know this I've seen this I've seen this

407.54 --> 414.11
with my own eyes I recognize it and well

411.71 --> 416.12
it might be it might have been some kind

414.11 --> 420.11
of dark world experience but somehow in

416.12 --> 422.15
my mind it keeps suggesting that I've

420.11 --> 424.58000000000004
seen that physically with my own eyes

422.15 --> 426.56
when I was younger and I don't know I

424.58 --> 428.419
don't know where these photographs were

426.56 --> 432.5
even taken they would have probably have

428.419 --> 434.53999999999996
to be in Amsterdam or in in the

432.5 --> 436.25
Netherlands somewhere because otherwise

434.54 --> 440.33000000000004
I highly doubt that I've actually

436.25 --> 443.27
physically visited or it would have to

440.33 --> 443.84
be like in Spain or something I kind of

443.27 --> 446.84
doubt it

443.84 --> 451.42999999999995
so I think I either have seen it in the

446.84 --> 454.52
Netherlands at some point or or it's a

451.43 --> 455.72
dark world experience like yeah can't

454.52 --> 458.12
put it any other way but yeah

455.72 --> 461.26000000000005
fascinating stream by Martin littke a

458.12 --> 467.3
very interesting theme Aquatech

461.26 --> 469.94
antiquity a quat technology yeah I kind

467.3 --> 471.79
of did miss out on the Amsterdam stream

469.94 --> 477.66
the second one

471.79 --> 481.48
and instead watched Patricia Astaire's

477.66 --> 483.13000000000005
stream interview the guy talked starting

481.48 --> 485.23
out about Paul McCartney when they first

483.13 --> 486.73
started up something went technically

485.23 --> 488.26
wrong and it was shut down and then

486.73 --> 491.38
sometime later they started back up

488.26 --> 494.23
again you got in there halfway and yeah

491.38 --> 499.24
followed that was very interesting and

494.23 --> 502.93
then finally this morning rant II did a

499.24 --> 506.14
live stream again showed off his awesome

502.93 --> 508.24
new house quite jealous of that and he

506.14 --> 510.15999999999997
spoke out about his very serious

508.24 --> 513.27
concerns about the infighting within

510.16 --> 517.47
Flat Earth and the lack of cohesion

513.27 --> 520.78
while he suggested that the ballers are

517.47 --> 525.4
politically unified really when it comes

520.78 --> 528.64
down to yeah their globe defense and he

525.4 --> 532.72
has a good point and I'd like to discuss

528.64 --> 537.01
this more in depth with him on my show I

532.72 --> 540.1600000000001
invited him I sent him a link I don't

537.01 --> 542.74
know if he has time I haven't seen him

540.16 --> 545.1999999999999
respond yet but maybe he'll come on my

542.74 --> 547.75
family and discuss this I have some

545.2 --> 550.7800000000001
ideas I'd like to discuss it with him

547.75 --> 553.63
not just me talking about in the open so

550.78 --> 557.3199999999999
we'll see if he joins I'm also open for

553.63 --> 560.05
other panel members I put it out in the

557.32 --> 562.75
early bird chat and if nobody's gonna

560.05 --> 567.5799999999999
come and visit I'll just put it out in

562.75 --> 569.5
the chat again and see if anyone anyone

567.58 --> 573.5400000000001
from the chat is willing to join and

569.5 --> 582.25
talk so

573.54 --> 586.6899999999999
yeah yeah but yeah apparently Randy had

582.25 --> 589.39
a lot of issues explained how he

586.69 --> 592.2090000000001
basically spent too much time on flat

589.39 --> 593.649
earth and not making money with his job

592.209 --> 597.79
and that actually prevented him from

593.649 --> 601.42
getting a bank loan to get a house

597.79 --> 605.709
originally but yeah it kind of didn't

601.42 --> 607.959
work out eventually but yeah good to see

605.709 --> 612.67
an update from Randy he did almost

607.959 --> 616.8699999999999
actually delete his channel so but he's

612.67 --> 619.899
yeah I don't think he did it after or

616.87 --> 624.25
may have actually deleted some videos

619.899 --> 628.06
I'm not sure maybe I I don't recall if

624.25 --> 630.279
he said that he did actually delete

628.06 --> 632.8
videos but I presume that if he did

630.279 --> 636.58
it'll probably be the more infighting

632.8 --> 638.74
related ones or maybe he hasn't deleted

636.58 --> 641.2
anything I don't know I'd have to have

638.74 --> 644.41
him here face to face to be sure and ask

641.2 --> 647.2900000000001
him but yeah maybe maybe he'll join

644.41 --> 649.8389999999999
today a little bit later or maybe after

647.29 --> 652.8389999999999
that oh yeah oh yeah ramble job oh

649.839 --> 655.87
thanks for reminding me and the Israeli

652.839 --> 659.3800000000001
moon landing I saw yeah almost forgot

655.87 --> 664.12
about it I Jaron from Jerry nism went

659.38 --> 666.579
live and yeah during the moon landing

664.12 --> 669.64
during a moon landing that apparently

666.579 --> 670.77
Israel was doing just on the spot it was

669.64 --> 678.279
hilarious

670.77 --> 680.62
they admittedly even gave a CGI 3d hello

678.279 --> 682.6
hello Randy let me finish my story

680.62 --> 684.94
thanks for joining I just want to finish

682.6 --> 687.16
the story I'll be with you in in a few

684.94 --> 689.8900000000001
minutes but yeah talking about the

687.16 --> 692.23
Israeli moon landing they showed it CGI

689.89 --> 694.18
all the way all of it was like yeah this

692.23 --> 697.75
is where it is supposed to be this is

694.18 --> 701.7399999999999
the CGI that's lockstep synchronous with

697.75 --> 705.07
what is happening out there no actual

701.74 --> 706.25
camera footage at all not even of a

705.07 --> 709.49
launch

706.25 --> 713.36
nothing it was all a 3d simulation

709.49 --> 717.6800000000001
basically portrayed as real and then the

713.36 --> 721.3000000000001
simulation craft virtually crashed

717.68 --> 724.8199999999999
apparently so they failed they crashed

721.3 --> 727.01
we didn't get to see anything but it was

724.82 --> 729.8900000000001
just said oh oh it crashed

727.01 --> 733.61
oh no more footage it's over now great

729.89 --> 736.76
job everyone Bibi Netanyahu addressed I

733.61 --> 740.0
was great oh I think it was a success

736.76 --> 744.92
after all even though it crashed it's

740.0 --> 746.24
just it was kind of embarrassing in a

744.92 --> 748.6999999999999
way funny though

746.24 --> 751.3100000000001
but embarrassing and I've heard some

748.7 --> 755.57
other speculate about it that they may

751.31 --> 760.0999999999999
have done this to kind of hand NASA and

755.57 --> 762.0500000000001
other space agency a a rebuttal when

760.1 --> 764.3000000000001
people ask them why aren't you going to

762.05 --> 766.88
the moon and then they can say oh yeah

764.3 --> 768.62
well Israel recently tried it but it

766.88 --> 772.93
crashed and yeah there's just too much

768.62 --> 775.37
complications now we can't for public

772.93 --> 777.8299999999999
appearance or something try that again

775.37 --> 781.16
because everybody's skeptical we won't

777.83 --> 783.5
get the finances to probably they did it

781.16 --> 786.5889999999999
just to create to be able to create this

783.5 --> 789.32
type of response stories I thought that

786.589 --> 790.5500000000001
concept that idea was very sensible so

789.32 --> 793.94
yeah it could have been that they did it

790.55 --> 795.8599999999999
specifically for that and that's why

793.94 --> 800.45
they kept the cheap and simple anyway

795.86 --> 805.7
hello Randy welcome to the early bird

800.45 --> 819.0200000000001
show thanks for joining man so how are

805.7 --> 825.589
you doing so you got a couple of hundred

819.02 --> 827.6
hours to to watch all right so hey how

825.589 --> 835.2800000000001
are you doing I heard you had back

827.6 --> 836.36
troubles what happened it's not my right

835.28 --> 840.439
lung

836.36 --> 843.589
so it's pretty screwed the minute but

840.439 --> 846.5889999999999
it'll get back screwed what what type is

843.589 --> 850.339
like bronchial bronchitis or it's really

846.589 --> 856.7900000000001
a right so just a cold getting out of

850.339 --> 860.389
hand miss me well and it makes you cough

856.79 --> 864.049
and cough and cough hmm coughing so much

860.389 --> 867.949
that I cracked two ribs Oh what holy

864.049 --> 870.199
[ __ ] you cracked oh actually not bruised

867.949 --> 871.79
him but actually cracked him actually

870.199 --> 874.3689999999999
correct that is crazy

871.79 --> 877.459
yeah I was I went back to the hospital

874.369 --> 878.869
yesterday sadly they had me in so the

877.459 --> 880.3389999999999
x-rayed mean they did a bunch of other

878.869 --> 884.269
tests just to make sure there was

880.339 --> 886.22
nothing else an ECG and tested my liver

884.269 --> 887.929
function and all this kind of stuff just

886.22 --> 892.279
because of the pain that I mean you know

887.929 --> 895.22
it's it hurts still yeah from the ribs

892.279 --> 898.399
are from the lung which well it's from

895.22 --> 899.8090000000001
the ribs the pleurisy pretty much

898.399 --> 902.809
cleared up now I've finished the

899.809 --> 905.029
antibiotics on that I've got a little

902.809 --> 906.259
bit of a cough left nothing much but

905.029 --> 909.47
it's the ribs now because I've been

906.259 --> 912.499
coughing so much ribs and all the

909.47 --> 917.6890000000001
muscles down the right-hand side in that

912.499 --> 920.239
area they're all torn yeah all spasmed

917.689 --> 925.309
up again yes yeah

920.239 --> 929.9590000000001
all right now hurts it slightly started

925.309 --> 932.48
with this flu yeah and you wouldn't

929.959 --> 935.1189999999999
think a flu would cause so many issues

932.48 --> 936.919
there was the flu then it led on to the

935.119 --> 940.029
chest infection which led them to the

936.919 --> 943.989
pure flirty led on to the broken ribs

940.029 --> 949.369
right all from the flu

943.989 --> 952.0690000000001
well a flu in my in my view approaching

949.369 --> 957.379
it from alternative medical angle is

952.069 --> 959.929
basically a transformation process Jesus

957.379 --> 967.61
dude

959.929 --> 967.61
be careful be careful man

968.759 --> 974.85
right so I just pushed myself up on the

973.11 --> 982.8290000000001
side to get further back in the couch

974.85 --> 986.629
and forgot about that sorry to hear that

982.829 --> 990.5999999999999
I wanted to kind of ask you if you tried

986.629 --> 993.66
like using a colloidal silver spray it's

990.6 --> 996.749
like because it's is lung related and

993.66 --> 1000.529
since it is an infection it might be

996.749 --> 1003.589
very useful as an acute acute fighting

1000.529 --> 1006.889
off of the infection infection effect

1003.589 --> 1008.4490000000001
just spray colloidal silver on your back

1006.889 --> 1013.389
on the live stream I caught you laughing

1008.449 --> 1016.519
about pain sorry it's just a timing

1013.389 --> 1018.379
I'm not laughing really at your expense

1016.519 --> 1021.079
no I saw I would laugh at my expense

1018.379 --> 1023.809
foods on the other side of you know if

1021.079 --> 1026.27
you add the laughing so I don't hold it

1023.809 --> 1029.74
again Yeah right okay I just didn't

1026.27 --> 1033.039
expect that to happen right now that's

1029.74 --> 1035.809
so stupid

1033.039 --> 1037.699
all right well look I have it sometimes

1035.809 --> 1039.47
in my own it's not gonna be as bad as

1037.699 --> 1043.669
you got it right now but like sometimes

1039.47 --> 1047.179
I suddenly get back problems and like

1043.669 --> 1049.46
things just don't fit any more correctly

1047.179 --> 1051.02
and you get like twisted up and then

1049.46 --> 1052.49
when you forget about that because

1051.02 --> 1054.8899999999999
you've been sitting in a certain way

1052.49 --> 1057.3700000000001
very long it's like okay I'm just gonna

1054.89 --> 1057.3700000000001
stand up

1058.65 --> 1064.92
so that yeah I know how that is very

1061.83 --> 1069.78
annoying although yeah ribs can be very

1064.92 --> 1071.7
painful so I'm finding I've never had

1069.78 --> 1076.29
broken ribs before hmm

1071.7 --> 1078.72
say that I haven't actually bought that

1076.29 --> 1083.48
works I was a lot younger you've been a

1078.72 --> 1085.8
while got the paint all right ya know

1083.48 --> 1092.46
what's new what's new where you are when

1085.8 --> 1094.23
uh I got a patreon we really yeah I just

1092.46 --> 1096.809
did that yes I already got somebody

1094.23 --> 1099.69
subscribing to it Brendon I basically

1096.809 --> 1101.4289999999999
started up because she said yeah you

1099.69 --> 1104.22
should do a patreon I'll be your first

1101.429 --> 1106.6200000000001
subscriber so yeah so I was like okay

1104.22 --> 1110.04
okay if I'm gonna get a subscriber

1106.62 --> 1111.87
immediately anyway why not and so many

1110.04 --> 1115.61
others are doing it Nathan's doing it I

1111.87 --> 1118.1699999999998
don't know are you do you use patreon oh

1115.61 --> 1121.26
yeah but you know I don't really promote

1118.17 --> 1124.2
it too much I mentioned it probably

1121.26 --> 1125.67
twice three times now it's just one of

1124.2 --> 1128.5800000000002
those things that people want to support

1125.67 --> 1130.5
the no patreon there's a lot of people

1128.58 --> 1134.49
on patreon if you if you search for them

1130.5 --> 1137.46
you'll find them so you know you don't

1134.49 --> 1139.23
have to most people want to vote you

1137.46 --> 1140.94
little go out of the way to just look

1139.23 --> 1142.83
you won't miss out all right

1140.94 --> 1145.26
yeah well patreon the funny thing about

1142.83 --> 1147.33
patreon is it's a little bit more

1145.26 --> 1149.429
flexible there are some creative room

1147.33 --> 1155.55
you can actually do with the patreon and

1149.429 --> 1157.89
even like yeah make a prize system or

1155.55 --> 1160.52
some special reward there's so much you

1157.89 --> 1162.929
can do with patreon like even make

1160.52 --> 1165.3899999999999
sponsored votes you can have like a poll

1162.929 --> 1167.64
I've seen other people do this for a

1165.39 --> 1169.41
very long time like movie reviewers they

1167.64 --> 1172.0200000000002
just say okay I got three movies here

1169.41 --> 1174.45
which one do you want me to review the

1172.02 --> 1177.99
next time and you basically fought with

1174.45 --> 1181.02
with paying with so you say okay I'm put

1177.99 --> 1182.67
my five dollars on this movie and then

1181.02 --> 1184.47
that way they get some income and

1182.67 --> 1186.54
there's a choice and everybody's happy

1184.47 --> 1189.929
so it's very interesting what you can do

1186.54 --> 1190.51
with patreon well you know I mean but

1189.929 --> 1193.51
here's the

1190.51 --> 1195.37
another is another thing yeah I was

1193.51 --> 1198.39
talking earlier on my stream and saying

1195.37 --> 1201.85
that you know what more can I do

1198.39 --> 1203.44
observation wise down here where I'm you

1201.85 --> 1207.37
know where I lived at the moment mm-hmm

1203.44 --> 1210.0700000000002
you know what more is it to learn you

1207.37 --> 1212.59
know essentially I don't think I'm going

1210.07 --> 1214.48
to find anything new over the next year

1212.59 --> 1217.6899999999998
or so if I did the same thing this year

1214.48 --> 1220.96
because you know we've already dissected

1217.69 --> 1223.89
Lee didn't very Mirage the compression

1220.96 --> 1228.16
and we've also seen shore to shore

1223.89 --> 1230.17
flatness over what 80 miles so you know

1228.16 --> 1232.42
what else is that to actually show in

1230.17 --> 1236.43
this location because all the people are

1232.42 --> 1239.1100000000001
now taking this this new knowledge and

1236.43 --> 1240.8200000000002
expanding on it and you in their

1239.11 --> 1244.2099999999998
locations and applying it to their

1240.82 --> 1247.24
observations so I don't feel that

1244.21 --> 1248.8600000000001
there's anything more I can do you know

1247.24 --> 1251.5
I mean I'll still do the observations

1248.86 --> 1255.85
wrong I'll still release a video that

1251.5 --> 1258.25
shows perfect right or the compression

1255.85 --> 1259.9599999999998
and the interview Mirage you know and

1258.25 --> 1262.0
also at the bunkie Lumina you know other

1259.96 --> 1265.81
people can follow up that work too so

1262.0 --> 1270.04
it's all there for them but like working

1265.81 --> 1272.9199999999998
with rude earther who when we went down

1270.04 --> 1274.75
to Wales with him to do that observation

1272.92 --> 1277.21
down there and the tests that we're

1274.75 --> 1278.83
trying to perform with the boat we got

1277.21 --> 1279.07
some brilliant results don't get me

1278.83 --> 1281.74
wrong

1279.07 --> 1285.07
perfect flatness you know I mean about

1281.74 --> 1287.71
that was what 15 foot being total height

1285.07 --> 1290.83
you seen that at 10 miles away you know

1287.71 --> 1294.88
it's impossible so you know within kind

1290.83 --> 1296.6799999999998
of oh yeah yeah there was awesome so

1294.88 --> 1299.38
we've got it we've got these things in

1296.68 --> 1301.3
the bag or black for instance going to

1299.38 --> 1303.25
Scotland enduring this observation up

1301.3 --> 1305.08
there and you know we've got a few

1303.25 --> 1308.14
things planned up there but essentially

1305.08 --> 1310.4199999999998
that's going to cost a lot of money to

1308.14 --> 1312.67
do that I mean just get in there for

1310.42 --> 1315.5500000000002
instance it's IRS's awful long way from

1312.67 --> 1317.92
where I live driving it then staying

1315.55 --> 1319.6499999999999
over for perhaps two or three nights to

1317.92 --> 1321.3300000000002
actually you know

1319.65 --> 1324.21
drive up there take eight hours to get

1321.33 --> 1326.28
there oh you got to stay over then I

1324.21 --> 1327.96
want to do a time-lapse video across the

1326.28 --> 1329.82
lake so I'm going to do that throughout

1327.96 --> 1333.15
the day then the following day I also

1329.82 --> 1334.08
want to do some tests and then the

1333.15 --> 1336.39
office is gonna have to stay the night

1334.08 --> 1339.3
again but the time you incorporate all

1336.39 --> 1344.46
about in financially talking what six

1339.3 --> 1348.3
seven pound at least in fuel bed and

1344.46 --> 1350.19
breakfast stain equipment you know some

1348.3 --> 1351.57
of the tests that we want to do know

1350.19 --> 1354.0
easily that sort of money

1351.57 --> 1356.34
well patreon doesn't pay that you know I

1354.0 --> 1359.28
mean I get around a month on patreon so

1356.34 --> 1362.61
you know when you think about it it

1359.28 --> 1364.26
would be nice if you had let's say three

1362.61 --> 1366.36
or four hundred pound per month from

1364.26 --> 1369.83
Haiti on because eventually you could do

1366.36 --> 1374.2099999999998
this kind of thing and expand on this

1369.83 --> 1377.3999999999999
this kind of thought experiment and work

1374.21 --> 1379.02
throughout the year so if I had that

1377.4 --> 1380.5800000000002
sort of money in finances to do that I

1379.02 --> 1382.94
could go to these different places and

1380.58 --> 1385.1999999999998
do these throughout the whole of the UK

1382.94 --> 1387.24
so and I could probably get through say

1385.2 --> 1390.05
six of these throughout the year which

1387.24 --> 1395.07
would in my opinion probably be better

1390.05 --> 1396.12
than doing daily observations down at

1395.07 --> 1398.73
the beach now because I've done that

1396.12 --> 1401.6699999999998
last year all that works in the back now

1398.73 --> 1403.92
it's done and compression if you Mirage

1401.67 --> 1406.17
it's all it's all it's all done now hmm

1403.92 --> 1409.88
let's do something different let's let's

1406.17 --> 1412.88
do some different things that can help

1409.88 --> 1414.99
you know show it in a different way so

1412.88 --> 1417.24
but the problem is like I say it costs

1414.99 --> 1419.13
money to do that yeah and like say with

1417.24 --> 1420.9
patreon it's all right

1419.13 --> 1423.15
saying the patreon or if you've got a

1420.9 --> 1424.65
lot of patreon but if you're not got a

1423.15 --> 1426.45
lot of patreon so it doesn't seem

1424.65 --> 1428.94
worthwhile do and I'll take away because

1426.45 --> 1431.22
the backlash you get from people with

1428.94 --> 1435.06
you having a patreon now it's really

1431.22 --> 1435.99
about you should really not listen to

1435.06 --> 1437.94
that at all

1435.99 --> 1439.83
yeah well what they'll do they'll say

1437.94 --> 1441.66
you're only doing it for the money and

1439.83 --> 1444.26
you're doing it for a purpose and the

1441.66 --> 1446.0700000000002
reason now so you have a bias towards

1444.26 --> 1449.52
Flat Earth

1446.07 --> 1451.32
nobody cares yeah get what this is this

1449.52 --> 1453.75
is what gets banded around

1451.32 --> 1455.22
so you get banded around saying that

1453.75 --> 1456.69
you're only in it for the money then

1455.22 --> 1459.15
other people start talking about it

1456.69 --> 1461.3400000000001
you're only in it for the money so you

1459.15 --> 1464.3400000000001
hear that from one or two people before

1461.34 --> 1466.56
it's ten people are talking about it and

1464.34 --> 1467.79
then you know that's all you ever hear

1466.56 --> 1469.32
you're in it for the money you in it for

1467.79 --> 1470.28
the money it's all about the money quiet

1469.32 --> 1472.1399999999999
down

1470.28 --> 1475.08
don't go there need it it's [ __ ]

1472.14 --> 1477.93
Randy don't don't even entertain it it's

1475.08 --> 1480.24
[ __ ] nobody cares if you just watch

1477.93 --> 1481.26
you can solve this very lazy dish you

1480.24 --> 1483.1200000000001
can let me finish

1481.26 --> 1485.31
but what money isn't it for me

1483.12 --> 1486.87
personally what money isn't it there's

1485.31 --> 1488.31
not very much money in it for it and

1486.87 --> 1490.3799999999999
when you consider the work that I've

1488.31 --> 1492.1399999999999
done and the expense that's come into

1490.38 --> 1494.8200000000002
doing the kind of stuff that we've done

1492.14 --> 1497.19
like just go into Wales for instance was

1494.82 --> 1499.23
a full day there and probably cost about

1497.19 --> 1501.3600000000001
80 quid in total to get there get back

1499.23 --> 1502.71
probably more actually with taxes and

1501.36 --> 1506.1599999999999
there to get a taxi as well can a car

1502.71 --> 1508.71
was broke so you had all that kind of

1506.16 --> 1510.9
factor all about in and the glow that

1508.71 --> 1512.49
you know the trolls or even the flat

1510.9 --> 1514.23
lizards that would call you out for

1512.49 --> 1516.84
doing it for the money don't take that

1514.23 --> 1518.97
into account it is the fact that what I

1516.84 --> 1520.98
spent just go into Wales for incident

1518.97 --> 1522.81
which was 80 to 90 pound it was

1520.98 --> 1524.67
essentially last three months of patreon

1522.81 --> 1527.01
money and I've only been doing patreon

1524.67 --> 1528.78
for six months you know so straightaway

1527.01 --> 1534.06
that's half of the money gone already

1528.78 --> 1535.74
just to do in doing this and you know so

1534.06 --> 1538.23
to get called that you're doing it for

1535.74 --> 1540.27
the money is you know it is it brings

1538.23 --> 1541.68
you down to me personally at how it's

1540.27 --> 1543.24
bringing me down it's like what these

1541.68 --> 1545.22
people want me to do they want me to

1543.24 --> 1547.95
just get go bankrupt doing all this kind

1545.22 --> 1550.26
but why are you entertaining its lies

1547.95 --> 1551.94
it's just now is really effort into it

1550.26 --> 1553.95
putting all the time into it putting all

1551.94 --> 1556.26
the work into it and it seems that even

1553.95 --> 1557.88
though all the work that I've done which

1556.26 --> 1560.1299999999999
was the compression in theory morality

1557.88 --> 1562.65
observations a lot of people are now

1560.13 --> 1564.6000000000001
taking forward and I'm working about all

1562.65 --> 1566.64
that gets forgetting the gun once you

1564.6 --> 1568.98
start patreon or once you start working

1566.64 --> 1571.98
the defi core it's like come on now you

1568.98 --> 1573.51
know I'm doing this for the community

1571.98 --> 1576.0
but I'm getting [ __ ] for it and it feels

1573.51 --> 1576.87
like I don't want to get I don't want to

1576.0 --> 1579.12
have that anymore

1576.87 --> 1582.1499999999999
yeah right don't wanna share anymore

1579.12 --> 1584.4399999999998
well yeah it's just another layer of

1582.15 --> 1587.41
trolls you should really

1584.44 --> 1590.6200000000001
totally ignore it because the people

1587.41 --> 1594.76
that are being pro you because you're

1590.62 --> 1598.3799999999999
not asking money what they really want

1594.76 --> 1600.22
is you to go bankrupt and lose your home

1598.38 --> 1604.7800000000002
do you understand

1600.22 --> 1607.0
well but do you please another them do

1604.78 --> 1608.8
you understand that that's what what

1607.0 --> 1611.68
they're really doing that for its just

1608.8 --> 1614.8799999999999
whining troller [ __ ] - peer pressure you

1611.68 --> 1618.3400000000001
into maneuvering your decision-making

1614.88 --> 1621.25
away from being able to manage yourself

1618.34 --> 1623.53
and you can solve this very easily by

1621.25 --> 1625.39
literally every video where you go how

1623.53 --> 1629.17
do you weigh to go somewhere and pay

1625.39 --> 1632.5300000000002
money by literally presenting the bill

1629.17 --> 1634.75
just saying this cost it to me this is

1632.53 --> 1637.92
how much I got for my patreon all that

1634.75 --> 1640.69
to compensate this is what I'm paying

1637.92 --> 1644.53
this gone it's gone and this is what I

1640.69 --> 1647.41
am bleeding for this to happen there's

1644.53 --> 1651.1299999999999
no profit if you do that a couple of

1647.41 --> 1654.3600000000001
times the whining will stop well it got

1651.13 --> 1656.5
to around about September last year

1654.36 --> 1658.6
probably a little bit before actually

1656.5 --> 1660.31
and I applied for a mortgage on a

1658.6 --> 1663.01
different property not the one that I'm

1660.31 --> 1666.82
yeah I mean now I heard you on this

1663.01 --> 1670.06
glass dream yeah yeah so I put in for a

1666.82 --> 1672.3999999999999
mortgage and the bank refused me the

1670.06 --> 1676.03
mortgage the for the amount that I

1672.4 --> 1678.94
wanted and so essentially I needed to

1676.03 --> 1681.34
get a bigger deposit together so that

1678.94 --> 1683.74
they would allow me to buy the property

1681.34 --> 1686.62
the problem was and the problem arose

1683.74 --> 1687.67
from the fact that the previous year

1686.62 --> 1689.86
which I've done all these these

1687.67 --> 1691.72
observations and down the beach and

1689.86 --> 1694.9599999999998
spending time on Nathan's debates every

1691.72 --> 1697.75
day I was only doing perhaps four hours

1694.96 --> 1700.8600000000001
work a day right well prior to that I've

1697.75 --> 1702.79
been doing 910 hours 11 hours everyday

1700.86 --> 1705.31
self-employed you know that's what you

1702.79 --> 1708.1299999999999
do and I hadn't realized that that flat

1705.31 --> 1711.58
earth is essentially it taken all it

1708.13 --> 1714.8300000000002
taken over my my daily routines just so

1711.58 --> 1717.74
much to such an extent that

1714.83 --> 1719.99
my earning caste in the bank size was

1717.74 --> 1721.429
pretty poor because what I hadn't been

1719.99 --> 1723.11
bringing into the past year was really

1721.429 --> 1725.419
low compared to what I had been earning

1723.11 --> 1726.9499999999998
so it's not surprising that they knock

1725.419 --> 1728.539
me back for the mortgage because they're

1726.95 --> 1730.5800000000002
like anyway wait a minute you are

1728.539 --> 1733.039
mortgaging yet I look at what you

1730.58 --> 1734.36
learned in the past year and it's it's

1733.039 --> 1735.77
not looking good we're not going to give

1734.36 --> 1737.799
you that and that hadn't realized I

1735.77 --> 1740.24
hadn't thought it would be an issue

1737.799 --> 1742.22
genuinely I just did what I did

1740.24 --> 1743.9
yeah I didn't see the consequences of

1742.22 --> 1746.659
what did the amount of time that I put

1743.9 --> 1748.97
into doing clatters hadn't seen the

1746.659 --> 1751.279
consequences that that would lead to and

1748.97 --> 1752.8700000000001
to be knocked back from the mortgage so

1751.279 --> 1754.7
essentially it works out that we lost

1752.87 --> 1756.9799999999998
the house that we were going to buy and

1754.7 --> 1758.69
it caused a lot of problems between me

1756.98 --> 1762.38
and my partner because you know

1758.69 --> 1764.45
obviously fliers gets blamed for all

1762.38 --> 1766.5490000000002
about and it's understandable it gets

1764.45 --> 1768.529
blamed for that because essentially

1766.549 --> 1771.559
that's what caused it if I hadn't gone

1768.529 --> 1775.7
down this this route of trying to do

1771.559 --> 1777.559
this year observation Town Beach I would

1775.7 --> 1779.299
have been working nine ten eleven hours

1777.559 --> 1781.549
every day I'd have got the mortgage that

1779.299 --> 1783.529
would have been an issue of course dad

1781.549 --> 1785.779
then we wouldn't have had shark boat and

1783.529 --> 1789.559
panda boat and all that so yeah about it

1785.779 --> 1792.919
all so I had to step away for a time and

1789.559 --> 1795.11
not be as active to basically try and

1792.919 --> 1796.76
get the money together to put a big

1795.11 --> 1802.9089999999999
deposit down so that I could actually

1796.76 --> 1806.6589999999999
get a mortgage then because I'd have you

1802.909 --> 1808.429
know a bigger deposit or down so

1806.659 --> 1809.659
absolutely we bought this place now so

1808.429 --> 1811.279
eventually we've got everything together

1809.659 --> 1815.0900000000001
we've finally managed to get ourselves

1811.279 --> 1817.58
back on track and so you know when

1815.09 --> 1819.279
people say to me are what youth what do

1817.58 --> 1821.149
you do for Flat Earth what you know

1819.279 --> 1822.08
you're only in it for the money you're

1821.149 --> 1823.9699999999998
only in it for this and the other

1822.08 --> 1827.059
Flowers has called me a lot of [ __ ] in

1823.97 --> 1829.94
that half year and that was just one one

1827.059 --> 1832.19
example just financially just

1829.94 --> 1834.74
financially leave alone all the trolls

1832.19 --> 1837.6490000000001
and all that [ __ ] because that kind of

1834.74 --> 1839.33
that comes on top of there for free not

1837.649 --> 1840.6789999999999
only the work that I've done the time

1839.33 --> 1842.539
and the effort and putting all the

1840.679 --> 1843.799
videos together and going on Nathan and

1842.539 --> 1845.99
doing these observations and the

1843.799 --> 1846.62
financial cuts to do that well then I

1845.99 --> 1849.38
you know

1846.62 --> 1851.9299999999998
lose a house over that to have the

1849.38 --> 1855.1100000000001
problems with the missus because of that

1851.93 --> 1857.45
too and I've not spoke about this before

1855.11 --> 1860.54
so essentially you know I'm only talking

1857.45 --> 1864.0800000000002
about it now today because finally we

1860.54 --> 1865.55
moved into a property together so it

1864.08 --> 1868.34
seems like things are actually getting

1865.55 --> 1870.53
back on track right look whilst this was

1868.34 --> 1872.3899999999999
going on nobody really knew and yet I

1870.53 --> 1875.0
was still appearing on people sure I

1872.39 --> 1878.38
knew I know you told you told me and

1875.0 --> 1881.51
Riley in the back chat a month ago or so

1878.38 --> 1883.3400000000001
yeah but the community didn't know so

1881.51 --> 1885.41
when people say to me what have you done

1883.34 --> 1887.74
what you know what you know it's not

1885.41 --> 1890.63
case of just like what's it costing me

1887.74 --> 1896.0
personally not just financially or

1890.63 --> 1897.6100000000001
mentally and it's cost me a lot you know

1896.0 --> 1900.23
when you're getting questioned a few

1897.61 --> 1902.2099999999998
golbez flat-earthers that are accusing

1900.23 --> 1903.41
you this that and the other and it's all

1902.21 --> 1906.95
[ __ ] lies because they don't know

1903.41 --> 1911.5400000000002
the whole thing it's very frustrating to

1906.95 --> 1912.92
be in that situation yeah it seems like

1911.54 --> 1914.84
they just don't care they just want to

1912.92 --> 1917.75
they want to offer you just want to

1914.84 --> 1919.49
amuse you and usually you know poke you

1917.75 --> 1922.19
all the time stick knives and you and

1919.49 --> 1925.4
it's just tear you down tear you down so

1922.19 --> 1929.15
they feel better it's very childish

1925.4 --> 1931.19
basic behavior not very productive like

1929.15 --> 1935.24
all these people that are accusing you

1931.19 --> 1938.42
of making money or not doing enough they

1935.24 --> 1941.21
do nothing they do absolutely nothing

1938.42 --> 1943.13
but keyboard warrior troll get in

1941.21 --> 1945.83
people's way they don't do anything

1943.13 --> 1948.41
productive at all just spamming and

1945.83 --> 1950.72
being annoying and being mr. or mrs.

1948.41 --> 1953.6000000000001
complaining pants and they don't do

1950.72 --> 1957.77
anything so every time people say that

1953.6 --> 1961.82
it's usually a blatant flamin hypocrisy

1957.77 --> 1965.1399999999999
in your face so that's why I say please

1961.82 --> 1967.82
learn to completely ignore this

1965.14 --> 1970.67
completely it's gonna be hundreds it's

1967.82 --> 1973.55
gonna be hundreds but that momentum is

1970.67 --> 1978.98
only going to be growing and pushing as

1973.55 --> 1980.54
long as you care really because if you

1978.98 --> 1984.85
stop it and just say

1980.54 --> 1988.1
no this is the real picture that is just

1984.85 --> 1991.52
screeching screeching of the trolls in

1988.1 --> 1993.32
the distance whether they be supposedly

1991.52 --> 1996.02
flat-earthers or ballers doesn't even

1993.32 --> 1997.76
matter they're these are just this is

1996.02 --> 2000.28
spam it's spam you shouldn't take it

1997.76 --> 2002.44
seriously because you know what you paid

2000.28 --> 2004.6499999999999
you know what it costs you you know how

2002.44 --> 2007.81
much effort you put into your work and

2004.65 --> 2010.0900000000001
that's the only thing that's real and

2007.81 --> 2012.7
what they say it's just not real and you

2010.09 --> 2015.3999999999999
shouldn't you shouldn't be even

2012.7 --> 2017.0800000000002
intimidated the slightest by it it

2015.4 --> 2019.6000000000001
doesn't matter that they're gonna spread

2017.08 --> 2021.3999999999999
their lies they will do it anyway no

2019.6 --> 2023.5
matter what you present no matter how

2021.4 --> 2025.39
you do it they'll find something and

2023.5 --> 2027.61
they'll spread lies about you that's

2025.39 --> 2029.19
what they do they would with me do it

2027.61 --> 2032.35
with everyone

2029.19 --> 2034.18
yeah you know when you mention patreon

2032.35 --> 2036.34
before and that's how to talk about it

2034.18 --> 2039.0700000000002
now but like I say I mean I've mentioned

2036.34 --> 2041.05
it maybe three times know what times are

2039.07 --> 2043.0
my own channel when we released a video

2041.05 --> 2045.9099999999999
saying that we'll say they paid him up I

2043.0 --> 2048.79
think once on Nathan's and and now you

2045.91 --> 2052.4700000000003
know today that's it you know I mean

2048.79 --> 2055.39
it's not something that I've you know

2052.47 --> 2057.91
promoted in any way or said to everybody

2055.39 --> 2059.89
every single time go to my patreon sign

2057.91 --> 2062.47
up to my patreon help me out financially

2059.89 --> 2064.3199999999997
even though essentially I've been living

2062.47 --> 2066.4599999999996
on the bloody bread line to get this

2064.32 --> 2068.4700000000003
deposit together to the mortgage

2066.46 --> 2070.15
honestly you know I mean if you if

2068.47 --> 2074.1
you're trying to get some money together

2070.15 --> 2076.36
for a purpose you would realize just how

2074.1 --> 2078.19
well when the misses for instance is

2076.36 --> 2079.7200000000003
going bananas because you know you've

2078.19 --> 2081.55
lost the house because you couldn't get

2079.72 --> 2083.35
a mortgage together and then you're

2081.55 --> 2085.15
working twice as hard to get the deposit

2083.35 --> 2088.21
together bigger deposits you can get the

2085.15 --> 2090.31
mortgage and a lot of that meant that

2088.21 --> 2092.77
you know I was living on the breadline

2090.31 --> 2095.56
essentially the money did you hear me

2092.77 --> 2098.47
saying to people that I'm skin or that I

2095.56 --> 2100.63
can't afford this a car for you know are

2098.47 --> 2103.2999999999997
you young dude erupt mention it

2100.63 --> 2105.48
sometimes especially not in the open but

2103.3 --> 2109.15
no I don't hear you complaining at all

2105.48 --> 2109.609
and people say you're only in it for the

2109.15 --> 2111.98
money

2109.609 --> 2113.48
for the money I'd be on saying you know

2111.98 --> 2116.599
guys help me out with some money I'm

2113.48 --> 2123.23
skin I would be I'm not and I don't do

2116.599 --> 2125.809
that you know I'm a very proud person to

2123.23 --> 2128.089
me it's blatantly ridiculous because if

2125.809 --> 2130.3390000000004
you just didn't do the Flat Earth you

2128.089 --> 2132.95
would make so much more money so it

2130.339 --> 2135.47
doesn't make any logical sense that that

2132.95 --> 2139.16
line of reasoning your job makes you a

2135.47 --> 2140.8999999999996
lot of money literally and yeah you you

2139.16 --> 2142.8799999999997
you know how to keep on working and

2140.9 --> 2146.96
really pile on that money Flat Earth

2142.88 --> 2148.839
costs a lot of time and money it doesn't

2146.96 --> 2151.43
make any sense if you would be in

2148.839 --> 2153.23
anything for the money you'd not be

2151.43 --> 2155.269
doing this you just be hanging around

2153.23 --> 2155.869
maybe chatting sometimes and just doing

2155.269 --> 2157.8489999999997
your job

2155.869 --> 2163.069
and making a lot of money so it's

2157.849 --> 2166.489
completely ridiculous since I got the

2163.069 --> 2168.14
flu four weeks ago so I got the flu then

2166.489 --> 2169.819
it turned into chest infection then

2168.14 --> 2172.009
pleurisy and now I've got two cracked

2169.819 --> 2173.69
ribs and I'm literally still stuck to

2172.009 --> 2176.059
the eyeballs on painkillers right now

2173.69 --> 2177.2000000000003
and it's a case of I'm probably not

2176.059 --> 2177.8590000000004
going to get back to work for another

2177.2 --> 2180.499
couple of weeks

2177.859 --> 2182.69
well factor in that that's like six

2180.499 --> 2186.109
weeks that have not been able to earn

2182.69 --> 2189.829
any money on my decorating and I've got

2186.109 --> 2191.5989999999997
jobs highly not highly not piling up I

2189.829 --> 2193.13
could probably employ somebody to work

2191.599 --> 2195.4100000000003
with me for the next three months and

2193.13 --> 2198.4990000000003
still not get through it all wow that's

2195.41 --> 2200.089
good well it's good but I can't do it I

2198.499 --> 2201.98
can't actually get to it I've just moved

2200.089 --> 2206.48
into this house now I've got bills and

2201.98 --> 2208.4
it's like you know this is it's

2206.48 --> 2209.329
frustrating for me because people are

2208.4 --> 2211.2490000000003
saying they're I'm in it for the money

2209.329 --> 2214.46
if I was in it for the money I feel like

2211.249 --> 2214.64
guys give me some money I got bills to

2214.46 --> 2217.4
pay

2214.64 --> 2219.2
I can't work I'm injured blah blah blah

2217.4 --> 2222.349
blah the sob story kind of stuff that

2219.2 --> 2223.0389999999998
people do but it's not me I'll speak

2222.349 --> 2225.23
about it

2223.039 --> 2227.119
I'm not telling people to go and sign up

2225.23 --> 2229.73
to patreon I'm not saying them go and do

2227.119 --> 2233.119
this and do that alright well I will I

2229.73 --> 2235.94
will I will tell everyone in my chat to

2233.119 --> 2238.2200000000003
sign up to Randy's patreon and help him

2235.94 --> 2242.51
out even though he's very proud very

2238.22 --> 2244.52
proud working man help him out

2242.51 --> 2246.32
come on with people wanted to do that in

2244.52 --> 2248.39
their own time we'll find it you know

2246.32 --> 2250.4300000000003
I'm only as good as my last video and

2248.39 --> 2253.22
I'm only as good as people see the work

2250.43 --> 2254.72
that I'm willing to do so I understand

2253.22 --> 2257.3599999999997
that I haven't been as active recently

2254.72 --> 2259.25
so there's no there's no reason for

2257.36 --> 2260.84
people to want to sign up for a patreon

2259.25 --> 2262.67
of course me right now anyway of course

2260.84 --> 2264.77
there is future you know if people want

2262.67 --> 2266.78
to support me in the future three or

2264.77 --> 2268.96
four months down the line let me get

2266.78 --> 2272.15
back into the swing of things with the

2268.96 --> 2274.4
the tests and and stuff that I've got

2272.15 --> 2276.92
coming forth a special team Scotland

2274.4 --> 2279.4700000000003
around a lot on there let them see that

2276.92 --> 2282.05
I'm actively you know carrying on the

2279.47 --> 2284.47
work that them in you know and about

2282.05 --> 2286.6400000000003
that way they can support you know

2284.47 --> 2290.39
support somebody just because the same

2286.64 --> 2293.06
support somebody well I disagree a

2290.39 --> 2295.2799999999997
support ranty send them super chats

2293.06 --> 2297.44
whenever he's live and add to his

2295.28 --> 2300.32
patreon he doesn't like it he doesn't

2297.44 --> 2302.15
like to ask for this and to be fair say

2300.32 --> 2304.82
two years ago I would have felt

2302.15 --> 2307.01
extremely embarrassed to ask something

2304.82 --> 2315.4100000000003
similar but I did it anyway it keeps on

2307.01 --> 2317.15
working and support ranty supported he

2315.41 --> 2320.0
doesn't want it but do it anyway because

2317.15 --> 2323.9300000000003
he needs it and he's done so much for us

2320.0 --> 2326.48
all already so please do support Randy

2323.93 --> 2329.8999999999996
even though he's being very modest about

2326.48 --> 2332.63
it you can use the help and we all know

2329.9 --> 2335.87
you can't keep Randy down for long he

2332.63 --> 2338.38
will even by accident find some new

2335.87 --> 2341.5699999999997
great footage to shoot you'll do it

2338.38 --> 2346.13
because he just can't help it oh and by

2341.57 --> 2348.29
the way going back to the thing what are

2346.13 --> 2351.53
you going to do because I had some

2348.29 --> 2354.5299999999997
things that I thought of that you could

2351.53 --> 2355.4900000000002
do it as a step forward with everything

2354.53 --> 2358.88
you've done so far

2355.49 --> 2364.58
what you've done is footage at ground

2358.88 --> 2369.26
level so maybe a good next experimental

2364.58 --> 2371.27
project could be get a drone get a drone

2369.26 --> 2373.88
and go in the vertical you've done

2371.27 --> 2375.46
everything horizontal now let's see if

2373.88 --> 2378.07
you can get some

2375.46 --> 2380.89
some optical slant migration footage for

2378.07 --> 2385.54
example maybe you could even manage to

2380.89 --> 2388.6299999999997
somehow fit one of your cameras on the

2385.54 --> 2390.91
actual drone and get actual p900 quality

2388.63 --> 2393.01
or beeth 1000 however you're going to

2390.91 --> 2397.2
work that out on the drone now that

2393.01 --> 2405.73
would be pretty impressive if you ask me

2397.2 --> 2409.87
yeah yeah well I've already sort of done

2405.73 --> 2414.73
that on the steps you know by the other

2409.87 --> 2416.35
time so you've got like 30 foot of steps

2414.73 --> 2421.02
that you can go up and go down and have

2416.35 --> 2423.8199999999997
them many of the observations from that

2421.02 --> 2425.23
elevation change of course of course but

2423.82 --> 2427.7200000000003
what you're gonna be doing there is

2425.23 --> 2430.09
basically taking a shot moving a bit and

2427.72 --> 2433.06
then taking another shot comparing it

2430.09 --> 2435.76
the funny thing is with a good drone you

2433.06 --> 2438.61
could literally have a stable drone

2435.76 --> 2440.98
zoomed in and then as it is zoomed in

2438.61 --> 2442.81
move up so you don't have to move it

2440.98 --> 2445.08
away and just compare shots but you

2442.81 --> 2450.0099999999998
could just see it happening right then

2445.08 --> 2451.33
that's a whole different ballgame right

2450.01 --> 2453.6400000000003
and it's the first time I'm going to

2451.33 --> 2456.46
agree with him when he actually says

2453.64 --> 2458.02
that runs he doesn't need to spend any

2456.46 --> 2460.0
more time doing the same thing over and

2458.02 --> 2463.77
over that is quite true because

2460.0 --> 2463.77
essentially this was a year-long

2464.88 --> 2469.57
observation down at the beach and I've

2467.53 --> 2471.4500000000003
managed to do that and now I've got

2469.57 --> 2476.2000000000003
about three and a half terabytes of data

2471.45 --> 2478.81
from that year so know what you say

2476.2 --> 2482.5
you're not gonna learn anything more in

2478.81 --> 2484.15
another year than you are from the

2482.5 --> 2486.4
previous year you know I think he gears

2484.15 --> 2488.26
a long time to to do that although don't

2486.4 --> 2490.36
get me wrong I'll still be taking the

2488.26 --> 2493.0600000000004
p1000 down to the beach on beautiful

2490.36 --> 2494.9500000000003
days to try and see what I can see well

2493.06 --> 2498.04
I don't think there's any any point of

2494.95 --> 2500.68
putting out anything like the in theory

2498.04 --> 2502.48
unless it's really cool you know or

2500.68 --> 2504.41
anything with the inferior Mirage and

2502.48 --> 2506.35
you know come

2504.41 --> 2508.49
I don't really think I really need to

2506.35 --> 2512.5699999999997
expand on that anymore because other

2508.49 --> 2514.04
people are doing that um so in some

2512.57 --> 2516.11
respect I will agree with that

2514.04 --> 2518.69
so what I wanted to do is look at

2516.11 --> 2520.07
something on the next level and what's

2518.69 --> 2521.9900000000002
the next level to do and I know what

2520.07 --> 2524.75
he's saying about the drone and so it's

2521.99 --> 2527.6
a one option another option could be you

2524.75 --> 2531.32
could move migrate from getting beach

2527.6 --> 2534.2
footage typical beach footage to more

2531.32 --> 2536.6000000000004
mountainous footage and just see how

2534.2 --> 2539.12
many my if you can find like a spot

2536.6 --> 2542.0299999999997
somewhere on a high altitude where he

2539.12 --> 2543.8599999999997
can look over vast mountain ranges even

2542.03 --> 2546.1400000000003
into the distance and then start

2543.86 --> 2548.9900000000002
comparing that to more because there are

2546.14 --> 2552.68
some pictures of this but compared to

2548.99 --> 2554.8999999999996
beach photos they're vastly outnumbered

2552.68 --> 2557.81
so and hey England has plenty of

2554.9 --> 2565.12
mountainous and all that so maybe that

2557.81 --> 2565.12
would be a good next phase yes

2565.21 --> 2575.93
comment saying that time lapses might be

2568.52 --> 2578.9
good however if I was to do time lapses

2575.93 --> 2582.3199999999997
and I have the p1000 and the p900 both

2578.9 --> 2585.4100000000003
facing opposite directions and this is

2582.32 --> 2587.6000000000004
interesting actually it's been my theory

2585.41 --> 2590.87
that when you're looking into the Sun or

2587.6 --> 2593.81
the sun's in that general direction you

2590.87 --> 2596.3599999999997
can't see quite as far whereas if you're

2593.81 --> 2600.38
looking and the scenes behind you you

2596.36 --> 2602.36
can see much further so that in my

2600.38 --> 2607.73
location might be worthwhile doing

2602.36 --> 2611.51
because I can film south and I can film

2607.73 --> 2614.45
north at the same time using the p9

2611.51 --> 2620.6000000000004
under the p1000 and I can time-lapse

2614.45 --> 2624.0
Botox and then we can compare hmm okay

2620.6 --> 2627.42
that might be interesting yeah

2624.0 --> 2628.349
right what what's up yeah me indeed I

2627.42 --> 2630.77
almost forgot

2628.349 --> 2635.48
Chris Barry joined as well hello Chris

2630.77 --> 2635.48
hi Chris thanks for joining

2635.54 --> 2643.2599999999998
no I'm on a highway of driving to work I

2640.79 --> 2645.57
was just gonna have a lot of time I was

2643.26 --> 2649.4900000000002
gonna take you all catch like his

2645.57 --> 2653.81
Jordans presentation on Jared last night

2649.49 --> 2658.08
what of it no I didn't catch I saw the

2653.81 --> 2660.9
Israeli moon landing the moon crash and

2658.08 --> 2667.859
that's about it I didn't see any life a

2660.9 --> 2673.23
short presentation after that okay and

2667.859 --> 2678.2599999999998
it was really good he talks about you

2673.23 --> 2681.48
know he's his whole thing is all these

2678.26 --> 2684.09
optical phenomenon that we're seeing

2681.48 --> 2686.58
from people I grantee and Travis a plain

2684.09 --> 2687.9
truth and he's actually somehow I don't

2686.58 --> 2689.369
I didn't understand it all I kind of

2687.9 --> 2691.08
fast forward some of it this was so long

2689.369 --> 2693.9
but I didn't want to kind of get to the

2691.08 --> 2698.93
end he's using formulas and math to

2693.9 --> 2698.9300000000003
calculate why some of these objects are

2699.619 --> 2706.2000000000003
like you know in the white lighthouse

2702.869 --> 2709.17
for example right and he's got he's

2706.2 --> 2710.91
formulas he says match up with why these

2709.17 --> 2713.94
bottoms are missing now the most

2710.91 --> 2716.04
fascinating part of its II he is a now

2713.94 --> 2717.599
and I don't need math formulas I just

2716.04 --> 2718.83
need to look at it and know that you

2717.599 --> 2721.26
know there's other variables to play

2718.83 --> 2722.97
like the atmosphere and refraction right

2721.26 --> 2725.0400000000004
so I don't need the math but it's that

2722.97 --> 2728.2799999999997
might go a long way with people like Ron

2725.04 --> 2729.69
Lewis or whoever but the most the most

2728.28 --> 2732.03
fascinating part of it is basically

2729.69 --> 2734.13
there's really only a couple of let's

2732.03 --> 2736.2000000000003
say to two causes for all these

2734.13 --> 2740.44
observable effects right so you so will

2736.2 --> 2745.06
you talk about compression magnification

2740.44 --> 2746.53
inferior Mirage superior Mirage and what

2745.06 --> 2749.7999999999997
else my missing probably one or two more

2746.53 --> 2753.9700000000003
I'm missing right all those effects it's

2749.8 --> 2756.6600000000003
all refraction right it's all all those

2753.97 --> 2760.75
that I just listed are all refraction

2756.66 --> 2763.0299999999997
prints is what is the conditions right

2760.75 --> 2764.2
yeah I don't know in Fury Moreau

2763.03 --> 2766.36
you have a warmer day you might get a

2764.2 --> 2768.31
superior Mirage or whatever sometimes

2766.36 --> 2771.04
you get mirroring sometimes you don't

2768.31 --> 2773.59
right but it's all the same cause now

2771.04 --> 2775.5099999999998
the only other part of that at play is

2773.59 --> 2777.6400000000003
the angle and that's it and you know and

2775.51 --> 2778.9300000000003
or perspective so as the camera goes up

2777.64 --> 2782.0499999999997
or down you're gonna see more or less of

2778.93 --> 2784.24
the floor those kind of things but it's

2782.05 --> 2786.88
really so you really have a refraction

2784.24 --> 2790.06
and perspective perspective and or angle

2786.88 --> 2792.1
I guess yeah Limited viewing angle which

2790.06 --> 2795.1
falls in the perspective category and

2792.1 --> 2798.19
you have the slight light bending due to

2795.1 --> 2802.08
atmospheric conditions among other that

2798.19 --> 2804.91
that are right on top of that as well

2802.08 --> 2807.64
they're just they're not literally the

2804.91 --> 2809.89
the refraction is not the cause but it

2807.64 --> 2813.37
does have an influence but is mostly

2809.89 --> 2823.81
perspective and the effects there from

2813.37 --> 2827.0699999999997
that cause the obstruction perspective

2823.81 --> 2832.18
as the cause and refraction as like a an

2827.07 --> 2834.55
extra influence well refraction itself

2832.18 --> 2843.12
is not just gonna cause perspective I

2834.55 --> 2845.23
think they go towards the same

2843.12 --> 2849.5499999999997
phenomenon so in other words if you see

2845.23 --> 2852.13
a building that is you know that's 20

2849.55 --> 2854.26
stories you can only see 10 stories well

2852.13 --> 2855.82
that's that's a due to the limited angle

2854.26 --> 2857.7400000000002
right they close the time they're at

2855.82 --> 2861.32
close to the water level so they're very

2857.74 --> 2863.33
very you know low altitude 5 to 10 feet

2861.32 --> 2864.53
so that's a big part of the yes but see

2863.33 --> 2866.54
if you just said okay well it's just

2864.53 --> 2868.4
perspective or just viewing angle well

2866.54 --> 2870.5
no that's not gonna cut it percent of

2868.4 --> 2872.96
the building off you do need something

2870.5 --> 2874.85
else but we have that something else and

2872.96 --> 2876.71
that something else is atmosphere and

2874.85 --> 2880.25
from that atmosphere we get refraction

2876.71 --> 2883.55
and that refraction can along with

2880.25 --> 2884.99
perspective or angle add up to college

2883.55 --> 2890.15
you know those two things can add up to

2884.99 --> 2892.85
missing 50% of a building or a pier or a

2890.15 --> 2896.12
lighthouse or whatever if the distance

2892.85 --> 2897.77
is plenty enough yes exactly and that's

2896.12 --> 2899.2999999999997
the depth of the other part is right so

2897.77 --> 2902.21
many things at play and all just say oh

2899.3 --> 2904.04
well it's curved right no if you're

2902.21 --> 2906.56
looking at you know Tim Osmonds pictures

2904.04 --> 2909.5299999999997
and I was I was talking to him the other

2906.56 --> 2910.7
day on I don't know Jose's and you know

2909.53 --> 2913.1000000000004
he's got these images and he's showing

2910.7 --> 2916.2799999999997
these buildings 26 miles away and I'm

2913.1 --> 2917.75
like well I'm like five towns apart you

2916.28 --> 2919.9700000000003
know you're saying it's a clear day but

2917.75 --> 2923.0
you're between five few and five towns

2919.97 --> 2924.8599999999997
later it's that is the building so how

2923.0 --> 2927.68
can you be sure that five pounds later

2924.86 --> 2930.1400000000003
26 miles later it's clear there right or

2927.68 --> 2931.6099999999997
whatever but the point is is as you look

2930.14 --> 2933.62
through more and more atmosphere you're

2931.61 --> 2935.9900000000002
gonna have the effects are basically

2933.62 --> 2938.39
gonna be almost multiplied right so if

2935.99 --> 2940.8799999999997
you can see refraction at three miles

2938.39 --> 2947.12
and then my god in what is it gonna be

2940.88 --> 2948.8
at 26 miles well according to the Cerf

2947.12 --> 2953.6
calculator there's probably going to be

2948.8 --> 2956.1200000000003
a lot more obstruction correct the

2953.6 --> 2959.9
curvature calculator regularly just says

2956.12 --> 2961.9
okay things are in the fast distance are

2959.9 --> 2964.55
either going to be completely and

2961.9 --> 2966.98
invisible behind the curvature or

2964.55 --> 2970.25
they're gonna be obstructed a lot more

2966.98 --> 2972.26
it I've never seen them actually try it

2970.25 --> 2974.03
out yeah even though it ignores

2972.26 --> 2977.3
perspective and all that and that it

2974.03 --> 2980.75
would work out perfectly it's just seems

2977.3 --> 2984.65
occasionally that it tends to sort of

2980.75 --> 2986.6
work out but more than often yeah we

2984.65 --> 2990.2000000000003
bring certain types of footages like

2986.6 --> 2992.69
especially Randy's sea level footage

2990.2 --> 2994.2
yeah apply to curvature calculated to

2992.69 --> 2996.3
that one good

2994.2 --> 2998.9399999999996
with that it's like everything

2996.3 --> 3002.3590000000004
everything literally is going to have to

2998.94 --> 3007.9
be ups obstructed but it's not can still

3002.359 --> 3007.9
see the beach on the other side right

3015.579 --> 3021.829
right well that's true but it's not it

3019.73 --> 3023.359
but what's happening is as as he's going

3021.829 --> 3025.04
higher or lower if you're going if

3023.359 --> 3026.93
you're starting from low you're looking

3025.04 --> 3028.55
to the most dense part of the atmosphere

3026.93 --> 3030.44
right where the fraction is the highest

3028.55 --> 3033.98
so yeah it makes sense that as he's

3030.44 --> 3037.31
lower the compression is greatest and as

3033.98 --> 3039.68
he rises in elevation the compression

3037.31 --> 3042.109
gets better or lessons because

3039.68 --> 3044.5989999999997
refraction isn't as bad but it's but the

3042.109 --> 3046.16
cause is refraction now there could be

3044.599 --> 3048.829
some something to do with the angle a

3046.16 --> 3050.5699999999997
little bit as well but again even if it

3048.829 --> 3052.3100000000004
is you take you have to take both of

3050.57 --> 3055.94
those things into account to get the

3052.31 --> 3060.5299999999997
full effect a hold on well let me ask

3055.94 --> 3063.319
again like did you mean refraction

3060.53 --> 3067.28
causes obstruction or the mirages in

3063.319 --> 3071.079
effects cause well the Boro the mirages

3067.28 --> 3073.8390000000004
in effect is an obstruction layer of no

3071.079 --> 3076.88
no not really

3073.839 --> 3079.67
the mirages in zone comes after the

3076.88 --> 3081.65
optical slant after the obstruction it

3079.67 --> 3084.44
starts out with the obstruction then the

3081.65 --> 3087.26
mirages in zone basically beyond the

3084.44 --> 3091.01
optical slant points start up as like a

3087.26 --> 3093.619
linear slight a slice that just keeps on

3091.01 --> 3095.4500000000003
linearly growing over distance that

3093.619 --> 3098.54
complete yeah it's a mirror that you

3095.45 --> 3100.609
actually get that's the de mirage it's a

3098.54 --> 3102.95
mirror of the surface right the surface

3100.609 --> 3106.21
because of the angle literally starts to

3102.95 --> 3109.21
reflect everything that's above it I

3106.21 --> 3109.21
believe

3112.69 --> 3122.77
it refraction yeah I guess so it is like

3119.589 --> 3125.38
typical light if you have light on a

3122.77 --> 3127.72
solid object at a certain angle it will

3125.38 --> 3130.42
just absorb and you'll see it and after

3127.72 --> 3132.8799999999997
a while if it becomes steep enough then

3130.42 --> 3137.079
it'll just reflect off like it's a

3132.88 --> 3139.3900000000003
mirror so it is part of optics it is I

3137.079 --> 3142.809
guess in the refraction category of

3139.39 --> 3146.74
effects but I don't think refraction

3142.809 --> 3149.7400000000002
itself explains the obstruction because

3146.74 --> 3154.359
the obstruction is really mostly

3149.74 --> 3156.6699999999996
grounded in my my view at this point big

3154.359 --> 3161.319
yeah due to the perspective and looking

3156.67 --> 3163.569
over is flat surface knowing the limited

3161.319 --> 3167.859
found angle do you know why I would

3163.569 --> 3170.65
disagree though with what because the

3167.859 --> 3172.27
lower part where you say the you know if

3170.65 --> 3173.049
you look at the center line oh and if

3172.27 --> 3175.0
you're trying to say that this

3173.049 --> 3179.71
refraction that's causing the

3175.0 --> 3181.869
compression then when we see globe ism

3179.71 --> 3184.27
we look a building that has no

3181.869 --> 3185.71
compression on it and we can clearly see

3184.27 --> 3187.589
it in the distance

3185.71 --> 3191.4700000000003
the globe is turning around and say that

3187.589 --> 3193.74
that's being refracted or beyond the

3191.47 --> 3196.24
curvature of the earth yeah the Lummi no

3193.74 --> 3200.89
there's no compression on that building

3196.24 --> 3203.6189999999997
right well they suggest it's all looming

3200.89 --> 3206.71
they suggest refraction just displaces

3203.619 --> 3208.96
entire images fastly right that's not

3206.71 --> 3211.42
what the mirages oh no it's just a

3208.96 --> 3214.15
mirage in zone beyond the optical slant

3211.42 --> 3216.789
and within that specific zone things

3214.15 --> 3220.15
warp and they either compress or they

3216.789 --> 3223.1090000000004
stretch or they just mirror and that I

3220.15 --> 3227.2000000000003
guess is dependent on the combination of

3223.109 --> 3235.66
environmental conditions as to what type

3227.2 --> 3237.9399999999996
of me rushing effect manifests yeah as

3235.66 --> 3239.68
far as I'm aware based on like the

3237.94 --> 3244.02
shores presentation

3239.68 --> 3247.1499999999996
is refraction now the ballers we

3244.02 --> 3249.7
refraction the ballers automatic go to

3247.15 --> 3252.94
what you refer to are as looming which

3249.7 --> 3256.2
is coming up the total displacement of

3252.94 --> 3259.92
it all that is how they see looming

3256.2 --> 3262.2999999999997
right but the problem is there's that's

3259.92 --> 3264.4
even if that's real which I don't eat

3262.3 --> 3266.349
that's presupposing you're on fear in

3264.4 --> 3269.4700000000003
the first place we didn't know that

3266.349 --> 3271.349
refraction causes it causes compression

3269.47 --> 3273.79
to the compression effect it causes

3271.349 --> 3275.26
inferior Mirage causes superior Mirage

3273.79 --> 3278.349
and it causes back a magnification

3275.26 --> 3280.21
effect sometimes right so it's all we're

3278.349 --> 3282.1600000000003
from the same cause but it's a different

3280.21 --> 3285.9700000000003
effect and you say well how is that the

3282.16 --> 3288.2799999999997
case the commissions it is it is very

3285.97 --> 3291.339
simple like you have a piece of glass

3288.28 --> 3293.1090000000004
you shine light at it all kinds of

3291.339 --> 3294.97
things can come out of it if you have

3293.109 --> 3296.619
like a block of glass you shoot a light

3294.97 --> 3298.839
right through it it'll go right through

3296.619 --> 3300.9100000000003
it if you shoot it at an angle suddenly

3298.839 --> 3304.0299999999997
it starts to split apart and become like

3300.91 --> 3307.39
a rainbow type a light so yeah

3304.03 --> 3310.4500000000003
refraction the same thing can have all

3307.39 --> 3314.02
kinds of different effects if the angles

3310.45 --> 3316.54
change if the conditions change so yeah

3314.02 --> 3318.91
refraction it's not just a singular

3316.54 --> 3321.45
effect that'll always gonna is always

3318.91 --> 3326.25
gonna roll out of it it can manifest

3321.45 --> 3326.25
different types of effects provably so

3328.109 --> 3334.99
is the single most important point so I

3333.849 --> 3338.369
don't it's a really good presentation

3334.99 --> 3345.49
like I say it's really long but you know

3338.369 --> 3348.13
you have free time link leak me up in

3345.49 --> 3351.339
Skype just in the earlybird chat put out

3348.13 --> 3358.6600000000003
the link to that and I'll I now relayed

3351.339 --> 3360.69
it it's in the hangout chat ok thanks

3358.66 --> 3362.5789999999997
for joining

3360.69 --> 3365.25
yeah the problems here yeah can I just

3362.579 --> 3368.369
say though that when life is short just

3365.25 --> 3371.55
had I think 12 or 13 subscribers I was

3368.369 --> 3373.7400000000002
the guy that found his work and promoted

3371.55 --> 3376.5890000000004
it and you know but everyone over there

3373.74 --> 3379.9199999999996
so I'm really aware of it work yeah I

3376.589 --> 3384.15
don't understand why this guy has less

3379.92 --> 3386.819
subscribers than me for real like that

3384.15 --> 3389.25
guy should have at least for the quality

3386.819 --> 3391.23
of work that he puts out and the the

3389.25 --> 3394.74
level that he reaches in his

3391.23 --> 3397.65
understanding which yeah I admit is even

3394.74 --> 3401.609
beyond my own optical oversight he

3397.65 --> 3404.359
should have thousands of subscribers his

3401.609 --> 3407.97
work is invaluable to us on the long run

3404.359 --> 3410.2799999999997
so yeah yeah well he's doing really well

3407.97 --> 3412.02
now I think he's got at least maybe two

3410.28 --> 3419.849
thousand subscribers all right right

3412.02 --> 3423.599
yeah I'm doing well as well I'm I'm

3419.849 --> 3425.9100000000003
beyond the one two three four so I'm at

3423.599 --> 3427.829
twelve hundred thirty-nine subscribers

3425.91 --> 3429.75
and thank you everyone who has been

3427.829 --> 3433.1090000000004
subscribing in there in the recent

3429.75 --> 3434.88
months and of course every subscriber so

3433.109 --> 3437.67
I'm growing steadily but yeah I don't

3434.88 --> 3443.369
have an expertise like life is short

3437.67 --> 3446.16
Kent yeah I can't do it like that he's

3443.369 --> 3448.05
he's too technical and he really has a

3446.16 --> 3450.5099999999998
good oversight and he think he can

3448.05 --> 3451.5
eventually just literally model it with

3450.51 --> 3455.2200000000003
a computer model

3451.5 --> 3459.06
I think he's gonna grow to that point

3455.22 --> 3464.91
where he can literally like his name

3459.06 --> 3467.49
again I never forgot him the guy that

3464.91 --> 3470.3999999999996
eventually left the flat earthers that I

3467.49 --> 3473.16
was always working with this 3d CGI and

3470.4 --> 3476.579
everything now it's Chris monk like he

3473.16 --> 3478.7999999999997
if he yeah I think that life is short

3476.579 --> 3483.03
could eventually if he has gets his

3478.8 --> 3487.7400000000002
hands on it 3d model his optics concept

3483.03 --> 3490.71
into a real virtual perspective site

3487.74 --> 3492.859
simulator and show us some really

3490.71 --> 3494.719
impressive modeling with that

3492.859 --> 3497.239
I hope he's gonna do that at some point

3494.719 --> 3500.39
that would you have very interesting

3497.239 --> 3503.539
results I don't know if he even plans

3500.39 --> 3504.17
doin well I think he's on the right

3503.539 --> 3508.19
track

3504.17 --> 3509.63
the most I do I agree with him and on

3508.19 --> 3513.289
quite a lot of things the one things we

3509.63 --> 3517.2490000000003
don't tend to agree on are the inferior

3513.289 --> 3520.4300000000003
Mirage and and where that manifests

3517.249 --> 3523.64
itself we have a a disagreement about

3520.43 --> 3525.8289999999997
that but you know I'm sure we'll get a

3523.64 --> 3530.39
get a chance to to work it through and

3525.829 --> 3533.539
right I've got plenty of proofs that it

3530.39 --> 3536.029
doesn't happen where he says well it

3533.539 --> 3539.539
isn't all explained by I mean although

3536.029 --> 3543.349
because his whole concept is the bangles

3539.539 --> 3544.67
and perspective and things like that and

3543.349 --> 3546.579
I think that all the factors that play

3544.67 --> 3549.9990000000003
especially overboard of things that we

3546.579 --> 3553.009
you know we will figure out eventually

3549.999 --> 3556.0989999999997
you can note we can only show what it

3553.009 --> 3559.069
what the effect is and the actual cause

3556.099 --> 3561.6800000000003
of that needs you know a bit more a bit

3559.069 --> 3564.44
more work so obviously when more people

3561.68 --> 3567.499
join Flat Earth people would deeper

3564.44 --> 3571.7290000000003
pocket people with the ability to

3567.499 --> 3574.8489999999997
perhaps take a fleet of boats cross Ave

3571.729 --> 3578.359
for instance and intesity individual

3574.849 --> 3581.6600000000003
weather conditions say one meter above

3578.359 --> 3583.729
the actual sea level at a mile and then

3581.66 --> 3586.0989999999997
the actual weather condition was at two

3583.729 --> 3588.799
miles three miles or miles all at the

3586.099 --> 3591.199
same time and you can demonstrate that

3588.799 --> 3593.089
perhaps maybe they all have the same

3591.199 --> 3595.9300000000003
weather conditions maybe they all have

3593.089 --> 3598.0389999999998
the same humidity the same temperature

3595.93 --> 3600.589
they're all getting the same light

3598.039 --> 3602.63
because obviously if you look up at the

3600.589 --> 3604.519
Sun you'll see that there's clouds go

3602.63 --> 3607.4
over in if you watch over water you'll

3604.519 --> 3610.0389999999998
see a cloud the shadow can be passed

3607.4 --> 3613.099
over the water as it goes across surface

3610.039 --> 3615.17
as the cloud moves so in different

3613.099 --> 3617.3
locations across the stretch of order

3615.17 --> 3620.87
say if the miles the club

3617.3 --> 3624.2000000000003
a tremendous variance of different

3620.87 --> 3625.25
localized conditions in certain areas so

3624.2 --> 3628.64
bigger

3625.25 --> 3630.29
I'm sure experiments will happen but

3628.64 --> 3631.7
right now we don't have the ability to

3630.29 --> 3635.63
do that it's not allowed we can go and

3631.7 --> 3637.8199999999997
hire fifteen volt and have 15 different

3635.63 --> 3640.1600000000003
individual people all taking

3637.82 --> 3643.6400000000003
measurements and right yeah that would

3640.16 --> 3645.41
be way way too complex but there but

3643.64 --> 3647.72
it's possible to do so it is so

3645.41 --> 3649.94
elaborate all these people all having to

3647.72 --> 3651.77
do that for a single thing I think it

3649.94 --> 3654.11
could be approached a little bit easier

3651.77 --> 3656.06
although yeah it's not gonna be as free

3654.11 --> 3660.05
although yeah people traveling is not

3656.06 --> 3663.35
free either so I would suggest try to

3660.05 --> 3666.11
figure out a little system and little

3663.35 --> 3669.11
piece of technology that would not be

3666.11 --> 3674.09
too expensive that can on the spot do

3669.11 --> 3676.4300000000003
measurements take the moisture level

3674.09 --> 3678.7400000000002
take the temperature take the pressure

3676.43 --> 3681.1099999999997
these kind of elements put it in a

3678.74 --> 3683.8999999999996
little system that you can just install

3681.11 --> 3686.84
somewhere or even like put on a buoy and

3683.9 --> 3690.53
that what may be through a built in

3686.84 --> 3692.15
mobile basic transfer system just give

3690.53 --> 3693.6800000000003
out this input you could just have a

3692.15 --> 3695.51
couple of these things I don't know

3693.68 --> 3697.2799999999997
whatever they might just cost like a

3695.51 --> 3700.4
hundred euros or something a hundred

3697.28 --> 3702.4700000000003
pounds each have like ten of these

3700.4 --> 3705.38
things spread around in a certain region

3702.47 --> 3709.91
and you always have all that data

3705.38 --> 3711.71
instantly available now that because you

3709.91 --> 3713.24
don't have to keep on dragging in people

3711.71 --> 3715.25
to do all the measurements you just

3713.24 --> 3719.95
install these things and you can keep on

3715.25 --> 3724.1
using that that would be very useful

3719.95 --> 3728.1499999999996
scientific where are you going to find a

3724.1 --> 3729.47
stretch of water that the local

3728.15 --> 3732.44
governments are going to allow you to

3729.47 --> 3735.1099999999997
install those things you know but you

3732.44 --> 3737.6
don't even necessarily need to tell them

3735.11 --> 3740.1800000000003
you just got to figure out a good spot

3737.6 --> 3742.91
to land a buoy put it there

3740.18 --> 3745.6699999999996
I hope not a boat is gonna drive right

3742.91 --> 3746.8399999999997
over it it's good to plan that out what

3745.67 --> 3749.63
the routes are gonna be and everything

3746.84 --> 3750.86
and just use it and then collect it and

3749.63 --> 3752.78
if a government is going to

3750.86 --> 3755.1200000000003
playin like Oh what is that you just say

3752.78 --> 3757.01
yeah we're just doing some measurements

3755.12 --> 3759.5
we'll take it away again no I don't

3757.01 --> 3761.15
think you really need for me it's not

3759.5 --> 3763.7
like you're gonna install a permanent

3761.15 --> 3768.98
thing there with an anchor to the the

3763.7 --> 3771.7999999999997
sea bottom or anything so yeah is that

3768.98 --> 3774.47
right let's suppose him we look at

3771.8 --> 3777.4700000000003
barrow-in-furness yeah and we're looking

3774.47 --> 3780.56
across at 18 miles to barrow-in-furness

3777.47 --> 3782.3599999999997
well in the globe model whenever i film

3780.56 --> 3784.97
that shore to shore what they're saying

3782.36 --> 3787.82
is that the local conditions across that

3784.97 --> 3791.75
entire stretch are all the same they

3787.82 --> 3793.8500000000004
have to be in order to have the looming

3791.75 --> 3796.79
effect which brings all the buildings in

3793.85 --> 3800.27
this view without any kind of distortion

3796.79 --> 3801.92
because if it were actually looming and

3800.27 --> 3804.2
that's supposing you had half the degree

3801.92 --> 3806.7200000000003
of temperature difference between one

3804.2 --> 3807.7999999999997
area in a different area yeah and what

3806.72 --> 3811.5499999999997
you would have what would happen is that

3807.8 --> 3813.38
a house for instance would be rejected

3811.55 --> 3815.57
in a much higher position next to the

3813.38 --> 3818.03
building next to that it would look odd

3815.57 --> 3820.1000000000004
it would hook it wouldn't look normal

3818.03 --> 3822.0800000000004
you know it would look like the footage

3820.1 --> 3824.81
that Jose took of the rail tracks

3822.08 --> 3827.2999999999997
remember work it all over the place it

3824.81 --> 3829.34
would be will you oblah yeah that's what

3827.3 --> 3832.07
happens when the local conditions are

3829.34 --> 3837.05
different so if you had if used to do a

3832.07 --> 3838.5800000000004
one-off test and used to go down and do

3837.05 --> 3840.7400000000002
those weather conditions over that

3838.58 --> 3843.29
stretch of water I would feel

3840.74 --> 3844.97
confidently you would find that in each

3843.29 --> 3848.84
location there would be a slight

3844.97 --> 3850.73
variance to the other and perhaps from

3848.84 --> 3851.96
the very first at the very last

3850.73 --> 3854.39
there could be a completely different

3851.96 --> 3856.67
set of temperature data because I know

3854.39 --> 3859.1299999999997
for a fact that my friend who lives in

3856.67 --> 3860.9900000000002
Creston which is 20 miles away I can

3859.13 --> 3862.1
follow him up and say you know or you

3860.99 --> 3863.54
come in to Blackpool what's the weather

3862.1 --> 3865.97
like you say that's pissing down there

3863.54 --> 3867.38
mate listen down and it's freezing and

3865.97 --> 3870.47
I'll say well the sun's out here and

3867.38 --> 3872.6600000000003
it's nice you know and that's just a

3870.47 --> 3874.58
20-mile distance so you know it should

3872.66 --> 3875.7799999999997
be no different over water as well you

3874.58 --> 3878.24
know there are the temperature

3875.78 --> 3880.13
differences you know ask your phone you

3878.24 --> 3881.81
know if you know anybody that lives 15

3880.13 --> 3882.82
miles away oh and the more asking what

3881.81 --> 3885.07
the weather's doing

3882.82 --> 3886.9300000000003
probably different what's happening

3885.07 --> 3889.2400000000002
where you are depends on the region

3886.93 --> 3891.94
though it is because England does have a

3889.24 --> 3893.74
lot of hills and mountains then the

3891.94 --> 3896.92
temperature differences can be fast

3893.74 --> 3898.54
because they'll be the different air

3896.92 --> 3901.57
layers with their own temperatures are

3898.54 --> 3903.19
going to be yeah stuck because of the

3901.57 --> 3905.1400000000003
mountains or the hills so they're going

3903.19 --> 3907.03
to be different even in a small stretch

3905.14 --> 3909.04
while for example in the Netherlands

3907.03 --> 3910.57
there's no Hills at all so if there's

3909.04 --> 3913.3
going to be a temperature at the coast

3910.57 --> 3916.09
here in the Netherlands you're going to

3913.3 --> 3918.5800000000004
be pretty damn sure that far landing

3916.09 --> 3921.3700000000003
were just a couple of hundred miles it's

3918.58 --> 3924.94
not gonna deviate much much more than

3921.37 --> 3925.71
one or two degrees max because it's all

3924.94 --> 3932.77
flat

3925.71 --> 3937.48
how big is Netherlands in it small it's

3932.77 --> 3939.91
very small now a little bit more I think

3937.48 --> 3942.76
it's like a hundred by a hundred fifty

3939.91 --> 3947.14
miles roughly I'm not sure I could

3942.76 --> 3954.2200000000003
measure it I could measure well if you

3947.14 --> 3956.3199999999997
got a globe I don't know okay well if

3954.22 --> 3958.6899999999996
you look on any globe and you find the

3956.32 --> 3966.0
Netherlands on a globe it shows it

3958.69 --> 3968.26
curving of course it does how was that

3966.0 --> 3973.54
why can't they make a globe with

3968.26 --> 3980.3700000000003
Netherlands flat because it's pre

3973.54 --> 3983.73
supposed to be on a globe yeah of course

3980.37 --> 3983.73
let's see

3984.369 --> 4000.029
can I measure the length of it I think I

3994.22 --> 4000.029
was about right ten hold on let me see

4002.0 --> 4008.96
yes laughter yes it's quite the school

4006.14 --> 4014.0899999999997
quite the school I can it's a hundred

4008.96 --> 4015.95
miles across and in yeah okay so it's a

4014.09 --> 4022.03
hundred miles not a hundred kilometres

4015.95 --> 4024.8489999999997
hundred miles across on the longitude or

4022.03 --> 4027.349
horizontal doesn't make any sense but

4024.849 --> 4029.3300000000004
from east to west it's a hundred miles

4027.349 --> 4033.05
and from north to south yeah there's a

4029.33 --> 4039.2
couple of pieces that stick out so it's

4033.05 --> 4043.34
roughly 150 miles from north to south so

4039.2 --> 4045.23
yeah that's the Netherlands essentially

4043.34 --> 4049.79
it should just have a flat square

4045.23 --> 4054.109
shouldn't it shouldn't have them it

4049.79 --> 4057.92
doesn't it's perfectly flat it's

4054.109 --> 4061.22
literally a lot of the Netherlands is

4057.92 --> 4064.2200000000003
basically dried up see button they diked

4061.22 --> 4070.609
it in and they just so drained the water

4064.22 --> 4071.99
and yeah it's gonna be sea level flat so

4070.609 --> 4074.44
yeah most of the Netherlands is sea

4071.99 --> 4077.5099999999998
level flat except for a bit of the

4074.44 --> 4082.31
southeast parts which border more

4077.51 --> 4084.4700000000003
hellish territory but most of the nails

4082.31 --> 4089.5099999999998
just completely flat it's all Riverland

4084.47 --> 4093.47
and diked in oceans lay dry so it's all

4089.51 --> 4095.4500000000003
flat all of it you never really see a

4093.47 --> 4099.219
hill or a mountain in the Netherlands

4095.45 --> 4099.219
except if you go south Oh

4101.88 --> 4116.18
I think you're breaking up still there

4112.46 --> 4118.8
yeah yeah I think my internet connection

4116.18 --> 4122.16
broke for a moment the stream is still

4118.8 --> 4127.2
going though so yeah what do you see

4122.16 --> 4130.29
where did you get funding for not a

4127.2 --> 4132.0599999999995
separate fund I'm still kind of saving

4130.29 --> 4139.859
up for that but I did get a microphone

4132.06 --> 4144.240000000001
you did see that right yeah yeah you and

4139.859 --> 4147.240000000001
some others together combined yeah me

4144.24 --> 4147.66
allowed me to get this very happy about

4147.24 --> 4151.07
it

4147.66 --> 4154.139999999999
sound is a lot less noisy these days

4151.07 --> 4160.23
yeah Annoying crackle in the background

4154.14 --> 4163.9400000000005
I still yeah I think I think today's the

4160.23 --> 4167.549999999999
day that nathan has another baby yeah

4163.94 --> 4170.009999999999
yeah he's he's not live-streaming at

4167.55 --> 4171.63
least he is he just put out another

4170.01 --> 4175.17
premiere so I think he's not gonna be

4171.63 --> 4177.3
live-streaming I'm very curious to see a

4175.17 --> 4179.43
report he's probably just gonna do it

4177.3 --> 4181.26
like a short clip or something like hey

4179.43 --> 4186.900000000001
I got a baby in the evening that's what

4181.26 --> 4190.26
I expect but we'll see very curious yeah

4186.9 --> 4197.429999999999
Angelus I guess you gotta a woman's

4190.26 --> 4202.83
first can't make babies on your own good

4197.43 --> 4204.39
for him man keep it up I believe it's

4202.83 --> 4208.88
not the little girl as well yeah it is

4204.39 --> 4208.88
yeah it's gonna be your ladies man oh

4209.27 --> 4218.64
man I and I'm gonna be laughing so hard

4213.9 --> 4222.0
at him like in 10 to 15 years

4218.64 --> 4224.46
cuz now he's like a loud guy and he's

4222.0 --> 4225.57
like king of the hangout well in 12

4224.46 --> 4229.65
years or so

4225.57 --> 4232.219999999999
those girls are going to be teenagers so

4229.65 --> 4232.219999999999
good luck with that

4234.05 --> 4240.54
that's gonna be interesting

4237.47 --> 4243.54
does anybody know when slice par Kane's

4240.54 --> 4245.55
doing his his experiment I said it was

4243.54 --> 4248.73
gonna be in a few days that was at least

4245.55 --> 4250.860000000001
two days ago so anybody got any idea

4248.73 --> 4253.29
when that's actually taking place in the

4250.86 --> 4256.5199999999995
side chat because wouldn't mind watching

4253.29 --> 4260.16
that especially if he doesn't live I

4256.52 --> 4263.52
have no idea I don't follow slice for

4260.16 --> 4267.24
Kane at all no I think he set himself up

4263.52 --> 4269.9400000000005
to fail more than anything I mean he so

4267.24 --> 4273.36
much work that actually has to go into

4269.94 --> 4274.799999999999
actually just build in the construction

4273.36 --> 4278.19
that he's trained to actually build

4274.8 --> 4280.29
I mean if it's if he's got help you'd

4278.19 --> 4282.48
probably need at least half a dozen

4280.29 --> 4284.13
people to help how to actually do it if

4282.48 --> 4285.209999999999
he's doing it on his own which is what I

4284.13 --> 4287.22
have heard that he's going to be doing

4285.21 --> 4290.28
on his own and trying to accomplish this

4287.22 --> 4294.150000000001
in one day he hasn't got a chance of

4290.28 --> 4297.3
doing that hmm why did you say he was

4294.15 --> 4301.139999999999
gonna plan to do exactly he's bought a

4297.3 --> 4306.96
bunch of pipe in and on the water pump

4301.14 --> 4309.06
and you know some connections like like

4306.96 --> 4311.1
holes like holes connection holes crack

4309.06 --> 4312.6
connection and he's gonna stick all

4311.1 --> 4314.52
these sticks in the ground and he's are

4312.6 --> 4316.950000000001
going to be pumping water through them I

4314.52 --> 4320.160000000001
mean over a stretch of three-quarters of

4316.95 --> 4322.29
a mile and it's like the guy doesn't it

4320.16 --> 4325.139999999999
can't be for my way you can accomplish

4322.29 --> 4327.87
this only God alright is he turned on

4325.14 --> 4332.58
apply' tried to prove that water curves

4327.87 --> 4334.5
or something you'd have to watch all the

4332.58 --> 4337.58
stuff that he's doing essentially what

4334.5 --> 4339.69
it's trying to measure is a two inch

4337.58 --> 4342.36
discrepancy over three-quarters of a

4339.69 --> 4346.589999999999
mile right so he is trying to prove that

4342.36 --> 4349.17
water is not stret straight yeah and I

4346.59 --> 4353.24
don't think that I don't think that the

4349.17 --> 4357.6900000000005
technology that he has which is a t-1000

4353.24 --> 4361.8
is gonna be I've got enough camera to

4357.69 --> 4363.15
detect that two inches of curvature and

4361.8 --> 4365.67
even if he did

4363.15 --> 4368.79
it would be open to question because it

4365.67 --> 4370.77
is such a small amount it's it really

4368.79 --> 4372.57
it's so close to being nothing two

4370.77 --> 4374.1
inches is essentially over

4372.57 --> 4377.759999999999
three-quarters of a mile I don't know

4374.1 --> 4380.64
how I can get a result well if he is

4377.76 --> 4384.3
sneaky then he could always still just

4380.64 --> 4386.159000000001
get the camera put it over that stretch

4384.3 --> 4389.01
the water stretching and look oh look

4386.159 --> 4390.659
there's obstruction see it's curving

4389.01 --> 4392.7300000000005
because there's obstruction because I'm

4390.659 --> 4395.009999999999
low enough to it you might pull

4392.73 --> 4397.98
something off like that yeah I mean he

4395.01 --> 4399.9890000000005
only has to push a stick in a fraction

4397.98 --> 4403.23
harder than it needs to be you know to

4399.989 --> 4404.73
get the right result or whatever look

4403.23 --> 4407.428999999999
I'm not saying that he's good think of

4404.73 --> 4409.08
that I'm just saying that in my opinion

4407.429 --> 4411.63
if it done it over a three mile stretch

4409.08 --> 4414.69
instead of 3/4 of a mile he would have a

4411.63 --> 4416.429
definitive result because then you're

4414.69 --> 4419.58
going to be looking at perhaps a two

4416.429 --> 4422.64
foot drop from the center at center

4419.58 --> 4424.08
point six will be over the whole lot

4422.64 --> 4425.4890000000005
obviously but what he's trying to

4424.08 --> 4428.19
measure would only be a couple of feet

4425.489 --> 4432.389999999999
what that would be you'd be able to

4428.19 --> 4434.669999999999
distinguish that no yeah - food is a lot

4432.39 --> 4439.2300000000005
that would definitely move a lot of the

4434.67 --> 4441.54
water to the sides yes take I am okay I

4439.23 --> 4444.178999999999
do look sad that's cuz I've got two

4441.54 --> 4449.73
sheep rat [ __ ] mate thank you thanks

4444.179 --> 4451.14
for asking so yeah ranty awesome thank

4449.73 --> 4453.57
you for coming I'm gonna round out the

4451.14 --> 4458.070000000001
show of been going for one hour 30

4453.57 --> 4459.48
minutes and a break so thank you thank

4458.07 --> 4462.2699999999995
you for coming on the panels good to

4459.48 --> 4466.709999999999
talk good to get an update on your

4462.27 --> 4469.56
situation and talk about well what

4466.71 --> 4472.17
you're planning to do in the near future

4469.56 --> 4475.64
with your channel and I can't wait to

4472.17 --> 4482.79
yet to see you try out some new things

4475.64 --> 4485.58
so keep me keep me posted and do

4482.79 --> 4488.73
subscribe to Randy's patreon everyone do

4485.58 --> 4490.8
it he doesn't like it but you got to do

4488.73 --> 4494.159
it anyway you know what you can troll

4490.8 --> 4496.979
him give him a lot of money you'll be so

4494.159 --> 4498.719
embarrassed it's going to be terrible
