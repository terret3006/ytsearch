140.48 --> 145.35999999999999
of september 2020

145.76 --> 149.2
yeah i saw good servant you shared the

148.0 --> 152.959
links

149.2 --> 152.95899999999997
so let's hope other people get in as

154.84 --> 157.84
well

158.879 --> 174.72
it's awesome

171.28 --> 176.64000000000001
what tenth man was in my early bird chat

174.72 --> 178.48
i didn't even know that apparently jaron

176.64 --> 185.83999999999997
isn't left

178.48 --> 185.84
i didn't was he in there i guess so hmm

189.92 --> 198.95899999999997
wow okay hey hello adam meekin

194.48 --> 202.64
martin tolberg yoko mikolo

198.959 --> 204.159
mokito like i don't know is that

202.64 --> 205.83999999999997
are you trying to get banned or

204.159 --> 209.519
something

205.84 --> 209.519
because you know that's just really

210.84 --> 213.84
annoying

214.48 --> 219.76
all right anyway yeah we were talking on

217.2 --> 222.07999999999998
24 7.

219.76 --> 224.0
last part about gravity it was

222.08 --> 224.959
fascinating because this new guy i

224.0 --> 228.08
didn't know him

224.959 --> 228.08
brought forth that some

228.879 --> 236.159
scientists in in arabia somewhere

232.959 --> 237.12
basically came out that gravity isn't

236.159 --> 239.12
real and that

237.12 --> 240.959
that's not mass attracted by a mass and

239.12 --> 242.4
it was a good conversation again in all

240.959 --> 245.519
the details

242.4 --> 247.519
put down my knowledge about that

245.519 --> 248.72
and it's it was very good being with

247.519 --> 252.87900000000002
nathan there

248.72 --> 255.439
too in the panel that guy is awesome

252.879 --> 256.56
and before that we had this very long

255.439 --> 259.04
bit tedious

256.56 --> 260.16
but still doable conversation with this

259.04 --> 264.639
guy that just

260.16 --> 266.56
had mental issues self-proclaimed any

264.639 --> 268.8
like depression and he was constantly

266.56 --> 271.36
just hanging on to that

268.8 --> 272.639
and nathan knows how to deal with it i

271.36 --> 274.72
know how to deal with it

272.639 --> 276.0
and we were like really trying to get

274.72 --> 276.96000000000004
through to him but he was like

276.0 --> 279.12
constantly

276.96 --> 280.15999999999997
resorting back to no i can't do that no

279.12 --> 283.759
i can do that

280.16 --> 285.6
sounds very familiar to me personally

283.759 --> 288.40000000000003
because i kind of struggle with that

285.6 --> 288.40000000000003
tendency

288.479 --> 294.639
to basically negate a solution

291.84 --> 297.59999999999997
when it's presented so but yeah it was

294.639 --> 300.8
still a good conversation

297.6 --> 311.84000000000003
ah right did i make any notes

300.8 --> 311.84000000000003
i barely did

321.28 --> 326.32
right but anyway yesterday flatters

323.68 --> 329.36
debate was pretty good

326.32 --> 329.36
very active show

333.12 --> 335.759
was it again

337.36 --> 341.039
adam you were there what was it about

350.84 --> 356.56
again

353.039 --> 358.4
you didn't saw a long distance photos on

356.56 --> 362.08
the channel yeah that's right

358.4 --> 364.84
i haven't really made any because

362.08 --> 366.71999999999997
technically i haven't been out of the

364.84 --> 369.67999999999995
city

366.72 --> 370.47900000000004
not a really anyway yeah one time but

369.68 --> 374.479
just in

370.479 --> 377.12
the car to do something else so yeah i

374.479 --> 379.039
haven't been to the coast or anything

377.12 --> 382.639
that's right

379.039 --> 383.919
haven't gotten to it and i technically

382.639 --> 388.24
at this point don't

383.919 --> 388.24
plan to i got other priorities

388.319 --> 395.84000000000003
oh you weren't yesterday okay hey roger

396.319 --> 402.40000000000003
hmm almost again we're just talking

399.68 --> 402.40000000000003
about fed

406.56 --> 411.44
that's weird i forgot man but it was a

408.88 --> 411.44
good show

412.4 --> 420.84
very active no ballers

416.4 --> 422.23999999999995
that i can remember were there or maybe

420.84 --> 424.08
uh that

422.24 --> 425.52
the typical guy that's been hanging

424.08 --> 429.52
around recently the baller

425.52 --> 433.599
what's his name again pickle rick

429.52 --> 436.71999999999997
you might have yeah yeah we had him

433.599 --> 439.12
for a short moment that's right

436.72 --> 439.12
anyway

440.479 --> 444.08
right thursday it was when they did epic

443.68 --> 447.44
first

444.08 --> 447.44
question for the whole show

448.479 --> 454.479
that was thursday i think yesterday was

451.28 --> 454.479
kind of like that as well

455.28 --> 458.79999999999995
i remember because the first show kind

457.599 --> 462.15999999999997
of ended up

458.8 --> 465.919
on the second question i think

462.16 --> 467.12
an earth spin and then the after show

465.919 --> 471.68
went on for another

467.12 --> 473.599
hour which was also very good

471.68 --> 475.039
anyway yeah excellent shows on flutters

473.599 --> 478.87899999999996
debate so i'm definitely gonna watch

475.039 --> 483.28
that on sunday

478.879 --> 483.28000000000003
but bubby and tangents yeah yeah

487.759 --> 494.40000000000003
right also uh oh yeah remember

491.68 --> 496.16
iron media in the evening i actually

494.4 --> 499.35999999999996
yeah i actually

496.16 --> 503.44
hang in there hung in there

499.36 --> 503.44
to the end like until three at night

504.0 --> 508.24
shouldn't do that this is weird man when

506.319 --> 510.879
i go to bed this late i can literally i

508.24 --> 513.039
start to feel it

510.879 --> 516.88
in i don't know how that works but i

513.039 --> 516.88
start to like physically feel it

517.36 --> 524.24
in it's not in the bones but in like the

521.2 --> 524.8000000000001
the not the bones not the muscle but

524.24 --> 527.44
like

524.8 --> 528.4799999999999
the tissue that how do you call that in

527.44 --> 531.12
english

528.48 --> 531.12
[ __ ] sake

532.48 --> 540.16
let me google it

535.0 --> 541.839
[Music]

540.16 --> 543.6
yeah connective tissue oh great it's

541.839 --> 546.08
just connective tissue okay

543.6 --> 549.839
right that start to feel it there i

546.08 --> 549.839
don't know why

551.519 --> 556.24
yeah it was a lot of fun in the show and

554.32 --> 558.08
it was active in chat most of the time

556.24 --> 559.76
you know not all of it

558.08 --> 561.519
i was also doing other stuff at the same

559.76 --> 565.2
time oh yeah i took a shower

561.519 --> 565.2
so my hair is all fluffy now

566.08 --> 577.839
yeah right

578.32 --> 582.0
yeah i didn't really watch anything i

580.32 --> 584.88
tried to look around but i couldn't find

582.0 --> 584.88
anything interesting

589.2 --> 593.0400000000001
tangents can be bent yeah

597.44 --> 602.0
well in geometry tangents to measure

600.72 --> 605.839
things cannot be bent

602.0 --> 605.839
that is for sure

611.68 --> 619.8389999999999
anyway uh let's see what else was it to

616.839 --> 619.839
win

621.04 --> 624.14
[Music]

629.6 --> 633.76
from iron realm media russia

635.76 --> 647.8389999999999
i'll get you anything

651.6 --> 656.0
i've been getting more control comments

657.12 --> 661.519
oh yeah i also heard apparently that on

659.76 --> 665.04
the iron realm

661.519 --> 668.399
that the morning show was removed

665.04 --> 671.4399999999999
like why is it because you guys were

668.399 --> 671.44
swearing or something

672.16 --> 677.04
i don't understand like why how that

674.48 --> 680.16
works with iron realm

677.04 --> 681.4399999999999
like how they get removed i don't i

680.16 --> 684.24
never get removed

681.44 --> 686.6400000000001
i get demon like my episode gets

684.24 --> 689.839
demonetized at best

686.64 --> 691.8389999999999
or at worst so i don't really understand

689.839 --> 694.6400000000001
even why other channels

691.839 --> 696.399
have these issues sometimes like how how

694.64 --> 698.8
is that happening

696.399 --> 700.8
when hey i i say plenty of swear words i

698.8 --> 703.5999999999999
get really pissed off sometimes i go

700.8 --> 707.4399999999999
overboard a little sometimes

703.6 --> 710.32
never really any oh copyright crap

707.44 --> 711.9200000000001
oh right because one guy was playing a

710.32 --> 717.839
song himself right

711.92 --> 717.8389999999999
it's absolutely ridiculous

723.68 --> 726.88
yeah that's just weird

728.0 --> 732.399
just on the other hand you could also

730.079 --> 735.519
consider it as a compliment that

732.399 --> 738.8
he played it so accurately so well

735.519 --> 744.72
that the ai actually recognized it as an

738.8 --> 759.8389999999999
original copy this is

744.72 --> 759.839
yeah but still annoying as [ __ ]

783.36 --> 790.0790000000001
all right

787.519 --> 791.04
oh yeah oh by the way interesting

790.079 --> 792.88
factoids

791.04 --> 794.7199999999999
is it interesting i don't know i'm just

792.88 --> 796.639
gonna say it anyway but yesterday's show

794.72 --> 800.399
apparently

796.639 --> 803.6
didn't get devoted

800.399 --> 805.76
let's check it out it's still just as as

803.6 --> 809.12
we left it

805.76 --> 815.8389999999999
hasn't been devoted at all still

809.12 --> 815.839
10 upvotes in there

817.519 --> 822.72
check it out well

823.04 --> 827.4399999999999
the other show which one is it

827.68 --> 830.399
49

830.88 --> 834.24
yeah that's that one still has zero up

833.519 --> 836.639
votes

834.24 --> 836.639
really

837.6 --> 843.839
check this out makes a lot of sense

847.44 --> 851.7600000000001
i'm wondering now is somebody like

849.04 --> 853.8389999999999
trying to morse code me or something

851.76 --> 857.8389999999999
with

853.839 --> 861.1990000000001
with putting the votes to zero

857.839 --> 864.32
i just sounds kind of silly

861.199 --> 866.16
like why why some episodes they just

864.32 --> 867.7600000000001
don't touch and the other ones

866.16 --> 870.48
even the ones that don't have a title

867.76 --> 885.8389999999999
they just screw it down to zero

870.48 --> 885.839
upvotes which is weird

890.88 --> 899.8389999999999
well i see today uh i already have -14

894.8 --> 899.8389999999999
special very special

901.279 --> 905.68
i got more no i don't know wait

906.24 --> 910.0
yeah i got a little bit more viewers

907.76 --> 910.8
than i had downvotes but it's all it was

910.0 --> 914.32
almost for

910.8 --> 917.3599999999999
for a few moments like there were

914.32 --> 927.839
more votes than there were viewers

917.36 --> 927.839
it's very unlikely in reality

938.16 --> 955.8389999999999
yeah martin toborg i know it really does

941.04 --> 955.8389999999999
seem like youtube is trolling me

965.6 --> 971.0400000000001
right so let's not get too long asylum

968.48 --> 974.0790000000001
pauses that's just annoying

971.04 --> 975.759
uh right so it's saturday pretty much

974.079 --> 977.199
open i don't think there's ball busters

975.759 --> 980.0
live because there was

977.199 --> 981.12
last week didn't see any special

980.0 --> 985.04
announcements from

981.12 --> 987.199
qe so anything anyone likes to talk

985.04 --> 990.079
about

987.199 --> 991.04
please don't make it about art arthritis

990.079 --> 994.0
and

991.04 --> 997.8389999999999
and all that again already treated

994.0 --> 1000.8
pretty much the entire episode yesterday

997.839 --> 1000.8000000000001
we talked about that

1005.759 --> 1011.839
but yeah no specific subjects are

1008.0 --> 1011.839
popping to mind at this very moment

1016.48 --> 1022.639
right oh wait yeah a little detail maybe

1020.48 --> 1024.559
yeah i found out recently that

1022.639 --> 1028.24
apparently my dnd group has

1024.559 --> 1030.959
kind of like stopped they said like

1028.24 --> 1033.199
they're not yeah they're not gonna try

1030.959 --> 1037.76
to plan a show anymore

1033.199 --> 1041.52
apparently which is really sad to me

1037.76 --> 1041.52
topic rapture oh please no

1043.4 --> 1046.519
[Music]

1048.16 --> 1052.0
but yeah that's a little sad because it

1051.679 --> 1055.2800000000002
was

1052.0 --> 1057.919
a really good campaign

1055.28 --> 1058.72
and the only problems that i had with it

1057.919 --> 1061.039
and hey i

1058.72 --> 1062.32
miss talking about i really miss talking

1061.039 --> 1065.44
about dnd

1062.32 --> 1068.32
i miss it now maybe

1065.44 --> 1070.88
a lot of you aren't missing it i am

1068.32 --> 1074.559
because i like dnd

1070.88 --> 1076.96
find it very

1074.559 --> 1077.76
yeah i get get a lot of room to think

1076.96 --> 1080.0
and just

1077.76 --> 1081.679
be have constructive thinking and

1080.0 --> 1084.32
analyzing and

1081.679 --> 1085.8400000000001
so i like it but yeah they basically

1084.32 --> 1088.48
kind of quit on me

1085.84 --> 1089.6789999999999
although they said yeah we might like

1088.48 --> 1092.08
get to back together

1089.679 --> 1094.799
again at some point but for now yeah

1092.08 --> 1096.48
they're just kind of stopping

1094.799 --> 1097.84
especially because one of the players

1096.48 --> 1101.6
like is now

1097.84 --> 1103.9189999999999
living like

1101.6 --> 1106.0
not too far away but far away enough

1103.919 --> 1109.2
that it's become too much of a hassle

1106.0 --> 1113.36
for them by their own words

1109.2 --> 1113.3600000000001
i don't know and

1113.919 --> 1117.6000000000001
yeah it's kind of a waste because

1117.76 --> 1122.32
in the game with everything that was

1120.08 --> 1125.9189999999999
already set out they were just at two

1122.32 --> 1126.3999999999999
thirds and with room to yeah to make

1125.919 --> 1128.7990000000002
that

1126.4 --> 1130.5590000000002
at one third because i had a lot more

1128.799 --> 1133.6
options lying on the table

1130.559 --> 1133.6
and it's really

1134.08 --> 1138.0
it's such a waste i really wish i could

1136.32 --> 1141.52
just get a freaking

1138.0 --> 1143.679
group of programmers art directors

1141.52 --> 1145.6
and musicians to get and just say okay

1143.679 --> 1147.76
let's just make this into an

1145.6 --> 1149.76
amazing freaking computer game i'll plan

1147.76 --> 1151.919
it all out it'll be the best thing since

1149.76 --> 1154.48
baller's gate

1151.919 --> 1156.0800000000002
and it'll be not a freaking first person

1154.48 --> 1158.32
game how about that

1156.08 --> 1159.12
let's just not do that let's just skip

1158.32 --> 1161.9189999999999
that entire

1159.12 --> 1163.6789999999999
[ __ ] get it all out of the way make it

1161.919 --> 1164.0800000000002
old-fashioned again and just make it

1163.679 --> 1166.799
really

1164.08 --> 1168.6399999999999
good make it beautiful make the music

1166.799 --> 1172.16
excellent make the story

1168.64 --> 1174.0800000000002
great make the characters fascinating

1172.16 --> 1176.0
and deeper than most people are even

1174.08 --> 1176.6399999999999
used to let's not dumb it down let's

1176.0 --> 1179.679
make this

1176.64 --> 1182.72
glorious i can with just what i've

1179.679 --> 1184.0
what already been done and hey i got

1182.72 --> 1188.0
like over a hundred

1184.0 --> 1190.32
pages of reports of details

1188.0 --> 1191.52
i can use all of that and i even asked

1190.32 --> 1194.0
the gamers

1191.52 --> 1195.6
of my group like is it okay if i like

1194.0 --> 1197.76
write a book or make a computer game

1195.6 --> 1199.36
with this like do i get the rights for

1197.76 --> 1201.44
these characters that

1199.36 --> 1203.36
you guys are taking very serious making

1201.44 --> 1204.64
them yourselves based after your own

1203.36 --> 1207.6789999999999
ideas

1204.64 --> 1211.2800000000002
and me working with that can i take them

1207.679 --> 1211.8400000000001
for my like can i have copyrights as it

1211.28 --> 1215.2
were and

1211.84 --> 1216.0
yeah they they did because it was very

1215.2 --> 1220.159
early with that

1216.0 --> 1221.84
before it became extremely awesome

1220.159 --> 1223.8400000000001
and they don't really care that much

1221.84 --> 1227.52
anyway i always like

1223.84 --> 1227.52
associate the character with the person

1227.76 --> 1231.2
like i imagine that if i had a computer

1230.799 --> 1233.6
game

1231.2 --> 1235.039
i'm gonna make their characters like

1233.6 --> 1236.7199999999998
standard npc

1235.039 --> 1238.4
that can be part of the party that have

1236.72 --> 1240.24
stories

1238.4 --> 1241.6000000000001
connected to them very elaborately and

1240.24 --> 1243.36
in their conversations

1241.6 --> 1245.12
just like baldur's gate because it was

1243.36 --> 1249.84
one of those things that made that game

1245.12 --> 1253.12
awesome and

1249.84 --> 1254.08
yeah i can i know i can do it i know i

1253.12 --> 1257.12
have a great

1254.08 --> 1262.72
world setting and campaign with just a

1257.12 --> 1266.1589999999999
lot of options but yeah

1262.72 --> 1266.159
i can't do it by myself

1268.159 --> 1274.0800000000002
i don't really know how to start such

1271.52 --> 1275.2
things up i'd like how do you actually

1274.08 --> 1277.6789999999999
build

1275.2 --> 1280.48
build it and how do you work in a team

1277.679 --> 1284.5590000000002
like that part especially i don't know

1280.48 --> 1286.64
how to lead a team i wish i did

1284.559 --> 1289.36
i didn't get a lot of opportunities like

1286.64 --> 1292.5590000000002
they didn't really pick me to do that

1289.36 --> 1295.6
because i wasn't radiating a lot of

1292.559 --> 1295.6
confidence back then

1302.24 --> 1305.44
not online d d

1306.88 --> 1311.2800000000002
it's dungeons and dragons table top role

1309.84 --> 1314.48
playing game with paper

1311.28 --> 1316.08
dice and a lot of words sometimes

1314.48 --> 1321.1200000000001
pictures

1316.08 --> 1321.12
scenery music picked from other things

1323.52 --> 1329.9189999999999
but yeah you can also turn that into an

1326.72 --> 1331.76
actual game a computer game like

1329.919 --> 1347.8400000000001
bowler's gate

1331.76 --> 1347.84
in that setting in that style

1349.039 --> 1355.919
sell it to developer yeah no

1352.96 --> 1355.919
that's ridiculous

1356.799 --> 1364.1589999999999
no now these i have a world

1361.2 --> 1365.28
and it literally develops on the spot so

1364.159 --> 1368.7990000000002
i i can't just

1365.28 --> 1371.6
write down a script and then sell it

1368.799 --> 1374.0
i'm not gonna get anything for that and

1371.6 --> 1376.08
i'm not gonna have any creative

1374.0 --> 1378.32
resolve in that it's just going to be a

1376.08 --> 1380.8799999999999
corporation

1378.32 --> 1382.72
style game using a generic story that

1380.88 --> 1384.72
you will barely recognize anymore it's

1382.72 --> 1386.72
just going to be same old same old

1384.72 --> 1389.28
[ __ ] to get as much profit as you like

1386.72 --> 1393.28
no no if i'm gonna have a game made

1389.28 --> 1395.28
i will be in there i will be bothering

1393.28 --> 1397.6789999999999
these people constantly

1395.28 --> 1398.559
about details and about ideas and

1397.679 --> 1401.8400000000001
talking with them

1398.559 --> 1402.48
a lot to get their their mind set on

1401.84 --> 1406.1589999999999
what

1402.48 --> 1406.64
it is actually what it is they're trying

1406.159 --> 1409.2
to

1406.64 --> 1409.2
encode

1413.6 --> 1418.48
i don't code anything all right uh still

1416.96 --> 1420.4
monkey 3d

1418.48 --> 1423.3600000000001
yeah hobby coding yeah yeah i've known

1420.4 --> 1423.3600000000001
some people like that

1423.44 --> 1427.279
every programmer i've ever known they

1425.919 --> 1432.159
never have time for

1427.279 --> 1434.32
anything especially coding

1432.159 --> 1434.3200000000002
so

1440.88 --> 1444.24
but yeah the coding is not the only

1442.799 --> 1447.679
thing i need i

1444.24 --> 1451.1200000000001
also just need a developing team

1447.679 --> 1452.799
i need people that can make beautiful

1451.12 --> 1454.4799999999998
graphics i need

1452.799 --> 1455.9189999999999
people that can compose freaking

1454.48 --> 1457.84
classical music

1455.919 --> 1459.76
to my standards because i'm not going to

1457.84 --> 1462.08
have some shitty standard subpar

1459.76 --> 1463.36
music in my game absolutely not what

1462.08 --> 1467.6789999999999
made baldur's gate so

1463.36 --> 1470.7199999999998
amazing was the music above all things

1467.679 --> 1473.919
in my opinion and and how well it was

1470.72 --> 1476.799
integrated with the story the music was

1473.919 --> 1479.039
the story and i want something like that

1476.799 --> 1482.0
it's going to be critical

1479.039 --> 1483.52
i would put probably half my budget into

1482.0 --> 1487.039
music

1483.52 --> 1489.84
in my idea i don't know in practice how

1487.039 --> 1489.84
that works at all

1492.24 --> 1495.679
that is art you're talking about yeah

1493.84 --> 1498.1589999999999
well that's a game

1495.679 --> 1499.279
you know not all look that's the whole

1498.159 --> 1500.72
point

1499.279 --> 1502.559
if you're gonna be like oh we have

1500.72 --> 1504.48
another 3d game now we need the

1502.559 --> 1506.3999999999999
programmers to get the models and all

1504.48 --> 1509.52
the flaws and

1506.4 --> 1512.64
does it all work and no bugs

1509.52 --> 1515.44
oh get the bugs out for like years

1512.64 --> 1518.24
yay that's just freaking great no no

1515.44 --> 1521.3600000000001
baldrige gate won't require that

1518.24 --> 1528.0
it's very simple

1521.36 --> 1532.0
the baldur's gate is an art game it is

1528.0 --> 1532.0
very simple how it works

1533.36 --> 1541.6
it's basically a late 90s game

1538.0 --> 1544.88
that was just technically kind of at its

1541.6 --> 1547.84
end phase in a way because

1544.88 --> 1548.72
3d first person was all that the rage

1547.84 --> 1552.24
and it was

1548.72 --> 1555.279
still pre it was before that

1552.24 --> 1558.4
90s game but then they basically

1555.279 --> 1561.52
used that formula and filled

1558.4 --> 1565.44
like pure gold put it in there made it

1561.52 --> 1568.8799999999999
really great by pure artistry

1565.44 --> 1571.76
and and dream and music and

1568.88 --> 1572.24
that's how i want to make a game no one

1571.76 --> 1574.85
has some

1572.24 --> 1575.919
technical oh this is super cool

1574.85 --> 1578.799
[Music]

1575.919 --> 1579.679
3d and shoot here and oh it looks so

1578.799 --> 1584.08
awesome

1579.679 --> 1588.0800000000002
action scene no no no

1584.08 --> 1591.4399999999998
music scenery

1588.08 --> 1594.48
and story voice acting that's the thing

1591.44 --> 1596.96
that i think is important in the game

1594.48 --> 1597.52
you know a real good computer game to me

1596.96 --> 1601.1200000000001
is like

1597.52 --> 1613.84
reading a book that literally moves

1601.12 --> 1613.84
and speaks that's a good game to me

1617.76 --> 1622.8799999999999
and i'm not the only one that thinks

1620.0 --> 1625.2
like this by the way because there's

1622.88 --> 1626.0
there are some really beautiful games

1625.2 --> 1628.4
out there even

1626.0 --> 1630.48
modern ones but yeah they become

1628.4 --> 1632.159
increasingly harder to find

1630.48 --> 1633.919
and they get snowed under on their

1632.159 --> 1637.679
corporate

1633.919 --> 1640.24
zombie games like statin pre

1637.679 --> 1644.0800000000002
fab [ __ ] that's fat flashing everyone's

1640.24 --> 1644.08
face and you get bored with it really

1652.84 --> 1658.799
quickly

1654.88 --> 1659.44
but yeah i still want to do something

1658.799 --> 1663.279
like that

1659.44 --> 1663.279
i just don't really know where to begin

1664.32 --> 1669.84
i can just work out the story work out

1666.72 --> 1669.84
the maps

1670.24 --> 1673.52
do like especially like structural

1672.48 --> 1676.88
planning like

1673.52 --> 1680.96
flow chart planning okay

1676.88 --> 1681.6000000000001
this scene like this scene like they

1680.96 --> 1684.24
arrive

1681.6 --> 1685.6789999999999
what is going to be the setting and then

1684.24 --> 1688.08
what has to happen

1685.679 --> 1688.96
how would that work in order for the

1688.08 --> 1692.6399999999999
next

1688.96 --> 1694.72
scene to to arrive changing how

1692.64 --> 1697.3600000000001
everything works basically taking the

1694.72 --> 1699.52
next map and how do you connect it in

1697.36 --> 1701.039
all like these mechanics that's

1699.52 --> 1702.32
something that i have a lot on my

1701.039 --> 1704.24
attention

1702.32 --> 1706.24
i would probably take control of that

1704.24 --> 1708.0
because it is

1706.24 --> 1711.84
a piece of programming but it's not

1708.0 --> 1711.84
literally the coding it's literally

1712.88 --> 1719.0390000000002
connecting the dots tying in the strings

1716.08 --> 1720.72
once the structure for the program is

1719.039 --> 1724.0
there once

1720.72 --> 1727.2
yeah once you can actually start to mold

1724.0 --> 1732.32
it into a game that part i take

1727.2 --> 1732.32
a lot of yeah direct control over

1736.84 --> 1739.84
probably

1753.36 --> 1760.08
well martin tallberg yeah

1756.399 --> 1767.84
not everybody single man

1760.08 --> 1767.84
developer game maker is very rare

1768.48 --> 1774.48
you know even indie games often just

1770.799 --> 1774.48
have a team of a couple of guys

1774.96 --> 1780.0
and then they might buy

1778.159 --> 1783.6000000000001
the rest of the element like buy good

1780.0 --> 1783.6
music or something i don't know

1791.12 --> 1794.9599999999998
what programming is yeah but look stone

1793.279 --> 1799.36
monkey 3d

1794.96 --> 1801.44
programming doesn't make graphics

1799.36 --> 1803.12
programming doesn't make music you have

1801.44 --> 1804.64
to actually have an art designer for

1803.12 --> 1809.84
that somebody that has a feel

1804.64 --> 1809.8400000000001
for that that do that

1820.84 --> 1823.84
hey

1834.84 --> 1837.84
hmm

1840.08 --> 1842.8799999999999
a more colored

1846.559 --> 1849.44
right anyway

1849.6 --> 1865.84
yeah i got ideas i got things i want

1875.2 --> 1879.679
yeah i don't know if it's ever gonna get

1877.279 --> 1881.84
there but i do want it you know

1879.679 --> 1884.24
i've always wanted that i've wanted to

1881.84 --> 1887.9189999999999
make computer games since i was freaking

1884.24 --> 1891.2
sick literally i would

1887.919 --> 1893.3600000000001
you know when i

1891.2 --> 1894.32
started out drawing was before i got

1893.36 --> 1896.6399999999999
computers

1894.32 --> 1898.6399999999999
before i got my first commodore 64

1896.64 --> 1900.48
through my brother

1898.64 --> 1903.039
before that time i would draw just

1900.48 --> 1905.44
standard things like a house and a tree

1903.039 --> 1907.44
and a car and all that and then i got a

1905.44 --> 1911.44
computer and after that point

1907.44 --> 1913.44
it's pretty much established

1911.44 --> 1916.64
well established that after that point

1913.44 --> 1919.679
i've only ever drawn computer games

1916.64 --> 1922.7990000000002
computer game levels

1919.679 --> 1924.96
design things even eventually

1922.799 --> 1925.84
and i've never stopped it i showed the

1924.96 --> 1928.3990000000001
maps

1925.84 --> 1928.399
the the

1932.84 --> 1936.1589999999999
map

1934.08 --> 1937.519
set of drawings and all that it's all

1936.159 --> 1940.5590000000002
like that because

1937.519 --> 1945.2
yeah that's what i wanted

1940.559 --> 1947.84
and then i tried to get into a school

1945.2 --> 1949.919
for computer game development and then

1947.84 --> 1952.559
they rejected me

1949.919 --> 1953.919
twice even though that's like i

1952.559 --> 1957.039
literally told them this

1953.919 --> 1960.64
is my life's dream

1957.039 --> 1960.64
rejected me twice

1964.96 --> 1969.3600000000001
but yeah just because society rejects me

1967.679 --> 1970.96
it doesn't mean that i'm gonna give up

1969.36 --> 1973.6789999999999
on something that i

1970.96 --> 1975.44
that's so ingrained in me and even my

1973.679 --> 1979.279
way of thinking

1975.44 --> 1981.1200000000001
just it's not gonna go away so

1979.279 --> 1983.519
yeah the idea originally that i would

1981.12 --> 1986.2399999999998
make a living with that

1983.519 --> 1987.44
that's kind of gone away but it doesn't

1986.24 --> 1990.72
mean that i just

1987.44 --> 1991.6000000000001
that i couldn't make really awesome

1990.72 --> 1995.6000000000001
games or

1991.6 --> 1997.84
just contribute to the scenery and maybe

1995.6 --> 2001.039
connect up with other developments

1997.84 --> 2004.08
developers and have just a specific

2001.039 --> 2007.44
influence that is good

2004.08 --> 2007.4399999999998
to improve quality

2007.919 --> 2015.2
to insert unique ideas perhaps

2011.76 --> 2016.24
if they'd arrive in me and that thing is

2015.2 --> 2018.72
still out there i

2016.24 --> 2021.1200000000001
yeah i like computer games i don't

2018.72 --> 2023.2
really want them to go away i think that

2021.12 --> 2025.4399999999998
the corporate system concerning video

2023.2 --> 2027.6000000000001
games is getting shittier

2025.44 --> 2028.88
and everybody gets that especially the

2027.6 --> 2030.48
gamers

2028.88 --> 2032.0
but that doesn't mean that video games

2030.48 --> 2035.1200000000001
has an entire concept

2032.0 --> 2036.799
should eventually be completely rejected

2035.12 --> 2040.32
and thrown away

2036.799 --> 2041.9189999999999
because i think that especially simpler

2040.32 --> 2046.72
games that just have

2041.919 --> 2049.04
pictures and music and conversations

2046.72 --> 2051.119
and all that story structures that are

2049.04 --> 2055.839
actually interesting

2051.119 --> 2058.0
and not just uh kitsch or super standard

2055.839 --> 2059.599
that those yeah that have the real depth

2058.0 --> 2061.52
to them

2059.599 --> 2063.3590000000004
it's like reading a book we're gonna put

2061.52 --> 2066.96
away books

2063.359 --> 2068.639
and reading no so

2066.96 --> 2071.28
i think computer games will probably

2068.639 --> 2075.2000000000003
always have a future like that

2071.28 --> 2075.76
but yeah the way it's going right now

2075.2 --> 2077.839
what is

2075.76 --> 2080.079
in the focus just turning everybody into

2077.839 --> 2089.839
a first person shooter and all that

2080.079 --> 2089.8390000000004
yeah that's not gonna lead anywhere good

2101.52 --> 2106.8
hey good servant exhausted why is that

2108.64 --> 2117.839
right anyway

2128.839 --> 2131.839
um

2156.839 --> 2159.839
hmm

2160.16 --> 2167.5989999999997
oh okay russia battery though

2163.76 --> 2169.92
right yeah

2167.599 --> 2173.839
well for me you know with me the issue

2169.92 --> 2173.839
is that i've only ever known

2174.72 --> 2182.0789999999997
computer programmers and such

2178.32 --> 2185.44
that were all yeah and gamer programmers

2182.079 --> 2186.48
like they're all super leftist that i

2185.44 --> 2190.32
remember

2186.48 --> 2190.32
like all of it

2190.4 --> 2195.839
then again i haven't really spread out

2193.44 --> 2197.52
too wide i basically at some point kind

2195.839 --> 2199.04
of got into the goth scene and then

2197.52 --> 2204.32
never really came out

2199.04 --> 2204.32
until i literally eject it permanently

2206.0 --> 2213.52
sort of like i'll never go

2209.52 --> 2216.24
there the same way i used to go there

2213.52 --> 2217.359
it only goes to something like that for

2216.24 --> 2219.7599999999998
a friend

2217.359 --> 2220.88
perhaps to meet them again but yeah not

2219.76 --> 2225.2000000000003
seeking that out

2220.88 --> 2230.85
for adventure or anything anymore but

2225.2 --> 2233.989
the music don't even like it anymore

2230.85 --> 2233.989
[Music]

2235.44 --> 2241.92
i'm just wondering like are there

2238.56 --> 2243.7599999999998
people out there that are kind of in the

2241.92 --> 2246.48
same mindset

2243.76 --> 2246.48
as i am

2247.599 --> 2251.76
that yeah that i'm not meeting like are

2250.4 --> 2253.76
there people out there

2251.76 --> 2255.6800000000003
that think what i just spoke about that

2253.76 --> 2256.5600000000004
that might actually be a really cool

2255.68 --> 2259.839
idea

2256.56 --> 2261.68
for them to get involved with not like

2259.839 --> 2264.16
oh that sounds like a good idea for

2261.68 --> 2265.49
somebody else no no

2264.16 --> 2267.52
is there anybody out there

2265.49 --> 2269.839
[Music]

2267.52 --> 2272.0
like are there people shy like yeah we

2269.839 --> 2274.0
just want to make computer games because

2272.0 --> 2275.92
we're really good at it we're just kind

2274.0 --> 2279.04
of running out of ideas because

2275.92 --> 2282.16
of yeah

2279.04 --> 2285.359
we already did our ideas

2282.16 --> 2287.44
you know i'm not gonna run out of ideas

2285.359 --> 2289.359
anytime soon if i would run into such a

2287.44 --> 2291.92
situation

2289.359 --> 2293.44
once i get like in a group that starts

2291.92 --> 2296.7200000000003
to really fabricate

2293.44 --> 2298.64
oh my god if you think that me on a

2296.72 --> 2300.7999999999997
daily basis bringing out

2298.64 --> 2303.44
or in a weekly basis bringing out like

2300.8 --> 2305.6800000000003
unique ideas

2303.44 --> 2308.48
that that's only because of the flat

2305.68 --> 2308.48
earth see no

2309.04 --> 2314.64
no i've been saving that [ __ ] up like

2311.839 --> 2314.64
all my life

2315.04 --> 2318.079
remember started drawing computer games

2317.2 --> 2321.5989999999997
when i was

2318.079 --> 2322.0
six so i've saved up some i've saved up

2321.599 --> 2323.599
some

2322.0 --> 2326.4
influence and insight and like

2323.599 --> 2328.96
structural creativism

2326.4 --> 2330.7200000000003
okay that have just not utilized it's

2328.96 --> 2332.64
lying in weight like are we

2330.72 --> 2333.7599999999998
ever going to be touched within this

2332.64 --> 2341.839
lifetime

2333.76 --> 2341.8390000000004
like that so

2356.0 --> 2359.52
open course where what

2363.28 --> 2367.76
i don't want to learn how to program i

2366.32 --> 2372.0
don't want to program

2367.76 --> 2372.0
i want to be a creative designer

2373.92 --> 2383.839
a director

2402.079 --> 2406.6400000000003
hmm okay that's interesting stone monkey

2408.839 --> 2411.839
3d

2416.88 --> 2423.44
if you know uh some

2420.16 --> 2425.2799999999997
yeah forums that you'd think might

2423.44 --> 2428.56
actually

2425.28 --> 2431.6800000000003
be right they won't just

2428.56 --> 2433.7599999999998
outright reject me for some reason or

2431.68 --> 2435.68
the atmosphere is terrible then yeah

2433.76 --> 2440.3190000000004
please do link me up with that

2435.68 --> 2443.2799999999997
i guess i would try i should

2440.319 --> 2444.64
i would at least save the links until i

2443.28 --> 2448.079
felt i was ready to

2444.64 --> 2449.7599999999998
try that out if you got if you got some

2448.079 --> 2451.76
that would be great

2449.76 --> 2453.44
if you're gonna make me search them on

2451.76 --> 2453.8390000000004
the internet then i'm not gonna do it

2453.44 --> 2456.88
because

2453.839 --> 2460.24
searching is a nightmare these days

2456.88 --> 2462.6400000000003
like i can't find anything anymore

2460.24 --> 2463.4399999999996
with freaking search engines the

2462.64 --> 2466.56
internet is

2463.44 --> 2469.119
piled full with crap it's

2466.56 --> 2472.0
all filler crap all of it i can't find

2469.119 --> 2472.0
[ __ ] anymore

2474.4 --> 2478.88
like if you don't know specifically what

2476.88 --> 2481.839
you're looking for you're not gonna find

2478.88 --> 2481.839
it

2483.76 --> 2487.6800000000003
like you're gonna find something like a

2486.079 --> 2490.48
list of a thousand things

2487.68 --> 2494.64
i'm not gonna click on a thousand things

2490.48 --> 2509.839
to try and find one thing

2494.64 --> 2509.839
it's just terrible

2513.599 --> 2517.839
so you got any stone monkey 3d

2520.839 --> 2523.839
gamedev.net

2525.76 --> 2537.8390000000004
is that a thing

2560.24 --> 2565.839
well that's taking its time

2570.64 --> 2579.839
okay i clicked it but

2574.72 --> 2579.839
it's taking a long time to connect

2585.52 --> 2593.839
we'll see

2610.96 --> 2621.839
yeah i think it might be down

2614.319 --> 2621.839
because it's not loading

2627.52 --> 2630.88
oh dear mark collard

2632.839 --> 2636.96
dude i wouldn't do that if i were you

2635.52 --> 2640.56
i think the best course of action

2636.96 --> 2644.319
towards that guy is to literally

2640.56 --> 2648.24
just ignore him permanently

2644.319 --> 2652.079
you know let him just

2648.24 --> 2656.72
slip down through the swamp into

2652.079 --> 2658.6400000000003
the abyss just let him slip

2656.72 --> 2660.319
because what's coming out of him is so

2658.64 --> 2663.839
disgusting it's just

2660.319 --> 2663.839
everything's turned around

2666.56 --> 2671.04
beyond savonier levels so yeah it's not

2669.359 --> 2674.319
worth it

2671.04 --> 2676.0
like you know it's no use

2674.319 --> 2691.599
punching a turret you're just gonna get

2676.0 --> 2695.599
[ __ ] on your hands

2691.599 --> 2699.599
oh but it's not working for me uh

2695.599 --> 2699.599
stone monkey 3d

2700.16 --> 2719.839
oh wait it is hmm

2728.88 --> 2735.44
all right new

2732.16 --> 2735.44
version available what

2737.52 --> 2749.599
what does that mean

2746.24 --> 2761.839
anyway i'll save the link

2749.599 --> 2761.839
in my bookmarks

2769.52 --> 2773.599
yeah i might just start watching some of

2772.319 --> 2776.48
this stuff to see

2773.599 --> 2777.52
what it's like you know but yeah it all

2776.48 --> 2780.48
depends really on

2777.52 --> 2782.16
what i'm gonna bump into because like if

2780.48 --> 2785.44
everything is just gonna make me

2782.16 --> 2789.839
puke like all the people

2785.44 --> 2789.839
then it's not gonna last

2790.16 --> 2795.44
because as i said before in the general

2793.44 --> 2803.839
scene that i've seen so far

2795.44 --> 2803.839
most of them are yeah

2806.319 --> 2811.68
like programmers now aren't exactly

2809.599 --> 2813.2000000000003
programmers of the 90s if you know what

2811.68 --> 2816.48
i mean

2813.2 --> 2818.24
but we'll see

2816.48 --> 2819.76
maybe it's not that bad maybe there's

2818.24 --> 2830.56
still some

2819.76 --> 2832.3190000000004
normal people out there who knows

2830.56 --> 2834.64
yeah martin tober have you ever seen his

2832.319 --> 2834.64
face

2834.96 --> 2840.0
like when i saw that face for the first

2838.24 --> 2845.839
time like

2840.0 --> 2845.839
i was shocked

2851.839 --> 2859.839
like because it was even worse than i

2853.44 --> 2859.839
had imagined it's pretty much

2870.839 --> 2873.839
anyway

2888.72 --> 2897.2
click the menu thing in the corner

2892.72 --> 2897.2
the menu thing which corner

2897.839 --> 2901.839
all right forums and yeah

2905.92 --> 2910.16
man this thing is loading kind of slow

2912.839 --> 2915.839
though

2940.839 --> 2943.839
so

2947.76 --> 2952.3190000000004
anyway thanks for the link uh yeah i

2949.76 --> 2954.96
might browse through that sometime

2952.319 --> 2956.64
who knows i might actually find

2954.96 --> 2959.04
something interesting or at least

2956.64 --> 2962.24
get a better gauge yet like what these

2959.04 --> 2962.24
people are like these days

2962.8 --> 2967.3590000000004
because i usually only deal with flat

2964.64 --> 2971.839
earthers and ballers these days

2967.359 --> 2971.839
and the normies outside on the street so

2971.93 --> 2974.989
[Music]

2983.359 --> 2987.2
no more colored look

2988.559 --> 2999.8390000000004
don't don't waste your su he's the worst

3007.68 --> 3012.3999999999996
yeah martin talbot i remember that too

3009.68 --> 3013.9199999999996
back then i thought that he was just a

3012.4 --> 3015.92
regular person with like

3013.92 --> 3018.16
cell phones tendencies you know just

3015.92 --> 3019.04
like others like right to hand and all

3018.16 --> 3023.04
that

3019.04 --> 3027.839
but yeah was kind of mistaken about that

3023.04 --> 3027.839
he is the worst

3040.64 --> 3055.839
i totally agree with that more colored

3071.52 --> 3073.839
all right

3074.88 --> 3078.4
well mark collards yeah you know that

3077.2 --> 3081.7599999999998
typically comes with

3078.4 --> 3082.1600000000003
severe salvonia syndrome but the thing

3081.76 --> 3085.28
is

3082.16 --> 3088.3999999999996
is not fooling anyone

3085.28 --> 3089.92
literally it's not fooling a single

3088.4 --> 3097.839
person out there

3089.92 --> 3097.839
everybody knows exactly what he is

3099.2 --> 3103.52
don't say that good servant

3108.839 --> 3111.839
no

3117.76 --> 3122.079
that's ridiculous you can't call

3120.079 --> 3123.8390000000004
somebody brilliant and then say they're

3122.079 --> 3126.319
very delusional those are counter

3123.839 --> 3129.2
opposites

3126.319 --> 3129.2
it's ridiculous

3132.559 --> 3139.8390000000004
and you're wasting your prayers

3150.48 --> 3156.88
yeah uh mark collard brilliant people

3154.4 --> 3159.04
are not delusional or they wouldn't be

3156.88 --> 3162.48
brilliant

3159.04 --> 3165.68
you know they might have personal issues

3162.48 --> 3167.839
they might like paranoid or something

3165.68 --> 3170.7999999999997
but yeah if you're like delusional and

3167.839 --> 3173.2
you get things blatantly wrong

3170.8 --> 3174.1600000000003
that that kind of undoes the brilliance

3173.2 --> 3177.68
you know that

3174.16 --> 3181.839
dims the shine which is brilliance

3177.68 --> 3181.839
so that's just not

3181.92 --> 3185.6800000000003
it's not brilliant at all it's a

3183.839 --> 3188.7999999999997
complete [ __ ]

3185.68 --> 3192.64
he might have once had an average

3188.8 --> 3194.079
decent mind and then yeah he allowed the

3192.64 --> 3196.16
salvagne to take him

3194.079 --> 3197.44
over probably took a whole lot of meds

3196.16 --> 3201.68
or whatever

3197.44 --> 3209.839
just look at the guy and it's all gone

3201.68 --> 3209.839
whatever he had it's gone burned away

3226.079 --> 3230.079
dizzy george sanford i don't know man

3230.88 --> 3235.44
i just kind got kind of stuck up on

3233.04 --> 3238.4
where he repeatedly made videos

3235.44 --> 3239.44
apparently i didn't really watch them

3238.4 --> 3242.48
but repeatedly

3239.44 --> 3245.119
stating that good servant and me are

3242.48 --> 3248.079
acting out our satanism

3245.119 --> 3249.2000000000003
by talking about god and all that in the

3248.079 --> 3252.88
bible

3249.2 --> 3252.8799999999997
and not actually believing it

3252.96 --> 3257.92
like based on absolutely nothing but his

3255.839 --> 3260.7999999999997
insertion on that very moment

3257.92 --> 3260.8
every single time

3261.04 --> 3264.5589999999997
yeah that's kind of where it kind of

3263.839 --> 3267.7599999999998
broke

3264.559 --> 3268.559
for me after that point she's just like

3267.76 --> 3270.6400000000003
no

3268.559 --> 3272.559
the guy deserves a giant kick in the

3270.64 --> 3275.7599999999998
balls v even has any

3272.559 --> 3279.92
left that's it

3275.76 --> 3281.8390000000004
just a piece of trash in the gutter

3279.92 --> 3285.44
don't don't try to pull him out just

3281.839 --> 3285.44
leave him in the gutter

3285.92 --> 3289.76
if he's gonna get out then he's gonna

3287.68 --> 3291.359
have to get out himself but he's not

3289.76 --> 3292.079
doing that he's just trying to pull

3291.359 --> 3294.5589999999997
other people

3292.079 --> 3296.319
in his gutter so don't give him don't

3294.559 --> 3297.76
give him a hand don't give him a finger

3296.319 --> 3300.72
nothing

3297.76 --> 3302.96
leave him to rot until he climbs out

3300.72 --> 3307.839
himself and then

3302.96 --> 3307.839
maybe maybe you could give it another

3318.839 --> 3321.839
look

3324.559 --> 3330.1600000000003
yeah you're wrong stone monkey 3d

3327.599 --> 3330.1600000000003
doesn't have a

3332.839 --> 3337.44
wrench

3334.4 --> 3340.4
and josie meek cielo

3337.44 --> 3340.4
doesn't have a wrench

3342.64 --> 3347.68
yeah there's not that many people in

3345.92 --> 3363.839
there anyway

3347.68 --> 3363.839
so yeah you're wrong

3367.2 --> 3377.839
oh that's right agm's here too

3395.359 --> 3398.88
yeah that's right because they didn't

3396.96 --> 3404.559
have anything to contribute

3398.88 --> 3406.2400000000002
just piling on more garbage

3404.559 --> 3408.079
so yeah that's how you get blocked

3406.24 --> 3410.24
that's right

3408.079 --> 3419.8390000000004
you want to be part of that too or you

3410.24 --> 3419.839
got something to say

3467.119 --> 3475.839
right completely pointless

3476.72 --> 3480.72
it's like how many of you guys in chat

3480.0 --> 3484.319
here

3480.72 --> 3488.799
though do ever do this like go to some

3484.319 --> 3492.24
live stream somewhere

3488.799 --> 3497.839
and then just get in the comments

3492.24 --> 3503.4399999999996
and just say why do you block everyone

3497.839 --> 3506.96
and that's it

3503.44 --> 3508.7200000000003
like is that is that a way to spend your

3506.96 --> 3511.68
time or

3508.72 --> 3513.7599999999998
because i don't care about that you know

3511.68 --> 3516.16
if i'm gonna watch a hangout and comment

3513.76 --> 3517.3590000000004
it's gonna be because i have something

3516.16 --> 3520.64
to say

3517.359 --> 3523.359
other than how people manage their shows

3520.64 --> 3524.64
you know i'm not even gonna complain in

3523.359 --> 3527.7599999999998
chat on how

3524.64 --> 3531.359
for example jose jg

3527.76 --> 3533.3590000000004
gonzalez does his show

3531.359 --> 3536.24
or who know like fight the flat earth or

3533.359 --> 3538.24
whatever because i just don't care

3536.24 --> 3540.0
like why would i go there and comment

3538.24 --> 3542.72
about that no no i'd much

3540.0 --> 3543.44
rather actually comment with just

3542.72 --> 3546.24
blatant

3543.44 --> 3547.359
arguments and such because that's much

3546.24 --> 3550.64
more effective

3547.359 --> 3552.64
it gets the people a lot more

3550.64 --> 3555.04
actually makes you look like you have a

3552.64 --> 3555.04
point

3555.44 --> 3559.839
you know

3562.4 --> 3568.559
oh really so logical bananas

3566.16 --> 3570.8799999999997
i take it you're a baller right so yeah

3568.559 --> 3574.0
where is that

3570.88 --> 3574.0
where's your sphere edge

3574.16 --> 3578.64
right it's supposed to be the horizon

3576.24 --> 3582.8799999999997
right but it's not really

3578.64 --> 3586.16
because it doesn't work black swan

3582.88 --> 3587.44
yeah you can see too far the the

3586.16 --> 3590.8799999999997
geometry

3587.44 --> 3591.68
would not allow it and if you're gonna

3590.88 --> 3595.04
assume that

3591.68 --> 3596.24
light bends around the globe to justify

3595.04 --> 3598.839
that

3596.24 --> 3600.9599999999996
you got a problem because you can't

3598.839 --> 3604.64
prove terrestrial

3600.96 --> 3608.0
refraction on the globe

3604.64 --> 3611.44
if terrestrial refraction exists

3608.0 --> 3613.28
because you can't measure the geometry

3611.44 --> 3616.16
because you are presuming light is

3613.28 --> 3618.0
bending and if that would be the case

3616.16 --> 3619.7599999999998
then you couldn't prove that light is

3618.0 --> 3621.839
bending because you couldn't prove the

3619.76 --> 3625.28
geometry because light was bending

3621.839 --> 3629.04
it's called a paradox oh

3625.28 --> 3631.8390000000004
pretending looming isn't real ah

3629.04 --> 3634.319
too late i already addressed it i

3631.839 --> 3636.24
already addressed it before you inserted

3634.319 --> 3638.88
that standard baller

3636.24 --> 3640.72
piece of vomit that i actually have a

3638.88 --> 3641.6800000000003
counter argument for that i worked out

3640.72 --> 3645.2
in last week

3641.68 --> 3647.68
on the flat earth debates remember

3645.2 --> 3650.0
looming it's not even looming the

3647.68 --> 3650.48
horizon cannot loom above the horizon

3650.0 --> 3654.64
this is

3650.48 --> 3657.04
a technical impossibility

3654.64 --> 3658.72
when it comes to visual displacing

3657.04 --> 3661.68
effects

3658.72 --> 3664.0789999999997
miraging looming it can't do that but

3661.68 --> 3667.5989999999997
even if it could

3664.079 --> 3670.6400000000003
this supposed cause of this looming

3667.599 --> 3671.6800000000003
right into a flat plane supposedly right

3670.64 --> 3674.0
which would be

3671.68 --> 3676.0
caused by light bending around the globe

3674.0 --> 3679.359
making it see more more flat

3676.0 --> 3682.4
right well you can't prove

3679.359 --> 3686.72
how that works that it's there

3682.4 --> 3689.76
if it exists because if it exists

3686.72 --> 3692.16
then you can't optically

3689.76 --> 3694.48
measure the geometry of the thing we're

3692.16 --> 3696.48
all standing on

3694.48 --> 3697.599
because it's bending and you can't do

3696.48 --> 3700.64
geometry

3697.599 --> 3701.76
with bending lines doesn't work you

3700.64 --> 3705.359
can't establish

3701.76 --> 3708.079
the r value the geometry that you assume

3705.359 --> 3708.799
in terrestrial refraction it's a

3708.079 --> 3712.319
intricate

3708.799 --> 3713.119
part it's literally written there seven

3712.319 --> 3717.52
over six

3713.119 --> 3720.88
r radius radius value

3717.52 --> 3725.0389999999998
yeah you can't establish that if

3720.88 --> 3727.52
light was actually bending with a curve

3725.039 --> 3729.599
everywhere because then yeah you can't

3727.52 --> 3730.799
visually establish a geometry you can

3729.599 --> 3733.839
have a tangent

3730.799 --> 3734.799
to a sphere edge in order to establish

3733.839 --> 3737.839
the radius

3734.799 --> 3740.88
that is an intricate baseline

3737.839 --> 3743.2799999999997
part of terrestrial refraction

3740.88 --> 3743.28
okay

3747.28 --> 3755.119
i don't have to prove geophysics wrong

3751.599 --> 3757.52
it is wrong it doesn't prove it's right

3755.119 --> 3758.96
it's bunch of [ __ ] assertions i just

3757.52 --> 3764.24
explained it

3758.96 --> 3767.599
they have no proof it's all garbage

3764.24 --> 3770.8799999999997
the earth is not a ball the horizon

3767.599 --> 3774.319
is not a sphere edge light

3770.88 --> 3777.76
doesn't bend in circles

3774.319 --> 3781.2799999999997
this is all science fiction garbage

3777.76 --> 3783.44
to try and manipulate reality itself

3781.28 --> 3785.8390000000004
just to justify that the earth you're

3783.44 --> 3789.039
standing on is not actually a ball

3785.839 --> 3789.0389999999998
that's what that all is

3791.33 --> 3794.5499999999997
[Music]

3795.119 --> 3799.92
the word salad forest well that's funny

3797.839 --> 3802.96
that you would call it that because

3799.92 --> 3806.0
the words i just use are

3802.96 --> 3808.64
your argumentation words that's

3806.0 --> 3809.44
the words the terminologies that you

3808.64 --> 3812.72
guys

3809.44 --> 3813.76
forward to justify why the earth doesn't

3812.72 --> 3816.319
actually look

3813.76 --> 3817.8390000000004
or measure like a ball those are your

3816.319 --> 3821.359
terminologies

3817.839 --> 3823.2799999999997
that i respond to intricately explain

3821.359 --> 3824.48
put out the natural consequences and

3823.28 --> 3827.039
then point out

3824.48 --> 3828.079
how terrestrial refraction is a paradox

3827.039 --> 3830.2400000000002
technically

3828.079 --> 3831.44
and i'm right about this technically

3830.24 --> 3834.16
correct

3831.44 --> 3835.52
confirmed by other people that know

3834.16 --> 3838.0789999999997
their stuff

3835.52 --> 3839.44
kind of proud that i that i put this on

3838.079 --> 3843.44
the table

3839.44 --> 3846.48
yeah prove it

3843.44 --> 3847.599
what prove it that's a paradox that's

3846.48 --> 3850.48
ridiculous

3847.599 --> 3851.3590000000004
you can't prove something is a paradox

3850.48 --> 3854.079
you can only

3851.359 --> 3855.0389999999998
lay out why it is with natural

3854.079 --> 3857.44
consequences

3855.039 --> 3860.6400000000003
and then figure out how it is a paradox

3857.44 --> 3860.64
like i just described

3861.01 --> 3865.44
[Music]

3862.4 --> 3866.1600000000003
yeah technically i just said that are

3865.44 --> 3870.319
you freaking

3866.16 --> 3870.799
deaf why don't you unmute my show and

3870.319 --> 3874.4
actually

3870.799 --> 3874.4
listen to what i'm saying

3874.64 --> 3882.96
terrestrial refraction is a paradox

3879.2 --> 3883.52
it requires seven over six r a radius

3882.96 --> 3886.48
value

3883.52 --> 3889.359
as a core foundation of its effect to

3886.48 --> 3894.0
prove that light bends around the ball

3889.359 --> 3897.5989999999997
but you can't prove a ball

3894.0 --> 3900.16
if light bends in curves

3897.599 --> 3901.76
because then you can't establish the

3900.16 --> 3905.0389999999998
geometry

3901.76 --> 3906.7200000000003
values of that ball because you need

3905.039 --> 3910.0
straight lines

3906.72 --> 3913.4399999999996
in geometry to establish such things

3910.0 --> 3916.72
it's impossible it's a paradox

3913.44 --> 3923.839
if terrestrial refraction exists

3916.72 --> 3923.839
then it couldn't be proven

3926.079 --> 3929.92
oh logical banana you mean prove it to

3928.72 --> 3933.2799999999997
somebody that's

3929.92 --> 3933.28
dumb like you

3934.24 --> 3937.4399999999996
what you didn't understand what i was

3935.839 --> 3939.7599999999998
just saying

3937.44 --> 3941.44
even though i explained it three times

3939.76 --> 3945.6800000000003
you still don't get it

3941.44 --> 3948.319
so it's not that i'm wrong

3945.68 --> 3951.2799999999997
it's just that you're too dumb to

3948.319 --> 3953.2799999999997
understand what i'm talking about

3951.28 --> 3955.76
because my words here are not that

3953.28 --> 3959.119
complicated

3955.76 --> 3959.8390000000004
i'm not using technical super language

3959.119 --> 3964.2400000000002
here or

3959.839 --> 3967.44
like professional specific

3964.24 --> 3971.359
language no no these are just basic

3967.44 --> 3973.2000000000003
concepts geometry tangent lines in

3971.359 --> 3976.4
geometry

3973.2 --> 3979.5989999999997
the presumption of curving light

3976.4 --> 3982.1600000000003
radius value also part of geometry

3979.599 --> 3984.0
all that it's not that difficult blah

3982.16 --> 3987.52
blah blah blah

3984.0 --> 3989.28
yeah yep put put those fingers in those

3987.52 --> 3990.72
ears buddy

3989.28 --> 3994.079
because this is not going away

3990.72 --> 3996.64
terrestrial refraction is a paradox

3994.079 --> 3998.319
there's nothing you can do about it

3996.64 --> 4000.48
nothing at all

3998.319 --> 4001.92
you can ignore it you can walk away like

4000.48 --> 4004.2400000000002
all the ballers

4001.92 --> 4006.799
and be all bitter forget this ever

4004.24 --> 4010.319
happened and then start to imagine how

4006.799 --> 4015.52
you're actually on the right side here

4010.319 --> 4015.52
huh but it's not real though

4016.24 --> 4022.4799999999996
it's just you forgetting trying again

4020.319 --> 4024.5589999999997
coming to the same results then going

4022.48 --> 4027.359
away again forgetting about it

4024.559 --> 4028.0
about it and trying again at the same

4027.359 --> 4031.2799999999997
time we

4028.0 --> 4033.68
on a weekly basis upgrade our technical

4031.28 --> 4036.799
insight

4033.68 --> 4040.16
perfect explanations find

4036.799 --> 4043.44
even more flaws in the heliocentric

4040.16 --> 4047.1189999999997
modeling process as we go

4043.44 --> 4050.2400000000002
weekly alteration updates improvements

4047.119 --> 4053.2000000000003
continue building more

4050.24 --> 4054.8799999999997
no stagnation here we're continuing

4053.2 --> 4056.72
building it's working better it's

4054.88 --> 4058.7200000000003
getting more recognition

4056.72 --> 4060.9599999999996
it's getting understood better except by

4058.72 --> 4062.799
ballers that don't want to understand

4060.96 --> 4064.079
they just want to call it nonsense blah

4062.799 --> 4067.2
blah blah blah blah

4064.079 --> 4068.96
word soup because they're too stupid

4067.2 --> 4077.0389999999998
to let it sink in that they're just

4068.96 --> 4080.319
freaking wrong

4077.039 --> 4083.599
yes every geophysicist is too

4080.319 --> 4086.48
dumb that's right logical bananas

4083.599 --> 4088.4
because if you're a geophysicist then

4086.48 --> 4091.599
you went through all that

4088.4 --> 4094.48
got into the job without realizing

4091.599 --> 4094.799
that it's complete [ __ ] [ __ ] and

4094.48 --> 4098.0
are

4094.799 --> 4099.44
assuming nonsense

4098.0 --> 4101.6
if you if you didn't find that out

4099.44 --> 4105.12
during your course then yeah you are

4101.6 --> 4107.839
dumb although yeah you could have just

4105.12 --> 4109.759
found out and then like be like oh [ __ ]

4107.839 --> 4110.799
i mean kind of in a profession this has

4109.759 --> 4113.839
some serious

4110.799 --> 4116.56
r assuming issues i'm not going to be

4113.839 --> 4119.44
part of that and still do my profession

4116.56 --> 4120.799
you know know about what's in in rocks

4119.44 --> 4123.12
in mountains and

4120.799 --> 4124.239
yeah the things that are actually

4123.12 --> 4127.44
provable

4124.239 --> 4129.919999999999
relatively close by and i'm not saying

4127.44 --> 4132.879999999999
that all geology is completely useless

4129.92 --> 4134.799
like knowledge about earth and stone and

4132.88 --> 4135.92
all that is kind of useful it's just

4134.799 --> 4138.96
that

4135.92 --> 4140.799
bigger picture with the ball assumption

4138.96 --> 4144.719
parts that's when it gets

4140.799 --> 4148.4
science fictiony and stupid and unproven

4144.719 --> 4150.88
and proven wrong on every single

4148.4 --> 4155.759
occasion

4150.88 --> 4155.759
so yeah that's right

4156.4 --> 4162.0
why is science moving forward without

4159.279 --> 4164.400000000001
you while you beg for money online

4162.0 --> 4167.359
oh my god well it's not you're just a

4164.4 --> 4167.3589999999995
stupid liar

4172.159 --> 4175.199
science is moving forward oh really so

4174.239 --> 4178.4
what's the latest

4175.199 --> 4180.159
proven scientific hypothesis

4178.4 --> 4182.719
that has been forwarded by the

4180.159 --> 4184.719
scientific community logical bananas

4182.719 --> 4186.319
you tell me what's the latest

4184.719 --> 4189.04
scientifically proven

4186.319 --> 4190.080000000001
theory that has been put on the table

4189.04 --> 4195.2789999999995
recently

4190.08 --> 4195.2789999999995
by the science community logical bananas

4198.08 --> 4204.96
you're a dumbass you're a complete

4201.28 --> 4208.639999999999
[ __ ] dumbass idiot

4204.96 --> 4210.88
liar to yourself mostly

4208.64 --> 4212.320000000001
but you probably kind of know that

4210.88 --> 4214.4800000000005
you're lying to yourself

4212.32 --> 4215.759999999999
and you're okay with it so that just

4214.48 --> 4218.879999999999
makes you a liar

4215.76 --> 4221.4400000000005
anyway whether you know the truth

4218.88 --> 4224.0
or don't you know you don't have to know

4221.44 --> 4226.5599999999995
the truth to be a liar

4224.0 --> 4228.96
about it you can just be a complete

4226.56 --> 4231.360000000001
[ __ ] that's to cower this

4228.96 --> 4233.12
to confront themselves with the truth

4231.36 --> 4234.639999999999
and then just stick to the lie because

4233.12 --> 4238.4
it's easier

4234.64 --> 4240.400000000001
huh oh caps now oh somebody's getting

4238.4 --> 4243.5199999999995
triggered

4240.4 --> 4245.679
i think yeah

4243.52 --> 4247.76
the logic on your banana is kind of

4245.679 --> 4253.4400000000005
turning black

4247.76 --> 4253.4400000000005
i think it's rotting you're starting to

4256.84 --> 4262.719
smell

4258.88 --> 4262.719
look at that look at him squirt

4262.88 --> 4266.2390000000005
all that logic is all squirted out of

4264.8 --> 4269.84
that banana by now

4266.239 --> 4273.599999999999
it's pathetic a really sad person

4269.84 --> 4276.56
really really sad

4273.6 --> 4277.6
million dollars oh yeah yeah yeah

4276.56 --> 4280.719
because

4277.6 --> 4282.4800000000005
we all know that the only thing that

4280.719 --> 4283.84
actually makes signs legitimate

4282.48 --> 4287.28
according to you

4283.84 --> 4291.1990000000005
i guess is how much money you

4287.28 --> 4294.48
get as a prize for your science

4291.199 --> 4296.5599999999995
right that's how it works so if you got

4294.48 --> 4299.199
a lot of money

4296.56 --> 4300.719
and a title that makes you really good

4299.199 --> 4303.839999999999
scientist

4300.719 --> 4307.04
it's not actually just

4303.84 --> 4310.32
applying the scientific method you know

4307.04 --> 4312.159
getting a proven hypothesis working it

4310.32 --> 4314.5599999999995
out that other people can repeat

4312.159 --> 4316.159
now that's not none about that right

4314.56 --> 4318.719
right

4316.159 --> 4320.0
now it's just having a lot of money

4318.719 --> 4323.199
proofs

4320.0 --> 4329.44
it proves you're a good scientist

4323.199 --> 4333.5199999999995
yeah it is gold it is gold that's right

4329.44 --> 4336.719
because you're not getting anywhere

4333.52 --> 4343.52
you're literally a [ __ ] in chat

4336.719 --> 4345.6
a [ __ ]

4343.52 --> 4347.1990000000005
that's why nobody's gonna time him out

4345.6 --> 4350.88
here or ban him

4347.199 --> 4350.879999999999
if you do that i'm gonna kick you

4351.36 --> 4354.239
just so you know

4354.8 --> 4359.360000000001
leave it all in there for everyone to

4357.199 --> 4360.4
see to just see what kind of people we

4359.36 --> 4364.0
deal with sometimes

4360.4 --> 4368.08
how disgusting they are

4364.0 --> 4371.12
straight faced bluffing liars disgusting

4368.08 --> 4374.719
individuals nothing better to do than

4371.12 --> 4379.199
lie in other people's chat and insert

4374.719 --> 4381.36
[ __ ] provable [ __ ] lies

4379.199 --> 4383.5199999999995
about what science supposedly is what it

4381.36 --> 4385.44
does what makes people a good scientist

4383.52 --> 4387.52
all of it he's uttering here he's all

4385.44 --> 4391.28
peer pressure based cultish

4387.52 --> 4392.88
lies you're a scientist cultist you're a

4391.28 --> 4396.5599999999995
pathetic

4392.88 --> 4398.159000000001
pathetic individual not the average

4396.56 --> 4399.120000000001
person you know and the average person

4398.159 --> 4401.759999999999
is just

4399.12 --> 4404.64
going by what they're taught but yeah at

4401.76 --> 4407.280000000001
some point if they were confronted

4404.64 --> 4408.96
with details that actually disprove what

4407.28 --> 4409.759999999999
they've been taught yeah they might have

4408.96 --> 4412.0
some doubts

4409.76 --> 4414.2390000000005
they might feel very uncomfortable but

4412.0 --> 4417.04
usually they just walk away

4414.239 --> 4419.04
or they get angry and then walk away but

4417.04 --> 4422.08
now this case here this little

4419.04 --> 4423.04
logical banana stroll this is a bald

4422.08 --> 4426.159
tart

4423.04 --> 4430.88
this is somebody that is gonna double

4426.159 --> 4432.639999999999
down on their lies no matter what

4430.88 --> 4434.2390000000005
i've always wondered like if people like

4432.64 --> 4437.12
that if they would actually

4434.239 --> 4439.28
allow themselves to be killed for their

4437.12 --> 4443.04
own lies if they would double down into

4439.28 --> 4446.96
death i really wonder

4443.04 --> 4446.96
maybe i'll have to try that out sometime

4447.92 --> 4451.6
so yeah if you want to try that out

4449.36 --> 4454.239
logical bananas see

4451.6 --> 4457.92
see how far you will push your lies you

4454.239 --> 4457.919999999999
can try that out with me if you like

4459.6 --> 4464.88
i've i volunteer myself to be part of

4461.92 --> 4464.88
that experiment

4465.52 --> 4470.2390000000005
maybe you could do some some science in

4468.4 --> 4473.839999999999
your life after all

4470.239 --> 4473.839999999999
let's make your life the independent

4480.84 --> 4483.84
variable

4485.0 --> 4489.989
[Music]

4501.679 --> 4507.52
well yeah sure i'm i wouldn't be

4505.199 --> 4511.839999999999
surprised if nobody wants to touch you

4507.52 --> 4511.84
because you're disgusting yeah

4512.8 --> 4516.8
because hey if you're gonna punch a turd

4514.96 --> 4518.96
you're gonna get [ __ ] on your hands so

4516.8 --> 4520.719
yeah nobody's gonna touch you don't

4518.96 --> 4521.12
worry about that logical bananas you can

4520.719 --> 4524.4800000000005
just

4521.12 --> 4526.159
sit and rot in your gutter

4524.48 --> 4528.5599999999995
nobody's gonna touch you don't worry

4526.159 --> 4528.5599999999995
about it

4535.199 --> 4540.239
no not really no you're not that

4537.679 --> 4540.2390000000005
interesting

4540.88 --> 4545.92
no i don't even think that people are

4544.08 --> 4547.5199999999995
actually gonna read what you're saying

4545.92 --> 4549.4400000000005
in my chat

4547.52 --> 4551.52
because after the first few sentences

4549.44 --> 4552.239
they know exactly what that's all going

4551.52 --> 4555.679
to be

4552.239 --> 4557.159
because people like you are incredibly

4555.679 --> 4560.0
predictable

4557.159 --> 4563.28
incredibly predictable

4560.0 --> 4565.84
so predictable that you could if

4563.28 --> 4568.639999999999
if you could make money of getting

4565.84 --> 4572.400000000001
predictions right about baller behavior

4568.64 --> 4572.400000000001
people would get rich pretty quickly

4573.6 --> 4577.4400000000005
because they're that dumb and

4576.08 --> 4579.92
predictable and they don't

4577.44 --> 4581.199
learn from their mistakes they always

4579.92 --> 4584.159
double down

4581.199 --> 4586.879999999999
always and that makes you incredibly

4584.159 --> 4586.879999999999
predictable

4591.92 --> 4597.84
see this is all regurgitated crap

4595.12 --> 4599.44
that trolls have spewed out even five

4597.84 --> 4603.4400000000005
years ago it's the same

4599.44 --> 4604.0
[ __ ] people almost word for word the

4603.44 --> 4607.44
same

4604.0 --> 4609.199
[ __ ] the same

4607.44 --> 4611.12
in the meantime yeah they don't have a

4609.199 --> 4612.5599999999995
geometrical horizon anymore because it

4611.12 --> 4615.84
only exists in the math

4612.56 --> 4617.6
terrestrial refraction is a paradox

4615.84 --> 4620.96
you can't have gas pressure without a

4617.6 --> 4623.6
container you know gravity doesn't exist

4620.96 --> 4624.4800000000005
it's even getting wide admission in

4623.6 --> 4629.52
physicist

4624.48 --> 4632.879999999999
community huh huh huh logical banana

4629.52 --> 4637.360000000001
but hey maybe we could mill

4632.88 --> 4637.36
and win a million dollars proving

4639.76 --> 4643.12
oh sure you do well jesus doesn't love

4642.64 --> 4646.719
you

4643.12 --> 4649.679
because you're a disgusting liar

4646.719 --> 4650.159
you know so yeah you can lie about that

4649.679 --> 4653.679
too

4650.159 --> 4657.28
but no i wouldn't believe

4653.679 --> 4659.36
that with everything you said so far

4657.28 --> 4662.239
people that are that disgusting they can

4659.36 --> 4665.599999999999
say they believe in jesus

4662.239 --> 4668.5599999999995
but they don't act like it you know

4665.6 --> 4670.159000000001
you know you did you know that there's

4668.56 --> 4672.64
plenty of satanists

4670.159 --> 4674.4
or well not satanic satan worshippers

4672.64 --> 4676.84
that also believe in jesus

4674.4 --> 4678.639999999999
you know so maybe that's what you were

4676.84 --> 4682.2390000000005
implying

4678.64 --> 4682.2390000000005
because love from you

4683.199 --> 4693.839999999999
don't know what would be worse

4696.64 --> 4707.84
why don't you talk to martin like that

4699.44 --> 4707.839999999999
martin wants to address you he can

4709.28 --> 4714.08
yeah nobody's gonna give anyone a

4711.44 --> 4718.719
million dollars

4714.08 --> 4719.679
nobody all that ever was all that ever

4718.719 --> 4721.12
will be

4719.679 --> 4724.2390000000005
because this shot of [ __ ] happened

4721.12 --> 4725.84
before ballers making bets

4724.239 --> 4728.0
tell you oh don't just do this and

4725.84 --> 4730.88
you'll get money yeah

4728.0 --> 4733.6
how many people have actually paid out

4730.88 --> 4736.2390000000005
to a flat earther after winning a bet

4733.6 --> 4737.679
ballers that is how many people do you

4736.239 --> 4739.28
know out there

4737.679 --> 4741.12
in the last five years that have

4739.28 --> 4745.04
actually paid out yeah

4741.12 --> 4745.84
zero because ballers are lying pieces of

4792.4 --> 4796.159
let let the [ __ ]

4793.76 --> 4798.159000000001
dry up and then maybe after a while see

4796.159 --> 4799.759999999999
it might slip in and a new plant

4798.159 --> 4801.759999999999
could grow out of that but yeah you're

4799.76 --> 4804.4800000000005
just [ __ ] there's nothing fresh coming

4801.76 --> 4806.56
out of there

4804.48 --> 4807.5199999999995
and there is no arguments i already laid

4806.56 --> 4810.159000000001

4831.6 --> 4838.2390000000005

4835.52 --> 4840.719
even any arguments for your ball that

4838.239 --> 4842.718999999999
make any damn sense that are beyond just

4840.719 --> 4844.32
superficially what other ballers told

4842.719 --> 4846.639
you without telling you

4844.32 --> 4847.92
on top of that oh yeah by the way the

4846.639 --> 4850.96
flat earth has already

4847.92 --> 4852.8
debunked this yeah they love to fail to

4850.96 --> 4853.84
mention that to new people to other

4852.8 --> 4855.4400000000005
people out there

4853.84 --> 4857.12
even their fellow ballers because they

4855.44 --> 4859.5199999999995
just don't like to be

4857.12 --> 4861.199
conscious about that the flat earthers

4859.52 --> 4864.0
are always

4861.199 --> 4865.28
crushing every single [ __ ] argument

4864.0 --> 4867.04
they bring forth

4865.28 --> 4869.5199999999995
so you just get to hear the same

4867.04 --> 4871.5199999999995
argument and then they fail to mention

4869.52 --> 4873.52
oh yeah the flat earth has already

4871.52 --> 4876.719
destroyed the argument by the way
