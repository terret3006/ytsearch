a

97.56 --> 103.86
it's really hard to get that one back in

100.079 --> 106.439
the routines anyway right so the weather

103.86 --> 108.78
today is absolutely beautiful so I I

106.439 --> 111.29899999999999
guess that the weather prediction

108.78 --> 113.96000000000001
totally called it

111.299 --> 113.96000000000001
I mean

114.18 --> 119.42
this is a pristine Blue Sky I've ever

116.7 --> 119.42
seen one

119.82 --> 124.13999999999999
there's been a couple of trails but they

122.34 --> 128.42000000000002
seem to

124.14 --> 128.42
just diffuse up there

128.64 --> 134.22
I think there's probably plenty of wind

131.16 --> 136.92
eye up it's a little bit of wind down

134.22 --> 140.64
here but not a lot

136.92 --> 143.64
so yeah it's like an amazing

140.64 --> 145.379
Summers after day or almost after

143.64 --> 147.54
Summer's Day

145.379 --> 150.66
plants are very much enjoying it have to

147.54 --> 155.76
really water them all up

150.66 --> 155.76
that mint plan is just exploding

157.379 --> 162.56
right

158.52 --> 162.56
rosemary plants still blooming

162.84 --> 166.81900000000002
and yeah skies are super blue

174.26 --> 182.0
right so hey LSG first in chat good to

178.019 --> 182.0
see you oh Tara 306

182.099 --> 189.35999999999999
it is

183.78 --> 189.36
Tuesday the 5th of September 2023

194.879 --> 200.099
pure

196.34 --> 202.14000000000001
27 degrees Celsius right

200.099 --> 206.29999999999998
yeah

202.14 --> 206.29999999999998
says it might become 29 even

207.3 --> 211.94
looks like it's going to be around 30.

212.28 --> 217.34
until the weekend

214.68 --> 217.34
heavy

220.319 --> 224.17999999999998
but nice I like it

226.62 --> 231.37900000000002
I mean this weather is really good for

229.26 --> 234.54
my mood

231.379 --> 236.7
I really needed this

234.54 --> 239.819
so I got up pretty early because I

236.7 --> 242.099
basically got cooked out of my bed

239.819 --> 245.57999999999998
even though I did go to bed it kind of

242.099 --> 248.7
late but I still feel good

245.58 --> 250.85000000000002
I had a really good dinner yesterday

248.7 --> 254.099
and

250.85 --> 256.5
[Music]

254.099 --> 258.239
yeah I took a shower this morning then

256.5 --> 260.6
went for groceries in this beautiful

258.239 --> 260.59999999999997
weather

260.82 --> 266.34
stock back up on vitamin C some yeah

263.88 --> 267.96
that because it literally had run out of

266.34 --> 270.9
the last

267.96 --> 273.06
the last capsule this is part of the

270.9 --> 275.58
reason why I really needed that support

273.06 --> 277.8
yesterday and I did get it and so I was

275.58 --> 280.19899999999996
able to get it today I'm really

277.8 --> 282.74
relieved

280.199 --> 282.74
right

282.96 --> 287.21999999999997
and I'm pretty much stocked up for like

285.24 --> 289.86
the next

287.22 --> 292.86
two days

289.86 --> 294.96000000000004
maybe a bit more I don't know I'm not

292.86 --> 298.38
gonna

294.96 --> 300.06
what the what the hell is that doing in

298.38 --> 301.919
here

300.06 --> 305.46
what

301.919 --> 307.75899999999996
how did this Leaf get inside the water

305.46 --> 307.75899999999996
bottle

309.0 --> 313.62
maybe when I was like giving it water

311.04 --> 315.47900000000004
and then a leaf just fell in or

313.62 --> 317.16
something when I was given the plants

315.479 --> 319.08
what a weird thing

317.16 --> 321.41900000000004
anyway

319.08 --> 324.419
yeah

321.419 --> 328.02
drink 300 milliliter orange juice well I

324.419 --> 329.94
wish I could afford that damn it

328.02 --> 333.71999999999997
sounds delicious

329.94 --> 335.58
I mean I I got some of that but I don't

333.72 --> 337.199
drink that every day because it's just

335.58 --> 340.139
too expensive

337.199 --> 342.56
but yes and the the supplements are much

340.139 --> 342.56
cheaper

344.88 --> 348.9
right anyway hello

346.919 --> 350.58
Seth wildenberg

348.9 --> 352.62
low fruit

350.58 --> 355.52
Richard G

352.62 --> 355.52
good to see you all

356.58 --> 363.3
ah today I feel a lot better like well

360.18 --> 366.24
not having drank beer the previous day

363.3 --> 367.74
because it it was really wearing on me

366.24 --> 370.44
yesterday

367.74 --> 372.84000000000003
it's not like it I was incapable of

370.44 --> 374.759
doing anything it's just that I felt it

372.84 --> 379.09999999999997
present so much

374.759 --> 379.1
and I'm so glad that's behind me again

380.16 --> 385.8
like it was definitely not alluring to

383.94 --> 388.88
be like oh yeah I want to drink again

385.8 --> 388.88
like no no

395.759 --> 399.3
one later

397.1 --> 402.3
uh no

399.3 --> 405.12
wait uh one big bottle is like half a

402.3 --> 407.58
liter so it would be one and a half of

405.12 --> 409.979
those so three quarter liter

407.58 --> 412.62
that's it

409.979 --> 414.479
which is the half the usual amount that

412.62 --> 416.16
I used to take I used to take one and a

414.479 --> 418.139
half liter

416.16 --> 420.3
every day

418.139 --> 424.759
right

420.3 --> 424.759
what uh yeah that that time is over

427.34 --> 430.75899999999996
he could see you

431.58 --> 437.81899999999996
all right so yeah fully stocked up

434.759 --> 441.259
even got some fresh rookula

437.819 --> 441.259
really looking forward to that

442.02 --> 447.919
gusto

444.62 --> 447.919
Illuminati Castle

448.52 --> 453.44
and minty so I got the full works

455.819 --> 460.16
also watched two movies

458.58 --> 462.419
and believe that

460.16 --> 464.699
I can barely believe that I actually

462.419 --> 466.38
watched two complete movies yesterday on

464.699 --> 469.099
Netflix

466.38 --> 472.979
one was

469.099 --> 475.979
interesting but weird

472.979 --> 479.639
but and the other one was great really

475.979 --> 483.31899999999996
good so first one was called Lou

479.639 --> 483.319
and it wasn't yeah

483.599 --> 491.4
it was it had feminist influences in its

487.44 --> 493.919
setup but despite that it's just that

491.4 --> 496.88
the acting and the characters were just

493.919 --> 496.88
very interesting

497.58 --> 501.78
it's basically about some serial killer

500.4 --> 505.44
that

501.78 --> 507.84
kidnaps the kid of his own wife

505.44 --> 510.12
which is like his own kid

507.84 --> 512.459
and like

510.12 --> 515.099
the story and the way it rolls out you

512.459 --> 516.7189999999999
just find out more it it was a pretty

515.099 --> 517.979
interesting story

516.719 --> 520.1400000000001
but

517.979 --> 523.14
when you look objectively you definitely

520.14 --> 526.5
realize that there's like oh

523.14 --> 528.959
like white male bad type of thing not

526.5 --> 531.32
super stereotypical but still it is

528.959 --> 531.3199999999999
there

531.779 --> 535.04
and it's like women

535.98 --> 540.0
the main roles are women basically but

538.5 --> 543.32
it's an interesting one it's like an

540.0 --> 543.32
older woman that is like

543.959 --> 549.7199999999999
CIA xcia or something but it was an

547.14 --> 551.58
interesting character I thought

549.72 --> 553.38
just like yeah this is really

551.58 --> 557.22
interesting the way

553.38 --> 558.8389999999999
you don't see that in movies a lot right

557.22 --> 562.5
but

558.839 --> 564.72
yeah music was meh sometimes just like

562.5 --> 566.76
really poorly placed electronic stuff

564.72 --> 568.5600000000001
it's like what the [ __ ] is that doing in

566.76 --> 569.399
this movie is that shouldn't be there at

568.56 --> 572.8199999999999
all

569.399 --> 576.38
but anyway that was one the other one

572.82 --> 580.019
was like a historical movie

576.38 --> 582.74
1917. which was apparently based on the

580.019 --> 587.7
direct testimony of

582.74 --> 589.32
old first world war veteran

587.7 --> 595.519
British one

589.32 --> 595.519
that movie is really really impressive

599.399 --> 604.76
and it's fair it's fascinating too

601.44 --> 610.4590000000001
because the way it shot it's just this

604.76 --> 610.459
non-stop continual shot like

610.68 --> 616.56
there might be a total of like 20

613.32 --> 619.6800000000001
singular non-stop shots in the entire

616.56 --> 623.6999999999999
movie which is like two hours

619.68 --> 626.88
there's some crazy crazy shots but I

623.7 --> 630.6
know how they do it it has to be CGI but

626.88 --> 632.519
it is done so well

630.6 --> 634.62
because you basically just keep

632.519 --> 635.94
following them they're just walking and

634.62 --> 637.86
they're climbing and then they keep

635.94 --> 639.9590000000001
walking and they oh the field and then

637.86 --> 641.4590000000001
they they'd have a conversation while

639.959 --> 644.459
they're walking and you just keep

641.459 --> 647.88
following it's amazing

644.459 --> 652.8599999999999
you really get that feel

647.88 --> 656.519
for the trenches and and just the horror

652.86 --> 658.22
it's filled with like incredible Horrors

656.519 --> 660.839
like

658.22 --> 662.94
minor spoiler but basically like oh he's

660.839 --> 666.839
escaped and then he's swimming his way

662.94 --> 670.0790000000001
to safety and then he's like

666.839 --> 673.0790000000001
uh I can get out here out of the river

670.079 --> 674.6999999999999
here and then you basically zoom in and

673.079 --> 676.079
then you start to realize that he's

674.7 --> 679.38
basically

676.079 --> 682.26
trying to climb a bunch of dead bodies

679.38 --> 684.54
floating there of women which is like

682.26 --> 687.66
[ __ ]

684.54 --> 691.4399999999999
I mean the guys have does have amazing

687.66 --> 697.16
like insane PTSD and that is acted out

691.44 --> 697.1600000000001
like he is completely [ __ ] like

697.98 --> 705.5600000000001
from PTSD like at the end of the movie

700.38 --> 705.56
it is it's just so realistic like

707.339 --> 713.339
it's one of the most impressive

710.1 --> 716.519
movie like historical related movies

713.339 --> 719.22
from World War one that I've ever seen

716.519 --> 721.26
it's much more much more realistic than

719.22 --> 723.6600000000001
any World War II related movie I can

721.26 --> 726.54
tell you that

723.66 --> 729.48
fascinating really fascinating they put

726.54 --> 734.66
everything in there

729.48 --> 734.66
like those old weird tanks

734.7 --> 740.0400000000001
weird looking tanks those first types of

736.68 --> 744.1999999999999
tanks and dead horses places and just

740.04 --> 744.1999999999999
the trenches everywhere big creators

745.2 --> 747.98
ah

748.079 --> 752.06
heavy but

752.339 --> 757.8000000000001
like that movie is genuinely an

755.04 --> 758.9399999999999
experience I I recommend it just for

757.8 --> 763.92
that

758.94 --> 767.399
and I bet that people yeah the oldies

763.92 --> 769.74
will like they will get nervous by that

767.399 --> 772.5
movie because it's probably so realistic

769.74 --> 776.12
it will really remind them of

772.5 --> 776.12
of those world wars

777.42 --> 781.3199999999999
ah

778.8 --> 783.8599999999999
right anyway so that that's what I

781.32 --> 783.86
watched yesterday

783.92 --> 788.9399999999999
1970 is definitely one of if you're

786.959 --> 792.18
interested in history that's that's a

788.94 --> 794.339
good one to get a real feel for it I

792.18 --> 797.04
mean like Private Ryan wait you know

794.339 --> 800.94
everybody knows that movie Saving Pride

797.04 --> 803.399
Raven like that's like the feel what the

800.94 --> 805.44
we all got when we first saw that and

803.399 --> 808.139
and it's as in like wow yeah it's it's

805.44 --> 811.9200000000001
CGI too but it's like so realistic in

808.139 --> 814.32
ways and then Hollywood it up it's like

811.92 --> 816.42
still burgled up all that you know you

814.32 --> 818.22
can know that now but still that

816.42 --> 821.8199999999999
impressive like whoa It's really like

818.22 --> 824.639
you're there well they captured that and

821.82 --> 826.639
then made that the entire thing no more

824.639 --> 831.48
spielberging it up

826.639 --> 834.139
1970 has no spielberging it up at all

831.48 --> 834.139
at all

834.6 --> 842.1800000000001
it's just about the war it it yeah and

839.459 --> 842.18
what it was like

843.3 --> 846.62
and what the people were like

847.26 --> 851.8199999999999
it was really fascinating

849.3 --> 853.62
so if you like that that aspect of save

851.82 --> 856.0790000000001
it Friday Private Ryan but you didn't

853.62 --> 859.62
like the spielberging it up while the

856.079 --> 863.0
1917 is the movie for you

859.62 --> 863.0
you gotta check it out

864.5 --> 867.57
[Music]

877.2 --> 883.5600000000001
what the [ __ ] really

880.68 --> 885.7199999999999
I think you also watching yeah Dr Shiva

883.56 --> 887.399
yeah yeah yeah he was super late but I

885.72 --> 890.519
was in the comments there you picked up

887.399 --> 894.0
on that there that's that's amazing

890.519 --> 896.279
yeah he was talking with some uh

894.0 --> 898.98
chemtrail guy

896.279 --> 901.26
and they were really discussing it the

898.98 --> 904.339
Shiva wasn't like yeah yeah he was just

901.26 --> 907.38
like he had questions he was testing it

904.339 --> 909.6600000000001
the guy seemed a bit conspiratory at

907.38 --> 912.18
times and Shiva was really trying to

909.66 --> 915.3199999999999
like iron that out

912.18 --> 915.3199999999999
it's amazing to see

915.54 --> 921.42
and I had like a lot of my meteorology

918.079 --> 924.54
inputs I got all enthusiastic over the

921.42 --> 927.24
colloidal suspension how that works and

924.54 --> 929.88
like they're recently attained Advanced

927.24 --> 933.6800000000001
meteorology knowledge basically

929.88 --> 933.68
it's kind of bragging with that in chat

933.839 --> 938.5400000000001
but yeah yesterday was just very

939.12 --> 946.4590000000001
interesting night

942.42 --> 946.459
good movies Shiva stream

947.04 --> 952.68
also Paul Cook live streaming

950.04 --> 955.56
continually I don't report every live

952.68 --> 957.959
stream because he has a lot of them

955.56 --> 960.5999999999999
but he was around melta for like the

957.959 --> 963.3599999999999
last month or so showing all that

960.6 --> 966.839
amazing

963.36 --> 968.6990000000001
like cast stone stuff and all that and

966.839 --> 970.3800000000001
apparently he's been kicked out somehow

968.699 --> 973.3389999999999
I still don't understand how that

970.38 --> 977.22
happened when he's now in Egypt

973.339 --> 980.8800000000001
he basically ran off to Egypt

977.22 --> 983.279
I think from what I got he was told to

980.88 --> 985.62
leave in three days for some reason but

983.279 --> 987.18
I still don't understand why I'd have to

985.62 --> 990.44
probably watch one of the previous

987.18 --> 990.4399999999999
streams but that was weird

992.76 --> 997.279
I wonder what what happened

994.68 --> 997.279
uh

1000.38 --> 1007.3389999999999
right but I feel plenty inspired I could

1003.86 --> 1009.4590000000001
tackle some uh complicated things I

1007.339 --> 1009.4590000000001
think

1016.339 --> 1019.4200000000001
let's see what else

1021.32 --> 1024.3200000000002
uh

1024.439 --> 1029.1200000000001
there's all kinds of stuff still

1026.12 --> 1032.6599999999999
happening in the Netherlands as well

1029.12 --> 1035.4189999999999
the farmer Defense Force which is like

1032.66 --> 1036.8600000000001
well Farmers basically coming together

1035.419 --> 1039.38
to

1036.86 --> 1042.86
fight off the insane government

1039.38 --> 1046.64
Crackdown from wef agendas

1042.86 --> 1051.74
they're really making Headway they have

1046.64 --> 1053.8400000000001
they're like this BBB party

1051.74 --> 1056.1200000000001
which was supposedly there for the

1053.84 --> 1059.5
farmers and had that amazing rise

1056.12 --> 1063.1399999999999
well they are really getting exposed now

1059.5 --> 1066.88
for basically

1063.14 --> 1068.679
still going along with fed stuff

1066.88 --> 1071.6000000000001
Wes

1068.679 --> 1072.98
for going along with Wes again they're

1071.6 --> 1075.3999999999999
really [ __ ] up

1072.98 --> 1077.96
but like there were people that had

1075.4 --> 1081.38
called that out like hey they are have

1077.96 --> 1083.6000000000001
Monsanto related backgrounds and stuff

1081.38 --> 1085.88
and I called that out too when I picked

1083.6 --> 1088.539
up on that I was like oh

1085.88 --> 1088.5390000000002
but

1089.419 --> 1095.96
it seems like there's

1092.66 --> 1099.26
like the the farmers are metaphorically

1095.96 --> 1102.799
tilling the field and all this [ __ ] is

1099.26 --> 1104.419
all getting just exposed

1102.799 --> 1106.8799999999999
it's working

1104.419 --> 1109.039
I got real serious hopes for my country

1106.88 --> 1111.44
at this point and like in the comments

1109.039 --> 1114.32
too noticing other people are like

1111.44 --> 1117.799
feeling that as well

1114.32 --> 1120.74
like there may be like a serious

1117.799 --> 1123.3799999999999
Grassroots farmer

1120.74 --> 1127.76
political revolution happening so not

1123.38 --> 1131.0
like a demonstration type Revolution

1127.76 --> 1132.86
or something more violent but they're

1131.0 --> 1136.52
really doing stuff and they're getting

1132.86 --> 1138.32
involved with well

1136.52 --> 1140.08
uh

1138.32 --> 1143.059
indicting

1140.08 --> 1144.9189999999999
indicting the involved people

1143.059 --> 1148.3999999999999
this is all very fascinating it might

1144.919 --> 1149.7800000000002
take a while but it is happening

1148.4 --> 1152.3600000000001
and

1149.78 --> 1154.6
it's like we're gonna make it this feels

1152.36 --> 1154.6
like

1155.96 --> 1160.46
uh

1158.299 --> 1164.059
yeah you compare it to Star Wars it's

1160.46 --> 1167.38
like uh oh yeah the Death Star is coming

1164.059 --> 1167.3799999999999
but this time

1167.539 --> 1172.76
we got the plans literally we got the

1170.539 --> 1173.78
plans we know their plan we got their

1172.76 --> 1176.6
plan

1173.78 --> 1177.9189999999999
and yeah they're gonna blow us up they

1176.6 --> 1179.84
are already

1177.919 --> 1182.72
attempting to blow us up through the

1179.84 --> 1185.32
bureaucracy but now there is a actual

1182.72 --> 1185.32
resistance

1185.48 --> 1191.84
and and we're about to basically

1189.919 --> 1193.76
yeah there is a text back and we're

1191.84 --> 1196.22
getting to the point where Luke is about

1193.76 --> 1198.94
to drop the uh

1196.22 --> 1198.94
is it

1198.98 --> 1204.44
the guided ion uh missile or whatever

1202.52 --> 1206.9
they call it

1204.44 --> 1208.46
Photon torpedo

1206.9 --> 1209.539
what the hell did they call it I don't

1208.46 --> 1212.66
remember

1209.539 --> 1214.039
right it feels like that is what it will

1212.66 --> 1217.46
happen

1214.039 --> 1219.62
we're not just gonna get blown up

1217.46 --> 1222.14
I can feel it

1219.62 --> 1225.6789999999999
I'm glad I by the way I did call this

1222.14 --> 1227.6000000000001
guys I did call 2023 like there's a lot

1225.679 --> 1230.14
of stuff gonna happen like it's make or

1227.6 --> 1230.1399999999999
break here

1231.38 --> 1235.7600000000002
and it's also the year where they're

1233.12 --> 1239.059
gonna attempt where they were or are

1235.76 --> 1241.28
attempting to Ram through the 15-minute

1239.059 --> 1244.16
City very quickly like they ran through

1241.28 --> 1246.62
Corona they're gonna try to trick us

1244.16 --> 1248.78
into that Ram it through the plans are

1246.62 --> 1251.7199999999998
already on the table

1248.78 --> 1255.1399999999999
but it's gonna fail miserably like it's

1251.72 --> 1258.44
all been discovered like

1255.14 --> 1261.5
it's no more conspiracy theory like the

1258.44 --> 1264.14
plans are out there like the public

1261.5 --> 1266.24
just has the plans

1264.14 --> 1268.539
you can't tell us anymore that we made

1266.24 --> 1268.539
it up

1276.98 --> 1281.419
the depth star yeah

1279.2 --> 1284.0
right the Death Star it was gonna blow

1281.419 --> 1287.0800000000002
up the the rebel base

1284.0 --> 1287.08
getting in position

1288.26 --> 1293.9
but we have their plans

1291.38 --> 1298.7
and we know their weakness

1293.9 --> 1301.88
and they are engaged like the

1298.7 --> 1304.159
the Thai fighters have already lifted

1301.88 --> 1306.679
off they are on their way

1304.159 --> 1308.96
and with the plant they are going to

1306.679 --> 1312.22
blow up that Death Star

1308.96 --> 1312.22
that's where we are now

1312.62 --> 1316.6
YouTube keeps freezing up on me

1318.38 --> 1321.0390000000002
weird

1321.679 --> 1327.02
anybody else having YouTube freezing up

1324.14 --> 1328.5200000000002
issues it's gone with refreshing but

1327.02 --> 1329.4189999999999
this just keeps happening all of a

1328.52 --> 1332.9189999999999
sudden

1329.419 --> 1332.919
weird since yesterday

1335.12 --> 1338.26
hey steamy Traveler

1344.299 --> 1347.86
oh okay

1354.26 --> 1361.1
I'm sure he's enjoying it a lot

1357.26 --> 1363.799
me raging against my audience

1361.1 --> 1366.5
yeah because I don't like to go hungry

1363.799 --> 1369.76
but it worked

1366.5 --> 1369.76
people got the message

1370.7 --> 1375.74
and they know the deal I just have to

1373.159 --> 1377.7800000000002
remind them of that unpleasant side of

1375.74 --> 1379.159
my channel

1377.78 --> 1381.9189999999999
right

1379.159 --> 1384.44
that is all

1381.919 --> 1387.8600000000001
chat freezes up constantly now to chat

1384.44 --> 1391.1000000000001
too okay I haven't noticed that

1387.86 --> 1394.039
I'm just noticing that

1391.1 --> 1396.08
the video screen froze up

1394.039 --> 1397.8799999999999
does the sound freeze up for you guys

1396.08 --> 1401.74
too when that happens I can't tell

1397.88 --> 1401.74
because it's on mute here

1416.12 --> 1422.02
blowing your pyrola what does that mean

1419.539 --> 1422.02
to it

1422.36 --> 1425.02
it's weird

1429.919 --> 1436.46
sound doesn't freeze up okay good well

1432.32 --> 1438.6399999999999
that's I guess the most important part

1436.46 --> 1438.64
foreign

1447.679 --> 1450.76
weather's so great

1454.7 --> 1460.94
this is like a pristine summer day

1457.82 --> 1465.1
must be a real blast at the ocean right

1460.94 --> 1465.1000000000001
now it's probably really crowded

1466.7 --> 1471.7
although there are a lot of people going

1468.679 --> 1471.7
back to work as well

1485.539 --> 1488.539
oh

1491.12 --> 1495.86
the pyrola virus that's the new

1493.7 --> 1498.64
narrative I hadn't even picked up on it

1495.86 --> 1498.6399999999999
it's just that

1499.72 --> 1505.94
to me it's like oh the new Harry Potter

1502.7 --> 1508.4
book came out oh look it's so popular

1505.94 --> 1514.88
everybody knows about the new Harry

1508.4 --> 1518.02
Potter book and I'm like it's just some

1514.88 --> 1518.0200000000002
fiction stuff

1519.26 --> 1525.86
so the new virus yeah whatever man

1522.44 --> 1529.3400000000001
like viruses don't actually exist

1525.86 --> 1533.26
so I'd love to see

1529.34 --> 1533.26
the actual procedure

1533.36 --> 1538.76
with the

1535.24 --> 1540.799
microscope footage that led to the

1538.76 --> 1543.44
conclusion that it's a new virus yeah

1540.799 --> 1545.6
I'd like to see I wonder if they even

1543.44 --> 1548.96
did anything

1545.6 --> 1550.34
if they edit actual laboratory stuff

1548.96 --> 1554.419
even

1550.34 --> 1558.1399999999999
or if they just made it up it's like oh

1554.419 --> 1560.779
the new virus it's going to be prairola

1558.14 --> 1563.24
and that's it that they they didn't even

1560.779 --> 1564.799
have a bunch of Stooges [ __ ] around with

1563.24 --> 1567.38
laboratory stuff

1564.799 --> 1569.179
did they even do that I doubt it I doubt

1567.38 --> 1572.0
that they still even do that like it's

1569.179 --> 1574.46
like they just don't really care anymore

1572.0 --> 1576.26
they just want the control and they'll

1574.46 --> 1580.779
make it up and

1576.26 --> 1580.779
yeah they'll barely take it serious

1581.539 --> 1583.82
they're rushing

1582.46 --> 1586.52
[Music]

1583.82 --> 1588.9189999999999
they just make it up yeah

1586.52 --> 1592.1
there is no

1588.919 --> 1595.4
no Labyrinth that's like oh my God guys

1592.1 --> 1598.059
I found the new virus oh really where

1595.4 --> 1598.0590000000002
where is that

1598.47 --> 1603.799
[Music]

1600.32 --> 1605.36
where's that article like oh this is the

1603.799 --> 1610.1
laboratory

1605.36 --> 1613.279
where the new virus was isolated this is

1610.1 --> 1616.1
where they got the sample from and

1613.279 --> 1618.62
where where where where is that oh

1616.1 --> 1622.0
that's not even there it doesn't even

1618.62 --> 1624.6789999999999
exist right I mean the supposed

1622.0 --> 1626.72
coronavirus had a whole background stuff

1624.679 --> 1630.2
story to it right

1626.72 --> 1633.5
that supposedly some group allegedly

1630.2 --> 1636.74
said like it's a Wuhan lab thing and

1633.5 --> 1638.179
then others say but no wait you can

1636.74 --> 1641.48
actually trace it back to some

1638.179 --> 1644.659
California lab and I don't know how it's

1641.48 --> 1647.059
like they have a back story as to where

1644.659 --> 1649.22
it was supposedly found and done stuff

1647.059 --> 1651.44
done with it yeah

1649.22 --> 1652.88
so what's the background story on this

1651.44 --> 1656.24
one

1652.88 --> 1658.3400000000001
do they even have one or did it just

1656.24 --> 1662.059
roll out of the printer it's like oh

1658.34 --> 1665.3799999999999
this is the new one oh okay this is it's

1662.059 --> 1665.3799999999999
there really

1685.84 --> 1694.0
what about rabies well rabies I think is

1690.62 --> 1694.0
actually like a parasite

1698.98 --> 1706.82
that's in the saliva it's like uh

1703.039 --> 1709.34
syphilis right syphilis also parasites

1706.82 --> 1714.26
are real they are like microorganisms

1709.34 --> 1714.26
some multicellular microorganisms

1719.299 --> 1726.32
that transfer themselves through fluids

1723.2 --> 1729.559
right that exists

1726.32 --> 1734.6
both of them actually eat the brain

1729.559 --> 1734.6
that's how they are so dangerous right

1738.08 --> 1741.58
syphilis and rabies

1751.38 --> 1754.449
[Music]

1759.5 --> 1767.799
they got patents on the viruses strange

1762.559 --> 1771.46
you mean strain and that's strangeness

1767.799 --> 1771.46
I'm sure they do

1779.48 --> 1785.659
maybe it's just a strain that they got

1782.84 --> 1788.62
out of laboratory work like decades ago

1785.659 --> 1788.6200000000001
who knows

1788.72 --> 1793.1000000000001
so dear Patriot you got some actual

1791.179 --> 1794.539
background information

1793.1 --> 1798.08
then

1794.539 --> 1800.84
you seem to know that they have patterns

1798.08 --> 1804.46
and all that so does that mean there is

1800.84 --> 1804.4599999999998
background information available

1807.039 --> 1815.3799999999999
or did they just say or you just assume

1811.52 --> 1815.3799999999999
they have Pat ents on it

1817.64 --> 1823.8200000000002
how do you know

1820.22 --> 1829.1200000000001
I mean it's likely they got patterns on

1823.82 --> 1829.12
on the new vaccines and stuff but

1829.58 --> 1833.779
how do you know

1831.14 --> 1836.98
where are you getting this info from

1833.779 --> 1836.98
their Patriot

1837.23 --> 1840.38
[Music]

1849.08 --> 1854.98
oh by the way hello seeking star water

1851.539 --> 1854.98
and logical conclusion

1856.22 --> 1860.38
oh logical observations I mean

1862.54 --> 1865.6399999999999
[Music]

1867.08 --> 1872.1789999999999
the rabies vaccine helpful

1870.24 --> 1873.799
[Music]

1872.179 --> 1878.2
I doubt it

1873.799 --> 1878.2
but I mean rabies can be cured

1881.779 --> 1886.36
I don't really believe in vaccination

1884.0 --> 1886.36
anymore

1891.98 --> 1896.659
I mean it might work

1894.14 --> 1898.64
I don't know I don't even know if like

1896.659 --> 1901.72
vaccination even works with like

1898.64 --> 1901.72
parasites like that

1904.76 --> 1907.419
I mean

1907.58 --> 1910.1789999999999
Maybe

1911.179 --> 1916.94
but it would just like you just

1913.82 --> 1919.72
if the parasite wouldn't be properly

1916.94 --> 1919.72
weakened

1920.059 --> 1925.1589999999999
then yeah you'd just be infecting

1922.159 --> 1928.5800000000002
yourself with the parasite

1925.159 --> 1931.7600000000002
so and I think that both could just

1928.58 --> 1933.9189999999999
blatantly be cured so why would you need

1931.76 --> 1935.96
to have some

1933.919 --> 1938.0800000000002
I mean just take the freaking cure with

1935.96 --> 1938.08
you

1938.299 --> 1942.98
if you're that nervous about it

1941.179 --> 1946.24
right

1942.98 --> 1946.24
let's take a dose with you

1951.62 --> 1956.4189999999999
isn't that the one they give you a bunch

1954.14 --> 1958.8990000000001
of shots in the abdomen really that's

1956.419 --> 1958.8990000000001
[ __ ] up

1963.14 --> 1969.279
patent on exercise isn't a big deal

1965.659 --> 1969.279
because it's just that cell material

1972.14 --> 1977.7990000000002
well an extra some isn't really just

1974.419 --> 1977.7990000000002
that cell material is it

1979.279 --> 1986.02
like an active

1981.86 --> 1986.02
chemical component that does something

1987.62 --> 1992.02
so it's not dead it's either unliving

1994.88 --> 1998.72
yeah it's mostly it's mechanical and

1996.919 --> 2002.1000000000001
living it's just

1998.72 --> 2002.1000000000001
protein mechanism

2002.86 --> 2008.4399999999998
supposedly right but what they even what

2005.799 --> 2011.3799999999999
they show the supposed picture of a

2008.44 --> 2013.48
virus yeah that's just a glob of that

2011.38 --> 2016.0590000000002
cell debris

2013.48 --> 2020.08
that doesn't mean that exosomes are not

2016.059 --> 2022.74
don't exist necessarily they might very

2020.08 --> 2022.74
well exist

2034.0 --> 2039.34
Jesus

2035.62 --> 2041.76
tetanus and anti-rabity that's just

2039.34 --> 2041.76
[ __ ] up

2043.899 --> 2047.6789999999999
I mean I don't even understand how

2046.179 --> 2052.44
that's supposed to help

2047.679 --> 2052.44
then just really suspect

2058.06 --> 2062.2
oh oh speaking star water yeah yeah no

2060.82 --> 2064.48
no no no

2062.2 --> 2066.399
it's better seeking star water than that

2064.48 --> 2068.919
yeah you say no virus has ever been

2066.399 --> 2071.08
shown to replicate nor be alive but it's

2068.919 --> 2073.24
not claim to be alive

2071.08 --> 2075.0989999999997
but here's the funnier part

2073.24 --> 2080.3199999999997
no virus

2075.099 --> 2082.839
has ever been proven to actually cause

2080.32 --> 2085.7200000000003
the disease

2082.839 --> 2089.32
through cost postulate

2085.72 --> 2092.02
nobody is ever like yeah let's isolate

2089.32 --> 2093.339
those what we think is the virus

2092.02 --> 2096.7
particles

2093.339 --> 2099.46
clean them up all the junk

2096.7 --> 2101.6189999999997
all the poison stuff or whatever how we

2099.46 --> 2103.96
how we isolated them oh get them out

2101.619 --> 2107.92
until you just got only those like

2103.96 --> 2110.32
concentrated viral particle right

2107.92 --> 2113.8
and maybe water say like water or

2110.32 --> 2116.7400000000002
something whatever they need to

2113.8 --> 2119.7400000000002
to add to it

2116.74 --> 2122.6189999999997
and only that like no

2119.74 --> 2125.0789999999997
typical like not the cell debris that

2122.619 --> 2129.76
what's around it not other talks just

2125.079 --> 2132.82
the supposed virus particle and then

2129.76 --> 2136.119
solve it in saline water or whatever

2132.82 --> 2138.78
so that is kept cohesive and then you

2136.119 --> 2138.78
inject that

2140.26 --> 2146.6800000000003
will the person get

2143.26 --> 2150.5400000000004
the claimed disease

2146.68 --> 2150.54
I highly doubt it

2150.76 --> 2156.4
I highly highly doubt that that can as

2153.94 --> 2160.02
ever even been tested with it

2156.4 --> 2160.02
and it's known not to happen

2162.88 --> 2168.76
because those particles don't actually

2166.06 --> 2171.22
cause the disease it's never even been

2168.76 --> 2174.0
scientifically tested

2171.22 --> 2176.7999999999997
the earliest oldest tests

2174.0 --> 2179.14
were cause postulate

2176.8 --> 2182.92
and there's great suspicion and some

2179.14 --> 2186.4
proof that he actually committed fraud

2182.92 --> 2188.079
with his own test like the postulate was

2186.4 --> 2190.0
brilliant

2188.079 --> 2193.3
but then

2190.0 --> 2195.76
there was fraud and basically it's

2193.3 --> 2198.88
messed up on purpose

2195.76 --> 2202.119
they didn't isolate

2198.88 --> 2205.7400000000002
the independent variable properly they

2202.119 --> 2205.7400000000002
added in the goo

2206.859 --> 2210.46
right they didn't isolate the the

2209.32 --> 2212.7400000000002
particle

2210.46 --> 2217.18
they never did that they added the goo

2212.74 --> 2221.0789999999997
they injected like dead rotting material

2217.18 --> 2225.7799999999997
that rotting soup really [ __ ] up gross

2221.079 --> 2225.78
[ __ ] that's what they added

2225.94 --> 2230.619
and then oh yeah oh wow it's causing the

2228.52 --> 2234.04
disease oh really

2230.619 --> 2236.44
when you take rotting this like

2234.04 --> 2239.44
basically rotting mummy juice something

2236.44 --> 2242.2000000000003
really [ __ ] up a totally sick person

2239.44 --> 2244.48
that's like super gross or that's

2242.2 --> 2246.46
already dead from and you take just the

2244.48 --> 2249.76
goo off that and you inject it and you

2246.46 --> 2252.16
get sick really you get sick from that

2249.76 --> 2254.5600000000004
you think

2252.16 --> 2258.04
holy [ __ ] yeah yeah that's because it's

2254.56 --> 2260.0789999999997
just gigantic amount of toxic crap

2258.04 --> 2263.14
yeah that's not

2260.079 --> 2265.3
that unit

2263.14 --> 2267.339
that's supposedly the cause that's been

2265.3 --> 2269.8590000000004
isolated

2267.339 --> 2272.98
that's been injected because if that's

2269.859 --> 2275.0789999999997
been would have done that then nothing

2272.98 --> 2277.7400000000002
happens

2275.079 --> 2279.76
yeah those things

2277.74 --> 2281.2
bacteria then

2279.76 --> 2282.94
that's where it started with cost

2281.2 --> 2285.04
washing the pack of decade area that you

2282.94 --> 2287.56
could actually see regularly on the

2285.04 --> 2289.54
microscope even when you didn't prepare

2287.56 --> 2291.64
anything you just put stuff in between

2289.54 --> 2294.72
there you see bacteria

2291.64 --> 2299.44
yeah those are real

2294.72 --> 2301.7799999999997
moving things they are living arguably

2299.44 --> 2303.339
well if you isolate those you put them

2301.78 --> 2305.7400000000002
in your body

2303.339 --> 2308.74
it doesn't really do that much you know

2305.74 --> 2310.72
why because well not because all the

2308.74 --> 2312.4599999999996
body immediately attacks them and blah

2310.72 --> 2314.0789999999997
no no it's because they don't actually

2312.46 --> 2316.839
cause the disease

2314.079 --> 2318.88
they just come around

2316.839 --> 2321.04
when such a disease is happening because

2318.88 --> 2323.1400000000003
they are typically the cleanup crew for

2321.04 --> 2326.44
that type of situation

2323.14 --> 2328.48
so it's correlation not causation and

2326.44 --> 2330.64
yeah you inject that in the body that's

2328.48 --> 2334.3
just perfectly healthy they will just

2330.64 --> 2336.8799999999997
immediately be turned off transformed

2334.3 --> 2338.8590000000004
because yeah bacteria transform is

2336.88 --> 2341.56
really freaking weird

2338.859 --> 2343.2999999999997
it's crazy it still blows my mind it's

2341.56 --> 2344.619
very little talked about but this is

2343.3 --> 2346.96
established

2344.619 --> 2349.2400000000002
very early in the 20th century I think

2346.96 --> 2354.2200000000003
or was it late 90th Century even

2349.24 --> 2357.52
with microscopes that bacteria can be

2354.22 --> 2359.7999999999997
made to transform and this has been

2357.52 --> 2362.92
visually recorded

2359.8 --> 2365.02
transform like under a microscope you

2362.92 --> 2367.48
have to microscope on it they subject

2365.02 --> 2368.44
certain things to it or they shock it or

2367.48 --> 2372.579
something

2368.44 --> 2375.9
and then it changes from a bacteria to A

2372.579 --> 2375.9
fungi Spore

2376.119 --> 2383.1400000000003
to a blood platelet

2380.56 --> 2385.119
and back to a bacteria

2383.14 --> 2387.54
yeah

2385.119 --> 2387.54
yeah yeah

2388.48 --> 2394.8
the entire medical ideas

2391.56 --> 2400.5
just allopathy I just

2394.8 --> 2403.119
boom it's all gone it's all gone

2400.5 --> 2405.88
allopathic thinking bacteria it's all

2403.119 --> 2407.32
gone and it was gone before it even was

2405.88 --> 2409.26
invented

2407.32 --> 2412.839
yeah

2409.26 --> 2416.98
bacteria blood platelets the red blood

2412.839 --> 2419.98
platelets yeah fungi they are all the

2416.98 --> 2423.46
same units they transform in your body

2419.98 --> 2426.16
your body controls that process it's all

2423.46 --> 2429.64
part of your body it's crazy

2426.16 --> 2431.92
you can assimilate bacteria from the

2429.64 --> 2434.3799999999997
outside and transform them into other

2431.92 --> 2438.3
units like blood platelets like what the

2434.38 --> 2438.3
[ __ ] what the [ __ ]

2438.52 --> 2441.7599999999998
okay

2440.02 --> 2443.859
yeah they don't tell you that in medical

2441.76 --> 2445.78
school or while they they mention that

2443.859 --> 2447.5789999999997
and then they like forget that ever

2445.78 --> 2450.52
happened because they can't fit that in

2447.579 --> 2452.619
anything it's crazy

2450.52 --> 2455.859
the can't be of their concern because

2452.619 --> 2458.079
then their angle of approach for

2455.859 --> 2462.2999999999997
research just doesn't make sense at all

2458.079 --> 2462.3
none of it does and it doesn't

2466.839 --> 2472.359
is so bizarre right so yeah what do you

2470.44 --> 2474.7000000000003
do you insert bacteria oh they're going

2472.359 --> 2477.16
to cause you disease and it's just like

2474.7 --> 2480.339
oh thanks body's probably gonna be like

2477.16 --> 2482.3799999999997
what's that something unexpectedly

2480.339 --> 2484.18
enters and then it's like yeah you might

2482.38 --> 2486.1600000000003
get a little bit uncomfortable you might

2484.18 --> 2487.839
get some organs that are like oh they're

2486.16 --> 2488.859
gonna do something in response and then

2487.839 --> 2492.2799999999997
it's like

2488.859 --> 2494.02
oh yeah it's fine just back to normal

2492.28 --> 2497.38
it's like oh yeah

2494.02 --> 2499.0
the new insert has been tackled shock

2497.38 --> 2501.4
response because it was all of a sudden

2499.0 --> 2503.26
injections always get that you inject

2501.4 --> 2505.54
something that's like an unexpected

2503.26 --> 2507.46
entry body's gonna have a response

2505.54 --> 2511.119
because it's bypassing all the security

2507.46 --> 2514.06
right your digestive system your skin

2511.119 --> 2516.28
it's all security it's City security

2514.06 --> 2519.16
you're like a city a giant City a

2516.28 --> 2521.32
Metropole with all this activity and

2519.16 --> 2523.6189999999997
your skin and your digestive system are

2521.32 --> 2523.619
security

2523.9 --> 2528.339
like the wall security

2526.42 --> 2531.16
and like

2528.339 --> 2534.099
procedure if you want to become part of

2531.16 --> 2535.7799999999997
this country this city you have to go

2534.099 --> 2537.579
through the digestive systems a long

2535.78 --> 2539.38
procedure you have to go through all

2537.579 --> 2541.42
these things and then eventually you can

2539.38 --> 2543.6400000000003
become part of the body right that's how

2541.42 --> 2546.82
you could see it

2543.64 --> 2549.96
so yeah cost flashlight never applied to

2546.82 --> 2549.96
any of this virus stuff

2550.3 --> 2556.3
it's they just go with yeah we just are

2554.079 --> 2559.8390000000004
gonna just presuppose

2556.3 --> 2564.579
viruses there if there's even a thing

2559.839 --> 2565.72
probably not and bacteria just cause the

2564.579 --> 2567.76
disease

2565.72 --> 2570.22
but we're not gonna apply cost partially

2567.76 --> 2572.26
we're just gonna assume that because we

2570.22 --> 2575.5
keep popping up and

2572.26 --> 2578.98
we're just conveniently get everybody

2575.5 --> 2583.0
used to overlooking that hey maybe that

2578.98 --> 2586.2400000000002
original basic idea of uh correlation is

2583.0 --> 2588.88
not causation anyone yeah let's let's

2586.24 --> 2590.7999999999997
forget about that and just oh we have to

2588.88 --> 2593.7400000000002
trust the literature they said it was

2590.8 --> 2596.8590000000004
like this a hundred years ago

2593.74 --> 2598.839
I mean could couldn't have been fraud or

2596.859 --> 2600.88
anything that's not actually try to

2598.839 --> 2603.04
repeat the experiment like a proper

2600.88 --> 2605.319
scientist yeah let's not know we're just

2603.04 --> 2609.64
gonna trust the literature yeah because

2605.319 --> 2611.2
because uh well if I get too nosy then I

2609.64 --> 2613.2999999999997
lose my paycheck

2611.2 --> 2615.46
right

2613.3 --> 2618.099
and such a great paycheck being in the

2615.46 --> 2620.64
medical industry so you can't ask too

2618.099 --> 2620.6400000000003
many questions

2630.339 --> 2639.119
right so yeah apparently supposedly new

2634.72 --> 2639.1189999999997
virus whatever I don't think they exist

2647.2 --> 2649.2
s

2660.28 --> 2665.079
let's all be nonsense none of these

2662.92 --> 2667.38
historical figures actually exit how do

2665.079 --> 2667.38
you know

2667.48 --> 2672.7
I think some math

2669.76 --> 2673.9
but there are figures and this is really

2672.7 --> 2676.1189999999997
interesting

2673.9 --> 2678.1600000000003
through that I did anybody watch the

2676.119 --> 2681.52
video by the way from mine unveil that I

2678.16 --> 2685.48
linked up yesterday I watched it again

2681.52 --> 2689.92
it's really revealing

2685.48 --> 2694.079
and shocking like really heavy

2689.92 --> 2694.079
because it suddenly gives

2694.56 --> 2701.859
a realistic

2697.599 --> 2704.5
reason for certain mythology it's very

2701.859 --> 2706.06
shocking like jarring

2704.5 --> 2708.64
like

2706.06 --> 2709.599
you'll have a very serious atheist

2708.64 --> 2711.7599999999998
moment

2709.599 --> 2712.9
for a moment because of it

2711.76 --> 2716.44
but

2712.9 --> 2718.2400000000002
logic will always basically prove that

2716.44 --> 2720.16
God has to exist because of the

2718.24 --> 2722.56
ontological primitive

2720.16 --> 2724.48
so it doesn't matter like what

2722.56 --> 2726.94
everything turned out to be

2724.48 --> 2729.28
and why it is there that maybe all of

2726.94 --> 2732.7000000000003
Mythology might simply be there to cover

2729.28 --> 2734.8
for to occult ties serious technology

2732.7 --> 2736.359
that's like too dangerous to be

2734.8 --> 2739.0600000000004
understood

2736.359 --> 2740.319
so then they translate that into divine

2739.06 --> 2742.2999999999997
intervention because it's so

2740.319 --> 2744.579
overwhelming when they actually used it

2742.3 --> 2746.6800000000003
that people would think like oh this is

2744.579 --> 2750.28
God ending the world anyway

2746.68 --> 2753.52
so they just use that psychological

2750.28 --> 2755.2000000000003
response and as a cover story like it is

2753.52 --> 2757.96
really that

2755.2 --> 2760.4399999999996
it's very shocking very very shocking

2757.96 --> 2760.44
that video

2760.56 --> 2766.74
hmm

2762.9 --> 2766.7400000000002
did anybody check it out

2767.02 --> 2770.7
do I need to link it up again

2783.64 --> 2787.0789999999997
there we go this is the one

2796.0 --> 2799.14
what's going on here

2801.339 --> 2806.92
Napoleon Bonaparte was fake

2803.92 --> 2806.92
uh

2809.98 --> 2814.599
um no

2811.96 --> 2817.48
probably not

2814.599 --> 2819.52
now was

2817.48 --> 2823.0
his

2819.52 --> 2823.0
story Rewritten

2823.06 --> 2830.2599999999998
probably

2825.46 --> 2832.78
right Victors usually end up rewriting

2830.26 --> 2835.3
their own story when they win

2832.78 --> 2839.26
because they probably had to do a bunch

2835.3 --> 2841.96
of really [ __ ] up ugly [ __ ] and

2839.26 --> 2845.3390000000004
made mistakes that they definitely don't

2841.96 --> 2845.339
want everybody to know about

2846.339 --> 2853.359
so if there's like historical victors

2850.18 --> 2855.46
then you must realize that they had

2853.359 --> 2858.7
because they won they probably had the

2855.46 --> 2861.819
opportunity to rewrite

2858.7 --> 2863.2
at least a little if not everything that

2861.819 --> 2865.48
they did

2863.2 --> 2868.5989999999997
you always have to keep that in mind

2865.48 --> 2872.14
that it it will always happen

2868.599 --> 2874.48
because getting absolute power will just

2872.14 --> 2876.8799999999997
be always [ __ ] up it's always going to

2874.48 --> 2879.579
be [ __ ] up you're always gonna have

2876.88 --> 2882.6400000000003
like monstrous [ __ ]

2879.579 --> 2885.579
that's that you had to do somehow it

2882.64 --> 2888.7
just always happens like that

2885.579 --> 2892.48
and you don't want that as part of your

2888.7 --> 2894.7599999999998
legacy as how people think of you so the

2892.48 --> 2897.64
victors always going to end up rewriting

2894.76 --> 2901.96
history and you always have to keep that

2897.64 --> 2902.7
in mind when you read history

2901.96 --> 2904.119
thank you

2902.7 --> 2907.1189999999997
[Music]

2904.119 --> 2907.119
foreign

2911.619 --> 2915.54
you can only give guesses

2935.619 --> 2940.42
in their storytelling yeah no that's no

2937.96 --> 2941.68
but they do do that Terry of course they

2940.42 --> 2943.0
do that

2941.68 --> 2945.16
like

2943.0 --> 2948.76
I felt strong suspicion with Nikola

2945.16 --> 2950.2
Tesla that he's actually a plant

2948.76 --> 2953.3190000000004
that he's

2950.2 --> 2956.2599999999998
it's like a stereotypical scenario like

2953.319 --> 2957.579
the poor brilliant guy it's a bit

2956.26 --> 2959.92
autistic

2957.579 --> 2962.38
that's just been capped down by the

2959.92 --> 2964.359
system and capped down by the oligarchy

2962.38 --> 2966.52
that we're taking up like it's such a

2964.359 --> 2970.14
stereotypical scenario for the entire

2966.52 --> 2970.14
thing I find it

2970.9 --> 2975.46
when I was younger I totally bought it

2973.0 --> 2978.579
now that I'm a bit older I have strong

2975.46 --> 2982.079
doubts about Nikola Tesla the story

2978.579 --> 2985.8390000000004
about him strong outs

2982.079 --> 2989.94
not doubts about the legitimacy of the

2985.839 --> 2989.94
actual research but his background story

3001.44 --> 3004.46
Stephen Hawkins

3005.94 --> 3013.02
yeah yeah maybe maybe maybe they got to

3009.78 --> 3016.3190000000004
him it's like there's a good chance that

3013.02 --> 3017.46
Tesla just figured out like unbelievable

3016.319 --> 3021.66
attack

3017.46 --> 3025.56
probably beyond the old antiqua Tech

3021.66 --> 3028.98
like the like super wdw weapons that

3025.56 --> 3032.22
were used to torch cities by the Romans

3028.98 --> 3034.8
right or the Phoenicians are guildley

3032.22 --> 3037.68
they were probably Phoenicians big ships

3034.8 --> 3039.54
with gigantic parabolic mirrors it's

3037.68 --> 3042.359
like a ship

3039.54 --> 3044.04
that is just this giant

3042.359 --> 3046.319
laser

3044.04 --> 3049.92
and they would just burn an entire city

3046.319 --> 3051.5589999999997
from at a distance at a bright day

3049.92 --> 3054.0
totally crazy

3051.559 --> 3056.88
and that's probably what ended up

3054.0 --> 3060.24
creating so much Devastation like all

3056.88 --> 3062.7200000000003
these melted castles and [ __ ] around

3060.24 --> 3065.04
it was probably

3062.72 --> 3067.98
gigantic like

3065.04 --> 3073.2799999999997
parabolic mirror type

3067.98 --> 3076.2
d w d w d e w

3073.28 --> 3078.78
right that's what you get from that link

3076.2 --> 3081.2999999999997
watch the link watch the freaking link

3078.78 --> 3083.76
let it sink watch the link let it sink

3081.3 --> 3085.5
watch the link let it sink told you

3083.76 --> 3087.599
yesterday

3085.5 --> 3090.18
I'm surprised you're not all yapping

3087.599 --> 3093.2400000000002
about it because that's like one of the

3090.18 --> 3095.7799999999997
more impactful videos that I've seen

3093.24 --> 3095.7799999999997
this month

3097.76 --> 3102.079
implications are staggering

3113.16 --> 3118.7999999999997
yeah can you imagine

3116.22 --> 3121.14
it's like oh you got the centurions and

3118.8 --> 3123.2400000000002
you got this and that and and then

3121.14 --> 3126.66
there's just this [ __ ]

3123.24 --> 3130.319
and the ship is like as a giant mirror

3126.66 --> 3133.14
on it and they it's basically I mean

3130.319 --> 3134.96
that's almost like Dune like scenarios

3133.14 --> 3139.14
right Dune

3134.96 --> 3142.079
arrakis the spice it's like yeah a bunch

3139.14 --> 3145.46
of Swords Shield stuff and then just the

3142.079 --> 3145.46
ship comes and it's just like

3146.599 --> 3153.44
but everything just goes aflame like

3150.54 --> 3153.44
this beam just

3154.02 --> 3160.5
just Burns Burns Burns the entire city

3158.22 --> 3163.5789999999997
sitting on a boat

3160.5 --> 3163.579
totally crazy

3170.4 --> 3173.94
damn it

3171.72 --> 3177.14
YouTube just keeps freezing up almost

3173.94 --> 3177.14
like every 10 seconds

3177.54 --> 3181.46
on YouTube stop messing around

3187.68 --> 3195.5
got a few hours in the night to game

3191.339 --> 3199.7
oh my God gaming it's so important

3195.5 --> 3199.7
whatever it's your life

3207.839 --> 3212.46
Isaac Newton did next no Newton

3210.0 --> 3213.66
definitely did exist he had so much

3212.46 --> 3216.92
involvement

3213.66 --> 3216.92
and what was going on

3218.22 --> 3225.72
like the more people are entangled

3222.359 --> 3227.7
and concerned it's about what they're

3225.72 --> 3231.18
concerned with if people are really

3227.7 --> 3233.819
concerned with contemporary

3231.18 --> 3235.5589999999997
debates or issues like oh this is

3233.819 --> 3237.18
happening this is what they're saying I

3235.559 --> 3237.96
don't think about I think about it like

3237.18 --> 3241.7999999999997
this

3237.96 --> 3244.14
that is like a strong indicator

3241.8 --> 3246.78
that they probably were real people if

3244.14 --> 3249.839
they have involvements

3246.78 --> 3252.02
with what was provably happening at the

3249.839 --> 3252.02
time

3252.9 --> 3258.0
now if they just oh I'm I'm special I'm

3256.079 --> 3260.579
doing my own thing and they don't seem

3258.0 --> 3262.44
to really involve themselves much with

3260.579 --> 3265.1400000000003
communication or whatever with other

3262.44 --> 3267.66
people of the time or with issues that

3265.14 --> 3269.64
were playing out at the time that makes

3267.66 --> 3273.7999999999997
the chances that they were completely

3269.64 --> 3273.7999999999997
made up characters a lot higher

3280.76 --> 3284.94
[Music]

3281.9 --> 3288.359
right that they were there as a cover

3284.94 --> 3290.28
story for something that was being kept

3288.359 --> 3292.5589999999997
secret for a long time and now oh now

3290.28 --> 3295.4
this guy invents it and then it's like

3292.559 --> 3295.4
put back in the model

3295.559 --> 3302.579
it's like

3298.02 --> 3304.559
yeah like revealing we we got this

3302.579 --> 3306.92
like they have to still tell you what

3304.559 --> 3306.92
they got

3306.96 --> 3312.96
but then make you lose interest or make

3310.14 --> 3315.2999999999997
it seem like it's all buried in the past

3312.96 --> 3319.02
right it's like oh Tesla had all this

3315.3 --> 3320.94
amazing Tech but like people don't

3319.02 --> 3324.9
really understood it and he's dead now

3320.94 --> 3328.14
so we don't really like it's lost

3324.9 --> 3331.579
the his amazing insights were lost when

3328.14 --> 3333.96
he died that kind of idea right

3331.579 --> 3335.7000000000003
that's what they kind of want you to

3333.96 --> 3339.599
think about it

3335.7 --> 3344.04
but if he was basically a guy that

3339.599 --> 3347.579
was just like developing the occult Tech

3344.04 --> 3349.74
that was already widely known just being

3347.579 --> 3351.8390000000004
kept secret and then he developed it he

3349.74 --> 3355.5589999999997
got a hold of it and he developed it

3351.839 --> 3359.0
and brought it to in further depths

3355.559 --> 3359.0
more refining depths

3362.339 --> 3364.88
right

3365.7 --> 3369.66
well look at how history shows it's like

3367.619 --> 3372.9
oh this is genius and

3369.66 --> 3374.46
he invented it all really invented all

3372.9 --> 3376.92
those things that have probably already

3374.46 --> 3378.66
been there and used for

3376.92 --> 3381.1800000000003
for a while

3378.66 --> 3384.42
yeah that sounds like a cover story

3381.18 --> 3387.66
the genius inventory invented it

3384.42 --> 3390.42
yeah or it was really already there and

3387.66 --> 3393.18
then like it was used a couple of times

3390.42 --> 3395.46
and now they have to like oh okay

3393.18 --> 3398.0989999999997
uh how do we cover this okay well this

3395.46 --> 3400.319
guy just invented that

3398.099 --> 3403.1400000000003
okay we're gonna make up this guy who

3400.319 --> 3405.72
invented it and then those other people

3403.14 --> 3407.0989999999997
got a hold of it through them through

3405.72 --> 3408.8999999999996
him

3407.099 --> 3411.48
and then we got a cover story as to

3408.9 --> 3414.02
where's this this is coming from

3411.48 --> 3414.02
see

3416.099 --> 3423.3590000000004
like how do we cover for Tesla coil Tech

3420.18 --> 3425.3999999999996
oh we make somebody up that invents

3423.359 --> 3428.5789999999997
Tesla call Tech right around the time

3425.4 --> 3431.1600000000003
where it was like more publicly being

3428.579 --> 3435.059
used for some reason

3431.16 --> 3438.0
so yeah we always had that we had that

3435.059 --> 3439.92
for hundreds of years it's super secret

3438.0 --> 3442.2
it's like need to know basis if you if

3439.92 --> 3444.119
we knew you knew then you get

3442.2 --> 3446.7
assassinated kind of thing

3444.119 --> 3449.88
and oh well this time we had like more

3446.7 --> 3451.98
publicly use it like the the remnants of

3449.88 --> 3454.44
it are still there what happened well

3451.98 --> 3457.14
let's make a good cover story

3454.44 --> 3459.54
let's make somebody up that invented it

3457.14 --> 3461.46
at the time and then with him it was

3459.54 --> 3464.7799999999997
lost again

3461.46 --> 3464.78
oh you got your cover story

3472.859 --> 3478.44
right and the same goes for Archimedes

3476.64 --> 3481.02
by the way which is really hilarious

3478.44 --> 3482.099
because I also watched the Indiana Jones

3481.02 --> 3485.46
movie

3482.099 --> 3487.7400000000002
the dial of Destiny

3485.46 --> 3490.26
which is very very typically Indiana

3487.74 --> 3491.64
Jones by the way I I actually kind of

3490.26 --> 3494.2200000000003
liked the movie

3491.64 --> 3495.42
it's just that Harrison Ford is so damn

3494.22 --> 3498.0589999999997
old

3495.42 --> 3501.9
like he can't really play Indiana Jones

3498.059 --> 3504.9
anymore properly he's just too he's too

3501.9 --> 3506.819
feeble like his entire stance is just a

3504.9 --> 3509.6600000000003
feeble old man it doesn't work anymore

3506.819 --> 3509.66
it's weird

3509.94 --> 3517.04
but the movie itself it it did seem like

3513.359 --> 3517.04
yeah that's an Indiana Jones movie

3517.92 --> 3522.26
I thought it was better than the

3519.66 --> 3522.2599999999998
previous one

3523.98 --> 3529.7400000000002
but uh yeah they had oh Archimedes

3526.559 --> 3531.9
Archimedes dial

3529.74 --> 3534.4399999999996
this is kind of funny that that was

3531.9 --> 3537.92
happening that I watched that movie

3534.44 --> 3541.5
right after I watched that video from

3537.92 --> 3545.04
mind unveiled which basically is about

3541.5 --> 3547.44
Archimedes and how he probably

3545.04 --> 3552.859
could have been exactly what I just said

3547.44 --> 3552.859
a made-up character to cover for that

3552.98 --> 3557.16
Phoenician

3554.52 --> 3559.619
City melting Tech

3557.16 --> 3562.02
lens Tech that was super Advanced and

3559.619 --> 3563.04
used to just melt entire castles and

3562.02 --> 3568.4
stuff

3563.04 --> 3568.4
so they had to have a figure invent that

3571.74 --> 3577.799
and then it could the tech would have

3574.559 --> 3580.8590000000004
been lost with the death of that figure

3577.799 --> 3583.02
because that works with people's minds

3580.859 --> 3585.0589999999997
if there was somebody that was a genius

3583.02 --> 3589.02
and invented and everybody started using

3585.059 --> 3592.2000000000003
it then for some reason when they die

3589.02 --> 3595.2599999999998
people find it believable that the

3592.2 --> 3597.54
people after that supposed genius they

3595.26 --> 3600.119
don't really understand his work and so

3597.54 --> 3602.94
it's all lost again people find that

3600.119 --> 3605.579
believable it works it works as an

3602.94 --> 3608.28
effective cover story to keep technology

3605.579 --> 3609.7200000000003
completely occulted

3608.28 --> 3611.94
so that's why they keep doing it

3609.72 --> 3615.5989999999997
Archimedes is probably one of those

3611.94 --> 3618.42
figures that was created

3615.599 --> 3620.76
to cover for occulted technology is this

3618.42 --> 3623.04
that's too dangerous to be known that it

3620.76 --> 3628.099
exists

3623.04 --> 3628.099
and Tesla could be one of those as well

3631.859 --> 3635.819
and it doesn't even necessarily mean

3633.9 --> 3638.04
that they had didn't exist

3635.819 --> 3640.5
that they weren't actual people

3638.04 --> 3642.599
it just means that they were probably

3640.5 --> 3645.119
repurposed

3642.599 --> 3649.4
after the fact

3645.119 --> 3649.4
to become a cover story

3650.94 --> 3653.0
um

3653.52 --> 3659.72
right

3655.74 --> 3659.72
so yeah I got plenty of inspiration

3660.0 --> 3662.839
and ideas

3664.619 --> 3669.92
oh yeah and it I I there were some of

3667.319 --> 3673.14
the Indiana Jones movie there were some

3669.92 --> 3675.48
absolutely hysterical and amazing

3673.14 --> 3677.8799999999997
moments in there

3675.48 --> 3681.119
I mean there was one moment and I just

3677.88 --> 3683.2200000000003
could not stop laughing I could not it

3681.119 --> 3685.859
was so funny

3683.22 --> 3688.0789999999997
it was really funny and in Indiana Jones

3685.859 --> 3690.7799999999997
way too but it was amazing and that's

3688.079 --> 3692.2200000000003
like slight spoilers

3690.78 --> 3695.6400000000003
like

3692.22 --> 3698.04
eventually they go to the other time I'm

3695.64 --> 3700.319
not even gonna say exactly how but

3698.04 --> 3703.22
basically it's a it's a type of chase

3700.319 --> 3703.22
scene in an airplane

3704.52 --> 3709.38
and

3705.599 --> 3712.559
then this kid who is like part of the

3709.38 --> 3714.96
Indiana Jones party you could say

3712.559 --> 3719.4
is basically track to follow them and he

3714.96 --> 3721.799
just steals a personal airplane

3719.4 --> 3724.619
a single man airplane

3721.799 --> 3726.96
on the runway to try to follow the the

3724.619 --> 3730.44
plane of the baddies that have Indiana

3726.96 --> 3733.619
Jones with him and all that right

3730.44 --> 3736.7400000000002
but he basically yeah he he wired is

3733.619 --> 3738.559
this just the kid's like 14 or something

3736.74 --> 3742.319
and he's just like

3738.559 --> 3745.079
wiring hot wiring a plane and then

3742.319 --> 3747.359
stealing it and then he actually flies

3745.079 --> 3751.2200000000003
it and it's like wow that's pretty

3747.359 --> 3751.22
that's kind of badass I mean

3751.319 --> 3755.46
like that's not carjacking that's

3753.0 --> 3757.859
airplane jacking and it's and yeah

3755.46 --> 3760.079
that's really freaking Brave of him to

3757.859 --> 3762.5989999999997
do that even it's pretty crazy

3760.079 --> 3765.7200000000003
but that's kind of cool you know but

3762.599 --> 3768.2400000000002
here's the joke he's like in the Chase

3765.72 --> 3769.74
and [ __ ] and bullets are getting fired

3768.24 --> 3771.1189999999997
and then it's like

3769.74 --> 3772.9199999999996
uh

3771.119 --> 3777.059
what

3772.92 --> 3780.2000000000003
the guy who's playing he hijacked was

3777.059 --> 3783.5400000000004
sleeping in the back

3780.2 --> 3786.02
and he's waking up and it's like what

3783.54 --> 3788.7799999999997
the [ __ ] is going on

3786.02 --> 3793.14
it's like

3788.78 --> 3796.3190000000004
you you stole my plane like uh hi

3793.14 --> 3797.46
he's like what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is

3796.319 --> 3802.319
happening

3797.46 --> 3803.88
I I just it's so [ __ ] but it's so

3802.319 --> 3806.22
funny

3803.88 --> 3809.059
I could not stop laughing I mean that

3806.22 --> 3809.0589999999997
was so funny

3810.119 --> 3814.7400000000002
and especially like when they actually

3812.339 --> 3817.02
go to the other time it's like they

3814.74 --> 3818.7599999999998
don't really show that man anymore after

3817.02 --> 3821.42
that point because he would have

3818.76 --> 3821.42
probably been like

3823.14 --> 3829.2799999999997
what's happening

3825.319 --> 3832.2599999999998
I'm still asleep am I not

3829.28 --> 3837.079
they could have put that in they didn't

3832.26 --> 3837.079
but it was just freaking hilarious

3842.64 --> 3848.46
the rest of the basically the how the

3845.16 --> 3851.819
story unfolds is kind of a mess but just

3848.46 --> 3853.619
that one moment was so hysterically

3851.819 --> 3854.88
funny to me that it just made up

3853.619 --> 3857.52
everything

3854.88 --> 3861.559
it just made everything good again it

3857.52 --> 3861.559
was so funny that they did that

3862.2 --> 3865.68
because you really didn't even expect

3863.7 --> 3869.3999999999996
it's like out of nowhere you just like

3865.68 --> 3872.7599999999998
the guy's just like what like oh [ __ ]

3869.4 --> 3876.6600000000003
and it's just some guy who was sleeping

3872.76 --> 3878.579
in the back of his plane yes

3876.66 --> 3881.819
uh

3878.579 --> 3883.619
yeah now there are definitely some

3881.819 --> 3887.579
redeeming qualities to the new Indiana

3883.619 --> 3890.1800000000003
Jones movie but it it's better than the

3887.579 --> 3890.1800000000003
previous one

3891.0 --> 3895.319
but it's just like

3892.98 --> 3897.78
I mean it's really palpable that

3895.319 --> 3902.16
Harrison Ford is just aging

3897.78 --> 3904.559
and like so is his expression quality

3902.16 --> 3907.2
like this is not the same Harrison Ford

3904.559 --> 3910.7400000000002
as the young guy who had all that like

3907.2 --> 3913.2
weird snarkiness and internal expression

3910.74 --> 3916.9799999999996
he doesn't seem to be doing he's like an

3913.2 --> 3919.5
old man and just like wow

3916.98 --> 3921.54
it almost feels like it's like getting

3919.5 --> 3924.119
demented or something not that that's

3921.54 --> 3925.98
probably there but it just he's is like

3924.119 --> 3928.859
the age is really wearing on him and

3925.98 --> 3931.04
it's like it it does ruin the movie a

3928.859 --> 3931.04
bit

3933.96 --> 3939.119
anyway or maybe nobody cares or maybe

3937.14 --> 3941.42
the chat is frozen again how does this

3939.119 --> 3941.42
work

3941.64 --> 3947.0
right

3943.44 --> 3947.0
12 minutes of silence

3949.02 --> 3952.52
no no what

3954.48 --> 3959.28
foreign

3956.0 --> 3961.98
check freezing all the time

3959.28 --> 3964.619
did my video just freeze immediately

3961.98 --> 3968.48
after I refreshed

3964.619 --> 3968.48
God what's going on

3975.54 --> 3979.74
well those cities aren't even really

3978.119 --> 3981.0
regarded as cities anymore it's just

3979.74 --> 3982.859
ruined

3981.0 --> 3987.02
but they're in Ireland there's like

3982.859 --> 3987.02
these melted rock castles and stuff

3988.68 --> 3994.74
so the melted cities are mostly like at

3992.28 --> 3997.92
the oceans

3994.74 --> 4000.3799999999997
which is logical because yeah you can't

3997.92 --> 4002.9
do that deeper Inland but you can

4000.38 --> 4005.78
definitely move around a giant parabolic

4002.9 --> 4006.799
mirror laser it's a solar laser

4005.78 --> 4009.619
basically

4006.799 --> 4013.16
on a big boat on a big barge and then

4009.619 --> 4017.319
melt cities at the coastline

4013.16 --> 4017.319
so that's where the melted cities are

4027.319 --> 4032.18
right also

4029.26 --> 4034.94
the the notion that

4032.18 --> 4037.7599999999998
that did exist

4034.94 --> 4041.38
really makes

4037.76 --> 4041.38
Sun worship

4041.839 --> 4047.599
gives it a whole new dimension

4045.38 --> 4049.28
ever thought of that

4047.599 --> 4052.94
because yeah

4049.28 --> 4057.3190000000004
they literally use the power of the Sun

4052.94 --> 4060.7400000000002
to melt cities

4057.319 --> 4064.7
so they wield it what would be like the

4060.74 --> 4068.18
power of God literally to them

4064.7 --> 4072.2799999999997
it's like give us your power God and we

4068.18 --> 4072.2799999999997
will just burn it all

4073.78 --> 4076.8590000000004
[Music]

4082.88 --> 4088.579
right before its face is botoxed really

4086.599 --> 4091.48
I'm appeal

4088.579 --> 4091.48
I didn't know that

4099.109 --> 4103.64
[Music]

4101.6 --> 4108.58
that's great why the [ __ ] would he do

4103.64 --> 4108.58
that why wouldn't old man just do that

4113.48 --> 4120.379999999999
why why has he been doing that MFL why

4118.279 --> 4122.9800000000005
why the hell would you do that that's so

4120.38 --> 4122.9800000000005
[ __ ] stupid

4123.02 --> 4127.6990000000005
why would he surrender his expression

4126.38 --> 4131.42
ability

4127.699 --> 4135.98
which is like the [ __ ] value that's

4131.42 --> 4139.16
the value of an actor is your ability to

4135.98 --> 4141.259
have visual facial expression what the

4139.16 --> 4144.799
[ __ ] is wrong with you man you want to

4141.259 --> 4146.359
act then why are you taking away the

4144.799 --> 4150.699
prime quality

4146.359 --> 4150.6990000000005
of your profession it's so stupid

4152.9 --> 4157.2789999999995
I mean

4154.819 --> 4158.779
if you're like an older woman I get it

4157.279 --> 4160.52
it's like oh you don't want to lose the

4158.779 --> 4162.679
beauty and [ __ ] but that's a woman

4160.52 --> 4165.02
you're a man

4162.679 --> 4166.819
you're famous in the movies because you

4165.02 --> 4169.1
were an interesting character because of

4166.819 --> 4171.859
all the Expressions why the [ __ ] would

4169.1 --> 4175.400000000001
you then damage that

4171.859 --> 4178.660000000001
it's so idiotic I don't understand why

4175.4 --> 4178.66
the hell does he do that

4184.52 --> 4191.02
extremely vain yeah but it's stupid

4188.6 --> 4195.320000000001
why would you sacrifice

4191.02 --> 4196.6
your skill your professional skill

4195.32 --> 4201.08
to

4196.6 --> 4202.52
maybe look slightly better like it's so

4201.08 --> 4206.35
dumb

4202.52 --> 4209.409000000001
I can't believe how dumb that is

4206.35 --> 4209.409000000001
[Music]

4211.64 --> 4215.6
right yeah so

4215.78 --> 4219.92
how do you know Emma Peel logical

4217.88 --> 4222.02
conclusions ask the question I just

4219.92 --> 4225.46
assumed you were right but where are you

4222.02 --> 4225.46
getting that info from exactly

4242.98 --> 4247.959999999999
those jobs to help with this vocalists

4250.64 --> 4254.84
let me go after it

4252.92 --> 4257.56
that's cute

4254.84 --> 4257.56
evidence

4257.9 --> 4260.5
evidence

4284.3 --> 4291.320000000001
it's all over the Internet uses really

4287.12 --> 4294.5599999999995
wow okay is there any actual conclusive

4291.32 --> 4298.239
proof though or is it just a bunch of

4294.56 --> 4298.2390000000005
trollish fans or whatever

4307.12 --> 4311.86
let me check if there's fed by the way

4318.26 --> 4321.04
uh

4321.32 --> 4327.58
okay it seems that Nathan Oakley is not

4323.9 --> 4327.58
doing any fed the rest of the week

4354.199 --> 4358.178999999999
okay Jesus really

4400.9 --> 4404.08
but anyway

4404.54 --> 4407.08
right

4407.23 --> 4410.41
[Music]

4418.34 --> 4423.9800000000005
yeah but anyway like logically it's

4421.219 --> 4426.62
really stupid if he's actually like I'm

4423.98 --> 4429.379999999999
not saying he is but if it

4426.62 --> 4430.64
Harrison Ford is actually taking Botox

4429.38 --> 4432.4400000000005
and all that

4430.64 --> 4435.1990000000005
that's just really [ __ ] dumb because

4432.44 --> 4440.139999999999
why the hell would you need that vanity

4435.199 --> 4440.139999999999
when they're already using CGI

4440.179 --> 4445.159
to like

4442.52 --> 4447.7390000000005
make him young again in the movies to do

4445.159 --> 4450.679
scenes from way back

4447.739 --> 4453.32
the uscgi of his face from when he was

4450.679 --> 4454.82
younger so why the [ __ ] would you even

4453.32 --> 4458.12
care

4454.82 --> 4460.46
why can't you just be normally old and

4458.12 --> 4463.46
have your facial expression which then

4460.46 --> 4467.36
they can use that to then

4463.46 --> 4469.58
use the CGI of his younger face and then

4467.36 --> 4473.299999999999
still have the freaking expression you

4469.58 --> 4475.88
had it's so stupid is you're ruining

4473.3 --> 4478.64
your own career man with this

4475.88 --> 4481.76
it's so stupid he could keep doing these

4478.64 --> 4485.06
Indiana Jones films just using his

4481.76 --> 4488.06
younger self face

4485.06 --> 4490.6990000000005
it on some other guy that kind of has

4488.06 --> 4493.400000000001
his younger stature

4490.699 --> 4495.379999999999
and then keep doing the communication

4493.4 --> 4498.92
and the expression

4495.38 --> 4501.38
as an old man I don't get it I don't get

4498.92 --> 4504.58
it why doesn't he do that

4501.38 --> 4504.58
it's so stupid

4520.159 --> 4525.44
has found that the Moon is habitable wow

4525.62 --> 4530.239
yeah that's the dumbest horse [ __ ] I've

4527.719 --> 4533.92
ever heard like Baldwin is not even

4530.239 --> 4533.919999999999
amused by something that dumb

4553.42 --> 4558.159
81 years old yeah so what

4569.719 --> 4576.46
yeah turd I mean I think that it's like

4572.36 --> 4576.46
going fractal insane

4576.86 --> 4581.12
they're

4578.48 --> 4584.379999999999
maybe they're all just breaking the mind

4581.12 --> 4584.38
of the globe believers

4584.659 --> 4588.08
maybe they're just breaking their minds

4586.82 --> 4589.699
at this point it's like oh we're gonna

4588.08 --> 4592.58
give you space missions and then there

4589.699 --> 4595.339999999999
we're gonna make them blatantly insane

4592.58 --> 4597.5
and idiotic and contradictive to

4595.34 --> 4602.8
everything you learn

4597.5 --> 4602.8
just to drive the ball Believers insane

4605.719 --> 4610.46
like why would you do all of this

4608.0 --> 4613.4
nonsense why would you do that

4610.46 --> 4616.6
unless it was to literally Drive the

4613.4 --> 4616.599999999999
Believers insane

4628.219 --> 4634.76
you have to do manned missions

4632.0 --> 4637.54
yeah but who's gonna sacrifice their

4634.76 --> 4637.54
entire life

4637.64 --> 4643.04
to have to lie for National Security the

4641.0 --> 4645.26
rest of your life to everybody and be

4643.04 --> 4648.38
super popular for it too like who the

4645.26 --> 4651.280000000001
hell is even gonna do that at this point

4648.38 --> 4651.28
in India

4654.01 --> 4657.43
[Music]

4675.86 --> 4679.54
they will lose the technology

4686.67 --> 4691.76
[Music]

4689.78 --> 4694.54
one of the speakers in the mission

4691.76 --> 4694.54
control room

4695.36 --> 4698.36
what

4701.84 --> 4705.88
oh somebody died during that

4706.1 --> 4709.84
it's probably facts related

4714.44 --> 4716.98
where

4735.32 --> 4739.84
oh who was alien what are you talking

4737.54 --> 4739.84
about

4742.04 --> 4746.719
the man that died on the job he was 89

4745.34 --> 4750.400000000001
oh okay

4746.719 --> 4750.4
that's pretty freaking old yeah

4780.32 --> 4788.08
hmm

4782.92 --> 4788.08
possibility whistleblowers I doubt it

4794.9 --> 4800.0599999999995
why would there be a whistleblower on

4797.3 --> 4803.12
the inside I mean

4800.06 --> 4804.860000000001
if they come that far what makes you

4803.12 --> 4807.64
think that they would even figure out

4804.86 --> 4807.639999999999
that it was fake

4831.8 --> 4838.2390000000005
I like what happens in Capricorn One

4834.08 --> 4838.239
movie yeah but I mean

4840.56 --> 4844.360000000001
no I'm not gonna go with it

4845.179 --> 4851.6
I think that it's much more logical that

4849.44 --> 4853.5199999999995
it's all vaccine damage that just makes

4851.6 --> 4855.56
so many people die

4853.52 --> 4856.52
during those types of moments I really

4855.56 --> 4859.34
do

4856.52 --> 4862.88
it's gone everywhere every [ __ ] where

4859.34 --> 4867.5
and especially these type of space

4862.88 --> 4869.719
agency numpties they're all factors

4867.5 --> 4872.36
they probably wouldn't even have been

4869.719 --> 4874.159
able to be part of it if they weren't

4872.36 --> 4877.159
fully boosted

4874.159 --> 4879.44
I'm not joking about that

4877.159 --> 4880.5199999999995
keep that in mind

4879.44 --> 4884.48
yeah

4880.52 --> 4887.3
killing whistleblowers is so freaking

4884.48 --> 4890.678999999999
20th century okay

4887.3 --> 4890.679
they don't do that anymore

4891.98 --> 4897.98
they just choke it

4894.64 --> 4901.900000000001
systematically in media in social media

4897.98 --> 4901.9
and then just nobody finds out

4923.12 --> 4927.59
yeah I'm not buying a turret I'm not

4925.82 --> 4935.0
buying it

4927.59 --> 4935.0
[Music]

4944.54 --> 4947.44
foreign

4957.28 --> 4963.679
so yeah I'd want to find that out yeah

4961.219 --> 4965.54
vaccination status right that's what you

4963.679 --> 4968.719
want to know and hey

4965.54 --> 4970.94
if it is involved well then you can get

4968.719 --> 4972.38
even weirder and conspiratorial more

4970.94 --> 4975.46
conspiratorial

4972.38 --> 4975.46
like what if

4976.34 --> 4981.38
they have access to basically

4979.06 --> 4985.1
self-destruct buttons

4981.38 --> 4986.36
that are connected to the Jabs

4985.1 --> 4990.4400000000005
yeah

4986.36 --> 4992.36
there's so much [ __ ] in these Jabs we

4990.44 --> 4994.94
don't even know the full extent of what

4992.36 --> 4996.739
they actually put in there all of it

4994.94 --> 4998.9
and what that does

4996.739 --> 5001.36
they could have a standardized

4998.9 --> 5003.159
self-destruct mechanism that's just in

5001.36 --> 5006.04
the Jab

5003.159 --> 5009.46
that with this the transmission of a

5006.04 --> 5012.82
specific frequency in your vicinity

5009.46 --> 5015.4
you literally die immediately

5012.82 --> 5017.5
they can have that

5015.4 --> 5021.4
yeah you want to get conspiratorial

5017.5 --> 5025.199
about it I find that to be more likely

5021.4 --> 5027.879999999999
than like a like a manual

5025.199 --> 5031.9
person-to-person assassination if you

5027.88 --> 5035.1990000000005
ask me all these [ __ ] numpties that

5031.9 --> 5038.32
are grafted in science people and with

5035.199 --> 5042.78
with all the space they're all Max vast

5038.32 --> 5042.78
all of them all of them

5052.14 --> 5056.26
what

5054.3 --> 5057.64
the [ __ ] are you talking about love

5056.26 --> 5059.820000000001
fruit I have no idea what you're talking

5057.64 --> 5059.820000000001
about

5068.679 --> 5073.06
isn't that graphene oxide stuff

5071.199 --> 5075.28
self-forming or something

5073.06 --> 5077.8
yes

5075.28 --> 5080.0199999999995
and it responds to electromagnetic

5077.8 --> 5083.52
fields

5080.02 --> 5085.900000000001
like its Behavior can be changed through

5083.52 --> 5088.900000000001
electrical Electric electrical influence

5085.9 --> 5088.9
electromagnetism

5089.44 --> 5092.919999999999
right so yeah

5091.179 --> 5095.14
you can very much argue that there is a

5092.92 --> 5097.3
way it's like oh we just subject this

5095.14 --> 5099.76
specific frequency

5097.3 --> 5101.5
like a certain magnetic field or a

5099.76 --> 5106.54
certain sound

5101.5 --> 5109.659
that a component dormant in the vaccine

5106.54 --> 5111.64
response to and then basically deploys

5109.659 --> 5114.4
its system

5111.64 --> 5116.7390000000005
which could be like immediate death

5114.4 --> 5119.82
yeah that can be in there who the hell

5116.739 --> 5119.82
knows what's in there

5123.52 --> 5127.719
trust me that if that is in there we're

5125.679 --> 5130.86
not gonna hear about it for at least

5127.719 --> 5130.86
another 50 years

5134.08 --> 5139.0599999999995
it's because it's way too convenient for

5136.84 --> 5141.88
them to ever reveal that I mean it's

5139.06 --> 5145.7390000000005
basically oh they got like frequency

5141.88 --> 5148.4800000000005
based instant death from the inside

5145.739 --> 5150.82
systems and everybody's have to take

5148.48 --> 5153.94
effects yeah well that's basically like

5150.82 --> 5156.28
a new solar death ray it's gonna be

5153.94 --> 5159.46
[ __ ] a cult they're definitely not

5156.28 --> 5161.38
gonna reveal it until it's run its

5159.46 --> 5164.32
course it's no longer useful they are

5161.38 --> 5165.639
going to try to exploit that to the max

5164.32 --> 5169.0
possible

5165.639 --> 5171.52
range because it's literally oh you all

5169.0 --> 5175.719
have to take this oh now I have the

5171.52 --> 5179.02
death button for every single individual

5175.719 --> 5181.96
just like that kind of

5179.02 --> 5184.26
like Travis in Blake seven it's like

5181.96 --> 5187.179
yeah I got this device

5184.26 --> 5188.92
yeah I just push this button and you die

5187.179 --> 5189.82
yeah that's kind of that's what they

5188.92 --> 5192.34
want

5189.82 --> 5193.659
it's the ultimate feudalist system it's

5192.34 --> 5195.52
like the Lord

5193.659 --> 5197.98
back in the day could just point at

5195.52 --> 5199.6
somebody say kill and the soldiers would

5197.98 --> 5202.419999999999
literally slaughter them immediately

5199.6 --> 5204.639
yeah now that really doesn't work

5202.42 --> 5206.38
anymore but now they might have like oh

5204.639 --> 5207.9400000000005
everybody just gets injected with this

5206.38 --> 5211.3
and now

5207.94 --> 5213.759999999999
the secret person cabal can just like oh

5211.3 --> 5216.88
that person

5213.76 --> 5218.9400000000005
is falling out of line or is a risk to

5216.88 --> 5221.139
my power or reputation

5218.94 --> 5223.178999999999
I'm dead

5221.139 --> 5226.4400000000005
yeah

5223.179 --> 5229.659
ultimate Neo feudal system for control

5226.44 --> 5231.699
absolute control absolute autocratic

5229.659 --> 5234.339999999999
power

5231.699 --> 5237.36
like what the nobility from medieval

5234.34 --> 5237.360000000001
times always wanted

5248.32 --> 5251.94
Blake seven is good yeah

5251.98 --> 5254.638999999999
it is

5260.1 --> 5263.88
button I'm sure it did

5267.46 --> 5270.42
good

5273.159 --> 5280.179
career board for the masses yeah well

5277.06 --> 5281.38
yeah the nuke is the fear porn for the

5280.179 --> 5283.0
masses

5281.38 --> 5286.54
but

5283.0 --> 5291.179
the actual devastating potential of what

5286.54 --> 5291.179
exists is worse than nukes

5293.44 --> 5300.099999999999
because there is infant infinite

5297.219 --> 5302.92
destruction yeah a nuke is supposedly a

5300.1 --> 5305.320000000001
device an explosion you have to put it

5302.92 --> 5309.9400000000005
there it goes off one time

5305.32 --> 5313.36
but a gigantic parabolic laser mirror

5309.94 --> 5315.839999999999
just one of them could melt a thousand

5313.36 --> 5315.839999999999
cities

5316.719 --> 5323.92
and that was in ancient times okay

5321.28 --> 5326.739
just one [ __ ] device could like melt

5323.92 --> 5330.04
a thousand cities yeah think about it

5326.739 --> 5333.82
that's worse than a nuke a nuke is one

5330.04 --> 5335.8
[ __ ] explosion supposedly yeah

5333.82 --> 5338.679
if you have one device and you can

5335.8 --> 5340.3
destroy a thousand cities I'd say that's

5338.679 --> 5343.0
worse

5340.3 --> 5344.92
yeah and now they can potentially have

5343.0 --> 5348.88
hundreds of them

5344.92 --> 5351.1
even small ones on on like mini drones

5348.88 --> 5352.78
and [ __ ] who knows how far this goes

5351.1 --> 5355.3
dude

5352.78 --> 5360.719
if this goes out of hand

5355.3 --> 5360.719
like they could literally end up like

5360.88 --> 5366.28
creating a cataclys and that literally

5363.1 --> 5368.38
like destroys every single City like

5366.28 --> 5370.78
every house

5368.38 --> 5373.54
in the entire Realm

5370.78 --> 5375.58
could just become destroyed in a matter

5373.54 --> 5377.32
of a few days

5375.58 --> 5379.0
with this [ __ ]

5377.32 --> 5381.699
they were just like everything just

5379.0 --> 5382.719
certainly is on fire but not the trees

5381.699 --> 5385.239
though

5382.719 --> 5388.179
and then suddenly everybody's gone yeah

5385.239 --> 5392.159
that can actually happen now

5388.179 --> 5392.159
is worse than nukes

5400.84 --> 5406.3
death ray brought you must by The

5403.42 --> 5408.88
Apprentice yeah well he probably did

5406.3 --> 5411.58
involve that sword attack

5408.88 --> 5413.9800000000005
the Tesla attack supposedly from his

5411.58 --> 5416.38
uncle yeah Trump's Uncle he bragged

5413.98 --> 5418.86
about that that he had that

5416.38 --> 5422.639
and he was probably involved with 9 11

5418.86 --> 5422.639
with bringing it down

5422.92 --> 5427.7390000000005
Trump was probably involved yeah

5430.94 --> 5441.219999999999
[Music]

5441.48 --> 5446.379999999999
it's called

5443.679 --> 5449.58
I'm gonna put it back in the oven

5446.38 --> 5449.58
be right back

5551.8 --> 5554.46
foreign

5577.3 --> 5581.26
right so anyway I'm gonna keep doing the

5579.4 --> 5583.719
show I'm gonna keep going I guess this

5581.26 --> 5586.12
entire week is going to be

5583.719 --> 5589.06
like this

5586.12 --> 5590.739
beautiful weather I'm gonna start a

5589.06 --> 5592.780000000001
little later so you can expect me

5590.739 --> 5593.739
tomorrow and the day after and the day

5592.78 --> 5595.84
after that

5593.739 --> 5600.04
to start probably

5595.84 --> 5602.4400000000005
after one o'clock around a half

5600.04 --> 5605.56
an hour late

5602.44 --> 5609.339999999999
if not an hour late so no Fe indeed yeah

5605.56 --> 5612.46
there's not gonna be any fvd entire week

5609.34 --> 5616.32
but I will be there

5612.46 --> 5616.32
if you guys keep supporting me

5618.76 --> 5621.780000000001
it's not over yet

5634.739 --> 5639.759999999999
no not pewter boss Nathan's just gone on

5638.139 --> 5641.86
vacation

5639.76 --> 5644.139
probably because of the weather so he's

5641.86 --> 5647.08
probably gone out

5644.139 --> 5650.1
like at that cheap hotel thing he went

5647.08 --> 5650.1
to like last year

5650.98 --> 5655.239
probably doing that again just taking

5652.659 --> 5657.4
out the family in this perfect weather

5655.239 --> 5660.599999999999
right I mean

5657.4 --> 5660.599999999999
I wouldn't blame him

5661.42 --> 5665.6990000000005
but it is disappointing though

5668.199 --> 5671.94
but no his computer is fine

5672.46 --> 5676.679
he hasn't had a crash in uh in a while

5686.4 --> 5692.199
how did he swing getting the kids out of

5689.44 --> 5694.599999999999
school first week I don't know

5692.199 --> 5696.839999999999
I don't know how that works Oz don't ask

5694.6 --> 5696.84
me

5704.5 --> 5707.5
with with

5705.94 --> 5710.259999999999
season what I don't know what you're

5707.5 --> 5714.179
talking about turret he's in trouble

5710.26 --> 5714.179
with what what are you talking about

5733.48 --> 5739.0599999999995
blue brother I mean yeah I am too it's

5736.9 --> 5741.719
just annoying that there isn't a live FD

5739.06 --> 5741.719
that is all

5745.659 --> 5750.599999999999
he lost all his crypto savings what

5752.02 --> 5757.2390000000005
was that wetsuit I don't know but I did

5755.26 --> 5761.02
hear somebody

5757.239 --> 5764.138999999999
like had a bad transfer and basically

5761.02 --> 5766.96
somebody like stole all his crypto

5764.139 --> 5769.3
something I had heard that

5766.96 --> 5771.94
he lost like a few thousand dollars

5769.3 --> 5773.38
because of that worth of crypto

5771.94 --> 5775.839999999999
I don't know man I don't know anything

5773.38 --> 5778.3
about it except for what I experienced

5775.84 --> 5780.04
through the Dark World so I might have

5778.3 --> 5781.96
actually experienced that through his

5780.04 --> 5783.46
eyes it's just like another one of those

5781.96 --> 5784.719
weird flashes where I don't even know

5783.46 --> 5787.06
who that is

5784.719 --> 5789.659
so yeah

5787.06 --> 5789.659000000001
whatever

5792.94 --> 5799.08
crypto is a very risky thing

5796.12 --> 5799.08
it can be

5806.679 --> 5814.3
you know it's not as easy and safe as

5811.12 --> 5817.12
cash it really isn't

5814.3 --> 5820.179
data can get lost

5817.12 --> 5822.34
password [ __ ] can get lot things can get

5820.179 --> 5824.86
lost and then you it's just gone yeah

5822.34 --> 5827.159000000001
that doesn't happen to cash because it's

5824.86 --> 5827.159
physical

5829.3 --> 5837.0
is there crypto in the Dark World

5832.6 --> 5837.0
not consciously I mean

5838.0 --> 5844.36
like I wasn't concerned with that but I

5841.36 --> 5848.4
did in a certain phase

5844.36 --> 5848.4
I didn't notice that it was there

5848.86 --> 5853.659
I did actually thought for a while that

5851.199 --> 5856.78
[ __ ] like Bitcoin was going to be

5853.659 --> 5859.839999999999
completely standardized

5856.78 --> 5861.58
like did was being suggested that that

5859.84 --> 5864.6990000000005
was the case

5861.58 --> 5867.94
but then it didn't really expand on it

5864.699 --> 5870.5199999999995
and now living through the actual thing

5867.94 --> 5871.839999999999
it seems like it didn't hit off

5870.52 --> 5874.96
as

5871.84 --> 5877.719
was being shown to me

5874.96 --> 5880.2390000000005
so I guess their plan has failed

5877.719 --> 5883.4800000000005
because it also was plan of the Devils

5880.239 --> 5886.178999999999
for some reason I don't know man I don't

5883.48 --> 5890.28
understand all of it

5886.179 --> 5890.28
why I got to see certain things

5897.76 --> 5900.3
cool

5906.58 --> 5911.82
his sister is missing right that's

5909.04 --> 5911.82
pretty [ __ ] up

5918.88 --> 5925.92
what did people wear in my visions

5922.48 --> 5925.919999999999
mostly suits

5939.84 --> 5944.88
no medieval stuff not at all

5951.1 --> 5956.6990000000005
like modern suits yeah like modern suits

5953.98 --> 5956.699
exactly

5964.9 --> 5970.96
but not all of them like the man the man

5968.139 --> 5973.2390000000005
in black the black robed man with beard

5970.96 --> 5974.94
yeah he was not wearing a suit he was

5973.239 --> 5977.98
wearing a really

5974.94 --> 5980.32
[ __ ] yeah darkish

5977.98 --> 5983.218999999999
rope thing

5980.32 --> 5983.219
not a suit

5984.34 --> 5988.78
but anything that was like government

5986.32 --> 5991.799999999999
related it was they were all wearing

5988.78 --> 5991.8
suits everything

5992.02 --> 5996.400000000001
and I mean just look at them out there

5994.36 --> 5999.36
they are wearing suits all the time so

5996.4 --> 5999.36
it only makes sense

6015.659 --> 6020.339999999999
now dreaming that a lost starving line

6018.659 --> 6022.5
was chasing you in your neighborhood

6020.34 --> 6026.6
what the hell

6022.5 --> 6026.6
that's a freaky dream you hear it

6027.6 --> 6031.46
interesting that he was starving

6031.739 --> 6035.659
that's probably symbolic

6048.48 --> 6053.4
so that that's actually in a way a good

6051.179 --> 6055.4400000000005
sign that you took note that he was

6053.4 --> 6057.599999999999
starving that means that

6055.44 --> 6060.719
the forces that are coming after you are

6057.6 --> 6062.76
having serious trouble with you

6060.719 --> 6065.159
and sure it's still gonna catch you in

6062.76 --> 6066.900000000001
the end in the dream because the psycho

6065.159 --> 6068.759999999999
has to close

6066.9 --> 6071.839999999999
in order for that

6068.76 --> 6071.84
to work

6072.78 --> 6078.0
but it's just an interesting

6076.139 --> 6080.400000000001
fact that you noticed that he was

6078.0 --> 6082.5
starving that's fairy telling

6080.4 --> 6086.179
something that hunts you is having a

6082.5 --> 6086.179
hard time that's very good sign

6089.34 --> 6092.499
[Music]

6098.94 --> 6104.099999999999
what do people eat in the Dark World

6100.92 --> 6107.34
what the [ __ ] is Emma

6104.1 --> 6110.400000000001
it's all a projection it's a gigantic

6107.34 --> 6112.619000000001
Holodeck nobody eats anything they're

6110.4 --> 6115.5
all spirits

6112.619 --> 6117.0
what they eat they eat in the time-bound

6115.5 --> 6120.42
real world

6117.0 --> 6122.76
if they even have a physical body there

6120.42 --> 6125.28
you don't eat in the Dark World

6122.76 --> 6127.9800000000005
you're a spirit you don't have a

6125.28 --> 6129.84
physical body to process physical food

6127.98 --> 6132.08
and besides there isn't anything

6129.84 --> 6138.5
physically there

6132.08 --> 6138.5
it's all just a simulation an appearance

6142.679 --> 6150.119
You could argue that you eat energy

6147.36 --> 6153.179
like one Spirit can consume the energy

6150.119 --> 6154.48
of another Spirit suck it dry

6153.179 --> 6157.08
decrease it

6154.48 --> 6159.78
[Music]

6157.08 --> 6163.58
that's probably as far as any kind of

6159.78 --> 6163.58
like consumption goes

6166.86 --> 6173.219
like drain the charge of a spirit

6170.58 --> 6174.0599999999995
but it only really works if they allowed

6173.219 --> 6177.6
it

6174.06 --> 6181.080000000001
if they allowed the conditions to arrive

6177.6 --> 6183.900000000001
for others to be able to do that to them

6181.08 --> 6187.0199999999995
that includes myself and yes I was also

6183.9 --> 6188.94
drained in certain at certain points I

6187.02 --> 6190.679
just feel really lucky that now that

6188.94 --> 6193.44
I've come out of it I still have

6190.679 --> 6196.4
strength I felt so incredibly weakened

6193.44 --> 6196.4
when I got out of it

6198.659 --> 6202.32
all right low fruit yeah see you later

6200.34 --> 6204.96
thanks for the good questions I like

6202.32 --> 6207.239
that I like detailed questions

6204.96 --> 6210.179
likely when people suddenly get curious

6207.239 --> 6211.98
like about Dark World Vision stuff

6210.179 --> 6214.4400000000005
and if I'm gonna tell you no no no

6211.98 --> 6217.678999999999
you're wrong don't ever feel this like

6214.44 --> 6219.839999999999
embarrassed or anything okay don't I'm

6217.679 --> 6222.0
just glad somebody's finally asking

6219.84 --> 6224.04
questions about it

6222.0 --> 6225.84
I mean I've been talking about it for

6224.04 --> 6228.84
like eight years and

6225.84 --> 6231.119000000001
barely anybody ever asks me anything

6228.84 --> 6234.38
except for a troll that just thinks it's

6231.119 --> 6234.38
funny when I say that

6235.44 --> 6239.299999999999
so yeah thanks for the good questions

6252.719 --> 6257.58
right yeah by the way tarot about the

6255.179 --> 6260.28
interpretation yes it is really

6257.58 --> 6262.08
something but also realize that if it's

6260.28 --> 6264.84
chasing you and it got you well that

6262.08 --> 6268.5599999999995
means that you're still in it no you're

6264.84 --> 6271.1990000000005
still in a transformative struggle

6268.56 --> 6274.02
but you are having good chances because

6271.199 --> 6276.239
the thing that's chasing you is having a

6274.02 --> 6279.42
hard time

6276.239 --> 6281.879999999999
you had proof of that it's like palpable

6279.42 --> 6283.38
signs of that and that's a good thing it

6281.88 --> 6284.9400000000005
means basically you're still in the

6283.38 --> 6287.58
struggle something's still trying to get

6284.94 --> 6289.799999999999
you when it's having a hard time and

6287.58 --> 6292.34
that's a good indicator

6289.8 --> 6292.34
anyway

6293.88 --> 6300.36
ah you're gonna have some time in the

6296.04 --> 6302.28
sun I'm gonna ripen that fruit some more

6300.36 --> 6305.299999999999
all right love food yeah have fun with

6302.28 --> 6305.3
that see you later

6312.119 --> 6316.32
right but anyway Emma Peel just for the

6314.46 --> 6320.06
clarification everything dark world is

6316.32 --> 6320.0599999999995
not it's not a physical reality

6323.76 --> 6331.02
it mimics physical reality

6327.179 --> 6332.159
but that's only because spirits

6331.02 --> 6334.9800000000005
think

6332.159 --> 6339.0
through their experience of physical

6334.98 --> 6341.699
reality and that's why the spirit Realm

6339.0 --> 6344.4
which you could call it the Dark World

6341.699 --> 6347.638999999999
whatever that is

6344.4 --> 6350.9
mimics the Physical Realm because that

6347.639 --> 6350.900000000001
is what makes sense to you

6350.94 --> 6355.98
you could think the same of Dreams

6352.98 --> 6359.04
themselves like why do you dream

6355.98 --> 6361.259999999999
typical experience that relate to

6359.04 --> 6363.54
physical experiences

6361.26 --> 6367.1
because that is

6363.54 --> 6367.1
what makes sense to you

6368.1 --> 6374.0
even though arguably the dream itself is

6371.159 --> 6376.379999999999
a purely a projected

6374.0 --> 6378.96
experience where the visuals are more

6376.38 --> 6382.08
like a side effect of the internal

6378.96 --> 6385.52
frequency refining and processing the

6382.08 --> 6385.5199999999995
internal conflict resolving

6385.619 --> 6392.96
and then the dream becomes a symbol

6388.679 --> 6392.96
visually expressing that

6393.54 --> 6398.84
but it's only secondary the visuals are

6396.06 --> 6398.84
really secondary

6409.619 --> 6414.179
ah you brought the barrier down and you

6411.84 --> 6416.6990000000005
didn't awesome

6414.179 --> 6420.56
sounds like you got a good grip then

6416.699 --> 6420.5599999999995
it's great that you could do that

6420.96 --> 6426.54
no wonder he's hungry too by the way

6424.8 --> 6429.4800000000005
if you keep doing that and he keeps

6426.54 --> 6433.92
chasing you and never getting it and

6429.48 --> 6437.0599999999995
yeah you're gonna go hungry symbolically

6433.92 --> 6437.06
the thing that haunts you

6443.1 --> 6447.659000000001
do the spirits and suit age no nothing

6445.679 --> 6450.9800000000005
age is in the Dark World

6447.659 --> 6450.98
there is no time there

6452.58 --> 6455.42
is only

6456.42 --> 6462.36
how the spirit has changed over time

6461.04 --> 6465.239
so

6462.36 --> 6466.739
if it is a spirit of a person that's

6465.239 --> 6469.0199999999995
transferring there

6466.739 --> 6473.659
or haven't experience sitting there then

6469.02 --> 6473.659000000001
it's likely that they will project

6475.199 --> 6481.138999999999
their appearance as how they feel and

6478.08 --> 6484.26
think of themselves at the time as to

6481.139 --> 6486.06
the point where they entered that

6484.26 --> 6488.159000000001
Timeless Realm

6486.06 --> 6489.900000000001
how they think of themselves as they

6488.159 --> 6492.5
entered will determine what they are

6489.9 --> 6492.5
looking like

6492.65 --> 6495.82
[Music]

6502.8 --> 6507.7390000000005
right it's like you represent how you

6505.139 --> 6507.7390000000005
think of yourself

6508.26 --> 6513.780000000001
you're gonna look like

6510.36 --> 6515.099999999999
like I look like what I looked like when

6513.78 --> 6518.5199999999995
I was

6515.1 --> 6520.56
say 23 25.

6518.52 --> 6522.8
that's what I always look like in Dark

6520.56 --> 6522.8
World

6522.84 --> 6530.9400000000005
because that's when I entered it that's

6526.5 --> 6534.5
when or yeah arguably from 17 on but

6530.94 --> 6534.5
like the big chunk

6534.6 --> 6539.58
I looked like that I had those clothes

6537.48 --> 6542.04
from that time

6539.58 --> 6544.26
in the optimal time where I had all the

6542.04 --> 6546.54
money and looked at my best

6544.26 --> 6549.84
where when my clothes weren't all

6546.54 --> 6554.48
raggedy yet like they are now that's how

6549.84 --> 6554.4800000000005
I look in the Dark World at my best

6558.119 --> 6562.94
that's how I will appear to people

6564.0 --> 6569.4
and if you're gonna get in the dark

6566.28 --> 6571.259999999999
world and see me like I am now then

6569.4 --> 6573.42
you're merely like seeing an echo

6571.26 --> 6577.04
because that's not part of my main

6573.42 --> 6577.04
appearance throughout time

6579.0 --> 6584.219
but who knows maybe I'm going to at some

6581.46 --> 6586.9800000000005
point naturally re-enter the Dark World

6584.219 --> 6590.04
Without external interference

6586.98 --> 6593.218999999999
and then in my new form be there

6590.04 --> 6596.34
parallel to my old form

6593.219 --> 6598.08
with with which I highly disagree by now

6596.34 --> 6599.9400000000005
by the way

6598.08 --> 6602.34
the problem is once you enter the dark

6599.94 --> 6605.099999999999
world like that in a Timeless Realm

6602.34 --> 6607.56
you enter it how you were in your mind

6605.1 --> 6609.900000000001
and feelings as you entered it and no

6607.56 --> 6611.88
matter how long you appear to stay there

6609.9 --> 6614.46
no matter what you do

6611.88 --> 6617.04
that is how you are

6614.46 --> 6620.1
the experience in the dark world can't

6617.04 --> 6622.5
actually change you

6620.1 --> 6624.84
it can bring you knowledge

6622.5 --> 6627.96
can bring you some insights but they

6624.84 --> 6630.92
can't change how you feel about things

6627.96 --> 6630.92
and how you are

6630.96 --> 6634.5
that only happens in the in the physical

6633.119 --> 6638.339999999999
world

6634.5 --> 6640.44
so whatever ideology and drive you bring

6638.34 --> 6642.900000000001
with you as you enter the dark world

6640.44 --> 6646.0199999999995
that's what you will keep

6642.9 --> 6648.719
and you might either achieve or fail

6646.02 --> 6650.9400000000005
whatever you seem to be doing there

6648.719 --> 6652.56
but you can't change it even when you

6650.94 --> 6655.099999999999
[ __ ] figure out you were wrong about

6652.56 --> 6657.3
everything then you still can't change

6655.1 --> 6660.679
that was something that was a real

6657.3 --> 6660.679
serious obstacle for me

6660.719 --> 6667.7390000000005
because I did figure out I I entered it

6663.48 --> 6671.839999999999
in a very very flawed mindset with very

6667.739 --> 6671.839999999999
very foolish naive ideas

6675.48 --> 6680.879999999999
which weren't like super overboard but

6678.06 --> 6683.159000000001
they were very wrong nonetheless and

6680.88 --> 6686.639
it's like I couldn't be changing my mind

6683.159 --> 6688.619
so I was like I have to change my mind

6686.639 --> 6691.1990000000005
it's like I realized through pure

6688.619 --> 6695.099999999999
Consciousness like I have to change this

6691.199 --> 6697.739
I have to change this but I couldn't

6695.1 --> 6701.159000000001
I couldn't change my own mind even when

6697.739 --> 6704.159
I cognitively figured out that I must

6701.159 --> 6706.138999999999
that's [ __ ] frustrating as hell

6704.159 --> 6708.659
and that makes you feel like you have no

6706.139 --> 6711.179
control over yourself

6708.659 --> 6712.92
and that's why I also don't recommend it

6711.179 --> 6715.26
if you enter the dark world that you

6712.92 --> 6717.3
[ __ ] stay for 80 years like an idiot

6715.26 --> 6719.96
like a [ __ ] idiot that is called

6717.3 --> 6719.96
Arwin

6729.44 --> 6737.099999999999
how is time measured it isn't

6732.54 --> 6740.239
it is a measured it's just like the

6737.1 --> 6740.2390000000005
things that you bump into

6741.0 --> 6746.28
you have to get a bearing based on what

6744.48 --> 6750.119
you bump into

6746.28 --> 6752.5199999999995
as to where it is in time where have you

6750.119 --> 6757.04
what are you connecting up with from

6752.52 --> 6757.040000000001
what time are you connecting up with

6758.159 --> 6761.82
you

6759.86 --> 6763.679
yeah you could just kick him out

6761.82 --> 6765.239
immediately

6763.679 --> 6768.3
that's hard idiot

6765.239 --> 6769.58
who gives a [ __ ]

6768.3 --> 6772.860000000001
um

6769.58 --> 6775.44
well maybe I am you [ __ ] [ __ ] what

6772.86 --> 6778.259999999999
are you gonna [ __ ] do about it yeah I

6775.44 --> 6780.049999999999
got control over this [ __ ]

6778.26 --> 6782.719
yeah

6780.05 --> 6785.639
[Music]

6782.719 --> 6787.219
you're just a [ __ ] numpty dip [ __ ]

6785.639 --> 6790.639
that doesn't understand

6787.219 --> 6794.639
internal complex workings of people

6790.639 --> 6796.159000000001
inherent abilities of people

6794.639 --> 6800.2390000000005
yeah

6796.159 --> 6805.46
supernatural abilities of people it's

6800.239 --> 6805.459999999999
schizophrenia [ __ ] you yeah

6805.5 --> 6811.98
even if it were I don't give a [ __ ] yeah

6809.52 --> 6813.360000000001
you could call me schizophrenic all you

6811.98 --> 6816.78
[ __ ] like what are you gonna do about

6813.36 --> 6819.599999999999
it ah [ __ ] I'm just gonna be me I'm

6816.78 --> 6823.32
gonna use what I do you're not gonna

6819.6 --> 6825.119000000001
stop what I do you hear me [ __ ] call me

6823.32 --> 6827.42
schizophrenic oh you like I don't give a

6825.119 --> 6827.42
[ __ ]

6828.78 --> 6834.8
I know what I know

6831.6 --> 6834.8
and I'm telling it

6835.619 --> 6839.119
and you can't stop me

6843.48 --> 6849.44
and I'm gonna get my Illuminati house on

6846.84 --> 6849.4400000000005
all right

6884.179 --> 6887.54
just uh

6887.659 --> 6891.5599999999995
like confirm it

6891.78 --> 6896.5199999999995
it's a message because I probably have

6893.58 --> 6898.86
the glove controls blocked yeah yeah

6896.52 --> 6902.159000000001
but it's fine you know because

6898.86 --> 6904.139
oh no I might have some schizophrenic

6902.159 --> 6906.599999999999
traits yeah that's what some people in

6904.139 --> 6909.96
my past thought too did actually get

6906.6 --> 6912.42
tested to a certain extent but they they

6909.96 --> 6917.1
stopped doing it you know why

6912.42 --> 6920.46
because I had the most control over it

6917.1 --> 6922.9800000000005
and the highest ability to be able to

6920.46 --> 6924.78
describe details accurately and

6922.98 --> 6928.459999999999
consistently

6924.78 --> 6928.46
that they had ever seen

6929.159 --> 6935.58
I have more control over this

6932.48 --> 6939.48
presupposed to be schizophrenia then

6935.58 --> 6942.36
anybody had had ever talked to

6939.48 --> 6944.9
that had this so they wouldn't even

6942.36 --> 6949.08
officially classify me like that because

6944.9 --> 6951.42
my control abilities over it was unheard

6949.08 --> 6955.86
of literally

6951.42 --> 6955.86
like they had no references

6956.04 --> 6961.56
to anybody else that had this level of

6959.4 --> 6963.54
cognitive control

6961.56 --> 6967.8
over it

6963.54 --> 6971.78
which they claim is a mental disease

6967.8 --> 6971.78
yeah that's the difference

6978.3 --> 6982.8
comes a problem when both feet yeah well

6980.46 --> 6984.4800000000005
when you lose control Manta that's when

6982.8 --> 6987.179
it becomes a problem when you have no

6984.48 --> 6989.4
control when you have no control over

6987.179 --> 6992.88
your own conscious perception when you

6989.4 --> 6995.159
have no oversight the connecting knowing

6992.88 --> 6996.06
element over whatever state you're going

6995.159 --> 6999.0
to be

6996.06 --> 7000.860000000001
yeah then you would be like wow that

6999.0 --> 7002.78
person is really weird it seems like

7000.86 --> 7005.0599999999995
this one moment that like that at the

7002.78 --> 7006.739
other moment it doesn't know one moment

7005.06 --> 7009.26
to the other yeah that's what people

7006.739 --> 7011.9
call schizophrenic why

7009.26 --> 7013.46
because they have no oversight over

7011.9 --> 7015.98
themselves

7013.46 --> 7020.86
they have no they lost

7015.98 --> 7020.86
their Consciousness is broken

7020.96 --> 7025.219
my Consciousness is not broken my

7024.02 --> 7027.5
Consciousness is like this

7025.219 --> 7029.54
indestructible Diamond it will never

7027.5 --> 7033.139
break no matter what

7029.54 --> 7035.36
and I've experienced a lot to back up

7033.139 --> 7036.56
that claim that it's not gonna break no

7035.36 --> 7039.32
matter what

7036.56 --> 7042.1990000000005
like I will literally die torturously

7039.32 --> 7045.4
before it's broken my Consciousness will

7042.199 --> 7047.839999999999
no matter what happens to my body never

7045.4 --> 7050.54
be broken

7047.84 --> 7052.46
it will never break no matter what even

7050.54 --> 7054.92
if that means literal hell for all

7052.46 --> 7058.159
attorneys not gonna break it will wither

7054.92 --> 7062.179
it will tear it will slowly burn up

7058.159 --> 7065.0599999999995
perhaps but it will never break ever

7062.179 --> 7067.58
no matter the condition no matter the

7065.06 --> 7070.400000000001
torture it has never broken my

7067.58 --> 7072.5599999999995
Consciousness is never broken

7070.4 --> 7075.5599999999995
not like that it's always under control

7072.56 --> 7078.26
whenever I had like super hallucinogenic

7075.56 --> 7081.5
moments I'd still have a [ __ ] grip on

7078.26 --> 7083.360000000001
it as it is happening as it would be

7081.5 --> 7085.4
happening I would be able to identify

7083.36 --> 7088.4
the hallucination as it was happening

7085.4 --> 7091.04
and literally tell about it what I saw

7088.4 --> 7095.179
was happening at when it was happening

7091.04 --> 7098.84
and still have control over me

7095.179 --> 7102.38
yeah I have control

7098.84 --> 7104.84
unheard of levels of control

7102.38 --> 7106.219
over my own Consciousness unheard of

7104.84 --> 7108.08
levels

7106.219 --> 7111.8
no matter what happens to me no matter

7108.08 --> 7114.5
if I become possessed or not

7111.8 --> 7116.84
it doesn't matter I have control

7114.5 --> 7118.58
I can feel really shitty I can feel

7116.84 --> 7120.8
really great

7118.58 --> 7123.199
but whatever

7120.8 --> 7129.34
wherever I am within the spectrum of all

7123.199 --> 7129.339999999999
that I have control of my conscience

7142.219 --> 7147.38
do you find that those types of people

7144.139 --> 7150.26
tend to attract the attracting to

7147.38 --> 7152.179
talking to me yeah

7150.26 --> 7153.7390000000005
because those are the people that get

7152.179 --> 7156.1990000000005
bored

7153.739 --> 7158.9
by people's numptiness

7156.199 --> 7162.379999999999
yeah the board people they all come to

7158.9 --> 7163.879999999999
me eventually because guess what

7162.38 --> 7166.400000000001
my

7163.88 --> 7169.58
from my perspective

7166.4 --> 7172.759999999999
my life would be considered boring

7169.58 --> 7176.659
but two other people

7172.76 --> 7179.06
I can be unbelievably interesting

7176.659 --> 7182.598999999999
I live a boring life

7179.06 --> 7186.099
but I am not boring

7182.599 --> 7186.099
hope that makes sense to you

7200.739 --> 7207.138999999999
could drive me awesome yeah yeah I love

7203.84 --> 7208.9400000000005
I love Vulcans Banta

7207.139 --> 7212.119
I thought Vulcans is like one of the

7208.94 --> 7213.739
most awesome sci-fi cultures that was

7212.119 --> 7216.199
ever created

7213.739 --> 7218.9
I feel very much

7216.199 --> 7222.259999999999
like a Vulcan at times

7218.9 --> 7225.32
I am that fanatical about logic but I am

7222.26 --> 7226.6990000000005
also very much aware that emotions are

7225.32 --> 7229.04
critical

7226.699 --> 7230.78
and then oh yeah emotions good in the

7229.04 --> 7233.3
way of that yeah yeah I [ __ ] deal

7230.78 --> 7235.699
with it yeah that's called dealing with

7233.3 --> 7239.38
it dealing with a different scenario

7235.699 --> 7239.379999999999
with different grips

7242.96 --> 7246.38
I learned that

7244.76 --> 7249.5
I'm like a

7246.38 --> 7252.92
a half Vulcan and half elf very typical

7249.5 --> 7256.04
so I have that emotions and I'm learning

7252.92 --> 7257.719
to deal with emotions logically yeah oh

7256.04 --> 7259.099
that makes no sense yeah it does make

7257.719 --> 7260.9
sense

7259.099 --> 7262.9400000000005
it does make sense

7260.9 --> 7265.28
you can deal with your emotions

7262.94 --> 7268.94
logically if

7265.28 --> 7271.88
you accept that your emotions as it

7268.94 --> 7273.98
exist for a reason that it is there for

7271.88 --> 7277.219
a reason and that their reason isn't

7273.98 --> 7280.699
always some oversimplified stupid

7277.219 --> 7283.52
Evolution based idea from a bunch of

7280.699 --> 7285.5
retards that try to create a reversed

7283.52 --> 7286.88
World reality for everybody to believe

7285.5 --> 7289.52
in yeah

7286.88 --> 7291.619
now emotions absolutely have functions

7289.52 --> 7293.659000000001
and they have functions within reason as

7291.619 --> 7296.54
well and I am the living proof of that

7293.659 --> 7298.94
because I let my emotions pull me all

7296.54 --> 7302.119
over the place and wherever it pulls me

7298.94 --> 7303.32
my intellect will yield from that

7302.119 --> 7306.32
perspective

7303.32 --> 7309.259999999999
and will yield a different fruitful

7306.32 --> 7311.96
insight and result than from another

7309.26 --> 7314.780000000001
perspective where I am not feeling like

7311.96 --> 7318.8
that and I do it all the time all the

7314.78 --> 7319.969999999999
time all the time on my show

7318.8 --> 7322.639
hmm

7319.97 --> 7324.5
[Music]

7322.639 --> 7326.119
anyway I'm gonna take a bite of this

7324.5 --> 7327.79
Illuminati Go song before it gets cold

7326.119 --> 7331.219999999999
again cheers

7327.79 --> 7331.22
[Music]

7332.9 --> 7335.739
thank you

7338.599 --> 7342.76
pure logic not

7345.26 --> 7351.619000000001
pure logic just is

7348.92 --> 7354.8
it's just logic or it isn't the point is

7351.619 --> 7360.44
is that if you're gonna

7354.8 --> 7363.02
only look at the skeletal structures of

7360.44 --> 7367.159
reason and logic and then throw

7363.02 --> 7370.659000000001
everything else out yeah

7367.159 --> 7370.659
you're gonna have problems

7371.0 --> 7376.28
that's called like logic Obsession and

7374.179 --> 7379.6990000000005
then you use the logic as a form of

7376.28 --> 7381.08
escapism to not deal with the other

7379.699 --> 7384.5
parts

7381.08 --> 7386.86
like your emotions and this specific

7384.5 --> 7390.56
personal struggle

7386.86 --> 7392.48
often played out in Star Trek that's

7390.56 --> 7394.34
what they did with the Vulcans they

7392.48 --> 7396.699
showed that inner struggle

7394.34 --> 7401.179
of people that are in this case

7396.699 --> 7403.58
religiously trained to obsess over logic

7401.179 --> 7407.02
and to exclude emotions to ignore them

7403.58 --> 7410.0599999999995
to put them their side to lock them in

7407.02 --> 7411.860000000001
and as a result they don't really know

7410.06 --> 7414.860000000001
how to deal with emotions

7411.86 --> 7417.86
and they continually showed this

7414.86 --> 7420.5
personal inner process on Star Trek

7417.86 --> 7423.199
series all the time with all the Vulcans

7420.5 --> 7426.8
every single time because that is their

7423.199 --> 7430.04
culture that was that culture yeah

7426.8 --> 7432.8
the universal problem with all of Vulcan

7430.04 --> 7435.619
and all Vulcans is

7432.8 --> 7438.5
that they don't really understand

7435.619 --> 7440.839999999999
that emotions are logical and that they

7438.5 --> 7443.9
do have a place

7440.84 --> 7445.52
you just need control over them and that

7443.9 --> 7448.638999999999
doesn't mean that you can't allow them

7445.52 --> 7450.38
to be you just need control over them as

7448.639 --> 7453.02
they manifest that you need to realize

7450.38 --> 7456.679
that when your emotions manifest that

7453.02 --> 7458.179
they will literally color the way you

7456.679 --> 7459.56
see things through your Consciousness

7458.179 --> 7461.78
like a lens

7459.56 --> 7463.6990000000005
will make you see differently it will

7461.78 --> 7465.98
make different things within the

7463.699 --> 7468.259999999999
information that you attain Stand Out

7465.98 --> 7471.678999999999
compared to not having those emotions

7468.26 --> 7474.1990000000005
you need to logically know all those

7471.679 --> 7476.599
things and once you do that then you

7474.199 --> 7481.4
realize that emotions are absolutely

7476.599 --> 7481.400000000001
necessary and absolutely logical

7483.199 --> 7490.04
and that we were all misled by a bunch

7485.9 --> 7492.138999999999
of darwinian [ __ ] retards

7490.04 --> 7494.599
about it

7492.139 --> 7497.659000000001
a bunch of psychopaths telling us that

7494.599 --> 7499.52
emotions are outdated irrelevant and

7497.659 --> 7502.219
beastly [ __ ] you

7499.52 --> 7505.280000000001
we survived because of them

7502.219 --> 7506.9
we are capable of achieving extremities

7505.28 --> 7509.36
because of them

7506.9 --> 7511.82
without them we are not capable of that

7509.36 --> 7514.54
so how can you say that there are just a

7511.82 --> 7519.259999999999
bunch of primitive

7514.54 --> 7521.719
outdated traits go [ __ ] yourself how

7519.26 --> 7526.780000000001
dare you doubt

7521.719 --> 7526.78
the infinite wisdom of God's design

7532.82 --> 7535.719
right

7536.599 --> 7540.56
did they diagnose you with schizophrenia

7538.699 --> 7543.86
try to make you meditation

7540.56 --> 7547.46
well they tried to encourage me to take

7543.86 --> 7549.679
antipsychotics and I

7547.46 --> 7552.26
I declined

7549.679 --> 7555.38
and then eventually I said like I will

7552.26 --> 7559.719
you will not recommend that to me again

7555.38 --> 7559.719
or I will literally not come back

7559.88 --> 7565.6990000000005
because it's all voluntary

7561.98 --> 7569.178999999999
I was never forced to do anything

7565.699 --> 7571.159
like the mental health wise never forced

7569.179 --> 7573.56
I went there because I felt that I had

7571.159 --> 7574.82
issues I had a lot of trouble with

7573.56 --> 7577.76
Society

7574.82 --> 7581.179
and feelings concerning that

7577.76 --> 7583.820000000001
nobody ever forced me to do anything

7581.179 --> 7588.4
because I never

7583.82 --> 7593.679
I never really went crazy like that

7588.4 --> 7593.679
I've never seriously assaulted somebody

7594.32 --> 7599.719
and then went off the rails and like not

7597.08 --> 7602.659
recognizing reality anymore like that's

7599.719 --> 7603.9800000000005
never happened I've had severe panic

7602.659 --> 7606.199
attacks

7603.98 --> 7608.0
I've went really delusional and

7606.199 --> 7611.54
completely disoriented where it's like

7608.0 --> 7614.38
where am I like what just happened I

7611.54 --> 7614.38
don't know what's happened

7614.48 --> 7619.459999999999
but never to a point where it was got so

7617.36 --> 7622.219
bad that

7619.46 --> 7623.06
that they'd had to commit me or

7622.219 --> 7625.76
something

7623.06 --> 7629.119000000001
or that it would really be like you are

7625.76 --> 7633.34
you have serious like Criminal

7629.119 --> 7633.339999999999
mental issues no

7633.38 --> 7636.86
and I've never been foolish enough to

7635.239 --> 7641.48
like oh

7636.86 --> 7644.9
mentally ill I need medication to become

7641.48 --> 7647.739
normal now because I'm not a [ __ ]

7644.9 --> 7647.739
[ __ ]

7650.48 --> 7652.9
okay

7654.08 --> 7658.58
that's how you become a [ __ ] oh

7656.78 --> 7660.739
there's something wrong with me yeah

7658.58 --> 7663.739
yeah you have a thing that you need to

7660.739 --> 7667.54
develop and guess what that thing they

7663.739 --> 7670.759999999999
don't like that thing in the uniform

7667.54 --> 7672.86
homogeneous society

7670.76 --> 7674.719
yeah they don't like that so they're

7672.86 --> 7677.239
going to tell you that's not normal you

7674.719 --> 7679.46
have to take some suppressant to try to

7677.239 --> 7682.839999999999
get rid of it if you then take that

7679.46 --> 7682.84
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

7684.44 --> 7689.78
like really I totally disrespect people

7687.8 --> 7692.3
that do that

7689.78 --> 7695.84
you medicate yourself

7692.3 --> 7699.08
because you thought you needed to adapt

7695.84 --> 7700.88
you pathetic idiot

7699.08 --> 7706.0599999999995
you could have

7700.88 --> 7706.06
actually developed it yourself

7706.34 --> 7710.719
realize that there is a reason the way

7708.739 --> 7713.48
you are the way you are with those

7710.719 --> 7715.52
traits and deal with them and not be a

7713.48 --> 7717.32
[ __ ] coward all the time and run away

7715.52 --> 7719.8
for it and try to pretend it doesn't

7717.32 --> 7719.799999999999
exist

7722.06 --> 7726.38
in reality you need to embrace all the

7724.699 --> 7728.9
traits you have

7726.38 --> 7731.139
and deal with all the problems they

7728.9 --> 7731.138999999999
bring

7731.3 --> 7736.58
and you don't do that by trying to

7733.94 --> 7739.219
surgically remove them or suppress them

7736.58 --> 7741.38
forever forget about it yeah that's

7739.219 --> 7743.119
never the solution forget about it is

7741.38 --> 7745.04
never the solution

7743.119 --> 7746.719
it never is

7745.04 --> 7748.28
you need to work with it you need to

7746.719 --> 7751.88
understand why it's there you need to

7748.28 --> 7753.8
know how it works Master it to minimize

7751.88 --> 7757.099
any kind of negative

7753.8 --> 7760.88
results that it might bring

7757.099 --> 7762.619000000001
and then attain a better grip on the

7760.88 --> 7765.139
world doing that

7762.619 --> 7767.48
a better grip on the world than any kind

7765.139 --> 7770.0
of system that will be handed down to

7767.48 --> 7772.159
you in order to tell you oh this is how

7770.0 --> 7774.52
you interpret things yeah no no you

7772.159 --> 7777.799999999999
figure it out because you built yourself

7774.52 --> 7781.4800000000005
you fixed yourself

7777.8 --> 7784.76
where the system only wants to suppress

7781.48 --> 7787.718999999999
traits of yourself so that you don't

7784.76 --> 7787.719
Master yourself

7793.28 --> 7795.82
anyhow

7821.659 --> 7824.32
hmm

7827.5 --> 7830.569
[Music]

7830.599 --> 7834.46
what the hell am I going to call this

7832.28 --> 7834.46

it is a bit over the place

7864.2 --> 7867.38
[Music]

7878.9 --> 7883.5199999999995
you might batter somebody if they still

7880.88 --> 7885.5
here but really I'm appeal but will you

7883.52 --> 7888.320000000001
would you actively

7885.5 --> 7890.42
take their hand and Bash it into the

7888.32 --> 7892.9
pavement though would you let it get to

7890.42 --> 7892.9
that point

7894.04 --> 7897.04
foreign

7900.52 --> 7906.280000000001
that's what Craig did

7903.139 --> 7906.28
would you do that too

7937.34 --> 7943.84
that's right Banta

7940.159 --> 7943.839999999999
some interesting things to say

8096.4 --> 8101.82
a timeout

8097.9 --> 8101.82
kind of a [ __ ] up thing is not to say

8106.06 --> 8110.079000000001

8107.98 --> 8113.5599999999995
huh

8110.079 --> 8115.179
yeah it's it violence it's not violence

8113.56 --> 8117.400000000001
to think anything

8115.179 --> 8121.54
and thinking something definitely

8117.4 --> 8125.638999999999
doesn't justify retaliation

8121.54 --> 8125.639
[ __ ] like who the [ __ ] are you

8127.42 --> 8133.78
think I'm gonna just let some Ray apps

8165.76 --> 8168.4800000000005
hell says that

8168.579 --> 8171.88
violence if you think the Earth is a

8170.92 --> 8175.119
sphere

8171.88 --> 8177.159000000001
Justified retali television otherwise

8175.119 --> 8179.199
the [ __ ] says that

8177.159 --> 8181.659
except for a plant that's trying to

8179.199 --> 8184.799999999999
incite violence

8181.659 --> 8184.799999999999
the gray amps

8188.639 --> 8196.24

[Music]

8288.519 --> 8295.12
and you got a lot of the current new

8291.639 --> 8296.979
thing type of material too I mean so

8295.12 --> 8299.58
much has happened since your last video

8296.979 --> 8299.58
it's crazy

8301.78 --> 8307.5
you could pull all the Ukraine [ __ ]

8304.179 --> 8307.5
in there if you'd like or

8309.88 --> 8312.3
whatever

8313.78 --> 8320.820000000002
World economic Forum [ __ ]

8316.599 --> 8320.82
I mean look at all the options you got

8329.5 --> 8333.58
alternative history flat earth falls on

8331.66 --> 8335.439
the Wayside yeah I get that Darth I mean

8333.58 --> 8337.479
the same goes for me

8335.439 --> 8338.559000000001
it's called a flat Earth early bird show

8337.479 --> 8341.139
but

8338.559 --> 8345.039999999999
in reality I maybe talk about Flat Earth

8341.139 --> 8348.039999999999
like five percent of my time

8345.04 --> 8350.800000000001
because it's like yeah I've just kind of

8348.04 --> 8352.599
done I like I've what else can I even

8350.8 --> 8355.018999999998
say the only thing I can really do

8352.599 --> 8357.82
that's left for me to do is just like

8355.019 --> 8359.979
inform the newcomer

8357.82 --> 8364.859
when they ask because I feel like

8359.979 --> 8364.858999999999
developed every thing that I could

8366.519 --> 8372.219000000001
like about the whole looping system how

8368.74 --> 8375.039999999999
it can be looped how the realm could be

8372.219 --> 8377.919999999998
I've I've done it like there's no more

8375.04 --> 8379.179
left for me to develop there I can't

8377.92 --> 8381.939
think of anything

8379.179 --> 8385.439
else to develop that concerns

8381.939 --> 8385.439
the nature of the realm

8386.98 --> 8390.128999999999
[Music]

8393.64 --> 8399.16
you're happy the virus one is oh yeah

8395.92 --> 8402.12
yeah oh man did that hold up all right

8399.16 --> 8402.119999999999
indeed

8404.38 --> 8408.72
you could add geranism in there oh

8412.12 --> 8417.359
that could be so freaking funny

8418.6 --> 8426.16
dude you could have like Jaren over on

8422.92 --> 8428.14
uh what is the ball Earth debate I don't

8426.16 --> 8432.78
remember what it's called you could have

8428.14 --> 8436.599999999999
him over and then basically [ __ ] to

8432.78 --> 8438.640000000001
Ethan and the panel just like he cocked

8436.6 --> 8442.68
to mctoon

8438.64 --> 8446.619999999999
that would be epic

8442.68 --> 8448.6
that would be absolutely epic if you had

8446.62 --> 8451.54
that

8448.6 --> 8454.06
just watch mctoon

8451.54 --> 8456.34
the time he had Jared on this horror I

8454.06 --> 8459.039999999999
mean it's it's brutal to sit through

8456.34 --> 8461.26
that but you have like

8459.04 --> 8464.439
the perfect

8461.26 --> 8467.02
like parrot parody material for like

8464.439 --> 8468.76
having Jaron on the the ball Earth

8467.02 --> 8472.24
debate thing

8468.76 --> 8475.54
and then cocking to the ball Earth just

8472.24 --> 8480.6
like he does in at Neptunes I mean

8475.54 --> 8480.6
you could do it I bet you could Darth

8492.939 --> 8497.380000000001
my explanation about using seven over

8495.22 --> 8500.679999999998
six are to justify flat Baseline for

8497.38 --> 8503.438999999998
Celestial navigation is perfect

8500.68 --> 8506.439
I feel truly honored that you picked up

8503.439 --> 8509.979000000001
on that thank you

8506.439 --> 8512.14
yes I know Baldwin always wins that's

8509.979 --> 8514.179999999998
why he's called win that's why it's a

8512.14 --> 8517.96
ball win because

8514.18 --> 8520.960000000001
when I do that it wins nobody can

8517.96 --> 8523.24
Dethrone of all belief

8520.96 --> 8527.199999999999
there's always a way through

8523.24 --> 8529.539999999999
no matter how ridiculous it might seem

8527.2 --> 8530.859
right but you don't need to resort to

8529.54 --> 8533.02
double speak

8530.859 --> 8536.26
you don't need to do that you just need

8533.02 --> 8538.300000000001
to get unbelievably convoluted

8536.26 --> 8541.66
and it'll work out

8538.3 --> 8545.858999999999
right you don't catch Baldwin double

8541.66 --> 8549.399
speaking I don't need to do that you see

8545.859 --> 8552.28
the double speak is a sign of poor grip

8549.399 --> 8554.38
of poor oversight it's it's a sign of

8552.28 --> 8557.380000000001
poor cohesion

8554.38 --> 8559.3
it's weakness when you double speak I

8557.38 --> 8561.039999999999
don't need to double speak I just figure

8559.3 --> 8564.58
a way through and yeah it might be

8561.04 --> 8567.220000000001
ridiculous but it'll seem to work

8564.58 --> 8569.2
and that's all you really need

8567.22 --> 8570.699999999999
so yeah I feel really honored that you

8569.2 --> 8575.220000000001

8570.7 --> 8575.220000000001
Nathan got all really frustrated

8587.38 --> 8590.38
foreign

8603.939 --> 8608.26
oh you might also make want to make a

8606.28 --> 8611.02
joke where Nathan is gonna Grill

8608.26 --> 8615.52
somebody and other people Jitter through

8611.02 --> 8617.380000000001
it and it's like G Plus shut up and then

8615.52 --> 8619.78
the name but always get the name wrong

8617.38 --> 8621.58
Nathan always gets the name who he says

8619.78 --> 8623.2
is interrupting he needs to shut up he

8621.58 --> 8625.24
always gets it wrong

8623.2 --> 8627.479000000001
you could use that too that would be

8625.24 --> 8627.479
funny

8635.8 --> 8642.039999999999
oh man I'm looking forward I've missed

8638.74 --> 8645.119999999999
your I gotta watch it back I mean those

8642.04 --> 8645.12
shows were so funny

8646.66 --> 8651.22
so yeah if you if you haven't checked it

8648.7 --> 8652.960000000001
out go to Darth Channel he's in the chat

8651.22 --> 8654.46

8652.96 --> 8658.5
check out

8654.46 --> 8658.5
the what the [ __ ] is the name again

8661.42 --> 8665.859
yeah Globe Earth dictate

8664.06 --> 8667.84
check out the globe Earth dictate

8665.859 --> 8670.08
there's three three shows they're so

8667.84 --> 8670.08
funny

8682.3 --> 8685.96
so a couple of low hanging things like

8684.76 --> 8689.1
super chess that you haven't

8685.96 --> 8689.099999999999
Incorporated right

8689.319 --> 8693.06
well you should have like a

8694.479 --> 8699.46
like a Godzilla

8697.24 --> 8700.72
like guard sale is always like doing

8699.46 --> 8704.019999999999
weird

8700.72 --> 8708.22
goofy comments and jokes and sometimes

8704.02 --> 8709.960000000001
being a bit rebellious you you know what

8708.22 --> 8714.22
you're doing you know better what you're

8709.96 --> 8716.14
doing than I do with what you're doing

8714.22 --> 8718.74
but yeah there's so much development

8716.14 --> 8721.92
that you can incorporate

8718.74 --> 8725.26
Neil involved yes

8721.92 --> 8727.859
you just make him somebody that just

8725.26 --> 8727.859
makes noise

8742.54 --> 8749.880000000001
maybe you could call him heel

8745.66 --> 8752.859
like the boot stomping on a head forever

8749.88 --> 8755.019999999999
like use that picture boot on a head

8752.859 --> 8757.24
forever and then call him heel

8755.02 --> 8759.58
and he's like a really aggressive guy

8757.24 --> 8762.28
that just wants to freaking choke

8759.58 --> 8764.16
everybody that disagrees with him

8762.28 --> 8768.04
call him heel

8764.16 --> 8770.819
with the picture of a boots

8768.04 --> 8770.819000000001
how about that

8772.42 --> 8776.58
yeah we're brainstorming right now

8777.81 --> 8784.3
[Music]

8780.6 --> 8787.12
right because it is dystopian themed

8784.3 --> 8788.5
right basically the show so yeah I'm

8787.12 --> 8790.899000000001
thinking with you if you want a new

8788.5 --> 8794.34
character call him heel

8790.899 --> 8794.34
and super aggressive

8803.16 --> 8808.119999999999
they could even pull it as far as that

8805.72 --> 8813.96
he gets goes on rage berserk and it's

8808.12 --> 8813.960000000001
like like yo yo shut up and he was like

8814.0 --> 8818.04
did you hear that like okay

8818.2 --> 8823.319000000001
in some Therapeutics something like that

8837.939 --> 8842.1
okay oh please not no no

8844.12 --> 8848.140000000001
okay as long as you make Legolas

8846.16 --> 8850.96
homophobic

8848.14 --> 8852.519999999999
that then it's okay I accept if you're

8850.96 --> 8855.938999999998
gonna do that as long as you make

8852.52 --> 8858.66
Legolas homophobic I demand that like

8855.939 --> 8858.66
that's my condition

8871.3 --> 8876.22
they debate the Earth's sexuality

8879.52 --> 8886.26
they want the Moon to transition to it

8882.46 --> 8886.259999999998
so that is really funny dude

8896.02 --> 8900.78
make him flaming because he has to be in

8898.66 --> 8900.78
one

8905.68 --> 8910.78
okay well as long as you don't make Lego

8908.14 --> 8913.24
less gay

8910.78 --> 8915.76
and and like

8913.24 --> 8918.34
mention somehow that he's homophobic

8915.76 --> 8921.399
make Ethan say it like oh

8918.34 --> 8923.56
Lagos do we know you're all homophobic

8921.399 --> 8924.88
so you might just want to stay out of

8923.56 --> 8928.56
this one

8924.88 --> 8928.56
like something like that please

8929.8 --> 8933.358999999999
can be homophobic good

8933.819 --> 8939.479
that's all good excellent then I'm then

8936.28 --> 8939.479000000001
it's okay then I accept

8943.01 --> 8946.2
[Music]

8950.14 --> 8953.449999999999
[Music]

8955.54 --> 8961.62
four videos I'm like wow

8958.96 --> 8961.619999999999
really

8977.93 --> 8984.52
[Music]

8981.76 --> 8987.460000000001
wow I'm glad to hear that you're like

8984.52 --> 8989.800000000001
getting inspiration again I mean

8987.46 --> 8993.72
I really missed those videos it's been a

8989.8 --> 8993.72
while how many years has it been now

8995.319 --> 9002.88
40 hours to Mike yeah I believe really

8998.859 --> 9006.319
you make them in only 40 hours really

9002.88 --> 9006.319
that's really quick

9006.42 --> 9011.6
with like the details you got in there

9008.52 --> 9011.6
that's incredibly quick

9014.16 --> 9019.1
every time light flashes their own yeah

9016.2 --> 9019.1
I bet they are

9031.14 --> 9037.34
so anyway yeah looking for it

9034.439 --> 9037.34
foreign

9081.859 --> 9086.460000000001
movie making is incredibly slow and

9085.38 --> 9089.46
tedious

9086.46 --> 9092.22
and that's Universal it's like all the

9089.46 --> 9094.8
edited videos like always take so much

9092.22 --> 9098.96
more time to build than they take the

9094.8 --> 9098.96
play and that's always been like that

9101.1 --> 9103.7
yeah

9103.76 --> 9109.26
can you imagine like how much time is

9106.68 --> 9111.899
actually spent on like making a Disney

9109.26 --> 9115.08
full movie or something like the better

9111.899 --> 9120.24
ones like holy [ __ ] like yeah that's one

9115.08 --> 9122.52
half hour movie well they spent like

9120.24 --> 9124.859
why this is like a hundred thousand

9122.52 --> 9126.899000000001
hours on that

9124.859 --> 9130.380000000001
that's crazy

9126.899 --> 9134.039999999999
so much like the animated stuff so much

9130.38 --> 9136.38
work it's insane like one frame could

9134.04 --> 9140.42
they could spend like

9136.38 --> 9140.42
three hours on one frame

9142.02 --> 9146.7
if it's an important one right

9144.3 --> 9149.88
yeah it's always like that I don't have

9146.7 --> 9152.58
that problem because I do it live I do

9149.88 --> 9156.5
it always lie but I do everything live

9152.58 --> 9156.5
so I don't have that issue

9160.88 --> 9164.599999999999
MCU movie yeah yeah

9173.359 --> 9178.62
you use Premiere 10 years old hey if it

9176.46 --> 9182.819
still works it works right

9178.62 --> 9184.68
I mean I use Photoshop from 2007. it

9182.819 --> 9187.08
works great

9184.68 --> 9189.74
and it's free

9187.08 --> 9189.74
legally

9200.49 --> 9203.61
[Music]

9211.26 --> 9218.819
when you talk about how bad cgis

9214.7 --> 9221.76
yeah well those are mostly just whiny

9218.819 --> 9224.34
Gammas right

9221.76 --> 9227.28
so you my wine again must have

9224.34 --> 9229.92
absolutely no nothing to hold them back

9227.28 --> 9232.5
from basically showing off how

9229.92 --> 9236.460000000001
incredibly whiny they are

9232.5 --> 9238.56
well the majority of people are like meh

9236.46 --> 9241.919999999998
it's not really worth complaining about

9238.56 --> 9243.359
I mean this is just how it is right you

9241.92 --> 9245.52
always get to see the whiny people

9243.359 --> 9247.08
online those are the ones you get to

9245.52 --> 9250.560000000001
bump into those are the comments you're

9247.08 --> 9253.2
reading it's all the whiny people

9250.56 --> 9254.64
so it's not an accurate reflection you

9253.2 --> 9256.859
always have to keep that in mind or

9254.64 --> 9259.8
you're gonna like the world's gonna turn

9256.859 --> 9262.439
really sour if you don't pick up on that

9259.8 --> 9263.519999999999
because you mostly get to see the

9262.439 --> 9267.12
whiners

9263.52 --> 9270.439
mostly Grabbers grabblers and

9267.12 --> 9270.439
just whiny people

9270.96 --> 9275.699999999999
they aren't actually the majority of

9273.6 --> 9278.34
people thank God

9275.7 --> 9280.0
the world would not last very long if it

9278.34 --> 9283.19
was

9280.0 --> 9283.19

but I guess you could come on if you

9336.0 --> 9338.24

remember

9784.26 --> 9788.84
you're either real mental disorder

9786.12 --> 9788.84
person are you

9789.479 --> 9793.5
or just because you have different

9791.16 --> 9795.78
accounts

9793.5 --> 9797.76
I mean sometimes it's really handy to

9795.78 --> 9798.84
not be identified when you go around

9797.76 --> 9800.28
because

9798.84 --> 9802.439
especially if you have a bit of

9800.28 --> 9804.66
reputation people treat you differently

9802.439 --> 9806.939
and then what you get to see is natural

9804.66 --> 9810.18
so it's actually very normal for

9806.939 --> 9814.62
intelligent people to have

9810.18 --> 9818.1
like alternative unknown avatars

9814.62 --> 9821.28
so they get to see things as they are

9818.1 --> 9824.479000000001
instead of as how they would be if they

9821.28 --> 9824.479000000001
were representing themselves

9835.319 --> 9842.06
oh you were kidding

9837.359 --> 9842.06
okay well I responded literal like I do

9854.399 --> 9859.56
if you don't use this account because

9856.26 --> 9862.74
it's supposed to be a blower

9859.56 --> 9865.14
yeah but I mean Darth I mean

9862.74 --> 9868.88
there's no actual globers out there that

9865.14 --> 9868.88
really believe that you're a real Glover

9871.439 --> 9876.06
I mean you must be like really out of

9874.02 --> 9878.76
your mind to to be a glober and then

9876.06 --> 9881.3
think that you are actually

9878.76 --> 9881.300000000001
I mean

9882.78 --> 9886.92
have you had that as a response have you

9884.64 --> 9889.92
had comments like that

9886.92 --> 9895.2
I kind of doubt it

9889.92 --> 9895.2
but baby you did maybe I uh overestimate

9895.5 --> 9899.399
or underestimate how dumb certain people

9898.02 --> 9902.18
can be

9899.399 --> 9902.18
I don't know

9924.3 --> 9927.979
well I don't look

9928.56 --> 9933.899
Insanity would be that you don't really

9931.5 --> 9935.88
properly know what is what that's really

9933.899 --> 9938.399
insanity

9935.88 --> 9940.438999999998
you seem to very much be aware what is

9938.399 --> 9942.539999999999
what so that's not Insanity now that

9940.439 --> 9944.06
might be that you have

9942.54 --> 9946.439
like

9944.06 --> 9948.859
extravagant traits or what do you call

9946.439 --> 9948.859
it the

9952.02 --> 9957.74
that sort of thing uh yeah what's the

9954.78 --> 9960.0
word for that again damn it

9957.74 --> 9961.68
extravagant traits it's one thing but

9960.0 --> 9963.66
that doesn't make you insane it just

9961.68 --> 9966.78
makes you

9963.66 --> 9969.72
a little out of the ordinary

9966.78 --> 9972.0
insanity is like you don't understand

9969.72 --> 9973.679999999998
what reality really is that's real

9972.0 --> 9976.56
insanity

9973.68 --> 9978.6
the lost track of what is real

9976.56 --> 9981.08
I don't think you actually lost track of

9978.6 --> 9981.08
what is real

10009.28 --> 10016.7
David Rice copy claim your videos

10013.7 --> 10016.7
wow

10016.819 --> 10019.6
okay

10024.439 --> 10029.6
what a dick

10027.26 --> 10031.78
I mean it's literally advertisement for

10029.6 --> 10031.78
him

10046.12 --> 10049.640000000001
[Music]

10048.02 --> 10051.859
like why the hell would he even do that

10049.64 --> 10056.3
to some other channel

10051.859 --> 10059.359
that's like fan making fan based stuff

10056.3 --> 10063.519999999999
is he afraid he's gonna lose money

10059.359 --> 10063.52
I don't get it why would he even do that

10084.26 --> 10089.12
some of them got huge views you mean

10086.72 --> 10093.279999999999
those mirrors from David Wise that you

10089.12 --> 10093.28
posted they got huge views did they

10093.74 --> 10096.34
hmm

10106.52 --> 10109.24
right

10111.68 --> 10117.800000000001
okay North sure

10115.04 --> 10120.859
I never get any of that type of levels I

10117.8 --> 10123.92
don't even know why why

10120.859 --> 10127.24
would that sort of stuff the mirror of

10123.92 --> 10127.24
it get so many views

10132.38 --> 10139.0
get like 300 views at best I don't know

10136.64 --> 10139.0
why

10140.66 --> 10145.28
because some of my videos are really

10143.06 --> 10149.859
good

10145.28 --> 10149.859
I don't know why it doesn't go higher

10152.53 --> 10159.839

10265.819 --> 10270.859
it's probably gonna be 1 30 a lot this

10268.58 --> 10272.72
week only this week because there's no

10270.859 --> 10275.24

10285.62 --> 10290.02
there so hope to find you there in the

10287.84 --> 10290.02
chat

10292.22 --> 10295.88
right

10293.479 --> 10297.979
so thanks everyone for coming

10299.78 --> 10304.220000000001
up and if you haven't already subscribed

10302.42 --> 10307.28
to my channel hit the Bell notification

10304.22 --> 10309.199999999999
so you know when I'm going live which is

10307.28 --> 10311.24
normally 1pm Amsterdam time in a

10309.2 --> 10313.880000000001
weekdays and 2 p.m Amsterdam time in the

10311.24 --> 10316.58
weekend and please also do support me

10313.88 --> 10318.5
through the PayPal and patreon they'll

10316.58 --> 10321.92
be much appreciated and

10318.5 --> 10323.779
yeah still directly needed so any more

10321.92 --> 10326.14
support will be yeah it's going to be

10323.779 --> 10326.140000000001
necessary

10326.18 --> 10332.779
I'm good for like the next few days but

10329.359 --> 10334.640000000001
yeah that's just the next few days

10332.779 --> 10336.02
it's going to be a bit tough this month

10334.64 --> 10337.88
I think

10336.02 --> 10339.979000000001
but maybe at some point like the

10337.88 --> 10342.08
government's gonna send me like a bonus

10339.979 --> 10344.3
it's not really a bonus because of like

10342.08 --> 10347.0
the crazy pricing

10344.3 --> 10349.039999999999
they do actually compensate that

10347.0 --> 10350.72
at least if you have social welfare they

10349.04 --> 10352.819000000001
do

10350.72 --> 10355.519999999999
because it's like yeah the money you

10352.819 --> 10358.58
actually get is not sufficient anymore

10355.52 --> 10359.899000000001
and they know that it's like not our

10358.58 --> 10361.7
fault

10359.899 --> 10365.539999999999
if they don't compensate it then like

10361.7 --> 10367.939
there will be like giant amount of

10365.54 --> 10370.160000000002
people going bust and [ __ ] and that's

10367.939 --> 10372.439
really bad for the economy so they're

10370.16 --> 10376.539999999999
doing this as a short-term solution

10372.439 --> 10376.54
sometimes and it is necessary

10377.84 --> 10380.72
so I kind of hope I'm getting one of

10379.64 --> 10383.358999999999
those soon

10380.72 --> 10386.26
lucky last year it happened also during

10383.359 --> 10386.26
September

10386.38 --> 10390.58
anyway

10388.22 --> 10393.08
until that time I'm gonna have to

10390.58 --> 10394.939
manage somehow with the support that I

10393.08 --> 10398.12
get from you guys

10394.939 --> 10401.359
and I really yeah I appreciate that you

10398.12 --> 10403.52
do keep supporting me so

10401.359 --> 10405.399000000001
right I'll be back tomorrow with flat

10403.52 --> 10408.74
Earth early bird number

10405.399 --> 10410.479
1712 on a Wednesday hope to see you all

10408.74 --> 10413.84
there

10410.479 --> 10417.019999999999
again uh yeah in between expect me to be

10413.84 --> 10419.779
a bit late so 1 30 let's just say 1 30.

10417.02 --> 10421.640000000001
I might start sooner though but I'm just

10419.779 --> 10423.02
saying it's it's likely I'm gonna be

10421.64 --> 10424.88
more late

10423.02 --> 10426.859
because

10424.88 --> 10429.14
I can just move beyond the normal

10426.859 --> 10431.960000000001
stopping point now because Nathan's not

10429.14 --> 10434.3
