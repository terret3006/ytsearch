working myself in more debt which

[Music]

so it is kind of moist but it's not

121.04 --> 123.43900000000001

i'm gonna have to do my newspapers

134.239 --> 143.12

at all upvotes

185.04 --> 191.84
one down vote sure sure anyway youtube

188.4 --> 193.12
and their votes on videos don't make a

191.84 --> 196.56
lick of sense

193.12 --> 196.56
but yeah sure

197.28 --> 204.4
octopus learner no

200.64 --> 204.39999999999998
agm i kind of forgot about it

204.72 --> 209.44
and yeah you didn't send me a link in

206.799 --> 213.84
the chat that i think

209.44 --> 213.84
oh wait you might have

214.799 --> 219.28
oh no no right because it was on netflix

217.92 --> 222.95899999999997
yeah i didn't watch any netflix

219.28 --> 222.959
yesterday it didn't feel like it at all

223.44 --> 231.12
uh hey hello obamacall

227.2 --> 233.35999999999999
all right so

231.12 --> 233.36
ah

234.4 --> 238.84
pretty late night last night

237.78 --> 241.04
[Music]

238.84 --> 243.519
uh

241.04 --> 245.2
and yeah i don't know this weather man

243.519 --> 248.48000000000002
it's just

245.2 --> 249.92
my back and my jaw or whatever it is i

248.48 --> 253.04
can't even pinpoint it

249.92 --> 255.92
it really must be the bone because

253.04 --> 257.919
even when i like carefully massage the

255.92 --> 258.639
muscles which do seem to get a little

257.919 --> 260.479
tense but

258.639 --> 262.56
yeah it seems more like it's secondary

260.479 --> 266.56
it's more from the tension

262.56 --> 269.199
somewhere in my jaw that that happens

266.56 --> 270.16
but yeah this is annoying for me but i'm

269.199 --> 273.84000000000003
used to that

270.16 --> 276.8
or i should be it's more like oh

273.84 --> 278.4
what is this oh [ __ ] it's that again

276.8 --> 279.52000000000004
because when i don't have it i kind of

278.4 --> 282.32
forget about it

279.52 --> 283.919
because it's just annoying but i'll get

282.32 --> 287.36
over it

283.919 --> 288.479
it's not that terrible i got the right

287.36 --> 291.6
supplements

288.479 --> 293.52
which i know typically help like vitamin

291.6 --> 296.16
d3 and all that

293.52 --> 298.96
it it helps a lot against this it's

296.16 --> 302.40000000000003
interesting how that works

298.96 --> 306.23999999999995
but i got enough of that uh hey roger

302.4 --> 309.59999999999997
amanda young good to see you too

306.24 --> 312.96000000000004
hmm where's good servant

309.6 --> 316.16
he's usually in quite fast i can

312.96 --> 316.15999999999997
maybe add a late night

318.479 --> 325.84
right so i got tamara coffee with me

321.759 --> 325.84000000000003
and green tea

328.96 --> 331.919
and i got some notes

333.039 --> 338.32
so yeah i didn't watch

336.4 --> 339.84
yesterday's show back but i thought it

338.32 --> 343.52
was pretty good

339.84 --> 345.28
from what i remember although yeah it's

343.52 --> 346.88
always funny how that works out when i

345.28 --> 350.479
start a new show i kind of forget

346.88 --> 352.24
everything i don't know why maybe it's

350.479 --> 354.32
because i'm kind of feeling like i'm

352.24 --> 357.36
being put on the spot

354.32 --> 359.44
maybe it's similar to like

357.36 --> 361.28000000000003
how people get on stage and then forget

359.44 --> 364.319
everything forget all their lines

361.28 --> 364.63899999999995
i think it's that effect except because

364.319 --> 367.36
i

364.639 --> 368.40000000000003
improvise everything there's nothing

367.36 --> 371.44
really

368.4 --> 374.23999999999995
memorized that i'm forgetting

371.44 --> 375.36
i'm just like oh i can't reach my

374.24 --> 378.56
informations

375.36 --> 380.639
as easily but then i get into it

378.56 --> 382.479
and then i get reminded by a few people

380.639 --> 386.24
and then i get it all back

382.479 --> 386.24
so yeah it seems to happen a lot to me

388.72 --> 397.6
but yeah what was it again

394.16 --> 399.12
earth debate i didn't even write that

397.6 --> 403.52000000000004
down that's weird

399.12 --> 405.759
uh flattered today was very good

403.52 --> 406.71999999999997
and yeah yesterday apparently the whole

405.759 --> 410.639
day was just

406.72 --> 412.88000000000005
themed after weight and gravity

410.639 --> 415.68
so we talked about that extensively in

412.88 --> 418.96
the flat earth debate

415.68 --> 420.24
relative density again what does uh this

418.96 --> 423.35999999999996
guy

420.24 --> 423.68
add misunderstanding it on purpose and

423.36 --> 426.319
just

423.68 --> 428.24
going with the same stupid simon dan

426.319 --> 429.44
argument apparently that simon dan thing

428.24 --> 432.08
now he really

429.44 --> 433.12
put it down officially that relative

432.08 --> 435.12
density means that

433.12 --> 436.56
things go in a relative direction and

435.12 --> 438.4
all that nonsense

436.56 --> 439.68
so that was cleared up and then later in

438.4 --> 442.79999999999995
the evening

439.68 --> 443.44
qe live didn't realize it was really

442.8 --> 445.44
live

443.44 --> 446.96
but yeah when it went live i got on

445.44 --> 451.68
there

446.96 --> 456.15999999999997
and was a damn good show was really good

451.68 --> 459.28000000000003
and i got to put in some very concise

456.16 --> 461.12
explanation really focused very proud of

459.28 --> 462.88
that

461.12 --> 464.8
and yeah afterward i also had a good

462.88 --> 466.96
talk and that was in the flat of debate

464.8 --> 469.44
too it was very long afterward and oh

466.96 --> 469.44
yeah yeah

469.599 --> 473.599
i got back with with brian and chocolate

473.039 --> 476.71999999999997
in the

473.599 --> 478.8
after chat which we typically do and

476.72 --> 479.84000000000003
yeah the situation from yesterday got

478.8 --> 481.91900000000004
brought up

479.84 --> 484.08
almost got into a fight again because i

481.919 --> 486.31899999999996
was still just

484.08 --> 487.52
still a bit outraged but yeah sleeping

486.319 --> 490.16
warrior the ultimate

487.52 --> 493.19899999999996
flat earth debate diplomat he got in

490.16 --> 495.759
there and he kind of like

493.199 --> 497.28000000000003
tried to smoothen it down a little like

495.759 --> 499.68
he gets it he gets

497.28 --> 501.44
why i am the way i am he doesn't always

499.68 --> 502.479
know why but he does understand how it

501.44 --> 505.199
works

502.479 --> 506.639
it's very wise at it these kind of

505.199 --> 510.24
social issues

506.639 --> 513.519
and he gets me so he kind of like yeah

510.24 --> 514.5600000000001
just try again come now i was like shut

513.519 --> 517.039
up

514.56 --> 519.8389999999999
i'm not gonna calm down and then i

517.039 --> 524.08
waited a moment and then i calmed

519.839 --> 526.399
got back in there and yeah

524.08 --> 527.9200000000001
revealed basically why i got so agitated

526.399 --> 529.839
it was because i was

527.92 --> 532.8389999999999
thinking they were going down a

529.839 --> 534.1600000000001
physicality assumption by a strain of

532.839 --> 536.399
thought

534.16 --> 537.6
and then they basically fed back like no

536.399 --> 540.8
not really

537.6 --> 544.64
they just got a bit bit

540.8 --> 546.64
overly flexible they weren't set

544.64 --> 548.72
so they were just juggling around with

546.64 --> 550.72
options but in a in a fashion that

548.72 --> 552.24
seemed very chaotic to me

550.72 --> 556.1600000000001
and that's why i thought like what are

552.24 --> 559.6
you going with literal position again

556.16 --> 560.16
of the light origin um well we discussed

559.6 --> 562.48
it

560.16 --> 564.48
pretty elaborately must have been an

562.48 --> 568.08
hour in total

564.48 --> 570.48
and yeah we got out of that situation

568.08 --> 572.88
so personal thanks to uh sleeping

570.48 --> 572.88
warrior

573.12 --> 582.08
for being a great friend and a diplomat

578.72 --> 584.8000000000001
hey julie of heaven nathan oakley 1980

582.08 --> 584.8000000000001
good to see you

584.88 --> 591.8389999999999
right uh

587.92 --> 597.36
yeah then qe live good show

591.839 --> 597.36
and yeah it was nice

598.32 --> 601.6
and i think i've been doing pretty good

600.72 --> 605.76
too

601.6 --> 607.9200000000001
despite like me having like nuisances

605.76 --> 609.76
that distract me it doesn't seem to

607.92 --> 611.1999999999999
distract me that much when i'm actually

609.76 --> 613.6
doing the

611.2 --> 615.279
the shows and when i'm being part of

613.6 --> 619.12
trains of thinking and all that

615.279 --> 622.0
so yeah doing quite good

619.12 --> 623.04
uh right after that though i kind of

622.0 --> 626.079
dropped the whole

623.04 --> 629.36
social media scene and started to play

626.079 --> 630.16
a game again reinstall it had it had a

629.36 --> 633.92
blue screen

630.16 --> 636.399
from it was weird some issues

633.92 --> 638.7199999999999
but yeah it's fun to play it again after

636.399 --> 641.839
after it what is it a year

638.72 --> 643.36
xcom 2 has its issues like there's a lot

641.839 --> 645.12
of loading times that's like

643.36 --> 647.839
really annoying if it didn't had that it

645.12 --> 651.279
would have been like an amazing game

647.839 --> 652.9300000000001
you know but it's still pretty

651.279 --> 655.279
it's fun to play

652.93 --> 658.88
[Music]

655.279 --> 661.8389999999999
and i yeah took my time with that and

658.88 --> 663.2
got pretty late right this morning i saw

661.839 --> 667.36
a glimpse of a mark

663.2 --> 670.0
sergeant video didn't see it live

667.36 --> 671.36
but yeah apparently he caught a facebook

670.0 --> 674.079
page of uh

671.36 --> 675.92
facebook post of one of his neighbor

674.079 --> 678.64
ladies somewhere

675.92 --> 678.64
oh hold on

688.8 --> 692.88
and who went into like i'm a hater which

691.519 --> 695.2
was just

692.88 --> 696.8
totally absurd the whole thing she went

695.2 --> 701.2
into fallen

696.8 --> 703.76
cnn narrative sjw rage against

701.2 --> 706.0790000000001
the unnamed person which is obviously by

703.76 --> 709.8389999999999
the narrative recognizable as

706.079 --> 709.8389999999999
orange man of course

709.92 --> 713.12
but yeah it was been weird to see mark

712.32 --> 715.9200000000001
sargent say

713.12 --> 717.36
something like i don't have any more

715.92 --> 719.04
hope for peace

717.36 --> 720.9590000000001
that's very um that's like out of

719.04 --> 724.0
character for him

720.959 --> 725.4399999999999
it was a bit weird but yeah

724.0 --> 727.839
may have a point you know things are

725.44 --> 731.839
really pretty damn crazy

727.839 --> 731.839
and it's not just the usa by the way

732.32 --> 736.72
things are getting pretty crazy in the

733.839 --> 736.72
netherlands as well

736.88 --> 744.079
trying to keep tabs of the the dutch

739.68 --> 748.88
alternative news site

744.079 --> 748.88
our administration is all up to

749.839 --> 753.44
and it's just bad news

755.2 --> 763.9200000000001
it's like more they want more censorship

760.24 --> 766.48
and just like

763.92 --> 768.0
basically dictating what is reality they

766.48 --> 769.6800000000001
want that power

768.0 --> 773.04
they really want that power and they're

769.68 --> 775.92
doing it through censorship and

773.04 --> 778.24
bullying just outright bullying of the

775.92 --> 780.7199999999999
public

778.24 --> 781.76
and even though we don't have a well

780.72 --> 784.9590000000001
overall

781.76 --> 788.88
big problematic lockdown situation

784.959 --> 791.5999999999999
we're still being somewhat pushed around

788.88 --> 793.6
stupid bureaucracy running concerning

791.6 --> 797.6800000000001
the corona situation

793.6 --> 797.6800000000001
and it's it's everybody's sick of it

797.76 --> 801.4399999999999
but they're trying to like double down

799.92 --> 803.8389999999999
anyway even though they've been

801.44 --> 806.32
mild compared to some countries that are

803.839 --> 809.44
just outrageously

806.32 --> 811.2
responding with total lockdowns and just

809.44 --> 812.1600000000001
beating of civilians because they're not

811.2 --> 814.0790000000001
wearing a mask

812.16 --> 815.36
that's not really happening here

814.079 --> 819.76
although we have had

815.36 --> 820.72
military reinforcements during specific

819.76 --> 824.16
protests

820.72 --> 827.12
which is very creepy and

824.16 --> 829.279
yeah and still open sympathizing with

827.12 --> 831.12
organizations like blm of certain

829.279 --> 834.88
ministers as well it's just like

831.12 --> 834.88
are you out of your mind

835.199 --> 838.399
like everybody knows what that is right

837.44 --> 840.839
now

838.399 --> 843.839
you think you can really get away with

840.839 --> 843.839
that

843.92 --> 848.079
it's it's pretty it's getting pretty

846.0 --> 852.0
revolting and you can really see it

848.079 --> 853.92
on the faces of these officials

852.0 --> 855.839
the ministers that are doing this like

853.92 --> 858.959
they they're like

855.839 --> 862.48
visibly turning into goblins the way

858.959 --> 862.4799999999999
their faces are expressed

862.56 --> 866.959
and they're like some of them are really

864.56 --> 870.079
getting that hostile look like

866.959 --> 872.88
we're gonna get you like you're serious

870.079 --> 872.88
it's [ __ ] up

873.12 --> 876.16
but yeah there's plenty of dutch people

874.959 --> 879.279
i think that are on

876.16 --> 882.639
on like straight on track of this

879.279 --> 885.279
all and i'm my attitude is like

882.639 --> 886.5600000000001
yeah if anybody needs my help out there

885.279 --> 888.24
in some way

886.56 --> 890.7199999999999
you know you can contact me although i

888.24 --> 892.88
get the feeling you probably got it

890.72 --> 894.9590000000001
and i'm a little bit too weird for the

892.88 --> 896.32
situation anyway with my flat earth and

894.959 --> 899.5999999999999
all that

896.32 --> 904.32
i get that but

899.6 --> 906.48
yeah like i don't wanna afterward

904.32 --> 907.6
come to the realization i did nothing

906.48 --> 911.04
and now the country

907.6 --> 915.0400000000001
is literally a soviet state like that's

911.04 --> 918.16
i i don't want that so please do

915.04 --> 921.279
if something important requires my

918.16 --> 922.88
specific attention or my actions in a

921.279 --> 925.199
way that are suited for

922.88 --> 927.8389999999999
what i can do my skill range then please

925.199 --> 930.079
let me know

927.839 --> 933.0400000000001
like if you need somebody to get really

930.079 --> 936.56
fired up on stage

933.04 --> 940.399
yeah i i i do it

936.56 --> 942.7199999999999
i can do it for example

940.399 --> 945.199
if if it yeah if it makes sense if it's

942.72 --> 948.72
not too political if it is like a really

945.199 --> 949.279
direct thing and i've done it before by

948.72 --> 951.0400000000001
the way

949.279 --> 953.04
but it was very weird back then because

951.04 --> 956.079
i was kind of like

953.04 --> 960.0
undercover for myself

956.079 --> 961.5999999999999
because i i wasn't yeah i perceived like

960.0 --> 963.44
i was on the other side

961.6 --> 965.12
it's very weird how that was but yeah i

963.44 --> 966.24
would join the protest that was a long

965.12 --> 969.279
time ago

966.24 --> 972.399
and then i basically weren't like yeah

969.279 --> 975.519
it was about something back then

972.399 --> 978.24
much milder about labor

975.519 --> 980.5600000000001
it was a labor protest from labour party

978.24 --> 982.399
in the netherlands and

980.56 --> 984.7199999999999
like we have to do something for this

982.399 --> 985.68
and that and the government is getting

984.72 --> 989.0400000000001
problematic

985.68 --> 991.4399999999999
because of 9 11 and the wars are wrong

989.04 --> 994.3199999999999
and then i got in there like yes yes

991.44 --> 997.9200000000001
we're being taken over by nazis

994.32 --> 1001.12
like and they were like uh what

997.92 --> 1003.759
and i was like yeah yeah no it's not

1001.12 --> 1005.04
it's not the people it's the government

1003.759 --> 1007.1990000000001
that are pretending to be

1005.04 --> 1008.7199999999999
all liberal and all are having our best

1007.199 --> 1010.399
interests but at the same time there are

1008.72 --> 1015.1990000000001
nazis they are

1010.399 --> 1017.519
fascists and it is kind of odd because

1015.199 --> 1019.5999999999999
yeah somebody the way i looked back then

1017.519 --> 1021.12
and felt i could have been mistaken for

1019.6 --> 1024.319
like a

1021.12 --> 1026.88
uh an antifa person or something not as

1024.319 --> 1028.24
bad as they tend to look these days but

1026.88 --> 1031.439
yeah

1028.24 --> 1034.64
but what i said was kind of too

1031.439 --> 1037.3600000000001
real for that it's like

1034.64 --> 1038.16
jump the narrative standard for that

1037.36 --> 1041.4389999999999
[ __ ]

1038.16 --> 1042.799
so they were like what they didn't know

1041.439 --> 1044.48
what to think about it and then

1042.799 --> 1046.4
eventually i was like okay

1044.48 --> 1049.039
okay nobody seems to be getting this

1046.4 --> 1052.3200000000002
i'll just go away again

1049.039 --> 1055.2
it was interesting i think

1052.32 --> 1056.6399999999999
right when was that so it's a long time

1055.2 --> 1061.2
ago

1056.64 --> 1064.4
i think in 2006 or something

1061.2 --> 1069.3600000000001
i don't know it's a long time ago

1064.4 --> 1071.679
but yeah i don't want to be uh caught

1069.36 --> 1074.08
sitting around while the country turns

1071.679 --> 1081.8400000000001
into a hell hole

1074.08 --> 1081.84
for me that's unacceptable

1086.0 --> 1092.559
socialism leads to communism no no

1088.72 --> 1092.559
george sanford not necessarily

1093.44 --> 1098.0
it's complicated the thing is about

1095.6 --> 1099.28
socialism it doesn't lead to communism

1098.0 --> 1102.24
but

1099.28 --> 1103.52
it leaves certain open ends and if the

1102.24 --> 1107.52
government

1103.52 --> 1109.76
starts to go autocratic then they can

1107.52 --> 1112.16
very easily maneuver the whole thing

1109.76 --> 1115.44
into communism

1112.16 --> 1118.16
without it being so upfront transparent

1115.44 --> 1120.24
at first that's the issue with socialism

1118.16 --> 1122.96
but it doesn't automatically turn into

1120.24 --> 1124.88
communism it all depends on the people

1122.96 --> 1126.16
if they are liberty minded if they are

1124.88 --> 1127.44
constitutional

1126.16 --> 1129.8400000000001
they're not going to turn it into

1127.44 --> 1130.559
communism they're just going to be like

1129.84 --> 1133.52
yeah

1130.559 --> 1134.08
this is just a strategy you help out the

1133.52 --> 1135.12
poor

1134.08 --> 1137.039
because otherwise they're going to

1135.12 --> 1137.36
resort to crime or they're going to just

1137.039 --> 1139.36
be

1137.36 --> 1140.7199999999998
suffering in the open which will also be

1139.36 --> 1144.8799999999999
demoralizing

1140.72 --> 1144.88
see right

1148.84 --> 1155.4399999999998
what anyway that's just my

1153.679 --> 1158.88
point on that you know it's it's all

1155.44 --> 1160.64
been so over generalized by now

1158.88 --> 1165.8400000000001
hey good servant good to see you in here

1160.64 --> 1165.8400000000001
as well

1168.96 --> 1174.16
nathan oakley what's happened lots have

1176.84 --> 1181.4399999999998
happened

1179.52 --> 1182.559
right so yeah that was i don't know what

1181.44 --> 1185.919
you mean there the

1182.559 --> 1190.48
pie eater with

1185.919 --> 1194.88
two t's uh

1190.48 --> 1199.039
what's the link sheriff i don't know

1194.88 --> 1201.44
got some problem with your keyboard

1199.039 --> 1203.919
oh yeah it's a mobile right i'd have

1201.44 --> 1206.0800000000002
trouble with it too

1203.919 --> 1207.7
but i don't see any links shared in in

1206.08 --> 1210.809
skype that's fine

1207.7 --> 1210.809
[Music]

1211.44 --> 1219.76
the people have no say

1214.96 --> 1223.8400000000001
well that's technically that's right

1219.76 --> 1227.919
they have slightly less of a say

1223.84 --> 1230.559
but it's you know the thing about it is

1227.919 --> 1233.039
there should probably be like a midway

1230.559 --> 1235.44
socialism system

1233.039 --> 1237.039
like it's soft socialism that's what i'm

1235.44 --> 1239.52
thinking of like okay

1237.039 --> 1241.76
it's like a socialism based on on volunt

1239.52 --> 1243.44
on a voluntary system now of course in

1241.76 --> 1245.76
capitalism in the old days

1243.44 --> 1246.64
that would simply then like for example

1245.76 --> 1248.96
be the church

1246.64 --> 1250.24
like people donate to church church does

1248.96 --> 1253.919
fallen does help

1250.24 --> 1257.1200000000001
people they need like that but

1253.919 --> 1258.0
yeah socialism kind of took that over

1257.12 --> 1261.84
and then

1258.0 --> 1265.039
enforced it through taxes but

1261.84 --> 1267.12
there could be like a midway like make

1265.039 --> 1267.52
it in between so that people technically

1267.12 --> 1271.6
don't

1267.52 --> 1271.6
have to pay for it

1272.0 --> 1277.52
but that they then can't utilize

1275.039 --> 1279.12
things as well like that see so it can

1277.52 --> 1280.72
be purely constitutional

1279.12 --> 1282.4799999999998
you're not going to enforce things

1280.72 --> 1283.919
except for like absolute base

1282.48 --> 1286.559
requirements

1283.919 --> 1287.44
security i don't know it has to be

1286.559 --> 1289.12
worked out

1287.44 --> 1293.679
so there are different positions like

1289.12 --> 1296.1589999999999
you can be a fully contributing

1293.679 --> 1298.0800000000002
social assist yeah social social system

1296.159 --> 1300.64
contributor

1298.08 --> 1303.039
or you could be in out yeah a not a

1300.64 --> 1305.679
non-social contributing

1303.039 --> 1307.039
constitutionalist like that and both

1305.679 --> 1309.3600000000001
would have

1307.039 --> 1311.679
upsides and downsides now if that could

1309.36 --> 1313.6789999999999
be worked out very carefully

1311.679 --> 1316.3200000000002
you might actually have a pretty viable

1313.679 --> 1321.2800000000002
way of going around in these times

1316.32 --> 1321.28
you know just an idea

1321.36 --> 1325.6789999999999
it's not it's not easy to work out a

1323.679 --> 1328.0
good balance with it it will definitely

1325.679 --> 1330.96
depend on like

1328.0 --> 1332.0
the old and the new standard values of

1330.96 --> 1334.4
the region

1332.0 --> 1336.48
as it were so maybe it should be done

1334.4 --> 1341.039
like this in a more reasonable fashion

1336.48 --> 1344.799
i don't know it's an idea soft socialism

1341.039 --> 1344.799
with absolute option for just

1344.84 --> 1347.84
constitutionalism

1355.0 --> 1358.2
[Music]

1358.84 --> 1365.36
anyway

1361.679 --> 1368.5590000000002
right huh

1365.36 --> 1375.84
today's voting situation seems to be

1368.559 --> 1375.84
different not used to that

1382.4 --> 1385.679
socialism okay george sanford yeah yeah

1385.28 --> 1389.84
yeah

1385.679 --> 1389.8400000000001
yeah sure

1392.1 --> 1395.23
[Music]

1421.679 --> 1426.96
yeah you know what

1424.96 --> 1428.159
yeah i'm fine with you saying that in

1426.96 --> 1430.08
chat george stanford

1428.159 --> 1432.159
if you could actually explain to me

1430.08 --> 1434.799
exactly why

1432.159 --> 1437.2
and if you're going to reflect some

1434.799 --> 1439.52
obviously propagandized weaponized

1437.2 --> 1440.559
story about it that i recognize because

1439.52 --> 1445.2
i've heard it all

1440.559 --> 1459.52
and i believed it at some point

1445.2 --> 1461.919
then i'll just point that out to you

1459.52 --> 1464.799
[Music]

1461.919 --> 1464.7990000000002
yeah good servant

1467.76 --> 1473.84
i get it

1482.49 --> 1485.63
[Music]

1506.4 --> 1512.0
social mediaism that's a good one good

1512.84 --> 1515.84
servant

1518.559 --> 1522.48
yeah so anyway uh yeah that's just a

1521.2 --> 1526.159
very short point

1522.48 --> 1526.72
an idea you know i think so many people

1526.159 --> 1529.44
are just

1526.72 --> 1530.799
caught up in just this is the enemy we

1529.44 --> 1531.919
have to attack the enemy we have to

1530.799 --> 1534.6399999999999
convince

1531.919 --> 1536.72
everyone that this is the enemy and i

1534.64 --> 1538.0800000000002
just get the idea that a lot of people

1536.72 --> 1542.08
just

1538.08 --> 1544.8799999999999
overlook actually trying to figure out a

1542.08 --> 1546.24
way through figure out like hey how can

1544.88 --> 1550.4
we use these

1546.24 --> 1551.84
broken elements maybe yeah reconstruct

1550.4 --> 1552.4
something out of them that could

1551.84 --> 1555.6789999999999
actually

1552.4 --> 1557.919
help you know but yeah everybody's too

1555.679 --> 1559.1200000000001
preoccupied right now with that we have

1557.919 --> 1562.64
to

1559.12 --> 1562.6399999999999
we have to stop the enemy

1568.84 --> 1571.84
uh

1577.919 --> 1580.24
hmm

1582.159 --> 1586.88
right well hey look george sanford

1584.64 --> 1590.72
that's the thing you know

1586.88 --> 1593.279
if if a country is literally

1590.72 --> 1595.44
the government itself is just taking

1593.279 --> 1597.679
your tax money and then wasting it on

1595.44 --> 1599.76
ridiculous [ __ ]

1597.679 --> 1602.96
or something that's obviously against

1599.76 --> 1602.96
the interest of the people

1604.799 --> 1608.96
that they're not actually getting

1606.159 --> 1610.96
something back for that yeah of course

1608.96 --> 1612.72
but yeah that sort of [ __ ] happens in

1610.96 --> 1615.2
any system

1612.72 --> 1616.4
you know it people could also like that

1615.2 --> 1618.64
be scammed

1616.4 --> 1620.3200000000002
out of something to voluntarily give

1618.64 --> 1622.4
their money to the government

1620.32 --> 1624.32
and then the government actually used it

1622.4 --> 1628.48
it uses it for something else

1624.32 --> 1630.559
you know so it's not just socialism

1628.48 --> 1633.1200000000001
see the problem is the way the

1630.559 --> 1633.12
government

1633.279 --> 1638.96
goes around and does things if they act

1636.4 --> 1640.72
against the interest of their own people

1638.96 --> 1642.64
their own voters or whatever you're

1640.72 --> 1646.08
gonna see this yeah

1642.64 --> 1648.159
you got a problem doesn't really matter

1646.08 --> 1649.279
what type of government it really is

1648.159 --> 1651.0390000000002
even

1649.279 --> 1653.2
although yes certain governments will

1651.039 --> 1656.64
make it just impossible for you

1653.2 --> 1657.1200000000001
because of bureaucracy and bureaucracy

1656.64 --> 1659.1200000000001
laws

1657.12 --> 1660.6399999999999
to do anything about it and that's

1659.12 --> 1662.2399999999998
typically communism

1660.64 --> 1665.1200000000001
you know that's the sign of communism

1662.24 --> 1667.84
that the bureaucracy goes out of control

1665.12 --> 1668.6399999999999
eventually at first bureaucracy is there

1667.84 --> 1671.84
to

1668.64 --> 1674.3200000000002
give a standardized response system and

1671.84 --> 1676.8799999999999
then when it corrupts

1674.32 --> 1677.6789999999999
becomes communist then the bureaucracy

1676.88 --> 1680.64
becomes

1677.679 --> 1682.3990000000001
the slowdown for anyone to do anything

1680.64 --> 1684.0800000000002
about anything

1682.399 --> 1685.6789999999999
so yeah it's like oh you want to do

1684.08 --> 1688.96
something or you got

1685.679 --> 1692.0800000000002
wait five years in the row

1688.96 --> 1693.44
or fill out these thousand forms and if

1692.08 --> 1695.9189999999999
you make one mistake then

1693.44 --> 1697.52
at the thousandth form will tell you

1695.919 --> 1701.679
have to start all over again

1697.52 --> 1704.08
that sort of bureaucracy

1701.679 --> 1706.72
corruption is what really makes

1704.08 --> 1709.36
communism communism

1706.72 --> 1711.84
and as long as you don't have that yet

1709.36 --> 1711.84
yeah

1712.799 --> 1718.72
it's still doable and hey

1716.799 --> 1720.8799999999999
i'm pretty sure there's a lot of that in

1718.72 --> 1723.1200000000001
the united states actually

1720.88 --> 1724.3200000000002
right the non-communist countries

1723.12 --> 1727.6789999999999
supposedly

1724.32 --> 1727.6789999999999
so hmm

1751.279 --> 1756.399
income tax temporary wartime tax is it

1759.679 --> 1765.3600000000001
i what are you referring to exactly

1763.279 --> 1768.72
i don't know george sanford you're not

1765.36 --> 1768.7199999999998
from the united states right

1776.159 --> 1779.3600000000001
technically in the united states the

1778.88 --> 1782.48
income

1779.36 --> 1786.399
tax is supposedly is

1782.48 --> 1787.76
voluntary you're not legally obligated

1786.399 --> 1791.1999999999998
to actually pay it

1787.76 --> 1794.48
really but the problem is yeah the irs

1791.2 --> 1797.679
is basically

1794.48 --> 1797.679
an independent

1798.0 --> 1803.76
taxation organization that can

1801.52 --> 1804.6399999999999
that basically can act and the

1803.76 --> 1808.48
government every

1804.64 --> 1811.2
they have legal rights to do stuff then

1808.48 --> 1813.039
and they'll make your life miserable

1811.2 --> 1816.799
it's very weird how that works how they

1813.039 --> 1816.799
worked around it in the united states

1817.039 --> 1826.799
but it is technically an option

1823.36 --> 1830.1589999999999
to not pay income tax but yeah usually

1826.799 --> 1833.84
not without consequences

1830.159 --> 1836.0800000000002
oh in canada all right i don't know how

1833.84 --> 1839.1999999999998
the tax system works in canada at

1836.08 --> 1843.36
all just at all i just know that it's

1839.2 --> 1846.32
actually still kind of a a colony from

1843.36 --> 1846.32
from of the queen

1846.72 --> 1850.0
that's as far as my knowledge goes and

1848.72 --> 1853.2
that supposedly

1850.0 --> 1854.48
cannabis is legal there like really

1853.2 --> 1865.8400000000001
legal

1854.48 --> 1865.84
so i don't know much about canada

1867.12 --> 1870.32
[Music]

1876.84 --> 1879.84
hmm

1887.519 --> 1893.679
a good servant voluntary it's

1891.44 --> 1894.96
the income tax that's what i was talking

1893.679 --> 1897.679
about

1894.96 --> 1900.24
because the other taxations the it'll

1897.679 --> 1900.24
just happen

1900.96 --> 1907.8400000000001
i think it's more state-bound and they

1904.08 --> 1907.84
just do it

1914.0 --> 1918.559
not legal oh god really i thought it was

1916.72 --> 1920.0
really legal so it's just the same

1918.559 --> 1922.96
nonsense systems as

1920.0 --> 1922.96
in the netherlands then

1924.24 --> 1935.84
it's a condoning policy

1940.799 --> 1945.279
you could go to jail well that doesn't

1943.12 --> 1947.1999999999998
make any sense good servant

1945.279 --> 1948.88
if it is voluntary based then how can

1947.2 --> 1952.0800000000002
you go to jail

1948.88 --> 1954.48
for not paying income tax that makes no

1952.08 --> 1954.48
sense

1955.919 --> 1960.72
i although

1958.96 --> 1962.159
maybe you're referring to something else

1960.72 --> 1966.24
that if you file

1962.159 --> 1969.0390000000002
your tax forms incorrectly

1966.24 --> 1970.24
that then technically they can put you

1969.039 --> 1977.76
into jail over that

1970.24 --> 1981.2
if you mean that i've heard of that

1977.76 --> 1983.679
but if you just don't do it at all

1981.2 --> 1985.3600000000001
technically they shouldn't have any hold

1983.679 --> 1988.799
on you

1985.36 --> 1991.84
they can still harass you though

1988.799 --> 1994.08
or like through corporations just block

1991.84 --> 1996.24
any efforts you're making that kind of

1994.08 --> 1996.24
thing

2002.84 --> 2007.9189999999999
think

2005.519 --> 2007.919
anyway

2008.67 --> 2015.76
[Music]

2010.559 --> 2015.76
yeah it works differently different

2016.84 --> 2019.84
places

2020.559 --> 2033.84
all right

2037.6 --> 2047.84
right george sanford that makes sense

2049.28 --> 2056.159
it's just like registering to vote once

2052.48 --> 2056.159
you register to vote then

2056.96 --> 2060.639
yeah you're gonna basically play into a

2059.04 --> 2061.679
system where they do all kinds of

2060.639 --> 2065.839
trickery and

2061.679 --> 2069.599
just like make your straw man

2065.839 --> 2072.0789999999997
legal thing about you vote

2069.599 --> 2074.159
something like that it's i don't know

2072.079 --> 2077.44
exactly the details i heard some

2074.159 --> 2079.28
some conversation about it a few days

2077.44 --> 2080.32
ago i don't remember the details too

2079.28 --> 2082.079
much but it

2080.32 --> 2085.28
like if you register to vote in the

2082.079 --> 2088.96
united states then you basically consent

2085.28 --> 2092.159
to have voted

2088.96 --> 2095.599
and that there's even signs that

2092.159 --> 2096.879
they don't even look at the actual vote

2095.599 --> 2100.1600000000003
sometimes they just

2096.879 --> 2102.56
pick the registered votes

2100.16 --> 2103.7599999999998
and then do party politics with it

2102.56 --> 2106.0789999999997
something like that

2103.76 --> 2108.4
not too sure though don't don't pin me

2106.079 --> 2108.4
on that

2109.28 --> 2113.2000000000003
i don't understand how things were you

2110.96 --> 2114.7200000000003
know the electoral college is already

2113.2 --> 2117.9199999999996
kind of weird to me

2114.72 --> 2121.5989999999997
in the united states so yes

2117.92 --> 2124.88
very very complicated elaborate stuff

2121.599 --> 2124.88
the whole system i don't know

2125.28 --> 2130.079
yeah that's technically not what i

2129.04 --> 2132.16
wanted to talk about

2130.079 --> 2133.6800000000003
the entire show even though it is a

2132.16 --> 2135.7599999999998
subject

2133.68 --> 2137.5989999999997
to consider especially in the united

2135.76 --> 2139.28
states since

2137.599 --> 2144.96
not too long from now there's going to

2139.28 --> 2147.3590000000004
be a new presidential vote

2144.96 --> 2159.839
and yeah shit's gonna hit the fan one

2147.359 --> 2159.839
way or the other

2162.48 --> 2166.48
yeah that's right tiny one well yeah

2164.079 --> 2172.1600000000003
that correct the roads

2166.48 --> 2175.76
public building services

2172.16 --> 2178.72
right but the best way to do that

2175.76 --> 2181.5200000000004
would be to basically turn it more into

2178.72 --> 2184.72
a non-profit corporate system for it

2181.52 --> 2186.96
so yeah if you

2184.72 --> 2189.04
really want to exclude all taxes but

2186.96 --> 2191.599
still keep it running

2189.04 --> 2192.72
then those public buildings and services

2191.599 --> 2194.7200000000003
should simply have

2192.72 --> 2196.72
fees that you pay on the spot when you

2194.72 --> 2198.839
use them and that's much more like a

2196.72 --> 2202.7999999999997
corporation

2198.839 --> 2205.2799999999997
well back in the day when i discussed

2202.8 --> 2208.1600000000003
other forms of government more and i

2205.28 --> 2211.2000000000003
pointed at like a more libertarian

2208.16 --> 2214.64
soft socialism blend

2211.2 --> 2217.5989999999997
constitutional libertarian

2214.64 --> 2219.52
soft socialism type system then that

2217.599 --> 2220.48
makes sense because the government would

2219.52 --> 2223.44
basically be

2220.48 --> 2225.52
corporations that are assigned by the

2223.44 --> 2227.92
people

2225.52 --> 2228.72
and could be quickly fired by the people

2227.92 --> 2231.599
as well

2228.72 --> 2231.9199999999996
they step out of line and they would

2231.599 --> 2234.56
have

2231.92 --> 2236.2400000000002
absolutely right it's i guess much more

2234.56 --> 2239.359
closer to

2236.24 --> 2242.56
the old american form of government

2239.359 --> 2243.52
when yeah if you think about it the

2242.56 --> 2248.32
federal government

2243.52 --> 2253.359
is a united states corporation

2248.32 --> 2255.92
that's what it technically is so yeah my

2253.359 --> 2257.5989999999997
libertarian constitution lists soft

2255.92 --> 2260.2400000000002
socialist system

2257.599 --> 2262.7200000000003
hopefully internet voting would require

2260.24 --> 2265.9199999999996
technology to really make it work

2262.72 --> 2269.52
close communication and like more

2265.92 --> 2272.32
mandatory activity to basically

2269.52 --> 2273.92
yeah in a way if you don't keep track of

2272.32 --> 2276.079
it then everything goes to [ __ ]

2273.92 --> 2279.839
if nobody does anything in such a system

2276.079 --> 2279.8390000000004
it literally all goes to [ __ ]

2280.079 --> 2283.28
so that would have to be some kind of i

2282.48 --> 2286.8
don't know a

2283.28 --> 2288.1600000000003
civil service things you would have to

2286.8 --> 2290.5600000000004
do as a citizen

2288.16 --> 2292.24
to keep things going you would have to

2290.56 --> 2294.64
check

2292.24 --> 2296.3199999999997
go with votes that would probably happen

2294.64 --> 2298.56
a lot more

2296.32 --> 2299.44
and would have to also be made easier to

2298.56 --> 2301.599
do that but

2299.44 --> 2304.079
yeah it becomes very important then that

2301.599 --> 2308.88
the public actually is informed

2304.079 --> 2311.04
like naivety and just being delusional

2308.88 --> 2313.839
if that's the average it's not gonna

2311.04 --> 2313.839
work

2314.0 --> 2318.0
so yeah that's a bit of a problem in the

2316.24 --> 2320.7999999999997
current situation although yeah

2318.0 --> 2321.2
you don't know how long it takes for

2320.8 --> 2324.1600000000003
people

2321.2 --> 2326.16
actually snap out of all this delusion

2324.16 --> 2327.2799999999997
because it is collectively being fed

2326.16 --> 2329.1189999999997
into them

2327.28 --> 2330.8
and then they stay like that and then

2329.119 --> 2331.359
you eventually start to think like yeah

2330.8 --> 2333.44
that's

2331.359 --> 2334.4
what they are they're nothing more but

2333.44 --> 2336.88
if

2334.4 --> 2337.76
such a spell that keeps that going just

2336.88 --> 2340.56
snaps

2337.76 --> 2342.6400000000003
it goes away it absolutely crashes and

2340.56 --> 2345.2
it'll never come back like that

2342.64 --> 2346.0
from the same people and all that then

2345.2 --> 2347.839
some of those

2346.0 --> 2351.76
people that were in that delusion may

2347.839 --> 2351.7599999999998
actually snap out of it and just like oh

2352.839 --> 2357.92
[ __ ] yeah

2355.599 --> 2359.28
i'm gonna have to try to do my best

2357.92 --> 2369.839
again

2359.28 --> 2369.8390000000004
so yeah you never really know

2380.839 --> 2383.839
uh

2385.839 --> 2397.839
state pension ridiculous

2402.16 --> 2405.7599999999998
what are your questions about tiny

2403.68 --> 2406.24
wumble hey you're naming all these

2405.76 --> 2408.8390000000004
things

2406.24 --> 2410.16
like that's all super important or

2408.839 --> 2413.68
anything

2410.16 --> 2416.8799999999997
most of it is just bureaucratic waste

2413.68 --> 2418.0
and yeah money scam opportunities for

2416.88 --> 2421.6800000000003
elitists to just

2418.0 --> 2421.68
shove around a lot of state money

2422.839 --> 2425.839
so

2433.52 --> 2438.56
in reality in reality there's very

2436.96 --> 2441.92
little things

2438.56 --> 2444.72
that the public actually really needs

2441.92 --> 2445.6800000000003
from the government they just get used

2444.72 --> 2448.48
to it

2445.68 --> 2450.64
they get lazy you start to like oh yeah

2448.48 --> 2453.04
of course the government does that

2450.64 --> 2455.839
because they don't even think about

2453.04 --> 2459.599
whether that's a good idea or not

2455.839 --> 2459.599
just yeah

2464.72 --> 2469.359
yeah well tiny wumbo you have no proof

2467.119 --> 2470.319
whatsoever that that's actually the case

2469.359 --> 2473.839
though

2470.319 --> 2477.52
you don't even know how the money routes

2473.839 --> 2479.839
once they're injected like into the

2477.52 --> 2482.0
into the money storage for detection you

2479.839 --> 2484.56
don't even know how that all ties in

2482.0 --> 2487.44
you know like what is said how it works

2484.56 --> 2495.839
does it actually work like that

2487.44 --> 2495.839
often it doesn't

2497.04 --> 2509.839
ah hello enlightened on welcome to chat

2515.76 --> 2519.599
yeah yeah gideon's sick i totally agree

2518.16 --> 2523.04
with that

2519.599 --> 2526.96
like tax write-offs

2523.04 --> 2531.92
is is just a terrible system

2526.96 --> 2536.7200000000003
should never work like that because

2531.92 --> 2538.56
yeah it's just gonna

2536.72 --> 2541.52
make it more difficult for the little

2538.56 --> 2544.0
businesses that often don't have this

2541.52 --> 2545.52
unless a tax write-offs are specifically

2544.0 --> 2547.119
for that

2545.52 --> 2549.04
then it becomes different but at the

2547.119 --> 2552.2400000000002
same time it also becomes

2549.04 --> 2555.599
more prone to actual scamming

2552.24 --> 2557.4399999999996
it's it's problematic so as far as i'm

2555.599 --> 2560.0
concerned tax write-offs should just be

2557.44 --> 2561.119
completely swept off the table

2560.0 --> 2565.52
everywhere

2561.119 --> 2568.88
and just make it direct no more trickery

2565.52 --> 2568.88
because it is kind of trickery

2569.13 --> 2572.239
[Music]

2575.839 --> 2581.44
like either you pay the tax or or there

2578.64 --> 2581.44
is no tax

2590.16 --> 2597.2799999999997
ha well it's good that that's not

2593.92 --> 2600.319
entirely up to you the random explorer

2597.28 --> 2604.079
because yeah those things that's

2600.319 --> 2604.079
that's all about priorities you know

2604.8 --> 2611.599
in this world it's become very tough to

2607.44 --> 2611.599
financially manage having children

2611.76 --> 2616.88
in a in a high taxation society that's

2614.48 --> 2620.2400000000002
extremely difficult

2616.88 --> 2623.119
so yeah if

2620.24 --> 2624.0
if if not if that wouldn't happen at all

2623.119 --> 2626.88
then

2624.0 --> 2627.599
seriously people wouldn't get children

2626.88 --> 2630.8
anymore

2627.599 --> 2632.6400000000003
a lot less would do it

2630.8 --> 2634.4
because everybody would get the feeling

2632.64 --> 2636.96
you would have to win the lottery

2634.4 --> 2636.96
to get it

2640.33 --> 2643.52
[Music]

2644.64 --> 2648.0789999999997
it's not your problem well good for you

2647.359 --> 2650.7999999999997
that it's not

2648.079 --> 2650.8
your problem

2651.28 --> 2657.28
let's see what's left when you're old

2654.96 --> 2659.92
how many people are still left out there

2657.28 --> 2663.599
doing work

2659.92 --> 2677.839
right or you're too old to do anything

2663.599 --> 2677.839
let's see how you feel about it then

2691.839 --> 2695.04
all right yeah well hey random explorer

2694.24 --> 2698.24
just

2695.04 --> 2702.24
don't forget that others people children

2698.24 --> 2705.68
right like after

2702.24 --> 2706.56
15 20 years those children are actually

2705.68 --> 2710.3999999999996
adults

2706.56 --> 2714.24
and they're gonna be doing the labor

2710.4 --> 2717.599
in society yeah they're gonna be the new

2714.24 --> 2717.5989999999997
doctors the nurses

2717.68 --> 2721.44
people working in stores in warehouses

2721.04 --> 2724.72
so

2721.44 --> 2727.76
hey if you don't like that

2724.72 --> 2730.7999999999997
yeah again just

2727.76 --> 2732.079
see what happens when you're old and

2730.8 --> 2734.5600000000004
there's literally nobody

2732.079 --> 2747.8390000000004
out there left doing anything see how

2734.56 --> 2747.839
you feel about it then

2749.28 --> 2753.2000000000003
yeah well look if you want fewer people

2752.0 --> 2757.599
on the planet

2753.2 --> 2761.52
right planet yeah maybe you should just

2757.599 --> 2763.119
not live in highly compacted cities

2761.52 --> 2765.599
because yeah that gives you a lot of

2763.119 --> 2768.0
feeling like it's overpopulated

2765.599 --> 2770.1600000000003
it's not though it's just that if

2768.0 --> 2772.079
everybody gets all stashed together yeah

2770.16 --> 2774.56
you get the feeling oh [ __ ] the entire

2772.079 --> 2777.28
world is filled with people everywhere

2774.56 --> 2779.839
it's nonsense it's not true because

2777.28 --> 2782.88
you're sitting

2779.839 --> 2783.68
in an overcrowded yeah cage filled with

2782.88 --> 2786.8
people

2783.68 --> 2788.48
basically you know if you if that's

2786.8 --> 2789.44
really your sensation then maybe you

2788.48 --> 2793.04
should consider

2789.44 --> 2793.44
like getting out of the city and going

2793.04 --> 2796.4
to

2793.44 --> 2803.839
more rural rural areas where there's a

2796.4 --> 2803.839
lot less people

2810.8 --> 2813.3590000000004
okay

2815.2 --> 2818.64
oh what are you complaining about then

2826.4 --> 2833.6800000000003
i need to hurry oh crap oh

2830.88 --> 2833.6800000000003
yeah sure

2840.48 --> 2844.16
all right well if you keep up that

2842.559 --> 2845.92
attitude then eventually

2844.16 --> 2848.16
the rest of the people will feel the

2845.92 --> 2851.28
same thing about you

2848.16 --> 2853.7599999999998
so yeah you know if you think that you

2851.28 --> 2856.8390000000004
never need anyone ever

2853.76 --> 2859.44
then hey you'll be tested on that

2856.839 --> 2862.88
eventually

2859.44 --> 2863.44
and see how you like it when you need

2862.88 --> 2865.119
some help

2863.44 --> 2867.76
all of a sudden even though you're used

2865.119 --> 2869.2000000000003
to always be able to handle it and then

2867.76 --> 2873.8390000000004
at some point you won't be and then

2869.2 --> 2873.839
let's see how you feel about it then

2895.44 --> 2904.079
all right yeah random explorer i'm sure

2900.4 --> 2904.079
so keep telling yourself that

2904.4 --> 2911.52
and yeah let's see how that works out in

2908.4 --> 2911.52
say 60 years

2913.52 --> 2920.24
see see how well that goes then

2917.52 --> 2920.64
or maybe maybe you are like like that

2920.24 --> 2924.16
maybe

2920.64 --> 2928.0789999999997
are much more of a hermit than me

2924.16 --> 2931.44
and then that's fine but yeah

2928.079 --> 2934.88
let's just say that's a personal issue

2931.44 --> 2937.599
and those people's opinions about

2934.88 --> 2938.1600000000003
other people out there usually don't

2937.599 --> 2941.839
matter

2938.16 --> 2943.52
at all i have my own issues with that

2941.839 --> 2944.5589999999997
and i never throw out these kinds of

2943.52 --> 2948.24
opinions because

2944.559 --> 2948.2400000000002
it is just stupid

2948.319 --> 2954.5589999999997
and wrong it's short-sighted

2951.359 --> 2954.5589999999997
it's egotistical

2955.2 --> 2959.5989999999997
comes from the inability to just deal

2957.359 --> 2961.52
with people

2959.599 --> 2963.28
right there's plenty people out there

2961.52 --> 2971.839
that don't have that problem

2963.28 --> 2971.8390000000004
so they don't take on those opinions

2979.29 --> 2984.72
[Music]

2981.44 --> 2985.44
so yeah don't mind if we just completely

2984.72 --> 2990.9599999999996
ignore

2985.44 --> 2990.96
that because it's not helping anything

2996.839 --> 2999.839
uh

3001.68 --> 3006.319
taxation through democracy that's not

3004.079 --> 3006.319
real

3008.4 --> 3011.52
nobody can just do that that's called

3011.2 --> 3015.04
that

3011.52 --> 3015.04
is just called a robbery

3022.48 --> 3030.88
right well random explorer so have i

3027.04 --> 3031.52
but i'm not i'm going to actually look

3030.88 --> 3035.04
beyond

3031.52 --> 3038.0
my own personal social

3035.04 --> 3038.5589999999997
feelings towards things out there and

3038.0 --> 3042.0
all that

3038.559 --> 3042.88
i'm just gonna ascend above it not get

3042.0 --> 3044.88
stuck on this

3042.88 --> 3046.8
hermit social position because it's

3044.88 --> 3049.52
completely useless

3046.8 --> 3050.319
for everyone including yourself to focus

3049.52 --> 3052.96
on that

3050.319 --> 3055.44
to let your opinions be sueded by those

3052.96 --> 3057.92
types of feelings

3055.44 --> 3058.64
it's not true none of it is true in

3057.92 --> 3063.04
reality

3058.64 --> 3069.839
in practicality statistically

3063.04 --> 3069.839
historically so

3074.0 --> 3077.44
but i get it you know

3079.68 --> 3083.7599999999998
i'm look me my me personally i'm not

3082.72 --> 3085.7599999999998
much of a fan

3083.76 --> 3089.44
of the majority of people out there at

3085.76 --> 3092.88
times you know i get really like

3089.44 --> 3094.96
and yeah i've expressed that but yeah

3092.88 --> 3097.76
then in other times i'm not so much like

3094.96 --> 3101.359
that and actually like [ __ ] i really

3097.76 --> 3103.6800000000003
i really need to hang around with people

3101.359 --> 3105.44
face to face more because it's more

3103.68 --> 3107.9199999999996
healthy for me actually

3105.44 --> 3108.96
i've missed it you know doing this show

3107.92 --> 3113.44
every day yeah

3108.96 --> 3115.44
it's good but it's mostly just my spirit

3113.44 --> 3118.64
that's doing that there's no physical

3115.44 --> 3118.64
interaction going on

3118.88 --> 3122.559
and well now that i have a roommate that

3122.079 --> 3125.599
kind of

3122.559 --> 3126.6400000000003
yeah i can really go go get along with

3125.599 --> 3128.559
her

3126.64 --> 3130.48
and now i'm hanging around with them and

3128.559 --> 3133.599
new friends they basically

3130.48 --> 3137.839
bring in meet new girls it's

3133.599 --> 3141.3590000000004
kind of nice and i just noticed the huge

3137.839 --> 3145.44
difference for my overall energy

3141.359 --> 3145.44
like that matters it matters

3146.64 --> 3152.0
even though like i i'm not like yeah i

3149.44 --> 3156.4
wanna hang around with these people 24

3152.0 --> 3159.599
7. no no no no

3156.4 --> 3160.64
but it's really important that i do hang

3159.599 --> 3163.6800000000003
around with them

3160.64 --> 3166.48
at least a little every now and then

3163.68 --> 3167.359
because otherwise i'm gonna grow all

3166.48 --> 3169.92
like

3167.359 --> 3169.92
anxious

3171.76 --> 3177.2000000000003
become more prone to panic type

3174.8 --> 3180.88
sensations it's weird

3177.2 --> 3181.839
so yeah you need people even a hermit

3180.88 --> 3195.839
needs people

3181.839 --> 3195.839
every now and then

3206.0 --> 3213.839
immigration is fine huh

3209.44 --> 3213.839
uh well

3214.24 --> 3221.9199999999996
in general migration and

3218.64 --> 3222.7999999999997
all that yeah sure that is fine it has

3221.92 --> 3225.76
it has

3222.8 --> 3226.7200000000003
functions but yeah the way things

3225.76 --> 3231.8390000000004
working now

3226.72 --> 3234.7999999999997
immigration has been weaponized so

3231.839 --> 3236.48
you know immigration can be weaponized

3234.8 --> 3239.28
by simply groups

3236.48 --> 3240.96
going out there gathering up a very

3239.28 --> 3244.1600000000003
specific type of people

3240.96 --> 3247.44
with specific type of mindsets

3244.16 --> 3249.7599999999998
conditioning them extra

3247.44 --> 3251.599
in towards a certain direction towards a

3249.76 --> 3252.079
certain attitude and then bringing in

3251.599 --> 3254.6400000000003
those

3252.079 --> 3256.88
groups of people yeah that's not good

3254.64 --> 3257.5989999999997
immigration that's actually weaponized

3256.88 --> 3260.96
immigration

3257.599 --> 3263.2000000000003
and that's really going on

3260.96 --> 3265.28
all right that's going on in the world

3263.2 --> 3268.48
it's not just the united states also

3265.28 --> 3268.88
europe and that doesn't mean that

3268.48 --> 3272.4
they're

3268.88 --> 3275.04
all going to be like that but they are

3272.4 --> 3275.76
in there and when immigration policy is

3275.04 --> 3278.24
good and

3275.76 --> 3279.3590000000004
people in government actually care about

3278.24 --> 3281.2
the public they

3279.359 --> 3283.2799999999997
they never do that they don't allow it

3281.2 --> 3285.4399999999996
they arrest people that do that and

3283.28 --> 3290.079
organize that they arrest them

3285.44 --> 3294.319
and they should be arrested you know

3290.079 --> 3294.7200000000003
but yeah because you don't want a group

3294.319 --> 3299.44
of

3294.72 --> 3301.9199999999996
arrogant hostile men at a certain age

3299.44 --> 3303.68
that are organized even among themselves

3301.92 --> 3306.7200000000003
obviously have plans

3303.68 --> 3307.04
to not uphold the law to not adapt to

3306.72 --> 3308.9599999999996
the

3307.04 --> 3312.24
to the culture of the of the country

3308.96 --> 3312.2400000000002
they're going to yet

3313.599 --> 3319.04
a good government a good immigration

3316.48 --> 3323.04
policy does not allow that they

3319.04 --> 3326.4
they thankfully they happily decline

3323.04 --> 3329.2799999999997
they're like nah you just go

3326.4 --> 3330.319
try your coup over there back in your

3329.28 --> 3334.6400000000003
own country

3330.319 --> 3336.88
if you're so eager to to conquer people

3334.64 --> 3336.8799999999997
right

3338.16 --> 3345.359
so yeah immigration it's not all bad

3341.44 --> 3347.68
but when it's weaponized like this

3345.359 --> 3349.44
by the interest of a specific few that

3347.68 --> 3350.8799999999997
don't have the interest of a country in

3349.44 --> 3363.839
mind yeah then it becomes

3350.88 --> 3363.839
bad news

3372.49 --> 3377.839
[Music]

3374.839 --> 3377.839
hmm

3387.44 --> 3392.4
wait until you find out how much they

3389.359 --> 3392.4
spend on wordproof

3393.35 --> 3396.449
[Music]

3415.76 --> 3419.8390000000004
uh george sanford that's kind of

3420.24 --> 3424.72
no immigrants i don't think so you can

3423.44 --> 3428.64
definitely

3424.72 --> 3430.0789999999997
become a russian citizen japan

3428.64 --> 3432.16
may be a little bit more difficult

3430.079 --> 3435.44
though but yes you will

3432.16 --> 3436.799
it's not just like oh sure anyone can

3435.44 --> 3440.96
come you will have to

3436.799 --> 3443.2
prove that you are capable of

3440.96 --> 3446.079
taking care of your own financial

3443.2 --> 3447.9199999999996
situation and that you have skills that

3446.079 --> 3449.52
could contribute to society yeah they

3447.92 --> 3452.64
have a much higher standard of

3449.52 --> 3455.68
immigration policy there and it's

3452.64 --> 3455.68
actually admirable

3456.48 --> 3461.839
but there is immigration to russia

3480.88 --> 3486.7200000000003
all right getting sick see you later i'm

3483.359 --> 3486.72
gonna round out the show anyway
