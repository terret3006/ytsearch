yeah I used it goodbye

68.39 --> 77.63
ah right today the weather is beautiful

73.759 --> 82.25
and hot I was actually thinking of

77.63 --> 83.0
putting on a white shirt but I'll

82.25 --> 85.39
explain later

83.0 --> 89.36
anyway yeah the weather is beautiful

85.39 --> 93.53
it's not cloudy at all like zero but

89.36 --> 96.17
yeah there are some chemtrails come

93.53 --> 98.63
trail cloud formation whatever you want

96.17 --> 100.399
to call it there are some lines in the

98.63 --> 103.81899999999999
sky and they keep hanging around and

100.399 --> 109.94
yeah there's that but despite that it's

103.819 --> 112.63
very beautiful it's not so windy it

109.94 --> 119.45
really feels like a midsummer it's great

112.63 --> 121.28
outside so but yeah I got tumeric coffee

119.45 --> 124.069
with me and that's why I thought maybe I

121.28 --> 126.52
shouldn't put on that white shirt if you

124.069 --> 126.52
know what I mean

135.8 --> 144.11
ah all right so let's see who is in chat

139.63 --> 145.64
yeah black is normal for me I dude I did

144.11 --> 147.83
like we're wearing the white t-shirt

145.64 --> 149.51
though I did only wear it during the

147.83 --> 154.94000000000003
show because I'm not gonna wear a white

149.51 --> 157.54999999999998
shirt when doing my paper rounds which

154.94 --> 161.99
was yesterday because then yeah the ink

157.55 --> 164.12
risks rubbing off on the white shirt you

161.99 --> 165.8
know white shirt is much tougher to keep

164.12 --> 173.39000000000001
white than a black shirt is to keep

165.8 --> 176.54000000000002
black anyway so let's go through chat

173.39 --> 180.35
Jim Jones was first Tom Parker dinosaur

sure like what yesterday showed the show

213.68 --> 218.75
from like the premiere on the flat earth

216.77 --> 221.03
debates was that the one that was play

218.75 --> 223.04
later was that the one from today or was

221.03 --> 225.38
that the one from yesterday because it's

223.04 --> 228.44
kind of confusing similar paper cake

225.38 --> 232.37
came on I don't remember you know in

228.44 --> 234.17
many ways it was very similar but no it

232.37 --> 237.1
had to be from the day before because I

234.17 --> 239.82999999999998
we did the thing I did the thing

237.1 --> 242.82999999999998
dragging that guy into my space-time

239.83 --> 242.83
conceptualization

243.02 --> 248.489
right yeah that was a really good show

245.7 --> 250.819
that specific one it was really good

248.489 --> 255.629
like everyone was completely on target

250.819 --> 258.47999999999996
no talking past one another and all that

255.629 --> 262.5
was a really good show yes they was also

258.48 --> 265.38
decent but I wasn't like there with my

262.5 --> 275.82
intention all the time it took me some

265.38 --> 279.169
time to get into it yeah which show was

275.82 --> 279.169
that by the way

286.94 --> 295.31
yeah it was eleven hundred and fifty

290.81 --> 297.83
nine and uncut an after-show that's the

295.31 --> 301.87
one it's a really good show and what I'm

297.83 --> 301.87
gonna link it up just for the record I

305.86 --> 310.57
thought that one was a really good show

318.27 --> 322.82
so let's see what you guys are talking

320.73 --> 322.82
about

328.389 --> 337.21000000000004
right now full moon yeah it was very

333.58 --> 339.909
close to fool last night didn't seem

337.21 --> 343.35999999999996
completely full yet so it'll probably be

339.909 --> 345.219
full over here as well of course it's

343.36 --> 347.66900000000004
ready for anywhere it's gonna be for

345.219 --> 347.669
everywhere

360.12 --> 365.76
yeah with these clear skies the full

362.37 --> 371.07
moon is really kind of astounding Nathan

365.76 --> 373.979
also mentioned yesterday and to me like

371.07 --> 377.4
when it's really a bright bright full

373.979 --> 381.27
moon or something versus a very clear

377.4 --> 384.44899999999996
black sky then it really almost does

381.27 --> 387.08
seem like a certain type of I don't know

384.449 --> 391.139
Street Lantern that type of light the

387.08 --> 393.27
the colder blue light like some street

391.139 --> 397.47
lanterns have that I don't know if it's

393.27 --> 402.65
common or maybe

397.47 --> 406.22900000000004
yeah the type of halogen bluish car

402.65 --> 412.82
front lights it's kind of like that

406.229 --> 415.62
almost mmm of Venus is up there as well

412.82 --> 417.99
no doubt when there's clear skies

415.62 --> 419.789
there's their Phoenix is usually hanging

417.99 --> 422.18
around somewhere especially in the early

419.789 --> 422.18
morning

432.34 --> 435.03
Hey

436.53 --> 441.05999999999995

461.86 --> 468.34000000000003
oh yeah and good servant link me up to I

464.77 --> 473.59
don't know how old it is a video clip

468.34 --> 476.84999999999997
from Family Guy it was posted to 27th

473.59 --> 479.14
but this could be much older of

476.85 --> 483.97
fly-on-the-wall des fly-on-the-wall

479.14 --> 484.51
scene and yeah that scene is freakin

483.97 --> 490.93
amazing

484.51 --> 491.5
it's like a conspiracy fly it was recent

490.93 --> 496.62
Wow

491.5 --> 496.62
well then it's really extra special and

496.8 --> 507.36
what's the name of the yes season 18

500.77 --> 507.35999999999996
episode 17 from the coma guy right

507.54 --> 511.71000000000004
what's the creator's name again

519.919 --> 533.98
I got the face in front of me but I

527.749 --> 533.98
don't know I could look it up

536.259 --> 542.119
anyway the fly in the wall scene I'll

538.699 --> 544.069
share it I shouldn't show it because

542.119 --> 546.589
because I'll probably get a strike for

544.069 --> 549.9989999999999
it Seth Rogen right yes

546.589 --> 555.47
Seth Rogen yeah he is an art fellow and

549.999 --> 559.9390000000001
he's definitely a Jew but and like

555.47 --> 564.7900000000001
liberal and but he has like a rebellious

559.939 --> 568.309
nature to him and yeah he's doing some

564.79 --> 571.449
interesting stuff sometimes and he is

568.309 --> 577.759
like like a sophisticated conspiracy

571.449 --> 584.059
thinker himself you know so yeah I don't

577.759 --> 586.5790000000001
know over the years it's yeah I've just

584.059 --> 589.73
found him in his work more interesting

586.579 --> 593.179
over time and he's always assess

589.73 --> 597.339
mcFarland that's the right Seth what did

593.179 --> 597.3389999999999
I say self Rogen who's that

600.83 --> 607.5500000000001
I have no idea who that is

604.82 --> 625.73
George Sanford but yeah I'd was Seth

607.55 --> 630.29
MacFarland and he mix it up okay Jim

625.73 --> 633.4590000000001
Jones I know Jon Rappoport odd not

630.29 --> 633.459
personally but I know who he is

634.48 --> 640.07
it was interesting like he's been very

638.149 --> 642.8
outspoken against Trump in certain

640.07 --> 646.37
occasions and Alex Jones Alex really

642.8 --> 650.12
took that yeah it's like he's a crazy

646.37 --> 652.49
liberal now but at the same time David

650.12 --> 655.07
Knight I think if I remember correctly

652.49 --> 658.91
had him on the show on the Alex Jones

655.07 --> 662.899
Show basically on the on the on the

658.91 --> 667.0699999999999
entire channel on his show - about

662.899 --> 671.3
certain other things it was for yeah so

667.07 --> 673.88
I do know that he's still around doing

671.3 --> 681.4699999999999
things I don't really follow him there's

673.88 --> 682.76
so many people out there it's alright

681.47 --> 685.4300000000001
but he's been around for a long time

682.76 --> 688.8199999999999
like I still remember him even from

685.43 --> 694.0889999999999
during 9/11 he was on top of that big

688.82 --> 694.089
time was it very forward 9/11 truther

695.88 --> 698.98
[Music]

702.23 --> 716.83
all right anyway what was that doing

707.51 --> 721.88
yesterday all right I did

716.83 --> 725.47
yeah I did catch on Benjamin again live

721.88 --> 728.36
and I figured out a very handy trick I

725.47 --> 731.24
because sometimes when I get on there D

728.36 --> 735.47
life it gets really slow down and it and

731.24 --> 739.04
it keeps on rate yeah like including a

735.47 --> 741.83
sound it just breaks down into like

739.04 --> 746.39
waiting row for loading you know the

741.83 --> 748.25
typical simile little spinny circle but

746.39 --> 751.4
then I figured out that you can reset

748.25 --> 754.4
the videos in D life as well and when

751.4 --> 757.16
you say source you get a pretty raw

754.4 --> 760.1
source that well at least with the sound

757.16 --> 762.89
just never interrupted once with me that

760.1 --> 765.47
was very nice but you have to reset it

762.89 --> 768.71
to that every time you refresh the page

765.47 --> 774.32
because it doesn't start that with with

768.71 --> 777.77
that mode on default so that was handy

774.32 --> 783.8900000000001
to figure that one uh and had some good

777.77 --> 786.68
interactions it jet have I ever read

783.89 --> 790.18
Enoch no good servant I have never read

786.68 --> 794.2299999999999
The Book of Enoch never had touched it

790.18 --> 797.0
paper wise I think I have a PDF of it I

794.23 --> 799.34
have like glanced through it and I have

797.0 --> 806.87
followed it right back in the earlier

799.34 --> 810.25
days a lot through its his name again

806.87 --> 812.89
flat water thanked guy

810.25 --> 816.14
because he makes a lot of videos with

812.89 --> 818.18
like yeah amazing pictures and stuff and

816.14 --> 820.9399999999999
some background music and then he just

818.18 --> 824.4799999999999
reads from from the Bible from Book of

820.94 --> 826.69
Enoch so I picked up on a lot through

824.48 --> 826.69
that

827.95 --> 831.0590000000001
[Music]

840.85 --> 849.61
pusher of Enoch well what about it are

844.57 --> 853.62
you gonna push you know I think that the

849.61 --> 859.27
Book of Enoch is a very relevant book

853.62 --> 861.93
but you know in a sense I do also agree

859.27 --> 869.37
for example with Bible literalist

861.93 --> 872.14
that it's not really about Jesus like no

869.37 --> 877.26
but it is it has very relevant

872.14 --> 884.14
information and it is extremely

877.26 --> 887.4399999999999
fascinating and yeah so I would never

884.14 --> 892.39
just say no no now it's off the devil

887.44 --> 894.7600000000001
it's you should ignore that no no but

892.39 --> 898.27
when it comes to we had the little Bible

894.76 --> 901.0
literalism approach and getting all

898.27 --> 903.37
historical and all that then it becomes

901.0 --> 907.51
a little bit more difficult to lean on

903.37 --> 910.15
that for the determination of like the

907.51 --> 916.26
overcoat or whatever you're gonna regard

910.15 --> 916.26
it as to what things mean exoteric Lee

918.15 --> 923.67
Enoch it office okay Cleary

928.579 --> 936.66
but now I've never read it okay I

934.56 --> 940.29
technically haven't even read through

936.66 --> 942.18
the Bible yet but but yeah the stories

940.29 --> 945.269
you know I've drowned in that and I have

942.18 --> 946.8889999999999
you know watch a video about it that

945.269 --> 951.509
just tells the story you get the

946.889 --> 954.9300000000001
information so I think I all know have

951.509 --> 959.069
received the entire story through people

954.93 --> 961.649
and through videos it's just not that

959.069 --> 965.25
I've literally consciously read it from

961.649 --> 967.699
the paper book in some kind of linear

965.25 --> 967.699
fashion

970.699 --> 978.29
Brian Avery's channel I don't know that

976.11 --> 978.29
is

983.78 --> 988.16
Brian Harvey I mean what

997.51 --> 1012.36
in UK boyband East 17 okay and never

1002.76 --> 1016.68
heard of it to be fair I think that's

1012.36 --> 1018.9590000000001
like completely British that never

1016.68 --> 1021.649
reached here or not that I picked up on

1018.959 --> 1024.36
you know the Netherlands tries to be all

1021.649 --> 1027.299
international and [ __ ] but on the scene

1024.36 --> 1030.54
that that happens the atmosphere I find

1027.299 --> 1034.4
there is so repulsive that I never tune

1030.54 --> 1034.3999999999999
into any of that like ever

1039.04 --> 1046.3899999999999
last time I turn tuned into TV to kind

1042.28 --> 1049.3
of like follow the mainstream scene or

1046.39 --> 1051.49
culture scene in which music is involved

1049.3 --> 1053.5
this was like a long time ago although I

1051.49 --> 1056.53
will turn on some kind of classical

1053.5 --> 1059.04
concert maybe if I just happen to bump

1056.53 --> 1059.04
into it

1070.35 --> 1076.59
well good servants the Bible is way

1073.259 --> 1078.3890000000001
better than a video it all depends you

1076.59 --> 1080.789
know when you read the Bible of course

1078.389 --> 1082.5
all the visuals are going to be purely

1080.789 --> 1089.85
in your mind

1082.5 --> 1091.95
so yeah the deeper design of the Bible

1089.85 --> 1095.009
the most dimensional effects on the

1091.95 --> 1097.289
spirit as well and they will potentially

1095.009 --> 1100.019
assist you to reveal all kinds of things

1097.289 --> 1102.72
even visual on the spot almost like a

1100.019 --> 1104.309
code translation that is possible when

1102.72 --> 1106.2
you read it and when you watch a video

1104.309 --> 1108.899
where everything specifically is

1106.2 --> 1113.69
depicted in some way that kind of

1108.899 --> 1116.309
tempers with the natural visualization

1113.69 --> 1121.98
potential that the Bible has that is

1116.309 --> 1126.6789999999999
true good servant but yeah when I

1121.98 --> 1126.679
I can bypass that personally

1128.02 --> 1131.119
[Music]

1135.03 --> 1138.17
[Music]

1154.48 --> 1159.52
well I was so late last night I don't

1157.66 --> 1162.67
even know how it got to that point

1159.52 --> 1165.51
all right I remember a little it was all

1162.67 --> 1169.3200000000002
so yeah Patricia steer was live again I

1165.51 --> 1169.32
was nice hanging around

1190.96 --> 1198.82
so yeah guys uh you know I I don't

1196.02 --> 1204.4
really have anything specific on mine

1198.82 --> 1208.6899999999998
that I wanted to talk about if I want to

1204.4 --> 1213.1200000000001
do I should have made notes but I'm just

1208.69 --> 1216.8200000000002
too damn stubborn for my own good

1213.12 --> 1220.9299999999998
but I am kind of open for guests in a

1216.82 --> 1223.48
way so if anybody wants to call wait

1220.93 --> 1227.3200000000002
maybe I can because I didn't talk about

1223.48 --> 1227.8600000000001
it yesterday d the supposed to New York

1227.32 --> 1233.5
City

1227.86 --> 1236.1399999999999
nurse video I did watch it I think it

1233.5 --> 1237.94
was a Missouri bear that asked me to

1236.14 --> 1242.5300000000002
watch it and I did watch it

1237.94 --> 1246.63
almost the entire thing and if Missouri

1242.53 --> 1250.66
bears here I could give some feedback

1246.63 --> 1257.64
play the Fe D video then are you sure at

1250.66 --> 1261.69
the makin you mean the the the fat HQ

1257.64 --> 1261.69
that epic video you made

1272.15 --> 1278.26
right while Tom Parker about that video

1275.08 --> 1281.26
it was very difficult for me to

1278.26 --> 1287.0
determine because there were absolutely

1281.26 --> 1288.86
it was a true testimony but well she was

1287.0 --> 1291.29
basically already admitting that she's

1288.86 --> 1293.03
just getting dragged into this thing

1291.29 --> 1295.58
that's like out of her control that is

1293.03 --> 1300.17
driving her mad so I think that that

1295.58 --> 1303.08
aspect may she was fully kind of well

1300.17 --> 1305.63
she was open about that that was the

1303.08 --> 1310.82
case basically she felt kind of stuck in

1305.63 --> 1313.3700000000001
a crazy situation so that could explain

1310.82 --> 1315.32
some of the warning signals that I did

1313.37 --> 1317.1799999999998
feel but that could have simply been

1315.32 --> 1322.3999999999999
things that were like on her mind that

1317.18 --> 1326.3600000000001
she just couldn't share cuz just - yes

1322.4 --> 1328.0400000000002
too much or something you know did and

1326.36 --> 1332.6499999999999
that sounds crazy because I thought she

1328.04 --> 1336.23
would emphasize pretty gruesome things

1332.65 --> 1338.24
results right but that doesn't mean that

1336.23 --> 1341.72
that's the end of it that's the creepy

1338.24 --> 1346.91
thing I know how crazy these types of

1341.72 --> 1350.48
things can get like if it is effectively

1346.91 --> 1353.27
unchecked if like the set up of the

1350.48 --> 1356.81
entire thing is just like that and

1353.27 --> 1360.05
nothing is being done to stop it from

1356.81 --> 1363.94
top down then I know where what that had

1360.05 --> 1367.73
does the people that are part of that

1363.94 --> 1371.06
it's very creepy and she probably did

1367.73 --> 1373.85
hold a couple of details back but like

1371.06 --> 1376.31
yeah why would she why would she not you

1373.85 --> 1379.34
know it's it's already plenty of things

1376.31 --> 1382.9299999999998
that she shared in there it just goes to

1379.34 --> 1387.9199999999998
show that the system is is kind of like

1382.93 --> 1391.43
disjointed that the the spirit is kind

1387.92 --> 1394.0700000000002
of lost in the structure and now it's

1391.43 --> 1396.47
become just a mechanized dysfunctional

1394.07 --> 1398.4199999999998
thing that's kind of what she really

1396.47 --> 1402.69
tried to describe that's what I picked

1398.42 --> 1405.66
up on and that was very intense

1402.69 --> 1415.95
domani that part and that was basically

1405.66 --> 1420.5
throughout the entire video overly

1415.95 --> 1423.66
technical to establish credibility right

1420.5 --> 1426.27
but she was basically laying down a

1423.66 --> 1430.0500000000002
really heavy thing so of course she

1426.27 --> 1432.93
would have been afraid of ya

1430.05 --> 1435.06
credibility's and all that it was

1432.93 --> 1438.66
technically risky what she was doing so

1435.06 --> 1444.03
of course as for the racial tones well

1438.66 --> 1448.97
that may simply be because of her her

1444.03 --> 1455.31
background training that she may just be

1448.97 --> 1457.98
like that like really have this super

1455.31 --> 1460.02
racial consciousness like from the

1457.98 --> 1463.1100000000001
leftist angle because she did kind of

1460.02 --> 1466.5
seem like a left leftist type not a

1463.11 --> 1469.8799999999999
dummy leftist type but like that you

1466.5 --> 1474.84
know so that would make sense

1469.88 --> 1477.0300000000002
like I figured that out pretty early on

1474.84 --> 1481.05
I did just like yeah that's just what

1477.03 --> 1484.92
she's gonna emphasize doesn't really

1481.05 --> 1490.05
take away from the entire thing she put

1484.92 --> 1491.5800000000002
down I think now of course this is she's

1490.05 --> 1494.34
a real neural nurse then of course

1491.58 --> 1497.46
you're part of the system she literally

1494.34 --> 1500.52
said she is in it she that's her job

1497.46 --> 1502.94
and it's just crazy but that job is part

1500.52 --> 1502.94
of the system

1512.85 --> 1515.9099999999999
[Music]

1527.71 --> 1530.549
all right

1538.409 --> 1545.169
hmm and guess Missouri bears not here

1541.239 --> 1548.6190000000001
oh right madam yeah I would if you're

1545.169 --> 1553.5590000000002
still there and you want copyright

1548.619 --> 1553.559
strike me thanks appreciate that Adam

1554.579 --> 1558.029
let's see

1563.06 --> 1569.9199999999998
let's get this thing it is really

1565.88 --> 1569.92
awesome dough yeah

1572.89 --> 1596.64
and I'm yeah you should definitely name

1576.309 --> 1599.9099999999999
it fe d HQ absolutely okay all right

1596.64 --> 1599.91

1681.54 --> 1691.8899999999999
Adam did it again it's incredible

1687.62 --> 1696.809
I'm definitely gonna replay that first I

1691.89 --> 1699.929
need to figure out how to freakin get

1696.809 --> 1706.94
this thing all right

1699.929 --> 1706.94
oh yes drives me nuts sometimes

1716.98 --> 1723.54
all right yeah I'm gonna replay it again

1719.49 --> 1723.54
because it is that awesome

1726.04 --> 1736.04
[Music]

1739.01 --> 1806.95
[Music]

1799.539 --> 1806.95
yeah there was a freak man

1814.94 --> 1821.06
you know what it kind of is because yeah

1824.63 --> 1832.1100000000001
look Alex Jones on his channel thing

1829.05 --> 1833.85
like has these advertisement clips in

1832.11 --> 1835.9499999999998
between sort of like submit bits of

1833.85 --> 1839.01
information or like something really

1835.95 --> 1841.74
funny or just more product advertising

1839.01 --> 1848.01
but also like these in-between snippets

1841.74 --> 1851.7
and this thing is like perfectly like

1848.01 --> 1854.67
that except concerning Flat Earth it's

1851.7 --> 1863.1200000000001
like like a perfect in-between snippet

1854.67 --> 1863.1200000000001
it's it's awesome and it is awesome yeah

1863.48 --> 1873.93
have I found myself on it hmm I don't

1868.83 --> 1879.35
know let me hold it let's see where am I

1873.93 --> 1885.42
oh yeah I'm well half my face is like

1879.35 --> 1887.8799999999999
right to the right bottom it's that

1885.42 --> 1890.15
photo from when I had a headphone on way

1887.88 --> 1890.15
back

1894.88 --> 1903.63
send you to file in Skype all right yeah

1901.06 --> 1903.6299999999999
I checked it out

1909.8 --> 1917.27
the above van on the Oh on the van

1913.67 --> 1921.8300000000002
what all right

1917.27 --> 1926.18
oh hey I'm on this twice okay

1921.83 --> 1929.12
I hadn't oh all right

1926.18 --> 1934.42
it's from Amsterdam from that time when

1929.12 --> 1938.78
my hair was terrible that's all right

1934.42 --> 1941.66
good times no but I'm also here like at

1938.78 --> 1943.91
the bottom right like in the low go to

1941.66 --> 1947.02
the bottom slightly to the right that's

1943.91 --> 1947.02
half my face there

1959.96 --> 1966.1390000000001
but it's really cool like combined photo

1963.249 --> 1969.22
there's all these group photos it is

1966.139 --> 1969.2199999999998
pretty awesome what you did

1991.289 --> 2000.149
and by the way Adam what like where did

1994.149 --> 2003.3899999999999
you get that animation that did did you

2000.149 --> 2006.0
make that from scratch seems a lot of

2003.39 --> 2009.5
work but I almost think that that you

2006.0 --> 2013.38
must have gotten that from some other

2009.5 --> 2015.33
thing somebody else made that and it was

2013.38 --> 2017.1000000000001
just really good and you put the stuff

2015.33 --> 2026.309
together or something like how did you

2017.1 --> 2028.139
do that because I could imagine that the

2026.309 --> 2030.539
animation for example from the molten

2028.139 --> 2032.9399999999998
iron core that one was so extensive you

2030.539 --> 2035.429
know that must have been made by

2032.94 --> 2039.059
somebody just trying to explain in how

2035.429 --> 2040.909
it's supposed to be you know so it could

2039.059 --> 2044.1589999999999
have just been made by a heliocentric

2040.909 --> 2047.0390000000002
it's an a very impressive animation and

2044.159 --> 2049.589
Adam just used that to prove the

2047.039 --> 2051.119
opposite really stock footage that I

2049.589 --> 2054.179
compiled from different sources right

2051.119 --> 2056.869
right well it's it's astonishing what

2054.179 --> 2060.089
you got together there is really great

2056.869 --> 2062.659
than graphics and text overlay right

2060.089 --> 2062.659
right

2064.949 --> 2068.039
[Music]

2084.51 --> 2088.619
world-class plagiarist

2103.83 --> 2109.62
all right yeah not praise to add a meek

2106.47 --> 2114.6
and he is ace remember don't forget he

2109.62 --> 2117.63
also pretty much found made this the

2114.6 --> 2120.24
show look and the what is it

2117.63 --> 2127.44
no the the icon over there in the corner

2120.24 --> 2131.1
upper corner left corner so yeah and his

2127.44 --> 2133.44
technique is indeed just drafting it but

2131.1 --> 2135.63
why wouldn't you you know it's the

2133.44 --> 2139.29
freakin Internet there's like billions

2135.63 --> 2142.79
of pictures and stuff and things just

2139.29 --> 2146.85
everywhere pretty much up for grabs and

2142.79 --> 2150.21
this guy knows how to get it he has this

2146.85 --> 2153.87
talent for just finding [ __ ] I don't

2150.21 --> 2158.76
know how to do that I sometimes get

2153.87 --> 2161.69
lucky but yeah Adam has brought it to a

2158.76 --> 2161.69
whole new level

2171.24 --> 2174.3799999999997
[Music]

2192.04 --> 2202.6
yes and though all right yeah I'm still

2197.86 --> 2204.2200000000003
kind of puzzled about yesterday when we

2202.6 --> 2206.65
were talking about relative density

2204.22 --> 2210.58
again I think was that yesterday right

2206.65 --> 2214.57
was right and this guy was kept on

2210.58 --> 2219.48
asking or suggesting like how does the

2214.57 --> 2224.9700000000003
object know which direction to go like

2219.48 --> 2228.52
all-knowing objects remember that one

2224.97 --> 2232.9599999999996
like how do they know which direction

2228.52 --> 2239.14
it's so funny that they really thought

2232.96 --> 2242.83
like that almost like just animating

2239.14 --> 2245.49
this this sentience to just an inanimate

2242.83 --> 2245.49
object

2269.12 --> 2278.5699999999997
[Music]

2275.29 --> 2282.59
isn't that just amazing Daftary in chat

2278.57 --> 2285.56
here it's gonna groom too much just yet

2282.59 --> 2289.28
that I bring up something that's really

2285.56 --> 2293.57
silly and he as part of the baller the

2289.28 --> 2297.1400000000003
thoughts legacy literally picks that up

2293.57 --> 2299.3500000000004
and says it's a good question isn't that

2297.14 --> 2304.12
amazing

2299.35 --> 2304.12
it's just they really don't get it

2313.87 --> 2323.3489999999997
I asked ya

2318.04 --> 2325.359
was it you deaf every that asked how

2323.349 --> 2328.63
does it know which direction to follow

2325.359 --> 2330.5699999999997
it just goes with the directions that

2328.63 --> 2334.6600000000003
are set

2330.57 --> 2337.42
you could argue conceptually that it

2334.66 --> 2341.3199999999997
knows which direction to go by all the

2337.42 --> 2347.079
other things moving along that alignment

2341.32 --> 2349.63
which it effectively is it just follows

2347.079 --> 2353.5
in step with the alignment now you can

2349.63 --> 2356.05
all presupposition Lee model this out by

2353.5 --> 2359.589
a conceptualization of gravity force

2356.05 --> 2362.02
disequilibrium pre supposedly right

2359.589 --> 2363.94
yeah well works out great you can model

2362.02 --> 2367.38
it easy yeah that's I admitted that

2363.94 --> 2370.93
that's the aberration that's what make G

2367.38 --> 2373.2400000000002
such a handy tool mathematically makes

2370.93 --> 2377.8289999999997
things very easy to oversee it all works

2373.24 --> 2381.8799999999997
out right it's not real though as it is

2377.829 --> 2385.63
still just a effect it it comes forth

2381.88 --> 2389.02
the alignment effectively comes forth

2385.63 --> 2392.829
from relative density but you can't

2389.02 --> 2395.829
change the alignment it's impossible to

2392.829 --> 2400.0
alter the alignment other than by

2395.829 --> 2404.02
introducing motion or accelerated motion

2400.0 --> 2408.46
in some way then you get alignment

2404.02 --> 2410.65
alterations and yeah that plays even

2408.46 --> 2412.18
further into here but that means then

2410.65 --> 2415.48
that there is a force disequilibrium

2412.18 --> 2418.66
because the other force motion is

2415.48 --> 2421.38
offsetting the like the alignment right

2418.66 --> 2425.89
that makes it even stronger suggestion

2421.38 --> 2427.78
it's still not provable though now it's

2425.89 --> 2431.77
very frustrating to everyone it was very

2427.78 --> 2436.02
frustrating to me so yeah you can

2431.77 --> 2438.4
absolutely use little G the

2436.02 --> 2443.17
conceptualization of a force this

2438.4 --> 2446.17
equilibrium but that's only for fair use

2443.17 --> 2448.06
you can't use that as kind of

2446.17 --> 2450.85
foundational proof or anything it's only

2448.06 --> 2454.35
as a tool that it's hand

2450.85 --> 2458.73
for whatever you want to achieve with it

2454.35 --> 2461.74
but as when for scientific related

2458.73 --> 2464.2
evidences ya know you can't use it

2461.74 --> 2467.7
because it is conceptual there is no

2464.2 --> 2471.43
evidence for no physical empirical

2467.7 --> 2473.9399999999996
evidence that you could yeah in some way

2471.43 --> 2479.14
used to create some kind of viable

2473.94 --> 2482.17
hypothesis for gravity that's why one of

2479.14 --> 2486.37
the housekeeping questions are any

2482.17 --> 2496.36
scientific hypothesis or any scientific

2486.37 --> 2500.71
evidence for gravity right and since

2496.36 --> 2503.71
gravity is an effect and specifically an

2500.71 --> 2505.63
effect that you cannot vary yeah the

2503.71 --> 2507.25
phenomena of the effect you can't very

2505.63 --> 2509.56
manipulate it you can't change the

2507.25 --> 2514.6
alignment right except for changing

2509.56 --> 2518.17
something else well because of that it's

2514.6 --> 2521.7999999999997
an effect that you cannot prove the

2518.17 --> 2526.1800000000003
cause for you can only change something

2521.8 --> 2528.8100000000004
else with any kind of in any kind of

2526.18 --> 2528.81
experiment

2529.63 --> 2534.4
so there you go that's why it's an

2531.73 --> 2536.859
aberration aberration is not just some

2534.4 --> 2539.4
random word that I made up I picked that

2536.859 --> 2539.4
very carefully

2540.91 --> 2544.12
[Music]

2545.88 --> 2553.7200000000003
an aberration is like a very suggestive

2549.839 --> 2555.94
structure that leads to a structural

2553.72 --> 2560.23
mistake and it's like bound to happen

2555.94 --> 2563.109
because it it's there naturally it it

2560.23 --> 2565.359
comes it's a natural side-effect of the

2563.109 --> 2569.41
design of all things and we just haven't

2565.359 --> 2578.44
completely figured it all out so there

2569.41 --> 2582.3089999999997
is something there but yeah it is kinda

2578.44 --> 2585.25
secondary it's not the effect is not the

2582.309 --> 2587.65
thing really the fact is more like a

2585.25 --> 2591.069
side effect the alignment is like a side

2587.65 --> 2596.289
effect of yeah effective relative

2591.069 --> 2599.68
density and that thing you can prove by

2596.289 --> 2603.039
very manipulating the phenomena and then

2599.68 --> 2604.839
proving that yeah this placement does

2603.039 --> 2607.7200000000003
happen because of relative density

2604.839 --> 2610.019
differences between an object and a

2607.72 --> 2610.019
media

2616.05 --> 2620.9700000000003
right yeah well bilgey mass being

2618.96 --> 2624.26
attracted to mass is not part of the

2620.97 --> 2629.22
relative density theory at all and

2624.26 --> 2634.65
neither is it really honestly part of

2629.22 --> 2639.8999999999996
the Einstein gravity concept because it

2634.65 --> 2642.6
is I guess suggested that the gravity

2639.9 --> 2645.9
there is caused by mass attracting to

2642.6 --> 2650.04
mass gravity but effectively that's

2645.9 --> 2655.05
unproven there's it's not even suggested

2650.04 --> 2657.15
that there is proof for that it's left

2655.05 --> 2660.15
open it's just saying no there is this

2657.15 --> 2661.92
for this force well almost like a

2660.15 --> 2666.2400000000002
spacetime bending and that's an

2661.92 --> 2668.9700000000003
effective force and supposedly but it

2666.24 --> 2671.52
kind of leaves open that it is

2668.97 --> 2674.7
supposedly caused by this preponderance

2671.52 --> 2682.28
of the mass now it's suggested but it's

2674.7 --> 2682.2799999999997
not effectively a part of that concept

2682.4 --> 2688.02
but yeah people will still of course

2685.83 --> 2692.4
drag that in there and even say oh it's

2688.02 --> 2694.83
no it's Newton is part of that the

2692.4 --> 2697.8
Newton theory that Newton himself didn't

2694.83 --> 2700.59
claim a hypothesis for there still say

2697.8 --> 2705.8100000000004
that it's true anyway and they will then

2700.59 --> 2707.79
stick it into the Einstein gravity idea

2705.81 --> 2709.44
because they don't understand it they

2707.79 --> 2711.18
don't understand what's really going on

2709.44 --> 2713.85
what's been stated about it how things

2711.18 --> 2717.93
have developed over the decades for the

2713.85 --> 2720.8399999999997
century and so they then just say no no

2717.93 --> 2723.5299999999997
no no massive he's still attracted by

2720.84 --> 2728.04
mass according to our side this is no no

2723.53 --> 2731.94
it's just not true it's effectively not

2728.04 --> 2737.2799999999997
true you could think that it's true but

2731.94 --> 2741.5
it's not part of the model because it

2737.28 --> 2743.7000000000003
bypasses that it goes into space-time

2741.5 --> 2748.14
conceptualization and bending of that

2743.7 --> 2749.5499999999997
which is kind of odd to even describe

2748.14 --> 2754.2799999999997
what deads

2749.55 --> 2757.23
to do that's why people when asked to

2754.28 --> 2762.36
explain like what does it effectively do

2757.23 --> 2766.23
they just compare what space-time is

2762.36 --> 2771.23
supposed to be doing in relation to the

2766.23 --> 2774.69
normal by comparing it with some some

2771.23 --> 2777.48
two-dimensional shape or like yeah the

2774.69 --> 2781.17
been the trampoline effect they will

2777.48 --> 2783.2400000000002
give metaphors it's always metaphor

2781.17 --> 2787.11
description of what's supposed to be

2783.24 --> 2790.35
going on in the pseudo rimoni enforced

2787.11 --> 2793.2000000000003
space with gravity but it doesn't

2790.35 --> 2794.48
actually explain how that ties in to the

2793.2 --> 2797.7599999999998
real thing

2794.48 --> 2802.08
that's why nobody actually gives that

2797.76 --> 2804.2400000000002
explanation like I right now could not

2802.08 --> 2806.64
give you that explanation even if I

2804.24 --> 2807.9199999999996
really want to do trust me I've tried to

2806.64 --> 2812.3399999999997
figure it out

2807.92 --> 2814.02
it's not there you can think it's there

2812.34 --> 2816.69
but you're never gonna find it and

2814.02 --> 2820.7
that's why nobody brings it up because

2816.69 --> 2824.75
it is dislocated from physical reality

2820.7 --> 2829.71
by having introduced this fictional

2824.75 --> 2833.91
dimensional element and there's no tying

2829.71 --> 2838.77
it back really into normal physical

2833.91 --> 2842.93
reality once a conception enters the

2838.77 --> 2842.93
domain of pseudo Ramon Ian's for space

2844.46 --> 2849.05
as anybody else take a notice of this

2850.79 --> 2855.27
there's nobody can tell you how it

2853.47 --> 2858.5899999999997
affects the real world they will just

2855.27 --> 2861.93
tell you or they will just give you a

2858.59 --> 2865.05
metaphorical description of what it's

2861.93 --> 2868.1699999999996
supposed to be which doesn't really

2865.05 --> 2870.36
explains it's just try to explain what

2868.17 --> 2873.69
it's supposed to be what's supposed to

2870.36 --> 2876.54
be happening not how it effectively

2873.69 --> 2879.68
works in the real world it's only a

2876.54 --> 2879.68
metaphor every time

2894.66 --> 2900.589
yeah pseudo forces alright

2906.27 --> 2914.46
right there is in the science developed

2911.55 --> 2916.9500000000003
there seems to be a lot of need to try

2914.46 --> 2920.04
to think of things as forces when there

2916.95 --> 2923.43
are really just an effect natural like

2920.04 --> 2925.95
within the Coriolis effect that you can

2923.43 --> 2928.44
think of it as a pseudo force well there

2925.95 --> 2929.9399999999996
is literally no force happening me I

2928.44 --> 2932.67
don't think that's happening is it's

2929.94 --> 2935.16
just a relative displacement between

2932.67 --> 2938.4500000000003
reference frames so there's motion

2935.16 --> 2941.67
there's no extra force the forces are

2938.45 --> 2948.06
really already subjected to the

2941.67 --> 2950.9
reference frame that that's the thing

2948.06 --> 2956.4
that's having some force subjected to it

2950.9 --> 2961.23
but the other object that's going loose

2956.4 --> 2967.7400000000002
from the reference frame does not it's

2961.23 --> 2971.09
just following a literal pathway from

2967.74 --> 2974.3999999999996
its own yeah from its own orientation

2971.09 --> 2977.25
whatever is the what is it the original

2974.4 --> 2979.38
reference frame I'm not know the type of

2977.25 --> 2982.32
reference frames confuses the [ __ ] outta

2979.38 --> 2984.3900000000003
me I try to avoid Coriolis discussions

2982.32 --> 2986.9700000000003
when it comes to technical words because

2984.39 --> 2990.42
of it but yeah Nathan can explain this

2986.97 --> 2992.8799999999997
part a lot but I'm good at relative

2990.42 --> 2995.3
density Coriolis effect situations not

2992.88 --> 2995.3
so much

3005.369 --> 3012.01
non-inertial reference frame right is

3007.78 --> 3014.71
the one that is the stationary original

3012.01 --> 3016.869
the world stationary reference frame

3014.71 --> 3019.75
that is right that that's the

3016.869 --> 3025.53
non-inertial right because if inertia

3019.75 --> 3028.9
means non moving there's no motion

3025.53 --> 3032.38
related things going on so non inertial

3028.9 --> 3034.119
reference frame should be basically the

3032.38 --> 3035.9700000000003
world reference frame the stationary

3034.119 --> 3048.359
world reference frame right

3035.97 --> 3048.359
anyway Flat Earth debates soon start up

3049.77 --> 3054.869
so round out my show in a few minutes

3055.619 --> 3059.19
where's everybody gone

3080.0 --> 3083.13
[Music]

3093.02 --> 3096.02
yeah

3098.87 --> 3107.8399999999997
yeah maybe I kind of bored them a little

3101.75 --> 3109.97
bye talk of Coriolis you know Coriolis

3107.84 --> 3117.2200000000003
talk used to give me a bit of a headache

3109.97 --> 3117.22
as well makes my head spin

3127.26 --> 3138.28
you know what I'm gonna round out the

3130.24 --> 3140.7999999999997
show but before I do that I'm gonna play

3138.28 --> 3142.5400000000004
at a Meekins awesome video again because

3140.8 --> 3151.57
it's just freakin awesome and I want to

3142.54 --> 3153.66
round out on that a third time's the

3151.57 --> 3153.6600000000003
charm

3161.19 --> 3168.55
all right what

3165.95 --> 3168.5499999999997
wait

3169.44 --> 3207.11
is this that's the wrong one huh

3173.99 --> 3207.1099999999997
[Music]

3211.18 --> 3248.0
[Applause]

3212.53 --> 3248.0
[Music]

3273.92 --> 3279.8
oh you're right I muted thank you thank

3276.71 --> 3281.75
you thank you I am gonna round out the

3279.8 --> 3283.67
show now so thanks everyone for coming

3281.75 --> 3285.38
if you like to show please don't forget

3283.67 --> 3287.12
to Rogen's it up and if you haven't

3285.38 --> 3288.6800000000003
already subscribed to my channel and hit

3287.12 --> 3290.6
the bell notification so you know when

3288.68 --> 3292.37
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

3290.6 --> 3294.38
p.m. Amsterdam time every day

3292.37 --> 3296.3599999999997
please also do support me through the

3294.38 --> 3298.46
paypal patreon my GoFundMe the superjet

3296.36 --> 3301.01
and the membership system that would be

3298.46 --> 3303.77
much appreciated I'll be back tomorrow

3301.01 --> 3305.5400000000004
with Flat Earth early bird number 532

3303.77 --> 3309.74
and I'm gonna join the Flat Earth

3305.54 --> 3314.0
debates right after this the hashtag

3309.74 --> 3317.83
meifa indeed Steve and until the next

3314.0 --> 3317.83
video keep it flat

3318.18 --> 3341.109
[Music]

3343.67 --> 3345.73
you

3354.33 --> 3356.39
you
