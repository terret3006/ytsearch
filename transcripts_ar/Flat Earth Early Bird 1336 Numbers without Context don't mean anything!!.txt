123.6 --> 125.83999999999999
like

126.479 --> 131.52
it's been kind of raining all day this

128.239 --> 133.52
is one of the few dry moments

131.52 --> 136.31900000000002
oh dry is a big word there's a lot of

133.52 --> 136.31900000000002
moist in the air

136.48 --> 140.879
uh yeah rain

138.959 --> 143.28
it seemed to have dried up pretty

140.879 --> 145.76
quickly most spots there's a

143.28 --> 147.92
bit of a puddle back there on the street

145.76 --> 147.92
but

148.319 --> 151.83999999999997
yeah that water was pretty quickly

150.48 --> 154.39999999999998
absorbed

151.84 --> 154.4
i'd say

154.879 --> 160.72
but yeah it's fully clouded

158.16 --> 163.44
barely any wind and there is regular

160.72 --> 163.44
rain so

165.36 --> 170.64000000000001
but yeah i kind of like it at a really

168.0 --> 174.16
good night's sleep

170.64 --> 174.16
because it cooled down so much

177.2 --> 181.76
right

179.36 --> 182.84
hello mike's lunch first in chat good to

181.76 --> 187.04

187.04 --> 190.04
2022.

193.599 --> 197.67999999999998
hello steamy traveler

195.44 --> 199.84
ray shirt yeah

197.68 --> 201.88
yeah look i only don't wear a shirt when

199.84 --> 203.36
it's just really too hot to not

201.88 --> 206.239
[Music]

203.36 --> 206.239
to not do that

206.799 --> 210.31900000000002
i mean yeah when it's just too hot to

208.799 --> 212.72
wear a shirt

210.319 --> 214.95899999999997
because if i'm just sitting here

212.72 --> 217.2
and then just my shirt is just going to

214.959 --> 218.72
get icky

217.2 --> 220.879
so

218.72 --> 225.319
but yeah i prefer wearing a shoe or two

220.879 --> 225.319
on my shows to be fair

231.04 --> 233.35999999999999
right

234.3 --> 240.20000000000002
[Music]

236.08 --> 240.20000000000002
it's 21 degrees celsius

240.879 --> 246.64
eighty-two percent humidity eighty

243.2 --> 246.64
percent participation

252.84 --> 257.76
right avjc net let's see you

263.12 --> 266.8
right

264.88 --> 268.32
i took the title i wanted

266.8 --> 271.8
from yesterday's show and put it on

268.32 --> 271.8
today's show

282.56 --> 288.16
all right also got another illuminati

285.28 --> 288.15999999999997
crossover here

288.639 --> 292.88
but yeah i feel weird it's just the

290.96 --> 295.44
temperature shifts that much it's just

292.88 --> 300.04
weird so i am kind of hungry but also at

295.44 --> 300.04
the same time not super hungry

302.06 --> 305.31
[Music]

315.28 --> 320.79999999999995
so yesterday's flat earth debate was

317.36 --> 322.32
great super long live show

320.8 --> 325.84000000000003
might have noticed there was like a

322.32 --> 325.84
two-hour live show

326.16 --> 330.96000000000004
and yeah intense

328.72 --> 334.47900000000004
more ether

330.96 --> 334.479
i think it was dive slow again

335.36 --> 343.199
it just went on a full blown ether tour

340.639 --> 343.199
same [ __ ]

344.21 --> 349.96
[Music]

345.36 --> 349.96000000000004
it's really the new thing that's going

360.77 --> 363.899
[Music]

365.6 --> 367.84000000000003
right

370.8 --> 374.08
also

372.08 --> 376.4
i think was it yesterday or the day

374.08 --> 378.479
before i don't remember

376.4 --> 380.71999999999997
but if it was the day before i forgot to

378.479 --> 384.08
mention it

380.72 --> 386.72
i think i saw somebody die

384.08 --> 389.75899999999996
like some woman that might not might not

386.72 --> 390.96000000000004
be death but like somebody was laying on

389.759 --> 394.319
the

390.96 --> 396.63899999999995
on the sidewalk in front of a store

394.319 --> 398.24
like really panicking and crying out

396.639 --> 400.96000000000004
loud

398.24 --> 402.24
might have been just like myocarditis or

400.96 --> 404.56
something

402.24 --> 406.479
but like it felt like that like was

404.56 --> 409.759
vaccine

406.479 --> 411.919
related because she was just so in panic

409.759 --> 413.44
and like yeah you're not gonna be in

411.919 --> 414.18
panic unless you really have a good

413.44 --> 416.56
reason for that

414.18 --> 418.72
[Music]

416.56 --> 420.96
i did witness that that was pretty grim

418.72 --> 420.96000000000004
like

421.759 --> 426.56
i basically just bicycled past it

424.96 --> 429.52
she did have like

426.56 --> 431.199
several people with her

429.52 --> 433.12
but just yeah it's like one of the first

431.199 --> 434.88
time i'm actually seeing somebody in the

433.12 --> 438.16
middle of that

434.88 --> 438.15999999999997
still happening out here

444.0 --> 449.919
although yeah there was no ambulance or

446.639 --> 451.599
anything but that might have come later

449.919 --> 454.08
it might have just been like a really

451.599 --> 455.68
big panic attack or something that she

454.08 --> 458.24
was afraid

455.68 --> 462.319
that she had that and didn't just panic

458.24 --> 462.319
it i don't know but it did like

462.8 --> 466.16
i thought it was kind of telling

467.759 --> 472.24
the first time in like

470.96 --> 473.919
two

472.24 --> 476.8
two and a half years that i'm even

473.919 --> 476.79999999999995
seeing that so

477.44 --> 480.879
surprised i haven't seen it more

482.24 --> 486.639
ah

484.56 --> 489.639
that

486.639 --> 489.639
happened

492.08 --> 497.919
oh yeah quantum eraser was live but i

494.72 --> 497.91900000000004
completely missed it

501.28 --> 507.84
i think i was

503.919 --> 507.84
distracted by jimbo

510.639 --> 514.9590000000001
who typically goes live at the same hour

517.839 --> 520.839
um

525.839 --> 529.6
yeah i've been watching my own benjamin

529.76 --> 533.64
very interesting stuff

534.16 --> 536.399
uh

538.48 --> 543.9200000000001
i think that was mostly it

540.56 --> 545.1199999999999
i've been watching also old manga siri

543.92 --> 548.4799999999999
series

545.12 --> 550.24
they have never actually watched

548.48 --> 552.5600000000001
and now i know why

550.24 --> 554.9590000000001
but i'm watching it now

552.56 --> 556.16
evangelion wow

554.959 --> 558.88
it is

556.16 --> 561.12
very squirtish

558.88 --> 561.12
it's

561.68 --> 566.88
it is very

563.92 --> 566.88
very squirtish

569.92 --> 575.36
like that series is just so incredibly

573.12 --> 578.32
silly really when you think about it

575.36 --> 580.16
it's just so silly

578.32 --> 581.839
but i guess it appeals to a whole bunch

580.16 --> 585.519
of young kids

581.839 --> 587.519
because it is really aimed at young kids

585.519 --> 589.04
like it would have to be otherwise you

587.519 --> 591.12
would be like as a teenager there and

589.04 --> 593.12
like uh

591.12 --> 594.32
this kid sucks

593.12 --> 597.839
and he does

594.32 --> 599.6
the main character he just sucks

597.839 --> 602.24
like this

599.6 --> 605.839
teenager that's like really mopey and a

602.24 --> 605.839
bit artistic and like

606.16 --> 611.1999999999999
and always like oh

607.839 --> 613.519
surrounded by ladies that are like what

611.2 --> 615.519
is it like 10 years older or something

613.519 --> 618.72
like what the [ __ ] what like what the

615.519 --> 622.64
hell even is this series man

618.72 --> 624.8000000000001
but anyway like the big robot stuff

622.64 --> 626.079
which is the other half it is kind of

624.8 --> 627.5999999999999
cool

626.079 --> 629.8389999999999
i mean

627.6 --> 632.9590000000001
it's very obvious that things like uh

629.839 --> 633.839
pacific rim have definitely be le have

632.959 --> 635.68
been

633.839 --> 638.72
lent from

635.68 --> 638.7199999999999
a series like that

641.04 --> 646.079
because yeah it is kind of old it's it's

643.279 --> 649.2
really surprising when you look how how

646.079 --> 649.1999999999999
old that series is

649.519 --> 653.12
it's like the 80s or something

653.6 --> 657.24
let me check it out

664.64 --> 669.04
oh there's a movie too i've not watched

666.8 --> 669.04
that

672.0 --> 676.24
it's interesting i will definitely also

674.32 --> 680.9200000000001
check out some of those movies but i'm

676.24 --> 680.92
watching the series now on netflix

689.63 --> 692.6899999999999
[Music]

697.6 --> 700.32
what

698.72 --> 701.279
95

700.32 --> 702.5600000000001
oh

701.279 --> 704.88
i thought it would have been older than

702.56 --> 704.88
that

706.959 --> 712.04
i guess it is from 95. weird

729.2 --> 735.12
hey hello scott

731.519 --> 735.12
scott who has changed his name

737.76 --> 740.88
that's that's cool

742.0 --> 747.36
right so yeah watching that

744.399 --> 749.839
just feeling back god damn it when i was

747.36 --> 751.279
12 years old i was also a squirt boy

749.839 --> 753.12
just like that

751.279 --> 755.519
less mopey

753.12 --> 757.68
more doe eyed type

755.519 --> 761.279
but damn it yeah i used to be like that

757.68 --> 763.5999999999999
too that is really what that series

761.279 --> 765.8389999999999
reminds me of

763.6 --> 765.839
uh

767.12 --> 770.72
it is kind of a relief being much older

769.44 --> 773.519
and just

770.72 --> 775.839
being able to like

773.519 --> 779.2
see and interact with women without all

775.839 --> 781.36
getting all shaky and all that this is

779.2 --> 781.36
like

781.44 --> 787.72
like having no control over where your

783.92 --> 787.7199999999999
eyes wander and all that

791.68 --> 797.04
hey professor phil bell

795.2 --> 801.6800000000001
what does the title of the video

797.04 --> 804.7199999999999
specifically relate to well it

801.68 --> 807.3599999999999
very unspecifically relates to almost

804.72 --> 807.36
everything

810.32 --> 813.12
almost everything

812.399 --> 814.959
is

813.12 --> 816.9590000000001
how i like it but

814.959 --> 820.2399999999999
yeah the thing is

816.959 --> 823.5189999999999
it's about the numbers again it's about

820.24 --> 826.48
if you pursue number numerology or

823.519 --> 826.48
gematria

827.279 --> 832.48
you might become like obsessed with it

829.68 --> 835.12
and then just start finding numbers but

832.48 --> 838.399
here's the thing

835.12 --> 841.68
the context is always more important

838.399 --> 844.32
you see you could find 33 for example

841.68 --> 845.92
very typical used number

844.32 --> 847.44
for coding and

845.92 --> 849.519
messaging

847.44 --> 850.48
occultly even

849.519 --> 852.16
in

850.48 --> 854.399
things

852.16 --> 857.92
but unless

854.399 --> 859.199
the context is right it's just a number

857.92 --> 863.92
it is just

859.199 --> 865.12
33 it could something can actually be 33

863.92 --> 866.8
right

865.12 --> 870.32
but if it is

866.8 --> 872.16
if the text in which it is is like very

870.32 --> 874.9590000000001
weird

872.16 --> 876.7199999999999
and very unconfirmed like it's for

874.959 --> 878.6389999999999
example claims about things that have

876.72 --> 879.76
happened

878.639 --> 881.76
that

879.76 --> 884.48
yeah you can't really find a lot of

881.76 --> 887.68
feedback about or there's no live

884.48 --> 891.519
footage or photo photograph

887.68 --> 894.3199999999999
then if there's a 33 in it then suddenly

891.519 --> 895.519
it does become suspicious

894.32 --> 896.839
why

895.519 --> 900.24
because of the

896.839 --> 902.639
context and that's what my title truly

900.24 --> 905.6800000000001
relates to numbers without context don't

902.639 --> 909.6
mean anything it is the context that

905.68 --> 913.8389999999999
turns the numbers into a potential code

909.6 --> 913.839
without the context it's just a number

914.72 --> 920.72
so that is mostly what the title is

917.04 --> 920.7199999999999
about hope that explains it

921.279 --> 925.36
hey the price of atom

923.76 --> 928.92
terra 306

925.36 --> 928.92
arena wumbo

940.0 --> 945.92
yeah look also rig back hello

942.8 --> 947.68
what do you mean for 20 69 no contacts

945.92 --> 949.8389999999999
needed what

947.68 --> 949.8389999999999
no

950.0 --> 956.639
what is the context of 33 well

953.12 --> 957.759
that's a straw man question

956.639 --> 961.04
because

957.759 --> 964.639
the point is is that the context is not

961.04 --> 965.68
the number the context is

964.639 --> 967.839
the

965.68 --> 971.04
text

967.839 --> 973.2790000000001
in which there might be the number 33

971.04 --> 976.079
found

973.279 --> 979.079
numbers don't have context they're

976.079 --> 979.079
numbers

983.759 --> 988.5600000000001
right the only contacts they have are

985.839 --> 991.12
the ones that are assigned to it through

988.56 --> 994.16
disciplines like geomatria

991.12 --> 994.16
and numerology

994.639 --> 999.199
but that's not the inherent context

1000.079 --> 1004.5999999999999
that's an attributed context

1019.279 --> 1023.16
are you following me

1025.6 --> 1031.039
what is that mean

1027.839 --> 1031.039
meant to signify

1031.76 --> 1037.559
well it might signify like there is

1038.0 --> 1041.839
potential

1039.679 --> 1045.679
hidden in plain sight

1041.839 --> 1047.839
foul context it might signify that

1045.679 --> 1050.64
like freemason

1047.839 --> 1050.6399999999999
or occult

1050.96 --> 1056.96
programming groups might be involved

1053.36 --> 1056.9599999999998
that is what it signifies

1057.12 --> 1063.4399999999998
it is like a joker number it can be used

1059.919 --> 1063.44
like a joker number you see

1063.679 --> 1070.0
you have an article it says oh this and

1065.679 --> 1072.0
this happened and oh 33 victims

1070.0 --> 1073.919
no names

1072.0 --> 1076.32
no photos no

1073.919 --> 1079.6000000000001
actual on the scene proof

1076.32 --> 1082.6399999999999
well 33 victims oh

1079.6 --> 1085.1999999999998
right well that is extremely suspicious

1082.64 --> 1088.0800000000002
and then the 33 may simply be a

1085.2 --> 1090.64
signifier like this is

1088.08 --> 1093.12
this is a joke to fool you if you don't

1090.64 --> 1095.8400000000001
know it or if you don't see it you're to

1093.12 --> 1095.84
believe it

1096.4 --> 1100.64
i hope that answers the question arena

1101.76 --> 1105.36
hey susie s

1103.76 --> 1109.16
good to see you

1105.36 --> 1109.1599999999999
do i believe in numerology

1109.88 --> 1116.679
[Music]

1112.24 --> 1116.679
do you believe in bottled water

1126.4 --> 1130.88
i mean what kind of a question is that

1128.559 --> 1132.8799999999999
believe in numerology

1130.88 --> 1134.0
it's a discipline what is there to

1132.88 --> 1137.72
believe in

1134.0 --> 1137.72
it is what it is

1145.52 --> 1151.16
do you believe in bottled water

1147.6 --> 1151.1599999999999
professor filwell

1154.24 --> 1159.76
can't stand 80s hair metal what

1156.96 --> 1163.919
what does that have to do with anything

1159.76 --> 1163.919
but yeah it was kind of gay i agree

1175.84 --> 1179.36
do you think that numerology can tell

1177.76 --> 1182.24
you about a person

1179.36 --> 1182.24
or their future

1184.88 --> 1187.1200000000001
no

1190.16 --> 1194.16
it might help you

1192.559 --> 1197.039
guide

1194.16 --> 1197.039
sizing up

1197.12 --> 1200.9189999999999
but no not really

1209.679 --> 1213.44
right

1210.559 --> 1214.72
but by deriving

1213.44 --> 1215.76
their birth

1214.72 --> 1217.919
date

1215.76 --> 1221.12
and location

1217.919 --> 1223.44
interesting astrology information which

1221.12 --> 1224.7199999999998
is very ethereal

1223.44 --> 1227.6000000000001
might be

1224.72 --> 1230.159
taken and there is something to that

1227.6 --> 1232.24
like i don't even like it and i know

1230.159 --> 1233.6000000000001
there's that there is something to it

1232.24 --> 1237.36
yeah

1233.6 --> 1239.84
i don't like any of that personally

1237.36 --> 1241.6789999999999
i never engage with it somebody might do

1239.84 --> 1242.32
it with me but i tend to kind of avoid

1241.679 --> 1244.88
it

1242.32 --> 1246.6399999999999
but i do know there is something

1244.88 --> 1249.6000000000001
to astrology

1246.64 --> 1251.76
real astrology not the

1249.6 --> 1256.7199999999998
mystic mech

1251.76 --> 1256.72
and in the newspaper type astrology

1256.76 --> 1259.28
[Music]

1258.4 --> 1263.72
right

1259.28 --> 1263.72
but numerology is just numerology

1266.72 --> 1269.989
[Music]

1288.559 --> 1293.9189999999999
so you got a point to lead to you even

1291.2 --> 1295.039
got this sock account literally called

1293.919 --> 1297.3600000000001
suck

1295.039 --> 1299.36
to back you up

1297.36 --> 1302.08
what about the row cards

1299.36 --> 1305.84
it's the same thing

1302.08 --> 1305.84
it's exactly the same thing

1306.159 --> 1311.2800000000002
there's a system there

1308.799 --> 1315.28
it's a system a map

1311.28 --> 1317.6
of things that may happen of energies

1315.28 --> 1319.6
and

1317.6 --> 1322.08
that works

1319.6 --> 1324.7199999999998
but it all depends on how you approach

1322.08 --> 1327.4399999999998
it if you're gonna

1324.72 --> 1330.0
uh it's so esoteric i could explain it

1327.44 --> 1332.48
to you professor filbo but you literally

1330.0 --> 1335.76
will not understand

1332.48 --> 1339.919
you cannot i know you cannot

1335.76 --> 1341.2
i could barely explain it on like

1339.919 --> 1343.039
like in a way that people could

1341.2 --> 1345.52
understand in that seeking style what it

1343.039 --> 1350.32
would but seeking star wars gets it

1345.52 --> 1350.32
she made one right she knows what it is

1354.96 --> 1358.88
do you have a point here professor fill

1357.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
bell do you have a point with these

1358.88 --> 1361.8400000000001
questions

1374.24 --> 1377.6
you never answered the bottle of water

1376.4 --> 1381.64
question

1377.6 --> 1381.6399999999999
oh you thought that was a joke

1390.4 --> 1396.0
interested in my point of view

1393.76 --> 1396.0
why

1397.52 --> 1402.9189999999999
why are you interested in my point of

1399.36 --> 1402.9189999999999
view on that

1406.559 --> 1411.039
what's the point what's your point

1409.6 --> 1413.039
where are you going

1411.039 --> 1415.36
why do you need to know

1413.039 --> 1418.32
what is that leading to inside of your

1415.36 --> 1419.36
mind could you just

1418.32 --> 1422.6399999999999
like

1419.36 --> 1424.799
hello you're in my chat

1422.64 --> 1427.2
could you be more than just a robot

1424.799 --> 1427.2
please

1428.0 --> 1433.64
dude shut the [ __ ] up troll [ __ ] off

1449.6 --> 1454.0
hey tony whitcomb

1452.08 --> 1456.799
loads of new

1454.0 --> 1459.6
articles with 33 yeah for sure and those

1456.799 --> 1461.44
are extremely suspect

1459.6 --> 1462.7199999999998
especially news

1461.44 --> 1464.72
find a news

1462.72 --> 1467.6000000000001
article with 33 that you better damn

1464.72 --> 1469.3600000000001
well pay attention

1467.6 --> 1473.36
because unless there is a direct

1469.36 --> 1476.559
physical backup to prove that number

1473.36 --> 1479.6
like an actual list of names of literal

1476.559 --> 1481.6
33 names for example if it's just 33

1479.6 --> 1484.32
it's highly suspect if it's in a news

1481.6 --> 1485.4399999999998
article it always is does it mean it's

1484.32 --> 1486.6399999999999
always

1485.44 --> 1490.48
wrong

1486.64 --> 1493.279
it might just be sloppy writing

1490.48 --> 1496.52
but usually it is

1493.279 --> 1496.52
all right

1511.6 --> 1515.9189999999999
victims wouldn't be named until the next

1513.76 --> 1517.2
of kin are informed yeah that's i'm not

1515.919 --> 1521.5200000000002
saying that

1517.2 --> 1523.8400000000001
name list is essential i'm just saying

1521.52 --> 1526.32
there's no direct lead that there's

1523.84 --> 1529.84
actually 33

1526.32 --> 1529.84
of something for real

1530.0 --> 1535.44
right if it seems to have been just

1532.08 --> 1538.3999999999999
picked as a number without any actual

1535.44 --> 1541.039
backup of any sort then it's very likely

1538.4 --> 1543.76
to be a code

1541.039 --> 1546.05
that it's just a crisis act nonsense

1543.76 --> 1549.109
article

1546.05 --> 1549.109
[Music]

1551.44 --> 1556.799
trump could face 33 years in prison yeah

1553.76 --> 1559.84
that sounds like absolute total

1556.799 --> 1562.1589999999999
freemason horseshit

1559.84 --> 1565.1999999999998
like horseshit who comes up with that

1562.159 --> 1568.24
[ __ ] that's an absolute lie

1565.2 --> 1570.96
nobody [ __ ] ever gets sentenced to 33

1568.24 --> 1574.559
years in prison in the [ __ ] history

1570.96 --> 1577.52
of humanity that's never happened it has

1574.559 --> 1578.48
to be ridiculous instant proof right

1577.52 --> 1579.84
there

1578.48 --> 1582.64
instant

1579.84 --> 1586.32
there's no place for the number 33 in

1582.64 --> 1588.72
that sentence makes no sense so you know

1586.32 --> 1592.279
that that's absolute horseshit and it's

1588.72 --> 1592.279
never going to happen

1613.84 --> 1619.84
ukrainian influencer anti-fascist of

1617.36 --> 1624.3999999999999
yeah that's dominoid that's a great

1619.84 --> 1624.3999999999999
example of a highly suspect title

1624.88 --> 1628.5590000000002
like

1625.679 --> 1630.24
why the [ __ ] would you even say he was

1628.559 --> 1632.6399999999999
33 years old

1630.24 --> 1634.159
like that makes no sense it is an

1632.64 --> 1636.96
anti-vaxxer

1634.159 --> 1640.72
total horseshit

1636.96 --> 1645.039
right so it's the context it's always

1640.72 --> 1647.52
the context every time

1645.039 --> 1650.08
always the context not just the number

1647.52 --> 1652.399
it's the context

1650.08 --> 1655.84
that was the point of my art of my title

1652.399 --> 1655.84
for today's show

1670.24 --> 1675.919
yeah and oh by the way youtube likes to

1672.96 --> 1678.159
[ __ ] you over with it on purpose as well

1675.919 --> 1682.3200000000002
because youtube sets

1678.159 --> 1685.2
the amount of likes it caps it at 32 a

1682.32 --> 1687.039
lot so that when you up vote it turns

1685.2 --> 1690.799
into 33.

1687.039 --> 1694.48
dude this has happened like half of

1690.799 --> 1696.6399999999999
every single flat earth debate live show

1694.48 --> 1697.76
that i've ever visited in the last four

1696.64 --> 1702.0
years

1697.76 --> 1704.8799999999999
half of them yeah that's like

1702.0 --> 1707.84
700 episodes

1704.88 --> 1710.72
yeah do you understand that every time

1707.84 --> 1712.6399999999999
every day i go to the flat earth debates

1710.72 --> 1716.3990000000001
and then at the end of the live show i

1712.64 --> 1718.159
went up vote guess what it adds 32

1716.399 --> 1719.36
uploads

1718.159 --> 1721.279
every

1719.36 --> 1724.0
[ __ ] time

1721.279 --> 1725.919
half the shows yeah that's youtube

1724.0 --> 1729.44
literally trying to [ __ ] with you trying

1725.919 --> 1732.96
to make you afraid

1729.44 --> 1735.2
this is a setup see because it's at 32

1732.96 --> 1738.159
votes and if you then upload that means

1735.2 --> 1741.8400000000001
you're contributing to the 33 that means

1738.159 --> 1745.1200000000001
you're a mason slave now this sort of

1741.84 --> 1747.279
game [ __ ] is what youtube also

1745.12 --> 1749.84
unleashes on its public

1747.279 --> 1751.52
through the algorithm on purpose they

1749.84 --> 1752.8799999999999
know what they're doing

1751.52 --> 1756.1589999999999
when they do that

1752.88 --> 1758.0800000000002
it's sneaky it's grably

1756.159 --> 1760.72
and they do it and they've been doing it

1758.08 --> 1760.72
for years

1760.96 --> 1763.3600000000001
years

1764.159 --> 1766.48
do you understand

1765.52 --> 1767.279
half

1766.48 --> 1769.6
the

1767.279 --> 1774.159
live shows half

1769.6 --> 1774.1589999999999
that's like 700 live shows

1777.12 --> 1780.7199999999998
that's not an exaggeration it is so in

1779.44 --> 1783.2
my face

1780.72 --> 1784.96
i just stopped taking note of it it's

1783.2 --> 1787.44
just like yeah [ __ ] you youtube i don't

1784.96 --> 1791.2
give a [ __ ] if it's 32 every single i

1799.52 --> 1804.24
[ __ ] i don't give a [ __ ] for your

click it to make the number turn 33

1833.12 --> 1839.36
every [ __ ] single time i can

1836.88 --> 1839.3600000000001
you get it

1839.52 --> 1843.44
this is code [ __ ]

1843.74 --> 1846.779
[Music]

1847.919 --> 1852.88
it's not about the views it's about the

1850.08 --> 1855.52
upvotes it's the upvote never the views

1852.88 --> 1857.6000000000001
the views are completely

1855.52 --> 1858.72
not related to any of that it's the

1857.6 --> 1860.9599999999998
votes

1858.72 --> 1864.64
well there's the 200

1860.96 --> 1869.2

1910.64 --> 1916.2
possessed especially if you don't know

1912.399 --> 1916.1999999999998

1981.2 --> 1985.1200000000001
that youtube did that standard uh yeah

1983.44 --> 1987.44
you remember it well i remember it too

1985.12 --> 1988.399
it doesn't do that anymore but it did

1987.44 --> 1991.1200000000001
like

1988.399 --> 1993.4399999999998
when the algorithm was not just yet

1991.12 --> 1996.799
fine-tuned to literally remove anything

1993.44 --> 1999.6000000000001
flat earth related from the large scale

1996.799 --> 2002.32
it would do instant fuel limiting

1999.6 --> 2003.6
it would just set it at three 301 that's

2002.32 --> 2007.8799999999999
right

2003.6 --> 2007.8799999999999
it used to do that a lot

2031.519 --> 2035.119
all right

2031.94 --> 2035.1190000000001
[Music]

satanic now so of course they're gonna

2062.079 --> 2064.7200000000003
bring it out

2067.2 --> 2072.96
i mean back in the day

2070.159 --> 2075.599
england had kind of a

2072.96 --> 2077.04
sort of christian perspective thing

2075.599 --> 2080.0
going

2077.04 --> 2082.56
you might have noticed that that is like

2080.0 --> 2084.079
180 degree

2082.56 --> 2086.839
turn around now

2084.079 --> 2090.2400000000002
now england is just breaking

2086.839 --> 2094.879
demonic obsessed with 1984

2090.24 --> 2098.72
satanism luciferianism depopulation

2094.879 --> 2101.72
witchcraft ugliness evil

2137.359 --> 2142.0
never try it ever just don't

2142.32 --> 2146.6400000000003
don't ponder on why

why would this happen why would that

2146.64 --> 2150.3199999999997
happen yeah yeah why when you stick a

2355.28 --> 2359.119
demonically possessed gamma piece of

2357.68 --> 2362.3199999999997

you do it wrong you're outta here

2376.8 --> 2381.3590000000004
it's not about what you do it's about

2378.64 --> 2383.92
the intention it's about your context

2381.359 --> 2386.56
it's about the energy that you carry as

2383.92 --> 2386.56
you enter

2388.16 --> 2393.72
gammas are not welcome here

2416.72 --> 2419.72

2435.52 --> 2439.7599999999998
you johnny serena you're actually a

2437.44 --> 2441.92
person with channel content who would

2439.76 --> 2444.2400000000002
have thought that

2441.92 --> 2446.88
but it's a really bad thing to enter in

2444.24 --> 2449.2799999999997
my chat saying such a thing though

2446.88 --> 2450.2400000000002
humans are a [ __ ] up species

2449.28 --> 2453.8390000000004
yeah

2450.24 --> 2455.5989999999997
but no they're as [ __ ] up as you

2453.839 --> 2458.96
choose to be

2455.599 --> 2461.2000000000003
that's the whole point is the choice

2458.96 --> 2464.2400000000002
if you only [ __ ] with focus on those

2461.2 --> 2467.359
that are weak and choose [ __ ] up being

2464.24 --> 2470.16
[ __ ] up yeah

2467.359 --> 2472.7999999999997
you're gonna stare yourself blind

2470.16 --> 2472.7999999999997
don't do that

2473.44 --> 2478.56
just let them die

2475.359 --> 2484.2
let them choose themselves into oblivion

2478.56 --> 2484.2
and death let them rot in hell

2505.2 --> 2509.5989999999997
all right so johnny serena you're

2507.04 --> 2510.56
actually a real person it seems so it

2509.599 --> 2511.92
seems

2510.56 --> 2514.24
that's cool

2511.92 --> 2518.599
just don't enter the chat for the first

2514.24 --> 2518.5989999999997
time saying something like that

2534.24 --> 2538.3999999999996
wait what sleeping warrior who are you

2536.16 --> 2540.24

2540.24 --> 2543.3999999999996
a baller

2550.319 --> 2555.7599999999998

2553.04 --> 2558.24
trying to learn other right see hello

2555.76 --> 2560.48
yeah sorry for the banning earlier

2558.24 --> 2563.4799999999996
just thought you were one of the trolls

2560.48 --> 2563.48
again

2564.24 --> 2567.52
but yeah welcome to the show

2568.88 --> 2572.0
right

2570.319 --> 2575.599
so

2572.0 --> 2579.48
is this like how did you come

2575.599 --> 2579.48
bump into my channel

2585.44 --> 2591.4
yeah what

2586.64 --> 2591.4
yes i believe what where

2593.839 --> 2599.2799999999997
where did he ask that

2596.8 --> 2599.28
oh wait

2602.079 --> 2607.04
oh yeah he did

2604.319 --> 2609.52
huh

2607.04 --> 2611.52
yeah yeah i i noticed yeah i i

2609.52 --> 2612.319
apparently didn't see that message but

2611.52 --> 2614.24
yeah

2612.319 --> 2615.7599999999998
all right oh hey that's a reasonable

2614.24 --> 2617.7599999999998
question why not

2615.76 --> 2619.599
i mean this is the called the flat earth

2617.76 --> 2621.8390000000004
early bird show

2619.599 --> 2621.839
right

2623.04 --> 2627.04
so yeah it's not a strange question for

2624.88 --> 2628.1600000000003
a newcomer

2627.04 --> 2629.92
right but

2628.16 --> 2632.16
yeah there's no

2629.92 --> 2632.16
look

2633.119 --> 2638.48
there's no real belief about the earth

2635.599 --> 2641.119
being flat it is flat

2638.48 --> 2644.8
it cannot be any other way and the

2641.119 --> 2645.76
entire globe model can be

2644.8 --> 2649.3590000000004
very

2645.76 --> 2651.8390000000004
detailed back engineered and figured out

2649.359 --> 2653.92
how they build it

2651.839 --> 2656.48
and then when you do that you realize

2653.92 --> 2659.76
through the very raw data on which it's

2656.48 --> 2661.839
all based that it was actually derived

2659.76 --> 2664.5600000000004
yeah mathematically

2661.839 --> 2666.48
it from a flat plane

2664.56 --> 2668.0
and that there is no other way that it

2666.48 --> 2670.96
could have been done

2668.0 --> 2674.72
to result in the data that has been used

2670.96 --> 2676.56
in the construction of the globe model

2674.72 --> 2679.56
it's not a belief

2676.56 --> 2681.119
that the earth is flat it is absolutely

2679.56 --> 2684.48
incontrovertible

2681.119 --> 2688.28
true that the earth is flat belief has

2684.48 --> 2688.28
nothing to do with it

2693.2 --> 2696.72
right johnny no it's fine

2697.04 --> 2702.24
things get a little rough in here

2700.4 --> 2705.2400000000002
because of the troll stalkers and all

2702.24 --> 2705.24
that

2707.95 --> 2712.56
[Music]

2709.28 --> 2715.8390000000004
oh sleeping wars doing his

2712.56 --> 2719.839
dog sniffing routine

2715.839 --> 2719.839
immediately onto the new guy

2720.56 --> 2724.64
i believe it's spinning well do you

2721.839 --> 2724.64
believe it's spinning well

2724.88 --> 2730.88
right sleeping

2727.66 --> 2730.8799999999997
[Music]

2735.76 --> 2739.3190000000004
hello someone

2752.319 --> 2757.359
yeah mitchell from australia had some

2754.0 --> 2757.359
really good videos recently

2758.4 --> 2762.56
did michonne go back and do it again

2760.48 --> 2765.04
already what

2762.56 --> 2765.04
i don't know

2769.92 --> 2773.28
i think we're still talking about last

2771.599 --> 2775.6800000000003
summer mitchell had a really good

2773.28 --> 2777.92
youtube go last summer

2775.68 --> 2780.56
all the drone footage and places he

2777.92 --> 2782.96
visited was great

2780.56 --> 2786.52
but yeah during the winter he's kind of

2782.96 --> 2786.52
not done that

2789.2 --> 2792.7999999999997
thanks for taking the time no problem

2794.8 --> 2798.88
it's what i do this is what i this is

2796.48 --> 2798.88
the show

2799.92 --> 2804.56
the real foundation of the show is

2802.64 --> 2806.4
i interact with chat

2804.56 --> 2808.96
i answer questions

2806.4 --> 2810.1600000000003
i address subjects

2808.96 --> 2812.96
i

2810.16 --> 2815.44
testify as to my own personal

2812.96 --> 2817.52
activities and inner thoughts and inner

2815.44 --> 2819.28
struggles making it kind of personal

2817.52 --> 2821.2
like that

2819.28 --> 2823.52
and

2821.2 --> 2823.52
yeah

2825.04 --> 2829.599
it has turned the show sort of into a

2827.68 --> 2832.0
workshop

2829.599 --> 2834.7200000000003
i'm it's like a workshop the chat is the

2832.0 --> 2837.28
workshop it has very strict rules like

2834.72 --> 2839.7599999999998
in a workshop it's not just like a place

2837.28 --> 2842.7200000000003
to hang around you have to

2839.76 --> 2845.44
follow code of conduct you have to be or

2842.72 --> 2847.7599999999998
you have to attempt to be productive

2845.44 --> 2849.599
right when it's productive of trying to

2847.76 --> 2851.8390000000004
restore yourself to becoming more

2849.599 --> 2853.28
productive or it is you are productive

2851.839 --> 2854.96
and you're gonna do

2853.28 --> 2857.3590000000004
something with it

2854.96 --> 2860.4
like figure things out

2857.359 --> 2860.4
help other people

2861.44 --> 2864.96
make them laugh all kinds of ways you

2863.2 --> 2867.68
could do that

2864.96 --> 2869.44
and in the meantime i'm like the chef on

2867.68 --> 2871.5989999999997
the radio

2869.44 --> 2874.7200000000003
that basically has

2871.599 --> 2876.8
a monopoly on the sound

2874.72 --> 2878.7999999999997
which really does make communicating

2876.8 --> 2879.8390000000004
with the chat a lot easier it really

2878.8 --> 2882.1600000000003
does

2879.839 --> 2884.48
because now i can never get rumpus and

2882.16 --> 2886.0
so i can never get annoyed by being

2884.48 --> 2890.079
rumpus

2886.0 --> 2890.079
because it would annoy me a lot

2890.559 --> 2896.559
i have to basically exert a lot of

2893.119 --> 2898.7200000000003
suppression with my annoyance when when

2896.559 --> 2900.48
things get rumpussy

2898.72 --> 2902.64
on the flat earth debate

2900.48 --> 2904.4
and yeah ooh i rump us a little

2902.64 --> 2907.68
sometimes too and then everybody just

2904.4 --> 2907.6800000000003
starts yelling at me

2908.16 --> 2912.96
treating me like i'm new for some reason

2910.96 --> 2914.8
like yesterday show it was annoying and

2912.96 --> 2916.8
it happened so much i don't really give

2914.8 --> 2919.52
a [ __ ] though

2916.8 --> 2921.599
but basically new was rum [ __ ] you

2919.52 --> 2925.359
interrupted like three or four times

2921.599 --> 2925.3590000000004
then i spoke up and said neil

3118.4 --> 3122.559
rolling and rolling and if i even tried

3120.4 --> 3125.2000000000003
to speak i was like oh no no wait are we

maybe he did because he was

3616.0 --> 3619.68
absolutely

3617.839 --> 3621.52
now but he really does it when somebody

3619.68 --> 3622.3999999999996
just makes something personal

3621.52 --> 3625.359
right

3622.4 --> 3627.599
i mean he has sort of a rage win

inside of him too he just

3627.599 --> 3630.559
never lets it out

3635.119 --> 3639.92
he's he's a guy that when he gets that

3637.76 --> 3642.1600000000003
impulse he just knows how to transform

3639.92 --> 3643.52
it into comedy

much quicker

i'm just like no i'm not gonna make a

3650.559 --> 3654.6400000000003

3652.799 --> 3656.96
like hey don't do that

3654.64 --> 3660.16
oh it was in the middle of the show oh

3656.96 --> 3662.16
yes yes well then don't program

3660.16 --> 3665.1189999999997
the middle of your show

3662.16 --> 3666.24

3665.119 --> 3668.48
like that

3666.24 --> 3670.3999999999996
and he'll say nothing about it yeah then

3668.48 --> 3673.44
don't do that

3673.44 --> 3678.799

it's kind of like yeah

3718.96 --> 3722.44
half the time

3726.88 --> 3732.2400000000002
but other days i it's great

3729.92 --> 3734.0

3732.24 --> 3736.5589999999997
freaking deserve and that i can

3734.0 --> 3740.079
definitely say without any shame or

3736.559 --> 3742.1600000000003

3746.319 --> 3749.2799999999997
yeah

3747.68 --> 3751.44

3749.28 --> 3752.4
happens it's just that when it doesn't

3751.44 --> 3755.839
happen

it is quite intolerable

3761.92 --> 3767.119
right if you don't like me in a day

3764.48 --> 3769.2

that's it that's how i feel

3869.68 --> 3873.0389999999998
hey lsg good to see you

3874.079 --> 3878.7200000000003
right so all this ranting is not

3876.4 --> 3881.52
anything specifically related to the

3878.72 --> 3884.7599999999998
show yesterday show yesterday was fine

3881.52 --> 3887.28
except for one moment where nathan just

3884.76 --> 3889.8390000000004
re-categorized me

3887.28 --> 3892.2400000000002
with neil even though i was literally

3889.839 --> 3894.16
only saying neil

3892.24 --> 3896.4799999999996
to make him shut up and that's the only

3894.16 --> 3899.24
time i did that while he interrupted

3896.48 --> 3902.2400000000002
like four times in a row and then nathan

3899.24 --> 3905.839
re-categorizes me like i'm rumpusing and

3902.24 --> 3908.16
i will not have it i will not have it

3905.839 --> 3910.96
don't do that i'm trying to keep order

3908.16 --> 3913.92
for your [ __ ] show nathan

3910.96 --> 3916.079
i'm not trying to rumpus

3913.92 --> 3919.6800000000003
if you're grinding down

3916.079 --> 3922.319
on an etherean or an anti-flat earther i

3919.68 --> 3924.64
know how it works i'm not gonna try to

3922.319 --> 3927.52
interrupt it neil does that sometimes i

3924.64 --> 3930.0789999999997
don't i might laugh

3927.52 --> 3932.16
at a well-timed moment to add to the

3930.079 --> 3934.2400000000002
dramatic effects

3932.16 --> 3936.64
that's it

3934.24 --> 3939.1189999999997
you know that's what i do

3936.64 --> 3942.4
and i do my best to do it well

3939.119 --> 3944.88
to add to the enjoyability

3942.4 --> 3947.28
of listening to the show

3944.88 --> 3949.76
so don't categorize me

3947.28 --> 3953.599
with a rom-passing meal

3949.76 --> 3956.0
when i try to assist you in your show

3953.599 --> 3957.44
thank you very much

3956.0 --> 3961.4
right i'm going to take a five two

type something and then you retract it

4200.239 --> 4205.5199999999995
oh we can't click it yeah

4202.48 --> 4208.08
but if we ban you

4205.52 --> 4210.159000000001
then we can still see the message you

4208.08 --> 4211.679
wrote even though you retracted it you

4210.159 --> 4214.96
[ __ ]

4211.679 --> 4217.84
doesn't work you get it [ __ ] face

4214.96 --> 4217.84
it doesn't work

4218.08 --> 4222.36
you can't hide your [ __ ]

4223.67 --> 4233.76
[Music]

4230.32 --> 4233.759999999999
32 in people in chat

4234.56 --> 4239.2390000000005
and

4235.36 --> 4239.239
are half of them trolls

4244.159 --> 4248.96
i'm not seeing 32 people in my chat

4249.84 --> 4253.32
but oh well

4258.0 --> 4261.6
least my camera is not freezing

4262.239 --> 4265.239
today

4272.719 --> 4276.8
oh

4273.92 --> 4281.56
watching 33 watching right yeah that's

4276.8 --> 4281.56
not in chat though lighter sage

4300.78 --> 4304.239
[Music]

4302.32 --> 4306.719
all right

4304.239 --> 4309.599999999999
anyhow mostly just need to get that off

4306.719 --> 4311.84
my chest i mean it's been heaping up for

4309.6 --> 4313.4400000000005
like weeks

4311.84 --> 4316.56
because i can't

4313.44 --> 4318.5599999999995
just afford to get angry about it every

4316.56 --> 4320.8
freaking week

4318.56 --> 4322.320000000001
because something like that happens

4320.8 --> 4327.04
every week

4322.32 --> 4327.04
every week for the last four years now

4327.28 --> 4331.84
mostly every week

4329.04 --> 4335.6
every last two years before that things

4331.84 --> 4335.6
were different setting entirely

4338.56 --> 4344.64
there was other types of hassle

4340.719 --> 4344.64
like in the ranty days and all that

4354.08 --> 4358.8
you think that's fascinating

4356.719 --> 4360.8
really rick peck i think it's like

4358.8 --> 4362.8
annoying

4360.8 --> 4365.4400000000005
it just goes to show that some people

4362.8 --> 4367.52
are just unbelievable and repenting

4365.44 --> 4369.678999999999
retards

4367.52 --> 4370.719
like they're not gonna learn they would

4369.679 --> 4373.679
probably

4370.719 --> 4376.32
literally get themselves killed

4373.679 --> 4377.679
before they actually would be able to

4376.32 --> 4380.5599999999995
move on

4377.679 --> 4384.84
with any intellectual detail about

4380.56 --> 4384.84
anything because they're pathetic

4385.44 --> 4389.199
and they never got any good upbringing

4387.7 --> 4390.96
[Music]

4389.199 --> 4392.639999999999
parents never taught them that you

4390.96 --> 4395.64
always have to keep moving keep

4392.64 --> 4395.64
developing

4410.8 --> 4413.84
oh jarvis

4443.12 --> 4449.28
okay neil degrasse tyson lies

4446.56 --> 4452.2390000000005
33 linked to bp you don't know what that

4449.28 --> 4452.239
means woohoo

4453.44 --> 4457.159
hey level bastard

4481.36 --> 4488.639999999999
wait really jarvis you're still a glober

4486.08 --> 4488.64
wow

4490.0 --> 4493.0
really

4511.28 --> 4515.5199999999995
me and billions of others yeah

4513.679 --> 4518.32
you know how many billions of others

4515.52 --> 4520.0
have just in the last two year

4518.32 --> 4522.32
been convinced

4520.0 --> 4526.0
by just speaking points in governments

4522.32 --> 4528.96
without actual evidence to literally

4526.0 --> 4529.92
put in in experimental poison in their

4528.96 --> 4532.32
body

4529.92 --> 4534.56
to get atrocious

4532.32 --> 4537.84
diseases and die

4534.56 --> 4539.679
yeah that's those other 8 billion people

4537.84 --> 4542.32
you're talking about you really want to

4539.679 --> 4544.159
categorize yourself with those other 8

4542.32 --> 4546.48
billion [ __ ] retards that would

4544.159 --> 4549.199
literally get themselves killed because

4546.48 --> 4551.5199999999995
of some stupid roll out speaking point

4549.199 --> 4553.5199999999995
to inject yourself with poison

4551.52 --> 4555.84
against something that literally doesn't

4553.52 --> 4557.52
exist and isn't even claimed to be

4555.84 --> 4559.679
[ __ ] dangerous you're gonna

4557.52 --> 4563.1990000000005
categorize yourself with those other

4559.679 --> 4564.8
eight billion people jarvis really

4563.199 --> 4568.239
really

4564.8 --> 4568.2390000000005
think about what you're saying there

4568.32 --> 4572.5599999999995
that's that's quite a low standard you

4570.48 --> 4575.5599999999995
set for yourself there

4572.56 --> 4575.56
jesus

4595.679 --> 4598.2390000000005
that's right

4603.36 --> 4609.239
ball i don't care if he is

4605.52 --> 4609.2390000000005
he's been pretty cool

4612.4 --> 4616.879999999999
like as long as he just doesn't whine

4614.239 --> 4619.678999999999
about nonsense and doesn't

4616.88 --> 4622.56
spout out anti-flat earther conditioning

4619.679 --> 4626.08
it's just fine with me if he's he

4622.56 --> 4626.080000000001
if he has a wrench in my chat

4626.32 --> 4633.12
i mean not everything we talk about on

4628.4 --> 4633.12
this show is about flat earth contrary

4633.52 --> 4639.76
hey drunken bullet four one one

4637.679 --> 4643.4800000000005
wow

4639.76 --> 4643.4800000000005
i got a full chat

4662.159 --> 4668.5599999999995
right so it's still raining it has been

4665.04 --> 4668.56
raining for the last half hour

4676.32 --> 4681.759999999999
i i can't complain plants are really

4679.36 --> 4685.4
liking this so

4681.76 --> 4685.400000000001
i'm happy for them

4701.28 --> 4704.96
is there a number enough

4705.28 --> 4711.199
that's really hard level bastard to

4708.719 --> 4713.36
really figure out the exact number

4711.199 --> 4715.36
because there's all kinds of screwing

4713.36 --> 4716.239
around with statistics all over the

4715.36 --> 4718.0
place

4716.239 --> 4720.239
so yeah

4718.0 --> 4721.84
it's not that might not be as easy as

4720.239 --> 4724.5599999999995
you might think it is

4721.84 --> 4726.08
to get a straightforward number on that

4724.56 --> 4728.88
because there's

4726.08 --> 4731.199
lots of placebos

4728.88 --> 4733.52
like saline shots

4731.199 --> 4735.28
and there's people that

4733.52 --> 4738.080000000001
we got one in the chat even that

4735.28 --> 4740.0
literally falsified their injection

4738.08 --> 4740.96
status and all that so

4740.0 --> 4742.48
dude

4740.96 --> 4745.679
how are you gonna track that with the

4742.48 --> 4747.599999999999
whole world man that's dude

4745.679 --> 4751.04
that might take another decade before

4747.6 --> 4755.159000000001
that's even figured out who exactly

4751.04 --> 4755.159
did actually take it

4755.57 --> 4758.71
[Music]

4766.0 --> 4771.6
every single you don't know what science

4768.159 --> 4775.799999999999
is jarvis you're just spouting standard

4771.6 --> 4775.8
rhetoric [ __ ] now

4777.199 --> 4781.199
yeah

4778.4 --> 4782.0
there's no scientist that's gonna tell

4781.199 --> 4785.199
you

4782.0 --> 4786.88
that they concluded through science that

4785.199 --> 4790.5599999999995
it's a globe

4786.88 --> 4793.36
that's mechanically impossible like

4790.56 --> 4797.120000000001
literally the scientific method cannot

4793.36 --> 4800.639999999999
be utilized to do that it's stupid

4797.12 --> 4802.84
it's nonsense it's science culture

4800.64 --> 4806.08
has been slipped under your

4802.84 --> 4809.92
nose and you don't even know it

4806.08 --> 4811.92
that this science science is not science

4809.92 --> 4814.639
at all not even close

4811.92 --> 4816.639
it's a culture it's a culture of you can

4814.639 --> 4819.679
be science too

4816.639 --> 4820.96
total horseshit total lie

4819.679 --> 4823.4400000000005
it's not true

4820.96 --> 4825.199
yeah you can test things you can figure

4823.44 --> 4828.96
out what is has nothing to do with

4825.199 --> 4831.04
science though absolutely not

4828.96 --> 4833.36
and doesn't make everything science

4831.04 --> 4835.04
either that's all mind control

4833.36 --> 4837.44
brainwashing

4835.04 --> 4839.44
to turn you into a weak-minded [ __ ]

4837.44 --> 4841.919999999999
that doesn't pay a lot of attention it's

4839.44 --> 4844.0
very easily convinced about how things

4841.92 --> 4846.639
are by people that don't actually prove

4844.0 --> 4848.8
it to you they just put on a lab coat

4846.639 --> 4850.56
show their little paper

4848.8 --> 4852.4800000000005
and then you believe it because you're a

4850.56 --> 4854.96
[ __ ] and you're conditioned and

4852.48 --> 4859.799999999999
programmed to be a [ __ ] yeah

4854.96 --> 4859.8
has nothing to do with science at all

4868.48 --> 4874.799999999999
who gets a fleeting [ __ ] if a scientist

4872.8 --> 4877.76
tells you the earth is flat

4874.8 --> 4878.88
what the hell does a freaking opinion

4877.76 --> 4881.280000000001
matter

4878.88 --> 4883.52
to what really is

4881.28 --> 4886.719
who gives a [ __ ]

4883.52 --> 4889.040000000001
if all science scientists

4886.719 --> 4890.32
or any scientist an actual scientist

4889.04 --> 4892.4
that actually understands the

4890.32 --> 4895.28
predicament that the scientific

4892.4 --> 4896.96
community has been in for the last

4895.28 --> 4898.96
century

4896.96 --> 4900.88
who gives a [ __ ]

4898.96 --> 4902.4800000000005
if they say

4900.88 --> 4906.56
what the earth is

4902.48 --> 4906.5599999999995
has nothing to do with anything

4908.239 --> 4913.678999999999
yeah you're treating science like it is

4911.36 --> 4915.12
a priesthood like it is the new

4913.679 --> 4917.84
catholicism

4915.12 --> 4917.84
this is ridiculous

4918.239 --> 4924.638999999999
science is a method it's a decentralized

4921.28 --> 4925.5199999999995
rigid method that anybody should be able

4924.639 --> 4926.8
to

4925.52 --> 4929.4400000000005
apply

4926.8 --> 4931.679
and then test anything

4929.44 --> 4934.32
that actually follows the scientific

4931.679 --> 4937.04
method to see whether it is true or not

4934.32 --> 4940.239
whether it's actually gonna do

4937.04 --> 4942.96
the thing suggested that it would do

4940.239 --> 4946.48
yeah that's science

4942.96 --> 4949.199
what a scientist somebody who allegedly

4946.48 --> 4952.638999999999
performed a scientific experiment

4949.199 --> 4955.5199999999995
what they say has absolutely no [ __ ]

4952.639 --> 4958.0
relevance to anything

4955.52 --> 4960.2390000000005
what the hell does it matter what they

4958.0 --> 4960.239
say

4963.6 --> 4969.6
no they won't figure it out

4966.239 --> 4971.678999999999
you don't seem to understand at all

4969.6 --> 4973.76
what they do

4971.679 --> 4976.56
yeah what they do

4973.76 --> 4979.360000000001
is being a brain on a stick

4976.56 --> 4982.4800000000005
being a claimed intellect that will

4979.36 --> 4985.04
solve the theoretical problems so they

4982.48 --> 4986.5599999999995
do a bunch of calculations according to

4985.04 --> 4989.44
the graphs that were

4986.56 --> 4991.4400000000005
available to me based on endless amounts

4989.44 --> 4994.0
of presuppositions and bunch of [ __ ]

4991.44 --> 4994.0
politics

4994.159 --> 4997.599999999999
and then we draw the conclusion through

4996.08 --> 4999.92
the graphs

4997.6 --> 5002.639
that this and this has to be this is the

4999.92 --> 5005.6
way it is yeah

5002.639 --> 5007.12
dude has nothing to do with science

5005.6 --> 5009.1990000000005
nothing

5007.12 --> 5010.88
nothing

5009.199 --> 5013.12
science

5010.88 --> 5015.12
is a method

5013.12 --> 5018.8
to test

5015.12 --> 5020.639
the cause of an effect

5018.8 --> 5023.6
the effect has to be

5020.639 --> 5026.08
independent you have to be able to

5023.6 --> 5029.280000000001
vary and manipulate it independently as

5026.08 --> 5032.48
the experimenter to actually see

5029.28 --> 5034.32
if it will cause the effect

5032.48 --> 5036.879999999999
that you think it does

5034.32 --> 5039.36
within the hypothesis

5036.88 --> 5040.88
and then either it does or it doesn't

5039.36 --> 5043.36
and you have a result you have a

5040.88 --> 5045.28
scientific result a null result or a

5043.36 --> 5049.28
positive result

5045.28 --> 5051.12
that's science that is the only thing

5049.28 --> 5054.84
that science is

5051.12 --> 5057.679
nothing else besides that description is

5054.84 --> 5059.1990000000005
science nothing else

5057.679 --> 5061.84
despite the

5059.199 --> 5064.4
billions and billions of cultural

5061.84 --> 5066.719
association but just thrown on the heap

5064.4 --> 5069.92
oh this person knows something he's a

5066.719 --> 5072.32
scientist no he's not has nothing to do

5069.92 --> 5072.32
with it

5072.4 --> 5075.599999999999
nothing to do with it

5075.679 --> 5079.12
knowing stuff does not make you a

scientist

5079.12 --> 5084.4
performing a

5081.679 --> 5087.52
scientific experiment

5084.4 --> 5089.599999999999
makes you a scientist yeah

5087.52 --> 5092.400000000001
i don't even know

5089.6 --> 5095.6
any scientist that has performed a

scientific experiment out there in my

5095.6 --> 5100.639
entire life

5098.32 --> 5100.639
yeah

5100.719 --> 5102.96
none

5103.36 --> 5105.599999999999
none

5105.92 --> 5109.84
most scientists don't even know what it

5109.12 --> 5111.12
is

5109.84 --> 5113.52
that they are

5111.12 --> 5115.679
they think there's something they don't

5113.52 --> 5117.280000000001
even know what it is

5115.679 --> 5120.0
because they don't need that because

5117.28 --> 5122.48
it's a sham it's not a scientist it's a

they're for they're priests

5138.96 --> 5142.96

5164.719 --> 5171.44
what is with science you can only prove

5167.52 --> 5174.639
what causes with science not what is

5171.44 --> 5176.799999999999
you can never prove the earth is a ball

with science you can never prove the

you can never prove

anything

what causes questions their what is

questions and what is questions are not

5195.04 --> 5197.84
science

5226.159 --> 5229.92
right we just seen it yeah biological

5228.4 --> 5232.5599999999995
fact you can

5229.92 --> 5235.12
invoke facts

5232.56 --> 5237.360000000001
right this is a fact this is what is see

5235.12 --> 5239.679
this is what it turns out to be every

5237.36 --> 5241.92
time yeah you can do that

5239.679 --> 5248.12
it's not science

5241.92 --> 5248.12
it's just what is establishing what is

5251.45 --> 5254.679999999999
[Music]

5256.639 --> 5262.719
oh well jarvis why straw man us then why

5260.4 --> 5266.4
straw man us

5262.719 --> 5268.08
about that we demand scientific proof

5266.4 --> 5270.719
for the globe

5268.08 --> 5270.719
we don't

5271.76 --> 5276.159000000001
or i don't maybe some flat earthers out

5274.32 --> 5279.12
there still say that because they're

5276.159 --> 5280.799999999999
still riding on the very old by now

5279.12 --> 5282.239
discovered fact

5280.8 --> 5285.6
that the scientific method has been

5282.239 --> 5287.199
taken completely out of whack

5285.6 --> 5288.96
and people don't even know what it is

5287.199 --> 5292.4
anymore

5288.96 --> 5294.56
yeah and then because in 2015 ballers

5292.4 --> 5295.92
would start to yawn

5294.56 --> 5297.04
whine

5295.92 --> 5299.36
constantly

5297.04 --> 5302.96
we have science science proves the globe

5299.36 --> 5306.719
yeah the ballers said science proves the

5302.96 --> 5309.76
globe we don't say that and we don't say

5306.719 --> 5311.12
science proves the flat earth either

5309.76 --> 5313.6
yeah

5311.12 --> 5315.199
it is a straw man jarvis it is a straw

5313.6 --> 5318.0
man

5315.199 --> 5320.719
that you said that we

5318.0 --> 5322.88
demand that the globe must be proven by

5320.719 --> 5325.6
the scientific method that is a straw

5322.88 --> 5328.159000000001
man because we don't say that

5325.6 --> 5331.120000000001
it is a straw man you're literally

5328.159 --> 5333.679
telling us what we're doing that's wrong

5331.12 --> 5336.48
when we don't do that literally we don't

5333.679 --> 5339.88
and i just explained that yeah it is a

5336.48 --> 5339.879999999999
straw man

sorry to yourself you dumbass it is true

5357.52 --> 5360.8
and you're having a cognitive break

5359.28 --> 5363.36
obviously

5360.8 --> 5366.320000000001
that response is a strong indication of

5363.36 --> 5366.32
a cognitive break

5369.76 --> 5374.56
yeah that's right it's not true

5372.4 --> 5378.4
i mean seriously play

5374.56 --> 5379.76

that's a clear-cut example of it right

5382.08 --> 5386.4
there

5383.199 --> 5386.4
what jarvis just said

5390.6 --> 5395.6
yeah science is not your father

5397.12 --> 5402.08
flat earth is your father

5400.88 --> 5402.88
no

5402.08 --> 5406.159
no

5402.88 --> 5408.400000000001
that's not true

5406.159 --> 5410.879999999999
i know enough about my father

5408.4 --> 5412.239
he told me that the flat earth killed

5410.88 --> 5416.08
the science

5412.239 --> 5419.678999999999
you killed him no no no no

flat earth is your father

no

5421.04 --> 5423.6
no

5422.0 --> 5426.719

5430.239 --> 5437.28
it is true literally

literally in a metaphorical sense it is

5440.32 --> 5442.88
true

5441.36 --> 5444.639
it is true

5442.88 --> 5446.639
if the earth wasn't flat the globe

5444.639 --> 5450.08
marvel could have never been made

5446.639 --> 5452.56
flat earth is literally

5450.08 --> 5454.719
the globe's father

5452.56 --> 5457.120000000001
luke skywalker being the globe darth

5454.719 --> 5459.44
vader being flat earth

5457.12 --> 5461.679
and he thought they were enemies

5459.44 --> 5462.879999999999
it's literally that

5461.679 --> 5465.12
literally

5462.88 --> 5466.639
in a metaphorical sense you have to keep

5465.12 --> 5467.599999999999
saying that because it's not of course

5466.639 --> 5471.52
literally

5467.6 --> 5471.52
literally true that's silly but

5474.96 --> 5480.88
isn't it incredible rig back

5477.04 --> 5482.56
it is that it is exactly that

5480.88 --> 5484.96
i mean you could literally take that

5482.56 --> 5487.280000000001
star famous star wars scene

5484.96 --> 5489.28
and just put a globe over luke

skywalker's face

5489.28 --> 5494.5599999999995
and a flat earth stupid doe model

5492.56 --> 5496.4800000000005
on darth vader's head

5494.56 --> 5499.6
and it would be

5496.48 --> 5502.08
totally on target

5499.6 --> 5502.08
totally

5503.52 --> 5505.84
right

5508.08 --> 5512.639
right and you know

5509.679 --> 5514.32
you know that in the end

5512.639 --> 5516.56
after the emperor is just going to

5514.32 --> 5519.12
destroy everything after the emperor

5516.56 --> 5520.4800000000005
decides to just start roasting the globe

5519.12 --> 5523.28
and destroy it

5520.48 --> 5525.36
that flat earth

5523.28 --> 5527.759999999999
will change its mind

5525.36 --> 5530.08
and basically even

5527.76 --> 5533.84
like risk its own life

thank you very much

6377.36 --> 6381.44
thank you very much indeed very helpful

6381.92 --> 6387.2390000000005
it's gonna be a good rest of the month

6391.52 --> 6397.96
no worries about food

6394.48 --> 6397.959999999999
this is awesome

6406.88 --> 6411.28
yeah of course arena kawambu i i'm glad

6409.6 --> 6413.280000000001
you appreciate that but it's also

6411.28 --> 6414.88
extremely necessary

6413.28 --> 6416.48
because

6414.88 --> 6418.639
if you're just gonna

6416.48 --> 6420.5599999999995
be political about it like oh you're a

6418.639 --> 6422.56
flat earther right okay so that means

6420.56 --> 6424.320000000001
i'm not gonna criticize you i'm not just

6422.56 --> 6426.639
gonna let you do whatever the hell you

6424.32 --> 6428.5599999999995
want you're gonna end up with a lot of

6426.639 --> 6430.0
flat earther lunatics

6428.56 --> 6432.639
that are all

6430.0 --> 6434.239
maniacal think they know everything they

6432.639 --> 6436.400000000001
don't check anything and they will be

6434.239 --> 6438.4
lying

6436.4 --> 6440.0
because

6438.4 --> 6442.0
because of that

6440.0 --> 6444.8
so of course i got to be critical with

6442.0 --> 6446.719
flat earthers probably even more so than

6444.8 --> 6448.719
with ballers why

6446.719 --> 6451.36
because i have more confidence that they

6448.719 --> 6453.84
will be able to actually learn from it

6451.36 --> 6456.5599999999995
and overcome their mistakes

6453.84 --> 6458.32
because they are flat earthers i will

6456.56 --> 6461.04
criticize them more

6458.32 --> 6464.679
because i think it will be more helpful

6461.04 --> 6464.679
compared to bowlers

6471.36 --> 6474.88
oh god

6473.6 --> 6477.04
