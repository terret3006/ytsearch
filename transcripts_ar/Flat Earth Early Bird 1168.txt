117.2 --> 119.60000000000001
change

121.52 --> 125.84
it's just a couple of fluffy clouds

123.92 --> 129.039
clear blue sky

125.84 --> 131.92000000000002
no trails this time

129.039 --> 136.11999999999998
and a nice sun

131.92 --> 136.11999999999998
actually quite a beautiful day

148.959 --> 151.959
um

158.0 --> 162.16
right

159.36 --> 164.56
hello stone monkey first in chat that

162.16 --> 168.16
flat fellow gadget inspector flatter

164.56 --> 171.36
sage porter's boy good to see you all

168.16 --> 174.35999999999999
it is saturday the 26th of february

171.36 --> 174.36
2022.

174.959 --> 177.44
okay

178.0 --> 183.84
and yeah i feel again a bit better than

181.2 --> 187.11999999999998
yesterday although it's still

183.84 --> 187.12
still has some issues

187.36 --> 192.87900000000002
and i'm cutting down a bit on my beer

190.72 --> 194.959
because i am noticing that

192.879 --> 198.28
that is actually a negative influence in

194.959 --> 198.28
this moment

198.72 --> 204.159
um yeah what bothers me so

202.56 --> 206.08
i literally like

204.159 --> 208.72
basically tested because every time i'm

206.08 --> 211.92000000000002
always testing it right

208.72 --> 214.959
my entire being is like a big medical

211.92 --> 214.95899999999997
experiment to me

216.0 --> 218.64
not

217.04 --> 220.64
out of control

218.64 --> 222.55999999999997
medical experiment

220.64 --> 224.879
so yeah if something bothers me i'll

222.56 --> 226.799
just keep testing like what is this an

224.879 --> 229.92
influence on that is that an influence

226.799 --> 232.56
on that of course i do drink beers

229.92 --> 234.0
i was limited and hey that time i got

232.56 --> 239.4
really sick

234.0 --> 239.4
it's i didn't limit myself then it was

241.76 --> 245.51899999999998
so yeah yesterday

243.92 --> 246.79899999999998
drank less

245.519 --> 248.72
and

246.799 --> 250.56
yeah i noticed immediately in the

248.72 --> 252.959
evening that

250.56 --> 254.56
i was still having some issues

252.959 --> 255.84
still bit like

254.56 --> 257.44
tense

255.84 --> 259.519
sort of painful

257.44 --> 261.28
but not like totally attention

259.519 --> 262.88
distorting painful

261.28 --> 264.15999999999997
but it was less

262.88 --> 265.36
so

264.16 --> 267.44
yeah i'm

265.36 --> 269.28000000000003
cutting it down and i think that that

267.44 --> 273.52
should probably

269.28 --> 273.52
i don't know help the situation restore

276.96 --> 280.88
did i speak to my healer about restate

279.199 --> 282.8
no

280.88 --> 284.96
no i actually missed a call of his he

282.8 --> 286.32
did actually check me but he just left a

284.96 --> 289.75899999999996
message

286.32 --> 289.759
so i didn't really talk to him

291.919 --> 297.68
but yeah not using the d3 i don't think

294.96 --> 299.52
that's causing that specific problem

297.68 --> 302.96
or if anything

299.52 --> 306.08
it was kind of preventing

302.96 --> 308.32
in german or medicine explanation

306.08 --> 309.68
it was preventing a

308.32 --> 312.15999999999997
conflict

309.68 --> 315.199
from getting to the

312.16 --> 318.40000000000003
to the healing stage

315.199 --> 320.8
so that thing that was nagging on me was

318.4 --> 323.59999999999997
probably sitting there waiting to

320.8 --> 326.8
finally happen

323.6 --> 330.24
and not taking the d3 actually enable it

326.8 --> 330.24
to get to that stage

333.36 --> 339.36
so i'm not like noticing like oh god i

336.72 --> 342.0
feel so

339.36 --> 344.96000000000004
depressed or oh not enough light i'm

342.0 --> 346.56
actually now also seeking out the light

344.96 --> 349.12
more

346.56 --> 349.12
in a way

350.479 --> 356.15999999999997
so every time i do see like sunlight i'm

352.479 --> 356.15999999999997
really like oh i want to sit in that

357.28 --> 361.59999999999997
but yeah part of the reason also why i

359.759 --> 363.36
stopped taking it

361.6 --> 365.12
was that

363.36 --> 367.12
your body should be able to naturally

365.12 --> 370.08
produce that

367.12 --> 373.44
and if you're constantly taking

370.08 --> 376.0
like supplements of it from the outside

373.44 --> 379.36
that might actually distort your body in

376.0 --> 382.24
its ability to naturally produce it

379.36 --> 382.24
might wear on you

388.24 --> 391.919
turned your face to like yeah now you

390.4 --> 394.08
can't help it

391.919 --> 396.08
like even right now i'm actually like

394.08 --> 398.4
yeah i like it i feel good i want to do

396.08 --> 400.88
this show but i actually also just want

398.4 --> 405.4
to sit outside in the sun at the same

400.88 --> 405.4
time i'm actually thinking about that

411.199 --> 417.039
right but i did go out for groceries

414.16 --> 419.68
and it was enjoyable also

417.039 --> 421.039
some good news i guess

419.68 --> 423.599
apparently

421.039 --> 425.28
like the dutch mask mandate was now

423.599 --> 427.68
officially lifted

425.28 --> 429.75899999999996
so suddenly everybody in my supermarket

427.68 --> 431.36
wasn't wearing a mask

429.759 --> 432.47900000000004
i was like oh

431.36 --> 435.44
huh

432.479 --> 438.08
and then i looked outside

435.44 --> 440.96
and actually i just saw like two people

438.08 --> 443.52
like two old people wearing a mask in

440.96 --> 445.52
total and that's it from the hundreds

443.52 --> 447.919
and hundreds of people i was basically

445.52 --> 450.639
looking at as i was

447.919 --> 452.639
bicycling through that

450.639 --> 454.56
busy

452.639 --> 456.319
street

454.56 --> 459.599
it's kind of like a sort of shopping

456.319 --> 464.28000000000003
street central shopping street thing

459.599 --> 464.28
and yeah nobody was wearing one so

464.479 --> 468.71999999999997
i guess dutch people are just really

467.28 --> 470.96
obedient

468.72 --> 473.59900000000005
because they had been wearing that

470.96 --> 475.75899999999996
for quite a while

473.599 --> 476.71999999999997
a lot of them as i've been complaining

475.759 --> 478.639
about

476.72 --> 480.639
just because they were told to

478.639 --> 483.199
despite the data so i get the feeling

480.639 --> 485.919
that everybody's just really

483.199 --> 487.599
obedient like whether they like it or

485.919 --> 489.52
not whether they agree with it or not

487.599 --> 491.599
they'll still do that

489.52 --> 493.28
and now nobody is

491.599 --> 496.4
but yeah it was nice it was nice to

493.28 --> 499.67999999999995
basically see people's

496.4 --> 501.84
mouth smoothing moving again as i was

499.68 --> 505.24
talking with them

501.84 --> 505.23999999999995
that was great

515.919 --> 519.0
all right

525.36 --> 529.839
right so yesterday's flat earth debate

527.2 --> 529.839
was pretty good

530.48 --> 535.36
i was very active

533.44 --> 538.5600000000001
in the after show i got into pretty

535.36 --> 540.72
rough bumping with 10th man who was well

538.56 --> 542.8
for a better lack of terms

540.72 --> 544.72
bullying me

542.8 --> 546.0799999999999
and that really got to me and i was

544.72 --> 548.88
basically

546.08 --> 550.9590000000001
going in to shut the hell up old man and

548.88 --> 552.959
all that and again because he was just

550.959 --> 555.1199999999999
like i was trying to bring up something

552.959 --> 557.68
that i bumped into

555.12 --> 559.36
and he basically started rumpusing me

557.68 --> 561.519
because he didn't thought it was

559.36 --> 564.64
interesting and it was like what the

561.519 --> 564.64
[ __ ] are you doing

568.32 --> 573.12
right and nathan didn't really intervene

570.48 --> 575.279
so i actually used the opportunity to

573.12 --> 577.76
address him as ones like why are you

575.279 --> 581.279
allowing tent man to do that

577.76 --> 581.279
like that's really rude

582.959 --> 587.279
but anyway i don't know if he kept it in

584.64 --> 589.519
there it was not really a good thing for

587.279 --> 591.4399999999999
in the flatter debates but yeah

589.519 --> 593.519
[ __ ] it you know i'm not gonna be

591.44 --> 597.12
watched over like that

593.519 --> 600.08
so better to ruin it completely

597.12 --> 602.079
than to just have a a thing that nathan

600.08 --> 603.36
might actually put in

602.079 --> 606.2399999999999
the premiere

603.36 --> 610.399
about how i'm basically being bullied

606.24 --> 610.399
because my subject's not interesting

611.6 --> 617.0400000000001
right so yeah

614.56 --> 619.92
but yeah at least they noticed

617.04 --> 622.24
and we did actually after that

619.92 --> 624.56
situation was over

622.24 --> 628.24
we still had like a pretty great hangout

624.56 --> 628.2399999999999
together all of us so

629.92 --> 635.12
and very long by the way man it lasted

633.04 --> 637.1999999999999
very long

635.12 --> 639.44
so it was like a four hour show this

637.2 --> 639.44
time

644.24 --> 649.6
hey matthew hall

647.2 --> 649.6
clutch

652.56 --> 656.04
how are you doing

668.8 --> 671.8
right

682.88 --> 687.36
all right yes then infowars is kind of a

685.279 --> 689.279
funny skit

687.36 --> 692.88
with milo

689.279 --> 692.88
on with the owen troyer

693.519 --> 697.76
and yeah just

695.279 --> 700.0
goofing around but it's fun

697.76 --> 700.0
like

700.959 --> 704.8
milo is quite a weird character

710.079 --> 715.56
uh

711.519 --> 715.5600000000001
hey professor phil bell

723.68 --> 726.68
hmm

733.519 --> 738.0
any reflections on my show from

735.44 --> 738.0
yesterday

739.519 --> 743.639
i thought it was a pretty good show

758.079 --> 762.8
all right apparently rt is getting a lot

760.32 --> 766.48
of ddos attacks

762.8 --> 770.04
because it is down periodically

766.48 --> 770.04
noticing that

788.639 --> 793.04
situation is

790.56 --> 793.04
growing

793.2 --> 797.76
i like i thought actually that

795.2 --> 800.1600000000001
everything would be over much quicker

797.76 --> 802.8
with the ukraine situation

800.16 --> 803.68
but apparently it's like taking longer

802.8 --> 806.8
and

803.68 --> 809.8389999999999
it's already signs signs no proof but

806.8 --> 812.24
signs from just glimpses of infowars and

809.839 --> 813.6800000000001
all that that indeed like old footage is

812.24 --> 816.0
being used

813.68 --> 818.399
and presented as if it is new it's a

816.0 --> 820.8
little trick

818.399 --> 823.6
they like to play sometimes infowars has

820.8 --> 825.04
done that in the past i'm gonna point it

823.6 --> 827.44
out like

825.04 --> 831.12
i'm going to be that thorn in your eye

827.44 --> 831.12
and point that out like yeah

831.6 --> 837.279
i'm pretty certain you are applying

834.0 --> 837.279
propaganda now

838.16 --> 840.56
holding a

839.36 --> 842.5600000000001
a spell

840.56 --> 845.8389999999999
there

842.56 --> 845.8389999999999
don't think i don't notice

854.32 --> 858.48
try to explain the ukraine situation

856.48 --> 861.1990000000001
with my manager

858.48 --> 862.32
yeah but the fair porn dude the fair

861.199 --> 864.8
porn

862.32 --> 866.399
to like putin you gotta realize that

864.8 --> 868.3199999999999
that [ __ ]

866.399 --> 870.32
has been building

868.32 --> 872.88
for like

870.32 --> 876.32
20 years

872.88 --> 877.12
right on media on mainstream news that's

876.32 --> 879.279
been

877.12 --> 881.839
building longer

879.279 --> 884.399
than we all even realized that the media

881.839 --> 886.48
is completely irredeemable and out of

884.399 --> 887.519
control

886.48 --> 889.6800000000001
right

887.519 --> 892.88
they've been doing it programming that

889.68 --> 894.2399999999999
even before most of us realized what it

892.88 --> 895.6
really is

894.24 --> 897.6800000000001
right

895.6 --> 900.399
so yeah it's not surprising that most

897.68 --> 903.4399999999999
people are just immediately like click

900.399 --> 904.639
and they're just gonna what the

903.44 --> 908.839
dude

904.639 --> 908.839
what the [ __ ] is doing that

916.959 --> 923.079
seriously dude

919.12 --> 923.079
get a [ __ ] life

932.32 --> 938.24
yeah no [ __ ] it wasn't you it's some

934.639 --> 940.72
it's that piece of [ __ ] troll again

938.24 --> 943.279
just leave me the [ __ ] alone you [ __ ]

940.72 --> 943.279
[ __ ]

953.04 --> 958.16
right so let's get back to the subject

956.079 --> 960.399
that i will stick to

958.16 --> 962.399
and now get more intense because that's

960.399 --> 965.12
probably the [ __ ] reason you started

962.399 --> 970.72
doing that you [ __ ] scumbag

965.12 --> 975.199
you filthy troll scumbag agent bastard

970.72 --> 975.1990000000001
narrative reinforcing piece of [ __ ]

975.36 --> 978.48
yeah

976.399 --> 980.72
i'll just get back to what i was talking

978.48 --> 980.72
about

981.199 --> 986.079
right

983.04 --> 989.04
and that is that the programming against

986.079 --> 993.04
putin has been like engaging for 20

989.04 --> 994.8
years i've seen it happen

993.04 --> 999.5999999999999
i've seen it happen everywhere i've

994.8 --> 1000.959
already like over 10 years ago

999.6 --> 1003.519
i

1000.959 --> 1006.16
was literally trying to get through the

1003.519 --> 1009.519
people like hello this is a freaking

1006.16 --> 1012.16
satanic spell putin is actually

1009.519 --> 1014.24
despite everything and despite

1012.16 --> 1016.56
[ __ ] in his background

1014.24 --> 1019.12
and in the past you know

1016.56 --> 1021.279
it's like oh yo well what the [ __ ] did

1019.12 --> 1023.92
you expect man he freaking grew up in

1021.279 --> 1026.559
the soviet union like what the [ __ ] do

1023.92 --> 1028.6399999999999
you expect you know

1026.559 --> 1030.72
you're gonna grow up in the soviet union

1028.64 --> 1032.72
actually attain some grip on the world

1030.72 --> 1035.1200000000001
and power and not have [ __ ] in your

1032.72 --> 1036.559
background well good [ __ ] luck with

1035.12 --> 1038.4799999999998
that

1036.559 --> 1040.6399999999999
you know so i've been

1038.48 --> 1043.919
trying to defend him to people in the

1040.64 --> 1048.96
past literally like applying speaking

1043.919 --> 1051.44
magic to do that very unexpectedly

1048.96 --> 1053.28
people would actually respect that

1051.44 --> 1055.2
in that moment i could in that moment

1053.28 --> 1056.799
snap them out of it

1055.2 --> 1059.44
but everybody would just forget again

1056.799 --> 1061.44
because like every time he's brought up

1059.44 --> 1063.76
in media there's always like this

1061.44 --> 1064.72
feeling angle and people just fall in

1063.76 --> 1066.32
line

1064.72 --> 1068.4
so they don't know what the [ __ ] they're

1066.32 --> 1069.28
doing the spell has been going for so

1068.4 --> 1071.3600000000001
long

1069.28 --> 1074.08
it's not surprising that most people are

1071.36 --> 1075.28
just gonna basically do an orange man

1074.08 --> 1077.9189999999999
bad

1075.28 --> 1077.9189999999999
on putin

1078.32 --> 1085.36
maybe he's like white man the trump is

1080.799 --> 1085.36
orange man and putin is white man right

1086.32 --> 1090.48
the orange man was like completely

1088.32 --> 1092.84
ridiculous by the way it like the whole

1090.48 --> 1095.919
thing was quite

1092.84 --> 1098.08
insane right because he is like the

1095.919 --> 1099.3600000000001
gayest president the united states has

1098.08 --> 1102.48
ever known

1099.36 --> 1103.1999999999998
so the whole thing was just crazy

1102.48 --> 1107.88
but

1103.2 --> 1107.88
there's just a lot of crazy going on

1118.48 --> 1126.0
it's a bit oh well so refined opinion

1122.4 --> 1126.0
there oh beautiful

1127.039 --> 1130.32
so enlightening there

1134.84 --> 1142.8799999999999
again i don't care we are all [ __ ]

1138.32 --> 1145.039
puppets dude all of us you are a puppet

1142.88 --> 1147.7600000000002
you just don't know it i'm a puppet i

1145.039 --> 1150.4
kind of know it yeah they are puppets oh

1147.76 --> 1152.24
yeah they know it yeah so what the

1150.4 --> 1155.2
[ __ ] the point we're all [ __ ]

1152.24 --> 1156.32
puppets most of you just think

1155.2 --> 1158.32
you're not

1156.32 --> 1159.84
because you're too short-sighted in how

1158.32 --> 1161.84
this freaking world and all the

1159.84 --> 1163.6
mechanics and everything you do and

1161.84 --> 1165.9189999999999
everything you learn and your source of

1163.6 --> 1169.039
information actually works

1165.919 --> 1172.0800000000002
he's a puppet oh yeah every freaking

1169.039 --> 1176.76
person in the world is a puppet

1172.08 --> 1176.76
you don't understand how this works

1188.24 --> 1192.76
yeah borders boy i get that

1205.28 --> 1208.8799999999999
it's like oh

1207.039 --> 1211.12
it's like one chess piece calling

1208.88 --> 1212.5590000000002
another chess piece like oh you're just

1211.12 --> 1215.28
a pawn

1212.559 --> 1218.08
yeah well you're just a pawn we're all

1215.28 --> 1220.96
just freaking pawns on this board

1218.08 --> 1222.3999999999999
none of us are the ones actually playing

1220.96 --> 1224.0
us

1222.4 --> 1226.4
so yeah oh

1224.0 --> 1226.4
wow

1228.08 --> 1231.3999999999999
what a realization

1242.24 --> 1245.6
all right service day good to hear yeah

1244.4 --> 1249.8400000000001
so am i

1245.6 --> 1249.84
and it's purely about moral stance

1256.08 --> 1259.4399999999998
right

1257.2 --> 1262.48
like from everything he's done i have

1259.44 --> 1265.52
very little issues with it some things

1262.48 --> 1266.72
are like oh that doesn't seem very nice

1265.52 --> 1268.72
right

1266.72 --> 1270.48
that's it that's like the the biggest

1268.72 --> 1272.96
problem that some things

1270.48 --> 1275.52
of his policies they're not very nice

1272.96 --> 1277.52
but are they effective

1275.52 --> 1280.24
oh yeah

1277.52 --> 1280.24
oh yeah

1280.559 --> 1287.36
right effective and actually achieving

1282.96 --> 1287.3600000000001
what the people want to achieve with it

1289.039 --> 1292.72
like putin's not a guy that freaking

1291.12 --> 1294.32
virtue signals

1292.72 --> 1296.4
ever

1294.32 --> 1299.52
he just does

1296.4 --> 1303.6000000000001
things he actually changes things he

1299.52 --> 1303.6
plans it out super strategic

1303.679 --> 1306.48
and effective

1307.84 --> 1312.559
and

1308.64 --> 1314.88
yeah he holds his ground

1312.559 --> 1317.44
even in things that are just like

1314.88 --> 1320.0
they're yeah that'll drive any person

1317.44 --> 1322.88
raving mad because of the whining the

1320.0 --> 1326.08
endless whining and complaining and

1322.88 --> 1331.48
backstabbing that starts to happen

1326.08 --> 1331.48
like his stance yeah against lgbt

1335.12 --> 1339.4399999999998
right that's just

1337.039 --> 1341.679
to do that like that in this world is

1339.44 --> 1341.679
just

1342.48 --> 1345.88
really tough

1354.32 --> 1362.6399999999999
poker is a wisdom oh yeah woo okay bye

1358.4 --> 1362.64
sock account of somebody that i banned

1365.36 --> 1368.9599999999998
yeah

1366.96 --> 1371.52
i know i banned you

1368.96 --> 1372.8400000000001
you're not supposed to be here [ __ ]

1371.52 --> 1377.2
get the [ __ ]

1372.84 --> 1380.8799999999999
up nobody cares about your really gross

1377.2 --> 1383.6000000000001
disgusting show on your channel

1380.88 --> 1389.3200000000002
and nobody cares about your opinion

1383.6 --> 1389.32
gill ambrose so [ __ ] off with your socks

1429.36 --> 1432.9599999999998
oh really inspect

1431.12 --> 1436.279
the single player game that sounds

1432.96 --> 1436.279
pretty weird

1446.72 --> 1450.559
yeah so but you have heard of that

1454.559 --> 1458.72
i've heard that it's been this bad but

1456.64 --> 1461.8400000000001
it yeah you don't know

1458.72 --> 1464.4
like i'm pretty worried about that

1461.84 --> 1465.279
i hope it's for nothing i hope it's just

1464.4 --> 1467.76
me

1465.279 --> 1470.88
being jittery

1467.76 --> 1474.0
that's why i got so excited two days ago

1470.88 --> 1476.72
on my show and made you all guess

1474.0 --> 1479.2
although i did miss out on somebody

1476.72 --> 1482.48
actually mentioning the kazaars

1479.2 --> 1482.48
i hadn't even thought about it

1483.6 --> 1488.8799999999999
about that part

1487.039 --> 1490.72
and yes a lot of people out there

1488.88 --> 1493.1200000000001
talking about it

1490.72 --> 1496.96
including own benjamin

1493.12 --> 1496.9599999999998
and it's it is very interesting

1498.799 --> 1503.039
definitely worth taking notice off

1503.76 --> 1508.32
also yeah oh benjamin man this friday

1506.48 --> 1511.679
show how to fake world war three that

1508.32 --> 1515.279
was that was really surreal

1511.679 --> 1518.72
like there's there's something to that

1515.279 --> 1521.44
like he was making a lot of sense there

1518.72 --> 1521.44
in that show

1524.559 --> 1530.1589999999999
so yeah i can't wait to finish that

1528.799 --> 1532.72
i haven't

1530.159 --> 1534.5590000000002
gotten like past half an hour but

1532.72 --> 1537.3600000000001
like already in that first half hour

1534.559 --> 1538.72
like he really laid down some logical

1537.36 --> 1540.8799999999999
structure

1538.72 --> 1543.84
that's definitely worth

1540.88 --> 1543.8400000000001
keeping in mind

1545.76 --> 1550.64
about like how would they

1548.32 --> 1551.76
fake certain aspect or like how would

1550.64 --> 1552.96
they

1551.76 --> 1557.2
create

1552.96 --> 1559.2
nuke-like effects outside of bombing

1557.2 --> 1561.76
and he really was onto something and

1559.2 --> 1564.24
they're like this giant

1561.76 --> 1566.32
like it's basically even integrated into

1564.24 --> 1568.559
my dark world visions what he was just

1566.32 --> 1571.559
talking about that and i'm like what the

1568.559 --> 1571.559
[ __ ]

1574.799 --> 1580.32
he was talking in like fractal balance

1578.0 --> 1583.96
thinking he was talking like that he was

1580.32 --> 1583.96
just doing it

1585.039 --> 1589.679
so yeah

1586.24 --> 1592.72
i'm wondering can can i should i do that

1589.679 --> 1596.0800000000002
am i able to do that or is owen benjamin

1592.72 --> 1598.159
just in this condition in this position

1596.08 --> 1601.6789999999999
how he's arranged everything in his life

1598.159 --> 1601.679
that he can't just do that

1602.799 --> 1607.84
does that mean that i can't just like

1605.52 --> 1611.52
take off all the breaks and just start

1607.84 --> 1613.12
like full full listing

1611.52 --> 1615.12
i don't know

1613.12 --> 1616.2399999999998
i'm kind of scared of it maybe that's

1615.12 --> 1617.9189999999999
the problem

1616.24 --> 1620.88
maybe that was always the problems that

1617.919 --> 1622.7990000000002
i'm just like too freaking timid

1620.88 --> 1624.72
i was just too

1622.799 --> 1627.279
scared from everything that i've

1624.72 --> 1628.96
experienced

1627.279 --> 1631.039
i don't know

1628.96 --> 1634.72
i wonder sometimes very seriously like

1631.039 --> 1639.52
should i be doing any of this

1634.72 --> 1642.08
did i choose wrong did i overshoot did i

1639.52 --> 1644.96
choose something that's just a stupid

1642.08 --> 1647.12
fantasy and i can't actually physically

1644.96 --> 1649.8400000000001
achieve that but i was really freaking

1647.12 --> 1650.8799999999999
stubborn so i did it anyway and now i'm

1649.84 --> 1654.52
stuck

1650.88 --> 1654.5200000000002
i wonder sometimes

1655.36 --> 1660.559
should i be like yeah i can do parts of

1658.32 --> 1661.6789999999999
this but it seems like other people out

1660.559 --> 1665.24
there are

1661.679 --> 1665.24
better at it

1668.159 --> 1672.64
so sometimes i really wonder like why am

1670.799 --> 1675.12
i even here

1672.64 --> 1677.44
seriously why am i even here doing what

1675.12 --> 1679.4399999999998
i do

1677.44 --> 1680.24
being this sort of canary in the coal

1679.44 --> 1681.52
mine

1680.24 --> 1683.84
even though

1681.52 --> 1683.84
like

1684.96 --> 1688.559
does it

1686.0 --> 1691.279
who's like who's actually

1688.559 --> 1693.6789999999999
really critically important and keeping

1691.279 --> 1696.159
track of what i do

1693.679 --> 1699.039
it seems sometimes like i'm more of an

1696.159 --> 1701.44
actual like echo

1699.039 --> 1703.52
like i'm an echo of tomorrow of

1701.44 --> 1705.679
everybody else

1703.52 --> 1708.0
and nothing's coming from me because

1705.679 --> 1710.64
who's who is actually like really

1708.0 --> 1712.32
keeping track of me and is even gonna

1710.64 --> 1714.3200000000002
admit that

1712.32 --> 1716.559
except for people in the flat earth and

1714.32 --> 1719.6789999999999
i totally get that because yeah i'm kind

1716.559 --> 1722.96
of like dual cosmogeny but that's not my

1719.679 --> 1725.8400000000001
only interest like that's just this

1722.96 --> 1725.8400000000001
in this

1733.52 --> 1737.76
so is that it i'm just an echo of this

1735.76 --> 1740.559
of the near future and

1737.76 --> 1744.399
that's what i do and it seems so

1740.559 --> 1744.399
freaking pointless sometimes to me

1746.96 --> 1757.249
like where are my roots

1749.21 --> 1757.249
[Music]

1778.16 --> 1782.15
[Music]

1794.48 --> 1800.64
i freaking hate this mic

1797.12 --> 1800.6399999999999
always does that [ __ ]

1802.559 --> 1809.12
like why i can't even freaking touch my

1806.0 --> 1813.48
mic without it freaking turning off

1809.12 --> 1813.4799999999998
i hate this piece of [ __ ]

1828.64 --> 1831.64
so

1836.32 --> 1840.72
i agree with some things i say just not

1838.559 --> 1843.36
all of them yeah that's the most useless

1840.72 --> 1843.3600000000001
thing ever

1849.279 --> 1855.52
yeah well everybody in the freaking

1852.559 --> 1858.0
[ __ ] world seems to agree with some

1855.52 --> 1860.32
things i say but not everything oh

1858.0 --> 1862.799
that's so important

1860.32 --> 1865.039
that's so reassuring that i'm exactly on

1862.799 --> 1868.08
the right track because everybody in the

1865.039 --> 1870.1589999999999
world agrees about some things i say but

1868.08 --> 1871.6
never everything

1870.159 --> 1874.159
yeah

1871.6 --> 1874.1589999999999
brilliant

1877.039 --> 1884.24
yeah i don't need a doobie service day

1880.48 --> 1884.24
that doesn't actually help you know

1890.32 --> 1893.76
hey rick back oh you were actually there

1892.32 --> 1894.799
listening

1893.76 --> 1896.8799999999999
huh

1894.799 --> 1899.279
well i did of course get through like on

1896.88 --> 1902.519
discord but i don't know if nathan kept

1899.279 --> 1902.519
that in

1918.159 --> 1924.0800000000002
you don't really give answer

1921.44 --> 1926.559
answers either

1924.08 --> 1929.039
oh answers to what is anybody asking the

1926.559 --> 1929.039
question

1931.6 --> 1937.519
do i ever not give a full answer

1935.36 --> 1940.0
when somebody's actually honestly asking

1937.519 --> 1940.0
a question

1940.64 --> 1945.919
oh yeah sometimes i do but that's only

1943.12 --> 1949.84
because i then like i just don't want to

1945.919 --> 1949.8400000000001
literally throw up

1955.84 --> 1961.36
because i am like subjected to tensions

1958.72 --> 1964.72

every freaking time

1991.039 --> 1996.48
i don't want it anymore i just want to

1993.519 --> 1998.88
be able to communicate something exactly

1996.48 --> 2001.2
as it is without something

1998.88 --> 2004.679
feeling like i'm getting crushed every

2001.2 --> 2004.679
[ __ ] time

2008.48 --> 2016.039

about my

2037.36 --> 2040.6399999999999

[ __ ] way it does it doesn't make

2087.44 --> 2091.76

communicate the ideas the insides and

2125.92 --> 2131.76
just

2127.28 --> 2135.119

2131.76 --> 2137.2000000000003
every time i address something

2135.119 --> 2139.119
i just want to be able to just

2137.2 --> 2143.72
communicate

2139.119 --> 2143.7200000000003
without the [ __ ] pain

2174.16 --> 2179.2
giving the truth exactly yeah yeah well

2176.56 --> 2181.2

2201.76 --> 2206.0
what the [ __ ] to do about this i don't

2203.52 --> 2208.56

2206.0 --> 2211.76
nothing i can pray to knows about what

2208.56 --> 2214.7999999999997
the [ __ ] to do about this the only

2211.76 --> 2218.2400000000002
end result i just get to is just

2214.8 --> 2220.1600000000003
freaking take the torture just that like

2218.24 --> 2222.56
that's the only [ __ ] thing i'm

2220.16 --> 2225.56
supposed to do is just take the [ __ ]

2222.56 --> 2225.56
torture

2254.079 --> 2258.8
yeah well guess what taking the [ __ ]

2256.88 --> 2259.839
torture

2258.8 --> 2261.8390000000004
breaks

2259.839 --> 2265.119
my abilities

2261.839 --> 2268.119
it makes me unable to do what i'm good

2265.119 --> 2268.119
at

2274.0 --> 2280.64
and the only freaking way i can even

2277.2 --> 2284.24
temporarily escape from it is by

2280.64 --> 2287.2799999999997
venting rage yeah you know how [ __ ]

2284.24 --> 2290.8799999999997
weak i feel being bound to that type of

2287.28 --> 2292.2400000000002
action just to get a glimpse like i can

2290.88 --> 2295.7200000000003
survive

2292.24 --> 2295.72
it's terrible

2324.24 --> 2328.72
that's the devil you don't know what the

2326.56 --> 2329.839
[ __ ] you're talking about i'm expressing

2328.72 --> 2332.64
myself

2329.839 --> 2335.04
surface day you don't have the [ __ ]

2332.64 --> 2337.04
ability to tell

2335.04 --> 2340.32
what's talking through me

2337.04 --> 2342.64
you seem to be so easily just like oh

2340.32 --> 2346.4
i'm just gonna do that you don't have

2342.64 --> 2346.4
the [ __ ] level to do that

2346.72 --> 2353.5989999999997
stop pretending like you're some high

2349.76 --> 2356.6400000000003
inside spirit you're not

2353.599 --> 2359.119
you're you're okay

2356.64 --> 2360.48
sometimes

2359.119 --> 2363.839
yeah

2360.48 --> 2363.839
you can't judge me

2364.88 --> 2370.1600000000003
you did not get what i said yeah i did i

2367.28 --> 2370.1600000000003
read every word

2373.839 --> 2378.72
if it's the devil talking through me

2376.24 --> 2382.16
like everybody will know

2378.72 --> 2386.56
because that's a whole different tone

2382.16 --> 2389.1189999999997
i'm just expressing my personal pain

2386.56 --> 2392.48
it's not the devil talking that's me

2389.119 --> 2392.48
being [ __ ] honest

2395.44 --> 2398.8
there you go oh oh you you need a

2397.2 --> 2400.3999999999996
timeout again

2398.8 --> 2403.76
because you're not gonna stand down

2400.4 --> 2406.2400000000002
right you don't stand down anymore

2403.76 --> 2408.2400000000002
right you're just gonna be an [ __ ]

2406.24 --> 2410.24
then

2408.24 --> 2412.4799999999996
because that's your new attitude isn't

2410.24 --> 2414.0
it that's what you've been doing

2412.48 --> 2416.8
for quite a while

2414.0 --> 2419.44
you don't know when to back down ever

2416.8 --> 2422.7200000000003
even though like it's not actually your

2419.44 --> 2424.8
place to to have that position in the

2422.72 --> 2425.7599999999998
social situation because it's not your

2424.8 --> 2427.8390000000004
show

2425.76 --> 2429.8390000000004
and yet you're still going to do it yeah

2427.839 --> 2431.119
and then you're going to chant again and

2429.839 --> 2432.88
enchant again and then you're going to

2431.119 --> 2435.52
get banned

2432.88 --> 2437.76
because you don't know how to [ __ ]

2435.52 --> 2440.24
get a grip on yourself and that's why

2437.76 --> 2442.4
you got banned again now because you're

2440.24 --> 2444.319
completely out of place

2442.4 --> 2446.7200000000003
you don't know how to size up the

2444.319 --> 2449.2
situation you don't know how to deal

2446.72 --> 2449.2
with me

2449.44 --> 2454.7200000000003
you don't know when to back the [ __ ]

2451.839 --> 2459.24
down just like 10th man doesn't know

2454.72 --> 2459.24
when to [ __ ] back down

2466.319 --> 2472.319
i don't care if he's my enemy

2470.16 --> 2473.7599999999998
he's not backing down and he should and

2472.319 --> 2476.0
now he's banned

2473.76 --> 2479.2000000000003
oh and ban him at some other time

2476.0 --> 2482.16
because i don't want to now hear endless

2479.2 --> 2484.16
chanting blabbering in my chat now

2482.16 --> 2486.8799999999997
because he doesn't know when to shut the

2484.16 --> 2486.8799999999997
[ __ ] up

2488.319 --> 2494.119
don't tell me what to do single player

2491.119 --> 2494.119
gaming

2502.4 --> 2510.4
you all need to just learn

2505.28 --> 2510.4
when to just shut the [ __ ] up

2511.76 --> 2515.92
like have you ever been in the presence

2513.76 --> 2518.2400000000002
of somebody that is in this kind of

2515.92 --> 2520.88
emotional state face to face do you

2518.24 --> 2523.1189999999997
start blabbering over them how did that

2520.88 --> 2527.6400000000003
work out huh

2523.119 --> 2527.6400000000003
are you even paying attention

2548.72 --> 2554.16
maybe it's time to work on my art what

2551.76 --> 2554.1600000000003
art

2560.48 --> 2564.56
like i want to give you a hug or

2561.839 --> 2566.48
something yeah i get that that actually

2564.56 --> 2569.119
works that intention can go right

2566.48 --> 2571.92
through the screen i receive it

2569.119 --> 2573.52
it actually works

2571.92 --> 2577.44
what doesn't work

2573.52 --> 2580.24
is like doubling down like no no i'm

2577.44 --> 2585.079
going to do this now i'm going to chat

2580.24 --> 2585.0789999999997
like no that doesn't actually help

2606.56 --> 2612.0
may i ask what has caused this for me

2610.24 --> 2614.3999999999996
i don't know

2612.0 --> 2617.04
i think i was born with it partially

2614.4 --> 2619.839
thanks to my mother i've been a complete

2617.04 --> 2622.4
fuck-up [ __ ] in the past

2619.839 --> 2625.2799999999997
i've literally let just parts of my soul

2622.4 --> 2627.359
get stripped because of my stupid

2625.28 --> 2629.599
naivety

2627.359 --> 2632.56
i've been part of medical experiments

2629.599 --> 2635.599
without even realizing it

2632.56 --> 2636.88
in the past i've been through all kinds

2635.599 --> 2639.599
of [ __ ]

2636.88 --> 2642.1600000000003
i've hung around with like the worst

2639.599 --> 2645.04
imaginable people

2642.16 --> 2647.52
that i can't even mention

2645.04 --> 2648.56
anything about it

2647.52 --> 2651.52
yeah

2648.56 --> 2654.0
i've been through so much stupid [ __ ]

2651.52 --> 2656.16
out of this misguided sense that i

2654.0 --> 2658.079
somehow had a mission

2656.16 --> 2660.56
even though i didn't actually know what

2658.079 --> 2662.48
it really was it's just a feeling that i

2660.56 --> 2664.72
carried through all this time

2662.48 --> 2666.48
and guess what that feelings turn into

2664.72 --> 2669.68
pure pain

2666.48 --> 2669.68
it's just pain

2669.76 --> 2675.3590000000004
if nothing i did actually turn out to be

2672.8 --> 2675.3590000000004
worth it

2675.76 --> 2680.5600000000004
i got some skill but i don't have the

2678.16 --> 2686.1189999999997
power to freaking use it because every

2680.56 --> 2686.119
time i do something i i get tortured

2698.88 --> 2701.88
so

2713.04 --> 2719.079
oh marco bugs okay it's you right

2723.76 --> 2728.48
yeah i'm just i'm i'm

2726.0 --> 2730.96
i'm just getting i'm out of control

2728.48 --> 2734.64
today because of the freaking pain it's

2730.96 --> 2734.64
pain it's physical pain

2734.88 --> 2739.2000000000003
and i'm afraid that i'm gonna follow my

2737.119 --> 2740.0
mother in this [ __ ]

2739.2 --> 2742.48
because

2740.0 --> 2746.04
it's even working out according to the

2742.48 --> 2746.04
freaking age

2749.92 --> 2753.76
and i'm terrified i'm terrified that i'm

2752.16 --> 2755.5989999999997
gonna die

2753.76 --> 2757.3590000000004
pretty young and that there's nothing i

2755.599 --> 2761.839
can do about it and then i'm gonna be in

2757.359 --> 2764.319
a torturous hellish pain up and like

2761.839 --> 2766.0
just building up until i can't handle it

2764.319 --> 2770.68
anymore something inside of me is going

2766.0 --> 2770.68
to snap yeah that's what i fear

2776.319 --> 2779.68
and i'm just

2777.52 --> 2781.92
panickingly in my spirit and this

2779.68 --> 2784.16
happens every now and then

2781.92 --> 2787.119
just trying to figure out like how could

2784.16 --> 2789.839
i have avoided this like how could have

2787.119 --> 2789.839
just

2790.4 --> 2795.839
i'm just so incredibly

2794.4 --> 2798.319
regretting

2795.839 --> 2801.68
[ __ ] that's happened in my past like i'm

2798.319 --> 2804.48
so incredibly regretting it like i just

2801.68 --> 2807.68
wish there was just some guy

2804.48 --> 2808.88
that just like sh darwin you [ __ ]

2807.68 --> 2812.0789999999997
idiot

2808.88 --> 2815.6800000000003
just stop that [ __ ] come with me we're

2812.079 --> 2817.76
gonna do something else not this [ __ ]

2815.68 --> 2819.5989999999997
you [ __ ] idiot

2817.76 --> 2821.8390000000004
you [ __ ] idiot

2819.599 --> 2824.8
what the [ __ ] are you doing you [ __ ]

2821.839 --> 2825.839
[ __ ] why wasn't there somebody to just

2824.8 --> 2829.2000000000003
like

2825.839 --> 2833.64
totally dominate the [ __ ] out of me so

2829.2 --> 2833.64
i'd snap out of that insanity

2850.319 --> 2853.04
it's just that

2854.559 --> 2858.559
seeing people

2856.48 --> 2863.44
like even around you

2858.559 --> 2863.44
that are just like laughing at your face

2863.839 --> 2868.48
because like

2865.92 --> 2871.04
they've effectively allowed

2868.48 --> 2873.359
horrible crimes to be completely legal

2871.04 --> 2876.48
and they know it and they taunt you with

2873.359 --> 2878.72
it the pain that it causes you yeah i've

2876.48 --> 2882.319
been like

2878.72 --> 2882.319
with those [ __ ] people

2884.24 --> 2890.319
i i don't understand why i was doing

2887.92 --> 2893.319
that

2890.319 --> 2893.319
why

2920.48 --> 2924.64
you know what so what is so freaking

2922.72 --> 2925.839
hilarious and ironic about it all is

2924.64 --> 2928.96
that

2925.839 --> 2932.0
an excuse i used at some point is that

2928.96 --> 2935.119
oh i'm just an artist i'm i do art

2932.0 --> 2937.52
that's why i'm living like a recluse and

2935.119 --> 2939.28
not evolving in society it's all because

2937.52 --> 2941.7599999999998
of that

2939.28 --> 2944.3190000000004
guess what

2941.76 --> 2947.5200000000004
i literally just i don't even have

2944.319 --> 2950.96
creative impulses anymore they're gone

2947.52 --> 2953.92
they're like really really gone

2950.96 --> 2956.88
for a long time and the only way i even

2953.92 --> 2959.52
get any creative ideas is by kindness

2956.88 --> 2961.28
like snatching them from moments from

2959.52 --> 2963.119
other people

2961.28 --> 2965.6800000000003
because they just don't

2963.119 --> 2970.119
well up anymore the only [ __ ] things

2965.68 --> 2970.1189999999997
that well up is nightmares

2973.76 --> 2978.76
devastating terrible ideas

2989.28 --> 2992.28
so

3024.079 --> 3027.8390000000004
thank you elise g

3033.599 --> 3039.6800000000003
well technically you guys could help me

3037.2 --> 3042.48
i mean it seems like freaking money the

3039.68 --> 3045.5989999999997
one thing i can't actually get

3042.48 --> 3050.0
because i somehow chose to basically

3045.599 --> 3052.319
discard that part from my entire life

3050.0 --> 3055.839
but it is like a thing that actually

3052.319 --> 3055.839
seems to help

3058.0 --> 3059.92
because

3058.96 --> 3064.2400000000002
then

3059.92 --> 3067.599
i don't have any more just like

3064.24 --> 3071.2799999999997
i don't know man i i don't know

3067.599 --> 3071.28
i don't know what helps anymore

3074.64 --> 3080.96
i although statistically every time i

3077.839 --> 3083.2
get into pretty tight spots financially

3080.96 --> 3084.8
that's when i get like this that's when

3083.2 --> 3086.72
i lose like

3084.8 --> 3089.119
that's when like the nightmares really

3086.72 --> 3090.5589999999997
start flushing over me

3089.119 --> 3093.599
so yeah

3090.559 --> 3097.52
i guess that money does actually help

3093.599 --> 3100.0
so funny so funny that little mechanism

3097.52 --> 3102.72
that presented itself that oh it helps

3100.0 --> 3104.319
oh that one thing i can't actually

3102.72 --> 3107.2799999999997
[ __ ] get

3104.319 --> 3109.359
because the way i arranged my life

3107.28 --> 3114.6800000000003
so brilliant

3109.359 --> 3114.68
i'm such a [ __ ] genius irwin

3139.599 --> 3142.599
uh

3159.76 --> 3163.2000000000003
you know what the funniest thing about

3161.839 --> 3165.7599999999998
all of that is

3163.2 --> 3168.7999999999997
the way i arranged my life

3165.76 --> 3173.599
that every time somebody is just

3168.8 --> 3176.88
like this is on me disrespects me

3173.599 --> 3180.48
for being in those positions yeah

3176.88 --> 3182.2400000000002
every time i actually feel like i

3180.48 --> 3184.559
deserve it

3182.24 --> 3184.5589999999997
yeah

3184.72 --> 3188.48
you know how fun that is

3188.559 --> 3194.599
huh

3190.0 --> 3194.599
you know how great that feels

3228.319 --> 3235.0
try to rehab

3231.04 --> 3235.0
in order for what

3241.68 --> 3247.5989999999997
like my drug habits aren't really even

3244.88 --> 3249.839
that financially draining overall

3247.599 --> 3253.44
i mean they they have been like if i

3249.839 --> 3255.599
just let it go yeah then that becomes

3253.44 --> 3258.4
like a huge gap

3255.599 --> 3261.2000000000003
i don't do that though i'm very careful

3258.4 --> 3264.0
because i don't like to be

3261.2 --> 3266.48
like every month or so just gets slapped

3264.0 --> 3268.96
in the face by oh oh you didn't take

3266.48 --> 3272.4
care again now your life is completely

3268.96 --> 3274.64
[ __ ] yeah that's why i don't do that

3272.4 --> 3277.04
anymore

3274.64 --> 3279.04
i try to be extremely careful with my

3277.04 --> 3279.839
money

3279.04 --> 3282.079
yeah

3279.839 --> 3284.48
i'm like

3282.079 --> 3286.88
freaking i already feel like i've been

3284.48 --> 3289.359
in a war for quite a long time like how

3286.88 --> 3292.079
i'm like carefully like just like all

3289.359 --> 3292.799
these things that i would want and can

3292.079 --> 3295.28
like

3292.799 --> 3296.96
yeah you can't have any of that

3295.28 --> 3299.119
none of it

3296.96 --> 3302.079
yeah

3299.119 --> 3304.4
yeah i can't even get new shoes

3302.079 --> 3304.4
yeah

3305.52 --> 3308.96
everything i'm wearing is like 10 years

3307.76 --> 3312.3190000000004
old

3308.96 --> 3313.68
so fun it's so fun living like that so

3312.319 --> 3316.0
great

3313.68 --> 3320.2
i'm so happy

3316.0 --> 3320.2
so [ __ ] happy

3335.76 --> 3338.0
no

3339.599 --> 3345.48
but it's not

3341.04 --> 3345.48
and i'm actually using it

3355.359 --> 3361.96
jesus 60 dollars per week for weeds

3358.48 --> 3361.96
that's a lot

3367.04 --> 3372.88
yeah you need someone to help cultivate

3369.119 --> 3372.88
my special ability that's right

3375.04 --> 3381.839
yeah also i'm really terrible at being

3379.04 --> 3381.839
solitary

3384.48 --> 3389.68
i've like forced myself into a position

3387.359 --> 3393.2
where i'm like always alone

3389.68 --> 3396.96
and actually terrible at it

3393.2 --> 3399.839
i'm actually not good at that

3396.96 --> 3401.68
i've just forced myself to like

3399.839 --> 3404.5589999999997
become good at that

3401.68 --> 3406.96
but i'm never naturally good at that but

3404.559 --> 3407.8390000000004
because i forced myself to be good at

3406.96 --> 3412.559
that

3407.839 --> 3412.5589999999997
now i have like a lot of withdrawal

3413.599 --> 3417.76
when i actually

3415.2 --> 3420.48
interact with people physically it's

3417.76 --> 3422.1600000000003
like over stimulating to me

3420.48 --> 3424.0
it's always been kind of over

3422.16 --> 3426.3999999999996
stimulating to me but that's kind of

3424.0 --> 3428.88
like i guess because

3426.4 --> 3431.28
if i then just

3428.88 --> 3433.119
start to rely on those types of

3431.28 --> 3436.559
interactions with people then i can

3433.119 --> 3439.28
suddenly build on it a whole thing goes

3436.559 --> 3442.7200000000003
yeah i've never actually developed that

3439.28 --> 3442.7200000000003
like beyond my teens

3442.96 --> 3447.599
because of this

3444.799 --> 3450.64
[ __ ] arrangement that i put myself in

3447.599 --> 3453.52
which is like the most counterproductive

3450.64 --> 3458.52
torturous idiotic setup i could have

3453.52 --> 3458.52
ever imagined to create for myself

3473.68 --> 3477.359
you get let down yeah because

3479.68 --> 3484.48
like oh yeah let's start now i mean

3482.72 --> 3488.319
it's not like

3484.48 --> 3490.319
a lot of people are completely deranged

3488.319 --> 3491.92
in ways they don't even realize that it

3490.319 --> 3494.64
is deranged

3491.92 --> 3497.28
i mean it's so easy right now

3494.64 --> 3500.24
to just find reliable people they're

3497.28 --> 3502.48
everywhere reliable people everywhere

3500.24 --> 3504.799
right you could just build a community

3502.48 --> 3508.52
just like that it's not like everybody's

3504.799 --> 3508.52
completely deranged

3536.72 --> 3539.72
so

3544.88 --> 3550.559
just like even nice people

3548.0 --> 3552.559
remember that time

3550.559 --> 3554.1600000000003
remember the time when it's like oh yeah

3552.559 --> 3555.599
you have just like the common people

3554.16 --> 3557.839
they're reliable they're cool and then

3555.599 --> 3560.1600000000003
you have like kind of interesting people

3557.839 --> 3561.92
but they'll have a crazy side remember

3560.16 --> 3563.44
that

3561.92 --> 3566.2400000000002
and some people were like really

3563.44 --> 3568.4
attracted to that like yeah to some

3566.24 --> 3569.5989999999997
whole chick but it was kind of insane

3568.4 --> 3570.7200000000003
actually

3569.599 --> 3575.3590000000004
right

3570.72 --> 3575.359
that seems to be like the norm now

3575.52 --> 3582.0
every there's like no more normal people

3578.079 --> 3582.0
they're all insane now

3582.319 --> 3590.0
through copy-paste garbage through media

3586.559 --> 3592.079
through popular television series

3590.0 --> 3596.72
like everybody's like programmed

3592.079 --> 3596.7200000000003
themselves to be deranged now

3596.799 --> 3601.839
they don't remember what it's like to

3598.799 --> 3601.839
just be normal

3626.839 --> 3631.119
okay i'm gonna eat some of this pie

3629.599 --> 3632.79
again

3631.119 --> 3634.319
maybe they'll calm me down

3632.79 --> 3636.24
[Music]

3634.319 --> 3638.4
dude i don't even know what's going on

3636.24 --> 3640.5589999999997
in my body

3638.4 --> 3642.1600000000003
i'm wondering sometimes like

3640.559 --> 3645.28
is this some kind of like

3642.16 --> 3645.2799999999997
diabetes [ __ ]

3646.48 --> 3650.72
i mean that would hurt

3648.72 --> 3653.2799999999997
and it does seem to be kind of that

3650.72 --> 3655.68
location but then again at other times

3653.28 --> 3658.88
it's like no it doesn't like that i

3655.68 --> 3658.8799999999997
don't know what it is

3664.96 --> 3671.04
but yeah no the pie seems to have worked

3667.44 --> 3672.96
out so it's not like oh

3671.04 --> 3675.04
right but i'm very careful with sugar

3672.96 --> 3677.04
and yeah that's been building for a

3675.04 --> 3678.96
while so maybe it's just gotten worse

3677.04 --> 3680.96
and i'm now entering a stage where i'm

3678.96 --> 3682.799
actually gonna get full-blown freaking

3680.96 --> 3684.96
diabetes

3682.799 --> 3687.599
and since i don't actually go to a

3684.96 --> 3690.0
doctor i'm at the point where i'm so

3687.599 --> 3693.6800000000003
[ __ ] fed up with this role i'd i'd

3690.0 --> 3698.64
rather just die slowly than to even

3693.68 --> 3700.72
engage out of sheer idiotic pride

3698.64 --> 3702.48
right

3700.72 --> 3706.4399999999996
i don't know how to finish that sentence

3702.48 --> 3706.44
but i think you got the point

3715.92 --> 3720.88
yeah by the way thank you for the super

3717.52 --> 3720.88
chats guys i'm

3722.48 --> 3727.76
just going a bit ballistic here

3725.44 --> 3730.96
thank you by the way gordzilla

3727.76 --> 3734.2400000000002

and for the five pounds matthew hall

3738.48 --> 3745.44
still prefer paypal that will be great

3740.96 --> 3745.44
but yeah super chats are a nice gesture

3745.52 --> 3750.079
you are not overweight you don't drink

3747.44 --> 3753.48
much diabetes is not likely thank you

3750.079 --> 3753.48
for that reinsurance

3754.64 --> 3758.64
but

3756.319 --> 3761.7599999999998
there does seem to be just something

3758.64 --> 3764.0
wrong i don't i respond really badly to

3761.76 --> 3765.5200000000004
sugar in general and i even like avoid

3764.0 --> 3769.2
it now i

3765.52 --> 3771.7599999999998
i don't like the taste of sugar anymore

3769.2 --> 3772.72
because of the direct association i have

3771.76 --> 3774.0
with it

3772.72 --> 3776.3999999999996
really

3774.0 --> 3776.4
really

3780.839 --> 3784.24
hmm um

3791.119 --> 3796.319
thank you for becoming an arcane archer

3794.64 --> 3799.359
sven bones

3796.319 --> 3799.359
i appreciate that

3806.079 --> 3811.039
right drink pure sugar every night you

3808.48 --> 3812.96
might get dude

3811.039 --> 3814.48
like

3812.96 --> 3816.48
i

3814.48 --> 3818.88
if that is really how that works then i

3816.48 --> 3821.68
don't know how how i would ever be able

3818.88 --> 3825.039
to get diabetes because that would just

3821.68 --> 3826.8799999999997
like be purely painful

3825.039 --> 3830.4
it it hurts

3826.88 --> 3830.4
sugar actually hurts

3831.68 --> 3836.3999999999996
physically like if

3833.52 --> 3839.28
pain sensation like man

3836.4 --> 3841.359
if that's not diabetes then then i would

3839.28 --> 3843.92
never be able to get it because i just

3841.359 --> 3846.0
like it's too painful like i can't even

3843.92 --> 3848.4
enjoy it anymore i used to be like quite

3846.0 --> 3853.079
a sugar addict in a way when i was

3848.4 --> 3853.079
younger oh it doesn't work anymore

3853.68 --> 3858.16
salt is even more destructive are you

3855.68 --> 3858.16
kidding me

3859.119 --> 3864.7200000000003
salt is great

3862.079 --> 3868.319
i need it

3864.72 --> 3868.319
salt doesn't actually hurt

3868.48 --> 3873.4
and my kidneys seem to be doing just

3870.4 --> 3873.4
fine

3883.359 --> 3886.359
hmm

3895.039 --> 3898.039
so

3926.319 --> 3932.319
what the hell

3928.319 --> 3932.319
what does that mean single player gaming

3933.92 --> 3937.2000000000003
atheist

3935.36 --> 3940.6800000000003
[Music]

3937.2 --> 3940.68
what is that

3953.52 --> 3957.68
or you mean

3955.44 --> 3960.96
arteries

3957.68 --> 3963.96
clog or something

3960.96 --> 3963.96
right

3967.92 --> 3973.6800000000003
well i respond really well to salt

3972.319 --> 3976.4
so well

3973.68 --> 3978.8799999999997
that i can like take amounts that would

3976.4 --> 3980.1600000000003
be considered a lethal dose to some

3978.88 --> 3981.6800000000003
people

3980.16 --> 3983.0389999999998
really

3981.68 --> 3986.64
there's like this

3983.039 --> 3989.28
salt candy kind of thing lactose all

3986.64 --> 3991.0389999999998
it's just pure salt

3989.28 --> 3993.92
with like yeah the

3991.039 --> 3996.96
licorice type of salt

3993.92 --> 3998.799
i'll just eat an entire roll in the span

3996.96 --> 4002.079
of like an hour

3998.799 --> 4004.4
and like my kidneys won't even like

4002.079 --> 4008.88
feel like they're like oh i'm so busy

4004.4 --> 4008.88
it's like i really handle salt

4013.119 --> 4019.28
like really handle salt i don't know why

4017.119 --> 4020.96
sometimes i feel like i'm like some kind

4019.28 --> 4023.2000000000003
of like half

4020.96 --> 4025.2
crystalline humanoid or something that i

4023.2 --> 4028.3999999999996
can't handle salt in the quantities that

4025.2 --> 4030.16
i can like without just like

4028.4 --> 4032.0
getting a heart attack or something

4030.16 --> 4035.72
because i can

4032.0 --> 4035.72
and i don't know why

4036.319 --> 4040.48
right but the same does not go for sugar

4044.24 --> 4047.24
ah

4049.28 --> 4052.28
so

4065.599 --> 4068.599
um

4084.4 --> 4087.4
that

4092.16 --> 4098.239
sour patch

4094.72 --> 4102.839
yeah i'm not super about sour

4098.239 --> 4102.839
i'm really super about salt

4117.199 --> 4120.199
um

4134.96 --> 4141.04
it's a dutch thing doubles out double

4137.44 --> 4141.04
salty licorice yeah yeah

4142.159 --> 4146.719
all those those types i don't really

4144.719 --> 4149.44
yeah they're they're nice but they're

4146.719 --> 4152.159
not really good for you

4149.44 --> 4155.04
like they don't feel well if i eat like

4152.159 --> 4156.719
a handful of that type of licorice

4155.04 --> 4158.96
that actually then starts to kind of

4156.719 --> 4162.799
hurt my stomach and all that

4158.96 --> 4162.799
i don't have that with la crosso

4165.04 --> 4171.2789999999995
pinkali malayan salty i love that [ __ ] i

4168.56 --> 4171.279
i never

4171.839 --> 4176.88
i basically always like overdose i

4174.239 --> 4180.239
always do like i'll do it italian style

4176.88 --> 4184.0
a lot of salt

4180.239 --> 4184.0
licorice gag okay

4185.6 --> 4189.400000000001
yeah it's not for everyone

4193.679 --> 4199.6
would you like to do a meet and greet

4197.28 --> 4199.599999999999
sure

4200.159 --> 4203.32
i guess

4241.04 --> 4247.199
wow yeah single player dude

4245.04 --> 4250.239
yeah things like aspartame and all that

4247.199 --> 4252.0
artificial sugar i i never even get

4250.239 --> 4254.639999999999
close to

4252.0 --> 4254.64
taking that

4254.719 --> 4259.52
that's pure poison to me and i can taste

4257.28 --> 4260.48
it i can taste it when it is in

4259.52 --> 4262.159000000001
something

4260.48 --> 4264.5599999999995
although i never usually even have to

4262.159 --> 4267.679
risk that because i literally

4264.56 --> 4272.080000000001
never drink anything

4267.679 --> 4273.679
that i haven't personally sourced

4272.08 --> 4276.719
i've been

4273.679 --> 4280.08
for almost 20 years living

4276.719 --> 4281.28
where every time i go somewhere i always

4280.08 --> 4284.8
always

4281.28 --> 4287.84
bring my own food and drinks always

4284.8 --> 4287.84
20 years almost

4292.56 --> 4299.64
well 20

4294.96 --> 4299.64
more like 16 years to be fair

4301.6 --> 4305.6
so i like i don't even like go out to

4304.64 --> 4307.679
eat

4305.6 --> 4309.76
ever it doesn't really matter where it's

4307.679 --> 4313.6
supposed to be unless it's like a

4309.76 --> 4316.2390000000005
guaranteed organic only place

4313.6 --> 4318.8
and then i might test it and see if it's

4316.239 --> 4322.5199999999995
actually some good or super overpriced

4318.8 --> 4322.52
and then it's not good

4332.96 --> 4338.199
how healthy would you say my diet is

4335.199 --> 4338.199
overall

4344.32 --> 4348.0
i don't know how to compare that

4354.88 --> 4359.04
i mean i think it's actually that all

4357.12 --> 4361.84
depends on like what your

4359.04 --> 4363.199
what your measurement stakes going to be

4361.84 --> 4365.04
right

4363.199 --> 4367.12
because overall i don't eat enough

4365.04 --> 4371.84
vegetables

4367.12 --> 4374.4
then again i'm yeah i'm a guy

4371.84 --> 4376.64
and i'm not gay

4374.4 --> 4379.679
and i don't have a girlfriend if i would

4376.64 --> 4382.2390000000005
i'd probably eat more vegetables

4379.679 --> 4384.4800000000005
because they eat more vegetables and

4382.239 --> 4386.32
then i eat more vegetables because i'm

4384.48 --> 4388.718999999999
probably gonna end up cooking for them

4386.32 --> 4390.4
and so i'm gonna then cook vegetables

4388.719 --> 4393.12
that i'm gonna eat

4390.4 --> 4394.879999999999
see how that works

4393.12 --> 4396.08
i hate a lot more vegetables with my

4394.88 --> 4399.08
eggs

4396.08 --> 4399.08
but

4399.199 --> 4404.799999999999
but i'm a very intuitive eater so

4402.32 --> 4407.679
i'm really like almost like divining

4404.8 --> 4407.679
every like with a

4407.76 --> 4412.320000000001
like a water finding stick type of

4410.159 --> 4414.0
sensation just like this this is what i

4412.32 --> 4415.759999999999
need that's what i need and then i just

4414.0 --> 4417.92
get it right so

4415.76 --> 4420.4800000000005
in the last month i've been like yeah

4417.92 --> 4422.4
get tangerines just like no

4420.48 --> 4424.32
like before that

4422.4 --> 4426.159
they were just lying there i would never

4424.32 --> 4427.679
even think about it just wouldn't even

4426.159 --> 4429.839999999999
see that they're there and then at some

4427.679 --> 4430.88
point it was just like tangerines uh

4429.84 --> 4432.88
okay

4430.88 --> 4434.88
so now i kind of get a tangerine every

4432.88 --> 4437.76
day

4434.88 --> 4437.76
and it works great

4438.96 --> 4443.6
so

4440.48 --> 4445.759999999999
am i healthier on average

4443.6 --> 4447.92
than the average person well how would

4445.76 --> 4450.320000000001
you even compare that

4447.92 --> 4454.719
i mean i'm completely clear of any like

4450.32 --> 4456.5599999999995
serious pharmacological influences

4454.719 --> 4458.719
i don't i don't use

4456.56 --> 4458.719
like

4458.8 --> 4462.88
medicine from the medical systems like

4461.52 --> 4465.679
ever

4462.88 --> 4467.84
for a long time always avoid like

4465.679 --> 4470.0
including pain medication i don't take

4467.84 --> 4470.0
it

4471.84 --> 4477.84
and

4473.199 --> 4477.839999999999
i eat organic only i filter my water

4479.92 --> 4483.84
i stop drinking coffee even

4484.0 --> 4488.56
and sugar i take no more sugar in things

4486.64 --> 4490.8
never i still have the sugar i just

4488.56 --> 4492.4800000000005
don't use it now

4490.8 --> 4494.719
um

4492.48 --> 4497.28
i don't really

4494.719 --> 4499.52
eat candy except for a super salty stuff

4497.28 --> 4501.44
that just again by impulse it's just

4499.52 --> 4504.320000000001
like i gotta get this now i don't know

4501.44 --> 4505.839999999999
why i gotta get it now

4504.32 --> 4509.12
and that's not like continue it's not

4505.84 --> 4511.76
like every week i get a roll of lacrisal

4509.12 --> 4514.159
and just eat a lot of salt no no it just

4511.76 --> 4517.1990000000005
comes and goes

4514.159 --> 4517.199
very sporadically

4517.76 --> 4522.04
so no candy no cookies

4525.28 --> 4531.5199999999995
but a lot of my food that i typically

4527.92 --> 4534.96
eat consists of well french fries pizza

4531.52 --> 4538.719
hamburgers i'm not joking that's kind of

4534.96 --> 4541.04
what i eat mostly yeah

4538.719 --> 4544.08
except they're all organic

4541.04 --> 4546.239
i make the hamburgers completely myself

4544.08 --> 4548.96
with my own bread my own vegetables my

4546.239 --> 4551.5199999999995
own sauces

4548.96 --> 4554.56
pizzas i do get pre fat they're vegan

4551.52 --> 4556.56
type but they're pretty good

4554.56 --> 4559.76
like even like this kind of weird

4556.56 --> 4562.0
replacement cheese is pretty good

4559.76 --> 4563.92
and

4562.0 --> 4565.36
yeah french fries well it's organic

4563.92 --> 4567.6
french fries

4565.36 --> 4569.599999999999
olive oil

4567.6 --> 4573.120000000001
fried and

4569.6 --> 4575.4400000000005
that work seems to be working fine

4573.12 --> 4577.92
although i do have to like replace the

4575.44 --> 4580.0
oil periodically if it like

4577.92 --> 4584.0
keep on frying in the same oil for too

4580.0 --> 4584.0
long then it gets kind of bad

4587.84 --> 4592.4800000000005
no coffee you've gone too far need one

4590.0 --> 4595.52
cup in the morning yeah well i used to

4592.48 --> 4599.04
for a very long time

4595.52 --> 4600.320000000001
and then i quit i quit last year

4599.04 --> 4603.36
because

4600.32 --> 4606.719
it was literally just giving me stomach

4603.36 --> 4606.719
ache pretty bad

4607.28 --> 4612.8
i don't have that stomach anymore but i

4610.08 --> 4614.96
still have well stomach adjacent issues

4612.8 --> 4618.08
and that's where the idea that maybe

4614.96 --> 4620.64
something diabetic is going on but

4618.08 --> 4622.32
my healer insists that it isn't

4620.64 --> 4625.04
that this is just kind of like a

4622.32 --> 4626.799999999999
punishing conflict

4625.04 --> 4629.36
right and that's probably why i'm so

4626.8 --> 4632.320000000001
outraged even in my response to it is

4629.36 --> 4635.759999999999
because this is literally my past the

4632.32 --> 4640.08
punishment that i deserve for my [ __ ]

4635.76 --> 4640.08
ups in the past on a spiritual level

4642.88 --> 4647.4400000000005
because that's what it is

4645.04 --> 4649.6
that's like even where basically most

4647.44 --> 4651.759999999999
diseases come from

4649.6 --> 4654.96
so temporary weakness

4651.76 --> 4657.1990000000005
the resolve of a conflict usually

4654.96 --> 4659.04
grounded in a spiritual emotional

4657.199 --> 4661.28
experience

4659.04 --> 4662.159
and then when you resolve it when the

4661.28 --> 4664.639999999999
lock

4662.159 --> 4666.48
of the prison of that moment on your

4664.64 --> 4669.04
spirit comes off

4666.48 --> 4672.4
suddenly your body is basically

4669.04 --> 4673.679
subjected to its toxic influence

4672.4 --> 4676.32
something

4673.679 --> 4678.64
that might have been weakened will

4676.32 --> 4681.199
suddenly get more strained

4678.64 --> 4684.64
and then you get like pretty random

4681.199 --> 4689.199
inflammation it's like totally unrelated

4684.64 --> 4689.1990000000005
to an infection nothing it's just

4689.44 --> 4695.28
and it's literally painful and in the

4693.04 --> 4698.159
last

4695.28 --> 4702.48
week two weeks

4698.159 --> 4702.48
i've experienced a lot of pain

4703.92 --> 4710.96
so bad actually that like two days ago

4707.36 --> 4713.44
i literally threw up my dinner because

4710.96 --> 4716.0
the in my stomach being full was

4713.44 --> 4717.919999999999
literally aggravating it and it just

4716.0 --> 4720.0
couldn't handle it

4717.92 --> 4723.04
right and that's always in on an

4720.0 --> 4725.28
intuitive level a very bad sign

4723.04 --> 4727.28
when your stomach hurts

4725.28 --> 4731.04
that you throw up because of the pain

4727.28 --> 4731.04
that's always bad

4731.6 --> 4733.679
so

4732.56 --> 4735.679
yeah

4733.679 --> 4737.92
that kind of worries me but then in the

4735.679 --> 4739.76
same time i do trust german new medicine

4737.92 --> 4741.84
because i have no other freaking choice

4739.76 --> 4744.84
and i do kind of believe in it it's just

4741.84 --> 4744.84
that

4748.08 --> 4753.76
drives me up the wall

4751.199 --> 4753.759999999999
sometime

4759.6 --> 4764.8
is it the same where you live or just

4761.679 --> 4764.8
it's just amsterdam

4767.44 --> 4770.639999999999
i mean there's still plenty of coffee

4769.28 --> 4774.5599999999995
shops here but

4770.64 --> 4774.56
amsterdam is riddled with it

4775.36 --> 4777.839999999999
um

4791.84 --> 4794.84
anyway

4812.4 --> 4818.5599999999995
yeah sorry about basically barfing up my

4815.52 --> 4820.400000000001
entire emotional

4818.56 --> 4823.360000000001
content

4820.4 --> 4824.719
my personal frustration right in the

4823.36 --> 4827.199
out there

4824.719 --> 4827.199
earlier

4827.36 --> 4832.4
like literally it's literally like

4829.28 --> 4835.199
throwing up like i couldn't stop it

4832.4 --> 4839.44
i couldn't stop that

4835.199 --> 4841.839999999999
and it makes me kind of feel helpless

4839.44 --> 4845.04
because i don't want to do that

4841.84 --> 4849.12
i just couldn't stop it

4845.04 --> 4849.12
pain pain was too much

4859.36 --> 4861.839999999999
hmm

4876.159 --> 4882.239
the apollo day keeps the doctor away you

4878.48 --> 4882.239
know what also keeps the doctor away

4882.639 --> 4887.04
realizing that you don't need to go to a

4884.639 --> 4887.04
doctor

4887.12 --> 4890.92
to solve your issues

4915.04 --> 4920.719
probably the best coffee shops in

4917.92 --> 4922.56
amsterdam are you kidding me

4920.719 --> 4925.199
no

4922.56 --> 4927.84
but the coffee shops in the utrecht are

4925.199 --> 4927.839999999999
pretty good

4929.36 --> 4936.0
well the ones that i go to they they

4931.76 --> 4936.0
they pay attention to quality a lot

4939.44 --> 4943.879999999999
it is so no that's illegal

4945.28 --> 4949.759999999999
not rufus like

4947.76 --> 4951.679
mushrooms and all that

4949.76 --> 4954.719
that there's like separate types of

4951.679 --> 4957.12
shops where you can sort of get that

4954.719 --> 4959.84
or rather you get your own growing

4957.12 --> 4959.84
package

4960.159 --> 4964.638999999999
it's a bit complicated

4962.4 --> 4966.879999999999
but no not in coffee shops absolutely

4964.639 --> 4966.88
not

4967.679 --> 4973.28
do i have to check my what

4971.28 --> 4974.5599999999995
do i have to wait to check my blood

4973.28 --> 4977.599999999999
pressure yeah

4974.56 --> 4977.6
it's called doing this

4988.239 --> 4994.799999999999
that bike park place is crazy

4992.159 --> 4996.4
oh i think i know what you mean

4994.8 --> 5000.56
right

4996.4 --> 5002.719
is that crazy it looked pretty fun

5000.56 --> 5004.719
like if i was still like a teen or

5002.719 --> 5007.719
whatever that would look like a fun

5004.719 --> 5007.719
place

5014.159 --> 5019.96
yeah and how am i gonna show people i

5015.92 --> 5019.96
don't have a mobile

5046.4 --> 5051.5199999999995
felt helpless for me didn't know what to

5047.92 --> 5054.4
say well sorry ly young

5051.52 --> 5054.400000000001
really you cried

5054.84 --> 5059.679
that's

5056.56 --> 5059.679
sweet i guess

5060.239 --> 5063.44
cried really

5064.159 --> 5068.5599999999995
maybe you associated with the sensation

5066.88 --> 5070.4800000000005
i guess

5068.56 --> 5073.76
i mean i'm pretty sure i'm not the only

5070.48 --> 5077.28
one it's just that for me it's really

5073.76 --> 5079.4400000000005
because of the way my consciousness just

5077.28 --> 5081.36
zooms in on things

5079.44 --> 5084.4
for myself

5081.36 --> 5086.08
it's just

5084.4 --> 5089.08
i can't just put it away in the

5086.08 --> 5089.08
background

5103.92 --> 5110.8
and pastor drawn here well i in a way i

5106.8 --> 5113.84
hope so i am one like i am an empath i

5110.8 --> 5113.84
almost telepath

5115.52 --> 5121.6
or is that even almost it's like

5118.96 --> 5123.679
the way that i function and that i even

5121.6 --> 5125.1990000000005
seem to have like telepathic traits in

5123.679 --> 5127.1990000000005
ways

5125.199 --> 5129.199
made me convinced that the

5127.199 --> 5132.0
telepath that we've grown up with

5129.199 --> 5133.678999999999
through fictional stories and concepts

5132.0 --> 5135.6
sci-fi

5133.679 --> 5138.4
that that's actually just a fake

5135.6 --> 5140.8
replacement for the real telepathy that

5138.4 --> 5143.92
just exists

5140.8 --> 5145.04
that's like everything has that animals

5143.92 --> 5149.4
have that

5145.04 --> 5149.4
like animals have it a lot

5155.6 --> 5157.84
uh

5160.56 --> 5165.76
are spacecakes a real thing yeah not

5163.04 --> 5166.639
just in amsterdam like a lot of coffee

5165.76 --> 5170.0
shops

5166.639 --> 5171.36
like give or offer

5170.0 --> 5174.08
like

5171.36 --> 5175.12
hash brownies and all that kind of thing

5174.08 --> 5177.679
yeah

5175.12 --> 5177.679
lots of them

5180.96 --> 5183.84
not my thing though

5184.48 --> 5188.5199999999995
because there's sugar in it

5202.96 --> 5205.96
hmm

5213.36 --> 5219.32
has your sister has the evil eye what

5227.04 --> 5232.719
dogs who never bark bark at her

5230.639 --> 5234.639
that's weird i had that kind of a day

5232.719 --> 5237.52
yesterday

5234.639 --> 5239.1990000000005
yesterday i had a lot of tension i guess

5237.52 --> 5242.159000000001
that also came out with the flat earth

5239.199 --> 5245.199
debate against 10th when he

5242.159 --> 5245.199
pushed me too far

5246.0 --> 5252.639
but i was like really like

5250.239 --> 5255.44
carrying that stress a lot as i was

5252.639 --> 5257.04
basically outside getting groceries

5255.44 --> 5259.36
during the flat earth debates which i

5257.04 --> 5260.88
typically do during the show

5259.36 --> 5262.639
during the live show like the second

5260.88 --> 5264.32
half or something

5262.639 --> 5267.12
but

5264.32 --> 5268.08
like there were people out there and

5267.12 --> 5268.88
like

5268.08 --> 5271.76
and

5268.88 --> 5274.159000000001
multiple dogs would just start barking

5271.76 --> 5275.6
as they saw me approaching and they were

5274.159 --> 5277.759999999999
really like ah

5275.6 --> 5280.400000000001
and i'm like what the [ __ ] is going on

5277.76 --> 5283.280000000001
like they never do that but it was

5280.4 --> 5283.28
because i was so

5283.6 --> 5287.76
carrying this weight

5286.08 --> 5290.0
that they picked up on that and they got

5287.76 --> 5292.0
all aggressive

5290.0 --> 5295.84
it was weird

5292.0 --> 5295.84
that happened yesterday not today though

5306.56 --> 5312.159000000001
now right back diana troy level empath

5309.36 --> 5314.4
yeah me too

5312.159 --> 5316.638999999999
deanna troy was like one of the first

5314.4 --> 5318.0
characters that i was like that's who i

5316.639 --> 5320.56
am

5318.0 --> 5323.679
like that's what i do

5320.56 --> 5325.4400000000005
like oh she's like i was oh my god she's

5323.679 --> 5327.1990000000005
so lucky that she's just being

5325.44 --> 5330.96
recognized for the ability and that

5327.199 --> 5335.239
people actually just rely on her skill

5330.96 --> 5335.2390000000005
i was kind of jealous of her

5344.32 --> 5348.0
you missed fed what happened between

5346.239 --> 5350.4
10th and me that was during the after

5348.0 --> 5351.84
show steamy traveler and there was just

5350.4 --> 5354.32
a

5351.84 --> 5356.4800000000005
rough bump in i explained it at the

5354.32 --> 5359.36
start of this show i'm not gonna go

5356.48 --> 5359.36
through it all again

5363.6 --> 5368.8
get down on your knees and hold your

5365.76 --> 5372.719
palm up for dogs

5368.8 --> 5372.719
no i'm really good with dogs

5374.159 --> 5379.839999999999
like

5375.6 --> 5379.84
i'm not afraid of dogs not even big dogs

5380.719 --> 5384.08
anymore i used to kind of be when i was

5382.8 --> 5386.400000000001
younger

5384.08 --> 5390.0
but i'm like really not afraid of dogs

5386.4 --> 5392.5599999999995
anymore because i totally get them

5390.0 --> 5395.44
like and i can sense when they actually

5392.56 --> 5398.0
if they would actually go for like

5395.44 --> 5402.48
serious violent action and then i kind

5398.0 --> 5402.48
of can can respond in kind

5404.239 --> 5409.199
because i'm very quick and it could

5406.08 --> 5409.199
still be very quick

5410.639 --> 5415.4400000000005
i've had like situations like that in

5413.44 --> 5416.239
the past where dogs would literally like

5415.44 --> 5419.44
think

5416.239 --> 5421.759999999999
like of me like a prey run at me

5419.44 --> 5425.12
then i'd literally just perfectly time

5421.76 --> 5427.84
kicking them in the face really hard

5425.12 --> 5429.679
as they jump at me

5427.84 --> 5432.679
and then they don't come after me

5429.679 --> 5432.679
anymore

5443.44 --> 5449.919999999999
right i don't like doing that by the way

5446.88 --> 5451.92
because i usually just like really like

5449.92 --> 5454.159
dogs and especially when i'm like

5451.92 --> 5458.0
feeling really down

5454.159 --> 5460.32
there's some great such nice dogs

5458.0 --> 5462.239
they'll really like get

5460.32 --> 5465.84
on a spiritual level like get with you

5462.239 --> 5465.839999999999
and try to boost you up

5475.12 --> 5478.5599999999995
you raised the meanest dogs

5477.679 --> 5480.96
wow

5478.56 --> 5480.96
really

5481.12 --> 5484.4
you raised them to be mean

5484.719 --> 5487.719
why

5494.8 --> 5497.8
um

5523.12 --> 5529.04
more afraid of smaller dog ankle biters

5525.92 --> 5529.04
i'm not afraid of them

5530.88 --> 5535.6
but then again i have pretty good boots

5533.36 --> 5538.08
or at least for now that they're not

5535.6 --> 5540.2390000000005
completely disintegrated like these

5538.08 --> 5541.76
boots work pretty well against ankle

5540.239 --> 5545.48
biters

5541.76 --> 5545.4800000000005
it's like not problematic

5563.92 --> 5568.159
yeah that's correct you have gas head

5565.76 --> 5568.159000000001
they do

5572.48 --> 5576.32
yeah pretty much single-player gaming

5584.8 --> 5590.320000000001
now these are actually from england

5587.679 --> 5593.52
from the underground brand

5590.32 --> 5593.5199999999995
from correct ones

5593.76 --> 5598.52
sure now

5595.52 --> 5598.52
yeah

5603.44 --> 5607.44
but yeah i've been wearing those types

5605.199 --> 5609.759999999999
of shoes for like 20 years

5607.44 --> 5609.759999999999
straight

5610.239 --> 5617.4
not this particular pair of shoes by the

5612.719 --> 5617.4
way they don't last that long

5620.159 --> 5625.12
those are exactly the type of boots i

5622.239 --> 5629.08
picture well i guess that i'm fulfilling

5625.12 --> 5629.08
my image then

5638.4 --> 5642.0
no dampening in the soul no they do

5640.639 --> 5645.28
actually

5642.0 --> 5647.6
soul's pretty good well dampening

5645.28 --> 5650.32
there's a lot of rubber there

5647.6 --> 5654.56
but yeah look dude i've been

5650.32 --> 5654.5599999999995
these shoes are like severely worn

5654.639 --> 5661.1990000000005
like those soles were at least this

5657.04 --> 5661.199
thick at the start so

5667.36 --> 5670.08
like

5668.159 --> 5672.48
it's a miracle that these shoes haven't

5670.08 --> 5674.32
completely disintegrated yet

5672.48 --> 5677.28
right

5674.32 --> 5679.36
then again yeah i have to wear them for

5677.28 --> 5681.679
a long time because they're really

5679.36 --> 5684.32
expensive it's like

5681.679 --> 5687.56
80 or 90 euros

5684.32 --> 5687.5599999999995
a pair

5695.36 --> 5701.04
and i can't afford that at all like

5698.48 --> 5704.159
really at all

5701.04 --> 5704.159
[Music]

5705.36 --> 5712.159
still dealing with just

5707.92 --> 5715.76
freaking debts just general debts that i

5712.159 --> 5719.44
that are slowly growing

5715.76 --> 5719.4400000000005
still have to get by somehow

5719.84 --> 5725.52
so i'm just like wearing them out until

5722.96 --> 5727.44
literally they just fall apart and then

5725.52 --> 5731.400000000001
i'll see what the hell i'm gonna do then

5727.44 --> 5731.4
i don't know what i'm gonna do

5748.4 --> 5751.4
oh

5758.48 --> 5761.36
jeez

5760.239 --> 5764.32
okay

5761.36 --> 5768.28
that sounds terrible

5764.32 --> 5768.28
some harsh [ __ ]

5775.199 --> 5778.199
so

5793.52 --> 5799.320000000001
oh

5794.48 --> 5799.32
damn you have a full-blown channel

5799.36 --> 5804.239
huh

5801.28 --> 5804.239
didn't realize that

5805.04 --> 5808.88
so you kind of make music videos

5810.239 --> 5814.08
live performance that's that looks

5812.48 --> 5816.32
interesting

5814.08 --> 5816.32
huh

5818.8 --> 5822.1990000000005
right anyways

5832.4 --> 5835.4
um

5853.119 --> 5856.88
right so i think i'm calmed down a bit

5855.119 --> 5860.44
even though i'm still

5856.88 --> 5860.4400000000005
it's still aching

5879.92 --> 5883.52
wow that's rough leon

5894.159 --> 5897.839999999999
you had sweaty bombs

5912.88 --> 5916.88
right well anyway i look guys i hope i

5915.28 --> 5922.639
haven't like

5916.88 --> 5922.639
rubbed off my internal crap on you guys

5923.52 --> 5928.0
that

5924.56 --> 5930.4800000000005
that isn't the intention you see

5928.0 --> 5934.239
unless well no it doesn't work like that

5930.48 --> 5934.239
it's just my internal issue i

5936.32 --> 5940.88
guess it was just one of those days but

5938.4 --> 5942.32
yeah try to just enjoy the nice weather

5940.88 --> 5946.0
out there

5942.32 --> 5947.04
don't let irwin's tragic backstory in

5946.0 --> 5949.84
his own

5947.04 --> 5951.44
crazy conundrums and his inability to

5949.84 --> 5954.88
get

5951.44 --> 5958.239
or accept that all as a singular packet

5954.88 --> 5958.2390000000005
don't let that get you down

5962.96 --> 5967.84
[Music]

5964.96 --> 5967.84
right

5969.679 --> 5972.88
i'm still

5971.119 --> 5975.92
in the middle of just trying to figure

5972.88 --> 5975.92
out like what to do

5976.0 --> 5981.199
where to go and how to

5978.8 --> 5985.28
size up things because i just get the

5981.199 --> 5987.919999999999
feeling like i misjudged everything

5985.28 --> 5990.4
like i modeled it out

5987.92 --> 5992.08
in a fractal way in my head a long time

5990.4 --> 5992.839999999999
ago

5992.08 --> 5996.08
but

5992.84 --> 5998.639
everything did work like that

5996.08 --> 6000.639
but there were elements that i had left

5998.639 --> 6003.6
out and that's why everything is

6000.639 --> 6006.400000000001
basically wrong

6003.6 --> 6009.76
that's why it's not working out

6006.4 --> 6011.36
it could have if i hadn't left out these

6009.76 --> 6013.6
freaking elements

6011.36 --> 6015.839999999999
and i just don't understand why i did

6013.6 --> 6019.119000000001
that i don't understand why i thought

6015.84 --> 6021.04
that you could exclude

6019.119 --> 6024.159
parts of reality and that that would

6021.04 --> 6026.48
work i don't understand why it was that

6024.159 --> 6029.759999999999
freaking stupid and why nobody was

6026.48 --> 6029.759999999999
beating that out of me

6032.98 --> 6037.678999999999
[Music]

6035.6 --> 6040.2390000000005
because they should have but that's

6037.679 --> 6042.08
specifically not it's not about attitude

6040.239 --> 6044.32
it's about getting those [ __ ]

6042.08 --> 6048.48
delusions out of my head

6044.32 --> 6051.5199999999995
why did people leave those devastating

6048.48 --> 6054.4
illusions in me

6051.52 --> 6057.360000000001
basically like confessed

6054.4 --> 6060.0
things from my side even like no i just

6057.36 --> 6061.679
don't believe in that that doesn't exist

6060.0 --> 6064.639
to me

6061.679 --> 6069.8
for somebody with my intellect to leave

6064.639 --> 6069.8
that like that is a crime

6070.83 --> 6074.0289999999995
[Music]

6082.08 --> 6088.0
do i think i have taken the wrong path

6084.32 --> 6091.88
at some point you damn well sure i did

6088.0 --> 6091.88
i was freaking delusional

6094.96 --> 6099.44
pretty much from my teens on

6097.44 --> 6101.759999999999
pretty much from the first moment i

6099.44 --> 6103.36
realized like how [ __ ] up this world

6101.76 --> 6106.56
really is

6103.36 --> 6110.159
and i was literally as i was accepting

6106.56 --> 6112.159000000001
it unable to accept it and then

6110.159 --> 6114.48
this crazy

6112.159 --> 6117.199
world view came out of it with a whole

6114.48 --> 6119.44
range of delusions

6117.199 --> 6121.839999999999
thinking that

6119.44 --> 6121.839999999999
it's just

6122.88 --> 6128.639
like i had a dream and the dream is

6125.44 --> 6134.119
[ __ ] pointless and it doesn't work

6128.639 --> 6134.119
but i have a dream that sort of [ __ ]

6134.159 --> 6141.119
like an a more developed more advanced

6138.239 --> 6143.759999999999
social justice warrior idea that's not

6141.119 --> 6146.719
just full-blown [ __ ] and

6143.76 --> 6149.360000000001
like completely insane and double thing

6146.719 --> 6151.199
right because i was in my teens

6149.36 --> 6155.5199999999995
confronted with that

6151.199 --> 6155.5199999999995
they procured me to join them

6155.84 --> 6159.92
i

6156.8 --> 6162.56
kind of almost joined them and then i

6159.92 --> 6166.639
started to realize this is so [ __ ] up

6162.56 --> 6170.2390000000005
like like what what did i just do why am

6166.639 --> 6170.2390000000005
i associating with this

6173.92 --> 6178.0
and then

6174.96 --> 6180.8
my response was i'm i can make this

6178.0 --> 6184.44
better i can make a better form of this

6180.8 --> 6184.4400000000005
which is just

6206.159 --> 6209.679
who consider that a victory

6210.96 --> 6215.92
right yeah just like frodo getting

6213.52 --> 6217.92
stabbed with a more gold blade having to

6215.92 --> 6221.1990000000005
carry around his scar the rest of his

6217.92 --> 6223.84
natural life being a victory yeah if

6221.199 --> 6226.879999999999
it's a victory in that sense yeah

6223.84 --> 6226.88
that was a victory

6228.4 --> 6235.36
not a loss are you kidding me

6232.8 --> 6237.92
not a loss or punishment

6235.36 --> 6237.92
really

6239.679 --> 6245.76
i unleashed my spirit upon the concept

6243.84 --> 6248.96
i like

6245.76 --> 6252.52
my dark world vision is partially based

6248.96 --> 6252.52
on that crap

6285.6 --> 6289.84
you really want to understand yeah so do

6287.76 --> 6289.84
i

6293.04 --> 6298.56
what i'm trying to tell you is when when

6295.28 --> 6301.679
the vision thing happened

6298.56 --> 6303.6
i was effectively

6301.679 --> 6305.119
my own

6303.6 --> 6306.400000000001
sjw

6305.119 --> 6307.839999999999
format

6306.4 --> 6310.48
and it was

6307.84 --> 6311.4400000000005
freaking insane trust me

6310.48 --> 6314.879999999999
not

6311.44 --> 6316.4
bad insane but insane

6314.88 --> 6319.52
and ineffective

6316.4 --> 6319.5199999999995
and illogical

6322.4 --> 6328.159
it

6324.239 --> 6331.28
it's just the thing that i wish just

6328.159 --> 6333.92
i just wish it never happened i really

6331.28 --> 6333.92
really do

6336.56 --> 6340.96
which dark world vision i speak of

6339.119 --> 6342.88
the entire thing

6340.96 --> 6344.719
the 80 years

6342.88 --> 6347.92
everything

6344.719 --> 6347.92
it's all part of that

6354.96 --> 6359.92
just be a warrior you're right

6356.96 --> 6362.2390000000005
yeah well i worry a lot so

6359.92 --> 6362.2390000000005
yeah

6363.36 --> 6368.0
although

6364.8 --> 6370.08
dream walking is kind of the way that i

6368.0 --> 6373.48
do a lot of things now and that is a

6370.08 --> 6373.48
form of worrying

6380.56 --> 6387.0
you wish you could look at my mind see

6382.56 --> 6387.0
what i see no it's terrible

6393.199 --> 6398.96
i mean i really like it guys when i say

6396.639 --> 6400.56
80 years of torture

6398.96 --> 6402.719
that's not

6400.56 --> 6406.2390000000005
like a saying

6402.719 --> 6408.639
it's quite literal like even tapping

6406.239 --> 6412.08
into it is like tapping into a

6408.639 --> 6415.4400000000005
nightmarish state of mind

6412.08 --> 6418.5599999999995
and even being just resonating with that

6415.44 --> 6420.96
frequency pulls me back into that

6418.56 --> 6423.360000000001
garbage it creates

6420.96 --> 6426.88
like a psychotic rift

6423.36 --> 6429.199
if i tap into it too long

6426.88 --> 6432.08
it's a state of mind i just never want

6429.199 --> 6435.759999999999
to be like i just wish it never happened

6432.08 --> 6439.159
i really do i really really wish it

6435.76 --> 6439.159000000001
never happened

6454.4 --> 6457.4
uh

6478.88 --> 6481.119
what

6481.28 --> 6486.32
when you're lucid dreaming don't look in

6483.119 --> 6486.32
a mirror that's weird

6486.48 --> 6489.44
that's really odd

6495.76 --> 6500.320000000001
if you could create an alternative yeah

6498.0 --> 6504.08
i'm trying and trying steamy traveler

6500.32 --> 6504.08
i'm literally trying to do that

6505.52 --> 6510.400000000001
i i can't think of anything anymore you

6508.8 --> 6514.56
see

6510.4 --> 6514.5599999999995
i don't know how to fix this anymore

6521.44 --> 6526.0
the picture in my mind every time i

6523.76 --> 6529.280000000001
start conjuring there's only a

6526.0 --> 6531.6
preliminary a suggestion of good then my

6529.28 --> 6532.639
mind actually immediately takes a hold

6531.6 --> 6534.88
of that

6532.639 --> 6538.84
and then zones in on what's actually

6534.88 --> 6542.92
gonna happen and it always turns to

6538.84 --> 6542.92
[ __ ] always

6555.44 --> 6559.119
and i'm like

6557.04 --> 6562.96
facing that kind of [ __ ]

6559.119 --> 6565.28
all the time and then i'm like okay so

6562.96 --> 6567.679
what terrible habit are you going to

6565.28 --> 6569.759999999999
have to struggle with for the next five

6567.679 --> 6572.56
to ten years

6569.76 --> 6575.360000000001
to ensure that that one little moment

6572.56 --> 6578.080000000001
that's gonna ruin the perfect moment

6575.36 --> 6580.239
is like destroyed forever that that's

6578.08 --> 6582.48
never able to happen again because you

6580.239 --> 6586.239
literally disciplined

6582.48 --> 6590.159
that entire detailed terrible habit

6586.239 --> 6592.638999999999
out of you which is a very big struggle

6590.159 --> 6597.839999999999
that takes a long time and it's purely

6592.639 --> 6597.84
internal it's like dedication like real

6601.52 --> 6606.56
it's how i've built myself up but i

6603.84 --> 6608.719
still can't

6606.56 --> 6610.96
i can't

6608.719 --> 6612.0
i've built myself up in the way that i

6610.96 --> 6615.199
am

6612.0 --> 6615.199
i can do what i do

6616.32 --> 6621.04
but i can't

6617.84 --> 6625.2390000000005
get out of this position

6621.04 --> 6625.239
it doesn't work like that

6627.679 --> 6633.04
it's like the only way that it work is

6629.76 --> 6634.8
literally just throw it all away all of

6633.04 --> 6637.44
it

6634.8 --> 6639.76
everything my ability

6637.44 --> 6641.44
my vision my inside what i thought that

6639.76 --> 6643.52
i could do what i thought that was

6641.44 --> 6645.598999999999
important

6643.52 --> 6648.280000000001
my independence

6645.599 --> 6653.84
my dependence all of it just

6648.28 --> 6653.84
absolutely everything erased forever

6654.96 --> 6660.88
like all of it flat earth

6657.84 --> 6663.28
oh my dual cosmic gun all my signs

6660.88 --> 6666.28
exploit everything all of it erased

6663.28 --> 6666.28
forever

6666.719 --> 6671.599
i feel sometimes that even just wanting

6669.52 --> 6673.76
those things as part of what i do here

6671.599 --> 6676.88
with my show that that is the thing that

6673.76 --> 6680.8
is actually causing the hell

6676.88 --> 6682.88
because i'm digging in places

6680.8 --> 6685.360000000001
that are just like

6682.88 --> 6688.32
forbidden it's information that people

6685.36 --> 6691.199
don't like all mass don't actually want

6688.32 --> 6692.88
to know they might think they do but

6691.199 --> 6696.48
they don't understand like the

6692.88 --> 6700.84
punishment of knowledge in itself

6696.48 --> 6700.839999999999
not from the world from god

6741.119 --> 6745.0
right let's just

6769.84 --> 6772.84
so

6780.719 --> 6785.679
there's freedom letting go of the popes

6783.36 --> 6788.0
that's no problem it's already it's just

6785.679 --> 6788.0
that

6789.52 --> 6794.8
right

6791.28 --> 6797.119
if in the past you carved something into

6794.8 --> 6797.119000000001
rock

6797.52 --> 6801.679
yeah you can let go of the past but that

6799.92 --> 6804.0
freaking carving is still there and

6801.679 --> 6805.36
whatever you're gonna do that carving is

6804.0 --> 6807.36
there

6805.36 --> 6809.839999999999
yeah there's some things about the past

6807.36 --> 6812.88
that you can't let go you can't let go

6809.84 --> 6812.88
how it formed you

6819.44 --> 6824.08
right if

6821.04 --> 6826.0
yeah sometimes remembering even terrible

6824.08 --> 6827.84
things is actually the thing that you

6826.0 --> 6829.84
build on

6827.84 --> 6832.639
that you build your

6829.84 --> 6835.92
mechanisms on your internal energy and

6832.639 --> 6837.84
social mechanisms are built on

6835.92 --> 6839.92
your history what you know about

6837.84 --> 6842.08
yourself from the past you can't just

6839.92 --> 6843.52
like blank it out

6842.08 --> 6845.84
because that would mean you'd have to

6843.52 --> 6849.599
like start anew even though all the

6845.84 --> 6852.56
pathways have already been taken

6849.599 --> 6854.56
like what are you gonna grow anew with

6852.56 --> 6857.599
it's already taken you're just now

6854.56 --> 6857.599
blanking it out

6858.0 --> 6862.28
it's it

6858.96 --> 6862.28
doesn't work

6886.4 --> 6891.119
right leon yeah sure that

6888.719 --> 6893.36
yeah doing stuff sure it'll keep you

6891.119 --> 6897.199
busy that's fine

6893.36 --> 6897.199
i have some things to keep me busy

6899.28 --> 6902.88
i mean i'll i'll somehow survive all

6902.08 --> 6906.0
this

6902.88 --> 6907.36
i think although sometimes when the pain

6906.0 --> 6911.28
is like

6907.36 --> 6913.5199999999995
pretty bad then i think like am i then

6911.28 --> 6916.239
guys i don't want to say it i really

6913.52 --> 6919.4400000000005
don't but i honestly think at such

6916.239 --> 6921.598999999999
moments am i finally gonna die now

6919.44 --> 6924.48
is this [ __ ] finally over am i finally

6921.599 --> 6924.4800000000005
gonna die now

6925.28 --> 6929.48
that's what i think sometimes

6934.159 --> 6939.119
because when it's that painful you just

6936.48 --> 6941.28
can't see the good things anymore

6939.119 --> 6944.159
you just can't see it you can't see the

6941.28 --> 6946.5599999999995
detail beauty you can't see it

6944.159 --> 6948.879999999999
can't look outside and actually enjoy it

6946.56 --> 6950.2390000000005
because all you're seeing is like

6948.88 --> 6954.08
that's beauty

6950.239 --> 6956.239
this is pain that's beauty this is pain

6954.08 --> 6959.719
it's there's nothing you can do when

6956.239 --> 6959.718999999999
you're like that

6970.639 --> 6973.96
your amish

6974.15 --> 6978.4
[Applause]

6975.76 --> 6980.719
maybe amisha jason because if you'd be

6978.4 --> 6982.0
amish you you wouldn't be on youtube you

6980.719 --> 6985.639
wouldn't even have a computer you

6982.0 --> 6985.639
wouldn't even have electricity

6988.239 --> 6993.159
maybe it's more mormon

6990.159 --> 6993.159
adjacent

7002.0 --> 7005.119
write backwards

7005.52 --> 7007.76
what

7011.76 --> 7019.04
what how does that work

7014.96 --> 7022.599
you mean you're right from

7019.04 --> 7022.599
right to left

7036.48 --> 7040.08
make music when you're miserable yeah

7040.719 --> 7045.2390000000005
so i did my parents by the way a lot

7056.96 --> 7063.52
over the fence gym jump oh right the way

7060.239 --> 7065.919999999999
to order your language and that's not

7063.52 --> 7067.679
really backwards that's just another

7065.92 --> 7069.599
arrangement right

7067.679 --> 7070.96
is that typically amish i didn't know

7069.599 --> 7073.679
that

7070.96 --> 7074.719
it's kind of old-fashioned i guess

7073.679 --> 7077.679
all right there's nothing wrong with

7074.719 --> 7079.84
that it's a little yoda speak

7077.679 --> 7083.719
little not fully

7079.84 --> 7083.719
yoda overdoes that

7090.0 --> 7093.28
play video game yeah that's what i do

7091.84 --> 7096.84
too

7093.28 --> 7096.84
a lot of the time

7104.239 --> 7110.32
arabic is written right to left okay

7108.0 --> 7113.96
right that's actually the language is

7110.32 --> 7113.96
written like that yeah

7140.4 --> 7143.4
hmm

7193.84 --> 7200.32
true nature of the world is suffering i

7196.48 --> 7202.32
don't know about that flatter sage but

7200.32 --> 7206.08
unless you mean the true

7202.32 --> 7206.08
purpose of the world is suffering

7206.159 --> 7210.5599999999995
then i'd say yeah probable

7211.36 --> 7217.28
but suffering is not like the nature of

7214.0 --> 7219.44
it it's just like what happens and

7217.28 --> 7221.44
kind of the purpose right there's a

7219.44 --> 7223.44
purpose to suffering

7221.44 --> 7228.239
for the spirit

7223.44 --> 7228.239
for what the spirit does with the world

7229.679 --> 7235.599
it's not automatic suffering can be

7232.48 --> 7237.839999999999
avoided you see that is kind of

7235.599 --> 7240.400000000001
possible too but with consequences for

7237.84 --> 7244.159000000001
the spirit so i wouldn't say the nature

7240.4 --> 7248.08
is suffering but it is a purpose

7244.159 --> 7250.239
that's like for the spirit ugh

7248.08 --> 7252.4
although yeah it's all really nice

7250.239 --> 7254.959999999999
talkings really nice theoretics but when

7252.4 --> 7257.199
you're actually suffering

7254.96 --> 7259.76
my response to that wisdom is go [ __ ]

7257.199 --> 7261.5199999999995
yourself

7259.76 --> 7263.599
you try it

7261.52 --> 7265.52
see if you still think oh it's so good

7263.599 --> 7267.1990000000005
oh it's oh it deserves the purpose yeah

7265.52 --> 7271.88
well when you're actually in it you're

7267.199 --> 7271.879999999999
just like kenda's [ __ ] end already

7282.56 --> 7285.56
ugh

7305.199 --> 7311.5199999999995
this is self-made prison flat earth what

7308.719 --> 7315.599
right anyway

7311.52 --> 7315.599
man i've been going for for a while

7319.119 --> 7323.08
full two hours already

7334.8 --> 7339.679
no freaking one could help me

7337.36 --> 7343.119
or at least i was convinced of it i'm

7339.679 --> 7345.04
not convinced of it it's just that

7343.119 --> 7347.44
i just wanted to emphasize what i just

7345.04 --> 7350.56
said is that that wisdom

7347.44 --> 7352.638999999999
it works when you're good

7350.56 --> 7354.4800000000005
because then you have like the sensories

7352.639 --> 7357.4400000000005
available to actually

7354.48 --> 7359.678999999999
feel out how that is real right but when

7357.44 --> 7362.638999999999
you're in the pain then everything is

7359.679 --> 7365.119
like closed off so it just doesn't help

7362.639 --> 7365.119
anything

7365.28 --> 7368.639
when you're actually in it

7369.28 --> 7373.679
of course people can help you

7371.28 --> 7375.04
it's like without that there would be

7373.679 --> 7376.08
nothing

7375.04 --> 7378.639
like i

7376.08 --> 7381.36
literally would not i probably wouldn't

7378.639 --> 7384.08
be alive

7381.36 --> 7386.159
if i didn't have ha if i hadn't had all

7384.08 --> 7387.92
the help throughout my life that i did

7386.159 --> 7389.92
even from people

7387.92 --> 7391.4400000000005
that in retrospect i think are pretty

7389.92 --> 7394.639
horrible people

7391.44 --> 7397.839999999999
but even they at moments just helped me

7394.639 --> 7397.84
when i really needed it

7398.08 --> 7403.679
and it's really weird

7400.8 --> 7403.679
realizing that

7406.8 --> 7412.159000000001
opening my own healer businesses

7409.92 --> 7412.159
no

7413.28 --> 7416.88
well

7414.56 --> 7418.159000000001
maybe if i like survive the next 10

7416.88 --> 7420.8
years

7418.159 --> 7423.839999999999
rufus saint hobbits but i don't know how

7420.8 --> 7423.84
to do what he does

7424.159 --> 7428.159
i'm

7425.119 --> 7430.639
like only sporadically learning how to

7428.159 --> 7433.598999999999
do what he does to me

7430.639 --> 7437.4400000000005
myself on myself

7433.599 --> 7439.92
it's it's tough i'm not used to it it's

7437.44 --> 7442.5599999999995
like he's been doing that for like 50

7439.92 --> 7445.1990000000005
years or something

7442.56 --> 7448.0
he's very practiced

7445.199 --> 7449.5199999999995
and he hasn't like he's completely

7448.0 --> 7451.92
absorbed

7449.52 --> 7455.679
all of that rudolf steiner information

7451.92 --> 7455.679
and insight and that way of being

7455.76 --> 7460.4800000000005
he's not like a that somebody that's

7458.0 --> 7462.639
like widely grasped everything and

7460.48 --> 7465.598999999999
sampled everything including the bad

7462.639 --> 7469.28
things like kind of i have

7465.599 --> 7471.28
so i don't know if i can be like that

7469.28 --> 7474.239
it would definitely be great to be able

7471.28 --> 7476.5599999999995
to do that but i don't know if what i am

7474.239 --> 7479.799999999999
actually allows to become exactly what

7476.56 --> 7479.8
he is

7484.159 --> 7488.4
like his life is just very different

7486.48 --> 7490.0
from mine also by the way he used to be

7488.4 --> 7492.5599999999995
a doctor

7490.0 --> 7494.639
then he quit

7492.56 --> 7496.96
and that's like even before corona and

7494.639 --> 7496.96
all that

7499.04 --> 7503.36
was it 2005 he said

7503.599 --> 7507.679
he stepped out

7504.84 --> 7510.400000000001
because as a practitioner he was

7507.679 --> 7511.679
basically just being open about well

7510.4 --> 7513.598999999999
alternative

7511.679 --> 7514.56
things like german new medicine and all

7513.599 --> 7517.119000000001
that

7514.56 --> 7520.159000000001
and then yeah the board the medical

7517.119 --> 7522.079
board gave him a hassle about it

7520.159 --> 7525.92
basically said like you can't do that

7522.079 --> 7528.48
anymore and he was like go [ __ ] yourself

7525.92 --> 7531.76
i'll just do it on my own then

7528.48 --> 7533.839999999999
which is like really

7531.76 --> 7535.76
really super base that he actually did

7533.84 --> 7539.28
that and the funny thing was is that

7535.76 --> 7542.2390000000005
after he did that he actually got more

7539.28 --> 7543.5199999999995
more people that signed up

7542.239 --> 7546.879999999999
with him

7543.52 --> 7548.639
just not as an official doctor

7546.88 --> 7552.4800000000005
to basically do what he still does now

7548.639 --> 7552.4800000000005
and he's so incredibly good at it

7555.76 --> 7562.1990000000005
who in your life now gives you help what

7570.639 --> 7574.32
i don't know

7572.32 --> 7575.84
you guys

7574.32 --> 7578.239
you give me help

7575.84 --> 7581.28
ideas

7578.239 --> 7581.28
financial support

7581.36 --> 7584.719
patience

7583.36 --> 7588.0
with me and

7584.719 --> 7591.52
also willingness to actually learn like

7588.0 --> 7593.44
you're my mirror in a way

7591.52 --> 7596.320000000001
if you guys weren't actually paying

7593.44 --> 7598.079
attention on a very close level

7596.32 --> 7600.4
including emotional

7598.079 --> 7602.0
then i wouldn't have a proper mirror to

7600.4 --> 7604.079
reflect

7602.0 --> 7605.199
whether what i'm doing is even a real

7604.079 --> 7606.079
thing

7605.199 --> 7607.5199999999995
really

7606.079 --> 7608.639
what it yeah

7607.52 --> 7610.159000000001
that i'm even

7608.639 --> 7611.52
if you guys wouldn't have been here i

7610.159 --> 7614.879999999999
wouldn't even know if i'd be an

7611.52 --> 7614.88
effective teacher or not

7616.079 --> 7620.799999999999
it's only because

7617.52 --> 7624.719
your reflections that basically prove to

7620.8 --> 7624.719
me that i'm doing a good thing

7625.52 --> 7630.639
and that's very helpful

7628.4 --> 7633.44
that makes me feel well at least i'm not

7630.639 --> 7635.28
completely wasting absolutely everything

7633.44 --> 7638.48
about my life

7635.28 --> 7638.48
at least i'm doing this

7640.719 --> 7646.4800000000005
and of course at least i'm being honest

7643.04 --> 7648.8
and like inconveniently very unmedia

7646.48 --> 7651.759999999999
trained wise honest

7648.8 --> 7651.76
and that's just what i do

7653.199 --> 7657.44
part of a psychological study i guess

7658.239 --> 7663.199
for myself and for others who are

7660.48 --> 7666.239
interested in i guess personality types

7663.199 --> 7666.239
that match mine

7668.159 --> 7672.239
because what the [ __ ] do you do with

7670.0 --> 7674.639
people like me right what the [ __ ] do

7672.239 --> 7677.44
you do with that

7674.639 --> 7679.4400000000005
it's very complicated most people like

7677.44 --> 7681.199
literally are like i don't know what to

7679.44 --> 7682.799999999999
do with you

7681.199 --> 7685.839999999999
i mean

7682.8 --> 7688.4800000000005
kind of stare at you maybe

7685.84 --> 7690.639
wonder inside what are the aspects like

7688.48 --> 7692.4
or how would they respond yeah but most

7690.639 --> 7694.400000000001
people they don't do anything with

7692.4 --> 7697.759999999999
people like me

7694.4 --> 7700.0
just kind of stare a bit like bewildered

7697.76 --> 7700.0
or

7700.32 --> 7704.4
sometimes it's even like dave yeah i

7702.719 --> 7706.639
don't want to go there

7704.4 --> 7708.0
they have weird natural responses from

7706.639 --> 7709.76
people

7708.0 --> 7711.84
very weird

7709.76 --> 7714.4800000000005
i think some may have like pretty

7711.84 --> 7715.360000000001
incredible fantasies about who i really

7714.48 --> 7717.678999999999
am

7715.36 --> 7719.839999999999
that they completely keep to themselves

7717.679 --> 7722.2390000000005
because they're used to kind of dwelling

7719.84 --> 7724.0
upon things like that in delusion within

7722.239 --> 7726.638999999999
themselves for a long time a lot of

7724.0 --> 7728.719
people do that

7726.639 --> 7730.4800000000005
so i think that i'm probably with who i

7728.719 --> 7732.32
am how i am and everything that i've

7730.48 --> 7733.919999999999
said and like the intensity i've set

7732.32 --> 7736.639
things with

7733.92 --> 7738.56
people catch on to that they're gonna

7736.639 --> 7741.4400000000005
probably have a whole bunch of weird

7738.56 --> 7741.4400000000005
ideas about me

7741.92 --> 7746.639
beyond just how weird i really am

7747.04 --> 7751.44
and sometimes i have a whole bunch of

7748.719 --> 7755.36
weird ideas about mia too

7751.44 --> 7757.44
which was partially the problem

7755.36 --> 7760.159
when i was younger and the whole vision

7757.44 --> 7760.159
[ __ ] happened

7764.639 --> 7769.04
no one out there other than cyberspace

7767.04 --> 7770.96
support neighbors

7769.04 --> 7772.96
well we have a good understand like

7770.96 --> 7773.92
i'm good with my neighbors they know who

7772.96 --> 7777.599
i am

7773.92 --> 7780.2390000000005
i'm always like helpful

7777.599 --> 7781.76
i don't really know them

7780.239 --> 7783.919999999999
i mean there's one

7781.76 --> 7785.84
neighbor guy that's pretty cool i i went

7783.92 --> 7787.4400000000005
over to him and like had a beer and

7785.84 --> 7789.28
listened to some music and we had a

7787.44 --> 7791.199
whole discussion about christianity and

7789.28 --> 7792.32
flat earth

7791.199 --> 7796.0
right

7792.32 --> 7796.0
that's pretty much as far as i've come

7796.239 --> 7800.799999999999
and my roommates they they know a little

7798.96 --> 7802.56
about where i stand and what i'm dealing

7800.8 --> 7804.4800000000005
with

7802.56 --> 7806.400000000001
especially the cute one that's by the

7804.48 --> 7808.48
way staying

7806.4 --> 7810.638999999999
staying over for the weekend

7808.48 --> 7811.759999999999
in the coming months or so is it yeah

7810.639 --> 7813.599
who knows

7811.76 --> 7816.320000000001
i'll really like her but she's she's

7813.599 --> 7816.32
very smart

7817.04 --> 7821.199
and i've

7818.079 --> 7822.96
laid down a whole bunch of like my my my

7821.199 --> 7825.199
struggle

7822.96 --> 7827.679
in life and with the world and

7825.199 --> 7830.0
my stan where i stand she knows that she

7827.679 --> 7832.159
knows where i stand

7830.0 --> 7834.48
she knows i'm like a warrior against

7832.159 --> 7837.839999999999
like the lies in the world and that i

7834.48 --> 7837.839999999999
take it very serious

7839.04 --> 7845.36
and that i'm not like out of control

7841.76 --> 7845.360000000001
or just an attention seeker

7853.679 --> 7857.84
generally if you're cool with being an

7855.52 --> 7860.4800000000005
outsider weirdo people just leave you

7857.84 --> 7864.0
alone yeah that's right

7860.48 --> 7866.079
yeah that's kind of what i describe

7864.0 --> 7867.599
they leave you alone but they will

7866.079 --> 7869.84
probably like

7867.599 --> 7872.0
have a glimpse at you and then like

7869.84 --> 7873.92
think about like what is that person

7872.0 --> 7875.04
like

7873.92 --> 7878.079
right

7875.04 --> 7878.079
i get that a lot

7879.599 --> 7883.96
did i flat smack her

7884.239 --> 7888.4
i don't remember i don't think so

7893.679 --> 7900.0
but i wouldn't be surprised if she'd be

7895.76 --> 7903.52
very open up to it she seems like a

7900.0 --> 7905.599
like a really naturally dynamic flexible

7903.52 --> 7908.079000000001
person with ideas

7905.599 --> 7911.04
as in it doesn't seem like anything you

7908.079 --> 7913.199
could say would actually face her

7911.04 --> 7915.84
just interesting a bit weird

7913.199 --> 7918.239
i don't know might have a bit of

7915.84 --> 7918.2390000000005
i don't know

7920.96 --> 7926.4800000000005
but she's like very dynamic

7924.079 --> 7928.639
she probably has that typical female

7926.48 --> 7930.879999999999
trait where they basically tolerate more

7928.639 --> 7932.639
than they should

7930.88 --> 7935.119
right and then afterward they make up

7932.639 --> 7937.1990000000005
their mind about it so you could

7935.119 --> 7939.04
probably like go completely out of

7937.199 --> 7941.44
control ballistic

7939.04 --> 7944.079
like very anti-social with her and she

7941.44 --> 7947.839999999999
would probably just let you do that

7944.079 --> 7949.92
and then afterward be like okay i'm not

7947.84 --> 7951.92
like by the way this is the last time

7949.92 --> 7955.36
we're gonna see each other

7951.92 --> 7958.639
right she's that type i think

7955.36 --> 7960.239
is she intelligent oh yeah

7958.639 --> 7965.1990000000005
i don't know if she's like super

7960.239 --> 7965.199
brilliant but she is pretty damn smart

7965.28 --> 7968.719
and she especially just has a lot of

7967.52 --> 7970.719
room

7968.719 --> 7971.599
she has a lot of development room in her

7970.719 --> 7975.119
head

7971.599 --> 7978.32
she is studying for a doctor

7975.119 --> 7982.04
you got to be pretty smart just to

7978.32 --> 7982.04
just to go for that

7985.92 --> 7990.88
i really like talking with her about

7987.92 --> 7993.84
medical things by the way

7990.88 --> 7997.4400000000005
because i can kind of talk like i as if

7993.84 --> 8000.4800000000005
i'm like a bit of a medical snob

7997.44 --> 8002.4
but i do like know a lot of thingies

8000.48 --> 8004.5599999999995
about the system even though i'm not

8002.4 --> 8006.879999999999
actually a doc i know a lot about what's

8004.56 --> 8008.88
going on what they deal with

8006.88 --> 8010.96
and i can kind of like

8008.88 --> 8014.2390000000005
share a lot of these like

8010.96 --> 8016.719
far ahead details with her like oh

8014.239 --> 8018.718999999999
did you know that like medical protocols

8016.719 --> 8020.639
are actually a big problem and people

8018.719 --> 8022.84
follow them and actually don't really

8020.639 --> 8025.76
understand why that protocol is even

8022.84 --> 8027.599
there like to give her awareness about

8025.76 --> 8028.96
those types of things i i have already

8027.599 --> 8031.76
talked about that

8028.96 --> 8034.159
because i knew like there's the

8031.76 --> 8036.159000000001
the coronu protocols that were actually

8034.159 --> 8039.839999999999
just getting people killed

8036.159 --> 8039.839999999999
so i informed her about that

8040.079 --> 8045.199
and she did

8042.079 --> 8046.96
accept that that that was an issue

8045.199 --> 8049.839999999999
it's not like she let me just blah blah

8046.96 --> 8051.52
blah blah no she actually was like yeah

8049.84 --> 8054.32
that's messed up

8051.52 --> 8054.320000000001
i'll be careful

8063.84 --> 8068.0
right

8065.52 --> 8070.96
but anyway i yeah

8068.0 --> 8070.96
we'll see what happens

8071.84 --> 8076.4800000000005
i mean if i get a a good friend out of

8074.56 --> 8077.4400000000005
her i'd already be very happy although

8076.48 --> 8080.5599999999995
i'd

8077.44 --> 8083.839999999999
definitely be up for more

8080.56 --> 8083.84
but i don't know if she is

8093.119 --> 8095.759999999999
as far as i know she still has a

8094.56 --> 8098.76
boyfriend

8095.76 --> 8098.76
so

8111.36 --> 8118.44
anyway i'm gonna round out the show

8113.599 --> 8118.4400000000005
and this has gone on long enough

8123.119 --> 8128.239
all right

8124.4 --> 8130.4
so yeah it's been quite a

8128.239 --> 8131.759999999999
bit of an emotional breakdown show i

8130.4 --> 8133.36
guess

8131.76 --> 8137.84
yeah it was

8133.36 --> 8137.839999999999
i did definitely emotionally break down

8140.88 --> 8146.079
it's also i think sometimes because

8144.079 --> 8148.719
i don't really know anybody out there

8146.079 --> 8151.44
that i can share this with like this

8148.719 --> 8153.599
would be really typically the thing i

8151.44 --> 8155.44
guess that most people if they have like

8153.599 --> 8157.599
issues like this

8155.44 --> 8160.079
they'd probably like try to go to like

8157.599 --> 8161.599
or a friend that they could nag about it

8160.079 --> 8163.599
forever they would actually be willing

8161.599 --> 8166.32
to hear them out

8163.599 --> 8168.639
or a psychologer

8166.32 --> 8169.84
although yeah that might be expensive i

8168.639 --> 8173.4400000000005
don't know

8169.84 --> 8173.4400000000005
their social worker or something

8173.52 --> 8177.679
i don't really have

8175.44 --> 8179.759999999999
like enough

8177.679 --> 8182.56
i don't like have somebody to do that

8179.76 --> 8184.88
with at the moment

8182.56 --> 8187.360000000001
except for my healer a little but yeah

8184.88 --> 8190.159000000001
it doesn't like have the

8187.36 --> 8191.28
time time to talk hours or something

8190.159 --> 8193.439
right

8191.28 --> 8195.519
15 minutes 20 minutes at best and then

8193.439 --> 8196.479000000001
he has to move on because he's very busy

8195.519 --> 8199.519
guy

8196.479 --> 8199.519
getting a lot of calls

8205.679 --> 8209.12
so yeah then i kind of end up doing it

8208.24 --> 8210.559
here

8209.12 --> 8213.2
right in front of all of you and the

8210.559 --> 8216.08
trolls and all of it

8213.2 --> 8220.0
they can have their squirty moment

8216.08 --> 8221.12
and we all dive into the deep of our

8220.0 --> 8224.559
like

8221.12 --> 8226.319000000001
less proud areas of representation i

8224.559 --> 8229.96
guess

8226.319 --> 8229.96
and get more honest

8235.84 --> 8239.12
all right yeah

8237.12 --> 8242.960000000001
i appreciate you appreciate that voters

8239.12 --> 8242.960000000001
boy it is kind of my thing i guess

8244.16 --> 8248.399
maybe try a journal

8246.16 --> 8251.119999999999
that's so funny it's so funny that you

8248.399 --> 8253.76
mentioned that rubber digital because my

8251.12 --> 8255.76
parents were actually recommending me

8253.76 --> 8257.679
to do that when i was a teen it just

8255.76 --> 8258.559000000001
didn't work

8257.679 --> 8260.0
this

8258.559 --> 8262.639
however

8260.0 --> 8267.359
effectively is my journal

8262.639 --> 8268.08
since i have a daily show i do it anyway

8267.359 --> 8271.04
so

8268.08 --> 8273.84
yeah this is kind of my journal

8271.04 --> 8276.639000000001
my flat earth early bird show journal

8273.84 --> 8279.439
and i share everything in it

8276.639 --> 8281.598999999998
personal things

8279.439 --> 8284.399
worldly things

8281.599 --> 8286.719000000001
maintenance things everything

8284.399 --> 8290.599
so it already is effectively a journal

8286.719 --> 8290.598999999998
really what i'm doing here

8302.319 --> 8305.84
catch a stretch what

8311.519 --> 8315.76
with a journal you can read and reflect

8313.439 --> 8317.359
on previous thoughts yeah but with the

8315.76 --> 8320.0
video is harder what do you mean you

8317.359 --> 8321.92
just watch it back

8320.0 --> 8323.84
and then you can think of like oh yeah i

8321.92 --> 8327.04
was like this right because when you

8323.84 --> 8328.960000000001
write something down yeah you can still

8327.04 --> 8330.880000000001
grab into that a bit

8328.96 --> 8333.518999999998
what it was like

8330.88 --> 8336.0
but when you actually are on camera with

8333.519 --> 8338.0
voice actually doing it

8336.0 --> 8339.76
there's a lot more detail that's

8338.0 --> 8341.28
actually stored up with that than when

8339.76 --> 8343.2
you write it down

8341.28 --> 8344.479000000001
unless you become really good at

8343.2 --> 8347.12
descriptive

8344.479 --> 8350.0
writing expressive writing

8347.12 --> 8352.0
and then yeah

8350.0 --> 8354.24
but i've never been like a champion at

8352.0 --> 8354.24
that

8357.84 --> 8362.639000000001
my channel is a journal on steroids

8360.319 --> 8366.399
that's hilarious steamy traveler

8362.639 --> 8366.399
but yeah maybe it is a bit

8370.399 --> 8375.119999999999
totally different purpose okay try it it

8372.399 --> 8376.16
was fine rob a day that's all fine

8375.12 --> 8378.719000000001
it's just

8376.16 --> 8381.92
right anyway thanks everyone for coming

because that does happen sometimes in

8470.88 --> 8475.839999999998
the evening

8472.64 --> 8479.199999999999

8475.84 --> 8481.28
some point and yeah

8479.2 --> 8484.399000000001
it should

8481.28 --> 8486.319000000001
at least it's not growing worse guys so

8484.399 --> 8488.24
i technically as long as it's not

8486.319 --> 8491.6
constantly growing worse i shouldn't

8488.24 --> 8491.6
have to worry too much

8491.92 --> 8496.319
even though it's very aggravating at

8493.92 --> 8496.319
times

8496.56 --> 8500.64
right

8497.6 --> 8502.319
anyway i hope to see you there in chat

8500.64 --> 8506.72
and

8502.319 --> 8508.88
until the next video keep it flat

8506.72 --> 8510.319
and just take it easy and

8508.88 --> 8512.399
try to enjoy

8510.319 --> 8515.92
nice weather and all that while it's

8512.399 --> 8518.399
still there don't get too distracted by

8515.92 --> 8520.399
the weapons of mass distraction

8518.399 --> 8522.64
which are pretty much

8520.399 --> 8522.64
yeah

8524.88 --> 8530.8
carpet bombing the world right now with

8528.479 --> 8531.92
propaganda yeah weapons of mass

8530.8 --> 8535.599999999999
destruction

8531.92 --> 8537.359
mass distraction sorry

8535.6 --> 8539.12
was bound to happen at some point it's

8537.359 --> 8542.319
happening right now and just don't get

8539.12 --> 8545.2
too distracted and try to enjoy the good

8542.319 --> 8548.479
things that are still out there

8545.2 --> 8550.720000000001
don't let the nightmares basically take

8548.479 --> 8553.438999999998
that away from you

8550.72 --> 8555.56
right so until the next video keep it
