it's good

129.44 --> 143.84
uh i did forget to make some notes but

131.92 --> 143.83999999999997
i'll just do it right now

149.76 --> 155.519
yeah after the after my special

153.44 --> 157.44
i hang around hung around at martin

155.519 --> 159.92000000000002
litkes who also did the stream during

157.44 --> 163.35999999999999
that time

159.92 --> 166.23899999999998
and he nathan oakley

163.36 --> 166.239
thanks for sharing

166.56 --> 170.239
far works outside my place were insane

169.28 --> 174.64000000000001
really

170.239 --> 178.64000000000001
well compared to a couple of years ago

174.64 --> 182.319
it was still modest like last year

178.64 --> 182.319
it was much more heavy but

182.64 --> 186.64
there was so much smoke that you just

184.8 --> 189.12
couldn't see as much of it

186.64 --> 190.879
and this year there was a lot less smoke

189.12 --> 193.12
because there was on average just less

190.879 --> 197.2
firework especially building up

193.12 --> 201.20000000000002
to 12 o'clock there was just a lot less

197.2 --> 204.48
and it's still funny because technically

201.2 --> 207.83999999999997
fireworks was made illegal

204.48 --> 210.64
and it's just like stupid government

207.84 --> 210.959
thing so you couldn't buy it anywhere

210.64 --> 212.95899999999997
but

210.959 --> 216.64000000000001
yeah it seems like people don't really

212.959 --> 218.4
care or they just had a lot of storage

216.64 --> 220.319
because it kept on going pretty much

218.4 --> 222.48000000000002
until one o'clock

220.319 --> 224.159
and then it just started to die down

222.48 --> 227.28
slowly but it

224.159 --> 230.07999999999998
still kept on going for a very long time

227.28 --> 230.48
like even after i rounded out got on the

230.08 --> 234.08
roof

230.48 --> 237.04
over there let's show

234.08 --> 241.519
the weather by the way look it's even

237.04 --> 244.0
nice and blue

241.519 --> 244.0
look at that

246.959 --> 250.879
it's pretty nice it's still kind of cold

249.12 --> 254.87900000000002
though

250.879 --> 258.0
but yeah i had a good view

254.879 --> 261.359
from up on the roof there could also

258.0 --> 264.72
watch like behind the building that way

261.359 --> 266.88
and yeah there were certain places where

264.72 --> 269.12
there's just yeah there was a very

266.88 --> 272.88
specific locations like three

269.12 --> 274.96
spots basically where the fireworks just

272.88 --> 276.0
kept on going they had very big mortar

274.96 --> 278.32
like

276.0 --> 281.04
fireworks and every now and then they

278.32 --> 283.36
just kept on going

281.04 --> 284.24
it was pretty cool to watch but yeah the

283.36 --> 287.759
the webcam

284.24 --> 290.24
wouldn't pick that up as well

287.759 --> 291.28000000000003
i just looked at it oh yeah and it was

290.24 --> 293.12
freezing by the way

291.28 --> 294.55999999999995
notice that because when i was walking

293.12 --> 297.12
over the roof like

294.56 --> 297.919
the the rocks weren't loose it was kind

297.12 --> 299.919
of frozen

297.919 --> 302.08
and crispy sounding when i walked over

299.919 --> 305.19899999999996
it so

302.08 --> 308.479
it did get pretty cool

305.199 --> 312.88
right uh

308.479 --> 316.15999999999997
see yeah it was weird i had a an offline

312.88 --> 318.15999999999997
just unrecorded little hangout with

316.16 --> 320.40000000000003
some guys that i hadn't seen in a long

318.16 --> 320.40000000000003
time

320.88 --> 325.199
so through issa issa also did a bit of a

323.68 --> 327.919
music stream

325.199 --> 331.52000000000004
what time was that yeah that was before

327.919 --> 331.52
i didn't know a new year special

332.24 --> 336.96000000000004
yeah so i did forgot to make a note of

334.08 --> 336.96
it uh

337.039 --> 342.479
well through isa and all kinds of

340.08 --> 343.35999999999996
like the old an old guard and apparently

342.479 --> 345.59999999999997
they have been

343.36 --> 348.56
just keeping on doing what they've been

345.6 --> 348.56
doing for years

348.8 --> 354.16
and also following flat earth debate so

352.08 --> 357.68
i got a lot of hellos and

354.16 --> 359.12
hey i know you i even though i didn't

357.68 --> 362.479
know them

359.12 --> 364.319
but yeah it was to be expected and

362.479 --> 364.639
eventually did kind of drop out when i

364.319 --> 367.91900000000004
got

364.639 --> 369.6
into a bit of an ether wars situation

367.919 --> 371.28
with one of them

369.6 --> 373.44
started to claim that gravity is

371.28 --> 377.35999999999996
electrostatics and

373.44 --> 380.4
he did not like me going against that

377.36 --> 381.039
at all so i eventually just dropped but

380.4 --> 382.79999999999995
it was still

381.039 --> 384.4
interesting to hang around with that

382.8 --> 385.6
those guys and there was a baller in

384.4 --> 391.28
there too was very

385.6 --> 391.28000000000003
polite hadn't heard him before

392.4 --> 395.919
but yeah it was an interesting

393.759 --> 400.88
experience anyway look at that

395.919 --> 400.88
sun coming out nice

401.2 --> 404.69
[Music]

412.56 --> 415.199

418.8 --> 426.40000000000003

thanks for that i'm getting a lot of

433.84 --> 437.84
paypals that i don't mind

440.96 --> 444.96
really good start of the of nathan

443.44 --> 447.84
oakley

444.96 --> 447.84
you rascal

448.4 --> 465.84
you send me six euros and 66 cents

452.24 --> 465.84000000000003
thank you very much for that

469.759 --> 472.96000000000004
hey zach sterling

474.639 --> 478.56
oh uh the membership well membership on

477.599 --> 482.4
my channel is

478.56 --> 486.16
is kind of it's not really functional i

482.4 --> 486.15999999999997
had sort of a plan at the beginning

486.319 --> 492.319
with it to make like separate hangouts

488.96 --> 495.44
but that kind of

492.319 --> 497.12
like i can't it doesn't really work so

495.44 --> 498.8
that's why i'm not hyping on about the

497.12 --> 501.919
membership system too much but it

498.8 --> 503.919
it's just another way to support and hey

501.919 --> 505.75899999999996
i'm keeping the options open because at

503.919 --> 506.79999999999995
some point i might just do a members

505.759 --> 508.96000000000004
only

506.8 --> 510.96000000000004
special live stream or something i could

508.96 --> 512.88
have done that yesterday but

510.96 --> 515.36
i just wanted as many people in there as

512.88 --> 515.36
possible

515.599 --> 519.44
but at yeah at the current time i can't

518.64 --> 523.36
really promise

519.44 --> 525.519
anything special and besides

523.36 --> 527.12
like i originally had an idea like oh

525.519 --> 529.6
you can have the membership system and

527.12 --> 531.76
then upgrade and then i can

529.6 --> 533.519
get in yeah i will promise you special

531.76 --> 536.959
advice or something but

533.519 --> 540.64
technically at this point i already just

536.959 --> 543.4399999999999
do that if somebody gets

540.64 --> 544.959
close and it's working out the energies

543.44 --> 549.7600000000001
are working out between us

544.959 --> 554.56
and i kind of already do that anyway

549.76 --> 556.72
do i get your information what

554.56 --> 556.7199999999999
no

559.04 --> 563.279
doesn't provide me with any specific

561.04 --> 566.64
information

563.279 --> 566.64
if you become member

571.36 --> 580.48
yes i know nathan thank you for that i

575.279 --> 584.32
i checked it out if i join

580.48 --> 586.48
no i you don't get my information

584.32 --> 587.6
at least i don't think so i might be

586.48 --> 591.839
able to

587.6 --> 591.839
yes nathan i notice it's very cute

597.6 --> 605.839
i don't know why i have to joke around

599.279 --> 605.8389999999999
with that but oh well

608.0 --> 612.72
mine what

617.44 --> 621.36
i i was gonna say i might just be able

619.44 --> 624.0
to click

621.36 --> 625.6
like your channel or something if you

624.0 --> 627.2
become a member and that way

625.6 --> 633.839
find your channel that that is pretty

627.2 --> 633.839
much it

638.16 --> 641.68
i don't get your information

642.32 --> 646.6400000000001
at least not if there isn't any

644.88 --> 649.4399999999999
available for viewers

646.64 --> 649.4399999999999
on your channel

650.88 --> 654.0
i don't know why you would think that

652.64 --> 657.36
somebody would get

654.0 --> 658.16
your special information just by joining

657.36 --> 661.839
as a member

658.16 --> 661.8389999999999

748.88 --> 752.399
ah cool so there is going to be a

751.2 --> 758.48
january 1st

752.399 --> 763.44
flatter debates that's nice

758.48 --> 763.44
cool so that's in 42 minutes

763.92 --> 773.8389999999999
looking forward to it

775.2 --> 782.0790000000001
ah yeah and by the way ball busters

777.839 --> 782.0790000000001
tomorrow is also going to be live

782.639 --> 787.839
so that'll be cool in one hour

788.24 --> 792.32
oh right yeah you're right yeah one hour

791.2 --> 795.2
just

792.32 --> 795.7600000000001
never mind me yeah you're right it's not

795.2 --> 798.0790000000001
in

795.76 --> 799.68
42 minutes it's an hour and 42 minutes

798.079 --> 814.56
that's correct

799.68 --> 816.88
my bad

814.56 --> 816.88
ah

819.68 --> 824.0
so this year what's gonna happen what's

821.839 --> 826.24
gonna be this year

824.0 --> 827.04
i think this is like adam predicted like

826.24 --> 830.9590000000001
gonna be the

827.04 --> 834.959
the year yeah tear it

830.959 --> 843.8389999999999
it's it's gonna be the year where

834.959 --> 843.8389999999999
hold on

844.16 --> 850.959
the year of the ether wars

847.44 --> 850.9590000000001
or rather where

851.04 --> 855.279
in the yeah the flat earthers are going

852.88 --> 857.92
to go more inward and

855.279 --> 861.68
deal with other assumptions that have

857.92 --> 861.68
been made and popularized

865.44 --> 868.639
so i think that's going to happen when

868.0 --> 871.44
it comes to

868.639 --> 871.6800000000001
flat earth related things and it's going

871.44 --> 873.6
to

871.68 --> 875.12
ruffle a lot of feathers because there's

873.6 --> 877.44
a whole lot of people now that have

875.12 --> 879.12
taken on this new position

877.44 --> 880.72
that they don't really want to let go

879.12 --> 884.8
kind of like the ball but

880.72 --> 887.36
on another level uh

884.8 --> 890.3199999999999
you're gonna join christianity and read

887.36 --> 890.32
the bible okay

892.32 --> 900.24
good for you zack sterling

898.0 --> 903.04
just take into account it that's really

900.24 --> 903.04
just the beginning

906.079 --> 912.2399999999999
and in the beginning everything does

909.36 --> 914.399
see it does seem kind of simple and hey

912.24 --> 916.32
in certain elements it is but it is only

914.399 --> 917.6
the beginning because when some things

916.32 --> 919.519
get simple

917.6 --> 921.22
other things get more into focus and

919.519 --> 923.199
then you find

921.22 --> 925.6
[Music]

923.199 --> 926.639
sort of the same thing over and over

925.6 --> 929.839
again that's

926.639 --> 931.6800000000001
that's life so

929.839 --> 933.9200000000001
it's figuring out how you're going to do

931.68 --> 935.8389999999999
it what does it really mean what are the

933.92 --> 938.7199999999999
pitfalls

935.839 --> 940.1600000000001
the path is going to get more narrow if

938.72 --> 943.279
you're very serious about

940.16 --> 943.279
being a christian so

943.519 --> 950.72
but i'll be here and you've got some new

946.88 --> 954.88
sources to look into and learn from so

950.72 --> 956.9590000000001
yeah you got a good start at least

954.88 --> 959.04
you should see journey to a garther

956.959 --> 961.7589999999999
movie i see it might have seen that

959.04 --> 964.0
derek i mean it's been some time ago

961.759 --> 964.0
though

964.48 --> 969.839
could you join is that all right

974.8 --> 978.24
what's up kartha isn't that

979.6 --> 986.12
isn't that like a

982.959 --> 988.3199999999999
the inner like an inner realm

986.12 --> 990.32
sub-terrestrial realm isn't it according

988.32 --> 992.0790000000001
to the cosmogeny that if you go north

990.32 --> 994.839
that you go inside the earth

992.079 --> 997.8389999999999
which spawned kind of the hollow earth

994.839 --> 997.839
idea

1000.88 --> 1004.32
if i remember correctly

1005.6 --> 1011.839
hate what was all

1012.8 --> 1025.839
animation what oh it's fiction

1026.4 --> 1030.3190000000002
something but is it is it like a

1031.6 --> 1038.079
like a fantasy movie animated movie or

1035.679 --> 1040.48
is it more like a documentary style

1038.079 --> 1041.36
what is what is it i don't remember the

1040.48 --> 1044.559
content i just

1041.36 --> 1048.9589999999998
know that the name agartha

1044.559 --> 1048.959
reminds me of of that direction

1049.039 --> 1053.84
of the hollow earth

1066.16 --> 1070.24
all right something like that i guess

1074.4 --> 1078.48
is it somewhere on youtube if so you can

1076.72 --> 1081.84
just put the link in the chat

1078.48 --> 1081.84
you got a wrench

1106.84 --> 1109.84
right

1112.64 --> 1116.5590000000002
i don't think i've seen that movie

1119.039 --> 1123.039
if that is the basically the setup and

1121.28 --> 1137.84
i'm pretty sure i haven't seen it i've

1123.039 --> 1137.84
just heard of it

1142.72 --> 1150.32
that's a very good move zach sterling

1147.52 --> 1151.2
for me the key to doing it was to just

1150.32 --> 1154.32
understand

1151.2 --> 1154.32
why they're doing it

1159.36 --> 1162.6399999999999
that because when you get into their

1161.919 --> 1165.76
skin

1162.64 --> 1166.7990000000002
from a spiritual standpoint then it

1165.76 --> 1170.24
takes away the

1166.799 --> 1172.799
the personal element like taking it

1170.24 --> 1172.799
personal

1172.96 --> 1176.32
and then it's much easier to forgive to

1176.0 --> 1179.679
just

1176.32 --> 1183.4399999999998
endure and move on and you can

1179.679 --> 1186.96
try to figure things out retroactively

1183.44 --> 1186.96
that way anyway

1189.6 --> 1196.7199999999998
ah right there at 306 thank you

1194.0 --> 1196.72
check that out

1199.2 --> 1203.3600000000001
anime it's an anime movie oh

1204.84 --> 1207.84
whoa

1213.44 --> 1218.0
what the oh great it's always nice when

1216.88 --> 1221.8400000000001
you mute something

1218.0 --> 1221.84
and then it isn't muted after all

1223.52 --> 1228.32
but that looks pretty wow that's really

1225.28 --> 1228.32
high quality too

1231.679 --> 1236.64
okay a big movie almost two hours i will

1234.96 --> 1241.2
definitely check that out

1236.64 --> 1241.2
at some point thank you for that

1241.919 --> 1249.8400000000001
have i forgiven good servant well

1250.96 --> 1258.72
what does that mean steamy traveler

1254.4 --> 1261.52
it that's a complicated like should i

1258.72 --> 1263.52
i forgive myself for having misjudged

1261.52 --> 1265.76
him

1263.52 --> 1268.08
even though it is very embarrassing

1265.76 --> 1268.08
still

1269.76 --> 1273.039
i forgive myself for

1273.44 --> 1276.96
magically thinking that there was more

1275.679 --> 1280.96
in him even though

1276.96 --> 1284.159
the signs were already showing

1280.96 --> 1287.679
that it that he couldn't handle it but

1284.159 --> 1291.44
i went the route of trying it out

1287.679 --> 1294.799
testing him by sharing very heavy stuff

1291.44 --> 1297.8400000000001
from inside my own struggles

1294.799 --> 1298.96
with it like it is just sharing it is a

1297.84 --> 1300.9599999999998
test

1298.96 --> 1302.32
and i think that other people who have

1300.96 --> 1305.44
felt a lot of it

1302.32 --> 1308.6
they know this because it's intuitive

1305.44 --> 1311.919
it's just sharing very heavy deep

1308.6 --> 1314.32
contemplations is like a test

1311.919 --> 1315.8400000000001
it's like i share the same frequency of

1314.32 --> 1319.84
thinking and that's like

1315.84 --> 1322.72
pretty heavy stuff and yeah you can just

1319.84 --> 1324.9599999999998
misinterpret it or get up obsessed with

1322.72 --> 1328.24
certain elements because it's too much

1324.96 --> 1329.8400000000001
and that is the test that is just it's

1328.24 --> 1331.44
natural it's not even a planned thing

1329.84 --> 1333.28
it's just the natural working of that

1331.44 --> 1336.159
it's just like

1333.28 --> 1337.28
testing how much they can handle by

1336.159 --> 1340.5590000000002
sharing the weight

1337.28 --> 1342.8799999999999
not giving it to them but just sharing

1340.559 --> 1345.84
it with them

1342.88 --> 1346.48
knowing what it is and what it does

1345.84 --> 1350.1589999999999
because

1346.48 --> 1353.039
yeah and he just

1350.159 --> 1353.0390000000002
he couldn't handle it

1353.52 --> 1357.2
and that's not his fault or well it is

1356.24 --> 1360.48
his fault

1357.2 --> 1364.24
it's hard to tell but it's my

1360.48 --> 1365.919
mistake for base yeah well

1364.24 --> 1367.6
it's even mistake because there was a

1365.919 --> 1369.76
purpose to it but

1367.6 --> 1369.76
i

1371.039 --> 1374.24
i made a mistake that i basically was

1373.6 --> 1378.6399999999999
very

1374.24 --> 1381.919
forward that my frontline

1378.64 --> 1383.6000000000001
fears and hopes and delusions in a way

1381.919 --> 1386.0800000000002
that i was trying to figure out that i

1383.6 --> 1388.3999999999999
would share that so far with somebody

1386.08 --> 1390.8799999999999
and so it was a test for me as well as

1388.4 --> 1390.88
for him

1391.4 --> 1396.3200000000002
[Music]

1392.88 --> 1396.88
and it was like almost unnecessarily

1396.32 --> 1400.96
risky

1396.88 --> 1400.96
in retrospect doing that

1401.2 --> 1404.559
but at the same time it like it yeah

1403.52 --> 1406.48
it's it's now

1404.559 --> 1407.76
all everything is different i got sick

1406.48 --> 1410.88
after or i got

1407.76 --> 1415.2
sick at some point remember and then

1410.88 --> 1418.96
switched around so i can't even properly

1415.2 --> 1420.72
explain or feel back like why i felt the

1418.96 --> 1426.08
necessity to do that i guess i

1420.72 --> 1426.08
i felt i was trying to find others

1427.679 --> 1432.0800000000002
like pull people up maybe i was too

1430.159 --> 1434.4
eager with it

1432.08 --> 1435.9189999999999
and it's weird also because good servant

1434.4 --> 1438.799
was suffering under that

1435.919 --> 1440.3200000000002
as well so maybe i kind of took that

1438.799 --> 1442.799
over from him

1440.32 --> 1446.3999999999999
he was just so desperate to get people

1442.799 --> 1448.32
to get over their delusions

1446.4 --> 1450.3200000000002
because he was constantly fixated on

1448.32 --> 1453.36
that very polarized in his

1450.32 --> 1456.0
way of looking he wasn't

1453.36 --> 1458.799
doing that on purpose he just kept

1456.0 --> 1462.24
getting stuck in that

1458.799 --> 1465.52
so i don't know should i forgive him

1462.24 --> 1468.48
he hasn't technically done anything that

1465.52 --> 1472.96
is just way out of control

1468.48 --> 1477.679
that's like really shameful it's just

1472.96 --> 1481.1200000000001
kind of roll into a bad place

1477.679 --> 1483.279
among yeah annoying people

1481.12 --> 1485.039
that that where there's very little

1483.279 --> 1488.32
productivity to be gained

1485.039 --> 1489.84
from what i can see and that's just

1488.32 --> 1491.52
his personal mistake that's not a

1489.84 --> 1493.4399999999998
mistake towards me it's just a

1491.52 --> 1495.36
disappointment that's it so

1493.44 --> 1497.8400000000001
i hope that answers that question see me

1495.36 --> 1501.12
traveler

1497.84 --> 1504.3999999999999
hello exponential monk

1501.12 --> 1515.84
i look like a klingon today really

1504.4 --> 1515.8400000000001
how so this is what

1526.84 --> 1529.84
uh

1531.36 --> 1536.3999999999999
right anyway any other questions i like

1540.84 --> 1544.24
that all the birds out there are really

1543.6 --> 1547.6
relieved

1544.24 --> 1549.679
that yeah all that noise and explosions

1547.6 --> 1556.3999999999999
everywhere is kind of over

1549.679 --> 1558.159
like very relieved

1556.4 --> 1560.24
like they were complaining throughout

1558.159 --> 1562.7990000000002
the night

1560.24 --> 1564.559
like birds were just complaining like ah

1562.799 --> 1568.24
can't get in a second's rest because

1564.559 --> 1568.24
it's constant that noise everywhere

1568.84 --> 1571.84
this

1582.84 --> 1586.6399999999999
okay

1584.4 --> 1586.64
so

1587.76 --> 1590.96
anybody still out there

1591.6 --> 1596.84
i thought i was in the middle of a

1592.799 --> 1599.84
conversation and now it's five minutes

1596.84 --> 1599.84
later

1604.0 --> 1613.84
hello here we go again

1614.68 --> 1617.8590000000002
[Music]

1628.96 --> 1633.919
right anyway what i think is going to

1630.88 --> 1636.5590000000002
happen is that instead of

1633.919 --> 1639.2
the old ballers coming up with new

1636.559 --> 1642.0
machinations and new tricks

1639.2 --> 1645.52
stepping forward i think that's going to

1642.0 --> 1645.52
take a background seed a little

1646.559 --> 1652.84
it already has and it's going to be more

1649.679 --> 1654.24
ether wars related [ __ ] so ether

1652.84 --> 1656.9599999999998
reification

1654.24 --> 1658.559
and gravity reification probably through

1656.96 --> 1661.76
electrostatics

1658.559 --> 1663.52
it's look i've been there

1661.76 --> 1668.32
i've literally been there done that

1663.52 --> 1670.76
defended that and then figured out wait

1668.32 --> 1672.72
it doesn't actually work with the

1670.76 --> 1673.679
electrostatics by the way i've been

1672.72 --> 1677.08
saying that

1673.679 --> 1680.3990000000001
way before already because it's like

1677.08 --> 1682.799
electrostatics is measurable

1680.399 --> 1684.799
palpable you can very manipulate it you

1682.799 --> 1687.84
can cause it

1684.799 --> 1690.559
and it has a specific reach like

1687.84 --> 1691.52
the way it works it has an origin point

1690.559 --> 1693.2
and then a reach

1691.52 --> 1695.36
and it decreases in strength over

1693.2 --> 1696.3990000000001
distance so how can that equate to a

1695.36 --> 1699.039
universal

1696.399 --> 1701.12
field that is undetectable that you

1699.039 --> 1703.279
can't very manipulate you can only add

1701.12 --> 1705.6789999999999
to it

1703.279 --> 1707.2
how can electrostatics work over

1705.679 --> 1710.0
incredible distances

1707.2 --> 1710.48
that is the big question oh it can't

1710.0 --> 1712.559
well

1710.48 --> 1716.48
there you go and that was my argument

1712.559 --> 1716.48
like even four or five years ago

1720.08 --> 1723.52
and i think that's why they put the

1721.6 --> 1725.84
incoherent before it

1723.52 --> 1727.76
in front of the name or something or

1725.84 --> 1728.32
they call it something else but it's it

1727.76 --> 1732.32
can't be

1728.32 --> 1735.2
it can't really be electrical like that

1732.32 --> 1737.36
because of the the universal properties

1735.2 --> 1738.3990000000001
of electricity within the physical realm

1737.36 --> 1740.799
it's palpable

1738.399 --> 1743.1999999999998
it's measurable and it decreases power

1740.799 --> 1746.399
over distance and so it cannot be

1743.2 --> 1752.799
that it cannot be the cause

1746.399 --> 1754.8799999999999
for the relative density alignment

1752.799 --> 1758.8799999999999
yeah there is electricity definitely but

1754.88 --> 1758.88
it's not the cause of relative density

1759.44 --> 1767.8400000000001
of the alignment of the directions

1768.0 --> 1771.039
it's just a concept it's an idea that

1770.08 --> 1774.799
people really

1771.039 --> 1777.12
want it because it fills in things

1774.799 --> 1781.36
because they still feel

1777.12 --> 1784.7199999999998
very restless

1781.36 --> 1787.039
to realize that they don't know

1784.72 --> 1788.08
and that they don't have a clue where to

1787.039 --> 1790.799
start

1788.08 --> 1791.4399999999998
so they just make up an idea and then

1790.799 --> 1794.08
reify

1791.44 --> 1795.76
it and then take it as if that is the

1794.08 --> 1798.799
the answer

1795.76 --> 1799.919
it's a bad habit it well or it closes

1798.799 --> 1802.24
off that entire

1799.919 --> 1804.48
field of study it closes off the

1802.24 --> 1806.3990000000001
opportunities the micro opportunities

1804.48 --> 1808.08
where you just catch a new idea you

1806.399 --> 1810.08
catch a new view to things that's why

1808.08 --> 1813.279
i've been keeping

1810.08 --> 1814.399
that away as much as possible i am the

1813.279 --> 1817.44
living proof

1814.399 --> 1819.1999999999998
of what i just said because once you

1817.44 --> 1821.679
figure out wait this is really not

1819.2 --> 1826.559
possible and i don't know

1821.679 --> 1830.159
then you do get ideas other ideas

1826.559 --> 1833.279
you leave it alone and it makes room

1830.159 --> 1835.44
for other things because it can be

1833.279 --> 1836.159
ignored it's not there for you to

1835.44 --> 1838.159
discover

1836.159 --> 1839.919
in your mind because people that believe

1838.159 --> 1842.0800000000002
in that sort of thing they think it's

1839.919 --> 1843.3600000000001
out there waiting to be discovered

1842.08 --> 1847.12
somehow

1843.36 --> 1849.52
but when you approach with your spirit

1847.12 --> 1850.8799999999999
things like that that's that's what

1849.52 --> 1852.48
aberrations do that's

1850.88 --> 1854.159
specifically that's like the ghost

1852.48 --> 1857.279
that's like oh it must be there

1854.159 --> 1859.679
i'm gonna find it but you never will

1857.279 --> 1860.32
but because you've been trying to find

1859.679 --> 1863.2
it

1860.32 --> 1865.84
it distracts you from what is actually

1863.2 --> 1865.8400000000001
there

1871.44 --> 1874.64
yeah that's gravity and aberration and

1873.919 --> 1879.8400000000001
so is the

1874.64 --> 1879.8400000000001
light-based ether

1881.76 --> 1888.24
because if you just go

1884.799 --> 1891.6
with information wise but by a void

1888.24 --> 1893.519
a stillness and a void ignoring the

1891.6 --> 1897.76
suggestions and only accept what is

1893.519 --> 1900.32
absolutely palpably provably there

1897.76 --> 1902.559
then there's all this room but you don't

1900.32 --> 1904.8799999999999
have to be afraid of it

1902.559 --> 1906.559
you see because everything is still what

1904.88 --> 1909.279
it is everything is still going whether

1906.559 --> 1911.36
you think about it or not

1909.279 --> 1913.36
there that is an important realization

1911.36 --> 1915.519
that was a big important realization to

1913.36 --> 1920.9599999999998
me it's okay not to know

1915.519 --> 1922.559
you don't have to be afraid

1920.96 --> 1924.0
and then when you're not afraid then

1922.559 --> 1927.12
it's like things

1924.0 --> 1927.12
spring forth

1927.2 --> 1934.799
from it it's like a void and just

1930.399 --> 1939.12
new insights pop out of it

1934.799 --> 1939.12
start very small it's yeah

1944.88 --> 1952.96
like chasing a ghost in information

1948.08 --> 1952.96
land is a very bad habit

1953.2 --> 1959.76
it decreases the natural spring

1956.24 --> 1963.039
from which ideas come

1959.76 --> 1963.6
because it really wrote you makes you

1963.039 --> 1969.2
want to

1963.6 --> 1969.1999999999998
find that thing it's an aberration

1974.88 --> 1979.279
what our monolith oh god that thing i

1977.6 --> 1991.84
don't know

1979.279 --> 1991.84
some media thing

1993.9 --> 1997.039
[Music]

2004.48 --> 2008.72
any plans for changes or updates to my

2006.96 --> 2012.32
channel

2008.72 --> 2016.96
well i had been thinking of

2012.32 --> 2020.08
basically revamping it somehow but

2016.96 --> 2022.88
no there's no direct ideas

2020.08 --> 2022.8799999999999
of changing

2023.519 --> 2026.88
although i have been pondering on how

2025.84 --> 2029.4399999999998
can i prevent

2026.88 --> 2030.3200000000002
more silent moments because i yeah i've

2029.44 --> 2032.48
already

2030.32 --> 2034.799
figured out okay it's just going to be

2032.48 --> 2034.799
this

2035.36 --> 2039.6789999999999
what i've been doing just doing the show

2037.84 --> 2041.519
nothing special

2039.679 --> 2043.8400000000001
bring up subject that i normally talk

2041.519 --> 2045.039
about and then yeah basically accept the

2043.84 --> 2047.039
void and hope

2045.039 --> 2048.96
that somebody asks a good question or

2047.039 --> 2050.8
i'm thinking of something

2048.96 --> 2054.159
and then it rolls out then i put down

2050.8 --> 2057.119
something that is interesting

2054.159 --> 2057.52
and since that model is the model that

2057.119 --> 2061.679
i'm

2057.52 --> 2063.839
using for how to do things on my show

2061.679 --> 2066.32
i'm just going to try to see if i can

2063.839 --> 2069.2
improve it further based on that

2066.32 --> 2075.2000000000003
already functioning system see if i can

2069.2 --> 2077.359
fill in the blanks better

2075.2 --> 2078.7999999999997
absolutely this is the has been the year

2077.359 --> 2080.3199999999997
of making notes

2078.8 --> 2082.5600000000004
and that that's been kind of an

2080.32 --> 2084.8790000000004
important change for me

2082.56 --> 2086.32
might seem very trivial to people that

2084.879 --> 2088.639
are used to that but for me

2086.32 --> 2091.679
it's something that i i don't really

2088.639 --> 2095.599
have a natural habit doing

2091.679 --> 2098.56
but it has been very functional and

2095.599 --> 2100.4
yeah i'm running out of note block so i

2098.56 --> 2101.68
might at some point get an agenda and

2100.4 --> 2104.4
then continue it

2101.68 --> 2105.2799999999997
or get a bit bigger note block and make

2104.4 --> 2108.64
more notes

2105.28 --> 2112.6400000000003
even though it seems like annoying to me

2108.64 --> 2117.68
expanding on notes it may turn out to be

2112.64 --> 2120.0789999999997
quite functional at some point

2117.68 --> 2121.04
that out because then that way i can

2120.079 --> 2124.96
have sort of a

2121.04 --> 2127.2799999999997
natural speaking point

2124.96 --> 2128.32
reference and this is a lot of people in

2127.28 --> 2130.1600000000003
media do that

2128.32 --> 2132.2400000000002
and then eventually they start out with

2130.16 --> 2135.68
notes doing that speaking points

2132.24 --> 2136.4799999999996
words keywords on a yeah on a piece of

2135.68 --> 2138.96
paper

2136.48 --> 2141.44
and eventually they just do that all in

2138.96 --> 2141.44
their hand

2142.0 --> 2145.599
i'm basically already doing that i just

2144.4 --> 2148.88
don't have a

2145.599 --> 2150.96
prefab agenda don't have a lot of

2148.88 --> 2151.839
specific things it's just what comes

2150.96 --> 2153.599
around

2151.839 --> 2154.88
i take it i deal with it i make a

2153.599 --> 2157.119
prediction i

2154.88 --> 2158.56
say forecast where i think it's going

2157.119 --> 2160.56
where it should be going what

2158.56 --> 2162.24
people should be doing and that's it i

2160.56 --> 2165.92
just leave it to that

2162.24 --> 2168.16
if i'm addressed about it another time

2165.92 --> 2169.599
it's very logical that i'll respond

2168.16 --> 2172.16
pretty much the same way

2169.599 --> 2174.2400000000002
with the same plan and i wouldn't

2172.16 --> 2176.64
necessarily even have to remember that i

2174.24 --> 2179.2799999999997
already addressed it

2176.64 --> 2180.48
i hope people have taken notice of that

2179.28 --> 2182.88
i hope

2180.48 --> 2183.68
because i don't keep careful track of it

2182.88 --> 2186.0
that i am

2183.68 --> 2188.24
very consistent in a natural fashion

2186.0 --> 2188.24
that

2188.48 --> 2191.52
from an unknowing standpoint i answered

2190.88 --> 2194.1600000000003
the

2191.52 --> 2195.7599999999998
same things same questions in the

2194.16 --> 2199.04
similar way

2195.76 --> 2202.4
or identical can anybody

2199.04 --> 2205.52
confirm that is that the case or is

2202.4 --> 2208.0
there always slight variance going on

2205.52 --> 2208.88
i'm not 100 sure i hope i'm very

2208.0 --> 2215.21
consistent

2208.88 --> 2218.26
i try to be it's very important to me

2215.21 --> 2218.26
[Music]

2219.599 --> 2223.92
ah right yeah well tara 306 look if

2222.4 --> 2224.7200000000003
you're gonna upload your consciousness

2223.92 --> 2228.4
somewhere yeah

2224.72 --> 2231.839
anything is possible because then

2228.4 --> 2235.04
you can enter a virtual realm where

2231.839 --> 2237.7599999999998
yeah heliocentrism is a reality

2235.04 --> 2238.4
you can go into science fiction space

2237.76 --> 2243.8390000000004
and just

2238.4 --> 2243.839
go whatever do all of that

2249.359 --> 2253.68
like let's just say for a moment because

2252.24 --> 2254.3999999999996
i don't think like uploading your

2253.68 --> 2258.0
consciousness

2254.4 --> 2260.8
is anything other than just eugenics

2258.0 --> 2260.8
getting rid of you

2261.04 --> 2266.16
if there were a jacking in situation

2264.079 --> 2268.42
like in the matrix

2266.16 --> 2269.68
the matrix like that thing

2268.42 --> 2272.88
[Music]

2269.68 --> 2274.24
yeah heliocentrism could just be made

2272.88 --> 2277.6800000000003
real in there

2274.24 --> 2281.2799999999997
could be the virtual world that is

2277.68 --> 2284.24
science fiction like it could be done

2281.28 --> 2286.88
if there is such a high level type of

2284.24 --> 2289.9199999999996
interfacing with computers even possible

2286.88 --> 2289.92
not sure about that

2292.079 --> 2295.28
so for baller zealots eventually they'll

2294.64 --> 2298.3199999999997
be very

2295.28 --> 2300.8
likely to become completely

2298.32 --> 2300.8
bound

2301.359 --> 2304.56
to such a virtual emulation because in

2303.839 --> 2306.7999999999997
that world

2304.56 --> 2308.16
it's just real it's how it's supposed to

2306.8 --> 2311.44
be you see

2308.16 --> 2312.56
that's the weird thing is i've even

2311.44 --> 2314.48
predicted that

2312.56 --> 2315.68
when i still believed in the ball in a

2314.48 --> 2320.64
very weird

2315.68 --> 2320.64
cognitive dissonance way 20 years ago

2321.599 --> 2327.839
or a little more 25 years ago something

2325.52 --> 2327.839
like that

2331.65 --> 2334.78
[Music]

2338.839 --> 2342.48
what

2340.0 --> 2344.24
think nah it's just talk it's just

2342.48 --> 2348.2400000000002
planting the ideas

2344.24 --> 2350.7999999999997
real eroding you there at 306.

2348.24 --> 2352.56
it's just placing the ideas it's

2350.8 --> 2354.88
information placement

2352.56 --> 2356.0
of like look this is the side this is

2354.88 --> 2357.92
the way things

2356.0 --> 2360.32
are going this is the science fiction

2357.92 --> 2363.599
thing that is going to happen

2360.32 --> 2366.2400000000002
that's what that is every time

2363.599 --> 2366.6400000000003
somebody does that they're building

2366.24 --> 2372.3199999999997
their

2366.64 --> 2372.3199999999997
their railroad for the train to come

2372.56 --> 2374.7999999999997
see

2378.0 --> 2381.76
but it's all virtual it's all in

2379.68 --> 2384.3999999999996
everybody's mind everybody's that that's

2381.76 --> 2384.4
watching that

2388.079 --> 2393.52
it will never actually happen well i

2391.52 --> 2394.8
i basically said that at some point

2393.52 --> 2398.8
maybe

2394.8 --> 2400.079
if a virtual interface a jacking in type

2398.8 --> 2402.32
of matrix system

2400.079 --> 2404.5600000000004
would become or is already possible and

2402.32 --> 2405.839
it's actually effective and not just oh

2404.56 --> 2410.319
it's good enough and

2405.839 --> 2411.86
completely broken in reality

2410.319 --> 2414.319
then maybe it will happen

2411.86 --> 2418.48
[Music]

2414.319 --> 2420.64
but only in the simulation

2418.48 --> 2422.079
as for every time they say upload your

2420.64 --> 2425.52
conscience that's just

2422.079 --> 2426.5600000000004
that's a eugenics trap it's like oh yeah

2425.52 --> 2429.7599999999998
you can become

2426.56 --> 2433.359
virtual well your body's gonna die

2429.76 --> 2436.4
so good luck with that whether it is

2433.359 --> 2438.0
real or not nobody will be able to

2436.4 --> 2440.0
really find out or maybe you

2438.0 --> 2441.28
will find out that it's just not true

2440.0 --> 2444.24
and it's just a cheap

2441.28 --> 2447.3590000000004
emulation has nothing to do with the

2444.24 --> 2447.359
person's consciousness

2448.319 --> 2455.599
you know because virtualizing

2452.48 --> 2459.04
like like

2455.599 --> 2460.48
is that even possible or is there like

2459.04 --> 2463.7599999999998
an infinite fractal

2460.48 --> 2466.4
thing to the spirit in a human being

2463.76 --> 2468.1600000000003
and what they do that just cannot be

2466.4 --> 2469.76
digitized

2468.16 --> 2471.839
i think that is the case i think there's

2469.76 --> 2473.3590000000004
an element to people that just cannot be

2471.839 --> 2476.7999999999997
digitized

2473.359 --> 2479.04
you can't emulate it fully you can only

2476.8 --> 2482.88
mimic it

2479.04 --> 2487.44
have i seen westworld yes i've seen that

2482.88 --> 2487.44
vanilla sky yeah i've also seen that

2490.0 --> 2495.839
it's a very interesting movie vanilla

2492.839 --> 2495.839
sky

2496.64 --> 2502.7999999999997
right yeah westworld is also based on

2500.079 --> 2507.52
the premise that

2502.8 --> 2510.0
artificial intelligence can be so fully

2507.52 --> 2510.56
emulating people just like for example

2510.0 --> 2515.599
data

2510.56 --> 2515.599
in star trek next generation that

2516.48 --> 2521.2
they could even be made to think they're

2518.8 --> 2521.2000000000003
human

2521.44 --> 2528.079
it just gets into yeah but it is

2524.8 --> 2530.0
that those people those robots there are

2528.079 --> 2532.1600000000003
not

2530.0 --> 2533.44
they're built they're built from scratch

2532.16 --> 2536.72
they're programmed they

2533.44 --> 2539.52
are not copied from an

2536.72 --> 2541.1189999999997
original person there who uploaded their

2539.52 --> 2543.44
that's not that series

2541.119 --> 2544.2400000000002
you see it's a whole different approach

2543.44 --> 2546.16
it's all about

2544.24 --> 2548.0789999999997
really design and consciousness and how

2546.16 --> 2550.16
does this work what

2548.079 --> 2552.5600000000004
what makes somebody human is it that

2550.16 --> 2555.04
they believe they're human

2552.56 --> 2556.0789999999997
is it certain actions what what about

2555.04 --> 2559.44
the

2556.079 --> 2560.0
actual humans and all their erratic

2559.44 --> 2562.839
nature

2560.0 --> 2564.0
and their their corruption it's just a

2562.839 --> 2568.24
very

2564.0 --> 2578.4
big philosophical soup

2568.24 --> 2581.04
philosophy soup that's westworld

2578.4 --> 2583.599
what dolores i don't know who you're

2581.04 --> 2583.599
talking about

2589.599 --> 2594.2400000000002
keep my intro yeah here we go i will

2592.72 --> 2596.64
keep the intro i'm very

2594.24 --> 2597.68
happy with the intro i'm very happy

2596.64 --> 2600.7999999999997
because it was my

2597.68 --> 2602.72
idea it was like a small piece of

2600.8 --> 2604.4
like i was very certain about what i

2602.72 --> 2607.839
wanted

2604.4 --> 2607.839
so i'm very happy with my intro

2608.64 --> 2612.56
and as long as the early bird show keeps

2610.72 --> 2615.2
going that intro will be

2612.56 --> 2615.2
its intro

2617.52 --> 2623.44
do i believe in jinns well that depends

2620.079 --> 2623.44
on what you think a gin is

2623.68 --> 2626.96
look in my dark world experiences i've

2626.56 --> 2629.839
met

2626.96 --> 2631.839
encountered all kinds of bizarre things

2629.839 --> 2634.0
and extra dimensional spirits even

2631.839 --> 2636.48
really dark ones i probably did meet

2634.0 --> 2636.48
jins

2637.92 --> 2642.16
it's all just really weird and i can't

2641.119 --> 2646.48
be certain whether

2642.16 --> 2646.48
it was a construct

2646.8 --> 2650.7200000000003
made to be seen like a jinn or that it

2649.2 --> 2656.0
was an actual

2650.72 --> 2656.0
entity spirit entity that i was facing

2656.8 --> 2660.0
in simulator reform i'm not too sure but

2659.2 --> 2662.48
i have

2660.0 --> 2664.8
met other entities that were quite

2662.48 --> 2667.28
unnerving to be in their presence

2664.8 --> 2668.2400000000002
and i wasn't really sure what they are

2667.28 --> 2670.8
like

2668.24 --> 2673.1189999999997
i was going in there basically from sort

2670.8 --> 2673.119
of an

2674.56 --> 2679.7599999999998
it's not eight but sort of an atheist

2677.92 --> 2682.2400000000002
perspective like i wasn't really too

2679.76 --> 2685.599
sure what was happening

2682.24 --> 2685.5989999999997
when a lot of these things happen

2688.56 --> 2692.64
so i might have

2693.119 --> 2696.2400000000002
but i've never been like oh can i have a

2695.119 --> 2698.7200000000003
wish or something

2696.24 --> 2699.52
no i was terrified of that it's like

2698.72 --> 2701.839
yeah if you

2699.52 --> 2705.119
entered if you connect to other

2701.839 --> 2708.4
dimensional entities they get a foothold

2705.119 --> 2712.0
in you potentially forever

2708.4 --> 2713.04
so as far as i know i've completely

2712.0 --> 2718.24
avoided that

2713.04 --> 2721.359
this is very terrifying

2718.24 --> 2722.8799999999997
because i don't know i knew that

2721.359 --> 2725.2
that is something that i did know i

2722.88 --> 2726.4
don't even know how i got to know that i

2725.2 --> 2730.0789999999997
just know that

2726.4 --> 2732.1600000000003
i know i knew already and maybe it's

2730.079 --> 2734.7200000000003
just intuitively maybe it's just

2732.16 --> 2737.1189999999997
my subconscious just starts to whisper

2734.72 --> 2738.7999999999997
even within your spirit like if you feel

2737.119 --> 2740.6400000000003
like reaching out

2738.8 --> 2743.599
then it's just whispering to you like if

2740.64 --> 2746.72
you do that this is going to happen

2743.599 --> 2749.76
it's yeah extra dimensional experience

2746.72 --> 2752.0789999999997
really weird

2749.76 --> 2753.6800000000003
especially if you literally don't know

2752.079 --> 2758.5600000000004
what it is

2753.68 --> 2758.56
and it just happens to you all of a

2758.839 --> 2762.24
sudden

2760.01 --> 2764.3190000000004
[Music]

2762.24 --> 2766.56
it's like oh waking up in the dream

2764.319 --> 2768.56
world where nobody even knows that it's

2766.56 --> 2769.359
actually happening and nobody gave you

2768.56 --> 2771.119
instructions

2769.359 --> 2772.56
except for things that you're not even

2771.119 --> 2774.96
sure what they are

2772.56 --> 2776.64
in the beginning as a little kid as a

2774.96 --> 2779.119
little kid you just take everything for

2776.64 --> 2779.1189999999997
granted

2779.68 --> 2783.52
basically you do listen more to the

2781.68 --> 2785.1189999999997
frequency so in a way it is a better way

2783.52 --> 2786.319
of going about but when you get older

2785.119 --> 2788.56
you get ideas you

2786.319 --> 2789.44
you start to do all these things in your

2788.56 --> 2791.52
mind and then

2789.44 --> 2794.2400000000002
everything starts to change also in the

2791.52 --> 2794.24
other dimension

2798.0 --> 2802.24
like and the darkness started creeping

2800.96 --> 2805.28
up from in there

2802.24 --> 2805.839
as it was from the outside in the real

2805.28 --> 2809.3590000000004
world

2805.839 --> 2812.319
being confronted with lies

2809.359 --> 2814.56
and dark organizations and people that

2812.319 --> 2817.599
would actually just

2814.56 --> 2819.52
double down on evil knowingly

2817.599 --> 2820.6400000000003
that was very shocking to me and that

2819.52 --> 2822.64
also changed

2820.64 --> 2825.04
yeah my spiritual experiences on the

2822.64 --> 2828.839
other side haunted me

2825.04 --> 2831.2
big time really like really paranoia

2828.839 --> 2834.319
level

2831.2 --> 2835.9199999999996
but i kept it out

2834.319 --> 2839.68
in the physical in the physical

2835.92 --> 2839.6800000000003
experience it's odd

2841.52 --> 2846.16
you could say i had nightmares and those

2843.52 --> 2848.16
nightmares basically were so vivid

2846.16 --> 2850.48
that it was like a virtual experience at

2848.16 --> 2850.48
times

2851.52 --> 2859.839
it's yeah

2854.559 --> 2859.8390000000004
anyway me and dreams

2894.079 --> 2901.8390000000004
territ why would you post that who cares

2907.76 --> 2912.0
don't you think we've had enough of all

2909.44 --> 2915.839
that by now

2912.0 --> 2915.839
everybody's sick of hearing about it

2917.2 --> 2928.16
oh i'm sick of hearing about it let's

2919.119 --> 2930.6400000000003
just be more precise

2928.16 --> 2943.839
hey absolute flat earth vodka happy new

2930.64 --> 2943.839
year to you too

2957.28 --> 2962.4
can't wait for your immune system to get

2959.44 --> 2962.4
hacked okay

2965.359 --> 2971.839
i i don't know how would that work

2974.48 --> 2988.64
yeah hello sir check oh by the way

2985.04 --> 2990.48
right it was kind of funny

2988.64 --> 2993.5989999999997
yeah yesterday in the conversation

2990.48 --> 2993.599
before it went sour

2993.92 --> 2997.52
was it like a guy that was like

2995.96 --> 3000.48
spiritually

2997.52 --> 3001.2
developed i guess but it just really

3000.48 --> 3003.76
stood out

3001.2 --> 3006.0789999999997
like what he was doing i the process was

3003.76 --> 3010.0
familiar i've been there

3006.079 --> 3014.4
and he was just exoterizing

3010.0 --> 3016.72
making esoteric like the spiritual

3014.4 --> 3019.44
entities what they were and he's

3016.72 --> 3021.52
apparently seen that even in

3019.44 --> 3023.04
i guess drug experience or maybe dream

3021.52 --> 3023.7599999999998
experience he wasn't too sure so he had

3023.04 --> 3025.92
his own like

3023.76 --> 3028.2400000000002
dark world type situation going but he

3025.92 --> 3030.96
was just so ingrained about

3028.24 --> 3030.9599999999996
how it was

3031.28 --> 3035.92
so he was just exoterrorizing it and

3034.24 --> 3038.24
i've always tried to be

3035.92 --> 3039.04
purely esoteric because every time you

3038.24 --> 3041.839
try to

3039.04 --> 3041.839
put it down

3042.559 --> 3045.44
you get stuck

3045.599 --> 3049.44
you just say it is this very

3047.44 --> 3052.0
specifically you tend to get stuck in

3049.44 --> 3052.0
there because

3052.72 --> 3057.359
context in the spiritual realm context

3055.2 --> 3059.4399999999996
and where you're at spiritually it just

3057.359 --> 3061.44
tends to change things you see other

3059.44 --> 3063.68
things in it and if you

3061.44 --> 3065.28
stick it all down to its very specific

3063.68 --> 3067.9199999999996
type of way

3065.28 --> 3070.2400000000002
then you stay stuck in that you it holds

3067.92 --> 3072.4
you down from growing further

3070.24 --> 3074.8799999999997
so i've always tried an esoteric

3072.4 --> 3075.599
approach for everything i've experienced

3074.88 --> 3078.88
instead

3075.599 --> 3081.839
and emphasize on that and that way

3078.88 --> 3083.92
i can keep developing and and still stay

3081.839 --> 3088.4
persistent

3083.92 --> 3088.4
and consistent as much as i can

3089.599 --> 3094.559
and i hope to get recognition for that

3092.48 --> 3096.079
and people are not just brushing past it

3094.559 --> 3097.2000000000003
and it's like yeah yeah sure man just

3096.079 --> 3099.92
keep going

3097.2 --> 3100.96
we don't know this is because i'm not

3099.92 --> 3105.119
too sure either

3100.96 --> 3107.92
like i'm often just looking at myself

3105.119 --> 3108.88
and everything that's happening and it's

3107.92 --> 3112.4
like

3108.88 --> 3113.2000000000003
is this good is this actually what i

3112.4 --> 3115.44
think it is

3113.2 --> 3116.64
is are the things that i think are

3115.44 --> 3118.8
happening to me are they

3116.64 --> 3120.5589999999997
actually happening or is that my mind

3118.8 --> 3125.6800000000003
idealizing it

3120.559 --> 3128.4
you know because

3125.68 --> 3129.2
it's a big experiment what i'm doing

3128.4 --> 3132.0
this is like

3129.2 --> 3132.48
yeah my life choice where i'm going it's

3132.0 --> 3134.96
to me

3132.48 --> 3136.88
also a big experiment as to what is this

3134.96 --> 3138.96
what is going on how does this work what

3136.88 --> 3141.04
are the wisest choices

3138.96 --> 3143.68
i have to test it i'm trying to be

3141.04 --> 3146.24
empiric on a spiritual level

3143.68 --> 3147.1189999999997
like is this real is this assumption

3146.24 --> 3150.8799999999997
really real

3147.119 --> 3152.8
i have to test it by what standard do i

3150.88 --> 3156.4
test it well

3152.8 --> 3156.4
by the logos standard

3158.64 --> 3163.04
that that's like the foundation approach

3161.44 --> 3165.88
to me

3163.04 --> 3168.88
just that there is more moral

3165.88 --> 3168.88
specificity

3169.04 --> 3176.88
and the balance between the ego

3172.4 --> 3178.88
and god and what that does to you how it

3176.88 --> 3180.079
changes perspective on things and

3178.88 --> 3184.079
everything

3180.079 --> 3187.8390000000004
so yeah it's complicated

3184.079 --> 3187.8390000000004
anyway what are you talking about said

3192.839 --> 3195.839
chico

3197.52 --> 3203.2
okay sir check oh that's weird

3201.359 --> 3205.2
well it's all very cute but i'm not

3203.2 --> 3208.0789999999997
gonna take any vaccine

3205.2 --> 3209.9199999999996
so i don't give a [ __ ] whether like a

3208.079 --> 3211.8390000000004
hundred new inventions of

3209.92 --> 3223.839
possibilities or whatever i'm just not

3211.839 --> 3223.839
gonna take it

3234.4 --> 3241.2000000000003
sound is effective against illness

3237.52 --> 3241.2
depends on the frequency of the sound

3247.92 --> 3252.16
and on the like the the moment in your

3251.2 --> 3256.0789999999997
sickness they're

3252.16 --> 3259.2
like yeah sound can be stimulating

3256.079 --> 3261.599
but it can also be nerve-wracking

3259.2 --> 3264.5589999999997
so it all depends on where you're at in

3261.599 --> 3278.319
your yeah in the metabolic situation

3264.559 --> 3281.599
of an illness cycle

3278.319 --> 3281.599
ghost frequency

3281.92 --> 3284.48
okay

3285.2 --> 3293.839
if you say so absolute flutter fault guy

3288.24 --> 3293.839
i don't that doesn't ring a bell that

3304.839 --> 3307.839
frequency

3308.23 --> 3311.44
[Music]

3311.92 --> 3321.839
okay well fluttershy maybe i will look

3314.16 --> 3321.839
that up

3332.839 --> 3349.839
ultrasound what

3356.4 --> 3363.839
okay that sounds extremely unhealthy

3380.24 --> 3383.68
oh well maybe it's not unhealthy but i i

3382.4 --> 3385.6800000000003
don't why would you

3383.68 --> 3386.96
want to do that well yeah ooh because

3385.68 --> 3390.16
it's special

3386.96 --> 3392.559
i don't know man that's

3390.16 --> 3392.5589999999997
weird

3396.799 --> 3405.839
hey guns have never owned rnp good to

3399.119 --> 3405.839
see you happy new year to you too

3418.96 --> 3423.68
but yeah you know what that ghost

3420.64 --> 3433.839
frequency i'll actually ask

3423.68 --> 3433.839
my healer about that

3437.28 --> 3442.0
listen what he has to say about it

3439.76 --> 3443.6800000000003
whether it is nefarious or just a waste

3442.0 --> 3446.24
of time or

3443.68 --> 3448.5589999999997
maybe it is actually good maybe it's i

3446.24 --> 3448.5589999999997
don't know

3449.119 --> 3461.839
what is it well

3474.24 --> 3478.0789999999997
apparently on the internet there's a

3476.079 --> 3479.8390000000004
thing that ghost frequency and it is

3478.079 --> 3481.2000000000003
claimed and there's videos about it that

3479.839 --> 3483.52
if you listen to this

3481.2 --> 3486.799
frequency you will start to have

3483.52 --> 3490.0
paranormal experience in ghost sightings

3486.799 --> 3492.24
so i don't know maybe that is a thing

3490.0 --> 3492.24
i

3493.599 --> 3497.3590000000004
so there's now the ultimate ghost

3495.359 --> 3503.839
hunters experience

3497.359 --> 3503.839
i guess

3509.92 --> 3513.28
right here we go again that's what i

3512.079 --> 3515.6800000000003
thought but this is just

3513.28 --> 3517.3590000000004
this like oh that somebody found out

3515.68 --> 3519.44
another ouija board

3517.359 --> 3520.96
this thing to screw around with that's

3519.44 --> 3523.44
pretty much what this sounds like

3520.96 --> 3525.2
like oh look you can see he goes oh so

3523.44 --> 3525.68
some stupid kids are going to get drunk

3525.2 --> 3529.2
and [ __ ]

3525.68 --> 3531.68
like oh let's do that oh ghost oh

3529.2 --> 3534.0789999999997
yeah it's just stupid [ __ ] that's really

3531.68 --> 3538.0
what it sounds like to me but

3534.079 --> 3539.76
who knows man i haven't tried it i'm not

3538.0 --> 3540.88
gonna try it but i'm gonna ask my healer

3539.76 --> 3544.1600000000003
about it

3540.88 --> 3549.119
if he's heard of that

3544.16 --> 3549.1189999999997
why why would i try that

3552.96 --> 3558.079
look maybe it does kind of like take

3556.0 --> 3560.88
away the veil

3558.079 --> 3562.96
where you get closer to just yeah seeing

3560.88 --> 3566.2400000000002
spirits and all that

3562.96 --> 3566.2400000000002
why would you do that

3567.04 --> 3573.839
it shows the world isn't what

3579.92 --> 3585.52
no now the more you're talking about it

3582.48 --> 3588.88
the less i want to try it

3585.52 --> 3600.64
sounds pretty dramatic and i don't think

3588.88 --> 3602.48
i need to do that

3600.64 --> 3604.48
because it basically just sounds like

3602.48 --> 3606.88
using like psychotropic drugs or

3604.48 --> 3606.88
something

3607.44 --> 3610.88
oh you will start to lose yeah well

3609.04 --> 3615.839
there you go why the hell would i want

3610.88 --> 3615.839
to do that

3621.48 --> 3624.889
[Music]

3625.92 --> 3632.96
i don't need to hallucinate to be

3629.44 --> 3635.68
pre yeah aware of spirits and all that

3632.96 --> 3636.88
and energies i don't need that thank you

3635.68 --> 3643.839
very much

3636.88 --> 3643.839
it's just a big distraction

3654.839 --> 3657.839
ugh

3688.88 --> 3693.6800000000003
right so yeah you may be all

3691.839 --> 3698.0
enthusiastic about i'm not going to do

3693.68 --> 3701.1189999999997
anything with that until i've consulted

3698.0 --> 3705.2
my healer about it probably does

3701.119 --> 3707.599
know about it maybe he doesn't

3705.2 --> 3708.319
because yeah so far it just sounds like

3707.599 --> 3710.839
oh

3708.319 --> 3712.079
it's it's just like taking

3710.839 --> 3714.88
hallucinogenics

3712.079 --> 3716.6400000000003
i i don't really feel a need to i try to

3714.88 --> 3719.44
stay away from that sort of thing as

3716.64 --> 3719.44
much as i can

3719.599 --> 3723.52
like i'm already using cannabis which

3722.559 --> 3727.76
makes me like

3723.52 --> 3729.839
more sensitive in general that's already

3727.76 --> 3732.0
good enough and sometimes even a little

3729.839 --> 3735.44
punishing so

3732.0 --> 3737.2
i don't need any other the influences

3735.44 --> 3740.559
like that

3737.2 --> 3743.5989999999997
ayahuasca is not good for you well

3740.559 --> 3743.599
it's complicated

3746.319 --> 3753.119
sex sterling it's it's just

3749.359 --> 3756.5589999999997
complicated i don't recommend it

3753.119 --> 3759.039
but it is a pretty special thing

3756.559 --> 3760.7200000000003
but you just got to be very careful with

3759.039 --> 3763.3590000000004
it

3760.72 --> 3766.839
take it very serious and don't just use

3763.359 --> 3769.839
it like a party drug or something that's

3766.839 --> 3769.839
insane

3772.16 --> 3779.5989999999997
ayahuasca that is but to say

3775.52 --> 3779.599
it's not good for you i disagree because

3779.68 --> 3783.839
we still got some firework left

3785.2 --> 3788.72
because it can also be used so i heard

3787.92 --> 3790.799
for

3788.72 --> 3793.7599999999998
healing applications and for bringing

3790.799 --> 3793.7599999999998
people that are just

3794.0 --> 3800.96
in a bad place back into a good place

3797.44 --> 3802.0
so to say universally it is not good for

3800.96 --> 3804.96
you

3802.0 --> 3805.92
no but it should be taken very seriously

3804.96 --> 3810.319
and not

3805.92 --> 3813.44
as some kind of party drug that's insane

3810.319 --> 3814.64
because it can be very dangerous like it

3813.44 --> 3824.64
can

3814.64 --> 3826.96
screw you up

3824.64 --> 3828.8799999999997
suit you you've never tried that zack

3826.96 --> 3832.079
sterling

3828.88 --> 3836.079
well no if you've been able to

3832.079 --> 3836.079
go around without it why would you try

3836.839 --> 3839.839
it

3855.44 --> 3858.799
why did i try it

3859.039 --> 3867.8390000000004
what did i try what

3869.039 --> 3874.1600000000003
it makes me more sensitive yeah that's

3870.88 --> 3874.1600000000003
what it does with me

3876.079 --> 3882.88
but that can as i said also be kind of a

3879.28 --> 3882.88
dangerous unnerving thing

3885.599 --> 3892.2400000000002
it's just that i've just

3888.96 --> 3895.839
become a cannabis smoker they

3892.24 --> 3895.839
kind of became that pretty young already

3896.0 --> 3904.72
and for the person that i am it

3899.839 --> 3906.319
it just it works kind of nice on average

3904.72 --> 3908.0
although there's people that enjoy it

3906.319 --> 3909.7599999999998
even more than i do

3908.0 --> 3912.319
but yeah cannabis has a different

3909.76 --> 3914.3190000000004
influence on almost everyone

3912.319 --> 3915.92
you can't really predict what it does to

3914.319 --> 3919.359
you

3915.92 --> 3921.52
as in what turn it will take

3919.359 --> 3922.88
typically with the individual in the

3921.52 --> 3925.2
experience because there's all kinds of

3922.88 --> 3927.839
things that can happen

3925.2 --> 3929.2799999999997
and sometimes like it's widely varied

3927.839 --> 3931.2799999999997
what happens

3929.28 --> 3933.28
or very intense what happens and with

3931.28 --> 3934.7200000000003
some people it just gets very specific

3933.28 --> 3938.559
and even almost kind of boring

3934.72 --> 3940.9599999999996
or they just get sick some people don't

3938.559 --> 3940.96
like it

3943.839 --> 3947.7599999999998
i don't know zack sterling why are you

3946.24 --> 3949.7599999999998
what are you need drugs

3947.76 --> 3953.119
oh you're looking for a drug to start

3949.76 --> 3955.5200000000004
using this what are you doing

3953.119 --> 3956.319
don't do drugs if you're not doing drugs

3955.52 --> 3959.119
then why

3956.319 --> 3960.64
the hell would you go looking out for

3959.119 --> 3962.88
drugs to do what is this

3960.64 --> 3965.839
this is bad i thought you were becoming

3962.88 --> 3965.839
a christian

3978.48 --> 3984.0
what is jengam what are you talking

3981.68 --> 3984.0
about

3990.88 --> 3999.039
no for health well if it's for health

3994.72 --> 3999.0389999999998
then why don't you just try cbd oil

4004.24 --> 4009.839
but zack sterling you seem like

4007.68 --> 4011.44
since i you got in here you should see

4009.839 --> 4013.839
seemed like a pretty light-hearted

4011.44 --> 4013.839
person

4014.48 --> 4018.48
why would you start taking smoking

4017.28 --> 4020.88
cannabis for that ex

4018.48 --> 4023.44
like do you have an overabundance of

4020.88 --> 4027.039
stress that is like burdening your body

4023.44 --> 4029.2000000000003
you need to relax your body in order to

4027.039 --> 4030.96
get through it is that your situation

4029.2 --> 4032.3999999999996
yeah then i might say okay well maybe

4030.96 --> 4034.2400000000002
try cannabis

4032.4 --> 4036.0
you don't seem like a person in that

4034.24 --> 4041.359
position at all

4036.0 --> 4044.48
so i don't know why you're being so

4041.359 --> 4044.48
curious about this

4047.839 --> 4051.0389999999998
uh who

4051.599 --> 4054.4
what is this

4055.599 --> 4062.48
absolutely why are you even bringing

4057.76 --> 4064.7990000000004
that up

4062.48 --> 4066.319
okay yeah enough terrible suggestions

4064.799 --> 4068.079
already one more of these and i'm

4066.319 --> 4071.2
banning you

4068.079 --> 4073.28
the [ __ ] is this this is not like

4071.2 --> 4075.4399999999996
i don't want my chat to become a giant

4073.28 --> 4080.1600000000003
list of terrible suggestions

4075.44 --> 4080.16
thank you very much stop it now

4089.44 --> 4094.079
yeah so stop giving a list of terrible

4092.64 --> 4105.839
things to try out

4094.079 --> 4105.839
thanks absolute flat earth vodka

4107.199 --> 4110.799
yeah there's a million ways to poison

4109.279 --> 4113.040000000001
yourself to death

4110.799 --> 4119.839
and create all kinds of damage you don't

4113.04 --> 4119.839
need to give everybody a list of it

4128.88 --> 4138.08
you're new you're middle aged

4133.04 --> 4138.08
so you're at 40 or something or in your

4144.839 --> 4147.839
30s

4148.88 --> 4152.400000000001
look in general the only reason why i

4151.04 --> 4155.04
would tell

4152.4 --> 4156.159
or advise people to like start cannabis

4155.04 --> 4160.0
is if they had

4156.159 --> 4163.04
physical 54 wow

4160.0 --> 4163.759
all right well do you have physical

4163.04 --> 4166.4
problems

4163.759 --> 4168.319
that cannabis could solve well yeah you

4166.4 --> 4171.3589999999995
might want to try it

4168.319 --> 4174.719
it's a lot of burdens

4171.359 --> 4176.799
like subtle pains or just yeah then it

4174.719 --> 4178.799
might help you

4176.799 --> 4181.04
but that's really the only reason why i

4178.799 --> 4185.04
would recommend it for spiritual issues

4181.04 --> 4189.839
no not at all

4185.04 --> 4189.839
you don't need that

4202.4 --> 4205.679
solve the problems or hide the symptoms

4204.32 --> 4208.159
will sometimes also

4205.679 --> 4209.92
solve the problem say gecko because if

4208.159 --> 4211.759999999999
you have strain in your body then

4209.92 --> 4214.08
cannabis will

4211.76 --> 4216.2390000000005
undo some of that strain and that will

4214.08 --> 4218.32
literally give your body an opportunity

4216.239 --> 4219.5199999999995
to heal and then also there is of course

4218.32 --> 4221.84
the

4219.52 --> 4223.679
cannabinoid effects the special

4221.84 --> 4226.8
receptors that will

4223.679 --> 4230.719
probably heal

4226.8 --> 4231.6
your body even better regenerating

4230.719 --> 4234.96
capability

4231.6 --> 4236.8
to a certain extent it has that in it it

4234.96 --> 4238.88
will not make you younger but it will

4236.8 --> 4240.400000000001
just help your body resolve issues

4238.88 --> 4243.36
better

4240.4 --> 4245.04
it's yeah i could even say like help

4243.36 --> 4248.0
against cancer and all that

4245.04 --> 4250.4
if you have that if you have something

4248.0 --> 4250.4
happening

4253.6 --> 4259.84
you're feeling immortal and

4264.8 --> 4273.84
so you'd use it as a medicine then

4268.88 --> 4273.84
yes it is a medicine

4293.92 --> 4297.52
all right if you're feeling mortal you

4296.159 --> 4301.599999999999
want to go to heaven

4297.52 --> 4303.280000000001
so does that mean you want to forget

4301.6 --> 4304.96
that's why you're looking for drugs to

4303.28 --> 4307.84
forget all this [ __ ] out there

4304.96 --> 4307.84
that's not going to help

4308.8 --> 4313.28
if you want to go to heaven then you

4310.48 --> 4314.959999999999
have to build it

4313.28 --> 4317.28
you have to build yourself you just keep

4314.96 --> 4319.92
on building

4317.28 --> 4322.5599999999995
drugs are on average just gonna distract

4319.92 --> 4322.56
you from that

4323.04 --> 4327.6
you have to confront yourself first with

4324.719 --> 4330.4800000000005
what is real and then just

4327.6 --> 4333.4400000000005
let it happen learn to accept that it is

4330.48 --> 4333.44
real and then

4333.76 --> 4343.84
then eventually the longing for escapism

4336.239 --> 4343.839999999999
will go away

4350.56 --> 4354.96
this is the first time i ever thought

4352.159 --> 4354.96
about death what

4355.6 --> 4358.64
never thought about it

4368.84 --> 4371.84
okay

4374.64 --> 4385.84
so is there any reason why you're

4376.4 --> 4385.839999999999
thinking about it

4389.84 --> 4392.96
i'm trying to find some esoteric angle

4392.239 --> 4395.12
here you know

4392.96 --> 4396.08
trying to figure it out just saying

4395.12 --> 4399.199
you're doing this

4396.08 --> 4402.64
you're doing that that doesn't really

4399.199 --> 4402.639999999999
explain why it's happening

4409.04 --> 4414.88
he brought up drug yeah flatter thought

4412.64 --> 4414.88
god

4425.04 --> 4429.92
yeah that's also a reason why i don't

4427.92 --> 4431.6
like to bring that up especially in like

4429.92 --> 4436.8
a morning show like this it's just

4431.6 --> 4440.719
like i'll bring up medicine sure

4436.8 --> 4444.159000000001
medical applications but like

4440.719 --> 4455.84
drugs to have special experiences

4444.159 --> 4455.839999999999
like why

4475.44 --> 4478.5599999999995
okay sex sterling

4480.84 --> 4483.84
hmm

4487.28 --> 4497.84
this guy makes me uncomfortable

4503.92 --> 4508.0
all right well maybe look maybe you're

4506.159 --> 4510.239
just in a

4508.0 --> 4512.08
in a down moment right now maybe that's

4510.239 --> 4515.759999999999
never happened before

4512.08 --> 4518.239
but look my dad is like

4515.76 --> 4519.1990000000005
like i think he's like 70 or something

4518.239 --> 4523.44
now

4519.199 --> 4526.0
and he is still very vibrant

4523.44 --> 4527.44
like he's yeah he's slowing down a

4526.0 --> 4529.84
little but he's still

4527.44 --> 4531.36
very active very sharp and he has

4529.84 --> 4535.6
learned so much he's like

4531.36 --> 4537.599999999999
really wise so

4535.6 --> 4539.04
yeah growing old is not what you think

4537.6 --> 4541.76
it is like

4539.04 --> 4544.08
one thing gets tougher the other thing

4541.76 --> 4546.719
gets better and it really does

4544.08 --> 4548.88
it's important that you surrender to

4546.719 --> 4550.719
that side

4548.88 --> 4552.0
and not care as much about the other

4550.719 --> 4554.2390000000005
side anymore because there's really

4552.0 --> 4555.76
nothing you can do about it you can just

4554.239 --> 4558.5599999999995
try to

4555.76 --> 4559.1990000000005
slow down the decay as much as you can

4558.56 --> 4562.2390000000005
in the

4559.199 --> 4566.159
most efficient way that you can envision

4562.239 --> 4568.0
that's it

4566.159 --> 4570.0
don't be demoralized about what is

4568.0 --> 4572.08
inevitable because that was there from

4570.0 --> 4573.92
the start

4572.08 --> 4581.84
it's just entropy there's nothing you

4573.92 --> 4581.84
can do about it

4582.74 --> 4586.13
[Music]

4596.08 --> 4602.0
right it's not just challenges though

4599.76 --> 4605.52
absolute flattered vodka there's also

4602.0 --> 4608.56
rewards there is rewards in growing

4605.52 --> 4612.159000000001
older and wiser as long as you don't

4608.56 --> 4612.56
like don't give up on the spiritual

4612.159 --> 4615.92
don't

4612.56 --> 4617.679
like just become a drone in society

4615.92 --> 4622.64
if you don't give up your spirit then

4617.679 --> 4627.84
there is continuous rewards

4622.64 --> 4631.360000000001
when you get older it is it is there

4627.84 --> 4637.84
so it's not as terrible

4631.36 --> 4637.839999999999
as is generally assumed

4641.52 --> 4645.280000000001
right but it's also the rewards are

4644.48 --> 4648.08
rewards

4645.28 --> 4651.84
that often are not even properly

4648.08 --> 4651.84
understood by the young

4653.04 --> 4656.719
that's why it's typical saying youth is

4655.04 --> 4659.04
wasted on the young

4656.719 --> 4660.96
because they don't know how to

4659.04 --> 4664.48
appreciate it properly they're just

4660.96 --> 4669.28
wild and take things for granted

4664.48 --> 4671.199
when you grow older it's yeah

4669.28 --> 4673.759999999999
you appreciate the things that you do

4671.199 --> 4678.08
get a lot more and that is very valuable

4673.76 --> 4680.719
if you just do that

4678.08 --> 4681.199
like you can literally learn to get more

4680.719 --> 4683.28
joy

4681.199 --> 4684.96
out of the same things that way back

4683.28 --> 4687.12
you've taken for granted

4684.96 --> 4688.56
and do not underestimate the energy that

4687.12 --> 4691.84
comes from that

4688.56 --> 4692.320000000001
and the inspiration like really yeah it

4691.84 --> 4706.64
just

4692.32 --> 4708.32
condenses more becomes more compact

4706.64 --> 4710.159000000001
ah they think they are entitled the

4708.32 --> 4713.28
young ones well technically they are

4710.159 --> 4715.199
in a way they are the future

4713.28 --> 4716.96
they just don't have the faculties to

4715.199 --> 4718.159
realize

4716.96 --> 4721.28
what that all means and the

4718.159 --> 4725.759999999999
responsibility that comes with it

4721.28 --> 4725.759999999999
but their spirit is already feeling it

4730.96 --> 4736.08
or entitled maybe that's yeah it's not

4733.199 --> 4736.08
exactly what i meant

4739.04 --> 4744.4
or maybe it is depends on the context of

4741.28 --> 4744.4
what you mean within title

4746.719 --> 4750.8
right but the young also always

4748.48 --> 4754.718999999999
underestimate just

4750.8 --> 4758.08
the wisdom of the elder in ways

4754.719 --> 4758.08
because they

4758.239 --> 4763.839999999999
don't have the patience they don't want

4760.239 --> 4763.839999999999
to wait up

4779.6 --> 4784.08
all right anyway anybody else still left

4783.44 --> 4786.239
in chat

4784.08 --> 4790.0
except zack sterling an absolute flat

4786.239 --> 4793.28
earth vodka anybody else here

4790.0 --> 4793.28
it's been over 10 minutes

4797.28 --> 4805.84
ah there you are sir chico

4809.199 --> 4814.159
oh yeah that was crazy by the way there

4810.8 --> 4819.84
was like a car on fire

4814.159 --> 4823.28
over there like really on fire blazing

4819.84 --> 4823.28
and then eventually the uh

4823.6 --> 4829.84
the fire fire truck

4826.639 --> 4830.2390000000005
came and put it out but that thing was

4829.84 --> 4833.76
like

4830.239 --> 4838.799999999999
really on fire not just

4833.76 --> 4840.8
yeah crazy people

4838.8 --> 4842.320000000001
i'm glad it didn't stink up the place

4840.8 --> 4844.159000000001
too bad because the other

4842.32 --> 4847.84
rubber and [ __ ] it's really terrible

4844.159 --> 4847.839999999999
smoke so

4848.32 --> 4851.12
a rubbish

4856.719 --> 4863.199
right yeah it's also now of course

4860.159 --> 4864.08
january so you have the january is

4863.199 --> 4866.08
always

4864.08 --> 4868.0
especially like the first two weeks it's

4866.08 --> 4871.28
always like oh

4868.0 --> 4874.639
the holiday season is over

4871.28 --> 4877.12
it's like

4874.639 --> 4878.719
post-holiday season depression doesn't

4877.12 --> 4881.76
have to get really bad

4878.719 --> 4883.28
but a lot of people do get a little bit

4881.76 --> 4889.84
more sensitive to it

4883.28 --> 4889.84
i guess so maybe that's what's going on

4890.0 --> 4894.08
for me it doesn't really happen that

4891.6 --> 4895.1990000000005
much it's just more smeared out it's

4894.08 --> 4897.84
really when

4895.199 --> 4898.879999999999
it kind of starts in in late november

4897.84 --> 4901.4400000000005
usually

4898.88 --> 4903.12
or early november depending on what

4901.44 --> 4906.32
happens

4903.12 --> 4908.48
and then when the light starts to return

4906.32 --> 4910.08
then it decreases it really is a direct

4908.48 --> 4911.44
correlation with just the amount of

4910.08 --> 4913.84
sunlight out there

4911.44 --> 4913.839999999999
for me

4914.56 --> 4918.320000000001
but because i got like really sick and

4916.8 --> 4921.4400000000005
all that happened and

4918.32 --> 4925.84
rejuvenated from the not eating

4921.44 --> 4925.839999999999
was what is it five days

4926.0 --> 4932.159
being sick for seven days

4929.04 --> 4935.92
that kind of like

4932.159 --> 4938.5599999999995
yeah made its own cycle

4935.92 --> 4939.52
with a lot of energy at the start so

4938.56 --> 4943.360000000001
that kind of like

4939.52 --> 4945.92
broke the normal decreasing getting

4943.36 --> 4948.799999999999
slightly more depressed i guess because

4945.92 --> 4952.32
of the dying of the light

4948.8 --> 4959.84
it kind of like did that in its place

4952.32 --> 4959.84
for me

4970.08 --> 4974.159
all right so yeah 30 more minutes for

4971.84 --> 4974.159000000001
the show

4975.04 --> 4987.84
yeah i'll be back in two minutes

5094.48 --> 5099.839999999999
get down

5102.96 --> 5106.2390000000005
yeah they really well there there's

5104.88 --> 5108.56
always the next

5106.239 --> 5110.5599999999995
morning there's always just people with

5108.56 --> 5113.92
fireworks left because a lot of them

5110.56 --> 5116.56
are just like kids that have just

5113.92 --> 5116.56
bags of

5117.04 --> 5122.239
like explosive fireworks and they always

5120.4 --> 5124.638999999999
have stuff left and then the next day

5122.239 --> 5124.638999999999
they just

5124.8 --> 5128.2390000000005
keep on going walking around and doing

5127.12 --> 5130.5599999999995
that until they're

5128.239 --> 5130.5599999999995
done

5131.52 --> 5136.4800000000005
i used to do that too when i was a kid

5137.28 --> 5142.239
even though it's supposed to be

5138.56 --> 5142.2390000000005
forbidden it's just

5160.159 --> 5164.159
blue jays are highlighted

5166.84 --> 5169.84
huh

5173.199 --> 5183.839999999999
hello iron fe by the way

5188.4 --> 5192.4
yeah happy new year again everyone i

5190.4 --> 5196.159
hope that

5192.4 --> 5199.599999999999
everybody had a nice transition and a

5196.159 --> 5201.5199999999995
bit of party there was by the way

5199.6 --> 5203.92
my neighbors they were having like a

5201.52 --> 5207.84
dance party a very loud music

5203.92 --> 5209.76
like they really put on it hard

5207.84 --> 5211.1990000000005
and i got kind of invited on there too

5209.76 --> 5215.1990000000005
but i didn't go because

5211.199 --> 5218.32
just like the music was just terrible

5215.199 --> 5222.159
it's just standard it's i can't i

5218.32 --> 5222.159
couldn't it was too loud anyway

5222.48 --> 5230.638999999999
but i feel like oh i'm such a reclusive

5226.88 --> 5231.6
terrible i feel guilty towards the guy

5230.639 --> 5235.04
because

5231.6 --> 5237.360000000001
yeah he's a nice guy

5235.04 --> 5240.08
and like they are not bad people but

5237.36 --> 5242.799999999999
it's just not my thing not my style

5240.08 --> 5242.8
anymore

5244.8 --> 5253.84
or maybe i'm just being way too nitpicky

5254.4 --> 5258.48
but anyway i didn't really feel like oh

5256.4 --> 5260.799999999999
yeah party

5258.48 --> 5262.959999999999
too much i just want it nice and calm

5260.8 --> 5262.96
and

5263.04 --> 5267.84
just enjoy the sights

5271.44 --> 5274.48
and then have a really good night rest

5273.12 --> 5277.12
and i did i did

5274.48 --> 5278.0
really sleep really well though even

5277.12 --> 5279.76
though at first

5278.0 --> 5281.12
yeah they were still doing fireworks

5279.76 --> 5282.56
like in the middle of the night four

5281.12 --> 5283.36
o'clock at night and all that that was

5282.56 --> 5284.96
kind of annoying

5283.36 --> 5287.28
because they did it pretty close by

5284.96 --> 5290.159
pretty much the same distance as

5287.28 --> 5292.4
what you've been hearing or yeah over

5290.159 --> 5292.4
there

5293.12 --> 5297.36
there's the same corner as where they

5295.28 --> 5298.32
burned that car so that's just like a

5297.36 --> 5301.04
firework

5298.32 --> 5304.08
enthusiasm zone where the kids

5301.04 --> 5309.84
apparently come together to do that [ __ ]

5304.08 --> 5309.84
good to know

5310.48 --> 5315.04
yes your chico for me too it was weird i

5312.8 --> 5319.12
was going out yesterday just looking for

5315.04 --> 5321.04
fire fury for cope and there was nothing

5319.12 --> 5323.84
then i heard it was illegal it's

5321.04 --> 5323.84
ridiculous

5324.8 --> 5329.04
but yeah despite that holy [ __ ] there

5328.639 --> 5331.76
was

5329.04 --> 5333.84
plenty of fireworks out there and pretty

5331.76 --> 5336.320000000001
pretty spectacular ones too

5333.84 --> 5338.8
like i've seen some really spectacular

5336.32 --> 5342.48
fireworks that i've never seen before

5338.8 --> 5344.8
like this giant veil

5342.48 --> 5345.599999999999
of glittery firework that would just

5344.8 --> 5348.719
hang around

5345.6 --> 5352.0
as a veil for very long it's an

5348.719 --> 5352.0
incredible sight

5352.08 --> 5355.76
amazing fireworks out there

5360.88 --> 5365.12
so i don't know where they got it but

5363.52 --> 5368.320000000001
they did have it

5365.12 --> 5371.5199999999995
maybe they all imported it

5368.32 --> 5373.44
maybe i don't know maybe they sold it

5371.52 --> 5379.84
underground a lot among colleagues or

5373.44 --> 5379.839999999999
something i i don't know how it works

5381.92 --> 5397.09
and many just shoot their guns off

5393.28 --> 5397.09
[Music]

5401.52 --> 5406.0
i ever thrown cece or metal in water

5404.239 --> 5411.12
well i personally have never done

5406.0 --> 5411.12
that but in chemistry class

5411.52 --> 5415.4400000000005
yes that was demonstrated to me

5416.8 --> 5424.08
like we had a a chemist teacher

5420.159 --> 5426.4
was very much a fan of explosive stuff

5424.08 --> 5428.239
so every time some kind of demonstration

5426.4 --> 5429.04
with dangerous chemicals explosive

5428.239 --> 5431.599999999999
things

5429.04 --> 5432.56
oh yeah you bet he was at the core of it

5431.6 --> 5435.360000000001
and he had all the

5432.56 --> 5436.56
permits and all that to do that it was

5435.36 --> 5438.32
always good like oh

5436.56 --> 5440.080000000001
he's going to do something that means

5438.32 --> 5441.199
something is going to explode or

5440.08 --> 5449.44
something

5441.199 --> 5451.919999999999
it is always a lot of fun

5449.44 --> 5455.28
but yeah cesium i think it had been

5451.92 --> 5455.28
demonstrated to me yes

5459.92 --> 5468.08
and also these the the other

5464.56 --> 5470.96
slightly less explosive metals that

5468.08 --> 5470.96
react with water

5471.04 --> 5474.32
slow burning the pretty rapid burning

5473.36 --> 5478.32
and then yeah the

5474.32 --> 5478.32
cesium is is quite explosive

5485.97 --> 5491.84
[Music]

5487.12 --> 5491.84
this is zac sterling that's hilarious

5500.0 --> 5504.56
shooting airplanes have to account for

5502.239 --> 5505.759999999999
where the moon gravity is stronger or

5504.56 --> 5509.280000000001
weaker

5505.76 --> 5511.6
no not really

5509.28 --> 5512.96
i think airplanes would have to account

5511.6 --> 5518.8
much more for the

5512.96 --> 5520.4
supposed curve that they're flying over

5518.8 --> 5522.639
i think that is much more of an issue

5520.4 --> 5522.638999999999
because

5523.12 --> 5528.239
because airplanes go fast it's much more

5525.6 --> 5532.400000000001
about just where the air layers are

5528.239 --> 5535.44
and your orientation because gravity is

5532.4 --> 5538.239
overcome remember by

5535.44 --> 5539.44
airplanes and like birds they overcome

5538.239 --> 5544.638999999999
gravity

5539.44 --> 5546.159
by just playing into the aerodynamics

5544.639 --> 5548.159000000001
ah and i'm talking from a baller

5546.159 --> 5550.638999999999
perspective but that's technically

5548.159 --> 5551.36
yeah with relative density it's the same

5550.639 --> 5554.32
just because

5551.36 --> 5554.32
because of the motion

5554.56 --> 5561.84
there's lift from the air

5569.679 --> 5575.84
hey george sanford by the way happy new

5573.12 --> 5575.84
year to you

5577.28 --> 5582.08
what about a hot air balloon well hot

5579.44 --> 5582.08
air balloons

5583.199 --> 5589.36
just are less dense so

5586.239 --> 5592.638999999999
gravity doesn't really

5589.36 --> 5594.5599999999995
influence that like the air

5592.639 --> 5595.679
is not just going to change because the

5594.56 --> 5599.6
moon's gravity

5595.679 --> 5603.12
is there because

5599.6 --> 5605.04
it's too far away to countermand the

5603.12 --> 5607.28
earth's gravity so the influence is

5605.04 --> 5611.44
going to be minimal oh god

5607.28 --> 5611.44
you caught me balls planing it

5611.85 --> 5617.280000000001
[Music]

5613.44 --> 5617.28
yeah balls planing it's

5618.239 --> 5631.839999999999
it's a thing

5636.32 --> 5639.84
is that a squirt in a way

5640.0 --> 5643.44
it's just what heliocentrist believers

5642.8 --> 5646.4800000000005
tend to do

5643.44 --> 5648.4
ball splaining you know just get into

5646.48 --> 5652.5599999999995
the habit of

5648.4 --> 5656.638999999999
trying to justify things

5652.56 --> 5656.639
in their model which they reify into

5656.84 --> 5659.84
reality

5663.92 --> 5673.84
but you do get it red balls flaming

5684.239 --> 5688.48
yeah and you could say that even among

5686.239 --> 5690.879999999999
the more reification side

5688.48 --> 5693.5199999999995
of the flat earthers there could be flat

5690.88 --> 5695.76
splaining too

5693.52 --> 5700.8
so yeah there you go immediately there

5695.76 --> 5705.1990000000005
is a balance

5700.8 --> 5705.1990000000005
squirt splaining no no that's

5707.84 --> 5713.679
because squirting is the esoteric is an

5712.159 --> 5717.839999999999
esoteric approach to

5713.679 --> 5720.96
what the action is so you can't

5717.84 --> 5724.159000000001
take the overarching concept and then

5720.96 --> 5724.8
put it into it that that's like i don't

5724.159 --> 5729.839999999999
know that's

5724.8 --> 5729.84
it doesn't work

5732.32 --> 5742.4
it's it's just squirting you could call

5734.719 --> 5745.44
it squirting

5742.4 --> 5757.839999999999
hat on a hat right i think i

5745.44 --> 5757.839999999999
you understand what i mean

5758.98 --> 5762.11
[Music]

5772.08 --> 5775.44
that's funny you know with the balls

5773.679 --> 5777.1990000000005
planing and flat splaining you could

5775.44 --> 5779.199
even make a list

5777.199 --> 5782.08
you could make a list about it of both

5779.199 --> 5783.28
like where do ballers typically refile

5782.08 --> 5785.44
it's going to be a big list

5783.28 --> 5788.5599999999995
and then where do flat earthers

5785.44 --> 5792.719
typically reify

5788.56 --> 5795.679
because they do a lot of them do

5792.719 --> 5796.08
and of course it's logically why because

5795.679 --> 5799.36
they

5796.08 --> 5802.719
want it all filled in so they

5799.36 --> 5804.639
with all the uncertainties they just

5802.719 --> 5806.88
don't like to handle it

5804.639 --> 5808.4800000000005
and then they just choose a very

5806.88 --> 5811.28
specific path

5808.48 --> 5814.32
that fits the model that they end up

5811.28 --> 5818.159
with the disc

5814.32 --> 5818.159
with the doom and all that

5821.92 --> 5826.32
but you could potentially make a list of

5823.679 --> 5828.4
that and just show it

5826.32 --> 5830.5599999999995
that might actually be yeah an

5828.4 --> 5834.48
interesting thing to do

5830.56 --> 5834.4800000000005
i would have to like make that list

5834.8 --> 5838.96
maybe i'll do that or maybe i'll just

5837.119 --> 5840.239
forget about this again and bring it up

5838.96 --> 5841.92
again later because it

5840.239 --> 5843.759999999999
it is a thing you know it's not even

5841.92 --> 5846.159
something oh i just came up with this no

5843.76 --> 5849.84
no that's been going on for a while

5846.159 --> 5850.159
it's just now i've got a designation for

5849.84 --> 5855.84
it

5850.159 --> 5855.839999999999
ball splaining flat splaining

5864.0 --> 5869.84
now you're ruining it

5876.719 --> 5880.08
although yeah the whole splaining has

5879.28 --> 5883.84
already been

5880.08 --> 5883.84
pretty much ruined

5886.159 --> 5889.36
i know maybe it's just stupid calling it

5888.08 --> 5892.4
that

5889.36 --> 5894.839999999999
but it is still an

5892.4 --> 5896.879999999999
interesting concept to put a list

5894.84 --> 5900.32
together

5896.88 --> 5900.88
of yeah reifications from that typically

5900.32 --> 5903.28
happen

5900.88 --> 5910.55
just you could make it just an

5903.28 --> 5913.92
interesting list

5910.55 --> 5918.2390000000005
[Music]

5913.92 --> 5918.2390000000005
then it would be very funny also to see

5918.56 --> 5925.280000000001
the list that ballers would make that

5922.0 --> 5927.76
they think flat earthers reify

5925.28 --> 5929.5199999999995
which is going to be something very

5927.76 --> 5930.639
silly

5929.52 --> 5932.639
like things that are more

5930.639 --> 5934.8
incontradictive with their convoluted

5932.639 --> 5937.6
machinations that they don't even

5934.8 --> 5938.0
potentially know our machinations so it

5937.6 --> 5941.76
would be

5938.0 --> 5943.44
funny to see that list from the ballers

5941.76 --> 5945.280000000001
perspective as well

5943.44 --> 5947.04
they would make a list like that because

5945.28 --> 5948.639
if i'm going to make that list and

5947.04 --> 5950.88
present it at some point you

5948.639 --> 5952.08
bet your ballers are going to make their

5950.88 --> 5967.84
own list they always

5952.08 --> 5967.84
do that [ __ ] they have to

5980.719 --> 5986.4
right so anyway new year's resolutions

5984.239 --> 5987.44
i got 15 more minutes but when it comes

5986.4 --> 5989.839999999999
to new year's

5987.44 --> 5992.96
resolutions i'm pretty much going to

5989.84 --> 5998.159000000001
continue what i've already

5992.96 --> 5998.159
set out to do that is

6003.199 --> 6010.32
yeah retain the level of energy

6007.28 --> 6013.759999999999
but attempting to not

6010.32 --> 6017.5199999999995
lose as much of it through

6013.76 --> 6020.4800000000005
polarized situations so becoming less

6017.52 --> 6020.4800000000005
angry i guess

6020.96 --> 6027.44
bending off the such situations quicker

6024.239 --> 6031.678999999999
to more constructive

6027.44 --> 6033.44
responses that's going to be a big focus

6031.679 --> 6035.36
it kind of already is but now i'm just

6033.44 --> 6037.759999999999
saying it like this is

6035.36 --> 6039.5199999999995
this is gonna happen with me as much as

6037.76 --> 6042.639
i can muster

6039.52 --> 6044.4800000000005
in 2021

6042.639 --> 6045.84
because i still have the passion i still

6044.48 --> 6049.919999999999
have the fury i'm still

6045.84 --> 6052.08
outraged about things a lot i still have

6049.92 --> 6053.28
moments where i do get the berserker's

6052.08 --> 6057.6
call again i just

6053.28 --> 6060.239
don't want to share it

6057.6 --> 6062.4800000000005
with the public and every time it does

6060.239 --> 6064.638999999999
happen it feels like i must

6062.48 --> 6065.839999999999
like it's very it's like an important

6064.639 --> 6069.92
thing that i

6065.84 --> 6071.92
just push hard for a moment

6069.92 --> 6073.84
and then drop doing that because i can't

6071.92 --> 6076.2390000000005
hold on to that sort of

6073.84 --> 6077.679
attitude it's really exhausting and it's

6076.239 --> 6080.959999999999
not constructive

6077.679 --> 6084.0
but sometimes i need to show it in its

6080.96 --> 6086.0
purest form to the outside world

6084.0 --> 6088.48
basically give off a signal like yeah

6086.0 --> 6090.8
yeah i'm i'm still kind of patient

6088.48 --> 6092.08
because i have to but there are things

6090.8 --> 6094.88
that just

6092.08 --> 6096.88
really frustrate me and then i try to

6094.88 --> 6100.56
summarize that in a high energy

6096.88 --> 6104.8
level and throw it out there

6100.56 --> 6104.8
like an energy bolt can be a mia

6105.199 --> 6111.759999999999
and then i stopped doing that because i

6108.08 --> 6111.76
can't keep up that energy level

6118.84 --> 6125.04
um

6121.36 --> 6126.239
but also yeah continuing with diffusing

6125.04 --> 6128.08
trolls

6126.239 --> 6130.0
i've already become pretty good at it i

6128.08 --> 6134.4
think i want to become

6130.0 --> 6138.719
even better at it

6134.4 --> 6138.719
and see how far i can take it

6140.159 --> 6145.839999999999
because i don't know how i could

6143.6 --> 6149.1990000000005
think it could go very it all depends on

6145.84 --> 6150.88
the individual of course

6149.199 --> 6152.638999999999
but i think there's a lot of trolls out

6150.88 --> 6153.52
there that are are kind of just

6152.639 --> 6155.52
desperate

6153.52 --> 6157.52
so they in a way they don't even want a

6155.52 --> 6160.320000000001
troll they just don't

6157.52 --> 6163.92
know how else to deal with what their

6160.32 --> 6166.719
what they have inside they have no grip

6163.92 --> 6167.84
so yeah they might not even consciously

6166.719 --> 6169.76
realize it but

6167.84 --> 6172.159000000001
when you're with me you're hanging

6169.76 --> 6175.360000000001
around with me you're watching my show

6172.159 --> 6177.04
i might just in the moment figure out

6175.36 --> 6179.119
exactly what your issue is

6177.04 --> 6180.88
and hand you the tools you've actually

6179.119 --> 6182.4
been desperately looking for

6180.88 --> 6184.2390000000005
and you don't even have to give

6182.4 --> 6186.0
recognition to that you could just

6184.239 --> 6186.718999999999
realize it in the moment and then

6186.0 --> 6189.679
certainly

6186.719 --> 6190.159
help transform yourself into a better

6189.679 --> 6204.2390000000005
person

6190.159 --> 6206.08
going on a better path just like that

6204.239 --> 6208.32
yeah ball splitting trying to explain

6206.08 --> 6209.44
reality by forcing it into a globe

6208.32 --> 6211.36
theory perspective

6209.44 --> 6213.599999999999
indeed that's yeah that's a pretty good

6211.36 --> 6213.599999999999
one

6214.0 --> 6220.0
that that's a good summary of

6217.6 --> 6222.88
what it is that they do with ball

6220.0 --> 6222.88
splitting indeed

6224.56 --> 6229.119000000001
although i would replace forcing by

6230.84 --> 6234.88
reifying

6233.199 --> 6237.44
and yeah let's change it around like

6234.88 --> 6246.68
they reify the globe theory perspective

6237.44 --> 6254.009999999999
into reality yeah

6246.68 --> 6254.01
[Music]

6255.44 --> 6260.159
right so who knows how far i can take

6258.84 --> 6262.08
this

6260.159 --> 6263.92
dealing with the trolls with in the way

6262.08 --> 6264.48
that i do and there might be trolls that

6263.92 --> 6267.52
are just

6264.48 --> 6268.32
inaccepting like they want to be troll

6267.52 --> 6273.1990000000005
against me

6268.32 --> 6275.119
even though i gave them tools

6273.199 --> 6276.638999999999
that they can use to better themselves

6275.119 --> 6278.159
and they might even do that but they

6276.639 --> 6280.4800000000005
still want to be trolls

6278.159 --> 6282.239
i don't know how far i can take all this

6280.48 --> 6284.879999999999
but i yeah

6282.239 --> 6286.32
it is also for myself a much more

6284.88 --> 6289.52
interesting perspective

6286.32 --> 6291.679
on everyone because everybody has

6289.52 --> 6293.4400000000005
issues with things and sometimes they

6291.679 --> 6295.04
don't know even why it just

6293.44 --> 6298.159
frustrates them and they try to deal

6295.04 --> 6298.159
with it and they try to

6298.56 --> 6302.400000000001
do something that to the ones that do

6301.28 --> 6304.8
understand it

6302.4 --> 6305.839999999999
just looks like foolish or trolling and

6304.8 --> 6307.92
it might be

6305.84 --> 6309.76
trolling in a way it's just from the

6307.92 --> 6310.719
other side then and it has a reason to

6309.76 --> 6314.639
be there

6310.719 --> 6317.119
so trolls are just

6314.639 --> 6319.04
or not always but sometimes trolls are

6317.119 --> 6324.08
just people

6319.04 --> 6324.08
looking for a solution they just

6324.4 --> 6328.0
end up doing it the exact opposite

6327.36 --> 6331.599999999999
anyway

6328.0 --> 6332.48
but by doing that sending out a

6331.6 --> 6335.679
challenge to

6332.48 --> 6339.199
others to basically point

6335.679 --> 6341.1990000000005
that out to them see it

6339.199 --> 6343.119
it may be trolling maybe just the

6341.199 --> 6345.919999999999
natural part of

6343.119 --> 6346.5599999999995
psychological chemistry manifesting

6345.92 --> 6349.92
within

6346.56 --> 6352.4800000000005
the social media internet world that the

6349.92 --> 6356.8
in social media internet world allows it

6352.48 --> 6358.879999999999
to to be that to be like that

6356.8 --> 6361.92
but it may be just a part of

6358.88 --> 6365.76
psychological processes of development

6361.92 --> 6365.76
a way to confront yourself

6367.36 --> 6370.08
indirectly

6370.4 --> 6374.32
or stay stuck in it forever it depends

6372.639 --> 6376.719
on how much of a

6374.32 --> 6377.44
opponent you're gonna seek out as a

6376.719 --> 6379.6
troll

6377.44 --> 6381.119
or if you're just gonna stay a coward

6379.6 --> 6384.159000000001
and just hang around

6381.119 --> 6385.199
trolling people that don't know how to

6384.159 --> 6387.679
deal with you

6385.199 --> 6389.759999999999
and that are just gonna get stupid about

6387.679 --> 6391.36
it and then just be oh he's stupid he oh

6389.76 --> 6392.719
you're gonna spend all your time like oh

6391.36 --> 6394.239
this person is stupid this person is

6392.719 --> 6396.4800000000005
stupid or are you gonna seek out an

6394.239 --> 6401.839999999999
actual challenge

6396.48 --> 6401.839999999999
you think you control me

6401.92 --> 6405.119
because when you take on an actual

6403.36 --> 6405.92
challenge you might actually learn

6405.119 --> 6411.599999999999
something

6405.92 --> 6415.04
how about that uh even valuable lessons

6411.6 --> 6417.360000000001
if you're just going after the weak yeah

6415.04 --> 6428.48
then that weakness is going to rub on

6417.36 --> 6431.92
off on you

6428.48 --> 6431.919999999999
[Music]

6440.84 --> 6443.84
hmm

6459.119 --> 6463.119
i think all the trolls are all asleep

6468.84 --> 6471.84
now

6477.119 --> 6488.159
i control if you want uh

6485.119 --> 6490.159
optional trolling what that's not really

6488.159 --> 6494.48
trolling that's just being

6490.159 --> 6497.28
an ass i don't need you to be an ass

6494.48 --> 6500.638999999999
like a real troll trolls because they

6497.28 --> 6503.5199999999995
have a need they have a drive

6500.639 --> 6504.639
usually something that they can't deal

6503.52 --> 6507.84
with normally

6504.639 --> 6510.159000000001
so then they go out and troll to

6507.84 --> 6511.28
potentially seek out somebody that's

6510.159 --> 6514.239
gonna confront them

6511.28 --> 6514.96
on a good level so that they may

6514.239 --> 6517.119
actually

6514.96 --> 6518.719
resolve the issue that's pushing them to

6517.119 --> 6520.88
troll in the first place now they don't

6518.719 --> 6524.84
know this consciously

6520.88 --> 6526.32
but it might be a part of the the social

6524.84 --> 6529.360000000001
mechanism

6526.32 --> 6541.04
why it's happening part of the design

6529.36 --> 6543.679
you could say

6541.04 --> 6544.719
no here we go again that's a gross over

6543.679 --> 6546.8
generalization

6544.719 --> 6549.84
look there are cowardly trolls but there

6546.8 --> 6549.84
are also just

6550.88 --> 6555.84
trolls that aren't cowardly not all

6553.119 --> 6555.839999999999
trolls are cowards

6556.639 --> 6562.08
but also trolling is also about getting

6559.28 --> 6562.08
on your nerves

6564.4 --> 6568.0
you know it's basically to try to force

6567.28 --> 6570.8
somebody to

6568.0 --> 6571.76
let down their guard or their image that

6570.8 --> 6574.639
they're weaving

6571.76 --> 6574.639
if they do that

6580.639 --> 6586.56
and hey some people are also trolls in

6583.28 --> 6589.36
face-to-face situations

6586.56 --> 6590.4800000000005
although they yeah how bad some trolls

6589.36 --> 6593.28
get

6590.48 --> 6595.119
those people the really disgusting ones

6593.28 --> 6595.759999999999
they never get like that face to face

6595.119 --> 6598.639
because

6595.76 --> 6599.360000000001
those are like the nasty bottom of the

6598.639 --> 6601.84
barrel

6599.36 --> 6601.839999999999
trolls

6603.36 --> 6612.5
they just want to piss off people

6611.119 --> 6615.688999999999
right

6612.5 --> 6615.689
[Music]

6617.28 --> 6621.04
yeah the vampiric trolls those are like

6619.679 --> 6624.0
really

6621.04 --> 6625.04
bottom of the barrel they have a void

6624.0 --> 6627.599
and they seek to

6625.04 --> 6627.599
fill it up

6631.36 --> 6634.88
yeah but those types of trolls are not

6632.96 --> 6636.639
really that interesting they just

6634.88 --> 6639.84
and but yeah they just get banned

6636.639 --> 6639.84
usually anyway

6641.119 --> 6647.598999999999
so they try to find somebody that

6644.4 --> 6649.199
doesn't recognize them for what they

6647.599 --> 6651.119000000001
truly are

6649.199 --> 6653.28
rapidly or that would just leave them

6651.119 --> 6655.119
there or

6653.28 --> 6656.96
or they just start making sock accounts

6655.119 --> 6660.0
and try it over and over and over again

6656.96 --> 6660.0
that's what trolls do

6663.76 --> 6667.84
it's part of the discipline

6668.88 --> 6681.84
it's really funny calling it a

6670.4 --> 6681.839999999999
discipline but i just did

6682.33 --> 6688.159
[Music]

6684.96 --> 6694.61
anyway anything else before i'm gonna

6688.159 --> 6697.598999999999
round out the show

6694.61 --> 6702.4
[Music]

6697.599 --> 6705.28
the first show of 2021

6702.4 --> 6706.32
it's gonna take some some getting used

6705.28 --> 6711.199
to to

6706.32 --> 6723.199
not have that symmetry of 2020 anymore

6711.199 --> 6725.28
just a number of symmetry

6723.199 --> 6726.32
am i doing anything special today well

6725.28 --> 6730.08
no not really

6726.32 --> 6736.0
everything is closed everything

6730.08 --> 6738.719
and i'm just gonna hang around

6736.0 --> 6741.679
don't know having a calm day i i pretty

6738.719 --> 6743.44
stocked up on everything and

6741.679 --> 6745.119
wasn't planning anything special but i

6743.44 --> 6745.839999999999
am going to join the flat earth debates

6745.119 --> 6751.839999999999
right

6745.84 --> 6751.84
after this

6757.28 --> 6761.44
dc electric says you can't have the

6760.48 --> 6779.839999999999
positive

6761.44 --> 6779.839999999999
with no negative connection what

6781.84 --> 6785.28
oh okay that sounds nice here we go

6783.599 --> 6788.56
again

6785.28 --> 6791.44
well i don't i don't have yeah

6788.56 --> 6793.119000000001
a lot of local people that i really know

6791.44 --> 6797.759999999999
well enough

6793.119 --> 6800.239
to visit them over here

6797.76 --> 6800.96
and i i kind of feel like just taking it

6800.239 --> 6804.839999999999
easy

6800.96 --> 6807.84
anyway i'm such a

6804.84 --> 6807.84
recluse

6808.639 --> 6823.84
i hope i'm using the right word for that

6820.96 --> 6825.119
yeah yeah that's exactly the right word

6823.84 --> 6826.96
it is

6825.119 --> 6828.48
sometimes i have like i'm using words

6826.96 --> 6830.32
and then i'm wondering like does this

6828.48 --> 6831.598999999999
mean what i think it means

6830.32 --> 6834.08
and then it turns out yeah it means

6831.599 --> 6837.84
exactly what i thought it means

6834.08 --> 6840.32
it's weird that i sometimes

6837.84 --> 6841.52
use words and i don't really know how i

6840.32 --> 6844.88
know that word

6841.52 --> 6846.96
what i do and in the same manner

6844.88 --> 6849.76
sometimes just

6846.96 --> 6851.76
really detailed words just come falling

6849.76 --> 6852.8
out of nowhere that i barely use but i

6851.76 --> 6854.56
then just use it

6852.8 --> 6856.8
right at the right time and i don't even

6854.56 --> 6859.280000000001
understand where it came from

6856.8 --> 6860.96
it's very weird to me when it happens

6859.28 --> 6862.719
but it is interesting because it also

6860.96 --> 6865.84
helps just my

6862.719 --> 6865.84
lingual development

6870.4 --> 6874.5599999999995
although i do still make mistakes

6872.0 --> 6877.92
verbally

6874.56 --> 6881.4400000000005
i guess that i'm still somewhat

6877.92 --> 6883.84
creative but i try to get it all right

6881.44 --> 6886.879999999999
it's it's just building it's growing i'm

6883.84 --> 6886.88
trying to make it better

6887.599 --> 6892.400000000001
