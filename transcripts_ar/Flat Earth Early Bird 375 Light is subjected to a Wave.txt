[Music]

31.56 --> 33.619
you

42.11 --> 44.17
you

46.39 --> 48.42
ooh

48.7 --> 53.830000000000005
morning welcome to Flat Earth early-bird

50.98 --> 55.75
number 375 I'm your host

53.83 --> 57.37
Arwen before we start to show please

55.75 --> 59.26
don't forget to share it on any platform

57.37 --> 60.94
you deem fit and if you haven't already

59.26 --> 62.559999999999995
subscribed to my channel and hit the

60.94 --> 64.53999999999999
bell notification so you know when I'm

62.56 --> 67.36
going live just normally 2:00 p.m.

64.54 --> 69.43
Amsterdam time every day and please also

67.36 --> 72.07
do support me and my channel through the

69.43 --> 73.30000000000001
super chat paypal patreon and my

72.07 --> 79.41999999999999
GoFundMe that would be much appreciated

73.3 --> 83.83
so today the weather well it's kind of

79.42 --> 87.72
nice oh yeah seem to be love at camp

83.83 --> 91.0
trailing out alone you can clearly see

87.72 --> 96.43
what yeah started out as a once again a

91.0 --> 102.03999999999999
splendid sunny morning very cold though

96.43 --> 105.31
and yeah I talked to my friend Rotterdam

102.04 --> 110.259
and I am going out and I'm pretty much

105.31 --> 115.569
going right after the show because yeah

110.259 --> 117.25
it's it's pretty long anyway yeah from

115.569 --> 122.319
the afternoon till the late in the

117.25 --> 124.6
evening and yeah kind of excited about

122.319 --> 126.789
going there it's been like the last time

124.6 --> 134.26
I've even been there was when I met my

126.789 --> 137.95
ex it's a long time ago I hope I enjoy

134.26 --> 141.51999999999998
myself to a GM don't know if I will

137.95 --> 144.459
though it's just a lot of mixed feelings

141.52 --> 146.94
go but yeah it will be good to see my

144.459 --> 146.94
friend again

149.6 --> 158.94
yeah let's see who is in chat for that

153.48 --> 167.60999999999999
oh yeah I have mint tea that's it to our

158.94 --> 171.32999999999998
coffee two hours ago so we have ruined

167.61 --> 173.79000000000002
Thorson was first didn't watch his video

171.33 --> 179.52
yet though and get to it

173.79 --> 185.76
AGM they lie Ohio Missouri bear George

179.52 --> 188.97
Sanford Robin Stanley John Watson a man

185.76 --> 201.45
a young the Steve Flint gravels porn

188.97 --> 202.46
okay ESP power 117 doc Michael yeah good

201.45 --> 207.11999999999998
to see you all

202.46 --> 218.39000000000001
so yeah yesterday's robust this was very

207.12 --> 221.34
interesting but yeah this court I just I

218.39 --> 223.67999999999998
just OH

221.34 --> 226.92000000000002
basically this Court struck yesterday

223.68 --> 231.69
evening and like right in the heat of

226.92 --> 234.32999999999998
the argument with Nathan at some point

231.69 --> 236.79
well this court muted me and I didn't

234.33 --> 238.74
see it so I was trying to give my

236.79 --> 242.959
counter arguments nobody heard me and

238.74 --> 245.10000000000002
like moved on that was like really

242.959 --> 247.23
aggravating as hell and I thought that

245.1 --> 249.26
kind of somebody muted me Impreza that

247.23 --> 252.75
Nathan muted me on purpose like it was

249.26 --> 255.09
Flat Earth debates but it didn't seem to

252.75 --> 259.169
be the case it and it's just discord

255.09 --> 261.03000000000003
screwing and that's I don't like it this

259.169 --> 263.64
good there's some there's weird stuff

261.03 --> 265.32
going on with the discord like there's

263.64 --> 269.39
gremlins roaming around and they're

265.32 --> 269.39
screwing with people on purpose

270.12 --> 279.93
I don't trust it yeah but yeah despite

276.96 --> 282.33
that the show was pretty good make West

279.93 --> 290.37
he did his best but he didn't pass the

282.33 --> 295.40999999999997
test all right yeah I agree

290.37 --> 298.53000000000003
Riley also gets a lot of flack but he

295.41 --> 304.05
does get very apologetic though and that

298.53 --> 306.38899999999995
is annoying so he deserves a little flak

304.05 --> 308.19
but sometimes yeah I guess we yeah

306.389 --> 312.93
especially from the ballers he just gets

308.19 --> 315.0
insane amounts of flack and that it's

312.93 --> 317.58
probably because he's just very capable

315.0 --> 319.94
and what he does so he's a threat to

317.58 --> 319.94
them

326.46 --> 330.84
yeah um put the pasta yeah thought the

329.07 --> 332.87
past is behind me I don't have to put it

330.84 --> 332.86999999999995
there

350.62 --> 353.13
is

353.69 --> 364.889
yeah thanks for that I guess that

361.02 --> 367.47999999999996
happened there as well I I'm just not

364.889 --> 374.75
going to be roaming around there at all

367.48 --> 377.34000000000003
[Music]

374.75 --> 382.32
the only way I'll ever use it will be

377.34 --> 384.86999999999995
unsecured servers like to be I guess on

382.32 --> 387.479
a panel and shows that that's that's the

384.87 --> 389.14
only way I'll ever use it I'm not gonna

387.479 --> 392.25
roam around there

389.14 --> 392.25
[Music]

409.51 --> 412.87
anyway yeah

413.39 --> 420.71
the argument yesterday that yeah it got

417.26 --> 425.15
me thinking a lot about light is in the

420.71 --> 427.94
wave and just a comparison with with

425.15 --> 433.07
things that are subjected to waves it's

427.94 --> 436.46
like always a medium transfer effect

433.07 --> 441.34999999999997
just like sound is not a thing it is

436.46 --> 444.56
actually a yeah a wave effect that is

441.35 --> 447.95000000000005
applied to the matter and that causes

444.56 --> 451.94
well yeah that the the transfer as it

447.95 --> 455.75
were which we perceive as sound and so

451.94 --> 459.38
does water waves like in the ocean yeah

455.75 --> 463.64
it's being subjected to a displacement

459.38 --> 467.69
and that causes waves so I think that

463.64 --> 472.21999999999997
light generally is not subjected to that

467.69 --> 474.38
but very similar to setups like for

472.22 --> 476.54
example wind tunnel for aerodynamics

474.38 --> 480.38
testing if there are certain obstacles

476.54 --> 484.70000000000005
in locations it will absolutely cause

480.38 --> 486.5
the deviation of the molecules now this

484.7 --> 490.07
is also because of high pressure low

486.5 --> 495.02
pressure of effects of course that's the

490.07 --> 496.84999999999997
motion directly the direct effect that

495.02 --> 498.68
causes those displacements and that's

496.85 --> 505.13
not the case with light as far as I know

498.68 --> 508.61
but close proximity movement to to

505.13 --> 511.90999999999997
matter does have an influence on it and

508.61 --> 517.1800000000001
yeah one could consider that as a wave

511.91 --> 521.72
effect like as if the light was water

517.18 --> 525.3199999999999
but in constant motion so it's moving in

521.72 --> 529.19
a direction and like a rock was dropped

525.32 --> 530.99
in the water causing a ripple within the

529.19 --> 534.1700000000001
light but it's not a rock dropping no

530.99 --> 539.29
it's just the close proximity motion

534.17 --> 539.29
passed non transparent matter

541.41 --> 550.42
also just generally thinking about yet

548.29 --> 555.819
the wave pattern right that comes from

550.42 --> 563.8
double-slit light what is that why does

555.819 --> 566.199
it do that and yeah there's just ideas

563.8 --> 568.74
that I have about I wish I could have

566.199 --> 572.62
like a small set of where I can test it

568.74 --> 574.9590000000001
because really what I remember what it

572.62 --> 577.569
looked like it does make a lot of sense

574.959 --> 582.279
to me even though the pattern is

577.569 --> 587.519
somewhat surreal but it's just the

582.279 --> 587.519
fraction at Cascade and that ends up in

588.48 --> 595.269
well in the direction deviations it just

593.68 --> 597.819
seems like a wave I don't know yeah I

595.269 --> 600.49
guess it is a wave pattern it's not

597.819 --> 602.92
exactly a way it doesn't correlate to a

600.49 --> 607.87
wave it just is very seemingly like a

602.92 --> 610.149
wave but it would be in not in the

607.87 --> 613.18
typical material medium it would be the

610.149 --> 622.079
light medium so a ripple in the medium

613.18 --> 622.079
through which light goes so maybe

622.35 --> 628.83
a ripple in the ether funnily enough

625.16 --> 631.11
that is part of my intro a sentence in

628.83 --> 640.0200000000001
the intro ripple in the ether it's funny

631.11 --> 643.08
how that works but yeah I think it is

640.02 --> 645.87
safe to say that light is not a wave and

643.08 --> 647.51
yeah it may be considered as a particle

645.87 --> 649.47
where that is absolutely true

647.51 --> 652.17
considering particles should have

649.47 --> 656.1600000000001
indivisible natures and I don't think

652.17 --> 661.8199999999999
light has that it's been roughly deduced

656.16 --> 665.49
and then just set just like the supposed

661.82 --> 669.87
size of Venus being as big as the

665.49 --> 672.1800000000001
presume book ball earth just being set I

669.87 --> 674.51
think it was just set like yeah this is

672.18 --> 679.7399999999999
the light minimum based on some kind of

674.51 --> 682.53
test and that should have been a

679.74 --> 685.11
continuation in the investigation and I

682.53 --> 686.73
can think of how but they didn't they

685.11 --> 689.19
just said it and then they presumed the

686.73 --> 691.29
particle and then the whole mathematics

689.19 --> 693.0600000000001
nonsense came rolling out of it

691.29 --> 696.27
presuming that it's splitting up

693.06 --> 699.1199999999999
particle and all that craziness so and

696.27 --> 703.1
those things don't make any sense if you

699.12 --> 707.7
presume it is a indivisible natured

703.1 --> 711.45
particle but it is not a wave because

707.7 --> 713.94
waves are not things objects matter

711.45 --> 717.11
things are not waves things are

713.94 --> 717.11
subjected to waves

719.24 --> 729.22
a wave is a is a secondary effect that

725.329 --> 733.579
caused us like a displacement somehow a

729.22 --> 738.11
redistribution a turbulence effect

733.579 --> 741.519
displacement Y's and patterns in the

738.11 --> 744.9490000000001
substance that it is subjected to and

741.519 --> 746.86
well I I like to draw the comparison

744.949 --> 749.66
with light and just say like yeah the

746.86 --> 754.249
wave pattern that comes from the double

749.66 --> 756.11
slit is very is seems like a secondary

754.249 --> 759.9200000000001
effect in this case these slits the

756.11 --> 769.79
close proximity that changes the paths

759.92 --> 772.8689999999999
just as Stillwater's relation to one

769.79 --> 775.519
another would be changed if suddenly a

772.869 --> 778.8190000000001
rock would be dropped in it and there

775.519 --> 780.499
would be ripples now there's other

778.819 --> 782.4799999999999
things that play mainly that yeah

780.499 --> 784.519
eventually it will go still again it is

782.48 --> 787.549
more subjected to the passage of time

784.519 --> 792.049
and light just seems to be nearly

787.549 --> 795.019
instant there's no yeah it won't die

792.049 --> 797.059
down it's just going it's just it keeps

795.019 --> 800.269
on going if it keeps on going past that

797.059 --> 803.809
slit then it will just keep on waving so

800.269 --> 807.74
anyway it's my little bit about that

803.809 --> 810.139
it's still kind of conceptual that's why

807.74 --> 815.74
I'm not claiming any big things about it

810.139 --> 815.74
but I think it is important to to note

821.78 --> 825.159
[Music]

831.56 --> 838.7299999999999
all right but yeah is p-power feeling

836.24 --> 842.66
the sound you can feel the displacement

838.73 --> 845.48
of the air in a certain pattern and your

842.66 --> 847.999
senses can recognize that pattern and

845.48 --> 850.519
that is how you recognize sound right

847.999 --> 852.3190000000001
very vibration but the actual hearing of

850.519 --> 856.089
sound is kind of weird how that works

852.319 --> 860.4799999999999
because it is a deduction process

856.089 --> 862.129
there's a sensitive part that is being

860.48 --> 865.269
subjected to these waves and then

862.129 --> 865.269
translating that

873.11 --> 877.67
it's very interesting how that works

875.4 --> 877.67
actually

882.68 --> 893.06
sometimes I wonder if sound in a way is

887.01 --> 895.529
just like color like people could be

893.06 --> 897.5999999999999
perceiving sounds just completely

895.529 --> 902.279
different but they would be standard

897.6 --> 903.779
attuned to that way sound works and form

902.279 --> 908.22
their own opinions or at their own

903.779 --> 908.9399999999999
reactions to it but how can you tell the

908.22 --> 912.4490000000001
difference

908.94 --> 918.8100000000001
besides I don't like it or I like it or

912.449 --> 921.8389999999999
try to describe it I just wonder

918.81 --> 925.88
sometimes does everybody experience

921.839 --> 925.8800000000001
hearing exactly the same

933.75 --> 940.6
yeah I know Matlin guard it can be some

937.0 --> 944.44
objectively measured but it it's

940.6 --> 945.0400000000001
basically the same system and yeah it

944.44 --> 947.4100000000001
will be

945.04 --> 952.0899999999999
for example digitized or recorded

947.41 --> 954.76
somehow and then retranslated making the

952.09 --> 958.0
exact wages were recorded again but

954.76 --> 960.85
again how somebody takes that to their

958.0 --> 967.57
consciousness is another matter how they

960.85 --> 969.34
actually hear it I don't know if you

967.57 --> 972.57
guys understand what I'm trying to

969.34 --> 972.57
communicate here

983.58 --> 986.36
hmm

990.8 --> 1000.25
okay doc Michael that I never heard of

995.3 --> 1003.64
that yes interesting comparison yeah I

1000.25 --> 1006.42
don't know if that's you actually

1003.64 --> 1006.42
confirmed that

1033.72 --> 1036.3500000000001
right

1052.28 --> 1057.19
that's interesting dog Michael I

1054.26 --> 1057.19
wouldn't be surprised

1084.1 --> 1087.6299999999999
man it's cold

1107.25 --> 1116.75
all right they lie Ohio yeah it's like

1112.5 --> 1116.75
sonar communication

1119.14 --> 1124.5700000000002
well there are even weirder things like

1121.87 --> 1128.399
sharks can also smell blood I think

1124.57 --> 1132.37
thousands of miles away nearly instantly

1128.399 --> 1135.9089999999999
dispite yeah how is that how is that

1132.37 --> 1139.7199999999998
spreading around so fast that is very

1135.909 --> 1141.8990000000001
mysterious so mate yeah does it actually

1139.72 --> 1145.929
smell it or does it almost feel the

1141.899 --> 1149.289
frequency of it at a distance I wonder

1145.929 --> 1155.44
sometimes because actual smelling means

1149.289 --> 1158.889
that it has to travel towards and if

1155.44 --> 1162.159
shark could smell blood like a thousand

1158.889 --> 1165.34
miles away instantly to instantly go

1162.159 --> 1167.2
traveling there how could that substance

1165.34 --> 1169.87
have found its way all the way to the

1167.2 --> 1173.679
shark at that pace in water like in air

1169.87 --> 1174.61
mmm you know debatable air travels a lot

1173.679 --> 1179.409
in water

1174.61 --> 1181.6299999999999
really okay hundreds of miles away maybe

1179.409 --> 1186.0700000000002
that's still insane distances and still

1181.63 --> 1189.1490000000001
water and usually cold water it doesn't

1186.07 --> 1189.149
spread around that fast

1203.27 --> 1214.25
well nature documentaries and then yeah

1206.84 --> 1217.6299999999999
we Devon with demonstrations it's like

1214.25 --> 1219.74
the Sharks always show up a lot of them

1217.63 --> 1222.91
even though there were no we're even

1219.74 --> 1222.91
there inside

1227.02 --> 1233.15
hey and sharks are known to be so Nurik

1230.929 --> 1235.76
spurts right they have this whole thing

1233.15 --> 1239.0300000000002
on their face these senses so in their

1235.76 --> 1241.16
senses so maybe it is not literally

1239.03 --> 1244.7
using the smell maybe it is using some

1241.16 --> 1246.679
kind of mysterious super sonar thing

1244.7 --> 1250.04
where it can literally detect a certain

1246.679 --> 1253.8500000000001
frequency maybe it was a tune to do that

1250.04 --> 1257.6599999999999
very specifically even so it could just

1253.85 --> 1261.9399999999998
detect the frequency of opened of open

1257.66 --> 1261.94
blood in water who knows

1265.79 --> 1272.97
dolphins and whales sharks don't really

1268.91 --> 1275.66
they do they have this view this no I'm

1272.97 --> 1275.66
pretty sure they do

1275.84 --> 1286.6799999999998
now but that is how they know it now no

1283.41 --> 1289.47
but look the with whales and dolphins

1286.68 --> 1294.8700000000001
its communication so it is a sound they

1289.47 --> 1297.56
create that that is that but with sharks

1294.87 --> 1301.9799999999998
I don't think it's even really been

1297.56 --> 1306.09
properly tested probably so they're just

1301.98 --> 1311.72
assuming it's smelling it but what if it

1306.09 --> 1315.57
is not literally the smell but sonar

1311.72 --> 1317.52
related detection maybe that thing that

1315.57 --> 1320.1599999999999
they can use for close proximity

1317.52 --> 1322.85
detection they can also use for super

1320.16 --> 1322.8500000000001
long distance

1327.74 --> 1333.409
while sorry if I'm not using the right

1330.89 --> 1336.159
terminology for the effect of how they

1333.409 --> 1343.0700000000002
would be doing it I'm kind of

1336.159 --> 1347.5390000000002
improvising here it just doesn't make a

1343.07 --> 1350.1789999999999
lot of sense to me that the actual smell

1347.539 --> 1353.33
of blood could travel at vast distances

1350.179 --> 1357.0700000000002
in water seemingly instantly for a shark

1353.33 --> 1357.07
to detect it and go all that way

1368.37 --> 1371.33
what the hell

1374.59 --> 1382.9599999999998
well if you say I don't understand it

1378.72 --> 1385.179
why don't you enlighten me I'm gonna

1382.96 --> 1387.1000000000001
talk about whatever I come up with and

1385.179 --> 1390.3300000000002
whatever I want and I'm trying to gonna

1387.1 --> 1393.33
I'm gonna try to be as correct as I can

1390.33 --> 1393.33
okay

1394.409 --> 1402.8500000000001
so if you have some specific data that

1398.879 --> 1405.399
completely negates my conceptual

1402.85 --> 1408.759
assertions here then I'd love to hear

1405.399 --> 1413.85
that please enlighten me I'm open for

1408.759 --> 1413.85
learning I'm just speculating here

1417.09 --> 1423.809
all right flatland that's my natural

1419.799 --> 1423.809
assumption - sounds a lot faster than

1423.96 --> 1431.279
then smell and taste which requires

1427.809 --> 1431.279
molecular presence

1437.13 --> 1439.8500000000001
yes

1453.09 --> 1459.809
no but Matt lingard it doesn't really

1455.669 --> 1464.7
matter the source when you actually get

1459.809 --> 1467.34
to see footage and if it seems to be a

1464.7 --> 1469.73
repeatable thing like it becomes

1467.34 --> 1474.809
generally known like more some kind of

1469.73 --> 1478.35
havoc bleeding stuff like for example

1474.809 --> 1482.1589999999999
even if or cast would start to attack

1478.35 --> 1485.07
seals I think that eventually while

1482.159 --> 1487.8890000000001
depends orcas are kind of dangerous even

1485.07 --> 1490.59
to sharks but if any kind of thing like

1487.889 --> 1498.08
that had like all sharks usually tend to

1490.59 --> 1498.08
show up very quickly if if they can

1498.32 --> 1510.6
anyway and I'm not but what does it

1507.869 --> 1512.97
matter really what the beliefs of the

1510.6 --> 1514.619
people are that share that information

1512.97 --> 1516.95
it doesn't really have anything to do

1514.619 --> 1516.9499999999998
with that

1525.34 --> 1530.6789999999999
well the they lie Ohio the the whole

1528.07 --> 1535.21
water distress thing that is much more

1530.679 --> 1543.1000000000001
for when sharks are around like pretty

1535.21 --> 1545.08
close by and within a mile or less if

1543.1 --> 1548.289
something is just splashing around

1545.08 --> 1552.899
they're not gonna come from ten or a

1548.289 --> 1552.899
hundred miles away because of the sound

1553.769 --> 1559.84
as far as I heard

1556.029 --> 1562.509
but hey again hey if you have some data

1559.84 --> 1565.889
that contradicts my assertion here then

1562.509 --> 1565.8890000000001
please enlighten me

1588.85 --> 1593.34
know how that happens yeah that's fast

1594.99 --> 1601.95
but still you have to recognize that

1597.919 --> 1604.14
unless the sound is very specific like

1601.95 --> 1606.57
what whales and dolphins do it is very

1604.14 --> 1610.679
specific very loud sound that apparently

1606.57 --> 1614.49
travels very far but general sound

1610.679 --> 1617.76
splashing sounds and all that those

1614.49 --> 1620.3990000000001
things do get absorbed by the body of

1617.76 --> 1622.919
water as well so to claim that those who

1620.399 --> 1624.7399999999998
would naturally have vast distances that

1622.919 --> 1627.75
doesn't seem to make a lot of sense

1624.74 --> 1630.26
requires her specific sounds to carry

1627.75 --> 1630.26
that far

1635.909 --> 1661.8590000000002
huh yeah thanks des Studio 68 yeah the

1642.809 --> 1666.69
intro is very cool right have I had

1661.859 --> 1680.879
breakfast yet well no not really but I

1666.69 --> 1689.429
got yeah a good lunch packed nice big

1680.879 --> 1693.859
bread see it's stuffed with fresh

1689.429 --> 1699.419
avocado and sun-dried tomatoes in oil

1693.859 --> 1702.569
mayonnaise lettuce and pine seeds so

1699.419 --> 1706.94
that should be a very good meal I could

1702.569 --> 1706.94
I really am looking forward

1708.78 --> 1715.53
I yeah and I to be fair i also for some

1712.35 --> 1717.6299999999999
reason have been avoiding eating healthy

1715.53 --> 1720.1499999999999
in the last week it's very annoying it's

1717.63 --> 1723.24
just like every time i just don't want

1720.15 --> 1726.3600000000001
to make good dinner it's really annoying

1723.24 --> 1728.8700000000001
all the heavens so I'm gonna need that

1726.36 --> 1728.87
bread

1734.11 --> 1741.85
yeah been eating way too much fried

1737.26 --> 1744.1
potatoes and and bitterballen and crook

1741.85 --> 1746.6999999999998
it's and all that even though it is

1744.1 --> 1746.6999999999998
organic and

1758.84 --> 1761.769
hmm

1763.49 --> 1772.82
smooth out all most fascinating

1765.74 --> 1782.24
flatlander I I don't know yeah look oil

1772.82 --> 1785.59
and water don't mix oh I don't know why

1782.24 --> 1785.59
it would spread out so quickly

1796.55 --> 1806.48
low frequency sound travel fastest yeah

1799.82 --> 1808.85
makes sense Alan Evans and it is kind of

1806.48 --> 1812.03
interesting even because if you listen

1808.85 --> 1818.27
to the sounds of whales it is like all

1812.03 --> 1823.6399999999999
the way over the Spectras like so they

1818.27 --> 1825.74
have so that makes sense that they use

1823.64 --> 1829.5500000000002
the more short waves to communicate

1825.74 --> 1832.64
directly to their surroundings and the

1829.55 --> 1835.22
really low ones are the pulses for the

1832.64 --> 1850.21
long distance communication that makes

1835.22 --> 1855.2
sense yeah look at I I am kind of like a

1850.21 --> 1857.1100000000001
vocal parrot I can make things so and my

1855.2 --> 1860.6000000000001
hearing is very exact

1857.11 --> 1862.74
it's like copy-paste to me I don't need

1860.6 --> 1865.0
a computer for that

1862.74 --> 1869.83
[Music]

1865.0 --> 1873.29
well one gets a wrench by not asking it

1869.83 --> 1875.6499999999999
as directed in the description box of

1873.29 --> 1875.6499999999999
YouTube

1878.25 --> 1881.38
[Music]

1884.15 --> 1888.0800000000002
yeah mr. crows around

1894.95 --> 1898.009
[Music]

1912.35 --> 1925.039
it is kind of funny you know I was

1915.679 --> 1929.029
thinking or funny now maybe not but yeah

1925.039 --> 1930.95
technically you could call whales maybe

1929.029 --> 1934.12
I could even do it I wonder like if I

1930.95 --> 1936.919
could probably don't have the the the

1934.12 --> 1939.3799999999999
proper sound power to emulate that

1936.919 --> 1941.24
enough for whales to respond but if I

1939.38 --> 1944.3890000000001
could like emulate that like in the

1941.24 --> 1948.3990000000001
ocean properly there's a lot of power

1944.389 --> 1948.399
behind it maybe they would actually come

1948.549 --> 1963.679
lad that's eager to try that out anytime

1952.009 --> 1965.45
soon who knows maybe like if I yeah

1963.679 --> 1967.3400000000001
there were whales in nearby

1965.45 --> 1968.96
I couldn't kind of attempt to call them

1967.34 --> 1974.0
almost like I would call the birds

1968.96 --> 1976.039
trying to emulate them yeah but I could

1974.0 --> 1978.139
definitely not make the sound properly

1976.039 --> 1982.58
enough for it to travel a thousand miles

1978.139 --> 1987.399
pretty sure that I can't do that don't

1982.58 --> 1987.399
have the lung capacity

1991.1 --> 1995.4089999999999
and the vocal cords anyway

2002.15 --> 2005.229
[Music]

2012.61 --> 2015.4189999999999
hmm

2015.47 --> 2026.179
oil on worry but yeah but flatlander

2018.62 --> 2026.83
it's oil on water right are you saying

2026.179 --> 2029.8700000000001
that

2026.83 --> 2032.6
yeah like blood yeah I guess blood would

2029.87 --> 2035.87
kind of float first at least especially

2032.6 --> 2037.6689999999999
if it was fatty and then you're saying

2035.87 --> 2042.9189999999999
that it would start to spread around

2037.669 --> 2046.669
just like the olive oil okay that at

2042.919 --> 2052.48
least is testable it would make a little

2046.669 --> 2052.48
more sense if that is actually the case

2058.32 --> 2066.09
it would be interesting to actually test

2060.81 --> 2068.31
that like instead of using the olive oil

2066.09 --> 2070.139
maybe it will be good even to have

2068.31 --> 2073.62
sensor so you can make like molecular

2070.139 --> 2076.61
sensors and add it at vast distances in

2073.62 --> 2079.3199999999997
the water and then yeah I guess like

2076.61 --> 2082.32
drop a bucket of pig's blood or

2079.32 --> 2084.69
something and see how quickly those

2082.32 --> 2089.55
sensors will pick up the Molech the

2084.69 --> 2092.85
molecular structure of the blood but I

2089.55 --> 2096.78
don't know I guess it's it is at least a

2092.85 --> 2099.33
testable concept so yeah thank you thank

2096.78 --> 2102.53
you for the suggestion in rectify

2099.33 --> 2102.5299999999997
understand now what you mean

2109.95 --> 2113.8089999999997
right now what would you want to know

2111.78 --> 2113.809
that

2118.04 --> 2123.609
yeah Major Tom I know I just said that

2120.8 --> 2123.6090000000004
ten minutes ago

2139.84 --> 2147.8
robbing Stanley almost intuitive I'd say

2143.0 --> 2152.21
they were almost pure intuition I've

2147.8 --> 2155.78
seen sharks well not well yeah like on

2152.21 --> 2158.359
the other side of the glass not in the

2155.78 --> 2159.9500000000003
water and also plenty of footage and it

2158.359 --> 2162.38
seems like they're in the permanent

2159.95 --> 2166.39
trance like I don't know they just

2162.38 --> 2168.7400000000002
they're like they look like that

2166.39 --> 2171.68
they're in a permanent trance and they

2168.74 --> 2174.83
just totally respond by instinct like

2171.68 --> 2185.72
they're not even fully conscious it

2174.83 --> 2190.5499999999997
seems to me I don't know okay that's all

2185.72 --> 2192.89
right RBG SAR fix what it is in the in

2190.55 --> 2194.3
the rules in the live chat rule so read

2192.89 --> 2199.4
the description box

2194.3 --> 2203.75
I usually don't hand out wrenches

2199.4 --> 2211.55
especially to newcomers I rarely even

2203.75 --> 2213.88
hang out wrenches to my regulars that's

2211.55 --> 2213.88
alright

2242.349 --> 2250.7490000000003
okay that's weird Alan Evans I disagree

2247.18 --> 2255.94
I think that not all wavelengths travel

2250.749 --> 2264.009
at the same speed I think that all the

2255.94 --> 2266.949
wavelengths conjoined travel and slow

2264.009 --> 2269.709
down and speed up I don't really think

2266.949 --> 2271.569
that light especially if it's just a

2269.709 --> 2274.509
wide spectrum that it all travels the

2271.569 --> 2276.959
same speed exactly I don't really think

2274.509 --> 2276.959
so

2295.76 --> 2303.05
ha the studio 68 well that's incorrect

2300.369 --> 2306.59
it's funny I also learned that from a

2303.05 --> 2312.8590000000004
nature documentary so what happens when

2306.59 --> 2314.9300000000003
a whale dies and if it doesn't just get

2312.859 --> 2317.99
shredded apart well there's always going

2314.93 --> 2319.7599999999998
to be left over stuff and that's gonna

2317.99 --> 2323.7799999999997
flow to the bottom of the ocean now

2319.76 --> 2326.0600000000004
depending on where it is if it's kind of

2323.78 --> 2329.57
deep yeah eventually you go out of reach

2326.06 --> 2333.17
of a lot of creatures but then there's

2329.57 --> 2336.6800000000003
always things like ales so whatever is

2333.17 --> 2339.83
left over everything is eaten every

2336.68 --> 2341.8999999999996
every snippet maybe the skeleton and

2339.83 --> 2343.67
that will eventually start like other

2341.9 --> 2349.55
things will start to chew on that like

2343.67 --> 2354.92
microbes and things and so yeah but eels

2349.55 --> 2358.55
like if any it's quite common that a lot

2354.92 --> 2361.19
of whale whales especially in the north

2358.55 --> 2363.59
in cold regions if they die and sink

2361.19 --> 2369.2200000000003
down then eels just start tearing into

2363.59 --> 2369.2200000000003
them and they become ill hives so

2377.7 --> 2381.5589999999997
eels sorry not eels

2385.21 --> 2389.19
yeah eels are pretty creepy

2412.97 --> 2420.519
crabs are huge scavengers yeah I guess

2416.859 --> 2420.519
crabs are pretty weird

2429.729 --> 2438.319
yeah I did quite a lot of well basic

2435.259 --> 2440.39
scuba diving well it's not like with gas

2438.319 --> 2443.39
tank and it's just the snorkel yeah I

2440.39 --> 2447.049
guess you call it snorkeling and at the

2443.39 --> 2448.8489999999997
east coast of Spain and there's a lot of

2447.049 --> 2450.769
rocks over there and yeah it's full of

2448.849 --> 2455.4790000000003
stuff well at least it used to be

2450.769 --> 2459.729
probably still is it's very salty ocean

2455.479 --> 2462.4399999999996
there but there's lots of crabs and just

2459.729 --> 2464.779
it was always very interesting to see

2462.44 --> 2467.959
what was going on and a lot of different

2464.779 --> 2475.91
fishes like swarms of little needle

2467.959 --> 2478.0989999999997
fishes and octave octopi and yeah

2475.91 --> 2481.489
jellyfish also sometimes so it's it

2478.099 --> 2484.299
could be creepy like the ocean can be

2481.489 --> 2484.299
pretty freaky

2492.47 --> 2501.95
no it's it's in the northeast part

2499.42 --> 2508.16
there's a lot of surface there and yeah

2501.95 --> 2510.8599999999997
we used to go in a camping like a wild

2508.16 --> 2514.1299999999997
pine forest camping really nice to go

2510.86 --> 2520.1
there in a tent very very fresh fresh

2514.13 --> 2525.59
air good it's very close to a village

2520.1 --> 2527.6
called pulse pea ALS yeah I was very old

2525.59 --> 2531.02
fashioned we liked it I don't know it

2527.6 --> 2533.42
may have completely tourists a fight to

2531.02 --> 2534.8
a maximum that we barely can recognize

2533.42 --> 2539.08
it I don't know what has happened I

2534.8 --> 2542.15
haven't been there for at least whoosh

2539.08 --> 2543.62
for like 18 years or something so I

2542.15 --> 2546.11
don't know what's going on there but we

2543.62 --> 2548.2999999999997
used to go there and I did a lot of

2546.11 --> 2550.61
snorkelling and that was really

2548.3 --> 2552.9700000000003
interesting there's just so much

2550.61 --> 2552.9700000000003
creatures

2559.21 --> 2563.589
ooh underwater caves oh that is so

2563.14 --> 2566.5589999999997
awesome

2563.589 --> 2569.369
but I would never do that without a suit

2566.559 --> 2573.73
on yeah and when you're snorkeling

2569.369 --> 2576.369
it's just swimming pants maybe flippers

2573.73 --> 2578.7400000000002
and the thing you're not protected at

2576.369 --> 2581.4100000000003
all so yeah there was very easy to get

2578.74 --> 2583.5099999999998
hurt it's kind of dangerous but if you

2581.41 --> 2586.45
have a proper suit on then it's not so

2583.51 --> 2589.8900000000003
not so scary oh you still have to be

2586.45 --> 2589.89
careful but

2594.64 --> 2603.77
do crabs have blue blood well I don't

2600.02 --> 2606.23
know I think I did see crab blood I

2603.77 --> 2609.02
think it looked more purplish but that

2606.23 --> 2611.96
could also because that may be what

2609.02 --> 2615.619
happens when it starts to oxidize but

2611.96 --> 2621.71
like literally cold what we understand

2615.619 --> 2627.38
as blue like blue like this no no but it

2621.71 --> 2631.9700000000003
is more blue maybe more purplish I don't

2627.38 --> 2634.25
know maybe that would be different with

2631.97 --> 2636.3999999999996
really big crabs or something I don't

2634.25 --> 2636.4
know

2637.94 --> 2644.51
[Music]

2645.41 --> 2647.95
who

2651.63 --> 2654.23
okay

2657.78 --> 2663.36
interesting yeah they lie Ohio that it

2661.08 --> 2666.33
sounds very exciting though I wouldn't

2663.36 --> 2668.19
necessarily be scared in the dark it is

2666.33 --> 2668.67
pretty creepy to go out it yeah I did

2668.19 --> 2672.87
that

2668.67 --> 2676.35
not very far though like I have had at

2672.87 --> 2678.06
times like we go with my girlfriend to

2676.35 --> 2679.86
the beach at night and then I would get

2678.06 --> 2682.7999999999997
all brawny and say look you know I'm

2679.86 --> 2686.3
gonna go very far because it was scary

2682.8 --> 2688.86
but then I wouldn't go that far it

2686.3 --> 2691.44
because yeah then I start to imagine

2688.86 --> 2697.58
maybe jellyfish would be coming around

2691.44 --> 2704.4
and I wouldn't notice then yeah then ya

2697.58 --> 2706.89
don't want that but even during the

2704.4 --> 2710.52
daytime one time I was just like in this

2706.89 --> 2712.65
cake moment where just like want to do

2710.52 --> 2714.5099999999998
physical stuff and so I just started

2712.65 --> 2717.0
swimming just started swimming like

2714.51 --> 2719.61
right into the open ocean I was like

2717.0 --> 2721.41
[ __ ] it I'm gonna swim right at this and

2719.61 --> 2724.73
I was basically going and say I was like

2721.41 --> 2729.69
yeah I'm gonna swim to likely to France

2724.73 --> 2734.34
and then like after 15 minutes I was

2729.69 --> 2738.09
like holy [ __ ] what what if I get tired

2734.34 --> 2741.33
ah where am i I can barely see the land

2738.09 --> 2743.2200000000003
anywhere holy [ __ ] that still could

2741.33 --> 2745.2599999999998
orient it so I was like a get the hell

2743.22 --> 2747.72
out here and then because I realized

2745.26 --> 2751.4
what if I got caught in some kind of

2747.72 --> 2757.4399999999996
tide or something so yeah I got back

2751.4 --> 2765.5
full power I think I was like 11 or

2757.44 --> 2765.5
something yeah I wouldn't do that now

2775.13 --> 2783.32
okay Arwen means you're ever that name

2780.75 --> 2787.49
Arwen it's supposed to it's Alvin

2783.32 --> 2792.2400000000002
actually from Lord of the Rings Alvin

2787.49 --> 2794.52
and it's really my name officially it's

2792.24 --> 2796.97
my middle name my mother gave me that

2794.52 --> 2796.97
name

2808.15 --> 2815.09
[Music]

2815.33 --> 2818.35
what is it

2825.52 --> 2836.41
yeah Major Tom I know our win is also an

2830.17 --> 2841.09
alpha name but our win is actually a

2836.41 --> 2844.83
male version of that name you can try it

2841.09 --> 2852.04
out look it up it's real

2844.83 --> 2854.16
that's how elves spell that but it has a

2852.04 --> 2863.68
slightly different meaning though

2854.16 --> 2869.6189999999997
because alpha names have meanings so

2863.68 --> 2873.1
where our win means what is it like of

2869.619 --> 2873.4900000000002
the evening star I think something like

2873.1 --> 2876.49
that

2873.49 --> 2882.0099999999998
was it almost the morning star it was

2876.49 --> 2883.7799999999997
related to his star so our win I J that

2882.01 --> 2887.73
doesn't mean that it means friend of the

2883.78 --> 2887.73
eagle isn't that interesting

2895.51 --> 2898.699
[Music]

2901.24 --> 2906.89
and I have to say though that having

2904.28 --> 2910.82
received this name has influenced me

2906.89 --> 2916.5699999999997
greatly I was always like wow that's so

2910.82 --> 2916.57
special like yeah

2922.44 --> 2927.549
yeah I don't know I think it has

2925.15 --> 2934.2000000000003
influenced even how I perceived my own

2927.549 --> 2934.2
identity in a variety of ways at times

2938.069 --> 2946.21
it's a pain with fight to Flat Earth are

2941.26 --> 2950.65
you serious if he wants he can come on

2946.21 --> 2954.16
my show sure why not he knows I'll be

2950.65 --> 2959.44
civil but yeah as long as he doesn't try

2954.16 --> 2963.67
to manipulate me try to slander use my

2959.44 --> 2966.0
airtime to slander people then so fine

2963.67 --> 2966.0
with me

2983.15 --> 2988.779
okay in German its Aaron is it

2992.49 --> 2998.75
I don't know I don't know it but

3000.63 --> 3007.02
what are you saying that Erwin is the

3004.8 --> 3010.28
are we name in German that's so weird

3007.02 --> 3010.28
what does that even mean

3031.32 --> 3040.01
[Music]

3034.72 --> 3042.74
though I got questions etc well fight

3040.01 --> 3047.6000000000004
the Flat Earth is kind of a scary scary

3042.74 --> 3050.95
guy so it's not a scary cowardly

3047.6 --> 3050.95
assignment and but yeah

3057.7 --> 3062.14
I don't think fight the flat earth can

3059.53 --> 3064.48
handle hostile social situations where

3062.14 --> 3071.8599999999997
he's not just talking to friends

3064.48 --> 3073.51
I think he's not very good at that that

3071.86 --> 3084.34
assignment that is just completely

3073.51 --> 3087.2400000000002
incapable of that probably all right

3084.34 --> 3087.2400000000002
Major Tom I know

3100.49 --> 3105.3199999999997
yeah I know Alexander light-water I

3102.71 --> 3107.45
actually know a guy called Aaron and I

3105.32 --> 3114.05
met him at the flat at the Flat Earth

3107.45 --> 3118.0099999999998
conference in Amsterdam but yeah anyway

3114.05 --> 3122.0800000000004
Arwen is not my front name so I don't

3118.01 --> 3124.67
like to be addressed as Arwen except

3122.08 --> 3129.22
here on the Internet

3124.67 --> 3129.2200000000003
because it's easy to recognize

3150.44 --> 3156.289
well that depends on what you think a

3153.44 --> 3159.98
paid globe she'll actually is I got

3156.289 --> 3164.42
questions I'm pretty sure he's being

3159.98 --> 3167.869
paid by YouTube and he's probably being

3164.42 --> 3172.9300000000003
generously paid by followers so in a way

3167.869 --> 3178.2200000000003
shilling for it I rather think he's just

3172.93 --> 3179.66
trying to fill the market because

3178.22 --> 3181.9399999999996
there's always more market for

3179.66 --> 3185.0
ridiculous globe assertions especially

3181.94 --> 3187.01
new ones and there's a lot of need for

3185.0 --> 3190.339
globe safe spaces because they have no

3187.01 --> 3193.13
arguments they don't like to be reminded

3190.339 --> 3196.13
about that and I think that fight the

3193.13 --> 3198.98
Flat Earth is just filling that market

3196.13 --> 3201.6800000000003
MIT does that make him a seal kind of

3198.98 --> 3204.98
does that mean he is being specifically

3201.68 --> 3206.2889999999998
ordered to do this by some group I don't

3204.98 --> 3209.15
think so

3206.289 --> 3211.13
may he might be goaded a little like

3209.15 --> 3212.48
like oh you're doing this oh that's

3211.13 --> 3214.9100000000003
really good but if you need any advice

3212.48 --> 3217.52
you can always talk to us but that's not

3214.91 --> 3224.24
being ordered that's not a mission

3217.52 --> 3227.029
that's not literally doing it just to be

3224.24 --> 3229.549
paid some big bucks outside I think he's

3227.029 --> 3233.21
just filling the market because again

3229.549 --> 3237.41
there's a lot of need for globe safe

3233.21 --> 3240.789
spaces and more ridiculous globe

3237.41 --> 3240.7889999999998
assertions to fantasize about

3246.39 --> 3252.92
a spacetime filler that's a good one

3250.53 --> 3256.0190000000002
Cleary

3252.92 --> 3256.0190000000002
[Music]

3263.13 --> 3266.649
[Music]

3268.49 --> 3274.08
yeah I understand that I got questions

3271.71 --> 3276.57
and that's why I specifically addressed

3274.08 --> 3279.15
it I don't think so I don't think there

3276.57 --> 3281.7000000000003
is any specific Institute that is

3279.15 --> 3283.92
ordering him to do that now on the other

3281.7 --> 3287.43
hand I don't exactly know how they do

3283.92 --> 3289.71
their thing so it could just be that it

3287.43 --> 3292.1099999999997
works people just think oh yeah I'm

3289.71 --> 3294.42
gonna fill this market people want to

3292.11 --> 3296.369
hear about the globe even though I don't

3294.42 --> 3297.869
really get what's going on I'm just

3296.369 --> 3300.3900000000003
gonna do that and make some money and

3297.869 --> 3302.46
then as they're doing it and they fall

3300.39 --> 3304.92
in line with other globus around them

3302.46 --> 3307.2
they use their methods their tricks then

3304.92 --> 3310.98
maybe those Institute's simply see oh

3307.2 --> 3314.5699999999997
wait he's doing it just right enough

3310.98 --> 3318.59
let's try and approach him see if he'll

3314.57 --> 3323.69
take a bigger ticket something like that

3318.59 --> 3327.09
if he's if he's in for some lollipops

3323.69 --> 3332.7000000000003
could be I don't know I don't think that

3327.09 --> 3336.1400000000003
is even necessary for things to be the

3332.7 --> 3340.0099999999998
way they are currently with these people

3336.14 --> 3340.0099999999998
but it could be I don't know

3349.83 --> 3357.42
all right well Toby what you had the

3352.86 --> 3362.52
preponderance of evidence that the earth

3357.42 --> 3365.63
is not a globe it's pretty conclusive to

3362.52 --> 3365.63
me that the earth is flat

3373.9 --> 3378.2200000000003
and now then yeah it's not a concave

3376.66 --> 3380.5299999999997
either because there is no curvature

3378.22 --> 3382.6299999999997
there's no curvature that should line up

3380.53 --> 3383.92
and it must according to that system

3382.63 --> 3386.53
that's the limit

3383.92 --> 3389.08
I miss flat there is no such limit it's

3386.53 --> 3391.36
just flat and we don't know the confines

3389.08 --> 3394.0299999999997
we don't know what the container is

3391.36 --> 3397.78
specifically there's ideas about it what

3394.03 --> 3402.01
will you don't know but the globe yeah

3397.78 --> 3405.46
it must size up to how it is proposed or

3402.01 --> 3407.65
it's just not true and well it's just on

3405.46 --> 3410.31
every corner it's not true it just turns

3407.65 --> 3414.67
out not to be true it's just all filler

3410.31 --> 3419.61
machination nonsense make-believe so

3414.67 --> 3419.61
yeah what is there left no curvature

3420.0 --> 3426.61
second law of thermodynamics

3423.81 --> 3432.13
what can you go with well a flat

3426.61 --> 3434.31
contained realm that makes sense but

3432.13 --> 3437.17
there is still more to explore about it

3434.31 --> 3440.11
about its features about its layout

3437.17 --> 3443.04
about what's really going on within this

3440.11 --> 3443.04
realm system

3449.65 --> 3455.559
okay I got questions does that mean that

3452.65 --> 3458.309
you are Jason did you come back for

3455.559 --> 3458.309
another banning

3464.81 --> 3470.15
or are you may be ready to actually back

3468.35 --> 3473.38
up your claims for once instead of just

3470.15 --> 3476.38
spouting your belief nonsense just like

3473.38 --> 3476.38
Globus

3486.34 --> 3491.2200000000003
okay alright just checking

3500.48 --> 3505.79
mm-hmm okay yeah you're definitely not

3503.89 --> 3515.7799999999997
Jason that's good

3505.79 --> 3518.089
sorry about that I had to check oh maybe

3515.78 --> 3521.32
you could do better where Jason has been

3518.089 --> 3527.06
failing from the start and actually

3521.32 --> 3528.65
deliver some evidence no not one more

3527.06 --> 3534.56
hour but thank you for the super chat

3528.65 --> 3535.88
Amanda young thank you no but I am

3534.56 --> 3541.97
definitely gonna round out the show

3535.88 --> 3547.19
because I gotta go but I'll be back

whatever back but thank you

3561.22 --> 3566.609
yeah I'm not gonna go into that now

3563.23 --> 3569.02
you'll have to ask the others just

3566.609 --> 3575.71
Jason's just very annoying

3569.02 --> 3578.65
monotone devoid of arguments kind of guy

3575.71 --> 3581.73
like a walking we billboard for his

3578.65 --> 3585.13
beliefs and it is aggravatingly annoying

3581.73 --> 3589.809
that's its aggravating and annoying

3585.13 --> 3591.73
never mind so yeah I'm gonna run out the

3589.809 --> 3594.369
show so thanks everyone for coming I

3591.73 --> 3596.589
