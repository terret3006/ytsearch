really use it

94.92 --> 99.68
so yeah some support would be great

101.52 --> 107.52
I'm gonna buckle

104.1 --> 112.03999999999999
right anyway weather is really dreary

107.52 --> 112.03999999999999
today it's been just non-stop raining

115.74 --> 121.86
clouds are up there rushing by

119.1 --> 125.1
but it's just one giant Cloud soup so

121.86 --> 128.719
it's not really you can't really see

125.1 --> 128.719
much of a difference anywhere

134.459 --> 137.06
right

139.459 --> 145.02
the plants are liking it though it's

141.959 --> 147.84
still kind of warm

145.02 --> 150.26000000000002
but not really it's probably like 19

147.84 --> 150.26
degrees

151.2 --> 154.39999999999998
[Music]

156.06 --> 160.98
looks like it's gonna be a

158.459 --> 163.14000000000001
with a gloomy week if it's going to be

160.98 --> 165.48
like this and the predictions say that

163.14 --> 167.64
it is but

165.48 --> 169.98
we'll see

167.64 --> 172.64
anyway hello Richard G first in chat

169.98 --> 172.64
good to see you

173.16 --> 177.959
oh ski Kos

176.4 --> 181.76000000000002
dank

177.959 --> 181.76
no notification oh

182.7 --> 185.5
huh

184.5 --> 188.939
that's weird

185.5 --> 188.939
[Music]

192.42 --> 198.01899999999998
right so yeah today I don't know I'm not

195.06 --> 198.019
feeling super great

202.68 --> 205.68
uh

205.8 --> 210.54000000000002
I was actually gonna skip Today's show

208.44 --> 213.12
but then I thought like yeah but I want

210.54 --> 215.64
to do a show but I don't know I might

213.12 --> 217.37900000000002
actually cut it short

215.64 --> 221.05999999999997
because I'm just not feeling super

217.379 --> 221.06
strong a bit feeble

230.819 --> 234.83999999999997
it's like this weather is getting to me

232.86 --> 237.06
and I really need to get some proper

234.84 --> 239.28
food also I just found out that my phone

237.06 --> 242.36
isn't working anymore

239.28 --> 242.36
it's really weird

243.0 --> 246.84
so I guess

244.56 --> 247.86
I have to get a new phone after all

246.84 --> 250.26
that's

247.86 --> 253.56
kind of unfortunate because that is

250.26 --> 256.44
gonna cost me some

253.56 --> 259.04
and thus yeah I would really appreciate

256.44 --> 259.04
some support

264.0 --> 267.8
because I'm gonna have to get a new

265.56 --> 267.8
phone

271.5 --> 274.68
it's kind of weird though because

272.639 --> 276.54
they've been warning for like two years

274.68 --> 278.759
about it it's like oh it's gonna turn

276.54 --> 280.74
off really it's gonna turn off

278.759 --> 282.3
and then just wouldn't do it every time

280.74 --> 284.58
so I thought like ah they're just trying

282.3 --> 287.699
to trick me

284.58 --> 290.75899999999996
but apparently it was really turned off

287.699 --> 292.94
just recently like yesterday or

290.759 --> 292.94
something

295.32 --> 298.09999999999997
huh

300.419 --> 306.12
do I think someone is [ __ ] worth the

302.759 --> 308.82
weather no this is just

306.12 --> 312.02
I don't know unfortunately this is

308.82 --> 312.02
typical Dutch weather

312.66 --> 314.84000000000003
foreign

315.62 --> 318.819
[Music]

321.62 --> 326.52
we could still get it pretty decent

324.0 --> 329.58
after summer

326.52 --> 331.68
I mean it's not like it it's guaranteed

329.58 --> 333.85999999999996
to be like this all of August or

331.68 --> 333.86
something

335.759 --> 341.28000000000003
and hey yesterday it was pretty nice

338.1 --> 344.72
weather it really was

341.28 --> 344.71999999999997
very much enjoyed that

348.479 --> 356.899
no truth over comfort and Taylor vision

352.94 --> 356.899
[Music]

359.28 --> 364.67999999999995
right so yeah I'm gonna mostly take it

362.639 --> 368.419
easy today

364.68 --> 368.419
and just kind of see what happens

372.84 --> 378.56
and I'm probably going to be going back

374.82 --> 378.56
and forth to the toil itself

379.259 --> 384.90000000000003
but anyway maybe the second hour I'll be

381.78 --> 388.919
like completely restored back to normal

384.9 --> 390.9
yeah I'm not taking a Gusto drink today

388.919 --> 393.539
because that did not help at all

390.9 --> 396.06
yesterday when I was already starting to

393.539 --> 398.34
feel a little feeble

396.06 --> 399.78000000000003
so I might just be getting kind of sick

398.34 --> 401.94
because of

399.78 --> 404.28
I don't know

401.94 --> 407.96
the cycle

404.28 --> 407.96
and I'm perfectly fine with that

409.74 --> 414.18
I mean it's been ages since I actually

412.139 --> 415.8
got sick so I should actually be like

414.18 --> 417.84000000000003
yeah finally

415.8 --> 419.819
finally an opportunity to clean up

417.84 --> 422.65999999999997
certain toxins that normally just don't

419.819 --> 422.66
get cleaned up

422.759 --> 427.97900000000004
so that's great

424.8 --> 432.06
but yeah

427.979 --> 434.09999999999997
that I also have to eat well

432.06 --> 436.08
although that usually comes afterward

434.1 --> 437.58000000000004
because I'm not feeling super hungry

436.08 --> 439.919
either which is kind of confusing

437.58 --> 442.62
because I do feel like I've not eaten

439.919 --> 446.21999999999997
properly but I'm also not hungry

442.62 --> 448.919
because I'm feeling slightly sickish and

446.22 --> 451.319
thus I have to kind of wait until my

448.919 --> 453.24
body gets to that point where it fixes

451.319 --> 457.199
it

453.24 --> 460.46000000000004
and then gets hungry

457.199 --> 460.46000000000004
yeah I know

461.699 --> 467.06
should we

464.34 --> 467.06
no

468.06 --> 472.039
banks are going to close

472.319 --> 478.099
uh

474.9 --> 478.099
that makes no sense

483.66 --> 487.91900000000004
you've been hearing a lot of fear but

485.52 --> 489.419
look guys there's a lot of fair porn

487.919 --> 492.539
going around

489.419 --> 494.15999999999997
and yeah it's all in those documents but

492.539 --> 496.759
that doesn't mean that they can't just

494.16 --> 496.759
do it because

498.24 --> 504.44
total chaos including any control they

502.259 --> 504.44
had

509.46 --> 514.02
and besides what the [ __ ] are you gonna

511.5 --> 517.08
do with crypto

514.02 --> 518.0989999999999
I I mean sir like what are you who's

517.08 --> 520.0200000000001
gonna

518.099 --> 522.0600000000001
accept crypto

520.02 --> 524.52
for payment

522.06 --> 527.3599999999999
when banks are closed

524.52 --> 527.36
and by the way

527.7 --> 532.62
yeah who's to say that the Internet

529.5 --> 534.3
isn't gonna close down as well then like

532.62 --> 536.4590000000001
what are you gonna do with it nothing

534.3 --> 538.8
it's digital it's like

536.459 --> 540.68
oh everything is closing down quickly

538.8 --> 543.7199999999999
get a purely

540.68 --> 546.54
electronic based product

543.72 --> 549.24
that we're gonna use as a currency

546.54 --> 553.399
uh you mean when they're closing [ __ ]

549.24 --> 556.38
off like I don't know the electricity

553.399 --> 558.12
the internet

556.38 --> 560.22
what the [ __ ] are you gonna do with it

558.12 --> 563.16
then

560.22 --> 565.019
no if anything

563.16 --> 567.48
you should get

565.019 --> 571.58
Goods like

567.48 --> 571.58
durable tradable goods

575.76 --> 579.959
I'd personally go for like things like

578.279 --> 582.8389999999999
gold and silver

579.959 --> 585.2399999999999
especially silver like silver is a good

582.839 --> 587.7790000000001
downtime trade

585.24 --> 587.779
currency

588.72 --> 594.32
like when everything is off silver Works

591.899 --> 594.32
fantastic

594.48 --> 601.519
because it will retain its value

597.839 --> 601.519
and it can't be turned off

601.68 --> 605.3599999999999
so that's what I would do

609.54 --> 613.88
hello

610.8 --> 613.88
scheme Kos

616.5 --> 625.2
did any of you ever buy BTC buy it no

622.44 --> 628.94
but I did trade a little bit of it

625.2 --> 628.94
it's just a minute amount

629.54 --> 634.92
I mean yeah this stuff blur crypto it's

633.12 --> 636.54
still gonna be out there but I mean if

634.92 --> 637.68
the internet is close what the [ __ ] are

636.54 --> 639.06
you gonna do

637.68 --> 640.9799999999999
nothing

639.06 --> 642.779
you can't reach it probably you got it

640.98 --> 645.66
on some online wallet

642.779 --> 647.959
whatever yeah it's you can't reach it so

645.66 --> 651.18
it's still there

647.959 --> 654.6099999999999
unless like servers get like completely

651.18 --> 657.8199999999999
wiped for some crazy reason

654.61 --> 657.82
[Music]

660.48 --> 666.0600000000001
but I mean crypto is not a downtime

664.019 --> 668.279
currency

666.06 --> 671.16
it is an uptime current it's like it

668.279 --> 674.279
works when there's a lot of prosperity a

671.16 --> 676.5
lot of money and then governments try to

674.279 --> 678.42
[ __ ] around with it and manipulate you

676.5 --> 680.82
and try to go to you with the current

678.42 --> 682.56
season that's where you want to go for

680.82 --> 684.3000000000001
crypto

682.56 --> 685.5
because there's

684.3 --> 688.019
like

685.5 --> 692.16
a lot of opportunity and that gives you

688.019 --> 695.339
kind of a way to bypass some of that

692.16 --> 698.2199999999999
top-down manipulation but if everything

695.339 --> 700.0790000000001
goes down like what are you gonna do

698.22 --> 701.94
nothing

700.079 --> 705.3599999999999
who's going to be crazy enough to take

701.94 --> 707.339
it well you people would only be taking

705.36 --> 709.6800000000001
cryptocurrency

707.339 --> 711.6
like when the internet goes down when

709.68 --> 714.779
they're absolutely certain that it's

711.6 --> 716.88
going to be like back up

714.779 --> 719.579
but if it's like going down and there's

716.88 --> 721.26
no further notice yeah nobody's going to

719.579 --> 723.899
be stupid enough

721.26 --> 725.519
except for really stupid people to

723.899 --> 727.26
accept it

725.519 --> 728.82
I mean there might be some people that

727.26 --> 730.079
are going to be like yeah bring it on

728.82 --> 731.519
I'll take it

730.079 --> 733.38
and then they're gonna sit on it and

731.519 --> 735.0
then the internet doesn't go back on and

733.38 --> 736.92
then it turns out it was all worthless

735.0 --> 741.14
because what are you gonna do nothing

736.92 --> 741.14
nobody's gonna buy it you bought it

741.42 --> 747.12
so

743.82 --> 749.5400000000001
yeah it's not a downtime currency that's

747.12 --> 749.54
for sure

750.48 --> 756.36
gold coins no tax rights well you can

754.32 --> 757.5600000000001
technically just say you're just

756.36 --> 760.78
bartering

757.56 --> 760.78
[Music]

762.899 --> 767.399
right

765.14 --> 769.8
[Music]

767.399 --> 771.72
anyway like one of the best currencies

769.8 --> 774.0
you'll have is

771.72 --> 775.98
food production

774.0 --> 778.019
because food's always going to be in

775.98 --> 780.72
demand

778.019 --> 782.94
even more when like stuff goes down

780.72 --> 785.7
because a lot of food has been dependent

782.94 --> 789.24
on electronics

785.7 --> 792.24
to like stay fresh Etc so like having

789.24 --> 794.339
fresh food production

792.24 --> 796.38
that's gonna be like the best currency

794.339 --> 798.72
ever in downtime

796.38 --> 799.62
there will be more need for food and

798.72 --> 803.0400000000001
less

799.62 --> 804.9590000000001
available and so people will always will

803.04 --> 807.12
take it

804.959 --> 808.8
like even if they don't want to eat that

807.12 --> 812.54
specific thing they'll still take it

808.8 --> 812.54
because they know like yeah that's

812.94 --> 820.1
like other people will want that and

815.88 --> 820.1
they'll trade their stuff for it

835.2 --> 838.2
right and you can also in that sense

837.18 --> 841.4399999999999
make

838.2 --> 843.9590000000001
a trade system using here this might be

841.44 --> 847.5600000000001
funny this is actually potentially a

843.959 --> 850.38
really good idea potentially

847.56 --> 855.3199999999999
you could make a

850.38 --> 855.32
food based fiat currency

855.779 --> 859.4399999999999
I just came up with this

857.82 --> 861.839
this is really weird I didn't expect

859.44 --> 864.7790000000001
that to happen but you can make a

861.839 --> 867.48
food-based promissory note

864.779 --> 869.7
trade system right because a lot of food

867.48 --> 872.4590000000001
production it happens all at once and

869.7 --> 876.0
then you get all that stuff all at once

872.459 --> 879.5999999999999
right it's like oh apple harvest okay we

876.0 --> 882.3
got a ton of apples uh and then well

879.6 --> 884.22
without electricity after a while it's

882.3 --> 886.019
gonna start rotting and you have to like

884.22 --> 888.98
turn it into

886.019 --> 888.98
something else

889.38 --> 896.399
apple yeah apple juice or

893.339 --> 899.22
or something fermented

896.399 --> 902.76
liquor whatever

899.22 --> 902.76
right but

903.839 --> 908.639
because of that it's not like a oh oh

906.899 --> 910.199
I'll just trade you an apple well I'll

908.639 --> 912.66
sit on that Apple for half a year and

910.199 --> 915.54
then they'll trade it no no but it's

912.66 --> 918.12
gonna be needed when it's consumed of

915.54 --> 920.699
course but you can make promissory notes

918.12 --> 924.12
like hey I have an apple

920.699 --> 927.0
Vineyard or like a you know what I mean

924.12 --> 928.86
a plantation thing lots of apples but

927.0 --> 931.079
they only come one point in a year and

928.86 --> 933.0600000000001
then I have a lot of surplus well then

931.079 --> 935.16
you can like say can I have this thing

933.06 --> 937.3199999999999
and you can have

935.16 --> 939.899
all the apples

937.32 --> 942.0
you can carry it or like you can have a

939.899 --> 945.68
basket full of apples for that

942.0 --> 945.68
but it's going to be in that season

948.42 --> 954.899
right be ready

951.839 --> 957.4200000000001
here's the date where I'm gonna do that

954.899 --> 960.18
in you with this coupon you can have

957.42 --> 962.519
like an entire basket the the best

960.18 --> 964.26
apples you can find

962.519 --> 967.16
and you can have them for free with it

964.26 --> 967.16
and that's the trade

970.32 --> 975.72
right and then they can even trade that

973.019 --> 979.199
note after somebody else that's gonna be

975.72 --> 981.48
like yeah man but I got I got these

979.199 --> 984.779
apples but I already had like this other

981.48 --> 986.1
stuff but this guy actually likes to

984.779 --> 987.779
make liquor

986.1 --> 990.6
so

987.779 --> 992.639
he really wants those apples because he

990.6 --> 995.82
wants to make liquor out of them

992.639 --> 997.86
and then he can trade that off right

995.82 --> 1000.8000000000001
promissory notes

997.86 --> 1003.74
based on harvest times

1000.8 --> 1007.3389999999999
it's like a fiat currency except it's

1003.74 --> 1009.0790000000001
based on food

1007.339 --> 1010.6990000000001
right and a promissory note in that

1009.079 --> 1013.16
sense can expire

1010.699 --> 1017.5
because it's like yeah you get a coupon

1013.16 --> 1020.0
for the apple harvest of this year

1017.5 --> 1022.339
right and then it's like oh yeah I

1020.0 --> 1024.62
forgot the next year like ah can I have

1022.339 --> 1026.3600000000001
it yeah that was last year

1024.62 --> 1029.1789999999999
like

1026.36 --> 1031.52
and maybe they'll be like ah [ __ ] it I

1029.179 --> 1034.4
like you you can use it anyway right

1031.52 --> 1036.679
because I mean most of the time

1034.4 --> 1038.6000000000001
they're still gonna be Surplus no matter

1036.679 --> 1041.24
what

1038.6 --> 1044.4189999999999
it's actually like successful farmers

1041.24 --> 1047.299
and people with orchards

1044.419 --> 1051.0800000000002
the most the time the issue is that they

1047.299 --> 1054.02
end up with too much food to the to use

1051.08 --> 1056.48
or trade away literally

1054.02 --> 1060.02
like

1056.48 --> 1063.799
unless they're not very ambitious and

1060.02 --> 1066.44
and they're not very they're lazy and

1063.799 --> 1068.78
then they don't produce that much and a

1066.44 --> 1071.0
lot of crops fail Etc right

1068.78 --> 1073.22
what I mean it is

1071.0 --> 1074.72
a viable way to go around when

1073.22 --> 1078.32
everything goes down when there's no

1074.72 --> 1080.539
banks when there's no electricity even

1078.32 --> 1083.059
while farmers will then start making

1080.539 --> 1085.58
their own electricity

1083.059 --> 1087.5
right and they got like they got diesel

1085.58 --> 1089.8999999999999
engines and they can even make biodies

1087.5 --> 1091.28
like a lot of farmers at least in the

1089.9 --> 1093.6200000000001
Netherlands

1091.28 --> 1094.58
very self-sufficient and very prepared

1093.62 --> 1097.039
for that

1094.58 --> 1098.48
but I mean if everything goes down like

1097.039 --> 1100.82
that

1098.48 --> 1104.059
and we still got those Farmers that

1100.82 --> 1107.1789999999999
means we survive you see because they

1104.059 --> 1109.82
will probably do what I just said they

1107.179 --> 1112.46
will probably do a promissory note-based

1109.82 --> 1114.1399999999999
currency system for trade

1112.46 --> 1116.6000000000001
and then everybody

1114.14 --> 1120.7
will be yeah and by the way you can do

1116.6 --> 1120.6999999999998
that for services too

1123.679 --> 1128.7800000000002
right so so basically what I'm

1125.78 --> 1130.22
describing here is just basic

1128.78 --> 1132.74
Contracting

1130.22 --> 1136.419
it's like basic contracts which is what

1132.74 --> 1136.419
a fiat currency really is

1139.22 --> 1144.1000000000001
it's a representation of something else

1141.26 --> 1144.1
that you trade around

1144.679 --> 1148.76
hmm

1146.23 --> 1151.28
[Music]

1148.76 --> 1156.22
and you can do that with food products

1151.28 --> 1156.22
or with surfaces like unique surfaces

1156.74 --> 1162.799
or well yeah or even non-food products

1160.1 --> 1163.82
just like a piece of Machinery let's say

1162.799 --> 1166.52
you're

1163.82 --> 1167.78
a metal worker and a machinist and you

1166.52 --> 1169.4
can make

1167.78 --> 1172.6399999999999
engines

1169.4 --> 1175.94
that's super awesome I mean and if you

1172.64 --> 1178.2800000000002
can make diesel engines

1175.94 --> 1180.74
without

1178.28 --> 1182.84
like they would be more primitive but if

1180.74 --> 1187.4
you can actually get them

1182.84 --> 1189.32
to work with relatively simple materials

1187.4 --> 1191.9
that you can make them without having

1189.32 --> 1193.1
like this I don't know that's super high

1191.9 --> 1195.6200000000001
tech

1193.1 --> 1197.36
casting systems and Robotics and all

1195.62 --> 1199.52
that right like what they use typically

1197.36 --> 1202.4599999999998
now but if you could still make them

1199.52 --> 1205.52
relatively primitive well then

1202.46 --> 1207.679
you basically are the one that might

1205.52 --> 1209.9
guarantee that there will still be

1207.679 --> 1213.5800000000002
electricity around

1209.9 --> 1213.5800000000002
after a long long time

1214.58 --> 1219.559
extremely valuable skill

1217.039 --> 1222.26
if you can do such things

1219.559 --> 1224.299
right although there might simply be so

1222.26 --> 1227.36
many engines around if you know how to

1224.299 --> 1231.28
like re-tailor them to like

1227.36 --> 1234.1399999999999
like de-electronify them

1231.28 --> 1236.4189999999999
so that they're like more basic engines

1234.14 --> 1239.419
that would work or you could like

1236.419 --> 1241.16
recycle old engines probably that would

1239.419 --> 1244.039
work better

1241.16 --> 1245.78
like refit them like older engines that

1244.039 --> 1249.1
don't have all the electronic garbage

1245.78 --> 1249.1
that they have nowadays

1249.74 --> 1254.86
right

1252.08 --> 1259.72
so yeah those are some tips there

1254.86 --> 1259.7199999999998
instead of investing in cryptocurrency

1265.94 --> 1271.39
hey Amanda young good to see you

1268.25 --> 1271.39
[Music]

1272.6 --> 1277.6599999999999
orders boy they're at 306.

1282.62 --> 1287.6599999999999
how can it be backed up by food it's

1284.96 --> 1290.539
called promissory notes

1287.66 --> 1293.179
it's basically expiring money but I mean

1290.539 --> 1296.02
it's still worth it I mean people need

1293.179 --> 1296.02
will need food

1296.78 --> 1299.62
right I mean

1300.82 --> 1306.3799999999999
surfaces are like a one-time thing too

1303.799 --> 1308.48
they technically don't expire because

1306.38 --> 1310.22
you can just like hold it off

1308.48 --> 1312.44
it's like oh yeah you can still do the

1310.22 --> 1315.32
same thing you promised in 10 years if

1312.44 --> 1318.44
that's when they want it

1315.32 --> 1321.3799999999999
food yeah when it's produced then it has

1318.44 --> 1324.039
an expiration date

1321.38 --> 1324.0390000000002
but

1324.5 --> 1330.08
yeah

1326.84 --> 1332.12
it's it can both work

1330.08 --> 1334.6399999999999
people have

1332.12 --> 1338.1789999999999
skills they can utilize and they still

1334.64 --> 1339.98
need food so that can let's like give me

1338.179 --> 1341.1200000000001
some of that food I give you some of my

1339.98 --> 1343.46
skills

1341.12 --> 1347.059
and if you have like this if you have

1343.46 --> 1349.88
like a team teamwork in this kind of

1347.059 --> 1354.02
thing you can have like basic industries

1349.88 --> 1356.1200000000001
that can be extremely well oiled even

1354.02 --> 1358.52
if you have a close tied copper

1356.12 --> 1362.6
cooperation like that

1358.52 --> 1366.2
it it basically starts bordering the way

1362.6 --> 1369.86
things work in a commune except they're

1366.2 --> 1373.6000000000001
still like a trade mechanism that guides

1369.86 --> 1373.6
it that's very rudimentary

1373.82 --> 1377.559
it's still based on economy

1386.419 --> 1391.179
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

1388.159 --> 1391.179
truth over comfort

1392.6 --> 1400.0
why are you a bunch of idiots like oh

1396.02 --> 1400.0
it's gonna go buy it in it

1404.419 --> 1409.24
how can it be standardized it can't

1413.299 --> 1420.08
it's all based on the individual and

1417.62 --> 1422.4799999999998
what they have to offer and there's

1420.08 --> 1424.6399999999999
gonna be trust issues too and I mean

1422.48 --> 1426.679
look if such a thing would really hit

1424.64 --> 1430.1000000000001
off that would eventually be like

1426.679 --> 1432.3400000000001
Arbiter people that are like I'm the

1430.1 --> 1435.4399999999998
quality control like I'm here to check

1432.34 --> 1438.02
if you actually

1435.44 --> 1440.3600000000001
are capable of delivering on your

1438.02 --> 1442.94
promise like I'm gonna check out your

1440.36 --> 1445.1
crops if they are doing as well as you

1442.94 --> 1448.8200000000002
said that they would that's still going

1445.1 --> 1451.1
on or if you're still producing right

1448.82 --> 1452.0
like if you can still demonstrate your

1451.1 --> 1454.2199999999998
skill

1452.0 --> 1456.559
right that would then happen to like

1454.22 --> 1458.179
have a quality control and and then at

1456.559 --> 1462.74
that point

1458.179 --> 1462.74
it will become more standardizable

1463.28 --> 1468.32
but before there is quality control like

1466.159 --> 1470.179
that it's gonna be like yeah you're just

1468.32 --> 1471.86
gonna have to risk it like do you know

1470.179 --> 1474.02
this person

1471.86 --> 1476.299
knowing the people will be extremely

1474.02 --> 1478.28
valuable so it's it's gonna be make it a

1476.299 --> 1480.26
very local it's like yeah I know my

1478.28 --> 1481.34
neighbors I know what they can do we

1480.26 --> 1485.2
Trace

1481.34 --> 1485.1999999999998
that's the most logical outcome

1485.32 --> 1490.039
because if there's Outsiders you don't

1488.12 --> 1491.8999999999999
know them well then you don't know how

1490.039 --> 1494.0
well they are they might be real smooth

1491.9 --> 1496.039
talkers

1494.0 --> 1498.02
and they might even be really good at

1496.039 --> 1500.559
faking things and then they can try to

1498.02 --> 1500.559
rip you off

1501.38 --> 1505.7600000000002
right although with promissory notes it

1504.38 --> 1509.0
does work

1505.76 --> 1511.7
because if it's like yeah I can do this

1509.0 --> 1514.64
and that can I have some of these apples

1511.7 --> 1516.2
that you just harvested in trade well if

1514.64 --> 1519.3200000000002
you just give them away and they turn

1516.2 --> 1520.82
out not to be good at all

1519.32 --> 1524.0
well then

1520.82 --> 1525.74
you just wasted all those apples on the

1524.0 --> 1528.02
on The Pretender

1525.74 --> 1530.0
on the scammer

1528.02 --> 1532.76
but if it's a promissory note it's like

1530.0 --> 1534.98
not yet well then it's like okay well

1532.76 --> 1537.919
deliver then show me what you got

1534.98 --> 1541.1
and if they really suck and it's like

1537.919 --> 1543.26
yeah I withdraw the deal

1541.1 --> 1545.3799999999999
you're not getting those apples in the

1543.26 --> 1545.3799999999999
future

1547.1 --> 1551.1999999999998
you can keep your product

1552.05 --> 1555.51
[Music]

1555.86 --> 1559.76
so

1557.12 --> 1561.26
it shouldn't be all that bad and

1559.76 --> 1563.779
unstable

1561.26 --> 1566.24
it can very well work and I mean

1563.779 --> 1569.84
logically this is how they would have

1566.24 --> 1572.179
gone around a lot in medieval times

1569.84 --> 1575.779
especially in the locations where they

1572.179 --> 1577.88
didn't have like Precious Metals to use

1575.779 --> 1580.419
as a standard currency

1577.88 --> 1583.1000000000001
and hey a lot of the times

1580.419 --> 1585.38
Lords back then would also just

1583.1 --> 1587.8999999999999
literally steal everybody's money it's

1585.38 --> 1590.96
like yeah we're we're having a war

1587.9 --> 1593.299
everybody must give everything

1590.96 --> 1597.14
if you end up hiding you you get

1593.299 --> 1599.48
executed if you end up hiding money and

1597.14 --> 1601.76
then people would be like yeah well we

1599.48 --> 1603.679
don't want to die so take it

1601.76 --> 1606.5
but then you have nothing to trade so

1603.679 --> 1609.3400000000001
then it's like okay we're gonna have a

1606.5 --> 1609.34
promissory system

1609.44 --> 1616.22
or just use a person with a piece of

1613.52 --> 1618.08
paper that will make notes and it'll

1616.22 --> 1620.539
keep track and that's how we then trade

1618.08 --> 1622.22
that's how they probably used to do it

1620.539 --> 1625.1589999999999
in medieval times

1622.22 --> 1628.72
a lot so it will be very similar to the

1625.159 --> 1628.72
system as what I propose

1629.419 --> 1635.539
if your food expires then well then

1633.2 --> 1636.679
well you people should be informed about

1635.539 --> 1638.72
it

1636.679 --> 1641.9
it's like yeah you're gonna buy apples

1638.72 --> 1644.76
you realize those apples have about this

1641.9 --> 1646.22
long a time before they start to rock

1644.76 --> 1648.26
[Music]

1646.22 --> 1650.84
unless you have them really cool then

1648.26 --> 1654.32
then they have them like twice that time

1650.84 --> 1656.4189999999999
or something right so foreign

1654.32 --> 1659.12
yeah if you don't know anything about

1656.419 --> 1661.3400000000001
the things yeah you might make a end of

1659.12 --> 1663.1999999999998
a making really stupid decisions and

1661.34 --> 1665.8999999999999
losing

1663.2 --> 1667.76
your value your pro the value of your

1665.9 --> 1668.72
product and then no longer be able to

1667.76 --> 1671.8799999999999
trade so

1668.72 --> 1671.88
[Music]

1672.02 --> 1676.46
if your food expires yeah then it's

1674.0 --> 1680.74
worthless unless you can find another if

1676.46 --> 1680.74
unless there's a repurpose for it I mean

1681.14 --> 1686.779
it might still be doable as food for

1684.559 --> 1688.3999999999999
animals or something right even when

1686.779 --> 1691.64
it's not

1688.4 --> 1693.5590000000002
doable for eating for people

1691.64 --> 1697.3400000000001
right

1693.559 --> 1699.799
it's it works it just works and people

1697.34 --> 1701.1789999999999
people have survived

1699.799 --> 1702.62
on this

1701.179 --> 1705.74
on

1702.62 --> 1708.799
as long as you have actual room and

1705.74 --> 1710.96
freedom to produce things

1708.799 --> 1714.34
without getting robbed and attacked all

1710.96 --> 1714.3400000000001
the time this works

1717.14 --> 1722.74
meat and milk for milk Farmers no well

1719.9 --> 1722.74
meat will be

1723.38 --> 1728.8400000000001
yeah it will be there still

1726.02 --> 1730.279
and it will be extremely precious you're

1728.84 --> 1733.52
right

1730.279 --> 1736.039
milk also because there's just so much

1733.52 --> 1738.32
good that you can do with it but you

1736.039 --> 1741.679
realize that milk farmers are still

1738.32 --> 1743.8999999999999
dependent on food all that cattle does

1741.679 --> 1746.419
need to eat

1743.9 --> 1749.44
so it can be tricky

1746.419 --> 1752.48
milk Farmers that don't have like direct

1749.44 --> 1754.8200000000002
availability of food production for

1752.48 --> 1757.299
their cattle will actually have a very

1754.82 --> 1757.299
hard time

1759.2 --> 1762.5800000000002
so it's a bit tricky

1763.64 --> 1768.5590000000002
right people tend to forget that that

1765.86 --> 1771.3799999999999
cows actually need to eat

1768.559 --> 1776.1789999999999
like every day

1771.38 --> 1778.3990000000001
and not a real little amount either I

1776.179 --> 1780.74
mean people need to eat well cows are a

1778.399 --> 1781.9399999999998
lot bigger and they need more

1780.74 --> 1786.279
so

1781.94 --> 1786.279
you gotta take that into account as well

1787.58 --> 1793.299
otherwise yeah you end up with a lot of

1789.679 --> 1793.299
meat and then no more cows

1794.21 --> 1798.98
[Music]

1796.64 --> 1802.3990000000001
what about rice Farmers I don't know

1798.98 --> 1804.08
about that that might still work I mean

1802.399 --> 1807.08
if

1804.08 --> 1810.399
Farms are relatively passive in their

1807.08 --> 1810.399
setup yeah that works great

1830.08 --> 1836.48
right but I mean tear it look if

1833.419 --> 1840.3200000000002
electricity goes down yeah India will be

1836.48 --> 1843.08
Rice King as you say but I mean

1840.32 --> 1844.6399999999999
is mostly India everything is rice then

1843.08 --> 1847.12
right that's what would happen because

1844.64 --> 1851.96
you gotta realize if electricity goes

1847.12 --> 1855.02
then International Trade goes to

1851.96 --> 1857.72
right I mean

1855.02 --> 1861.2
well there might be like oh wow an

1857.72 --> 1864.6200000000001
Indian ship just arrived like a big

1861.2 --> 1866.659
tanker completely stuck stuffed with

1864.62 --> 1870.799
rice and it's like yeah we have rice

1866.659 --> 1873.14
supply for potentially a hundred years

1870.799 --> 1876.08
what will you trade

1873.14 --> 1879.26
it's like a giant rice ship will just go

1876.08 --> 1882.4399999999998
by country or region by region see how

1879.26 --> 1886.059
much they can trade for other stuff

1882.44 --> 1886.059
right that that could work

1887.659 --> 1892.72
if a country decides to start doing that

1897.32 --> 1902.6589999999999
stop being a consumer uh

1906.86 --> 1911.12
what percentage of population can we

1909.559 --> 1914.02
producer

1911.12 --> 1914.02
very high

1934.22 --> 1938.0
government is dependent on supermarkets

1936.38 --> 1939.38
made Gardens

1938.0 --> 1941.179
well

1939.38 --> 1943.5800000000002
Maybe

1941.179 --> 1946.3990000000001
but I mean a supermarket is basically

1943.58 --> 1949.9399999999998
just a market a market is just a place

1946.399 --> 1952.4189999999999
where the farmer brings his crops for

1949.94 --> 1952.419
trade

1954.559 --> 1962.299
so if your Supermarket is actually very

1958.34 --> 1964.8799999999999
local oriented it's like sourcing its

1962.299 --> 1968.72
vegetables like my organic Supermarket

1964.88 --> 1969.74
does yeah like every fruit and every

1968.72 --> 1975.1000000000001
crop

1969.74 --> 1975.1
vegetable has the country of origin

1979.1 --> 1983.899
so

1980.539 --> 1986.24
you can have like very local oriented

1983.899 --> 1988.52
supermarkets

1986.24 --> 1989.8990000000001
it's like yeah we got the crops that our

1988.52 --> 1992.84
Farmers got

1989.899 --> 1995.6589999999999
and some other stuff too but

1992.84 --> 1998.62
but we've really focused food wise on on

1995.659 --> 1998.6200000000001
the local stuff

2002.04 --> 2005.349
[Music]

2007.72 --> 2011.019
what about large person non-producers

2009.7 --> 2013.559
well

2011.019 --> 2013.559
service

2014.44 --> 2018.059
it's producer service

2019.36 --> 2022.4299999999998
[Music]

2035.019 --> 2040.299
okay Godzilla

2037.96 --> 2043.559
right anyway I'm gonna take a bit of a

2040.299 --> 2043.559
break I'll be right back

2051.0 --> 2054.309
[Music]

2108.16 --> 2110.7599999999998
foreign

2190.599 --> 2193.599
foreign

2205.119 --> 2208.839
see how this is different from the

2207.28 --> 2211.02
current it isn't different from the

2208.839 --> 2211.02
current

2211.48 --> 2217.48
what do you think that I was

2214.18 --> 2219.8199999999997
sharing oh we have to completely change

2217.48 --> 2222.04
everything around now this was simply

2219.82 --> 2225.1600000000003
the scenario

2222.04 --> 2228.04
on how to survive if electricity and

2225.16 --> 2230.46
internet goes down turret

2228.04 --> 2230.46
oh

2230.74 --> 2234.7599999999998
of course it's not much different from

2233.2 --> 2236.9199999999996
the current because that's just how the

2234.76 --> 2239.2200000000003
world works it's just how do you keep it

2236.92 --> 2239.2200000000003
working

2261.94 --> 2266.94
okay slow mo moon buggy foreign

2315.3 --> 2320.6800000000003
nobody cares

2317.5 --> 2322.9
we don't care about your crypto deal

2320.68 --> 2324.64
that you're considering

2322.9 --> 2327.839
okay

2324.64 --> 2327.839
ever considered that

2331.66 --> 2339.2999999999997
like unless your actions there is going

2335.26 --> 2341.44
to result into you sending me

2339.3 --> 2344.98
usdt tether

2341.44 --> 2347.94
I'm not interested and probably no so so

2344.98 --> 2347.94
is nobody else here

2370.38 --> 2374.32
oh my God thoughts on the board Rising

2373.18 --> 2377.44
Earth

2374.32 --> 2381.42
yeah it's a very cute concept that I

2377.44 --> 2381.42
come across many times before

2382.06 --> 2387.46
I literally even brought it up like

2385.48 --> 2388.48
during like one of my flatter talks I

2387.46 --> 2393.3
think

2388.48 --> 2393.3
and it's literally unprovable

2394.119 --> 2399.579
like there's nothing you could ever do

2396.28 --> 2402.52
to prove whether it's the case or not

2399.579 --> 2405.2200000000003
but it's a nice little concept

2402.52 --> 2407.68
like I like it it's it's interesting it

2405.22 --> 2410.02
makes you think

2407.68 --> 2411.339
it's basically what causes relative

2410.02 --> 2414.579
density

2411.339 --> 2416.38
well this

2414.579 --> 2418.0600000000004
because if it weren't the case

2416.38 --> 2421.2400000000002
everything would be free floating yeah

2418.06 --> 2423.5789999999997
that's cute you can never prove it

2421.24 --> 2425.56
but mechanically it's interesting it's

2423.579 --> 2427.02
an interesting concept

2425.56 --> 2432.4
that

2427.02 --> 2436.44
definitively can never be proven

2432.4 --> 2436.44
just to make that absolutely clear

2437.44 --> 2442.7400000000002
[Music]

2439.839 --> 2445.96
it's not like there is no proof it is

2442.74 --> 2448.24
unprovable definitively

2445.96 --> 2451.18
it's not like there isn't any proof it's

2448.24 --> 2452.74
unprovable specifically this is a whole

2451.18 --> 2455.2599999999998
nother category

2452.74 --> 2457.839
right it makes it an aberration if

2455.26 --> 2460.6600000000003
you're gonna latch onto that it's a very

2457.839 --> 2461.88
cheap fall into an aberration

2460.66 --> 2465.3999999999996
because

2461.88 --> 2469.02
there it has to be no

2465.4 --> 2469.02
it can never prove it

2477.28 --> 2481.96
you can make up and down it's because of

2479.5 --> 2484.839
mechanics Godzilla has nothing to do

2481.96 --> 2488.2
with oh what the Lord can do and not

2484.839 --> 2491.339
it's about what's happening

2488.2 --> 2491.339
that's what it's about

2493.78 --> 2499.78
or like how would the Lord Do It

2497.44 --> 2501.82
and upwards Rising Earth is one of those

2499.78 --> 2504.1600000000003
conceptions it's very mechanical in

2501.82 --> 2506.8
nature that's why it was thought up

2504.16 --> 2510.24
another one is is like a pendulum Earth

2506.8 --> 2512.079
pendulum Earth is much more viable

2510.24 --> 2515.14
architecturally

2512.079 --> 2518.44
it's pretty much the same concept except

2515.14 --> 2520.44
instead of accelerating up it's

2518.44 --> 2523.66
the steady

2520.44 --> 2526.02
centrifugal force that's causing the

2523.66 --> 2526.02
axis

2532.599 --> 2535.6800000000003
low M appeal

2538.06 --> 2543.24
comes off being very silly yeah sure it

2541.119 --> 2543.2400000000002
is

2547.06 --> 2551.92
if you're going to visualize it which is

2549.46 --> 2553.18
very easy by the way yeah that's very

2551.92 --> 2555.16
silly

2553.18 --> 2559.18
also there is like existential

2555.16 --> 2561.94
mechanical problems with the Act

2559.18 --> 2565.0
of moving within a space

2561.94 --> 2566.8
especially when it's acceleration based

2565.0 --> 2570.0
because that means infinite distance

2566.8 --> 2570.0
potentially like

2570.28 --> 2574.48
how are you going to justify how can

2572.14 --> 2577.359
this work

2574.48 --> 2580.3
was this infinite at best

2577.359 --> 2582.7
and and then if there's infinite Abyss

2580.3 --> 2583.54
to move in then why is it moving in

2582.7 --> 2587.02
there

2583.54 --> 2589.359
you see so you end up with like an

2587.02 --> 2593.04
inexplicable element

2589.359 --> 2593.04
no matter what like that

2593.619 --> 2599.8
conceptually

2595.78 --> 2602.6800000000003
and all of it unprovable so it's it's

2599.8 --> 2605.02
kind of a dead end reasoning that's why

2602.68 --> 2607.8999999999996
I'm not really enthusiastic about it I

2605.02 --> 2610.359
mean think it's entertaining but it's

2607.9 --> 2613.319
just a dead end

2610.359 --> 2613.319
that's what it is

2614.8 --> 2619.9
right I mean we should be more concerned

2617.56 --> 2622.9
trying to figure out

2619.9 --> 2625.96
the actual confines of the realm

2622.9 --> 2628.48
let's just see how the realm is oriented

2625.96 --> 2631.7200000000003
first before we start to figure out what

2628.48 --> 2634.72
what the entirety of it is or does

2631.72 --> 2634.72

2699.76 --> 2707.5
hey weird sorry about that

2703.319 --> 2709.54
somebody is doing something there

2707.5 --> 2711.64
I think somebody's been on the roof for

2709.54 --> 2714.7799999999997
maintenance but

2711.64 --> 2714.7799999999997
weird whatever

2723.94 --> 2730.56
yeah see you later Tara 306 thanks

2727.24 --> 2730.56

I don't know

2854.859 --> 2859.06
I mean if

2856.48 --> 2861.119
if there's gonna be some currency change

2859.06 --> 2864.359
all of a sudden it won't really be

2887.8 --> 2892.96
no it's not bad

2889.72 --> 2894.3999999999996
it's very silly though like too silly

2892.96 --> 2895.7200000000003
for my doing

2894.4 --> 2898.98

2895.72 --> 2898.98
it's a nice attempt

2910.18 --> 2913.3799999999997
yeah that's right George

2936.76 --> 2940.92
right exactly I'm a few

2955.74 --> 2962.9399999999996
do you switch your

2958.78 --> 2962.94
picture around regularly

2965.079 --> 2969.9
this is like the third photo I've seen

2967.48 --> 2969.9
of you

2974.859 --> 2977.88
like within a week

3002.22 --> 3005.3999999999996
what are you gonna do with the digital

3004.26 --> 3009.5
money

3005.4 --> 3009.5
yeah truth of comfort you you

3009.54 --> 3015.68
don't you get it

3011.46 --> 3015.68
no banks no crypto

3016.56 --> 3024.02
[Music]

3019.5 --> 3028.02
crypto only works because banks will

3024.02 --> 3030.359
exchange it into actual money that you

3028.02 --> 3035.339
can use to buy things with

3030.359 --> 3036.96
yeah if a crypto can't be exchanged into

3035.339 --> 3039.92
money

3036.96 --> 3039.92
it's worthless

3042.0 --> 3047.819
it's like part of the problems with DTI

3046.079 --> 3049.8590000000004
is that they're like it's like they're

3047.819 --> 3052.92
being boycotted

3049.859 --> 3055.7999999999997
so it's very tough to get

3052.92 --> 3056.76
the stock to get recognition for the

3055.8 --> 3058.7400000000002
product

3056.76 --> 3062.0
for the crypto

3058.74 --> 3062.0
that's its problem

3086.04 --> 3089.94
and Convert digital money into physical

3088.319 --> 3093.54
yeah

3089.94 --> 3098.099
how do you do that exactly

3093.54 --> 3102.599
is there a bank required that will

3098.099 --> 3106.04
accept that exchange of conversion from

3102.599 --> 3106.04
digital money to physical money

3113.22 --> 3120.1189999999997
look dude no banks no crypto you don't

3117.54 --> 3123.0589999999997
seem to be getting this

3120.119 --> 3125.339
I know this from from the start I've

3123.059 --> 3128.099
been saying that years ago

3125.339 --> 3133.7
I mean it's all very nice and cool

3128.099 --> 3133.7000000000003
but no banks no crypto

3134.76 --> 3141.0
without banks crypto is toilet paper

3139.14 --> 3144.7799999999997
less than toilet paper because you can

3141.0 --> 3148.02
use and expand toilet paper crypto

3144.78 --> 3152.4
without it being accepted by Banks is

3148.02 --> 3153.319
literally worth less than nothing

3152.4 --> 3155.04
foreign

3153.319 --> 3157.5
because

3155.04 --> 3160.98
nothing you can get out of it and it

3157.5 --> 3163.5
only takes up electricity and space in

3160.98 --> 3164.76
digital place which requires electricity

3163.5 --> 3167.52
to stay up

3164.76 --> 3168.6800000000003
yeah it's it's literally worth less than

3167.52 --> 3174.48
nothing

3168.68 --> 3178.7
less than nothing unless banks accept it

3174.48 --> 3178.7
as currency do you understand

3183.2 --> 3189.319
crypto will become The Ether which I'm

3186.78 --> 3189.3190000000004
sure it is

3192.3 --> 3197.819
less than nothing no less than nothing

3195.42 --> 3201.559
because it literally requires digital

3197.819 --> 3201.5589999999997
storing space and electricity

3201.839 --> 3205.64
for that digital storing space

3208.319 --> 3214.04
well there's literally nothing good you

3211.38 --> 3214.04
can do with it

3215.18 --> 3219.859
it takes up space costs money

3227.579 --> 3230.579
foreign

3237.44 --> 3244.619
is built in security

3240.18 --> 3246.96
no but the point is it's another form of

3244.619 --> 3250.5
currency

3246.96 --> 3253.7400000000002
without a bank

3250.5 --> 3256.38
a currency

3253.74 --> 3260.3999999999996
like that is pointless

3256.38 --> 3264.6800000000003
it's like oh look this is more secure

3260.4 --> 3264.6800000000003
who says that the bank

3268.26 --> 3274.2000000000003
and people who might use it

3271.8 --> 3276.3590000000004
because of the bank

3274.2 --> 3281.18
if the bank doesn't give it recognition

3276.359 --> 3281.18
then there's nothing you can do with it

3299.0 --> 3307.02
it would be secure after the crash

3303.359 --> 3310.2599999999998
it's only secure if it's gonna get a

3307.02 --> 3312.9
status of currency if somebody decides

3310.26 --> 3316.3190000000004
that's going to be part of

3312.9 --> 3318.2400000000002
the new banking system that decides yeah

3316.319 --> 3321.319
that crypto there yeah that's a good one

3318.24 --> 3321.319
that one

3321.359 --> 3327.48
is still like that's worth money

3325.26 --> 3329.4
yeah that is awesome oh wow it didn't

3327.48 --> 3333.839
fail yeah because you were literally

3329.4 --> 3337.319
picked and decided upon by a new bank

3333.839 --> 3342.0589999999997
that you're worth anything yeah don't

3337.319 --> 3345.24
you get it crypto is all secondary to

3342.059 --> 3349.079
Banks it's their thing

3345.24 --> 3351.2999999999997
it's their security it's their safety

3349.079 --> 3355.319
it's their way to

3351.3 --> 3357.8
Trace everything that's happened to it

3355.319 --> 3357.8
yeah

3357.9 --> 3364.28
crypto is the banks

3361.38 --> 3366.7200000000003
thing not yours

3364.28 --> 3369.3590000000004
thank you

3366.72 --> 3372.5989999999997
just like with fiat currency the afian

3369.359 --> 3375.0589999999997
currency is their little trick it's very

3372.599 --> 3378.2400000000002
convenient trick it's very usable

3375.059 --> 3380.94
people think it's our money no no that's

3378.24 --> 3385.52
that's all Bank [ __ ]

3380.94 --> 3385.52
it only works because the bank is there

3390.48 --> 3395.54
banks have no more attachment yeah

3393.0 --> 3395.54
that's right

3396.18 --> 3402.66
but without them it doesn't work

3398.819 --> 3406.2599999999998
unless you're a guild of people and it's

3402.66 --> 3408.7799999999997
like yeah we all decide we are all

3406.26 --> 3412.92
contractually binded to accept this

3408.78 --> 3415.92
crypto as as actual currency

3412.92 --> 3419.64
and then you decide

3415.92 --> 3422.46
we we will have this as a currency you

3419.64 --> 3424.6189999999997
must accept that if you're part of us

3422.46 --> 3426.599
well then you created your own

3424.619 --> 3428.52
promissory note currency among each

3426.599 --> 3430.38
other and then it's like oh this is our

3428.52 --> 3432.72
currency nobody can tell us about

3430.38 --> 3435.0
anything with it but you're still going

3432.72 --> 3437.4599999999996
to be completely dependent then on the

3435.0 --> 3439.68
overall productivity of that group that

3437.46 --> 3441.839
uses that currency because of all of

3439.68 --> 3444.359
them start dilapidating then that

3441.839 --> 3447.42
currency is worth [ __ ]

3444.359 --> 3449.5989999999997
because nobody can actually provide for

3447.42 --> 3449.599
it

3453.839 --> 3458.5789999999997
there is no easy way out it does not

3457.44 --> 3462.48
exist

3458.579 --> 3465.6800000000003
currency was only ever a representation

3462.48 --> 3465.68
of productivity

3466.319 --> 3473.7599999999998
and the rest is just the grappler tricks

3470.16 --> 3476.52
people get rich through Graveler tricks

3473.76 --> 3479.7200000000003
based on people's continued productivity

3476.52 --> 3479.72
and their trust

3482.099 --> 3486.9
and hey when things are great out there

3484.44 --> 3489.599
everybody's doing well and living well

3486.9 --> 3492.3
and getting healthy then people actually

3489.599 --> 3495.119
are very like they don't mind if

3492.3 --> 3497.7000000000003
somebody gets Rich of that

3495.119 --> 3499.619
if they're like

3497.7 --> 3501.4199999999996
yeah if everybody's happy it's like oh

3499.619 --> 3503.579
that guy can get rich yeah sure he's

3501.42 --> 3506.2200000000003
working for he wants that sure he won

3503.579 --> 3507.48
that's fine yeah nobody really has a

3506.22 --> 3510.2999999999997
problem with that it's when everybody

3507.48 --> 3513.359
gets poor that's like that guy stealing

3510.3 --> 3515.6400000000003
from us we're we can barely get by right

3513.359 --> 3518.64
you don't like to see somebody get rich

3515.64 --> 3520.859
when everybody else is getting poor

3518.64 --> 3523.98
but if everybody's like

3520.859 --> 3526.5
doing well then people don't really mind

3523.98 --> 3528.9
if somebody gets Rich it's like yeah

3526.5 --> 3530.28
it's just adding on

3528.9 --> 3532.619
you just

3530.28 --> 3534.1800000000003
he has ambition that's cool

3532.619 --> 3537.2000000000003
no problem

3534.18 --> 3537.2
see how that works

3542.4 --> 3545.599
so yeah crypto

3546.96 --> 3552.839
cryptocurrency is about as valuable as

3550.799 --> 3555.78
using seashells

3552.839 --> 3558.119
for a trade because seashells for trade

3555.78 --> 3563.96
would only work

3558.119 --> 3563.96
if a people decide it would work

3564.48 --> 3571.2
and then they trade seashells among one

3567.54 --> 3574.099
another why because they promise to

3571.2 --> 3574.0989999999997
that's why

3574.44 --> 3578.28
it's just another form of a promissory

3576.72 --> 3581.04
note

3578.28 --> 3584.42
and you can use crypto as promissory

3581.04 --> 3584.42
notes among one another

3584.7 --> 3589.799
but you can't make it a universal you

3587.64 --> 3592.2599999999998
can't make the entirety of humanity

3589.799 --> 3595.099
except a certain currency

3592.26 --> 3595.099
like that

3597.5 --> 3605.18
ironically you'd have to be a banker

3601.74 --> 3605.18
to be able to do that

3620.4 --> 3627.0
right woodworking gunny Bear yeah

3624.42 --> 3629.9
a real poop

3627.0 --> 3629.9
oh Radian

3631.5 --> 3637.44
more likely to trade for magic beans

3633.78 --> 3640.1600000000003
yeah man dude magic beans

3637.44 --> 3640.16
awesome

3640.319 --> 3644.88
I mean you can actually grow the magic

3642.839 --> 3647.339
beans now there's going to be actual

3644.88 --> 3649.44
magic out of them is another thing

3647.339 --> 3652.52
but at least it's something you can grow

3649.44 --> 3652.52
so yeah I agree

3668.7 --> 3675.5989999999997
but can you imagine some yuppie

3672.24 --> 3677.819
with a mobile going up to like a farmer

3675.599 --> 3680.2200000000003
that's like really old-fashioned and

3677.819 --> 3682.5589999999997
like I have

3680.22 --> 3685.819
like point

3682.559 --> 3688.2000000000003
five Bitcoin here and I'd really like to

3685.819 --> 3691.12
purchase like

3688.2 --> 3692.46
your product for like something like

3691.12 --> 3694.64
[Music]

3692.46 --> 3694.64
what

3694.74 --> 3699.0589999999997
so what do you have for trade I got

3696.859 --> 3701.7
Bitcoin man it's the most valuable

3699.059 --> 3704.28
currency in the world it only gets more

3701.7 --> 3709.819
value but

3704.28 --> 3709.8190000000004
yes but I mean I don't have a computer

3711.54 --> 3717.48
like I don't have anything to store it

3714.24 --> 3719.9399999999996
on oh but you can have like you can have

3717.48 --> 3722.579
online websites that'll store it for you

3719.94 --> 3726.18
yeah but I don't have any Internet to

3722.579 --> 3730.079
actually go to a website in order to do

3726.18 --> 3733.02
that and no thank you

3730.079 --> 3735.619
I'm gonna have to get something solid or

3733.02 --> 3735.619
a scale

3737.339 --> 3740.339
ah

3745.33 --> 3750.199
[Music]

3762.599 --> 3766.2200000000003
keep the yoppies away

3771.119 --> 3777.38
yeah Yuppie yeah that was a whole thing

3773.94 --> 3777.38
it's a very 90s word

3777.839 --> 3783.359
but Yuppie kind of like that went away

3781.02 --> 3787.619
and then

3783.359 --> 3790.74
well Society went completely [ __ ]

3787.619 --> 3793.7400000000002
and now it's like hipster and all that

3790.74 --> 3796.14
now hipster is the thing

3793.74 --> 3798.66
but it used to be a yuppie

3796.14 --> 3801.1189999999997
hey in a time when there was like a lot

3798.66 --> 3805.2
of prosperity still

3801.119 --> 3807.48
I mean the 90s

3805.2 --> 3810.7799999999997
computer age

3807.48 --> 3812.88
certainly lots of

3810.78 --> 3816.6600000000003
people making insane amounts of money

3812.88 --> 3819.0
because of a groundbreaking product

3816.66 --> 3821.8799999999997
in a new territory

3819.0 --> 3823.26
yeah you got yuppies

3821.88 --> 3826.099
out of that

3823.26 --> 3826.099
lots of them

3831.48 --> 3836.2400000000002
80s young urban professional huh

3841.619 --> 3849.5
yeah but the 90s too

3844.819 --> 3849.5
but it kind of died out after that

3871.76 --> 3875.5400000000004
okay Emma Peel

3895.98 --> 3898.98
foreign

3926.579 --> 3930.78
exactly dark I see and that's why we

3929.099 --> 3932.579
heard about it so much in the 90s

3930.78 --> 3935.0
because then it was like oh it's a

3932.579 --> 3935.0
yuppie

3938.7 --> 3943.799
that sounds like a prostitute

3941.7 --> 3947.46
well

3943.799 --> 3949.2599999999998
in this age it kind of is becoming that

3947.46 --> 3951.0
more and more

3949.26 --> 3954.5400000000004
so at least

3951.0 --> 3956.7
a couple earpiece I mean they're all

3954.54 --> 3958.2
freaking prostitutes man they're all

3956.7 --> 3961.2
disgusting

3958.2 --> 3961.2
foreign

3962.359 --> 3966.859
people in politics are like that

3968.7 --> 3975.68
sniffling disgusting

3972.079 --> 3975.6800000000003
groveling maggots

3975.78 --> 3979.099
way too much money

3979.799 --> 3983.119
and they never think it's enough

3984.96 --> 3990.68
they were never cool

3987.5 --> 3990.68
all right

4002.42 --> 4005.02
okay

4008.839 --> 4015.5
right but that was like very 90s like

4012.38 --> 4018.799
yuppies and all that like it all became

4015.5 --> 4020.72
arrogant in the 90s they all got special

4018.799 --> 4022.7599999999998
boy syndrome

4020.72 --> 4024.5
in the 80s it was like a new thing it's

4022.76 --> 4026.42
like wow we're changing air and then in

4024.5 --> 4031.18
the 90s like we're better than everybody

4026.42 --> 4031.1800000000003
else you're just too stupid to be rich

4045.619 --> 4047.619
um

4051.559 --> 4057.52
okay Emma Peel

4054.859 --> 4057.52
it's weird

4059.18 --> 4064.5389999999998
crypto Bros are the new yuppies

4061.88 --> 4064.539
perhaps

4067.819 --> 4072.5589999999997
but it's more like a Grappler though I

4070.52 --> 4076.5389999999998
mean crypto Bros are more like those

4072.559 --> 4076.539
stock market guys from the 80s

4076.64 --> 4083.7799999999997
right that's really what it is more like

4080.539 --> 4087.76
they're not really yuppies they're not

4083.78 --> 4087.76
because it's finances you see

4090.619 --> 4094.76
so they're more like Stock Market

4092.359 --> 4097.58
trading Bros

4094.76 --> 4099.14
from the 80s lots of people did get rich

4097.58 --> 4101.359
that way

4099.14 --> 4106.04
and that's really what the crypto [ __ ]

4101.359 --> 4109.400000000001
is it's just it's that in a new format

4106.04 --> 4112.0
only 27 really

4109.4 --> 4112.0
huh

4114.58 --> 4120.58
wow iron 26. just wow

4129.56 --> 4136.1
and I thought that I was difficult with

4132.56 --> 4139.1
the ladies dude but no you don't look

4136.1 --> 4139.1
27.

4139.759 --> 4143.799
you look like early in your 20s

4171.56 --> 4174.64
alrighty then

4177.14 --> 4179.319
foreign

4181.06 --> 4184.279
[Music]

4184.88 --> 4189.799
it seems there is going to be a flat

4187.1 --> 4192.259
Earth debates after all

4189.799 --> 4196.179
Nathan just threw out the panel link 50

4192.259 --> 4196.179
minutes ago just noticed

4196.28 --> 4200.179
so there's not going to be a three hour

4198.14 --> 4203.42
show today

4200.179 --> 4206.0

America to us is completely insane when

it comes to like food and what you allow

4492.739 --> 4497.839999999999
in it

4494.08 --> 4500.6
is like really insane

4497.84 --> 4503.659000000001
to people that know about food and and

4500.6 --> 4507.56
chemicals in Europe

4503.659 --> 4510.739
like what Americans allowed to be put in

4507.56 --> 4513.9400000000005
the food is like really like

4510.739 --> 4513.94
freaks us out

4514.159 --> 4519.08
you guys

4516.38 --> 4521.2390000000005
like can just ship out food in the

supermarkets that's so [ __ ] poison

4521.239 --> 4524.44
it's insane

4525.08 --> 4531.199
like though that those products are not

4528.26 --> 4532.6990000000005
allowed to be sold

4531.199 --> 4535.239
in Europe

4532.699 --> 4535.239
okay

4541.46 --> 4544.88
tastes like dog food well dog food is

4543.62 --> 4547.179
probably

4544.88 --> 4551.9800000000005
better

4547.179 --> 4551.9800000000005
because it has less chemicals in it

4552.62 --> 4555.679
so

4553.94 --> 4559.28
yeah

4555.679 --> 4561.5
your dog food the dog food in America is

4559.28 --> 4564.139999999999
probably better than your regular food

4561.5 --> 4566.679
because it has less chemicals in it

4564.14 --> 4566.679
yeah

4566.96 --> 4570.86
I always think about that when I see Mad

4569.0 --> 4574.76
Max 2.

4570.86 --> 4576.92
because like he like eats from a can of

4574.76 --> 4579.26
dog food

4576.92 --> 4580.88
in the scene I was thinking like yeah

4579.26 --> 4583.1
that's very sensible because it's

4580.88 --> 4584.900000000001
probably much healthier than everything

4583.1 --> 4589.6990000000005
else you're gonna find

4584.9 --> 4593.36
like dog food Twinkie dude

4589.699 --> 4597.5
you'd be better at using that Twinkie

4593.36 --> 4598.699
for like few off of a fire than to eat

4597.5 --> 4601.04
it

4598.699 --> 4602.299999999999
I'd pick the dog food every time every

4601.04 --> 4606.34

4713.739 --> 4722.299999999999
genetically modified food industry

4718.64 --> 4726.02
needs to be abolished worldwide and

those people need to be persecuted for

4726.02 --> 4731.4800000000005
crimes against humanity

4729.14 --> 4735.08

just as terrible as these [ __ ] up

4737.9 --> 4742.879999999999

4780.44 --> 4787.58
and it's like Europe is there's a weird

4783.98 --> 4791.599999999999
thing happening because one there's like

4787.58 --> 4794.3
two different growths that are happening

4791.6 --> 4796.88
so at the one hand

4794.3 --> 4799.46
it's a cloud Schwab and all that trying

4796.88 --> 4801.56
to get and it's it's a cabinets and [ __ ]

4799.46 --> 4803.659
everything up and turn it all into each

4801.56 --> 4805.280000000001
of the bugs and you can't leave your

4803.659 --> 4808.46
help

4805.28 --> 4811.46
and on the other hand there is there are

4808.46 --> 4812.4800000000005
people also part of the European

4811.46 --> 4816.14
government

4812.48 --> 4818.178999999999
that are really [ __ ] sick of this

4816.14 --> 4821.3
and that are really

4818.179 --> 4824.96
attempting to make effort to completely

4821.3 --> 4828.7390000000005
route those people to like get them out

4824.96 --> 4831.56
of the way to undo what they're doing

4828.739 --> 4835.28
to basically try to restore Europe to a

4831.56 --> 4838.9400000000005
more early model like what it used to be

4835.28 --> 4842.9
the early model where it was just a

4838.94 --> 4845.12
currency based Trade Agreement

4842.9 --> 4848.54
it was about logistics and it was about

4845.12 --> 4852.199
currency and that was great it was fine

4848.54 --> 4854.6
that that agreement that was Europe that

4852.199 --> 4856.879999999999
was really the Europe was no [ __ ]

4854.6 --> 4858.7390000000005
government involved at all

4856.88 --> 4861.08
that was great

4858.739 --> 4863.839999999999
that was just fine

4861.08 --> 4866.42
it did work for us it was very helpful

4863.84 --> 4868.6990000000005
in many ways

4866.42 --> 4873.86
and it also brought

4868.699 --> 4876.44
just more food products

4873.86 --> 4879.4
more specialized food products from over

4876.44 --> 4879.4
Europe and all that

4882.739 --> 4887.239
and that's great I mean I want the old

4885.44 --> 4889.4
Europe back

4887.239 --> 4892.239
and if not then I want the old

4889.4 --> 4892.239
Netherlands back

4894.82 --> 4901.34
and I'm not the only one I mean a lot of

4897.5 --> 4904.4
people here are like so sick of Europe

4901.34 --> 4906.860000000001
I mean it is like it's just it it starts

4904.4 --> 4909.639999999999
looking and feeling like oh it's it's

4906.86 --> 4909.639999999999
the empire

4910.159 --> 4915.98
like the emperor is trying to disband

4913.58 --> 4918.5599999999995
the Senate like that's literally what

4915.98 --> 4921.379999999999
this feels like to us it's like this is

4918.56 --> 4923.84
Europe the Senate

4921.38 --> 4926.36
all these different the giant Council

4923.84 --> 4928.46
thing remember from

4926.36 --> 4933.799999999999
the uh

4928.46 --> 4937.0
I said Star Wars five and six no wait

4933.8 --> 4937.0
two and three

4938.12 --> 4941.78
like that feels like it is all the

4940.219 --> 4945.5
European countries

4941.78 --> 4949.82
and they were all buying into this thing

4945.5 --> 4951.679
and the emperor is trying to disband the

4949.82 --> 4955.5199999999995
the Senate and that's what this feels

4951.679 --> 4960.04
like here that that's what's happening

4955.52 --> 4960.040000000001
but there's resistance plenty

4963.26 --> 4968.780000000001
so unless literally planets start

4965.6 --> 4972.860000000001
blowing up and all that [ __ ]

4968.78 --> 4974.659
like we they are not gonna win so unless

4972.86 --> 4978.04
they're gonna like start like really

4974.659 --> 4981.759999999999
trashing Europe and [ __ ] with war that

4978.04 --> 4984.08
unexpectedly happen oh yeah sure

4981.76 --> 4987.46
unexpectedly a war breaks out here in

4984.08 --> 4987.46
the middle of Europe oh yeah

4993.56 --> 4997.46
but there's still a chance to contain it

4995.9 --> 5001.239
I do feel that

4997.46 --> 5004.54
it's not too late forever

5001.239 --> 5007.0
the dark side has been bluffing a lot

5004.54 --> 5010.199
they're just flaunting it like this is

5007.0 --> 5010.199
what we're going to do with you

5010.719 --> 5015.58
to try to

5012.34 --> 5018.34
talk courage out of people

5015.58 --> 5020.14
like young people to talk courage out of

5018.34 --> 5023.92
them is like yeah we're too strong we'll

5020.14 --> 5025.4800000000005
[ __ ] you up so bad that you can't even

5023.92 --> 5028.4400000000005
come to the point where you're going to

5025.48 --> 5028.44
lay eyes on us

5029.5 --> 5034.179
bluffing their way through

5032.32 --> 5036.04
but there's plenty people that are just

5034.179 --> 5037.42
not buying it and they're realizing that

5036.04 --> 5040.8
it is a bluff and they're working

5037.42 --> 5040.8
against it and so

5043.48 --> 5047.62
because of the combined efforts and

5046.06 --> 5050.860000000001
everybody and everybody's Consciousness

5047.62 --> 5052.9
and even part of the hysteria like oh

5050.86 --> 5055.839999999999
they're all Gonna Get Us

5052.9 --> 5057.4
that too even though it's been very in

5055.84 --> 5059.8
productive in ways

5057.4 --> 5063.159
it has still been like the scar tissue

5059.8 --> 5067.62
in between that's just

5063.159 --> 5067.62
preventing it from

5068.14 --> 5073.719
from really growing out of hand

5071.08 --> 5075.5199999999995
because I I do think that it's going to

5073.719 --> 5078.64
be contained

5075.52 --> 5082.3
and if not then it's gonna be it's gonna

5078.64 --> 5085.6
be like Dresden again there yeah it's we

5082.3 --> 5088.2390000000005
contain it if [ __ ] them up

5085.6 --> 5091.900000000001
or there's going to be incinerated big

5088.239 --> 5095.04
cities in Europe once again

5091.9 --> 5095.04
that's my prediction

5095.44 --> 5101.739
you like that people you you want

5097.86 --> 5103.54
incinerated giant cities that are going

5101.739 --> 5105.28
to be firebombed and all that you want

5103.54 --> 5107.14
that

5105.28 --> 5109.9
and and you're going to blame Russia

5107.14 --> 5114.76
yeah yeah but then you're still gonna

5109.9 --> 5118.739
get incinerated though yeah

5114.76 --> 5118.7390000000005
women and children alike

5120.34 --> 5127.42
so you either have that

5122.86 --> 5130.659
or you stop these [ __ ] and you don't

5127.42 --> 5134.02
give them an inch and you

5130.659 --> 5136.12
look out for the signs and then you

5134.02 --> 5138.46
don't fall for the tricks and you don't

5136.12 --> 5141.04
fall for a dichotomy in which they

5138.46 --> 5143.88
control both sides once again like they

5141.04 --> 5143.88
continually do

5144.04 --> 5149.98
grow up or die

5148.179 --> 5155.1990000000005
yeah

5149.98 --> 5158.199
that's the scenario grow up or die

5155.199 --> 5160.12
you [ __ ] figure this out you'll

5158.199 --> 5161.259999999999
figure out these scumbags and what

5160.12 --> 5164.8
they're doing and how they're

5161.26 --> 5167.26
continually and permanently trying to

5164.8 --> 5170.08
[ __ ] you over and manipulate to get you

5167.26 --> 5173.5
on their side any way they can through

5170.08 --> 5176.5
desperation or through Glory

5173.5 --> 5178.48
grow up or die

5176.5 --> 5181.6
we figure this out

5178.48 --> 5184.419999999999
and we overcome this or we die and we

5181.6 --> 5188.02
end up with incinerated women and

5184.42 --> 5191.4400000000005
children and burnt Scorch cities

5188.02 --> 5194.159000000001
that's the choice here Europe that's the

choice we got

5194.96 --> 5198.249
[Music]

5204.699 --> 5212.5199999999995
so whatever they bring forth whatever it

5209.739 --> 5215.699
is medical oriented

5212.52 --> 5219.76
environmentally oriented War oriented

5215.699 --> 5222.5199999999995
anything oriented that comes out of this

5219.76 --> 5224.62
out of this cabal out of the media out

5222.52 --> 5228.2390000000005
of the politicians

5224.62 --> 5231.159
everything that comes out of them you do

5228.239 --> 5233.678999999999
exactly the opposite

5231.159 --> 5238.179
and doing nothing ignoring it will not

5233.679 --> 5241.5
suffice you do the opposite

5238.179 --> 5245.92
and you do it loud and you do it

5241.5 --> 5248.98
relentlessly and persistently everything

5245.92 --> 5251.9800000000005
they say you do the opposite

5248.98 --> 5251.98
consistently

5254.62 --> 5261.9
that's what you do

5256.54 --> 5261.9
or you end up with burnt cities

5262.06 --> 5267.6990000000005
and burned women and children your

5265.0 --> 5270.159
[ __ ] choice we stop this

5267.699 --> 5273.759999999999
and you [ __ ] use peer pressure people

5270.159 --> 5277.179
you [ __ ] use your peer pressure on

your peers if some [ __ ] controversial

6158.699 --> 6163.259999999999
to be fair it's kind of miraculous that

6160.92 --> 6166.86
he held out as long as he did actually

6163.26 --> 6168.719
acting like a halfway decent human being

6166.86 --> 6171.0599999999995
I mean it's been like two or three

[ __ ] delete you too because I can

6383.699 --> 6387.719
thought ahead of time that I just wanted

6385.44 --> 6390.678999999999
to leave it open

6387.719 --> 6390.679
just not

6391.38 --> 6396.6
not specifically be about anything maybe

you guys have a different idea but if

6396.6 --> 6402.0
you're gonna oh I'm just gonna say

6398.639 --> 6404.159000000001
something funny a funny title yeah well

6402.0 --> 6408.08
I don't do funny titles you might have

6404.159 --> 6408.08
noticed that I don't do funny titles

6408.42 --> 6414.06
like a little bit curious titles where

6411.06 --> 6417.6
it's like huh that's a peculiar way to

6414.06 --> 6418.8
say that why is that yeah curious not

6417.6 --> 6423.54
funny

6418.8 --> 6427.26
I don't do funny titles

6423.54 --> 6430.86
in all the 1672 shows I've done before

6427.26 --> 6433.56
this and more you should realize that by

6430.86 --> 6436.099999999999
now that in general I don't do funny

6433.56 --> 6436.1
titles

6438.06 --> 6442.679
[Music]

6440.28 --> 6444.239
like where it is actually about being

6442.679 --> 6446.84
funny

6444.239 --> 6446.839999999999
no

6453.06 --> 6457.56
they can stop trying that

6455.88 --> 6459.06
because I'm never going to accept that

6457.56 --> 6460.080000000001
title like that and it will never do

6459.06 --> 6463.820000000001
that

6460.08 --> 6463.82
I never have and I never will

6468.659 --> 6474.599999999999
right if it's a funny title it's because

6470.94 --> 6477.619
the subject is just funny and then I

6474.6 --> 6477.619000000001
presented dry

6478.02 --> 6482.219
so that a thing that is actually

6480.0 --> 6483.719
regarded as funny is just mentioned

6482.219 --> 6486.33
really serious

6483.719 --> 6489.46
that's how I do it

6486.33 --> 6489.46
[Music]

6493.5 --> 6498.36
like I make jokes

6496.08 --> 6501.179
where I present something that is

6498.36 --> 6504.36
actually funny as if it is really

6501.179 --> 6507.66
serious and normal that's my humor

6504.36 --> 6510.96
that's how I do it

6510.96 --> 6513.08
um

6515.34 --> 6521.119000000001

a [ __ ] about them

6523.44 --> 6529.339999999999
I don't care if other people think it's

6525.719 --> 6529.34
funny because they're delusional

6538.0 --> 6541.229

6542.1 --> 6546.56
God I'm appeal's still onto it

6553.02 --> 6557.159000000001

6555.119 --> 6560.4
realize there's actual women out there

6557.159 --> 6562.5599999999995
that really want to do that serious

6560.4 --> 6564.839999999999
it's like

6562.56 --> 6567.42
so

6564.84 --> 6569.1
I I don't find it as funny as it

6567.42 --> 6573.06
probably is

6569.1 --> 6576.84
because I've seen and heard

6573.06 --> 6580.88
women going on about that [ __ ] and

6576.84 --> 6580.88
actually taking it serious

6582.06 --> 6586.9800000000005
and then I had to basically stop myself

6584.4 --> 6589.04
from throwing up because it's so [ __ ]

6586.98 --> 6589.04
up

6592.56 --> 6595.1990000000005
yeah

6593.82 --> 6597.54
anyway

6595.199 --> 6601.28
I'm just gonna run out to show

6597.54 --> 6601.28
the show without a title

6601.5 --> 6606.239
maybe a title later I don't know I don't

6603.9 --> 6608.5199999999995
really care I'm just gonna try to get

6606.239 --> 6611.218999999999
better and then hopefully

6608.52 --> 6612.659000000001
I'll be just fully regenerated back to

6611.219 --> 6615.719
normal

6612.659 --> 6617.638999999999
I hope or maybe I'm not gonna be having

6615.719 --> 6621.199
a live show tomorrow I'm not getting any

6617.639 --> 6621.1990000000005
paypals recently so

6622.92 --> 6626.52
I'm not gonna call it the show without a

6625.56 --> 6629.2390000000005
title

6626.52 --> 6629.2390000000005
no

6637.619 --> 6642.719
now I'm just not gonna give it a title

6640.08 --> 6645.6
if I call it the show without a title

6642.719 --> 6649.08
then that's stupid I can never actually

6645.6 --> 6652.52
call it a show without a title blank

6649.08 --> 6655.94
because no no

6652.52 --> 6655.9400000000005
bad idea

6656.46 --> 6660.659
because I'm gonna do more shows without

6658.32 --> 6662.5199999999995
a title and I don't want to call a show

6660.659 --> 6664.199
or show without a title then because

6662.52 --> 6665.820000000001
that ruins it

6664.199 --> 6667.86
laughs

6665.82 --> 6670.86
uh

6667.86 --> 6670.86
no

6677.219 --> 6682.38
what the [ __ ] iron 26

6679.8 --> 6686.6
what the [ __ ]

6682.38 --> 6686.6
why the [ __ ] would I put that in there

6686.82 --> 6692.12
Jesus

6688.91 --> 6692.12
[Music]

6701.639 --> 6707.28
okay I got an idea actually you brought

6704.94 --> 6709.799999999999
me on to that I might mention that of

6707.28 --> 6712.5199999999995
what I said about crypto

6709.8 --> 6712.52
yep

6712.56 --> 6717.139
crypto

6714.239 --> 6717.138999999999
is out

6720.179 --> 6725.04
Bank up

6721.639 --> 6728.58
approval is less

6725.04 --> 6731.72
than worth nothing

6728.58 --> 6731.72
[Music]

6738.39 --> 6741.6
[Music]

6741.78 --> 6744.5599999999995
how about that

6745.02 --> 6750.8
crypto without bank approval is worth

6747.78 --> 6750.8
less than nothing

6754.5 --> 6757.52
what do you guys think

6784.8 --> 6790.28
and now we will all shut up [ __ ] sake

6788.04 --> 6790.28
