143.36 --> 150.709
very very sidetracked found this new

145.58 --> 154.31
channel music-oriented you might see it

150.709 --> 160.22
in on my YouTube chat or in my youtube

154.31 --> 165.17000000000002
channel it's like this guy called Davies

160.22 --> 169.18
504 and yeah the ugly Jew on D life

165.17 --> 175.19
basically shoved it in my face and just

169.18 --> 178.19
this super super funky bass guitar solo

175.19 --> 180.95
it's like really I really she ate a good

178.19 --> 184.91
guitar and I especially liked bass a lot

180.95 --> 190.22
and this guy he has a big channel man it

184.91 --> 194.15
just crazy crazy growth on that thing

190.22 --> 197.54
like over 5 million it like grows very

194.15 --> 199.85
rapidly so and his style I don't know he

197.54 --> 203.989
has a pre-recorded style with a lot of

199.85 --> 208.04
comedy and he is truly an epic bass

203.989 --> 210.89000000000001
player the bass slapper yep I've never

208.04 --> 214.07
come across him before you know I've had

210.89 --> 215.95899999999997
some other so I'm I have sup to some

214.07 --> 218.87
other like really good guitar players

215.959 --> 221.66
that are like for two O's is that it

218.87 --> 223.54
this guy is just amazing specifically

221.66 --> 230.65
with the bass and he apparently hates

223.54 --> 235.32999999999998
guitars guitars are bad but bass is ace

230.65 --> 237.19
and yeah I've just been enjoying his

235.33 --> 239.019
videos it's like so much fun it's

237.19 --> 240.64
compelling I'd really get that he has

239.019 --> 242.89000000000001
like millions of subscribers because

240.64 --> 247.319
it's it's kind of hard to step away from

242.89 --> 250.66
it's so funny and the music is so good

247.319 --> 253.92999999999998
like some of these opponents that he has

250.66 --> 255.64
basically people he caught on through

253.93 --> 258.85
Fiverr and he actually hands out money

255.64 --> 260.709
to these people to make them do that and

258.85 --> 262.93
it works I don't know where he gets the

260.709 --> 265.9
money well yes big channel it's all

262.93 --> 271.139
working apparently but it's just so much

265.9 --> 273.94
fun these guys going up to this guy man

271.139 --> 276.43
anyway yeah yeah if you'd never noticed

273.94 --> 280.51
that channel before check it out it's

276.43 --> 285.07
just so much fun and that guy's like

280.51 --> 287.65
really good at bass makes me almost want

285.07 --> 290.68
to indeed likey kind of bushes on

287.65 --> 292.78
everyone to just go out to the dirty

290.68 --> 295.26
music store and buy a bass and practice

292.78 --> 299.919
for five years and then response that

295.26 --> 302.59
yeah he's like a fanatic like open

299.919 --> 305.95
fanatic but as a joke and it's really

302.59 --> 307.5
funny huh anyway I've been watching

305.95 --> 311.639
hours of that [ __ ]

307.5 --> 316.18
yesterday night actually dreaming of it

311.639 --> 318.43
I play guitar I know but I'm I'm even

316.18 --> 325.27
bad at that I'm not good at that you

318.43 --> 327.22
know my when concerns music my vocal

325.27 --> 331.33
abilities have always been much more

327.22 --> 336.61
much better much more riding on my

331.33 --> 343.169
intuition than any other yeah external

336.61 --> 346.69
musical instrument but he certainly

343.169 --> 348.9
makes me wanna try to do that kind of

346.69 --> 348.9
[ __ ]

354.31 --> 359.84
yeah and I forwarded to my dad as well

357.86 --> 363.2
because a he's been a guitar teacher

359.84 --> 364.28
like his entire life so I'll bet he

363.2 --> 369.95
appreciates it

364.28 --> 381.55999999999995
I know and this guy just has some really

369.95 --> 387.95
funky beats like really good low Ian

381.56 --> 395.54
Adams Stacey be too deep Evan the other

387.95 --> 401.78
Klein David cope 80 all right so yeah

395.54 --> 404.66
that's what that's it mostly see it was

401.78 --> 406.98999999999995
a debates and after show that was all

404.66 --> 406.99
fine

412.31 --> 418.22
yeah we kind of talked it out the

415.4 --> 421.15999999999997
situation concerning Karen be sort off

418.22 --> 426.43
as in the war is over divorce finally

421.16 --> 428.57000000000005
over the machine stopped attacking but I

426.43 --> 429.83
don't know where it's gonna go really

428.57 --> 434.32
like you Nathan

429.83 --> 437.09
even restreamed the or rich you know

434.32 --> 440.33
peace where John got really pissed off

437.09 --> 442.42999999999995
at everyone including Karen be from

440.33 --> 446.56
Monday again in the evenings I don't

442.43 --> 451.76
know exactly why but whatever yeah

446.56 --> 454.54
then there was a bit of rent ease but it

451.76 --> 457.07
was some new guests and after that I

454.54 --> 460.76000000000005
don't know it was it went so all over

457.07 --> 467.57
the place that yeah it kind of lost my

460.76 --> 471.01
interest when I was just a bunch of

467.57 --> 471.01
yapping pretty much about anything

488.86 --> 492.47900000000004
a flattered spaceman

507.759 --> 511.499
get it Lee and who is that

531.88 --> 541.3
all right drummer well to be fair you

536.889 --> 543.3100000000001
declined I I'm not so on top of all

541.3 --> 546.399
these things that I like no the best

543.31 --> 549.5189999999999
player in a certain instrument ever I

546.399 --> 551.79
don't really keep track I just love

549.519 --> 553.899
listening to really good stuff and

551.79 --> 555.79
sometimes they'll be like oh wait it's

553.899 --> 559.389
that guy remember yeah he's freaking

555.79 --> 564.069
amazing but I don't really keep track of

559.389 --> 566.139
the names and all that I'm just really

564.069 --> 568.24
surprised that there's so many people

566.139 --> 572.11
that aren't like in big bands or

568.24 --> 573.97
anything this good it's really nice and

572.11 --> 577.029
it's cool because they can definitely

573.97 --> 580.69
just share that stuff and improvise and

577.029 --> 582.279
whatever on YouTube and everyone can

580.69 --> 590.9100000000001
enjoy it and make fun with it and

582.279 --> 590.91
everything it's just awesome yeah

596.28 --> 601.36
it's like with the Internet who really

598.96 --> 603.76
needs the music industry anymore you

601.36 --> 606.67
know because it's just out there people

603.76 --> 608.95
can just do it and share it and

606.67 --> 614.05
everybody can enjoy it and make up their

608.95 --> 618.7
own mind and not be yeah be presented

614.05 --> 620.92
with hand-picked edited things from a

618.7 --> 622.7800000000001
big industry that wants to use all it to

620.92 --> 634.12
manipulate everyone into giving them

622.78 --> 638.43
more cash so yeah and held xylophone no

634.12 --> 638.43
I don't remember that what

643.2 --> 647.8100000000001
Oh what's what's going on manda you

670.51 --> 679.31
mariusz goalie now you don't need to

674.48 --> 685.37
catch that by the way but okay sure why

679.31 --> 688.76
not I'll check him out maybe I already

685.37 --> 690.85
know him just forgot the name I don't

688.76 --> 690.85
know

692.85 --> 696.869
[Music]

704.0 --> 714.589
yeah that guy yeah he's actually also he

708.649 --> 718.699
is also a part of some of some of

714.589 --> 722.47
David's video so yeah yeah I recognize

718.699 --> 724.1289999999999
his face oh yeah he was amazing

722.47 --> 726.259
that's awesome

724.129 --> 728.089
thanks for the for the name I'll I'll

726.259 --> 732.16
just look listen to some of that

728.089 --> 732.1600000000001
sometime it's good stuff

740.26 --> 743.529
all right

753.47 --> 772.86
cool thanks please no no more I don't

770.31 --> 774.81
need a list of the hundred best guitar

772.86 --> 777.0
players in the entire world that can be

774.81 --> 781.05
found on YouTube thanks I don't have

777.0 --> 788.55
time for all that yeah thanks for that

781.05 --> 790.8199999999999
but later I'm already drowning in this

788.55 --> 790.8199999999999
[ __ ]

795.34 --> 799.039
[Music]

808.36 --> 813.759
Jesus should have known that what

810.999 --> 815.9490000000001
happened but yeah there's just thousands

813.759 --> 818.86
or a while there's at least dozens of

815.949 --> 820.809
really great musicians out there I don't

818.86 --> 823.389
want to subscribe to them all I don't

820.809 --> 829.449
want to check them out all if you don't

823.389 --> 831.639
mind maybe sometime later in their

829.449 --> 834.299
future or the this not-too-distant

831.639 --> 834.299
future at least

866.96 --> 875.01
anyway yeah other than that in flat

872.85 --> 875.82
earth world not a lot it's been

875.01 --> 878.39
happening

875.82 --> 878.3900000000001
really

881.66 --> 888.86
other than that it's leaking forward

884.84 --> 895.07
through several it's spreading out that

888.86 --> 898.7
the new realization about yeah about the

895.07 --> 903.1600000000001
Black Swan because basically is leading

898.7 --> 906.6800000000001
Globus to now as predicted start arguing

903.16 --> 910.76
for us in order to win the argument like

906.68 --> 915.92
yeah why do you assume we are assuming a

910.76 --> 918.11
geometrical curve horizon when of course

915.92 --> 919.6999999999999
it's a visual horizon well that is of

918.11 --> 923.42
course the flat earthers point in the

919.7 --> 925.19
first place and they've always did they

923.42 --> 926.3299999999999
always did actually claim it was it

925.19 --> 929.7800000000001
geometric graph and they're now

926.33 --> 931.5200000000001
certainly trying to switch it underneath

929.78 --> 935.4499999999999
our noses even though we know where to

931.52 --> 937.52
look and that is happening and people on

935.45 --> 939.71
the flatter side are taking note of this

937.52 --> 947.1999999999999
and basically if we're referencing it so

939.71 --> 947.2
that that is good I guess but see

958.17 --> 968.9
yeah that's pretty much it that that

961.02 --> 968.9
caught a lot of my time when D life

973.47 --> 978.72
don't watch anything else no

1013.73 --> 1017.26
right Swan ville

1018.43 --> 1021.51
the Black Swan

1040.22 --> 1044.699
yeah you know them yeah that's not

1042.389 --> 1047.0089999999998
really possible you know is it so

1044.699 --> 1052.919
especially because if you're looking at

1047.009 --> 1055.23
a hill it's always going to exceed the

1052.919 --> 1058.74
actual midpoint you know where the

1055.23 --> 1060.72
horizon is so it's gonna exceed it so

1058.74 --> 1063.539
there's no way because these mirages

1060.72 --> 1066.6290000000001
effects are only really in this very

1063.539 --> 1070.1589999999999
very narrow band of the visual horizon

1066.629 --> 1073.259
there's a hill over here it's always

1070.159 --> 1076.769
going to exceed it always it's just no

1073.259 --> 1078.3600000000001
other way or it would practically not be

1076.769 --> 1080.69
anywh it would be at ground level or a

1078.36 --> 1084.2099999999998
hole in the ground where a bump maybe

1080.69 --> 1087.2
but an actual hill will always be in

1084.21 --> 1091.679
front of the very very narrow horizontal

1087.2 --> 1093.96
line where if you zoom in then you might

1091.679 --> 1095.759
see all these weird little looming and

1093.96 --> 1098.58
mirages in effects but it's all gonna be

1095.759 --> 1101.249
at the horizon and yeah hey Nia zoom in

1098.58 --> 1105.509
you know enhances but you're basically

1101.249 --> 1108.029
looking at that very very narrow band of

1105.509 --> 1111.09
the real view now if there's a hill in

1108.029 --> 1113.369
between it's always going to be over it

1111.09 --> 1115.86
that's because of perspective or it

1113.369 --> 1117.029
wouldn't be a hill it would be a bump in

1115.86 --> 1120.9289999999999
a hole in the ground

1117.029 --> 1125.19
you're looking at so yeah

1120.929 --> 1129.659
a apparent horizon can never loom up

1125.19 --> 1132.21
over an actual horizon or a geometrical

1129.659 --> 1135.5900000000001
sphere edge that's yeah it's that's

1132.21 --> 1135.5900000000001
natural it is logical

1141.0 --> 1146.28
No Emperor Palpatine the whole point is

1144.21 --> 1148.71
that you can't call everything black

1146.28 --> 1151.44
swans then you miss the entire point of

1148.71 --> 1154.26
the Black Swan in the first place it's

1151.44 --> 1156.5700000000002
not about this animal is this color and

1154.26 --> 1159.6589999999999
that animal is that color no it's about

1156.57 --> 1161.52
a historical reference where originally

1159.659 --> 1163.38
was claimed that only white swans

1161.52 --> 1167.76
existed because those were around

1163.38 --> 1170.0390000000002
everywhere and then someone went out but

1167.76 --> 1172.86
made little effort to find a Black Swan

1170.039 --> 1174.84
because they are there somewhere and

1172.86 --> 1178.289
they brought with them and then yeah

1174.84 --> 1180.6589999999999
with that showing he undid the entire

1178.289 --> 1181.98
concept that only white swans existed

1180.659 --> 1185.45
that's what this is about

1181.98 --> 1188.48
not about how many black swans there are

1185.45 --> 1192.98
it's about countering the argument that

1188.48 --> 1195.6
there are only white swans which is the

1192.98 --> 1200.94
geometrical sphere edge in this case for

1195.6 --> 1206.24
the ballers and yeah if you see in a

1200.94 --> 1209.309
parent horizon much further away after

1206.24 --> 1212.7
where this geometrical sphere edge

1209.309 --> 1216.6299999999999
should be seen is obstructing things in

1212.7 --> 1219.809
a visual then that is a black swan to

1216.63 --> 1223.2600000000002
the globe and that is what what this is

1219.809 --> 1225.3899999999999
about not about all like how many black

1223.26 --> 1231.5
swans are there it's about that there

1225.39 --> 1234.7800000000002
are black swans and the pictures

1231.5 --> 1238.62
demonstrate that so the Black Swan is

1234.78 --> 1242.72
not about the animal it's about the

1238.62 --> 1242.7199999999998
original claim that there weren't any

1242.78 --> 1249.02
yeah it's common sense it's very

1245.28 --> 1249.02
baseline academics

1258.07 --> 1263.269
yeah I like that word baseline so funny

1261.679 --> 1267.289
because you can also take that in a

1263.269 --> 1270.35
musical way but the basis you know the

1267.289 --> 1275.0
basis of things the bass and the bass

1270.35 --> 1277.49
line is like the fundamental thing that

1275.0 --> 1283.19
carries everything that comes on top of

1277.49 --> 1285.909
it in the process it's funny maybe it

1283.19 --> 1289.909
was just I I was gonna find Davies like

1285.909 --> 1295.0
just the words he uses like appeal it's

1289.909 --> 1296.48
this guy has really figured out some

1295.0 --> 1300.409
what is it

1296.48 --> 1304.309
some cybernetics you really know he he

1300.409 --> 1306.169
picks he picked his words very carefully

1304.309 --> 1306.83
that he was going to use and that he was

1306.169 --> 1309.3200000000002
gonna Mimi

1306.83 --> 1311.4189999999999
picked it very carefully this guy is

1309.32 --> 1315.1689999999999
super smart where you have to be super

1311.419 --> 1317.2990000000002
smart maybe even autistic level smart to

1315.169 --> 1320.21
be that freakin good with with any

1317.299 --> 1322.279
musical instrument so he seemed kind of

1320.21 --> 1324.769
like semi artistic or maybe has

1322.279 --> 1326.659
tendencies or I don't know he is

1324.769 --> 1328.34
basically acting in all of it I don't

1326.659 --> 1332.24
know how he really is but I wouldn't be

1328.34 --> 1335.26
surprised if he had some some elements

1332.24 --> 1340.0
of it anyway

1335.26 --> 1340.0
back up to that back about eighties

1343.19 --> 1350.48
ah it's just his intro also it's just so

1347.45 --> 1355.1000000000001
funny he does constant jokes where he's

1350.48 --> 1359.05
basically declaring like oh look I am a

1355.1 --> 1364.28
pervert oh wait no I'm just base sexual

1359.05 --> 1366.3799999999999
you know that's and he really it's like

1364.28 --> 1369.17
a running gag that he's does very

1366.38 --> 1373.15
persistently and it's very he does it

1369.17 --> 1373.15
finally I think it's hilarious

1385.59 --> 1401.6789999999999
anyway sorry for distracting away from

1388.33 --> 1405.6899999999998
the Black Swan again yeah I'm stuck

1401.679 --> 1409.2
between a Black Swan and a bass player a

1405.69 --> 1409.2
bass solo

1410.89 --> 1413.939
[Music]

1433.36 --> 1439.389
hmm

1435.73 --> 1442.09
okay secret Asian man yeah well I'm not

1439.389 --> 1444.309
particularly into funk but when it comes

1442.09 --> 1449.019
to a good bass and funk yeah that's just

1444.309 --> 1453.85
super catchy the Davies has like this

1449.019 --> 1456.3990000000001
one the bass thing that he does like if

1453.85 --> 1458.35
you click on this page it's like one of

1456.399 --> 1461.35
the it's like the second video you can

1458.35 --> 1466.12
click on that that said that that video

1461.35 --> 1467.559
is the one also that the ugly Jew played

1466.12 --> 1470.85
live on the show that thing was so

1467.559 --> 1475.809
freakin funky it just like whoa dude

1470.85 --> 1479.639
like if that that kind of music would

1475.809 --> 1482.32
make my dad just go dance compulsively

1479.639 --> 1485.11
my dad used to be really a funky played

1482.32 --> 1493.11
in a funk man like with my mother by the

1485.11 --> 1493.11
way but yeah that funky music

1500.259 --> 1506.72
anyway as soon as this offer I'm

1502.159 --> 1510.0800000000002
probably gonna go back to the babies

1506.72 --> 1514.1000000000001
videos I don't know I really am into

1510.08 --> 1516.47
this guy you know it doesn't happen very

1514.1 --> 1519.4399999999998
often that I start to wonder about the

1516.47 --> 1526.519
nature of my sexuality but it might turn

1519.44 --> 1531.44
out that I'm a base sexual as well but

1526.519 --> 1536.57
yeah now just kidding but I think it's a

1531.44 --> 1539.179
really funny concept and I don't know if

1536.57 --> 1541.22
I'd go for the guitar as a hobby or

1539.179 --> 1543.5900000000001
anything I'd probably go for the bass

1541.22 --> 1546.08
I'd literally that's been in my mind

1543.59 --> 1549.649
like yeah you know what because with the

1546.08 --> 1552.83
bass it's even little things are can be

1549.649 --> 1558.379
really cool it's you can do so much with

1552.83 --> 1561.499
with very sensitive timing you can do a

1558.379 --> 1563.059
lot with the bass it doesn't have to be

1561.499 --> 1565.82
super fast or super complicated

1563.059 --> 1568.7
necessary so it is more satisfying to

1565.82 --> 1570.619
start out with that that's so yeah I had

1568.7 --> 1573.279
actually considered going for the bass

1570.619 --> 1573.279
at some point

1583.46 --> 1593.97
yeah but yeah I do it is lit yeah it's

1589.86 --> 1596.549
gonna take five years and also like even

1593.97 --> 1598.47
if I had a bass then what what I've

1596.549 --> 1600.72
gotta just practice in this frickin room

1598.47 --> 1607.169
all day that's gonna be super annoying

1600.72 --> 1609.8700000000001
for everyone although yeah technically

1607.169 --> 1612.66
one of the roommates that I do have he

1609.87 --> 1615.33
does also even do music recordings in

1612.66 --> 1618.1200000000001
his freaking room but to be fair that is

1615.33 --> 1620.01
annoying as [ __ ] to me so yeah I

1618.12 --> 1624.84
wouldn't want to do that kind of [ __ ] to

1620.01 --> 1626.8799999999999
other people and besides I would be

1624.84 --> 1629.309
starting out and that's like really

1626.88 --> 1631.38
something you don't generally want to

1629.309 --> 1638.1
share with everyone you don't want to

1631.38 --> 1640.0200000000002
share how you suck you know on the other

1638.1 --> 1643.049
hand I think that it could probably be

1640.02 --> 1647.73
figured out that you can do it with an

1643.049 --> 1650.28
electric bass of course and then do it

1647.73 --> 1652.38
with headphones so it's basically

1650.28 --> 1654.0
electrically amplified in your

1652.38 --> 1657.919
headphones and nobody else hears it

1654.0 --> 1663.03
really loud that could actually work huh

1657.919 --> 1664.6200000000001
interesting anyway whatever I'm gonna do

1663.03 --> 1669.1789999999999
with this it's gonna take a long time

1664.62 --> 1672.1789999999999
and money and blah so maybe it's just I

1669.179 --> 1675.3500000000001
think this is just a hyper little height

1672.179 --> 1678.1100000000001
because I just rolled into this you know

1675.35 --> 1680.8799999999999
I've just really into it right now

1678.11 --> 1683.36
should making rash decisions with money

1680.88 --> 1683.3600000000001
I don't have

1687.58 --> 1695.6599999999999
yes JCB and I would know because I yeah

1693.14 --> 1698.7800000000002
I come from a family where we deal with

1695.66 --> 1702.65
musicians all the freaking time we had

1698.78 --> 1705.56
and we had even like a drummer living in

1702.65 --> 1708.68
and in an extra in a separate room it's

1705.56 --> 1710.96
like a back little house separate from

1708.68 --> 1713.69
main house and he would drum practice

1710.96 --> 1717.47
there it was loud as [ __ ] that really

1713.69 --> 1719.78
disrupted so yeah we know people that

1717.47 --> 1722.09
play music it's really awesome when they

1719.78 --> 1725.29
perform at all but they have to freaking

1722.09 --> 1728.1699999999998
practice and it is so loud and [ __ ] and

1725.29 --> 1732.02
they have to do it all the time

1728.17 --> 1734.03
otherwise it doesn't really out and yeah

1732.02 --> 1737.12
who can afford to have like a soundproof

1734.03 --> 1745.75
studio you know for practicing know

1737.12 --> 1745.75
other people yeah 10,000 hours fifth

1748.48 --> 1755.68
well I've you know I do definitely

1752.87 --> 1759.4099999999999
consider my vocal cords as an instrument

1755.68 --> 1761.8400000000001
like I have yeah I've not tried anything

1759.41 --> 1764.18
said like I still have singing fears and

1761.84 --> 1769.4599999999998
all that but I know my voice I know I'm

1764.18 --> 1772.88
good and despite me smoking half of my

1769.46 --> 1774.65
life that made me fear especially at the

1772.88 --> 1777.2
beginning like oh I'm gonna lose my

1774.65 --> 1779.0300000000002
voice I'll just is it's gonna be [ __ ]

1777.2 --> 1782.81
I'm throwing away I'm trashing my own

1779.03 --> 1788.1499999999999
instrument but I don't know it's not as

1782.81 --> 1790.7
bad as I thought it would be and maybe

1788.15 --> 1792.77
it's also because I'm just more careful

1790.7 --> 1795.05
with what I smoke the type of tobacco

1792.77 --> 1797.81
that I smoke and of course use these

1795.05 --> 1803.3
specialty carbon filters now and it does

1797.81 --> 1805.85
all help make my throat less raspy no

1803.3 --> 1809.6599999999999
I'm not gonna give you a song I'll give

1805.85 --> 1812.07
you a song when I'll give you a song I'm

1809.66 --> 1819.929
not a singing performer

1812.07 --> 1823.499
I don't want to be but I can't quickly

1819.929 --> 1825.419
conjure up singing or little song memes

1823.499 --> 1828.029
out of nowhere you know I can and I do

1825.419 --> 1828.8690000000001
but it's gonna have to be magically

1828.029 --> 1837.96
natural

1828.869 --> 1841.4599999999998
I don't do requests it's gonna be

1837.96 --> 1841.46
spontaneous otherwise I'll

1846.53 --> 1853.97
you know improvisation is really where

1850.45 --> 1856.76
like is a spontaneous improvisation is

1853.97 --> 1865.1000000000001
where my talents lie is where the magic

1856.76 --> 1867.95
comes out and I'm just yeah you know I'm

1865.1 --> 1871.49
ready to talk all the time you know and

1867.95 --> 1873.97
they've shut up but just sing on request

1871.49 --> 1873.97
notice

1881.62 --> 1889.02
besides my voice you know my tone height

1885.88 --> 1892.5400000000002
is really good and I pride myself for

1889.02 --> 1895.27
like perfection when it comes to tone

1892.54 --> 1903.1299999999999
I'd yes I can and I have a very wide

1895.27 --> 1907.42
range from very low to very high but the

1903.13 --> 1910.3000000000002
tone itself of my voice isn't really a

1907.42 --> 1912.94
beautiful type of tone and that's

1910.3 --> 1917.35
something that yeah my mother also had

1912.94 --> 1921.25
this super range and precision but just

1917.35 --> 1926.4399999999998
the type of voice isn't an ideal rounded

1921.25 --> 1933.4
singing voice can be very effective for

1926.44 --> 1936.43
speaking but yeah I guess that if I had

1933.4 --> 1940.02
a more home yeah you know what that

1936.43 --> 1942.73
sounds like a really resonating it

1940.02 --> 1944.11
perfectly resonance type of voice I

1942.73 --> 1945.82
would probably be singing all the

1944.11 --> 1947.6499999999999
freaking time I couldn't help it but I

1945.82 --> 1951.07
don't know I don't really like the

1947.65 --> 1955.3300000000002
singing tone of my voice I pried the the

1951.07 --> 1959.46
heights the details that I could do but

1955.33 --> 1959.46
I just don't really like the tone of it

1959.58 --> 1965.56
I'm even surprised really that I can

1962.14 --> 1968.6190000000001
bear listening just to myself talking

1965.56 --> 1968.619
[Music]

1980.16 --> 1986.5500000000002
yes secret Asian and I know that but

1982.83 --> 1989.04
that is really if you want your tone to

1986.55 --> 1991.53
carry that's if you want to have the

1989.04 --> 1994.29
sound really projected outwards like a

1991.53 --> 1998.7
trumpet then you do it from the

1994.29 --> 2002.48
diaphragm that's true and for example

1998.7 --> 2005.66
when I speak very loudly that starts to

2002.48 --> 2009.71
happen then suddenly the the balance

2005.66 --> 2014.99
shifts goes to here and then it just

2009.71 --> 2018.47
projects forward much harder and you can

2014.99 --> 2022.43
do that with singing as well and then

2018.47 --> 2024.53
when I go softer it migrates back up and

2022.43 --> 2029.0900000000001
tends to migrate the center point

2024.53 --> 2034.78
towards my nose cavity and then you get

2029.09 --> 2034.78
the much more whispery sounds up front

2035.23 --> 2039.4
it's fascinating how that works

2066.77 --> 2076.73
now Emperor Palpatine that is total

2070.29 --> 2076.73
horseshit Swan that's Swan dumplings

2076.909 --> 2083.48
yeah the entire argument you're putting

2080.399 --> 2086.399
down that is our argument that we

2083.48 --> 2088.73
basically somewhat we didn't even

2086.399 --> 2091.5899999999997
recognize it as flat earthers at first

2088.73 --> 2097.79
but that has been our argument for some

2091.59 --> 2097.79
time now and now you're telling us that

2098.66 --> 2105.2999999999997
no it we were always will at war with

2102.42 --> 2109.08
Eastasia no we've never been at war with

2105.3 --> 2111.3900000000003
Eastasia now and then because you're

2109.08 --> 2114.109
gonna flip flop around with that

2111.39 --> 2119.609
suddenly try to do a switcheroo then

2114.109 --> 2122.39
there is no black swan now that that's

2119.609 --> 2127.59
not how it works you can't just switch

2122.39 --> 2129.71
the entire angle of approach and then

2127.59 --> 2131.88
declare that because you just

2129.71 --> 2135.08
flip-flopped on your own baseline

2131.88 --> 2137.88
argument that therefore the black swan

2135.08 --> 2141.17
doesn't exist no that's not how it works

2137.88 --> 2141.17
Emperor Palpatine sorry

2159.15 --> 2165.15
yeah you could show me where these signs

2162.269 --> 2168.1189999999997
is incorrect well how about the presumed

2165.15 --> 2170.67
are based refraction science that is not

2168.119 --> 2173.759
rather than actual scientifically

2170.67 --> 2177.119
empirical data concerning optics so

2173.759 --> 2179.549
fictional all of it how about that

2177.119 --> 2182.819
that is not scientific are based

2179.549 --> 2185.249
refraction that balls have been using to

2182.819 --> 2187.23
fantasize why it all looks like a flat

2185.249 --> 2196.73
plane right well that's not scientific

2187.23 --> 2199.44
how about that Emperor Palpatine yeah

2196.73 --> 2202.89
the Black Swan observations do

2199.44 --> 2205.109
contradict your scientism it's not

2202.89 --> 2208.019
really science it's a machination it's a

2205.109 --> 2212.46
fictional design that you all helped to

2208.019 --> 2216.5089999999996
create to make up an excuse as to how

2212.46 --> 2219.44
the supposed ball earth can look like a

2216.509 --> 2222.63
perfect flat plain at times yeah because

2219.44 --> 2226.619
there is no optics that would allow such

2222.63 --> 2229.92
a possibility that doesn't really exist

2226.619 --> 2234.96
so it had to be created from scratch so

2229.92 --> 2237.509
mutation is a fake optics to replace the

2234.96 --> 2240.66
real optics that yeah to make that

2237.509 --> 2243.48
temporary excuse for all of you as to

2240.66 --> 2247.7
why it looks like a flat plane that's

2243.48 --> 2247.7
the science that it contradicts

2252.38 --> 2260.19
because all this this crazy idiotic

2256.85 --> 2264.0899999999997
nonsensical looming idea right that

2260.19 --> 2266.42
doesn't work that's not how the optics

2264.09 --> 2269.3
really work it can't work

2266.42 --> 2273.09
you can't have an apparent horizon

2269.3 --> 2277.8300000000004
looming above a geometrical horizon

2273.09 --> 2280.26
which is there geometrically physically

2277.83 --> 2283.74
there according to the globe

2280.26 --> 2288.3
you can't just swerve around you can't

2283.74 --> 2291.1499999999996
just bypass that ballers and propel

2288.3 --> 2295.94
Putin you can't just pretend like it's

2291.15 --> 2299.55
not there no there is a literal physical

2295.94 --> 2302.2200000000003
geometrical curve according to your

2299.55 --> 2306.42
model that you believe is reality and

2302.22 --> 2308.43
you're standing on it you're standing on

2306.42 --> 2310.32
the edge of that curve and when you look

2308.43 --> 2314.1299999999997
down because you actually have to look

2310.32 --> 2318.9
down somewhat you would be looking at

2314.13 --> 2320.9700000000003
the edge of a curve and that curve right

2318.9 --> 2323.25
would have to be according to very

2320.97 --> 2326.16
specific geometry that has been pre

2323.25 --> 2328.8
calculated because the radius of Earth

2326.16 --> 2332.16
is determined according to the

2328.8 --> 2335.7000000000003
heliocentric ball Earth's system so that

2332.16 --> 2339.27
curve can not be flexible it can only be

2335.7 --> 2343.7999999999997
in one way and if it turns out that

2339.27 --> 2345.9
reality it is or it seems flexible then

2343.8 --> 2348.54
a conceptualization that it is that

2345.9 --> 2354.75
sphere size is just wrong because optics

2348.54 --> 2356.64
don't work that way optics can't bend a

2354.75 --> 2358.86
sphere into a flat plane that's

2356.64 --> 2360.9
physically impossible there's no

2358.86 --> 2364.73
empirical evidence that that can be done

2360.9 --> 2369.27
in any scale in any set up ever

2364.73 --> 2374.16
it doesn't even bend light in a

2369.27 --> 2377.55
direction that can't even happen it's

2374.16 --> 2380.22
it's got to deviate the angle it's not

2377.55 --> 2383.19
gonna bend it around there's nothing

2380.22 --> 2385.9199999999996
that's that can in a single medium

2383.19 --> 2388.44
and light around in a corner it's not

2385.92 --> 2392.579
gonna follow the parallel of the medium

2388.44 --> 2394.65
it can never happen ever so it doesn't

2392.579 --> 2397.5
matter what different density layers are

2394.65 --> 2401.2200000000003
supposedly overlaying one another light

2397.5 --> 2405.079
can never travel parallel within one

2401.22 --> 2409.64
layer that's never gonna happen ever

2405.079 --> 2409.6400000000003
that's not how optics work

2415.42 --> 2418.57
[Music]

2427.36 --> 2430.56
Oh James Mason

2433.27 --> 2436.369
[Music]

2439.16 --> 2443.94
[Music]

2452.74 --> 2459.04
oh oh yeah yeah I'm propel Pettine

2457.18 --> 2462.5699999999997
that's right yeah there was some

2459.04 --> 2466.06
distortion there was definitely some

2462.57 --> 2467.8900000000003
refraction visible that's right there

2466.06 --> 2469.39
was refraction visible on the currents

2467.89 --> 2474.64
they were somewhat distorted you know

2469.39 --> 2477.67
why because they were very far away very

2474.64 --> 2480.1299999999997
far away that's right and when things

2477.67 --> 2482.53
get very far away then eventually they

2480.13 --> 2484.69
might start to blur a little there and

2482.53 --> 2487.0
then when they get even further away

2484.69 --> 2488.8
they can blur out so bad that you

2487.0 --> 2491.14
literally see a gray soup and that's

2488.8 --> 2492.55
gonna be or anything beyond that point

2491.14 --> 2494.47
is not gonna be visible anymore it's

2492.55 --> 2497.23
just gonna be a blurred out soup it's

2494.47 --> 2501.0989999999997
gonna be homogeneous soup but you're

2497.23 --> 2503.5
staring at beyond that point but here's

2501.099 --> 2509.099
the thing that little blurry thingy

2503.5 --> 2513.79
right that cannot be all looming up

2509.099 --> 2519.3900000000003
behind a geometrical curve like up from

2513.79 --> 2523.66
behind it that doesn't work a image can

2519.39 --> 2525.3689999999997
uniformly be loomed up but then parts of

2523.66 --> 2530.71
that image you're not gonna separately

2525.369 --> 2532.54
blur that's not how that works so even

2530.71 --> 2535.83
that there is some local blurring

2532.54 --> 2540.19
happening there means that it's

2535.83 --> 2542.02
physically literally there it's not

2540.19 --> 2544.0
somewhere else it's not an image loom

2542.02 --> 2545.859
that it's actually physically there

2544.0 --> 2548.05
because there is local blurring

2545.859 --> 2550.74
happening and that doesn't happen two

2548.05 --> 2553.8100000000004
images that are being loomed up from a

2550.74 --> 2557.6189999999997
literal other location visible in the

2553.81 --> 2561.0099999999998
location they are not at the little

2557.619 --> 2563.29
local blurring is local distortion that

2561.01 --> 2565.21
means that what you're looking at it

2563.29 --> 2569.73
that is being inserted is literally

2565.21 --> 2572.73
there and not as part of a loomed image

2569.73 --> 2572.73
okay

2576.42 --> 2581.46
yeah think about that ballers

2581.91 --> 2585.0299999999997
[Music]

2604.06 --> 2611.38
what are you serious I've already

2609.04 --> 2617.59
explained it so many times why do I have

2611.38 --> 2620.1
to keep on repeating myself is this just

2617.59 --> 2620.1000000000004
some troll

2622.05 --> 2631.4300000000003
I think it is a troll I think I'm just

2627.81 --> 2631.43
annoying individual

2655.63 --> 2663.309
oh really how much of the oil rigs were

2658.029 --> 2666.279
obstructed then was all of it obstructed

2663.309 --> 2670.63
could you see any of it or could you see

2666.279 --> 2672.549
nothing of it because I don't know you

2670.63 --> 2674.44
know there's this issue about with these

2672.549 --> 2678.13
oil rigs and the visibility and all that

2674.44 --> 2681.16
and hey if one day you can see pretty

2678.13 --> 2684.4590000000003
much all of it and the other day you can

2681.16 --> 2686.199
only see the upper half of it from the

2684.459 --> 2692.459
platform on or something like that and

2686.199 --> 2694.719
the recipe would be concealed right well

2692.459 --> 2698.109
that's still gonna be a problem because

2694.719 --> 2702.2490000000003
the original footage was taken at a very

2698.109 --> 2704.859
low height at extreme distances so it

2702.249 --> 2708.759
doesn't really matter if it's all

2704.859 --> 2714.009
visible or not none of it should be

2708.759 --> 2717.209
visible ever from that height and you

2714.009 --> 2720.759
know you you can't argue against that

2717.209 --> 2724.089
except by your fantastical machination

2720.759 --> 2728.16
of this crazy fictional are based

2724.089 --> 2731.38
looming that doesn't actually exist

2728.16 --> 2735.0989999999997
because it doesn't matter if the base of

2731.38 --> 2739.15
the oil rigs would be covered or not

2735.099 --> 2741.039
visible you shouldn't see any of it

2739.15 --> 2746.17
because the observer height was

2741.039 --> 2747.849
incredibly low Emperor Palpatine it

2746.17 --> 2749.949
doesn't matter what the freakin

2747.849 --> 2754.199
refraction conditions are it should

2749.949 --> 2756.819
never be visible ever and because it is

2754.199 --> 2759.4300000000003
it's just doesn't matter you're just

2756.819 --> 2762.249
gonna twirl around it all the time

2759.43 --> 2764.3799999999997
it shouldn't be visible ever it should

2762.249 --> 2768.43
be completely concealed because the

2764.38 --> 2772.089
observer height is absurdly low it

2768.43 --> 2775.9489999999996
should be never visible yet it is you

2772.089 --> 2775.949
know why because the earth is flat

2785.88 --> 2788.989
[Music]

2792.17 --> 2797.32
now it doesn't depend on the height of

2794.42 --> 2800.83
the object it doesn't depend on anything

2797.32 --> 2803.54
else than the freaking observer height

2800.83 --> 2808.37
and the observer height is really low

2803.54 --> 2810.89
and it doesn't matter how big anything

2808.37 --> 2814.49
is in the distance it doesn't matter it

2810.89 --> 2818.2
should not be visible the observer I did

2814.49 --> 2821.95
low enough you should almost see nothing

2818.2 --> 2825.71
nothing because you're staring at a

2821.95 --> 2827.66
sphere right well that means that

2825.71 --> 2830.4700000000003
anything close by is gonna obscure

2827.66 --> 2834.5
everything else and it's all gonna be

2830.47 --> 2838.5499999999997
exponentially getting worse so anything

2834.5 --> 2841.85
is minutely sized in the front is just

2838.55 --> 2843.65
gonna cover up everything everything in

2841.85 --> 2846.02
the back doesn't matter how big it is

2843.65 --> 2848.0
because it's all angled away anyway and

2846.02 --> 2852.08
getting smaller through perspective you

2848.0 --> 2853.03
shouldn't see anything ever at that

2852.08 --> 2857.65
height

2853.03 --> 2860.75
nothing nothing you should not even know

2857.65 --> 2863.87
have any kind of realization that from

2860.75 --> 2865.91
that point you could ever actually see

2863.87 --> 2873.65
any oil rates that should never be

2865.91 --> 2878.0299999999997
possible yet it is I don't care you

2873.65 --> 2881.14
knatoms I don't care what is it's just a

2878.03 --> 2881.1400000000003
baller he's been in there before

2891.25 --> 2897.17
yeah that's called shoaling that's

2894.98 --> 2899.2400000000002
actual physical obstruction from a body

2897.17 --> 2901.309
of water that's moved up at a higher

2899.24 --> 2905.68
height than the rest of the ocean

2901.309 --> 2905.6800000000003
because it's being pushed land upward

2919.51 --> 2926.9500000000003
right well Julia Pavan look they can

2922.3 --> 2930.07
claim any shoaling maybe some kind of

2926.95 --> 2932.41
curve but it's not persistent right and

2930.07 --> 2934.869
it can actually be measured physically

2932.41 --> 2937.48
to be there that there is a difference

2934.869 --> 2941.08
in water height okay it's a registered

2937.48 --> 2946.06
thing grantees figure that out it's like

2941.08 --> 2947.5
official thing that happens so doesn't

2946.06 --> 2951.04
matter if dollars are gonna claim that

2947.5 --> 2953.98
is the the sign of the curve revealing

2951.04 --> 2956.71
itself but that's just nonsense the

2953.98 --> 2959.14
curve should not be revealing itself it

2956.71 --> 2962.41
should literally always be there and

2959.14 --> 2966.04
only in miraculous conditions should it

2962.41 --> 2972.3399999999997
not appear to be there because it is

2966.04 --> 2974.79
supposed reality it's not it's the

2972.34 --> 2974.79
exception

2977.34 --> 2981.54
because you can just see very far if

2979.53 --> 2985.2000000000003
there's enough air clarity you can just

2981.54 --> 2988.35
see very far and that means less

2985.2 --> 2991.5899999999997
refraction less refraction means less

2988.35 --> 2994.35
disruption less distortion less Mirage

2991.59 --> 2999.3900000000003
in distortion effects which means more

2994.35 --> 3004.4
as is so clear air further visibility

2999.39 --> 3007.72
more as is how much more blatant do you

3004.4 --> 3007.7200000000003
need to get people

3018.96 --> 3025.2400000000002
now Emperor Palpatine I'm not claiming

3022.18 --> 3032.14
anything I'm literally explaining this

3025.24 --> 3034.74
word by word mechanic by mechanic if I

3032.14 --> 3037.17
hear a remark like that from you again

3034.74 --> 3043.1189999999997
you're banned

3037.17 --> 3044.289
don't you dare strawman [ __ ] that stuff

3043.119 --> 3048.039
in my boots

3044.289 --> 3051.73
ever I literally explain everything in

3048.039 --> 3055.9300000000003
detail right now so don't you dare put

3051.73 --> 3058.589
that [ __ ] in my mouth or you're banned

3055.93 --> 3058.589
got that

3061.16 --> 3064.3399999999997
[Music]

3069.27 --> 3075.27
cite the claims what the hell is wrong

3072.21 --> 3077.78
with you the claims are there it's a

3075.27 --> 3080.19
sphere right Emperor Palpatine a

3077.78 --> 3083.4
geometrical sphere well that has

3080.19 --> 3086.07
geometrical consequences then I don't

3083.4 --> 3088.11
have to freaking cite anything what I

3086.07 --> 3091.02
have to cite I get the point

3088.11 --> 3093.6
out there who officially declares that a

3091.02 --> 3096.47
sphere is a sphere and has geometrical

3093.6 --> 3100.5499999999997
consequences are you insane

3096.47 --> 3100.5499999999997
get a freaking life buddy

3103.91 --> 3107.0
[Music]

3111.95 --> 3115.02
[Music]

3134.809 --> 3139.759
right okay that's fine science works in

3138.079 --> 3145.7290000000003
mysterious ways for maybe you should

3139.759 --> 3149.299
just shut the hell up and actually do

3145.729 --> 3152.779
some reading and listening before you

3149.299 --> 3154.64
start to say things based on conclusions

3152.779 --> 3157.209
that you clearly don't know about

3154.64 --> 3163.489
because you haven't looked into it yet

3157.209 --> 3167.5389999999998
know that how that works it's like oh

3163.489 --> 3172.339
let's look somewhere okay look at it two

3167.539 --> 3175.6400000000003
minutes oh I'm hearing something I don't

3172.339 --> 3177.859
know let's ask some random questions

3175.64 --> 3180.229
even though I have literally no idea

3177.859 --> 3182.39
what the guy's been saying so far or

3180.229 --> 3185.419
what he even talks about that makes

3182.39 --> 3188.839
sense right to then already pre draw

3185.419 --> 3190.669
conclusions and just blurt that out no

3188.839 --> 3194.689
that just really dumb

3190.669 --> 3195.979
and short side and the antisocial

3194.689 --> 3197.989
behavior as well

3195.979 --> 3202.729
no you just why don't you actually

3197.989 --> 3207.459
listen to what I have to say before you

3202.729 --> 3207.459
start drawing conclusions then

3213.54 --> 3218.64
yeah you're banned piss off

3228.51 --> 3236.46
no they're not misusing the term black

3231.45 --> 3244.5899999999997
zone you're banned as well I'm sick of

3236.46 --> 3246.63
you people you people are [ __ ] go go

3244.59 --> 3248.82
spiral out of control somewhere else

3246.63 --> 3250.8
just go to discord go to gems and just

3248.82 --> 3252.27
spiral like a bunch of demons to start

3250.8 --> 3259.77
clawing your eyes out

3252.27 --> 3263.52
freakin retards Black Swan is here to

3259.77 --> 3265.59
stay and it works and we're right and if

3263.52 --> 3268.4
you're too dumb to deal with it then

3265.59 --> 3268.4
piss off

3285.72 --> 3289.95
yeah and it doesn't mean that hey

3288.24 --> 3293.2799999999997
everybody on the Flat Earth site is

3289.95 --> 3297.18
gonna get the argument because yeah it

3293.28 --> 3301.32
is kind of academic it is not where

3297.18 --> 3304.41
people are used to looking and laying

3301.32 --> 3306.78
the emphasis on that's not the black so

3304.41 --> 3308.97
on the Black Swan is not something that

3306.78 --> 3312.09
flat earthers are used to laying the

3308.97 --> 3313.74
emphasis on in arguments so there's

3312.09 --> 3320.2200000000003
going to be a lot of misconceptions with

3313.74 --> 3323.43
that okay but that yeah that doesn't

3320.22 --> 3326.3999999999996
mean that it's wrong it's very right and

3323.43 --> 3330.33
it is at the core even in a way you

3326.4 --> 3334.11
could say as how most flat earthers have

3330.33 --> 3337.56
started out trying to argue against the

3334.11 --> 3341.6400000000003
globe they just didn't know that it's

3337.56 --> 3344.22
basically called the Black Swan that it

3341.64 --> 3345.69
has historical references that's the

3344.22 --> 3348.66
thing see so it's just basically

3345.69 --> 3351.12
updating the academics what feathers

3348.66 --> 3357.7999999999997
have already been doing just putting a

3351.12 --> 3357.7999999999997
name and a history to it see

3363.61 --> 3369.23
right indeed yeah I really like that

3366.29 --> 3370.0299999999997
Nathan Thompson said that that was

3369.23 --> 3373.85
excellent

3370.03 --> 3378.92
you don't go to a vampire website and

3373.85 --> 3381.2
tried to debunk vampires exist like is

3378.92 --> 3385.78
there giant hoards of people doing that

3381.2 --> 3388.7599999999998
I don't think so

3385.78 --> 3390.6200000000003
there might be a couple of Christians

3388.76 --> 3393.11
that get rowdy and then go they're also

3390.62 --> 3395.95
against God as early yeah that kind of

3393.11 --> 3398.84
thing maybe but they wouldn't try to

3395.95 --> 3403.46
explain to those people that it's not

3398.84 --> 3405.32
real that that wouldn't be the angle to

3403.46 --> 3408.29
it it wouldn't really care about what

3405.32 --> 3410.3
they thought and yet with flat earth all

3408.29 --> 3413.81
these ballers seems to get obsessed with

3410.3 --> 3416.42
us thinking about Flat Earth that it's

3413.81 --> 3419.84
wrong and we we shouldn't think that we

3416.42 --> 3423.05
should be changed to think like they do

3419.84 --> 3426.31
and that is very unusual that doesn't

3423.05 --> 3426.3100000000004
happen with a lot of other things

3447.39 --> 3454.02
so yeah Carol be right away I I think

3452.37 --> 3455.7
well I don't want to take too much

3454.02 --> 3459.33
credit but I think I took care of the

3455.7 --> 3470.33
situation a little got janta basically

3459.33 --> 3470.33
and the war so that's over but yeah

3470.81 --> 3474.5299999999997
it's not gonna be completely over

3472.82 --> 3478.15
because I think John is just really out

3474.53 --> 3478.15
looking for trouble at this point

3481.77 --> 3491.52
yeah the machine war Karen B yeah you

3490.05 --> 3493.02
missed it because you don't watch the

3491.52 --> 3495.78
flat earth debates and you don't watch

3493.02 --> 3498.41
ball busters and that was basically the

3495.78 --> 3500.9100000000003
baseline of my argument in your defense

3498.41 --> 3506.45
in the situation I didn't I know you

3500.91 --> 3510.0899999999997
don't keep track that's fine I do and

3506.45 --> 3512.1
he's been declaring war on flat earth

3510.09 --> 3516.57
does that get things wrong it's were

3512.1 --> 3522.0
especially etherealists ether Asst so

3516.57 --> 3523.98
yeah that's that's what that is and I

3522.0 --> 3527.64
kind of made him stop by just telling

3523.98 --> 3531.56
him like no she just didn't really care

3527.64 --> 3534.1189999999997
for this show and she hasn't been fully

3531.56 --> 3535.95
made conscious because of constant

3534.119 --> 3537.81
repetition of the Black Swan what it is

3535.95 --> 3540.24
in technicals blah blah blah so she just

3537.81 --> 3544.16
overlooked it and she didn't really care

3540.24 --> 3550.9199999999996
and now so the yeah the war has been

3544.16 --> 3555.5099999999998
retracted before it really got ugly yeah

3550.92 --> 3558.4700000000003
I know he's on a crusade fathered a son

3555.51 --> 3558.4700000000003
in the holy sword

3579.39 --> 3587.0099999999998
well Ellie be an embarrassment maybe

3582.06 --> 3589.13
he's a mixed bag and yeah I'll bet you

3587.01 --> 3593.4900000000002
hate him I bet you hate his guts

3589.13 --> 3595.5
everything he says I bet it there's

3593.49 --> 3597.3599999999997
things about him that I can't stand but

3595.5 --> 3601.2
and the other hand he does have certain

3597.36 --> 3603.81
types a level of information I don't

3601.2 --> 3609.0
think everybody can even see that it's

3603.81 --> 3611.52
quite valuable to me so yeah that gives

3609.0 --> 3614.82
me reason enough to the one who tolerate

3611.52 --> 3618.48
him and I think that might be mutual by

3614.82 --> 3621.09
the way cuz yeah I you know I know him

3618.48 --> 3622.68
to no end but he deal it still does make

3621.09 --> 3627.36
effort to make things right again

3622.68 --> 3629.5699999999997
afterwards so it's just it is what it is

3627.36 --> 3629.57
man

3647.13 --> 3656.7290000000003
Oh Ellie bees a bit dramatic there look

3653.13 --> 3659.869
hey diesel just an answer love you know

3656.729 --> 3659.8689999999997
that's how I see it

3665.38 --> 3669.009
somebody hates that means that they

3667.209 --> 3672.8689999999997
can't connect in some way and get

3669.009 --> 3672.869
frustrated and then things turn to hate

3695.589 --> 3701.259
yeah bill G yeah I'm glad I'm glad that

3698.559 --> 3704.7090000000003
happened that that basically nobody Jim

3701.259 --> 3707.499
that Nathan didn't go with John in that

3704.709 --> 3710.1699999999996
that he actually sided with me very

3707.499 --> 3712.509
happy about that it's a relief because I

3710.17 --> 3715.9300000000003
didn't want that's to start and

3712.509 --> 3719.14
happening you know it's set enough

3715.93 --> 3729.249
messiness with the ballers as it is we

3719.14 --> 3731.41
don't need infighting and I also think

3729.249 --> 3735.279
that that John should really try to find

3731.41 --> 3739.029
a way to assert criticism on

3735.279 --> 3741.519
flat-earthers without declaring war you

3739.029 --> 3743.289
know there can be better ways to do this

3741.519 --> 3746.9489999999996
he just needs to find the freakin

3743.289 --> 3750.369
patience and some self-discipline to to

3746.949 --> 3752.469
achieve that if that's ever possible I

3750.369 --> 3755.4100000000003
don't know anyway I'm gonna run out the

3752.469 --> 3757.779
