so yeah

120.399 --> 124.159

126.3 --> 131.119
[Music]

127.759 --> 131.119
at least i stay dry

132.08 --> 135.28
right

133.44 --> 138.48
so yeah it's not the most pleasant of

135.28 --> 138.48
weathers outside but

139.76 --> 143.0
oh well

144.56 --> 148.4
hello

146.319 --> 151.04
crockett first in chat good to see you

148.4 --> 151.04
kevlar

152.16 --> 158.2
it is friday the 4th of february 2022

159.44 --> 166.239
and i'll be doing a

162.16 --> 168.319
full show and going also past three

166.239 --> 172.48000000000002
because nathan is yeah i don't think

168.319 --> 176.39999999999998
he's gonna do a show again today he's

172.48 --> 176.39999999999998
he's still having issues with the jaw

179.12 --> 182.56
so

181.04 --> 185.2
yeah

182.56 --> 186.239
hopefully it'll all be kind of stable

185.2 --> 188.56
and

186.239 --> 190.8
you know that monday so he'll just be

188.56 --> 195.04
able to do flat earth debates again but

190.8 --> 195.04000000000002
yeah he definitely needs some healing

196.84 --> 199.599
time because

198.8 --> 201.36
yeah

199.599 --> 203.35999999999999
from what i got

201.36 --> 205.04000000000002
the wound he

203.36 --> 206.64000000000001
accidentally

205.04 --> 208.879
attained

206.64 --> 210.23899999999998
on this jaw was pretty

208.879 --> 213.67999999999998
pretty bad

210.239 --> 216.0
it's not like bone shattering bad but

213.68 --> 216.0
still

216.159 --> 220.79899999999998
it was bad enough that it's yeah it's

218.799 --> 221.84
not just a scratch on the surface or

220.799 --> 225.84
anything

221.84 --> 228.959
right so yeah speedy recovery nathan

225.84 --> 228.959
get well soon

229.28 --> 232.879
and take it easy until then

233.439 --> 238.35999999999999
right

235.12 --> 238.36
so yeah

240.64 --> 242.95899999999997
right

253.599 --> 257.76
yeah yesterday's show was overall pretty

255.519 --> 257.76
good

258.4 --> 263.44
it's only at the the last

260.799 --> 265.52
few moments really that yeah it got

263.44 --> 268.52
zerked by trolls and i got pissed off

265.52 --> 268.52
again

269.12 --> 271.36
uh

276.4 --> 279.28
but

277.36 --> 280.96000000000004
yeah what i was even talking about

279.28 --> 283.84
yesterday

280.96 --> 283.84
i don't remember

292.56 --> 294.96
anyway

295.36 --> 301.91900000000004
sean hawkins apparently made it

298.32 --> 301.919
another video about me

302.32 --> 307.759
because i did absolutely identify him

305.6 --> 311.84000000000003
immediately in the chat yesterday when

307.759 --> 311.84000000000003
he popped in with his sock account

312.72 --> 317.52000000000004
and i guess that triggered him to make

314.639 --> 317.52
another video

318.32 --> 322.08
i think it i haven't actually watched it

320.96 --> 325.28
but

322.08 --> 327.19899999999996
i think it's about well the polaris

325.28 --> 328.479
challenge of course

327.199 --> 330.32
what else

328.479 --> 332.56
but also that he thought it was

330.32 --> 334.56
ridiculous that i

332.56 --> 335.919
i set that challenge

334.56 --> 339.12
right

335.919 --> 342.08
flat earth versus globe earth sextant

339.12 --> 344.0
navigation challenge

342.08 --> 346.4
so he thought that was ridiculous if

344.0 --> 346.4
anything

349.52 --> 353.79999999999995
i still think it's a fun idea

357.36 --> 363.33000000000004
just don't do it in the stormy season

360.28 --> 363.33
[Music]

363.68 --> 366.68
anyway

374.15 --> 377.37
[Music]

388.96 --> 391.12
yeah

390.4 --> 393.59999999999997
yeah

391.12 --> 396.72
really when the letter of debates is not

393.6 --> 396.72
life it does really like

397.199 --> 402.8
cut a big hole out of the day for me

400.24 --> 405.36
especially because afterward i

402.8 --> 407.68
i'm used to hanging around with the guys

405.36 --> 410.56
after recording even stops

407.68 --> 413.28000000000003
i always have very good conversation

410.56 --> 416.16
conversations

413.28 --> 416.15999999999997
and i miss that

416.479 --> 420.039
hey tony whitcomb

422.639 --> 425.599
it's a narcissist

425.68 --> 429.96
could be

426.72 --> 429.96000000000004
could be

440.479 --> 444.4
what's the topic or is it open day it is

442.8 --> 446.88
pretty much open day there's not going

444.4 --> 450.63899999999995
to be a live letter of debates

446.88 --> 452.479
so i can keep going

450.639 --> 454.16
i was planning to that's why i did

452.479 --> 458.24
groceries before

454.16 --> 460.72
the show also part of why i'm late

458.24 --> 463.12
so usually when i find out nathan is not

460.72 --> 464.72
doing a live show i'm gonna take it easy

463.12 --> 467.28000000000003
a bit

464.72 --> 469.68
usually start later and then just keep

467.28 --> 469.67999999999995
going

470.24 --> 474.40000000000003
right because there's no more necessity

472.24 --> 479.56
to really make it

474.4 --> 479.56
lock in with the flatter debate start

481.52 --> 486.31899999999996
then i get to scoop up some of the

484.16 --> 488.879
people that were expecting a live show

486.319 --> 491.759
and then are just like oh it's not live

488.879 --> 493.12
okay oh wait flat earth early bird still

491.759 --> 496.40000000000003
live

493.12 --> 498.639
right so yeah that's just what i'm doing

496.4 --> 500.479
every time nathan doesn't

498.639 --> 502.72
or announces that he isn't doing a live

500.479 --> 502.71999999999997
show

504.879 --> 509.03900000000004
didn't get a notification

506.8 --> 512.039
weird

509.039 --> 512.039
hmm

525.76 --> 531.6
right so yeah i'm pretty much open topic

529.2 --> 532.72
there it has yeah i was actually

531.6 --> 535.839
watching

532.72 --> 535.839
a flat water video

536.64 --> 539.04
flat water effie

538.64 --> 540.48
from

539.04 --> 543.5999999999999
[Music]

540.48 --> 543.6
today this morning

544.16 --> 546.64
i got

546.839 --> 554.6400000000001
about magellan and another what is it

550.64 --> 557.6
bigger vettes journeys

554.64 --> 560.08
like around the world supposedly but

557.6 --> 561.76
yeah considering what they bumped into

560.08 --> 564.08
in

561.76 --> 567.2
america when they tried to get past

564.08 --> 570.1600000000001
the southern tip of that

567.2 --> 572.32
and yeah all these peoples they met they

570.16 --> 575.04
met there and there were many different

572.32 --> 577.9200000000001
like so many different tribes that were

575.04 --> 581.36
like very different looking even

577.92 --> 582.8
and yeah giants like really really

581.36 --> 585.76
upskilled

582.8 --> 587.76
big humans

585.76 --> 590.08
they were like up to twice the size of

587.76 --> 594.24
the regular

590.08 --> 594.24
person that well came from portugal

594.48 --> 599.6800000000001
so it's always very interesting because

596.959 --> 602.0
they there have been they made journals

599.68 --> 604.0
and they made so much detailed

602.0 --> 605.44
notifications

604.0 --> 607.839
and that's like

605.44 --> 612.0790000000001
that makes it like very valuable because

607.839 --> 612.0790000000001
it's like raw data it's just like

612.16 --> 618.0
a person was there

614.16 --> 620.56
sized it up and just made notes

618.0 --> 621.839
like if you just ran yeah if you're just

620.56 --> 623.68
trying to look for something

621.839 --> 625.36
entertaining it's just kind of weird and

623.68 --> 627.04
random but

625.36 --> 628.64
if you really take into account that

627.04 --> 630.3199999999999
it's actually a

628.64 --> 632.8
live encounter

630.32 --> 636.0
from that time that gives a picture of

632.8 --> 638.3199999999999
what was going on down there

636.0 --> 641.44
in that time period then it's like

638.32 --> 644.32
really valuable data because it's like

641.44 --> 646.5600000000001
well pretty much the only data

644.32 --> 649.519
after that

646.56 --> 651.04
the colonialists pretty much moved in

649.519 --> 654.8
and just

651.04 --> 654.8
like ravaged the place

654.959 --> 660.279
so all of these testimonies are kind of

657.279 --> 660.279
lost

660.88 --> 665.36
i mean like the peoples

662.8 --> 667.3599999999999
that were tested yeah that were

665.36 --> 670.16
being

667.36 --> 672.32
analyzed and written about they were

670.16 --> 676.8
yeah they're all gone they're all kind

672.32 --> 678.399
of dead in wars and [ __ ] or they left it

676.8 --> 681.1999999999999
i don't know some of it's still mystery

678.399 --> 684.8
but it's yeah very interesting

681.2 --> 684.8000000000001
videos from flat water

685.44 --> 688.7600000000001
or not

693.12 --> 697.519
i'll link it up

695.44 --> 700.8800000000001
it's like it's done many of these types

697.519 --> 703.839
of videos i think it just keeps

700.88 --> 703.8389999999999
rehashing it

704.64 --> 708.48
he had a lot of trouble flat water that

706.8 --> 710.399
guy had a lot of trouble with like his

708.48 --> 713.12
recording

710.399 --> 714.639
in the earlier years

713.12 --> 717.6
i think he's just kind of like

714.639 --> 721.12
re-recording it re-reading it

717.6 --> 723.6800000000001
and just trying to do it perfect now

721.12 --> 725.68
which is very much worth it

723.68 --> 726.88
because he is a good

725.68 --> 729.88
narrator

726.88 --> 729.88
anyway

733.2 --> 736.48
hello carolyn a

743.6 --> 745.839
right

764.16 --> 768.959
oh yeah yeah jim bob had a really

766.399 --> 768.959
interesting

769.2 --> 774.0790000000001
live video

770.839 --> 777.0400000000001
yesterday and i mean i think the guy

774.079 --> 779.5999999999999
does like streams pretty much every day

777.04 --> 782.88
and he kind of does what i do except for

779.6 --> 784.5600000000001
him it it kind of works out a lot better

782.88 --> 786.8
maybe it's a time slot it's more

784.56 --> 789.04
american

786.8 --> 789.04
uh

789.2 --> 793.36
but and he's like a really funny guy

793.68 --> 799.76
but he interacts with chat a lot and i i

796.399 --> 804.399
i get very active in his chat

799.76 --> 807.4399999999999
pretty much maximum our win info

804.399 --> 807.44
and he does read him

808.16 --> 813.12
so it's always a blast being catching a

811.12 --> 815.2
life made by jim bob

813.12 --> 817.68
this time he was like disgusting

815.2 --> 818.639
philosophy about miracles and what they

817.68 --> 821.519
are

818.639 --> 821.519
which is of course

821.6 --> 826.5600000000001
yeah you could

824.0 --> 828.48
endlessly debate that

826.56 --> 830.6389999999999
but yeah it was a really interesting

828.48 --> 833.519
[Music]

830.639 --> 835.839
live show yesterday

833.519 --> 835.839
uh

838.24 --> 841.399
all right

854.56 --> 860.959
my grandfather is indigenous and they

858.0 --> 860.959
were lived

861.12 --> 867.48
on some land the bottom

863.68 --> 867.4799999999999
end of appalachians

870.32 --> 874.399
i've heard that

871.76 --> 876.72
name a lot appalachians but i don't

874.399 --> 879.12
exactly know geographically where that

876.72 --> 881.12
is so i'm gonna google it

879.12 --> 884.639
maybe then i'll finally evaporation

881.12 --> 885.68
mountains north america

884.639 --> 888.48
okay

885.68 --> 891.12
that's that helps

888.48 --> 891.12
where is it

893.12 --> 900.399
ah okay

895.839 --> 900.399
so it's like the wait what

901.68 --> 907.04
it's the western mountain ridge

905.12 --> 910.279
that goes all the way into canada is

907.04 --> 910.279
that right

913.519 --> 916.519
ugh

926.639 --> 933.839
all right from alabama

930.72 --> 933.839
into yeah

935.92 --> 940.5999999999999
into the northeast coast of canada

940.639 --> 945.799
right and kind of ends up in

942.72 --> 945.799
[Music]

945.839 --> 950.48
almost scottish type

948.32 --> 953.72
islands

950.48 --> 953.72
it's interesting

954.0 --> 958.0
right so that region northeast

959.12 --> 962.6
now i know

967.23 --> 970.369
[Music]

985.92 --> 988.92
hmm

988.94 --> 992.0490000000001
[Music]

1003.6 --> 1008.48
wow yeah carolina that's

1006.079 --> 1011.519
interesting and annoying

1008.48 --> 1013.839
but yeah i would have thought that just

1011.519 --> 1016.24
grave robbers would just start stealing

1013.839 --> 1016.24
bones

1017.6 --> 1022.399
like it's it's all pretty disgusting why

1022.959 --> 1026.079
why just like

1024.48 --> 1028.88
the old

1026.079 --> 1032.0
graves can't just be respected

1028.88 --> 1032.0
in general like

1032.72 --> 1040.24
like that is a an overall terrible thing

1036.24 --> 1043.039
it's like a curse like it's not even a

1040.24 --> 1044.88
curse it's just that people would do

1043.039 --> 1048.6
that

1044.88 --> 1048.6000000000001
curses things

1057.36 --> 1059.6789999999999
all right

1059.76 --> 1064.24
and like with grape robbers

1062.32 --> 1066.96
it's not even about oh they're taking

1064.24 --> 1069.919
all the valuables no it's about

1066.96 --> 1073.1200000000001
destroying the evidence it's that they

1069.919 --> 1073.1200000000001
destroy the graves

1074.24 --> 1077.6
that's the worst part

1078.559 --> 1085.32
it's the destruction of history and of

1080.96 --> 1085.32
knowledge that's kind of important

1112.16 --> 1116.88
right yeah caroline yeah i know they

1114.799 --> 1119.2
were always there and there probably

1116.88 --> 1120.3200000000002
have been graves like that for thousands

1119.2 --> 1123.3600000000001
of years

1120.32 --> 1125.76
or something long time

1123.36 --> 1127.9189999999999
and everybody would just respect it

1125.76 --> 1130.72
because it was like a significant

1127.919 --> 1130.72
ancient thing

1131.12 --> 1136.3999999999999
and people would naturally recognize it

1134.24 --> 1137.919
as like a blessing of the ancients and a

1136.4 --> 1139.2
reminder

1137.919 --> 1142.4
right

1139.2 --> 1142.4
but yeah then

1143.2 --> 1144.96
like

1144.16 --> 1146.64
this

1144.96 --> 1149.44
yeah

1146.64 --> 1151.679
this new demonic mentality came in and

1149.44 --> 1153.919
it's just like loot and destroy

1151.679 --> 1156.24
everything

1153.919 --> 1159.3600000000001
it's like loot and if there is no loot

1156.24 --> 1163.72
of worthy then destroy it it's

1159.36 --> 1163.7199999999998
savage it's beyond savage

1166.32 --> 1171.6789999999999
it's demonically possessed people that

1168.4 --> 1174.24
are roaming around destroying knowledge

1171.679 --> 1176.96
and that other people don't hunt didn't

1174.24 --> 1178.64
hunt them down

1176.96 --> 1181.6000000000001
is like

1178.64 --> 1184.48
also a curse it's a curse that they that

1181.6 --> 1187.36
people in america have let others just

1184.48 --> 1189.6
be demonic like that it's probably

1187.36 --> 1191.36
america's biggest curse

1189.6 --> 1193.84
modern america

1191.36 --> 1196.559
and you're dealing with it still

1193.84 --> 1198.72
oh you just let them be demonic eh oh

1196.559 --> 1200.6399999999999
it's not your problem yes they

1198.72 --> 1203.28
ravage

1200.64 --> 1205.3600000000001
everything around you oh it's

1203.28 --> 1207.6
no but they're american oh they don't

1205.36 --> 1209.039
know anybody yeah yeah yeah no you're

1207.6 --> 1210.48
letting them

1209.039 --> 1212.32
be possessed

1210.48 --> 1215.679
and then letting those demons that

1212.32 --> 1217.84
possess them destroy everything

1215.679 --> 1219.6000000000001
everything that's actually important

1217.84 --> 1222.8799999999999
even though you're too short-sighted to

1219.6 --> 1225.1999999999998
even realize how that works

1222.88 --> 1228.24
and that's like a big

1225.2 --> 1232.64
big ass curse on america and that curse

1228.24 --> 1235.84
can only be broken with a lot of blood

1232.64 --> 1235.8400000000001
and it's coming

1236.0 --> 1240.159
yeah

1236.88 --> 1243.0390000000002
if you allow the people around you to be

1240.159 --> 1245.6000000000001
fully demonically possessed and do

1243.039 --> 1249.28
damage

1245.6 --> 1252.08
let them do damage without like serious

1249.28 --> 1252.08
repercussion

1252.159 --> 1256.7990000000002
then yeah you curse

1254.48 --> 1259.3600000000001
you curse yourself you curse your

1256.799 --> 1261.6
species you curse the land

1259.36 --> 1263.039
through your negligence and that curse

1261.6 --> 1266.08
carries on

1263.039 --> 1268.72
keeps that tension that pushes those

1266.08 --> 1271.039
demons to manifest and do that keeps

1268.72 --> 1273.44
building and building and building and

1271.039 --> 1276.0
everybody turns insane and

1273.44 --> 1277.919
come open satanists and people start to

1276.0 --> 1280.159
like brag about how

1277.919 --> 1282.5590000000002
monstrous they are yeah that's because

1280.159 --> 1286.48
of that that's because

1282.559 --> 1288.24
even your ancestors they let people be

1286.48 --> 1291.2
demonically possess

1288.24 --> 1294.24
and destroy everything

1291.2 --> 1297.52
it's demonic negligence

1294.24 --> 1300.159
it's cowardice of the worst sort and of

1297.52 --> 1301.36
the most senseless sword right

1300.159 --> 1304.0800000000002
cowardice

1301.36 --> 1306.9599999999998
as in some kind of an advantage that's

1304.08 --> 1309.84
an annoying and low enough

1306.96 --> 1311.2
but if it's if it's not even

1309.84 --> 1315.52
sensible

1311.2 --> 1315.52
or profitable in a direct way

1315.84 --> 1320.24
or on the long term then it's just

1318.88 --> 1323.2800000000002
sickening

1320.24 --> 1325.6
cursed cowardice

1323.28 --> 1328.1589999999999
and you're all gonna deal with it

1325.6 --> 1329.28
even if you as individuals are not

1328.159 --> 1330.5590000000002
cowards

1329.28 --> 1332.96
you're part

1330.559 --> 1337.12
of the united states you're part of the

1332.96 --> 1339.76
spirit of everything there and your past

1337.12 --> 1343.12
so all the curses

1339.76 --> 1345.28
that were performed by ancestors or

1343.12 --> 1347.28
ancestor adjacent because a lot of those

1345.28 --> 1350.1589999999999
demonically possessed people that would

1347.28 --> 1354.24
do that would still end up just getting

1350.159 --> 1354.24
killed or killing themselves

1354.32 --> 1361.08
it still carries on

1356.48 --> 1361.08
because they were not stopped

1363.679 --> 1368.72
because you let it happen

1366.4 --> 1370.88
your ancestors they let it happen and

1368.72 --> 1373.039
now you bear the curse

1370.88 --> 1375.919
it's up to you now are you

1373.039 --> 1375.919
gonna stop him

1379.52 --> 1385.6
worldwide not just isa

1381.919 --> 1388.24
usa yeah but usa is like the dead center

1385.6 --> 1390.6399999999999
of it it's the worst there ever this the

1388.24 --> 1394.559
amount of stories

1390.64 --> 1396.96
the usa and its utter contempt

1394.559 --> 1400.1589999999999
for their own ancestry

1396.96 --> 1402.88
for for the people and for humanity and

1400.159 --> 1404.64
animals and nature in general the utter

1402.88 --> 1408.48
contempt is

1404.64 --> 1408.48
like unheard of in the world

1412.159 --> 1421.0390000000002
and the level of damage that demonically

1416.08 --> 1423.4399999999998
possessed people are allowed to do

1421.039 --> 1426.1589999999999
and other people just stand there and

1423.44 --> 1428.8400000000001
they even know it and they let it happen

1426.159 --> 1433.279
and they do nothing

1428.84 --> 1435.76
selfish negligent amnesia yeah that's in

1433.279 --> 1437.84
america it's there is no place in the

1435.76 --> 1439.039
world where it's worse

1437.84 --> 1442.48
where it has

1439.039 --> 1445.12
as much scars where so many damn so much

1442.48 --> 1447.559
damage has been done overall

1445.12 --> 1451.36
because america used to be like an

1447.559 --> 1455.2
unfathomable natural paradise in ways

1451.36 --> 1455.1999999999998
there's barely anything left of that

1455.679 --> 1461.52
it's a shadow of what it used to be and

1458.88 --> 1463.679
right and in europe

1461.52 --> 1464.96
yeah that's also happened except there

1463.679 --> 1468.88
were like

1464.96 --> 1470.32
thousands of years more

1468.88 --> 1473.0390000000002
over time

1470.32 --> 1475.12
of dealing with it and demonically

1473.039 --> 1479.76
possessed freaks that would destroy

1475.12 --> 1482.0
everything have been exterminated also

1479.76 --> 1484.96
we didn't just let them do it to

1482.0 --> 1488.4
everything and everyone

1484.96 --> 1488.4
in america they did

1489.12 --> 1494.32
it's like a characteristic

1492.88 --> 1497.919
like

1494.32 --> 1501.32
cowardice criminal negligence

1497.919 --> 1501.3200000000002
it's a theme

1509.84 --> 1512.84
right

1520.0 --> 1524.2
rafting middle east yeah

1529.6 --> 1535.039
middle east has its own kind of curse

1532.4 --> 1537.919
it's a also it's a very different type

1535.039 --> 1537.919
of land

1540.48 --> 1544.64
like it's much harsher overall

1551.52 --> 1558.4
like good spots in the middle east

1554.96 --> 1561.279
where you can actually grow things and

1558.4 --> 1561.8700000000001
have farms are much rarer overall than

1561.279 --> 1563.039
they are in

1561.87 --> 1566.52
[Music]

1563.039 --> 1566.52
in north america

1570.24 --> 1575.679
although maybe in the very very far past

1573.2 --> 1577.76
and in real ancient times it

1575.679 --> 1578.96
it might have not always been exactly

1577.76 --> 1581.44
like that

1578.96 --> 1584.32
maybe at some point the middle east was

1581.44 --> 1585.279
also kind of like

1584.32 --> 1587.4399999999998
like

1585.279 --> 1589.76
pre-colonial

1587.44 --> 1592.0800000000002
american type

1589.76 --> 1593.919
natural paradise maybe it used to be

1592.08 --> 1596.08
like that but you have to realize that

1593.919 --> 1599.3600000000001
geographically it's always like a

1596.08 --> 1601.9189999999999
crossing point so that's like when

1599.36 --> 1605.84
people started traveling

1601.919 --> 1607.76
in the first moments of creation

1605.84 --> 1610.08
the middle east would have been

1607.76 --> 1611.12
immediately like the first region to be

1610.08 --> 1613.039
crossed

1611.12 --> 1615.12
even if nobody lived there everybody

1613.039 --> 1617.279
would come past there and if

1615.12 --> 1620.8799999999999
because it's the dead center

1617.279 --> 1620.88
of eurasia africa

1621.52 --> 1626.1589999999999
so everybody would start traveling past

1623.919 --> 1628.64
it that's how then trading posts start

1626.159 --> 1630.4
that's how cities start and that's where

1628.64 --> 1633.1200000000001
it all starts

1630.4 --> 1635.679
and goes to hell and wars and yeah

1633.12 --> 1638.1589999999999
cutting to all the trees

1635.679 --> 1640.24
that's how it works

1638.159 --> 1642.88
because it because of its geographical

1640.24 --> 1642.88
location

1645.36 --> 1648.8799999999999
right so whatever paradise the middle

1647.279 --> 1653.64
east used to be

1648.88 --> 1653.64
it was pretty much the first to go

1661.76 --> 1667.279
yeah carolyn a i think but you're really

1664.88 --> 1671.279
are you talking more about

1667.279 --> 1671.279
that's like north africa right

1672.64 --> 1675.2
like uh

1678.48 --> 1682.279
what's it called again

1687.039 --> 1690.039
uh

1702.559 --> 1705.6789999999999
yeah libya and all

1708.84 --> 1714.48
that but yeah many of those places like

1712.32 --> 1716.8799999999999
they have been

1714.48 --> 1719.039
pretty good over time but i mean like

1716.88 --> 1722.919
the deserty stuff and all that that's

1719.039 --> 1722.919
been there for a while

1730.799 --> 1733.799
anyway

1739.12 --> 1745.4399999999998
the dutch colonial empire oh you mean

1742.48 --> 1748.0
the dutch colonial empire

1745.44 --> 1751.6000000000001
that was like

1748.0 --> 1756.24
one of the best colonial groups

1751.6 --> 1758.6399999999999
in that entire period of history yeah

1756.24 --> 1760.799
the one that actually made peaceful

1758.64 --> 1763.1200000000001
contact with pretty much everybody they

1760.799 --> 1766.1589999999999
bumped into and just started to

1763.12 --> 1768.9599999999998
build trade networks yeah oh i'm very i

1766.159 --> 1771.919
would gladly talk about that

1768.96 --> 1776.32
mr sussex

1771.919 --> 1776.3200000000002
because i'm not ashamed of dutch history

1776.64 --> 1782.0800000000002
at all

1778.559 --> 1782.08
i'm actually quite proud of it

1784.559 --> 1789.2
yeah we are talking about the same thing

1786.48 --> 1792.84
yeah yeah yeah hey why don't you mr

1789.2 --> 1794.799
sussex hey hey compare the dutch to

1792.84 --> 1796.399
england

1794.799 --> 1798.399
spain

1796.399 --> 1800.1589999999999
france portugal

1798.399 --> 1803.52
italy

1800.159 --> 1805.2
yeah yeah we were the best

1803.52 --> 1808.24
we were the most

1805.2 --> 1810.24
diplomatic the most trade oriented the

1808.24 --> 1812.48
most respectful

1810.24 --> 1814.799
the most

1812.48 --> 1817.919
interested

1814.799 --> 1820.96
in in nativity yeah we were

1817.919 --> 1823.039
absolutely the dutch colonists were

1820.96 --> 1825.76
those

1823.039 --> 1826.96
i'm very proud of that

1825.76 --> 1829.76
yeah

1826.96 --> 1832.72
yes we were why did you compare them to

1829.76 --> 1835.8799999999999
the other colonialist huh huh yeah yeah

1832.72 --> 1835.88
we were

1842.399 --> 1848.1589999999999
that's a very blinkered view oh that's

1844.48 --> 1850.799
such a great in-content response i mean

1848.159 --> 1852.3990000000001
god you have such a great argument

1850.799 --> 1854.96
seem to know everything about this

1852.399 --> 1854.9599999999998
subject

1856.48 --> 1859.48
right

1871.36 --> 1876.24
the dutch east india company

1873.76 --> 1878.64
yeah yeah the dutch east indian company

1876.24 --> 1882.08
yeah but you see

1878.64 --> 1884.0800000000002
that wasn't even really the dutch

1882.08 --> 1886.1589999999999
imperialist that that

1884.08 --> 1888.6399999999999
that's what grew out of it

1886.159 --> 1891.6000000000001
the dutch east india company

1888.64 --> 1894.7990000000002
was well the giant trade network that

1891.6 --> 1897.12
remained but guess what you know who was

1894.799 --> 1899.9189999999999
basically running that

1897.12 --> 1899.9189999999999
the locals

1900.159 --> 1904.5590000000002
most of it's like yeah there were dutch

1902.72 --> 1905.6000000000001
sailors among them

1904.559 --> 1909.9189999999999
but

1905.6 --> 1912.24
most of it was just like local

1909.919 --> 1913.519
they took local we took locals the dutch

1912.24 --> 1915.44
took locals

1913.519 --> 1918.159
trained them

1915.44 --> 1919.2
and then they would basically hold the

1918.159 --> 1921.679
fort

1919.2 --> 1925.6000000000001
hold the trade for it

1921.679 --> 1928.72
yeah so yeah then if regional

1925.6 --> 1931.039
wars break out or conflicts yeah that

1928.72 --> 1933.279
can get really rough and

1931.039 --> 1934.8799999999999
dutch east india company would then

1933.279 --> 1937.76
absolutely

1934.88 --> 1940.0
protect its interests and brutally so if

1937.76 --> 1942.24
necessary right they would sometimes

1940.0 --> 1943.36
deal with cannibal [ __ ] and all that

1942.24 --> 1945.519
crazy

1943.36 --> 1947.6
savages

1945.519 --> 1949.279
and then they would absolutely freaking

1947.6 --> 1950.559
kill him off

1949.279 --> 1952.32
yeah

1950.559 --> 1954.24
so

1952.32 --> 1955.039
i'm sorry

1954.24 --> 1957.519
no

1955.039 --> 1959.12
yeah the dutch the dutch east india

1957.519 --> 1961.519
company that's not really the

1959.12 --> 1964.8799999999999
netherlands it's what it grew into

1961.519 --> 1967.76
it was kind of taken over later as even

1964.88 --> 1969.919
historically registered i think

1967.76 --> 1972.08
by england

1969.919 --> 1973.679
that's when it it really started to

1972.08 --> 1977.1999999999998
become shitty that's when they started

1973.679 --> 1980.64
to lose respect for natives

1977.2 --> 1983.039
because the dutch were always like

1980.64 --> 1983.039
very

1985.44 --> 1991.2
yeah compatible always like no you just

1988.64 --> 1993.44
deal with understand the local people

1991.2 --> 1995.679
get their respect and then

1993.44 --> 1999.6000000000001
they will be your allies that was the

1995.679 --> 2002.48
dutch style that's how we did everything

1999.6 --> 2004.32
that's how we colonize the world we did

2002.48 --> 2006.88
it's not even like colonization that

2004.32 --> 2009.279
much it's not like we just forced

2006.88 --> 2013.44
europeans like now you go live there and

2009.279 --> 2016.84
you you kill off the locals no no

2013.44 --> 2016.8400000000001
not at all

2019.2 --> 2023.919
but yeah yeah you just move on to

2020.96 --> 2023.919
another subject

2024.559 --> 2028.1589999999999
huh

2025.44 --> 2031.799
just just go on and address somebody in

2028.159 --> 2031.7990000000002

2041.44 --> 2046.48
why don't you leave this terrible dutch

2044.08 --> 2049.2799999999997
colonialist

2046.48 --> 2050.72
who actually criticizes america for

2049.28 --> 2054.32
legitimate

2050.72 --> 2057.2799999999997
deeper rooted you could say spiritual

2054.32 --> 2059.44
issues a curse that they have yeah which

2057.28 --> 2061.599
i will address because that curse

2059.44 --> 2062.879
remains lingering right

2061.599 --> 2065.76
that you're dealing with a whole

2062.879 --> 2070.359
different set of problems

2065.76 --> 2070.3590000000004
right now what's left of it

2079.919 --> 2087.0789999999997
the dutch re-education of india what are

2082.639 --> 2087.079
you talking about dutch re-education

2095.679 --> 2100.56
india

2098.079 --> 2103.8390000000004
we didn't even really even settle in

2100.56 --> 2103.839
india that was england

2113.44 --> 2118.64
you're not the group

2115.599 --> 2119.76
you i was told you were oh wow

2118.64 --> 2122.64
okay

2119.76 --> 2125.5200000000004
well what were you told then mr sussex

2122.64 --> 2129.0789999999997
keeps complaining

2125.52 --> 2129.079
hey elise g

2132.48 --> 2136.04
lydia logs

2144.32 --> 2148.2400000000002
i don't really care what people use well

2146.079 --> 2149.8390000000004
that's not really a good attitude lydia

2148.24 --> 2152.24
logs

2149.839 --> 2154.16
you should care what people used to do

2152.24 --> 2157.4399999999996
because

2154.16 --> 2159.839
they their actions echo on into you so

2157.44 --> 2159.839
it matters

2163.839 --> 2168.72
also it's how we learn what do you mean

2166.24 --> 2171.04
how it's what you learn

2168.72 --> 2174.64
do you realize what they've done you

2171.04 --> 2177.119
realize their mistake can you prevent

2174.64 --> 2178.24
becoming a repetition of the mistakes of

2177.119 --> 2182.44
the past

2178.24 --> 2182.4399999999996
can you overcome their mistakes

2186.16 --> 2190.56
right

2188.24 --> 2192.24
like this insane notion that you can

2190.56 --> 2196.16
just let

2192.24 --> 2200.56
demonically possessed insane people

2196.16 --> 2201.839
go about and destroy things like burn

2200.56 --> 2204.64
[ __ ]

2201.839 --> 2208.4
kill random people

2204.64 --> 2211.56
and just or yeah otherwise do just

2208.4 --> 2214.32
provable palpable terrible

2211.56 --> 2215.44
demoralizing damage and just let them do

2214.32 --> 2219.839
it yeah

2215.44 --> 2222.2400000000002
like that's something that needs to stop

2219.839 --> 2224.48
it was very prevalent in the us it's

2222.24 --> 2229.1189999999997
rife with it like

2224.48 --> 2231.92
every thing about everyone there is rife

2229.119 --> 2233.359
with that with the negligence

2231.92 --> 2236.96
just letting

2233.359 --> 2239.839
absolutely intolerably evil people

2236.96 --> 2243.839
destroy things and people

2239.839 --> 2243.839
and just letting them do that

2244.48 --> 2252.48
it's unacceptable and it curses them

2249.25 --> 2252.48
[Music]

2270.16 --> 2276.0789999999997
imagine how preposterous it really is

2274.32 --> 2278.32
if you put it into context of everything

2276.079 --> 2281.119
i just discussed right that negligence

2278.32 --> 2282.4
letting if people destroy things in your

2281.119 --> 2284.56
own land

2282.4 --> 2286.0
around cities

2284.56 --> 2288.0
and then just

2286.0 --> 2292.16
compare that history

2288.0 --> 2294.8
to the absurd situation

2292.16 --> 2295.92
where then suddenly world war one world

2294.8 --> 2299.04
war ii

2295.92 --> 2301.839
and now america has to suddenly oh oh we

2299.04 --> 2304.079
have to stop the baddies we have to stop

2301.839 --> 2307.2
the baddies says

2304.079 --> 2309.04
the descendants of total demonic

2307.2 --> 2310.7999999999997
psychopaths that have literally

2309.04 --> 2313.52
destroyed your land

2310.8 --> 2314.88
and then everybody actually buys into

2313.52 --> 2317.839
that

2314.88 --> 2321.119
they buy in

2317.839 --> 2322.88
to the people that have destroyed

2321.119 --> 2324.88
their spirit and their land and their

2322.88 --> 2329.119
ancestors

2324.88 --> 2329.119
to actually send their own kids

2329.359 --> 2335.839
overseas to their stop something it's so

2333.44 --> 2338.7200000000003
pathetic

2335.839 --> 2338.72
so pathetic

2339.52 --> 2343.68
right

2340.4 --> 2347.119
it's so pathetic it almost almost not

2343.68 --> 2350.3999999999996
really but almost makes me sympathize

2347.119 --> 2353.28
with the demonic spirit that possessed

2350.4 --> 2355.28
those disgusting people it almost makes

2353.28 --> 2358.1600000000003
me sympathize with them

2355.28 --> 2360.079
it's so pathetic

2358.16 --> 2362.7999999999997
because americans

2360.079 --> 2366.079
they just let demonic

2362.8 --> 2368.7200000000003
disgusting people destroy everything

2366.079 --> 2370.7200000000003
they don't do anything about it

2368.72 --> 2374.48
and then those same people will tell

2370.72 --> 2376.0789999999997
them oh we have to stop this oh center

2374.48 --> 2378.56
send your kids

2376.079 --> 2380.6400000000003
as cannon father we have to stop that

2378.56 --> 2383.2799999999997
over there

2380.64 --> 2384.72
says the people that have literally been

2383.28 --> 2388.079
ravaging

2384.72 --> 2390.56
and demoralizing and destroying your own

2388.079 --> 2393.98
people and your land

2390.56 --> 2397.0589999999997
isn't that just special

2393.98 --> 2397.059
[Music]

2406.9 --> 2411.839
[Music]

2409.68 --> 2411.839
you

2447.68 --> 2451.9199999999996
right

2448.64 --> 2454.56
yeah i get lydia logs it is your point

2451.92 --> 2456.7200000000003
but my point is that oh so when you're

2454.56 --> 2459.599
gonna learn about it

2456.72 --> 2462.3999999999996
how are you not going to repeat those

2459.599 --> 2463.6800000000003
certain parts of it those parts where

2462.4 --> 2465.839
people

2463.68 --> 2468.7999999999997
figured out what was going on and then

2465.839 --> 2470.48
let it happen how are you not going to

2468.8 --> 2472.6400000000003
repeat that

2470.48 --> 2474.16
lydia look that's a direct question to

2472.64 --> 2476.48
you

2474.16 --> 2478.96
since you're so confident that you just

2476.48 --> 2482.64
learned from history so you don't repeat

2478.96 --> 2485.28
it oh that's such a trope so how does

2482.64 --> 2488.0
that actually apply to what you do with

2485.28 --> 2490.8
what you learn how are you not

2488.0 --> 2493.04
repeating history

2490.8 --> 2494.8
huh have you ever even asked that

2493.04 --> 2497.2
question

2494.8 --> 2499.28
it just satisfied with rolling out the

2497.2 --> 2501.68
trope

2499.28 --> 2504.1600000000003
everybody recognized oh that's just

2501.68 --> 2505.2799999999997
general wisdom yeah are you actually

2504.16 --> 2509.0789999999997
doing it

2505.28 --> 2509.079
huh are you

2514.0 --> 2519.68
[Music]

2516.96 --> 2522.7200000000003
or you're doing the same thing

2519.68 --> 2525.68
is absolute absurd evil

2522.72 --> 2529.9199999999996
is finding a new stepping stone

2525.68 --> 2529.9199999999996
to get more damage in

2530.24 --> 2534.839
how are you not repeating history how

2533.2 --> 2539.4399999999996
are you

2534.839 --> 2539.44
not letting it just happen

2546.24 --> 2551.04
we should learn oh yeah okay so you're

2548.24 --> 2553.1189999999997
not okay right yeah yeah so you were not

2551.04 --> 2555.52
talking about your uh yeah it didn't

2553.119 --> 2558.0
apply to you yeah we should learn

2555.52 --> 2559.68
but you're not are you

2558.0 --> 2562.0
so you're doing the same thing yeah well

2559.68 --> 2565.48
you're a real american felt that about

2562.0 --> 2565.48
you for a while

2572.4 --> 2576.2400000000002
right it's not just your problem it's

2574.56 --> 2579.44
everybody so

2576.24 --> 2581.4399999999996
does that relinquish the responsibility

2579.44 --> 2583.599
that you have

2581.44 --> 2586.88
just like every individual in the

2583.599 --> 2589.28
country in the past that let it happen

2586.88 --> 2591.2000000000003
for several reasons

2589.28 --> 2594.079
you just like that as well

2591.2 --> 2596.3999999999996
just echoes

2594.079 --> 2599.44
from spirits of your ancestors that

2596.4 --> 2603.64
you're just repeating it's like oh

2599.44 --> 2603.64
well this is a good reason

2610.16 --> 2613.16
ah

2631.2 --> 2636.64
now i'm just shaving you lydia logs

2634.24 --> 2637.5989999999997
come on i'm shaming all americans right

2636.64 --> 2640.48
now

2637.599 --> 2640.48
and they deserve it

2640.88 --> 2643.28
because

2643.76 --> 2648.88
i think they're kind of pathetic overall

2646.0 --> 2650.64
yeah i said it

2648.88 --> 2652.4
all you do

2650.64 --> 2655.44
like throughout your culture throughout

2652.4 --> 2657.359
the generations is just spout how great

2655.44 --> 2659.839
everything is as everything is

2657.359 --> 2662.56
absolutely the opposite it's pathetic

2659.839 --> 2664.16
it's cowardice it's demonic it's

2662.56 --> 2669.0
negligent

2664.16 --> 2669.0
it's self-destructive it's anti-nature

2670.48 --> 2675.44
but hey every american when you inquire

2673.119 --> 2677.6800000000003
oh they know exactly how to respond

2675.44 --> 2679.68
though oh it's oh we should learn from

2677.68 --> 2681.68
history oh yeah but it's not just

2679.68 --> 2684.48
individual we're all together so the

2681.68 --> 2687.04
group oh yeah how many more excuses can

2684.48 --> 2689.839
you just whip up like that

2687.04 --> 2692.16
to not take your personal individual

2689.839 --> 2695.16
responsibility in the face of what's

2692.16 --> 2695.16
happening

2709.92 --> 2714.96
i mean how long is it gonna take

2713.2 --> 2719.7599999999998
how long is it gonna take before the

2714.96 --> 2722.16
demon manifests in such a way that

2719.76 --> 2724.7200000000003
like the sjw

2722.16 --> 2725.92
crazy people that say oh whities must

2724.72 --> 2727.7599999999998
die

2725.92 --> 2730.48
that it's not a joke anymore and

2727.76 --> 2733.5200000000004
suddenly they are actually trained

2730.48 --> 2736.88
dedicated religious zealots that are

2733.52 --> 2739.599
just going to literally execute every

2736.88 --> 2741.92
freaking person in the country

2739.599 --> 2744.7200000000003
go from place to place and just kill

2741.92 --> 2747.28
everybody is it going to come to that

2744.72 --> 2750.16
because i mean you as an individual yeah

2747.28 --> 2752.0
what could you do

2750.16 --> 2754.48
it's the group oh

2752.0 --> 2757.119
we're all responsible yeah and you're

2754.48 --> 2761.52
all going to die if you don't [ __ ] do

2757.119 --> 2764.6400000000003
anything about it like your ancestors

2761.52 --> 2769.8
that made this all grow worse

2764.64 --> 2769.7999999999997
i'm sorry i'm being very rough on you

2780.48 --> 2784.56
for [ __ ] sake i'm not american i'm

2782.16 --> 2788.16
british i live in england

2784.56 --> 2790.0
well for you it's even worse

2788.16 --> 2792.0
but you look at your nobility look at

2790.0 --> 2794.4
what they're doing

2792.0 --> 2796.96
how they do it

2794.4 --> 2798.4
like it's even up close and more in your

2796.96 --> 2800.4
face

2798.4 --> 2803.28
like you don't even have an excuse as

2800.4 --> 2806.0
like oh it's just like that's hundreds

2803.28 --> 2808.0
and hundreds of miles away

2806.0 --> 2810.48
i'm on the other side of the country we

2808.0 --> 2814.16
never even here we don't deal with that

2810.48 --> 2817.839
no you're actually much closer

2814.16 --> 2817.839
to the hearth of the problem

2818.72 --> 2823.359
physically

2820.56 --> 2823.359
and it's showing

2825.599 --> 2828.599
anyway

2834.0 --> 2839.52
i'm a russian spy broadcasting from the

2836.96 --> 2839.52
us

2843.44 --> 2848.319
yeah that's why youtube isn't taking me

2845.119 --> 2848.319
down i'm sure

2850.079 --> 2853.3590000000004
right

2851.2 --> 2854.8799999999997
yeah the funny thing is is that the

2853.359 --> 2856.48
russians

2854.88 --> 2858.6400000000003
in their history they've

2856.48 --> 2860.16
dealt with the same [ __ ] like they went

2858.64 --> 2862.5589999999997
through communism which is like the

2860.16 --> 2864.72
worst curse you can imagine what they

2862.559 --> 2869.28
went through

2864.72 --> 2870.839
and negligence was the greatest trauma

2869.28 --> 2874.2400000000002
the funny thing is

2870.839 --> 2876.0
though it seems like the entire

2874.24 --> 2877.2799999999997
culture

2876.0 --> 2879.44
as a whole

2877.28 --> 2881.52
they learned from it

2879.44 --> 2883.359
and there's they're like

2881.52 --> 2885.92
they halted it

2883.359 --> 2888.16
they don't do that anymore i mean

2885.92 --> 2889.16
there's still negligence here and there

2888.16 --> 2893.2799999999997
and

2889.16 --> 2893.2799999999997
dissatisfaction sadism maybe

2893.359 --> 2897.04
situations whatever

2897.44 --> 2901.28
but

2899.359 --> 2903.52
it's like they all have a much more

2901.28 --> 2905.599
visceral understanding of the challenge

2903.52 --> 2908.24
of god

2905.599 --> 2910.48
and that you can't let that [ __ ]

2908.24 --> 2913.4399999999996
that like

2910.48 --> 2915.839
uncontrolled liberalism

2913.44 --> 2918.079
is effectively demonic and that if you

2915.839 --> 2920.16
let that happen that you will literally

2918.079 --> 2922.0
curse your people and you curse the land

2920.16 --> 2924.48
and that's what typically happens during

2922.0 --> 2927.44
communism and they've experienced it

2924.48 --> 2930.319
and a lot of them learn from it

2927.44 --> 2933.04
and the subsequent generations after

2930.319 --> 2935.04
have learned from them

2933.04 --> 2937.7599999999998
so they're like one of the people that

2935.04 --> 2938.5589999999997
actually are overcoming it

2937.76 --> 2940.559
right

2938.559 --> 2942.88
so yeah then that kind of makes me a bit

2940.559 --> 2944.4
of a russophile

2942.88 --> 2946.559
even though i've never actually been

2944.4 --> 2946.559
there

2948.0 --> 2952.079
because at least

2949.76 --> 2954.3190000000004
they're actually trying

2952.079 --> 2956.559
in where they should be trying

2954.319 --> 2960.319
instead of just like

2956.559 --> 2962.559
virtue signaling about all their stuff

2960.319 --> 2962.5589999999997
right

2966.38 --> 2969.57
[Music]

2969.76 --> 2972.3190000000004
no but

2974.4 --> 2981.28
yeah but i am kind of a bit i i am very

2976.96 --> 2982.48
much a revolutionary type of spirit

2981.28 --> 2983.52
and i'm

2982.48 --> 2985.359
just

2983.52 --> 2987.7599999999998
very impatient

2985.359 --> 2987.7599999999998
in it

2994.16 --> 2998.5589999999997
and that's a bit of problem

2995.76 --> 3002.96
patience is a virtue after all

2998.559 --> 3002.96
and i seem to have misplaced it

3009.2 --> 3014.72
i'm just really freaking sick of the

3012.24 --> 3016.8799999999997
demons in general i want them all out i

3014.72 --> 3019.359
want them out i want them i don't want

3016.88 --> 3021.839
to be able to sense them anymore

3019.359 --> 3023.44
not because i'm hiding that sense but

3021.839 --> 3025.68
because there's literally nothing to

3023.44 --> 3028.8
pick up anymore i want them gone i want

3025.68 --> 3028.7999999999997
them out of this realm

3036.8 --> 3040.6400000000003
i want the trauma cycle to be broken

3038.96 --> 3041.839
because that's how they keep themselves

3040.64 --> 3044.16
in there

3041.839 --> 3046.72
that's how they

3044.16 --> 3049.1189999999997
transplant that spirit onto the next

3046.72 --> 3052.5589999999997
generation through

3049.119 --> 3054.96
purposely inflicted trauma

3052.559 --> 3058.3190000000004
certain things that are even subtle

3054.96 --> 3059.76
things you don't want to understand

3058.319 --> 3061.52
right

3059.76 --> 3064.4
the things they do to their own you

3061.52 --> 3069.64
don't want to understand you just want

3064.4 --> 3069.64
to cut off the cycle

3069.76 --> 3073.119
and the only way you do it is through

3071.52 --> 3075.04
death

3073.119 --> 3077.839
it's the only thing that can actually

3075.04 --> 3080.16
stop it they could stop it it's super

3077.839 --> 3082.72
punishing they pretty much lose anything

3080.16 --> 3085.52
every everything anyway

3082.72 --> 3087.359
even if they try because the people that

3085.52 --> 3089.52
are in those positions becoming those

3087.359 --> 3090.7999999999997
demonically possessed

3089.52 --> 3094.16
trash

3090.8 --> 3096.96
they've already already lost everything

3094.16 --> 3098.96
the everything is already taken

3096.96 --> 3103.04
that's why they do it and the only way

3098.96 --> 3103.04
to stop it is to kill them

3108.4 --> 3113.2000000000003
that's the only way you break the cycle

3110.64 --> 3116.319
is by literally preventing

3113.2 --> 3117.359
the people from transplanting their

3116.319 --> 3119.68
demon

3117.359 --> 3124.52
onto the next generation

3119.68 --> 3124.52
the only way to do it is to kill them

3132.0 --> 3136.48
yeah it's not about them coming after

3134.319 --> 3138.96
you

3136.48 --> 3142.16
it's about them coming after everybody

3138.96 --> 3143.599
else and kids and their own freaking

3142.16 --> 3144.64
kids

3143.599 --> 3146.4
yeah

3144.64 --> 3149.839
they come after their own kids how is

3146.4 --> 3150.839
your glock 44 going to protect

3149.839 --> 3153.44
those

3150.839 --> 3154.64
victims that only protects you and

3153.44 --> 3156.559
they're not going to come after you

3154.64 --> 3158.319
because you have that right that's not

3156.559 --> 3161.0400000000004
the problem the problem is not that you

3158.319 --> 3163.119
don't have enough armor the problem is

3161.04 --> 3165.2799999999997
the in action

3163.119 --> 3168.319
that you have with the armor it's like

3165.28 --> 3172.96
the paladin that's all ready to face

3168.319 --> 3176.2799999999997
evil but he never goes out to face evil

3172.96 --> 3176.28
it's negligence

3180.0 --> 3184.64
you have to confront it

3183.119 --> 3187.6800000000003
you must

3184.64 --> 3187.68
or you fail

3191.28 --> 3195.8390000000004
putting on armor doesn't solve the

3193.599 --> 3195.839
problem

3199.28 --> 3206.48
it only really actually poses a

3201.76 --> 3210.2400000000002
seduction it's like oh so i'm safe now

3206.48 --> 3213.04
that [ __ ] can't happen to me well then i

3210.24 --> 3216.8799999999997
can ignore everything

3213.04 --> 3219.2
and just focus on what i'm doing

3216.88 --> 3221.28
and then just oh i'm gonna build a

3219.2 --> 3224.0789999999997
better world where that doesn't exist

3221.28 --> 3226.4
well guess what that out there it still

3224.079 --> 3229.28
exists and it still goes on and you

3226.4 --> 3229.28
didn't stop it

3229.76 --> 3233.76
yeah it's not with you

3234.079 --> 3238.48
your thing

3235.76 --> 3241.5200000000004
but that thing you make that's safe with

3238.48 --> 3242.4
you only lasts as long as you lift

3241.52 --> 3244.64
right

3242.4 --> 3246.2400000000002
that [ __ ] going on out there is still

3244.64 --> 3250.4
going to continue and it's going to grow

3246.24 --> 3252.72
worse because you didn't stop it that's

3250.4 --> 3252.7200000000003
why

3253.04 --> 3257.079
you let it happen

3267.359 --> 3270.359
uh

3283.52 --> 3286.4
and anyway

3286.559 --> 3291.3590000000004
how do we stop it

3288.37 --> 3293.7599999999998
[Music]

3291.359 --> 3294.88
by recognizing what is keeping it in

3293.76 --> 3298.96
place

3294.88 --> 3298.96
and then surgically removing it

3302.079 --> 3305.599
right

3303.2 --> 3307.839
and that basically means

3305.599 --> 3307.839
well

3308.319 --> 3312.0
breaking the contract breaking the

3310.079 --> 3314.1600000000003
contract

3312.0 --> 3316.4
of law and society

3314.16 --> 3318.24
vigilantism right

3316.4 --> 3320.88
because guess what

3318.24 --> 3324.0789999999997
they're already breaking it and like

3320.88 --> 3325.6800000000003
savagely i mean savagely breaking it as

3324.079 --> 3327.76
soon as you try to break it they'll

3325.68 --> 3329.839
actually respect you and try to graft

3327.76 --> 3330.7200000000003
you in their group that's what they do

3329.839 --> 3333.599
right

3330.72 --> 3337.2
guess what don't do that

3333.599 --> 3339.839
and then dedicate everything to removing

3337.2 --> 3341.9199999999996
them especially the people that come to

3339.839 --> 3343.92
you to seduce you

3341.92 --> 3345.52
once you take that stand

3343.92 --> 3348.52
those are the first people you need to

3345.52 --> 3348.52
remove

3349.359 --> 3353.44
yeah because there is no more society

3352.0 --> 3358.72
there is no more

3353.44 --> 3360.799
social contract it's just a illusion now

3358.72 --> 3363.839
they're not using that

3360.799 --> 3363.839
they're just

3364.16 --> 3370.24
keeping up the dream so people can just

3367.359 --> 3372.16
dream like it's still okay

3370.24 --> 3374.64
they don't hold themselves to that

3372.16 --> 3374.64
anymore

3375.04 --> 3380.319
they go over lines

3377.92 --> 3382.7200000000003
and then they just cover it up so the

3380.319 --> 3384.72
illusion that it's all just still fine

3382.72 --> 3386.5589999999997
and dandy and respectful and according

3384.72 --> 3389.52
to law

3386.559 --> 3391.6800000000003
that that illusion is maintained outward

3389.52 --> 3395.52
right

3391.68 --> 3398.0789999999997
so yeah you can actually just break that

3395.52 --> 3401.359
and just like okay i'm not buying in

3398.079 --> 3401.3590000000004
this illusion anymore

3402.16 --> 3406.3999999999996
and that means

3403.599 --> 3407.92
basically yeah wild wild west style

3406.4 --> 3409.44
justice

3407.92 --> 3412.0
right which is

3409.44 --> 3415.28
vigilantism it is what it is and oh my

3412.0 --> 3415.28
god afterward and

3417.359 --> 3422.88
right there's always a price like it no

3420.799 --> 3427.52
good deed

3422.88 --> 3433.1600000000003
will be done unpunished that's a fact

3427.52 --> 3433.16
that's an unfortunately is that's a fact

3433.28 --> 3437.92
right it's ironic though

3435.76 --> 3440.88
that evil deeds

3437.92 --> 3443.92
seem to go unpunished right and that's

3440.88 --> 3445.92
the problem is it it it goes on but it

3443.92 --> 3448.559
keeps going it keeps going because

3445.92 --> 3450.2400000000002
you're letting it because you think

3448.559 --> 3453.28
that you can't do anything about you

3450.24 --> 3455.9199999999996
think you can't go too far

3453.28 --> 3457.28
you think you can't break that illusory

3455.92 --> 3459.92
contract

3457.28 --> 3461.6800000000003
that they wave in front of your face to

3459.92 --> 3463.28
make you stand down

3461.68 --> 3465.359
right they're just

3463.28 --> 3467.119
doing atrocities and atrocities and then

3465.359 --> 3469.7599999999998
they're holding that contract in front

3467.119 --> 3471.2000000000003
of your face to make you stand down

3469.76 --> 3475.119
and you believe

3471.2 --> 3477.2
that they can or they have figured a way

3475.119 --> 3478.96
to do what they do and still hold

3477.2 --> 3482.3999999999996
themselves to the contract well that's

3478.96 --> 3484.7200000000003
wrong that's a lie that's an illusion

3482.4 --> 3487.359
and every time you buy it

3484.72 --> 3491.72
they grow worse

3487.359 --> 3491.72
they grow worse

3504.96 --> 3510.28
boondock saints yeah that's a tricky

3507.28 --> 3510.28
movie

3540.079 --> 3545.599
i know flatter sage yeah

3543.2 --> 3547.5989999999997
i know you meant well it's a good it's

3545.599 --> 3550.319
good to be the self-defender and all

3547.599 --> 3552.7200000000003
that i was just kind of making a point i

3550.319 --> 3554.079
kind of hijacked your point in doing

3552.72 --> 3556.72
that sorry

3554.079 --> 3560.48
don't take it all too personal

3556.72 --> 3560.48
i mean in a way i want you to

3561.52 --> 3566.72
right

3563.68 --> 3570.72
i'm just being confrontive about like an

3566.72 --> 3570.72
almost impossible to solve

3570.839 --> 3577.92
issue it's a curse and only like

3574.24 --> 3579.839
seriously serious great sacrifice can

3577.92 --> 3582.64
even

3579.839 --> 3584.24
hope to stop it

3582.64 --> 3586.319
and it must happen because it's gonna

3584.24 --> 3590.799
get worse and worse and worse and then

3586.319 --> 3590.799
at some point everybody dies

3594.799 --> 3599.079
and it's not a good ending

3600.799 --> 3606.319
it means the demons won

3603.28 --> 3608.88
and then they seed themselves

3606.319 --> 3610.079
then forgetfulness will overcome the

3608.88 --> 3612.079
land

3610.079 --> 3615.44
other people will move in

3612.079 --> 3617.599
and then they get hooked on the same

3615.44 --> 3621.2000000000003
curse and then the demons during their

3617.599 --> 3625.3590000000004
generations will be even worse

3621.2 --> 3627.4399999999996
it gets worse and worse and worse until

3625.359 --> 3631.2
a whole bunch of people

3627.44 --> 3633.28
decide to basically make spiritual

3631.2 --> 3637.5989999999997
personal sacrifice

3633.28 --> 3640.4
and end it and the demonic reign

3637.599 --> 3642.88
and it will always come with a price you

3640.4 --> 3646.4
cannot walk away from that

3642.88 --> 3646.4
in just glory

3653.44 --> 3659.599
it's a bill that is

3657.2 --> 3662.72
on the spirit side and it's

3659.599 --> 3664.079
yeah the debt is high it's only going to

3662.72 --> 3666.24
get higher it's

3664.079 --> 3668.6400000000003
paying enough is never going to be like

3666.24 --> 3670.799
oh i'm rich now never no it's just

3668.64 --> 3672.8799999999997
paying off debt and it's only going to

3670.799 --> 3674.799
get worse and if nobody does it then

3672.88 --> 3677.359
everybody dies

3674.799 --> 3679.119
and then other innocent groups

3677.359 --> 3681.2
will be drawn in

3679.119 --> 3682.839
and then they will be cursed too and

3681.2 --> 3686.799
then they will be

3682.839 --> 3690.16
forced to do the same thing

3686.799 --> 3693.28
it's a never-ending cycle of torture

3690.16 --> 3695.64
and injustice and evil and destruction

3693.28 --> 3698.73
and poison

3695.64 --> 3698.73
[Music]

3719.599 --> 3727.839
hmm yeah at least you yeah i bet

3722.96 --> 3727.839
i'd like to think of myself like that

3728.079 --> 3733.8390000000004
but yeah my knighthood consists mostly

3730.88 --> 3733.839
of just words

3736.559 --> 3739.2000000000003
what is it

3739.28 --> 3742.7200000000003
big splash going down

3750.559 --> 3754.119
right big cloud

3758.079 --> 3761.599
i'm really glad i went for groceries

3760.4 --> 3764.96
earlier

3761.599 --> 3767.96
i'm really really glad

3764.96 --> 3767.96
ah

3774.24 --> 3777.24
anyway

3806.37 --> 3809.489
[Music]

3819.039 --> 3823.6800000000003
right so yeah i'm

3821.839 --> 3826.96
i'm very much willing at this point to

3823.68 --> 3829.2
move on to slightly lighthearted more

3826.96 --> 3832.799
lighthearted subjects because

3829.2 --> 3834.3999999999996
like it is kind of depressing

3832.799 --> 3837.96
that curse thing

3834.4 --> 3837.96
and what it requires

3838.16 --> 3841.7599999999998
like guys if i

3843.359 --> 3848.5589999999997
like

3844.96 --> 3850.799
i've been tricked on the spiritual side

3848.559 --> 3853.44
like this was a big part of the demons

3850.799 --> 3855.92
what they tried to do during my vision

3853.44 --> 3858.64
was to try to trick me into thinking

3855.92 --> 3860.4
that i could sacrifice myself to stop it

3858.64 --> 3861.7599999999998
all

3860.4 --> 3863.119
and it was

3861.76 --> 3868.079
very

3863.119 --> 3872.1600000000003
very convincing along the entire ride

3868.079 --> 3874.88
but it was an illusion it's a lie

3872.16 --> 3877.839
the dots never connected it was never

3874.88 --> 3880.0
real it was just an attempt to trick me

3877.839 --> 3882.0789999999997
to basically

3880.0 --> 3884.64
die

3882.079 --> 3885.76
for the belief that it might stop that

3884.64 --> 3888.8799999999997
way

3885.76 --> 3888.88
it was brutal

3890.079 --> 3893.7200000000003
it's all a lie

3895.52 --> 3900.16
you dying does not make the darkness

3899.039 --> 3903.8390000000004
stop

3900.16 --> 3903.839
it just makes the pain stop

3905.119 --> 3909.6800000000003
it just

3906.16 --> 3913.7599999999998
makes you lay down

3909.68 --> 3913.7599999999998
the responsibility and the power

3914.24 --> 3919.8799999999997
that's all

3916.319 --> 3919.88
and it is cowardice

3933.2 --> 3937.4399999999996
right

3934.319 --> 3940.599
so even when you for example hear about

3937.44 --> 3943.359
the idea of overpopulation right

3940.599 --> 3945.599
overpopulation was never a problem it

3943.359 --> 3947.839
will never be a problem

3945.599 --> 3949.599
when they say overpopulation it's not

3947.839 --> 3950.72
actually overpopulation that's the

3949.599 --> 3952.96
problem

3950.72 --> 3952.9599999999996
it's

3954.4 --> 3959.359
the demonic

3955.839 --> 3962.48
the demonically possessed

3959.359 --> 3964.96
that is overpopulation because they do a

3962.48 --> 3968.559
lot of damage and they always grow worse

3964.96 --> 3970.559
and the next generations grow even worse

3968.559 --> 3973.039
that's the overpopulation that's the

3970.559 --> 3976.0
real problem

3973.039 --> 3978.3190000000004
is vacant people the zombie apocalypse

3976.0 --> 3980.4
that's not say apocalypse is even wrong

3978.319 --> 3984.16
it's

3980.4 --> 3986.7200000000003
a zombie demonic doom

3984.16 --> 3988.24
the apocalypse should be awakening you

3986.72 --> 3989.9199999999996
to that fact

3988.24 --> 3991.1189999999997
but yeah

3989.92 --> 3993.2000000000003
it's

3991.119 --> 3996.0
like the entire concept and the way

3993.2 --> 3998.319
propaganda about it spreads is demonic

3996.0 --> 4001.039
because the only ones that would

3998.319 --> 4002.72
actually be susceptible

4001.039 --> 4005.5200000000004
to it

4002.72 --> 4007.1189999999997
to propaganda of overpopulation is the

4005.52 --> 4009.7599999999998
good people

4007.119 --> 4011.76
that would just like i said like oh i

4009.76 --> 4014.88
want to help i want to help

4011.76 --> 4018.88
i'll just sacrifice myself for the good

4014.88 --> 4021.359
yeah and then the demon wins

4018.88 --> 4023.2000000000003
right because demons would never do that

4021.359 --> 4026.24
they would never buy into that they

4023.2 --> 4026.24
don't give a [ __ ]

4027.68 --> 4034.7599999999998
they just want to rule

4030.079 --> 4034.76
and have 10 their temporary pleasures

4036.48 --> 4041.76
right the real overpopulation problem is

4039.76 --> 4044.1600000000003
demonic

4041.76 --> 4046.88
not human beings

4044.16 --> 4047.7599999999998
not the human beings with the spirit of

4046.88 --> 4049.44
god

4047.76 --> 4050.3190000000004
that they're born with

4049.44 --> 4053.599
right

4050.319 --> 4055.599
it's the systematic ruining of people

4053.599 --> 4056.799
and their spirits starting at a young

4055.599 --> 4057.599
age

4056.799 --> 4060.64
that

4057.599 --> 4061.599
makes this demonic infestation

4060.64 --> 4064.319
grow

4061.599 --> 4067.119
and the demonic infestation is the thing

4064.319 --> 4069.52
that's actually destroying earth

4067.119 --> 4072.079
not the people not

4069.52 --> 4074.079
people with god's spirit inside of them

4072.079 --> 4076.559
it's the demonically possessed that are

4074.079 --> 4078.1600000000003
literally destroying earth

4076.559 --> 4082.6400000000003
their growth

4078.16 --> 4082.64
spells absolute doom and destruction

4082.72 --> 4086.8799999999997
where do these demons come from they

4084.72 --> 4088.9599999999996
come from the inside

4086.88 --> 4090.96
they come from weakness

4088.96 --> 4094.0
surrender to

4090.96 --> 4095.839
the extra dimensional demonic spirit

4094.0 --> 4097.52
to the invader

4095.839 --> 4100.48
the invader

4097.52 --> 4102.839000000001
that's also described as the angel from

4100.48 --> 4105.04
the heavens from the other dimension

4102.839 --> 4106.239
fallen and then

4105.04 --> 4107.92
jealous

4106.239 --> 4110.879999999999
of god's design

4107.92 --> 4113.759
of humanity to replace

4110.88 --> 4116.88
god's design to replace his spirit and

4113.759 --> 4118.88
to destroy and ruin it all

4116.88 --> 4122.08
that

4118.88 --> 4122.08
that's where they come from

4122.96 --> 4127.92
from the inside

4124.719 --> 4127.92
from the other dimension

4128.88 --> 4131.679
and

4129.679 --> 4133.52
yeah the only way it

4131.679 --> 4137.12
it can

4133.52 --> 4138.96
even perpetuate is through trauma is by

4137.12 --> 4141.199
damaging and

4138.96 --> 4144.4
creating delusions

4141.199 --> 4146.639999999999
and that way seducing

4144.4 --> 4148.879999999999
next generations that will then take it

4146.64 --> 4151.4400000000005
upon themselves and just be like yeah

4148.88 --> 4154.799
okay i hate everything now too

4151.44 --> 4156.639999999999
i will do as you do

4154.799 --> 4158.799
demon father

4156.64 --> 4161.839
that's what they that's how it works

4158.799 --> 4161.839
through trauma

4179.359 --> 4184.1990000000005
yeah godzilla it's a little bit weird

4221.04 --> 4225.6
oh you don't believe in it oh it's an

4223.6 --> 4228.719
excuse

4225.6 --> 4232.320000000001
oh really well hey you seem to be making

4228.719 --> 4233.28
up an excuse not to deal with it

4232.32 --> 4236.639999999999
right

4233.28 --> 4238.8
it's interesting projection there

4236.64 --> 4240.56
you don't believe it's just an excuse

4238.8 --> 4243.56
for human nature

4240.56 --> 4243.56
or

4244.159 --> 4248.96
you not dealing with it is your excuse

4249.44 --> 4254.639999999999
right because maybe they're part of

4251.52 --> 4256.88
human nature maybe they are actually the

4254.64 --> 4259.76
architects of your human nature have you

4256.88 --> 4261.6
ever considered that

4259.76 --> 4264.56
an opinion oh you can have all the

4261.6 --> 4266.8
opinions you like it's not gonna do

4264.56 --> 4267.6
anything though

4266.8 --> 4269.12
right

4267.6 --> 4271.360000000001
it's just funny that you say you don't

4269.12 --> 4273.599999999999
believe in it it's an excuse for human

4271.36 --> 4276.48
nature oh yeah so who are the architects

4273.6 --> 4276.4800000000005
of human nature

4276.8 --> 4279.84
still don't believe in it

4284.88 --> 4289.92
i mean you think human nature is just a

4287.04 --> 4292.64
random set of impulses

4289.92 --> 4295.36
then why is it so distinct

4292.64 --> 4298.159000000001
why are certain elements and traits so

4295.36 --> 4299.5199999999995
distinctly recognized as human and

4298.159 --> 4301.44
others as

4299.52 --> 4303.360000000001
demonic

4301.44 --> 4305.12
why would that be could that be because

4303.36 --> 4306.32
there is an order to it there is a

4305.12 --> 4308.48
design

4306.32 --> 4312.159
well if there is if there is a uniform

4308.48 --> 4313.919999999999
design that means there is a designer

4312.159 --> 4315.759999999999
and if there is a designer that means

4313.92 --> 4318.08
there is a game going on and that game

4315.76 --> 4319.52
is between the designer and his opponent

4318.08 --> 4321.199
god and satan

4319.52 --> 4322.64
so

4321.199 --> 4325.12
are you sure

4322.64 --> 4327.360000000001
you stand behind what you said

4325.12 --> 4330.88
or you just don't really want to think

4327.36 --> 4332.5599999999995
about it too deeply

4330.88 --> 4334.96
why insert god

4332.56 --> 4336.2390000000005
because it was designed you didn't

4334.96 --> 4339.12
design it

4336.239 --> 4340.48
lydia locks you did not design human

4339.12 --> 4345.12
nature

4340.48 --> 4345.12
human nature does not arrive randomly

4345.76 --> 4350.0
that's why i just explained why

4353.12 --> 4359.28
god is an inevitability because there is

4356.159 --> 4361.759999999999
a design there is an akashic library

4359.28 --> 4363.679
it didn't form itself things don't

4361.76 --> 4365.76
create themselves things don't design

4363.679 --> 4367.76
themselves they are designed and then

4365.76 --> 4369.04
they manifest in accordance to the

4367.76 --> 4371.360000000001
design

4369.04 --> 4374.159
it was designed by god because god is

4371.36 --> 4378.759999999999
the only concept we even have in order

4374.159 --> 4378.759999999999
to explain how everything is designed

4395.76 --> 4398.76
uh

4399.76 --> 4406.320000000001
it's not been yeah it is proven

4402.64 --> 4408.08
lydialogs it is proven i just laid it

4406.32 --> 4409.5199999999995
out for you

4408.08 --> 4412.48
it's designed

4409.52 --> 4415.040000000001
things don't design themselves

4412.48 --> 4418.799999999999
something designs it for them and then

4415.04 --> 4420.159
it manifests in accordance to the design

4418.8 --> 4422.88
that's not

4420.159 --> 4426.159
not been proven no that is the proof the

4422.88 --> 4429.28
proof is in the very essence in the very

4426.159 --> 4432.239
nature of it all

4429.28 --> 4435.44
it can only have been designed and

4432.239 --> 4437.678999999999
things cannot design themselves done

4435.44 --> 4440.08
that's the argument

4437.679 --> 4443.1990000000005
you could call it a law of nature

4440.08 --> 4443.199
because it kind of is

4443.2 --> 4446.34
[Music]

4447.12 --> 4452.26
the watchmaker argument

4449.28 --> 4456.009999999999
that's not an argument

4452.26 --> 4456.01
[Music]

4461.52 --> 4466.64
it is designed it has to be designed

4463.52 --> 4467.679
things don't design themselves

4466.64 --> 4471.76
yeah

4467.679 --> 4477.159
there can only be a designer for it

4471.76 --> 4477.159000000001
before it ensues into being

4490.8 --> 4497.679
says who says physical substance and

4493.84 --> 4499.04
reality in every conceivable essence of

4497.679 --> 4502.159
everything

4499.04 --> 4505.36
says that lydia logs everything says

4502.159 --> 4507.599999999999
that it's an absolute inevitability it

4505.36 --> 4509.44
is so inevitable it is the most

4507.6 --> 4511.280000000001
inevitable

4509.44 --> 4514.239
truth

4511.28 --> 4516.48
that has ever existed

4514.239 --> 4519.199
that's who says it

4516.48 --> 4523.5199999999995
it can only be

4519.199 --> 4526.799999999999
there is no other conceivable way

4523.52 --> 4528.719
yeah and guess what people have had

4526.8 --> 4531.52
thousands of year

4528.719 --> 4535.8
years to try and conceive of that other

4531.52 --> 4535.8
way there isn't any

4541.52 --> 4544.159000000001
so prove it

4542.8 --> 4548.28
you exist

4544.159 --> 4548.28
there you go that's the proof

4552.56 --> 4560.0
existence is proof of a designer

4556.96 --> 4560.0
this is just a fact

4562.0 --> 4567.28
right you can try to philosophize your

4565.76 --> 4570.320000000001
way through

4567.28 --> 4572.4
into oh but maybe no maybe it wasn't the

4570.32 --> 4573.599999999999
design oh yeah yeah the people have

4572.4 --> 4577.36
attempted that

4573.6 --> 4579.280000000001
yeah quite a while it doesn't work it

4577.36 --> 4582.32
always breaks

4579.28 --> 4584.5599999999995
it always breaks there is no logical

4582.32 --> 4588.159
reasoning

4584.56 --> 4590.64
that can bypass the absolute realization

4588.159 --> 4594.639999999999
that everything is designed

4590.64 --> 4597.92
it exists so it is designed there is no

4594.64 --> 4601.1990000000005
other option available and people have

4597.92 --> 4603.4400000000005
had thousands of years to find those of

4601.199 --> 4605.28
other available options none of them

4603.44 --> 4608.879999999999
work they all

4605.28 --> 4611.4
go into a dead end every single time no

[Music]

4614.159 --> 4619.599999999999
why can't god create a big bang because

4616.719 --> 4619.6
that's nonsense

4620.32 --> 4624.4
you can't

4621.52 --> 4627.1990000000005
create things that can't exist

4624.4 --> 4627.199
that don't work

4627.6 --> 4633.04
god cannot

4628.96 --> 4635.44
design everything to come from nothing

4633.04 --> 4636.96
you will have to have designed it piece

4635.44 --> 4641.199
by piece

4636.96 --> 4644.4800000000005
and then put it into functioning

4641.199 --> 4647.04
god cannot just like make impossible

4644.48 --> 4648.639999999999
things happen right now it can make

4647.04 --> 4649.44
things happen

4648.64 --> 4650.56
that

4649.44 --> 4652.799999999999
you

4650.56 --> 4655.120000000001
would not have conceived of that might

4652.8 --> 4657.4400000000005
seem magical to you but it can't do

4655.12 --> 4659.76
things that are physically impossible

4657.44 --> 4663.12
because they're physically impossible

4659.76 --> 4665.04
and the physical laws are the laws he

4663.12 --> 4667.76
put there into place

4665.04 --> 4671.5199999999995
and he's not going to violate his own

4667.76 --> 4674.64
designing rules it makes no sense he

4671.52 --> 4674.64
wouldn't be able to

4676.4 --> 4680.239
god can do anything no he can't

4680.88 --> 4687.4400000000005
i mean well he could but that would

4683.44 --> 4687.44
take away the point of existence

4688.159 --> 4695.12
the whole existence is

4690.84 --> 4699.8
there to test his design if he just

4695.12 --> 4699.8
ruined it then what's the point

4704.17 --> 4707.2390000000005
[Music]

4716.88 --> 4721.4400000000005
there's no point in making physically

4719.36 --> 4724.639999999999
impossible things happen

4721.44 --> 4727.28
for god either it's possible

4724.64 --> 4729.280000000001
or it isn't

4727.28 --> 4732.28
it's all the design everything is the

4729.28 --> 4732.28
design

4753.92 --> 4759.679
no it didn't akuma virus

4757.76 --> 4762.2390000000005
no

4759.679 --> 4764.8
it's a concept it only exists in our

4762.239 --> 4767.759999999999
imagination our imaginations are the

4764.8 --> 4770.64
realm of satan not god

4767.76 --> 4774.76
just because you can imagine it somehow

4770.64 --> 4774.76
doesn't mean that's real

4776.48 --> 4780.0
in the imagination anything can be made

4778.96 --> 4782.4
to work

4780.0 --> 4784.4
just through sheer ignorance anything

4782.4 --> 4786.799999999999
can seem to make sense in your

4784.4 --> 4788.48
imagination

4786.8 --> 4790.159000000001
but it doesn't make it physically

4788.48 --> 4792.4
possible

4790.159 --> 4794.5599999999995
just because you can imagine it doesn't

4792.4 --> 4798.04
mean that god can make it in the

4794.56 --> 4798.04
physical reality

4806.48 --> 4810.5599999999995
that goes both ways

4808.4 --> 4810.5599999999995
no

4810.96 --> 4816.719
just because you can imagine it doesn't

4814.0 --> 4819.04
make it automatically possible for god

4816.719 --> 4821.76
to make it in the physical world

4819.04 --> 4824.76
that doesn't go both ways it's just one

4821.76 --> 4824.76
way

4837.76 --> 4842.4800000000005
say the same about yeah but the earth is

4839.76 --> 4845.4400000000005
actually flat

4842.48 --> 4846.48
right it's not a model in our minds that

4845.44 --> 4848.48
we see

4846.48 --> 4851.678999999999
and repeal ourselves to it's the

4848.48 --> 4853.919999999999
physical measured world around us

4851.679 --> 4856.4800000000005
that is the example

4853.92 --> 4858.719
yeah physical world around us not

4856.48 --> 4861.919999999999
imagination that's the realm of god

4858.719 --> 4864.96
that's his design it is flat it's

4861.92 --> 4864.96
measurable flat

4866.96 --> 4871.84
just because we can imagine something

4869.44 --> 4873.678999999999
about the physical real world in our

4871.84 --> 4877.4400000000005
minds

4873.679 --> 4878.96
does not undo the physical reality

4877.44 --> 4883.48
that's ridiculous

doesn't go both ways akuma virus

[Music]

4896.0 --> 4899.84
it isn't flat for you yeah that's

4897.6 --> 4904.639
because you live in your imagination

4899.84 --> 4908.2390000000005
because you're a numpty akumu that's why

4904.639 --> 4911.1990000000005
yeah you can be a numpty you can

4908.239 --> 4913.44
live inside your head

4911.199 --> 4914.839999999999
where it cannot be flat that's your

4913.44 --> 4917.04
[ __ ] problem

4914.84 --> 4920.56
dude yeah you don't care about

imagination you're living it

4921.76 --> 4925.2390000000005
back in two minutes

hello andy hold my beer

5029.44 --> 5032.719
rubber ditch though

5031.84 --> 5035.04
yeah

5032.719 --> 5036.96
for those not even know there's no live

5035.04 --> 5039.199
flat earth debates

5036.96 --> 5042.199
so i'm just gonna continue my show for a

5039.199 --> 5042.199
while

5044.48 --> 5050.919999999999
though i'm getting hungry

5047.12 --> 5050.92
so not too long

5076.4 --> 5078.638999999999
this

5083.44 --> 5088.4
that's just silly

5085.6 --> 5091.120000000001
dave johnson come on really what would

5088.4 --> 5094.32
pull matter into a flat disc yeah it's

5091.12 --> 5098.32
not in outer space it didn't form

5094.32 --> 5100.96
through back bang dust

5098.32 --> 5105.36
it's just a realm it's a

5100.96 --> 5108.8
spatial confine looping potentially

5105.36 --> 5113.719
it's a manifestation of the 3d physical

5108.8 --> 5113.719
reality in in a matrix

5114.32 --> 5119.04
it's like a

5116.48 --> 5122.5599999999995
physical projection

5119.04 --> 5125.199
that exists in nothing

5122.56 --> 5127.280000000001
like the physical space in which the

5125.199 --> 5129.919999999999
matter is is the only

5127.28 --> 5132.159
physical space

5129.92 --> 5135.6
understand that's the only place where

5132.159 --> 5137.759999999999
there is room where there is volume

5135.6 --> 5139.120000000001
where there is matter outside of that

5137.76 --> 5140.56
volume

5139.12 --> 5144.48
nothing

5140.56 --> 5146.96
not emptiness nothing there is no space

5144.48 --> 5148.718999999999
there is nothing there is no room there

5146.96 --> 5151.76
isn't anything

5148.719 --> 5154.639
physical things physical room physical

5151.76 --> 5158.88
reality does not exist outside of the

5154.639 --> 5158.88
spatial confine of our realm

5160.32 --> 5167.28
it doesn't form the disk it is in the

5163.6 --> 5171.6
disk it didn't form by gathering like

5167.28 --> 5171.599999999999
dust in a heliocentric model

5172.239 --> 5178.4
it was manifested programmed you could

5175.199 --> 5180.879999999999
say like a simulation right

5178.4 --> 5183.36
when you're making a game world

5180.88 --> 5186.8
you don't have to like

5183.36 --> 5188.639
let it naturally form

5186.8 --> 5190.4800000000005
like a big bang you don't have to do

5188.639 --> 5193.36
that as a programmer you just have to

5190.48 --> 5196.36
set the parameters and then initiate the

5193.36 --> 5196.36
simulation

5198.96 --> 5201.92
don't you get that

5204.88 --> 5208.84
the entire

5206.32 --> 5212.4
big bang idea

5208.84 --> 5215.92
formation all this astronomical [ __ ]

5212.4 --> 5218.0
is fantasy it's a fantasy story

5215.92 --> 5222.12
doesn't work like that nothing works

5218.0 --> 5222.12
like that it's pure fantasy

5225.92 --> 5230.639
could there be other realms outside of

5228.08 --> 5230.639
our realm

5231.76 --> 5239.12
i doubt it i don't think so

5235.84 --> 5241.12
i think there's one central realm

5239.12 --> 5243.04
and that's this there might be other

5241.12 --> 5245.36
segments

5243.04 --> 5247.84
it's like realm adjacent but they are

5245.36 --> 5249.679
not their own self-sufficient things

5247.84 --> 5252.719
they are side

5249.679 --> 5257.84
segments of this

5252.719 --> 5257.84
we are the center of physical existence

5262.239 --> 5267.919999999999
but yeah how big is that how big is that

5265.36 --> 5270.0
room i don't know but i know it has a

5267.92 --> 5272.4800000000005
limited volume

5270.0 --> 5273.36
and it is not endless

5272.48 --> 5277.0
because

5273.36 --> 5277.0
yeah because of that

5280.56 --> 5285.1990000000005
so who knows how much space there is in

5282.8 --> 5285.1990000000005
total

5286.48 --> 5291.759999999999
and yeah maybe they've already argued

5289.28 --> 5293.36
through non-special non-linearity maybe

5291.76 --> 5295.84
there are like

5293.36 --> 5295.839999999999
segments

5296.719 --> 5303.28
around that are

5298.639 --> 5304.56
like spatially disconnected they're like

5303.28 --> 5307.199
a balloon

5304.56 --> 5309.679
twisted into a knot so it becomes two

5307.199 --> 5312.32
little balloons right by the twist

5309.679 --> 5315.04
so the two different volumes they

5312.32 --> 5317.28
connect but you can't reach the other

5315.04 --> 5319.199
side right

5317.28 --> 5321.5199999999995
and then maybe it could be unwound and

5319.199 --> 5323.599999999999
then bloop it becomes one again right

5321.52 --> 5326.080000000001
that's

5323.6 --> 5328.159000000001
how i reason out it could be but i'm

5326.08 --> 5331.12
pretty sure that this place that we're

5328.159 --> 5332.239
standing here is like the most central

5331.12 --> 5334.84
part

5332.239 --> 5339.199
in a significant

5334.84 --> 5341.84
way we are not some side realm to

5339.199 --> 5345.638999999999
something much bigger and more important

5341.84 --> 5345.639
pretty sure we're not

5359.679 --> 5364.4800000000005
when those star brights that's light in

5362.32 --> 5367.759999999999
the sky they're all holographic there is

5364.48 --> 5370.959999999999
no physical other places

5367.76 --> 5374.719
that's yet again another

5370.96 --> 5377.28
campfire story that's been told

5374.719 --> 5378.96
over the ages

5377.28 --> 5381.599999999999
through

5378.96 --> 5382.96
yeah through verbal tradition

5381.6 --> 5385.360000000001
it's a spell

5382.96 --> 5388.0
it's a fantasy

5385.36 --> 5390.5599999999995
it's making you imagine like those are

5388.0 --> 5393.6
actual physical places they are not it's

5390.56 --> 5396.400000000001
just light light manifest it's

5393.6 --> 5399.120000000001
holographic it's a hologram

5396.4 --> 5400.48
they're not places you can't

5399.12 --> 5401.92
go there

5400.48 --> 5404.879999999999
physically

5401.92 --> 5407.1990000000005
you can't even make the light that you

5404.88 --> 5409.52
see in those stars you can even make

5407.199 --> 5410.638999999999
their angular size increase with

5409.52 --> 5412.400000000001
approach

5410.639 --> 5414.56
nothing

5412.4 --> 5416.5599999999995
they're light manifest they're part of

5414.56 --> 5419.1990000000005
the sky clock

5416.56 --> 5422.639
and they're part of well what feeds the

5419.199 --> 5424.5599999999995
life light is a key component it seems

5422.639 --> 5425.679
through the sun

5424.56 --> 5426.8
to

5425.679 --> 5431.4400000000005
make

5426.8 --> 5431.4400000000005
life the life processes work as they do

5432.639 --> 5437.28
it's not light coming from a lamp that

5435.6 --> 5439.84
we make though

5437.28 --> 5443.92
it's literally light manifest it's right

5439.84 --> 5445.28
there it manifests in cyclical fashion

5443.92 --> 5446.56
and we see

5445.28 --> 5449.5199999999995
it

5446.56 --> 5450.96
angular wise and that's it

5449.52 --> 5455.120000000001
it's not coming from anywhere it's

5450.96 --> 5455.12
manifesting it's part of the design

5455.28 --> 5459.759999999999
and whatever you imagine

5457.52 --> 5461.040000000001
or have been told to imagine those

5459.76 --> 5463.12
things are

5461.04 --> 5465.92
that there's this infinite volume in it

5463.12 --> 5468.48
all those little tiny pricks of light

5465.92 --> 5470.8
they're just like the sun and the sun is

5468.48 --> 5473.36
very giant too so you can imagine how

5470.8 --> 5475.84
the earth is so insignificantly small

5473.36 --> 5477.92
inside of an endless

5475.84 --> 5483.28
amount of room with endless amount of

5477.92 --> 5485.76
surface land and all that's pure fantasy

5483.28 --> 5487.679
pure fantasy

5485.76 --> 5489.679
nobody went to the moon it's not a place

5487.679 --> 5493.04
you can land on

5489.679 --> 5494.08
it's not a physical place

5493.04 --> 5496.88
yeah

5494.08 --> 5498.5599999999995
you can't go to space it's not a medium

5496.88 --> 5502.2390000000005
that can exist

5498.56 --> 5505.52
you definitely do not have a flea free

5502.239 --> 5506.799999999999
floaty place there is no free floaty

5505.52 --> 5509.4400000000005
place

5506.8 --> 5509.4400000000005
you understand

5509.6 --> 5512.8
everything

5510.719 --> 5515.76
in the realm is subjected to relative

5512.8 --> 5517.12
density everything falls that is denser

5515.76 --> 5519.1990000000005
than the medium

5517.12 --> 5521.679
everything a sense that is less dense

5519.199 --> 5524.159
than the medium and that's just the way

5521.679 --> 5526.4800000000005
it works there's no exception to that

5524.159 --> 5528.799999999999
that has been discovered

5526.48 --> 5531.44
that has actually been discovered beyond

5528.8 --> 5534.08
rumors and beyond calculated based

5531.44 --> 5534.08
assumptions

5535.04 --> 5540.92
this is the place we got

5537.44 --> 5540.919999999999
and it's flat

5554.48 --> 5557.48
ah

5570.159 --> 5575.04
right but again yeah all these ideas

5572.88 --> 5577.1990000000005
that come through heliocentrism they're

5575.04 --> 5580.48
all very inspiring right

5577.199 --> 5582.08
i love sci-fi movies i'm looking forward

5580.48 --> 5583.44
to

5582.08 --> 5585.84
what is it

5583.44 --> 5588.239
the new movie moonfall it's going to be

5585.84 --> 5590.4800000000005
kind of ridiculous but i'm still looking

5588.239 --> 5592.239
forward to it because i love

5590.48 --> 5594.638999999999
imagining

5592.239 --> 5596.638999999999
like i was an astronaut in like a

5594.639 --> 5598.0
supposed space suit although i don't

5596.639 --> 5599.76
want to think about it in too much

5598.0 --> 5601.36
detail because then it becomes kind of

5599.76 --> 5604.08
insane

5601.36 --> 5606.08
but the fantasy about it works for me i

5604.08 --> 5606.96
love scenes where there's like oh we

5606.08 --> 5608.96
have to

5606.96 --> 5611.36
get out on the spaceship and repair

5608.96 --> 5614.4800000000005
something or we have to change modify

5611.36 --> 5617.92
this or we can't contact the base

5614.48 --> 5621.5199999999995
i love that [ __ ] i love it i love the

5617.92 --> 5624.0
fantasy but i know it's fantasy that can

5621.52 --> 5627.84
never be physical reality it's always in

5624.0 --> 5631.84
our imagination and it never will live

5627.84 --> 5631.84
beyond those borders

5635.84 --> 5640.96
the sun being a hologram is just a

5638.239 --> 5640.959999999999
theory though

5641.52 --> 5646.719
you could think of it as a theory i mean

5648.4 --> 5651.679
yeah it's

5650.32 --> 5654.639
it's kind of a

5651.679 --> 5658.4800000000005
bit of a conundrum i hope not a paradox

5654.639 --> 5660.88
to you know to be able to prove that

5658.48 --> 5661.839999999999
but i can certainly

5660.88 --> 5663.52
like

5661.84 --> 5665.04
exclude

5663.52 --> 5667.4400000000005
a physical

5665.04 --> 5668.239
object-based nature though

5667.44 --> 5671.5199999999995
right

5668.239 --> 5675.599999999999
i can certainly disprove tangibility or

5671.52 --> 5678.159000000001
even locality i can disprove that

5675.6 --> 5680.8
and then to me the only

5678.159 --> 5682.48
available option for the phenomenon

5680.8 --> 5686.320000000001
which it is

5682.48 --> 5688.32
would be a hologram holographic i i'm

5686.32 --> 5692.5599999999995
just trying

5688.32 --> 5695.44
to work with the remaining data

5692.56 --> 5697.92
and that makes me declare it hologram i

5695.44 --> 5700.48
don't have any other options left

5697.92 --> 5703.04
except for i'm just gonna not talk about

5700.48 --> 5704.239
it because i don't have the scientific

5703.04 --> 5705.28
evidence

5704.239 --> 5707.919999999999
whatever

5705.28 --> 5709.44
i like to figure things out especially

5707.92 --> 5711.52
things that are

5709.44 --> 5715.04
almost impossible

5711.52 --> 5719.080000000001
and that everybody walks away from

5715.04 --> 5719.08
that's what i like to do

5730.32 --> 5735.04
eat from a hologram yeah yeah heat from

5733.04 --> 5739.119
a hologram you can get a tan from a

5735.04 --> 5739.119
hologram that's right dave johnson

5739.76 --> 5744.4800000000005
do you have a memory

5741.52 --> 5747.119000000001
any of you have memories

5744.48 --> 5748.718999999999
i named a show after that it's not even

5747.119 --> 5751.759999999999
two weeks ago

5748.719 --> 5752.8
yeah you can get a tan from a hologram

5751.76 --> 5756.400000000001
yeah

5752.8 --> 5757.6
make a hologram generator output a lot

5756.4 --> 5759.839999999999
of light

5757.6 --> 5762.639
maybe you could even like use certain

5759.84 --> 5766.0
types of lamps

5762.639 --> 5768.56
right that would insert more

5766.0 --> 5770.32
infrared light into the hologram and

5768.56 --> 5773.280000000001
then yeah even though you're not

5770.32 --> 5775.679
literally being exposed directly by

5773.28 --> 5778.88
the hologram projectors yeah because we

5775.679 --> 5780.2390000000005
can only make holograms with man-made

5778.88 --> 5782.0
devices

5780.239 --> 5784.959999999999
with projectors right

5782.0 --> 5787.28
but then as they project into the

5784.96 --> 5789.84
crystal or whatever it is the hall of

5787.28 --> 5792.32
mirrors that creates the hologram

5789.84 --> 5795.28
then you see the hologram

5792.32 --> 5798.159
and if you stand kind of close it'll

5795.28 --> 5799.44
seem closer to you also you stand there

5798.159 --> 5802.08
long enough

5799.44 --> 5803.119
yeah that light is going to give you a

5802.08 --> 5804.239
tan

5803.119 --> 5805.92
yeah

5804.239 --> 5807.759999999999
the hologram

5805.92 --> 5810.32
gives off light that's why you see it

5807.76 --> 5813.6
that light reaches your eye you register

5810.32 --> 5816.799999999999
it but it can also reach your skin and

5813.6 --> 5818.0
then your skin absorbs it transforms it

5816.8 --> 5820.639
into heat

5818.0 --> 5823.199
and yeah if there's like ultraviolet in

5820.639 --> 5824.2390000000005
there even then you might even get a tan

5823.199 --> 5828.638999999999
from it

5824.239 --> 5832.08
right just like the sun so yeah

5828.639 --> 5832.08
yeah that's right

5838.56 --> 5844.8
how does that work on fe well it has no

5841.6 --> 5847.119000000001
absolutely no relation to the geometric

5844.8 --> 5850.2390000000005
nature of the earth's surface

5847.119 --> 5850.239
that's what you're asking

5850.719 --> 5855.28
right

5852.84 --> 5856.32
hologram like it doesn't matter what the

5855.28 --> 5857.84
earth is

5856.32 --> 5860.239
this is not about the earth this is

5857.84 --> 5862.56
about the light

5860.239 --> 5865.04
the celestials celestials are not

5862.56 --> 5868.56
earthly it's a distinct difference

5865.04 --> 5870.4
it doesn't matter what the earth is

5868.56 --> 5873.76
in order to figure out what the

5870.4 --> 5873.759999999999
celestial lights are

5877.119 --> 5881.759999999999
why do you block me

5879.92 --> 5884.639
dude what blocking what are you

5881.76 --> 5884.639
blabbering about

5885.36 --> 5888.159
you're right there

5888.239 --> 5891.44
right

5890.0 --> 5895.6
i mean

5891.44 --> 5899.879999999999
literally like look you're in

5895.6 --> 5899.88
message retracted okay

5911.52 --> 5914.56
right fine

5916.159 --> 5921.5599999999995
would that be

5917.84 --> 5921.56
premature there

5927.6 --> 5931.1990000000005
huh yeah that's a good one ralph

5928.8 --> 5932.56
rodriguez high altitude sunset that's

5931.199 --> 5935.199
right

5932.56 --> 5935.1990000000005
that's right

5936.8 --> 5939.84
i'd like to see that

5952.719 --> 5955.04
what

5958.4 --> 5962.879999999999
i have no idea what you're talking about

5960.239 --> 5965.879999999999
steamy traveler that sounds absolutely

5962.88 --> 5965.88
disgusting

5968.239 --> 5975.32
although look if they can reassemble

5970.88 --> 5975.32
that bridge afterward that's fine

5983.6 --> 5988.1990000000005
oh wait that thing

5985.199 --> 5988.199
right

6003.04 --> 6008.719
that's a ridiculous boat

6006.0 --> 6012.56
and like dude we don't want you here

6008.719 --> 6016.8
jeff bezos why don't you [ __ ] off

6012.56 --> 6020.639
we don't want your disgusting globalist

6016.8 --> 6024.92
piece of [ __ ] ugly face here jeff bezos

6020.639 --> 6024.92
get the [ __ ] out of the netherlands

6080.159 --> 6082.5599999999995
right

6089.04 --> 6092.239
yeah

6089.92 --> 6094.159
but anyway that

6092.239 --> 6095.839999999999
that that bridge thing

6094.159 --> 6098.239
it is historic

6095.84 --> 6101.119000000001
it's true but it's also

6098.239 --> 6102.239
it's not the most beautiful building

6101.119 --> 6103.92
ever

6102.239 --> 6106.799999999999
thing you know it's

6103.92 --> 6110.4800000000005
it's interesting because it does show

6106.8 --> 6113.04
like the industry of a certain era

6110.48 --> 6115.599999999999
like the steel era and that's why it's

6113.04 --> 6117.76
interesting it's just

6115.6 --> 6119.360000000001
it's not really the most beautiful

6117.76 --> 6121.92
sighting ever

6119.36 --> 6124.48
but as long as they don't just like

6121.92 --> 6128.119
wreck it or something

6124.48 --> 6128.119
i don't see the problem

6145.119 --> 6150.719
no net worth yeah i don't give a [ __ ]

6147.52 --> 6152.8
dude i just dude i just want him to die

6150.719 --> 6156.32
just [ __ ] off

6152.8 --> 6159.119000000001
get out get out of the world [ __ ] off

6156.32 --> 6160.88
you're disgusting [ __ ] off demon we are

6159.119 --> 6163.119
disgusting we don't want you i don't

6160.88 --> 6166.32
care how much [ __ ] money you have

6163.119 --> 6168.639
i hate your business i hate what you do

6166.32 --> 6170.88
you abuse everyone and everything you're

6168.639 --> 6173.76
a disgusting demon

6170.88 --> 6176.4800000000005
but you take that [ __ ] money and

6173.76 --> 6178.88
choke on it i mean it

6176.48 --> 6181.28
choke on it choke on your money i don't

6178.88 --> 6184.96
[ __ ] care how much you have [ __ ] off

6181.28 --> 6188.84
you filthy disgusting slave driving

6184.96 --> 6188.84
piece of [ __ ] demon

6195.9 --> 6199.089999999999
[Music]

6319.92 --> 6323.84
right

6320.96 --> 6326.2390000000005
so about that bridge again i'm reading

6323.84 --> 6329.28
up on the article and there's been

6326.239 --> 6331.44
objection of course

6329.28 --> 6335.36
but yeah that thing you know

6331.44 --> 6337.759999999999
they would be wise to basically

6335.36 --> 6340.08
modify if it is going to be a monument

6337.76 --> 6342.88
right and i agree with that

6340.08 --> 6344.5599999999995
they should modify it slightly

6342.88 --> 6347.84
it's going to be tricky

6344.56 --> 6350.0
so that it can actually be easily

6347.84 --> 6352.2390000000005
dismantled

6350.0 --> 6354.4
and put back together again right to

6352.239 --> 6356.48
almost make it like a big bridge lego

6354.4 --> 6359.199
set or something

6356.48 --> 6361.28
if that's possible because i'm pretty

6359.199 --> 6363.678999999999
damn sure in the future it's probably

6361.28 --> 6365.36
going to happen again

6363.679 --> 6367.6
it's like uh

6365.36 --> 6370.08
we have another mecca yacht

6367.6 --> 6371.4400000000005
oh what do we do oh we have to dismantle

6370.08 --> 6372.4
like no

6371.44 --> 6374.879999999999
just

6372.4 --> 6377.28
modify it slightly so it is actually

6374.88 --> 6378.400000000001
very easy to dismantle and get out of

6377.28 --> 6381.04
the way

6378.4 --> 6383.28
without a lot of cost every time that's

6381.04 --> 6386.92
what i would recommend really just being

6383.28 --> 6386.92
pragmatic here

6390.48 --> 6396.28
cost some time

6392.719 --> 6396.28
i am kinda hungry

6423.199 --> 6427.36
high energy laser weapon systems are

6425.44 --> 6430.638999999999
real yeah sure

6427.36 --> 6434.159
but they're probably not as effective as

6430.639 --> 6436.8
as like they are in movies

6434.159 --> 6436.799999999999
but yeah

6440.159 --> 6446.08
i'm pretty sure

6443.6 --> 6447.679
i am still expecting within my lifetime

6446.08 --> 6452.48
to have like a

6447.679 --> 6452.4800000000005
laser gun type transition happening

6452.639 --> 6456.400000000001
yeah at least that's what happened in my

6454.56 --> 6458.2390000000005
visions now whether that was real again

6456.4 --> 6460.0
or they're just [ __ ] with me as

6458.239 --> 6463.44
always i don't know

6460.0 --> 6463.44
but i'm kind of expecting

6463.76 --> 6466.719
that to happen

6466.8 --> 6471.92
if there's gonna be like an actual

6469.28 --> 6475.04
hot war of some kind on a bigger scale

6471.92 --> 6478.8
then we will see laser weaponry

6475.04 --> 6478.8
damn well better believe it

6483.04 --> 6486.48
and they're already being utilized as

6484.719 --> 6488.639
like anti-missile

6486.48 --> 6488.638999999999
so

6488.8 --> 6493.4400000000005
that's that is real

6491.52 --> 6494.080000000001
right you have the cars with lasers on

6493.44 --> 6496.839999999999
them

6494.08 --> 6499.84
and they literally just like beam

6496.84 --> 6501.679
rockets out of the sky although i don't

6499.84 --> 6505.4400000000005
know if they work on like hypersonic

6501.679 --> 6509.36
missiles but yeah that's so

6505.44 --> 6512.239
military tactical developments etc etc

6509.36 --> 6513.36
but yeah laser weaponry that's that

6512.239 --> 6516.0
exists

6513.36 --> 6516.0
absolutely

6521.44 --> 6525.599999999999
yes

6522.32 --> 6527.679
flatter sage yeah but that's directed

6525.6 --> 6530.719
energy weapons that's not laser

6527.679 --> 6533.76
that's more like radio

6530.719 --> 6538.159
it's weaponized radio pretty much

6533.76 --> 6538.159000000001
right so it's not like light based

6538.56 --> 6542.400000000001
well it is it's yeah it's on the

6540.8 --> 6544.320000000001
spectrum but it's

6542.4 --> 6548.159
different

6544.32 --> 6548.159
it's more like a microwave gun

6552.32 --> 6555.84
what other visions do you have about

6553.84 --> 6557.599
future technology

6555.84 --> 6560.88
well uh

6557.599 --> 6562.639
holographic 3d screens

6560.88 --> 6565.04
it's kind of funny though that we see

6562.639 --> 6566.96
that in movies a lot more regularly

6565.04 --> 6570.96
sci-fi movies

6566.96 --> 6570.96
but i'm kind of expecting that to happen

6575.599 --> 6580.32
if chess base of the hip up we review k

6579.52 --> 6581.76
um

6580.32 --> 6583.759999999999
do

6581.76 --> 6585.76
would i refuse it

6583.76 --> 6587.52
well if he's just giving it to me

6585.76 --> 6589.1990000000005
unconditionally i'm not going to refuse

6587.52 --> 6591.040000000001
it

6589.199 --> 6593.44
right although i don't see him doing

6591.04 --> 6595.36
that because he's a stinky

6593.44 --> 6597.919999999999
dirty little grabbler

6595.36 --> 6600.639
he doesn't just give away money without

6597.92 --> 6600.639
some price

6603.36 --> 6607.04
so

6604.239 --> 6609.36
yeah dude i'll accept money it's just

6607.04 --> 6611.36
going to be unconditional if he if jeff

6609.36 --> 6615.199
bezos wants to give me unconditional

6611.36 --> 6615.199
money i'll take it sure

6615.28 --> 6620.119
i'm not gonna do anything for it though

6630.159 --> 6634.679
like why the hell would he do that

6655.119 --> 6659.719
okay elite who are you talking about

6686.08 --> 6690.5599999999995
maybe jesus is a fan of flutter the

6688.32 --> 6692.239
early word maybe he is

6690.56 --> 6694.56
i don't know i don't understand these

6692.239 --> 6696.5599999999995
people man maybe he likes it when people

6694.56 --> 6699.119000000001
just call him exactly what it is like a

6696.56 --> 6701.4400000000005
disgusting little demon grabbler right

6699.119 --> 6703.28
maybe he likes it when people

6701.44 --> 6705.28
are not afraid to just call him for what

6703.28 --> 6708.159
he is and that would maybe make him a

6705.28 --> 6710.48
fan of my show who knows i don't really

6708.159 --> 6710.48
care

6710.719 --> 6714.4800000000005
i don't think he's gonna give me money

6712.32 --> 6717.84
so why would i try to focus on that it's

6714.48 --> 6717.839999999999
kind of a waste of my energy

6720.239 --> 6724.0
the top youtuber in the world is mr

6723.04 --> 6726.48
beast

6724.0 --> 6726.48
okay

6728.159 --> 6731.4
all right

6744.639 --> 6751.8
yeah at least you that that just sounds

6746.8 --> 6751.8
like a banking operation to me

6752.239 --> 6757.119
i don't trust that at all

6754.32 --> 6760.759999999999
any rich people i admire

6757.119 --> 6760.759999999999
no not really

6771.76 --> 6777.04
i mean every time i try

6774.32 --> 6778.96
to find admiration for some kind of a

6777.04 --> 6781.599
rich person

6778.96 --> 6784.8
always turns out that

6781.599 --> 6787.04
like oh i fell for it again no he's rich

6784.8 --> 6789.679
of course he's a disgusting piece of

6787.04 --> 6792.239
[ __ ] that's the only way you can be rich

6789.679 --> 6794.0
and stay rich is by being a disgusting

6792.239 --> 6796.959999999999
piece of [ __ ]

6794.0 --> 6796.96
so yeah

6797.04 --> 6801.44
i have fallen for the trap in the past

6799.679 --> 6804.0
believing that somebody that was

6801.44 --> 6806.48
potentially rich was cool

6804.0 --> 6807.84
and then it always turns like

6806.48 --> 6808.718999999999
yeah

6807.84 --> 6812.8
no

6808.719 --> 6812.8
that's not how that works unfortunately

6813.679 --> 6818.88
right where's the saying goes

6817.04 --> 6821.36
it's more likely

6818.88 --> 6822.2390000000005
to fit a camel through the needle of an

6821.36 --> 6824.639
eye

6822.239 --> 6826.4
than for a rich person to enter heaven

6824.639 --> 6829.599
right

6826.4 --> 6830.5599999999995
that that's actually

6829.599 --> 6835.400000000001
like

6830.56 --> 6835.400000000001
a very inflexible saying

6836.4 --> 6839.598999999999
because they can't help themselves they

6837.84 --> 6841.52
got all the money they will be

6839.599 --> 6844.2390000000005
disgusting and they will have to be

6841.52 --> 6846.2390000000005
disgusting to keep it

6844.239 --> 6849.839999999999
otherwise she can't have it it just

6846.239 --> 6849.839999999999
doesn't work that way

6850.159 --> 6854.48
that's also part of why i'm very not

6853.28 --> 6856.719
eager

6854.48 --> 6860.32
what about william yeah he's disgusting

6856.719 --> 6862.56
too yeah i fell for it i know

6860.32 --> 6864.88
i had a vision

6862.56 --> 6865.76
in relation to him

6864.88 --> 6868.4800000000005
but

6865.76 --> 6872.119000000001
it's just gross

6868.48 --> 6872.119
i'm really disappointed

6882.98 --> 6886.879999999999
[Music]

6884.48 --> 6888.5599999999995
if you say over a million is rich no no

6886.88 --> 6890.08
over a million is not richard kumar

6888.56 --> 6894.080000000001
virus

6890.08 --> 6894.08
that's barely even middle class

6895.679 --> 6899.84
but yeah

6897.599 --> 6904.04
somebody like you would say that that is

6899.84 --> 6904.04
rich of course you would

6910.8 --> 6916.719
would i take money from a demon then hey

6913.28 --> 6919.199
why do you keep asking [ __ ]

6916.719 --> 6921.119
why do you keep whining about that

6919.199 --> 6923.598999999999
are you a demon and you want to give me

6921.119 --> 6926.639
money just [ __ ] do it already

6923.599 --> 6929.28
why don't you stop asking that [ __ ] yeah

6926.639 --> 6932.639
i don't sign contracts with demons i

6929.28 --> 6935.199
don't take large amounts of money under

6932.639 --> 6937.76
contract or under condition

6935.199 --> 6942.0
that's my policy

6937.76 --> 6942.0
yeah so i don't care where it came from

6942.4 --> 6947.28
well i do care i mean i do care about

6944.88 --> 6949.1990000000005
the people that are

6947.28 --> 6952.48
like following my show that actually

6949.199 --> 6954.5599999999995
support me keep me going

6952.48 --> 6957.199
and i like it when i get money from

6954.56 --> 6960.96
people that i like and respect and i

6957.199 --> 6963.678999999999
think they're cool and promising etc

6960.96 --> 6963.679
but yeah

6963.84 --> 6968.8
would i like would i do something that

6966.8 --> 6971.360000000001
will never ever happen

6968.8 --> 6973.28
yeah well maybe i would do something

6971.36 --> 6975.36
that'll never ever happen why do you

6973.28 --> 6976.4
keep asking that

6975.36 --> 6978.0
yeah

6976.4 --> 6980.32
it's not gonna happen

6978.0 --> 6983.52
don't you understand that it's not gonna

6980.32 --> 6986.08
happen demons don't give away money for

6983.52 --> 6987.679
free they never do

6986.08 --> 6988.88
if you think that you're a [ __ ]

6987.679 --> 6991.76
[ __ ]

6988.88 --> 6993.04
they never do that ever that's why they

6991.76 --> 6995.280000000001
have it

6993.04 --> 6997.599
that's why they have that money because

6995.28 --> 7000.48
they never give it away unconditionally

6997.599 --> 7002.88
they never do that's the entire point

7000.48 --> 7004.5599999999995
like all their [ __ ] charities isn't

7002.88 --> 7007.36
even unconditional

7004.56 --> 7011.88
nothing they do is unconditional that's

7007.36 --> 7011.88
why they're rich don't you get it

7013.63 --> 7016.84
[Music]

7017.76 --> 7024.8
would i give most of my money away no

7021.84 --> 7024.8
absolutely not

7026.639 --> 7032.2390000000005
i would try to do

7029.04 --> 7034.32
like focused targeted good with it

7032.239 --> 7037.678999999999
but that would not until giving money

7034.32 --> 7040.0
away giving money away

7037.679 --> 7040.0
yeah

7040.32 --> 7045.84
i mean i might just like

7043.199 --> 7048.0
spray it around a little to make myself

7045.84 --> 7050.2390000000005
like kind of bitter popular right that

7048.0 --> 7053.28
might happen if i had huge amounts of

7050.239 --> 7056.638999999999
money i might do it but i am like

7053.28 --> 7059.5199999999995
i'm freaking dutch okay i don't just

7056.639 --> 7061.52
waste money like that i i mean i have in

7059.52 --> 7063.76
the past no i haven't in the past damn

7061.52 --> 7066.719
it stop saying that

7063.76 --> 7068.0
i have not done that i never did waste

7066.719 --> 7071.719
money

7068.0 --> 7071.719
i don't do that

7073.04 --> 7079.44
stop saying that i don't do that

7077.36 --> 7081.598999999999
i would always try to like even when i

7079.44 --> 7083.839999999999
had more money i would try to invest it

7081.599 --> 7086.2390000000005
in just good things that last the test

7083.84 --> 7087.52
of time that would be worthy i don't

7086.239 --> 7090.239
waste it

7087.52 --> 7092.56
i try not to misinvest and i will keep

7090.239 --> 7094.879999999999
doing that even if i become huge and

7092.56 --> 7097.599
have lots of money all of a sudden right

7094.88 --> 7101.119
but dude i can't even imagine that

7097.599 --> 7104.08
literally right at this point

7101.119 --> 7105.36
if i had like that and huge amount my

7104.08 --> 7107.679
life would be

7105.36 --> 7110.96
so turned around i would have to like

7107.679 --> 7112.08
rediscover who the [ __ ] i even am

7110.96 --> 7114.4
right

7112.08 --> 7115.5199999999995
i'm that freaking poor at this moment

7114.4 --> 7118.879999999999
all i'm

7115.52 --> 7121.599
really busying myself with is how can i

7118.88 --> 7124.0
prevent everything from crumbling around

7121.599 --> 7125.92
me pretty much that's my focus

7124.0 --> 7128.48
i can't even imagine what it's like to

7125.92 --> 7130.88
suddenly have a lot of money

7128.48 --> 7132.959999999999
like that permanently i can't imagine

7130.88 --> 7136.8
that

7132.96 --> 7138.2390000000005
i don't know exactly what would happen

7136.8 --> 7139.92
i mean i'm pretty sure i'd probably

7138.239 --> 7141.5199999999995
suddenly have like

7139.92 --> 7142.8
more girlfriends

7141.52 --> 7144.8
for sure

7142.8 --> 7147.4400000000005
at least temporarily

7144.8 --> 7150.2390000000005
it's just what lots of money suddenly

7147.44 --> 7152.48
falling on you does so

7150.239 --> 7154.159
it happened in the past

7152.48 --> 7155.199
but other than that

7154.159 --> 7157.28
i just

7155.199 --> 7158.719
tried to fix everything up and then see

7157.28 --> 7161.679
what's left

7158.719 --> 7161.679
see what i can do

7167.36 --> 7171.5199999999995
if arwen's channel went viral most of

7169.76 --> 7173.119000000001
our problems would disappear overnight

7171.52 --> 7174.56
what day

7173.119 --> 7178.48
huh

7174.56 --> 7178.4800000000005
well that's a lot of faith you put in me

7178.719 --> 7184.84
i appreciate that i don't know though

7181.679 --> 7184.84
you know

7192.08 --> 7197.5599999999995
i think i'd probably become more moody

7194.56 --> 7197.56
overall

7199.84 --> 7203.119000000001
because

7200.719 --> 7206.2390000000005
yeah in the past i had

7203.119 --> 7208.639
well inheritance from my mother

7206.239 --> 7210.959999999999
and that was barely anything

7208.639 --> 7210.96
really

7211.199 --> 7216.0
it was it was a bit but

7213.679 --> 7220.159
i'm not even gonna say it

7216.0 --> 7220.159
but i did not like what it did to me

7220.48 --> 7224.799999999999
knowing i had that money

7222.4 --> 7227.36
and suddenly like people would just

7224.8 --> 7228.8
start staring at me with greed they

7227.36 --> 7230.719
would there's like

7228.8 --> 7232.88
freaking money parasites out there that

7230.719 --> 7234.719
just know when you have money even if

7232.88 --> 7236.159000000001
you don't particularly look rich they

7234.719 --> 7238.84
just know it

7236.159 --> 7242.08
and that disgusts me i hate

7238.84 --> 7244.159000000001
that i hate like oh

7242.08 --> 7246.719
that's why i kind of like being that's

7244.159 --> 7249.598999999999
the part about being poor that i like is

7246.719 --> 7251.84
that nobody's whining to me

7249.599 --> 7254.96
for money nobody's trying to trick me

7251.84 --> 7258.4800000000005
into giving them money

7254.96 --> 7262.92
or invest in in whatever they're doing

7258.48 --> 7262.919999999999
right i hated that part

7270.0 --> 7273.36
right well garcia yeah

7274.159 --> 7279.36
but i mean if i'd suddenly like had

7276.719 --> 7282.4
millions and millions of followers

7279.36 --> 7284.719
then what i would say and i would say it

7282.4 --> 7287.5199999999995
i don't know man i might get myself into

7284.719 --> 7290.08
trouble for just my opinions

7287.52 --> 7292.56
for my view on for example how we need

7290.08 --> 7295.04
to deal with like the demonically

7292.56 --> 7295.04
possessed

7295.119 --> 7298.5599999999995
right i'd probably

7296.88 --> 7301.119
get more in trouble

7298.56 --> 7304.0
if i suddenly grew big like that i would

7301.119 --> 7306.32
like be almost forced to adapt the way i

7304.0 --> 7308.719
talk or literally police would come by

7306.32 --> 7311.199
every every show

7308.719 --> 7314.32
something like that i don't know man i

7311.199 --> 7316.96
it's again it's hard for me to imagine a

7314.32 --> 7318.719
reality like that so

7316.96 --> 7321.04
i don't think it's gonna happen anytime

7318.719 --> 7322.719
soon that would be crazy dude

7321.04 --> 7325.04
that would be crazy if that certainly

7322.719 --> 7326.719
happened i did i don't understand

7325.04 --> 7330.32
why it would happen

7326.719 --> 7332.88
i can't i can't see it happening

7330.32 --> 7332.88
i don't know

7347.199 --> 7350.159
i guess that if i suddenly had like a

7349.199 --> 7354.4
lot

7350.159 --> 7356.799999999999
i would probably end up just trying to

7354.4 --> 7358.239
prove my theories

7356.8 --> 7361.119000000001
right

7358.239 --> 7362.799999999999
so i would definitely go after trying to

7361.119 --> 7367.159
figure out

7362.8 --> 7367.159000000001
the orientation of the equator

7368.639 --> 7372.96
because then i'd certainly have all this

7371.119 --> 7376.4
money all this opportunity i could

7372.96 --> 7378.4
actually try to arrange that

7376.4 --> 7381.839999999999
would you go on alex jones for an

7378.4 --> 7381.839999999999
interview if you went viral

7383.76 --> 7386.159000000001
maybe

7386.8 --> 7390.0
although

7388.159 --> 7391.199
in my mind i'd always think that alex

7390.0 --> 7394.48
jones would be

7391.199 --> 7397.839999999999
like kind of pissed off at me

7394.48 --> 7399.199
i think he would try to flatter shamey

7397.84 --> 7402.719
i don't know

7399.199 --> 7402.719
maybe he wouldn't do that at all

7404.32 --> 7410.239
i can't say so please guys stop asking

7407.52 --> 7412.4800000000005
oh what would you do if you had my

7410.239 --> 7415.04
there's like endless amounts of things

7412.48 --> 7418.32
that i might or might not do

7415.04 --> 7419.679
i don't know i i can't imagine that

7418.32 --> 7422.48
really

7419.679 --> 7424.159
i don't know

7422.48 --> 7426.4
how it would

7424.159 --> 7429.119
how i would be different i can't predict

7426.4 --> 7431.5199999999995
that like i know things would

7429.119 --> 7433.759999999999
shift the energies of everything that

7431.52 --> 7436.400000000001
goes through me would shift i just don't

7433.76 --> 7438.2390000000005
know how i can only roughly

7436.4 --> 7440.4
cross-reference that

7438.239 --> 7442.5599999999995
to my past situation where i just had a

7440.4 --> 7444.638999999999
bit of inheritance money

7442.56 --> 7446.2390000000005
and how it changed me then

7444.639 --> 7448.400000000001
not for the better

7446.239 --> 7449.5199999999995
in my opinion

7448.4 --> 7451.92
right

7449.52 --> 7455.8
so i don't know i don't those are the

7451.92 --> 7455.8
things i don't know

7478.88 --> 7482.52
yeah virus

7495.599 --> 7499.32
oh shut up bakumo

7511.92 --> 7516.1990000000005
what are you guys bickering about

7539.599 --> 7546.8
don't ask him he's a [ __ ] he can't

7543.119 --> 7549.839999999999
understand those things as in like

7546.8 --> 7549.84
not capable

7550.0 --> 7556.079
you're not gonna get through to him yes

7552.32 --> 7558.48
it's super obvious yes it is absolute in

7556.079 --> 7561.199
irreversible proof

7558.48 --> 7564.239
that the earth is flat is not gonna he's

7561.199 --> 7566.5599999999995
not gonna learn it you get it he's not

7564.239 --> 7567.839999999999
going to learn it you can't force it in

7566.56 --> 7570.079000000001
his head

7567.84 --> 7571.92
he is going to remain ignorant because

7570.079 --> 7573.84
he chooses to

7571.92 --> 7576.8
you understand godzilla

7573.84 --> 7580.0
it's no use

7576.8 --> 7581.76
he's a [ __ ] because he chooses to be a

7580.0 --> 7585.079
[ __ ] and there's nothing you can do

7581.76 --> 7585.079000000001
about it

7592.159 --> 7598.159
hey seeking star wars

7595.28 --> 7600.239
i'm derp tonight at all

7598.159 --> 7603.96
yeah you understand sure

7600.239 --> 7603.959999999999
kumu yeah

7611.04 --> 7614.04
so

7625.119 --> 7629.36
i don't even know if it's fried at that

7627.28 --> 7631.36
point flatter stage i think it's just

7629.36 --> 7633.759999999999
lazy convenience

7631.36 --> 7635.04
just too lazy to allow it to sink in

7633.76 --> 7636.2390000000005
because then you have to change

7635.04 --> 7637.96
everything

7636.239 --> 7641.04
so they're just

7637.96 --> 7643.04
conveniently stupid it's just laziness

7641.04 --> 7645.599
it's not pride

7643.04 --> 7647.84
it's just laziness

7645.599 --> 7650.719
they're too lazy

7647.84 --> 7653.599
to evolve spiritually

7650.719 --> 7656.159
too lazy to move beyond

7653.599 --> 7658.079
the basic assertion

7656.159 --> 7659.598999999999
and then they spend a lot of time

7658.079 --> 7662.079
deflecting

7659.599 --> 7665.76
arguments from those that are not too

7662.079 --> 7665.759999999999
lazy to move beyond

7673.44 --> 7676.638999999999
