2.3 --> 7.379
good morning and welcome to flat earth

5.819 --> 13.65
earlybird number 60

7.379 --> 18.48
I'm your host Arwen and yeah welcome

13.65 --> 25.698999999999998
everyone today it's pretty much the same

18.48 --> 32.96
as yesterday except so being outside yet

25.699 --> 37.28
at a very late night and after that I

32.96 --> 37.28
couldn't really sleep all that well

37.61 --> 46.86
morning very annoying so yeah I pretty

42.149 --> 51.66
much woke up 25 minutes ago no wait

46.86 --> 53.129
35 and I'm still relatively on time so

51.66 --> 57.05
that's a comfort that's an

53.129 --> 57.05
accomplishment I think

64.9 --> 67.68
so

68.0 --> 82.44
I feel pretty much the same again

74.36 --> 90.53
yesterday then for trying to like let it

82.44 --> 94.77
sink everything just figure out this

90.53 --> 97.31
this freaky balance in this world what's

94.77 --> 97.31
going on

99.9 --> 106.82000000000001
is there a balance really is there a

102.6 --> 111.63
balance with humanity or is there only a

106.82 --> 115.41
seeming balance just enough to comfort

111.63 --> 119.16
us that everything is right but also

115.41 --> 121.64999999999999
just enough in balance to ensure that

119.16 --> 125.36
eventually everything will end up

121.65 --> 128.13
destroyed and that we will dream along

125.36 --> 132.95
every step of the way until there is

128.13 --> 132.95
nothing left but garbage and dust

138.61 --> 142.65
that's what is that what is happening

143.61 --> 151.59
that is this with all the drives and

148.9 --> 154.27
people and all this ins maniacal

151.59 --> 161.46
enthusiasm about specific things that

154.27 --> 165.96
are in the moment and the build-up of

161.46 --> 170.77
dissatisfaction when nothing new happens

165.96 --> 176.05
people will start waiting out of boredom

170.77 --> 180.34
for something to be destroyed out of

176.05 --> 185.459
freaking boredom is that all part of

180.34 --> 188.97
God's plan is that all part of our

185.459 --> 188.97
ingenious design

192.38 --> 198.46
now I'm not trying to last him anything

198.84 --> 213.02
but I I don't as much have my doubts

204.03 --> 213.02
about that as well as it just

215.97 --> 225.42
if you judge judge things only in the

219.84 --> 227.31
moment and you throw away the bad parts

225.42 --> 229.79999999999998
and you just forget about it and you

227.31 --> 233.79
just try to do better but you keep on

229.8 --> 236.43
doing these bad things in there as part

233.79 --> 240.51
of the world set up and you can't walk

236.43 --> 243.69
around it is that really good is that

240.51 --> 246.98999999999998
good is that actually helpful or is

243.69 --> 249.69
there no such thing as helpful and no

246.99 --> 253.41
matter what you do it's all a matter of

249.69 --> 255.6
okay how quickly do you want to

253.41 --> 260.79
absolutely destroy everything very

255.6 --> 265.43
quickly or just medium-paced is that it

260.79 --> 265.43
is that this works

266.2 --> 276.03999999999996
yeah and I'm not addressing any specific

269.14 --> 280.0
individual well yeah typical world's

276.04 --> 283.24
leaders for example any any of them will

280.0 --> 285.67
be right in the middle of this right

283.24 --> 288.28000000000003
dead center in the middle of this

285.67 --> 290.47
concept in the weighing scale right

288.28 --> 294.64
there where the decisions are made to

290.47 --> 298.93
absolutely destroy things irrevocably or

294.64 --> 303.34
to take that pressure and actually take

298.93 --> 306.88
the insanity from mankind subconsciously

303.34 --> 309.35999999999996
trying to force such a person to destroy

306.88 --> 309.36
everything

315.28 --> 318.28
yeah

321.0 --> 323.84
I'm just

328.65 --> 340.45
I'm sorry to say it makes no sense to me

333.1 --> 343.6
at all this entire thing why even if the

340.45 --> 346.39
purpose of it all for afterlife if there

343.6 --> 349.99
is such a thing even which I am getting

346.39 --> 351.78999999999996
my doubts even in that and trying to

349.99 --> 354.31
figure it out through all perspectives

351.79 --> 357.96000000000004
walking the path is good whether there

354.31 --> 363.13
be an afterlife or not it's necessary

357.96 --> 366.98999999999995
and energetic it is better so no matter

363.13 --> 366.99
where it leads but

372.25 --> 381.9
if this is all about experience then

376.93 --> 386.13
what is the need to experience all this

381.9 --> 390.34
senses the senseless inevitable

386.13 --> 394.81
destruction of everything what is the

390.34 --> 396.96999999999997
sense of experiencing this because in an

394.81 --> 399.7
overarching perspective from all

396.97 --> 402.85
perspectives from all insights it is

399.7 --> 407.59
nothing but evil and destruction it is

402.85 --> 410.85
like a kid just fooling around and

407.59 --> 414.88
wrecking everything until they're dead

410.85 --> 416.68
that is the whole setup here yeah you

414.88 --> 419.86
may learn some little little thing or

416.68 --> 427.09000000000003
two on the way but yeah everything is

419.86 --> 434.41
destroyed and it will die for with no

427.09 --> 437.65
recourse with no purpose why what is the

434.41 --> 441.97
sense of this or why are we forcefully

437.65 --> 445.53999999999996
driven in this direction why is this in

441.97 --> 450.16
our damn instinct why is this inner

445.54 --> 454.03000000000003
group instinct why do we have this

450.16 --> 457.81
impulse of ecstatic relief when

454.03 --> 463.08
something is destroyed when a group of

457.81 --> 463.08
people is killed and in our mind

463.18 --> 469.18
it's so terrible we feel so much

465.76 --> 477.37
compassion for them but in the energy in

469.18 --> 481.63
the air everything is relieved maybe not

477.37 --> 484.38
right away but if after that after yeah

481.63 --> 487.89
you got over your your personal

484.38 --> 490.24
affections and you move on after that Oh

487.89 --> 492.19
suddenly some breathing room this is

490.24 --> 493.99
really great actually why didn't we do

492.19 --> 500.53
this before oh yeah because it's

493.99 --> 503.62
terrible it's horrifying that's why it's

500.53 --> 505.84
really nice isn't it yeah I'm making

503.62 --> 508.77
everyone feel really happy about the

505.84 --> 508.77
world right now I think

516.88 --> 522.2
yes stopping traffic in my rest a hat

519.86 --> 525.02
yeah people ban you because you are so

522.2 --> 529.0400000000001
great at making friends you're so good

525.02 --> 534.13
at it you know everybody likes you

529.04 --> 534.13
because you always have like the most

534.43 --> 542.26
appreciative things to say about

536.36 --> 542.26
everyone you know

545.88 --> 551.89
that's what they like about you always

550.029 --> 559.269
have something positive to say to

551.89 --> 562.63
everyone about everything I'm gonna get

559.269 --> 565.649
some tea that's gonna be a tradition

562.63 --> 565.649
[Music]

616.23 --> 619.23
you

621.69 --> 629.19
yeah

623.26 --> 634.11
now you know what rhasta being right

629.19 --> 638.8900000000001
it's useless it is completely utterly

634.11 --> 641.73
useless because nobody needs anyone that

638.89 --> 645.3
is right especially in social order

641.73 --> 654.37
nobody needs anyone that's right

645.3 --> 661.3
you know so say that like like that's a

654.37 --> 663.24
good thing if you fail to see that in

661.3 --> 666.12
the process of bringing this

663.24 --> 669.85
righteousness this truth

666.12 --> 672.82
you're just a jeté ting people and that

669.85 --> 675.88
causes them no longer to listen at you

672.82 --> 679.33
and just see the agitation so yeah you

675.88 --> 683.41
can speak all the truth in the world and

679.33 --> 687.22
you can see things way a half a year

683.41 --> 690.64
before socially the evolved people could

687.22 --> 694.6
even get that far it's completely

690.64 --> 697.06
useless my friends because the way you

694.6 --> 703.03
express this the way you share this is

697.06 --> 707.13
with the nine agitation and nobody gives

703.03 --> 710.73
a [ __ ] that you see this coming okay

707.13 --> 710.73
nobody gives a [ __ ]

716.6 --> 721.63
just telling you as it is right now

723.66 --> 729.5699999999999
yeah and on the same note nobody gives a

726.72 --> 734.07
[ __ ] about what I see coming I say it on

729.57 --> 736.0500000000001
air I protect things nobody cares I can

734.07 --> 738.0
say it like half a year afterwards yeah

736.05 --> 741.42
it's exactly what I said and people say

738.0 --> 743.99
yeah oh yeah who could have seen nobody

741.42 --> 743.99
cares

755.13 --> 761.42
yeah here on the I am a little riled up

757.38 --> 764.97
today it was a little riled up yesterday

761.42 --> 770.5699999999999
and I feel like saying things how they

764.97 --> 775.53
are because I am sick of the lack of

770.57 --> 786.09
maneuvering capacity here very very sick

775.53 --> 789.06
of it and you know I'm almost freakin 40

786.09 --> 793.64
and I do feel like I'm in a prison right

789.06 --> 793.64
here and I want to get out of it

797.32 --> 802.59
and I'm

799.38 --> 805.68
yeah just say it I'm having serious

802.59 --> 810.33
serious doubt about having engaged in

805.68 --> 813.87
all this serious doubt not that I don't

810.33 --> 818.46
believe flat earth not that I don't like

813.87 --> 825.47
you guys it's just that this world works

818.46 --> 825.47
in a way that this disables you from

825.65 --> 835.89
from from engaging in anything else

832.13 --> 839.73
really unless you are sufficiently

835.89 --> 842.79
prepared and I am NOT I am in a building

839.73 --> 846.72
phase still in my life which is kind of

842.79 --> 847.98
sad since I am way too old to be in that

846.72 --> 855.08
position right now

847.98 --> 860.88
and this I don't know is this is this it

855.08 --> 867.45
you know been freaking on YouTube now

860.88 --> 869.54
for a daily basis now for over one and a

867.45 --> 871.97
half months

869.54 --> 876.05
and have been on YouTube for three years

871.97 --> 878.5400000000001
with over 200 hangouts and I still don't

876.05 --> 881.99
have a freaking thousand subscribers

878.54 --> 886.28
what the hell's going on I'm the only

881.99 --> 889.7
one here the only damn one that's been

886.28 --> 892.0699999999999
here online for three years and I don't

889.7 --> 895.7
even have a thousand subscribers what

892.07 --> 900.2600000000001
the freaking hell is going on here is

895.7 --> 902.57
this normal is this normal there people

900.26 --> 905.21
out there that are added for like two

902.57 --> 908.96
weeks that have thousands of subscribers

905.21 --> 914.0
what the hell is going on here this

908.96 --> 917.12
makes no sense to me and I'm sick of it

914.0 --> 919.7
I'm sick of this all is this just

917.12 --> 921.41
scratching just dip to work everyday for

919.7 --> 923.45
hours put everything in it sacrifice

921.41 --> 927.41
everything else which is a few

923.45 --> 931.6400000000001
subscribers or so could digitally beg

927.41 --> 936.23
for a couple of bucks is that it is this

931.64 --> 938.27
it for me this this my destiny is this

936.23 --> 939.53
really what I'm supposed to be doing is

938.27 --> 949.15
this good for me

939.53 --> 949.15
for anyone I'm sick of it I'm sick of it

955.379 --> 960.519
yeah I will compare myself to other

958.36 --> 964.48
people Nathan I will

960.519 --> 966.999
I'm added for three years three years

964.48 --> 972.2090000000001

966.999 --> 972.2090000000001
subscribers what the [ __ ] is going on

978.85 --> 984.279

981.819 --> 988.439
the real people that did subscribe but

984.279 --> 992.229
this is not normal this is not normal

988.439 --> 995.3499999999999
try to find anyone out there that's been

992.229 --> 998.35
at this this long they will have a

995.35 --> 1004.109
thousand subscribers probably tenfold

998.35 --> 1006.419
this makes no damn sense I feel like I'm

1004.109 --> 1013.139
being digitally strangled here on

1006.419 --> 1016.819
purpose why why is this happening this

1013.139 --> 1016.819
is not normal

1028.3 --> 1034.03

1062.9 --> 1068.3300000000002
parasite wasting my time or everybody

1066.23 --> 1070.88
builds up their intolerance and hatred

1068.33 --> 1072.1599999999999
of me while they've tried to maneuver me

1070.88 --> 1074.9
in a position where they could just

1072.16 --> 1077.3200000000002
execute me that's what a freaking feel

1074.9 --> 1077.3200000000002
here

1238.33 --> 1241.53

1239.46 --> 1244.539
financially speaking because

1241.53 --> 1247.03
intellectually speaking yeah of course

1244.539 --> 1248.86
things are what they are we if we have

1247.03 --> 1251.11
been developing I have been learning a

1248.86 --> 1254.1399999999999
huge amount of things more than I ever

1251.11 --> 1256.36
would have learned that I engaged in

1254.14 --> 1259.2700000000002
some university study all by myself

1256.36 --> 1262.99
without knowing when I was really

1259.27 --> 1267.19
approaching yeah but yeah in the

1262.99 --> 1268.48
meantime I've been a financial parasites

1267.19 --> 1271.51
to my country

1268.48 --> 1274.1200000000001
horray and I didn't make a freaking cent

1271.51 --> 1277.929
out of all of this they must be so happy

1403.21 --> 1406.57
you're a youtuber right you want to be a

1404.53 --> 1409.6
successful youtuber on YouTube and

1406.57 --> 1411.6399999999999
asleep in the chat and use no offense

1409.6 --> 1413.1699999999998
mate but I totally disagree with what

1411.64 --> 1415.0900000000001
you saying he's like people to be people

1413.17 --> 1417.4
try make money on flyer it's like I

1415.09 --> 1420.1899999999998
don't see it that way I'm a youtuber and

1417.4 --> 1422.1100000000001
YouTube gives me money if I'm a success

1420.19 --> 1423.6100000000001
on YouTube and that's all you're crying

1422.11 --> 1425.4099999999999
out for right you want to be a success

1423.61 --> 1427.3899999999999
for you to be quickly Alison you put the

1425.41 --> 1429.73
work in and you see other people come

1427.39 --> 1431.98
along they're not in the same arena so

1429.73 --> 1433.03
these people like fight the player than

1431.98 --> 1434.38
whoever else

1433.03 --> 1436.21
godless engineer who just suddenly

1434.38 --> 1437.8000000000002
become a success they're not in the same

1436.21 --> 1439.69
corner of games there's us they're in a

1437.8 --> 1441.07
very good reporter seems like they're in

1439.69 --> 1444.3200000000002
the same corner but they're not they're

1441.07 --> 1446.539
anti [ __ ] 12 months ago and

1444.32 --> 1448.61
but there was an absolutely

1446.539 --> 1450.769
insignificant portion of the internet

1448.61 --> 1453.3799999999999
suddenly it's blown up white player did

1450.769 --> 1455.419
five years ago so it's no different but

1453.38 --> 1457.73
we're oversaturated in this particular

1455.419 --> 1460.0700000000002
part of the internet there's far more

1457.73 --> 1462.529
youtubers making videos about Blatter

1460.07 --> 1464.0
than there is people potentially out

1462.529 --> 1466.34
there to subscribe to them so you're

1464.0 --> 1468.769
just limited in terms of how people can

1466.34 --> 1470.75
discover you the way to get around that

1468.769 --> 1472.3700000000001
is just do what you're doing now you're

1470.75 --> 1474.889
making videos daily

1472.37 --> 1476.2399999999998
and you kept to a timeslot you changed

1474.889 --> 1478.7589999999998
it by quarter now it doesn't matter to

1476.24 --> 1480.98
me to meticulous no no no no no no I

1478.759 --> 1483.08
that was just because I didn't think I

1480.98 --> 1485.72
was gonna be on time I didn't change the

1483.08 --> 1487.1589999999999
slot well fair enough but I'm just

1485.72 --> 1487.8790000000001
saying keeping it keeping a bit of

1487.159 --> 1489.6200000000001
regularity

1487.879 --> 1491.4189999999999
I mean Anthony's taught me this as I was

1489.62 --> 1493.1589999999999
doing sprats keeper never fancied it

1491.419 --> 1494.779
it's like but just keep it a regular

1493.159 --> 1497.3890000000001
time slot people get used to you doing

1494.779 --> 1499.309
that show and it will grow and you are

1497.389 --> 1501.9499999999998
growing very proud of what you've

1499.309 --> 1503.99
achieved so far you know I think you've

1501.95 --> 1506.419
done really well but if you can pace up

1503.99 --> 1507.769
to an people who will go bonkers because

1506.419 --> 1510.3200000000002
suddenly you can look at somebody else

1507.769 --> 1514.789
and go there do better is craps in the

1510.32 --> 1517.1589999999999
book it jail be Chad I don't know well

1514.789 --> 1517.789
it's not even dead like the dragon back

1517.159 --> 1519.98
to etiquette

1517.789 --> 1523.549
I'm not even trying to compare it I'm

1519.98 --> 1528.47
just looking at the data here three

1523.549 --> 1532.46
years okay three years off wide wide

1528.47 --> 1536.09
activity showing my face doing a lot of

1532.46 --> 1538.7
videos building up a lore I have a

1536.09 --> 1542.2099999999998
freaking war of my own that I've been

1538.7 --> 1544.6390000000001
constructing three years why not why

1542.21 --> 1548.0900000000001
don't I have a thousand subscribers it

1544.639 --> 1551.0
makes no sense maybe you can take a few

1548.09 --> 1552.6789999999999
three years now you will carry the

1551.0 --> 1554.529
substitute to having a thousand

1552.679 --> 1557.48
subscribers won't make you feel better

1554.529 --> 1562.279
it will it will because I will actually

1557.48 --> 1564.1390000000001
be able to start getting the super chat

1562.279 --> 1566.539
whatever I made I don't know maybe

1564.139 --> 1567.74
they'll set me in a waiting role for two

1566.539 --> 1569.99
years I don't know

1567.74 --> 1573.379
at least I could

1569.99 --> 1575.72
say yeah finally I cut to the beginning

1573.379 --> 1577.6999999999998
stage okay

1575.72 --> 1578.779
the state's ready can actually start to

1577.7 --> 1581.45
thank you seriously

1578.779 --> 1583.669
finally I get it totally but by the same

1581.45 --> 1585.3500000000001
token yeah you might get to a thousand

1583.669 --> 1587.269
subscribers get you four thousand hours

1585.35 --> 1589.4289999999999
of watch time get all of your adsense

1587.269 --> 1591.769
sorted and they don't approve you three

1589.429 --> 1594.3200000000002
months or four months warranty well if

1591.769 --> 1596.179
at that point you like fuming mad it's

1594.32 --> 1597.71
like you're doing the wrong thing you

1596.179 --> 1599.539
don't make the videos because you like

1597.71 --> 1602.269
making video or you like submit

1599.539 --> 1604.309
specifically either way do what you do

1602.269 --> 1607.009
because you love it at the moment you're

1604.309 --> 1610.369
sounding like despise it and that is

1607.009 --> 1614.1490000000001
concerning because then you know do some

1610.369 --> 1616.61
accounts do something you love yeah yeah

1614.149 --> 1617.889
well there's a big problem I can't find

1621.139 --> 1631.399
an actual sounds weird a girl right now

1628.7 --> 1635.059

to me it's and I explained this it's not

1635.059 --> 1640.759
it's not YouTube it's not doing this

1637.669 --> 1643.159

1646.429 --> 1651.799
life about stuff that's fine I have so

continuing yeah it's just I always I'm

1922.84 --> 1926.26
just saying it's better keep a servant

1924.28 --> 1927.52
they don't drive something that's

1926.26 --> 1929.23
comparing yourself to people you've

1927.52 --> 1931.36
certainly had the easy because you don't

1929.23 --> 1933.07
know what their road is and it doesn't

1931.36 --> 1934.51
matter you know if they happen to jump

1933.07 --> 1937.3899999999999
on a bandwagon this couple success

1934.51 --> 1939.61
instantly good for them kudos give him

1937.39 --> 1942.0600000000002
encouragement also as a youtuber you

1939.61 --> 1944.5
know then one of the few things that

1942.06 --> 1946.48
team skeptic was saying that I agreed

1944.5 --> 1948.73
with was and even to Mossman today said

1946.48 --> 1950.41
the same thing it's like look he was

1948.73 --> 1951.82
very complimentary two minutes like look

1950.41 --> 1955.27
on watch this bag build-up that channel

1951.82 --> 1956.62
the ground up and to watch you just get

1955.27 --> 1957.8799999999999
taken away for no reason is totally

1956.62 --> 1960.1
unreasonable even if I don't agree with

1957.88 --> 1961.66
what he say and I think yeah of their

1960.1 --> 1962.74
team skeptics say something similar and

1961.66 --> 1965.2900000000002
it seems to be pasted that this

1962.74 --> 1967.0
consensus among huge Eva's what crap me

1965.29 --> 1970.3899999999999
approach to [ __ ] this morning actually

1967.0 --> 1971.59
are we know who's basically saying we're

1970.39 --> 1973.15
all looking for attention

1971.59 --> 1974.6499999999999
just attention [ __ ] there's kind of

1973.15 --> 1976.45
the spin who's putting on it but it's a

1974.65 --> 1978.22
complete hundred eighty degree turn from

1976.45 --> 1979.3300000000002
about couple years ago it's like you

1978.22 --> 1981.3700000000001
guys aren't getting enough attention

1979.33 --> 1983.5
nobody's paying attention you're not

1981.37 --> 1986.26
going makes three no that's right yeah

1983.5 --> 1988.24
you used to say that didn't he yeah I

1986.26 --> 1991.54
don't say that anymore now do they

1988.24 --> 1993.22
what's the same people used to say and

1991.54 --> 1997.0
these people are trying to make money

1993.22 --> 1999.75
off platter but now it's they're not

1997.0 --> 2006.5
making enough money you've got a flat

1999.75 --> 2006.5
enough to fix just Christ yeah

2006.86 --> 2014.4599999999998
yeah and and a in a few years maybe if

2011.28 --> 2016.8899999999999
we're lucky they will be saying yes see

2014.46 --> 2018.42
there's still a lot of Global's left we

2016.89 --> 2023.2800000000002
will never go away yeah you have to

2018.42 --> 2026.1000000000001
majority but we will always be here in

2023.28 --> 2028.05
20 years as hey yes Stephen there's

2026.1 --> 2030.24
still some glow words around we still

2028.05 --> 2031.8

2058.13 --> 2064.8
in any progression towards the whole

2061.8 --> 2067.2000000000003
situation where you could perhaps start

2064.8 --> 2069.1490000000003
like a new sock and do another live

2067.2 --> 2074.5499999999997

yeah it's gonna be fun you know that's

2201.18 --> 2209.91
it yeah I'm looking here at my very

2206.94 --> 2213.32
first hangout where I appear life it was

2209.91 --> 2218.0699999999997
October 1st 2016

2213.32 --> 2221.19
so yeah that's when I started

2218.07 --> 2223.53
it's over first 2016 so I'm just little

2221.19 --> 2226.32
over two years active but it was like

2223.53 --> 2231.8100000000004
not making videos but still very active

2226.32 --> 2234.3900000000003
since 2015 do I didn't even know YouTube

2231.81 --> 2237.18
live was a thing until fluttered I

2234.39 --> 2241.5299999999997
didn't know people can chat in Iraq like

2237.18 --> 2243.4199999999996
live in YouTube big time I had no idea I

2241.53 --> 2247.4700000000003
mean this is all new to me

2243.42 --> 2249.54
well I saw it then I just saw it

2247.47 --> 2251.0099999999998
happening and when are you first see

2249.54 --> 2252.87
people doing that especially when

2251.01 --> 2255.9900000000002
they're not used to it's like oh this

2252.87 --> 2260.39
looks awkward you know that's my first

2255.99 --> 2263.43
impression of the entire system and then

2260.39 --> 2267.12
yeah things started rolling and the flat

2263.43 --> 2270.02
earth kind of hype the fire started to

2267.12 --> 2273.44
awaken with Marcus Arjun and all these

2270.02 --> 2276.48
this whole group and then yeah there's

2273.44 --> 2279.2400000000002
the enthusiastic rage for flat earth

2276.48 --> 2282.06
started up and then yeah I knew like

2279.24 --> 2284.7599999999998
okay this is the format it might have

2282.06 --> 2288.57
been awkward for just people just doing

2284.76 --> 2291.2400000000002
stuff like oh hi I'm on video this is so

2288.57 --> 2293.46
special from that stage that started

2291.24 --> 2296.7299999999996
pretty much in the 90s to actually

2293.46 --> 2300.48
having a real interactive media platform

2296.73 --> 2304.17
where where you can apply a purpose and

2300.48 --> 2308.85
a goal and form groups and that's what

2304.17 --> 2313.85
we've been doing and yeah we raised the

2308.85 --> 2313.85
bar for interactive media in that sense

2315.17 --> 2320.65
we made it in yeah it's funny you know

2324.849 --> 2330.38
yeah and I appreciate I was checking

2327.41 --> 2332.18

2520.22 --> 2526.0699999999997
that's like an extension of my agitated

2522.56 --> 2528.86
state here it's like weird because when

2526.07 --> 2532.4900000000002
I like this weird [ __ ] starts to happen

2528.86 --> 2535.9700000000003
not like magical [ __ ] like just typical

2532.49 --> 2537.29
like yesterday before like a half an

2535.97 --> 2539.93
hour before I went to bed I was

2537.29 --> 2543.32
basically smoking the last Joey sitting

2539.93 --> 2545.96
outside there's like yeah it's nice nice

2543.32 --> 2548.54
and suddenly like this bird I don't even

2545.96 --> 2551.18
know what kind of bird it was like a

2548.54 --> 2553.37
pretty big one a totally unexpected in

2551.18 --> 2556.2799999999997
the middle of the Black Knight flew like

2553.37 --> 2567.2
two meters past me in the pitch black as

2556.28 --> 2571.5400000000004
I like that yeah and like two meters

2567.2 --> 2571.54
past me completely unexpected just like

2575.71 --> 2582.08
an owl no owls don't make that sound

2579.79 --> 2584.06
they do hear there's something called a

2582.08 --> 2586.58
screeching owl it was like a somebody's

2584.06 --> 2590.5299999999997
screaming I think it was like a stalk or

2586.58 --> 2590.5299999999997
how do you what's the name

2595.79 --> 2600.95
yeah a stork I think it was a stork that

2598.94 --> 2602.93
was just having a nightmare or something

2600.95 --> 2605.96
and started screaming and flying around

2602.93 --> 2609.9199999999996
all of a sudden because it was that big

2605.96 --> 2613.4900000000002
and I think it made what sounds do

2609.92 --> 2615.29
storks make I don't know it sounded no

2613.49 --> 2618.97
idea I've never heard a stork make a

2615.29 --> 2622.82
sound well there you go

2618.97 --> 2632.2999999999997
hmm stork bird sound let's see if I can

2622.82 --> 2636.11
find something stork making sounds okay

2632.3 --> 2640.9100000000003
well that's not the sound okay maybe

2636.11 --> 2642.8900000000003
it's another time okay it's more like a

2640.91 --> 2644.81
drum maybe it's not a story it's like an

2642.89 --> 2653.87
but it's you should have taken it out

2644.81 --> 2656.2999999999997
with your arrow I'm kidding and come on

2653.87 --> 2659.27
I want you out there Kevin bird do you

2656.3 --> 2663.38

2659.27 --> 2664.91

2663.38 --> 2667.4
target practice you don't not to like

2664.91 --> 2669.79
necessarily kill things but where to

2667.4 --> 2669.79

2670.79 --> 2675.92
by wearing what I always ask you about

2678.65 --> 2683.51
compound bow that I use I shoot it in my

backyard oh it might have been a here on

2686.75 --> 2694.52

gonna make a sound wow that actually

2741.65 --> 2753.56
comes really close yeah it sounded

2746.51 --> 2760.01
completely insane yeah yeah it was okay

2753.56 --> 2762.56
I guess I guess it wasn't here on that's

2760.01 --> 2772.3
described like the sound that I made

2762.56 --> 2777.5
right freaky [ __ ] did you guys hear that

2772.3 --> 2780.5
kinda let me try again

2777.5 --> 2782.33
at least I didn't kill you mmm that's

2780.5 --> 2789.86
the moral of the story that didn't kill

2782.33 --> 2793.79
you true true yeah but yeah it flew like

2789.86 --> 2796.19
by all of a sudden making very loud

2793.79 --> 2798.77
noises in the middle of night right next

2796.19 --> 2810.1
to me when I was totally not expecting

2798.77 --> 2812.81
it okay nice nature just quietly sorry I

2810.1 --> 2814.7
said most birds are quiet at night I

2812.81 --> 2815.66
don't hear very many bird sounds at

2814.7 --> 2822.89
night and I live in the middle of the

2815.66 --> 2824.3599999999997
woods that's weird but yeah it was out

2822.89 --> 2827.06
of place it was in the middle of the

2824.36 --> 2829.1200000000003
night like half past four at night there

2827.06 --> 2831.74
was nothing you couldn't even hear

2829.12 --> 2834.14
engines or anything or cars and then

2831.74 --> 2836.72
suddenly this creature just flies by I

2834.14 --> 2838.67
didn't hear him approach and but right

2836.72 --> 2844.49
when he was next to me he was yelling

2838.67 --> 2848.63
full full power wasn't a bat yeah I

2844.49 --> 2850.85
don't think bats make that sound all the

2848.63 --> 2854.03
bats should be either they should be

2850.85 --> 2857.8289999999997
going south now seems to be in the warm

2854.03 --> 2860.1800000000003
areas god that's around you

2857.829 --> 2862.549
there are bats around here all the time

2860.18 --> 2865.8799999999997
I see him a lot but they never make

2862.549 --> 2869.42
sound and they don't fly around during

2865.88 --> 2872.589
that time of day he was in there trying

2869.42 --> 2872.589
to figure out hidden behind

2877.569 --> 2886.609
I wouldn't recommend it to him because I

2884.69 --> 2893.779
probably accidentally throw him off the

2886.609 --> 2895.069
balcony if you did that out of reflex so

2893.779 --> 2898.489
I was just standing there in the middle

2895.069 --> 2900.769
of the night like a somebody was

2898.489 --> 2902.209
standing there on the balcony next to me

2900.769 --> 2908.479
trying to start a movie yeah I'll

2902.209 --> 2913.91
probably do something drastic that

2908.479 --> 2915.3799999999997
happens accidentally chirality in chat

2913.91 --> 2917.5389999999998
he said he's gonna get you to a thousand

2915.38 --> 2925.539
subscribers by tomorrow they see all

2917.539 --> 2925.539
right nobody retracted okay

2927.21 --> 2938.55
I don't know lotty seems that how do you

2934.619 --> 2942.3900000000003
say I don't know that he was in a troll

2938.55 --> 2946.17
but it seems like he's been domesticated

2942.39 --> 2960.02
maybe is that the right word yeah he

2946.17 --> 2962.4900000000002
used to be pretty funny master yeah I

2960.02 --> 2966.2599999999998
remember his activity on the Flat Earth

2962.49 --> 2974.04
debates and in the early shows Nathan

2966.26 --> 2978.75
premiered one the other day he's trying

2974.04 --> 2980.7
to moderate yeah he's trying to welcome

2978.75 --> 2983.42
guests you telling me to calm down let

2980.7 --> 2983.4199999999996
me welcome the gas

2994.16 --> 3005.7889999999998
whoo car show is offering to share his

2999.23 --> 3005.789
paper on the shape of the earth Oh God

3006.119 --> 3013.9
what's who is it that just great have

3011.589 --> 3017.259
you seen it our win no I'm gonna look at

3013.9 --> 3025.2690000000002
it right now yeah look at it it's pretty

3017.259 --> 3028.72
funny all we need oh wait

3025.269 --> 3032.529
hmm oh yeah I see a lot of Statistics I

3028.72 --> 3035.68
think this is pretty good summary of all

3032.529 --> 3041.71
the global machinations put into one

3035.68 --> 3048.509
document claim distinctions tests

3041.71 --> 3049.809
results right who taught you that was

3048.509 --> 3053.259
kosher

3049.809 --> 3056.8900000000003
yep the the newest most persistent pain

3053.259 --> 3060.64
in the ass stroll around is he really a

3056.89 --> 3065.589
troll or is he just a yes 100 plate

3060.64 --> 3068.74
meshes Glover no he's a troll how do you

3065.589 --> 3071.38
know because okay you know I run that

3068.74 --> 3074.74
that discord server the 24/7 Flat Earth

3071.38 --> 3078.7000000000003
discord server well he started coming on

3074.74 --> 3081.279
our server and my moderators ended up

3078.7 --> 3083.589
banning him and then he started using a

3081.279 --> 3085.329
VPN and he comes back like literally

3083.589 --> 3087.88
he'll come back with like 20 different

3085.329 --> 3092.079
accounts in one day like he keeps coming

3087.88 --> 3096.5190000000002
back yeah and your hangout or somebody's

3092.079 --> 3099.1600000000003
hangout as like as Jay Phoenix or

3096.519 --> 3103.1189999999997
something like that era that's what it

3099.16 --> 3104.769
was fair oh yeah and I was saying we

3103.119 --> 3108.809
have this game on the server it's called

3104.769 --> 3108.8089999999997
finding Co show instead of finding Waldo

3109.349 --> 3117.67
yes yes but I still don't I'm not sure

3115.39 --> 3118.23
like how does that prove he is a troll

3117.67 --> 3121.6800000000003
if

3118.23 --> 3124.56
is now writing a paper and I've looked

3121.68 --> 3127.1699999999996
at it it is pretty pretty big so it does

3124.56 --> 3131.58
seem to have put a lot of work into that

3127.17 --> 3134.609
whatever the quality may be so are you

3131.58 --> 3137.85
sure he's not just a an enthusiast that

3134.609 --> 3141.09
just is acting over here it's like

3137.85 --> 3142.65
psychotic he's it's it's not normal

3141.09 --> 3144.7200000000003
behavior it's not like a normal troll

3142.65 --> 3153.96
it's not like a normal global behavior

3144.72 --> 3155.22
at all define our globe believers right

3153.96 --> 3158.04
and they'll come and talk to you but

3155.22 --> 3161.3999999999996
they behave normally like they're not

3158.04 --> 3163.2599999999998
they're not creating you know 50 stock

3161.4 --> 3172.6800000000003
accounts in one day just to keep coming

3163.26 --> 3181.4100000000003
back to keep harassing people a lot of

3172.68 --> 3184.08
people do do that okay but he's

3181.41 --> 3188.3689999999997
definitely one of the more tenacious

3184.08 --> 3191.79
ones I guess yeah he has been very

3188.369 --> 3193.56
tenacious with me like yeah come on take

3191.79 --> 3216.21
a look at it come on I want to be in the

3193.56 --> 3220.38
show that right in the flower yes he

3216.21 --> 3224.04
probably died from lack of tension in

3220.38 --> 3225.57
his heart that propelled him to continue

3224.04 --> 3230.22
and now that the Flat Earth debate is

3225.57 --> 3234.9900000000002
over he just died it's like he lost his

3230.22 --> 3237.0299999999997
will to keep fighting all right because

3234.99 --> 3239.1299999999997
there wasn't anything like math like he

3237.03 --> 3241.1400000000003
was just like although his parents he's

3239.13 --> 3243.7400000000002
like Angie Lee we've got nobody to fight

3241.14 --> 3251.5499999999997
he doesn't have a book with a fight so

3243.74 --> 3258.2999999999997
Nathan Nathan is his Goku cryogenically

3251.55 --> 3270.96
himself debate and is the bail

3258.3 --> 3272.52
notification goes then the big names of

3270.96 --> 3275.52
fluttered debunkers like fight the

3272.52 --> 3277.05
flowers he I mean he was a gamer before

3275.52 --> 3279.15
he used to do Bonnie but he found this

3277.05 --> 3281.61
little corner now you seen the video on

3279.15 --> 3284.28
him being a gamer I'm being [ __ ] do

3281.61 --> 3287.85
finish it and then he's in the flutter

3284.28 --> 3291.3300000000004
really like he is this expert in all day

3287.85 --> 3292.65
in all the subjects about the earth no

3291.33 --> 3296.97
yeah this morning

3292.65 --> 3299.1
Bonnie that's it it was yeah that guy's

3296.97 --> 3307.97
kind of nobody is going to be expert

3299.1 --> 3310.23
just what you proof do you have that I

3307.97 --> 3315.8399999999997
don't care what kind of games you're

3310.23 --> 3319.17
playing his champion are there to watch

3315.84 --> 3322.1400000000003
the facts they're mostly there to be

3319.17 --> 3324.66
tempered and comforted that yeah don't

3322.14 --> 3327.2999999999997
worry about those flat earthers the

3324.66 --> 3329.64
balls gonna live forever I think that's

3327.3 --> 3334.26
mostly the type of people that is are

3329.64 --> 3336.27
coming there because if you want to find

3334.26 --> 3338.1000000000004
a letter then you got to figure out the

3336.27 --> 3341.88
flat earth and that's not the type of

3338.1 --> 3343.86
channel to do that like do you think

3341.88 --> 3346.8900000000003
it's just that they're getting mad now

3343.86 --> 3349.4100000000003
like because this nonsense was supposed

3346.89 --> 3352.49
to go away years ago right like this was

3349.41 --> 3354.66
just supposed to be some fad and

3352.49 --> 3358.6699999999996
nobody's gonna be talking about it

3354.66 --> 3358.67
that's what they like years ago right

3359.93 --> 3364.49
like that's the route it's going

3366.54 --> 3376.08
guys keep holding on to soundly in his

3370.38 --> 3381.2400000000002
bridge and that changed to be really all

3376.08 --> 3387.12
you got we all know that's not really

3381.24 --> 3389.43
culture but you know they I get the

3387.12 --> 3393.9
feeling that they've even abandoned

3389.43 --> 3397.83
really trying to look for more curvature

3393.9 --> 3400.44
suggesting anomalies and I think that

3397.83 --> 3404.13
there many of them are now just doing

3400.44 --> 3407.1
what Timmy does and it is just say look

3404.13 --> 3408.9900000000002
all these flat earthers things they got

3407.1 --> 3412.2599999999998
proof of Flat Earth well it all proves

3408.99 --> 3414.12
the ball they all proves the ball that's

3412.26 --> 3415.92
I think that is their new approach so

3414.12 --> 3418.62
they actually don't have to do anything

3415.92 --> 3421.02
anymore they dead let us do the work and

3418.62 --> 3424.5299999999997
then they [ __ ] all over at sea I'll see

3421.02 --> 3426.78
if you take a diarrhea dump on all of

3424.53 --> 3430.11
his work then you can mold it all into a

3426.78 --> 3432.7400000000002
nice ball that's their new strategy and

3430.11 --> 3435.96
then shut down channels that can bring

3432.74 --> 3437.58
that can bring a fight to this battle

3435.96 --> 3438.9
you know like Nathan Oakley they're

3437.58 --> 3440.79
worried about him because he's making a

3438.9 --> 3443.73
big difference it's shutting down all

3440.79 --> 3446.34
these clowns and they say no we got to

3443.73 --> 3450.81
shut him up because it's creating too

3446.34 --> 3456.03
much stir you know well Nathan does

3450.81 --> 3458.13
definitely hit people like you can

3456.03 --> 3463.71
criticize people you can get angry

3458.13 --> 3467.19
towards people you can break down their

3463.71 --> 3471.96
indecencies and their machinations but

3467.19 --> 3474.6
Nathan like really really really really

3471.96 --> 3478.71
crushes them like nobody else that I see

3474.6 --> 3482.5099999999998
and he does it graciously and I think

3478.71 --> 3486.78
that is just another layer to it all and

3482.51 --> 3489.84
I think that is what causes like pretty

3486.78 --> 3491.6600000000003
heavy allergic reactions in a lot of

3489.84 --> 3496.199
ballers

3491.66 --> 3498.719
so I think that's probably why somebody

3496.199 --> 3502.289
did what they did and started to attack

3498.719 --> 3506.7290000000003
his channels in the fashion that it that

3502.289 --> 3512.869
it has been attacked so yeah Nathan does

3506.729 --> 3512.8689999999997
definitely Nathan hurts feelings

3513.289 --> 3522.9300000000003
feelings he raises and lowers the bar at

3517.89 --> 3530.969
the same time yeah it's quite the truth

3522.93 --> 3533.1299999999997
I understand exactly oh you mean it's

3530.969 --> 3534.329
both hurt because right if they if they

3533.13 --> 3536.489
don't want to listen to him him they

3534.329 --> 3538.8900000000003
don't want interaction don't go to his

3536.489 --> 3540.479
channel don't go in his panel you know

3538.89 --> 3542.0989999999997
don't just in it right

3540.479 --> 3544.529
that's all you got to do you don't have

3542.099 --> 3546.059
to go and go and then try to shut them

3544.529 --> 3548.279
down but they can't I don't know

3546.059 --> 3551.759
something I don't go you know they can't

3548.279 --> 3553.89
get away Jose don't you know they are 24

3551.759 --> 3555.779
hours a day in that chat you can see

3553.89 --> 3560.0389999999998
them chatting 24 hours a day they can't

3555.779 --> 3562.019
get away literally think they you're

3560.039 --> 3564.329
suggesting like why don't you just not

3562.019 --> 3567.6899999999996
watch so but then you're suggesting that

3564.329 --> 3570.119
they can actually have options to do

3567.69 --> 3573.569
other things no they are they're always

3570.119 --> 3580.589
that's like the only place they live in

3573.569 --> 3583.249
Nathan's chat mgc goes on for hours and

3580.589 --> 3586.049
hours afterwards

3583.249 --> 3588.769
sometimes they continue chatting even up

3586.049 --> 3591.199
until the next day it just continues

3588.769 --> 3597.5989999999997
they can't do anything else

3591.199 --> 3599.849
it's just they are cursed or bound to

3597.599 --> 3601.799
stalk the Flat Earth debates they cannot

3599.849 --> 3603.719
do any place it's like they hate the

3601.799 --> 3606.15
subject so much but yet they're

3603.719 --> 3608.819
compelled to be here there's an apple to

3606.15 --> 3610.65
be involved in it something

3608.819 --> 3616.47
subconsciously is telling

3610.65 --> 3618.53
they have to be here maybe somehow maybe

3616.47 --> 3622.5
subconsciously some of them believe it

3618.53 --> 3626.4300000000003
and are just waiting for the time to be

3622.5 --> 3627.0
able to understand it a quick change of

3626.43 --> 3629.3999999999996
subject

3627.0 --> 3631.47
a ferrenby I see you you were in the in

3629.4 --> 3634.14
the shot yesterday moderating on the on

3631.47 --> 3637.16
the Monday night was a Monday Night Raw

3634.14 --> 3640.77
no the show on journalism and the ITRs

3637.16 --> 3643.5
with that guy of the we go to the moon

3640.77 --> 3646.44
what do you what's your take on that a

3643.5 --> 3648.57
quick take of me he he didn't want to

3646.44 --> 3650.67
give his own opinion you feel like he

3648.57 --> 3654.3
was afraid somehow I don't know if he

3650.67 --> 3656.7000000000003
was being control or just just he was

3654.3 --> 3657.36
talked to like you cannot talk beyond

3656.7 --> 3660.0
this point

3657.36 --> 3661.2000000000003
you got these certain subjects to talk

3660.0 --> 3663.54
about and you don't give your own

3661.2 --> 3667.98
opinion that was my take he was afraid

3663.54 --> 3671.7599999999998
he was he wasn't gonna get off his you

3667.98 --> 3672.9900000000002
know kind of subject yeah yeah I would

3671.76 --> 3675.15
agree with that I mean you're talking

3672.99 --> 3677.7299999999996
about a guy who he's been on like

3675.15 --> 3679.2000000000003
mainstream news channels and stuff you

3677.73 --> 3681.9900000000002
know doing interviews and he makes

3679.2 --> 3683.8799999999997
documentaries so it's like someone like

3681.99 --> 3686.9399999999996
that I don't think is gonna go you know

3683.88 --> 3688.71
full red pill publicly because they want

3686.94 --> 3691.9500000000003
to still be accepted into these circles

3688.71 --> 3703.38
and you know talk on these [ __ ]

3691.95 --> 3705.21
shows you know I don't know your

3703.38 --> 3707.31
personal opinion just give me this one

3705.21 --> 3709.71
personal opinion about what do you think

3707.31 --> 3710.94
did we go or no he go like yeah I really

3709.71 --> 3713.2200000000003
don't wanna you know in my opinion

3710.94 --> 3715.53
everything is in the documentary and

3713.22 --> 3718.02
I've been explaining it at all come on

3715.53 --> 3720.09
you can speak on yeah yeah I agree with

3718.02 --> 3722.67
jarran though like how is it that you're

3720.09 --> 3724.86
so responsible I mean the the name of

3722.67 --> 3727.89
the movies there we go like you're

3724.86 --> 3730.86
you're making a documentary about if we

3727.89 --> 3732.87
went to the moon or not and by the end

3730.86 --> 3734.4900000000002
of the movie you've been given this

3732.87 --> 3737.49
money to make this movie in and at the

3734.49 --> 3739.5
end of it you still haven't even had a

3737.49 --> 3739.77
clear assessment of whether we did or

3739.5 --> 3742.26
not

3739.77 --> 3743.47
even I mean you can't even say that for

3742.26 --> 3745.63
sure we went

3743.47 --> 3749.8489999999997
I mean it's just weird to me it seems

3745.63 --> 3754.27
like a waste of money you know I don't

3749.849 --> 3757.15
basically missing therapy it's the new

3754.27 --> 3760.569
subject think about it don'ts don't draw

3757.15 --> 3762.76
conclusion just think about it be amused

3760.569 --> 3764.829
Jerry said he watched it and he said

3762.76 --> 3771.67
what he got from it is that we didn't go

3764.829 --> 3773.65
to the moon so it's very possibly these

3771.67 --> 3775.39
guy got the same thing but he just does

3773.65 --> 3777.369
it doesn't want to say it maybe you know

3775.39 --> 3779.5
he's just not gonna say it outright

3777.369 --> 3781.329
because then he could be he could be

3779.5 --> 3783.22
burning bridges with connections with

3781.329 --> 3785.079
certain people that he has who knows you

3783.22 --> 3785.6189999999997
never know your whole life is gonna

3785.079 --> 3788.53
change

3785.619 --> 3790.329
well how does it figure like that like

3788.53 --> 3792.94
this is this lake this is why I was I

3790.329 --> 3795.25
kind of respected this Owen Benjamin guy

3792.94 --> 3797.589
because I've never heard of him before

3795.25 --> 3800.5
like a week ago I'd never heard of him

3797.589 --> 3803.2599999999998
and everybody's telling me about it all

3800.5 --> 3805.75
go listen some gold some song and it's

3803.26 --> 3809.1090000000004
hilarious first of all the dudes

3805.75 --> 3812.23
hilarious like geez what do you know but

3809.109 --> 3814.48
like it's it's funny to see him kind of

3812.23 --> 3818.41
just waking up to this [ __ ] in real

3814.48 --> 3822.609
time and how he's calling out like the

3818.41 --> 3825.5499999999997
moon landings and I mean it's honestly

3822.609 --> 3827.589
it's awesome to hear because he says a

3825.55 --> 3831.4
lot of the same [ __ ] that a lot of us

3827.589 --> 3833.74
say and the fact that even though he's

3831.4 --> 3835.6600000000003
still kind of of police living a gold

3833.74 --> 3839.2
even though he still has questions about

3835.66 --> 3842.23
it it it's nice to hear somebody even

3839.2 --> 3846.16
who still believes that but can question

3842.23 --> 3851.109
it because the evidence the question is

3846.16 --> 3853.77
out there you know yeah so I think it's

3851.109 --> 3856.0
kind of awesome that he's on that route

3853.77 --> 3857.65
well I mean we already know he's been

3856.0 --> 3859.27
watching Flat Earth channels and Flat

3857.65 --> 3862.569
Earth videos because he's talked about

3859.27 --> 3865.47
him on his streams a few times he's

3862.569 --> 3868.3
talked about Oh Dee Dee videos he's

3865.47 --> 3872.1699999999996
and a few other people and supposedly

3868.3 --> 3877.57
he's supposed to have Eric Dubay on say

3872.17 --> 3879.94
that that's what it's like you can

3877.57 --> 3883.3
easily in a week I've heard I've heard

3879.94 --> 3885.4
him like gives better arguments for why

3883.3 --> 3888.03
we didn't land on the moon did some of

3885.4 --> 3892.3
these Rovers that we've spoken to for

3888.03 --> 3898.1800000000003
how long on YouTube I don't underst you

3892.3 --> 3901.3
know it's so it's so simple to see how

3898.18 --> 3902.89
full of [ __ ] it is that I don't

3901.3 --> 3904.96
understand I know it's cognitive

3902.89 --> 3906.8199999999997
dissonance or something but I don't

3904.96 --> 3909.67
understand how people don't see it

3906.82 --> 3911.59
through it and then they call us crazy

3909.67 --> 3913.87
because we're trying to bring it out to

3911.59 --> 3915.2400000000002
people it's like guys we're we're just

3913.87 --> 3917.8599999999997
trying to tell you

3915.24 --> 3920.2599999999998
look what [ __ ] that they're trying

3917.86 --> 3923.05
to pull over your eyes so we're doing

3920.26 --> 3925.2400000000002
this guy is his career you know he has

3923.05 --> 3926.77
to leave that question mark open at the

3925.24 --> 3929.1699999999996
end I kind of understand where he's

3926.77 --> 3931.36
coming from because if he then at the

3929.17 --> 3933.55
end he disclaim like yeah so the

3931.36 --> 3936.4
conclusion is we I say they didn't go

3933.55 --> 3938.86
period acid you know then it's gonna be

3936.4 --> 3941.35
a lot of doors shut down for him some

3938.86 --> 3943.48
people wanna want the argument open so

3941.35 --> 3944.71
he kind of leave dad push him mark open

3943.48 --> 3946.72
at the end you know he said just

3944.71 --> 3948.31
watching my video and I'll give you my

3946.72 --> 3949.8999999999996
opinion on it but he's not gonna

3948.31 --> 3953.32
disclaim at the end I don't think he

3949.9 --> 3956.4700000000003
will it is the time now because as I

3953.32 --> 3959.26
said before D the moon-landing being

3956.47 --> 3961.2099999999996
faked is now becoming sub mainstream it

3959.26 --> 3964.15
has been for a while come on guys in

3961.21 --> 3967.12
2010 there was an amazing science

3964.15 --> 3969.2200000000003
fiction movie called interstellar where

3967.12 --> 3974.14
they literally shoved it in your face

3969.22 --> 3978.31
like it was history yeah that was 2010

3974.14 --> 3981.8799999999997
okay I never watched that movie really

3978.31 --> 3984.06
what's 2010 no it wasn't - that was 2014

3981.88 --> 3987.6
sorry excuse me

3984.06 --> 3990.07
yeah interstellar it is amazing

3987.6 --> 3992.83
yeah and they play in they say in that

3990.07 --> 3995.52
movie that's romantic a fake is that the

3992.83 --> 3998.37
one with Matthew McConaughey yes

3995.52 --> 4000.44
okay it's pretty good it's long movies

3998.37 --> 4002.81
but once you start getting a all of it

4000.44 --> 4005.2400000000002
the first half an hour then you will get

4002.81 --> 4009.2599999999998
interesting anything we go watch I like

4005.24 --> 4012.7099999999996
every part of the science fiction things

4009.26 --> 4016.94
that they deal with is freaking amazing

4012.71 --> 4020.27
they deal with black hole time delay

4016.94 --> 4022.46
that it is such a high end science

4020.27 --> 4025.79
fiction setting for space station it is

4022.46 --> 4028.07
like what the Star Trek thing is do with

4025.79 --> 4032.15
like separate episode oh look normally

4028.07 --> 4035.27
but yeah in this case it's like yeah we

4032.15 --> 4037.37
know about the anomalies and this is

4035.27 --> 4040.09
what's actually gonna happen it is such

4037.37 --> 4042.83
a new level into that science fiction

4040.09 --> 4045.11
approach and it is beautiful and the

4042.83 --> 4048.2
music is awesome and the atmosphere is

4045.11 --> 4053.78
exhilarating especially in the second

4048.2 --> 4058.3599999999997
half oof I love that movie angel of

4053.78 --> 4058.36
attack in church angel of attack

4063.37 --> 4073.33
but yeah it's happening there is

4068.91 --> 4074.98
progress in the narrative yeah it is

4073.33 --> 4076.69
good that the moon landings are being

4074.98 --> 4078.64
talked about so much because that's like

4076.69 --> 4082.18
the doorway into it all you know

4078.64 --> 4086.5899999999997
questioning NASA well it probably also

4082.18 --> 4089.3199999999997
has to do with the reliability of it as

4086.59 --> 4093.52
a narrative in this age because it is

4089.32 --> 4094.1800000000003
part of like the pry the u.s. pride

4093.52 --> 4097.12
thing

4094.18 --> 4099.22
it really is still it's so embarrassing

4097.12 --> 4104.13
every time that that to hear Trump still

4099.22 --> 4104.13
trying to praise that it is like dude

4107.43 --> 4114.700000000001
but it doesn't matter whose is it

4111.66 --> 4116.68
constantly now he uses it more than ever

4114.7 --> 4120.4
it is totally embarrassing

4116.68 --> 4124.27
he's literally pandering to the to the

4120.4 --> 4128.1089999999995
dumb it's how to keep people you know

4124.27 --> 4131.1900000000005
got a woman fever there is trolling NASA

4128.109 --> 4131.1900000000005
I don't know

4131.46 --> 4139.69
Siri trolling NASA look how much going

4135.43 --> 4142.839
on look how much is there any stop to

4139.69 --> 4147.25
the funding towards NASA do you think

4142.839 --> 4147.97
this Chinese thing helped or hurt this

4147.25 --> 4150.46
narrative

4147.97 --> 4154.92
I mean why why would they decide all of

4150.46 --> 4158.14
a sudden now to do this Chinese Bishop

4154.92 --> 4161.02
what do you think was sorry you're

4158.14 --> 4163.54
breaking up what do you did this Chinese

4161.02 --> 4168.3
landing what do you think is the meaning

4163.54 --> 4169.45
behind that like do you think dominant

4168.3 --> 4172.96
dominance

4169.45 --> 4174.6089999999995
look the entire space cosmos concept and

4172.96 --> 4176.29
the International Space Station the

4174.609 --> 4180.85
cooperation despite everything on earth

4176.29 --> 4183.339
it's always just the dominating

4180.85 --> 4186.79
narrative and it has been decided by the

4183.339 --> 4191.7699999999995
New World Order decades ago that China

4186.79 --> 4194.23
will rule the world just as America

4191.77 --> 4198.040000000001
longer though decided they would rule

4194.23 --> 4200.589999999999
the world and yeah so so then my

4198.04 --> 4202.63
question is then why hot like now as a

4200.59 --> 4204.76
how how is Russia cool with that because

4202.63 --> 4207.9400000000005
we're we weren't we in this whole space

4204.76 --> 4210.49
race with Russia and all that and they

4207.94 --> 4213.4
didn't they supposedly beat us into

4210.49 --> 4217.33
space right so then we land on the moon

4213.4 --> 4219.7
and then what Russia just gives up it's

4217.33 --> 4222.37
very simple and anything on the moon is

4219.7 --> 4223.36
very simple it's very simple it's very

4222.37 --> 4227.23
simple

4223.36 --> 4229.839999999999
Russia is okay with it because they are

4227.23 --> 4241.45
pretty much in control of their

4229.84 --> 4243.34
situation they look everything they put

4241.45 --> 4246.5199999999995
out and I'll keep a look at this

4243.34 --> 4250.09
everything Russia puts out considering

4246.52 --> 4253.63
space is beautiful it's very well

4250.09 --> 4256.38
thought out they are the winners when it

4253.63 --> 4260.71
comes to science fiction they are the

4256.38 --> 4262.3
absolute and disputed winners by a march

4260.71 --> 4265.09
of fifty years

4262.3 --> 4266.8
winners in everything they do concerning

4265.09 --> 4269.47
space concerning science fiction

4266.8 --> 4273.610000000001
concerning rocketry concerning weaponry

4269.47 --> 4277.84
even okay so they don't give a [ __ ]

4273.61 --> 4282.82
about rule endings they know they're not

4277.84 --> 4285.34
gonna open themselves up like that to be

4282.82 --> 4289.389999999999
a vulnerable part of this overarching

4285.34 --> 4291.13
narrative in a world where that those

4289.39 --> 4293.9800000000005
people that actually uphold this

4291.13 --> 4297.400000000001
narrative have set their minds and

4293.98 --> 4300.82
Will's on destroying the Russian Empire

4297.4 --> 4303.549999999999
as it is in this format okay

4300.82 --> 4305.7699999999995
and there are factions of Russia that

4303.55 --> 4307.96
have clearly said for years that they

4305.77 --> 4310.0
don't believe that Americans went to the

4307.96 --> 4311.65
moon either well there's a lot of

4310.0 --> 4313.9
Americans that didn't believe that they

4311.65 --> 4317.469999999999
went to the moon so it's all a matter of

4313.9 --> 4321.91
how much is that forwarded how much is

4317.47 --> 4324.16
that being allowed to spread so so now

4321.91 --> 4324.94
I'm trying to so now how does China fit

4324.16 --> 4327.58
in with

4324.94 --> 4329.589999999999
throwing their because wait didn't China

4327.58 --> 4332.11
had supposedly didn't they have some

4329.59 --> 4336.01
type of landing a few years ago or am I

4332.11 --> 4339.82
mistaken because I could have sworn I

4336.01 --> 4342.31
heard years ago they had some type of

4339.82 --> 4344.38
landing or something that wasn't it was

4342.31 --> 4347.77
like some Jade something I'm not even

4344.38 --> 4348.34
sure I remember it was on a meteor then

4347.77 --> 4350.9800000000005
chop it

4348.34 --> 4354.7300000000005
can you hear any of us when you talk

4350.98 --> 4357.82
because it seems like no it's a little

4354.73 --> 4360.969999999999
hold on why you can't hear me now it's

4357.82 --> 4363.099999999999
rather out that every time I try to

4360.97 --> 4366.610000000001
respond she it seems like you down here

4363.1 --> 4367.030000000001
that I'm responding so it's not your

4366.61 --> 4370.21
fault

4367.03 --> 4372.91
she's saying but I think that China like

4370.21 --> 4374.71
landed a lander on it on a rock or

4372.91 --> 4377.139999999999
something on some kind of meteor or a

4374.71 --> 4380.37
comment I think that was that not too

4377.14 --> 4383.9800000000005
sure it's so much stuff yeah was a

4380.37 --> 4390.67
Rosetta where they landed on some type

4383.98 --> 4393.219999999999
of asteroid or yeah rocket I mean lady

4390.67 --> 4395.59
or asteroid something like that but they

4393.22 --> 4398.97
landed some probe on it I think it was

4395.59 --> 4398.97
pulled of those dead of something

4404.82 --> 4410.679999999999
incidental it's not very picked at all

4408.28 --> 4412.929999999999
and then well the other thing with the

4410.68 --> 4416.530000000001
whole China Space Station right that was

4412.93 --> 4419.110000000001
willfully falling out of orbit like I

4416.53 --> 4422.44
mean that sounds like it's so ridiculous

4419.11 --> 4425.469999999999
but that's the old old it was all in was

4422.44 --> 4427.719999999999
shitty it was too low quality and it

4425.47 --> 4430.42
couldn't do any other what so where is

4427.72 --> 4433.63
it did it fall they come out of orbit

4430.42 --> 4438.33
and whether that happen it crashed

4433.63 --> 4442.6900000000005
didn't see liver while they say so they

4438.33 --> 4446.0199999999995
probably recovered any wreckage if

4442.69 --> 4448.089999999999
there's any of course nothing ever

4446.02 --> 4450.790000000001
happened because nothing ever floated up

4448.09 --> 4452.92
there the only thing that actually came

4450.79 --> 4454.9
down are the rocket parts that were

4452.92 --> 4457.12
supposedly used to send all these parts

4454.9 --> 4457.66
up in space and they crashed all in the

4457.12 --> 4460.15
ocean

4457.66 --> 4464.65
but yeah officially it has crashed down

4460.15 --> 4466.48
yes while there is hope like people

4464.65 --> 4469.36
believe in this space travel

4466.48 --> 4471.49
bullshitting is possible and we can save

4469.36 --> 4473.53
the war but by going to all the wards

4471.49 --> 4475.66
and all that [ __ ] they're gonna do it

4473.53 --> 4477.429999999999
for two reasons one economically because

4475.66 --> 4479.7699999999995
they have a shitload of business in the

4477.43 --> 4482.05
space industry even though it's fake and

4479.77 --> 4483.88
hope some of the big leaders like maybe

4482.05 --> 4485.83
Trump he said like yeah I'm gonna keep

4483.88 --> 4488.05
trolling with the space travel because

4485.83 --> 4489.88
that gives people hopes and yes those

4488.05 --> 4491.53
believers on space you know they're

4489.88 --> 4493.87
gonna keep following me because I'm

4491.53 --> 4496.2699999999995
pushing this this space travel [ __ ]

4493.87 --> 4498.22
and then just Santa the second thing

4496.27 --> 4500.9800000000005
Santa is real because I put a video on

4498.22 --> 4503.47
my channel a whole mess a video and as I

4500.98 --> 4506.919999999999
stop that I think Santa Claus is real so

4503.47 --> 4510.7300000000005
it's not bad it's not no I wanted to

4506.92 --> 4513.79
respond it's not yes hope it is not just

4510.73 --> 4516.879999999999
hope it is also a method to suppress

4513.79 --> 4520.69
consciousness because if there is an

4516.88 --> 4523.81
endless room out there with fasts a vast

4520.69 --> 4526.24
amount of planets it does if you believe

4523.81 --> 4530.200000000001
that if you are certain in your mind of

4526.24 --> 4534.219999999999
that then you will have much much less

4530.2 --> 4536.74
objections in breaking down destroying

4534.22 --> 4539.9800000000005
whatever you need to accomplish some

4536.74 --> 4541.9
short-term goal here on earth because

4539.98 --> 4543.25
yeah doesn't matter if it's all

4541.9 --> 4545.95
destroyed doesn't matter if it's all

4543.25 --> 4547.93
dead you know if this long as you have a

4545.95 --> 4550.38
couple of cells you just go to another

4547.93 --> 4553.42
planet and show these seeds and

4550.38 --> 4555.91
terraform it and it'll be alright it's

4553.42 --> 4558.91
it it won't be a problem that the entire

4555.91 --> 4561.3099999999995
Earth is completely dead and irrevocably

4558.91 --> 4564.639999999999
poisoned and all that [ __ ] because

4561.31 --> 4568.56
there's another planet up there so okay

4564.64 --> 4572.71
you know so yeah it gives people

4568.56 --> 4575.68
industrialists ambitious destructive

4572.71 --> 4578.83
maniacs with their insane construction

4575.68 --> 4582.240000000001
projects that are just unreasonable it

4578.83 --> 4586.18
gives them free rein to destroy

4582.24 --> 4588.219999999999
everything because there's the dream and

4586.18 --> 4590.7390000000005
the dream makes everything all right and

4588.22 --> 4593.38
that's a subject that I

4590.739 --> 4595.928999999999
really was raving on at the beginning of

4593.38 --> 4598.3
this show and that is the biggest

4595.929 --> 4601.4490000000005
problem that is the biggest problem that

4598.3 --> 4603.849
as long as this dream of outer space and

4601.449 --> 4608.018999999999
endless possibility in endless expansion

4603.849 --> 4611.26
is out there that will allow the people

4608.019 --> 4614.400000000001
on the ground here to get stuck in this

4611.26 --> 4617.820000000001
dream and then allow themselves to

4614.4 --> 4621.159
bypass their consciousness and destroy

4617.82 --> 4623.199
everything around them because it's okay

4621.159 --> 4627.429
because there's always more out there

4623.199 --> 4629.138999999999
and that is the biggest problem that is

4627.429 --> 4635.1990000000005
the satanic killer

4629.139 --> 4637.719
that is the satanic killer inside do you

4635.199 --> 4639.94
understand that is the biggest problem

4637.719 --> 4643.269
of all I wanna hear I want to hear Karen

4639.94 --> 4645.789
Karen opinion Karen a space trouble and

4643.269 --> 4648.280000000001
the agencies different agencies around

4645.789 --> 4655.079
the world pushing this what do you think

4648.28 --> 4657.969
about it well I mean to me it's like I

4655.079 --> 4659.619
would think that they're all in the back

4657.969 --> 4663.76
and behind the scenes in on it together

4659.619 --> 4665.44
I mean why wouldn't they be you're

4663.76 --> 4667.119000000001
talking about all these major if you

4665.44 --> 4670.03
look into like all the families and

4667.119 --> 4673.21
stuff that are supposedly have the most

4670.03 --> 4674.98
power in the world I mean China it has

4673.21 --> 4679.119
one of those families they're one of the

4674.98 --> 4680.44
biggest families one yeah well I don't

4679.119 --> 4681.61
know they probably have they write it

4680.44 --> 4682.839999999999
they have more but that's what I'm

4681.61 --> 4684.4
saying like all these countries that

4682.84 --> 4686.38
we're talking about that have these

4684.4 --> 4689.558999999999
space programs they also have these

4686.38 --> 4691.749
families that control everything I mean

4689.559 --> 4695.650000000001
they're all in it it would have to be in

4691.749 --> 4697.389
all together because I mean when if one

4695.65 --> 4699.098999999999
found out that the other couldn't get

4697.389 --> 4701.2300000000005
into space or could it get to the moon

4699.099 --> 4702.82
they would just blow each other up you

4701.23 --> 4706.178999999999
know it would they would say it look

4702.82 --> 4710.308999999999
America's ever went to the moon but I'm

4706.179 --> 4710.309
saying that you know

4710.65 --> 4719.299999999999
you know and I was just looking I was

4714.02 --> 4721.150000000001
looking at missions to the moon and all

4719.3 --> 4723.92
the ones that have gone on recently and

4721.15 --> 4726.049999999999
it's like in it it's like if you look at

4723.92 --> 4727.719
the list of missions to the moon it's

4726.05 --> 4730.429
like they're all it's like Russia

4727.719 --> 4733.25
America and China it's like they're all

4730.429 --> 4734.96
taking turns with like a couple of

4733.25 --> 4737.21
random countries thrown in there for

4734.96 --> 4739.969
good measure like Japan JAXA does some

4737.21 --> 4742.429
stuff it's like it's like they all just

4739.969 --> 4747.349
kind of take turns putting on a little

4742.429 --> 4755.54
show for everybody you know the

4747.349 --> 4759.9490000000005
narrative exactly yeah pretty sad in

4755.54 --> 4765.15
2019 so can't get any HD something as

4759.949 --> 4775.589999999999
close as the one it's pretty sad

4765.15 --> 4776.5199999999995
ah angel of attack thought was being a

4775.59 --> 4779.76
smartass

4776.52 --> 4783.540000000001
like by telling me that are in sounds

4779.76 --> 4786.360000000001
like Europeans free Columbus oh gods

4783.54 --> 4788.43
such a terrible thing you know because

4786.36 --> 4792.21
yeah when Columbus happened that was the

4788.43 --> 4795.96
best thing ever you know like this

4792.21 --> 4799.26
maniac came out there it is lying maniac

4795.96 --> 4804.24
this creepy guy this pedophile rapist

4799.26 --> 4807.150000000001
and genocidal maniac was unleashed in

4804.24 --> 4809.969999999999
these lands to destroy everything and

4807.15 --> 4812.46
everything that came from that moment on

4809.97 --> 4815.52
from that approach like yeah it's okay

4812.46 --> 4818.37
to do that yeah that destroyed America

4815.52 --> 4820.38
as it was that destroyed the miraculous

4818.37 --> 4825.0599999999995
natural things that were still in

4820.38 --> 4828.6900000000005
America because of that [ __ ] because of

4825.06 --> 4833.13
Columbus okay if that never happened

4828.69 --> 4836.7
then America was probably mostly been

4833.13 --> 4838.2
the American natives now and worrying

4836.7 --> 4841.53
among one another and there would be

4838.2 --> 4844.679999999999
giant elven trees to inspire us all and

4841.53 --> 4846.87
planes flying over that and show that's

4844.68 --> 4849.96
like yeah there are still trees here

4846.87 --> 4851.97
that are like 20 meters thick and a

4849.96 --> 4854.1
couple of kilometers high they're still

4851.97 --> 4855.990000000001
out here isn't that amazing that we

4854.1 --> 4858.450000000001
still have that so yeah you can thank

4855.99 --> 4861.48
Columbus for that you can thank the

4858.45 --> 4863.82
nobility of Europe the Spanish Queen and

4861.48 --> 4868.7699999999995
the British Queen and the King of France

4863.82 --> 4873.59
and all of them for deciding to destroy

4868.77 --> 4877.92
all of that permanently and and erase it

4873.59 --> 4882.81
from cultural memory so yeah thanks

4877.92 --> 4886.59
thanks for destroying more things it's

4882.81 --> 4888.96
so lovely cuz we're so happy with it

4886.59 --> 4892.68
before before we go of this space

4888.96 --> 4895.53
subject I wanna shout out I still as for

4892.68 --> 4898.83
today my personal opinion the person

4895.53 --> 4899.04
that has dismantled NASA are exposing

4898.83 --> 4902.28
for

4899.04 --> 4904.53
the liars they are if journalism still

4902.28 --> 4906.9
that was one of the first person that I

4904.53 --> 4909.78
start watching when I start watching him

4906.9 --> 4912.36
just exposed and I'm talking about

4909.78 --> 4914.9
details about this the speed that these

4912.36 --> 4918.17
Rockets are supposed to take off the

4914.9 --> 4921.12
spacewalks they details the money they

4918.17 --> 4923.49
everything I mean some people have come

4921.12 --> 4925.32
to this fluttered in the last year year

4923.49 --> 4926.94
and a half two years and they have

4925.32 --> 4930.09
watched maybe year anism in the new

4926.94 --> 4933.21
stuff go visit his older videos because

4930.09 --> 4935.97
he exposes NASA up big time so big shout

4933.21 --> 4938.91
out to you you still doing it gern but

4935.97 --> 4941.31
you did a great before me and I continue

4938.91 --> 4944.8099999999995
doing it but that's my personal opinion

4941.31 --> 4948.150000000001
you know okay great yeah I want to

4944.81 --> 4951.39
continue like angle angel of attack

4948.15 --> 4953.3099999999995
keeps on responding to this saying oh if

4951.39 --> 4955.860000000001
it hasn't been kelabra Stan somebody

4953.31 --> 4958.47
else would have discovered it well guess

4955.86 --> 4963.54
what he didn't discover it it was

4958.47 --> 4967.25
discovered okay it was discovered and

4963.54 --> 4970.98
partially colonized there were many many

4967.25 --> 4974.55
Irish settlers that were on the East

4970.98 --> 4977.16
Coast and pretty much over America for

4974.55 --> 4980.28
several generations already during that

4977.16 --> 4984.47
time and they were basically just killed

4980.28 --> 4984.469999999999
all of them most of them or they were

4984.95 --> 4992.04
enslaved or joined whatever came across

4990.24 --> 4996.09
the sea but it is because of the

4992.04 --> 4998.79
nobility they decided to conquer what

4996.09 --> 5002.42
was there that was the decision it's not

4998.79 --> 5004.76
a discovery they came and they conquered

5002.42 --> 5007.91
it and then they murdered everyone and

5004.76 --> 5010.360000000001
they destroyed everything and rewrote

5007.91 --> 5013.34
history to make them look like

5010.36 --> 5015.7699999999995
discoverers and oh look we've

5013.34 --> 5017.57
enlightened because now we've discovered

5015.77 --> 5020.900000000001
the world is bigger and all doesn't that

5017.57 --> 5023.87
make us look good but they were in

5020.9 --> 5026.75
conquest they were there to claim to

5023.87 --> 5029.0599999999995
destroy and murder that's what really

5026.75 --> 5031.01
happened back then has nothing to do

5029.06 --> 5033.38
with

5031.01 --> 5036.8
okay [ __ ] slavery has been around

5033.38 --> 5038.4490000000005
everywhere always every people have been

5036.8 --> 5042.110000000001
enslaved every race

5038.449 --> 5044.54
that's the aftermath that situation of

5042.11 --> 5049.5199999999995
the aftermath of after everything was

5044.54 --> 5052.219
destroyed but the Portuguese and the

5049.52 --> 5055.67
Spanish and the French and the English

5052.219 --> 5059.6
they didn't discover America it was

5055.67 --> 5063.5
discovered it was colonized partially

5059.6 --> 5066.2300000000005
there were native colonized colonization

5063.5 --> 5069.14
for a long time stemming perhaps from

5066.23 --> 5071.928999999999
the tartarean empire or from the Incan

5069.14 --> 5076.34
Empire there were the Irish they settled

5071.929 --> 5079.82
there there were the majority and

5076.34 --> 5082.82
inaudible for them north Europeans were

5079.82 --> 5087.08
Mexicans here the Vikings were all over

5082.82 --> 5091.009999999999
North America okay and yeah the Incas

5087.08 --> 5094.219
the yeah the Mexicans you could there is

5091.01 --> 5096.52
evidence of many many different types of

5094.219 --> 5099.32
people being in America long before

5096.52 --> 5104.179
Columbus hundreds and hundreds of years

5099.32 --> 5107.0599999999995
before Columbus indeed but I'm also

5104.179 --> 5112.4800000000005
saying whether they're Nathan natives

5107.06 --> 5115.909000000001
were there America was already known

5112.48 --> 5119.989
colonists already went there for

5115.909 --> 5122.78
centuries so it's a lie it is all a lie

5119.989 --> 5126.32
that it was discovered it was simply

5122.78 --> 5133.09
conquered it was conquered and history

5126.32 --> 5137.12
was rewritten that is what happened and

5133.09 --> 5140.81
the rest is old dreams so dreams for for

5137.12 --> 5143.09
12 year old kids in schools to glorify

5140.81 --> 5146.38
the past and think that everything is

5143.09 --> 5146.38
alright it's not

5147.15 --> 5155.089999999999
wasn't anyway

5151.96 --> 5158.449
[Applause]

5155.09 --> 5160.610000000001
oh we've been going for one and a half

5158.449 --> 5168.71
hour already it's awesome

5160.61 --> 5171.259999999999
oh god Joseph Smith oh dear

5168.71 --> 5174.2300000000005
yeah let's try to fit the Joseph Smith

5171.26 --> 5176.4490000000005
story in America that's be very

5174.23 --> 5178.879999999999
interesting in this country context

5176.449 --> 5182.54
although yeah the funny thing about the

5178.88 --> 5185.4490000000005
whole mormon story and the pre american

5182.54 --> 5187.88
civilization you know what when you

5185.449 --> 5192.3099999999995
think about it in this context that

5187.88 --> 5194.63
makes so much more sense because yeah

5192.31 --> 5198.26
according to the mormon story

5194.63 --> 5201.29
there were colonists there before the

5198.26 --> 5204.38
decolonization so yeah it kind of

5201.29 --> 5207.17
doesn't work where do you believe all of

5204.38 --> 5210.59
that or the religious aspects of those

5207.17 --> 5215.06
stories is another matter but yeah there

5210.59 --> 5219.4890000000005
were colonists in America in North

5215.06 --> 5226.119000000001
America way before the colonisation so

5219.489 --> 5228.678999999999
just a fact it's funny how some of these

5226.119 --> 5231.08
writings no matter how controversial

5228.679 --> 5237.469
actually make more sense when you

5231.08 --> 5239.929
realize that yeah anyway I think I'm

5237.469 --> 5240.83
gonna round out the show if you guys are

5239.929 --> 5242.57
okay with that

5240.83 --> 5244.24

5242.57 --> 5248.21

5244.24 --> 5252.44
