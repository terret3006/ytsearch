7.63 --> 37.52
[Music]

61.699 --> 66.439
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

65.22 --> 69.78
bird number

66.439 --> 71.46
1188 I'm your host Arwin and before we

69.78 --> 73.74
start the show please don't forget to

71.46 --> 76.259

82.68 --> 87.54
weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam time in the

84.96 --> 89.52
weekend and please also do support me

87.54 --> 92.46000000000001

89.52 --> 93.96
wallets oh say it again Super Chat and

92.46 --> 97.63999999999999
the membership system join button

93.96 --> 100.759
that'll be much appreciated

97.64 --> 102.72
although I'm doing great right now

100.759 --> 105.06
thanks to the

102.72 --> 107.82
sizeable donation from Tony Whitcomb of

105.06 --> 111.119
flutter Sage yesterday

107.82 --> 113.75899999999999
I've managed to really stock back up

111.119 --> 116.82
Food Supplies and all that

113.759 --> 120.32
right so yeah the weather today is

116.82 --> 120.32
absolutely gorgeous

122.7 --> 129.179
it's like just a couple of fluffy little

125.82 --> 131.84
clouds and but just a bright blue sky in

129.179 --> 131.84
between there

133.56 --> 139.81900000000002
barely any Trails I mean some but

137.28 --> 143.239
they're not really

139.819 --> 143.23899999999998
substantial or anything

144.12 --> 151.20000000000002
and yeah almost no wind and that part is

147.54 --> 154.07999999999998
really delightful out there

151.2 --> 156.89999999999998
so yeah this is

154.08 --> 161.18
great weather to

156.9 --> 161.18
sit in the park somewhere have a picnic

166.98 --> 169.459
all right

171.9 --> 173.9
um

175.62 --> 181.37900000000002
that's it hello Crockett first in chat

178.519 --> 184.86
Delta Spirit

181.379 --> 188.34
good to see you it is Friday the 18th of

184.86 --> 188.34
March 2022.

193.5 --> 199.58
and yeah hopefully probably I'm not

196.26 --> 204.67999999999998
going to be as intense as yesterday

199.58 --> 204.68
I had a bit of the late night as well

212.28 --> 220.76
but yeah I had good dinner yesterday

217.739 --> 220.76
and uh

226.14 --> 231.319
let's I just

228.12 --> 233.9
feel a lot more comfortable

231.319 --> 237.89999999999998
compared to yesterday and the day before

233.9 --> 240.68
also I've noticed that yeah the jaw

237.9 --> 243.659
situation seems to pretty much have 100

240.68 --> 247.31900000000002
recovered now

243.659 --> 250.5
I mean it's slightly different

247.319 --> 253.07999999999998
but there is no more inflammation and

250.5 --> 254.519
seems just perfectly healed up like it

253.08 --> 256.85900000000004
can basically poke it and it doesn't

254.519 --> 261.859
even hurt

256.859 --> 261.859
so yeah that's that's a relief

261.9 --> 267.78
all right hmm

264.78 --> 269.88
so yesterday's show

267.78 --> 272.94
man

269.88 --> 277.15999999999997
yeah yesterday's was uh

272.94 --> 277.16
pretty straightforward Flat Earth

277.44 --> 284.759
and physics again episode

281.16 --> 286.97900000000004
and I got the yeah the typical amounts

284.759 --> 289.94
of uh anti-flat Earth or comment

286.979 --> 289.94
responses as well

292.32 --> 297.24
and of course they had yes some of these

295.199 --> 301.02000000000004
guys they immediately had to resort to

297.24 --> 303.84000000000003
ad homs on every single detail

301.02 --> 305.59999999999997
that they could spot to get away from

303.84 --> 308.71999999999997
the very

305.6 --> 311.34000000000003
straightforward and consistent

308.72 --> 315.0
mechanical setup that I've been

311.34 --> 318.9
presenting as to gas mechanics

315.0 --> 321.6
why it doesn't have mass effectively

318.9 --> 324.59999999999997
right it has atomic mass sure but it's

321.6 --> 326.58000000000004
not actually Mass it's more like a

324.6 --> 329.22
convention-based representation that

326.58 --> 331.8
it's not the mass that's

329.22 --> 333.3
physically used

331.8 --> 334.38
to gain weight

333.3 --> 337.62
right

334.38 --> 340.919
but yeah the way I presented was pretty

337.62 --> 344.84000000000003
much a couple of complicated

340.919 --> 344.84
things tied together

345.479 --> 351.539
so I did really like painted all in one

348.18 --> 354.74
go every time and I can do that right I

351.539 --> 354.74
am good at it because I

358.86 --> 364.34000000000003
yeah it seems like my internet was

360.66 --> 364.34000000000003
disconnecting I spotted it in time

364.5 --> 367.039
great

372.3 --> 377.88
they thought they could weigh gas yeah

374.34 --> 381.35999999999996
well the thing is Jeff gas had

377.88 --> 387.259
that George Sanford who is a flat

381.36 --> 387.259
earther was like he is always

387.72 --> 390.259
just

393.18 --> 397.38
this was just basically having a

395.46 --> 400.02
oppositional Defiance disorder I think

397.38 --> 402.44
because he's always bringing out that

400.02 --> 402.44
freaking

402.479 --> 406.039
tank of oxygen

406.38 --> 412.139
but look it's compressed it it's

409.259 --> 416.099
compressed it's not a liquid it's it's

412.139 --> 417.36
still a gas but it has weights like oh

416.099 --> 422.21999999999997
because

417.36 --> 423.84000000000003
yeah that is like one of the weirder

422.22 --> 426.0
things

423.84 --> 427.44
right but it's just the problem is if I

426.0 --> 429.06
have to address it it just makes

427.44 --> 432.319
everything really

429.06 --> 432.319
more complicated

433.68 --> 439.319
right because like we were addressing

436.38 --> 441.71999999999997
mass and weight we're already addressing

439.319 --> 444.06
conventions and he didn't he doesn't

441.72 --> 446.94000000000005
address it like that he's just like no

444.06 --> 450.3
it has weight look here it's in a tank

446.94 --> 454.139
it's still a gas it weighs more and yeah

450.3 --> 457.259
if you say it like that that's like ah

454.139 --> 459.979
that just completely ruins the entire

457.259 --> 459.97900000000004
presentation

465.24 --> 469.68
even though I'm pretty sure he's been

467.699 --> 472.379
there in the chat

469.68 --> 474.12
like dozens of times that I've explained

472.379 --> 476.819
this and he keeps doing the same thing

474.12 --> 478.62
and it doesn't seem to be willing to

476.819 --> 480.84000000000003
recognize

478.62 --> 483.5
what the convention of weight and mass

480.84 --> 483.5
even is

484.62 --> 490.4
uh

487.44 --> 490.4
it's just

491.36 --> 498.86
moving on to other elements every time I

495.12 --> 498.86
don't know hello George Sanford

500.12 --> 504.319
liquid oxygen is a thing

507.599 --> 514.3389999999999
right it it supposedly is but I think

510.9 --> 514.3389999999999
that's more because of temperature

516.18 --> 520.8
I I don't know man I don't know if it

518.7 --> 522.979
like

520.8 --> 526.1999999999999
like I haven't seen

522.979 --> 529.5600000000001
oxygen being compressed within a

526.2 --> 532.38
perfectly transparent gas tank I haven't

529.56 --> 535.4399999999999
seen that I don't even know like what's

532.38 --> 537.6
exactly going on I just know that

535.44 --> 539.94
it's a big

537.6 --> 541.86
stick in the mud and it making things

539.94 --> 545.0400000000001
more complicated

541.86 --> 547.16
because I'm relaying like

545.04 --> 550.98
I'm trying to

547.16 --> 553.62
rearrange conventions in order to get

550.98 --> 558.9590000000001
everything more correct

553.62 --> 561.3
because weight Mass gravity related mass

558.959 --> 563.399
that system it's

561.3 --> 566.88
it's imagination

563.399 --> 568.98
and it's been like really rooted in our

566.88 --> 572.22
thinking in school

568.98 --> 573.9590000000001
for multiple multiple generations and we

572.22 --> 577.2
all

573.959 --> 579.3599999999999
know how to think like that it just

577.2 --> 581.22
doesn't really work so I'm trying to

579.36 --> 583.08
re-arrange

581.22 --> 586.8000000000001
the convention

583.08 --> 588.839
to make clear that like yeah Newtonian

586.8 --> 589.8599999999999
mechanic that doesn't actually work with

588.839 --> 592.44
gas

589.86 --> 595.26
even though you can apparently

592.44 --> 597.24
compress gas and it's still a gas and

595.26 --> 599.9399999999999
then you put it on a scale and it has

597.24 --> 603.019
more weight yeah that's that just makes

599.94 --> 603.019
things more complicated

603.06 --> 608.16
okay but effectively for what I was

605.94 --> 609.24
talking about momentum

608.16 --> 611.64
yeah

609.24 --> 615.779
gas doesn't have that that's that was

611.64 --> 619.86
the main point which then points back at

615.779 --> 623.16
y air can't rotate in lockstep

619.86 --> 625.4590000000001
with Asa presupposed spherical rotating

623.16 --> 625.459
Earth

627.24 --> 631.22
anyway hello Nathan Oakley

635.519 --> 639.74
oh akumu virus in there too oh dear

643.019 --> 647.1
yeah

644.22 --> 649.279
yeah yesterday was uh was quite a show

647.1 --> 649.279
again

651.48 --> 655.04
over at flatters debate

656.82 --> 660.32
oh you're all having energy

660.66 --> 667.76
and we're alone a lot of puns in the air

664.2 --> 667.76
Pond is in the air

668.82 --> 672.38
upon is in the Earth

694.56 --> 697.399
okay

700.68 --> 703.68
virus

704.76 --> 712.639
right I just called I call him akumo

708.12 --> 712.639
virus I don't know why I just do

723.06 --> 727.279
eighth letter Sage good to see you

767.1 --> 772.26
right yeah and Delta Spirit how do they

770.579 --> 775.019
weigh gas

772.26 --> 777.06
usually by compressing it

775.019 --> 779.519
yeah

777.06 --> 782.2199999999999
you don't weigh gas in its expanded

779.519 --> 784.98
State yeah let's be clear

782.22 --> 787.26
that is part of the point

784.98 --> 789.48
they don't do that

787.26 --> 793.019
you can't why

789.48 --> 795.779
because there is nothing to weigh or it

793.019 --> 799.32
or at least it doesn't accurately

795.779 --> 803.76
represent the I guess the potential

799.32 --> 805.38
weight right so that's why when we weigh

803.76 --> 808.079
gases

805.38 --> 811.079
it's always compressed and in a tank

808.079 --> 811.079
usually

811.1 --> 817.62
compressed to yeah a liquid state

813.86 --> 821.88
sometimes against solid and sometimes

817.62 --> 825.24
it's just Compressed Gas weird

821.88 --> 827.579
they don't you don't just weigh gas in

825.24 --> 830.4590000000001
an expanded State you gotta realize that

827.579 --> 832.62
nobody weighs gas in an expanded State

830.459 --> 835.68
it's always compressed

832.62 --> 837.839
that's the standard it's like even the

835.68 --> 839.519
terminology

837.839 --> 843.0
they use

839.519 --> 844.5
is per liter

843.0 --> 846.6
yeah

844.5 --> 849.48
now it's not going to be a liter of

846.6 --> 852.839
expanded gas that's blatantly obvious I

849.48 --> 855.0600000000001
hope you realize that yeah no

852.839 --> 859.8000000000001
when you're talking about I want a liter

855.06 --> 862.199
of gas in a tank it's compressed

859.8 --> 864.7199999999999
right and then they could even like give

862.199 --> 869.54
you a number as to like this is how much

864.72 --> 869.5400000000001
expanded gas you can get out of that

871.86 --> 877.519
right

873.36 --> 877.519
this is just all very convoluted

884.16 --> 888.48
hey what do you think of the idea making

886.139 --> 892.16
daylight savings for I don't care like

888.48 --> 892.16
this is just pointless

892.86 --> 896.9590000000001
and it's not the conversation right now

908.639 --> 912.74
yeah well it's good to see you

916.139 --> 920.0
oh and turret 306

927.24 --> 931.5790000000001
seeking star water didn't miss anybody

929.339 --> 931.5790000000001
else

942.0 --> 947.639
oh man

944.639 --> 947.639
foreign

963.72 --> 968.759
so yeah I hope you guys thought that my

966.66 --> 972.5
show yesterday was informative even

968.759 --> 972.5
though the title was kind of misleading

974.279 --> 979.92
it wasn't misleading it's just

976.8 --> 982.139
another subject really

979.92 --> 983.699
which is still it's still relevant to

982.139 --> 986.16
like what's going on at the Flat Earth

983.699 --> 988.8
debate Dingle Baron dingleberry

986.16 --> 991.98
dependency is a thing

988.8 --> 993.24
it's like a mathematician's

991.98 --> 995.399
thing

993.24 --> 996.48
for the Ballers like they have to do

995.399 --> 998.579
that

996.48 --> 1001.4590000000001
right to take the flat plane and then

998.579 --> 1003.2589999999999
you imagine the ball Earth underneath

1001.459 --> 1006.7399999999999
that and right where you're standing is

1003.259 --> 1009.38
where it connects like the man is the

1006.74 --> 1011.48
connection between the flat plane and

1009.38 --> 1014.42
the dingleberry ball Earth

1011.48 --> 1016.519
that's basically the the

1014.42 --> 1019.9399999999999
internal

1016.519 --> 1022.16
thing happening the visualization of the

1019.94 --> 1025.1000000000001
baller

1022.16 --> 1026.299
yeah laugh it up Fundy dingleberry

1025.1 --> 1028.52
indeed

1026.299 --> 1029.78
it's funny isn't it because that's your

1028.52 --> 1033.079
fate

1029.78 --> 1035.8999999999999
that's your fate as a baller

1033.079 --> 1039.319
isn't that funny

1035.9 --> 1042.02
you're stuck to that action based in

1039.319 --> 1045.339
imagination for as long as you're going

1042.02 --> 1045.339
to hold on to your religion

1047.9 --> 1054.74
and I mean not just in regular life but

1051.62 --> 1057.32
in every single argument

1054.74 --> 1059.74
wrong but funny no it's not actually

1057.32 --> 1059.74
wrong

1060.86 --> 1066.32
dingleberry attic

1063.44 --> 1070.22
it's funny and it's right

1066.32 --> 1071.84
it's the Paradigm you're in forever for

1070.22 --> 1072.74
as long as you hold on to your religion

1071.84 --> 1074.84
yeah

1072.74 --> 1078.64
you got you as a person

1074.84 --> 1082.22
flat plane and then a ball underneath

1078.64 --> 1085.5800000000002
this is like almost a literal symbol at

1082.22 --> 1090.16
this point I could I could draw it out

1085.58 --> 1090.1599999999999
I could literally draw out the symbol

1090.799 --> 1093.28
see

1094.66 --> 1100.46
I could literally make jewelry with this

1098.299 --> 1101.84
symbol that is kind of the thing that I

1100.46 --> 1106.179
used to do

1101.84 --> 1106.1789999999999
huh 15 years ago

1129.74 --> 1134.78
right

1131.96 --> 1137.299
so this is it this is the symbol this is

1134.78 --> 1139.16
the symbol

1137.299 --> 1141.62
of

1139.16 --> 1145.059
what happens in you inside of you

1141.62 --> 1145.059
internally that's it

1147.08 --> 1152.48
flat plane well line it could make it

1149.96 --> 1156.7
into a stickman or whatever but I just

1152.48 --> 1156.7
thought just take a straight line

1158.96 --> 1164.0
oh

1160.64 --> 1166.3600000000001
hey butterfly look at that where did he

1164.0 --> 1166.36
come from

1171.799 --> 1174.52
oh

1174.559 --> 1179.5
I love those

1176.299 --> 1179.5
I'm gonna help it outside

1185.179 --> 1188.179
hey

1188.6 --> 1192.1999999999998
come here

1190.1 --> 1194.32
come here

1192.2 --> 1194.32
oh

1213.799 --> 1217.94
come up it's close

1216.08 --> 1219.86
it's glass

1217.94 --> 1221.299
but you can't go through there it's

1219.86 --> 1223.9399999999998
glass

1221.299 --> 1226.059
once you get it there you go

1223.94 --> 1228.4
it's

1226.059 --> 1232.76
uh

1228.4 --> 1235.8200000000002
yeah it's spring definitely oh

1232.76 --> 1239.26
so glad to see they're still around

1235.82 --> 1239.26
that's a pretty big one

1242.84 --> 1246.1399999999999
ah

1244.039 --> 1248.48
is it spring there yeah it is kind of

1246.14 --> 1252.2
spring I am in my t-shirt

1248.48 --> 1255.34
it's already like jungle temperature

1252.2 --> 1257.659
let me guess hot and moist

1255.34 --> 1260.6789999999999
yeah that's India

1257.659 --> 1260.679
so I've heard

1263.24 --> 1268.659
yeah it's 16 degrees so it's not bad not

1266.059 --> 1268.6589999999999
bad at all

1269.179 --> 1274.3400000000001
oh

1271.64 --> 1277.46
according to the prediction it's gonna

1274.34 --> 1281.059
get even warmer on Tuesday although it's

1277.46 --> 1285.2
supposedly gonna rain this Sunday

1281.059 --> 1287.8999999999999
it says 18 degrees Celsius from Tuesday

1285.2 --> 1291.44
on so

1287.9 --> 1294.159
I guess spring really is coming back

1291.44 --> 1294.159
hmm

1298.4 --> 1304.659
Sahara dust nothing good comes from that

1301.34 --> 1304.6589999999999
why not rake back

1306.74 --> 1310.059
I mean what's wrong with it

1319.34 --> 1324.1399999999999
man upside down that's interesting

1322.159 --> 1327.0800000000002
that's interesting seeking star water

1324.14 --> 1329.2990000000002
that you would see that in this that's

1327.08 --> 1333.559
very interesting

1329.299 --> 1336.7
I get it yeah you'd see it like a head

1333.559 --> 1336.7
it's fascinating

1336.799 --> 1341.9189999999999
right what if I actually do draw it into

1339.2 --> 1341.919
a stick figure

1344.539 --> 1350.26
then it becomes even weirder and it's

1347.059 --> 1350.26
like a man and a man

1364.64 --> 1368.6200000000001
let me correct that

1381.82 --> 1386.1399999999999
and you'd get something like this

1392.179 --> 1399.7
which yeah

1395.059 --> 1399.7
but anyway that's that was the concept

1400.52 --> 1403.72
dingleberry Earth

1407.299 --> 1412.7
it's always a ball visualizing that ball

1410.659 --> 1415.88
underneath

1412.7 --> 1417.6200000000001
the flat plane that is intrical

1415.88 --> 1419.7800000000002
right you need that flat plane that's

1417.62 --> 1422.9599999999998
where all the data comes from

1419.78 --> 1426.02
but then you'll still imagine that ball

1422.96 --> 1429.02
and basically touching

1426.02 --> 1431.36
right where you stand on Earth that's

1429.02 --> 1434.179
where you that's basically where you

1431.36 --> 1437.9599999999998
stand is the tangent

1434.179 --> 1441.6200000000001
of the imaginary ball Earth underneath

1437.96 --> 1443.38
the actual flat plane where you stand is

1441.62 --> 1448.3999999999999
right where that all connects and that's

1443.38 --> 1450.94
basically what what this symbolizes

1448.4 --> 1450.94
right

1456.38 --> 1462.6200000000001
is that why graduates get those hats

1459.44 --> 1465.559
that's freaking hilarious that's that's

1462.62 --> 1467.779
actually really freaking funny

1465.559 --> 1470.0
because it is kind of like a flat plane

1467.779 --> 1472.7
with a ball against it isn't it

1470.0 --> 1474.98
that's that's hilarious

1472.7 --> 1479.98
clap Rockets thank you for that

1474.98 --> 1479.98
huh ah damn it my camera is frozen again

1486.559 --> 1491.2
all right

1488.36 --> 1491.1999999999998
I'm back

1496.4 --> 1499.8400000000001
are you pooping

1506.38 --> 1512.6200000000001
it seems some very serious ball tires

1510.08 --> 1512.62
have arrived

1512.779 --> 1518.6
I guess they are now actually taking the

1515.059 --> 1521.059
effort to make an account then subscribe

1518.6 --> 1523.4189999999999
just to say something unbelievably

1521.059 --> 1523.4189999999999
stupid

1527.72 --> 1531.679
I can't believe this guy actually has

1530.179 --> 1536.48
subscribers

1531.679 --> 1538.96
like who who would do that

1536.48 --> 1538.96
whatever

1546.38 --> 1554.44
the cut out of a huge Earth

1552.02 --> 1559.4
uh

1554.44 --> 1563.659
yeah you mean it's a a flat

1559.4 --> 1566.539
cut out of the huge Earth I live on yeah

1563.659 --> 1569.0590000000002
I agree huge flat Earth because if you

1566.539 --> 1571.82
take a cut out it's flat

1569.059 --> 1574.82
that's not gonna turn into a ball

1571.82 --> 1577.6399999999999
right you can think of it as being a bow

1574.82 --> 1580.6399999999999
and that's how you end up

1577.64 --> 1583.64
on a dingleberry dependency

1580.64 --> 1586.4
yeah because yeah that that flat line

1583.64 --> 1588.44
that's the actual Earth that's the flat

1586.4 --> 1590.48
line you're standing on yeah that ball

1588.44 --> 1592.4
underneath there that's what you have to

1590.48 --> 1595.039
visualize

1592.4 --> 1598.779
what it's supposed to be

1595.039 --> 1598.779
that's dingleberry dependency

1600.799 --> 1609.7
what a huge oh it's so big you mean that

1605.12 --> 1609.6999999999998
the ball Earth is so big it's all flat

1611.84 --> 1618.4599999999998
Applause everybody Applause for Adam l

1615.32 --> 1618.46
welcome to Flat Earth

1618.919 --> 1625.3600000000001
he's on such a huge ball it's actually

1621.799 --> 1628.1589999999999
flat right because if a sphere is so big

1625.36 --> 1631.3999999999999
it's everything's just flat right that's

1628.159 --> 1634.88
how geometry works if the sphere is big

1631.4 --> 1637.88
enough it's all just flat

1634.88 --> 1637.88
right

1644.539 --> 1647.32
uh

1658.7 --> 1663.1000000000001
oh God this is actually funny now

1665.72 --> 1671.059
squirt alert yep

1669.02 --> 1673.34
it's like I'm not even gonna get upset

1671.059 --> 1675.46
at that it's just really funny at this

1673.34 --> 1679.399
point it is

1675.46 --> 1682.039
I'm glad I can enjoy it

1679.399 --> 1684.5
no it's it's much much less in no

1682.039 --> 1687.559
enjoyable when you're surrounded by

1684.5 --> 1690.679
delusional numpties when you yourself

1687.559 --> 1692.1789999999999
are like poor and feel like I'm not

1690.679 --> 1695.539
doing good enough and that's why I'm

1692.179 --> 1697.52
hungry right but now today I feel just I

1695.539 --> 1699.22
don't have that problem so it's it's

1697.52 --> 1703.4189999999999
just just

1699.22 --> 1703.419
ridiculously hilarious now

1703.52 --> 1707.74
I'm glad I can enjoy it in this moment

1708.2 --> 1710.8600000000001
ah

1710.899 --> 1715.4189999999999
it's so round it looks flat

1715.64 --> 1722.0200000000002
yeah how how many flat planes does it

1718.34 --> 1722.02
make take to make a sphere

1723.02 --> 1727.46
but I mean

1724.399 --> 1731.9799999999998
it's all dingleberry dependency guys it

1727.46 --> 1731.98
is it really is because whether this is

1736.34 --> 1741.6399999999999
I almost pissed yourself yeah I know you

1739.52 --> 1741.6399999999999
did

1742.039 --> 1748.299
this is what happens when you squirt too

1744.86 --> 1748.299
much in your life

1748.88 --> 1752.98
start to gain issues down there

1771.799 --> 1778.34
playing is only for visual Ed no

1775.399 --> 1781.6999999999998
no it is in that cool mood it's

1778.34 --> 1786.3799999999999
geometric it's not for a visual aid it's

1781.7 --> 1790.3990000000001
literal it's mathematical it's geometric

1786.38 --> 1793.279
it's the thing that you actually use

1790.399 --> 1795.6789999999999
to create your imaginary globe with

1793.279 --> 1797.48
mathematically and geometrically

1795.679 --> 1800.8600000000001
you're a dingleberry dependent and

1797.48 --> 1800.8600000000001
there's nothing you can do about it

1804.559 --> 1808.299
that's just the way it is

1810.5 --> 1817.22
it's the only way to do it

1813.26 --> 1820.76
it's how it was designed

1817.22 --> 1824.8990000000001
so how did the Jesuits figure it out

1820.76 --> 1827.48
like 500 years ago that's how you do it

1824.899 --> 1829.82
and the biggest trick was how do we get

1827.48 --> 1831.98
them to do it without realizing they're

1829.82 --> 1835.059
doing it

1831.98 --> 1835.059
keeping it simple

1835.82 --> 1842.62
dingleberry Earth

1837.94 --> 1842.6200000000001
this is the symbol this is it

1842.96 --> 1846.88
this is what's happening in your mind

1850.46 --> 1855.6200000000001
we'll take a good look

1852.98 --> 1858.46
is this your religion this is what

1855.62 --> 1858.4599999999998
happens in your mind

1860.33 --> 1863.57
[Applause]

1877.46 --> 1883.64
it's good to get back into

1881.6 --> 1886.399
that old profession

1883.64 --> 1888.94
symbols I could literally make a jewel

1886.399 --> 1888.9399999999998
out of that

1891.32 --> 1898.039
and it wouldn't wear that Jewel though

1894.679 --> 1900.14
although maybe if I was like at a ball

1898.039 --> 1903.039
win convention or something I would

1900.14 --> 1903.039
probably wear it

1903.26 --> 1909.5
I mean it would look pretty cool and

1906.519 --> 1914.0
what if somebody actually asks hey what

1909.5 --> 1915.62
is that oh God oh God are they gonna be

1914.0 --> 1918.62
shocked

1915.62 --> 1918.62
anyway

1921.5 --> 1927.7
or else Fool's Day

1924.38 --> 1927.7
yeah it's just uh

1929.059 --> 1934.1589999999999
in a little under two weeks from now

1931.46 --> 1936.3400000000001
already no it's exactly two weeks from

1934.159 --> 1936.3400000000001
now

1938.899 --> 1942.1589999999999
dingleberry t-shirt

1951.74 --> 1955.82
at least at a baller convention we will

1954.799 --> 1958.1
know

1955.82 --> 1960.86
who don't belong

1958.1 --> 1963.1399999999999
what you mean like a cult

1960.86 --> 1966.799
you know your cult members you know how

1963.14 --> 1969.0800000000002
to exclude non-cult members

1966.799 --> 1971.36
I bet you do I mean that's your

1969.08 --> 1973.34
specialization that's what you do as

1971.36 --> 1976.9399999999998
Ballers right Ballers aren't actually

1973.34 --> 1979.9399999999998
about the mechanical or

1976.94 --> 1979.94
arguments

1980.12 --> 1984.4399999999998
it's more about

1982.34 --> 1987.1399999999999
how do you

1984.44 --> 1990.44
keep order How do you

1987.14 --> 1992.96
keep people in line

1990.44 --> 1995.14
with peer pressure and how do you trick

1992.96 --> 1995.14
yourself

1995.419 --> 2000.5800000000002
right how do you keep tricking yourself

1997.64 --> 2001.72
and how can you show others how to trick

2000.58 --> 2004.36
themselves

2001.72 --> 2006.94
it's all social trickery right most of

2004.36 --> 2008.6789999999999
the globe religion is all about peers

2006.94 --> 2011.8600000000001
and trickery

2008.679 --> 2013.8400000000001
how to fool yourself and the others on a

2011.86 --> 2015.58
voluntary basis of course because yeah

2013.84 --> 2016.899
you need to be fooled if you want to

2015.58 --> 2019.48
believe in the ball

2016.899 --> 2024.399
so that's what your main focus is you're

2019.48 --> 2027.76
all very very effective in analyzing how

2024.399 --> 2029.559
to derail a situation socially not

2027.76 --> 2031.48
through argumentation

2029.559 --> 2034.24
but by playing

2031.48 --> 2038.2
on people's confusion

2034.24 --> 2040.72
on people's unrest on their yeah their

2038.2 --> 2043.539
inner personal conflicts whatever you

2040.72 --> 2047.14
can do and you're very good at that

2043.539 --> 2049.3
you're all trained to do that

2047.14 --> 2051.339
right it's not even something that you

2049.3 --> 2052.9190000000003
directly talk about maybe to make fun of

2051.339 --> 2055.2999999999997
them when you all feel a bit

2052.919 --> 2057.399
uncomfortable with yourselves

2055.3 --> 2060.46
because too much light's been shining on

2057.399 --> 2063.2799999999997
your on your trickery

2060.46 --> 2066.52
but you're all very focused

2063.28 --> 2069.7000000000003
on that and you will accept that like

2066.52 --> 2072.7599999999998
yeah you analyze flat earthers in order

2069.7 --> 2074.74
to try to discourage them in order to

2072.76 --> 2077.139
make them look foolish

2074.74 --> 2078.399
or to nitpick on something they said

2077.139 --> 2081.339
wrong

2078.399 --> 2083.919
or something that's kind of socially out

2081.339 --> 2086.44
of order of the norm yeah it's oh you're

2083.919 --> 2089.74
such a [ __ ] little expert in that

2086.44 --> 2092.56
aren't you that's your life

2089.74 --> 2093.9399999999996
pecking order is your life your life is

2092.56 --> 2096.399
the pecking order

2093.94 --> 2098.32
that's your life that's what you are all

2096.399 --> 2101.3199999999997
Masters at you're a bunch of [ __ ]

2098.32 --> 2103.9
headless chickens

2101.32 --> 2107.619
and you're not actually smart

2103.9 --> 2110.2000000000003
I mean chickens and roosters towards

2107.619 --> 2112.599
other chickens and roosters yeah you can

2110.2 --> 2114.7
they can act freaking smart they can be

2112.599 --> 2117.0
like pork pork pork

2114.7 --> 2120.22
I'm the Park yeah

2117.0 --> 2122.74
yeah but they're actually [ __ ]

2120.22 --> 2124.0
they're just really good at the pecking

2122.74 --> 2126.8799999999997
order thing

2124.0 --> 2128.38
they're really good at having confidence

2126.88 --> 2130.6600000000003
but they're never going to really be

2128.38 --> 2133.06
tested on their intellectual skills or

2130.66 --> 2136.1189999999997
anything because nobody does that yeah

2133.06 --> 2137.92
that is what you do ballers

2136.119 --> 2139.599
that's your life

2137.92 --> 2141.0
it's all about the pecking order it's

2139.599 --> 2142.96
all about

2141.0 --> 2146.2
unraveling

2142.96 --> 2148.9
people's social hierarchy that's your

2146.2 --> 2151.7799999999997
Mastery you don't actually know anything

2148.9 --> 2154.48
about mechanical things the only way you

2151.78 --> 2157.599
attain that sort of knowledge is by copy

2154.48 --> 2160.06
pasting it from official sources and if

2157.599 --> 2163.2400000000002
those official sources from one day to

2160.06 --> 2167.0789999999997
the other would suddenly change most of

2163.24 --> 2169.5989999999997
you wouldn't even realize it and you

2167.079 --> 2173.5
just take over the new programming

2169.599 --> 2176.02
without even realizing it changed

2173.5 --> 2178.66
because it's not your focus you just

2176.02 --> 2181.66
copy paste that [ __ ] from approved

2178.66 --> 2185.02
sources at the meantime your specialized

2181.66 --> 2186.04
Focus always goes to the [ __ ] pecking

2185.02 --> 2188.32
order

2186.04 --> 2190.42
because that's what you do that's the

2188.32 --> 2192.579
only thing you really do it's about the

2190.42 --> 2194.38
social hierarchy how do you peer

2192.579 --> 2196.54
pressure people how do you keep them in

2194.38 --> 2199.1800000000003
line how do you shame them how do you

2196.54 --> 2201.82
get underneath their skin yeah that's

2199.18 --> 2203.9199999999996
what you do that's your specialty not

2201.82 --> 2206.8
mechanics you're all a bunch of

2203.92 --> 2208.599
mechanical retards just a bunch of copy

2206.8 --> 2210.1600000000003
paste robots you don't know what the

2208.599 --> 2212.7400000000002
[ __ ] you're doing

2210.16 --> 2215.5
you're just trusting you're just

2212.74 --> 2217.66
trusting on the system

2215.5 --> 2219.64
yeah if they change it right under your

2217.66 --> 2222.22
nose you wouldn't even notice and this

2219.64 --> 2224.56
is proven this is proven by your

2222.22 --> 2228.4599999999996
interactions on the flatter debate for

2224.56 --> 2231.339
example it's just one show it's proven

2228.46 --> 2234.7
it literally switched things around

2231.339 --> 2237.339
you don't even notice

2234.7 --> 2238.8999999999996
you don't even notice what the [ __ ]

2237.339 --> 2241.859
going on anymore

2238.9 --> 2244.48
because your focus was only

2241.859 --> 2246.339
how do I get underneath there how do I

2244.48 --> 2248.14
reattane dominance how do I get this

2246.339 --> 2250.06
undercutter because you don't think

2248.14 --> 2253.2999999999997
about the mechanics you're just a bunch

2250.06 --> 2256.599
of copy based drones

2253.3 --> 2259.599
you don't really understand that [ __ ]

2256.599 --> 2261.2200000000003
it's just social hierarchy pecking order

2259.599 --> 2263.4
that's what you're about that's what you

2261.22 --> 2263.3999999999996
do

2266.859 --> 2271.96
see see how triggered they are yeah and

2270.099 --> 2274.9
this is here's the thing

2271.96 --> 2276.78
discuss point about physics yeah you

2274.9 --> 2280.42
know what that actually entails

2276.78 --> 2284.2000000000003
endlessly grinding and whining and be

2280.42 --> 2287.14
like yeah I know [ __ ] 10 teachers

2284.2 --> 2291.8999999999996
they were all super dominant in their

2287.14 --> 2291.9
explanation Irwin you got it all wrong

2295.06 --> 2300.4
that's what you do yeah because it's not

2298.48 --> 2303.76
about the [ __ ] mechanics it's about

2300.4 --> 2305.079
we need to pecking order the [ __ ] out of

2303.76 --> 2307.8390000000004
this guy

2305.079 --> 2310.119
because he's exposing a very sensitive

2307.839 --> 2312.88
little [ __ ] detail about our

2310.119 --> 2315.099
Collective cult

2312.88 --> 2317.46
that's what's going on I know how that

2315.099 --> 2317.46
works

2322.72 --> 2325.6189999999997
uh

2328.839 --> 2331.14
foreign

2332.099 --> 2336.88
now he needs to get banned he knows it's

2334.9 --> 2338.44
out of control we've been completely

2336.88 --> 2341.98
exposed

2338.44 --> 2345.52
no more Shield is just disgrace so now

2341.98 --> 2350.14
he's going to implant suggestions

2345.52 --> 2352.48
to be banned so after he's banned he can

2350.14 --> 2355.5989999999997
make a blah blah blah blah blah blah

2352.48 --> 2357.339
blah excuse ran for himself as to how he

2355.599 --> 2359.7400000000002
got banned and so he can forget all

2357.339 --> 2361.119
about it and forget this humiliating

2359.74 --> 2365.7599999999998
moment

2361.119 --> 2365.76
hey Adam L I know how you work

2371.2 --> 2376.839
yeah laugh for me maniacally go ahead

2374.26 --> 2379.599
you can reattane dominance after all

2376.839 --> 2382.7999999999997
this I know you're you're you could get

2379.599 --> 2382.8
on top of this right

2383.8 --> 2389.3390000000004
dingleberry man dingleberry man hey hey

2389.5 --> 2394.96
Elijah what do you think of my diagram

2391.98 --> 2396.46
this is the this is what happens in

2394.96 --> 2398.92
Ballers Minds

2396.46 --> 2401.46
this is a symbol of their internal

2398.92 --> 2401.46
workings

2403.78 --> 2410.099
this is what they have in their head

2407.26 --> 2410.099
what do you think

2433.24 --> 2439.68
good to see you here by the way

2436.48 --> 2439.68
give you a wrench

2440.68 --> 2446.52
I mean Flat Earth debate members just

2442.72 --> 2446.52
they're gonna get wrenches of course

2461.2 --> 2466.54
what's the straight up line that's the

2463.599 --> 2469.599
person standing on the flat plane

2466.54 --> 2471.96
Imagining the sphere underneath it akumo

2469.599 --> 2471.96
virus

2481.96 --> 2484.56
it

2485.44 --> 2493.14
this is someone's really triggered

2489.579 --> 2493.1400000000003
oh Adam l

2499.78 --> 2504.6600000000003
16 subscriber man adamel

2530.98 --> 2537.16
yes yes quickly re-establish dominance

2534.28 --> 2538.5400000000004
you can get on top of this after all

2537.16 --> 2541.72
that

2538.54 --> 2544.24
you know if just enough time passes

2541.72 --> 2547.1189999999997
then it can all sync and you can just

2544.24 --> 2549.819
imagine how you won that situation right

2547.119 --> 2552.28
because that's your specialty

2549.819 --> 2554.68
yeah that's your pecking order specialty

2552.28 --> 2556.78
that's what you do

2554.68 --> 2558.52
yeah and it works among the other

2556.78 --> 2561.0400000000004
chickens it works among the other

2558.52 --> 2562.359
Ballers because nobody actually calls

2561.04 --> 2564.94
you on anything

2562.359 --> 2567.339
so it's just who's the best at

2564.94 --> 2569.079
pretending they are dominant and on top

2567.339 --> 2570.94
of the situation intellectually because

2569.079 --> 2573.76
nobody's gonna test you intellectually

2570.94 --> 2575.44
and when we do it you just twist your

2573.76 --> 2577.3590000000004
way around with your double think and

2575.44 --> 2580.54
triple think and quadruple thinking

2577.359 --> 2582.04
right the Ballers don't mind if you do

2580.54 --> 2584.5
that because you're facing a flat

2582.04 --> 2586.7799999999997
earther of course direct straight to

2584.5 --> 2589.96
your face lies

2586.78 --> 2591.4
direct lies is permitted because you're

2589.96 --> 2593.44
talking to a flat Earth and then you can

2591.4 --> 2595.1800000000003
do whatever the [ __ ] you want and

2593.44 --> 2596.079
they'll still welcome you back after

2595.18 --> 2598.24
that

2596.079 --> 2601.1800000000003
right even though everything you said

2598.24 --> 2603.9399999999996
was completely ludicrous and wrong and

2601.18 --> 2606.0989999999997
lies doesn't matter because pecking

2603.94 --> 2608.8
order it's okay right it's not about the

2606.099 --> 2612.2200000000003
argument it's not about whether you're

2608.8 --> 2614.98
correct or wrong it's about the effort

2612.22 --> 2618.52
right it's about the effort you made an

2614.98 --> 2620.7400000000002
effort you tried to stay on top of it

2618.52 --> 2623.2
not through arguments but just by

2620.74 --> 2626.4399999999996
elbowing and being a complete [ __ ]

2623.2 --> 2629.6189999999997
and ignoring things because that's your

2626.44 --> 2631.54
tactics that's what your specialty is as

2629.619 --> 2633.88
a ball zealot

2631.54 --> 2636.64
that's what you do that's what you focus

2633.88 --> 2638.02
on all day like chickens focus on the

2636.64 --> 2640.42
pecking order

2638.02 --> 2642.339
that's what you do I know it is it's not

2640.42 --> 2645.04
the mechanics because the mechanics is

2642.339 --> 2647.14
just oh just the body aside just copy

2645.04 --> 2648.819
paste it just Google it quickly right oh

2647.14 --> 2650.3799999999997
they could have changed it right there

2648.819 --> 2652.599
and you wouldn't even notice it because

2650.38 --> 2655.78
it doesn't matter because the consensus

2652.599 --> 2657.88
tells you what it is right so you don't

2655.78 --> 2660.6400000000003
have to actually understand the

2657.88 --> 2663.46
mechanics you just have to copy paste it

2660.64 --> 2666.7599999999998
in your head and repeat it and then you

2663.46 --> 2669.46
win right not by understanding but by

2666.76 --> 2671.5600000000004
getting it right and then you can blow

2669.46 --> 2674.68
yourself up like a balloon again oh I'm

2671.56 --> 2677.5
so I'm so inflated I'm so valuable I'm

2674.68 --> 2679.839
such an intellect so you can shame

2677.5 --> 2681.16
people like flat earthers with that

2679.839 --> 2683.319
attitude

2681.16 --> 2685.66
because they don't do that they don't go

2683.319 --> 2689.319
with the consensus

2685.66 --> 2691.66
right that's what you do I know that's

2689.319 --> 2695.8
what you do we've been sitting through

2691.66 --> 2699.8799999999997
that for six seven years

2695.8 --> 2701.5600000000004
it's all you do you don't focus on

2699.88 --> 2704.44
actually figuring things out

2701.56 --> 2706.24
mechanically that's what you never do

2704.44 --> 2710.079
only thing you try to figure out

2706.24 --> 2712.0
mechanically is how can we seemingly

2710.079 --> 2716.5600000000004
justify

2712.0 --> 2719.14
that the data doesn't match the model

2716.56 --> 2721.599
that's that's like what you really you

2719.14 --> 2724.839
don't make it fit you just have to seem

2721.599 --> 2727.3590000000004
to fake it's just a painting job

2724.839 --> 2729.46
pecking order social hierarchy and a

2727.359 --> 2731.619
bunch of nice painting right it's

2729.46 --> 2734.02
Artistry it doesn't have to actually fit

2731.619 --> 2736.6600000000003
as long as it just seems to fit in the

2734.02 --> 2740.5
moment it's okay I know

2736.66 --> 2742.0
I know because I do it too when I play

2740.5 --> 2745.0
Ballwin

2742.0 --> 2746.8
I love that game but it's a game it's a

2745.0 --> 2748.599
it's like painting it's like action

2746.8 --> 2752.079
painting in the moment

2748.599 --> 2755.26
with math and visualization I love it

2752.079 --> 2758.02
but I don't think that I'm actually

2755.26 --> 2763.1800000000003
really smart for doing that

2758.02 --> 2764.92
like that it helps me really know how to

2763.18 --> 2767.44
figure out things that are unknown

2764.92 --> 2768.52
necessary I don't think that necessarily

2767.44 --> 2770.56
it's

2768.52 --> 2773.079
it's like a hobby

2770.56 --> 2776.14
I just do that on the side

2773.079 --> 2778.1800000000003
it entertains me and it helps me figure

2776.14 --> 2780.5789999999997
out more about psychology

2778.18 --> 2783.8999999999996
so I figured out that Ballers just

2780.579 --> 2783.9
follow the pecking order

2783.94 --> 2789.04
and social peer pressure mechanisms and

2786.88 --> 2790.96
all that that that's their focus they

2789.04 --> 2792.7
don't focus on the mechanics they don't

2790.96 --> 2795.819
have to get it right

2792.7 --> 2800.0789999999997
they just have to seem to get it right

2795.819 --> 2802.3
have to say something agreeable to their

2800.079 --> 2804.2200000000003
peers

2802.3 --> 2806.02
right but their peers are very easy

2804.22 --> 2808.4199999999996
because they're all about the pecking

2806.02 --> 2810.819
order too so they don't you could say

2808.42 --> 2815.339
something really wrong and it'll just

2810.819 --> 2818.2
slip them by right unless it sounded

2815.339 --> 2819.94
sounded not actually mechanically

2818.2 --> 2821.319
figured out but sounded kind of like

2819.94 --> 2823.119
what flat earthers might have been

2821.319 --> 2825.359
saying for a while and then there might

2823.119 --> 2825.359
be like

2826.2 --> 2830.2
talking like a flat earther Talking Like

2829.06 --> 2832.18
A Flat Earth

2830.2 --> 2833.4399999999996
you can do that

2832.18 --> 2835.66
right

2833.44 --> 2837.76
that might happen that's the worst that

2835.66 --> 2839.6189999999997
could happen

2837.76 --> 2843.099
right because it's not about the

2839.619 --> 2844.9
mechanics it's just about whether

2843.099 --> 2846.819
you're sounding like a flat earther

2844.9 --> 2848.8
which makes too much mechanical sense

2846.819 --> 2851.319
you might accidentally accidentally

2848.8 --> 2854.38
catch on to reality how things really

2851.319 --> 2857.2
work and then you can't

2854.38 --> 2859.48
imagine that dingleberry Earth

2857.2 --> 2862.4199999999996
underneath the flat plane you're

2859.48 --> 2864.819
standing on anymore as easily

2862.42 --> 2866.98
so you got to avoid the lingo it's

2864.819 --> 2870.66
almost useful to have flat earthers

2866.98 --> 2873.579
around so you can more easily identify

2870.66 --> 2875.0789999999997
what train of thinking you should be

2873.579 --> 2878.98
avoiding

2875.079 --> 2880.78
in order to prevent the dispelling of

2878.98 --> 2882.52
the dingleberry Earth you imagine

2880.78 --> 2885.059
underneath the flat plane you're

2882.52 --> 2885.059
standing on

2888.94 --> 2891.94
this

2892.54 --> 2898.9
this thing yeah because in your mind you

2895.599 --> 2902.099
try to just erase that flat plane

2898.9 --> 2906.2200000000003
but in reality when you use your eyes

2902.099 --> 2907.7200000000003
you see that flat plane everything is on

2906.22 --> 2911.0789999999997
that flat plane

2907.72 --> 2913.7799999999997
and that ball remains to Be Imagined

2911.079 --> 2916.54
underneath there if you catch on to that

2913.78 --> 2919.96
too well too quickly

2916.54 --> 2922.66
then the whole spell just snaps and then

2919.96 --> 2924.64
you have to face all these disgusted do

2922.66 --> 2927.22
you have to face the rooster house all

2924.64 --> 2929.5589999999997
of a sudden yeah you were a chicken all

2927.22 --> 2933.2799999999997
that time oh you're gonna fall out of

2929.559 --> 2936.7000000000003
line in the pecking order now yes you're

2933.28 --> 2940.3590000000004
freaking social life depends on your own

2936.7 --> 2943.2999999999997
idiocy in order to retain your religion

2940.359 --> 2946.2999999999997
if you fall out a line in the pecking

2943.3 --> 2947.6800000000003
order and suddenly realize that this is

2946.3 --> 2951.3390000000004
not real

2947.68 --> 2953.68
at this ball here is Imagine

2951.339 --> 2955.359
yeah now now you're gonna get it now

2953.68 --> 2958.72
certainly that

2955.359 --> 2962.859
the hen house they were gonna be like ah

2958.72 --> 2964.18
an outcast an unbeliever pack him to

2962.859 --> 2966.46
death

2964.18 --> 2968.5789999999997
and you don't want that you fear that so

2966.46 --> 2971.14
you'd rather make yourself

2968.579 --> 2974.98
mentally [ __ ] you'd rather

2971.14 --> 2978.22
spiritually lobotomize yourself

2974.98 --> 2980.619
and go into full-on demonic double speak

2978.22 --> 2982.74
quadruple speak

2980.619 --> 2987.46
yeah

2982.74 --> 2990.64
just to prevent yourself from realizing

2987.46 --> 2993.04
that what you believe is a dream and not

2990.64 --> 2996.5789999999997
based in physical reality

2993.04 --> 2998.92
yeah you'd rather spiritually lobotomize

2996.579 --> 3000.6600000000003
yourself than let it sink in that

2998.92 --> 3004.44
everything you stand for everything

3000.66 --> 3007.2
you've worked on is all wrong

3004.44 --> 3009.839
it's very painful

3007.2 --> 3010.8799999999997
I mean we as flat earthers laugh about

3009.839 --> 3013.38
that

3010.88 --> 3015.78
sometimes right when the double speaking

3013.38 --> 3018.7200000000003
squirting goes on

3015.78 --> 3021.3590000000004
the Flat Earth debate I laugh about it

3018.72 --> 3023.16
but in reality it's actually really

3021.359 --> 3025.5
tragic

3023.16 --> 3028.2
it's just that

3025.5 --> 3031.94
if it was only tragic for the Ballers

3028.2 --> 3036.5989999999997
then I'd be a bit sad but the thing is

3031.94 --> 3039.9
it's also a massive nuisance and burden

3036.599 --> 3042.96
and basically a psychological attack on

3039.9 --> 3046.5
those that don't do it the flat earthers

3042.96 --> 3049.68
so that kind of evens it out and turns

3046.5 --> 3052.14
it from sad into sadistically [ __ ]

3049.68 --> 3052.7999999999997
hilarious because we think you deserve

3052.14 --> 3055.68
it

3052.8 --> 3059.819
because you make our lives miserable on

3055.68 --> 3062.339
purpose and you pride yourself for that

3059.819 --> 3066.48
devious demonic deed

3062.339 --> 3070.619
constantly you publicly brag about your

3066.48 --> 3074.46
misbehavior towards other people

3070.619 --> 3076.079
yeah you think that's good so yeah if we

3074.46 --> 3078.42
then catch you

3076.079 --> 3080.4
corner you in an argument and you start

3078.42 --> 3085.079
double speaking like a freaking idiot

3080.4 --> 3088.8
like a lunatic then we damn well deserve

3085.079 --> 3091.559
to have a really good laugh about that

3088.8 --> 3094.619
yeah to even out some of the frustration

3091.559 --> 3097.8590000000004
and the pain we had to endure sitting

3094.619 --> 3101.94
through your you bunch of maniacs

3097.859 --> 3104.0
you bunch of pecking order demons

3101.94 --> 3106.68
the way you act

3104.0 --> 3110.24
constantly at harming discouraging

3106.68 --> 3114.359
bringing in disgusting things

3110.24 --> 3117.54
downplaying deceiving lying everything

3114.359 --> 3121.319
yeah we will have a damn good laugh

3117.54 --> 3123.9
when we corner you and Nathan rubs his

3121.319 --> 3125.94
freaking balls on your face we will have

3123.9 --> 3127.859
a good laugh about that even though it's

3125.94 --> 3130.92
actually tragic what's happening to you

3127.859 --> 3133.7999999999997
but because you haven't just kept that

3130.92 --> 3137.339
tragedy to yourself like a man with

3133.8 --> 3138.9
honor yeah when you're in pain you keep

3137.339 --> 3141.359
that to yourself you take your

3138.9 --> 3144.54
responsibility you don't make that pain

3141.359 --> 3147.54
a burden to other people like a baby

3144.54 --> 3150.359
screaming all the time yeah that's what

3147.54 --> 3152.579
a decent human being doesn't do you keep

3150.359 --> 3154.38
it to yourself

3152.579 --> 3155.94
normally

3154.38 --> 3157.6800000000003
yeah unless you can do something

3155.94 --> 3160.26
constructive with it you don't do that

3157.68 --> 3163.3799999999997
and you think it's normal to misbehave

3160.26 --> 3166.26
and to act like a bunch of chickens with

3163.38 --> 3169.1400000000003
a pecking order towards other people

3166.26 --> 3171.5400000000004
like that the ACT demonically towards

3169.14 --> 3174.319
others you think that's normal

3171.54 --> 3174.319
it isn't

3177.3 --> 3181.6800000000003
are you going to according to me oh wow

3179.339 --> 3184.0789999999997
somebody's like really getting into what

3181.68 --> 3185.819
I'm saying yeah I was just talking about

3184.079 --> 3189.3590000000004
an example I wasn't talking about you

3185.819 --> 3190.92
personally Adam L I don't know you for

3189.359 --> 3194.04
that long I just know that everything

3190.92 --> 3197.66
you said so far pretty much put you on

3194.04 --> 3197.66
the scale around seven

3198.359 --> 3205.2
seven staircases down into hell

3202.14 --> 3208.2
so I can definitely identify where you

3205.2 --> 3209.8799999999997
are at emotionally and mentally but I

3208.2 --> 3211.5589999999997
haven't really witnessed any of your

3209.88 --> 3213.42
actions other than what you've said in

3211.559 --> 3215.88
this chat so far and have been able to

3213.42 --> 3220.38
cross-reference it with the in my mind

3215.88 --> 3221.6400000000003
intuitively with like another thousand

3220.38 --> 3224.359
people

3221.64 --> 3224.359
like you

3231.059 --> 3235.92
sounds like Brenda

3233.46 --> 3239.94
yeah could be

3235.92 --> 3241.619
although Brenda's is usually worse

3239.94 --> 3243.9
the funny thing about Brenda is that

3241.619 --> 3246.96
when she gets really frustrated she

3243.9 --> 3248.04
starts to become noticeably measurably

3246.96 --> 3250.98
Dumber

3248.04 --> 3253.619
it like numbs her down and it's like

3250.98 --> 3256.5
if when Brenda gets frustrated she like

3253.619 --> 3259.26
loses 20 IQ points

3256.5 --> 3262.619
it's like it literally slows her down

3259.26 --> 3265.8590000000004
into a [ __ ] it's very weird but it's a

3262.619 --> 3269.099
very distinct trait with her

3265.859 --> 3271.2
so if it's Brenda you would know because

3269.099 --> 3272.7000000000003
then the frustration would lead to

3271.2 --> 3275.3999999999996
increasingly

3272.7 --> 3278.8799999999997
more [ __ ] type responses and not

3275.4 --> 3281.099
like dumb but just slowed down

3278.88 --> 3283.2000000000003
it's really weird Brenda has a really

3281.099 --> 3286.7400000000002
weird

3283.2 --> 3289.799
yeah and nasty but it it really slows

3286.74 --> 3292.2799999999997
her down she becomes really slow

3289.799 --> 3292.28
weird

3301.38 --> 3307.079
you believe in Flat Earth yeah you

3304.14 --> 3309.299
believe in a dingleberry on the Flat

3307.079 --> 3311.4
Earth you're standing on Adam L this is

3309.299 --> 3316.079
what happens in your mind

3311.4 --> 3318.6600000000003
your life is what your life is like

3316.079 --> 3320.819
that's you yeah you're standing on the

3318.66 --> 3323.04
flat plane everything is measured flat

3320.819 --> 3326.2799999999997
Black Swan

3323.04 --> 3328.14
but you imagine

3326.28 --> 3329.76
that there's this ball underneath that

3328.14 --> 3331.74
the flat plane you're standing on

3329.76 --> 3333.78
actually adds up to a ball you've

3331.74 --> 3335.3999999999996
literally said it in the chat it's just

3333.78 --> 3338.88
really big

3335.4 --> 3341.64
it's just so big oh gent for me

3338.88 --> 3344.7000000000003
chant for me with your ad homs

3341.64 --> 3346.98
share your pain at ml

3344.7 --> 3349.02
yeah I'm not I'm not even being circuit

3346.98 --> 3352.64
I'm actually enjoying this in this

3349.02 --> 3352.64
moment it's so funny

3367.02 --> 3370.16
and it's okay man

3370.26 --> 3376.3190000000004
I used to be a dingleberry Arthur

3372.96 --> 3378.7200000000003
and I mean quite literally I think I

3376.319 --> 3380.7599999999998
even explained I even explained that

3378.72 --> 3383.5789999999997
once

3380.76 --> 3386.46
I think was it around when I was 12.

3383.579 --> 3390.059
I had a weird moment where basically

3386.46 --> 3393.0
Jesuit teachers were literally telling

3390.059 --> 3394.98
me I was and I was open to it I was like

3393.0 --> 3396.72
program me please I want to do this

3394.98 --> 3398.64
right

3396.72 --> 3401.22
I want to be a special boy I want to do

3398.64 --> 3403.3799999999997
it right and the actual teachers real

3401.22 --> 3405.1189999999997
people

3403.38 --> 3408.839
yeah

3405.119 --> 3411.839
and I had weird Vision entanglements

3408.839 --> 3414.9
with them where in which they explained

3411.839 --> 3417.0
to me exactly this that's how you do it

3414.9 --> 3420.54
like but it seemed so flat that's

3417.0 --> 3422.54
because of refraction and light effects

3420.54 --> 3425.819
and it's actually

3422.54 --> 3429.96
wrapped around a ball

3425.819 --> 3432.599
it just seems flat yeah

3429.96 --> 3435.059
that happened in my Visions like when I

3432.599 --> 3437.6400000000003
was 12 with these teachers they'd never

3435.059 --> 3441.1800000000003
literally told that to my face I just

3437.64 --> 3443.04
had like this weird holographic dream

3441.18 --> 3445.5589999999997
with them in it

3443.04 --> 3447.18
and they told me that like that's how it

3445.559 --> 3450.0
works

3447.18 --> 3451.14
you just wrap it around a ball in your

3450.0 --> 3453.5
mind

3451.14 --> 3456.42
yeah

3453.5 --> 3458.52
dingleberry Earth because it is actually

3456.42 --> 3459.66
flat

3458.52 --> 3462.599
but

3459.66 --> 3465.299
you just have to visualize how over

3462.599 --> 3468.299
distance that eventually turns into a

3465.299 --> 3469.68
sphere don't think about the scaling

3468.299 --> 3472.2
issues

3469.68 --> 3475.46
don't think about the Horizon as an edge

3472.2 --> 3475.46
just imagine

3475.74 --> 3483.1189999999997
right open a second window in your mind

3479.28 --> 3486.059
and start Imagining the ball Earth

3483.119 --> 3489.78
underneath where you're standing

3486.059 --> 3491.8190000000004
dingleberry Earth that process

3489.78 --> 3495.299
that happened in my Visions when I was

3491.819 --> 3497.46
12. they basically showed me this and I

3495.299 --> 3501.14
absolutely bought it I was like yes sir

3497.46 --> 3501.14
I want to do the right thing sir

3503.16 --> 3510.74
this is part of how I became baller

3505.98 --> 3510.7400000000002
I was very easily programmable back then

3512.099 --> 3515.819
because I was like yeah it's my duty to

3514.74 --> 3517.4399999999996
my country

3515.819 --> 3519.54
really

3517.44 --> 3521.4
even though I was very much against the

3519.54 --> 3523.68
military it's just that a thing it's

3521.4 --> 3526.319
just an honor it's just I thought I was

3523.68 --> 3528.54
supposed to do that

3526.319 --> 3529.859
and then later I started to figure out

3528.54 --> 3533.52
that all these people that actually

3529.859 --> 3536.16
delve into heliocentrism there are a

3533.52 --> 3539.4
whole bunch of egotistical maniacal

3536.16 --> 3540.839
deviants and creeps that really hate

3539.4 --> 3542.76
Humanity

3540.839 --> 3544.98
that's what I figured out about those

3542.76 --> 3545.94
people and that's why I kind of turned

3544.98 --> 3548.46
away

3545.94 --> 3550.68
what I was going to be

3548.46 --> 3552.2400000000002
I kind of wanted to be like an

3550.68 --> 3554.64
astrophysicist

3552.24 --> 3556.799
before I knew that it was all complete

3554.64 --> 3558.18
[ __ ] because I actually wanted to do

3556.799 --> 3560.4
real things

3558.18 --> 3563.5789999999997
like I wanted to be in an astronaut suit

3560.4 --> 3565.559
and go to the space station and just

3563.579 --> 3568.5
do experiments like do physics

3565.559 --> 3570.119
experiments that that's lit I've thought

3568.5 --> 3574.339
that

3570.119 --> 3574.339
I thought that pretty much up to

3576.38 --> 3581.94
17. when the really really big Vision

3580.02 --> 3585.319
happened and after that it was just

3581.94 --> 3585.319
really confused for a long time

3586.44 --> 3590.16
like I kind of put it to the back

3588.0 --> 3592.38
because like help that's total chaos is

3590.16 --> 3594.7799999999997
dangerous I just need to think about

3592.38 --> 3596.339
something else

3594.78 --> 3600.3190000000004
and

3596.339 --> 3600.319
but I still believe that for a while

3601.14 --> 3606.54
I just figured out like NASA like after

3603.66 --> 3608.94
I was 70 I I basically despite

3606.54 --> 3612.9
everything I've been confronted with and

3608.94 --> 3616.319
rejected I still realized like NASA

3612.9 --> 3618.48
is just wrong they're bad

3616.319 --> 3620.4
like even from a heliocentric

3618.48 --> 3622.2
perspective like they are literally

3620.4 --> 3625.7400000000002
[ __ ] with us

3622.2 --> 3628.2
and at the time I thought they're

3625.74 --> 3631.0789999999997
actually a cover agency

3628.2 --> 3634.5589999999997
they're they're like whole they're

3631.079 --> 3637.8590000000004
trying to make us believe it's all fake

3634.559 --> 3639.78
because they're hiding it from us it's

3637.859 --> 3641.7
actually out there but it's super secret

3639.78 --> 3644.099
it's probably different from what

3641.7 --> 3645.14
they're telling and they're just trying

3644.099 --> 3648.2400000000002
to

3645.14 --> 3650.4
discourage us from going there

3648.24 --> 3652.2
right from doing these things from

3650.4 --> 3654.299
actually exploring space they're doing

3652.2 --> 3655.9199999999996
it on purpose they're showing us these

3654.299 --> 3657.48
lies and these stupid trickery and

3655.92 --> 3660.299
stagecraft

3657.48 --> 3661.44
to discourage us that's what I thought

3660.299 --> 3663.54
back then

3661.44 --> 3668.64
and I kind of held on to that for a

3663.54 --> 3668.64
while even up till like 2011.

3670.02 --> 3676.2
no wait

3671.7 --> 3677.72
yeah no 2010 then I sort of discovered

3676.2 --> 3679.5589999999997
about Flat Earth so it's still

3677.72 --> 3681.5989999999997
compartmentalized it

3679.559 --> 3683.28
then I forgot about it again when

3681.599 --> 3686.04
suddenly everybody bailed on me

3683.28 --> 3689.2200000000003
including my freaking EX

3686.04 --> 3691.44
but including the guy that I basically

3689.22 --> 3693.24
partnered up with as a flat earther in

3691.44 --> 3694.92
secret because we didn't do that on

3693.24 --> 3696.839
YouTube or anything we're not public it

3694.92 --> 3699.839
was really nervous about that and he got

3696.839 --> 3703.68
threatened I was there I visually saw a

3699.839 --> 3706.02
man threaten him over it man covered in

3703.68 --> 3707.64
medals and [ __ ] with some Freemason old

3706.02 --> 3710.16
guy I think

3707.64 --> 3712.5
right and that was really creepy after

3710.16 --> 3714.1189999999997
that I kind of like forgot all about it

3712.5 --> 3716.46
because I was completely alone again and

3714.119 --> 3718.92
that was again like okay let's continue

3716.46 --> 3721.02
this project how do we get to actually

3718.92 --> 3723.48
build a space station

3721.02 --> 3726.2599999999998
that's not fake and some in some pool

3723.48 --> 3729.299
how do we get a real space station

3726.26 --> 3735.0
that's what I continued with and that's

3729.299 --> 3737.88
like a 2000 11 2012. isn't that crazy

3735.0 --> 3740.7
when I had just learned about Flat Earth

3737.88 --> 3743.1600000000003
and mechanics and the Foolery

3740.7 --> 3745.6189999999997
and then suddenly I forgot about the

3743.16 --> 3747.7799999999997
entire flat part and was again like we

3745.619 --> 3750.539
need to explore space again

3747.78 --> 3753.1800000000003
it's so weird

3750.539 --> 3756.539
how basically tragedy can make you

3753.18 --> 3760.6189999999997
forget a whole bunch of things

3756.539 --> 3763.3190000000004
and actually forget I really forgot

3760.619 --> 3766.2000000000003
I mean I knew oh there's these friends

3763.319 --> 3769.319
we deal with physics and things

3766.2 --> 3771.839
but all the Flat Earth the actual

3769.319 --> 3773.94
Insight all of that had been like

3771.839 --> 3776.7599999999998
blotted out it was just I didn't

3773.94 --> 3778.799
remember it about that

3776.76 --> 3781.079
so weird

3778.799 --> 3783.299
I remember it all now

3781.079 --> 3786.42
but on the short run it was kind of just

3783.299 --> 3788.5389999999998
like blotted out

3786.42 --> 3790.859
even though I did remember like yeah

3788.539 --> 3792.96
friends with this all these things we

3790.859 --> 3798.14
talked about all these things but the

3792.96 --> 3798.14
Flat Earth details had been blotted out

3798.42 --> 3803.4
and I really like didn't remember that

3800.64 --> 3805.5589999999997
it's like it was just cut out of the

3803.4 --> 3807.0
movie temporarily

3805.559 --> 3809.599
weird

3807.0 --> 3809.599
anyway

3812.4 --> 3818.52
my digital camera was made us oh come on

3815.52 --> 3818.52
uh

3823.319 --> 3827.66
I'm really triggering some Ballers today

3839.52 --> 3845.359
God this is gonna be one intense flatter

3842.039 --> 3845.3590000000004
debate today isn't it

3846.359 --> 3851.66
they're already so riled up in arwin's

3849.299 --> 3851.66
chat

3854.46 --> 3860.16
oh sweet excuse me dude I wasn't even

3857.339 --> 3862.44
looking at chat I've been talking about

3860.16 --> 3864.42
my personal life for like five minutes

3862.44 --> 3867.299
or longer so

3864.42 --> 3869.46
don't skip you it's just that nobody

3867.299 --> 3872.0389999999998
gives a [ __ ]

3869.46 --> 3875.579
you're just being triggered

3872.039 --> 3877.6800000000003
ass in my chat whining for attention

3875.579 --> 3879.6600000000003
like a crying baby

3877.68 --> 3881.52
you're not actually saying anything

3879.66 --> 3884.7599999999998
interesting you're just whining for

3881.52 --> 3885.78
attention hoping to break Daddy's

3884.76 --> 3887.5200000000004
attention

3885.78 --> 3890.52
yeah

3887.52 --> 3891.96
oh just like a baby trying to break

3890.52 --> 3894.0
their parents attention that's what

3891.96 --> 3899.28
you're doing right now yeah

3894.0 --> 3899.28
yeah why did you pay attention yeah

3901.559 --> 3904.7000000000003
he's a whining baby

3907.319 --> 3910.38
how's the weather it's great here Sean

and check out the chicken

3920.7 --> 3923.8999999999996
there's this

3926.599 --> 3932.539
somebody's triggered he's he's calling

3930.059 --> 3932.539
refraction

3933.839 --> 3936.68
can you hear that

3944.7 --> 3950.819
oh now he's shutting up fine

3947.9 --> 3952.38
it's just I can never even hear it a

3950.819 --> 3953.94
chicken again without thinking

3952.38 --> 3956.78
refraction

3953.94 --> 3956.78
it's hilarious

3958.5 --> 3960.92
right

3964.02 --> 3968.18
you went FP I know baby

3971.28 --> 3974.7200000000003
yeah the weather is gorgeous

3981.359 --> 3984.74
I think I heard an owl by the way this

3983.76 --> 3990.1400000000003
night

3984.74 --> 3990.14
so the owls are still around that's fun

3996.599 --> 4000.039
hey Goldie macron

4027.5 --> 4031.46
hope I get out and enjoy oh definitely I

4029.96 --> 4034.099
already have I already went out for

4031.46 --> 4037.4
groceries before this

4034.099 --> 4039.44
and it is lovely weather like

4037.4 --> 4041.539
like yeah

4039.44 --> 4042.98
I mean in the evening it still gets a

4041.539 --> 4045.44
little cooler but

4042.98 --> 4047.059
in the day it's like lovely I don't I

4045.44 --> 4049.7200000000003
don't have to put on my sweater it's

4047.059 --> 4049.7200000000003
just lovely

4050.9 --> 4052.96
um

4063.64 --> 4070.16
okay I could move Iris I don't want to

4067.28 --> 4073.46
convert people don't worry you won't

4070.16 --> 4076.0589999999997
you're not converting anyone don't worry

4073.46 --> 4076.059
about that

4083.059 --> 4088.52
oh God he's projecting the [ __ ] out of

4085.64 --> 4091.2799999999997
this situation isn't he what a triggered

4088.52 --> 4093.559
little funny [ __ ] with

4091.28 --> 4097.46
The Man Without a point The Man Without

4093.559 --> 4099.02
like you don't even have an analogy

4097.46 --> 4101.4800000000005
it's just nothing

4099.02 --> 4104.120000000001
it's just projecting

4101.48 --> 4108.8189999999995
your sad

4104.12 --> 4108.8189999999995
pointless predicament on to me

4109.339 --> 4117.5
I mean can you even try to make at home

4113.359 --> 4119.900000000001
jokes not based on what I

4117.5 --> 4122.12
was talking about can you even make up

4119.9 --> 4125.3589999999995
your own at-home jokes

4122.12 --> 4127.5199999999995
it seems like you're just responding

4125.359 --> 4131.719
like a broken record

4127.52 --> 4135.080000000001
like a robot like oh he said something

4131.719 --> 4136.759
oh I have input now for routine for

4135.08 --> 4143.5599999999995
feedback

4136.759 --> 4143.56
uh uh yo you no you no you

4146.42 --> 4151.4800000000005
it's quite pathetic

4148.64 --> 4151.4800000000005
adamel

4165.98 --> 4170.369
foreign

4167.27 --> 4170.369000000001
[Music]

4171.08 --> 4175.54
dude are you on meth or something

4178.2 --> 4183.199
[Music]

4179.6 --> 4185.54
did you just take your pills adamel

4183.199 --> 4186.919999999999
I think you did you just took some pills

4185.54 --> 4190.7789999999995
didn't you I don't know what they were

4186.92 --> 4190.779
but I'm pretty sure that you did

4196.04 --> 4199.3
was it Ritalin

4211.88 --> 4215.719
yeah

4213.38 --> 4219.32
from what I learned about that

4215.719 --> 4221.9
is that like meth-based substances make

4219.32 --> 4224.84
you highly uncreative

4221.9 --> 4227.179
you become very productive but you don't

4224.84 --> 4228.7390000000005
you lose your creativity in the process

4227.179 --> 4230.719
so it's very typical that if somebody

4228.739 --> 4232.159
gets on meth that they're going to be

4230.719 --> 4234.9800000000005
very active

4232.159 --> 4237.62
but they're going to be projecting a lot

4234.98 --> 4239.0
and they will not be very creative and

4237.62 --> 4243.58
that seems the way that you're

4239.0 --> 4243.58
responding so far because every time

4243.86 --> 4249.62
I think up something new or something

4247.04 --> 4252.14
creative you latch on to that you're not

4249.62 --> 4254.659
actually saying anything that's creative

4252.14 --> 4257.179
in any sort of way so far

4254.659 --> 4259.42
nothing you've said Is Creative in any

4257.179 --> 4259.42
way

4261.199 --> 4265.219
so that makes me believe that you're

4263.179 --> 4267.1990000000005
probably on some kind of meth related

4265.219 --> 4270.8
drug at this point adamel and I don't

4267.199 --> 4274.28
blame you I mean if I was a white

4270.8 --> 4276.92
[ __ ] piece of trash like you I'd be

4274.28 --> 4279.5
addicted to math too

4276.92 --> 4281.9800000000005
huh adamel

4279.5 --> 4281.98
yeah

4302.719 --> 4304.9
foreign

4307.12 --> 4314.38
yeah by the way don't do that

4310.699 --> 4314.379999999999
math is terrible

4317.179 --> 4320.56
I've known good people

4321.5 --> 4325.42
that really struggle with it

4326.96 --> 4330.44
like just because they got used to

4329.12 --> 4332.48
wrestling not even because they were

4330.44 --> 4334.219
like oh a party drug but because of

4332.48 --> 4336.32
because they started with freaking

4334.219 --> 4339.679
rattling

4336.32 --> 4342.08
it's like once you like accept it into

4339.679 --> 4346.6
your system in your psychological part

4342.08 --> 4346.6
of your system you really got a problem

4349.82 --> 4354.86
I've always tried to find its way back

4351.98 --> 4356.959999999999
right because you you tend to when the

4354.86 --> 4360.08
people that take meth they always tend

4356.96 --> 4362.9
to like tie it into like activity

4360.08 --> 4365.54
moments of purpose and that's super

4362.9 --> 4367.5199999999995
problematic

4365.54 --> 4370.58
if you start to do that it's always

4367.52 --> 4373.52
gonna get back in your head in certain

4370.58 --> 4377.9
moments in your life it sucks so just

4373.52 --> 4379.76
never ever take it not a single time for

4377.9 --> 4380.9
any reason

4379.76 --> 4382.820000000001
like

4380.9 --> 4384.98
every time I hear for example about

4382.82 --> 4388.34
truckers and all that taking that [ __ ]

4384.98 --> 4392.0599999999995
then I'm like oh my god dude

4388.34 --> 4396.5
oh I mean I get it for professional

4392.06 --> 4399.159000000001
reasons or whatever yeah but [ __ ] dude

4396.5 --> 4399.159
like

4400.64 --> 4404.54
most people don't realize that it is

4403.28 --> 4407.239
pretty much

4404.54 --> 4409.659
in a different way but as bad as like

4407.239 --> 4414.199
heroin it's like it's going to

4409.659 --> 4417.259999999999
absolutely change your life

4414.199 --> 4422.0
and usually not in a good way

4417.26 --> 4426.14
now almost always not in a good way so

4422.0 --> 4427.719
no that's very funny animal no

4426.14 --> 4432.14
no I

4427.719 --> 4433.94
very purposely avoided yeah Ritalin and

4432.14 --> 4435.9800000000005
all that and I was kind of classified

4433.94 --> 4438.86
hyperactive yeah

4435.98 --> 4442.099999999999
I avoided that at all costs I didn't

4438.86 --> 4444.739
want it as a kid and my parents

4442.1 --> 4447.38
were against it too

4444.739 --> 4450.379999999999
even though it was a [ __ ] pain in the

4447.38 --> 4453.32
ass in certain days yeah you think that

4450.38 --> 4456.62
you're annoying as a troll dude

4453.32 --> 4460.099999999999
just be [ __ ] lucky you're you got all

4456.62 --> 4462.92
of you the world is freaking lucky

4460.1 --> 4465.9800000000005
that I kind of grew up from that because

4462.92 --> 4468.26
dude if I was a troll I would be so

4465.98 --> 4470.48
[ __ ]

4468.26 --> 4473.84
[ __ ] nasty

4470.48 --> 4476.419999999999
I'd like if I was at a really shitty

4473.84 --> 4478.82
piece of trolled trash like that

4476.42 --> 4480.56
I would freaking make a hobby out of

4478.82 --> 4483.5
getting people to kill themselves okay

4480.56 --> 4485.179
and I would [ __ ] succeed

4483.5 --> 4487.82
that's why I don't do that and I'm very

4485.179 --> 4490.46
glad I don't do that yeah you know

4487.82 --> 4494.179
sometimes it still slips out a little

4490.46 --> 4496.159
when [ __ ] scumbags out there just

4494.179 --> 4498.4400000000005
won't stop ever

4496.159 --> 4500.719
yeah then I do kind of like hey dude

4498.44 --> 4503.96
maybe it's just dive to kill yourself

4500.719 --> 4506.6
because you're absolute trash and nobody

4503.96 --> 4508.76
likes you like not even when you're not

4506.6 --> 4511.1
in a shitty mood people don't like you

4508.76 --> 4513.4400000000005
yeah

4511.1 --> 4515.54
it's not they don't like you because you

4513.44 --> 4518.659
are acting like trash in this moment no

4515.54 --> 4522.08
it's because even without that point in

4518.659 --> 4523.879999999999
time they still don't like you maybe you

4522.08 --> 4526.28
should just stop being a burden to

4523.88 --> 4528.4400000000005
everyone and everything in the world and

4526.28 --> 4531.0199999999995
just get the [ __ ] out

4528.44 --> 4535.759999999999
yeah I still get like that but that's

4531.02 --> 4538.219
not like a really troll bullying nasty

4535.76 --> 4540.320000000001
situation right it's on my own show I

4538.219 --> 4541.88
don't go to somebody else's show and do

4540.32 --> 4543.139999999999
that never

4541.88 --> 4545.6
never

4543.14 --> 4548.320000000001
I've never done that and you know it all

4545.6 --> 4548.320000000001
of you know that

4556.219 --> 4559.84
God one triggered ass

4559.88 --> 4564.679
yeah I'm done playing with that [ __ ]

4562.04 --> 4568.179
get the [ __ ] out scum

4564.679 --> 4568.179
what a piece of [ __ ]

4569.78 --> 4573.46
what a piece of [ __ ]

4575.54 --> 4580.5199999999995
yeah I know Goldie mckerman I'm very

4577.76 --> 4584.02
happy about that well my my parents were

4580.52 --> 4584.02
very naturalist like that

4584.659 --> 4590.48
with me at least unfortunately my mother

4587.48 --> 4593.178999999999
for herself did eventually get addicted

4590.48 --> 4596.799999999999
to Pharmaceuticals and that in my

4593.179 --> 4596.8
opinion that killed her

4599.719 --> 4605.659
but yeah I know I was I

4602.84 --> 4609.08
I only have bad experiences with

4605.659 --> 4611.659
Pharmaceuticals I really only do

4609.08 --> 4614.84
like every time I was like oh maybe I

4611.659 --> 4617.12
could try this it always didn't work it

4614.84 --> 4618.9800000000005
was always making things worse every

4617.12 --> 4621.8
[ __ ] time even with like little

4618.98 --> 4625.4
things like certain skin problems I had

4621.8 --> 4628.52
like oh try this and like yay that make

4625.4 --> 4631.699
it freaking worse thanks

4628.52 --> 4635.360000000001
it's painful it didn't work the

4631.699 --> 4638.799999999999
Situation's worse now thanks

4635.36 --> 4638.799999999999
so yeah it just

4639.26 --> 4646.219
just use plants psychology

4643.58 --> 4647.719
and take responsibility for your own

4646.219 --> 4650.96
health

4647.719 --> 4654.56
as in use your freaking mind

4650.96 --> 4657.32
and memory and figure it out figure out

4654.56 --> 4659.360000000001
what your rhythms are how you work

4657.32 --> 4663.38
what works

4659.36 --> 4665.48
and be consistent with it actually apply

4663.38 --> 4668.42
the knowledge that you gather over the

4665.48 --> 4671.739
time take the responsibility for that

4668.42 --> 4671.7390000000005
knowledge and use it

4671.9 --> 4675.44
yeah that's what I learned that those

4673.699 --> 4677.62
are the principles I grew up with for

4675.44 --> 4677.62
myself

4685.4 --> 4690.259999999999
so sorry to hear that

4687.26 --> 4692.12
yeah my mother

4690.26 --> 4694.820000000001
yeah I guess that not all of you know

4692.12 --> 4698.5599999999995
that yet right it's just I've told the

4694.82 --> 4698.5599999999995
story quite a few times by now

4700.64 --> 4704.360000000001
yeah 2005

4704.9 --> 4711.44
it's so long ago now

4708.08 --> 4714.04
I can't believe it's like 70 years later

4711.44 --> 4714.04
wow

4729.44 --> 4734.5
God it was Adam L triggered or what

4736.159 --> 4742.5199999999995
I can't believe I just let him do that

4738.679 --> 4745.88
for like an hour straight but it's like

4742.52 --> 4748.159000000001
it really wasn't getting to me

4745.88 --> 4752.08
I guess I like to brag with my troll

4748.159 --> 4752.08
tolerance sometimes when I have it

4790.4 --> 4795.199
yeah exactly gold macaron

4792.98 --> 4798.139999999999
but that's what the whole medical system

4795.199 --> 4802.099999999999
was basically erected for yeah by the

4798.14 --> 4804.7390000000005
freaking Rockefeller Foundation

4802.1 --> 4809.3
like the Red Cross and all that medical

4804.739 --> 4813.199
boards is a direct creation

4809.3 --> 4816.1990000000005
from the rubber Barons direct like they

4813.199 --> 4818.839999999999
literally created that nobody else was

4816.199 --> 4821.0599999999995
calling for that they conjured it they

4818.84 --> 4823.1
created it and it standardized it

4821.06 --> 4825.320000000001
immediately

4823.1 --> 4828.1990000000005
they literally forced it onto the public

4825.32 --> 4829.5199999999995
that was like yeah whatever we got our

4828.199 --> 4832.46
own stuff

4829.52 --> 4836.080000000001
but yeah over time that was lost because

4832.46 --> 4839.36
yeah if your children grow up

4836.08 --> 4841.219
they might be like oh my parents know

4839.36 --> 4843.86
all this stuff about herbs and that's

4841.219 --> 4846.26
cool right or they might be oh that

4843.86 --> 4849.259999999999
stupid old-fashioned we don't need that

4846.26 --> 4851.900000000001
we got modern science yeah

4849.26 --> 4855.92
because that's not just now

4851.9 --> 4859.58
that happens like with every generation

4855.92 --> 4861.86
and the more time passes the less there

4859.58 --> 4863.6
will be people left that are gonna side

4861.86 --> 4867.08
with the old knowledge and just do it

4863.6 --> 4869.0
right and the more whiny gamma [ __ ]

4867.08 --> 4872.239
that believe in

4869.0 --> 4873.86
science Medical Science and

4872.239 --> 4875.54
and just

4873.86 --> 4877.94
ignorant

4875.54 --> 4879.98
City people

4877.94 --> 4881.9
more of those remain

4879.98 --> 4884.299999999999
and that's the problem that's kind of

4881.9 --> 4887.679
why we're at like the next stage of that

4884.3 --> 4891.7390000000005
of modern city people is like insane

4887.679 --> 4894.26
Marxist sjw freaks

4891.739 --> 4897.08
vax zombies

4894.26 --> 4899.780000000001
yeah that's the next level down

4897.08 --> 4901.76
from that from that separation with the

4899.78 --> 4904.04
old knowledge

4901.76 --> 4905.659000000001
and yeah you can thank the Rockefeller

4904.04 --> 4909.08
foundation for that

4905.659 --> 4913.58
they basically conjured it up

4909.08 --> 4915.739
they yeah took away more pieces of the

4913.58 --> 4917.719
Traditions that were upheld by

4915.739 --> 4920.599999999999
Generations

4917.719 --> 4922.88
by presenting like medical socialism

4920.6 --> 4925.820000000001
it's like medical knowledge socialism

4922.88 --> 4929.2390000000005
like oh don't worry about all that

4925.82 --> 4930.739
complicated things we'll take care of

4929.239 --> 4934.339999999999
that yeah

4930.739 --> 4938.178999999999
and that's how we got where we are now

4934.34 --> 4941.12
that eventually like mutated into that

4938.179 --> 4943.6990000000005
super diabolical Eugenics plan which it

4941.12 --> 4947.12
was probably always conjured up for for

4943.699 --> 4948.5
eugenics which was in that time frame as

4947.12 --> 4951.38
well

4948.5 --> 4953.719
right Rockefeller Foundation probably

4951.38 --> 4955.0
created a Red Cross and the the medical

4953.719 --> 4960.38
boards

4955.0 --> 4963.739
specifically for eugenics purposes

4960.38 --> 4966.7390000000005
and that's how we got into the

4963.739 --> 4966.739
pandemic

4968.36 --> 4975.139
with a bunch of yeah

4971.239 --> 4978.04
jab euthanization and [ __ ]

4975.139 --> 4978.04
it's because of that

4980.9 --> 4986.78
never forget never forget that that's

4983.54 --> 4989.739
how it came into being

4986.78 --> 4992.199
there would have been no

4989.739 --> 4994.94
coronu whatever

4992.199 --> 4997.339999999999
virus propaganda blah blah blah that

4994.94 --> 5000.4
wouldn't be there if the Rockefeller

4997.34 --> 5002.7390000000005
Foundation hadn't created the medical

5000.4 --> 5005.379999999999
system the allopathic medical system if

5002.739 --> 5006.879999999999
we as we have it right now they hadn't

5005.38 --> 5009.3
done that we would have never come to

5006.88 --> 5009.3
this point

5009.76 --> 5015.639
because that's what he created it for

5011.94 --> 5018.36
medical tyranny it's like a

5015.639 --> 5022.54
priesthood it's medical priesthood

5018.36 --> 5023.799999999999
wizard group take control take mind

5022.54 --> 5026.139
control

5023.8 --> 5028.719
take control over the mind

5026.139 --> 5030.52
then you get authority over the body and

5028.719 --> 5032.56
you can do with it whatever the [ __ ] you

5030.52 --> 5034.780000000001
want you can kill it you can make it

5032.56 --> 5036.820000000001
better you can kill it you can make it

5034.78 --> 5039.159
better full control

5036.82 --> 5041.739
full control priesthood control over

5039.159 --> 5043.12
these people that don't know what's

5041.739 --> 5046.0599999999995
happening

5043.12 --> 5048.04
they just trust on you and if you are in

5046.06 --> 5051.04
a sadistic mood as some psycho doctor

5048.04 --> 5054.1
you can just designate them to get a

5051.04 --> 5057.0
procedure to die and you'll get legal

5054.1 --> 5057.0
cover for that

5058.36 --> 5065.82
because nobody outside of the system has

5062.139 --> 5065.82
authority over that sort of thing

5067.78 --> 5073.599999999999
right well

5070.54 --> 5076.6
in other situations before that was

5073.6 --> 5079.96
conjured people were dependent on just

5076.6 --> 5082.54
the local herbalist yeah and if the

5079.96 --> 5085.2390000000005
local herbalist was like in a crazy mood

5082.54 --> 5087.76
or like super dark or like bad

5085.239 --> 5090.159
relationship breakup and was thought

5087.76 --> 5092.02
like huh I'm gonna [ __ ] these people up

5090.159 --> 5094.719
yeah guess what would have happened yeah

5092.02 --> 5097.42
if you're as a herbalist if you if you

5094.719 --> 5100.12
poison somebody or whatever they would

5097.42 --> 5102.9400000000005
freaking kill you

5100.12 --> 5105.4
yeah he didn't have a legal backing if

5102.94 --> 5107.259999999999
you did it wrong you better do it right

5105.4 --> 5109.299999999999
or they get you

5107.26 --> 5112.42
and that's much more straightforward

5109.3 --> 5116.56
much more honest that forces

5112.42 --> 5119.04
the Physicians you could call it to do a

5116.56 --> 5119.04
good job

5120.639 --> 5125.02
to actually get results and to figure

5123.1 --> 5127.06
out what's going on because they were

5125.02 --> 5129.6990000000005
always like even herbalists are like

5127.06 --> 5131.4400000000005
doctors supposed to be

5129.699 --> 5133.0599999999995
what doctors are supposed to be they're

5131.44 --> 5134.138999999999
always trying to figure out what's going

5133.06 --> 5136.659000000001
on here

5134.139 --> 5138.6990000000005
what's the root of the problem how do I

5136.659 --> 5141.5199999999995
figure it out what tests do I do what

5138.699 --> 5143.739
can't I do right it's it's not that

5141.52 --> 5146.38
different it's just not based on faulty

5143.739 --> 5150.699
models which allopathic medical system

5146.38 --> 5154.06
is it's based on faulty models

5150.699 --> 5156.759999999999
bad assumptions short-term solutions

5154.06 --> 5158.02
that shouldn't be applied on the long

5156.76 --> 5160.5
run

5158.02 --> 5160.5
right

5161.56 --> 5164.1
anyway

5164.199 --> 5166.199
um

5168.46 --> 5172.4800000000005
has turned out to be a pretty good show

5170.26 --> 5175.12
today

5172.48 --> 5178.199
very happy with it

5175.12 --> 5178.199
feel much better too

5197.04 --> 5202.42
prosthetic Prosthetics

5200.679 --> 5204.82
no

5202.42 --> 5207.52
no Prosthetics

5204.82 --> 5209.94
that's different that's Prosthetics is

5207.52 --> 5209.9400000000005
separate

5210.1 --> 5215.76
yeah you don't need to be medical to

5212.98 --> 5215.759999999999
have prosthetics

5215.86 --> 5219.699
Prosthetics mostly is about is about

5218.02 --> 5222.639
knowing

5219.699 --> 5224.259999999999
autonomy as in like how your composure

5222.639 --> 5227.92
like you could be

5224.26 --> 5230.1990000000005
like a good Gym trainer would know how

5227.92 --> 5232.0
to help people with prosthetics yeah

5230.199 --> 5234.28
that has nothing to do with the

5232.0 --> 5235.06
allopathic medical system at all Sean

5234.28 --> 5239.159
Smith

5235.06 --> 5239.159000000001
and as for antibiotics

5239.44 --> 5242.32
yeah

5240.76 --> 5245.139
there's a lot of problem with

5242.32 --> 5246.28
antibiotics and there's better ways to

5245.139 --> 5248.9400000000005
do it

5246.28 --> 5248.94
actually

5249.1 --> 5253.2390000000005
right

5250.199 --> 5255.96
antibiotics is like rough

5253.239 --> 5259.0
a rough mechanism it's

5255.96 --> 5262.2390000000005
yeah and it's already yielding a lot of

5259.0 --> 5264.84
problems in modern time

5262.239 --> 5264.839999999999
so

5272.8 --> 5279.04
right it like antibiotics I like to

5275.26 --> 5280.3
compare that to artificial fertilizer

5279.04 --> 5283.78
right

5280.3 --> 5287.7390000000005
yeah it works it's quick it immediately

5283.78 --> 5290.46
gets resolved but then what right what's

5287.739 --> 5290.459999999999
the aftermath

5291.219 --> 5295.6
and that's a legitimate question to ask

5293.62 --> 5297.58
because hey with

5295.6 --> 5298.84
with artificial fertilizer yeah you're

5297.58 --> 5300.76
ramming out of the ground but guess

5298.84 --> 5302.679
what's gonna happen after that the

5300.76 --> 5306.280000000001
ground's kind of ruined

5302.679 --> 5308.8
yeah there's a backlash it the food's

5306.28 --> 5311.98
not healthy when you use artificial

5308.8 --> 5313.84
fertilizer it isn't this well-known fact

5311.98 --> 5315.638999999999
it's less healthy if you're dependent

5313.84 --> 5316.84
purely on that type of food you will

5315.639 --> 5318.54
become

5316.84 --> 5321.52
like

5318.54 --> 5324.5199999999995
drained off key nutrients

5321.52 --> 5327.34
that's historical fact it's historical

5324.52 --> 5329.320000000001
right well with antibiotics

5327.34 --> 5330.58
is a similar issue

5329.32 --> 5332.86
yeah

5330.58 --> 5336.4
oh yeah it might work really quickly and

5332.86 --> 5339.28
bang the infection is is like dealt with

5336.4 --> 5340.78
right well the problem with infection is

5339.28 --> 5342.759999999999
it's a model

5340.78 --> 5345.82
is that really the thing you need to be

5342.76 --> 5347.92
doing with it well if it's so bad that

5345.82 --> 5350.199
you could literally die

5347.92 --> 5352.719
because of a fever or something that's

5350.199 --> 5354.638999999999
extreme yeah I get it you want to

5352.719 --> 5356.7390000000005
prevent the direct death

5354.639 --> 5358.659000000001
right again that's the always the

5356.739 --> 5360.699
allopathic mindset it's like oh they're

5358.659 --> 5363.5199999999995
in the most critical situation yeah sure

5360.699 --> 5366.28
it'd probably work but there's always

5363.52 --> 5368.8
issues with antibiotics always

5366.28 --> 5371.739
not even talking about like antibiotic

5368.8 --> 5373.719
resistant infections

5371.739 --> 5376.48
I'm just talking about the influence it

5373.719 --> 5379.3
has on your intestines it always ruins

5376.48 --> 5381.178999999999
your gut floor and gut Flora is really

5379.3 --> 5385.5
important for your health

5381.179 --> 5385.5
on the long run right

5385.84 --> 5390.6990000000005
so

5387.88 --> 5393.219
is it really good

5390.699 --> 5395.259999999999
I mean is artificial fertilizer good is

5393.219 --> 5399.88
antibiotics good

5395.26 --> 5402.280000000001
I mean in extreme circumstances maybe

5399.88 --> 5406.0
right is it something you want to

5402.28 --> 5408.219
standardize absolutely not oh guess what

5406.0 --> 5410.44
happened that's exactly what they did

5408.219 --> 5412.4800000000005
they freaking standardized it they

5410.44 --> 5415.12
standardized antibiotics to the point

5412.48 --> 5419.199
where they literally

5415.12 --> 5421.599999999999
just half like cattle constantly get

5419.199 --> 5426.178999999999
pumped with this freaking antibiotics

5421.6 --> 5430.659000000001
for decades with disastrous consequences

5426.179 --> 5432.82
disastrous consequences for health yeah

5430.659 --> 5435.099999999999
and yeah with the artificial fertilizers

5432.82 --> 5438.4
already been admitted like in was it in

5435.1 --> 5440.38
World War II England resorted to

5438.4 --> 5442.659
artificial fertile fertilizer because

5440.38 --> 5444.58
they really like they were cut off and

5442.659 --> 5445.9
they needed that because they needed the

5444.58 --> 5449.98
food quick

5445.9 --> 5452.32
and it worked but then health problems

5449.98 --> 5453.699
pretty serious health problems came

5452.32 --> 5457.0
after

5453.699 --> 5459.54
it was really problematic right so think

5457.0 --> 5459.54
about that

5464.62 --> 5467.219
anyway

5467.32 --> 5472.54
so yeah allopathic medical system thanks

5470.26 --> 5475.179
Rockefeller Foundation

5472.54 --> 5478.239
wish you never did that and I mean it I

5475.179 --> 5481.84
wish they never did that

5478.239 --> 5484.48
if if that that moment was erased from

5481.84 --> 5486.219
history literally not historically out

5484.48 --> 5489.28
of the box but just literally never

5486.219 --> 5491.7390000000005
happened somehow think Mandela fantasy

5489.28 --> 5493.42
effect right that would have happened

5491.739 --> 5495.459999999999
it would have been very good for the

5493.42 --> 5498.34
world the world would now be a better

5495.46 --> 5501.46
place very likely

5498.34 --> 5503.5
and we wouldn't have had this crazy

5501.46 --> 5506.02
pandemic scam

5503.5 --> 5508.12
did I take no I didn't

5506.02 --> 5510.280000000001
kind of a stupid question is that of

5508.12 --> 5513.82
course I did not do that

5510.28 --> 5516.719
after all this you think I take it the

5513.82 --> 5516.719
hell is wrong with you

5541.44 --> 5548.4
oh God my chat is annoying uh you're all

5545.26 --> 5548.400000000001
just ignoring me

5549.04 --> 5556.48
tell the truth the truth is I have not

5552.159 --> 5560.94
taken a vaccine since I was seven

5556.48 --> 5560.94
and that's the absolute truth

5581.02 --> 5584.9800000000005
yeah Goldie but no it I don't know if

5583.42 --> 5586.659
the Rockefeller medical system can be

5584.98 --> 5590.138999999999
under yes

5586.659 --> 5592.54
but it can be undone afterward I was

5590.139 --> 5594.9400000000005
talking about what if it never came into

5592.54 --> 5597.04
being the world will very likely be a

5594.94 --> 5599.5
better place like there's a very little

5597.04 --> 5603.76
chance it wouldn't

5599.5 --> 5605.92
but like most branches of thinking and

5603.76 --> 5608.38
reasoning would make you conclude yeah

5605.92 --> 5610.4800000000005
the world would be a lot better

5608.38 --> 5613.12
if we really be better

5610.48 --> 5615.04
right it would not automatically mean

5613.12 --> 5618.04
that there wouldn't be any medical

5615.04 --> 5619.78
devices and like CAT scans and all that

5618.04 --> 5622.48
that wouldn't be invented because

5619.78 --> 5626.0199999999995
there's still a need for that

5622.48 --> 5630.459999999999
right that would still be useful to have

5626.02 --> 5633.1
it just wouldn't be all standardized

5630.46 --> 5635.639
and it wouldn't be yeah

5633.1 --> 5635.639
anyway

5637.42 --> 5644.02
but can it be on them well it can

5641.62 --> 5646.78
be taken out of its Authority position

5644.02 --> 5649.84
technically but it's really dependent on

5646.78 --> 5655.96
the people right if the if the people of

5649.84 --> 5660.58
the world like really really accept like

5655.96 --> 5664.2390000000005
yes we accept it was all a pipe dream

5660.58 --> 5666.4
and a lie they're actually out to kill

5664.239 --> 5671.44
us through our ignorance

5666.4 --> 5675.5199999999995
we must take medical responsibility for

5671.44 --> 5679.48
ourselves you must take it oh it's scary

5675.52 --> 5682.179
you must take medical responsibility for

5679.48 --> 5686.259999999999
yourself to understand your medical

5682.179 --> 5688.4800000000005
system or at least ensure that you have

5686.26 --> 5691.02
people in your family that are really

5688.48 --> 5695.32
good at it

5691.02 --> 5698.8
but even then you must

5695.32 --> 5701.799999999999
must take it responsibility you should

5698.8 --> 5706.96
never blindly trust anybody else with

5701.8 --> 5709.42
your health never never always be the

5706.96 --> 5712.6
last person responsible for your health

5709.42 --> 5714.88
and take it very serious

5712.6 --> 5716.679
and then there's all kinds of directions

5714.88 --> 5720.54
you can take

5716.679 --> 5720.54
it's quite a wondrous world really

5722.32 --> 5724.86
right

5732.94 --> 5739.96
only take no nobody should take it JFC

5736.98 --> 5740.86
it doesn't actually do anything good for

5739.96 --> 5744.159
you

5740.86 --> 5745.86
nobody ever should take

5744.159 --> 5751.839999999999
these

5745.86 --> 5755.139
mRNA supposed mnrna therapy shots nobody

5751.84 --> 5758.32
it's a Eugenics program there is no

5755.139 --> 5762.04
benefit for the person

5758.32 --> 5763.42
there is no benefit for the person

5762.04 --> 5765.0
taking it

5763.42 --> 5768.159
zero

5765.0 --> 5771.28
absolute zero not even a hundred

5768.159 --> 5778.119
billionth of a percent absolute zero

5771.28 --> 5778.119
Advantage zero Advantage zero advantage

5778.36 --> 5783.4
nobody should take it

5781.119 --> 5786.46
and the people that conjured this [ __ ]

5783.4 --> 5788.259999999999
up should all be arrested and their

5786.46 --> 5791.199
medical waste

5788.26 --> 5793.6
should be destroyed and made illegal

5791.199 --> 5795.58
from being fabricated

5793.6 --> 5799.719
yeah

5795.58 --> 5803.0199999999995
it's a hundred percent scam it's only

5799.719 --> 5805.96
damaging it's a Eugenics program it only

5803.02 --> 5810.400000000001
damages the people that take it and it

5805.96 --> 5812.38
is extremely toxic medical waste

5810.4 --> 5815.5599999999995
that is involved

5812.38 --> 5818.86
actually inject it into it's insane

5815.56 --> 5821.5
it should all be destroyed

5818.86 --> 5825.78
medical waste facilities that create

5821.5 --> 5825.78
that stuff should be destroyed

5828.82 --> 5830.94
okay

5831.82 --> 5834.42
anyway

5835.48 --> 5840.5199999999995
