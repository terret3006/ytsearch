you

55.71 --> 60.309
who

57.579 --> 63.339
morning welcome to flatter the earlybird

60.309 --> 65.17
number 571 i'm your host

63.339 --> 66.88
Arwen and before we start the show

65.17 --> 69.009
please don't forget to share it on any

66.88 --> 70.689
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

69.009 --> 72.25

patreon super chat and the membership

82.39 --> 89.229
system join button they'll be much

84.789 --> 92.14
appreciated and thanks for all the

89.229 --> 94.479
members that I do have and of course all

92.14 --> 106.11
the regular support and patreon support

94.479 --> 110.2
so the weather outside yeah it's hot

106.11 --> 113.649
it's kind of moist it's just very warm

110.2 --> 115.299
and well there's now a bit of a breeze

113.649 --> 118.319
here and there but it was almost like

115.299 --> 123.179
completely wind still the entire morning

118.319 --> 126.16
with the combination of the heat but

123.179 --> 130.66
that's nice now and yeah finally the Sun

126.16 --> 133.87
is off the side of my room so it's not

130.66 --> 138.129
so hot in here anymore but it's just a

133.87 --> 141.58
very warm overall oh yeah I do see some

138.129 --> 143.97
like chemtrail remnants have seen them

141.58 --> 149.62
actually being sprayed or in the air so

143.97 --> 152.98
yeah that is happening what's above here

149.62 --> 157.0
doesn't look like it was naturally

152.98 --> 160.14
either so yeah what anyway just like

157.0 --> 160.14
that's still nice day

163.68 --> 179.06900000000002
so only have green tea with me

168.43 --> 179.06900000000002
oh wait I also some blueberries three

182.13 --> 187.76999999999998
yeah with this kind of weather it's

184.11 --> 187.77
really good to have this

198.15 --> 207.48000000000002
anyway let's see who is in chat right

204.09 --> 213.739
hmm was first man the young uber moco

207.48 --> 215.94
good servant he have a Tom Parker

213.739 --> 221.239
Cerreta Cosentino hey Neal

215.94 --> 221.239
Zuri bear yeah good see you all

223.97 --> 233.269
Wednesday right yeah it's warm

236.95 --> 243.04999999999998
[Music]

239.17 --> 246.39999999999998
so I did yes

243.05 --> 246.4
yeah I didn't went to bed pretty early

254.36 --> 262.0
all right I just finished or finished

257.33 --> 262.0
there I kind of had to cut out in Mill

264.07 --> 272.99
watching a stream from from Roderigo

268.52 --> 275.81
Ferrari Nunez it was weird he was

272.99 --> 280.25
basically reviewing this Simon and thing

275.81 --> 284.15
that happened yeah and it was kind of

280.25 --> 287.18
interesting because yeah he does know

284.15 --> 292.64
how to explain a lot of detail what's

287.18 --> 299.81
going about group dynamics and yeah it

292.64 --> 303.71
was interesting though Buster's no not

299.81 --> 306.97
right no just his channel although he is

303.71 --> 306.96999999999997
on globe Buster's sometimes

317.31 --> 327.47
but yeah i don't know i didn't see it

320.7 --> 330.589
live right okay Lu my way

327.47 --> 330.58900000000006
[Music]

335.0 --> 349.669
michelson-morley what was it again to

345.9 --> 349.669
remember the name a lot

371.439 --> 387.42900000000003
oh right you had the light the light

378.279 --> 390.479
experiment all right Oh hmm well they

387.429 --> 398.919
probably don't like it because it

390.479 --> 404.8
supposedly proves ether as the light the

398.919 --> 408.909
supposed medium effect right like how

404.8 --> 411.849
does the medium of like oh that carries

408.909 --> 416.49899999999997
light work effectively presupposing the

411.849 --> 418.389
ether and that kind of backs it up yeah

416.499 --> 422.589
well it's not surprising they don't

418.389 --> 425.169
bring that up very often they probably

422.589 --> 429.36899999999997
won't appreciate it being called an

425.169 --> 434.81899999999996
experiment I don't know if it is not

429.369 --> 438.27900000000005
entirely sure now what it's supposed to

434.819 --> 443.079
prove I don't know if it is effectively

438.279 --> 448.979
an experiment I am Not sure I would have

443.079 --> 448.979
to look into it a little bit more

455.31 --> 458.0
Wow

460.96 --> 468.88
huh I see luminiferous ether and then a

465.009 --> 471.41900000000004
picture of the heliocentric model and

468.88 --> 474.43
then the luminous ether in the universe

471.419 --> 480.00899999999996
overlaying all that yeah that's the

474.43 --> 482.889
that's just special but anyway it is

480.009 --> 485.16
about mirror reflecting in motion and

482.889 --> 485.16
stuff

495.27 --> 504.07
thirty years of things no but you

497.83 --> 506.05
experiments look this is about about the

504.07 --> 515.95
nature of science and when you can call

506.05 --> 518.13
it an experiment or not they couldn't

515.95 --> 522.58
detect the earth spinning and no doubt

518.13 --> 527.1
but yeah I don't know what this would

522.58 --> 527.1
have to do with that specifically

543.0 --> 545.78
mm-hmm

550.3 --> 560.1099999999999
yeah man but yeah the michelson-morley

554.18 --> 563.2099999999999
has moved past my radar many times I

560.11 --> 565.69
just never really deeply looked into it

563.21 --> 570.97
I just knew it had something to do with

565.69 --> 570.97
whatever was being discussed at the time

572.62 --> 576.13
it's been a while

589.61 --> 598.279
I don't know I'll have to get back to

592.699 --> 599.17
you about this one but I even remembered

598.279 --> 602.36
this

599.17 --> 604.579
well this effect this test what they're

602.36 --> 609.7090000000001
doing I remember being confronted with

604.579 --> 614.3599999999999
that like even in the late 90s but that

609.709 --> 618.0089999999999
was way before yeah my whole view on it

614.36 --> 618.009
sharpen up a lot more

623.79 --> 637.5899999999999
qe has a vid or two on it yeah I

627.76 --> 637.59
wouldn't be surprised right

643.0 --> 652.389
now look guys don't worry about it

646.5 --> 654.37
I'm just being kind of slow here I don't

652.389 --> 659.649
remember whether it was a proper

654.37 --> 665.019
experiment or not I know that what it

659.649 --> 666.819
does it does refuel certain things but

665.019 --> 670.8100000000001
if that is worthy enough to call it an

666.819 --> 674.279
experiment that's something else I'll

670.81 --> 674.279
have to ask you about that

682.279 --> 687.279
what forced Einstein to remove ether

685.279 --> 692.48
well

687.279 --> 696.05
the relativity theory the idea that

692.48 --> 700.97
things could move in relation to other

696.05 --> 703.069
things as it were and that yeah it would

700.97 --> 705.769
be relative like there would not

703.069 --> 710.12
necessarily be all these motion effects

705.769 --> 712.37
be applied because of the of the special

710.12 --> 715.009
motion but because it is all relative it

712.37 --> 718.699
was basically through the relative

715.009 --> 721.5500000000001
through that concept they could discard

718.699 --> 723.769
the inquiry like now you're not gonna

721.55 --> 725.6289999999999
feel it moving around the Sun and all

723.769 --> 728.029
that because it's all relative that's

725.629 --> 731.029
kind of what I thought that was for and

728.029 --> 736.16
the ether was in the way because the

731.029 --> 739.66
ether is kind of set to special yeah

736.16 --> 744.43
towards it the more to a Euclidean

739.66 --> 744.43
conception of reality as it were

758.97 --> 766.35
so I hope I got that right I do a lot

764.73 --> 769.5790000000001
better with these subjects in the winter

766.35 --> 769.5790000000001
when it's not so freakin warm

772.11 --> 775.169
[Music]

782.339 --> 789.269
then I take it lady had to bring it back

784.769 --> 791.49
for general relativity Wow

789.269 --> 795.2090000000001
right well he was basically just

791.49 --> 799.35
juggling with it he was just like let's

795.209 --> 802.41
just imagine it's altered yeah one

799.35 --> 805.7090000000001
wizards do so he was basically juggling

802.41 --> 807.779
the concept kind of out of the way like

805.709 --> 811.399
let's just disregard that for the time

807.779 --> 811.399
being because it can work otherwise

819.89 --> 823.6999999999999
although I don't know where Einstein

821.51 --> 826.97
eventually got stuck you know maybe he

823.7 --> 829.49
did kind of concede that this is all

826.97 --> 832.85
[ __ ] in the end I don't know I don't

829.49 --> 837.2
know too much about him what happened to

832.85 --> 839.99
him eventually I just know he married

837.2 --> 843.129
his cousin and all that

839.99 --> 843.129
[Music]

853.07 --> 857.73
right anyway

854.63 --> 857.73
[Music]

865.96 --> 868.96
hmm

900.89 --> 906.21
all right anyway yeah any other subjects

903.81 --> 911.7199999999999
you guys so want to want me to dig into

906.21 --> 911.72
I can't it's warm here

929.699 --> 933.049
load up mondo

942.21 --> 948.73
yeah guys how did you how much did you

945.64 --> 960.25
like my hangout yesterday the idea of

948.73 --> 965.26
the sea trans realm in not trans realm

960.25 --> 969.12
it's just interconnected realm left to

965.26 --> 969.12
system and all that

975.63 --> 981.62
I thought it was pretty cool you missed

979.41 --> 981.62
it

990.92 --> 995.5999999999999
I'll just watch it back it was pretty

993.45 --> 995.6
good

1001.139 --> 1017.549
and I'm just cooking here I'm literally

1003.899 --> 1019.199
just sweating out of nothing yes yeah

1017.549 --> 1021.8389999999999
because the wind has gone down

1019.199 --> 1024.259
significantly it gets so hot when that

1021.839 --> 1024.259
happens

1026.349 --> 1029.4489999999998
[Music]

1041.52 --> 1050.76
oculus will you be able to observe the

1045.13 --> 1050.7600000000002
occupation I don't know what

1056.37 --> 1073.2199999999998
is there another celestial thing going

1059.039 --> 1073.22
up okay

1076.31 --> 1084.26
Venus is going behind the moon oh okay

1080.17 --> 1085.6100000000001
that does sound interesting I wonder if

1084.26 --> 1092.71
you'll be able to see it through the

1085.61 --> 1097.31
dark side I don't think regular stars

1092.71 --> 1102.17
can do that but maybe Venus could you

1097.31 --> 1104.53
know I don't know that would be

1102.17 --> 1104.53
fascinating

1116.89 --> 1123.68
you know if it will be if it'll be

1119.51 --> 1129.73
happening yeah baller land is gonna go

1123.68 --> 1132.6200000000001
nuts and there's gonna be more weird

1129.73 --> 1134.96
illusion based tales of them how that's

1132.62 --> 1137.6299999999999
supposed to be possible like there's

1134.96 --> 1139.7
this unique atmospheric refractive

1137.63 --> 1142.67
effect that allows the light of the

1139.7 --> 1145.22
planet just from the right angle to

1142.67 --> 1148.3400000000001
shine as if it is coming right through

1145.22 --> 1151.04
the moon something like that you know

1148.34 --> 1154.0
like I could literally just I'm a spot

1151.04 --> 1158.96
conjure up a nonsense explanation to

1154.0 --> 1163.01
justify why it looks like that on a

1158.96 --> 1165.95
heliocentric model if that were to

1163.01 --> 1172.16
happen you know it's gonna they're gonna

1165.95 --> 1188.68
do that I love presupposition of

1172.16 --> 1194.53
Cascades yeah I am Arwen I am The

1188.68 --> 1200.27
Accidental leading edge of globe fiction

1194.53 --> 1201.76
because I just can't help it automated

1200.27 --> 1206.77
mechanician

1201.76 --> 1206.77
spring forth out of boredom

1212.8 --> 1218.54
no and frustration you know I was very

1216.02 --> 1221.5
look in a way I wish that the world

1218.54 --> 1224.12
would have been turned around like that

1221.5 --> 1228.59
globe religion would actually be really

1224.12 --> 1232.9099999999999
good for some reason you know that's

1228.59 --> 1236.1799999999998
what I thought originally like and then

1232.91 --> 1245.5700000000002
you find out like what is happening

1236.18 --> 1247.8700000000001
because of the lies and yeah it's a big

1245.57 --> 1247.87
disappointment

1264.36 --> 1280.11
God is behind the ball our deception I

1268.44 --> 1280.1100000000001
don't know that's what in what sense

1281.55 --> 1292.09
you think he designed it as a controlled

1286.15 --> 1295.8100000000002
oppositional move hmm could be maybe

1292.09 --> 1301.48
only God Himself would be cohesive

1295.81 --> 1304.3899999999999
enough to design a thing to that quality

1301.48 --> 1307.92
degree because regular man that would

1304.39 --> 1310.5700000000002
resort to lies just simply cannot uphold

1307.92 --> 1313.8700000000001
the energies and all that required in

1310.57 --> 1318.4299999999998
order to even get to that design so

1313.87 --> 1325.75
maybe or you could consider that that

1318.43 --> 1330.76
devil made it up you know devil God you

1325.75 --> 1333.84
know it's can control the position kind

1330.76 --> 1333.84
of comes down to the same thing

1333.87 --> 1336.87
virtually

1373.72 --> 1376.5
why

1377.27 --> 1384.59
he is trying to deceive those close to

1379.82 --> 1385.72
him but equips them also not to fall for

1384.59 --> 1391.51
it

1385.72 --> 1391.51
what like from what perspective

1396.9 --> 1406.65
okay isn't it look even like how I've

1400.35 --> 1410.25
seen it in a more positive light like

1406.65 --> 1414.1100000000001
the globe is a test it it could be like

1410.25 --> 1422.309
a mind youth test for critical thinking

1414.11 --> 1425.76
versus dreaming so it's just that the

1422.309 --> 1429.84
the mind control aspect of it has grown

1425.76 --> 1435.99
out of proportion and has become like a

1429.84 --> 1439.08
a harvested system that is being

1435.99 --> 1443.04
exploited I don't think that that even

1439.08 --> 1445.77
was the original idea behind its

1443.04 --> 1448.3799999999999
creation maybe behind the the ones who

1445.77 --> 1451.32
gave the orders or who eventually use

1448.38 --> 1453.63
utilized it but I don't even know if the

1451.32 --> 1462.12
idea of the conception was even meant to

1453.63 --> 1466.6200000000001
be anything other than a mind test like

1462.12 --> 1469.08
a challenge like can you like tell you

1466.62 --> 1472.32
the dream and then you have to figure

1469.08 --> 1474.57
out that it is a dream and not real you

1472.32 --> 1479.45
would have to get proper guidance with

1474.57 --> 1479.45
that of course see you in school

1480.77 --> 1486.929
but yeah now nowadays the yeah that

1484.08 --> 1490.1299999999999
doesn't work anymore everything is being

1486.929 --> 1490.13
too much exploited

1502.18 --> 1508.18
[Music]

1537.28 --> 1541.31
all right eyes wide shut

1539.72 --> 1545.32
are you mean do you mean like the

1541.31 --> 1550.3899999999999
supposed satellites satellite lights

1545.32 --> 1554.1799999999998
just regular moving speed just lights

1550.39 --> 1557.0300000000002
that are kind of said when I asked about

1554.18 --> 1558.98
like what is that and then some helia

1557.03 --> 1561.35
centrist will immediately see that

1558.98 --> 1563.09
that's a satellite because it's a light

1561.35 --> 1565.48
and it's moving at a constant speed so

1563.09 --> 1569.06
they're just assuming it's a satellite

1565.48 --> 1574.34
that's how I originally learned that but

1569.06 --> 1576.5
yeah just yeah people see them they're

1574.34 --> 1580.9599999999998
not a super rare phenomena especially if

1576.5 --> 1580.96
you have like a sensitive night camera

1606.64 --> 1613.2900000000002
and no need to get angry they're mine

1610.99 --> 1613.29
God

1619.59 --> 1622.6799999999998
[Music]

1626.16 --> 1629.3300000000002
what's going on

1638.52 --> 1644.24
so mine of God having a Bible cellphone

1641.46 --> 1644.24
yay moment again

1656.21 --> 1660.1000000000001
yeah you shouldn't do that in mind God

1663.249 --> 1669.83
everybody deals with the Bible in their

1666.049 --> 1671.47
own way based on what they can handle in

1669.83 --> 1674.149
their life

1671.47 --> 1679.659
you can't force that you can tell people

1674.149 --> 1682.5189999999998
like you're doing it completely wrong

1679.659 --> 1686.98
right what you could do is just point

1682.519 --> 1689.99
out what the actual sin error

1686.98 --> 1692.3600000000001
misconception is the literal thing and

1689.99 --> 1694.6
then leave it to that that kind of can

1692.36 --> 1694.6
work

1706.029 --> 1713.2
what mars be stationary and then

1709.809 --> 1718.269
literally move across the sky did he

1713.2 --> 1726.099
record it because sounds like not very

1718.269 --> 1730.33
logical unless it was like in the middle

1726.099 --> 1733.529
of the cycle switch but yeah that's not

1730.33 --> 1733.529
gonna be a quick movement

1743.31 --> 1746.09
hmm

1749.23 --> 1755.08
alright it just saying it could have

1751.059 --> 1763.0
been something else because yeah planets

1755.08 --> 1766.9289999999999
don't visibly move they might move just

1763.0 --> 1768.58
as the moon sort of moves if you just

1766.929 --> 1770.5900000000001
put the camera still in the direction

1768.58 --> 1773.1689999999999
then the moon will move past it and

1770.59 --> 1775.48
probably the planets do that too it's

1773.169 --> 1777.13
not going to visibly move like that you

1775.48 --> 1781.26
can actually pick up the motion with

1777.13 --> 1781.2600000000002
your eyes that doesn't happen

1818.84 --> 1821.59
hmm

1825.49 --> 1832.299
yeah Oh Missouri bird like the falling

1828.429 --> 1836.2
star affecting all that it it happens in

1832.299 --> 1839.08
between well the other stars if those

1836.2 --> 1842.919
are visible enough usually they would

1839.08 --> 1845.11
have to be it doesn't fall before it

1842.919 --> 1850.3500000000001
it's not closer no it's pretty much if

1845.11 --> 1852.76
you see lights just as stars moving

1850.35 --> 1857.289
usually quickly yeah it's got to move

1852.76 --> 1859.72
exactly at the edge of vision you know

1857.289 --> 1863.5
when it's that like literally the

1859.72 --> 1867.159
migrating lights the little lights but

1863.5 --> 1868.899
if it's going to be the physical type

1867.159 --> 1871.48
falling star a phenomena where you

1868.899 --> 1876.6589999999999
literally see and potentially hear the

1871.48 --> 1876.659
glitter you know that's something else

1877.409 --> 1883.679
it should be something else please tell

1880.149 --> 1883.6789999999999
me it's something else it's still weird

1889.08 --> 1894.03
like it doesn't it yeah just think about

1892.35 --> 1897.1699999999998
it like even if it was like a little

1894.03 --> 1900.44
piece of metal glittering going on

1897.17 --> 1904.17
falling burning up giving off that light

1900.44 --> 1907.8600000000001
you wouldn't be able to see that super

1904.17 --> 1910.0800000000002
far away that's impossible like it

1907.86 --> 1915.1799999999998
because of the because it's just too

1910.08 --> 1918.0
small so falling stars like that that I

1915.18 --> 1922.3100000000002
remember seeing relatively up close

1918.0 --> 1925.92
hearing the glitter and all that that

1922.31 --> 1928.23
those stars stars are calling it stars

1925.92 --> 1930.77
those things would not be able to you

1928.23 --> 1934.64
wouldn't be able to see that at a very

1930.77 --> 1939.54
long distance you just wouldn't see it

1934.64 --> 1943.17
because it's not enough and an angular

1939.54 --> 1945.81
size becomes too small now when it comes

1943.17 --> 1952.28
to the falling stars that we kind of see

1945.81 --> 1957.12
up there in the backdrop that cannot be

1952.28 --> 1959.76
thousands of miles away because what are

1957.12 --> 1962.1299999999999
those old folders like this just flying

1959.76 --> 1966.39
by and giving no that makes no damn

1962.13 --> 1969.8100000000002
sense no it seems much more like a globe

1966.39 --> 1972.48
of the heavens light effect like just

1969.81 --> 1974.9299999999998
like the star Sun in the moon virtual

1972.48 --> 1978.81
not a physical object up there and

1974.93 --> 1983.04
apparently falling stars on the backdrop

1978.81 --> 1987.54
might be a part of that light output

1983.04 --> 1991.23
effect the pattern of it but very

1987.54 --> 1994.35
different visually also very does you do

1991.23 --> 1995.33
see it but it's very far away very far

1994.35 --> 1998.51
away

1995.33 --> 2003.85
compared to yeah literally seeing a rock

1998.51 --> 2003.85
break up glitter here it

2005.59 --> 2012.799
got a crackling of it you don't have

2009.889 --> 2014.9599999999998
that with like falling stars up there so

2012.799 --> 2018.97
I think that those things are rather

2014.96 --> 2023.45
light patterns they're not actually

2018.97 --> 2024.309
rocks flying and burning up I don't

2023.45 --> 2027.32
think so

2024.309 --> 2031.34
but they do seem to be these weird rocks

2027.32 --> 2033.789
that do burn off and get close I can't

2031.34 --> 2033.789
explain it

2042.59 --> 2046.98
yeah it's too bad tiny wubble because

2045.24 --> 2050.28
you don't know what the hell is going on

2046.98 --> 2053.61
either you just believe in the story

2050.28 --> 2056.9700000000003
because it's just confusing it's just

2053.61 --> 2061.29
confusing isn't it like yeah but aren't

2056.97 --> 2063.0899999999997
they the same thing no they're not one

2061.29 --> 2066.0299999999997
you can actually prove they have a

2063.09 --> 2069.69
distance to you there is sound coming

2066.03 --> 2072.5400000000004
off them you could potentially think of

2069.69 --> 2074.34
a way to emulate that even taking the

2072.54 --> 2077.69
right like manganese or something and

2074.34 --> 2081.6290000000004
then burning it up yeah that happens

2077.69 --> 2083.31
like that well you can't do that with

2081.629 --> 2087.649
the high up falling stars and they're

2083.31 --> 2087.649
really not alike at all

2093.609 --> 2102.5789999999997
or hey I'd love to see a close-up

2097.349 --> 2106.239
where's the high high altitude balloon

2102.579 --> 2108.369
footage in August when there's

2106.239 --> 2110.619
supposedly a lot of falling stars where

2108.369 --> 2114.73
is the balloon getting up close and

2110.619 --> 2116.559
filming that like where they should

2114.73 --> 2120.94
literally see the rocks getting

2116.559 --> 2125.23
relatively close where is it I want to

2120.94 --> 2126.94
see that and I give a [ __ ] if you think

2125.23 --> 2129.88
the earth is a globe or a flat or

2126.94 --> 2131.92
whatever I just want to see that can

2129.88 --> 2136.1400000000003
somebody please give me a close-up of

2131.92 --> 2139.859
actual falling stars up there a close-up

2136.14 --> 2143.759
real the real thing not some CGI [ __ ]

2139.859 --> 2143.759
please anyone

2147.45 --> 2152.019
[Music]

2160.48 --> 2163.69
[Music]

2165.91 --> 2168.5989999999997
hmm

2189.74 --> 2201.89
yeah okay yeah there's a lot of this is

2193.7 --> 2205.52
like the last the last border where

2201.89 --> 2208.49
ballers and flat-earthers can still meet

2205.52 --> 2215.18
in peace I like to think that this is

2208.49 --> 2217.8199999999997
like like Babylon 5 it's a bit awkward

2215.18 --> 2221.45
now I realizing what that actually means

2217.82 --> 2224.1800000000003
and all that but like that series that's

2221.45 --> 2226.22
exactly what that Space Station was like

2224.18 --> 2228.71
it was like where everybody's like the

2226.22 --> 2235.7599999999998
last place where you can still meet even

2228.71 --> 2242.21
with enemies and yeah I like to think

2235.76 --> 2245.2700000000004
that my chat is kind of that place so

2242.21 --> 2249.04
yeah sometimes a brawl does break out it

2245.27 --> 2249.04
definitely does happen at times

2250.21 --> 2254.12
especially if there's a lot of stuff

2252.68 --> 2261.5299999999997
happening out there that affects

2254.12 --> 2263.69
everyone everybody gets all and nerfed

2261.53 --> 2270.07
looking for a target and yeah you're

2263.69 --> 2273.46
gonna look for the opponent so yeah

2270.07 --> 2273.46
return to equilibrium

2280.4 --> 2289.44
does that effectively mean like jump in

2283.86 --> 2291.63
a pool because that does sound like a

2289.44 --> 2297.33
good idea to me or maybe that's just

2291.63 --> 2300.15
what I saw in that because yeah it went

2297.33 --> 2301.71
yeah boy I have to breathe in but if you

2300.15 --> 2303.4500000000003
jump in a pool you breathe in yeah

2301.71 --> 2308.66
you're gonna find an equilibrium point

2303.45 --> 2308.66
and just float fresh water

2319.4 --> 2322.15
what

2323.91 --> 2326.969
[Music]

2346.119 --> 2352.0190000000002
why would you bring that up my [ __ ]

2349.63 --> 2352.0190000000002
kind of

2369.229 --> 2372.229
okay

2373.79 --> 2381.56
that's been a long time since I looked

2376.13 --> 2383.27
into that lor dank I kind of stopped

2381.56 --> 2386.5099999999998
playing the game so with the world of

2383.27 --> 2388.22
warcraft before it was just the warcraft

2386.51 --> 2391.5200000000004
games and i really liked playing those

2388.22 --> 2393.56
it's like a basic strategy system with

2391.52 --> 2396.29
the story that's kind of interesting

2393.56 --> 2398.69
I didn't really like the graphics though

2396.29 --> 2404.75
they those it's too cartoonish for

2398.69 --> 2408.02
myself for my favor but yeah there is

2404.75 --> 2410.14
about just dimensional portals stuff and

2408.02 --> 2410.14
all that

2418.63 --> 2423.369
it's like in a way Warcraft is very much

2421.18 --> 2426.489
inspired on a cosmology that is very

2423.369 --> 2433.7490000000003
similar to the Dungeons & Dragons inter

2426.489 --> 2439.119
planar cosmology where the orcs come

2433.749 --> 2445.8089999999997
from their own dimension which is sort

2439.119 --> 2449.9100000000003
of hell then there's even worse places

2445.809 --> 2449.9100000000003
and then there's the heavens too I think

2456.13 --> 2462.87
all right anyway let's get back to

2460.84 --> 2462.8700000000003
reality

2475.69 --> 2483.3
all right but anyway to answer that

2477.94 --> 2489.79
question mine of God it is only if you

2483.3 --> 2510.19
realize it to be you're gonna have to

2489.79 --> 2513.49
take that for what it's worth now not

2510.19 --> 2517.23
good servant servant of God the the

2513.49 --> 2517.2299999999996
other guy my new god I mean

2526.57 --> 2531.6400000000003
so interest seeing the video and what

2529.21 --> 2539.11
seems to be a rock passing a skydive

2531.64 --> 2539.44
sure I'm interested to see that all

2539.11 --> 2544.8700000000003
right

2539.44 --> 2548.23
well mind of God I think that I just

2544.87 --> 2550.56
it's is ethereal so don't think I got

2548.23 --> 2552.7
this from Scripture or anything but I'm

2550.56 --> 2556.6
starting to be more confident that the

2552.7 --> 2560.3199999999997
physical realm is like both heaven

2556.6 --> 2563.23
heaven and hell and it all depends on

2560.32 --> 2567.13
how you interface with it with your

2563.23 --> 2569.83
consciousness and if you interface with

2567.13 --> 2572.11
it from a hellish perspective then the

2569.83 --> 2574.0299999999997
Dark One's will find you and will

2572.11 --> 2580.06
entangle themselves with you and if you

2574.03 --> 2586.0
interface with it from a divine yea

2580.06 --> 2591.22
Christ perspective then exactly the

2586.0 --> 2593.37
opposite kind of happens and you just

2591.22 --> 2596.7599999999998
find that there is a protected

2593.37 --> 2600.0099999999998
lightworkers Network naturally going on

2596.76 --> 2605.13
it's like two different societies that

2600.01 --> 2605.13
are both integrated in the same thing

2612.47 --> 2620.3199999999997
I always have to say that

2630.769 --> 2637.8799999999997
what is the freaking point of constantly

2633.589 --> 2641.069
blurting that out pisses me off

2637.88 --> 2643.6400000000003
it's like why why do you want that why

2641.069 --> 2648.39
do you want that in your mind's eye is

2643.64 --> 2650.64
there really necessary isn't it enough

2648.39 --> 2652.71
that the earth is not a freaking ball

2650.64 --> 2657.99
and all that nonsense no you have to

2652.71 --> 2660.359
really push it to that why literally

2657.99 --> 2664.9399999999996
conjuring up a portal of Hell for

2660.359 --> 2664.94
yourself you keep that [ __ ] in your mind

2688.47 --> 2699.93
yeah it was referring to I was doing

2694.12 --> 2699.93
that I think it was

2702.06 --> 2709.7999999999997
yeah Missouri bear just pisses me off

2706.17 --> 2712.05
it's like every time somebody says that

2709.8 --> 2715.0800000000004
it's like like there's this giant

2712.05 --> 2717.6600000000003
monster sitting and he's like a person

2715.08 --> 2721.23
or not oh really really so you have

2717.66 --> 2724.0499999999997
proof for that or is it just this period

2721.23 --> 2726.27
of Satan that is inherent to the

2724.05 --> 2729.11
functions of our consciousness and the

2726.27 --> 2732.68
design and all that that manages to

2729.11 --> 2735.54
naturally find its way to the peak of

2732.68 --> 2737.85
control because that is what that spirit

2735.54 --> 2744.56
seeks out but it's not a unified thing

2737.85 --> 2750.0499999999997
it's a collective agreement of separate

2744.56 --> 2753.99
like wills that pursue that frequency in

2750.05 --> 2760.3500000000004
multiple individuals it's not a it's not

2753.99 --> 2768.14
a creature this there's no proof all

2760.35 --> 2768.14
right it's a title sure

2774.52 --> 2780.07
a minor God you really need to tone down

2777.25 --> 2783.88
the way you're addressing people in my

2780.07 --> 2786.67
chat because this is starting to just

2783.88 --> 2791.4100000000003
get really bad you're acting like a

2786.67 --> 2795.12
complete self Aigner you're poking for

2791.41 --> 2795.12
no good reason like that

2814.6 --> 2822.89
Satan is a spiritual sense not a

2818.09 --> 2826.8500000000004
physical being a spiritual sense Oh or

2822.89 --> 2829.64
you could call it a mindset it's a form

2826.85 --> 2833.8399999999997
of dwelling it's the the hierarchical

2829.64 --> 2838.0099999999998
design that naturally happens in the

2833.84 --> 2844.6400000000003
mind when one is seduced to pursue the

2838.01 --> 2849.4300000000003
darker frequencies the mind reshapes

2844.64 --> 2849.43
itself and it becomes like that

2862.32 --> 2866.9900000000002
but creates evil in the human mind

2869.45 --> 2880.56
confrontation and dwellings over those

2875.58 --> 2883.0699999999997
confrontations false sense of

2880.56 --> 2883.07
powerlessness

2893.98 --> 2901.16
yeah and ignorance really you know

2897.77 --> 2905.66
ignorance is not a bad thing at first

2901.16 --> 2908.39
but when somebody like on purpose starts

2905.66 --> 2911.24
to ignore starts to weapon not weaponize

2908.39 --> 2913.91
their own ignorance to keep that

2911.24 --> 2917.0899999999997
information out then it becomes evil

2913.91 --> 2929.18
then it will draw in evil acts evil

2917.09 --> 2933.4900000000002
frequencies what makes the man want to

2929.18 --> 2933.49
end another life suffering

2937.65 --> 2946.7400000000002
and pressure the fantasy and potential

2943.619 --> 2954.119
planning that it would met that it would

2946.74 --> 2956.7299999999996
matter in some way but the direct need

2954.119 --> 2959.539
to just kill somebody is always due to

2956.73 --> 2959.539
suffering

2961.73 --> 2964.86
[Music]

2971.37 --> 2977.46
no it's always suffering always doesn't

2975.27 --> 2979.98
matter where that suffering is coming

2977.46 --> 2982.98
from what does matter a lot but it is

2979.98 --> 2994.89
effectively the only thing that can do

2982.98 --> 2998.55
that yeah unless you are like I don't

2994.89 --> 3001.54
know will severely psychotic psychopath

2998.55 --> 3007.6000000000004
and then maybe random [ __ ] like that but

3001.54 --> 3007.6
ya know people can do that normal people

3009.46 --> 3015.38
like like you think about it like all

3012.77 --> 3018.61
the reasons as to why people decide to

3015.38 --> 3021.65
do that it's always going to be

3018.61 --> 3024.83
suffering or the idea like if I don't do

3021.65 --> 3028.81
it then somebody else may get hurt or I

3024.83 --> 3034.33
have to survive but yeah

3028.81 --> 3034.33
there's always has to be a reason for it

3039.7 --> 3044.5
and if there's no suffering in often why

3042.369 --> 3048.0
would you why would you even engage in

3044.5 --> 3048.0
doing that yeah

3086.19 --> 3100.21
okay yeah oh my god

3090.16 --> 3103.1499999999996
go away like go outside take your shoes

3100.21 --> 3108.779
and your socks off and go walk in the

3103.15 --> 3108.779
grass calm the [ __ ] down bro

3123.21 --> 3126.86
[Music]

3127.92 --> 3133.119
yeah I did that this morning right away

3130.589 --> 3135.069
while waiting on the store to open

3133.119 --> 3137.1600000000003
because there was a little park I

3135.069 --> 3140.46
haven't been there for a long time and

3137.16 --> 3143.2
yeah was light nice good-looking grass

3140.46 --> 3145.299
the piece of shadow and I had took my

3143.2 --> 3148.45
shoes off and my suction just walked out

3145.299 --> 3150.46
there in the grass and it was it's like

3148.45 --> 3153.0389999999998
ah why haven't I done that more often

3150.46 --> 3157.48
that feeling like immediately overcomes

3153.039 --> 3160.9
you cuz yeah a lot of energy stuff

3157.48 --> 3169.0
happens it really like touches the nerve

3160.9 --> 3170.589
system when I do that what the heck is

3169.0 --> 3173.819
wrong with my Oh God I don't know he's

3170.589 --> 3173.819
on his period or something

3185.44 --> 3191.53
and when he's like that he just like

3188.89 --> 3193.18
everything everybody says to him he

3191.53 --> 3194.9500000000003
always responds like they're stepping on

3193.18 --> 3197.2
his dick or something that's I don't

3194.95 --> 3204.85
know he's been like that a couple of

3197.2 --> 3207.6899999999996
times but right to hand gets like that

3204.85 --> 3207.69
to a lot

3232.91 --> 3239.37
[Music]

3261.65 --> 3272.2690000000002
he's got the fog of Jesus no no no no

3267.859 --> 3275.15
that's not the fog of Jesus no it's a

3272.269 --> 3279.319
rage for justice I know it that's not

3275.15 --> 3281.779
Jesus rather say it's Odin it's like

3279.319 --> 3283.999
it's the only way that I can explain

3281.779 --> 3292.249
it's like it's it's like this burning

3283.999 --> 3296.089
nagging need to set things straight and

3292.249 --> 3299.779
yet it literally drives people psychotic

3296.089 --> 3303.17
and it's the powerlessness that really

3299.779 --> 3307.069
does that or the perceived powerlessness

3303.17 --> 3309.079
did just wanting to get it out of the

3307.069 --> 3311.93
way right now but not knowing how to do

3309.079 --> 3312.8900000000003
it and then you just start to go push

3311.93 --> 3315.23
people around

3312.89 --> 3317.569
it's very common thing really it's part

3315.23 --> 3319.9900000000002
of human nature too especially with a

3317.569 --> 3319.99
lot of men

3334.32 --> 3338.79
and right and that I'm calling it like

3336.57 --> 3341.27
spirit of Odin doesn't mean anything

3338.79 --> 3346.29
it's not like oh my god I'm now a

3341.27 --> 3349.92
pantheist no it's it's the only way any

3346.29 --> 3354.0
other thing close that in like in the

3349.92 --> 3357.27
grand scheme of frequencies that I can

3354.0 --> 3360.66
relate to in any sort of way maybe I

3357.27 --> 3367.31
could like take one of the Greek gods or

3360.66 --> 3367.31
something compared to that I don't know

3375.699 --> 3381.89
but the ads frequency the idea of a

3378.859 --> 3393.7889999999998
frequency effect result the spirit and

3381.89 --> 3400.819
mindset yeah and Jesus Jesus does not

3393.789 --> 3403.5190000000002
dwell on anger and he does not like seek

3400.819 --> 3409.369
out war does not go and poke other

3403.519 --> 3415.5789999999997
people he corrects mistakes he overturns

3409.369 --> 3418.539
corruption when he spots it but he

3415.579 --> 3423.8900000000003
doesn't like go out and pick a fight

3418.539 --> 3426.559
that's another spirit see what I mean

3423.89 --> 3429.89
that's like looking out hungry for

3426.559 --> 3432.17
revenge like a hungry dog and that's not

3429.89 --> 3435.2889999999998
Christ that's not the frequency of

3432.17 --> 3439.9990000000003
Christ when you got that got to be clear

3435.289 --> 3441.92
about that that because it is the same

3439.999 --> 3445.959
spirit that feels a lot of devil

3441.92 --> 3445.9590000000003
persecution is not Christian

3456.27 --> 3467.29
well Red Sox who says that it didn't I I

3463.24 --> 3468.8489999999997
have I don't know fair suspicion you

3467.29 --> 3471.55
could call it I don't know I'm not a

3468.849 --> 3474.9700000000003
super wide historian researcher you know

3471.55 --> 3477.76
that I have belief at least that the

3474.97 --> 3481.1189999999997
Pantheon does exist or did exist or

3477.76 --> 3486.4
exists and their specific type of rules

3481.119 --> 3490.15
to the Creator and that they were later

3486.4 --> 3493.2000000000003
rewritten if I if I can call it that

3490.15 --> 3499.9
into the Fallen Angels perhaps or

3493.2 --> 3501.9399999999996
approached in another way now that does

3499.9 --> 3504.94
not that shouldn't be true that those

3501.94 --> 3510.2200000000003
were the sons of God so there may have

3504.94 --> 3512.08
been a pantheon and yeah then things

3510.22 --> 3514.5899999999997
happened between the creator and the

3512.08 --> 3514.59
pantheon

3530.43 --> 3538.8289999999997
and it is so very difficult because I'm

3533.069 --> 3541.829
dealing with just very complex things

3538.829 --> 3544.1090000000004
that we're dealing with the fuel of the

3541.829 --> 3548.13
fabric of the reality even that we

3544.109 --> 3550.8289999999997
experience here so is any of it has it

3548.13 --> 3552.75
ever been absolutely physically literal

3550.829 --> 3557.0890000000004
and why would it need to be or is this

3552.75 --> 3560.64
just the ethereal web of the spirits and

3557.089 --> 3564.54
the gods and the Creator are just like

3560.64 --> 3567.8689999999997
this pattern that manifests naturally in

3564.54 --> 3574.589
the spiritual realm as a consequence of

3567.869 --> 3575.579
creation you know maybe that's it yeah

3574.589 --> 3579.48
I'm just trying to

3575.579 --> 3583.4100000000003
I don't know stay as scientific as I can

3579.48 --> 3585.51
in a way well duh not correct or not I'm

3583.41 --> 3588.8999999999996
trying to keep it as real as I can but

3585.51 --> 3591.809
also keep a very open mind and not be

3588.9 --> 3595.2000000000003
fearful of like personified revenge

3591.809 --> 3601.3190000000004
because of my curiousness because I mean

3595.2 --> 3603.47
no harm I mean only to understand right
