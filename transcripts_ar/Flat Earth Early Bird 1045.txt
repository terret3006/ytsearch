Cloudy and hazy

morning

122.64 --> 130.099
but yeah that quickly went away

126.36 --> 130.099
so now it's just like this

134.22 --> 139.379
uh there is a bit of some coming through

136.56 --> 142.16

139.379 --> 142.16
all right

159.78 --> 165.2

Shatner's bassoon

190.739 --> 195.56
of seeking star water gaining wisdom huh

201.56 --> 208.519
I think

203.819 --> 208.51899999999998
the the current lingo is

209.04 --> 212.17999999999998
go Brandon

212.879 --> 215.599
wasn't it

220.08 --> 225.42000000000002
because yeah there's been in recent few

223.019 --> 228.12
days I I've noticed like people saying

225.42 --> 230.28
like oh go Brandon like randomly in chat

228.12 --> 232.799
here and there and I was like what is

230.28 --> 234.18
this Brandon thing let's go Brandon

232.799 --> 237.59900000000002
that's right

234.18 --> 241.20000000000002
but that's actually based on

237.599 --> 244.5
how some newscast interpreted

241.2 --> 248.04
what a stadium was chanting which was f

244.5 --> 250.439
y and F Biden and then

248.04 --> 253.62
like the commentator said oh they're

250.439 --> 256.32
just saying let's go Brandon

253.62 --> 260.699
so now it's like a meme everybody just

256.32 --> 263.28
instead of f Biden F Joe Biden they say

260.699 --> 264.96000000000004
let's go Brandon in chat I've noticed

263.28 --> 267.79999999999995
that

264.96 --> 267.79999999999995
it's funny

267.96 --> 270.62
huh

273.02 --> 276.38
CGI Joe

279.18 --> 281.96
that's funny

303.479 --> 309.8
the song Hit number one what do you mean

307.259 --> 309.8
this song

316.4 --> 320.0

320.639 --> 323.36
huh

326.639 --> 332.40000000000003
ah it's cold yeah

329.699 --> 334.199
I was actually thinking of putting on my

332.4 --> 336.59999999999997
radiator

334.199 --> 339.36
heat lamp but

336.6 --> 342.139
just settle for the sweater

339.36 --> 342.139
uh-huh

343.44 --> 348.38
yeah it's 50 degrees Celsius over here

349.139 --> 353.78000000000003
so yeah not exactly warm

353.82 --> 358.52
a rap song Let's go Brandon okay

360.18 --> 365.88
well it was bound to happen that

362.759 --> 368.41900000000004
some somebody would quickly do something

365.88 --> 368.419
with that

370.74 --> 376.639
now you can't drink in the pool

373.8 --> 376.639
uh

379.62 --> 384.919
I probably still could if you were

381.84 --> 384.919
somewhere near the equator

400.52 --> 406.28
oh George Sanford oh good servant hello

journalism ill-nighter oh really

448.5 --> 451.039
huh

454.44 --> 457.819
late night show

460.08 --> 466.21999999999997
whoa three and a half hours yeah that is

463.74 --> 466.22
quite long

467.34 --> 471.84
or was that just the part on YouTube and

469.8 --> 473.94
did he do the rest on rockfin or

471.84 --> 476.479
something

473.94 --> 476.479
thank you

491.22 --> 496.97900000000004
the amount of comments coming from

493.08 --> 502.34
Ballers about Rob skiba yeah dude

496.979 --> 502.34
somebody just posted in Skype

504.479 --> 510.25899999999996
Elijah noticed the news article in New

507.3 --> 510.259
York Daily News

510.3 --> 514.219
well let me just show you

529.58 --> 533.5400000000001
that's way too small

533.94 --> 538.6400000000001
anyway maybe you'll be able to make it

536.459 --> 538.64
out

540.839 --> 545.12
right

542.339 --> 549.5400000000001
Flat Earth

545.12 --> 552.6
Advocate anti-vaxxer dies of covet

549.54 --> 555.3
report yeah yeah

552.6 --> 559.279
oh that was totally to be expected

555.3 --> 559.279
Yahoo news doing the same

564.66 --> 569.04
was all on YouTube okay well Gadget

567.24 --> 571.339
inspector yeah that's three and a half

569.04 --> 571.3389999999999
hours

571.86 --> 577.22
not exactly an all-nighter but I get

574.44 --> 577.22
your gist

579.36 --> 585.3000000000001
he died

581.58 --> 586.38
well I think I have no evidence of this

585.3 --> 589.0999999999999
directly

586.38 --> 594.38
there's a lot of indications

589.1 --> 594.38
hints that he died of the protocols

595.38 --> 600.98
it's yeah even though Benjamin basically

598.32 --> 600.98
addressed this

602.579 --> 607.88
like didn't expect him to do that but he

605.64 --> 607.88
did

612.959 --> 615.959
foreign

621.86 --> 627.66
and what happens when you die of the

624.72 --> 630.24
protocols you get registered as a covet

627.66 --> 632.6999999999999
death and then the hospital

630.24 --> 635.88
gets a lot of money from that

632.7 --> 637.0790000000001
it's an unfortunate dark reality right

635.88 --> 641.24
now

637.079 --> 641.2399999999999
ventilator problem you think

642.959 --> 647.5189999999999
yeah that protocol

644.88 --> 649.519
is designed to do that it's not designed

647.519 --> 653.519
to be

649.519 --> 653.519
restorative restorative

657.72 --> 664.38
guessing game no no it's not a guessing

660.839 --> 667.5600000000001
game only absolutely not the data

664.38 --> 670.4399999999999
was already handed to us and even when

667.56 --> 673.4399999999999
that I first heard that I immediately

670.44 --> 675.7790000000001
kind of silently rang the alarm because

673.44 --> 679.019
what can I do about it except just point

675.779 --> 681.3
it out like this seems very suspicious

679.019 --> 683.1
it seems like he's rolling into these

681.3 --> 686.579
typical protocols

683.1 --> 691.22
it's very risky you should

686.579 --> 691.2199999999999
like doesn't his family know

696.42 --> 703.1999999999999
where did the data come from well

700.38 --> 705.8
from the people informing us that he was

703.2 --> 705.8000000000001
in the hospital

706.62 --> 711.0
right

708.72 --> 713.1
the data is all there what happened to

711.0 --> 715.62
him how he

713.1 --> 718.26
got into the hospital and then what his

715.62 --> 724.16
state was like oh being kept in an

718.26 --> 724.16
artificial coma oh sounds familiar

726.6 --> 731.639
so he he probably

728.88 --> 735.36
well I just I want to know

731.639 --> 738.899
did they give him REM deserver

735.36 --> 741.54
you know that's a bit of data that I

738.899 --> 745.26
haven't gotten yet but did they put him

741.54 --> 748.139
on that because then the deal is sealed

745.26 --> 753.3
then it's a protocol death

748.139 --> 756.9590000000001
he's become victim of DC protocols the

753.3 --> 760.279
hospital protocols the hostile

756.959 --> 760.279
death protocols

768.0 --> 772.279
yeah nobody dies of covet nobody

786.48 --> 788.72
foreign

798.2 --> 803.94
I'm just surprised that

800.94 --> 805.139
it all happened the way it did

803.94 --> 808.139
like

805.139 --> 810.779
come on man rob should have known better

808.139 --> 813.779
I don't know what was going on in him

810.779 --> 816.24
that he went for that move in this

813.779 --> 818.639
current environment like he should have

816.24 --> 820.0790000000001
known better that is the most surprising

818.639 --> 822.54
part

820.079 --> 824.9399999999999
get the feeling like he really panicked

822.54 --> 826.26
and lost it for some reason like serious

824.94 --> 830.1
weakness

826.26 --> 832.3389999999999
right and yeah in his age that leads to

830.1 --> 832.339
death

834.899 --> 840.3
like serious collapse weakness of

837.36 --> 842.519
judgment yeah that leads to death

840.3 --> 845.0999999999999
right now if you're gonna panic and

842.519 --> 847.62
gonna like oh I have to I'm just going

845.1 --> 851.639
to believe like hospitals were the way

847.62 --> 851.639
that they should be yeah

851.94 --> 858.6
good luck with that probably not gonna

855.42 --> 860.279
work out as you thought it did would

858.6 --> 864.72
so

860.279 --> 867.12
but yeah I don't want to like you dude

864.72 --> 869.1
no no he was trying to hammer that out

867.12 --> 871.519
you know he literally paid for it with

869.1 --> 871.519
his life

872.699 --> 878.3389999999999
I just think it's such a waste

876.3 --> 880.4399999999999
like I don't understand how it could

878.339 --> 883.0790000000001
have come to that

880.44 --> 886.0790000000001
that's my that's the mystery that I'm

883.079 --> 887.6389999999999
like having about it like I don't know I

886.079 --> 890.0
don't know how how could this have

887.639 --> 890.0
happened

895.68 --> 898.76
coughed on blood

898.8 --> 904.279
right well yeah coughing up blood will

900.66 --> 904.279
make somebody Panic for sure

904.68 --> 907.399
but

914.639 --> 919.639
there would have been so many other

916.74 --> 919.639
things he could have done

925.92 --> 931.579
a little Moon Shadow

928.199 --> 931.579
moon buggy

949.98 --> 955.019
you fell ill during the conference

952.86 --> 956.6990000000001
uh yeah

955.019 --> 958.98
well hey

956.699 --> 961.92
that's called stress

958.98 --> 963.0600000000001
you know Rob's keeper was a sensitive

961.92 --> 965.579
guy

963.06 --> 967.9799999999999
kind of like myself remember when I went

965.579 --> 970.8
to the Amsterdam conference

967.98 --> 973.62
the the pressure especially for somebody

970.8 --> 975.7199999999999
like me who is not that I'm like really

973.62 --> 977.22
isolated

975.72 --> 980.339
if you're not used to it it's very

977.22 --> 981.899
stressful and I literally predicted I am

980.339 --> 984.0600000000001
going to be sick

981.899 --> 986.579
because I know myself I know how this

984.06 --> 989.399
works and yeah guess what happened I did

986.579 --> 991.8599999999999
become sick very much so

989.399 --> 996.38
but that's predictable

991.86 --> 996.38
it's stress induced

996.959 --> 1002.5999999999999
that's not like oh I suddenly got

999.42 --> 1006.019
something my system is weak I got

1002.6 --> 1008.839
something no it's just oh stress piling

1006.019 --> 1011.42
on the weight you have to maneuver in

1008.839 --> 1013.2790000000001
unusual ways that you're not

1011.42 --> 1015.8
where you can be less of yourself you

1013.279 --> 1017.42
have to like uphold sort of your

1015.8 --> 1019.579
narrative your thing you have to

1017.42 --> 1021.74
represent yeah that's very stressful

1019.579 --> 1024.6789999999999
when you're surrounded by people that

1021.74 --> 1025.64
are pretty close to your Regional

1024.679 --> 1027.919
knowledge

1025.64 --> 1030.8600000000001
it's a lot of pressure

1027.919 --> 1033.5200000000002
you get sick from that especially if

1030.86 --> 1033.52
you're sensitive

1033.86 --> 1039.1
that's normal in my experience

1041.98 --> 1047.539
right and he was wearing the freaking

1044.539 --> 1050.179
masks yeah that's if that compounds the

1047.539 --> 1052.76
problem even more right that actually

1050.179 --> 1055.8200000000002
really then burdens the lungs

1052.76 --> 1058.34
right if you're already kind of having

1055.82 --> 1060.3799999999999
pressure from stress that strains the

1058.34 --> 1063.26
entire body if you then have some other

1060.38 --> 1065.3600000000001
thing that burdens a part of it for your

1063.26 --> 1068.44
body even more yeah

1065.36 --> 1068.4399999999998
that's not good

1071.299 --> 1073.72
right

1077.299 --> 1083.32
yes I understand America silver Patriot

1079.7 --> 1083.32
yeah he was a

1085.22 --> 1089.72
yeah like a good priest

1088.16 --> 1092.539
I think

1089.72 --> 1095.799
when it yeah concerning priest and I

1092.539 --> 1095.799
thought he was pretty decent

1097.52 --> 1101.84
and I liked how he was in many ways

1100.4 --> 1105.94
eclectic

1101.84 --> 1105.9399999999998
even if it's just in a minor way

1116.48 --> 1123.28
my wedding day was the sickest I've ever

1118.82 --> 1123.28
been yeah Luna loves you that yeah

1123.32 --> 1126.52
that happens a lot

1126.679 --> 1131.24
wedding days are like

1128.96 --> 1133.7
in your mind it's all glorious but when

1131.24 --> 1136.52
you act actually do it it tends to be

1133.7 --> 1138.98
really stressful it's more it's almost

1136.52 --> 1140.84
more like a stress test

1138.98 --> 1143.1200000000001
it really is

1140.84 --> 1145.9399999999998
it's like

1143.12 --> 1148.34
what's gonna happen when you put the two

1145.94 --> 1152.179
together when they're like

1148.34 --> 1155.1789999999999
well they should be at the closest

1152.179 --> 1158.419
art wise feeling wise to each other they

1155.179 --> 1160.22
will ever be maybe and then let's put

1158.419 --> 1161.6000000000001
them on their all that strain and

1160.22 --> 1164.6000000000001
confront them

1161.6 --> 1168.62
it's like a test it's a stress test

1164.6 --> 1170.48
like two kind of for the close ones to

1168.62 --> 1172.34
test like how are they

1170.48 --> 1174.08
gonna do when they're under pressure

1172.34 --> 1177.82
together

1174.08 --> 1177.82
see interesting isn't it

1186.2 --> 1190.8400000000001
can't remember wedding day got hammered

1188.48 --> 1190.84
okay

1206.02 --> 1209.099
[Music]

1215.6 --> 1220.48
hey Tony Whitcomb

1217.82 --> 1220.48
yeah

1225.08 --> 1231.6789999999999
but Tony with in this case

1227.78 --> 1235.039
it's just good to point out that how it

1231.679 --> 1237.2
happened right he was wearing a mask he

1235.039 --> 1239.059
was getting in the middle of a high

1237.2 --> 1243.38
attention

1239.059 --> 1245.4189999999999
socially stressful situation

1243.38 --> 1248.0
you know even in a positive way it's

1245.419 --> 1249.5
still stressful

1248.0 --> 1253.46
and then

1249.5 --> 1257.32
sick and here comes the key he panicked

1253.46 --> 1257.32
he panicked and went for a hospital

1260.419 --> 1265.8200000000002
if that hadn't had hadn't happened

1263.539 --> 1267.08
he would have just basically retreated

1265.82 --> 1272.6589999999999
for a bit

1267.08 --> 1275.48
took it easy took take I take things and

1272.659 --> 1276.8600000000001
vow never to put a damn mask on ever

1275.48 --> 1279.02
again

1276.86 --> 1283.58
I think he would have probably just

1279.02 --> 1287.0
fully recovered or at least survived it

1283.58 --> 1289.12
right but yeah that's oh hindsight of

1287.0 --> 1289.12
course

1298.72 --> 1305.32
oh clutch that sounds amazing

1302.659 --> 1305.3200000000002
wow

1313.22 --> 1315.4
foreign

1317.24 --> 1320.299
[Music]

1326.0 --> 1331.96
a guy in work told me symptoms of his

1329.0 --> 1335.179
daughter and I said she had the flu then

1331.96 --> 1336.559
he stormed off because you didn't say he

1335.179 --> 1339.7
had coveted

1336.559 --> 1339.7
started squirting

1340.28 --> 1345.799
oh that's that's funny and terrible at

1343.039 --> 1349.6589999999999
the same time but I get it hey Robert

1345.799 --> 1349.6589999999999
Bates rmp changed your name again

1353.0 --> 1357.22
that is kind of like your real name

1374.539 --> 1379.76
right but yeah Tony Whitcomb that sounds

1377.179 --> 1382.94
pretty gamma that's like a guy coming

1379.76 --> 1384.98
off like oh my daughter oh covet oh and

1382.94 --> 1386.539
then he just wanted to see you squirt

1384.98 --> 1388.58
over that probably

1386.539 --> 1391.36
really

1388.58 --> 1391.36
ugh

1396.08 --> 1401.059
at least Rhonda cured the flu

1398.36 --> 1405.1589999999999
[Music]

1401.059 --> 1405.1589999999999
yeah I'm a clutch but at what cost

1427.88 --> 1430.1200000000001
foreign

1469.94 --> 1477.039
comments from the Ballers were sick well

1472.88 --> 1477.0390000000002
it's you know at this point like

1477.38 --> 1483.2600000000002
when people behave like that should they

1479.779 --> 1485.659
even be called Ballers or just nasty

1483.26 --> 1488.179
nasty gammas

1485.659 --> 1490.4
that also happen to be Ballers right

1488.179 --> 1493.039
because

1490.4 --> 1497.8400000000001
you can't really attribute

1493.039 --> 1500.059
like what I think you're talking about

1497.84 --> 1502.6399999999999
like making fun of somebody dying and

1500.059 --> 1505.12
all that that's not standard baller

1502.64 --> 1505.1200000000001
Behavior

1507.32 --> 1512.4189999999999
right

1508.7 --> 1515.0800000000002
that's just nasty ass troll gamma

1512.419 --> 1515.0800000000002
Behavior

1518.9 --> 1523.22
right has very little to do with the

1521.659 --> 1526.1000000000001
philosophical

1523.22 --> 1529.6000000000001
difference that we have

1526.1 --> 1532.9399999999998
between Flat Earth and globe

1529.6 --> 1536.24
anti-flat earthers perhaps

1532.94 --> 1538.9
but even they they're just religious

1536.24 --> 1538.9
fanatics

1541.64 --> 1544.24
all right

1545.72 --> 1551.1200000000001
I mean I know plenty of anti-flat

1548.659 --> 1555.14
earthers that would never go there they

1551.12 --> 1557.9599999999998
would at least have that level of common

1555.14 --> 1560.6000000000001
decency left you know they've sacrificed

1557.96 --> 1563.32
already so much of their dignity they

1560.6 --> 1563.32
wouldn't go there

1565.46 --> 1570.98
right and that's why I'd like to

1568.039 --> 1574.46
separate that sort of nasty behavior

1570.98 --> 1576.98
from any philosophy because it's just

1574.46 --> 1579.8600000000001
nastiness

1576.98 --> 1583.24
right it's nasty behavior and whatever

1579.86 --> 1585.9189999999999
side such a person is on in any argument

1583.24 --> 1589.0
becomes kind of irrelevant at that point

1585.919 --> 1589.0
in my opinion

1605.24 --> 1610.179
all Gammas are called Ray now what

1611.779 --> 1614.779
why

1615.14 --> 1617.7990000000002
uh

1640.1 --> 1644.539
right

1641.779 --> 1647.24
well if I do remember correctly robsky

1644.539 --> 1650.12
but did have like a whole bunch of

1647.24 --> 1654.82
very nasty trolls that I would suspect

1650.12 --> 1654.82
are principled satanists and all that

1655.159 --> 1662.659
like he's had some really nasty people

1658.419 --> 1664.5800000000002
or kind of stalking him I think if I

1662.659 --> 1666.7990000000002
remember correctly

1664.58 --> 1670.039
because he has mentioned that here and

1666.799 --> 1672.76
there very scarcely

1670.039 --> 1672.76
so

1673.7 --> 1680.779
right because he was so dedicated to

1677.299 --> 1683.12
that that side the Christian element and

1680.779 --> 1686.32
they really

1683.12 --> 1686.32
like it might

1691.039 --> 1697.039
like it could have even been like a

1693.38 --> 1699.0800000000002
really bad flat earthers

1697.039 --> 1701.12
I know that's kind of like throwing a

1699.08 --> 1703.9399999999998
bowling ball through that glass window I

1701.12 --> 1705.26
know but because there is like really

1703.94 --> 1709.46
nasty

1705.26 --> 1712.94
satanic types out there that also have

1709.46 --> 1715.58
nestled within Flat Earth

1712.94 --> 1718.3400000000001
well for them it's very easy to just

1715.58 --> 1722.26
make a sock account pretend to be a

1718.34 --> 1722.26
baller and then start attacking him

1724.159 --> 1728.1200000000001
right

1725.419 --> 1730.039
because they're especially like in 2016

1728.12 --> 1734.059
there was this whole

1730.039 --> 1736.22
Schism going on this split up

1734.059 --> 1738.2
where the Flat Earth there was some

1736.22 --> 1741.38
group of flat earthers

1738.2 --> 1743.539
the fresh batch we're like no we have to

1741.38 --> 1745.7600000000002
keep Christianity out of the Flat Earth

1743.539 --> 1748.34
and then there was the other side that

1745.76 --> 1752.539
was like no no

1748.34 --> 1756.26
Flat Earth is biblical and and they

1752.539 --> 1759.3799999999999
really didn't like each other right well

1756.26 --> 1763.58
you can already guess Rob skiba was on

1759.38 --> 1767.779
the the Christian side and he got like a

1763.58 --> 1770.3799999999999
hammered also on social media over that

1767.779 --> 1770.38
so

1776.48 --> 1779.779
they're indeed Chelsea a lot of bad

1778.64 --> 1783.0200000000002
comments

1779.779 --> 1786.38
Gadget well I don't know Gadget

1783.02 --> 1790.059
inspector does ranty even keep track

1786.38 --> 1790.0590000000002
of his comment section

1790.7 --> 1795.799
I mean I I am barely able to keep track

1793.94 --> 1798.0800000000002
of it because

1795.799 --> 1801.22
sometimes I get absolutely nothing and

1798.08 --> 1804.86
then afterward all of a sudden like

1801.22 --> 1809.799
dozens of comments pop up

1804.86 --> 1809.799
often lots of troll comments too right

1830.84 --> 1836.0
yes Robert Bates rmp

1833.539 --> 1837.86
if an anti-flare disgraces a disease

1836.0 --> 1839.659
first well it wouldn't even have to be

1837.86 --> 1842.84
an anti-flat earther

1839.659 --> 1845.48
like if anybody does that in my physical

1842.84 --> 1847.399
presence I will be severely pissed off

1845.48 --> 1850.52
and I will let them know I will not

1847.399 --> 1853.279
resort to violence but I will definitely

1850.52 --> 1855.86
shock snap them out of it

1853.279 --> 1858.32
might even like grab their shoulders and

1855.86 --> 1859.58
like hello hello something like that

1858.32 --> 1862.76
right

1859.58 --> 1865.6999999999998
or at least like talk very harshly to

1862.76 --> 1866.48
them like that's very indecent thing to

1865.7 --> 1867.98
say

1866.48 --> 1869.84
doesn't matter to me if they're an

1867.98 --> 1872.0
anti-flat earther or whatever their

1869.84 --> 1875.059
philosophy is if you do that in general

1872.0 --> 1878.059
it's bad

1875.059 --> 1880.279
that's ariman

1878.059 --> 1883.48
taking control

1880.279 --> 1883.48
and you letting him

1888.26 --> 1895.1589999999999
right kick him when they're down that's

1891.159 --> 1895.159
ariman nasty

1902.08 --> 1905.62
Randy's channels

1906.44 --> 1909.3200000000002
right I don't keep track of what he's

1908.24 --> 1911.36
doing man

1909.32 --> 1914.36
is he still like on the spooky ghost

1911.36 --> 1916.6399999999999
thing with cats I have no idea what he's

1914.36 --> 1918.9399999999998
up to these days I don't really care

1916.64 --> 1918.94
anyway

1928.399 --> 1933.1589999999999
Sean Hawkins had to say what did he say

1937.1 --> 1944.9599999999998
the globalist got schema

1942.32 --> 1948.399
what

1944.96 --> 1948.3990000000001
flatten the Earth what

1956.6 --> 1960.6789999999999
he is a full-time troller now really so

1959.24 --> 1963.14
he doesn't even do the spooky ghost

1960.679 --> 1966.5
thing anymore how disappointing there is

1963.14 --> 1969.74
so much spooky ghosts yet to talk about

1966.5 --> 1972.88
I guess to make any sense of it you just

1969.74 --> 1975.7
have to not be a [ __ ] not be totally

1972.88 --> 1979.519
desensitized atheistic

1975.7 --> 1981.26
no pay no attention to anything subtle

1979.519 --> 1984.14
dick

1981.26 --> 1986.059
and then you'd probably do a good job

1984.14 --> 1987.919
because there are lots of spooky ghost

1986.059 --> 1991.279
thingies out there that are very

1987.919 --> 1993.7990000000002
interesting to ponder upon but it's just

1991.279 --> 1996.019
not very good at it I guess

1993.799 --> 1998.6
because he really doesn't care he just

1996.019 --> 2000.58
does it for the attempt to grab the

1998.6 --> 2003.9599999999998
attention

2000.58 --> 2003.96
am I anywhere close

2006.1 --> 2010.6
only does Fitz trying to call oh God

2008.799 --> 2013.779
really

2010.6 --> 2014.9189999999999
so he's really becoming an anti-flat

2013.779 --> 2017.32
earther then

2014.919 --> 2020.22
that's

2017.32 --> 2020.22
uh

2024.279 --> 2029.58
oh okay

2026.32 --> 2029.58
flatten the curve yeah yeah

2034.899 --> 2038.6999999999998
all right well

2036.64 --> 2041.74
that's uh

2038.7 --> 2042.64
that's like an Alex Jones way of saying

2041.74 --> 2045.58
it

2042.64 --> 2048.76
right it's the globalist agenda to kill

2045.58 --> 2050.919
people from the fake pandemic right

2048.76 --> 2053.5
in this case I'd say yeah these are

2050.919 --> 2056.04
medical protocols that have been

2053.5 --> 2058.379
maneuvered into the medical system

2056.04 --> 2062.079
through a

2058.379 --> 2066.399
financier based conspiracy in

2062.079 --> 2066.3990000000003
conjunction with government cooperation

2067.599 --> 2074.8790000000004
and it is thought up by the Marxist

2072.7 --> 2079.06
communist globalist

2074.879 --> 2080.74
Neo Elite wannabe Neo feudalists

2079.06 --> 2084.359
right

2080.74 --> 2084.359
if we want to get really specific

2090.52 --> 2095.5
you think ghosts are real well that

2093.22 --> 2096.7599999999998
depends on what you think ghosts are

2095.5 --> 2099.94
clutch

2096.76 --> 2101.579
yes absolutely I have dude

2099.94 --> 2106.119
I've had

2101.579 --> 2106.119
significant ghost experiences

2107.38 --> 2113.02
and when I mentioned that I mean not in

2110.92 --> 2117.7000000000003
the dark world that's that's the funny

2113.02 --> 2122.14
part in the Dark World no no way

2117.7 --> 2125.74
in the physical time-based world yes yes

2122.14 --> 2127.839
I have and I had a whole period

2125.74 --> 2130.359
for roughly five years where I was

2127.839 --> 2134.32
actively seeking them out because I was

2130.359 --> 2137.02
testing it I would be interested like oh

2134.32 --> 2140.02
oh you have weird spooky things in your

2137.02 --> 2142.18
house it's haunted or something oh I'll

2140.02 --> 2144.04
check it out and I might clean it up I

2142.18 --> 2148.4199999999996
might unravel what's happened there like

2144.04 --> 2151.0
I was that guy I went to houses

2148.42 --> 2153.4
not getting paid for it out of pure

2151.0 --> 2154.96
curiosity but I did that

2153.4 --> 2158.7400000000002
because I could

2154.96 --> 2161.859
and I would unravel what's this energy

2158.74 --> 2163.5989999999997
is this an echo is is there like an

2161.859 --> 2165.64
unsolved

2163.599 --> 2167.8
sin

2165.64 --> 2169.72
lingering

2167.8 --> 2171.82
like what is this

2169.72 --> 2175.2999999999997
and I went to like graveyard old

2171.82 --> 2178.3590000000004
graveyards too with old churches

2175.3 --> 2181.26
and I have seen actual specters like

2178.359 --> 2181.2599999999998
white veils

2181.359 --> 2189.7
and to top that off when my mother died

2185.56 --> 2191.68
I saw her as a ghost approaching me and

2189.7 --> 2194.56
that was before I was officially

2191.68 --> 2198.0989999999997
informed she had passed away I literally

2194.56 --> 2200.02
saw it it came to me it interfaced me it

2198.099 --> 2202.48
like touched me

2200.02 --> 2205.48
without touching me like in

2202.48 --> 2208.9
electric or a magnetic field like

2205.48 --> 2212.28
entering that and then like

2208.9 --> 2214.6600000000003
in a sub thing in a sub experience

2212.28 --> 2217.6600000000003
interfaced with the ghost of my mother

2214.66 --> 2219.64
and saw her face as her when she was

2217.66 --> 2222.04
really young

2219.64 --> 2224.7999999999997
one of the most astounding experiences

2222.04 --> 2227.14
I've ever had that really sealed the

2224.8 --> 2229.599
deal for me

2227.14 --> 2232.7799999999997
like there's no more mistake

2229.599 --> 2236.079
these experiences are real now it's up

2232.78 --> 2240.6400000000003
to me to figure out what they are

2236.079 --> 2244.5600000000004
and I have for over 20 years let it all

2240.64 --> 2244.56
sink and integrated it

2245.079 --> 2250.5
in My overall knowledge of creation

2251.859 --> 2254.859
huh

2262.48 --> 2270.9
did I ever do a Ouija board no

2266.8 --> 2270.9
why why would I do that

2273.16 --> 2275.64
no

2280.119 --> 2285.7000000000003
I would never let like a spiritual

2283.0 --> 2288.64
entity

2285.7 --> 2291.04
take control of a device

2288.64 --> 2294.22
if I wanted to communicate with some

2291.04 --> 2295.54
entity I do it I who needs a freaking

2294.22 --> 2297.9399999999996
board

2295.54 --> 2299.74
I just like

2297.94 --> 2302.619
hi

2299.74 --> 2306.2999999999997
what are you what are you doing here is

2302.619 --> 2306.3
there something you're looking for

2317.03 --> 2321.8390000000004
[Music]

2318.82 --> 2326.4
did it once it was freaky yeah I bet

2321.839 --> 2326.4
I've met people that have done it

2326.68 --> 2332.6189999999997
I've even I think I've been present

2329.74 --> 2334.24
where it was done like during a party or

2332.619 --> 2336.94
something really stupid

2334.24 --> 2340.06
and there was like a palpable energy

2336.94 --> 2342.4
manifestation that I could feel when it

2340.06 --> 2345.16
finally hit

2342.4 --> 2346.78
when it the thing happened

2345.16 --> 2350.68
it's weird

2346.78 --> 2353.5600000000004
don't do it it's bad news

2350.68 --> 2355.96
I've never heard of a single example

2353.56 --> 2358.599
when it was used

2355.96 --> 2361.359
where there was a really positive

2358.599 --> 2365.28
outcome because of it

2361.359 --> 2365.2799999999997
very prone to getting cursed

2370.54 --> 2376.32
I don't touch Ouija boards ever

2373.48 --> 2376.32
don't need him

2378.46 --> 2384.339
but I have met people that seem to be

2382.0 --> 2386.56
able to deal with it in a very stable

2384.339 --> 2388.54
fashion

2386.56 --> 2391.66
but only because they took a lot of

2388.54 --> 2394.599
precautions and took it very serious and

2391.66 --> 2396.5789999999997
not like oh let's oh let's get spooky

2394.599 --> 2400.32
ghosty for the amusement no because

2396.579 --> 2400.32
that's how you invite trouble

2404.14 --> 2406.319
foreign

2425.339 --> 2431.2599999999998
that's freaky got you the inspector yeah

2428.8 --> 2433.2400000000002
don't do that yeah when the room gets

2431.26 --> 2436.96
cold that means

2433.24 --> 2439.8999999999996
there is a non-living spirit

2436.96 --> 2442.06
or a deceased Spirit literally entering

2439.9 --> 2445.0
electromagnetically

2442.06 --> 2447.119
that's why it get cold

2445.0 --> 2450.88
really

2447.119 --> 2454.319
like these things are like common

2450.88 --> 2457.98
knowledge now they really are it's been

2454.319 --> 2457.98
echoed to no end

2458.099 --> 2466.56
in in fiction even in stories and in

2462.16 --> 2466.56
movies like and that's not a joke

2467.079 --> 2473.5600000000004
I've experienced that too like yeah

2470.44 --> 2476.619
when things get cold that's when there's

2473.56 --> 2480.2799999999997
a manifestation and often not

2476.619 --> 2484.2400000000002
like it's lit if it's icy then there is

2480.28 --> 2487.0
something I see about the spirit

2484.24 --> 2489.3999999999996
right because if like your grandmother

2487.0 --> 2491.26
suddenly pops by and gives you like a

2489.4 --> 2492.94
blessing kiss or something that sort of

2491.26 --> 2496.38
thing happens too then it doesn't get

2492.94 --> 2496.38
cold huh

2497.02 --> 2502.48
because it's different they like ride in

2499.96 --> 2505.599
on your field because it connects

2502.48 --> 2507.64
there's an icy code that means you could

2505.599 --> 2512.46
almost interpret it as there is a

2507.64 --> 2512.46
potentially hostile entity manifesting

2515.04 --> 2521.88
that's how I see that like it for me

2518.859 --> 2521.88
it's all intuitive

2556.06 --> 2561.839
oh damn

2558.099 --> 2561.839
that sucks Latina curve

2581.619 --> 2586.599
yeah

2583.3 --> 2588.46
yeah Gage inspector and you should it

2586.599 --> 2590.76
should freak you out because it's bad

2588.46 --> 2590.76
news

2591.52 --> 2596.2
I hope

2593.26 --> 2598.119
well it's years ago you say but

2596.2 --> 2600.64
sometimes that sort of [ __ ] can leave

2598.119 --> 2603.04
lasting marks on you

2600.64 --> 2605.92
like a curse that's why I say it's very

2603.04 --> 2608.98
dangerous you can get cursed

2605.92 --> 2612.579
and that's not like oh

2608.98 --> 2616.0
no that's literally like an energy

2612.579 --> 2620.5
change a mark comes with you

2616.0 --> 2623.8
tag in spirit mechanics

2620.5 --> 2627.22
my healer would say that's literally a

2623.8 --> 2631.619
mark a mark from an entity that uses

2627.22 --> 2631.6189999999997
that Mark to basically tap into you

2632.859 --> 2636.54
the marks can be removed

2636.7 --> 2639.54
by the way

2656.2 --> 2658.3799999999997
foreign

2666.46 --> 2672.2200000000003
I think it's an interesting storytelling

2669.4 --> 2674.079
operation but it's become like

2672.22 --> 2677.6189999999997
two

2674.079 --> 2680.2000000000003
to Rococo for my style

2677.619 --> 2683.38
it's it's no longer Renaissance they

2680.2 --> 2686.4399999999996
just went in full conspiracy Rococo art

2683.38 --> 2689.079
it's ridiculous anybody that really

2686.44 --> 2691.839
follows that at this point is just

2689.079 --> 2694.2400000000002
doesn't have an oversight doesn't

2691.839 --> 2696.88
understand what Q Anon really is it's

2694.24 --> 2700.24
like an ongoing operation

2696.88 --> 2701.98
it is intelligence operation

2700.24 --> 2706.24
but

2701.98 --> 2709.42
it's not as in control as The Narrative

2706.24 --> 2710.2599999999998
of it suggests and that's part of the

2709.42 --> 2715.2000000000003
game

2710.26 --> 2715.2000000000003
it's like a LARP but like it

2716.859 --> 2720.42
it's a lot but it's real

2725.68 --> 2731.52
because

2726.88 --> 2731.52
they don't tell you that it's alarm

2739.74 --> 2743.9399999999996
no tomanoids

2742.48 --> 2749.26
dude

2743.94 --> 2753.52
why do you conjure that [ __ ] why do you

2749.26 --> 2755.0200000000004
occupy yourself to think up what more

2753.52 --> 2758.5
evil

2755.02 --> 2760.8
the evil out there can do why do you do

2758.5 --> 2760.8
that

2762.96 --> 2766.92
don't do that

2767.14 --> 2775.0
don't give them ideas

2770.38 --> 2781.02
they reap them from you and then

2775.0 --> 2781.02
actually do it don't give them ideas

2788.8 --> 2797.4
it's already going to be very bad no

2793.599 --> 2797.4
need to pile on more

2803.2 --> 2805.3799999999997
foreign

2807.46 --> 2813.16
if they haven't already straight out

2810.04 --> 2815.619
done this and they probably have

2813.16 --> 2819.66
there is a mark about the facts my

2815.619 --> 2819.6600000000003
healer distinctly mentioned it

2821.92 --> 2828.04
the mark of the beast perhaps

2825.24 --> 2830.4399999999996
metaphorically esoterically yeah very

2828.04 --> 2833.7599999999998
likely what does that mean

2830.44 --> 2833.76
that's another matter

2834.46 --> 2840.16
it's about helium puzzles

2837.4 --> 2844.079
yeah helium puddles is

2840.16 --> 2844.0789999999997
would make a great band name

2849.16 --> 2855.0989999999997
helium puddles or puddles of helium

2852.46 --> 2857.94
wouldn't you say would make a great band

2855.099 --> 2857.94
name I think

2871.24 --> 2875.4599999999996
a one for the unit let's see you

2887.74 --> 2893.9199999999996
right yeah hey next time come up

2891.16 --> 2897.0589999999997
with a non-troll account

2893.92 --> 2897.059
you want to talk to me

2900.76 --> 2904.0200000000004
why don't you represent

2904.599 --> 2909.1600000000003
I don't I don't want to answer questions

2907.0 --> 2911.92
of sock accounts right if you're gonna

2909.16 --> 2914.339
make a sock account to troll me then I

2911.92 --> 2917.92
might just for the fun of it address you

2914.339 --> 2921.2799999999997
and literally answer the question

2917.92 --> 2923.44
if it is a troll question if you want to

2921.28 --> 2925.26
seriously have a conversation with me

2923.44 --> 2928.92
and ask questions

2925.26 --> 2928.92
represent please

2930.22 --> 2935.9199999999996
I don't want to

2933.16 --> 2938.2599999999998
have to deal with sock accounts because

2935.92 --> 2940.0
people are too afraid to actually

2938.26 --> 2943.2400000000002
represent

2940.0 --> 2948.24
when they are genuinely curious

2943.24 --> 2948.24
I resent people doing that don't do that

2974.319 --> 2980.04
ah yeah that's a good point gaining

2976.18 --> 2980.04
wisdom that's my experience as well

2982.24 --> 2989.3799999999997
right it's esoteric like why do you seek

2987.04 --> 2991.9
outside when everything you need is

2989.38 --> 2994.78
inside and through the inside you

2991.9 --> 2997.9
connect with the outside

2994.78 --> 3000.5400000000004
so if you're gonna try to tap into

2997.9 --> 3002.4
another spirit that effectively means

3000.54 --> 3005.16
you are

3002.4 --> 3007.02
Escape trying to seek something outside

3005.16 --> 3008.64
of yourself

3007.02 --> 3010.8
because you're not connecting to

3008.64 --> 3013.14
yourself and that brings in all kinds of

3010.8 --> 3016.04
weird Spirit Alchemy

3013.14 --> 3016.04
really does

3034.74 --> 3039.839
Holy Spirit

3036.559 --> 3042.26
you yeah perhaps perhaps you could call

3039.839 --> 3042.2599999999998
it that

3049.68 --> 3054.839
I I don't

3051.66 --> 3056.819
like that part of me when I do Spirit

3054.839 --> 3059.04
things and communicate with the spirit

3056.819 --> 3061.2599999999998
Etc I don't see that as a singular

3059.04 --> 3065.22
entity it's like

3061.26 --> 3067.1400000000003
I just interface with the weave like all

3065.22 --> 3070.2599999999998
the spirits

3067.14 --> 3071.94
and it's just like how they're arranged

3070.26 --> 3074.3390000000004
it

3071.94 --> 3078.319
I I just don't really see it as a

3074.339 --> 3078.319
singular entity I just don't

3082.68 --> 3087.68
like saying you're less than yes yes you

3085.2 --> 3087.68
get the point

3091.859 --> 3097.14
right yeah Cleary like where's the

3094.92 --> 3099.059
puddles of helium account

3097.14 --> 3102.3799999999997
why hasn't somebody called themselves

3099.059 --> 3102.38
puddles of helium yet

3102.839 --> 3109.5789999999997
it would make a great name for an uh for

3105.359 --> 3109.5789999999997
a YouTube account if you ask me

3116.04 --> 3122.3
I have used the phrase get behind me

3118.44 --> 3122.3
Satan when faced with bad energy

3122.46 --> 3127.98
all right

3124.26 --> 3130.8190000000004
I never did that like that

3127.98 --> 3130.819
I just

3132.66 --> 3137.819
I don't know

3134.339 --> 3140.4
I don't address it I just invoke Christ

3137.819 --> 3141.72
I just do my

3140.4 --> 3146.1800000000003
my little

3141.72 --> 3146.18
personal prayer thing

3149.46 --> 3153.68
like Jesus Christ keep me on the

3151.559 --> 3156.78
straight path

3153.68 --> 3159.14
Archangel Michael protect me from the

3156.78 --> 3159.1400000000003
darkness

3159.18 --> 3163.98
Archangel Raphael keep my heart in the

3162.72 --> 3167.52
right place

3163.98 --> 3169.8
and there's a lot of visual things that

3167.52 --> 3172.079
accompany saying that for me

3169.8 --> 3176.1600000000003
and not that oh I need to see it now

3172.079 --> 3180.079
that's all in my virtual space

3176.16 --> 3180.0789999999997
and that works for me

3180.48 --> 3187.76
I never addressed the darkness I used to

3183.42 --> 3187.76
it's counterproductive in my opinion

3187.8 --> 3193.559
I mean you could do it but it's like

3190.68 --> 3195.839
troll baiting right dark Spirits are

3193.559 --> 3198.059
just like trolls if you actually poke

3195.839 --> 3201.319
them they just like oh oh so you

3198.059 --> 3201.3190000000004
recognize I exist

3201.839 --> 3208.02
you close the loop for them which kind

3205.38 --> 3211.859
of makes them manifest

3208.02 --> 3214.74
by addressing them anyway it doesn't

3211.859 --> 3216.66
really matter it's just a little

3214.74 --> 3219.839
esoteric detail

3216.66 --> 3223.7599999999998
if get behind me Satan works for you

3219.839 --> 3223.7599999999998
then it works right

3237.559 --> 3242.1800000000003
oh talking about a real human

3242.7 --> 3247.4399999999996
that's interesting

3245.46 --> 3250.619
I thought you were talking about the

3247.44 --> 3250.619
Spirit uh

3253.319 --> 3257.64
no that's not my tactic but then again I

3256.14 --> 3261.3799999999997
am a man

3257.64 --> 3261.3799999999997
I have a very different tactic

3264.3 --> 3271.619
I have like fearlessness right the true

3268.68 --> 3274.3799999999997
fearlessness where I am basically

3271.619 --> 3276.9
it's weird it's kind of the same thing I

3274.38 --> 3278.76
do with trolls sometimes except I've

3276.9 --> 3283.44
done that with people that had hostile

3278.76 --> 3286.92
intentions toward me worked really well

3283.44 --> 3289.859
right it's it's resting on the principle

3286.92 --> 3292.079
that hatred is unanswered love

3289.859 --> 3294.359
so if somebody is in the position where

3292.079 --> 3296.819
they feel the need to attack somebody

3294.359 --> 3298.5
especially if they're sensitive that

3296.819 --> 3301.04
means that they're actually looking for

3298.5 --> 3301.04
healing

3301.68 --> 3308.819
right so what I sometimes do very

3305.22 --> 3310.3799999999997
impromptu is somebody with hostile

3308.819 --> 3312.24
intentions towards me and I'm talking

3310.38 --> 3314.94
about physical real life situation I got

3312.24 --> 3318.299
pretty decent at this during my teens I

3314.94 --> 3320.579
did not during pre-teens and I suffered

3318.299 --> 3322.44
greatly for my inability to deal with

3320.579 --> 3324.6600000000003
those situation but in my teens I

3322.44 --> 3328.14
learned this

3324.66 --> 3330.0
you attack them with love

3328.14 --> 3334.0789999999997
like real

3330.0 --> 3337.799
it's like almost like Christian Magic

3334.079 --> 3340.26
it's it's very great Jesus Christ

3337.799 --> 3342.96
to do that and it works if you know what

3340.26 --> 3345.6600000000003
you're doing if you can actually connect

3342.96 --> 3348.299
with the one that's hostile to you and

3345.66 --> 3350.94
you don't polarize against them

3348.299 --> 3353.16
you can just figure out what bothers

3350.94 --> 3355.44
them and then give them what they need

3353.16 --> 3359.52
what they really needed

3355.44 --> 3363.119
and then if you do they just lose the

3359.52 --> 3366.119
will to be hostile and often they even

3363.119 --> 3369.5
gain as unexpected respect

3366.119 --> 3369.5
it works really great

3369.78 --> 3375.42
I've avoided so many fights that way

3373.559 --> 3377.2200000000003
it's unbelievable like even when

3375.42 --> 3379.7400000000002
somebody would just hit me in the face

3377.22 --> 3382.5
and that has happened

3379.74 --> 3384.66
I'd just be like hey what are you doing

3382.5 --> 3387.0
are you sure

3384.66 --> 3389.64
and they'd like be shocked that I just

3387.0 --> 3392.88
didn't was not phased it was not hot

3389.64 --> 3394.799
hostile was not but her it was nothing I

3392.88 --> 3397.26
would literally ignore them almost like

3394.799 --> 3399.54
I was their father

3397.26 --> 3402.5400000000004
right because a father

3399.54 --> 3405.119
I can imagine like if if their kid is

3402.54 --> 3407.2799999999997
like super frustrated then they might

3405.119 --> 3409.44
even like attack their father like I

3407.28 --> 3412.2000000000003
hate you Dad or whatever and then punch

3409.44 --> 3414.599
him and [ __ ] that they really love their

3412.2 --> 3416.7
kid would just let them do that

3414.599 --> 3419.04
I take that

3416.7 --> 3422.64
principle

3419.04 --> 3424.079
right attack them with love they don't

3422.64 --> 3425.7599999999998
expect it

3424.079 --> 3429.619
but they need it

3425.76 --> 3429.619
it's probably what they needed all along

3430.44 --> 3433.44
foreign

3439.51 --> 3442.6690000000003
[Music]

3445.74 --> 3451.68
and if they're big it's even easier

3449.46 --> 3454.319
that's the funny thing about it doing

3451.68 --> 3456.48
what I just described to people that are

3454.319 --> 3461.24
smaller than me doesn't tend to work

3456.48 --> 3461.2400000000002
when they're bigger it works really well

3468.359 --> 3473.66
I've never gotten beaten up by a guy

3470.76 --> 3473.6600000000003
bigger than me ever

3482.7 --> 3486.8999999999996
figure they are the harder they fall

3484.38 --> 3488.46
yeah or you could just make peace with

3486.9 --> 3490.92
the Giants

3488.46 --> 3493.7400000000002
and recognize they're different and

3490.92 --> 3495.66
really serve a function social as well

3493.74 --> 3498.2599999999998
as labor

3495.66 --> 3498.2599999999998
right

3498.96 --> 3503.94
if you're a small little Grappler then

3501.48 --> 3506.94
you know you need the big guys

3503.94 --> 3508.92
it's just that they make you squirt

3506.94 --> 3510.9
because yeah

3508.92 --> 3513.66
you can just like oh if they're so big

3510.9 --> 3517.26
then how big must their schlong wheel

3513.66 --> 3519.359
right that sort of [ __ ] happens

3517.26 --> 3523.46
oh Benjamin reminds us about that

3519.359 --> 3523.46
regularly oh that works

3524.819 --> 3531.48
but no I have nothing against you I want

3527.339 --> 3535.88
giant spec I want people to become huge

3531.48 --> 3540.68
I want 20 meter 20 meter tall people

3535.88 --> 3540.6800000000003
back in the realm I want them back

3540.72 --> 3544.04
they were taken from us

3577.74 --> 3583.3799999999997
Jesus keeps me keep me off the curved

3581.22 --> 3585.0
path well that's weird that's a weird

3583.38 --> 3588.799
way to say it clearly though because

3585.0 --> 3588.799
then you invoke a negative

3589.619 --> 3595.799
why do you care of why why are you

3592.68 --> 3597.5989999999997
Conjuring a curved path and then asking

3595.799 --> 3600.18
to stay off it

3597.599 --> 3602.4
wouldn't you just wouldn't it be more

3600.18 --> 3605.7599999999998
effective to actually focus on the path

3602.4 --> 3607.92
you want to be focused on that you want

3605.76 --> 3611.3390000000004
to manifest right

3607.92 --> 3613.02
don't invoke a negative invoke the

3611.339 --> 3615.859
positive

3613.02 --> 3618.599
right words details it matters

3615.859 --> 3621.48
especially when you when you're talking

3618.599 --> 3623.7000000000003
about really intense

3621.48 --> 3627.0
spiritually sensitive chance for

3623.7 --> 3629.64
yourself like every detail matters every

3627.0 --> 3633.18
detail matters

3629.64 --> 3634.92
it is like spellcraft it is like magic

3633.18 --> 3637.98
you have to say the right magic words

3634.92 --> 3640.26
yeah you do

3637.98 --> 3643.859
and we do

3640.26 --> 3648.1800000000003
and the more you learn how to how to

3643.859 --> 3650.4
avoid traps the more effective your

3648.18 --> 3652.799
words will become even in spiritual

3650.4 --> 3656.28
matters this works

3652.799 --> 3660.799
right words matters

3656.28 --> 3660.799
to be careful with the spell craft

3661.14 --> 3667.68
with the spelling with how you say it

3663.24 --> 3667.68
how you designate things matters

3682.26 --> 3687.559
right and by the way who even says there

3684.599 --> 3687.559
is a curved path

3692.299 --> 3697.98
usually when you go off the straight

3694.68 --> 3699.0589999999997
path you just end up in the jungle

3697.98 --> 3700.92
right

3699.059 --> 3702.9
there's no path

3700.92 --> 3705.42
that's the issue

3702.9 --> 3708.839
the only way to

3705.42 --> 3712.14
provide getting lost getting stuck on

3708.839 --> 3713.64
the journey is by following the path the

3712.14 --> 3717.2599999999998
straight and narrow one

3713.64 --> 3717.2599999999998
because there is no other path

3717.42 --> 3720.619
you just get stuck

3727.98 --> 3732.66
okay that's funny way to say it gaining

3730.44 --> 3736.02
wisdom deviation from straight ends in

3732.66 --> 3738.1189999999997
finite curve Circle yeah right well you

3736.02 --> 3740.88
could walk in circles or you get lost in

3738.119 --> 3743.839
the forest however you want to describe

3740.88 --> 3743.839
that but yes

3757.559 --> 3765.7400000000002
oh wow our time is flying

3762.119 --> 3765.7400000000002
I did start very late today

3775.74 --> 3781.0789999999997
wow we are talking about which let's

3778.02 --> 3785.64
talk really mystical let's really talk

3781.079 --> 3787.92
spiritual mystical maybe sci-fi even

3785.64 --> 3790.3799999999997
now I'm imagining that like yeah you

3787.92 --> 3793.44
walk the straight path and if you're not

3790.38 --> 3797.339
pure you are going to Loop

3793.44 --> 3799.44
right now imagine that you could be so

3797.339 --> 3802.319
focused so

3799.44 --> 3804.66
pure and this is already like I I don't

3802.319 --> 3805.44
even know what like what that would be

3804.66 --> 3808.2599999999998
like

3805.44 --> 3812.2200000000003
you say like oh you truly mastered the

3808.26 --> 3813.48
Jesus way and then you just walk through

3812.22 --> 3817.16
the loop

3813.48 --> 3817.16
into another Realm

3817.38 --> 3822.6600000000003
and two people that are still back in

3820.68 --> 3825.72
our realm they would just it would look

3822.66 --> 3826.44
like you were just fading away all of a

3825.72 --> 3828.9599999999996
sudden

3826.44 --> 3832.98
you just went through the loop where

3828.96 --> 3835.38
normally it Loops to well the other side

3832.98 --> 3837.96
of the realm which is the same side and

3835.38 --> 3840.119
that's yeah you loop back in

3837.96 --> 3841.92
but that you could walk through the loop

3840.119 --> 3844.92
into another Realm

3841.92 --> 3844.92
Magic

3846.599 --> 3851.94
it's a fascinating idea though

3849.9 --> 3856.28
it's like

3851.94 --> 3856.28
almost like the Wormhole effect

3857.4 --> 3863.88
except it's exactly the opposite

3860.64 --> 3866.0989999999997
hello the Adam making

3863.88 --> 3868.6800000000003
like the Wormhole would already be there

3866.099 --> 3871.619
through the loop and then you literally

3868.68 --> 3873.96
suddenly bypass it

3871.619 --> 3876.2000000000003
you go straight instead of back into the

3873.96 --> 3876.2
circle

3887.28 --> 3893.46
right maybe that is the way

3890.88 --> 3895.859
that King Arthur

3893.46 --> 3898.079
went to Avalon

3895.859 --> 3901.0789999999997
they had to be pure had to be focused

3898.079 --> 3904.02
and only then could he bypass the loop

3901.079 --> 3905.94
into the other Realm

3904.02 --> 3908.0389999999998
never considered that

3905.94 --> 3910.26
so maybe there is something to this

3908.039 --> 3911.76
conception

3910.26 --> 3914.039
Maybe

3911.76 --> 3917.099
when you go north you literally yeah

3914.039 --> 3919.26
you're like oh you go from Norway North

3917.099 --> 3922.099
and then you end up in Canada or

3919.26 --> 3922.099
something or Alaska

3923.339 --> 3932.0389999999998
right but what if you went well like

3928.38 --> 3935.28
King Arthur really spiritual pure and

3932.039 --> 3937.7400000000002
you go there and then you do end up in

3935.28 --> 3938.8190000000004
the big mountain range with the four

3937.74 --> 3941.64
rivers

3938.819 --> 3944.839
that you would you could go there but

3941.64 --> 3948.66
you'd have to be pure in order to

3944.839 --> 3951.42
transcend the loop isn't that just a

3948.66 --> 3954.359
fascinating ideas guys and there is a

3951.42 --> 3958.28
reference to the Arthurian Legend

3954.359 --> 3958.2799999999997
what if that was actually possible

3960.9 --> 3965.7000000000003
thoughts on why Elko was referred to as

3963.839 --> 3969.299
spirits in the old days well that's

3965.7 --> 3973.859
because when you are drunk you become

3969.299 --> 3975.359
very susceptible to Spirits to entities

3973.859 --> 3978.0
of all kinds

3975.359 --> 3981.359
that's and that's not in the old days my

3978.0 --> 3983.52
healer literally says that right now and

3981.359 --> 3986.2799999999997
for me it is a consideration every time

3983.52 --> 3988.559
like when I drink too much I get into

3986.28 --> 3992.3390000000004
that sort of trouble I certainly get

3988.559 --> 3994.3190000000004
taxed because I'm more open than usual

3992.339 --> 3996.66
and I'm very sensitive and like all

3994.319 --> 3999.48
these Spirits are like waiting in line

3996.66 --> 4001.7599999999998
to like trolls get to me and I don't

3999.48 --> 4003.92
even notice it because it's not like

4001.76 --> 4005.059
coming through the internet no that's

4003.92 --> 4008.1800000000003
like

4005.059 --> 4010.52
on the other side

4008.18 --> 4013.819
and then you get tagged you get marked

4010.52 --> 4016.94
because I drank too much and then it has

4013.819 --> 4020.72
to be removed again spiritually and it

4016.94 --> 4022.28
does work so yeah Spirits because you

4020.72 --> 4025.52
can't become

4022.28 --> 4027.6800000000003
possessed or marked by Spirits when you

4025.52 --> 4030.88
drink a lot like when you drink just

4027.68 --> 4034.339
very very little you maybe get tipsy Max

4030.88 --> 4036.859
yeah still a bit risky but when you

4034.339 --> 4038.24
really get drunk that's when weird [ __ ]

4036.859 --> 4040.5789999999997
starts to happen that's when people

4038.24 --> 4042.5589999999997
start blacking out that's when they hear

4040.579 --> 4045.799
the next day that they behaved really

4042.559 --> 4049.46
bizarrely for their doing right or where

4045.799 --> 4052.88
they get very grossly and decent

4049.46 --> 4055.4
that's despair that's and that's extra

4052.88 --> 4058.579
spiritual entities

4055.4 --> 4062.2400000000002
not yourself you become possessed

4058.579 --> 4064.2400000000002
because the gate is opened and nobody's

4062.24 --> 4067.3199999999997
guarding it anymore

4064.24 --> 4067.3199999999997
[Music]

4085.579 --> 4088.48
hey Crockett

4089.48 --> 4095.559
anyway decent question there and we'll

4091.579 --> 4095.559
get Omega Genesis I appreciate that

4101.189 --> 4104.789000000001
[Music]

4108.44 --> 4113.0199999999995
all right be right back two minutes

4188.779 --> 4190.96
foreign

4203.54 --> 4208.9
that's why it never became an alcoholic

4205.699 --> 4208.9
well that's very smart of you

4210.32 --> 4214.28
well for me

4211.82 --> 4217.58
I've been lucky in other ways because

4214.28 --> 4220.82
I'm like very sensitive to alcohol not

4217.58 --> 4224.42
allergic thank God but sensitive enough

4220.82 --> 4226.82
that I just don't handle it that well

4224.42 --> 4230.96
if I drink too much

4226.82 --> 4232.4
like I get sick before I get like out of

4230.96 --> 4235.1
my mind drunk

4232.4 --> 4236.659
right I I get sick before I get to that

4235.1 --> 4238.64
point

4236.659 --> 4240.86
I'm very glad of it

4238.64 --> 4244.04
because that way I don't lose my mind I

4240.86 --> 4245.719
just get sick and that sucks right so I

4244.04 --> 4247.76
want to avoid that so I don't drink too

4245.719 --> 4250.28
much

4247.76 --> 4254.12
I stick to

4250.28 --> 4257.48
yeah currently one and a half liter of

4254.12 --> 4259.82
regular organic good brand beer

4257.48 --> 4262.839999999999
not too expensive

4259.82 --> 4262.84
not too much

4263.719 --> 4271.34
and not too early it's very important

4267.14 --> 4274.1
right I've on top of the limiter seek

4271.34 --> 4276.8
out a specific time in the day

4274.1 --> 4280.84
not at night don't fall asleep with the

4276.8 --> 4280.84
alcohol also issues right

4281.42 --> 4288.92
so I'm a very careful Drinker and I'd

4285.08 --> 4291.44
like to think I'm not an alcoholic

4288.92 --> 4294.9400000000005
even though yeah I have to admit I do

4291.44 --> 4294.94
currently drink every day

4295.52 --> 4299.26
but I stick to the three beers

4303.14 --> 4308.179
and I do realize that cannot last

4305.42 --> 4309.56
forever I'm not going to be drinking

4308.179 --> 4311.6
like that

4309.56 --> 4313.900000000001
until I die

4311.6 --> 4317.06
at least I don't hope I'm gonna die

4313.9 --> 4319.04
anytime soon but I know you don't grow

4317.06 --> 4322.159000000001
super old with that at some point you

4319.04 --> 4324.8
gotta stop I know it

4322.159 --> 4326.36
but I am just trying to enjoy it while I

4324.8 --> 4328.6990000000005
still can

4326.36 --> 4331.159
and in a way it serves a very important

4328.699 --> 4333.799999999999
function because I am such a freaking

4331.159 --> 4338.92
serious person all of the time

4333.8 --> 4338.92
like unrelenting these areas really

4340.1 --> 4344.4800000000005
I'm very happy that I still have some

4342.38 --> 4346.34
sense of humor so that I can relieve

4344.48 --> 4348.739
myself from that a little every now and

4346.34 --> 4350.4800000000005
then overall I'm so serious and when I

4348.739 --> 4353.299999999999
drink alcohol

4350.48 --> 4357.379999999999
the world isn't as

4353.3 --> 4360.26
sharp edged and painful to me

4357.38 --> 4364.52
so I can like dive into something and

4360.26 --> 4368.96
still kind of enjoy it and and not

4364.52 --> 4371.38
just be like why this why that

4368.96 --> 4371.38
right

4377.06 --> 4383.06
and when yeah usually when I drink it's

4380.6 --> 4385.34
also when I kind of hang around with the

4383.06 --> 4388.159000000001
guys from flutter debate in the after

4385.34 --> 4391.400000000001
like after the recording stop

4388.159 --> 4393.86
and then yeah it does also kind of like

4391.4 --> 4396.44
break me open it'll make me more forward

4393.86 --> 4400.28
which is to me in an advantage and

4396.44 --> 4402.08
perhaps to them sometimes a disadvantage

4400.28 --> 4404.96
what

4402.08 --> 4407.179
yeah you know if I'm gonna drink I'm

4404.96 --> 4409.64
gonna use it

4407.179 --> 4412.76
don't do anything unless there is some

4409.64 --> 4416.900000000001
kind of advantage over it right

4412.76 --> 4419.42
ignorance is never an advantage

4416.9 --> 4423.679
if you're going to do something don't be

4419.42 --> 4425.719
ignorant to figure out what's what you

4423.679 --> 4429.34
could do with it and then give it a

4425.719 --> 4429.34
place that's functional

4432.199 --> 4436.419999999999
through everything everything everything

4434.06 --> 4436.42
everything

4440.42 --> 4444.02
hmm

4441.8 --> 4445.6990000000005
that's when you call start calling 10th

4444.02 --> 4448.2390000000005
a boomer

4445.699 --> 4448.239
what

4453.86 --> 4458.96
you have to let the drug or spirit in

4456.38 --> 4462.86
for you to take it yeah that's correct

4458.96 --> 4465.199
getting wisdom that's absolutely correct

4462.86 --> 4467.12
but yeah when you're younger you don't

4465.199 --> 4470.239
really realize that when you get older

4467.12 --> 4474.04
you realize that more

4470.239 --> 4474.04
and you're more able to choose

4498.44 --> 4503.299999999999
oh right that's when you start calling

4501.32 --> 4505.04
10th Boomer is when I have a bit of

4503.3 --> 4507.8
alcohol

4505.04 --> 4509.659
well I'd call him a boomer anyway for

4507.8 --> 4514.219
comedic effect

4509.659 --> 4516.92
but I more easily let that let that out

4514.219 --> 4519.159
when I have a bit of beer yeah that's

4516.92 --> 4519.159
right

4519.739 --> 4526.419999999999
I become more casual about it all it's

4522.86 --> 4526.42
just throw out [ __ ]

4529.46 --> 4532.659
how are you doing by the way Adam

4539.96 --> 4547.2390000000005
kind of a ghost show talking about

4542.3 --> 4547.2390000000005
ghosts and things and spirit mechanics

4547.82 --> 4551.62
I wonder what I should title it

4591.44 --> 4594.04
all right

4596.9 --> 4602.659
not about to pick apples cool

4600.98 --> 4605.12
like

4602.659 --> 4607.96
in your own apple tree or are you going

4605.12 --> 4607.96
to a

4610.219 --> 4614.02
call that an archery

4617.179 --> 4620.14
the family or something

4645.98 --> 4649.82
oh

4647.36 --> 4653.739
cool you got your own apples that's

4649.82 --> 4653.739
awesome Adam lucky man

4677.96 --> 4680.56
hmm

4713.719 --> 4720.26
alcohol is destruction of a Nation herb

4716.84 --> 4721.28
is the healing well he would say that of

4720.26 --> 4724.159000000001
course

4721.28 --> 4727.04
the Rastafarian and all

4724.159 --> 4729.44
I mean look

4727.04 --> 4733.1
cannabis is not

4729.44 --> 4735.44
like the exact opposite of alcohol it

4733.1 --> 4737.2390000000005
comes with risks too

4735.44 --> 4739.639999999999
especially when you're not used to it

4737.239 --> 4741.44
right the same thing happens as with

4739.64 --> 4742.58
alcohol especially when you're not used

4741.44 --> 4746.98
to it like

4742.58 --> 4746.98
first few times weird [ __ ] happens

4747.08 --> 4752.6
but

4749.12 --> 4754.76
overall the typical impulses that come

4752.6 --> 4756.14
out of it are much less destructive and

4754.76 --> 4758.12
this has even been psychologically

4756.14 --> 4761.6
studied

4758.12 --> 4764.3
that yeah people with alcohol have

4761.6 --> 4766.34
Tendencies to violence sometimes so

4764.3 --> 4769.46
especially certain individuals that just

4766.34 --> 4771.679
respond to it like that cannabis that's

4769.46 --> 4774.9800000000005
very rare the worst that could happen

4771.679 --> 4778.179
mostly is that people go

4774.98 --> 4778.178999999999
like paranoid

4778.94 --> 4784.46
or like super emotional or something

4781.1 --> 4786.320000000001
right but

4784.46 --> 4789.32
like unless they're like in the middle

4786.32 --> 4792.199
of a spousal with a heavy argument or

4789.32 --> 4794.36
whatever breakup situation like it's

4792.199 --> 4796.82
very rare that violence comes out of

4794.36 --> 4800.239
cannabis smoking it's very very rare

4796.82 --> 4801.199
that that actually happens distress for

4800.239 --> 4803.178999999999
sure

4801.199 --> 4805.419999999999
but never violence and that's a big

4803.179 --> 4805.42
difference

4808.699 --> 4813.919999999999
right and when you get used to it

4811.52 --> 4817.360000000001
the impact

4813.92 --> 4817.36
becomes much less

4817.88 --> 4821.139
in a negative sense

4846.739 --> 4851.86
haha

4848.3 --> 4851.860000000001
yeah one for the unit

4852.62 --> 4858.0199999999995
there's some crazy [ __ ] going on over

4855.02 --> 4861.320000000001
here in the Netherlands as well

4858.02 --> 4863.38
like I think they're just kind of like

4861.32 --> 4866.599999999999
forcefully

4863.38 --> 4868.639
initiated like the V passport [ __ ] and

4866.6 --> 4870.219
all that like

4868.639 --> 4873.1990000000005
but

4870.219 --> 4876.139
nobody's really buying it

4873.199 --> 4878.299999999999
it's like the government itself the

4876.139 --> 4881.0
people that are forwarding are kind of

4878.3 --> 4883.88
being isolated like you are fake news

4881.0 --> 4887.659
you're a hostile copper a takeover like

4883.88 --> 4893.02
everybody is seeing it

4887.659 --> 4893.0199999999995
people are starting to stop cooperating

4894.639 --> 4900.5
and yeah they they're getting a very

4898.52 --> 4903.1990000000005
highly analyzed by a whole bunch of

4900.5 --> 4905.9
people including respected people

4903.199 --> 4908.419999999999
for being a hostile operation that's

4905.9 --> 4910.4
against the interest of the Dutch people

4908.42 --> 4913.82
right and that's good

4910.4 --> 4916.159
I don't see any dramatic actions to

4913.82 --> 4917.84
really stop them halt them in their

4916.159 --> 4919.5199999999995
tracks or remove them that's the

4917.84 --> 4923.26
worrying part

4919.52 --> 4925.639
but there seems to be just a lot of

4923.26 --> 4928.360000000001
non-cooperation happening

4925.639 --> 4928.36
that's good

4936.44 --> 4942.799999999999
but yeah they're trying to be

4939.38 --> 4945.139
super liberal

4942.8 --> 4947.2390000000005
communist fascist whatever you yeah

4945.139 --> 4948.92
whatever they are these days they're

4947.239 --> 4951.08
trying to be like that in the Dutch

4948.92 --> 4954.139
government like very like they were

4951.08 --> 4957.32
always like trying to be like

4954.139 --> 4959.659000000001
the Demonic left in America

4957.32 --> 4962.299999999999
and like Trudeau like they are part of

4959.659 --> 4964.638999999999
that group these specific government

4962.3 --> 4966.4400000000005
Grapplers

4964.639 --> 4968.96
that we have

4966.44 --> 4972.5199999999995
they're being like that but

4968.96 --> 4972.52
they're identified

4974.86 --> 4983.679
like there's not not as much not as many

4978.32 --> 4983.679
people buying it as say 10 years ago

4987.92 --> 4992.42
right nobody goes to the hospital from

4990.62 --> 4994.58
we that that's I forgot to mention that

4992.42 --> 4998.3
as well yes you cannot overdose on

4994.58 --> 5000.58
cannabis that's impossible like you

4998.3 --> 5003.400000000001
literally cannot do it

5000.58 --> 5006.58
right doesn't mean that you cannot die

5003.4 --> 5009.659
with it in your body especially if you

5006.58 --> 5013.0599999999995
also use other drugs

5009.659 --> 5014.199
alongside it yeah but just cannabis

5013.06 --> 5017.320000000001
alone now

5014.199 --> 5020.339999999999
it just cannot kill you unless you

5017.32 --> 5020.34
already have like

5024.94 --> 5030.159
unless you already had yeah unless your

5028.06 --> 5032.8
lungs are like about to die out or

5030.159 --> 5035.94
something inside yeah I can't think of a

5032.8 --> 5035.9400000000005
normal situation

5036.04 --> 5042.28
right nobody ever goes into emergency

5038.8 --> 5045.820000000001
rooms because of smoking cannabis

5042.28 --> 5048.34
elastic cannabis was poison

5045.82 --> 5050.46
like with some other substance or

5048.34 --> 5050.46
whatever

5095.739 --> 5102.82
ah gaining wisdom I I disagree with that

5099.46 --> 5105.28
analogy alcohol derived from wrath and

5102.82 --> 5109.0
death no

5105.28 --> 5111.46
no what is the alcohol it's fruit it's

5109.0 --> 5113.639
always fruits

5111.46 --> 5116.32
and it's basically

5113.639 --> 5119.1990000000005
digestion it is a

5116.32 --> 5122.139
natural form of digestion

5119.199 --> 5124.12
it's not rotting

5122.139 --> 5127.3
it's alkalizing

5124.12 --> 5131.639
it's not a regular rot

5127.3 --> 5131.639
regular rot is not good news

5171.46 --> 5174.0
hmm

5174.76 --> 5177.76
foreign

5181.44 --> 5186.879999999999
yeah Adam

5183.34 --> 5190.179
leave it to the bees for the pollination

5186.88 --> 5193.0
do you also have like a bee nest

5190.179 --> 5196.4800000000005
not not a beehive but just for regular

5193.0 --> 5198.639
bees like little tubes because if you

5196.48 --> 5199.839999999999
have that pretty close to your apple

5198.639 --> 5201.6990000000005
trees

5199.84 --> 5205.0
then eventually the bees will Discover

5201.699 --> 5207.759999999999
it and use it as like a traveling Point

5205.0 --> 5211.86
bringing them closer to the

5207.76 --> 5211.860000000001
to the trees you wish to be pollinated

5211.9 --> 5217.739
it's very easy you don't have to do any

5214.239 --> 5217.739
maintenance over it at all

5249.94 --> 5252.599999999999
wow

5253.84 --> 5259.62
yeah one for you that is they're

5256.659 --> 5263.379999999999
completely out of their minds

5259.62 --> 5267.099999999999
I really really don't understand how

5263.38 --> 5269.4400000000005
that this is able to persist

5267.1 --> 5273.42
all these people at this point they

5269.44 --> 5277.178999999999
should just be arrested for

5273.42 --> 5280.8
blatantly proven conspiracy

5277.179 --> 5280.8
to murder people

5282.1 --> 5285.179
it is what it is

5287.38 --> 5295.3
this is like death through willful

5290.5 --> 5295.3
negligence and misconduct

5295.36 --> 5300.28
but organized

5297.46 --> 5303.1
it's what it is it's like

5300.28 --> 5306.219
as soon as you look into it that's what

5303.1 --> 5308.8
the result will yield

5306.219 --> 5310.9
I don't understand how this [ __ ] can

5308.8 --> 5313.42
still keep continuing like it does like

5310.9 --> 5316.659
why isn't aren't people just like even

5313.42 --> 5320.26
in the security forces or like

5316.659 --> 5323.08
okay we don't want to die

5320.26 --> 5325.0
maybe we should literally step forward

5323.08 --> 5327.82
and like

5325.0 --> 5331.06
do a coup or something oh no cool yeah

5327.82 --> 5333.159
do it do the [ __ ] cool already

5331.06 --> 5335.679
do it

5333.159 --> 5337.299999999999
all the countries

5335.679 --> 5340.26
do it

5337.3 --> 5340.26
do it now

5342.4 --> 5349.179
get these

5345.179 --> 5349.179
psychotic eugenicist

5350.159 --> 5356.099999999999
politicians

5352.08 --> 5356.1
out of the government

5379.48 --> 5387.4
right if they just leave it the way it

5383.38 --> 5390.88
is it's already terrible right then I'd

5387.4 --> 5392.92
be like well okay maybe it does kind of

5390.88 --> 5396.36
serve a function although it's very

5392.92 --> 5400.2390000000005
graveled the problem is they're not

5396.36 --> 5403.92
leaving it the way it is which is

5400.239 --> 5405.54
already terrible they have vowed

5403.92 --> 5409.179
vowed

5405.54 --> 5412.36
publicly to make it worse to roll out

5409.179 --> 5415.54
worse things make it harsher make it

5412.36 --> 5418.599999999999
worse make it more terrible lies more

5415.54 --> 5422.5
demonic more anti-human they're not

5418.6 --> 5428.56
stopping the only way to end this is

5422.5 --> 5432.58
through coops do it do it now

5428.56 --> 5436.3
every moment you wait more suffering

5432.58 --> 5441.719
more unnecessary satanic death and

5436.3 --> 5441.719
misery and ugliness and poisoning

5443.56 --> 5450.04
do it now

5445.9 --> 5451.54
every moment you wait it all gets worse

5450.04 --> 5454.48
all of it

5451.54 --> 5457.0
there is no point at which it stops

5454.48 --> 5462.04
getting worse there's only one thing

5457.0 --> 5466.239
that can be done a coup do it do it now

5462.04 --> 5469.92
like seriously [ __ ] the consequences

5466.239 --> 5474.28
if they have some creepy

5469.92 --> 5478.62
trap at the other side for where like to

5474.28 --> 5478.62
Blackmail every [ __ ] it

5479.08 --> 5485.08
right anything they throw at you

5481.6 --> 5488.5
it's just gonna get them even more in

5485.08 --> 5491.4
prison more killed and other culprits

5488.5 --> 5491.4
rooted

5493.42 --> 5503.26
can't keep postponing this it's imminent

5498.219 --> 5503.26
death if you do imminent

5514.08 --> 5520.9
says the guy

5517.179 --> 5524.7390000000005
living off social welfare flatter in the

5520.9 --> 5526.12
Netherlands in in gay Central

5524.739 --> 5529.0199999999995
ugh

5526.12 --> 5529.0199999999995
I know

5533.02 --> 5537.9400000000005
still valid analysis I've been trying to

5535.54 --> 5540.4
say this for a while now

5537.94 --> 5542.799999999999
nothing is even stopping me

5540.4 --> 5545.08
like is there no way to stop it anymore

5542.8 --> 5547.6
is there literally nothing more we could

5545.08 --> 5548.5599999999995
do like everything we do gets us killed

5547.6 --> 5553.3
everything

5548.56 --> 5555.96
and it's only our unwillingness to to be

5553.3 --> 5555.96
destroyed

5556.179 --> 5562.36
that keeps us in this suspense where

5559.179 --> 5566.52
nothing becomes real and while everybody

5562.36 --> 5566.5199999999995
gets exterminated around you

5567.46 --> 5573.88
I mean why would you want to sit through

5570.88 --> 5577.06
it like that anymore

5573.88 --> 5581.38
why would you postpone the end if

5577.06 --> 5583.84
everything will be destroyed

5581.38 --> 5587.38
why would you want to postpone the

5583.84 --> 5590.38
ending if everything will be destroyed

5587.38 --> 5590.38
why

5593.679 --> 5599.32
what's it worth

5596.26 --> 5602.02
do you know how that is at the end

5599.32 --> 5604.659
having postponed it to the end and then

5602.02 --> 5609.040000000001
knowing it everything is destroyed

5604.659 --> 5612.28
everything not a single good element

5609.04 --> 5614.8
that can touch your mind again not a

5612.28 --> 5617.92
single thing it will all be destroyed

5614.8 --> 5620.26
everything you thought

5617.92 --> 5622.3
what you took for granted everything

5620.26 --> 5626.56
life

5622.3 --> 5630.12
concept of life itself

5626.56 --> 5632.679
living things green things everything

5630.12 --> 5635.739
right I'm not talking about climate

5632.679 --> 5639.6990000000005
hysteria [ __ ] cult I'm talking about

5635.739 --> 5642.94
what the people doing that will do if we

5639.699 --> 5646.199
just let them do it if we just let them

5642.94 --> 5649.9
continue whatever freaking backlash

5646.199 --> 5654.4
blackmail trap they have on the world

5649.9 --> 5657.699
they need to be stopped no matter the

5654.4 --> 5661.659
consequences because everything will be

5657.699 --> 5664.299999999999
destroyed everything if we don't move if

5661.659 --> 5668.4
if there is if they're not removed

5664.3 --> 5668.400000000001
everything will be destroyed everything

5684.58 --> 5691.119
it cannot continue like this this crazy

5687.82 --> 5692.259999999999
[ __ ] cannot continue right

5691.119 --> 5695.5
because

5692.26 --> 5698.38
eventually yeah oh we will survive

5695.5 --> 5700.239
through we just don't but take a bite we

5698.38 --> 5702.52
just yeah

5700.239 --> 5705.759999999999
in the meantime you're going to have to

5702.52 --> 5710.02
sit through or try to avoid knowing

5705.76 --> 5712.26
about how Millions potentially billions

5710.02 --> 5715.780000000001
of people are getting psychologically

5712.26 --> 5720.219
tortured mutilated and murdered

5715.78 --> 5722.98
everywhere constantly openly

5720.219 --> 5725.56
oh you think that's a good tactic you

5722.98 --> 5728.379999999999
think that's a good tactic to just oh

5725.56 --> 5731.8
well I'm too smart to fall for their

5728.38 --> 5736.06
tricks I'm just gonna sit here do my own

5731.8 --> 5740.5
thing with God and watch as the freaking

5736.06 --> 5743.46
world burns down gets mutilated tortured

5740.5 --> 5743.46
and murdered

5743.86 --> 5749.219
you think God's gonna be thankful in the

5747.1 --> 5749.219
end

5755.619 --> 5760.719
no

5757.119 --> 5764.139
you are going straight to Hell In The

5760.719 --> 5769.9800000000005
End if we do not move

5764.139 --> 5769.9800000000005
nobody can win by not moving nobody

5792.1 --> 5799.659000000001
it has to stop this game they're playing

5795.28 --> 5802.78
has to stop permanently

5799.659 --> 5804.699
and their Roots must be unrooted it must

5802.78 --> 5807.58
all be rooted

5804.699 --> 5809.799999999999
pull out every part of it every part of

5807.58 --> 5812.32
it all the banking Roots all this

5809.8 --> 5815.38
[ __ ] psycho multi-generational

5812.32 --> 5817.9
conspiracy have to be rooted and

5815.38 --> 5819.82
exterminated I'm sorry there's no other

5817.9 --> 5822.28
way I don't give a [ __ ] what your

5819.82 --> 5824.5
[ __ ] little designation is we're just

5822.28 --> 5828.46

5831.639 --> 5841.02

5836.5 --> 5844.3
can't let this rot continue it is

5841.02 --> 5845.4400000000005
physically impossible everything will

5844.3 --> 5849.28
die

5845.44 --> 5853.599999999999
everything will die if this continues it

5849.28 --> 5860.58
has to be removed now

5853.6 --> 5860.58
stop waiting stop postponing do it now

5862.42 --> 5869.7390000000005

5866.08 --> 5872.739
then don't just do it there it has to be

5869.739 --> 5875.919999999999
everywhere it has to be everywhere they

5872.739 --> 5879.459999999999
have to be routed this cancerous Clique

5875.92 --> 5882.28
of multi-generational psychopath devil

5879.46 --> 5885.34
worshipers that are doing all this have

5882.28 --> 5887.739
set Roots everywhere everywhere in their

5885.34 --> 5892.2390000000005
world and they have to be completely

5887.739 --> 5895.739
routed every detail every little

5892.239 --> 5899.08
snip in a root every part it has to be

5895.739 --> 5902.799999999999
completely removed

5899.08 --> 5905.139
like even if it seems that that will

5902.8 --> 5909.400000000001
cause the world to die it doesn't matter

5905.139 --> 5914.26
it doesn't matter anymore it has to be

5909.4 --> 5919.0599999999995
removed or we all go to hell

5914.26 --> 5922.619000000001
or we all go to hell every single human

5919.06 --> 5922.619000000001
being that's alive right now

5925.6 --> 5931.96
this has been postponed for too long and

5929.5 --> 5935.44
it's going to be over

5931.96 --> 5939.46
everything is if we let this rot

5935.44 --> 5943.54
continue they have to be removed

5939.46 --> 5946.44
cannot postpost then it's much longer it

5943.54 --> 5946.44
you shouldn't

5947.619 --> 5952.839999999999
it's not worth it whatever you think is

5950.44 --> 5955.419999999999
a good reason to postpone it it's not

5952.84 --> 5958.02
worth it

5955.42 --> 5958.02
right

5958.5 --> 5964.54
and pro no

5961.0 --> 5967.239
no no [ __ ] demonstration Pro I mean

5964.54 --> 5968.44
yeah it's good it's not doing anything

5967.239 --> 5971.08
though

5968.44 --> 5973.0
the people that are in control don't

5971.08 --> 5976.44
give a [ __ ]

5973.0 --> 5976.44
they openly

5976.78 --> 5981.239
poo poo it they don't give a [ __ ]

5981.699 --> 5988.78
they are not going to stop

5984.28 --> 5992.619
they have to be forcefully removed

5988.78 --> 5994.78
they're not gonna sway over protests or

5992.619 --> 6000.42
Riot over anything

5994.78 --> 6000.42
they have to be forcefully removed

6012.179 --> 6018.2390000000005
I don't give a [ __ ] what you like or you

6015.3 --> 6019.56
don't talking about freaking survival of

6018.239 --> 6022.739
the world here

6019.56 --> 6025.1990000000005
the coming catastrophe yeah

6022.739 --> 6027.0599999999995
everybody's squirting over that oh oh

6025.199 --> 6028.619
Bill's shutter is such a new world order

6027.06 --> 6031.02
she always talking about the coming

6028.619 --> 6033.0599999999995
catastrophe of course that means

6031.02 --> 6035.040000000001
everything we've constantly been talking

6033.06 --> 6038.04
about and that means he's on his side

6035.04 --> 6040.139
it's not like he's literally trying to

6038.04 --> 6042.179
warn us hey

6040.139 --> 6044.639
hello

6042.179 --> 6047.52
you might want to do something

6044.639 --> 6049.7390000000005
oh you want to do a new world order [ __ ]

6047.52 --> 6052.1990000000005
climate called [ __ ] if you're stupid

6049.739 --> 6053.879999999999
enough to do that then do that but I

6052.199 --> 6057.119
don't think he was actually addressing

6053.88 --> 6061.9400000000005
it I think he was addressing everybody

6057.119 --> 6065.339999999999
because Shatner is not a straightforward

6061.94 --> 6067.259999999999
psychotic New World Order Shield he's

6065.34 --> 6069.54
had his moments where he has kind of

6067.26 --> 6072.0
done that

6069.54 --> 6073.619
and I know it wears on him and he has it

6072.0 --> 6077.52
he has issues

6073.619 --> 6081.239
but he's not exclusively like that

6077.52 --> 6084.0
he's not a soulless wretch

6081.239 --> 6086.28
and I think his warning is a wider

6084.0 --> 6088.98
warning like hey you might want to

6086.28 --> 6091.44
[ __ ] do something about this or

6088.98 --> 6094.98
everything will be destroyed this

6091.44 --> 6096.599999999999
vulnerable little Mother Earth

6094.98 --> 6098.879999999999
yeah

6096.6 --> 6102.06
all life

6098.88 --> 6103.86
you make the connection yet people you

6102.06 --> 6106.080000000001
make the connection yet or you're gonna

6103.86 --> 6111.54
squirt some more

6106.08 --> 6113.639
you're [ __ ] weak pathetic demon spawn

6111.54 --> 6116.159
you're gonna squirt some more or you're

6113.639 --> 6118.52
gonna actually do something about this

6116.159 --> 6118.5199999999995
[ __ ]

6119.76 --> 6122.6
huh

6129.659 --> 6133.199
the fact that they want you to protest

6131.4 --> 6136.94
shows you will leave in your mouth well

6133.199 --> 6136.94
yeah right that's a good point

6137.219 --> 6143.46
that's why I don't recommend it

6139.8 --> 6145.5
it doesn't work anymore

6143.46 --> 6147.679
there's no more communication and

6145.5 --> 6150.06
protesting is a form of communication

6147.679 --> 6152.36
they're not communicating with us

6150.06 --> 6152.360000000001
anymore

6152.699 --> 6159.08
do you understand they are not the

6154.92 --> 6161.58
political extremist eugenicists are not

6159.08 --> 6165.54
communicate communicating with the

6161.58 --> 6168.78
people anymore they don't care they want

6165.54 --> 6171.679
you to die

6168.78 --> 6174.599999999999
what are you gonna do about it

6171.679 --> 6176.1
protests they don't give a [ __ ] about

6174.6 --> 6178.679
your protest

6176.1 --> 6181.320000000001
they just want you to exhaust yourself

6178.679 --> 6185.42
give up and die

6181.32 --> 6185.42
now what are you gonna do about that

6196.02 --> 6202.1990000000005
