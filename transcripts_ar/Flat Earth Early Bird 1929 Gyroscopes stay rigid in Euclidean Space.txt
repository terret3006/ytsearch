raining it's a bit of sun coming through

96.72 --> 106.24
right now but yeah it's still windy and

102.68 --> 110.799
cold it's not

106.24 --> 110.79899999999999
uh not particularly

115.24 --> 119.24
appealing right

126.799 --> 134.44
so okay well technically Moxy is first

130.239 --> 137.12
in chat good to see you Gary Fe fiber

134.44 --> 142.12

right right yeah anyway good to see you

160.879 --> 168.159
all it is Thursday the 25th of April

165.159 --> 168.159
2024

175.24 --> 178.28900000000002
[Applause]

181.68 --> 187.84
temperature is 8°

184.08 --> 190.28
C 71% humidity and that would explain

187.84 --> 190.28
why it's so

191.84 --> 198.31900000000002
cold

194.319 --> 198.319
oh okay according to the

200.12 --> 205.519
predictions says

203.0 --> 207.159
that kind of during the weekend but

205.519 --> 210.28
especially after it's going to get a lot

207.159 --> 212.67999999999998
warmer 25° next Wednesday today that

210.28 --> 216.36
sounds really

212.68 --> 218.84
nice looking forward to

216.36 --> 220.12
that right but for now it's still going

218.84 --> 224.04
to

220.12 --> 224.04
be 9

225.04 --> 232.12
12 still going to be rest of a dreary

229.12 --> 232.12
week

234.84 --> 240.439
right so

236.84 --> 241.68
yeah starting just a tiny minute tiny

240.439 --> 244.84
little bit

241.68 --> 247.799
late cuz I was watch watching uh

244.84 --> 251.959
Infowars the wit it

247.799 --> 253.87900000000002
debate about Flat Earth catching up to

251.959 --> 257.6
that

253.879 --> 262.519
and let's see how far am my 40 45

257.6 --> 262.519
minutes in and yeah it's

262.88 --> 268.4
interesting although there's a lot of

264.96 --> 271.71999999999997
like talking past each other is not a

268.4 --> 271.71999999999997
with it's being

274.4 --> 279.67999999999995
yes it's not being a very direct

277.12 --> 282.56
approach to the fundamentals and is like

279.68 --> 287.88
kind of like going around like oh look

282.56 --> 291.28000000000003
evidence here evidence there against

287.88 --> 291.28
it it's

291.72 --> 299.6
informative but he's not being very

295.28 --> 299.59999999999997
hardcore about it

302.199 --> 308.40000000000003
but

303.88 --> 312.84
yeah it's it's a interesting interview

308.4 --> 315.96
to listen at to listen to

312.84 --> 319.59999999999997
so I kind of want to continue it but

315.96 --> 319.59999999999997
yeah I mean I got my show to

324.52 --> 330.4
do

327.28 --> 332.67999999999995
right anyway good again good to have you

330.4 --> 332.67999999999995
all

339.56 --> 347.919
here yesterday also watched

343.6 --> 347.91900000000004
part of Rebel Moon part

351.039 --> 355.68
two right and I've started to notice a

354.039 --> 357.4
certain pattern that was also there in

355.68 --> 360.16
the first part but especially in the

357.4 --> 362.79999999999995
second and that it's like

360.16 --> 365.72
a lot of it is like shot almost like

362.8 --> 368.919
it's just a music

365.72 --> 371.16
video like very atmospheric very in the

368.919 --> 374.919
moment

371.16 --> 378.52000000000004
very trying to communicate feelings a

374.919 --> 380.4
lot about it all it's like trying to

378.52 --> 384.919
make you really

380.4 --> 384.919
connect to it emotionally

396.4 --> 401.599
have you seen any of their show it's it

399.44 --> 407.039
Jaren

401.599 --> 407.039
Etc uh no not recently Gary

411.52 --> 417.599
F oh have I ever been on the shows no

423.16 --> 428.16
I mean I'd like to be on Wit It show I

425.639 --> 431.0
don't know if he'd have

428.16 --> 434.91900000000004
me no

431.0 --> 434.919
idea jiren I doubt

437.0 --> 443.919
it I mean like jiren had this

441.639 --> 447.0
whole

443.919 --> 448.75899999999996
debacle with Nathan Oakley a while back

447.0 --> 450.639
and like I don't think I'll ever like

448.759 --> 453.759
connect up to that and I don't really

450.639 --> 453.759
like jiren that much

461.44 --> 466.08
anyway hard to be line to line up with

464.199 --> 468.879
the T

466.08 --> 471.68
maybe I mean I could do it in like the

468.879 --> 471.68
evenings or

477.919 --> 482.039
something but it would be kind of fun to

480.52 --> 487.31899999999996
like have a show

482.039 --> 490.759
about like what what don't we

487.319 --> 492.84000000000003
know cuz that's kind of like yeah where

490.759 --> 495.36
I try to step in and like give

492.84 --> 497.35999999999996
suggestions and ideas and like yeah what

495.36 --> 503.0
what could

497.36 --> 503.0
be that would be fun to talk about

511.719 --> 518.0
right but I mean I'm not like reaching

514.12 --> 521.12
out to wit it I I could like maybe if I

518.0 --> 524.159
bump into him on uh Earth

521.12 --> 527.0
Awakenings Discord Channel I might ask

524.159 --> 531.56
him like Hey wi it could we maybe do a

527.0 --> 531.56
show that would be interesting

546.2 --> 552.6400000000001
right so I'm definitely open to the

550.0 --> 556.76
suggestion like if I'd had an

552.64 --> 561.92
opportunity to do a show together yeah I

556.76 --> 561.92
would if witd would have me

580.839 --> 588.32
although there's always the risk that

583.8 --> 588.3199999999999
we'll get into an argument about ether

592.48 --> 598.399
though like there is that risk

602.839 --> 610.6
what friends maybe on Space audits I

608.2 --> 610.6
what is

614.959 --> 621.1999999999999
that the Patricia shows were always

617.48 --> 621.2
great yeah I know

630.8 --> 634.3199999999999
wasn't Patricia like planning to come

632.88 --> 637.72
back

634.32 --> 640.9590000000001
somewhere I'd love to be like on their

637.72 --> 640.9590000000001
show again that would be

647.399 --> 652.519
amazing all right anyway everybody here

650.32 --> 657.24
don't forget the Rogan it

652.519 --> 657.24
up and share the show

665.24 --> 669.0790000000001
change the subject what do you mean

667.519 --> 673.32
change to the

669.079 --> 673.3199999999999
subject projecting much red

675.48 --> 680.04
Sabbath oh a mun oh

681.36 --> 684.72
goody Richard

688.24 --> 692.279
G e

720.839 --> 723.24
same

723.6 --> 731.0790000000001
crew I yeah sure I I don't know about

727.72 --> 732.44
them like how do I contact them where

731.079 --> 737.3199999999999
can I find

732.44 --> 737.32
that never heard of that before

750.92 --> 758.5999999999999
okay maybe I

753.8 --> 758.5999999999999
could take it on YouTube

760.31 --> 763.38
[Music]

796.92 --> 801.7199999999999
okay I think I found

798.76 --> 804.04
it is that like with an icon with a bear

801.72 --> 804.0400000000001
in

804.199 --> 808.92
space still a small Channel

836.16 --> 840.4399999999999
who man that Channel's been around for a

838.8 --> 844.68
long

840.44 --> 844.6800000000001
time so many links to

864.56 --> 869.68
that all right yeah I'll check it out

880.279 --> 885.12
W it should be easier why

887.639 --> 891.72
duper what's that going to amount

894.04 --> 901.8
to I mean the the conclusion would be

897.24 --> 901.8
like yeah ether is not scientific

904.56 --> 908.04
and and that's

914.16 --> 918.88
it I don't see what the point would

922.759 --> 928.319
be he'll get over his ether yeah well

926.16 --> 930.319
good luck to that dupons he's not going

928.319 --> 934.519
to

930.319 --> 934.519
just for the popularity of it

937.319 --> 943.079
alone I don't see how he's going to get

939.759 --> 943.0790000000001
over it

979.079 --> 984.92
doesn't know anything about it what are

981.12 --> 984.92
you talking about Gary

1018.24 --> 1024.92
look the IDE of ether is going to be out

1020.8 --> 1024.9199999999998
there for a while it's just

1025.24 --> 1030.1200000000001
that if you're going to hang a lot of

1028.0 --> 1034.079
value

1030.12 --> 1037.1599999999999
or foundational importance onto it

1034.079 --> 1037.1599999999999
you're going to run into

1037.36 --> 1042.1599999999999
trouble that's it pretty

1039.76 --> 1045.0
much right if you're going to tie it

1042.16 --> 1048.96
into all these traits like of

1045.0 --> 1050.88
light and the motion of things like

1048.96 --> 1053.52
that's where you run into trouble that's

1050.88 --> 1053.5200000000002
where it's

1058.12 --> 1064.52
dispelled

1059.88 --> 1068.44
right like light doesn't require another

1064.52 --> 1069.52
medium to move cuz it's not a wave it's

1068.44 --> 1071.919
not

1069.52 --> 1077.52
secondary it arguably doesn't even have

1071.919 --> 1080.8400000000001
a speed not that's been proven

1077.52 --> 1080.84
right and

1080.96 --> 1083.28
well

1083.4 --> 1087.4
electrically you could consider The

1085.48 --> 1090.72
Ether to

1087.4 --> 1093.159
exist but I mean that's like an entirely

1090.72 --> 1093.159
different

1093.36 --> 1099.6399999999999
thing and so there's like that's why

1096.919 --> 1103.039
there's the the wheelie it's a whole

1099.64 --> 1105.919
bunch of scatter gunning different

1103.039 --> 1109.2
traits different little

1105.919 --> 1111.2800000000002
phenomena that really don't actually tie

1109.2 --> 1113.1200000000001
in with one another like that are

1111.28 --> 1120.0
crossing different

1113.12 --> 1120.0
fields of physics that just don't really

1124.76 --> 1130.84
[Music]

1127.159 --> 1133.7600000000002
relate like there's barely a

1130.84 --> 1137.1999999999998
correlation and you have to fill up the

1133.76 --> 1140.76
gaps to make it seem like it's like the

1137.2 --> 1142.559
correlation is very solid and that that

1140.76 --> 1147.0
that it's a

1142.559 --> 1147.0
thing and that's it

1173.75 --> 1178.52
[Music]

1175.679 --> 1181.0800000000002
all right the entire foundational

1178.52 --> 1183.799
premise of The Ether and its conception

1181.08 --> 1187.039
is that it's a

1183.799 --> 1189.679
medium oh there is no medium

1187.039 --> 1193.12
necessary like that there

1189.679 --> 1196.6000000000001
isn't light doesn't require a medium

1193.12 --> 1198.9599999999998
just requires available volume that is

1196.6 --> 1200.559
transparent

1198.96 --> 1206.08
and that's

1200.559 --> 1206.08
it doesn't need to travel or ride

1223.4 --> 1228.48
anything right if anybody has any

1226.0 --> 1233.32
questions relating to Ether what is said

1228.48 --> 1233.32
about about it like feel free to ask

1242.16 --> 1246.009
[Music]

1268.48 --> 1271.559
there's some drilling happening in the

1269.919 --> 1273.7990000000002
house so you might be hearing that a

1271.559 --> 1276.799
little bit here and there not sure if

1273.799 --> 1276.799
you're picking up on

1285.0 --> 1292.76
that all right anyway h I slept quite

1290.32 --> 1295.6789999999999
well really kind of happy that the full

1292.76 --> 1295.679
moon is over

1316.52 --> 1322.559
again one of

1319.12 --> 1322.559
who gives a [ __ ] about

1331.32 --> 1338.6
Greta like I'm not interested in Greta

1334.96 --> 1341.6000000000001
thunberg or anything red Sabbath I just

1338.6 --> 1346.36
said one time kind of partially as a

1341.6 --> 1349.4399999999998
joke that like yeah I mean I don't think

1346.36 --> 1352.8799999999999
she's an ugly

1349.44 --> 1357.24
person necessarily that's all like I'm

1352.88 --> 1357.24
not interested I don't care what she

1359.32 --> 1364.06
thinks so don't know why you keep on

1362.52 --> 1367.26
bringing that back

1364.06 --> 1367.26
[Music]

1373.48 --> 1380.44
up they needed something that caused the

1376.72 --> 1380.44
drift and came up with mus

1381.24 --> 1387.52
yeah but what drift though Gary what

1384.52 --> 1387.52
drift

1416.81 --> 1420.01
[Music]

1424.559 --> 1433.1589999999999
right broken gyro grift drift

1427.679 --> 1433.159
grift it's like uh

1433.76 --> 1440.44
no a gyroscope drifting that means it's

1437.76 --> 1440.44
broken

1440.72 --> 1445.52
and it's a man-made device like a

1443.6 --> 1449.6399999999999
man-made device what it

1445.52 --> 1449.6399999999999
does that's not a natural

1450.919 --> 1457.24
phenomenon do I hate full moons no not

1455.08 --> 1459.72
necessarily but when I'm kind of like in

1457.24 --> 1464.84
an unstable phase they can

1459.72 --> 1464.84
be very stressful for me

1480.88 --> 1485.88
and I do feel like I'm growing out of

1482.72 --> 1485.88
the unstable phase

1485.96 --> 1491.24
though like I feel a little bit like I

1488.679 --> 1494.039
all I'm noticing is that like say a week

1491.24 --> 1496.919
ago I would just feel like even in my

1494.039 --> 1499.44
face like it just feels like life has

1496.919 --> 1502.6000000000001
left me or something ter terrible

1499.44 --> 1504.799
sensation I feel a little bit more alive

1502.6 --> 1504.799
right

1505.799 --> 1511.1589999999999
now was it proven to be broke

1511.96 --> 1519.279
Gary like in the warranties and all that

1516.279 --> 1523.159
of a gyroscope when you buy

1519.279 --> 1526.399
it it's very likely to say like hey if

1523.159 --> 1530.3200000000002
it's drifting or anything else like

1526.399 --> 1530.32
that's considered a production area

1532.76 --> 1538.36
eror the point is about a gyroscope is

1535.96 --> 1543.3990000000001
it's not supposed to drift so if it's

1538.36 --> 1543.399
drift that would logically mean it's

1544.08 --> 1547.08
broken

1553.24 --> 1559.279
yeah Mo only no dber they don't

1561.159 --> 1565.3200000000002
what's the second one broken

1566.24 --> 1570.32
two I don't know what you're talking

1583.2 --> 1589.1200000000001
about I mean it's

1586.24 --> 1591.559
not unheard of to have more than one

1589.12 --> 1591.559
broken

1608.96 --> 1614.32
gyroscope they had two yeah well they

1612.12 --> 1616.84
they can they can have two gyroscopes

1614.32 --> 1620.559
and they drift and well a gyroscope is

1616.84 --> 1624.9189999999999
not supposed to drift it's drifting it's

1620.559 --> 1624.9189999999999
not functioning properly according to

1627.2 --> 1631.48
Specs L JD is

1639.6 --> 1646.039
here can everybody here please don't

1642.0 --> 1646.039
forget the Rogan it up

1650.12 --> 1653.6789999999999
would be pissed if you wasted 20K on

1652.44 --> 1656.3600000000001
something that was

1653.679 --> 1660.0800000000002
broken unless you were specifically

1656.36 --> 1660.08
looking for that

1685.519 --> 1690.159
all right but look within the man-made

1688.24 --> 1693.48
device of I think it was

1690.159 --> 1696.0390000000002
a ring laser gyroscope something like

1693.48 --> 1698.919
that it's the claim that there is an

1696.039 --> 1702.24
alleged light drift that

1698.919 --> 1705.3990000000001
causes some deviation a consistent

1702.24 --> 1705.3990000000001
deviation but I

1705.799 --> 1711.519
mean that's not a solid found for a

1708.88 --> 1711.519
scientific

1717.559 --> 1722.24
argument I need to stop brushing things

1720.2 --> 1725.3990000000001
under the carpet okay well I'm not

1722.24 --> 1725.3990000000001
brushing anything under the

1727.2 --> 1733.64
carpet so you don't need to speak for me

1730.12 --> 1733.6399999999999
with the we there Gary

1737.039 --> 1741.08
f for

1745.14 --> 1748.199
[Music]

1752.52 --> 1756.02
[Music]

1776.84 --> 1783.9189999999999
strange how it was 15° and not any other

1780.159 --> 1783.919
number yeah I'm sure it

1787.559 --> 1794.8799999999999
is but I mean it's still happening in a

1790.48 --> 1794.88
man-made device I mean

1799.399 --> 1806.4799999999998
technology is going to have some strange

1802.72 --> 1808.64
phenomena that that just

1806.48 --> 1812.3600000000001
happened but it's not a natural

1808.64 --> 1812.3600000000001
phenomena it's not you

1812.64 --> 1816.72
can't you can't use that

1824.279 --> 1829.679
scientifically cuz it's the alternative

1827.36 --> 1831.9599999999998
is oh really what is the alternative

1829.679 --> 1831.96
Gary

1832.88 --> 1839.3990000000001
F sounds like you're stuck in a false

1835.6 --> 1839.399
dichotomy there

1862.399 --> 1866.36
I wish you jumped into Flat Earth

1867.44 --> 1872.3600000000001
2016 yeah those were very exciting

1873.96 --> 1878.799
times how do you measure something

1876.519 --> 1878.799
without

1879.36 --> 1884.4799999999998
a

1881.559 --> 1889.6789999999999
um it's not about the measuring it it's

1884.48 --> 1889.679
about the phenomenon occurring

1890.36 --> 1893.9189999999999
the phenomenon has to occur without a

1892.799 --> 1896.1589999999999
man-made

1893.919 --> 1899.48
device to perceive

1896.159 --> 1905.679
it and then you can use a man-made

1899.48 --> 1908.3990000000001
device to gather data about the natural

1905.679 --> 1910.96
phenomenon but if you don't even know

1908.399 --> 1914.12
the phenomenon exists until you make a

1910.96 --> 1917.1200000000001
man-made device well then the natural

1914.12 --> 1920.799
phenomenon isn't natural it's happening

1917.12 --> 1920.799
within from within the man-made

1930.88 --> 1936.5590000000002
device all

1932.639 --> 1939.9599999999998
right first you need to perceive the

1936.559 --> 1943.519
natural phenomenon in nature then you

1939.96 --> 1948.679
can use man-made device to size it up

1943.519 --> 1948.679
measure it all that

1949.639 --> 1953.4399999999998
can't just say like oh I have a

1951.399 --> 1955.559
suspicion there's something there but I

1953.44 --> 1957.799
I I don't I'm not perceiving it I'm not

1955.559 --> 1959.72
reading it I'm going to make a man-made

1957.799 --> 1962.36
device Oh look The man-made device

1959.72 --> 1965.799
reveals exactly what I thought well

1962.36 --> 1965.799
that's not a natural phenomenon

1976.279 --> 1984.519
then I can't just just say they were

1979.36 --> 1984.519
broken what because they cost a lot of

1985.039 --> 1990.639
money I'm pretty damn sure that

1988.159 --> 1992.7990000000002
espcially expensive

1990.639 --> 1997.4399999999998
equipment

1992.799 --> 2000.96
is like concerning a gyroscope is meant

1997.44 --> 2003.24
to to not drift I mean that's the entire

2000.96 --> 2004.48
function of a gyroscope is that it

2003.24 --> 2007.48
doesn't

2004.48 --> 2010.3600000000001
drift that's what makes it a reliable

2007.48 --> 2010.3600000000001
tool to of

2012.799 --> 2019.84
reference like in Engineering

2017.159 --> 2022.6390000000001
in in

2019.84 --> 2025.639
technology I mean it's right there in

2022.639 --> 2028.399
your face like what do you use a

2025.639 --> 2028.399
gyroscope

2030.76 --> 2036.36
for to keep that absolute stable

2034.32 --> 2039.0
reference frame in relation to

2036.36 --> 2040.519
everything else that might be moving

2039.0 --> 2044.85
well if it's going to drift well then

2040.519 --> 2049.19
it's not performing what it's designed

2044.85 --> 2049.19
[Music]

2051.399 --> 2056.6389999999997
for if a manmade device measure

2054.32 --> 2059.48
something then that something exists to

2056.639 --> 2059.48
be measured

2060.32 --> 2068.44
no that just means that a man-made

2063.879 --> 2071.0
device seems to measure something that

2068.44 --> 2075.28
exists only because the man-made device

2071.0 --> 2078.24
is there to pick up on it like the

2075.28 --> 2080.48
phenomenon is then logically caused by

2078.24 --> 2080.4799999999996
the

2084.919 --> 2092.72
device where did I read Gyros I'm not

2089.28 --> 2092.7200000000003
even are you

2096.04 --> 2103.68
DED document ation

2100.24 --> 2106.04
like I'm not going to get into that

2103.68 --> 2106.04
that's

2123.079 --> 2129.6400000000003
ridiculous the whole point of a

2125.32 --> 2129.6400000000003
gyroscope is that it doesn't drift

2133.359 --> 2139.56
right really primitive ones

2135.839 --> 2143.16
might because of their imperfection the

2139.56 --> 2145.599
the entire point of a

2143.16 --> 2148.5989999999997
gyroscope for it to function

2145.599 --> 2152.3590000000004
technologically what it is used for is

2148.599 --> 2154.92
that it doesn't drift that's the point

2152.359 --> 2154.92
of the

2155.92 --> 2162.48
device presupposed in no you're a nut

2159.319 --> 2166.4
case and you're out of

2162.48 --> 2166.4
here come back in 30

2170.56 --> 2177.24
minutes I'm not going to let you spam

2172.88 --> 2177.2400000000002
your hor [ __ ] in my chat

2203.04 --> 2208.599
red the star sun and moon were believed

2205.96 --> 2211.56
to move through yeah sure there's a lot

2208.599 --> 2212.92
of things believed concerning ether I

2211.56 --> 2218.64
mean it doesn't

2212.92 --> 2218.64
really amount to any proof though duper

2221.48 --> 2226.0
Wikipedia article yeah right

2290.04 --> 2295.319
right and I

2292.48 --> 2299.2
mean saying the gyro didn't drift

2295.319 --> 2303.2
something underneath it

2299.2 --> 2303.2
that's no

2307.599 --> 2313.7200000000003
that's a gyro isn't supposed to

2310.72 --> 2317.64
drift gyroscopes Don't Drift if they

2313.72 --> 2317.64
work properly they ATT tuned

2319.48 --> 2324.76
properly right but if like a gyroscope

2323.4 --> 2327.119
is

2324.76 --> 2330.1600000000003
installed in a plane or something and

2327.119 --> 2333.079
the plane wants to keep exactly

2330.16 --> 2335.2799999999997
level yeah if it's then going to take a

2333.079 --> 2338.6400000000003
dive or turn a

2335.28 --> 2342.0
corner then the gyroscope will will

2338.64 --> 2344.04
show in relation to the plane of drift

2342.0 --> 2346.2
because the gyroscope is going to keep

2344.04 --> 2350.119
perfectly rigid while the plane that

2346.2 --> 2355.24
surrounds it is

2350.119 --> 2357.76
rotating that's why they have

2355.24 --> 2362.319
gyroscopes it's there to show you the

2357.76 --> 2362.3190000000004
orientation in relation to ukian

2362.56 --> 2369.359
space to give you your orientation

2365.16 --> 2369.359
they're not supposed to drift

2379.319 --> 2384.68
right and yes there's the issue of

2382.04 --> 2386.52
course with oh the globe earth oh the

2384.68 --> 2391.0789999999997
globe is

2386.52 --> 2393.079
spinning yeah gyroscopes prove that the

2391.079 --> 2396.319
Earth isn't

2393.079 --> 2398.92
spitting cuz technologically they

2396.319 --> 2400.44
shouldn't drift you spin up a gyroscope

2398.92 --> 2404.0
it shouldn't

2400.44 --> 2408.119
drift and it doesn't if it works

2404.0 --> 2408.119
properly which means the Earth is

2408.599 --> 2411.599
stationary

2413.44 --> 2418.04
right because if it was a spinning ball

2415.96 --> 2421.0
well then the gyroscope should drift

2418.04 --> 2425.119
very consistently also

2421.0 --> 2427.64
based the rotation of it should

2425.119 --> 2429.48
reveal like where you are on the

2427.64 --> 2433.64
presupposed spinning

2429.48 --> 2437.48
ball because it's going to rotate in

2433.64 --> 2440.52
relation to the axis of the Earth the

2437.48 --> 2440.52
supposed spinning

2440.56 --> 2445.96
axis right so at the North Pole in the

2443.64 --> 2449.0
South Pole it would

2445.96 --> 2452.7200000000003
rotate perpendicular to the Earth's

2449.0 --> 2454.92
surface and at the equator it

2452.72 --> 2459.839
would

2454.92 --> 2461.56
rotate 90° it would drift like that but

2459.839 --> 2464.64
it doesn't do

2461.56 --> 2468.56
that there's no recording

2464.64 --> 2470.96
of a gyroscope that drifts in that

2468.56 --> 2474.16
fashion whenever there's any kind of

2470.96 --> 2479.92
drift which is logically due to

2474.16 --> 2482.24
Mechanical failure it always drifts

2479.92 --> 2485.76
perpendicular to the

2482.24 --> 2488.3999999999996
surface including near the

2485.76 --> 2492.1600000000003
equator so

2488.4 --> 2492.1600000000003
there's definitely no earth spin

2494.28 --> 2497.7200000000003
happening Earth is

2499.68 --> 2504.48
stationary why wouldn't gra wouldn't

2502.64 --> 2507.52
gravity keep

2504.48 --> 2510.48
no the whole point about a gyroscope

2507.52 --> 2514.319
that is that it isn't going to be

2510.48 --> 2518.2400000000002
changed altered subjected to any

2514.319 --> 2523.24
forces like you can actually subject a

2518.24 --> 2526.5989999999997
gyroscope to proven forces which gravity

2523.24 --> 2528.68
is not you can like throw it you can do

2526.599 --> 2533.4
all kinds of things with it and the

2528.68 --> 2535.96
gyroscope will still remain rigid in its

2533.4 --> 2538.48
orientation in idian

2535.96 --> 2540.319
space that's the whole function the

2538.48 --> 2545.2
function is that no matter how many

2540.319 --> 2547.92
forces you sh subjected to it it retains

2545.2 --> 2550.72
its orientation that's the end entire

2547.92 --> 2550.7200000000003
point of the

2551.72 --> 2558.72
device so no gravity does not

2556.04 --> 2561.319
change anything presupposed Gravity

2558.72 --> 2564.839
Force doesn't change anything about a

2561.319 --> 2568.119
gyroscope no force does even very strong

2564.839 --> 2571.0
forces wouldn't do that other than

2568.119 --> 2571.0
smashing the

2576.119 --> 2580.1600000000003
device for

2582.8 --> 2586.079
[Music]

2636.8 --> 2640.079
right for

2667.2 --> 2672.68
okay that's that's just rude I get a

2670.0 --> 2672.68
time out for

2673.8 --> 2679.44
that yeah gravity is not things falling

2682.28 --> 2689.6800000000003
down well it's claimed to be that but I

2685.44 --> 2693.4
mean gravity is not even a theory it's

2689.68 --> 2697.3999999999996
bunk Mass doesn't attract

2693.4 --> 2698.2000000000003
Mass whatever mass is

2697.4 --> 2703.0
yeah

2698.2 --> 2704.2
and things solid things may fall down

2703.0 --> 2708.2
within the

2704.2 --> 2710.1189999999997
air because they are more dense than the

2708.2 --> 2713.7599999999998
medium that surrounds it it's called

2710.119 --> 2716.559
relative density or density Theory and

2713.76 --> 2719.92
that is scientifically

2716.559 --> 2724.96
proven and that is the reason why

2719.92 --> 2724.96
objects fall down to the Earth

2728.88 --> 2736.6800000000003
and other things that are arguably

2731.92 --> 2736.6800000000003
lighter than air less dense than air go

2749.079 --> 2754.1600000000003
up

2751.079 --> 2757.7200000000003
okay yeah that's right rich I mean Earth

2754.16 --> 2757.72
is not spinning

2758.119 --> 2761.44
there's no Coralis

2766.319 --> 2772.44
deviation right Air does not attain

2770.2 --> 2773.4399999999996
momentum it responds to local air

2772.44 --> 2775.559
pressure

2773.44 --> 2777.44
differential pressure differential is

2775.559 --> 2780.96
the only thing that

2777.44 --> 2784.52
really air responds to you can't build

2780.96 --> 2788.8
up momentum with air it can only be

2784.52 --> 2791.559
continue to be pushed forth by more

2788.8 --> 2793.44
pressure as soon as that pressure then

2791.559 --> 2796.96
is

2793.44 --> 2800.16
equalized it goes back to Steel cuz

2796.96 --> 2804.04
that's what air does that's what gases

2800.16 --> 2807.1189999999997
do can throw a bit of air and then it

2804.04 --> 2811.119
will keep its momentum from the throw it

2807.119 --> 2811.119
doesn't do that balloons don't do

2814.24 --> 2820.359
that right liquids if you fill a balloon

2818.0 --> 2822.359
with water then it will do that because

2820.359 --> 2825.4
the water does retain momentum and if

2822.359 --> 2828.16
you throw a rock it will keep on flying

2825.4 --> 2831.4
because it retains momentum if you just

2828.16 --> 2833.04
have the balloon filled with air it

2831.4 --> 2836.319
doesn't you throw it and then it

2833.04 --> 2836.319
immediately slows

2837.68 --> 2842.72
down because it doesn't attain momentum

2841.04 --> 2846.92
the rubber attains a little bit of

2842.72 --> 2850.7999999999997
momentum but the air within it does not

2846.92 --> 2850.8
and just grinds it down to a

2850.88 --> 2858.88
halt and then it will just

2854.2 --> 2858.8799999999997
move in accordance to the relative

2862.2 --> 2868.359
density right that's how air behaves so

2866.8 --> 2871.0
if the Earth were

2868.359 --> 2875.44
spinning then the air would never be

2871.0 --> 2877.359
perceived to be still at any

2875.44 --> 2879.599
point because the the Earth would be

2877.359 --> 2883.04
spinning underneath it

2879.599 --> 2886.6400000000003
and the air would be standing still in

2883.04 --> 2890.2799999999997
relation to that spinning Earth making

2886.64 --> 2892.8799999999997
it seem to Blow The Wind would be

2890.28 --> 2896.52
blowing in relation to the Earth

2892.88 --> 2896.52
continually and in One

2896.96 --> 2902.8
Direction and it isn't there is plenty

2900.559 --> 2905.4
of times where the wind is

2902.8 --> 2908.76
still and that could never happen on a

2905.4 --> 2908.76
on a ball Earth that's finin

2934.079 --> 2937.079
h

2942.319 --> 2946.16
right I'm getting kind of hungry going

2944.079 --> 2949.6800000000003
to put my little not to C on in the oven

2946.16 --> 2949.68
and get my coffee I'll be right

2965.72 --> 2968.72
back

2995.64 --> 2999.68
for for

3031.72 --> 3039.5989999999997
some interesting ideas you have who who

3036.4 --> 3039.599
you talking to debatable

3055.64 --> 3059.5989999999997
d for

3062.13 --> 3065.2690000000002
[Music]

3105.559 --> 3109.6800000000003
right so yeah don't forget to rogans it

3107.44 --> 3113.76
up

3109.68 --> 3117.0
again and if you like my

3113.76 --> 3121.6400000000003
shows please donate to my PayPal become

3117.0 --> 3121.64
part of my patreon to keep me

3126.599 --> 3133.1600000000003
supported and yeah get in the chat and

3130.88 --> 3135.6800000000003
discuss with me I guess today we're

3133.16 --> 3137.96
discussing a little bit of Flat Earth I

3135.68 --> 3139.96
also wanted to discuss the ether

3137.96 --> 3142.64
situation but I mean

3139.96 --> 3145.64
it's more difficult to

3142.64 --> 3149.1189999999997
discuss I know some people have beliefs

3145.64 --> 3150.72
about it like seeking star water but I

3149.119 --> 3154.599
mean those beliefs

3150.72 --> 3156.9599999999996
are separate from the

3154.599 --> 3161.2000000000003
general ether

3156.96 --> 3162.44
claim CU in that sense I have some ether

3161.2 --> 3166.359
beliefs

3162.44 --> 3169.599
myself I just don't think it relates to

3166.359 --> 3173.359
all things and especially

3169.599 --> 3175.0
light doesn't apply to that at all I

3173.359 --> 3179.319
think

3175.0 --> 3182.4
there's some spiritual or information

3179.319 --> 3186.319
based ether

3182.4 --> 3190.52
potentially like the akashic

3186.319 --> 3190.52
library arguably could

3191.88 --> 3199.2400000000002
be considered like an ether almost like

3195.599 --> 3203.44
a field that connects us through like

3199.24 --> 3203.4399999999996
outside of normal physical

3203.599 --> 3208.319
space I mean if I can

3207.079 --> 3210.599
apply the

3208.319 --> 3214.52
technique without being in direct

3210.599 --> 3217.28
contact over it an unknown

3214.52 --> 3220.72
distance

3217.28 --> 3223.52
then well something has to like somehow

3220.72 --> 3223.52
bridge that

3224.24 --> 3230.2799999999997
distance right but not any physical

3228.2 --> 3234.3999999999996
substance like

3230.28 --> 3237.2400000000002
light or electricity because or magnetic

3234.4 --> 3240.64
field because like how is that how is my

3237.24 --> 3246.319
personal little magnetic field going to

3240.64 --> 3248.5989999999997
bridge Like A Thousand Miles like that

3246.319 --> 3251.0
right if you're going to approach it

3248.599 --> 3253.2400000000002
from within physics then you need an

3251.0 --> 3255.599
amount of energy build up which would be

3253.24 --> 3257.3999999999996
very palpable to then technically bridge

3255.599 --> 3258.92
that distance and that's not really

3257.4 --> 3263.6800000000003
happening like

3258.92 --> 3263.6800000000003
that so there might be some other

3264.079 --> 3272.48
thing that connects us all

3267.079 --> 3272.48
in a way that goes outside of the

3273.079 --> 3278.6800000000003
physical right so a spiritual ether in

3277.72 --> 3282.2
that

3278.68 --> 3285.96
sense like or a spirit internet you

3282.2 --> 3288.799
might almost call it

3285.96 --> 3292.0
yeah which would be the same thing that

3288.799 --> 3294.92
might even like help telepathic traits

3292.0 --> 3297.839
and all that I think that that exists

3294.92 --> 3300.839
but I mean that's very

3297.839 --> 3300.839
distinctly

3300.88 --> 3305.0
nonscientific and non-physics

3307.799 --> 3312.319
related it really does kind of fall into

3310.599 --> 3317.4
the Paranormal

3312.319 --> 3320.2
category and I yeah other than like oh

3317.4 --> 3321.96
look I can prove it can be done well

3320.2 --> 3324.52
that doesn't prove anything about the

3321.96 --> 3324.52
nature of

3324.839 --> 3331.16
it other than hey you could do something

3329.16 --> 3333.44
and it'll have an influence on somebody

3331.16 --> 3336.799
else very far

3333.44 --> 3338.16
away and that works consistently and

3336.799 --> 3343.0389999999998
like that is

3338.16 --> 3343.0389999999998
it so it's almost like the same kind

3344.2 --> 3355.5989999999997
of test yield of information as would be

3350.2 --> 3355.5989999999997
like a lot of earlier experimental

3356.359 --> 3360.52
figuring out like how the how the Body

3358.599 --> 3362.76
Works how it can be repaired when

3360.52 --> 3365.839
damaged it's like oh well it just

3362.76 --> 3368.3590000000004
happens to be like this if we do this

3365.839 --> 3368.359
then it

3369.559 --> 3375.0
restores well that's not because you

3372.079 --> 3377.88
fully understand the total scope of the

3375.0 --> 3381.039
bodily function necessarily it's just

3377.88 --> 3383.96
like oh you just tested it when you do

3381.039 --> 3387.5200000000004
this there's a better chance that of

3383.96 --> 3390.52
recovery and then that's like becomes

3387.52 --> 3393.0389999999998
practical knowledge right so you can

3390.52 --> 3395.68
have like practical

3393.039 --> 3396.96
knowledge about like hey yeah we can do

3395.68 --> 3399.359
things at a

3396.96 --> 3400.68
distance that doesn't mean that you

3399.359 --> 3405.0789999999997
understand

3400.68 --> 3405.0789999999997
how that happens

3405.68 --> 3410.48
see so it's not scientific

3418.0 --> 3422.72
check it out

3419.64 --> 3425.96
later all the big foot oh okay you're

3422.72 --> 3429.9599999999996
like into Ken B are you

3425.96 --> 3429.96
GF whatever

3451.48 --> 3457.44
I like talking about ether it sends me

3453.96 --> 3457.44
to sleep

3460.839 --> 3468.599
okay yeah hey Gary a maybe maybe not do

3464.44 --> 3471.28
that how about you don't talk about

3468.599 --> 3476.599
Bigfoot we were talking about something

3471.28 --> 3479.2000000000003
very substantial here ether

3476.599 --> 3481.839
as a supposed scientific concept which

3479.2 --> 3486.2799999999997
it isn't and

3481.839 --> 3488.64
the mysterious things that would fall

3486.28 --> 3491.52
under the Paranormal that might indicate

3488.64 --> 3491.52
that there is some

3492.079 --> 3497.599
connecting field somehow that isn't

3498.24 --> 3502.68
physical isn't that interesting you

3500.52 --> 3506.64
certainly have to talk about Bigfoot is

3502.68 --> 3506.64
something completely different

3516.4 --> 3522.44
hey you didn't bring it up yeah but

3517.92 --> 3522.44
you're certainly like talking on about

3523.64 --> 3528.2
it

3525.2 --> 3528.2
just

3529.52 --> 3534.88
don't yeah I I don't want people to talk

3532.48 --> 3538.039
about Bigfoot in my chat like this has

3534.88 --> 3540.96
nothing to do with Bigfoot

3538.039 --> 3544.4
fo seems like you're trying to Poison

3540.96 --> 3544.4
the Well concerning the

3545.16 --> 3551.68
discussion yeah what I'm talking about

3548.52 --> 3555.359
physics very serious things I don't want

3551.68 --> 3557.2799999999997
you to bring up Bigfoot when I do that

3555.359 --> 3560.68
yeah that's called

3557.28 --> 3564.3190000000004
sabotage now discontinue or will kick

3560.68 --> 3567.5589999999997
you out don't do that don't discredit

3564.319 --> 3567.5589999999997
the subject

3576.24 --> 3581.7599999999998
yeah you want to do some Bigfoot [ __ ]

3578.559 --> 3584.559
well then go to a Bigfoot Channel don't

3581.76 --> 3584.559
talk about it

3586.799 --> 3592.0
here we're not talking about that you're

3589.52 --> 3595.0
not going to talk about that here you

3592.0 --> 3595.0
understand

3597.64 --> 3603.68
not now anyway cuz we're talking about

3600.16 --> 3603.68
serious things

3640.559 --> 3647.599
yeah gyroscope stay rigid in ukian space

3644.4 --> 3651.2400000000002
they're not supposed to drift if they

3647.599 --> 3656.079
drift then the gyroscope is not up to

3651.24 --> 3656.0789999999997
spec because it shouldn't drift

3658.079 --> 3660.92
because the Earth is

3661.559 --> 3667.1600000000003
stationary another a sphere if you'd

3664.4 --> 3670.1600000000003
move a gyroscope while moving over the

3667.16 --> 3672.72
Earth and the Earth would be a ball well

3670.16 --> 3676.5989999999997
then the gyroscope should

3672.72 --> 3679.64
drift not over time but over

3676.599 --> 3683.44
distance right theoretically you're on

3679.64 --> 3686.68
the ball in a super highspeed

3683.44 --> 3690.0
plane you have a gyroscope in there

3686.68 --> 3692.44
it's spinning it's stable then you make

3690.0 --> 3695.2
super speed you go

3692.44 --> 3698.799
supersonic you go into the distance very

3695.2 --> 3702.319
far well guess what the gyroscope should

3698.799 --> 3705.7599999999998
be right because you're moving over this

3702.319 --> 3708.16
sphere Earth which means your

3705.76 --> 3710.92
orientation within ukian space in

3708.16 --> 3713.0389999999998
relation to that sphere Earth should be

3710.92 --> 3716.16
moving and the gyroscope should be

3713.039 --> 3718.76
standing still exactly how it was

3716.16 --> 3721.5589999999997
doesn't do that though because the Earth

3718.76 --> 3721.559
is flat and

3723.039 --> 3729.7990000000004
stationary yeah gyroscopes Don't Drift

3726.599 --> 3733.799
normally over time and they don't drift

3729.799 --> 3733.799
when you move a distance over the

3734.119 --> 3738.48
Earth they stay perfectly

3739.039 --> 3745.44
rigid and they don't

3742.319 --> 3747.839
drift and when they do well they're

3745.44 --> 3747.839
broken

3757.119 --> 3761.359
it seems like not everybody's talking

3759.119 --> 3763.6800000000003
about the same ether well there's not

3761.359 --> 3767.24
really good ether

3763.68 --> 3771.1189999999997
theories it's mostly a collection

3767.24 --> 3773.2
of phenomena mostly derived from

3771.119 --> 3776.44
man-made

3773.2 --> 3782.16
devices not naturally occurring that

3776.44 --> 3784.599
have just been mashed up in a structure

3782.16 --> 3788.0
of rough

3784.599 --> 3791.76
correlation and sometimes not even

3788.0 --> 3796.039
correlation it's just a collection of

3791.76 --> 3798.4
little perceived things and

3796.039 --> 3800.92
misunderstandings I call it the wheelie

3798.4 --> 3804.559
can wheeler

3800.92 --> 3807.44
like develop that and it's been widely

3804.559 --> 3809.559
adopted by ether enthusiasts including

3807.44 --> 3812.68
wit it gets

3809.559 --> 3815.96
it it's a wheelie that's called a

3812.68 --> 3818.2
wheelie right but the wheelie also

3815.96 --> 3820.839
contains the

3818.2 --> 3823.48
Assumption about light being a wave and

3820.839 --> 3829.359
having a speed and therefore requiring a

3823.48 --> 3829.359
medium and that's all bunk that's all

3832.599 --> 3839.0
incorrect so the wheelie is founded on

3836.119 --> 3841.48
on multiple

3839.0 --> 3845.799
misunderstandings about the nature of

3841.48 --> 3847.48
light and tied in with some

3845.799 --> 3850.96
electric

3847.48 --> 3853.48
phenomenon that are blatantly only

3850.96 --> 3856.559
happening inside of man-made devices and

3853.48 --> 3856.559
that don't occur in

3857.16 --> 3863.839
nature

3858.76 --> 3867.079
and attached to some wide

3863.839 --> 3870.359
etheric conclusions

3867.079 --> 3873.6400000000003
and presupposition of Earth being a dis

3870.359 --> 3873.64
also it's tied into

3876.079 --> 3881.799
that it's like one assumption leads to

3879.64 --> 3885.72
another assumption leads to another

3881.799 --> 3885.72
assumption and that's

3886.799 --> 3894.839
ether right but there are many

3891.799 --> 3898.92
mysterious things in the world that fall

3894.839 --> 3900.7599999999998
outside of science that do give the

3898.92 --> 3903.64
suggestion that there is some kind of

3900.76 --> 3903.6400000000003
connecting

3907.279 --> 3912.44
thing but these things fall within the

3910.24 --> 3914.68
perview

3912.44 --> 3916.68
of

3914.68 --> 3920.799
information

3916.68 --> 3925.839
and conscious personal

3920.799 --> 3928.2
experiences and yeah you can't really

3925.839 --> 3931.64
solidify those you can't really

3928.2 --> 3935.3999999999996
experiment with those outside of

3931.64 --> 3939.48
people's experiences and

3935.4 --> 3942.799
psychology you can notice a tangible

3939.48 --> 3945.359
result like oh a person is stressed out

3942.799 --> 3947.279
and then oh somebody fixes that person

3945.359 --> 3950.16
at a distance even without them knowing

3947.279 --> 3954.039
about it and then there's something

3950.16 --> 3956.92
changed so you can see oh there's a a

3954.039 --> 3960.88
change and it's happening happening at

3956.92 --> 3963.2000000000003
a like at an at a crazy

3960.88 --> 3965.839
distance without the person even knowing

3963.2 --> 3967.359
about it so there's something happening

3965.839 --> 3970.319
but I mean that

3967.359 --> 3972.96
doesn't give any physical indication as

3970.319 --> 3975.4
to like how that is

3972.96 --> 3977.76
happening so there's something that

3975.4 --> 3981.44
seems to then connect them

3977.76 --> 3984.76
up to be able for that to

3981.44 --> 3986.64
happen but you could think of such a

3984.76 --> 3989.2000000000003
thing as like

3986.64 --> 3991.279
ether but that has nothing to do with

3989.2 --> 3993.799
all the other conclusions about the

3991.279 --> 3997.359
nature of light or

3993.799 --> 3997.359
electric electric

4006.68 --> 4013.1189999999997
phenomenon found documentation about

4009.24 --> 4017.1189999999997
Ring laser J there meant to

4013.119 --> 4017.119
drift okay

4024.279 --> 4028.96
oh regular physical gyroscopes aren't

4027.4 --> 4031.76
they're not supposed to

4028.96 --> 4032.559
drift so yeah maybe something with the

4031.76 --> 4035.5200000000004
ring

4032.559 --> 4038.6800000000003
lasers ring laser gyro that it is

4035.52 --> 4042.16
supposed to do that

4038.68 --> 4046.3999999999996
somehow that's kind of weird if it does

4042.16 --> 4046.3999999999996
but it sounds like that's

4046.44 --> 4050.76
a flaw within the man-made system

4064.4 --> 4068.31
then you were told that gyroscopes mimic

4067.52 --> 4071.34
Earth's

4068.31 --> 4071.34
[Music]

4072.16 --> 4077.48
stability I don't know exactly what he

4074.48 --> 4079.72
meant with that but I I would translate

4077.48 --> 4079.72
that

4080.92 --> 4087.039
is it remains rigid and

4084.88 --> 4090.6400000000003
stable in its

4087.039 --> 4094.119
orientation like the stationary

4090.64 --> 4097.4
Earth that's how I would interpret

4094.119 --> 4102.279
that can magnetic fields affect

4097.4 --> 4102.2789999999995
gyroscopes no I don't think so

4116.199 --> 4121.96
maybe to some degree if they disrupt the

4119.799 --> 4126.6
the systems I mean maybe ring laser

4121.96 --> 4130.56
garro could be influenced by magnetism

4126.6 --> 4130.56
somehow since it's a piece of

4133.44 --> 4136.719
technology with components in it that

4135.799 --> 4139.839
might

4136.719 --> 4142.52
be susceptible to that it might disrupt

4139.839 --> 4144.359
the elect electric functions

4142.52 --> 4147.6
whatever

4144.359 --> 4149.4800000000005
so I think a strong magnetic field would

4147.6 --> 4153.96
probably affect a

4149.48 --> 4153.959999999999
gyroscope like a ring laser type

4155.279 --> 4161.279
thing and maybe like a physical

4157.88 --> 4163.08
gyroscope if it was metal based you if

4161.279 --> 4167.679
with a strong enough magnet you could

4163.08 --> 4170.239
basically like force it to a halt or

4167.679 --> 4173.1990000000005
something Make It Stop spinning which is

4170.239 --> 4175.879999999999
an intrical function of the gyroscope

4173.199 --> 4178.5199999999995
but no

4175.88 --> 4183.64
normally the whole point about a a

4178.52 --> 4183.64
gyroscope is that it isn't influenced by

4188.0 --> 4195.319
forces bet your teach was a flat

4191.319 --> 4195.319
Earth Maybe

4197.12 --> 4201.04
or maybe he was just trying to be honest

4200.0 --> 4203.96
and

4201.04 --> 4208.12
correct which naturally becomes

4203.96 --> 4210.36
conflicting with the globe Earth model

4208.12 --> 4211.92
claims it doesn't necessarily mean that

4210.36 --> 4213.92
he has to be a flat earther it just

4211.92 --> 4215.76
means that like he just knows what he

4213.92 --> 4217.96
knows and he's just trying to be honest

4215.76 --> 4217.96
about

4218.76 --> 4222.4400000000005
it right anyway I'm going to get my

4220.76 --> 4228.280000000001
Illuminati kasan

4222.44 --> 4228.28
and coffee I'll be right back for

[Music]

4313.92 --> 4316.92
t

4319.239 --> 4327.32
teachers in school thir what Gary if

4323.32 --> 4329.239
dude no teacher that taught in the 30s

4327.32 --> 4332.639
is going to still be a

4329.239 --> 4335.638999999999
teacher in schools G that's kind of

4332.639 --> 4335.639
ridiculous

4348.32 --> 4351.28
60s and the

4364.679 --> 4368.85
80s it's a bit of a long stretch there

4367.92 --> 4370.4400000000005
but who

4368.85 --> 4373.8
[Music]

4370.44 --> 4377.36
knows right I mean in the 20th century

4373.8 --> 4379.84
still a lot of teachers just didn't buy

4377.36 --> 4383.44
into the

4379.84 --> 4386.6
whole science ball Earth enthusiasm at

4383.44 --> 4390.239
all they were like bracing against

4386.6 --> 4394.08
it only being forced by the curriculum

4390.239 --> 4394.08
standards and all that

4398.18 --> 4401.319
[Music]

4407.48 --> 4410.48
h

4444.199 --> 4451.678999999999
what s flat out

4448.04 --> 4454.8
video gyro by saying

4451.679 --> 4457.8
wow debatable that is

4454.8 --> 4457.8
the

4458.28 --> 4463.8
that's that sounds like a flat earther

4461.32 --> 4467.159
that's just not getting

4463.8 --> 4470.159000000001
it maybe a misinformation placement but

4467.159 --> 4470.159
it could just be an

4471.36 --> 4478.28
idiot yeah Flat Earth is not spinning

4475.76 --> 4483.08
and especially not around the North Pole

4478.28 --> 4483.08
I mean that's absolutely preposterous

4501.32 --> 4508.639
Earth is flat and

4504.32 --> 4508.639
stationary and contained

4521.33 --> 4524.46
[Music]

4525.639 --> 4531.639
no the cat has not been back why are you

4527.88 --> 4531.639
asking about that

4557.25 --> 4560.38
[Music]

4564.36 --> 4568.96
right anyway hope you guys

4566.28 --> 4572.639
are finding this interesting and

4568.96 --> 4577.08
educational I'm doing my best

4572.639 --> 4580.0
here you like cats okay well that one

4577.08 --> 4583.0
particular cat annoys the [ __ ] out of me

4580.0 --> 4586.04
cuz all he wants was

4583.0 --> 4588.84
food and he just like he doesn't respond

4586.04 --> 4591.4
to like signals like hey don't get here

4588.84 --> 4593.84
don't do that don't get in

4591.4 --> 4596.12
here the white cat is it was adorable

4593.84 --> 4596.12
yeah I

4601.679 --> 4605.88
agree but the white cat doesn't come

4604.08 --> 4607.48
walking in here through the balcony and

4605.88 --> 4610.639
all that

4607.48 --> 4611.718999999999
so you sometimes he comes visiting in

4610.639 --> 4614.08
the

4611.719 --> 4617.92
evening goes in front of the kitchen

4614.08 --> 4617.92
window m

4646.04 --> 4653.76
what if it if as a thought experiment it

4650.639 --> 4657.88
were rotating around the north

4653.76 --> 4660.88
po what would the outcome and

4657.88 --> 4665.08
consequence it would be ridiculous the

4660.88 --> 4667.159000000001
bble D seriously I mean there's a

4665.08 --> 4669.04
something moving that means that we're

4667.159 --> 4672.96
now on a rotating

4669.04 --> 4676.84
platform first off there would be coris

4672.96 --> 4676.84
deviation yeah

4678.0 --> 4683.719
and then second things especially the

4681.52 --> 4684.719
further away from the North Pole would

4683.719 --> 4686.4
be

4684.719 --> 4689.199
subjected

4686.4 --> 4692.5599999999995
to centripetal

4689.199 --> 4692.5599999999995
forces which they

4694.6 --> 4698.88
aren't like have you ever been in a

4699.28 --> 4703.92
centrifuge yeah if you're at the edge of

4701.84 --> 4707.719
it you're going to be pressed to the

4703.92 --> 4707.719
side that that is what you would

4708.32 --> 4714.84
experience like at the South Pole you

4711.12 --> 4718.28
would be pushed against the Dome or

4714.84 --> 4722.639
whatever at the edges against the ice

4718.28 --> 4725.159
wall yeah and by the way the oceans and

4722.639 --> 4727.639
everything which are subjected to

4725.159 --> 4729.759999999999
momentum they would also do that they

4727.639 --> 4732.639
would literally all flow off to the side

4729.76 --> 4736.8
you would end up in a

4732.639 --> 4740.8
centrifuge so despite their being land

4736.8 --> 4740.8
up until the center point

4742.12 --> 4748.84
yeah there is no way in hell that Flat

4746.12 --> 4751.84
Earth disc is spinning it's

4748.84 --> 4753.6
stationary yeah 15° an hour is an

4751.84 --> 4759.08
enormous

4753.6 --> 4759.08
amount the edge velocity is insane

4777.12 --> 4785.76
I thought if you had a yeah hey Thursday

4780.56 --> 4785.76
vegan [ __ ] off with your [ __ ] ferit

4791.679 --> 4800.4400000000005
talks don't bring that up here

4795.4 --> 4800.44
you got it do that again I'll kick you

4805.0 --> 4812.639
out last warning I I don't want any of

4808.84 --> 4816.52
you just just do this [ __ ] poking all

4812.639 --> 4819.159000000001
the time with these troll memes yeah

4816.52 --> 4823.1990000000005
piss off don't do that again or I will

4819.159 --> 4823.199
kick you out I don't care

4837.679 --> 4845.12
we're not talking about that and you're

4839.719 --> 4845.12
not going to talk about that here do you

4847.4 --> 4851.44
understand talking

4849.639 --> 4855.719
about

4851.44 --> 4858.199
mechanics the Earth gyroscope ether

4855.719 --> 4860.679
we're not talking about other things

4858.199 --> 4865.12
don't bring them

4860.679 --> 4867.88
up okay dude yeah that's right okay dude

4865.12 --> 4871.36
yeah anybody bring up another [ __ ]

4867.88 --> 4875.76
troll word which is what that is I kick

4871.36 --> 4875.759999999999
you out don't do that

4880.4 --> 4885.4
again no not calm down don't do that

4884.28 --> 4888.28
again

4885.4 --> 4892.239
no no back

4888.28 --> 4892.239
wordss just don't do that

4893.6 --> 4902.320000000001
again and don't pretend like it it was

4897.52 --> 4902.320000000001
nothing or just randomly yeah [ __ ]

4908.6 --> 4913.76
off don't bring it up ever

4919.18 --> 4922.299
[Music]

4934.199 --> 4940.0
yeah don't say okay don't say calm down

4936.92 --> 4942.4400000000005
dude just don't say anything continue

4940.0 --> 4948.199
the conversation and don't bring it back

4942.44 --> 4948.199
up I don't need any any response from

4968.56 --> 4974.88
you yeah fibs I mean the entire premise

4972.8 --> 4977.04
of ball Earth spinning ball Earth is

4974.88 --> 4980.0
ridiculous the entire

4977.04 --> 4985.08
thing I

4980.0 --> 4988.08
know okay and now you're gone bye told

4985.08 --> 4990.8
you not to talk back now you're gone

4988.08 --> 4993.639
yeah it's simple instructions guys

4990.8 --> 4994.320000000001
there's very simple instructions about

4993.639 --> 4999.32
the

4994.32 --> 5005.5199999999995
chat do what I say or get the [ __ ]

4999.32 --> 5005.5199999999995
out I don't care I don't care

5006.159 --> 5011.32
about your

5008.12 --> 5016.199
objections do what I say or get the [ __ ]

5011.32 --> 5016.199
out there is no in between

5028.18 --> 5031.469
[Music]

5045.679 --> 5049.2390000000005
yeah it is super dumb I know

5050.88 --> 5055.6
fiods it's just that all these claims

5053.96 --> 5058.84
are there to like

5055.6 --> 5062.159000000001
justify mostly Celestial

5058.84 --> 5067.159000000001
sites but like the physics

5062.159 --> 5067.159
consequences for it is just completely

5068.719 --> 5075.2390000000005
intable if you hold a baller to task

5072.08 --> 5076.48
about the consequences of their claims

5075.239 --> 5081.28
about the

5076.48 --> 5081.28
Earth it just completely melts

5087.199 --> 5093.638999999999
down and Ballers if they really even

5090.679 --> 5095.88
take the effort for it will start to end

5093.639 --> 5099.04
up or yeah they will start and

5095.88 --> 5103.08
eventually end up like

5099.04 --> 5105.84
denying proven physics and and natural

5103.08 --> 5109.4
law in order to justify things they will

5105.84 --> 5113.96
tell you oh air does have momentum

5109.4 --> 5113.96
oh entropy doesn't apply to the

5118.6 --> 5123.159000000001
Earth all kinds of crazy statements just

5122.08 --> 5125.96
to

5123.159 --> 5128.879999999999
justify the the idea of the model that

5125.96 --> 5131.719
was really only conjured to justify

5128.88 --> 5131.719
Celestial

5134.56 --> 5139.639
sightings right to give a response to

5137.119 --> 5142.599999999999
the celestial sightings and the claims

5139.639 --> 5145.28
about them being

5142.6 --> 5147.92
bodies that's why it's constructed but

5145.28 --> 5153.5199999999995
then the on the earth physical

5147.92 --> 5153.52
consequences of the justification

5154.6 --> 5160.76
re bottles of ball Earth just becomes

5158.159 --> 5160.759999999999
completely

5162.6 --> 5168.76
intable all right anyway I'm going to

5164.56 --> 5168.76
take a bite of this shars

5198.92 --> 5205.4800000000005
does Spin and rotation have different

5200.84 --> 5205.4800000000005
meanings uh not that I know

5212.4 --> 5217.799999999999
of although intuitively I'd say that

5218.84 --> 5226.159000000001
spin really applies to things

5222.719 --> 5229.44
that like really spin

5226.159 --> 5232.04
around like more than 360° and would

5229.44 --> 5238.48
have an axis well

5232.04 --> 5238.48
while a rotation could simply be a turn

5244.88 --> 5250.4800000000005
although it would also like turn around

5247.44 --> 5253.08
an axis logically because any spin or

5250.48 --> 5256.119
rotation does but I mean I don't think

5253.08 --> 5259.08
there's really a

5256.119 --> 5261.32
literal clearcut difference between Spin

5259.08 --> 5261.32
and

5264.92 --> 5269.88
rotation hey clutch good to see you

5272.25 --> 5275.42
[Music]

5332.76 --> 5336.04
don't measure it

5338.36 --> 5344.92
well when you define spins you go per

5342.0 --> 5346.96
revolutions per second that kind of

5344.92 --> 5352.6
thing but I

5346.96 --> 5352.6
mean the whole is still subjected to

5352.92 --> 5359.52
forces centripetal forces and all that

5357.08 --> 5362.32
and there is a measured speed from

5359.52 --> 5364.280000000001
certain points of the thing that is

5362.32 --> 5365.84
spinning

5364.28 --> 5368.88
and that would be

5365.84 --> 5371.88
expressed in miles per hour or whatever

5368.88 --> 5371.88
so

5408.08 --> 5412.32
by the way that must be one hell of a

5409.88 --> 5412.32
record

5412.8 --> 5416.159000000001
player very

5416.88 --> 5424.8
vast if any part of the record would go

5420.8 --> 5424.8
70,600 milph

5428.44 --> 5433.5599999999995
I mean that's an insanely vast record

5447.04 --> 5452.719
then it's a very strange example to

5449.96 --> 5452.719
bring up Gary

5452.92 --> 5456.96
a for

5485.92 --> 5489.719
do the math or

5497.239 --> 5504.5599999999995
no yeah I'm not here to solve random

5501.32 --> 5506.759999999999
math problems that are being put down in

5504.56 --> 5506.76
the

5512.84 --> 5516.88
chat for

5560.6 --> 5565.320000000001
using

5562.239 --> 5569.119
Cutlery what to eat a croissant why the

5565.32 --> 5569.119
hell would I do that

5574.6 --> 5578.92
how about just sticking to the subjects

5576.639 --> 5578.92
at

5581.28 --> 5585.4
hand give it to Brian he'll tell you why

5583.719 --> 5588.32
don't you give it to

5585.4 --> 5592.0
Brian yeah I'm not interested in solving

5588.32 --> 5592.0
your math problems

5597.77 --> 5601.709000000001
[Music]

5612.44 --> 5617.08
no it won't save me from licking my

5615.08 --> 5619.44
greasy what the hell are you talking

5617.08 --> 5622.119
about are you just going to be here

5619.44 --> 5624.5199999999995
complaining and whiny cuz I'll kick you

5622.119 --> 5627.679
the hell out

5624.52 --> 5631.4800000000005
yeah if you don't like me eating my

5627.679 --> 5635.36
Illuminati every [ __ ] day then get

5631.48 --> 5635.36
the hell out of here

5635.44 --> 5640.48
yeah or don't watch the screen just

5637.92 --> 5640.4800000000005
listen

5641.08 --> 5647.04
then math is demonic no that's nonsense

5672.4 --> 5680.04
okay oh bye bye [ __ ] withit if you want

5677.56 --> 5684.6
to whine about me eating on the show

5680.04 --> 5688.36
which I have been doing for like

5684.6 --> 5690.719
forever almost every show well your

5688.36 --> 5695.639
[ __ ] problem then you get the hell

5690.719 --> 5695.639
out of here don't talk to me yeah

5698.28 --> 5705.4
I'm not here to resolve your complaints

5701.239 --> 5705.4
about how I do my show

5723.34 --> 5726.59
[Music]

5753.4 --> 5755.638999999999
h

5759.76 --> 5763.4400000000005
did hit the spot though that was very

5782.56 --> 5786.56
nice for

5814.76 --> 5819.4800000000005
okay expanding for it if you're just

5816.44 --> 5821.839999999999
here to ridicule I will kick you out

5819.48 --> 5824.199
yeah I don't care about your equating

5821.84 --> 5825.719
math with witchcraft and all that it's

5824.199 --> 5829.36
not

5825.719 --> 5832.719
funny yeah I don't see it as witchcraft

5829.36 --> 5835.96
I'm just not

5832.719 --> 5838.04
interested you got it I'm not here to

5835.96 --> 5842.719
solve your math

5838.04 --> 5844.76
problems I don't do math I don't care I

5842.719 --> 5849.4
don't need it

5844.76 --> 5849.400000000001
and I'm not going to entertain your math

5852.4 --> 5859.0
problems yeah go to somebody that's

5855.6 --> 5859.0
interested I am

5861.4 --> 5867.28
not yeah I don't need math to do my

5865.0 --> 5870.52
explaining as I

5867.28 --> 5873.8
have as I have done so for like one and

5870.52 --> 5876.4400000000005
a half hour already

5873.8 --> 5879.76
yeah I didn't need math to explain

5876.44 --> 5883.919999999999
anything and I won't need math to

5879.76 --> 5883.92
explain anything it's

5889.0 --> 5892.599
Superfluous yeah I don't

5896.239 --> 5902.0
care I don't care for your teachers

5899.0 --> 5902.0
nicknames

5926.76 --> 5933.92
yeah the Earth is flat and stationary

5930.76 --> 5936.679
and contained

5933.92 --> 5939.679
it's not spinning there's no coris

5936.679 --> 5943.08
deviation air doesn't move in lock step

5939.679 --> 5946.08
with a presupposed

5943.08 --> 5946.08
movement

5948.88 --> 5955.119
yeah because air doesn't build momentum

5952.04 --> 5958.239
it just doesn't it can if it has to move

5955.119 --> 5961.32
with something then it has to be pushed

5958.239 --> 5964.08
forth by container wall or continually

5961.32 --> 5966.04
increasing pressure which is not durable

5964.08 --> 5967.04
mostly by container walls and then it

5966.04 --> 5972.0
will

5967.04 --> 5975.92
keep sticking to the container

5972.0 --> 5978.48
wall like it will literally form a

5975.92 --> 5980.56
gradient with the container wall as it

5978.48 --> 5982.879999999999
is being pressed that that is what will

5980.56 --> 5986.360000000001
happen I mean that's one of

5982.88 --> 5989.32
the uh the things that like play into

5986.36 --> 5991.759999999999
the idea of upward Rising

5989.32 --> 5993.759999999999
Earth is that yeah well maybe the

5991.76 --> 5996.96
gradient is caused because it's upward

5993.76 --> 6000.119000000001
Rising because air doesn't attain

5996.96 --> 6002.76
momentum and so it would then be wanting

6000.119 --> 6005.08
to stick to Earth and the Earth

6002.76 --> 6007.88
container side that's going upward

6005.08 --> 6010.639
pressing against it causing more

6007.88 --> 6014.119
pressure at the surface than on the

6010.639 --> 6016.08
other side it's one way to explain it I

6014.119 --> 6018.598999999999
it's one way to explain it doesn't mean

6016.08 --> 6021.199
that that is the case I think there's a

6018.599 --> 6023.119000000001
very logical alternative that explains

6021.199 --> 6025.44
the gradient within the container of the

6023.119 --> 6029.08
real and that is

6025.44 --> 6032.159
temperature Heat at ground level cold at

6029.08 --> 6034.599
the top it is colder at the top

6032.159 --> 6036.96
measurably and it is warmer at the

6034.599 --> 6040.1990000000005
ground level and that

6036.96 --> 6043.0
is way more likely to be the cause of

6040.199 --> 6046.32
the gradiation of the gas and not an

6043.0 --> 6050.639
upward motion but

6046.32 --> 6054.119
motion of a container does create

6050.639 --> 6055.84
gradiation to a degree because air gases

6054.119 --> 6059.88
don't attain momentum they're not going

6055.84 --> 6061.88
to stabilize within the motion with its

6059.88 --> 6064.4800000000005
containment they're going to want to

6061.88 --> 6067.08
stay no matter what where they were in

6064.48 --> 6071.48
ukian

6067.08 --> 6075.239
space and thus they will basically press

6071.48 --> 6077.718999999999
a little against the side

6075.239 --> 6081.0
from from where they're coming from

6077.719 --> 6081.0
where the motion is coming

6081.199 --> 6086.199
from yeah something keeps pushing

6083.679 --> 6087.76
against the air there's going to be at

6086.199 --> 6089.04
that side that's pushing against it

6087.76 --> 6093.0
there's going to be a little bit more

6089.04 --> 6093.0
pressure that happens

6093.719 --> 6100.4
yeah what does not happen is that air is

6097.32 --> 6101.92
like oh well you're constantly moving

6100.4 --> 6103.879999999999
I'm just going to give up and I'm just

6101.92 --> 6104.679
going to go with the with the flow with

6103.88 --> 6109.0
the

6104.679 --> 6109.0
momentum and therefore you don't

6109.52 --> 6114.76
see the air moving continually because

6112.52 --> 6117.159000000001
of Corel this deviation because it moves

6114.76 --> 6120.2390000000005
in lock step yeah air doesn't do that

6117.159 --> 6124.08
gases don't do that they don't attain

6120.239 --> 6127.08
momentum they stay still in ukian space

6124.08 --> 6129.199
they respond to local air pressure

6127.08 --> 6132.0
differential increase pressure that

6129.199 --> 6136.239
wants to then equalize makes it

6132.0 --> 6141.8
move and it can only really be pushed

6136.239 --> 6141.799999999999
forward by a container wall

6146.639 --> 6153.52
coris is a bag of

6149.36 --> 6156.639
wind now coris is an apparent

6153.52 --> 6160.0
deviation because of

6156.639 --> 6164.599
a change of

6160.0 --> 6164.599
perspective yeah from a moving reference

6166.679 --> 6171.56
frame from the perspective of the thing

6169.48 --> 6174.239
that is moving it may seem like

6171.56 --> 6177.4400000000005
everything else is the thing that is

6174.239 --> 6180.0
moving and not you when it is when it is

6177.44 --> 6180.0
you that is

6180.719 --> 6187.44
moving right on spinning ball Earth the

6184.239 --> 6188.959999999999
air would stay still and the Earth would

6187.44 --> 6191.239
spin underneath it and if you're

6188.96 --> 6194.4
standing on the earth well then you

6191.239 --> 6196.4
might mistake it because of the

6194.4 --> 6199.96
confusion of it

6196.4 --> 6203.5199999999995
mistake the wind blowing in relation to

6199.96 --> 6205.0
you as that the air was moving but it's

6203.52 --> 6207.8
the Earth that's

6205.0 --> 6211.08
moving right there is no Coralis

6207.8 --> 6213.400000000001
deviation of air continually moving

6211.08 --> 6217.76
because the Earth is stationary it is

6213.4 --> 6220.119
still and that's why we have entire days

6217.76 --> 6222.96
or even periods of weeks where there is

6220.119 --> 6227.4
no wind at all it's

6222.96 --> 6230.2390000000005
still that could in no way ever under

6227.4 --> 6233.159
any circumstances any conceivable

6230.239 --> 6236.799999999999
circumstances happen on a spinning bow

6233.159 --> 6241.4
Earth the wind could never be still at

6236.8 --> 6244.159000000001
any point any point under any

6241.4 --> 6244.159
conceivable

6246.679 --> 6254.52
circumstance don't call it a rogain

6249.56 --> 6254.52
AI don't keep doing this

6255.92 --> 6259.609
[Music]

6267.0 --> 6275.199
by all means thumbs it

6270.199 --> 6280.4
up leave the eye out of there stop

6275.199 --> 6280.4
[ __ ] around it's really tedious

6296.76 --> 6303.04
you two party fish don't [ __ ] do it I

6300.56 --> 6306.320000000001
see anybody else say that one more

6303.04 --> 6310.0
[ __ ] time I will kick you

6306.32 --> 6310.0
out got it party

6312.719 --> 6317.2390000000005
fish yeah don't look at other

6319.8 --> 6323.4800000000005
people especially people that don't have

6322.4 --> 6326.04
wrenches

6323.48 --> 6326.04
don't do

6335.48 --> 6342.799999999999
that I think I'm going to fix it some

6338.08 --> 6342.8
other way it's just so tedious

6369.599 --> 6372.88
all right so now that's

6381.92 --> 6385.88
resolved for

6411.46 --> 6414.76
[Applause]

6417.86 --> 6421.0
[Music]

6441.96 --> 6445.159
all right anyway

6443.8 --> 6447.599
it's been a very

6445.159 --> 6450.879999999999
constructive Flat Earth oriented

6447.599 --> 6453.400000000001
conversation thus far pretty cool

6450.88 --> 6458.84
thought a typo was yeah well it's very

6453.4 --> 6462.679
specific typo isn't it party fish very

6458.84 --> 6465.08
specific yeah it's curious how the typo

6462.679 --> 6469.36
isn't like working

6465.08 --> 6473.119
differently yeah also that eye the eye

6469.36 --> 6475.36
in the typo yeah it's nowhere near any

6473.119 --> 6478.36
of the other

6475.36 --> 6483.239
Keys

6478.36 --> 6483.239
very suspicious typo

6485.8 --> 6492.88
huh yeah but don't worry you won't be

6490.48 --> 6495.28
able to make that typo anymore because

6492.88 --> 6496.28
now it's in the blocked words you could

6495.28 --> 6500.719
just say

6496.28 --> 6504.719
rogans if you misspell it accidentally

6500.719 --> 6507.719
it just won't show up huh huh how about

6504.719 --> 6507.719
that

6513.81 --> 6517.009
[Music]

6561.0 --> 6564.639
what how the hell were you able ble to

6563.08 --> 6567.639
say

6564.639 --> 6567.639
that

6574.88 --> 6578.92
clutch how

6581.159 --> 6586.32
what I don't know what the hell is so

6583.639 --> 6589.2390000000005
trollish about forehead though clutch I

6586.32 --> 6589.239
mean I don't really

6591.639 --> 6595.679
care for

6631.239 --> 6637.718999999999
right anyway hope you all like the show

6634.679 --> 6639.2390000000005
maybe yeah the trolls are annoying but

6637.719 --> 6641.88
if you like the show don't forget the

6639.239 --> 6641.879999999999
Rogan it

6646.199 --> 6652.48
up but yeah clutch I can block words the

6649.48 --> 6655.799999999999
problem though is that usually trolls

6652.48 --> 6659.718999999999
just just respell it Etc if they really

6655.8 --> 6659.719
want to troll it's

6660.56 --> 6665.679
just I don't want to keep addressing it

6663.159 --> 6665.679
it's very

6666.28 --> 6671.44
tedious so I'm just blocking the words

6668.96 --> 6671.44
and that's

6671.52 --> 6678.92
it yeah there's no damn reason for

6675.04 --> 6681.36
anybody to ever bring those words up

6678.92 --> 6685.32
without malignant

6681.36 --> 6685.32
intent there's no reason

6694.159 --> 6700.879999999999
whatsoever ah

6696.56 --> 6700.88
eight that's cool

6742.239 --> 6746.919999999999
right guys I think I'm going to take a

6743.44 --> 6746.919999999999
two-minute break and I'll be right

6771.44 --> 6774.44
back

6801.44 --> 6805.48
for for

6860.199 --> 6863.799999999999
anding them back

6867.199 --> 6875.598999999999
no no there's no things that are welcome

6870.96 --> 6878.679
like that bodyy fish you're a

6875.599 --> 6881.76
person or you're out of

6878.679 --> 6885.88
here yeah nobody is an

6881.76 --> 6885.88
animal or any kind of

6887.0 --> 6892.92
group

6889.56 --> 6895.4800000000005
yeah I'm sick of the stupid memes sick

6892.92 --> 6899.52
of you guys just wasting my time with

6895.48 --> 6899.5199999999995
that nonsense stop

6899.76 --> 6905.52
it you partake in the conversation or

6902.96 --> 6908.52
get the hell

6905.52 --> 6908.52
out

6915.639 --> 6921.28
yeah Earth is flat and

6918.56 --> 6924.280000000001
stationary there's no cor Coralis

6921.28 --> 6924.28
deviation

6925.4 --> 6931.119
gyroscope stay rigid in ukian

6928.599 --> 6934.119000000001
space it's what they're used for

6931.119 --> 6934.119
technologically

6965.0 --> 6967.92
what the hell is that

6970.56 --> 6974.4400000000005
Gary hell does that even

6981.0 --> 6987.88
me oh

6983.76 --> 6987.88
oh you think that's funny

6991.079 --> 6994.719
Gary you think that's

7009.079 --> 7014.36
funny I mean if you're a funny guy like

7011.8 --> 7014.360000000001
that I I

7014.8 --> 7022.04
mean it should also be B no no it

7018.84 --> 7024.92
shouldn't now you should just not bring

7022.04 --> 7027.28
it up and be a [ __ ]

7024.92 --> 7029.88
[ __ ] I thought you were here on my

7027.28 --> 7032.719
show to partake in the show and have

7029.88 --> 7036.0
conversations and not contribute to the

7032.719 --> 7036.0
[ __ ] trolling

7057.679 --> 7064.36

7149.04 --> 7152.04
think

7164.159 --> 7168.96
but like dank still does around hang

7166.8 --> 7172.360000000001
around like on

7168.96 --> 7174.88
Discord the uh Flat Earth debates

7172.36 --> 7179.96
Channel and all

7174.88 --> 7179.96
that when last slowmo on

7181.88 --> 7187.599
here not sure like over a month ago

7208.32 --> 7214.679
so yeah I know he was in here

7211.719 --> 7219.4
like wasn't he here in for a second like

7214.679 --> 7219.4
yesterday or two days ago

7224.239 --> 7229.28
when I got real pissed off with teret he

7226.96 --> 7229.28
popped

7250.92 --> 7254.96
up for

7340.639 --> 7343.92
these people don't like

7342.4 --> 7346.32
I don't I wouldn't know why though

7343.92 --> 7348.92
clutch I mean always been like in good

7346.32 --> 7348.92
spirits with

7353.719 --> 7360.119
them we've had some really interesting

7356.32 --> 7362.48
conversations so I yeah maybe I don't

7360.119 --> 7364.92
know clutch I don't

7362.48 --> 7367.879999999999
know but I mean plenty of people that

7364.92 --> 7369.92
have been good with would suddenly just

7367.88 --> 7375.119
not show up

7369.92 --> 7375.119
anymore so I I I don't know why that

7383.0 --> 7388.199
happens I wish it didn't I wish I did

7385.639 --> 7391.599
stick around that would be

7388.199 --> 7394.638999999999
fantastic but yeah I guess people just

7391.599 --> 7394.639
move on at some

7396.96 --> 7405.0
point or maybe they miss my my routin

7402.76 --> 7406.8
I mean I I used to get like a lot more

7405.0 --> 7410.199
aggressive and energetic and I think

7406.8 --> 7410.1990000000005
that does appeal to certain

7411.199 --> 7417.199
people but yeah I am trying to cut down

7414.199 --> 7422.5599999999995
on doing that as much as I

7417.199 --> 7422.5599999999995
can CU it's not very healthy for me

7425.559 --> 7430.679
and and it distracts away and it

7428.52 --> 7433.92
increases the amount of trolling and I

7430.679 --> 7433.92
don't need more more

7435.239 --> 7440.04
trolling yeah people do get busy and

7437.8 --> 7444.1990000000005
need breaks that's right just like I

7440.04 --> 7444.199

done when you do this [ __ ] it makes

about the consequences of actions you do

8552.72 --> 8557.64
you seem to have very little

8554.479 --> 8560.119999999999

9306.12 --> 9310.880000000001
stuff I mean like oh yeah the

9308.12 --> 9310.880000000001
government's out of

9311.399 --> 9316.519999999999
control they're corrupt they're having

9314.359 --> 9320.52
their own agenda that's against the

9316.52 --> 9320.52
people yeah

9329.319 --> 9334.56
apparently it is reaching more

9331.64 --> 9339.519999999999
mainstream news

9334.56 --> 9339.519999999999
even that's good I guess

9359.68 --> 9362.68
all

9366.59 --> 9369.68
[Music]

9393.29 --> 9397.84
[Music]

9395.24 --> 9400.96
right so anything else out there maybe

9397.84 --> 9403.6
more in content response to like the

9400.96 --> 9405.278999999999
subject that we were talking about

9403.6 --> 9408.12
today

9405.279 --> 9410.24
gyroscopes how they stay rigid in ukian

9408.12 --> 9413.68
space and how they're being used

9410.24 --> 9417.119999999999
specifically because of that

9413.68 --> 9417.12
quality for

9417.64 --> 9424.92
orientation on a stationary flat plane

9421.92 --> 9429.359
like in relation to

9424.92 --> 9432.76
it yeah you get it spinning you move

9429.359 --> 9434.960000000001
around move over the Earth's surface and

9432.76 --> 9435.880000000001
hey the orientation of the gyroscope is

9434.96 --> 9440.0
not

9435.88 --> 9442.319
changing yeah because the Earth is flat

9440.0 --> 9445.92
right and you just keep it in the same

9442.319 --> 9447.6
spot and oh look after 24 hours the

9445.92 --> 9453.72
orientation hasn't

9447.6 --> 9453.720000000001
changed yeah because the Earth isn't

9456.08 --> 9462.84
spinning Earth is flat and stationary

9459.2 --> 9465.6
and gyroscopes a mechanical device

9462.84 --> 9469.6
proves that not scientifically

9465.6 --> 9469.6
but geometrically

9472.11 --> 9475.689
[Music]

9478.52 --> 9484.319000000001
isn't that just

9480.84 --> 9484.319
interesting how that

9493.439 --> 9499.16
works way more interesting than this

9496.399 --> 9502.68
stupid infighting bickering about people

9499.16 --> 9502.68
in my chat

9558.359 --> 9562.359
um for

9600.76 --> 9605.76
all right well

9603.24 --> 9607.68
nothing nothing for six minutes well I

9605.76 --> 9612.2
guess I'm going to round out the show

9607.68 --> 9612.2
then I mean I tried

9625.52 --> 9630.880000000001
right so when I start the show

9628.76 --> 9633.6
tomorrow I don't want any more

9630.88 --> 9637.08
infighting from

9633.6 --> 9641.24
anybody want people to stick to the

9637.08 --> 9643.92
subject at hand that will be decided

9641.24 --> 9646.76
upon in the early phase of the show like

9643.92 --> 9650.76
today it was yeah

9646.76 --> 9650.76
gyroscopes ether

9651.52 --> 9657.359
gyroscopes because like ether is

9654.479 --> 9659.24
partially claimed based on the supposed

9657.359 --> 9661.84
drift of a gyroscope and that's how it

9659.24 --> 9664.88
came in being that's how it came to this

9661.84 --> 9667.0
subject I mostly prefer that people

9664.88 --> 9669.56
stick to that

9667.0 --> 9671.88
subject and definitely don't start

9669.56 --> 9675.119999999999
sending me emails about what some other

9671.88 --> 9675.119999999999
person has done in some

9675.56 --> 9682.16
chat cuz that literally broke the show

9678.92 --> 9686.479
we could have gone on for like another

9682.16 --> 9690.64
hour but uh yeah now it's all the energy

9686.479 --> 9690.64
is all out of it because of all the

9692.2 --> 9696.960000000001
bickering which is quite yeah quite a

9694.92 --> 9700.479
shame

9696.96 --> 9702.56
right all right so tomorrow another day

9700.479 --> 9705.358999999999
might try again I'm not entirely sure

9702.56 --> 9707.278999999999
like uh with the timing of today's of

9705.359 --> 9709.52
tomorrow's show because I also have an

9707.279 --> 9711.12
appointment somewhere don't know where

9709.52 --> 9714.640000000001
that's going to take place it might take

9711.12 --> 9718.76
place like while I normally do the

9714.64 --> 9721.88
show so maybe tomorrow like I won't

9718.76 --> 9724.279
start at the normal time maybe I won't

9721.88 --> 9727.399
be able to even closely do that and if

9724.279 --> 9729.24
so then I might just do like a night owl

9727.399 --> 9732.519999999999
show again

9729.24 --> 9732.52
instead we'll

9735.64 --> 9739.88
