[Music]

47.18 --> 52.1

78.78 --> 83.28
still use the support so please keep it

81.659 --> 85.82000000000001
coming

83.28 --> 85.82000000000001
foreign

86.84 --> 92.22
right anyway the weather today is really

89.82 --> 94.979
turn around in a lot of ways

92.22 --> 96.53999999999999
but it's mostly the wind

94.979 --> 99.259
because suddenly there seems to be

96.54 --> 99.259
almost no wind

99.9 --> 104.22
that was quite a change from yesterday

102.24 --> 106.46
when it's been blowing all over the

104.22 --> 106.46
place

108.06 --> 116.24000000000001
stop really rushing up there as well

111.18 --> 116.24000000000001
it's still moving but much slower and

117.18 --> 121.82000000000001
clouds seem to be bigger too

121.86 --> 125.06
more bulky

125.1 --> 129.439
I don't know if rain comes out of that

129.72 --> 136.34
doesn't really look like it to me

132.3 --> 136.34
but yeah picturesque Skies

136.8 --> 143.22
and it is pretty sunny

139.62 --> 147.44
stopped up my plants

143.22 --> 147.44
water very necessary

155.7 --> 159.92
so yeah kind of a beautiful day actually

161.94 --> 166.44
I wonder if it's any warmer than

164.34 --> 168.599
yesterday or it just feels like it

166.44 --> 170.099
because there's no wind to cool me off

168.599 --> 173.16
we'll see

170.099 --> 176.35999999999999
anyway hello Moxie first in chat Richard

173.16 --> 176.35999999999999
G good to see you

181.4 --> 186.739
started painting and then it started

183.54 --> 186.739
raining yeah that sucks

193.08 --> 198.78
I used to have that when I was like

196.5 --> 203.04
at one point it's like my parents

198.78 --> 206.04
basically hired me to do painting work

203.04 --> 207.78
because it was like too much and they

206.04 --> 211.019
didn't have time

207.78 --> 213.78
I did a decent job at it

211.019 --> 216.26
but yeah it's completely impossible when

213.78 --> 216.26
it's raining

221.819 --> 227.099
yeah and by the way the painting was

224.22 --> 229.379
like it was also like painting old wood

227.099 --> 232.94
and we were like dealing with the whole

229.379 --> 232.94
the house was overall pretty old

233.84 --> 240.239
and like especially in like the last

237.06 --> 243.12
decade it was a continual fight fighting

240.239 --> 246.20000000000002
against wood rot and all that and my dad

243.12 --> 246.20000000000002
got really sick of it

246.239 --> 250.98000000000002
because it just felt like you were

248.159 --> 253.14
fighting fighting a collapsing house

250.98 --> 256.139
like that because everything was just

253.14 --> 259.139
continually crumbling

256.139 --> 261.66
anyway the the person

259.139 --> 263.46000000000004
family that bought it off us like I

261.66 --> 266.12
think they completely rebuild that they

263.46 --> 266.12
were like typical

267.12 --> 273.06
uh people that rebuild houses and all

270.24 --> 275.78000000000003
that so they probably permanently fixed

273.06 --> 275.78000000000003
all that but

277.56 --> 282.18
it's quite a lot of work

279.9 --> 285.32
maintaining that house still very

282.18 --> 285.32
beautiful house though

289.919 --> 294.18
um

291.84 --> 299.82
right anyway

294.18 --> 299.82
it is Tuesday the 18th of July 2023

300.67 --> 304.91900000000004
[Music]

303.54 --> 307.08000000000004
sure

304.919 --> 310.79999999999995
probably

307.08 --> 313.15999999999997
around 22 oh 24 okay so it is a bit

310.8 --> 313.16
warmer

317.58 --> 320.24
right

323.16 --> 327.08000000000004
you got the doors done okay

330.9 --> 337.88
right and these days there's probably

333.06 --> 337.88
much better paint than in the 90s

342.84 --> 348.29999999999995
because with that pain if you'd paint

345.06 --> 350.58
and then like it rained water droplets

348.3 --> 351.84000000000003
would literally like ruin the paint you

350.58 --> 354.06
would get

351.84 --> 355.53
Bubbles and [ __ ]

354.06 --> 358.66
very annoying

355.53 --> 358.65999999999997
[Music]

366.24 --> 368.90000000000003
anyway

368.94 --> 375.36
yeah yesterday was pretty intense

372.38 --> 376.919
super long FTD

375.36 --> 379.139
I guess

376.919 --> 381.539
especially the guys had some catching up

379.139 --> 383.28000000000003
to they were just they kept talking past

381.539 --> 387.479
like eight

383.28 --> 389.46
it got a bit long-minded it had a lot to

387.479 --> 391.74
quite catch up on apparently and there

389.46 --> 395.28
was kind of an event that kept everybody

391.74 --> 398.0
talking about it that is Dell came on in

395.28 --> 398.0
the after show

398.16 --> 402.12
and

399.84 --> 406.15999999999997
yeah

402.12 --> 406.16
and then kind of Hell broke loose

406.919 --> 415.68
because he got triggered and Nathan like

410.759 --> 419.639
got real he basically got fed up with it

415.68 --> 422.639
did that turn yes he did and it was

419.639 --> 422.639
gruesome

422.819 --> 427.62
and Nathan was really patient at first

425.1 --> 429.90000000000003
too it was like really nice and polite

427.62 --> 433.5
and they'll just at some point he

429.9 --> 435.84
realized that he didn't have grip on the

433.5 --> 438.139
arguments as well as he hoped you can

435.84 --> 441.29999999999995
tell the stories from his

438.139 --> 444.06
presupposition of anti-toiness he does

441.3 --> 447.72
but he can't actually debate it

444.06 --> 450.599
and he started basically

447.72 --> 453.06
he didn't give in to that he didn't

450.599 --> 455.28
admit it and so he basically ended up

453.06 --> 457.08
like an anti-flat earther although it

455.28 --> 458.15999999999997
wasn't about Flat Earth but about this

457.08 --> 460.25899999999996
upward

458.16 --> 462.78000000000003
moving Earth

460.259 --> 464.099
and he became a baller about it sounded

462.78 --> 466.73999999999995
like a baller

464.099 --> 469.68
he would literally like

466.74 --> 472.38
I can't do it justice but like

469.68 --> 476.28000000000003
the weird little demonic laugh and like

472.38 --> 477.479
continual like barrage of at-home

476.28 --> 479.75899999999996
like

477.479 --> 481.74
not having a response and then just like

479.759 --> 483.47900000000004
oh nothing this and that oh it's so

481.74 --> 486.419
disgusting and

483.479 --> 489.71999999999997
trying to ridicule it it was really kind

486.419 --> 492.35999999999996
of gruesome like that so

489.72 --> 495.66
it it wasn't like one of the more

492.36 --> 497.88
Pleasant feds but it was certainly

495.66 --> 501.02000000000004
interesting and they'll made complete

497.88 --> 501.02
ass out of himself

501.72 --> 507.24
at first I expected him to go live right

504.18 --> 510.12
after to basically van off

507.24 --> 512.58
because it typically does do that

510.12 --> 514.919
but I mean I'm pretty sure he was kind

512.58 --> 517.88
of broken by this because he didn't show

514.919 --> 517.88
up afterward

518.039 --> 524.039
he probably expanded all his energy

521.399 --> 528.06
during that show because it just kept on

524.039 --> 530.76
for hours guys it was crazy

528.06 --> 532.56
this wasn't just like

530.76 --> 535.86
three

532.56 --> 538.5
45 minutes or something in the first

535.86 --> 540.54
15 minutes were civil and the rest then

538.5 --> 544.519
gets angry leaves no he just doesn't

540.54 --> 544.519
leave he's so [ __ ] stubborn

544.98 --> 548.9590000000001
and it's it's like brutal

554.399 --> 559.32
and it gave that feeling of just seeing

556.8 --> 560.8199999999999
a guy walk into a minefield

559.32 --> 565.2
blow

560.82 --> 568.74
his foot off and then just keep going

565.2 --> 571.74
and then there's more of my like it's it

568.74 --> 574.62
was brutal it was really brutal it was

571.74 --> 576.6
not very pleasant for me eventually it

574.62 --> 579.24
but you couldn't get in either I mean

576.6 --> 582.5400000000001
Nathan basically locked up he basically

579.24 --> 585.0
shut all the the gates

582.54 --> 587.0999999999999
and people and even

585.0 --> 588.779
in a g plus they were like trying like

587.1 --> 590.16
but ah come on just give him a chance

588.779 --> 592.38
and like

590.16 --> 594.899
we were getting pity for him but he was

592.38 --> 597.6
just Nathan wasn't gonna have any of it

594.899 --> 599.22
eventually like Brian had a few good

597.6 --> 600.48
moments with Dell

599.22 --> 603.9200000000001
but

600.48 --> 603.9200000000001
he just wouldn't listen

605.88 --> 610.56
like he wouldn't even accept that his

608.58 --> 615.62
entire premise

610.56 --> 615.6199999999999
is presuppositional he wouldn't admit it

616.2 --> 620.1
but that could be because he just

617.88 --> 622.68
couldn't be made to understand

620.1 --> 625.019
it just I don't think I said it before

622.68 --> 626.5799999999999
and I don't say it with Glee or

625.019 --> 630.18
Victorious

626.58 --> 633.74
hubris or whatever it's he he just

630.18 --> 633.7399999999999
doesn't have the grip

637.019 --> 644.0
he doesn't have like that oversight

640.8 --> 648.779
he can't put the different

644.0 --> 649.62
instances or events of data together in

648.779 --> 652.4399999999999
a

649.62 --> 655.74
like in an over connecting framework

652.44 --> 657.3000000000001
he's not he's not good at that

655.74 --> 658.98
like at all

657.3 --> 660.3599999999999
and especially on the pressure it

658.98 --> 662.94
becomes worse

660.36 --> 665.279
so it just doesn't have the oversight

662.94 --> 668.2790000000001
I mean the only oversight I've ever seen

665.279 --> 670.26
him have even is in moments on his own

668.279 --> 672.779
show where it's really calm

670.26 --> 675.8389999999999
and then he might get a bit of a grip

672.779 --> 679.519
but it doesn't last very long

675.839 --> 679.519
so he's just not good at it

679.92 --> 684.4799999999999
and he's basically trying to take on a

682.44 --> 686.6600000000001
battle that he's just not capable of

684.48 --> 686.66
doing

693.06 --> 696.8
Super Bowl clinking

702.3 --> 706.9799999999999
but dude he was like

704.279 --> 709.5
when Nathan like gets really hard and

706.98 --> 712.019
you then don't realize this is a Fubar

709.5 --> 714.899
situation I got to stop it

712.019 --> 719.3
well then you get in then you get the

714.899 --> 719.3
weird cackling and the demon behavior

721.22 --> 725.399
and that's what was happening to Dale

723.72 --> 727.98
like a lot

725.399 --> 730.62
you just and he just

727.98 --> 733.6800000000001
all he had to do is just [ __ ] give up

730.62 --> 736.92
something that is not winnable

733.68 --> 739.5
but no it was it was like

736.92 --> 741.4799999999999
it's like Hitler like no we're gonna get

739.5 --> 743.519
Stalingrad yeah but it's [ __ ]

741.48 --> 745.74
impossible everybody's gonna die no

743.519 --> 747.0
we're gonna do it he was like that it's

745.74 --> 748.09
just like

747.0 --> 749.76
dude

748.09 --> 751.9200000000001
[Music]

749.76 --> 755.22
everything that you're gonna experience

751.92 --> 757.1999999999999
after this is all your own fault all of

755.22 --> 759.98
it

757.2 --> 759.98
all of it

760.2 --> 764.76
I can't even really blame Nathan for

762.779 --> 768.12
getting a bit ugly

764.76 --> 769.56
because I mean Dale got a lot uglier for

768.12 --> 771.66
no damn reason

769.56 --> 774.8389999999999
just because

771.66 --> 778.6999999999999
he felt humiliated let's start chain gun

774.839 --> 778.7
at homing really pathetic

779.339 --> 784.0400000000001
so that's what you get so yeah that was

781.2 --> 784.0400000000001
quite a ruckus

785.88 --> 789.8389999999999
anyway hello slow mo moon buggy good to

788.04 --> 792.92
see you

789.839 --> 792.9200000000001
zap tapi

807.24 --> 811.5790000000001
right anyway so that happened

812.16 --> 817.68
also was kind of funny

815.36 --> 819.9590000000001
and these are the things that make me

817.68 --> 822.42
think that Owen Benjamin is secretly

819.959 --> 826.38
watching my show

822.42 --> 830.959
but I mean it's probably not true

826.38 --> 830.959
I mean he would just say it

831.72 --> 835.8000000000001
I don't think he's not like a secret

833.399 --> 837.959
Watcher or something and besides like

835.8 --> 840.4399999999999
I'm not that [ __ ] entertained not to

837.959 --> 840.4399999999999
his level

840.66 --> 845.6999999999999
I have interesting things but I'm not

843.06 --> 847.5
super entertaining what hello Owen who's

845.7 --> 849.24
Owen

847.5 --> 853.459
oh

849.24 --> 853.4590000000001
to if he's secretly watching yeah well

853.8 --> 859.6999999999999
good luck to that but the funny thing

856.2 --> 864.0
was are you yes they had the whole

859.7 --> 866.339
Elementary my dear Watson

864.0 --> 868.639
it's reference to own bed and now he had

866.339 --> 868.639
it

869.82 --> 874.98
yeah he had this theme now he chose this

872.519 --> 877.8
theme like virology

874.98 --> 880.9200000000001
is fake and is the actual real thing is

877.8 --> 884.699
demonology it's like oh demonology I

880.92 --> 887.3389999999999
just watched a movie based on demonology

884.699 --> 889.56
like I just did that that day

887.339 --> 892.9200000000001
and now he's putting in that theme and

889.56 --> 892.92
I'm like wow

893.1 --> 898.519
did somebody watch my show and thought

895.74 --> 898.519
like hey

898.8 --> 905.2199999999999
I mean that is what I try to do

902.519 --> 906.72
but it was kind of cool and it was a it

905.22 --> 910.6800000000001
was a fun show

906.72 --> 912.899
it has this new search engine thing

910.68 --> 915.7199999999999
sort of search engine database thing

912.899 --> 917.82
called niggle

915.72 --> 920.0400000000001
that is it was testing out to basically

917.82 --> 921.899
search like all the quotes that he's

920.04 --> 924.0
ever made like

921.899 --> 925.68
that's an interesting thing like a sort

924.0 --> 928.92
of database thing that can literally

925.68 --> 932.279
scan through video material

928.92 --> 934.3199999999999
and then basically transcribe everything

932.279 --> 938.279
that is said

934.32 --> 940.32
in like a palatable way that it not just

938.279 --> 943.139
singular single out words

940.32 --> 946.139
it's very interesting I'd be kind of

943.139 --> 948.54
curious to learn about that

946.139 --> 951.1800000000001
about that system because I mean I have

948.54 --> 953.76
a giant intangible amount of video

951.18 --> 955.68
material and I've made a whole bunch of

953.76 --> 958.8
predictions

955.68 --> 960.54
that I really can't even point back I

958.8 --> 963.7199999999999
can't just say like yeah I predicted it

960.54 --> 966.7199999999999
roughly then I don't know which episode

963.72 --> 968.94
I'm not that detailed about it I just

966.72 --> 972.26
know that I did that

968.94 --> 975.72
but if I have have a program like miggle

972.26 --> 978.36
Unleashed on my video database

975.72 --> 980.76
somehow I mean it can't just do it just

978.36 --> 982.38
like that quickly probably have to have

980.76 --> 986.06
it all uploaded

982.38 --> 986.06
on one server or something

986.459 --> 991.68
well then it could be pretty handy even

988.32 --> 993.839
to have that and he was Owen was kind of

991.68 --> 995.76
like yeah this is revolutionary and like

993.839 --> 997.74
this is gonna change the game

995.76 --> 999.54
because he's probably right about that

997.74 --> 1001.04
it's it seemed very interesting and I

999.54 --> 1003.86
immediately thought hey I kind of want

1001.04 --> 1006.199
to have that for my videos

1003.86 --> 1007.94
and I'm not the only one I'm pretty damn

1006.199 --> 1010.959
sure of that

1007.94 --> 1013.399
so maybe that's gonna be like a new

1010.959 --> 1017.2589999999999
technological feature that might

1013.399 --> 1017.259
eventually start popping up

1017.899 --> 1021.92
that was kind of cool

1019.88 --> 1024.26
right so yeah yesterday's show Owen

1021.92 --> 1027.02
Benjamin was entertaining

1024.26 --> 1029.74
and interesting he was like very

1027.02 --> 1029.74
energetic

1033.919 --> 1038.48
so that was a great show and much later

1036.74 --> 1040.22
he had another show it's kind of the

1038.48 --> 1043.179
thing that kept me up a bit part of the

1040.22 --> 1043.179
reason I'm a bit late

1043.52 --> 1047.959
because there was another show we had an

1045.98 --> 1051.08
interview or we had was on somebody

1047.959 --> 1053.6200000000001
else's show I was really late till like

1051.08 --> 1053.62
four o'clock

1056.059 --> 1061.299
so around there just it was really late

1058.88 --> 1061.2990000000002
for me

1062.24 --> 1068.66
hey LSG

1065.24 --> 1070.78
and to the louvian catharsis good to see

1068.66 --> 1070.78
you

1082.12 --> 1085.3899999999999
[Music]

1090.74 --> 1095.24
lots of energy right now the Sun and

1092.84 --> 1098.1999999999998
Moon are close together

1095.24 --> 1098.2
is it new moon

1113.74 --> 1121.0
I haven't really kept track of the moon

1117.2 --> 1121.0
cycle too much

1121.16 --> 1126.0800000000002
but I think I've seen like a sickle of

1123.799 --> 1129.6399999999999
it recently so yeah it makes sense that

1126.08 --> 1129.6399999999999
it would be around that time

1131.36 --> 1136.059
it's interesting that you say that

1133.16 --> 1138.74
there's more energy

1136.059 --> 1141.3999999999999
because of that

1138.74 --> 1141.4
how so

1142.76 --> 1147.2
do you mean that the sunlight is

1145.039 --> 1149.6
stronger because of that or that there's

1147.2 --> 1153.039
like a spiritual energy

1149.6 --> 1153.039
what exactly do you mean

1158.24 --> 1160.66
what

1165.38 --> 1167.38
um

1168.38 --> 1173.72
oh magpies trying to take a bath

1171.559 --> 1176.74
the water's really low but he seems

1173.72 --> 1176.74
really desperate for it

1176.9 --> 1184.14
probably refill that somewhere soon

1179.84 --> 1187.2389999999998
just keeps going back I'm back I'm back

1184.14 --> 1187.239
[Music]

1195.14 --> 1200.2990000000002
oh okay it's something you heard but

1198.26 --> 1202.16
I'm just trying to be more specific

1200.299 --> 1205.039
about

1202.16 --> 1206.1200000000001
what that implies

1205.039 --> 1208.16
or

1206.12 --> 1209.799
a one way to figure that out is like who

1208.16 --> 1212.8400000000001
did you hear it from were they like

1209.799 --> 1215.6
astrology people

1212.84 --> 1218.12
or was it more like physics oriented

1215.6 --> 1221.559
flat earthers and about actual light

1218.12 --> 1221.559
output right so

1228.74 --> 1232.64
because it would be kind of an

1230.36 --> 1235.34
interesting idea that

1232.64 --> 1237.679
the proximity of the Moon even though

1235.34 --> 1239.1789999999999
it's invisible

1237.679 --> 1240.8600000000001
to the Sun

1239.179 --> 1244.16
would matter

1240.86 --> 1246.9189999999999
like a lens or something

1244.16 --> 1248.66
like change the way that the light goes

1246.919 --> 1251.0590000000002
through it or something and that that

1248.66 --> 1254.559
would cause it to strengthen I mean it's

1251.059 --> 1254.559
an interesting concept

1254.96 --> 1260.26
ever mysterious holographic Celestial

1258.02 --> 1260.26
lights

1263.74 --> 1267.94
cultivate Elevate channel oh

1271.82 --> 1275.5
a Grower's Channel

1276.679 --> 1282.5590000000002
where was this nail debacle it was in

1279.38 --> 1284.96
the FED after show

1282.559 --> 1287.1789999999999
if you remember that then there is a

1284.96 --> 1289.159
Premiere that you can already watch of

1287.179 --> 1293.2
it

1289.159 --> 1293.2
was like three and a half hours so

1300.919 --> 1306.26
but uh yeah Nathan is probably gonna

1303.14 --> 1308.72
release that like on Saturday something

1306.26 --> 1310.8799999999999
like that maybe sooner

1308.72 --> 1311.659
if he feels it's urgent for it to get

1310.88 --> 1312.8600000000001
out

1311.659 --> 1314.96
okay

1312.86 --> 1316.34
yeah you're not a member well then you

1314.96 --> 1319.96
don't know

1316.34 --> 1319.9599999999998
you're just gonna have to wait

1320.96 --> 1324.98
or you could subscribe to Nathan Oakley

1323.78 --> 1326.8999999999999
today

1324.98 --> 1329.559
become a member and then you can watch

1326.9 --> 1329.5590000000002
it immediately

1340.46 --> 1345.14
foreign

1342.14 --> 1347.2990000000002
I mean I play something of it but Nathan

1345.14 --> 1350.0800000000002
hasn't actually premiered it yet so I

1347.299 --> 1350.08
don't want to do that

1352.76 --> 1356.48
Nathan would probably not be happy if I

1355.46 --> 1361.0
did that

1356.48 --> 1361.0
well yeah not without asking anyway

1363.679 --> 1368.8400000000001
I'll ask the day

1366.559 --> 1372.94
like when is he gonna Premiere is it

1368.84 --> 1372.9399999999998
okay if I play some of that video

1377.84 --> 1380.84
on my show

1379.52 --> 1384.76
anyway

1380.84 --> 1384.76
hey George Sanford good to see you

1390.82 --> 1396.6789999999999
magnetic gloves Pro Sports

1395.179 --> 1400.76
rigged

1396.679 --> 1403.9
well the big the big things yeah

1400.76 --> 1403.9
the big things are

1415.28 --> 1421.82
although the weird thing is though yo

1417.74 --> 1423.98
like they could just come out with it

1421.82 --> 1427.82
and just say yeah we are updating the

1423.98 --> 1431.679
sports you can now use magnetic gloves

1427.82 --> 1431.6789999999999
it would become slightly different

1432.02 --> 1438.9189999999999
with more dramatic moves probably I mean

1435.74 --> 1441.44
yeah it's not you could say oh it's

1438.919 --> 1442.48
cheating unless you just change the

1441.44 --> 1445.76
sport

1442.48 --> 1447.919
update it got more futuristic and then

1445.76 --> 1450.62
it's just legal

1447.919 --> 1452.2990000000002
you don't hide it you know try to fool

1450.62 --> 1454.28
people with it

1452.299 --> 1456.62
because that's that's just stupid if

1454.28 --> 1459.32
there's like oh only the the star

1456.62 --> 1461.1789999999999
players get to have it so they can make

1459.32 --> 1462.799
super dramatic looking moves that are

1461.179 --> 1464.9
basically impossible

1462.799 --> 1466.76
everybody thinks they're superheroes and

1464.9 --> 1469.52
others can't

1466.76 --> 1470.84
that would just kind of be unfair that

1469.52 --> 1475.52
would be

1470.84 --> 1477.6789999999999
like really manipulating the crowd

1475.52 --> 1481.24
but if they just come out with this like

1477.679 --> 1481.24
hey yeah we got this stuff

1481.58 --> 1487.6999999999998
and it makes the game looks much more

1484.4 --> 1490.94
dramatic and awesome so

1487.7 --> 1492.26
we're just making those gloves legal

1490.94 --> 1494.659
and like

1492.26 --> 1498.14
like anybody in the game is allowed to

1494.659 --> 1500.5390000000002
use them and it would change the sport

1498.14 --> 1501.9
what sport that's

1500.539 --> 1504.26
American football

1501.9 --> 1506.1200000000001
[Music]

1504.26 --> 1507.98
I think it was American Football that

1506.12 --> 1511.2399999999998
had that

1507.98 --> 1511.24
if I remember correctly

1518.36 --> 1522.4599999999998
it's cold that's different

1530.44 --> 1537.22
steroids are already basically

1534.38 --> 1537.22
part of it

1548.08 --> 1551.58
[Music]

1554.419 --> 1558.5590000000002
okay

1556.34 --> 1561.58
basketball I don't know

1558.559 --> 1561.58
yeah could be

1574.64 --> 1580.039
but the point is is like yeah if they do

1577.34 --> 1584.0
it sneakily and give like Superstar

1580.039 --> 1585.74
people love Powers that's really grapply

1584.0 --> 1588.38
and it's kind of evil

1585.74 --> 1591.02
very manipulative but did you say like

1588.38 --> 1593.48
no we're updating sports with this this

1591.02 --> 1596.48
new stuff

1593.48 --> 1597.799
it would just become more action-packed

1596.48 --> 1600.799
it would

1597.799 --> 1602.299
right everybody gets

1600.799 --> 1604.82
like

1602.299 --> 1607.7
because what do those things do they

1604.82 --> 1611.539
take down the amount of of

1607.7 --> 1614.6000000000001
flubs like try to grab the ball and it

1611.539 --> 1616.76
you can't get a grip it slips right so

1614.6 --> 1619.6399999999999
you have more epic Maneuvers that

1616.76 --> 1621.679
succeed well that will make people on

1619.64 --> 1623.72
average more confident and will make it

1621.679 --> 1626.0590000000002
more spectacular so it wouldn't even be

1623.72 --> 1628.22
bad to just say okay

1626.059 --> 1631.48
we're allowing this now

1628.22 --> 1631.48
be open about it

1638.179 --> 1642.38
I mean if it just became open then I bet

1641.12 --> 1644.8999999999999
there's going to be people that are

1642.38 --> 1647.659
going to get really creative with it and

1644.9 --> 1650.3600000000001
we'll like do like they will probably

1647.659 --> 1653.0
start attempting Maneuvers that will

1650.36 --> 1655.3999999999999
look like super hero Maneuvers and [ __ ]

1653.0 --> 1658.039
like that would normally not be possible

1655.4 --> 1659.0
but only work because of the magnetic

1658.039 --> 1661.1
gloves

1659.0 --> 1662.539
kind of thing you know it would be

1661.1 --> 1665.4189999999999
pretty cool

1662.539 --> 1666.44
I'd be interested to see those kind of

1665.419 --> 1669.44
things

1666.44 --> 1671.3600000000001
right so why not why do you have to use

1669.44 --> 1673.039
it to [ __ ] around with people and make

1671.36 --> 1676.6399999999999
them believe that certain people are

1673.039 --> 1680.919
like superheroes with magical powers

1676.64 --> 1680.919
why couldn't you just update the sport

1689.84 --> 1695.12
I mean like referee technology with like

1693.14 --> 1698.8400000000001
the lasers and

1695.12 --> 1701.059
and uh height yeah the super effective

1698.84 --> 1703.6999999999998
camera systems and all that that's been

1701.059 --> 1706.58
updated why wouldn't the game itself

1703.7 --> 1709.5800000000002
why couldn't it be updated too with tech

1706.58 --> 1712.4189999999999
to just make it more spectacular

1709.58 --> 1712.4189999999999
honestly

1732.62 --> 1737.6
okay well I didn't really follow Sports

1735.26 --> 1738.799
I don't know how much it has influenced

1737.6 --> 1743.3799999999999
I'm just

1738.799 --> 1743.3799999999999
ushering an idea like you could just

1744.52 --> 1749.72
change the game

1747.2 --> 1752.8400000000001
it's like there's two

1749.72 --> 1755.179
like durable courses of actions

1752.84 --> 1757.4599999999998
the course of actions that you can take

1755.179 --> 1760.8200000000002
with it with those Sports and that is

1757.46 --> 1763.46
either you stop [ __ ] around with like

1760.82 --> 1766.34
magnetic gloves and secret [ __ ] and you

1763.46 --> 1769.3400000000001
just make the game straight forward

1766.34 --> 1772.34
like the old-fashioned Style

1769.34 --> 1775.039
or you update the entire rules of the

1772.34 --> 1777.98
game to to allow those things to be used

1775.039 --> 1780.34
and that will change the way the game

1777.98 --> 1783.08
works eventually but it will be

1780.34 --> 1785.6589999999999
interesting and new

1783.08 --> 1788.299
perhaps you never really know how it go

1785.659 --> 1791.98
it's like a thing they could do it would

1788.299 --> 1791.98
actually draw a new attention

1794.539 --> 1800.74
sports are tiny burglars what well

1798.08 --> 1800.74
genderly

1803.5 --> 1807.039
nobody cares

1821.0 --> 1826.12
unless the entire surface of the boho

1823.399 --> 1826.12
was magnetic

1827.299 --> 1831.1589999999999
yeah well it probably is

1834.159 --> 1839.48
I mean you could literally like within

1837.26 --> 1845.02
the very fabric of the bowl

1839.48 --> 1845.02
put like little shards of of metal

1846.399 --> 1850.899
it's not that difficult to do that

1851.24 --> 1859.24
gloves yeah but that will be extremely

1853.88 --> 1859.24
messy except happy so that's not durable

1860.08 --> 1864.86
balls made with Mac no why are you why

1863.36 --> 1867.5
would you say that the ball has the

1864.86 --> 1869.6589999999999
magnet what if the gloves have the

1867.5 --> 1870.919
magnet if the ball has the magnet then

1869.659 --> 1872.419
anybody could

1870.919 --> 1874.94
like

1872.419 --> 1878.2
besides like magnetism doesn't do good

1874.94 --> 1881.8400000000001
with shock impact yeah those balls

1878.2 --> 1883.3990000000001
continually having shock impact I mean

1881.84 --> 1885.1399999999999
it

1883.399 --> 1886.82
I don't think that's how it works I

1885.14 --> 1888.0200000000002
think the magnets are actually in the

1886.82 --> 1891.2
gloves

1888.02 --> 1893.4189999999999
and the ball contains little fragments

1891.2 --> 1897.7
of metal enough

1893.419 --> 1897.7
to make the gloves stick to them

1901.279 --> 1905.899
because metal is not gonna stop being

1903.559 --> 1909.62
magnetic just because it gets a lot of

1905.899 --> 1912.559
stress and shock to it magnets do they

1909.62 --> 1916.12
do stop getting magnetic when you get a

1912.559 --> 1916.12
lot of shocks applied to them

1919.36 --> 1922.52
okay

1920.96 --> 1924.98
sure

1922.52 --> 1927.74
if it's electromagnets well it's going

1924.98 --> 1929.419
to be much harder to have a device in a

1927.74 --> 1932.0
ball

1929.419 --> 1934.5800000000002
doing that and and not making the ball

1932.0 --> 1936.679
unbalanced yeah so even more reason if

1934.58 --> 1940.1
you want to turn it on and off well then

1936.679 --> 1943.64
you definitely want it on in your glove

1940.1 --> 1946.059
and not in a ball which has to be in

1943.64 --> 1946.0590000000002
balance

1950.84 --> 1955.34
[Music]

1952.64 --> 1958.179
ship into football

1955.34 --> 1958.1789999999999
okay

1968.12 --> 1972.1999999999998
that's weird though like where's it

1970.22 --> 1974.539
getting its battery like do they put

1972.2 --> 1976.88
batteries in there like

1974.539 --> 1978.52
I mean magnetism that you want to turn

1976.88 --> 1981.0390000000002
on and off that's called

1978.52 --> 1985.6399999999999
electromagnetism electromagnetism

1981.039 --> 1987.74
requires power power requires battery

1985.64 --> 1989.72
battery

1987.74 --> 1991.179
is have weight

1989.72 --> 1995.2
weight

1991.179 --> 1995.2
unbalances a ball

1997.82 --> 2003.1
I mean for reals like

2000.64 --> 2005.94
this does not seem

2003.1 --> 2005.9399999999998
logical

2012.82 --> 2017.399
extremely small but yeah but would they

2015.159 --> 2017.3990000000001
last

2018.64 --> 2021.519
it's cool that there's very small

2020.019 --> 2023.799
Batteries Now what that doesn't mean

2021.519 --> 2025.539
that they could have gigantic amounts of

2023.799 --> 2027.399
power in very small batteries that's

2025.539 --> 2030.779
gonna last very long

2027.399 --> 2030.779
that wouldn't make any sense

2030.88 --> 2034.2
for one game yeah

2034.419 --> 2038.8600000000001
I mean we're talking about an

2036.24 --> 2040.179
electromagnet okay this is not a

2038.86 --> 2042.9399999999998
calculator

2040.179 --> 2045.24
it's an electromagnet that requires some

2042.94 --> 2045.24
power

2052.419 --> 2057.6389999999997
I don't know if look

2055.359 --> 2060.0989999999997
theoretically you could really design

2057.639 --> 2061.78
the ball smart enough that you'd have

2060.099 --> 2064.3590000000004
like

2061.78 --> 2068.28
the way distributed property but I mean

2064.359 --> 2068.2799999999997
man that is so convoluted

2074.98 --> 2079.659
I guess with enough or cold potential

2077.859 --> 2083.3199999999997
that people would

2079.659 --> 2085.899
would design it like that I guess

2083.32 --> 2088.06
it's ridiculous though

2085.899 --> 2090.22
anyway I got the Illuminati Castle here

2088.06 --> 2093.0
I'm going to Chow Down on that

2090.22 --> 2093.0
woohoo

2097.56 --> 2100.69
[Music]

2108.4 --> 2113.2000000000003
yeah Moxie you might be able to fit a

2111.16 --> 2115.42
car battery in a basketball but it's not

2113.2 --> 2117.66
gonna bounce anymore after that now is

2115.42 --> 2117.66
it

2124.359 --> 2126.5989999999997
okay

2128.22 --> 2135.8999999999996
besides shaking up a car battery

2132.579 --> 2135.9
might be a little risky

2155.98 --> 2159.839
mm-hmm yeah Richie

2183.86 --> 2186.9190000000003
[Music]

2195.46 --> 2198.06
ah

2198.46 --> 2202.96
yeah also got a Gusto I already got a

2201.099 --> 2205.2400000000002
sip of it

2202.96 --> 2208.06
I needed that because it makes you wake

2205.24 --> 2210.52
up and I really need that I had a great

2208.06 --> 2214.74
sleep by the way though

2210.52 --> 2217.98
and I mean I can definitely testify that

2214.74 --> 2222.0
smoking cannabis that does not

2217.98 --> 2222.0
necessarily suppress dreams

2222.64 --> 2227.2
I mean you could argue that when you

2225.16 --> 2229.06
first start smoking especially if you're

2227.2 --> 2232.1189999999997
younger

2229.06 --> 2235.119
it will do that but it's because of

2232.119 --> 2237.4
sheer sedation because of how much

2235.119 --> 2241.06
impact it will make like in the time

2237.4 --> 2243.82
when you get really freaking stoned dude

2241.06 --> 2246.94
I can't move oh oh that like really

2243.82 --> 2249.52
sound yeah if it has that much impact on

2246.94 --> 2250.78
you then it probably will like disrupt

2249.52 --> 2253.18
your dreams

2250.78 --> 2257.02
so you don't get any

2253.18 --> 2259.24
but I don't have those experience at all

2257.02 --> 2262.359
I haven't had those types of experience

2259.24 --> 2265.0
since I was a teen

2262.359 --> 2267.7
after that it kind of stopped and I did

2265.0 --> 2271.859
get dreams a little bit at first

2267.7 --> 2271.859
and but now it's like pretty elaborate

2272.32 --> 2276.6400000000003
yesterday too had a very long dream in

2274.78 --> 2280.5
this time as well

2276.64 --> 2280.5
and it's themed it's just that

2281.2 --> 2286.8999999999996
it's weird man

2283.78 --> 2289.7200000000003
because I'm noticing that I'm having

2286.9 --> 2291.339
very elaborate dreams I'm noticing how

2289.72 --> 2294.9399999999996
elaborate they are

2291.339 --> 2297.339
but I can't remember what they are I can

2294.94 --> 2299.56
only remember the structure of it and

2297.339 --> 2303.54
not the content

2299.56 --> 2303.54
that's a really weird realization

2305.859 --> 2313.74
so it's like I know how much happened

2310.119 --> 2313.7400000000002
kind of what the setup was

2313.9 --> 2319.38
but I can't actually remember like the

2316.54 --> 2319.38
experience itself

2322.54 --> 2326.2
but I mean it's more common among people

2324.4 --> 2329.02
that if they have dreams that there's

2326.2 --> 2331.2999999999997
like a weird filter on it and that they

2329.02 --> 2334.079
just can't remember certain aspects but

2331.3 --> 2334.079
this seems to be

2334.48 --> 2338.26
how it happens with me like I can still

2336.52 --> 2339.7599999999998
remember the structure it's like I could

2338.26 --> 2344.2000000000003
literally see it right in front of me

2339.76 --> 2347.5600000000004
but I can't put it into a story

2344.2 --> 2351.46
because I me I'm missing the data

2347.56 --> 2354.839
of the actual linear story memory

2351.46 --> 2354.839
from first perspective

2355.0 --> 2358.38
but the rest is there

2358.839 --> 2364.2
and thereby do I know that I had a very

2361.24 --> 2364.2
elaborate dream

2371.38 --> 2377.92
and not bad by the way

2374.92 --> 2380.2000000000003
I sometimes I think that like demons

2377.92 --> 2381.579
don't really come anymore because I'm

2380.2 --> 2384.359
the demon now

2381.579 --> 2384.3590000000004
in there

2386.44 --> 2389.5
like there's things there and there's

2388.24 --> 2391.7799999999997
people

2389.5 --> 2393.64
and I'm not like oh I'm the demon now I

2391.78 --> 2395.7400000000002
am nasty no that's not what I meant it

2393.64 --> 2398.56
meant that

2395.74 --> 2399.8199999999997
what they originally were doing to me in

2398.56 --> 2403.119
the dream

2399.82 --> 2405.46
I like kind of mastered that so it

2403.119 --> 2409.7400000000002
doesn't work anymore they can't do that

2405.46 --> 2409.7400000000002
and now I just have the control

2414.119 --> 2420.339
including over other entities

2417.28 --> 2423.3590000000004
like if there's some aspect in there

2420.339 --> 2423.359
that isn't mine

2423.52 --> 2427.68
then I get to bully them

2429.099 --> 2435.04
not really like dark bullying but it's

2432.76 --> 2436.96
basically I can push them around like I

2435.04 --> 2439.0
have the authority now or like the

2436.96 --> 2441.96
realization of the authority and so they

2439.0 --> 2441.96
can't do anything anymore

2447.82 --> 2454.92
so yeah when I dream in that dream world

2450.82 --> 2454.92
I feel very much in control

2456.88 --> 2460.2400000000002
what

2458.2 --> 2463.68
hello Brandon Cook

2460.24 --> 2463.68
and it's our time

2464.5 --> 2468.66
what the hell does Chinese have to do

2466.3 --> 2468.6600000000003
with anything

2477.52 --> 2482.859
dream talks yeah a little I'm just

2480.22 --> 2486.48
describing

2482.859 --> 2486.48
what my dreams were like

2491.98 --> 2496.079
it's like I think I'm like building a

2493.96 --> 2499.2400000000002
big project in there

2496.079 --> 2503.579
in ways it almost reminds me of like

2499.24 --> 2503.5789999999997
just watching Nathan play Minecraft

2503.92 --> 2508.119
like during the premieres I get to watch

2506.079 --> 2510.2200000000003
that like that it reminds me of like a

2508.119 --> 2511.78
World building but it is it's more

2510.22 --> 2514.2999999999997
complicated than that because it does

2511.78 --> 2517.5600000000004
have to do with spirits

2514.3 --> 2517.5600000000004
and the outside world

2520.56 --> 2527.7
so in ways it's almost like I'm turning

2523.72 --> 2527.7
my dream world into a computer game

2532.42 --> 2537.46
like in ways I think you can actually do

2535.78 --> 2539.92
that

2537.46 --> 2542.98
like you can

2539.92 --> 2544.06
designate the rules of the functions of

2542.98 --> 2547.119
things

2544.06 --> 2550.0
that you literally simulate in the dream

2547.119 --> 2552.94
like you can actually assign mechanical

2550.0 --> 2556.42
rules and functions to things

2552.94 --> 2559.26
once you realize that you can do that

2556.42 --> 2559.26
thank you

2559.66 --> 2564.72
yes you do not agree what are you

2562.24 --> 2564.72
talking about

2567.7 --> 2573.359
was Nathan too harsh to deal no not too

2571.0 --> 2573.359
harsh

2575.859 --> 2580.0
Dell was acting like a complete [ __ ]

2578.5 --> 2582.94
spaz

2580.0 --> 2584.8
and he deserved everything he got I mean

2582.94 --> 2587.5
it is literally his own stupid

2584.8 --> 2590.619
pig-headedness and got them into that

2587.5 --> 2593.579
[ __ ] and he deserved every word of it

2590.619 --> 2593.579
and more

2594.28 --> 2599.8
I mean some people you just gotta bash

2596.74 --> 2601.8999999999996
in the face until they stop moving

2599.8 --> 2604.42
Dell is one of those people

2601.9 --> 2607.42
and that's exactly what he got

2604.42 --> 2607.42
metaphorically

2611.81 --> 2614.909
[Music]

2615.76 --> 2621.46
we're doing words hey Brandon Cook could

2619.18 --> 2626.14
you perhaps

2621.46 --> 2628.9
make some logical consistent sense

2626.14 --> 2631.5989999999997
that you're talking about

2628.9 --> 2634.06
huh

2631.599 --> 2636.7000000000003
you got three sentences that are

2634.06 --> 2638.2
completely incoherent

2636.7 --> 2640.24
yeah

2638.2 --> 2642.04
Chinese what the hell do they have to do

2640.24 --> 2645.16
with anything never brought that up

2642.04 --> 2646.839
today they oh yes I do not agree with

2645.16 --> 2649.54
the what what the [ __ ] are you talking

2646.839 --> 2652.2999999999997
about More Than Words

2649.54 --> 2655.119
I doubt it yeah yeah oh yeah you're

2652.3 --> 2657.6400000000003
you're a little uh little crazy today

2655.119 --> 2660.46
aren't you Brandon Cook

2657.64 --> 2661.96
little incoherent today did you get

2660.46 --> 2664.06
triggered

2661.96 --> 2666.28
by Dell's treatment

2664.06 --> 2669.839
so you're a little incoherent now

2666.28 --> 2669.8390000000004

he should delete his channel and get the

2933.16 --> 2939.5789999999997
[ __ ] out of here you [ __ ] in in

2936.579 --> 2942.1600000000003
genuine

2939.579 --> 2947.6800000000003
[ __ ] [ __ ]

2942.16 --> 2951.359
you pathetic wannabe bully [ __ ]

2947.68 --> 2951.359
really [ __ ] pathetic

2953.859 --> 2960.0
I mean that level of behavior brings out

2956.619 --> 2960.0
the eugenics in me

2960.099 --> 2966.099
you think wow if people can get that

2962.44 --> 2969.9
terrible then maybe there is a proper

2966.099 --> 2969.9
reason for eugenics to exist

2971.8 --> 2974.3390000000004
foreign

2986.68 --> 2989.68
okay

2991.599 --> 2994.8590000000004
when did that happen Terry

2999.64 --> 3005.4
must have been a busy night

3002.76 --> 3008.48
but yeah I don't know who chandraian is

3005.4 --> 3008.48
no idea

3026.24 --> 3031.859
RV hates Dell as well well I I didn't

3029.7 --> 3033.8999999999996
hate him

3031.859 --> 3036.24
I just thought he's a guy just that has

3033.9 --> 3039.48
a lot of feelings but I mean he's also

3036.24 --> 3044.04
an arrogant [ __ ] scumbag

3039.48 --> 3047.64
and like when a lying snake like he will

3044.04 --> 3050.64
like his ego is ruthless and he will

3047.64 --> 3053.16
literally humiliate himself to the

3050.64 --> 3056.46
maximum possible level

3053.16 --> 3059.0989999999997
just to hold on and to be vengeful he's

3056.46 --> 3060.359
a really a pathetic drudgy

3059.099 --> 3064.1400000000003
scumbag

3060.359 --> 3067.0989999999997
like really disgusting no you're

3064.14 --> 3067.0989999999997
disgusting

3067.38 --> 3075.119
yeah you should have yourself committed

3072.0 --> 3078.98
for that level of [ __ ] up

3075.119 --> 3078.98
that you subject yourself to

3079.68 --> 3085.319
get yourself checked man

3082.5 --> 3088.98
yeah not knowing when to back down when

3085.319 --> 3093.079
you really should have backed down yeah

3088.98 --> 3096.119
I mean that level of stubbornness

3093.079 --> 3099.3590000000004
historically you know what that does

3096.119 --> 3101.76
it gets your loved ones killed you

3099.359 --> 3104.0989999999997
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah that's what that

3101.76 --> 3106.3390000000004
typically does when you're that [ __ ]

3104.099 --> 3109.92
stubborn yeah that's what then happens

3106.339 --> 3113.2999999999997
historically you [ __ ] idiot

3109.92 --> 3113.3
hope it's worth it

3118.64 --> 3121.75
[Music]

3133.619 --> 3139.619
what the [ __ ] what

3136.94 --> 3141.359
what the hell who the [ __ ] are you what

3139.619 --> 3145.2200000000003
the [ __ ] you want

3141.359 --> 3145.22
is this your soccer count or something

3145.38 --> 3148.46
why don't you [ __ ] off

3152.819 --> 3157.819
I don't care Aaron Armstrong you're a

3155.7 --> 3157.819
dick

3160.559 --> 3164.3
how many times I have to tell you

3172.82 --> 3175.8590000000004
[Music]

3185.22 --> 3187.3999999999996
thank you

3189.72 --> 3195.68
okay whatever yeah Moon vehicle sure

3192.18 --> 3195.68
I've never heard of it though

3201.359 --> 3208.339
I guess that Brandon Cook and all these

3204.0 --> 3208.339
[ __ ] are all a bunch of Dell slaves

3209.22 --> 3214.52
a bunch of dangle berries following him

3212.28 --> 3214.52
around

3214.559 --> 3220.02
following that [ __ ] [ __ ] that's too

3216.839 --> 3222.54
lazy to wipe his own ass

3220.02 --> 3224.88
so they follow him around

3222.54 --> 3226.8
totally get it

3224.88 --> 3228.839
so they're very stressed because Dell

3226.8 --> 3231.3
literally got himself absolutely

3228.839 --> 3233.94
demolished yesterday

3231.3 --> 3236.52
more than just argumentatively I mean

3233.94 --> 3238.68
[ __ ] himself emotionally too

3236.52 --> 3242.339
because he's a stubborn [ __ ] [ __ ]

3238.68 --> 3244.44
that has no self-control he doesn't have

3242.339 --> 3247.88
self-control to save his own [ __ ]

3244.44 --> 3247.88
life he's that pathetic

3261.059 --> 3263.78
foreign

3269.819 --> 3276.72
so he gets a [ __ ] grip on himself

3273.599 --> 3280.38
and it makes an elaborate show

3276.72 --> 3280.3799999999997
yeah confessing

3284.46 --> 3289.28
or you could go [ __ ] himself forever

3310.8 --> 3315.92
I don't know hello blue pill Devolution

3312.72 --> 3315.9199999999996
I don't know who that is

3332.16 --> 3337.5
I don't know who Dell is it's from the

3334.98 --> 3340.7400000000002
imaginary girth it's that

3337.5 --> 3342.96
barely coherent Scotsman with his

3340.74 --> 3344.7599999999998
ramblings he's the guy that got in my

3342.96 --> 3347.94
chat the other day and then started to

3344.76 --> 3351.599
accuse me of using Narnia Magic

3347.94 --> 3354.38
when I talked about relative density

3351.599 --> 3354.38
that guy

3354.66 --> 3358.6189999999997
should you be concerned well if you

3357.0 --> 3362.18
don't know him then you probably don't

3358.619 --> 3362.1800000000003
care about him so no

3362.339 --> 3367.22
LFC oh the concave guy

3367.38 --> 3370.04
huh

3377.579 --> 3383.04
did he die well he was had a pretty

3380.52 --> 3385.52
[ __ ] up life so it was an effective

3383.04 --> 3385.52
Criminal

3393.24 --> 3397.7
he died in prison well surprise surprise

3403.02 --> 3408.0
I mean yeah it happens yeah when you

3405.9 --> 3409.92
literally start spouting that you're the

3408.0 --> 3411.78
Christ return and you're a [ __ ]

3409.92 --> 3415.079
murderer

3411.78 --> 3416.94
yeah you're gonna find some people that

3415.079 --> 3419.76
don't take kindly

3416.94 --> 3422.3
do that sort of blasphemy and I will

3419.76 --> 3422.3
[ __ ] you up

3423.72 --> 3430.0789999999997
okay hey hey [ __ ]

3427.2 --> 3431.8799999999997
hey there hey Brandon Cook [ __ ] band

3430.079 --> 3433.2000000000003
[ __ ]

3431.88 --> 3435.0
huh

3433.2 --> 3437.04
[ __ ] [ __ ]

3435.0 --> 3439.819
now you get the [ __ ] out of here and you

3437.04 --> 3439.819
don't come back here

3449.76 --> 3454.98
it's hard and lungs and stuff

3452.94 --> 3457.859
yeah

3454.98 --> 3460.04
are you saying he died from a shot or

3457.859 --> 3460.04
something

3464.52 --> 3467.96
did he die suddenly

3493.98 --> 3500.46
you're sure he got it oh my God

3496.92 --> 3504.54
he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] then Jesus Christ

3500.46 --> 3506.4
and not him he definitely not Jesus

3504.54 --> 3508.8
Christ I mean you really think Jesus

3506.4 --> 3510.48
would be [ __ ] [ __ ] enough to take

3508.8 --> 3513.96
the shot

3510.48 --> 3516.059
no no he'd literally be rather crucified

3513.96 --> 3519.02
again

3516.059 --> 3519.02
then do that

3527.16 --> 3534.319
ah hey BKK Dave it's been a while

3530.7 --> 3534.319
yeah that idiot

3539.22 --> 3545.3999999999996
well I'm not super surprised a bit weird

3542.52 --> 3548.359
also because I did actually see him in

3545.4 --> 3548.359
my Dark World Vision

3548.64 --> 3555.359
and I immediately rejected him

3552.599 --> 3557.88
because because of his [ __ ] concave

3555.359 --> 3560.16
idiocy and it's just magical thinking

3557.88 --> 3563.28
and it's not physics based it's all

3560.16 --> 3564.859
[ __ ] [ __ ] concavors are like

3563.28 --> 3567.9
genuinely

3564.859 --> 3570.54
provably [ __ ]

3567.9 --> 3572.19
worse

3570.54 --> 3574.98
worse than Glovers

3572.19 --> 3577.7400000000002
[Music]

3574.98 --> 3580.26
globers are [ __ ] by really dumb [ __ ]

3577.74 --> 3582.0
that's based on them not knowing how

3580.26 --> 3584.88
things work

3582.0 --> 3587.4
the concave model is just straight out

3584.88 --> 3589.1400000000003
[ __ ] you in your face like if you ask

3587.4 --> 3592.02
how it works

3589.14 --> 3594.24
you're not gonna have it like it's it is

3592.02 --> 3596.4
literally dependent on you just being

3594.24 --> 3600.2
straightforward [ __ ] and that you

3596.4 --> 3600.2000000000003
believe whatever somebody says

3601.859 --> 3608.5989999999997
I can't stand concavors I'd rather have

3604.319 --> 3608.599
ballers in my Jet and I do

3609.0 --> 3613.619
yeah

3611.22 --> 3616.5589999999997
and the only concaver that

3613.619 --> 3619.559
manages to stick around without turning

3616.559 --> 3622.28
into an ass wipe is George Samford

3619.559 --> 3625.02
because he thinks that for some

3622.28 --> 3627.2400000000002
inexplicable idiotic reason probably

3625.02 --> 3629.16
religious related

3627.24 --> 3632.66
or maybe that's what his grandpa told

3629.16 --> 3632.66
them or whatever I don't know

3639.14 --> 3643.02
his name

3640.92 --> 3647.299
aristarchus

3643.02 --> 3647.299
you're not concave wait you're not

3653.16 --> 3655.64
whatever

3657.0 --> 3660.68
am I mixing him up with somebody

3665.099 --> 3669.6600000000003
excuse me

3666.78 --> 3672.42
who was that then who was that guy not

3669.66 --> 3676.14
not Jason McCormack I mean

3672.42 --> 3678.299
you stopped doing that a while ago but

3676.14 --> 3680.22
am I mixing George Sanford up with

3678.299 --> 3684.619
somebody else

3680.22 --> 3684.6189999999997
it's another non-wrench person then

3684.96 --> 3690.119
or maybe George Sanford just gets weird

3687.599 --> 3691.559
double personality sometimes I don't

3690.119 --> 3695.839
know what the [ __ ] going on but I'm

3691.559 --> 3695.8390000000004
pretty sure that you I catch you saying

3697.46 --> 3704.52
oh there you go yeah

3702.18 --> 3706.44
yeah so you're very special you're a

3704.52 --> 3709.559
special boy earther

3706.44 --> 3712.7400000000002
whatever it is it's not what everybody

3709.559 --> 3715.44
says it is isn't it yeah yeah yeah so

3712.74 --> 3717.359
you are that concave you have actually

3715.44 --> 3721.04
said that

3717.359 --> 3721.04
yeah Special boy Arthur

3724.799 --> 3728.819
you got your own ideas but you're not

3726.66 --> 3731.46
gonna tell anybody because then they'll

3728.819 --> 3733.2
tell you how that's impossible and

3731.46 --> 3735.18
exactly why and that'll make you feel

3733.2 --> 3736.859
stupid and you just want to be free to

3735.18 --> 3739.44
believe whatever the [ __ ] you want even

3736.859 --> 3742.2799999999997
if it makes no [ __ ] sense don't you

3739.44 --> 3742.28
George Sanford

3765.44 --> 3772.4
he probably took it himself because he's

3769.2 --> 3772.3999999999996
a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3772.799 --> 3778.04
LSC

3774.48 --> 3778.04
he probably took it

3778.38 --> 3783.839
like a weenie

3781.859 --> 3785.52
it's all Bluster man everything it is

3783.839 --> 3789.24
all blustery because Underneath It All

3785.52 --> 3792.18
it was just a dumb [ __ ] [ __ ]

3789.24 --> 3795.18
the guy was a like a very scattered

3792.18 --> 3795.18
personality

3804.48 --> 3810.119
and yeah Kevin k

3807.599 --> 3813.42
deny geometry yeah but it's

3810.119 --> 3815.7000000000003
it's not super hard right if you just

3813.42 --> 3817.799
don't investigate and you just dream and

3815.7 --> 3819.54
then oh look here's the pieces of the

3817.799 --> 3821.7
dream that's what you get handed it's

3819.54 --> 3822.72
always the same pieces

3821.7 --> 3825.48
right

3822.72 --> 3828.299
in the ball religion is a religion of

3825.48 --> 3830.579
just enjoy it and don't think about it

3828.299 --> 3832.92
too much that's how it works and it

3830.579 --> 3835.8590000000004
works so well because

3832.92 --> 3837.48
there's this Universal sandbox of How

3835.859 --> 3839.94
It's all built

3837.48 --> 3842.94
and it's all out there you you get the

3839.94 --> 3846.0
whole story basically from all sides

3842.94 --> 3848.04
so that you can build your part of that

3846.0 --> 3851.18
dream with

3848.04 --> 3851.18
that's why it works

3854.42 --> 3857.96
yeah no [ __ ]

3859.04 --> 3863.54
entertaining

3860.88 --> 3863.54
is

3869.88 --> 3876.1800000000003
I'm sorry but when you literally become

3872.64 --> 3878.7599999999998
a open cult leader like that

3876.18 --> 3880.98
there's nothing entertaining there's

3878.76 --> 3884.119
nothing entertaining that's left that's

3880.98 --> 3884.119
safe to assimilate

3937.02 --> 3941.0
Okay Kevin what are you talking about

3944.46 --> 3950.18
people watch my show get you Kevin get

3947.94 --> 3950.18
what

3957.48 --> 3961.44
who was that other crazy guy who set up

3960.0 --> 3964.2
in a meeting

3961.44 --> 3966.42
with narc sorry well it's Mark Sergeant

3964.2 --> 3968.7599999999998
I did actually watch it

3966.42 --> 3972.7400000000002
Mark Sergeant yesterday he's still doing

3968.76 --> 3972.7400000000002
things on YouTube and he had this show

3972.78 --> 3978.7200000000003
with somebody else

3975.299 --> 3980.339
audio only like a radio show and it's he

3978.72 --> 3981.839
always does the same types of things he

3980.339 --> 3984.0
had a whole bunch of reviews about games

3981.839 --> 3985.68
too in it but I listened to that

3984.0 --> 3988.2
yesterday

3985.68 --> 3990.5389999999998
I mean Mark Sergeant just does the same

3988.2 --> 3993.0589999999997
thing in the same way

3990.539 --> 3996.0
and keeps dynamic

3993.059 --> 3998.7000000000003
but I mean he does the the way he does

3996.0 --> 4001.64
interviews and all that is exactly the

3998.7 --> 4004.64
same as it was in 2015 it hasn't changed

4001.64 --> 4007.5389999999998
a bit he's just doing the same format

4004.64 --> 4007.5389999999998
effectively

4008.98 --> 4012.09
[Music]

4015.319 --> 4020.44
what throwing Budweiser on his part

4017.78 --> 4020.44
Jesus

4021.74 --> 4027.0989999999997
yeah so he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] I thought

4024.859 --> 4027.0989999999997
so

4054.319 --> 4060.14
yeah Kevin K but you got to realize that

4057.44 --> 4063.2000000000003
oh yes no no that's the thing when

4060.14 --> 4066.44
Ballers say what evidence that's them

4063.2 --> 4069.5589999999997
virtue signaling their dementia

4066.44 --> 4071.18
yeah they don't want to know it they

4069.559 --> 4073.4
want to live in a world where there is

4071.18 --> 4076.0389999999998
no evidence and so whatever evidence you

4073.4 --> 4078.799
bring they just forget about it again

4076.039 --> 4081.3190000000004
and they'll remember it when you re-show

4078.799 --> 4083.9
it to them they just don't want to

4081.319 --> 4086.0589999999997
recognize it actually exists

4083.9 --> 4087.619
so they can always keep saying but what

4086.059 --> 4090.2000000000003
evidence

4087.619 --> 4092.0
it's just what they do that's what

4090.2 --> 4094.96
happens when you're a religious fanatic

4092.0 --> 4094.96
that never lets go

4096.5 --> 4099.5
foreign

4117.799 --> 4123.38
blurry Horizons you can't work on it yet

4121.699 --> 4126.919999999999
blurry

4123.38 --> 4129.14
now it's the location it's not blurry

4126.92 --> 4131.299
it's where is it

4129.14 --> 4134.179
where are you seeing something

4131.299 --> 4136.219
what angular position in relation to the

4134.179 --> 4139.52
Observer huh

4136.219 --> 4143.02
and like hey yeah oh wow

4139.52 --> 4143.02
oh you can see something

4143.38 --> 4147.7390000000005
very far away right above the Horizon

4146.66 --> 4151.339
there

4147.739 --> 4155.379999999999
yeah though if you're looking at a ball

4151.339 --> 4155.38
it shouldn't look like that at all

4158.62 --> 4163.5199999999995
so technically it doesn't even matter

4160.94 --> 4168.46
whether it's blurry all that matters is

4163.52 --> 4168.46
is the Horizon geometric or not

4168.679 --> 4176.14
in accordance to the globe model claim

4173.0 --> 4176.14
well it isn't

4176.779 --> 4182.839000000001
so it doesn't matter if it's blurry or

4179.96 --> 4184.64
not it only matters where it's roughly

4182.839 --> 4187.94
at

4184.64 --> 4190.52
and whether that comports to

4187.94 --> 4193.94
the geometry

4190.52 --> 4197.719
of the globe and it doesn't and only has

4193.94 --> 4200.0599999999995
to not do that one time

4197.719 --> 4202.58
even though it's done that many times in

4200.06 --> 4204.7390000000005
order to basically prove that it's not

4202.58 --> 4207.26
the ball Geometry The Horizon is not

4204.739 --> 4208.58
geometric it doesn't compared to the

4207.26 --> 4210.8
cloud model

4208.58 --> 4212.96
it's an apparent effect

4210.8 --> 4214.9400000000005
and sometimes the Horizon can be very

4212.96 --> 4218.26
far away or relatively close by

4214.94 --> 4218.259999999999
depending on the conditions

4218.42 --> 4228.26
but far away close by not

4222.699 --> 4230.178999999999
high low no it's far away close by

4228.26 --> 4234.08
not high low

4230.179 --> 4237.8
yeah doesn't go low it doesn't do that

4234.08 --> 4240.199
at best if you zoom in on a decently

4237.8 --> 4242.719
refracted Horizon

4240.199 --> 4245.0599999999995
then it might look on a very little

4242.719 --> 4247.88
window if you're zoomed in bit like oh

4245.06 --> 4249.92
it's going on like this oh oh it's it's

4247.88 --> 4251.78
going over the horizon yeah but that's

4249.92 --> 4255.02
like this micro

4251.78 --> 4257.659
tiny little spot on the giant flat plane

4255.02 --> 4259.159000000001
that it kind of looks like that

4257.659 --> 4262.04
yeah

4259.159 --> 4264.08
so yeah even though that one part you

4262.04 --> 4266.56
zoom in on

4264.08 --> 4269.9
in this giant view that it's actually

4266.56 --> 4272.54
just a small fragment of it might look

4269.9 --> 4275.179
like it's a little curved there

4272.54 --> 4279.699
but that's still not geometrically gonna

4275.179 --> 4279.6990000000005
fit the overall actual picture

4279.86 --> 4283.0
that you're gonna see

4283.04 --> 4290.0199999999995
if you zoom out again

4285.199 --> 4290.0199999999995
so the Horizon simply is not geometric

4290.06 --> 4295.280000000001
yeah in accordance to the spherical

4292.46 --> 4296.3
model and that's just done it's Black

4295.28 --> 4299.36
Swan

4296.3 --> 4302.42
it's not geometric

4299.36 --> 4305.12
it's Optical it's an effect

4302.42 --> 4307.159
it's a side effect of sight of the

4305.12 --> 4309.14
angular

4307.159 --> 4311.36
side effects

4309.14 --> 4316.06
site itself

4311.36 --> 4316.0599999999995
there's a resolution limit

4318.679 --> 4325.719
and that resolution limit will determine

4321.02 --> 4325.719
how far you can see effectively

4325.82 --> 4329.719
because the farther it is the smaller

4328.159 --> 4331.5199999999995
it's going to be due to angular size

4329.719 --> 4334.28
decrease

4331.52 --> 4336.26
It comes naturally with distance

4334.28 --> 4339.98
so the higher

4336.26 --> 4342.56
your resolution of your site

4339.98 --> 4345.139999999999
the further you can see because you'll

4342.56 --> 4347.96
still be able to make out the tiny

4345.14 --> 4350.719
details that are in the distance

4347.96 --> 4353.659
and that's how it works

4350.719 --> 4356.08
higher the resolution the farther The

4353.659 --> 4356.08
Horizon

4357.44 --> 4362.62
lower the resolution The Closer by The

4360.26 --> 4362.62
Horizon

4369.4 --> 4374.839999999999
yes Kevin K indeed

4372.62 --> 4376.28
it is very hard to figure it out but

4374.84 --> 4378.56
it's also because they've been

4376.28 --> 4380.9
indoctrinated with just the idea of a

4378.56 --> 4383.6
globe and how is it a globe when you're

4380.9 --> 4386.48
constantly staring at that you're gonna

4383.6 --> 4387.679
be confused about the actual mechanics

4386.48 --> 4390.82
of Optics

4387.679 --> 4390.82
in the real world

4394.94 --> 4400.82
no that's [ __ ] saps happy I time you

4398.239 --> 4402.5599999999995
out for that normally if I

4400.82 --> 4405.159
didn't realize you were just really

4402.56 --> 4405.159000000001
desperate

4408.5 --> 4413.32
guys of my Globe shattering argument

4417.26 --> 4420.8
have I looked at it why would I look at

4419.78 --> 4426.099999999999
it

4420.8 --> 4426.1
I got plenty of photographs to look to

4426.8 --> 4432.8
yeah and all of them

4430.4 --> 4435.799999999999
yeah none of them have geometric

4432.8 --> 4438.56
Horizons none of them

4435.8 --> 4439.6990000000005
I mean even sound believes [ __ ]

4438.56 --> 4442.88
footage

4439.699 --> 4446.0
doesn't have a geometric Horizon

4442.88 --> 4447.26
it just kinda looks like that a little

4446.0 --> 4449.179
bit

4447.26 --> 4452.900000000001
but if that would actually be a

4449.179 --> 4455.2390000000005
geometric Horizon again it would be

4452.9 --> 4458.48
Planet Missouri

4455.239 --> 4461.799999999999
because that geometric Horizon would be

4458.48 --> 4461.799999999999
way too much

4461.84 --> 4469.52
yeah even if the Horizon where geometric

4465.62 --> 4471.5599999999995
you wouldn't be able to see it that much

4469.52 --> 4474.92
in that way

4471.56 --> 4476.6
you would mostly just not see mountains

4474.92 --> 4482.719
in the back ever

4476.6 --> 4485.06
you'd see more Blue Sky closer to your

4482.719 --> 4488.3
ground level to your horizon yeah

4485.06 --> 4491.1990000000005
because now the Horizon is a hill that's

4488.3 --> 4494.06
in the way you should see more blue sky

4491.199 --> 4496.879999999999
right behind it yet we never really see

4494.06 --> 4500.3
you doing we see the blue sky above the

4496.88 --> 4502.76
Horizon and near the Horizon it becomes

4500.3 --> 4504.9800000000005
more grayish whitish right because

4502.76 --> 4508.6990000000005
you're now looking through all that air

4504.98 --> 4513.139999999999
over all that long horizontal distance

4508.699 --> 4515.659
yeah well if we're on a globe

4513.14 --> 4518.4400000000005
The Horizon should be geometric and

4515.659 --> 4522.32
you're going to be looking at dead blue

4518.44 --> 4525.199
sky right behind it because when you're

4522.32 --> 4527.659
all the way over there at that geometric

4525.199 --> 4531.82
Horizon guess what everything tilts up

4527.659 --> 4534.86
and that should be blue sky directly

4531.82 --> 4537.739
behind it because it's geometric yeah

4534.86 --> 4540.4
and that never happens

4537.739 --> 4540.4
ever

4540.98 --> 4545.659
yeah you can trick yourself into

4543.679 --> 4548.179
thinking that some visual spectacle

4545.659 --> 4551.839999999999
shows you a curve

4548.179 --> 4554.659
but if you can look further Beyond

4551.84 --> 4557.78
you'll see that it isn't that it's just

4554.659 --> 4560.679
a local visual effect actual refraction

4557.78 --> 4565.5199999999995
yeah because actual refraction

4560.679 --> 4567.62
displaces objects things substance like

4565.52 --> 4569.659000000001
waves of an ocean

4567.62 --> 4574.699
it will displace

4569.659 --> 4577.58
those visuals in relation to the horizon

4574.699 --> 4579.259999999999
but it does not displace The Horizon

4577.58 --> 4580.82
because the Horizon is not an object

4579.26 --> 4583.64
it's in effect

4580.82 --> 4585.92
it's an effect that has more to do with

4583.64 --> 4587.4800000000005
the lens of the optical medium

4585.92 --> 4590.3
perceiving it

4587.48 --> 4593.718999999999
then what's going on out there

4590.3 --> 4597.08
right so refraction can displace visuals

4593.719 --> 4599.6
of objects and substance in relation to

4597.08 --> 4602.8
the Horizon but it does not displace The

4599.6 --> 4606.26
Horizon because the Horizon is not a

4602.8 --> 4609.320000000001
object it's not a geometry

4606.26 --> 4612.26
it's a effect that takes place because

4609.32 --> 4614.38
of the optical media

4612.26 --> 4614.38
thank you

4621.32 --> 4624.42
[Music]

4638.48 --> 4643.218999999999
all right so yeah you could probably see

4640.76 --> 4645.38
like oh look at that oh wow it looks so

4643.219 --> 4649.159
curved yeah but it's just you're zooming

4645.38 --> 4651.5
in on one little part in a gigantic hole

4649.159 --> 4654.98
that looks a little bit curved

4651.5 --> 4657.679
and then you in your mind you take that

4654.98 --> 4659.36
one thing and then you make it all the

4657.679 --> 4661.58
world around yeah but if you zoom out

4659.36 --> 4664.159
guess what it doesn't look like that

4661.58 --> 4666.44
it's just that one [ __ ] part that was

4664.159 --> 4669.32
zoomed in on that makes you think it's

4666.44 --> 4671.36
all like that no but that's actual a

4669.32 --> 4675.92
little piece of refraction that

4671.36 --> 4678.5599999999995
displaces the material there visually in

4675.92 --> 4681.4400000000005
relation to the horizon

4678.56 --> 4684.14
even if you can't see the actual Horizon

4681.44 --> 4686.62
further back

4684.14 --> 4686.62
okay

4691.34 --> 4695.360000000001
because if you look even carefully in

4693.44 --> 4696.379999999999
soundcloud's footage then you can see

4695.36 --> 4698.719
that

4696.38 --> 4701.32
there's a mountain range basically right

4698.719 --> 4701.32
behind it

4703.46 --> 4706.82
so it seems like oh it's going curving

4705.679 --> 4709.76
down

4706.82 --> 4712.219
but over here there's clearly a

4709.76 --> 4714.4400000000005
continuation so that you can see that it

4712.219 --> 4716.9
just seems to bend like that because of

4714.44 --> 4718.339999999999
refraction but that behind it yeah a bit

4716.9 --> 4721.04
blurred up but

4718.34 --> 4723.02
it still fits even the towers that it's

4721.04 --> 4724.88
actually a straight line getting

4723.02 --> 4726.679
refracted

4724.88 --> 4729.32
and that it will continue on if there

4726.679 --> 4731.9
would be more clarity in the air you

4729.32 --> 4733.759999999999
would see that it would continue further

4731.9 --> 4737.0
into the distance

4733.76 --> 4740.360000000001
in a straight line in relation to the

4737.0 --> 4742.34
first part the closer up lines you will

4740.36 --> 4745.46
see it does actually continue that's

4742.34 --> 4749.6
just refraction that at that last visual

4745.46 --> 4752.179
part makes it seem to bend down

4749.6 --> 4754.719
but then it's actually continuing

4752.179 --> 4754.719
straight

4755.199 --> 4760.339999999999
the whole thing is like every time they

4758.12 --> 4761.719
say oh refraction makes it look flat no

4760.34 --> 4763.64
that's not what refraction does

4761.719 --> 4768.38
refraction does exactly the opposite

4763.64 --> 4771.1990000000005
refraction makes it look a little curved

4768.38 --> 4773.719
that's what refraction actually does it

4771.199 --> 4776.36
makes it look a little curved

4773.719 --> 4779.54
more of a fraction more apparent

4776.36 --> 4782.0
curvature not actual curvature

4779.54 --> 4784.34
that's what refraction does refraction

4782.0 --> 4786.08
doesn't actually make it look flat it

4784.34 --> 4788.179
does the opposite it makes it look a

4786.08 --> 4790.9
little curved

4788.179 --> 4793.88
yeah that's why when it's a clear day

4790.9 --> 4799.58
minimum refraction you get to see things

4793.88 --> 4803.92
how they really are very very flat

4799.58 --> 4803.92
with the Horizon being very far away

4804.32 --> 4809.84
because it's flat because if it wasn't

4806.48 --> 4813.199
flat you would never see the Horizon

4809.84 --> 4817.400000000001
very very far away it would always be

4813.199 --> 4821.36
limited by the spherical geometry

4817.4 --> 4823.759999999999
you could never see a horizon beyond the

4821.36 --> 4826.94
geometric Horizon

4823.76 --> 4830.08
no matter the optical effect

4826.94 --> 4830.08
it's impossible

4844.82 --> 4849.799999999999
no

4847.1 --> 4852.92
no refraction doesn't block

4849.8 --> 4854.06
refraction displaces in relation to the

4852.92 --> 4856.82
horizon

4854.06 --> 4859.6
refraction bends the visuals it doesn't

4856.82 --> 4859.599999999999
block anything

4860.3 --> 4864.92
the resolution limit is the thing that

4862.94 --> 4867.379999999999
eventually blocks it

4864.92 --> 4870.4400000000005
makes you not pick up things anymore

4867.38 --> 4872.900000000001
because it's too small for your

4870.44 --> 4875.48
resolution to catch it

4872.9 --> 4877.699
it's a diffraction limit that eventually

4875.48 --> 4879.919999999999
cuts off site

4877.699 --> 4884.5599999999995
in that sense

4879.92 --> 4884.56
the fraction limit resolution limit

4890.56 --> 4896.080000000001
refractions the thing that makes

4892.76 --> 4899.2390000000005
whatever visual is inside very far away

4896.08 --> 4902.719
it makes it look bent

4899.239 --> 4904.759999999999
that's what refraction does

4902.719 --> 4907.159
you see less with refract yeah that's

4904.76 --> 4909.860000000001
what I said it makes things Bend

4907.159 --> 4911.78
and it cuts off the Horizon if also if

4909.86 --> 4913.9
it if there's a lot of it because of

4911.78 --> 4913.9
that

4923.239 --> 4926.32
okay fair enough

4936.32 --> 4940.699
just a demonstration of refraction yeah

4938.54 --> 4942.56
that is definitely a demonstration but

4940.699 --> 4945.98
it's not non-linear refraction because

4942.56 --> 4949.04
if the medium is like circular

4945.98 --> 4952.218999999999
the banding is not just refraction basic

4949.04 --> 4954.679
refraction is only really normally

4952.219 --> 4957.7390000000005
perceived when the transition medium is

4954.679 --> 4960.86
flat if the transition medium is round

4957.739 --> 4963.08
you get much worse

4960.86 --> 4965.599999999999
then you get really warped and then

4963.08 --> 4968.42
magnified

4965.6 --> 4971.0
[ __ ] that you see

4968.42 --> 4972.9800000000005
right if the surface of the refracting

4971.0 --> 4976.82
medium is

4972.98 --> 4979.299999999999
not straight you get like weird lensing

4976.82 --> 4979.299999999999
effects

4982.82 --> 4986.299999999999
because what refraction does is

4984.56 --> 4988.580000000001
basically it just

4986.3 --> 4990.62
given it you have the median transition

4988.58 --> 4993.14
you have the entry angle of the light

4990.62 --> 4995.9
and then the corner

4993.14 --> 4998.659000000001
with which it changes it it changes the

4995.9 --> 5000.759999999999
angle of approach that's literally

4998.659 --> 5003.879999999999
refraction within Optics negative

5000.76 --> 5007.2390000000005
approach angle of exit right

5003.88 --> 5010.96
and it requires a hard cut medium

5007.239 --> 5014.379999999999
separation for that refraction corner to

5010.96 --> 5016.78
be distinct like that because if the

5014.38 --> 5018.6990000000005
medium transition is vague

5016.78 --> 5023.4
and like

5018.699 --> 5023.4
gradual it's not going to work like that

5025.06 --> 5032.56
right and if the surface of the median

5029.14 --> 5035.679
transition is not straight well then you

5032.56 --> 5038.14
get even beside any kind of refraction

5035.679 --> 5040.3
index Corner change it's also going to

5038.14 --> 5045.52
have weird warping

5040.3 --> 5047.4400000000005
and lensing effect usually magnification

5045.52 --> 5049.2390000000005
but that would eventually like make

5047.44 --> 5051.099999999999
everything all focused so you will not

5049.239 --> 5053.32
be able to see anything beyond it at

5051.1 --> 5055.54
some point

5053.32 --> 5058.679
just because that surface wasn't

5055.54 --> 5058.679
perfectly flat

5063.54 --> 5068.219
refraction is a pretty bizarre effect

5069.4 --> 5072.36
what it can do

5084.04 --> 5089.38
that's right refraction can't make you

5087.04 --> 5093.34
see around corners

5089.38 --> 5096.34
all it can do is displace objects

5093.34 --> 5099.64
in relation to the horizon

5096.34 --> 5101.9800000000005
so it can obscure things it cannot

5099.64 --> 5104.08
reveal things that are naturally

5101.98 --> 5107.259999999999
obscured

5104.08 --> 5111.4
it can't bring back things from Beyond

5107.26 --> 5113.679
the Horizon or below it or around the

5111.4 --> 5116.199
corner

5113.679 --> 5118.3
but it can make things that are normally

5116.199 --> 5120.159
like behind a wall

5118.3 --> 5121.4800000000005
that you have a straight line aside on

5120.159 --> 5125.199
it could

5121.48 --> 5127.839999999999
refract it and then disappear what you

5125.199 --> 5130.36
normally see behind it

5127.84 --> 5132.400000000001
yeah it can refraction can make things

5130.36 --> 5136.839999999999
disappear visually

5132.4 --> 5139.179
but it cannot reveal things that

5136.84 --> 5144.179
normally would not be visible

5139.179 --> 5144.179
that's something refraction can never do

5145.38 --> 5151.54
the only way you can ever do such things

5148.719 --> 5155.14
is with actual mirrors

5151.54 --> 5158.41
only mirrors make you able to see around

5155.14 --> 5160.0
the corner and that's just a fact

5158.41 --> 5163.12
[Music]

5160.0 --> 5166.08
no refraction effect can make you see

5163.12 --> 5166.08
around the corner

5171.719 --> 5176.92
I might

5173.56 --> 5180.46
yeah maybe if you get a complex like

5176.92 --> 5182.1990000000005
Crystal tube you might be able to do

5180.46 --> 5184.6
that but it would still warp everything

5182.199 --> 5185.98
so yeah you instead of a mirror you

5184.6 --> 5188.860000000001
could use basically like different

5185.98 --> 5191.62
blocks of glass

5188.86 --> 5193.48
to have like a multi-step refraction

5191.62 --> 5198.699
effect that could

5193.48 --> 5201.82
do that but I mean yeah it would still

5198.699 --> 5205.0599999999995
the more refraction alteration takes

5201.82 --> 5207.159
place the more data is distorted

5205.06 --> 5211.2390000000005
so even though you could use like

5207.159 --> 5213.58
multiple segment refraction to go around

5211.239 --> 5216.638999999999
in a curved path

5213.58 --> 5219.04
what eventually is able to be seen on

5216.639 --> 5223.3
the other side behind the corner

5219.04 --> 5225.219
on your end is going to be much less

5223.3 --> 5227.7390000000005
it's going to be less you're never going

5225.219 --> 5229.719
to see as crystal clear as if you were

5227.739 --> 5231.459999999999
just looking around the corner

5229.719 --> 5232.78
when there's no data loss because

5231.46 --> 5235.06
there's a direct line of sight

5232.78 --> 5239.32
refraction multiple step refraction

5235.06 --> 5242.860000000001
definitely makes you lose information

5239.32 --> 5244.599999999999
you see it it lowers down inequalities

5242.86 --> 5247.299999999999
just like if you were say if you're

5244.6 --> 5249.820000000001
going to save a JPEG image

5247.3 --> 5251.7390000000005
on a really low resolution and then you

5249.82 --> 5254.86
open it up in Photoshop work on it again

5251.739 --> 5257.08
and then you save it again as a low

5254.86 --> 5259.12
resolution like there's information lost

5257.08 --> 5262.48
and it's going to get more grindy blurry

5259.12 --> 5265.42
colors gonna get off right because it's

5262.48 --> 5267.94
information loss well that happens too

5265.42 --> 5270.6
if you would go through multiple segment

5267.94 --> 5270.599999999999
refraction

5271.0 --> 5278.699
so there's another little detail

5274.42 --> 5278.6990000000005
that's good to know about within Optics

5279.76 --> 5284.139
right I mean you can look into an

5282.04 --> 5286.3
aquarium

5284.139 --> 5288.88
and then the refraction index of that

5286.3 --> 5291.6990000000005
glass and the water versus the air will

5288.88 --> 5293.62
definitely make you it make it sort of

5291.699 --> 5295.919999999999
enhanced and you look and it's like whoa

5293.62 --> 5299.679
the bottom is like

5295.92 --> 5301.2390000000005
not even with like the side you see the

5299.679 --> 5303.219
the aquarium box

5301.239 --> 5304.599999999999
and you're looking at the side and

5303.219 --> 5306.159
you're like ah there it is there's the

5304.6 --> 5308.5
line but then you look in and it goes

5306.159 --> 5310.48
like further down

5308.5 --> 5312.639
know how that's like that weird

5310.48 --> 5315.459999999999
enhancement makes it look bigger as it's

5312.639 --> 5317.82
further down that's what refraction does

5315.46 --> 5317.82
right

5327.28 --> 5331.62
now I lost my point what I was gonna say

5329.26 --> 5331.62
with that

5333.58 --> 5339.0599999999995
yeah now I remember but if that

5336.52 --> 5339.06
refraction

5339.96 --> 5346.06
like if the aquarium was huge let's just

5343.06 --> 5348.46
say you're going to the aquarium from

5346.06 --> 5350.5
Sea World or something right and they

5348.46 --> 5352.6
have like those big glass

5350.5 --> 5354.159
plates where you're standing at the

5352.6 --> 5357.219
water height and you're looking straight

5354.159 --> 5359.259999999999
into the gigantic water tank with like a

5357.219 --> 5362.32
whale bear or a dolphin

5359.26 --> 5365.56
well you don't really get to see the

5362.32 --> 5367.36
other end of the pool too much

5365.56 --> 5370.06
you know

5367.36 --> 5371.679
why because there's so much refraction

5370.06 --> 5373.2390000000005
happening

5371.679 --> 5377.56
the water is

5373.239 --> 5380.4
not as clear as the air

5377.56 --> 5384.159000000001
it's not as transparent as the it it

5380.4 --> 5386.739
reflects the the light too much and as a

5384.159 --> 5388.0
result you don't see as far through

5386.739 --> 5391.799999999999
water

5388.0 --> 5391.8
as you would see through air

5393.34 --> 5397.2390000000005
right

5395.02 --> 5399.400000000001
well that's the same basic that's that's

5397.239 --> 5402.36
basically the same effect as what I

5399.4 --> 5406.299999999999
tried to describe as like using

5402.36 --> 5408.82
multiple segment refraction systems

5406.3 --> 5411.820000000001
to try a look around the corner it would

5408.82 --> 5413.32
be just like looking through water a big

5411.82 --> 5415.78
chunk of it

5413.32 --> 5418.659
you can't just have like a brilliant

5415.78 --> 5420.94
oversight after to the Horizon and

5418.659 --> 5424.78
mountains in the distance because you're

5420.94 --> 5427.54
looking through very dense High

5424.78 --> 5431.159
refraction segments

5427.54 --> 5431.159
it's like looking through a water tank

5431.98 --> 5438.48
it's gonna make things not so clear on

5435.94 --> 5438.48
the other end

5444.159 --> 5447.36
oh [ __ ] yeah

5448.239 --> 5452.919999999999
it's just a [ __ ] correcting con

5450.52 --> 5454.780000000001
probably another Dell [ __ ] I mean Dell

5452.92 --> 5457.42
has a lot of demons

5454.78 --> 5460.599999999999
he's got like the worst pieces of crap

5457.42 --> 5464.76
he has like a goblin army

5460.6 --> 5464.76
you're that Dell you're the Goblin King

5465.28 --> 5469.86
maybe we should put up some makeup in a

5467.62 --> 5469.86
wig

5474.699 --> 5481.5599999999995
and go do a little Goblin song

5478.12 --> 5481.5599999999995
in your Asher Castle

5484.3 --> 5490.08
now David Bowie he can't catch up to

5487.3 --> 5490.08
David Bowie's

5490.9 --> 5495.099999999999
but seriously you're surrounded by

5492.94 --> 5497.5599999999995
goblins

5495.1 --> 5500.92
people that like you are all pieces of

5497.56 --> 5504.76
[ __ ] they're all [ __ ] trash

5500.92 --> 5504.76
and they're all like yeah

5505.84 --> 5511.679
but you don't understand anything

5508.36 --> 5511.679
it's just Bluster

5513.48 --> 5518.08
and there's plenty of people like that

5515.86 --> 5520.12
out there I guess because there's plenty

5518.08 --> 5523.26
people still following Dell despite him

5520.12 --> 5528.54
proving himself to be utterly

5523.26 --> 5531.06
cognitively utterly incompetent buffoon

5528.54 --> 5533.98
thank you

5531.06 --> 5535.54
so he's not the only one

5533.98 --> 5540.12
because there's still a lot of people

5535.54 --> 5540.12
following him after all of this

5548.139 --> 5552.0
oh [ __ ] time has flown

5552.76 --> 5556.1990000000005
what am I gonna call this show

5557.92 --> 5560.04
thank you

5561.04 --> 5564.54
any suggestions guys

5569.08 --> 5572.94
maybe a bit about dreams

5577.06 --> 5579.96
for a fraction

5582.93 --> 5586.02
[Music]

5589.57 --> 5597.5199999999995
[Music]

5601.69 --> 5608.669999999999
[Music]

5610.6 --> 5613.56
what about this

5613.72 --> 5616.829000000001
[Music]

5617.679 --> 5626.04
Del's Narnia magic dreams and the nature

5622.48 --> 5626.04
of refraction and the horizon

5628.9 --> 5634.5689999999995
what do you guys think

5631.51 --> 5634.569
[Applause]

5643.84 --> 5646.5
I know

5649.42 --> 5656.679
what causes petrification

5652.96 --> 5656.679
rapid deoxidization

5659.38 --> 5664.6
from what I heard

5661.84 --> 5670.56
like deprive something of oxygen

5664.6 --> 5670.56
intensely in a drowning way it's weird

5671.02 --> 5675.96
but you can make yeah lack of moisture

5673.6 --> 5675.96
no

5678.639 --> 5683.9800000000005
no it's lack of oxidation

5681.4 --> 5687.159
so if you put something in water but

5683.98 --> 5688.379999999999
with substances in that water that

5687.159 --> 5691.12
prevent

5688.38 --> 5692.9800000000005
oxygen reaction because there's oxygen

5691.12 --> 5695.86
in water too literally

5692.98 --> 5698.44
but it can be like stopped and then you

5695.86 --> 5699.699
basically put something in that type of

5698.44 --> 5703.379999999999
water

5699.699 --> 5703.379999999999
and then it petrifies

5704.08 --> 5709.96
it has to do with like inability to

5707.56 --> 5712.0
oxidize it's weird man it's really weird

5709.96 --> 5714.84
how it works

5712.0 --> 5714.84
but it does

5714.88 --> 5718.4800000000005
I'm not an expert at it this is what

5716.86 --> 5721.0599999999995
I've learned through other people's

5718.48 --> 5724.599999999999
videos and there's like

5721.06 --> 5728.620000000001
literal photographs of like

5724.6 --> 5730.900000000001
broken off feet in shoes that were

5728.62 --> 5731.98
petrified where you literally have a

5730.9 --> 5734.08
shoe

5731.98 --> 5736.839999999999
like a leather shoe that's completely

5734.08 --> 5739.12
petrified with a foot with a piece of

5736.84 --> 5741.639
bone sticking out of the foot the foot

5739.12 --> 5744.219
and the shoe both petrified

5741.639 --> 5745.36
and that's like not thousands of years

5744.219 --> 5747.1
ago

5745.36 --> 5749.139
that's like hundreds of years ago

5747.1 --> 5752.1990000000005
probably was a foot

5749.139 --> 5755.159000000001
like lost during some War

5752.199 --> 5755.159
in a swamp

5755.62 --> 5761.159
so petrification happens much quicker

5758.139 --> 5761.159000000001
than you might think

5761.38 --> 5766.96
but it typically happens in like a swamp

5765.46 --> 5771.219
because

5766.96 --> 5773.8
there's no Oxygen oxygenation

5771.219 --> 5776.86
there's no Oxygen reaction that can

5773.8 --> 5780.179
happen because it's being blocked

5776.86 --> 5780.179
and that's how it happens

5782.44 --> 5789.04
hope that answers your question

5785.8 --> 5792.34
man my chat is active today well this is

5789.04 --> 5795.28
great I wish I had some paypals though

5792.34 --> 5797.8
wasn't today a good show

5795.28 --> 5799.78
I would really like a PayPal reward it's
