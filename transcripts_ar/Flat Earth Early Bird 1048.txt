you're on camera

95.4 --> 98.299
and there you go

101.28 --> 106.979
yeah the weather today is cloudy

104.28 --> 109.979
winds blowing very fast you can

106.979 --> 113.52
literally see the clouds Rush by

109.979 --> 115.56
it was like that yesterday as well

113.52 --> 116.82
although there was a bit of sun here and

115.56 --> 118.88
there

116.82 --> 120.77999999999999
not so much rain

118.88 --> 125.82
surprisingly so

120.78 --> 128.75900000000001
and another thing that stood out is how

125.82 --> 132.48
it's yeah unbelievable

128.759 --> 137.23899999999998
unbelievably warm it actually is

132.48 --> 137.23899999999998
like it's not cold outside at all really

139.319 --> 143.11999999999998
and it was like that yesterday as well

145.5 --> 152.42
hello M first in chat

148.379 --> 152.42
and Brent M good to see you

152.879 --> 159.89999999999998
it is Wednesday the 20th of October 2021

164.519 --> 170.959
and yeah just gonna be doing a normal

168.0 --> 170.959
full show today

172.319 --> 175.879
yesterday was very short

176.58 --> 181.20000000000002
because yeah I already said at the

179.519 --> 183.84
beginning like I'm not feeling too great

181.2 --> 186.0
and yeah then eventually that kind of

183.84 --> 189.56
got to me so

186.0 --> 189.56
jumped under the shower

189.9 --> 194.9
and also had a long walk

195.239 --> 199.019
like through

196.92 --> 200.51899999999998
really nice path through the forest and

199.019 --> 202.86
all that

200.519 --> 205.58
and really try to walk it out and that

202.86 --> 205.58
worked great

205.799 --> 210.5
really helped me get rid of my nausea

214.14 --> 221.76
so and also went to bed very early

217.879 --> 226.099
and yeah really had a good rest this

221.76 --> 226.099
night and I feel much better

226.14 --> 230.39999999999998
it's only

227.519 --> 234.08
just minor minor shakiness still from

230.4 --> 234.08
yesterday because I did get sick

239.299 --> 244.09900000000002
very strange day yesterday for me

248.879 --> 253.7
right so let's see what is the

250.86 --> 253.70000000000002
temperature actually

259.739 --> 266.65999999999997
yeah it's 18 degrees

263.28 --> 266.65999999999997
I thought it was something like that

271.56 --> 274.16
right

276.78 --> 282.05999999999995
right yeah yesterday and evening I felt

279.54 --> 284.90000000000003
much better and I also joined

282.06 --> 284.9
Peewee live

285.36 --> 291.47900000000004
that's a bit rambly even

287.639 --> 294.68
but yeah that was an interesting show

291.479 --> 294.68
great to be part of it

302.46 --> 306.02
so how is everybody doing

347.16 --> 350.84000000000003
doing okay all right

361.55 --> 364.67900000000003
[Music]

367.62 --> 369.979
okay

371.699 --> 377.90000000000003
yeah me myself

373.979 --> 381.539
I've I've done better but like yesterday

377.9 --> 383.46
getting sick also like it it kind of

381.539 --> 387.919
forced me to

383.46 --> 387.919
deal with certain emotions and feelings

389.22 --> 392.46000000000004
and yeah I shared them pretty much with

391.5 --> 394.62
Adam

392.46 --> 397.44
so I don't know

394.62 --> 400.139
it's like the weather

397.44 --> 405.08
the Autumn or lots of leaves everywhere

400.139 --> 405.08
red and orange it is quite beautiful

406.86 --> 411.599
and it brings in all kinds of like

408.78 --> 415.69899999999996
memory associations and feelings and so

411.599 --> 415.699
yeah to go through some stuff

417.24 --> 422.16
I think yeah yeah the worst of it is

419.819 --> 426.139
over although it is it really that bad

422.16 --> 426.139
well yeah when you're in it it's just

428.16 --> 431.72
like it feels

433.259 --> 436.099
dramatic

444.66 --> 447.139
right

447.3 --> 452.28000000000003
but if you get an opportunity to express

449.819 --> 453.319
it some people do it through ART other

452.28 --> 456.29999999999995
through

453.319 --> 458.819
conversations or therapy

456.3 --> 459.72
and I was able to do that yesterday so I

458.819 --> 463.40000000000003
just

459.72 --> 468.86
found a place for it all

463.4 --> 468.85999999999996
and yeah hopefully it'll just be back to

468.96 --> 472.15999999999997
my usual self

493.259 --> 495.91900000000004
right

496.139 --> 500.36
you're very sensitive to the weather as

498.18 --> 500.36
well

502.62 --> 507.78000000000003
well I'd like to think that these are

505.62 --> 509.94
the ancestral wins that I was talking

507.78 --> 511.73999999999995
about a few weeks ago

509.94 --> 513.12
it's like it's coming the ancestral

511.74 --> 515.94
winds are coming

513.12 --> 518.039
and it's gonna bring changes and also

515.94 --> 520.86
experience changes for a lot of people

518.039 --> 524.539
that's gonna kind of force them to look

520.86 --> 524.539
at it from a different angle everything

525.0 --> 531.3
and it's confrontational so if there's

528.36 --> 534.0
things that you've taken on that you

531.3 --> 536.279
can't handle then you might go nuts over

534.0 --> 539.58
that

536.279 --> 541.14
and I think we were all kind of seeing

539.58 --> 542.94
the results

541.14 --> 546.54
in others

542.94 --> 549.5
if you know that

546.54 --> 549.5
I see it

550.74 --> 554.76
right some people get extra cranky and

553.56 --> 557.64
attack-ish

554.76 --> 559.98
very intolerant Others May get a little

557.64 --> 563.64
retracted

559.98 --> 567.0
maybe a little sentimental even right

563.64 --> 569.58
hey Gadget inspector

567.0 --> 571.68
funny I'm not getting alerts when you go

569.58 --> 574.58
live well do you have the Bell

571.68 --> 574.5799999999999
notification on

574.8 --> 579.7199999999999
I mean

577.019 --> 583.88
notification system from YouTube isn't

579.72 --> 583.88
exactly known for its reliability

587.399 --> 593.1
maybe many people in the past were Bell

590.04 --> 595.26
notified and then they suddenly just

593.1 --> 596.76
it was turned off without them even

595.26 --> 599.36
knowing it

596.76 --> 599.36
right

604.2 --> 608.519
Bon Jovi really

606.3 --> 610.3199999999999
now this is just my hair but it's also

608.519 --> 613.04
because I went under the shower

610.32 --> 613.0400000000001
yesterday and

615.839 --> 619.7
then didn't want it tied up

622.5 --> 627.32
yeah

623.64 --> 627.3199999999999
okay so you do have to bail on

627.48 --> 631.98
oh maybe you'll get the pop-up

629.22 --> 637.76
notification after the show's ended

631.98 --> 637.76
hmm hey hello Jamie Bruce Donato br

648.959 --> 654.5999999999999
used to have long hair too

651.6 --> 656.5790000000001
I've had long hair

654.6 --> 659.339
for half my life

656.579 --> 662.5999999999999
no more way more actually it's more like

659.339 --> 662.6
three quarters of my life

666.12 --> 671.64
I'm gonna try to hold on to it for as

669.0 --> 674.76
long as I can

671.64 --> 678.38
I hope at least another two decades but

674.76 --> 678.38
yeah we'll see what happens

681.6 --> 685.64
a America silver Patriot

693.779 --> 697.92
yeah it didn't have to be yeah I'm doing

695.64 --> 700.56
fine

697.92 --> 703.56
some slight shakiness left from

700.56 --> 705.9799999999999
yesterday yesterday was not great I was

703.56 --> 705.9799999999999
sickish

708.66 --> 715.76
but that worked out just fine

711.899 --> 715.76
literally had to walk it off

730.76 --> 736.04
what okay he got you inspector weird

736.43 --> 740.779
[Music]

738.66 --> 740.779
okay

741.84 --> 744.979
[Music]

756.36 --> 761.36
am I planning to join fed show on Friday

758.94 --> 761.36
yes

763.8 --> 769.76
but to be fair I do I am kind of

766.62 --> 769.76
appreciating the break

793.68 --> 798.42
all right

794.94 --> 800.72
yeah also been working on Benjamin good

798.42 --> 800.7199999999999
stuff

801.49 --> 804.509
[Music]

805.38 --> 812.869
uh

807.94 --> 812.869
[Music]

845.279 --> 849.0
right

846.6 --> 851.279
yeah I got you inspector I agree

849.0 --> 853.199
it's big enough a threshold to get them

851.279 --> 855.42
on in the first place although

853.199 --> 857.579
if he did it

855.42 --> 859.68
like a full unban

857.579 --> 862.199
then they would probably just try to

859.68 --> 865.579
Zerg him that that would not be

862.199 --> 865.579
effective either so

866.82 --> 872.1
right also I've been

868.74 --> 874.74
experiencing some weird issues

872.1 --> 876.66
that's my channel in the sense that

874.74 --> 879.48
there's several people that have tried

876.66 --> 883.2199999999999
to approach me tell me like hey

879.48 --> 883.22
I got banned a while back

883.8 --> 890.8199999999999
but I just can't find them in my lists

888.18 --> 892.68
so I don't know what's going on like why

890.82 --> 893.94
they why their comments are not showing

892.68 --> 897.5999999999999
up

893.94 --> 900.1800000000001
I've suspected that maybe

897.6 --> 902.519
maybe it has to do that some people in

900.18 --> 905.779
my chat that do have wrenches have

902.519 --> 905.779
people blocked

906.779 --> 913.8
right so everybody that is

909.72 --> 916.339
in my chat I'd ask you to please unblock

913.8 --> 916.3389999999999
people

918.12 --> 923.88
because if one moderator has somebody

921.72 --> 926.339
blocked then they are blocked from

923.88 --> 929.72
pretty much everywhere where

926.339 --> 929.72
where you have wrench

930.3 --> 934.3389999999999
very inconvenient system

942.12 --> 947.59
hey Eric airporting

944.48 --> 947.59
[Music]

963.32 --> 967.8000000000001

you want to get banned

969.48 --> 972.0790000000001
buddy

976.86 --> 980.839
this is a stupid rumor

980.88 --> 986.06
Nathan doesn't do that

983.04 --> 986.06
he really doesn't

989.699 --> 993.8389999999999
where do we look

991.44 --> 996.6
see if we block people uh you have to

993.839 --> 1000.62
look into the Google

996.6 --> 1003.16
thing let me try to find it

1000.62 --> 1003.16
uh

1006.86 --> 1012.4590000000001
Capital link somewhere but I don't

1009.38 --> 1012.459
usually go there

1036.799 --> 1039.579
hmm

1055.46 --> 1058.6000000000001
oh where's

1059.36 --> 1063.8799999999999
yeah it's not in the standard YouTube

1061.4 --> 1063.88
page

1076.82 --> 1082.7
ah right

1079.28 --> 1085.24
Google it's hangouts.google

1082.7 --> 1085.24
.com

1090.14 --> 1093.22
right in there

1093.38 --> 1100.419
you can go to settings more

1097.82 --> 1100.4189999999999
settings

1100.76 --> 1104.44
and then blocked people

1117.32 --> 1120.3999999999999
hope that helps

1126.14 --> 1128.14
um

1143.9 --> 1148.8200000000002
haven't you seen the yeah yeah last

1146.36 --> 1153.34
chance that was corporate

1148.82 --> 1153.34
it's [ __ ] Nathan doesn't do that

1157.94 --> 1163.8200000000002
he's actually addressed it right but you

1161.84 --> 1167.32
need to stop squirting over this it's

1163.82 --> 1167.32
really disgusting

1174.14 --> 1177.46

1437.659 --> 1443.3600000000001
of pretty heavy debate situation high

1441.559 --> 1446.059
tension

1443.36 --> 1449.08
you literally don't know what that was

1446.059 --> 1449.08
none of you do

1449.36 --> 1456.2199999999998
why don't you ask Nathan instead of

1452.12 --> 1456.2199999999998
fantasizing about this situation

1456.679 --> 1460.3600000000001
this is really disgusting

1469.46 --> 1471.64
foreign

1510.32 --> 1512.5
foreign

1516.44 --> 1520.3600000000001

very interesting video

1628.34 --> 1630.58
fun

1665.72 --> 1671.38

1668.36 --> 1671.3799999999999
working was it wow

1671.779 --> 1675.82
I thought it was very predictable

1673.46 --> 1675.82
actually

1676.7 --> 1680.8990000000001
I mean it's interesting to see it

1678.98 --> 1683.779
demonstrated like that

1680.899 --> 1686.26
but nothing that I didn't expect

1683.779 --> 1686.26
happened

1696.44 --> 1701.559
all right Dr John the uh I'll link him

1804.86 --> 1809.4189999999999
ah

1806.72 --> 1812.3600000000001
not like nauseated or anything it's just

1809.419 --> 1814.039
a few uncomfortable

1812.36 --> 1816.6789999999999
I don't know if I'm gonna make it the

1814.039 --> 1819.3799999999999
whole two hours without constantly going

1816.679 --> 1822.38
to the toilet

1819.38 --> 1822.38
laughs

1829.34 --> 1832.1789999999999
what's that

1835.88 --> 1840.5590000000002

1846.2 --> 1850.1200000000001
facts I saw that one

top 10 Flat Earth misconceptions

1859.46 --> 1863.019
so do check that one out

1906.08 --> 1909.08

did Randy do it I have no idea what

1942.08 --> 1944.899
you're talking about

1943.279 --> 1948.039
Gadget

1949.1 --> 1955.519
I mean did you bring that up yesterday

1950.96 --> 1957.7

1977.419 --> 1981.3990000000001
like

1978.679 --> 1981.3990000000001
ugh

1982.64 --> 1989.8600000000001
I remember those days that's like

1986.179 --> 1989.8600000000001
two and three years ago

2023.019 --> 2030.22
oh okay Gadget inspector huh

2025.899 --> 2033.82
that's hilarious no I dude I don't keep

2030.22 --> 2036.58
track of what he does at all

2033.82 --> 2038.98
only way I even find out anything is if

2036.58 --> 2041.32
you guys inform me about it or if

2038.98 --> 2044.94
something happened in hear about it

2041.32 --> 2044.9399999999998
through the Skype chat

2046.0 --> 2050.28
anyway I'll be right back in two minutes

2047.799 --> 2050.28
again

2061.839 --> 2064.02
foreign

2092.379 --> 2095.379
uh

2098.98 --> 2102.359
try again in a few

2113.14 --> 2117.18
that's hilarious slow-mo moon buggy

2131.619 --> 2136.38
unbanned Dr Gonzo no

2138.04 --> 2143.04
I don't want to unban Dr Gonzo thanks

2163.82 --> 2167.119
[Music]

2173.17 --> 2179.94
[Music]

2175.78 --> 2179.94
if I even have him then

2180.82 --> 2183.42
nope

2183.7 --> 2189.7599999999998
so either the search system is

2186.579 --> 2193.26
completely screwed up again

2189.76 --> 2193.26
or I don't have him banned

2194.74 --> 2201.339
right so I guess if that's the case then

2197.859 --> 2204.119
somebody has him blocked as well

2201.339 --> 2204.119
it's not me

2223.3 --> 2227.619
uh all right yeah Eric everybody thanks

2225.76 --> 2230.26
for popping by and

2227.619 --> 2232.119
yeah I'll be fine it's just a

2230.26 --> 2234.6600000000003
combination of the weather and

2232.119 --> 2234.6600000000003
everything

2235.0 --> 2239.32
right I'm a week off anyway what did I

2238.06 --> 2242.52
expect

2239.32 --> 2242.52
of course I'm gonna get sick

2243.4 --> 2247.599
I've literally been talking about how

2245.74 --> 2250.18
that typically happens

2247.599 --> 2252.7000000000003
especially to Workaholics

2250.18 --> 2255.3999999999996
and as soon as they decide to stop doing

2252.7 --> 2257.4399999999996
it or take a break or vacation yeah

2255.4 --> 2261.42
you get sick it used to happen to my

2257.44 --> 2261.42
mother all the time every time

2262.619 --> 2268.0
but I'll be all right

2266.26 --> 2270.8390000000004
if I ever twist at the end of my

2268.0 --> 2270.839
mustache

2270.94 --> 2277.18
I try not to mess with it

2273.94 --> 2280.859
I mean I do kind of do that but it's not

2277.18 --> 2280.859
really it doesn't really work out

2290.44 --> 2295.7200000000003
a steamy Traveler

2293.26 --> 2298.0
am I feeling yeah

2295.72 --> 2301.0789999999997
better than yesterday for sure but I'm

2298.0 --> 2301.079
still a little shaky

2363.76 --> 2369.1800000000003
right

2366.04 --> 2369.18
ah man

2375.87 --> 2379.15
[Music]

2412.9 --> 2417.579
said yesterday that I play video games

2415.18 --> 2418.8999999999996
uh

2417.579 --> 2421.0
yeah

2418.9 --> 2424.1800000000003
well I've always kind of been a video

2421.0 --> 2427.24
gamer since very young like the video

2424.18 --> 2430.4199999999996
games caught me and I've regretted that

2427.24 --> 2431.74
at times because it was too good in

2430.42 --> 2433.7200000000003
Escape

2431.74 --> 2437.4399999999996
to avoid

2433.72 --> 2440.6189999999997
like social anxiety issues when I was a

2437.44 --> 2442.3
kid because I definitely had those

2440.619 --> 2444.76
right

2442.3 --> 2448.5600000000004
but

2444.76 --> 2448.5600000000004
yeah I don't play as much now

2448.78 --> 2454.0
but yeah recently I started playing

2451.119 --> 2457.599
Pathfinder King maker

2454.0 --> 2459.099
which is an RPG based

2457.599 --> 2462.099
game

2459.099 --> 2465.2200000000003
like character yeah it's just our

2462.099 --> 2468.099
typical DND game Pathfinder based in

2465.22 --> 2470.56
this case and it's turning out to be

2468.099 --> 2472.119
very well developed

2470.56 --> 2476.819
and has

2472.119 --> 2476.819
real good music in parts

2482.859 --> 2489.7599999999998
there's definitely a certain song that I

2485.619 --> 2492.76
keep on even hearing The Echoes of it in

2489.76 --> 2495.4
my mind because it's really amazing

2492.76 --> 2497.6800000000003
and it's funny because I'm using it even

2495.4 --> 2500.44
as a test

2497.68 --> 2503.98
for my own well-being like I listen to

2500.44 --> 2507.579
it in my mind and then I

2503.98 --> 2510.7
can use it like a backdrop field test

2507.579 --> 2511.599
like how well I am am I responding to

2510.7 --> 2514.8999999999996
this

2511.599 --> 2516.339
which potentially arouses very high

2514.9 --> 2519.52
level of

2516.339 --> 2522.04
positive emotions in ways with a lot of

2519.52 --> 2525.52
dream associations how far can it touch

2522.04 --> 2528.64
me right now or am I blocked like

2525.52 --> 2529.72
yesterday I actually heard it echoing in

2528.64 --> 2532.359
my mind

2529.72 --> 2533.9199999999996
but it didn't help at all it was

2532.359 --> 2537.04
actually getting in my way and that's

2533.92 --> 2539.319
how I knew like I am not doing well

2537.04 --> 2541.599
when I start hearing music that I

2539.319 --> 2544.0
normally really love here I can hear it

2541.599 --> 2545.5
echoing in my mind but it's like a

2544.0 --> 2550.56
nightmare

2545.5 --> 2550.56
that's when I know okay this is not good

2568.599 --> 2573.7200000000003
it's all good now with the shadner

2570.7 --> 2573.72
frackers I don't know

2578.8 --> 2581.7000000000003
it's complicated

2689.8 --> 2692.7000000000003
what

2696.04 --> 2700.02
you'll get blapped what

2747.94 --> 2752.04
how am I today who's asking

2756.94 --> 2762.48
strange name for

2759.339 --> 2762.48
for a YouTube account

2778.119 --> 2781.859
me yeah no [ __ ]

2826.119 --> 2833.38
yeah Charles Stevenson well look the

2830.619 --> 2836.38
online gaming world is in my opinion

2833.38 --> 2839.859
pretty much ruined

2836.38 --> 2843.1600000000003
because the amount of

2839.859 --> 2846.88
not borderline but absolutely full

2843.16 --> 2849.94
Gammas that they play there's people out

2846.88 --> 2854.52
there that only play these types of game

2849.94 --> 2854.52
games if they can break the game

2856.839 --> 2862.54
like either

2859.0 --> 2864.339
through cheating or like finding inner

2862.54 --> 2866.2
loopholes whatever

2864.339 --> 2868.42
and they just want to break the games

2866.2 --> 2870.52
they want to ruin it for others that's

2868.42 --> 2873.7000000000003
like their only pleasure is to basically

2870.52 --> 2875.559
become so good that it'll discourage

2873.7 --> 2877.9199999999996
other people from playing that that's

2875.559 --> 2877.92
real

2878.859 --> 2881.04
foreign

2937.9 --> 2942.059
seems like the trolls have woken up

2947.02 --> 2949.2
foreign

3006.839 --> 3009.2
foreign

3016.44 --> 3019.65
[Music]

3026.819 --> 3029.819
foreign

3037.859 --> 3040.859
really

3046.02 --> 3051.3
that sounds like you're about to

3048.119 --> 3054.54
basically yeah it sounds like you're on

3051.3 --> 3057.3
the edge of a emotional breakdown it

3054.54 --> 3059.7
anyways that's what I've been through as

3057.3 --> 3062.099
well so

3059.7 --> 3066.24
when I get like that I try to step away

3062.099 --> 3070.7400000000002
from everything and well

3066.24 --> 3070.74
like have a long walk alone

3072.119 --> 3077.1800000000003
with nothing to reflect upon but nature

3074.819 --> 3077.18
and yourself

3082.26 --> 3088.079
and then I don't know if you can handle

3085.44 --> 3091.619
it even try to force some of the

3088.079 --> 3096.5
feelings more to the Forefront

3091.619 --> 3096.5
for yourself to deal with them right

3103.5 --> 3107.819
if you do that if you find the right

3105.599 --> 3110.6400000000003
moment for that

3107.819 --> 3113.04
and realize that just the breaking of

3110.64 --> 3114.839
the tension could reveal could literally

3113.04 --> 3117.0589999999997
make you sick

3114.839 --> 3119.819
because it's like tension that's built

3117.059 --> 3122.579
up if that's then suddenly

3119.819 --> 3126.0
tapped into like

3122.579 --> 3128.3390000000004
everything that was stuck behind that

3126.0 --> 3130.859
wall that you spiritually created is

3128.339 --> 3134.2799999999997
going to certainly come with it

3130.859 --> 3136.619
I can literally make you sick like like

3134.28 --> 3139.1400000000003
the experience can be almost like you

3136.619 --> 3140.94
got food poisoning even though it isn't

3139.14 --> 3144.92
it's purely

3140.94 --> 3144.92
like a psychosomatic backlash

3145.38 --> 3150.78
pure stress related

3147.96 --> 3154.579
in their psychological workings and the

3150.78 --> 3154.579
effect of it on your body so

3154.74 --> 3159.54
it'll be all right just trust me on this

3157.98 --> 3161.7
I've been through that sort of thing

3159.54 --> 3164.22
many times already

3161.7 --> 3167.3999999999996
it's kind of a bit unnerving to already

3164.22 --> 3169.04
have it at this age

3167.4 --> 3172.46
as in

3169.04 --> 3172.46
half my life

3173.94 --> 3180.859
but it's grown less bad less painful but

3178.02 --> 3180.859
more frequent

3192.42 --> 3194.96
hmm

3203.7 --> 3212.18
yeah so yeah good luck Isles G

3209.22 --> 3212.18
it'll be all right

3215.28 --> 3220.1600000000003
the most important thing is when you get

3217.68 --> 3220.16
like that

3220.26 --> 3225.7200000000003
don't get dragged Along by foolish ideas

3223.859 --> 3228.54
that come from

3225.72 --> 3230.819
emotions

3228.54 --> 3235.04
like when I get like that I get really

3230.819 --> 3235.04
dramatic and even like depressed

3235.38 --> 3239.339
and with that comes all kinds of ideas

3237.54 --> 3241.619
that I normally

3239.339 --> 3243.359
like wouldn't even consider allowing

3241.619 --> 3244.319
inside of my mind but I can't stop it

3243.359 --> 3246.5989999999997
then

3244.319 --> 3249.38
I just have to let it all play out and

3246.599 --> 3249.38
ignore it

3250.2 --> 3254.46
like let aryaman come close but not take

3253.26 --> 3258.2000000000003
anything

3254.46 --> 3258.2
it's quite a challenge

3289.799 --> 3292.46
what

3318.119 --> 3325.5
right yeah it works the best LG

3321.599 --> 3328.26
like bottle up emotions agitation

3325.5 --> 3330.42
physical right for some people they take

3328.26 --> 3331.2000000000003
it even harder and they go like chopping

3330.42 --> 3334.5
wood

3331.2 --> 3336.24
which is interesting because it is kind

3334.5 --> 3337.5
of the time of the year to do that right

3336.24 --> 3340.6189999999997
it is

3337.5 --> 3342.599
preparation for the winter time

3340.619 --> 3344.339
it's the end of the summer suddenly a

3342.599 --> 3346.319
lot of work especially if you're on a

3344.339 --> 3349.38
farm and everything a lot of work

3346.319 --> 3352.5
suddenly has to be done

3349.38 --> 3355.98
so yeah if you get all like

3352.5 --> 3359.46
want to attack something well attack

3355.98 --> 3361.68
would attack those blocks of wood to get

3359.46 --> 3365.52
firewood for example see

3361.68 --> 3368.339
it's like it really works out like that

3365.52 --> 3369.48
I even wonder sometimes if this type of

3368.339 --> 3373.319
stress

3369.48 --> 3377.64
for this period is specifically designed

3373.319 --> 3380.579
for us to start getting really active

3377.64 --> 3382.5589999999997
it's like yeah either you work or you

3380.579 --> 3385.1400000000003
sit in hell

3382.559 --> 3388.6800000000003
almost that kind of thing it's

3385.14 --> 3390.0
fascinating to think about it like that

3388.68 --> 3393.18
foreign

3390.0 --> 3395.839
literally chopping wood right now this

3393.18 --> 3395.839
is brilliant

3397.25 --> 3400.679
[Music]

3417.72 --> 3423.74
right just be careful you don't pull any

3419.819 --> 3423.74
muscles while you do it don't overdo it

3425.16 --> 3429.2
because then you're going to be even

3426.599 --> 3429.2000000000003
more sour

3445.619 --> 3452.28
praying indoor plants yeah clutch

3448.799 --> 3455.339
but that works for one side if you have

3452.28 --> 3456.96
like this weird impulse energy like a

3455.339 --> 3459.66
frustration

3456.96 --> 3462.059
like overactiveness that's kind of

3459.66 --> 3463.68
inconvenient then it doesn't really work

3462.059 --> 3465.5400000000004
then you really need to do something

3463.68 --> 3468.0
more physical

3465.54 --> 3471.42
and then after you get it like as they

3468.0 --> 3476.24
say out of your system then yes suddenly

3471.42 --> 3476.2400000000002
the plants and the praying helps

3481.859 --> 3486.9
that's why basically just

3483.799 --> 3487.92
therapeutically going out for a sturdy

3486.9 --> 3490.5
walk

3487.92 --> 3492.48
in a natural environment is really like

3490.5 --> 3494.579
a double situation you're getting

3492.48 --> 3495.9
physical to get it out

3494.579 --> 3498.1800000000003
and

3495.9 --> 3500.339
you do it in nature and then in the

3498.18 --> 3502.68
beginning it's very likely you're not

3500.339 --> 3503.52
you might look around but you won't see

3502.68 --> 3506.2799999999997
it

3503.52 --> 3508.38
you won't be able to let it in

3506.28 --> 3510.119
and then when you kind of like start

3508.38 --> 3512.4
they have walked and you get some

3510.119 --> 3514.6800000000003
emotions out that yeah that show

3512.4 --> 3516.299
themselves maybe you even get a person

3514.68 --> 3519.359
like a private

3516.299 --> 3520.98
cry about something right a loss that

3519.359 --> 3522.24
kind of happened a while ago or

3520.98 --> 3524.88
something you know that sort of thing

3522.24 --> 3528.1189999999997
starts to happen and then you get it out

3524.88 --> 3530.52
and then suddenly it's like wow I can

3528.119 --> 3533.2400000000002
see it again I can now see nature and

3530.52 --> 3533.24
then you know

3533.28 --> 3538.3190000000004
yeah

3534.54 --> 3541.5589999999997
you know you've gone through it

3538.319 --> 3543.299
I love that sort of test

3541.559 --> 3545.3390000000004
because it really stands out I paid

3543.299 --> 3547.559
specific attention to it yesterday it

3545.339 --> 3550.2599999999998
felt like really

3547.559 --> 3554.2400000000002
sick not depressed but sick

3550.26 --> 3554.2400000000002
like I can't handle this world

3554.64 --> 3559.2599999999998
like too stressed about everything and

3556.68 --> 3560.52
so I was just like walking walking and

3559.26 --> 3563.46
just

3560.52 --> 3565.14
like even the beauty of things was just

3563.46 --> 3568.26
too much it's just kind of staring at

3565.14 --> 3572.24
the ground and then at some point

3568.26 --> 3572.2400000000002
it finally like

3572.28 --> 3579.42
like the energy just flushed

3576.119 --> 3581.46
and then it's like wow

3579.42 --> 3583.26
look at this guy look at

3581.46 --> 3584.64
look at those

3583.26 --> 3588.8590000000004
beautiful

3584.64 --> 3588.859
colored leaves everywhere and

3589.2 --> 3596.819
and even just other people

3592.559 --> 3598.92
because other people like they're also

3596.819 --> 3600.839
doing something there I can like see

3598.92 --> 3602.819
their attention all of a sudden that

3600.839 --> 3604.619
they're doing kind of the same thing in

3602.819 --> 3606.42
their own way

3604.619 --> 3608.28
because a lot of people that do take

3606.42 --> 3610.559
walks in this type of weather they do

3608.28 --> 3611.8190000000004
have this sort of issue when they do

3610.559 --> 3614.6600000000003
that

3611.819 --> 3618.2599999999998
it's almost like a weird

3614.66 --> 3618.2599999999998
understanding about that

3618.299 --> 3625.619
like people don't seem as avoidant

3622.14 --> 3628.5589999999997
a little more vulnerable

3625.619 --> 3630.42
a little less like default deflective

3628.559 --> 3632.8190000000004
like they just don't care they're too

3630.42 --> 3635.4
distracted no no it's more it's very

3632.819 --> 3637.38
different atmosphere out there

3635.4 --> 3640.28
to all the people walking in the forest

3637.38 --> 3640.28
anyway

3655.14 --> 3661.64
okay guys inspector yeah

3658.26 --> 3661.6400000000003
you should get a little no

3661.68 --> 3665.64
I like dogs it's very funny that you

3664.14 --> 3668.5789999999997
said it actually because I think

3665.64 --> 3672.0
yesterday a dog actually

3668.579 --> 3676.079
did a healing spell on me

3672.0 --> 3678.96
I was in Peak tension I was so tense

3676.079 --> 3681.0
that I was walking and I actually almost

3678.96 --> 3681.839
fell asleep as I was walking but I

3681.0 --> 3684.559
couldn't

3681.839 --> 3684.5589999999997
lie down

3684.9 --> 3689.4
and this dog

3686.94 --> 3691.14
from the like a couple

3689.4 --> 3693.96
they were just sitting on a bench and

3691.14 --> 3697.52
this really nice dog I don't know what

3693.96 --> 3697.52
breed it was but it's like this

3698.04 --> 3706.14
it came walking up to me and it like hmm

3701.94 --> 3708.96
any like communicated that it felt how

3706.14 --> 3711.859
pain how much pain I had and came up to

3708.96 --> 3713.819
me like really trying to comfort me like

3711.859 --> 3716.46
overwhelming

3713.819 --> 3718.799
sensation like whoa that dog actually

3716.46 --> 3721.92
understands

3718.799 --> 3724.02
and then yeah after that moment I kind

3721.92 --> 3727.039
of that was for me when it really

3724.02 --> 3727.0389999999998
switched around

3727.68 --> 3731.96
it was the dog somebody's dog

3733.559 --> 3738.7200000000003
like they get it they get in their

3736.619 --> 3740.88
feeling struggle and even things like

3738.72 --> 3743.7799999999997
nausea from the stress and all that they

3740.88 --> 3743.78
dogs get that

3744.119 --> 3750.059
but I I don't want to have a dog myself

3748.319 --> 3753.619
I

3750.059 --> 3753.619
it's right here especially now

3757.38 --> 3762.619
your dogs know when you're not right

3759.18 --> 3762.6189999999997
yeah yeah yeah they do

3773.7 --> 3777.0789999999997
gross clutch

3783.539 --> 3790.2000000000003
besides like why would you do that

3786.66 --> 3793.16
clutch when you could actually use them

3790.2 --> 3793.16
for hunting

3796.92 --> 3800.66
okay now stop it

3804.539 --> 3809.46
no I'm not getting any Packer pet right

3807.72 --> 3812.5789999999997
now

3809.46 --> 3814.26
I already have like in the cat from the

3812.579 --> 3818.1800000000003

3814.26 --> 3818.1800000000003
who comes by like every day

3834.24 --> 3838.0789999999997
um

3835.92 --> 3839.339
oh that is awesome clutch yeah yeah I

3838.079 --> 3841.26
love that [ __ ]

3839.339 --> 3844.2
creating your own forest path yeah I

3841.26 --> 3846.539
used to do that in my old folks house

3844.2 --> 3850.5589999999997
because we had pretty

3846.539 --> 3853.7990000000004
yeah we had a decent sized Garden

3850.559 --> 3855.8390000000004
and yeah a lot of trees especially in

3853.799 --> 3858.92
the front part was like its own mini

3855.839 --> 3858.92
Forest on the Block

3859.559 --> 3864.9
and then I I would like try to like cut

3862.98 --> 3866.76
down the branches to make it in like

3864.9 --> 3868.92
this mystical path

3866.76 --> 3872.599
love that

3868.92 --> 3872.599
it's it's great

3881.94 --> 3887.9
you might get a parrot learn how to

3885.059 --> 3887.9
speak rumpus

3890.72 --> 3893.93
[Music]

3928.68 --> 3936.14
no Matthew Mitchell that's absolutely

3931.2 --> 3936.14
preposterous nobody does that

3939.96 --> 3946.38
that's the dumbest thing ever because

3943.5 --> 3951.0
like even theoretically

3946.38 --> 3953.88
however insane it even is to consider it

3951.0 --> 3956.599
doesn't work out because just the sheer

3953.88 --> 3956.599
wound

3956.94 --> 3962.819
and the shock is actually gonna cost you

3959.88 --> 3965.94
more then you're gonna get nutrition

3962.819 --> 3969.14

3965.94 --> 3969.14
total idiocy

3981.119 --> 3986.1600000000003
like

3982.799 --> 3989.0389999999998
it's much more efficient to just not eat

3986.16 --> 3991.2
for a very long time that actually works

3989.039 --> 3995.099
better right as long as you got

3991.2 --> 3997.98
at least a source of good water

3995.099 --> 4000.44
you can do very long with very little

3997.98 --> 4002.78
food there's never a need

4000.44 --> 4004.4
it's like literally not even in the

4002.78 --> 4005.6600000000003
desert

4004.4 --> 4007.28
right

4005.66 --> 4011.14

4136.819 --> 4139.719

okay

4193.04 --> 4195.819
huh

4197.0 --> 4204.02
well I rarely use PayPal for actual

4201.62 --> 4208.84
yeah paying for things

4204.02 --> 4208.84
I do I did used to use it

4209.36 --> 4215.239
but that yeah it started to basically

4212.48 --> 4219.4
exclude certain type of

4215.239 --> 4219.4
stores and all that very annoying

4233.719 --> 4236.14

things I don't know

4433.76 --> 4440.9800000000005
worse than before

4436.159 --> 4440.98
no jab no job but who enforces that

4443.0 --> 4447.44
like are they are there literally like

4445.34 --> 4450.7390000000005
police officers

4447.44 --> 4452.419999999999
like guarding over

4450.739 --> 4456.379999999999
shop and

4452.42 --> 4459.26
job owner yeah job places like you are

4456.38 --> 4463.84
you are not going to just let them work

4459.26 --> 4463.84
is it is it really come to that

4465.14 --> 4470.2390000000005
wow

4467.199 --> 4473.5599999999995
that that's

4470.239 --> 4473.5599999999995
totally insane

4481.04 --> 4487.64
that they're literally just forcing a a

4485.48 --> 4489.08
violent revolution then because that's

4487.64 --> 4491.1990000000005
the only way you're gonna get out of

4489.08 --> 4491.199
that

4491.48 --> 4497.62
and the people that help enforce it are

4494.42 --> 4497.62
like guilty

4499.159 --> 4505.12
there's no doubt about that

4501.739 --> 4505.12
it's going to be a bloody mess

4535.64 --> 4538.360000000001
really

4538.42 --> 4543.64
December 21st why why that date

4555.8 --> 4562.360000000001
okay yeah

4558.14 --> 4562.360000000001
I hope it's gonna be sooner

4562.88 --> 4568.34
the sooner the better like the longer

4565.1 --> 4570.76
you leave that sort of like

4568.34 --> 4574.4800000000005
gross

4570.76 --> 4574.4800000000005
societal violation

4576.92 --> 4583.28
police occupation

4580.159 --> 4585.5599999999995
the sooner you get that behind you the

4583.28 --> 4587.78
better because it's very demoralizing

4585.56 --> 4589.820000000001
and that like wears on everybody as you

4587.78 --> 4591.98
say it's draining so

4589.82 --> 4593.42
can't just

4591.98 --> 4595.339999999999
try to

4593.42 --> 4598.12
sit through it and hope it'll go away

because it won't

4605.719 --> 4609.9800000000005

4608.12 --> 4613.78
that's the last day of her state of

4616.04 --> 4621.56
you know because you can bet your bottom

Australian dollar that even if they say

4621.56 --> 4627.320000000001
oh karuna it's over then they will

4624.56 --> 4629.780000000001
literally roll out the next thing that

4627.32 --> 4631.88
they're gonna do it for like some

4629.78 --> 4633.5
climate change emergency they will just

4631.88 --> 4636.02
conjure

4633.5 --> 4638.12
whatever they want

4636.02 --> 4641.96
to keep continuing it

4638.12 --> 4644.12
it's almost a guarantee

4641.96 --> 4646.28
they've already announced like no we're

4644.12 --> 4649.659
never going to stop doing it like

4646.28 --> 4649.659

well

4722.12 --> 4727.4
with facts injury is not right when they

4725.54 --> 4732.199
should be filled

4727.4 --> 4734.839999999999
with police officers impaled by rakes

4732.199 --> 4736.28
and such that's what should be happening

4734.84 --> 4739.06
actually

4736.28 --> 4739.0599999999995

4739.699 --> 4744.879999999999
just taking the death shot is easier

4754.94 --> 4761.599999999999

4759.08 --> 4766.42
you know me or it's feel kind of stupid

4761.6 --> 4766.42
every time I say something like that

4774.739 --> 4780.5599999999995
you're still gonna outnumber these cops

finish him off

4810.739 --> 4818.5
right screw it all

4813.56 --> 4818.5
just show them like no

4829.1 --> 4834.56
but yeah I don't I'm not a great

4831.98 --> 4838.419999999999
tactician in that sense it's just my

4834.56 --> 4838.42
impulse it's just like I know it's there

4840.44 --> 4846.32
I know people can do that you can't

4842.9 --> 4847.94
really get the mob out of the human you

4846.32 --> 4850.219
can't

4847.94 --> 4852.62
but they have learned to make you

4850.219 --> 4855.199
suppress it for every conceivable reason

4852.62 --> 4859.159
it's like no no no no no we can just

4855.199 --> 4861.86
protest and do this and do that forever

4859.159 --> 4865.46
we just do that forever even though it's

4861.86 --> 4867.32
already showing that that's not working

4865.46 --> 4870.139
right

4867.32 --> 4873.0199999999995
like this thing is not gonna stop until

4870.139 --> 4875.0
a whole bunch of blood is spilled and

4873.02 --> 4876.9800000000005
when I talk about blood spill they don't

4875.0 --> 4880.4
make death from injections I mean

4876.98 --> 4885.44
literal blood being spilled

4880.4 --> 4887.54
because this is a chain spell a mind

4885.44 --> 4890.0
control chain spell a dominant spell

4887.54 --> 4891.62
you're all literally being degraded

4890.0 --> 4894.04
dehumanized

4891.62 --> 4897.699
and the only way that stops is through

4894.04 --> 4897.699
brutal bloodshed

4899.06 --> 4906.76
or a complete collapse

4902.78 --> 4906.759999999999
right but that's not the case

4906.92 --> 4913.219
like the financing of this

4910.34 --> 4916.400000000001
we'll just continue because it's outside

4913.219 --> 4918.86
like this is not a country

4916.4 --> 4921.08
for example in Australia it's not like

4918.86 --> 4923.0
the country is doing that because it's

4921.08 --> 4925.04
financially desperate

4923.0 --> 4926.9
it's doing it because there is a

4925.04 --> 4929.54
financial conspiracy going on they're

4926.9 --> 4934.04
being paid to do this

4929.54 --> 4937.5199999999995
and the the payers they have unlimited

4934.04 --> 4940.88
like they don't have any reason to stop

4937.52 --> 4943.6990000000005
it's not the same as like for example

4940.88 --> 4945.92
more typical old-fashioned communist

4943.699 --> 4948.199
system where they just start to get

4945.92 --> 4949.9400000000005
dominant because they can't actually pay

4948.199 --> 4953.178999999999
the bills

4949.94 --> 4954.86
because they're really more isolated

4953.179 --> 4956.0
right

4954.86 --> 4958.58
like

4956.0 --> 4960.199
more of Central America's

4958.58 --> 4962.0
all that

4960.199 --> 4964.78
that would typically have but that's not

4962.0 --> 4964.78
what this is

4969.26 --> 4976.4800000000005
it's a corporate financier hostile

4973.88 --> 4976.4800000000005
takeover

4976.58 --> 4982.78
and they will not stop until the ones

4979.88 --> 4988.04
that are the receivants of that money

4982.78 --> 4991.36
until they perish absolutely perish

4988.04 --> 4991.36
because they will not stop

4993.56 --> 4998.42
taking more time

4995.96 --> 5001.2390000000005
is not going to stop them

4998.42 --> 5005.1990000000005
doesn't work like that they're sieging

5001.239 --> 5007.599999999999
you you are not saging them

5005.199 --> 5010.719
right

5007.6 --> 5014.08
they don't run out a Siege only works

5010.719 --> 5017.08
when the besieged are going to run out

5014.08 --> 5018.4
they're not going to run out do you

5017.08 --> 5020.679
understand

5018.4 --> 5023.58
this is not the right approach you can't

5020.679 --> 5023.58
break them like this

5035.62 --> 5040.9
okay sicarious

5037.9 --> 5042.879999999999
well yeah well they're just gonna come

5040.9 --> 5045.82
after you

5042.88 --> 5048.6990000000005
right if you're not gonna stop them

5045.82 --> 5050.86
first they will just Slaughter all the

5048.699 --> 5052.419999999999
regular public

5050.86 --> 5056.0199999999995
one by one

5052.42 --> 5058.659
and then they'll be like oh it's all the

5056.02 --> 5061.120000000001
anti-vaxxers fault so they're literally

5058.659 --> 5066.04
going to then send SWAT teams in the

5061.12 --> 5069.94
woods to find you do you understand

5066.04 --> 5072.12
because they are not being besieged they

5069.94 --> 5076.239
are besieging you

5072.12 --> 5079.9
they have as much money in flux as you

5076.239 --> 5082.178999999999
can imagine without any stopping it

5079.9 --> 5084.94
for the foreseeable future

5082.179 --> 5088.02
they don't have a reason not to come

5084.94 --> 5088.0199999999995
after you do you understand

5091.42 --> 5096.12
yeah it's not a solution

5094.06 --> 5099.6990000000005
keep repeating it keep repeating it

5096.12 --> 5102.639
separate yourself from society wait for

5099.699 --> 5105.5199999999995
a while until Society collapses and then

5102.639 --> 5107.62
watch as they come after you

5105.52 --> 5110.139
because they will because they can

5107.62 --> 5113.639
because that's part of the plan they're

5110.139 --> 5113.639
not going to stop do you understand

5117.34 --> 5121.900000000001
yes that's right governments are

5119.139 --> 5125.4400000000005
attacking like the Nazis

5121.9 --> 5129.0
right you can't negotiate peace

5125.44 --> 5129.0
you can't protest it

5138.4 --> 5143.5599999999995
just keep on saying it and keep on

5140.92 --> 5146.139
saying it I'll be saying it for years

5143.56 --> 5148.96
and everybody will be like oh that Arwen

5146.139 --> 5151.06
if only he didn't say that he would fit

5148.96 --> 5152.5
so much better in the standard narrative

5151.06 --> 5154.84
that they don't understand is

5152.5 --> 5157.54
specifically designed to lead to your

5154.84 --> 5159.76
inevitable Doom

5157.54 --> 5162.88
yeah

5159.76 --> 5165.34
they don't care how peaceful you can be

5162.88 --> 5169.179
they don't care

5165.34 --> 5171.78
they're not going to stop until you end

5169.179 --> 5171.78
them

5178.0 --> 5182.5
right and you don't have to be vexed to

5181.42 --> 5185.76
do it

5182.5 --> 5190.48
I think that as soon as the momentum

5185.76 --> 5192.76
shifts right and then even the vexed you

5190.48 --> 5195.638999999999
know how many of them will have seen

5192.76 --> 5197.02
just the pain that that situation has

5195.639 --> 5199.12
caused themselves and they might even

5197.02 --> 5201.46
know like yeah I'm probably going to die

5199.12 --> 5205.5599999999995
at some point very soon

5201.46 --> 5205.56
let's take vengeance

5205.6 --> 5210.400000000001
right and what do they have to lose

5208.06 --> 5213.580000000001
they're already knowing that they're

5210.4 --> 5216.58
gonna die anyway because of it so guess

5213.58 --> 5220.42
what guess what I'm gonna have some

5216.58 --> 5224.0199999999995
medieval lynching these filthy [ __ ]

5220.42 --> 5224.02
communist Psychopaths

5228.76 --> 5233.139
right

5230.739 --> 5236.08
you don't have to be an anti-vaxxer if

5233.139 --> 5241.08
you don't shut the [ __ ] up sicarious I'm

5236.08 --> 5241.08
gonna ban you you wanker stop whining

5246.04 --> 5251.739
it's not about anti-vaxxers this is

5248.38 --> 5253.62
about [ __ ] Fascism and about the

5251.739 --> 5258.159
freaking vaccine

5253.62 --> 5258.159
not working blatantly

5258.88 --> 5264.96
it doesn't help anyone

5261.4 --> 5264.96
it only makes things worse

5291.699 --> 5295.839999999999
yeah you're a liar get the [ __ ] out

5293.92 --> 5298.0
scumbag

5295.84 --> 5303.88
gum bag

5298.0 --> 5306.42
filthy medical fascist piece of [ __ ] die

5303.88 --> 5306.42
die

5312.3 --> 5316.26
you're out here scumbag

5320.86 --> 5323.339999999999
foreign

5353.92 --> 5359.7390000000005
that's not exactly how that works

5355.96 --> 5361.36
classical homeopath you can't remove the

5359.739 --> 5364.54
consciousness

5361.36 --> 5366.699
but what it can do is severely narrow

5364.54 --> 5370.12
down where you can go with the

5366.699 --> 5372.4
Consciousness basically make you weak

5370.12 --> 5374.92
force you into it

5372.4 --> 5377.08
the near infant state

5374.92 --> 5379.9800000000005
it can't take away the Consciousness

5377.08 --> 5379.98
then you die

5383.5 --> 5389.94
right and that part of it you can

5387.1 --> 5389.9400000000005
restore that

5391.84 --> 5396.659000000001
because it's literally just the

5393.699 --> 5396.659
poisonous influence

5397.42 --> 5402.6990000000005
you can detox that but you can't really

5399.76 --> 5407.04
get the entire thing out of your body

5402.699 --> 5407.04
because of yeah the engineering

5428.86 --> 5434.199
entity

5431.38 --> 5436.659000000001
to replace you well yeah well hey that's

5434.199 --> 5439.659
up to you you know yeah in your weakness

5436.659 --> 5442.36
of course you can attain a Romanian

5439.659 --> 5445.239
spirits and all that yeah

5442.36 --> 5447.4
that is not any different from just a

5445.239 --> 5450.82
regular human being that isn't poison

5447.4 --> 5453.78
like they do that just as well has

5450.82 --> 5453.78
nothing to do with it

5475.54 --> 5478.199
thank you

5479.5 --> 5482.94
what have you missed everything

5503.38 --> 5505.92
hmm

5508.3 --> 5514.96
no he dies of a PCR tests many fails

5511.9 --> 5517.839999999999
what what does that even mean the PCR

5514.96 --> 5521.139
test is not even by the freaking

5517.84 --> 5523.360000000001
designer of them admittedly doesn't even

5521.139 --> 5527.5
work to isolate

5523.36 --> 5529.86
any virus like that they literally said

5527.5 --> 5529.86
that

5530.08 --> 5534.82
what false positives

5532.179 --> 5536.92
what does that even mean

5534.82 --> 5540.219
it's not relevant how many false

5536.92 --> 5543.639
positives the whole thing was incapable

5540.219 --> 5545.7390000000005
of doing what it was being utilized for

5543.639 --> 5547.78
that's a little bit more relevant

5545.739 --> 5551.08
wouldn't you say

5547.78 --> 5555.5199999999995
the amount of false no it was simply

5551.08 --> 5557.8
never usable for what it is being used

5555.52 --> 5559.96
say that has been a bit more of an issue

5557.8 --> 5562.0
wouldn't you say

5559.96 --> 5566.32
oh you sent the tea back song to my

5562.0 --> 5568.8
email okay ilsg I'll check it out later

5566.32 --> 5568.799999999999
though

5604.719 --> 5610.6
right clutch well

5606.94 --> 5614.379999999999
it's just part of the process because

5610.6 --> 5617.02
like yeah the vax is the supposed faxes

5614.38 --> 5618.9400000000005
whatever the v's

5617.02 --> 5622.659000000001
they will become

5618.94 --> 5626.08
worse with every new one

5622.659 --> 5630.219
until they become so poisonous it will

5626.08 --> 5632.8
be like blatantly literally obvious

5630.219 --> 5634.6
that inserting it will literally just

5632.8 --> 5637.719
kill you that that is the only

5634.6 --> 5639.280000000001
inevitable effect that it has it will

5637.719 --> 5642.46
just and it

5639.28 --> 5645.759999999999
they will just go there they will just

5642.46 --> 5648.82
do it and force it it's like oh if you

5645.76 --> 5651.659000000001
don't commit suicide right now you can't

5648.82 --> 5651.659
have this job

5654.1 --> 5658.179
yeah

5656.139 --> 5661.2390000000005
it's not gonna take as long as you would

5658.179 --> 5662.92
imagine that's gonna take before you get

5661.239 --> 5665.5
to that point

5662.92 --> 5669.1
where it's literally going to be

5665.5 --> 5671.98
it's not even claimed anymore to have a

5669.1 --> 5674.9800000000005
medical effect it will probably just be

5671.98 --> 5677.799999999999
outright stated like this is lethal

5674.98 --> 5680.5599999999995
poison this is guaranteed to kill you

5677.8 --> 5682.8
now take it or you're not getting that

5680.56 --> 5682.8
job

5683.679 --> 5691.32
right yeah they're gonna go there it

5687.699 --> 5691.32
will be exactly like that

5691.42 --> 5696.159
so insane so in your face that people

5693.699 --> 5698.32
will just fuse death

5696.159 --> 5700.78
just like that because they don't want

5698.32 --> 5702.699
to be facing a world that works like

5700.78 --> 5706.3
that anymore

5702.699 --> 5709.0
that's what's how it really happens

5706.3 --> 5711.58
the insanity becomes too high then

5709.0 --> 5714.4
people will Tap Out they'll just say I

5711.58 --> 5717.82
don't want to care anymore just just

5714.4 --> 5721.0
kill me I don't care anymore I I don't

5717.82 --> 5723.46
want to be worried about this anymore

5721.0 --> 5726.94
part of what they're doing it's part of

5723.46 --> 5729.159
the deliberate extermination operation

5726.94 --> 5732.839999999999
that they're now performing

5729.159 --> 5732.839999999999
and it's going to get worse

5734.26 --> 5742.54
they will at some point literally

5738.219 --> 5746.199
tell you take this guaranteed lethal

5742.54 --> 5747.58
doses of poison that has no beneficial

5746.199 --> 5751.44
influences

5747.58 --> 5751.44
take it or you won't get the job

5763.679 --> 5767.38
and there will be people that will just

5766.179 --> 5770.52
do it

5767.38 --> 5770.52
and they will die

5770.57 --> 5774.84
[Music]

5772.0 --> 5774.84
it's prescribe

5815.32 --> 5818.46
hey Adam

5819.159 --> 5823.659
foreign

5821.44 --> 5825.759999999999
of course of course they'll blame it on

5823.659 --> 5827.86
the opponent because they are communist

5825.76 --> 5830.679
fascists and that's what they do they

5827.86 --> 5831.94
lit like you gotta realize that their

5830.679 --> 5835.84
tactics

5831.94 --> 5838.0
is to get all unified armored conditions

5835.84 --> 5842.08
they with the group moving on another

5838.0 --> 5844.54
group then metaphorically like in plain

5842.08 --> 5846.78
sight where everybody is present shoot

5844.54 --> 5846.78
them

5847.6 --> 5853.06
like kill like a whole bunch of them and

5850.719 --> 5858.58
then directly after

5853.06 --> 5860.9800000000005
okay so we all know it's their fault

5858.58 --> 5863.86
they are the ones that killed them even

5860.98 --> 5866.98
though we literally just machine gunned

5863.86 --> 5868.179
them to death in front of everybody it's

5866.98 --> 5870.58
their fault

5868.179 --> 5875.8
that's what they do that's what

5870.58 --> 5880.78
communist revolutionary fascists do

5875.8 --> 5883.900000000001
pure mind control pure force of Terror

5880.78 --> 5886.0599999999995
that is like terrorism

5883.9 --> 5888.94
Max

5886.06 --> 5892.6
is Terrorism plus it's just pure

5888.94 --> 5895.419999999999
domination through violence

5892.6 --> 5899.56
that's what they are doing

5895.42 --> 5904.3
it's just not that overt yet

5899.56 --> 5906.280000000001
but it is that you already know like in

5904.3 --> 5908.9800000000005
history last 20 years you will be able

5906.28 --> 5910.84
to just watch back to that watch that

5908.98 --> 5912.699
that situation that one that one that

5910.84 --> 5916.2390000000005
one and you know that what I just

5912.699 --> 5918.719
described is exactly what is happening

5916.239 --> 5922.98
metaphorically

5918.719 --> 5922.9800000000005
esoterically it is what they do

5962.1 --> 5969.42
hey how hey the world how about this

5965.139 --> 5969.42
with your basic research yeah

5969.82 --> 5973.139
it's not a virus

5975.04 --> 5982.84
you can't isolate anything

5978.219 --> 5986.619
the whole model adapted based originally

5982.84 --> 5990.82
on germ Theory and then adapted further

5986.619 --> 5993.5199999999995
into viruses it doesn't work at all

5990.82 --> 5995.44
it is broken

5993.52 --> 5998.56
it is a broken

5995.44 --> 6001.919999999999
no lying oh get the [ __ ] out of here

5998.56 --> 6004.7390000000005
then scumbag it isn't there is no

6001.92 --> 6006.9
isolation there is still no isolation to

6004.739 --> 6009.0599999999995
this day

6006.9 --> 6012.42
yeah

6009.06 --> 6014.820000000001
the whole thing is a fraud it was always

6012.42 --> 6017.82
a fraud

6014.82 --> 6022.5599999999995
The Germ theorists with their

6017.82 --> 6025.08
experiments frauded blatantly

6022.56 --> 6026.6990000000005
on their experiments that was used as

6025.08 --> 6028.44
proof

6026.699 --> 6031.138999999999
they actually

6028.44 --> 6033.659
didn't isolate anything

6031.139 --> 6035.9400000000005
they inject poison with it oh guess what

6033.659 --> 6040.379999999999
they still do to this day yeah because

6035.94 --> 6042.239
it is the poison not the organisms or

6040.38 --> 6044.84
these particles

6042.239 --> 6044.839999999999
see

6047.52 --> 6050.219
show me

6048.9 --> 6054.48
a

6050.219 --> 6058.9800000000005
AV of any sort in which there is no

6054.48 --> 6061.259999999999
poison whatsoever it's only organisms oh

6058.98 --> 6064.199
oh yeah yeah they tell you this story

6061.26 --> 6066.780000000001
now don't they oh they have to insert a

6064.199 --> 6067.919999999999
little poison with it to weaken the

6066.78 --> 6072.48
bacteria

6067.92 --> 6075.4800000000005
oh yeah how convenient that again

6072.48 --> 6077.638999999999
just like the very very first supposed

6075.48 --> 6080.4
experiments

6077.639 --> 6083.36
just had to put a little extra in or

6080.4 --> 6083.36
nothing would happen

6085.139 --> 6089.119
we know I know now

6106.199 --> 6109.94
respiratory infections

6110.159 --> 6114.92
I wouldn't call it an infection it's

6112.139 --> 6114.92
more like a condition

6116.219 --> 6121.32
their conditions and yes

6119.28 --> 6123.78
there are

6121.32 --> 6126.139
inflammations when that happens kind of

6123.78 --> 6126.139
like

6126.36 --> 6132.239
well we have we've just gone to call

6129.36 --> 6133.32
that an infection

6132.239 --> 6137.119
what

6133.32 --> 6138.659
there is no foreign

6137.119 --> 6141.96
elements

6138.659 --> 6145.259999999999
that basically take over the body

6141.96 --> 6147.54
right that that would classify like

6145.26 --> 6150.3
esoterically as an infection it's like

6147.54 --> 6154.32
an outside thing that gets in there

6150.3 --> 6156.719
and then started to replace feed off

6154.32 --> 6159.659
what is already there what was there

6156.719 --> 6162.2390000000005
right well that doesn't happen

6159.659 --> 6164.5199999999995
all the things that come out of

6162.239 --> 6168.419999999999
infections

6164.52 --> 6172.080000000001
right inflammation it's all comes from

6168.42 --> 6174.84
inside the body all these particles were

6172.08 --> 6177.78
a part of the body having been laid

6174.84 --> 6181.26
dormant on purpose until they were

6177.78 --> 6183.42
called forth by the body to help restore

6181.26 --> 6185.88
the body because that's what they really

6183.42 --> 6187.9800000000005
do that's what the bacteria

6185.88 --> 6189.659000000001
and these extra cells these would we

6187.98 --> 6191.879999999999
know as viral that's what they really do

6189.659 --> 6193.739
they're part of the body their body

6191.88 --> 6196.400000000001
inherent they're always there you're

6193.739 --> 6196.4
born with them

6211.98 --> 6215.299999999999
what was the purpose of germ Theory

6213.96 --> 6219.679
throt

6215.3 --> 6219.679
medical control what do you think

6223.5 --> 6229.4
it was immediately utilized in Warfare

6229.739 --> 6233.48
it's all about population control

6248.219 --> 6252.8
yeah ex-gen but it's all nonsense

6256.92 --> 6262.26
why did it happen to a lot of people at

6259.26 --> 6264.06
the same time because people resonate

6262.26 --> 6265.8
with one another it's yeah it's it's

6264.06 --> 6269.9400000000005
normal

6265.8 --> 6273.06
right let's just say people tend to get

6269.94 --> 6276.119
sick in a certain type of season

6273.06 --> 6278.820000000001
then suddenly when that season when the

6276.119 --> 6280.739
effects of it start to hit

6278.82 --> 6283.5
then all of a sudden all these people

6280.739 --> 6286.86
they just all get sick

6283.5 --> 6289.5
because this season has arrived so their

6286.86 --> 6292.32
body responds by becoming sick doing

6289.5 --> 6295.199
that transformation cleaning it up as

6292.32 --> 6297.96
they do in that season right that

6295.199 --> 6302.159
doesn't mean oh it's just happens to be

6297.96 --> 6304.92
that right now for some reason a virus

6302.159 --> 6307.259999999999
or ooh it's spooky spooky and now

6304.92 --> 6309.36
suddenly everybody's infected no that's

6307.26 --> 6311.820000000001
total horseshit

6309.36 --> 6314.82
it was always already in your body

6311.82 --> 6318.54
everything

6314.82 --> 6321.48
it's just the moment it gets triggered

6318.54 --> 6324.48
and yeah when people get triggered to

6321.48 --> 6325.919999999999
start doing that to clean up through

6324.48 --> 6328.199
that disease

6325.92 --> 6329.9400000000005
it's very likely that whatever triggered

6328.199 --> 6332.159
them is triggering a whole bunch of

6329.94 --> 6335.339999999999
people right that can even be like

6332.159 --> 6336.599999999999
post trauma

6335.34 --> 6339.360000000001
like

6336.6 --> 6341.6990000000005
there was like for example like war

6339.36 --> 6343.98
between Villages like something really

6341.699 --> 6346.678999999999
intense and people get killed and it's

6343.98 --> 6349.5
like very tense and nobody's happy about

6346.679 --> 6351.54
it then suddenly there comes peace right

6349.5 --> 6353.699
like they finally got through it and

6351.54 --> 6355.08
they're just gonna stop it guess what's

6353.699 --> 6357.178999999999
going to happen

6355.08 --> 6359.5199999999995
after that piece

6357.179 --> 6362.1
people are gonna certainly sink back and

6359.52 --> 6364.5
guess what they're gonna get sick

6362.1 --> 6366.719
they're gonna get sick because the

6364.5 --> 6369.42
trauma has ended and now the body can

6366.719 --> 6370.9800000000005
actually start to process it and then

6369.42 --> 6375.2390000000005
you get sick and certainly everybody

6370.98 --> 6378.9
gets sick that's normal it's a trauma

6375.239 --> 6383.718999999999
response effect and it typically happens

6378.9 --> 6383.719
to a lot of people at the same time

6394.08 --> 6399.36
attack these bullies with love or

6396.239 --> 6401.94
bullets well it depends if it's just a

6399.36 --> 6405.119
blabbering individual you know

6401.94 --> 6405.69
or like a group of kids that is like I'm

6405.119 --> 6406.92
dominant

6405.69 --> 6409.32
[Music]

6406.92 --> 6411.6
yeah attack them as love if they're

6409.32 --> 6415.259999999999
freaking organized

6411.6 --> 6419.179
paid for militants yeah

6415.26 --> 6419.179
there's no use attacking that with love

6420.719 --> 6424.56
unless you do it like outside of their

6422.94 --> 6429.138999999999
duty hours

6424.56 --> 6429.139
then it might help but still not likely

6443.4 --> 6445.58
foreign

6471.8 --> 6478.139
I'm gonna run out to show

6474.96 --> 6481.08
PA I did manage to get the whole

6478.139 --> 6482.28
two hours full

6481.08 --> 6484.5
right

6482.28 --> 6487.199
but I really do need a break now so
