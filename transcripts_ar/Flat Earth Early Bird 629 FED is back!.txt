333.919 --> 338.56
in the night it even like pretty

336.16 --> 340.88000000000005
lightning stormed

338.56 --> 342.24
so there is a lot of moist in the air

340.88 --> 344.79
although it's already

342.24 --> 346.96000000000004
evaporating a lot of it

344.79 --> 353.84000000000003

[Music]

393.199 --> 399.28000000000003

401.36 --> 405.91900000000004
it is refreshing but

403.199 --> 409.84000000000003
i don't know i don't like the taste of

405.919 --> 409.84
it super much but

415.12 --> 417.68
it's okay

421.599 --> 426.15999999999997

563.6 --> 570.08

566.88 --> 573.8389999999999
again it's really useful when it's this

570.08 --> 573.839
hard to make notes because i'm just

574.839 --> 581.2790000000001
ah

577.519 --> 581.279
my memory is easily gone

582.33 --> 586.64
[Music]

583.519 --> 589.839
right so yesterday

586.64 --> 593.76
didn't really watch it back uh

589.839 --> 595.2790000000001
yeah i watched some alex jones and i

593.76 --> 598.08
watched some om benjamin

595.279 --> 599.12
was live again that was very good oh

598.08 --> 603.12
yeah god

599.12 --> 608.0
yeah i watched a lot of videos yesterday

603.12 --> 610.9590000000001
like a lot of movies and [ __ ] so

608.0 --> 612.959
i got myself to continue watching the

610.959 --> 616.399
beverly hills ninia

612.959 --> 618.079
movie because

616.399 --> 620.72
i don't think i've ever watched it

618.079 --> 623.4399999999999
beyond a certain couple of scenes

620.72 --> 625.2
and i just pushed myself because other

623.44 --> 627.44
people apparently thought it was funny

625.2 --> 629.839
and i was always pissed off

627.44 --> 631.2790000000001
but yeah i did finish it and then i had

629.839 --> 634.32
to conclude like

631.279 --> 637.519
okay okay there were some

634.32 --> 640.0790000000001
like remarkably

637.519 --> 642.5600000000001
spit water out type of laughing

640.079 --> 645.92
situations but also a lot that were just

642.56 --> 647.3599999999999
so freaking annoying but that movie is

645.92 --> 650.3199999999999
crazy

647.36 --> 650.32
anyway uh

650.64 --> 656.959
right yeah checked out a

653.76 --> 660.48
potential new series superheroes with

656.959 --> 662.8
time travel dc legends

660.48 --> 663.839
uh got yeah i don't know it's very

662.8 --> 665.5999999999999
flashy i got

663.839 --> 667.2790000000001
through one episode and then thought

665.6 --> 671.76
like okay

667.279 --> 675.8389999999999
okay that might be interesting we'll see

671.76 --> 675.8389999999999
now that's

675.92 --> 684.24
not good that's not what this is about

680.24 --> 688.0
uh right also watched

684.24 --> 691.76
i had to download it the mandalorian

688.0 --> 695.12
and i find it

691.76 --> 697.92
surprisingly compelling

695.12 --> 699.279
it's it's funny because it is a lot of

697.92 --> 702.16
silence

699.279 --> 706.16
there's a lot of silent scenes in there

702.16 --> 706.16
and i like it's very atmospheric

706.32 --> 712.88
and yeah yoda baby

710.32 --> 717.2
i totally get it the freaking yoda baby

712.88 --> 719.8389999999999
is like holy [ __ ]

717.2 --> 721.0400000000001
that's a fa yeah it's a fascinating

719.839 --> 725.6
series

721.04 --> 725.5999999999999
i'm i'm always almost half through it

728.32 --> 732.9590000000001
very short series every time though

731.519 --> 736.639
there's a lot of

732.959 --> 738.2399999999999
intro outro filler and so it's like 20

736.639 --> 741.36
minutes

738.24 --> 743.279
per episode really really short it's

741.36 --> 744.0790000000001
like a series of shorts but it's good

743.279 --> 747.279
it's really

744.079 --> 749.519
interesting also yeah the mask

747.279 --> 750.959
placement is blatantly obvious i think i

749.519 --> 752.9590000000001
heard i remember other people

750.959 --> 756.16
referencing that as well

752.959 --> 759.1999999999999
the whole mandalorian is you can never

756.16 --> 762.079
take off your masks

759.2 --> 763.44
yeah yeah that's that's blatantly

762.079 --> 766.88
obvious

763.44 --> 767.839
but at the same time i thought the

766.88 --> 769.92
mandalorians

767.839 --> 770.8800000000001
were really interesting and actually

769.92 --> 774.7199999999999
kind of compelling

770.88 --> 776.24
and still yeah it is kind of like a cult

774.72 --> 779.44
but it's like a

776.24 --> 781.279
it's like a a combat cult type

779.44 --> 782.9590000000001
it's it's a religion basically that's

781.279 --> 785.76
what they say

782.959 --> 786.079
and i do find it very fascinating it's

785.76 --> 788.56
like

786.079 --> 788.56
something

789.6 --> 796.0790000000001
yeah i guess it is

793.12 --> 796.5600000000001
i guess an expansion season two seen it

796.079 --> 798.7199999999999
yet

796.56 --> 801.76
no i don't even have a download i didn't

798.72 --> 805.2
know there was a second season yet

801.76 --> 805.2
so no spoilers thanks

809.839 --> 816.9590000000001
but i wonder like how much of this

813.36 --> 818.88
was part of the original conceptions of

816.959 --> 822.2399999999999
star wars or is this something that has

818.88 --> 825.279
been created in the background

822.24 --> 827.04
for a long time like bobo fed boba fett

825.279 --> 830.639
was considered a very cool

827.04 --> 830.639
character and mysterious

830.72 --> 837.0400000000001
and they made like this

834.0 --> 837.04
religion out of it

837.92 --> 842.079
like they retroactively just decided

840.639 --> 846.5600000000001
like yeah that's part of a

842.079 --> 849.92
religion like masked warriors with

846.56 --> 851.5999999999999
special code and yeah

849.92 --> 853.5999999999999
they've priced their armor and they're

851.6 --> 856.0
very alert and yeah

853.6 --> 858.9590000000001
but yeah i don't know i find it kind of

856.0 --> 858.959
interesting really

859.6 --> 863.44
so yeah we'll see where that goes it

861.519 --> 866.399
might get a bit messy

863.44 --> 867.6
but i think that the the setting is very

866.399 --> 872.88
appealing i thought

867.6 --> 872.88
i thought that the the old man alien

873.199 --> 879.68
always finishes up with i'm

876.32 --> 881.0400000000001
i i have spoken i think he's a really

879.68 --> 882.88
cool character

881.04 --> 886.7199999999999
and i think that a lot of the characters

882.88 --> 888.8
in there and even the creatures

886.72 --> 891.6800000000001
it's like it's not so rushed because

888.8 --> 896.8
it's like a lot of scenery and it's just

891.68 --> 899.279
peaceful like everything gets their own

896.8 --> 900.4799999999999
natural instincts and natural presence

899.279 --> 902.48
and it's

900.48 --> 904.9590000000001
it's kind of yeah i like that they

902.48 --> 908.639
worked a lot on the very subtle details

904.959 --> 911.199
and i appreciate that so yeah unexpected

908.639 --> 914.16
i i liked it more than i thought i would

911.199 --> 916.24
definitely gonna continue watching that

914.16 --> 918.399
season two wonder what that's gonna be

916.24 --> 920.639
like

918.399 --> 922.72
but yeah i totally get it i totally get

920.639 --> 924.9590000000001
it why people completely went nuts over

922.72 --> 924.9590000000001
this

925.36 --> 930.5600000000001
with yoda babies and all that yeah

927.76 --> 930.56
totally get it

936.72 --> 940.0790000000001
yeah man and the freaking

951.04 --> 955.36
yeah they really put them down in this

952.839 --> 959.12
series

955.36 --> 959.12
but it is like the tatooine

966.399 --> 970.639
it is the tatooine biosphere like i've

969.759 --> 974.0790000000001
noticed

970.639 --> 977.199
more and more that a lot of star wars

974.079 --> 979.4399999999999
is really centered around the the

977.199 --> 983.4399999999999
creatures

979.44 --> 987.44
and the beings concerning tatooine

983.44 --> 990.9590000000001
like they worked the most on fauna

987.44 --> 994.8000000000001
for yeah for that planet and that

990.959 --> 996.88
and that again shows in this series and

994.8 --> 999.199
i think it it's tatooine

996.88 --> 1001.4399999999999
it should be tatooine or it's a planet

999.199 --> 1003.5999999999999
very much like tattooing i don't know

1001.44 --> 1005.6800000000001
don't even remem remember if they

1003.6 --> 1008.9590000000001
mentioned the name of the planet

1005.68 --> 1011.8389999999999
but whatever planets you know

1008.959 --> 1011.8389999999999
it's a story

1014.88 --> 1018.0
what's wrong with the sound

1023.44 --> 1028.48
i'm talking without my lips moving now

1025.52 --> 1028.48
that's just because

1029.839 --> 1039.839
yeah i don't need to i don't need to

1034.16 --> 1039.8390000000002
yeah i just talk like this

1041.039 --> 1047.28
most of my speech details comes

1044.959 --> 1050.799
from what my tongue is doing i don't

1047.28 --> 1050.799
need to move my lips as much

1050.88 --> 1053.8400000000001
so

1061.44 --> 1068.0800000000002
all right nice yeah yeah my sound

1065.039 --> 1071.039
is registering good

1068.08 --> 1071.039
on obs

1072.799 --> 1076.96
anyway yeah that was what i was doing

1075.12 --> 1080.9599999999998

1114.799 --> 1119.2
but yeah my my old short pants that i

1118.0 --> 1122.0
kind of found

1119.2 --> 1123.3600000000001
uh well it's literally just tearing

1122.0 --> 1125.44
apart

1123.36 --> 1127.4399999999998
like the fabric is too old i think i

1125.44 --> 1128.72
think that that thing is like 20 years

1127.44 --> 1132.72
old or something

1128.72 --> 1134.559
and i was probably never meant to be

1132.72 --> 1136.48
constantly worn like this i've tried to

1134.559 --> 1137.28
find some new ones but they only had

1136.48 --> 1141.039
like

1137.28 --> 1144.799
super oversized fat shorts

1141.039 --> 1149.36
or way too tight

1144.799 --> 1151.6
like half shorts it's so annoying so

1149.36 --> 1153.84
yeah i tried to just buy it at the store

1151.6 --> 1156.799
because

1153.84 --> 1158.559
yeah buying 30 internet you know i have

1156.799 --> 1160.4
no idea how to even

1158.559 --> 1161.9189999999999
do that with the sizes and all that i

1160.4 --> 1165.6000000000001
don't know how women do that

1161.919 --> 1168.0800000000002
i guess would just try and error but

1165.6 --> 1170.0
and and some other men probably but i've

1168.08 --> 1171.9189999999999
always like it's very important to me

1170.0 --> 1175.2
that i can actually try it out

1171.919 --> 1178.5590000000002
what it feels like so

1175.2 --> 1182.0
maybe i should at some point go back

1178.559 --> 1185.28
to uh to the black market

1182.0 --> 1189.12
at beaverweight they have like

1185.28 --> 1190.0
huge retails lots of things you can try

1189.12 --> 1191.84
there and you can find

1190.0 --> 1193.36
everything that's where i get my my

1191.84 --> 1195.28
jackets and

1193.36 --> 1197.84
if i'm lucky i can find good boots there

1195.28 --> 1200.6399999999999
too and all kinds of stuff

1197.84 --> 1203.36
but yeah to do that i really have to

1200.64 --> 1208.64
have some money surplus

1203.36 --> 1208.6399999999999
don't i don't have it right now

1210.24 --> 1213.44
if you have some old trousers you can

1211.76 --> 1216.559
cut them yeah why no

1213.44 --> 1220.159
i don't but

1216.559 --> 1223.84
i bought these half shorts

1220.159 --> 1225.7600000000002
it wasn't that expensive so and

1223.84 --> 1228.0
but they're like in this heat they're

1225.76 --> 1229.84
like too long you know i think that

1228.0 --> 1232.84
for mild weather it would probably be

1229.84 --> 1235.84
fine but i'm gonna go with them to the

1232.84 --> 1235.84
uh

1236.159 --> 1241.6000000000001
clothes repair store and all that and

1239.44 --> 1243.6000000000001
just ask them to shorten it up

1241.6 --> 1246.24
and then probably it's going to be fine

1243.6 --> 1249.12
and at least it's not tearing apart so

1246.24 --> 1250.24
yeah that that was a priority because

1249.12 --> 1253.6
that looks completely

1250.24 --> 1255.28
insane if you have a huge ripped apart

1253.6 --> 1263.84
part of pants

1255.28 --> 1263.84
this is

1267.44 --> 1273.1200000000001
yeah but i don't have to have too many

1269.2 --> 1273.1200000000001
pants laying around to cut down like

1274.84 --> 1277.84
that

1282.48 --> 1291.84
who's this guy in chat

1295.84 --> 1304.48
hey kai from gore

1300.08 --> 1306.24
right what what do you mean how do you

1304.48 --> 1309.039
get from a to b

1306.24 --> 1310.64
oh hey thanks sean tibbetts for the

1309.039 --> 1313.28
three pound super chat donation thank

1310.64 --> 1313.2800000000002
you very much

1313.76 --> 1319.84
with a thumbs up pair

1317.28 --> 1319.84
that's cool

1323.76 --> 1332.48
charity shops right

1327.28 --> 1334.8799999999999
yes stallion 8012 you got a point

1332.48 --> 1336.64
but in this case it's it was really just

1334.88 --> 1340.159
survival buying

1336.64 --> 1343.6000000000001
because it's so freaking hot

1340.159 --> 1345.44
i just had to get something at least

1343.6 --> 1346.6399999999999
something that's not literally tearing

1345.44 --> 1349.3600000000001
apart but

1346.64 --> 1350.24
like to really go out there and go and

1349.36 --> 1352.08
find

1350.24 --> 1353.84
the right pants that's gonna be a

1352.08 --> 1355.76
project for me

1353.84 --> 1356.8799999999999
that i don't look forward to yeah

1355.76 --> 1359.36
without a

1356.88 --> 1360.0
female basically to guide because

1359.36 --> 1363.76
they're always

1360.0 --> 1363.76
so much better at finding that [ __ ]

1364.559 --> 1368.8799999999999
i get all like uh flustered like even

1367.52 --> 1370.559
when it's not that hot

1368.88 --> 1372.8400000000001
but when it's hot it's just extra

1370.559 --> 1375.84
difficult

1372.84 --> 1375.84
uh

1384.72 --> 1388.799
but i know it like secondhand stores yet

1386.88 --> 1391.2
they do have stuff

1388.799 --> 1391.2
you know

1393.919 --> 1399.2
but yeah as a default those stores

1396.799 --> 1402.8799999999999
because i do think i know a couple

1399.2 --> 1406.64
they're like a lot further away

1402.88 --> 1406.64
than where i got these yeah

1407.12 --> 1417.84
these half shorts

1426.32 --> 1432.0
oh that's that's nice if you have a

1428.72 --> 1435.1200000000001
sewing machine eyes wide shut

1432.0 --> 1437.44
look i do use i do my own

1435.12 --> 1438.32
basic repairs with needle and thread and

1437.44 --> 1440.88
stuff i've

1438.32 --> 1442.08
learned that very early it's a very

1440.88 --> 1444.24
handy skill

1442.08 --> 1445.84
and who knows i might be able to utilize

1444.24 --> 1450.08
it on myself

1445.84 --> 1450.08
if really necessary you know what i mean

1450.24 --> 1454.88
because at least i i sort of know how it

1453.2 --> 1458.4
wouldn't work

1454.88 --> 1459.919
uh but

1458.4 --> 1462.0800000000002
that that's a creepy idea by the way i

1459.919 --> 1464.4
don't know how i got to that but

1462.08 --> 1466.559
yeah sewing machines they always confuse

1464.4 --> 1466.5590000000002
me

1468.0 --> 1473.84
my ex was kind of good with that as well

1469.84 --> 1473.84
but i just don't get it

1480.4 --> 1484.0800000000002
then again i guess that if i just had a

1483.12 --> 1487.1999999999998
sewing machine

1484.08 --> 1489.1999999999998
and time on my hands and i

1487.2 --> 1492.0
through screwing around i'd probably

1489.2 --> 1492.0
figure it out

1493.44 --> 1501.8400000000001
but yeah i don't i don't have one

1502.32 --> 1506.6399999999999
anyway yeah how are you guys all doing

1506.0 --> 1509.52
how are you

1506.64 --> 1509.8400000000001
surviving the heat because i think that

1509.52 --> 1512.8799999999999
it's

1509.84 --> 1514.26
it's pretty much hot everywhere in the

1512.88 --> 1517.3590000000002
north of the equator

1514.26 --> 1517.359
[Music]

1520.64 --> 1527.039
man i had some heavy heavy dreaming

1523.84 --> 1529.12
last night i guess also because it did

1527.039 --> 1531.12
cool

1529.12 --> 1533.4399999999998
and it took a cold shower before going

1531.12 --> 1533.4399999999998
to bed

1534.159 --> 1538.48
and yeah and then it had already kind of

1536.799 --> 1541.52
cooled off that helped a lot and i

1538.48 --> 1545.3600000000001
took my my

1541.52 --> 1550.24
sea package with the fish oil and the

1545.36 --> 1553.4399999999998
spirulina and the algia thingy

1550.24 --> 1554.64
and i took it like yeah at night and

1553.44 --> 1559.2
holy [ __ ]

1554.64 --> 1562.3200000000002
did i dream the thing was though that

1559.2 --> 1566.0800000000002
i'm not supposed to remember it and i

1562.32 --> 1568.32
i know that it's weird it's like it was

1566.08 --> 1570.1589999999999
super intense with a lot of strong

1568.32 --> 1574.1589999999999
visuals everywhere

1570.159 --> 1577.919
but it was basically like a sub

1574.159 --> 1580.72
construction of what is happening

1577.919 --> 1583.5200000000002
right now it it's like i was

1580.72 --> 1583.52
pre-building

1583.76 --> 1588.48
yeah in the other dimension it's really

1586.32 --> 1591.84
what it's like it was just

1588.48 --> 1593.039
constructing virtually the things that i

1591.84 --> 1596.48
typically do

1593.039 --> 1599.76
what i pay attention to

1596.48 --> 1602.159
you people how you respond like from

1599.76 --> 1603.919
my perspective so it's not like you're

1602.159 --> 1608.159
completely simulated in there

1603.919 --> 1612.0
i don't even know how most of you look

1608.159 --> 1615.5200000000002
but like things like essence of people

1612.0 --> 1618.24
express itself visually and all that

1615.52 --> 1620.6399999999999
it's fascinating

1618.24 --> 1621.919
so yeah i had like pretty intense

1620.64 --> 1627.8400000000001
dreaming

1621.919 --> 1627.8400000000001
and it was good and yeah

1628.88 --> 1634.4
what is that purple rocks are thrift

1638.84 --> 1641.84
one

1645.84 --> 1649.84
yeah thunderstorms in south england

1650.799 --> 1657.52
yeah we had thunderstorms here as well

1654.0 --> 1660.24
pretty intense one i almost wish that i

1657.52 --> 1662.559
had gotten like the p900 but it was too

1660.24 --> 1662.559
hot

1663.2 --> 1667.2
because yeah there were some pretty

1665.279 --> 1671.12
incredible lightning

1667.2 --> 1675.039
sites that were

1671.12 --> 1678.399
huge they had to have been huge

1675.039 --> 1681.6
because it was like very

1678.399 --> 1685.12
a lot of vertical angle taking up

1681.6 --> 1688.559
yet when it struck it took a long

1685.12 --> 1690.4799999999998
long time before i could hear it

1688.559 --> 1691.76
so it was far away that means that it

1690.48 --> 1695.919
must have been

1691.76 --> 1697.44
just massive massive lightning strike

1695.919 --> 1700.3990000000001
very high

1697.44 --> 1700.3990000000001
from very high up

1701.44 --> 1705.279
because it took a long time before the

1703.279 --> 1707.12
the thunder rolled in

1705.279 --> 1709.039
you know usually when i see something

1707.12 --> 1712.7199999999998
that big it's like

1709.039 --> 1713.36
within half a second the thunder rolls

1712.72 --> 1714.96
in

1713.36 --> 1717.36
because that's normal that it's very

1714.96 --> 1719.1200000000001
bright and big angular wise

1717.36 --> 1721.52
but this time it's like whoa there's

1719.12 --> 1722.7199999999998
some really serious lightning going on

1721.52 --> 1725.9189999999999
over there

1722.72 --> 1727.44
but never above me i don't it it

1725.919 --> 1729.279
just like the last time it kind of

1727.44 --> 1731.919
stayed south of me

1729.279 --> 1731.919
don't get it

1733.679 --> 1739.8400000000001
but we did get rain anyway

1754.48 --> 1767.84
my books what

1769.84 --> 1772.9499999999998
[Music]

1775.76 --> 1781.84
video game hunting oh dear

1787.039 --> 1791.039

1798.0 --> 1809.84
i didn't know about that

1820.84 --> 1837.52

stop stop making it dirty

1837.52 --> 1839.9189999999999

1862.84 --> 1865.84
home

1878.799 --> 1893.84

1901.519 --> 1909.6
agm that's not what

1904.799 --> 1909.6

arween shirtless without

1934.08 --> 1938.72
yeah getting score tendencies then you

1936.64 --> 1940.5590000000002
might have a problem

1938.72 --> 1941.84
because that's not what i would do

1940.559 --> 1943.279
that's not what i'm doing this for i'm

1941.84 --> 1945.6
doing this because i'm just

1943.279 --> 1949.36
freaking hot okay it's not like i think

1945.6 --> 1951.6
it's funny or something

1949.36 --> 1952.559
i'm not embarrassed because hey i know

1951.6 --> 1955.84
yeah i look

1952.559 --> 1957.519
pretty okay or pretty good depending on

1955.84 --> 1960.399
what your standards are you know i'm

1957.519 --> 1960.3990000000001
kind of used to it

1961.279 --> 1966.799
i'm not as super super slim my as i used

1964.08 --> 1969.84
to be up to 10 years ago

1966.799 --> 1971.76
but i'm still pretty good compared to

1969.84 --> 1974.84
most especially so

1971.76 --> 1977.84
i'm not complaining but can we please

1974.84 --> 1977.84
not

1977.919 --> 1985.76
this is not a dating show or something

1982.24 --> 1985.76
you know there's other sites for that

1987.84 --> 1992.8799999999999
thank you i appreciate that

2000.559 --> 2005.84
right so

2013.76 --> 2019.84
other signs

2030.159 --> 2034.96
a dating show that's just absurd man

2038.799 --> 2046.1589999999999
you do realize that like most what is it

2042.559 --> 2049.679
reality tv dating programs

2046.159 --> 2049.679
that it's all just for show

2050.32 --> 2053.2000000000003
like completely

2055.119 --> 2061.52
there's even been like videos about that

2058.96 --> 2063.28
about people that were really thinking

2061.52 --> 2065.28
like yeah we're gonna get married and

2063.28 --> 2067.9190000000003
then just as soon as the cameras like as

2065.28 --> 2069.9190000000003
soon as the contract was over

2067.919 --> 2070.96
like the the other party would just walk

2069.919 --> 2074.0789999999997
away like yeah

2070.96 --> 2075.679
nice working with you

2074.079 --> 2078.32
and they were like crushed like what

2075.679 --> 2078.32
what the [ __ ]

2081.52 --> 2087.52
right yes scripted reality but sometimes

2084.879 --> 2089.679
one of the parties for them it's like

2087.52 --> 2090.48
almost they don't really tell them it's

2089.679 --> 2092.7200000000003
fake

2090.48 --> 2094.56
so they really fall in love and all that

2092.72 --> 2097.7599999999998
it's it's kind of

2094.56 --> 2101.04
yeah mean like that

2097.76 --> 2103.119
basically just using the natural falling

2101.04 --> 2105.92
in love situations

2103.119 --> 2108.1600000000003
to squeeze money out of it tear-jerking

2105.92 --> 2109.52
situations and then afterwards just like

2108.16 --> 2111.68
dump it

2109.52 --> 2113.44
it's like yeah that's too bad oh you

2111.68 --> 2114.16
thought you thought you were in a

2113.44 --> 2117.92
relationship

2114.16 --> 2120.72
no no it's just a just the reality tv

2117.92 --> 2121.44
yeah that's happening that's how that's

2120.72 --> 2124.7999999999997
happened

2121.44 --> 2126.48
kind of since it it started up that sort

2124.8 --> 2129.52
of thing

2126.48 --> 2131.52
it's very rare that

2129.52 --> 2133.92
like i don't know yet it shouldn't be

2131.52 --> 2134.56
like unique but it's very rare that

2133.92 --> 2136.88
people that

2134.56 --> 2137.599
do go on dating reality shows and all

2136.88 --> 2141.28
that that they

2137.599 --> 2141.28
actually stay together

2142.839 --> 2148.16
anyway

2145.76 --> 2150.0
like all that camera [ __ ] you know all

2148.16 --> 2150.96
the peer pressure from people looking

2150.0 --> 2153.28
with you

2150.96 --> 2155.76
it doesn't really help a relationship

2153.28 --> 2159.8390000000004
develop properly you know

2155.76 --> 2159.8390000000004
so there's that

2162.8 --> 2166.88
yeah and some people just do it for the

2164.56 --> 2166.88
money

2171.119 --> 2174.48
like technically it's it's it's even a

2173.599 --> 2176.2400000000002
basic trick

2174.48 --> 2178.2400000000002
you you could do yeah they do it in

2176.24 --> 2181.52
reality tvs

2178.24 --> 2183.52
shows and programs

2181.52 --> 2185.2
but i guess that in the old days they

2183.52 --> 2187.44
probably did these kind of tricks

2185.2 --> 2190.64
just with street situations too you have

2187.44 --> 2194.4
a like a very handsome hunk

2190.64 --> 2198.0789999999997
or super stunning chick and you just

2194.4 --> 2200.64
yeah you just get them

2198.079 --> 2201.44
like honey pots and just get the people

2200.64 --> 2203.7599999999998
real in

2201.44 --> 2204.56
into the story and maybe contributing or

2203.76 --> 2207.76
whatever

2204.56 --> 2210.24
yeah that's such an old technique but

2207.76 --> 2211.599
yeah they can take it all kinds of

2210.24 --> 2214.0789999999997
lengths

2211.599 --> 2215.8900000000003
anyway yeah amanda young nathan is on

2214.079 --> 2219.719
today

2215.89 --> 2219.719
[Music]

2220.56 --> 2224.88
yeah and and i'll tell you something you

2223.28 --> 2227.8390000000004
know

2224.88 --> 2228.4
i didn't know that reality tv was

2227.839 --> 2231.92
actually

2228.4 --> 2235.28
faked when i first found out like how

2231.92 --> 2239.04
totally faked it was that was like

2235.28 --> 2242.0
a real big shock to me because i felt

2239.04 --> 2242.8
stupid that i had believed it in the

2242.0 --> 2244.8
first place

2242.8 --> 2247.2000000000003
[Music]

2244.8 --> 2248.32
but also that it just means that there

2247.2 --> 2252.3999999999996
is so little

2248.32 --> 2256.0
natural things even out there

2252.4 --> 2259.839
through the television i think that

2256.0 --> 2263.04
youtube and like internet platform

2259.839 --> 2264.0
video platforms have probably showed

2263.04 --> 2267.2799999999997
overall more

2264.0 --> 2271.839
natural behavior than the television has

2267.28 --> 2271.8390000000004
in the last 40 years or so

2272.48 --> 2275.599
and then there's the concern like oh

2274.56 --> 2278.4
[ __ ]

2275.599 --> 2281.599
look at what normal people are actually

2278.4 --> 2281.599
like holy [ __ ]

2282.64 --> 2287.359
that's not a very encouraging thing

2286.079 --> 2290.2400000000002
sometimes

2287.359 --> 2291.2
you know that that is also you got to

2290.24 --> 2293.68
realize that's

2291.2 --> 2295.839
kind of the original idea of television

2293.68 --> 2297.839
programming

2295.839 --> 2300.24
and i think the people kind of knew

2297.839 --> 2300.72
about it up to a certain level is that

2300.24 --> 2304.3999999999996
it was

2300.72 --> 2307.5989999999997
meant like public schooling

2304.4 --> 2308.1600000000003
like a secondary schooling and then they

2307.599 --> 2311.599
let

2308.16 --> 2315.04
uh yeah corporate interest

2311.599 --> 2320.32
in it and advertisement and then

2315.04 --> 2320.32
they kind of like took took control

2321.599 --> 2326.1600000000003
they took control over it so then the

2323.599 --> 2327.28
education function was pretty much just

2326.16 --> 2330.96
shoved to the side

2327.28 --> 2333.6800000000003
in interest in replacing all that

2330.96 --> 2336.56
potential setting example like oh this

2333.68 --> 2340.3199999999997
is natural family behavior this is just

2336.56 --> 2342.0
this is good you know in 50s and [ __ ]

2340.32 --> 2345.04
the old tv yeah

2342.0 --> 2346.88
there was there was much more

2345.04 --> 2348.96
encouraging inspiring and decent

2346.88 --> 2352.88
behavior on television

2348.96 --> 2355.76
and like good deep thinking too moments

2352.88 --> 2358.96
but yeah that all was just shoved aside

2355.76 --> 2362.2400000000002
and now it's all just

2358.96 --> 2365.359
become this so you will want to

2362.24 --> 2367.5989999999997
buy things from us

2365.359 --> 2368.4
that's what it's now all it's it's

2367.599 --> 2370.6400000000003
terrible

2368.4 --> 2372.32
it's nothing educate it's anti-education

2370.64 --> 2374.7999999999997
it literally

2372.32 --> 2376.4
encourages you encourages you to drop

2374.8 --> 2379.04
all responsibility

2376.4 --> 2380.8
drop all sanity and just hand them your

2379.04 --> 2383.839
freaking money

2380.8 --> 2383.8390000000004
that's what it does now

2388.88 --> 2392.32
all right hey julie up happen

2392.48 --> 2400.0
oh i'm gonna try this foot bath

2397.04 --> 2400.0
i love that [ __ ]

2404.83 --> 2407.96
[Music]

2408.839 --> 2411.839
nice

2414.16 --> 2420.96
right but i think that even reality tv

2417.52 --> 2425.359
if television world

2420.96 --> 2427.76
was not so corporatized and politicized

2425.359 --> 2430.64
that reality tv could have been

2427.76 --> 2432.88
potentially a really good

2430.64 --> 2434.64
programming tool to even program

2432.88 --> 2438.8
indecent behavior instead of

2434.64 --> 2441.2799999999997
sickening behavior you know what i mean

2438.8 --> 2443.2000000000003
it could have been it's just that the

2441.28 --> 2444.88
people that actually do all these things

2443.2 --> 2446.3999999999996
they don't have that as a priority

2444.88 --> 2452.0
anymore so it seems they don't care

2446.4 --> 2454.56
about that

2452.0 --> 2456.0
they're afraid they'll be rejected or

2454.56 --> 2459.2799999999997
attacked by

2456.0 --> 2462.319
marxist institutions that try to destroy

2459.28 --> 2467.8390000000004
every institution or group

2462.319 --> 2467.839
that promotes good behavior

2470.4 --> 2475.839
based on using wrong pronouns or

2472.8 --> 2475.8390000000004
whatever [ __ ]

2479.44 --> 2486.319
anyway yeah now we got youtube

2482.88 --> 2487.44
got the internet social media for 20

2486.319 --> 2492.079
years and it's all

2487.44 --> 2494.96
really peaking in in what it can do

2492.079 --> 2497.44
and it's already being squeezed and

2494.96 --> 2500.079
manipulated

2497.44 --> 2502.48
because of politics of course taking

2500.079 --> 2504.48
away some of its original potential

2502.48 --> 2506.64
and the algorithms are all screwed up

2504.48 --> 2510.319
all politicized and whatever

2506.64 --> 2513.2799999999997
prone to local

2510.319 --> 2514.079
social abuse like it made it's made to

2513.28 --> 2518.4
do that it's all

2514.079 --> 2518.4
made for easy power abuse it's crazy

2521.359 --> 2537.44
to just bully the spirit out of everyone

2523.92 --> 2541.04
one way or the other

2537.44 --> 2544.0
but yeah we can still do a lot

2541.04 --> 2546.48
we can still do a lot out here on these

2544.0 --> 2550.56
platforms we can still

2546.48 --> 2554.079
put out our thoughts and our feelings

2550.56 --> 2556.88
and try to relay with others

2554.079 --> 2558.6400000000003
what we think is the right thing and

2556.88 --> 2559.839
what we think would be a mistake and

2558.64 --> 2562.16
just

2559.839 --> 2564.24
saying it all and if like hundreds of

2562.16 --> 2566.16
people that are really smart and paying

2564.24 --> 2569.7599999999998
attention all do that

2566.16 --> 2572.8799999999997
then it almost becomes like a

2569.76 --> 2576.0
an automatic

2572.88 --> 2577.04
spirit of government among the free

2576.0 --> 2580.0
people

2577.04 --> 2581.04
see because if you just give it if you

2580.0 --> 2584.16
just give it all

2581.04 --> 2587.68
honestly it

2584.16 --> 2589.92
will resonate and then the the most pure

2587.68 --> 2592.3999999999996
things the best things will come forward

2589.92 --> 2597.52
will resonate the best

2592.4 --> 2599.44
and that will kind of set the minds

2597.52 --> 2600.72
from the grassroots perspective as it

2599.44 --> 2603.52
were

2600.72 --> 2605.2799999999997
from the true free people people that

2603.52 --> 2609.68
want to be free in the face of

2605.28 --> 2611.92
all the crack the crackdown on freedom

2609.68 --> 2614.16
the new world order the neo-feudal

2611.92 --> 2617.119
system and the corporatized

2614.16 --> 2617.1189999999997
politicized

2618.88 --> 2621.839
world out there

2623.2 --> 2629.4399999999996
but i think it works if just enough

2627.2 --> 2631.1189999999997
very smart people relay their ideas and

2629.44 --> 2634.48
they

2631.119 --> 2637.599
and they don't just don't be

2634.48 --> 2639.2
timid don't be paranoid towards things

2637.599 --> 2641.76
that

2639.2 --> 2643.5989999999997
that you don't like it's not about not

2641.76 --> 2646.7200000000003
liking it it's about

2643.599 --> 2649.76
if it is having

2646.72 --> 2652.319
a long-term damaging result on the

2649.76 --> 2656.88
individual

2652.319 --> 2658.56
right now things like flat earth

2656.88 --> 2661.04
yeah a lot of people out there that are

2658.56 --> 2662.96
smart that are strategic that really

2661.04 --> 2664.72
do in their own way have the world's

2662.96 --> 2666.56
best interest at heart or at least they

2664.72 --> 2669.9199999999996
want things around them stable

2666.56 --> 2673.359
enough and that's good enough but

2669.92 --> 2675.92
still they will be very nervous

2673.359 --> 2677.2799999999997
if even if good information comes from a

2675.92 --> 2680.64
flat earther i know

2677.28 --> 2681.44
i know this i know it they still want to

2680.64 --> 2684.72
listen

2681.44 --> 2687.359
but they're very nervous

2684.72 --> 2688.839
because flat earth is like a no-go zone

2687.359 --> 2692.0789999999997
for their own

2688.839 --> 2695.52
hearts because they feel they have

2692.079 --> 2701.2000000000003
too much to build on the globe

2695.52 --> 2701.2
too many ideas too many visions too many

2702.839 --> 2706.7999999999997
dreams

2704.079 --> 2708.96
a lot of people that do want to build on

2706.8 --> 2710.5600000000004
yeah build a better future for everyone

2708.96 --> 2714.2400000000002
honestly do

2710.56 --> 2714.24
they do have that in their minds

2716.48 --> 2720.16
they're still stuck to the glow but yeah

2719.359 --> 2723.04
i hope that

2720.16 --> 2726.0789999999997
eventually they'll just learn to deal

2723.04 --> 2726.079
with it better and not

2727.28 --> 2733.8390000000004
not respond so allergic to it

2744.839 --> 2750.7999999999997
anyway

2746.88 --> 2753.44
but you guys do get it right the idea

2750.8 --> 2753.44
if people

2755.119 --> 2760.96
like me or maybe others

2759.599 --> 2763.2000000000003
now two more hours is not going to

2760.96 --> 2766.56
happen sorry purple rockstar

2763.2 --> 2766.56
just 15 max

2766.96 --> 2774.8
uh but if everybody just honestly throws

2770.96 --> 2777.44
out good ideas in the hopes that they

2774.8 --> 2781.2000000000003
will be listened to that it will spread

2777.44 --> 2781.2000000000003
will be relayed to others

2782.4 --> 2787.52
now you could almost see it as like a

2784.319 --> 2790.0
giant chart

2787.52 --> 2791.599
of opinions the opinions of like a lot

2790.0 --> 2793.599
of different people

2791.599 --> 2795.44
how much do they attune how much do they

2793.599 --> 2796.1600000000003
resonate how much do they reflect on one

2795.44 --> 2799.359
another

2796.16 --> 2799.7599999999998
how do they prioritize their opinions

2799.359 --> 2803.7599999999998
because

2799.76 --> 2806.48
th this will be revealed over time

2803.76 --> 2806.88
they can say they're like this or like

2806.48 --> 2809.92
that

2806.88 --> 2810.96
or they never do this that but over time

2809.92 --> 2815.04
it always

2810.96 --> 2817.119
reveals how they actually do it

2815.04 --> 2818.56
you can tell if you will remember if you

2817.119 --> 2821.119
don't listen

2818.56 --> 2821.92
to what they say they did but you just

2821.119 --> 2824.4
were there

2821.92 --> 2826.88
you saw it happen and then you figure

2824.4 --> 2826.88
them out

2827.04 --> 2832.56
you really do and i've got some

2830.72 --> 2835.2799999999997
a couple of people like that figured out

2832.56 --> 2839.92
i'm not even gonna name names but

2835.28 --> 2839.92
that's why i pay so much close attention

2840.16 --> 2845.2799999999997
to people that have my interest that

2841.76 --> 2847.28
have good information

2845.28 --> 2849.92
because if they're just blabbering about

2847.28 --> 2852.079
generic nonsense

2849.92 --> 2853.119
and yeah quite a lot of people do that

2852.079 --> 2856.48
unfortunately

2853.119 --> 2858.96
you know it it's everywhere

2856.48 --> 2860.72
then it's just my attention just drops

2858.96 --> 2864.0
it's like that's so generic

2860.72 --> 2866.0789999999997
you know i can literally walk outside

2864.0 --> 2867.76
bump into a random person and start a

2866.079 --> 2869.599
conversation about that

2867.76 --> 2871.6800000000003
that's not something that i'm really

2869.599 --> 2873.3590000000004
interested in doing or i'd be walking

2871.68 --> 2875.359
outside bumping into people talking

2873.359 --> 2878.5589999999997
about it all day

2875.359 --> 2881.7599999999998
you know but no i want

2878.559 --> 2886.559
other things one things that not

2881.76 --> 2888.4
everybody is talking about huh

2886.559 --> 2890.559
i want things that everybody's going to

2888.4 --> 2892.2400000000002
be talking about in a couple of years

2890.559 --> 2895.2000000000003
that's what i do

2892.24 --> 2897.68
that's what i do every freaking time

2895.2 --> 2900.24
it's almost like a curse

2897.68 --> 2902.48
you know everybody was still reifying

2900.24 --> 2906.0
the disc model i was like wait but

2902.48 --> 2907.04
they're not objects they're holographic

2906.0 --> 2908.8
and everybody was ha

2907.04 --> 2910.16
what the [ __ ] are you talking about this

2908.8 --> 2914.96
is some weird peachy

2910.16 --> 2917.839
talk or something no no trust me

2914.96 --> 2918.8
i'm right this is and yeah a couple of

2917.839 --> 2922.0789999999997
years later

2918.8 --> 2925.92
look look at what came afloat

2922.079 --> 2928.2400000000002
you know because

2925.92 --> 2928.96
while everybody was still just in that

2928.24 --> 2931.2799999999997
fight like

2928.96 --> 2932.0
the disc versus the ball the disc versus

2931.28 --> 2934.1600000000003
the ball

2932.0 --> 2935.28
they were all like muscling it was like

2934.16 --> 2938.3999999999996
a

2935.28 --> 2939.8390000000004
a scramble period of scrambling and i

2938.4 --> 2941.28
was like this is just

2939.839 --> 2943.44
what are you doing you think you're

2941.28 --> 2946.4
winning over them but i know they're

2943.44 --> 2946.4
never going to give up

2946.559 --> 2954.079
and you could also be trying to

2950.64 --> 2956.7999999999997
figure it out further what else has been

2954.079 --> 2958.079
eluding you so that's what i then do i

2956.8 --> 2959.8390000000004
always when everybody's still

2958.079 --> 2962.48
preoccupied with the

2959.839 --> 2964.4
struggle of ball versus flat earth i'm

2962.48 --> 2968.72
like oh what is this we just

2964.4 --> 2971.839
zoom in scan four possibilities

2968.72 --> 2972.72
what does have other people not seen and

2971.839 --> 2976.16
then

2972.72 --> 2977.2
if i find something i open it up right

2976.16 --> 2978.72
there

2977.2 --> 2980.319
just like on the flat earth page you

2978.72 --> 2982.0
know this happens people bring up

2980.319 --> 2983.359
charts that i've never seen before i

2982.0 --> 2985.76
take a look and it's like

2983.359 --> 2986.5589999999997
whoa dude what i'm seeing here this and

2985.76 --> 2990.3190000000004
that

2986.559 --> 2993.0400000000004
that that's typically me

2990.319 --> 2995.599
you know that because it happens

2993.04 --> 2995.599
instantly

2996.319 --> 3001.68
like i in that sense i don't have

2999.839 --> 3005.599
control over the speed

3001.68 --> 3009.1189999999997
of my own inside when it happens

3005.599 --> 3011.6800000000003
it just happens everything did

3009.119 --> 3014.319
it's way faster than i can consciously

3011.68 --> 3014.319
do things

3020.0 --> 3023.76
you are describing exactly what

3021.52 --> 3027.44
scientists do yeah well

3023.76 --> 3029.119
in that sense i am a scientist

3027.44 --> 3031.839
although i have not technically

3029.119 --> 3035.6800000000003
performed an experiment just yet

3031.839 --> 3035.68
but i do have hypotheses

3036.4 --> 3040.8
already set up so i have some

3038.48 --> 3042.559
experiments that i at some point would

3040.8 --> 3043.8390000000004
like to do and then maybe i can have a

3042.559 --> 3046.4
certificate

3043.839 --> 3048.4
i'm a scientist and i can have my own

3046.4 --> 3050.0
lab coat

3048.4 --> 3054.559
i already have one but it's like really

3050.0 --> 3056.8
dirty should have a new one

3054.559 --> 3058.1600000000003
but yeah that's the funny thing the

3056.8 --> 3061.28
fuzzler i

3058.16 --> 3063.2799999999997
wanted to be a scientist

3061.28 --> 3064.4
and then i was basically i figured out

3063.28 --> 3066.48
what was going on

3064.4 --> 3068.1600000000003
back then and was basically presented

3066.48 --> 3070.16
with yeah you want to be a real

3068.16 --> 3072.48
scientist that's really nice

3070.16 --> 3073.7599999999998
here's what you can do as a real science

3072.48 --> 3075.599
scientist

3073.76 --> 3077.6800000000003
you can get a lot of pay and then you

3075.599 --> 3079.839
have to pretend to everyone like you're

3077.68 --> 3081.359
really smart use all your intelligence

3079.839 --> 3082.88
to make yourself look as smart as you

3081.359 --> 3084.5589999999997
can

3082.88 --> 3086.319
and just convince him of this this and

3084.559 --> 3089.599
this and this and this

3086.319 --> 3092.64
i was like what the [ __ ] no

3089.599 --> 3096.7200000000003
i want to [ __ ] figure out

3092.64 --> 3100.0
what's going on what is real

3096.72 --> 3101.839
i don't want to be a blabbler

3100.0 --> 3103.52
that's supposed to be all brilliant no

3101.839 --> 3106.0
no no no

3103.52 --> 3108.0
i don't i don't care well i do care but

3106.0 --> 3110.8
i want it to just be

3108.0 --> 3114.4
real and not me pretending all day long

3110.8 --> 3116.1600000000003
like i'm smart let it just be

3114.4 --> 3119.44
i want to figure things out i want to

3116.16 --> 3121.52
actually do the mental exploration

3119.44 --> 3124.319
i'm an explorer i explore the other

3121.52 --> 3127.7599999999998
dimension the spirit dimension which is

3124.319 --> 3129.68
synchronized to your conscious intellect

3127.76 --> 3133.119
and all that

3129.68 --> 3139.5989999999997
so that's what i'm doing what i'm doing

3133.119 --> 3142.4
i'm a plane shifter

3139.599 --> 3144.1600000000003
yeah it's not a shape shifter a plane

3142.4 --> 3147.2000000000003
shifter it adds

3144.16 --> 3152.0
dnd terminology it's more

3147.2 --> 3155.2
yeah planar traveler

3152.0 --> 3157.2
but yeah not i don't literally

3155.2 --> 3159.5989999999997
go there anyway it's just that i used to

3157.2 --> 3163.2
do that for like 80 years

3159.599 --> 3165.04
somewhere 20 years ago and yeah that's

3163.2 --> 3169.52
literally parallel to my

3165.04 --> 3171.359
linear time existence and the memories

3169.52 --> 3173.52
are back so it's like this thing that

3171.359 --> 3176.64
happened retroactively

3173.52 --> 3180.4
like my time linear

3176.64 --> 3184.0
experience every day getting up

3180.4 --> 3187.119
eating all that going to bed videos

3184.0 --> 3190.16
right oh way back in the past

3187.119 --> 3193.28
i had an extreme experience boom

3190.16 --> 3196.7999999999997
and that basically overreached all of it

3193.28 --> 3200.1600000000003
including here

3196.8 --> 3203.76
and beyond but

3200.16 --> 3203.7599999999998
because of the workings of it

3204.4 --> 3211.92
it's like i'm not allowed to literally

3208.079 --> 3215.04
just put it all down and i can't

3211.92 --> 3215.04
because of that i can't

3215.119 --> 3219.04
it's a sort of cassandra complex type

3217.839 --> 3220.88
thing

3219.04 --> 3223.2799999999997
that's the best i can make of it but i

3220.88 --> 3224.8
do remember that i remember so much even

3223.28 --> 3227.2000000000003
things that i'm quite sure about in the

3224.8 --> 3230.7200000000003
future

3227.2 --> 3232.48
and then again there was the idealized

3230.72 --> 3235.04
horror basically of

3232.48 --> 3236.0
of absolute domination by the satanists

3235.04 --> 3239.839
that they also try

3236.0 --> 3240.96
to illusion over me sort of parallel to

3239.839 --> 3245.2799999999997
that so it's very

3240.96 --> 3247.92
confusing there's a lot of like i saw it

3245.28 --> 3249.2000000000003
but there's a lot of like misinformation

3247.92 --> 3253.28
placed

3249.2 --> 3253.2799999999997
in between it by them

3254.079 --> 3265.8390000000004
and yeah it's been quite a puzzle

3281.119 --> 3285.119
someone in the scientific community no

3283.119 --> 3288.2400000000002
of course not

3285.119 --> 3291.52
no a jesuit guy

3288.24 --> 3294.64
you know controller

3291.52 --> 3296.96
because i was basically like this

3294.64 --> 3298.319
is fake i don't want this i want to do

3296.96 --> 3301.839
this and this and this and

3298.319 --> 3303.92
everybody was like yeah that's not on

3301.839 --> 3309.2799999999997
the agenda

3303.92 --> 3309.28
i was like what why not

3318.64 --> 3323.359
but i have talked with well peop even

3321.599 --> 3324.0
when i still was a baller i've talked a

3323.359 --> 3327.52
lot with

3324.0 --> 3329.359
people about that as well you know even

3327.52 --> 3329.7599999999998
the same kind of things that i do bring

3329.359 --> 3333.52
up

3329.76 --> 3336.7990000000004
during the flat earth debates like hey

3333.52 --> 3339.2
why isn't the outer universe gaseous

3336.799 --> 3342.319
why isn't it all filled with a limited

3339.2 --> 3342.319
amount of gas pressure

3342.559 --> 3347.599
but still much much more than just that

3345.68 --> 3350.24
presumed vacuum that would be more

3347.599 --> 3363.839
logical that was an idea i brought then

3350.24 --> 3363.839
25 years ago okay

3365.68 --> 3369.52
what that's so dumb of him to say

3371.359 --> 3376.799
no he just knew what was going on

3374.16 --> 3380.64
because he was fully

3376.799 --> 3385.2
no he was dude he was in the darkness

3380.64 --> 3385.2
like really there and he knew

3386.16 --> 3391.839
he just knew it was all [ __ ] even

3388.319 --> 3391.839
back then

3417.92 --> 3422.799
anyway i'm rounding out the show it's

3420.48 --> 3424.16
almost too bad

3422.799 --> 3426.88
because the temperature is finally

3424.16 --> 3430.319
dropping and i almost feel like

3426.88 --> 3433.359
continuing but i am going to

3430.319 --> 3436.24
join the flan earth debate so let's see

3433.359 --> 3436.24
there's already a link

3438.079 --> 3443.599
yeah yeah there is all right

3441.2 --> 3445.04
well thanks then everyone for coming i

3443.599 --> 3445.28
hope you liked the show i thought it was

3445.04 --> 3447.44
a

3445.28 --> 3449.3590000000004
it was pretty good despite the technical

3447.44 --> 3452.48
difficulties again

3449.359 --> 3454.319
to fix that somehow anyway if you like

3452.48 --> 3456.48
