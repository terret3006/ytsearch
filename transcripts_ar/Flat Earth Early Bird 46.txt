10.82 --> 14.71
good morning

16.59 --> 23.65
this is flatter the earlybird number 46

19.99 --> 28.15
i I'm your host

23.65 --> 29.14
Arwen yeah and it's not exactly what I

28.15 --> 39.25
expected

29.14 --> 42.13
what happened see yep somehow the

39.25 --> 50.53
streaming function of OBS is not routed

42.13 --> 52.78
into the actual hangout odd and

50.53 --> 57.19
apparently my audio also seems to be a

52.78 --> 68.5
bit low this is better

57.19 --> 71.25
probably but let me try out settings

68.5 --> 71.25
really quickly

96.719 --> 109.24
okay it's just great yeah by the way I

106.75 --> 117.57900000000001
for some reason I can't turn on my

109.24 --> 120.03899999999999
camera so it says actually in the Google

117.579 --> 125.49
hangout itself where I'm also present

120.039 --> 125.49
that it is on well obviously it's not

126.569 --> 135.88
you know what let me try something else

130.03 --> 140.769
I'm just gonna present my OBS I'm right

135.88 --> 146.47
there's no secure she it should be

140.769 --> 154.20000000000002
hiding but anyway this was what I was

146.47 --> 159.48
going to show you but yeah even if I

154.2 --> 169.66
yeah I even says I am streaming here but

159.48 --> 172.62
no towards the right thingy probably got

169.66 --> 172.62
something wrong here

175.98 --> 188.85999999999999
so yeah well that was probably bound to

182.53 --> 193.74
happen I should have done a live test

188.86 --> 193.74
before never got to it

213.989 --> 221.4
mm so yeah what do I do now

267.0 --> 269.75
all right

272.37 --> 280.33
yeah sorry guys I am trying to figure

277.719 --> 283.419
out some of the technicalities now that

280.33 --> 287.31899999999996
like in OBS its stop streaming I have

283.419 --> 291.12
more options in settings so I'm looking

287.319 --> 291.12
if there's something I've missed

294.16 --> 297.319
[Music]

303.54 --> 310.11
the key seems to be right and everything

307.28 --> 316.10999999999996
can't really find anything out of the

310.11 --> 323.07
ordinary I don't know why why it didn't

316.11 --> 329.82
just stream through the OBS yeah I know

323.07 --> 337.49
you guys can hear me but you can't see

329.82 --> 337.49
me you can only see my icon so ray

338.65 --> 341.82
[Music]

366.12 --> 372.66
yep well that completely killed the

369.82 --> 372.65999999999997
start of my show

386.51 --> 394.21999999999997
yeah here for now I got the whole scenes

389.96 --> 397.46
and sources completely set up quite

394.22 --> 400.94000000000005
dynamic for a starter that's not the

397.46 --> 404.41999999999996
problem the problem is that when I say

400.94 --> 408.14
in the controls over to the right start

404.42 --> 412.51
streaming nothing happens so what I did

408.14 --> 415.43
instead is just start to broadcast on

412.51 --> 418.15999999999997
the Google Hangouts in the hopes that

415.43 --> 419.75
maybe that would start it it didn't it

418.16 --> 424.52000000000004
just started it from the perspective

419.75 --> 433.97
Google Hangouts says has frozen by the

424.52 --> 447.77
way present this again so at least you

433.97 --> 451.97
could see something see three the live

447.77 --> 453.53
chat but yeah start screaming stop

451.97 --> 456.26000000000005
streaming it doesn't really seem to

453.53 --> 459.71
matter there is output so it's not like

456.26 --> 462.68
there's something broken but it's not

459.71 --> 465.08
being directed forward to Google

462.68 --> 469.69
Hangouts for some reason even though in

465.08 --> 476.51
the settings everything is set

469.69 --> 480.92
accordingly and I think even weirder

476.51 --> 484.36
I haven't tempered with it and on my try

480.92 --> 487.91
out like three months ago or something

484.36 --> 491.05
it did actually work and now it doesn't

487.91 --> 491.05
I don't get it

493.55 --> 496.619
[Music]

500.559 --> 510.069
by the way it is a really beautiful

504.329 --> 512.919
beautiful day here very clear of clouds

510.069 --> 516.839
here and there but when the Sun comes

512.919 --> 520.659
from behind them and really bright

516.839 --> 526.24
winter some very beautiful very

520.659 --> 537.22
refreshing ones wind still so that's

526.24 --> 539.61
also nice not what flat ball that is

537.22 --> 539.61
weird

541.35 --> 547.839
three hours and try again well let's

545.949 --> 555.639
just say if I can't get it to work

547.839 --> 558.72
during this show then I will I will

555.639 --> 562.45
absolutely try again later in the day I

558.72 --> 565.35
don't have anything special to do anyway

562.45 --> 569.759
[Music]

565.35 --> 569.759
so yeah I guess

586.71 --> 596.6
so at least you can see something so

597.32 --> 601.0100000000001
what can I do

609.05 --> 617.1999999999999
would be good if if Adam was here but

613.46 --> 619.85
considering late night stream yesterday

617.2 --> 622.13
which it was a bit of a part of as well

619.85 --> 625.13
although not very active so I wasn't

622.13 --> 647.66
kind of tired he's probably still asleep

625.13 --> 649.4
so hey Randy see you 1:01 rockhound I'm

647.66 --> 655.93
strapping up with you here anymore

649.4 --> 655.93
Daniel field John Watson flat ball

656.62 --> 672.92
sounds memetics Randy then Winfield and

664.0 --> 679.46
believable productions here for now yeah

672.92 --> 684.76
how are you guys doing I hope you like

679.46 --> 684.76
my my fractal screen here

690.17 --> 710.3399999999999
so let's see yeah here's my monologue

703.89 --> 716.22
screen yay still with the chat and yeah

710.34 --> 723.39
all this possible output here good bring

716.22 --> 725.19
in a Skype hello oh yeah the head the

723.39 --> 728.34
Hangout is presenting itself so that's

725.19 --> 730.83
gonna create that loop of course camera

728.34 --> 737.21
feed yes

730.83 --> 737.21
Skype and this is the background picture

737.63 --> 745.38
it's like yeah visualization of the

743.28 --> 748.1999999999999
rectangular looping earth without

745.38 --> 750.78
knowing what is beyond the north and the

748.2 --> 757.1600000000001
south so considering it is looping

750.78 --> 757.16
directly in that sense anyway

762.86 --> 766.52
I'll just put it

823.0 --> 832.3
right here for now well I tried to start

828.189 --> 835.8389999999999
the stream here but yeah nothing

832.3 --> 841.0889999999999
responded like the the Hangout didn't

835.839 --> 845.6990000000001
start up like I tried for him I think

841.089 --> 849.7900000000001
for over a minute nothing happened and

845.699 --> 854.5
then so I decided okay Oh either I could

849.79 --> 856.24
be very very late or I can just start it

854.5 --> 860.31
through here maybe I did something wrong

856.24 --> 863.05
it was basically improvising

860.31 --> 869.29
prioritizing started English starting

863.05 --> 873.3389999999999
the show in time so that have resulted

869.29 --> 876.31
in me now not really being able to fix

873.339 --> 880.6800000000001
the situation properly but there you go

876.31 --> 880.68
that's how it happened

909.43 --> 926.78
hmm

910.97 --> 932.9
oh dear yeah Ellen be the actor yeah

926.78 --> 940.79
apparently you can get quite evil at

932.9 --> 942.8299999999999
times and he can't uphold this gentleman

940.79 --> 946.99
like attitude when that happens

942.83 --> 950.0500000000001
apparently and yeah thus he will

946.99 --> 954.59
completely fall out like a demon

950.05 --> 957.3499999999999
apparently like I've seen that to a

954.59 --> 962.0
certain level happening when he gets

957.35 --> 964.1
like really benign but maybe yeah I did

962.0 --> 967.52
go a lot further I still haven't seen it

964.1 --> 976.0400000000001
I still haven't gotten that example on a

967.52 --> 979.5699999999999
talk what yeah we'll find out i I'd see

976.04 --> 979.5699999999999
him being able to do that

1011.71 --> 1019.089
right okay thanks for the info here for

1015.43 --> 1022.029
now I'm currently just presenting screen

1019.089 --> 1025.569
and hitting basically directly

1022.029 --> 1028.839
presenting the OBS screen so yeah it is

1025.569 --> 1033.25
jumbled and my video is probably gonna

1028.839 --> 1036.9099999999999
be later than my audio because the audio

1033.25 --> 1040.74
has the direct input to the Google

1036.91 --> 1040.74
Hangouts not just OBS

1040.849 --> 1043.9289999999999
[Music]

1052.02 --> 1058.7
I don't know maybe maybe the key changed

1056.27 --> 1061.82
maybe that is it

1058.7 --> 1066.0
maybe the the YouTube my YouTube key

1061.82 --> 1069.299
changed and it still program with the

1066.0 --> 1071.01
old key I should probably check that but

1069.299 --> 1074.6299999999999
yeah you can do that voila

1071.01 --> 1074.6299999999999
well I'm streaming so

1090.65 --> 1102.71
um no some semitic sounds mimetics i'm

1098.15 --> 1108.8000000000002
not gonna show you my computer in my

1102.71 --> 1112.3400000000001
browser and everything and I'm

1108.8 --> 1113.8
definitely not gonna show my my Google

1112.34 --> 1117.85
code

1113.8 --> 1117.85
my stream coating

1122.67 --> 1125.809
[Music]

1128.269 --> 1138.45
okay right so letters early-bird maybe a

1134.19 --> 1142.009
little yeah 46 maybe a little bit messy

1138.45 --> 1146.97
but I'm considering cutting this

1142.009 --> 1149.429
specific hangout short and then trying

1146.97 --> 1154.799
to see if I can very quickly get that

1149.429 --> 1158.0900000000001
code right and then start streaming from

1154.799 --> 1161.37
the OBS platform see if that works and

1158.09 --> 1163.289
if it doesn't work then yeah I guess

1161.37 --> 1166.11
that the rest of the Flat Earth

1163.289 --> 1171.24
early-bird show may be canceled for

1166.11 --> 1179.33
today and I will figure it out and just

1171.24 --> 1179.33
start properly again tomorrow so

1194.51 --> 1197.3799999999999
all right

1208.29 --> 1214.74
yeah anyway just give them their more

1213.99 --> 1218.45
content

1214.74 --> 1222.0
yeah be hangout yesterday evening night

1218.45 --> 1227.75
was funny was out of nowhere and was

1222.0 --> 1232.59
kind of interesting and funny and

1227.75 --> 1235.65
surprisingly flat earth debate ish I

1232.59 --> 1240.6599999999999
guess that's what you get when you put

1235.65 --> 1244.02
these guys together it just starts to

1240.66 --> 1249.74
happen automatically they yeah they

1244.02 --> 1249.74
really felt like it and I was amusing

1253.52 --> 1269.48
but yeah after that I got pretty tired

1257.25 --> 1274.38
so City watching Netflix again so yeah I

1269.48 --> 1277.3700000000001
think I will round out this potentially

1274.38 --> 1283.3700000000001
first part maybe only part of the

1277.37 --> 1286.4399999999998
flattered early-bird 46 show and

1283.37 --> 1290.79
whatever happens I will at least be on

1286.44 --> 1296.3700000000001
the flat earth debates in 40 minutes

1290.79 --> 1302.01
roughly from now and maybe in my attempt

1296.37 --> 1305.4299999999998
to yet to start up through OBS will

1302.01 --> 1309.36
succeed within half win if within the

1305.43 --> 1312.45
half hour and then I will see you on the

1309.36 --> 1313.9799999999998
second half so in the meantime if you're

1312.45 --> 1318.78
seeing this please don't forget to

1313.98 --> 1322.17
subscribe to my channel and uploaded the

1318.78 --> 1324.87
video if you like this obvious format

1322.17 --> 1329.0700000000002
thingy that I made that I will try to

1324.87 --> 1331.59
stream from from now on maybe update a

1329.07 --> 1335.76
little bit more on the road and try to

1331.59 --> 1340.04
get that intro right and well until the

1335.76 --> 1340.04
next video keep it
