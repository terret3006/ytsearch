Sunny that's looking

168.0 --> 173.44
nice temperature seems to be gradually

170.92 --> 173.44
shifting

175.64 --> 182.67999999999998
upward all

178.599 --> 183.79899999999998
right same St Patrick's Day is it St

huh yeah it

198.319 --> 205.92
is all

200.08 --> 208.76000000000002
[Music]

205.92 --> 211.76
right

208.76 --> 211.76
h

224.68 --> 229.36
so I guess in some places they're

226.28 --> 229.36
painting the town

238.72 --> 241.72
green

246.239 --> 249.079
H

249.159 --> 254.67999999999998
yeah I had a great sleep this

257.919 --> 264.96
night I woke up like all euphoric and

261.56 --> 264.96
everything was absolutely

267.96 --> 276.19899999999996
fantastic the roof of C H is get sleep

273.0 --> 276.199

ahead day for drinking yeah not for

285.44 --> 289.039
me good luck with

297.18 --> 301.639
[Music]

298.639 --> 301.639
that

309.24 --> 316.039
right so yeah I thought that the time

312.32 --> 320.0
would have switched

316.039 --> 320.0
already but apparently it

320.16 --> 323.68
hasn't just kind of

327.12 --> 334.899
weird leprechaun are a no Oscar

331.8 --> 334.899
[Music]

336.08 --> 340.44
octopus don't know if there exactly

355.319 --> 360.199
Ace all right anyway yeah normally i'

358.12 --> 364.16
start 2 p.m.

360.199 --> 366.319
Amsterdam time but tried to start 1 p.m.

364.16 --> 370.68
Amsterdam time but yeah I

366.319 --> 371.84000000000003
was I had a late night had a great call

370.68 --> 375.479
my friend

371.84 --> 378.67999999999995
in like really great but it did last

375.479 --> 378.68
like pretty long into the

378.8 --> 384.8
night did a whole bunch of healing and

386.639 --> 391.56
stuff are they an Irish elf

395.88 --> 400.88
uh I think you could think of them as

398.36 --> 400.88
that

418.52 --> 421.52
sure

426.52 --> 428.87899999999996
all right

431.24 --> 436.319
anyway my dreams were all full of energy

434.12 --> 439.12
and and like I'm still like kind of

436.319 --> 439.12
waking up from

440.68 --> 445.44
it I almost like just wanted to stay in

443.36 --> 448.52000000000004
bed because it just felt so great I woke

445.44 --> 451.52
up just great is quite a contrast with

448.52 --> 451.52
the last week

469.36 --> 472.759
basically haven't really figured out

471.4 --> 475.19899999999996
what to talk

472.759 --> 477.72
about

475.199 --> 480.199
yet and yeah I don't really know a lot

477.72 --> 483.199
about St Patrick's Day

480.199 --> 483.199
never really been my

484.97 --> 492.149
[Music]

493.199 --> 501.36
thing did watch like the M unveiled

498.72 --> 503.59900000000005
video that was posted like a week ago I

501.36 --> 506.639
completely missed it at the time China

503.599 --> 511.0
unveiled the first part really

506.639 --> 514.24
interesting it is like a the history

511.0 --> 516.479
dive into what seems to be tartaria like

514.24 --> 521.88
in a very accurate

516.479 --> 523.9190000000001
setup and how there were Chinese in west

521.88 --> 525.48
of the United States in California

523.919 --> 527.56
specifically and how it's been kind of

525.48 --> 530.64
convoluted and there was even like a

527.56 --> 534.3199999999999
Mini World War

530.64 --> 538.4399999999999
zero just very very interesting

534.32 --> 541.44
video hey hello Mojo good to see

538.44 --> 541.44
you

551.44 --> 559.399
also had the shower Feel clean up

555.64 --> 561.16
again I think that's helping like the I

559.399 --> 564.2
think I just in this period need to take

561.16 --> 565.7199999999999
more regular showers than I'm used to

564.2 --> 568.6400000000001
and it does

565.72 --> 571.36
help against like the bad moods and all

568.64 --> 571.36
that

574.279 --> 578.92
right so yeah I'm doing great right now

576.8 --> 580.8
but I'm a bit of a blank

578.92 --> 584.5999999999999
slate

580.8 --> 584.5999999999999
no hey a man go

584.92 --> 590.89
with no I've never worn a

587.92 --> 594.12
hat got any more stupid

590.89 --> 594.12
[Music]

595.16 --> 598.16
questions

598.32 --> 601.32
uh

622.74 --> 628.32
[Music]

624.48 --> 631.32
okay let's turn off this noise

628.32 --> 631.32
maker

631.76 --> 634.079
it's

634.67 --> 637.8499999999999
[Music]

640.55 --> 644.0899999999999
[Music]

644.519 --> 651.12
better yeah everything keeps

647.76 --> 651.12
rolling out

653.519 --> 658.0
there watching FL Earth early bird

658.24 --> 661.24
1992

664.88 --> 672.04
H rewatching that yeah thanks yeah no it

668.36 --> 675.5600000000001
was a very great show it was like

672.04 --> 677.7199999999999
the real summarization show very proud

675.56 --> 677.7199999999999
of

681.279 --> 687.0
it also downloaded it to make sure

684.44 --> 687.0
that's not

688.24 --> 691.24
lost

698.72 --> 706.3100000000001
hello alcot good to see

702.31 --> 706.31
[Music]

708.76 --> 712.11
[Music]

714.68 --> 719.8
you but yeah talking about which

717.04 --> 724.16
technique the technique I'm really

719.8 --> 730.68
making pretty heavy progress with

724.16 --> 730.68
it like heavy progress with it I

731.36 --> 738.92
basically did some things with my friend

735.0 --> 741.639
and at a distance and it's

738.92 --> 745.0
just I was just able to do all these

741.639 --> 747.16
things at a distance and very

745.0 --> 750.76
rapidly like to the point where there

747.16 --> 752.4399999999999
was like that ch could literally see

750.76 --> 755.3199999999999
light

752.44 --> 757.8000000000001
appearing which is quite

755.32 --> 760.72
astounding and yeah all the ridicule in

757.8 --> 764.199
the world is not going to get me

760.72 --> 767.8000000000001
down it doesn't work can try to make fun

764.199 --> 771.3199999999999
of it all you like I'm growing

767.8 --> 775.24
strong very very strong at it I did not

771.32 --> 778.12
expect it to to

775.24 --> 780.92
become this

778.12 --> 782.68
reliable

780.92 --> 785.7199999999999
but I

782.68 --> 788.04
basically exercised an entire

785.72 --> 790.44
room at a

788.04 --> 793.639
distance never done that

790.44 --> 793.639
before it

797.46 --> 808.12
[Music]

802.44 --> 811.12
worked it's a quite exhilarating all of

808.12 --> 811.12
it

818.44 --> 824.36
I'm getting better control over

820.399 --> 826.0
it my understanding of it is much

824.36 --> 830.92
better

826.0 --> 830.92
and yeah it's not some Carnival

833.68 --> 837.959
trick and it's not meant for

838.04 --> 845.24
everybody

840.839 --> 845.24
as in you don't just get it for

850.72 --> 856.9590000000001
free like I get it for free CU I've

854.839 --> 861.6800000000001
attuned myself to doing that I've

856.959 --> 861.68
maneuvered my life to become able to do

862.36 --> 869.639
that and a lot of people out there

866.279 --> 872.0
simply won't cuz they will not not get

869.639 --> 874.839
their themselves a tune to be able to do

872.0 --> 876.519
that ever they'll spend the rest of

874.839 --> 879.44
their life just trying to mock it trying

876.519 --> 881.8
to play it down and say it's ridiculous

879.44 --> 885.12
just like with so many things out there

881.8 --> 885.12
in the world that are definitely

885.759 --> 892.6800000000001
real people just can't handle

889.56 --> 895.56
it and I'm all fine with that it's

892.68 --> 899.2399999999999
perfectly fine

895.56 --> 902.7199999999999
like I don't need people to accept it it

899.24 --> 906.16
out there at all it's not

902.72 --> 909.12
required I'm going to do it I got it I'm

906.16 --> 910.7199999999999
developing it getting really good at it

909.12 --> 913.839
it doesn't matter that a whole bunch of

910.72 --> 913.839
people don't accept

914.759 --> 924.639
it was a great show yeah I thought so

919.8 --> 927.519
too or maybe a few things missing within

924.639 --> 930.5600000000001
it but it's like at

927.519 --> 933.839
least 3 quarts 4

930.56 --> 936.04
fifths I basically put down all the the

933.839 --> 939.1990000000001
complicated subjects that I put forward

936.04 --> 942.7199999999999
during my YouTube career I summarized it

939.199 --> 946.56
all in that show and explained it very

942.72 --> 946.5600000000001
well I'm very proud of

957.92 --> 960.92
it

961.6 --> 966.399
yeah and the whole idea of fourth

964.04 --> 968.8
dimension and all that it might like

966.399 --> 972.68
might discuss a little bit more about

968.8 --> 976.24
it I know there's a it it it just

972.68 --> 979.88
enriches outside of physics though it

976.24 --> 982.88
becomes really spiritual

979.88 --> 982.88
and

984.72 --> 989.0400000000001
unprovable but it's still interesting

987.319 --> 991.4399999999999
like even things that are not proven

989.04 --> 991.4399999999999
able are

1009.959 --> 1013.8
interesting right sometimes it's just

1012.48 --> 1016.759
about the

1013.8 --> 1019.079
results like with the technique like oh

1016.759 --> 1022.12
how am I going to prove that oh we're

1019.079 --> 1024.36
going to prove well by the

1022.12 --> 1028.24
results

1024.36 --> 1031.7199999999998
and I can't like explain it through

1028.24 --> 1034.4
physics like I just can't it's I don't

1031.72 --> 1036.72
know where they even start with

1034.4 --> 1040.3600000000001
that but it's

1036.72 --> 1040.3600000000001
happening results are

1047.84 --> 1050.84
there

1053.799 --> 1059.8799999999999
all right also some strange

1055.799 --> 1063.08
experiences cuz in a way it is kind of

1059.88 --> 1067.64
magical and I had some weird ideas

1063.08 --> 1070.8799999999999
concerning it that as soon as I like

1067.64 --> 1073.16
started and to entertain that there was

1070.88 --> 1074.23
like an immediate backlash in a weird

1073.16 --> 1077.0
way

1074.23 --> 1081.32
[Music]

1077.0 --> 1083.679
like there's still rules ruls to it and

1081.32 --> 1086.6
it is

1083.679 --> 1087.799
like it's just strange how that all

1086.6 --> 1091.0
[Music]

1087.799 --> 1094.32
works like I was just thinking of like

1091.0 --> 1095.88
in a way oh what if you what if I could

1094.32 --> 1100.12
just

1095.88 --> 1101.7600000000002
like paint the technique or something

1100.12 --> 1106.6399999999999
and then just have a thing that just

1101.76 --> 1110.52
always does it but like

1106.64 --> 1112.4
immediately like that was like a a

1110.52 --> 1114.6
backlash

1112.4 --> 1117.64
energetically like the phone started to

1114.6 --> 1120.559
like disconnect and everything until I

1117.64 --> 1123.72
basically realized like wait what I

1120.559 --> 1125.44
thought of that's in a rudol siner sense

1123.72 --> 1128.24
luciferian like it's something you're

1125.44 --> 1128.24
not supposed to

1130.679 --> 1137.3200000000002
do it's almost like

1133.28 --> 1141.48
the idolatry effect or Graven and graven

1137.32 --> 1145.6
images like you're not supposed to put

1141.48 --> 1147.919
that magical action into a material

1145.6 --> 1151.9189999999999
object like

1147.919 --> 1155.44
that you're supposed to just do

1151.919 --> 1157.8400000000001
it and you can explain how how you can

1155.44 --> 1160.2
do it and then teach somebody

1157.84 --> 1162.559
else but you can't

1160.2 --> 1164.8400000000001
like

1162.559 --> 1167.08
immortalize that

1164.84 --> 1171.559
effect you can attempt it but it's

1167.08 --> 1175.52
highly distorting and it has esoteric

1171.559 --> 1179.36
reasons mainly that the spiritual realm

1175.52 --> 1181.96
the spiritual energies are in constant

1179.36 --> 1184.3999999999999
transformation and if you then do

1181.96 --> 1187.159
something and you anchor that

1184.4 --> 1189.72
spiritual effect into the

1187.159 --> 1192.5200000000002
physical then that becomes an

1189.72 --> 1194.799
obstruction to the overall spiritual

1192.52 --> 1196.36
Dynamic and transformation that is out

1194.799 --> 1200.6399999999999
there in the world at all

1196.36 --> 1200.6399999999999
time that's the reason

1204.84 --> 1208.84
and then as soon as I realized that like

1206.559 --> 1211.36
everything restored back to

1208.84 --> 1214.6789999999999
normal so yeah I had quite the magical

1211.36 --> 1214.6789999999999
conversation over the phone

1216.679 --> 1220.88
yesterday learned some things about

1223.679 --> 1231.76
it right without anybody having to tell

1226.52 --> 1235.1589999999999
me it's just like the universe

1231.76 --> 1237.08
responded God

1235.159 --> 1240.0
responded like

1237.08 --> 1245.48
to what was happening like what I was

1240.0 --> 1247.52
doing like I I went yeah unwittingly I

1245.48 --> 1250.76
got

1247.52 --> 1254.32
seduced by misapplying it Without Really

1250.76 --> 1256.8799999999999
realizing it just in like creative

1254.32 --> 1258.4399999999998
enthusiasm very similar to a lot of

1256.88 --> 1260.6000000000001
things that I was going through during

1258.44 --> 1263.28
my my goldsmithing

1260.6 --> 1267.799
period where I was kind of attempting

1263.28 --> 1271.3999999999999
such things but got a lot of

1267.799 --> 1275.32
resistance and eventually I gave that up

1271.4 --> 1277.919
also because at that time I

1275.32 --> 1279.559
wasn't I had a different

1277.919 --> 1283.5200000000002
Focus

1279.559 --> 1287.12
not energy healing and all that as

1283.52 --> 1287.12
much but other

1287.52 --> 1291.52
things

1289.48 --> 1294.2
and that was met with resistance in ways

1291.52 --> 1297.799
like I could do it but it wasn't

1294.2 --> 1303.2
good later I like basically

1297.799 --> 1306.679
released all of it like gave up on that

1303.2 --> 1309.679
and after that point it's just like yeah

1306.679 --> 1313.3600000000001
you're not supposed to do that you

1309.679 --> 1315.799
can you can communicate ideas and

1313.36 --> 1317.9599999999998
knowledge through

1315.799 --> 1319.84
symbols but you're not supposed to

1317.96 --> 1322.48
actually like

1319.84 --> 1322.48
enchant

1323.96 --> 1329.919
something yeah this this all sounds like

1326.4 --> 1329.919
complete wizard talk and it

1331.12 --> 1335.9599999999998
is so you don't have to believe it you

1333.4 --> 1338.48
don't have to understand it I just have

1335.96 --> 1341.72
to understand it and I'm sharing it

1338.48 --> 1341.72
because why the hell

1346.6 --> 1353.089
not hello did Gary do

1350.02 --> 1353.089
[Music]

1377.08 --> 1380.4399999999998
music h

1380.84 --> 1387.36
but man yeah that video from

1385.12 --> 1391.559
man

1387.36 --> 1393.7199999999998
H from mind unveiled first part China

1391.559 --> 1396.36
and the world war zero basically that

1393.72 --> 1400.24
was completely written out of History

1396.36 --> 1403.24
against a a whole group of

1400.24 --> 1406.36
people which were like said to

1403.24 --> 1409.32
be what are they called Chinese boxers

1406.36 --> 1412.4399999999998
or something don't remember exactly what

1409.32 --> 1415.2
what they called it but they had powers

1412.44 --> 1417.3200000000002
really FAS like they were claimed to

1415.2 --> 1421.799
be bullet

1417.32 --> 1425.8799999999999
proof like they could Shield themselves

1421.799 --> 1429.08
and basically like have Mage

1425.88 --> 1433.24
Armor that would prevent

1429.08 --> 1437.4399999999998
bullets from penetrating them and even

1433.24 --> 1440.36
like swords and all that they would

1437.44 --> 1443.4
deflect that is what is said about it

1440.36 --> 1443.3999999999999
it's all really

1443.6 --> 1449.559
mindblowing and I have little trouble

1446.72 --> 1449.559
believing in that

1450.72 --> 1455.88
too it's it's quite the magical story

1453.559 --> 1455.8799999999999
all of

1462.64 --> 1469.679
it all right man goes

1466.039 --> 1472.08
good talking about which I'm I woke up a

1469.679 --> 1472.0800000000002
little bit

1472.64 --> 1479.24
hungry I had french fries again last uh

1477.2 --> 1482.0800000000002
last evening which is like a long time

1479.24 --> 1486.0
ago but it it felt

1482.08 --> 1489.36
good I feel like I I've gone

1486.0 --> 1491.64
through the overall breakdown process

1489.36 --> 1494.8799999999999
and regeneration and I'm like really

1491.64 --> 1494.88
restoring back to

1496.24 --> 1502.72
like where I left off

1500.279 --> 1502.72
which is

1506.52 --> 1511.72
great right but I am going to turn on my

1509.559 --> 1514.8799999999999
coffee and put my Illuminati C on in the

1511.72 --> 1514.88
oven so I'll be right

1527.32 --> 1530.32
back

1557.24 --> 1560.24
e

1587.24 --> 1590.24
e

1594.76 --> 1598.279
I have a bit of a Scrapy

1611.52 --> 1617.36
throat the air is a bit cold

1615.159 --> 1619.72
though must be the moist there is a lot

1617.36 --> 1622.6
of moist in the air

1619.72 --> 1622.6000000000001
this does cool

1625.36 --> 1632.32
off right but yeah as a overall

1630.76 --> 1638.36
subject

1632.32 --> 1641.279
like that the boxing War which seemed to

1638.36 --> 1646.0
be like

1641.279 --> 1646.0
it I mean you have to have watched that

1647.159 --> 1651.679
video

1648.679 --> 1657.039
and you'll probably feel the same thing

1651.679 --> 1659.919
like there's just this major event that

1657.039 --> 1664.36
happened like really

1659.919 --> 1667.5590000000002
big that's just been completely erased

1664.36 --> 1667.559
very successfully

1668.799 --> 1674.84
erased but it's

1672.08 --> 1678.799
astounding it's like a mage

1674.84 --> 1682.279
war and I think that like it was a

1678.799 --> 1685.6399999999999
Jesuit War as well like I think that it

1682.279 --> 1689.039
was basically the Jesuits going

1685.64 --> 1691.519
after Christians other Christians cuz

1689.039 --> 1694.519
that they were

1691.519 --> 1694.519
Christian

1696.519 --> 1704.0
yeah so if you haven't watched this

1701.519 --> 1706.039
video and you want to have your mind

1704.0 --> 1709.039
seriously

1706.039 --> 1712.039
blown I recommend you watch watch

1709.039 --> 1715.2
this this

1712.039 --> 1718.08
afternoon instead of just drinking

1715.2 --> 1718.0800000000002
yourself to

1719.88 --> 1725.919
stupidity I really recommend it like I

1722.88 --> 1728.0800000000002
might watch it again as well it's really

1725.919 --> 1730.48
really mind

1728.08 --> 1735.519
lad it's just the first

1730.48 --> 1739.0
part but it is like really laying it

1735.519 --> 1743.36
down it it it is so fascinating I almost

1739.0 --> 1744.799
want to like see a movie about it like I

1743.36 --> 1748.24
want

1744.799 --> 1752.9189999999999
more this is a very very fascinating

1748.24 --> 1752.919
event that has happened and it involves

1753.919 --> 1760.679
tartaria like this event basically has

1758.0 --> 1763.08
to do with the fall of tartaria and

1760.679 --> 1763.0800000000002
after

1763.88 --> 1770.0390000000002
that like the tartarian empire was

1767.44 --> 1770.039
basically

1771.6 --> 1778.1589999999999
vable and then got cleaned out like

1775.039 --> 1782.919
United States got cleaned out of its

1778.159 --> 1787.159
remnants from that and all just muffled

1782.919 --> 1789.519
muffled away like it was it never really

1787.159 --> 1791.64
anything but you see more about that in

1789.519 --> 1795.0
the second

1791.64 --> 1797.039
parter just fascinating stuff guys

1795.0 --> 1800.039
really really

1797.039 --> 1800.039
fascinating

1801.08 --> 1808.279
perhaps like one of his best works from

1805.6 --> 1811.1999999999998
mindville although it's not one guy it's

1808.279 --> 1814.76
one that one guy narrating but they have

1811.2 --> 1818.88
a big team doing all this

1814.76 --> 1821.679
International and it is just really

1818.88 --> 1821.679
fascinating to

1821.98 --> 1826.029
[Music]

1826.96 --> 1829.96
me

1832.84 --> 1837.279
and if you consider these things then

1835.679 --> 1839.96
everything that has happened in the

1837.279 --> 1843.72
world you will just start to see it in a

1839.96 --> 1847.76
different light you will start to see

1843.72 --> 1850.76
reasons as to why things became the way

1847.76 --> 1852.72
they are you will start to understand

1850.76 --> 1858.32
that

1852.72 --> 1860.559
better what am I drinking uh minty

1858.32 --> 1862.4399999999998
nothing out of the ordinary I'm going to

1860.559 --> 1866.36
have coffee soon

1862.44 --> 1869.0800000000002
though cold iced tea later okay I had a

1866.36 --> 1871.6
bit of blood orange juice earlier which

1869.08 --> 1871.6
is always

1875.6 --> 1881.279
great I still had a lot of that I barely

1879.639 --> 1884.639
touched

1881.279 --> 1887.6
it but yeah I'm going to probably today

1884.639 --> 1889.039
have a whole bunch of good meals and

1887.6 --> 1893.32
everything

1889.039 --> 1893.32
cuz I feel very hungry I slept so

1893.399 --> 1898.399
well I like feel like really revitalized

1897.2 --> 1901.76
a

1898.399 --> 1901.76
lot it's

1902.399 --> 1907.279
interesting maybe

1904.32 --> 1909.4399999999998
it has something to do also that I did

1907.279 --> 1915.24
actually

1909.44 --> 1915.24
like again tried grains of

1915.36 --> 1922.12
hashes and this time

1918.76 --> 1922.12
it didn't give me

1925.639 --> 1932.639
paranoia it yeah so it's almost like

1928.559 --> 1932.639
there's a reset again

1933.039 --> 1940.08
already it's funny how that worked

1935.24 --> 1944.44
because first time was like around

1940.08 --> 1946.84
2003 I had to quit and I quit quite some

1944.44 --> 1949.3600000000001
time quite some

1946.84 --> 1951.6789999999999
time but

1949.36 --> 1955.559
then uh when was

1951.679 --> 1958.519
it I was with my ex I restarted it up I

1955.559 --> 1961.559
tried it out again and it had this major

1958.519 --> 1963.639
revitalizing influence on me like I

1961.559 --> 1967.32
would feel absolutely fantastic and

1963.639 --> 1969.32
rejuvenated and like became visibly

1967.32 --> 1974.279
younger from it I

1969.32 --> 1979.84
mean really like she would tell she was

1974.279 --> 1979.84
like wow what's happened

1980.08 --> 1983.8799999999999
but then if you basically start using it

1982.36 --> 1986.399
again and start using more and more and

1983.88 --> 1988.7990000000002
more then the same thing starts to

1986.399 --> 1991.639
reoccur which it

1988.799 --> 1994.32
has in the last

1991.639 --> 1997.08
decade and I

1994.32 --> 2000.24
quit

1997.08 --> 2001.6
again but now like just taking a couple

2000.24 --> 2005.36
of

2001.6 --> 2008.559
grains at the right time not all the

2005.36 --> 2010.6
time seems to have like a quite a

2008.559 --> 2013.519
regenerating

2010.6 --> 2015.799
function so and I still had the stuff

2013.519 --> 2018.519
left so it's but I have to be careful

2015.799 --> 2020.72
with it though I mean if I just like oh

2018.519 --> 2022.919
I just got to make a habit out of again

2020.72 --> 2024.799
and smoke all the time that that's

2022.919 --> 2026.72
probably not going to be good at all and

2024.799 --> 2029.0
hey I can't really afford it EI either

2026.72 --> 2029.0
way

2029.159 --> 2033.8400000000001
so I really do actually want to step

2031.88 --> 2036.72
away from the smoking and see if I

2033.84 --> 2039.72
instead could like get the

2036.72 --> 2039.72
oil

2041.0 --> 2047.24
that would

2042.679 --> 2051.2400000000002
be better to get CBD

2047.24 --> 2055.119
oil I've never actually tried it but I'm

2051.24 --> 2059.4799999999996
just in curious to see if that would

2055.119 --> 2061.0
have the same revitalizing influence

2059.48 --> 2064.2400000000002
like

2061.0 --> 2064.24
just like

2065.56 --> 2072.2
this taking a capuccino

2069.219 --> 2075.119
[Music]

2072.2 --> 2079.2
okay what what are you talking

2075.119 --> 2079.2000000000003
about cappuccino

2081.079 --> 2087.8
antioxidant maybe it does well look

2084.8 --> 2087.8
coffee

2087.839 --> 2095.0
basically forces like a lot of minerals

2090.839 --> 2098.64
and vitamins out of your system like it

2095.0 --> 2100.68
it it appeals to your IM

2098.64 --> 2104.52
emergency St

2100.68 --> 2106.16
stash of good stuff and that is what

2104.52 --> 2108.28
you're probably experiencing but

2106.16 --> 2109.0
especially if like cappuccino has milk

2108.28 --> 2112.0
in

2109.0 --> 2112.0
it

2113.76 --> 2118.3590000000004
uh it's not that great the man

2121.32 --> 2127.3590000000004
go I mean if you want to have like

2124.0 --> 2129.8
antioxidant properties like that I like

2127.359 --> 2132.3199999999997
cap Cho is not the best option I mean

2129.8 --> 2135.2000000000003
you might still enjoy it a

2132.32 --> 2136.2400000000002
lot not telling you not to do it it's

2135.2 --> 2139.2
just

2136.24 --> 2141.839
that it's probably just more the overall

2139.2 --> 2144.0789999999997
caffeine influence that you're enjoying

2141.839 --> 2146.32
and that gives you like an enthusiastic

2144.079 --> 2148.96
boost and all that in the periods where

2146.32 --> 2150.52
you can handle it other periods you

2148.96 --> 2152.04
can't handle it and then it'll just give

2150.52 --> 2155.16
you stomach ache or

2152.04 --> 2159.88
whatever but

2155.16 --> 2163.5989999999997
uh if you want that effect I'd rather go

2159.88 --> 2167.28
for like pure chocolate just

2163.599 --> 2169.3590000000004
a little block of like pure chocolate

2167.28 --> 2173.44
that would probably work better like

2169.359 --> 2177.56
that has those antioxidant properties

2173.44 --> 2178.76
without having the typical caffeine

2177.56 --> 2182.64
coffee

2178.76 --> 2182.6400000000003
type burdens on your

2183.359 --> 2189.56
body hello Duke

2185.44 --> 2189.56
Nukem good see you

2198.37 --> 2202.13
[Music]

2213.8 --> 2221.6400000000003
right but one way you could amplify the

2219.68 --> 2224.04
potential antioxidant properties of

2221.64 --> 2228.839
coffee is if you also take

2224.04 --> 2231.2799999999997
like supplements alongside it like

2228.839 --> 2231.2799999999997
vitamin

2236.04 --> 2242.8
C as for starters and some other things

2239.119 --> 2245.079
and then if you take coffee then you

2242.8 --> 2247.599
already

2245.079 --> 2250.3590000000004
have the stuff in your system it's it's

2247.599 --> 2252.8
not going to suck it out of your body as

2250.359 --> 2256.119
much

2252.8 --> 2258.0
right it's and there's been interesting

2256.119 --> 2260.56
coffees like in the past I don't know if

2258.0 --> 2260.56
they have it

2261.76 --> 2267.2000000000003
yet or if they have it still but

2264.48 --> 2270.56
Infowars like 10 years ago and more they

2267.2 --> 2272.4399999999996
had like this infused coffee where they

2270.56 --> 2274.839
just have this coffee and then it was

2272.44 --> 2278.48
infused with all this minerals and

2274.839 --> 2281.2
vitamin stuff well that is like that was

2278.48 --> 2284.079
a great idea I never actually got to

2281.2 --> 2286.9199999999996
test it I never been able to never

2284.079 --> 2290.0
prioritized to order that but that

2286.92 --> 2293.88
theoretically should work

2290.0 --> 2296.359
fantastically because it won't extracted

2293.88 --> 2296.359
from your

2299.599 --> 2303.96
body prevent oxidation that

2304.16 --> 2309.44
cholesterol uh sure man go

2310.4 --> 2313.44
but I mean it also depends on like the

2312.16 --> 2318.8799999999997
quality of your

2313.44 --> 2322.2400000000002
coffee it really does like coffee can be

2318.88 --> 2323.839
quite polluted and then it's not going

2322.24 --> 2325.9599999999996
to do any of those things it's going to

2323.839 --> 2330.16
make things worse but if you have like

2325.96 --> 2330.16
good organic quality

2332.0 --> 2338.28
coffee then yeah it might help you

2335.96 --> 2340.76
regulate as you say things like

2338.28 --> 2342.44
cholesterol and all that better although

2340.76 --> 2344.599
like yeah bad cholesterol because

2342.44 --> 2347.28
cholesterol technically isn't bad

2344.599 --> 2350.079
although hey if you want to mitigate bad

2347.28 --> 2352.0400000000004
cholesterol the way to do it is just to

2350.079 --> 2354.6400000000003
not take in bad

2352.04 --> 2356.88
cholesterol but taking good

2354.64 --> 2358.96
cholesterol if you had good cholesterol

2356.88 --> 2360.7200000000003
then your body will be having less

2358.96 --> 2363.119
trouble getting rid of the bad

2360.72 --> 2364.72
cholesterol because you don't need the

2363.119 --> 2365.6800000000003
cholesterol as much because you got the

2364.72 --> 2367.9599999999996
good

2365.68 --> 2370.3999999999996
one right

2367.96 --> 2373.119
the best that's why I said like even

2370.4 --> 2377.2000000000003
years ago I already knew that the way to

2373.119 --> 2379.88
get rid of bad fat is good fat is not

2377.2 --> 2382.9199999999996
like depriving yourself of fat and

2379.88 --> 2386.28
forcing it out of you it's get the good

2382.92 --> 2388.44
fat and then you get can get rid of the

2386.28 --> 2390.599
bad fat your body will just be like oh

2388.44 --> 2394.76
finally that's what we actually need now

2390.599 --> 2398.079
let's get up that rid of this substitute

2394.76 --> 2401.0
crap that's how that works and your

2398.079 --> 2401.0
liver does a lot of

2401.56 --> 2408.68
it sugary cappuccino well sugar is never

2405.0 --> 2408.68
really healthy

2410.92 --> 2417.52
lar get be more mentally alert yes sure

2414.56 --> 2420.7599999999998
and hey that also has it function like

2417.52 --> 2425.48
if you feel really motivated with

2420.76 --> 2428.0400000000004
it good morale is good for

2425.48 --> 2430.88
you right

2428.04 --> 2433.52
now unless you start to like use it and

2430.88 --> 2436.6800000000003
you notice like oh I have to drink a cup

2433.52 --> 2439.4
of coffee every hour because as soon as

2436.68 --> 2441.3999999999996
I don't then I I immediately get cranky

2439.4 --> 2442.76
well then you got a problem cuz then

2441.4 --> 2445.44
it's actually going to be a drain on

2442.76 --> 2448.2000000000003
your morality and your health so it's

2445.44 --> 2448.2000000000003
all about the

2449.72 --> 2455.359
balance yeah you can hide in here I'm

2452.16 --> 2455.359
going to hide you now

2456.24 --> 2459.24
bye

2461.0 --> 2467.839
right I'm going to get my Illuminati and

2463.8 --> 2467.8390000000004
coffee coffee up here right

2486.24 --> 2489.24

2561.119 --> 2566.839
coffee take yours without sugar oh good

2563.8 --> 2568.96
for you that's technically

2566.839 --> 2574.0
better I

2568.96 --> 2574.0
myself don't I do take it with sugar I

2575.16 --> 2580.8799999999997
just I find the taste it's kind of tough

2578.0 --> 2580.88
to bear without

2587.559 --> 2595.28
it check out that's a lot of

2592.28 --> 2595.28
coffee

2598.68 --> 2604.7999999999997
cheers I take the same amount of coffee

2601.16 --> 2608.1189999999997
I just put extra water in it I

2604.8 --> 2610.76
reckon hey uh

2608.119 --> 2613.2000000000003
I'm not taking more coffee I'll just put

2610.76 --> 2615.8
more water in it and then I got more

2613.2 --> 2619.0
coffee without using more

2615.8 --> 2619.0
coffee why

2620.599 --> 2625.7200000000003
not I'm realizing

2623.24 --> 2631.2799999999997
like I should probably try to find a

2625.72 --> 2634.2
balance like how much I can water it

2631.28 --> 2636.48
down or not water it down just like how

2634.2 --> 2637.9199999999996
little coffee would I need to get a lot

2636.48 --> 2641.16
of coffee

2637.92 --> 2641.16
and it's still being

2643.4 --> 2648.44
great easier me to quit smoking then the

2646.119 --> 2651.6400000000003
quit sugar well

2648.44 --> 2651.64
yeah I

2654.4 --> 2660.44
guess but I mean I don't like fill it up

2657.4 --> 2662.599
with sugar I just put enough with it

2660.44 --> 2665.7200000000003
that it has just a little bit of sweet

2662.599 --> 2669.1600000000003
taste I don't like it's not dude in the

2665.72 --> 2670.9199999999996
past I would have literally like two to

2669.16 --> 2674.3999999999996
three full

2670.92 --> 2676.2000000000003
Scoops or like in a coffee cup as big as

2674.4 --> 2679.2400000000002
this I would have had like four Scoops I

2676.2 --> 2682.4399999999996
put a lot of sugar in my coffee in the

2679.24 --> 2685.319
early days

2682.44 --> 2686.92
here during the Flat Earth talks and

2685.319 --> 2689.2799999999997
during the Early Bird shows when I

2686.92 --> 2691.559
started like I put a lot of sugar in

2689.28 --> 2694.079
that that wasn't good like that was

2691.559 --> 2694.079
giving me

2694.599 --> 2699.7200000000003
issues so I just Do It For The

2708.0 --> 2711.21
[Music]

2713.72 --> 2719.7999999999997
Taste

2715.48 --> 2722.76
yeah but I mean I quitting

2719.8 --> 2725.92
sugar I don't really need to quit sugar

2722.76 --> 2728.3190000000004
I don't take sugar as much I I put it in

2725.92 --> 2732.04
my coffee really that's the only place I

2728.319 --> 2732.04
put it in I don't use it in my

2732.16 --> 2737.1189999999997
tea I don't have like this need to have

2735.079 --> 2741.2000000000003
like sugary

2737.119 --> 2741.2000000000003
stuff on my bread or

2742.4 --> 2748.359
anything the only place that I actually

2745.0 --> 2752.48
still use like

2748.359 --> 2754.96
organic can sugar is in my coffee that's

2752.48 --> 2754.96
the only

2755.92 --> 2761.559
place

2758.599 --> 2765.2400000000002
and to be fair in the lacol there's also

2761.559 --> 2765.2400000000002
suar got to admit

2765.8 --> 2769.2400000000002
that but that's

2774.72 --> 2780.5589999999997
it do you ever smoke at all without weed

2779.16 --> 2782.839
uh

2780.559 --> 2785.76
yeah that's what I've been doing for

2782.839 --> 2785.7599999999998
like a month Steven

2785.92 --> 2791.52
Jarvis

2787.92 --> 2791.52
on that show where I really stressed

2792.319 --> 2799.96
out expected but certain bad

2795.52 --> 2802.2
news yeah I smoke cigarettes and I use

2799.96 --> 2803.92
the acti tube filters that I've

2802.2 --> 2807.1189999999997
basically

2803.92 --> 2809.359
kept because when I smoke joints in all

2807.119 --> 2809.359
these

2810.559 --> 2817.559
years sorry I smoke them and then I used

2815.64 --> 2821.24
the filter one time and I save it I put

2817.559 --> 2823.3190000000004
it back in a box in the box of

2821.24 --> 2825.04
secondhand stuff and I got tons of those

2823.319 --> 2827.72
and that's what I'm using as filter and

2825.04 --> 2829.839
it's saving me a lot of money and it

2827.72 --> 2832.5589999999997
does make smoking tobacco like less

2829.839 --> 2835.16
burdensome on the lungs it really

2832.559 --> 2837.6400000000003
provably to me

2835.16 --> 2840.0789999999997
does you can believe it or not believe

2837.64 --> 2845.44
it whatever you want I'm using those

2840.079 --> 2848.76
things it's been quite quite a

2845.44 --> 2851.319
help of making smoking less burdensome

2848.76 --> 2851.3190000000004
on it on

2854.88 --> 2861.2000000000003
me right so the AC

2857.44 --> 2861.2000000000003
tube and they're kind of

2861.28 --> 2865.92
expensive but yeah you can use them and

2864.2 --> 2870.2
then they're

2865.92 --> 2870.2000000000003
used and then you can still reuse

2871.4 --> 2875.28
them like for something

2875.4 --> 2883.28
like just the tobacco that works just

2880.52 --> 2886.319
fine it will still filter out like most

2883.28 --> 2886.3190000000004
of the tar and all

2889.88 --> 2893.0190000000002
[Music]

2897.48 --> 2903.0
that

2900.48 --> 2904.2
right so I'm going to take a bite out of

2903.0 --> 2905.76
this

2904.2 --> 2908.7599999999998
one

2905.76 --> 2908.76
cheers

2935.72 --> 2938.72
m

2952.88 --> 2955.599
that's just what I

2956.0 --> 2961.78
needed I did wake up kind of

2958.62 --> 2961.7799999999997
[Music]

2962.2 --> 2968.839
hungry can I buy organic tobacco uh it's

2966.4 --> 2970.559
not as silly question but the answer

2968.839 --> 2973.4
unfortunately is

2970.559 --> 2975.0400000000004
no there used to be the availability of

2973.4 --> 2979.839
it here in the

2975.04 --> 2979.839
Netherlands and then it all

2981.799 --> 2987.92
retracted it's all gone it's only it's

2985.2 --> 2990.2799999999997
mostly just crap that's left and I get

2987.92 --> 2992.64
the feeling that they're doing it on

2990.28 --> 2993.599
purpose it's just in the Netherlands has

2992.64 --> 2997.96
been

2993.599 --> 2999.92
this brutal anti- tobacco smoking

2997.96 --> 3002.28
policies really

2999.92 --> 3005.48
brutal and they're now even going to

3002.28 --> 3009.1600000000003
increase the tax on

3005.48 --> 3012.88
it by 50% of everything that it already

3009.16 --> 3012.8799999999997
costs it's it's

3016.079 --> 3020.92
outrageous and the only solution for me

3018.52 --> 3024.2
that's going to be viable is that I just

3020.92 --> 3024.2000000000003
order the the raw

3025.64 --> 3029.2
leaves

3027.16 --> 3031.319
as I done before in the past which like

3029.2 --> 3035.52
that's even better quality by a long

3031.319 --> 3035.52
stretch very way

3036.76 --> 3041.2400000000002
better so as soon as I can like muster

3039.599 --> 3044.48
the money get the money together for

3041.24 --> 3044.4799999999996
that I'm going to like do an

3048.48 --> 3055.64
order and then yeah I'll be cutting

3052.119 --> 3058.6400000000003
tobacco leaves again and just using

3055.64 --> 3058.64
that

3067.599 --> 3074.44
but I mean like all this tobacco taxes

3070.599 --> 3076.599
it is like totally outrageous it is it

3074.44 --> 3078.839
was already outrageous

3076.599 --> 3084.1600000000003
yeah there's like

3078.839 --> 3088.5589999999997
a 500% tax on it if if you can imagine

3084.16 --> 3088.5589999999997
that like it's just so crazy

3089.4 --> 3095.76
500% taxes just who makes up this

3093.559 --> 3097.96
[ __ ] and now they're going to increase

3095.76 --> 3097.96
it

3098.839 --> 3110.119
to 900% tax or 800 like just too

3106.599 --> 3110.119
much way too

3110.68 --> 3116.24
much it's outrageous and like there's

3114.44 --> 3117.559
going to be people like really angry

3116.24 --> 3120.0
about it

3117.559 --> 3122.48
and all supposedly under the guys of oh

3120.0 --> 3126.079
bad Health oh you get this issue dude

3122.48 --> 3127.48
you know what gets people cancer

3126.079 --> 3130.2400000000002
stressing out because they can't

3127.48 --> 3133.079
freaking afford anything anymore that's

3130.24 --> 3133.0789999999997
what gets people

3137.64 --> 3144.24
cancer

3140.0 --> 3146.92
stress stress of I just want to smoke a

3144.24 --> 3149.64
little to chill out on break or

3146.92 --> 3153.4
something and like you can't or you're

3149.64 --> 3155.44
not allowed to yeah that gets that makes

3153.4 --> 3159.119
people

3155.44 --> 3162.64
like get a chronic stress situation and

3159.119 --> 3164.6400000000003
that is typically what actually provably

3162.64 --> 3167.5589999999997
leads to

3164.64 --> 3169.2
cancer so it's it's all just sadistic

3167.559 --> 3170.88
it's all just

3169.2 --> 3174.52
this

3170.88 --> 3176.559
sick communist Rogue government here

3174.52 --> 3178.079
that is just making everything work

3176.559 --> 3179.6800000000003
worse everything they can they're making

3178.079 --> 3183.319
worse

3179.68 --> 3183.319
everything including

3184.839 --> 3189.799
this how would a PCO 20 ready made I

3187.599 --> 3194.2400000000002
don't know I don't care I don't use that

3189.799 --> 3194.24
at all I don't know ready

3202.799 --> 3207.4
made but I think it's from what I've

3206.04 --> 3213.799
heard

3207.4 --> 3213.799
it'll be like 10 or something just

3219.319 --> 3226.359
insane it's like Venetian tourism prices

3225.0 --> 3229.76
at that

3226.359 --> 3234.359
point for the entire country just

3229.76 --> 3237.6800000000003
Venetian tourism prices I mean

3234.359 --> 3241.24
Venicia and Italy is notorious for

3237.68 --> 3245.1189999999997
having like absurd prices for their

3241.24 --> 3245.1189999999997
drinks that you get like

3246.64 --> 3253.52
absurd they're over 10 there yeah maybe

3249.28 --> 3253.52
England's doing it too could

3254.2 --> 3260.319
be I don't know I can't keep track of it

3256.76 --> 3263.88
anymore it's just becoming just

3260.319 --> 3265.7599999999998
monstrous but I can legally bypass it by

3263.88 --> 3267.599
just getting the raw Leaf like they

3265.76 --> 3270.19

3374.079 --> 3380.4
political smokers

3376.2 --> 3380.3999999999996
party I'm and I'm not even

3381.24 --> 3386.52
joking I'm so

3383.599 --> 3388.96
sick throughout my life smokers getting

3386.52 --> 3388.96
attacked

3389.359 --> 3392.359
everywhere

3393.44 --> 3396.64
like it's

3399.92 --> 3404.2400000000002
ridiculous yeah indeed like dude if I do

3402.72 --> 3407.2
that there's a good chance like there

3404.24 --> 3410.1189999999997
going to be tons of people voting for me

3407.2 --> 3412.0
because it's like I don't say like oh

3410.119 --> 3417.2400000000002
you yeah smoker

3412.0 --> 3420.52
rights as in leave us the [ __ ] alone

3417.24 --> 3423.2
like not saying oh we demand to be able

3420.52 --> 3426.88
to smoke in restaurants again and not

3423.2 --> 3428.5989999999997
even that it's like but if you're at

3426.88 --> 3431.76
like a public occasion then have a

3428.599 --> 3434.88
smoker's room or something at

3431.76 --> 3438.559
minimum and

3434.88 --> 3442.359
like get rid of those damn taxes that's

3438.559 --> 3447.3590000000004
first and foremost like no more

3442.359 --> 3454.16
taxes I would suggest a tax cap

3447.359 --> 3454.16
of 100% that can never be surpassed

3454.76 --> 3462.4
ever yeah no more than 100% tax

3459.44 --> 3466.4
ever and yeah that means basically

3462.4 --> 3470.2400000000002
taking down like 800% tax dude that it's

3466.4 --> 3472.559
going to have huge relief and I I can

3470.24 --> 3476.359
even promise you statistically an

3472.559 --> 3477.6800000000003
economic Bloom because of that and an

3476.359 --> 3481.96
economic

3477.68 --> 3485.839
Bloom by getting those taxes

3481.96 --> 3488.96
down people will be able to just

3485.839 --> 3491.799
have group conversations

3488.96 --> 3493.599
again and ask another for a cigarette

3491.799 --> 3496.44
without getting a cranky look like oh

3493.599 --> 3499.6800000000003
you're going to pay me right because

3496.44 --> 3504.2000000000003
it's way too expensive just like have

3499.68 --> 3507.64
the social smoking culture get it

3504.2 --> 3510.24
back probably solve H yeah dude I could

3507.64 --> 3510.24
solve

3514.079 --> 3520.6400000000003
everything it would solve absolutely

3516.4 --> 3523.96
everything dude if you reduce the taxes

3520.64 --> 3526.92
on Tobacco worldwide to no more than

3523.96 --> 3529.88
100% under any circumstance that that's

3526.92 --> 3535.039
all inclusive like cannot be higher in

3529.88 --> 3536.839
any form than 100% of the original price

3535.039 --> 3539.6400000000003
dude

3536.839 --> 3541.799
it would literally

3539.64 --> 3545.1189999999997
decrease

3541.799 --> 3547.0
like it would help increase population

3545.119 --> 3549.119
growth I'm saying

3547.0 --> 3553.0
it I'm saying

3549.119 --> 3555.6800000000003
it yeah but it's like oh it's so bad for

3553.0 --> 3558.799
no no you know what's bad for everybody

3555.68 --> 3562.24
gigantic insane taxes and fear pouring

3558.799 --> 3562.24
about everything all the

3563.64 --> 3568.0389999999998
time that's what's terrible for every

3569.799 --> 3576.52
body Diet Coke piss off no Diet Coke is

3594.44 --> 3600.359
evil actually

3597.64 --> 3605.64
I would suggest why don't you throw

3600.359 --> 3608.64
those taxes against soda drinks yeah why

3605.64 --> 3611.48
you make

3608.64 --> 3613.92
cocacola and those shitty companies

3611.48 --> 3618.92
there shitty anti-human predatory

3613.92 --> 3621.6800000000003
companies pay 500 to 800% taxes yeah how

3618.92 --> 3624.2000000000003
about that why did they go pay their

3621.68 --> 3624.2
shitty

3624.96 --> 3629.88
taxes

3627.4 --> 3629.88
that's my

3636.28 --> 3641.4
suggestion make tobacco affordable

3653.52 --> 3659.28
again stay away from your diet Coke and

3656.4 --> 3661.52
my right man oh hey you go drink your

3659.28 --> 3666.28
for

3661.52 --> 3666.28
Malahide and methal alcohol all you like

3668.4 --> 3672.28
dude I'm not stopping

3680.799 --> 3687.319
yet yeah go ahead some point it's going

3684.76 --> 3689.44
to be all good because you'll be

3687.319 --> 3691.119
blind then you can't see what you're

3689.44 --> 3694.88
typing or where you're going anymore

3691.119 --> 3694.88
then you don't have to nag me about

3695.44 --> 3700.799
it nothing like Diet Coke and smoke

3702.52 --> 3708.359
yeah nothing like methyl alcohol and

3705.839 --> 3711.319
form Malahide being made in your liver

3708.359 --> 3714.7599999999998
with your nice aspartame drink yes I

3711.319 --> 3714.7599999999998
know go right

3714.839 --> 3717.839

3721.42 --> 3727.079
[Music]

3724.559 --> 3727.079
hey Thor

3729.68 --> 3732.7999999999997
[Music]

3736.24 --> 3747.839
[Music]

3744.839 --> 3747.839
Casey

3758.99 --> 3771.0899999999997
[Music]

3774.839 --> 3777.839
h

3790.039 --> 3794.7200000000003
additives yes coach yeah additives a lot

3792.599 --> 3794.7200000000003
of

3794.92 --> 3802.359
it what I want to know

3798.319 --> 3804.88
is where are all these epidemics of

3802.359 --> 3806.279
cancer deaths like everybody died from

3804.88 --> 3809.44
lung cancer in

3806.279 --> 3811.359
the 17th and 18th century because

3809.44 --> 3812.88
everybody was smoking I

3811.359 --> 3816.839
mean

3812.88 --> 3820.6400000000003
literally it was like a cultural thing a

3816.839 --> 3822.2
man that wasn't a smoker would be seen

3820.64 --> 3826.52
as kind of a

3822.2 --> 3828.48
[ __ ] I'm not even joking I'm not joking

3826.52 --> 3831.48
that's literally how it was yeah it's a

3828.48 --> 3834.72
bit exaggerated

3831.48 --> 3837.92
maybe that they would think like that

3834.72 --> 3839.64
but oh so that means everybody died from

3837.92 --> 3841.2400000000002
lung cancer then all the men would just

3839.64 --> 3846.64
at some point

3841.24 --> 3846.64
like no no they did

3848.68 --> 3854.1189999999997
not

3850.96 --> 3854.119
yeah they

3855.64 --> 3860.0389999999998
didn't that [ __ ] started happening

3864.319 --> 3868.68
later it's aditives it's crap they put

3867.16 --> 3873.96
in

3868.68 --> 3877.279
there that's and other medical crazy

3873.96 --> 3877.279
[ __ ] but I

3879.359 --> 3885.2
mean in the 19th century like lung

3882.64 --> 3887.72
cancer was

3885.2 --> 3890.68
rare it's really a thing that it became

3887.72 --> 3890.68
a thing in the 20th

3890.76 --> 3895.2000000000003
century and then started to grow it it's

3893.039 --> 3899.079
like oh because we were suddenly smoking

3895.2 --> 3899.0789999999997
no that's just that's not

3899.44 --> 3910.64
logical everybody was smoking for

3905.079 --> 3910.6400000000003
centuries everyone was smoking for

3910.68 --> 3914.64
centuries nobody died from lung cancer

3913.24 --> 3918.4399999999996
that was

3914.64 --> 3918.44
rare it's so

3924.64 --> 3927.64
stupid

3929.92 --> 3934.96
am I saying those things uh I'm saying

3932.64 --> 3937.8799999999997
that I don't trust those studies at

3934.96 --> 3940.68
all I'm saying that if you have other

3937.88 --> 3942.88
situations and toxins and all that that

3940.68 --> 3944.24
it might contribute to it as a

3942.88 --> 3946.88
compounded

3944.24 --> 3948.4399999999996
situation if you're already unhealthy it

3946.88 --> 3951.799
probably wouldn't help

3948.44 --> 3955.319
you what I'm saying is that it as an

3951.799 --> 3958.0
exclusive thing doesn't do any of that

3955.319 --> 3961.7599999999998
because then history books would be

3958.0 --> 3964.279
filled with men all dying from lung

3961.76 --> 3965.7990000000004
cancer traditionally like everybody

3964.279 --> 3966.68
would have because they all freaking

3965.799 --> 3972.319
chain

3966.68 --> 3974.839
smoked all of them all men in the west

3972.319 --> 3977.319
did that for

3974.839 --> 3980.7599999999998
centuries that's what I'm saying I'm

3977.319 --> 3983.48
saying it doesn't add up that's what I'm

3980.76 --> 3986.0
saying

3983.48 --> 3989.72
understand I'm not making any medical

3986.0 --> 3993.119
claims and don't try that

3989.72 --> 3993.1189999999997
again hey L

food that's what they got getting

4124.319 --> 4128.2390000000005
breeding it's the food they

rich

4144.96 --> 4151.08
people yeah not the common man not the

4147.839 --> 4155.839
common man no they didn't have that they

4151.08 --> 4159.44
do they would smoke though yeah they'd

4155.839 --> 4159.44
live long

4164.359 --> 4177.370000000001
lives

4166.87 --> 4177.37
[Music]

4182.239 --> 4186.959999999999
end port yeah

4184.0 --> 4190.279
exactly

4186.96 --> 4191.56
alcohol the drinks they had yes Steven

4190.279 --> 4198.4400000000005
Jarvis you get

4191.56 --> 4201.6
it gout was a r man's disease the Common

4198.44 --> 4201.599999999999
Man didn't get

4201.8 --> 4210.0
it because they didn't consume all these

4206.48 --> 4212.879999999999
drinks and luxury foods and too much

4210.0 --> 4212.88
sugar etc

4219.36 --> 4225.679
etc right

4221.48 --> 4229.919999999999
but smoking back then was relative ly

4225.679 --> 4229.92
common after they established

4230.239 --> 4235.36
like

4232.88 --> 4238.88
plantations it became kind of cheap and

4235.36 --> 4241.44
then even the lower middle class would

4238.88 --> 4244.04
be able to afford tobacco and it would

4241.44 --> 4247.36
be like oh yeah we're all smoking we're

4244.04 --> 4249.04
all so good we're all so we're so much

4247.36 --> 4250.5199999999995
better than in medieval times that's

4249.04 --> 4253.44
basically what it was all about it was

4250.52 --> 4258.080000000001
all the trend

4253.44 --> 4260.4
yeah but all those that been going for

4258.08 --> 4263.48
centuries after that started happening

4260.4 --> 4266.0
and guess what they didn't all die from

4263.48 --> 4268.599999999999
lung cancer and all that it's just not

4266.0 --> 4268.6
true they

4269.08 --> 4274.44
didn't so whatever's been happening in

4271.6 --> 4276.04
the 20th century is something that's

4274.44 --> 4278.04
been happening in the 20th century

4276.04 --> 4280.159
didn't happen in the 19th century didn't

4278.04 --> 4284.04
happen in the 18th

4280.159 --> 4287.719
century so it doesn't add up it just

4284.04 --> 4291.0
doesn't it does not add

4287.719 --> 4293.76
up yeah and I'm not making any claims

4291.0 --> 4298.04
about oh what it does or does not

4293.76 --> 4300.1990000000005
do I I'm not going to fall for that trap

4298.04 --> 4301.96
yeah you can make your own medical

4300.199 --> 4304.719
claims all you

4301.96 --> 4308.2390000000005
like I'm not making any medical claims

4304.719 --> 4308.2390000000005
I'm just telling you it doesn't add

4310.239 --> 4317.239
up hey clutch LSG good to see

4314.239 --> 4317.239
you

4344.159 --> 4347.159

4357.04 --> 4365.6
those stats

from that's nonsense 40 to 42 that's

4370.12 --> 4378.88
nonsense that's medieval

4374.12 --> 4382.4
[ __ ] 19th century 4042 no

4378.88 --> 4384.92
way although average there was still

4382.4 --> 4384.92
more

4385.44 --> 4391.5599999999995
like like young deaths at a young age

4388.6 --> 4393.400000000001
kind of thing that would average out

4391.56 --> 4396.56
maybe to that but I mean people

4393.4 --> 4399.879999999999
definitely like easily made

4396.56 --> 4403.400000000001
60 like once you survive

4399.88 --> 4407.52
youth most did grow a lot

4403.4 --> 4411.32
older like higher on

4407.52 --> 4413.679
average than in medieval times where the

4411.32 --> 4417.12
conditions were just way worse and more

4413.679 --> 4420.36
stressful and with less food available

4417.12 --> 4423.96
that is a very important factor about it

4420.36 --> 4427.36
that in medieval times the the general

4423.96 --> 4430.6
public the peons would be deprived of

4427.36 --> 4434.04
food that significantly contributed to

4430.6 --> 4435.679
their lowering of their

4434.04 --> 4438.56
lifespan

4435.679 --> 4441.84
and that changed after the

4438.56 --> 4445.719
Renaissance more things became available

4441.84 --> 4448.4800000000005
but there were still issues

4445.719 --> 4452.28
and like there would still be cradle

4448.48 --> 4454.959999999999
deaths and all that and childhood deaths

4452.28 --> 4454.96
much more than

4456.52 --> 4464.4400000000005
now and that I guess lowered it to that

4459.8 --> 4468.1990000000005
4042 but I mean people definitely like a

4464.44 --> 4469.4
lot became 60 there's plenty of people

4468.199 --> 4474.48
with gray

4469.4 --> 4474.48
hair I mean plenty in that

4484.08 --> 4489.639
age it all depends though like what type

4487.32 --> 4492.12
of Industry you liveed and if you're

4489.639 --> 4494.52
like certain types of

4492.12 --> 4496.92
miners then you would be exposed to

4494.52 --> 4498.76
Contin toxicity which they hadn't really

4496.92 --> 4500.32
figured out yet and that would like

4498.76 --> 4502.12
certain professions would like

4500.32 --> 4504.4
relatively Die Young because they just

4502.12 --> 4504.4
get

4505.52 --> 4510.56
poison yeah child birth death that's

4507.92 --> 4513.28
right Stephen Jarvis and hey that is

4510.56 --> 4514.4800000000005
that is taken into that formula of the

4513.28 --> 4517.12
average

4514.48 --> 4520.04
lifespan seems ridiculous that they do

4517.12 --> 4524.199
that but that is

4520.04 --> 4526.8
truthful they did I'm looking at like

4524.199 --> 4529.36
people that didn't die in child birth

4526.8 --> 4531.679
I'm looking at the the people that were

4529.36 --> 4535.239
around how old would they typically

4531.679 --> 4537.84
get and they definitely made it past 40

4535.239 --> 4537.839999999999
definitely

4543.12 --> 4549.5199999999995
did why wouldn't they like there were

4546.4 --> 4549.5199999999995
more food

4550.48 --> 4556.239
available better

4553.92 --> 4560.92
economy

4556.239 --> 4560.919999999999
there was just a lot more to live

4568.15 --> 4576.139999999999
[Music]

4583.92 --> 4586.92
for

4588.22 --> 4593.52
[Music]

4591.199 --> 4593.5199999999995
that's

4594.88 --> 4601.36
right and even like that infant

4597.199 --> 4605.32
mortality has other pointers like what

4601.36 --> 4607.599999999999
made that happen well the

4605.32 --> 4611.159
industrialization caused a lot of

4607.6 --> 4614.360000000001
Industries a lot of toxins that go

4611.159 --> 4618.08
around that they didn't realize yet

4614.36 --> 4621.0
right that poison things poison well

4618.08 --> 4623.28
infants very sensitive to

4621.0 --> 4626.08
that mothers pregnant mothers would

4623.28 --> 4629.96
basically get drenched in like whatever

4626.08 --> 4631.84
toxic water toxic smoke in the cities

4629.96 --> 4634.76
and then that would basically create

4631.84 --> 4637.88
infant mortality right

4634.76 --> 4640.56
toxicity toxicity was the the biggest

4637.88 --> 4643.28
issue in the 19 century because of the

4640.56 --> 4646.639
industrialization that part has

4643.28 --> 4649.679
been gradually cleaned up and fixed in

4646.639 --> 4652.04
the 20th century especially after the

4649.679 --> 4652.04
half of

4652.4 --> 4660.44
it that decreased average infant

4657.44 --> 4660.44
mortality

4666.159 --> 4672.28
dramatically did die from incidents

4668.6 --> 4675.320000000001
that's yeah at jobs yes there were jobs

4672.28 --> 4677.719
were more hazardous clutch so that would

4675.32 --> 4677.719
also

4680.56 --> 4685.360000000001
happen but all those issues in the 19th

4683.44 --> 4688.799999999999
century from the new industrialized

4685.36 --> 4690.599999999999
world that were killing people have

4688.8 --> 4695.76
mostly

4690.6 --> 4695.76
been wiped clean in the 20th

4696.36 --> 4706.44
century but then like a whole range of

4700.44 --> 4712.96
new ways of going about medically uhhuh

4706.44 --> 4712.96
have uh probably uh pushed that back a

4723.199 --> 4729.12
little Industrial Revolution increased

4726.28 --> 4732.84
life expect mid 18th

4729.12 --> 4736.32
century yeah sure now it yeah but the

4732.84 --> 4738.52
reason for that is because of the mechan

4736.32 --> 4741.239
mechanisms that would take it like the

4738.52 --> 4742.88
the dirtiest of Dirty Work could be done

4741.239 --> 4745.879999999999
with machines so there wouldn't be

4742.88 --> 4749.76
people like literally getting ground up

4745.88 --> 4755.2390000000005
just doing those tasks as it's always

4749.76 --> 4759.360000000001
been but also beside that the Industrial

4755.239 --> 4762.799999999999
Revolution like just created

4759.36 --> 4765.239
new new resources were being mined and

4762.8 --> 4767.76
all that that's

4765.239 --> 4770.759999999999
that's been a big

4767.76 --> 4773.76
influence

4770.76 --> 4773.76
like

4773.96 --> 4780.36
chemistry chemical

4777.159 --> 4782.36
revolutions like all of that the there

4780.36 --> 4785.36
were new Industries I mean in medieval

4782.36 --> 4787.0
times there there would be mining but

4785.36 --> 4789.12
there was just a few types of things

4787.0 --> 4790.92
that would be mining and then during the

4789.12 --> 4793.639
Industrial Revolution there were just a

4790.92 --> 4796.1990000000005
lot more different types of

4793.639 --> 4800.159000000001
Industries different materials that they

4796.199 --> 4802.239
would now need and start Mining and that

4800.159 --> 4805.638999999999
specifically is what I'm saying

4802.239 --> 4809.28
contributed to more toxicity so yeah the

4805.639 --> 4812.1990000000005
machines might have lightened the the

4809.28 --> 4812.199
burden of the

4813.199 --> 4820.879999999999
worker but the overall

4817.32 --> 4823.159
toxic side effects were still

4820.88 --> 4827.4400000000005
influencing

4823.159 --> 4831.239
Society the smoke Stacks with unscrubbed

4827.44 --> 4833.04
smoke were still like just settling on

4831.239 --> 4837.239
the land

4833.04 --> 4839.6
and influ nature and the cities and the

4837.239 --> 4841.36
air quality that that's just a provable

4839.6 --> 4843.8
fact it's historical

4841.36 --> 4848.599999999999
fact yeah those Industries with those

4843.8 --> 4848.6
Smoke Stacks they weren't there

4849.159 --> 4853.638999999999
before any pollution would be directly

4852.719 --> 4857.639
from

4853.639 --> 4860.36
mining like most historically known like

4857.639 --> 4862.1990000000005
gold mining they would use mercury there

4860.36 --> 4864.719
would be Mercury around everywhere well

4862.199 --> 4866.159
Mercury is like highly toxic it would

4864.719 --> 4868.679
ruin the

4866.159 --> 4870.638999999999
fishes and the the the miners would go

4868.679 --> 4874.96
crazy from

4870.639 --> 4879.36
it right that's a very old

4874.96 --> 4879.36
thing it's like in medieval times

4879.4 --> 4883.5599999999995
even but during the industrialization

4881.88 --> 4885.32
there were just

4883.56 --> 4887.88
more

4885.32 --> 4889.96
factories and smoke

4887.88 --> 4893.400000000001
stacks

4889.96 --> 4896.8
like so that would like cast out all

4893.4 --> 4901.239
this pollution everywhere that's a big

4896.8 --> 4901.2390000000005
influence yeah you got timed out that's

4909.37 --> 4915.48
[Music]

4913.52 --> 4917.52
right

4915.48 --> 4919.199
was it the photons yeah it was making

4917.52 --> 4922.0
stupid

4919.199 --> 4923.879999999999
remarks yeah do it one more time and

4922.0 --> 4926.639
you're

4923.88 --> 4928.76
banned no [ __ ] around in here this is

4926.639 --> 4930.12
serious conversation and if you're just

4928.76 --> 4933.159000000001
going to joke around I'm kick you the

4930.12 --> 4933.159
[ __ ] out you got

4936.76 --> 4941.280000000001
it hello Richard G by the way I could

4939.04 --> 4941.28
see

4943.52 --> 4946.52
you

4963.199 --> 4971.36
yeah so yeah Thor KC what you said

4966.88 --> 4973.8
it's those are just statistical stuff is

4971.36 --> 4976.44
that for stupid okay well then you're

4973.8 --> 4976.4400000000005
banned bye

4977.28 --> 4981.04
hi no more [ __ ]

5002.92 --> 5006.4400000000005
around hey

5021.48 --> 5025.199
King what are you talking

5033.44 --> 5036.44
about

5037.32 --> 5043.159
spent one hour in his slate mind

5040.159 --> 5043.159
terrifying

5063.32 --> 5068.48
was

5066.13 --> 5070.28
[Music]

5068.48 --> 5071.48
right so whatever you're going to think

5070.28 --> 5074.96
of

5071.48 --> 5077.919999999999
it I personally want to push back

5074.96 --> 5081.159
against this anti-tobacco Insanity

5077.92 --> 5084.8
that's been happening for like two

5081.159 --> 5088.32
decades and I want to like put a tax cap

5084.8 --> 5088.320000000001
on it a permanent tax

5088.92 --> 5095.76
cap that the tax just can't be higher

5093.76 --> 5099.679
than 100

5095.76 --> 5101.119000000001
% in any combination so oh but this is

5099.679 --> 5105.84
going up oh well then the rest's going

5101.119 --> 5108.32
to go down just no more than 100% on top

5105.84 --> 5111.679
of the original

5108.32 --> 5113.84
cost and that is it like that is then

5111.679 --> 5116.32
final and then no

5113.84 --> 5119.32
more no more

5116.32 --> 5123.5199999999995
issues and then people can just afford

5119.32 --> 5125.92
it there should still be like I guess

5123.52 --> 5129.159000000001
warnings or whatever like hey don't

5125.92 --> 5132.04
chain smoke all the time I mean yeah I

5129.159 --> 5134.08
get it don't chain smoke all the time

5132.04 --> 5136.8
right I mean people are still going to

5134.08 --> 5138.8
do it anyway like even if they wouldn't

5136.8 --> 5141.04
be able to afford it they just spent all

5138.8 --> 5145.360000000001
their money on still doing that because

5141.04 --> 5149.159
people just do that yeah I mean the

5145.36 --> 5151.88
price of illegal heroin or something

5149.159 --> 5154.5199999999995
isn't exactly stopping heroin addicts

5151.88 --> 5158.92
from getting it at that high price

5154.52 --> 5162.080000000001
anyway am I right so it's making it more

5158.92 --> 5165.36
expensive is not a deterrent it just

5162.08 --> 5165.36
makes things worse for

5169.119 --> 5174.719
everybody right and I just want this

5172.0 --> 5174.719
nonsense to

5183.239 --> 5186.239
stop

5188.14 --> 5191.209000000001
[Music]

5194.28 --> 5200.67

[Music]

5221.0 --> 5224.43
[Music]

5228.56 --> 5234.360000000001
SRP smokers rights party so it's the

5234.96 --> 5240.119
title if you did stand what would you

5237.84 --> 5243.119000000001
call political

5240.119 --> 5246.119
party uh I think I the smoker's rights

5243.119 --> 5246.119
party

5251.96 --> 5256.6
that's right Thor casy and that's the

5253.6 --> 5259.4400000000005
whole point for me is I just want the

5256.6 --> 5262.8
nonsense to end I want this nonsense

5259.44 --> 5267.28
paranoia [ __ ] to end and I want smokers

5262.8 --> 5270.8
to be allowed to just have their smoker

5267.28 --> 5273.119
culture to have I mean I'm not saying

5270.8 --> 5276.6
like oh there has to be a smoking table

5273.119 --> 5279.799999999999
again in a restaurant right but then at

5276.6 --> 5282.320000000001
least have a smoker's room that's

5279.8 --> 5285.52
ventilated and everything for a while

5282.32 --> 5288.119
that's been around and I as a smoker

5285.52 --> 5290.52
liked it I liked that there was a

5288.119 --> 5292.36
smoker's room I go to the smoker's room

5290.52 --> 5295.4400000000005
I smoke I talk with other smokers and

5292.36 --> 5299.239
it's like yeah cool then I'm done I walk

5295.44 --> 5302.759999999999
out of it and then it's like non-smoke

5299.239 --> 5306.04
air this is great I like as a smoker I

5302.76 --> 5310.92
liked that you weren't allowed to smoke

5306.04 --> 5314.199
everywhere got it I liked it but I don't

5310.92 --> 5318.6
want to just have like no no smoking at

5314.199 --> 5322.199
all ever that's just totally

5318.6 --> 5324.400000000001
evil and it it ruined the culture

5322.199 --> 5327.599999999999
because there is this thing that smokers

5324.4 --> 5330.08
do like have smokers conversations and

5327.6 --> 5330.08
it's

5332.199 --> 5336.04
stimulating there's a culture

5334.56 --> 5339.360000000001
component to

5336.04 --> 5343.08
it and that cultural component has been

5339.36 --> 5345.36
under severe attack psychologically and

5343.08 --> 5348.92
economically and I want it to

5345.36 --> 5348.92
end leave it

5353.32 --> 5359.4
alone can you stand as an independ no

5357.119 --> 5362.719
you're gonna dude I'm

5359.4 --> 5366.199
Dutch if you think this is a great idea

5362.719 --> 5369.4800000000005
then well you could stand up and become

5366.199 --> 5371.239
the UK smokers part rights

5369.48 --> 5374.28
party

5371.239 --> 5378.0
guy I mean nobody's stopping that from

5374.28 --> 5382.32
happening right we got over here we got

5378.0 --> 5382.32
like party for

5382.679 --> 5388.679
animals like animal rights and like just

5386.84 --> 5391.2390000000005
like people who love animals like that's

5388.679 --> 5393.679
a thing they've been out there for for a

5391.239 --> 5396.04
decade or something they've kind of

5393.679 --> 5396.04
become

5396.119 --> 5400.719
yeah not reliable at all they kind of

5398.8 --> 5403.400000000001
became Marxist

5400.719 --> 5405.8
unfortunately sucks really does suck

5403.4 --> 5408.32
like they're just [ __ ] gross now but

5405.8 --> 5412.6
they started out pretty

5408.32 --> 5416.0
good smoker rights party would naturally

5412.6 --> 5419.4800000000005
be a more right-wing leaning party it

5416.0 --> 5422.36
would attract those types of people more

5419.48 --> 5424.678999999999
which doesn't prevent such a party

5422.36 --> 5425.92
system from eventually in kind of

5424.679 --> 5429.0
right-wing

5425.92 --> 5431.96
establishment but I mean yeah what can

5429.0 --> 5434.32
you do but the point is I want there to

5431.96 --> 5438.08
be a SM Smoker's rights party I want

5434.32 --> 5443.44
them to exist just to stop

5438.08 --> 5443.44
this this attack a cultural

5443.56 --> 5449.92
attack and it is like a leftwing

5446.92 --> 5452.92
cultural attack it's it's lefties that

5449.92 --> 5454.88
are doing that they're attacking

5452.92 --> 5456.6
smokers

5454.88 --> 5459.639
so there should

5456.6 --> 5460.88
be a counterbalance and the smoker's

5459.639 --> 5464.2390000000005
rights

5460.88 --> 5467.2390000000005
party is my idea I want

5464.239 --> 5467.239
it

5469.96 --> 5475.36
and

5472.36 --> 5477.839999999999
yeah if I get people that are like

5475.36 --> 5480.48
genuinely interested and they should be

5477.84 --> 5482.400000000001
they should be genuinely interested then

5480.48 --> 5485.919999999999
who knows maybe I can like do something

5482.4 --> 5485.92
with it

5486.52 --> 5492.119000000001
right I'm mostly here to like bring

5489.56 --> 5494.56
forth the idea though because I still

5492.119 --> 5497.28
I'm like a I'm no I'm a nobody

5494.56 --> 5500.320000000001
technically I'm just this weird hermit

5497.28 --> 5503.44
guy still living off social welfare oh

5500.32 --> 5505.679
how dare you and like but the point is

5503.44 --> 5509.239
is that there's a lot of people that are

5505.679 --> 5512.84
like in grief over this cultural attack

5509.239 --> 5515.839999999999
that has happened in the last 30

5512.84 --> 5515.84
years

5517.52 --> 5521.400000000001
I think there was a smoker's rice party

5519.719 --> 5524.8
oh

5521.4 --> 5528.28
okay well then there should be it should

5524.8 --> 5531.08
return cuz it's still getting attacked

5528.28 --> 5531.08
and it should

5542.84 --> 5545.84
return

5546.44 --> 5553.879999999999
right but it should not be overdone like

5551.08 --> 5556.92
for example in my view if I would be

5553.88 --> 5559.56
representing the smoker's rights party

5556.92 --> 5563.0
that doesn't mean like oh we're going to

5559.56 --> 5564.88
like really overdo it and like oh every

5563.0 --> 5568.04
time I get caught on camera I'm going to

5564.88 --> 5569.52
be smoking a cigarette or something no

5568.04 --> 5572.199
it's not about that it's not about oh

5569.52 --> 5574.4400000000005
everybody smoke everybody no it's not an

5572.199 --> 5576.159
advertisement for tobacco

5574.44 --> 5580.799999999999
that's not what it's

5576.159 --> 5584.5599999999995
about it's about leave us the hell

5580.8 --> 5588.04
alone stop increasing the burden on

5584.56 --> 5590.84
smokers stop doing that that's what it's

5588.04 --> 5592.119
about so it's like as the smoker rights

5590.84 --> 5594.28
party

5592.119 --> 5596.44
representative I wouldn't smoke on

5594.28 --> 5599.44
screen I would

5596.44 --> 5602.239
not I don't think that's good I don't

5599.44 --> 5604.32
want to like oh look at me I'm so cool

5602.239 --> 5607.28
I'm a smoker and then like get children

5604.32 --> 5609.04
to to start doing I don't want that I

5607.28 --> 5611.239
don't want children to smoke I wouldn't

5609.04 --> 5615.5199999999995
want my children to smoke you

5611.239 --> 5618.879999999999
see but the fact remains there are

5615.52 --> 5621.8
smokers I think they have a right to do

5618.88 --> 5625.56
that and it should be

5621.8 --> 5627.28
balanced like don't burden other people

5625.56 --> 5632.719
with

5627.28 --> 5636.639
it but you should have your space to do

5632.719 --> 5639.199
that so a balanced approach and then

5636.639 --> 5642.96
locked in like that balanced approach

5639.199 --> 5645.678999999999
and like that's the line and you don't

5642.96 --> 5648.52
cross it you don't heighten the taxes

5645.679 --> 5650.96
anymore you don't attack smokers you

5648.52 --> 5653.159000000001
don't forbid

5650.96 --> 5656.84
them that's what it's about that's what

5653.159 --> 5661.0
my idea of the smoker rights party is

5656.84 --> 5664.719
about smoking ban everywhere I am well

5661.0 --> 5666.84
yeah pretty much Steven Jarvis it is is

5664.719 --> 5670.4
and the most ridiculous version of that

5666.84 --> 5675.119000000001
is that in the coffee shops you're not

5670.4 --> 5676.119
allowed to smoke tobacco yeah how insane

5675.119 --> 5680.08
is

5676.119 --> 5682.48
that in a coffee shop the Cannabis C

5680.08 --> 5685.84
like you're not allowed to smoke tobacco

5682.48 --> 5687.959999999999
now that's how far they pushed it it's

5685.84 --> 5690.76
absolutely

5687.96 --> 5692.639
outrageous

5690.76 --> 5695.639
outrageous

5692.639 --> 5695.639
insane

5696.92 --> 5702.4
I think it's evil it really feels evil

5700.6 --> 5705.2390000000005
that they've done

5702.4 --> 5708.0
that who the [ __ ] do you think they

5705.239 --> 5710.5599999999995
are that's right not even outside just

5708.0 --> 5713.08
nowhere you're not allowed to do it

5710.56 --> 5715.719
anywhere in restaurants they have no

5713.08 --> 5718.639
more smoking section no more in in going

5715.719 --> 5721.28
out places like you have to like go

5718.639 --> 5723.92
outside

5721.28 --> 5726.239
now and not even in front of the it's

5723.92 --> 5731.679
like they're just being chased away and

5726.239 --> 5734.5599999999995
it's I'm I'm done I'm done with that

5731.679 --> 5737.96
[ __ ] Smoker's

5734.56 --> 5741.159000000001
rights leave them the hell alone stop

5737.96 --> 5744.96
stigmatizing it stop financially

5741.159 --> 5748.679
burdening it yeah that's what makes

5744.96 --> 5752.119
people physically ill The NeverEnding

5748.679 --> 5754.32
nagging and pushing and burdening that's

5752.119 --> 5758.5199999999995
is what makes people ill

5754.32 --> 5758.5199999999995
not the freaking smoking man it's

5761.6 --> 5769.280000000001
[ __ ] smoker rights I want it back

5766.28 --> 5769.28
I'm done with all this

5770.28 --> 5777.8
[ __ ] right and who knows maybe in the

5774.119 --> 5779.719
future I will even quit smoking yeah I

5777.8 --> 5783.2390000000005
would even might even just do it smoking

5779.719 --> 5787.159
all together but I'd still be part of

5783.239 --> 5790.48
the smoker rights party because I think

5787.159 --> 5792.759999999999
it really should stop this nonsense

5790.48 --> 5797.48
attack on smokers must

5792.76 --> 5800.159000000001
stop it's terrible it's terrible on

5797.48 --> 5802.48
everybody even if I wasn't a smoker it's

5800.159 --> 5805.159
not about oh I just want to be left

5802.48 --> 5807.919999999999
alone personally so that's why I'm no I

5805.159 --> 5812.5199999999995
think universally people should leave

5807.92 --> 5814.639
the damn smokers alone I'm sick of that

5812.52 --> 5816.84
culture

5814.639 --> 5819.0
that culture of like pecking away at

5816.84 --> 5821.84
smokers and ridiculing

5819.0 --> 5825.639
and like accusing them like oh you're

5821.84 --> 5828.1990000000005
attacking my health [ __ ] you your

5825.639 --> 5830.88
psychological sickness is what's

5828.199 --> 5833.638999999999
attacking other people's Health yeah not

5830.88 --> 5836.2390000000005
somebody just trying to enjoy a smoke

5833.639 --> 5838.08
somewhere yeah they're not blowing it in

5836.239 --> 5842.04
your face

5838.08 --> 5842.04
dick leave them the hell

5842.52 --> 5845.52
alone

5846.97 --> 5850.169
[Music]

5852.56 --> 5857.52
right Steven Jarvis well look if you

5855.36 --> 5862.04
have little

5857.52 --> 5862.040000000001
children there is something to argue for

5862.159 --> 5869.44
that in a way I agree that like yeah if

5866.76 --> 5873.8
you're a smoker you got children you

5869.44 --> 5876.598999999999
should go outside or have a special

5873.8 --> 5879.320000000001
little room

5876.599 --> 5881.360000000001
outside so that you don't get yeah you

5879.32 --> 5884.5599999999995
can still smoke without it getting blown

5881.36 --> 5886.4
out or rained all the hell but you

5884.56 --> 5890.679
should if you're like a

5886.4 --> 5892.598999999999
smoker have a special room outside so

5890.679 --> 5894.76
that you're not smoking in the presence

5892.599 --> 5898.719
in the same room with your kids I do

5894.76 --> 5898.719
agree with that you

5899.119 --> 5904.5199999999995
see I am not like some fanatical smoker

5903.199 --> 5906.879999999999
guy

5904.52 --> 5911.76
like oh screw that everybody like oh

5906.88 --> 5915.56
just lower the age of smoking to eight

5911.76 --> 5919.88
something ridiculous like no no

5915.56 --> 5923.56
no I just want the ever increasing

5919.88 --> 5927.1990000000005
pressure to try to like we have to get

5923.56 --> 5931.56
the world rid of smoking tobacco forever

5927.199 --> 5934.638999999999
like that has to stop it has to

5931.56 --> 5937.76
stop that's all

5934.639 --> 5940.8
I'm all up for a reasonable Middle

5937.76 --> 5943.400000000001
Ground there was a time when there was a

5940.8 --> 5944.92
reasonable middle ground and then it

5943.4 --> 5946.5199999999995
just kept pushing it away and then there

5944.92 --> 5948.159
was no more reasonable Middle Ground now

5946.52 --> 5949.88
the reasonable Middle Ground is like

5948.159 --> 5952.759999999999
forbit smoking

5949.88 --> 5954.52
forever that was the supposed reasonable

5952.76 --> 5956.280000000001
Middle Ground they just would keep

5954.52 --> 5957.92
pushing and pushing and pushing and they

5956.28 --> 5960.5599999999995
wouldn't

5957.92 --> 5963.639
stop and they're still pushing it and

5960.56 --> 5965.84
I'm sick of it I'm [ __ ] sick of the

5963.639 --> 5968.4400000000005
doing that [ __ ] all the [ __ ] time and

5965.84 --> 5971.0
then never ending the pushing it needs

5968.44 --> 5971.0
to

5973.119 --> 5979.759999999999
stop yeah if you're a smoker you got

5977.199 --> 5982.5199999999995
little kids then I agree you shouldn't

5979.76 --> 5985.1990000000005
do that in the room in which your little

5982.52 --> 5987.56
kids are I agree with that

5985.199 --> 5991.598999999999
notion you should

5987.56 --> 5996.88
think how can I smoke

5991.599 --> 5999.84
outside or away away from the kids in a

5996.88 --> 6004.28
separate little room that's ventilated

5999.84 --> 6006.719
or an outside room like a covered

6004.28 --> 6008.5599999999995
outside place where you then always do

6006.719 --> 6011.88
your smoking not

6008.56 --> 6014.639
inside I think that that is something

6011.88 --> 6017.639
that should

6014.639 --> 6019.76
be made like that people that are

6017.639 --> 6024.76
smokers and have kids should absolutely

6019.76 --> 6027.679
think like that and account for that

6024.76 --> 6027.679
does it harm

6032.08 --> 6038.44
kids they shouldn't be in the presence

6034.4 --> 6040.92
of smoking that's just my opinion I'm

6038.44 --> 6043.119
not concerned with harm in this case

6040.92 --> 6048.159
it's just telling you this is how I

6043.119 --> 6048.159
think yeah just leave it

6050.48 --> 6057.32
alone yeah when I was a kid I thought it

6054.36 --> 6059.839999999999
was unpleasant because my parents were

6057.32 --> 6061.639
tobacco smokers when I was a kid and I

6059.84 --> 6065.679
thought it was very unpleasant when they

6061.639 --> 6068.76
were smoking inside and I was there I

6065.679 --> 6069.96
protested them as a little kid together

6068.76 --> 6072.679
with my

6069.96 --> 6074.28
brother we would like even like hide the

6072.679 --> 6075.88
cigarettes and all that because it was

6074.28 --> 6079.5199999999995
very serious to us like we didn't want

6075.88 --> 6082.679
them to do that so I agree you shouldn't

6079.52 --> 6084.360000000001
smoke in the presence of kids but that

6082.679 --> 6086.639
doesn't mean like oh you can't smoke

6084.36 --> 6090.36
ever again it just means you need to

6086.639 --> 6094.08
then accommodate for your smoking habit

6090.36 --> 6094.08
have a separate room for

6094.32 --> 6101.44
it and not make a habit of just smoking

6097.119 --> 6104.759999999999
wherever you're walking I agree to

6101.44 --> 6108.96
that the Middle

6104.76 --> 6112.2390000000005
Road sensible be sensible about it don't

6108.96 --> 6115.2390000000005
destroy it just be sensible about

6112.239 --> 6115.239
it

6120.4 --> 6127.638999999999
right that's

6123.239 --> 6128.959999999999
it that's the opinions of the smoker

6127.639 --> 6130.32
rights party that's how I think it

6128.96 --> 6134.119
should

6130.32 --> 6135.759999999999
be yeah that's right elisi smoke outside

6134.119 --> 6138.679
if you have that option right I mean if

6135.76 --> 6141.159000000001
you're like in a flat apartment like for

6138.679 --> 6144.4
me smoking like on the balcony is a

6141.159 --> 6148.839999999999
disaster at times because the wind and

6144.4 --> 6148.839999999999
the rain it just makes it it makes it

6149.679 --> 6154.56
suck so you can't

6152.32 --> 6158.239
just you yeah you can have an

6154.56 --> 6163.599
alternative to that like hey build

6158.239 --> 6166.638999999999
a a little like little room that's like

6163.599 --> 6169.400000000001
outside or half outside in which you can

6166.639 --> 6172.119
then smoke and be protected Against the

6169.4 --> 6173.638999999999
Wind and all that that kind of

6172.119 --> 6176.639
thing

6173.639 --> 6178.88
right and dude if that is like more

6176.639 --> 6182.76
standardized and like because of smoker

6178.88 --> 6184.679
rights party then industry could even

6182.76 --> 6189.4400000000005
literally accommodate for it and it's

6184.679 --> 6192.599
like yeah we build and sell standardized

6189.44 --> 6194.96
smoking rooms that you can like install

6192.599 --> 6196.4800000000005
on your balcony they are like Wind and

6194.96 --> 6199.04
Rain

6196.48 --> 6202.5199999999995
safe standardized like oh you're a

6199.04 --> 6204.32
smoker dude you can buy a smoker's

6202.52 --> 6208.080000000001
cabinet

6204.32 --> 6211.719
for like one two or four

6208.08 --> 6217.36
people for your balcony on these sizes

6211.719 --> 6220.56
from uh 200 to 500 a piece industrially

6217.36 --> 6225.159
standardized you can do that then as

6220.56 --> 6225.159000000001
soon as you just make it a

6225.96 --> 6231.199
thing

6227.56 --> 6234.599
yeah and people would do that they would

6231.199 --> 6237.159
buy that and they would greatly enjoy

6234.599 --> 6240.92
the benefits of

6237.159 --> 6244.799999999999
that would you not agree they

6240.92 --> 6247.0
would it would keep things clean inside

6244.8 --> 6247.0
the

6247.96 --> 6251.52
house it would be

6255.679 --> 6260.4
great I mean it would be fantastic if

6258.119 --> 6265.598999999999
there was like an industry that just

6260.4 --> 6268.638999999999
like yeah make standard little cabinets

6265.599 --> 6268.639
which would be like mostly

6269.119 --> 6275.119
transparent that you can easily install

6272.239 --> 6277.839999999999
on a balcony on a typical

6275.119 --> 6280.4
balcony that would be

6277.84 --> 6284.159000000001
fantastic you could make it industrial

6280.4 --> 6287.32
like really easy to install little

6284.159 --> 6290.799999999999
outside smoking rooms that protect you

6287.32 --> 6294.239
from Wind and Rain fantastic that's a

6290.8 --> 6296.88
great idea and the more you worked it

6294.239 --> 6299.239
out the cheaper it could be made and

6296.88 --> 6301.28
then just like oh just order it and they

6299.239 --> 6304.159
install it for you there you go you

6301.28 --> 6306.36
moved into a new apartment and you got a

6304.159 --> 6310.879999999999
little Smoker's room there I mean that's

6306.36 --> 6315.96
a great idea it is a great

6310.88 --> 6315.96
idea it should be it should be

6321.96 --> 6326.4
there

6323.76 --> 6326.400000000001
what what's

6327.96 --> 6335.119
[Music]

6331.159 --> 6338.119
that meditation to stop smoking oh

6335.119 --> 6338.119
okay

6338.32 --> 6341.599
whatever that's

6342.8 --> 6347.96
cute well for women I definitely do

6351.92 --> 6354.92
agree

6355.239 --> 6359.159
same at my grandma's house

6369.159 --> 6376.44
right yeah Rich G I mean yes smoking

6373.239 --> 6379.638999999999
inhouse is kind of gross I totally agree

6376.44 --> 6384.598999999999
with that that's why I'm saying all

6379.639 --> 6387.1990000000005
these things should be accounted for I'm

6384.599 --> 6390.0
literally thinking

6387.199 --> 6392.638999999999
development the smoker parties isn't

6390.0 --> 6394.96
just like

6392.639 --> 6398.4800000000005
regressive it's

6394.96 --> 6403.32
Progressive Progressive with Progressive

6398.48 --> 6406.159
isn't cut it out like destroy it like

6403.32 --> 6410.92
erase it from the past and like that's

6406.159 --> 6414.28
Nobody Does that anymore yeah that's not

6410.92 --> 6416.36
Progressive that's regressive

6414.28 --> 6419.04
and saying like oh I just won it

6416.36 --> 6421.04
completely back to like 200 years ago

6419.04 --> 6422.84
and everybody just smoke everywhere and

6421.04 --> 6424.84
like all restaurants everybody you want

6422.84 --> 6427.0
to smoke you smoke smoke in front of

6424.84 --> 6430.159000000001
kids smoke everywhere like no I don't

6427.0 --> 6433.92
want that either yeah there is issues

6430.159 --> 6433.92
with that I don't want

6434.4 --> 6439.759999999999
that real

6436.76 --> 6439.76
Progressive

6441.4 --> 6448.679
Solutions gifts smokers rights don't

6445.639 --> 6452.56
keep attacking them and find proper

6448.679 --> 6455.679
Solutions and refine those proper

6452.56 --> 6460.400000000001
Solutions industry can play into

6455.679 --> 6460.4
it everybody would be better for

6467.4 --> 6471.239
it you smoke

6471.84 --> 6477.400000000001
hot.

6474.719 --> 6477.4
Is that real

6482.08 --> 6487.679
LG all right so that's my

6484.639 --> 6489.88
idea about it

6487.679 --> 6492.32
so been

6489.88 --> 6494.679
talking one and a half hour about it

6492.32 --> 6498.08
already but I mean it's pretty serious

6494.679 --> 6500.4
like I'm I'm sick of it the taxation is

6498.08 --> 6504.0
just out of control and they're making

6500.4 --> 6507.36
it way worse it's so evil

6504.0 --> 6509.719
and it's not helping anybody's Health

6507.36 --> 6511.799999999999
like you could literally like make it

6509.719 --> 6514.719
permanently illegal you can't buy

6511.8 --> 6516.639
tobacco anywhere anymore you really

6514.719 --> 6518.36
think that the overall diseases are

6516.639 --> 6521.599
going to go down because of

6518.36 --> 6524.5599999999995
that no they

6521.599 --> 6526.96
won't

6524.56 --> 6530.360000000001
barely there's still like it's not going

6526.96 --> 6532.88
to like take away those diseases those

6530.36 --> 6536.199
diseases don't just come from smoking

6532.88 --> 6538.96
yeah it's a smoking might make it not

6536.199 --> 6540.919999999999
better for people that have certain

6538.96 --> 6543.639
conditions because of how they live what

6540.92 --> 6546.119
they ate what medical procedures they've

6543.639 --> 6551.08
undergone

6546.119 --> 6555.04
right it but the point is is that those

6551.08 --> 6559.08
conditions are not to be exclusively

6555.04 --> 6563.639
blamed on the smoking of tobacco and it

6559.08 --> 6570.4
needs to stop the scapegoating on

6563.639 --> 6570.400000000001
Tobacco needs to stop it needs to

6571.119 --> 6574.759999999999
stop I'm sick of

6584.56 --> 6591.56
it smoker rights

6587.119 --> 6593.4
party and yeah I putting the idea right

6591.56 --> 6594.52
here right now

6593.4 --> 6598.28
and we'll

6594.52 --> 6598.280000000001
see what happens with

6600.44 --> 6604.839999999999
it but I'm I am quite serious about it

6603.44 --> 6608.799999999999
and I don't know

6604.84 --> 6612.28
maybe just oh another crazy flat earther

6608.8 --> 6614.320000000001
idea all this crazy flat earthers oh

6612.28 --> 6617.199
they want everybody to smoke no I don't

6614.32 --> 6619.759999999999
want everybody to

6617.199 --> 6621.799999999999
smoke and if you actually listen to what

6619.76 --> 6625.280000000001
I talked about here on the show then you

6621.8 --> 6628.2390000000005
know that's not what I was doing I want

6625.28 --> 6632.44
a reasonable

6628.239 --> 6634.239
solution but this regressive approach

6632.44 --> 6637.5599999999995
needs to

6634.239 --> 6639.159
stop can't just make it illegal like

6637.56 --> 6640.96
that's what they want they want to just

6639.159 --> 6642.719
push it so far that it eventually

6640.96 --> 6645.2390000000005
becomes illegal that's what they're

6642.719 --> 6648.84
trying it's not helping

6645.239 --> 6652.638999999999
anything and it's not helping

6648.84 --> 6655.079
anybody yeah and the social shame also

6652.639 --> 6655.079
needs to

6658.48 --> 6664.04
stop I don't want little kids to be

6661.44 --> 6666.239
burdened by smoke I don't want kids to

6664.04 --> 6670.4
think it's popular the

6666.239 --> 6674.04
smoke but the attacking on

6670.4 --> 6678.879999999999
smokers needs to stop and the financial

6674.04 --> 6678.88
burdening of the products needs to

6679.719 --> 6687.639
stop make accountants for them there are

6683.76 --> 6692.320000000001
smokers they have a mini

6687.639 --> 6695.0
culture respect the mini culture smokers

6692.32 --> 6697.759999999999
talk with one another because they're

6695.0 --> 6701.56
smokers I've enjoyed that a great deal

6697.76 --> 6704.320000000001
in my life it's been part of my social

6701.56 --> 6706.280000000001
life in a stage where I had a lot of

6704.32 --> 6708.5599999999995
trouble even like contacting other

6706.28 --> 6710.159
people but I would always be able to

6708.56 --> 6713.280000000001
talk with other

6710.159 --> 6717.5599999999995
smokers I needed that

6713.28 --> 6721.0
I needed that for my Social

6717.56 --> 6723.119000000001
Development and the way things are now

6721.0 --> 6726.4
other people that might need that are

6723.119 --> 6726.4
being robbed of those

6730.119 --> 6738.079
opportunities and it needs to stop yeah

6733.4 --> 6740.679
I want smokers to be able to smoke again

6738.079 --> 6744.239
not everywhere in everybody's

6740.679 --> 6748.76
face but uh just stop being shamed about

6744.239 --> 6750.879999999999
it and have accountant for it have a

6748.76 --> 6754.56
separate room in the building with

6750.88 --> 6757.96
ventilation specifically for them or a a

6754.56 --> 6762.8
special space outside on the balcony for

6757.96 --> 6764.44
them industrial little yeah smoker rooms

6762.8 --> 6768.2390000000005
that could easily be installed on a

6764.44 --> 6770.678999999999
balcony for example there's all kinds of

6768.239 --> 6773.959999999999
industrial

6770.679 --> 6777.32
solutions to the problem of

6773.96 --> 6780.84
smokers burdening

6777.32 --> 6782.96
nonsmokers but don't just lay it all on

6780.84 --> 6788.2390000000005
the smokers don't just make their lives

6782.96 --> 6788.2390000000005
miserable it's unfair it's not

6797.44 --> 6802.759999999999
fair well Richard yeah that's your

6799.679 --> 6805.8
prerogative I mean it's up to you I how

6802.76 --> 6809.280000000001
you want to deal with

6805.8 --> 6812.8
that I mean it's up to the parents

6809.28 --> 6816.96
technically but I do agree that like

6812.8 --> 6821.0
little kids especially like younger than

6816.96 --> 6823.599
12 it's not good for them to be around

6821.0 --> 6827.679
smokers on a regular

6823.599 --> 6829.32
basis like having to sit in a room

6827.679 --> 6831.4400000000005
that's filled with tobacco smoke it's

6829.32 --> 6835.5599999999995
not good

6831.44 --> 6837.119
like they'll be more easily addicted

6835.56 --> 6840.8
later in

6837.119 --> 6842.36
life and if it's bad enough that they're

6840.8 --> 6846.360000000001
like coughing over it then it may

6842.36 --> 6850.199
actually result in damage physical

6846.36 --> 6854.199
damage so like I do not like smoking

6850.199 --> 6854.199
around kids you

6857.88 --> 6863.400000000001
shouldn't is it only good for

6861.36 --> 6865.199
adults

6863.4 --> 6867.5599999999995
what are you talking about good for I'm

6865.199 --> 6870.4
not talking about good or bad I'm

6867.56 --> 6870.400000000001
talking about

6872.48 --> 6875.48
rights

6875.92 --> 6882.96
yeah I'm talking about the right to do

6879.96 --> 6882.96
it

6887.28 --> 6892.88
yeah is drinking alcohol good for

6891.32 --> 6895.799999999999
you

6892.88 --> 6895.8
is that good for

6902.76 --> 6909.400000000001
you why not near

6906.4 --> 6909.4
kids

6909.52 --> 6914.92
because the kids are in their growth

6912.32 --> 6918.679
they're growing physically

6914.92 --> 6921.4400000000005
growing and they need fresh

6918.679 --> 6924.32
air in general they need fresh air they

6921.44 --> 6924.32
need clean air

6924.639 --> 6933.4800000000005
and so yeah not near

6929.44 --> 6934.5599999999995
kids I don't want to normalize that

6933.48 --> 6938.079
that's

6934.56 --> 6941.1990000000005
it not saying forbid it I'm just saying

6938.079 --> 6943.84
it shouldn't be like that when I was a

6941.199 --> 6945.638999999999
kid I didn't want it I didn't want my

6943.84 --> 6949.96
parents to smoke in the

6945.639 --> 6949.96
house I didn't want it

6951.239 --> 6954.239
personally

6954.599 --> 6963.28
like I'm smoking and I don't smoke inh

6960.32 --> 6965.079
house I don't think you should I think

6963.28 --> 6967.719
people should smoke

6965.079 --> 6969.84
outside but hey if the weather just

6967.719 --> 6974.44
makes that impossible then there should

6969.84 --> 6978.0
be easy industrially available systems

6974.44 --> 6980.199
to make that easily possible by having

6978.0 --> 6981.76
standardized little smoking cabinets

6980.199 --> 6983.44
that you can easily install on any

6981.76 --> 6986.8
balcony

6983.44 --> 6989.5199999999995
to solve that issue and help people to

6986.8 --> 6991.320000000001
not be forced to smoke inside because

6989.52 --> 6996.079000000001
outside just

6991.32 --> 6996.079
can that kind of thing that's

6997.52 --> 7001.599
it

6999.679 --> 7005.52
accommodate

7001.599 --> 7008.04
don't forbid that's that's pretty much

7005.52 --> 7012.599
it that's that's the

7008.04 --> 7015.96
overall motto the smoker's right party a

7012.599 --> 7015.96
accommodate don't

7021.8 --> 7024.8
forbid

7030.06 --> 7033.079000000001
[Music]

7036.56 --> 7040.469
[Music]

7041.159 --> 7044.159
right

7044.25 --> 7047.739
[Music]

7054.239 --> 7056.759999999999
so

7060.0 --> 7068.4
yeah we'll see where it goes with

7064.4 --> 7070.839999999999
this to make the idea more

7068.4 --> 7072.719
properly connected I might have to like

7070.84 --> 7075.28
take the Flat Earth out of

7072.719 --> 7078.96
it although I bet there's plenty of

7075.28 --> 7083.28
smokers out there that are flat

7078.96 --> 7085.32
earthers why because well if you are

7083.28 --> 7087.8
still a smoker despite all the pressure

7085.32 --> 7090.04
and all the [ __ ] that's happened you'll

7087.8 --> 7092.92
probably be tough enough to have looked

7090.04 --> 7096.119
into Flat Earth and even realized like

7092.92 --> 7099.679
yeah yeah there's something to that

7096.119 --> 7102.159
so I bet that the on

7099.679 --> 7104.88
average there's more smokers to be found

7102.159 --> 7108.04
found among flat earthers

7104.88 --> 7109.92
now simply because of the synchronicity

7108.04 --> 7111.599
because smokers have been under attack

7109.92 --> 7114.92
because flat earthers have always been

7111.599 --> 7118.719
under attack and so they just happen to

7114.92 --> 7118.719
find themselves on the same

7119.8 --> 7124.719
frequency it seems logical not saying

7122.96 --> 7127.719
that all flat earthers are smokers of

7124.719 --> 7127.719
course definitely

7131.04 --> 7134.04
not

7134.199 --> 7139.44
but I mean yeah I I really stand behind

7137.04 --> 7143.28
this idea I really do I

7139.44 --> 7144.919999999999
think something should be done to stop

7143.28 --> 7147.639
this

7144.92 --> 7150.56
Annihilation directive against smokers

7147.639 --> 7154.1990000000005
it needs to stop the psychological

7150.56 --> 7158.1990000000005
attacks need to stop the taxation needs

7154.199 --> 7160.719
to stop the peer pressure like the

7158.199 --> 7163.799999999999
Marxist style

7160.719 --> 7167.96
indoctrination to peer pressure against

7163.8 --> 7170.4400000000005
smokers should stop it needs to

7167.96 --> 7174.119
stop but at the same

7170.44 --> 7174.119
time also

7174.239 --> 7180.48
reasonable a reasonable setup should

7178.48 --> 7183.638999999999
be

7180.48 --> 7186.759999999999
considered like we don't just want

7183.639 --> 7188.52
smoking to become fully accepted

7186.76 --> 7190.04
everywhere again like every restaurant

7188.52 --> 7192.320000000001
you're going to walk into you're going

7190.04 --> 7194.5199999999995
to smell tobacco like no I don't want

7192.32 --> 7194.5199999999995
that

7196.48 --> 7201.799999999999
either I don't want

7199.28 --> 7205.28
renormalization of tobacco smoking fully

7201.8 --> 7207.92
I don't want that either they reasonable

7205.28 --> 7209.679
in between solution we were there for a

7207.92 --> 7214.36
while it was there there was a

7209.679 --> 7218.32
reasonable solution smoker rooms

7214.36 --> 7221.159
in yeah in discos and all that in

7218.32 --> 7223.639
restaurants separated with ventilation

7221.159 --> 7226.119
that was a great

7223.639 --> 7229.159000000001
solution and then they just got rid of

7226.119 --> 7232.4
all of it

7229.159 --> 7235.5199999999995
why why why didn't you just keep it like

7232.4 --> 7235.5199999999995
that it was a great

7236.719 --> 7243.44
solution but no it had to all go oh no

7240.159 --> 7246.0
it has to go you're smoker you're

7243.44 --> 7248.079
Evo you're so

7246.0 --> 7253.159
evil

7248.079 --> 7255.44
ridiculous it's just this insane Marx

7253.159 --> 7257.679
fanaticism just couldn't help itself

7255.44 --> 7260.159
like demons they just had to fully

7257.679 --> 7261.84
destroy it it's like they just keep

7260.159 --> 7265.239
pushing it because they just can't

7261.84 --> 7267.04
tolerate an alternative to exist at all

7265.239 --> 7271.079
in any

7267.04 --> 7273.079
way they only want their view of the

7271.079 --> 7274.28
world to exist and everything else has

7273.079 --> 7277.079
to be

7274.28 --> 7279.28
destroyed no middle ground and this is

7277.079 --> 7283.679
it has to stop this sickness this

7279.28 --> 7285.48
Marxist sickness which has pushed the

7283.679 --> 7289.04
anti-smokers

7285.48 --> 7289.04
movement it has to

7289.92 --> 7296.079
stop right so in that sense smoker

7292.76 --> 7297.96
rights parties smoker rights party

7296.079 --> 7301.84
against

7297.96 --> 7301.84
Marxism maybe I should add

7308.8 --> 7313.84
that

7310.84 --> 7313.84
yeah

7322.56 --> 7326.320000000001
there you go now it's

7329.44 --> 7333.919999999999
complete right hope you have all been

7331.4 --> 7333.92
enjoying the

7334.92 --> 7340.84
show not ending just yet but I'd

7337.639 --> 7343.84
appreciate if you Rogan it up

7340.84 --> 7343.84
already

7345.119 --> 7351.5199999999995
oh I've got some already nice

7348.56 --> 7354.52
eight 29

7351.52 --> 7356.320000000001
watching

7354.52 --> 7357.76
great it's been an interesting

7356.32 --> 7358.96
conversation not the first time I'm

7357.76 --> 7362.2390000000005
having this

7358.96 --> 7364.28
though but this is is this like the

7362.239 --> 7365.44
third or fourth time that I brought up

7364.28 --> 7368.84
this

7365.44 --> 7371.4
subject cuz it is like it's genuinely a

7368.84 --> 7373.0
thing and I think it's really it is

7371.4 --> 7375.32
important it's

7373.0 --> 7378.36
important to

7375.32 --> 7382.239
spare the subculture the micro culture

7378.36 --> 7382.239
it is a culture that has its

7383.52 --> 7391.599
value yeah smoking is not just only bad

7387.92 --> 7394.52
it just isn't I think there's a lot of

7391.599 --> 7395.96
misinformation about smoking and

7394.52 --> 7398.320000000001
statistical

7395.96 --> 7401.199
fraud I really

7398.32 --> 7404.119
do to mislead people into thinking

7401.199 --> 7406.96
smoking is always and exclusively bad

7404.119 --> 7411.759999999999
and it's always there to be evil

7406.96 --> 7415.04
nonsense yeah nonsense from people those

7411.76 --> 7419.400000000001
same groups the same Marxist groups that

7415.04 --> 7421.679
do that they're always so concerned with

7419.4 --> 7424.558999999999
overpopulation oh yeah oh yeah but they

7421.679 --> 7424.559
hate smoking

7428.639 --> 7435.599
oh seems a little fishy doesn't it

7432.32 --> 7438.0
yeah smoking is bad it gets you killed

7435.599 --> 7440.679
oh it's so terrible oh oh but oh but we

7438.0 --> 7443.0
got an overpopulation problem now oh

7440.679 --> 7447.4
we're so burdensome on Mother Earth and

7443.0 --> 7449.599
oh oh yes oh yeah oh but smokers is oh

7447.4 --> 7451.5199999999995
that's the real problem that's all

7449.599 --> 7453.88
deadly but on the other hand oh yeah

7451.52 --> 7456.88
population control we need to reduce

7453.88 --> 7459.36
reproduction and

7456.88 --> 7462.2390000000005
population that doesn't really match

7459.36 --> 7464.92
does it it doesn't match

7462.239 --> 7468.839999999999
it's

7464.92 --> 7471.159
contradicting you should be by that

7468.84 --> 7475.04
gross contradiction of the same group

7471.159 --> 7478.638999999999
pushing those things you should be very

7475.04 --> 7481.639
suspicious about what has been said and

7478.639 --> 7485.400000000001
claimed about tobacco smoke you should

7481.639 --> 7485.400000000001
be very suspicious about

7485.639 --> 7493.92
it yeah I'm not making any medical

7489.0 --> 7496.559
claims I'm just saying the contract is

7493.92 --> 7501.639
jarring and you should be suspicious

7496.559 --> 7503.0
about it you should do careful research

7501.639 --> 7506.04
and be

7503.0 --> 7507.96
skeptic be skeptical about what you're

7506.04 --> 7509.8
bumping into don't draw quick

7507.96 --> 7512.28
conclusions and definitely don't be

7509.8 --> 7514.92
swept away by some group- based peer

7512.28 --> 7514.92
pressure about

7515.8 --> 7520.639
it have to figure it out yourself might

7518.8 --> 7524.4400000000005
learn a whole bunch of interesting

7520.639 --> 7528.36
things along the

7524.44 --> 7531.079
way and then when you do you'd

7528.36 --> 7535.0
probably think that yeah the smoker

7531.079 --> 7537.4
rights parties may be a very very good

7535.0 --> 7539.639
idea not because you want everybody to

7537.4 --> 7542.239
smoke but

7539.639 --> 7545.32
because they should have a right to

7542.239 --> 7548.638999999999
exist and be left alone and not be taxed

7545.32 --> 7549.44
out of existence and peer pressured out

7548.639 --> 7551.679
of

7549.44 --> 7555.04
existence and shamed out of exist

7551.679 --> 7557.719
existence and psychologically attacked

7555.04 --> 7557.719
with medical

7561.079 --> 7568.079
claims and that's really all I

7563.84 --> 7568.079
wanted to bring forth with this

7568.159 --> 7574.879999999999
subject and yeah if if you

7571.719 --> 7576.84
agree then contact me about it like

7574.88 --> 7580.04
leave a leave a

7576.84 --> 7582.76
comment or if you're like hey I really I

7580.04 --> 7585.28
actually think this is a fantastic

7582.76 --> 7587.92
maybe we could like create a party about

7585.28 --> 7590.0
this or I I already know like 20 people

7587.92 --> 7592.76
that have that are like already thinking

7590.0 --> 7594.719
like this would you like to connect up

7592.76 --> 7597.76
or would you like to be a speaker hey I

7594.719 --> 7600.04
can be a speaker I am a speaker I can do

7597.76 --> 7602.04
all of this conversation that I've done

7600.04 --> 7606.32
here on this show I can do it in Dutch

7602.04 --> 7607.84
too because logically I'm Dutch so if

7606.32 --> 7611.079
there's going to be a smoker rights

7607.84 --> 7613.719
party it's going to be Dutch I can do

7611.079 --> 7616.28
all of this talk everything I've said I

7613.719 --> 7618.76
can do in Dutch as well so seriously

7616.28 --> 7618.759999999999
contact

7620.0 --> 7627.96
me right and uh if you think like the

7624.639 --> 7631.4800000000005
Flat Earth thing we don't really want

7627.96 --> 7632.8
that I get it I'm not going to push my

7631.48 --> 7636.4
flat

7632.8 --> 7639.679
Earth on such a specific

7636.4 --> 7641.759999999999
political activity so don't worry about

7639.679 --> 7644.559
that part I'll leave the Flat Earth out

7641.76 --> 7646.599
of it if you all think that that's much

7644.559 --> 7649.159000000001
better definitely not going to push it

7646.599 --> 7653.4800000000005
on anybody I mean I'm not going to like

7649.159 --> 7657.079
start spouting Globe rhetoric yeah don't

7653.48 --> 7659.879999999999
definitely don't expect me to do that

7657.079 --> 7663.079
but I mean not everything everywhere I

7659.88 --> 7664.76
go I have I don't have to like tell the

7663.079 --> 7667.0
everybody the Earth is flat all the time

7664.76 --> 7669.92
I'm not like

7667.0 --> 7672.52
that I just know the Earth is flat

7669.92 --> 7674.1990000000005
and that's that

7672.52 --> 7678.1990000000005
but that's not the only

7674.199 --> 7681.558999999999
thing that's going on in the world you

7678.199 --> 7683.919999999999
know right so

7681.559 --> 7686.8
anyway don't know

7683.92 --> 7688.52
why nobody's talking for 15 minutes

7686.8 --> 7692.4800000000005
straight where the hell are you all at

7688.52 --> 7692.4800000000005
all of a sudden where did everybody

7700.44 --> 7703.44
go

7726.76 --> 7733.4400000000005
hello playing checkers while listening

7729.119 --> 7733.44
to the stream okay

7734.28 --> 7736.639
fair

7740.159 --> 7743.159
enough

7752.32 --> 7756.759999999999
yeah yeah no I'm not doing that

7760.36 --> 7763.36
though

7770.76 --> 7776.599
right but I mean even like another

7773.119 --> 7780.839999999999
idea about the smoker rights party it

7776.599 --> 7783.679
should also like really address the

7780.84 --> 7786.4400000000005
industry because I think that there are

7783.679 --> 7788.52
things wrong with big tobacco industry

7786.44 --> 7792.0
you

7788.52 --> 7795.92
see there's a lot of stuff they do that

7792.0 --> 7799.48
I do suspect and make no official claims

7795.92 --> 7804.92
at this point are actually contributing

7799.48 --> 7804.919999999999
to the negative Health consequences of

7806.28 --> 7813.159
smoking I think that smoking should

7810.88 --> 7815.92
be as an

7813.159 --> 7819.5199999999995
industry

7815.92 --> 7823.4400000000005
revitalized to make smoking products

7819.52 --> 7826.92
less damaging and not by oh just like

7823.44 --> 7829.199
lighten it up or like all the not in the

7826.92 --> 7831.32
traditional sense as like how they like

7829.199 --> 7834.678999999999
to chemically

7831.32 --> 7837.759999999999
metal right not like that but rather

7834.679 --> 7842.36
like well if you're going to make some

7837.76 --> 7843.84
issues about it then maybe mandate that

7842.36 --> 7846.04
tobacco should be

7843.84 --> 7849.360000000001
organic

7846.04 --> 7852.679
right just like no

7849.36 --> 7856.159
more pollutions no more chemical

7852.679 --> 7859.52
additives like really transform the

7856.159 --> 7861.839999999999
industry instead of forbidding it make

7859.52 --> 7864.639
it

7861.84 --> 7869.400000000001
better make it even less about

7864.639 --> 7872.88
convenience and more about better for

7869.4 --> 7875.598999999999
health right because a lot of like smoke

7872.88 --> 7877.4400000000005
cigarette de Industrial Development has

7875.599 --> 7879.119000000001
been like oh how do we make a cigarette

7877.44 --> 7881.558999999999
that never goes out once you light it up

7879.119 --> 7883.639
it will just always keep going and then

7881.559 --> 7886.360000000001
for convenience everything for

7883.639 --> 7889.0
convenience right that's that's how big

7886.36 --> 7891.759999999999
tobacco has developed itself to be just

7889.0 --> 7896.639
like just like the fast

7891.76 --> 7901.679
food style Industries like super easy

7896.639 --> 7904.559
convenience well that has to

7901.679 --> 7906.639
stop that's where I would draw the line

7904.559 --> 7909.92
and then the smokers rights party would

7906.639 --> 7912.559
say like yeah you can't do that anymore

7909.92 --> 7914.4400000000005
like you're not allowed to use these

7912.559 --> 7916.52
chemicals

7914.44 --> 7921.638999999999
ever you need

7916.52 --> 7926.400000000001
to use more raw Leaf based

7921.639 --> 7929.4800000000005
products you can't make these convenient

7926.4 --> 7932.96
Industrial Products like that that are

7929.48 --> 7936.32
actually provably bad and you need to do

7932.96 --> 7939.44
it differently and then reform the

7936.32 --> 7943.119
industry and just like the food industry

7939.44 --> 7947.32
has been reformed through the organic

7943.119 --> 7951.239
system right organic food like that was

7947.32 --> 7953.88
a transformation of the food industry or

7951.239 --> 7957.44
a fall back to original ways of doing

7953.88 --> 7962.52
things you could say that well how about

7957.44 --> 7962.5199999999995
an organic Revolution like that with

7962.679 --> 7972.36
tobacco I'm serious like make

7967.04 --> 7974.679
tobacco great again make it not so easy

7972.36 --> 7978.0
and toxic and like weird chemicals like

7974.679 --> 7981.0
no more not allowed no more secret

7978.0 --> 7981.0
chemicals no more

7984.36 --> 7988.159
secrets I'm all for

7992.36 --> 7999.639
that so that it can just

7995.84 --> 8001.32
be not super easy convenient and oh you

7999.639 --> 8004.28
don't have to think about it not a

8001.32 --> 8007.679
product for idiots and lazy

8004.28 --> 8009.36
people and people that that very easily

8007.679 --> 8013.1990000000005
allow themselves to get addicted and

8009.36 --> 8017.4
then never get off it not for that easy

8013.199 --> 8021.199
Undead type of customer but just for the

8017.4 --> 8024.839999999999
genuine smoker who who really enjoys it

8021.199 --> 8026.638999999999
uses it spiritually uses it socially and

8024.84 --> 8031.559
is concerned about their

8026.639 --> 8033.76
health and like reform the industry

8031.559 --> 8035.96
so that basically the old form of big

8033.76 --> 8040.1990000000005
tobacco gets out of the picture like get

8035.96 --> 8044.0
the [ __ ] out you're all fired you get

8040.199 --> 8047.598999999999
the hell out no more industrial [ __ ]

8044.0 --> 8048.639
with your secret little sauces and crap

8047.599 --> 8051.84
like

8048.639 --> 8054.1990000000005
forbidden I would actually forbid that

8051.84 --> 8055.079
as the smoker rights party forbid it

8054.199 --> 8058.839999999999
like

8055.079 --> 8063.759999999999
illegal not taxed illegal you're out of

8058.84 --> 8067.719
here and go back to a more raw product

8063.76 --> 8070.1990000000005
form of tobacco products raw more

8067.719 --> 8073.639
raw no more secret

8070.199 --> 8075.919999999999
ingredients no more oh we developed it

8073.639 --> 8077.159000000001
to be super convenient and addictive get

8075.92 --> 8082.119
the [ __ ]

8077.159 --> 8085.719
out illegal make it more raw and then

8082.119 --> 8088.5199999999995
lower the overall health damages and

8085.719 --> 8091.04
risks that are tied in with tobacco

8088.52 --> 8093.400000000001
products because of big tobacco and all

8091.04 --> 8096.28
all their secret

8093.4 --> 8099.48
[Music]

8096.28 --> 8101.84
sauces okay man go yeah it's on your

8099.48 --> 8101.839999999999
side

8103.159 --> 8107.32
though just have to refresh like that

8105.96 --> 8111.96
would be my

8107.32 --> 8115.04
idea to just get raw leaves and like get

8111.96 --> 8116.96
back to a more basic form of

8115.04 --> 8119.88
product and

8116.96 --> 8123.639
then yeah things could just be better

8119.88 --> 8125.88
more like how they originally started

8123.639 --> 8128.76
out import the

8125.88 --> 8130.4400000000005
leaves and then well it kind of like

8128.76 --> 8132.2390000000005
what they did back then like oh you roll

8130.44 --> 8134.96
it you make the cigars you make the

8132.239 --> 8137.638999999999
cigars at home and then you have like oh

8134.96 --> 8141.119
good oldfashioned tobacco in a tobacco

8137.639 --> 8144.559
store right

8141.119 --> 8147.96
handcrafted that would be great it would

8144.559 --> 8151.52
be fantastic no more secret sauces no

8147.96 --> 8153.4
more quick quick dirty filter is all

8151.52 --> 8156.96
that

8153.4 --> 8159.48
crap but like

8156.96 --> 8163.719
more

8159.48 --> 8163.718999999999
uh hold on that's the right word for

8165.49 --> 8170.92
[Music]

8168.52 --> 8173.8
that more

8170.92 --> 8177.079
Artis yeah it's the right

8173.8 --> 8179.52
apparently in Dutch but more

8177.079 --> 8183.119
Artis based

8179.52 --> 8187.2390000000005
tobacco more handcrafted stuff no more

8183.119 --> 8189.5199999999995
secret sauces more focused on like high

8187.239 --> 8192.519
clean organic

8189.52 --> 8196.0
qualities to really change around the

8192.519 --> 8199.08
smoking industry and get rid of like

8196.0 --> 8201.92
evil obviously evil and not trustworthy

8199.08 --> 8204.479
big tobacco that does all this weird

8201.92 --> 8204.479
secret

8205.16 --> 8212.679
[ __ ] cuz I am personally of the opinion

8209.8 --> 8217.0
that big tobacco is

8212.679 --> 8219.439
actually like evil and that they have

8217.0 --> 8221.96
worked on ruining

8219.439 --> 8223.960000000001
smoking that they were basically a

8221.96 --> 8225.639
controlled opposition In Cahoots with

8223.96 --> 8229.358999999999
the marxists that have tried to get rid

8225.639 --> 8233.08
of smoking it's big tobacco that that

8229.359 --> 8235.12
made that happen yeah before tobacco was

8233.08 --> 8237.319
big and Industrial and started to do

8235.12 --> 8240.359
weird secret

8237.319 --> 8241.679
[ __ ] there was less Health consequences

8240.359 --> 8245.639000000001
from smok

8241.679 --> 8249.479
I blame not the tobacco itself I blame

8245.639 --> 8252.679
those industries from ruining the

8249.479 --> 8254.039999999999
product and then tobacco in general gets

8252.679 --> 8256.88
the

8254.04 --> 8258.84
blame the actual plant gets the blame

8256.88 --> 8260.639
it's the industry and what they were

8258.84 --> 8262.8
doing that should get the blame for all

8260.639 --> 8262.8
of

8263.0 --> 8268.12
it that's what the smokers rights party

8265.719 --> 8268.119999999999
is all

8269.84 --> 8272.84
about

8273.359 --> 8278.679
all right so you go play

8275.679 --> 8278.679
B

8295.359 --> 8302.479000000001
whatever right so there's that

8298.84 --> 8305.16
again another R WI

8302.479 --> 8306.88
subject but I mean I really mean it I I

8305.16 --> 8308.519
wouldn't be talking for two hours

8306.88 --> 8310.518999999998
straight about it if I didn't really

8308.519 --> 8315.0
mean

8310.519 --> 8315.0
it I am passionate about this

8318.12 --> 8324.800000000001
subject didn't tobacco industry pay off

8320.8 --> 8324.8
doctors in the USA to yeah they

8327.479 --> 8335.8

8348.359 --> 8352.800000000001
handroll

8349.92 --> 8355.399
cigars make them oldfashioned just like

8352.8 --> 8357.16
200 years ago a recipe I learned from my

8355.399 --> 8359.439
great great grandfather Yeah those

8357.16 --> 8362.88
people weren't paying

8359.439 --> 8366.599
doctors to claim it was good it was the

8362.88 --> 8369.0
big greedy sick big tobacco industry

8366.599 --> 8372.28
that did all those things they were

8369.0 --> 8375.92
doing evil things they were trying to

8372.28 --> 8378.28
normalize standardized cigarettes yeah

8375.92 --> 8380.16
with the dirty filters and and whatever

8378.28 --> 8384.24
sauce they put in that

8380.16 --> 8387.68
crap it's big industrial

8384.24 --> 8390.24
tobacco not just tobacco

8387.68 --> 8392.64
Farmers they didn't have anything to do

8390.24 --> 8392.64
with that

8395.2 --> 8401.6
it's The Big Industry the big Mega

8397.52 --> 8404.76
Industries greedy greedy selfish

8401.6 --> 8407.52
bastards that that did all that that has

8404.76 --> 8407.52
caused the

8414.08 --> 8418.0
Damage Big Business always prefers

8416.319 --> 8422.64
everything yeah and it should end they

8418.0 --> 8426.2
should be made illegal shut

8422.64 --> 8429.84
down shut down and like take all the

8426.2 --> 8434.28
profits and actually like insert it

8429.84 --> 8436.479
into the uh the health industry arguably

8434.28 --> 8438.92
to solve the problems that they cause

8436.479 --> 8441.8
but I mean yeah big tobacco big

8438.92 --> 8444.319
industrial tobacco shut it

8441.8 --> 8448.0
down totally shut it

8444.319 --> 8452.479
down make it illegal worldwide and get

8448.0 --> 8455.479
it back to Small Time

8452.479 --> 8459.319
handcrafted tobacco products no secret

8455.479 --> 8462.119999999999
sauces like make secret sauces illegal

8459.319 --> 8464.479
you have to use the raw product if

8462.12 --> 8469.68
you're going to use ingredients then you

8464.479 --> 8472.358999999999
must be completely open about it like

8469.68 --> 8475.880000000001
[ __ ] your secret ingredients secret ing

8472.359 --> 8478.6
dude secret ingredients in any kind of

8475.88 --> 8481.679999999998
consumption product in any industry

8478.6 --> 8486.12
should be totally and permanently

8481.68 --> 8489.12
illegal secret ingredients should be

8486.12 --> 8489.12
totally

8489.16 --> 8495.28
illegal in consumption

8492.16 --> 8497.0
products in everything in food

8495.28 --> 8499.560000000001
everything everything that is consumed

8497.0 --> 8503.64
everything that is taken into the body

8499.56 --> 8507.519999999999
secret ingredients should be universally

8503.64 --> 8507.519999999999
illegal under heavy

8509.52 --> 8514.68
penalty

8511.92 --> 8517.319
Amish people were right all the way yeah

8514.68 --> 8517.319
they of course they

8523.24 --> 8527.359
are why would they get rid of their

8527.68 --> 8530.68
customers

8531.08 --> 8535.56
what they don't care about getting rid

8533.439 --> 8538.960000000001
of their customers they just care to

8535.56 --> 8540.96
make as many people addicted and

8538.96 --> 8545.199999999999
incapable of stepping away as they

8540.96 --> 8547.358999999999
possibly could it's growth quick growth

8545.2 --> 8549.16
at at all cost they didn't care if

8547.359 --> 8553.76
everybody would die because of it

8549.16 --> 8556.28
statistically if they could get a 20%

8553.76 --> 8562.359
growth

8556.28 --> 8565.6
more and a 50% kill rate more then they

8562.359 --> 8569.24
choose that 20% growth because they are

8565.6 --> 8572.28
evil greedy

8569.24 --> 8575.8
scumbags that only care about money and

8572.28 --> 8575.800000000001
not about how much damage they

8576.399 --> 8581.0
cost that's the biggest problem with all

8579.64 --> 8583.0
the mega

8581.0 --> 8585.04
Industries that's why they are Mega

8583.0 --> 8587.359
Industries it's because the bigger they

8585.04 --> 8589.04
get the less they care about the

8587.359 --> 8591.439
customers and the product quality and

8589.04 --> 8594.2
the more they're just obsessed with

8591.439 --> 8598.279
getting that extra percentage of

8594.2 --> 8599.439
profit and they'll literally kill for it

8598.279 --> 8603.319000000001
they'll

8599.439 --> 8607.720000000001
kill for that extra percentage kill for

8603.319 --> 8610.479
it knowingly get people killed for it

8607.72 --> 8610.479
and it needs to

8610.72 --> 8617.119999999999
stop big tobacco needs to

8614.16 --> 8620.359
end

8617.12 --> 8624.880000000001
completely and get very strict rules on

8620.359 --> 8628.640000000001
Tobacco consumption production

8624.88 --> 8632.24
like more handcrafted oriented no more

8628.64 --> 8635.439
secret sauces like illegal totally

8632.24 --> 8638.72
illegal like you get caught Secret Sauce

8635.439 --> 8638.720000000001
you get jail

8638.96 --> 8644.88
time that's where I think it should

8641.76 --> 8648.0
go but it must be yeah whatever you get

8644.88 --> 8651.839999999998
the point and then just make it like it

8648.0 --> 8655.319
used to be right and

8651.84 --> 8657.56
hey you could still have a factory with

8655.319 --> 8662.08
robotics and all that it's just like no

8657.56 --> 8664.8
more Secret Sauce crap that's over

8662.08 --> 8668.439
like oh we want to try a new flavor

8664.8 --> 8670.519999999999
tobacco okay that's cool with we're

8668.439 --> 8672.720000000001
going to like look at it with great

8670.52 --> 8675.359
scrutiny though yeah and you're

8672.72 --> 8678.84
definitely not just going to try out

8675.359 --> 8681.84
some weird new chemicals yeah definitely

8678.84 --> 8681.84
not

8684.68 --> 8689.279
yeah so that's that would be my

8689.319 --> 8694.519999999999
Approach right and in that sense yeah

8692.0 --> 8698.12
the smoker rights party will actually

8694.52 --> 8700.880000000001
also ironically go after big

8698.12 --> 8702.52
tobacco to get the entire situation

8700.88 --> 8706.039999999999
under

8702.52 --> 8710.399000000001
control because I am of the personal

8706.04 --> 8713.279
belief that big tobacco has created the

8710.399 --> 8717.479
problems that have led up to this

8713.279 --> 8719.439
Marxist attack on smoking culture it's

8717.479 --> 8720.84
because of big tobacco that that's

8719.439 --> 8723.800000000001
happened

8720.84 --> 8726.76
if big tobacco hadn't ruined

8723.8 --> 8729.438999999998
everything and actually made smoking

8726.76 --> 8731.72
more dangerous for People's

8729.439 --> 8733.92
Health then all of this might have been

8731.72 --> 8736.96
a veil and we would have still been just

8733.92 --> 8739.2
general smokers like in the 19th and

8736.96 --> 8741.119999999999
18th and even 17th

8739.2 --> 8743.16
century and there wouldn't be any

8741.12 --> 8745.640000000001
problem there wouldn't be any Universal

8743.16 --> 8747.439
Health crisis that never ended if people

8745.64 --> 8751.439
continually getting lung cancer and all

8747.439 --> 8753.439
that it just wouldn't be there

8751.439 --> 8755.880000000001
it's big tobacco's fault and the

8753.439 --> 8759.319
smoker's rights party is going to go

8755.88 --> 8762.16
after them if we ever if we ever make it

8759.319 --> 8762.16
if we're going to get

8762.24 --> 8769.16
big not after the hand Crafters yeah not

8766.72 --> 8773.84
after guys that are

8769.16 --> 8776.64
like 10 guys in a shop like rolling

8773.84 --> 8779.76
cigarettes manually or making cigars

8776.64 --> 8782.72
manually importing like organic quality

8779.76 --> 8785.359
raw Le leaves and doing that no those

8782.72 --> 8788.599999999999
people that's cool as long as you don't

8785.359 --> 8791.84
use any dirty secret ingredients right

8788.6 --> 8795.399000000001
but big industry and their secret sauces

8791.84 --> 8795.399
illegal shut it

8798.319 --> 8804.72
down is it harmful

8800.88 --> 8808.039999999999
now well there's ingredients in tobacco

8804.72 --> 8811.24
in in like typical

8808.04 --> 8814.12
standardized corporate tobacco that yeah

8811.24 --> 8818.119999999999
that do make smoking

8814.12 --> 8818.12
that unhealthy

8818.24 --> 8825.6
provably so there are aspects about

8821.92 --> 8829.279
tobacco products not tobacco tobacco

8825.6 --> 8832.279
products from Big Industry that are

8829.279 --> 8832.279
harmful

8832.63 --> 8835.83
[Music]

8839.16 --> 8843.84
yes

8840.84 --> 8846.479
so I think I uh made my full case here

8843.84 --> 8848.6
from every conceivable angle I think

8846.479 --> 8851.56
pretty much said anything about this

8848.6 --> 8851.56
subject that I could

8853.479 --> 8858.96
say hello Bill n s by way good see

8864.64 --> 8870.16
you disgusting pics ever on government

8868.359 --> 8875.0
yeah that's yeah that's the psycholog

8870.16 --> 8878.359
iCal Warfare aspect Rich G fear

8875.0 --> 8879.479
porn it is it is provable fear porn like

8878.359 --> 8882.0
all of those

8879.479 --> 8883.88
pictures this sounds ridiculous but I

8882.0 --> 8886.88
even learned this like 20 years ago when

8883.88 --> 8889.199999999999
they started it those pictures often

8886.88 --> 8892.759999999998
don't even have anything to do with

8889.2 --> 8895.68
smokers it's just made

8892.76 --> 8898.800000000001
up those people get

8895.68 --> 8900.68
like they just are super unhealthy often

8898.8 --> 8902.84
Drinkers and all that

8900.68 --> 8905.359
and then they get an operation and there

8902.84 --> 8908.359
is like you want like you're going to

8905.359 --> 8912.359
get a huge bill but we're going to cut

8908.359 --> 8916.720000000001
we could cut like 5,000 to 20,000 out of

8912.359 --> 8922.92
that bill if you are willing to have us

8916.72 --> 8926.399
take pictures and then use it for this

8922.92 --> 8928.84
operation of discouraging smoking like

8926.399 --> 8930.479
that's what happened that's really

8928.84 --> 8933.319
that's what happened that's where a lot

8930.479 --> 8936.08
of these pictures come from a lot of it

8933.319 --> 8938.8
literally has nothing to do with smoking

8936.08 --> 8938.8
with smokers

8938.96 --> 8945.16
allegedly I don't trust it I've heard

8942.08 --> 8948.84
that stuff like 20 years ago I can't

8945.16 --> 8952.439
prove that but I don't trust it at all

8948.84 --> 8952.439
and I think it's just psychological

8953.24 --> 8958.359
warfare right so

8955.399 --> 8962.399
there's attackers from all side and it

8958.359 --> 8963.439
needs to stop the financial attack needs

8962.399 --> 8967.599999999999
to

8963.439 --> 8971.479000000001
stop the cultural societal peer pressure

8967.6 --> 8974.52
based attacks need to stop and the fear

8971.479 --> 8977.358999999999
porn nonsense on the packages needs to

8974.52 --> 8979.76
stop it all needs to stop and it needs

8977.359 --> 8984.800000000001
to be a reasonable solution in which

8979.76 --> 8987.479
smokers have a right to be and to smoke

8984.8 --> 8991.24
but not at cost of everybody else of

8987.479 --> 8992.96
course a reasonable Middle Road

8991.24 --> 8995.399
and I discussed all of that on the show

8992.96 --> 8995.399
today

9002.1 --> 9005.299
[Music]

9018.16 --> 9023.6
so right but I mean like even those

9020.64 --> 9026.84
pictures on the tobacco [ __ ] I mean it's

9023.6 --> 9030.6
a very easy solution you just cut it you

9026.84 --> 9032.960000000001
just cut it off you just I I

9030.6 --> 9034.6
just and then there's there only half a

9032.96 --> 9037.519999999999
stupid picture but it doesn't really

9034.6 --> 9038.92
bother me it's like you just cut off the

9037.52 --> 9041.279
the

9038.92 --> 9044.16
disgusting photos whatever they put on

9041.279 --> 9044.16
it

9045.56 --> 9053.359
right what I find more disturbing is

9048.52 --> 9055.880000000001
that they had the unique brand logos and

9053.359 --> 9058.16
pictures off the tobacco packs is that

9055.88 --> 9060.88
they basically made it illegal for a

9058.16 --> 9062.72
brand to have its own color scheme and

9060.88 --> 9066.24
everything like

9062.72 --> 9069.84
that's that's just mean that they did

9066.24 --> 9071.0
that it's all this stupid brown gray

9069.84 --> 9073.08
[ __ ]

9071.0 --> 9076.16
now that's just

9073.08 --> 9078.92
mean all of it needs to stop it all

9076.16 --> 9081.119999999999
needs to

9078.92 --> 9085.279
stop

9081.12 --> 9089.640000000001
give the packages their original brand

9085.279 --> 9093.479000000001
back cut the taxes down to a maximum of

9089.64 --> 9095.76
100% in any combination never more than

9093.479 --> 9098.76
100%

9095.76 --> 9098.76
and

9099.08 --> 9105.88
allow like coffee shops

9102.399 --> 9107.278999999999
restaurants public places to have

9105.88 --> 9110.64
smokers

9107.279 --> 9113.12
again under condition that they have

9110.64 --> 9116.84
separated rooms or plenty of

9113.12 --> 9118.12
opportunity to smoke away from the rest

9116.84 --> 9120.2
of the

9118.12 --> 9122.04
nonsmokers because I don't want just

9120.2 --> 9125.0
everybody I don't want to force it on

9122.04 --> 9127.52
anybody right but just get it back to a

9125.0 --> 9127.52
reasonable

9128.359 --> 9135.16
setting raising the minimum yeah that

9130.96 --> 9135.16
has to stop too Richard like it's

9138.84 --> 9143.08
ridiculous

9140.72 --> 9145.358999999999
don't see that in booze industry yeah I

9143.08 --> 9150.319
know because

9145.359 --> 9153.84
booze is of the devil and all Mega

9150.319 --> 9157.24
corporations love booze they all love it

9153.84 --> 9161.08
why because booze makes you dumb and

9157.24 --> 9164.279
suggestible and easy to sell

9161.08 --> 9166.92
[ __ ] that's why they want everybody to

9164.279 --> 9170.439
drink oh it's bad for them all they get

9166.92 --> 9174.56
killed they get in trouble but hey it it

9170.439 --> 9176.800000000001
makes it great it makes it great because

9174.56 --> 9180.319
sell sell sell that's all they care

9176.8 --> 9183.8
about that's all they care about yeah

9180.319 --> 9187.199999999999
like give us all your money and

9183.8 --> 9190.92
die that's the mega Corporation model

9187.2 --> 9194.0
give us all your money and die so yeah

9190.92 --> 9198.72
they love boo it's all that's all fine

9194.0 --> 9200.99
right but tobacco oh my god oh so evil

9198.72 --> 9204.039999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ]

9200.99 --> 9204.039999999999
[Music]

9211.52 --> 9216.68
so yeah that's my uh smoker rights party

9214.359 --> 9220.76
against Marxism

9216.68 --> 9223.880000000001
show and uh hope you all enjoyed it hope

9220.76 --> 9226.76
it all made you think it is quite

9223.88 --> 9230.199999999999
serious none of this was a joke was

9226.76 --> 9232.0
meant as a joke or is considered in any

9230.2 --> 9233.720000000001
way a joke to me it's a very serious

9232.0 --> 9234.84
subject and that's why I spend an entire

9233.72 --> 9237.599999999999
show on

9234.84 --> 9240.279
it and I'll probably bring it back up in

9237.6 --> 9240.279
the future

9255.359 --> 9263.08
again hello Jason mcck by the way good

9258.359 --> 9263.08
see you Richard regular

9263.96 --> 9273.64
Richard Rogan's up indeed ethnic one Tom

9269.64 --> 9273.64
save Timothy kendle

9277.399 --> 9282.88
Boro lots of people in glad to see all

9280.68 --> 9282.880000000001
of

9283.52 --> 9290.6
you right and again just for the record

9287.439 --> 9292.399
of those late comers smoke rights party

9290.6 --> 9295.24
is not

9292.399 --> 9298.88
about get rid of everything and just

9295.24 --> 9302.88
like oh we want the right to be able

9298.88 --> 9305.519999999999
to smoke in and blow it in your face

9302.88 --> 9307.72
without and like without you even being

9305.52 --> 9312.12
allowed to complain about no no we don't

9307.72 --> 9316.519999999999
want to force smoking on people we do

9312.12 --> 9320.279
realize that there are like there has to

9316.52 --> 9325.24
be a protection of the nonsmoker as well

9320.279 --> 9327.359
it's just been become too much too

9325.24 --> 9331.56
one-sided

9327.359 --> 9334.319
and it turned into an erasing culture

9331.56 --> 9336.88
like they're basically trying to forbid

9334.319 --> 9339.88
smoking without making it legal and that

9336.88 --> 9339.88
is

9339.96 --> 9348.358999999999
inacceptable but big industry has to

9344.08 --> 9350.84
be basically addressed and

9348.359 --> 9354.439
changed Poss possibly gotten rid of

9350.84 --> 9359.0
entirely and make it a small scale

9354.439 --> 9361.04
operation based system again where it's

9359.0 --> 9365.08
just

9361.04 --> 9369.160000000002
people making it handmade

9365.08 --> 9372.12
stuff as much organic quality as

9369.16 --> 9374.439
possible and just make it good again

9372.12 --> 9378.08
make it wholesome

9374.439 --> 9380.399
again and not about oh sales sales sales

9378.08 --> 9383.359
sales we don't care if everybody dies

9380.399 --> 9386.76
that has to stop big tobacco [ __ ] has to

9383.359 --> 9389.640000000001
stop potentially make completely illegal

9386.76 --> 9393.6
so that product becomes less damaging to

9389.64 --> 9397.519999999999
the health of whoever uses it and good

9393.6 --> 9400.800000000001
solutions for people to be able to smoke

9397.52 --> 9404.960000000001
without automatically burdening

9400.8 --> 9406.16
nonsmokers right so that there's places

9404.96 --> 9409.759999999998
in in

9406.16 --> 9412.52
public facilities like restaurants and

9409.76 --> 9416.880000000001
discos and all that where there is a

9412.52 --> 9419.16
separate smoker room that yeah where you

9416.88 --> 9422.119999999999
can do

9419.16 --> 9424.08
that without bothering the non-smokers

9422.12 --> 9428.6
like that should be it should be and it

9424.08 --> 9429.88
should be industrialized and even like

9428.6 --> 9433.04
made for

9429.88 --> 9436.479
houses as I

9433.04 --> 9438.52
said industrial quick made compartments

9436.479 --> 9442.64
that you can install on the

9438.52 --> 9444.319000000001
balcony so that you can smoke outside

9442.64 --> 9446.96
even when it's

9444.319 --> 9449.439
storming you can just go into a little

9446.96 --> 9451.96
compartment installed there and just

9449.439 --> 9454.12
smoke outside so you don't have to like

9451.96 --> 9457.479
smoke inside because it's storming and

9454.12 --> 9461.720000000001
[ __ ] and just like make an industry for

9457.479 --> 9464.96
it yeah that's always good making an

9461.72 --> 9468.8
industry find solutions

9464.96 --> 9469.96
for we don't want to have smokers inside

9468.8 --> 9472.88
find solution

9469.96 --> 9476.039999999999
industrial Solutions keep it in there

9472.88 --> 9478.92
let it develop let it become more cheap

9476.04 --> 9480.960000000001
more standardized that smokers will

9478.92 --> 9482.76
always like come somewhere it's like

9480.96 --> 9485.319
where's the smoker's room and they'll

9482.76 --> 9486.800000000001
they'll never have to wonder like oh can

9485.319 --> 9489.039999999999
I smoke in

9486.8 --> 9490.88
here that they'll know like where's the

9489.04 --> 9492.399000000001
smoker's room that they don't have to

9490.88 --> 9494.96
worry about it and that other people

9492.399 --> 9496.84
don't have to worry about the smokers

9494.96 --> 9500.278999999999
like oh this is a smoking place I don't

9496.84 --> 9501.52
want to be here it makes me unwell that

9500.279 --> 9504.479000000001
everything will be all right there can

9501.52 --> 9508.479000000001
be smokers and nonsmokers alongside and

9504.479 --> 9510.319
both of them satisfied that's what I

9508.479 --> 9512.64
want to accomplish with the smoker

9510.319 --> 9512.64
rights

9514.24 --> 9520.199999999999
party yeah go organic tobacco Growers

9518.0 --> 9520.2
good

9520.96 --> 9523.96
idea

9524.04 --> 9530.68
yeah smokers most smoker rights

9527.8 --> 9533.278999999999
Manifesto sure well the smoker rights

9530.68 --> 9535.279
Manifesto would be basically what I've

9533.279 --> 9539.359
been summarizing the entire

9535.279 --> 9541.16
show and yeah I mean organic un organic

9539.359 --> 9543.319
revolutions like there was an organic

9541.16 --> 9546.479
food industry

9543.319 --> 9550.0
Revolution I think that the the

9546.479 --> 9551.0
tobacco industry should undergo the same

9550.0 --> 9554.359
like

9551.0 --> 9558.2
radically it's like okay well with your

9554.359 --> 9560.640000000001
big factories and all that you can go

9558.2 --> 9564.04
with the transition and if you don't

9560.64 --> 9567.358999999999
then get the hell out and never come

9564.04 --> 9570.960000000001
back right you adapt no more secret

9567.359 --> 9576.12
sauces no more commercial mind control

9570.96 --> 9579.319
crap and and and bad cheap

9576.12 --> 9583.76
[ __ ] you go organic you go clean you go

9579.319 --> 9583.76
oldfashioned or get the hell

9583.8 --> 9591.358999999999
out yeah lower the

9587.0 --> 9592.88
taxes but if you like not on big tobacco

9591.359 --> 9595.800000000001
products like they should be made

9592.88 --> 9600.92
illegal not highly taxed

9595.8 --> 9600.92
illegal illegal not highly taxed

9601.399 --> 9610.519999999999
illegal that's how I see the future with

9607.52 --> 9610.52
smokers

9611.12 --> 9615.560000000001
right can't trust anyone that says it I

9613.64 --> 9619.72
totally disagree Bill n

9615.56 --> 9621.359
sign I totally and utterly disagree I

9619.72 --> 9623.92
don't really care if you're skeptic

9621.359 --> 9626.279
about it I've lived it it

9623.92 --> 9630.439
works uh there's a system for it it

9626.279 --> 9633.279
costs a little extra sure but it's I'm

9630.439 --> 9637.880000000001
absolutely happy that it exists and it

9633.279 --> 9642.359
has made a massive difference in quality

9637.88 --> 9644.96
massive like absolutely provably massive

9642.359 --> 9644.960000000001
difference in

9645.08 --> 9651.84
quality and so I don't care if you don't

9649.56 --> 9655.16
trust anything that says it's organic

9651.84 --> 9658.16
that's not my problem I do trust it I've
