218.92 --> 231.16
fired up mood I could say downright

224.109 --> 233.29000000000002
angry actually and well it's not even

231.16 --> 236.609
because of something specific maybe it

233.29 --> 240.4
has something to do that this night I

236.609 --> 243.519
experienced the most excruciating pain

240.4 --> 246.43
I've ever remembered since five years

243.519 --> 248.31900000000002
that time that I literally hallucinate

246.43 --> 252.81900000000002
it from the pain and that happened last

248.319 --> 256.299
night as well and it was so bad that in

252.819 --> 261.039
the storm ring I just needed to walk

256.299 --> 263.04999999999995
just to get some vibration going through

261.039 --> 264.789
that pain that I could not get away no

263.05 --> 268.15000000000003
matter what because it was a

264.789 --> 269.68
psychosomatic backlash from probably one

268.15 --> 274.71
of the worst experience in my entire

269.68 --> 277.98
lifetime and made me throw up eventually

274.71 --> 285.79999999999995
so I I survived that

277.98 --> 285.8
Oh Oh your lulling that are you

291.59 --> 298.78999999999996

310.73 --> 318.53000000000003

[Music]

454.96 --> 462.38
you know that it's still hurts now it's

458.24 --> 465.11
still going on it's just not so painful

462.38 --> 469.52
that I'm hallucinating from the pain

465.11 --> 476.71000000000004
anymore that's just a difference but it

469.52 --> 476.71
still hurts I'm literally sweating here

477.79 --> 491.51000000000005
no it's not the pastry shut the [ __ ] up

481.73 --> 494.69
Sean Thornhill now it's not corona

491.51 --> 497.75
either it's a psychosomatic backlash of

494.69 --> 501.53
the most horrific realization I've ever

497.75 --> 507.98
had in my life okay from freaking 20

501.53 --> 510.71
years ago yeah that's what that is it's

507.98 --> 514.13
literally my soul being torn apart an

510.71 --> 520.9399999999999
echo of that the most painful thing I've

514.13 --> 524.12
ever experienced it's right here

520.94 --> 526.7600000000001
right here my solar plexus it literally

524.12 --> 528.95
feels like I swallowed a piece of glass

526.76 --> 530.93
and it will not go away and it's

528.95 --> 534.8900000000001
constantly cutting in me from the inside

530.93 --> 537.65
and another time it just feels like it's

534.89 --> 539.96
swelling up like a mysterious infection

537.65 --> 542.3
that's literally not an infection and

539.96 --> 546.5
it's just all pure pain

542.3 --> 548.39
poor poor pure pain just radiating out

546.5 --> 551.11
and there's nothing I can do about it

548.39 --> 553.58
because nothing stops it it's pure

551.11 --> 556.16
psychosomatic I cannot even use

553.58 --> 560.48
painkillers to get it away it will not

556.16 --> 562.73
go away it's pure torture pure torture

560.48 --> 571.49
and there's nothing I can do to stop it

562.73 --> 574.91
okay yeah yeah shut up

571.49 --> 578.26
Anders days and piss off you can't

574.91 --> 578.26

588.48 --> 596.1990000000001

593.41 --> 598.54
barely even smoked anything yesterday I

596.199 --> 602.62
barely drank anything I didn't even have

598.54 --> 605.68
dinner barely just a little it literally

602.62 --> 609.73
came out of nowhere so spare me your

605.68 --> 612.459
[ __ ] wannabe doctor analysis okay I

609.73 --> 614.9490000000001

612.459 --> 618.279
not need your guesswork

614.949 --> 621.37
okay people none of you none of you not

618.279 --> 622.98
even the good ones not even people like

621.37 --> 626.86
good servant

622.98 --> 630.4490000000001
Gideon SiC Ober mukou I don't need your

626.86 --> 634.36
advice I know exactly what this is and

630.449 --> 637.99
there is nothing you can add to that I'm

634.36 --> 647.23
just venting my [ __ ] frustration with

637.99 --> 653.199
my existence here okay that's it hurt it

647.23 --> 655.149
hurt a [ __ ] much just and I'm just

653.199 --> 658.269
really pissed off because I know what

655.149 --> 663.66
caused it I kind of remember now

658.269 --> 669.07
something that broke me 20 years ago

663.66 --> 671.41
mmm yeah because I was such a good mood

669.07 --> 673.5100000000001
back then that I thought wow I think I

671.41 --> 676.6
really get this world and creation and

673.51 --> 679.269
all that and I finally understand that

676.6 --> 682.48
there's good in everyone well guess what

679.269 --> 685.899
somebody that knew me didn't like me

682.48 --> 689.29
feeling that good so he thought it was a

685.899 --> 695.17
great idea to basically show me the dark

689.29 --> 703.4699999999999
side which went well about as far as you

695.17 --> 703.4699999999999
can imagine and that literally broke me

703.8 --> 710.04
yeah hurt so much that I could not my

707.589 --> 712.149
consciousness could not even allow me to

710.04 --> 717.9699999999999
understand what was happening that

712.149 --> 724.839
painful yeah even though physically I

717.97 --> 726.72
was basically untouched yeah but I

724.839 --> 730.259
remember now

726.72 --> 734.9100000000001
you know how much [ __ ] hate that

730.259 --> 746.4300000000001
thing that they did to me that they do

734.91 --> 746.43
how much hate that whales up it is yeah

748.079 --> 761.4699999999999
no human being should ever have to

753.37 --> 764.5
experience anything like that ever yet I

761.47 --> 767.73
did and I barely survived it

764.5 --> 771.809
it was so bad actually I was so disc

767.73 --> 775.509
cognition so discs imported from myself

771.809 --> 779.29
that I literally spent a great deal of

775.509 --> 783.73
time just focused on trying to forget

779.29 --> 786.75
everything and I drank and I smoked the

783.73 --> 789.4300000000001
[ __ ] out of things oh yeah all the way

786.75 --> 791.74
no hard drugs though because I knew

789.43 --> 796.2399999999999
that's just gonna kill me very quickly

791.74 --> 797.6800000000001
in this state of mind now we did not get

796.24 --> 800.019
a crazy-ass storm light night the

797.68 --> 802.199
crazy-ass storm was me it was right here

800.019 --> 805.47
and it hurt like hell

802.199 --> 805.4699999999999
literal hell

821.69 --> 829.0790000000001
yeah it's not hurting like hell now by

825.12 --> 832.01
the way it's just really raw think about

829.079 --> 834.3199999999999
I don't know just imagine getting

832.01 --> 837.93
smacked in the stomach

834.32 --> 840.149
30 times but not so hard that it'll

837.93 --> 842.519
actually start bleeding but bet it'll

840.149 --> 845.1
hurt big-time every single time thirty

842.519 --> 847.529
times in the stomach right well guess

845.1 --> 849.3000000000001
what a week after that it's got to feel

847.529 --> 853.86
pretty sore well that's how it [ __ ]

849.3 --> 856.5889999999999
feels it doesn't hurt right now but it's

853.86 --> 858.72
just completely the nerves are just

856.589 --> 865.8900000000001
burned through from the pain that I

858.72 --> 868.0790000000001
experienced yesterday night it's amazing

865.89 --> 870.0
that I managed to even sleep afterward I

868.079 --> 872.01
thought that I would not be able to

870.0 --> 875.01
sleep that I would just walk around

872.01 --> 876.63
until I would faint and basically you

875.01 --> 880.17
fall to the ground that's what I thought

876.63 --> 883.43
was gonna happen luckily enough I did

880.17 --> 886.79
get out of it even though it took hours

883.43 --> 889.62
hours of constant non-ending

886.79 --> 902.0999999999999
excruciating pain that cannot be blocked

889.62 --> 905.1
yeah who did that to me well reality did

902.1 --> 906.2900000000001
that to me who basically made that

905.1 --> 909.51
happen

906.29 --> 913.56
psychopaths the worst Psychopaths you

909.51 --> 921.48
can imagine the worst Psychopaths you

913.56 --> 923.91
can imagine that are so bad that you

921.48 --> 926.91
can't even see that they're that bad

923.91 --> 930.449
it's really tough to even realize how

926.91 --> 936.449
bad they are because they are not human

930.449 --> 941.81
anymore they're surreal it's it it

936.449 --> 941.81
breaks your mind these people

955.28 --> 958.4
[Applause]

960.339 --> 966.85
what triggered it time time triggered it

967.48 --> 974.6800000000001
probably roughly 20 years which seems to

971.99 --> 974.6800000000001
be typical

984.67 --> 994.9
right anyway I'm suspecting and very

992.2 --> 999.6700000000001
deeply hoping that last night was the

994.9 --> 1002.97
worst of it I can't imagine it flaming

999.67 --> 1003.39
up that bad again after such a short

1002.97 --> 1004.89
time

1003.39 --> 1006.9
in the last time I went through

1004.89 --> 1009.81
something similar like this not

1006.9 --> 1011.6999999999999
literally this it wasn't bound to the

1009.81 --> 1013.8599999999999
same experience it was bound to other

1011.7 --> 1015.2700000000001
things that was previous so it's kind of

1013.86 --> 1018.8100000000001
typical last time something like this

1015.27 --> 1021.66
happened was for yeah four years ago

1018.81 --> 1024.36
five years ago which relates to

1021.66 --> 1026.31
something in my teens so yeah it seems

1024.36 --> 1030.4799999999998
like I have this freaking 20 year echo

1026.31 --> 1032.4589999999998
time so yeah I can pretty much count

1030.48 --> 1035.339
down like okay well I went through

1032.459 --> 1037.65
something excruciating the horrific back

1035.339 --> 1039.4489999999998
then so it's about time that I'm gonna

1037.65 --> 1048.39
get like the second wave now and get all

1039.449 --> 1050.4
[ __ ] up so yeah yeah but this time was

1048.39 --> 1052.89
a lot worse than last time even though

1050.4 --> 1057.3000000000002
last time my mental state was a lot

1052.89 --> 1059.7
worse because I had well the echo came

1057.3 --> 1062.55
back I was also kind of freshly broken

1059.7 --> 1065.97
from yeah well it's breaking up with my

1062.55 --> 1069.78
ex-girlfriend and all that so this time

1065.97 --> 1077.04
my mind is very stable despite all this

1069.78 --> 1081.78
rage right clear and so even though the

1077.04 --> 1086.93
the echo was much more painful much more

1081.78 --> 1089.67
an experience of pain itself yeah I

1086.93 --> 1091.89
didn't go absolutely nuts because of it

1089.67 --> 1097.4
I'm just today I woke up and I just

1091.89 --> 1097.4
realized wow this world is so [ __ ] up

1098.21 --> 1107.97
so [ __ ] up so many people that are

1103.92 --> 1111.15
just hanging around literally trying not

1107.97 --> 1113.7
to become conscious of how [ __ ] up the

1111.15 --> 1116.2800000000002
world is and that seems to be the

1113.7 --> 1118.059
majority of people really it's like

1116.28 --> 1120.789
everyone is just deaths

1118.059 --> 1124.379
to keep their consciousness down so it

1120.789 --> 1127.509
doesn't penetrate how horrific

1124.379 --> 1130.09
everything is really how would her if ik

1127.509 --> 1132.549
it works how they are caught up in it

1130.09 --> 1135.009
how they were fooled how they are bound

1132.549 --> 1138.149
by their own stupid little selfish ego

1135.009 --> 1141.129
thing is to not get out of it it's like

horrific thing going on but I can't do

1143.139 --> 1148.599
anything about it but because I don't

1145.419 --> 1152.95
want to lose my job I don't wanna use my

1148.599 --> 1156.399
job so I'll let that horrific anti human

1152.95 --> 1159.1290000000001
[ __ ] keep continuing for 20 years 30

1156.399 --> 1161.859

need

1342.89 --> 1350.96
thank you John I really appreciate that

1346.7 --> 1350.96
I'm glad you understand

1365.14 --> 1372.6200000000001
it's not even about empathy Gideon SiC

1368.24 --> 1374.78
ADM has plenty of empathy he just

1372.62 --> 1378.8
doesn't know when to bite his own tongue

1374.78 --> 1381.02
that's his problem it's like he uses

1378.8 --> 1383.18
jokes like jacking off he can't hold the

1381.02 --> 1385.16
tension he can't just hold it he has to

1383.18 --> 1387.17
freaking mmm

1385.16 --> 1389.1200000000001
he has to do that it's like jacking off

1387.17 --> 1391.79
sorry to get gross on you AG I'm not

1389.12 --> 1395.0
saying you do that but it effectively is

1391.79 --> 1395.51
exactly like that you always do that

1395.0 --> 1397.49
[ __ ]

1395.51 --> 1399.14
you always make jokes even when it's not

1397.49 --> 1401.48
appropriate because you can't hold the

1399.14 --> 1404.3600000000001
tension you can't bite your tongue you

1401.48 --> 1410.51
didn't learn that did you must be very

1404.36 --> 1412.8799999999999
tough on yet and III know because I

1410.51 --> 1425.72
myself have a lot of trouble sometimes

1412.88 --> 1428.5100000000002
biting my own tongue but yeah you are

1425.72 --> 1431.66
that bad agent you are but that's

1428.51 --> 1434.919
alright you're only human

1431.66 --> 1434.919
[Music]

1438.92 --> 1443.479
[Music]

1449.87 --> 1457.35
it's okay it's alright AJ it's fine man

1455.07 --> 1474.3899999999999
I didn't even go through a chat with all

1457.35 --> 1476.6999999999998
this anger chaos yeah and I've been

1474.39 --> 1478.3200000000002
thinking about that a lot in the face of

1476.7 --> 1482.43
what I have experienced what has come

1478.32 --> 1484.62
back to me good servant and you know the

1482.43 --> 1488.46
the biggest problem was and that was

1484.62 --> 1491.4599999999998
back then back then as well is that in

1488.46 --> 1495.32
the face of such overwhelming atrocity

1491.46 --> 1498.18
and evil it becomes very tough very

1495.32 --> 1501.53
tough to respect and uphold the

1498.18 --> 1508.01
principles of Christ very very tough

1501.53 --> 1508.01
because for me I don't know I'm just

1511.64 --> 1519.17
I tried to do it but really all I can

1515.96 --> 1522.17
think about is kind of well it's a it's

1519.17 --> 1527.03
a episode 82 of response really that's

1522.17 --> 1531.47
what's coming out of me with this I just

1527.03 --> 1534.31
want them to end quickly just quickly

1531.47 --> 1537.65
get the atrocity out of the way quickly

1534.31 --> 1541.52
you need to surgically remove this as

1537.65 --> 1545.0600000000002
quickly as possible do not let it fester

1541.52 --> 1548.32
please God please do not let it fester

1545.06 --> 1548.32
any further please

1560.71 --> 1562.71
ah

1570.11 --> 1573.75
[Music]

1575.16 --> 1581.44
thank you question everything I

1577.33 --> 1584.8
appreciate that it's it's not even it's

1581.44 --> 1587.6200000000001
just some people they they can't handle

1584.8 --> 1591.76
when things get serious they cannot

1587.62 --> 1595.09
handle that sometimes things are really

1591.76 --> 1599.8
real some people can't handle it they

1595.09 --> 1603.61
just can't so they have to make a stupid

1599.8 --> 1605.1399999999999
joke out of it or have to cartoon unify

1603.61 --> 1611.11
it in their minds and then then play

1605.14 --> 1613.21
around with they can't help it but at

1611.11 --> 1616.09
the same time I can't help but ban you

1613.21 --> 1621.19
then when you do that that's just how it

1616.09 --> 1624.49
works thank you for the prayers it may

1621.19 --> 1627.9
actually help somewhat since well pain

1624.49 --> 1627.9
medication doesn't help

1629.25 --> 1635.56
although yeah again I'm not currently in

1632.23 --> 1637.54
pain it's just that it's still rough and

1635.56 --> 1639.79
I hope it doesn't come back

1637.54 --> 1643.1499999999999
I really hope like because last time

1639.79 --> 1646.99
yesterday I had it to in several I had

1643.15 --> 1649.96
it before the show yesterday and I had

1646.99 --> 1653.11
it after the show then it went away and

1649.96 --> 1658.77
then suddenly it came back like three

1653.11 --> 1662.4699999999998
times as bad god I hope there is no

1658.77 --> 1664.36
there is no fourth wave god I don't know

1662.47 --> 1666.57
if I could take anything stronger than

1664.36 --> 1669.9299999999998
what I experienced yesterday night I

1666.57 --> 1672.6299999999999
don't know if I could survive that I

1669.93 --> 1676.98
hope not

1672.63 --> 1676.98
okay now I made myself nervous

1681.739 --> 1684.739
yeah

1693.7 --> 1696.7
yeah

1703.44 --> 1708.93
yeah you know what the craziest thing is

1706.14 --> 1711.15
about the ultimate darkness I'm not even

1708.93 --> 1717.17
getting gonna get specific the craziest

1711.15 --> 1723.21
thing is it all works on mechanized

1717.17 --> 1729.15
automated self-loathing in the

1723.21 --> 1732.18
subconscious it is so it's a it is it is

1729.15 --> 1737.5500000000002
pure subconscious self-destructiveness

1732.18 --> 1740.3600000000001
that actually keeps it in place and it

1737.55 --> 1743.22
gets even crazier when you realize that

1740.36 --> 1747.0
for all the atrocities these type of

1743.22 --> 1750.39
people commit the one that is the most

1747.0 --> 1754.86
hurt the most tortured the most in pain

1750.39 --> 1759.6000000000001
is themselves themselves locked up in a

1754.86 --> 1764.34
cage put in the dark moved out so far

1759.6 --> 1768.54
that they literally cannot remember that

1764.34 --> 1770.9399999999998
aspect of themselves and they make a

1768.54 --> 1774.36
puzzle for it so that nobody can uncover

1770.94 --> 1777.72
it and that is really what they do it is

1774.36 --> 1780.87
so maniacal it is fascinating in a way

1777.72 --> 1787.01
but it's a fascination that should not

1780.87 --> 1792.84
lead to anything but they're erasing and

1787.01 --> 1795.24
deep deep deep deep inside that is

1792.84 --> 1798.06
exactly what they want and need they

1795.24 --> 1801.24
wanted all to end really they just can't

1798.06 --> 1806.46
get there they can't get there anymore

1801.24 --> 1808.94
they are just pure demon they can't get

1806.46 --> 1808.94
there anymore

1812.1 --> 1815.1
anyway

1819.88 --> 1825.8500000000001
yeah there is a chakra right there

1822.17 --> 1830.3000000000002
that's right no meditating dude dude

1825.85 --> 1832.8999999999999
again that one guy it was you probably

1830.3 --> 1839.12
missed it at the start of the show

1832.9 --> 1842.39
Nigerian sick demon look demons are what

1839.12 --> 1845.6599999999999
is left when you scoop out the full

1842.39 --> 1848.69
personality spectrum we all have all of

1845.66 --> 1852.98
us every single human being and animal

1848.69 --> 1858.53
all living things have demonic aspects

1852.98 --> 1860.66
within them all of it all of it and that

1858.53 --> 1864.32
will be forever

1860.66 --> 1866.3000000000002
as long as life exists problem is is

1864.32 --> 1869.3
that these people have literally just

1866.3 --> 1871.46
surgically psychologically mutilated

1869.3 --> 1874.06
themselves and probably their parents

1871.46 --> 1876.74
helped with that as well because

1874.06 --> 1879.74
something somebody like that with that

1876.74 --> 1883.07
setup does not come into the world as a

1879.74 --> 1885.2
fluke no they are trained to become like

1883.07 --> 1887.1799999999998
that usually involving their own

1885.2 --> 1891.1100000000001
freaking parents which are just as

1887.18 --> 1898.63
maniacal even maybe even worse but very

1891.11 --> 1901.1299999999999
well-hidden and yeah they just

1898.63 --> 1905.93
psychologically mutilate themselves they

1901.13 --> 1909.16
surgically remove concepts and feelings

1905.93 --> 1911.9
and things that they kind of are do that

1909.16 --> 1914.63
ideologically discard even though the

1911.9 --> 1917.18
ideology to them even is just another

1914.63 --> 1920.42
illusion but they still allow themselves

1917.18 --> 1924.0800000000002
to do that using that as an excuse to

1920.42 --> 1927.3200000000002
tame their inner selves and then when

1924.08 --> 1929.9299999999998
it's all removed they forget about it

1927.32 --> 1932.6899999999998
they literally forget that those things

1929.93 --> 1936.3200000000002
are really their sinks all the way and

1932.69 --> 1938.81
that is when yeah when all that when the

1936.32 --> 1941.1799999999998
holes are there when suddenly you no

1938.81 --> 1943.61
longer recognized a natural element that

1941.18 --> 1948.41
is part of you that's literally where

1943.61 --> 1950.7199999999998
the demon steps in and like basically

1948.41 --> 1952.999
effectively tells you don't worry I'll

1950.72 --> 1955.1290000000001
take care of the rest

1952.999 --> 1959.959
it's kind of the process that happens in

1955.129 --> 1963.589
the mind but that demon that sort of

1959.959 --> 1966.739
other figure is really a part of

1963.589 --> 1975.6989999999998
themselves it's just a more mechanical

1966.739 --> 1980.179
part it's crazy how it works

1975.699 --> 1982.0990000000002
it is like perpetual self OB it's in a

1980.179 --> 1987.789
way people that are like that just keep

1982.099 --> 1987.789
themselves in a tortured state forever

1993.51 --> 1999.93
you could yeah torture themselves until

1996.24 --> 2001.94
they forget who they are then you keep

1999.93 --> 2004.88
doing that and they do that to each

2001.94 --> 2008.51
other and they even keep track like hey

2004.88 --> 2010.0700000000002
ooh your side your soul is accidentally

2008.51 --> 2013.93
starting to shine through let's get rid

2010.07 --> 2013.9299999999998
of that quickly that's what they do

2016.78 --> 2022.94
and I don't even want to know this I

2020.09 --> 2027.11
don't wanna know this but don't want to

2022.94 --> 2052.33
know this why why do I know this I hate

2027.11 --> 2052.33
it I hate this knowledge we hate it yeah

2055.13 --> 2061.27
yeah knowledge inside inside in how

2058.46 --> 2065.2400000000002
these things work I don't want to know I

2061.27 --> 2069.2
don't want to understand it I wish I

2065.24 --> 2072.5
never I wish it didn't exist I wish this

2069.2 --> 2075.98
was not part of the design and there

2072.5 --> 2078.62
comes a conflict because really creator

2075.98 --> 2083.45
really you're gonna make it that bad

2078.62 --> 2087.64
you're gonna make it that bad isn't

2083.45 --> 2093.1099999999997
there just some point where a challenge

2087.64 --> 2095.6
cannot be overcome anymore I I just

2093.11 --> 2098.81
don't get it maybe it's just because I'm

2095.6 --> 2103.19
a [ __ ] limited human mind and I just

2098.81 --> 2106.36
can't handle this [ __ ] maybe there are

2103.19 --> 2109.04
people out there that are that have that

2106.36 --> 2111.98
similar experience that did manage to

2109.04 --> 2115.06
get overcome this I don't know I can

2111.98 --> 2115.06
barely imagine it

2128.2 --> 2133.1499999999996
don't really oh we're gonna do that

2131.02 --> 2135.15
you're you're gonna split apart you're

2133.15 --> 2137.8
gonna split it apart no no AGM

2135.15 --> 2141.2400000000002
creationist creation everything that is

2137.8 --> 2144.48
everything that comes everything

2141.24 --> 2147.8489999999997
everything yeah everything every aspect

2144.48 --> 2151.66
including the deviations including the

2147.849 --> 2156.339
delusions including the evil yeah all of

2151.66 --> 2157.27
it there is no escape from the design it

2156.339 --> 2163.0499999999997
is all of it

2157.27 --> 2164.56
and all that would be was meant to be

2163.05 --> 2167.05
alpha-omega

2164.56 --> 2168.88
all of it there is no exclusion and this

2167.05 --> 2173.13
is the mind breaker to me this is the

2168.88 --> 2173.13
mind breaker I can't understand that

2173.88 --> 2181.27
the design would allow darkness to

2178.48 --> 2187.41
manifest this level as part of creation

2181.27 --> 2187.41
I can't I can't understand it

2216.859 --> 2224.42
yeah well that one guy that's a really

2219.92 --> 2226.219
interesting philosophical aspect of the

2224.42 --> 2228.92
oath of everything right

2226.219 --> 2231.65
yeah uses fire to forge a sword his

2228.92 --> 2234.7690000000002
sword his wards what and what do those

2231.65 --> 2239.1800000000003
swords do they they fight right the dark

2234.769 --> 2242.209
so it's just that is that it is that

2239.18 --> 2246.519
creation it's just good evil good fight

2242.209 --> 2250.0989999999997
evil die new good evil good fight over

2246.519 --> 2255.89
that's it is that the point is that the

2250.099 --> 2263.809
freaking point why why forge a sword

2255.89 --> 2266.9
why forge a warrior why like I can't

2263.809 --> 2269.15
figure it out I know it's there i chosen

2266.9 --> 2271.069
i yeah i am a sort of god

2269.15 --> 2276.369
I have wield the flame of honor but I

2271.069 --> 2280.18
don't understand I don't understand I

2276.369 --> 2280.1800000000003
can't get this

2284.7 --> 2293.1299999999997
maybe I will I just don't get the point

2288.31 --> 2293.13
right now

2295.57 --> 2298.679
[Music]

2302.94 --> 2308.03
[Music]

2315.67 --> 2318.78
[Music]

2320.819 --> 2328.359
that's nice Amanda um so if you pray

2324.13 --> 2329.049
everyday what do you pray for what do

2328.359 --> 2332.5
you pray for

2329.049 --> 2335.92
you know I've I know that prayer works

2332.5 --> 2340.24
but I know that prayer's are like wishes

2335.92 --> 2342.91
and every wish as it's always a balance

2340.24 --> 2349.75
so even with prayer anything anything

2342.91 --> 2354.1299999999997
you inquire from God everything has a

2349.75 --> 2355.75
price there's nothing that does not have

2354.13 --> 2362.369
a price one way or the other

2355.75 --> 2365.019
nothing in this world is free nothing

2362.369 --> 2372.369
that doesn't mean that everything costs

2365.019 --> 2374.2
money nothing is free so every time I

2372.369 --> 2376.9
think a prayer so what are you gonna

2374.2 --> 2380.769
pray for are you gonna send that energy

2376.9 --> 2384.25
to that thing what is that energy gonna

2380.769 --> 2386.769
be taken away from that's cut the red

2384.25 --> 2389.98
yeah law second law thermodynamics and

2386.769 --> 2397.5389999999998
all that or what is the first law energy

2389.98 --> 2400.359
so even God energy you know that just is

2397.539 --> 2402.46
there infinite it's there is there

2400.359 --> 2406.21
really infinite energy like even with

2402.46 --> 2409.829
God you could argue that God has all the

2406.21 --> 2413.23
energy available to him because he is

2409.829 --> 2415.69
creation so yeah he would have all the

2413.23 --> 2418.2690000000002
energy but does that mean that there is

2415.69 --> 2422.619
infinite energy or that there's just

2418.269 --> 2425.6189999999997
enough energy for creation how do you

2422.619 --> 2429.94
think about it think about it really

2425.619 --> 2432.9700000000003
really deeply now because that's what I

2429.94 --> 2435.16
do it's like all these exoteric

2432.97 --> 2439.509
conclusions even from the Bible and the

2435.16 --> 2442.92
philosophy concerning creation it's how

2439.509 --> 2447.88
well do people actually think about this

2442.92 --> 2449.66
you know really think about it unlimited

2447.88 --> 2452.78
energy like

2449.66 --> 2455.1189999999997
just unlimited unlimited like oh now

2452.78 --> 2456.829
everything is good everything will be

2455.119 --> 2459.829
good all the Dark One's are all just

2456.829 --> 2463.549
gonna be gone dead and buried and all

2459.829 --> 2465.4100000000003
that all the pollution written out of

2463.549 --> 2469.49
the products and everything is going to

2465.41 --> 2471.5589999999997
be good and everybody's gonna be I don't

2469.49 --> 2474.14
know Christian or religious or whatever

2471.559 --> 2476.27
doing good having families and then what

2474.14 --> 2479.44
and then after that and then after that

2476.27 --> 2483.65
and then after that and then after that

2479.44 --> 2487.819
does anybody ever really think about

2483.65 --> 2491.9
this or do they just all say no oh this

2487.819 --> 2494.24
is just good it's like oh the the plant

2491.9 --> 2496.88
is blooming blooming is good it's

2494.24 --> 2499.8489999999997
beautiful look at that it's good yeah we

2496.88 --> 2503.21
live now it's good so it's good well I

2499.849 --> 2505.67
think why think about anything ever when

2503.21 --> 2508.43
you know exactly how to get things good

2505.67 --> 2511.609
with in your time span of your life you

2508.43 --> 2514.339
know and that seems to be the universal

2511.609 --> 2520.0099999999998
problem for all of humanity whether they

2514.339 --> 2523.7599999999998
are good-hearted or not does anybody

2520.01 --> 2531.0200000000004
just ever really think about what's

2523.76 --> 2532.8190000000004
going on how things really work instead

2531.02 --> 2535.4
of just trying to make things

2532.819 --> 2537.88
comfortable for themselves within their

2535.4 --> 2539.6600000000003
lifespan within their personal

2537.88 --> 2542.089
conceptualization of what reality is

2539.66 --> 2544.0099999999998
supposed to be according to that because

2542.089 --> 2546.17
I think that's what most people do I

2544.01 --> 2552.2000000000003
don't think that most people even really

2546.17 --> 2555.17
try to think the hard stuff really not

2552.2 --> 2558.799
even Christians almost nobody nobody

2555.17 --> 2563.059
almost nobody really thinks about the

2558.799 --> 2564.7599999999998
real things no always eventually end up

2563.059 --> 2567.349
in some kind of peer pressure

2564.76 --> 2570.6400000000003
self-created or external like oh we

2567.349 --> 2575.92
should not do this we should not yeah

2570.64 --> 2575.92
that's what I see all of it all of it

2577.37 --> 2580.42
[Music]

2591.83 --> 2594.4
yeah

2597.64 --> 2601.799
yeah you know what's crazy about that

2599.829 --> 2611.4100000000003
carry me in the face of evil

2601.799 --> 2616.769
most people basically try to survive by

2611.41 --> 2616.769
killing off their long-term chances

2617.4 --> 2624.64
that's how to do it and it's basically

2622.48 --> 2626.71
like yeah you have two choices or you're

2624.64 --> 2627.519
gonna have a hard life and you can win

2626.71 --> 2631.48
something

2627.519 --> 2634.45
some honor all that or you can go along

2631.48 --> 2637.14
with it and you'll be absolutely dead

2634.45 --> 2640.2
and ashamed and feel like [ __ ]

2637.14 --> 2643.3799999999997
afterwards maybe even kill yourself and

2640.2 --> 2646.8689999999997
most people will just kill choose that

2643.38 --> 2648.46
because they can then to themselves do a

2646.869 --> 2650.829
little satanic switch in their heads and

2648.46 --> 2654.059
just forget about it forget that they

2650.829 --> 2657.9100000000003
actually have that responsibility and

2654.059 --> 2660.549
just so we have a life occasion twenty

2657.91 --> 2662.859
years ago after that move who cares you

2660.549 --> 2667.18
know I'll just try to escape try to talk

2662.859 --> 2672.489
my way out get away yeah that's what

2667.18 --> 2675.989
most people do so most people do and it

2672.489 --> 2678.989
is absolutely disgusting

2675.989 --> 2678.989
disgusting

2691.56 --> 2694.67
[Music]

2709.78 --> 2712.44
Wow

2712.48 --> 2718.72
New York City I am well if you're gonna

2716.51 --> 2730.4300000000003
live in New York City you're literally

2718.72 --> 2732.6189999999997
asking for accelerator basically in my

2730.43 --> 2735.44
opinion anybody that's gonna live in a

2732.619 --> 2740.03
really big city like that without being

2735.44 --> 2744.08
very wealthy is out of their mind but

2740.03 --> 2746.57
that's just my opinion because it's all

2744.08 --> 2748.73
just a giant meat grinder all big cities

2746.57 --> 2751.099
are giant meat grinders if you don't

2748.73 --> 2760.67
have the money then you're gonna end up

2751.099 --> 2763.4900000000002
in the freakin meat grinder ya know is

2760.67 --> 2766.91
it though the work is in the city

2763.49 --> 2774.3999999999996
really so what the work is in the city

2766.91 --> 2774.3999999999996
exclusively what work is in the city why

2774.67 --> 2781.099
why couldn't you do that work out of the

2778.64 --> 2785.39
city like how much of this work really

2781.099 --> 2788.3590000000004
is just dependent on computers something

2785.39 --> 2791.21
like that you know how much do you

2788.359 --> 2793.16
really need that City location in order

2791.21 --> 2796.33
to do what you do for a living

2793.16 --> 2796.33
think about it

2799.65 --> 2806.53
Amanda young sorry that didn't mean that

2802.06 --> 2808.24
personally and and by the way you seem

2806.53 --> 2811.84
to be getting around so glad to hear

2808.24 --> 2814.93
that I'm just saying that if you like if

2811.84 --> 2817.4100000000003
you're like really poor and you just go

2814.93 --> 2821.02
and live in a city that's just like God

2817.41 --> 2825.79
why would you do that I'd go as far away

2821.02 --> 2831.21
as I could I just I prefer the I don't

2825.79 --> 2833.83
know go more to rural areas and just

2831.21 --> 2836.369
still help out a farmer or something

2833.83 --> 2838.96
it's much more rewarding anyway

2836.369 --> 2842.58
personally unless they're like GMO

2838.96 --> 2842.58
farmers then it's [ __ ] up but

2862.61 --> 2866.1800000000003
yeah flatlander I am in a city but

2865.25 --> 2870.38
Utrecht

2866.18 --> 2876.68
is not a huge city by American standards

2870.38 --> 2879.98
it's a village it's nothing and it is a

2876.68 --> 2883.1
specific it is not a high-rise building

2879.98 --> 2886.94
city like thing is just nothing here

2883.1 --> 2889.73
it's it's a it's a giant living area the

2886.94 --> 2895.9700000000003
entire city is pretty much all living

2889.73 --> 2901.79
houses most of it so it is like a

2895.97 --> 2905.1699999999996
residential city that's what it's seemed

2901.79 --> 2905.17
to be aimed at

2913.11 --> 2916.79
hmm that's sucks phone each

2937.59 --> 2942.21
really for niche well it is I think it's

2940.32 --> 2946.1400000000003
actually better now than it was in the

2942.21 --> 2949.28
80s and 90s I think it's you Triggs a

2946.14 --> 2949.2799999999997
really good city now

2954.66 --> 2958.6189999999997
at least from what I've seen it's not

2956.579 --> 2960.779
perfect isn't that completely without

2958.619 --> 2965.13
crime and all that but it's pretty

2960.779 --> 2967.529
decent and everything is relatively well

2965.13 --> 2969.3900000000003
maintained there's no like neglected

2967.529 --> 2972.42
neighborhoods like there that are really

2969.39 --> 2976.229
bad you know and they've they've done a

2972.42 --> 2980.339
lot of tourist oriented updates like the

2976.229 --> 2984.93
whole train station is just yeah heavily

2980.339 --> 2988.349
updated systems it's very high-tech very

2984.93 --> 2994.259
fluid very ergo dynamic it's just a very

2988.349 --> 2996.69
modernized city in the center and yeah

2994.259 --> 2999.18
pretty much everywhere it's very green

2996.69 --> 3001.67
it's like they put a lot of effort to

2999.18 --> 3004.22
make things green not [ __ ] green but

3001.67 --> 3006.619
just having trees and plants everywhere

3004.22 --> 3010.7
they make a lot of effort for it so yeah

3006.619 --> 3012.739
Utrecht is a really good city living in

3010.7 --> 3014.839
Utrecht was probably one of the better

3012.739 --> 3019.16
decisions that I made in a time when I

3014.839 --> 3023.269
was completely in chaos and I expected

3019.16 --> 3025.509
it to be worse when I did it I thought

3023.269 --> 3028.0389999999998
oh god I'm gonna be stuck in a big city

3025.509 --> 3028.489
but turned didn't turn out to be that

3028.039 --> 3031.1600000000003
bad

3028.489 --> 3033.229
because it is not like New York raised

3031.16 --> 3037.94
the price the prices aren't completely

3033.229 --> 3039.859
outrageous and yeah there's no

3037.94 --> 3042.19
creepy-ass underground scene that is

3039.859 --> 3042.19
huge

3046.41 --> 3052.569
we don't even have Metro systems here in

3049.27 --> 3056.44
Utrecht Paris train so there's no metro

3052.569 --> 3059.319
system like in Amsterdam and the

3056.44 --> 3061.619
Rotterdam and all that there's none of

3059.319 --> 3061.619
that here

3064.26 --> 3070.4700000000003
also they pretty dead there were some

3067.27 --> 3073.03
like junky areas where a lot of like

3070.47 --> 3075.91
hobos and drug users would hang around

3073.03 --> 3077.65
and that was in the 80s and 90s was you

3075.91 --> 3079.39
think oh well 80s at night it was good

3077.65 --> 3082.7200000000003
well that's all gone now

3079.39 --> 3086.3799999999997
they literally made that disappear and

3082.72 --> 3089.23
they I think they picked up a lot of

3086.38 --> 3092.19
these junkies and knobos from the street

3089.23 --> 3096.819
and kind of put them in a special

3092.19 --> 3098.829
recovery thing because yeah there's

3096.819 --> 3103.359
still some hobos around but even they

3098.829 --> 3106.599
don't look incredibly unhealthy so they

3103.359 --> 3110.98
know I think Utrecht really did a

3106.599 --> 3114.21
stellar job as to fixing its overall

3110.98 --> 3114.21
image and situation

3129.359 --> 3135.089
yeah yeah well a gem there's drugs

3133.109 --> 3137.729
everywhere and there's drug dealing

3135.089 --> 3140.91
everywhere guess what it was always

3137.729 --> 3144.93
there it's just cracking down on that

3140.91 --> 3146.459
[ __ ] is completely useless people are

3144.93 --> 3149.19
gonna get their freaking drug and the

3146.459 --> 3155.64
harder you crack down on it the worse

3149.19 --> 3158.849
the crime gets so yeah that's drug

3155.64 --> 3160.2889999999998
dealing yeah it's around sometimes it's

3158.849 --> 3164.069
like even right in front of my nose

3160.289 --> 3166.8590000000004
there it doesn't matter it literally

3164.069 --> 3169.17
doesn't matter these [ __ ] idiots are

3166.859 --> 3173.5989999999997
gonna get their [ __ ] drugs no matter

3169.17 --> 3176.789
what no matter what so just let him

3173.599 --> 3179.369
that's it and then if they get leave

3176.789 --> 3181.13
[ __ ] around they make a mess or if they

3179.369 --> 3183.63
vandalize that's when you get him

3181.13 --> 3184.559
because people are gonna get their

3183.63 --> 3188.4590000000003
freakin drugs

3184.559 --> 3191.2490000000003
anyway they insist they kill themselves

3188.459 --> 3193.9199999999996
with that [ __ ] then let him that's my

3191.249 --> 3197.8489999999997
thought about it I think that the city

3193.92 --> 3200.069
is doing just that cuz they're all

3197.849 --> 3202.199
they're all over the place there's times

3200.069 --> 3206.489
when you just go biking through the city

3202.199 --> 3209.969
and it's like I spot potential deals

3206.489 --> 3213.539
going down with the tired gang with kids

3209.969 --> 3216.449
and all that [ __ ] like three times in a

3213.539 --> 3224.63
row in the single in the single yeah

3216.449 --> 3224.63
bicycle trip so right

3242.97 --> 3251.73
what are you talking about evac 3-1-1

3246.089 --> 3254.04
maybe you should consider spelling out a

3251.73 --> 3257.069
sentence correctly before you press

3254.04 --> 3259.2799999999997
ENTER so I can actually figure out what

3257.069 --> 3259.2799999999997
