[Music]

38.7 --> 46.540000000000006
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.12 --> 48.76
early-bird number 190 I'm your host

46.54 --> 50.739
Arwen and before we start the show

48.76 --> 54.79
please don't forget to share it on any

50.739 --> 56.709999999999994
platform you see fit and also yeah

54.79 --> 58.269
subscribe to my channel of course if you

56.71 --> 59.89
haven't already and hit the bell

58.269 --> 61.36
notification so you know when I'm going

59.89 --> 64.57
live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

61.36 --> 66.03999999999999
amsterdam time every day but sometimes

64.57 --> 70.28999999999999
they can be a little bit early like

66.04 --> 70.29
right now because i get impatient and

71.61 --> 79.35
today it's kind of the same weather

73.78 --> 79.35
yesterday it's a bit more windy

87.26 --> 95.51
and a bit more fresh as well still okay

91.9 --> 98.81
doesn't really rained or anything so

95.51 --> 103.01
today I got no eating

98.81 --> 109.64
I do have tea and I do have tumeric

103.01 --> 111.86
coffee with pepper no milk and I

109.64 --> 113.99
prepared a little bit differently this

111.86 --> 116.72
time I pretty much all jumbled it

113.99 --> 118.61
together but that gave some problems

116.72 --> 122.09
with the filter was very annoying the

118.61 --> 124.7
water kind of didn't want to sink

122.09 --> 125.9
through normally that way apparently so

124.7 --> 128.14000000000001
it took a little longer that was

125.9 --> 128.14000000000001
annoying

128.86 --> 135.41000000000003
Applied Sciences you learn something new

132.05 --> 138.41000000000003
every day but anyway I kind of need it

135.41 --> 147.05
because I had a rough night

138.41 --> 150.89
ooh oh and that is good wow that's even

147.05 --> 156.43
better than yesterday I guess it just

150.89 --> 156.42999999999998
takes a little longer to to brew it

156.55 --> 162.27
that's delicious

160.1 --> 167.97
so yeah I kind of need it because

162.27 --> 172.05
yesterday yeah finally I had to stop

167.97 --> 175.08
waiting for money and I got yeah

172.05 --> 176.85000000000002
was I it had to like the money had to

175.08 --> 178.77
come in yesterday or I would have had a

176.85 --> 181.64
problem because I ran out of food and

178.77 --> 185.16
everything and it did it did exactly

181.64 --> 187.60999999999999
like I kind of expected and then I

185.16 --> 191.66
thought yeah I'm gonna get me some beers

187.61 --> 197.82000000000002
you know kind of to celebrate and

191.66 --> 201.63
started at it like roughly half past

197.82 --> 201.87
7:00 in the evening and I really enjoyed

201.63 --> 204.09
it

201.87 --> 206.49
and then I may have enjoyed it just a

204.09 --> 209.76
little bit too much because I got pretty

206.49 --> 216.75
drunk on five beers didn't get sick at

209.76 --> 223.07999999999998
all thank God but I I went to bed at

216.75 --> 225.6
like 11 o'clock I was like yeah you know

223.08 --> 228.0
what I'm really tired now I can sit here

225.6 --> 230.97
all the time just being really tired or

228.0 --> 233.79
it could really just go to sleep and I

230.97 --> 235.41
had a very long night for a very long

233.79 --> 238.07
day the day before so I thought yeah

235.41 --> 242.79
I'll just catch up on some sleep and

238.07 --> 245.48999999999998
then today I woke up at 6 o'clock and I

242.79 --> 247.14
was like man I'm hungry so I immediately

245.49 --> 252.57000000000002
got a full-on

247.14 --> 255.26999999999998
egg breakfast and it was delicious and a

252.57 --> 259.40999999999997
cup of coffee really early and it was

255.27 --> 261.87
nice and then I felt like oh [ __ ] this

259.41 --> 263.61
is like it so I had like a jet lag

261.87 --> 268.32
effect so I went back to sleep

263.61 --> 272.28000000000003
and then I got up at 11 o'clock so I had

268.32 --> 275.7
a pretty weird day I feel bit groggy so

272.28 --> 279.11999999999995
the beer kind of I tried to use it but

275.7 --> 281.64
it didn't exactly go as expected didn't

279.12 --> 285.36
expect to get up that early and then be

281.64 --> 288.099
that awoke as weird so it's some Tamera

285.36 --> 290.99
coffee to soothe me

288.099 --> 293.99
it's so weird if I would drink coffee

290.99 --> 294.5
when I feel like this it would be a

293.99 --> 297.139
burden

294.5 --> 299.199
I like wouldn't recommend it I need like

297.139 --> 301.909
the one coffee at some point to really

299.199 --> 303.83000000000004
get the momentum going but normally I

301.909 --> 309.86
wouldn't drink coffee when I feel like

303.83 --> 312.65
this but this it feels excellent this is

309.86 --> 313.629
not normal coffee anymore this is Tamara

312.65 --> 320.75
coffee

313.629 --> 321.72900000000004
hmm it actually soothes the stomach it's

320.75 --> 329.509
so weird

321.729 --> 331.849
so let's see who's in chat so Steve was

329.509 --> 335.27000000000004
there earlier he's in charity shop today

331.849 --> 336.44
I don't exactly know what that means by

335.27 --> 339.37899999999996
the way but anyway

336.44 --> 346.96
a drunken bullet for one one glass saw a

339.379 --> 346.96000000000004
GM that one guy yeah good to see you all

347.74 --> 354.58
so I completely missed out um

351.909 --> 358.09
Patricia last night who had somebody

354.58 --> 358.09
because I was asleep

361.87 --> 366.97
right and I still have one spare beer

364.389 --> 370.15000000000003
left I had bought six it's like a six

366.97 --> 373.78000000000003
pack thing and yeah hello by the way

370.15 --> 376.51
truth is truth but yeah there's still

373.78 --> 379.05999999999995
one left I'm glad that I didn't take

376.51 --> 382.9
that one because I've if I had I

379.06 --> 384.729
probably would have become sick so I got

382.9 --> 388.62
one spare beer that I'm just gonna have

384.729 --> 388.62
to wait for a certain occasion to use it

392.49 --> 402.25
but yeah I've had plenty of beers for

395.74 --> 406.69
now right well truth is truth is to be

402.25 --> 411.34
fair it's not just beers I did also get

406.69 --> 416.2
some green in there as well not in the

411.34 --> 423.15999999999997
beer but so that does kind of amplify

416.2 --> 426.13
the whole effect and yeah in general

423.16 --> 429.47900000000004
this is not recommended because it's not

426.13 --> 433.40999999999997
very healthy to do it like that and I

429.479 --> 447.34
think that if I would be smoking without

433.41 --> 449.77000000000004
filters sorry I think that without

447.34 --> 453.15999999999997
filters if I would be smoking next with

449.77 --> 454.93
the beers and you get all the toxins

453.16 --> 457.27000000000004
basically because these filters really

454.93 --> 460.539
carbon filters do actually filter out

457.27 --> 462.96999999999997
most of the the more dangerous toxins

460.539 --> 466.63
and if I would smoke it without just

462.97 --> 469.03000000000003
with the regular paper tips that there's

466.63 --> 471.88
much more likelihood of getting sick

469.03 --> 476.79999999999995
because the damage is your system when

471.88 --> 480.15999999999997
you do it like that or or I would become

476.8 --> 481.72
like nauseated and get a bad trip or

480.16 --> 484.74
something and I had that before it's

481.72 --> 486.57000000000005
it's really

484.74 --> 490.47
kind of dangerous balance but with these

486.57 --> 494.15999999999997
filters I barely have that problem and

490.47 --> 496.20000000000005
it helps a lot but in general I don't

494.16 --> 499.88000000000005
recommend combining alcohol with

496.2 --> 502.44
cannabis it's best to just separated it

499.88 --> 505.29
technically you could do it in a day but

502.44 --> 517.17
just don't do it at the same time keep

505.29 --> 519.36
some time in between or you can actually

517.17 --> 520.5
combine it and then main some make some

519.36 --> 523.86
tincture out of it

520.5 --> 528.51
if you take pure alcohol and you can

523.86 --> 532.32
dissolve the canape the cannabis extract

528.51 --> 536.78
in that and then dissolve the alcohol

532.32 --> 543.33
and you got yourself some cannabinoid

536.78 --> 546.3
THC a resin mixture that's the way they

543.33 --> 549.6
make that stuff so there's definitely

546.3 --> 553.55
uses for alcohol just don't consume it

549.6 --> 553.5500000000001
with cannabis at the same time

557.32 --> 562.1800000000001
or if you do it then do it very

559.94 --> 562.1800000000001
carefully

565.06 --> 570.4399999999999
don't keep hitting it with both things

568.01 --> 572.27
at the same time you know sometimes

570.44 --> 576.5600000000001
people when they drink they can like

572.27 --> 578.4499999999999
really chug it and especially if they do

576.56 --> 580.4
that more often they can I can handle

578.45 --> 582.7700000000001
that but if you then combine that type

580.4 --> 585.0699999999999
of setup with also smoking that's when

582.77 --> 587.87
you get into trouble same goes for

585.07 --> 589.9100000000001
keeping on like really getting yourself

587.87 --> 592.79
freaking stones there's people that do

589.91 --> 596.06
that especially serious pot heads that

592.79 --> 601.4
never drink and they look old and they

596.06 --> 605.15
become like dude totally still man yeah

601.4 --> 607.55
that's nice or I guess to each their own

605.15 --> 612.11
I used to do that sometimes but it's

607.55 --> 613.76
just just get so dumb it's annoying but

612.11 --> 615.5600000000001
if you combine that at the same time

613.76 --> 618.35
we're the drink then you've got a

615.56 --> 620.0899999999999
problem because that's not a good

618.35 --> 622.5500000000001
combination so that's what I'm basically

620.09 --> 624.74
trying to point it and if you do both

622.55 --> 627.5
and be very careful maybe you could have

624.74 --> 630.65
like a glass of wine or something or a

627.5 --> 633.17
beer or maybe two and then with a joint

630.65 --> 637.04
and you smoke it very sparingly over

633.17 --> 639.5899999999999
time that kind of setup rarely ends up

637.04 --> 642.8
in like a bad trip or being very sick or

639.59 --> 645.5
something but just be very experiment if

642.8 --> 648.26
you are normally used to taking in a lot

645.5 --> 649.99
at times be very careful so that's some

648.26 --> 656.54
I guess

649.99 --> 662.66
drug advice from Arwen so

656.54 --> 662.66
Yeah right well to each their own

663.83 --> 670.0500000000001
alright moderation is normally the key

667.4 --> 673.05
but yeah some people can just like

670.05 --> 676.1099999999999
overdo it sometimes because they like me

673.05 --> 677.7299999999999
to break out that's like a cycle it's a

676.11 --> 680.76
psychosomatic thing and that kind of

677.73 --> 684.41
works sometimes or sometimes it always

680.76 --> 689.01
goes wrong as it depends per individual

684.41 --> 690.9499999999999
but don't do it something like that

689.01 --> 694.65
combining drugs basically and that's

690.95 --> 696.99
even any trucks really even if you also

694.65 --> 699.75
have like pills or something against

696.99 --> 701.01
pain and [ __ ] don't combine it what they

699.75 --> 705.27
even say that don't combine with

701.01 --> 710.28
drinking it's dangerous so like never

705.27 --> 713.61
combine serious influencers it's just a

710.28 --> 717.39
general advice that's really worth

713.61 --> 719.46
remembering because it's yeah it's not a

717.39 --> 721.62
joke it's not just some to

719.46 --> 724.19
overgeneralize thing it really is

721.62 --> 729.9
dangerous to combine drugs in general

724.19 --> 733.7700000000001
most of them it's rarely not dangerous

729.9 --> 735.87
and usually it is dangerous to combine

733.77 --> 741.26
drugs that's that's just how it goes

735.87 --> 741.26
that's how you should size it up so

744.67 --> 752.36
and to be fair it's best to just not

748.76 --> 756.62
take any drugs at all if yeah especially

752.36 --> 759.98
yeah like don't start if you don't feel

756.62 --> 762.29
like you yeah you don't wanna at least

759.98 --> 773.38
don't don't buy into peer pressure or

762.29 --> 777.41
something like that yeah I don't know I

773.38 --> 780.92
wouldn't say never try anything just be

777.41 --> 782.81
very aware of that especially the first

780.92 --> 785.24
time that almost anything you take can

782.81 --> 787.5699999999999
be very impactful and that will imprint

785.24 --> 790.52
on you that's how it works and that

787.57 --> 793.61
memory is gonna basically echo from

790.52 --> 797.48
there arm in that state that that

793.61 --> 799.76
certain drug rings it's very dependent

797.48 --> 802.4300000000001
on the association even off the first

799.76 --> 805.52
try there's a lot of cannabis users or

802.43 --> 808.2199999999999
well people that don't use cannabis like

805.52 --> 810.9499999999999
I guess I could give this for example my

808.22 --> 813.4100000000001
brother he did try it sometime and it

810.95 --> 816.86
just didn't feel right didn't hit right

813.41 --> 818.03
and he just didn't want to use it after

816.86 --> 821.87
that ever again

818.03 --> 826.6999999999999
and he didn't so and I've heard other

821.87 --> 830.42
stories like this so you can try stuff

826.7 --> 831.2
just be very careful with it don't fool

830.42 --> 838.0699999999999
around

831.2 --> 841.0300000000001
so yeah enough about that let's see what

838.07 --> 841.0300000000001
has been going on

851.939 --> 860.98
yeah mushroom man that technically

854.56 --> 866.6099999999999
correct yeah did even to those that

860.98 --> 870.029
don't smoke it's very worthwhile for

866.61 --> 873.069
nutraceutical reasons to look in still

870.029 --> 874.6
get involved with cannabis and you don't

873.069 --> 876.8499999999999
have to smoke it you can just get the

874.6 --> 880.749
cannabinoid extracts because they're

876.85 --> 884.589
very healthy your body has specific

880.749 --> 888.49
receptors for cannabinoids that serve a

884.589 --> 892.6600000000001
certain function that's very useful we

888.49 --> 895.72
are built to use it but when you smoke

892.66 --> 899.05
it you get more psychological yeah you

895.72 --> 902.8000000000001
get more experience impacts and less of

899.05 --> 908.62
the the cannabinoid effect much less of

902.8 --> 911.2589999999999
it really practically there are some but

908.62 --> 914.249
yeah there's just the other effect like

911.259 --> 918.66
the mental influence it has and your

914.249 --> 921.4300000000001
impulses and metabolic influences yeah

918.66 --> 924.04
it does have that as well especially

921.43 --> 926.949
when you smoke it it's very direct

924.04 --> 928.87
influences to most people at least to me

926.949 --> 934.99
it's very impactful influences every

928.87 --> 938.11
time I take it it's just I don't know

934.99 --> 941.439
maybe also a bit because of the tobacco

938.11 --> 943.87
because I do smoke it with tobacco so

941.439 --> 947.319
that makes the psychological impact a

943.87 --> 950.11
little bit less every time I don't it's

947.319 --> 952.209
like it hits me so hard like I've been

950.11 --> 954.639
smoking over half my life and still

952.209 --> 959.05
every time I smoke without tobacco it

954.639 --> 964.0
just bad and it just breaks me out of my

959.05 --> 966.899
control that is it I kind of lose grip

964.0 --> 966.899
it's not too good

974.06 --> 983.06
but yeah if you eat it or if you take

979.1 --> 991.99
the oil can have cannabinoid oil that is

983.06 --> 996.6099999999999
very good for for for example against no

991.99 --> 999.44
thing it works for is against epileptic

996.61 --> 1002.17
seizures it's amazing how that works

999.44 --> 1006.1
vaccine damage it restores it and it's

1002.17 --> 1008.38
also said officially it's supposedly not

1006.1 --> 1012.58
allowed to be declared that way but I'm

1008.38 --> 1017.02
pretty sure that it directly involves

1012.58 --> 1023.32
itself with cancer and makes the

1017.02 --> 1025.99
cannabinoids basically cause the the the

1023.32 --> 1028.63
really expanding cancer cells to

1025.99 --> 1032.56
basically shut down and even kill

1028.63 --> 1036.73
themselves to basically like realize

1032.56 --> 1038.56
like you are not you are not welcome

1036.73 --> 1043.72
here you're misbehaving

1038.56 --> 1046.6
now desist and that's what happens and

1043.72 --> 1049.75
there's plenty of people stories these

1046.6 --> 1051.37
stories go around a lot and I consider

1049.75 --> 1052.93
myself to be part of these stories

1051.37 --> 1056.26
because I think that I probably had

1052.93 --> 1058.21
cancer at some point it damn well felt

1056.26 --> 1066.46
like it it was very painful

1058.21 --> 1068.92
for a period and I cut did it wait yeah

1066.46 --> 1074.6200000000001
I wasn't smoking tobacco at that

1068.92 --> 1078.16
and I know it just went away because I

1074.62 --> 1080.29
kept on using cannabis carefully and I

1078.16 --> 1083.77
also said like yeah if I stop smoking

1080.29 --> 1085.48
cannabis right now I risk like dying it

1083.77 --> 1088.09
was so weird and it sounded like really

1085.48 --> 1091.3
crazy but it I felt like yeah I'm pretty

1088.09 --> 1093.34
sure that it it just feels like there's

1091.3 --> 1095.4099999999999
something really like I thought I might

1093.34 --> 1097.12
have lung cancer or something it

1095.41 --> 1100.03
wouldn't be surprised because I have

1097.12 --> 1102.34
been smoking tobacco not so carefully

1100.03 --> 1106.66
even especially the first half of my

1102.34 --> 1109.36
life like through paper tips and all

1106.66 --> 1111.3700000000001
that it's not good so it could happen

1109.36 --> 1116.26
especially under extremely stressful

1111.37 --> 1118.54
situations like I've been in but it went

1116.26 --> 1122.56
away again it's just it's like it's

1118.54 --> 1124.6299999999999
never been there but it is still like a

1122.56 --> 1127.54
critical mask mask

1124.63 --> 1130.71
risk thing like it could happen again if

1127.54 --> 1134.4099999999999
I like totally mentally implode heavily

1130.71 --> 1138.97
but I don't I anticipate that's not

1134.41 --> 1142.18
gonna be happening because I'm not gonna

1138.97 --> 1153.04
take that bigger emotional risks for a

1142.18 --> 1155.3200000000002
while or ever that caused that so but

1153.04 --> 1157.32
there are people again I'm wandering off

1155.32 --> 1160.12
in my storytelling sorry about that

1157.32 --> 1161.9199999999998
people have said and there's articles

1160.12 --> 1164.7099999999998
about this that yeah they've been

1161.92 --> 1167.8600000000001
diagnosed with some cancer they take

1164.71 --> 1173.53
cannabis oil or they or they combine it

1167.86 --> 1175.4199999999998
with with raw food for a period and then

1173.53 --> 1179.95
they get back to the doctor and it's

1175.42 --> 1182.95
gone it's like yeah it's gone or it's

1179.95 --> 1186.16
severely retreated and in like a healing

1182.95 --> 1190.0900000000001
stage that happens a lot so that's just

1186.16 --> 1193.5700000000002
a yeah whether medical science

1190.09 --> 1195.85
supposedly accepts it or not that is

1193.57 --> 1197.83
what happens because there's plenty of

1195.85 --> 1199.1299999999999
stories of people that have gone through

1197.83 --> 1201.6499999999999
that that have tests

1199.13 --> 1211.22
fight to that so yeah you got to take it

1201.65 --> 1213.98
for what it's worth but again that same

1211.22 --> 1216.49
effect is not achieved as much when you

1213.98 --> 1216.49
smoke it

1220.74 --> 1229.59
and smoking it does not take away a risk

1226.89 --> 1231.5
of cancer just by itself and I have an

1229.59 --> 1235.11
example of that and that was my mother

1231.5 --> 1241.169
because my mother did smell cannabis

1235.11 --> 1244.4399999999998
pure didn't even smoke tobacco and yeah

1241.169 --> 1248.5800000000002
since since I started smoking pretty

1244.44 --> 1250.5
much so since 95 roughly I started

1248.58 --> 1252.3899999999999
experimenting with some friends and they

1250.5 --> 1253.89
were like not very trustworthy and my

1252.39 --> 1256.529
parents took note of that and then they

1253.89 --> 1257.19
said okay look we are actually kind of

1256.529 --> 1259.71
hippies

1257.19 --> 1262.6490000000001
we have cannabis so we're smoking it

1259.71 --> 1264.57
we've been doing it in secret you can

1262.649 --> 1267.09
join us and take with us and that way

1264.57 --> 1269.6399999999999
we'll we can make sure you don't end up

1267.09 --> 1271.9189999999999
with some freaks in some crack house or

1269.64 --> 1275.279
something and guess what the guy that

1271.919 --> 1277.8600000000001
originally went experiment with cannabis

1275.279 --> 1281.37
with actually end up in a freakin crack

1277.86 --> 1284.1299999999999
house that was insane he did get out of

1281.37 --> 1286.08
it like through Scientology or something

1284.13 --> 1288.3600000000001
that's what I heard later but it's so

1286.08 --> 1290.52
weird that that literally happened to

1288.36 --> 1292.1689999999999
that friend of mine and I could have

1290.52 --> 1296.299
probably ended up there too or or I

1292.169 --> 1296.2990000000002
might not have because it was just -

1297.44 --> 1304.76
yeah how that is it's just - - away from

1301.47 --> 1307.559
the self it's - - denialist

1304.76 --> 1309.779
to be on that level and I couldn't do

1307.559 --> 1311.7
that I was interested in stuff but I I

1309.779 --> 1313.789
didn't like the negative sides of that

1311.7 --> 1317.5800000000002
guy kind of hoped that he would

1313.789 --> 1319.77
certainly get over that but and if I

1317.58 --> 1324.75
think eventually he did last time I saw

1319.77 --> 1328.429
me was very changed it was a he was much

1324.75 --> 1328.429
more adult that was good

1329.11 --> 1333.1
Karen what are you doing

1336.51 --> 1345.54
what's going on okay stop stop poking

1341.7 --> 1348.75
Karen and Karen please just try to

1345.54 --> 1352.6399999999999
ignore the idiots don't don't get poked

1348.75 --> 1352.64
don't control poked please Oh

1353.429 --> 1359.13
so what sinkhole he calls on everything

1355.679 --> 1364.1100000000001
a concave for he is like PJ a calling

1359.13 --> 1366.7800000000002
everything Aristarchus okay seriously

1364.11 --> 1369.9799999999998
Jason McCormack comes to my hangout like

1366.78 --> 1372.45
almost every day now and just caps posts

1369.98 --> 1375.21
constantly like earth is concave

1372.45 --> 1378.059
everyone conk he is like our restorer

1375.21 --> 1381.6000000000001
kissing it with the concave thing so you

1378.059 --> 1385.32
shouldn't even take that that serious no

1381.6 --> 1388.6789999999999
he's just a weirdo he's a devout

1385.32 --> 1391.559
religious concave her and he's harmless

1388.679 --> 1393.8090000000002
so just don't don't be trolled don't

1391.559 --> 1394.26
need to timeout people that'll just make

1393.809 --> 1398.19
things worse

1394.26 --> 1400.8799999999999
please so let me get back to what I was

1398.19 --> 1406.23
talking about I'm totally distracted

1400.88 --> 1407.88
right 15 I was smoking cannabis back

1406.23 --> 1411.27
then and it was giving my mother as an

1407.88 --> 1413.7
example for how it can go you definitely

1411.27 --> 1416.94
can die of cancer while smoking cannabis

1413.7 --> 1420.0
but why was that because my mother had a

1416.94 --> 1422.73
lot of physical issues and I think I

1420.0 --> 1424.58
inherited some of it so did my brother

1422.73 --> 1427.65
definitely and

1424.58 --> 1430.9189999999999
in me it expressed itself in skin issues

1427.65 --> 1435.23
very typical we have we're more sent my

1430.919 --> 1439.0490000000002
mother was very sensitive to allergy and

1435.23 --> 1441.3600000000001
she was totally over agitated about

1439.049 --> 1444.36
anything that put like this tractor so

1441.36 --> 1447.1499999999999
it just would like drive her nuts or a

1444.36 --> 1449.6399999999999
big being runny nose was like really

1447.15 --> 1451.3500000000001
really piss her off there was something

1449.64 --> 1454.26
weird so she just wanted all the

1451.35 --> 1456.3899999999999
symptoms away completely and because of

1454.26 --> 1459.95
this she went to the doctor and just got

1456.39 --> 1462.7800000000002
anti-allergy like attacked the allergy

1459.95 --> 1464.76
but that resulted in her taking lots of

1462.78 --> 1467.8799999999999
pharmaceuticals that changed her

1464.76 --> 1469.029
behavior like even like this she got

1467.88 --> 1471.909
Zyrtec

1469.029 --> 1473.889
and it's known to have like severe mood

1471.909 --> 1477.519
altered like makes you want to attack

1473.889 --> 1479.4089999999999
people it's crazy and we had all kinds

1477.519 --> 1482.319
of crazy problems because of that with

1479.409 --> 1485.979
my mother and she well eventually got

1482.319 --> 1489.879
cancer pretty severely through little

1485.979 --> 1491.709
crazy situating and not physically but

1489.879 --> 1493.839
just constantly mentally fighting at

1491.709 --> 1495.429
home and yelling with my dad and me and

1493.839 --> 1499.059
just crazy

1495.429 --> 1501.1290000000001
annoying bad situations yeah that

1499.059 --> 1502.989
stresses you the [ __ ] out and then if

1501.129 --> 1505.089
you have all these chemicals in your

1502.989 --> 1507.219
body yeah you can smoke a bit of

1505.089 --> 1507.759
cannabis but you're still gonna get

1507.219 --> 1510.729
cancer

1507.759 --> 1513.219
from just the the overkill of it

1510.729 --> 1515.559
cannabis might relieve some of it but it

1513.219 --> 1518.049
can also backfire because it's all just

1515.559 --> 1520.1789999999999
too much and it was all just too much

1518.049 --> 1522.819
with my mother because that crazy home

1520.179 --> 1528.5790000000002
situation happened and she was like over

1522.819 --> 1532.389
her head in work at the conservatory

1528.579 --> 1535.869
being a musician teacher and exam guide

1532.389 --> 1537.519
and having piles and piles of work with

1535.869 --> 1539.7389999999998
that console she was just totally in

1537.519 --> 1543.279
over her head with everything and she

1539.739 --> 1547.479
just snapped stressed out and got cancer

1543.279 --> 1550.449
I think and the cannabis didn't help

1547.479 --> 1554.039
that she kept on smoking until she

1550.449 --> 1557.049
basically couldn't move anymore and yeah

1554.039 --> 1562.439
didn't help and for so it it's not a

1557.049 --> 1565.059
guarantee you have to not do the crap

1562.439 --> 1566.799
it's not like the miracle cure you like

1565.059 --> 1568.629
go on doing whatever you want and then

1566.799 --> 1572.649
you smoke a bit of cannabis or you do

1568.629 --> 1575.859
that regularly and then goes away no you

1572.649 --> 1578.1589999999999
have to combine it you have to adapt

1575.859 --> 1580.149
your diet you have to get away from

1578.159 --> 1586.239
pharmaceuticals and replace them with

1580.149 --> 1589.4089999999999
more natural herb approaches the same

1586.239 --> 1593.8790000000001
thing I really start to become your own

1589.409 --> 1596.5890000000002
medical manager managing your own body

1593.879 --> 1601.539
being a caretaker for your own health

1596.589 --> 1602.83
and then cannabis can absolutely help

1601.539 --> 1608.4089999999999
fix you with

1602.83 --> 1610.269
any issue you have or a lot of them but

1608.409 --> 1612.7
you had the problem is most people that

1610.269 --> 1616.659
I bump into that have like severe

1612.7 --> 1622.57
medical issues it's not a starting thing

1616.659 --> 1625.5390000000002
it came from 20 years of doctor stuff

1622.57 --> 1628.1399999999999
medical stuff accidents and then it just

1625.539 --> 1631.21
piles up and it becomes out of control

1628.14 --> 1634.0
there's almost nothing like these people

1631.21 --> 1636.519
talk to me like explain it and I'm just

1634.0 --> 1638.2
like [ __ ] I really don't know what to do

1636.519 --> 1641.799
about it because it's so out it's so

1638.2 --> 1644.2
many things you can't just say okay you

1641.799 --> 1647.34
stop this you stop that and you quickly

1644.2 --> 1652.1490000000001
transit to this no it's too difficult

1647.34 --> 1655.149
it's very sad every time I see that you

1652.149 --> 1658.539
have to start early that's why it's so

1655.149 --> 1661.1689999999999
important that young people realize this

1658.539 --> 1664.45
at a young age you have to take care of

1661.169 --> 1667.419
your own health you have to understand

1664.45 --> 1671.409
it and not just believe what you're

1667.419 --> 1676.48
taught you have to really get it and if

1671.409 --> 1679.3890000000001
you have some wise aunt or your mother

1676.48 --> 1682.3600000000001
perhaps or maybe even an uncle or

1679.389 --> 1685.86
something maybe your dad is just really

1682.36 --> 1688.809
good with health then listen to them

1685.86 --> 1690.85
don't you don't have to necessarily take

1688.809 --> 1692.35
everything for granted outright there

1690.85 --> 1694.0
may be some weird stuff in there you

1692.35 --> 1698.9089999999999
don't you never really know what people

1694.0 --> 1704.049
adapt in their own routines but listen

1698.909 --> 1708.1000000000001
compare it and try stuff out carefully

1704.049 --> 1709.929
and read it read up on it it can be very

1708.1 --> 1711.9399999999998
difficult to get through it especially

1709.929 --> 1713.8600000000001
when you're starting because yeah the

1711.94 --> 1716.799
algorithms for Google and everything

1713.86 --> 1719.9799999999998
will absolutely discourage you at first

1716.799 --> 1723.07
with anything new you might be figure

1719.98 --> 1726.1
yeah you might want to try out so don't

1723.07 --> 1728.35
be fooled by the first search results

1726.1 --> 1731.279
you really got to make up your mind that

1728.35 --> 1731.279
you want to try something

1732.41 --> 1739.91
and then after you find other people

1735.59 --> 1743.53
that do that and then eventually you

1739.91 --> 1747.38
will learn about it you will become

1743.53 --> 1749.12
somebody that can advise get yeah give

1747.38 --> 1752.3600000000001
that as an option like maybe you could

1749.12 --> 1754.9399999999998
try this and a lot of flat-earthers here

1752.36 --> 1756.86
that I know do this they have a vast

1754.94 --> 1760.8400000000001
library of knowledge which they can

1756.86 --> 1763.2199999999998
apply and I treasure that knowledge

1760.84 --> 1765.1399999999999
above a lot of things it's very

1763.22 --> 1767.1200000000001
important to me that I don't forget it

1765.14 --> 1768.6200000000001
and that's why it's also important to

1767.12 --> 1772.07
keep on talking about it because that

1768.62 --> 1775.76
way it becomes ingrained and it will

1772.07 --> 1777.95
more naturally come come afloat in

1775.76 --> 1780.44
conversation every time without you

1777.95 --> 1785.049
having to look it up in a book somewhere

1780.44 --> 1785.049
or you know

1791.16 --> 1795.03
that's a rambling

1803.39 --> 1810.8300000000002
ah well clean you might want to look up

1807.35 --> 1814.58
on the studies of GMO there are certain

1810.83 --> 1818.72
rats in France that were fed pure GMO

1814.58 --> 1818.99
diets and they totally got cancer from

1818.72 --> 1822.2
it

1818.99 --> 1827.21
almost every no not every single one of

1822.2 --> 1830.51
them very visible very destructive

1827.21 --> 1832.97
cancers so yeah you can definitely get

1830.51 --> 1835.52
cancer from eating it all depends what

1832.97 --> 1840.02
you're eating you can't get it from

1835.52 --> 1841.58
organic food or well from wholesome and

1840.02 --> 1846.559
poisoned food let's just say it like

1841.58 --> 1850.61
that but there's definitely plenty of

1846.559 --> 1857.3899999999999
things that can be in food that can that

1850.61 --> 1859.549
can cause cancer and it's usually not

1857.39 --> 1862.1000000000001
the things that are talked about in the

1859.549 --> 1865.85
mainstream because they then suggest

1862.1 --> 1868.3999999999999
like oh if you take too much of this too

1865.85 --> 1870.74
much of that regular type of food that's

1868.4 --> 1873.2900000000002
dangerous or something that's typically

1870.74 --> 1875.09
the narrative for the mainstream they

1873.29 --> 1877.07
don't tell you is that that is pretty

1875.09 --> 1880.04
much nonsense and it's more about

1877.07 --> 1882.98
whatever is in that specific type of

1880.04 --> 1886.1599999999999
food because their statistical analysis

1882.98 --> 1888.5
is based their opinions are based on

1886.16 --> 1890.78
that statistical analysis of just people

1888.5 --> 1893.75
taking it it's not focused on what is in

1890.78 --> 1895.76
it not really

1893.75 --> 1899.059
that's the sneaky part about it that's

1895.76 --> 1903.37
the myth that's the deception so you got

1899.059 --> 1905.6
to be very careful in taking information

1903.37 --> 1908.26
you've got to figure out how they

1905.6 --> 1908.26
derived it

1916.009 --> 1926.249
okay that is ridiculous look I am mr.

1919.47 --> 1929.249
panda bear all GMOs are bad it's that's

1926.249 --> 1931.71
just a given but in this case

1929.249 --> 1938.249
specifically when I talk about GMOs I'm

1931.71 --> 1941.6000000000001
talking about the Monsanto type of GMO

1938.249 --> 1945.8600000000001
crops because those crops were not

1941.6 --> 1949.07
finally genetically tinkered they were

1945.86 --> 1953.6689999999999
created with the gene gun technology

1949.07 --> 1955.86
which just disrupts genetics causes

1953.669 --> 1958.499
unexpected side effects and they just

1955.86 --> 1961.4289999999999
then pick a certain unexpected side

1958.499 --> 1964.23
effect that just seems on the surface to

1961.429 --> 1966.3890000000001
have the right thing that they want

1964.23 --> 1970.08
that's how they did it very chaotic very

1966.389 --> 1972.6
disruptive every time and that is always

1970.08 --> 1975.6899999999998
bad because everything about that type

1972.6 --> 1978.9599999999998
of food is genetically mutated severely

1975.69 --> 1981.45
in unexpected ways and results in

1978.96 --> 1984.779
horrifying side effects which have been

1981.45 --> 1990.96
recorded like dead born calves that had

1984.779 --> 1993.48
weird living entities in them micro

1990.96 --> 1996.48
entities that were just unidentified

1993.48 --> 1999.179
made of a substance that just defied

1996.48 --> 1999.779
normal organic it was so creepy and

1999.179 --> 2003.049
crazy

1999.779 --> 2005.299
so yeah genetically modified organisms

2003.049 --> 2008.749
like that the old-fashioned way from the

2005.299 --> 2010.85
90s yeah it's always bad but yeah

2008.749 --> 2012.919
genetic modification has moved on

2010.85 --> 2016.1589999999999
someone's become more like tinkering and

2012.919 --> 2019.1000000000001
I don't really know what the results of

2016.159 --> 2021.3200000000002
that are though depends on the design

2019.1 --> 2024.83
Monsanto still sucks because they design

2021.32 --> 2026.9289999999999
their crops surrounding the immunity to

2024.83 --> 2029.809
that poison that they want to use that's

2026.929 --> 2035.3600000000001
that's the worst thing about it pretty

2029.809 --> 2038.149
much so I don't know it depends on the

2035.36 --> 2040.7589999999998
nature of the genetic modification look

2038.149 --> 2042.559
technically crossbreeding is genetic

2040.759 --> 2043.79
modification as well but it's using

2042.559 --> 2047.54
crossbreeding

2043.79 --> 2052.82
and that's a natural a relatively

2047.54 --> 2054.8
natural thing it's it can turn out to be

2052.82 --> 2057.71
like when you come when you strike to

2054.8 --> 2061.429
crossbreed fruits it's also just like

2057.71 --> 2065.45
with the gene gun random result although

2061.429 --> 2067.58
usually a bit more narrow but it's very

2065.45 --> 2069.7999999999997
unlikely to have very damaging side

2067.58 --> 2071.87
effects and if it does it's like okay

2069.8 --> 2076.69
the fruit that came out of this crossing

2071.87 --> 2078.95
just happens to become sour or something

2076.69 --> 2080.899
but it's never like oh yeah this just

2078.95 --> 2083.0
tastes great and then after a while like

2080.899 --> 2086.2999999999997
oh my god all these people are poisoned

2083.0 --> 2090.29
that just never happens with

2086.3 --> 2092.36
crossbreeding and with when you cross

2090.29 --> 2093.98
breed animals that really never happens

2092.36 --> 2096.23
either the worst that can happen is that

2093.98 --> 2100.1
a creature do it that it doesn't work or

2096.23 --> 2103.0
that it becomes sterile or something but

2100.1 --> 2107.24
when you use gene guns that just totally

2103.0 --> 2108.89
fractures the genetic blueprint of the

2107.24 --> 2112.9599999999996
organism which can have extremely

2108.89 --> 2112.96
unexpected side effects on the long run

2112.99 --> 2118.0299999999997
so that's my take on genetic

2115.34 --> 2118.03
modification

2122.38 --> 2129.609
right well truth is truth what you're

2126.7 --> 2132.1299999999997
talking about is not specifically about

2129.609 --> 2134.619
a genetic modification okay other

2132.13 --> 2136.989
genetic modified crops are usually very

2134.619 --> 2139.869
monoculture but what you're talking

2136.989 --> 2142.9
about is just cloning which can be done

2139.869 --> 2145.4790000000003
with plants and yeah cloned plants all

2142.9 --> 2147.7000000000003
risk if there's a disease that would

2145.479 --> 2149.049
catch on to that specific plant is very

2147.7 --> 2151.18
likely that it would spread like a

2149.049 --> 2152.71
wildfire and immediately infect almost

2151.18 --> 2155.19
everything that's the danger of

2152.71 --> 2158.71
monoculture but that's not genetic

2155.19 --> 2161.859
modification related specifically based

2158.71 --> 2163.809
on plants and on the potential cloning

2161.859 --> 2166.359
of animals which became an issue in

2163.809 --> 2168.099
cloning for like dolly the cloned sheep

2166.359 --> 2170.95
and everything when that became an issue

2168.099 --> 2173.6800000000003
like are we going to do that well no I

2170.95 --> 2179.4399999999996
wouldn't recommend it but maybe it is

2173.68 --> 2181.21
kind of used but with plants that's much

2179.44 --> 2186.94
older issue that's where it first

2181.21 --> 2190.719
arrived because cloning plants is very

2186.94 --> 2194.41
easy they figured that out very early on

2190.719 --> 2199.66
I think so it was just an option to do

2194.41 --> 2207.19
that and all depends I don't know anyway

2199.66 --> 2208.8999999999996
I am open for guests right away so if

2207.19 --> 2211.739
anybody would like to join me they can

2208.9 --> 2211.739
call me on skype

2220.079 --> 2229.21
hmm right yeah truth is truth that's

2223.0 --> 2230.829
also true a monoculture farming has

2229.21 --> 2234.609
several issues and that is something

2230.829 --> 2237.13
that the organic farming system that

2234.609 --> 2239.71
culture that group of people that learn

2237.13 --> 2242.2200000000003
about how to do that effectively they

2239.71 --> 2247.23
they tackled that and they figured out

2242.22 --> 2250.27
how to basically combine unique plants

2247.23 --> 2251.829
with each other bring them in each

2250.27 --> 2256.57
other's vicinity because they actually

2251.829 --> 2260.6800000000003
enhance each other's quality and that's

2256.57 --> 2262.7200000000003
this like a separate empirical science

2260.68 --> 2265.8689999999997
of its own it's very amazing how that

2262.72 --> 2269.56
works and there are some people that

2265.869 --> 2271.78
specialized in this and it's even in

2269.56 --> 2273.19
Europe as far as I know or in the

2271.78 --> 2277.8390000000004
Netherlands there's like a separate

2273.19 --> 2279.79
grade above regular organic brand when

2277.839 --> 2282.7
that type of farming is applied and it's

2279.79 --> 2288.13
called Demeter it's basically named

2282.7 --> 2291.0989999999997
after after the Greek god of Agriculture

2288.13 --> 2294.6400000000003
very typical but that's like special

2291.099 --> 2297.28
types of farms where it's like amazing

2294.64 --> 2301.24
you have like trees certain types and

2297.28 --> 2303.55
and plants and then usually like goats

2301.24 --> 2306.0099999999998
or something walk in between everything

2303.55 --> 2308.71
is combined they're in a natural way

2306.01 --> 2314.3190000000004
it's amazing how that works very

2308.71 --> 2316.7200000000003
fascinating and it yields yeah the best

2314.319 --> 2319.869
type of quality of everything best type

2316.72 --> 2322.48
of fruits the best type of crops and the

2319.869 --> 2324.4900000000002
best type of meat as well because that

2322.48 --> 2329.2
also accounts for the animals that are

2324.49 --> 2331.27
part of that that type of form and milk

2329.2 --> 2334.75
by the way also so it counts for

2331.27 --> 2336.97
everything about farming you can combine

2334.75 --> 2341.71
things make it more natural give them

2336.97 --> 2343.72
all more yes make all things more feel

2341.71 --> 2347.069
like they're natural in a natural

2343.72 --> 2350.8489999999997
environment instead of just a a

2347.069 --> 2352.97
monoculture like uniform setup which is

2350.849 --> 2356.569
natural to plants

2352.97 --> 2364.04
really just like it's a natural to

2356.569 --> 2368.9
humans even though it may be very

2364.04 --> 2372.5299999999997
efficient but anyway it's it's basically

2368.9 --> 2374.1800000000003
saying it's honoring logos like making

2372.53 --> 2378.4700000000003
all these creatures or everything

2374.18 --> 2383.75
involved in a form live a more natural

2378.47 --> 2386.06
life and healthy and that yes yeah more

2383.75 --> 2389.349
logos in farming means more logos in

2386.06 --> 2389.349
food it's very simple

2418.83 --> 2421.83
so

2430.58 --> 2436.2999999999997
let's see what else can I talk about

2437.89 --> 2446.5499999999997
[Music]

2440.04 --> 2446.55
the Bates was their kind of typical

2451.84 --> 2458.73
oh yeah that was right it was this

2455.11 --> 2463.0
pretty I forgot it's two days ago even

2458.73 --> 2468.73
was yeah I noticed a live stream from

2463.0 --> 2473.2
Jesse spots and he was on air life and

2468.73 --> 2476.23
talking to his dad yeah basically having

2473.2 --> 2477.5699999999997
a family Flat Earth versus global

2476.23 --> 2480.34
discussion

2477.57 --> 2482.65
well not like with the Glovers but with

2480.34 --> 2487.36
his dad was really direct it was pretty

2482.65 --> 2488.11
damn intense spectacular so that was

2487.36 --> 2492.94
interesting

2488.11 --> 2498.27
Jesse spots I'll put a link to that

2492.94 --> 2503.92
video in the description it's 55 minutes

2498.27 --> 2509.73
yeah was really interesting so take a

2503.92 --> 2509.73
look at it after this or somewhere else

2510.51 --> 2514.8900000000003
alright what else is going on

2526.67 --> 2529.27
all right

2547.48 --> 2550.17
yeah

2550.61 --> 2554.4
yeah there's lots I could talk I could

2552.87 --> 2558.1099999999997
get into politics for a bit because

2554.4 --> 2558.11
there seems to be a lot happening there

2559.43 --> 2570.66
it's just not very nice stuff like it

2565.2 --> 2573.8999999999996
seems like Trump is really pushing like

2570.66 --> 2576.29
he's like beating war drums technically

2573.9 --> 2580.34
and he's doing it through Twitter and

2576.29 --> 2584.4
before it would be like a bit like

2580.34 --> 2588.3900000000003
negotiations but it seems I don't know

2584.4 --> 2591.03
is it is it that is he just trying to

2588.39 --> 2593.67
push the whole place and for certain

2591.03 --> 2597.3
type of deals and everything or is he

2593.67 --> 2604.35
actually gonna get into war over there

2597.3 --> 2609.75
that will be crazy and I think he might

2604.35 --> 2612.72
it's yeah in my visions even you know

2609.75 --> 2614.97
it's like I I pretty much saw very

2612.72 --> 2616.5
detailed things about that so I predict

2614.97 --> 2621.0899999999997
that it might actually happen that makes

2616.5 --> 2622.62
me feel uncomfortable because like a lot

2621.09 --> 2624.98
of chaotic things happen after that

2622.62 --> 2624.98
point

2635.37 --> 2641.5499999999997
but I don't know I don't know how if

2639.42 --> 2644.9700000000003
it's just gonna be more tensions and

2641.55 --> 2648.42
more flexing muscles or if it's like

2644.97 --> 2651.27
really gonna destroy a lot a lot of

2648.42 --> 2655.86
things I don't know it it will

2651.27 --> 2660.38
definitely cause more more chaos on

2655.86 --> 2662.79
average like it will up the pressure

2660.38 --> 2667.9100000000003
that is what is going to happen I'm

2662.79 --> 2667.91
pretty sure of that so yeah we'll see

2685.93 --> 2695.5899999999997
hmm okay I am mr. panda bear what is

2691.87 --> 2698.98
logos I have a definition my head but

2695.59 --> 2701.29
I'm not sure it matches well logos I

2698.98 --> 2703.2400000000002
basically derived it from Owen Benjamin

2701.29 --> 2710.94
that started talking about it and it

2703.24 --> 2716.58
references certain philosophy I think

2710.94 --> 2719.44
north yeah and it it basically says that

2716.58 --> 2724.0
everything is pretty much designed by

2719.44 --> 2726.79
the creator and he has a path for set

2724.0 --> 2729.82
for everyone which is the optimal which

2726.79 --> 2732.64
yields the optimal result noticeably and

2729.82 --> 2735.25
physically and if you follow that then

2732.64 --> 2738.43
you follow logos and logos can be

2735.25 --> 2740.89
clearly their synchronicities with a lot

2738.43 --> 2743.6499999999996
of people just certain time doing

2740.89 --> 2748.21
certain type of things has benefits for

2743.65 --> 2750.58
that person it will help you retain your

2748.21 --> 2752.8
stability give you more energy give you

2750.58 --> 2754.5699999999997
more growth give you more depth of

2752.8 --> 2757.6000000000004
insight give you more wisdom all these

2754.57 --> 2759.94
things in one way or another will

2757.6 --> 2761.89
increase thanks to logos but if you do

2759.94 --> 2768.27
something that is not love us the

2761.89 --> 2768.27
opposite will happen so that is logos

2770.549 --> 2777.64
and it is originally basically

2774.7 --> 2780.97
extrapolated back to the biblical angle

2777.64 --> 2784.9
of it I take it more in a colloquial

2780.97 --> 2788.2889999999998
sense but there there are just things

2784.9 --> 2790.6600000000003
that whatever opinion you have about it

2788.289 --> 2793.8900000000003
there's just some some feeling to it and

2790.66 --> 2796.45
that is really where a lot of

2793.89 --> 2800.5299999999997
information is derived from concerning

2796.45 --> 2803.2599999999998
logos as far as I'm concerned you just

2800.53 --> 2805.27
sense it like this principle this thing

2803.26 --> 2808.0890000000004
or this act or this attitude is just

2805.27 --> 2812.77
it's either good or it's not good and

2808.089 --> 2817.45
you can then pinpoint why where it's

2812.77 --> 2821.319
going and that makes it yeah it's it's

2817.45 --> 2831.16
energetic also in a way so the logos is

2821.319 --> 2833.38
a PSYOP well it can be definitely you

2831.16 --> 2836.22
can lose use logos as a sign up to

2833.38 --> 2840.549
enhance everyone against some political

2836.22 --> 2844.3489999999997
opposition or you could derail logos to

2840.549 --> 2847.869
basically break down and logos upholding

2844.349 --> 2852.19
community so yeah that it's it's another

2847.869 --> 2855.299
way of defining how these things works

2852.19 --> 2855.299
are these systems work

2863.0 --> 2869.77
all right well I think bill gee you're

2865.37 --> 2869.77
mistaking logos for Legos in this case

2881.45 --> 2892.47
okay P Morris well yeah that makes sense

2884.31 --> 2894.75
as well you can't steal logos you can

2892.47 --> 2895.3799999999997
make people abandon logos but you can't

2894.75 --> 2897.96
steal it

2895.38 --> 2900.27
because it is there it is the function

2897.96 --> 2902.1
of all things it is in the design and

2900.27 --> 2904.68
you either go with it or you don't and

2902.1 --> 2907.14
that's pretty much going with God or

2904.68 --> 2913.14
against it that's what it comes down to

2907.14 --> 2916.2
and it's not all so drastic as people

2913.14 --> 2918.48
tend to think it is but the consequences

2916.2 --> 2920.7599999999998
of everything is there and any

2918.48 --> 2924.0
misconceptions you may have will

2920.76 --> 2927.09
eventually be corrected or you'll just

2924.0 --> 2929.13
be totally stubborn and crazy and

2927.09 --> 2932.4500000000003
noticeably so with side effects because

2929.13 --> 2932.4500000000003
that is also not logos

2943.25 --> 2957.539
hey yeah let's see Oh Nathan's open up

2949.859 --> 2963.24
the panel already I guess it's not gonna

2957.539 --> 2966.21
be a panel today well I'm fine it's nice

2963.24 --> 2969.99
and calm and that Tamera coffee really

2966.21 --> 2973.309
hit the spot it's so weird it's like

2969.99 --> 2975.6899999999996
it's just not the coffee that I know

2973.309 --> 2977.9100000000003
it's always like coffee yeah I get a

2975.69 --> 2979.92
kick out of it and but then afterwards

2977.91 --> 2981.75
always not really that good so I have to

2979.92 --> 2984.7200000000003
be careful and now it's like okay - Mara

2981.75 --> 2987.869
coffee and I feel great

2984.72 --> 2989.7
no negative side effects except for if I

2987.869 --> 2994.349
drink it too much then I'll be up all

2989.7 --> 3000.3489999999997
night so right I guess that this

2994.349 --> 3001.1800000000003
advantage of coffee is now solved it's

3000.349 --> 3004.31
amazing

3001.18 --> 3004.31
[Music]

3011.35 --> 3013.86
yeah

3026.349 --> 3033.539
right well I am mr. panda bear that also

3030.119 --> 3037.2690000000002
is part of it

3033.539 --> 3039.67
look logos is not a very narrow thing it

3037.269 --> 3045.2189999999996
is not some kind of variable in a math

3039.67 --> 3047.589
equation it is a wider complex thing

3045.219 --> 3053.16
that definitely does not fall under

3047.589 --> 3057.099
science it's all too too complex and

3053.16 --> 3059.529
spiritual in nature not so tangible but

3057.099 --> 3061.9790000000003
with tangible results but it's still

3059.529 --> 3064.539
metaphorical and complex are basically

3061.979 --> 3068.499
interpretable in a multi-dimensional way

3064.539 --> 3089.619
in a in a trance chronic way it's yeah

3068.499 --> 3096.729
that's part of it shut up Brenda yes

3089.619 --> 3097.839
trance trance chronic that means not

3096.729 --> 3101.499
bound by time

3097.839 --> 3107.2889999999998
that's transcurrent chronic are we

3101.499 --> 3109.779
transcribe asically not trance Kronos

3107.289 --> 3113.0190000000002
trance chronic and maybe that's not an

3109.779 --> 3117.699
appropriate use of the word Kronos but

3113.019 --> 3120.6699999999996
it's basically trance grown us so it

3117.699 --> 3127.289
translates time it's it's not bound by

3120.67 --> 3131.489
regular time so how it functions is

3127.289 --> 3131.489
woven throughout time

3143.45 --> 3152.5099999999998
no not Tran scroll Nick that would

3146.9 --> 3155.17
definitely not know time is not really a

3152.51 --> 3155.17
dimension

3162.41 --> 3168.23
but I do still classify it as the fourth

3166.91 --> 3175.22
dimension even though it's not really

3168.23 --> 3178.42
related to the to the geometrical

3175.22 --> 3178.4199999999996
dimensions as it were

3194.41 --> 3200.5099999999998
right yeah by the way I did have a quite

3197.57 --> 3203.7400000000002
a few new subscribers recently so thanks

3200.51 --> 3206.69
everyone that has been subscribing I

3203.74 --> 3209.45
hope you find this channel interesting I

3206.69 --> 3211.88
do have some long pauses sometimes when

3209.45 --> 3214.3399999999997
I just scan through the chat and you'll

3211.88 --> 3220.82
be able to see it because it is in the

3214.34 --> 3223.9100000000003
actual video to the left and I do take

3220.82 --> 3227.4100000000003
guests but yeah not everyone is always

3223.91 --> 3227.41
in the mood for that and I get that

3233.2 --> 3241.5499999999997
whatever happened to Ellen B I don't

3235.55 --> 3243.3500000000004
know maybe he just got bored or didn't

3241.55 --> 3246.05
like it anymore or he found some other

3243.35 --> 3248.75
group to be weird and mysterious and an

3246.05 --> 3250.9
actor with I don't know what happened to

3248.75 --> 3250.9
him

3268.2 --> 3271.23
shut up

3280.91 --> 3287.69
I really did how they get destroyed I

3283.7 --> 3293.45
don't know how she doesn't really look

3287.69 --> 3297.29
he's just neutral you know he's he sites

3293.45 --> 3299.39
with the ballers but not really because

3297.29 --> 3301.58
he can definitely he knows what it is to

3299.39 --> 3304.58
be a flat earther so he's just trying to

3301.58 --> 3307.5499999999997
stay neutral and goes in every direction

3304.58 --> 3311.5099999999998
and he knows how to get grilled and not

3307.55 --> 3314.21
really do anything about it so I don't

3311.51 --> 3317.17
know was he destroyed really have you

3314.21 --> 3320.17
ever seen him go completely nuts I

3317.17 --> 3320.17
haven't

3334.22 --> 3336.97
okay

3338.07 --> 3343.9700000000003
was it that bad Jose what happened

3353.69 --> 3356.69
right

3361.38 --> 3364.8900000000003
piss off

3367.53 --> 3376.44
the earth is not a globe of the

3372.02 --> 3382.41
presupposed sighs get over it it's never

3376.44 --> 3385.08
going to be that can be that it may seem

3382.41 --> 3386.7599999999998
geometrically to be that if you

3385.08 --> 3391.02
presuppose everything that they force

3386.76 --> 3392.3100000000004
you to but the actual physics doesn't

3391.02 --> 3396.09
work out with it at all

3392.31 --> 3398.22
it can never be that you have to get

3396.09 --> 3400.8900000000003
over it you know if you want a globe you

3398.22 --> 3404.3399999999997
want some kind of globe well you might

3400.89 --> 3406.5
have this giant weird giant globe

3404.34 --> 3410.7000000000003
eventually of which the earth continents

3406.5 --> 3413.16
may be a part who knows might be like a

3410.7 --> 3415.2599999999998
little dot on that giant ball who knows

3413.16 --> 3419.22
and you'll have a ball after all but I

3415.26 --> 3421.32
highly doubt it really so it's

3419.22 --> 3424.41
definitely that not that small

3421.32 --> 3428.69
supposedly earth sized ball that they

3424.41 --> 3428.69
presuppose it is sorry

3439.35 --> 3442.31
mm-hmm

3443.03 --> 3446.0800000000004
anyone else

3452.259 --> 3459.349
L&B turn to dust when Thanos snaps

3455.589 --> 3461.68
that's a good one that's a Larry's bill

3459.349 --> 3461.6800000000003
gee

3470.14 --> 3472.769
all right

3473.24 --> 3481.47
well Jose to be fair I don't really

3476.46 --> 3484.56
watch most of your videos sometimes I

3481.47 --> 3488.0299999999997
feel like it when I feel like smacking

3484.56 --> 3490.35
some ballers or getting into vast

3488.03 --> 3492.1200000000003
presuppositional discussions which I can

3490.35 --> 3494.42
very good at that

3492.12 --> 3497.6099999999997
you might have taken out of it but

3494.42 --> 3501.2400000000002
usually it's just like I'm not really

3497.61 --> 3506.03
ready to watch on that arrogant circle

3501.24 --> 3508.6499999999996
jerk of George netting you can Shawn and

3506.03 --> 3512.0400000000004
rumpus and all that [ __ ] combined it's

3508.65 --> 3514.8
just it's not pleasurable it's not

3512.04 --> 3524.13
something that I enjoy doing watching

3514.8 --> 3526.9500000000003
that so but sometimes when there are

3524.13 --> 3529.83
some flat earthers in there it can be

3526.95 --> 3540.2
interesting I do agree especially when I

3529.83 --> 3540.2
want to join oh right Jose so the usual

3542.15 --> 3547.92
yeah that's the ballers that's what

3545.67 --> 3551.16
that's what they do with Nathan you know

3547.92 --> 3554.25
that right so why are you surprised to

3551.16 --> 3557.2999999999997
have that on your show they were bound

3554.25 --> 3557.3
to start doing that

3569.539 --> 3575.329
yeah I know what you mean [ __ ] use I

3572.91 --> 3583.5589999999997
can't stand that guy

3575.329 --> 3593.19
he's I don't know it just has a natural

3583.559 --> 3595.65
aggro to him like and he's an idiot

3593.19 --> 3597.799
he's like arrogant and an idiot like

3595.65 --> 3601.789
he's really [ __ ] dumb

3597.799 --> 3605.069
it's annoying like that high-intensity

3601.789 --> 3610.619
arrogance and being freaking dumb that

3605.069 --> 3614.989
is the worst it's just such the guy is a

3610.619 --> 3614.989
living dirge terrible

3636.97 --> 3639.72
all right

3642.78 --> 3645.869
[Music]

3647.73 --> 3653.89
no no I don't go there ruble that's not

3653.26 --> 3660.28
nice

3653.89 --> 3663.16
don't do that please you don't accuse

3660.28 --> 3668.98
people smoking crack that kind of [ __ ]

3663.16 --> 3672.43
it's like please sure they'll have their

3668.98 --> 3676.29
share of cannabis for sure cannabis

3672.43 --> 3679.06
doesn't pretty fold make you smart right

3676.29 --> 3680.74
you have to do that yourself and then it

3679.06 --> 3682.6
might enhance it if you're just a

3680.74 --> 3684.7
freaking idiot and you're gonna do that

3682.6 --> 3688.63
then it's just gonna amplify the idiot

3684.7 --> 3690.46
part so but I'm pretty sure they don't

3688.63 --> 3696.63
smoke crack so please don't accuse

3690.46 --> 3701.2
people of that Jesus really holy [ __ ]

3696.63 --> 3705.609
okay well since you're saying it it's

3701.2 --> 3706.6299999999997
probably a lie P Mars but I don't really

3705.609 --> 3711.49
care anyway

3706.63 --> 3715.6600000000003
I don't know what he did to become what

3711.49 --> 3722.41
he is now but I'm gonna basically judge

3715.66 --> 3725.7599999999998
him on what he is now really wow that's

3722.41 --> 3725.7599999999998
crazy okay

3726.83 --> 3729.98
[Music]

3733.89 --> 3737.58
[Music]

3744.74 --> 3754.7599999999998
no I don't ignore hard questions I do

3750.17 --> 3758.119
ignore typical regurgitated strawman

3754.76 --> 3761.48
questions though that's immediately

3758.119 --> 3765.4900000000002
forced to presuppose something because

3761.48 --> 3765.4900000000002
that's not a real open question

3772.469 --> 3780.969
well bring on your heart questions and

3775.779 --> 3782.799
actually make it a real question look I

3780.969 --> 3785.2490000000003
answered almost every questionnaire

3782.799 --> 3790.5389999999998
unless it's just more regurgitation

3785.249 --> 3792.999
strawman [ __ ] that have been already

3790.539 --> 3797.8790000000004
been answering like dozens of time in

3792.999 --> 3797.879
the last since the show started so

3810.04 --> 3813.15
behind the dome

3814.48 --> 3816.48
Oh

3816.64 --> 3822.7599999999998
but that's not a hard question did

3818.92 --> 3826.09
that's just vague what is your point why

3822.76 --> 3828.1600000000003
I see the sky behind the dome I take it

3826.09 --> 3831.67
that's like the church when I watch it

3828.16 --> 3839.08
from the gyro mast what is the freaking

3831.67 --> 3851.05
point you see it because that's now it's

3839.08 --> 3854.11
visible now

3851.05 --> 3856.09
now that's already a strawman these

3854.11 --> 3859.1200000000003
claims it's impossible on a flat earth

3856.09 --> 3861.46
based on what on what model on what

3859.12 --> 3864.37
exactly on the exclusion of perspective

3861.46 --> 3867.28
are not really properly interpreting

3864.37 --> 3869.77
visuals and how sight really works is it

3867.28 --> 3874.51
based that it's impossible on the

3869.77 --> 3877.21
presumption of that or not are not

3874.51 --> 3883.1800000000003
really judging visual things by optical

3877.21 --> 3884.7400000000002
standards because I'm pretty sure that

3883.18 --> 3888.91
everything you see is definitely

3884.74 --> 3891.04
possible on a flat earth you can't say

3888.91 --> 3893.8599999999997
the same thing for the globe earth

3891.04 --> 3896.52
though that's usually the problem though

3893.86 --> 3899.77
you can always presuppose that either

3896.52 --> 3902.29
curvature block side at some point and

3899.77 --> 3904.9
you just imagine that that's the edge of

3902.29 --> 3907.81
a curve or it doesn't and then it's all

3904.9 --> 3909.58
just you could just one moment to the

3907.81 --> 3912.04
earth now suddenly looming because it

3909.58 --> 3915.49
has to be so that is just uniformly

3912.04 --> 3919.09
being projected up just like it was a

3915.49 --> 3923.2
flat plane so that's the options really

3919.09 --> 3924.82
for the globe interpretation flat

3923.2 --> 3928.5699999999997
earthers do not have that problem we

3924.82 --> 3930.94
actually get into real optics and then

3928.57 --> 3933.4
stay persistent with that that's the

3930.94 --> 3935.53
difference you don't even do that you

3933.4 --> 3939.04
just keep on hanging on to these

3935.53 --> 3942.5800000000004
machinations that completely discard how

3939.04 --> 3945.37
optics works and just presupposes an

3942.58 --> 3948.49
orthographic view which per definition

3945.37 --> 3951.45
excludes real optics that can be proven

3948.49 --> 3951.45
it's demonstrated

3951.97 --> 3960.64
how doesn't match actual sight now in

3957.62 --> 3963.14
autographic view a line can be straight

3960.64 --> 3964.3399999999997
hit the point of something and then hit

3963.14 --> 3967.46
the point of something else in the

3964.34 --> 3969.7000000000003
distance and then in an actual view

3967.46 --> 3974.0
that's not going to be the case so it

3969.7 --> 3975.77
directly disproves that you can use auto

3974.0 --> 3978.94
graphic view for viewing function

3975.77 --> 3982.34
because it doesn't match provably so

3978.94 --> 3985.04
right so then what do you do you

3982.34 --> 3988.82
actually apply optics which you never do

3985.04 --> 3991.1
as a baller and then everything works on

3988.82 --> 3995.4100000000003
a flat earth because the earth just so

3991.1 --> 3995.41
happens to be flat what do you know

3999.29 --> 4002.449
[Music]

4004.97 --> 4012.14
we have to save flat earth because that

4007.579 --> 4023.48
is kind of the point it's flat the earth

4012.14 --> 4028.9
is flat it's not a ball not a ball of

4023.48 --> 4028.9
the size they'd like you to think it is

4031.869 --> 4042.23
that's a nonsensical statement bit

4036.74 --> 4043.819
better than new one its optics you're

4042.23 --> 4045.89
dealing with optics if you're gonna look

4043.819 --> 4048.8
at something in the distance it's going

4045.89 --> 4051.44
to be smaller it's you're gonna be

4048.8 --> 4053.3
looking over a surface there's gonna be

4051.44 --> 4055.01
a limited viewing angle because of that

4053.3 --> 4057.9100000000003
and then there's the diffraction limit

4055.01 --> 4060.4100000000003
which basically causes resolution issues

4057.91 --> 4063.5
causes things to disappear and all that

4060.41 --> 4067.609
combined and then there's of course the

4063.5 --> 4070.99
atmospheric deviations and all of that

4067.609 --> 4073.819
basically called causes things to

4070.99 --> 4076.609
towards the horizon them slightly fall

4073.819 --> 4082.7799999999997
into it causing the optical slant effect

4076.609 --> 4085.91
and that is how it works on earth and

4082.78 --> 4088.0400000000004
it's widely deducible that it's flat

4085.91 --> 4090.3689999999997
because of that because of the first

4088.04 --> 4095.18
distances that you can actually see and

4090.369 --> 4098.900000000001
the linear nature of the concealment

4095.18 --> 4100.43
rate used to be called obstruction rate

4098.9 --> 4102.29
but that's not what the effect really

4100.43 --> 4104.719
applies to obstruction rate can be then

4102.29 --> 4106.489
it's not an obstruction rate there's an

4104.719 --> 4108.5
obstruction sometimes at the coast the

4106.489 --> 4112.389999999999
tidal bulge that is an actual

4108.5 --> 4114.83
obstruction but further into the horizon

4112.39 --> 4116.509
there is consumed and it's not an

4114.83 --> 4117.23
obstruction it's not something in front

4116.509 --> 4123.339
of something else

4117.23 --> 4125.718999999999
it's basically folded into nothing

4123.339 --> 4128.98
that's what causes things from the

4125.719 --> 4128.9800000000005
bottom up to disappear

4130.45 --> 4143.239
that's optics yeah yeah optical slat

4140.72 --> 4145.7
it's so funny I've only been saying that

4143.239 --> 4148.58
for two years and it's been argued

4145.7 --> 4151.25
exactly clarified what that is it's not

4148.58 --> 4154.19
really new but maybe I guess to a

4151.25 --> 4157.759
magnesia Crete art troll keyboard

4154.19 --> 4160.04
warrior yeah it's new every time because

4157.759 --> 4163.279
you're a [ __ ] and you constantly

4160.04 --> 4166.46
forget everything cuz you're literally a

4163.279 --> 4170.06
[ __ ] and you waste all your time all

4166.46 --> 4172.25
day long in freakin chats with people

4170.06 --> 4177.339000000001
and videos you don't like because you're

4172.25 --> 4177.339
a [ __ ] mercury mercury m7

4194.69 --> 4200.659
hmm-hmm anyway I think I'm gonna round

4197.82 --> 4206.099999999999
out all the trolls are getting restless

4200.659 --> 4208.7699999999995
there we're ready to get shoved in the

4206.1 --> 4210.9890000000005
debates and start full-on puking as they

4208.77 --> 4213.780000000001
are allowed to do their and they don't

4210.989 --> 4219.089999999999
get timed out for being total wanker

4213.78 --> 4221.429
[ __ ] like you guys are like the

4219.09 --> 4223.7390000000005
social justice warriors of the internet

4221.429 --> 4226.29
like those crazy videos you get to see

4223.739 --> 4227.968999999999
sometimes on Alex Jones the social

4226.29 --> 4231.09
justice worries completely misbehaving

4227.969 --> 4233.79
in actual public that's you that's you

4231.09 --> 4236.46
but as a keyboard warrior on the

4233.79 --> 4239.909
internet that's what you are you're that

4236.46 --> 4243.21
terrible a lot of you are just so you

4239.909 --> 4244.799999999999
know just because we don't see you

4243.21 --> 4252.75
physically do that doesn't mean that

4244.8 --> 4256.02
you're not that just to remind you so

4252.75 --> 4259.56
I'm gonna round out the show thanks

4256.02 --> 4261.3
everyone for coming if you like the

4259.56 --> 4263.55
video then please upload it and I see

4261.3 --> 4265.4400000000005
there's been some trolls visiting so

4263.55 --> 4269.4890000000005
please try to counteract that a little

4265.44 --> 4272.759999999999
and show your appreciation and no I'm

4269.489 --> 4274.349999999999
not gonna invite you Brenda if you want

4272.76 --> 4278.04
that you're gonna do it a little bit

4274.35 --> 4279.570000000001
sooner and not like when the show is

4278.04 --> 4284.31
almost over that's not gonna happen

4279.57 --> 4287.699
never don't do that with Trump and it's

4284.31 --> 4290.85
Trump why would do that with Trump if he

4287.699 --> 4294.33
would call me but no sorry I meant

4290.85 --> 4297.02
rumpus I don't know yeah as an R in it I

4294.33 --> 4297.0199999999995
guess weird

4301.69 --> 4313.57
mm don't get cheeky with me I I get like

4310.449 --> 4316.049999999999
that to people's faces as well if it

4313.57 --> 4316.049999999999
comes to that

4316.8 --> 4321.3
goodbye Brenda there you go again

4322.86 --> 4327.66
so yeah I am gonna run out to show not

4325.51 --> 4331.81
gonna be distracted by the annoying

4327.66 --> 4333.43
trolls trumped us yep

4331.81 --> 4335.620000000001
that's kind of what happened in my mind

4333.43 --> 4340.3
paid off and they were Krampus

4335.62 --> 4349.12
it's just trump is kind of rum passing

4340.3 --> 4349.81
with this Twitter isn't he Krampus it's

4349.12 --> 4353.67
just weird

4349.81 --> 4358.63
I'm like imagining rumpus s Trump

4353.67 --> 4363.7300000000005
twittering like you're a traitor

4358.63 --> 4367.03
utter utter morons like obviously we are

4363.73 --> 4370.139999999999
the best in the world and I don't know

4367.03 --> 4372.13
it's a weird fantasy going on here

4370.14 --> 4374.59
thanks everyone for coming

4372.13 --> 4376.09
don't forget to upload the video and if

4374.59 --> 4378.13
you haven't already subscribed to my

4376.09 --> 4379.39
channel and hit the bell notification so

4378.13 --> 4381.1900000000005
you know when I'm going live which is

4379.39 --> 4385.530000000001
normally 2:00 p.m. and I'm so damn time

4381.19 --> 4387.879999999999
every day also please support the show

4385.53 --> 4389.53
technically I should ask this at the

4387.88 --> 4391.33
beginning of the show because then

4389.53 --> 4393.79
people might actually be more inclined

4391.33 --> 4397.18
to do it and most of them tend to on

4393.79 --> 4400.239
average slip away half way the show but

4397.18 --> 4402.52
please do do sometimes support my

4400.239 --> 4405.419999999999
channel through the super chat or even

4402.52 --> 4410.410000000001
better through PayPal and I got a

4405.42 --> 4412.84
patreon and I have a GoFundMe and yeah

4410.41 --> 4414.79
if you want me to get that p1000 that's

4412.84 --> 4417.31
the way to do it so you can definitely

4414.79 --> 4422.11
help me get there and progress the show

4417.31 --> 4426.280000000001
content and yeah I will be back tomorrow

4422.11 --> 4427.719
with flattered early-bird number 191 I'm

4426.28 --> 4429.55
also gonna join the Flat Earth debates

4427.719 --> 4434.08
right after this there's still room on

4429.55 --> 4434.9800000000005
the panel so until the next video keep

4434.08 --> 4439.23
it

4434.98 --> 4439.23
flat and hashtag mija of course

4439.46 --> 4474.56
