whether today is

124.24 --> 126.64
kind of

126.96 --> 134.4
yeah it's not really a big gray soup

130.479 --> 137.59900000000002
although almost but it's cloud covered

134.4 --> 137.59900000000002
and there doesn't seem to be

138.16 --> 142.599
any real wind going on there

144.8 --> 151.92000000000002
and yeah outside it's not even that cold

148.239 --> 151.92000000000002
or maybe it's just less moist

152.0 --> 157.72
right but overall not a very interesting

154.48 --> 157.72
one day

158.64 --> 160.95899999999997
right

168.4 --> 172.08
hello bill knight the science denier

170.64 --> 173.51899999999998

lee

186.08 --> 188.56
vesey

188.72 --> 192.72
right yeah good to see you all it is

191.36 --> 197.4
monday

192.72 --> 197.4
the 13th of december 2021

200.64 --> 204.72
and yeah my voice seems to be a little

202.56 --> 206.959
low

204.72 --> 209.84
and

206.959 --> 209.84
i'm a little

210.0 --> 215.12
yeah

212.959 --> 217.04
a little tired i guess because i had

215.12 --> 219.04
like a late night

217.04 --> 221.519
way too late

219.04 --> 224.159
i kind of was watching a movie

221.519 --> 226.48000000000002
it turned out to be very long

224.159 --> 229.519
and then i just couldn't stop watching

226.48 --> 230.879
and then it became way too late

229.519 --> 233.59900000000002
so yeah

230.879 --> 233.599
kind of like a

234.0 --> 237.2
sleep

235.2 --> 239.11999999999998
mistake

237.2 --> 241.92
but i'll be fine just

239.12 --> 244.159
not top of my form but at least i'm not

241.92 --> 247.28
like sick or anything it's just that

244.159 --> 247.28
watching this movie

248.4 --> 253.68
called wyatt earp

250.959 --> 257.759
or as i kept on hearing in my head

253.68 --> 260.23900000000003
through the mandela effect wyatt derp

257.759 --> 262.56
couldn't help it

260.239 --> 264.63899999999995
but yeah it was

262.56 --> 268.32
it was a very interesting movie it

264.639 --> 270.639
lasted like three hours though

268.32 --> 270.639
so

271.44 --> 277.6
and that kind of kept me up in the night

273.759 --> 277.6
i should have just not watched it

277.68 --> 283.199
and just saved it for middle of the day

279.759 --> 286.72
but yeah i was stubborn and so then this

283.199 --> 286.72
happens but i'll be all right

294.08 --> 297.84
hello nathan oakley 1980

312.72 --> 315.68
right so

313.84 --> 318.08
i don't think i'm gonna be yeah unless

315.68 --> 319.52
i'm like really gonna

318.08 --> 321.59999999999997
wake up

319.52 --> 325.0
i'm probably gonna keep this show a

321.6 --> 325.0
little short

326.24 --> 330.16
because i think that probably just going

328.08 --> 332.15999999999997
out for groceries like before the flat

330.16 --> 335.16
earth debates will wake me up a little

332.16 --> 335.16
more

355.44 --> 359.52
russia's

356.56 --> 362.639
russians just launched another rocket

359.52 --> 364.4
or did you even hear that was it

362.639 --> 365.759
two days ago or yesterday i don't

364.4 --> 367.67999999999995
remember somewhere this weekend they

365.759 --> 370.8
were also

367.68 --> 373.12
launching another blue origin thing

370.8 --> 373.12
again

374.479 --> 381.36
but yeah no particularly interesting

377.759 --> 382.56
people right taking the right so

381.36 --> 384.47900000000004
i guess

382.56 --> 387.479
it kind of slipped by most people's

384.479 --> 387.479
attention

398.28 --> 401.39
[Music]

404.84 --> 407.94
[Music]

408.24 --> 410.479
wow

411.36 --> 415.039
all right almost lost my mic there

415.599 --> 422.0
hey neil cosentino

418.56 --> 424.96
i am anglo sexton supremacy

422.0 --> 427.84
i don't know if i am but

424.96 --> 430.4
i certainly like to say it in chats for

427.84 --> 430.4
the fun of it

430.56 --> 434.199
hey tony whitcomb

437.199 --> 442.28000000000003
oh hmm

439.28 --> 442.28
okay

457.759 --> 460.16
right

463.199 --> 467.759
i get quality ads i don't know nathan

468.16 --> 471.44
it

468.879 --> 473.28000000000003
it really depends per person right it's

471.44 --> 475.12
google ad so the ads are going to be

473.28 --> 477.52
attuned to

475.12 --> 480.08
the person tuning in

477.52 --> 482.639
it's different for everybody

480.08 --> 485.639
right i get dutch ads

482.639 --> 485.639
so

502.08 --> 505.68
right

503.44 --> 509.639
okay

505.68 --> 509.639
be right back in two minutes

527.68 --> 530.68
uh

638.72 --> 640.9590000000001
you

642.48 --> 647.64
hello george sanford that flat fellow

669.76 --> 676.8
i get the good okay nathan if you say so

672.72 --> 676.8000000000001
i get the good at weird though

683.12 --> 686.24
but

683.92 --> 689.4399999999999
yeah you're saying i get the great ads

686.24 --> 692.24
well maybe from your side

689.44 --> 694.9590000000001
but sometimes i get like really shitty

692.24 --> 694.9590000000001
ads too

695.2 --> 700.1600000000001
like this weird super leftist type of

697.76 --> 700.16
crap

700.399 --> 703.399
so

705.36 --> 711.92
but i in the yeah i get the same ads

708.16 --> 715.1999999999999
pretty much everywhere i get

711.92 --> 717.8389999999999
typicals similar ads over at your

715.2 --> 717.839
channel

725.839 --> 729.519
and apparently some people don't get ads

727.92 --> 731.8389999999999
at all

729.519 --> 731.839
right

758.35 --> 761.389
[Music]

779.519 --> 785.44
right what might also be

782.639 --> 789.2
a difference is that i always turn off

785.44 --> 789.2
the ads that are not

789.44 --> 793.0400000000001
like that last longer than five seconds

791.44 --> 795.12
you can't click away

793.04 --> 795.92
you can actually choose to turn those

795.12 --> 798.16
off

795.92 --> 802.079
because a lot of those ads are really

798.16 --> 805.12
annoying like alcohol ads like they're

802.079 --> 807.1999999999999
all these freaking super long ads

805.12 --> 808.8
are the most annoying you can't click

807.2 --> 810.88
them away

808.8 --> 812.8389999999999
those don't appear on my channel because

810.88 --> 815.8389999999999
i specifically

812.839 --> 817.36
in in the flags

815.839 --> 820.0
of ads

817.36 --> 822.0790000000001
turn those off

820.0 --> 824.32
so that might also be helping you could

822.079 --> 828.519
do that too nathan

824.32 --> 828.519
pretty sure you don't do that

831.519 --> 837.079
and you have to manually do it every

833.68 --> 837.079
single time

861.199 --> 864.16
hey michael khan

864.32 --> 868.88
this crazy app by the way also good to

866.56 --> 870.959
see you

868.88 --> 872.72
right i'm not in optimal condition right

870.959 --> 874.7199999999999
now because i have basically got a bit

872.72 --> 876.72
of sleep shortage

874.72 --> 877.839
i'm not less stressed out but i'm like

876.72 --> 879.12
little

877.839 --> 881.36
wobbly

879.12 --> 884.88
so i'm gonna be going to the toilet a

881.36 --> 887.88
little bit more often than usual

884.88 --> 887.88
uh

908.88 --> 912.8389999999999
hey slow mo moon buggy

927.839 --> 934.399
i get pummeled with alcohol ads do i

931.92 --> 938.16
well i was just making a point that i've

934.399 --> 938.16
noticed out there in ads

938.48 --> 943.9200000000001
like the long ones that take like 20 25

942.079 --> 945.92
seconds you can't click away a lot of

943.92 --> 948.3199999999999
those are alcohol

945.92 --> 948.3199999999999
adds

949.279 --> 954.8
so i know you won't be able to get those

951.839 --> 957.1990000000001
maybe shorter ones

954.8 --> 959.4399999999999
but my ads technically don't last more

957.199 --> 963.399
than five seconds they're all

959.44 --> 963.399
you can all click them away

970.639 --> 973.04
all right

978.0 --> 981.36
god what is this

981.44 --> 984.9200000000001
be right back

1086.72 --> 1089.72
um

1126.48 --> 1129.48
hmm

1169.52 --> 1173.12
well neil it's

1171.36 --> 1175.6789999999999
don't worry about it

1173.12 --> 1178.799
look it's because i

1175.679 --> 1180.16
i basically interrupted my sleep cycle

1178.799 --> 1183.12
so

1180.16 --> 1183.1200000000001
when that happens

1183.36 --> 1187.9189999999999
like yeah it just gets all a little

1185.919 --> 1191.039
weird

1187.919 --> 1191.039
it's temporary

1191.36 --> 1195.84
so it's i'm not like sick or anything

1194.24 --> 1198.72
it's just that like yeah that's what

1195.84 --> 1202.3999999999999
happens when you go to bed way too late

1198.72 --> 1202.4
or at least that's what happens with me

1202.72 --> 1207.2
and that's like nothing special like

1204.799 --> 1209.84
even 20 years ago when i would have this

1207.2 --> 1209.8400000000001
type of thing

1210.24 --> 1215.2
i too would just be next day be really

1213.44 --> 1216.4
wonky and all that

1215.2 --> 1218.4
and then

1216.4 --> 1219.44
go to bed normally again and it's gone

1218.4 --> 1222.3200000000002
so

1219.44 --> 1222.3200000000002
it's just normal

1222.72 --> 1227.3600000000001
and i feel a bit stupid for having gone

1225.2 --> 1231.039
to bed so late i should have just not

1227.36 --> 1231.039
watched that movie and waited

1231.36 --> 1236.7199999999998
until today

1233.2 --> 1236.72
in the like in the evening

1237.36 --> 1243.4799999999998
but it was a really good movie though

1240.32 --> 1243.48
i thought

1253.36 --> 1256.36
so

1271.2 --> 1276.8400000000001
glow busters has been put on eyes well

1273.84 --> 1276.84
apparently

1282.08 --> 1284.96
oh where was it

1286.96 --> 1291.679
yeah

1288.64 --> 1292.7990000000002
so they left a bob left in a community

1291.679 --> 1296.4
post

1292.799 --> 1296.4
super whiny by the way

1297.44 --> 1301.96
basically a letter full of complaints

1325.12 --> 1328.12
so

1335.44 --> 1337.76
hmm

1338.64 --> 1342.64
all right

1340.48 --> 1346.039
yeah maybe i'll check that out load

1342.64 --> 1346.039
lloyd cole

1351.28 --> 1354.28
so

1365.12 --> 1367.4399999999998
yeah

1367.84 --> 1372.72
yeah neil it is that's why i'm not

1370.64 --> 1374.88
really gonna deal with that right now

1372.72 --> 1377.76
i'm just gonna take it easy not gonna be

1374.88 --> 1380.159
all outraged

1377.76 --> 1382.4
or whatever i'm not just gonna tap into

1380.159 --> 1382.4
that

1383.6 --> 1387.3999999999999
not right now anyway

1415.76 --> 1418.76
um

1439.52 --> 1444.679
con

1440.48 --> 1444.679
all right be right back

1464.72 --> 1467.72
um

1492.48 --> 1495.48
so

1507.76 --> 1510.76
so

1569.12 --> 1571.84
um

1617.6 --> 1619.9189999999999
hmm

1621.919 --> 1627.64
all right look sounds interesting i'll

1624.24 --> 1627.64
check it out

1651.039 --> 1657.52
man these ad bots

1654.72 --> 1659.6000000000001
i was totally right about it by the way

1657.52 --> 1661.279
because i've been just like digging

1659.6 --> 1662.559
around in some other

1661.279 --> 1664.96
streams

1662.559 --> 1666.48
and these freaking things pop up

1664.96 --> 1670.24
everywhere

1666.48 --> 1670.24
like every jet

1670.799 --> 1674.12
it's crazy

1684.24 --> 1689.76
right so guys yeah i'm not

1687.76 --> 1691.6
i'm not gonna like really

1689.76 --> 1695.1589999999999
do a great show i think i'm gonna round

1691.6 --> 1695.1589999999999
out really early

1698.64 --> 1704.159
i need to cool off and

1702.159 --> 1708.24
make sure that i don't go

1704.159 --> 1708.24
to bed so insanely late again

1709.76 --> 1715.64
but yeah i'm pretty sure tomorrow is

1711.52 --> 1715.6399999999999
going to be a much better show

1728.72 --> 1734.24
right so yeah very very short little

1731.6 --> 1736.0
show basically yeah it's too bad chad's

1734.24 --> 1739.84
really active i just can't really do

1736.0 --> 1739.84
anything right with it right now

1740.32 --> 1746.48
better be ready for fed today yeah

1743.84 --> 1746.48
i'll try

1747.039 --> 1752.08
it might be that i'm just gonna like do

1748.96 --> 1754.0
groceries get back and then maybe

1752.08 --> 1755.36
just go to bed again

1754.0 --> 1757.6
because i'm i

1755.36 --> 1759.52
this is yeah i'm not really all that

1757.6 --> 1763.799
functional at the moment and it's

1759.52 --> 1763.799
embarrassing i'm sorry guys

1769.6 --> 1775.52
fresh air yeah that will probably help

1773.36 --> 1779.84
also getting moving will probably help

1775.52 --> 1781.84
