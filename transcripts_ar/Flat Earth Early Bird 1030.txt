4.89 --> 36.159
[Music]

41.52 --> 46.160000000000004
good

42.96 --> 49.36
morning welcome to one that flat earth

46.16 --> 51.44
early bird number 1030 i'm your host

49.36 --> 53.519999999999996
irwin and before we start the show

51.44 --> 56.079
please don't forget to share it on any

53.52 --> 58.0
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

56.079 --> 60.160000000000004
already subscribe to my channel and hit

58.0 --> 62.719
the bell notification so you know when

60.16 --> 64.79899999999999
i'm going live which is normally 1pm

62.719 --> 67.2
amsterdam time in the weekdays and 2 pm

64.799 --> 69.68
amsterdam time in the weekend and please

67.2 --> 71.76
also do support me through the paypal

69.68 --> 73.68
patreon crypto wallet super chat and a

71.76 --> 76.72
membership system join button

73.68 --> 78.96000000000001
that will be much appreciated

76.72 --> 78.96
so

79.84 --> 85.64
whether today is

82.64 --> 85.64
clouded

87.759 --> 91.04
little

88.799 --> 92.88000000000001
bits and pieces of blue in between here

91.04 --> 94.0
and there somewhere but it's overall

92.88 --> 97.03999999999999
still

94.0 --> 97.04
kind of rainy and

97.28 --> 101.68
oh look there's a bit of sun over there

99.28 --> 103.92
huh

101.68 --> 103.92
all right

109.28 --> 113.36
i don't really know what to make of this

110.88 --> 116.64
weather we'll see it does change around

113.36 --> 120.32
a lot during the day so

116.64 --> 120.32000000000001
as it has been last week

121.439 --> 126.88
so

122.32 --> 126.88
hello stone monkey 3d first in chat

127.119 --> 133.479
it is saturday

128.64 --> 133.47899999999998
the 2nd of october 2021

140.8 --> 147.36
and i'll be doing

143.36 --> 149.84
one and a half hour show probably

147.36 --> 152.31900000000002
kind of depends on what's gonna happen

149.84 --> 152.31900000000002
in chat

152.959 --> 155.959
huh

164.72 --> 168.08
what's been going down

168.879 --> 173.84
i think i missed quite a few things

171.2 --> 173.83999999999997
yesterday

174.08 --> 179.04000000000002
again

174.959 --> 180.159
miss i keep missing jim bob so annoying

179.04 --> 182.64
i don't know

180.159 --> 185.12
i keep on missing it just being busy

182.64 --> 186.64
with something else right at that time

185.12 --> 188.56
oh well

186.64 --> 191.599
and yeah the same goes for mitchell who

188.56 --> 192.68
by the way has this uncanny ability to

191.599 --> 196.319
go live

192.68 --> 196.31900000000002
simultaneously with jim bob

196.84 --> 200.48
anyway uh

202.0 --> 204.48
let's see

206.08 --> 210.239
all right yeah little

208.239 --> 214.879
mini arwyn event

210.239 --> 214.879
i went on jose jg's yeah yesterday

218.239 --> 223.20000000000002
up against sean hawkins i haven't

220.319 --> 225.76
actually watched it back

223.2 --> 228.159
like it was pretty impromptu i didn't

225.76 --> 229.92
expect actually to be going up against

228.159 --> 233.04
sean hawkins i just wanted to kind of

229.92 --> 236.39999999999998
say hello and jose invited me on

233.04 --> 239.84
said i could say anything

236.4 --> 241.92000000000002
so i basically roasted him

239.84 --> 244.56
in those 30 seconds

241.92 --> 247.04
and then kind of like he just put me on

244.56 --> 249.12
the railroad what he was planning to do

247.04 --> 251.35999999999999
typical jose it's just oh you're here

249.12 --> 252.959
okay now we're going to do this

251.36 --> 255.36
it kind of does that

252.959 --> 257.68
this kindergarten system and hey it

255.36 --> 259.519
works for him and considering the people

257.68 --> 260.79900000000004
he typically has hanging around in his

259.519 --> 263.68
chat

260.799 --> 266.08
that kind of works

263.68 --> 268.72
but yeah he put he made me face sean

266.08 --> 271.19899999999996
hawkins

268.72 --> 274.88000000000005
which is kind of a waste of time

271.199 --> 274.88
because we all know sean hawkins

275.199 --> 279.44
he just does the same [ __ ] over and over

277.6 --> 282.44
again and he ignores everything that is

279.44 --> 282.44
said

282.72 --> 289.12
but yeah if the polaris challenge and i

286.32 --> 292.4
just like oh math this math that and i'm

289.12 --> 294.32
like yeah [ __ ] you sean hawkins

292.4 --> 296.15999999999997
you know i don't give a [ __ ] about all

294.32 --> 297.919
that nonsense

296.16 --> 299.84000000000003
why don't you first prove that the earth

297.919 --> 302.479
is actually a sphere

299.84 --> 303.84
and polaris angles and all that actually

302.479 --> 305.59999999999997
match up

303.84 --> 306.88
right if the earth was a sphere then

305.6 --> 308.40000000000003
you'd be able to

306.88 --> 310.4
have

308.4 --> 314.56
live footage

310.4 --> 317.84
somehow from someone anywhere

314.56 --> 320.96
at any point having gone to the north

317.84 --> 323.35999999999996
pole and then having filmed polaris a

320.96 --> 325.039
dead center above them

323.36 --> 327.84000000000003
well there's no such footage and i've

325.039 --> 329.919
actually taken notice of

327.84 --> 331.84
what are technically rumors and they

329.919 --> 333.56
were all laughing up over there oh it's

331.84 --> 335.67999999999995
so funny it's

333.56 --> 337.759
unsubstantiated rumors oh yeah are they

335.68 --> 341.52
unsubstantiated

337.759 --> 343.36
or were they actually in the field

341.52 --> 345.28
data of people that

343.36 --> 348.47900000000004
kind of halfway attempted to pay

345.28 --> 350.96
attention to what happens over there

348.479 --> 352.639
and those rumors are that the further

350.96 --> 354.71999999999997
you go north

352.639 --> 358.319
the slower

354.72 --> 362.72
the globe of the heavens rotates

358.319 --> 362.72
so that for some reason if you would

363.039 --> 368.639
like continue that pattern

366.96 --> 371.68
one would conclude that you can't

368.639 --> 374.479
actually reach polaris dead center above

371.68 --> 376.319
you because it slows down and then you

374.479 --> 377.84
never really would get to reach it

376.319 --> 380.96000000000004
because it would

377.84 --> 383.19899999999996
go dead halt maybe even certainly go the

380.96 --> 386.479
other direction which would be

383.199 --> 386.479
absolutely bizarre

388.319 --> 395.639
even just intuitively

390.8 --> 395.639
so i yeah put that down and

396.24 --> 402.96000000000004
yeah then eventually just left and they

399.36 --> 405.199
kept talking about me and about it

402.96 --> 407.19899999999996
what i said for like the rest of the

405.199 --> 409.599
shows

407.199 --> 411.68
even rumpus came in and started to do

409.599 --> 413.84
his thing and then eventually it was

411.68 --> 416.56
just a conversation about food for like

413.84 --> 416.56
half an hour

417.759 --> 421.599
as i kept on

419.599 --> 423.68
actually talking about flat earth and

421.599 --> 426.56
about what i said in the chat that was

423.68 --> 428.56
very typical so

426.56 --> 432.44
i don't know if anybody has actually

428.56 --> 432.44
taken notice of that

436.96 --> 442.15999999999997
tasmanian truther aries curse of man

439.44 --> 445.44
merica silver patriot

442.16 --> 449.36
michael o'rourke it's been a while

445.44 --> 449.36
chateau artery

449.44 --> 453.44
15 degrees per hour everywhere

452.4 --> 456.79999999999995
oh you

453.44 --> 459.039
15 degree degrees per hour oh so you

456.8 --> 459.039
mean

459.759 --> 463.639
rotation of the heavens

464.4 --> 468.15999999999997
sure

465.759 --> 470.47900000000004
the celestials rotate 15 degrees per

468.16 --> 470.47900000000004
hour

471.12 --> 474.52
so it seems

478.479 --> 484.24
does that mean it doesn't take 24 hours

481.039 --> 484.24
to go around

485.199 --> 488.08
does that mean

487.039 --> 492.24
i

488.08 --> 494.96
i don't understand the question but

492.24 --> 497.68
yeah anyway it happened i don't know if

494.96 --> 501.039
anybody has taken notice i know

497.68 --> 503.36
jose jg isn't exactly

501.039 --> 506.36
any of your favorite channels it isn't

503.36 --> 506.36
mine

508.8 --> 514.159
all right i'll just link you up

512.399 --> 517.479
let's see if i can find the moment where

514.159 --> 517.479
i get in

530.24 --> 533.24
right

537.279 --> 540.8
yeah it's a

538.88 --> 544.4399999999999
little before the

540.8 --> 544.4399999999999
half hour mark

552.72 --> 559.2
yeah i'll just link you up at this time

554.72 --> 559.2
slot i haven't jumped in there yet

559.519 --> 565.12
but i'm in the

560.839 --> 565.12
chat so i know i will be

565.279 --> 570.32
right

567.6 --> 570.32
there you go

570.8 --> 573.4399999999999
check it out

574.48 --> 578.88
and you sort of feedback would be kind

576.24 --> 581.6800000000001
of welcome i i don't really like to go

578.88 --> 581.68
up against

582.959 --> 586.88
anti-flat earth just like that anymore

588.24 --> 592.0
and in this case i didn't really plan to

590.0 --> 594.8
i just wanted to kind of say hello

592.0 --> 596.64
that's it but then yeah i was put in the

594.8 --> 599.5999999999999
game and i was like okay well i'm gonna

596.64 --> 602.56
play that game anyway why not

599.6 --> 605.36
i mean it's only sean hawkins it's dumb

602.56 --> 609.1199999999999
as a brick so shouldn't be too much of a

605.36 --> 609.12
problem maybe math nuisance

609.279 --> 611.6
uh

615.36 --> 619.04
things rotates no i'm not talking about

618.24 --> 621.839
the

619.04 --> 622.8
apparent spin

621.839 --> 626.72
of the

622.8 --> 626.7199999999999
celestial demisphere

626.959 --> 631.5189999999999
oh they were like hung up or over that

629.04 --> 633.519
word too ooh demi sphere damager what is

631.519 --> 635.68
that that's not english

633.519 --> 637.76
i guess that might be right although i

635.68 --> 640.2399999999999
think that demai

637.76 --> 640.24
is like

640.959 --> 646.2399999999999
i think that's like a latin

643.519 --> 647.519
phraseology

646.24 --> 649.6800000000001
it is like a

647.519 --> 651.12
but it is not a hemisphere right they

649.68 --> 653.68
thought oh we're usually talking about

651.12 --> 655.2
hemisphere no no the hemisphere is

653.68 --> 658.2399999999999
very specific

655.2 --> 660.24
globe geometry orientated that's why i

658.24 --> 662.48
don't use that because it has nothing to

660.24 --> 665.6800000000001
do with globe geometry

662.48 --> 668.0790000000001
it's only how to describe half a sphere

665.68 --> 670.3199999999999
an apparent sphere that we see the

668.079 --> 672.959
celestial demisphere and that's why i

670.32 --> 676.399
just like to call it themisphere

672.959 --> 678.959
i could just say oh it's a sphere but i

676.399 --> 681.68
it's not actually a sphere

678.959 --> 683.5189999999999
it's only apparent and you only ever see

681.68 --> 686.3199999999999
half of it nobody's ever seen more than

683.519 --> 689.279
half of the heavenly stars there's no

686.32 --> 690.72
proof you they exist

689.279 --> 694.8
beyond

690.72 --> 697.44
below the horizon right

694.8 --> 700.88
but yeah when i was saying rotate around

697.44 --> 704.0790000000001
slower isn't not the spin of the

700.88 --> 708.48
apparent demisphere no it's

704.079 --> 711.04
the angular change of the apparent axis

708.48 --> 713.519
of the demisphere

711.04 --> 717.8389999999999
so polaris

713.519 --> 719.92
how it supposedly rotates towards your

717.839 --> 723.7600000000001
zenith

719.92 --> 724.8
that rotation goes slower over the same

723.76 --> 729.8
distance

724.8 --> 729.8
that was the rotation i was referring to

730.0 --> 734.0
maybe that didn't come across nobody

731.839 --> 737.7600000000001
really inquired

734.0 --> 741.399
at the time that's what i meant though

737.76 --> 741.399
stone monkey 3d

755.839 --> 761.0400000000001
beyond the eyes in our

758.399 --> 763.44
my opinion

761.04 --> 765.36
why how would my opinion be relevant to

763.44 --> 767.44
any of that

765.36 --> 769.839
i don't know

767.44 --> 773.839
never been there

769.839 --> 773.839
is the area finite

774.32 --> 777.0400000000001
well

775.519 --> 778.32
in some ways

777.04 --> 781.04
i mean

778.32 --> 783.7600000000001
if it might just be looping at some

781.04 --> 787.1999999999999
point back to

783.76 --> 789.4399999999999
the north or wherever that is exactly

787.2 --> 789.44
right

789.519 --> 796.0
but the entirety of the volume

794.0 --> 799.2
must be limited

796.0 --> 801.839
that's that's my opinion i could guess

799.2 --> 804.24
right cannot be infinite amount of

801.839 --> 804.24
matter

805.6 --> 811.6800000000001
so whether you run into like a weird

808.48 --> 811.6800000000001
barrier or something

811.76 --> 815.519
or

812.88 --> 819.199
you suddenly end up unexpectedly in

815.519 --> 822.0
another region familiar

819.199 --> 824.8
recognizable as being in what we know as

822.0 --> 826.8
the north of the realm

824.8 --> 830.959
well that would also then

826.8 --> 833.4399999999999
pose a limitation to the volume

830.959 --> 833.4399999999999
a loop

839.36 --> 844.639
but yeah it might take a whole lot of

842.72 --> 848.72
traveling before you get to that point

844.639 --> 848.72
because who knows how much room

848.8 --> 852.079
is

850.639 --> 854.399
beyond the

852.079 --> 856.8
the ice wall let's just call it the ice

854.399 --> 859.6
wall don't know if there is an actual

856.8 --> 861.89
ice wall everywhere there but

859.6 --> 865.019
right

861.89 --> 865.019
[Music]

881.68 --> 885.8389999999999
what do you respond to

889.279 --> 892.48
planes drones conserving angular

891.04 --> 894.0
momentum

892.48 --> 897.24
it's nonsense

894.0 --> 897.24
they can't

901.76 --> 905.6
they would have to be actively

907.12 --> 915.279
thrown in orbit so it doesn't happen so

910.88 --> 917.8389999999999
angular momentum with planes and drones

915.279 --> 919.8389999999999
well it's just gonna glide as it does

917.839 --> 922.24
but it all depends on the medium they

919.839 --> 922.24
are in

922.959 --> 927.079
and if that medium moves

928.079 --> 932.88
then

929.44 --> 932.8800000000001
it will move as well

932.959 --> 935.8389999999999
and if the

934.72 --> 936.72
ground

935.839 --> 939.36
earth

936.72 --> 941.36
would supposedly spin underneath it

939.36 --> 944.639
then the

941.36 --> 946.9590000000001
plane or drone in that non-spinning

944.639 --> 948.9590000000001
medium

946.959 --> 950.0
to it yeah it would technically stay in

948.959 --> 951.1199999999999
its

950.0 --> 952.8
in its

951.12 --> 955.04
pathway

952.8 --> 957.92
as it goes but the earth would also be

955.04 --> 960.639
spinning underneath it making it deviate

957.92 --> 964.36
in accordance to coriolis

960.639 --> 964.36
but that doesn't happen

985.839 --> 991.6800000000001
yes demi traveler

989.12 --> 994.399
i see that as a legitimate possibility

991.68 --> 995.7589999999999
yes multiple realms old chain of realms

994.399 --> 996.639
who knows

995.759 --> 999.44
like

996.639 --> 1002.399
on the basic premise i'd say maybe the

999.44 --> 1003.9200000000001
total realms are three one north

1002.399 --> 1005.92
one south

1003.92 --> 1007.199
and the middle the middle earth our

1005.92 --> 1008.0
realm

1007.199 --> 1011.4399999999999
or

1008.0 --> 1014.0
there might be a total of 33 realms

1011.44 --> 1016.399
which would be extra

1014.0 --> 1018.16
spooky there might be a whole bunch of

1016.399 --> 1020.72
realms

1018.16 --> 1022.959
another a number that i don't

1020.72 --> 1025.679
think it could ever turn out to be is

1022.959 --> 1029.52
infinite it's not actually a number

1025.679 --> 1032.0
there cannot be infinite realm segments

1029.52 --> 1034.72
but there could be a lot

1032.0 --> 1034.72
you don't know

1035.36 --> 1045.4389999999999
i think 33 is a freaking huge amount

1040.64 --> 1046.959
or get extra extra extra spooky 666

1045.439 --> 1050.0
realms

1046.959 --> 1050.0
i highly doubt it

1050.4 --> 1057.52
i don't know man dude with the

1053.039 --> 1057.52
simulatory nature of this realm set up

1057.6 --> 1061.84
maybe the amount of realms available to

1059.919 --> 1063.76
us are

1061.84 --> 1064.8799999999999
dynamic

1063.76 --> 1066.0
maybe

1064.88 --> 1068.64
there are periods where there's

1066.0 --> 1070.32
literally only one because of

1068.64 --> 1072.4
circumstances

1070.32 --> 1075.2
that are beyond our

1072.4 --> 1077.76
current grasp i mean you could science

1075.2 --> 1079.76
fiction think your way around it and

1077.76 --> 1082.0
have some conditions maybe moral

1079.76 --> 1084.32
vibration conditions or whatever amount

1082.0 --> 1086.799
of energy available

1084.32 --> 1090.1599999999999
and that under other conditions suddenly

1086.799 --> 1092.799
realm segments open up

1090.16 --> 1095.2
because you hit that frequency something

1092.799 --> 1096.72
like that right

1095.2 --> 1098.96
or it's something that

1096.72 --> 1100.96
people have to actively do to kind of

1098.96 --> 1102.72
like open the gates

1100.96 --> 1107.24
and then other realm segments become

1102.72 --> 1107.24
available so yeah dude

1112.0 --> 1114.559
who knows

1116.32 --> 1120.72
but what i don't see

1118.24 --> 1122.72
god having designed the place as is

1120.72 --> 1125.6000000000001
infinite amount

1122.72 --> 1125.6000000000001
i mean maybe

1126.0 --> 1130.4
entire realm segments and their content

1128.64 --> 1133.039
could simply be

1130.4 --> 1133.039
erased

1133.28 --> 1137.36
like they could suddenly disappear and

1136.0 --> 1140.96
then maybe

1137.36 --> 1143.28
another realm segment comes in its place

1140.96 --> 1144.48
when the gate is reopened

1143.28 --> 1146.8799999999999
right that

1144.48 --> 1149.76
there might be a form of infinite

1146.88 --> 1149.7600000000002
variation

1149.84 --> 1155.039
according to god's design that could be

1152.48 --> 1157.1200000000001
a possibility but not

1155.039 --> 1159.52
infinite volume

1157.12 --> 1161.039
not infinite amounts at the same time

1159.52 --> 1163.36
existing

1161.039 --> 1168.0
that part

1163.36 --> 1168.0
i have to exclude that as a possibility

1168.72 --> 1172.76
on philosophical grounds

1183.12 --> 1186.3999999999999
hey seeking star wars

1191.2 --> 1197.24
and we can where did you hear that

1193.28 --> 1197.24
that's very silly

1210.96 --> 1214.88
i mean

1212.24 --> 1219.039
kfc's at the ice wall

1214.88 --> 1222.0800000000002
i think that would be more like kfps

1219.039 --> 1223.919
as in penguins not chickens

1222.08 --> 1227.6399999999999
don't think chickens would do very well

1223.919 --> 1227.64
in the arctic region

1245.2 --> 1248.96
oh okay

1246.72 --> 1251.28
it was a joke

1248.96 --> 1253.3600000000001
of course it is a joke

1251.28 --> 1255.039
here i go again

1253.36 --> 1259.6789999999999
white noising

1255.039 --> 1261.84
that it is meant as a joke just it to

1259.679 --> 1263.2
get an opportunity to get into the

1261.84 --> 1264.3999999999999
mechanics

1263.2 --> 1267.2
this

1264.4 --> 1267.919
is kind of like a bit of an autistic of

1267.2 --> 1270.0800000000002
me

1267.919 --> 1272.66
really when i do that

1270.08 --> 1276.249
i just like doing that

1272.66 --> 1276.249
[Music]

1276.48 --> 1280.72
no refrigeration needed yeah for sure

1284.159 --> 1291.8400000000001
you guess it's silly to ponder why

1288.08 --> 1291.84
why is it silly to ponder

1293.36 --> 1297.039
i mean

1294.4 --> 1297.8400000000001
is it silly to ponder for a very little

1297.039 --> 1300.0
kid

1297.84 --> 1301.6789999999999
how their future would be

1300.0 --> 1303.6
in a way yes because they have very

1301.679 --> 1304.72
little grip over what it will become

1303.6 --> 1306.24
what

1304.72 --> 1308.32
it's like to

1306.24 --> 1309.36
change

1308.32 --> 1311.36
they don't know what they're going to

1309.36 --> 1313.36
change towards from their conscious

1311.36 --> 1316.08
vantage point necessarily unless they

1313.36 --> 1316.08
have some very

1316.84 --> 1321.28
serious vision [ __ ]

1319.2 --> 1323.1200000000001
maybe and then they don't necessarily

1321.28 --> 1324.6399999999999
know how to deal with that

1323.12 --> 1326.08
so they'll still end up in the same

1324.64 --> 1329.039
position because the consciousness

1326.08 --> 1329.039
cannot be forced

1330.96 --> 1335.6000000000001
it

1331.84 --> 1337.6789999999999
needs time to settle in

1335.6 --> 1339.4399999999998
right but is it then silly for them to

1337.679 --> 1341.52
kind of like

1339.44 --> 1343.76
wonder try out

1341.52 --> 1346.32
an idea of what they might be doing how

1343.76 --> 1348.559
they might be ending up no and at the

1346.32 --> 1348.559
same

1349.12 --> 1355.4399999999998
the same goes for

1350.96 --> 1358.4
trying to wonder what could be beyond

1355.44 --> 1361.1200000000001
the regions that we know

1358.4 --> 1363.2800000000002
and getting into the mechanics

1361.12 --> 1365.36
just like what might be possible i don't

1363.28 --> 1369.24
think that's silly at all

1365.36 --> 1369.24
i think it's very stimulating

1384.799 --> 1390.96
i don't know steamy traveler

1388.08 --> 1390.96
i don't think so

1391.679 --> 1396.3200000000002
he might be responding to seed planting

1396.48 --> 1399.84
i'm not maybe it was

1398.24 --> 1402.64
i don't know don't

1399.84 --> 1404.08
don't talk to adam like that

1402.64 --> 1408.159
adam

1404.08 --> 1412.24
like he's with with me and with us

1408.159 --> 1416.0
in this ex mind exploratory journey so

1412.24 --> 1418.64
it deserves a little respect

1416.0 --> 1419.679
unless that was english humor again i

1418.64 --> 1421.919
don't know

1419.679 --> 1424.72
you'd have to ask adam i

1421.919 --> 1424.72
don't get that

1428.96 --> 1431.8400000000001
uh

1440.72 --> 1444.4
40 huge container ships waiting to be

1442.64 --> 1445.8400000000001
unloaded in l.a like

1444.4 --> 1447.2
how

1445.84 --> 1450.6399999999999
like who is

1447.2 --> 1450.64
who is in control of that

1451.679 --> 1454.96
how how

1452.799 --> 1457.679
has it come to that point seeking star

1454.96 --> 1460.4
wars that 40 huge container ships are

1457.679 --> 1460.4
just waiting

1460.48 --> 1464.799
is it because they don't have enough

1462.0 --> 1464.799
dock workers

1467.6 --> 1472.48
is it because the management is so

1469.76 --> 1474.24
terrible that they just don't respond to

1472.48 --> 1476.96
everybody quitting their job because

1474.24 --> 1480.0
they have to take a v

1476.96 --> 1480.0
or wear a mask

1481.279 --> 1487.36
like those people should be

1485.039 --> 1490.8799999999999
like rate it

1487.36 --> 1494.0
and like okay you're out of here you are

1490.88 --> 1496.88
you're literally sabotaging

1494.0 --> 1499.039
like national interest you're sabotaging

1496.88 --> 1500.72
national interest you are going to be

1499.039 --> 1503.279
forcefully removed now and we will

1500.72 --> 1503.279
appoint

1503.919 --> 1508.0800000000002
somebody that will resolve this

1506.08 --> 1510.559
situation

1508.08 --> 1514.76
that's that would be my preliminary

1510.559 --> 1514.76
advice about that

1516.799 --> 1523.96
no truckers hmm

1519.039 --> 1523.96
but that seems very unlikely though

1534.4 --> 1539.039
i mean is there like an unusual amount

1536.48 --> 1541.679
of truckers

1539.039 --> 1542.96
that are have resigned their job that

1541.679 --> 1545.679
have resigned their

1542.96 --> 1548.559
personal company as a trucker

1545.679 --> 1548.5590000000002
for some reason

1548.96 --> 1552.52
i don't see it

1562.799 --> 1566.32
classical homeopath okay

1567.2 --> 1572.0800000000002
british people to be very serious and

1569.52 --> 1574.48
uptight yeah but that's why their humor

1572.08 --> 1577.1999999999998
is like that it's because

1574.48 --> 1578.24
of that very serious and uptight other

1577.2 --> 1579.8400000000001
side

1578.24 --> 1582.64
see

1579.84 --> 1585.279
like that's why the humor is like that

1582.64 --> 1588.4
because of that

1585.279 --> 1588.4
classical homeopath

1594.48 --> 1600.08
controlled food no but that's that

1597.039 --> 1603.36
seeking that's just like oh this is my

1600.08 --> 1607.039
divining motivation why it's happening

1603.36 --> 1607.039
you don't know why it's happening

1608.88 --> 1615.44
what's causing the hold up

1613.039 --> 1619.84
you can't conjure a motive until you

1615.44 --> 1619.8400000000001
know what's actually causing the hold up

1622.799 --> 1625.799
huh

1626.36 --> 1629.4799999999998
[Music]

1631.039 --> 1634.8799999999999
right yeah you see classical homeopath

1633.36 --> 1636.6399999999999
exactly

1634.88 --> 1639.44
because

1636.64 --> 1643.039
when a lot when like a lot of the the

1639.44 --> 1645.52
folk spirit is serious and uptight

1643.039 --> 1648.1589999999999
it's gonna be very tough

1645.52 --> 1649.52
to loosen that up which is what humor

1648.159 --> 1653.44
does right

1649.52 --> 1653.44
and that's why they got to be very

1653.6 --> 1659.52
like almost weaponized they got to be

1656.0 --> 1662.0
sharp and hard edged to get through to

1659.52 --> 1665.039
those types of people that are very

1662.0 --> 1665.039
serious and uptight

1666.72 --> 1670.3990000000001
this is all internal mechanics

1671.36 --> 1674.32
spirit mechanics

1680.08 --> 1684.32
there are sovietizing dude

1686.0 --> 1689.12
yes

1687.12 --> 1690.9599999999998
just communism is coming out of the

1689.12 --> 1694.279
closet

1690.96 --> 1694.279
in the usa

1719.44 --> 1724.1200000000001
what's an easy way to debunk gravity

1725.44 --> 1730.799
have those that use it

1727.84 --> 1735.52
and claim it so such a key

1730.799 --> 1735.52
actually define it and then source it

1735.76 --> 1740.1589999999999
see it

1736.84 --> 1742.32
planting they'll find that there's a lot

1740.159 --> 1744.0
of like colloquial

1742.32 --> 1746.1589999999999
applications

1744.0 --> 1747.84
mostly grounded in mathematical

1746.159 --> 1749.6000000000001
convenience

1747.84 --> 1752.08
in how people deal with gravity right

1749.6 --> 1753.6789999999999
the little g it's calculation it's such

1752.08 --> 1754.8799999999999
a quick system oh

1753.679 --> 1758.3200000000002
you don't have to think about a whole

1754.88 --> 1763.2
lot of things that like that fortunately

1758.32 --> 1763.2
an official physics-based definition

1763.279 --> 1770.48
is a little bit more elusive

1767.12 --> 1770.4799999999998
highly controversial

1771.52 --> 1776.12
gravity is mostly just assumed

1780.0 --> 1785.64
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

1798.64 --> 1804.0
yes a sleeping warrior

1802.08 --> 1807.84
it's merely in effect but the point is

1804.0 --> 1809.52
though that's only when science is made

1807.84 --> 1812.0
is

1809.52 --> 1815.039
forwarded in an argument as a scientific

1812.0 --> 1815.039
claim right

1816.08 --> 1820.84
i think more to the point is

1818.88 --> 1823.6000000000001
define what it

1820.84 --> 1826.08
is and then

1823.6 --> 1828.799
once that's cleared up back it with

1826.08 --> 1830.24
physical scientific evidence scientific

1828.799 --> 1833.36
inquiry

1830.24 --> 1835.679
right the point is ballers people that

1833.36 --> 1837.9189999999999
believe in gravity they never really

1835.679 --> 1839.919
gotten to that point they

1837.919 --> 1842.48
there's so much to work with the

1839.919 --> 1844.24
conception of gravity is so much to work

1842.48 --> 1848.08
with

1844.24 --> 1850.72
they'd never really even need to go for

1848.08 --> 1853.9189999999999
that for their own use to figure out

1850.72 --> 1853.919
whether it's really real

1854.08 --> 1859.8799999999999
hello moonshadow

1856.48 --> 1859.88
moby styles

1869.279 --> 1875.679
right conceptual space time

1872.24 --> 1878.64
right but hey even in recent times

1875.679 --> 1881.44
some signs stick fiction enthusiasts

1878.64 --> 1882.5590000000002
have actually attempted to try to reify

1881.44 --> 1884.24
it

1882.559 --> 1887.279
into

1884.24 --> 1889.279
having been physically proven me

1887.279 --> 1890.84
included

1889.279 --> 1893.84
just for the fun of

1890.84 --> 1895.84
it on the flat earth debates

1893.84 --> 1899.399
i saw the show again yesterday was a

1895.84 --> 1899.399
very good show

1908.08 --> 1911.08
hmm

1944.24 --> 1946.559
hmm

1947.039 --> 1952.399
does bob believe he's proof which bob

1950.88 --> 1956.44
one father unit

1952.399 --> 1956.4399999999998
got to be a little bit more specific

1978.0 --> 1981.76
someone told me scientists

1980.88 --> 1983.8400000000001
that

1981.76 --> 1985.84
that's

1983.84 --> 1989.1999999999998
like that sentence

1985.84 --> 1989.1999999999998
george law learn

1989.279 --> 1992.32
i don't know how to pronounce that

1990.799 --> 1994.8799999999999
george

1992.32 --> 1998.8799999999999
that sentence if they literally said

1994.88 --> 1998.88
that that is so ridiculous

1999.96 --> 2004.799
scientists able to take pictures of

2002.559 --> 2007.36
black holes like

2004.799 --> 2010.399
okay so how about

2007.36 --> 2012.7199999999998
somebody just anybody taking a picture

2010.399 --> 2015.6
of a black hole why would it have to be

2012.72 --> 2016.88
scientists

2015.6 --> 2019.36
that is

2016.88 --> 2020.64
really odd thing to say

2019.36 --> 2023.36
that makes

2020.64 --> 2024.72
the scientists in that

2023.36 --> 2027.4399999999998
context

2024.72 --> 2029.76
kind of sound more like a priesthood

2027.44 --> 2031.3600000000001
than actually somebody that applies to

2029.76 --> 2033.44
scientific method

2031.36 --> 2036.1589999999999
it's a really odd thing to say in my

2033.44 --> 2038.64
opinion it just feels like there's

2036.159 --> 2040.72
something weird about it

2038.64 --> 2042.7990000000002
this is when you say it like that

2040.72 --> 2045.3600000000001
scientists are able to take pictures of

2042.799 --> 2048.96
black holes what

2045.36 --> 2051.2799999999997
oh so the scientists are able to do that

2048.96 --> 2054.32
but anybody out there other than

2051.28 --> 2054.32
scientists aren't

2055.44 --> 2060.76
with modern camera technology

2057.76 --> 2060.76
um

2062.24 --> 2070.52
sounds like machinations allow them the

2065.879 --> 2070.52
scientists to do that

2075.599 --> 2079.3590000000004
because they have special telescopes

2077.679 --> 2083.44
yeah yeah i know they have special

2079.359 --> 2083.44
telescopes very special

2083.679 --> 2089.2400000000002
it's a leading edge of cinematography at

2086.24 --> 2089.24
work

2105.04 --> 2108.32
hey ryan leakey

2109.44 --> 2113.56
welcome to this chat

2135.28 --> 2138.28
ah

2144.8 --> 2147.8
um

2160.0 --> 2165.359
hey by the way

2162.64 --> 2168.72
pretends nathan nathan oakley and adam

2165.359 --> 2172.92
are in chat here i have a question

2168.72 --> 2172.9199999999996
about music copywriting

2173.359 --> 2176.96
like online

2174.8 --> 2179.6800000000003
like is there some kind of a time limit

2176.96 --> 2182.64
specifically on music

2179.68 --> 2184.56
before it becomes uh what is it again

2182.64 --> 2187.7999999999997
basically free

2184.56 --> 2187.7999999999997
for anybody

2189.44 --> 2193.839
is that like 50 years or is it 20 years

2192.0 --> 2196.0
or does it depend because there's a

2193.839 --> 2199.2
certain video game

2196.0 --> 2201.04
which i am a massive fan of

2199.2 --> 2203.839
and i think that they've

2201.04 --> 2206.72
they're basically over 20 years old now

2203.839 --> 2209.2
so i'm wondering like would i be just

2206.72 --> 2210.24
allowed to use music from that video

2209.2 --> 2215.0789999999997
game

2210.24 --> 2215.0789999999997
without ever getting copyright strikes

2215.92 --> 2219.6800000000003
public domain right

2217.68 --> 2222.3199999999997
that that's the word i was looking for

2219.68 --> 2225.359
free for all

2222.32 --> 2225.3590000000004
i'm just wondering

2227.119 --> 2230.8
because there's like about

2229.68 --> 2234.3999999999996
what is it

2230.8 --> 2237.119
60 to 100 very short songs that are

2234.4 --> 2241.839
extremely atmospheric

2237.119 --> 2244.8
and very much in line of what i like

2241.839 --> 2244.7999999999997
lots of brass

2245.119 --> 2249.6800000000003
and some violins and piano and great

2248.48 --> 2252.4
stuff

2249.68 --> 2256.839
that i just i have that [ __ ] echoing in

2252.4 --> 2256.839
my head constantly so i was wondering

2258.72 --> 2264.16
i mean there are people that are

2260.48 --> 2265.44
literally just having the entire music

2264.16 --> 2267.68
record

2265.44 --> 2268.839
out there on youtube

2267.68 --> 2272.3999999999996
just like

2268.839 --> 2272.4
that but

2275.76 --> 2281.8390000000004
yeah no copyright on nsync songs ew

2279.68 --> 2283.52
you're getting a timeout for that

2281.839 --> 2284.4
now you're getting just removed that's

2283.52 --> 2286.88
disgusting

2284.4 --> 2286.88
jason

2287.2 --> 2293.96
jason you're trash

2290.16 --> 2293.96
hey you know it

2312.079 --> 2317.119
andrew asks

2314.64 --> 2320.16
does a magnet disprove

2317.119 --> 2322.7200000000003
that mass never attracted mass

2320.16 --> 2326.7999999999997
no it doesn't disprove that because it's

2322.72 --> 2329.2
not the mass that attracts anything

2326.8 --> 2330.48
it's the magnetic field

2329.2 --> 2332.8799999999997
that does that

2330.48 --> 2337.56
there's no mass

2332.88 --> 2337.56
causing that attraction of magnetism

2344.48 --> 2347.48
hmm

2358.64 --> 2361.64
uh

2368.8 --> 2371.52
oh [ __ ]

2373.92 --> 2377.92
wow okay well by that table

2378.0 --> 2381.2
that would mean never

2381.68 --> 2385.359
so

2382.72 --> 2387.1189999999997
70 years after the death of the author

2385.359 --> 2388.96
well i think he's still alive and i

2387.119 --> 2390.079
don't want him to die

2388.96 --> 2393.359
that means

2390.079 --> 2393.3590000000004
that's going to be never

2394.079 --> 2397.2000000000003
i

2395.119 --> 2398.8
of course i could potentially you kind

2397.2 --> 2401.04
of like

2398.8 --> 2403.44
email them and ask

2401.04 --> 2407.7599999999998
i don't know

2403.44 --> 2409.52
no idea what he thinks about flat earth

2407.76 --> 2414.6400000000003
might be like no

2409.52 --> 2417.96
you can specifically never use my music

2414.64 --> 2417.96
i don't know

2439.52 --> 2441.839
yeah

2442.0 --> 2446.4
but it's

2443.839 --> 2448.88
it's kind of weird though because

2446.4 --> 2451.119
like i've heard

2448.88 --> 2453.599
baldur's gate one

2451.119 --> 2455.6800000000003
song actually like the

2453.599 --> 2458.4
the startup song

2455.68 --> 2460.64
they played that like over at infowars

2458.4 --> 2463.2000000000003
like multiple times it's just that one

2460.64 --> 2463.2
song though

2464.72 --> 2468.319
that like that really stood out to me

2466.8 --> 2471.2000000000003
every time it's like they play that it's

2468.319 --> 2473.44
like what oh is it character creation

2471.2 --> 2475.5989999999997
time again because that's like the song

2473.44 --> 2477.04
you always hear over and over again as

2475.599 --> 2478.839
you try to

2477.04 --> 2482.16
re-roll your stats

2478.839 --> 2483.2799999999997
and get the stats you want for your

2482.16 --> 2485.1189999999997
character that you're going to be

2483.28 --> 2487.2000000000003
playing

2485.119 --> 2489.839
this it's that song

2487.2 --> 2492.64
so it i have heard it out there it's not

2489.839 --> 2495.52
like i haven't heard it ever anywhere

2492.64 --> 2497.839
but then again alex jones

2495.52 --> 2500.48
and his crew do kind of like drag in a

2497.839 --> 2505.0789999999997
lot of high profile music and they

2500.48 --> 2505.079
probably do pay for it as well so

2528.24 --> 2530.4799999999996
hmm

2533.76 --> 2538.2400000000002
it's well within the refraction results

2536.64 --> 2540.56
oh

2538.24 --> 2543.04
a terrestrial refraction oh yeah but

2540.56 --> 2545.52
then he doesn't have any r value

2543.04 --> 2549.7599999999998
that he by the way needs in order to

2545.52 --> 2552.24
have the terrestrial refraction formula

2549.76 --> 2552.2400000000002
rubbles

2553.119 --> 2556.7200000000003
right yeah of course all black sword

2554.96 --> 2558.88
terrestrial fraction oh yeah then you'd

2556.72 --> 2560.7999999999997
have no r value

2558.88 --> 2562.7200000000003
then you could have never established

2560.8 --> 2565.52
the radius value of earth through

2562.72 --> 2569.1189999999997
measurement in order to use it in the

2565.52 --> 2570.72
calculation of terrestrial refraction

2569.119 --> 2573.52
it's a paradox

2570.72 --> 2573.52
daniel rubbles

2574.88 --> 2580.1600000000003
it's yeah i've

2576.96 --> 2582.88
i've dedicated several shows in the not

2580.16 --> 2584.96
too distant past

2582.88 --> 2587.599
like a few weeks ago

2584.96 --> 2591.2
named after that and then i i talk about

2587.599 --> 2592.4
it elaborately it's it's just that

2591.2 --> 2595.04
right

2592.4 --> 2598.1600000000003
you got the black swan

2595.04 --> 2599.599
oh terrestrial refraction okay so light

2598.16 --> 2600.48
is bending

2599.599 --> 2603.44
oh

2600.48 --> 2605.52
you don't have an r value

2603.44 --> 2608.2400000000002
you can't have the r value even to make

2605.52 --> 2609.2
that claim oh okay so i guess light is

2608.24 --> 2613.4399999999996
straight

2609.2 --> 2615.7599999999998
okay then you go back to the black swan

2613.44 --> 2617.04
the geometry is defiled

2615.76 --> 2618.7200000000003
and then oh you're going to bend it

2617.04 --> 2621.44
again in your mind and say well maybe

2618.72 --> 2623.52
terrestrial refraction anyway oh well

2621.44 --> 2625.359
that's very cute but then you end up

2623.52 --> 2626.8
with the same problem you have no r

2625.359 --> 2629.359
value

2626.8 --> 2631.44
established to use

2629.359 --> 2633.359
to make the terrestrial refraction

2631.44 --> 2635.92
formula

2633.359 --> 2637.2799999999997
right it's an endless

2635.92 --> 2638.2400000000002
wheel

2637.28 --> 2640.5600000000004
three

2638.24 --> 2642.3999999999996
point argument wheel

2640.56 --> 2645.68
and they can never get out

2642.4 --> 2649.839
it's the wheel of death for the globals

2645.68 --> 2649.839
it's the trinity of their doom

2664.56 --> 2668.92
yeah

2665.44 --> 2668.92
i hope that helps

2695.2 --> 2698.2
do

2709.359 --> 2715.839
oh god jason mccormack that's that's

2712.319 --> 2716.96
just a a fluke of the system i had not

2715.839 --> 2719.7599999999998
actually

2716.96 --> 2722.4
intended to say bye bye

2719.76 --> 2724.48
because of a freaking nsync song because

2722.4 --> 2726.2400000000002
i don't remember that

2724.48 --> 2728.48
i don't remember that because i don't

2726.24 --> 2731.1189999999997
want to remember

2728.48 --> 2735.04
nsync is one of the things that i very

2731.119 --> 2738.1600000000003
very actively white noised the [ __ ] out

2735.04 --> 2740.319
of you know why because in the time that

2738.16 --> 2742.96
i actually did do work

2740.319 --> 2747.359
like at cafeterias and [ __ ]

2742.96 --> 2750.7200000000003
i had to listen to that [ __ ] [ __ ]

2747.359 --> 2753.119
literally erase the very patterns from

2750.72 --> 2754.0
my mind including people's responses

2753.119 --> 2757.28
like

2754.0 --> 2759.2
i refuse to acknowledge this exists

2757.28 --> 2760.6400000000003
[ __ ] you nsync

2759.2 --> 2763.04
[ __ ] you

2760.64 --> 2766.4
so i don't remember it

2763.04 --> 2768.88
i don't see that oh look oh he said

2766.4 --> 2770.2400000000002
something that is in there i

2768.88 --> 2771.76
it's not there

2770.24 --> 2774.7999999999997
it's gone

2771.76 --> 2777.2000000000003
i erased it from my mind because it

2774.8 --> 2777.2000000000003
sucks

2777.359 --> 2782.64
and it's not freaking funny everybody

2780.16 --> 2785.1189999999997
that likes that things it's funny i

2782.64 --> 2789.16
don't think it's funny i think it's just

2785.119 --> 2789.1600000000003
annoying and gay

2812.079 --> 2816.48
see

2813.119 --> 2818.079
i brian leakey i know that you think

2816.48 --> 2820.72
that's funny because

2818.079 --> 2823.599
it's probably in a song

2820.72 --> 2826.8799999999997
but i wouldn't know

2823.599 --> 2828.079
literally i recognize that you recognize

2826.88 --> 2831.599
it from it

2828.079 --> 2834.7200000000003
but i don't because it's not in there

2831.599 --> 2837.76
i'm blissfully ignorant of those shitty

2834.72 --> 2837.7599999999998
shitty songs

2840.079 --> 2845.599
like the only sample ever that i even

2842.559 --> 2847.2000000000003
hear of nsync in my mind is that stupid

2845.599 --> 2850.1600000000003
bye bye bye

2847.2 --> 2853.1189999999997
that's like the only two seconds that i

2850.16 --> 2854.7999999999997
can remember just to remind myself how

2853.119 --> 2856.8
[ __ ] annoying that whole thing is and

2854.8 --> 2860.079
why it was so worth it to completely

2856.8 --> 2860.079
erase it from my mind

2866.48 --> 2872.559
yeah i'm gonna give you a timeout now

2868.72 --> 2874.7999999999997
you're you're doing this on purpose

2872.559 --> 2877.599
you will get up getting you will end up

2874.8 --> 2881.6800000000003
getting banned again jason mccormack

2877.599 --> 2884.319
you're slowly driving towards that cliff

2881.68 --> 2885.68
once again you're doing it

2884.319 --> 2886.96
you did that

2885.68 --> 2890.16
years ago

2886.96 --> 2892.96
it ended up in you maniacally spamming

2890.16 --> 2895.2799999999997
your crap all over my chat and

2892.96 --> 2898.16
everywhere else constantly like an

2895.28 --> 2900.4
insane maniac piece of [ __ ]

2898.16 --> 2901.68
it has absolutely no control over their

2900.4 --> 2903.76
actions

2901.68 --> 2908.5589999999997
and i get the feeling you're slowly

2903.76 --> 2908.559
driving towards that cliff again jason

2908.72 --> 2914.16
you're you're going there again jason

2911.76 --> 2915.3590000000004
can you feel it can you feel the edge

2914.16 --> 2918.5589999999997
coming

2915.359 --> 2920.4
can you feel ahead of time how when you

2918.559 --> 2923.2000000000003
go over that edge you're gonna be like

2920.4 --> 2926.64
in seeming free fall

2923.2 --> 2929.9199999999996
as you slowly curve towards

2926.64 --> 2931.2799999999997
the ground beneath the cliff

2929.92 --> 2933.04
in your truck

2931.28 --> 2934.48
can you feel it

2933.04 --> 2939.4
you might wanna

2934.48 --> 2939.4
actually pull those brakes right now

2942.0 --> 2947.359
yeah and you're getting a timeout too

2943.839 --> 2950.359
it's no more of this [ __ ] here thanks

2947.359 --> 2950.359
andrew

2964.4 --> 2970.92
good to see you i i noticed you in chat

2967.92 --> 2970.92
yesterday

2971.839 --> 2977.119
over at jose's

2973.92 --> 2977.119
thanks for the encouragement

2980.16 --> 2984.8799999999997
although dude i i take it it's a dude or

2983.52 --> 2986.72
you chick

2984.88 --> 2989.359
i hope you're not actually a mask

2986.72 --> 2990.72
wearing chick that would be

2989.359 --> 2992.88
shameful

2990.72 --> 2992.8799999999997
but

2993.52 --> 2997.28
like wow you're actually hanging out in

2995.92 --> 2999.839
there or

2997.28 --> 2999.8390000000004
poof

3000.319 --> 3003.359
the chat was hard dude

3002.319 --> 3004.48
or

3003.359 --> 3005.68
yeah

3004.48 --> 3008.16
whatever

3005.68 --> 3009.5989999999997
that chat has always been powerful it's

3008.16 --> 3012.8799999999997
always

3009.599 --> 3016.2400000000002
it's always been gutter trash always it

3012.88 --> 3021.319
was always like a third world

3016.24 --> 3021.319
trashy hang around place always

3036.4 --> 3040.319
all right

3037.28 --> 3041.28
but hey i hope i lightened it up a

3040.319 --> 3044.7599999999998
little

3041.28 --> 3044.76
with my appearance

3055.599 --> 3058.599
hmm

3064.6 --> 3068.2999999999997
[Music]

3077.04 --> 3080.24
all right so yeah with twitch since you

3078.96 --> 3082.319
were there

3080.24 --> 3084.24
kind of have your opinion what did you

3082.319 --> 3086.64
think about it what did you think about

3084.24 --> 3089.04
what i did also how well did i come

3086.64 --> 3092.319
through because i couldn't hear it

3089.04 --> 3094.8
i was on discord i didn't get the sense

3092.319 --> 3096.64
that discord was giving me issues making

3094.8 --> 3098.88
me zone out

3096.64 --> 3102.72
which happens a lot

3098.88 --> 3104.8
like yeah and other discord channels

3102.72 --> 3109.64
but what did you think

3104.8 --> 3109.6400000000003
about the arguments i put down

3117.2 --> 3124.72
like i even suspended my normal

3121.52 --> 3126.8
silly voices that i would make

3124.72 --> 3128.72
that i typically like to do here on my

3126.8 --> 3130.7200000000003
show when i

3128.72 --> 3132.8799999999997
basically have to tell somebody

3130.72 --> 3134.9599999999996
something really basic that they

3132.88 --> 3137.28
absolutely should be know i like was

3134.96 --> 3139.44
perfectly dry in my explanations this is

3137.28 --> 3142.2400000000002
very unusual that's a rare thing when

3139.44 --> 3143.76
arwen is perfectly

3142.24 --> 3145.7599999999998
without

3143.76 --> 3147.0400000000004
theatrics

3145.76 --> 3149.44
that's rare

3147.04 --> 3152.7599999999998
and i did it there it was dead serious

3149.44 --> 3152.76
dead serious

3166.88 --> 3173.52
but he saw this eq mount what what's an

3170.48 --> 3173.52
eq mount

3173.76 --> 3176.76
what

3187.76 --> 3193.079
i unicorn laser eyes by the way you saw

3189.92 --> 3193.079
it too

3195.599 --> 3200.6400000000003
of course hawkins was admitted hawkins

3197.92 --> 3203.52
is always outmatched especially when

3200.64 --> 3206.5589999999997
he's actually being held to

3203.52 --> 3208.64
a clear-cut format where he won't

3206.559 --> 3211.44
be allowed to interrupt

3208.64 --> 3213.2
right when he actually holds to that and

3211.44 --> 3214.559
isn't just like oh i'm going to rumpus

3213.2 --> 3216.48
anyway or something

3214.559 --> 3217.76
yeah he's going to be outmatched by

3216.48 --> 3219.2
pretty much

3217.76 --> 3221.5200000000004
everyone

3219.2 --> 3224.5589999999997
everyone including most other ballers

3221.52 --> 3227.2
because he is legitimately

3224.559 --> 3227.2000000000003
[ __ ]

3229.28 --> 3233.0400000000004
probably by his own doing

3234.88 --> 3240.96
very unhealthy things

3237.839 --> 3240.96
he's done in the past

3242.319 --> 3248.079
i got i did go good oh you were in there

3245.119 --> 3248.079
too ryan leaky

3248.8 --> 3253.119
broke up the monotony for a bit yeah

3250.559 --> 3254.7200000000003
yeah that that for sure absolutely

3253.119 --> 3257.6800000000003
that's what i do

3254.72 --> 3257.68
when i get in there

3258.72 --> 3262.5589999999997
i but

3260.4 --> 3265.04
what did you think of my uh

3262.559 --> 3266.4
my little intro

3265.04 --> 3269.68
like

3266.4 --> 3271.359
jose did give me like 30 seconds

3269.68 --> 3275.64
and i

3271.359 --> 3275.64
oh did i roast him oh

3287.119 --> 3291.599
if they explore the arguments they

3289.04 --> 3294.079
become flat earth yep they are anti-flat

3291.599 --> 3294.079
earthers

3295.359 --> 3299.5989999999997
but

3296.4 --> 3301.839
not necessarily all of them though

3299.599 --> 3302.88
right people like rumpus are anti-flat

3301.839 --> 3306.0
earthers

3302.88 --> 3311.04
for sure they have no limits

3306.0 --> 3313.68
but there are still guys among them

3311.04 --> 3316.24
that are just

3313.68 --> 3318.96
playing the game

3316.24 --> 3322.24
it's more like deep ballers deep fake

3318.96 --> 3325.2
ballers they just

3322.24 --> 3327.1189999999997
that that because that is how i was too

3325.2 --> 3328.96
right that's a mechanism that actually

3327.119 --> 3331.359
works when you're a believer in that

3328.96 --> 3333.04
stuff and you get the patterns of how it

3331.359 --> 3334.799
works

3333.04 --> 3336.799
i had that too

3334.799 --> 3340.64
and it didn't make me an anti-flat

3336.799 --> 3342.799
earther it just made me

3340.64 --> 3343.68
indiscourageable

3342.799 --> 3347.04
ball

3343.68 --> 3348.8799999999997
earth enthusiast like you couldn't stop

3347.04 --> 3351.599
me it's like yeah

3348.88 --> 3353.76
okay yeah yeah that might absolutely

3351.599 --> 3356.0
dispel the whole thing

3353.76 --> 3358.7200000000003
i'm still gonna build though i'm because

3356.0 --> 3358.72
i love this

3359.68 --> 3366.72
and i still believe in it because i

3362.319 --> 3368.64
magical thinking wise belief that

3366.72 --> 3371.359
our collective minds

3368.64 --> 3372.799
would basically be the wish

3371.359 --> 3376.16
that god

3372.799 --> 3378.16
would eventually then use to make it the

3376.16 --> 3380.0789999999997
reality that's really where that went

3378.16 --> 3382.64
magical thinking wise

3380.079 --> 3385.44
right really believing that

3382.64 --> 3388.0789999999997
that you if we can figure it out then

3385.44 --> 3389.04
god will make it real

3388.079 --> 3392.559
it's

3389.04 --> 3393.7599999999998
bizarre really in retrospect

3392.559 --> 3395.2000000000003
but it worked

3393.76 --> 3397.3590000000004
and it made me

3395.2 --> 3399.68
not into an anti-flat earther and

3397.359 --> 3401.7599999999998
definitely made me not hate flat

3399.68 --> 3402.72
earthers i never

3401.76 --> 3406.0
never

3402.72 --> 3408.0
ever disrespected them if somebody would

3406.0 --> 3409.839
point it out to me i would be like yes i

3408.0 --> 3412.96
get it i get it

3409.839 --> 3415.599
i'm still going to continue this dream

3412.96 --> 3418.079
i'm not done here yet literally like

3415.599 --> 3419.599
feeling like the dimensional barriers

3418.079 --> 3421.52
it's like

3419.599 --> 3422.559
yes yes i know you're there i know

3421.52 --> 3425.44
you're

3422.559 --> 3427.6800000000003
up that staircase like two steps

3425.44 --> 3429.92
i can't go there yet i have to finish

3427.68 --> 3429.9199999999996
this

3431.52 --> 3435.44
that's what would happen back then

3445.2 --> 3452.16
yeah brian licky oh there's a weird

3449.119 --> 3454.88
thing between me and jose

3452.16 --> 3459.2
like despite everything i can't help but

3454.88 --> 3459.2000000000003
kind of like him and i think it's mutual

3459.44 --> 3464.559
but it's never going to be a trustworthy

3462.24 --> 3466.24
kind of bond

3464.559 --> 3469.0400000000004
but it's just like

3466.24 --> 3471.04
i get him and i think in a way he gets

3469.04 --> 3473.2799999999997
me like he gets

3471.04 --> 3475.68
i get some parts of how he does things

3473.28 --> 3478.559
creatively and he gets that part about

3475.68 --> 3482.0789999999997
me too and that's very rare by the way

3478.559 --> 3485.3590000000004
that people get that part especially

3482.079 --> 3487.52
on the opponent's side most people

3485.359 --> 3488.5589999999997
on the anti-flat earther side don't

3487.52 --> 3491.2
understand

3488.559 --> 3492.799
me whatsoever

3491.2 --> 3494.24
they get hung up

3492.799 --> 3496.799
by my

3494.24 --> 3498.72
oddness

3496.799 --> 3501.2
it's a trap

3498.72 --> 3503.68
makes them not see beyond

3501.2 --> 3505.68
you can because you understand the full

3503.68 --> 3508.24
context they don't so they get hung up

3505.68 --> 3510.3999999999996
by the distractions it works

3508.24 --> 3512.5589999999997
it's so basic

3510.4 --> 3515.04
i don't even plan it it's just something

3512.559 --> 3517.44
i naturally do

3515.04 --> 3520.4
always been like that that's me it's

3517.44 --> 3522.96
always been me doing it like that it's

3520.4 --> 3525.44
how i developed social interaction at a

3522.96 --> 3527.76
very young age it's the first way

3525.44 --> 3530.96
to express myself starting towards my

3527.76 --> 3533.3590000000004
parents that's how i am

3530.96 --> 3536.0
and it has a function but i didn't know

3533.359 --> 3538.0
that originally i just went intuitively

3536.0 --> 3540.079
like

3538.0 --> 3541.68
this way i can express it this way i can

3540.079 --> 3544.6400000000003
build

3541.68 --> 3547.52
and yeah some will like it

3544.64 --> 3548.4
get closer others will hate me for it

3547.52 --> 3550.64
that's

3548.4 --> 3552.64
like those were the rules socially for

3550.64 --> 3556.64
me at a very young age that's how that

3552.64 --> 3556.64
worked originally hey what are you doing

3557.68 --> 3561.839
jose is a good guy why are you timing

3560.4 --> 3563.44
with twit out

3561.839 --> 3567.0
the menu

3563.44 --> 3567.0
why are you doing that

3574.559 --> 3578.48
yeah jose is a good guy he's not a good

3577.359 --> 3579.68
guy

3578.48 --> 3582.72
he is a

3579.68 --> 3586.5589999999997
jovial guy it's a difference he's not a

3582.72 --> 3589.04
good guy he's jovial

3586.559 --> 3592.1600000000003
that means that wherever he dwells he

3589.04 --> 3594.5589999999997
always somehow managed to find some good

3592.16 --> 3597.1189999999997
creative spirit

3594.559 --> 3598.96
but he goes into shitty places and

3597.119 --> 3600.48
that's why he's kind of a third world

3598.96 --> 3603.119
trash

3600.48 --> 3604.72
he just goes there

3603.119 --> 3607.2000000000003
he does that

3604.72 --> 3612.04
maybe there is some personal religious

3607.2 --> 3612.04
motivation behind his methods

3614.88 --> 3621.76
but he's not a good guy he's a jovial

3617.44 --> 3621.76
guy it's a very distinct difference

3624.48 --> 3627.68
hey mandy young why did you time up to

3626.799 --> 3629.839
it with

3627.68 --> 3629.839
why

3651.119 --> 3654.28
all right

3657.44 --> 3661.359
yes brian leaky but i did round it out

3660.079 --> 3664.0
on

3661.359 --> 3665.92
on giving in compliments right i would

3664.0 --> 3668.88
never just

3665.92 --> 3671.839
go that hard on somebody and then not

3668.88 --> 3674.4
end ended up with but here is here's

3671.839 --> 3674.4
some hope

3674.799 --> 3679.52
i would never allow myself to cut off

3677.28 --> 3684.3590000000004
something like that

3679.52 --> 3684.359
without at least giving a counterweight

3703.52 --> 3706.839
thank you

3714.0 --> 3717.68
being obnoxious

3715.76 --> 3719.92
i'm sorry but that's not a good enough

3717.68 --> 3724.2
reason to just time somebody out i'm

3719.92 --> 3724.2000000000003
revoking your wrench amanda

3726.0 --> 3730.359
you're interrupting my conversation

3752.079 --> 3755.079
uh

3777.76 --> 3783.8390000000004
oh daniel rubbles

3780.48 --> 3783.839
i missed your comment

3787.52 --> 3793.119
posted about vacuum

3789.839 --> 3793.119
require container

3797.2 --> 3802.5589999999997
yeah gravity container and then yeah you

3799.839 --> 3805.0389999999998
go to like how is gravity gonna do that

3802.559 --> 3807.119
how does gravity actually do that

3805.039 --> 3808.7200000000003
it can't right even if you start

3807.119 --> 3810.799
assuming with

3808.72 --> 3812.48
certain elements about gravity you're

3810.799 --> 3814.799
like oh it's a pushing or pulling first

3812.48 --> 3815.599
oh really so how's that polar push going

3814.799 --> 3817.599
to

3815.599 --> 3820.88
prevent the gas from

3817.599 --> 3825.7200000000003
keep moving and pushing against itself

3820.88 --> 3825.7200000000003
to expand in the infinite volume

3826.319 --> 3830.16
they have no response to that

3828.72 --> 3832.9599999999996
they don't

3830.16 --> 3834.64
they just start to claim abilities of

3832.96 --> 3837.52
gas

3834.64 --> 3839.1189999999997
like it's like a liquid like it just

3837.52 --> 3841.44
rests on the

3839.119 --> 3843.52
layer of slightly thicker they start to

3841.44 --> 3845.359
build delusional constructs about that

3843.52 --> 3848.799
and then say oh gradient see the

3845.359 --> 3850.48
gradient shows that pattern

3848.799 --> 3852.96
so i'm just going to assume that it's

3850.48 --> 3856.48
just laying on top of another layer on

3852.96 --> 3859.039
top of another layer like it is a liquid

3856.48 --> 3861.52
but that's absolutely ridiculous because

3859.039 --> 3863.8390000000004
gas is not a liquid it's unbonded it's

3861.52 --> 3866.799
going to expand in all directions

3863.839 --> 3869.7599999999998
and a slight nudge

3866.799 --> 3869.7599999999998
in some way

3869.92 --> 3874.319
it like think of it like this that's

3872.4 --> 3877.52
actually interesting right so if you

3874.319 --> 3878.839
have like a turbine right which what is

3877.52 --> 3881.68
it like

3878.839 --> 3884.24
magnetically pulls or pushes

3881.68 --> 3888.0789999999997
air through it right it pushes it right

3884.24 --> 3888.0789999999997
what if you use the turbine

3888.16 --> 3893.0
to try to keep

3890.0 --> 3893.0
gas

3894.24 --> 3898.9599999999996
inside of a container pressurized at all

3897.2 --> 3901.359
times

3898.96 --> 3903.839
i don't think that's gonna work

3901.359 --> 3905.7599999999998
like the gas is

3903.839 --> 3907.68
it might be bobbing back and forth but

3905.76 --> 3911.039
it's event like it's not really going to

3907.68 --> 3912.8799999999997
build much more pressure inside

3911.039 --> 3914.88
i think i don't know it's difficult but

3912.88 --> 3916.0
that would be close to some sort of a

3914.88 --> 3919.599
push

3916.0 --> 3920.839
like it it gas cannot be kept

3919.599 --> 3924.559
with a slight

3920.839 --> 3927.119
nudge toward a specific location exposed

3924.559 --> 3929.28
in all directions

3927.119 --> 3932.559
when there when the volume it is

3929.28 --> 3934.559
supposed to be able to move into is

3932.559 --> 3937.599
almost infinite

3934.559 --> 3941.119
because the more volume available for

3937.599 --> 3942.96
gas to expand into the more force in

3941.119 --> 3944.96
direct correlation to the amount of

3942.96 --> 3947.28
volume available

3944.96 --> 3949.92
it is going to expand with

3947.28 --> 3952.559
with that force equal to the amount of

3949.92 --> 3955.44
volume available which should be like

3952.559 --> 3957.44
an imaginable amount of force

3955.44 --> 3960.7200000000003
that's going to make it expand in all

3957.44 --> 3965.68
directions so how is this slight nudge

3960.72 --> 3969.48
going to keep it to that ball it can't

3965.68 --> 3969.48
that's where i would go

3987.28 --> 3993.44
yeah you have an astrophysics

3990.839 --> 3996.4
friend well that's hilarious yeah it is

3993.44 --> 3998.96
good to practice with absolutely

3996.4 --> 4000.88
if you can't stay civil if they're open

3998.96 --> 4005.64
for testing

4000.88 --> 4005.6400000000003
for contrary theories yeah

4018.4 --> 4023.359
thank you are and what

4021.119 --> 4028.52
you're welcome i guess although yeah

4023.359 --> 4028.52
really you need to thank me for being me

4039.359 --> 4044.0789999999997
yeah but sleeping you're sleeping worry

4041.359 --> 4047.52
we know that is like if you're going to

4044.079 --> 4049.6800000000003
enter university level stuff our

4047.52 --> 4051.839
university level arguments then yes

4049.68 --> 4055.2799999999997
sleeping warrior that's the way to go

4051.839 --> 4056.4
but i guarantee you that people daniel

4055.28 --> 4057.8390000000004
robes

4056.4 --> 4060.64
rubbles

4057.839 --> 4063.68
is talking to like on his forums text

4060.64 --> 4066.0789999999997
form are not going to be like that

4063.68 --> 4068.799
that's just random people that are like

4066.079 --> 4071.52
globers or anti-flat earthers they don't

4068.799 --> 4071.52
know that

4073.28 --> 4078.079
they don't know that

4075.119 --> 4080.079
they just think of gravity as that force

4078.079 --> 4082.2400000000002
they just know the colloquial gravity so

4080.079 --> 4084.7200000000003
you have to then explain

4082.24 --> 4086.319
don't bother them with but it's all

4084.72 --> 4089.0389999999998
turned inside out and it's all

4086.319 --> 4090.88
completely conjured nonsense yeah that's

4089.039 --> 4092.96
legitimate but it's going to be very

4090.88 --> 4094.7200000000003
confusing to them it's better to just

4092.96 --> 4097.04
explain

4094.72 --> 4099.839
within their presuppositions of gravity

4097.04 --> 4102.48
being this force and a nudge on gas

4099.839 --> 4104.5599999999995
that's just not sufficient it's not

4102.48 --> 4107.919999999999
sufficient

4104.56 --> 4110.799
right within their presupposed framework

4107.92 --> 4113.52
it doesn't work that's a much better

4110.799 --> 4116.0
approach to get to people that aren't

4113.52 --> 4120.2390000000005
ready to suddenly break open a can of

4116.0 --> 4120.239
university study you see

4120.56 --> 4124.88
the flaws are there within the

4122.48 --> 4128.3589999999995
colloquial beliefs all you have to do is

4124.88 --> 4128.359
point them out

4132.649 --> 4135.849
[Music]

4142.26 --> 4145.93
[Music]

4152.0 --> 4156.719
can the difference in gas pressure in

4154.0 --> 4158.799
the atmosphere create a container no

4156.719 --> 4159.52
no it can't

4158.799 --> 4162.96
no

4159.52 --> 4165.679
gradients gas pressure differences

4162.96 --> 4168.2390000000005
are always secondary to

4165.679 --> 4170.4
the volume of the available container

4168.239 --> 4172.5599999999995
having been filled

4170.4 --> 4174.799
and then other influences like

4172.56 --> 4176.4800000000005
temperatures

4174.799 --> 4178.08
can

4176.48 --> 4180.48
basically cause

4178.08 --> 4183.199
the established gas pressure that is

4180.48 --> 4185.599999999999
relatively stable because it has

4183.199 --> 4188.639999999999
finished up expanding in all directions

4185.6 --> 4190.96
to fill the available volume

4188.64 --> 4193.679
the other influences can then cause it

4190.96 --> 4196.0
to redivide itself in a gradient so

4193.679 --> 4199.92
gradient is always secondary

4196.0 --> 4202.88
to the gas pressure having filled

4199.92 --> 4205.04
every part of the available volume of

4202.88 --> 4208.4400000000005
the container space

4205.04 --> 4208.44
that's the condition

4235.84 --> 4240.64
the admin is an anti-flat earther

4238.48 --> 4243.599999999999
okay well just let him roll out his

4240.64 --> 4245.360000000001
machinations what i've just said

4243.6 --> 4248.4800000000005
will definitely

4245.36 --> 4250.4
make sense to those that actually assume

4248.48 --> 4254.718999999999
the colloquial

4250.4 --> 4254.719
beliefs about gas pressure and gravity

4255.84 --> 4259.6
right

4256.64 --> 4261.92
if you just make that point clear

4259.6 --> 4263.52
because it works in their mechanical

4261.92 --> 4264.96
framework

4263.52 --> 4267.120000000001
it works to

4264.96 --> 4269.679
roll that out because it just makes them

4267.12 --> 4271.36
think on basic mechanics

4269.679 --> 4273.52
and then spots

4271.36 --> 4276.32
that the entire train of thought didn't

4273.52 --> 4277.76
actually work out within their framework

4276.32 --> 4279.679
of thinking

4277.76 --> 4283.12
that's useful that's how you get the

4279.679 --> 4286.719
people that aren't ready to open up

4283.12 --> 4288.8
again of university study level

4286.719 --> 4290.96
reasoning

4288.8 --> 4293.679
still works you don't necessarily have

4290.96 --> 4295.84
to go all the way there

4293.679 --> 4298.8
just gotta show within the framework of

4295.84 --> 4301.04
their belief their colloquial insights

4298.8 --> 4303.28
that even in there it mechanically

4301.04 --> 4306.88
doesn't work out

4303.28 --> 4306.88
that's what i like to do a lot

4311.12 --> 4315.76
and hey if the anti-flood earther

4313.199 --> 4317.44
basically pushes your hands because they

4315.76 --> 4318.719
are often aware of

4317.44 --> 4321.199
all that

4318.719 --> 4323.199
they should be

4321.199 --> 4325.839999999999
then yeah if you feel forced to open up

4323.199 --> 4329.839999999999
that can of university study and go all

4325.84 --> 4329.84
the way with official mechanics

4330.0 --> 4334.8
well yeah if you if you can go there if

4332.4 --> 4337.04
you can grasp that then by all means go

4334.8 --> 4337.04
there

4337.12 --> 4340.64
but it's

4338.56 --> 4342.719
going to just be you hammering the

4340.64 --> 4344.4800000000005
anti-flat earthers because the rest of

4342.719 --> 4346.56
the people

4344.48 --> 4348.239
that don't open up that can they're just

4346.56 --> 4349.76
not really going to get it

4348.239 --> 4351.5199999999995
they're just going to be like whoa this

4349.76 --> 4353.12
is some wizard fight between the flat

4351.52 --> 4354.96
earther and the globe

4353.12 --> 4357.12
they don't understand what's happening

4354.96 --> 4358.88
there because they can't grasp it they

4357.12 --> 4361.599999999999
just stick to their colloquial

4358.88 --> 4361.6
understandings

4361.679 --> 4364.679
right

4378.4 --> 4384.799999999999
just ask if we lived inside the sphere

4382.0 --> 4388.88
what in the sphere would that be a

4384.8 --> 4388.88
container oh yeah of course it would

4392.0 --> 4394.239
yep

4394.64 --> 4399.12
there would be

4396.32 --> 4402.48
weird issues though mostly about how did

4399.12 --> 4404.88
the gradient then form right

4402.48 --> 4408.4
a gradient as we know it is very

4404.88 --> 4413.84
unlikely to actually form

4408.4 --> 4413.839999999999
in a design of a concave closed earth

4415.84 --> 4422.0
like how how would the gradient form

4419.52 --> 4423.679
what cold introduction

4422.0 --> 4428.48
atop

4423.679 --> 4430.8
like in the center of the concave sphere

4428.48 --> 4433.28
where how is the cold gonna cause that

4430.8 --> 4436.400000000001
gradient formation of the gas that can't

4433.28 --> 4438.0
work right oh oh and hey there's no

4436.4 --> 4439.5199999999995
curvature

4438.0 --> 4442.08
it's not there

4439.52 --> 4444.0
it was concave you would be able to use

4442.08 --> 4446.5599999999995
powerful telescopes

4444.0 --> 4451.12
in the circum conditions to basically

4446.56 --> 4454.080000000001
look at the other side of the earth

4451.12 --> 4456.719
guess what doesn't happen in reality

4454.08 --> 4456.719
just that

4465.44 --> 4469.44
hey slow mo moon buggy

4467.44 --> 4470.799999999999
what

4469.44 --> 4472.4
the gas pressure

4470.8 --> 4474.320000000001
no it's still in a container because

4472.4 --> 4477.839999999999
he's breathing

4474.32 --> 4480.5599999999995
it's just balancing out with the rest of

4477.84 --> 4483.84
all the gas in the container that we're

4480.56 --> 4483.84
standing in because we're breathing

4487.44 --> 4493.839999999999
and besides if you're gonna put the

4489.679 --> 4496.2390000000005
sulfur hexafluoride into something

4493.84 --> 4498.400000000001
even if it's an open containing like an

4496.239 --> 4500.4
aquarium or something yeah guess what

4498.4 --> 4503.5199999999995
that's still a container it's still a

4500.4 --> 4508.679
container it's contained it's not

4503.52 --> 4508.679
sticking on the outside of a ball

4510.8 --> 4513.8
uh

4524.159 --> 4529.04
over hexafluoride man but that's not

4526.08 --> 4531.12
relevant in the science

4529.04 --> 4533.6
because it's not about the the chemical

4531.12 --> 4535.76
composition of the gas it's about

4533.6 --> 4538.719
the density of the gas and its behavior

4535.76 --> 4539.679
in relation to the irregular

4538.719 --> 4541.52
at

4539.679 --> 4542.96
the irregular gas pressure at ground

4541.52 --> 4546.4800000000005
level

4542.96 --> 4549.199
density differential right so the

4546.48 --> 4551.44
chemical composition is not of sulfur

4549.199 --> 4555.04
hexafluoride is not

4551.44 --> 4555.04
part of the phenomenon

4559.44 --> 4563.44
right

4560.56 --> 4566.88
man-made is only relevant when it is the

4563.44 --> 4568.719
phenomenon in a scientific inquiry

4566.88 --> 4570.4800000000005
when it is the

4568.719 --> 4573.44
phenomenon itself

4570.48 --> 4573.44
then it's a problem

4576.96 --> 4580.88
sulfur flux hexafluoride occurring

4579.199 --> 4583.28
naturally

4580.88 --> 4583.28
okay

4585.84 --> 4590.92
fine it wasn't really relevant to the

4587.92 --> 4590.92
argument

4605.44 --> 4608.44
hmm

4617.52 --> 4622.76
right

4618.48 --> 4622.759999999999
yeah that's a good example

4623.12 --> 4627.719
taking two minute break i'll be right

4624.719 --> 4627.719
back

4731.44 --> 4734.44
hey

4745.6 --> 4752.8
the charts of the elements reveal a lot

4748.8 --> 4752.8
of esoteric knowledge yeah they do

4752.88 --> 4756.2390000000005
i guess

4753.92 --> 4760.52
i don't know which exact chart you're

4756.239 --> 4760.5199999999995
referring to seeking star wars

4766.239 --> 4770.239
you don't happen to me in my chart do

4768.56 --> 4771.1990000000005
you

4770.239 --> 4774.4
for my

4771.199 --> 4774.4
symbolics dot nl

4774.84 --> 4780.8
site it has

4777.6 --> 4780.8
a chart of the elements

4783.28 --> 4788.92
right body

4784.64 --> 4788.92
spirit soul consciousness

4795.28 --> 4800.239
with only one minor globe assuming

4801.28 --> 4806.4
symbolic reference in there it's very

4803.84 --> 4810.159000000001
it's it's kind of skeletal you know

4806.4 --> 4812.5599999999995
technically by now i could just say like

4810.159 --> 4814.0
two three pages of stuff with each

4812.56 --> 4816.4800000000005
element

4814.0 --> 4816.48
but hey

4816.639 --> 4822.84
this was

4819.6 --> 4822.84
from 2008

4823.28 --> 4829.48
last updated

4825.12 --> 4829.48
11th of july 2008.

4836.8 --> 4839.6
and by the way

4841.6 --> 4845.6
it's funny you could it's probably

4843.6 --> 4849.84
itching compatible

4845.6 --> 4854.4800000000005
because iching also uses that

4849.84 --> 4854.4800000000005
like the four elements exactly like that

4855.04 --> 4860.719
like even if you read the iching

4858.56 --> 4862.4800000000005
it's always about which element do you

4860.719 --> 4863.92
combine with which what's going to be

4862.48 --> 4866.879999999999
the

4863.92 --> 4866.88
mechanical

4867.04 --> 4871.12
influence it's

4868.56 --> 4873.120000000001
itching is fascinating it has i haven't

4871.12 --> 4876.159
read any of that in a long time though

4873.12 --> 4878.48
but it's always been like whoa

4876.159 --> 4880.719
there is something really ancient about

4878.48 --> 4880.718999999999
this

4883.12 --> 4886.96
i was referring to the periodic table

4886.0 --> 4889.12
okay

4886.96 --> 4890.8
okay those elements

4889.12 --> 4894.5599999999995
okay

4890.8 --> 4894.56
oh i got distracted

4895.92 --> 4903.719
i guess we were talking about chemistry

4899.679 --> 4903.719
fifth element no

4908.88 --> 4912.2390000000005
no

4910.48 --> 4915.239
it's four elements there's no fifth

4912.239 --> 4915.239
element

4921.28 --> 4924.32
all right if you if you start to go that

4923.28 --> 4925.92
route

4924.32 --> 4929.04
you're breaking the pattern and you're

4925.92 --> 4929.04
gonna end up with

4929.679 --> 4934.159
like an entire

4932.56 --> 4937.04
yeah hundreds

4934.159 --> 4939.12
of elements you can include iron in

4937.04 --> 4942.0
there and wood and yeah oh they look at

4939.12 --> 4943.599999999999
all the traditions out there yeah yeah

4942.0 --> 4944.96
i'm just gonna stick to four you know

4943.6 --> 4947.1990000000005
why

4944.96 --> 4949.76
because

4947.199 --> 4951.44
well because so does the iching

4949.76 --> 4953.04
which is like

4951.44 --> 4954.879999999999
ancient

4953.04 --> 4957.92
the oldest books i know one of the

4954.88 --> 4960.32
oldest ones and because of my discovery

4957.92 --> 4960.32
of the

4960.4 --> 4965.759999999999
the four elements of life

4963.199 --> 4969.04
that also

4965.76 --> 4972.6
connect to that and so i say no there

4969.04 --> 4972.6
are four elements

4975.12 --> 4979.92
because of yeah that fits the best

4983.199 --> 4987.44
that's why they want you to think a

4984.719 --> 4990.2390000000005
pentagram is evil no it's it's about

4987.44 --> 4990.239
something else

4991.28 --> 4994.8
a pentagram is a human

4996.159 --> 5002.799999999999
two legs two arms and a head and a body

5001.28 --> 5003.84
surrounded

5002.8 --> 5006.4800000000005
by

5003.84 --> 5006.4800000000005
a circle

5006.719 --> 5011.199
right

5008.48 --> 5013.199
that it's another approach it's like

5011.199 --> 5016.0
yeah everything is always dragged into

5013.199 --> 5017.839999999999
it four elements in either

5016.0 --> 5019.52
or the spirit

5017.84 --> 5021.76
whatever you know and then you get the

5019.52 --> 5024.0
six-sided star oh there's god with there

5021.76 --> 5025.52
and oh that means that the five-sided

5024.0 --> 5027.52
star excludes god

5025.52 --> 5030.719
blah blah blah blah blah blah but it

5027.52 --> 5032.2390000000005
never stops it never stops

5030.719 --> 5036.4800000000005
right that's why i say if you start

5032.239 --> 5036.48
adding elements never stops

5036.719 --> 5041.12
but yeah

5038.08 --> 5043.5199999999995
the most ancient book i know pretty much

5041.12 --> 5044.8
that i've ever touched upon doesn't do

5043.52 --> 5048.4400000000005
that so

5044.8 --> 5048.4400000000005
i won't either

5060.639 --> 5064.6
why do you do that youtube

5072.0 --> 5075.6
oh by the way thank you that flat fellow

5073.92 --> 5076.96
for the 99 cent

5075.6 --> 5080.280000000001
super chat

5076.96 --> 5080.28
that's nice

5092.639 --> 5095.679
right

5093.6 --> 5096.88
so yeah seeking star again pentagram

5095.679 --> 5099.84
evil

5096.88 --> 5101.84
it's all about the context it's all

5099.84 --> 5105.360000000001
about the context right the pentagram

5101.84 --> 5107.360000000001
can be evil if the one

5105.36 --> 5108.239
that utilizes this

5107.36 --> 5110.239
it

5108.239 --> 5113.44
makes it evil

5110.239 --> 5115.839999999999
for them right an upside down the human

5113.44 --> 5118.96
upside down the head down that reference

5115.84 --> 5118.96
to what is it judas

5119.04 --> 5124.159
upside down like all those reference all

5121.76 --> 5126.639
these esoteric little connections and

5124.159 --> 5127.679
then it's like it's evil it's the upside

5126.639 --> 5129.84
down

5127.679 --> 5131.4400000000005
pentagram right well in that case that

5129.84 --> 5134.400000000001
means that the other way around

5131.44 --> 5136.879999999999
pentagram is actually

5134.4 --> 5136.879999999999
god

5137.04 --> 5143.44
in relation to that

5139.679 --> 5143.4400000000005
isn't that just fascinating right

5147.76 --> 5152.159000000001
right so yeah

5150.639 --> 5155.84
i played around a little with that and

5152.159 --> 5155.839999999999
that's how i came to this

5161.76 --> 5167.280000000001
these

5162.88 --> 5168.639
are two pentagrams counter position

5167.28 --> 5171.12
it

5168.639 --> 5172.96
with an extra circle

5171.12 --> 5176.08
at the middle

5172.96 --> 5177.199
making it fractal

5176.08 --> 5179.5199999999995
right

5177.199 --> 5182.48
and it stands for so many things it's a

5179.52 --> 5184.400000000001
one and a zero this is a ten sided star

5182.48 --> 5186.718999999999
it's a one and a zero

5184.4 --> 5189.04
distinctly ten sides

5186.719 --> 5191.76
one and zero all in nothing

5189.04 --> 5194.159
it's also two five stars which represent

5191.76 --> 5197.280000000001
human you could consider

5194.159 --> 5200.08
pentagrams upside down supposedly not

5197.28 --> 5202.4
upside down as male and female before

5200.08 --> 5205.04
the satan is tuned into a stupid goat

5202.4 --> 5205.04
thing right

5205.12 --> 5212.4
so yeah male female balance with another

5208.8 --> 5212.400000000001
circle within right

5214.08 --> 5220.48
that's that's what i do that's my

5217.679 --> 5223.04
symbol legacy this is the symbol that i

5220.48 --> 5225.839999999999
created and i just shared with you how i

5223.04 --> 5225.84
use it

5231.36 --> 5235.759999999999
oh by the way

5233.199 --> 5238.48
it's also the sun

5235.76 --> 5239.76
which could in certain

5238.48 --> 5244.44
religious

5239.76 --> 5244.4400000000005
pursuits be considered jesus

5260.08 --> 5264.159
and it's funny because when you stare at

5261.92 --> 5265.36
it especially because the circle is

5264.159 --> 5268.239
distinct

5265.36 --> 5270.96
a part of the design in the middle

5268.239 --> 5273.199
it is almost like you are looking at the

5270.96 --> 5273.199
sun

5273.44 --> 5278.48
if you focus because it the sun does

5275.6 --> 5281.84
kind of look like a hole

5278.48 --> 5281.839999999999
when you stare at it

5282.08 --> 5287.92
now it should be perfectly black in

5283.84 --> 5289.84
there but i did the black doesn't stick

5287.92 --> 5291.52
because it's basically just polishing

5289.84 --> 5292.639
dirt really

5291.52 --> 5294.400000000001
that just

5292.639 --> 5298.52
stayed in there for

5294.4 --> 5298.5199999999995
over a decade no problem

5312.48 --> 5315.879999999999
what's this

5345.76 --> 5348.76
what

5350.719 --> 5358.84
definitely knows about to contain blah

5355.36 --> 5358.839999999999
no they don't

5364.08 --> 5368.159
you don't even know if that's permanent

5370.32 --> 5377.0
whatever they did there might have

5371.92 --> 5377.0
simply been the condition of the time

5382.159 --> 5386.48
okay wire symbols from the past

5390.32 --> 5393.32
right

5396.08 --> 5398.32
hey

5399.76 --> 5403.360000000001
is there a 10 star in there what the

5401.76 --> 5407.2390000000005
hell

5403.36 --> 5407.239
they call that a decagram

5407.52 --> 5412.400000000001
i've never

5409.04 --> 5412.4
ever seen that before

5413.04 --> 5417.76
like i've never seen anybody do that

5415.52 --> 5420.84
before what does it say i can't zoom in

5417.76 --> 5420.84
on there

5423.04 --> 5428.719
can i say yeah i have to be part of

5425.36 --> 5428.719
pinterest in order to

5429.199 --> 5432.08
to download it

5433.28 --> 5436.08
oh maybe this

5439.04 --> 5447.08
oh wait maybe i can

5442.48 --> 5447.08
what the hell piss off

5456.239 --> 5460.32
i'd i'd like to zoom in on it but i

5458.239 --> 5463.759999999999
can't see it seeking star wars if you

5460.32 --> 5466.08
could maybe email it to me

5463.76 --> 5467.280000000001
like the image itself

5466.08 --> 5469.199
literally

5467.28 --> 5472.759999999999
so that i could directly download it or

5469.199 --> 5472.759999999999
pdf yeah

5476.56 --> 5480.88
so yeah i'm not familiar with this

5478.48 --> 5484.638999999999
decagram and there was some scribbling

5480.88 --> 5486.96
in there i have no idea what that is

5484.639 --> 5488.88
and i'll just let you know

5486.96 --> 5490.4
i have never

5488.88 --> 5494.32
seen it

5490.4 --> 5494.32
before this very moment ever

5494.8 --> 5501.04
oh and by the way this decagram doesn't

5497.679 --> 5501.04
have a circle in the middle

5501.36 --> 5509.239
that's a very important key factor

5505.76 --> 5509.2390000000005
in my design

5545.6 --> 5548.320000000001
okay

5550.639 --> 5554.32
i don't even get what that means

5558.0 --> 5562.96
use divination oh my god we can't use

5560.8 --> 5565.84
divination really so what type of

5562.96 --> 5567.84
divination is that is that like

5565.84 --> 5569.6
divination where you have to freaking

5567.84 --> 5572.159000000001
sacrifice something with that and all

5569.6 --> 5572.159000000001
that [ __ ]

5572.48 --> 5577.5199999999995
i mean

5575.36 --> 5580.08
how do you not

5577.52 --> 5580.080000000001
divine

5580.4 --> 5584.239
you don't have to do anything to divine

5583.199 --> 5586.799999999999
something

5584.239 --> 5590.5599999999995
you just focus

5586.8 --> 5590.56
at least i do right

5593.36 --> 5598.639
it's not like oh i have to have my

5595.52 --> 5601.76
divining cards or my bones

5598.639 --> 5604.96
or quick get me some tea leaves no no i

5601.76 --> 5604.96
just click

5605.12 --> 5609.199
so i can't do that can i

5614.239 --> 5618.48
pass through the fire what does that

5615.92 --> 5618.4800000000005
even mean

5624.32 --> 5632.5599999999995
an observer of times what

5629.04 --> 5635.199
what i don't get it

5632.56 --> 5639.1990000000005
what's an observer of times

5635.199 --> 5639.199
that's a really weird thing to say

5639.6 --> 5646.4800000000005
enchanter or a witch well yeah it kind

5643.28 --> 5646.48
of depends you know

5650.08 --> 5658.28
it's this is all just

5653.28 --> 5658.28
it's not coming out of jesus's mouth

5680.719 --> 5686.119
a watchman is an observer of time this

5691.119 --> 5693.44
okay

5693.84 --> 5698.360000000001
don't know what that's supposed to mean

6005.44 --> 6011.5199999999995
to get an account here you must

6008.56 --> 6014.56
have a smartphone so you could do the

6011.52 --> 6017.040000000001
[ __ ] little scan code crap

6014.56 --> 6020.2390000000005
well [ __ ] you then

6017.04 --> 6022.639
freaking mobile zombie

6020.239 --> 6023.5199999999995
zone

6022.639 --> 6025.76
i

6023.52 --> 6025.76
like

6027.119 --> 6031.5199999999995
like they threatened to do that same

6029.04 --> 6036.119
[ __ ] like with banking here right but

6031.52 --> 6036.119000000001
there wasn't always another alternative

6036.32 --> 6040.96
i think that

6037.92 --> 6043.28
having everything like programs

6040.96 --> 6045.2390000000005
everything you do become

6043.28 --> 6047.5199999999995
mobile device

6045.239 --> 6049.119
specifically dependent for it to

6047.52 --> 6050.8
function

6049.119 --> 6052.0
i think that

6050.8 --> 6053.28
is the

6052.0 --> 6054.08
true

6053.28 --> 6057.04
and

6054.08 --> 6059.84
permanent mark of the beast

6057.04 --> 6062.159
once everything is standardized that you

6059.84 --> 6064.400000000001
must have a mobile or literally nothing

6062.159 --> 6066.719
functions or you have to like make a

6064.4 --> 6068.4
device to kind of be able to simulate a

6066.719 --> 6070.4
mobile phone

6068.4 --> 6073.04
once that's there

6070.4 --> 6075.599999999999
it's over

6073.04 --> 6078.88
it's over

6075.6 --> 6080.08
freaking smartphones in my opinion are

6078.88 --> 6082.08
the true

6080.08 --> 6084.5599999999995
mark of the beast and it's been here for

6082.08 --> 6084.5599999999995
a while

6085.04 --> 6087.84
never got one

6091.36 --> 6097.5199999999995
and i resent any

6093.679 --> 6100.32
any sort of program online free i don't

6097.52 --> 6101.119000000001
care if you're [ __ ] free if you

6100.32 --> 6102.48
make

6101.119 --> 6105.759999999999
people

6102.48 --> 6108.718999999999
require a [ __ ] mobile phone in order

6105.76 --> 6111.280000000001
for them to even be there

6108.719 --> 6114.88
in my opinion you should be

6111.28 --> 6114.88
like penalized for that

6115.119 --> 6118.96
if i was in government i'd literally

6117.04 --> 6120.8
give you fines like yeah you're not

6118.96 --> 6122.8
allowed to do that now unfortunately

6120.8 --> 6126.08
government kind of likes it no because

6122.8 --> 6128.88
they're communist scumbags that want the

6126.08 --> 6128.88
end of the world

6129.44 --> 6136.32
they like it they like that mark it's so

6132.639 --> 6140.719
easy all you have to do is just have a

6136.32 --> 6142.48
[ __ ] mobile phone with you forever

6140.719 --> 6144.719
tracking what you do recording

6142.48 --> 6147.36
everything you say everything you do

6144.719 --> 6149.76
forever nothing you could do to stop it

6147.36 --> 6152.48
yeah i don't like those

6149.76 --> 6154.639
i never want one ever

6152.48 --> 6157.839999999999
and every time i bump into

6154.639 --> 6160.0
you can't to use this program you must

6157.84 --> 6162.4800000000005
have a mobile

6160.0 --> 6168.56
i get really angry

6162.48 --> 6168.5599999999995
i hate that i savagely hate that

6169.28 --> 6173.199
it's a sign of poor

6173.52 --> 6179.52
poor oversight and evil

6176.48 --> 6181.759999999999
if your program requires you

6179.52 --> 6183.1990000000005
to have a [ __ ] mobile or it won't

6181.76 --> 6185.119000000001
function

6183.199 --> 6186.5599999999995
right a specific

6185.119 --> 6188.5599999999995
smartphone

6186.56 --> 6191.6
where you have to scan

6188.56 --> 6193.1990000000005
you have to use your camera have to be

6191.6 --> 6194.639
able to

6193.199 --> 6195.759999999999
use apps

6194.639 --> 6198.88
yeah

6195.76 --> 6200.8
what you do in your program requires you

6198.88 --> 6203.119
to have all that

6200.8 --> 6205.84
i boycott you

6203.119 --> 6207.04
officially i boycott you

6205.84 --> 6211.679
program

6207.04 --> 6214.88
programmers owner company if you make

6211.679 --> 6219.04
your users do that

6214.88 --> 6222.0
they have to have that i boycott you

6219.04 --> 6224.88
in my personal opinion every program

6222.0 --> 6227.44
everything that's for the public

6224.88 --> 6230.639
must have an alternative option to

6227.44 --> 6230.638999999999
having a smartphone

6230.84 --> 6234.88
must they must

6240.719 --> 6244.4
i mean oh qr code

6243.119 --> 6245.5199999999995
oh okay

6244.4 --> 6248.159
well

6245.52 --> 6251.1990000000005
then make a system

6248.159 --> 6253.92
a device a universal device

6251.199 --> 6256.0
it could be very cheap that isn't a

6253.92 --> 6260.2390000000005
[ __ ] smartphone

6256.0 --> 6262.0
that can just quickly do that

6260.239 --> 6264.239
make it readily available everywhere

6262.0 --> 6266.48
it's like yeah you have to use this qr

6264.239 --> 6268.08
code these days so here is a

6266.48 --> 6269.44
non-smartphone

6268.08 --> 6270.679
non

6269.44 --> 6275.839999999999
non

6270.679 --> 6275.84
communication device that can do that

6287.199 --> 6292.239
yeah the thing that people have super

6288.96 --> 6296.0
glued to their faces yeah i hate them

6292.239 --> 6298.48
and i've been hating them for 20 years

6296.0 --> 6302.159
everything about them sucks the way they

6298.48 --> 6304.0
feel when you touch the screen it sucks

6302.159 --> 6307.119
it literally feels like it's

6304.0 --> 6308.48
magnetically draining energy from me

6307.119 --> 6311.199
i hate

6308.48 --> 6313.36
those [ __ ] little satan squares i

6311.199 --> 6315.5199999999995
hate them

6313.36 --> 6317.44
oh they're so confused oh look we got

6315.52 --> 6320.0
all the

6317.44 --> 6322.08
mobile streaming oh

6320.0 --> 6324.88
everybody's doing it yeah i'm not

6322.08 --> 6328.199
[ __ ] doing it you got it i'm not

6324.88 --> 6328.1990000000005
doing that

6340.48 --> 6344.159
but what i am doing is rounding out the

6342.4 --> 6346.239
show

6344.159 --> 6348.08
i think a lot of people have already

6346.239 --> 6350.4
kind of gone

6348.08 --> 6352.0
they don't want to hear about how their

6350.4 --> 6355.28
freaking

6352.0 --> 6357.36
smartphone is evil because i bet every

6355.28 --> 6359.679
single one of you in the chat right now

6357.36 --> 6362.32
is watching this show through a freaking

6359.679 --> 6364.88
smartphone aren't you

6362.32 --> 6368.96
you're all doing it all of you i'm never

6364.88 --> 6368.96
gonna do it hear me never

6369.92 --> 6375.679
and i will try to politically defend the

6374.8 --> 6376.400000000001
right

6375.679 --> 6378.159
to

6376.4 --> 6379.759999999999
be able to

6378.159 --> 6382.719
live properly

6379.76 --> 6385.280000000001
and use programs without a smartphone i

6382.719 --> 6387.679
will literally spend the rest of my life

6385.28 --> 6390.239
fighting for that right

6387.679 --> 6392.159
that forces people that make public

6390.239 --> 6395.599999999999
programs

6392.159 --> 6399.36
to give an option where people will not

6395.6 --> 6401.84
be [ __ ] forced to use a smartphone

6399.36 --> 6401.839999999999
you got it

6452.48 --> 6456.879999999999
so oh no

6454.159 --> 6458.239
i'm pretty sure it's listening to me at

6456.88 --> 6459.84
all times

6458.239 --> 6461.919999999999
and yeah

6459.84 --> 6464.2390000000005
like every other device

6461.92 --> 6467.04
every other electronic device after 2010

6464.239 --> 6467.04
pretty much yeah

6467.44 --> 6470.799999999999
right i'm not

6468.84 --> 6474.32
really

6470.8 --> 6477.1990000000005
in the delusion that i can actually get

6474.32 --> 6479.679
perfect privacy ever again

6477.199 --> 6480.879999999999
it's not gonna happen

6479.679 --> 6482.159
but

6480.88 --> 6485.76
i will

6482.159 --> 6488.159
not be forced to interface with a

6485.76 --> 6492.56
[ __ ] touchscreen

6488.159 --> 6496.879999999999
crappy too high resolution micro screen

6492.56 --> 6498.8
in order to get things done i will never

6496.88 --> 6501.04
do that

6498.8 --> 6503.84
i really want i've been holding on to

6501.04 --> 6506.08
that for a very long time

6503.84 --> 6511.2390000000005
and i will keep doing that and i will

6506.08 --> 6511.239
get political about it if necessary

6513.44 --> 6520.719
ah i see you agree with me on that aries

6518.32 --> 6523.28
yeah how many people talk oh the work of

6520.719 --> 6524.4800000000005
the beast is this is this oh or it's the

6523.28 --> 6526.32
next thing

6524.48 --> 6528.4
it's just the next thing oh look

6526.32 --> 6530.4
something even more atrocious looking oh

6528.4 --> 6532.5599999999995
that must be the marketing oh what if it

6530.4 --> 6534.5599999999995
was already there

6532.56 --> 6536.320000000001
what if what what if it's already there

6534.56 --> 6538.56
for like two decades and like

6536.32 --> 6540.08
everybody's getting used to it

6538.56 --> 6542.400000000001
what do you think that the mark of the

6540.08 --> 6545.92
beast when it comes out it's going to be

6542.4 --> 6545.92
called the mark of the beast

6546.0 --> 6548.159
no

6548.56 --> 6551.1990000000005
no it won't

6551.28 --> 6557.599
it will function like it though

6555.28 --> 6557.599
huh

6562.0 --> 6564.719
wow

6562.88 --> 6566.56
keep throwing nickels at me that flat

6564.719 --> 6569.84
fellow

6566.56 --> 6569.84
thank you for that

6576.88 --> 6580.32
start suing them inside

6580.84 --> 6585.599
yes like the episode in south park

6586.48 --> 6591.919999999999
uh i don't even want to go there

6589.28 --> 6591.92
but yes

6592.4 --> 6597.28
but hey they'll go as far as like oh we

6594.88 --> 6599.92
can now have your smartphone

6597.28 --> 6603.84
directly interfacing with your card

6599.92 --> 6606.4800000000005
visual cortex so you can literally have

6603.84 --> 6609.159000000001
like mobile

6606.48 --> 6612.159
text or like a micro sc screen like

6609.159 --> 6614.0
holographically projected inside of your

6612.159 --> 6616.48
mind

6614.0 --> 6617.52
and then it'll just be this tiny chip

6616.48 --> 6618.959999999999
with

6617.52 --> 6621.119000000001
wi-fi

6618.96 --> 6622.4800000000005
and then you can do it like that yeah i

6621.119 --> 6625.5199999999995
have no doubt

6622.48 --> 6627.678999999999
that it's already being developed

6625.52 --> 6629.84
and it would look pretty cool

6627.679 --> 6632.159
you know

6629.84 --> 6634.4800000000005
yeah i don't want it though
