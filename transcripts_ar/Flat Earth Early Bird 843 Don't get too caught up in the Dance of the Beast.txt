90.32 --> 95.6
i don't think it's really rain so far

92.479 --> 95.6
but it's just this

97.2 --> 102.96000000000001
cloud situation up there

104.56 --> 109.28
it's not really cold though it is kind

106.799 --> 109.28
of moist

[Music]

thursday the 25th of march 2021

138.72 --> 144.8
amanda young hello first in chat

142.64 --> 147.2
uh it's gray and foggy over there too

144.8 --> 147.20000000000002
all right

147.84 --> 155.68
huh yeah i don't know what that is but

152.239 --> 159.44
anyway hey tom parker

155.68 --> 159.44
brandm good to see you

161.12 --> 173.20000000000002
so got green tea

170.4 --> 173.519
i went to bed early again yesterday and

173.2 --> 176.0
it

173.519 --> 177.76
was doing it's been doing some good also

176.0 --> 179.68
didn't have the second coffee

177.76 --> 182.239
and my shoulder does actually feel a

179.68 --> 182.239
little better

182.72 --> 191.2
and so i'm just gonna keep that up

187.28 --> 193.519
i think that it'll be back to normal no

191.2 --> 193.51899999999998
time

196.84 --> 199.84
uh

211.44 --> 217.84
so yeah yesterday

214.56 --> 221.04
what's early for me uh early is like

217.84 --> 227.84
a half past 12.

221.04 --> 227.84
that's early for me

230.319 --> 233.67999999999998
but yeah i just i feel like i need that

233.04 --> 241.84
sleep

233.68 --> 241.84
to basically restore my physique

253.28 --> 257.12
right but yes they've been busy

258.88 --> 265.28
uh flat earth debate i don't think i was

261.919 --> 267.84
very super active inserted some things

265.28 --> 282.0
in the beginning

267.84 --> 285.19899999999996
mostly hang in the background

282.0 --> 288.479
yeah mandy young yeah that this one

285.199 --> 291.28000000000003
it's this one guy it's one guy

288.479 --> 292.24
and he's just very triggered these days

291.28 --> 294.479
and he thinks

292.24 --> 295.68
like i'm apparently a very good target

294.479 --> 298.479
to

295.68 --> 300.8
to harass with that [ __ ] this personal

298.479 --> 300.8
[ __ ]

301.12 --> 304.0
but i don't care

307.68 --> 313.12
you know in a way people like that

309.84 --> 313.11999999999995
should be very triggered

316.0 --> 322.0
because their lives are the most screwed

318.56 --> 322.0
up of everyone so

325.52 --> 339.84
in the end i really only pity them

347.68 --> 352.32
so there was yeah plenty of stuff on the

350.96 --> 355.28
internet yesterday

352.32 --> 355.759
watch some info wars it's a lot about

355.28 --> 360.96
the

355.759 --> 360.96000000000004
bowler shooting and all that and

361.44 --> 366.08
it's a really weird combination of

364.88 --> 369.52
evidence so far

366.08 --> 371.52
and well it seems to be moving away

369.52 --> 373.19899999999996
from that inattention and just becoming

371.52 --> 376.15999999999997
all political and

373.199 --> 378.56
like ooh it's like it almost seems like

376.16 --> 381.44
a giant straw man like oh

378.56 --> 382.16
the shooter is white oh it's all white

381.44 --> 384.24
that [ __ ]

382.16 --> 385.52000000000004
and now of course it's not it's just

384.24 --> 388.72
ridiculous it's

385.52 --> 395.44
but at the same time

388.72 --> 398.08000000000004
like the combination of footage

395.44 --> 399.28
yeah like i would have to admit that

398.08 --> 402.31899999999996
even though it could

399.28 --> 405.52
have been real i have not seen anything

402.319 --> 409.84000000000003
super specific to tell me

405.52 --> 409.84
that it is absolutely real

413.759 --> 417.44
so yeah whatever happened

418.479 --> 422.639
i'm i'm pretty sure that the guy though

421.12 --> 426.639
was like

422.639 --> 429.84000000000003
going nuts the guy that's

426.639 --> 429.84000000000003
supposedly done that

429.919 --> 434.24
so whether he was kind of like being set

432.319 --> 437.28000000000003
up or whether he really did that

434.24 --> 438.639
i don't know but something certainly did

437.28 --> 442.63899999999995
go down there

438.639 --> 444.479
it's not just a complete fake out act

442.639 --> 446.0
but yeah i don't have much more

444.479 --> 451.84
information

446.0 --> 451.84
but that just kind of standing out to me

453.84 --> 455.84999999999997
all right hey james mason good to see

455.599 --> 457.36
you

455.85 --> 460.8
[Music]

457.36 --> 465.12
right at the same time

460.8 --> 467.759
tea time with gary terry own benjamin

465.12 --> 467.759
good stuff

471.52 --> 476.84
like big bear seems very much in the

473.919 --> 481.44
flow and staying in the flow

476.84 --> 481.44
and yeah i'm glad he is

484.96 --> 493.84
hello foul on buchanan good to see you

504.84 --> 509.67999999999995
uh

506.08 --> 509.68
right yeah and also

510.24 --> 515.12
the sun is coming through thinner part

513.599 --> 519.9190000000001
of the clouds

515.12 --> 521.919
oh but here comes a big grape part again

519.919 --> 524.3199999999999
wow the clouds up there do seem to be

521.919 --> 526.88
rushing a lot

524.32 --> 526.88
it's weird

529.519 --> 533.44
but yeah brandon toys i do kind of keep

531.6 --> 535.36
track of it now

533.44 --> 537.6800000000001
like it's a pretty interesting hand

535.36 --> 537.6800000000001
group

539.12 --> 545.279
and ballers do seem to be

542.399 --> 545.279
coming in there

545.519 --> 551.2
so that's yeah it's just it's it's

549.04 --> 552.3199999999999
in a way it is kind of a mess but in

551.2 --> 555.9200000000001
other ways like

552.32 --> 559.839
yeah it's still somewhat interesting

555.92 --> 559.8389999999999
and i seem to be welcome there

560.88 --> 569.279
like even on the panel so that's nice

565.2 --> 569.279
and ranty got in there too yesterday

570.72 --> 575.0400000000001
so yeah even in there i kind of didn't

572.72 --> 578.0
really speak up much

575.04 --> 578.0
eventually drop

581.04 --> 584.64
but it's kind of nice to have like a new

582.8 --> 588.16
group

584.64 --> 588.16
let's see what's going on in there

588.48 --> 591.839
hello m

607.44 --> 612.1600000000001
where's my pencil oh there it is right

615.04 --> 621.92
i'm gonna try to make more notes today

618.959 --> 621.92
more details

627.279 --> 632.64
right oh yeah the title

630.64 --> 634.959
today's show title yeah i did come up

632.64 --> 639.76
with that

634.959 --> 640.399
it like in the evening i do spend a lot

639.76 --> 643.8389999999999
of time

640.399 --> 647.76
while looking at media

643.839 --> 650.0790000000001
like in for wars and big bear

647.76 --> 651.6
i do something that i kind of i don't

650.079 --> 653.8389999999999
know

651.6 --> 655.519
how to describe what that process is but

653.839 --> 656.72
you could call it kind of like dream

655.519 --> 659.839
walking

656.72 --> 661.279
just walking around a lot thinking and

659.839 --> 664.72
letting those thoughts go

661.279 --> 667.519
pretty deep and far

664.72 --> 669.519
so yeah dreamwalking and this name came

667.519 --> 671.6
to me

669.519 --> 673.2
like hey that's that's a good saying

671.6 --> 675.279
that's

673.2 --> 677.0400000000001
something i'm gonna title my show so i

675.279 --> 679.12
did

677.04 --> 681.5999999999999
don't get too caught up in the dance of

679.12 --> 681.6
the beast

682.24 --> 685.76
and i was wondering what you guys in

684.72 --> 687.839
chat thinks

685.76 --> 689.8389999999999
that means before i just outright

687.839 --> 691.519
explain it

689.839 --> 693.839
if everything's all right you should be

691.519 --> 697.76
able to just outright get it

693.839 --> 697.7600000000001
even on a on a fractal level

697.92 --> 701.76
but i'm curious to see what your got

700.399 --> 705.839
what you guys

701.76 --> 717.8389999999999
interpreted as can you

705.839 --> 717.839
describe it what this title means

722.16 --> 731.8389999999999
i'll take my time

754.959 --> 773.8389999999999
anyone amanda young tom parker

758.32 --> 773.839
james mason vowlan buchanan m

780.16 --> 786.3199999999999
is it still going yeah it's still going

785.92 --> 788.8
huh

786.32 --> 791.12
internet couldn't disconnect it i was

788.8 --> 794.24
just there in time

791.12 --> 797.04
i mean i was there just in time

794.24 --> 798.9590000000001
didn't catch that right the title the

797.04 --> 801.04
title the title of the show don't get

798.959 --> 803.92
too caught up in the dance of the beast

801.04 --> 803.92
what does it mean

804.72 --> 815.839
that was my question in the last five

807.36 --> 815.839
minutes now

834.16 --> 843.8389999999999
media okay

868.72 --> 874.399
okay well you have our lumber cannon

870.88 --> 874.399
that certainly does apply

875.04 --> 882.079
the world is the domain of the beast

878.24 --> 885.36
the devil but what is the dance of the

882.079 --> 888.079
beast specifically

885.36 --> 888.639
and why is it important not to get

888.079 --> 893.04
caught

888.639 --> 895.839
up in it right so that specifies

893.04 --> 895.8389999999999
engagement

897.279 --> 901.92
what is the dance of the beast

898.959 --> 913.8389999999999
specifically in this context

901.92 --> 913.8389999999999
can you guys guess

922.0 --> 927.839
i just remembered another aspect of it

925.519 --> 930.9590000000001
that i didn't make a note of but i

927.839 --> 930.9590000000001
remember it that's good

931.279 --> 940.32
right so the dance of the beast is

935.279 --> 943.279
the program it's the machine

940.32 --> 944.399
and the machine basically gives you

943.279 --> 948.16
opportunities

944.399 --> 951.44
to dance with it

948.16 --> 954.8
to play the game to dance the dance

951.44 --> 957.839
of the beast the machine the beast

954.8 --> 960.639
right so that you become part of it

957.839 --> 960.639
and dance with it

962.079 --> 965.7589999999999
and there's at this point the beast is

965.36 --> 969.04
so

965.759 --> 970.48
entangled with everything it's almost

969.04 --> 974.24
impossible

970.48 --> 976.8000000000001
not to in some way dance with the beast

974.24 --> 978.24
especially if you're going to engage in

976.8 --> 980.8
media

978.24 --> 984.5600000000001
indeed so that that word media was

980.8 --> 984.56
definitely a good one james mason

985.68 --> 989.68
does have an influence because if you

987.68 --> 991.5999999999999
engage in media it's very likely you're

989.68 --> 992.3199999999999
gonna get tangled up in the dance of the

991.6 --> 994.32
beast

992.32 --> 996.8000000000001
one way or the other because the thing

994.32 --> 1001.0400000000001
is even if you think

996.8 --> 1001.04
that you're dancing against the beast

1001.92 --> 1005.759
you might not realize that you're still

1003.839 --> 1008.839
dancing with the beast

1005.759 --> 1010.48
you're just playing another part of the

1008.839 --> 1013.9200000000001
dance

1010.48 --> 1016.0790000000001
right because it's there

1013.92 --> 1017.4399999999999
it's there to tap into it seems a

1016.079 --> 1020.2399999999999
logical thing to do

1017.44 --> 1022.0
and a group formation and polarization

1020.24 --> 1026.4
and everything

1022.0 --> 1026.4
it's like a game like a dance

1029.039 --> 1034.16
and when you engage you also

1036.24 --> 1043.76
take steps back with giving attention

1040.959 --> 1046.319
to yourself as an individual and like

1043.76 --> 1049.6
engage in this group

1046.319 --> 1049.6
frame mechanic

1050.24 --> 1053.52
and a lot of those are part are

1052.64 --> 1057.039
integrated

1053.52 --> 1057.039
into the dance of the beast

1057.44 --> 1067.679
video quality has dropped that must be

1059.2 --> 1070.0800000000002
on your end tom parker

1067.679 --> 1070.96
right so a lot of people out there one

1070.08 --> 1074.0
way or the other

1070.96 --> 1076.4
are dancing with the beast

1074.0 --> 1077.919
in order to achieve what they're trying

1076.4 --> 1079.6000000000001
to achieve

1077.919 --> 1081.2800000000002
but as they do it they dance with the

1079.6 --> 1084.48
beast

1081.28 --> 1085.6
and the more and the longer and the

1084.48 --> 1088.08
stronger you dance

1085.6 --> 1089.4399999999998
the more you get caught up in the game

1088.08 --> 1095.28
of it

1089.44 --> 1098.0800000000002
like a chair dance kind of thing

1095.28 --> 1100.32
right so for bigger media people out

1098.08 --> 1102.8799999999999
there

1100.32 --> 1103.6789999999999
their little media empire for example or

1102.88 --> 1106.16
just like

1103.679 --> 1108.3200000000002
like specialized news anchors of some

1106.16 --> 1112.799
kind that are getting fame and all that

1108.32 --> 1112.799
yeah they are too dancing with the beast

1115.039 --> 1120.24
and the more you get forward onto the

1117.6 --> 1123.84
attention span

1120.24 --> 1125.679
within the entire thing yeah you also

1123.84 --> 1128.08
risk more

1125.679 --> 1129.919
tension grows higher you could just lose

1128.08 --> 1133.6
the chair you could just drop

1129.919 --> 1136.24
off when you get pushed to the front

1133.6 --> 1139.4399999999998
line as it were in the attention of the

1136.24 --> 1139.44
entire dance of the beast

1141.679 --> 1151.2800000000002
right also from this perspective on from

1146.48 --> 1154.24
a framework that has been designed

1151.28 --> 1154.559
for people to be able to engage with and

1154.24 --> 1158.0
by

1154.559 --> 1161.36
engaging feeding it dancing with the

1158.0 --> 1161.36
beast feeds the bees too

1161.44 --> 1168.799
it enervates it keeps it going

1164.72 --> 1170.08
maybe the idea every time i talk about

1168.799 --> 1173.12
controllers or

1170.08 --> 1173.84
the new world order people that are

1173.12 --> 1176.4799999999998
actually

1173.84 --> 1177.28
feeding it you know it's very difficult

1176.48 --> 1179.44
because

1177.28 --> 1181.36
the designers don't necessarily have to

1179.44 --> 1182.96
be the ones feeding the beast

1181.36 --> 1185.1999999999998
they just basically designed the

1182.96 --> 1188.4
contraption

1185.2 --> 1192.0
they designed the game maybe

1188.4 --> 1194.0
partially or maybe

1192.0 --> 1195.76
fully but that doesn't mean that they're

1194.0 --> 1198.16
actually engaging with it

1195.76 --> 1198.16
at all

1199.039 --> 1205.679
doesn't exclude it either so maybe

1202.08 --> 1206.8799999999999
instead of calling it controllers may be

1205.679 --> 1210.88
calling it

1206.88 --> 1215.0390000000002
control maybe it is the spirit

1210.88 --> 1220.96
of control control obsession

1215.039 --> 1223.28
that possesses people

1220.96 --> 1223.28
right

1224.159 --> 1231.5200000000002
like people could step up take over the

1228.88 --> 1233.0390000000002
control function and basically become

1231.52 --> 1235.679
that

1233.039 --> 1238.4
the front runner for controller

1235.679 --> 1238.4
influence

1241.76 --> 1245.919
so maybe control is a spirit

1246.4 --> 1251.44
that can possess if you let it

1251.76 --> 1255.84
maybe can also be considered dancing

1253.919 --> 1259.919
with the beast

1255.84 --> 1259.9189999999999
trying to delegate the dance

1260.84 --> 1265.76
control

1263.76 --> 1267.44
so anyway yeah i've been thinking like

1265.76 --> 1270.4
that

1267.44 --> 1270.4
kind of esoteric

1271.28 --> 1277.84
i was just wondering what you guys

1272.799 --> 1277.84
thought of that

1284.48 --> 1293.919
hey mark collard seeking star water

1289.2 --> 1293.919
chris la jambe good to see you

1302.84 --> 1305.84
giado

1321.039 --> 1325.12
that's right so just gonna make these

1324.08 --> 1327.84
notes to

1325.12 --> 1333.84
anchor it in this moment can reference

1327.84 --> 1333.84
back to it

1351.76 --> 1356.72
all right almost forgot i should make a

1354.0 --> 1358.72
note i watched quantum of conscious

1356.72 --> 1360.0
like i've been subscribed to him for a

1358.72 --> 1363.1200000000001
long time now

1360.0 --> 1366.72
i think i think it's a long time

1363.12 --> 1367.28
and he has a very typical style of doing

1366.72 --> 1370.559
his

1367.28 --> 1372.96
shows in one pre-record in the recorded

1370.559 --> 1372.96
session

1373.44 --> 1378.96
he's making a lot of good points too

1377.039 --> 1380.4
like i get the feeling that the things

1378.96 --> 1382.96
that i try to do

1380.4 --> 1384.0800000000002
with the esoterics and just metaphors

1382.96 --> 1386.08
and trying to

1384.08 --> 1387.6789999999999
lay out the structure like he's he's

1386.08 --> 1390.559
good at that too

1387.679 --> 1390.5590000000002
in his own way

1393.36 --> 1397.6789999999999
and yeah his last stream definitely

1398.559 --> 1403.84
emphasized that to me

1405.28 --> 1410.559
although he does bring in like almost

1407.799 --> 1412.96
solapsistic

1410.559 --> 1414.32
points of view to that level sometimes

1412.96 --> 1418.08
he does that

1414.32 --> 1419.84
i tend to not do that as much

1418.08 --> 1431.84
but it's still yeah it was pretty good

1419.84 --> 1431.84
yesterday's quantum of conscious video

1438.559 --> 1444.32
right so yeah don't get too caught up in

1440.72 --> 1448.159
the dance of the beast

1444.32 --> 1451.12
it's gonna take from you as you go

1448.159 --> 1453.1200000000001
might get you a whole lot of things too

1451.12 --> 1456.559
but it is gonna take things from you

1453.12 --> 1458.8799999999999
and if you stay in too long

1456.559 --> 1460.1589999999999
yeah you're gonna crumble and get

1458.88 --> 1462.0
trampled on

1460.159 --> 1473.8400000000001
they're just gonna keep on dancing right

1462.0 --> 1473.84
over you

1477.919 --> 1484.3200000000002
all right also realization the

1480.88 --> 1484.3200000000002
controllers may not be

1484.84 --> 1490.3999999999999
individuals it may simply be

1487.36 --> 1493.6789999999999
a spirit a spirit of control that can

1490.4 --> 1496.0800000000002
possess people and that control spirit

1493.679 --> 1498.0
is just part of the dance of the beast

1496.08 --> 1501.84
too

1498.0 --> 1501.84
it's the control interface

1503.44 --> 1507.919
for whoever is ready to go there because

1505.6 --> 1512.3999999999999
i think that the beast has like

1507.919 --> 1515.2
technically unlimited engagement range

1512.4 --> 1516.0
into the darkness and maybe into the

1515.2 --> 1519.1200000000001
light

1516.0 --> 1521.6
but definitely into the darkness

1519.12 --> 1524.9599999999998
whoever's bold enough to take it there

1521.6 --> 1524.9599999999998
it it has a

1525.679 --> 1532.4
a place in the dance for it

1529.279 --> 1535.679
and people engaging changes

1532.4 --> 1535.679
the dance too like that

1539.52 --> 1544.1589999999999
don't invite the beast up for a dance

1541.52 --> 1544.1589999999999
regardless

1546.4 --> 1551.2
well you can stand on the sidelines and

1548.72 --> 1553.52
watch it

1551.2 --> 1554.799
but at some point people are going to

1553.52 --> 1557.84
engage

1554.799 --> 1557.84
you know

1559.52 --> 1565.12
because it it does affect everything

1562.64 --> 1566.0
the dance of the beast it does influence

1565.12 --> 1569.4399999999998
the way things

1566.0 --> 1571.279
happen and the the general atmosphere

1569.44 --> 1572.96
because a lot of people that are not

1571.279 --> 1574.88
very conscious

1572.96 --> 1576.96
they're born into this dance of the

1574.88 --> 1585.8400000000001
beast

1576.96 --> 1588.96
they think that that's the normal thing

1585.84 --> 1592.8799999999999
right the autopilot way autopilot

1588.96 --> 1596.0
actions is typically

1592.88 --> 1599.279
going to lead to feeding into the dance

1596.0 --> 1601.2
of the beast

1599.279 --> 1602.64
because of the railroad system the

1601.2 --> 1606.4
comfort of

1602.64 --> 1609.44
just doing very

1606.4 --> 1613.039
specific frequency things

1609.44 --> 1615.44
almost like a safe space within

1613.039 --> 1616.24
the mechanism of the dance of the beast

1615.44 --> 1619.3600000000001
this is

1616.24 --> 1620.559
a railroad an autopilot thing and

1619.36 --> 1627.84
there's

1620.559 --> 1627.84
yeah there's feeds into it on all levels

1634.0 --> 1638.08
all right don't invite the beast up for

1635.76 --> 1642.24
a dance

1638.08 --> 1642.24
well people don't typically do that

1642.399 --> 1647.4399999999998
no but some people may have like

1645.279 --> 1650.08
attention needs they want to

1647.44 --> 1651.8400000000001
stand out with something and then they

1650.08 --> 1655.84
will invite the beast

1651.84 --> 1658.8799999999999
you can do that in ways

1655.84 --> 1661.6789999999999
by playing into the games you just touch

1658.88 --> 1664.24
like certain groups are engaging in

1661.679 --> 1666.96
certain type of games

1664.24 --> 1669.6
then if you want to get their attention

1666.96 --> 1673.1200000000001
copy their rules and engage and then

1669.6 --> 1676.799
you have the potential to get noticed

1673.12 --> 1680.08
that those groups will think hey

1676.799 --> 1682.559
this person is on our level

1680.08 --> 1684.0
we could use them we could communicate

1682.559 --> 1687.039
with them we can

1684.0 --> 1690.0
uphold our specific

1687.039 --> 1692.96
level and our dream and that works it

1690.0 --> 1692.96
really does work

1694.799 --> 1700.559
if you abide by those rules

1697.919 --> 1702.3200000000002
of those people engaging in the game

1700.559 --> 1706.08
because they're playing their own game

1702.32 --> 1706.08
they're playing their own dance on their

1708.84 --> 1711.84
level

1713.44 --> 1721.039
it takes two to tango yeah

1717.039 --> 1721.039
hello julio pavon by the way good to see

1722.84 --> 1725.84
you

1729.44 --> 1732.0800000000002
oh god

1733.84 --> 1742.08
oh man oh i'm remembering things now

1738.48 --> 1743.039
it's all coming back to me owen benjamin

1742.08 --> 1747.76
like his skit

1743.039 --> 1752.08
oh my god like he has a new

1747.76 --> 1755.52
character sort of thing

1752.08 --> 1758.6399999999999
to emphasize the uh what is it the role

1755.52 --> 1761.12
reversal within the west

1758.64 --> 1761.8400000000001
thanks to also porn influences and all

1761.12 --> 1764.9599999999998
that

1761.84 --> 1767.76
god so had like

1764.96 --> 1769.1200000000001
the butch woman that's basically

1767.76 --> 1771.12
behaving like

1769.12 --> 1772.8799999999999
anti-social male truckers like

1771.12 --> 1775.84
chauvinist male truckers but

1772.88 --> 1778.0
for a woman and he had this whole story

1775.84 --> 1781.039
put down and it's really creepy because

1778.0 --> 1783.679
it's slightly exaggerated

1781.039 --> 1784.399
there's a whole bunch of [ __ ] that's

1783.679 --> 1787.52
totally

1784.399 --> 1788.799
on target like i almost see that out

1787.52 --> 1793.279
there sometimes

1788.799 --> 1793.279
and it creeped me out every time

1793.44 --> 1801.52
so yeah he really put down that scene

1798.48 --> 1801.52
very eloquently

1801.84 --> 1805.76
there's probably a whole lot of people

1803.52 --> 1806.32
out there that just recognize it and

1805.76 --> 1810.0
then just

1806.32 --> 1813.6
shudder like oh [ __ ]

1810.0 --> 1822.96
damn he's right man this is not good

1813.6 --> 1826.399
this is totally out of whack

1822.96 --> 1829.44
a slow mo moon buggy

1826.399 --> 1837.1999999999998
yeah yesterday's g t episode was amazing

1829.44 --> 1839.52
i agree

1837.2 --> 1839.52
what

1842.48 --> 1846.159
the earth is flat as my frequency was

1845.12 --> 1850.6399999999999
right

1846.159 --> 1853.5200000000002
that's that's yeah that is dude you

1850.64 --> 1856.48
nathan you you're holding the actual

1853.52 --> 1856.48
flat earth line

1856.799 --> 1863.279
i feel something i feel like almost like

1861.2 --> 1865.039
don't take this out of whack it's an

1863.279 --> 1867.36
over generalization

1865.039 --> 1868.559
but it feels to me almost sometimes like

1867.36 --> 1870.4799999999998
you are actually

1868.559 --> 1872.399
holding that you're one of the last

1870.48 --> 1875.84
people that's actually holding that

1872.399 --> 1876.799
the old line well everybody's just kind

1875.84 --> 1879.039
of

1876.799 --> 1881.9189999999999
wandering off in other parts of the

1879.039 --> 1881.919
dance of the beast

1882.48 --> 1889.84
and you're holding it at right there

1886.399 --> 1890.4799999999998
it's like no earth is flat and when you

1889.84 --> 1892.9599999999998
look at it

1890.48 --> 1895.519
like that and then reflect on everything

1892.96 --> 1897.519
else then also the dance of the beast is

1895.519 --> 1899.84
revealed

1897.519 --> 1902.0
it is revealed that it is a dance that

1899.84 --> 1904.6399999999999
it does incorporate

1902.0 --> 1905.279
nonsense stories that play into the

1904.64 --> 1908.5590000000002
feelings

1905.279 --> 1908.559
and dreams of people

1915.12 --> 1919.12
right i'm very happy that basically you

1918.559 --> 1921.2
do it

1919.12 --> 1924.32
like that nathan and man you are getting

1921.2 --> 1927.6000000000001
a whole lot of [ __ ] for it too

1924.32 --> 1929.6789999999999
you know we got plenty of supporters and

1927.6 --> 1932.24
people that go around the social media

1929.679 --> 1933.44
that definitely recognize it and they're

1932.24 --> 1935.76
like soldiers

1933.44 --> 1937.1200000000001
they present themselves like this it's

1935.76 --> 1939.6
like yes we do it

1937.12 --> 1940.7199999999998
we're gonna keep it on the front line

1939.6 --> 1944.6399999999999
we're gonna keep it

1940.72 --> 1946.0
real no at the point of the spell

1944.64 --> 1948.96
breaking

1946.0 --> 1950.559
and keep it there as the opponents all

1948.96 --> 1952.799
just wander off in

1950.559 --> 1954.1589999999999
exotic thoughts and double think

1952.799 --> 1956.24
nonsense constantly

1954.159 --> 1957.7600000000002
constantly blooming with exotic double

1956.24 --> 1960.08
think

1957.76 --> 1961.679
i like that terminology exotic double

1960.08 --> 1963.6
think

1961.679 --> 1966.799
isn't that what it is now what the

1963.6 --> 1966.799
ballers do a lot of them

1966.96 --> 1970.64
right trenchers

1973.12 --> 1977.84
yeah that what the trenches jado really

1978.399 --> 1981.76
yeah that's a trenches is all about

1980.64 --> 1986.3200000000002
engagement

1981.76 --> 1988.72
between like the hardcore fundies

1986.32 --> 1989.36
and the flat earthers that really want

1988.72 --> 1993.84
to keep it

1989.36 --> 1993.84
to the baseline those are the trenches

1994.24 --> 1999.279
well each side well especially the

1996.799 --> 2000.32
baller side has a whole range of palaces

1999.279 --> 2002.48
with media

2000.32 --> 2005.519
and just dream factories spreading it

2002.48 --> 2008.08
all over the place

2005.519 --> 2010.3990000000001
we don't have that bigger palaces on our

2008.08 --> 2010.399
side

2012.48 --> 2017.6
but we do have good communication better

2015.519 --> 2018.88
communication instead of centralized

2017.6 --> 2022.399
broadcasting

2018.88 --> 2023.3600000000001
we have more person-to-person

2022.399 --> 2027.84
communication

2023.36 --> 2027.84
on our side of the trenches

2031.039 --> 2037.039
because yeah we don't have to deal

2034.24 --> 2038.32
or we have less trouble dealing with

2037.039 --> 2043.12
people

2038.32 --> 2045.36
that engage in exotic double speak

2043.12 --> 2046.9599999999998
because we're trained to spot it out

2045.36 --> 2050.0
while the other side

2046.96 --> 2052.079
is trained to produce it so they're all

2050.0 --> 2053.52
focused on producing that [ __ ]

2052.079 --> 2055.679
constantly how do we

2053.52 --> 2057.2
quickly conjure it up in a believable

2055.679 --> 2059.44
fashion

2057.2 --> 2061.7599999999998
right to uphold the dream to be that

2059.44 --> 2063.599
part of the dance of the beast

2061.76 --> 2065.3590000000004
and they're getting very good at it but

2063.599 --> 2066.159
at the same time because they constantly

2065.359 --> 2069.839
do it they

2066.159 --> 2072.7200000000003
are not very good at spotting it

2069.839 --> 2075.119
only getting that frequency right the

2072.72 --> 2076.7999999999997
belief frequency

2075.119 --> 2078.56
that's their aim that's their focus of

2076.8 --> 2082.079
their consciousness in that process

2078.56 --> 2083.679
not in figuring out when something's

2082.079 --> 2085.9190000000003
wrong when something's right and that is

2083.679 --> 2086.56
what we do on our side con that's a

2085.919 --> 2090.0789999999997
totally

2086.56 --> 2091.7599999999998
opposite focus pick out the fallacies

2090.079 --> 2094.96
pick out the structural

2091.76 --> 2097.599
failure constantly

2094.96 --> 2099.04
like an architect the whole thing is it

2097.599 --> 2101.6800000000003
built right is that where

2099.04 --> 2103.92
is where basically the building exp

2101.68 --> 2107.1189999999997
inspectors

2103.92 --> 2109.04
constantly like oh no

2107.119 --> 2111.2000000000003
no there's there's the hole in the

2109.04 --> 2117.839
foundation you gotta fix this or

2111.2 --> 2117.839
or it's gonna be disapproved

2128.079 --> 2144.88
right and it's good it's good and

2131.2 --> 2147.1189999999997
safe valuable to be rigid like that

2144.88 --> 2149.52
i thought you have your own dance moves

2147.119 --> 2151.44
now adam meekin

2149.52 --> 2153.04
good to see you by the way oh and

2151.44 --> 2159.839
pumpkin

2153.04 --> 2159.839
carrot 306.

2162.48 --> 2166.8
right but let's just say every part of

2165.2 --> 2168.8799999999997
it is also that like

2166.8 --> 2172.4
the whole mask situation and the

2168.88 --> 2175.52
vaccines it's also a dance of the beast

2172.4 --> 2178.56
it's like really what floats on top

2175.52 --> 2179.92
it's it's the easiest to figure out its

2178.56 --> 2183.359
complete nonsense

2179.92 --> 2186.079
the signs are all over it it is

2183.359 --> 2188.16
it is the part that is of the most

2186.079 --> 2191.2000000000003
exotic double speak

2188.16 --> 2194.64
this is where the double speak becomes

2191.2 --> 2197.5989999999997
more blatant and peer pressure becomes

2194.64 --> 2197.5989999999997
more maniacal

2197.92 --> 2201.839
right masks vaccines

2202.24 --> 2206.24
that's like really high up in the double

2204.96 --> 2209.04
think ladder

2206.24 --> 2209.9199999999996
of the dance of the beast and hey you

2209.04 --> 2212.32
know

2209.92 --> 2214.16
only thing you have to do is basically

2212.32 --> 2216.0
turn into one of that

2214.16 --> 2217.68
we don't even want to consider it i

2216.0 --> 2221.2
don't want to consider it

2217.68 --> 2224.24
but all you need to do is just engage

2221.2 --> 2226.0
and you're a part of that dance now and

2224.24 --> 2227.68
yeah can make other people's lives

2226.0 --> 2229.839
miserable with it

2227.68 --> 2231.839
and that's how it is because it is right

2229.839 --> 2236.32
there for the picking

2231.839 --> 2236.32
that dark poisoned fruit is right there

2236.8 --> 2243.599
dance moves you already got the playbook

2240.4 --> 2247.119
if you engage then that machine

2243.599 --> 2257.839
it's all set up for you to be that part

2247.119 --> 2257.839
of the dance of the beast very dark part

2271.52 --> 2275.52
right and there's also the much much

2274.56 --> 2279.359
more difficult

2275.52 --> 2282.4
dance part to counter it to really be

2279.359 --> 2286.64
overtly out there and against it

2282.4 --> 2286.64
it's pretty tense it's pretty

2286.8 --> 2290.7200000000003
dangerous in a way psychologically

2288.56 --> 2292.32
dangerous because all the people that do

2290.72 --> 2294.72
engage in that

2292.32 --> 2296.0
that do dance that dance they're all

2294.72 --> 2298.64
very tight

2296.0 --> 2300.32
they're all very peer pressured so if

2298.64 --> 2302.48
you gauge against that there's always

2300.32 --> 2305.52
going to be a lot of friction

2302.48 --> 2307.92
unless you manage to somehow avoid that

2305.52 --> 2312.4
now i try to avoid it

2307.92 --> 2314.96
but i'm under a lot of tension right

2312.4 --> 2318.64
because i don't wear a mask like even in

2314.96 --> 2320.48
a supermarket i don't have to

2318.64 --> 2322.16
i got an exemption card and all that i

2320.48 --> 2324.8
don't even show it

2322.16 --> 2324.7999999999997
they know it

2325.52 --> 2329.359
but other people do and there is tension

2327.76 --> 2330.48
and i'm not gonna like

2329.359 --> 2332.4
throw out of walking through the

2330.48 --> 2335.359
supermarket tell everybody you

2332.4 --> 2335.359
don't wear a mask

2335.44 --> 2341.839
right because

2338.48 --> 2341.839
they probably know

2343.76 --> 2348.2400000000002
or they just don't want to know anymore

2348.56 --> 2352.32
so they're just doing the autopilot

2350.32 --> 2354.56
they're playing the standard part

2352.32 --> 2356.0
the standard compliance part of the

2354.56 --> 2357.599
dance of the beast

2356.0 --> 2359.52
doesn't mean that they really are going

2357.599 --> 2361.76
to enforce that on others i

2359.52 --> 2362.72
barely come across those types you know

2361.76 --> 2366.1600000000003
really like

2362.72 --> 2368.3199999999997
well what's kind of been called cairns

2366.16 --> 2369.68
that really is like try to make you wear

2368.32 --> 2372.1600000000003
a mask

2369.68 --> 2374.3999999999996
unless it's like part of their specific

2372.16 --> 2378.7999999999997
job routine

2374.4 --> 2378.8
in certain types of bigger stores

2380.4 --> 2386.079
to enforce policy right

2384.0 --> 2387.28
but overall i barely come across people

2386.079 --> 2389.2000000000003
that really

2387.28 --> 2391.6800000000003
do that because they think that's the

2389.2 --> 2397.839
right thing to do

2391.68 --> 2397.839
very happy about that

2401.76 --> 2406.7200000000003
science doesn't prove anything no reason

2404.16 --> 2406.72
i did it

2408.56 --> 2412.88
that it's but do still still people say

2412.16 --> 2416.48
that

2412.88 --> 2418.319
israel her nunes

2416.48 --> 2422.16
science doesn't prove anything is it

2418.319 --> 2422.16
still just used as an argument

2422.24 --> 2429.1189999999997
the only times i ever hear that is when

2426.0 --> 2431.52
the scientific method is addressed as to

2429.119 --> 2433.6800000000003
what it really is

2431.52 --> 2436.0
then i hear that response science

2433.68 --> 2439.9199999999996
doesn't prove anything

2436.0 --> 2444.24
but other than that it's never used

2439.92 --> 2444.2400000000002
so it really is just a excuse

2445.599 --> 2449.04
and besides it's wrong because science

2447.52 --> 2452.96
definitely proves things

2449.04 --> 2455.92
like even doesn't even matter what

2452.96 --> 2456.4
because it either proves the cause of an

2455.92 --> 2460.2400000000002
effect

2456.4 --> 2460.2400000000002
correct or it proves it wrong

2460.319 --> 2465.839
so either way even if your idea

2463.44 --> 2467.28
of the setup is flimsy if your cause is

2465.839 --> 2469.68
kind of flimsy

2467.28 --> 2471.0400000000004
then it can be disproven through the

2469.68 --> 2481.839
method

2471.04 --> 2481.839
so it always proves something

2486.72 --> 2490.0
right specifically proving something

2489.2 --> 2495.839
wrong

2490.0 --> 2495.839
is proving something

2521.359 --> 2523.839
hmm

2548.839 --> 2554.0789999999997
what

2551.68 --> 2554.72
right and it's interesting for me too

2554.079 --> 2557.119
you know

2554.72 --> 2558.24
i do keep an eye out on people in

2557.119 --> 2561.599
general

2558.24 --> 2564.64
when i go out for groceries and stuff

2561.599 --> 2567.44
and i just noticed that like

2564.64 --> 2568.8799999999997
the spirit level in people's eyes so

2567.44 --> 2571.68
different

2568.88 --> 2572.7200000000003
and some people really don't wear masks

2571.68 --> 2576.24
and they're like

2572.72 --> 2578.48
aware like they're aware of

2576.24 --> 2580.8799999999997
that people might be triggered about

2578.48 --> 2583.44
that and all that

2580.88 --> 2585.52
and they're still like holding on to

2583.44 --> 2587.52
that so they have more spirit like they

2585.52 --> 2590.079
have more will

2587.52 --> 2591.359
to do that and not just baseline

2590.079 --> 2593.44
surrender

2591.359 --> 2594.72
so it's interesting to see that out

2593.44 --> 2597.92
there as well and

2594.72 --> 2600.3999999999996
yeah all these people i don't know them

2597.92 --> 2603.04
some i recognize from just repeatingly

2600.4 --> 2606.88
seeing them over the years

2603.04 --> 2609.68
but still yeah you you it's a big city

2606.88 --> 2611.2000000000003
there's a lot of people here and always

2609.68 --> 2614.96
bumping it or well always

2611.2 --> 2618.839
seeing new people every day

2614.96 --> 2621.839
and seeing some back

2618.839 --> 2621.839
regularly

2630.16 --> 2636.319
but also it's weird man because

2633.359 --> 2638.72
even people that want to be compliant

2636.319 --> 2642.079
sometimes like they're confused about

2638.72 --> 2645.4399999999996
things too like

2642.079 --> 2645.44
the ones that want to

2645.68 --> 2652.8799999999997
be good like help out with corona like

2649.2 --> 2654.7999999999997
they are confused too

2652.88 --> 2656.48
i think that it's starting to seep in

2654.8 --> 2659.44
even with them that

2656.48 --> 2662.079
like the messaging concerning this

2659.44 --> 2666.319
solution of the corona situation is

2662.079 --> 2669.44
just it's not coherent

2666.319 --> 2672.079
it really isn't like

2669.44 --> 2674.079
every source just starts contradicting

2672.079 --> 2676.8
things

2674.079 --> 2678.319
and conflicting and i think that even a

2676.8 --> 2680.319
lot of the

2678.319 --> 2681.52
like goody two-shoe normies that are

2680.319 --> 2684.56
just not very

2681.52 --> 2686.0
smart not very bright they want to do

2684.56 --> 2687.04
their best i think they are getting

2686.0 --> 2690.16
confused too they're

2687.04 --> 2691.2799999999997
like they're feeling the heat like uh i

2690.16 --> 2693.359
want to do it right

2691.28 --> 2694.7200000000003
but i don't know anymore it's getting

2693.359 --> 2698.319
really confusing

2694.72 --> 2701.4399999999996
so what do we do and then

2698.319 --> 2704.4
people kind of come together and make up

2701.44 --> 2705.64
ideas on how to best combat it almost

2704.4 --> 2708.96
like

2705.64 --> 2711.359
kindergarteners having given a mission

2708.96 --> 2713.119
by a teacher like oh you got to do this

2711.359 --> 2715.359
and then they come together and like oh

2713.119 --> 2717.44
how are we going to address this issue

2715.359 --> 2719.68
it's very weird to see it happen out

2717.44 --> 2723.2000000000003
there and it does happen i see this

2719.68 --> 2726.56
i recognize the spirit at a distance

2723.2 --> 2733.839
because of the composure of the people

2726.56 --> 2733.839
i see it it's weird

2767.92 --> 2774.0
they are focused for sure exactly

2772.079 --> 2776.96
who specifically are you referring to in

2774.0 --> 2778.88
this case christopher newton

2776.96 --> 2781.52
say most of them hand wave away

2778.88 --> 2781.52
confusion

2781.76 --> 2788.8
and well they're not gonna get like all

2785.92 --> 2789.839
triggered by it they just put it aside

2788.8 --> 2792.88
but they are

2789.839 --> 2794.4
kind of like the the ones that try to

2792.88 --> 2798.2400000000002
comply they don't

2794.4 --> 2800.2400000000002
they can't see any cohesion anymore

2798.24 --> 2800.8799999999997
right it's basically the cohesion that

2800.24 --> 2803.68
is

2800.88 --> 2805.44
that that level is trying to force them

2803.68 --> 2809.04
to surrender

2805.44 --> 2812.48
to just be responsive automatons

2809.04 --> 2817.839
and a lot of people are feeling that

2812.48 --> 2817.839
and are just not gonna do that

2819.68 --> 2826.72
and that's good it's a better response

2823.2 --> 2831.4399999999996
to just figure out this is not coherent

2826.72 --> 2834.64
there's something wrong here

2831.44 --> 2837.28
it's very relieving to see that

2834.64 --> 2839.44
in opposition to people that are just

2837.28 --> 2840.3190000000004
going to parrot whatever they last heard

2839.44 --> 2842.48
about it and

2840.319 --> 2844.079
gonna get pushy with that on other

2842.48 --> 2846.2400000000002
people you know

2844.079 --> 2847.52
much better to have people just see it

2846.24 --> 2851.4399999999996
and just like i

2847.52 --> 2854.64
don't really know anymore man

2851.44 --> 2856.8
i'm i'm just trying to get by

2854.64 --> 2859.839
that's better you know it's not ideal

2856.8 --> 2859.8390000000004
but it's better

2879.76 --> 2886.559
e thank you israel hernandez for the

2883.2 --> 2889.1189999999997
499 super chat donation

2886.559 --> 2890.96
how are we going to get terrain theory

2889.119 --> 2893.04
to the forefront of the conversation on

2890.96 --> 2896.96
health and wellness

2893.04 --> 2899.7599999999998
uh well

2896.96 --> 2901.04
the only way it's really gonna happen if

2899.76 --> 2904.3190000000004
is

2901.04 --> 2908.079
if the well let's just call them the

2904.319 --> 2909.599
alternative doctors the ones that have

2908.079 --> 2912.559
stepped away that have

2909.599 --> 2915.2000000000003
recognized the corona situation for the

2912.559 --> 2917.28
giant fraud psychological warfare

2915.2 --> 2921.1189999999997
operation that it is

2917.28 --> 2921.119
for them to be able to truly

2921.839 --> 2925.04
find like a new standard that's going to

2924.4 --> 2929.359
be

2925.04 --> 2931.599
reaching wider in the public awareness

2929.359 --> 2934.0
you know there has to be some kind of

2931.599 --> 2937.3590000000004
stable situation

2934.0 --> 2940.4
in order for people to start

2937.359 --> 2943.839
to trust it enough to tap into that

2940.4 --> 2943.839
to kind of test it out

2945.2 --> 2952.319
like i've been trying to share my

2949.599 --> 2954.96
my approach the way i i've done things

2952.319 --> 2956.599
and terrain theory is part of that too

2954.96 --> 2958.88
and just my understanding of the

2956.599 --> 2961.44
microbiology like how

2958.88 --> 2962.2400000000002
psychosomatics is incredibly important

2961.44 --> 2965.839
too

2962.24 --> 2966.72
to really live that very strictly live

2965.839 --> 2970.88
that

2966.72 --> 2974.0789999999997
like yeah i am living that

2970.88 --> 2976.96
i really am it was very bizarre at first

2974.079 --> 2984.2400000000002
to realize like yeah i am living that

2976.96 --> 2989.76
it works and i must trust it works

2984.24 --> 2989.7599999999998
and yeah lo and behold it works

2989.92 --> 2993.839
but you can't do it halfway you really

2993.119 --> 2998.6400000000003
have to

2993.839 --> 3000.0
be focused and have control over where

2998.64 --> 3001.04
your spirit is going to wonder where

3000.0 --> 3004.4
your thoughts are going to wander

3001.04 --> 3004.4
because of psychosomatics

3005.599 --> 3013.839
and yeah it works works very well for me

3013.92 --> 3020.88
but yeah over time more people will step

3017.359 --> 3023.44
away from the broken bottom line medical

3020.88 --> 3027.28
system that's just utterly corrupted now

3023.44 --> 3030.319
thanks to the corona project

3027.28 --> 3032.3190000000004
that was enrolled yeah as soon as

3030.319 --> 3035.44
there's an alternative

3032.319 --> 3038.5589999999997
stabilizing then people will start to

3035.44 --> 3041.04
try and figure it out like that you know

3038.559 --> 3042.3190000000004
it's already a lot of people that have

3041.04 --> 3046.24
like in the last

3042.319 --> 3049.359
10 20 years through alternative media

3046.24 --> 3049.359
all kinds of sources

3049.52 --> 3054.0
putting it together like i have there's

3051.839 --> 3057.2
many others out there

3054.0 --> 3057.2
but at some point

3058.079 --> 3068.0
yeah there might be an opportunity if

3061.52 --> 3071.839
if it just gets to survive

3068.0 --> 3075.2
that people will basically step towards

3071.839 --> 3078.5589999999997
that frequency

3075.2 --> 3079.04
and start realizing like yes this makes

3078.559 --> 3081.28
sense

3079.04 --> 3084.079
yes there's actually practical examples

3081.28 --> 3087.0400000000004
yes there's actually physical studies

3084.079 --> 3089.04
this makes more sense highlighting the

3087.04 --> 3091.92
old mistakes

3089.04 --> 3094.64
like what what i pointed out the other

3091.92 --> 3098.2400000000002
day was it yesterday

3094.64 --> 3101.319
about virus tests how they basically

3098.24 --> 3103.2799999999997
get a sample and then they measure the

3101.319 --> 3106.48
percentage

3103.28 --> 3109.599
of exosomes why

3106.48 --> 3110.8
because there's always they're always

3109.599 --> 3113.119
there

3110.8 --> 3114.48
it's a it's a part of the metabolism

3113.119 --> 3118.0
it's always there

3114.48 --> 3121.68
it's not like oh my god an infectious

3118.0 --> 3123.359
agent no it's that's actually not even

3121.68 --> 3125.5989999999997
kind of what the test is for it's more

3123.359 --> 3128.0789999999997
like a test of the condition like

3125.599 --> 3130.079
because if you have a certain percentage

3128.079 --> 3132.7200000000003
it's correlated

3130.079 --> 3134.2400000000002
with having a certain symptomatic thing

3132.72 --> 3136.24
having a disease

3134.24 --> 3137.68
and that's then how they test you

3136.24 --> 3140.8799999999997
positive

3137.68 --> 3142.72
right adam it would be nice to get a

3140.88 --> 3143.92
confirmation from somebody that's more

3142.72 --> 3148.0
studied

3143.92 --> 3151.6800000000003
officially into that i'm just a laven

3148.0 --> 3151.68
i never got a doctorate or anything

3151.76 --> 3158.559
but yeah like

3155.04 --> 3162.079
just to point out that the the idea

3158.559 --> 3165.0400000000004
of viruses is just so outdated

3162.079 --> 3167.3590000000004
it's like a it's it's a century-old

3165.04 --> 3170.5589999999997
discarded concept

3167.359 --> 3173.2799999999997
kind of like newton's gravity

3170.559 --> 3174.4
right newton's gravity is very very

3173.28 --> 3177.3590000000004
outdated

3174.4 --> 3178.079
yet people still believe that [ __ ] they

3177.359 --> 3180.88
still

3178.079 --> 3181.76
utilize that mechanical approach in

3180.88 --> 3185.599
their

3181.76 --> 3187.8390000000004
virtual constructions they still use it

3185.599 --> 3188.7200000000003
i still use it sometimes because it's to

3187.839 --> 3191.2
me it's just

3188.72 --> 3192.0
yeah playing with legos virtual legos so

3191.2 --> 3193.839
i'm also

3192.0 --> 3195.68
yeah i can do whatever the [ __ ] i want

3193.839 --> 3197.839
because i know it's just

3195.68 --> 3209.7599999999998
virtual i'm not gonna reify anything

3197.839 --> 3214.319
about it

3209.76 --> 3214.3190000000004
it's a bit more specific from their

3220.839 --> 3226.16
claim

3223.76 --> 3227.5200000000004
right but in general that is like how

3226.16 --> 3232.16
they test it right

3227.52 --> 3232.16
just percentage of exosomes

3232.88 --> 3238.4
this is what i picked up when i learned

3235.68 --> 3238.3999999999996
about the test

3239.599 --> 3242.96
also that the the maker of the test that

3242.4 --> 3244.8
yeah

3242.96 --> 3246.64
this claimed like this doesn't actually

3244.8 --> 3249.3590000000004
work

3246.64 --> 3250.0789999999997
remember that part now there's there's

3249.359 --> 3253.2799999999997
other tests

3250.079 --> 3255.92
probably since then but still

3253.28 --> 3256.7200000000003
like it's just very telling like what

3255.92 --> 3259.44
they say

3256.72 --> 3261.359
infectious agent like it's all of it is

3259.44 --> 3266.4
completely irrelevant

3261.359 --> 3270.64
it's totally irrelevant is no infection

3266.4 --> 3274.319
it's not what it's about these

3270.64 --> 3278.48
exosomes these micro things they are not

3274.319 --> 3281.599
an infectious agent they're not

3278.48 --> 3284.079
it's a part of the metabolic systems of

3281.599 --> 3284.079
the body

3290.48 --> 3297.92
so yeah one could consider that

3294.16 --> 3301.2
things like the flu and getting a cold

3297.92 --> 3303.359
and what is considered as corona it has

3301.2 --> 3305.68
more to do with the overall body's

3303.359 --> 3308.24
condition

3305.68 --> 3309.44
than it does with some infectious agent

3308.24 --> 3313.5989999999997
so infection

3309.44 --> 3313.599
is basically has nothing to do with it

3315.76 --> 3321.8390000000004
it's all about the body's condition

3323.119 --> 3327.04
that's why even very early on when this

3326.0 --> 3329.359
all rolled out

3327.04 --> 3332.079
it became very apparent co-morbidity

3329.359 --> 3334.799
somebody having all kinds of issues

3332.079 --> 3337.28
right on the brink yeah they get it they

3334.799 --> 3337.28
get the

3337.68 --> 3341.68
the the physical response of it and then

3340.24 --> 3345.359
they die

3341.68 --> 3347.2799999999997
from comorbidity right because it's

3345.359 --> 3349.92
about the body's condition it's not

3347.28 --> 3349.92
really an

3360.839 --> 3366.0
infection

3362.079 --> 3366.0
my god seeking star water really

3374.839 --> 3377.839
why

3390.4 --> 3394.079
have you been able to talk to them about

3392.72 --> 3405.839
it

3394.079 --> 3405.8390000000004
like why are they doing that

3417.599 --> 3423.28
but okay i'll not get to push it it's

3430.839 --> 3435.2799999999997
tough

3432.64 --> 3436.319
right so they're caught that means that

3435.28 --> 3438.1600000000003
means

3436.319 --> 3440.319
they got terrorized they got

3438.16 --> 3440.799
psychologically terrorized seeking star

3440.319 --> 3443.92
wars

3440.799 --> 3446.319
by probably doctors

3443.92 --> 3447.839
probably watching cnn or something

3446.319 --> 3451.92
crappy like that

3447.839 --> 3451.92
yeah they get caught up in a spell

3453.52 --> 3457.92
and it will probably feel like that like

3455.92 --> 3458.88
you can't grab their attention that's

3457.92 --> 3464.16
because they're

3458.88 --> 3466.96
literally in a terror spell

3464.16 --> 3468.8799999999997
cycling on the inside through nightmare

3466.96 --> 3475.839
visions

3468.88 --> 3475.839
that's terror spellbound

3477.76 --> 3483.119
you can snap them out of it but in ways

3481.04 --> 3489.2
you gotta get

3483.119 --> 3492.799
pretty energetic to do it

3489.2 --> 3495.359
laying it out exactly

3492.799 --> 3497.04
like for example it's not a vaccine it's

3495.359 --> 3500.0789999999997
not even claimed to help

3497.04 --> 3502.96
the only reason why they say take it it

3500.079 --> 3504.2400000000002
or it'll go away is because they want

3502.96 --> 3507.359
literally

3504.24 --> 3510.24
certain amounts of deaths and people

3507.359 --> 3513.7599999999998
that are mutilated by it

3510.24 --> 3517.839
for their their crisis result whatever

3513.76 --> 3517.8390000000004
they're trying to program

3518.4 --> 3522.0
and not because a disease is being

3521.04 --> 3525.52
stopped that

3522.0 --> 3529.2
is a total lie

3525.52 --> 3533.599
total lie it has nothing to do

3529.2 --> 3536.8799999999997
with that it's literally take this stuff

3533.599 --> 3540.0
and we might stop

3536.88 --> 3542.559
terrorizing you with this [ __ ] that's

3540.0 --> 3542.559
what it is

3542.64 --> 3546.8799999999997
taking this supposed vaccine that's not

3545.2 --> 3551.4399999999996
actually a vaccine

3546.88 --> 3551.44
is literally not going to stop any

3556.839 --> 3559.839
disease

3561.44 --> 3564.799
well seeking star wars that

3566.559 --> 3570.079
you got to get through them you got to

3568.079 --> 3573.8390000000004
give them a reason to go

3570.079 --> 3573.8390000000004
on you know

3574.64 --> 3580.24
like i try to tell all their people

3577.76 --> 3582.2400000000002
that are get risking getting caught up

3580.24 --> 3585.5989999999997
in it or that are trying to resist

3582.24 --> 3588.64
i tell them we need you

3585.599 --> 3591.44
we need you to survive we need your

3588.64 --> 3594.16
memories we need your spirit

3591.44 --> 3594.48
like it might seem to you maybe in ways

3594.16 --> 3596.96
you're

3594.48 --> 3597.68
sort of useless or whatever it's not

3596.96 --> 3600.799
important

3597.68 --> 3603.839
we need you to survive this

3600.799 --> 3606.64
to have you as a reference

3603.839 --> 3607.68
to just have you as somebody that

3606.64 --> 3611.2799999999997
experienced the

3607.68 --> 3611.2799999999997
the the past

3612.079 --> 3618.559
yeah that's what i try to do because

3615.52 --> 3620.24
you know old people they under all this

3618.559 --> 3621.6800000000003
pressure they kind of like just want to

3620.24 --> 3624.0789999999997
go away

3621.68 --> 3625.2799999999997
because they think they're useless

3624.079 --> 3628.48
sometimes and

3625.28 --> 3631.6800000000003
if you get treated like that then that

3628.48 --> 3631.68
that only aggravates

3631.76 --> 3635.0400000000004
so yeah that's what i try to do just

3634.4 --> 3638.079
like

3635.04 --> 3639.92
no it's important we need you we need

3638.079 --> 3642.96
you to survive through this

3639.92 --> 3644.079
also to be a proof afterward that it is

3642.96 --> 3645.76
all [ __ ]

3644.079 --> 3647.76
that there is no disease that's

3645.76 --> 3651.5200000000004
literally killing off everybody

3647.76 --> 3654.559
because you didn't take it and you lived

3651.52 --> 3657.359
and thrived for that time

3654.559 --> 3658.2400000000002
proving it's [ __ ] we need the

3657.359 --> 3661.2799999999997
evidence

3658.24 --> 3664.319
of surviving elderly people to prove

3661.28 --> 3666.3190000000004
that it is all [ __ ] that there is no

3664.319 --> 3670.319
infectious disease that it's all a

3666.319 --> 3673.839
fraud and we need them to survive to

3670.319 --> 3678.72
take the fraudulent people that do this

3673.839 --> 3682.0789999999997
down we need them to survive

3678.72 --> 3687.04
to have proof

3682.079 --> 3687.04
to take the people that did this down

3689.599 --> 3693.28
surviving is revenge

3694.799 --> 3701.68
or justice i guess better word for it

3698.64 --> 3702.8799999999997
right that's what i try to tell them but

3701.68 --> 3706.319
yeah they have to

3702.88 --> 3706.319
be able to handle the world

3706.48 --> 3708.72
so

3709.68 --> 3713.839
that's my strategy

3721.2 --> 3724.8799999999997
yeah elderly rarely think younger family

3723.839 --> 3727.599
members know stuff

3724.88 --> 3728.799
so you gotta prove it to them you gotta

3727.599 --> 3732.88
get real with them

3728.799 --> 3735.92
you gotta address them as if they were

3732.88 --> 3739.2000000000003
in their peaks in their life

3735.92 --> 3744.079
like really take them serious

3739.2 --> 3744.0789999999997
conjure up the deeper spirit get

3752.839 --> 3758.48
real

3755.039 --> 3759.76
proof won't help what now what i talked

3758.48 --> 3762.2400000000002
about sks

3759.76 --> 3763.2000000000003
was about why we need them on the long

3762.24 --> 3768.0
run why do we

3763.2 --> 3770.8799999999997
need the elderly not to give up and die

3768.0 --> 3771.359
we need proof that the whole corona

3770.88 --> 3774.799
thing

3771.359 --> 3776.96
is all a fraud we need them to survive

3774.799 --> 3780.96
to prove that to show

3776.96 --> 3784.16
like it was all [ __ ] they're just

3780.96 --> 3784.16
all of it was [ __ ]

3792.16 --> 3797.839
right survival will be the proof

3798.72 --> 3811.839
we need against them against the ones

3802.079 --> 3811.8390000000004
that are executing this diabolical plan

3850.559 --> 3855.6800000000003
right yes slow mo moon buggy family

3853.76 --> 3859.119
dynamics can be a big fact when you try

3855.68 --> 3863.9199999999996
to tell them it's all nonsense

3859.119 --> 3867.359
well yeah if there's already like

3863.92 --> 3870.319
a pre-set up railroad that is like

3867.359 --> 3871.0389999999998
slipped in over the ages over the

3870.319 --> 3872.96
decades

3871.039 --> 3877.119
with the family member yeah then they'll

3872.96 --> 3877.119
be less likely to listen and [ __ ]

3877.839 --> 3882.0
and they'll even be proud proud about it

3879.839 --> 3883.119
yeah that that all depends on your

3882.0 --> 3887.039
relation with

3883.119 --> 3887.039
with that family member

3888.88 --> 3896.319
but you can if you have it in you appeal

3892.64 --> 3897.7599999999998
to their prime self by addressing them

3896.319 --> 3900.72
very seriously

3897.76 --> 3901.92
and basically expecting them to carry

3900.72 --> 3908.0789999999997
that spirit of

3901.92 --> 3910.0
how they were in their prime to remember

3908.079 --> 3923.8390000000004
you can try to appeal to that just

3910.0 --> 3923.839
getting very serious with it

3934.24 --> 3938.0
right well if they're gonna complain

3935.839 --> 3940.64
about you not being an expert

3938.0 --> 3942.799
then why don't you ask them do you know

3940.64 --> 3946.72
what an expert is

3942.799 --> 3946.72
how do you know they are an expert

3947.76 --> 3950.88
do you know what they're talking about

3949.76 --> 3955.76
or are you just

3950.88 --> 3959.44
blindly trusting in a group of people

3955.76 --> 3962.7200000000003
without seeking confirmation

3959.44 --> 3964.7200000000003
because then yeah it's not an expert

3962.72 --> 3967.1189999999997
it's a priest

3964.72 --> 3968.3999999999996
you gotta explain that to them like have

3967.119 --> 3970.2400000000002
you actually

3968.4 --> 3973.839
read into any of it did you do your

3970.24 --> 3977.7599999999998
research on the internet

3973.839 --> 3980.48
did you inquire with doctors

3977.76 --> 3982.6400000000003
like what do you think of this this part

3980.48 --> 3985.2
of this did you actually learn it

3982.64 --> 3987.2
or are you just listening to some guy on

3985.2 --> 3993.68
the television

3987.2 --> 3997.1189999999997
telling you what to do next right

3993.68 --> 3999.9199999999996
so if you are going to show

3997.119 --> 4000.319
them that you have inquired that you

3999.92 --> 4003.76
have

4000.319 --> 4004.64
researched then your expertise trumps

4003.76 --> 4007.119
theirs

4004.64 --> 4008.0789999999997
effectively in the moment you have that

4007.119 --> 4010.559
weight

4008.079 --> 4011.92
in that moment over them you could tell

4010.559 --> 4015.2000000000003
them like no

4011.92 --> 4018.2400000000002
you're trusting in something in a

4015.2 --> 4021.839
in a group of people on tv that you you

4018.24 --> 4021.839
don't even know who they are

4022.0 --> 4029.68
i have actually researched some of it

4025.039 --> 4032.079
i know more why are you not

4029.68 --> 4035.839
trusting my expertise i've actually

4032.079 --> 4035.8390000000004
looked into this

4038.96 --> 4044.0
right and then they'll either get

4040.88 --> 4049.839
extremely personally triggered

4044.0 --> 4049.839
or they will snap out of it

4052.24 --> 4058.16
it might in my opinion the risk is worth

4054.64 --> 4058.16
it but you got to build up to that

4060.839 --> 4063.839
carefully

4077.2 --> 4082.0
all right sks okay that's a sensible

4079.599 --> 4082.0
question

4086.64 --> 4093.0389999999998
all right okay well seeking are your

4090.48 --> 4094.559
grandparents are they christian by any

4093.039 --> 4097.679
chance

4094.559 --> 4100.4800000000005
because if they're made up their minds

4097.679 --> 4101.359
you could potentially remind them so

4100.48 --> 4105.759
you're made up

4101.359 --> 4110.0
your mind about this potential suicide

4105.759 --> 4111.679
right because that is what it is

4110.0 --> 4114.0
when you double down on that sort of

4111.679 --> 4118.4
thing like that

4114.0 --> 4120.64
it's not guaranteed necessarily but yeah

4118.4 --> 4123.04
it's there it's like russian roulette so

4120.64 --> 4124.08
is that okay is do you think a god is

4123.04 --> 4132.799
okay with that

4124.08 --> 4136.3189999999995
according to the bible

4132.799 --> 4138.48
right especially more elderly

4136.319 --> 4140.080000000001
tend to they come from an era where they

4138.48 --> 4141.199
take this sort of thing a little bit

4140.08 --> 4143.92
more serious

4141.199 --> 4146.96
than the average teenager and a teenager

4143.92 --> 4148.88
and all that convoluted

4146.96 --> 4150.319
garbage that they've been taught these

4148.88 --> 4151.92
days you know

4150.319 --> 4153.359
so they might take it a little bit more

4151.92 --> 4155.759
serious like oh you're

4153.359 --> 4157.04
you're actually gonna do it no matter

4155.759 --> 4159.279
what

4157.04 --> 4160.4
well i don't think god is very happy

4159.279 --> 4163.1990000000005
with you if you're

4160.4 --> 4175.839
going to risk suicide because you're too

4163.199 --> 4175.839
stubborn to deal with this

4179.839 --> 4184.159
i mean doesn't mean that you're

4181.359 --> 4189.839
necessarily gonna go to hell for it

4184.159 --> 4189.839
but it's not gonna make him happy

4193.759 --> 4197.04
you know i wouldn't go the the hell

4195.84 --> 4203.84
wrath kind of route

4197.04 --> 4203.84
that it's a little excessive perhaps

4205.04 --> 4209.84
but at least you can point out the basic

4207.36 --> 4209.839999999999
rules

4210.719 --> 4217.84
the rules from the bible the the basics

4213.6 --> 4217.84
the originals

4250.08 --> 4252.4
hmm

4253.199 --> 4259.839999999999
what what's uh isro

4256.88 --> 4259.84
what what is that

4284.84 --> 4287.84
uh

4290.56 --> 4294.8
oh man i think i'm doing a lot better

4294.0 --> 4298.32
today

4294.8 --> 4300.08
you guys agree two days ago i was just

4298.32 --> 4302.159
like completely out of it

4300.08 --> 4304.8
and yesterday it wasn't really that much

4302.159 --> 4308.0
better either

4304.8 --> 4308.0
but today i feel

4309.84 --> 4318.159000000001
yeah it's more stable what

4314.159 --> 4320.96
what is coming up flow is more regular

4318.159 --> 4322.639999999999
and i like addressing this subject it's

4320.96 --> 4323.199
necessary a lot of people are dealing

4322.64 --> 4326.320000000001
with it

4323.199 --> 4329.04
so yeah i found my my spot

4326.32 --> 4331.5199999999995
my spot to do my my part of the dance of

4329.04 --> 4331.5199999999995
the beast

4331.679 --> 4335.84
because i'm not gonna fool myself into

4333.52 --> 4340.080000000001
thinking that i'm not part of that

4335.84 --> 4340.08
as i already said like yeah

4340.56 --> 4344.8
you choose a path if you're going to

4343.12 --> 4346.159
engage with media you're going to make a

4344.8 --> 4357.84
point

4346.159 --> 4357.839999999999
but it's all part of it

4359.52 --> 4364.4800000000005
oh indian space research organization

4362.239 --> 4371.839999999999
okay

4364.48 --> 4371.839999999999
thanks now i know

4382.84 --> 4386.2390000000005
hmm

4384.32 --> 4388.719
all right well professor phil bell do

4386.239 --> 4392.48
they have a habit over there of taking

4388.719 --> 4392.4800000000005
like flu vaccines and [ __ ]

4394.0 --> 4398.08
because hey flu vaccines and all that

4396.32 --> 4402.96
crap have been around for

4398.08 --> 4404.88
a decade at least and there are people

4402.96 --> 4406.8
that are quite fanatical about getting

4404.88 --> 4409.92
that crap

4406.8 --> 4411.76
so like every time i hear that i was

4409.92 --> 4412.32
like oh this entire group got this it's

4411.76 --> 4416.08
like oh

4412.32 --> 4417.92
do they constantly take the flu vaccine

4416.08 --> 4420.32
you know that was even an issue 10 years

4417.92 --> 4422.159
ago remember with the swine flu and all

4420.32 --> 4424.84
that it was every time like oh did they

4422.159 --> 4427.5199999999995
actually take did they take it because

4424.84 --> 4430.4800000000005
yeah flu vaccines

4427.52 --> 4432.400000000001
when you take him you have more chance

4430.48 --> 4434.799999999999
of getting it whatever it's supposed to

4432.4 --> 4439.28
help against

4434.8 --> 4442.400000000001
and that builds up over time gets worse

4439.28 --> 4443.28
so that's always my first question oh

4442.4 --> 4445.92
this group

4443.28 --> 4447.36
got all got this disease oh so did did

4445.92 --> 4450.4
they take the vaccine

4447.36 --> 4453.44
did they it's just

4450.4 --> 4454.32
instant reflex because yeah that reflex

4453.44 --> 4457.36
turns out to be

4454.32 --> 4458.96
quite valuable

4457.36 --> 4469.759999999999
because it turns out that a lot of the

4458.96 --> 4474.88
times that's exactly what happened

4469.76 --> 4474.88
what okay sks what

4475.28 --> 4486.08
that's why

4482.719 --> 4487.44
see really murdering to silence that's

4486.08 --> 4489.76
quite a

4487.44 --> 4491.839999999999
quite a big step so what were they

4489.76 --> 4497.84
supposed to be silenced for in order to

4491.84 --> 4497.84
warrant all that

4512.56 --> 4516.64
oh hello by the way el yonke good to see

4522.84 --> 4539.84
you

4524.64 --> 4539.84
right anyway um be back two minutes

4621.36 --> 4623.839999999999
yo

4632.4 --> 4636.0
sending me warm greetings from dr gunzo

4635.36 --> 4639.599999999999
unicorn

4636.0 --> 4643.44
unicorn okay yeah i

4639.6 --> 4643.4400000000005
just don't want to talk to him for now

4644.64 --> 4651.84
like i i let them borrow in

4648.719 --> 4651.84
a little bit too much

4652.8 --> 4658.88
and then yeah i got a little bit weaker

4656.719 --> 4661.04
because i don't know the cycles my

4658.88 --> 4662.719
personal condition the situation over

4661.04 --> 4666.88
here i'm dealing with

4662.719 --> 4669.04
and i just don't want to deal with that

4666.88 --> 4670.96
for the time being you know eventually

4669.04 --> 4673.12
i'll probably unblock them again and all

4670.96 --> 4676.84
that it's just that for now i

4673.12 --> 4678.32
i really don't want their [ __ ] in my

4676.84 --> 4693.84
face

4678.32 --> 4693.84
just sick of it

4700.239 --> 4704.639999999999
all right is the world still flat and

4702.159 --> 4704.639999999999
beautiful

4705.84 --> 4712.08
it is picturesque it is still

4708.96 --> 4712.08
looking beautiful

4712.56 --> 4717.04
there's still beauty to behold

4715.44 --> 4719.199
thankfully

4717.04 --> 4721.199
and flat yeah of course it's flat it

4719.199 --> 4723.678999999999
always was flat

4721.199 --> 4735.839999999999
only place it ever changed away from

4723.679 --> 4735.84
that is in our imaginations

4747.44 --> 4750.799999999999
while seeking star wars i wouldn't call

4749.28 --> 4754.88
him rowdy

4750.8 --> 4754.88
more like just invasive

4757.04 --> 4763.12
like he lays claims on some on virtual

4760.64 --> 4765.360000000001
authority and [ __ ]

4763.12 --> 4768.8
like he he really thinks he's a doctor

4765.36 --> 4772.48
or something i don't know what it is

4768.8 --> 4772.4800000000005
but yeah i'm not buying that

4773.679 --> 4778.159
especially when he starts gaslighting on

4775.679 --> 4791.84
top of that like that's

4778.159 --> 4791.839999999999
yeah i don't appreciate that

4793.44 --> 4800.159
dude i don't need pictures from nasa

4797.12 --> 4803.199
i made a painting

4800.159 --> 4806.4
when i was like uh

4803.199 --> 4806.4
seven i think

4806.96 --> 4810.159
of outer space with the planet and the

4809.12 --> 4812.159
spaceship

4810.159 --> 4813.44
i made a painting like that when it was

4812.159 --> 4816.48
like seven

4813.44 --> 4819.839999999999
so i don't need nasa

4816.48 --> 4819.839999999999
for that

4834.48 --> 4837.599999999999
i think i still have it somewhere but i

4836.719 --> 4841.36
yeah

4837.6 --> 4846.08
it's probably in my storage one day

4841.36 --> 4846.88
one day i might have a better room and

4846.08 --> 4850.08
i'll have

4846.88 --> 4852.32
all the books available at the ready and

4850.08 --> 4854.5599999999995
all my pictures and drawings that i ever

4852.32 --> 4858.4
made that i still stored

4854.56 --> 4862.320000000001
i might show that stuff but dude i was

4858.4 --> 4865.5199999999995
into space big time as a kid

4862.32 --> 4868.96
space pictures space drawings

4865.52 --> 4871.76
spaceships space legos

4868.96 --> 4873.6
transformers especially the cybertronian

4871.76 --> 4876.2390000000005
age

4873.6 --> 4877.6
this is everything space freaking loved

4876.239 --> 4880.718999999999
that [ __ ]

4877.6 --> 4880.719
couldn't get enough of it

4886.159 --> 4889.839999999999
i was just one of those kids

4905.199 --> 4909.44
but at the same time also like i

4909.52 --> 4918.080000000001
i did always kind of compartmentalize it

4913.6 --> 4920.400000000001
it's like i believed in space

4918.08 --> 4922.719
but compartmentalized separate from the

4920.4 --> 4922.719
world

4923.04 --> 4926.48
always had this compartmentalization

4925.76 --> 4931.679
like that like

4926.48 --> 4936.718999999999
this is my dream people get the dream

4931.679 --> 4936.719
but it is like a dream and it's okay

4942.08 --> 4949.679
at the same time like getting to a level

4945.76 --> 4952.2390000000005
mentally that i would

4949.679 --> 4952.96
kind of by accident reify it and stuff

4952.239 --> 4959.839999999999
like

4952.96 --> 4959.84
make it real but

4961.36 --> 4966.32
yeah it was always like conjured up from

4963.92 --> 4966.32
within

4966.88 --> 4971.12
i don't know it's complicated it's kind

4969.28 --> 4974.5599999999995
of complicated thinking back about it

4971.12 --> 4977.76
like how i handled myself back then

4974.56 --> 4978.719
with this because there was always just

4977.76 --> 4986.639
a lot of power

4978.719 --> 4990.08
poured into it

4986.639 --> 4993.28
why do they have a gazillion missions

4990.08 --> 4996.4
i don't buy any of the footage that is

4993.28 --> 5002.719
no dude that's yeah but that's

4996.4 --> 5002.719
that's nasa like who needs them

5010.88 --> 5016.96
dude el juncker look

5014.4 --> 5018.96
like in 10 years there's going to be

5016.96 --> 5021.36
freaking rockets and

5018.96 --> 5022.0
stuff and pods and [ __ ] coming out of

5021.36 --> 5025.44
your ass

5022.0 --> 5026.8
everywhere they just want to force the

5025.44 --> 5029.12
indoctrination back

5026.8 --> 5031.04
they just want to make it into a culture

5029.12 --> 5032.08
into a subconscious culture so that

5031.04 --> 5035.04
everybody knows

5032.08 --> 5035.36
every [ __ ] thing about rocket science

5035.04 --> 5037.679
like

5035.36 --> 5038.799999999999
everybody becomes a rocket scientist

5037.679 --> 5041.4800000000005
everybody knows

5038.8 --> 5044.88
exactly how this shit's supposed to

5041.48 --> 5044.879999999999
consecutively happen

5045.92 --> 5049.84
they're not gonna stop that

5047.84 --> 5051.04
indoctrination nonsense is only gonna

5049.84 --> 5056.88
grow worse

5051.04 --> 5060.159
through media

5056.88 --> 5063.1990000000005
but the quality of it is not necessarily

5060.159 --> 5063.199
gonna get any better

5064.239 --> 5066.959999999999
just more

5068.32 --> 5071.84
that's what i'm seeing

5093.12 --> 5097.12
okay steaming travel yeah good point i

5095.12 --> 5113.84
don't know

5097.12 --> 5113.84
maybe this is another account

5116.56 --> 5126.080000000001
okay i get it okay on that case

5121.84 --> 5129.76
it is dr gonzo

5126.08 --> 5130.5599999999995
[ __ ] yourself talk to seeking star water

5129.76 --> 5134.2390000000005
when she comes

5130.56 --> 5134.2390000000005
actually back scumbag

5135.679 --> 5140.4
you're not welcome here you hear me

5137.28 --> 5144.08
scumbag i'll let you back in

5140.4 --> 5146.239
when i want it in the meantime

5144.08 --> 5148.5599999999995
go [ __ ] yourself and sit in a corner

5146.239 --> 5155.839999999999
scumbag

5148.56 --> 5155.84
don't try to sneak in here psychopath

5158.32 --> 5163.5199999999995
thank you for pointing that out i really

5160.32 --> 5166.32
appreciate that i i

5163.52 --> 5166.320000000001
it's just that

5167.28 --> 5170.4
i don't know things said were not bad

5170.08 --> 5174.0
like

5170.4 --> 5174.0
seeking star wars could have said that

5174.8 --> 5179.52
maybe he maybe was dr gunzer talking

5177.44 --> 5181.44
about his freaking grandparents maybe

5179.52 --> 5182.400000000001
his grandparents are actually in that

5181.44 --> 5184.32
position

5182.4 --> 5185.839999999999
and then maybe he will take my advice

5184.32 --> 5186.639
maybe it was all just a conjured

5185.84 --> 5191.04
[ __ ]

5186.639 --> 5193.52
everything he said was just freaking lie

5191.04 --> 5194.48
i don't know but i know he's banned now

5193.52 --> 5211.360000000001
can get the

5194.48 --> 5214.08
[ __ ] out you're not welcome here

5211.36 --> 5214.5599999999995
right because everything i said even

5214.08 --> 5217.28
though

5214.56 --> 5218.080000000001
he probably made up all kinds of [ __ ]

5217.28 --> 5221.36
about what

5218.08 --> 5223.92
he basically played out an act probably

5221.36 --> 5224.96
everything i said still stands though

5223.92 --> 5227.6
you know

5224.96 --> 5228.2390000000005
everything i said universally applies so

5227.6 --> 5231.4400000000005
even though

5228.239 --> 5234.879999999999
he made up a lie and then

5231.44 --> 5237.28
thought he could roll me into that act

5234.88 --> 5239.1990000000005
practically i don't really care because

5237.28 --> 5242.8
i'm just going to respond

5239.199 --> 5246.0
to what is presented and i'm always

5242.8 --> 5249.1990000000005
assuming because of just over the years

5246.0 --> 5253.84
always assuming that people can just

5249.199 --> 5257.12
unpredictably go out of their minds

5253.84 --> 5259.679
in chat or be fake people

5257.12 --> 5261.679
i don't care because i only care about

5259.679 --> 5263.6
what is said how it is said

5261.679 --> 5264.8
the feelings that slip through with it

5263.6 --> 5266.88
the context

5264.8 --> 5269.12
that's really the only thing i truly

5266.88 --> 5281.84
respond to

5269.12 --> 5281.84
consistency history

5334.84 --> 5337.84
what

5370.0 --> 5379.84
okay tara 306

5373.28 --> 5379.84
what are you talking about

5384.4 --> 5389.5199999999995
is that still like the indian scientists

5390.639 --> 5407.84
that you said a lot of them got sick and

5394.239 --> 5407.839999999999
died or something

5418.84 --> 5421.84
so

5451.92 --> 5455.92
okay all right derek

5456.0 --> 5459.84
just to clear it up that you're still

5457.44 --> 5462.638999999999
talking about that

5459.84 --> 5466.159000000001
that's fine i don't know anything about

5462.639 --> 5466.159000000001
it though except for what you said

5473.92 --> 5481.52
not iron 26 it's just one person

5477.76 --> 5485.76
just one kneeing little stalker

5481.52 --> 5485.76
psychopath has no life

5487.04 --> 5492.4
got in their head and now they have to

5490.56 --> 5495.6
rage about that

5492.4 --> 5496.638999999999
constantly because i'm not gonna stop

5495.6 --> 5498.4800000000005
this show

5496.639 --> 5500.08
and i'm not gonna stop talking about

5498.48 --> 5503.28
flat earth

5500.08 --> 5508.239
and i'm not gonna stop talking about

5503.28 --> 5511.84
the pandemic scam psychological warfare

5508.239 --> 5515.12
attack based on complete false stories

5511.84 --> 5517.360000000001
that is being unrolled on the world

5515.12 --> 5518.88
and about how the vaccine is not

5517.36 --> 5522.5599999999995
actually a vaccine and

5518.88 --> 5525.84
all of that all of it

5522.56 --> 5528.400000000001
i'm not gonna stop i'll die first

5525.84 --> 5528.400000000001
you hear me

5530.84 --> 5538.4800000000005
yeah you can't stop me

5534.639 --> 5539.52
you can't troll me do whatever the [ __ ]

5538.48 --> 5541.678999999999
you think you can do

5539.52 --> 5547.84
it's not gonna make me stop i'm never

5541.679 --> 5547.84
going to stop you understand

5561.679 --> 5567.679
what's the truth about vaccines well

5564.639 --> 5567.679
which vaccines

5570.08 --> 5574.96
vaccine is a vaccine now if it's not

5572.719 --> 5577.12
actually a vaccine

5574.96 --> 5579.76
but it's still named the vaccine and

5577.12 --> 5583.28
people refer to it as a vaccine

5579.76 --> 5587.04
then that's false advertisement

5583.28 --> 5590.4
right i don't even have to name

5587.04 --> 5595.28
names things can just

5590.4 --> 5595.28
describe that just that

5595.84 --> 5599.4400000000005
right who can censor that who can censor

5598.88 --> 5602.56
somebody

5599.44 --> 5604.5599999999995
saying that nothing can

5602.56 --> 5605.6
you could put that anywhere they can do

5604.56 --> 5607.6
nothing about it

5605.6 --> 5617.84
it's just a piece of information that

5607.6 --> 5617.84
applies always

5618.0 --> 5621.04
so what is a chrono vaccine it's not a

5619.84 --> 5624.08
vaccine

5621.04 --> 5624.08
it's gene therapy

5625.12 --> 5633.199
it doesn't cure anything

5630.0 --> 5634.08
there is no described process in which

5633.199 --> 5638.4
it can

5634.08 --> 5638.4
lead to the curing of this virtual

5642.84 --> 5645.84
disease

5649.679 --> 5652.4800000000005
to do what

5653.92 --> 5661.12
it's gene therapy to experiment

5657.52 --> 5661.120000000001
i don't know it depends on the type

5663.04 --> 5667.76
it from what i heard it alters a

5665.36 --> 5669.28
specific type of protein

5667.76 --> 5671.12
it has all kinds of negative

5669.28 --> 5674.48
consequences right

5671.12 --> 5677.44
so i'm not a genetic engineer

5674.48 --> 5679.12
expert but i've heard enough about it to

5677.44 --> 5682.4
know that it literally

5679.12 --> 5683.679
does not do anything against the flu the

5682.4 --> 5687.04
cold or what

5683.679 --> 5689.92
is called kovid it doesn't do

5687.04 --> 5691.6
anything about it everybody that's

5689.92 --> 5695.4400000000005
saying it cures it

5691.6 --> 5698.4800000000005
is a liar right

5695.44 --> 5702.5599999999995
should be held responsible

5698.48 --> 5703.36
for lying and false advertisement with

5702.56 --> 5707.679
potentially

5703.36 --> 5707.679
fatal consequences yeah

5708.4 --> 5711.679
that's a whole freaking lot of people by

5710.88 --> 5715.52
now

5711.679 --> 5718.0
a whole bunch of people

5715.52 --> 5718.0
a lot

5723.84 --> 5730.56
i guess i read violent no

5727.36 --> 5730.5599999999995
i don't know who that is

5731.119 --> 5734.719
maybe i've seen something come by i

5733.28 --> 5737.119
don't the

5734.719 --> 5738.2390000000005

5737.119 --> 5742.639
does sounds

5738.239 --> 5746.239
it does sound dutch

5742.639 --> 5749.04
but there's plenty of acti yeah uh

5746.239 --> 5752.239
activity here in the netherlands against

5749.04 --> 5752.239
the whole covet hoax

5752.719 --> 5757.6

5755.84 --> 5762.719
familiar

remarkable i don't know why is that

5788.48 --> 5791.199
remarkable

5793.119 --> 5796.4
you don't have to be sorry it's just

5794.719 --> 5799.28
that why are you assuming that i know

5796.4 --> 5813.839999999999
all these people

5799.28 --> 5813.84
i don't know a lot of people

5818.56 --> 5823.76

5844.719 --> 5848.4
bumped into that

5845.76 --> 5850.4800000000005
you know when at first like the last

5848.4 --> 5852.879999999999
year

5850.48 --> 5854.638999999999
i did a lot of digging out there with

5852.88 --> 5857.04
videos

5854.639 --> 5858.96
concerning kovit's situation and i might

5857.04 --> 5861.5199999999995
have bumped into him

5858.96 --> 5864.8
then i just don't freaking remember i

5861.52 --> 5864.8
don't remember the names

5865.36 --> 5868.639
it's just i don't have room in my head

5868.32 --> 5871.679
for

5868.639 --> 5871.679
all these details

5874.0 --> 5877.84
i'm just looking for a structure

5880.8 --> 5884.88
structural insight that's really the

5883.199 --> 5897.678999999999
thing that i remember

5884.88 --> 5901.6
the best

5897.679 --> 5904.4
oh god oh just look for it i guess

5901.6 --> 5905.679
i guess it's shameful i don't know it

5904.4 --> 5911.839999999999
whatever

5905.679 --> 5911.84
okay well let's see let's google him

5924.159 --> 5927.36
oh all right

5930.48 --> 5934.159
oh he's on hoax wiki

5934.4 --> 5939.839999999999
it's all kinds of garbage all right so

5940.96 --> 5946.32
yeah the supposed detrimental

5944.32 --> 5950.639
description

5946.32 --> 5954.48
pretty much tells me that he's yeah

5950.639 --> 5954.4800000000005
sounds like he he gets it

5957.6 --> 5967.84
i've never met him

5970.08 --> 5975.199
yes outlandish claims though why bring

5972.56 --> 5975.1990000000005
it up then

5979.679 --> 5986.639
why why are you bringing this person up

5982.88 --> 5986.639
why are you doing that el junkie

5987.04 --> 5995.84
and why are you expecting me to know him

5990.56 --> 5995.84
just because he's dutch

6014.96 --> 6020.159
okay fine dude look if this guy wants to

6018.719 --> 6022.4800000000005
have a conversation with me

6020.159 --> 6023.5199999999995
i highly doubt it since i'm a flat

6022.48 --> 6025.759999999999
earther

6023.52 --> 6027.4400000000005
and i i don't know any freaking dutch

6025.76 --> 6029.6
person okay in the netherlands that's

6027.44 --> 6031.919999999999
kind of into media

6029.6 --> 6034.8
and outspoken about anything that gets

6031.92 --> 6034.8
into flat earth

6034.84 --> 6040.2390000000005
right

6036.32 --> 6042.88
so but i'm open for a conversation dude

6040.239 --> 6043.678999999999
like i'll check him all out i just i'm

6042.88 --> 6047.04
not gonna be

6043.679 --> 6050.2390000000005
another one follower just reading

6047.04 --> 6052.639
his stuff from from the background

6050.239 --> 6054.638999999999
but better things to do if we have some

6052.639 --> 6057.76
outlandish theories i'll test them i'll

6054.639 --> 6057.76
test them right there

6059.119 --> 6063.599999999999
as i do instantly that's how i do it

6063.679 --> 6068.8
but there's a lot of just

6066.8 --> 6071.04
very blabbery people out here in the

6068.8 --> 6073.679
netherlands that are like conspiracy

6071.04 --> 6074.08
that are acting like conspiracy gurus

6073.679 --> 6079.119
they're

6074.08 --> 6082.96
literally acting like conspiracy gurus

6079.119 --> 6085.759999999999
just making story soup

6082.96 --> 6087.44
and it annoys me and often i think that

6085.76 --> 6090.08
it's like there's deliberate

6087.44 --> 6091.919999999999
dumbing down in it and i don't like that

6090.08 --> 6093.44
i don't know if this guy is one of those

6091.92 --> 6095.1990000000005
guys

6093.44 --> 6096.5599999999995
but i would not be surprised because

6095.199 --> 6100.638999999999
there's a lot of

6096.56 --> 6100.639
blabberers in the netherlands

6101.119 --> 6107.839999999999
that make conspiracy soup

6117.44 --> 6121.599999999999
oh he's anti-effie well who gives a [ __ ]

6120.56 --> 6135.84
then

6121.6 --> 6139.280000000001
