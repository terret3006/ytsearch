6.51 --> 40.169999999999995
[Music]

36.5 --> 43.71
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.17 --> 45.629000000000005
early-bird number 283 I'm your host

43.71 --> 47.25
Arwen and before I start the show please

45.629 --> 49.62
don't forget to share it on any platform

47.25 --> 51.3
you deem fit and also if you haven't

49.62 --> 52.919999999999995
already subscribed to my channel and hit

51.3 --> 54.54
the bell notification so you know when

52.92 --> 57.449
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

54.54 --> 59.339
p.m. amsterdam time every day also

57.449 --> 63.36
please do support me through the super

59.339 --> 66.479
chats but more importantly the paypal as

63.36 --> 68.63
long as it goes my patreon and my

66.479 --> 73.59
GoFundMe that would be much appreciated

68.63 --> 77.52
so today is hot or at least it's hot

73.59 --> 78.63000000000001
enough for me to not sit in a shirt it's

77.52 --> 80.789
hot in here

78.63 --> 82.83
like sitting out there it's pretty

80.789 --> 87.899
decent with a little breeze but it's

82.83 --> 92.49
just cooking here and yeah it would be a

87.899 --> 96.569
beautiful blue sky they haven't ruled

92.49 --> 100.77
the [ __ ] out of the place I haven't seen

96.569 --> 103.259
this level of cam trailing in a long

100.77 --> 105.99
time it's so bad

103.259 --> 110.869
they must have sprayed like hundreds of

105.99 --> 110.869
lines this morning hundreds of them and

112.849 --> 119.119
just kept on going and going and going

115.739 --> 123.78
and going it's terrible

119.119 --> 127.59
I'm not happy about that at all but I am

123.78 --> 130.08
gonna try to ignore it so let's see who

127.59 --> 132.36
was in Chad yeah not a lot of people yet

130.08 --> 134.31
I started up to hang out late I don't

132.36 --> 137.70000000000002
know where everybody's at this Friday

134.31 --> 140.43
morning anyway hello Fyodor Dostoevsky

137.7 --> 145.19
beyond practical examples Brent

140.43 --> 145.19
I'm Amanda young good to see you

148.36 --> 154.88000000000002
all right you're gonna do that again

151.36 --> 158.209
or are you gonna spam me with that stuff

154.88 --> 164.62
over and over again beyond practical

158.209 --> 164.62
example just tell me now

166.36 --> 174.17000000000002
anyway I I got some tea no coffee I got

172.069 --> 180.07999999999998
just one coffee pretty late

174.17 --> 181.51899999999998
I got some lemonade I got leftovers from

180.08 --> 186.19000000000003
yesterday mm-hmm

181.519 --> 189.92000000000002
I didn't eat the peach and I got did I

186.19 --> 192.29
know right the or this is not a peach

189.92 --> 196.069
the the other thing and I got some

192.29 --> 200.66
blueberry leftovers and even if Shane

196.069 --> 206.32999999999998
reach with delicious jam on it really

200.66 --> 208.84
good quality strawberry jam yeah that's

206.33 --> 208.84
pretty much it

218.77 --> 224.23000000000002
all right

220.37 --> 228.31900000000002
okay well let me just nectarine yet

224.23 --> 232.25
right oh it's just called nectarine in

228.319 --> 238.209
English as well okay alright didn't know

232.25 --> 240.94
that right so beyond practical examples

238.209 --> 246.019
alright you're already gonna do that I

240.94 --> 248.48
was gonna answer your question but it

246.019 --> 250.91
seems that you are the Matt you are here

248.48 --> 253.099
especially to get banned by our when I

250.91 --> 256.489
see this seems to be some kind of fetish

253.099 --> 259.25
with useless trolls that come here

256.489 --> 260.38899999999995
specifically to be banned because I

259.25 --> 262.94
don't know

260.389 --> 267.44
makes them feel special or something but

262.94 --> 269.57
yeah I can answer your your question for

267.44 --> 272.21
now can you tell me what evidence you

269.57 --> 275.93
have to support the claim that our

272.21 --> 277.15999999999997
atmosphere requires a container logic ok

275.93 --> 278.18
here the argument would be much

277.16 --> 283.34000000000003
appreciated

278.18 --> 288.55
are you using Boyle's law why would I

283.34 --> 293.81
necessarily need to use that for that

288.55 --> 297.28000000000003
it's just what evidence supports a claim

293.81 --> 303.08
of a container for the atmosphere well

297.28 --> 306.76
if there wasn't a container then there

303.08 --> 309.979
yeah gas pressure could never manifest

306.76 --> 315.229
it it would just look no container

309.979 --> 320.74
literally points to endless amounts of

315.229 --> 325.099
volume and since volume mass are

320.74 --> 328.25
connected in that sense if there is

325.099 --> 334.15999999999997
infinite volume yeah there simply won't

328.25 --> 338.93
be anything to to to cause this gas

334.16 --> 344.33000000000004
pressure doesn't work I don't know where

338.93 --> 347.539
the container is Pete from work I don't

344.33 --> 351.169
know but I know it's there because it

347.539 --> 354.099
has to be otherwise there wouldn't be

351.169 --> 354.099
this air pressure

355.87 --> 363.169
it has to be somewhere has to be some

359.72 --> 365.03000000000003
limited amount of volume must be so or

363.169 --> 369.34999999999997
they could never be this gas pressure

365.03 --> 372.02
unless the eliminate the amount of

369.35 --> 374.68
volume is potentially sort of unlimited

372.02 --> 378.79999999999995
insanely large and then the only

374.68 --> 380.93
consequence would be that it's all gonna

378.8 --> 386.63
be filled with gas one way or the other

380.93 --> 387.44
all of it or the most of it let's just

386.63 --> 391.75
say it like that

387.44 --> 396.919
there's not gonna be a vacuum anywhere

391.75 --> 403.849
and whatever the gradient would be as a

396.919 --> 405.94899999999996
result it yeah the the larger the volume

403.849 --> 408.71
the rougher the radiant get the gradient

405.949 --> 413.03000000000003
would get then of course there's also

408.71 --> 415.25
the dynamic influence of the Sun and its

413.03 --> 418.46
heat interaction the creation of gases

415.25 --> 421.13
and the cooling of descending and the

418.46 --> 423.729
turbulence and all that that makes it a

421.13 --> 425.99
little bit more complicated but that

423.729 --> 429.74
dynamic system is not gonna be

425.99 --> 434.38
sufficient to create this thick air

429.74 --> 438.889
pressure over here while billions of

434.38 --> 442.699
miles away there would be next to

438.889 --> 446.479
nothing that can't happen just can't

442.699 --> 449.27000000000004
it's impossible gradients can't work

446.479 --> 453.43
that way gradient is linear in nature

449.27 --> 461.29999999999995
always is always you can't prove

453.43 --> 463.34000000000003
nonlinear gradients doesn't work if you

461.3 --> 465.139
start the miniature demonstrated and

463.34 --> 468.85999999999996
I've already said like yeah you can have

465.139 --> 471.74
a gradient within a smaller container as

468.86 --> 475.15000000000003
well it just introduced different types

471.74 --> 478.69
of gases with different densities and

475.15 --> 481.279
then they will settle in their

478.69 --> 482.669
equilibrium point in relation to one

481.279 --> 488.099
another within that context

482.669 --> 488.849
eventually so yeah that answers that

488.099 --> 492.81
question

488.849 --> 495.27
and now you're gonna have to stop

492.81 --> 497.31
spamming that [ __ ] over and over

495.27 --> 501.29999999999995
again because the next time I hear that

497.31 --> 504.56
question without giving recognition to

501.3 --> 526.44
what I just explained that means banned

504.56 --> 531.779
okay right all right yeah I have by the

526.44 --> 534.57
way I not feeling all that great i I had

531.779 --> 539.43
a little wine accident yesterday evening

534.57 --> 541.1700000000001
in the sense that yeah I started

539.43 --> 544.079
drinking it and then I kind of lost

541.17 --> 549.54
control it was annoying I got caught up

544.079 --> 552.54
it's all Jose's fault not it but I got

549.54 --> 554.67
over at Jose's at some point because I

552.54 --> 558.66
just yeah there was no life debates and

554.67 --> 560.55
I wanted to interact I wanted to have a

558.66 --> 562.89
little challenge this I felt like it so

560.55 --> 564.68
I went there and was pretty cool got

562.89 --> 569.76
talked over a lot but I managed to

564.68 --> 572.67
literally get the other ballers just

569.76 --> 575.9399999999999
curious as to what I'm thinking about

572.67 --> 577.769
what I am modeling and so it's good when

575.94 --> 582.24
real honest technical honesty is

577.769 --> 584.339
appreciated but as I went on I did drink

582.24 --> 588.3290000000001
a little wine and then a little more and

584.339 --> 591.0290000000001
the more I shouldn't have because some

588.329 --> 593.43
point at two o'clock I just woke up and

591.029 --> 599.22
noticed whoa my dinner is just sitting

593.43 --> 603.029
there cold here um on the desktop here

599.22 --> 609.36
and yeah my entire day was just

603.029 --> 612.0
completely disjunct it disjointed

609.36 --> 614.67
because of that barely ate and now this

612.0 --> 618.88
morning I kind of felt sick

614.67 --> 621.9399999999999
not really violently sick but it did

618.88 --> 627.09
feel like okay that's that was just bad

621.94 --> 629.58
there was a complete waste and I think

627.09 --> 632.77
[Music]

629.58 --> 634.6
I'm almost not looking forward to D&D

632.77 --> 637.03
night this night because I'm probably

634.6 --> 640.09
gonna get some beers handed although

637.03 --> 642.6999999999999
beer may simply not it was look it's

640.09 --> 644.26
been wine for the first time since long

642.7 --> 646.33
I've been drinking beer barely had any

644.26 --> 650.62
problems with it except for that one bad

646.33 --> 653.71
beer so I'm just gonna leave the wine

650.62 --> 658.84
maybe forever it's just not working out

653.71 --> 664.0
for me it's just not it isn't yeah even

658.84 --> 667.4200000000001
if it is a good organic wine but yeah

664.0 --> 670.21
yeah Amanda young as I was on Jose's the

667.42 --> 672.16
thing was I got kind of caught up in the

670.21 --> 675.22
conversation everything and then I just

672.16 --> 678.3399999999999
started taking wine without thinking

675.22 --> 680.5600000000001
about it I got kind of in an inner in a

678.34 --> 683.2900000000001
rush with it and that's just that's was

680.56 --> 685.0899999999999
the big mistake because I didn't pay

683.29 --> 688.7199999999999
attention to how much I was actually

685.09 --> 691.09
taking and then at some point I just got

688.72 --> 697.23
really tired and basically laid on the

691.09 --> 697.23
bed and immediately blacked out that's

705.33 --> 710.47
yeah well I am looking forward to the

708.01 --> 713.08
evening because there's just a lot in

710.47 --> 715.9
the middle of working last session we

713.08 --> 720.64
played I literally lit the fuse on a

715.9 --> 723.9399999999999
huge landscape changing bomb pretty much

720.64 --> 728.47
a curse was finally getting fulfilled

723.94 --> 731.71
and energies are released Wars have

728.47 --> 733.8100000000001
suddenly broken out and there's gonna be

731.71 --> 735.5500000000001
chaos everywhere and it's kind of like

733.81 --> 737.29
okay players what are you gonna do the

735.55 --> 739.75
first thing I'm gonna confront them with

737.29 --> 741.8499999999999
of course is the dam breaking and how

739.75 --> 744.24
are they gonna save the town cuz

741.85 --> 747.5500000000001
everybody's just standing around and

744.24 --> 749.17
then it's gonna be a matter of okay what

747.55 --> 754.3
what is going on in the world

749.17 --> 757.5699999999999
well the Dwarven empire hammers landing

754.3 --> 760.7199999999999
is getting seriously attacked from

757.57 --> 763.7800000000001
underground and it's they'll find out

760.72 --> 767.35
it's not going well and the emperor has

763.78 --> 772.6
disappeared it's also a thing that I've

767.35 --> 774.4
planted the seed four years ago so this

772.6 --> 776.8000000000001
is the moment when suddenly all these

774.4 --> 783.22
pieces that have pretty much been

776.8 --> 784.9
gathering yeah in the in the back of my

783.22 --> 787.57
mind over what was going to happen

784.9 --> 791.35
they're now just gonna unfold piece by

787.57 --> 794.1400000000001
piece and I'm gonna see how my players

791.35 --> 796.1800000000001
are gonna go through that how if they're

794.14 --> 799.09
gonna let things change their character

796.18 --> 801.4499999999999
for example or if they're gonna try to

799.09 --> 804.22
power play the [ __ ] out of it and just

801.45 --> 808.24
restore everything completely which

804.22 --> 810.73
would pretty much break a lot or if they

808.24 --> 813.34
or if maybe they don't think they can

810.73 --> 815.98
they probably could I'm not gonna tell

813.34 --> 819.3100000000001
them they probably could don't want to

815.98 --> 821.9200000000001
do that again anyway I am excited about

819.31 --> 825.13
that but I kind of missed preparation

821.92 --> 829.06
time because of the freaking wine

825.13 --> 832.78
because I actually wanted to work on

829.06 --> 836.7099999999999
maps like playing maps with a grid that

832.78 --> 837.73
I could then use for the battles really

836.71 --> 847.359
quickly

837.73 --> 853.149
I'm gonna have to improvise again yes

847.359 --> 858.3090000000001
so yeah wine it's not good not if you

853.149 --> 864.879
don't if you don't limit it and I should

858.309 --> 867.249
have I don't know with me it's it it's

864.879 --> 869.399
hard to get it under control it has been

867.249 --> 872.47
pretty tough with cannabis although

869.399 --> 873.279
finally it seems like I got it under

872.47 --> 875.98
control

873.279 --> 880.299
I'm not using as much as I have been and

875.98 --> 882.189
it it helps a lot that I have a better

880.299 --> 884.529
under control but now yeah

882.189 --> 887.199
with beers it's pretty easy to deal with

884.529 --> 889.749
because I just buy a limited amount of

887.199 --> 891.6089999999999
beers that I know that's how much I can

889.749 --> 894.1890000000001
take and if I would take more I'd get

891.609 --> 898.239
sick I'm not gonna stock up on like

894.189 --> 900.79
giant crate of beers because then yeah

898.239 --> 902.9490000000001
I'm gonna get in trouble I know this so

900.79 --> 907.66
with beer I never have this problem what

902.949 --> 912.2199999999999
yeah with wine it's it's people when I

907.66 --> 914.649
buy it / - in the Eco Plaza but yeah

912.22 --> 916.8090000000001
that gives me the risk that I might

914.649 --> 918.699
actually drink more than one bottle at a

916.809 --> 923.379
time which is bad I shouldn't even drink

918.699 --> 925.7489999999999
a whole bottle of it magnesium helps

923.379 --> 930.039
getting rid of all go hangover okay

925.749 --> 933.899
thanks that probably would work just

930.039 --> 937.869
getting a lot of drink having a shower

933.899 --> 941.859
taking a walk outside in the in the

937.869 --> 949.539
forest over here I did all that that

941.859 --> 953.6790000000001
also helps a lot and me just eating

949.539 --> 955.239
healthy drinking tea getting some fruits

953.679 --> 958.0889999999999
and all of that helps oh yeah and I've

955.239 --> 959.5
got a lovely glass of orange juice also

958.089 --> 965.1700000000001
I

959.5 --> 969.04
they'll head it so I'll be alright I'm

965.17 --> 970.81
pretty sure that by the time like in

969.04 --> 973.27
probably an hour or two I'll be

970.81 --> 978.67
perfectly fine or maybe halfway to hang

973.27 --> 980.23
out I'll be just fine right Trish bliss

978.67 --> 988.39
yeah if you don't miss alcohol then

980.23 --> 990.34
don't use it but yeah to be fair I do

988.39 --> 998.43
have a lot of fun with alcohol when

990.34 --> 1001.98
things don't get out of control right

998.43 --> 1006.15
thank thanks for all the tips people but

1001.98 --> 1008.4300000000001
I technically don't have that kind of

1006.15 --> 1011.1
hangover it's not like it's still

1008.43 --> 1013.4699999999999
spinning a couple of hours ago it was

1011.1 --> 1015.75
when I was sitting in the woods

1013.47 --> 1018.72
it wasn't literally spinning but then I

1015.75 --> 1021.99
was like trying to focus on looking at

1018.72 --> 1024.6000000000001
the chemtrails in the sky and it had

1021.99 --> 1027.15
real trouble getting my eyes focused so

1024.6 --> 1029.8799999999999
I knew it was like oh I think my nervous

1027.15 --> 1032.88
system is has been punished by the

1029.88 --> 1034.949
alcohol I could still think but it's

1032.88 --> 1037.8600000000001
just all weakened down a little

1034.949 --> 1047.63
temporarily and it's already most of us

1037.86 --> 1047.6299999999999
go away so 22 years it's amazing

1052.98 --> 1059.049
well I rarely have actual hangovers

1057.19 --> 1062.6100000000001
because this kind of thing doesn't

1059.049 --> 1065.86
happen that often and it's funny because

1062.61 --> 1068.9189999999999
earlier I've already said like yeah

1065.86 --> 1071.32
phases of alcohol then usually I get a

1068.919 --> 1073.2990000000002
sign I have to stop and that sign is

1071.32 --> 1075.8999999999999
usually that things go wrong and I get

1073.299 --> 1079.059
really sick of it and then literally

1075.9 --> 1083.02
don't want to do that anymore because of

1079.059 --> 1088.72
the sick feeling of it it ruins the the

1083.02 --> 1093.029
fun and that way then I step away and

1088.72 --> 1093.029
stop doing it on daily basis

1096.74 --> 1100.539
Hey hello Karen be

1105.1 --> 1108.1
okay

1115.29 --> 1124.0
alcoholic really I'm an alcoholic

1119.5 --> 1128.37
because I I have times that can last

1124.0 --> 1130.36
months where I drink for the six beers

1128.37 --> 1133.06
in the evening

1130.36 --> 1136.6
oh my god I'm such an alcoholic I get

1133.06 --> 1140.02
quickly meat to go to a doctor or may

1136.6 --> 1141.07
I'm a risk liver failure or a delirium

1140.02 --> 1157.51
right

1141.07 --> 1166.09
four to six beers mm-hmm oh wow Amanda

1157.51 --> 1168.25
you mmm ten years is a long time I'm AB

1166.09 --> 1173.34
longest period I had where I quit

1168.25 --> 1173.34
cannabis tirely was

1181.02 --> 1189.59
yeah I think eight years I eight years I

1184.95 --> 1194.64
didn't smoke cannabis and I've had a

1189.59 --> 1196.4099999999999
five-year stop in tobacco as well but

1194.64 --> 1201.15
unfortunately I was dumb enough to start

1196.41 --> 1206.97
it up again but anyway I don't smoke

1201.15 --> 1210.69
separately anyway alright yep Amanda you

1206.97 --> 1212.9
know I I hear ya it can make you

1210.69 --> 1212.9
paranoid

1213.29 --> 1219.54
there's a trick of dealing with that but

1217.17 --> 1222.0900000000001
also just depends on how sensitive you

1219.54 --> 1224.309
are and how you respond to it some

1222.09 --> 1228.809
people get more paranoid by it and it

1224.309 --> 1231.66
doesn't really go away so and those

1228.809 --> 1233.37
people I don't know most of them never

1231.66 --> 1235.41
even start because they just get that

1233.37 --> 1237.51
one first bad experience and then this

1235.41 --> 1239.64
thing's like yeah not doing that anymore

1237.51 --> 1245.79
I think my brother was one of those

1239.64 --> 1249.8090000000002
people all right well maybe not everyone

1245.79 --> 1254.22
has it I have the moments where usually

1249.809 --> 1257.16
lasts 15 minutes but it doesn't always

1254.22 --> 1259.71
you know I don't usually when I'm really

1257.16 --> 1264.1200000000001
focused on about to do something getting

1259.71 --> 1268.52
my mind into a certain frame to do

1264.12 --> 1268.52
something then I don't get that

1272.0 --> 1275.0
yeah

1282.46 --> 1290.16
miss understanding of Boyle's law really

1293.64 --> 1297.3400000000001
Wow

1295.03 --> 1302.71
the Wizards built something new it seems

1297.34 --> 1307.3899999999999
they're really there they're building

1302.71 --> 1310.69
new [ __ ] I think I think that the globe

1307.39 --> 1313.0590000000002
religious fanatics and their controllers

1310.69 --> 1316.41
that helped fool them with their

1313.059 --> 1320.62
machinations that the religious fanatics

1316.41 --> 1323.71
wholeheartedly embrace being fooled they

1320.62 --> 1325.4499999999998
want that in their hearts I think

1323.71 --> 1328.39
they're building new [ __ ] they're trying

1325.45 --> 1333.91
to reroute the actual scientific based

1328.39 --> 1337.1200000000001
knowledge to try to undo the arguments

1333.91 --> 1339.8400000000001
literally cutting in their own

1337.12 --> 1342.34
foundations it's pretty amazing

1339.84 --> 1344.62
or maybe this is just a really sad

1342.34 --> 1346.74
attempt to distract and Gaslight I don't

1344.62 --> 1351.75
know what it is

1346.74 --> 1351.75
miss understand Boyle's law

1353.87 --> 1356.9899999999998
[Music]

1378.94 --> 1388.8400000000001
pressure is inversely proportional to

1382.57 --> 1395.74
the volume right volume yeah how is this

1388.84 --> 1398.59
a misunderstanding I even used the very

1395.74 --> 1405.22
technical words that are used here to

1398.59 --> 1407.7099999999998
describe it it's just you know that's

1405.22 --> 1411.16
the funny thing about it once you really

1407.71 --> 1414.07
really start to understand all the

1411.16 --> 1417.7
scientific stuff the frameworks the

1414.07 --> 1422.1699999999998
concepts the models the history of where

1417.7 --> 1424.78
the words coming from then you don't

1422.17 --> 1427.99
even need to look up stuff anymore I can

1424.78 --> 1431.6499999999999
I just understand it and I use the right

1427.99 --> 1436.27
words and it matches up it always works

1431.65 --> 1440.8500000000001
out because it's right because I

1436.27 --> 1444.82
followed my intuition and my integrity

1440.85 --> 1446.73
very careful I'm starting to distinguish

1444.82 --> 1453.1599999999999
between what you can typically find

1446.73 --> 1455.31
within science and I just get it and

1453.16 --> 1459.3300000000002
it's funny that when I look up new stuff

1455.31 --> 1460.62
just it's basically describes what I'm

1459.33 --> 1465.1799999999998
talking about

1460.62 --> 1465.1799999999998
partially and it's always cool to see

1477.3 --> 1486.3
right what what are you nuts

1481.8 --> 1491.3999999999999
are you literally trying to break your

1486.3 --> 1495.6
own mind here is this like chemo virus

1491.4 --> 1497.19
version - Nathan eight welcome you look

1495.6 --> 1504.3
at this and Chad look at practical

1497.19 --> 1507.27
example he says this occurs by me we

1504.3 --> 1510.32
people that have brains ignoring the

1507.27 --> 1512.91
starting gas that has a pressure already

1510.32 --> 1515.78
yeah that's right because you know why

1512.91 --> 1521.52
it has that because it's in a container

1515.78 --> 1524.19
it it's always there are you reading

1521.52 --> 1529.11
what you're saying or are you literally

1524.19 --> 1531.9
trying to break reality just break it

1529.11 --> 1534.4199999999998
apart throw it away start all over again

1531.9 --> 1536.4
you know the Marxist way are you

1534.42 --> 1538.26
literally just trying to break your own

1536.4 --> 1541.02
mind there this is just insane

1538.26 --> 1543.42
why do you think there is gas pressure

1541.02 --> 1546.92
already before you start doing stuff

1543.42 --> 1551.46
with it because it's in the container

1546.92 --> 1557.49
and that container is the realm that we

1551.46 --> 1560.31
know that is here and we can't test it

1557.49 --> 1563.16
without it because in order to do that

1560.31 --> 1565.2
you'd have to escape this realm or

1563.16 --> 1567.66
container so I wish you the best of luck

1565.2 --> 1570.21
with that and of course you can imagine

1567.66 --> 1572.72
that that should be possible that you

1570.21 --> 1578.39
could go outside of the atmosphere and

1572.72 --> 1583.98
escape gravity and yeah go do that bye

1578.39 --> 1589.16
go ahead you know but I'm just gonna go

1583.98 --> 1592.04
by actual physical reality and not my

1589.16 --> 1597.45
fantasy of what might be possible

1592.04 --> 1599.6399999999999
somehow some way that you refuse to give

1597.45 --> 1603.63
up because you just loved the idea of

1599.64 --> 1606.8000000000002
the possibility so much I'm just gonna

1603.63 --> 1606.8000000000002
go with reality here

1609.16 --> 1616.7900000000002
okay my point is not falsifiable yeah no

1614.0 --> 1618.74
[ __ ] it's not falsifiable are you gonna

1616.79 --> 1622.1299999999999
take away the container are you gonna

1618.74 --> 1626.93
open up this realm to prove that it is

1622.13 --> 1630.5900000000001
closed what art you know what practical

1626.93 --> 1634.46
example I bet you can scientifically

1630.59 --> 1637.52
prove your you're alive Kenya you know

1634.46 --> 1639.8
why because in order to do that you'd

1637.52 --> 1643.61
have to manipulate that as an

1639.8 --> 1646.82
independent variable so maybe you should

1643.61 --> 1652.28
dedicate some time to proving to me that

1646.82 --> 1654.11
you're actually alive and you're

1652.28 --> 1656.8999999999999
probably even too dumb to realize what I

1654.11 --> 1664.2199999999998
just told you but yeah I think you

1656.9 --> 1668.5900000000001
should you know because I need

1664.22 --> 1668.59
scientific proof that you are alive

1668.91 --> 1675.64
[Music]

1678.58 --> 1689.99
so anyway I think I finally broke them

1682.1 --> 1692.6
as they should be so yeah boys love

1689.99 --> 1698.419
definitely no misunderstanding about

1692.6 --> 1701.4499999999998
that definitely not but to be fair I

1698.419 --> 1703.7
think that Boyle's law must be kind of

1701.45 --> 1706.6100000000001
like a like a boil

1703.7 --> 1710.179
on the body of science it really hurts

1706.61 --> 1714.6499999999999
it stands out it's like ah why can't we

1710.179 --> 1716.0
get rid of this yeah that they want to

1714.65 --> 1718.789
get rid of the boil they want to

1716.0 --> 1721.4
surgically remove that boil from the

1718.789 --> 1724.51
body of science but you can't do it you

1721.4 --> 1728.48
can just try to ignore it it's not there

1724.51 --> 1732.07
it's wrong it's misunderstood oh don't

1728.48 --> 1732.07
look at it don't look at Boyle's law

1748.64 --> 1755.75
yeah goodbye I gave you all the answers

1752.75 --> 1756.65
you need and you're just being a whiny

1755.75 --> 1760.21
[ __ ] now

1756.65 --> 1760.21
so get the [ __ ] out

1777.12 --> 1779.8999999999999
in there

1790.009 --> 1800.34
anyway good riddance his questions got

1797.46 --> 1802.999
recorded and answered he's obviously not

1800.34 --> 1806.879
gonna do anything with it but just wine

1802.999 --> 1810.119
try to distract [ __ ] so that's why I ban

1806.879 --> 1812.119
him because I of course I could've

1810.119 --> 1818.6
banned him right from the start but now

1812.119 --> 1821.97
his retardation and you go this hood spa

1818.6 --> 1825.869
allowed me to just spend some time in

1821.97 --> 1831.019
the show um um yeah explaining something

1825.869 --> 1832.2289999999998
so that way I don't know yeah you know

1831.019 --> 1835.559
[ __ ]

1832.229 --> 1838.559
maybe [ __ ] but even [ __ ] has its uses

1835.559 --> 1840.9289999999999
when you put it in the ground you might

1838.559 --> 1842.1589999999999
be able to grow something with it so

1840.929 --> 1849.8990000000001
that's what I did

1842.159 --> 1853.7890000000002
so let the turret sit there and then dug

1849.899 --> 1853.789
a hole shoved it in the ground

1862.909 --> 1870.3490000000002
alright well no no cept a PE know what I

1866.609 --> 1876.299
am NOT even gonna gonna go to the beach

1870.349 --> 1878.639
like ever until I have my p900 I'm not

1876.299 --> 1884.759
gonna go there I don't want to go to the

1878.639 --> 1887.1899999999998
beach until I have a p900 because

1884.759 --> 1887.6390000000001
otherwise I'd be there like oh yeah the

1887.19 --> 1890.46
beach

1887.639 --> 1894.2389999999998
oh nice being at the beach I went out of

1890.46 --> 1897.72
my way to go to the beach probably spend

1894.239 --> 1901.409
money on traveling and all that to just

1897.72 --> 1904.019
look at it man smell the sea and not

1901.409 --> 1906.96
being able to study that horizon that I

1904.019 --> 1908.789
wanted to do so much so if you really

1906.96 --> 1911.22
want me to go to the beach then please

1908.789 --> 1916.229
help me out by donating to my GoFundMe

1911.22 --> 1919.56
to get the p900 I I transformed the site

1916.229 --> 1922.77
a little just tad

1919.56 --> 1927.57
to change it back to a p900 because the

1922.77 --> 1931.97
p1000 just not it's not useful you know

1927.57 --> 1931.97
it's too big I don't need that

1932.81 --> 1941.85
and I'll yeah p900 should be a lot

1936.06 --> 1944.8799999999999
cheaper and then I can use yeah I can

1941.85 --> 1949.35
still get the status and all the extras

1944.88 --> 1951.5100000000002
that I could potentially need and yeah

1949.35 --> 1954.4499999999998
do some good good footage with that I

1951.51 --> 1956.52
can't wait but yeah for the beach one I

1954.45 --> 1959.16
yeah definitely not going there without

1956.52 --> 1963.3899999999999
some kind of camera not going to do it

1959.16 --> 1967.22
oh by the way thank you Giulio Pavan for

1963.39 --> 1967.22
the $10 Supachai donation

1974.12 --> 1980.539
right that's right

1977.51 --> 1983.51
Julie Julie open thank you pressure

1980.539 --> 1986.48
needing a container is one of the most

1983.51 --> 1990.3799999999999
strong one of the strongest points I

1986.48 --> 1995.179
mean for the flat earth therefore they

1990.38 --> 1997.3090000000002
are cranking the deception up no one can

1995.179 --> 2001.0900000000001
get rid of the container it is always

1997.309 --> 2003.73
needed all right so they just ignore it

2001.09 --> 2007.84
like Boyle's law it's like this this

2003.73 --> 2009.94
hideous to them it's a hideous law stuck

2007.84 --> 2012.309
to their arm right it for everyone to

2009.94 --> 2015.19
see on that body of science and they

2012.309 --> 2018.37
just they just try to ignore it or work

2015.19 --> 2022.299
around it or make people confused about

2018.37 --> 2024.37
it so they don't look it's there it's

2022.299 --> 2027.039
part of the body of science it's in

2024.37 --> 2030.51
there but they don't want it to be in

2027.039 --> 2030.51
there they just can't get rid of it

2045.79 --> 2048.75
talking

2054.03 --> 2059.07
Oh spare room music why do people think

2057.06 --> 2062.04
Flat Earth has to be hidden and all this

2059.07 --> 2069.75
deception for what reason well because

2062.04 --> 2073.46
their their exploits the dream has a lot

2069.75 --> 2076.23
of functions exploitation functions

2073.46 --> 2078.9900000000002
trickery you can do to make a lot of

2076.23 --> 2082.649
people very enthusiastic very dreamy and

2078.99 --> 2085.6789999999996
they will put down big money for it

2082.649 --> 2089.97
they'll categorize it for themselves as

2085.679 --> 2092.01
a special goal it's very important it's

2089.97 --> 2095.4289999999996
worth putting down that money for and

2092.01 --> 2098.73
that's why they don't want flat earth

2095.429 --> 2100.77
because Flat Earth focuses on proving

2098.73 --> 2105.21
that it's all [ __ ] that it's all

2100.77 --> 2107.19
dream a giant dream a bunch of lies

2105.21 --> 2110.88
stitching it all together and a lot of

2107.19 --> 2114.21
fast talkers that just have become

2110.88 --> 2117.15
experts at trying to sound smart for

2114.21 --> 2119.01
people that are not actually smart but

2117.15 --> 2120.9
they will believe that they are smart

2119.01 --> 2123.2700000000004
because they sound smart they talk like

2120.9 --> 2125.52
they are smart to them it's a trick it's

2123.27 --> 2130.17
a training train to do that and that

2125.52 --> 2132.2
training is publicly available they look

2130.17 --> 2134.76
it off from other people doing that and

2132.2 --> 2137.91
then they start doing it themselves

2134.76 --> 2140.7900000000004
that's how that that mindset that way of

2137.91 --> 2142.44
talking has come into being through the

2140.79 --> 2144.69
universities and all that they just look

2142.44 --> 2147.83
at off from know some person doing it I

2144.69 --> 2150.15
think oh man he explained that so cool

2147.83 --> 2151.92
everybody loved it I'm gonna do it like

2150.15 --> 2153.96
that and that's how it works that's

2151.92 --> 2156.36
where these all these rumpus isn't not

2153.96 --> 2158.34
everyone get comes from there are a

2156.36 --> 2160.71
whole bunch of tricksters and they just

2158.34 --> 2164.19
learned from their teachers about the

2160.71 --> 2166.32
trickery of explanation instead of just

2164.19 --> 2169.41
focusing on what is real and what is

2166.32 --> 2171.3300000000004
[ __ ] because as soon as they started

2169.41 --> 2173.67
questioning that it became very apparent

2171.33 --> 2178.08
if you're gonna go here you're not gonna

2173.67 --> 2182.919
get those fancy pants so yeah then they

2178.08 --> 2187.069
can dig dig they can't be taken

2182.919 --> 2188.8689999999997
they can't just imagine sacrificing

2187.069 --> 2191.859
their fancy pants so they will

2188.869 --> 2196.3900000000003
absolutely go with the delusion and

2191.859 --> 2196.39
that's how that all goes

2200.65 --> 2206.9
yes Gideon's sick I do know where that

2203.299 --> 2210.219
is not specifically but I could look it

2206.9 --> 2210.219
up I know it's a Dutch place

2232.28 --> 2235.28
telescope

2243.96 --> 2252.2200000000003
all right yeah David read it was just a

2249.03 --> 2254.26
funny coincident I thought it was kind

2252.22 --> 2258.58
of funny I don't know maybe this is just

2254.26 --> 2260.98
nerd humor you know we always talk about

2258.58 --> 2263.109
the body of science which is like all

2260.98 --> 2265.51
this knowledge and all these scientific

2263.109 --> 2268.6
experiments supposedly stitched together

2265.51 --> 2271.63
and then the Boyle's law comes up and

2268.6 --> 2273.8199999999997
it's in the way they hate it so it's

2271.63 --> 2276.09
literally it's so ironic that it's

2273.82 --> 2279.369
called Boyle's law it's just perfect

2276.09 --> 2283.29
it's a joke that had to be made by the

2279.369 --> 2283.29
by me because I saw it first

2298.92 --> 2305.56
yeah that's also true attrition if

2302.4 --> 2308.2000000000003
there's another reason for the dream to

2305.56 --> 2311.08
be upheld the giant budgets and all that

2308.2 --> 2315.93
to keep it going to make it the state's

2311.08 --> 2324.04
belief as it were so much more reasons

2315.93 --> 2326.83
because it is also a good option to to

2324.04 --> 2331.06
manipulate the economy if necessary

2326.83 --> 2335.11
because they can just Ram people into

2331.06 --> 2337.72
employment for this nonsense and they

2335.11 --> 2339.94
will be registered as employed and there

2337.72 --> 2342.0099999999998
will be a common economy because there

2339.94 --> 2344.5
is money rolling there is stuff being

2342.01 --> 2349.1800000000003
built it doesn't matter to the economy

2344.5 --> 2351.1
that resources are being wasted what

2349.18 --> 2354.46
really matters is that stuff is being

2351.1 --> 2356.92
done that is what registers so NASA can

2354.46 --> 2359.4700000000003
be easily used to manipulate the economy

2356.92 --> 2361.63
just insert a huge amount of jobs and

2359.47 --> 2364.1699999999996
suddenly there is a huge amount of jobs

2361.63 --> 2367.06
even if everything else is breaking down

2364.17 --> 2370.8
it's an option it's a thing they can do

2367.06 --> 2374.04
with it it works they've done this

2370.8 --> 2374.04
absolutely they have

2376.75 --> 2382.99
just make jobs and the people that are

2381.28 --> 2384.6090000000004
gonna be employed with these jobs are

2382.99 --> 2387.2799999999997
gonna love it it's like oh my god a

2384.609 --> 2389.59
dream job I'm working for an awesome so

2387.28 --> 2392.349
yeah it's not gonna be jobs like oh no

2389.59 --> 2396.01
not this again we don't want to do this

2392.349 --> 2398.1090000000004
like Amazon workers you know did nobody

2396.01 --> 2401.0200000000004
wants to do that but hey if you heard oh

2398.109 --> 2404.02
my god NASA is working on this and this

2401.02 --> 2405.7599999999998
and they need smart people well the

2404.02 --> 2408.9
lines are gonna be filled to get that

2405.76 --> 2411.849
job so it's very effective economy

2408.9 --> 2417.1600000000003
boosting system if they want it to be

2411.849 --> 2419.5
it'll register it'll give yeah it'll

2417.16 --> 2426.67
work and it does work that's why they

2419.5 --> 2432.43
keep on pulling it back back in you do

2426.67 --> 2435.599
get it right that's really a thing think

2432.43 --> 2439.2999999999997
about how many people you've come across

2435.599 --> 2442.75
that have in some way been employed for

2439.3 --> 2447.6600000000003
NASA or built on something that we're

2442.75 --> 2450.4
not proud as [ __ ] of it okay none I

2447.66 --> 2453.31
think that even the people that probably

2450.4 --> 2455.17
have done that and that then would later

2453.31 --> 2457.66
figure out that it might actually all be

2455.17 --> 2461.05
nonsense they'd still be kind of proud

2457.66 --> 2463.7799999999997
of it because it was still interesting

2461.05 --> 2466.78
to do and yeah especially people like

2463.78 --> 2469.8100000000004
engineers that built this robot thing is

2466.78 --> 2473.02
controls and all that that still real

2469.81 --> 2477.4
technology's real skills they gained as

2473.02 --> 2479.7
they were doing it but it was all for a

2477.4 --> 2479.7000000000003
dream

2482.77 --> 2485.77
see

2490.619 --> 2496.54
Zep tepi I don't know if I'd ever get to

2494.53 --> 2500.17
meet an astronaut I wouldn't want to

2496.54 --> 2503.2599999999998
address them publicly I did I I don't

2500.17 --> 2506.7400000000002
want to do that it it'd be mean it's

2503.26 --> 2510.3390000000004
like yeah I could poke you I could ask

2506.74 --> 2514.0589999999997
you very tough questions that seem very

2510.339 --> 2516.2799999999997
easy and just put you on the spot make

2514.059 --> 2518.53
you sweat for the lies that you've been

2516.28 --> 2520.96
forced to uphold for so long for your

2518.53 --> 2525.1600000000003
fancy pants and lollipops but it just

2520.96 --> 2527.859
seemed cruel I I don't know but I'd be

2525.16 --> 2531.339
very interested to talk to an astronaut

2527.859 --> 2533.619
behind the scenes just see if I can get

2531.339 --> 2536.44
a real honest conversation going under

2533.619 --> 2539.65
the premise like yeah okay what we talk

2536.44 --> 2544.569
about here is off the record and I'm

2539.65 --> 2548.23
just not gonna officially say what your

2544.569 --> 2549.54
opinions are I'm just yeah I would hide

2548.23 --> 2552.819
their identity but I'd be very

2549.54 --> 2560.92
interested to actually talk to people

2552.819 --> 2564.2799999999997
that are officially astronauts but I'd

2560.92 --> 2569.17
never believe them I'm pretty sure that

2564.28 --> 2573.19
I have earlier in my life met astronauts

2569.17 --> 2576.13
through school and I was a space

2573.19 --> 2578.829
enthusiasts also so we looked up these

2576.13 --> 2582.579
places like oh space the planetarium I

2578.829 --> 2585.3900000000003
love that [ __ ] and I think that through

2582.579 --> 2588.6090000000004
that way I also bumped into an astronaut

2585.39 --> 2591.6299999999997
one time I don't know I was very little

2588.609 --> 2591.63
when that all happened

2622.77 --> 2626.48
don't do that Jason

2634.619 --> 2642.15
just I'd like to put Jason on the spot

2638.13 --> 2645.3900000000003
because I'm you know he's always nice

2642.15 --> 2649.4990000000003
and everything but as far as your actual

2645.39 --> 2651.66
arguments go for your concave system

2649.499 --> 2656.7
you've never addressed the missing

2651.66 --> 2659.009
curvature you got the same problem as

2656.7 --> 2662.519
the global two and it's a big one

2659.009 --> 2665.16
and if you're gonna be forced to resort

2662.519 --> 2667.3799999999997
to some kind of weird light bending to

2665.16 --> 2669.5989999999997
make it all look flat again your being

2667.38 --> 2679.6800000000003
just as idiotic as the globe is when

2669.599 --> 2685.289
they do that so the earth surface is not

2679.68 --> 2686.1299999999997
concave however this realm works that's

2685.289 --> 2688.289
another matter

2686.13 --> 2691.2000000000003
especially if you consider there may be

2688.289 --> 2695.1600000000003
potential special non-linearity going on

2691.2 --> 2698.819
yeah it could be confusing as [ __ ] but

2695.16 --> 2701.519
there is no physical geometrical

2698.819 --> 2704.519
curvature going on it's not there it's

2701.519 --> 2708.359
not physically there so this fantasy

2704.519 --> 2711.6299999999997
about a inside-out earth it's a fantasy

2708.359 --> 2718.17
that's not physically literally real and

2711.63 --> 2723.63
that's the end of it no no your being

2718.17 --> 2726.4500000000003
just as dumb as rumpus is as all the the

2723.63 --> 2729.42
front liner glow bears with their

2726.45 --> 2731.609
unspoken argument of light bending

2729.42 --> 2734.7000000000003
everything into looking into a flat pain

2731.609 --> 2737.21
it's just as dumb as that Jason just as

2734.7 --> 2737.21
dumb as that

2741.97 --> 2754.45
all right yeah I'm not interested in

2750.14 --> 2758.1189999999997
your religious representative Jason

2754.45 --> 2760.49
pretty worrying that you actually think

2758.119 --> 2766.2200000000003
that you have one of those it'd have

2760.49 --> 2769.58
been like me like okay right well I may

2766.22 --> 2773.81
have to point you to my superior in rank

2769.58 --> 2779.5099999999998
mark sergeant's did you know what the

2773.81 --> 2785.81
hell why do you have ranks that's just

2779.51 --> 2788.69
ridiculous only people that don't

2785.81 --> 2795.17
actually know what they're talking about

2788.69 --> 2796.73
are in need of representatives if you

2795.17 --> 2798.7400000000002
actually know what you're talking about

2796.73 --> 2802.64
you should be able to represent it

2798.74 --> 2806.1499999999996
yourself and representing it doesn't

2802.64 --> 2809.33
mean just spam slogans all day long it

2806.15 --> 2812.6600000000003
means actually engaging in conversations

2809.33 --> 2816.67
about it and answering difficult

2812.66 --> 2816.67
questions without red-herring them

2840.07 --> 2846.9100000000003
yeah a by the way Trish Blythe dude did

2844.27 --> 2849.61
you know it's a weird little detail but

2846.91 --> 2853.69
did you know that you're actually not

2849.61 --> 2858.4
supposed to swear on the Bible according

2853.69 --> 2860.86
to the Bible it's pretty freaky it's a

2858.4 --> 2864.1800000000003
country it's in paradoxical action you

2860.86 --> 2864.1800000000003
shouldn't swear on the Bible

2881.83 --> 2886.16
thank you for the super to have the

2883.7 --> 2895.3399999999997
nation Amanda young there goes that

2886.16 --> 2898.7
voice right but that's the thing you

2895.34 --> 2902.84
know think of what's wearing really is

2898.7 --> 2909.1099999999997
an oath an oath is a spoken-- spiritual

2902.84 --> 2911.96
contract when you swear well usually

2909.11 --> 2915.02
people swear on their honor when that

2911.96 --> 2918.2
was held in very high regard and you

2915.02 --> 2920.96
could potentially be killed if you broke

2918.2 --> 2923.54
your honor there that happened in the

2920.96 --> 2927.23
old days okay so people would swear on

2923.54 --> 2929.18
their honor but you can also swear on

2927.23 --> 2932.9900000000002
other things on things that are very

2929.18 --> 2937.73
precious to you and that way reaffirm

2932.99 --> 2940.52
basically put down a a risk for the

2937.73 --> 2943.13
breaking that like that is what you make

2940.52 --> 2945.38
part of the swearing you can swear on

2943.13 --> 2949.1600000000003
the Bible that doesn't make any sense

2945.38 --> 2952.4
like that's almost like okay if I break

2949.16 --> 2955.8999999999996
if I'm not being honest then I reject

2952.4 --> 2959.2400000000002
the Bible how does that make any sense

2955.9 --> 2962.38
do you think that a piece of paper makes

2959.24 --> 2965.0
people unable to lie if they wanted to

2962.38 --> 2967.21
it just doesn't make any sense to me the

2965.0 --> 2967.21
whole thing

2974.829 --> 2977.5190000000002
right

2985.9 --> 2989.61
[Music]

2992.219 --> 2996.599
well that's hilarious

2997.949 --> 3004.859
but I think that judges may actually you

3001.65 --> 3007.319
there there are other you can actually

3004.859 --> 3010.3489999999997
object to swearing to the Bible as part

3007.319 --> 3012.979
of the judicial process I think you can

3010.349 --> 3016.559
swear on some other book but I might

3012.979 --> 3018.779
actually if I'd not be under severe

3016.559 --> 3020.9390000000003
pressure for some reason because things

3018.779 --> 3023.069
went wrong or whatever I might be

3020.939 --> 3024.8089999999997
inclined to just say look I don't want

3023.069 --> 3027.599
to swear on the Bible because that

3024.809 --> 3030.15
doesn't make any sense I'd swear on my

3027.599 --> 3036.449
honor I'd swear on whatever you need but

3030.15 --> 3041.7290000000003
I I will never it doesn't make sense to

3036.449 --> 3044.719
swear on the Bible and they'd probably

3041.729 --> 3044.7189999999996
just accept that

3047.9 --> 3053.9900000000002
swear not by heaven or by earth okay

3053.09 --> 3056.65
where's that from

3053.99 --> 3056.6499999999996
hello ISA

3062.06 --> 3064.87
right

3066.67 --> 3073.2200000000003
well I would not even say like you

3071.119 --> 3077.06
should never swear just don't take it

3073.22 --> 3078.7099999999996
lightly it is like a spiritual contract

3077.06 --> 3081.47
you engage in when you do that if you

3078.71 --> 3087.05
have honor if you have any kind of

3081.47 --> 3092.2
spiritual cohesion and earthing so when

3087.05 --> 3097.4900000000002
I swear and I sometimes do it sometimes

3092.2 --> 3100.8999999999996
then I take it very very seriously I let

3097.49 --> 3103.04
it literally ingrain on my spirit

3100.9 --> 3105.5
because otherwise I wouldn't do it

3103.04 --> 3107.54
I'd only swear on something if I'm

3105.5 --> 3110.72
really certain about my case

3107.54 --> 3115.85
like really beyond the temporary

3110.72 --> 3118.8999999999996
certainty if I know from all angles

3115.85 --> 3118.9
doesn't work

3133.869 --> 3140.739
if you swear on your honor standing

3138.939 --> 3143.14
behind your own words yes and the

3140.739 --> 3149.559
backing of no one I don't know how do

3143.14 --> 3151.17
you mean that do you mean as in nobody's

3149.559 --> 3155.1090000000004
telling you what to say

3151.17 --> 3157.089
or is it like that you don't have any

3155.109 --> 3159.0389999999998
reliability because of it I don't know I

3157.089 --> 3161.549
don't know how you mean that Dave

3159.039 --> 3161.5490000000004
Johnson

3166.82 --> 3173.07
yeah I kind of like that that idea

3170.57 --> 3177.6600000000003
especially because of the misinterpret

3173.07 --> 3195.7200000000003
ability no swearing on Flat Earth how

3177.66 --> 3197.8199999999997
about that I kind of like that although

3195.72 --> 3203.22
the swearing does always seem to slip

3197.82 --> 3214.17
back in now doesn't it but that's the

3203.22 --> 3218.22
other type of swearing it's weird it's

3214.17 --> 3222.38
weird how swearing and cursing has kind

3218.22 --> 3222.3799999999997
of become intertwined in the English

3225.77 --> 3231.9
they calls like don't swear basically

3230.76 --> 3235.44
means don't curse

3231.9 --> 3238.29
don't use negative like a necessarily

3235.44 --> 3240.84
negative language all that it's

3238.29 --> 3243.15
basically cursing it's not swearing it's

3240.84 --> 3244.7000000000003
very weird that they named that swearing

3243.15 --> 3247.62
when did that happen

3244.7 --> 3252.14
when the deaths the English start to use

3247.62 --> 3252.14
the word swearing instead of cursing

3279.489 --> 3283.209
stationary ball Oh

3287.989 --> 3294.099
Zep tepi maybe it's just a flat ball

3290.569 --> 3294.099
never consider that

3308.77 --> 3315.4
right Dave Johnson thank you for

3311.23 --> 3321.43
bringing that but that's kind of wrong

3315.4 --> 3323.53
like you yeah I think that's what most

3321.43 --> 3328.41
people interpret it like but I don't

3323.53 --> 3328.4100000000003
think it's really the right it's like

3328.74 --> 3336.16
it's not supposed to be that way I think

3333.72 --> 3340.3199999999997
so hang on the Bible should be taken

3336.16 --> 3340.3199999999997
seriously well that depends

3346.11 --> 3352.44
I don't know it's it's messy I got the

3350.49 --> 3361.83
idea that swearing on the Bible is

3352.44 --> 3364.8
technically incorrect to do but I don't

3361.83 --> 3367.83
know maybe this is yeah a subject worth

3364.8 --> 3370.2000000000003
debating and I can't really debate it

3367.83 --> 3372.23
just here on my own with the chat I'd

3370.2 --> 3376.47
have to talk with some people maybe ask

3372.23 --> 3380.87
some other Bible experts about it I am

3376.47 --> 3383.91
NOT a Bible expert absolutely I'm not

3380.87 --> 3388.83
like I can't even honestly say that I've

3383.91 --> 3391.6499999999996
read the whole thing but I do recognize

3388.83 --> 3394.5
the power of what I've seen and heard of

3391.65 --> 3396.98
it and people have verbally taught me

3394.5 --> 3396.98
about it

3410.45 --> 3416.9199999999996
all right

3412.97 --> 3416.9199999999996
hmm yeah that's true

3422.76 --> 3429.67
could you imagine that with the Bible

3427.24 --> 3430.8999999999996
thing swearing on it going to the moon

3429.67 --> 3435.54
that one of them would have actually

3430.9 --> 3435.54
done it how crazy would that be

3449.97 --> 3464.08
yeah goodbye Jess and I'm just I'm sick

3457.69 --> 3467.23
of it Oh Oh unban you at some point

3464.08 --> 3470.47

3467.23 --> 3473.38

3470.47 --> 3476.7099999999996
I'm just sick of it for now so please go

3473.38 --> 3479.77
