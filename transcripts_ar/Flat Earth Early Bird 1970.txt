stolen and they just didn't even talk

305.56 --> 307.84
about

308.6 --> 315.08000000000004
it cuz there's a lot of people that are

going to show up to my show today well

955.6 --> 959.77
it's going to be a very short show then

958.48 --> 961.16

[Music]

961.16 --> 966.199

963.88 --> 968.8389999999999
just going to discontinue the show and

966.199 --> 972.16
then it's like oh well you can just not

968.839 --> 977.399
show up to other things out there

972.16 --> 977.399
then yeah go find your own entertainment

977.88 --> 983.72
then you're not even bothering to show

980.44 --> 985.9590000000001

983.72 --> 990.3190000000001
I even doing

985.959 --> 993.279

990.319 --> 996.16
just filled like two or three hours with

993.279 --> 998.68
blabbering without any interaction then

996.16 --> 1002.079
I would just do that every

998.68 --> 1002.079
time but I

1012.079 --> 1018.04
can't I mean I might on a rare occasion

1016.16 --> 1020.079
maybe once a week I'll have like

1018.04 --> 1022.16
inspiration like that that I really

1020.079 --> 1024.559
don't need the chat as

1022.16 --> 1027.0
much and then of course everybody's

1024.559 --> 1029.48
going to roll in and blabber on and

1027.0 --> 1032.12
endlessly whine for my attention right

1029.48 --> 1033.72
when I'm in the flow or something but

1032.12 --> 1036.2399999999998
then when there's all the room in the

1033.72 --> 1038.839
world then nobody shows up and then yeah

1036.24 --> 1041.88
then there is no show it's just me

1038.839 --> 1045.36
sitting there being

1041.88 --> 1047.0
still being quiet waiting for somebody

1045.36 --> 1050.52
to show up in my

1047.0 --> 1055.96
chat with 20 plus people still watching

1050.52 --> 1055.96
for some damn reason 22

1080.64 --> 1085.1200000000001
all right anyway I'm just going to eat

1082.679 --> 1089.24
my Illuminati cand then and we'll see if

1085.12 --> 1089.2399999999998
somebody shows up in 10 minutes or

1107.76 --> 1110.76
not

1137.72 --> 1140.72
for

1167.72 --> 1174.83
e e

1170.54 --> 1177.859
[Applause]

1174.83 --> 1177.859
[Music]

1180.58 --> 1183.78
[Music]

1220.6 --> 1229.12
all right in the meantime NATO calls

1223.919 --> 1232.5590000000002
out we only need 40 billion a year

1229.12 --> 1237.6
for Ukraine until Russia is defeated oh

1232.559 --> 1237.6
really so how exactly does that

1239.36 --> 1246.799
work like show to me like how those 40

1243.72 --> 1250.48
billion a year is going to defeat Russia

1246.799 --> 1253.6
cuz it just looks like a

1250.48 --> 1259.679
gigantic money laundering

1253.6 --> 1259.6789999999999
scam which is what no doubt it is

1260.039 --> 1265.52
yeah war crimes money laundering

1267.76 --> 1272.72
operation and it's not going to defeat

1270.52 --> 1276.4
Russia like they don't even they can't

1272.72 --> 1279.24
even tell you how exactly that would

1276.4 --> 1282.0800000000002
happen it's just pay

1279.24 --> 1284.1200000000001
money oh for

1282.08 --> 1286.48
something but I mean they're not going

1284.12 --> 1290.52
to explain to you exactly how that 40

1286.48 --> 1290.52
billion is going to defeat Russia

1290.88 --> 1293.6000000000001
cuz it

1297.08 --> 1302.08
won't it's

1299.559 --> 1304.2
like people in the west are going to

1302.08 --> 1307.279
just have to pay gigantic amounts of

1304.2 --> 1309.8400000000001
money as punishment for that Russia is

1307.279 --> 1309.84
technically

1310.76 --> 1316.48
undefeatable and we're going to have to

1312.72 --> 1319.3600000000001
pay for that not to actually make them

1316.48 --> 1321.279
defeated but just because they can

1319.36 --> 1323.3999999999999
they can't be defeated we're just going

1321.279 --> 1326.4
to have to pay for

1323.4 --> 1326.4
that

1331.35 --> 1337.1589999999999
[Music]

1334.64 --> 1339.039
somehow yep and nobody's going to stop

1337.159 --> 1341.7990000000002
them because anybody who would have

1339.039 --> 1345.44
actually stood up against

1341.799 --> 1348.72
NATO well their votes just

1345.44 --> 1352.88
disappear they don't exist

1348.72 --> 1356.679

1356.679 --> 1361.72
flinches like yeah yeah no nobody votes

1359.44 --> 1361.72
for

1361.919 --> 1367.0
them like they are in the media the

1365.48 --> 1370.4
Nazis or

1367.0 --> 1373.12
something they're the Badman so their

1370.4 --> 1374.799
votes just don't show up and nobody

1373.12 --> 1377.559
flinches because

1374.799 --> 1379.52

1377.559 --> 1382.36
doesn't work a lot with the [ __ ]

1379.52 --> 1384.76
program well then they don't

1382.36 --> 1388.76
exist

1384.76 --> 1392.12
yeah if you're not a player in the New

1388.76 --> 1395.32
World Order corrupted communist [ __ ]

1392.12 --> 1397.279
system that lies about everything and

1395.32 --> 1400.799

do I'm ready to die I'm ready to to burn

1576.399 --> 1582.4399999999998
up to burn with the whole city just do

1580.0 --> 1589.0
it I'm so [ __ ] sick of this world man

1582.44 --> 1589.0
I'm so sick of it just burn it all down

[Music]

1628.279 --> 1634.88

orino I'm going to keep it as a rule of

1639.24 --> 1645.88
fist if it's your opinion if you believe

1642.679 --> 1648.52
it well then I'm going to assume that

1645.88 --> 1650.5590000000002
it's exactly the opposite of what ever

1648.52 --> 1651.52
it is you believe because you're such a

[ __ ]

1651.52 --> 1656.039
Ballard everything you believe is

1663.36 --> 1669.6
wrong yeah and I didn't didn't just

1666.799 --> 1672.279
mention oh please just bomb us as some

1669.6 --> 1674.7199999999998
kind of like oh sarcasm we're so

1672.279 --> 1678.24
threatened like I don't give a [ __ ] I

1674.72 --> 1683.3600000000001
mean it just [ __ ] bomb the [ __ ] out

1678.24 --> 1683.36
of this place do it

1687.279 --> 1693.32
launch this place is done there's

1690.24 --> 1697.6
nothing to be salvaged

1693.32 --> 1697.6
here we're done

1712.96 --> 1718.3600000000001
no they're not orino wumble shut the

1715.919 --> 1718.3600000000001
[ __ ]

1729.44 --> 1733.88
up don't know what the hell you're

1731.559 --> 1733.8799999999999
talking

1737.039 --> 1741.08
about for

1782.919 --> 1789.159
besides like what the [ __ ] does it even

1785.12 --> 1791.84
matter if they're using tanks from the

1789.159 --> 1794.0800000000002
60s even if they did like it doesn't

1791.84 --> 1798.1999999999998
matter man you can like roll in with

1794.08 --> 1801.32
your hyper modern tanks built last year

1798.2 --> 1804.3600000000001
and it just gets blown up very quickly

1801.32 --> 1806.96
so who the [ __ ] cares from what time

1804.36 --> 1806.9599999999998
their tanks

1813.32 --> 1820.399
are oh thought you could use some

1815.36 --> 1823.1999999999998
interaction yes yes by being a piece of

1820.399 --> 1825.6
[ __ ] yeah oh I needed an interaction

1823.2 --> 1829.0
with somebody that just immediately

1825.6 --> 1832.36
sides incorrectly

1829.0 --> 1836.159
goes to an opposition like a a piece of

1832.36 --> 1836.1589999999999
[ __ ] yeah that's what I

1839.0 --> 1844.2
needed I should move to Russia well I

1841.88 --> 1846.3600000000001
would I would [ __ ] move to Russia

1844.2 --> 1849.32
it's just

1846.36 --> 1850.519
that I don't know how to speak Russian I

1849.32 --> 1855.2
never

1850.519 --> 1855.2
will it's way too complicated for

1855.519 --> 1860.3990000000001
me they don't allow cannabis that's a

1861.88 --> 1869.8400000000001
problem yeah I just want to be living in

1865.519 --> 1869.84
a place where not everything is a

1871.399 --> 1877.2399999999998
lie where this a fake democracy where

1874.6 --> 1879.6
votes literally just don't show up and

1877.24 --> 1883.6
nobody says anything about

1879.6 --> 1883.6
it yeah

1889.91 --> 1893.059
[Music]

1893.76 --> 1899.559
where supposed leadership tells us oh we

1896.559 --> 1901.96
just need tons and tons of money and

1899.559 --> 1904.799
then the enemy will be defeated even

1901.96 --> 1907.48
though it won't and they won't

1904.799 --> 1909.559
technically even tell you how that's

1907.48 --> 1912.279
supposed to defeat them no you just have

1909.559 --> 1915.36
to pay all your money to amount to

1912.279 --> 1917.96
absolutely nothing and you can't decide

1915.36 --> 1920.1589999999999
on any other recourse because if you

1917.96 --> 1921.679
vote on some kind of political party

1920.159 --> 1926.48
that wants something different while

1921.679 --> 1926.48
your vote just doesn't even show up

1948.74 --> 1958.88
[Music]

1955.88 --> 1958.88
that

1992.919 --> 2000.039
oh hello real Science Education I'm sure

1996.6 --> 2003.1999999999998
yeah you're really reliable person I'm

2000.039 --> 2005.799
sure welcome to the

2003.2 --> 2008.0800000000002
show with your new account made

2005.799 --> 2011.639
yesterday

2008.08 --> 2015.279
real Science Education I'm I'm sure sure

2011.639 --> 2015.279
that's going to be a delightful

2035.2 --> 2041.159
interaction hello the wolf pack

2039.519 --> 2042.44
so you're actually going to make this

2041.159 --> 2045.48
[ __ ]

2042.44 --> 2048.44
argument like how dare you how dare you

2045.48 --> 2052.399
not irrationally be against Putin and

2048.44 --> 2054.96
Russia D the Batman cuz if you don't

2052.399 --> 2058.879
think so then your life gets

2054.96 --> 2061.399
[ __ ] cuz we live in a communist

2058.879 --> 2063.96
society and if you don't go with the

2061.399 --> 2069.04
party line of the Communist

2063.96 --> 2069.04
Society well then you the Batman

2078.44 --> 2081.5190000000002
[Music]

2096.76 --> 2101.48
yeah yeah that's right hacker mode very

2099.92 --> 2104.6800000000003
[ __ ] funny isn't

2101.48 --> 2108.16
it yeah because this is my country this

2104.68 --> 2108.16
is where I was born it's

2109.359 --> 2114.839
[ __ ] but I

2111.96 --> 2116.44
mean what's the point moving to another

2114.839 --> 2118.7599999999998
country where

2116.44 --> 2121.599
it's completely

2118.76 --> 2124.3590000000004
different I don't speak the language and

2121.599 --> 2127.6800000000003
I wouldn't be able to consume what I'm

2124.359 --> 2127.68
used to

2129.52 --> 2132.52
what the [ __ ] is the

2141.76 --> 2150.1600000000003
point like I don't have much to offer to

2145.64 --> 2154.8799999999997
Russia like they wouldn't exactly

2150.16 --> 2154.8799999999997
like welcome me in

2164.0 --> 2168.359
yeah but nobody thinks of that of course

2166.28 --> 2170.28
because oh well you could just move

2168.359 --> 2172.7599999999998
there and there and it's like oh yeah of

2170.28 --> 2176.44
course sure could just do that yeah no

2172.76 --> 2176.44
no it doesn't really work like that at

2183.8 --> 2190.48
all yeah I mean if I had some elaborate

2188.119 --> 2191.96
working career then perhaps perhaps they

2190.48 --> 2195.319
would just take

2191.96 --> 2199.0
me but I don't I'm just some weirdo guy

2195.319 --> 2202.0
living on social welfare talking about

2199.0 --> 2202.0
things like Flat

2202.88 --> 2207.6800000000003
Earth

2204.72 --> 2210.56
yeah they're not going to welcome me in

2207.68 --> 2212.52
but nobody here gives a [ __ ] about that

2210.56 --> 2214.92
you just want to shoot your [ __ ]

2212.52 --> 2218.44
mouth off like oh if you love Russia so

2214.92 --> 2222.56
much why don't you just go there then

2218.44 --> 2222.56
cuz you're all bunch of [ __ ] [ __ ]

2231.4 --> 2234.489
[Music]

2246.52 --> 2250.48
retards for

2298.88 --> 2303.7200000000003
yeah I'm in a shitty mood and nobody's

2301.24 --> 2305.839
going to help me out everybody's just

2303.72 --> 2307.52
going to pile on and make it worse

2305.839 --> 2310.68
because that's what you love to do is

2307.52 --> 2313.119
isn't it that's what you're here for oh

2310.68 --> 2315.7999999999997
look Arn's in a bad mood oh let's try to

2313.119 --> 2315.8
make it even

2333.4 --> 2341.319
worse well maybe borders boy isn't going

2336.0 --> 2341.319
to do that maybe he gets it who

2346.64 --> 2354.72
knows yeah you could [ __ ] kill

2349.079 --> 2354.7200000000003
yourself hacker mode [ __ ] you

2371.599 --> 2376.319
where the New World Order fits into this

2374.119 --> 2380.04
like I don't understand the context of

2376.319 --> 2380.04
your question wolf

2390.4 --> 2395.56
pack I mean the New World Order in this

2392.88 --> 2399.1600000000003
sense is just it's just an agenda it's

2395.56 --> 2402.16
just a direction and like you just can't

2399.16 --> 2402.16
take any other

2402.2 --> 2408.52
Direction that's what it is at this

2405.72 --> 2411.68
point the support for Ukraine yeah that

2408.52 --> 2413.16
is new world order that is absolutely

2411.68 --> 2416.359
New World

2413.16 --> 2419.5989999999997
Order it's a giant military industrial

2416.359 --> 2419.5989999999997
money laundering

2426.119 --> 2433.4
scam cuz because the military industrial

2428.839 --> 2436.48
complex here in Europe is totally Nazi

2433.4 --> 2436.48
they are the

2436.68 --> 2442.0789999999997
Nazis they don't give a [ __ ] about the

2439.359 --> 2445.4
public they don't give a [ __ ] about

2442.079 --> 2449.5600000000004
defense they only want power and people

2445.4 --> 2453.2000000000003
are just cattle to them cattle to be

2449.56 --> 2455.599
slaughtered and belabored until death

2453.2 --> 2460.2799999999997
that's how they see the people and

2455.599 --> 2460.28
that's how this is planned out for

2490.44 --> 2495.359
Monday night Wars what does that

2504.16 --> 2509.92
mean I don't know what that means

2507.48 --> 2512.92
dude all right I'll be right back in two

2509.92 --> 2512.92
minutes

2546.119 --> 2549.119
okay

2576.119 --> 2579.119
for

2606.119 --> 2610.079
e for

2666.16 --> 2670.0789999999997
hey the P Sun for

[Music]

2710.19 --> 2713.849
[Music]

2726.96 --> 2729.96
for

2765.68 --> 2770.72
all right in the meantime the Earth is

2769.04 --> 2773.44
flat

2770.72 --> 2775.9199999999996
measured calculated

2773.44 --> 2778.92
observed

2775.92 --> 2778.92
navigated

2779.359 --> 2784.44
flat Horizon is not geometric

2801.64 --> 2806.96
let's just talk about that all day long

2803.8 --> 2810.8
while we all get [ __ ] over with

2806.96 --> 2810.8
supposed elections

2831.0 --> 2836.119
yeah

2833.28 --> 2838.7200000000003
elections but you can only elect slave

2836.119 --> 2842.48
masters not

2838.72 --> 2842.48
leaders and that's how it

2845.839 --> 2848.839
works

2875.839 --> 2879.72
for hello Kumo

2905.76 --> 2908.76
virus

2929.9 --> 2933.01
[Music]

2935.72 --> 2939.7599999999998
for for

2966.07 --> 2969.2690000000002
[Applause]

3024.24 --> 3027.8799999999997
hey Richard G

3030.96 --> 3035.44
container need a release valve

3044.04 --> 3050.7599999999998
no why is the pressure always the same

3047.64 --> 3055.16
it's not always exactly the same it's a

3050.76 --> 3055.1600000000003
dynamic system Richard G

3067.839 --> 3071.68
there's no release valve that would

3069.839 --> 3074.599
suggest that there's another place that

3071.68 --> 3076.16
it could equalize pressure with there's

3074.599 --> 3079.1600000000003
no evidence of that

3076.16 --> 3079.16
whatsoever

3079.599 --> 3084.92
but I don't know how the pressure is

3082.52 --> 3088.04
exactly regulated within the system

3084.92 --> 3090.76
there might be

3088.04 --> 3093.0
something that would kind of seem

3090.76 --> 3098.0
similar to a release valve although it

3093.0 --> 3098.0
wouldn't be a oneway well release

3098.88 --> 3103.96
valve rather like a pressure regulator

3101.76 --> 3103.96
or

3110.119 --> 3115.0
something who knows how that works

3124.16 --> 3129.5989999999997
but I mean in a way in a sense like if

3126.799 --> 3133.48
the pre like logically even if like the

3129.599 --> 3135.839
pressure would lower then things like

3133.48 --> 3135.839
the

3136.44 --> 3144.88
evaporation border within material will

3140.359 --> 3146.64
simply go down then until it equalizes

3144.88 --> 3150.359
again

3146.64 --> 3150.359
so you could argue

3150.4 --> 3156.1600000000003
that the materials within the realm

3153.4 --> 3159.04
function automatically as a a pressure

3156.16 --> 3159.04
regulation

3159.079 --> 3164.28
system because for some reason if the

3162.0 --> 3167.16
volume is increased but the material

3164.28 --> 3168.559
isn't well then the material that is

3167.16 --> 3171.1189999999997
present will

3168.559 --> 3174.6400000000003
simply

3171.119 --> 3178.48
alter because of the pressure to

3174.64 --> 3182.359
eventually equalize things again you

3178.48 --> 3184.72
could think of it as like oh just enough

3182.359 --> 3185.97
water just starts to evaporate to

3184.72 --> 3188.359
equalize the

3185.97 --> 3190.68
[Music]

3188.359 --> 3193.64
pressure right or if the pressure would

3190.68 --> 3197.0
increase well then more water vapor

3193.64 --> 3197.0
would actually

3199.04 --> 3205.599
condensate so in that sense like even

3202.48 --> 3208.44
cloud formation and Rain are part of

3205.599 --> 3208.44
pressure regul

3212.76 --> 3218.2400000000002
so yeah that system you're talking about

3214.64 --> 3223.0789999999997
to equalize the pressure that may simply

3218.24 --> 3223.0789999999997
be the water cycle of

3223.2 --> 3229.359
clouds and rain and water evaporation

3226.88 --> 3230.92
that may be the thing that basically

3229.359 --> 3232.88
balances out the

3230.92 --> 3237.0
pressure good question by the way

3232.88 --> 3237.0
richardy I appreciate it

3252.72 --> 3256.72
built-in regulation right in front of

3254.44 --> 3258.2400000000002
your eyes that's right

3256.72 --> 3261.839
exactly

3258.24 --> 3265.839
right local response to pressure

3261.839 --> 3265.839
differentials local

3269.119 --> 3273.1600000000003
I've been pondering on that a lot lately

3274.359 --> 3278.72
cool well if you have questions in that

3276.799 --> 3281.92
direction you're always welcome here

3278.72 --> 3285.0789999999997
that that is what the type of questions

3281.92 --> 3287.96
I like to answer you know those are the

3285.079 --> 3291.04
things I like to figure

3287.96 --> 3293.04
out it's just I'm not just going to

3291.04 --> 3294.88
figure it out on my own though when

3293.04 --> 3298.52
nobody gives a

3294.88 --> 3300.88
[ __ ] but if if you give a [ __ ] well then

3298.52 --> 3303.88
we can move on we can actually figure it

3300.88 --> 3303.88
out

3327.28 --> 3330.1600000000003
what the [ __ ] is

3334.559 --> 3340.6400000000003
that why are you posting

3337.2 --> 3340.64

timed out yeah well the next time you

5392.159 --> 5399.159
say that in my chat I'm going to B you

5429.639 --> 5436.2390000000005
imagination I don't believe that [ __ ] at

5432.88 --> 5436.2390000000005
all that's

5450.48 --> 5456.638999999999
insane like that's genuinely insane I've

5453.4 --> 5456.638999999999
never even heard of

5462.48 --> 5468.28
that but so is flat what the [ __ ] does

5466.36 --> 5472.36
that have to do with

5468.28 --> 5475.8
it radically a different from

5472.36 --> 5478.0
yeah or maybe you could rephrase that as

5475.8 --> 5480.2390000000005
in a

5478.0 --> 5483.199
fraud a

5480.239 --> 5487.08
forgery not the real thing ever

5483.199 --> 5487.08
considered that Larry

5542.84 --> 5546.88
for e

5554.44 --> 5559.4
[Music]

5585.679 --> 5594.04
well that's just Cleary I mean that is

5588.88 --> 5599.04
that is like too [ __ ] up to be

5594.04 --> 5599.04
real I mean that literally cannot be

5601.4 --> 5607.119
real I mean I'm willing to throw that

5604.6 --> 5610.119000000001
[ __ ] at a Mandela effect at this point I

5607.119 --> 5616.159
mean that is such an insane alteration

5610.119 --> 5616.159
that is like literally inexcusable

5617.88 --> 5620.88
like

5621.56 --> 5628.400000000001
inexcusable like that that cannot have

5625.0 --> 5632.08
been the original it can't it would have

5628.4 --> 5635.599999999999
been in everybody's face yeah if that

5632.08 --> 5638.4
would have been real then [ __ ] shws

5635.6 --> 5641.400000000001
and and satanists would have just said

5638.4 --> 5643.799999999999
uh Jesus was a child molester Jesus was

5641.4 --> 5646.638999999999
a child BL they would have been saying

5643.8 --> 5649.400000000001
that to us for like 30 years every

5646.639 --> 5650.639
[ __ ] time we bumped into them yeah if

5649.4 --> 5654.96
that was

5650.639 --> 5657.639
real it makes no [ __ ] sense

5654.96 --> 5660.4
Clary nobody knows ancient Greek yeah

5657.639 --> 5663.119
except for really smart oppositionally

5660.4 --> 5665.719
defined people that will [ __ ] figure

5663.119 --> 5665.719
that out

5670.36 --> 5672.92
this is

5689.08 --> 5694.48
insane

5690.88 --> 5698.159000000001
fist what the [ __ ] is that even

5694.48 --> 5698.159
it makes no goddamn sense

5722.639 --> 5726.679
Cleary e

5762.6 --> 5768.159000000001
mean where are you getting this [ __ ]

5764.639 --> 5770.96
from what is your

5768.159 --> 5773.239
Source oh I got it from the original

5770.96 --> 5775.679
Greek tech oh really the original Greek

5773.239 --> 5778.119
Tech is just right there on the

5775.679 --> 5782.88
internet I mean yeah oh what the

5778.119 --> 5782.88
original Greek text is just there

5809.96 --> 5815.04
but imagine what imagine that makes no

5812.84 --> 5818.1990000000005
[ __ ] sense

5815.04 --> 5821.36
dude Jesus literally said

5818.199 --> 5824.239
that remember this the most famous quote

5821.36 --> 5826.719
if you hurt the children what you

5824.239 --> 5831.32
deserve and all that millstone around

5826.719 --> 5831.32
your neck I mean it makes no [ __ ]

5831.52 --> 5837.639
sense it makes no sense

5868.84 --> 5876.159000000001
what nestly what the [ __ ] is that

5872.239 --> 5876.159
even okay okay

5877.719 --> 5883.679
so I don't know what kind of source this

5880.76 --> 5883.679
is but

5888.119 --> 5891.639
the I don't get

5895.96 --> 5901.719
it I mean

5898.119 --> 5901.719
who who made

5902.44 --> 5906.48
that e

5937.719 --> 5945.44
do you understand

5940.88 --> 5948.04
they oh yeah clearly oh yes of course oh

5945.44 --> 5952.239
just oh

5948.04 --> 5955.239
yeah what what a great end result

5952.239 --> 5955.239
brilliant

5965.679 --> 5972.52
yes I have watched Eric Dub's video

5969.0 --> 5972.52
about Jesus

5973.56 --> 5977.52
duper this is [ __ ]

5979.159 --> 5987.36
insane like I'm against deification

5984.04 --> 5989.719
which is idol worship of Jesus I've been

5987.36 --> 5993.48
fighting against that for quite some

5989.719 --> 5996.52
time but to just say that he's a [ __ ]

5993.48 --> 5996.5199999999995
pedo this is

6000.56 --> 6004.159000000001
insane it's just

6004.84 --> 6010.1990000000005
insane there is no logical reason for

6007.84 --> 6010.1990000000005
that

6015.119 --> 6021.159
whatsoever the Bible says it not me yeah

6018.239 --> 6023.678999999999
I don't trust that [ __ ]

6021.159 --> 6026.48
Bible like I don't trust any anything

6023.679 --> 6026.4800000000005
about it at this

6026.679 --> 6033.4800000000005
point I mean maybe it is just getting

6030.0 --> 6036.44
completely twisted up there are weird

6033.48 --> 6038.879999999999
things Mandela related things that seem

6036.44 --> 6043.04
to be happening with the Bible in

6038.88 --> 6043.04
general like it's trans

6048.52 --> 6054.4400000000005
mutating so yeah maybe uh well maybe in

6051.679 --> 6057.32
10 years it'll be like oh oh yeah Jesus

6054.44 --> 6059.879999999999
oh he's so great but he's like this Arch

6057.32 --> 6062.159
criminal that just tortures and murders

6059.88 --> 6064.1990000000005
people and like Slaughters children for

6062.159 --> 6067.5199999999995
the fun of it I mean is that what the

6064.199 --> 6067.5199999999995
Bible's going to turn into

6073.48 --> 6078.799999999999
then is that what that is is that's

6076.76 --> 6082.280000000001
what's going to happen this is too

6078.8 --> 6085.2390000000005
[ __ ] insane to be tanni it's too

6082.28 --> 6085.239
[ __ ] insane

6112.239 --> 6116.199
f for

6149.96 --> 6155.52
oh you will grab a link oh yes I'm sure

you will

6194.44 --> 6197.32

6202.119 --> 6206.08
[ __ ] e

6234.599 --> 6240.599
wow is there anybody in the

6237.119 --> 6243.199
chat of that video that actually

6240.599 --> 6245.400000000001
addresses what the [ __ ] there is being

6243.199 --> 6249.36
talked about the only damn thing I can

6245.4 --> 6249.36
see is complaining about [ __ ]

6250.599 --> 6254.599
Interruption Jesus

6263.32 --> 6266.32
e

6318.52 --> 6324.92
yeah it looks like complete nonsense

6320.56 --> 6329.119000000001
Clary it looks like complete hor

6324.92 --> 6329.119
[ __ ] I don't believe this at

6332.4 --> 6340.0
all some heavy stuff yes some

6335.76 --> 6343.639
heavy heavy satanic misinformation crap

6340.0 --> 6349.4
is what that is I don't trust that at

6343.639 --> 6349.400000000001
all it makes no logical sense whatsoever

6375.239 --> 6382.4
you L to about everything yeah you just

6377.84 --> 6384.0
got lied to about everything just now oh

6382.4 --> 6385.879999999999
everything is is wrong everything is

6384.0 --> 6388.92
inside out yeah including the things

6385.88 --> 6392.400000000001
that really aren't so you're just

6388.92 --> 6394.639
being it's called getting twisted into

6392.4 --> 6398.159
the Reversed World clear that's what I

6394.639 --> 6398.159000000001
think's happening to you right

6402.4 --> 6410.598999999999

6406.28 --> 6414.08
into the rever world this is absolute

6410.599 --> 6416.4800000000005
horeshit yeah Jesus Christ

6414.08 --> 6418.8
even though not God himself because that

6416.48 --> 6423.159
makes no logical sense it's definitely

6418.8 --> 6426.8
not a [ __ ] pedo this is

6423.159 --> 6429.04
insane like he would have [ __ ] killed

6426.8 --> 6433.28
himself if that would have

6429.04 --> 6433.28
happened it makes no damn

6440.76 --> 6448.360000000001
sense this has got to be a plant this is

6443.96 --> 6451.159
has to be a plant this cannot be real

6448.36 --> 6451.159
this cannot be

6471.84 --> 6474.84
reliable

6501.76 --> 6504.76
e

6531.719 --> 6535.76
e e

6587.84 --> 6593.2390000000005
all right see you later H lunabar I mean

6596.88 --> 6602.4400000000005
this you must drop this or I will drop

6599.84 --> 6605.88
your wrench this cannot be real this is

6602.44 --> 6605.879999999999

6649.639 --> 6655.88
it doesn't fit it must be lice it

6652.36 --> 6658.079
doesn't fit it makes no logical sense it

6655.88 --> 6660.079
makes no contextual sense it makes no

6658.079 --> 6662.639
sense it has to be a

6660.079 --> 6665.28
forgery this cannot be

6662.639 --> 6669.599
real it doesn't

6665.28 --> 6669.599
fit doesn't fit with anything

6680.52 --> 6685.639
else like why why that hell would he

6683.8 --> 6687.360000000001
even do

6685.639 --> 6691.719
that

6687.36 --> 6691.719
why it makes no damn

6694.28 --> 6699.32
sense like why would he do something

6696.639 --> 6701.76
that would literally nullify everything

6699.32 --> 6701.759999999999
that he's

6705.119 --> 6710.679
taught it's

6707.36 --> 6713.159
insane and it makes no logical sense

6710.679 --> 6715.4
whatsoever

6713.159 --> 6717.799999999999
like from that perspective like why the

6715.4 --> 6721.079
[ __ ] would Jesus even say dying on the

6717.8 --> 6723.28
cross oh why have you forsaken me when

6721.079 --> 6725.84
God obviously wouldn't be with him

6723.28 --> 6729.04
anymore after he done that by his own

6725.84 --> 6733.679
[ __ ] explanations like nothing about

6729.04 --> 6733.679
it makes sense it has to be a

6734.32 --> 6738.88

8569.2 --> 8574.08
back tomorrow I don't know maybe like my

8571.439 --> 8577.2
mood will like swing around

8574.08 --> 8579.479
enormously I mean I'm pretty sure that

8577.2 --> 8583.880000000001
as long as well clear doesn't have a

8579.479 --> 8587.039999999999
wrench anymore I he might never show up

8583.88 --> 8589.08
again cuz for what he did I actually

8587.04 --> 8591.68
just want to ban him

8589.08 --> 8594.56
permanently like to bring up something

8591.68 --> 8594.56
that [ __ ]

8595.72 --> 8600.92
vile is just it's Unforgivable

8601.319 --> 8607.039999999999
that is literally

8603.84 --> 8609.76
unforgivable he probably knew it he knew

8607.04 --> 8612.319000000001
it he couldn't help

8609.76 --> 8617.12
himself clar is a little

8612.319 --> 8617.119999999999
sick he is a little sick he has this

8617.6 --> 8625.439
sickness oppositional defines this

8621.2 --> 8628.399000000001
order that goes straight in opposition

8625.439 --> 8630.64
to anything good at times and he does

8628.399 --> 8632.039999999999
that and it's really sick it's a a

8630.64 --> 8636.358999999999
sickening

8632.04 --> 8638.84
behavior and it needs to be

8636.359 --> 8641.12
contained and I thought that he was

8638.84 --> 8642.92
doing pretty well you know he had a

8641.12 --> 8645.160000000002
wrench he had kind of deserved it and

8642.92 --> 8648.8
then he had to do something really

8645.16 --> 8651.119999999999
[ __ ] sick like this and it's ruined

8648.8 --> 8653.8
everything it's ruined my mood it's

8651.12 --> 8657.2
ruined my trust in him it's ruined

8653.8 --> 8657.199999999999
Today's Show

8667.16 --> 8671.56
so yeah that's good great isn't it the

8669.16 --> 8673.84
only [ __ ] wrench that even shows up

8671.56 --> 8676.8
and I had to take the

8673.84 --> 8680.56
wrench that's the early bir show the

8676.8 --> 8683.278999999999
show where there's like 15 people that

8680.56 --> 8686.359
have wrenches and none of them showed up

8683.279 --> 8689.560000000001
on a [ __ ] Friday no

8686.359 --> 8690.880000000001
less except for one guy that lost the

8689.56 --> 8697.0
wrench

8690.88 --> 8697.0
cuz he had to post something absurdly V

8721.439 --> 8727.64
all right so yeah I'll be back tomorrow

8724.04 --> 8729.720000000001
maybe I'll be back

8727.64 --> 8732.72

8737.84 --> 8743.24
1971 who knows maybe it'll be next week

8740.52 --> 8746.800000000001
or something may maybe I just wait until

8743.24 --> 8749.96
like actual War breaks out and I can

8746.8 --> 8753.119999999999
like report like yeah yeah today this

8749.96 --> 8756.199999999999
city blew up maybe that's when I'll come

8753.12 --> 8756.2
back have something to

8757.12 --> 8763.640000000001
report cuz I don't want to hang around

8759.72 --> 8763.64
with people that are just

8768.84 --> 8772.76
corrupting I don't want to do this

8775.92 --> 8781.56
anymore two days ago was a great show I

8779.04 --> 8784.439
wish I wish I had a show like that again

8781.56 --> 8788.24
where it could just have fluid subject

8784.439 --> 8791.16
people would actually get along with

8788.24 --> 8793.84
it make a good

8791.16 --> 8797.0
point

8793.84 --> 8801.68
listen not want to talk about absolute

8797.0 --> 8801.68
nonsense or just straight out

8806.0 --> 8811.56
evil I didn't exactly help myself today

8809.399 --> 8816.84
by being in a shitty mood when I started

8811.56 --> 8816.84
out the show but I mean this is just

8834.76 --> 8841.399
terrible so yeah maybe I'm just GNA like

8837.8 --> 8843.679999999998
pray for a couple of days or something

8841.399 --> 8846.68
just going to meditate and pray and just

8843.68 --> 8851.04
get myself back in a better frequency

8846.68 --> 8851.04
and get away from this

8854.52 --> 8861.16
crap yeah and I don't need any [ __ ]

8902.2 --> 8907.84
you could sneak it in no

8904.68 --> 8910.279
Ben yeah that's a wrestling reference

8907.84 --> 8910.279
your

8910.96 --> 8915.839999999998
band you asked for it

8937.3 --> 8941.519999999999
[Music]

8939.0 --> 8943.319
I just I don't want to round out on this

8941.52 --> 8945.479000000001
crap I don't want to round out on this

8943.319 --> 8949.16
terrible

8945.479 --> 8950.479
feeling this is not how I want to end

8949.16 --> 8953.88
this I

8950.479 --> 8956.92
want I want it to be

8953.88 --> 8960.64
better oh finally you're home great

8956.92 --> 8962.2
timing oh sorry it's just Today's show

8960.64 --> 8966.199999999999
was just

8962.2 --> 8966.2
horrendous Optimus

8972.479 --> 8977.0
horrendous I'm trying to recover before

8975.04 --> 8978.560000000001
I round out because I just don't want to

8977.0 --> 8980.8
leave it on that kind of like

8978.56 --> 8984.88
demoralizing tone I just don't want to

8980.8 --> 8984.88
end it like this this is

8991.96 --> 8995.199999999999
[Music]

9008.2 --> 9012.560000000001
Earth remains flat though yeah of course

9010.279 --> 9012.560000000001
it

9013.6 --> 9021.84
does but according to Clary now

9016.72 --> 9021.84
apparently Jesus was a child rapist

9025.64 --> 9029.599999999999
yeah isn't that just [ __ ]

9033.0 --> 9041.88
delightful yeah exactly that's that was

9036.76 --> 9041.880000000001
my response too before I took his

9042.52 --> 9048.12
wrench didn't show up after that by the

9045.399 --> 9051.72
way I don't know what the [ __ ] is wrong

9048.12 --> 9051.720000000001
with people man

9056.86 --> 9059.989000000001
[Music]

9063.93 --> 9067.1
[Music]

9074.16 --> 9080.84
I just I'm just going to have to be all

9077.6 --> 9085.92
stupid standard Christian and say just I

9080.84 --> 9089.92
hope that Jesus forgives clear for his

9085.92 --> 9092.439
vile oppositionally defiant

9089.92 --> 9095.68
nature and I mean I can't just call

9092.439 --> 9095.68
blasphemy at this

9096.69 --> 9101.960000000001
[Music]

9099.0 --> 9105.6
point it's not something I typically do

9101.96 --> 9105.599999999999
but it's just what the hell

9106.279 --> 9112.16
man good luck with that judment day yeah

9109.96 --> 9115.56
and he had like supposed biblical

9112.16 --> 9118.08
references too some ancient Greek

9115.56 --> 9121.68
[ __ ] and he claimed like oh this is it

9118.08 --> 9121.68
oh somebody made a video about

9123.88 --> 9128.92
it and I'm like just what the

9131.92 --> 9137.52
[ __ ] okay through the furnace I'll see

9134.319 --> 9137.519999999999
you later

9159.279 --> 9164.439
you would say was blasphemy about okay

9186.8 --> 9192.16
he needs to do more study I don't know

9189.439 --> 9192.16
if that's going to

9193.64 --> 9199.278999999999
help I mean if you're going to easily

9197.24 --> 9201.319
draw a conclusion like that I don't

9199.279 --> 9203.479000000001
think more stud is going to be helpful

9201.319 --> 9203.479
to

9208.23 --> 9211.4
[Music]

9228.72 --> 9232.76
you e

9274.08 --> 9281.2
yeah it is yeah that's a good

9278.359 --> 9283.640000000001
point it is like everybody's showing

9281.2 --> 9289.800000000001
some form of breaking

9283.64 --> 9289.8
point it's an interesting perception

9290.56 --> 9297.68
but I mean I feel I'm breaking apart too

9293.56 --> 9297.68
man I just got so demoralized

9311.64 --> 9318.199999999999
today cuz well basically the voting

9316.2 --> 9320.84
system just got rigged

9318.2 --> 9325.800000000001
again just like last time and I did kind

9320.84 --> 9325.8
of predict it but still it just sucks

9375.96 --> 9382.679999999998
repent I doubt it Optimus he doesn't

9378.8 --> 9385.0
even like that it's more of like a

9382.68 --> 9387.720000000001
Buddhist no I think he's just not going

9385.0 --> 9387.72
to show up

9390.6 --> 9396.52
again maybe in like half a year or

9393.319 --> 9400.68
something I mean he just he did this on

9396.52 --> 9400.68
purpose I know he did

9438.64 --> 9441.519999999999
d

9465.76 --> 9471.72
all right anyway I really hope God

9468.12 --> 9476.319000000001
forgives us forgiv me forgive me for

9471.72 --> 9476.319
this attitude I wish to

9481.64 --> 9488.119999999999
repent I mean the video from Greg ree

9485.24 --> 9492.319
was really good really

9488.12 --> 9495.479000000001
informative at Great points

9492.319 --> 9499.88
it I want to repent I want

9495.479 --> 9502.84
to just get out of this I want to do it

9499.88 --> 9502.839999999998
right I want to do it

9505.12 --> 9511.92
better I'm got to figure out what my

9507.68 --> 9516.68
weaknesses are that enable things to

9511.92 --> 9516.68
work like this to go bad like

9521.2 --> 9525.640000000001
this I want to do it right I want to be

9523.76 --> 9529.279
better I want to have a better show I

9525.64 --> 9531.0
mean it's not that incredibly hard to

9529.279 --> 9533.359
just just have a Daily Show there is

9531.0 --> 9537.399
plenty of people that do it

9533.359 --> 9537.399000000001
and they don't create

9542.72 --> 9548.76
wreckage but I don't know maybe I just

9545.04 --> 9552.160000000002
have to have shorter shows and then just

9548.76 --> 9554.04
like push it more and have it shorter I

9552.16 --> 9555.96
mean that's kind of automatically what

9554.04 --> 9558.399000000001
happens during the night owl shows but

9555.96 --> 9562.358999999999
those are great they're shorter but

9558.399 --> 9562.358999999999
they're great for

9599.439 --> 9603.92
and I should probably figure out

9601.24 --> 9608.24
something to just dive into a new

9603.92 --> 9608.24
subject a new research

9616.2 --> 9620.2
item no

9618.08 --> 9624.2
duper I don't don't want to get into

9620.2 --> 9624.2
that anymore if you don't

9648.24 --> 9652.279
mind for

9690.76 --> 9696.24
M Muhammed no it's not another story

9693.319 --> 9696.24
it's the same

9697.6 --> 9701.68
nonsense I don't want to get into

9708.24 --> 9712.199999999999
that for

9752.8 --> 9759.8
it's only about marage yeah

9755.399 --> 9759.8
exactly that's right

9785.16 --> 9790.039999999999
right so yeah just going to have to get

9787.88 --> 9792.519999999999
to bed

9790.04 --> 9794.960000000001
earlier figure out maybe I'm just going

9792.52 --> 9797.319000000001
to make some notes and like here is

9794.96 --> 9800.56
something that I'm going to talk

9797.319 --> 9803.72
about and when I'm done talking about it

9800.56 --> 9807.119999999999
I'm going to round out the show and [ __ ]

9803.72 --> 9810.278999999999
the [ __ ] chat cuz it's just there to

9807.12 --> 9814.68
waste my time bring up nonsense subject

9810.279 --> 9814.68
stupid [ __ ] Sports horse

9814.8 --> 9822.24
[ __ ] it's not interesting at

9818.24 --> 9825.08
all and I'm going to just ignore it just

9822.24 --> 9827.6
have a relatively short show talking

9825.08 --> 9829.479
about some subjects and then rounding

9827.6 --> 9831.6
out

9829.479 --> 9834.76
cuz nobody's going to [ __ ] show up

9831.6 --> 9837.6
and actually help just make the

9834.76 --> 9839.84
show asking good questions bringing in

9837.6 --> 9843.0
interesting

9839.84 --> 9847.68
subjects commenting about what is talked

9843.0 --> 9847.68
about nobody does that anymore here

9847.92 --> 9854.399
apparently or you all show up like two

9850.88 --> 9854.399
hours after I already

9854.56 --> 9861.039999999999
started

9856.16 --> 9861.039999999999
so yeah I'm just going to do that then

9867.88 --> 9874.08
going to have very very short Early Bird

9871.279 --> 9877.399000000001
shows like I'm actually let's just do it

9874.08 --> 9880.76
like one hour early bird shows I'm going

9877.399 --> 9884.119999999999
to have that one hour just one hour and

9880.76 --> 9884.12
then I'm probably going to round it

9886.64 --> 9894.08
out that's how I'm going to do it from

9888.8 --> 9894.08
now on no more three-hour shows it's

9896.64 --> 9903.319
over going to be short shows from now on

9899.92 --> 9906.8
because nobody gives a [ __ ] and so there

9903.319 --> 9906.8
will be very short shows

9907.439 --> 9911.92
then yeah and then nobody shows up

9910.359 --> 9915.319
because everybody thinks you can just

9911.92 --> 9918.24
show up two hours late now not blaming

9915.319 --> 9920.96
anybody hyper specifically right now

9918.24 --> 9920.96
that's a general

9923.359 --> 9928.6
accusation so but with that note I am

9926.6 --> 9930.800000000001
going to round out so thanks everyone
