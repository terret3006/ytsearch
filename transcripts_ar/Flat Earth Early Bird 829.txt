86.479 --> 90.0
just kind of grayish soup

90.799 --> 95.60000000000001
and well before i did kind of see the

94.079 --> 99.27999999999999
sun

95.6 --> 103.119
gazing through it like a little white

99.28 --> 106.24
gas lamp in the fog

103.119 --> 108.079
but yeah there's not really a lot of uh

106.24 --> 115.83999999999999
sunlight coming through but there is a

108.079 --> 115.83999999999999
plenty still around from the scattering

116.159 --> 124.24000000000001

119.84 --> 124.24000000000001
so right

125.36 --> 133.28
but i'm a little late

129.28 --> 134.08
because i had like yeah judicial issues

133.28 --> 138.319
to work through

134.08 --> 142.56
in the last two hours

138.319 --> 146.16
yeah two and a half hours roughly and

142.56 --> 150.8
that did work out decently

146.16 --> 154.64
i'll elaborate maybe a little but anyway

161.599 --> 174.16
the 10th of march 2021

171.12 --> 176.16
i got green tea here but yeah i

174.16 --> 178.319
was kind of in a hurry to make it all in

176.16 --> 180.56
the last 15 minutes so i still have to

178.319 --> 183.44
put the tea bag in there

180.56 --> 185.76
but at the same time i also got a well a

183.44 --> 190.0
bonus coffee

185.76 --> 192.239
because i felt like one again

190.0 --> 194.8
i was very nervous this morning for my

192.239 --> 194.8
appointment

196.8 --> 204.31900000000002
and now i uh yeah now i got over that

200.0 --> 204.319
and now i just want a fresh new coffee

206.799 --> 212.799
huh hello father son child what youtube

210.0 --> 215.599
keeps unsubbing you

212.799 --> 215.59900000000002
that's freaky

216.959 --> 221.68
huh okay well if that's happening then

221.76 --> 227.67999999999998
if yeah if you can just go to my channel

225.28 --> 229.76
during well 1 pm amsterdam time in the

227.68 --> 230.87900000000002
weekday and 2 pm amsterdam time in the

229.76 --> 235.519
weekend

230.879 --> 237.35999999999999
and most of the time i should be there

235.519 --> 241.84
but yeah that's a bit annoying that

237.36 --> 241.84
youtube keeps on serving me

244.879 --> 248.56
if it gets really bad what you could

246.799 --> 252.48000000000002
potentially do is just

248.56 --> 254.72
bookmark my home channel

252.48 --> 255.76
the link to the yeah the base channel

254.72 --> 257.359
link

255.76 --> 259.199
to my channel and just put it in the

257.359 --> 262.079
bookmark you know they can't

259.199 --> 262.079
remove that

264.479 --> 270.71999999999997
but anyway thanks for uh for popping by

273.52 --> 283.84
oh let me get my notes they're still in

276.4 --> 283.84
the bag

305.84 --> 310.88
sent a complaint to youtube okay okay

308.96 --> 312.56
you could yeah you could do that

310.88 --> 314.32
i don't know if they're gonna respond to

312.56 --> 317.36
it ever though

314.32 --> 319.68
because they they don't like people

317.36 --> 323.039
subscribing to me they like people to

319.68 --> 325.68
just kind of forget that i'm around

323.039 --> 326.8
you know maybe they're riding on the

325.68 --> 330.40000000000003
fact that they

326.8 --> 331.36
dude do a daily show and that people

330.4 --> 333.52
will have the attitude

331.36 --> 335.28000000000003
of like oh yeah he's doing a daily show

333.52 --> 336.96
but then they kind of forget to check it

335.28 --> 338.35999999999996
out and they don't get notifications

336.96 --> 340.56
anymore because they're secretly

338.36 --> 344.639
unsubscribed

340.56 --> 345.84
somehow technical difficulties or

344.639 --> 348.8
whatever right

345.84 --> 350.08
anyway despite all that i do have a few

348.8 --> 354.24
subscribers

350.08 --> 357.039
i think thanks to nathan's promotion

354.24 --> 358.72
of me yesterday on the flat earth early

357.039 --> 364.479
bird show

358.72 --> 367.03900000000004
because i now have instead of 1850

364.479 --> 368.31899999999996
subscribers i seem to have 1870

367.039 --> 370.24
subscribers so

368.319 --> 373.52000000000004
i did get a couple of new subscribers

370.24 --> 375.919
and i do appreciate that

373.52 --> 378.79999999999995
do keep track though if you actually

375.919 --> 382.56
want to watch my shows which are daily

378.8 --> 385.28000000000003
because well as father stolen child said

382.56 --> 385.84
youtube has a tendency sometimes to just

385.28 --> 389.19899999999996
unsub

385.84 --> 389.19899999999996
you without telling you

392.0 --> 395.84
missing the esteemed presence of dr

394.56 --> 398.96
gonzo

395.84 --> 400.57
well i don't miss him at all

398.96 --> 403.19899999999996
god

400.57 --> 406.15999999999997
[Music]

403.199 --> 409.84000000000003
no i'm done with ballers for a while i'm

406.16 --> 409.84000000000003
i'm really done with it

415.44 --> 419.28
you know i'd rather deal with father

417.28 --> 422.0
stone child john

419.28 --> 423.44
i'd rather deal with him he was a baller

422.0 --> 426.639
not too long ago

423.44 --> 428.4
and then he figured it out

426.639 --> 430.72
right all these people hanging around

428.4 --> 433.52
the chat they had plenty of time

430.72 --> 434.24
they had plenty of time to get there and

433.52 --> 436.15999999999997
they didn't

434.24 --> 437.759
they just doubled down on terrible

436.16 --> 441.759
behavior almost like

437.759 --> 446.08000000000004
waiting for people to remind them

441.759 --> 446.08000000000004
and then they get a little extra nasty

449.52 --> 457.599
and yeah i just don't want that that's a

453.919 --> 461.84
very dark anti-social unnatural

457.599 --> 461.84
inhuman stance to take

462.319 --> 465.759
it is it is the stance of a religious

464.639 --> 467.759
fanatic whether you

465.759 --> 470.8
accept that you're religious or not is

467.759 --> 472.56
completely irrelevant to that fact

470.8 --> 474.879
if you're just going to have a certain

472.56 --> 478.56
attitude and then act nice

474.879 --> 482.40000000000003
but when confronted with logical facts

478.56 --> 485.919
you get nasty right

482.4 --> 490.87899999999996
that's very classifiable as religious

485.919 --> 490.87899999999996
associated behavior yeah

491.44 --> 496.16
and i don't need that i do want

493.599 --> 500.24
open-minded people though

496.16 --> 503.59900000000005
and hey especially science fiction fans

500.24 --> 503.599
because i am one myself

504.16 --> 512.0
you know i i i've never really

509.36 --> 512.8000000000001
felt too much sympathy for flat earthers

512.0 --> 516.24
i would say no

512.8 --> 517.76
just erase it all and fire nasa and put

516.24 --> 520.8
them in jail and just

517.76 --> 523.919
get it get rid of it erase it from media

520.8 --> 525.4399999999999
no don't do that

523.919 --> 528.48
i think that would be extremely

525.44 --> 528.48
dangerous to do

530.88 --> 538.8
i think if we do that the demon

534.959 --> 541.92
slumbering within the believers

538.8 --> 545.279
over the generations will suddenly peak

541.92 --> 548.959
and they will turn quite evil

545.279 --> 550.56
like very very evil if we ever would

548.959 --> 552.8
consider doing such a thing

550.56 --> 554.7199999999999
like if they we truly would take away

552.8 --> 556.3199999999999
their ball not in their mind but in the

554.72 --> 559.9200000000001
world

556.32 --> 562.08
we it get messed up

559.92 --> 564.3199999999999
because they're religious fanatics and

562.08 --> 567.76
religious fanatics when pushed enough

564.32 --> 569.6
will literally murder people for it

567.76 --> 572.48
and i think that there are ballers out

569.6 --> 574.72
there that they get pushed enough

572.48 --> 577.2
and then when they get a signal from

574.72 --> 579.76
somewhere that it's supposed to be okay

577.2 --> 582.1600000000001
justified for some reason they'll just

579.76 --> 582.16
do it

583.44 --> 587.12
right but i don't have any empirical

585.68 --> 588.7199999999999
proof for that because it hasn't

587.12 --> 592.5600000000001
happened yet

588.72 --> 594.24
not that i can prove right

592.56 --> 605.8389999999999
but it does happen with religious

594.24 --> 605.839
fanatics in general

612.64 --> 619.8389999999999
nasa keeps the baller contained

615.76 --> 619.8389999999999
that's how ironic you would call it that

626.64 --> 632.3199999999999
yeah nasa

629.76 --> 634.64
forms the container that prevents the

632.32 --> 647.839
ballers from being sucked off into the

634.64 --> 647.8389999999999
vacuum of outer space

653.12 --> 655.839
good to see you

658.0 --> 663.36
what inquisition i think that

661.2 --> 664.24
father of stone i think the inquisition

663.36 --> 666.32
is not

664.24 --> 668.88
what we're being told it is at all i

666.32 --> 670.24
think the inquisition was a super heavy

668.88 --> 673.76
political

670.24 --> 676.0
attack to try and deepen the mental

673.76 --> 678.16
slavery of the public

676.0 --> 679.839
i don't think it was actually christian

678.16 --> 682.3199999999999
in any sort of way

679.839 --> 684.8800000000001
i think it was pure power pure power

682.32 --> 684.88
politics

686.959 --> 690.8
the original inquisition

691.44 --> 703.0400000000001
spanish one and all that it's just power

694.32 --> 705.7600000000001
power only

703.04 --> 706.88
would you categorize astral projection

705.76 --> 709.36
interdimensional

706.88 --> 709.36
travel

710.16 --> 713.92
as science fiction no

714.56 --> 718.6389999999999
people have those experiences that's not

717.2 --> 720.8000000000001
science fiction

718.639 --> 722.48
the experiences are not science fiction

720.8 --> 726.88
they're actual

722.48 --> 726.88
they're not fantasized they are

728.839 --> 731.839
experienced

735.279 --> 742.24
right fiction implies

739.04 --> 742.8
that it's not actually experienced it's

742.24 --> 745.839
just

742.8 --> 745.8389999999999
thought about

751.68 --> 756.0
so it isn't fiction then well it could

753.68 --> 758.16
be considered fiction to people that

756.0 --> 761.6
literally have never experienced and

758.16 --> 763.8389999999999
are not willing to

761.6 --> 773.839
entertain that it might actually be real

763.839 --> 777.2790000000001
in some way

773.839 --> 777.2790000000001
but doesn't mean that it is

780.8 --> 787.8389999999999
hey tom parker

793.279 --> 797.04
all right yeah yeah team mark yeah i

796.0 --> 801.839
know

797.04 --> 801.8389999999999
i thought i recognized the name

811.76 --> 816.16
out of body experiences debunk atheism i

815.2 --> 819.36
don't know how

816.16 --> 819.36
that would do that

822.48 --> 826.32
i don't think any experience debunks

825.6 --> 830.639
atheism

826.32 --> 830.639
i think atheism debunks atheism

831.839 --> 836.0790000000001
though there doesn't need to be anything

833.68 --> 838.8
external

836.079 --> 840.959
to debunk atheism you just look at what

838.8 --> 843.5999999999999
it actually says and claims

840.959 --> 844.88
and that is the debunk unless you're

843.6 --> 848.48
just too

844.88 --> 857.8389999999999
stupid and blinded willingly ignorant

848.48 --> 857.839
to recognize that

868.88 --> 877.36
does atheism deny spirituality no

873.279 --> 877.36
but it makes it completely illogical

879.6 --> 885.36
look atheism claims

882.639 --> 886.399
things designing themselves within

885.36 --> 888.639
nature

886.399 --> 899.839
that would include spirituality none of

888.639 --> 899.839
that makes any damn sense

900.88 --> 908.56
right atheism debunks itself

905.04 --> 913.8389999999999
through the sheer preponderance

908.56 --> 913.8389999999999
of claims that it makes

932.72 --> 941.839
all right so

936.639 --> 941.839
let's see if i registered

944.8 --> 947.92
yeah yesterday's flat earth early weird

946.639 --> 951.12
show was great

947.92 --> 951.12
i thought it was really awesome

952.399 --> 958.48
getting into better flow flat earth

955.279 --> 958.48
debates was also good

958.56 --> 963.199
and later in the evening there was a qe

961.04 --> 965.36
live and i was present with that

963.199 --> 966.4799999999999
in the second part of it i discovered it

965.36 --> 969.1990000000001
a little late

966.48 --> 970.9590000000001
i was watching infowars oh that was a

969.199 --> 974.24
weird part

970.959 --> 977.92
that was like weird because

974.24 --> 982.88
like paul joseph watson was like

977.92 --> 985.279
live on the show doing his thing

982.88 --> 988.32
you know how he does that and i kind of

985.279 --> 988.32
appreciate what he does

988.959 --> 996.3199999999999
but yeah yesterday he was

992.56 --> 999.4399999999999
literally wearing this sweater not well

996.32 --> 1002.88
not literally this sweater but

999.44 --> 1002.8800000000001
exactly that type

1003.199 --> 1008.8389999999999
and yeah it seemed like it was a little

1005.759 --> 1011.6800000000001
dirty i think he had some dandruff or

1008.839 --> 1013.839
something that kind of stood out

1011.68 --> 1015.279
that was a bit weird so i kept on

1013.839 --> 1019.12
staring like dude

1015.279 --> 1019.12
why are you wearing my sweater

1022.839 --> 1025.839
uh

1028.959 --> 1036.8390000000002
yeah that's very cute opus dei

1032.559 --> 1039.839
it's very very cute science fiction

1036.839 --> 1039.839
claim

1050.559 --> 1058.6399999999999
uh sahaz dubey i

1054.0 --> 1060.96
i didn't think that behind a book curve

1058.64 --> 1062.96
documentary on netflix was really great

1060.96 --> 1066.4
at proving flat earth

1062.96 --> 1067.679
it was manipulated it put together in a

1066.4 --> 1070.96
very manipulative

1067.679 --> 1074.0
fashion by the uh

1070.96 --> 1074.64
by the producers but what it did do

1074.0 --> 1077.6
however

1074.64 --> 1080.16
the function that it did have is

1077.6 --> 1083.28
exposing people

1080.16 --> 1085.679
to flat earth in some way even if just

1083.28 --> 1086.72
in a sort of ridiculing way it exposes

1085.679 --> 1089.039
people

1086.72 --> 1089.76
when you ask people now they have heard

1089.039 --> 1092.32
of it

1089.76 --> 1094.72
there's a chance when you speak to a

1092.32 --> 1097.2
random person when you say oh flat earth

1094.72 --> 1098.559
that they actually heard of behind the

1097.2 --> 1102.0
curve

1098.559 --> 1104.32
right that's the function not that

1102.0 --> 1107.039
the movie proves the earth is flat it's

1104.32 --> 1110.48
actually put together quite lame

1107.039 --> 1110.48
quite pointless in many ways

1110.559 --> 1116.799
but it just exposes

1113.84 --> 1117.6789999999999
a wider audience to the knowledge that

1116.799 --> 1120.6399999999999
there is

1117.679 --> 1122.0
such a thing now people have something

1120.64 --> 1125.1200000000001
to reference

1122.0 --> 1127.52
as a vantage point when somebody asks

1125.12 --> 1129.12
right so it definitely does have a

1127.52 --> 1131.2
function

1129.12 --> 1132.32
that function however is not to prove

1131.2 --> 1134.72
the earth is flat

1132.32 --> 1137.84
because the documentary was not put

1134.72 --> 1137.84
together like that

1137.919 --> 1142.72
it was more about flat earthers and what

1140.32 --> 1142.72
we do

1147.919 --> 1155.8400000000001
those are the founders of what founders

1152.08 --> 1156.559
who's founder of flat earth what what is

1155.84 --> 1159.6789999999999
that

1156.559 --> 1161.28
what a founder of a flat earth are you

1159.679 --> 1164.4
saying

1161.28 --> 1168.32
like it's a religion and somebody found

1164.4 --> 1171.039
creates the foundation no

1168.32 --> 1172.24
flat earth doesn't have a founder flat

1171.039 --> 1176.84
earth has people that

1172.24 --> 1179.84
realize it there's no

1176.84 --> 1179.84
founder

1197.52 --> 1207.84
[ __ ] you grimy

1211.28 --> 1221.84
the fe society tmh

1215.039 --> 1221.84
who the hell is tmh

1236.96 --> 1242.0
and sahaja dubai i don't know what your

1239.2 --> 1242.0
main account is

1245.039 --> 1249.84
the most high what is that

1250.08 --> 1253.84
this is all wrong what you're saying is

1252.24 --> 1255.84
just stupid

1253.84 --> 1257.6789999999999
creator did not found a flat earth

1255.84 --> 1260.8799999999999
society the flatter society is a

1257.679 --> 1265.6000000000001
controlled opposition

1260.88 --> 1268.96
group grounded in the freemasons

1265.6 --> 1277.84
very blatantly definitely not

1268.96 --> 1277.8400000000001
created by the creator

1294.32 --> 1299.6789999999999
oh shirak patel mark sergeant teaching

1297.2 --> 1299.679
the v

1299.76 --> 1305.84
markup whatever man

1309.6 --> 1314.9599999999998
yeah opus dei not the flat earth society

1316.84 --> 1319.84
though

1327.84 --> 1332.08
i saw i've never seen that and i'm

1330.32 --> 1347.84
pretty damn sure i've never banned that

1332.08 --> 1347.84
it's a weird thing to say that

1353.12 --> 1361.84
but i'll just check it to be sure

1370.32 --> 1377.12
oh wait yeah oh you were okay

1374.24 --> 1377.1200000000001
i'll take it out

1377.52 --> 1380.6399999999999
be sure to behave

1381.6 --> 1389.84
all right

1400.84 --> 1403.84
okay

1417.2 --> 1420.159
yours as well

1421.36 --> 1425.36
why how did you get banned in the first

1428.84 --> 1431.84
place

1458.08 --> 1473.84
okay so opus d what is your account

1461.679 --> 1473.8400000000001
then or the original one

1483.679 --> 1492.4
oh it's you no no you're just banned

1487.84 --> 1501.84
you need to go away and don't come back

1492.4 --> 1501.8400000000001
i don't want you here anymore

1512.84 --> 1515.84
so

1526.84 --> 1529.84
ugh

1580.88 --> 1585.8400000000001
come on

1587.44 --> 1592.0800000000002
trying to get this damn camera centered

1596.96 --> 1613.8400000000001
yeah john i think you're probably right

1600.48 --> 1613.84
it's kind of annoying

1623.2 --> 1627.8400000000001
right anyway uh

1628.08 --> 1632.48
oh man i'm running out of south park

1634.88 --> 1638.24
that's something that stood out

1638.84 --> 1644.72
yesterday

1641.679 --> 1646.5590000000002
like i'm already in like season 22. damn

1644.72 --> 1648.72
how that how quick that went

1646.559 --> 1649.6789999999999
i thought at the beginning was like oh

1648.72 --> 1653.2
my god it's

1649.679 --> 1656.72
infinite there's so much of it well

1653.2 --> 1658.3990000000001
not anymore uh

1656.72 --> 1661.3600000000001
although i did see that there is

1658.399 --> 1663.84
apparently a new season coming

1661.36 --> 1665.76
pretty soon in the netherlands it's

1663.84 --> 1668.9599999999998
supposed to be airing the set

1665.76 --> 1673.12
the 17th and it's a picture of

1668.96 --> 1676.799
yeah the south park kids wearing masks

1673.12 --> 1679.36
so that's very telling but still good

1676.799 --> 1681.76
that despite everything south park is

1679.36 --> 1682.24
continuing it should continue i want to

1681.76 --> 1684.08
see

1682.24 --> 1685.919
new south park episodes when i'm

1684.08 --> 1689.12
freaking 80 years old

1685.919 --> 1690.159
it should go on forever it could if the

1689.12 --> 1694.08
makers

1690.159 --> 1696.3990000000001
can can actually keep up the level

1694.08 --> 1697.9189999999999
that they've maintained so far with the

1696.399 --> 1700.1589999999999
series

1697.919 --> 1703.44
i really think it is probably overall

1700.159 --> 1707.44
the best cartoon series i've ever seen

1703.44 --> 1707.919
it really is because it just the impact

1707.44 --> 1710.799
is

1707.919 --> 1711.279
phenomenal it's not even cultural

1710.799 --> 1714.559
anymore

1711.279 --> 1717.2
it's just like really

1714.559 --> 1717.2
important

1720.0 --> 1728.08
you can learn so much from it

1725.36 --> 1732.24
ah my best flat earth proof well the

1728.08 --> 1734.96
entire lack of curvature for starters

1732.24 --> 1736.96
horizon always raises to slightly below

1734.96 --> 1738.96
eye level and then doesn't continue

1736.96 --> 1742.799
dropping

1738.96 --> 1746.559
and the black swan observation extreme

1742.799 --> 1747.12
far sights at extremely low observation

1746.559 --> 1749.039
heights

1747.12 --> 1750.799
which should be a geometric

1749.039 --> 1752.8799999999999
impossibility if the earth was a

1750.799 --> 1755.039
geometrical sphere

1752.88 --> 1757.919
and then of course the the biggest one

1755.039 --> 1760.0
is the gas pressure

1757.919 --> 1762.159
the i the notion that gas is going to

1760.0 --> 1764.0
stick to a ball because of a

1762.159 --> 1766.0
presumed force that's not actually a

1764.0 --> 1768.399
force but you can think of it as a force

1766.0 --> 1770.159
and if you do it's a weak force and it

1768.399 --> 1772.799
would have to oppose

1770.159 --> 1774.72
the power of gas pressure expansion

1772.799 --> 1776.799
within the available volume which

1774.72 --> 1778.64
is presumed to be infinite which would

1776.799 --> 1781.76
make it an infinite

1778.64 --> 1783.039
power infinite force of gas pressure

1781.76 --> 1786.0
expansion which the

1783.039 --> 1787.76
weak presumed force that's not actually

1786.0 --> 1790.399
a force of gravity

1787.76 --> 1792.399
could never counter right so gas

1790.399 --> 1794.6399999999999
pressure is probably

1792.399 --> 1796.399
the most glaring proof that the

1794.64 --> 1799.5200000000002
heliocentric setup is

1796.399 --> 1803.1999999999998
absolutely impossible no matter

1799.52 --> 1806.96
what no matter what absolutely

1803.2 --> 1810.0800000000002
impossible no matter what right

1806.96 --> 1813.679
so those two elements are the strongest

1810.08 --> 1814.48
in my opinion now of course the earth

1813.679 --> 1817.44
spin

1814.48 --> 1819.279
is an issue oh it's stationary oh but

1817.44 --> 1820.559
it's spinning it's moving in lockstep

1819.279 --> 1822.159
and this thing is spinning but that

1820.559 --> 1823.9189999999999
thing is not spinning well it just leads

1822.159 --> 1826.7990000000002
to globiolus

1823.919 --> 1829.3600000000001
as brian called it coriolis confusion

1826.799 --> 1831.2
it's just annoying to get stuck in that

1829.36 --> 1833.1999999999998
and it's kind of a side note whether the

1831.2 --> 1835.52
earth is spinning or not

1833.2 --> 1836.96
when it's blatantly obvious it's not a

1835.52 --> 1839.44
ball in the first place

1836.96 --> 1841.44
and it's definitely not an and it's not

1839.44 --> 1842.96
surrounded by an endless volume of outer

1841.44 --> 1846.0
space

1842.96 --> 1851.8400000000001
those two elements are the most glaring

1846.0 --> 1851.84
glaring evidence

1859.919 --> 1864.0
oh with pressure yeah graded yeah

1862.84 --> 1867.9189999999999
gradients

1864.0 --> 1870.799
form secondary secondary

1867.919 --> 1872.3990000000001
first it the gas will keep on expanding

1870.799 --> 1875.9189999999999
in all directions to fill

1872.399 --> 1879.279
the volume available to it

1875.919 --> 1882.3200000000002
unless that volume available to it

1879.279 --> 1885.84
is limited by a container

1882.32 --> 1889.2
wall blockade that would be

1885.84 --> 1892.32
sufficient to stop the gas from

1889.2 --> 1895.3600000000001
expanding further

1892.32 --> 1898.24
and then once yeah once that equilibrium

1895.36 --> 1900.799
with the container has been found

1898.24 --> 1902.799
and the gas basically stops violently

1900.799 --> 1905.36
expanding in all directions

1902.799 --> 1907.36
because it has filled the volume then

1905.36 --> 1909.279
yeah whatever gas

1907.36 --> 1910.6399999999999
how it is distributed within the

1909.279 --> 1913.919
container that's

1910.64 --> 1916.96
things can happen to that so

1913.919 --> 1919.6000000000001
relative density may have an influence

1916.96 --> 1921.1200000000001
heat being introduced at ground level

1919.6 --> 1923.1999999999998
may have an influence

1921.12 --> 1924.399
maybe there's a cooling influence as

1923.2 --> 1927.2
well really high up

1924.399 --> 1928.399
all these influences will definitely

1927.2 --> 1931.919
cause

1928.399 --> 1934.399
the gas to not eq be stay

1931.919 --> 1936.5590000000002
equally spread out within the volume of

1934.399 --> 1940.0
the container

1936.559 --> 1943.12
but that's only because it has

1940.0 --> 1945.76
finished spreading out within the

1943.12 --> 1949.279
available volume of the container

1945.76 --> 1950.8799999999999
if it would not finish spreading out

1949.279 --> 1953.279
within the available volume of the

1950.88 --> 1955.679
container which is the presumed setup

1953.279 --> 1957.519
of heliocentrism with an endless volume

1955.679 --> 1958.72
of outer space surrounding the bald

1957.519 --> 1962.159
earth

1958.72 --> 1963.76
then no gradient could ever form because

1962.159 --> 1966.48
the gas is too busy

1963.76 --> 1967.44
violently expanding in all directions in

1966.48 --> 1970.559
order to

1967.44 --> 1972.72
form any kind of gradient it's too busy

1970.559 --> 1975.6
to even push against

1972.72 --> 1978.08
neighboring gas molecules that are

1975.6 --> 1980.6399999999999
expanding in all directions as well

1978.08 --> 1981.519
right can't do that no gradient could

1980.64 --> 1985.3600000000001
ever form

1981.519 --> 1991.84
unless unless the gas

1985.36 --> 1991.84
has filled the available volume

2000.799 --> 2005.36
oh we got a couple of delusional people

2003.279 --> 2008.32
in chat here

2005.36 --> 2011.6789999999999
low sleeping warrior not one of those

2008.32 --> 2011.6789999999999
delusional people by the way

2012.48 --> 2016.0
although you really have to bring that

2014.399 --> 2020.0
up

2016.0 --> 2032.799
typical ah hey

2020.0 --> 2034.96
mandy young

2032.799 --> 2036.8799999999999
how can you measure a refractorizing

2034.96 --> 2038.32
with the theology

2036.88 --> 2040.64
well they don't really measure the

2038.32 --> 2045.6
horizon though

2040.64 --> 2047.6000000000001
they just use it as an orientation right

2045.6 --> 2048.96
don't measure the horizon they just use

2047.6 --> 2054.159
it as an orientation

2048.96 --> 2054.159
like it has to line up kind of that's it

2058.96 --> 2062.96
yeah refraction doesn't really play into

2072.839 --> 2075.839
that

2075.919 --> 2084.48
theodolites prove the horizon drop

2080.079 --> 2088.2400000000002
in a ratio oh really

2084.48 --> 2091.599
it really does it now i don't think so

2088.24 --> 2092.9599999999996
it what does the other lights have to do

2091.599 --> 2095.9190000000003
with horizon

2092.96 --> 2096.48
dropping right are you trying to say

2095.919 --> 2099.5989999999997
that the

2096.48 --> 2103.119
lights are being utilized with

2099.599 --> 2104.0
heights i don't think so i think the odd

2103.119 --> 2107.119
lights are

2104.0 --> 2111.68
used horizontally

2107.119 --> 2115.04
to map out the local terrain

2111.68 --> 2116.64
oriented you don't you don't take a

2115.04 --> 2118.88
theater light

2116.64 --> 2120.0
as a standard practice and then go in an

2118.88 --> 2121.92
elevator

2120.0 --> 2125.04
and see if it still matches that's not

2121.92 --> 2128.32
what you use theodolites for

2125.04 --> 2128.64
this is so very cute that you suggest

2128.32 --> 2130.7200000000003
that

2128.64 --> 2133.359
except that's not what fiat lights are

2130.72 --> 2135.5989999999997
being used for

2133.359 --> 2145.839
so you literally just made that up out

2135.599 --> 2145.839
of nowhere

2156.839 --> 2159.839
hmm

2168.16 --> 2172.0
if it were refracted you couldn't

2170.16 --> 2174.56
measure angular

2172.0 --> 2177.04
relationships to the stars oh come on

2174.56 --> 2179.68
don't remind them about that

2177.04 --> 2180.48
this just makes it too complicated

2179.68 --> 2182.64
they're already

2180.48 --> 2184.839
refining the celestial lights into

2182.64 --> 2186.3199999999997
supposed physical objects at vast

2184.839 --> 2188.96
distances

2186.32 --> 2190.96
don't remind them of the natural

2188.96 --> 2193.119
consequences of it all

2190.96 --> 2194.8
they just say uh celestial refraction

2193.119 --> 2195.6800000000003
it's separate from terrestrial

2194.8 --> 2199.04
refraction

2195.68 --> 2203.359
that's just what they say yes

2199.04 --> 2207.119
xyz you can use it

2203.359 --> 2210.16
it's not what it's used for

2207.119 --> 2213.04
though maybe you should listen

2210.16 --> 2229.839
to when i actually respond to something

2213.04 --> 2229.839
you type in chat

2238.079 --> 2243.2000000000003
oh look professor phil bell in chat

2241.44 --> 2245.28
[Music]

2243.2 --> 2246.64
look at all the down votes oh they don't

2245.28 --> 2248.96
like it

2246.64 --> 2249.839
see this happens every time for anybody

2248.96 --> 2252.2400000000002
watching this

2249.839 --> 2254.4
watching me in my show right looks

2252.24 --> 2256.64
pretty cool right

2254.4 --> 2258.56
it's a pretty cool layout right and i'm

2256.64 --> 2261.2
a decent speaker

2258.56 --> 2263.92
clear enough i have a good mastery

2261.2 --> 2268.24
language so this constant

2263.92 --> 2271.76
barraging of votes is purely political

2268.24 --> 2275.2799999999997
it's political rigging to

2271.76 --> 2278.88
kind of screw around

2275.28 --> 2280.8
with statistics because people

2278.88 --> 2282.32
on the ball side that have gotten to

2280.8 --> 2285.599
know me they can't

2282.32 --> 2289.92
afford me to somehow

2285.599 --> 2295.04
stand out because i'm way

2289.92 --> 2298.4
way too good at what i do right

2295.04 --> 2301.599
i am technically extremely proficient in

2298.4 --> 2305.04
clarifying physical

2301.599 --> 2305.839
facts and natural consequences like no

2305.04 --> 2308.0
other

2305.839 --> 2309.44
i'm better at it than nathan oakley you

2308.0 --> 2314.32
hear me nathan

2309.44 --> 2317.2000000000003
now you're better at mauling ballers

2314.32 --> 2318.2400000000002
and just doing that you're better at

2317.2 --> 2320.56
trashing ballers

2318.24 --> 2322.3199999999997
right that's that's your thing and you

2320.56 --> 2325.68
are extremely proficient

2322.32 --> 2326.079
right you were proficient i basically

2325.68 --> 2329.44
follow

2326.079 --> 2332.6400000000003
your proficiency at it you started that

2329.44 --> 2335.44
i follow up but i refine

2332.64 --> 2337.7599999999998
what i do a lot more that's also why it

2335.44 --> 2340.8
takes a little longer

2337.76 --> 2344.32
and yeah people on the ball side that

2340.8 --> 2345.3590000000004
know me they fear me so they have to

2344.32 --> 2347.599
downvote me

2345.359 --> 2348.4
it's just like the whole political

2347.599 --> 2352.079
situation

2348.4 --> 2354.8
out there supposed left wing right wing

2352.079 --> 2355.8390000000004
the left wing are [ __ ] their pants

2354.8 --> 2358.8
so badly

2355.839 --> 2360.88
every time some right-wing guy just says

2358.8 --> 2362.2400000000002
a basic thing about common sense that

2360.88 --> 2364.6400000000003
they have to literally

2362.24 --> 2366.3999999999996
stalk them and barrage them with

2364.64 --> 2368.3199999999997
negative publicity

2366.4 --> 2369.76
because they are just [ __ ] their

2368.32 --> 2372.7200000000003
pants every time

2369.76 --> 2375.2000000000003
a right-wing person has the gall to say

2372.72 --> 2377.1189999999997
something that is basic common sense

2375.2 --> 2380.7999999999997
right same thing is kind of happening to

2377.119 --> 2383.76
me except this is not politics

2380.8 --> 2386.1600000000003
it's cosmogeny it's philosophy this is a

2383.76 --> 2387.119
philosophical struggle we're engaging

2386.16 --> 2390.64
with

2387.119 --> 2393.119
flat earth versus heliocentric globe

2390.64 --> 2394.8799999999997
and it's pretty much the same situation

2393.119 --> 2398.0
so they pile it on

2394.88 --> 2400.2400000000002
just like the politicians and their

2398.0 --> 2403.28
minions do

2400.24 --> 2407.9199999999996
you're just as dirty you're just

2403.28 --> 2410.48
as evil as they are

2407.92 --> 2412.4
because guess what flat earthers don't

2410.48 --> 2415.2
do this [ __ ]

2412.4 --> 2417.44
we don't do this we don't go to baller

2415.2 --> 2419.9199999999996
channels that talk absolute garbage all

2417.44 --> 2422.0
day long don't really have any content

2419.92 --> 2423.76
we might comment on it a little and

2422.0 --> 2425.92
we're especially gonna record

2423.76 --> 2427.92
numpty clips because if you say

2425.92 --> 2431.76
something really stupid

2427.92 --> 2436.2400000000002
mechanically insufficient mechanically

2431.76 --> 2438.079
inept right not about personal life just

2436.24 --> 2439.839
something you're saying about physics or

2438.079 --> 2440.079
reality yeah then we're going to record

2439.839 --> 2442.16
it

2440.079 --> 2443.8390000000004
and make fun of it right well you could

2442.16 --> 2445.839
do that too every time i'm a little

2443.839 --> 2446.48
pissed off oh yeah look around oh all

2445.839 --> 2448.64
the ballers

2446.48 --> 2451.839
oh they have arwin clips oh irwin is oh

2448.64 --> 2455.04
look at how out of control he is

2451.839 --> 2458.72
because that's all you can do

2455.04 --> 2460.64
you don't have any facts to back you up

2458.72 --> 2461.5989999999997
you just have a lot of stories a lot of

2460.64 --> 2467.2799999999997
peer pressure

2461.599 --> 2472.0
and a lot of terrible terrible behavior

2467.28 --> 2475.3590000000004
really nasty anti-social behavior

2472.0 --> 2479.839
that is kind of beyond bullying

2475.359 --> 2482.4
right but yeah bullying is not addressed

2479.839 --> 2484.48
in this scene because it's too much for

2482.4 --> 2488.0
everyone

2484.48 --> 2490.0
like people that complain about bullying

2488.0 --> 2492.96
let's say like oh you're a really

2490.0 --> 2494.24
nice leftist you want to defend people

2492.96 --> 2495.839
against bullying

2494.24 --> 2498.24
understandable there is bullying going

2495.839 --> 2502.0
around especially in schools can happen

2498.24 --> 2504.4799999999996
can get really nasty right well

2502.0 --> 2506.0
nobody gives a [ __ ] about bullying here

2504.48 --> 2509.04
on flat earth

2506.0 --> 2512.48
when you know flat earthers

2509.04 --> 2516.48
literally get stalked and

2512.48 --> 2519.52
threatened by people

2516.48 --> 2522.2400000000002
and even like people

2519.52 --> 2522.72
figuring oh he's a flat earther let's

2522.24 --> 2526.0
get

2522.72 --> 2527.839
him fired from his job yeah

2526.0 --> 2529.2
nobody's talking about that nobody's

2527.839 --> 2531.52
defending us

2529.2 --> 2532.3999999999996
because this is just too harsh so

2531.52 --> 2535.28
bullying

2532.4 --> 2537.44
apparently is completely okay on this

2535.28 --> 2541.119
scene

2537.44 --> 2544.64
because they can't handle it

2541.119 --> 2545.119
right oh bullying oh tiny wumbo is

2544.64 --> 2548.64
nathan

2545.119 --> 2552.7200000000003
bullying is he is he bullying people

2548.64 --> 2555.52
that come on his show voluntarily

2552.72 --> 2556.16
now that's not bullying that's people

2555.52 --> 2559.28
coming

2556.16 --> 2562.24
in the show and then making a complete

2559.28 --> 2562.96
ass of themselves and nathan holding

2562.24 --> 2566.3999999999996
their feet

2562.96 --> 2569.599
to the fire over it those people can

2566.4 --> 2572.0
literally leave instantly

2569.599 --> 2572.96
with a click of a button they don't do

2572.0 --> 2576.319
it

2572.96 --> 2577.119
that's not bullying right a bully

2576.319 --> 2579.2799999999997
corners you

2577.119 --> 2583.76
a bully ensures that you can't get away

2579.28 --> 2586.4
a bully gets in your private life

2583.76 --> 2587.92
where you can't escape from it like

2586.4 --> 2592.319
stalkers and [ __ ] right

2587.92 --> 2595.44
nathan doesn't do that yeah

2592.319 --> 2598.8
nathan only treats people

2595.44 --> 2602.48
harshly on

2598.8 --> 2606.1600000000003
his show those people

2602.48 --> 2609.52
show up voluntarily on

2606.16 --> 2611.04
his show and they can leave with a

2609.52 --> 2613.68
clicker button

2611.04 --> 2615.839
instantly nothing to stop them that's

2613.68 --> 2619.52
not bullying

2615.839 --> 2620.0789999999997
yeah yeah yeah you did say that wrong

2619.52 --> 2622.8
that's right

2620.079 --> 2622.8
tiny wombo

2623.92 --> 2627.839
i'm glad you recognize it

2629.359 --> 2631.92
what's this

2633.839 --> 2639.7599999999998
yeah what that oh no

2637.359 --> 2641.92
actually didn't need to necessarily hide

2639.76 --> 2644.0
that

2641.92 --> 2645.359
well actually i understand it's just a

2644.0 --> 2647.599
troll but

2645.359 --> 2648.96
why would anyone stalk a flat earther

2647.599 --> 2651.44
they're irrelevant

2648.96 --> 2652.56
well why don't you ask the people that

2651.44 --> 2655.119
stalk me

2652.56 --> 2657.2
why don't you ask grim v that literally

2655.119 --> 2658.319
thinks it's funny to call me up on my

2657.2 --> 2660.72
phone

2658.319 --> 2662.8
now on a daily basis and he's done that

2660.72 --> 2664.16
before and i know it's him i recognize

2662.8 --> 2665.6800000000003
his voice

2664.16 --> 2668.319
and he did that years ago he didn't that

2665.68 --> 2670.8799999999997
to other people yeah why does he do that

2668.319 --> 2671.7599999999998
why why don't you ask him why does he do

2670.88 --> 2674.96
that

2671.76 --> 2677.6800000000003
right he's not doing it because we're

2674.96 --> 2680.079
irrelevant

2677.68 --> 2681.68
right so why don't you ask that i don't

2680.079 --> 2683.2000000000003
know why they're stalking me i'm they're

2681.68 --> 2683.9199999999996
probably stalking me because i'm getting

2683.2 --> 2687.2
to them

2683.92 --> 2687.2000000000003
and they can't leave it alone

2687.28 --> 2692.6400000000003
that's usually has something to do when

2690.079 --> 2696.319
you can't leave something alone

2692.64 --> 2699.52
that's usually because it's true

2696.319 --> 2703.44
and you can't handle it so you gotta go

2699.52 --> 2706.56
back to where that truth is spoken about

2703.44 --> 2708.88
publicly and then stop it because you

2706.56 --> 2712.16
don't want to be confronted

2708.88 --> 2716.7200000000003
with the facts that disrupt

2712.16 --> 2719.92
your false belief and then you end up

2716.72 --> 2722.3999999999996
getting back trying to stop something

2719.92 --> 2724.079
right if it was all nonsense if it was

2722.4 --> 2725.6800000000003
just nonsense that i was talking about

2724.079 --> 2727.6800000000003
it's just wrong right it's just wrong oh

2725.68 --> 2730.16
you look it up it's just wrong okay

2727.68 --> 2731.52
well why would you come back then every

2730.16 --> 2734.7999999999997
day

2731.52 --> 2738.0
and nag me huh

2734.8 --> 2741.28
where where does that happen in reality

2738.0 --> 2744.4
with other subjects you know why

2741.28 --> 2747.28
do people stalk others

2744.4 --> 2749.28
bother them threaten them and keep on

2747.28 --> 2751.76
coming back

2749.28 --> 2753.8390000000004
it's not because those people are just

2751.76 --> 2758.1600000000003
talking random nonsense or just

2753.839 --> 2760.0
silly fantasy or whatever no

2758.16 --> 2761.5989999999997
they do it because they're actually

2760.0 --> 2765.119
getting

2761.599 --> 2766.88
to those people coming after them

2765.119 --> 2769.44
and when you get to someone that's

2766.88 --> 2773.52
usually a sign that you're

2769.44 --> 2776.8
getting to a truthful matter in some way

2773.52 --> 2779.52
and those people can't handle it

2776.8 --> 2780.8
it's the primary reason why people do

2779.52 --> 2783.92
that to others

2780.8 --> 2786.0
because those others confront them

2783.92 --> 2787.6800000000003
with something about themselves and

2786.0 --> 2789.839
reality that they don't want to be

2787.68 --> 2792.8799999999997
confronted with ever

2789.839 --> 2793.7599999999998
so then they try to erase it to forget

2792.88 --> 2796.96
about it

2793.76 --> 2798.6400000000003
right if it was just nonsense you would

2796.96 --> 2800.2400000000002
never get to that

2798.64 --> 2803.839
action you would never have the

2800.24 --> 2803.839
necessity to do that

2804.079 --> 2810.079
because it's just random [ __ ] right

2807.28 --> 2811.8390000000004
so i remember there's like a being a lot

2810.079 --> 2814.079
of

2811.839 --> 2816.16
ascension hippies i've just got a little

2814.079 --> 2819.2000000000003
bit of a derogatory terminology

2816.16 --> 2821.92
but ascension hippies in the 90s

2819.2 --> 2824.0789999999997
for example and they were literally just

2821.92 --> 2825.44
spouting nonsense but oh we're aliens

2824.079 --> 2826.48
and we're going to communicate through

2825.44 --> 2830.48
the stargate

2826.48 --> 2833.119
and it's like oh my god i have to

2830.48 --> 2835.92
keep track of what he's saying i have to

2833.119 --> 2838.8
ensure that he doesn't spread the lies

2835.92 --> 2839.839
no no you don't because it's nonsense

2838.8 --> 2842.559
you just let them

2839.839 --> 2843.2799999999997
do their thing nobody cares because it's

2842.559 --> 2845.599
nonsense

2843.28 --> 2846.559
right so why isn't that happening to

2845.599 --> 2851.04
flat earth

2846.559 --> 2859.8390000000004
huh am i shining through yet

2851.04 --> 2859.839
why do you keep coming back to do that

2864.88 --> 2873.839
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

2868.319 --> 2873.839
clutch bear

2876.24 --> 2879.9199999999996
oh dear oh dear idea

2883.119 --> 2887.76
our model can predict the motion of

2885.599 --> 2891.52
planets and moons and

2887.76 --> 2892.3190000000004
that's really lovely i'm sure it'll work

2891.52 --> 2894.559
out great

2892.319 --> 2898.5589999999997
when you try to make an animation of it

2894.559 --> 2898.559
it'll look beautiful very convincing

2899.359 --> 2915.839
it's not real though

2940.839 --> 2945.359
wow

2942.0 --> 2947.28
hello look xyz

2945.359 --> 2948.96
you need to stop blabbering about theo

2947.28 --> 2953.0400000000004
light nonsense

2948.96 --> 2954.4
all right brian remember ryan from the

2953.04 --> 2957.68
panel

2954.4 --> 2961.04
brian's logic yeah he's literally

2957.68 --> 2964.24
been employed as somebody

2961.04 --> 2964.96
using the odd lights and all it's ever

2964.24 --> 2970.0
used for

2964.96 --> 2974.0
is just to measure the level the level

2970.0 --> 2977.68
and then all put it together all those

2974.0 --> 2980.16
those measured flat parts

2977.68 --> 2980.96
and then eventually all the data is put

2980.16 --> 2984.0
together

2980.96 --> 2986.079
and then shaped into a presupposed

2984.0 --> 2987.599
ball that's exactly what happens because

2986.079 --> 2991.04
the actual data is

2987.599 --> 2994.96
all as flat as can be it's all very

2991.04 --> 2998.0
euclidean very flat the data is flat

2994.96 --> 3001.359
and then it's being put together

2998.0 --> 3003.599
in a spherical geometry

3001.359 --> 3004.48
with the presupposed radius that's how

3003.599 --> 3006.96
it works

3004.48 --> 3009.599
not any other way there is no curve that

3006.96 --> 3009.599
it measures

3010.839 --> 3013.839
ever

3017.2 --> 3022.72
all right yeah tara 306 you should have

3020.48 --> 3027.44
some new subs

3022.72 --> 3030.48
nice i got some new subs as well nathan

3027.44 --> 3032.4
thanks to your efforts yesterday i think

3030.48 --> 3041.839
i got like 20

3032.4 --> 3041.839
20 new ones

3052.88 --> 3056.0
right yeah sleeping warrior 2 of course

3054.96 --> 3060.64
he lost his

3056.0 --> 3063.68
original channel he's got a new one

3060.64 --> 3066.96
so do subscribe to that new channel he's

3063.68 --> 3069.7599999999998
only got 35 right now i'll put your link

3066.96 --> 3083.839
to your channel in the chat go and

3069.76 --> 3083.8390000000004
subscribe to a sleeping warrior

3092.48 --> 3096.0
okay oh and the gabber everything you

3094.8 --> 3100.559
just said is wrong

3096.0 --> 3100.559
and it was spelled wrong so

3106.24 --> 3110.16
science behind the fe model that's a

3108.96 --> 3111.599
model

3110.16 --> 3114.64
doesn't have anything to do with the

3111.599 --> 3114.6400000000003
scientific method

3119.359 --> 3125.839
cool thanks guys

3135.04 --> 3139.2799999999997
right father-son child well i've

3136.96 --> 3141.92
described the effect the practical

3139.28 --> 3145.52
effect of how you experience the horizon

3141.92 --> 3148.319
is that your side kind of

3145.52 --> 3149.7599999999998
comes together like this the bottom of

3148.319 --> 3151.7599999999998
where you're looking at the top of what

3149.76 --> 3156.7200000000003
you're looking comes together like this

3151.76 --> 3156.7200000000003
and then it kind of folds into it

3162.48 --> 3168.559
and i've made a diagram for that i don't

3166.319 --> 3170.88
know how to currently present it

3168.559 --> 3170.88
though

3174.0 --> 3177.2
but yeah eyeball on the stick i think

3176.24 --> 3179.52
everybody's know

3177.2 --> 3181.839
i've seen that picture by now eyeball on

3179.52 --> 3181.839
the stick

3199.599 --> 3205.92
well go ask him yourself xyz brian is

3203.119 --> 3206.88
uh very often present during the live

3205.92 --> 3208.7200000000003
show

3206.88 --> 3210.8
over at the flat earth debate which

3208.72 --> 3213.04
should start up in about an hour from

3210.8 --> 3213.04
now

3214.16 --> 3221.52
oh wait right yeah yeah yeah

3218.88 --> 3222.8
so you could go into chat there and ask

3221.52 --> 3227.7599999999998
him yourself

3222.8 --> 3227.76
i'm sure he's going to answer some time

3230.319 --> 3233.839
i i've never even personally seen at the

3233.2 --> 3236.64
odd light

3233.839 --> 3237.119
like in the real world so i don't know

3236.64 --> 3239.52
what

3237.119 --> 3251.839
too much about it he however does he's

3239.52 --> 3251.839
worked with them professionally

3262.839 --> 3265.839
do

3276.839 --> 3279.839
oh

3292.72 --> 3297.359
all right xyz if you really think you

3295.28 --> 3301.0400000000004
got something why don't you contact

3297.359 --> 3303.7599999999998
brian ryan's logic

3301.04 --> 3305.2799999999997
directly and why don't you go for a

3303.76 --> 3308.559
one-on-one with him

3305.28 --> 3312.079
right you think you know better than him

3308.559 --> 3312.079
do a 101 show with him

3313.52 --> 3317.92
i'm pretty sure he will be up for that

3315.52 --> 3320.16
you know brian doesn't shy away from a

3317.92 --> 3323.44
challenge like that

3320.16 --> 3325.2799999999997
so yeah just tell him hey i want to do a

3323.44 --> 3329.04
one-on-one

3325.28 --> 3335.8390000000004
about theodolites let's do it

3329.04 --> 3335.839
i'm not gonna do it but i'm sure he will

3387.119 --> 3391.839
yeah oh man

3417.359 --> 3421.04
right thanks for all the supporting date

3419.68 --> 3425.5989999999997
data guys

3421.04 --> 3427.44
data oh it doesn't understand well why

3425.599 --> 3428.6400000000003
don't you actually figure that out

3427.44 --> 3432.16
instead of

3428.64 --> 3436.96
just making ad-hom claims about him

3432.16 --> 3438.5589999999997
before you've actually spoken to him xyz

3436.96 --> 3440.079
don't really appreciate that why don't

3438.559 --> 3441.6800000000003
you just take the challenge you think

3440.079 --> 3442.88
you know so much about sea odd lights

3441.68 --> 3443.5989999999997
and how they're supposedly gonna prove

3442.88 --> 3445.599
the globe

3443.599 --> 3446.96
why don't you challenge somebody that's

3445.599 --> 3450.48
actually admittedly

3446.96 --> 3454.16
worked with them that's very

3450.48 --> 3458.079
mathematical mathematically built

3454.16 --> 3461.1189999999997
like he has a very mathematical mind so

3458.079 --> 3462.559
an idiot oh well you're a band just

3461.119 --> 3475.839
gonna ban you

3462.559 --> 3475.8390000000004
yeah no you don't do that here

3488.96 --> 3492.16
i wonder if the fe be able to produce

3491.599 --> 3495.44
something

3492.16 --> 3497.839
legit with confronts do you say

3495.44 --> 3499.2000000000003
well we are we don't need to build

3497.839 --> 3501.2799999999997
anything for that

3499.2 --> 3502.3999999999996
you just need to point out how the

3501.28 --> 3505.599
sphere model

3502.4 --> 3511.119
is completely impossible and just

3505.599 --> 3511.119
not based on actual measured evidence

3512.48 --> 3521.119
yeah we don't need to give you

3516.319 --> 3524.16
an alternative it's not our problem

3521.119 --> 3525.119
that you've become neurotically addicted

3524.16 --> 3527.52
to the false

3525.119 --> 3529.599
assumption that everything's already

3527.52 --> 3533.839
been figured out we know it all

3529.599 --> 3537.2000000000003
yeah you don't it was a lie get over it

3533.839 --> 3540.799
we're not gonna give you an alternative

3537.2 --> 3543.68
yeah we're not gonna replace the lie

3540.799 --> 3545.52
you were fed your life with another lie

3543.68 --> 3547.04
we're just going to point out how it's a

3545.52 --> 3549.44
lie

3547.04 --> 3550.64
and then you can figure it out or you

3549.44 --> 3555.599
can

3550.64 --> 3558.799
look around see who is figuring out what

3555.599 --> 3561.6800000000003
yeah we don't have a responsibility

3558.799 --> 3563.7599999999998
to fill in all the blanks of the things

3561.68 --> 3573.839
you don't know

3563.76 --> 3573.8390000000004
you figure it out

3578.319 --> 3581.359
well if you wouldn't be able to figure

3579.68 --> 3584.48
out anything like that then what are you

3581.359 --> 3586.64
doing here in the first place

3584.48 --> 3587.68
why why are you trying to criticize

3586.64 --> 3589.7599999999998
things we do

3587.68 --> 3592.0
when you you're not even able to figure

3589.76 --> 3594.079
it out what are you doing here

3592.0 --> 3595.44
you think you're supporting people when

3594.079 --> 3596.88
you're engaging in something you

3595.44 --> 3600.2400000000002
literally just admitted you

3596.88 --> 3603.52
you're not competent enough to do that

3600.24 --> 3605.2799999999997
who are you to correct us when you

3603.52 --> 3607.599
you've already admitted you you don't

3605.28 --> 3615.28
even have

3607.599 --> 3618.0
the capability of figuring it out

3615.28 --> 3620.96
all right jose bobington see you later

3618.0 --> 3620.96
thanks for popping by

3625.359 --> 3632.96
oh next question xyz how is it possible

3630.319 --> 3633.92
it's very simple it's luminaries it's

3632.96 --> 3637.2
lights in the sky

3633.92 --> 3638.7200000000003
at an angular position right they're not

3637.2 --> 3641.5989999999997
actually in any physical literal

3638.72 --> 3644.8799999999997
position just angular ones

3641.599 --> 3647.2000000000003
and then there's the no curve factor

3644.88 --> 3648.559
so whatever you're going to imagine the

3647.2 --> 3650.3999999999996
celestial lights to be

3648.559 --> 3653.3590000000004
it's not going to work out it's only

3650.4 --> 3656.1600000000003
going to work out in your fantasy

3653.359 --> 3657.119
that's the only place it works out in

3656.16 --> 3660.799
right

3657.119 --> 3664.0
so who cares

3660.799 --> 3667.2
where the celestial body angles

3664.0 --> 3669.599
are at on what position of the earth

3667.2 --> 3671.5989999999997
it doesn't prove anything you have no

3669.599 --> 3674.079
proof the celestial lights are

3671.599 --> 3676.96
physical or in any euclidean literal

3674.079 --> 3679.3590000000004
position in the first place

3676.96 --> 3680.4
right you just have the angular sights

3679.359 --> 3682.88
that's it

3680.4 --> 3685.04
doesn't prove anything it only proves

3682.88 --> 3686.88
something if you're going to

3685.04 --> 3688.64
build it a whole build it up with a

3686.88 --> 3691.6800000000003
whole bunch of presuppositions

3688.64 --> 3692.24
that you won't prove yeah that's not how

3691.68 --> 3696.24
proof

3692.24 --> 3698.8799999999997
works to prove something you got to

3696.24 --> 3701.7599999999998
actually prove something and not just

3698.88 --> 3702.799
do a little math trick and then deduce a

3701.76 --> 3713.8390000000004
conclusion

3702.799 --> 3713.839
that's not how science works

3724.839 --> 3727.839
uh

3734.88 --> 3741.839
huh well agm i i don't know man

3743.52 --> 3747.7599999999998
if i'd ever see something like that i

3745.599 --> 3750.1600000000003
would probably think that i'm dreaming

3747.76 --> 3751.8390000000004
or dead

3750.16 --> 3755.839
i don't think i'm ever going to witness

3751.839 --> 3755.839
that within my physical lifetime

3763.2 --> 3769.839
i first saw the concept in the movie

3766.079 --> 3769.8390000000004
eric the viking

3784.079 --> 3788.96
which is by the way a really interesting

3786.559 --> 3791.28
movie in many many ways if you're

3788.96 --> 3794.319
cosmogeny interested

3791.28 --> 3799.119
eric the viking is a must watch a

3794.319 --> 3799.119
must watch trust me on this

3808.839 --> 3811.839
seriously

3820.72 --> 3826.0789999999997
wait what pseudo-ramonian positions

3826.72 --> 3830.0989999999997
uh

3827.03 --> 3830.099
[Music]

3832.16 --> 3837.52
what i don't think there's such a thing

3834.799 --> 3853.839
in the real world though

3837.52 --> 3853.839
for space is a purely conceptual medium

3857.76 --> 3864.96
no sir no we don't

3861.52 --> 3870.48
no we don't need to give you math

3864.96 --> 3870.48
to support some viable proof

3870.559 --> 3873.8390000000004
we don't need to do that at all math is

3873.28 --> 3877.119
just

3873.839 --> 3878.96
an assistant tool it's an extract it's

3877.119 --> 3882.96
not the foundation of proof

3878.96 --> 3887.839
math literally doesn't prove anything

3882.96 --> 3891.2
but it can make proof that exists

3887.839 --> 3892.16
easier to understand and oversee how it

3891.2 --> 3895.359
works

3892.16 --> 3898.799
it can assist understanding

3895.359 --> 3904.16
it doesn't prove anything yeah so

3898.799 --> 3904.16
we don't have to show you any math

3904.64 --> 3908.48
we just have to show you the natural

3906.96 --> 3911.839
consequences

3908.48 --> 3923.839
of the assumptions that you believe in

3911.839 --> 3923.839
through the heliocentric model

3927.839 --> 3935.599
ah all right well there you go

3932.319 --> 3936.96
see sharik patel good one life is short

3935.599 --> 3939.28
has indeed

3936.96 --> 3942.64
worked out the maths for optics which is

3939.28 --> 3946.48
a mind-blowing feat in my opinion i

3942.64 --> 3948.16
like his work is really astounding

3946.48 --> 3950.72
it gives me a bit of a headache though

3948.16 --> 3951.2
sometimes but he's worked out a great

3950.72 --> 3953.9199999999996
deal

3951.2 --> 3955.359
even to the mathematical level because

3953.92 --> 3958.4
he can

3955.359 --> 3961.119
you know and he chose to i choose

3958.4 --> 3963.96
i don't give a [ __ ] really i'm more

3961.119 --> 3966.96
interested in being able to

3963.96 --> 3970.319
describe things

3966.96 --> 3970.64
in a way that everybody can understand

3970.319 --> 3973.44
it

3970.64 --> 3974.64
because understanding is more important

3973.44 --> 3976.16
than math

3974.64 --> 3978.0
yeah and there's a whole bunch of people

3976.16 --> 3981.359
out there that don't

3978.0 --> 3983.2
understand math very well yeah

3981.359 --> 3984.799
they're going to see some formula with

3983.2 --> 3986.16
all these numbers and letters and

3984.799 --> 3987.839
they're going to be like ah i get a

3986.16 --> 3991.68
headache i don't get this

3987.839 --> 3992.799
that's why i prefer to verbally explain

3991.68 --> 3995.2
things

3992.799 --> 3996.0
because a lot more people than get it

3995.2 --> 3999.2
yeah

3996.0 --> 4002.16
that actually spreads understanding math

3999.2 --> 4003.7599999999998
just reduces the people that are going

4002.16 --> 4006.96
to understand it

4003.76 --> 4008.88
to a very few that are really good at it

4006.96 --> 4010.079
and i know where those people are at

4008.88 --> 4012.6400000000003
yeah

4010.079 --> 4014.48
that's the globers they love it they

4012.64 --> 4018.24
drown in math and they use it

4014.48 --> 4019.92
constantly to basically show off

4018.24 --> 4021.4399999999996
like oh look at my math i get it so much

4019.92 --> 4022.96
i understand you don't understand the

4021.44 --> 4024.4
math and then the people will be like oh

4022.96 --> 4025.119
yeah i don't really understand it i'm

4024.4 --> 4027.2000000000003
just gonna

4025.119 --> 4029.6800000000003
you just do your math sure you're very

4027.2 --> 4032.799
cool we don't understand yeah

4029.68 --> 4033.2799999999997
that's where i come in and i discard the

4032.799 --> 4037.0389999999998
math

4033.28 --> 4038.559
and just start explaining what is

4037.039 --> 4040.88
and then all those people that have been

4038.559 --> 4042.4
like oh those math people man they're so

4040.88 --> 4044.2400000000002
smart i don't get it

4042.4 --> 4045.839
they suddenly start to understand what

4044.24 --> 4049.359
the hell is going on

4045.839 --> 4051.44
yeah that's what's happening

4049.359 --> 4053.359
i know you don't like it but it's what's

4051.44 --> 4058.559
happening and it's what's gonna

4053.359 --> 4058.5589999999997
continue to happen for the foreseeable

4060.839 --> 4063.839
future

4069.2 --> 4073.2
now come on tiny wumble don't get

4071.2 --> 4077.839
derogatory to yourself

4073.2 --> 4077.839
i didn't call anybody baltard so far

4078.0 --> 4081.2
nobody behaved in a way that they that

4080.559 --> 4091.8390000000004
such a

4081.2 --> 4091.839
terminology is warranted at this time so

4109.52 --> 4112.56
what would be the point of you all

4111.6 --> 4114.319
sitting around

4112.56 --> 4116.319
nodding and agreeing with each other

4114.319 --> 4118.319
well that's not really all that happens

4116.319 --> 4120.719
you know that might be the initiator

4118.319 --> 4123.359
but what will eventually happen is that

4120.719 --> 4126.64
the argumentation and the insights

4123.359 --> 4129.52
can be echoed and then other people

4126.64 --> 4130.2390000000005
will start to find the courage and the

4129.52 --> 4133.1990000000005
skill

4130.239 --> 4135.04
to attempt to explain it better and in

4133.199 --> 4136.159
such make a better argument in

4135.04 --> 4138.64
situations

4136.159 --> 4140.3189999999995
yeah that's not just all sitting around

4138.64 --> 4143.679
and nodding our heads

4140.319 --> 4161.839000000001
huh no it's called learning

4143.679 --> 4161.839
attaining skills and insight

4184.96 --> 4190.4
come on sure i don't

4188.4 --> 4203.839999999999
don't get all at home again there's no

4190.4 --> 4203.839999999999
need for that

4210.4 --> 4214.96
yes of course tiny woman i do answer

4213.679 --> 4218.8
questions it's

4214.96 --> 4230.32
one of the things i do here on the show

4218.8 --> 4234.159000000001
but i'm glad you took note of it

4230.32 --> 4237.5199999999995
all right as for this guy sahas

4234.159 --> 4239.36
who claims he has no pain i don't know

4237.52 --> 4242.320000000001
where he's at

4239.36 --> 4244.32
i don't think he's a full-on glober yet

4242.32 --> 4248.32
i think he might be kind of like

4244.32 --> 4250.239
more of a newbie i happen to have been

4248.32 --> 4254.0
very good

4250.239 --> 4254.799999999999
in math and all that but i'm not getting

4254.0 --> 4257.84
like the

4254.8 --> 4259.52
the totally doubling down and lying vibe

4257.84 --> 4273.84
of him just yet

4259.52 --> 4273.84
so don't get too rough within

4281.679 --> 4290.4
something being obvious isn't proof

4284.96 --> 4293.92
uh regurgitation statement

4290.4 --> 4296.5599999999995
really well maybe you're taking it

4293.92 --> 4299.6
slightly out of context there hogart

4296.56 --> 4302.400000000001
i know you like to do that i'm

4299.6 --> 4304.08
pretty sure that what he actually said

4302.4 --> 4308.96
is something being obvious

4304.08 --> 4308.96
isn't scientific proof

4312.159 --> 4315.679
so i think you're being a little bit

4314.239 --> 4318.239
quote miney

4315.679 --> 4318.2390000000005
right now

4320.88 --> 4325.04
no that's not what he said obvious

4322.8 --> 4330.56
doesn't mean scientific

4325.04 --> 4330.56
proof do i need to repeat it again

4336.8 --> 4342.320000000001
because at the same time nathan also

4339.36 --> 4345.759999999999
definitely lays down the personal claim

4342.32 --> 4350.32
that the earth is visibly

4345.76 --> 4353.679
observably obviously flat right

4350.32 --> 4354.719
that is proof it's just not scientific

4353.679 --> 4356.719
proof

4354.719 --> 4358.0
so yeah it's kind of obvious to me

4356.719 --> 4361.04
you're taking

4358.0 --> 4364.239
the whole thing out of whack

4361.04 --> 4364.719
by accident i'm sure by accident of

4364.239 --> 4369.12
course

4364.719 --> 4369.12
you didn't tend to do that at all right

4385.84 --> 4391.04
are measurements proof well not

4388.159 --> 4391.04
scientific proof

4393.679 --> 4397.12
measurements are measurements and they

4395.6 --> 4399.679
provide data

4397.12 --> 4402.64
then depends on the conclusions drawn on

4399.679 --> 4402.64
the data whether

4402.719 --> 4406.56
yeah what it means what you could what

4405.04 --> 4413.84
you could draw

4406.56 --> 4413.84
what conclusions can you draw from it

4419.679 --> 4427.84
are you getting wisdom describes an

4423.44 --> 4427.839999999999
opinion what

4438.0 --> 4445.28
measurably flat right

4441.44 --> 4447.04
or measurably flat or just flat enough

4445.28 --> 4449.44
that's what i like to call it the earth

4447.04 --> 4452.719
is flat enough i can't prove that it is

4449.44 --> 4455.759999999999
like perfectly to the millimeter

4452.719 --> 4458.56
flat can't prove that right the

4455.76 --> 4460.719
orientation the geometrical orientation

4458.56 --> 4462.96
of the earth's surface because the earth

4460.719 --> 4464.159
is not literally flat there's mountains

4462.96 --> 4466.8
sticking out

4464.159 --> 4468.0
of course right but the geometrical

4466.8 --> 4471.84
orientation it's

4468.0 --> 4474.8
as good as flat or flat enough

4471.84 --> 4475.360000000001
now what that means for the overall

4474.8 --> 4478.4800000000005
realm

4475.36 --> 4481.36
setup well that's certain

4478.48 --> 4482.48
natural limitation based consequences

4481.36 --> 4485.839999999999
and that i've

4482.48 --> 4488.639999999999
explored very extensively on my shows

4485.84 --> 4489.84
even back way back when i first started

4488.64 --> 4492.88
up this channel

4489.84 --> 4494.96
so kinds of potential possibilities as

4492.88 --> 4497.92
what the realm layout can be

4494.96 --> 4501.52
like why and how and all the natural

4497.92 --> 4501.52
consequences that will come with it

4502.4 --> 4505.92
it doesn't mean that you could just pick

4504.32 --> 4508.96
one of those options and say

4505.92 --> 4512.4
this is it this is it because

4508.96 --> 4514.88
i think it is that i don't know

4512.4 --> 4515.599999999999
but i think it is that because i like it

4514.88 --> 4517.36
the most

4515.6 --> 4519.76
right or something like that no that's

4517.36 --> 4524.639999999999
not how it works you actually gotta

4519.76 --> 4527.52
test it step by step to figure out

4524.64 --> 4528.0
how you're gonna go through the the big

4527.52 --> 4530.0
route

4528.0 --> 4532.239
of possibilities because the further

4530.0 --> 4534.0
away from what you know with absolute

4532.239 --> 4537.28
certainty you go

4534.0 --> 4539.84
the more fractal the more extensive the

4537.28 --> 4539.84
options become

4539.92 --> 4543.6
so you got to just get really close to

4542.88 --> 4547.28
home

4543.6 --> 4548.56
and start figuring it out so for example

4547.28 --> 4551.36
a big part of

4548.56 --> 4552.64
figuring out the the nature of the realm

4551.36 --> 4556.5599999999995
would be

4552.64 --> 4560.96
to figure out the true geometrical

4556.56 --> 4564.719
orientation of the apparent equator line

4560.96 --> 4568.4800000000005
so to truly figure out the land mass

4564.719 --> 4571.12
orientations in the known realm with

4568.48 --> 4572.959999999999
the celestial orientations in the realm

4571.12 --> 4574.719
right because now we're basically

4572.96 --> 4576.96
assuming that the celestials are

4574.719 --> 4580.88
perfectly consistent

4576.96 --> 4585.28
and we rearrange maps

4580.88 --> 4586.0
in order based oh yeah we rearrange the

4585.28 --> 4589.679
maps

4586.0 --> 4591.76
to that assumption but in reality it

4589.679 --> 4595.04
might actually turn out to be

4591.76 --> 4595.52
that the celestial lights are not all

4595.04 --> 4597.679
that

4595.52 --> 4600.080000000001
perfect not all that perfectly

4597.679 --> 4603.1990000000005
consistent and that at some points

4600.08 --> 4604.4
it might be turned for some reason

4603.199 --> 4607.44
mysterious reason that

4604.4 --> 4608.0
really so hard to even start trying to

4607.44 --> 4611.28
figure out

4608.0 --> 4612.64
why but it could be established that hey

4611.28 --> 4615.199
wait why

4612.64 --> 4616.08
the physical land mass is literally

4615.199 --> 4618.5599999999995
measured to be

4616.08 --> 4619.679
right there but when you go there

4618.56 --> 4622.64
suddenly

4619.679 --> 4623.92
i don't know that the sun pathway is

4622.64 --> 4628.2390000000005
slightly different

4623.92 --> 4630.4
for no logical reason

4628.239 --> 4633.199
that you could figure out right that

4630.4 --> 4635.199
sort of thing could be the case

4633.199 --> 4637.199
right we don't know so there's so much

4635.199 --> 4640.239
to figure out about the very

4637.199 --> 4641.5199999999995
realm that we know and stand in before

4640.239 --> 4644.799999999999
you can even

4641.52 --> 4648.2390000000005
start to figure out what's supposedly

4644.8 --> 4648.8
outside of these known confines what is

4648.239 --> 4652.0
beyond

4648.8 --> 4652.64
how is that laid out we first have to

4652.0 --> 4655.36
understand

4652.64 --> 4656.8
how this realm is laid out and what

4655.36 --> 4660.32
elements are present

4656.8 --> 4663.52
is everything exactly euclidean

4660.32 --> 4664.08
is the earth like for example a literal

4663.52 --> 4667.679
disc

4664.08 --> 4670.5599999999995
exactly as is like a perfect miniature

4667.679 --> 4671.28
is that the realm or is it not like that

4670.56 --> 4675.1990000000005
at all

4671.28 --> 4677.599999999999
like not at all it might be completely

4675.199 --> 4679.04
spatially warped it's something i've

4677.6 --> 4682.320000000001
been trying to

4679.04 --> 4684.0
introduce as a concept to how people

4682.32 --> 4685.92
wrap their minds around it because it is

4684.0 --> 4689.6
freaking complicated

4685.92 --> 4693.76
non spatial non-linearity right

4689.6 --> 4697.6
looping a looping nature to the realm

4693.76 --> 4701.679
and yeah that's

4697.6 --> 4705.76
where i try to focus most of the time

4701.679 --> 4706.32
to keep people from just starting to

4705.76 --> 4710.320000000001
assume

4706.32 --> 4713.04
certain complete pictures of the realm

4710.32 --> 4713.599999999999
because they like it and not because

4713.04 --> 4721.84
they have

4713.6 --> 4721.84
absolutely definitive evidence for it

4726.8 --> 4730.88
how high is the sun according to your

4729.44 --> 4732.879999999999
wrong earth model oh

4730.88 --> 4734.400000000001
you're are you being as smart as you

4732.88 --> 4737.4400000000005
want to get banned sometime

4734.4 --> 4739.12
not doing it yet but you're going to say

4737.44 --> 4740.879999999999
things like that you're kind of

4739.12 --> 4744.719
soliciting for it

4740.88 --> 4746.32
right so what's the distance to the sun

4744.719 --> 4748.4
sahas

4746.32 --> 4749.599999999999
distance to the sun you say what is the

4748.4 --> 4751.759999999999
sun

4749.6 --> 4753.76
wait are you claiming there is a

4751.76 --> 4757.6
distance to the sun

4753.76 --> 4757.6
what's your empirical proof for that

4758.56 --> 4765.4400000000005
you're saying the sun is close

4762.0 --> 4769.76
really so when you go there where you

4765.44 --> 4772.799999999999
presume it literally is it's there is it

4769.76 --> 4776.4800000000005
no the sun is not a physical object

4772.8 --> 4779.52
it's a light-based apparition a

4776.48 --> 4784.159
side effect if you will of

4779.52 --> 4786.080000000001
light manifest in an angular fashion

4784.159 --> 4788.239
that's the best conclusion that i can

4786.08 --> 4788.96
draw from the data that i've gathered so

4788.239 --> 4792.159
far

4788.96 --> 4795.28
there's no proof that any of these

4792.159 --> 4799.12
angles of the celestial lights actually

4795.28 --> 4801.84
add up to a specific light position

4799.12 --> 4802.88
in euclidean space from which the light

4801.84 --> 4806.0
originates

4802.88 --> 4809.04
there is no proof for this at all not

4806.0 --> 4812.96
even close not the moon not the sun

4809.04 --> 4816.239
not the planets not the stars nothing

4812.96 --> 4819.04
none of it is originating from a literal

4816.239 --> 4820.4
physical position in space there is no

4819.04 --> 4824.08
evidence for this

4820.4 --> 4827.36
none whatsoever no evidence

4824.08 --> 4831.5199999999995
no evidence no evidence zero

4827.36 --> 4834.639
zero zero evidence yeah

4831.52 --> 4834.96
but of course you can imagine based on

4834.639 --> 4838.32
the

4834.96 --> 4840.88
science fiction story that well it must

4838.32 --> 4841.199
be there because people went to the moon

4840.88 --> 4844.32
and

4841.199 --> 4846.719
landed on it we're going through

4844.32 --> 4847.84
outer space vacuum right right yeah yeah

4846.719 --> 4852.08
no

4847.84 --> 4854.400000000001
that's nonsense when it comes to actual

4852.08 --> 4856.639
testing in the physical world out there

4854.4 --> 4858.4
by people on an empiric level where they

4856.639 --> 4861.679
can do it themselves and not

4858.4 --> 4864.48
under some coordinated project that

4861.679 --> 4867.28
keeps the data to themselves right

4864.48 --> 4868.48
yeah people out there when they try to

4867.28 --> 4872.08
test things

4868.48 --> 4876.08
there's just no proof that even the moon

4872.08 --> 4879.28
with all its suggestive looks

4876.08 --> 4881.36
is physical in any sort of way right

4879.28 --> 4883.12
oh and then i'm expecting people to

4881.36 --> 4885.36
basically insert now but what about the

4883.12 --> 4886.159
moon signal rebounds moon signal

4885.36 --> 4888.32
rebounds

4886.159 --> 4890.08
it proves it's physical no there is no

4888.32 --> 4891.92
moon signal rebounds there's no evidence

4890.08 --> 4895.639
of this is a giant hoax

4891.92 --> 4899.1990000000005
story based on radio

4895.639 --> 4902.08
fraudsters that say

4899.199 --> 4902.638999999999
that happens and it doesn't happen it's

4902.08 --> 4905.76
a

4902.639 --> 4909.1990000000005
lie blatant lie those people

4905.76 --> 4912.8
should be at least fined perhaps

4909.199 --> 4914.719
jailed for just blatant fraud

4912.8 --> 4916.0
oh wait yeah it doesn't really work in

4914.719 --> 4918.32
this world right you can just

4916.0 --> 4919.199
claim whatever and get away with it as

4918.32 --> 4922.639
long as you are

4919.199 --> 4924.96
on the side of the authority

4922.639 --> 4926.4800000000005
yeah and the authority claims a

4924.96 --> 4928.88
heliocentric model

4926.48 --> 4930.0
so doesn't really matter but i've

4928.88 --> 4933.92
already suggested

4930.0 --> 4937.52
exactly how you could potentially test

4933.92 --> 4940.639
whether there is a moon signal rebounds

4937.52 --> 4941.120000000001
with a setup and plenty of cameras i've

4940.639 --> 4942.96
done

4941.12 --> 4945.36
a couple of episodes on the flat earth

4942.96 --> 4946.88
early bird show specifically about this

4945.36 --> 4949.759999999999
the entire show

4946.88 --> 4950.639
you can look it back in the titles it

4949.76 --> 4954.639
has the title

4950.639 --> 4957.84
within the show to know exactly

4954.639 --> 4961.04
how you can prove or disprove

4957.84 --> 4963.84
that a ham radio signal

4961.04 --> 4964.96
can bounce off the moon and be

4963.84 --> 4968.8
registered

4964.96 --> 4970.719
yeah you can literally test that

4968.8 --> 4973.28
on an empirical way that you can

4970.719 --> 4974.0
literally vary and manipulate the signal

4973.28 --> 4977.759999999999
rebounds

4974.0 --> 4981.52
on the spot provably no suggestions

4977.76 --> 4984.400000000001
no nonsense on camera empirical

4981.52 --> 4985.040000000001
in the spot manip varied and manipulated

4984.4 --> 4989.04
evidence

4985.04 --> 4990.88
you could do that you can do that

4989.04 --> 4992.48
guess what there's no videos of that out

4990.88 --> 4995.28
there right now even though i made

4992.48 --> 4998.32
that specific that specific setup i

4995.28 --> 4999.599999999999
shared for the entire bowler and radio

4998.32 --> 5002.32
world

4999.6 --> 5002.96
over a year ago it's almost two years

5002.32 --> 5005.759999999999
ago

5002.96 --> 5007.6
everybody can do that guess what

5005.76 --> 5009.76
nobody's done that

5007.6 --> 5010.639
why do you think that is why do you

5009.76 --> 5014.8
think that is

5010.639 --> 5018.400000000001
could it be cause there is no moon

5014.8 --> 5022.2390000000005
signal rebounds it's just [ __ ]

5018.4 --> 5024.719
it's a lie a lie

5022.239 --> 5025.919999999999
people that claim that are either really

5024.719 --> 5030.32
stupid and gullible

5025.92 --> 5033.52
or they are disgusting liars

5030.32 --> 5035.92
yeah because if it was possible

5033.52 --> 5037.84
you could do the setup and you could put

5035.92 --> 5040.08
it on camera exactly

5037.84 --> 5041.12
the way i described exactly no

5040.08 --> 5043.92
alteration

5041.12 --> 5045.5199999999995
exactly the way i described it you have

5043.92 --> 5049.4400000000005
three cameras

5045.52 --> 5052.56
yeah three no less three cameras

5049.44 --> 5056.239
one camera is on the

5052.56 --> 5058.2390000000005
aiming device for the signal the device

5056.239 --> 5059.36
that's going to aim the signal towards

5058.239 --> 5060.879999999999
the moon

5059.36 --> 5062.48
right there's going to be a camera on

5060.88 --> 5065.76
top of it so that you can

5062.48 --> 5067.5199999999995
as you aim the thing see the moon

5065.76 --> 5070.56
in front of it that's going to

5067.52 --> 5074.2390000000005
supposedly bounce the signal right

5070.56 --> 5077.52
then you got a camera on a computer

5074.239 --> 5080.638999999999
read out that shows you

5077.52 --> 5082.2390000000005
when the signal is being received back

5080.639 --> 5084.08
from a bounce

5082.239 --> 5085.678999999999
and you could even aim it at a wall and

5084.08 --> 5087.6
then see oh you see it's being bounced

5085.679 --> 5090.4
back from the wall it's registering

5087.6 --> 5091.84
a camera directly on that and then you

5090.4 --> 5095.5199999999995
take a camera

5091.84 --> 5098.159000000001
you take it in the back and you show

5095.52 --> 5099.52
the computer screen readout and the

5098.159 --> 5102.159
person holding the

5099.52 --> 5103.52
radio signal aiming device with the

5102.159 --> 5106.32
cameras on it

5103.52 --> 5106.96
in one shot and then you put all three

5106.32 --> 5110.84
cameras

5106.96 --> 5114.159
into one singular video live

5110.84 --> 5116.0
parallel and then you go aim that thing

5114.159 --> 5117.199
at the moon and see if there's a signal

5116.0 --> 5119.36
rebound oh there's not

5117.199 --> 5121.28
oh aiming at the wall let's see if this

5119.36 --> 5123.36
works oh yeah there is a signal rebound

5121.28 --> 5124.5599999999995
go away again oh no more signal rebound

5123.36 --> 5127.759999999999
yeah that's

5124.56 --> 5128.719
life empirical testing that would be

5127.76 --> 5131.1990000000005
evidence

5128.719 --> 5133.28
yeah i explained it a couple of times

5131.199 --> 5136.239
it's been out there for years now

5133.28 --> 5138.08
there is no video of this no video

5136.239 --> 5140.0
nobody's done it

5138.08 --> 5141.199
you could have done it you've had years

5140.0 --> 5144.08
to do this

5141.199 --> 5144.5599999999995
right no no instead we're going to be

5144.08 --> 5147.5199999999995
told

5144.56 --> 5148.159000000001
by ball believers no no you just need to

5147.52 --> 5150.88
go

5148.159 --> 5152.5599999999995
to one of these special people that have

5150.88 --> 5154.8
the devices that prove this

5152.56 --> 5155.92
then you can walk with them inside of a

5154.8 --> 5160.08
building

5155.92 --> 5163.36
so they can show you the pre-fabricated

5160.08 --> 5165.199
setup right not on the spot no

5163.36 --> 5166.96
empirical wall street no it's just the

5165.199 --> 5168.96
thing the technological thing

5166.96 --> 5170.56
that's going to have a screen that tells

5168.96 --> 5173.6
you it is there

5170.56 --> 5174.56
there's no alteration no alteration of

5173.6 --> 5177.6
the signal

5174.56 --> 5180.56
no it's just a thing that tells you

5177.6 --> 5181.1990000000005
it's being rebound that's it that's all

5180.56 --> 5184.56
they got

5181.199 --> 5186.719
they have no empirical evidence that a

5184.56 --> 5187.679
signal can bounce off the moon

5186.719 --> 5189.6
whatsoever

5187.679 --> 5191.1990000000005
and they should have it because they

5189.6 --> 5194.8
claim that it can

5191.199 --> 5195.759999999999
yeah they don't they don't have the

5194.8 --> 5198.88
evidence

5195.76 --> 5199.84
i've told people on the internet through

5198.88 --> 5202.56
my channel

5199.84 --> 5204.400000000001
through other channels exactly what they

5202.56 --> 5206.88
would need to do

5204.4 --> 5207.839999999999
in order to actually provide evidence

5206.88 --> 5209.36
yeah

5207.84 --> 5211.28
and then everybody can repeat that it's

5209.36 --> 5212.48
not that difficult to have a computer

5211.28 --> 5215.599999999999
screen

5212.48 --> 5218.32
a couple of basic cameras

5215.6 --> 5219.84
and a ham radio and then do it it's not

5218.32 --> 5223.199
difficult

5219.84 --> 5224.96
if it was actually possible but

5223.199 --> 5226.638999999999
i don't think it is possible otherwise

5224.96 --> 5227.6
we've seen all these videos on the

5226.639 --> 5230.2390000000005
internet and then

5227.6 --> 5232.4800000000005
yeah look at stupid flat earthers they

5230.239 --> 5236.239
thought it wasn't possible

5232.48 --> 5238.159
well there isn't any there's no videos

5236.239 --> 5240.638999999999
like that

5238.159 --> 5240.638999999999
too bad

5247.84 --> 5251.04
yeah i know they doubt that i know i

5250.159 --> 5253.36
even exist

5251.04 --> 5255.199
and yeah you guys aren't gonna help

5253.36 --> 5257.5199999999995
either right

5255.199 --> 5259.199
you need to contain arwin you're not

5257.52 --> 5262.4800000000005
gonna

5259.199 --> 5264.799999999999
spread that message right now you're

5262.48 --> 5266.718999999999
just gonna say oh arwen you're so stupid

5264.8 --> 5268.719
or when you're so stupid

5266.719 --> 5270.2390000000005
you don't know anything and then you're

5268.719 --> 5273.44
not

5270.239 --> 5275.44
gonna actually forward the information

5273.44 --> 5277.12
of how it could be proven to people that

5275.44 --> 5277.919999999999
could actually do it now you'd like to

5277.12 --> 5280.719
contain it

5277.92 --> 5282.159
let's not spread it around let's not get

5280.719 --> 5284.639
people the idea

5282.159 --> 5285.759999999999
that they could actually test things in

5284.639 --> 5288.32
a valid way

5285.76 --> 5289.280000000001
don't want to spread that right you keep

5288.32 --> 5292.4
it contained so

5289.28 --> 5294.4
you can just poo-poo me all day long and

5292.4 --> 5296.879999999999
nobody has to hear about it

5294.4 --> 5297.5199999999995
right keep everybody ignorant yeah yeah

5296.88 --> 5300.0
i know

5297.52 --> 5300.0
i know

5305.199 --> 5308.638999999999
i don't need proof you do no it's not my

5308.159 --> 5311.759999999999
claim

5308.639 --> 5314.8
i'm not claiming this the moon can

5311.76 --> 5315.4400000000005
rebound the radio signal that's part of

5314.8 --> 5323.84
your claim

5315.44 --> 5323.839999999999
tiny wobble or you don't claim that

5324.159 --> 5327.199
i don't know you don't have to claim it

5326.239 --> 5329.12
but it is

5327.199 --> 5337.199
claimed though right the moon's

5329.12 --> 5342.96
supposedly physical so

5337.199 --> 5342.96
hey steamy traveler are all what fake

5348.84 --> 5351.84
what

5361.04 --> 5368.56
my long-term goal

5364.96 --> 5368.56
my long-term goal is to

5370.0 --> 5375.52
stop being poor for starters

5373.04 --> 5377.84
it is to improve the quality of my

5375.52 --> 5381.120000000001
communication

5377.84 --> 5385.12
is to better deal with and resolve the

5381.12 --> 5387.199
psychological warfare side effects

5385.12 --> 5389.04
because it's been quite stressful

5387.199 --> 5391.04
especially in the start i'm doing a lot

5389.04 --> 5393.36
better and i'm going to continue that

5391.04 --> 5396.56
progression

5393.36 --> 5398.639
and within the fe community i i

5396.56 --> 5399.92
just like to be taken seriously and not

5398.639 --> 5403.36
ignored

5399.92 --> 5407.76
yeah because i really

5403.36 --> 5409.36
hate being ignored being brushed past

5407.76 --> 5411.1990000000005
because somebody has a bigger channel

5409.36 --> 5414.32
and they're more popey

5411.199 --> 5417.759999999999
oh look at how popular you are yeah

5414.32 --> 5421.12
i don't like that at all so what i want

5417.76 --> 5424.88
is to be taken serious and

5421.12 --> 5428.639
also just people come to me you have a

5424.88 --> 5428.639
question you want to work something out

5429.12 --> 5436.5599999999995
come to me i answer questions

5432.719 --> 5438.159
that's what i do psychological warfare

5436.56 --> 5441.280000000001
oh you betcha

5438.159 --> 5443.36
rufus and hubbins psychological warfare

5441.28 --> 5445.92
is the foundation

5443.36 --> 5446.5599999999995
of what globals do the real globers not

5445.92 --> 5448.32
just

5446.56 --> 5450.080000000001
random people that happen to believe in

5448.32 --> 5451.04
the globe because that that's what they

5450.08 --> 5453.84
were taught

5451.04 --> 5455.76
are the people that double down that's

5453.84 --> 5458.88
psychological warfare

5455.76 --> 5462.159000000001
gaslighting straw manning

5458.88 --> 5465.28
red herring scatter gunning rhombusing

5462.159 --> 5469.28
yeah that's all psychological warfare

5465.28 --> 5472.32
to deter the facts

5469.28 --> 5474.239
and arguments from coming across and

5472.32 --> 5477.28
being communicated properly

5474.239 --> 5478.08
that's called psychological warfare it

5477.28 --> 5491.84
is

5478.08 --> 5491.84
that's exactly what it is

5502.84 --> 5505.84
so

5530.84 --> 5533.84
hmm

5536.48 --> 5540.638999999999
all right yeah hey and if somebody on

5538.88 --> 5542.639
the scene doesn't like me

5540.639 --> 5544.88
why don't you tell me why don't you tell

5542.639 --> 5545.4400000000005
me exactly why you don't like me why

5544.88 --> 5549.6
don't you

5545.44 --> 5552.32
lay it out flat earthers out there

5549.6 --> 5554.08
share your pain you know flat earthers

5552.32 --> 5557.04
can share their pain

5554.08 --> 5559.5199999999995
with me just as much just because i

5557.04 --> 5562.48
happen to be on your side

5559.52 --> 5563.280000000001
does doesn't mean that you have to fall

5562.48 --> 5565.12
in line

5563.28 --> 5567.679
like it's some political struggle or

5565.12 --> 5570.159
whatever no screw that

5567.679 --> 5571.6
you just freaking say exactly how it is

5570.159 --> 5573.36
why don't you get honest with yourself

5571.6 --> 5575.04
stop being politicized

5573.36 --> 5576.48
because another group are just a bunch

5575.04 --> 5580.719
of maniacs

5576.48 --> 5584.4
political demons that's not the cue

5580.719 --> 5584.4
to start doing it yourself

5585.36 --> 5589.759999999999
why don't you just tell it how it is get

5588.48 --> 5592.08
real you don't like me

5589.76 --> 5592.96
tell me you don't like me i dare you

5592.08 --> 5596.159
just freaking

5592.96 --> 5598.88
say it i don't like arwen just say it

5596.159 --> 5601.12
and then tell me why what i'm a little

5598.88 --> 5603.12
too loud i'm a little too direct

5601.12 --> 5604.159
i can get very harsh i can get very

5603.12 --> 5608.239
angry oh yeah

5604.159 --> 5611.36
yeah i can but i'm also never stopping

5608.239 --> 5614.12
and i also have a huge grip

5611.36 --> 5615.599999999999
on the situation psychologically

5614.12 --> 5619.199
cosmogonically

5615.6 --> 5620.0
spatially visually i have a giant grip

5619.199 --> 5623.12
on it and i'm

5620.0 --> 5624.0
very proficient right so hey maybe

5623.12 --> 5627.12
you're jealous

5624.0 --> 5629.6
maybe you feel that i would my presence

5627.12 --> 5630.96
in what you do would kind of elbow you

5629.6 --> 5634.2390000000005
to the side

5630.96 --> 5637.52
right that's a legitimate concern

5634.239 --> 5640.32
because i can't be kind of dominating

5637.52 --> 5642.0
and i i'd agree like hey if you're like

5640.32 --> 5643.679
kind of new on the scene

5642.0 --> 5646.239
yeah the freaking are arwin in the way

5643.679 --> 5647.1990000000005
is just gonna swipe you to the side by

5646.239 --> 5649.839999999999
accident

5647.199 --> 5651.678999999999
and i'm sorry if that happens right i

5649.84 --> 5654.88
get that

5651.679 --> 5658.4800000000005
don't hold your tongue if there's an

5654.88 --> 5661.92
issue communicate it don't

5658.48 --> 5665.36
be a [ __ ] don't make yourself

5661.92 --> 5670.159
ignorant and try to forget it

5665.36 --> 5672.96
confront get real communicate

5670.159 --> 5673.679
all this ignorance and silence is not

5672.96 --> 5687.84
gonna get

5673.679 --> 5687.84
anyone anywhere

5690.639 --> 5693.679
yeah sleeping warrior

5694.08 --> 5700.0
supernatural topic it is a complicated

5698.84 --> 5702.4800000000005
topic

5700.0 --> 5704.48
got stuck with the gas pressure point

5702.48 --> 5705.04
right yeah well when you get stuck in

5704.48 --> 5708.959999999999
logic

5705.04 --> 5711.04
and you cannot get over that threshold

5708.96 --> 5712.56
and to the other side and take the pain

5711.04 --> 5714.48
and then transform

5712.56 --> 5717.119000000001
then it's not surprising that people

5714.48 --> 5720.159
would go to the mysterious supernatural

5717.119 --> 5722.239
or whatever because

5720.159 --> 5725.599999999999
that doesn't directly involve the

5722.239 --> 5729.839999999999
physical things you can't resolve

5725.6 --> 5729.84
you know it's not surprising

5754.8 --> 5760.08
yeah in france you missed a lot

5757.84 --> 5762.88
it was a good show today i think put

5760.08 --> 5771.84
down a whole bunch of things that i'm

5762.88 --> 5771.84
thought were very good

5782.84 --> 5787.6
hmm

5785.199 --> 5787.599999999999
right

5796.32 --> 5800.4
all right glad you like me andy franza

5804.56 --> 5807.92
at least you seem to be able to kind of

5806.4 --> 5808.799999999999
hold your tongue when it's really

5807.92 --> 5811.119
important

5808.8 --> 5812.0
and i appreciate that i know as a baller

5811.119 --> 5815.199
that can be very

5812.0 --> 5827.84
tough other people were not so

5815.199 --> 5827.839999999999
proficient at it

5833.52 --> 5841.84
wow my chat is buzzing today

5860.88 --> 5867.4400000000005
could it be that you would just

5864.32 --> 5869.199
say it's fake because it is

5867.44 --> 5872.4
you're complaining about something you

5869.199 --> 5872.4
basically already know

5872.639 --> 5883.84
is that is that our problem or is that

5875.199 --> 5883.839999999999
your problem

5891.52 --> 5894.639
hey getting wisdom

5894.719 --> 5902.88
hierarchy gradient cross to bear

5899.119 --> 5904.96
i wouldn't express to be very popular or

5902.88 --> 5911.84
materially wealthy yeah

5904.96 --> 5911.84
that's correct

5950.84 --> 5953.84
hmm

5954.0 --> 5959.84
all right so i've got 15 more minutes

5956.639 --> 5964.2390000000005
till i'm gonna run out the show

5959.84 --> 5966.32
oh i had so much conversation already

5964.239 --> 5967.599999999999
i was kind of ready for a break and i'm

5966.32 --> 5971.84
hungry

5967.6 --> 5971.84
because i did get up really early today

5972.32 --> 5978.799999999999
i put my alarm clock at 9 30.

5975.679 --> 5981.84
i even woke up before that right

5978.8 --> 5981.84
because of my appointment

5982.88 --> 5995.84
oh i'm getting quite hungry

6013.92 --> 6020.159
hmm blue marble 2

6017.679 --> 6021.52
computer generated artist conception is

6020.159 --> 6023.92
it i don't know

6021.52 --> 6026.2390000000005
exactly which picture or image you're

6023.92 --> 6028.4
talking about iron fe

6026.239 --> 6030.08
but i did think that like the original

6028.4 --> 6033.119
blue marble

6030.08 --> 6033.679
that it was pho it wasn't photoshop it

6033.119 --> 6037.119
was

6033.679 --> 6038.2390000000005
like lens trickery they just created a

6037.119 --> 6040.239
special lens kind

6038.239 --> 6042.4
to make it and they could only really

6040.239 --> 6044.5599999999995
successfully do it from a very specific

6042.4 --> 6046.32
angle and position and all that

6044.56 --> 6047.679
but i thought that it was actually

6046.32 --> 6050.719
technically a photograph

6047.679 --> 6053.6
that one just the one

6050.719 --> 6054.0
but i might be incorrect about that it's

6053.6 --> 6056.96
a

6054.0 --> 6056.96
little complicated

6057.119 --> 6060.96
i'm not sure i remember even being in

6060.48 --> 6063.199
school

6060.96 --> 6064.0
and having put that picture in front of

6063.199 --> 6067.04
me and i was like

6064.0 --> 6068.159
is this what what is this why do you why

6067.04 --> 6070.159
are you showing me this

6068.159 --> 6072.4
i was like that like why are you showing

6070.159 --> 6079.839999999999
me that

6072.4 --> 6079.839999999999
kind of weirded me out

6081.76 --> 6088.2390000000005
oh really paul gaston no no it's just

6086.159 --> 6090.96
if you can actually give a legitimate

6088.239 --> 6094.32
reason or complain about something

6090.96 --> 6096.639
and not be a total dick about it

6094.32 --> 6099.04
then i'll just let you say that if you

6096.639 --> 6099.6
got a legitimate remark but if it's just

6099.04 --> 6102.639
your

6099.6 --> 6103.92
personal little feely hurty yeah and

6102.639 --> 6105.28
you're gonna be a troll yeah

6103.92 --> 6107.6
of course i'm gonna ban you what do you

6105.28 --> 6110.639
expect yeah already said

6107.6 --> 6113.4400000000005
legitimate complaints actual arguments

6110.639 --> 6116.88
or just being honest about hey i

6113.44 --> 6116.879999999999
personally don't like you

6117.199 --> 6123.759999999999
and why yeah that's okay if you're

6120.48 --> 6126.0
just gonna be a dick yeah i'm gonna kick

6123.76 --> 6126.0
you

6127.52 --> 6135.84
that's how it works

6145.04 --> 6148.159
original blue marble was taken with the

6147.119 --> 6150.719
hasselblad

6148.159 --> 6153.04
analog camera right with a lot of

6150.719 --> 6155.04
modifications i think

6153.04 --> 6157.119
it's not just the basic camera they use

6155.04 --> 6163.84
they did a whole bunch of lenses

6157.119 --> 6163.839999999999
with that thing

6188.84 --> 6191.84
hmm

6197.84 --> 6205.6
your equatorial mount and how it simply

6200.96 --> 6208.08
cannot work in a flat earth hole

6205.6 --> 6208.88
sorry but every single freaking time

6208.08 --> 6211.119
anybody

6208.88 --> 6213.4400000000005
in the world says this cannot work on a

6211.119 --> 6215.36
flat earth you're just wrong

6213.44 --> 6216.879999999999
it's just you not understanding how

6215.36 --> 6218.159
physics work because you've been

6216.88 --> 6221.28
indoctrinated

6218.159 --> 6223.839999999999
with ball machination physics that is

6221.28 --> 6226.239
complete [ __ ]

6223.84 --> 6228.0
that's the problem every time somebody

6226.239 --> 6229.599999999999
says this can't work on a flat earth

6228.0 --> 6232.0
it's just wrong

6229.6 --> 6233.6
stupid everything can work on a flat

6232.0 --> 6236.56
earth everything

6233.6 --> 6237.92
everything that's work that is real

6236.56 --> 6241.119000000001
works on a flat earth

6237.92 --> 6241.76
everything that's real works on a flat

6241.119 --> 6246.08
earth

6241.76 --> 6261.280000000001
you know why because the earth is flat

6246.08 --> 6263.679
deal with it

6261.28 --> 6265.199
it's not it's not even up for the bait

6263.679 --> 6269.04
anymore really the earth

6265.199 --> 6271.759999999999
is flat it's flat the debate is not

6269.04 --> 6273.119
on whether it is flatterable it's just

6271.76 --> 6276.159000000001
flat

6273.119 --> 6279.36
and we're trying to figure out the other

6276.159 --> 6280.5599999999995
aspects you know we're trying to figure

6279.36 --> 6283.679
out like what else

6280.56 --> 6285.04
is the earth besides flat which is

6283.679 --> 6286.96
absolutely proven

6285.04 --> 6289.119
yeah there's no curvature black swan

6286.96 --> 6291.199
absolutely disproves any spherical

6289.119 --> 6293.199
geometry right and we have gas pressure

6291.199 --> 6294.239
which means there's no outer space or we

6293.199 --> 6297.599999999999
wouldn't be breathing

6294.239 --> 6301.36
ever yeah it's over there is nothing

6297.6 --> 6303.84
you can do about it the earth is flat

6301.36 --> 6305.04
but there's more to figure out besides

6303.84 --> 6307.360000000001
just that

6305.04 --> 6308.08
and if you're only here to hang on to

6307.36 --> 6310.4
your ball

6308.08 --> 6312.4
and deny the blatant evidence if you're

6310.4 --> 6315.5199999999995
just waiting for your opportunity

6312.4 --> 6319.44
to reassert your conditioned responses

6315.52 --> 6323.040000000001
to reinforce the absolute blatant lie

6319.44 --> 6328.4
that the earth is a ball then

6323.04 --> 6328.4
why are you here stop wasting my time

6329.36 --> 6333.04
right if you're interested in things if

6331.52 --> 6334.719
you actually want to figure out how

6333.04 --> 6336.08
things work then you're perfectly

6334.719 --> 6337.92
welcome even if you have your

6336.08 --> 6339.36
reservations about the shape of the

6337.92 --> 6339.84
earth or what could it be and there are

6339.36 --> 6341.28
probably

6339.84 --> 6343.04
things being held back and blah blah

6341.28 --> 6346.4
blah blah right

6343.04 --> 6348.0
but if you're just here to say it's not

6346.4 --> 6351.36
flat you have no proof

6348.0 --> 6353.44
it's flat yeah get the [ __ ] out i don't

6351.36 --> 6354.48
want to deal with you bunch of funny

6353.44 --> 6357.199
idiots

6354.48 --> 6358.32
yeah i don't care for your stupid little

6357.199 --> 6361.36
conditioning it's

6358.32 --> 6363.44
your problem you're being a neurotic

6361.36 --> 6365.839999999999
idiot and i don't give a [ __ ]

6363.44 --> 6367.599999999999
about what you think stop getting in my

6365.84 --> 6369.6
way piss off

6367.6 --> 6371.04
right but if you're here to actually

6369.6 --> 6374.4800000000005
figure things out

6371.04 --> 6376.88
and to learn about reality

6374.48 --> 6377.919999999999
from a lot of different angles or if you

6376.88 --> 6381.1990000000005
just need

6377.92 --> 6382.96
that final piece of technical evidence

6381.199 --> 6386.0
something you can do

6382.96 --> 6389.36
to kind of get the reinsurance you need

6386.0 --> 6391.679
to defend against other zealots that are

6389.36 --> 6392.48
nagging you how don't you dare go to

6391.679 --> 6394.88
flat earth

6392.48 --> 6396.159
don't you dare go to flat earth right if

6394.88 --> 6399.6
you need it for that

6396.159 --> 6401.599999999999
then you're perfectly welcome

6399.6 --> 6403.52
because i am for that that's what i'm

6401.6 --> 6405.679
here for to help you out

6403.52 --> 6407.679
against the zealots but if you are a

6405.679 --> 6410.2390000000005
zealot just waiting for the opportunity

6407.679 --> 6415.04
to assert your neurotically programmed

6410.239 --> 6428.48
disproven nonsense just get the [ __ ] out

6415.04 --> 6430.639
right it's not this place is not for you

6428.48 --> 6433.759999999999
hello julio pabin by the way good

6430.639 --> 6437.119
morning to you

6433.76 --> 6443.84
you're late i'm gonna round out

6437.119 --> 6443.839999999999
in like five minutes

6454.32 --> 6457.84
issan in the wrong saloon i don't know

6456.32 --> 6471.84
is he what did he say

6457.84 --> 6471.84
he just retracted that

6481.92 --> 6488.719
oh my god no voice of reason

6485.6 --> 6490.56
no it shouldn't even be physically

6488.719 --> 6493.04
possible how can you be so

6490.56 --> 6495.04
dumb to think that you can bounce a

6493.04 --> 6498.0
signal off the sun

6495.04 --> 6499.119
for crying out loud have you not paid

6498.0 --> 6502.719
attention

6499.119 --> 6506.239
ever like do you even know what the sun

6502.719 --> 6509.52
does you know what the sun is infamous

6506.239 --> 6514.239
infamous for distorting

6509.52 --> 6516.719
signals remember oh solar flare oh look

6514.239 --> 6517.36
yeah the electric net is being bothered

6516.719 --> 6520.4
or there's

6517.36 --> 6521.759999999999
distortions in the radio system yeah

6520.4 --> 6523.5199999999995
yeah what's good what do you think is

6521.76 --> 6527.119000000001
going to happen when you send a

6523.52 --> 6529.360000000001
radio signal to the sun yeah it's gonna

6527.119 --> 6530.719
get closer to the sun right

6529.36 --> 6533.839999999999
what's gonna happen then yeah it's gonna

6530.719 --> 6535.119
distort the notion that you could bounce

6533.84 --> 6538.32
a radius signal

6535.119 --> 6541.5199999999995
of the sun is preposterous from

6538.32 --> 6544.239
every conceivable angle even if you're a

6541.52 --> 6546.080000000001
full believer in heliocentrism for

6544.239 --> 6550.48
crying out loud

6546.08 --> 6555.84
it's so dumb can't you just see it

6550.48 --> 6555.839999999999
my god

6556.239 --> 6560.48
yeah and the ball of gas but not just

6558.639 --> 6563.679
that it's like

6560.48 --> 6564.48
what is the sun known for solar flares

6563.679 --> 6567.36
heat right

6564.48 --> 6570.0
solar flares the activity of the sun

6567.36 --> 6573.598999999999
distorts radio signals

6570.0 --> 6575.599
there is no freaking way in hell ever

6573.599 --> 6577.76
you could bounce the radio signal off

6575.599 --> 6581.76
it's so preposterous

6577.76 --> 6582.96
it's so dumb can't believe that actually

6581.76 --> 6585.04
echoes out there

6582.96 --> 6597.84
that people don't see it for what it is

6585.04 --> 6597.84
it's so stupid to say that

6602.48 --> 6611.839999999999
thanks for trying though

6612.8 --> 6619.1990000000005
maybe the paper oh a paper you say

6616.4 --> 6621.679
well maybe the paper should just go into

6619.199 --> 6625.5199999999995
the garbage disposal

6621.679 --> 6629.36
or maybe like a bin with fire in there

6625.52 --> 6633.040000000001
it's total nonsense from 1960 yeah

6629.36 --> 6637.36
in the trash in the trash it's fraud

6633.04 --> 6641.679
it's ridiculous it's

6637.36 --> 6641.679
really really stupid

6645.36 --> 6649.36
so how are the radio signals being

6647.599 --> 6652.8
returned

6649.36 --> 6656.4
oh you're asking me

6652.8 --> 6658.56
uh well it's not being returned because

6656.4 --> 6660.0
it's bouncing off the sun because before

6658.56 --> 6662.400000000001
it would reach the sun

6660.0 --> 6663.28
it would be completely distorted and

6662.4 --> 6665.92
destroyed

6663.28 --> 6667.84
there would be no coherent radio signal

6665.92 --> 6671.119
to return

6667.84 --> 6671.679
who gives a [ __ ] why you get a signal

6671.119 --> 6675.839999999999
return

6671.679 --> 6678.56
it's not my problem there shouldn't be

6675.84 --> 6680.32
a signal return it's a freaking sun it's

6678.56 --> 6684.2390000000005
a fiery ball of gas

6680.32 --> 6688.5599999999995
that constantly distorts radio signals

6684.239 --> 6688.5599999999995
for crying out loud how many times

6692.4 --> 6695.759999999999
yeah and with the signals of the moon

6694.0 --> 6698.8
it's another story there's

6695.76 --> 6702.159000000001
there's ways to test it at least in

6698.8 --> 6705.679
theory it should be sort of possible

6702.159 --> 6708.879999999999
right it should be sort of

6705.679 --> 6711.76
possible within heliocentric conception

6708.88 --> 6712.159000000001
with the radio signal on the moon yeah

6711.76 --> 6714.4800000000005
that

6712.159 --> 6715.44
should have sort sort of should be

6714.48 --> 6718.48
possible

6715.44 --> 6719.199
in theory and it should be testable the

6718.48 --> 6722.718999999999
sun

6719.199 --> 6723.598999999999
oh my god like in the model it can't

6722.719 --> 6725.92
work

6723.599 --> 6726.639
for crying out loud don't make me repeat

6725.92 --> 6728.639
this [ __ ]

6726.639 --> 6730.96
i don't give a [ __ ] if there's a paper

6728.639 --> 6733.28
that says it in 1960 or whatever it's

6730.96 --> 6737.84
not possible it's ridiculous to assume

6733.28 --> 6737.84
that it's possible

6740.8 --> 6744.8
right but i'm rounding out the show so

6743.199 --> 6746.719
thanks everyone for coming

6744.8 --> 6748.320000000001
i hope you liked this show i certainly

6746.719 --> 6748.96
did i thought this was probably one of

6748.32 --> 6752.719
my best

6748.96 --> 6754.8
shows maybe ever

6752.719 --> 6756.32
nah probably not but it was really good

6754.8 --> 6759.1990000000005
though

6756.32 --> 6761.04
and if you liked it too and you haven't

6759.199 --> 6764.0
seen the entire thing then just

6761.04 --> 6765.599
watch it back after i'm rounding out

6764.0 --> 6767.28
because it was a really good show

6765.599 --> 6769.119000000001
overall all these two hours i thought

6767.28 --> 6769.759999999999
that every minute was well spent this

6769.119 --> 6772.719
time

6769.76 --> 6773.360000000001
i'm very proud of that if you liked it

why did you do that i'm taking your

6812.56 --> 6815.1990000000005
wrench away

6815.52 --> 6821.84
that's why did you do that

6828.239 --> 6832.718999999999
you don't do that here yeah bear no bear

6832.159 --> 6838.08
you don't

6832.719 --> 6838.08
ban anybody i ban people

6839.04 --> 6843.119
right that's not what the wrench is for

6840.56 --> 6845.52
the wrench is for trolls only

6843.119 --> 6847.199
not somebody saying something ridiculous

6845.52 --> 6850.56
or stupid

6847.199 --> 6852.08
only trolls only sock spamming trolls

6850.56 --> 6854.080000000001
that's the only time you can actually

6852.08 --> 6856.48
use the wrench

6854.08 --> 6857.679
right don't do that again well you can't

6856.48 --> 6859.04
now because you don't have a wrench

6857.679 --> 6861.679
anymore

6859.04 --> 6864.159
but anyway i will be back tomorrow flat

6861.679 --> 6865.4400000000005

6864.159 --> 6867.5199999999995
and i'm going to join the flat earth

6865.44 --> 6869.598999999999
debates which should start at any second

6867.52 --> 6876.650000000001
now

6869.599 --> 6901.979
until the next video keep it flat
