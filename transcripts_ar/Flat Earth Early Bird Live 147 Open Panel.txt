36.85 --> 44.480000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.61 --> 49.879
early-bird number 147 I'm your host

44.48 --> 51.949
Arwen and today is a yeah not so sunny a

49.879 --> 54.079
bit a little bit more cloudy day it's

51.949 --> 59.89
still kind of warm though but not so

54.079 --> 65.539
much it's dry yeah that's all right

59.89 --> 68.6
could be a lot worse yeah still feels

65.539 --> 74.619
like spring Spring has definitely

68.6 --> 80.6
arrived so are you guys all doing

74.619 --> 82.94
Michael Roark 101 rockhound hm uber

Mukul a tube tinkerer a little bit

82.94 --> 94.509
earlier it'll be back I presume so yeah

90.55 --> 98.689
this can potentially be a long Saturday

94.509 --> 99.82900000000001
early bird depending on if I'm gonna get

98.689 --> 102.64999999999999

oh hello an unbelievable production it's

102.65 --> 111.67
good to see you I'm open to guests I'm

107.0 --> 114.649
even at this point considering putting

111.67 --> 120.79
the Hangout link just directly in check

114.649 --> 123.14
I think I can control that process now

120.79 --> 126.399
I'm not really scared of the ballers

123.14 --> 134.38
anymore so I'm gonna try that out

126.399 --> 134.38
hello truth-seeker mafia so yeah

142.75 --> 149.53
yeah remember that if you're gonna troll

144.91 --> 151.29999999999998
it or do anything disruptive I can

149.53 --> 154.71
always just close off the panel and

151.3 --> 162.07000000000002
start a new one it's not that hard so

154.71 --> 166.75
hello Brendan cook now I'm not gonna put

162.07 --> 169.20999999999998
YouTube thinker that requires a special

166.75 --> 173.17
kind of behavior and if you want to

169.21 --> 175.99
behave and just be you that's fine I'm

173.17 --> 179.95
gonna leave you there if you're gonna

175.99 --> 182.89000000000001
get really annoying disruptive then I

179.95 --> 186.209
will just time you out if you take it

182.89 --> 190.14999999999998
too far out ban you but I don't want to

186.209 --> 194.89000000000001
so yeah hello Chris Matt I'm gonna put

190.15 --> 197.459
out the Hangout link in the open anyone

194.89 --> 197.45899999999997
can join

206.849 --> 216.069
it's a little bit more than just

209.319 --> 217.48
disagreeing you to tinker what yeah I'm

216.069 --> 218.23999999999998
putting it out there we'll see what

217.48 --> 221.69899999999998
happens

218.24 --> 221.699
[Music]

227.02 --> 230.699
[Music]

245.37 --> 258.28000000000003
so can I talk about yeah yesterday iron

253.36 --> 261.25
row media crow triple7 was on it was

258.28 --> 263.46999999999997
surprisingly good actually and yeah the

261.25 --> 270.04
whole Sun part thing that was kind of

263.47 --> 271.78000000000003
exactly what I expected so yeah it

270.04 --> 275.16
pretty much looked from what I got to

271.78 --> 278.5
see you like a holographic side effect

275.16 --> 282.16
that appears under certain circumstances

278.5 --> 284.26
apparently so is said can also even be

282.16 --> 287.53000000000003
seen with the naked eye which is

284.26 --> 293.37
interesting at times it's claimed I

287.53 --> 293.36999999999995
don't know if it's really true but yeah

295.32 --> 304.42
it's funny like crow is really refining

300.94 --> 309.52
the way he says things and connects the

304.42 --> 313.81
dots and I know he's a good storyteller

309.52 --> 317.5
at that and yeah I kind of like it

313.81 --> 322.15
maybe I overplayed the whole gematria

317.5 --> 326.47
thing about him maybe he took a hint at

322.15 --> 330.78
it I don't know probably not or maybe

326.47 --> 334.57000000000005
he's just delving into new material and

330.78 --> 336.60999999999996
just like we all have and starting to

334.57 --> 340.84
step away from the old approach and

336.61 --> 342.43
getting more analytical and yeah I don't

340.84 --> 348.09999999999997
know I like I like pretty much

342.43 --> 350.979
everything he had to say yesterday yeah

348.1 --> 353.29
Algrim oh cool I missed it it's well

350.979 --> 355.28999999999996
worth it I run real media just check

353.29 --> 359.88
them out

355.29 --> 359.88
hello ramble jam bug good morning

360.76 --> 367.19
just a reminder to everyone joining and

364.1 --> 371.8
watching there is a direct hangout link

367.19 --> 371.8
in the chat for anyone wants to join

373.03 --> 385.48999999999995
putting it completely open don't even

376.28 --> 388.09999999999997
need to add me on skype for this yes

385.49 --> 390.86
flatter hangouts I do drink a lot of tea

388.1 --> 393.31
green tea especially during the early

390.86 --> 393.31
bird show

398.09 --> 403.56
nope

401.07 --> 407.4
no no Flat Earth debates today only

403.56 --> 412.05
there reruns and of course ball busters

407.4 --> 414.26
this evening and yeah I might also be on

412.05 --> 414.26
there

418.57 --> 426.73
so yeah the whole thing between me and

422.65 --> 429.52
Slick James just keeps on going and it's

426.73 --> 432.19
already starting to bore me really so

429.52 --> 434.44
yeah I could just ramble on about all

432.19 --> 438.73
that and what do you think about this

434.44 --> 441.94
guy and make him look even worse but I

438.73 --> 449.68
feel like that's literally a waste of my

441.94 --> 452.17
potential and skills so I don't know for

449.68 --> 455.8
somebody is supposedly so very spiritual

452.17 --> 459.55
and not a believer of anything seems to

455.8 --> 466.48
get really angry especially at me so I

459.55 --> 468.75
don't know it's just certain get sick of

466.48 --> 468.75
it

478.02 --> 483.75
yeah unbelievable production slick

480.56 --> 491.43
doesn't really even white knight for

483.75 --> 493.41
ballers he's just trying to play both

491.43 --> 495.45
sides off against each other and he's

493.41 --> 497.85
just trying to find sympathy into

495.45 --> 501.84
defending either side and if he happens

497.85 --> 503.85
to criticize ballers which he does

501.84 --> 507.63
regularly especially when it concerns

503.85 --> 513.45
beliefs like the ballers he constantly

507.63 --> 515.91
says that very robotically and then yeah

513.45 --> 517.74
flatter it so say oh yes easy and then

515.91 --> 521.4499999999999
listen at this point but he does the

517.74 --> 524.49
same thing on the other side as well so

521.45 --> 526.7700000000001
slick James is just in it for his own

524.49 --> 529.8
experience and he doesn't like to draw

526.77 --> 534.4499999999999
conclusions because he thinks they are

529.8 --> 539.4599999999999
per definition all based on beliefs so

534.45 --> 543.3900000000001
yeah I don't think he's really white

539.46 --> 547.07
knighting for anyone oh yeah now you got

543.39 --> 547.0699999999999
me talking about him after all

553.05 --> 565.8399999999999
hello metal slugs master the rig truth

560.35 --> 572.64
seeker mafia shrew Minotti

565.84 --> 572.64
oh yeah an age MacLeod of course

579.5 --> 584.39
yeah what else is there

589.08 --> 600.76
what did i do yesterday oh yeah was the

596.56 --> 603.16
Owen Benjamin very late I watched that

600.76 --> 608.26
one stayed up very late this and

603.16 --> 613.3299999999999
yesterday night almost half asleep at

608.26 --> 615.85
the end oh yeah oh that's that's right

613.33 --> 620.38
and lift a veil I watched bit of it

615.85 --> 627.3100000000001
about YouTube censorship of false flags

620.38 --> 629.76
especially Sandy Hook apparently and the

627.31 --> 635.16
whole background about that situation

629.76 --> 641.4399999999999
that was so weird oh and apparently and

635.16 --> 645.6999999999999
this is a bit shocking it is now said

641.44 --> 647.3800000000001
that Randy has actually deleted all his

645.7 --> 651.61
videos have been deleted

647.38 --> 655.02
not not privatized but I haven't heard

651.61 --> 658.6800000000001
from Randy to confirm any of this

655.02 --> 662.53
so I even asked him on skype like yeah

658.68 --> 664.4499999999999
is it true what they say or is it what I

662.53 --> 673.1999999999999
thought it is and not getting any

664.45 --> 673.2
response yeah yeah the last

674.86 --> 684.94
last time he's been on according to

677.08 --> 687.37
Skype was Wednesday yeah I don't know I

684.94 --> 689.3800000000001
don't know what's happened but it's very

687.37 --> 691.63
concerning is he's made a lot of great

689.38 --> 693.459
videos great contributor if he's

691.63 --> 703.899
actually being attacked by YouTube

693.459 --> 706.5999999999999
that's that's quite alarming but I don't

703.899 --> 711.22
know maybe there's some abrupt home

706.6 --> 712.2090000000001
situation and he just like said okay

711.22 --> 714.19
screw that

712.209 --> 718.149
I I don't have time for this anymore I'm

714.19 --> 721.2090000000001
just gonna put it away to deal with this

718.149 --> 722.95
for some period because otherwise he

721.209 --> 724.9899999999999
thinks it's probably gonna take too long

722.95 --> 726.7900000000001
and it's gonna mess up something like

724.99 --> 728.35
that could be a going on as well I don't

726.79 --> 735.149
know we could speculate all day about

728.35 --> 740.13
why ranty been heard from in a while and

735.149 --> 745.529
yeah we'll get to find out eventually

740.13 --> 745.529
what rant these videos are still up

749.99 --> 762.8
last time I checked it wasn't oh wait

755.81 --> 763.31
you're right they roll back huh oh my

762.8 --> 765.4699999999999
god

763.31 --> 768.41
false alarm guys [ __ ] I should have

765.47 --> 770.12
checked it well yeah yesterday evening

768.41 --> 772.39
they were still all gone but apparently

770.12 --> 776.51
they're all back now that's good

772.39 --> 783.279
probably was a what I thought it was

776.51 --> 783.279
good good to hear he's still out there

795.12 --> 803.04
so yeah the panel is still open for

797.519 --> 806.6
anyone who wants to join hang up link

803.04 --> 806.5999999999999
right here in chat

836.02 --> 843.61
what what are you saying faladi bein

839.14 --> 847.029
avakov grantee tricks James Brown into

843.61 --> 849.49
believing in chemtrails how do you mean

847.029 --> 853.56
trick him into believing do you not

849.49 --> 856.36
think chemtrails are real how's that

853.56 --> 860.9699999999999
maybe did it in a bit of a weird way but

856.36 --> 866.83
I don't know tricked people into

860.97 --> 869.62
believing the truth hmm and yeah I do

866.83 --> 871.9590000000001
agree that ranty sometimes get indeed it

869.62 --> 875.02
gets in these moods where he does lack

871.959 --> 878.38
compassion that's true he only does it

875.02 --> 882.73
periodically when he's just in a certain

878.38 --> 891.1
mood it no I've found him to be very

882.73 --> 893.86
compassionate in general so although he

891.1 --> 897.9590000000001
does get very hard on opponents and

893.86 --> 897.9590000000001
perceived proponents like baller so

904.53 --> 914.14
no Juan Carlos very funny no I I didn't

911.92 --> 917.17
say head he couldn't find his channel I

914.14 --> 920.1899999999999
did find his channel it just all his

917.17 --> 920.1899999999999
videos were gone

931.829 --> 943.81
all right Hayes McCloud parent opponents

936.069 --> 946.149
or perceived opponents somebody's only

943.81 --> 952.8889999999999
really opponent if you see them as an

946.149 --> 952.889
opponent and adapt to that approach so

967.23 --> 976.85
that was see that there was Stephen

971.22 --> 976.85
Christ right I don't know

980.79 --> 987.87
I wouldn't mind going into some kind of

984.44 --> 991.32
calm cave versus flatter discussion if

987.87 --> 993.6
people want to do that you know I have

991.32 --> 998.5500000000001
similar arguments as against the globe

993.6 --> 1002.3000000000001
and would be good to hear a contrast the

998.55 --> 1004.5799999999999
technical contrast of how that kill

1002.3 --> 1005.42
caves certainty is supposed to be

1004.58 --> 1009.11
working out

1005.42 --> 1012.7299999999999
and how many presuppositional systems

1009.11 --> 1015.2
and are in there because they are

1012.73 --> 1017.84
absolutely they are a lot of them and

1015.2 --> 1022.3100000000001
very science fictiony stories from what

1017.84 --> 1023.7800000000001
I've heard so but yeah I'm open to

1022.31 --> 1027.6499999999999
discuss anything that's why I put the

1023.78 --> 1028.55
Hangout link open in the chat and I'll

1027.65 --> 1035.02
keep doing that

1028.55 --> 1035.02
oh wait that's not ugly

1081.2 --> 1085.009
[Music]

1087.67 --> 1090.949
[Music]

1103.52 --> 1110.96
know that yeah okay thanks for the

1107.63 --> 1113.3000000000002
update about Lord Steven Christ flooded

1110.96 --> 1115.28
me or Novikov I didn't know I don't keep

1113.3 --> 1118.78
track of him I just know that he's kind

1115.28 --> 1121.91
of a maniac and that he went to jail

1118.78 --> 1126.26
wasn't it for like murder or something I

1121.91 --> 1128.17
don't know creepy stuff and yeah well

1126.26 --> 1132.3799999999999
anyone who seriously thinks that their

1128.17 --> 1138.94
Jesus Christ returned and acts like that

1132.38 --> 1138.94
that's just yeah very blatantly obvious

1139.179 --> 1146.66
as for a concave idea I don't know it's

1143.09 --> 1153.47
just another basic model it's just just

1146.66 --> 1156.3200000000002
like the disc with the dome but yeah not

1153.47 --> 1158.0
flat according to that concept and a lot

1156.32 --> 1164.24
of trouble and a lot of science fiction

1158.0 --> 1168.05
to fill the gaps so I don't know is he

1164.24 --> 1170.39
even like the inventor of it's really or

1168.05 --> 1175.309
did it was he just the most noisy want

1170.39 --> 1178.3400000000001
to be visible on the specific scene

1175.309 --> 1184.04
since it started because I've heard

1178.34 --> 1186.79
concave stories even 15 years back but

1184.04 --> 1189.71
just a story it's not like a person

1186.79 --> 1193.19
specifically pushing a concave model

1189.71 --> 1198.44
it's rather just another presupposition

1193.19 --> 1202.91
within the story context so yeah you

1198.44 --> 1205.49
know Hollow Earth all of Earth is kind

1202.91 --> 1208.0400000000002
of a concave like concept or some of

1205.49 --> 1212.6
them like the Hollow Earth globe is

1208.04 --> 1216.6789999999999
really a globe and concave earth

1212.6 --> 1221.6299999999999
combined it's very weird other works but

1216.679 --> 1224.48
yeah that was there for a long time it's

1221.63 --> 1227.38
one of the first alternative cosmogonic

1224.48 --> 1230.41
concepts that I even entertained before

1227.38 --> 1230.41
Flat Earth

1231.88 --> 1239.2700000000002
like I'm pretty sure that around 2012

1235.97 --> 1241.94
those times and before that even I was

1239.27 --> 1244.61
definitely looking video into videos

1241.94 --> 1250.0700000000002
that talked about Hollow Earth and all

1244.61 --> 1252.6499999999999
that so because it was out there back

1250.07 --> 1255.77
then a lot of it I probably still is

1252.65 --> 1258.4
though but drowning you know all the

1255.77 --> 1258.4
other videos

1267.77 --> 1275.3899999999999
- right unbelievable productions I hear

1270.84 --> 1280.29
he did indeed fill in the gaps

1275.39 --> 1283.98
supposedly of a concave concept as a

1280.29 --> 1287.99
real alternative model so maybe he did

1283.98 --> 1287.99
that and he was the first to do that

1296.78 --> 1299.99
[Music]

1326.96 --> 1331.3700000000001
so yeah who's gonna come on

1343.98 --> 1349.019
yeah you don't I don't necessarily need

1347.039 --> 1353.58
to just have one guest you know you can

1349.019 --> 1356.19
get on there and just talk on my panel

1353.58 --> 1359.039
as you are talking in chat that's all

1356.19 --> 1361.46
fine with me I'm not necessarily in need

1359.039 --> 1365.669
of one specific guest that I'm just

1361.46 --> 1368.8500000000001
gonna interrogate or whatever or have a

1365.669 --> 1376.8890000000001
conversation with so that's why I'm

1368.85 --> 1379.59
putting it out in chat right now and you

1376.889 --> 1382.309
know what share the show and the link

1379.59 --> 1382.309
and whatever

1389.32 --> 1397.4199999999998
right I have mark or wanted to join that

1394.03 --> 1399.79
yeah through Skype he asked so I'm gonna

1397.42 --> 1402.93
give him the link let's see if he

1399.79 --> 1402.93
succeeds in coming on

1419.929 --> 1422.71
right

1438.8 --> 1444.6399999999999
Oh God Oh Nadine thanks for that

1449.11 --> 1454.01
ayyy thank you

1451.22 --> 1457.73
Rambo Jambo for the ten Canadian dollar

1454.01 --> 1459.71
super chat donation keep up the great

1457.73 --> 1463.03
work I will do my best

1459.71 --> 1463.03
Oh what is great

1470.05 --> 1478.32
hmm not right unbelievable productions

1474.13 --> 1485.25
yeah I have done some research on

1478.32 --> 1492.07
Hermeticism and yeah that do seem to be

1485.25 --> 1498.46
like connections to heliocentrism but

1492.07 --> 1502.9299999999998
only because of the ADI the ways of

1498.46 --> 1508.05
thinking the making spectrums out of

1502.93 --> 1513.0700000000002
things and frequencies and just

1508.05 --> 1516.76
systematic I don't know it's so

1513.07 --> 1519.73
systematic there Metis ISM and yeah

1516.76 --> 1522.28
heliocentrism is systematic as well so

1519.73 --> 1530.41
it is kind of like the same building

1522.28 --> 1535.86
blocks you could say same the same

1530.41 --> 1538.39
palette same palette for the painting

1535.86 --> 1540.78
but yeah there I don't think there's a

1538.39 --> 1543.3700000000001
direct connection in the sense that

1540.78 --> 1547.8899999999999
heliocentrism directly came out of her

1543.37 --> 1551.4699999999998
medicine it really is its own thing I

1547.89 --> 1555.8200000000002
remember my first video upload on this

1551.47 --> 1562.8600000000001
channel is is technically about

1555.82 --> 1566.3999999999999
Hermeticism it's a very long video

1562.86 --> 1566.3999999999999
what's it called again

1579.55 --> 1588.79
no wait what's the second one yeah the

1582.429 --> 1592.8000000000002
Cabal Ian by hermus tree megistus which

1588.79 --> 1597.4289999999999
I think supposedly was the founder of

1592.8 --> 1603.49
Hermeticism not a hundred percent sure

1597.429 --> 1606.3700000000001
is such elaborate complex thing that

1603.49 --> 1611.64
basically just got a glimpse of it and

1606.37 --> 1611.6399999999999
some feel for it that's it

1620.6 --> 1627.57
okay the forbidden universe cool is

1623.55 --> 1633.51
there a video of that because I don't

1627.57 --> 1636.78
really like reading books or where is it

1633.51 --> 1640.8
again an audio book kind of like the

1636.78 --> 1645.35
video that I posted from the guy I just

1640.8 --> 1645.35
meant mentioned from Hermes Trismegistus

1653.27 --> 1656.26
hmm

1678.58 --> 1688.85
right okay mark is present at least he's

1686.12 --> 1691.3999999999999
probably having interface problems like

1688.85 --> 1694.1599999999999
he's never tried out Google Hangouts on

1691.4 --> 1699.26
this phone and it's always such a hassle

1694.16 --> 1702.0800000000002
with no people to try to get them on the

1699.26 --> 1713.0
panel and then once they've tried it's

1702.08 --> 1716.78
very easy after that but no there yeah

1713.0 --> 1720.44
thanks unbelievable productions if

1716.78 --> 1725.54
you've got an audio book left love the

1720.44 --> 1727.66
link for that but yeah I'm not all that

1725.54 --> 1733.82
great with reading books especially

1727.66 --> 1735.8300000000002
complex concept your books their own the

1733.82 --> 1738.1699999999998
writers own typical train of thought

1735.83 --> 1740.1499999999999
it's very difficult for me to follow

1738.17 --> 1743.0600000000002
that I really need to hear somebody

1740.15 --> 1745.88
exclaiming like that gets it otherwise

1743.06 --> 1755.8999999999999
I'm just gonna wander off with my mind

1745.88 --> 1757.8400000000001
every page hey that one guy good

1755.9 --> 1762.17
question

1757.84 --> 1765.9199999999998
computer simulation theory I think it's

1762.17 --> 1768.52
extremely unlikely that we're living in

1765.92 --> 1768.52
something like that

1777.56 --> 1785.9199999999998
just think about computers in general

1781.01 --> 1788.54
and how difficult it is to stay

1785.92 --> 1791.75
functioning and yeah think about all

1788.54 --> 1795.46
these people it's like the matrix the

1791.75 --> 1799.97
matrix the literal matrix is kind of

1795.46 --> 1804.3500000000001
well if this was like the matrix in a

1799.97 --> 1808.73
way then we should see serious glitches

1804.35 --> 1813.4399999999998
like in like they displayed in the

1808.73 --> 1818.51
matrix not just like deja vu sort of but

1813.44 --> 1823.8200000000002
like real serious weird physical

1818.51 --> 1827.45
measurable deja vu effects and yeah like

1823.82 --> 1830.4399999999998
electronic visual distortions anything

1827.45 --> 1833.81
like that and we never really see that

1830.44 --> 1837.26
so I think that the world is rather

1833.81 --> 1846.44
similar Tory in nature but it's not a

1837.26 --> 1849.8
digital displayed matrix I think it's

1846.44 --> 1851.5700000000002
yeah let's get a bit philosophical I

1849.8 --> 1854.36
think and I thought this in the Matrix

1851.57 --> 1859.8999999999999
movie as well I wasn't alone in this

1854.36 --> 1864.86
like the matrix is a digital sub realm

1859.9 --> 1869.7800000000002
simulation but the real world is in its

1864.86 --> 1877.1899999999998
own way the same thing to the Creator so

1869.78 --> 1880.3899999999999
it is the creator simulation and but not

1877.19 --> 1880.39
electronic based

1884.15 --> 1901.7900000000002
not just bypass observatory census but

1895.72 --> 1904.79
rather just the spirit itself the

1901.79 --> 1909.02
conscious itself that's what the god

1904.79 --> 1911.42
simulator mostly interacts with from

1909.02 --> 1914.24
yeah from the other side I don't know it

1911.42 --> 1917.0
is it's very sounds a bit vague

1914.24 --> 1920.36
especially when I don't explain it all

1917.0 --> 1922.84
that well but yeah I do think that the

1920.36 --> 1926.35
world is civil Ettore but it is not a

1922.84 --> 1926.35
computer simulation

1932.65 --> 1937.3000000000002
jazakallah you don't have an

1934.31 --> 1937.3
understanding of anything

1961.06 --> 1963.8999999999999
hmm

1966.929 --> 1974.009
right Oh Chris Matt to say matrix copied

1971.549 --> 1976.83
it I don't know I don't think so but it

1974.009 --> 1981.479
it is inspired and it does lie in the

1976.83 --> 1985.259
same direction it's in the the

1981.479 --> 1989.279
transhumanist direction and while one

1985.259 --> 1991.95
deals with or they're both about

1989.279 --> 1996.269
cybernetics the matrix is about

1991.95 --> 1999.1190000000001
cybernetics as in a fake reality created

1996.269 --> 2004.219
digitally and ghost in the shell is

1999.119 --> 2008.4499999999998
about transcending biological human

2004.219 --> 2011.21
nature and uniting physically with the

2008.45 --> 2014.599
the real life consciousness physically

2011.21 --> 2025.999
with the machine so it's both the same

2014.599 --> 2030.559
yeah transhumanist is it so yeah like

2025.999 --> 2032.809
the cyborg the zhaibar cult you could

2030.559 --> 2035.059
call it that that that philosophy to

2032.809 --> 2039.109
unite with machine somehow it's both in

2035.059 --> 2043.099
some same category but it's definitely

2039.109 --> 2045.799
not the same concept and yeah they might

2043.099 --> 2048.889
have lent some visual ideas from it

2045.799 --> 2050.929
probably yeah the ghost in the shell'

2048.889 --> 2053.179
the original one was very good and I

2050.929 --> 2059.0
made a movie and I think by the way that

2053.179 --> 2061.879
the actual live acted movie was very

2059.0 --> 2069.819
good as well it was amazing and I love

2061.879 --> 2069.819
the music in it so very good movie

2085.69 --> 2088.69
what

2091.46 --> 2100.45
are you saying that Jamie Brown's mother

2094.76 --> 2103.5690000000004
is on YouTube that's weird

2100.45 --> 2107.6899999999996
on the other hand my dad does have a

2103.569 --> 2109.579
youtube account too I think and it has

2107.69 --> 2111.65
zero activities and the only thing that

2109.579 --> 2113.48
he subscribed to is my channel and he

2111.65 --> 2129.23
has one comment on one of the videos and

2113.48 --> 2131.44
that's it all right okay I get it I get

2129.23 --> 2131.44
it

2162.64 --> 2192.42
okay thanks and a Dean

2202.48 --> 2212.18
let's see ah

2205.3 --> 2215.4500000000003
all right unfortunately I don't think

2212.18 --> 2220.1
marks gonna make it he can't get his

2215.45 --> 2223.0
mobile to properly login ah that's

2220.1 --> 2223.0
really sad

2223.63 --> 2228.26
I've seen this problem before and the

2226.19 --> 2238.25
only way to get it done was to actually

2228.26 --> 2241.3900000000003
know somehow the the Google name and

2238.25 --> 2244.91
then you can add it on the back panel

2241.39 --> 2246.7999999999997
but yeah for that to enable in order to

2244.91 --> 2249.1099999999997
do that you have to actually make an

2246.8 --> 2251.6200000000003
account and do it first so that's

2249.11 --> 2255.77
technically impossible at this point

2251.62 --> 2259.22
he'd have to get on a desktop computer

2255.77 --> 2262.67
station do it through there and then I'd

2259.22 --> 2264.9199999999996
have his yeah his account name and could

2262.67 --> 2266.81
potentially add him that way even if he

2264.92 --> 2271.48
was on his mobile but can do that at

2266.81 --> 2271.48
this point so yeah sorry mark

2287.66 --> 2293.14
come on you know swearing

2333.02 --> 2337.7599999999998
I'm eating this I already told you

2379.21 --> 2389.78
so is any one of you actually gonna get

2382.4 --> 2392.9300000000003
on my panel you do realize I literally

2389.78 --> 2397.73
put out the hangout link in chat several

2392.93 --> 2401.96
times and there's nobody here I'm kind

2397.73 --> 2404.77
of surprised I'd expect to be trolled or

2401.96 --> 2404.77
something

2412.59 --> 2420.3
ayyyy was that how goody yeah I should

2417.15 --> 2423.15
have known that that would happen I'm

2420.3 --> 2425.61
not controlling you and I'm not saying

2423.15 --> 2427.11
that I just said I should have expected

2425.61 --> 2432.96
that to happen that's all

2427.11 --> 2439.08
hello jazz akanda I mean how are ya

2432.96 --> 2445.4900000000002
yeah doing good well that's good and you

2439.08 --> 2450.33
late in the evening yeah no there's

2445.49 --> 2452.52
reasonably light but good solid stop boy

2450.33 --> 2459.42
and once again when I do stop and I'm

2452.52 --> 2461.7
never trolling I wasn't referencing you

2459.42 --> 2463.23
or just said like okay I put the Hangout

2461.7 --> 2466.68
and open in the path

2463.23 --> 2469.8
yeah the Hangout link in the chat and I

2466.68 --> 2472.0499999999997
did expect basically what would happen

2469.8 --> 2474.54
let's say a year ago that yeah some

2472.05 --> 2477.03
weirdo troll sock would get on there and

2474.54 --> 2479.72
start to snipe everything or something

2477.03 --> 2485.7900000000004
like that but nope

2479.72 --> 2488.04
yeah no no no I'm not saying you would I

2485.79 --> 2491.7
just said that I expected that to happen

2488.04 --> 2495.99
in general since I put out the link for

2491.7 --> 2500.49
over 40 minutes oh yeah yeah but thanks

2495.99 --> 2504.0
for joining thanks for coming oh no

2500.49 --> 2505.95
that's all good no I was just um I can't

2504.0 --> 2510.12
remember who said in the chat before

2505.95 --> 2513.2599999999998
James Mays I think he said are we

2510.12 --> 2521.6099999999997
talking about gas pressure all right

2513.26 --> 2524.88
yeah and I was just gonna talk about

2521.61 --> 2528.9
that that's how they're this fear

2524.88 --> 2530.58
doesn't disappear because it's

2528.9 --> 2533.46
atmospheric pressure it's not gas

2530.58 --> 2534.87
pressure all right yeah you're the one

2533.46 --> 2535.91
that brought that up that it was

2534.87 --> 2540.0899999999997
hilarious

2535.91 --> 2543.42
so it's atmospheric that atmospheric

2540.09 --> 2546.329
pressure you reference does the

2543.42 --> 2551.009
atmospheric pressure consist of

2546.329 --> 2553.219
gasps pressure no will every thousand

2551.009 --> 2556.0190000000002
feet above sea level

2553.219 --> 2559.7690000000002
okay so uh kind of pressure does it

2556.019 --> 2561.1989999999996
consist of its its atmospheric pressure

2559.769 --> 2568.3799999999997
barometric pressure

2561.199 --> 2569.88
yeah but the pressure on what oh I can't

2568.38 --> 2574.469
even remember it's been ten years since

2569.88 --> 2575.009
I did my exams but it's the give you a

2574.469 --> 2577.619
hint

2575.009 --> 2585.809
it starts with the G and it ends with an

2577.619 --> 2589.38
S yeah but if you want to know what I'm

2585.809 --> 2593.0690000000004
the stammered the state and atmospheric

2589.38 --> 2597.539
pressure at sea level as a thousand and

2593.069 --> 2600.329
thirteen hectopascals or in the northern

2597.539 --> 2604.4390000000003
hemisphere its twenty nine point two to

2600.329 --> 2609.119
nine on on two inches of mercury and

2604.439 --> 2612.509
every thousand feet above sea level they

2609.119 --> 2614.039
all right I only know hectopascals but

2612.509 --> 2616.92
every thousand feet above the sea level

2614.039 --> 2621.2990000000004
would it decreases by two heating

2616.92 --> 2623.7290000000003
Pascal's per thousand feet mm-hmm Nevers

2621.299 --> 2626.069
really cool the gradient we know it's a

2623.729 --> 2628.589
gradient yeah yeah a pressure gradient

2626.069 --> 2633.179
barometric pressure yeah yeah yeah so

2628.589 --> 2636.719
pressure on what what is the pressure

2633.179 --> 2638.4590000000003
about except for the region is clear

2636.719 --> 2641.009
it's the atmosphere it concerns the

2638.459 --> 2644.0989999999997
atmosphere so what is the pressure about

2641.009 --> 2646.92
what is actually pressing in the

2644.099 --> 2649.079
atmospheric pressure well it's exactly

2646.92 --> 2653.819
essentially exactly the same thing as

2649.079 --> 2658.6400000000003
the sea you know here diving is it water

2653.819 --> 2660.719
pressure no no what what is it pressure

2658.64 --> 2663.089
what is why don't you answer the

2660.719 --> 2664.529
question what is atmospheric pressure

2663.089 --> 2667.799
what does it concern

2664.529 --> 2670.199
what is the pressure how about I when

2667.799 --> 2672.209
I'm trying to explain it to you if you

2670.199 --> 2674.2490000000003
were in a but I don't need wings I don't

2672.209 --> 2678.5989999999997
need an explanation I just need the

2674.249 --> 2679.7099999999996
answer I learnt it so blatantly so can

2678.599 --> 2682.25
you answer it

2679.71 --> 2687.51
what is depression a lot of data MERS

2682.25 --> 2693.45
hmm do you know what a datum is the UT

2687.51 --> 2695.6400000000003
aim oh I know it's not the answer that I

2693.45 --> 2697.589
was looking for it's a single point on

2695.64 --> 2700.41
earth so if you're standing vertically

2697.589 --> 2703.65
and you're looking down from space right

2700.41 --> 2707.1299999999997
through your head down to your feet from

2703.65 --> 2716.599
space you see okay not from space from

2707.13 --> 2719.4900000000002
the dome because we can get there oh no

2716.599 --> 2721.9500000000003
no no that's no no you're mistaken

2719.49 --> 2723.8689999999997
that's not a datum a datum as a single

2721.95 --> 2726.4199999999996
point above the earth that you're

2723.869 --> 2728.25
standing on correct so my point again

2726.42 --> 2731.059
let me reiterate so the point that

2728.25 --> 2734.809
you're standing on are you on the level

2731.059 --> 2736.9500000000003
baseline or are you want to curve oh

2734.809 --> 2740.1600000000003
well this could go either way at this

2736.95 --> 2743.3089999999997
point I mean your opinion are you are

2740.16 --> 2745.2599999999998
you leveled or if you're an if you're on

2743.309 --> 2747.299
the point well that's why I mean it

2745.26 --> 2750.5690000000004
could go either way because you can

2747.299 --> 2755.15
still be level on a curve cuz it's one

2750.569 --> 2755.15
point on that well except either way

2759.619 --> 2772.29
anyway so you still haven't told me what

2762.599 --> 2774.569
the pressure is on well no no no I know

2772.29 --> 2776.609
I get the concept of atmospheric

2774.569 --> 2778.65
pressure I just want to know what the

2776.609 --> 2780.45
atmospheric pressure is about what is

2778.65 --> 2794.819
actually being pressed upon in

2780.45 --> 2797.79
atmospheric pressure and what type of

2794.819 --> 2806.22
mass does the atmosphere usually contain

2797.79 --> 2808.349
off that is being pressed upon but

2806.22 --> 2811.049
you're overlooking a certain specific

2808.349 --> 2813.27
element that involves the atmosphere

2811.049 --> 2823.44
above all other things

2813.27 --> 2825.57
yeah no gas gas pressure oh yeah that's

2823.44 --> 2829.7000000000003
right exactly thank you that's exactly

2825.57 --> 2833.2200000000003
what I wanted to know and yeah if

2829.7 --> 2835.02
atmospheric pressure can do all kinds of

2833.22 --> 2838.02
things but it's dealing with gas

2835.02 --> 2841.17
pressure and where gas pressure comes

2838.02 --> 2843.63
into play you start to deal with the

2841.17 --> 2847.02
second law of thermodynamics and the

2843.63 --> 2851.25
concept that gas pressure in order for

2847.02 --> 2853.14
it to exist there must be a container so

2851.25 --> 2855.75
nobody doesn't really like that's the

2853.14 --> 2858.18
problem it's just red herrings it yeah

2855.75 --> 2860.76
yeah it doesn't it does

2858.18 --> 2863.6699999999996
that's good scientists no container

2860.76 --> 2865.9500000000003
because if you think about it and you

2863.67 --> 2867.78
and we're talking about atmospheric

2865.95 --> 2870.33
pressure yeah this is why elements fly

2867.78 --> 2873.69
at 35,000 feet because the air particles

2870.33 --> 2874.83
are smaller they can fly faster through

2873.69 --> 2877.23
the air because there's less air

2874.83 --> 2878.85
particles if they're flying faster

2877.23 --> 2880.5
through the air to get the same amount

2878.85 --> 2883.35
of particles that water levels through

2880.5 --> 2888.72
the engine so at higher altitude they

2883.35 --> 2891.33
can fly faster yeah no no no no this

2888.72 --> 2893.7
goes with the same thing that is

2891.33 --> 2896.06
barometric pressure with every thousand

2893.7 --> 2899.7
feet you gain an altitude from sea level

2896.06 --> 2901.619
the atmospheric pressure drops both by

2899.7 --> 2904.83
to hit two Pascal so if you're going up

2901.619 --> 2907.7400000000002
to sixty seventy thousand feet the air

2904.83 --> 2911.5499999999997
molecules up there are so thin that a

2907.74 --> 2917.5499999999997
neo item can go extremely fast if you go

2911.55 --> 2924.0600000000004
above that and the air molecules are 80

2917.55 --> 2927.5600000000004
kilometers is typically space it's not

2924.06 --> 2931.2599999999998
so simple as that any higher altitudes

2927.56 --> 2934.23
airplanes may have less friction from

2931.26 --> 2937.05
moving through the air but they also

2934.23 --> 2940.859
have more trouble staying afloat upon

2937.05 --> 2942.84
the low gas pressure so they often need

2940.859 --> 2944.0099999999998
to go faster in order to keep themselves

2942.84 --> 2945.4500000000003
normally of

2944.01 --> 2951.2700000000004
or they'd have to be specifically

2945.45 --> 2953.91
designed to be floaters Alan you kind of

2951.27 --> 2958.2
got it but you don't now I do got it I

2953.91 --> 2962.46
got it come on you still haven't had

2958.2 --> 2965.46
they responded to the question it's

2962.46 --> 2968.85
still gas pressure all of it it's not a

2965.46 --> 2972.15
yes Rachel form it has to no ways and it

2968.85 --> 2973.98
will always form after the gas pressure

2972.15 --> 2977.13
has found its equilibrium within the

2973.98 --> 2981.3
container and then everything starts to

2977.13 --> 2984.23
move into its relative density position

2981.3 --> 2987.7200000000003
however that comes in however that is

2984.23 --> 2989.88
driven forth or whatever powers may be

2987.72 --> 2992.16
even proposed idli applying but first

2989.88 --> 2995.07
the gas pressure has to find its

2992.16 --> 2997.109
equilibrium within the container it's

2995.07 --> 2998.6090000000004
likely I when you talk about gas

2997.109 --> 3003.109
pressure in a container you know what a

2998.609 --> 3006.17
compressor is yeah a container it's a

3003.109 --> 3007.4
container that compresses the space in

3006.17 --> 3010.55
which competitors

3007.4 --> 3012.619
yeah even further exactly so every

3010.55 --> 3018.8
molecule of air within that container is

3012.619 --> 3021.38
at the same pressure right it is at 2013

3018.8 --> 3023.03
on an international standard atmospheric

3021.38 --> 3025.9100000000003
day there's a thousand and thirteen hit

3023.03 --> 3027.5600000000004
to Pascal's at sea level mm-hmm and over

3025.91 --> 3030.89
the very same point where you're

3027.56 --> 3034.34
standing on a beach on an international

3030.89 --> 3039.77
standard atmospheric day plus 13 degrees

3034.34 --> 3044.48
yeah I know you can go Owen I know about

3039.77 --> 3047.359
the gradient I know about the gradient I

3044.48 --> 3050.39
know about the gradient you told me but

3047.359 --> 3053.54
if you'd have a go sorry if you'd have a

3050.39 --> 3056.39
compressor that was fast

3053.54 --> 3058.34
not saying that that makes any damn

3056.39 --> 3060.35
sense to build such a thing but a vast

3058.34 --> 3066.17
compressor then it would be a couple of

3060.35 --> 3067.67
hundred meters across and you're gonna

3066.17 --> 3070.85
pressurize that thing and you would hold

3067.67 --> 3074.15
steady trust me especially when the

3070.85 --> 3076.7799999999997
pressure gets up really high maybe you

3074.15 --> 3078.67
could put a camera in the container we

3076.78 --> 3081.67
it's that big or some kind of pressure

3078.67 --> 3084.52
measuring device I'll tell you there be

3081.67 --> 3086.35
a gradient within that compressor

3084.52 --> 3091.06
container you know why because it's

3086.35 --> 3095.13
largely no there's no oh yeah yeah there

3091.06 --> 3100.18
is gonna be a gradient within the large

3095.13 --> 3110.29
compressor that actually happens in for

3100.18 --> 3113.2
example voids in ships yeah I mean it

3110.29 --> 3117.2799999999997
happens with liquids as well I think I

3113.2 --> 3121.24
think I think the problem here or win is

3117.28 --> 3123.55
that you're using and you're basically

3121.24 --> 3125.2
saying that every single pressurized

3123.55 --> 3128.6800000000003
container that I've seen with my own

3125.2 --> 3130.1499999999996
eyes and that I've read about is small

3128.68 --> 3133.66
and on earth

3130.15 --> 3136.9900000000002
so therefore the gigantic atmosphere

3133.66 --> 3141.8199999999997
above us must also be containerized but

3136.99 --> 3145.39
that's just that's exactly no you know

3141.82 --> 3149.11
that's a nice trick you nice trick no no

3145.39 --> 3151.3599999999997
I'm I don't use that example to assume

3149.11 --> 3155.4900000000002
that we must be in a container what I

3151.36 --> 3158.8
use is the antecedent of gas pressure I

3155.49 --> 3162.91
just go to the natural laws to actual

3158.8 --> 3166.6000000000004
official physics gas pressure requires a

3162.91 --> 3176.1099999999997
container can be no gas pressure without

3166.6 --> 3178.42
a container it's what it's the

3176.11 --> 3183.2200000000003
antiquated requires the container is the

3178.42 --> 3184.36
second law the second law is not it

3183.22 --> 3186.7599999999998
doesn't is not included with our

3184.36 --> 3189.1
atmosphere because we have an open

3186.76 --> 3190.9300000000003
system as far as energy is concerned no

3189.1 --> 3192.7
that's what you don't see can leave the

3190.93 --> 3195.7599999999998
planet and income on snow that's what

3192.7 --> 3198.49
you assume you assume this must be an

3195.76 --> 3202.3300000000004
open container because it must be open

3198.49 --> 3203.8599999999997
to you but you have no real or way but

3202.33 --> 3205.72
if you're talking about physical that's

3203.86 --> 3209.56
what we say when you leave us in the ice

3205.72 --> 3214.08
water what Arwen

3209.56 --> 3218.71
plants need sunlight right yeah right

3214.08 --> 3223.63
okay so that is solar energy coming into

3218.71 --> 3226.9
our system to fuel plants correct right

3223.63 --> 3230.1600000000003
it's it's de lion coming into the realm

3226.9 --> 3233.85
somehow and being absorbed by by

3230.16 --> 3237.25
physical matter yes and and the and the

3233.85 --> 3238.9
general I wouldn't say it's extremely

3237.25 --> 3240.73
general but please you generalized

3238.9 --> 3246.9300000000003
consensus among flat-earthers is that

3240.73 --> 3250.9900000000002
Sun outside of I don't care I don't get

3246.93 --> 3256.0299999999997
about consensus be it globe or don't

3250.99 --> 3261.25
come senses be it let earth or comes you

3256.03 --> 3263.59
believe the Sun do you believe I don't

3261.25 --> 3265.78
believe the Sun is anywhere I don't

3263.59 --> 3269.44
believe the Sun as a thing I believe

3265.78 --> 3274.0600000000004
it's an apparition you okay do do you

3269.44 --> 3278.02
think it's actually I think the daylight

3274.06 --> 3281.5
comes into being in the atmosphere

3278.02 --> 3282.25
definitely yes well I will I will help

3281.5 --> 3286.15
you out

3282.25 --> 3288.37
only thanks the Sun is a solar body that

3286.15 --> 3290.6800000000003
emits that yeah that's not happening

3288.37 --> 3292.8399999999997
that's not helping at all that's not

3290.68 --> 3297.8199999999997
helping at all that's just making up a

3292.84 --> 3300.28
story all right so that's outside of the

3297.82 --> 3302.23
atmosphere therefore it is an open

3300.28 --> 3309.25
system which was mentioned just a couple

3302.23 --> 3312.52
minutes ago and there okay it's not so

3309.25 --> 3315.4
that it doesn't have to apply it is that

3312.52 --> 3322.06
it always applies that's why it's a law

3315.4 --> 3327.61
no it does only the exceptions you

3322.06 --> 3331.87
imagine that an actual physical reality

3327.61 --> 3334.1800000000003
it's not it's always there I'm not

3331.87 --> 3335.74
getting angry I'm getting very direct

3334.18 --> 3338.8199999999997
because you're making you're starting to

3335.74 --> 3343.6
spin a [ __ ] stories here

3338.82 --> 3345.4300000000003
yeah you are alright yeah you're you're

3343.6 --> 3347.47
saying oh look it's a ball it's outside

3345.43 --> 3350.56
of the atmosphere and because that is

3347.47 --> 3352.54
the truth therefore the earth must be an

3350.56 --> 3354.31
open system so there is an exception to

3352.54 --> 3359.16
the second law of thermodynamics I've

3354.31 --> 3363.79
never heard such a such a wide standing

3359.16 --> 3365.68
[ __ ] story listen to me it's not an

3363.79 --> 3367.5099999999998
exception to the second law of

3365.68 --> 3370.66
thermodynamics it's just that it does

3367.51 --> 3375.5200000000004
not apply to earth if you want to

3370.66 --> 3377.85
consider it that is exactly what you

3375.52 --> 3380.44
just denied that it is you just

3377.85 --> 3385.54
literally flip-flopped in a single

3380.44 --> 3391.869
sentence there you flip-flopped in your

3385.54 --> 3394.66
own Santa Clause system you're nuts you

3391.869 --> 3398.3500000000004
said it's not a exception it's just that

3394.66 --> 3401.35
it's the exception that's what you said

3398.35 --> 3410.35
look if you want you can listen back to

3401.35 --> 3412.48
what you said I didn't Arwen no you're

3410.35 --> 3415.21
saying that but still you breathe gas

3412.48 --> 3418.03
pressure so that's kind of a foolish

3415.21 --> 3419.53
foolish assumption do you have it in

3418.03 --> 3421.09
front of you Arwen you said you you

3419.53 --> 3423.9700000000003
really appreciate the second month on my

3421.09 --> 3427.71
Amex you have the actual description in

3423.97 --> 3430.66
front of you no okay I do yes good so

3427.71 --> 3433.66
I'm gonna focus on one word present it

3430.66 --> 3439.6
yeah present it and I look at your

3433.66 --> 3441.1
scooter my car just so story that you've

3439.6 --> 3442.81
got from somewhere well I mean everyone

3441.1 --> 3446.7999999999997
in here knows that it's about the

3442.81 --> 3449.7599999999998
entropy in an isolated system those are

3446.8 --> 3451.9900000000002
very important terms isolated system

3449.76 --> 3455.4700000000003
that means that it's not being affected

3451.99 --> 3459.0699999999997
by an outside an outside the stimulus

3455.47 --> 3461.02
and it's not you know losing stuff the

3459.07 --> 3462.6400000000003
outside its isolate have been that's

3461.02 --> 3464.2599999999998
let's keep it as isolated that's what

3462.64 --> 3466.66
we're trying to find out well no but

3464.26 --> 3469.9300000000003
that's what that describes that isolates

3466.66 --> 3471.97
gas pressure that's the thing is the

3469.93 --> 3476.98
earth is not an isolated system the

3471.97 --> 3479.02
heat from the Sun comes and it goes yeah

3476.98 --> 3481.69
but you're assuming it that it's coming

3479.02 --> 3485.53
from the outside you have no confirmable

3481.69 --> 3494.38
proof of that it comes in from the

3485.53 --> 3497.6800000000003
outside and it also bounces back as well

3494.38 --> 3501.4500000000003
it does definitely go up and down in the

3497.68 --> 3503.68
atmosphere I'll give you that

3501.45 --> 3505.1499999999996
but that's not proof that it's coming

3503.68 --> 3506.5899999999997
from outside of it

3505.15 --> 3509.619
you don't even have proof that there is

3506.59 --> 3512.88
an outside of the atmosphere there's

3509.619 --> 3515.9500000000003
there's so much proof it's ridiculous so

3512.88 --> 3518.71
presuppositional all NASA all [ __ ]

3515.95 --> 3522.3689999999997
all based on the gradient and what they

3518.71 --> 3526.17
told you is further up beyond the known

3522.369 --> 3528.34
gradient why do you want to bring that

3526.17 --> 3530.38
because that's what you're leading on

3528.34 --> 3533.5
that's what everybody's leaning on that

3530.38 --> 3538.63
has your religion religion of

3533.5 --> 3541.27
presupposition I know no I know you

3538.63 --> 3543.4300000000003
don't you don't have to call them up you

3541.27 --> 3546.67
just follow their writing during your

3543.43 --> 3548.9199999999996
life and as it is taught to you from the

3546.67 --> 3556.48
other priests so it's just normal it's

3548.92 --> 3558.25
just a normal thing everybody does about

3556.48 --> 3566.14
physics or chemistry or anything like

3558.25 --> 3570.93
that that has a let's say really

3566.14 --> 3575.2
so I I'll ask you then okay

3570.93 --> 3578.3799999999997
decide the sources of those books and

3575.2 --> 3579.97
I'll bet you I'll bet your money not a

3578.38 --> 3583.15
lot of it because I don't have a lot to

3579.97 --> 3587.02
bet I'll bet you there's gonna be NASA

3583.15 --> 3590.08
in every single one of these books not

3587.02 --> 3593.65
not all over it NASA NASA NASA no but it

3590.08 --> 3595.99
will be in there guarantee you think you

3593.65 --> 3603.14
you think it's gonna say NASA in the

3595.99 --> 3605.5389999999998
citations of yeah or people from NASA

3603.14 --> 3608.089
or people and they will be advertised

3605.539 --> 3611.059
like oh this guy is an astronaut yeah so

3608.089 --> 3615.98
he's going to be from NASA so astronauts

3611.059 --> 3619.549
now write science yet they do get

3615.98 --> 3623.9
involved with this stuff brother yeah

3619.549 --> 3626.779
Arwen are you it's they're very popular

3623.9 --> 3636.619
to psych in really looks about science

3626.779 --> 3638.809
and everything so reading is not my

3636.619 --> 3643.069
preferred method of study that's true

3638.809 --> 3645.289
but I do have read books I didn't have

3643.069 --> 3648.17
to go through school did read books in

3645.289 --> 3650.869
that sense and I do glanced through

3648.17 --> 3654.259
things or sometimes I do actually read

3650.869 --> 3656.7490000000003
it when it's just when I'm just totally

3654.259 --> 3659.9
yeah up for it and just go through it

3656.749 --> 3661.7
bang but that doesn't happen a lot I'm

3659.9 --> 3665.6800000000003
not a guy that are we looking forward to

3661.7 --> 3668.359
just reading giant giant books for study

3665.68 --> 3671.299
michael Marwood my question to you is

3668.359 --> 3672.67
that how old were you or what it was at

3671.299 --> 3681.71
the very beginning when you first

3672.67 --> 3686.2000000000003
realized it was a globe me yeah I don't

3681.71 --> 3689.059
know when somebody asked me about it I

3686.2 --> 3691.5789999999997
guess and then the first thing I would

3689.059 --> 3692.329
refer to is what would stick in my mind

3691.579 --> 3696.009
the most

3692.329 --> 3700.099
and that's probably certain really

3696.009 --> 3701.47
inspiring cartoons from the 90s and the

3700.099 --> 3709.009
80s

3701.47 --> 3718.1899999999996
how old were you what then between six

3709.009 --> 3720.619
and 12 I think all right so that's when

3718.19 --> 3722.599
you realize that the actual imprint of

3720.619 --> 3728.15
the actual globo's around six or seven

3722.599 --> 3730.2490000000003
well buddy the first time I I considered

3728.15 --> 3732.9990000000003
it to be anything more than an

3730.249 --> 3732.999
experience

3733.49 --> 3736.6099999999997
hey hello peanuts Clark thanks for

3735.65 --> 3742.19
joining

3736.61 --> 3743.42
yo can you hear me you got one on me

3742.19 --> 3747.35
then because I don't

3743.42 --> 3749.21
I cannot remember at all the first time

3747.35 --> 3752.15
I've heard anything about the first

3749.21 --> 3754.84
being a globe kid I think it's just

3752.15 --> 3758.1800000000003
something that we absorb very slowly

3754.84 --> 3760.4300000000003
yeah we don't necessarily take it so

3758.18 --> 3764.75
seriously as your average flat earthers

3760.43 --> 3769.64
well I did I was a I was a very

3764.75 --> 3771.98
fanatical space science kid very

3769.64 --> 3774.0499999999997
fanatical I loved it I was obsessed with

3771.98 --> 3777.28
it I wanted to make space stations it

3774.05 --> 3784.3
kept on coming back even into my 20s so

3777.28 --> 3787.07
yeah I was that guy for me I think you

3784.3 --> 3792.11
I'm sorry let me just I'll just finish

3787.07 --> 3794.0
up for my opinion for myself my my first

3792.11 --> 3795.8900000000003
hundred far is the introduction of the

3794.0 --> 3798.71
globe which I believe was Star Wars my

3795.89 --> 3800.54
dad took me to the movie theater and

3798.71 --> 3803.17
that was that naturally that was the

3800.54 --> 3805.46
very beginning you know and actually

3803.17 --> 3808.2200000000003
explained it actually showed me about

3805.46 --> 3810.62
the cosmology and much the shape of the

3808.22 --> 3812.6899999999996
earth so there was a lot of things that

3810.62 --> 3814.0099999999998
actually built upon that you know at the

3812.69 --> 3822.83
very beginning when I was when I was

3814.01 --> 3824.6600000000003
actually a globe er yeah I can I can

3822.83 --> 3826.67
understand from a flat earthers point of

3824.66 --> 3829.31
view they may think that it's some sort

3826.67 --> 3830.81
of insidious thing that creeps into

3829.31 --> 3833.21
someone's mind they don't think about it

3830.81 --> 3835.5499999999997
very seriously and then before you know

3833.21 --> 3837.77
it they're they're thinking or they're

3835.55 --> 3840.29
taking a position on the shape of the

3837.77 --> 3845.24
earth that they really never can

3840.29 --> 3848.81
consider but they just accept by Yod but

3845.24 --> 3850.7299999999996
i mean you know most of the buzz of the

3848.81 --> 3853.93
people on here that do believe in globe

3850.73 --> 3856.55
and like to frequent the latter venues

3853.93 --> 3860.0899999999997
they have actually researched this quite

3856.55 --> 3861.11
a bit they know they know how to make

3860.09 --> 3864.23
arguments against

3861.11 --> 3867.6200000000003
so on so yeah I mean I think III would

3864.23 --> 3869.09
sort of agree that you know if you if

3867.62 --> 3870.92
you go to your average person out there

3869.09 --> 3873.17
on the on the street and you ask them do

3870.92 --> 3874.67
you think the earth is flat around that

3873.17 --> 3878.48
is probably something that they've never

3874.67 --> 3881.4500000000003
thought of fire I've never considered

3878.48 --> 3884.87
even you know so you'll rock the world

3881.45 --> 3886.3399999999997
for introducing it yeah for most for

3884.87 --> 3888.0099999999998
most people they don't even really think

3886.34 --> 3891.23
about it too

3888.01 --> 3895.82
critically because they don't really

3891.23 --> 3897.59
need to I mean I'm about to about to

3895.82 --> 3899.7200000000003
walk into work I just wanted to pose one

3897.59 --> 3903.8500000000004
question I somebody that's a globe

3899.72 --> 3905.06
believer kind of explain it is that okay

3903.85 --> 3910.61
okay

3905.06 --> 3914.27
okay so basically the idea of the vacuum

3910.61 --> 3915.83
chamber and dropping me bowling ball and

3914.27 --> 3919.19
or feather

3915.83 --> 3922.58
whichever one so you know creating a

3919.19 --> 3924.08
vacuum dropping these objects and they

3922.58 --> 3927.56
fall in the same place

3924.08 --> 3931.73
does that not provide evidence that the

3927.56 --> 3935.09
earth is not movie because shouldn't it

3931.73 --> 3938.45
drift because Glover's say that you

3935.09 --> 3940.9700000000003
can't feel the earth spin because you're

3938.45 --> 3943.46
in the atmosphere so when you put it in

3940.97 --> 3945.5
a vacuum chamber you're eliminating the

3943.46 --> 3949.16
atmosphere and you're dropping in the

3945.5 --> 3950.93
objects and they don't drift doesn't

3949.16 --> 3952.18
that provide evidence that the earth is

3950.93 --> 3955.46
not moving

3952.18 --> 3957.5
no no because the the the bowling ball

3955.46 --> 3962.87
and the feather have also been dropped

3957.5 --> 3965.36
from a frame of rotation the the the on

3962.87 --> 3967.58
a rotating earth the tank that the ball

3965.36 --> 3969.56
is being dropped in is also rotating on

3967.58 --> 3972.11
the surface of the earth and the ball

3969.56 --> 3977.84
was also dropped from a rotational

3972.11 --> 3982.8700000000003
motion so no you wouldn't really expect

3977.84 --> 3982.8700000000003
that hello Merle thanks for joining me

3986.2 --> 4001.3399999999997
Merle yeah sorry sorry swear

3993.87 --> 4004.73
girl and okj out jazz you've already got

4001.34 --> 4006.56
two here I'll consider then you've also

4004.73 --> 4008.78
gotta consider the sheer size of the

4006.56 --> 4011.35
earth even though it's moving at about a

4008.78 --> 4015.23
thousand miles per hour at the equator

4011.35 --> 4017.42
the sheer size of the earth pretty much

4015.23 --> 4021.02
makes it so that it's only rotating once

4017.42 --> 4025.81
every 24 hours that's not that's not a

4021.02 --> 4029.09
whole lot of centrifugal force or

4025.81 --> 4032.24
centripetal force either because of the

4029.09 --> 4034.4300000000003
giant radius of the earth so that's not

4032.24 --> 4038.45
really going to nudge it very very much

4034.43 --> 4041.5699999999997
the the the thing is if you do have a

4038.45 --> 4043.1
large tank and you've got a sorry if

4041.57 --> 4045.19
it's up surf there's a lot of noise I'm

4043.1 --> 4050.2999999999997
cleaning out a garage right now but oh

4045.19 --> 4051.86
good supposing supposing you do have a

4050.3 --> 4056.9900000000002
large tank that's a vacuum and you drop

4051.86 --> 4061.42
a bowling ball and a feather in it it is

4056.99 --> 4067.1299999999997
it is going to very very very slightly

4061.42 --> 4072.85
move trying to think of the name of that

4067.13 --> 4072.85
motion most affect something like that

4073.75 --> 4081.53
and yeah so there's there's a there's a

4078.23 --> 4084.5
very very slight amount of drift due to

4081.53 --> 4087.98
the fact that the earth is rotating once

4084.5 --> 4089.99
every 24 hours but it's very very small

4087.98 --> 4092.66
you're not even going to notice it if

4089.99 --> 4094.8199999999997
you if you do something as simple as or

4092.66 --> 4097.67
something as small as dropping a bowling

4094.82 --> 4100.339
ball in a vacuum tank that's let's say

4097.67 --> 4103.91
20 feet high it's not going to happen

4100.339 --> 4107.57
right well I have an opinion with

4103.91 --> 4110.93
peanuts is some density density well we

4107.57 --> 4112.429999999999
call it the space vacuum and and there's

4110.93 --> 4116.570000000001
a lot of clues that we need to look at

4112.43 --> 4118.9400000000005
because for one instance observably if

4116.57 --> 4122.03
we are trying to actually create a space

4118.94 --> 4126.44
vacuum those two objects should not fall

4122.03 --> 4127.679999999999
and it should float so that means there

4126.44 --> 4129.48
is a still a certain

4127.68 --> 4131.820000000001
action that's going down that's one

4129.48 --> 4133.709999999999
method the only way to isolate it and

4131.82 --> 4135.96
really know what this base vacuum or

4133.71 --> 4138.45
that chamber is working yeah would have

4135.96 --> 4141.21
to be in space for that space change you

4138.45 --> 4143.19
know for those objects to work I'm you

4141.21 --> 4145.41
described can you describe what you met

4143.19 --> 4148.7699999999995
my bags I'm that confused me I think you

4145.41 --> 4151.62
should float that's well it's

4148.77 --> 4153.4800000000005
interesting me too yeah so what I mean

4151.62 --> 4155.49
what's the purpose of having a vacuum

4153.48 --> 4160.41
chamber I mean are we trying to actually

4155.49 --> 4164.19
observe it as a space well nothing in

4160.41 --> 4166.3099999999995
space is floating by a single thing so

4164.19 --> 4168.54
that it's dropping or it's attracting

4166.31 --> 4171.27
yeah they're all they're all orbiting if

4168.54 --> 4173.37
it's if it's it's either free-falling or

4171.27 --> 4176.55
it's an orbit but nothing is nothing in

4173.37 --> 4178.86
space anywhere concluding yeah I mean

4176.55 --> 4181.59
things things in space are always in

4178.86 --> 4184.17
motion relative to something else and

4181.59 --> 4188.76
that's that's really all motion is hold

4184.17 --> 4191.22
on oh that's not true yeah yeah but no

4188.76 --> 4193.4400000000005
you can't assume that that is always in

4191.22 --> 4196.59
some kind of orbit just because

4193.44 --> 4198.66
everything else out there technically

4196.59 --> 4201.81
should be moving doesn't mean that it is

4198.66 --> 4206.04
automatically orbiting something yeah

4201.81 --> 4208.02
but all of its relative supposedly out

4206.04 --> 4209.79
there in outer space yeah I mean I mean

4208.02 --> 4211.56
you're you're you are kind of right

4209.79 --> 4214.94
there and that it's it's kind of strange

4211.56 --> 4218.070000000001
to say that something is orbiting but

4214.94 --> 4219.33
something is always moving relative to

4218.07 --> 4221.58
something else and that's yeah but

4219.33 --> 4224.67
that's not orbiting orbiting is just a

4221.58 --> 4229.14
giraffe way guided by supposed to

4224.67 --> 4231.27
gravity attraction balance yeah that's

4229.14 --> 4233.46
why to orbit something you need to be

4231.27 --> 4239.1900000000005
high and there has to be a very high

4233.46 --> 4241.89
horizontal velocity but to keep falling

4239.19 --> 4245.099999999999
towards but stay the same distance away

4241.89 --> 4248.43
from it's it's it's basically you need

4245.1 --> 4250.8
ten tangential motion to the center of

4248.43 --> 4256.89
gravity of wherever you're whatever you

4250.8 --> 4259.14
are orbiting so in my opinion what we're

4256.89 --> 4261.689
trying to measure or we're trying to

4259.14 --> 4264.959000000001
observe I don't think that

4261.689 --> 4267.51
this type of sugar would be a good

4264.959 --> 4269.51
observation whether if it's if we're not

4267.51 --> 4274.439
narrative we're not getting a clear

4269.51 --> 4276.4490000000005
alright well I mean the use of I mean

4274.439 --> 4278.6990000000005
that the the use of dropping a bowling

4276.449 --> 4281.428999999999
ball and a feather in a vacuum chamber

4278.699 --> 4284.728999999999
here on earth is to demonstrate gravity

4281.429 --> 4288.079
the nine point eight two seconds or I'm

4284.729 --> 4290.669
sorry nine point eight two m/s

4288.079 --> 4293.099
acceleration that's that's really what

4290.669 --> 4297.059
that was for it was to demonstrate that

4293.099 --> 4299.76
gravity has and it doesn't very right

4297.059 --> 4302.4890000000005
and it was it will use it was used to

4299.76 --> 4304.079000000001
demonstrate gravity's equal effect on

4302.489 --> 4307.11
both of those masses both the feather

4304.079 --> 4310.829
and the bowling ball what you proposed a

4307.11 --> 4313.409
minute ago was to get a vacuum out in

4310.829 --> 4315.03
space and see how things flow I mean I'm

4313.409 --> 4317.369
not I'm not even sure what you were

4315.03 --> 4319.409
meaning yeah I know I mean it's

4317.369 --> 4322.679
unfortunate that it's these types of

4319.409 --> 4324.179
labels that we're here to talk about but

4322.679 --> 4327.36
I'm trying to bring it down to a

4324.179 --> 4329.189
baseline where you have a where they

4327.36 --> 4331.499
tell us it's the sucking force or VAT

4329.189 --> 4333.4490000000005
your vacuum is sucking so I don't know

4331.499 --> 4338.51
what I can tell you what vacuum is up

4333.449 --> 4338.509999999999
there that I'm not sucking let's see

4338.84 --> 4350.4890000000005
okay okay we give we give a some vacuums

4346.619 --> 4353.098999999999
do suck like vacuum cleaners suck know

4350.489 --> 4355.228999999999
what what's happening what's happening

4353.099 --> 4356.88
is the high-pressure whatever that's

4355.229 --> 4358.38
coming from like an in a cocaine you

4356.88 --> 4360.869
have a cocaine it's like yeah you know

4358.38 --> 4365.939
50 psi what's happening is the pressure

4360.869 --> 4368.57
is leaving the can that's not vacuum

4365.939 --> 4373.229
cleaner suck so they work the same way

4368.57 --> 4377.999
hold on yeah James is right technically

4373.229 --> 4381.599
a vacuum cleaner pushes out the air and

4377.999 --> 4385.86
then the rest of the surrounding gas

4381.599 --> 4389.4890000000005
will immediately try to fill the the gas

4385.86 --> 4392.039
pressure differential locally and find a

4389.489 --> 4395.0199999999995
new equilibrium so it moves it displaces

4392.039 --> 4399.219999999999
itself directly very quickly and as

4395.02 --> 4401.860000000001
as quick as require one notices you need

4399.22 --> 4405.25
to add power to that system to make that

4401.86 --> 4407.5
displacement for the for the air to

4405.25 --> 4411.58
basically get sucked into that vacuum

4407.5 --> 4414.16
again so I mean you still have to add

4411.58 --> 4418.6
power to that system for the second

4414.16 --> 4421.18
power generally yes generally yes but

4418.6 --> 4424.660000000001
there are interesting mechanisms like

4421.18 --> 4426.450000000001
for example you can let I don't know

4424.66 --> 4430.389999999999
maybe it's not exactly right but

4426.45 --> 4434.74
comparison to having a a water hose and

4430.39 --> 4438.37
you can yeah let water go through that

4434.74 --> 4440.83
and if it has some longer side on one

4438.37 --> 4443.83
side it will actually pull the water all

4440.83 --> 4449.49
the way out of the container from which

4443.83 --> 4449.49
it is drawn the water and just let the

4451.68 --> 4460.81
okay so that that doesn't actually

4455.32 --> 4463.509999999999
require any external force that's the

4460.81 --> 4467.17
thing it's just the natural inherent

4463.51 --> 4470.59
abilities allow it to do that so all

4467.17 --> 4472.21
right so I went real quick we were

4470.59 --> 4474.46
talking about the atmosphere before it

4472.21 --> 4508.24
let's say the top of the atmosphere the

4474.46 --> 4517.42
strata to your mic yeah it was trying to

4508.24 --> 4522.7
make a point about the atmosphere before

4517.42 --> 4526.66
let's say sea level 2,000 feet a hundred

4522.7 --> 4528.579
thousand feets if we go every thousand

4526.66 --> 4531.489
feet we go up it

4528.579 --> 4534.25
it just to make it all equal let's say

4531.489 --> 4541.058999999999
at sea level we have a hundred thousand

4534.25 --> 4543.699
hit dude stop chewing here Mike John

4541.059 --> 4546.219
every thousand feet we lose a hundred

4543.699 --> 4549.428999999999
hit so when we get to a hundred thousand

4546.219 --> 4552.429
feet we've got no heat that's where

4549.429 --> 4556.27
spaces can you try to knocked walk

4552.429 --> 4560.02
around and just talk in the mic steadily

4556.27 --> 4563.9490000000005
without moving or touching it I've got

4560.02 --> 4570.52
some real real weird Mike thing I'm

4563.949 --> 4574.388999999999
holding it sometimes like this is broken

4570.52 --> 4575.92
off so I'm sorry yeah you were talking

4574.389 --> 4579.159000000001
about the gradients and that there's

4575.92 --> 4582.57
different levels of you're sure on

4579.159 --> 4586.69
different heights yeah I was just

4582.57 --> 4589.09
it goes from sea level it gets less and

4586.69 --> 4593.28
less and less and less and less up to a

4589.09 --> 4598.599
certain height where the atmosphere is

4593.28 --> 4601.989
negligible rockets spices negligible you

4598.599 --> 4605.59
say I don't think that's gonna be at and

4601.989 --> 4607.808999999999
a hundred thousand feet no I was just

4605.59 --> 4611.05
using that as an example yeah well yeah

4607.809 --> 4613.03
well then you assume assume beyond that

4611.05 --> 4615.88
example and start to say it's gonna be

4613.03 --> 4619.65
negligible I don't think so don't think

4615.88 --> 4622.0
there's any measured record or add it is

4619.65 --> 4623.739
negligible in the sense that if you go

4622.0 --> 4631.949
up to a hundred thousand feet you're

4623.739 --> 4631.949
gonna die in about two seconds right

4633.75 --> 4639.79
necklace.if is a depressurization they

4636.909 --> 4642.82
say you know the oxygen must come down

4639.79 --> 4644.349
and the briefing they say put yours on

4642.82 --> 4646.75
first before you put your kids on

4644.349 --> 4649.27
otherwise if you don't if you put your

4646.75 --> 4653.02
kids on first your guy and you kids'll

4649.27 --> 4655.21
die let's have a look at you right okay

4653.02 --> 4657.070000000001
yeah well humans were meant to function

4655.21 --> 4659.2300000000005
normally under a certain level of

4657.07 --> 4662.41
pressure so we're not disputing the

4659.23 --> 4665.679999999999
organic consequences just

4662.41 --> 4668.08
it is negligible as in there is actually

4665.68 --> 4671.02
almost nothing or insignificant and I

4668.08 --> 4672.43
highly dispute that claim I don't think

4671.02 --> 4675.610000000001
so I think there is a pressure gradient

4672.43 --> 4677.83
I think that the grading has a specific

4675.61 --> 4679.54
pattern to it which naturally happens

4677.83 --> 4684.19
with almost everything like this and

4679.54 --> 4686.74
that is us that the pressure has a 1/2

4684.19 --> 4690.19
pressure distance effect so the higher

4686.74 --> 4694.29
up you go the slower over the distance

4690.19 --> 4697.839999999999
the halving of the pressure will go so

4694.29 --> 4700.99
at a certain height there will be a

4697.84 --> 4702.9400000000005
large swath with regularly the cell the

4700.99 --> 4705.099999999999
same level of pressure even though very

4702.94 --> 4708.7
low on the earth the pressure gradient

4705.1 --> 4712.030000000001
will be very measurably different at

4708.7 --> 4713.83
relatively small distances so that is a

4712.03 --> 4715.84
claim I make about the great nature of

4713.83 --> 4718.65
the gradient and I don't think there's

4715.84 --> 4721.42
any point where there supposedly any

4718.65 --> 4731.95
insignificant air pressure absolutely

4721.42 --> 4739.96
not not even not even close to a vacuum

4731.95 --> 4742.12
not really but the balloon I'm talking

4739.96 --> 4745.12
about significance within the spectrum

4742.12 --> 4747.37
of gas pressure from the maximum

4745.12 --> 4749.23
possible pressure to zero which is

4747.37 --> 4751.66
perfect vacuum not talking about

4749.23 --> 4754.33
relations to physical matter to that

4751.66 --> 4756.61
type of pressure because every physical

4754.33 --> 4758.79
matter has a wide range of responses

4756.61 --> 4761.32
even to slight lowering of pressure so

4758.79 --> 4763.48
we're not talking about the significance

4761.32 --> 4766.12
of its interaction with other matter

4763.48 --> 4768.48
just talking about the vacuum versus

4766.12 --> 4770.95
maximum pressure gradient in that sense

4768.48 --> 4773.98
the gradient pressure created the

4770.95 --> 4775.75
atmosphere never gets insecure when

4773.98 --> 4779.95
winds you be quiet

4775.75 --> 4784.87
I went the top of Mount Everest twenty

4779.95 --> 4789.4
nine and a half thousand feet yeah and I

4784.87 --> 4791.44
don't know where you guys are from water

4789.4 --> 4795.129999999999
blows at sea level was at a hundred

4791.44 --> 4796.66
degrees Celsius at 29,000 feet water

4795.13 --> 4800.11
boils at sixty degree

4796.66 --> 4802.51
yeah as I said it's just slightly

4800.11 --> 4805.66
fresher differentials in the atmosphere

4802.51 --> 4809.77
can have a vast influence that how

4805.66 --> 4814.09
matter responds that doesn't address

4809.77 --> 4820.660000000001
long but that's why I want to ask

4814.09 --> 4824.74
darling something must be something whoa

4820.66 --> 4832.42
look I wanna I wanna ask a hoenn about

4824.74 --> 4834.429999999999
wizards and magic sake nah come on okay

4832.42 --> 4837.9
we're talking about an American issue

4834.43 --> 4844.47
here not about lovers and spin-doctors

4837.9 --> 4844.469999999999
I'm not gonna knock wizards or no heed

4850.08 --> 4859.48
um III didn't have you said Alan that

4854.89 --> 4861.39
you're a wizard yeah said a lot of

4859.48 --> 4869.65
things I said Ivan I'm an elf

4861.39 --> 4871.990000000001
all right there's a lot of yep I think I

4869.65 --> 4873.599999999999
think slip called him a snake oh yeah

4871.99 --> 4877.66
snake in the grass

4873.6 --> 4878.950000000001
really yeah very month said he said

4877.66 --> 4882.16
Harlan was dark

4878.95 --> 4885.37
oh all embrace the dark that's what he

4882.16 --> 4892.3
said yeah I'm not feeling that a

4885.37 --> 4895.84
darkness coming I haven't had a chance

4892.3 --> 4898.42
to talk to you for a long time but I

4895.84 --> 4899.59
mean one time you came on Dells and I

4898.42 --> 4903.4
was there but we didn't really get to

4899.59 --> 4908.77
talk but I just want you to know as a

4903.4 --> 4911.889999999999
human being that when you really let out

4908.77 --> 4916.06
your feelings that had a profound effect

4911.89 --> 4920.26
on me and what that did for me was it

4916.06 --> 4925.17
gave me a signal that we could speak our

4920.26 --> 4928.75
mind yes and there is no consequences

4925.17 --> 4930.04
all that happens is the community will

4928.75 --> 4934.87
judge us

4930.04 --> 4938.46
and the chat box will say things and if

4934.87 --> 4941.62
you can withstand that you'll be okay

4938.46 --> 4946.51
but I just want you to know again as a

4941.62 --> 4950.38
human I really appreciate you and and I

4946.51 --> 4956.62
see you your own person and it's not

4950.38 --> 4960.22
easy sometimes growing into this maybe

4956.62 --> 4964.24
it's up grade or an updated version of

4960.22 --> 4966.01
ourselves but I just that that's kind of

4964.24 --> 4968.86
why I'm interested because I didn't know

4966.01 --> 4970.51
that you talked about magic and wizards

4968.86 --> 4973.54
and things like that and know everybody

4970.51 --> 4976.99
does but I have recently for my own

4973.54 --> 4979.75
reasons and so I just you know gave me a

4976.99 --> 4981.4
link today and so there's a

4979.75 --> 4984.04
synchronicity there and and I'm not

4981.4 --> 4986.049999999999
setting you up I'm I just want you to

4984.04 --> 4988.78
know like this isn't I'm not trolling

4986.05 --> 4990.49
you I just sort of wanted to open up

4988.78 --> 4992.8
that Kenny you don't have to talk about

4990.49 --> 4996.58
it it's fine but just I mean I'm

4992.8 --> 4999.37
genuinely intrigued all right well maybe

4996.58 --> 5002.28
this is not the time for it but sure

4999.37 --> 5004.47
yeah no they have had a lot of weird

5002.28 --> 5006.45
experiences and of course the dark world

5004.47 --> 5009.780000000001
experience including the one lasting 80

5006.45 --> 5012.139999999999
years noise in physical actual one

5009.78 --> 5015.2699999999995
minute of time that kind of [ __ ]

5012.14 --> 5018.6
so yeah I've seen a lot of weird [ __ ]

5015.27 --> 5023.55
and had extra planar experiences with

5018.6 --> 5027.990000000001
non-human entities and [ __ ] yeah cool

5023.55 --> 5031.35
wizards and I literally fronted with

5027.99 --> 5035.45
actual war logs and [ __ ] there was um

5031.35 --> 5038.64
that was really do you guys mind if I

5035.45 --> 5044.66
jump in and just do a quick monologue

5038.64 --> 5048.17
for about 45 seconds yes go ahead just

5044.66 --> 5054.32
hi you guys welcome back to dr. Phil

5048.17 --> 5054.32
we're god we've got arwen and Merle

5054.8 --> 5060.17
what's the payoff holy [ __ ] oh you are

5058.02 --> 5063.63
dr. Phil motivation

5060.17 --> 5064.06
what's your motivation dr. Phil is this

5063.63 --> 5066.22
what you

5064.06 --> 5072.240000000001
do in your downtime is your career

5066.22 --> 5072.240000000001
getting that depressed that depressing

5080.22 --> 5084.67
you know what like you know you know

5082.51 --> 5088.4800000000005
like every every episode of dr. Phil

5084.67 --> 5091.12
basically followed a certain format and

5088.48 --> 5094.03
it's it goes I want you to welcome our

5091.12 --> 5096.5199999999995
guest this person does really stupid

5094.03 --> 5098.98
crap that's really wrong and moral stuff

5096.52 --> 5101.530000000001
and here I'm gonna bring out the person

5098.98 --> 5104.53
that they've wronged everybody I want

5101.53 --> 5107.59
you to see how terrible this person is

5104.53 --> 5110.44
the obvious terrible myths that this

5107.59 --> 5113.2300000000005
person has and he really should change

5110.44 --> 5115.599999999999
okay show's done thank you that's that's

5113.23 --> 5123.669999999999
really all dr. Phil is with every single

5115.6 --> 5129.360000000001
episode right so yeah I don't watch a

5123.67 --> 5133.45
lot of dr. Phil I think finally finally

5129.36 --> 5137.139999999999
because it's it's sudo therapy dr. Phil

5133.45 --> 5139.599999999999
is a pseudo therapy yeah it is sort of

5137.14 --> 5141.070000000001
isn't it my my wife watches it sometimes

5139.6 --> 5143.71
I really don't watch it but I've caught

5141.07 --> 5146.23
a couple episodes and yeah every single

5143.71 --> 5147.37
one of them seems like that it's you

5146.23 --> 5149.349999999999
know I'm gonna I'm gonna bring on

5147.37 --> 5153.07
someone that like obviously is doing the

5149.35 --> 5155.200000000001
wrong thing or stole something yeah and

5153.07 --> 5158.83
just it's addicted to medication or

5155.2 --> 5163.42
whatever yeah I think Jerry Springer was

5158.83 --> 5165.3099999999995
more real than that yeah at least these

5163.42 --> 5169.05
people were genuinely trying to kill

5165.31 --> 5169.05
each other and bash each other's headed

5169.41 --> 5175.8099999999995
yep I'm sorry that was more than likely

5173.23 --> 5179.08
a [ __ ] as hell

5175.81 --> 5181.6
dr. Bowen tration but just from the coma

5179.08 --> 5184.3
I was decent it sounded more like dr.

5181.6 --> 5189.55
Phil than I then anyone would expect a

5184.3 --> 5192.1
few jazz so go cheese man well thanks

5189.55 --> 5193.429
for having me anyway and and not kicking

5192.1 --> 5196.400000000001
me sir

5193.429 --> 5201.89
it's never too late for that though I'm

5196.4 --> 5204.199
gonna snipe just just because you

5201.89 --> 5208.159000000001
believe in the ball jazz doesn't mean

5204.199 --> 5211.19
you're alike you know you have to

5208.159 --> 5213.139999999999
breathe oxygen or participate in a

5211.19 --> 5215.799999999999
conversation like some of these people

5213.14 --> 5217.3
in the chat the [ __ ] deranged

5215.8 --> 5220.64
lunatics

5217.3 --> 5224.110000000001
they don't talk bad about my chat my

5220.64 --> 5226.610000000001
chat is not that bad debates however

5224.11 --> 5230.12
some of the people in that shot up

5226.61 --> 5232.099999999999
pretty bad the the judgment like

5230.12 --> 5236.0599999999995
judgment mode activated

5232.1 --> 5238.429
they love to judge love it they've all

5236.06 --> 5241.6990000000005
gotten to begin about everybody and how

5238.429 --> 5247.34
all these who and what SWAT and it's so

5241.699 --> 5250.009999999999
breweries Moreau that that's one thing

5247.34 --> 5256.400000000001
you gotta respect about our man is no

5250.01 --> 5260.0
shame no shame excuse it like don't let

5256.4 --> 5263.179
the chat influence you like yeah I was

5260.0 --> 5266.39
like what are you talking about I have

5263.179 --> 5269.21
no shame you just like like there's just

5266.39 --> 5271.64
no nothing nobody could say thank you

5269.21 --> 5274.46
that's gonna bring your vibrations down

5271.64 --> 5277.429
your your all your own right thank you

5274.46 --> 5280.01
you do know why right because I do no

5277.429 --> 5282.38
shame and I'm working very hard to make

5280.01 --> 5284.650000000001
sure that I don't do stupid shameful

5282.38 --> 5284.650000000001
things

5285.25 --> 5293.27
Tesla sometimes like Snape sniping James

5288.59 --> 5297.85
was kind of like on the edge for me nor

5293.27 --> 5297.85
wise but I just I just felt like it

5301.36 --> 5307.339999999999
sorry J again did you wouldn't that be

5306.159 --> 5310.19
James

5307.34 --> 5313.76
Johnson's belief like knowing belief but

5310.19 --> 5315.949
don't want to use it no slick James

5313.76 --> 5320.42
Johnson suppose she doesn't know any

5315.949 --> 5323.2699999999995
belief he just has it his experience no

5320.42 --> 5327.26
he's a he's a total fanatical needle in

5323.27 --> 5329.84
links he doesn't believe right well yeah

5327.26 --> 5332.21
but he doesn't he ignores them as well

5329.84 --> 5333.08
he's a total fanatical knee list

5332.21 --> 5335.09
seriously

5333.08 --> 5337.91
isn't that why is it that why you put

5335.09 --> 5340.33
yourself in the conversation is you put

5337.91 --> 5344.739
yourself here to have your beliefs

5340.33 --> 5347.57
challenged right isn't that what we do

5344.739 --> 5349.82
the best looks not here that's a good

5347.57 --> 5351.2
question you know I mean but like if

5349.82 --> 5353.66
you're if you're not here to have your

5351.2 --> 5356.33
beliefs challenged then why are you here

5353.66 --> 5358.19
if you're gonna put yourself in a place

5356.33 --> 5361.88
to where nobody can challenge one of

5358.19 --> 5363.32
your arguments and why are you here I'm

5361.88 --> 5365.66
better than you because I don't have

5363.32 --> 5368.12
beliefs I just have experience and

5365.66 --> 5370.67
knowledge yeah that he doesn't actually

5368.12 --> 5373.91
want to share with anyone when that was

5370.67 --> 5380.57
asked about it it's his private exam yes

5373.91 --> 5381.79
don't ask me about your beliefs no

5380.57 --> 5384.41
further questions

5381.79 --> 5386.62
I'll just leave it at that no further

5384.41 --> 5386.62
questions

5386.83 --> 5395.239
yeah flick-flick James he simply uses I

5393.5 --> 5397.19
mean he's got positions about things

5395.239 --> 5399.679999999999
which essentially are beliefs he just

5397.19 --> 5401.41
doesn't want to recognize it it doesn't

5399.68 --> 5404.450000000001
want to recognize that he actually uses

5401.41 --> 5408.08
epistemology just like everybody else he

5404.45 --> 5410.0
just wants to basically plate say not

5408.08 --> 5413.09
get cornered and not have to proclaim

5410.0 --> 5415.61
any beliefs of his that's it

5413.09 --> 5418.85
slick James just wants to turn on on

5415.61 --> 5420.83
everybody else and make it to where he

5418.85 --> 5423.320000000001
doesn't have to be cornered or ask any

5420.83 --> 5425.63
hard questions about any of his

5423.32 --> 5426.59
positions and that's that's really the

5425.63 --> 5428.18
reason why he does it

5426.59 --> 5430.37
at least that's that's what I think I

5428.18 --> 5436.13
have the experience in a panel which

5430.37 --> 5440.15
took James medal or yes I I was on I was

5436.13 --> 5443.33
on a couple of Jose JG Gonzalez's with

5440.15 --> 5446.989
him and afterwards we had a very long

5443.33 --> 5449.51
talk with it was grimby me and Sir James

5446.989 --> 5451.73
Johnson for a very long time all right

5449.51 --> 5453.47
trying to trying to suss out what he was

5451.73 --> 5456.11
all about I

5453.47 --> 5458.780000000001
I think his I think it's really simple

5456.11 --> 5464.9
I've interacted with him

5458.78 --> 5466.509999999999
now and there's some people in depending

5464.9 --> 5471.11
what circle you're in

5466.51 --> 5474.5
they say there's knowing is very

5471.11 --> 5477.23
different to believing so when you know

5474.5 --> 5480.38
something like again how to make a

5477.23 --> 5482.24
sandwich you don't need to believe you

5480.38 --> 5484.61
know how to make a sandwich you just

5482.24 --> 5488.15
make the sandwich because you know how

5484.61 --> 5490.5199999999995
to I riding a bike driving a car writing

5488.15 --> 5492.41
a letter sending an email certain things

5490.52 --> 5495.59
you just know how to do you don't need

5492.41 --> 5499.25
to you know when you know you know it's

5495.59 --> 5501.26
it really is basic and he finds a

5499.25 --> 5505.27
humorous that so many people are caught

5501.26 --> 5508.400000000001
in what he calls a belief system and

5505.27 --> 5511.52
that some people are ruled by the belief

5508.4 --> 5514.19
system and then the belief police come

5511.52 --> 5516.14
in from anybody leaving the belief

5514.19 --> 5518.69
system it's like well how can you not

5516.14 --> 5520.43
have bullet and it all gets like that so

5518.69 --> 5521.929999999999
I see what you're coming from but I

5520.43 --> 5527.6
don't think it's that he doesn't have a

5521.93 --> 5530.39
position again again again

5527.6 --> 5532.22
he has positions on things he just

5530.39 --> 5535.34
doesn't want to recognize them as

5532.22 --> 5538.22
beliefs because to him he thinks belief

5535.34 --> 5540.35
always means that you have agnosticism

5538.22 --> 5543.110000000001
on a certain position meaning you don't

5540.35 --> 5546.05
you don't fully understand it enough to

5543.11 --> 5547.849999999999
make a very sure position on on it

5546.05 --> 5550.28
that's what he thinks a belief is but

5547.85 --> 5551.18
that's really not what a belief is and

5550.28 --> 5554.33
that's all

5551.18 --> 5556.51
I mean and he also finds it a very

5554.33 --> 5559.61
convenient way of ducking out of

5556.51 --> 5561.530000000001
conversations if someone is trying to

5559.61 --> 5564.2
find out what his position on something

5561.53 --> 5567.86
is and that's that's really all it is

5564.2 --> 5571.07
he's kind of being a coward this dog

5567.86 --> 5572.95
skin just asking the neck very talk to

5571.07 --> 5576.049999999999
say what's your position on this

5572.95 --> 5579.86
seriously I tried doing that he doesn't

5576.05 --> 5583.01
yet he doesn't want to say okay if you

5579.86 --> 5587.8099999999995
tried you try anyway sorry I don't mean

5583.01 --> 5589.7
to derail don't worry about it I'm it's

5587.81 --> 5593.2300000000005
kind of nice to have people talking back

5589.7 --> 5596.87
and forth from the panel so I can do

5593.23 --> 5599.0
hangout management at the same time you

5596.87 --> 5604.19
just want to eat are with now already

5599.0 --> 5606.59
done eating oh no question are like what

5604.19 --> 5624.219999999999
are you sipping I always see green tea

5606.59 --> 5627.08
green tea - I was posed redoing uh I

5624.22 --> 5630.08
haven't really talked him face to face

5627.08 --> 5632.51
yet but I did he did I did see him in

5630.08 --> 5636.11
chat the other day I think he's doing

5632.51 --> 5636.71
alright he's probably kind of busy holy

5636.11 --> 5639.0199999999995
sheeps

5636.71 --> 5649.33
yeah sheeps in the note weights well he

5639.02 --> 5657.31
talks it's only sheeple can't see yep

5649.33 --> 5668.75
yep yep he enjoys your company to our

5657.31 --> 5677.47
yeah he's a great enlightened guy very

5668.75 --> 5680.5
warm very soft all right fellas I'm Alan

5677.47 --> 5684.400000000001
thanks for having me and not kicking me

5680.5 --> 5688.25
don't worry about it you didn't push it

5684.4 --> 5692.0199999999995
and Meryl good to see you bye yeah you'd

5688.25 --> 5692.02
see a definite always

5692.2 --> 5702.65
despite their differences you know yeah

5700.36 --> 5705.259999999999
alright I'll see you around

5702.65 --> 5709.04
yeah the show can still go on by the way

5705.26 --> 5712.1900000000005
it still twenty more minutes if you want

5709.04 --> 5715.25
to continue the conversation or if

5712.19 --> 5716.8099999999995
everybody's done with this I can round

5715.25 --> 5719.15
out the show whatever you guys think

5716.81 --> 5721.910000000001
want to go on for another 20 minutes or

5719.15 --> 5723.11
so well I mean first thing I mean I want

5721.91 --> 5724.7699999999995
to say it's like there's no good

5723.11 --> 5728.099999999999
fighting jazz

5724.77 --> 5729.540000000001
the second thing is I thank you Thank

5728.1 --> 5731.55
You Armen I was waiting for your

5729.54 --> 5733.5
invitation I finally got him here and

5731.55 --> 5735.33
shout out to you and everybody else on

5733.5 --> 5738.09
this panel it's a great conversation so

5735.33 --> 5742.17
far yeah she is so she is for the

5738.09 --> 5743.91
wingman thank you I was like I always

5742.17 --> 5745.56
like a panel where people can actually

5743.91 --> 5749.79
discuss even though they have completely

5745.56 --> 5751.59
different antithetical views on or no I

5749.79 --> 5755.94
wouldn't say antithetical but this

5751.59 --> 5757.71
Verret views on things so it's nice it's

5755.94 --> 5760.5
nice when it doesn't get into a dumpster

5757.71 --> 5763.47
fire type of thing yeah yeah you don't

5760.5 --> 5766.35
have to attack up you know the certain

5763.47 --> 5768.54
things just need to be cleared up and it

5766.35 --> 5772.320000000001
yeah there are still a level of honesty

5768.54 --> 5775.71
that is yeah that I will keep on working

5772.32 --> 5776.25
on so yeah like getting the questions

5775.71 --> 5778.74
answered

5776.25 --> 5779.79
like jazakallah came on started about

5778.74 --> 5782.099999999999
atmospheric pressure

5779.79 --> 5785.19
I basically hinted at is it gas pressure

5782.1 --> 5788.400000000001
and you managed to not address it the

5785.19 --> 5789.929999999999
entire and out so that's actually why I

5788.4 --> 5794.19
wanted to come on let's answer that

5789.93 --> 5796.530000000001
question I felt he tried to but um it's

5794.19 --> 5799.65
actually a simple answer it's um it's

5796.53 --> 5801.03
not too difficult it's it's not in the

5799.65 --> 5802.74
same sense that you're thinking about

5801.03 --> 5806.94
with the second law it's not that type

5802.74 --> 5808.23
of contained gas pressure but it is it's

5806.94 --> 5810.48
actually classified differently so

5808.23 --> 5813.0
atmospheric pressure and it's due to the

5810.48 --> 5816.0
weight of the air above it so at every

5813.0 --> 5817.62
point every point that it's that you can

5816.0 --> 5821.07
test it anywhere and so you don't

5817.62 --> 5822.54
actually need a solid surface you could

5821.07 --> 5825.0599999999995
test it anywhere in the atmosphere and

5822.54 --> 5832.17
what you'll measure is the weight of the

5825.06 --> 5837.030000000001
atmosphere at that given point right so

5832.17 --> 5838.83
you put up a scale you can weigh the

5837.03 --> 5840.75
weight off the atmosphere so you put up

5838.83 --> 5846.84
a scale somewhere and then it's gonna

5840.75 --> 5851.58
weigh all of the ways a barometer but

5846.84 --> 5854.400000000001
yeah yeah hey hey barometer measures

5851.58 --> 5856.38
that mysteric pressure it's not like a

5854.4 --> 5858.69
scale a kitchen scale that you step on

5856.38 --> 5861.900000000001
right okay interesting of

5858.69 --> 5864.8099999999995
yeah atmospheric pressure is still gas

5861.9 --> 5868.799999999999
pressure that's alright well that's what

5864.81 --> 5872.04
it's about so this person you're going

5868.8 --> 5873.99
peanuts nice pressure yeah I'm all right

5872.04 --> 5876.29
hey thanks for stopping by and being

5873.99 --> 5878.099999999999
part of the panel see you later peanuts

5876.29 --> 5880.88
guys see ya later

5878.1 --> 5888.92
hey you guys make good choices alright

5880.88 --> 5895.13
try o to decide that's I leave already

5888.92 --> 5897.78
no nice he's put his camera oh yeah oh

5895.13 --> 5901.35
okay cool cool cuz it was actually I

5897.78 --> 5903.48
think it was you who who brought it up I

5901.35 --> 5905.070000000001
think or you'd said something about the

5903.48 --> 5906.87
gas pressures that is what I wonder

5905.07 --> 5909.12
I was only bringing it up because I

5906.87 --> 5911.21
think you asked a question I just forget

5909.12 --> 5918.75
what your question was

5911.21 --> 5923.46
alright what's right the attraction I've

5918.75 --> 5933.87
just we need to know why it's talking

5923.46 --> 5936.51
Chris yeah cut down the swing please I'm

5933.87 --> 5938.76
sorry guys I can swear I'm not I'm not

5936.51 --> 5940.860000000001
understanding what you mean by canceling

5938.76 --> 5943.530000000001
it out what do you mean by that well I

5940.86 --> 5946.339999999999
mean well if for example if we're gonna

5943.53 --> 5949.679999999999
do an observation with the chamber here

5946.34 --> 5955.29
on earth and do studies regarding upon

5949.68 --> 5956.79
gravity but it just it doesn't prove me

5955.29 --> 5959.37
too much that that chamber is really

5956.79 --> 5963.12
analogous to death to space itself but

5959.37 --> 5966.24
it's not what it presumes to be because

5963.12 --> 5968.03
you know I mean if it is if it is

5966.24 --> 5970.83
supposed to be a chamber it should be

5968.03 --> 5973.11
really floating in a sense I shouldn't

5970.83 --> 5974.58
see any attraction okay that's why

5973.11 --> 5976.38
that's what I wanted to bring up was

5974.58 --> 5978.54
yeah when I said earlier nothing's

5976.38 --> 5979.11
floating because it's true nothing is

5978.54 --> 5980.88
floating

5979.11 --> 5983.04
neither something is in orbit or it's

5980.88 --> 5984.900000000001
falling towards the Earth and so the

5983.04 --> 5987.36
reason why they make vacuum chambers to

5984.9 --> 5988.62
test these things is not because once

5987.36 --> 5990.719999999999
it's in a vacuum chamber it has some

5988.62 --> 5992.19
magical property which like makes it

5990.72 --> 5995.16
float or something it's

5992.19 --> 5996.719
because there's there's in the

5995.16 --> 6002.66
atmosphere is actually getting in the

5996.719 --> 6010.449
way it creates an option everyone still

6002.66 --> 6010.449
talks going and I'm not doing my brows

6015.94 --> 6021.469
hold on stop it stop it

6018.83 --> 6028.58
look Delft has a an actual speech

6021.469 --> 6035.17
impediment he actually doesn't have a

6028.58 --> 6039.53
speech impediment really that's crazy

6035.17 --> 6046.16
yeah sounds like him it's Chris I assure

6039.53 --> 6048.139999999999
you I give you my word okay well if he

6046.16 --> 6051.0199999999995
wants the Chris wants to play his new

6048.14 --> 6053.12
character that has a speech impediment

6051.02 --> 6057.59
he can do that if he wants to what if

6053.12 --> 6059.719
you will think some toys yeah I will

6057.59 --> 6061.16
have to I kind of make out what you're

6059.719 --> 6062.87
saying though because if I can't

6061.16 --> 6065.75
understand you then there's no real

6062.87 --> 6071.09
conversation here so please try to be a

6065.75 --> 6073.55
little bit more clear so let's give him

6071.09 --> 6076.46
the bad brother down then I'm sure what

6073.55 --> 6085.79
he has to say now on you go

6076.46 --> 6087.29
everyone takes on the time okay right

6085.79 --> 6093.28
with the atmosphere though the reason

6087.29 --> 6093.28
why you do it in a vacuum it's not fun

6095.949 --> 6103.669
sorry Arwen you really should get rid of

6099.409 --> 6105.799999999999
someone like yeah okay Dell yeah you

6103.669 --> 6108.139
know you have to take yourself seriously

6105.8 --> 6110.899
like at all times on the internet say

6108.139 --> 6113.119
yeah look no guy with the speech

6110.899 --> 6116.139
impediment is going to actually have a

6113.119 --> 6123.558999999999
spasm near an open mic like that that's

6116.139 --> 6124.689
nobody's that ridiculous so try again

6123.559 --> 6126.769
later

6124.689 --> 6130.879
that's all good I mean that's what

6126.769 --> 6134.629
happens on hangout I hope he's okay um

6130.879 --> 6136.07
yeah okay yeah so the only reason you do

6134.629 --> 6137.329
it in a vacuum chamber is not because it

6136.07 --> 6140.299999999999
gives us a material property it's just

6137.329 --> 6141.438999999999
to make it so it's clear of the air the

6140.3 --> 6143.869000000001
air is gonna get in the way and it's

6141.439 --> 6146.570000000001
gonna create a drag effect or the drag

6143.869 --> 6148.308999999999
force on say a feather in a rock the

6146.57 --> 6150.289
rocks not gonna be subjected to the drag

6148.309 --> 6152.719
because it's much heavier and it has

6150.289 --> 6155.509999999999
less aerodynamic or is more aerodynamic

6152.719 --> 6157.369
a feather is lighter it will fall so if

6155.51 --> 6159.499
you do it in a vacuum it's just like

6157.369 --> 6162.289
dropping two things down the airs freak

6159.499 --> 6166.959
show no drag air friction no that that

6162.289 --> 6166.959
those are the same thing those means

6172.61 --> 6179.719999999999
anyway yeah sure but yeah I don't see

6176.73 --> 6182.879999999999
what the point is really things do

6179.72 --> 6186.93
relative density still works even within

6182.88 --> 6189.6
a created vacuum chamber because yeah

6186.93 --> 6191.820000000001
all that material still has a relative

6189.6 --> 6193.8
density and it is still within the

6191.82 --> 6198.299999999999
entire spectrum of things that has a

6193.8 --> 6201.6
relative density spectrum so things will

6198.3 --> 6205.02
still move towards where the higher

6201.6 --> 6207.75
density equilibrium point is if it has

6205.02 --> 6210.75
any maneuver Darwin or when are you

6207.75 --> 6214.26
trying to say that the relative density

6210.75 --> 6216.3
of an object to the environment it's in

6214.26 --> 6218.43
it determines its weight is that what

6216.3 --> 6223.41
you're saying no weight has nothing to

6218.43 --> 6225.71
do with it okay I don't think that has

6223.41 --> 6233.16
to do with it is its relative density

6225.71 --> 6235.08
not just the mass follow McMath it's

6233.16 --> 6237.12
about the mass versus the volume that's

6235.08 --> 6239.85
the relative density and in that sense

6237.12 --> 6241.71
it will specifically seek an equilibrium

6239.85 --> 6244.5
point within the relative that the

6241.71 --> 6247.68
natural relative density spectrum as it

6244.5 --> 6252.06
will well that's not sort of trivial

6247.68 --> 6255.3
because density is mass you know a

6252.06 --> 6257.52
volume of mass a certain mass within a

6255.3 --> 6260.570000000001
volume is density no it is relative

6257.52 --> 6268.68
density is a specific relation between

6260.57 --> 6273.9
the mass and the volume and that yes it

6268.68 --> 6276.450000000001
is that's why well why did you have an

6273.9 --> 6278.879999999999
empty you know water jug even empty

6276.45 --> 6280.32
water jug and you have a stone ball and

6278.88 --> 6282.18
you have a leg oh I don't you have a

6280.32 --> 6284.46
bunch of stuff you drop them they all

6282.18 --> 6286.38
drop and land in the same place that's

6284.46 --> 6288.27
not like one's gonna not fall all the

6286.38 --> 6289.62
way to the ground and the other ones are

6288.27 --> 6290.85
gonna they fall different levels

6289.62 --> 6292.44
everything's gonna fall all the way to

6290.85 --> 6294.56
the ground that's right so because that

6292.44 --> 6297.0599999999995
is where the relative density

6294.56 --> 6299.1
equilibrium for solid objects and even

6297.06 --> 6302.610000000001
water of

6299.1 --> 6305.369000000001
things are solid that average relative

6302.61 --> 6306.989
density that's where their wall

6305.369 --> 6309.179
that's where they will displace do you

6306.989 --> 6311.07
want any if you want any dressing with

6309.179 --> 6314.6990000000005
that salad like that didn't explain

6311.07 --> 6317.58
anything I'm using the terminology as

6314.699 --> 6317.969
given that that is how relative density

6317.58 --> 6320.82
works

6317.969 --> 6322.86
I don't like it personally okay I had to

6320.82 --> 6325.799999999999
sit through this [ __ ] while I was trying

6322.86 --> 6328.08
to defend the concept of it doesn't I

6325.8 --> 6334.349
have no idea where you got that but it's

6328.08 --> 6336.389
just no no that's you not understanding

6334.349 --> 6338.4890000000005
it it's not word salad it's literally

6336.389 --> 6342.3
you not understanding it because

6338.489 --> 6345.48
otherwise you would be able to explain

6342.3 --> 6348.6900000000005
exactly how it is wrong so you not

6345.48 --> 6350.759999999999
understanding it can you not talk

6348.69 --> 6353.79
through me while I'm talking please I

6350.76 --> 6357.75
can't explain how potato is wrong I mean

6353.79 --> 6359.46
oh no you can can actually do that if

6357.75 --> 6363.239
you understand what you're listening to

6359.46 --> 6365.4
then you can address exactly what is out

6363.239 --> 6367.379999999999
of context or what is wrong about it or

6365.4 --> 6369.03
what is irrelevant about it but just

6367.38 --> 6372.33
calling things word salad without

6369.03 --> 6374.82
actually going into why or what about it

6372.33 --> 6377.58
is supposedly word salad just hand way

6374.82 --> 6379.049999999999
of dismissing that's not an argument but

6377.58 --> 6381.42
I didn't say word salad I gave you an

6379.05 --> 6383.34
example of why it's then why did doesn't

6381.42 --> 6389.13
make sense I wasn't talking to you

6383.34 --> 6391.1990000000005
you're not the one why but are when you

6389.13 --> 6394.409000000001
you commented on what he was saying

6391.199 --> 6397.169999999999
about the empty gun and what I had a

6394.409 --> 6399.9
problem with was what you said after he

6397.17 --> 6401.55
gave the Lego and whatever else it is

6399.9 --> 6403.348999999999
the metal ball or whatever the metal

6401.55 --> 6406.77
ball in the Lego example on the judge

6403.349 --> 6410.33
and the water density right and it just

6406.77 --> 6414.900000000001
went off thank you a crazy word selling

6410.33 --> 6418.349
no that's just relative density the

6414.9 --> 6420.239
concept how it the model for it okay

6418.349 --> 6423.110000000001
it's a model it's technically you can

6420.239 --> 6426.119
model it's that well-defined really

6423.11 --> 6428.339999999999
relative density of the model okay no

6426.119 --> 6432.509999999999
you can model it it is scientifically

6428.34 --> 6435.659000000001
proven fact but you can actually model

6432.51 --> 6438.649
it it's not that complex it is actually

6435.659 --> 6441.478999999999
annoyingly simplistic that is again

6438.649 --> 6446.129
can you explain to me again exactly what

6441.479 --> 6451.129
relative density is okay relative

6446.129 --> 6454.8589999999995
density is what causes displacement

6451.129 --> 6458.28
naturally of things in this world by the

6454.859 --> 6461.069
matter trying to depending on its

6458.28 --> 6463.679
relative density find its relative

6461.069 --> 6466.729
density equilibrium point within the

6463.679 --> 6469.619
spectrum of all things of all matter

6466.729 --> 6475.409000000001
which just happens to be downward under

6469.619 --> 6478.8589999999995
no no it doesn't doesn't know it's not

6475.409 --> 6481.679
always downwards that's why you get

6478.859 --> 6484.859
relative radians because gravity is an

6481.679 --> 6488.579
acting on no it's an assumption same way

6484.859 --> 6491.069
it's a one-way assumption and there's no

6488.579 --> 6494.209
proof for it it's a concept you can't

6491.069 --> 6496.919000000001
actually obviously point out how it is

6494.209 --> 6500.549
affecting everything you can't pinpoint

6496.919 --> 6502.53
it you can only deduce it you're

6500.549 --> 6504.899
basically describing what gravity does

6502.53 --> 6508.349
and you just want to now what you assume

6504.899 --> 6511.289000000001
it does without proving that it is

6508.349 --> 6513.089
actually a physical real thing you just

6511.289 --> 6515.188999999999
assume that it does that because the

6513.089 --> 6518.159
pattern you learned for it works out

6515.189 --> 6521.819
really things it's just not far away

6518.159 --> 6523.709
real Arwen or for someone that that

6521.819 --> 6525.329000000001
complains when you get talked over you

6523.709 --> 6527.76
talk over everybody

6525.329 --> 6532.018999999999
oh yeah that's because my hangout it's

6527.76 --> 6533.819
my hangout I can do yeah it's a luxury

6532.019 --> 6535.679
be glad that I don't talk for

6533.819 --> 6538.01
three-quarters of the time like Nathan

6535.679 --> 6541.349
does when he has guests um I thought

6538.01 --> 6543.809
okay so basically somebody else doing

6541.349 --> 6545.539
something wrong is you and you should do

6543.809 --> 6551.069
it less wrong that's what we just said

6545.539 --> 6554.6089999999995
yeah I did oh god oh god okay well are

6551.069 --> 6558.329000000001
you do you consider yourself open to

6554.609 --> 6561.659000000001
learning from other people that if

6558.329 --> 6564.839
anyone has anything new for me to learn

6561.659 --> 6566.8189999999995
I will absolutely listen to it but yeah

6564.839 --> 6568.919
the things I'm getting from you guys

6566.819 --> 6571.829000000001
especially in your argumentation but

6568.919 --> 6575.639
only so fastly recycled that I

6571.829 --> 6579.03
literally act act completely like a

6575.639 --> 6581.03
baller and if you'd not not recognize my

6579.03 --> 6583.559
voice not see my face you'd never

6581.03 --> 6586.228999999999
realized that I wasn't a baller because

6583.559 --> 6588.179
I know all of the arguments that well

6586.229 --> 6589.919
because I've heard them so many times

6588.179 --> 6592.169
because they're always the same they

6589.919 --> 6594.51
really are they're structurally the same

6592.169 --> 6595.679
it's always the same process sometimes

6594.51 --> 6598.349
with another piece

6595.679 --> 6600.839
added on there eventually or a hyper

6598.349 --> 6602.939
speculation in some way it's always the

6600.839 --> 6605.55
same system because I've been in that

6602.939 --> 6608.939
system I've learned you know our window

6605.55 --> 6610.679
Arwen are when a globe earther can say

6608.939 --> 6612.149
the same thing who's been in these

6610.679 --> 6613.349
communities for a while I mean I've been

6612.149 --> 6615.329000000001
in these communities for a while

6613.349 --> 6617.339
probably four or five years apparently

6615.329 --> 6619.619
and you know what barely you know what

6617.339 --> 6621.749
there's very little Globus that really

6619.619 --> 6624.478999999999
understand the Flat Earth concepts like

6621.749 --> 6626.07
the optics let all that they've done yet

6624.479 --> 6628.649
who under it's and where it's at

6626.07 --> 6631.289
understand Flat Earth concepts but what

6628.649 --> 6634.109
you just said was that we we parrot

6631.289 --> 6636.329
things a lot I see way more parroting

6634.109 --> 6640.019
from the planner talking about parenting

6636.329 --> 6642.869
that's not what I said if every time

6640.019 --> 6645.570000000001
someone said show me the curve it's not

6642.869 --> 6648.78
what I said I didn't say parroting I

6645.57 --> 6651.959
said that your line of reasoning is

6648.78 --> 6654.329
always built on the same old comes metal

6651.959 --> 6657.749
metal slugs how long have you been

6654.329 --> 6660.539
looking into this subject for quite a

6657.749 --> 6665.179
while and how much is that how long held

6660.539 --> 6665.179
on and off I guess and how much say

6665.629 --> 6672.959
probably four or five years now you

6668.76 --> 6678.119000000001
think it takes a long time to get your

6672.959 --> 6680.459
head around this subject no what would

6678.119 --> 6682.829
you well ease I mean it it shouldn't it

6680.459 --> 6685.559
shouldn't take real long I'm not asking

6682.829 --> 6691.099
if it should a mass he's asking if it

6685.559 --> 6696.089
does not what it should do please

6691.099 --> 6699.889
because on my paper will I know people

6696.089 --> 6704.0689999999995
that a ball is okay that have no idea

6699.889 --> 6705.689
what the heliocentric model even is but

6704.069 --> 6709.38
then I know people

6705.689 --> 6710.969
who have an interest in science some

6709.38 --> 6714.150000000001
people have interest in space

6710.969 --> 6716.4
exploration and the potential of going

6714.15 --> 6718.739
to another planet and then there's some

6716.4 --> 6722.159
people who just don't think about stuff

6718.739 --> 6723.928999999999
like that so it's weird when I I'll the

6722.159 --> 6728.429
fourth Flat Earth I always had these

6723.929 --> 6730.409
kind of interests but when I realized

6728.429 --> 6732.2390000000005
that there was a because I was talking

6730.409 --> 6735.478999999999
about this kind of stuff in high school

6732.239 --> 6737.879999999999
in in that with some of my friends we

6735.479 --> 6739.650000000001
joked about it like I remember people

6737.88 --> 6741.659000000001
used to think that the earth was flat

6739.65 --> 6744.329
and you could sail off the edge like

6741.659 --> 6746.638999999999
what what idiots kind of thing and look

6744.329 --> 6749.429
at science and how far we've come and

6746.639 --> 6753.900000000001
all that kind of thing but when when I

6749.429 --> 6757.499
realized it was a question I really went

6753.9 --> 6759.869
in like a lot of people I guess to

6757.499 --> 6765.209
debunk it you know like oh what's this

6759.869 --> 6767.759999999999
[ __ ] [ __ ] you know dude yeah it's

6765.209 --> 6772.65
been very interesting experience like I

6767.76 --> 6775.1990000000005
I had the luxury that I had time to

6772.65 --> 6777.209
really dig into it not everybody does

6775.199 --> 6781.438999999999
because you know they got you know a

6777.209 --> 6786.179
family or different things but like I I

6781.439 --> 6791.219
actually got to a point where it was

6786.179 --> 6794.809
quite alarming in a way to be fair that

6791.219 --> 6800.849
I was looking for the globe and then I

6794.809 --> 6806.519
couldn't find it okay seemed to just

6800.849 --> 6810.2390000000005
vanish into thin air and I just wonder

6806.519 --> 6812.280000000001
like what why that doesn't happen for

6810.239 --> 6816.539
more people especially when they look at

6812.28 --> 6818.909
it but how can it not just just vaporize

6816.539 --> 6821.518999999999
because they're caught up so in the

6818.909 --> 6826.768999999999
dream because it's a vast body of

6821.519 --> 6828.599
knowledge that has vaporized like like

6826.769 --> 6830.219
suddenly one day you just thought oh I

6828.599 --> 6837.2390000000005
don't believe globe anymore I don't see

6830.219 --> 6839.9
it no I looked for it like in every nook

6837.239 --> 6843.599999999999
and cranny encyclopedia

6839.9 --> 6847.44
from Carl Sagan all the way up to the

6843.6 --> 6850.200000000001
modern yeah Bill Nye and [ __ ] De

6847.44 --> 6852.509999999999
Grasse and Cox and the whole crew right

6850.2 --> 6855.54
to the moon landing the whole bit like

6852.51 --> 6858.42
the whole thing fell down like a house

6855.54 --> 6861.54
of cards yeah but you can there's

6858.42 --> 6863.4
there's there's globe everywhere in

6861.54 --> 6864.63
media and I'm not sure what you mean

6863.4 --> 6867.0599999999995
then because I mean you can get but

6864.63 --> 6869.82
that's that's visual that's not the

6867.06 --> 6872.25
actual proof what Marilla saying he was

6869.82 --> 6874.739
looking for an actual proof a globe on

6872.25 --> 6881.58
there right why do you think that would

6874.739 --> 6884.04
be I mean is it presenting proof is

6881.58 --> 6887.85
seeing hold on let me ask a question is

6884.04 --> 6895.4
seeing a ball spin in the background on

6887.85 --> 6898.59
the news is that proof of the globe no

6895.4 --> 6903.139999999999
right so what Merle was saying earlier

6898.59 --> 6907.2
he at some point really wanted to know

6903.14 --> 6911.4890000000005
not just accept what the consensus but

6907.2 --> 6913.38
just like okay I I for myself now want

6911.489 --> 6915.0
to get to the bottom of this and really

6913.38 --> 6918.6900000000005
find the proof for the globe and he did

6915.0 --> 6920.7
it so he said and then you run into a

6918.69 --> 6923.58
lot of problems that it's not so

6920.7 --> 6926.97
straightforward as you assume it is when

6923.58 --> 6929.37
you start out questioning it and he's

6926.97 --> 6932.570000000001
asking why don't allowed of people do

6929.37 --> 6936.63
this I know exactly why they don't

6932.57 --> 6941.46
because being really curious about the

6936.63 --> 6943.95
truth is not culturally preferenced in

6941.46 --> 6949.2300000000005
this age it's being actively discouraged

6943.95 --> 6951.9
and consensus work choosing the the

6949.23 --> 6955.29
winner going along to get along

6951.9 --> 6958.759999999999
that type of decision-making is highly

6955.29 --> 6963.2699999999995
encouraged it has been for over a decade

6958.76 --> 6965.39
it's being encouraged it's been

6963.27 --> 6967.650000000001
encouraged through media through

6965.39 --> 6970.71
programming through new television

6967.65 --> 6971.4
series and game shows everything they

6970.71 --> 6973.2300000000005
can to

6971.4 --> 6974.91
the type of characters they put down

6973.23 --> 6977.4
there they always put the same types

6974.91 --> 6984.24
there all that delve into this type of

6977.4 --> 6987.299999999999
behavior I mean that everybody is know

6984.24 --> 6989.76
but it does mean that it's much harder

6987.3 --> 6992.58
to actually get to the point that you

6989.76 --> 6995.070000000001
can decide for yourself I'm gonna not

6992.58 --> 6996.57
listen to every way anyone any more and

6995.07 --> 7000.32
I'm just really gonna get to the bottom

6996.57 --> 7004.49
of this that type of reaction that type

7000.32 --> 7009.349999999999
of act is being culturally highly

7004.49 --> 7011.9
discouraged in general I you know it you

7009.35 --> 7014.990000000001
know you know we have we have all this

7011.9 --> 7016.79
information at our at our fingertips now

7014.99 --> 7019.94
I'd actually say it's it's actually

7016.79 --> 7022.76
easier I mean you can you you can yeah

7019.94 --> 7026.2699999999995
but as long as you go with it as long as

7022.76 --> 7029.21
you go with the flow well that's what I

7026.27 --> 7030.830000000001
wanted to say Armin go with the flow go

7029.21 --> 7033.2300000000005
with the Consensus go with the

7030.83 --> 7035.57
acceptable information go with what

7033.23 --> 7038.929999999999
everybody thinks it's okay to learn

7035.57 --> 7041.09
about yeah that's that's that's not what

7038.93 --> 7042.9800000000005
I'm thinking about go would be with the

7041.09 --> 7044.96
flow because if you're gonna be using

7042.98 --> 7047.2699999999995
the Internet like everybody on this

7044.96 --> 7049.82
panel is using right now wouldn't you

7047.27 --> 7051.740000000001
say that's quote-unquote going with the

7049.82 --> 7055.69
flow I mean you just have to be very

7051.74 --> 7058.4
selective and be very very careful about

7055.69 --> 7060.98
just accepting things at face value

7058.4 --> 7064.82
whatever you're right well I'm pretty

7060.98 --> 7065.959999999999
sure that did not just the regular basic

7064.82 --> 7069.049999999999
standard people

7065.96 --> 7072.02
sorry not trying to be mean to anybody

7069.05 --> 7074.54
but it's not gonna be a general standard

7072.02 --> 7076.580000000001
public that is gonna be watching your

7074.54 --> 7080.24
show well that that's what I wanted to

7076.58 --> 7081.59
take you agree I actually agree with you

7080.24 --> 7083.929999999999
because they can't handle this [ __ ]

7081.59 --> 7086.42
because they're discouraged to do so

7083.93 --> 7088.76
because they don't have the room inside

7086.42 --> 7091.01
of them because of how they've been

7088.76 --> 7093.68
programmed by society and how they have

7091.01 --> 7096.2
let Society program them they don't have

7093.68 --> 7098.990000000001
the room to critically think about

7096.2 --> 7101.74
anything really they just have time to

7098.99 --> 7101.74
be amused

7103.09 --> 7112.91
yeah I was already hold on hold on guys

7105.95 --> 7114.44
yeah yeah yeah yeah I just I've wanted

7112.91 --> 7117.29
to get the chance to tell you cuz I

7114.44 --> 7120.349999999999
actually have a different a different

7117.29 --> 7122.65
story then and I guess the people your

7120.35 --> 7125.3
your you know saying there's a

7122.65 --> 7127.82
mainstream or something because when I

7125.3 --> 7130.04
first heard about this I was compelled I

7127.82 --> 7131.96
was kind of bored awesome so I was

7130.04 --> 7133.94
challenging myself as like you know I'm

7131.96 --> 7135.35
already believing some other

7133.94 --> 7138.86
conspiracies so I was like thinking

7135.35 --> 7144.05
could I be fooled like I try to put

7138.86 --> 7146.42
myself into the place I would except I

7144.05 --> 7148.1900000000005
like I was willing to accept it as long

7146.42 --> 7150.71
as the evidence was there I was willing

7148.19 --> 7153.29
to say okay could I be fooled to the

7150.71 --> 7155.75
degree that you know everything that

7153.29 --> 7158.24
I've been shown has been shown to me by

7155.75 --> 7161.6
schools or you know the media or NASA

7158.24 --> 7165.32
can I figure it out for myself and so I

7161.6 --> 7167.870000000001
think that you know did that instinct

7165.32 --> 7170.63
you know that's that's not that's not

7167.87 --> 7173.12
wrong to question all that but you know

7170.63 --> 7176.68
moral had said how come nobody else

7173.12 --> 7180.23
comes to the conclusion that it's uh

7176.68 --> 7181.7300000000005
because it's only a small challenge

7180.23 --> 7184.669999999999
himself though it's only a small

7181.73 --> 7188.719999999999
percentage of people that have that that

7184.67 --> 7190.31
need really to do that yeah but the

7188.72 --> 7191.89
differences and there's other there's

7190.31 --> 7196.9400000000005
other students that I've heard those

7191.89 --> 7198.14
similar to mine my specific story but

7196.94 --> 7200.48
they didn't come to the conclusion that

7198.14 --> 7206.21
it was flat they booked all the evidence

7200.48 --> 7209.12
and of course they did of course so I

7206.21 --> 7213.68
know that there are narratives and

7209.12 --> 7216.349999999999
editors and you know invested interests

7213.68 --> 7218.3
and all lobby groups it's a bunch of

7216.35 --> 7222.29
things like I'm aware of that a lot of

7218.3 --> 7224.42
people aren't so you can't like when you

7222.29 --> 7227.48
get some new tube in the internet like I

7224.42 --> 7229.31
was there when that began I've seen your

7227.48 --> 7231.379999999999
whole thing on fall and forty three

7229.31 --> 7234.320000000001
years old like maybe I'm just more

7231.38 --> 7236.52
cynical and suspicious than certain

7234.32 --> 7239.099999999999
people that's not about a conspiracy

7236.52 --> 7241.740000000001
that's about human nature in general

7239.1 --> 7244.71
happens with most people that is true

7241.74 --> 7246.57
that's not conspiracy theory I'm not a

7244.71 --> 7251.94
conspiracy theorist I'll never have

7246.57 --> 7255.0599999999995
someone's having a bad day just not

7251.94 --> 7257.339999999999
clarity it's about clarity of times and

7255.06 --> 7260.400000000001
how we define ourselves in each other

7257.34 --> 7262.2300000000005
and I don't like blanket statements and

7260.4 --> 7265.08
people who make assumptions because this

7262.23 --> 7267.75
is too much sure though yeah sure but I

7265.08 --> 7269.4
just agree I agreed with that sentiment

7267.75 --> 7271.08
that's what I said I see when there's

7269.4 --> 7273.379999999999
dark doing there's some things people

7271.08 --> 7276.63
are capable of doing something sinister

7273.38 --> 7278.46
dark whatever and I come it's good to

7276.63 --> 7281.01
look out for those things but I'm saying

7278.46 --> 7282.93
like in this case I looked out for it it

7281.01 --> 7285.63
just didn't happen to be so at least as

7282.93 --> 7295.650000000001
far as I know it's the biggest deception

7285.63 --> 7298.41
there is it's kind of well what is that

7295.65 --> 7300.48
I mean to be honest everybody here at

7298.41 --> 7302.88
this present moment when they go out

7300.48 --> 7304.589999999999
before they go look for a car or a house

7302.88 --> 7307.32
or whatever model that's out there you

7304.59 --> 7308.58
guys gonna you guys gonna study it and

7307.32 --> 7310.29
you gonna price it and you're gonna

7308.58 --> 7312.75
measure it before you buy it before you

7310.29 --> 7314.73
believe into it so if you like it then

7312.75 --> 7316.95
yeah you're gonna buy that model but

7314.73 --> 7322.32
unfortunately for everybody here today

7316.95 --> 7324.51
right now to be true we've been educated

7322.32 --> 7327.15
we did we weren't given the choice to

7324.51 --> 7329.13
accept the model we were bred into it

7327.15 --> 7332.49
and that's why I want to go back to the

7329.13 --> 7334.9800000000005
early discussion asking are what was the

7332.49 --> 7340.11
first time that actually you recognized

7334.98 --> 7341.639999999999
it was a globe so it's kind of our type

7340.11 --> 7344.009999999999
of a programming that we would were

7341.64 --> 7346.08
ready to do we're not gonna question it

7344.01 --> 7348.93
whether if this model is to be true or

7346.08 --> 7350.55
not so that's where we're at today with

7348.93 --> 7352.89
this type of discussion and maybe we

7350.55 --> 7354.93
need to actually redress it as if it is

7352.89 --> 7358.17
that type of object whether if it's a a

7354.93 --> 7360.450000000001
car that you like or a motorcycle or

7358.17 --> 7362.88
whatever it is but the way to put

7360.45 --> 7365.849999999999
actually like a product you need don't

7362.88 --> 7367.47
need to buy because someone was asking

7365.85 --> 7370.68
me about the Big Bang and

7367.47 --> 7372.6
said look I used to believe it and I've

7370.68 --> 7375.18
looked into I've heard I've seen

7372.6 --> 7376.740000000001
documentaries about it diagrams CGI

7375.18 --> 7382.17
[ __ ] demonstrations

7376.74 --> 7384.78
sorry Island but why I then there's a

7382.17 --> 7387.15
point then where you have the choice

7384.78 --> 7389.04
again and the freedom to say well I

7387.15 --> 7395.009999999999
don't buy this anymore

7389.04 --> 7401.73
i boycott this that's that's your choice

7395.01 --> 7403.68
I mean you can even do that yes the

7401.73 --> 7407.219999999999
whole thing's like on offer and up for

7403.68 --> 7409.05
grabs but people will boycott this as

7407.22 --> 7411.33
well they'll move away from it and

7409.05 --> 7413.88
they'll come back to their bearings and

7411.33 --> 7415.98
the earth and the whole idea of going

7413.88 --> 7419.64
into outer space and other planets is

7415.98 --> 7421.379999999999
insane the thing about it though is what

7419.64 --> 7423.780000000001
what precedent do you really have to

7421.38 --> 7427.68
actually just outright deny it because

7423.78 --> 7430.5599999999995
most people most people that have heard

7427.68 --> 7432.240000000001
of Big Bang cosmology they are not

7430.56 --> 7433.860000000001
actually scientists that are crunching

7432.24 --> 7436.0199999999995
the numbers they're not looking at the

7433.86 --> 7438.719999999999
cosmic microwave background radiation

7436.02 --> 7440.64
and stuff like that so it's it's

7438.72 --> 7442.650000000001
generally above a lot of people you have

7440.64 --> 7447.0
to do a lot of specialized training so

7442.65 --> 7454.62
it's not national ice conditioning with

7447.0 --> 7456.57
very very specialized condition of being

7454.62 --> 7458.91
able to deny it because you have

7456.57 --> 7460.91
information on it and because you

7458.91 --> 7464.04
understand it it's a matter of

7460.91 --> 7467.76
understanding other people who have an

7464.04 --> 7469.8
understanding right you have to you have

7467.76 --> 7471.72
to learn very specifically how to

7469.8 --> 7475.110000000001
presuppose all these things that's

7471.72 --> 7477.42
correct it's a very tight discipline how

7475.11 --> 7479.28
do you presuppose all these things to be

7477.42 --> 7481.83
there how can you explain it in a way to

7479.28 --> 7484.41
the public that they'll take the answer

7481.83 --> 7486.96
and be satisfied about it even though it

7484.41 --> 7490.44
doesn't really make any sense or is a

7486.96 --> 7492.66
highly long stretched conclusion based

7490.44 --> 7500.3099999999995
on some kind of deduction of an

7492.66 --> 7501.21
observation yeah well yeah they not

7500.31 --> 7504.26
often

7501.21 --> 7508.29
not off actual scientific evidence just

7504.26 --> 7511.29
conclusion drawn on an observation yes

7508.29 --> 7513.6
you you simply have to make of no that's

7511.29 --> 7516.2699999999995
not the scientific Authority conclusion

7513.6 --> 7523.14
drawn the observation is not the

7516.27 --> 7525.0
scientific method variable which is the

7523.14 --> 7527.31
thing you are trying to scientifically

7525.0 --> 7530.16
prove in order to establish scientific

7527.31 --> 7532.110000000001
proof you have to do that with

7530.16 --> 7534.5599999999995
observations observing things with

7532.11 --> 7538.32
either instrumentation or your senses I

7534.56 --> 7539.700000000001
don't know very nice story to the side

7538.32 --> 7542.219
of it that doesn't take away that you

7539.7 --> 7544.62
actually have to figure out how to

7542.219 --> 7548.07
manipulate your independent variable

7544.62 --> 7553.099999999999
which must be the actual thing you're

7548.07 --> 7553.099999999999
trying to prove the cause off so

7553.64 --> 7559.17
variables that's fine yeah but you have

7556.17 --> 7561.62
to manipulate this specific independent

7559.17 --> 7564.0
variable which is easier try to

7561.62 --> 7566.969
otherwise it's not gonna be scientific

7564.0 --> 7573.44
proof I don't don't talk to me don't

7566.969 --> 7576.15
talk over me please oh no it's my show

7573.44 --> 7583.11
don't approach it objectively you have a

7576.15 --> 7585.239
bias it's true yeah you sure complain a

7583.11 --> 7587.19
lot about people talking over you when

7585.239 --> 7590.37
you talk over everybody else r1 yeah

7587.19 --> 7592.5599999999995
anyway if you don't approach it

7590.37 --> 7601.349999999999
objective it's my show if you don't like

7592.56 --> 7604.7390000000005
the way I do it then you assume it to be

7601.35 --> 7606.81
true you have a bias if you don't have

7604.739 --> 7612.509999999999
an assumption that it's true your

7606.81 --> 7615.6
unbiased you look at it objectively the

7612.51 --> 7618.2
opposite actually it seeks to the

7615.6 --> 7622.530000000001
scientific method seeks to falsify a

7618.2 --> 7629.13
prior conclusion right so it's actually

7622.53 --> 7630.989
the opposite no now look the scientific

7629.13 --> 7633.76
method works I'll follow the scientific

7630.989 --> 7635.86
method sets out to prove

7633.76 --> 7639.52
then using the scientific method and

7635.86 --> 7642.46
then because of the nature of it has to

7639.52 --> 7644.68
be actually repeated the exit has to be

7642.46 --> 7646.96
an experiment has to be repeated has to

7644.68 --> 7649.81
be repeatable by others and the option

7646.96 --> 7653.83
left open in order to disprove it

7649.81 --> 7656.4400000000005
scientifically is by allowing others to

7653.83 --> 7660.01
perform the same experiment and if there

7656.44 --> 7663.3099999999995
are different results yielded then there

7660.01 --> 7667.0
is a conflict and it is disproven that's

7663.31 --> 7669.490000000001
the only way by first establishing

7667.0 --> 7671.56
something scientifically using the

7669.49 --> 7673.139999999999
independent variable which must be the

7671.56 --> 7676.150000000001
thing that's going to be proven and

7673.14 --> 7679.3
putting that up for open experimentation

7676.15 --> 7681.82
and then it could be disproven

7679.3 --> 7686.110000000001
technically but first it has to be

7681.82 --> 7687.79
established no yes no I don't have it

7686.11 --> 7688.9
all wrong that's a scientific method

7687.79 --> 7691.18
that you want to prove its the

7688.9 --> 7693.46
scientific method that's where science

7691.18 --> 7695.92
comes from that's where it all comes

7693.46 --> 7699.64
from not the speculation at the cultural

7695.92 --> 7701.92
imitation of science this signs that no

7699.64 --> 7707.05
science actual science the scientific

7701.92 --> 7708.9400000000005
method everybody Arwen Arwen yes or when

7707.05 --> 7711.1
you just you just want a monologue over

7708.94 --> 7713.86
everybody no I want to make a point and

7711.1 --> 7715.900000000001
I want to sink it I want to sink in the

7713.86 --> 7719.469999999999
fundamental point I want to let it sink

7715.9 --> 7722.95
in so you don't bypass it again and make

7719.47 --> 7725.47
up more stories but a clear point was

7722.95 --> 7727.84
made as well by someone like I haven't

7725.47 --> 7730.93
ever been on this panel before and I

7727.84 --> 7737.62
made I know a succinct point I didn't

7730.93 --> 7742.63
feel met you didn't feel what met you

7737.62 --> 7746.26
didn't meet me man-to-man eyeball to

7742.63 --> 7749.47
eyeball throat you know I didn't know if

7746.26 --> 7754.2
you were talking to me well it was clear

7749.47 --> 7759.37
like you know you will have everybody on

7754.2 --> 7761.71
you have a bias oh you're talking about

7759.37 --> 7764.46
the whole biasing well well yeah of

7761.71 --> 7767.539
course I mean the scientific method

7764.46 --> 7774.019
implicitly has no bias to it

7767.539 --> 7776.98
it's a it's a you approach biases

7774.019 --> 7779.4490000000005
opinion based it's it's personal the

7776.98 --> 7781.009999999999
science is a method in the bias has

7779.449 --> 7782.989
nothing to do with it science doesn't

7781.01 --> 7786.889
have an opinion it's not sentient it's a

7782.989 --> 7789.53
method but human beings are subjective

7786.889 --> 7792.4400000000005
creatures they have emotional

7789.53 --> 7796.09
attachments ideas concepts belief

7792.44 --> 7800.36
systems do not underestimate this

7796.09 --> 7803.619000000001
something objectively is an art form in

7800.36 --> 7806.719
itself that is that is certainly a

7803.619 --> 7808.46
factor but just just because that is

7806.719 --> 7810.7390000000005
possible see this is one of the problems

7808.46 --> 7813.559
I see with a lot of people they think

7810.739 --> 7815.989
that just because there can be a wrench

7813.559 --> 7818.6900000000005
thrown in the system that always there's

7815.989 --> 7821.598999999999
a wrench thrown in the system science

7818.69 --> 7824.239
that when when when you have scientists

7821.599 --> 7827.84
that are contributing to scientific

7824.239 --> 7831.348999999999
journals they do their very very best to

7827.84 --> 7832.76
exclude personal bias and all those

7831.349 --> 7835.1900000000005
other things that you mentioned right

7832.76 --> 7837.469
through the through the methodologies

7835.19 --> 7840.44
and what they what they try to do

7837.469 --> 7842.42
especially through peer review is put

7840.44 --> 7845.388999999999
everything that they do through the

7842.42 --> 7848.36
freaking wringer there they actually

7845.389 --> 7851.32
want someone to disprove them they they

7848.36 --> 7853.518999999999
want to show that without a doubt the

7851.32 --> 7856.869
conclusions that they're coming to are

7853.519 --> 7861.289000000001
the proper and true conclusions through

7856.869 --> 7863.0
even through a peer review so so yeah I

7861.289 --> 7864.92
mean all these all these things that

7863.0 --> 7867.349
that everybody's speaking of that it has

7864.92 --> 7869.63
to be unbiased and and you got to watch

7867.349 --> 7871.849
out you know for for your personal

7869.63 --> 7874.01
passions getting into the conclusions

7871.849 --> 7877.9400000000005
who come to of course they're already

7874.01 --> 7880.639
factoring that in with with most there's

7877.94 --> 7884.03
a whole battlefield laid out you get to

7880.639 --> 7885.86
peak you side you get you have argument

7884.03 --> 7890.03
there's websites on how to argue

7885.86 --> 7895.28
flat-earthers well it doesn't have to be

7890.03 --> 7898.789
a battle there's a happy war no I really

7895.28 --> 7900.799
badly it's why I've you know these were

7898.789 --> 7908.119
some of the things I was like

7900.799 --> 7910.099
gee this is interesting with my with my

7908.119 --> 7914.268999999999
with my personal story with the Flat

7910.099 --> 7918.729
Earth I have to because boilers are at

7914.269 --> 7921.499
it all the time I was I was a really

7918.729 --> 7922.76
mercurial kind of guy when I was first

7921.499 --> 7925.188999999999
starting with this though it's kind of

7922.76 --> 7929.019
guy that went on and you know boy your

7925.189 --> 7932.299
sarong and yeah I'm actually much more

7929.019 --> 7934.999
agreeable now and I can i I don't I

7932.299 --> 7937.789
don't attack people you know with with

7934.999 --> 7939.228999999999
very rare exception if they're like

7937.789 --> 7942.1089999999995
trolling me of course I'll troll them

7939.229 --> 7945.469
back but I really very rarely attack

7942.109 --> 7947.749000000001
people because I do understand the

7945.469 --> 7951.559
reasons why now that flat-earthers think

7947.749 --> 7953.389
the way they didn't right but I mean

7951.559 --> 7954.219
when you can't let's go around attacking

7953.389 --> 7957.7390000000005
people

7954.219 --> 7962.2390000000005
now there's of course the the bigger

7957.739 --> 7965.3589999999995
guys like team skeptic and fight the

7962.239 --> 7967.579
Flat Earth and all that they're they're

7965.359 --> 7971.479
in the business of doing that they're in

7967.579 --> 7974.209
the business of ridiculing you guys and

7971.479 --> 7974.479
I'm I'm really not part of that sort of

7974.209 --> 7977.659
thing

7974.479 --> 7979.879
I used to be I'm really not now

7977.659 --> 7982.098999999999
I would I would rather just sit on these

7979.879 --> 7984.789
panels and talk to you like regular

7982.099 --> 7990.969
human beings to other human beings so

7984.789 --> 7994.699
we're not we're not all bad no we really

7990.969 --> 7998.629
mean but yeah I want you to get into so

7994.699 --> 8001.539
like for me the more this is unfolded

7998.629 --> 8005.559
the reason why I step forward is because

8001.539 --> 8010.839
I come from a creative background okay

8005.559 --> 8016.229
and in their creative circles we have

8010.839 --> 8020.26
imagination we have this fantasy ideas

8016.229 --> 8021.4890000000005
concepts that's the realm but when it

8020.26 --> 8025.419
comes to this subject

8021.489 --> 8029.018999999999
it's about objective reality yeah fact

8025.419 --> 8031.179
totally agree you know so that that's

8029.019 --> 8034.6
why it called me because it was like

8031.179 --> 8037.78
well I know I don't need new concept

8034.6 --> 8041.4400000000005
like about ice walls and domes and

8037.78 --> 8044.86
things like this is like no no I I want

8041.44 --> 8048.879999999999
to actually establish for myself and be

8044.86 --> 8052.839999999999
part of a collective that it's our turn

8048.88 --> 8056.35
to open up the books and have reassess

8052.84 --> 8061.03
the data and the information we were

8056.35 --> 8065.68
taught as children as adults over the

8061.03 --> 8070.83
open mind and tackle this honestly as we

8065.68 --> 8074.5
can and what I've found is the globe is

8070.83 --> 8082.48
left squandering in the corner like a

8074.5 --> 8085.56
scared thing it's scared it's terrified

8082.48 --> 8087.549999999999
of question you honestly think that

8085.56 --> 8090.490000000001
definitely that's what being my

8087.55 --> 8093.28
experience it's like don't question me

8090.49 --> 8094.09
just believe in me everything will be

8093.28 --> 8098.32
okay

8094.09 --> 8102.79
the more question me the more I vanish

8098.32 --> 8106.57
that the less a hold I have on your mind

8102.79 --> 8109.96
you will eradicate me you will destroy

8106.57 --> 8110.889999999999
me do not question me because what will

8109.96 --> 8114.46
you be left with

8110.89 --> 8119.59
I actually I sort of disagree with that

8114.46 --> 8122.17
because in my experience the king rather

8119.59 --> 8127.150000000001
than disorganization can't you see going

8122.17 --> 8131.7300000000005
on I've reached I've reached a certain

8127.15 --> 8138.969999999999
level like I could take any baller on

8131.73 --> 8141.37
and destroy them yeah definitely I'd

8138.97 --> 8143.26
like to have I'd like to have a contest

8141.37 --> 8146.89
that and because Nathan does that also

8143.26 --> 8149.59
and the ballers yeah you may touch then

8146.89 --> 8152.160000000001
you may ruffle their feathers but

8149.59 --> 8155.46
actually destroy their conviction which

8152.16 --> 8159.849999999999
lies in the foundation of this behavior

8155.46 --> 8162.64
the religion it's not about that I could

8159.85 --> 8164.9800000000005
destroy their argument you mean they're

8162.64 --> 8165.9890000000005
arguing I could destroy the concepts not

8164.98 --> 8168.419999999999
the person

8165.989 --> 8172.44
not the personality not the ego not the

8168.42 --> 8180.749
side now comes the cop can't already

8172.44 --> 8183.839999999999
straw men eat I'm but you can't really

8180.749 --> 8187.71
destroy a concept because it's not real

8183.84 --> 8190.559
to begin with easy its accounts when you

8187.71 --> 8193.319
have facts and you can back it with

8190.559 --> 8196.859
practical demonstration and get beyond

8193.319 --> 8199.289999999999
the rhetoric and the sophist tree you

8196.859 --> 8203.099
can definitely crush concepts because

8199.29 --> 8205.740000000002
that's all they are no you my higher

8203.099 --> 8205.979
question is this then have you destroyed

8205.74 --> 8207.779
it

8205.979 --> 8209.819
ok so so you would say that you've

8207.779 --> 8212.130000000001
destroyed it to your satisfaction

8209.819 --> 8217.05
have you destroyed it to others

8212.13 --> 8221.33
satisfaction yeah yeah I I know ballers

8217.05 --> 8223.949999999999
I know so called flat-earthers and the

8221.33 --> 8227.219
realization happened for me last year

8223.95 --> 8230.729000000001
after hearing it debated I said that to

8227.219 --> 8233.369999999999
ISA and Jim I said after three or four

8230.729 --> 8235.769
years if a debate could settle this

8233.37 --> 8237.929
wouldn't it be settled by now if I may

8235.769 --> 8243.979
intervene for a moment thank you really

8237.929 --> 8249.51
hold on hold on come on hold on hold on

8243.979 --> 8252.33
hold on hold on please thank you James

8249.51 --> 8255.09
Mays for the $20 super chat donation

8252.33 --> 8258.229
much appreciated he says enjoy it this

8255.09 --> 8261.149
morning catch you later on ball-busters

8258.229 --> 8267.389
thanks thanks for the superjet continue

8261.149 --> 8268.83
please hey yeah when it's des yeah yeah

8267.389 --> 8272.339999999998
I can hear you find out you're you're

8268.83 --> 8274.95
loud great thanks okay no no no I'm fine

8272.34 --> 8278.639000000001
I'll I'll cue in it you just you're loud

8274.95 --> 8280.59
and clear go go right could you get on

8278.639 --> 8282.99
the car yeah my thanks know how the

8280.59 --> 8285.99
question was that you have you have

8282.99 --> 8289.67
convinced yourself of course that to

8285.99 --> 8292.67
your own satisfaction that you destroy

8289.67 --> 8296.42
I haven't I haven't convinced myself

8292.67 --> 8300.32
there's a big difference here that what

8296.42 --> 8303.65
needed to happen was we needed to get

8300.32 --> 8306.94
the practical demonstration and out of

8303.65 --> 8310.341
theoretical theoretical mumbo-jumbo and

8306.94 --> 8312.62
word salad okay what we needed to get

8310.341 --> 8316.551
back to us how to practically

8312.62 --> 8320.660000000002
demonstrate things improve them once and

8316.551 --> 8322.88
for all but with substances you know the

8320.66 --> 8324.95
substances that exist here on the earth

8322.88 --> 8328.279999999999
and then the reality we find ourself in

8324.95 --> 8331.730000000001
and when that process took place the

8328.28 --> 8334.91
globe is left wanting that that's all

8331.73 --> 8337.039999999999
there is to it that's very interesting

8334.91 --> 8339.051
you you say that because I take the

8337.04 --> 8342.230000000001
complete opposite you know when when you

8339.051 --> 8345.68
when you put up Flat Earth concepts to

8342.23 --> 8352.609999999999
the scrutiny of actual observations they

8345.68 --> 8365.86
are the ones that our founding dude yeah

8352.61 --> 8365.86
what flutter I just mentioned something

8369.91 --> 8380.27
and then you didn't hear me dude all

8373.341 --> 8382.58
right so I said the right to dish and

8380.27 --> 8395.061
that is found wanting as well hey Chuck

8382.58 --> 8397.82
let's say no whether it's how could you

8395.061 --> 8400.699999999999
establish time exists for a start let's

8397.82 --> 8403.91
start there how could you prove there's

8400.7 --> 8411.29
a dome that is a very good question I

8403.91 --> 8413.48
don't know I don't ascribe to me I mean

8411.29 --> 8415.160000000002
that this we're already sending we're

8413.48 --> 8416.66
already sending stuff up there and

8415.16 --> 8417.351
they're not hitting the dome so oh

8416.66 --> 8419.391
really

8417.351 --> 8422.939
either are you are you sending things

8419.391 --> 8426.17
out there so chopper

8422.939 --> 8429.630000000001
you think what's up that a chocolate you

8426.17 --> 8434.58
you think that I have to want to join

8429.63 --> 8438.21
the Saturday morning party yeah what's

8434.58 --> 8441.0
your Sandman yeah metal slugs I do think

8438.21 --> 8443.22
you need to do a little bit more and

8441.0 --> 8446.25
something more empirical in order to

8443.22 --> 8449.789999999999
take yeah something like that as

8446.25 --> 8454.29
evidence of yeah the nature of the world

8449.79 --> 8455.79
yes definitely yeah three different

8454.29 --> 8458.130000000001
levels you have three different levels

8455.79 --> 8462.26
of this and I can ask the question I I

8458.13 --> 8462.259999999998
haven't even mentioned anything yet and

8463.76 --> 8468.66
there's an assumed if you're gonna

8466.29 --> 8471.300000000001
assume that yes yes chocolate but first

8468.66 --> 8475.13
if you're gonna assume that things are

8471.3 --> 8477.779999999999
being sent out there beyond yeah

8475.13 --> 8482.64
definitely they are yes now that's what

8477.78 --> 8486.51
you assume that's what you assume I want

8482.64 --> 8488.64
to address something yesterday I want to

8486.51 --> 8495.06
just something that Merle said like

8488.64 --> 8502.83
before I came on and was up tomorrow by

8495.06 --> 8506.34
the way he said something that was

8502.83 --> 8511.14
really good for said you know all this

8506.34 --> 8513.149
time we've been meeting if there was

8511.14 --> 8515.07
gonna be any move for the globe wouldn't

8513.149 --> 8521.25
happen wouldn't have been proven by now

8515.07 --> 8524.029999999999
and I really got this debate is still

8521.25 --> 8531.66
going on and it's not really a debate

8524.03 --> 8537.960000000001
because the globe is scrambling right

8531.66 --> 8540.72
now don't want to hear that from you all

8537.96 --> 8545.399
think I'm stupid saying that but listen

8540.72 --> 8550.529999999999
you guys are scrambling I don't even see

8545.399 --> 8556.16
it think you don't even see you know

8550.53 --> 8559.7
it's funny again what do you mean yeah

8556.16 --> 8561.74
I honestly don't see a difference either

8559.7 --> 8565.220000000001
I don't I don't see a battle or anything

8561.74 --> 8571.85
like that so some people like battle so

8565.22 --> 8574.25
then what are you doing here this topic

8571.85 --> 8589.07
is so ridiculous to you guys I never

8574.25 --> 8592.43
said it was ridiculous that sounds like

8589.07 --> 8594.8
scrambling to me you asking why people

8592.43 --> 8611.09
question it people are looking no I said

8594.8 --> 8613.09
we can't find curvature guys - you're

8611.09 --> 8617.36
crackling with your mic constantly so

thank you for joining Mathias you're

8639.17 --> 8647.6
muted okay Nobby anyway yeah I guess

8645.189 --> 8649.79
this should have been proven by a novice

8647.6 --> 8654.68
don't hat mean it's been by other people

8649.79 --> 8669.490000000002
but you just said it has been before us

8654.68 --> 8671.899
you know 2019 they're still bringing up

8669.49 --> 8674.24
from 2,000 years ago

8671.899 --> 8676.96
yeah because they've got along this unit

8674.24 --> 8676.96

8705.63 --> 8721.67

middle of a conversation why are you

8752.939 --> 8772.83

happens the whole lot I don't whenever

8785.7 --> 8792.42
three minutes please he's just such a

8791.31 --> 8794.069
different person in different

8792.42 --> 8797.210000000001
conversations I've never once threatened

8794.069 --> 8797.21
him and I did help him yesterday

8823.92 --> 8830.3
okay come on maril like oh we're at some

8828.12 --> 8834.84
of us are at the point where we don't

8830.3 --> 8835.58
need the ballers anymore that's it in a

8834.84 --> 8841.5
nutshell

8835.58 --> 8844.11
now you you're either on board or you're

8841.5 --> 8849.12
not if the line has to be drawn like you

8844.11 --> 8852.300000000001
live in your fantasy reality and you

8849.12 --> 8855.42
live on your side of the line and keep

8852.3 --> 8857.22
believing that you live on planet Earth

8855.42 --> 8859.11
and you're in the universe and it's

8857.22 --> 8863.22
spinning around and doing all that stuff

8859.11 --> 8866.880000000001
go ahead but there's a split in the

8863.22 --> 8872.96
human species now and some of us want to

8866.88 --> 8875.73
know answers we want to know answers now

8872.96 --> 8881.100999999999
we want to know where we are with being

8875.73 --> 8883.770999999999
reasonable with being polite only went

8881.101 --> 8885.300000000001
so far and if people don't start

8883.771 --> 8894.0
listening to us

8885.3 --> 8897.96
we'll talk louder okay and then come on

8894.0 --> 8899.46
come on it's almost done please it's

8897.96 --> 8905.520999999999
pretty long though and [ __ ] right no

8899.46 --> 8906.5
come on just yeah Merrill you're making

8905.521 --> 8913.710000000001
good point

8906.5 --> 8915.84
that's it right so was it that hard you

8913.71 --> 8918.3
get the question I asked um chocolate

8915.84 --> 8919.74
though the first question to was what

8918.3 --> 8922.17
did he mean by the Scramble we talked

8919.74 --> 8924.66
about that scramble and then Morel went

8922.17 --> 8926.76
into some people who aren't here and

8924.66 --> 8928.141
some rant about it so I was asking

8926.76 --> 8930.75
specifically about this scramble in this

8928.141 --> 8933.3
battle that's not existent there may be

8930.75 --> 8934.95
a battle between Murrell maybe using

8933.3 --> 8937.59
some specific people but they're not

8934.95 --> 8941.689
here you're here thank you you're here

8937.59 --> 8943.279
I'm not yeah morale whatever

8941.689 --> 8949.459
different person and we have friendly

8943.279 --> 8950.93
conversations yes I am behind a battle

8949.459 --> 8955.51
with you though so it's like every time

8950.93 --> 8958.369
on our war with each other as well

8955.51 --> 8959.569
exotic it's not a battle we we can have

8958.369 --> 8961.399000000001
a friendly conversation

8959.569 --> 8964.788999999999
please don't he doesn't always go down

8961.399 --> 8967.249
like that right I'm not even signal

8964.789 --> 8970.189
everything about you you with me but

8967.249 --> 8972.319
sometimes this [ __ ] is a battle you know

8970.189 --> 8974.119
that and I know that don't play by

8972.319 --> 8975.68
people who are fantasizing about

8974.119 --> 8979.939
battling but you don't have to do that

8975.68 --> 8982.699
you don't to take part in it so why do

8979.939 --> 8985.880000000001
you guys go out of your way and I don't

8982.699 --> 8988.579
mean you particularly but why there's so

8985.88 --> 8990.679999999998
many of you people go out of your way to

8988.579 --> 8994.13
try to make flat-earthers

8990.68 --> 8997.239
look stupid and feel stupid and just try

8994.13 --> 9000.698999999999
to read it ridiculous I don't understand

8997.239 --> 9003.999
I don't see anybody going after the

9000.699 --> 9006.1
people that believe aliens ancient

9003.999 --> 9008.909
aliens has been on [ __ ] TV for the

9006.1 --> 9013.300000000001
past 15 years 20 years I don't know

9008.909 --> 9015.52
nobody's going after them everybody has

9013.3 --> 9017.729
to go after the crazy flat-earthers what

9015.52 --> 9021.489
what's what's the deal this is

9017.729 --> 9027.3
ridiculous this is such a ridiculous

9021.489 --> 9027.3
thing whatever you guys doing not

9027.51 --> 9033.489
absolutely right there are some of us

9029.709 --> 9037.449
don't give two flying [ __ ] about you're

9033.489 --> 9041.288999999999
just fine because the guys can't prove

9037.449 --> 9043.149000000001
it I asked you about that earlier just

9041.289 --> 9045.069000000001
name one thing and I'll show you how you

9043.149 --> 9046.448999999999
can discover it right now and observe it

9045.069 --> 9048.01
for yourself housekeeping question I

9046.449 --> 9049.479000000001
know you said this you said that nobody

9048.01 --> 9051.939
can name anything you've done this

9049.479 --> 9054.788999999999
before we're not going into that well

9051.939 --> 9057.67
then you don't want to find it no no you

9054.789 --> 9059.319000000001
have nothing presented just look you've

9057.67 --> 9061.539
done this on the debates even with

9059.319 --> 9064.868999999999
Nathan and you just waste everyone's

9061.539 --> 9066.67
time and so talking on and on about

9064.869 --> 9068.079
people who aren't here about some war

9066.67 --> 9071.53
you're here that's not wasting time

9068.079 --> 9074.98
you're here I'm giving you

9071.53 --> 9077.471000000001
a war it's not a battle like in it's not

9074.98 --> 9079.42
it's not a physical war but it is a

9077.471 --> 9082.48
psychological you know what is it in

9079.42 --> 9085.33
heaven not that there are people running

9082.48 --> 9087.46
around questioning the [ __ ] that

9085.33 --> 9089.771
we've been told all our life and you

9087.46 --> 9092.41
guys want to shut that down I don't mean

9089.771 --> 9096.91
you particularly the ones on the panel

9092.41 --> 9099.641
I'm talking about in general okay you

9096.91 --> 9102.58
guys have shows on like this [ __ ] non

9099.641 --> 9104.74
sequitur and all this [ __ ] that that

9102.58 --> 9106.57
that are I here trying to do nothing but

9104.74 --> 9112.181
make flatter this looks stupid

9106.57 --> 9116.619999999999
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right

9112.181 --> 9119.17
that's cool for you so I guess I'll talk

9116.62 --> 9122.410000000002
about the second alright why don't you

9119.17 --> 9126.61
go on their shows then and these shows

9122.41 --> 9129.07
like that get only have we literally

9126.61 --> 9137.460000000001
have an [ __ ] running around and calls

9129.07 --> 9137.46
himself right the Flat Earth paper bag

9142.65 --> 9153.94
being like he knows I was under deep

9150.75 --> 9157.811
psychological and emotional attack in

9153.94 --> 9160.57
the discord I was ganged up on things

9157.811 --> 9164.949999999999
are being said about me not about this

9160.57 --> 9168.851
subject about me as a person it was a

9164.95 --> 9170.710000000001
personal attack and I pushed back and I

9168.851 --> 9174.101
said if it was in real life

9170.71 --> 9176.891
it wouldn't be happening and that trust

9174.101 --> 9180.011
and believe not at all and that was I

9176.891 --> 9185.59
don't know right now you know it went

9180.011 --> 9190.42
down and M what do we it is a battle

9185.59 --> 9195.61
zone and we're outnumbered in there when

9190.42 --> 9198.07
they so coach shows being completely

9195.61 --> 9200.94
dishonest right now wait what did I said

9198.07 --> 9203.32
it was dishonest more dishonest

9200.94 --> 9205.300000000001
dishonest was just said there's no

9203.32 --> 9206.77
battle and he just gave you an exam

9205.3 --> 9208.029999999999
boy how said there's no battle if you

9206.77 --> 9211.800000000001
don't want there to be one of course

9208.03 --> 9211.800000000001
people are gonna argue if you don't

9212.31 --> 9217.539999999999
right now there's a war then you won't

9215.8 --> 9219.22
be in a war yeah but there is a war

9217.54 --> 9220.45
that's the point though there is yeah

9219.22 --> 9239.58
there is because there's a lot of

9220.45 --> 9242.68
ballers that do want to be honest and

9239.58 --> 9248.319
that's what an eye open my people picked

9242.68 --> 9254.550000000001
on you I will do that anywhere I open my

9248.319 --> 9258.189
mind and my soul I know that it's thrown

9254.55 --> 9260.8
ya mean people picked on you they'll do

9258.189 --> 9262.18
that on the Internet the people who you

9260.8 --> 9264.91
want to talk to you like Scott Beach for

9262.18 --> 9268.380000000001
example or mean there's other people who

9264.91 --> 9268.38
you can talk to like normal people

9271.149 --> 9278.019999999999
so speech other people have been to but

9274.87 --> 9280.630000000001
not everybody has that's all yeah I'm

9278.02 --> 9283.33
not exaggerating yeah you know what's up

9280.63 --> 9287.13
you know I never said it and that wasn't

9283.33 --> 9289.899
true it's not something [ __ ] really

9287.13 --> 9292.21
I never said people don't pick on people

9289.899 --> 9293.619999999999
people do that globe errs will do it to

9292.21 --> 9300.699999999999
the flat earthers flat earthers to its

9293.62 --> 9301.6
global can I say Sun go can I say

9300.7 --> 9304.6
something though you know what's the

9301.6 --> 9307.06
wack part is that I don't come any in

9304.6 --> 9309.85
into these hangouts and you know I'm not

9307.06 --> 9311.949999999999
trying everybody is a [ __ ] human my

9309.85 --> 9315.069
wall human all trying to live in the

9311.95 --> 9317.470000000001
world together right I don't go out of

9315.069 --> 9320.41
my way to try to find people to insult I

9317.47 --> 9323.59
don't find topics that I disagree with

9320.41 --> 9326.229
and enter their hangout so I can tell

9323.59 --> 9329.14
them about themselves and [ __ ] I mean

9326.229 --> 9332.38
who does things like that but me just a

9329.14 --> 9334.779999999999
regular person I've grown up in a world

9332.38 --> 9338.8
where I was told I was [ __ ] spitting

9334.78 --> 9340.899000000001
on a ball and I get to a point where

9338.8 --> 9342.938999999998
I start questioning that and then that

9340.899 --> 9345.31
becomes a problem for other people when

9342.939 --> 9346.899
you ask those very same people do you

9345.31 --> 9350.14
feel like you're spinning and their

9346.899 --> 9351.16
answer is no but I'm made to look crazy

9350.14 --> 9355.779999999999
[ __ ]

9351.16 --> 9357.819
that those people aren't here what you

9355.78 --> 9361.87
guys are venting but no one's on this

9357.819 --> 9364.029999999999
little Channel right now doing that I'm

9361.87 --> 9373.569000000001
sorry about the cursing Harlan no I know

9364.03 --> 9378.49
you're not this is why I'm always the

9373.569 --> 9381.88
same lose my [ __ ] it's nothing wrong

9378.49 --> 9386.14
with getting frustrated sometimes I in

9381.88 --> 9389.89
my everyday life I'm very calm I enjoy

9386.14 --> 9393.16
being alive it all depends who I

9389.89 --> 9398.92
encounter and what I encounter while I

9393.16 --> 9401.979
mean and that was that was my point but

9398.92 --> 9404.729
I can get like see I can have a good

9401.979 --> 9407.59
back-and-forth with me or with Kosho a

9404.729 --> 9409.688999999998
somebody like kosher or other other

9407.59 --> 9411.37
different Global's that I met that I can

9409.689 --> 9413.14
get along with you can say what

9411.37 --> 9414.67
something keep it moving even though we

9413.14 --> 9417.13
might call each other a you should be

9414.67 --> 9418.84
globey your you know flatting whatever I

9417.13 --> 9420.759999999998
don't care about that but when it gets

9418.84 --> 9424.18
serious to a point where it's like you

9420.76 --> 9426.76
guys want to docs people and warn bomb

9424.18 --> 9429.37
and snipe and do all the dismal sense

9426.76 --> 9431.53
that you do and then when we try to have

9429.37 --> 9435.04
decent conversations with you you guys

9431.53 --> 9437.800000000001
don't concede to [ __ ] and it's

9435.04 --> 9440.229000000001
frustrating to listen to you guys and

9437.8 --> 9442.39
you don't concede to [ __ ] when most flat

9440.229 --> 9444.81
earthers will say if we don't know

9442.39 --> 9451.569
something we don't [ __ ] know okay

9444.81 --> 9453.67
that's that's I can't attest to that I

9451.569 --> 9455.59
can attest to that part oh okay

9453.67 --> 9457.75
chocolate draft for a moment he's

9455.59 --> 9463.93
probably moderators do all those

9457.75 --> 9466.24
negative traits as well we don't have

9463.93 --> 9469.18
different properties from hold on the

9466.24 --> 9471.92
people will generally deal with and

9469.18 --> 9474.14
don't do that the flat-earthers boys in

9471.92 --> 9476.45
flat-earthers we generally deal with

9474.14 --> 9479.24
don't do that and when they do we

9476.45 --> 9480.800000000001
address them like stop it you really

9479.24 --> 9482.09
have it don't listen you guys are not

9480.8 --> 9483.56
different you guys were born from your

9482.09 --> 9485.0
mother's just like we were you people

9483.56 --> 9487.1
have people make mistakes people are

9485.0 --> 9489.32
bullies on both sides it's not like you

9487.1 --> 9492.470000000001
guys have some properties that's yeah

9489.32 --> 9494.9
but we actually actively stop seed some

9492.47 --> 9498.38
people or root it upon me activist I

9494.9 --> 9499.97
stopped from top-down everybody this

9498.38 --> 9503.17
kind of successful that's getting

9499.97 --> 9505.729
attention is actively stopping that and

9503.17 --> 9507.95
we don't really see that in the baller

9505.729 --> 9509.57
activity on this court or even with the

9507.95 --> 9512.150000000001
problem in players with their big

9509.57 --> 9514.369999999999
channels nobody actually discouraged is

9512.15 --> 9516.74
that everybody actually just fallen does

9514.37 --> 9519.650000000001
it like they're proud of like oh I was

9516.74 --> 9521.78
so nasty at him haha oh my god no you

9519.65 --> 9524.51
don't have that concept you don't have

9521.78 --> 9527.93
that principle in your group mentality

9524.51 --> 9531.800000000001
we flat earthers what we've been doing

9527.93 --> 9532.58
we do we do criticize our own for their

9531.8 --> 9544.279999999999
bad behavior

9532.58 --> 9548.47
Arwen 24/7 no no I don't go to this

9544.28 --> 9550.820000000002
court ever cause it's an well then it's

9548.47 --> 9554.779999999999
called up for the national his places

9643.3 --> 9649.958999999999
cursed at I went in there I I wanted to

9646.84 --> 9653.77
I went to the sorry I went into the 24/7

9649.959 --> 9657.579000000002
flatter chat and I was civil as hell on

9653.77 --> 9665.289
in the lobby there and I was how simple

9657.579 --> 9668.199
is helpful over I was I was I was simply

9665.289 --> 9670.720000000001
saying stuff about the globe earth then

9668.199 --> 9681.369
and one of the mods they they kicked me

9670.72 --> 9683.769999999999
within like story for you but there are

9681.369 --> 9685.390000000001
many there are many other Global's that

9683.77 --> 9689.109
have gotten through and have been able

9685.39 --> 9689.59
to voice chat and do all mean okay I'm

9689.109 --> 9691.630000000001
sorry

9689.59 --> 9694.779
there's also controlled opposition doubt

9691.63 --> 9697.419
I don't know my first time over there

9694.779 --> 9703.51
couldn't help call everybody dicks I had

9697.419 --> 9705.189
to say sorry you guys were there 20 24/7

9703.51 --> 9706.869
player discord it really is the most

9705.189 --> 9710.800000000001
toxic discord of every strolled

9706.869 --> 9725.800000000001
opposition's well by who is who is

9710.8 --> 9729.31
controlling it you got a deal with

9725.8 --> 9731.47
people named fight Flat Earth yeah 24/7

9729.31 --> 9734.399
discourse control officer price and

9731.47 --> 9734.399
someone trying

9736.8 --> 9741.929999999998
if ball earth is want to stop flutters

9738.96 --> 9746.038999999999
and spreading then you just need to be

9741.93 --> 9749.550000000001
quiet because get on with your life you

9746.039 --> 9751.800000000001
just yeah I really think if there was no

9749.55 --> 9755.188999999998
ballers that flat earth wouldn't have it

9751.8 --> 9756.899
would have gone away because I looked at

9755.189 --> 9760.079
photos and thought this is crazy

9756.899 --> 9762.868999999999
but it was the polls that convinced me

9760.079 --> 9772.17
that the earth was flat not flat

9762.869 --> 9774.42
earthers agree with that

9772.17 --> 9776.789
if the ballers wouldn't be so ridiculous

9774.42 --> 9780.0
in their argumentation then I would have

9776.789 --> 9783.060000000001
not paid attention as well it is really

9780.0 --> 9785.67
very strong method mass majority of the

9783.06 --> 9787.859
world's population believes in now the

9785.67 --> 9792.239
fast majority doesn't really think about

9787.859 --> 9795.890000000001
it and barely cares belief is the big

9792.239 --> 9799.618999999999
word that he used as well notice believe

9795.89 --> 9802.13
is where it's at now the sumption is

9799.619 --> 9805.050000000001
where it's at most people's just heard

9802.13 --> 9807.06
most people just heard oh yeah it's

9805.05 --> 9808.948999999999
supposed to be a globe right they don't

9807.06 --> 9813.118999999999
really care you know do you know what do

9808.949 --> 9816.0
you know what knowledge is knowledge is

9813.119 --> 9820.369
justified true belief knowledge is a

9816.0 --> 9824.159
subset of belief no only knowledge is

9820.369 --> 9827.720000000001
conferment not justified belief that's

9824.159 --> 9829.079
that's ideology okay knowledge is

9827.72 --> 9835.409
confirmed

9829.079 --> 9840.689
things that's not not just ideology is a

9835.409 --> 9842.67
confirmed thing a theory is a theory

9840.689 --> 9845.81
until you have a practical understanding

9842.67 --> 9847.859
of it and how do I know instead

9845.81 --> 9850.319
Arwen I know you said you didn't like

9847.859 --> 9852.390000000001
books but you should pick up a book on

9850.319 --> 9856.019999999999
the philosophy of information theory and

9852.39 --> 9859.349999999999
the philosophy of knowledge because it

9856.02 --> 9863.1
is very true that knowledge of the sub's

9859.35 --> 9866.01
belief and it's called justified or you

9863.1 --> 9868.380000000001
can call it reliably true belief because

9866.01 --> 9870.01
the problem here is i know metal slugs

9868.38 --> 9875.229
you know anything

9870.01 --> 9877.210000000001
for sure hundred-percent fact well

9875.229 --> 9880.479
surety doesn't have anything to do with

9877.21 --> 9884.649
facts or knowledge actually it's a yes

9880.479 --> 9887.849999999999
or a no question what did you say do you

9884.649 --> 9891.909
know anything for sure a hundred percent

9887.85 --> 9895.119
fact sure sure I have my acknowledge yes

9891.909 --> 9897.85
like what I got five fingers on my right

9895.119 --> 9900.85
hands okay good that's a great place to

9897.85 --> 9903.819
start say that's annoying isn't it

9900.85 --> 9907.18
that's that's backed up by empirical

9903.819 --> 9910.479
evidence yes it's a justified true

9907.18 --> 9912.67
belief well it's also a reliably true

9910.479 --> 9916.3
belief because I can pick things up yeah

9912.67 --> 9919.779
but why because it has been confirmed

9916.3 --> 9921.849999999999
that look that's what makes it knowledge

9919.779 --> 9924.579
no I don't have to go no but you keep on

9921.85 --> 9928.319
amplifying justifiable belief it's about

9924.579 --> 9931.84
the confirmation knowledge is confirmed

9928.319 --> 9933.999
well yes I can confirm confirmed

9931.84 --> 9937.09
knowledge is what you could consider a

9933.999 --> 9940.26
fact yes that's right it has nothing to

9937.09 --> 9943.84
do with justified belief a belief or

9940.26 --> 9946.6
however you deem it justified well or

9943.84 --> 9949.42
good or sensible is a belief it's

9946.6 --> 9951.43
something to guide you into a discovery

9949.42 --> 9953.89
process that's what it's intended for

9951.43 --> 9956.26
originally to actually figure out how

9953.89 --> 9959.819
something works and then see if your

9956.26 --> 9964.210000000001
belief was indeed on the right path

9959.819 --> 9967.269999999999
yielding a confirmable thing that's

9964.21 --> 9969.399
really for so therefore but until it's

9967.27 --> 9971.68
gone therefore it's a belief it's always

9969.399 --> 9975.269999999999
justified but some of them are correct

9971.68 --> 9978.069
if they have been confirmed yes

9975.27 --> 9980.409
empirically so yeah the problem the

9978.069 --> 9984.038999999999
problem here is the problem here is that

9980.409 --> 9985.84
there is a usage of knowledge and belief

9984.039 --> 9989.949
in common vernacular that a lot of

9985.84 --> 9992.56
people use yeah usually usually people

9989.949 --> 9995.949
use those terms in a in a very

9992.56 --> 10000.479
colloquial way they will say I believe

9995.949 --> 10002.999
this and usually when they say that it

10000.479 --> 10003.51
is an unjustified belief because they

10002.999 --> 10005.521
have

10003.51 --> 10008.7
figured it out yet they haven't returned

10005.521 --> 10011.69
it yes the philosophical usages of these

10008.7 --> 10015.45
terms is a little bit different right

10011.69 --> 10018.230000000001
and that's that's one problem that I do

10015.45 --> 10020.91
see I see I see all the time with people

10018.23 --> 10024.48
where they they say well I know the

10020.91 --> 10028.23
earth is I know I know it's really not

10024.48 --> 10034.65
know it's backed up by empirical

10028.23 --> 10038.279999999999
deduction based evidence it's empirical

10034.65 --> 10040.699999999999
it's actually based on real observations

10038.28 --> 10044.101
and comparing them then deducing

10040.7 --> 10046.86
possibilities geometry all these things

10044.101 --> 10056.431
and you can deduce definitely

10046.86 --> 10057.95
empirically that the earth is flat no

10056.431 --> 10061.92
there isn't just a purely theoretical

10057.95 --> 10064.980000000001
conceptual deduction where you finish

10061.92 --> 10067.55
are you right so there is fear a purely

10064.98 --> 10071.55
theoretical a theory you could call it

10067.55 --> 10074.189999999999
deduction where you just yeah compare

10071.55 --> 10077.189999999999
statistical data try to find a pattern

10074.19 --> 10079.2
in it somehow and then you can say oh

10077.19 --> 10082.561
look it it works according to this

10079.2 --> 10084.181
pattern then you just did use it from

10082.561 --> 10085.8
information but it's not really

10084.181 --> 10089.79
empirical because it hasn't actually

10085.8 --> 10092.88
been test it physically you just drew it

10089.79 --> 10096.230000000001
from data now if you then go and out and

10092.88 --> 10100.08
test it and actually see if you can yeah

10096.23 --> 10102.180999999999
find it for real if you can confirm then

10100.08 --> 10104.851
it keeps on that the part of the pattern

10102.181 --> 10107.67
keeps on working then you have more

10104.851 --> 10108.931
closer you have empirical deduction

10107.67 --> 10110.79
based evidence but if you want to

10108.931 --> 10111.57
scientifically prove it which is the

10110.79 --> 10115.580000000002
bottom line

10111.57 --> 10118.891
then you have to actually yeah very an

10115.58 --> 10123.12
independent variable of the pursuit

10118.891 --> 10125.641
cause of your empirical deduction which

10123.12 --> 10127.92
started out with just checking data and

10125.641 --> 10130.92
comparing patterns and those are

10127.92 --> 10133.86
basically the three steps that I can

10130.92 --> 10136.34
conceive of in how proof works you have

10133.86 --> 10139.04
purely theoretical concepts

10136.34 --> 10142.729
Rico's adduction and you have scientific

10139.04 --> 10144.5
proof in those are no such thing as a

10142.729 --> 10148.688999999998
radical deduction either do you know

10144.5 --> 10152.93
what deduction is yeah okay what is it

10148.689 --> 10156.35
it's taking a swath of data and then

10152.93 --> 10159.409
finding certain patterns in it and then

10156.35 --> 10161.42
you take yeah you take away the rest of

10159.409 --> 10164.09
the data and you focus on those patterns

10161.42 --> 10167.6
and that is a deduction it's a pattern

10164.09 --> 10175.880000000001
but usually deductions are patterns lend

10167.6 --> 10178.52
from innovation yes duction is modus

10175.88 --> 10180.56
ponens logic where the premises are not

10178.52 --> 10183.5
only valid but they are sound that's all

10180.56 --> 10185.84
it is that's all it is it's logic well

10183.5 --> 10189.35
it is in statistical information you

10185.84 --> 10192.8
sound isn't that sound what is what you

10189.35 --> 10196.25
might describe what you described before

10192.8 --> 10198.229
was induction not deduction that's

10196.25 --> 10200.54
that's looking at things observing

10198.229 --> 10201.979
things making sure they line up in

10200.54 --> 10203.899000000001
certain ways and then you make a

10201.979 --> 10207.769999999999
conclusion about it that's an induction

10203.899 --> 10209.96
it is not deduction the only deductive

10207.77 --> 10215.869
proof you really have in real life it

10209.96 --> 10217.669999999998
could be a mathematics okay so no but it

10215.869 --> 10224.890000000001
is a crime that's what it is

10217.67 --> 10224.89
Oracle deduction yeah there is

10225.43 --> 10231.399
referencing your your deductions with

10228.55 --> 10235.039999999999
empiricism with in the real world

10231.399 --> 10237.489
comparing it and testing it that's

10235.04 --> 10239.93
empirical that makes it Imperial er I

10237.489 --> 10252.14
don't think we can go further with this

10239.93 --> 10256.79
because you sure if you can find a some

10252.14 --> 10258.829
kind of say some kind of dictionary or

10256.79 --> 10260.84
whatever that can prove me wrong into my

10258.829 --> 10263.18
assertions then please demonstrate it

10260.84 --> 10266.119
because so far I'm pretty sure off my

10263.18 --> 10269.42
case that up to you oh okay okay so

10266.119 --> 10270.279
you're just assuming that I'm wrong but

10269.42 --> 10273.409
you can't actually

10270.279 --> 10274.880000000001
no no I'm saying it's it's just useless

10273.409 --> 10276.829
to talk about this anymore with you

10274.88 --> 10279.05
because you you're not familiar with any

10276.829 --> 10282.89
of the philosophical right so enlighten

10279.05 --> 10285.948999999999
me then and like me where I'm wrong yeah

10282.89 --> 10288.67
I already did I told you adduction is

10285.949 --> 10291.079
essentially a modus ponens logical

10288.67 --> 10294.8
deduction it's a logical argument you

10291.079 --> 10296.21
say P therefore Q because all of the

10294.8 --> 10298.46
premises of the argument

10296.21 --> 10301.759999999998
line up they're both valid and they are

10298.46 --> 10303.019999999999
sound the the only yeah but what but

10301.76 --> 10304.699
what is sound

10303.02 --> 10307.279
what about it is sound it's the

10304.699 --> 10311.329
information they landed from the real

10307.279 --> 10314.42
world it's the information that's from

10311.329 --> 10316.279
the real world dude Arwen you wanted to

10314.42 --> 10319.939
you wanted me to explain this and you're

10316.279 --> 10321.890000000001
just talking over you ready I'm just

10319.939 --> 10324.35
filling you in with the gaps here and

10321.89 --> 10327.849999999999
there that's all I'm trying to fill you

10324.35 --> 10327.85
in but you're not letting me fill you

10329.02 --> 10337.249
don't mean you know where this globe is

10331.46 --> 10338.989
I mean you have where's the globe just

10337.249 --> 10343.189
let him red herring you just talking

10338.989 --> 10344.899
green circles this is nonsense so yeah

10343.189 --> 10347.479000000001
where am I wrong where is it they're not

10344.899 --> 10350.118999999999
an empirical deduction to actually have

10347.479 --> 10352.489
observations in the real world and then

10350.119 --> 10355.399000000001
find a pattern in that and that pattern

10352.489 --> 10360.279
is a deduction based piece of reasoning

10355.399 --> 10360.278999999999
based on the empirical observations

10372.909 --> 10377.569
that's why it's a two-piece thing it's

10375.59 --> 10380.359
not just a deduction it's not just

10377.569 --> 10383.81
empirical it's empirical the

10380.359 --> 10386.479000000001
observations deduction the conclusions

10383.81 --> 10390.019999999999
based on those observations based on the

10386.479 --> 10392.239
data of that are those observations so I

10390.02 --> 10394.34
don't see the problem you're being the

10392.239 --> 10396.198999999999
brass tacks just going back to brass

10394.34 --> 10397.909
tacks the reason why this came up is

10396.199 --> 10401.720000000001
because we have disagreements on what

10397.909 --> 10403.471
knowing is and what believe now yes

10401.72 --> 10406.32
no you say

10403.471 --> 10409.711
that knowing deals with deductive

10406.32 --> 10411.181
arguments that's not it no no no that's

10409.711 --> 10417.451
what you bring in no it deals with

10411.181 --> 10420.331
confirmation confirmation you're

10417.451 --> 10422.971
bringing your mixing subjects here okay

10420.331 --> 10425.07
you're mixing you're mixing my responses

10422.971 --> 10425.881
in these two subjects it's not what I

10425.07 --> 10428.251
said at all

10425.881 --> 10432.029999999999
what I said what makes knowing different

10428.251 --> 10435.751
from believing is evidence is actual

10432.03 --> 10439.61
confirmation so don't don't mix up the

10435.751 --> 10442.791000000001
subject be called justified true belief

10439.61 --> 10446.551000000001
you can give it whatever

10442.791 --> 10449.279999999999
Tamwar or call her you like what

10446.551 --> 10451.859999999999
actually is the technical foundation is

10449.28 --> 10454.561000000002
the confirmation and you can call it

10451.86 --> 10456.061
whatever type of belief you like okay if

10454.561 --> 10460.201
you want to call it a belief that's fine

10456.061 --> 10462.779999999999
but it rests on the confirmation that's

10460.201 --> 10469.260999999999
what makes it notice the confirmation is

10462.78 --> 10471.570000000002
only for arguments if you want if you

10469.261 --> 10473.701000000001
want pragmatic ontological arguments

10471.57 --> 10477.48
that you can say are true basically

10473.701 --> 10480.871
things that you can assign real evidence

10477.48 --> 10483.600999999999
to actually empirical evidence too then

10480.871 --> 10485.609999999999
yes but there are arguments where you

10483.601 --> 10487.351
don't have empirical evidence now now

10485.61 --> 10490.351
granted flat earth isn't one of those

10487.351 --> 10493.201000000001
latter does have empirical evidence to

10490.351 --> 10495.150000000001
be used in arguments or actually hello

10493.201 --> 10498.24
birds right clovers versus flatter that

10495.15 --> 10500.73
is empirical evidence it's a shape of a

10498.24 --> 10504.001
freaking physical thing and you can see

10500.73 --> 10510.779999999999
signs of that physical thing even if

10504.001 --> 10514.621000000001
you're on the surface of the earth it's

10510.78 --> 10517.591
not it's not it doesn't matter deduction

10514.621 --> 10520.590999999999
induction whatever the whole reason we

10517.591 --> 10526.471
got into thanks thanks for sharing that

10520.591 --> 10529.23
I know it didn't display Marley we

10526.471 --> 10532.74
simply got into a rabbit hole well what

10529.23 --> 10534.761
that all I'm saying is you can have a

10532.74 --> 10538.789999999999
miracle

10534.761 --> 10540.921
bring it out good please show it yeah we

10538.79 --> 10544.37
always hear that this evidence but it's

10540.921 --> 10546.29
never presented the the shape of the

10544.37 --> 10549.650000000001
earth is out falls outside of the

10546.29 --> 10552.410000000002
scientific method so we don't have any

10549.65 --> 10553.881
scientific having critical evidence of

10552.41 --> 10555.891
the shape of it but he's not claiming

10553.881 --> 10558.23
saying I think evidence no he's just

10555.891 --> 10561.770999999999
claiming empirical evidence so bring on

10558.23 --> 10564.109999999999
that evidence scientific Givens now as I

10561.771 --> 10572.891000000001
understood it okay well I try to make a

10564.11 --> 10578.03
distinct difference what's the cause of

10572.891 --> 10580.520999999999
curvature yeah account area manipulate

10578.03 --> 10584.301000000001
the cause of curvature so it falls

10580.521 --> 10587.301000000001
outside science right okay sayang sayang

10584.301 --> 10591.350999999999
sayang manipulating the cause of a shape

10587.301 --> 10594.71
of something is like saying let's let's

10591.351 --> 10596.811
change the cause that makes a lego a

10594.71 --> 10598.520999999999
rectangle that's right seems kind of

10596.811 --> 10602.539999999999
pointless doesn't seems kind of

10598.521 --> 10605.061000000002
pointless doesn't it metal slugs yeah

10602.54 --> 10608.381000000001
that's right so why would you try and

10605.061 --> 10611.869999999999
yeah yeah gonna have to concede there is

10608.381 --> 10613.73
oh well that's nice for you that's nice

10611.87 --> 10615.83
for you but that's how it works that's

10613.73 --> 10618.5
how the scientific method works and you

10615.83 --> 10621.039999999999
can't really prove a geometrical shape

10618.5 --> 10630.681
off the ground you're standing on

10621.04 --> 10632.45
scientifically because you can't no no

10630.681 --> 10639.980000000001
you don't well you don't hate you don't

10632.45 --> 10644.271
have to I mean that's very me plate the

10639.98 --> 10647.511
cause of the effect let's a queue which

10644.271 --> 10653.181
is why this you like other things then

10647.511 --> 10656.15
right because you have to change the

10653.181 --> 10659.181
cause that makes a Lego a rectangle in

10656.15 --> 10663.141
order to know that it's a rectangle no

10659.181 --> 10664.851
you don't need science to figure out if

10663.141 --> 10667.46
something is a rectangle or not it's

10664.851 --> 10670.25
obviously a rectangle so again

10667.46 --> 10672.259999999998
obviously we don't need that no we we

10670.25 --> 10674.12
don't need to change the cause of the

10672.26 --> 10677.15
rectangle to know what the rectangular

10674.12 --> 10682.7
Lego similarly we don't need to know the

10677.15 --> 10685.13
cause of it this should just be obvious

10682.7 --> 10690.35
that we're living on a spinning ball and

10685.13 --> 10692.3
it's not you're making a good point

10690.35 --> 10694.99
you're making a very good point metal

10692.3 --> 10699.32
slugs there's a little problem however

10694.99 --> 10703.18
in society it is generally accepted to

10699.32 --> 10710.84
claim that the earth being a sphere is

10703.18 --> 10713.57
scientifically proven oh right so you

10710.84 --> 10715.55
just conceded you can't actually

10713.57 --> 10718.1
scientifically prove it there's other

10715.55 --> 10720.439999999999
ways to do it yeah you did you literally

10718.1 --> 10722.93
did that just you confirmed what we said

10720.44 --> 10725.720000000001
you can't change the independent

10722.93 --> 10727.79
variable of the earth shape so you can't

10725.72 --> 10730.16
prove it specifically you have to do it

10727.79 --> 10734.92
other ways empirically and throw

10730.16 --> 10738.229
geometrical deduction but yet in in

10734.92 --> 10742.58
science in the scientific community in

10738.229 --> 10745.189999999999
the culture it is claimed that you don't

10742.58 --> 10748.01
need scientifically to be a globe can

10745.19 --> 10750.5
you stop talking through me or I'm gonna

10748.01 --> 10753.14
kick you the thing is stop talking

10750.5 --> 10760.3
saying stop talking saying things and

10753.14 --> 10760.3
then you I am correcting it's all I do

10769.93 --> 10775.43
can't very a manipulator

10773.06 --> 10778.1
the shape of the earth so you can

10775.43 --> 10782.45
scientifically prove it as he conceded

10778.1 --> 10784.880000000001
very clearly several steps conceded to

10782.45 --> 10786.41
that and was very good was correct you

10784.88 --> 10789.439999999999
have to deal with the shape of the earth

10786.41 --> 10793.25
in another way than science yet in the

10789.44 --> 10795.710000000001
scientific community it is being claimed

10793.25 --> 10798.44
that the shape of the Earth has been

10795.71 --> 10802.14
proven scientifically and that it is a

10798.44 --> 10804.76
globe and that's the point we make

10802.14 --> 10810.358999999999
that's all you didn't have to talk over

10804.76 --> 10810.359
me like that now you got yourself you

10812.579 --> 10817.149
know please

10814.18 --> 10820.14
hey it's like an example with non

10817.149 --> 10824.198999999999
analogous because we know the cause of

10820.14 --> 10826.329
valachia created the rectangular may go

10824.199 --> 10829.209
we know that force fact that Leo didn't

10826.329 --> 10830.859
create it so science we just need logic

10829.209 --> 10833.439
and reason and understanding about how

10830.859 --> 10834.939
things are made to know that we don't

10833.439 --> 10836.529
have that same privilege with the earth

10834.939 --> 10839.079
we weren't here when the earth was

10836.529 --> 10841.329
either created or co-created by creator

10839.079 --> 10849.579
were created by the universe right so

10841.329 --> 10860.13
that that's a non analogous what's up

10849.579 --> 10864.909
Chris 1:3 our strong guys you know I

10860.13 --> 10867.909
know what I notice about this with us if

10864.909 --> 10868.739
there isn't us that we're all cool with

10867.909 --> 10871.689
this

10868.739 --> 10877.109
maybe not cool maybe that's the wrong

10871.689 --> 10881.35
word but I know in me I feel an ease now

10877.109 --> 10887.979000000001
something easier it has been lifted big

10881.35 --> 10890.380000000001
burdens being lifted agreed yep okay

10887.979 --> 10894.22
knowing the truth and they don't like

10890.38 --> 10896.8
that they don't like that some of us are

10894.22 --> 10900.579
really just like haha you guys really

10896.8 --> 10903.099999999999
have nothing so you keep rambling

10900.579 --> 10905.8
we're not scrambling to try to prove the

10903.1 --> 10908.949
Flat Earth you guys are really

10905.8 --> 10912.249
scrambling to prove your globe and again

10908.949 --> 10915.67
you might not like it sounds stupid I

10912.249 --> 10918.819
know it might take a while Fionna but

10915.67 --> 10920.68
it's happening happening all around and

10918.819 --> 10922.749
you think it's just on YouTube it's not

10920.68 --> 10925.06
just on YouTube trust me I talk to

10922.749 --> 10929.079
people okay it's not just on YouTube

10925.06 --> 10932.948999999999
it's out there yep and it's all like a

10929.079 --> 10936.25
bigger and bigger so

10932.949 --> 10937.93
in one way or the other no it's very

10936.25 --> 10941.229
rare that you're gonna walk up to

10937.93 --> 10944.29
somebody say Flat Earth to them and

10941.229 --> 10945.97
they're gonna be like what what are you

10944.29 --> 10948.79
saying Flat Earth I've never heard of

10945.97 --> 10951.22
last time I heard anything anyone

10948.79 --> 10952.899000000001
mentioned that was in kindergarten no

10951.22 --> 10956.679999999998
you're never gonna find anyone of those

10952.899 --> 10959.56
everybody will have somehow heard of

10956.68 --> 10962.050000000001
Flat Earth in recent times everyone you

10959.56 --> 10965.8
have fine we had like super worried

10962.05 --> 10968.198999999999
about indoctrination my supervisor just

10965.8 --> 10970.659
came up to me yesterday and told me you

10968.199 --> 10972.43

that's good and you told me that because

10979.18 --> 10985.149
he knows I I you know I go on to debate

10982.42 --> 10987.13
channel I debate at work so he knows

10985.149 --> 10989.8
that I'm into it and I ain't volkens

10987.13 --> 10992.289999999999
everybody at my job like everybody on my

10989.8 --> 10997.17
table knows I'm flattered don't hide it

10992.29 --> 10999.939
you'll see fostered about it uh-huh

10997.17 --> 11001.949
that's really cool your supervisor must

10999.939 --> 11013.83
be really cool to let you count debate

11001.949 --> 11016.949
show yeah he's good I got a lot of cool

11013.83 --> 11018.81
people that I've had people turn on to

11016.949 --> 11022.050000000001
YouTube and listen to it while I'm at

11018.81 --> 11024.028999999999
work because they go yeah the bill

11022.05 --> 11027.509999999998
panels think I'm sitting there listening

11024.029 --> 11028.949
to music and all of a sudden now you

11027.51 --> 11031.050000000001
know hit the mute button and start

11028.949 --> 11034.5
arguing with somebody about gravity or

11031.05 --> 11037.349999999999
something at gas pressure and then and

11034.5 --> 11040.47
then later on somebody like a dude came

11037.35 --> 11042.689
up to him he was like I don't get me

11040.47 --> 11045.269999999999
wrong but I've gotta ask like what the

11042.689 --> 11047.189
hell were you talking to before like I

11045.27 --> 11048.960000000001
thought you were listening to music and

11047.189 --> 11057.449
all of a sudden you start yelling at

11048.96 --> 11059.97
somebody about gravity who you talking

11057.449 --> 11062.01
to you know obviously had to tell him

11059.97 --> 11065.399
you know I don't believe I live on a

11062.01 --> 11066.58
spinning ball anymore and I you know

11065.399 --> 11070.269999999999
pretty much just

11066.58 --> 11073.479
flat smacking right there and in three

11070.27 --> 11077.34
days you had he was he was just like now

11073.479 --> 11080.858999999999
I don't the ball is just ridiculous

11077.34 --> 11083.74
Heath and he's flat smacked his wife and

11080.859 --> 11085.899000000001
now his wife is this little big like he

11083.74 --> 11089.85
told me they're literally running around

11085.899 --> 11092.59
the world right now or their world and

11089.85 --> 11094.75
looking at everything differently and

11092.59 --> 11097.06
saying wow you know this makes so much

11094.75 --> 11100.84
more sense this makes so much more sense

11097.06 --> 11102.49
and that just not sense anything told me

11100.84 --> 11109.380000000001
is like his wife is just like this [ __ ]

11102.49 --> 11112.689
is flat expanding your line and not

11109.38 --> 11114.64
different I'm being doctor nation's

11112.689 --> 11117.03
right you don't take things for granted

11114.64 --> 11121.269999999999
by default anymore

11117.03 --> 11124.060000000001
exactly that's right and since I started

11121.27 --> 11125.710000000001
at this job like it's it's been a

11124.06 --> 11128.47
beautiful thing just talking to people

11125.71 --> 11130.509999999998
and getting it out there and when I

11128.47 --> 11131.89
realized that people I have already I

11130.51 --> 11135.16
mean there were people already know

11131.89 --> 11137.71
about the FE core laser test that had

11135.16 --> 11139.24
been done and I mean somebody brought it

11137.71 --> 11142.029999999999
up to me and I'm looking at him like

11139.24 --> 11145.35
what the hell what do you know about

11142.03 --> 11149.890000000001
healthy board all of that you know so

11145.35 --> 11152.35
yeah just to get back it's yeah sure

11149.89 --> 11153.729
there's millions and millions more

11152.35 --> 11156.76
people who believe they live on a

11153.729 --> 11159.699999999999
spinning ball problem is it's not

11156.76 --> 11165.03
feasible to start thinking about this

11159.7 --> 11165.03
[ __ ] it's gonna it's gonna hit a point

11169.87 --> 11181.271
so yeah no echoing we're about now

11175.87 --> 11184.601
better better yeah so that's that's what

11181.271 --> 11190.091
I want so it's a job it's not going away

11184.601 --> 11192.461000000001
I don't think any time soon and we've

11190.091 --> 11194.171
already had examples of people like Neil

11192.461 --> 11197.58
deGrasse Tyson who say I won't I won't

11194.171 --> 11200.171
debate flat-earthers my question is why

11197.58 --> 11204.641
why that guy supposed to be one of the

11200.171 --> 11207.311
smartest people on this planet right so

11204.641 --> 11210.311
why would he not just come out here shut

11207.311 --> 11212.501
this down and have a good day

11210.311 --> 11216.270999999999
does he really think this little

11212.501 --> 11217.841
microphone drop was was the coup de Gras

11216.271 --> 11221.980000000001
I'm sorry

11217.841 --> 11225.041000000001
could a grass Tyson who the crap it was

11221.98 --> 11227.32
the coup de grâce sorry is stupid

11225.041 --> 11230.520999999999
ridiculous little microphone drop and

11227.32 --> 11233.020999999999
I'm cool on that guy well nah sorry

11230.521 --> 11235.69
people have brains out here people are

11233.021 --> 11239.051000000001
thinking again critically thinking and

11235.69 --> 11239.671
this nonsense isn't going to last too

11239.051 --> 11241.99
long

11239.671 --> 11256.99
sure it's gonna take it it's gonna take

11241.99 --> 11260.23
a while but its way and I know he has

11256.99 --> 11262.48
published a few things in some journals

11260.23 --> 11265.091
or something but I don't know how smart

11262.48 --> 11268.99
he really is but regardless he's the

11265.091 --> 11271.57
face that science in quotes puts out

11268.99 --> 11273.761
there to tell us things right we're

11271.57 --> 11275.770999999999
supposed to trust him when we turn on

11273.761 --> 11278.771
the TV any drops microphones and said

11275.771 --> 11281.051000000001
there's gravity and you know all that

11278.771 --> 11284.74
nonsense he wants to do he's an actor

11281.051 --> 11287.699999999999
you see it's got a great personality he

11284.74 --> 11291.431
talks with his hands all over the place

11287.7 --> 11295.78
he's science and look I was I was a geek

11291.431 --> 11298.12
I watched cosmos right I watched it I

11295.78 --> 11300.851
took it all in I knew it was you know

11298.12 --> 11301.479000000001
I've heard all those stories before but

11300.851 --> 11303.329
it got

11301.479 --> 11307.06
it's at the same point that I was at

11303.329 --> 11312.609
before why is everything I'm looking at

11307.06 --> 11314.439
CGI why is all this just a story I might

11312.609 --> 11322.049
as well just turn this off and put on

11314.439 --> 11326.709
Dragonball Z and watch that okay so I

11322.049 --> 11330.039
mean that's all I can say at least a

11326.709 --> 11333.1
consignment into a point guys and you

11330.039 --> 11336.939
know it like like Moreau said there are

11333.1 --> 11339.369
some of us who are cool with this I

11336.939 --> 11342.399
don't I've never considered myself to be

11339.369 --> 11343.93
some great debater but the point is is

11342.399 --> 11366.028999999999
that I don't really feel like I need to

11343.93 --> 11371.619
be power to manipulate somebody didn't

11366.029 --> 11373.659
rambling sorry yeah anybody else because

11371.619 --> 11377.939
I was actually gonna round out the show

11373.659 --> 11377.939
we've been going for over three hours

11378.149 --> 11381.249
awesome

11379.329 --> 11383.169
but yeah unless there's more

11381.249 --> 11385.298999999999
conversation material I'm gonna run out

11383.169 --> 11394.39
to show so anybody else wanna wanted to

11385.299 --> 11398.439
share something have anything to new to

11394.39 --> 11400.628999999999
add or but I just agree with the

11398.439 --> 11403.329
sentiment I mean you'll hear people say

11400.629 --> 11404.829000000002
these days all the ballers they will you

11403.329 --> 11407.259
know if you do a search for flutter

11404.829 --> 11409.779
that's the numbers have gone down a lot

11407.259 --> 11411.43
well part of that and I believe a big

11409.779 --> 11413.979000000001
part of that is due to the censorship

11411.43 --> 11415.779
right so because it's not out there in

11413.979 --> 11417.249
people's faces anymore like a lot of us

11415.779 --> 11419.949
came across it do you do YouTube

11417.249 --> 11420.31
suggestions right I wasn't searching for

11419.949 --> 11422.890000000001
flatter

11420.31 --> 11425.528999999999
I got suggested and then eventually

11422.89 --> 11427.239
after like the 56th climate suggested it

11425.529 --> 11429.069000000001
I looked into it but they're not

11427.239 --> 11430.39
suggesting it anymore and when you

11429.069 --> 11434.689
search for it the only thing that comes

11430.39 --> 11435.979
up are debunk sites and debunked videos

11434.689 --> 11439.130000000001
it's not that people aren't interested

11435.979 --> 11440.42
it's that a lot of it is censorship but

11439.13 --> 11443.208999999999
like chocolate said people are talking

11440.42 --> 11444.92
about it it's not going away you can't

11443.209 --> 11447.949
put this genie back in its bottle right

11444.92 --> 11451.31
so they have to they have to be aware of

11447.949 --> 11452.630000000001
that and if you look at a lot of young a

11451.31 --> 11455.84
lot of the videos

11452.63 --> 11460.159
a lot of young kids young kids minds are

11455.84 --> 11461.689
still most mostly open whereas that are

11460.159 --> 11464.09
more closed because the indoctrination

11461.689 --> 11467.689
has been you know I've said in more

11464.09 --> 11469.279
fully I guess but yeah it's not going

11467.689 --> 11471.109
away no matter what they say what they

11469.279 --> 11472.970000000001
think you know Google search is gone

11471.109 --> 11476.959
going down doesn't mean anything it's

11472.97 --> 11479.42
it's gone it's not going anywhere I want

11476.959 --> 11483.109
to add to that with with in regard to

11479.42 --> 11485.93
kids right because we're talking about

11483.109 --> 11490.699
the 24/7 to score before and you know

11485.93 --> 11493.729000000001
the guys say I Horrible's whatever right

11490.699 --> 11495.050000000001
yeah and in my response I say you know

11493.729 --> 11499.13
there are a lot of kids that get in

11495.05 --> 11500.688999999998
there and troll but I've heard since

11499.13 --> 11502.819
I've been going in there and I've having

11500.689 --> 11506.959
me gone in there very long since I have

11502.819 --> 11509.18
I've heard kids that have literally had

11506.959 --> 11513.699
my mouth open like holy [ __ ]

11509.18 --> 11517.069
some of these kids are smart as hell and

11513.699 --> 11519.92
some of them got this like they

11517.069 --> 11521.868999999999
understand what's going on and they're

11519.92 --> 11525.319
asking the questions they're having

11521.869 --> 11528.739000000001
conversations that some of these globe

11525.319 --> 11533.538999999999
trolls that have been in this for four

11528.739 --> 11537.229
years right don't even have a grasp on

11533.539 --> 11540.949
it and it's an astonishes me I'm like

11537.229 --> 11545.739
holy [ __ ] and it's a beautiful thing to

11540.949 --> 11548.84
hear kids because honestly if I if this

11545.739 --> 11551.538999999999
you want to call it movement whatever it

11548.84 --> 11553.999
is the link if this was yeah this

11551.539 --> 11559.609
awakening that's a better if this was

11553.999 --> 11562.458999999999
going on when I was 10 12 different Flat

11559.609 --> 11565.1
Earth or at 10 or 12 if I had people to

11562.459 --> 11567.439
talk to about yes because I was one of

11565.1 --> 11568.591
those people that had problems with this

11567.439 --> 11571.591
globe since

11568.591 --> 11574.86
I was a kid if say the internet was

11571.591 --> 11577.83
there in the way it is now then yeah

11574.86 --> 11579.811
yeah me too probably because every time

11577.83 --> 11582.211
I didn't get confronted with it which I

11579.811 --> 11584.4
shared openly had has happened many

11582.211 --> 11587.971
times during my life it's just the

11584.4 --> 11590.551
isolation of it or the extreme responses

11587.971 --> 11592.891
would just make me forget about it

11590.551 --> 11595.65
because it was miserable because I had

11592.891 --> 11599.100999999999
nobody to reflect upon with it or people

11595.65 --> 11602.551
that would do weird things if I brought

11599.101 --> 11606.541000000001
it up get really pissed off or even like

11602.551 --> 11608.791
try to punish me yes why to me now like

11606.541 --> 11613.770999999999
the people want to salt me call me I

11608.791 --> 11617.369999999999
don't get to flying okay because I've

11613.771 --> 11620.461000000001
been a weirdo since I was a kid I'm okay

11617.37 --> 11623.251
with that okay continue trying to prove

11620.461 --> 11625.680999999999
you're spitting ball that's what I want

11623.251 --> 11627.36
then I can go back to just playing video

11625.681 --> 11628.08
games and doing other dumb [ __ ] like

11627.36 --> 11630.931
everybody else

11628.08 --> 11632.671
okay so then I'm tired of being lied to

11630.931 --> 11635.791000000001
about the [ __ ] world that I live in

11632.671 --> 11638.16
the tired of people scrambling to try to

11635.791 --> 11641.461
prove gravity some nonsense that they

11638.16 --> 11643.591
cannot prove but will do everything they

11641.461 --> 11644.670999999998
can to show us that they can't prove it

11643.591 --> 11649.23
fantastic

11644.671 --> 11651.69
continue doing that have a good day they

11649.23 --> 11654.029999999999
always bring out the super elaborate

11651.69 --> 11655.471000000001
story of how it but it fits so perfect

11654.03 --> 11657.36
you look at fits in here and fits in

11655.471 --> 11660.270999999999
there yeah where is it the actual proof

11657.36 --> 11664.471000000001
it fits so well it has to be there

11660.271 --> 11666.601
that's basically it you know I can look

11664.471 --> 11669.211
at it objectively if there was proof of

11666.601 --> 11672.57
this stuff I wouldn't be holding on to

11669.211 --> 11677.131
flat earth right but the person that I

11672.57 --> 11679.381
am has to hold on to truth okay and when

11677.131 --> 11682.23
I see something and I see it's [ __ ]

11679.381 --> 11683.939999999999
I'm gonna call it [ __ ] and a lot

11682.23 --> 11687.029999999999
more people are doing it and it's

11683.94 --> 11688.921
becoming a problem because we shouldn't

11687.03 --> 11692.58
be debating about this this should have

11688.921 --> 11694.44
been established already okay there's no

11692.58 --> 11696.421
reason why this debate should be on

11694.44 --> 11700.051000000001
nobody's debating whether the sky is

11696.421 --> 11702.27
blue sometimes it's red it's got

11700.051 --> 11703.948999999999
difficult but for the most part the sky

11702.27 --> 11706.35
blue nobody's debating that because we

11703.949 --> 11710.810000000001
know that we don't debate things that we

11706.35 --> 11710.81
know why is why is this little debate

11711.14 --> 11720.09
okay well what's the consensus science

11717.92 --> 11721.399
scientific reasoning of why the sky is

11720.09 --> 11739.02
blue

11721.399 --> 11743.278999999999
anybody know Einstein he's the one who

11739.02 --> 11746.819000000001
did he's one know what's what's that

11743.279 --> 11750.149000000001
consensus science claim about why the

11746.819 --> 11752.01
sky is blue I prefer the name the

11750.149 --> 11754.8
phenomena is called but it's just the

11752.01 --> 11758.489
scattering of the light it happens to be

11754.8 --> 11761.608999999999
the blue it blue is the smallest on the

11758.489 --> 11763.14
spectrum and so there's a name for it

11761.609 --> 11766.92
something scattering so that was called

11763.14 --> 11768.599999999999
refraction you mean um I think it might

11766.92 --> 11772.68
be related to refraction I'm not 100%

11768.6 --> 11777.59
sure but why is the sky blue in in the

11772.68 --> 11779.75
daytime and then the sky black at night

11777.59 --> 11788.909
well this guy's butter there's no right

11779.75 --> 11792.569
buddies like act the same way no in in

11788.909 --> 11795.21
the daytime the water and the oceans are

11792.569 --> 11801.14
blue in the nighttime the waters in the

11795.21 --> 11801.14
oceans are black just like the sky yeah

11801.409 --> 11813.239
this guy still blew it not the oceans

11807.96 --> 11815.64
are not exactly blue Dale whatever when

11813.239 --> 11819.149
there's no light green blue is only in

11815.64 --> 11822.84
like tropical regions at low water

11819.149 --> 11824.76
levels oh yeah when there's no light

11822.84 --> 11829.189
there's black and darkness because

11824.76 --> 11829.189
without light there's no colors so

11831.03 --> 11837.221000000001
yeah I was just trying to figure out

11833.11 --> 11842.621000000001
what the container was right it's blue

11837.221 --> 11845.051
whatever it is well yeah the containers

11842.621 --> 11847.871
and all and you see how we have to try

11845.051 --> 11849.881
to kind of speculate as to what it might

11847.871 --> 11852.609999999999
be right all the money that we're

11849.881 --> 11856.561
spending on NASA all this [ __ ]

11852.61 --> 11860.171
sending people to space and and and our

11856.561 --> 11861.971
Rovers on Mars and you know China wants

11860.171 --> 11864.971
to land on the far side of the Moon I

11861.971 --> 11867.131
mean all this nonsense when that could

11864.971 --> 11869.949999999999
be well spent on other things like

11867.131 --> 11873.66
actually getting out there information

11869.95 --> 11876.730000000001
about the actual reality we live in a

11873.66 --> 11880.511
grave and memories oh I so like paint

11876.73 --> 11883.600999999999
hearing how uh I don't I can't confirm

11880.511 --> 11885.73
whether it's true this NASA's getting 50

11883.601 --> 11888.631000000001
million [ __ ] dollars a day or

11885.73 --> 11890.949999999999
something like that that's insanity

11888.631 --> 11892.24
whether it's a lie or not that's what

11890.95 --> 11892.961000000001
they're putting out there and that's

11892.24 --> 11896.921
insanity

11892.961 --> 11904.23
yeah billion a year

11896.921 --> 11906.881
oh that's nice so you're okay with that

11904.23 --> 11910.48
yeah absolutely I'm 100 I would give

11906.881 --> 11915.699999999999
them more money your heart oh yeah for a

11910.48 --> 11918.430999999999
fact he went to trillion dollars not to

11915.7 --> 11919.961000000001
do what a trillion dollars to go to war

11918.431 --> 11922.24
that they go to war that bases all over

11919.961 --> 11925.391
the world it's not amazin that money's

11922.24 --> 11928.57
not know I'm talking about space Oh NASA

11925.391 --> 11930.07
talk is they send Rockets up and well

11928.57 --> 11933.07
did they do why four other people do it

11930.07 --> 11935.291
at this point but now listen like what

11933.07 --> 11937.601
is that money being used for to send

11935.291 --> 11940.721
[ __ ] into space satellites up to ten

11937.601 --> 11943.421
what we charged Jupiter learners learn

11940.721 --> 11945.341
about all the moons learn about what

11943.421 --> 11947.141
have we learned about Jupiter's moons

11945.341 --> 11950.74
that has helped me we learned that

11947.141 --> 11953.621
series of land tax money does not just

11950.74 --> 11956.53
pay for satellites when their satellites

11953.621 --> 11960.670999999998
involves usually corporations or the

11956.53 --> 11963.371000000001
military they pay for it separately yeah

11960.671 --> 11964.18
it doesn't go out of NASA's budget so

11963.371 --> 11968.198999999999
yeah

11964.18 --> 11969.249
wooden ways for their money on really he

11968.199 --> 11970.630000000001
didn't ask you what private companies

11969.249 --> 11972.76
paid for he said what does NASA use that

11970.63 --> 11974.679999999998
money for they also put satellites up

11972.76 --> 11976.869
there and they also send stuff to Ceres

11974.68 --> 11978.459
up where and it the dwarf planet in

11976.869 --> 11980.829
between Mars and Jupiter which has more

11978.459 --> 11982.029
fresh water than Earth's and they

11980.829 --> 11987.489
discover things like that because they

11982.029 --> 11989.560000000001
send things up there we are we having a

11987.489 --> 11991.779
water shortage that we're gonna go get

11989.56 --> 11993.399
that and bring it back no but you know

11991.779 --> 11995.02
there's that's where we rush water

11993.399 --> 11999.069
there's more fresh water on that planet

11995.02 --> 12000.449
and there's an earth where I'm serious

11999.069 --> 12008.43
the dwarf planet in between Mars and

12000.449 --> 12010.880000000001
Jupiter was a dwarf planet it's like a

12008.43 --> 12028.68
third of the mass of the asteroid belt

12010.88 --> 12038.569
talk about well meaning if we needed but

12028.68 --> 12038.569
it's just we do need because the climate

12038.899 --> 12044.55
change propaganda hasn't worked so they

12041.669 --> 12047.729
need a giant meteorite full with water

12044.55 --> 12051.81
to make sure that the sea levels rise so

12047.729 --> 12053.659
that thing they would be bringing it

12051.81 --> 12055.829
would probably use for something like a

12053.659 --> 12056.999
future space missions and they had a

12055.829 --> 12058.499
base somewhere this is a place they

12056.999 --> 12060.329
could get water from potentially the

12058.499 --> 12062.489
same thing they did to the moon when

12060.329 --> 12064.77
they sent a projectile to it in like

12062.489 --> 12067.14
2006 to see if there was water there and

12064.77 --> 12068.789
they found it on the poles and for the

12067.14 --> 12071.458999999999
same reason they could use that water

12068.789 --> 12075.899000000001
they found water on the moon in 2008

12071.459 --> 12078.439
when they said I watched that live on TV

12075.899 --> 12078.439
I remember that

12088.859 --> 12095.76
they know that they found water at the

12091.68 --> 12099.87
poles of the moon on Charlie 6 this

12095.76 --> 12100.979
makes me guys can wear me you keep on

12099.87 --> 12103.77
talking over me

12100.979 --> 12108.63
I hear you alright hey guys so I was

12103.77 --> 12110.91
just making a joke man like did is that

12108.63 --> 12113.67
water on the moon is that where they got

12110.91 --> 12127.8
the petrified wood from that workers

12113.67 --> 12136.859
maybe make sense flood of its own how

12127.8 --> 12140.25
much is it more than one as if it is I'd

12136.859 --> 12142.890000000001
like to know I've only heard of one have

12140.25 --> 12147.83
you ever seen one a moon rock no I

12142.89 --> 12149.789999999999
haven't and how do you know they exist

12147.83 --> 12151.47
because I know how much they brought

12149.79 --> 12154.439
back there's but I've heard a lot of

12151.47 --> 12157.59
this but I've seen one how do you know

12154.439 --> 12160.130000000001
one exists for yourself as I trust and I

12157.59 --> 12165.18
trust and fellow you just like I just

12160.13 --> 12167.369999999999
aged ensues correct no just don't trust

12165.18 --> 12168.960000000001
that stuff we say to you could you draw

12167.37 --> 12171.210000000001
me we're not submitting if you don't

12168.96 --> 12175.14
believe us well I mean no I've measured

12171.21 --> 12177.589999999998
the spin I've measured we'll talk we'll

12175.14 --> 12180.539999999999
talk outside of this because there's

12177.59 --> 12184.29
control I'm gonna round it out now yeah

12180.54 --> 12186.330000000002
so it was great having you guys thank

12184.29 --> 12188.069000000001
you let's do this again sometimes maybe

12186.33 --> 12190.649
next Saturday I'm gonna throw my panel

12188.069 --> 12193.92
open like this again so thank you all

12190.649 --> 12195.72
the morning parties do it next time

12193.92 --> 12198.06
maybe we can present evidence for the

12195.72 --> 12199.858999999999
claims yeah if you stick around

12198.06 --> 12201.71
afterwards I'll show to you and if

12199.859 --> 12210.6
you're if you're not scared to see it
