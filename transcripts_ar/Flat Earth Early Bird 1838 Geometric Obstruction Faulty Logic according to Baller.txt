Thursday the 18th of January

190.12 --> 194.0
2024 it's good to be

195.36 --> 202.04000000000002
back yeah yesterday I was super

199.04 --> 202.04
sick

202.92 --> 207.72
so definitely did the entire day

208.68 --> 211.68
off

212.239 --> 218.20000000000002
cuz like yeah what is it

216.239 --> 221.68
now

218.2 --> 224.439
Tuesday this Tuesday I was like on very

221.68 --> 224.439
high tension

226.319 --> 232.79899999999998
overall and I no this like the problem

229.439 --> 234.799
is is that when that starts to happen

232.799 --> 236.959
when the tension becomes too high like

234.799 --> 240.84
that it's like on my

236.959 --> 242.92000000000002
internal wheel it's all kind of as IC

240.84 --> 244.959
when it starts spinning really fast I

242.92 --> 247.23899999999998
have like I have Optimal Performance but

244.959 --> 251.84
the problem

247.239 --> 256.72
is it never stops like it doesn't go

251.84 --> 258.959
slower so it actually ramps up and then

256.72 --> 262.47900000000004
it basically goes out of control and

258.959 --> 265.24
then well usually I start to do things

262.479 --> 269.15999999999997
that will make me sick like suddenly

265.24 --> 270.88
drink alcohol a lot of it that's how I

269.16 --> 272.56
that would have would happen in the past

270.88 --> 275.68
well that didn't happen now because I

272.56 --> 277.039
don't drink alcohol and had everything

275.68 --> 279.44
pretty much under control but I

277.039 --> 282.36
basically yeah things went

279.44 --> 287.8
cataclysmically wrong all of a

282.36 --> 290.0
sudden was in the middle of just a

287.8 --> 292.199
hassle trying to

290.0 --> 295.72
communicate and then I accidentally

292.199 --> 298.08000000000004
logged out of my Google account and then

295.72 --> 301.56
I couldn't get in again and I had a

298.08 --> 301.56
total panic attack

303.199 --> 306.759
thought that I was just like because

305.199 --> 308.24
yeah then you can't get in the email it

306.759 --> 310.91900000000004
was completely locked out was a

308.24 --> 314.08
nightmare and I had a total panic attack

310.919 --> 316.12
got sick from the stress of it and just

314.08 --> 317.35999999999996
started throwing up and that didn't stop

316.12 --> 320.0
for pretty

317.36 --> 323.91900000000004
much 10 to 12

320.0 --> 323.919
hours was really [ __ ]

324.8 --> 331.6
up not the first time that it happened

327.68 --> 333.8
but every time it does it's a freaking

331.6 --> 339.12
nightmare right but yeah I managed to

333.8 --> 341.84000000000003
recover get some sleep eventually

339.12 --> 344.52
yesterday even called my healer and

341.84 --> 348.28
everything so it got in place and then

344.52 --> 350.479
also like it's like yeah because on

348.28 --> 352.31899999999996
Tuesday night it was like ah I'm in a

350.479 --> 355.59999999999997
panic attack oh I'm going to lose my

352.319 --> 358.16
life and I'm like no no Arwin you just

355.6 --> 360.56
have to wait until you're calm down and

358.16 --> 363.319
then you'll fix it

360.56 --> 364.6
you can't worry about that now you have

363.319 --> 368.88
to calm

364.6 --> 370.59900000000005
down and I did and then like the next

368.88 --> 373.71999999999997
day I was just

370.599 --> 375.56
like trying it again like okay I was

373.72 --> 377.759
afraid like oh if I get it wrong too

375.56 --> 380.0
many times I'll get locked out well that

377.759 --> 383.319
didn't really seem to

380.0 --> 386.319
happen and then I I got the password

383.319 --> 389.52000000000004
right all of it and so I'm fully

386.319 --> 391.08000000000004
restored now and the entire reason why

389.52 --> 393.15999999999997
even got the panic attack has been

391.08 --> 395.24
availed like that's not going to happen

393.16 --> 398.08000000000004
anytime soon like I I remember the

395.24 --> 400.96000000000004
passwords now I know what directions I

398.08 --> 403.84
will have to seek

400.96 --> 408.4
it I wasn't

403.84 --> 410.599
sure but now I am anyway so I'm back but

408.4 --> 413.52
yeah I'm still like physically

410.599 --> 413.52
recovering from

418.039 --> 424.31899999999996
that ah

421.199 --> 426.319
so yeah I have a coffee at already but

424.319 --> 429.199
I'm really seriously wondering if I

426.319 --> 429.199
should be doing

430.72 --> 436.24
that it might have like a negative but

433.52 --> 438.31899999999996
anyway if it if something goes wrong I

436.24 --> 442.759
got

438.319 --> 445.56
these an an acid stuff which is just

442.759 --> 448.8
aute just to like not make it painful

445.56 --> 450.4
and yeah just take nips of it when it

448.8 --> 452.319
happens

450.4 --> 455.919
so I should be overall fine haven't

452.319 --> 458.72
thrown up since yesterday so I'm all

455.919 --> 460.96
good and I feel really cleansed that's

458.72 --> 463.59900000000005
the weird because this is the thing

460.96 --> 465.35999999999996
every time that happens and yeah I can

463.599 --> 468.639
say that now every time that happens

465.36 --> 468.639
because it has like

468.68 --> 474.44
happened at least

471.12 --> 476.68
like 10 to 20 times throughout my life

474.44 --> 478.28
it's just that I always forget about it

476.68 --> 480.44
because it's so freaking nightmarish

478.28 --> 483.31899999999996
when it does but but every time after

480.44 --> 487.479
that it's like I'm completely clean out

483.319 --> 490.36
I'm like really like I suddenly regain

487.479 --> 493.639
all my smell

490.36 --> 495.639
senses really strong and it's like I'm

493.639 --> 497.96000000000004
suddenly noticing like the details of

495.639 --> 499.759
smell a lot it's very fascinating that

497.96 --> 502.68
that happens right

499.759 --> 505.759
after

502.68 --> 508.919
and everything just feels

505.759 --> 512.279
younger like my organs I don't know it's

508.919 --> 515.039
like almost a work out for my

512.279 --> 518.519
organs weird it's weird but I mean I

515.039 --> 518.519
feel really

521.399 --> 528.399
refreshed and I'm just fascinated too

524.68 --> 531.5999999999999
like okay this is a a thing with

528.399 --> 534.48
me it's part of my tension cycle the

531.6 --> 537.12
tension that like internally I need to

534.48 --> 541.519
have to pay

537.12 --> 544.12
attention to get serious to get

541.519 --> 548.079
building

544.12 --> 551.48
basically but then like eventually I

548.079 --> 554.68
will like naturally just like I want

551.48 --> 558.24
more and then it becomes too much and

554.68 --> 559.16
then the wheel goes out of control I

558.24 --> 562.16
start

559.16 --> 564.6
doing bad decisions or like suddenly

562.16 --> 566.959
like I'm going to like do this or that

564.6 --> 568.12
and that ruins everything and then I get

566.959 --> 570.399
super

568.12 --> 572.88
sick

570.399 --> 576.04
it's happened every time like that it's

572.88 --> 579.519
really an art on like when I go out of

576.04 --> 581.92
control how do I do something that's in

579.519 --> 584.2
line with that without it literally

581.92 --> 587.959
destroying my life entirely that's like

584.2 --> 590.88
always like oh [ __ ] because it's like

587.959 --> 590.88
something's going to

591.56 --> 594.8
happen all

598.12 --> 604.399
right

600.24 --> 607.2
honey lemon hot water yeah I drank a lot

604.399 --> 607.2
of apple juice

608.2 --> 613.72
yesterday that did it for

610.44 --> 617.2790000000001
me lemon not so much and I'm staying

613.72 --> 619.72
away from sugar including honey

617.279 --> 622.519
like honey is really great when you have

619.72 --> 625.32
sore throat or respiratory issues I had

622.519 --> 628.04
none of that was pure stomach it's just

625.32 --> 631.0400000000001
the muscle there going

628.04 --> 631.04
[ __ ]

632.279 --> 636.4399999999999
to the point where sometimes it's like

634.12 --> 640.079
yeah it's trying to implode itself like

636.44 --> 643.6
to turn itself inside out it's not

640.079 --> 645.92
a yeah well that's what it

643.6 --> 649.0400000000001
is but

645.92 --> 652.12
uh eventually it did stop it's just

649.04 --> 653.12
amazing like I'm just lying in bed there

652.12 --> 656.92
just

653.12 --> 659.24
like only having like a few seconds of

656.92 --> 661.5999999999999
relief after I thrown up and just enough

659.24 --> 664.88
to just like get a sense of relief for a

661.6 --> 667.519
bit and then it goes back again and that

664.88 --> 670.2
just never stops like 12 hour never like

667.519 --> 672.36
you're really sore muscled from just

670.2 --> 675.76
being [ __ ] cramped all the time it's

672.36 --> 678.32
it is a nightmare it is

675.76 --> 681.16
torturous but then eventually it's like

678.32 --> 683.12
you just go into like a half dream state

681.16 --> 684.76
while your body is all [ __ ] up intense

683.12 --> 686.6
your mind is just like going to

684.76 --> 690.3199999999999
compartmentalized and like starting to

686.6 --> 693.36
dream basically like a living day dream

690.32 --> 696.44
which helps you distract you from the

693.36 --> 699.5600000000001
pain it's like an illusion you create

696.44 --> 702.48
just to like get away from the continual

699.56 --> 704.4399999999999
torment sounds so very dramatic it it is

702.48 --> 705.6
in that moment I wouldn't I don't wish

704.44 --> 709.2
that upon

705.6 --> 710.9590000000001
anyone but uh some people out there

709.2 --> 714.519
might know what this is

710.959 --> 716.76
like but then all of a sudden like while

714.519 --> 719.24
you're then stuck in that dream state to

716.76 --> 721.519
distract it suddenly you just know this

719.24 --> 724.8
after a while like

721.519 --> 724.8
hey it

725.32 --> 730.279
stopped and you can't tell even how long

728.079 --> 733.4399999999999
that took it's just all of a sudden you

730.279 --> 736.6
just notice like hey it

733.44 --> 741.0
stopped you're so stuck in that that

736.6 --> 743.639
distracting Blissful dream

741.0 --> 747.279
light is this like by the way that

743.639 --> 749.44
specific mind state is very specific to

747.279 --> 752.8389999999999
sickness I've noticed like

749.44 --> 755.8800000000001
it only works when like this region of

752.839 --> 759.1600000000001
your organs is like really upset then

755.88 --> 763.32
dream state can help to distract cuz it

759.16 --> 765.519
it is like like very bright but soft

763.32 --> 767.9590000000001
light inside of your head it's like this

765.519 --> 770.5600000000001
cloud of light you're just like ah and

767.959 --> 773.199
it's only Associated for me with like

770.56 --> 776.6389999999999
actual sickness not like oh I have to

773.199 --> 779.88
cough but like being stomach

776.639 --> 782.5600000000001
sick that kind of thing it's interesting

779.88 --> 786.199
how that very specific dream state can

782.56 --> 787.68
like help you out to really not go

786.199 --> 791.12
absolutely

787.68 --> 793.959
insane from like the acute torment that

791.12 --> 796.92
is continually asking your

793.959 --> 800.04
attention

796.92 --> 803.959
anyway right and like during all that I

800.04 --> 807.04
was drinking Min tea like just to get it

803.959 --> 809.88
in my system quick so that I wouldn't

807.04 --> 811.8389999999999
just be throwing up pure acid

809.88 --> 814.399
it was a great decision by the way in

811.839 --> 815.9590000000001
the past that I I haven't done that and

814.399 --> 817.56
it just wouldn't drink because I was too

815.959 --> 820.2399999999999
afraid to throw it up again but I mean

817.56 --> 822.3199999999999
it's going to happen anyway but then

820.24 --> 824.72
like it would be really

822.32 --> 828.0400000000001
painful because it would like the acid

824.72 --> 829.36
would just keep getting made there like

828.04 --> 832.079
that happens

829.36 --> 834.6
too but then if you don't dilute

832.079 --> 837.7589999999999
it

834.6 --> 840.759
terrible so I just

837.759 --> 840.759
like

840.8 --> 847.959
minty and I worked great very little

845.079 --> 850.5999999999999
damage anyway and after that like as

847.959 --> 852.4399999999999
soon as the throwing up stops like then

850.6 --> 855.48
you can think of what am I actually

852.44 --> 855.48
going to try to eat or

858.72 --> 864.72
drink and by the time the evening had

861.199 --> 867.3199999999999
arrived I was really hungry like the the

864.72 --> 869.759
night during the night I like got really

867.32 --> 872.1990000000001
hungry it's like whoo like I really need

869.759 --> 872.1990000000001
to eat

872.88 --> 880.519
something got a blueberry yogurt which

877.839 --> 884.44
was excellent for

880.519 --> 886.24
that and earlier like toasting my bread

884.44 --> 890.0
normally I don't do that and toasting it

886.24 --> 892.639
and then had a cooked egg with that

890.0 --> 896.759
which is very weird for me I never cook

892.639 --> 899.8
eggs I haven't eat eaten that

896.759 --> 903.399
since since

899.8 --> 906.3599999999999
my old home with my parents and all

903.399 --> 909.0
that but it was nice it was better like

906.36 --> 909.9590000000001
I thought like I don't want to bake this

909.0 --> 913.959
egg

909.959 --> 916.199
now just made a toast put some butter on

913.959 --> 917.399
that and M melted in it nice and and all

916.199 --> 920.12
that and then

917.399 --> 921.48
just slices of that cooked egg on that

920.12 --> 925.199
and that worked

921.48 --> 925.1990000000001
great with a little bit of

927.279 --> 934.6
salt let good recovery

931.24 --> 939.519
food also like yeah high grade organic

934.6 --> 941.9200000000001
apple juice damer quality worked really

939.519 --> 945.519
great it's kind of funny because that

941.92 --> 945.519
drink is normally like too

945.56 --> 951.8389999999999
acidic but because of the whole

948.56 --> 953.7589999999999
situation like that wasn't it it wasn't

951.839 --> 954.6800000000001
annoying or painful it was actually like

953.759 --> 957.6
oh

954.68 --> 959.7199999999999
yeah come right

957.6 --> 962.519
in

959.72 --> 965.1990000000001
so that's what I did anyway yeah sorry

962.519 --> 968.079
to roll in the whole sickness story but

965.199 --> 971.24
it is what I went through yesterday is

968.079 --> 975.519
also the reason I didn't have a

971.24 --> 975.519
show right but it's I'm all

975.72 --> 979.639
back it's all working

986.12 --> 992.72
again Watch the movie on recommendation

990.12 --> 995.279
of om Benjamin was really funny I hadn't

992.72 --> 998.279
seen that one

995.279 --> 998.279
before

1000.44 --> 1008.0400000000001
um what is it called again I downloaded

1004.319 --> 1008.04
it was

1015.04 --> 1020.48
uh it ah yeah Me Myself and Irene

1019.279 --> 1024.92
from

1020.48 --> 1024.92
uh H forget his

1025.16 --> 1031.16
name I don't know why I'm forgetting his

1028.079 --> 1033.4389999999999
name that's ridiculous it's one of my

1031.16 --> 1037.1200000000001
favorite actors

1033.439 --> 1040.64
uh Jim Carrey right but the weird thing

1037.12 --> 1040.6399999999999
is I've never seen it

1040.76 --> 1045.16
before because in the time when this

1043.319 --> 1050.72
came

1045.16 --> 1053.0800000000002
out guess what I didn't like it because

1050.72 --> 1054.76
it's literally about him being like

1053.08 --> 1057.96
schizophrenic like

1054.76 --> 1060.16
that and I was basically just finding

1057.96 --> 1062.48
out that I had something like that and I

1060.16 --> 1066.0
really didn't want

1062.48 --> 1068.3600000000001
that so I avoided that movie at the

1066.0 --> 1070.6
time because I felt it was like a

1068.36 --> 1072.12
personal attack because of the weird

1070.6 --> 1073.559
things that I was experienced with the

1072.12 --> 1075.799
dark world and all that and like

1073.559 --> 1077.3999999999999
parallel experiences that are just like

1075.799 --> 1080.4
in between

1077.4 --> 1080.4
everything

1082.44 --> 1085.8400000000001
I mean it's very shocking when you're

1084.159 --> 1088.7990000000002
just like with your

1085.84 --> 1090.8799999999999
friends and then suddenly like you just

1088.799 --> 1095.2
roll into something

1090.88 --> 1096.96
like really interesting and weird and

1095.2 --> 1099.159
unexpected and then you have a

1096.96 --> 1100.559
conversation about that event with them

1099.159 --> 1102.88
and they're like what the hell are you

1100.559 --> 1102.8799999999999
talking

1103.12 --> 1107.1999999999998
about that's [ __ ] up

1107.32 --> 1111.96
man

1109.24 --> 1115.1200000000001
like that's not fun and it made me feel

1111.96 --> 1117.2
really like insecure about myself and

1115.12 --> 1120.52
all and I know why it that was there

1117.2 --> 1123.64
it's all because of the torment right

1120.52 --> 1124.76
but it's just very freaky like they like

1123.64 --> 1126.2
yeah you're going with your friend

1124.76 --> 1128.24
somewhere and you go in there and then

1126.2 --> 1129.72
suddenly oh look at this place whoa

1128.24 --> 1133.159
what's going on in there oh let's go in

1129.72 --> 1135.32
there and crazy things happen and you

1133.159 --> 1137.3200000000002
don't even remember well how you got out

1135.32 --> 1139.4399999999998
of there but then you're like

1137.32 --> 1141.3999999999999
back

1139.44 --> 1145.559
and it's like

1141.4 --> 1148.96
wow do you remember this from like a

1145.559 --> 1151.2
week ago and they're like uh no what are

1148.96 --> 1154.52
you talking

1151.2 --> 1157.0800000000002
about and then like it's really like

1154.52 --> 1160.12
that's shocking

1157.08 --> 1162.96
it yeah so I didn't like the movie much

1160.12 --> 1165.2399999999998
at the time because of well the

1162.96 --> 1167.6000000000001
theme but I watched it and I thought it

1165.24 --> 1169.84
was great it was a really funny

1167.6 --> 1172.799
interesting

1169.84 --> 1175.9189999999999
movie it was a really good

1172.799 --> 1178.44
one so yeah I got

1175.919 --> 1181.159
that because Owen Benjamin named it

1178.44 --> 1181.159
yesterday on his

1183.799 --> 1188.9189999999999
stream that's kind of funny first he was

1186.24 --> 1191.1200000000001
like talking [ __ ] about him and then

1188.919 --> 1192.48
realizing like wait no he has actually a

1191.12 --> 1196.2399999999998
lot of good

1192.48 --> 1198.88
movies and I agree he's great whatever

1196.24 --> 1201.24
his weird political thing

1198.88 --> 1203.64
here and there might be or probably not

1201.24 --> 1206.64
he's been kind of a conspiracy theorist

1203.64 --> 1206.64
guy

1207.44 --> 1214.3200000000002
interesting but the Cable Guy cable guy

1210.96 --> 1218.039
is freaking weird man I mean that movie

1214.32 --> 1219.2
like genuinely creeps me out there cuz

1218.039 --> 1222.28
it's

1219.2 --> 1224.44
like it's funny but at the same time

1222.28 --> 1226.8799999999999
it's not really funny it's like just

1224.44 --> 1231.559
creepy and it's like you never really

1226.88 --> 1234.88
know cable guide is a weird movie very

1231.559 --> 1234.8799999999999
strange very

1235.039 --> 1239.4
psychological I don't find it a very

1237.159 --> 1242.44
pleasant movie to watch but it is a very

1239.4 --> 1242.44
interesting movie

1252.72 --> 1260.1200000000001
though so many good scen absolutely of

1257.12 --> 1260.12
course

1271.6 --> 1275.48
yeah the weird undertone it makes you so

1282.24 --> 1286.64
uncomfortable right anyway I watched

1285.12 --> 1290.2399999999998
that yesterday it was great yeah Truman

1286.64 --> 1293.0
Show brilliant also liar liar I mean

1290.24 --> 1295.88
liar liar is freaking hilarious like

1293.0 --> 1299.48
that's just that's just a funny movie

1295.88 --> 1301.0800000000002
and like that movie works on every age

1299.48 --> 1304.96
like that's a movie you can watch with

1301.08 --> 1307.3999999999999
your family it's amazing it's a good

1304.96 --> 1307.4
funny

1308.76 --> 1317.1589999999999
movie yeah but Truman Show is just very

1313.52 --> 1318.6399999999999
it's like a an interesting concept movie

1317.159 --> 1321.279
it's a good one

1318.64 --> 1323.279
especially if you're like getting into

1321.279 --> 1326.88
Flat Earth or something then it becomes

1323.279 --> 1326.88
like hey check this

1328.72 --> 1333.52
out of

1330.52 --> 1333.52
course

1336.32 --> 1342.72
right but also my personal favorite and

1339.84 --> 1345.279
yeah that's my personal favorites are

1342.72 --> 1349.88
like the Ace Ventura movie especially

1345.279 --> 1354.159
the second one it's just so over the

1349.88 --> 1358.64
top silly I I just freaking love

1354.159 --> 1361.6000000000001
it like there's scenes in that movie Ace

1358.64 --> 1363.5590000000002
Ventura 2 the every time I see I just

1361.6 --> 1365.799
can't help but laugh and every time I

1363.559 --> 1368.96
realize this is so stupid and I can't

1365.799 --> 1368.96
stop laughing over

1369.72 --> 1375.72
it it's so ridiculous it's it's so funny

1373.84 --> 1377.76
it's so ridiculous it's like not funny

1375.72 --> 1382.159
anymore but it's even more ridiculous so

1377.76 --> 1382.1589999999999
it's funny again it's that that kind of

1387.919 --> 1393.64
thing and I love like that scene with

1390.32 --> 1393.6399999999999
the Monopoly guy and all

1394.039 --> 1398.039
that oh but there's so many good

1402.12 --> 1408.1999999999998
scenes when he gets the spears to the

1404.72 --> 1413.1200000000001
knee like that's like I've mimicked that

1408.2 --> 1413.1200000000001
seen quite a few times

1417.799 --> 1424.96
like sorry it's I can't do it justice I

1422.2 --> 1427.64
just that scene is so freaking silly and

1424.96 --> 1429.88
funny I can't help it but every time I

1427.64 --> 1432.5590000000002
see that I

1429.88 --> 1434.919
laugh it's such cartoon

1432.559 --> 1438.72

1434.919 --> 1441.7990000000002

it

1580.72 --> 1586.6000000000001
h yeah dupons you don't there's no such

1584.96 --> 1589.6000000000001

1590.48 --> 1595.32
tritor I don't care what the [ __ ] he

1592.799 --> 1597.32
thinks he is he's been doing that for a

1595.32 --> 1599.4399999999998
while I've done nothing to deserve any

1597.32 --> 1601.0
of that by the way I thought that we

1599.44 --> 1602.88
were

1601.0 --> 1605.72
cool

1602.88 --> 1609.0390000000002
recently but apparently not I don't care

1605.72 --> 1609.039
man just

1610.48 --> 1615.1200000000001
whatever but I'm I'm pretty damn sure

1612.96 --> 1616.6000000000001
that I've done nothing to deserve his

1615.12 --> 1619.6
hostility at

1616.6 --> 1619.6
all

1625.12 --> 1631.4399999999998
right but there's no treachery involved

1627.96 --> 1631.44
uh he never worked for

1646.52 --> 1649.52
me

1676.519 --> 1679.519
m

portrayal of like mental state State and

1737.919 --> 1743.48

1740.96 --> 1745.32
act more in that direction instead of

1743.48 --> 1748.799
just being

1745.32 --> 1751.1589999999999
funny and it was very

1748.799 --> 1753.679

1888.159 --> 1890.6000000000001
before

1894.32 --> 1900.36
yesterday but uh I mean it's a pretty

1897.44 --> 1900.3600000000001
rough movie in

1902.72 --> 1907.32
ways

1904.679 --> 1909.519
like from a certain perspective it

1907.32 --> 1911.639
really hurt watching that especially

1909.519 --> 1914.36
like because like everybody is just

1911.639 --> 1916.639
walking all over that guy and like I've

1914.36 --> 1919.4799999999998
known that I've known what that is like

1916.639 --> 1921.8799999999999
I never really let it well yeah

1919.48 --> 1925.72
sometimes I did I did like let people

1921.88 --> 1925.72
walk over me exactly like

1927.24 --> 1934.08
that things have kind of changed since

1930.919 --> 1937.0800000000002
then yeah but I'm very well familiar

1934.08 --> 1939.96
with that kind of behavior from other

1937.08 --> 1942.36
people and what happens to him basically

1939.96 --> 1945.44
happened to me too you know it as rage

1942.36 --> 1948.4399999999998
win yeah I don't have a completely

1945.44 --> 1951.0800000000002
alternative personality that's so like

1948.44 --> 1954.88
self obsessed and weird and all

1951.08 --> 1954.8799999999999
that but I mean

1957.24 --> 1964.36
yeah I don't let everybody walk over me

1960.96 --> 1964.3600000000001
anymore like they used

1973.159 --> 1979.3990000000001
to

1975.48 --> 1981.279
what coffee is bad for sickness it's

1979.399 --> 1984.279
diuretic

1981.279 --> 1984.279
what

1993.08 --> 1997.72
okay

1994.72 --> 1997.72
sure

2005.96 --> 2008.96
whatever

2009.92 --> 2016.94
[Music]

2021.12 --> 2026.4399999999998
that's good for your digestion okay well

2023.919 --> 2028.679
thanks for the tip I I know how to deal

2026.44 --> 2028.679
with

2029.73 --> 2032.789
[Music]

2035.96 --> 2038.96
coffee

2044.44 --> 2047.039
Brianna

2059.48 --> 2064.839
Johnson right other than the Jim Carrey

2063.04 --> 2069.119
movie from yes I just watched the

2064.839 --> 2071.32
YouTube documentary about highly salassi

2069.119 --> 2073.359
very

2071.32 --> 2076.44
fascinating I think it might not be the

2073.359 --> 2078.96
first time I actually watched that feels

2076.44 --> 2080.48
like I've watched it before but that

2078.96 --> 2081.96
might be through the Dark World because

2080.48 --> 2083.44
I watched a lot of things through the

2081.96 --> 2086.52
Dark

2083.44 --> 2088.919
World a lot it's

2086.52 --> 2091.04
just something that was part of that

2088.919 --> 2093.919
it's like yeah you can

2091.04 --> 2096.96
watch the videos from the

2093.919 --> 2100.64
future seemed like it was like a massive

2096.96 --> 2102.7200000000003
like wow that's amazing but later I only

2100.64 --> 2105.64
realized that everything I watched was

2102.72 --> 2108.04
watching through my own eyes from the

2105.64 --> 2110.24
future so basically like got a for

2108.04 --> 2111.359
glimpse of everything that I was going

2110.24 --> 2115.2
to

2111.359 --> 2117.04
see this is weird also yeah because it's

2115.2 --> 2120.04
a different

2117.04 --> 2121.72
state while you're doing that you're in

2120.04 --> 2124.56
a different type of State as like when

2121.72 --> 2127.4399999999996
you were actually normally watching

2124.56 --> 2129.52
it so it's going to have very strange

2127.44 --> 2131.839
responses the things that like that

2129.52 --> 2134.32
you're experiencing like having a

2131.839 --> 2135.56
different response to what you're having

2134.32 --> 2137.8
at the time you're actually going to

2135.56 --> 2141.92
have it it's weird dark world is

2137.8 --> 2141.92
freaking weird man it's just freaking

2145.8 --> 2153.0
weird but yeah very interesting figure

2150.359 --> 2154.96
and I never realized that he was

2153.0 --> 2158.48
basically fighting

2154.96 --> 2162.319
communism which makes him even more

2158.48 --> 2166.0
awesome I never realized that it's not

2162.319 --> 2169.88
only like a basically like a unique

2166.0 --> 2171.119
Christian leader in a way there that

2169.88 --> 2174.56
they have their own

2171.119 --> 2177.2000000000003
Christianity but they also

2174.56 --> 2180.2
basically fought

2177.2 --> 2183.1189999999997
communism and yeah eventually didn't

2180.2 --> 2183.1189999999997
really work out that

2185.72 --> 2188.72
great

2202.28 --> 2207.76
yeah no [ __ ]

2204.079 --> 2207.76
Sherlock duh

2211.16 --> 2218.92
duper I get too angry well I am I am

2215.0 --> 2218.92
what I am and that's what it it

2228.44 --> 2235.0
is I don't think I'm getting angry too

2231.44 --> 2237.599
angry at all over things that's just how

2235.0 --> 2237.599
angry I

2237.72 --> 2244.68
get Hitler wannab be what the

2241.68 --> 2244.68
[ __ ]

2245.599 --> 2248.599
wow

2261.48 --> 2268.119
I'm a Hitler wab be guys I want to be

2264.079 --> 2271.119
like Hitler so much yes of course

2268.119 --> 2271.119
what

2272.68 --> 2279.56
why because I think that communism is

2276.04 --> 2282.2799999999997
literally like like the devil's ideology

2279.56 --> 2284.72
provably

2282.28 --> 2287.2000000000003
philosophically and that makes me Hitler

2284.72 --> 2290.72
wannab be okay

2287.2 --> 2293.48
okay oh proof is in the pudding yeah

2290.72 --> 2295.7599999999998
look at every freaking civilization that

2293.48 --> 2298.16
under go communism see how well they do

2295.76 --> 2298.1600000000003
while that

2298.52 --> 2305.52
happens see what the overall death rate

2302.28 --> 2308.52
is during such times

2305.52 --> 2308.52
h

2312.48 --> 2318.88
wow okay trolls are out they think they

2315.68 --> 2321.8799999999997
can do something they're

2318.88 --> 2321.88
wrong

2331.52 --> 2335.64
pathetic and

2333.28 --> 2338.3590000000004
besides who knows I might get a

2335.64 --> 2340.0789999999997
girlfriend somewhere soon there are some

2338.359 --> 2342.44
ladies out there that I've kind of

2340.079 --> 2345.8390000000004
gotten to know and I think maybe I'll

2342.44 --> 2345.839
make a move some

2346.04 --> 2352.8
point it's just that I now want to take

2350.16 --> 2352.7999999999997
it really

2353.079 --> 2360.88
slow like I've had my I've had my share

2358.48 --> 2362.839
of the typical things that a guy wants

2360.88 --> 2366.56
from a woman

2362.839 --> 2368.64
yeah and I'm just like no I don't really

2366.56 --> 2370.599
care all that much about that anymore I

2368.64 --> 2374.2
just want a woman that's reliable like I

2370.599 --> 2374.2000000000003
don't even care about the rest

2374.76 --> 2380.28
anymore so I'll be very content to just

2377.8 --> 2383.8
like get to know at a distance for five

2380.28 --> 2383.8
years before I anything do

2390.52 --> 2398.4
anything right oh yeah 28 Subs yeah that

2394.04 --> 2398.4

sun is really

2552.599 --> 2559.1600000000003
great I like it when it doesn't hit the

2555.04 --> 2559.16
wall anymore here because then it gets

2562.599 --> 2567.48
cooler and the mint plant really took a

2565.24 --> 2570.4799999999996
pounding from all the freezing by the

2567.48 --> 2572.48
way but it still seems to be alive but

2570.48 --> 2576.76
it's like lost

2572.48 --> 2579.52
like 80% of its leaves

2576.76 --> 2579.5200000000004
oh brownish

2580.92 --> 2586.6800000000003
shriveled very curious though if like

2583.319 --> 2589.2
how it will recover from this during

2586.68 --> 2592.52
Springtime curious to see what how it

2589.2 --> 2592.52
will like grow out of

2597.64 --> 2600.64
it

2605.079 --> 2608.079
what

2612.079 --> 2619.079
just what are you guys talking

2615.76 --> 2619.079
about tell

2623.24 --> 2628.4799999999996
me what the hell it's just another

2625.64 --> 2628.48
rainbow what is

2635.079 --> 2638.7200000000003
that

2637.16 --> 2641.72
music that

2638.72 --> 2641.72
was

2665.0 --> 2668.0
okay

2669.88 --> 2672.88
oh

2674.28 --> 2680.1600000000003
okay right so who wants to talk about

2677.16 --> 2683.92
Flat Earth or

2680.16 --> 2683.92
physics I'm all up for

2694.96 --> 2697.96
it

2698.8 --> 2706.48
prayers I see what you mean in the gift

2701.839 --> 2706.48
and go yeah

2724.88 --> 2727.88
apparently

2728.8 --> 2738.4
but uh yeah yeah the actual support is

2732.92 --> 2738.4
uh it's not really happening that

2754.88 --> 2757.88
much

2762.48 --> 2765.52
right so yeah I guess I'm not going to

2764.079 --> 2767.92
go back to the Flat Earth debates

2765.52 --> 2767.92
anytime

2769.7 --> 2775.2
[Music]

2772.0 --> 2779.72
soon right and if you want that or if

2775.2 --> 2779.72
they want that well you know what to

2784.8 --> 2787.8
do

2814.8 --> 2817.8
for

2823.83 --> 2834.3089999999997
[Applause]

2844.72 --> 2847.72
for

2849.48 --> 2853.319
oh you only noticed that

2851.72 --> 2856.319
now

2853.319 --> 2856.319
really

2858.52 --> 2862.92
yeah I mean it's all just a joke to

2861.0 --> 2865.92
these guys all of

2862.92 --> 2865.92
it

2872.8 --> 2880.319
right sub numbers going up

2877.0 --> 2885.359
[ __ ] absolute hor

2880.319 --> 2885.359
[ __ ] sub numbers going up yeah it's only

2886.64 --> 2891.0789999999997
because I don't even think that's really

2896.96 --> 2903.119
natural I think that as soon as I would

2900.119 --> 2905.28
like rejoin Nathan at some point I think

2903.119 --> 2907.2000000000003
it's probably going to go down again so

2905.28 --> 2910.8
it's it's just there

2907.2 --> 2916.68
to I really think that there's a a big

2910.8 --> 2916.6800000000003
effort to keep Nathan and me apart our

2916.72 --> 2921.24
activities I think that we have being

2918.839 --> 2924.359
seen as a a Duo that's

2921.24 --> 2927.4399999999996
like with because of our different

2924.359 --> 2930.5989999999997
talents that we are like very dangerous

2927.44 --> 2933.28
together for the

2930.599 --> 2935.44
world I think that like half the world's

2933.28 --> 2937.28
just trying to keep us apart really like

2935.44 --> 2940.4
that

2937.28 --> 2940.4
but yeah I

2942.88 --> 2945.88
mean

2964.52 --> 2967.52
whatever

2970.44 --> 2975.0
right but hey I'll focus on my channel

2972.799 --> 2978.319
sure I mean but like what what are we

2975.0 --> 2980.359
going to do then though yeah does that

2978.319 --> 2981.5589999999997
mean that none of you want to talk about

2980.359 --> 2985.119
Flat Earth

2981.559 --> 2987.0
anymore just done with it you want me to

2985.119 --> 2991.079
remove the Flat Earth from the early

2987.0 --> 2991.079
bird title let's

2992.28 --> 2997.52
see let's see if it was always just

2994.64 --> 2997.52
about that

3006.28 --> 3011.76
right I'm sure there's people out there

3008.0 --> 3013.92
that love to have me on the internet as

3011.76 --> 3016.599
long as I just don't talk about anything

3013.92 --> 3016.599
that I talk

3017.04 --> 3020.92
about especially Flat

3024.44 --> 3027.799
Earth

3026.079 --> 3031.92
shut up

3027.799 --> 3031.92
duper what a question is

3044.04 --> 3050.079
that I always aim to improve it's not

3046.88 --> 3053.559
bound by any year I am always improving

3050.079 --> 3053.559
myself I'm always doing that

3054.44 --> 3057.44
duper

3083.4 --> 3088.1600000000003
eclectic chat that's far with yeah sure

3086.0 --> 3088.16
why

3114.359 --> 3117.359
not

3144.28 --> 3147.28
for

3148.04 --> 3155.839
okay Jo thanks I

3150.64 --> 3155.839
guess on my mind what's on my mind yeah

3166.88 --> 3171.1600000000003
sure cryptography

3174.24 --> 3177.24
okay

3201.04 --> 3206.44
well I'm getting more interested in

3202.72 --> 3209.5989999999997
certain historical figures

3206.44 --> 3209.599
that's what I'm more interested

3211.0 --> 3214.0
in

3214.119 --> 3220.28
p salasi and all more of these figures

3217.799 --> 3223.359
I'm very interested in in all these

3220.28 --> 3227.7200000000003
figures that have basically fought

3223.359 --> 3227.72
communism I'm very interested in

3232.28 --> 3238.3590000000004
those countries that had to like resist

3235.64 --> 3242.2799999999997
it and that might have even Fallen under

3238.359 --> 3242.2799999999997
it right but at least they

3243.64 --> 3248.5989999999997
tried and they're now all being oh he

3246.079 --> 3252.28
was so autocratic yeah what the [ __ ] you

3248.599 --> 3252.28
expect it's freaking communism

3254.839 --> 3258.92
dude probably wasn't hard

3262.52 --> 3270.48
enough but I mean it did like into very

3266.48 --> 3274.119
typical like Financial class divide and

3270.48 --> 3274.119
that is just universally

3277.96 --> 3283.48
problematic right to to keep everybody

3280.799 --> 3287.559
poor so they they

3283.48 --> 3287.559
can't like do anything about

3288.0 --> 3295.44
it that's not good position to be so I

3293.04 --> 3299.04
mean in the end it all just is kind of

3295.44 --> 3299.04
messed up for

3299.64 --> 3304.16
him but it's overall just a very

3302.4 --> 3307.0
interesting

3304.16 --> 3311.0
figure I had no idea of this history

3307.0 --> 3311.0
like between Italy and

3324.0 --> 3327.0
Ethiopia

3333.24 --> 3337.9599999999996
public private key of

3354.0 --> 3357.0
okay

3383.92 --> 3386.92
h

3409.48 --> 3413.88
all right but it seems to like not

3411.48 --> 3416.0
really catch your attention

3413.88 --> 3421.44
so

3416.0 --> 3421.44
oh my God duper do you really have to do

3421.559 --> 3428.799
this would you mind not not like trying

3425.96 --> 3432.2400000000002
to organize my life right now dupons

3428.799 --> 3432.24
would you mind just not doing

3443.16 --> 3449.72
that yeah side jump so cute but I

3446.839 --> 3453.16
mean I have to I would have to do it

3449.72 --> 3456.9599999999996
black though and I

3453.16 --> 3456.96
yeah otherwise there's no

3461.96 --> 3465.96
point I know you're just trying to but

3464.28 --> 3469.28
could you just not do that today I'm

3465.96 --> 3470.96
just trying to recover

3469.28 --> 3474.2000000000003
still

3470.96 --> 3477.76
right please don't get all in my

3474.2 --> 3477.7599999999998
business all all of a sudden

3481.0 --> 3488.599
please I'm trying to have a a subject

3484.839 --> 3491.359
conversation not just more therapy on

3488.599 --> 3495.319
how I going to fix my life yeah this not

3491.359 --> 3495.319
the fix my life show

3503.72 --> 3506.72
please

3516.2 --> 3519.5589999999997
yeah stop saying it

3522.0 --> 3527.64
duper I want to talk about subjects not

3525.319 --> 3529.88
oh what can we do to fix AR win's life

3527.64 --> 3529.8799999999997
yeah

3533.72 --> 3536.72
thanks

3537.039 --> 3539.96
what are we going to talk

3540.2 --> 3545.5989999999997
about what about Flat Earth do you still

3543.0 --> 3545.599
not

3549.44 --> 3553.559
understand

3550.96 --> 3555.799
or do you understand by now I mean

3553.559 --> 3558.0
you've been following for a

3555.799 --> 3559.64
while still remember in the beginning

3558.0 --> 3561.319
you had all

3559.64 --> 3563.64
these

3561.319 --> 3566.64
questions that I think I

3563.64 --> 3566.64
answered

3567.2 --> 3570.8799999999997
mostly is there any

3583.839 --> 3590.52
left does everybody here understand like

3588.64 --> 3594.68
the the

3590.52 --> 3597.96
conceptions of Flat Earth of my modeling

3594.68 --> 3600.96
my attempts to figure out the

3597.96 --> 3600.96
layout

3601.24 --> 3608.7599999999998
right concept of the North Pole not

3605.52 --> 3610.92
being a point that there's a magnetic

3608.76 --> 3615.96
Point

3610.92 --> 3615.96
perhaps but not like a Celestial

3620.799 --> 3626.559
Point like that Polaris would B

3623.4 --> 3628.52
basically be above you at that on a line

3626.559 --> 3629.92
like over the line you could just walk

3628.52 --> 3634.0389999999998
the line and

3629.92 --> 3636.559
see it spinning around you faster right

3634.039 --> 3639.76
or slower you go the other

3636.559 --> 3642.1600000000003
direction east north and you're not

3639.76 --> 3644.28
moving in a circle you're moving over a

3642.16 --> 3646.24
straight line and Polaris would be right

3644.28 --> 3649.2000000000003
above you if that's even possible to

3646.24 --> 3652.0789999999997
like reach that because it might be that

3649.2 --> 3656.52
Polaris literally starts shifting slower

3652.079 --> 3656.52
and slower the further you would

3657.68 --> 3662.9199999999996
the more you draw near the GP point of

3660.24 --> 3665.5989999999997
it you might not be able to reach a

3662.92 --> 3669.039
perfect GP point with

3665.599 --> 3672.319
Polaris but if you do then I'm convinced

3669.039 --> 3675.119
depending though on the layout of the

3672.319 --> 3678.5589999999997
realm that it you could

3675.119 --> 3681.359
walk the latitude line as it were a

3678.559 --> 3683.44
straight line and have Polaris stay

3681.359 --> 3686.44
right above

3683.44 --> 3686.44
you

3695.88 --> 3700.599
right and by the way that observation if

3698.839 --> 3703.599
that would actually happen very

3700.599 --> 3706.319
fascinating somebody could actually test

3703.599 --> 3708.52
that but I mean if that were to happen

3706.319 --> 3711.5589999999997
then of course like the whole notion of

3708.52 --> 3713.359
a heliocentric system surrounding

3711.559 --> 3715.2000000000003
supposed Globe Earth yeah that's not

3713.359 --> 3718.4
really going to work out

3715.2 --> 3724.7599999999998
if you're walking at a very long

3718.4 --> 3724.76
line and the star just stays right above

3736.279 --> 3740.44
you PO is hardly

3743.359 --> 3746.359
moves

3747.0 --> 3752.16
yeah but if you walk North Celestial

3749.359 --> 3755.48
North then Polaris will go to where it's

3752.16 --> 3758.7599999999998
going to be almost right above

3755.48 --> 3758.76
you but

3760.16 --> 3766.1189999999997
then according to the dis map logic and

3763.16 --> 3768.0789999999997
to the globe map logic when you then

3766.119 --> 3772.119
reach Polaris it's like wherever you go

3768.079 --> 3772.119
you're going to go away from

3773.359 --> 3776.96
Polaris

3775.079 --> 3781.599
and I don't think that happens I think

3776.96 --> 3784.52
that when you reach it as a GP that it

3781.599 --> 3787.52
you can go east and west depending on

3784.52 --> 3790.079
how wide the realm spans at that

3787.52 --> 3791.559
latitude and just have it stay right

3790.079 --> 3794.039
above

3791.559 --> 3798.6400000000003
you hey

3794.039 --> 3801.5200000000004
clammy you're doing well yeah I'm I'm

3798.64 --> 3803.279
okay I'm not completely fully recovered

3801.52 --> 3806.279
but I'm getting

3803.279 --> 3806.279
there

3822.96 --> 3829.0
right anyhow the whole Polaris thing is

3826.0 --> 3829.0
just interesting to

3833.279 --> 3836.279
me

3840.24 --> 3845.8799999999997
like that region what is it how wide is

3843.559 --> 3850.1600000000003
it how wide is it east to

3845.88 --> 3850.1600000000003
west it might actually be quite

3851.039 --> 3854.039
short

3854.119 --> 3861.44
but yeah there's so many possibilities

3857.039 --> 3861.44
right like it might actually be

3861.48 --> 3867.2400000000002
that they try to basically get it GP

3865.4 --> 3869.76
above

3867.24 --> 3872.64
you but then most of the times if you

3869.76 --> 3875.5200000000004
then continue on you just like almost

3872.64 --> 3878.68
like deflect you go back

3875.52 --> 3880.279
south but if you hit it exactly at a

3878.68 --> 3883.48
very specific

3880.279 --> 3885.4
angle that you might like find the way

3883.48 --> 3888.76
through the loop there might be like

3885.4 --> 3892.4
Beyond Polaris a loop tunnel that's very

3888.76 --> 3893.6400000000003
tight and that you have to hit exactly

3892.4 --> 3896.799
at the right angle because if you're

3893.64 --> 3899.52
hitting off you literally are yeah

3896.799 --> 3902.16
through the loop you go

3899.52 --> 3904.559
back if you hit it exactly the right

3902.16 --> 3906.2
angle then suddenly you go through and

3904.559 --> 3908.6400000000003
then Polaris might

3906.2 --> 3912.5989999999997
like go behind

3908.64 --> 3914.64
you while potentially even a new Demi

3912.599 --> 3918.039
spere of stars might appear at the

3914.64 --> 3918.0389999999998
Horizon further

3918.16 --> 3923.7599999999998
north like

3920.72 --> 3925.9599999999996
another Demi spere of stars might become

3923.76 --> 3928.4
visible that that's literally impossible

3925.96 --> 3931.839
to see within our

3928.4 --> 3935.599
realm you could only see that beyond the

3931.839 --> 3935.599
north if he could get

3940.44 --> 3945.92
there right so these are like

3942.559 --> 3949.079
interesting ideas about it that that

3945.92 --> 3949.079
yeah that could very well

3953.079 --> 3956.079
be

3962.16 --> 3969.7599999999998
right but the idea that it's not very

3965.599 --> 3972.3590000000004
likely that like the north the anti

3969.76 --> 3975.4
equator at the North would be the same

3972.359 --> 3977.7599999999998
length as the

3975.4 --> 3981.64
equator because then well there would be

3977.76 --> 3983.4
so much room there to like go beyond one

3981.64 --> 3984.52
way or another there would just be a lot

3983.4 --> 3988.1600000000003
of room

3984.52 --> 3988.16
and that seems

3988.68 --> 3993.0
unlikely but maybe maybe it is but I

3991.92 --> 3995.799
think

3993.0 --> 3998.599
that even within the looping

3995.799 --> 4003.079
system the North and potentially the

3998.599 --> 4003.079
South are tighter than at the

4006.039 --> 4009.599
equator but still

4013.0 --> 4018.88
flat

4015.96 --> 4020.88
like I've seen maps in the past like in

4018.88 --> 4023.48
books and all that where the map

4020.88 --> 4026.119
wouldn't be like a perfect rectangle but

4023.48 --> 4029.0
it would like be supposedly the glob

4026.119 --> 4031.92
projection right where it's like crammed

4029.0 --> 4034.599
in the North and the South a bit well

4031.92 --> 4036.2000000000003
maybe that is literally it that as a

4034.599 --> 4040.599
flat plane with the

4036.2 --> 4043.0389999999998
loop there at those edges like it Loops

4040.599 --> 4045.0
in So at the North and the South there

4043.039 --> 4046.4
would be

4045.0 --> 4049.68
less

4046.4 --> 4052.2000000000003
space going over that same

4049.68 --> 4054.1189999999997
latitude but it's still

4052.2 --> 4057.279
interconnected and it's

4054.119 --> 4059.6400000000003
flat just all kind of like a bit

4057.279 --> 4062.52
counterintuitive and like yeah that

4059.64 --> 4064.4
really would play into the suggestion of

4062.52 --> 4067.0389999999998
like who you could think of it as a ball

4064.4 --> 4070.96
really helps when you do that makes more

4067.039 --> 4070.96
sense that way but it isn't though it's

4072.92 --> 4075.92
flat

4078.359 --> 4084.24
how elevation angles are

4080.88 --> 4084.2400000000002
converted to a

4084.68 --> 4090.45
globe yeah well they're not elevation

4087.039 --> 4093.5600000000004
angles are not it's

4090.45 --> 4093.56
[Music]

4095.12 --> 4103.2789999999995
just I use the celestial

4099.08 --> 4105.64
sphere to to like map that out the GPS

4103.279 --> 4111.88
of everything everywhere and then they

4105.64 --> 4114.6
draw the flat plane map parallel to

4111.88 --> 4116.52
that so it's like the maps are Globe

4114.6 --> 4119.120000000001
projections because they're based on the

4116.52 --> 4119.120000000001
celestial

4120.0 --> 4124.359
sphere that's that's what's that's how

4122.799 --> 4128.12
they made

4124.359 --> 4131.120000000001
it right it's Celestial navigation the

4128.12 --> 4132.799
celestial lights are presented to us

4131.12 --> 4135.48
like a a

4132.799 --> 4138.719
demiere

4135.48 --> 4142.2789999999995
so that's how the maps were

4138.719 --> 4145.199
created but it was based off that the

4142.279 --> 4147.2390000000005
celestial Demis spere versus a flat

4145.199 --> 4150.3189999999995
plane to get those elevation angles and

4147.239 --> 4150.3189999999995
everything to get it all

4150.799 --> 4158.239
consistent and then Maps were drawn to

4154.759 --> 4161.799
basically lay that out and Yeah there

4158.239 --> 4163.839
they would be technically spherical

4161.799 --> 4167.199
projections but that's because it's

4163.839 --> 4169.96
based of the apparent sphere of the

4167.199 --> 4173.239
celestials not because the Earth is a

4169.96 --> 4173.2390000000005
sphere it's

4192.719 --> 4197.92
flat

4195.12 --> 4199.199
right so yeah duper I mean I hope that's

4197.92 --> 4202.08
clear

4199.199 --> 4206.48
like they don't do anything with the

4202.08 --> 4208.64
elevation angles they just have it they

4206.48 --> 4210.36
use the flat plane with those angles and

4208.64 --> 4213.719
the

4210.36 --> 4216.679
celestial GP positions they lay it out

4213.719 --> 4218.199
and then they just after they've done

4216.679 --> 4221.159
that after they mapped it out on the

4218.199 --> 4224.199
flat plane that's when they then say Oh

4221.159 --> 4226.36
yeah and that flat plane that we used

4224.199 --> 4229.12
to map all of this out we're going to

4226.36 --> 4232.48
just assume it's a sphere

4229.12 --> 4232.48
underneath all of

4235.0 --> 4240.719
it and then they don't draw consequences

4238.52 --> 4242.4800000000005
to it like hey oh well then you should

4240.719 --> 4245.4
probably see

4242.48 --> 4248.48
stars below eye level when you go higher

4245.4 --> 4251.759999999999
up but you don't you never do they move

4248.48 --> 4254.12
with you perfectly right so they just

4251.76 --> 4256.280000000001
like they just make you presupposed

4254.12 --> 4258.76
that's that it was all a sphere

4256.28 --> 4263.0
underneath that measured flat plane and

4258.76 --> 4267.56
then leave it open and leave you to not

4263.0 --> 4271.239
draw logical consequences of that

4267.56 --> 4271.2390000000005
claim that's how they do

4282.56 --> 4285.56
it

4308.96 --> 4312.92
I hope that helps

4310.48 --> 4316.12
duper are you getting it a bit better

4312.92 --> 4316.12
now are you you need more

4338.8 --> 4345.4800000000005
explanation and charts

4342.48 --> 4345.48
h

4350.88 --> 4354.05
[Applause]

4368.84 --> 4371.84
okay

4372.44 --> 4375.44
okay

4402.36 --> 4405.36
h

4406.04 --> 4409.92
H okay that's

4410.0 --> 4416.4
interesting right so a chart is like the

4414.44 --> 4418.719
full ukian

4416.4 --> 4422.0
information with that includes Heights

4418.719 --> 4424.88
and everything and maps are just 2D

4422.0 --> 4427.84
projection of the

4424.88 --> 4430.52
topography that's what I'm getting from

4427.84 --> 4430.52
that Google

4432.36 --> 4435.36
search

4462.28 --> 4465.28
am

4469.48 --> 4474.239
well there are also articles here that

4471.32 --> 4477.36
say that's no difference between maps

4474.239 --> 4477.36
and charts that's kind of

4489.92 --> 4496.4800000000005
funny okay you wanted to make a point

4492.56 --> 4496.4800000000005
with that diver d Navy

4522.199 --> 4525.199
vet

4550.04 --> 4554.48
wow okay well I'll just try to come up

4552.76 --> 4560.280000000001
with something else then if it's just

4554.48 --> 4560.28
one one sentence drop and then walk away

4560.32 --> 4563.32
okay

4570.8 --> 4576.639
fine in the

4573.199 --> 4578.879999999999
meantime freaking climate change idiots

4576.639 --> 4580.4400000000005
are coming up with the new political

4578.88 --> 4583.639
jargon word that they're going to be

4580.44 --> 4587.04
using EOS side

4583.639 --> 4590.96
it's like oh no how dare you perform

4587.04 --> 4594.8
activities that actually enable you to

4590.96 --> 4594.8
survive that's EOS

4595.84 --> 4604.679
side yeah ridiculous it's all commun is

4599.92 --> 4604.679
garbage they all need to be stacked in

4607.12 --> 4612.48
ovens

4609.8 --> 4614.56
really I think that they just need to

4612.48 --> 4619.879999999999
die for their

4614.56 --> 4622.4800000000005
religion and and like do it

4619.88 --> 4625.32
yeah actually fall through on your own

4622.48 --> 4627.32
beliefs starting with yourself I think

4625.32 --> 4630.32
that's what they should be doing or

4627.32 --> 4634.639
maybe should have a Little Help from us

4630.32 --> 4634.639
to achieve that

4635.719 --> 4642.12
H right so

4638.4 --> 4645.0
yeah nautical navigational charts so

4642.12 --> 4645.0
what what is with that

4647.12 --> 4650.719
why why did you ask me to Google

4672.0 --> 4675.0
that

4680.32 --> 4685.96
okay the response time here in the chat

4682.32 --> 4687.88
is like really starting to suck guys are

4685.96 --> 4689.84
you all just doing completely different

4687.88 --> 4691.679
things is this now like oh I'm just

4689.84 --> 4693.88
having early bird in the background

4691.679 --> 4697.56
because what the hell am I going to even

4693.88 --> 4697.56
talk about like

4701.92 --> 4704.92
this

4731.92 --> 4734.92
for

4753.239 --> 4759.678999999999
okay I'm G to run out the show because

4755.8 --> 4762.08
nobody gives a [ __ ] apparently here fine

4759.679 --> 4764.639
then I'll just round out thanks everyone

4762.08 --> 4766.159
for coming hope you like this show if

4764.639 --> 4768.88
you did then please don't forget to

4766.159 --> 4770.879999999999
rogans it up and if you have oh now

4768.88 --> 4773.4800000000005
somebody says

4770.88 --> 4775.96
something

4773.48 --> 4777.879999999999
ah what's wrong with flat Earth as a

4775.96 --> 4779.8
topic I don't know what's wrong with

4777.88 --> 4782.0
flat Earth as a topic I wanted to talk

4779.8 --> 4786.159000000001
about it and then just nobody says

4782.0 --> 4788.56
anything for minutes on end yeah that's

4786.159 --> 4788.5599999999995
not a

4790.52 --> 4795.4400000000005
show and I don't need to continue

4792.8 --> 4798.96
continually talk about my freaking life

4795.44 --> 4801.839999999999
I want to talk about other

4798.96 --> 4803.719
subjects like Flat Earth and maps and

4801.84 --> 4806.88
maybe a little bit of History here and

4803.719 --> 4810.52
there and I try to like roll out

4806.88 --> 4813.6
subjects not one [ __ ] word of

4810.52 --> 4816.0
reference from anyone in the chat about

4813.6 --> 4818.56
anything I brought up because you don't

4816.0 --> 4821.32
give a [ __ ] apparently about these

4818.56 --> 4823.56
things just more interested in oh can

4821.32 --> 4826.32
you get a job

4823.56 --> 4830.04
or oh look at this thing look at this

4826.32 --> 4832.04
thing oh Maps charts oh that's cute

4830.04 --> 4834.12
what's the point what do you want to

4832.04 --> 4837.56
talk about why did you bring it up it's

4834.12 --> 4839.84
interesting now what what now what now

4837.56 --> 4839.84
with

4845.28 --> 4850.28
that blame the yeah blame the [ __ ]

4851.719 --> 4854.719
audience

4858.52 --> 4866.120000000001
I mean went well right went very well

4862.239 --> 4868.919999999999
that first hour very very

4866.12 --> 4873.639
well and then

4868.92 --> 4875.8
subsequently there's like breaks of four

4873.639 --> 4878.36
five minutes between every single

4875.8 --> 4880.0
[ __ ] comment you better damn believe

4878.36 --> 4880.88
it I'm going to blame that on the

4880.0 --> 4884.0
[ __ ]

4880.88 --> 4886.4800000000005
audience okay

4884.0 --> 4888.159
that's you not saying anything for four

4886.48 --> 4894.0
or five minutes

4888.159 --> 4894.0
straight separately from each other okay

4894.28 --> 4898.5599999999995
yeah if you bring something up then what

4897.6 --> 4900.6
is the

4898.56 --> 4903.88
point if you're not going to actually

4900.6 --> 4903.88
have a conversation about

4909.08 --> 4914.639
it from Verge going north or south

4923.92 --> 4931.56
okay I'm sure nobody gets lost in the

4927.239 --> 4934.839999999999
South Pacific then sure they

4931.56 --> 4937.159000000001
don't yeah so these nautical charts is

4934.84 --> 4937.159000000001
that's

4941.56 --> 4944.56
cute

4951.0 --> 4955.08
are you trying to claim that that we

4953.56 --> 4958.0
live on a

4955.08 --> 4959.88
globe diver are you saying we live on a

4958.0 --> 4962.719
globe because the nautical

4959.88 --> 4965.84
charts with their latitude lines

4962.719 --> 4968.32
converge at the North and the South is

4965.84 --> 4968.32
that what you're

4969.32 --> 4975.08
saying cuz I'm pretty sure you can't

4971.4 --> 4978.759999999999
even get the angle Les to any of it

4975.08 --> 4982.08
can't establish longitudinal

4978.76 --> 4985.76
lines without having a flat Baseline to

4982.08 --> 4990.5599999999995
measure that off and then

4985.76 --> 4990.56
create that map or the chart if you

4992.639 --> 4999.6
will so how does that work on a flat

4995.8 --> 5002.08
Earth uh well you measure it off a flat

4999.6 --> 5003.56
plane and then you put it together and

5002.08 --> 5005.159
hey

5003.56 --> 5007.120000000001
the world's surface is kind of

5005.159 --> 5010.159
mysterious

5007.12 --> 5013.599999999999
right space may not be entirely

5010.159 --> 5017.48
linear it's definitely flat

5013.6 --> 5020.2390000000005
though and yeah maybe it does converge a

5017.48 --> 5021.12
bit north and south as I said like it

5020.239 --> 5024.44
could

5021.12 --> 5029.76
be like going Tighter and then going

5024.44 --> 5029.759999999999
wider Beyond it if there is a

5031.48 --> 5036.678999999999
Beyond

5034.0 --> 5039.04
it does seem like there's

5036.679 --> 5042.76
more room at the

5039.04 --> 5045.0
equator as there is at the North or the

5042.76 --> 5046.639
South although the south is that's in

5045.0 --> 5049.44
dispute there's a lot of people that

5046.639 --> 5053.639
dispute that entirely they think that it

5049.44 --> 5056.04
surrounds us like an ice

5053.639 --> 5059.4800000000005
wall although it seems like in that

5056.04 --> 5062.76
projection they just like kind of widen

5059.48 --> 5064.36
it up and flatten it in in that disc

5062.76 --> 5068.159000000001
projection

5064.36 --> 5068.159
so I don't really see

5091.36 --> 5097.04
it

5094.239 --> 5099.959999999999
wow okay di then na I didn't know you

5097.04 --> 5101.84
were just a full-blown balart I didn't

5099.96 --> 5104.28
know that yet I I noticed that you had

5101.84 --> 5106.0
some weird objections here and there but

5104.28 --> 5109.44
this is [ __ ]

5106.0 --> 5111.48
[ __ ] yeah all your years of training

5109.44 --> 5112.96
apparently didn't make you realize that

5111.48 --> 5115.32
whenever you're going to try to take an

5112.96 --> 5117.4
angle to the stars in order to do any

5115.32 --> 5119.88
form of navigation you're going to have

5117.4 --> 5123.08
to do it off a flat plane with a

5119.88 --> 5126.4400000000005
baseline yeah elevation angle

5123.08 --> 5128.32
all that yeah pretty [ __ ] dumb to say

5126.44 --> 5131.919999999999
something like this at this point like

5128.32 --> 5135.5599999999995
really [ __ ] dumb Bal tarded level

5131.92 --> 5138.04
dumb siman Dan fight the Flat Earth

5135.56 --> 5138.04
level

5139.52 --> 5144.4400000000005
dumb to say that after all this so

5142.48 --> 5147.239
you've been trained to be a [ __ ]

5144.44 --> 5151.28
ballart measuring angles of a flat plane

5147.239 --> 5154.28
and you're too dumb to realize it holy

5151.28 --> 5154.28
[ __ ]

5171.6 --> 5182.4400000000005
Earth is flat my friend you're not on a

5177.32 --> 5187.4
ball it's flat everywhere every piece of

5182.44 --> 5189.839999999999
land and ocean is exactly parallel to

5187.4 --> 5192.28
every other piece of land and

5189.84 --> 5194.96
ocean I don't believe it's flat it's

5192.28 --> 5198.28
measured flat Celestial navigation

5194.96 --> 5201.52
couldn't have worked Maps could not have

5198.28 --> 5205.679
been made charts could not have been

5201.52 --> 5205.679
created without the Earth being

5206.4 --> 5212.159
flat CU you can't then get the angles to

5210.48 --> 5214.44
the Stars you just it don't doesn't

5212.159 --> 5215.44
doesn't work anymore if you're not on a

5214.44 --> 5217.5599999999995
flat

5215.44 --> 5222.0
plane that's the

5217.56 --> 5222.0
point it doesn't work anymore

5222.84 --> 5227.679
then like how are you going to take an

5225.0 --> 5231.84
angle to a star when it's like when you

5227.679 --> 5231.84
just move a little and then the Horizon

5231.96 --> 5235.92
moves like it doesn't

5236.76 --> 5243.1990000000005
work like what is the height that you

5240.159 --> 5246.92
are going to do this cesti measurements

5243.199 --> 5248.04
with when the height literally changes

5246.92 --> 5250.56
the

5248.04 --> 5252.76
angles it changes the angles to the

5250.56 --> 5255.56
Horizon it doesn't

5252.76 --> 5258.159000000001
work the celestial navigation does work

5255.56 --> 5262.1990000000005
it works so perfectly you can even do it

5258.159 --> 5267.04
in an airplane you know why

5262.199 --> 5270.4
because the angles to the Stars don't

5267.04 --> 5274.159
change with

5270.4 --> 5277.04
height yeah they don't change with

5274.159 --> 5280.199
height something that is absolutely

5277.04 --> 5282.92
impossible on a globe with all the

5280.199 --> 5287.119
claims they have about the celestial

5282.92 --> 5290.04
bodies okay but in reality the angles to

5287.119 --> 5292.719
the Stars don't change with

5290.04 --> 5295.04
height yeah calling normal people

5292.719 --> 5296.76
retards yeah well that's not normal it's

5295.04 --> 5298.88
just [ __ ] and they think they're

5296.76 --> 5302.08
normal because everybody

5298.88 --> 5304.28
else says it's like that or doesn't

5302.08 --> 5307.639
contested right it's on the television

5304.28 --> 5311.04
you see a globe on the news yeah they're

5307.639 --> 5311.04
retards you're a

5311.119 --> 5316.199
[ __ ] you must disagree well I don't

5314.08 --> 5319.639
give a [ __ ] if you disagree you're just

5316.199 --> 5322.119
wrong and a Ballard I never knew that

5319.639 --> 5324.76
about you David

5322.119 --> 5327.839999999999
that surprised I hadn't even picked up

5324.76 --> 5327.84
on that as

5331.0 --> 5334.0
much

5344.28 --> 5348.96
you almost disagree I don't give a [ __ ]

5346.52 --> 5352.4800000000005
you're wrong you're just

5348.96 --> 5355.119
wrong yeah it's a fact when you go up

5352.48 --> 5358.199
the angles to the Stars don't change

5355.119 --> 5361.639
that's a fact that's finished for you

5358.199 --> 5363.04
then not a globe yeah that can't work on

5361.639 --> 5364.52
a globe

5363.04 --> 5366.719
yeah if you think you're on a globe you

5364.52 --> 5368.679
go up guess what all those Ang to the

5366.719 --> 5370.4800000000005
Stars oh they're godamn going to change

5368.679 --> 5374.639
all over the place you're suddenly going

5370.48 --> 5377.159
to see stars underneath your height of

5374.639 --> 5378.679
eye but you don't you never do it

5377.159 --> 5381.48
doesn't work doesn't matter how high up

5378.679 --> 5384.04
you go the angles don't change they

5381.48 --> 5385.959999999999
don't change and no new stars appear

5384.04 --> 5388.44
beneath your

5385.96 --> 5392.28
sight because the Earth is flat and the

5388.44 --> 5394.919999999999
celestial lights are like not actually

5392.28 --> 5397.719
light emitting objects at a vast

5394.92 --> 5400.32
distance they're Celestial lights and

5397.719 --> 5402.56
what they even are is mysterious but we

5400.32 --> 5405.96
can definitely not Trace actual

5402.56 --> 5408.92
positions to any of them we can

5405.96 --> 5411.4
establish the GP where they are right

5408.92 --> 5415.28
above us over the Flat Earth that's what

5411.4 --> 5415.28
we can absolutely establish

5415.76 --> 5420.6
perfectly have you ever get have you

5418.48 --> 5422.44
ever

5420.6 --> 5424.400000000001
sh they

5422.44 --> 5426.44
have you ever walked into a

5424.4 --> 5429.28
store you

5426.44 --> 5431.0
ever like what what does that have to do

5429.28 --> 5432.44
with anything have you ever done this

5431.0 --> 5433.76
have you ever done that everything I

5432.44 --> 5437.239
said is

5433.76 --> 5439.4400000000005
fact I don't have to do any of that to

5437.239 --> 5442.718999999999
know that what I just described to you

5439.44 --> 5446.799999999999
is fact when you go

5442.719 --> 5449.4800000000005
up Stars stay at the exact same angular

5446.8 --> 5453.119000000001
position no matter how high you go

5449.48 --> 5456.28
that's a fact it's over yeah yeah me not

5453.119 --> 5459.799999999999
performing navigation out there has

5456.28 --> 5463.239
absolutely no relevance to that

5459.8 --> 5466.0
fact empirical fact that always works

5463.239 --> 5468.879999999999
like that every

5466.0 --> 5473.239
time yeah that's

5468.88 --> 5475.08
why airplanes that navigate up there

5473.239 --> 5476.5199999999995
with Celestial navigation sometimes to

5475.08 --> 5480.239
orient themselves yeah that's why they

5476.52 --> 5482.639
use the exact same star Maps they use

5480.239 --> 5486.28
the same Maps

5482.639 --> 5489.4800000000005
why because they can because the height

5486.28 --> 5492.5199999999995
doesn't matter to the celestial Maps

5489.48 --> 5495.36
yeah it works perfectly with any

5492.52 --> 5497.8
height that makes absolutely no sense if

5495.36 --> 5503.0
you're on a globe because a different

5497.8 --> 5506.28
height would literally be more Globe

5503.0 --> 5506.28
distance and it

5507.28 --> 5516.119
isn't yeah distance is exactly the same

5512.56 --> 5519.280000000001
at ground level and at very high heights

5516.119 --> 5521.44
it's exactly the same distance you know

5519.28 --> 5525.159
why because it's

5521.44 --> 5527.919999999999
flat you have a flat plane the distance

5525.159 --> 5530.44
over that FL flat plane is not going to

5527.92 --> 5532.32
different differentiate down to the

5530.44 --> 5536.119
ground and high above it's going to be

5532.32 --> 5536.119
the exact same distance because it's

5536.56 --> 5543.679
flat

5538.48 --> 5543.678999999999
yeah we don't live on a ball dummy

5551.119 --> 5555.28
ah shove it up your ass

5558.6 --> 5564.2390000000005
[ __ ] shove that Dober fist up your own

5570.639 --> 5573.639
ass

5576.719 --> 5582.4
that's distance to the stars there is no

5579.6 --> 5584.719
distance to the Stars literally there is

5582.4 --> 5589.5599999999995
no distance to the Stars there's only a

5584.719 --> 5590.96
distance to the GP position of stars

5589.56 --> 5594.080000000001
actual

5590.96 --> 5596.6
distance there is none there is no

5594.08 --> 5601.239
actual distance to the Stars there's

5596.6 --> 5604.679
only distance to the GP of the Stars

5601.239 --> 5608.0
where that star is exactly above you on

5604.679 --> 5608.0
Earth at any

5623.199 --> 5630.5599999999995
height oh you sent me PayPal oh okay

5627.08 --> 5633.5199999999995
thank you Sten I

5630.56 --> 5636.92
guess I mean I might be able to help you

5633.52 --> 5638.040000000001
with that very very s silly belief you

5636.92 --> 5640.4800000000005
have

5638.04 --> 5643.5199999999995
though yeah I mean everybody in this

5640.48 --> 5646.839999999999
world is Globe believer at one point or

5643.52 --> 5650.360000000001
another can't hold that against you but

5646.84 --> 5653.28
to still hold on to them as I'm telling

5650.36 --> 5655.839999999999
you facts that absolutely refute the

5653.28 --> 5658.8
possibility of the Earth being a globe

5655.84 --> 5658.8
well that's on

5659.239 --> 5664.32
you what I might be able to get through

5663.36 --> 5668.0
to

5664.32 --> 5668.0
you if you allow

5674.6 --> 5678.8
me all right thank you for

5681.08 --> 5686.719
that five

5683.0 --> 5686.719
bucks five bucks is

5690.48 --> 5693.48
something

5702.199 --> 5708.719
can we break down what is process of

5704.639 --> 5708.719
celestial navigation on the Flat

5710.679 --> 5716.4
Earth what's the

5713.8 --> 5719.360000000001
process

5716.4 --> 5721.96
well you establish the

5719.36 --> 5724.5599999999995
Horizon the angle to the

5721.96 --> 5724.56
star or

5724.96 --> 5731.679
sun uh you have to correct for the

5729.119 --> 5731.679
height of

5732.639 --> 5737.32
I and then you measure the

5742.56 --> 5747.52
angle right because the Horizon is

5744.84 --> 5750.4400000000005
always like slightly above your eyes

5747.52 --> 5752.92
level which is logical because yeah

5750.44 --> 5755.36
you're the hor Horizon is where the

5752.92 --> 5757.32
where is basically the ground in in the

5755.36 --> 5759.36
fastest farthest of

5757.32 --> 5763.199
distances so it's going to always be

5759.36 --> 5763.199
technically slightly above I

5773.0 --> 5776.0
level

5776.56 --> 5783.320000000001
what not here to debate oh

5780.32 --> 5783.32
okay

5810.28 --> 5813.28
sure

5831.44 --> 5836.5199999999995
right but I mean it's not that difficult

5834.4 --> 5839.04
right Rich

5836.52 --> 5843.119000000001
[Music]

5839.04 --> 5845.48
G you just have to like a establish what

5843.119 --> 5849.08
where you are on the celestial

5845.48 --> 5851.199
map like where which GP is closest to

5849.08 --> 5853.44
you and then compare it to

5851.199 --> 5857.4
the the map of the

5853.44 --> 5857.4
land that parallels

5866.92 --> 5873.1990000000005
it if you not 100% sure prop

5877.32 --> 5880.32
what

5883.08 --> 5887.8
okay well when it comes to like

5885.119 --> 5889.679
Celestial navigation instruction manuals

5887.8 --> 5892.599
I mean that's like 10th

5889.679 --> 5895.36
man's specialty but he hasn't been there

5892.599 --> 5895.360000000001
for a while

5896.28 --> 5903.759999999999
so I think he's done videos about that

5900.199 --> 5903.759999999999
at least like present ations on

5913.639 --> 5917.36
fed where's the working flat map they're

5916.48 --> 5920.36
all

5917.36 --> 5922.598999999999
flat all maps are flat it's

5920.36 --> 5924.92
ridiculous it's like oh where's your

5922.599 --> 5928.04
working map that doesn't presuppose it's

5924.92 --> 5930.119
a globe yeah well that's the same it's

5928.04 --> 5933.76
all the same it's all the same

5930.119 --> 5937.719
thing right how were those Maps

5933.76 --> 5941.92
constructed angles to Stars versus a

5937.719 --> 5941.92
flat Baseline like

5942.04 --> 5949.0
done all maps are flat maps all charts

5945.679 --> 5951.119
are flat they're all measured flat can

5949.0 --> 5953.36
only measure it

5951.119 --> 5955.0
because the Earth is flat otherwise you

5953.36 --> 5957.239
wouldn't be able to establish anything

5955.0 --> 5957.239
with

5958.08 --> 5964.5599999999995
it you wouldn't have a flat Baseline to

5960.88 --> 5966.96
get the angles off to get any form of

5964.56 --> 5972.719
consistency that you actually

5966.96 --> 5975.719
require to make a durable consistent

5972.719 --> 5977.4
map that you can navigate and explore

5975.719 --> 5979.28
every time in the same way it's going to

5977.4 --> 5984.5599999999995
be very hard when you don't have that

5979.28 --> 5987.599
flat Baseline that is always so reliably

5984.56 --> 5990.4800000000005
there because the Earth is

5987.599 --> 5992.4400000000005
flat yeah there would not have Celestial

5990.48 --> 5994.759999999999
navigation would have never

5992.44 --> 5997.598999999999
been

5994.76 --> 6000.2390000000005
able would never have become a thing if

5997.599 --> 6000.2390000000005
the Earth was a

6012.96 --> 6017.92
globe measurements you get from measured

6016.239 --> 6019.959999999999
flat

6017.92 --> 6022.0
what yeah Black

6019.96 --> 6024.119
Swan

6022.0 --> 6027.36
it's not a

6024.119 --> 6029.799999999999
globe there's no need to even think of

6027.36 --> 6032.199
it as a globe if it would be so large

6029.8 --> 6034.119000000001
because it's ridiculous at that point

6032.199 --> 6036.4
nothing works anymore yeah so if you

6034.119 --> 6040.719
have a gigantic

6036.4 --> 6042.799999999999
Globe a Jupiter sized Earth in which we

6040.719 --> 6045.32
are just like this little circle on top

6042.8 --> 6049.1990000000005
of that well that's super cute then all

6045.32 --> 6052.28
of celestial all the celestials all that

6049.199 --> 6054.839999999999
doesn't make any damn sense

6052.28 --> 6057.92
yeah that would be like this miniature

6054.84 --> 6057.92
part of a ball

6058.08 --> 6062.96
surrounded by a field of stars that

6060.84 --> 6065.08
literally surround us fully even though

6062.96 --> 6067.119
it's just this very small part on a

6065.08 --> 6069.639
globe makes absolutely no sense

6067.119 --> 6071.719
whatsoever yeah that would still be

6069.639 --> 6074.159000000001
presupposing it's the globe of that

6071.719 --> 6077.88
smaller size based on the

6074.159 --> 6081.839999999999
stars and how they rotate over

6077.88 --> 6085.76
us so it that just doesn't work at

6081.84 --> 6087.88
all it's the globe of that stupid small

6085.76 --> 6090.4800000000005
size or

6087.88 --> 6094.2390000000005
nothing it's the only thing that makes

6090.48 --> 6096.759999999999
any remote sense with like the idea of

6094.239 --> 6099.199
outer space and all that like the rest

6096.76 --> 6102.76
it just doesn't work as soon as you like

6099.199 --> 6106.239
enlarge that Globe it's gone it's all

6102.76 --> 6109.4400000000005
gone doesn't work anymore has to be of

6106.239 --> 6112.199
that size or the stars are not going to

6109.44 --> 6115.28
fit within the the preset position just

6112.199 --> 6115.28
doesn't work any other

6128.48 --> 6138.04
sze measured flat

6132.4 --> 6142.759999999999
yeah well not with a ruler but optically

6138.04 --> 6142.76
definitely massive distance sightings

6145.199 --> 6149.0
yeah well there's only one way that

6146.96 --> 6151.32
could ever happen and that is over a

6149.0 --> 6151.32
flat

6154.84 --> 6161.1990000000005
plane CU on a globe you can never ever

6159.679 --> 6165.0
see those fast

6161.199 --> 6165.0
distances can never be

6165.96 --> 6171.199
possible The Horizon in which would be

6169.159 --> 6174.879999999999
geometric on a globe would always always

6171.199 --> 6177.44
obstruct those things from being visible

6174.88 --> 6178.88
always you would have to go up super

6177.44 --> 6180.5199999999995
high and then everything would look

6178.88 --> 6184.0
completely

6180.52 --> 6186.76
different you would like look out over a

6184.0 --> 6189.92
globe it would look like

6186.76 --> 6189.92
that it

6190.679 --> 6197.599
doesn't Horizon is always flat no matter

6194.199 --> 6199.799999999999
how high you go the Horizon is always

6197.599 --> 6202.04
slightly below eye level no matter how

6199.8 --> 6204.360000000001
high you go

6202.04 --> 6204.36
it's

6204.84 --> 6211.4400000000005
done the Horizon is not geometric it's

6207.639 --> 6211.4400000000005
not a globe it's not that

6226.48 --> 6232.5599999999995
Globe mess what the [ __ ] does that even

6229.36 --> 6236.08
mean aumu she just being really nitpicky

6232.56 --> 6239.080000000001
right now about

6236.08 --> 6239.08
nonsense

6247.48 --> 6251.919999999999
semantics you would love the actual

6249.56 --> 6256.320000000001
measurement test

6251.92 --> 6256.32
well you take a picture of the

6257.639 --> 6262.4800000000005
Horizon you waited for a really clear

6260.04 --> 6264.679
day and then oh you can see certain

6262.48 --> 6267.239
things in the

6264.679 --> 6271.2390000000005
distance that yeah you would never be

6267.239 --> 6271.239
able to see if the Earth was in the

6272.36 --> 6278.159
globe or I'm sorry that you would never

6274.84 --> 6280.400000000001
be able to see if the Earth was a globe

6278.159 --> 6281.5599999999995
right because it would be obstructed by

6280.4 --> 6284.08
The

6281.56 --> 6286.4800000000005
Horizon but it isn't obstructed by The

6284.08 --> 6288.4
Horizon therefore it's not a globe it's

6286.48 --> 6292.199
called The Black Swan

6288.4 --> 6294.759999999999
argument measuring can be taking a

6292.199 --> 6297.5199999999995
picture in that case right you're taking

6294.76 --> 6297.52
an optical

6306.96 --> 6311.8
measurement and the whole point is like

6309.4 --> 6314.28
you don't need to literally put a ruler

6311.8 --> 6316.400000000001
on that that's ridiculous because it's

6314.28 --> 6319.5599999999995
mapped out if you're spotting something

6316.4 --> 6323.36
then you can simply figure out what that

6319.56 --> 6326.4800000000005
is and what this that is based on the

6323.36 --> 6329.08
maps and then you

6326.48 --> 6332.239
know you don't actually have to put a

6329.08 --> 6332.239
ruler in between

6333.239 --> 6337.718999999999
everything you can just figure out what

6335.599 --> 6342.0
it is that you're seeing and then what

6337.719 --> 6344.56
distance that is to you and then know oh

6342.0 --> 6348.239
wow that's far

6344.56 --> 6349.92
away I couldn't see that if if the Earth

6348.239 --> 6353.239
was a globe because the Horizon would

6349.92 --> 6353.2390000000005
obstruct it it and it

6379.4 --> 6382.4
isn't

6385.719 --> 6389.719
all right

6387.599 --> 6391.84
anyhow I think I'm going to round out

6389.719 --> 6391.84
the

6392.88 --> 6399.56
show it's good to have a little bit of

6395.92 --> 6404.28
activity though still in the last half

6399.56 --> 6407.119000000001
hour next time please don't let it

6404.28 --> 6409.4
just don't just all just shut up all of

6407.119 --> 6411.719
a sudden it's really annoying when that

6409.4 --> 6414.5199999999995
happens I'll get Rowdy and I'll just

6411.719 --> 6417.4
like call you out so that you speak up

6414.52 --> 6417.400000000001
again and we can have a

6417.56 --> 6421.88
conversation or an argument if you

6432.4 --> 6438.159
will oh by the way hello John Bernards I

6435.32 --> 6438.159
think I missed you

6439.32 --> 6442.32
earlier

6461.599 --> 6466.4400000000005
what unknown quantity

6469.32 --> 6474.92
no

6471.48 --> 6480.0
that makes no sense a kumus

6474.92 --> 6480.0
like you don't have like what

6480.36 --> 6485.759999999999
Anns the point is that there isn't an

6482.679 --> 6488.719
unknown you just figure out like oh this

6485.76 --> 6493.639
is what I'm seeing because you have

6488.719 --> 6493.639
information that already knows where it

6493.92 --> 6498.0
is copy pasted

6499.239 --> 6502.239
what

6509.76 --> 6515.639
okay right well I guess that comparing

6513.04 --> 6518.719
to other objects if that well yeah well

6515.639 --> 6522.4400000000005
then establishing a distance and then

6518.719 --> 6525.76
comparing it to how far away the Horizon

6522.44 --> 6529.678999999999
should be on a globe well that would fit

6525.76 --> 6532.1990000000005
it then yeah so you measured a thing

6529.679 --> 6534.92
that you're seeing seeing at the Horizon

6532.199 --> 6536.04
then you compare how far distant that is

6534.92 --> 6538.84
on the

6536.04 --> 6540.92
map and then you can figure out through

6538.84 --> 6542.0
Globe geometry like if you should be

6540.92 --> 6546.56
seeing

6542.0 --> 6546.56
that all does very much sound like

6547.04 --> 6552.119
measurement right you're comparing it

6549.119 --> 6552.119
right to Globe

6555.599 --> 6562.119000000001
geometry the measurement from measured

6558.04 --> 6562.119
flat yes it is

6567.28 --> 6573.239
what's the measurement from measured

6569.199 --> 6573.239
flat Horizon not being

6576.639 --> 6581.08
geometric that depending on the

6578.92 --> 6582.76
conditions there basically is no limit

6581.08 --> 6586.719
to how far you can

6582.76 --> 6590.84
see which like infrared camera footage

6586.719 --> 6592.92
has emphasized even more that there

6590.84 --> 6595.96
technically is no

6592.92 --> 6598.84
limit CU it's flat it's just

6595.96 --> 6601.84
that conditions in the air and all that

6598.84 --> 6603.32
they make it eventually impossible to

6601.84 --> 6606.56
see

6603.32 --> 6608.799999999999
further but if you had a big enough lens

6606.56 --> 6612.159000000001
and all that you could technically see

6608.8 --> 6614.159000000001
everything you could see all of it if

6612.159 --> 6616.36
the conditions from the weather don't

6614.159 --> 6618.239
like blur it

6616.36 --> 6622.04
up

6618.239 --> 6622.04
so flat

6624.679 --> 6630.88
like no limitations to distance that is

6628.08 --> 6630.88
absolutely

6630.92 --> 6636.4800000000005
flat yeah if there is a limitation to

6633.92 --> 6639.52
distance to some kind of spicity then

6636.48 --> 6642.4
there would be distinct and

6639.52 --> 6647.2390000000005
permanent limitations to how far you can

6642.4 --> 6649.04
see permanent always there could never

6647.239 --> 6651.36
move Beyond it under any

6649.04 --> 6653.159
circumstance you would just never be

6651.36 --> 6654.639
able to see certain things at a certain

6653.159 --> 6656.598999999999
distance at a certain

6654.639 --> 6659.159000000001
height but we

6656.599 --> 6662.079
do depending on the weather conditions

6659.159 --> 6665.199
there's like incredible

6662.079 --> 6668.5599999999995
distances that we can

6665.199 --> 6668.5599999999995
perceive cuz it's

6676.119 --> 6683.44
flat did the globe clean no it doesn't

6680.52 --> 6685.56
oh that's a bunch of anti flat earthers

6683.44 --> 6688.4
that made up terrestrial refraction hor

6685.56 --> 6690.84
[ __ ] yeah kumu virus it's not even

6688.4 --> 6690.839999999999
official

6695.28 --> 6701.0
claim yeah the Horizon is geometric

6698.599 --> 6702.400000000001
that's why it obstructs things into the

6701.0 --> 6706.719
distance on the

6702.4 --> 6712.598999999999
globe yeah if you it's sometimes you can

6706.719 --> 6712.599
see further well that's and the end

6713.4 --> 6721.079
them you can't see past a curve you

6717.719 --> 6722.599
can't right you can't see what's

6721.079 --> 6724.92
happening on the other side of this

6722.599 --> 6727.2390000000005
toilet roll under any condition you can

6724.92 --> 6729.0
never see what's behind what's happening

6727.239 --> 6733.119
right here behind the toilet you can't

6729.0 --> 6733.119
see it why because it's

6733.4 --> 6737.799999999999
obstructed there's no there's nothing

6735.639 --> 6741.88
that could change that it's

6737.8 --> 6741.88
geometrically obstructed

6748.119 --> 6753.5199999999995
that can't be for what the [ __ ] it's

6751.28 --> 6756.04
called geometry

6753.52 --> 6758.92
dummy show me the claim that says it

6756.04 --> 6762.04
can't be F it's called

6758.92 --> 6764.599
geometry you're just going full barded

6762.04 --> 6764.599
now aren't

6768.84 --> 6771.84
you

6778.119 --> 6783.4
wow I'm not even going to dignify that

6780.36 --> 6785.679
with the response to Kuma virus we got

6783.4 --> 6788.679
like a decade of

6785.679 --> 6790.36
material of a lot of people claiming

6788.679 --> 6793.079
exactly

6790.36 --> 6795.799999999999
that there's still videos out there from

6793.079 --> 6799.04
way back like Bill M the Science Guy and

6795.8 --> 6802.28
all that showing how how it's going over

6799.04 --> 6804.32
the horizon how it's curved yeah say

6802.28 --> 6808.239
yeah how the Horizon is

6804.32 --> 6810.0
geometric it's a geometric curved thing

6808.239 --> 6813.919999999999
that's physically in the

6810.0 --> 6815.92
way yeah if the Earth is a b then the

6813.92 --> 6819.36
Horizon would be geometric it's The

6815.92 --> 6822.639
Logical consequence of having a

6819.36 --> 6822.639
geometry of

6823.119 --> 6831.079
sphere yeah I don't need somebody to

6826.48 --> 6832.839999999999
tell me like hey on a sphere it's like

6831.079 --> 6834.84
the other side of the sphere you can't

6832.84 --> 6836.679
see that because the sphere is in the

6834.84 --> 6839.84
way yeah you don't need to tell me that

6836.679 --> 6843.119
because I am not a brain dead [ __ ]

6839.84 --> 6846.52
that conveniently becomes like a

6843.119 --> 6848.92
sponge like a 10 IQ sponge as soon as

6846.52 --> 6852.360000000001
like their actual belief is totally

6848.92 --> 6855.92
threatened yeah I don't need somebody to

6852.36 --> 6858.679
tell me that because I know basic Common

6855.92 --> 6861.679
Sense akumu

6858.679 --> 6861.679
virus

6863.119 --> 6870.159
sounds like faulty logic to me yes yes

6865.96 --> 6873.639
of course of course that faulty

6870.159 --> 6879.5599999999995
logic it's like you wouldn't expect to

6873.639 --> 6882.719
see geometry on a shape what is

6879.56 --> 6885.8
this like shapes have geometry to them

6882.719 --> 6885.8
that's ridiculous right

6886.239 --> 6891.04
akumu right sometimes you could just see

6889.239 --> 6893.36
behind the the sphere you could just see

6891.04 --> 6895.599
you just look at the at the edge of the

6893.36 --> 6898.4
sphere and you just see behind it this

6895.599 --> 6900.360000000001
totally happens right totally happens

6898.4 --> 6902.96
all the time we can just see around

6900.36 --> 6905.199
corners all the time it's not like that

6902.96 --> 6908.199
corner is geometrically in the way

6905.199 --> 6909.678999999999
obstructing our site just see around the

6908.199 --> 6915.079
corner all the

6909.679 --> 6915.079
time yeah mean geometry doesn't have

6915.679 --> 6920.4800000000005
consequences right you can have any

6918.44 --> 6922.36
shape you could just think of it as flat

6920.48 --> 6924.678999999999
and see from one side of the shape to

6922.36 --> 6927.079
the other in a straight line without

6924.679 --> 6929.159
anything obstructing it because geometry

6927.079 --> 6932.04
doesn't obstruct site

6929.159 --> 6935.5599999999995
apparently I mean that's a faulty logic

6932.04 --> 6935.56
according to akumu virus

6946.44 --> 6951.598999999999
[Applause]

6948.599 --> 6951.599
here

6961.36 --> 6964.4
well we got a title for

6968.44 --> 6975.638999999999
today not make it cl to

6972.44 --> 6978.199
attack I'm supposed to Tech I can do

6975.639 --> 6981.8
whatever the [ __ ] I want aumu I don't

6978.199 --> 6984.759999999999
have to do anything I'm not a

6981.8 --> 6988.400000000001
robot I can go wherever I like this is

6984.76 --> 6991.56
my show I can do it however I feel if I

6988.4 --> 6994.079
feel like talking [ __ ] or just making

6991.56 --> 6996.0
fun of somebody then I do that if I feel

6994.079 --> 6997.639
like getting very technical because I

6996.0 --> 6999.8
feel that's important in the moment then

6997.639 --> 6999.8
I

7004.599 --> 7011.599
do do you think the Horizon would be in

7007.639 --> 7013.1990000000005
the same place L what what no on a globe

7011.599 --> 7015.92
it would not be in the same place

7013.199 --> 7018.598999999999
because the Horizon on the globe is

7015.92 --> 7021.599
geometric that means it's basically not

7018.599 --> 7023.32
like the Horizon that we know that's

7021.599 --> 7025.88
always in the same place that's why it's

7023.32 --> 7028.88
horizontal that's why it's used

7025.88 --> 7031.52
Celestial navigation to establish that

7028.88 --> 7035.400000000001
Baseline so you can get a consistent

7031.52 --> 7036.4400000000005
angle to the Stars right yeah Horizon on

7035.4 --> 7039.96
the Flat

7036.44 --> 7043.5599999999995
Earth not geometric you can see

7039.96 --> 7047.719
as far as site can take you through

7043.56 --> 7051.280000000001
conditions on a globe no no The

7047.719 --> 7054.92
Horizon's position geometrically

7051.28 --> 7058.5199999999995
changes when you change your observation

7054.92 --> 7062.88
height that's just the natural logical

7058.52 --> 7066.320000000001
consequence of globe geometry and seeing

7062.88 --> 7066.32
in relation to Globe

7068.4 --> 7072.92
geometry

7071.04 --> 7075.44
the globe claims that the Horizon you

7072.92 --> 7078.52
see is apparent

7075.44 --> 7081.239
no now that's terrestrial refraction

7078.52 --> 7085.84
anti flat earther [ __ ] like yourself

7081.239 --> 7088.32
that do that yeah terrestrial refraction

7085.84 --> 7092.400000000001
which is like the groundworks for that

7088.32 --> 7093.44
claim is not real it's not admitted to

7092.4 --> 7097.5599999999995
be

7093.44 --> 7101.119
real it's just a mathematical

7097.56 --> 7105.119000000001
postulation that has no no physical

7101.119 --> 7107.5199999999995
backing of any kind light doesn't

7105.119 --> 7110.44
Bend its

7107.52 --> 7114.2390000000005
pathway you can't see around the corner

7110.44 --> 7116.879999999999
you can't see behind a hill there's no

7114.239 --> 7118.959999999999
circumstance that make that possible

7116.88 --> 7121.88
that are there in

7118.96 --> 7124.4800000000005
nature it doesn't happen you might be

7121.88 --> 7126.2390000000005
able to like pour some freezing liquid

7124.48 --> 7128.44
onto something and then you could like

7126.239 --> 7130.839999999999
sort of mirror look behind something

7128.44 --> 7134.0
yeah that's all absolutely unnatural

7130.84 --> 7136.679
conditions that never ever happen on

7134.0 --> 7138.4
Earth in order to lead to these Black

7136.679 --> 7141.76
Swan observations where you can see that

7138.4 --> 7144.199
far well guess what there was no liquid

7141.76 --> 7146.2390000000005
nitrogen on the ground in order for you

7144.199 --> 7149.0
to see all the way behind the

7146.239 --> 7151.839999999999
presupposed sphere Edge no no it's just

7149.0 --> 7155.199
normal conditions cleared and you can

7151.84 --> 7157.96
see very far because it's flat and the

7155.199 --> 7157.96
Horizon is not

7158.239 --> 7161.239
geometric

7164.57 --> 7167.639999999999
[Music]

7170.44 --> 7175.799999999999
do I support the what the [ __ ] are you

7172.92 --> 7178.679
talking about support a

7175.8 --> 7181.04
map the map is a map I don't support

7178.679 --> 7183.84
anything it's just a map it's just a

7181.04 --> 7183.84
projection

7186.8 --> 7193.2390000000005
thing yeah the map doesn't prove it it's

7189.92 --> 7195.4
flat because it's in a certain way that

7193.239 --> 7197.36
it's measured flat proves that it's flat

7195.4 --> 7200.839999999999
and that you couldn't make the

7197.36 --> 7204.239
map if it wasn't flat that supports that

7200.84 --> 7206.639
it's flat not the shape of the map it's

7204.239 --> 7209.079
just a projection that was made because

7206.639 --> 7211.96
the Earth was flat and you can measure

7209.079 --> 7215.32
angles to the stars at a consistent rate

7211.96 --> 7215.32
in relation to the

7217.04 --> 7223.079
Horizon because it's flat

7221.04 --> 7225.079
that's why you have that map you can

7223.079 --> 7227.239
make that map because the Earth is flat

7225.079 --> 7229.96
if it wasn't flat you couldn't make that

7227.239 --> 7232.959999999999
map you couldn't presuppose that that

7229.96 --> 7236.32
flat map was a sphere if the Earth was a

7232.96 --> 7240.04
sphere yeah you can presuppose that the

7236.32 --> 7243.36
Flat Earth is a sphere because it's flat

7240.04 --> 7246.44
and you were able to map it and make it

7243.36 --> 7248.679
into that map that you then presupposed

7246.44 --> 7251.159
was a sphere if the Earth was a sphere

7248.679 --> 7256.119
you wouldn't be able to do any of that

7251.159 --> 7256.119
anything at all you wouldn't have

7256.76 --> 7260.280000000001
maps not like

7261.04 --> 7265.8
that I mean at that point it would be

7263.8 --> 7268.0
more logical that people would just send

7265.8 --> 7270.320000000001
up balloons with photographs and do it

7268.0 --> 7272.88
like that and just roughly put it

7270.32 --> 7276.079
together but I mean you would not be

7272.88 --> 7278.04
able to use the celestial lights they

7276.079 --> 7280.079
would be light you would roughly think

7278.04 --> 7281.48
like oh we're on this side or something

7280.079 --> 7283.92
of the

7281.48 --> 7286.28
globe but you're not going to be able to

7283.92 --> 7289.2390000000005
like really accurately use Celestial

7286.28 --> 7293.239
navigation then because the Horizon is

7289.239 --> 7295.718999999999
required for that as an anchoring Point

7293.239 --> 7297.959999999999
orientation point but you can't use it

7295.719 --> 7302.199
anymore because now it's geometric and

7297.96 --> 7304.84
it changes with height making Celestial

7302.199 --> 7304.839999999999
navigation

7305.079 --> 7309.84
impossible so it's a good thing that the

7308.239 --> 7311.5199999999995
Earth is flat

7309.84 --> 7314.599
that the

7311.52 --> 7317.400000000001
celestials stay in the same angular

7314.599 --> 7320.4400000000005
position no matter what your height

7317.4 --> 7323.0
is it's very good that it does that

7320.44 --> 7326.4
because if it wouldn't well we wouldn't

7323.0 --> 7329.76
have maps not like these we wouldn't

7326.4 --> 7329.759999999999
have Celestial

7335.639 --> 7340.96
Maps hey

7337.96 --> 7340.96
El

7353.239 --> 7358.079
just l no I didn't you just didn't

7356.04 --> 7360.199
listen to anything I've said in the last

7358.079 --> 7365.0
half hour Brianna

7360.199 --> 7367.079
Johnson you're just like d it's all gone

7365.0 --> 7369.0
everything I said it's all gone because

7367.079 --> 7371.239
what I explained addressed everything

7369.0 --> 7373.04
everything it addressed everything that

7371.239 --> 7375.718999999999
you're now complaining about I

7373.04 --> 7377.84
supposedly didn't say when I said

7375.719 --> 7382.079
everything that you're now complaining

7377.84 --> 7386.1990000000005
about I did it all every detail every

7382.079 --> 7388.759999999999
part you're just saying oh no because

7386.199 --> 7390.5599999999995
you didn't listen because you put [ __ ]

7388.76 --> 7392.599
in your ears and you didn't listen to

7390.56 --> 7395.8
what I just said all these things I just

7392.599 --> 7397.88
said are true and they prove the Earth

7395.8 --> 7403.52
is

7397.88 --> 7407.679
flat the circumstances of reality itself

7403.52 --> 7410.679
and what happens in reality proves it's

7407.679 --> 7410.679
flat

7411.239 --> 7416.638999999999
dumbass putting [ __ ] in your ears and

7413.84 --> 7418.8
not listening is not going to undo the

7416.639 --> 7420.2390000000005
fact that the Earth is flat measured

7418.8 --> 7423.4400000000005
flat and we wouldn't have Celestial

7420.239 --> 7423.44
navigation if it wasn't

7425.0 --> 7429.84
flat yeah it's observation that you are

7428.0 --> 7432.119
not making you're not making any

7429.84 --> 7435.599
observation you're just ignoring

7432.119 --> 7439.719
everything you're ignoring the

7435.599 --> 7443.679
facts the admitted proven facts about

7439.719 --> 7443.679
what happens here on

7444.36 --> 7452.558999999999
Earth it's all been addressed you

7447.92 --> 7454.76
ignored all of it Brianna Johnson not my

7452.559 --> 7457.320000000001
problem your problem your problem that

7454.76 --> 7459.320000000001
you don't see that you've ignored

7457.32 --> 7461.5199999999995
everything that you're now complaining

7459.32 --> 7464.28
about it's really

7461.52 --> 7466.84
stupid almost as stupid as Sean Hawkins

7464.28 --> 7469.48
showing up get the [ __ ] out of here

7466.84 --> 7471.599
[ __ ] you don't have a place in my chat

7469.48 --> 7474.48
I'm not going to involve you in any kind

7471.599 --> 7477.76
of debating

7474.48 --> 7477.759999999999
ever dip

7485.52 --> 7490.76
[ __ ] the way it deps what

7493.4 --> 7497.04
you mean in relation to

7508.679 --> 7515.159
what the way it depicts the

7511.96 --> 7518.079
world uh it's a map

7515.159 --> 7521.92
projection do I agree with that that

7518.079 --> 7521.92
that's the way the world looks

7522.4 --> 7525.799999999999
no no I

7527.32 --> 7532.92
don't I think that the map projections

7530.559 --> 7534.96
that have the equator as a straight line

7532.92 --> 7538.04
are really the only ones that are

7534.96 --> 7540.679
legitimate that are getting close to

7538.04 --> 7544.239
being a ukian representation of of the

7540.679 --> 7544.2390000000005
realm that's what I

7547.679 --> 7550.679
think

7565.159 --> 7571.04
right but I mean who cares who cares how

7568.159 --> 7573.679
a map represents the world at this

7571.04 --> 7575.92
point there is no maps that are like

7573.679 --> 7577.599
actually perfectly accurate they're not

7575.92 --> 7580.599
out

7577.599 --> 7580.599
there

7584.36 --> 7591.799999999999
yeah a [ __ ] you don't have a place

7587.36 --> 7594.92
here don't you get it don't you just get

7591.8 --> 7597.04
it there's no point there's no point in

7594.92 --> 7599.84
you piping up with your [ __ ] I'm

7597.04 --> 7602.36
immediately kicking you out you're not

7616.76 --> 7620.559
trying Hey seeking star

7620.84 --> 7626.1990000000005
water took you so

7623.639 --> 7628.079
long I would have rounded out already

7626.199 --> 7630.558999999999
half an hour

7628.079 --> 7634.799999999999
ago but I I got caught up with these

7630.559 --> 7634.8
bards that are just

7637.52 --> 7640.52
unbelievable

7657.559 --> 7662.92
yeah see you can if you can't believe it

7659.48 --> 7666.239
aumu virus earlier literally

7662.92 --> 7666.2390000000005
says where is

7667.52 --> 7670.52
it

7674.32 --> 7677.04
what was it

7677.199 --> 7681.638999999999
again he said a lot of stupid things

7683.28 --> 7687.84
today yeah yeah akum virus tried to

7685.92 --> 7691.04
reinsert again

7687.84 --> 7693.88
that the globe doesn't have a geometric

7691.04 --> 7693.88
Claim about the

7694.04 --> 7700.44
Horizon you really tried

7697.44 --> 7700.44
that

7702.52 --> 7707.360000000001
hey why

7704.44 --> 7710.4
not you think that projecting will make

7707.36 --> 7710.4
me stop Banning

7726.44 --> 7730.719
you oh they like more about measure yeah

7729.04 --> 7733.96
well too bad it is

7730.719 --> 7735.84
flat I'm sorry that's not it's not like

7733.96 --> 7738.76
a shape you can hold in your hand but it

7735.84 --> 7742.32
is flat you can put your hand on it it's

7738.76 --> 7744.559
flat I'm sorry that it's not so tangible

7742.32 --> 7748.0
to you and like oh but the Horizon is

7744.559 --> 7751.119000000001
now not geometric and apparent and yeah

7748.0 --> 7753.88
that's too bad it's flat I'm sorry that

7751.119 --> 7756.4
inconvenience your

7753.88 --> 7757.32
sensibility very sorry about that but it

7756.4 --> 7760.32
is

7757.32 --> 7760.32
flat

7763.52 --> 7768.360000000001
yeah tangible and repeatably

7768.4 --> 7776.0
flat like it's very tangible that it's

7772.159 --> 7777.759999999999
flat flat flat flat flat all the way

7776.0 --> 7779.76
flat everywhere

7777.76 --> 7785.320000000001
flat

7779.76 --> 7786.639
yeah every part of the surfaces of Earth

7785.32 --> 7790.04
is

7786.639 --> 7792.639
parallel to every other part of the

7790.04 --> 7794.36
surface of Earth yeah there might be a

7792.639 --> 7796.719
little bit of mountain sticking out here

7794.36 --> 7800.48
and there and all that kind of thing but

7796.719 --> 7800.4800000000005
it's all parallel cuz it's

7804.28 --> 7812.079
flat what is my opinion on Antarctica

7807.48 --> 7815.159
versus Ice wall uh what ice

7812.079 --> 7817.88
wall and what

7815.159 --> 7818.759999999999
Antarctica I mean I don't know what that

7817.88 --> 7821.76
is

7818.76 --> 7824.280000000001
I think it's just an entire

7821.76 --> 7828.679
region I think Antarctica doesn't

7824.28 --> 7832.0
surround us I think it is like a big

7828.679 --> 7834.079
continent that's all Frozen

7832.0 --> 7837.96
up and it

7834.079 --> 7841.4
blocks connection to the southern

7837.96 --> 7844.0
regions like to the Realms south of us

7841.4 --> 7847.759999999999
that's what I think it is I think if you

7844.0 --> 7849.239
go further and further to the south at

7847.76 --> 7852.639
Antarctic

7849.239 --> 7853.959999999999
that you literally reach the beaches of

7852.639 --> 7856.52
South

7853.96 --> 7859.0
Antarctica and there might be another

7856.52 --> 7862.96
ocean

7859.0 --> 7862.96
there who knows what's

7863.719 --> 7869.44
there I don't think Antarctica is like a

7867.159 --> 7869.44
an

7870.52 --> 7875.119000000001
island but I don't think it surrounds us

7877.159 --> 7880.159
either

7885.76 --> 7893.679
six amongus of dark

7888.88 --> 7896.679
what light and daylight pure very pure

7893.679 --> 7896.679
okay

7907.159 --> 7910.159
sure

7915.679 --> 7923.4800000000005
and Arctica yeah a lot of it's

7918.719 --> 7926.559
funny anarctica yeah but the ca is like

7923.48 --> 7928.079
partially silent in it no so a lot of

7926.559 --> 7930.4800000000005
people just say

7928.079 --> 7933.119
Antarctica the sea the first sea is kind

7930.48 --> 7933.119
of Silent

7933.599 --> 7940.079
then but you're right

7937.079 --> 7940.079
seing

7943.52 --> 7949.159000000001
uh oh what Tommy what the [ __ ] is a

7956.44 --> 7961.0
oh the AE map is rumored to be poison in

7959.679 --> 7964.0
the well s

7961.0 --> 7964.0
up

7967.04 --> 7970.04
why

7978.639 --> 7983.0
I don't believe his Diaries no I've

7980.679 --> 7987.2390000000005
never read his Diaries seeking star

7983.0 --> 7990.599
water I mean he he explored some of

7987.239 --> 7992.959999999999
it but I mean I don't think he's ever

7990.599 --> 7996.76
actually like really delivered evidence

7992.96 --> 8002.84
that it does surround the

7996.76 --> 8002.84
realm it's it's just south it's just

8004.0 --> 8009.36
south 500,000 miles on that J yeah

8006.96 --> 8009.36
that's pretty

8015.76 --> 8020.1990000000005
incredible it's so what

8018.079 --> 8022.679
duper the [ __ ] does that have to do

8020.199 --> 8022.678999999999
anything with

8026.96 --> 8029.96
it

8031.719 --> 8036.8
well yeah 50,000 miles is like kind of

8034.32 --> 8036.799999999999
crazy

8039.88 --> 8043.84
though like how long did that take him

8042.159 --> 8047.598999999999
like 20 years or

8043.84 --> 8050.32
something that's a pretty insane time

8047.599 --> 8054.400000000001
amount of time that that's going to

8050.32 --> 8056.799999999999
cost ships D Diaries are incontestable

8054.4 --> 8058.4
okay well incontestable that just means

8056.8 --> 8062.76
that nobody else is ever tried to

8058.4 --> 8062.759999999999
confirm it seeing star

8081.159 --> 8086.879999999999
water right so yeah I don't know I don't

8083.92 --> 8089.88
think that Antarctica surrounds

8086.88 --> 8089.88
us

8097.76 --> 8102.76
and I don't think that the North Pole is

8099.48 --> 8102.759999999999
like a dead center

8113.36 --> 8118.88
either I'm sure you do Akuma virus

8115.719 --> 8121.159
quickly move on to more trivial things

8118.88 --> 8123.32
right much easier to decide upon those

8121.159 --> 8126.719
things than on reality

8123.32 --> 8129.88
itself as your beliefs are being

8126.719 --> 8132.84
smashed yeah better decide on which

8129.88 --> 8132.84
cereal you're going to

8139.719 --> 8144.199
get right anyway but I am going to round

8142.4 --> 8147.638999999999
out the show now I've been going

8144.199 --> 8149.759999999999
for 2 hours 15 minutes something like

8147.639 --> 8152.4800000000005
that

8149.76 --> 8155.159000000001
it's getting cool out

8152.48 --> 8159.079
here is looking very let's see if you

8155.159 --> 8161.96
can see that this time it's now up there

8159.079 --> 8161.96
yeah you can see

8162.559 --> 8165.559
it

8166.76 --> 8174.2390000000005
cool I guess it had to be higher in the

8169.36 --> 8176.719
sky in order to be visibly be visible

8174.239 --> 8180.919999999999
like that but there's the

8176.719 --> 8180.92
Moon it's like half a

8181.8 --> 8187.2390000000005
moon right
