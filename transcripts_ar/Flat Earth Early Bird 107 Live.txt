7.32 --> 37.95
[Music]

38.449 --> 45.329
good morning welcome to flatter the

42.69 --> 50.909
earlybird number 107

45.329 --> 54.69
I'm your host Arwen and the kind of

50.909 --> 56.039
similar day to yesterday beautiful blue

54.69 --> 60.0
skies

56.039 --> 68.72
chemtrails hiding in the back just check

60.0 --> 68.72
this out pretty nice

70.17 --> 81.09
nice and sunny but to some lots of birds

75.35 --> 83.97
and yeah some of you may have noticed

81.09 --> 85.53
that I was just right before this on the

83.97 --> 91.85
Flat Earth debates that started up a

85.53 --> 93.53
little bit early and also my friend

91.85 --> 98.58
Dayoung

93.53 --> 102.95
George EF was also on the debates yeah

98.58 --> 106.53
seems to be participating pretty nicely

102.95 --> 110.759
it's almost sad to go there or I mean to

106.53 --> 115.229
leave but yeah I gotta keep my own show

110.759 --> 116.85
running and yeah I'll let's see if it's

115.229 --> 120.179
still gonna be there probably the second

116.85 --> 127.41
show I'll pop back on that and see where

120.179 --> 131.37
they what they've gone so yeah lots is

127.41 --> 136.2
happening I was pretty impressed with

131.37 --> 139.82
the globe Buster's yesterday they set up

136.2 --> 143.17999999999998
like it was just typical globe Buster's

139.82 --> 148.17
but it was a nice angle at it basically

143.18 --> 150.959
joking how thanks to the behind the

148.17 --> 154.23
curve documentary it is falsely

150.959 --> 156.75
suggested by the ballers now that Bob

154.23 --> 159.78
from Globo stirs proved the Earth's

156.75 --> 165.15
rotation and jaren proved the curvature

159.78 --> 167.76
it is it is quite the the propaganda

165.15 --> 170.549
trick as it were reversed world trick

167.76 --> 173.79999999999998
and I think it's pretty smart for as far

170.549 --> 179.29000000000002
as smarts go ballers are concerned

173.8 --> 182.5
but Yad was a good show and it's good to

179.29 --> 185.98
be in chat they're also got a good look

182.5 --> 190.39
again that it's a NASA stuff what

185.98 --> 192.66
they're doing and I have to say that yep

190.39 --> 196.32999999999998
they have been maybe somewhat clumsy

192.66 --> 199.10999999999999
very clumsy but still I'm quite

196.33 --> 203.44000000000003
impressed by everything they tried out

199.11 --> 206.71
it's just that yeah he's all that money

203.44 --> 211.42
really worth that I could have done so

206.71 --> 213.6
much more or have cost so much less it

211.42 --> 217.78
is what it is

213.6 --> 220.92
yeah let's use chat Steve Agee I am John

217.78 --> 224.97
Watson Julie Bennett Sean Becker

220.92 --> 224.97
uber-cool wrong

225.54 --> 231.60999999999999
Walter yeah good to see you guys

229.09 --> 233.17000000000002
yeah some of you may also be on the

231.61 --> 238.09
debate checking out what's going on

233.17 --> 242.19
there I like I'm not blaming you

238.09 --> 245.459
it's very interesting hey the Shadowcat

242.19 --> 245.459
yeah I

246.069 --> 257.199
again look I follow mainstream media and

250.62 --> 260.53000000000003
alternative media and yeah I've been

257.199 --> 263.08000000000004
bumping into some serious propaganda as

260.53 --> 263.73999999999995
I even explain it like I rolled right

263.08 --> 265.63
into it

263.74 --> 269.05
with some things that were just like

265.63 --> 272.199
heavily suggestive and shocking to me

269.05 --> 276.58
because I am you can't help it but be

272.199 --> 278.5
emotionally invested in things so hey

276.58 --> 280.33
thank you for the super chat donation by

278.5 --> 283.449
the way only she people can't see

280.33 --> 286.479
another 10 New Zealand dollars thank you

283.449 --> 290.71000000000004
so much for that that's climbing it's

286.479 --> 293.199
nice I'll get to that p900

290.71 --> 295.38899999999995
this way definitely people keep on

293.199 --> 299.74
helping me out so thank you so much for

295.389 --> 307.21000000000004
the donation but yeah I found an example

299.74 --> 311.8
I found an example of a blatant media

307.21 --> 312.34
warfare between two angles it's very

311.8 --> 316.36
current

312.34 --> 319.21
so I into this through RT and through

316.36 --> 323.289
info wars and I wanted to share this

319.21 --> 326.68
just to show you how complex things have

323.289 --> 333.63
become out there so let's see we're

326.68 --> 333.63
gonna present this try presentation mode

334.71 --> 340.60999999999996
oh my god I got so many windows open

342.32 --> 345.32
right

349.16 --> 357.21000000000004
okay let's first get from the Infowars

352.97 --> 368.759
the article and yeah it's pretty

357.21 --> 371.729
compelling in some way so right so here

368.759 --> 375.12
you got an Infowars article I'll just

371.729 --> 379.65
read out the title socialism Maduro sets

375.12 --> 383.34000000000003
you matera you mana terrian and trucks

379.65 --> 388.85999999999996
ablaze as feathers away to starve like

383.34 --> 391.229
whoa yeah he's doing that try to stave

388.86 --> 395.16
off the influences of America that are

391.229 --> 398.50899999999996
obviously yet Trump the group has seems

395.16 --> 398.509
to have set their set

398.96 --> 406.76
yeah they've set their wheel on

404.0 --> 408.71
Venezuela to try and do something there

406.76 --> 413.18
to try and get more grip and so yeah

408.71 --> 417.44
this comes in but then but then the same

413.18 --> 431.56
time I went to Artie and I saw something

417.44 --> 434.57
different so yeah then there's this

431.56 --> 437.42
us-backed opposition caught on video

434.57 --> 443.57
throwing Molotov cocktails at a truck on

437.42 --> 447.77000000000004
the Venezuelan border so yeah who's

443.57 --> 450.59
actually doing what can somebody still

447.77 --> 454.9
keep track of the potential controlled

450.59 --> 458.39
opposition's that are happening it is

454.9 --> 463.76
it's right there it's like okay who's

458.39 --> 467.51
actually right in this because who did

463.76 --> 471.31
throw these Molotov cocktails were they

467.51 --> 474.77
by some US controlled opposition group

471.31 --> 479.18
that are just working on them doing that

474.77 --> 482.33
or was it actually yeah the Maduro

479.18 --> 484.82
people really yeah

482.33 --> 486.68
showing that image like no we don't want

484.82 --> 491.09
you here we don't need you here and yeah

486.68 --> 493.52
look the whole starvation thing there

491.09 --> 496.48999999999995
something did kind of happen in that

493.52 --> 498.02
sense at least some time ago but there's

496.49 --> 500.0
he even back then there were

498.02 --> 502.47999999999996
speculations like what is actually

500.0 --> 506.54
causing that is it caused by the

502.48 --> 508.31
sanctions that America laid on Venezuela

506.54 --> 510.86
that that happened that the trade was

508.31 --> 513.23
blocked was it really caused by the

510.86 --> 519.909
socialism or was it just caused by the

513.23 --> 523.269
sanctions and even recently yeah that

519.909 --> 525.43
the there was people just going through

523.269 --> 530.7090000000001
supermarkets and they seemed perfectly

525.43 --> 539.2589999999999
fine they did have food so yeah this is

530.709 --> 542.41
getting really complex and feeling the

539.259 --> 545.74
strain of it pretty much if you know

542.41 --> 549.31
what I mean oh wow thank you on the ship

545.74 --> 552.73
you can see for another 10 New Zealand

549.31 --> 555.0999999999999
dollar super jet there FP 1000 set a

552.73 --> 559.8100000000001
better zoom oh yeah

555.1 --> 563.1
P 1000 p900 look for me it e it will be

559.81 --> 565.779
plenty look I'm not here to like

563.1 --> 567.97
discover something new I just want to

565.779 --> 572.079
have some good footage that is good

567.97 --> 574.6600000000001
enough so I'll settle for a P 900 by the

572.079 --> 579.0089999999999
p1000 sure why not

574.66 --> 585.25
you know but I'm not gonna strain myself

579.009 --> 587.88
to get to that so yeah that was just the

585.25 --> 590.41
example that really popped in my face

587.88 --> 595.029
political propaganda and the different

590.41 --> 598.98
sides and how do you even know what's

595.029 --> 602.68
real anymore and the sides are

598.98 --> 606.5790000000001
politicized they do leave out details

602.68 --> 611.05
and then overemphasize others they

606.579 --> 613.199
forward possibilities that can be

611.05 --> 616.899
considered definitely they are

613.199 --> 620.3389999999999
considerable they could be real but who

616.899 --> 620.339
is doing what and why

622.86 --> 630.3000000000001
how does this really work sometimes it

627.54 --> 632.04
feels like it's just a game a controlled

630.3 --> 635.0699999999999
game being played between the two

632.04 --> 639.24
parties and the media's the front lines

635.07 --> 641.37
in it so I don't know it's very hard to

639.24 --> 647.33
tell for me very very hard I just do

641.37 --> 652.05
know that the American point of view

647.33 --> 654.3000000000001
this is not this really it wasn't what

652.05 --> 658.77
Trump promised promised no

654.3 --> 663.51
interventionism no real war just over

658.77 --> 665.67
the fence National Defense this seems to

663.51 --> 670.43
not be like that no matter how you

665.67 --> 670.43
really put it so

673.5 --> 681.01
it doesn't really make me happy but oh

677.709 --> 684.6999999999999
well it is what it is things are just

681.01 --> 687.639
gonna have to play out as they do and

684.7 --> 690.19
this is just one front because with so

687.639 --> 695.0790000000001
many things happening a new Middle East

690.19 --> 698.32
what's going on in there oh my god yeah

695.079 --> 701.5
the US doesn't seem to really be wanting

698.32 --> 708.269
to give up their warmongering I'll just

701.5 --> 708.269
call it and it makes me sad because

709.7 --> 713.11
I think in a way that

714.259 --> 725.22
it's almost too far reach but you know

719.099 --> 727.619
if the u.s. wasn't Imperial about the

725.22 --> 733.639
whole deal and really wanted to keep the

727.619 --> 733.639
control over everything they could be

734.6 --> 740.45
a good stabilization force really the

738.59 --> 744.77
stabilization force is supposed to keep

740.45 --> 747.0500000000001
things as they are and not imperialize

744.77 --> 749.78
and change things in order to become

747.05 --> 753.43
that force it's so conflicting in that

749.78 --> 753.43
sense it's such a waste

759.47 --> 767.839
seems that it's just the economy again

762.319 --> 769.8689999999999
that the the movement we need to keep it

767.839 --> 769.869
going

774.81 --> 783.42
how can you overcome this it's so tough

780.44 --> 789.6300000000001
can you overcome it from the inside can

783.42 --> 793.0699999999999
can they stop or are the people just

789.63 --> 796.14
gonna have to stand up and make it stop

793.07 --> 799.62
we've also been looking into more yellow

796.14 --> 804.86
fast protests and some videos some Dutch

799.62 --> 808.1
videos through the typical Dutch

804.86 --> 810.87
alternative media sources that I use

808.1 --> 814.41
keeping track of that forever for a long

810.87 --> 815.97
long time and yeah just seeing like what

814.41 --> 818.1899999999999
are these yellow fest brothers in the

815.97 --> 819.84
nettle is actually doing and what are

818.19 --> 821.7600000000001
they standing for what is their

819.84 --> 828.12
principles and it was pretty impressed

821.76 --> 832.3199999999999
by what they had to say and also makes

828.12 --> 837.51
me realize like oh yeah I'm kind of not

832.32 --> 841.11
really that focused on Dutch things now

837.51 --> 845.49
a lot about a lot I think I know much

841.11 --> 846.9
about geopolitics at least half a senses

845.49 --> 849.69
what's going on but like the real

846.9 --> 852.03
details in the Netherlands like I should

849.69 --> 855.9300000000001
probably learn a bit more about it since

852.03 --> 858.7099999999999
it is my home geez yeah it's where I've

855.93 --> 858.7099999999999
been born and raised

859.43 --> 865.3499999999999
but it rings like is a separate

862.62 --> 869.34
complication that maybe it's just

865.35 --> 872.13
typically Dutch that Dutch can and will

869.34 --> 874.8000000000001
make things just a little bit more

872.13 --> 877.92
complex than average just to give that

874.8 --> 881.0
extra challenge and yeah the government

877.92 --> 881.0
here is just

890.27 --> 896.27
that just being autocratic

893.78 --> 901.5699999999999
in a kind of passive way they're just

896.27 --> 905.0
doing a quickly closed the doors policy

901.57 --> 907.82
just okay we're gonna do this we're

905.0 --> 910.76
gonna try to present it and work it out

907.82 --> 913.97
to be the most reasonable that we can

910.76 --> 916.93
think of and if you don't agree that's

913.97 --> 919.3100000000001
too bad we're just gonna close the doors

916.93 --> 922.01
police are gonna just not let people

919.31 --> 924.2199999999999
through and you can say whatever you

922.01 --> 927.11
want we're just gonna do what we want

924.22 --> 930.6800000000001
we're gonna follow our plan and yeah

927.11 --> 934.91
we're the rulers ha ha ha we have the

930.68 --> 938.15
cops that's kind of the feel of it yeah

934.91 --> 940.4
in it it's been it didn't like that kind

938.15 --> 942.92
of like that already as far as I could

940.4 --> 944.39
tell from looking a little bit more fun

942.92 --> 948.5
with this it's been like that for at

944.39 --> 952.46
least a decade and didn't go away it's

948.5 --> 954.47
become worse so yeah I'm not surprised

952.46 --> 956.87
that the yellow fest movement is gaining

954.47 --> 960.64
momentum here getting popularity because

956.87 --> 960.64
yeah it's becoming very blatant

964.3 --> 968.74
so yeah that is also happening out there

966.46 --> 973.35
you know we're dealing with the flat

968.74 --> 976.33
earth globe earth NASA and

973.35 --> 979.75
conceptualization of our world it

976.33 --> 982.84
mysteries the hidden past the power

979.75 --> 984.76
struggles the powers that be trying to

982.84 --> 987.9100000000001
manipulate things trying to erase

984.76 --> 990.73
history to to create a narrative

987.91 --> 993.3399999999999
advantage on the long run for themselves

990.73 --> 997.69
but yeah at the same time as a current

993.34 --> 1001.62
events current more localized power

997.69 --> 1003.9300000000001
struggles between governments and their

1001.62 --> 1008.01
people and the government's among

1003.93 --> 1011.8199999999999
themselves it's such a complex issue so

1008.01 --> 1016.65
why it is what it is all gonna have to

1011.82 --> 1021.21
find a place that that we feel we could

1016.65 --> 1023.85
do something useful in it and they were

1021.21 --> 1027.6000000000001
best they were best to change the world

1023.85 --> 1031.1
for the better in a way yeah that makes

1027.6 --> 1031.1
sense to us that we can

1031.569 --> 1048.22
so let's call it justice all right we

1045.819 --> 1049.359
can maybe come back on to that in a

1048.22 --> 1054.8990000000001
moment I didn't if you wanted to round

1049.359 --> 1062.109
out your point diem yes Oh yep

1054.899 --> 1064.7199999999998
yes yeah having the floor it seems I'm

1062.109 --> 1068.59
flattered at the Bates I'm really

1064.72 --> 1071.309
impressed by that guy he's really he's

1068.59 --> 1071.309
really into it

1072.47 --> 1077.8700000000001
so yeah I'm very curious everything he

1075.169 --> 1080.509
has to contribute to the Flat Earth

1077.87 --> 1083.4189999999999
debates because he certainly seems to be

1080.509 --> 1085.879
making an effort yeah I'm glad to have

1083.419 --> 1090.3500000000001
him on the team if he's gonna be on the

1085.879 --> 1091.9399999999998
team so that's cool I was honored to

1090.35 --> 1094.4289999999999
have him on my show yesterday was a

1091.94 --> 1097.97
really good guest so so many good

1094.429 --> 1100.46
questions so many insights refreshing to

1097.97 --> 1101.419
find a new person that yeah that's that

1100.46 --> 1104.929
smart

1101.419 --> 1106.759
knows that much and has some really good

1104.929 --> 1113.1200000000001
source videos oh my god

1106.759 --> 1117.289
I guess I will present one of these it's

1113.12 --> 1120.4699999999998
just it's kind of a curiosity but it is

1117.289 --> 1122.389
fascinating it is like in the theme of

1120.47 --> 1127.659
nature technology that we talked about

1122.389 --> 1127.6589999999999
yesterday see if I

1130.72 --> 1137.26
if I can present it's a it's just a 45

1134.15 --> 1137.26
second video

1142.059 --> 1151.769
so let's see this try to narrate in a

1146.919 --> 1157.96
more sensible way it's just just behold

1151.769 --> 1161.469
there's this garuda Sanjivani roots a

1157.96 --> 1165.6390000000001
certain plant root that's hat that has

1161.469 --> 1169.2
this miraculous properties inherent to

1165.639 --> 1169.1999999999998
it so just take a look at this

1177.43 --> 1180.21
look at that

1180.57 --> 1192.76
that's a nonliving object just to be

1185.26 --> 1195.19
clear that's an inanimate object purify

1192.76 --> 1213.909
its dynamics and I look at this it's the

1195.19 --> 1216.179
same thing in inanimate object see that

1213.909 --> 1216.179
again

1238.36 --> 1251.62
nature nature how do you dazzle us this

1247.399 --> 1251.62
is one of the ways the nature does it

1253.57 --> 1261.85
right it's just these amazing Aero

1258.549 --> 1265.22
hydrodynamic properties of shapes

1261.85 --> 1271.059
surface types and all these things that

1265.22 --> 1274.6100000000001
can just happen naturally by its design

1271.059 --> 1278.69
and it's that's a plant it's just a root

1274.61 --> 1283.01
of a plants inanimate and it does that

1278.69 --> 1284.779
it's just incredible isn't it right now

1283.01 --> 1286.94
I'll put out the video in the

1284.779 --> 1292.21
description box if you want to have a

1286.94 --> 1292.21
look at it but yeah thank you

1296.73 --> 1304.89
thank you damn for bringing forth that

1301.45 --> 1304.89
video is really impressed

1310.96 --> 1314.88
so take a look at it

1316.35 --> 1323.039
and yeah that I think it was related

1320.1 --> 1326.1589999999999
mostly to the point he made about how

1323.039 --> 1328.62
vicious certain fish types jump up

1326.159 --> 1330.1490000000001
stream how that works how they can

1328.62 --> 1332.039
actually do that now they're not just

1330.149 --> 1338.36
being smacked down by the water while

1332.039 --> 1340.86
apparently this root the shape has

1338.36 --> 1343.4699999999998
according to him and I would tend to

1340.86 --> 1349.07
agree similar properties to the fish

1343.47 --> 1353.34
guilt that'll actually push

1349.07 --> 1356.58
automatically up the stream it's just

1353.34 --> 1359.82
amazing isn't it it's like who needs

1356.58 --> 1362.97
pumps and engines no it's just inanimate

1359.82 --> 1366.59
the design it does it it's just freaking

1362.97 --> 1369.72
amazing and gives me a lot of hope that

1366.59 --> 1372.36
there is there are so many properties

1369.72 --> 1376.44
out there in nature to be discovered and

1372.36 --> 1381.4189999999999
rediscovered that can make things so

1376.44 --> 1384.96
efficient and and not drain our energy

1381.419 --> 1387.419
sources when we want to do things and

1384.96 --> 1389.759
I've even been like imagining imagining

1387.419 --> 1393.5700000000002
purely in my head like there could be

1389.759 --> 1397.799
like this let's just say it like this

1393.57 --> 1404.789
I've imagined that probably somebody

1397.799 --> 1408.33
could build like a small waterfall where

1404.789 --> 1411.24
the water actually goes upwards all the

1408.33 --> 1413.9089999999999
way like through several steps I don't

1411.24 --> 1416.19
know if that's anything near what can be

1413.909 --> 1417.929
real but I saw that like yeah if you

1416.19 --> 1419.8790000000001
find these kind of properties like they

1417.929 --> 1424.19
could go against the strain then maybe

1419.879 --> 1426.53
you could technically make some kind of

1424.19 --> 1428.93
well yeah multiple step water for one

1426.53 --> 1431.3899999999999
where the water actually moves upwards

1428.93 --> 1438.14
naturally wouldn't that be something

1431.39 --> 1440.2700000000002
yes yeah I'll leave that to the to the

1438.14 --> 1442.5400000000002
garage designers to do come up with

1440.27 --> 1446.66
something like that and actually do it

1442.54 --> 1450.44
you know and hey even if you look at

1446.66 --> 1452.78
some gadgets in the bigger mega

1450.44 --> 1457.66
structure designers out there they do

1452.78 --> 1460.8799999999999
have like these kind of gadgets these

1457.66 --> 1465.38
weird natural phenomenons that they use

1460.88 --> 1467.21
for their gadgets that do that they

1465.38 --> 1470.18
would look amazing it's not as amazing

1467.21 --> 1472.81
as this in my opinion this was really

1470.18 --> 1477.1100000000001
amazing but they already do try to use

1472.81 --> 1481.97
like these design tricks for their

1477.11 --> 1484.4599999999998
gadgets for found water fountains and so

1481.97 --> 1487.13
you have many of these architects they

1484.46 --> 1489.14
already do know the trickeries probably

1487.13 --> 1493.16
have a whole book full of this

1489.14 --> 1495.1100000000001
descriptions of what is out there be

1493.16 --> 1499.3100000000002
really cool to get our hands on you know

1495.11 --> 1501.8
and I think that things like the Scarab

1499.31 --> 1504.3799999999999
wings that helps I have like these

1501.8 --> 1507.73
electrical electromagnetic properties

1504.38 --> 1511.3700000000001
also fall under this type of natural

1507.73 --> 1514.34
phenomena and they - you have already

1511.37 --> 1519.9399999999998
learned a lot about it how are some

1514.34 --> 1523.55
insects use electromagnetic properties -

1519.94 --> 1526.49
to great gain greater maneuverability or

1523.55 --> 1530.0
greater lift so yeah that kind of thing

1526.49 --> 1535.55
it just exists in nature and is there

1530.0 --> 1537.6
for the picking in whatever we are gonna

1535.55 --> 1539.85
design

1537.6 --> 1543.35
eat for good or bad hopefully for good

1539.85 --> 1543.35
mostly so

1552.48 --> 1563.07
also I've been watching a little bit

1558.49 --> 1572.6200000000001
more alternative media stuff concerning

1563.07 --> 1575.6499999999999
it's just one example let's see yeah it

1572.62 --> 1579.27
was actually a little piece of inking

1575.65 --> 1584.7
the aliens with the guy with the hair

1579.27 --> 1590.71
but yeah was another alien UFO ology

1584.7 --> 1594.22
legends about is it the the Fuchs Ian

1590.71 --> 1595.8700000000001
lay a fishing lake in China they talked

1594.22 --> 1597.55
about yeah there's a pyramid in that

1595.87 --> 1602.79
Lake and a pair of it is older than the

1597.55 --> 1605.35
lake itself and ancient aliens right and

1602.79 --> 1607.3899999999999
yeah that's their angle of course and

1605.35 --> 1609.37
I'd say like oh there you go there's

1607.39 --> 1611.2900000000002
more proof that yeah that's from the

1609.37 --> 1613.1499999999999
Atlantean Age when they build all the

1611.29 --> 1615.01
freakin pyramids everywhere and then a

1613.15 --> 1618.73
flood came and the funny thing is like

1615.01 --> 1621.8799999999999
in between tongue and cheek they pretty

1618.73 --> 1627.06
much just say like yeah and then the

1621.88 --> 1631.0900000000001
flood happened so they are actually

1627.06 --> 1634.6
embracing the concept and they're just

1631.09 --> 1638.5
taking over the ancient aliens over the

1634.6 --> 1643.12
Atlanteans and well who were the

1638.5 --> 1645.79
Atlanteans how human were most of them

1643.12 --> 1648.1
what did they all do to themselves with

1645.79 --> 1653.31
their technology worth did they modify

1648.1 --> 1656.77
themselves for example did the Giants I

1653.31 --> 1659.8
believe were part of their society an

1656.77 --> 1661.72
essential part to basically help build

1659.8 --> 1664.72
all these giant structures and lift

1661.72 --> 1671.22
these megaliths they're just impossible

1664.72 --> 1671.22
to deal with in any other way yeah

1671.47 --> 1678.88
there's something to say for the concept

1674.11 --> 1682.79
it's just yeah of course it's still

1678.88 --> 1684.8300000000002
basic routed in the suggestion aliens

1682.79 --> 1691.87
from other planets because the earth is

1684.83 --> 1695.27
a planet and yeah so they they built

1691.87 --> 1697.37
historical narrative that is kind of

1695.27 --> 1700.49
closer to the real thing

1697.37 --> 1702.26
much more filler much more explanation

1700.49 --> 1703.94
but it is of course routed in the

1702.26 --> 1717.3799999999999
presupposition that you're at this globe

1703.94 --> 1720.98
because they have to yeah but seriously

1717.38 --> 1725.14
guys like this world this world is

1720.98 --> 1728.09
amazing there's so many things and

1725.14 --> 1733.8700000000001
amazing things that happened in the past

1728.09 --> 1737.6599999999999
that are just overwhelming in a way gran

1733.87 --> 1740.2399999999998
grandiose and it's all in the past and

1737.66 --> 1746.5400000000002
and they actually managed to hide all of

1740.24 --> 1749.39
that from the public conscious it's

1746.54 --> 1751.94
pretty remarkable and kind of an Irving

1749.39 --> 1757.5700000000002
that really you can hide something that

1751.94 --> 1757.5700000000002
big from everyone

1758.979 --> 1768.279
and and yeah nothing you could reason

1762.229 --> 1768.279
out how but why did that work so well

1770.319 --> 1775.33
just

1772.81 --> 1779.62
makes me a bit personally disappointed

1775.33 --> 1783.52
in how gullible humanity seems to be

1779.62 --> 1786.52
overall or not even gullible it's like

1783.52 --> 1791.32
were they really fooled or were they

1786.52 --> 1794.26
truly convinced that it is better to let

1791.32 --> 1801.55
that go and replace it

1794.26 --> 1804.49
were they yeah just not entirely full to

1801.55 --> 1809.53
not mind blanked but just convinced like

1804.49 --> 1812.59
yeah this pass is a mess we got better

1809.53 --> 1814.81
plans for the future let's just

1812.59 --> 1816.73
rearrange it and forget about the far

1814.81 --> 1820.36
past we're not really

1816.73 --> 1823.84
it's no use for us to hold on to that

1820.36 --> 1827.86
that kind of thing can a people at some

1823.84 --> 1832.5
point be convinced to just go along with

1827.86 --> 1832.5
let it go the past without a fight

1834.08 --> 1838.6
I think probably they can

1839.83 --> 1845.769
and they have been because how else

1843.19 --> 1848.3700000000001
could all of this been hidden from us

1845.769 --> 1848.3700000000001
for so long

1859.3 --> 1862.3
Cheers

1865.58 --> 1868.48
yeah

1889.85 --> 1894.1789999999999
that right seems like the first debate

1892.0 --> 1897.409
stop

1894.179 --> 1897.409
on a break now

1905.57 --> 1911.86
thanks for keeping track of that

1909.16 --> 1914.0800000000002
of chat I was very much distracted by my

1911.86 --> 1916.4699999999998
my own thoughts I hadn't paid much

1914.08 --> 1916.47
attention

1925.41 --> 1929.63
Oh stopping traffic in my rest I hat

1932.8 --> 1941.6
reality is exciting it is fast it's

1939.62 --> 1944.7099999999998
complex

1941.6 --> 1944.7099999999998
as great depth

1948.98 --> 1956.75
and there seemed to be just natural

1952.82 --> 1959.86
stepping stones on the way anchor points

1956.75 --> 1963.26
to which you can ground yourself and

1959.86 --> 1966.4089999999999
look at it from the perspective of that

1963.26 --> 1970.85
grounding foundation and it still kind

1966.409 --> 1972.98
of works but yeah if you choose to climb

1970.85 --> 1975.649
further then yeah you will find out more

1972.98 --> 1978.74
and you will find out the mistakes the

1975.649 --> 1981.9499999999998
previous platform you rested upon then

1978.74 --> 1986.36
it seems like the whole thing is is like

1981.95 --> 1991.5800000000002
this naturally it's pretty astonishing

1986.36 --> 1994.24
to me that it works this way to the

1991.58 --> 1994.24
consciousness

1999.38 --> 2005.89
and in a way it's almost a relief yeah

2003.19 --> 2009.3400000000001
could you imagine

2005.89 --> 2011.919
there was no way to that there weren't

2009.34 --> 2016.4499999999998
these stepping stones to rest upon it

2011.919 --> 2019.96
just explore things from that point of

2016.45 --> 2023.669
view but that you have to take it all

2019.96 --> 2026.679
all at once know who could start out

2023.669 --> 2027.19
figuring this out and just take it all

2026.679 --> 2029.3500000000001
at once

2027.19 --> 2031.45
seriously it's nobody could take that

2029.35 --> 2034.75
look how much trouble people already

2031.45 --> 2041.76
have with just responding to flattering

2034.75 --> 2041.76
it's already such a have the effect

2067.46 --> 2079.329
so yeah I will take guests if anybody

2072.95 --> 2079.3289999999997
wants to all just keep it nice

2083.6 --> 2091.5099999999998
enjoy the weather but I'll put out a

2089.09 --> 2091.51
link

2115.03 --> 2119.65
that was interest of them being part of

2117.19 --> 2120.3
my panel and there's the second half of

2119.65 --> 2122.98
the show

2120.3 --> 2126.88
you can find it in the mess to be in the

2122.98 --> 2133.45
letters the earlybird chat all our

2126.88 --> 2136.27
welcome that are in that chat what am i

2133.45 --> 2140.14
eating the usuals no no illuminati

2136.27 --> 2144.12
croissant today kind of expensive so you

2140.14 --> 2147.73
can't do that every time yeah maybe

2144.12 --> 2149.44
maybe in the future I could afford that

2147.73 --> 2153.52
kind of thing but for now it's just a

2149.44 --> 2157.51
nice simple loaf of bread some seeds on

2153.52 --> 2162.69
it I love that like it with organic

2157.51 --> 2162.69
butter and strawberry jelly don't

2194.65 --> 2202.2400000000002
right musicians for truth good point 300

2198.91 --> 2204.8799999999997
tons of stone for primitive men to

2202.24 --> 2205.7099999999996
manipulate logs and ropes are ain't

2204.88 --> 2209.7400000000002
cutting it

2205.71 --> 2213.579
they're getting cut from the weight and

2209.74 --> 2215.64
again I brought this concept forth many

2213.579 --> 2219.46
times

2215.64 --> 2223.0589999999997
look we can now with our advanced

2219.46 --> 2227.079
knowledge make very sturdy machines that

2223.059 --> 2232.1090000000004
we can operate that could potentially do

2227.079 --> 2239.73
something with those huge solid objects

2232.109 --> 2239.73
but it's it's still going to be

2243.95 --> 2253.73
it's a weird comparison it's like using

2247.42 --> 2257.299
Asian food sticks to to eat whole cooked

2253.73 --> 2259.52
potatoes you know it's like yeah even

2257.299 --> 2262.72
though it's good design works it's still

2259.52 --> 2265.549
all very small from the small-scale

2262.72 --> 2269.77
perspective trying to handle something

2265.549 --> 2273.2
really big and it's always troublesome

2269.77 --> 2276.2599999999998
it's always issues while if you just

2273.2 --> 2279.2
have any freaking huge huge humanoid

2276.26 --> 2281.869
it's not gonna be that big issue it's

2279.2 --> 2284.54
just gonna be like movers moving

2281.869 --> 2286.609
something really big and yeah things can

2284.54 --> 2292.97
go wrong they could potentially trip

2286.609 --> 2295.79
like whoops giant dents in the road or

2292.97 --> 2297.4399999999996
whatever or maybe even crush a giant

2295.79 --> 2301.0099999999998
food that kind of [ __ ] that would suck

2297.44 --> 2305.15
but at least they could then just pick

2301.01 --> 2308.0
it up again and not yeah having to

2305.15 --> 2310.13
prepare build new stuff just for damage

2308.0 --> 2312.29
control know if you have big people you

2310.13 --> 2314.54
have giants there to just pick it up and

2312.29 --> 2316.819
correct a mistake really quickly and

2314.54 --> 2320.299
that is just an advantage that you can

2316.819 --> 2324.049
get when you just have all small humans

2320.299 --> 2326.24
and devices that they operate you're

2324.049 --> 2328.79
never gonna have that advantage so yeah

2326.24 --> 2330.1699999999996
Giants it's essential they had to be

2328.79 --> 2335.049
there or they couldn't have built all

2330.17 --> 2335.049
that that's my opinion about it

2344.27 --> 2346.84
yeah

2359.92 --> 2364.589
hmm right chopsticks

2385.81 --> 2388.81
exactly

2408.08 --> 2414.23
yeah Karen be careful what you wish for

2411.73 --> 2418.52
you know a giant friends are awesome

2414.23 --> 2425.29
very useful but yeah unless you actually

2418.52 --> 2429.95
have some high voltage fields generator

2425.29 --> 2436.25
to nourish them they're gonna cost a lot

2429.95 --> 2440.99
of food maintenance a lot think of the

2436.25 --> 2442.87
size increase and then they basically

2440.99 --> 2445.79
the three dimensional exponential weight

2442.87 --> 2451.64
increase and then how much that requires

2445.79 --> 2455.99
in food the person twice my size would

2451.64 --> 2460.7599999999998
probably eat twice or three times as

2455.99 --> 2466.1899999999996
much so yeah a person that would be 10

2460.76 --> 2469.75
times my size you know would they eat a

2466.19 --> 2469.75
hundred times as much

2470.87 --> 2474.97
even more you know it's gonna be a

2473.54 --> 2477.2599999999998
problem

2474.97 --> 2480.2
unless you have a very convenient

2477.26 --> 2482.3900000000003
pyramid for them to feed themselves off

2480.2 --> 2484.9399999999996
and they're also gonna flourish at the

2482.39 --> 2488.5699999999997
same time but yeah otherwise it's gonna

2484.94 --> 2492.46
be a hungry hungry giant so it can be

2488.57 --> 2496.8500000000004
really nice they still need to eat a lot

2492.46 --> 2498.92
right we're a giant could be vegan well

2496.85 --> 2504.13
goody then that means it's gonna eat a

2498.92 --> 2504.13
lot of freaking plants day Lots

2508.08 --> 2515.47
Jude needs multiple farmers just

2512.59 --> 2522.8700000000003
dedicated just to providing food for

2515.47 --> 2522.87
that giant all year round just one giant

2531.09 --> 2536.82
all right I got a toe in the house yeah

2534.57 --> 2541.29
I'm not providing well oh by the way I

2536.82 --> 2545.7200000000003
got only cheapo can't see in chat I mean

2541.29 --> 2545.72
in the panel hello

2548.68 --> 2555.58
you're wrong hello hey how are you doing

2553.24 --> 2561.3999999999996
they're doing so good

2555.58 --> 2565.65
I just eat chips one of my favorite

2561.4 --> 2571.84
topics as well as all the other temples

2565.65 --> 2573.79
but I just wanted to ask you you know

2571.84 --> 2578.71
because you know about health and all

2573.79 --> 2584.02
the rest of it have you ever heard of

2578.71 --> 2585.79
Zamzam water no the name doesn't sound

2584.02 --> 2590.83
familiar

2585.79 --> 2592.33
now I myself evidently I heard it before

2590.83 --> 2599.16
but I didn't know exactly what it was

2592.33 --> 2608.2799999999997
when I looked into it it's actually like

2599.16 --> 2608.2799999999997
they call it a miracle water right and

2609.9 --> 2615.06
it's got some pretty amazing properties

2612.34 --> 2620.26
to it you can conduct that electricity

2615.06 --> 2624.93
it can purify dirty water and turn it to

2620.26 --> 2624.9300000000003
itself it can't be frozen

2627.51 --> 2632.98
unless it's diluted one drop to a

2630.91 --> 2641.56
thousand drops of normal water then it

2632.98 --> 2646.48
can be frozen okay weird and looking

2641.56 --> 2648.46
into it further you know there's a lot

2646.48 --> 2651.85
of videos out there showing what it can

2648.46 --> 2655.29
do but there's a doctor and the name of

2651.85 --> 2657.7599999999998
the doctor I fail to remember right now

2655.29 --> 2660.21
but it's a Japanese name so all you got

2657.76 --> 2665.6200000000003
a search on youtube is the miracles of

2660.21 --> 2668.95
Zamzam water by doctor and it should

2665.62 --> 2671.71
just come up and what's amazing about

2668.95 --> 2679.3599999999997
this is that they talk about the body

2671.71 --> 2682.5
being yessum

2679.36 --> 2684.3700000000003
is it like a continuation of dr. emoto's

2682.5 --> 2685.75
experiments because he did do

2684.37 --> 2689.8599999999997
experiments with that water and

2685.75 --> 2692.79
intention effects of all that that's

2689.86 --> 2695.55
correct it could be the same doctor or I

2692.79 --> 2698.68
mean because they use a different name

2695.55 --> 2700.51
Emoto might be me murder could be the

2698.68 --> 2707.58
last name but this name seemed to be

2700.51 --> 2707.5800000000004
like mom Maru something you know but

2709.58 --> 2715.35
basically he'd already done those

2712.29 --> 2717.3
previous tests and so then while he was

2715.35 --> 2722.3689999999997
doing the test he got asked you know

2717.3 --> 2723.869
have you tried Zamzam water and he

2722.369 --> 2725.94
worked out that he couldn't freeze it

2723.869 --> 2733.83
until he diluted it down to a thousand

2725.94 --> 2736.11
and then he he basically froze that

2733.83 --> 2738.54
slowly condition you know gradually so

2736.11 --> 2741.35
the crystals would form and when he

2738.54 --> 2744.54
looked at the looked at the crystals

2741.35 --> 2752.8199999999997
there was like a pattern on top of each

2744.54 --> 2755.97
other and so they the muslim who offered

2752.82 --> 2759.0
him the idea came in played Quranic

2755.97 --> 2760.77
verses over the water and then they

2759.0 --> 2765.99
froze it and they got the most amazing

2760.77 --> 2768.84
patterns after it was blessed and so

2765.99 --> 2772.56
write the story of the story of this

2768.84 --> 2775.08
water goes back to the wife of Abraham

2772.56 --> 2779.43
in the Bible and she's running to find

2775.08 --> 2782.43
water for her child you know and the

2779.43 --> 2785.7
same Gabriel that gave Muhammad Quran

2782.43 --> 2790.2
came down and struck the ground with his

2785.7 --> 2794.0099999999998
wing and created a hole and created the

2790.2 --> 2798.02
spring basically and that that zem zem

2794.01 --> 2803.82
spring well is still there today and

2798.02 --> 2809.19
it's in side Mecca about 20 meters from

2803.82 --> 2810.0800000000004
the Kaaba so no key yeah I've heard of

2809.19 --> 2814.65
that before

2810.08 --> 2816.42
so yeah this is the stuff you know you

2814.65 --> 2819.6
don't hear any other thing but the

2816.42 --> 2821.82
rhetoric from the from the news

2819.6 --> 2823.74
so therefore well propaganda I like to

2821.82 --> 2829.06
call it passes but out for all the

2823.74 --> 2832.87
Hebrew speakers but it's

2829.06 --> 2835.09
the amazing thing is is that you can see

2832.87 --> 2837.67
people with videos of this water and

2835.09 --> 2838.9300000000003
it's it's you could say it's like

2837.67 --> 2843.04
looking through a glass but it's even

2838.93 --> 2846.7599999999998
more than that it's it's it's crazy

2843.04 --> 2850.72
it's got no sodium then silica nothing

2846.76 --> 2855.8500000000004
like that in it and it's a pH of seven

2850.72 --> 2857.5299999999997
point eight and you can't used to be

2855.85 --> 2859.72
able to take as much as you liked out of

2857.53 --> 2862.57
Saudi Arabia but now you can you're only

2859.72 --> 2865.6299999999997
limited to five liters and you can only

2862.57 --> 2868.96
buy it at the airport yeah all right

2865.63 --> 2870.34
yeah but you can still get it and I

2868.96 --> 2877.44
guess people can send it to you and

2870.34 --> 2877.44
stuff but there's a guy on YouTube and

2877.47 --> 2886.06
he he basically sees it he drinks water

2883.66 --> 2889.5099999999998
all the time and he nobody has tap water

2886.06 --> 2890.77
with three slices of lemon right and you

2889.51 --> 2892.48
know we've all had lemon water it's

2890.77 --> 2895.45
quite nice

2892.48 --> 2902.5
he said it's better than that you know

2895.45 --> 2906.1299999999997
so you can imagine you know what did my

2902.5 --> 2907.72
taste like but I just think it's amazing

2906.13 --> 2910.7200000000003
that don't even have to do anything to

2907.72 --> 2914.7999999999997
the well and it can conduct the

2910.72 --> 2918.8399999999997
electricity like salt water but you

2914.8 --> 2918.84
drink seawater and what happens

2921.349 --> 2926.599
well that's actually not really good for

2924.38 --> 2928.4
you yeah exactly

2926.599 --> 2933.44
you keep drinking seawater you you'll

2928.4 --> 2938.15
just die then you get like saturated

2933.44 --> 2941.9
with salt and it'll actually just remove

2938.15 --> 2944.2400000000002
more yeah good water from your system

2941.9 --> 2948.07
they'll dry you out of it and you'll

2944.24 --> 2950.54
become delirious in this magic water

2948.07 --> 2954.02
given water miracle water whatever you

2950.54 --> 2962.0299999999997
want to call it has been around since

2954.02 --> 2967.91
the time of the Bible and it's still

2962.03 --> 2971.03
available today right and I just you

2967.91 --> 2976.43
know I I think I think it's incredible

2971.03 --> 2978.44
yeah well look I am I'm not even seeing

2976.43 --> 2981.2
it how the sounds really harsh but I'm

2978.44 --> 2986.06
not even seeing it at that super special

2981.2 --> 2988.0989999999997
because I've dealt with effects of what

2986.06 --> 2991.599
you can do with water like I use a

2988.099 --> 2995.23
penalize err and that is just a a

2991.599 --> 2999.8
crystal in a piece of metal and if you

2995.23 --> 3002.41
yeah put it in the water and yeah stir

2999.8 --> 3006.6090000000004
it around a bit it changes the way the

3002.41 --> 3009.19
water behaves visibly and it tastes

3006.609 --> 3012.0989999999997
different and creatures like plants

3009.19 --> 3014.65
respond differently to it all that so

3012.099 --> 3017.26
yeah who knows maybe there is like

3014.65 --> 3020.32
there's apparently a legend surrounding

3017.26 --> 3023.2000000000003
that location with another but maybe

3020.32 --> 3025.7200000000003
there is just this natural crystal

3023.2 --> 3029.589
formation in the ground there for some

3025.72 --> 3032.3489999999997
reason and and that constantly causes

3029.589 --> 3034.04
that water to be like that that's how I

3032.349 --> 3036.65
try to explain it

3034.04 --> 3040.7
and when they put one one drop of Zamzam

3036.65 --> 3043.82
water into normal water it it brings all

3040.7 --> 3048.56
the quality of that water almost to the

3043.82 --> 3051.6200000000003
level of Zamzam water which I don't know

3048.56 --> 3054.62
your what it can do that but the idea

3051.62 --> 3057.02
that you're using or crystals from God

3054.62 --> 3063.71
as well so it makes it's just a longer

3057.02 --> 3068.18
process you know but here you know here

3063.71 --> 3072.11
is something you know quite an important

3068.18 --> 3073.94
because like you know when they cook

3072.11 --> 3074.81
when they spoke to the water or they

3073.94 --> 3076.43
bless the water

3074.81 --> 3080.66
well they said like I hate you to the

3076.43 --> 3082.5499999999997
water you know it would well they put

3080.66 --> 3085.91
like a cellphone next to the water it

3082.55 --> 3090.9500000000003
would create the most horrible parents

3085.91 --> 3093.95
yeah random stain like crystals very

3090.95 --> 3096.5299999999997
chaotic exactly came out of it yeah I

3093.95 --> 3098.41
that's that's doctor Moto's work and

3096.53 --> 3102.44
that was like 10 years ago

3098.41 --> 3107.1499999999996
hello for the place they shared a photo

3102.44 --> 3111.5
to the water can you believe this and it

3107.15 --> 3114.83
a photo of dolphins and it's a pretty

3111.5 --> 3116.21
amazing crystal that was formed right

3114.83 --> 3119.36
and then they did write need to know

3116.21 --> 3121.85
photo of Hitler right next to it and the

3119.36 --> 3128.7200000000003
difference is it's clear but do you also

3121.85 --> 3132.319
understand why I'm asking you why

3128.72 --> 3138.1299999999997
well from what I know about sound

3132.319 --> 3141.22
resonance you know you know

3138.13 --> 3142.75
distinguishable patterns that repeat

3141.22 --> 3145.16
harmonious

3142.75 --> 3150.319
- maybe affect the way the atoms are

3145.16 --> 3155.14
sitting in the water etc but the other

3150.319 --> 3159.05
side is just a photo then perhaps

3155.14 --> 3162.14
perhaps it wasn't the photo perhaps it

3159.05 --> 3166.819
was the joy or the disdain from the

3162.14 --> 3169.79
doctor yes now you get it it's the

3166.819 --> 3173.869
intention it is the feeling of the

3169.79 --> 3177.2
people dealing with it and that's the

3173.869 --> 3181.609
amazing part is that yeah you could you

3177.2 --> 3185.54
could write just a text on a sticker put

3181.609 --> 3187.97
it on the water and if the person doing

3185.54 --> 3189.56
that it would be their language they

3187.97 --> 3192.0989999999997
would have a reflection upon the

3189.56 --> 3194.7799999999997
meanings of the words if you let that

3192.099 --> 3197.75
same action be done by somebody that

3194.78 --> 3199.88
doesn't speak the language at all they

3197.75 --> 3202.88
would be totally neutral and it wouldn't

3199.88 --> 3204.92
have that effect so it's not literally

3202.88 --> 3208.76
about the words it's about the meaning

3204.92 --> 3211.76
of the words of the picture - the person

3208.76 --> 3215.9900000000002
dealing with the water it's not the

3211.76 --> 3219.4100000000003
intention which which made me think of a

3215.99 --> 3222.31
verse in the Quran about intent true

3219.41 --> 3227.0499999999997
intent is knowing insert in the chest

3222.31 --> 3227.0499999999997
whether you whether you say it or not

3228.579 --> 3237.23
but your intent comes from a place of

3231.349 --> 3239.4700000000003
truth and so I just find it interesting

3237.23 --> 3239.47
like

3240.01 --> 3247.3900000000003
on the concept that our body is made of

3243.88 --> 3249.79
water right mm-hmm moat supposedly 95

3247.39 --> 3252.43
percent or something like that yeah like

3249.79 --> 3257.71
at least 70 and then the cells in

3252.43 --> 3259.3599999999997
themselves you know not only another

3257.71 --> 3262.39
correlation everything is made from

3259.36 --> 3269.25
water in the Quran it says but on the

3262.39 --> 3269.25
basis that every everybody's emotions

3271.17 --> 3280.39
are how can I say I don't want to say

3275.98 --> 3283.51
channel but resonating through their

3280.39 --> 3285.79
beam that's why everybody feels you know

3283.51 --> 3291.0400000000004
like a different harmonic resonance type

3285.79 --> 3293.23
sing to you but it's like what if you

3291.04 --> 3297.67
know and from what I understand about

3293.23 --> 3302.28
you know sickness what if it's what if

3297.67 --> 3308.02
it says constant toxic thoughts you know

3302.28 --> 3310.3300000000004
that you you intend and from your heart

3308.02 --> 3313.5099999999998
and from your body everything from them

3310.33 --> 3318.0099999999998
from your being you you you've pulsed

3313.51 --> 3320.44
that out and so it's like oh it's like

3318.01 --> 3323.26
it's like a oneness inside oneness and

3320.44 --> 3327.09
it's like the true they use like you

3323.26 --> 3329.3500000000004
know like when people like I you know

3327.09 --> 3330.34
that guy won't been or you know that

3329.35 --> 3334.06
person will get in the whole atmosphere

3330.34 --> 3337.6000000000004
change you know that that whole feeling

3334.06 --> 3339.31
it's like it's like they're giving off

3337.6 --> 3341.56
the vibe that we say you know that's

3339.31 --> 3343.69
what we say but it yeah radiating that

3341.56 --> 3346.99
vibe could be you know it's like

3343.69 --> 3349.12
radiating yeah exactly and then you're

3346.99 --> 3351.6099999999997
strong if you have strength if you have

3349.12 --> 3354.5499999999997
conviction if you have depth then the

3351.61 --> 3359.2400000000002
stronger the radiation becomes just by

3354.55 --> 3362.1400000000003
your presence exactly and I think

3359.24 --> 3364.8799999999997
I think it's interesting you know like

3362.14 --> 3372.74
you know the idea that the intent of

3364.88 --> 3376.1600000000003
everyone you know the intent of I'm

3372.74 --> 3377.72
going back to the story of the hospital

3376.16 --> 3383.99
here the intent of everyone in the room

3377.72 --> 3386.0299999999997
was like to want to get better right my

3383.99 --> 3389.3799999999997
partners on the bed she's you know she's

3386.03 --> 3392.1200000000003
been she's believed in God you know

3389.38 --> 3393.77
pretty much your whole life you know

3392.12 --> 3396.65
going through Catholic school and things

3393.77 --> 3400.43
and then she's got three nuns around

3396.65 --> 3403.58
here of the same faith that can see how

3400.43 --> 3405.1099999999997
much she needs to heal she hasn't empty

3403.58 --> 3406.97
or she has believes you can heal they

3405.11 --> 3408.44
have Tinchy from hill and the but and

3406.97 --> 3414.1899999999996
the Bible says when two or three gather

3408.44 --> 3418.07
in my name there I am and so it's like

3414.19 --> 3420.2000000000003
beyond anything beyond any you know you

3418.07 --> 3422.6600000000003
know yeah I can't I can't explain it but

3420.2 --> 3424.64
it's it's that synchronicity that comes

3422.66 --> 3426.68
through you know when like I told you

3424.64 --> 3430.1299999999997
the other day I look at what comes in my

3426.68 --> 3435.8599999999997
life I look at the conversations you

3430.13 --> 3439.52
know I I just I seek I seek

3435.86 --> 3443.35
understanding for that you know I seek I

3439.52 --> 3447.95
seek I seek through appreciation and and

3443.35 --> 3449.69
or to know more about it and so it's

3447.95 --> 3452.21
like I'm being laid through all these

3449.69 --> 3455.57
different paths and tested with all

3452.21 --> 3458.93
these different things and it's amazing

3455.57 --> 3463.3300000000004
you know and then the water one is just

3458.93 --> 3466.91
amazing you know the words that they say

3463.33 --> 3472.0699999999997
right and and also the realization we

3466.91 --> 3476.1499999999996
are water a part of us so our intentions

3472.07 --> 3479.96
matter physics actly it physically

3476.15 --> 3482.46
matters like exactly there is this

3479.96 --> 3484.45
Western

3482.46 --> 3488.41
conceptualization like the mind is

3484.45 --> 3492.25
separate but it's really not it reflects

3488.41 --> 3495.1299999999997
directly on everything in you and

3492.25 --> 3499.03
surrounding you whether you believe it

3495.13 --> 3502.7200000000003
or not exactly that's that oneness

3499.03 --> 3506.05
within like know thyself it's like be

3502.72 --> 3509.1899999999996
true in your heart and be true in your

3506.05 --> 3512.02
words you know and so there's no

3509.19 --> 3512.98
imbalance within the water you know

3512.02 --> 3516.79
right

3512.98 --> 3519.22
and also like realize that whatever

3516.79 --> 3524.5
intention you may have for whatever goal

3519.22 --> 3527.9199999999996
it may be moving towards it should be

3524.5 --> 3530.59
taken seriously it's like everything has

3527.92 --> 3533.44
an effect it may have a reason also like

3530.59 --> 3536.71
you that may not be to blatantly obvious

3533.44 --> 3541.03
at first but everything you do will lead

3536.71 --> 3543.67
to something else and it's best to try

3541.03 --> 3546.2200000000003
to keep an oversight look forward as to

3543.67 --> 3549.2200000000003
where things are going with what is

3546.22 --> 3551.6499999999996
going on inside you and try to guide it

3549.22 --> 3554.3799999999997
guide your own intentions and your own

3551.65 --> 3557.83
development as well as you can because

3554.38 --> 3559.59
it should be taken serious it's it's not

3557.83 --> 3561.97
just fooling around

3559.59 --> 3564.4900000000002
well maybe it is you're like a little

3561.97 --> 3567.0699999999997
kid and everything's super flexible but

3564.49 --> 3569.8599999999997
later on it's it's not so flexible

3567.07 --> 3571.7200000000003
really you gain more knowledge you gain

3569.86 --> 3574.3900000000003
more insight and then you have to take

3571.72 --> 3577.2099999999996
it more serious can't just fit around

3574.39 --> 3579.31
anymore that moment when you know you've

3577.21 --> 3581.26
been hurt you know you're saying

3579.31 --> 3583.87
something with malice it comes from the

3581.26 --> 3587.0800000000004
intent yeah we spoke about this the

3583.87 --> 3589.0
other day I agree and I think today it's

3587.08 --> 3593.98
in saying those things that you know I

3589.0 --> 3597.49
said I said you know those things like

3593.98 --> 3601.54
take everyday you know I had I was

3597.49 --> 3603.85
really tested the next day you know can

3601.54 --> 3606.04
I can I can I love the person that just

3603.85 --> 3609.22
cut me off in traffic you know do you

3606.04 --> 3611.2599999999998
know do I hate you know do I do it you

3609.22 --> 3614.12
know I mean it was it was hilarious but

3611.26 --> 3618.11
it was it was it was like because I was

3614.12 --> 3620.69
true to myself I could I could see I can

3618.11 --> 3622.73
see these things not clairvoyantly you

3620.69 --> 3625.76
know not ahead of time but in the moment

3622.73 --> 3629.69
I can see like oh here we are and so

3625.76 --> 3631.46
it's like yeah be appreciative for what

3629.69 --> 3633.92
we have you know like I see complaining

3631.46 --> 3636.35
about eating and nil like I asked the

3633.92 --> 3641.69
people at the shop with my fish to have

3636.35 --> 3644.24
tomato sauce you know and when I looked

3641.69 --> 3645.89
in the bag I couldn't find any tomato

3644.24 --> 3647.3599999999997
sauce then when I open up the box I

3645.89 --> 3649.58
found the sauce side I didn't ask for

3647.36 --> 3651.38
and I was like well you know at least

3649.58 --> 3653.48
I'm eating you know and I almost

3651.38 --> 3656.54
finished my whole meal and I went to

3653.48 --> 3661.4900000000002
throw the Box away and I looked in the

3656.54 --> 3662.69
bag and this the sauce was extra inside

3661.49 --> 3664.8199999999997
the bag like they they put it in with

3662.69 --> 3670.73
the meal they put it both sauces and

3664.82 --> 3672.6800000000003
they gave me extra sauce so thank you

3670.73 --> 3674.81
thankful that you're eating in there but

3672.68 --> 3677.5099999999998
I would prefer to have the sauce I ate

3674.81 --> 3684.62
it without the sauce you know it was it

3677.51 --> 3687.7700000000004
was quite funny little things to keep to

3684.62 --> 3689.72
keep you you know think like like for

3687.77 --> 3694.34
example I watched your show yesterday

3689.72 --> 3696.47
and then because of the Zamzam water

3694.34 --> 3698.4500000000003
stuff I just had to go for a walk early

3696.47 --> 3703.31
in the morning I just had to I just felt

3698.45 --> 3706.73
compelled I went down and I um I told

3703.31 --> 3709.04
this I told the story of how the Kaaba

3706.73 --> 3712.82
was protected when the when an army came

3709.04 --> 3716.06
to destroy it and the guy across the

3712.82 --> 3719.03
counter was a Hindu religion and we were

3716.06 --> 3723.29
talking about gurus and then today I was

3719.03 --> 3725.48
going home on the way home it was heaps

3723.29 --> 3728.06
of traffic so I just pulled over to the

3725.48 --> 3729.56
side of the road to to watch to watch

3728.06 --> 3732.71
something on YouTube like half an hour

3729.56 --> 3736.07
and to find a parking I drove down the

3732.71 --> 3739.82
road first and then at the end of the

3736.07 --> 3742.01
road was glue guru you know and I was

3739.82 --> 3743.75
just like oh yeah maybe I will look into

3742.01 --> 3745.7900000000004
that you know it's just like of all the

3743.75 --> 3746.26
things that could could be down that

3745.79 --> 3748.0299999999997
road

3746.26 --> 3751.3300000000004
these little little things you know and

3748.03 --> 3752.9500000000003
Jesus said if you don't understand the

3751.33 --> 3755.08
small things how can you understand the

3752.95 --> 3757.4199999999996
big things you know and so it's like

3755.08 --> 3760.84
it's that oneness again coming back

3757.42 --> 3763.54
through so it was very very interesting

3760.84 --> 3768.28
you know just this this moment of blank

3763.54 --> 3770.44
content but beyond like it's like I felt

3768.28 --> 3772.15
like even though everybody was hustling

3770.44 --> 3774.61
and bustling around and then everything

3772.15 --> 3775.9300000000003
it's like I felt like when I see the

3774.61 --> 3778.21
other day we all matter and if we were

3775.93 --> 3778.8599999999997
alive we were all here for a reason you

3778.21 --> 3782.98
know

3778.86 --> 3786.04
still um you know I felt that I felt

3782.98 --> 3788.89
like I've got my own life going on here

3786.04 --> 3791.17
and I could make it or break someone's

3788.89 --> 3794.1099999999997
day you know if I wanted to you don't

3791.17 --> 3796.57
mean that it's a really it's a thing we

3794.11 --> 3799.0
don't understand you know and so I'm

3796.57 --> 3801.55
trying to be very careful with even just

3799.0 --> 3804.34
how I look on my face you know when I

3801.55 --> 3806.71
when I greet people I try not to you

3804.34 --> 3809.44
know what I mean like ya know it's not

3806.71 --> 3813.69
not lay the burdens of your inner

3809.44 --> 3816.55
worries on them just by looking at them

3813.69 --> 3818.05
exactly that yeah I know what you I know

3816.55 --> 3820.8100000000004
what you mean

3818.05 --> 3822.6400000000003
and I sometimes don't do it and it's

3820.81 --> 3825.37
almost like the world around me suddenly

3822.64 --> 3829.18
turns into hell if I don't if I'm not

3825.37 --> 3831.97
careful like especially the times like a

3829.18 --> 3834.8799999999997
month ago when it was like really like

3831.97 --> 3838.81
too much it's like out there I'm just

3834.88 --> 3841.15
like I feel so and then everybody's just

3838.81 --> 3844.48
like getting all unnerved from me it's

3841.15 --> 3846.28
really weird and I didn't even talk to

3844.48 --> 3848.8
these people but everyone just start to

3846.28 --> 3851.02
respond a nerve from it it's so weird

3848.8 --> 3854.6400000000003
how that works you don't really even

3851.02 --> 3858.0
have to talk to them for that it's just

3854.64 --> 3864.0
yeah but didn't you know like yeah

3858.0 --> 3865.59
I don't know I I think I think it's it's

3864.0 --> 3869.07
you know we've you talked about you know

3865.59 --> 3871.109
way back you know before the hundreds

3869.07 --> 3874.1090000000004
think about the rollercoaster of

3871.109 --> 3876.54
emotions and things like up to down you

3874.109 --> 3877.92
know and and the so I when I see that

3876.54 --> 3880.38
you can actually reach and you hide I

3877.92 --> 3884.4900000000002
really feel that you know like a height

3880.38 --> 3886.8900000000003
of a height of understanding you know a

3884.49 --> 3890.0299999999997
height of clarity height of happiness

3886.89 --> 3893.73
and then knowing you lo as well to

3890.03 --> 3900.32
appreciate the high more but to cause

3893.73 --> 3905.609
unnecessary lows in people's lives but I

3900.32 --> 3907.44
think I think that's where we that's

3905.609 --> 3911.06
where we have to check our intent you

3907.44 --> 3914.2200000000003
know that's where we have to say a my

3911.06 --> 3916.41
compensating this angle because this is

3914.22 --> 3919.2
actually you know making me upset you

3916.41 --> 3921.66
know or am I gonna appreciate this

3919.2 --> 3924.27
moment for a new moment each moment and

3921.66 --> 3927.72
I think I think each moment I get two

3924.27 --> 3932.07
livers is a is a blessing and I don't

3927.72 --> 3933.75
know this is so many so many thoughts

3932.07 --> 3935.6090000000004
that go through my mind when I'm not

3933.75 --> 3939.359
actually in my head do you not Amane

3935.609 --> 3941.64
like it's it's a strange it's just I

3939.359 --> 3944.369
know it's it I believe they call it the

3941.64 --> 3948.2999999999997
Dow you know the tid oh this way you

3944.369 --> 3951.44
just lit life like like the doll doesn't

3948.3 --> 3954.0600000000004
need assistance or how and I think I

3951.44 --> 3957.78
think if we could just be like that and

3954.06 --> 3960.869
that was you know it came natural hmm

3957.78 --> 3963.8100000000004
yeah I think I think this maybe I said I

3960.869 --> 3966.15
think good way to stop watching TV maybe

3963.81 --> 3971.13
where would stuff being sucked into

3966.15 --> 3975.75
everything yeah maybe just let life live

3971.13 --> 3978.3900000000003
you exactly I mean by living life lived

3975.75 --> 3980.01
you wouldn't you wouldn't want to hurt

3978.39 --> 3981.42
any other lives you know I mean you

3980.01 --> 3984.119
wouldn't want to hinder anybody else's

3981.42 --> 3986.17
progress or fails that they need to go

3984.119 --> 3990.309
through but

3986.17 --> 3997.359
yeah I think I think the lack of

3990.309 --> 4000.4700000000003
morality comes from the idea that it

3997.359 --> 4003.18
means nothing you know what I mean and I

4000.47 --> 4005.97
always liked us I always like to ask the

4003.18 --> 4007.6499999999996
deduction is it's the separation it's

4005.97 --> 4010.2889999999998
the deduction ISM you take everything

4007.65 --> 4011.73
away and you're left with the skeleton

4010.289 --> 4016.6800000000003
of how things are supposed to function

4011.73 --> 4020.849
and yeah you get things like okay in

4016.68 --> 4023.73
this aspect I am right here I need to

4020.849 --> 4026.309
uphold that even though it's not really

4023.73 --> 4031.0190000000002
important the details but because of

4026.309 --> 4033.48
that I'm gonna just yeah take swipe the

4031.019 --> 4036.18
carpet from underneath other people so

4033.48 --> 4040.92
though they don't get ahead so that my

4036.18 --> 4043.6499999999996
thing isn't threatened it's a very dwelt

4040.92 --> 4046.89
kind of approach to it all but if you

4043.65 --> 4050.13
realize like no if you just uphold

4046.89 --> 4053.759
things for yourself be honorable and and

4050.13 --> 4055.859
actually help others the reward is much

4053.759 --> 4057.21
bigger for both yourself and them

4055.859 --> 4060.99
because you get like the long-term

4057.21 --> 4063.049
respect and love you get energy from the

4060.99 --> 4065.3689999999997
bombs you build you get momentum

4063.049 --> 4067.529
socially this is another weird thing if

4065.369 --> 4070.5
you do a lot of good things people will

4067.529 --> 4072.99
take note people will feel it they don't

4070.5 --> 4075.24
even have to be consciously busy with

4072.99 --> 4078.299
things where you're involved they'll

4075.24 --> 4083.93
just feel it like there's something

4078.299 --> 4088.94
going on here with this person and yeah

4083.93 --> 4093.48
that's like the magic of God I call it

4088.94 --> 4096.4800000000005
yeah I think I think

4093.48 --> 4100.489
you know because our histories are so

4096.48 --> 4103.468999999999
rich with with with stories and

4100.489 --> 4106.468999999999
experiences of not so much the negative

4103.469 --> 4108.089
just like interesting intriguing things

4106.469 --> 4111.89
that happen to each other you know we

4108.089 --> 4114.87
could just like just think rather than

4111.89 --> 4117.29
rather than they're like you know like

4114.87 --> 4120.33
the world campfire type thing it's like

4117.29 --> 4122.64
my story's better but look at me because

4120.33 --> 4125.969
you look at my story it's better you

4122.64 --> 4128.67
know I think it's less I think it's like

4125.969 --> 4134.43
this what your show represents to me is

4128.67 --> 4136.9800000000005
is an open platform and in okay I

4134.43 --> 4140.37
sometimes forget that I'm talking you

4136.98 --> 4143.6089999999995
know to anybody else but you because

4140.37 --> 4147.0599999999995
it's like I'm I'm looking at like

4143.609 --> 4149.9400000000005
nothing and it's just like oh yeah yeah

4147.06 --> 4153.06
sorry I can't have the camera on in the

4149.94 --> 4156.0
Hangout panel and on my show at the same

4153.06 --> 4158.009
time it's it's don't know if you but if

4156.0 --> 4161.73
you do want to face me while you talk

4158.009 --> 4165.029
you you can by just having the YouTube

4161.73 --> 4170.19
window open and and look at me through

4165.029 --> 4172.589000000001
there although there is a delay so I

4170.19 --> 4174.3589999999995
kind of just like note that I'm holding

4172.589 --> 4176.4
the device of my hand but I just kind of

4174.359 --> 4177.42
look through it to get my source you

4176.4 --> 4181.3189999999995
know what I mean mm-hmm

4177.42 --> 4187.88
then I kind of forget because it's ya

4181.319 --> 4187.88
know I don't know I think I think people

4188.089 --> 4193.14
people can share what they're thinking

4190.529 --> 4197.1900000000005
with people that know they're gonna

4193.14 --> 4200.67
listen and that can be and it can be in

4197.19 --> 4202.5
any platform but I'm certainly I'm

4200.67 --> 4206.67
certainly not to be afraid to be seen on

4202.5 --> 4210.39
camera um because I'm a live still you

4206.67 --> 4213.54
know I mean I just it's just the way it

4210.39 --> 4217.87
is yeah

4213.54 --> 4219.4
like I never any other like to do

4217.87 --> 4221.5
speeches that are written I just I just

4219.4 --> 4225.46
like to do impromptu speech like in the

4221.5 --> 4228.97
moments right yeah give me - yeah

4225.46 --> 4231.97
preparing speeches like some people do

4228.97 --> 4236.05
that without the professionals very like

4231.97 --> 4238.21
waiting I I rarely do that never

4236.05 --> 4240.64
actually sometimes I have like a really

4238.21 --> 4244.3
smart SN it's in my head I might write

4240.64 --> 4246.67
it down but I rarely even do that cuz

4244.3 --> 4249.88
yeah if it's really good I just remember

4246.67 --> 4252.7300000000005
it and I'll just be able to repeat it so

4249.88 --> 4255.82
I rarely even make notes I used to do

4252.73 --> 4257.2
that at the beginning of of my first

4255.82 --> 4259.0599999999995
hangouts with the flat earth talks

4257.2 --> 4261.73
though just make a couple of notes a

4259.06 --> 4262.4800000000005
couple of word that really helped but

4261.73 --> 4264.639999999999
now

4262.48 --> 4268.78
yeah I don't even really need to do that

4264.64 --> 4271.21
anymore even just happens I always have

4268.78 --> 4272.889999999999
a thing I say there like if I'm stuck

4271.21 --> 4275.14
with something just to kind of get the

4272.89 --> 4276.76
words flying I just say well those you

4275.14 --> 4279.67
know those of you who don't know

4276.76 --> 4283.09
so-and-so it's probably a good thing you

4279.67 --> 4289.18
know and it's it always gets a laugh you

4283.09 --> 4291.55
know and I think I think the idea that

4289.18 --> 4294.0
we have to be perfect before we talk I

4291.55 --> 4297.43
mean jelly in the morning here you know

4294.0 --> 4300.84
well he'd be a silent words would be a

4297.43 --> 4303.91
very silent word world

4300.84 --> 4309.85
but the IDI who is really perfect really

4303.91 --> 4312.099999999999
yeah the idea of like being right for

4309.85 --> 4314.05
television or except that's what YouTube

4312.1 --> 4317.71
has done you know it's it's given the

4314.05 --> 4320.9800000000005
ability for people with voices and

4317.71 --> 4326.52
hearts in the comments and ideas and

4320.98 --> 4329.259999999999
expressions and and and creativity to to

4326.52 --> 4330.900000000001
to reach the masses without going

4329.26 --> 4333.37
through the mainstream in writing

4330.9 --> 4335.03
without being a toast being filtered

4333.37 --> 4338.449
away by

4335.03 --> 4341.9
and all that nonsense and the narrative

4338.449 --> 4344.719
so people can because look there's a lot

4341.9 --> 4349.909
of people out there that are just super

4344.719 --> 4353.69
talented that like may want to like be a

4349.909 --> 4356.089999999999
superstar musician but yeah they they've

4353.69 --> 4358.549999999999
bumped into what you have to do for that

4356.09 --> 4361.76
and they just like you screw that I'll

4358.55 --> 4363.5
just settle for playing with my mates in

4361.76 --> 4365.599
my garage or something we'll see what

4363.5 --> 4369.77
comes of that and the world is full of

4365.599 --> 4374.4490000000005
that you know that's right it's full in

4369.77 --> 4378.2300000000005
all kinds of types music speech even

4374.449 --> 4380.388999999999
political ideas even fringe science

4378.23 --> 4383.539
things there's people out there like

4380.389 --> 4387.2300000000005
thinking up extremely fascinating things

4383.539 --> 4389.659
that just don't have any room in in the

4387.23 --> 4392.329
mainstream narrative so they'll just do

4389.659 --> 4396.0199999999995
it by themselves and waiting for abiding

4392.329 --> 4400.19
their time until they do get the room

4396.02 --> 4405.4400000000005
for it you know some of the some of the

4400.19 --> 4407.989
most coolest things about face and looks

4405.44 --> 4409.638999999999
the coolest messages of face and you

4407.989 --> 4411.94
know information about the scriptures

4409.639 --> 4415.579
and things came from it came from

4411.94 --> 4418.25
YouTube or comments on YouTube that made

4415.579 --> 4419.389
me search you know so it's like outside

4418.25 --> 4423.289
of the mainstream where they're not

4419.389 --> 4425.3
passing around you know you know the

4423.289 --> 4427.909
collection plate and you know all the

4425.3 --> 4432.67
rest of it you know I mean it's it's

4427.909 --> 4436.339999999999
it's just an awesome an awesome way to

4432.67 --> 4438.2300000000005
to communicate but it's also a scoff

4436.34 --> 4439.369000000001
that our words on YouTube are you as on

4438.23 --> 4442.789
youtubes like give us some of the

4439.369 --> 4445.159
coolest people or on YouTube yeah some

4442.789 --> 4447.8
of the coolest things you don't get to

4445.159 --> 4449.2699999999995
do or have one view to visit you get to

4447.8 --> 4451.309
see now in like high definition

4449.27 --> 4455.3
something that the TV can't offer you

4451.309 --> 4458.809
and you know in demand and accessibility

4455.3 --> 4462.1990000000005
like that you know so now all that TV is

4458.809 --> 4464.809
really left with is just like yeah

4462.199 --> 4467.379999999999
throwing money at the screen making the

4464.809 --> 4470.9890000000005
CGI super crisp

4467.38 --> 4473.75
the storyline super-smooth out

4470.989 --> 4477.348999999999
technically work through all that but

4473.75 --> 4479.92
the real quality the real people is it's

4477.349 --> 4483.289
even harder to find in between there now

4479.92 --> 4486.079
because they've all been robotisized in

4483.289 --> 4488.36
a way in almost you could say in the

4486.079 --> 4493.639
name of perfection and efficiency and

4488.36 --> 4497.989
statistical averages and movement on

4493.639 --> 4499.9400000000005
YouTube you it's like Oh are we oh yeah

4497.989 --> 4502.009999999999
are you following the script you know

4499.94 --> 4504.919999999999
that was written for you all those years

4502.01 --> 4506.929
ago no it's just I could do here

4504.92 --> 4510.079
whatever I want I could do why I long

4506.929 --> 4513.7390000000005
you know I can be a globe or if I want

4510.079 --> 4517.308999999999
to you know but if you can say what you

4513.739 --> 4521.629999999999
want just they would just be again I can

4517.309 --> 4524.3
yeah people can be on YouTube how they

4521.63 --> 4527.2390000000005
want the way they wanted they can make

4524.3 --> 4531.59
decisions they can choose to throw it

4527.239 --> 4534.23
all around or do something else and yeah

4531.59 --> 4537.309
as long as it is sensible because yeah

4534.23 --> 4539.598999999999
everything you do do reflects on

4537.309 --> 4542.539
everything you're going to do after that

4539.599 --> 4545.03
so yeah it would be good to keep it kind

4542.539 --> 4547.009999999999
of sensible unless you just want to

4545.03 --> 4551.21
freak out and then leave forever or

4547.01 --> 4555.860000000001
something but yeah you can do it here

4551.21 --> 4558.53
you're not bound by anything if you want

4555.86 --> 4563.089999999999
to go wild on the imagination you can do

4558.53 --> 4566.63
that here if you want to go total killer

4563.09 --> 4569.09
hilarity clownish you can do that you

4566.63 --> 4572.4800000000005
know if you want to be super serious

4569.09 --> 4573.7390000000005
about something you can do that you can

4572.48 --> 4575.989
do it all because there's no

4573.739 --> 4578.239
restrictions here there's nobody telling

4575.989 --> 4581.209999999999
you what you have to do according to the

4578.239 --> 4584.178999999999
contract that's right and you can let

4581.21 --> 4586.07
your creativity be a graphics or you

4584.179 --> 4587.929
know like your awesome intro with the

4586.07 --> 4590.949
birds like it's a cool little thing

4587.929 --> 4594.05
Thanks I stay and watch it every time oh

4590.949 --> 4595.489
I caught myself actually singing that

4594.05 --> 4598.099
tune while I was working in the

4595.489 --> 4599.0199999999995
supermarket oh I'm actually singing my

4598.099 --> 4603.5
own song

4599.02 --> 4606.89
that's cool it's very cool when I like

4603.5 --> 4609.38
you know it shows it shows if it you

4606.89 --> 4614.740000000001
know shows intent it shows you care you

4609.38 --> 4619.01
know and it I don't know I think I think

4614.74 --> 4622.0
yeah my god bless your whole panel you

4619.01 --> 4625.52
know every time it comes on just so that

4622.0 --> 4628.25
you know people with hearts can reach

4625.52 --> 4632.530000000001
you and find you and people with faith

4628.25 --> 4636.29
can be directed to because there is no

4632.53 --> 4638.2699999999995
you know there is no other reason you do

4636.29 --> 4640.67
this because you want to you know that's

4638.27 --> 4644.660000000001
the that's the truth you know behind it

4640.67 --> 4648.47
and I love it you know I Here I am

4644.66 --> 4656.51
sitting in New Zealand you know and

4648.47 --> 4658.34
there you are far away you know yeah and

4656.51 --> 4662.12
we through the through the magic of

4658.34 --> 4666.2
technology the internet what an

4662.12 --> 4669.23
adventure no like well this all this

4666.2 --> 4671.57
internet it's basically as I find it so

4669.23 --> 4675.679999999999
hilarious when I think about it it's

4671.57 --> 4680.389999999999
basically two cups with a string let's

4675.68 --> 4683.780000000001
that's all this is but super hyper

4680.39 --> 4687.89
technologized it's to two cups on the

4683.78 --> 4692.36
string that's the internet but so much

4687.89 --> 4694.64
more than just you know it's not only

4692.36 --> 4697.3099999999995
that it's two cups on a string connected

4694.64 --> 4701.09
to all the people in chat who you know

4697.31 --> 4702.89
are patiently listening in you know and

4701.09 --> 4707.110000000001
hearing us you know so they got their

4702.89 --> 4710.780000000001
they've got their branch off about cups

4707.11 --> 4714.349999999999
right yeah a giant net it's a spider web

4710.78 --> 4719.48
it's the Internet

4714.35 --> 4722.240000000001
Shinzon I think to be honest though if

4719.48 --> 4724.099999999999
it was meant to be used against the

4722.24 --> 4729.32
people it's certainly backbiting

4724.1 --> 4731.42
you know because this has become you

4729.32 --> 4735.11
know this this way of speaking has

4731.42 --> 4739.82
become a way to share so much

4735.11 --> 4746.36
information and clarify so many

4739.82 --> 4749.929999999999
different things that and if all the all

4746.36 --> 4752.15
the old topics you know can be spoken

4749.93 --> 4757.1
about long enough with patience because

4752.15 --> 4761.469999999999
the biggest the biggest problem in this

4757.1 --> 4766.52
world faces is miscommunication mm-hmm

4761.47 --> 4768.38
and I think in haste I think rather than

4766.52 --> 4770.570000000001
hey thinking they're jumping to

4768.38 --> 4773.0
conclusions too quickly it is like a

4770.57 --> 4774.86
battery because of the overdose of

4773.0 --> 4777.65
information this is becoming a new

4774.86 --> 4779.03
problem is that yeah people get in a

4777.65 --> 4782.259999999999
hurry and they want to get there quickly

4779.03 --> 4784.25
and they don't take the time to listen

4782.26 --> 4786.5
so what are the things I talked about

4784.25 --> 4788.87
coming back to you reoccurring anything

4786.5 --> 4791.33
this topic again maybe I got a look at

4788.87 --> 4793.54
it you know and this thing again oh now

4791.33 --> 4796.64
I'm gonna challenge it you know and so I

4793.54 --> 4799.61
certainly I certainly been doing that

4796.64 --> 4802.52
like if there's a claims equate against

4799.61 --> 4804.08
any scripture I'll go and look at it you

4802.52 --> 4806.660000000001
know what I mean I can't just take your

4804.08 --> 4809.96
word for it I'm thinking it's been a

4806.66 --> 4814.24
it's been a a wonderful journey you know

4809.96 --> 4817.7300000000005
it really has and some really strange

4814.24 --> 4819.74
coincidences and moments seemingly

4817.73 --> 4822.349999999999
messages from life you know and it's

4819.74 --> 4825.86
just like then the whole world is still

4822.35 --> 4828.620000000001
you know out there you know like Here I

4825.86 --> 4831.95
am in New Zealand like we're like on an

4828.62 --> 4836.18
island man like way away from everybody

4831.95 --> 4839.179999999999
you know like way away from everybody

4836.18 --> 4843.89
and Australia is pretty close it's still

4839.18 --> 4846.780000000001
a couple hours away and you know it

4843.89 --> 4848.64
it's like all the worlds out there you

4846.78 --> 4851.13
know living and breathing and trying and

4848.64 --> 4853.2300000000005
striving and pulling each other up and

4851.13 --> 4856.11
they down or pushing all this down to

4853.23 --> 4861.929999999999
stand up and it's all happening you know

4856.11 --> 4867.9
and I it's such an incredible thing you

4861.93 --> 4870.93
know and so you know to me you know the

4867.9 --> 4874.049999999999
creator's magnificences like he knows

4870.93 --> 4876.570000000001
when a flower petal falls you know where

4874.05 --> 4878.43
you are you know yep the humming all

4876.57 --> 4883.08
knowing nothing of a butterfly you know

4878.43 --> 4886.92
all knowing all encompassing yeah right

4883.08 --> 4889.38
all knowing and all encompassing exactly

4886.92 --> 4894.54
exactly and i adding for anyone to think

4889.38 --> 4899.1900000000005
that they can be as strong or as smart

4894.54 --> 4903.39
or as powerful as all things is for

4899.19 --> 4906.599999999999
definition just as ludicrous yes and if

4903.39 --> 4911.13
all things take sting you know a certain

4906.6 --> 4913.83
amount of something to make them then by

4911.13 --> 4916.86
the nature of their finite and created

4913.83 --> 4922.59
right so the only thing that they are is

4916.86 --> 4927.74
sustained and I think I think everything

4922.59 --> 4931.650000000001
has a you know everything we know about

4927.74 --> 4933.45
takes a certain amount of something to

4931.65 --> 4935.549999999999
be you know what I mean there's a cause

4933.45 --> 4938.97
to it is a limit to it there's something

4935.55 --> 4941.76
there before to make it you know you

4938.97 --> 4945.3
know there's not an explosion in a cell

4941.76 --> 4948.59
phone you know what I mean so it's it's

4945.3 --> 4951.12
amazing you know at every level down to

4948.59 --> 4954.35
you know what we could study and what we

4951.12 --> 4956.97
can look at but then at the human level

4954.35 --> 4962.200000000001
here we are with a consciousness and

4956.97 --> 4966.93
this ability to communicate in

4962.2 --> 4972.97
like I heard this example the other day

4966.93 --> 4976.75
and you know it's like how much would

4972.97 --> 4980.55
you give for your how much money would

4976.75 --> 4980.55
someone have to give you for your eyes

4981.69 --> 4989.41
did the ridiculous right who need

4987.46 --> 4993.63
someone up and you're gonna have ice how

4989.41 --> 4993.63
about out you know an able-bodied person

4994.23 --> 5004.41
who's totally looking around enjoying

4999.73 --> 5006.69
the world you know look in looking over

5004.41 --> 5008.07
there oh I like I like that over that I

5006.69 --> 5010.32
don't like those type of people they

5008.07 --> 5016.2
look like oh I look you know using those

5010.32 --> 5019.679999999999
eyes are you are you really using that

5016.2 --> 5023.7
priceless gift that you've been given to

5019.68 --> 5028.5
see for the purposes that it should be

5023.7 --> 5031.5
useful you know to me and it really it

5028.5 --> 5035.58
really really hit me there that concept

5031.5 --> 5041.46
of there's nothing I would want for you

5035.58 --> 5043.23
to take my eyes you know and it's just

5041.46 --> 5047.07
like all of a sudden how important is

5043.23 --> 5050.16
money money becomes a facilitator within

5047.07 --> 5056.07
a world that we live in but status and

5050.16 --> 5057.75
everything it's all one thing and I've

5056.07 --> 5062.3099999999995
been I've been a pretty fortunate person

5057.75 --> 5065.76
and you know my my my father was a hard

5062.31 --> 5067.650000000001
worker when he was enabled buddy even

5065.76 --> 5072.96
though he had one eye like I explained

5067.65 --> 5075.99
to you but that concept that how can I

5072.96 --> 5079.05
ever thank what created me what could I

5075.99 --> 5081.8099999999995
ever give in return to the gift of life

5079.05 --> 5086.04
that I've been given and I've been

5081.81 --> 5087.93
thinking about this you know over and

5086.04 --> 5090.36
over again but the answer came within

5087.93 --> 5093.18
three seconds there's nothing this is me

5090.36 --> 5094.82
it's nothing I have to put myself on the

5093.18 --> 5101.740000000001
scale and see if I'm worthy

5094.82 --> 5104.9
you know because you know I mean this

5101.74 --> 5107.7699999999995
could be good you know they can be good

5104.9 --> 5112.009999999999
harder people and all the rest of it but

5107.77 --> 5116.780000000001
your vision they get this you see a

5112.01 --> 5120.71
sunset or sunrise or an ocean or dream

5116.78 --> 5121.219999999999
or forest you know a fish jumping out of

5120.71 --> 5125.21
the river

5121.22 --> 5131.030000000001
you know these things these are actually

5125.21 --> 5133.19
are priceless you know yeah and I just

5131.03 --> 5135.23
it just made me look at everything I

5133.19 --> 5137.509999999999
look at like wow I get to see it

5135.23 --> 5140.959999999999
Wow look at that Wow look at the

5137.51 --> 5144.05
vividness to it you know yeah and and

5140.96 --> 5149.15
the depth and the architecture hidden in

5144.05 --> 5153.56
every detail and it's also like the fish

5149.15 --> 5155.53
for example it's so bizarre that the

5153.56 --> 5158.75
fish have this amazing technology

5155.53 --> 5163.46
inherent to them and they consciously

5158.75 --> 5166.64
probably don't even know it is that and

5163.46 --> 5167.24
how much does that count for us human

5166.64 --> 5170.81
beings

5167.24 --> 5174.679999999999
how many incredible things do we have

5170.81 --> 5181.360000000001
within us that we are generally not even

5174.68 --> 5184.22
aware of exactly I mean the the

5181.36 --> 5189.0199999999995
complexity in just a sweep pull on your

5184.22 --> 5190.52
hand or on your body is is is way more

5189.02 --> 5191.93
than you would ever think like I yeah

5190.52 --> 5196.160000000001
it's just like kind of like a hole in my

5191.93 --> 5198.26
skin and look at that under look at that

5196.16 --> 5200.63
under electron microscope which you can

5198.26 --> 5202.25
see on YouTube it's changed it's changed

5200.63 --> 5204.02
the way I look at everything at that

5202.25 --> 5206.69
level because I can't even see that they

5204.02 --> 5210.580000000001
live on a natural day on a natural you

5206.69 --> 5213.679999999999
know in a natural scheme of things but

5210.58 --> 5214.95
anything I look at now like I'm being

5213.68 --> 5217.83
shown it right

5214.95 --> 5221.91
I've got eyes to tea so I'm being shown

5217.83 --> 5224.37
it and my other mind to reflect upon its

5221.91 --> 5226.32
exactly so and not only can I just like

5224.37 --> 5229.62
see it and maybe just be a recording

5226.32 --> 5231.63
device I can see it I can even I can

5229.62 --> 5234.42
even you know having motions from it I

5231.63 --> 5237.6
can have an attempt to react towards it

5234.42 --> 5240.4800000000005
yeah I can change the way I feel I can

5237.6 --> 5243.4400000000005
mask it with a with with something else

5240.48 --> 5247.2
you know and just it's just amazing

5243.44 --> 5250.469999999999
inside like I even feel my eyes in my

5247.2 --> 5253.41
head more you know like I feel them

5250.47 --> 5255.0
again you know and I just like I feel

5253.41 --> 5257.099999999999
Thai well at least my eyes still work

5255.0 --> 5259.08
wake up in the morning I wear glasses

5257.1 --> 5260.820000000001
because I can't see perfectly oh well at

5259.08 --> 5263.13
least I can still see with the

5260.82 --> 5265.08
technology in this and the ability of

5263.13 --> 5267.27
the doctors and everything to test my

5265.08 --> 5269.76
eyes because they were competent doctors

5267.27 --> 5272.370000000001
now I can still you know I can see a

5269.76 --> 5277.62
game you know there's technology out

5272.37 --> 5280.83
there and just man just your eyes before

5277.62 --> 5287.58
you think about anything else they are a

5280.83 --> 5291.21
gift that yeah they're a gift that we

5287.58 --> 5293.43
cannot fathom no valuable

5291.21 --> 5298.97
well quite literally isn't it like the

5293.43 --> 5303.63
eye is one of the the amazing designs a

5298.97 --> 5309.51
universal that even evolution theorists

5303.63 --> 5311.329
are just like yeah yeah how did that

5309.51 --> 5314.329000000001
come into being yeah

5311.329 --> 5316.969
yes we can deal up this room we can even

5314.329 --> 5322.959
not try to think of how that could work

5316.969 --> 5327.229
it is so amazing so perfect and

5322.959 --> 5332.059
universally present so yeah the eyes of

5327.229 --> 5334.669
the amazing amazing sensory equipment

5332.059 --> 5336.339
yeah and then we sit in front of screens

5334.669 --> 5340.159
you know

5336.339 --> 5342.409
like big TV screens and we and we look

5340.159 --> 5350.089
at them we look at the artificial glass

5342.409 --> 5352.28
made from things in the ground and soon

5350.089 --> 5354.919
they'll try to suggest to just bypass

5352.28 --> 5357.018999999999
the eyes at oh and just leak

5354.919 --> 5358.789
no more looking through your eyes where

5357.019 --> 5360.649
you're gonna look through this little

5358.789 --> 5364.639
line now that's gonna show you how it

5360.649 --> 5370.119000000001
looks that [ __ ] all trying to bypass

5364.639 --> 5373.099
God's designs I don't need it anymore

5370.119 --> 5375.709
look look inside this artificial reality

5373.099 --> 5377.619000000001
because out there reality is getting way

5375.709 --> 5382.039
way way too hard to explain

5377.619 --> 5385.459
so you know and I mean i think you know

5382.039 --> 5387.199
i think i think even like those who have

5385.459 --> 5390.949
been turned away just because this has

5387.199 --> 5394.728999999999
been a you know a faceful topic you know

5390.949 --> 5399.888999999999
a topic about the creator i think you

5394.729 --> 5402.769
that they need to they need to look as

5399.889 --> 5406.969
well just as I can accept that I could

5402.769 --> 5410.179
be them as well you know it's it's

5406.969 --> 5412.879
amazing you know like neatly both have

5410.179 --> 5416.149
eyes right you know we both have eyes I

5412.879 --> 5420.709
can't see them but they could see me you

5416.149 --> 5427.4890000000005
know in it and it's just yeah it makes

5420.709 --> 5434.28
me it makes me feel like

5427.489 --> 5436.049999999999
everybody on earth you know like a like

5434.28 --> 5438.659
a mother or father who gets to look at

5436.05 --> 5443.4490000000005
their child that's just been born you

5438.659 --> 5445.848999999999
know what a gift you know what a gift

5443.449 --> 5452.699
until you got a seat

5445.849 --> 5455.729
you know yeah and then it's just like we

5452.699 --> 5461.308999999999
get so caught up in the aesthetics of

5455.729 --> 5463.05
what is claimed to be important yeah the

5461.309 --> 5468.7390000000005
most important thing is that you'll

5463.05 --> 5468.7390000000005
breathe it you're alive you know and

5468.829 --> 5481.679
that is why I know that it has to be

5475.679 --> 5483.36
evil it allows the multitudes to stop it

5481.679 --> 5489.659
has to be mm-hmm

5483.36 --> 5494.909
it has to be and it has to be evil that

5489.659 --> 5500.388999999999
accepts it because there's enough evil

5494.909 --> 5505.169
forces evil or deeply grounded delusion

5500.389 --> 5507.629
and is there even a difference we're

5505.169 --> 5510.929
long and you know we're long down the

5507.629 --> 5515.249
path now you know especially since

5510.929 --> 5521.969
technology and things have advanced you

5515.249 --> 5526.169
know I'm only 34 but you know double my

5521.969 --> 5529.769
age still you know since then another

5526.169 --> 5538.07
you know another doing of that on you

5529.769 --> 5542.34
know it's like those 102 years it's like

5538.07 --> 5549.62
at least like we've been progressing

5542.34 --> 5554.67
towards the rise or fall and man I just

5549.62 --> 5556.59
you know you're getting a bit

5554.67 --> 5558.93
overwhelmed by the glory I get the

5556.59 --> 5564.96
feeling yeah as much as the world is

5558.93 --> 5566.820000000001
burning I still I still feel that we can

5564.96 --> 5570.33
give a future to the to the next

5566.82 --> 5573.09
generations you know and I we can we can

5570.33 --> 5576.2699999999995
pull ourselves out of this by looking

5573.09 --> 5579.0
back at what didn't work moving forward

5576.27 --> 5582.38
and teaching yeah teaching everyone

5579.0 --> 5586.05
equality equal opportunity but it's also

5582.38 --> 5590.1900000000005
like a moving of the front line of

5586.05 --> 5593.55
learning itself cuz society is getting

5590.19 --> 5596.3099999999995
more complex is raising the bar lowering

5593.55 --> 5599.820000000001
the bar and all of this is having

5596.31 --> 5601.9800000000005
results and influences and these are all

5599.82 --> 5605.34
new lessons these are new historical

5601.98 --> 5607.889999999999
lessons of what happens what happens

5605.34 --> 5611.34
when you do that what is the influence

5607.89 --> 5614.070000000001
actually and the future generations will

5611.34 --> 5616.74
have opportunities to basically learn

5614.07 --> 5621.719999999999
from this lesson and figure out how to

5616.74 --> 5625.11
bypass the the dangers and yeah think of

5621.72 --> 5627.240000000001
new concepts ideas that people of our

5625.11 --> 5630.29
generation my generation in the other

5627.24 --> 5633.3
generations just never even got to

5630.29 --> 5636.81
figuring out because we were dealing

5633.3 --> 5639.93
with the issues back then that were the

5636.81 --> 5640.85
biggest issue so yeah it's amazing how

5639.93 --> 5644.1900000000005
that works

5640.85 --> 5648.92
yeah it always it always makes me shadow

5644.19 --> 5648.919999999999
when I read the Bible with

5649.01 --> 5656.31
and the you it is easier for a camel to

5653.73 --> 5661.29
go through the eye of a needle than for

5656.31 --> 5663.990000000001
a rich man to into heaven and I found

5661.29 --> 5667.44
the same thing in the Koran in the inner

5663.99 --> 5672.7699999999995
in but it's talking about judge of the

5667.44 --> 5679.82
Campbell has gone through the I so yeah

5672.77 --> 5684.4800000000005
we kind of shocked me because you know

5679.82 --> 5693.42
there are some serious rich people you

5684.48 --> 5697.259999999999
know and I don't know yes but they're

5693.42 --> 5699.63
suffering yeah that's how I see it I

5697.26 --> 5702.09
like yeah I'm not even gonna pretend

5699.63 --> 5704.58
like there's something good about it

5702.09 --> 5706.59
they're suffering under the weight of it

5704.58 --> 5708.48
and it's a game to them and they don't

5706.59 --> 5712.59
even care about the joy anymore they

5708.48 --> 5716.4
just want to win or something in some

5712.59 --> 5720.99
way some fanatical drive to make them

5716.4 --> 5725.969999999999
win in some way to them and they don't

5720.99 --> 5727.95
enjoy that they don't really make an XP

5725.97 --> 5730.17
thing they can temporarily drown in it

5727.95 --> 5733.62
but they will always be confronted from

5730.17 --> 5737.01
every side of what they've done of the

5733.62 --> 5740.34
envy they create misunderstanding the

5737.01 --> 5745.110000000001
enemies that declare themselves towards

5740.34 --> 5747.0
such a person all that you know yeah

5745.11 --> 5750.62
real money make doesn't bring the

5747.0 --> 5754.71
freedom real money doesn't bring freedom

5750.62 --> 5761.45
yeah I'm just glad the power but not

5754.71 --> 5761.45
freedom you know I'm not judge because

5761.77 --> 5771.400000000001
you know the creator and he knows you

5765.61 --> 5773.41
know God Only Knows you know you're

5771.4 --> 5779.5599999999995
right they also see it like this like

5773.41 --> 5784.69
God uses everything so even those that

5779.56 --> 5787.93
do go the wrong direction exactly he

5784.69 --> 5792.0599999999995
uses them to his advantage whether these

5787.93 --> 5792.06
individuals like it or not

5797.89 --> 5803.17
exactly where it's from but it might be

5800.86 --> 5805.78
the Bible like I remember but it's like

5803.17 --> 5808.35
the man's down at the water like a man

5805.78 --> 5810.54
on horses down at the water getting

5808.35 --> 5814.660000000001
getting water for his horse in himself

5810.54 --> 5819.43
washing his face and he he dropped a

5814.66 --> 5821.86
thing of money on the ground got some

5819.43 --> 5823.93
gold or whatever and then in the next

5821.86 --> 5825.489
person to come to the river was a little

5823.93 --> 5831.85
boy and the little boy found the money

5825.489 --> 5837.129999999999
and took it you know not ran away but

5831.85 --> 5840.070000000001
walked away and then a old man an old

5837.13 --> 5848.17
blind man came to the water to wash his

5840.07 --> 5850.8099999999995
is himself its face and did the man

5848.17 --> 5854.25
who'd on horseback who soldier who came

5850.81 --> 5855.85
you know came back you know to say

5854.25 --> 5858.61
where's my money

5855.85 --> 5860.59
and he's like no I don't have it I'm

5858.61 --> 5861.489
blind so I don't have your money and he

5860.59 --> 5865.33
killed him

5861.489 --> 5866.7699999999995
what and there's like in one of the

5865.33 --> 5871.08
prophets is being shown this he's like

5866.77 --> 5874.93
what's why you know why you guys well

5871.08 --> 5879.67
yes it looks bad but the soldier who

5874.93 --> 5883.26
came and killed the soldier who came and

5879.67 --> 5883.26
killed the

5883.27 --> 5892.63
the old man was father was killed by

5887.65 --> 5894.58
that same old man yes right right and

5892.63 --> 5897.28
like another version of this kind of the

5894.58 --> 5901.7699999999995
same only key note because God knows

5897.28 --> 5905.349999999999
what you don't know type mentality yep

5901.77 --> 5906.52
you're on the boat and you know they

5905.35 --> 5912.25
were hiding on the boat the boats

5906.52 --> 5913.990000000001
totally fine and the angel I believe it

5912.25 --> 5918.15
was Michael angel Michael was with them

5913.99 --> 5922.42
and said you know get across here and

5918.15 --> 5925.87
and they were like okay you know the

5922.42 --> 5928.11
boat is you know don't worry

5925.87 --> 5931.42
and so he punches the hole in the boat

5928.11 --> 5935.41
and the water beacons begins to come in

5931.42 --> 5936.82
to the boat you know and he pulls ashore

5935.41 --> 5938.92
because why did you do that because

5936.82 --> 5940.9
because soon the king is coming and he's

5938.92 --> 5943.0
going to round up all the boats that I'm

5940.9 --> 5944.92
worthy to go on the water and then you

5943.0 --> 5946.9
won't have one that you can bill it you

5944.92 --> 5952.39
could easily repair a hold in the

5946.9 --> 5955.0
finding a hole but you know sorry it's

5952.39 --> 5960.490000000001
this type of this type of knowledge you

5955.0 --> 5963.24
know and so even he told even he told

5960.49 --> 5967.12
the devil you know

5963.24 --> 5970.12
you know after who's thrown out he says

5967.12 --> 5971.5599999999995
you know why would you do that why would

5970.12 --> 5974.29
you know the Angels ask why would you do

5971.56 --> 5977.830000000001
that cuz cuz I know what he you know I

5974.29 --> 5982.06
know what he doesn't answer

5977.83 --> 5987.2699999999995
oh it's like there's an hour killings

5982.06 --> 5990.06
he'll to the naval landing and

5987.27 --> 5995.43
the devil doesn't know what it is you

5990.06 --> 5996.84

5995.43 --> 6001.76
