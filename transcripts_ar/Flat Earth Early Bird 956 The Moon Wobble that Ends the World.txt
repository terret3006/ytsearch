77.78 --> 82.52
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

81.299 --> 85.92
bird number

join button they'll be much appreciated

112.56 --> 119.71900000000001
so yeah the weather today

116.46 --> 119.719
is finally cleared up

120.18 --> 124.21900000000001
it's been raining a lot yesterday

124.5 --> 129.78
uh yeah it's actually been raining so

127.14 --> 132.18
much yesterday

129.78 --> 136.4
that apparently in the Western Germany

132.18 --> 136.4
there's now massive floods happening

136.44 --> 140.459
seems to happen in certain regions over

138.66 --> 143.459
there

140.459 --> 145.5
like periodically

143.459 --> 147.62
it's not the first time I see it in the

145.5 --> 147.62
news

150.06 --> 154.14000000000001
but over here it's yeah it's finally

152.28 --> 156.36
cleared up

154.14 --> 158.879
some blue bits

156.36 --> 161.34
wind is die down a little and yeah

158.879 --> 164.459
there's some nice Sun actually I think

161.34 --> 166.44
the temperature also went up

164.459 --> 169.379
it's a lot of

166.44 --> 171.0
Garden Work suddenly being done after

169.379 --> 172.67999999999998
the rains ended

171.0 --> 174.48
because I think they were like in the

172.68 --> 177.18
middle of a schedule and when it rains

174.48 --> 179.28
that heavily they don't they just wait

177.18 --> 180.48000000000002
so they're now all the wheat whackers

179.28 --> 183.98
out there

180.48 --> 183.98
well going at it and

187.8 --> 191.239
right at least it's not like right

189.959 --> 196.04
underneath

191.239 --> 196.04
here so it's not that super noisy

196.44 --> 198.85999999999999
right

200.519 --> 202.94
oh

206.76 --> 212.599
hello Rob H first in chat ah I got your

210.299 --> 212.59900000000002
email

215.58 --> 225.56
right so it's oh it's Friday already

219.5 --> 225.56
Friday Friday the 16th of July 2021

227.819 --> 232.379
yeah the Rope 8 sent me an email

230.459 --> 235.81900000000002
yesterday

232.379 --> 235.819
quite a silly article

238.019 --> 248.12
newest heliocentric based fear porn

241.86 --> 248.12
but it's so just funny and silly to me

248.879 --> 255.12
but apparently now NASA is saying

252.659 --> 258.84
that there is some weird

255.12 --> 259.799
moon event supposed to happen in 2030 or

258.84 --> 262.94
something

259.799 --> 262.94
a wobble

268.62 --> 271.4
goody

272.28 --> 277.58
you gotta love early internet

274.74 --> 280.38
disconnections

277.58 --> 283.03999999999996
okay I didn't know don't know where I

280.38 --> 283.04
got caught off

283.979 --> 288.24
right yeah hello seeking star water

286.8 --> 291.0
yes

288.24 --> 292.44
yeah Moon Wobble that sounds super scary

291.0 --> 294.96
doesn't it

292.44 --> 299.54
it just

294.96 --> 299.53999999999996
it's very funny to me

312.78 --> 315.44
all right

322.08 --> 325.979
but yeah

323.759 --> 327.47900000000004
but there is a thing you know

325.979 --> 330.24
um

327.479 --> 333.59999999999997
maybe NASA knows something we don't and

330.24 --> 336.0
there might be some floods like unusual

333.6 --> 337.199
flood activity maybe like a magnetic

336.0 --> 340.38
Spike

337.199 --> 342.0
Angel spoons get a little aggressive

340.38 --> 344.94
something

342.0 --> 346.5
right and they're just saying Moon

344.94 --> 350.1
Wobble

346.5 --> 351.36
as a cover story a causal cover story

350.1 --> 354.62
right

351.36 --> 354.62
so who knows

355.319 --> 359.72
this is completely out of nowhere

357.06 --> 359.72
nonsense

359.88 --> 366.479
or is the Moon Wobble simply like a

363.5 --> 369.5
heliocentric Story cover story it's yeah

366.479 --> 369.5
coverster right

370.44 --> 375.979
yeah Dusseldorf is very flooded yeah the

373.139 --> 375.979
west of Germany

379.44 --> 385.1
in a way I'm surprised it keeps

382.319 --> 385.1
happening over there

386.039 --> 392.28
I mean the Netherlands has a lot of rain

389.52 --> 393.78
and we never have floods like that

392.28 --> 397.08
like

393.78 --> 399.5
one time it happened way in the south of

397.08 --> 399.5
our country

399.78 --> 403.61999999999995
was it

401.46 --> 408.31899999999996
like somewhere 10 years ago

403.62 --> 408.319
it just it it never happens

410.699 --> 416.46000000000004
but yeah it it seems to periodically

413.16 --> 417.78000000000003
happen in Germany because it comes in

416.46 --> 419.58
the news every now and then I remember

417.78 --> 423.11999999999995
it throughout my life

419.58 --> 425.28
the 90s in the early 2000s like it just

423.12 --> 427.44
keeps happening and I'm wondering like

425.28 --> 430.25899999999996
how can that keep happening

427.44 --> 433.68
how come they still get caught up by

430.259 --> 437.34000000000003
floods like don't they know

433.68 --> 439.68
like how this brain Dynamics work don't

437.34 --> 442.69899999999996
they have like

439.68 --> 442.699
water security

443.16 --> 448.74
like a system

445.8 --> 451.8
to account for when such things happen

448.74 --> 453.96000000000004
because they seem to happen periodically

451.8 --> 457.8
why does this have to keep on causing

453.96 --> 460.75899999999996
damage all the time that's my my cure my

457.8 --> 460.759
curiosity about it

471.3 --> 475.139
I mean I'm pretty sure that like if you

473.879 --> 476.46000000000004
let

475.139 --> 480.08
Dutch

476.46 --> 480.08
polar technicians

480.36 --> 486.24
yeah water planners and that's a whole

483.539 --> 487.8
like profession here

486.24 --> 490.979
right

487.8 --> 493.62
I think that if you let those guys like

490.979 --> 497.15999999999997
try to work together with these regions

493.62 --> 501.379
in West Germany that they could probably

497.16 --> 501.379
figure something out to at least

501.72 --> 507.06
contain most of the damage

505.259 --> 508.91900000000004
whenever this sort of thing happens

507.06 --> 512.78
right

508.919 --> 512.78
it's just me thinking again

513.24 --> 517.26
maybe they're already on it maybe it's

515.399 --> 519.899
just really difficult territory because

517.26 --> 521.58
it's more mountainous etc etc I don't

519.899 --> 523.459
know for sure right it's a different

521.58 --> 526.98
type of

523.459 --> 528.779
topography the landscape in West Germany

526.98 --> 530.76
as it is in the Netherlands and Alice is

528.779 --> 534.0
really just River Mound land it's all

530.76 --> 535.14
very flat just a bunch of very very soft

534.0 --> 537.48
Hills

535.14 --> 539.9399999999999
Germany is much more

537.48 --> 543.32
bigger Hills

539.94 --> 543.32
different heights

543.42 --> 549.24
and also mountains so it might work

547.32 --> 551.4590000000001
differently and who knows maybe it's

549.24 --> 554.1800000000001
like the ground is different too Etc you

551.459 --> 554.18
know it's always

555.6 --> 561.44
more complicated than people on the

558.54 --> 561.4399999999999
surface would realize

561.779 --> 564.62
all right anyway

569.7 --> 574.9200000000001
see me traveler how bad are yeah welcome

572.1 --> 576.899
to the show

574.92 --> 579.92
how bad are these floods in the Western

576.899 --> 579.92
Europe well it

583.2 --> 587.36
there seem to be a lot of people missing

588.959 --> 594.14
in the flood it's proper flood chaos

591.72 --> 594.14
right

595.019 --> 599.36
let me see if I can find the latest

608.3 --> 611.4799999999999
come on

617.339 --> 622.0400000000001
I can't find it where did I see that

636.779 --> 642.3
oh oh whoa [ __ ]

640.38 --> 648.24
what

642.3 --> 651.12
oh damn it seems I spoke too soon I just

648.24 --> 652.98
looking at the news right now and there

651.12 --> 654.66
seems to be floods in the south of the

652.98 --> 657.9590000000001
Netherlands as well

654.66 --> 660.1999999999999
goody well they do get it more often

657.959 --> 660.1999999999999
though

660.36 --> 667.22
I already disclaimed that but [ __ ]

662.839 --> 667.22
apparently they got it like

668.1 --> 675.0
yeah that's like it it lose at least two

670.86 --> 677.54
or three feet of water [ __ ]

675.0 --> 681.12
right and yes for the West Germany

677.54 --> 684.12
according to this number

681.12 --> 686.72
news of no reason to suspect it's wrong

684.12 --> 689.839
in any way politicized

686.72 --> 694.8000000000001
300 missing and

689.839 --> 697.0400000000001
59 confirmed killed in West Germany so

694.8 --> 697.04
far

704.1 --> 710.82
right so apparently the most southern

707.579 --> 715.04
Southern province

710.82 --> 715.0400000000001
of the Netherlands is also flooded now

727.38 --> 733.579
okay new Constantino good to see you AGM

730.92 --> 733.579
hello

749.94 --> 756.24
yeah right yeah Rob H look if we're

752.82 --> 759.0
gonna have to wait until 2030 to see if

756.24 --> 761.88
anything happens dude by the time it's

759.0 --> 763.86
20 30 will be so unbelievably

761.88 --> 766.8
preoccupied

763.86 --> 767.88
by how unbelievably different everything

766.8 --> 770.2199999999999
is

767.88 --> 773.16
because of just like this crazy dance

770.22 --> 775.26
that just never stopped

773.16 --> 778.26
who knows if there's even gonna be like

775.26 --> 781.139
social media around in the same way it

778.26 --> 783.72
is now at that time right we're gonna be

781.139 --> 786.42
completely preoccupied like it might

783.72 --> 788.279
actually happen it'll be like what oh

786.42 --> 790.4399999999999
okay whatever

788.279 --> 791.399
put that on top of everything else why

790.44 --> 794.0
not

791.399 --> 794.0
right

794.16 --> 800.899
who knows where we're gonna be at in 10

797.04 --> 800.899
years or in nine years from now

801.54 --> 806.2199999999999
so yeah let's not wait on it and let's

804.12 --> 808.44
just deal with everything

806.22 --> 810.98
as it happens

808.44 --> 810.98
ah

827.94 --> 830.5400000000001
all right

833.839 --> 842.22
so right yeah that's about it that's my

838.44 --> 845.0
info concerning the Moon Wobble that

842.22 --> 845.0
ends the world

846.18 --> 851.9399999999999
doesn't really

849.0 --> 855.26
but who knows man who knows what kind of

851.94 --> 855.2600000000001
weird stuff could be

855.48 --> 861.899
could be involved in why they even chose

859.199 --> 865.019
to describe it like this maybe the Moon

861.899 --> 867.24
is gonna make a wobble right and it

865.019 --> 868.62
might not be like the presuppositional

867.24 --> 871.26
ball

868.62 --> 873.42
Universe based type of wobble because

871.26 --> 875.76
that's its own mechanics I've heard of

873.42 --> 880.26
it before it's like orbital wobbles and

875.76 --> 883.5
blah has to do with the spin and axes of

880.26 --> 886.68
the spin blah blah blah right but maybe

883.5 --> 889.459
the moon is going to make a wobble in

886.68 --> 893.0999999999999
another fashion and say like it's just

889.459 --> 895.5
yeah randomly thought up what if like

893.1 --> 898.32
suddenly it starts spinning like twice

895.5 --> 900.779
and three times the speed so that you

898.32 --> 902.6990000000001
like vividly see that you can actually

900.779 --> 904.4399999999999
see it turn

902.699 --> 907.199
that it's going to go turning that

904.44 --> 910.5600000000001
because the moon actually rotates

907.199 --> 913.8
it's weird it rotates it right

910.56 --> 915.899
around the center like a clock and back

913.8 --> 919.079
and forth and all kinds of things so

915.899 --> 922.079
maybe certainly it's gonna wobble and

919.079 --> 923.459
start turning like really bizarrely and

922.079 --> 925.92
break

923.459 --> 928.92
the heliocentric spell because it makes

925.92 --> 931.139
absolutely no sense and that even like

928.92 --> 933.06
the lining up of the celestial

931.139 --> 935.279
presupposed Shadow suddenly like

933.06 --> 937.9799999999999
completely doesn't work anymore very

935.279 --> 939.54
blatantly so maybe it will be like a

937.98 --> 942.0
risk moment where

939.54 --> 945.24
ball Earth spell

942.0 --> 949.139
might end right

945.24 --> 951.42
and henceforth the title The Moon Wobble

949.139 --> 955.5600000000001
that ends the world

951.42 --> 957.42
right the spell of the ball Earth

955.56 --> 959.88
Maybe

957.42 --> 962.7199999999999
this is all purely

959.88 --> 962.72
speculation

963.12 --> 966.019
our wind Style

968.759 --> 975.24
because yeah NASA

972.3 --> 978.66
through their channels are informed

975.24 --> 982.44
about weird little things that are gonna

978.66 --> 984.36
happen they do know that in advance

982.44 --> 988.019
and when they know it's inconvenient

984.36 --> 990.779
then they preemptively try to spin

988.019 --> 992.759
some kind of story to deflect the

990.779 --> 994.56
inconvenience that they know is gonna

992.759 --> 997.04
happen

994.56 --> 997.04
right

1002.66 --> 1008.779
the moon wave yeah don't talk about the

1006.68 --> 1009.68
moon wave they they don't talk about

1008.779 --> 1012.579
that

1009.68 --> 1012.579
because it just

1013.279 --> 1019.759
start to have some kind of weird

1016.24 --> 1024.04
Celestial refraction

1019.759 --> 1024.04
line weird [ __ ]

1024.86 --> 1030.6789999999999
I've seen like Ballers try to explain

1028.339 --> 1033.5
why

1030.679 --> 1035.179
and like outside of just saying yeah

1033.5 --> 1038.24
it's just technology right because

1035.179 --> 1040.4
that's not easy to really enforce in

1038.24 --> 1042.74
your head like okay that's

1040.4 --> 1043.939
holographic Ripple I've seen that like

1042.74 --> 1047.6
on

1043.939 --> 1049.46
an old VHS tapes when you play them like

1047.6 --> 1052.28
you should get the rebel remember

1049.46 --> 1054.26
remember those who are like over 30.

1052.28 --> 1058.039
remember

1054.26 --> 1061.22
right so you associate it with like a

1058.039 --> 1063.14
digital type of glitch

1061.22 --> 1065.6000000000001
and since it was recorded with the

1063.14 --> 1067.2800000000002
digital device it's not that hard to

1065.6 --> 1069.5
basically force yourself to believe like

1067.28 --> 1072.3799999999999
that's just a technology

1069.5 --> 1073.22
even though there is that is accounted

1072.38 --> 1075.3200000000002
for

1073.22 --> 1077.419
micro triple seven when he explains

1075.32 --> 1079.7
about it like no no no that's not

1077.419 --> 1081.44
exactly what's going on because then it

1079.7 --> 1084.88
would have been different right but in

1081.44 --> 1084.88
your head you could still force that

1085.88 --> 1090.919
but I've heard people Ballers and this

1088.76 --> 1092.78
is all non-recorded on just chats and

1090.919 --> 1095.179
back rooms

1092.78 --> 1096.44
trying to explain to me like yeah that

1095.179 --> 1098.96
Ripple

1096.44 --> 1101.72
that's actually like sort of a weird

1098.96 --> 1103.64
terrestrial refraction type phenomenon

1101.72 --> 1106.46
that's really unique like [ __ ] I've

1103.64 --> 1109.22
heard them say that people come up with

1106.46 --> 1111.799
the most amazing [ __ ]

1109.22 --> 1115.48
Baldwin is one of them by the way right

1111.799 --> 1115.48
but I didn't come up with that

1124.039 --> 1130.66
describe just passing through an

1125.84 --> 1130.6599999999999
invisible portal oh oh goody

1130.82 --> 1136.12
that explains everything no but yeah

1133.88 --> 1136.1200000000001
it's

1136.4 --> 1141.919
ah some people just fascinated with

1139.039 --> 1144.98
their portals they just can't understand

1141.919 --> 1147.919
like what the holographic is like and I

1144.98 --> 1152.0
just think portals portals oh because

1147.919 --> 1154.66
that way I can thank euclidean about it

1152.0 --> 1154.66
uh

1158.179 --> 1164.679
shows good evidence what for that portal

1161.0 --> 1164.679
really shaking Style

1178.76 --> 1187.78
a mix of I guess they mix up the cause

1181.88 --> 1187.7800000000002
and effect of No it's it's just a dude

1188.6 --> 1194.299
like if you can explain to me like how a

1191.66 --> 1196.94
purely light-based phenomena literally

1194.299 --> 1199.16
causes

1196.94 --> 1202.1200000000001
floods right

1199.16 --> 1202.1200000000001
be my guest

1202.4 --> 1207.88
how does light

1204.26 --> 1207.8799999999999
cause flood that's

1208.4 --> 1213.6200000000001
right so

1210.919 --> 1215.8400000000001
if you insist on some kind of causal

1213.62 --> 1219.62
relationship then it must be something

1215.84 --> 1222.6789999999999
that causes both the flood and the moon

1219.62 --> 1223.76
cycle alteration whatever that is

1222.679 --> 1225.98
right

1223.76 --> 1228.02
however it is altered

1225.98 --> 1229.28
now if you're going to assume that then

1228.02 --> 1230.96
yeah

1229.28 --> 1232.34
you still don't know what actually

1230.96 --> 1234.38
causes it

1232.34 --> 1238.1
but you could reason out like okay

1234.38 --> 1241.2800000000002
there's something happening that makes

1238.1 --> 1244.12
the Moonlight change it makes it does

1241.28 --> 1246.799
that Celestial element different somehow

1244.12 --> 1248.36
and at the same time yeah the floods are

1246.799 --> 1251.6
also different there's like more

1248.36 --> 1253.9399999999998
magnetic energy there higher or

1251.6 --> 1256.82
stay longer I don't know exactly how

1253.94 --> 1258.919
it's going to be right but that's not a

1256.82 --> 1261.799
causal relationship between literally

1258.919 --> 1266.0200000000002
the Moon Wobble and floods because

1261.799 --> 1266.02
they're both caused by something else

1266.179 --> 1270.679
presumably because of the correlation

1268.419 --> 1274.24
you don't really know for sure because

1270.679 --> 1274.24
you don't know what the cause is

1274.52 --> 1276.82
right

1279.679 --> 1284.0
according to them yeah yeah but that's

1281.84 --> 1286.34
God's Dome hello

1284.0 --> 1287.84
yeah they say the cause is the moon

1286.34 --> 1291.559
because they're going by the

1287.84 --> 1296.12
heliocentric narrative that the Moon is

1291.559 --> 1298.58
the cause of the daily floods on Earth

1296.12 --> 1300.4399999999998
and then you show how on the model

1298.58 --> 1303.32
that's supposed to happen and then

1300.44 --> 1305.9
you're like oh my God I remember seeing

1303.32 --> 1308.059
that [ __ ] that didn't make sense even

1305.9 --> 1310.76
when I was a little kid because that's

1308.059 --> 1312.5
obviously not happening yet they hold on

1310.76 --> 1314.539
to the idea

1312.5 --> 1318.08
that that's happening even though it's

1314.539 --> 1320.059
blatantly it obviously not happening

1318.08 --> 1322.6999999999998
right

1320.059 --> 1324.98
they still just go and presuppose that

1322.7 --> 1328.4
that is actually a real thing anyway

1324.98 --> 1332.679
and then they continue or based on that

1328.4 --> 1332.679
narrative Foundation what they do

1333.86 --> 1337.059
well flat for life

1343.46 --> 1346.3600000000001
what

1347.299 --> 1350.98
what are you talking about AGM

1361.88 --> 1367.88
wait are you serious hey Jim

1364.82 --> 1371.059
are you just joking now or are the front

1367.88 --> 1373.64
papers in the UK literally having that

1371.059 --> 1376.12
the front page news about the Moon

1373.64 --> 1376.1200000000001
Wobble

1377.78 --> 1384.1
because that if you're joking about that

1380.059 --> 1384.1
that makes it very confusing for me

1387.08 --> 1390.8799999999999
the lunar wave he filmed

1393.62 --> 1400.2399999999998
wait are you saying that the Moon Wobble

1396.2 --> 1400.24
is supposedly the lunar wave

1400.76 --> 1406.039
is that literally the correlating

1404.12 --> 1408.4399999999998
thing

1406.039 --> 1411.5
I mean is

1408.44 --> 1415.159
that thing when it happened is that what

1411.5 --> 1417.86
media and NASA have become to call the

1415.159 --> 1420.3200000000002
Moon Wobble is that what they call it

1417.86 --> 1423.76
I I need to get this specific or it's

1420.32 --> 1423.76
going to stay very confusing

1436.96 --> 1443.3600000000001
it's something to do with [ __ ] okay

1441.679 --> 1446.02
great

1443.36 --> 1446.02
ah

1446.299 --> 1450.559
low flat for life have I said hello

1448.64 --> 1453.22
already

1450.559 --> 1453.22
huh

1456.5 --> 1461.6
right so yeah

1459.62 --> 1463.9399999999998
it basically has nothing to do with it

1461.6 --> 1466.1589999999999
right I use scroll through several Moon

1463.94 --> 1469.3400000000001
Ripple

1466.159 --> 1472.22
is kind of a example

1469.34 --> 1474.02
yeah correlation

1472.22 --> 1476.539
but

1474.02 --> 1479.96
I have yeah I don't think it's related

1476.539 --> 1483.08
in any way to the supposed Moon Wobble

1479.96 --> 1486.4
that they're talking about right now

1483.08 --> 1486.3999999999999
it's not the same effect

1500.6 --> 1507.4599999999998
Daily Star it's the only one

1504.86 --> 1507.4599999999998
really

1518.419 --> 1520.6000000000001
foreign

1529.46 --> 1534.32
are you saying that that entire story is

1532.52 --> 1538.12
coming out of a singular source and

1534.32 --> 1538.12
nobody else is echoing it

1538.58 --> 1541.299
Gods though

1545.84 --> 1549.1589999999999
freaking Google it

1549.98 --> 1557.619
[Applause]

1567.62 --> 1570.62
nope

1571.22 --> 1578.539
no no no no no it seems to be oh for

1575.12 --> 1581.539
various news channels including CNN and

1578.539 --> 1585.7
NBC

1581.539 --> 1585.7
so that's definitely not true

1586.64 --> 1595.1000000000001
no on search I see it like

1591.02 --> 1596.74
a lot of different channels very

1595.1 --> 1600.6399999999999
high end

1596.74 --> 1600.64
mainstream sources

1601.1 --> 1605.62
so this is really like an official thing

1616.039 --> 1620.679
hmm

1618.08 --> 1620.6789999999999
okay

1654.74 --> 1658.659
all right LG Zero's into it

1664.279 --> 1668.38
well if it's going that wide

1668.539 --> 1672.64
then it's almost inevitable that there

1670.94 --> 1675.38
is some

1672.64 --> 1677.8400000000001
pre-programming in it

1675.38 --> 1681.0200000000002
otherwise it wouldn't go that wide

1677.84 --> 1684.279
right they don't make stories go that

1681.02 --> 1687.74
wide unless there is like a programming

1684.279 --> 1690.74
advantage to them

1687.74 --> 1693.32
so there's something to it it's just

1690.74 --> 1695.059
very unlikely that it's gonna be what

1693.32 --> 1696.62
the majority of the people think about

1695.059 --> 1699.34
it

1696.62 --> 1699.34
huh

1704.48 --> 1709.64
hey James Brown

1706.46 --> 1713.6200000000001
I missed it what's official

1709.64 --> 1713.6200000000001
oh just look my show title

1715.76 --> 1722.36
there's this story going around and NASA

1718.7 --> 1725.1200000000001
is involved about supposed Moon Wobble

1722.36 --> 1729.3799999999999
that's gonna cause massive flooding

1725.12 --> 1734.779
in 2030 and it's going around on

1729.38 --> 1738.159
like expensive mainstream channels

1734.779 --> 1738.159
as a news article

1740.96 --> 1747.08
and my conclusion is that okay that

1744.5 --> 1749.72
means there is a programming advantage

1747.08 --> 1751.6399999999999
to them it's not just somebody randomly

1749.72 --> 1754.7
making up something

1751.64 --> 1758.679
so yeah that's probably something

1754.7 --> 1758.679
could be happening in 2030.

1759.98 --> 1763.7
like

1761.12 --> 1765.1999999999998
they might simply know there for some

1763.7 --> 1768.919
reason there's going to be floods in

1765.2 --> 1771.02
2030 and they're just saying okay maybe

1768.919 --> 1773.24
there's a Celestial Celestial

1771.02 --> 1775.039
correlating phenomenon

1773.24 --> 1776.539
and they just say okay it's the Moon

1775.039 --> 1779.779
Wobble since in the official

1776.539 --> 1783.02
heliocentric narrative the Moon is

1779.779 --> 1785.559
already supposedly causing the tides

1783.02 --> 1788.1399999999999
so they just revert to that

1785.559 --> 1791.299
presuppositional assumption

1788.14 --> 1793.159
within the story they present

1791.299 --> 1794.899
but that doesn't mean just because they

1793.159 --> 1797.419
got it all wrong

1794.899 --> 1800.539
that there's no floods gonna happen it's

1797.419 --> 1803.6200000000001
just the story they put on top of it all

1800.539 --> 1803.62
whatever they know

1804.38 --> 1806.919
okay

1808.279 --> 1812.179
Global no it has nothing to do with

1810.32 --> 1814.6399999999999
global warming or climate change in this

1812.179 --> 1816.76
case Rob H or they would have mentioned

1814.64 --> 1816.76
it

1820.039 --> 1825.559
huh okay

1822.799 --> 1829.179
wow yeah that's you were not kidding

1825.559 --> 1829.1789999999999
when you said Front Page News

1830.0 --> 1832.84
mm-hmm

1832.88 --> 1837.3200000000002
oh your face is on it too

1835.399 --> 1839.6
huh

1837.32 --> 1841.1
I was gonna show it but I'm not sure if

1839.6 --> 1844.1
you want your

1841.1 --> 1846.6789999999999
face out there

1844.1 --> 1850.48
but yeah thanks for sharing that yeah

1846.679 --> 1850.48
that's really big front page

1857.36 --> 1864.559
oh just got news from Nathan Oakley that

1861.38 --> 1866.8600000000001
the Flat Earth debate is delayed by two

1864.559 --> 1866.86
hours

1872.48 --> 1875.14
because

1878.059 --> 1880.779
hmm

1890.539 --> 1894.519
dentist issues I guess

1899.12 --> 1901.84
blame them

1910.399 --> 1916.1589999999999
hello Jim Smith the prediction is based

1913.1 --> 1919.1
on the Saros cycle

1916.159 --> 1922.1000000000001
and historical records of flood

1919.1 --> 1925.1589999999999
okay so there you're saying that there

1922.1 --> 1927.98
is like a cyclical nature two floods and

1925.159 --> 1930.38
they've pinpointed based on

1927.98 --> 1932.0
the available data that there is

1930.38 --> 1934.7
probably going to be

1932.0 --> 1937.48
some kind of a flood then is that what

1934.7 --> 1937.48
you're saying Jim Smith

1961.51 --> 1967.24
[Music]

1964.399 --> 1967.2399999999998
what

1969.62 --> 1974.1789999999999
okay terminoid

1972.62 --> 1976.299
what

1974.179 --> 1979.96
I don't know where you're getting the

1976.299 --> 1979.96
18.6 from though

2020.86 --> 2025.36
yeah tiny Womble yeah the extent of the

2023.86 --> 2027.6399999999999
change

2025.36 --> 2031.0
as in

2027.64 --> 2033.279
it would happen exactly every time

2031.0 --> 2034.899
exactly how it was gonna happen no

2033.279 --> 2036.76
matter what we do

2034.899 --> 2039.34
like that freaking climate's gonna

2036.76 --> 2042.76
change even if he blew everything up and

2039.34 --> 2044.6789999999999
set all the oil fields on fire yeah then

2042.76 --> 2045.58
it's still gonna be the same rate of

2044.679 --> 2048.7000000000003
change

2045.58 --> 2050.7999999999997
because nothing is going to change that

2048.7 --> 2053.0989999999997
rate

2050.8 --> 2053.099
right

2055.54 --> 2063.099
it was designed for freaking humans guys

2060.099 --> 2067.02
the climate God how he designed this

2063.099 --> 2070.78
realm it was designed for humans right

2067.02 --> 2073.48
so let's be realistic

2070.78 --> 2076.119
you you think that

2073.48 --> 2079.359
it's somehow rare

2076.119 --> 2081.099
that total chaos and everything on fire

2079.359 --> 2085.0
and [ __ ]

2081.099 --> 2087.82
no no that's actually kind of like this

2085.0 --> 2091.0
the shitty default

2087.82 --> 2093.2200000000003
that humans go towards every time and

2091.0 --> 2096.52
then you got to keep in mind the realm

2093.22 --> 2097.72
has been specifically designed for

2096.52 --> 2100.599
humans

2097.72 --> 2103.2999999999997
so it's kind of stupid then to think

2100.599 --> 2108.6400000000003
that God is going to design it for

2103.3 --> 2110.8590000000004
humans that know that humans are very

2108.64 --> 2113.5
chaotic and destructive at times and

2110.859 --> 2117.64
will set everything on fire just to make

2113.5 --> 2120.28
just to dominate others or whatever

2117.64 --> 2124.24
and then oh no if you do that then the

2120.28 --> 2128.38
the world gets destroyed really

2124.24 --> 2131.7999999999997
no no he's gonna absolutely account for

2128.38 --> 2136.839
that and any climate changes that might

2131.8 --> 2140.32
happen are simply part of the system

2136.839 --> 2142.2999999999997
of the playbook for the realm that he

2140.32 --> 2144.04
designed

2142.3 --> 2146.92
right it's not going to be because

2144.04 --> 2149.32
humans oh no they ruin it yeah [ __ ]

2146.92 --> 2151.7200000000003
humans always ruin it the realm was

2149.32 --> 2154.06
designed for humans

2151.72 --> 2157.359
stop

2154.06 --> 2158.98
stop downplaying God's

2157.359 --> 2162.339
design

2158.98 --> 2165.52
qualities like he's not an idiot

2162.339 --> 2169.2999999999997
he designed it for humans humans torch

2165.52 --> 2172.0
[ __ ] and create total chaos he knows

2169.3 --> 2174.46
that he designed us he's not gonna make

2172.0 --> 2178.599
the realm break just because we get a

2174.46 --> 2182.46
little tantrum no that's stupid that's

2178.599 --> 2182.46
really dumb to think that

2185.74 --> 2188.52
ah

2189.04 --> 2193.42
I mean

2191.079 --> 2196.1800000000003
is that just me guys or

2193.42 --> 2200.88
am I actually making a

2196.18 --> 2200.8799999999997
a legitimately reasoned out Point here

2202.48 --> 2207.82
right

2204.339 --> 2209.859
I mean yeah if like a freaking huge

2207.82 --> 2211.7200000000003
volcano certainly started erupting

2209.859 --> 2214.42
somewhere yeah yeah that freaking

2211.72 --> 2217.54
dramatically changes the climate right

2214.42 --> 2221.5
we can't do that

2217.54 --> 2223.7799999999997
and hey history books are even full of

2221.5 --> 2227.38
these types of scenarios where like

2223.78 --> 2230.619
scorched Paul scorched Earth policy and

2227.38 --> 2233.32
like entire countries like thousands of

2230.619 --> 2235.599
square miles of land

2233.32 --> 2238.7400000000002
maybe hundreds of thousands are

2235.599 --> 2241.2400000000002
literally burning day and night right

2238.74 --> 2243.0989999999997
total smoke and [ __ ] yeah and they would

2241.24 --> 2245.859
be like okay that's

2243.099 --> 2248.26
we got a bad summer this year because of

2245.859 --> 2249.8199999999997
the smoke and it poisoned the ground and

2248.26 --> 2252.0400000000004
[ __ ] and like we didn't get enough

2249.82 --> 2254.26
sunlight yeah and then after that's

2252.04 --> 2258.339
gonna go back to normal

2254.26 --> 2260.8590000000004
yeah those lands are still there

2258.339 --> 2263.02
climate has not irrevocably changed

2260.859 --> 2266.22
because that happened it's in the

2263.02 --> 2266.22
freaking history books

2266.44 --> 2273.04
total chaos burning [ __ ] everywhere

2269.28 --> 2275.26
right death yeah the climate didn't

2273.04 --> 2277.06
dramatically permanently change because

2275.26 --> 2281.579
that happened

2277.06 --> 2284.5
right to assume that we can do that is

2281.579 --> 2287.079
disrespectful to God in my opinion

2284.5 --> 2290.64
because he designed the freaking realm

2287.079 --> 2290.6400000000003
for us us people

2294.64 --> 2297.54
foreign

2305.76 --> 2311.5600000000004
but I'm not talking about forest fire

2308.26 --> 2314.46
smoke I'm talking about burning cities

2311.56 --> 2314.46
and villages

2316.04 --> 2319.09
[Music]

2323.5 --> 2328.44
whatever

2325.78 --> 2328.44
huh

2337.18 --> 2341.8199999999997
that no I'm not presupposing God

2342.52 --> 2351.82
right and no little G right that that

2346.9 --> 2355.98
that's a straw man Candace Majoris yeah

2351.82 --> 2355.98
we're not just presupposing

2357.96 --> 2362.46
second time the freaking internet

2362.92 --> 2369.16
yeah okay let's get back yeah you're

2365.74 --> 2372.0989999999997
straw Manning me with the little G God

2369.16 --> 2374.3199999999997
now I'm talking about Big G God as in

2372.099 --> 2377.38
the designer of it all

2374.32 --> 2380.2000000000003
which is inherent it's proven in

2377.38 --> 2383.5
everything you can't avoid

2380.2 --> 2388.0
the realization

2383.5 --> 2390.16
that the place and life itself has been

2388.0 --> 2394.0
designed

2390.16 --> 2394.0
it's unescapable

2394.9 --> 2400.7200000000003
the only way you can escape that notion

2397.24 --> 2402.52
is through delusion

2400.72 --> 2404.74
that's where the heliocentric model

2402.52 --> 2406.839
comes in because that's exactly what

2404.74 --> 2409.4199999999996
that does it turns everything inside out

2406.839 --> 2412.06
and suddenly yeah if you're in an inside

2409.42 --> 2413.26
out world then yeah hey you can actually

2412.06 --> 2416.74
Escape

2413.26 --> 2419.3190000000004
the realization that there is a big G

2416.74 --> 2422.7599999999998
God that designed it all and there's no

2419.319 --> 2422.7599999999998
other way that it could have been

2423.28 --> 2425.8190000000004
right

2451.72 --> 2458.0789999999997
I don't know Nathan Oakley it's

2455.02 --> 2460.74
it's supposed to be in nine years so I

2458.079 --> 2460.7400000000002
don't think it's

2464.5 --> 2468.54
yeah I I whatever

2488.74 --> 2492.04
now but Nathan where are you gonna run

2491.2 --> 2495.4199999999996
to

2492.04 --> 2495.42
that's the whole idea

2495.7 --> 2502.6189999999997
like unless you got some

2498.7 --> 2502.6189999999997
some place somewhere up a mountain

2505.98 --> 2509.94
that should be a possibility

2513.22 --> 2517.4399999999996
G but that's the

2519.76 --> 2522.3
[ __ ]

2526.66 --> 2531.52
there won't be another well there's

2528.46 --> 2534.099
already a flood right now clutch bear

2531.52 --> 2535.72
in the west of Germany and now also in

2534.099 --> 2538.6600000000003
the South and Netherlands there's

2535.72 --> 2541.2999999999997
literally floods right now

2538.66 --> 2543.42
they're not

2541.3 --> 2545.7400000000002
like

2543.42 --> 2548.5
Oceanic floods

2545.74 --> 2550.72
they're just heavy rainfall Rivers

2548.5 --> 2552.52
overflowing type of floods

2550.72 --> 2555.9399999999996
and then several inches of water

2552.52 --> 2558.96
basically go around the cityscape

2555.94 --> 2558.96
that sort of flood

2560.8 --> 2563.2200000000003
all right

2566.38 --> 2568.56
foreign

2582.94 --> 2588.48
this is Echo chamber what the hell are

2585.7 --> 2588.48
you babbling about

2591.88 --> 2595.5
he's right here isn't he

2597.94 --> 2603.28
did you want to say something to him to

2601.0 --> 2604.3
break the echo or are you in the

2603.28 --> 2607.48
position

2604.3 --> 2610.2400000000002
where you can only talk about him where

2607.48 --> 2614.02
he is right there towards somebody else

2610.24 --> 2617.3799999999997
because you're you fear him too much to

2614.02 --> 2620.2599999999998
directly address him in person

2617.38 --> 2623.02
I've seen that before from people

2620.26 --> 2624.6400000000003
literally like on the street just walk

2623.02 --> 2627.099
somewhere somewhere

2624.64 --> 2631.1189999999997
and then there's just guys like

2627.099 --> 2634.78
blatantly talking describing how I look

2631.119 --> 2638.7400000000002
towards one another loudly

2634.78 --> 2640.48
like as I can I'm giving a signal that

2638.74 --> 2642.64
I'm clearly hearing them and they still

2640.48 --> 2647.7400000000002
keep on talking about me where I'm

2642.64 --> 2649.2999999999997
standing at it's very odd behavior

2647.74 --> 2652.0789999999997
very rude

2649.3 --> 2652.079
in fact

2670.839 --> 2677.07
what

2673.44 --> 2677.07
[Music]

2679.06 --> 2686.88
wow now that's an old old motorcycle

2683.5 --> 2686.88
early 20th century

2701.02 --> 2703.74
wow

2708.88 --> 2716.76
yes yes Candace Majoris

2713.619 --> 2721.1800000000003
you see you're still

2716.76 --> 2722.98
not addressing Nathan who is in the chat

2721.18 --> 2726.22
right there

2722.98 --> 2727.9
yeah solid logic because just look at

2726.22 --> 2729.5789999999997
what you wrote down you are not

2727.9 --> 2733.0
addressing

2729.579 --> 2735.819
Nathan Oakley 1980 who is in chat right

2733.0 --> 2740.74
now personally now you're talking to me

2735.819 --> 2744.099
about him exactly like how I said you

2740.74 --> 2746.56
are and now you persist doing that yeah

2744.099 --> 2748.78
solid logic because that's exactly

2746.56 --> 2753.04
what's happening right now

2748.78 --> 2755.7400000000002
Canis Majoris look he is there see he's

2753.04 --> 2760.599
there in chat

2755.74 --> 2762.5789999999997
you don't have to talk about him to me

2760.599 --> 2766.02
he's right there

2762.579 --> 2766.02
why didn't you talk to him

2771.339 --> 2775.839
oh I'm sorry

2773.2 --> 2781.2
you weren't talking to me well I see my

2775.839 --> 2781.2
name highlighted in in the chat there

2783.88 --> 2790.42
or are you just rambling to third person

2787.319 --> 2794.44
whoever in yourself and you're you're

2790.42 --> 2797.079
kind of catatonic is that it

2794.44 --> 2798.64
just rambling on in

2797.079 --> 2801.6600000000003
crazy

2798.64 --> 2801.66
what's going on here

2815.29 --> 2818.469
[Music]

2826.66 --> 2829.66
right

2832.599 --> 2836.4
you're having a laugh well

2836.92 --> 2841.42
right back at you

2838.9 --> 2845.819
it's hilarious because you're projecting

2841.42 --> 2845.819
a lot a lot of [ __ ] on somebody

2845.92 --> 2849.7000000000003
who's right there in chat

2848.26 --> 2851.38
he has a wrench he could have just

2849.7 --> 2853.7799999999997
kicked you it doesn't do that though

2851.38 --> 2856.319
because he kind of gets how this show

2853.78 --> 2856.3190000000004
works

2856.42 --> 2863.44
and he's probably kind of amused of just

2859.599 --> 2866.7400000000002
like the the craziness of you doing this

2863.44 --> 2870.04
right here like how anti-social

2866.74 --> 2872.0789999999997
is this [ __ ] you know that that's

2870.04 --> 2874.18
crazy behavior

2872.079 --> 2876.819
like

2874.18 --> 2879.64
if a similar set like if this was a per

2876.819 --> 2882.099
in-person situation and say like 30 40

2879.64 --> 2884.02
years ago you would have been like

2882.099 --> 2886.54
scoffed at by a whole bunch of people

2884.02 --> 2890.079
like you're crazy

2886.54 --> 2892.66
you're right like weird anti-social why

2890.079 --> 2895.2400000000002
are you talking about this guy like that

2892.66 --> 2897.7
when he's right there it's extremely

2895.24 --> 2899.3799999999997
rude like at some point he's probably

2897.7 --> 2901.4199999999996
gonna punch you in the face if you keep

2899.38 --> 2903.94
this up

2901.42 --> 2908.28
right yeah

2903.94 --> 2908.28
you're acting like an idiot

2913.24 --> 2918.16
and I'm sure you're you think it's very

2915.46 --> 2920.68
good laughing yeah yeah yeah but we're

2918.16 --> 2923.0789999999997
laughing about you

2920.68 --> 2924.819
though

2923.079 --> 2926.579
because you're the one with the

2924.819 --> 2930.48
Disturbed

2926.579 --> 2934.059
anti-social Behavior Nathan is very

2930.48 --> 2938.7
consequential he actually behaves in a

2934.059 --> 2938.7000000000003
consistent logical fashion

2946.54 --> 2949.5
what are you doing

2952.24 --> 2958.0
that's not how why are you timing out

2955.48 --> 2959.98
seeking star water why didn't you just

2958.0 --> 2963.96
delete the message

2959.98 --> 2963.96
I'm in the middle of a conversation

2965.619 --> 2968.859
I mean yeah he went too far with what he

2967.9 --> 2975.0
said there

2968.859 --> 2975.0
but now you literally just ugh

2975.52 --> 2981.46
yeah but yeah but this is my show though

2978.7 --> 2983.98
seeking star water

2981.46 --> 2986.26
I mean in the middle of a comp I I try

2983.98 --> 2987.88
to tell everybody about that if I'm

2986.26 --> 2989.619
literally in the middle of a

2987.88 --> 2992.4
conversation with somebody you don't

2989.619 --> 2992.4
time them out

3000.839 --> 3005.04
like sorry but next time I'm gonna take

3003.119 --> 3007.5
your wrench

3005.04 --> 3009.66
I I don't like this

3007.5 --> 3012.48
you literally like

3009.66 --> 3013.74
halted this now

3012.48 --> 3016.14
all right

3013.74 --> 3018.8999999999996
because maybe I was gonna be able to

3016.14 --> 3021.54
maneuver him somewhere

3018.9 --> 3023.839
where he can't avoid realizing what he's

3021.54 --> 3023.839
done

3024.66 --> 3030.7999999999997
now he's just gonna walk away

3027.839 --> 3030.7999999999997
he wasn't gonna

3038.24 --> 3044.5989999999997
anyway let's move on

3041.22 --> 3044.5989999999997
what are we talking about again

3045.48 --> 3049.52
no clear you're not getting a wrench

3049.92 --> 3053.46
right yeah while seeking star water I

3051.96 --> 3054.599
get that

3053.46 --> 3056.819
but

3054.599 --> 3060.059
look

3056.819 --> 3063.66
he had one message that literally went

3060.059 --> 3067.559
too far right now if that is such an

3063.66 --> 3069.96
emergency then just delete that message

3067.559 --> 3073.44
right and then

3069.96 --> 3075.9
if they persist like spamming that

3073.44 --> 3078.42
message again and again or making

3075.9 --> 3081.319
exactly on the same level

3078.42 --> 3084.3
violations

3081.319 --> 3085.859
then eventually I'd say like okay get

3084.3 --> 3089.04
out of here or something right and then

3085.859 --> 3091.7999999999997
of course but just for saying one thing

3089.04 --> 3093.72
like that once if you time them out now

3091.8 --> 3096.54
you'd literally break the conversation

3093.72 --> 3099.5589999999997
it was my conversation on my show

3096.54 --> 3099.5589999999997
seeking star water

3107.099 --> 3113.94
right and maybe I was gonna be able to

3109.8 --> 3116.94
maneuver him to the actual Discord panel

3113.94 --> 3120.599
you instruct him a little on just how

3116.94 --> 3123.42
that works why Nathan gets

3120.599 --> 3125.54
a little Furious sometimes or well it's

3123.42 --> 3128.88
not even Furious it's just

3125.54 --> 3130.8
starts to talk patronizing it's usually

3128.88 --> 3136.1400000000003
in response

3130.8 --> 3138.54
to very weird evasive Behavior

3136.14 --> 3141.68
from the other side and he never just

3138.54 --> 3141.68
does it straight out

3156.059 --> 3159.059
right

3165.059 --> 3168.599
flooding is going to get worse with the

3167.64 --> 3172.2599999999998
position

3168.599 --> 3175.38
of the Moon causing the tides to be

3172.26 --> 3179.7200000000003
higher than usual

3175.38 --> 3179.7200000000003
right when the flooding is on what

3180.9 --> 3187.859
really moonshadows so you think that

3185.16 --> 3190.68
the Moon

3187.859 --> 3194.88
is gonna give a sudden push

3190.68 --> 3197.22
to the flood as it is happening that's a

3194.88 --> 3200.76
really silly thing to say

3197.22 --> 3204.319
that's really that's that's comedic

3200.76 --> 3204.3190000000004
that's so silly it's funny

3221.22 --> 3223.339
okay

3223.559 --> 3227.88
right

3225.24 --> 3231.2599999999998
yeah I already informed the

3227.88 --> 3231.26
the chat Nathan

3232.5 --> 3239.18
it seems like a lot of people have been

3235.26 --> 3239.1800000000003
rushing to the dentist recently

3239.88 --> 3244.98
thankfully I'm not one of them although

3241.92 --> 3246.0
yeah plenty of issues if you know what I

3244.98 --> 3248.579
mean

3246.0 --> 3251.819
but yeah not

3248.579 --> 3254.1600000000003
not so bad that I that that I feel

3251.819 --> 3257.599
absolutely like I had no choice but to

3254.16 --> 3257.5989999999997
go to the dentist so

3275.579 --> 3277.7000000000003
thank you

3279.599 --> 3284.52
yeah it's a very risky joke clearly

3282.48 --> 3286.859
because you were borderline violating

3284.52 --> 3290.24
the chat rules

3286.859 --> 3290.24
you know you were

3295.98 --> 3298.7
that's all right

3298.98 --> 3306.42
yeah and also seeking star water don't

3303.119 --> 3309.54
please don't feel angry and also don't

3306.42 --> 3314.4
feel bad I understand why you did that

3309.54 --> 3317.64
time out it's just that again if it's if

3314.4 --> 3320.099
I'm in the middle of engaging

3317.64 --> 3322.64
you really gotta hold yourself back from

3320.099 --> 3322.6400000000003
doing that

3323.4 --> 3327.78
because also

3325.559 --> 3330.2400000000002
when I'm literally engaging with

3327.78 --> 3331.98
somebody from the chat

3330.24 --> 3334.4399999999996
you don't have to worry that I'll not

3331.98 --> 3337.44
pick up on things I will be seeing you

3334.44 --> 3338.94
because I'm right there engaging

3337.44 --> 3341.16
right

3338.94 --> 3344.76
so unless they suddenly turn to a

3341.16 --> 3346.5589999999997
massive spam troll that very obviously

3344.76 --> 3349.26
is fam troll

3346.559 --> 3351.7200000000003
right then the timeout is really

3349.26 --> 3355.38
Justified but if I'm in the middle of a

3351.72 --> 3357.66
conversation then just don't do it

3355.38 --> 3358.859
right I'll take care of it because I'm

3357.66 --> 3360.54
literally in the middle of a

3358.859 --> 3363.42
conversation with them so I will take

3360.54 --> 3365.88
care I can talk to somebody read them in

3363.42 --> 3368.28
chat and be a moderator at the same time

3365.88 --> 3370.319
it's a very easy thing to combine trust

3368.28 --> 3372.96
me on this

3370.319 --> 3376.7
if I'm engaging right now if I'm like

3372.96 --> 3376.7
talking about something else

3377.04 --> 3382.5
and not addressing somebody in chat yeah

3379.68 --> 3385.0789999999997
then it might elude me that they might

3382.5 --> 3387.72
be saying some really nasty things right

3385.079 --> 3389.3390000000004
and then I'd be like okay wait what

3387.72 --> 3391.4399999999996
happened somebody got time that oh what

3389.339 --> 3393.48
did they say all right good call and

3391.44 --> 3397.44
that happened before in the past

3393.48 --> 3399.72
even indirectly addressing them in that

3397.44 --> 3401.46
moment then please don't time out

3399.72 --> 3403.98
because when you time out everything

3401.46 --> 3406.68
gets removed and they can't speak

3403.98 --> 3408.9
so it breaks the conversation

3406.68 --> 3410.5789999999997
there's some specific message that's

3408.9 --> 3414.38
really too far

3410.579 --> 3414.38
just delete that one message

3414.599 --> 3422.119
you can do that with the wrench so that

3418.02 --> 3422.119
would be a more viable course of action

3422.599 --> 3430.52
no harm done really this is just detail

3426.66 --> 3434.3999999999996
detail work trying to make this show run

3430.52 --> 3438.14
at Optimum efficiency communication wise

3434.4 --> 3438.14
with the interaction with chat

3442.76 --> 3446.7200000000003
okay what are you talking about

3450.38 --> 3457.099
weed whackers

3453.18 --> 3457.0989999999997
see the mic Pixelmon

3463.44 --> 3470.88
watch Moon Wobble well Nathan

3467.88 --> 3473.2200000000003
I'm not even sure exactly what

3470.88 --> 3475.559
what that's supposed to be

3473.22 --> 3477.74
what the supposed Moon Wobble is I don't

3475.559 --> 3477.7400000000002
know

3478.92 --> 3484.619
it's probably has to do with the

3482.16 --> 3487.94
presupposed orbit of the ball Moon

3484.619 --> 3487.94
around the ball Earth

3488.28 --> 3492.8390000000004
and on top of that the presupposition

3490.799 --> 3496.38
how that's supposed to cause the tides

3492.839 --> 3498.24
which is of course ridiculous

3496.38 --> 3499.92
so I don't know exactly what type of

3498.24 --> 3501.72
wobble that's supposed to be whether

3499.92 --> 3504.119
it's like oh it's certainly going to

3501.72 --> 3505.5
come closer or some nonsense they'll

3504.119 --> 3507.78
make up it's like oh yeah it's the

3505.5 --> 3509.88
perfect stable path for eternity always

3507.78 --> 3512.4
but this one time it's certainly going

3509.88 --> 3515.94
to come closer it's gonna go back

3512.4 --> 3518.46
dude they'll say anything like

3515.94 --> 3522.02
these days I like to think that they

3518.46 --> 3525.119
want to be as blatantly in your face

3522.02 --> 3527.7
inconsistent as they can conceivably get

3525.119 --> 3529.079
just to try to get through to you that

3527.7 --> 3530.339
it doesn't make any sense what they're

3529.079 --> 3533.48
saying

3530.339 --> 3533.48
but I'm not sure

3543.72 --> 3548.1189999999997
might be time to make your own thumbs

3550.079 --> 3555.599
clearly Adam's work yeah yeah no but I

3553.14 --> 3557.7
asked him I asked Adam

3555.599 --> 3559.619
it was my idea

3557.7 --> 3560.8999999999996
I noticed the article and I was like oh

3559.619 --> 3564.54
my God

3560.9 --> 3566.94
evil moon face with scary earth like

3564.54 --> 3569.88
that was just enough I just told Adam

3566.94 --> 3572.64
and and he made it

3569.88 --> 3575.48
and that's the thumbnail for today

3572.64 --> 3575.48
it was awesome

3590.579 --> 3593.119
what

3594.119 --> 3598.339
tiny Walmart oh my God

3598.68 --> 3601.3999999999996
really

3608.64 --> 3613.02
but

3610.92 --> 3616.52
how could it

3613.02 --> 3616.52
makes no sense

3616.859 --> 3627.24
if there's a regular swaying wobble

3622.38 --> 3630.359
then why does it perfectly lockstep

3627.24 --> 3631.5
faces with the same side for all

3630.359 --> 3634.619
eternity

3631.5 --> 3638.0
perfectly every time like how can it on

3634.619 --> 3639.7200000000003
top of that also have like a periodic

3638.0 --> 3642.72
alteration

3639.72 --> 3644.7599999999998
and still keep in perfect lock step

3642.72 --> 3649.799
facing the same side

3644.76 --> 3652.6400000000003
like I try to justify that guys

3649.799 --> 3652.64
the [ __ ]

3656.4 --> 3664.339
okay tiny Womble well thanks for that

3660.839 --> 3664.339
that note then I guess

3670.02 --> 3673.22
a tiny one more

3681.48 --> 3685.04
I guess that he should know

3703.02 --> 3707.66
what are you talking about these texts

3752.52 --> 3759.2599999999998
right and I I can't really connect

3755.46 --> 3759.26
everything in chat right now anymore

3759.359 --> 3765.02
there's no

3761.64 --> 3765.02
seems so very random

3765.18 --> 3769.9199999999996
so

3767.52 --> 3772.799
all right but yeah there's a supposed

3769.92 --> 3775.5
happening

3772.799 --> 3777.48
tiny Womble even gave some historical

3775.5 --> 3780.96
background that apparently it's been

3777.48 --> 3783.599
cited very very early on

3780.96 --> 3785.4
before ball Earth was even taught in

3783.599 --> 3787.079
schools

3785.4 --> 3790.2200000000003
when it was still kind of a secret

3787.079 --> 3790.2200000000003
society project

3790.26 --> 3794.039
the astronomers already like oh look

3792.299 --> 3797.099
Moon wobbled

3794.039 --> 3799.7990000000004
right so maybe the Moon Wobble as a

3797.099 --> 3802.26
phenomenon actually precedes the

3799.799 --> 3805.92
conception

3802.26 --> 3808.98
of the universe as balls floating in

3805.92 --> 3812.46
space ever thought about that

3808.98 --> 3815.16
so maybe yeah but what is it though

3812.46 --> 3816.7200000000003
I'm almost gonna Wikipedia it just to

3815.16 --> 3818.46
know what a freaking Moon Wobble

3816.72 --> 3821.7099999999996
actually is

3818.46 --> 3821.71
[Applause]

3825.78 --> 3829.2200000000003
come on Wikipedia

3830.94 --> 3838.46
tell me what a Moon Wobble is

3834.48 --> 3838.46
lunar Liberation what

3841.079 --> 3843.92
the [ __ ]

3844.319 --> 3847.94
why did that pop off

3866.16 --> 3875.2799999999997
oh oh wait vibration not Liberation

3869.96 --> 3878.52
right no okay well yay Moon Wobble or

3875.28 --> 3881.099
maybe lunar wobble maybe that will work

3878.52 --> 3885.599
I don't think so though no

3881.099 --> 3888.48
yeah goody lunar wobble doesn't seem to

3885.599 --> 3891.96
be a thing in Wikipedia

3888.48 --> 3893.039
there's no entry good great

3891.96 --> 3894.96
so

3893.039 --> 3896.8190000000004
I'm still not entirely sure what it's

3894.96 --> 3900.66
supposed to be even though tiny Womble

3896.819 --> 3902.7599999999998
said that it was first detected in 17

3900.66 --> 3904.3799999999997
blah blah blah

3902.76 --> 3906.98
still doesn't make me know what it

3904.38 --> 3906.98
actually is

3909.119 --> 3912.02
but anyway

3913.339 --> 3919.7
foreign

3915.92 --> 3919.7000000000003
I'll be back two minutes

3998.4 --> 4001.4
foreign

4031.539 --> 4036.3190000000004
but at least you can find official

4034.579 --> 4038.119
explanations there

4036.319 --> 4040.52
right

4038.119 --> 4044.539
it's not a guarantee that it'll tell you

4040.52 --> 4048.079
the literal truth about reality

4044.539 --> 4049.5200000000004
but at least it will

4048.079 --> 4053.48
just

4049.52 --> 4055.339
present to you official stories

4053.48 --> 4057.5
and that's worth something and that's

4055.339 --> 4060.5589999999997
just up to the Observer to know or

4057.5 --> 4063.5
figure out what is true about it

4060.559 --> 4066.799
right even if it's a lie if you figure

4063.5 --> 4068.0
out it is a lie then you have the truth

4066.799 --> 4070.599
about it

4068.0 --> 4070.599
right

4073.94 --> 4077.02
then you know

4079.28 --> 4081.88
anyway

4089.24 --> 4094.72
T became P okay Cleary and that's

4095.98 --> 4099.46
more the coffee

4117.56 --> 4120.56
yep

4130.4 --> 4137.239
yeah Clary yeah you seem to uh at the

4134.359 --> 4138.799
moment I've yeah I've taken notice of

4137.239 --> 4142.659
that

4138.799 --> 4142.659
take a note of that sorry

4142.819 --> 4148.359
sometimes I have a little Womble wobble

4145.58 --> 4148.359
in my own English

4153.56 --> 4159.6990000000005
I'm mostly hungry now though

4156.92 --> 4159.6990000000005
uh

4174.38 --> 4179.839
all right so anything other anything

4177.259 --> 4181.46
else anybody would like to discuss maybe

4179.839 --> 4184.48
get a little bit more serious I know

4181.46 --> 4184.4800000000005
we've had our fun

4184.759 --> 4187.299
foreign

4189.259 --> 4194.06
with this silly Moon Wobble

4192.199 --> 4195.5
and then again the news about the

4194.06 --> 4197.6
floodings

4195.5 --> 4202.04
relatively local

4197.6 --> 4205.659000000001
south of my country and to the east

4202.04 --> 4205.659
in Germany and West Germany

4207.14 --> 4212.1990000000005
that seems to be the range of what we've

4209.239 --> 4212.199
talked about today

4213.8 --> 4219.1990000000005
is there anything else noteworthy that

4216.86 --> 4221.54
has happened that anyone any one of you

4219.199 --> 4225.32
would like to share with me

4221.54 --> 4228.82
or ask me questions about

4225.32 --> 4228.82
let me know in chat

4243.32 --> 4246.099999999999
oops

4261.98 --> 4264.82
or not

4264.98 --> 4268.099999999999
because you also just wait another two

4267.08 --> 4270.26
minutes

4268.1 --> 4272.2390000000005
and nobody actually saying anything

4270.26 --> 4274.900000000001
anymore and then I'll just round out the

4272.239 --> 4274.9
show early

4277.82 --> 4282.86
I need a Discord server

4280.46 --> 4284.179
well I technically already have one but

4282.86 --> 4286.46
no

4284.179 --> 4289.76
I just need

4286.46 --> 4291.62
activity and chat that's all

4289.76 --> 4295.219
works just fine

4291.62 --> 4299.719
and hey if somebody has something urgent

4295.219 --> 4302.06
to report and I know them then I'll take

4299.719 --> 4304.219
a Skype call as well during the show and

4302.06 --> 4306.02
you can be on verbally

4304.219 --> 4307.699
instead of just through the chat like

4306.02 --> 4310.4800000000005
Nathan the other day

4307.699 --> 4310.48
last week

4321.02 --> 4324.76
are you getting wisdom

4372.199 --> 4377.08
right

4374.06 --> 4377.080000000001
so guys

4379.1 --> 4383.1990000000005
weather is really nice now

4411.5 --> 4417.98
all right okay well maybe I'm just gonna

4414.92 --> 4420.02
eat this Peach now I haven't really had

4417.98 --> 4422.839999999999
one in a long time

4420.02 --> 4425.06
last one I opened up Suddenly had two

4422.84 --> 4427.900000000001
insects crawling out of it which was

4425.06 --> 4427.900000000001
quite freaky

4428.6 --> 4433.58
felt like a snow white moment to me I'm

4431.6 --> 4436.2390000000005
very happy I didn't take a bite out of

4433.58 --> 4436.239
it before that

4437.239 --> 4444.259999999999
but they were like inside in a closed

4440.179 --> 4449.679
off thing so they had been there

4444.26 --> 4449.679
and then it grew into a peach very odd

4450.02 --> 4453.860000000001
like how did they survive without oxygen

4452.54 --> 4456.08
or something

4453.86 --> 4460.36
very very freaky

4456.08 --> 4460.36
anyway I think I'm gonna eat this thing

4460.64 --> 4465.38
since everybody's just

4462.92 --> 4468.52
not really drawing me into a

4465.38 --> 4468.52
conversation in chat

4474.679 --> 4478.82
oh yeah before the show was watching on

4477.02 --> 4483.620000000001
Benjamin again

4478.82 --> 4486.199
I've been on with the show with Jim Bob

4483.62 --> 4488.3
it's hilarious

4486.199 --> 4490.719
but yeah I didn't get further than 15

4488.3 --> 4490.719
minutes

4492.14 --> 4497.179
fruit month

4493.94 --> 4500.0599999999995
no I don't know fruit I just saw a peach

4497.179 --> 4503.36
and I thought I

4500.06 --> 4506.320000000001
I need some

4503.36 --> 4506.32
some of that

4507.26 --> 4511.46
wow look at how freaking ripe this thing

4509.54 --> 4514.04
is this is crazy

4511.46 --> 4517.4800000000005
just peel the entire

4514.04 --> 4517.48
peel off in one go

4520.4 --> 4523.0
amazing

4523.04 --> 4527.56
[ __ ]

4524.9 --> 4527.5599999999995
huh

4528.199 --> 4531.82
that's never worked before

4532.96 --> 4538.9
huh look at that look at how freaking

4536.06 --> 4538.900000000001
juicy that is

4558.08 --> 4561.46
Silence of the peaches

4564.32 --> 4567.34
holy [ __ ]

4569.239 --> 4573.339999999999
this is like perfectly ripe

4577.04 --> 4581.38
yes AGM I get that

4581.6 --> 4587.38
I just don't really understand why but I

4584.78 --> 4587.38
got the joke

4609.02 --> 4611.02
um

4611.12 --> 4613.9
man

4622.48 --> 4630.879999999999
avocados well

4625.34 --> 4630.88
I'm not really a big fan of those I mean

4631.46 --> 4636.7390000000005
if you know how to work with avocados in

4634.64 --> 4640.780000000001
the kitchen properly yeah that can be

4636.739 --> 4640.78
pretty good and they're healthy

4641.84 --> 4646.12
I just don't really like him that much

4646.699 --> 4652.178999999999
but I will eat them if somebody actually

4648.92 --> 4652.179
puts it in a meal

4657.32 --> 4665.0599999999995
unlike olives which I don't eat

4661.239 --> 4668.36
but I'll eat olive oil though

4665.06 --> 4670.64
or have that used in a meal

4668.36 --> 4674.239
a bit weird like that just like I don't

4670.64 --> 4677.5
eat fish like I really don't

4674.239 --> 4677.5
but I'll take fish oil

4691.94 --> 4697.299999999999
it's the seed inside

4694.699 --> 4697.299999999999
what

4707.179 --> 4711.92
you can Advocate avocados why not clear

4710.3 --> 4715.179
it

4711.92 --> 4715.179
what's wrong about them

4734.96 --> 4741.9800000000005
really you can eat avocados

4738.98 --> 4741.98
seeds

4760.219 --> 4767.54
okay I guess you can it's not something

4763.94 --> 4770.199
that seems very appealing to me though

4767.54 --> 4770.199
uh

4777.32 --> 4779.98
hmm

4782.719 --> 4788.2390000000005
like yeah my roommate

4785.12 --> 4790.4
who has a lot of plants in his room or

4788.239 --> 4792.379999999999
rather on his balcony because it's much

4790.4 --> 4793.639999999999
more covered up balcony so it works

4792.38 --> 4797.4800000000005
better

4793.64 --> 4800.06
like he has several avocado

4797.48 --> 4804.339999999999
seeds that he's actually growing into

4800.06 --> 4804.34
plants it was working out quite well

4806.659 --> 4813.099999999999
I didn't know you could eat them

4809.179 --> 4813.1
that's a surprise to me

4815.6 --> 4820.6
more fat in the seed than the fruit

4818.06 --> 4820.6
really

4820.88 --> 4823.4800000000005
huh

4824.0 --> 4826.6
okay

4829.76 --> 4834.62
I've never even considered trying to

4832.34 --> 4837.1990000000005
taste it I don't know I always associate

4834.62 --> 4840.04
fruit seeds with like bitter

4837.199 --> 4840.04
crap

4840.26 --> 4842.92
you know

4866.78 --> 4872.0199999999995
don't eat them in massive amounts okay

4869.239 --> 4875.299999999999
because they have

4872.02 --> 4878.080000000001
arsenic in it natural arsenic right a

4875.3 --> 4878.08
lot of seeds do

4878.48 --> 4881.919999999999
a lot of fruit seeds

4897.86 --> 4903.44
Pearson okay right it was not literal

4902.36 --> 4907.339999999999
arsenic

4903.44 --> 4909.32
something close to that same branch of

4907.34 --> 4911.78
uh

4909.32 --> 4913.639
biochemicals

4911.78 --> 4916.179
cyanide

4913.639 --> 4916.179
right

4917.42 --> 4925.96
but it's like a an organic type of toxin

4921.56 --> 4925.96
that has a whole range of it in nature

4926.719 --> 4930.32
but it's always typically associated

4928.52 --> 4933.5
with seeds

4930.32 --> 4936.44
and some nuts as well like almonds are

4933.5 --> 4938.9
very high on cyanide

4936.44 --> 4941.419999999999
but you can still eat that and they even

4938.9 --> 4944.08
make marzipan of it right

4941.42 --> 4947.42
but yeah that there is like natural

4944.08 --> 4951.5
arsenic in it or cyanide now cyanide is

4947.42 --> 4953.96
like weaponized I think not sure Adam

4951.5 --> 4954.98
Meek and probably knows he's like a

4953.96 --> 4957.7390000000005
chemist

4954.98 --> 4959.78
can't get all the details all right with

4957.739 --> 4963.44
that

4959.78 --> 4965.599999999999
but I roughly know how it works

4963.44 --> 4969.08
and I know how to recognize the smell

4965.6 --> 4971.120000000001
and taste immediately

4969.08 --> 4973.58
nobody's gonna

4971.12 --> 4976.12
poison me with arsenic without me

4973.58 --> 4976.12
knowing it

4990.58 --> 4995.5
anyway yeah that peach was really nice

5000.52 --> 5003.659000000001
[Music]

5005.02 --> 5009.6
maybe I'll get another one from the

5006.82 --> 5009.599999999999
store after this

5010.6 --> 5015.1
I'll definitely go out for groceries

5012.88 --> 5016.78
right after the show ends because Nathan

5015.1 --> 5019.08
is not gonna have a live show right away

5016.78 --> 5019.08
anyway

5019.6 --> 5023.26
hopefully he will have some kind of a

5021.639 --> 5025.2390000000005
live show later it could be that it's

5023.26 --> 5028.42
gonna be no live show at all today I

5025.239 --> 5030.5199999999995
don't know he hasn't said

5028.42 --> 5032.9800000000005
why he says it's just going to be later

5030.52 --> 5036.52
so

5032.98 --> 5038.379999999999
we'll be delayed that's what he said

5036.52 --> 5040.8
an hour or two

5038.38 --> 5043.84
right so that means that he is actually

5040.8 --> 5045.6990000000005
saying he is having a show it's just

5043.84 --> 5047.139
going to be at an unusual time that's

5045.699 --> 5049.678999999999
all

5047.139 --> 5049.679
right

5094.239 --> 5101.678999999999
I know Claire yeah that's indeed

5099.159 --> 5104.199
it's a good thing to consider

5101.679 --> 5106.12
spending the ball of dirt it's all

5104.199 --> 5109.178999999999
random right

5106.12 --> 5112.659
but then here in the world

5109.179 --> 5115.9800000000005
we have things that are just

5112.659 --> 5119.259999999999
there's no way that wasn't like

5115.98 --> 5123.28
designed on a very high level

5119.26 --> 5126.820000000001
and put together to work the way it does

5123.28 --> 5129.659
like just how a seed can grow into a

5126.82 --> 5129.659
living plant

5131.92 --> 5138.6
or how we can as humans or in other

5135.159 --> 5138.599999999999
animals can reproduce

5139.06 --> 5145.54
and like

5141.46 --> 5149.38
I find it always pretty fascinating how

5145.54 --> 5152.5
like baby girls are basically born

5149.38 --> 5155.38
with all their eggs

5152.5 --> 5158.38
so it's like wow almost gives me the

5155.38 --> 5161.32
feeling of a fractal and a fractal like

5158.38 --> 5163.3
I just find it pretty amazing

5161.32 --> 5165.04
how it's been designed and there's just

5163.3 --> 5167.320000000001
no way that it's all just a bunch of

5165.04 --> 5169.42
random [ __ ]

5167.32 --> 5171.94
splatting into each other and then like

5169.42 --> 5174.28
oh yeah oh

5171.94 --> 5177.219
suddenly something comes to life and

5174.28 --> 5180.0599999999995
then oh the survival of the fittest are

5177.219 --> 5181.719
the most efficient and then

5180.06 --> 5184.6
somehow

5181.719 --> 5187.12
[ __ ] happens changes things and it

5184.6 --> 5188.4400000000005
becomes all

5187.12 --> 5192.099999999999
certainly

5188.44 --> 5195.219
starts to like EV evolve in a cascading

5192.1 --> 5198.04
way up until everything just seems to be

5195.219 --> 5202.06
perfectly designed

5198.04 --> 5204.159
to all fit into everything else right

5202.06 --> 5207.96
yeah

5204.159 --> 5207.96
seems a little unlikely

5208.3 --> 5211.5
I agree Clary

5215.08 --> 5218.4
enjoy my walk

5219.82 --> 5225.219
I'm not gonna go out for a walk

5223.42 --> 5228.639
and not yet

5225.219 --> 5231.9
I still got a half an hour to go

5228.639 --> 5234.28
or unless everybody just drops off and

5231.9 --> 5236.5599999999995
stops commenting and then I'll run out

5234.28 --> 5238.54
the show

5236.56 --> 5241.179
I'm trying to find something to talk

5238.54 --> 5243.36
about here guys

5241.179 --> 5243.36
foreign

5257.1 --> 5263.1990000000005
ever reproduce

5260.679 --> 5266.6990000000005
I like to think that I will

5263.199 --> 5266.699
I hope so in a way

5268.239 --> 5271.5599999999995
I think about it a lot

5278.679 --> 5285.719
but I also know I'm not gonna let like

5282.54 --> 5288.58
desperation in any form

5285.719 --> 5291.88
forced me to do something that I will

5288.58 --> 5295.679
regret however so I'm just

5291.88 --> 5295.679
extremely careful

5297.699 --> 5302.5
and then when the time comes the right

5299.92 --> 5304.179
person will be there

5302.5 --> 5307.54
I hope

5304.179 --> 5309.84
and yeah it I'm leaving it in the hands

5307.54 --> 5309.84
of God

5319.36 --> 5325.36
what the hell are you talking about dude

5323.139 --> 5327.46
wait you're trying to hook me up or

5325.36 --> 5330.46
something

5327.46 --> 5332.94
are you trying to sell me a bride Bad

5330.46 --> 5332.94
Karma

5351.28 --> 5354.9
being proactive what

5361.9 --> 5364.799999999999
for what

5365.08 --> 5371.86
like

5367.239 --> 5374.86
I yeah dude I don't see it I don't see

5371.86 --> 5379.139
why that would be a logical thing to do

5374.86 --> 5379.139
just like totally throw everything

5379.659 --> 5385.32
around like

5382.84 --> 5385.32
dude

5386.199 --> 5393.36
perfect oh okay well that's your surest

5389.92 --> 5393.36
way to get banned [ __ ]

5405.76 --> 5411.9400000000005
being proactive well my Pro activity is

5408.76 --> 5414.1
that I'm literally just looking around

5411.94 --> 5415.54
I'm trying to see if there's anything

5414.1 --> 5418.679
out there

5415.54 --> 5418.679
that could work

5422.5 --> 5425.86
right

5423.639 --> 5429.12
in a way

5425.86 --> 5432.159
I feel there need to be more women

5429.12 --> 5435.48
naturally starting to realize the

5432.159 --> 5435.48
urgency of the situation

5435.699 --> 5441.099999999999
right like the entire world in

5438.639 --> 5443.38
Netherlands 2 is going through a giant

5441.1 --> 5446.56
life test

5443.38 --> 5449.679
and it is succeed or die

5446.56 --> 5451.42
right I need

5449.679 --> 5454.4800000000005
women

5451.42 --> 5457.719
that are worthy

5454.48 --> 5460.419999999999
to realize that before I can even

5457.719 --> 5462.58
attempt because before I can even like

5460.42 --> 5464.5
attempt to engage in some kind of

5462.58 --> 5468.219
relations you know how many questions

5464.5 --> 5470.32
they need to answer correctly

5468.219 --> 5472.6
and like I cannot

5470.32 --> 5475.719
skip that

5472.6 --> 5478.360000000001
right I don't even want to do that

5475.719 --> 5480.219
because it's all way too confronting no

5478.36 --> 5484.42
no they need

5480.219 --> 5488.26
to basically give me all the answers

5484.42 --> 5491.92
correctly without me having to ask the

5488.26 --> 5494.5
questions they need to know the urgency

5491.92 --> 5498.52
of the situation and the reality and

5494.5 --> 5501.6
answer the questions before I ask them

5498.52 --> 5501.6
and then I know

5516.4 --> 5521.199
women ask questions all the time

5519.1 --> 5523.780000000001
yeah you don't seem to understand what

5521.199 --> 5527.759999999999
I'm saying at all Bad Karma as in like

5523.78 --> 5527.759999999999
not a clue of what I just said

5532.06 --> 5537.159000000001
not talking about questions in general

5534.82 --> 5539.639
I'm talking about very specific

5537.159 --> 5539.638999999999
questions

5540.58 --> 5545.739
that that I would have to ask somebody

5542.86 --> 5549.299999999999
before I could even consider allowing

5545.739 --> 5549.299999999999
myself to fall in love with them

5553.9 --> 5558.339999999999
trust me there's plenty of attractive

5555.88 --> 5562.679
women out there it's just that most of

5558.34 --> 5562.679
them are absolutely [ __ ]

5562.719 --> 5565.92
and trapped

5566.5 --> 5572.52
it's just no way there's no way I'm not

5569.98 --> 5572.5199999999995
gonna do it

5575.98 --> 5580.54
it's like I will never accept from a

5579.4 --> 5582.879999999999
woman

5580.54 --> 5583.96
if they are gonna be like pro-feminist

5582.88 --> 5586.78
garbage

5583.96 --> 5589.679
right well good luck with that out there

5586.78 --> 5589.679
in the Netherlands

5593.32 --> 5598.5
and that's just a start

5595.9 --> 5598.5
right

5598.84 --> 5604.2390000000005
I need something that would seemingly be

5602.08 --> 5607.0599999999995
impossible

5604.239 --> 5611.138999999999
like myself

5607.06 --> 5613.179
yeah and not appearance wise I have a

5611.139 --> 5615.719
very specific range of taste in

5613.179 --> 5615.719
appearances

5618.58 --> 5623.679
I appreciate women in general I find a

5621.52 --> 5626.620000000001
lot of women attractive in one way or

5623.679 --> 5629.02
another it's just that's not enough

5626.62 --> 5631.42
just because because I don't [ __ ] around

5629.02 --> 5634.0
I don't see it as like oh yeah we're

5631.42 --> 5637.26
allowed to just [ __ ] around no

5634.0 --> 5637.26
I've had my time with that

5637.48 --> 5643.659
took my penalties from that the damage

5641.38 --> 5645.78
it does to you whether you realize it or

5643.659 --> 5645.78
not

5646.54 --> 5650.139
and I'm looking for the mother of my

5648.88 --> 5653.8
children

5650.139 --> 5656.5
that's not so easily found

5653.8 --> 5658.3
and they have to give me the answers to

5656.5 --> 5662.26
the questions that I

5658.3 --> 5665.56
would not need to ask

5662.26 --> 5669.159000000001
that no that sounds really weird

5665.56 --> 5671.1990000000005
I want them to know that that I need to

5669.159 --> 5673.48
ask those questions and I want them to

5671.199 --> 5677.0199999999995
answer it before I ask them

5673.48 --> 5680.32
they just have to really really get it

5677.02 --> 5683.38
and I'm not gonna sell for less I'm not

5680.32 --> 5685.42
gonna have somebody who's at the flick

5683.38 --> 5688.119
of a switch or at certain pressure is

5685.42 --> 5690.04
gonna turn into a [ __ ] demon in the

5688.119 --> 5693.719
face of how out of control this world is

5690.04 --> 5693.719
it's not gonna be acceptable

5694.96 --> 5699.04
and they're gonna have to be able to

5697.719 --> 5701.199
attain

5699.04 --> 5703.98
that level

5701.199 --> 5703.98
a lot

5713.199 --> 5718.178999999999
yeah ignorance is bliss for most people

5715.36 --> 5721.659
yeah and it leads to their deaths

5718.179 --> 5724.6
yeah because ignorance might be Bliss

5721.659 --> 5727.719
it's always comes with a price

5724.6 --> 5732.34
and that price is death

5727.719 --> 5732.34
yeah especially now unacceptable

5749.8 --> 5754.2390000000005
and with death I don't mean literally

5751.96 --> 5757.9
the

5754.239 --> 5760.138999999999
the eventual death the physical dying it

5757.9 --> 5763.599999999999
means that

5760.139 --> 5764.56
ignorance takes it kills you in other

5763.6 --> 5767.139
ways

5764.56 --> 5771.34
it takes away

5767.139 --> 5776.6990000000005
the ability to grow into it

5771.34 --> 5776.6990000000005
yeah if you ignore you lose

5798.1 --> 5802.2390000000005
I don't even know what that means Bad

5800.26 --> 5805.119000000001
Karma

5802.239 --> 5808.178999999999
but I I don't need any freaking tips Bad

5805.119 --> 5812.259999999999
Karma you understand

5808.179 --> 5816.179
I don't need help okay I don't need help

5812.26 --> 5816.179
finding the right woman like that

5817.36 --> 5823.599999999999
like I know how this works I'm not like

5819.52 --> 5825.88
oh no I'm 41. I don't know how to find a

5823.6 --> 5829.900000000001
yeah yeah dude I've had a lot of

5825.88 --> 5833.88
relationships right I lived with the

5829.9 --> 5833.879999999999
freaking gorgeous model

5834.4 --> 5840.339999999999
who was extremely smart in ways in ways

5838.3 --> 5842.02
not all of them smarter than me and I

5840.34 --> 5844.2390000000005
lived with her for three years yeah yeah

5842.02 --> 5849.42
now I I know

5844.239 --> 5849.419999999999
how how these things work right

5866.38 --> 5870.52
okay well

5868.0 --> 5873.719
then you can just stop blabbering on

5870.52 --> 5873.719
about it yeah

5881.98 --> 5887.86
I mean when I need some help

5884.86 --> 5890.08
concerning women or whatever or when I

5887.86 --> 5891.94
feel like uncertain about myself what

5890.08 --> 5894.88
and Etc

5891.94 --> 5898.36
I'll ask somebody whether that's on a

5894.88 --> 5899.1990000000005
live show or in a personal chat I'll ask

5898.36 --> 5902.38
them

5899.199 --> 5903.759999999999
right you people out there you don't

5902.38 --> 5906.58
need to come

5903.76 --> 5910.619000000001
with advice for me on that

5906.58 --> 5910.619
I find that a little insulting

5940.54 --> 5945.639
if I ever thought about having a dude

5942.159 --> 5948.46
I've been thinking about that a lot and

5945.639 --> 5950.679
I really do

5948.46 --> 5953.9800000000005
but this world does make me nervous

5950.679 --> 5957.04
because of the messed up things

5953.98 --> 5959.919999999999
that I experienced as I grew up and that

5957.04 --> 5962.26
kind of a nurse me in ways and that's

5959.92 --> 5966.34
also part of the reason why I need a

5962.26 --> 5970.06
woman that's going to be absolutely not

5966.34 --> 5971.679
my mother in every way

5970.06 --> 5975.580000000001
because my mother

5971.679 --> 5977.38
was ignorant in many ways and she let

5975.58 --> 5979.739
things happen because she didn't

5977.38 --> 5979.7390000000005
understand

5980.44 --> 5984.5199999999995
I need a woman that's like

5983.44 --> 5987.159
like

5984.52 --> 5990.820000000001
just

5987.159 --> 5995.259999999999
yeah that just knows [ __ ] ahead of time

5990.82 --> 5997.659
that time I I need need a sorceress

5995.26 --> 6000.119000000001
a good one one that's actually gonna

5997.659 --> 6002.638999999999
abide by the path of Christ

6000.119 --> 6004.799999999999
yeah a sorceress that abides by the path

6002.639 --> 6006.900000000001
of Christ yeah yeah good luck I know I

6004.8 --> 6008.52
know right it's like oh yeah I need the

6006.9 --> 6010.86
ultimate Peak

6008.52 --> 6012.42
seeming contradiction that nobody's

6010.86 --> 6014.699
understanding yeah yeah that's right

6012.42 --> 6018.2390000000005
that's what I need

6014.699 --> 6020.94
they probably do exist

6018.239 --> 6024.0599999999995
and if they did exist then it becomes

6020.94 --> 6026.94
the question do they actually want to be

6024.06 --> 6030.179
with somebody like me

6026.94 --> 6032.339999999999
or do they see me as the grappler that's

6030.179 --> 6035.159
after them or something I don't know man

6032.34 --> 6037.08
I hope not

6035.159 --> 6038.4
like a witch

6037.08 --> 6039.36
well if that's what you're gonna call

6038.4 --> 6040.619
them

6039.36 --> 6043.92
sure

6040.619 --> 6046.38
but if they have like real evil

6043.92 --> 6048.9
tendencies that they don't let go of

6046.38 --> 6050.6990000000005
then they can [ __ ] off I've seen enough

6048.9 --> 6052.86
of that already

6050.699 --> 6056.78
yeah

6052.86 --> 6056.78
they're not gonna [ __ ] to Satan

6057.3 --> 6064.92
like absolutely not under penalty of

6061.199 --> 6066.119
immediate breakup immediate

6064.92 --> 6069.2390000000005
right

6066.119 --> 6072.839999999999
they can't even have the impulse to do

6069.239 --> 6076.459999999999
that that's unacceptable to me right so

6072.84 --> 6076.46
good luck with finding that I know

6084.239 --> 6088.44
all right so yeah yeah my standards

6086.52 --> 6090.540000000001
might be a little unreasonable that's

6088.44 --> 6092.5199999999995
what they are right now in the face of

6090.54 --> 6095.219
everything how it works right now and

6092.52 --> 6097.679
maybe that'll change maybe I will settle

6095.219 --> 6098.76
down like seriously settle down at some

6097.679 --> 6102.96
point

6098.76 --> 6105.2390000000005
which also means let go of these of this

6102.96 --> 6109.08
gamma Hive [ __ ]

6105.239 --> 6111.54
that keeps trying to troll me

6109.08 --> 6114.48
and step away from all of this and just

6111.54 --> 6117.54
do something completely different get

6114.48 --> 6120.599999999999
away from all this influence and then

6117.54 --> 6123.179
the entire spectrum of what I need and

6120.6 --> 6125.58
what I can handle out there with a woman

6123.179 --> 6129.119
that I'm gonna marry and get kids with

6125.58 --> 6130.86
is going to change probably also

6129.119 --> 6133.92
all of that is all based on energy

6130.86 --> 6136.32
dynamics of current situation my current

6133.92 --> 6139.86
situation I need something absolutely

6136.32 --> 6144.179
pure because I'm literally struggling

6139.86 --> 6147.36
around in Bee nests and wasp nests on a

6144.179 --> 6150.92
daily basis psychologically with very

6147.36 --> 6154.5
[ __ ] up people obsessing over me

6150.92 --> 6157.02
corruption is unacceptable on every

6154.5 --> 6161.78
level to me now

6157.02 --> 6161.780000000001
every level I am Inquisitor

6162.36 --> 6165.5
I'm a paladin

6167.46 --> 6171.06
Inquisitor Style

6169.56 --> 6173.900000000001
that's what I do

6171.06 --> 6173.900000000001
so yeah

6176.52 --> 6180.860000000001
there might be some out there who knows

6189.659 --> 6195.0599999999995
my world view is quite worrisome yeah

6192.78 --> 6199.619
well it is what it is

6195.06 --> 6200.46
I have no time for loose [ __ ] and

6199.619 --> 6203.04
women

6200.46 --> 6205.8
that think that they can just freaking

6203.04 --> 6209.04
do whatever the [ __ ] they want at any

6205.8 --> 6211.46
time they think about it yeah it's not

6209.04 --> 6211.46
gonna happen

6212.76 --> 6219.3
and if there are no women left like that

6216.78 --> 6222.48
at all over here if they're all just

6219.3 --> 6225.06
completely hollowed out [ __ ] over by

6222.48 --> 6228.0
Satan and they don't even know it

6225.06 --> 6229.679
then I'll freaking get my bride

6228.0 --> 6232.98
somewhere else man

6229.679 --> 6237.32
like anywhere anywhere where they have

6232.98 --> 6237.32
some sensibility left I don't care

6241.26 --> 6245.659000000001
no I cannot be a little bit more

6243.3 --> 6245.659000000001
specific

6247.56 --> 6253.52
what's tomorrow's topic I don't know yet

6249.9 --> 6253.5199999999995
Adam making I have no idea

6275.4 --> 6280.4
for something attention grabby I

6277.98 --> 6280.4
what

6284.76 --> 6292.619000000001
what are you talking about Matthew Hall

6288.3 --> 6294.42
you just lost me okay tag myself with

6292.619 --> 6297.44
labels

6294.42 --> 6297.4400000000005
what labels

6299.219 --> 6306.42
no no Matthew Hall it's called taking

6302.88 --> 6306.42
yourself seriously

6306.6 --> 6313.1990000000005
not to be virtue signaling or trying to

6311.159 --> 6316.799999999999
build an impression of taking things

6313.199 --> 6320.04
seriously it's actually really taking

6316.8 --> 6323.159000000001
things seriously chronically

6320.04 --> 6326.94
since I was freaking born

6323.159 --> 6329.638999999999
and stop trying to stop it right because

6326.94 --> 6333.119
that happened in my life I stopped

6329.639 --> 6336.06
I thought me taking things seriously is

6333.119 --> 6339.119
bad for me it is making me unhappy so

6336.06 --> 6342.659000000001
let's just loosen it up well look at all

6339.119 --> 6344.94
the [ __ ] up get baggage I'm still

6342.659 --> 6346.32
dragging around with me because of that

6344.94 --> 6349.379999999999
yeah

6346.32 --> 6351.659
it still torches in the back of my mind

6349.38 --> 6354.1990000000005
that I actually thought that that was

6351.659 --> 6354.199
the solution

6355.38 --> 6359.219
it's none of your [ __ ] business you

6357.239 --> 6362.82
piece of [ __ ]

6359.219 --> 6365.159
stop watching porn scumbags

6362.82 --> 6367.38
huh

6365.159 --> 6371.159
why don't you stop obsessing over my

6367.38 --> 6372.84
sexual life you gay freaks

6371.159 --> 6375.839999999999
huh

6372.84 --> 6378.78
there's more to life than sex

6375.84 --> 6380.96
you disgusting perverts

6378.78 --> 6380.96
foreign

6385.58 --> 6390.0
myself as an Inquisitor and a paladin

6388.26 --> 6392.780000000001
yeah because of what that stands for

6390.0 --> 6396.659
Matthew Hall these things actually have

6392.78 --> 6399.719
exponential meanings to them

6396.659 --> 6402.239
right it's not just a randomly picked

6399.719 --> 6404.719
word I I choose these words very

6402.239 --> 6404.718999999999
carefully

6407.46 --> 6411.56
you might want to read up on the Paladin

6410.1 --> 6415.34
class

6411.56 --> 6415.34
in in my book

6415.98 --> 6419.699
although it might not be directly

6417.719 --> 6421.56
available currently online because part

6419.699 --> 6425.699
of the site is done

6421.56 --> 6427.04
but yeah the Paladin class I made I I

6425.699 --> 6432.839999999999
personally

6427.04 --> 6434.28
redesigned it in my DND rule book

6432.84 --> 6437.28
yeah

6434.28 --> 6439.679
it wasn't random nothing about it is

6437.28 --> 6443.099999999999
random

6439.679 --> 6445.679
it has some very very serious deep

6443.1 --> 6447.780000000001
esoteric implications everything that I

6445.679 --> 6452.52
designed in there

6447.78 --> 6456.84
all of it it was my freaking tarot

6452.52 --> 6459.179
project my DND book is my tarot project

6456.84 --> 6461.639
in a way

6459.179 --> 6465.7390000000005
yeah I did write a book over 10 000

6461.639 --> 6465.7390000000005
Pages d d rulebook

6467.88 --> 6475.38
for tabletop role-playing game

6471.36 --> 6478.699
character design story building

6475.38 --> 6478.6990000000005
that's what it's for

6486.719 --> 6491.639
what's it called please it's called

6488.699 --> 6493.619
troll the entire trolls and tyrants

6491.639 --> 6498.38
yeah

6493.619 --> 6498.38
I know it's absolutely visionary

6500.58 --> 6504.9
think I didn't know this [ __ ] didn't

6503.1 --> 6508.04
know what was gonna happen in the world

6504.9 --> 6508.04
yeah I did

6508.8 --> 6513.78
that's even before Flat Earth

6511.02 --> 6515.46
and he knew I knew the [ __ ] that was

6513.78 --> 6517.98
gonna happen how things were going to

6515.46 --> 6520.46
develop and I chose that name very

6517.98 --> 6520.459999999999
carefully

6521.639 --> 6525.1990000000005
but I've been writing this book

6526.58 --> 6532.639
let's see it's the last time I wrote

6529.38 --> 6532.639
anything was in 2018

6536.82 --> 6543.179
and I started it

6539.52 --> 6543.179
in 2014.

6549.6 --> 6557.76
foreign

6551.639 --> 6557.76
yeah no wait maybe even 2013

6558.179 --> 6563.28
that makes no that that's

6561.3 --> 6564.900000000001
right that's when I started to put it on

6563.28 --> 6567.659
the website yeah I started making that

6564.9 --> 6569.94
one in 2008. that's when I started to

6567.659 --> 6573.239
work on this book

6569.94 --> 6575.699
up until 2018 which is when the last

6573.239 --> 6578.218999999999
when I basically did the last few

6575.699 --> 6582.659
updates and currently

6578.219 --> 6588.4800000000005
every every single time I watch through

6582.659 --> 6591.299999999999
any of it any of it yeah 10 000 pages

6588.48 --> 6594.178999999999
is it ten thousand maybe that's

6591.3 --> 6596.360000000001
a zero too much a thousand Pages at

6594.179 --> 6596.36
least

6598.32 --> 6601.86
I don't know why I do that to myself

6599.94 --> 6605.04
right

6601.86 --> 6606.96
but yeah a lot of pages every time I

6605.04 --> 6611.159
look through something and then I

6606.96 --> 6612.96
realize there's absolutely not a detail

6611.159 --> 6615.619
about it except for maybe a couple of

6612.96 --> 6618.84
spelling errors like layout issues

6615.619 --> 6621.54
except for that there is not a thing

6618.84 --> 6624.0
that I can do to improve anything about

6621.54 --> 6626.82
it yeah the entire thing

6624.0 --> 6628.08
I literally I cannot update it any

6626.82 --> 6629.94
further

6628.08 --> 6632.5199999999995
like at best I could just make more

6629.94 --> 6634.619
lists of magical items that I

6632.52 --> 6636.06
made up

6634.619 --> 6637.98
for in the game

6636.06 --> 6639.360000000001
that could be utilized that's all that's

6637.98 --> 6642.86
like the only thing I could ever

6639.36 --> 6642.86
continue adding on to it

6644.04 --> 6647.76
yeah d

6645.48 --> 6649.919999999999
mystery that's right

6647.76 --> 6651.54
can go in all directions

6649.92 --> 6653.9400000000005
yeah

6651.54 --> 6658.58
that's the thing about DND

6653.94 --> 6658.58
you can do it in any setup huh

6658.8 --> 6663.84
you think that that all girls think

6662.52 --> 6666.780000000001
that's icky

6663.84 --> 6668.219
no no you can go in all directions with

6666.78 --> 6670.699
d and d

6668.219 --> 6670.699
yeah

6670.86 --> 6675.54
but you wouldn't know because the times

6673.26 --> 6680.099
that you played it you were just

6675.54 --> 6681.36
surrounded by stupid nerds like yourself

6680.099 --> 6685.82
yeah

6681.36 --> 6685.82
no wonder girls don't like that

6698.03 --> 6701.099999999999
[Music]

6701.159 --> 6704.48
I know Matthew Hall

6705.84 --> 6711.3
it does especially to be a good game

6708.42 --> 6714.619
master and I am I've done an adventure

6711.3 --> 6714.619000000001
for like eight years straight

6716.52 --> 6721.679
I've got it all written down

6719.159 --> 6722.699
like I was gonna turn that into a big

6721.679 --> 6724.52
book

6722.699 --> 6726.598999999999
but I haven't really gotten to it yet

6724.52 --> 6729.0
also yeah I'm kind of disappointed

6726.599 --> 6731.9400000000005
because the the group of players

6729.0 --> 6734.46
basically broke up over freaking covet

6731.94 --> 6737.58
and I'm still shocked about how

6734.46 --> 6740.36
embarrassing that it really is

6737.58 --> 6740.36
ugh

6741.78 --> 6747.5599999999995
but yeah in that group somebody from

6744.06 --> 6747.56
Sweden England

6753.3 --> 6758.6990000000005
[Music]

6754.98 --> 6761.339999999999
yeah probably the group was probably the

6758.699 --> 6764.04
most liberal possible group without them

6761.34 --> 6766.679
being overt as she AWS

6764.04 --> 6769.679
that I've could have possibly put

6766.679 --> 6772.88
together in in retrospect I don't know

6769.679 --> 6772.88
why I do that to myself

6774.719 --> 6780.84
but hey they they were pretty damn good

6778.139 --> 6783.96
and creative players they really got

6780.84 --> 6785.82
into the story and that is really the

6783.96 --> 6788.94
most important thing about the game is

6785.82 --> 6790.5199999999995
that your players can really get into it

6788.94 --> 6794.159
and also

6790.52 --> 6796.139
explore certain creative elements that

6794.159 --> 6799.0199999999995
they don't have the opportunity to test

6796.139 --> 6801.2390000000005
out in the real world right it's ex

6799.02 --> 6803.76
psychological experimental grounds

6801.239 --> 6806.78
that's what d d really is

6803.76 --> 6806.780000000001
that's what it's all about

6807.179 --> 6811.139
and then turn it into total darkness and

6810.0 --> 6813.36
Evil

6811.139 --> 6815.88
yeah some people do that I find that

6813.36 --> 6819.96
highly repulsive

6815.88 --> 6824.04
or you could get just really goofy

6819.96 --> 6827.719
like really really goofy this is all

6824.04 --> 6827.719
directions you could go in with that

6831.599 --> 6836.119000000001
and you can get all pervy too you know

6840.179 --> 6845.46
so I mean like why do you think that

6843.3 --> 6849.179
that is officially kind of typically a

6845.46 --> 6850.38
thing in the bedroom called role playing

6849.179 --> 6853.86
what

6850.38 --> 6856.32
oh so oh girls think role playing is

6853.86 --> 6859.38
Icky except for the entire category of

6856.32 --> 6861.239
people that specifically like that

6859.38 --> 6862.8
huh yeah

6861.239 --> 6865.379999999999
this is

6862.8 --> 6867.4800000000005
right so that's enough score talk from

6865.38 --> 6870.06
me about this

6867.48 --> 6873.36
ah

6870.06 --> 6876.8
sorry I I shouldn't be so responding to

6873.36 --> 6876.799999999999
trolls and chat like that

6877.44 --> 6882.9
definitely turn it into a book it is a

6879.78 --> 6883.92
book or yeah the the reports from the

6882.9 --> 6886.199
show

6883.92 --> 6888.78
well I still have the file

6886.199 --> 6891.178999999999
I just kind of have to weave it into as

6888.78 --> 6893.94
a more story format

6891.179 --> 6895.8
the problem is though it it's not

6893.94 --> 6900.799999999999
completed

6895.8 --> 6900.8
the players pretty much only got halfway

6903.599 --> 6910.139
think of Lord of the Rings and it's like

6906.599 --> 6913.7390000000005
yeah in the middle of Helms Deep that's

6910.139 --> 6916.32
now where we're at and did no further

6913.739 --> 6918.419999999999
it's kind of ironic that way yeah X20 I

6916.32 --> 6921.239
stop it I don't have it

6918.42 --> 6923.6990000000005
donate to my PayPal

6921.239 --> 6925.44
if you want me to get croissants and all

6923.699 --> 6928.379999999999
that I don't have it right now I I

6925.44 --> 6931.879999999999
already ate a peach today

6928.38 --> 6931.88
like half an hour ago

6941.52 --> 6946.4400000000005
how can you turn DND into all Darkness

6943.92 --> 6949.619
well that's very simple

6946.44 --> 6952.5599999999995
there is elaborate designs for evil

6949.619 --> 6956.219
things and evil magic and evil Carnage

6952.56 --> 6961.139
and evil creatures and demonic Realms

6956.219 --> 6964.02
and Hell literal Hells are defined in D

6961.139 --> 6966.659000000001
the war between the devils and the and

6964.02 --> 6968.88
the demons is a thing

6966.659 --> 6971.82
the Eternal War

6968.88 --> 6974.400000000001
like yeah things can get as evil as you

6971.82 --> 6976.259999999999
can possibly imagine if that's where you

6974.4 --> 6978.179
want to go with that game if everybody's

6976.26 --> 6981.26
okay with that yeah it's still gonna

6978.179 --> 6984.179
psychologically scar you though

6981.26 --> 6986.280000000001
right evil is evil whether you imagine

6984.179 --> 6988.02
it or act out on it

6986.28 --> 6989.639
it's still going to do stuff to you

6988.02 --> 6992.9400000000005
that's up to you

6989.639 --> 6995.88
to realize that and deal with that

6992.94 --> 6999.96
but you can also make it into a really

6995.88 --> 7003.7390000000005
really kid-friendly light-hearted

6999.96 --> 7007.639
fairy tale setup story DND can be

7003.739 --> 7009.799999999999
whatever you make it

7007.639 --> 7012.32
whatever you put together you can have

7009.8 --> 7014.4800000000005
all fairies all

7012.32 --> 7017.179
all leprechauns

7014.48 --> 7020.54
unicorns

7017.179 --> 7024.02
seriously you can make it all nice cool

7020.54 --> 7027.98
things big owls and [ __ ] everybody all

7024.02 --> 7029.119000000001
animals you can make it whatever you

7027.98 --> 7032.799999999999
want

7029.119 --> 7032.799999999999
and that's the power of it

7051.679 --> 7059.84
our esoteric and dark Matthew Hall

7055.34 --> 7063.6990000000005
you see that's people that's people

7059.84 --> 7068.659000000001
doing something with it and exploring

7063.699 --> 7071.119
their satanic hunger and trying to use

7068.659 --> 7075.5599999999995
their stories they make with the system

7071.119 --> 7078.5599999999995
to gravel people yeah Grabbers yeah they

7075.56 --> 7081.56
love DND a lot of them grew up with d

7078.56 --> 7084.619000000001
and d that's how they learn to scheme

7081.56 --> 7087.320000000001
uh oh oops sorry

7084.619 --> 7088.94
should have said that

7087.32 --> 7092.239
I spoiled it

7088.94 --> 7093.919999999999
I know yeah yeah but I know from

7092.239 --> 7096.94
experience

7093.92 --> 7096.9400000000005
yeah they did

7097.52 --> 7105.92
right but that's people using it

7102.38 --> 7108.86
it all depends on who is gonna pick up

7105.92 --> 7111.86
that book learn the system

7108.86 --> 7115.098999999999
think up a story and get people together

7111.86 --> 7117.44
to play in that story and that story can

7115.099 --> 7120.679
be however you want you can literally

7117.44 --> 7125.54
reenact whatever you can think of almost

7120.679 --> 7130.2390000000005
every movie type every realm type

7125.54 --> 7130.239
you could emulate within what the [ __ ]

7131.719 --> 7134.86
Crow Romance

7141.199 --> 7145.82
so but yeah of course the grappler is

7143.719 --> 7148.34
going to be with oh look at my satanic

7145.82 --> 7151.04
[ __ ] yeah that's called grappling

7148.34 --> 7153.02
that's them getting in and trying to

7151.04 --> 7154.699
ruin it that's what Grapplers do right

7153.02 --> 7156.92
and then you're people like you Matthew

7154.699 --> 7160.04
or you're like oh my God there's all

7156.92 --> 7161.96
this stupid satanic esoteric kid DND is

7160.04 --> 7163.78
evil and then you're gonna have like

7161.96 --> 7166.4800000000005
groups going on TV

7163.78 --> 7169.5199999999995
dragons of the devil

7166.48 --> 7172.82
Jeff Satan right there on the book Cause

7169.52 --> 7177.1990000000005
oh my God yeah yeah yeah it's all

7172.82 --> 7181.04
garbage all [ __ ] [ __ ] squirting

7177.199 --> 7183.739
from really over sensitive quick to draw

7181.04 --> 7186.139
conclusion morons

7183.739 --> 7190.699
yeah that's what that is

7186.139 --> 7194.06
quick to draw conclusion morons

7190.699 --> 7197.0599999999995
because D and D is whatever you do with

7194.06 --> 7201.1990000000005
it good and evil

7197.06 --> 7205.219
or evil you can soften up evil if you

7201.199 --> 7208.638999999999
want you can do whatever you want with

7205.219 --> 7211.159
it you can say things don't even die

7208.639 --> 7214.099
they just fall over and are knocked out

7211.159 --> 7217.879999999999
only like you can say that there's no

7214.099 --> 7220.34
blood you could say whatever you can

7217.88 --> 7222.38
think of and apply it to the game world

7220.34 --> 7226.6990000000005
that you've constructed for yourself and

7222.38 --> 7227.86
your players whatever you can agree upon

7226.699 --> 7230.36
yeah

7227.86 --> 7233.839999999999
role-playing can be for kids absolutely

7230.36 --> 7237.4
but it can also be for adults that have

7233.84 --> 7237.400000000001
a little extra time on their hands

7243.04 --> 7247.659
role-playing is hot well see there we

7245.3 --> 7247.659000000001
got one

7257.0 --> 7260.659
does my Game World thinking ever

7258.679 --> 7263.1990000000005
inspired my real worth it are you

7260.659 --> 7266.78
kidding me hell yeah

7263.199 --> 7269.178999999999
absolutely my god dude like how things

7266.78 --> 7270.32
went in the game that I was game

7269.179 --> 7272.84
mastering

7270.32 --> 7274.639
and constantly trying to set up my

7272.84 --> 7277.34
players and confront them with situate

7274.639 --> 7279.46
dude I had literally like

7277.34 --> 7282.619000000001
Freemason level

7279.46 --> 7285.5
esoteric [ __ ] happening where things in

7282.619 --> 7287.54
the game would literally start to by

7285.5 --> 7289.82
accident Echo things that were actually

7287.54 --> 7292.639
happening at the time in the world it

7289.82 --> 7296.36
was totally nuts it's like the game

7292.639 --> 7299.3
world was literally syncing up with the

7296.36 --> 7303.098999999999
real world like what

7299.3 --> 7307.159000000001
and like the dice would start resulting

7303.099 --> 7309.32
towards that and [ __ ] like

7307.159 --> 7311.119
like who throws like five natural

7309.32 --> 7313.159
twenties in a row

7311.119 --> 7316.759999999999
in the most crazy moment you could think

7313.159 --> 7319.839999999999
of like the it's weird

7316.76 --> 7319.84
and fascinating

7339.08 --> 7344.139
those games take up way too much time

7341.36 --> 7344.139
really

7344.26 --> 7350.96
gaining real well how about testing Real

7347.84 --> 7353.54
World Knowledge BBK Dave BKK Dave have

7350.96 --> 7354.679
you ever considered that that in the

7353.54 --> 7357.44
game

7354.679 --> 7359.719
you can bring up issues that kind of

7357.44 --> 7360.919999999999
bridge

7359.719 --> 7364.159
this

7360.92 --> 7366.38
the scenario Gap like how the real world

7364.159 --> 7368.48
is how the game world is that you can

7366.38 --> 7371.86
literally bump into things in the real

7368.48 --> 7375.799999999999
world and then use your game characters

7371.86 --> 7379.88
to act out something you want about it

7375.8 --> 7379.88
in the game yeah

7379.94 --> 7386.9
so it's actually a pretty useful place

7383.659 --> 7391.46
if you're Dynamic enough

7386.9 --> 7395.0
to test a real world things

7391.46 --> 7396.679
in role playing

7395.0 --> 7401.38
yeah

7396.679 --> 7401.38
I've thought about this and so have they

7401.54 --> 7407.139
right

7402.679 --> 7407.139
I mean like even the military

7407.659 --> 7413.659
say for a long time has used it

7410.78 --> 7416.48
for combat simulations which is kind of

7413.659 --> 7419.299999999999
what the original DND game system is

7416.48 --> 7421.459999999999
it's a combat simulator

7419.3 --> 7423.619000000001
it was probably designed for

7421.46 --> 7425.96
psychological training for soldiers

7423.619 --> 7427.04
originally

7425.96 --> 7428.2390000000005
yeah

7427.04 --> 7429.92
I know

7428.239 --> 7432.218999999999
it's a bit freaky when you think about

7429.92 --> 7432.219
that

7432.5 --> 7437.719
but all I'm trying to the point I'm

7434.42 --> 7440.2390000000005
trying to make is it was designed for a

7437.719 --> 7443.3
practical purpose

7440.239 --> 7445.4
it's not just all stupid playing games

7443.3 --> 7449.4800000000005
and nothing will come out of it's only a

7445.4 --> 7452.92
waste of time no oh no

7449.48 --> 7452.919999999999
that's just not true

7453.08 --> 7457.579
[Music]

7454.219 --> 7459.38
right that's a good comparison yes in

7457.579 --> 7461.36
the same way Dreams Are Meant to prepare

7459.38 --> 7464.54
us for different real life scenarios

7461.36 --> 7467.0
absolutely right on the On Target there

7464.54 --> 7468.86
Roger

7467.0 --> 7472.3
Cabin Boy

7468.86 --> 7472.299999999999
but yeah totally correct

7475.94 --> 7480.379999999999
that's War Games totally there no no

7477.86 --> 7482.78
it's not different it's just another

7480.38 --> 7485.2390000000005
practical application

7482.78 --> 7488.36
yeah it's not different it's not

7485.239 --> 7491.619
different BBK day BKK Dave it's not

7488.36 --> 7494.48
different it's the same it's practical

7491.619 --> 7495.799999999999
applications of using that virtual

7494.48 --> 7500.0599999999995
system

7495.8 --> 7503.719
to simulate real things and find real

7500.06 --> 7506.079000000001
world resolve by doing it yeah that's

7503.719 --> 7506.079
real

7506.48 --> 7512.178999999999
it can actually have psychological

7509.36 --> 7515.0199999999995
healing effects

7512.179 --> 7515.02
provably

7520.28 --> 7523.239
foreign

7524.54 --> 7528.679
it's kind of funny that this subjects

7526.639 --> 7530.599
brought up because yesterday I I think

7528.679 --> 7533.54
I'm starting to watch IT Crowd again and

7530.599 --> 7536.3
I saw yesterday that episode where they

7533.54 --> 7538.4
play D and D

7536.3 --> 7542.119000000001
and they use it

7538.4 --> 7544.159
the game master uses the situation to

7542.119 --> 7547.159
help Roy

7544.159 --> 7549.5599999999995
get over his girlfriend in a very

7547.159 --> 7552.739
emotional enactment through the game and

7549.56 --> 7554.06
that has a literal therapeutical healing

7552.739 --> 7557.0199999999995
quality

7554.06 --> 7561.619000000001
through the simulation

7557.02 --> 7564.320000000001
real world effective application

7561.619 --> 7567.739
yeah you prefer meditation well guess

7564.32 --> 7571.639
what you can have your preferences D and

7567.739 --> 7575.239
D role playing works

7571.639 --> 7578.32
it has an influence on the real world

7575.239 --> 7578.32
through the person

7578.42 --> 7583.639
just saying just because you don't think

7581.48 --> 7586.94
that doesn't mean it's not there

7583.639 --> 7588.5
palpably so proven

7586.94 --> 7589.579
proven

7588.5 --> 7592.579
right

7589.579 --> 7592.579
ah

7593.3 --> 7597.1990000000005
right but nobody's forcing you to find

7595.28 --> 7599.9
the DND group or anything right it can

7597.199 --> 7602.659
be a big hassle people that do play D

7599.9 --> 7604.94
and D know it's a pretty big hassle to

7602.659 --> 7606.5
find a good DND group because you have

7604.94 --> 7608.619
to attune

7606.5 --> 7611.48
and if they're already

7608.619 --> 7613.94
sliding if they've been like in a Groove

7611.48 --> 7616.638999999999
for years and they've nobody stopped

7613.94 --> 7618.32
them from sliding towards evil because

7616.639 --> 7620.78
that does happen

7618.32 --> 7623.84
if nobody sees it

7620.78 --> 7626.0
then they can just up the darkness level

7623.84 --> 7627.860000000001
and everybody will just go along with it

7626.0 --> 7629.599
and then yeah as a new player you might

7627.86 --> 7631.699
get in there and be like what the [ __ ]

7629.599 --> 7634.639
your guys are sick

7631.699 --> 7636.739
yeah so it can be pretty tough to find a

7634.639 --> 7638.659000000001
good DND group and by the way I'm not

7636.739 --> 7641.0
saying that everybody is always going to

7638.659 --> 7644.54
end up like that it can also get like

7641.0 --> 7646.639
too goofy this that like the game

7644.54 --> 7648.56
becomes so goofy

7646.639 --> 7649.88
and everybody's just joking around all

7648.56 --> 7651.619000000001
the time that you don't even get to

7649.88 --> 7655.400000000001
playing anymore because you just can't

7651.619 --> 7658.28
stop making jokes this was actually in

7655.4 --> 7660.259999999999
practice a bit of an issue in my DND

7658.28 --> 7662.9
group

7660.26 --> 7666.26
because there was just a lot of joking

7662.9 --> 7669.259999999999
around we had a Bard and

7666.26 --> 7671.96
like a halfling bard

7669.26 --> 7675.320000000001
and and the characters in it were kind

7671.96 --> 7677.06
of goofy and weird and oddballs and so

7675.32 --> 7678.98
there was just a lot of joking

7677.06 --> 7681.079000000001
constantly happening and then the game

7678.98 --> 7683.419999999999
would be held up for like two hours

7681.079 --> 7685.579
because we couldn't stop making jokes

7683.42 --> 7687.619
The Game Wouldn't progress because we

7685.579 --> 7689.86
couldn't stop making jokes

7687.619 --> 7693.5
foreign

7689.86 --> 7695.179
anyway I'm rounding out the show

7693.5 --> 7697.46
so

7695.179 --> 7699.7390000000005
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7697.46 --> 7702.28
liked this show it's a little bit over

7699.739 --> 7702.28
the place

7703.699 --> 7711.079
mostly about the predicted Moon Wobble

7707.84 --> 7715.0
that ends the world

7711.079 --> 7715.0
Beware of the evil Moon

7717.86 --> 7724.098999999999
and yeah the last part mostly talked

7720.8 --> 7726.320000000001
about d d and I like talking about DND

7724.099 --> 7728.78
right I wrote a freaking book about it

7726.32 --> 7732.139
it's very serious I never really

7728.78 --> 7734.36
published it in any paperback form

7732.139 --> 7738.32
but it's real

7734.36 --> 7740.78
it's a complete work I made it I put

7738.32 --> 7743.0
now I remember it's not thousands of

7740.78 --> 7746.0
it's not tens of thousands of pages it's

7743.0 --> 7747.5
tens of thousands of hours now I

7746.0 --> 7749.719
remember

7747.5 --> 7752.179
I mixed it up it's

7749.719 --> 7754.46
it's a thousand Pages tens of thousands

7752.179 --> 7757.6990000000005
of hours like most of the text that is

7754.46 --> 7762.02
in there has been Rewritten at least

7757.699 --> 7764.239
seven to 25 times

7762.02 --> 7767.360000000001
yeah

7764.239 --> 7769.638999999999
so no surprise that I can literally not

7767.36 --> 7770.839999999999
find any part of it that I can improve

7769.639 --> 7773.2390000000005
upon

7770.84 --> 7776.719
because yeah I've already done that with

7773.239 --> 7778.638999999999
some parts 25 times let's just saying

7776.719 --> 7781.04
put a lot of work in

7778.639 --> 7784.400000000001
maybe a little bit too much

7781.04 --> 7786.44
anyway if you like this show

tyrants

7829.04 --> 7834.679
things that I put the link in chat it is

7832.04 --> 7837.26
my work yeah some of the links do not

7834.679 --> 7838.88
work unfortunately the base classes

7837.26 --> 7841.9400000000005
which is really the most important thing

7838.88 --> 7843.7390000000005
of it all it doesn't work anymore and I

7841.94 --> 7845.839999999999
can't fix it unless I pay them money

7843.739 --> 7848.419999999999
they're literally keeping it broken and

7845.84 --> 7850.159000000001
unfixable to try to Blackmail me into

7848.42 --> 7853.159
paying them yeah because it's a free

7850.159 --> 7856.04
website but if you're interested contact

you the PDF because it's free

7859.52 --> 7864.4400000000005
it's free

7861.199 --> 7867.44
open license that's what I decide I

7864.44 --> 7870.619
decided to put a 10 000 hour

7867.44 --> 7873.0199999999995
work time into a project that I will

7870.619 --> 7874.88

7874.88 --> 7878.8
can use it as long as they

7878.9 --> 7883.339999999999
recognize the open license and that was

7881.3 --> 7885.76
my choice

7883.34 --> 7885.76

7914.06 --> 7917.860000000001
day there will be a flatter debates

7920.96 --> 7925.52
although I did Nathan already open the

7924.079 --> 7928.36
link

7925.52 --> 7928.360000000001
is going on

7928.639 --> 7932.38
I think he already opened the panel

7936.079 --> 7940.579
right whatever anyway the the show is

7939.079 --> 7942.199
not live yet

7940.579 --> 7945.739
but it will be

7942.199 --> 7946.94
it's probably in 45 minutes to two hours

7945.739 --> 7949.218999999999
somewhere

7946.94 --> 7951.5199999999995
so keep track of Nathan Oakley 1980

7949.219 --> 7951.52

7954.8 --> 7961.6990000000005
right

7956.78 --> 7964.889999999999
so until the next video

7961.699 --> 7996.148999999999
keep it flat

7964.89 --> 7996.149
[Music]
