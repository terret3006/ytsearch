85.2 --> 89.759
so i'm finally back

89.04 --> 92.64
it

89.759 --> 92.64
took me a while

92.72 --> 96.64
because yeah for those who were not

95.119 --> 99.92
informed yet

96.64 --> 102.159
last tuesday my computer just completely

99.92 --> 103.36
died

102.159 --> 105.36
and

103.36 --> 108.479
yeah

105.36 --> 112.159
it was quite a hassle

108.479 --> 112.159
overall because yeah

112.64 --> 117.92
any the repair guy

115.2 --> 119.43900000000001
a good one really turned out to be great

117.92 --> 121.92
actually

119.439 --> 124.32
was in the middle of the city

121.92 --> 125.92
and my pc

124.32 --> 127.75899999999999
is way

125.92 --> 130.879
way too heavy

127.759 --> 133.52
to just carry it all the way to like the

130.879 --> 135.35999999999999
city center and there's no buses going

133.52 --> 136.48000000000002
through there

135.36 --> 139.28
so

136.48 --> 141.44
yeah i had to basically

139.28 --> 142.879
get it right every single time i wanted

141.44 --> 147.2
to

142.879 --> 147.2
bring my computer there or collect it

148.64 --> 152.39999999999998
and that was a

150.08 --> 154.0
major hassle

152.4 --> 157.12
but

154.0 --> 159.76
i managed to do it so yeah what happened

157.12 --> 162.08
well my computer overall i built it

159.76 --> 163.67999999999998
myself from scratch

162.08 --> 165.76000000000002
is

163.68 --> 168.16
kind of old for a computer it's a

165.76 --> 172.39999999999998
miracle it's been doing so well for so

168.16 --> 174.07999999999998
long then again i've taken great care

172.4 --> 177.12
of it

174.08 --> 177.12
like very

177.519 --> 184.31900000000002
like i cherish my computer you could say

181.12 --> 186.56
because it yeah it was 12 years old the

184.319 --> 190.159
motherboard that's been used like on a

186.56 --> 192.8
daily basis was 12 years old

190.159 --> 194.56
and now i don't over stress my computer

192.8 --> 196.959
i haven't switched a lot of things and

194.56 --> 198.64000000000001
all that

196.959 --> 200.08
because i know that's not good for a

198.64 --> 202.95899999999997
computer

200.08 --> 205.20000000000002
but yeah it just died it just died of

202.959 --> 207.84
old age the motherboard that is and that

205.2 --> 210.23899999999998
yeah that's the main component right

207.84 --> 211.76
motherboard is that which connects all

210.239 --> 214.08
the organs

211.76 --> 215.599
and all the things within the in the

214.08 --> 218.31900000000002
actual computer

215.599 --> 220.319
and it just died of old age

218.319 --> 223.11999999999998
suddenly it just would yeah certain

220.319 --> 224.48
spots it would not the electricity was

223.12 --> 226.879
just gone

224.48 --> 229.2
it's just yeah and that's completely

226.879 --> 230.79899999999998
irreparable but i managed to get a

229.2 --> 233.2
replacement

230.799 --> 236.87900000000002
although it was quite costly

233.2 --> 240.64
because it's a well a 12 year old system

236.879 --> 242.879
so i had to get it second hand

240.64 --> 247.2
and yeah it was not cheap but then again

242.879 --> 247.2
i did get really good service for it

249.28 --> 255.36
right so yeah it's now running again

252.72 --> 258.16
replace the motherboard replace the the

255.36 --> 260.47900000000004
power system also

258.16 --> 262.40000000000003
because it had also died which is not

260.479 --> 264.639
surprising because i've been using that

262.4 --> 267.75899999999996
for a very long time too

264.639 --> 270.40000000000003
uh but yeah it was basically a matter of

267.759 --> 272.88
putting the new motherboard in the

270.4 --> 275.28
in the box i did that part myself

272.88 --> 275.28
actually

275.36 --> 280.40000000000003
and just reconnect it all put the

277.68 --> 282.88
graphics card in there and

280.4 --> 285.59999999999997
well with the bit of tinkering it's

282.88 --> 287.68
working again

285.6 --> 290.08000000000004
right but yeah i've been

287.68 --> 292.479
stressed out about this

290.08 --> 294.71999999999997
like unbelievably

292.479 --> 296.479
so i'm just really happy i'm kind of

294.72 --> 298.16
back to normal again today because

296.479 --> 299.75899999999996
yesterday

298.16 --> 301.759
was hell for me

299.759 --> 304.24
the first half of the day i had not

301.759 --> 306.32
sleep slept barely slept

304.24 --> 307.84000000000003
and just as soon as i woke up i was just

306.32 --> 310.4
sick

307.84 --> 312.63899999999995
right like how i get kind of sick from

310.4 --> 314.32
the tension sometimes or i have been in

312.639 --> 317.199
the in the

314.32 --> 319.84
preceding month

317.199 --> 322.56
from tension well imagine that except

319.84 --> 324.479
times three and then it's not just

322.56 --> 327.039
because i'm doing a show states for

324.479 --> 329.039
stage fright no it's just like my life

327.039 --> 332.32
is gone type of fear

329.039 --> 332.32
stress very bad

332.8 --> 339.12
but yeah the most of that is gone now

335.6 --> 341.68
and i've just had a walk

339.12 --> 343.44
because i got up really early today

341.68 --> 346.479
10 o'clock

343.44 --> 350.24
did all kinds of things

346.479 --> 352.71999999999997
and yeah i'm just feeling a lot better

350.24 --> 355.28000000000003
so hello

352.72 --> 356.96000000000004
yeah let me i forgot to show the weather

355.28 --> 359.28
all right the weather is actually kind

356.96 --> 361.19899999999996

359.28 --> 363.67999999999995
yeah getting

361.199 --> 365.28000000000003

363.68 --> 367.36
walk in there

365.28 --> 369.75899999999996
me yeah

367.36 --> 373.039
and i wasn't the only one

369.759 --> 376.08000000000004
like among that hour walk

373.039 --> 378.88
i must have met and said hello to like

376.08 --> 380.8
50 people or something

378.88 --> 383.6
because a lot of people are out for a

380.8 --> 386.72
walk today then again it is sunday so it

383.6 --> 386.72
shouldn't be surprising

388.319 --> 390.639
right but it's yeah it's kind of

389.52 --> 394.35999999999996
beautiful

390.639 --> 394.36

clutch

411.68 --> 417.52
yeah good to see you

414.4 --> 417.52
i'm glad to be back

419.36 --> 423.36
hopefully now

420.96 --> 425.599
like i did it's funny how this kind of

423.36 --> 428.8
worked out you know

425.599 --> 430.0
because i was kind of like teetering

428.8 --> 434.08
getting

430.0 --> 436.4
i was kind of me the person was crashing

434.08 --> 437.599
in the last month ancestral winds

436.4 --> 439.35999999999996
related

437.599 --> 441.52
and everybody was telling me like just

439.36 --> 444.8
get a break just get a break nathan was

441.52 --> 448.31899999999996
telling me like just stop doing it just

444.8 --> 450.479
stop doing the show take a break

448.319 --> 451.91900000000004
oh yeah sleeping warrior also helped me

450.479 --> 454.08
tinker

451.919 --> 456.0
last few details

454.08 --> 458.8
yesterday night thank you for that

456.0 --> 458.8
sleeping warrior

459.84 --> 465.19899999999996
people were literally asking me if i

462.0 --> 468.0
died i'm not surprised because as soon

465.199 --> 470.56
as i didn't show up well the last

468.0 --> 472.56
hangout was only half an hour and i

470.56 --> 473.36
basically hung up because i got really

472.56 --> 475.68
sick

473.36 --> 478.16
and then i just don't show up

475.68 --> 480.40000000000003
the next day and no contact but so i

478.16 --> 481.36
didn't have internet for an entire full

480.4 --> 483.52
day

481.36 --> 486.40000000000003
it's only like after that that i

483.52 --> 488.639
certainly figured out how to

486.4 --> 491.12
yeah reconnect the internet

488.639 --> 493.52
to like the laptop i got from service

491.12 --> 494.639
day because that thing kind of saved my

493.52 --> 499.28
ass

494.639 --> 499.28000000000003
even though it's slow as [ __ ]

499.599 --> 502.4
i think it's like

502.72 --> 506.879
this thing is like 20 years old or

504.4 --> 509.12
something but yeah it saved my ass

506.879 --> 511.199
because i could then still get on the

509.12 --> 512.88
internet

511.199 --> 515.44
and at least

512.88 --> 518.399
just like join chats and say like hey

515.44 --> 520.9590000000001
i'm still alive guys i'm still alive

518.399 --> 523.2
but yeah that was after 24 hours and in

520.959 --> 526.0
the meantime the trolls had already like

523.2 --> 528.6400000000001
written an entire script how i was being

526.0 --> 530.8
how i was like admitted in the hospital

528.64 --> 531.92
and dying under it

530.8 --> 532.8
under a

531.92 --> 535.68
breath

532.8 --> 537.5999999999999
breathing apparatus and all that so yeah

535.68 --> 538.4799999999999
not surprising

537.6 --> 541.0400000000001
but

538.48 --> 543.6
i'm fine i've been very stressed out but

541.04 --> 543.5999999999999
i'm fine

545.12 --> 551.2
because yeah i i didn't know if i was

547.279 --> 551.2
gonna make it back guys like

551.92 --> 555.68
i didn't know

553.44 --> 558.32
it like it could have

555.68 --> 560.64
just not worked out but it did

558.32 --> 563.7600000000001
thankfully thank god maybe literally

560.64 --> 566.48
thank god but it could have just like

563.76 --> 566.48
not worked

566.64 --> 571.279
and then i wouldn't have a computer for

569.6 --> 573.12
quite a long time

571.279 --> 574.959
i would have wouldn't have been able to

573.12 --> 577.04
do the shows

574.959 --> 579.92
so i'm just really glad that it worked

577.04 --> 583.12
out in such a relatively short time it

579.92 --> 585.68
let's really a short time for having

583.12 --> 588.72
basically a giant

585.68 --> 590.959
replacement surgery on a computer like

588.72 --> 593.36
replacing the motherboard is a big deal

590.959 --> 595.3599999999999
that's like a heart transplant

593.36 --> 598.9590000000001
okay with humans

595.36 --> 602.0790000000001
it's like the entire thing

598.959 --> 604.7199999999999
most important part

602.079 --> 606.399
and yeah that doesn't always work out

604.72 --> 609.279
because

606.399 --> 611.839
yeah sometimes certain parts just they

609.279 --> 614.32
refuse to work out with other parts even

611.839 --> 618.1600000000001
though they're supposed to be compatible

614.32 --> 620.6400000000001
right and it just worked out

618.16 --> 622.079
pretty quickly

620.64 --> 625.12
and yeah

622.079 --> 626.0
so i'm back and i'm very very glad about

625.12 --> 627.279
it

626.0 --> 632.36
however

627.279 --> 632.36
remember how i had like all this surplus

633.2 --> 636.88
money-wise well that's gone

637.839 --> 642.8800000000001
because this entire ordeal did like cost

640.16 --> 644.8
me 360 euros

642.88 --> 647.4399999999999
which is like

644.8 --> 648.88
pretty hefty price

647.44 --> 652.32
then again

648.88 --> 653.36
having my computer almost exactly as was

652.32 --> 655.519
fixed

653.36 --> 656.5600000000001
and working up and running within half a

655.519 --> 658.8
week

656.56 --> 660.88
i'd say that's almost worth it

658.8 --> 663.279
because i didn't i haven't needed to

660.88 --> 665.2
reinstall anything just a couple of

663.279 --> 668.16
drivers and that was it right and that's

665.2 --> 668.1600000000001
worth something too

671.36 --> 675.2
don't thank god length sleeping warrior

673.36 --> 676.8000000000001
now i am thanking god i'm thanking

675.2 --> 678.0
sleeping warrior too you know he did

676.8 --> 681.4399999999999
help me out

678.0 --> 684.079
like sort out the la the last details

681.44 --> 686.0
and that was good like uh it's just this

684.079 --> 689.3599999999999
thing where

686.0 --> 691.68
uh like the disc didn't have the right

689.36 --> 693.44
number and all that and was annoying and

691.68 --> 695.4399999999999
then things disconnect and he helped me

693.44 --> 696.399
out tweak it the last part that was

695.44 --> 698.8800000000001
great

696.399 --> 700.8
but i am thanking god because yeah i

698.88 --> 703.8389999999999
didn't know if my computer was gonna

700.8 --> 703.8389999999999
make it

706.48 --> 711.839
there were actually

708.64 --> 712.8
unusual circumstances in how it all got

711.839 --> 714.8800000000001
fixed

712.8 --> 716.8
because yesterday

714.88 --> 719.2
was a weird day

716.8 --> 722.8
if it hadn't

719.2 --> 725.2
gone the way it did and i'll explain

722.8 --> 727.68
then i wouldn't have had

725.2 --> 730.88
i wouldn't be doing this show today

727.68 --> 734.56
i would probably be doing the show

730.88 --> 737.6
the soonest like on tuesday

734.56 --> 739.68
because yesterday

737.6 --> 741.519
i had inst i had already installed the

739.68 --> 744.0
motherboard myself but i couldn't get it

741.519 --> 746.9590000000001
on i didn't understand why it's really

744.0 --> 749.839
like oh my god why won't it work ah

746.959 --> 752.0
so yeah i managed to get a ride

749.839 --> 754.8800000000001
from a roommate

752.0 --> 756.88
i've had a ride from all three roommates

754.88 --> 758.88
in total this is

756.88 --> 760.8
isn't that interesting but yeah i had

758.88 --> 763.12
the last ride

760.8 --> 765.76
from my roommate that unexpectedly

763.12 --> 767.92
showed up like totally out of nowhere

765.76 --> 770.3199999999999
and it was like oh my god like an angel

767.92 --> 772.4799999999999
just came by she's really sweet by the

770.32 --> 774.24
way and she yeah she did offer me the

772.48 --> 776.399
ride

774.24 --> 778.639
i went to the repair shop

776.399 --> 780.8
he figured out oh wait it's the power

778.639 --> 783.12
right you installed it almost entirely

780.8 --> 785.519
correctly just a couple of details were

783.12 --> 788.72
off but yeah perfect

785.519 --> 791.92
i was like yeah can still do it

788.72 --> 794.88
but yeah the power station was was dead

791.92 --> 796.4799999999999
so he had a replacement already and i

794.88 --> 798.959
didn't have to pay anything right i've

796.48 --> 801.12
already paid everything i basically have

798.959 --> 803.4399999999999
like another half computer now worth of

801.12 --> 807.12
parts but you could just keep it as long

803.44 --> 807.12
as mine's working i'm all happy

808.24 --> 812.32
and

809.6 --> 814.8000000000001
yeah and then i realized oh wait i'll

812.32 --> 817.7600000000001
just install it myself because i can

814.8 --> 820.399
probably do that and yeah my roommate

817.76 --> 822.8
wanted to get going because she actually

820.399 --> 826.399
had to be at work

822.8 --> 828.3199999999999
like not too much later after that so i

826.399 --> 831.76
was like okay i'll just put it in myself

828.32 --> 833.9200000000001
and just let hope it works right

831.76 --> 836.399
then i got back to the car

833.92 --> 838.56
and then it turned out like her battery

836.399 --> 839.76
of her car died

838.56 --> 841.199
right there

839.76 --> 844.639
it's like she couldn't get it started

841.199 --> 846.959
again it was like what the [ __ ] is

844.639 --> 848.32
so yeah that was kind of like

846.959 --> 851.8389999999999
bad for her

848.32 --> 854.48
but she had like the uh

851.839 --> 856.0790000000001
was it the repair

854.48 --> 858.9590000000001
and

856.079 --> 858.959
repair guard

859.279 --> 862.8
uh

860.56 --> 864.959
you know who this just this organization

862.8 --> 867.199
that repairs cars on emergency and all

864.959 --> 868.7199999999999
that it's very widely used very good

867.199 --> 869.5999999999999
service by the way

868.72 --> 872.9590000000001
and

869.6 --> 875.519
yeah they were taking like another

872.959 --> 878.399
hour at least before they could arrive

875.519 --> 879.279
so i was like oh

878.399 --> 881.44
wait

879.279 --> 884.0
in that case i can literally go back to

881.44 --> 887.6800000000001
the store and ask him to put it together

884.0 --> 889.36
because now she did have the time

887.68 --> 891.5999999999999
so he did that

889.36 --> 893.279
and it worked like and it was necessary

891.6 --> 895.0400000000001
if i had put it together i would

893.279 --> 897.12
probably still hadn't got it working

895.04 --> 899.92
because that it required a couple of

897.12 --> 901.839
more tweaks

899.92 --> 904.0
but he did that

901.839 --> 906.8800000000001
so because

904.0 --> 909.199
my roommate's car battery broke down i

906.88 --> 912.48
was able to get it fixed yesterday and

909.199 --> 914.7199999999999
that's why i'm able to do the show today

912.48 --> 914.72
right

917.12 --> 920.8
it sounds like the whole issue was the

918.959 --> 924.68
power supply no not just

920.8 --> 924.68
the power supply now

927.12 --> 932.72
now it was also definitely

929.839 --> 935.6800000000001
the the motherboard

932.72 --> 937.36
it just didn't feed

935.68 --> 938.3199999999999
although it's interesting though you

937.36 --> 940.639
know

938.32 --> 943.44
maybe i should

940.639 --> 947.6
check it with this new power supply if i

943.44 --> 947.6
could still put the old one in there

947.839 --> 952.0
because i thought it was the power

949.199 --> 953.92
supply originally but

952.0 --> 957.839
he had checked it and the motherboard

953.92 --> 960.4799999999999
did have like some serious failings

957.839 --> 963.9200000000001
right but anyway it's working

960.48 --> 963.9200000000001
it's all working fine right now

966.56 --> 974.8
but yeah i am almost entirely broke now

971.36 --> 978.32
so i am going to ask again for donations

974.8 --> 982.0
because i need it i got uh about

978.32 --> 983.9200000000001
what is it 40 euros left

982.0 --> 986.959
for the rest of the month which yeah

983.92 --> 990.88
well you all know that's not going to

986.959 --> 994.3199999999999
be enough to stay fed so i'm humbly

990.88 --> 997.4399999999999
asking everybody to yeah mustard

994.32 --> 998.5600000000001
some donations through the paypal so i

997.44 --> 1000.32
can get

998.56 --> 1002.88
through the rest of the month that would

1000.32 --> 1002.88
be great

1005.839 --> 1010.9200000000001
can you thank me again come on sleeping

1007.92 --> 1010.92
warrior

1015.199 --> 1019.68
very rare do motherboards feel excuse me

1018.0 --> 1021.199
george sanford since when are you

1019.68 --> 1023.92
supposed

1021.199 --> 1025.039
computer expert the thing was 12 years

1023.92 --> 1028.039
old

1025.039 --> 1028.039
12.

1046.64 --> 1053.4
you get it 12 12 years old that's

1050.4 --> 1053.4
old

1077.6 --> 1082.3999999999999
right well anyway george said it doesn't

1079.6 --> 1084.3999999999999
matter right mr buddin

1082.4 --> 1086.88
bought in in the last minute

1084.4 --> 1088.96
oh like you know oh we did it all wrong

1086.88 --> 1091.44
oh you know it's so well george sanford

1088.96 --> 1093.52
oh yeah on the other side of the chat

1091.44 --> 1096.799
you know everything about the situation

1093.52 --> 1098.08
right no he actually checked it if it

1096.799 --> 1100.559
was the power

1098.08 --> 1101.76
it wasn't just the power

1100.559 --> 1104.559
get it

1101.76 --> 1108.679
it wasn't just the power he checked it

1104.559 --> 1108.6789999999999
i'm gonna trust him on that

1112.559 --> 1117.36
right he had his own

1114.48 --> 1119.76
power rerouting so he

1117.36 --> 1122.1599999999999
checked the power it actually worked out

1119.76 --> 1124.16
just fine the first time he tested it

1122.16 --> 1126.3200000000002
turned out to be the motherboard

1124.16 --> 1129.679
then when i replaced it the power

1126.32 --> 1133.28
station also died

1129.679 --> 1135.44
because yeah that typically happens so

1133.28 --> 1138.559
yeah that's what it is there's nothing i

1135.44 --> 1140.559
can do about it anymore anyway

1138.559 --> 1142.96
right i still have my old motherboard by

1140.559 --> 1144.8799999999999
the way with the fan that's in there i

1142.96 --> 1146.24
kind of want to replace the

1144.88 --> 1148.0800000000002
the fan

1146.24 --> 1151.24
because this one does make a bit noise

1148.08 --> 1151.24
it's annoying

1155.76 --> 1159.84
hey jeff gassett adam price

1162.24 --> 1168.44
random explorer adam meekin

1164.96 --> 1168.44
at least g

1184.4 --> 1188.4
right so anyway the current motherboard

1186.4 --> 1191.679
that's in there

1188.4 --> 1195.919
is only four years old so i should be

1191.679 --> 1195.919
able to do for a very long time

1196.64 --> 1200.1200000000001
oh ralph rodriguez

1217.12 --> 1224.0
hey pg crew shank good to see you

1221.679 --> 1224.0
all right

1227.6 --> 1232.48
right

1229.44 --> 1232.48
so in the meantime

1232.84 --> 1237.039
yeah

1234.799 --> 1238.96
i had some interesting conversation with

1237.039 --> 1242.4
my neighbor

1238.96 --> 1243.52
or finally well paid a visit

1242.4 --> 1245.52
like we

1243.52 --> 1246.48
yeah we've been trying to plan that for

1245.52 --> 1248.4
like a

1246.48 --> 1251.44
two years or something that never came

1248.4 --> 1254.0
to it but yeah went over had to talk

1251.44 --> 1256.48
about all kinds of stuff

1254.0 --> 1259.52
including by the way flat earth

1256.48 --> 1260.32
and including christianity

1259.52 --> 1263.28
and

1260.32 --> 1265.52
yeah that was pretty intense

1263.28 --> 1267.6
he was very open to it

1265.52 --> 1270.32
and he is a christian

1267.6 --> 1273.36
apparently so i had like the whole

1270.32 --> 1274.96
confrontation with like the the dogmatic

1273.36 --> 1277.6789999999999
belief

1274.96 --> 1278.96
and i laid out like yeah what what i've

1277.679 --> 1281.2
been

1278.96 --> 1282.48
on to with a whole bunch of other people

1281.2 --> 1284.72
about how

1282.48 --> 1288.48
the history of the bible was probably in

1284.72 --> 1288.48
southern france and why

1289.6 --> 1296.1589999999999
and yeah my my own personal

1292.4 --> 1297.44
interpretation of christianity

1296.159 --> 1300.159
and

1297.44 --> 1301.679
the kind of like yeah we com we compared

1300.159 --> 1305.72
that

1301.679 --> 1305.72
it was pretty intense conversation

1332.64 --> 1335.6000000000001
because you might yeah sleep it's all

1334.559 --> 1338.3999999999999
too late

1335.6 --> 1341.1999999999998
i realize that sleeping warrior it's

1338.4 --> 1343.2800000000002
yeah there's nothing i can do about it

1341.2 --> 1344.559
this is what it is this is how it's been

1343.28 --> 1347.9189999999999
done

1344.559 --> 1349.84
in retrospect yeah it was probably not

1347.919 --> 1352.0
the smartest

1349.84 --> 1354.799
decision business-wise

1352.0 --> 1357.28
but yeah all right like oh you're gonna

1354.799 --> 1360.0
all complain to me oh you should have

1357.28 --> 1365.12
done this better are we yeah i [ __ ]

1360.0 --> 1365.12
panicked okay like lit i've been i have

1365.44 --> 1371.8400000000001
up until yesterday night i

1368.64 --> 1375.2

1375.2 --> 1380.4
that [ __ ] sick okay of it stressed

1378.24 --> 1382.32
yeah well you try and make a good

1380.4 --> 1384.88
business decision when you

1382.32 --> 1386.559
feel like that okay now can you stop

1384.88 --> 1388.4
complaining and just

1386.559 --> 1392.44
it's fixed

1388.4 --> 1392.44
i can do the show again

1931.44 --> 1936.559
uh was it yesterday yeah yesterday

1934.0 --> 1939.919
morning was a great distraction but it

1936.559 --> 1942.6399999999999
turned out to be pretty good videos too

1939.919 --> 1945.64
is it called again

1942.64 --> 1945.64
channel

1949.039 --> 1954.1589999999999
does it unveil mind

1951.6 --> 1957.6789999999999
something like that

1954.159 --> 1957.679
her mind unveiled

1957.76 --> 1963.279
yeah mind unveiled

1959.919 --> 1968.24
that's a pretty heavy videos

1963.279 --> 1968.24
and like very well constructed i thought

1969.2 --> 1973.519
and like

1970.72 --> 1977.84
he managed to or day i think it's a

1973.519 --> 1977.84
group they managed to put together

1978.72 --> 1983.84
some really detailed oversight like it

1982.08 --> 1986.6399999999999
seems like they have pretty decent

1983.84 --> 1988.399
oversight over alternative history

1986.64 --> 1991.679
what's really been happening and like

1988.399 --> 1994.2399999999998
martin luther's ideas are also partially

1991.679 --> 1998.3990000000001
in there and mudblood but it's like

1994.24 --> 1998.3990000000001
there's some really heavy videos there

1998.48 --> 2005.159
which one was the one that i was

2002.159 --> 2005.159
watching

2016.559 --> 2022.08
the tartaria explained series i think

2025.6 --> 2029.9189999999999
let me see if i

2027.76 --> 2033.84
said where's the video that i watched

2029.919 --> 2033.8400000000001
that was actually pretty old

2052.32 --> 2055.44
anyway yeah there's some

2054.159 --> 2059.359
great

2055.44 --> 2061.28
talk about giants especially

2059.359 --> 2064.639
and yeah

2061.28 --> 2066.3990000000003
i thought it was great

2064.639 --> 2068.56
so if you had not

2066.399 --> 2070.879
if you didn't know this channel yet

2068.56 --> 2075.119
definitely subscribe and dig into it

2070.879 --> 2076.56
it's very well constructed good pictures

2075.119 --> 2079.52
it's like

2076.56 --> 2079.52
the other channel

2080.399 --> 2084.1189999999997
what's it called again

2093.599 --> 2098.0
yeah but this channel doesn't make

2095.679 --> 2099.44
videos constantly

2098.0 --> 2101.04
the other one

2099.44 --> 2102.88
makes more

2101.04 --> 2105.7599999999998
videos i think

2102.88 --> 2105.76
which one was that

2111.68 --> 2115.48
let me look through skype

2134.32 --> 2138.119
it's not hardy machowski

2148.96 --> 2151.68
oh right right right

2150.48 --> 2153.92
it's uh

2151.68 --> 2153.9199999999996
yeah

2154.0 --> 2159.119
it's that series but it's not like on

2156.24 --> 2161.1189999999997
just one channel

2159.119 --> 2163.599
but it's the lh

2161.119 --> 2166.599
fe

2163.599 --> 2166.599
series

2172.16 --> 2176.16
but yeah this

2174.32 --> 2178.1600000000003
channel specifically

2176.16 --> 2179.52
or like the the one that makes these

2178.16 --> 2182.3999999999996
videos

2179.52 --> 2184.48
kind of talks a bit weird

2182.4 --> 2186.2400000000002
i did not have that issue with the

2184.48 --> 2187.839
channel i linked to earlier oh yeah i

2186.24 --> 2190.0789999999997
write the lost history of flat earth

2187.839 --> 2191.44
which is a great series

2190.079 --> 2193.52
by its own right

2191.44 --> 2196.079
but i thought that the other channel

2193.52 --> 2197.2
mind unveiled is actually also really

2196.079 --> 2199.28
good

2197.2 --> 2201.68
and doesn't have such a weird way of

2199.28 --> 2202.7200000000003
talking

2201.68 --> 2204.24
which

2202.72 --> 2207.1189999999997
the lost history of flat earth

2204.24 --> 2207.1189999999997
definitely does

2210.0 --> 2216.4
also i think that mind and field might

2212.64 --> 2218.4
not even be a flat earther necessarily

2216.4 --> 2220.88
but

2218.4 --> 2223.119
i have no problem with that at all

2220.88 --> 2225.359
i think they used like the word planet

2223.119 --> 2229.119
in there once

2225.359 --> 2231.7599999999998
they just don't address any of that

2229.119 --> 2234.56
mentioned like uh what is it

2231.76 --> 2237.28
electric universe theory

2234.56 --> 2239.2
so they might be like

2237.28 --> 2242.0
kind of neutral when it comes to flat

2239.2 --> 2244.7999999999997
earth versus globe earth and but are

2242.0 --> 2245.839
like fully diving into the history and

2244.8 --> 2247.76
all that

2245.839 --> 2250.24
and that's great

2247.76 --> 2253.2400000000002
i like this channel mind and feel i like

2250.24 --> 2253.24
it

2256.079 --> 2259.92
so yeah make sure to check that out

2260.16 --> 2263.7599999999998
it's got a lot of videos there

2266.64 --> 2273.1189999999997
already subbed ah all right

2269.44 --> 2275.839
yeah it might be that like nathan oakley

2273.119 --> 2278.079
advertised for him like a whole while

2275.839 --> 2280.7999999999997
back like oh this is a great channel

2278.079 --> 2282.4
check them out and i had been subbed to

2280.8 --> 2284.7200000000003
them i just

2282.4 --> 2286.96
didn't really check them out

2284.72 --> 2289.52
but i have been watching their videos

2286.96 --> 2293.8
and they were like really great i

2289.52 --> 2293.8
thought yeah it was very good

2306.56 --> 2312.44
virus in chuck with his own flat earth

2308.48 --> 2312.44
proof yeah yeah

2316.56 --> 2320.7999999999997
oh look what you did go make me proof

2319.119 --> 2325.0
flat earth

2320.8 --> 2325.0
yeah virus that's what happens

2337.359 --> 2345.7999999999997
started watching paul cook channel oh

2341.599 --> 2345.8
i don't know that one i think

2350.52 --> 2353.659
[Applause]

2360.96 --> 2363.96
um

2368.0 --> 2370.64
interesting

2371.119 --> 2377.839
right is also history and

2374.16 --> 2377.839
megalithic structures and

2378.16 --> 2383.1189999999997
that's pretty cool

2380.24 --> 2385.2
all right i'm gonna sub to them too

2383.119 --> 2388.0
him

2385.2 --> 2389.839
i really like those types of channels

2388.0 --> 2393.119
but still i thought that like mind

2389.839 --> 2394.839
unfilled had some seriously mind-blowing

2393.119 --> 2397.599
setups like

2394.839 --> 2399.2799999999997
presentations that compare because i've

2397.599 --> 2401.44
seen many

2399.28 --> 2403.8390000000004
yeah people youtubers that have been

2401.44 --> 2405.28
making videos about this i thought mind

2403.839 --> 2407.0789999999997
unveils

2405.28 --> 2410.1600000000003
unveiled was like

2407.079 --> 2413.8390000000004
particularly excellent

2410.16 --> 2416.0
because it went into so much detail

2413.839 --> 2418.16
like

2416.0 --> 2422.56
lost history of flat earth was mostly

2418.16 --> 2424.8799999999997
about like time scales and like how the

2422.56 --> 2426.88
how history was basically split up and

2424.88 --> 2429.44
there's confusion based on the time

2426.88 --> 2432.0
cycles that are based on the celestial

2429.44 --> 2433.76
lights themselves right that

2432.0 --> 2437.48
that's what that video series was

2433.76 --> 2437.48
focusing on a lot

2438.079 --> 2444.4
yeah mine unveiled

2439.599 --> 2444.4
they didn't do that so much as to go in

2445.119 --> 2451.44
like what tartaria was probably really

2448.56 --> 2454.0
like and like what the education level

2451.44 --> 2456.7200000000003
really was and how history

2454.0 --> 2459.28
it's something that i like to emphasize

2456.72 --> 2462.319
right when i do my thing

2459.28 --> 2464.8
that is that we're taught like in the

2462.319 --> 2468.0
past everybody was just dumber

2464.8 --> 2470.5600000000004
and we've grown smarter over the ages

2468.0 --> 2472.8
well that's just ridiculous this is

2470.56 --> 2475.92
absolutely not true it's probably

2472.8 --> 2477.76
exactly the opposite we've overall

2475.92 --> 2478.56
gone from a state of

2477.76 --> 2480.4
well

2478.56 --> 2482.48
mine unfilled almost says it literally

2480.4 --> 2483.839
like stated godhood

2482.48 --> 2487.2
like little g

2483.839 --> 2489.44
level power as in we might all be

2487.2 --> 2491.839
potentially the sons of god like

2489.44 --> 2494.2400000000002
originally but we've all just

2491.839 --> 2496.0789999999997
degenerated over and over again over the

2494.24 --> 2497.2799999999997
generations

2496.079 --> 2498.1600000000003
maybe

2497.28 --> 2499.76
like

2498.16 --> 2501.5989999999997
every

2499.76 --> 2503.44
type of generation

2501.599 --> 2505.6800000000003
of yeah of

2503.44 --> 2508.16
pre-species

2505.68 --> 2510.0
of uh yeah of human pre-species they

2508.16 --> 2512.319
were always bigger

2510.0 --> 2514.72
they were always smarter always pure and

2512.319 --> 2518.079
then they ended up creating smaller

2514.72 --> 2518.0789999999997
versions of themselves

2518.24 --> 2521.7599999999998
like through some kind of like magic

2520.72 --> 2524.7999999999997
even

2521.76 --> 2526.8
homunculus homunculi

2524.8 --> 2529.2000000000003
so they basically been creating new

2526.8 --> 2531.599
versions of themselves and then

2529.2 --> 2533.68
died out

2531.599 --> 2535.6800000000003
and the new version takes over or

2533.68 --> 2538.3999999999996
something it's kind of a mystery but

2535.68 --> 2540.0
it's a fascinating idea and i do kind of

2538.4 --> 2543.2000000000003
agree that

2540.0 --> 2546.56
well even biblical descriptions

2543.2 --> 2548.0789999999997
they were old giants like they were all

2546.56 --> 2551.52
giants

2548.079 --> 2555.28
so it's very likely that all humans or

2551.52 --> 2557.68
predecessors were all giants

2555.28 --> 2559.119
and we're gonna get smaller and smaller

2557.68 --> 2562.48
and smaller

2559.119 --> 2566.079
which by the way is also typically a

2562.48 --> 2570.0
sign of genetic degeneration

2566.079 --> 2572.079
yeah mutation also smaller smaller

2570.0 --> 2575.04
it's like a surviving

2572.079 --> 2576.5600000000004
miscarriage almost

2575.04 --> 2579.52
no that's a bit rough to say it like

2576.56 --> 2582.0789999999997
that but right i thought that the video

2579.52 --> 2585.079
was very

2582.079 --> 2585.079
informative

2594.56 --> 2598.319
we couldn't build the pyramid complex at

2596.88 --> 2601.92
giza today

2598.319 --> 2603.68
well we probably could skeptic 936

2601.92 --> 2606.56
it's just that

2603.68 --> 2607.9199999999996
they're not doing it

2606.56 --> 2609.52
right

2607.92 --> 2612.7200000000003
i've been

2609.52 --> 2613.599
draw starting to draw conclusions

2612.72 --> 2616.9599999999996
that

2613.599 --> 2619.52
all these super megalithic structures

2616.96 --> 2621.2
they have been built by your predecessor

2619.52 --> 2622.88
most of them probably

2621.2 --> 2625.68
during the giant age and that's why

2622.88 --> 2628.2400000000002
they're so huge

2625.68 --> 2631.2799999999997
but i think that the techniques to

2628.24 --> 2635.7599999999998
actually build that still exist and

2631.28 --> 2636.7200000000003
they're just not publicly being shared

2635.76 --> 2640.079
because

2636.72 --> 2643.9199999999996
everything is driven by exploitation now

2640.079 --> 2647.04
and those techniques are too efficient

2643.92 --> 2650.16
they're literally too efficient

2647.04 --> 2651.68
it's too easy

2650.16 --> 2655.359
with too

2651.68 --> 2658.72
much durability and too little industry

2655.359 --> 2660.319
even required to keep that going

2658.72 --> 2662.72
so

2660.319 --> 2665.52
they just take took away the stone

2662.72 --> 2666.8799999999997
molding stone casting techniques because

2665.52 --> 2669.04
it's like yeah

2666.88 --> 2672.56
the material you need is like one of the

2669.04 --> 2675.359
most abundant materials in the world in

2672.56 --> 2676.88
order to make that it's like the easiest

2675.359 --> 2680.4
material wise

2676.88 --> 2683.599
in the world to make that actually right

2680.4 --> 2685.359
megalithic structures giant stone things

2683.599 --> 2688.319
yeah you can make that with stone

2685.359 --> 2690.24
casting with the most abundant material

2688.319 --> 2692.0
in the world

2690.24 --> 2693.68
like water

2692.0 --> 2694.88
and certain types of limestone or

2693.68 --> 2697.1189999999997
whatever

2694.88 --> 2700.4
in that direction

2697.119 --> 2702.319
right it's so easy so cheap and it lasts

2700.4 --> 2704.2400000000002
almost forever

2702.319 --> 2705.599
and they don't want that they want

2704.24 --> 2708.56
industry

2705.599 --> 2710.8
they want us to be kept busy by industry

2708.56 --> 2714.24
to make steel

2710.8 --> 2716.0
to make plastic to make glass

2714.24 --> 2718.24
and make buildings out of that because

2716.0 --> 2721.359
those things break they degenerate they

2718.24 --> 2723.5989999999997
require the mining they require

2721.359 --> 2724.7999999999997
melting recycling right

2723.599 --> 2728.079
and

2724.8 --> 2730.2400000000002
it sucks it is distorting

2728.079 --> 2732.8
electrically distorting to have even

2730.24 --> 2734.8799999999997
metal parts like that that's like a

2732.8 --> 2737.04
metal wire frame for an entire building

2734.88 --> 2739.119
yeah it's it's sturdy

2737.04 --> 2740.88
but it's also disruptive because it's

2739.119 --> 2742.56
gonna function like an antenna

2740.88 --> 2745.599
automatically

2742.56 --> 2747.68
every metal part does that it just does

2745.599 --> 2749.3590000000004
that always

2747.68 --> 2751.2799999999997
so if you make the entire frame out of

2749.359 --> 2752.88
metal yeah it's going to be like an

2751.28 --> 2755.76
antenna

2752.88 --> 2758.2400000000002
and might not have the intent yeah the

2755.76 --> 2760.5600000000004
wanted consequences

2758.24 --> 2763.2
right unwanted consequences so they just

2760.56 --> 2766.88
keep doing that and they're like no yeah

2763.2 --> 2771.52
we can build gigantic buildings probably

2766.88 --> 2775.04
insanely quick insanely quick

2771.52 --> 2777.44
because it's so freaking easy to do

2775.04 --> 2779.68
and it's cheap

2777.44 --> 2781.76
you just have to carry like bags of

2779.68 --> 2784.24
powder

2781.76 --> 2786.3190000000004
then you just pour it in

2784.24 --> 2789.1189999999997
put to water or whatever how you do it

2786.319 --> 2791.2
exactly i don't know and just bang let

2789.119 --> 2793.76
it solidify and suddenly you got like a

2791.2 --> 2796.96
rock that can stand like

2793.76 --> 2797.92
thousands of years potentially

2796.96 --> 2799.839
right

2797.92 --> 2803.04
with no maintenance

2799.839 --> 2806.0789999999997
and they don't want that

2803.04 --> 2809.92
they don't want us to have

2806.079 --> 2809.92
that become standardized

2813.44 --> 2818.48
but the technique is there and it's even

2815.76 --> 2819.8390000000004
likely that certain types of unique

2818.48 --> 2822.48
buildings

2819.839 --> 2824.319
like for example anchor what

2822.48 --> 2825.76
been hearing these this from other

2824.319 --> 2827.68
people

2825.76 --> 2830.0
that there's weird [ __ ] going on with

2827.68 --> 2833.359
that structure like really weird it

2830.0 --> 2834.48
might actually be a giant 3d printed

2833.359 --> 2836.64
building

2834.48 --> 2839.52
that sounds crazy right

2836.64 --> 2844.5989999999997
but what if it literally is that

2839.52 --> 2844.599
a thing that they can literally print

2846.0 --> 2849.44
with the giant construction

2848.319 --> 2851.7599999999998
and a

2849.44 --> 2853.599
funnel and they just

2851.76 --> 2856.559
do the stone molding

2853.599 --> 2859.04
and they use the stone molding like a 3d

2856.559 --> 2862.1600000000003
printer they could have literally

2859.04 --> 2865.04
reprinted anchor what because it was

2862.16 --> 2867.839
supposedly in another location

2865.04 --> 2870.96
then it was lost destroyed

2867.839 --> 2874.24
and they found it again

2870.96 --> 2875.52
in another location that makes no

2874.24 --> 2879.2799999999997
sense

2875.52 --> 2882.16
whatsoever unless they could literally

2879.28 --> 2884.4
reprint the entire thing from scratch

2882.16 --> 2886.8799999999997
like with every detail

2884.4 --> 2889.04
in like a very short time

2886.88 --> 2892.48
just put up the construction you you

2889.04 --> 2895.359
basically build a giant 3d printer

2892.48 --> 2896.72
gigantic though as big as the entire

2895.359 --> 2899.04
building

2896.72 --> 2900.64
imagine angkor wat surrounded by a giant

2899.04 --> 2902.8
box

2900.64 --> 2904.4
probably steel framed and all that it's

2902.8 --> 2905.3590000000004
going to be a little bit of work to set

2904.4 --> 2908.0
that up

2905.359 --> 2910.24
but it's going to be doable very quickly

2908.0 --> 2912.64
and then they just print the building in

2910.24 --> 2912.64
layers

2913.52 --> 2919.28
and then yeah they could potentially

2916.0 --> 2920.8
build a building like that

2919.28 --> 2923.28
in

2920.8 --> 2923.28
a year

2924.4 --> 2929.2000000000003
can you imagine that a megalithic

2926.319 --> 2932.16
structure like anchor what being created

2929.2 --> 2935.68
from scratch in a year

2932.16 --> 2937.92
and nobody even knows about it

2935.68 --> 2939.5989999999997
i think it's doable i think that this

2937.92 --> 2940.88
technique has been out there i think

2939.599 --> 2943.6800000000003
that actually

2940.88 --> 2948.88
probably multiple megalithic structures

2943.68 --> 2948.8799999999997
have been 3d printed exactly like this

2949.04 --> 2957.04
and that they still have the blueprints

2953.92 --> 2960.4
for how to reprint it

2957.04 --> 2963.44
have you ever thought about that

2960.4 --> 2965.04
there might simply be blueprints on how

2963.44 --> 2966.64
to

2965.04 --> 2970.7599999999998
print

2966.64 --> 2970.7599999999998
these megalithic structures

2971.52 --> 2976.24
right so that it's not lost

2974.24 --> 2977.68
like it can't be lost even if it would

2976.24 --> 2979.7599999999998
be blown up

2977.68 --> 2981.52
everybody would be demoralized like oh

2979.76 --> 2983.119
my god this couldn't we could never

2981.52 --> 2985.68
rebuild that

2983.119 --> 2987.28
unless those that have that technology

2985.68 --> 2990.16
just decide

2987.28 --> 2992.88
okay we're just gonna make it again

2990.16 --> 2995.52
and everybody's like what

2992.88 --> 2997.52
and they just fend off a part and then

2995.52 --> 2998.64
it's just like

2997.52 --> 3000.88
poof

2998.64 --> 3001.839
curtain falls and the whole freaking

3000.88 --> 3004.6400000000003
thing

3001.839 --> 3007.359
brand new stands right there and then

3004.64 --> 3010.24
nobody understands how that's possible

3007.359 --> 3013.839
right i think that's what they do guys i

3010.24 --> 3013.839
think that is what they do

3019.04 --> 3025.68
i think megalithic megastructures can

3022.079 --> 3026.559
simply be created at an insanely rapid

3025.68 --> 3027.44
pace

3026.559 --> 3030.559
with

3027.44 --> 3032.7200000000003
absurd levels of efficiency

3030.559 --> 3034.48
and that last that

3032.72 --> 3036.24
all the tests of time i think that

3034.48 --> 3037.599
building techniques

3036.24 --> 3040.72
in that sense

3037.599 --> 3043.839
have probably been perfected to divine

3040.72 --> 3045.1189999999997
levels to levels that are unbelievable

3043.839 --> 3047.2
to us

3045.119 --> 3049.839
and that it has been around for

3047.2 --> 3052.5589999999997
thousands of years it's just there it

3049.839 --> 3055.52
might even be considered that

3052.559 --> 3057.44
as legend says the fallen angels gave us

3055.52 --> 3059.359
all this

3057.44 --> 3062.4
knowledge and technique well maybe they

3059.359 --> 3065.68
just like here's how you freaking print

3062.4 --> 3068.0
a monolithic giant building very quickly

3065.68 --> 3070.0
this is the device this is how you do it

3068.0 --> 3073.44
this is the material you need

3070.0 --> 3073.44
here are some blueprints

3076.319 --> 3080.8
i think that's actually a possibility

3081.44 --> 3084.48
and i've had

3082.72 --> 3088.8799999999997
weird hints

3084.48 --> 3088.88
of this like even 20 years back

3090.079 --> 3092.7200000000003
but yeah

3093.68 --> 3101.7599999999998
we won't be able to know until until

3098.4 --> 3104.8
one day it's like oh look oh we just

3101.76 --> 3106.96
discovered another amazing building

3104.8 --> 3108.8
oh look oh there's just this giant

3106.96 --> 3111.52
building there we've never noticed that

3108.8 --> 3116.559
alright

3111.52 --> 3119.28
you never noticed this gigantic building

3116.559 --> 3121.52
out in the open with satellites and blah

3119.28 --> 3123.6800000000003
blah blah supposedly these five planes

3121.52 --> 3124.72
flying over you never noticed that

3123.68 --> 3127.04
before

3124.72 --> 3129.359
right i think they're probably going to

3127.04 --> 3130.8
do that a couple of more times guys

3129.359 --> 3135.359
where just

3130.8 --> 3137.599
gigantic structures are just discovered

3135.359 --> 3141.119
right

3137.599 --> 3141.119
and they will be spotless

3141.44 --> 3146.2400000000002
right not like found back with giant

3144.24 --> 3148.3999999999996
trees and roots grown all over it

3146.24 --> 3149.4399999999996
because they can't just do that right

3148.4 --> 3153.2000000000003
that's

3149.44 --> 3154.96
you can't force trees to grow

3153.2 --> 3156.48
giants amounts of time like that you

3154.96 --> 3157.839
can't accelerate that that yeah that

3156.48 --> 3160.8
doesn't work

3157.839 --> 3163.2799999999997
but if it's just a flawless spotless

3160.8 --> 3166.319
gigantic building yeah they could just

3163.28 --> 3169.0400000000004
print it bang it's their

3166.319 --> 3171.68
and yeah it's like oh we just discovered

3169.04 --> 3173.7599999999998
this amazing building i don't know how

3171.68 --> 3175.359
we could have overlooked that oh you

3173.76 --> 3177.6800000000003
don't know

3175.359 --> 3177.68
ah

3179.359 --> 3183.2799999999997
yeah that's because you literally

3180.8 --> 3185.92
created it from scratch in a very short

3183.28 --> 3185.92
time span

3186.559 --> 3191.2000000000003
that's what i think

3189.359 --> 3192.64
you should donate to the paper that

3191.2 --> 3195.1189999999997
would be great

3192.64 --> 3198.64
make sure to donate to my paypal though

3195.119 --> 3198.6400000000003
not just paypal in general

3206.559 --> 3209.8390000000004
i'll be waiting eagerly

3210.72 --> 3216.0
all right star forts

3212.96 --> 3218.7200000000003
well why would there be freaking insane

3216.0 --> 3220.88
star forts everywhere

3218.72 --> 3223.52
when we don't even understand how that's

3220.88 --> 3225.76
built well maybe because it's like a 3d

3223.52 --> 3227.599
printed model it's just like yeah this

3225.76 --> 3229.44
is the most efficient design we can

3227.599 --> 3232.6400000000003
think for a fortress that we can just

3229.44 --> 3236.2000000000003
stomp out of the ground very quickly

3232.64 --> 3236.2
very very quickly

3243.44 --> 3248.48
there is one in china that is obviously

3245.76 --> 3251.0400000000004
a ziggurat but has trees grown all over

3248.48 --> 3253.2
yeah because then it's an old one when

3251.04 --> 3255.7599999999998
it's all covered up

3253.2 --> 3257.4399999999996
with tree roots and all that those are

3255.76 --> 3259.5200000000004
actual old ones

3257.44 --> 3262.559
what i'm saying carolyn a

3259.52 --> 3266.079
is i think that

3262.559 --> 3268.079
those buildings too were created

3266.079 --> 3269.119
really quickly

3268.079 --> 3271.599
like

3269.119 --> 3273.52
really insanely quickly that defies our

3271.599 --> 3276.2400000000002
imagination

3273.52 --> 3277.52
and they have been created a very long

3276.24 --> 3279.7599999999998
time ago

3277.52 --> 3282.4
and they are still

3279.76 --> 3284.88
being created

3282.4 --> 3288.2400000000002
very quickly just like ancient times

3284.88 --> 3288.2400000000002
that's my new theory

3288.319 --> 3292.48
not to really the one to come up with

3290.079 --> 3294.2400000000002
this but i am going with it i think

3292.48 --> 3296.799
that we can expect

3294.24 --> 3298.16
to still find

3296.799 --> 3299.92
new

3298.16 --> 3301.52
yeah get news of like oh we just

3299.92 --> 3304.2400000000002
discovered this

3301.52 --> 3307.92
giant monolithic building

3304.24 --> 3310.319
oh look at how the quality oh yeah

3307.92 --> 3312.88
yeah you just found it

3310.319 --> 3314.72
suddenly found it it's not like you

3312.88 --> 3317.04
already could have scanned like every

3314.72 --> 3318.8799999999997
part of the world to immediately notice

3317.04 --> 3321.599
every everything

3318.88 --> 3324.319
right no no no oh you just discovered it

3321.599 --> 3324.319
oh yeah

3331.44 --> 3336.64
i mean this government had people grow

3334.319 --> 3338.96
trees on it

3336.64 --> 3338.96
uh

3339.44 --> 3341.68
no

3341.92 --> 3345.04
no

3343.04 --> 3349.04
no trees like that don't grow that

3345.04 --> 3350.88
quickly that takes a long ass time

3349.04 --> 3353.04
like

3350.88 --> 3354.2400000000002
more than just like a hundred years or

3353.04 --> 3356.4
so

3354.24 --> 3358.0
nathan r

3356.4 --> 3358.799
that's odd

3358.0 --> 3361.119
but

3358.799 --> 3362.64
on the other hand

3361.119 --> 3366.079
they probably

3362.64 --> 3368.0
let it go bewildered right they probably

3366.079 --> 3370.2400000000002
already knew like these locations and

3368.0 --> 3372.72
they just like abandoned them and let

3370.24 --> 3374.5589999999997
the wilderness try to take over

3372.72 --> 3377.68
communist governments probably have done

3374.559 --> 3380.4
that right they ignore things because

3377.68 --> 3383.52
communist governments are always trying

3380.4 --> 3386.079
to recreate history according to their

3383.52 --> 3388.48
very limited view

3386.079 --> 3390.6400000000003
they're always erasing history they're

3388.48 --> 3391.68
always taking away

3390.64 --> 3394.0789999999997
things

3391.68 --> 3395.9199999999996
from the past so they yeah they would

3394.079 --> 3399.44
have ignored it

3395.92 --> 3401.76
they don't make people grow trees on it

3399.44 --> 3404.76
that's ridiculous that just happens by

3401.76 --> 3404.76
itself

3409.92 --> 3415.599
starforge use water for power oh really

3413.44 --> 3418.559
that's awesome so they use the same

3415.599 --> 3421.04
system like the pyramids

3418.559 --> 3422.7200000000003
they use hydroelectrics that's epic i

3421.04 --> 3424.16
didn't know that jeff gas said that's

3422.72 --> 3427.2799999999997
fascinating

3424.16 --> 3427.2799999999997
that's really interesting

3429.52 --> 3432.52
hmm

3446.079 --> 3450.559
right but yeah jeff gassett and

3448.319 --> 3452.16
everybody in chat i'm pretty certain

3450.559 --> 3454.1600000000003
that

3452.16 --> 3455.359
and by the way the channel i linked to

3454.16 --> 3458.64
earlier

3455.359 --> 3460.96
mind unfilled had a video specifically

3458.64 --> 3464.5589999999997
about this

3460.96 --> 3466.7200000000003
humanities already technological wise

3464.559 --> 3468.88
came to its maximum

3466.72 --> 3469.839
when it comes to building a long time

3468.88 --> 3471.2000000000003
ago

3469.839 --> 3474.0
it's like

3471.2 --> 3475.1189999999997
they could just do everything and they

3474.0 --> 3478.96
did

3475.119 --> 3483.44
and that's what tertaria really was

3478.96 --> 3485.839
it was a peak society where everything

3483.44 --> 3487.04
had been perfected

3485.839 --> 3489.599
right

3487.04 --> 3492.64
it's only afterward that like the micro

3489.599 --> 3494.4
electronics that we now use that's been

3492.64 --> 3496.8799999999997
kind of new

3494.4 --> 3497.76
in that form

3496.88 --> 3499.599
but

3497.76 --> 3502.2400000000002
almost everything else had been

3499.599 --> 3504.559
perfected like really building

3502.24 --> 3508.16
construction perfected

3504.559 --> 3510.0
and they just like stomped giant amazing

3508.16 --> 3511.839
structures and designs out of the ground

3510.0 --> 3512.64
everywhere they just like started making

3511.839 --> 3514.88
them

3512.64 --> 3518.0789999999997
it was all built full like they have the

3514.88 --> 3520.799
world was just built full with these

3518.079 --> 3522.96
amazing ancient buildings

3520.799 --> 3525.44
some of them are not probably even that

3522.96 --> 3528.4
ancient but they are

3525.44 --> 3530.16
crafted with ancient knowledge

3528.4 --> 3533.52
and that knowledge is still around it's

3530.16 --> 3533.52
just being kept secret now

3537.68 --> 3542.0789999999997
and then yeah

3539.839 --> 3543.599
a group of

3542.079 --> 3546.0
very dark

3543.599 --> 3549.76
conspirators basically said okay yeah

3546.0 --> 3552.079
we're going to now rob the humanity

3549.76 --> 3555.92
of its knowledge we're going to take it

3552.079 --> 3555.92
all away and make them imagine

3556.24 --> 3560.3999999999996
like nothing of that actually happened

3558.559 --> 3562.48
and that yeah then that's how they

3560.4 --> 3565.52
invented the

3562.48 --> 3568.0
historical chronology system that is

3565.52 --> 3571.7599999999998
still being taught in schools

3568.0 --> 3574.48
based on the idea of evolution

3571.76 --> 3576.3190000000004
that people they were very stupid and

3574.48 --> 3578.079
then we're getting smarter we're getting

3576.319 --> 3581.96
more advanced

3578.079 --> 3586.2400000000002
that idea when in reality it's exactly

3581.96 --> 3588.319
exactly the opposite

3586.24 --> 3590.9599999999996
the average intelligence

3588.319 --> 3593.839
humanity this age

3590.96 --> 3596.7200000000003
is less than it was a hundred years ago

3593.839 --> 3599.2
a hundred years ago it was less than a

3596.72 --> 3601.1189999999997
hundred years before that

3599.2 --> 3602.24
and before that

3601.119 --> 3606.079
was

3602.24 --> 3609.1189999999997
yeah it was they were always smarter

3606.079 --> 3611.8390000000004
smarter brighter

3609.119 --> 3614.079
less easy to be fooled healthier

3611.839 --> 3617.119
spiritually apt

3614.079 --> 3619.3590000000004
and it's only grown less

3617.119 --> 3622.079
that's why we all cherish people that

3619.359 --> 3623.7599999999998
are very bright because they are like

3622.079 --> 3625.76
like the ancients

3623.76 --> 3627.44
it's like the ancient spark that hasn't

3625.76 --> 3629.76
gone out yet because that's what

3627.44 --> 3632.2400000000002
actually happens over the generations

3629.76 --> 3634.6400000000003
everybody gets dumber

3632.24 --> 3638.319
unfortunately

3634.64 --> 3640.96
not dramatically dumber necessarily but

3638.319 --> 3644.72
slightly just a little bit less and it's

3640.96 --> 3644.7200000000003
also the influence of the world

3645.92 --> 3651.28
because society now is sick deranged and

3649.28 --> 3653.599
delusional and incomplete in its

3651.28 --> 3655.76
knowledge

3653.599 --> 3658.2400000000002
and it's getting worse and that's going

3655.76 --> 3660.7990000000004
to literally reflect upon the spirit of

3658.24 --> 3660.799
the people

3662.079 --> 3667.44
that grow up in it so the worse the

3664.319 --> 3669.2
society gets the more

3667.44 --> 3672.559
burdened

3669.2 --> 3674.5589999999997
and deranged the generations become

3672.559 --> 3676.88
and that's only a continuing it's gonna

3674.559 --> 3678.6400000000003
get worse like yeah it's gonna get worse

3676.88 --> 3681.119
can you imagine that

3678.64 --> 3684.96
remember 2010

3681.119 --> 3687.52
the sjw [ __ ] hitting the fan and all

3684.96 --> 3689.44
that can you imagine that in

3687.52 --> 3692.64
20 years

3689.44 --> 3694.4
something much worse this is

3692.64 --> 3698.52
i don't want to imagine but it's

3694.4 --> 3698.52
probably gonna happen anyway

3701.119 --> 3706.2400000000002
because yeah there's nothing really

3703.04 --> 3709.04
stopping the the decay the degeneration

3706.24 --> 3709.04
of society

3709.2 --> 3714.5589999999997
the other thing that could do that is a

3711.92 --> 3716.88
giant slaughter

3714.559 --> 3719.44
and there's no way that's gonna happen

3716.88 --> 3722.96
in that sense it's like no they'll just

3719.44 --> 3722.96
slay everybody's mind

3724.079 --> 3728.0
right because it's the devil's in

3726.319 --> 3729.359
control it's the devil's in control

3728.0 --> 3731.68
through

3729.359 --> 3734.48
cabals through

3731.68 --> 3736.96
psychopaths through business

3734.48 --> 3738.319
and they're not gonna let go and it's

3736.96 --> 3740.64
like the people

3738.319 --> 3743.119
can't do without them anymore we've

3740.64 --> 3745.1189999999997
already been enslaved to the devils that

3743.119 --> 3747.2000000000003
are in control

3745.119 --> 3748.559
through business through secret families

3747.2 --> 3751.1189999999997
and all that

3748.559 --> 3754.6400000000003
and that's never gonna go away again

3751.119 --> 3756.319
unless they are all slaughtered in one

3754.64 --> 3759.359
fell swoop

3756.319 --> 3763.119
and i mean slaughtered

3759.359 --> 3766.24
no way out they all die if every seed of

3763.119 --> 3767.119
that spirit dies

3766.24 --> 3770.4799999999996
then

3767.119 --> 3772.88
perhaps everybody can just

3770.48 --> 3775.2
snap out of it collectively because

3772.88 --> 3777.599
there is no more devil influence through

3775.2 --> 3779.4399999999996
those systems through those people

3777.599 --> 3782.2400000000002
through

3779.44 --> 3784.799
through their dark arts

3782.24 --> 3786.8799999999997
and then potentially the degeneration

3784.799 --> 3789.599
cycle could be halted

3786.88 --> 3792.0
can it be reversed i don't know if

3789.599 --> 3793.6800000000003
that's even possible

3792.0 --> 3796.0
but it might

3793.68 --> 3800.24
but what requires

3796.0 --> 3803.28
yeah what is required for that is that

3800.24 --> 3805.0389999999998
the ones that have been just demolishing

3803.28 --> 3807.6800000000003
the psychology

3805.039 --> 3810.2400000000002
in society

3807.68 --> 3812.16
for several generations based on a very

3810.24 --> 3814.24
systematic

3812.16 --> 3816.24
set of principles on how to do that and

3814.24 --> 3817.52
stick to that and sacrifice everything

3816.24 --> 3820.319
to that

3817.52 --> 3822.0
those people need to be eradicated

3820.319 --> 3824.72
completely and like

3822.0 --> 3827.599
everything they figured out on how to do

3824.72 --> 3830.319
what they do needs to be erased

3827.599 --> 3831.599
like erased erased

3830.319 --> 3834.799
as in

3831.599 --> 3837.52
scan every piece of data everywhere in

3834.799 --> 3839.119
the world and erase it

3837.52 --> 3841.44
the information

3839.119 --> 3842.96
what they have done what they are doing

3841.44 --> 3845.2000000000003
and how they are doing it needs to be

3842.96 --> 3846.319
erased completely

3845.2 --> 3850.3999999999996
so that

3846.319 --> 3853.2
it cannot snap onto a new person

3850.4 --> 3855.359
that will be like i get this i'm gonna

3853.2 --> 3858.0789999999997
do this i'm gonna take control it needs

3855.359 --> 3860.319
to be erased forever people that do that

3858.079 --> 3861.8390000000004
need to be erased and the information

3860.319 --> 3863.599
that does it

3861.839 --> 3866.64
needs to be erased

3863.599 --> 3868.96
and that's the only way to halt it

3866.64 --> 3870.48
it's the only way

3868.96 --> 3873.359
because

3870.48 --> 3875.359
as long as it isn't halted as if they

3873.359 --> 3878.4
are continuing

3875.359 --> 3881.119
everybody will beg for their own

3878.4 --> 3884.1600000000003
slaughter and torture

3881.119 --> 3888.559
forever generation upon generation get

3884.16 --> 3891.2
worsening begging for their own slaying

3888.559 --> 3894.6800000000003
they will not stop it the degeneration

3891.2 --> 3894.68
will not stop

3896.079 --> 3901.6800000000003
right and we're integrated you can't

3898.72 --> 3903.7599999999998
escape it we use computers

3901.68 --> 3906.64
we couldn't even know

3903.76 --> 3909.3590000000004
about each other's existence if we

3906.64 --> 3913.1189999999997
didn't

3909.359 --> 3916.16
integrate in some way with those people

3913.119 --> 3919.039
that caused the degeneration cycle there

3916.16 --> 3922.0789999999997
is no more technology left that doesn't

3919.039 --> 3923.8390000000004
apply it in some director or indirect

3922.079 --> 3925.76
way

3923.839 --> 3927.92
right it's like

3925.76 --> 3930.7990000000004
effectively you could argue that the

3927.92 --> 3932.079
amish are the only group of people in

3930.799 --> 3935.119
the world

3932.079 --> 3938.88
that are completely escaping it

3935.119 --> 3938.88
the only ones that i know

3939.359 --> 3944.0789999999997
because everything else every

3941.44 --> 3946.319
development every everything we do me

3944.079 --> 3949.599
and my computer it's all tied in there

3946.319 --> 3950.799
and there's no escape there's no escape

3949.599 --> 3952.319
unless

3950.799 --> 3954.72
all the powers

3952.319 --> 3957.52
of the people that do that the devils if

3954.72 --> 3960.8799999999997
they're all eradicated

3957.52 --> 3964.4
no exception like mandated like

3960.88 --> 3966.4
this is illegal

3964.4 --> 3969.76
punishable by death

3966.4 --> 3972.079
worldwide no escape nowhere

3969.76 --> 3974.079
you know you go to mars or something

3972.079 --> 3976.7200000000003
like go in a rock and splatter against

3974.079 --> 3979.28
the firmament good just [ __ ] off one way

3976.72 --> 3980.3999999999996
or the other as long as that doesn't

3979.28 --> 3982.0
happen

3980.4 --> 3983.76
it's all gonna degenerate and we're

3982.0 --> 3985.76
gonna get worse and worse over the

3983.76 --> 3988.2400000000002
generations and we're gonna feel like

3985.76 --> 3990.4
yeah but i got through this

3988.24 --> 3992.9599999999996
my generation and my kids will get

3990.4 --> 3995.599
through this too yeah but they will be

3992.96 --> 3997.839
more degenerated

3995.599 --> 4001.52
there's no escape

3997.839 --> 4003.359
no escape except

4001.52 --> 4005.68
devil

4003.359 --> 4008.24
extermination

4005.68 --> 4010.3999999999996
and everybody that has power everybody

4008.24 --> 4013.839
that pretends to

4010.4 --> 4017.96
be there to do that are all it

4013.839 --> 4017.96
all of them no exception

4021.039 --> 4026.2400000000002
there's no exception

4022.799 --> 4026.96
everybody that claims or is designated

4026.24 --> 4029.7599999999998
to

4026.96 --> 4032.7200000000003
hunt down evil and to eradicate it they

4029.76 --> 4036.1600000000003
are the evil all of them

4032.72 --> 4036.16
some of them don't even know it

4037.599 --> 4041.52
it's all the same system it's like

4039.119 --> 4043.76
there's nothing left of the old

4041.52 --> 4045.68
like that it would have to be

4043.76 --> 4048.7990000000004
sprung up out of nothing in the

4045.68 --> 4053.359
stillness to get that back because as

4048.799 --> 4054.88
long as this devil spiritual structure

4053.359 --> 4055.7599999999998
persists

4054.88 --> 4058.799
that

4055.76 --> 4061.28
ancient light that purity cannot return

4058.799 --> 4063.92
it cannot return because there is

4061.28 --> 4066.7200000000003
nothing for it to latch onto everything

4063.92 --> 4069.039
we know is integrated in the devil

4066.72 --> 4070.64
structures everything we know

4069.039 --> 4073.6800000000003
everything

4070.64 --> 4076.4
information history

4073.68 --> 4077.5989999999997
technology everything

4076.4 --> 4082.039
we know

4077.599 --> 4082.039
is integrated into that system

4092.319 --> 4097.92
it's the v like a receiver yeah no [ __ ]

4095.359 --> 4099.44
of course it is

4097.92 --> 4102.92
a lot of stopping traffic in my roster

4099.44 --> 4102.919999999999
hat by the way

4108.56 --> 4111.56
so

4128.719 --> 4131.44
right so

4131.6 --> 4136.0
yeah

4132.48 --> 4138.4
it's pretty grim isn't it my prediction

4136.0 --> 4140.88
feeding back again to we have to slay

4138.4 --> 4143.04
them all yeah it's it sounds i feel like

4140.88 --> 4146.0
an idiot every time i say that

4143.04 --> 4148.4
problem is though i'm [ __ ] right

4146.0 --> 4150.4
about it and there's nothing that

4148.4 --> 4152.159
anybody

4150.4 --> 4155.199
can do about it

4152.159 --> 4157.759
right you just learn to carry on just

4155.199 --> 4159.839
peaceful demonstration oh this yeah

4157.759 --> 4161.839
guess what it's all going to get worse

4159.839 --> 4163.679
and worse and worse over the generations

4161.839 --> 4167.359
you don't have to worry about it though

4163.679 --> 4168.319
you'll be dead by the time

4167.359 --> 4170.799
right

4168.319 --> 4173.1990000000005
just like our elders now they're staring

4170.799 --> 4175.6
at the world they're looking at holy

4173.199 --> 4178.08
[ __ ] is everybody [ __ ] [ __ ] we

4175.6 --> 4179.6
can't even explain to them how [ __ ]

4178.08 --> 4180.96
they are now

4179.6 --> 4183.6
toe olds

4180.96 --> 4185.839
i can't handle this anymore yeah it's

4183.6 --> 4187.839
gonna happen to you too you think people

4185.839 --> 4190.0
are stupid right now

4187.839 --> 4193.2789999999995
wait if you even survive that long wait

4190.0 --> 4196.32
until you're like really old

4193.279 --> 4198.400000000001
and and take a look again oh you think

4196.32 --> 4201.12
that everything's gonna be all right no

4198.4 --> 4204.0
it's not it's gonna get worse and worse

4201.12 --> 4206.8
and worse and there's no strategy in

4204.0 --> 4210.4
your personal life that you can attain

4206.8 --> 4212.56
to stop that degeneration except

4210.4 --> 4215.5199999999995
everybody in the world comes together

4212.56 --> 4216.96
and decides we are going to surgically

4215.52 --> 4220.96
remove

4216.96 --> 4222.719
this entire devil spirit

4220.96 --> 4225.36
surgically remove it

4222.719 --> 4225.36
completely

4226.4 --> 4230.639999999999
no more lies

4228.8 --> 4232.8
at all

4230.64 --> 4235.679
everything revealed

4232.8 --> 4238.8
all industry [ __ ] industry [ __ ] all

4235.679 --> 4239.76
money [ __ ] all industry

4238.8 --> 4241.84
right

4239.76 --> 4243.76
the systems for it of course there needs

4241.84 --> 4245.12
to be production there needs to be food

4243.76 --> 4245.84
all that

4245.12 --> 4247.92
but

4245.84 --> 4248.88
industry economy

4247.92 --> 4252.32
power

4248.88 --> 4253.84
broking all that it needs to go

4252.32 --> 4257.28
and nothing

4253.84 --> 4259.6
to replace it nothing like avoid avoid

4257.28 --> 4263.5199999999995
forever and if anybody tries to fill

4259.6 --> 4265.1990000000005
that void instant death penalty

4263.52 --> 4268.88
instant death

4265.199 --> 4273.239
no more returning of that ever

4268.88 --> 4273.2390000000005
there's no power group

4273.76 --> 4281.76
no power groups nobody taking control

4278.48 --> 4283.678999999999
all gone and gone forever no more return

4281.76 --> 4287.280000000001
of that that's the only way that's gonna

4283.679 --> 4289.92
stop it potentially in my view

4287.28 --> 4292.159
but it's it's yeah isn't it just like

4289.92 --> 4293.6
overkill scale like how is this going to

4292.159 --> 4296.08
be managed

4293.6 --> 4299.04
the only way this could be managed

4296.08 --> 4301.84
is if there was a giant world war

4299.04 --> 4303.92
that would not be a fake world war like

4301.84 --> 4306.159000000001
every world war before this where it's

4303.92 --> 4308.159
always just business

4306.159 --> 4310.0
funding one side funding the other no in

4308.159 --> 4314.32
this case it would be a war that would

4310.0 --> 4316.8
literally destroy all funders

4314.32 --> 4318.639999999999
where it's like all gone all everything

4316.8 --> 4321.679
it's all destroyed

4318.64 --> 4324.2390000000005
it's like nobody left none of these

4321.679 --> 4326.4
power people would be left they would be

4324.239 --> 4328.718999999999
all gone

4326.4 --> 4331.679
like not a single one not a single

4328.719 --> 4334.64
surviving group of power

4331.679 --> 4339.0
must be left and if that happens yeah

4334.64 --> 4339.0
then we might have a chance

4349.28 --> 4353.96
the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

4357.36 --> 4361.599999999999
no it wouldn't

4359.6 --> 4363.84
donate to my paypal

4361.6 --> 4366.320000000001
or [ __ ] off

4363.84 --> 4370.88
i'm not taking any deals i'm definitely

4366.32 --> 4374.08
not gonna go to some freaking hotel

4370.88 --> 4377.84
i need money support i don't need

4374.08 --> 4382.36
a life replacement plan from some

4377.84 --> 4382.360000000001
freaking stranger thanks

4390.239 --> 4396.159
to fight these bad people oh yeah sure

4393.6 --> 4398.64
fight these bad people

4396.159 --> 4401.199
yeah money is going to do that now money

4398.64 --> 4403.6
is their tool

4401.199 --> 4407.96
and if you even think that money can

4403.6 --> 4407.96
defeat them you're delusional

4422.56 --> 4426.96
do you have a number in mind like a

4424.88 --> 4429.1990000000005
monthly income deal well

4426.96 --> 4434.08
i've reasoned out i've calculated

4429.199 --> 4435.44
earlier that i need around 300 euros

4434.08 --> 4438.0
in donation

4435.44 --> 4440.639999999999
in donations a month

4438.0 --> 4443.199
to basically keep going and without

4440.64 --> 4443.1990000000005
crashing

4447.6 --> 4452.64
yeah so send me the money but it's it's

4449.92 --> 4454.8
going to be unconditional though

4452.64 --> 4457.1990000000005
if yeah there is no condition you're

4454.8 --> 4459.84
going to tie in with sending me money

4457.199 --> 4462.5599999999995
and that's a fact

4459.84 --> 4464.4800000000005
except if you want a shout out to a name

4462.56 --> 4466.8
or a channel and that's it

4464.48 --> 4468.959999999999
that's the only thing is only a one-time

4466.8 --> 4472.159000000001
deal

4468.96 --> 4474.4800000000005
for every time you donate

4472.159 --> 4478.4
and if you're gonna send me like a euro

4474.48 --> 4478.4
every day that that doesn't count

4481.28 --> 4485.12
that sounds more than doable

4484.0 --> 4487.6
that

4485.12 --> 4491.199
okay

4487.6 --> 4493.04
all right at smack sure

4491.199 --> 4494.4
dude if you want to be a sponsor that

4493.04 --> 4497.719
would be great

4494.4 --> 4497.719
i'll accept

4507.76 --> 4511.84
i can always use more people yeah more

4510.0 --> 4513.28
donations so

4511.84 --> 4515.6
if you're serious about this you're not

4513.28 --> 4518.32
trying to trick me

4515.6 --> 4519.92
like mark smiley and all that

4518.32 --> 4523.159
then i'm all good

4519.92 --> 4523.159
i accept

4555.36 --> 4558.92
right anyway

4565.6 --> 4568.649
[Music]

4569.76 --> 4574.64
right yeah jeff gas had earlier hello

4572.08 --> 4576.719
bex by the way good to see you

4574.64 --> 4579.6
said we live in the satanic realm if

4576.719 --> 4581.52
only everyone knew it we could stop it

4579.6 --> 4583.280000000001
yeah unfortunately that's not how it

4581.52 --> 4585.4400000000005
works

4583.28 --> 4587.44
because

4585.44 --> 4589.04
you know what most people do when they

4587.44 --> 4592.5599999999995
figure it out

4589.04 --> 4594.8
they immediately take the side

4592.56 --> 4597.280000000001
of the power and they're like oh well if

4594.8 --> 4600.08
we're in a satanic realm then i'm going

4597.28 --> 4602.239
to just use that and be part of that

4600.08 --> 4603.679
that's what most people tend to do

4602.239 --> 4606.159
because it's

4603.679 --> 4608.719
overwhelming

4606.159 --> 4612.08
once you realize how overwhelming the

4608.719 --> 4614.32
power is how systematic it is

4612.08 --> 4616.96
most people don't choose to basically

4614.32 --> 4619.92
take on a giant burden

4616.96 --> 4622.56
in the moment where they don't even

4619.92 --> 4624.0
they basically are guaranteed to not

4622.56 --> 4626.159000000001
even have

4624.0 --> 4627.92
any sort of successful life coming out

4626.159 --> 4630.719
of that

4627.92 --> 4633.28
yeah most people choose not to do that

4630.719 --> 4635.04
they either forget about it or they are

4633.28 --> 4637.5199999999995
just like oh i'll just be part of the

4635.04 --> 4640.159
beast system that's what most people do

4637.52 --> 4642.159000000001
unfortunately

4640.159 --> 4644.639999999999
in these conditions

4642.159 --> 4646.239
right because it's already so bad that's

4644.64 --> 4648.8
why they do it

4646.239 --> 4651.199
it's like oh that's the trick to

4648.8 --> 4655.04
be the devil okay i'll just do that

4651.199 --> 4655.04
that's what most people do unfortunately

4657.76 --> 4663.84
wrath where have i been all day a week

4660.4 --> 4666.0
my computer was broken wrath

4663.84 --> 4667.28
was very lucky to have it repaired as

4666.0 --> 4669.6
quickly as it

4667.28 --> 4672.239
as i did

4669.6 --> 4674.8
i will need some financial support to

4672.239 --> 4678.239
get through the rest of the month

4674.8 --> 4680.56
because yeah i was not cheap

4678.239 --> 4682.718999999999
wow on fire today thanks

4680.56 --> 4683.679
well yeah i've had a half a week break

4682.719 --> 4686.88
so

4683.679 --> 4691.08
and i got some things on my mind

4686.88 --> 4691.08
i really miss doing the show

4715.12 --> 4719.28
a little time to sharpen the blade

4716.719 --> 4721.84
indeed though it made me literally sick

4719.28 --> 4721.84
though

4724.0 --> 4728.719
like

4725.84 --> 4729.92
i had basically the circumstances had to

4728.719 --> 4732.96
force me

4729.92 --> 4734.4800000000005
to not do the show i had to be forced by

4732.96 --> 4736.0
circumstance because if my computer

4734.48 --> 4736.879999999999
hadn't broke i just wouldn't have done

4736.0 --> 4739.04
it

4736.88 --> 4741.679
i would have just continued maybe gotten

4739.04 --> 4743.04
sick again and be like a short show i

4741.679 --> 4745.52
don't feel well

4743.04 --> 4749.84
but it would not have stopped i wouldn't

4745.52 --> 4749.84
have done it i know i wouldn't

4750.08 --> 4754.48
so i've kind of been forced to not do my

4752.48 --> 4757.678999999999
shows because my computer was broken and

4754.48 --> 4761.48
i was literally sick i just had

4757.679 --> 4761.4800000000005
what do you call it uh

4766.91 --> 4770.7789999999995
[Applause]

4773.679 --> 4778.32
withdrawal symptoms

4775.76 --> 4782.6
i literally had withdrawal symptoms and

4778.32 --> 4782.599999999999
a bit of anxiety too

4792.56 --> 4797.120000000001
like that first day was absolute hell i

4794.64 --> 4799.92
was just like there sitting not being

4797.12 --> 4801.44
able to get on the internet

4799.92 --> 4803.6
realizing that

4801.44 --> 4806.159
like yeah i can't tell you guys why i

4803.6 --> 4808.719
didn't show up when my last show i was

4806.159 --> 4812.44
really sick

4808.719 --> 4812.44
it was like terrible

4818.48 --> 4824.5599999999995
it's good to have you back thanks it's

4820.639 --> 4824.56
good to be back and i feel good

4826.48 --> 4830.718999999999
i am hungry though

4828.719 --> 4832.56
i've got a lot of food catching up to do

4830.719 --> 4834.8
because i barely ate anything this half

4832.56 --> 4834.8
week

4834.96 --> 4838.96
oh but i'm gonna have some great chicken

4836.8 --> 4842.4400000000005
broccoli though this evening looking

4838.96 --> 4842.44
forward to that

4858.719 --> 4861.719
hmm

4863.04 --> 4867.6
everything seems to be working just

4864.96 --> 4867.6
smoothly

4867.76 --> 4871.76
the sound is a bit weird

4872.0 --> 4876.159
are you guys picking up like the sound

4874.239 --> 4878.638999999999
of a fan

4876.159 --> 4881.199
because it's going

4878.639 --> 4882.2390000000005
to me i don't it's kind of annoying

4881.199 --> 4884.08
really

4882.239 --> 4886.5599999999995
i don't know if you are picking any of

4884.08 --> 4886.5599999999995
that up

4886.639 --> 4892.4400000000005
put

4888.56 --> 4892.4400000000005
this should help a little

4920.88 --> 4924.639
oh it's okay cool

4922.88 --> 4926.88
all right good to hear i'll just put it

4924.639 --> 4929.04
back

4926.88 --> 4930.96
that's awesome i'm glad you're not

4929.04 --> 4935.0
picking up on that because

4930.96 --> 4935.0
yeah that would be super annoying

4948.239 --> 4954.599999999999
have you checked the night owl backdrop

4951.199 --> 4954.599999999999
what do you mean

4959.44 --> 4964.08
you mean like the rain of fire

4961.52 --> 4964.080000000001
background

4966.159 --> 4969.04
no i have not

4971.36 --> 4975.12
green volcano what

4979.04 --> 4984.239
yeah but it should be just fine

4981.679 --> 4988.639
a good buzzing oh you're hearing it

4984.239 --> 4988.638999999999
again of course you are george sanford

4991.76 --> 4997.280000000001
have you ever considered that maybe your

4994.239 --> 5001.839999999999
sound system just sucks because you're

4997.28 --> 5001.84
always complaining about the sound

5022.48 --> 5026.5599999999995
all right but enemy can yeah the uh the

5024.56 --> 5027.4400000000005
other background

5026.56 --> 5029.6
should

5027.44 --> 5031.678999999999
should just be fine because it's pretty

5029.6 --> 5034.159000000001
much the same folder

5031.679 --> 5037.159
as mountain view and that's working fine

5034.159 --> 5037.159
so

5045.92 --> 5051.639
let's check it

5048.08 --> 5051.639
yeah there you go

5066.719 --> 5069.719
ah

5076.239 --> 5079.239
um

5087.36 --> 5090.88
space dwarfs what

5092.08 --> 5097.8
it's like space mining or something that

5094.56 --> 5097.8
sounds hilarious

5105.12 --> 5109.5599999999995
that was grapefruit juice by the way

5114.719 --> 5117.719
um

5126.56 --> 5130.679
that's a lot of jackdaws

5144.08 --> 5147.08
so

5154.719 --> 5160.36
all right elise g

5156.32 --> 5160.36
i'm glad you're liking it

5168.719 --> 5173.12
i personally

5170.96 --> 5174.639
oh i don't really prefer it anymore

5173.12 --> 5175.599999999999
because i haven't played it in a long

5174.639 --> 5178.96
time but

5175.6 --> 5182.320000000001
i've always liked dwarf fortress a lot

5178.96 --> 5184.159
which is yeah exclusively about dwarfs

5182.32 --> 5185.36
and mining

5184.159 --> 5188.159
and like

5185.36 --> 5189.839999999999
every type of material you know is in

5188.159 --> 5192.48
there it's like

5189.84 --> 5194.08
every type of stone every type of metal

5192.48 --> 5198.879999999999
is in there and there's this entire

5194.08 --> 5200.8
giant setup like how you make yeah from

5198.88 --> 5202.2390000000005
ore

5200.8 --> 5205.12
or rock

5202.239 --> 5207.5199999999995
to basically industrial goods and that's

5205.12 --> 5209.92
what that game is

5207.52 --> 5212.320000000001
it's all about that production it's

5209.92 --> 5215.8
fascinating i like it it's uh it's full

5212.32 --> 5215.799999999999
husky though

5248.4 --> 5251.4
right

5267.6 --> 5272.159000000001
so guys i think i'm gonna probably run

5269.84 --> 5274.88
out the show

5272.159 --> 5274.879999999999
unless somebody

5275.76 --> 5281.639
said something

5277.6 --> 5281.639
they wanted me to talk about

5283.76 --> 5287.12
never played a dwarf game that doesn't

5285.52 --> 5291.040000000001
mention elves yeah they seem to be

5287.12 --> 5292.8
intricately linked in stories

5291.04 --> 5295.84
what do you think of matrix4 i haven't

5292.8 --> 5295.84
seen it yet

5299.84 --> 5306.28
i'll probably check it out somewhere in

5302.159 --> 5306.28
the next few weeks

5313.12 --> 5316.12
hmm

5349.36 --> 5352.4
get about it

5353.44 --> 5355.759999999999
okay

5356.159 --> 5362.679
all right

5357.84 --> 5362.679
i'll i'll try to download it

5371.44 --> 5374.44
oh

5381.04 --> 5384.04
so

5399.12 --> 5402.159
forget about it

5402.239 --> 5405.239
what

5420.4 --> 5425.36
well look at you i've already heard that

5422.88 --> 5426.96
they they pretty much ruined

5425.36 --> 5429.759999999999
the movie

5426.96 --> 5432.719
or rather they're kind of like raping

5429.76 --> 5433.679
their own legacy

5432.719 --> 5435.04
so

5433.679 --> 5438.4800000000005
yeah

5435.04 --> 5438.48
i'm already expecting that

5444.4 --> 5450.08
i think it's better than most sequels

5447.36 --> 5452.239
well that's not very

5450.08 --> 5455.28
encouraging

5452.239 --> 5459.5199999999995
the classical homeopath because yeah

5455.28 --> 5462.2
most sequels nowadays really suck

5459.52 --> 5465.31
that's right oh it's better than that

5462.2 --> 5465.3099999999995
[Music]

5473.92 --> 5478.32
but okay look

5475.679 --> 5480.8
it might be kind of a

5478.32 --> 5483.199
a legacy rape movie where they [ __ ]

5480.8 --> 5485.12
their own mate the matrix over what it

5483.199 --> 5488.08
was

5485.12 --> 5491.04
but it might still be kind of a

5488.08 --> 5493.5199999999995
halfway decent put together concept in

5491.04 --> 5496.0
the rape of the previous

5493.52 --> 5498.2390000000005
movies right

5496.0 --> 5498.239
so

5498.719 --> 5503.08
i don't know what i'm gonna think about

5500.08 --> 5503.08
it

5504.639 --> 5508.4800000000005
i guess i'd have to watch it first

5509.84 --> 5514.56
love the new matrix despite its reviews

5512.0 --> 5516.32
okay well i'm not going by any reviews

5514.56 --> 5518.8
pj khrushchev

5516.32 --> 5522.159
because reviews are like

5518.8 --> 5522.159000000001
it's all over the place anyway

5526.56 --> 5533.52
but what i heard is just that the basic

5529.199 --> 5536.08
premise is kind of like just screwing up

5533.52 --> 5540.56
the old matrix idea

5536.08 --> 5542.159
and then trying to like just trying

5540.56 --> 5545.6
to

5542.159 --> 5549.599999999999
find a new angle of approach with it

5545.6 --> 5552.719
it's different yeah well different sucks

5549.6 --> 5555.1990000000005
you know you know about sequels sequels

5552.719 --> 5556.719
remember sequels of movies there's this

5555.199 --> 5558.08
thing about it

5556.719 --> 5560.159
different

5558.08 --> 5562.159
sucks

5560.159 --> 5564.0
that's why if there's a good movie and

5562.159 --> 5566.08
there's a sequel

5564.0 --> 5568.08
you don't make it different if you do

5566.08 --> 5570.639
that you're an idiot

5568.08 --> 5571.92
it that like that's

5570.639 --> 5573.679
a very

5571.92 --> 5575.6
bleak gamble

5573.679 --> 5577.679
rarely works out

5575.6 --> 5581.1990000000005
unless you have like a real vision you

5577.679 --> 5583.4400000000005
have like a trilogy idea

5581.199 --> 5586.839999999999
where they have to be separate because

5583.44 --> 5590.32
they're tied in together like if it's an

5586.84 --> 5592.159000000001
epos like a big story in three parts

5590.32 --> 5594.239
that's different right

5592.159 --> 5596.719
if you're gonna be like oh we're making

5594.239 --> 5598.239
a sequel to this

5596.719 --> 5601.36
yeah guess what

5598.239 --> 5603.678999999999
a sequel has to be roughly the same

5601.36 --> 5605.04
formula otherwise it's not really even a

5603.679 --> 5607.679
sequel

5605.04 --> 5609.28
makes no sense

5607.679 --> 5612.08
right

5609.28 --> 5613.599999999999
just think of the die hard movies

5612.08 --> 5616.6
right

5613.6 --> 5616.6
uh

5616.639 --> 5620.32
what if like die hard 2 or something was

5619.199 --> 5622.638999999999
different

5620.32 --> 5625.679
like oh yeah it's not about that same

5622.639 --> 5627.52
setup and he has to go die hard again

5625.679 --> 5629.4400000000005
yeah guess what it's going to suck

5627.52 --> 5631.280000000001
because it's different yeah it's not

5629.44 --> 5633.5199999999995
supposed to be different if it's a

5631.28 --> 5636.08
sequel

5633.52 --> 5638.0
they're not supposed to be different

5636.08 --> 5641.28
doesn't mean you have to be exactly

5638.0 --> 5643.04
mirror image you like

5641.28 --> 5644.5599999999995
but you shouldn't be making something

5643.04 --> 5646.88
completely different out of it because

5644.56 --> 5649.4400000000005
that's just gonna ruin the older

5646.88 --> 5649.4400000000005
versions

5654.88 --> 5662.08
the green u has gone oh

5657.28 --> 5662.08
okay doesn't make sense as a sequel

5662.96 --> 5666.6
if you say so

5677.36 --> 5682.5599999999995
not completely different okay well

5679.6 --> 5684.08
this is not helping me i don't know now

5682.56 --> 5686.0
this is

5684.08 --> 5689.36
right but anyway i'll just check it out

5686.0 --> 5689.36
at some point and then

5689.84 --> 5693.52
i'll give you guys my opinion

5697.36 --> 5701.839999999999
they redefined the one well that's lame

5706.719 --> 5711.04
right so they basically broke up the old

5711.119 --> 5715.679
idea although you have to realize though

5713.6 --> 5717.360000000001
that the one

5715.679 --> 5718.639
that morpheus

5717.36 --> 5721.119
basically

5718.639 --> 5723.52
upheld in the in the original matrix

5721.119 --> 5725.5199999999995
movies that he was

5723.52 --> 5727.679
wrong

5725.52 --> 5729.76
right he was

5727.679 --> 5732.4
like

5729.76 --> 5735.280000000001
the architect and all that incorporated

5732.4 --> 5737.28
the concept of the one

5735.28 --> 5740.159
and he was changing things and changing

5737.28 --> 5743.199
things with every new version

5740.159 --> 5745.599999999999
like an evolution but yeah that also

5743.199 --> 5747.44
means that there's definitely an ability

5745.6 --> 5750.719
that at some point which would probably

5747.44 --> 5753.759999999999
be the last or the third matrix movie

5750.719 --> 5757.52
where the new reset would result in

5753.76 --> 5759.52
it working completely different

5757.52 --> 5762.320000000001
no the one was alive from the yeah but

5759.52 --> 5762.320000000001
that's [ __ ]

5765.28 --> 5771.04
like it can't be a lie because then the

5768.239 --> 5773.199
architect would have been wrong

5771.04 --> 5775.44
he isn't wrong

5773.199 --> 5778.239
right even if he had manipulated

5775.44 --> 5780.0
everybody into the idea of thinking that

5778.239 --> 5782.0
the one exists

5780.0 --> 5783.76
then it exists because he is the

5782.0 --> 5786.8
architect

5783.76 --> 5789.360000000001
doesn't matter if he knows it's actually

5786.8 --> 5791.28
a ruse it's real because it's part of

5789.36 --> 5793.199
the design as he made it

5791.28 --> 5796.239
as the information that is spreading so

5793.199 --> 5798.4
that makes no damn sense

5796.239 --> 5801.678999999999
it cannot be a lie

5798.4 --> 5802.879999999999
because it's part of the design

5801.679 --> 5808.2390000000005
although

5802.88 --> 5808.2390000000005
morpheus was right wrong effectively

5808.8 --> 5813.6
and has even admitted

5810.84 --> 5816.56
that it just didn't matter at some point

5813.6 --> 5819.4400000000005
anymore it had moved beyond it the

5816.56 --> 5822.0
situation had moved beyond the one

5819.44 --> 5822.0
kind of thing

5823.52 --> 5830.6
the anomaly is true the one is not okay

5827.6 --> 5830.6
fine

5841.92 --> 5846.4
all right well anyway we'll see what's

5843.92 --> 5846.4
going to happen

5849.119 --> 5853.199
but yeah i've i'm kind of hard

5851.28 --> 5855.119
what do you call that bit hard-headed at

5853.199 --> 5857.678999999999
it like i'm not expecting this to be

5855.119 --> 5860.08
good at all

5857.679 --> 5863.1990000000005
because you know why also because i've

5860.08 --> 5864.239
freaking seen keanu reeves

5863.199 --> 5865.919999999999
dude

5864.239 --> 5869.839999999999
keanu reeve

5865.92 --> 5871.28
sucks i'm sorry dude you suck

5869.84 --> 5874.400000000001
you suck

5871.28 --> 5876.159
i'm not taking it back you suck

5874.4 --> 5878.799999999999
you've gone worse

5876.159 --> 5882.32
you know you were like a wooden plank

5878.8 --> 5883.84
during the matrix the first three movies

5882.32 --> 5886.32
and that was fine

5883.84 --> 5888.8
it kind of needed a wooden plank like

5886.32 --> 5891.159
that you were perfect for that

5888.8 --> 5893.6
yeah well this

5891.159 --> 5896.08
characteristics of yourself you've been

5893.6 --> 5897.92
developing in the last 20 years are

5896.08 --> 5900.159
atrocious

5897.92 --> 5903.36
it's like could you please

5900.159 --> 5905.04
just shave those shavings off the wooden

5903.36 --> 5908.799999999999
plank again and just be the wooden plank

5905.04 --> 5911.679
because what you've become is disgusting

5908.8 --> 5914.400000000001
like every time i see you somewhere and

5911.679 --> 5915.76
you show anything other than just wooden

5914.4 --> 5918.719
plank face

5915.76 --> 5919.92
i'm repulsed by what i see and feel

5918.719 --> 5921.44
dude

5919.92 --> 5922.4
you suck

5921.44 --> 5925.28
so

5922.4 --> 5927.599999999999
this matrix cannot be great

5925.28 --> 5930.08
because it had keanu reeves in it and he

5927.6 --> 5930.08
sucks

5933.679 --> 5936.679
ugh

5938.96 --> 5944.719
as an actor that is i don't know as a

5941.199 --> 5947.759999999999
person because he might be pretty decent

5944.719 --> 5950.56
as an actor he sucks

5947.76 --> 5953.719
dude maybe watching like though what is

5950.56 --> 5953.719
it again

5954.32 --> 5960.08
the third villain ted movie

5957.52 --> 5962.719
maybe seeing him in that just like

5960.08 --> 5964.96
permanently ruined it for me

5962.719 --> 5969.119
it was so bad

5964.96 --> 5970.96
so [ __ ] annoying that it's like

5969.119 --> 5972.639
it wasn't the only like everybody

5970.96 --> 5975.36
thought he was annoying

5972.639 --> 5977.1990000000005
like the actors thought he was annoying

5975.36 --> 5979.36
like they couldn't hide that

5977.199 --> 5981.919999999999
they were all being like yeah

5979.36 --> 5983.92
we're into it and he's like oh oh i'm

5981.92 --> 5986.639
barely an actor

5983.92 --> 5988.96
like oh you can't even act like you're

5986.639 --> 5992.2390000000005
one of your main characters like what

5988.96 --> 5993.44
kind of an actor are you dude you suck

5992.239 --> 5995.678999999999
like you

5993.44 --> 5998.719
suck

5995.679 --> 6001.28
keanu reeves you suck

5998.719 --> 6006.52
you should retire forever

6001.28 --> 6006.5199999999995
just get the [ __ ] off the stage you suck

6009.11 --> 6012.429999999999
[Music]

6018.239 --> 6023.28
he's one of the worst actors ever yeah

6020.56 --> 6025.360000000001
yeah he is that bad

6023.28 --> 6028.08
neil he is

6025.36 --> 6030.5599999999995
cobra kai has nothing to do with it

6028.08 --> 6031.92
keanu roose is not in cobra kai kobrakai

6030.56 --> 6035.4400000000005
is epic

6031.92 --> 6036.96
i've watched the new season it was epic

6035.44 --> 6039.44
dude like

6036.96 --> 6042.08
that siri it might be like the best

6039.44 --> 6045.44
series this century i'm serious it's

6042.08 --> 6048.719
like really great the series is almost

6045.44 --> 6048.719
better than the original

6048.84 --> 6052.56
movies it's epic

6053.28 --> 6058.5599999999995
did i see him in dracula

6055.36 --> 6058.5599999999995
no i think i skipped that

6059.199 --> 6062.719
but he sucks in everything

6063.36 --> 6067.759999999999
like literally every time i see keanu

6066.0 --> 6070.199
reeves in something

6067.76 --> 6074.0
where he tries to act he

6070.199 --> 6076.799999999999
sucks it's like dude

6074.0 --> 6079.52
like could you just please stay like a

6076.8 --> 6082.0
robot don't take any

6079.52 --> 6084.0
directions from the director or whatever

6082.0 --> 6086.88
telling you how to act just

6084.0 --> 6089.44
just don't have any expressions ever

6086.88 --> 6093.4400000000005
just be a wooden plank please for the

6089.44 --> 6094.32
love of god just be a wooden plank don't

6093.44 --> 6098.48
ever

6094.32 --> 6102.08
ever again try to act you suck

6098.48 --> 6104.638999999999
you literally drain the life essence

6102.08 --> 6105.5199999999995
out of the viewer every time you try to

6104.639 --> 6110.04
act

6105.52 --> 6110.040000000001
never do that again ever

6120.56 --> 6126.0
point break yeah well dude maybe the

6122.719 --> 6128.719
earlier things you know

6126.0 --> 6131.119
say the 20s late 20th century

6128.719 --> 6133.84
it was kind of okay you know

6131.119 --> 6136.0
in speed i thought it was pretty okay

6133.84 --> 6137.6
it's just that in the last 20 years i

6136.0 --> 6140.88
don't know what the [ __ ] happened to him

6137.6 --> 6142.96
but it's just disgusting

6140.88 --> 6146.2390000000005
like every time he tries to act now is

6142.96 --> 6149.44
just radiating malice

6146.239 --> 6151.759999999999
and repulsion i can't i don't understand

6149.44 --> 6151.759999999999
why

6154.48 --> 6159.04
in the 90s he was it was pretty okay i

6156.88 --> 6160.84
mean he was still a sucky actor but he

6159.04 --> 6164.239
was still kind of like

6160.84 --> 6166.639
okay to have around in the movies

6164.239 --> 6168.159
it's just disgusting now

6166.639 --> 6170.719
every time

6168.159 --> 6173.04
it just sucks

6170.719 --> 6177.08
like only the

6173.04 --> 6177.08
what do you call them again the uh

6178.88 --> 6181.4400000000005
the

6179.679 --> 6184.32
jesuit thing

6181.44 --> 6186.5599999999995
it just shoots everybody the [ __ ] is

6184.32 --> 6187.679
that serious call in that he was kind of

6186.56 --> 6190.0
okay

6187.679 --> 6193.119
john wick yeah that's like the only

6190.0 --> 6197.04
movie series he's okay why

6193.119 --> 6199.36
because that movie serie is atrocious

6197.04 --> 6202.32
like it's supposed to it's like a giant

6199.36 --> 6205.199
nightmare the entire thing the entire

6202.32 --> 6208.159
movie series of that is one giant

6205.199 --> 6210.239
nightmare literally a giant nightmare

6208.159 --> 6213.44
oh his acting

6210.239 --> 6215.44
fits perfectly in there also he is very

6213.44 --> 6217.839999999999
stoic so he actually sticks to the

6215.44 --> 6220.32
wooden plank format which is his

6217.84 --> 6222.4800000000005
redemption in that right because as soon

6220.32 --> 6224.5599999999995
as he actually tries to act like

6222.48 --> 6227.199
something it's just

6224.56 --> 6232.280000000001
almost instant vomit

6227.199 --> 6232.28
just don't ever try that again please

6244.159 --> 6248.08
he is supposed to be the way he is in

6246.4 --> 6251.5199999999995
john wick yeah because he doesn't

6248.08 --> 6253.92
attempt acting there he's just stoic

6251.52 --> 6256.4800000000005
like he should dude

6253.92 --> 6258.719
if he'd literally had face muscle

6256.48 --> 6261.04
paralyzation

6258.719 --> 6263.119
that might actually be like a good for

6261.04 --> 6265.679
his career because then he couldn't

6263.119 --> 6267.759999999999
attempt to act anymore

6265.679 --> 6270.159
he could just only talk

6267.76 --> 6275.0
and just be stoic because he should

6270.159 --> 6275.0
never try to act again ever

6277.04 --> 6279.44
oh yeah

6281.44 --> 6285.199
a crease is gonna be redeemed something

6283.92 --> 6287.52
like that neil

6285.199 --> 6289.919999999999
something like that it's definitely it

6287.52 --> 6291.360000000001
rounded out very interesting that last

6289.92 --> 6293.92
season

6291.36 --> 6296.799999999999
i really like that creepy guy

6293.92 --> 6299.1990000000005
because the new way he was

6296.8 --> 6300.2390000000005
that guy is like a really well developed

6299.199 --> 6302.239
character

6300.239 --> 6303.44
like in the original movie he was just

6302.239 --> 6305.759999999999
like this

6303.44 --> 6309.5199999999995
maniac scary i thought like it was

6305.76 --> 6314.320000000001
genuinely a scary weirdo crazy guy

6309.52 --> 6316.8
now he's like a matured crazy wine

6314.32 --> 6319.28
and i thought it was just portrayed very

6316.8 --> 6321.52
interesting

6319.28 --> 6321.5199999999995
like

6324.159 --> 6328.799999999999
terry silver

6325.6 --> 6330.639
yeah i thought he was a very fascinating

6328.8 --> 6333.92
villain character in that movie in the

6330.639 --> 6333.92
series very great

6334.239 --> 6337.839999999999
i thought he was like gonna be a genuine

6336.48 --> 6339.44
like good

6337.84 --> 6342.0
but dark guy

6339.44 --> 6345.119
but then he basically fell back into his

6342.0 --> 6348.719
old psychopathy trickery yeah excellent

6345.119 --> 6348.719
writers the best dude

6348.88 --> 6355.6
like kobrakai is turning in my opinion

6351.84 --> 6358.32
into like the best series this century

6355.6 --> 6360.0
like i can't i can't think of anything

6358.32 --> 6363.119
else that kind of like

6360.0 --> 6365.44
manages to get me that grit and that's

6363.119 --> 6367.5199999999995
sympathetic it's like i like almost

6365.44 --> 6369.839999999999
everything that's in there

6367.52 --> 6371.360000000001
so it was no exception every character

6369.84 --> 6373.76
is just interesting

6371.36 --> 6376.639
and real

6373.76 --> 6376.639
well-rounded

6378.0 --> 6381.52
and will smith turned out in the role of

6379.92 --> 6385.639
neo yep

6381.52 --> 6385.639
yeah but that would have been a mess

6395.04 --> 6401.8
yeah but he did take men in black though

6397.679 --> 6401.8
and that was a really great movie

6401.84 --> 6408.639
he was perfect for that will smith

6404.48 --> 6408.638999999999
could you imagine that will smith and

6408.88 --> 6414.08
keanu reeves changed exchanged roles

6411.92 --> 6415.92
that will smith was in the matrix and

6414.08 --> 6419.04
keanu reeves

6415.92 --> 6419.04
got in man in black

6419.84 --> 6423.4800000000005
that would be weird

6428.32 --> 6432.719
favorite is definitely johnny lauren

6429.92 --> 6435.119
yeah i know it is neil

6432.719 --> 6437.28
johnny lawrence is made for guys like

6435.119 --> 6437.28
you

6439.28 --> 6444.639
i thought it was really funny that he's

6440.88 --> 6444.639
like a big fan of rowdy piper

6445.52 --> 6450.56
that was pretty cool

6447.119 --> 6450.5599999999995
no i like that character too

6454.56 --> 6460.2390000000005
well check check out the amount of

6456.639 --> 6463.119
jackdaws over there in the tree

6460.239 --> 6463.119
that's crazy

6466.0 --> 6469.48
can you see that

6474.639 --> 6477.639
so

6487.84 --> 6493.0
there's like 50 or 60 of those

6502.4 --> 6505.4
mm-hmm

6517.36 --> 6521.44
i'm freaking freezing rain at the moment

6519.28 --> 6524.96
oh dear yeah that sucks neil

6521.44 --> 6526.799999999999
yeah yesterday was wetland like that

6524.96 --> 6529.199
yesterday the weather sucked it was like

6526.8 --> 6530.96
raining all the time also this night it

6529.199 --> 6535.4
was raining all the time

6530.96 --> 6535.4
today's been very nice so

6541.84 --> 6545.84
it's like fireworks check it out

6551.04 --> 6554.84
that's a lot of jackdaws

6560.56 --> 6567.2390000000005
it's like they all gathered in just a

6562.8 --> 6567.2390000000005
street in that one tree there

6579.92 --> 6583.4400000000005
yeah pj crew shank i agree yeah johnny

6582.159 --> 6585.679
lawrence

6583.44 --> 6588.5599999999995
well he was just a dick and he's still a

6585.679 --> 6590.719
dick but he's like a dick that still is

6588.56 --> 6593.4400000000005
kind of cool

6590.719 --> 6596.76
it's like he used his dickishness for a

6593.44 --> 6596.759999999999
good purpose

6602.48 --> 6607.919999999999
and daniel yeah well daniel is daniel he

6605.92 --> 6609.36
developed

6607.92 --> 6610.96
logically

6609.36 --> 6613.839999999999
he's different though than when he was

6610.96 --> 6616.08
younger but he developed logically i

6613.84 --> 6616.08
think

6618.0 --> 6623.88
but yeah most of the characters in that

6620.239 --> 6623.879999999999
series are likable

6625.599 --> 6630.88
like even the the bad asses

6630.0 --> 6631.84
have

6630.88 --> 6634.08
like

6631.84 --> 6636.2390000000005
you still can't help but root for them

6634.08 --> 6638.08
in some way because yeah things turn

6636.239 --> 6639.28
around a lot and you're just like oh

6638.08 --> 6642.96
come on

6639.28 --> 6642.96
