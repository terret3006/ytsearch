appreciated

95.119 --> 103.36
right so today the weather is

100.32 --> 107.67999999999999
very much like yesterday it's

103.36 --> 108.479
currently it's really exactly the same

107.68 --> 115.119
it's just

108.479 --> 118.719
it is constantly snowing

115.119 --> 120.64
i think that it's it's not snowing super

118.719 --> 123.119
hard anymore

120.64 --> 125.68
but it is still just constantly snowing

123.119 --> 125.68
slightly

127.84 --> 132.16
so yeah it is quite cold out outside

132.64 --> 138.07999999999998
but it's not as moist so i don't know it

135.52 --> 138.08
is doable

141.44 --> 143.84
all right

146.08 --> 157.519
all right so it's monday

149.36 --> 160.72000000000003
february 8th 2021

157.519 --> 164.4
yesterday for me was uh

160.72 --> 164.4
quite quite a mixed day

166.4 --> 172.16
one part was pretty good and the other

169.12 --> 177.28
was nerve-racking

172.16 --> 177.28
just to at some point something

178.0 --> 185.519
yeah things went wrong and then just a

181.04 --> 189.76
cascade of annoyance

185.519 --> 192.72
but yeah i survived through it sort of

189.76 --> 199.84
some people in skype will know what i'm

192.72 --> 202.159
talking about

199.84 --> 202.959
but uh yeah i went out for groceries

202.159 --> 205.599
yesterday

202.959 --> 207.2
in this snow took my umbrella which i

205.599 --> 208.0
thought was a really smart thing and it

207.2 --> 211.11999999999998
was

208.0 --> 212.72
it was very handy to have because i

211.12 --> 216.0
don't have a

212.72 --> 216.48
like a hat or anything although yeah you

216.0 --> 219.28
know what

216.48 --> 219.84
typically a winter head might be

219.28 --> 221.76
actually

219.84 --> 223.20000000000002
kind of a good idea at some point if

221.76 --> 227.28
this

223.2 --> 230.159
type of cold persists

227.28 --> 231.76
but uh yeah the umbrella sufficed

230.159 --> 233.67999999999998
because i went walking

231.76 --> 237.12
took a lot longer though because of that

233.68 --> 240.87900000000002
because it is a bit of a distance

237.12 --> 241.76
but it was in a way fun except for when

240.879 --> 245.35999999999999
i came back

241.76 --> 248.0
i really had to go to the bathroom

245.36 --> 248.4
and like that started to hurt at some

248.0 --> 251.76
point

248.4 --> 254.08
i didn't know this a lot of

251.76 --> 257.03999999999996
people probably had an experience like

254.08 --> 261.199
this one way or another in their life

257.04 --> 261.199
but for me yeah

262.72 --> 270.0
it got me quite agitated when i got home

266.479 --> 272.88
and then yeah in my hurry i really like

270.0 --> 273.84
just tried to throw off my jacket and my

272.88 --> 276.71999999999997
bag

273.84 --> 278.71999999999997
and i had a bit trouble with that just

276.72 --> 279.84000000000003
yeah to get into that bathroom very

278.72 --> 282.40000000000003
quickly

279.84 --> 284.79999999999995
and then it after yeah it just pisses

282.4 --> 286.63899999999995
pissed me off because it hurt

284.8 --> 289.28000000000003
and i was trying to basically not

286.639 --> 289.28000000000003
explode

290.479 --> 296.8
and then afterward found out

293.759 --> 298.96000000000004
that when i dropped my bag i broke yeah

296.8 --> 302.479
one of the bottles on a beer bottle

298.96 --> 305.35999999999996
right and that was extremely annoying

302.479 --> 307.68
because yeah i do i don't know if i even

305.36 --> 310.72
openly shared this but i do drink

307.68 --> 312.16
right again like i did quit for a while

310.72 --> 315.28000000000003
but

312.16 --> 315.84000000000003
i'm kind of back where i started with

315.28 --> 318.88
that

315.84 --> 320.96
and it's been going pretty fine but

318.88 --> 322.479
yeah in this case it just pissed me off

320.96 --> 325.19899999999996
really bad in my

322.479 --> 326.96
bag that is like the thing that i daily

325.199 --> 329.52000000000004
use

326.96 --> 331.75899999999996
it's all covered in beer and [ __ ] and

329.52 --> 334.79999999999995
this just like ah

331.759 --> 339.28000000000003
that really just ruined it for me after

334.8 --> 341.039
that point and then somebody called the

339.28 --> 344.32
police on me again

341.039 --> 346.8
and it was the craziest thing

344.32 --> 348.32
because yeah they called the police

346.8 --> 351.52000000000004
apparently

348.32 --> 352.08
yeah great isn't it oh that's just what

351.52 --> 355.35999999999996
you need

352.08 --> 357.75899999999996
on top of all of that and they said that

355.36 --> 358.319
there was domestic violence going on

357.759 --> 361.36
here like

358.319 --> 365.12
what i was completely at home

361.36 --> 368.47900000000004
alone so

365.12 --> 368.88
yeah they came and i was like oh my god

368.479 --> 370.8
no

368.88 --> 373.199
this is gonna mean that my landlord's

370.8 --> 375.52000000000004
gonna get all riled up again

373.199 --> 377.68
and start whining and sending messages

375.52 --> 380.15999999999997
to my dad and [ __ ]

377.68 --> 382.16
so yeah that's how suddenly the day

380.16 --> 383.44
turns all shitty and it in it kind of

382.16 --> 386.319
did

383.44 --> 387.199
right because my landlord did call me up

386.319 --> 389.52000000000004
right after

387.199 --> 391.68
and just like i had to hang up like

389.52 --> 393.35999999999996
halfway because he was just spouting the

391.68 --> 395.36
same nonsense like oh i'm gonna find

393.36 --> 398.56
somebody new to replace you

395.36 --> 398.56
it's like no

402.56 --> 411.28000000000003
anyway hello dutch sailor agm 1966

408.639 --> 411.84000000000003
yeah dutch sailor but i think it's like

411.28 --> 416.08
a

411.84 --> 419.28
neighbor down from me

416.08 --> 420.08
i think that they might be unfortunately

419.28 --> 422.96
hearing me

420.08 --> 424.31899999999996
when i get a bit loud when i like get

422.96 --> 427.68
really pissed off which

424.319 --> 430.24
usually directed at myself

427.68 --> 431.36
i think it bothers them or it scares the

430.24 --> 433.759
[ __ ] out of them

431.36 --> 434.88
when they're there and they're like very

433.759 --> 437.84000000000003
trigger happy

434.88 --> 440.08
calling the cops on people or something

437.84 --> 440.08
so

441.52 --> 447.599
which is a huge

444.72 --> 447.59900000000005
problem really

447.75 --> 453.199
[Music]

448.96 --> 455.84
but i guess that the way the world works

453.199 --> 458.319
out there right now

455.84 --> 459.28
yeah that's that was bound to happen at

458.319 --> 461.68
some point

459.28 --> 464.15999999999997
people are more high on their nerves

461.68 --> 467.28000000000003
they are more at home

464.16 --> 470.639
and they will do these things quicker

467.28 --> 471.84
under all this pressure and besides

470.639 --> 474.879
they're like

471.84 --> 476.15999999999997
totally statist probably so there's no

474.879 --> 479.199
way that i could probably

476.16 --> 484.0
talk them out of doing that

479.199 --> 486.0
right and i don't even know who it is

484.0 --> 488.8
i don't know who it is and i don't know

486.0 --> 490.479
man they're probably afraid of me now

488.8 --> 493.84000000000003
even though they've never talked to me

490.479 --> 493.84
face to face

495.84 --> 499.84
it's a pretty shitty situation on the

497.84 --> 502.23999999999995
long run

499.84 --> 503.28
but if i just sit through it and stand

502.24 --> 507.52
on my right

503.28 --> 509.599
it's like yeah oh yeah yeah yeah oh just

507.52 --> 511.12
just because i'm such a nice guy i'll

509.599 --> 512.8
just get out of home and

511.12 --> 514.8
just be homeless just like that in the

512.8 --> 517.76
middle of winter and

514.8 --> 519.12
because i can find a room so easily out

517.76 --> 523.4399999999999
there just like that right

519.12 --> 523.44
yeah yeah no no

525.12 --> 527.519
anyway

529.279 --> 532.48
so i'm a little bit tense because of

531.2 --> 535.44
that but i'm just

532.48 --> 549.839
pushing it to the back because there is

535.44 --> 549.839
shouldn't be any immediate danger

550.32 --> 556.399
oh what

553.6 --> 556.9590000000001
maybe you should invite your neighbors

556.399 --> 559.44
well

556.959 --> 560.8
there's a lot of neighbors because this

559.44 --> 562.6400000000001
is like

560.8 --> 566.24
there's a lot of student homes around

562.64 --> 570.8
here and people come and go

566.24 --> 577.279
pretty rapidly so i i don't have any

570.8 --> 580.0799999999999
well consistent neighbors

577.279 --> 581.6
well i have some and they know me like

580.08 --> 584.48
i've been living here for now

581.6 --> 586.24
seven years and so there are neighbors

584.48 --> 587.12
that have been living here forever and

586.24 --> 590.64
they know

587.12 --> 593.2
they know who i am they even addressed

590.64 --> 593.1999999999999
some of it

594.48 --> 598.16
right because they were questioning like

596.399 --> 601.12
hey is that

598.16 --> 603.4399999999999
you that is so loud sometimes and then

601.12 --> 605.12
i'm like yeah yeah i'm very sorry i just

603.44 --> 609.12
get

605.12 --> 613.04
very nervous sometimes and then

609.12 --> 614.8
that happens it's like it's almost like

613.04 --> 616.64
turrets but it's not

614.8 --> 618.0
like tourette's it's difficult to

616.64 --> 620.64
explain i don't even know

618.0 --> 620.64
what it is

628.64 --> 633.04
and people in my past because i've had

631.68 --> 635.5999999999999
this sort of impulse

633.04 --> 637.519
pretty much since i was a kid it just

635.6 --> 640.399
happened sometimes

637.519 --> 641.68
and then that i would just get very very

640.399 --> 643.76
pissed off

641.68 --> 645.519
like almost possessed with anger it used

643.76 --> 649.12
to be much worse when i was younger

645.519 --> 650.399
right there was no way i could even hold

649.12 --> 653.24
any of it back

650.399 --> 654.8
and people have tried to identify it

653.24 --> 658.0790000000001
periodically over

654.8 --> 661.279
my life and nobody really

658.079 --> 665.1999999999999
came to a conclusion there were some

661.279 --> 667.76
people that were not in a regular

665.2 --> 668.6400000000001
medical profession that i've heard that

667.76 --> 671.68
said it's

668.64 --> 675.36
laban schmatz it's like just

671.68 --> 676.959
pain of life that then culminates and

675.36 --> 679.36
then

676.959 --> 680.56
pushes its way out and i found that

679.36 --> 683.519
description to be

680.56 --> 683.5189999999999
pretty accurate

684.32 --> 687.6
and that's as far as i've gone with it

686.959 --> 689.3599999999999
and i

687.6 --> 690.64
really don't know what to do about it

689.36 --> 692.64
guys it's like

690.64 --> 694.64
yeah everybody gets angry right every

692.64 --> 698.24
now and then

694.64 --> 701.279
but with me sometimes it i just get

698.24 --> 703.04
more angry than the average person and

701.279 --> 706.32
it's

703.04 --> 710.399
apparently very threatening

706.32 --> 710.399
i don't know though i've never

712.72 --> 718.639
experienced it as another person what it

716.0 --> 720.88
is like to hear myself when i'm like

718.639 --> 720.88
that

724.8 --> 729.519
and when i try to think about that it

726.56 --> 731.3599999999999
makes me very nervous

729.519 --> 732.9590000000001
with practice anyone can control their

731.36 --> 735.2
anger well i've certainly been thinking

732.959 --> 738.3199999999999
about that a lot more

735.2 --> 738.32
like how do i do that

738.399 --> 742.399
when like everything goes to [ __ ] and

740.399 --> 745.839
you're physically hurting like

742.399 --> 745.839
how do you

747.36 --> 751.839
how do you basically keep it in you and

749.92 --> 759.8389999999999
not just

751.839 --> 759.839
like get a nervous breakdown

763.2 --> 769.44
old stomach like some sickness i don't

765.92 --> 769.4399999999999
never heard of that doctor gonza

770.959 --> 787.8389999999999
you say my name turret3o6

788.959 --> 791.68
good to see you

792.48 --> 797.9200000000001
i said turrets turret

798.839 --> 804.24
tourette

800.399 --> 804.24
as in jill de la tourette

804.48 --> 809.6800000000001
it's like well but that is different

807.519 --> 810.9590000000001
people do understand that though if it's

809.68 --> 812.399
chilled out tourette's you have it

810.959 --> 815.4399999999999
constantly

812.399 --> 817.92
it's like a lower lower threshold with

815.44 --> 819.0400000000001
me the threshold is much higher but when

817.92 --> 822.3199999999999
it goes over that

819.04 --> 822.3199999999999
it really comes out

823.199 --> 828.3199999999999
do i live along with others well i do

826.56 --> 831.04
have roommates

828.32 --> 833.44
but i do pay a lot of attention not to

831.04 --> 837.04
explode on them

833.44 --> 837.0400000000001
or like when they're in the house

838.8 --> 843.04
like i really really try not to bother

842.079 --> 847.279
people with it

843.04 --> 847.279
okay it's tough

848.079 --> 852.4799999999999
but i've gotten an understanding with

850.56 --> 856.0
with some people

852.48 --> 859.279
that get it and they know

856.0 --> 859.279
too that like i

860.399 --> 867.76
try to kind of like compensate for it

863.519 --> 870.88
with just being as helpful as i can

867.76 --> 874.399
and i never like bring

870.88 --> 885.8389999999999
negativity actively face to face i just

874.399 --> 885.839
i never do things like that so

888.56 --> 892.56
you know and that's the weird thing when

891.36 --> 895.36
there is like

892.56 --> 898.2399999999999
arguments some people then explode and

895.36 --> 901.1990000000001
it typically happens face to face that's

898.24 --> 904.0790000000001
what you see out there the most right

901.199 --> 906.4799999999999
that doesn't happen to me

904.079 --> 907.519
like so i'm never going to like really

906.48 --> 910.72
like verbally

907.519 --> 913.12
attack somebody right that never happens

910.72 --> 916.48
face to face like never

913.12 --> 918.399
i've managed to make a system in myself

916.48 --> 920.72
that completely prevents it

918.399 --> 923.199
but i do build tension and sometimes i

920.72 --> 927.839
just have to kind of like vent it so i

923.199 --> 927.8389999999999
start just yelling at the air at myself

929.92 --> 935.279
but unfortunately that does get a little

932.959 --> 935.279
loud

938.839 --> 941.839
sometimes

955.04 --> 958.7199999999999
ah okay dutch sailor

960.0 --> 966.24
i was plaguing you for five years right

962.639 --> 968.5600000000001
well nobody's really plaguing me

966.24 --> 969.6800000000001
it's just i don't know there's just some

968.56 --> 972.4799999999999
person i guess

969.68 --> 974.16
that every time i get loud and they are

972.48 --> 977.44
present

974.16 --> 979.6
they tend to call the police

977.44 --> 983.839
in this case it was really weird because

979.6 --> 983.839
it was even pretty short

985.36 --> 988.5600000000001
and i don't know why they would say

987.199 --> 996.56
domestic violence

988.56 --> 998.6389999999999
that that's just absurd and i really

996.56 --> 1001.7589999999999
don't like the implication of that

998.639 --> 1003.92
just that somebody would think that it's

1001.759 --> 1006.16
like what the hell dude i would never do

1003.92 --> 1006.16
that

1009.44 --> 1016.639
wood splitting yeah that would be cute

1012.639 --> 1016.639
if i'd had if i'd had some

1018.079 --> 1021.4399999999999
oh yeah at least i'm not blasting dutch

1020.32 --> 1022.88
hover

1021.44 --> 1024.559
out of speed yeah yeah there are some

1022.88 --> 1028.16
people that do that

1024.559 --> 1030.6399999999999
there's even somebody around here that

1028.16 --> 1034.4
has that tendency sometimes

1030.64 --> 1038.72
yeah you hear me complaining about it

1034.4 --> 1040.64
not really it is annoying

1038.72 --> 1042.88
but i'm not just gonna call the police

1040.64 --> 1045.1200000000001
every time i hear that [ __ ]

1042.88 --> 1046.5590000000002
i'm not like that ever because a lot of

1045.12 --> 1048.799
people just have

1046.559 --> 1049.9189999999999
issues like i'm used to that it's all

1048.799 --> 1053.2
people deal

1049.919 --> 1055.2800000000002
with anger [ __ ] in all kinds of ways

1053.2 --> 1056.96
all the time and there's a lot of people

1055.28 --> 1059.36
living in a city

1056.96 --> 1061.039
right it's just you gotta have to deal

1059.36 --> 1067.84
with it from each other and just

1061.039 --> 1067.84
not pile on more [ __ ]

1071.6 --> 1075.36
and i've been trying to live like that

1073.44 --> 1081.28
but unfortunately this

1075.36 --> 1083.6
doesn't seem to be accepted

1081.28 --> 1084.48
maybe it is it's just my landlord who's

1083.6 --> 1087.6789999999999
just

1084.48 --> 1095.84
wanting to me to get out because

1087.679 --> 1095.8400000000001
probably i'm not profitable

1097.2 --> 1100.559
like yeah i don't know

1103.38 --> 1107.5200000000002
[Music]

1105.919 --> 1110.0800000000002
all right he doesn't know what to do

1107.52 --> 1110.08
with that

1110.32 --> 1112.96
like i'm not easy going because of this

1112.64 --> 1114.3200000000002
issue

1112.96 --> 1117.1200000000001
[Music]

1114.32 --> 1119.6
unfortunately and not from communication

1117.12 --> 1122.3999999999999
standpoint it's just that

1119.6 --> 1123.76
me being here doesn't make things easy

1122.4 --> 1127.679
for him i guess

1123.76 --> 1127.679
i'm really sorry i

1131.28 --> 1136.24
and i paid my rent every single time

1134.08 --> 1140.559
never miss the payment

1136.24 --> 1140.559
not even yeah not ever

1143.039 --> 1149.6
and i help the guy out constantly

1146.32 --> 1151.76
i'm basically at his surface here

1149.6 --> 1153.1999999999998
like there's been like things broken

1151.76 --> 1156.24
that i would fix

1153.2 --> 1157.76
for him just completely voluntarily even

1156.24 --> 1160.0
though i

1157.76 --> 1162.0
he requires he is actually required to

1160.0 --> 1165.28
do that himself

1162.0 --> 1167.679
as a landlord right so

1165.28 --> 1167.6789999999999
you know

1168.799 --> 1172.799
but it doesn't really seem to matter to

1170.64 --> 1172.7990000000002
him

1173.12 --> 1180.799
it's just taking that for granted

1179.12 --> 1182.2399999999998
then i should have nothing to worry well

1180.799 --> 1184.559
technically i

1182.24 --> 1186.48
i am in a situation where like he

1184.559 --> 1188.16
couldn't get me out like i've done

1186.48 --> 1189.6
nothing wrong i've just been a little

1188.16 --> 1192.88
loud sometimes and just

1189.6 --> 1195.12
police being called on me

1192.88 --> 1198.24
doesn't mean anything it means

1195.12 --> 1202.0
somebody's calling the police on me

1198.24 --> 1202.0
right unless they actually can

1202.159 --> 1210.0
have something to basically report on

1207.12 --> 1212.1589999999999
except me maybe not being in the nicest

1210.0 --> 1214.159
of moods and i've never

1212.159 --> 1216.48
like yelled at the police or anything

1214.159 --> 1217.919
ever would never do that's completely

1216.48 --> 1220.159
useless

1217.919 --> 1221.919
but i was in a cranky mood yesterday

1220.159 --> 1224.5590000000002
when they came i was like oh

1221.919 --> 1224.5590000000002
like what

1225.039 --> 1228.8799999999999
and i didn't let them in and i regret

1227.28 --> 1230.799
that i should have let them in it's just

1228.88 --> 1232.4
my first response police at the door i

1230.799 --> 1234.4
didn't even trust

1232.4 --> 1237.52
i don't necessarily even trust police

1234.4 --> 1241.76
when i when they show up

1237.52 --> 1245.039
you know they could be somebody else

1241.76 --> 1247.44
posing as police although yeah at first

1245.039 --> 1250.24
dance right

1247.44 --> 1250.559
so i never just outright invite police

1250.24 --> 1253.44
in

1250.559 --> 1254.6399999999999
if i if if i'm not entirely sure but i

1253.44 --> 1256.64
should have let them in

1254.64 --> 1258.159
and i'm kind of feeling stupid about

1256.64 --> 1260.24
that and they would turn out to be

1258.159 --> 1262.4
pretty okay guys

1260.24 --> 1264.72
like they they weren't part of anything

1262.4 --> 1268.3200000000002
they were just called on and

1264.72 --> 1271.6000000000001
i should have been nicer so i regret

1268.32 --> 1276.78
that i'm sorry police officers that came

1271.6 --> 1278.7199999999998
by yesterday

1276.78 --> 1283.2
[Music]

1278.72 --> 1287.6000000000001
never ever let the police in well

1283.2 --> 1290.799
look it's literally snowing outside

1287.6 --> 1294.24
you know

1290.799 --> 1297.28
but maybe i should have let them in

1294.24 --> 1301.6
like after a minute or so after

1297.28 --> 1304.08
just a few words it seemed kind of rude

1301.6 --> 1306.8799999999999
and i don't didn't mean to be rude i was

1304.08 --> 1306.8799999999999
just really

1307.44 --> 1312.0800000000002
in the car i was just trying to calm

1309.44 --> 1316.72
down from being

1312.08 --> 1316.72
pretty disappointed and pissed off

1316.84 --> 1319.84
so

1320.559 --> 1333.84
if i had a break-in i would let them

1323.6 --> 1333.84
yeah yeah

1339.28 --> 1344.08
to collect the body okay george sanford

1344.159 --> 1347.8400000000001
that's cute

1351.679 --> 1363.76
all right

1360.72 --> 1367.28
i just hope that the that

1363.76 --> 1368.72
there's some way that i that the police

1367.28 --> 1371.2
can figure out

1368.72 --> 1371.84
that people just keep calling the police

1371.2 --> 1374.559
on

1371.84 --> 1378.3999999999999
me here in this address for no damn

1374.559 --> 1380.6399999999999
reason i hope they figure it out

1378.4 --> 1380.64
right

1382.24 --> 1386.0
and then who knows maybe i can kind of

1384.08 --> 1386.8799999999999
become friends with some of them or

1386.0 --> 1389.84
something and hey

1386.88 --> 1392.159
there's a lot of them seemed like really

1389.84 --> 1396.1589999999999
good guys

1392.159 --> 1396.159
mostly had guys too to here so

1396.48 --> 1400.0
was there a female officer i don't know

1398.88 --> 1403.8400000000001
i think there was

1400.0 --> 1403.84
some point

1406.0 --> 1409.6
but yeah the police has been

1410.32 --> 1414.0
yeah exemplary they're really good

1413.28 --> 1417.84
people

1414.0 --> 1420.0
here that take their job very serious

1417.84 --> 1431.84
and they're not like trigger happy or

1420.0 --> 1431.84
that kind of thing

1433.28 --> 1437.46
[Music]

1440.0 --> 1445.84
right so that kind of was sitting on me

1443.36 --> 1445.84
for a bit

1446.33 --> 1452.72
[Music]

1449.36 --> 1454.6399999999999
unfortunately it did not get away and

1452.72 --> 1458.0
did not get in the way of me having a

1454.64 --> 1462.4
good night rest

1458.0 --> 1462.4
did get in my way of making notes though

1466.72 --> 1474.799
what have i been up to navy tex

1470.84 --> 1478.6399999999999
37 what i've been up to well

1474.799 --> 1478.6399999999999
not much really

1481.039 --> 1486.8799999999999
i've been thinking a bit about early

1483.279 --> 1487.6
bird i've been thinking about discord

1486.88 --> 1490.74
because

1487.6 --> 1490.74
[Music]

1491.12 --> 1500.3999999999999
i don't know i'm trying to

1495.12 --> 1502.2399999999998
grow what i do here and

1500.4 --> 1503.76
yeah it would really be good at some

1502.24 --> 1507.1200000000001
point if i could have

1503.76 --> 1509.679
people on maybe on a regular basis like

1507.12 --> 1510.32
through discord unfortunately discord

1509.679 --> 1512.0
for me

1510.32 --> 1514.72
is giving me a lot of hassle although

1512.0 --> 1517.76
last time can i get in 24 7

1514.72 --> 1521.2
yeah i did yesterday not for long though

1517.76 --> 1522.8799999999999
but the volume seemed restored

1521.2 --> 1524.88
so i didn't have the issue anymore it's

1522.88 --> 1528.24
just so weird

1524.88 --> 1530.5590000000002
randomly all that stuff happens

1528.24 --> 1530.559
anyway

1534.64 --> 1543.8400000000001
yeah yesterday's show was pretty decent

1554.84 --> 1560.6399999999999
um all right

1557.2 --> 1563.3600000000001
oh by the way i did kind of

1560.64 --> 1564.4
start out watching today watching owen

1563.36 --> 1568.32
benjamin so he

1564.4 --> 1573.039
is still doing streams at least was a

1568.32 --> 1573.039
short stream uploaded on bit shoot

1573.679 --> 1579.52
i do really miss being present in his

1575.919 --> 1579.5200000000002
live shows i'm wondering like

1579.679 --> 1584.0
maybe i should just join the instagram

1582.0 --> 1586.32
just to see if i can follow his live

1584.0 --> 1589.919
shows

1586.32 --> 1591.2
it's really tough to to get to the big

1589.919 --> 1594.0
bear these days

1591.2 --> 1594.0
on the internet

1596.84 --> 1603.84
uh

1599.84 --> 1605.84
after that oh yeah watch the matrix

1603.84 --> 1608.08
the matrix reloaded actually the second

1605.84 --> 1608.08
one

1611.44 --> 1616.3200000000002
i did realize like how big it how much

1617.2 --> 1623.279
how different like the second and the

1620.4 --> 1626.72
third i haven't seen that one yet

1623.279 --> 1627.76
or at least watching right now but how

1626.72 --> 1632.08
different

1627.76 --> 1632.08
that movie really is from the first one

1632.4 --> 1641.8400000000001
so much more action and

1645.52 --> 1652.1589999999999
like the the plot is less

1648.88 --> 1654.0
less interesting in a way

1652.159 --> 1655.44
it's still part of the bigger story

1654.0 --> 1658.48
though it's just

1655.44 --> 1659.3600000000001
i know it's just a different movie i

1658.48 --> 1661.84
still think it's

1659.36 --> 1663.76
it's pretty cool and it's very focused

1661.84 --> 1666.84
just on the mechanics of the world so

1663.76 --> 1669.2
it's much more like a world

1666.84 --> 1671.76
building set of movies

1669.2 --> 1673.039
the second and third then the first one

1671.76 --> 1675.2
first one is more like

1673.039 --> 1676.08
completely universal conceptual

1675.2 --> 1679.1200000000001
background

1676.08 --> 1683.4399999999998
plot and just the

1679.12 --> 1685.36
the awakening process within it and

1683.44 --> 1688.559
and the second and third are much more

1685.36 --> 1688.559
just world building

1689.84 --> 1697.84
of the matrix anyway did that uh

1698.08 --> 1702.399
watched a bit of this bit bit of that i

1700.72 --> 1705.52
think i watched

1702.399 --> 1708.08
jaron or well rather

1705.52 --> 1710.0
glow busters but it was just on jiren's

1708.08 --> 1712.799
channel a bit

1710.0 --> 1712.799
not elaborate

1721.76 --> 1725.84
what else

1732.72 --> 1739.84
let's see

1740.32 --> 1744.8799999999999
all right i see now bible literally was

1742.64 --> 1745.5200000000002
also also alive but i completely missed

1744.88 --> 1748.159
it

1745.52 --> 1748.1589999999999
fortunately

1749.44 --> 1753.2
i think i was watching a flat earth

1751.919 --> 1758.7990000000002
debate

1753.2 --> 1758.799
from friday it's a really long one

1761.84 --> 1767.84
all right so that's it

1771.6 --> 1775.039
apparently the matrix is about

1773.52 --> 1781.84
transgender issues

1775.039 --> 1781.84
really is it is it

1794.85 --> 1799.6789999999999
[Music]

1796.399 --> 1801.12
hey robert 96 the rmp

1799.679 --> 1803.1200000000001
there are a lot more people in

1801.12 --> 1804.399
government and many other sectors of

1803.12 --> 1808.8799999999999
society that know

1804.399 --> 1810.7199999999998
earth is flat then ball trolls even know

1808.88 --> 1813.2
apparently ballers are always the last

1810.72 --> 1823.84
to get the memo

1813.2 --> 1823.8400000000001
i bet you're right

1825.76 --> 1829.2
because it's been out there for a while

1827.919 --> 1832.3990000000001
and people

1829.2 --> 1836.559
well if people get if there's just a lot

1832.399 --> 1838.799
of people getting into conspiracies then

1836.559 --> 1840.1589999999999
like really getting into it then they

1838.799 --> 1843.9189999999999
would have have to been

1840.159 --> 1845.3600000000001
confronted with flatter somehow some way

1843.919 --> 1847.279
at some point just because of the

1845.36 --> 1850.08
information digging

1847.279 --> 1850.48
and then there's the people that don't

1850.08 --> 1852.48
do

1850.48 --> 1854.64
things with it actively and just look

1852.48 --> 1856.799
into it and they too

1854.64 --> 1857.76
don't even know how big that part is

1856.799 --> 1860.08
they too

1857.76 --> 1865.84
by now would have have to have bumped

1860.08 --> 1865.84
into flat earth somehow at some point

1866.159 --> 1879.8400000000001
yes i know unfortunate reality

1869.76 --> 1879.84
yeah i'm not look i don't really care

1882.48 --> 1886.08
hence the movie right

1889.039 --> 1895.279
what it's legit i was also initially

1892.64 --> 1895.279
shocked what

1895.679 --> 1898.24
what why

1900.64 --> 1907.8400000000001
did it's just

1910.08 --> 1916.1589999999999
look i'm just looking at the movie okay

1914.399 --> 1918.32
and i like the movie and i like the

1916.159 --> 1922.3200000000002
style i like the style they gave it

1918.32 --> 1924.6399999999999
a lot right does that mean that because

1922.32 --> 1927.9189999999999
they themselves

1924.64 --> 1930.3200000000002
are transgender now and

1927.919 --> 1932.0800000000002
i don't know had they ever have they had

1930.32 --> 1932.72
operation i don't even know this [ __ ]

1932.08 --> 1935.9189999999999
because i

1932.72 --> 1937.44
it's not i don't care it's they want to

1935.919 --> 1941.1200000000001
do that

1937.44 --> 1943.919
they want to draw in that crowd fine

1941.12 --> 1945.84
they do that i'm not part of that

1943.919 --> 1949.2
because i'm not into that sort of thing

1945.84 --> 1949.519
at all but i am into the matrix i really

1949.2 --> 1952.72
am

1949.519 --> 1953.76
into what they made whatever that's

1952.72 --> 1956.88
supposed to be

1953.76 --> 1959.6
hiding or expressing from a transgender

1956.88 --> 1959.6000000000001
perspective

1960.32 --> 1967.039
i think it touches on much bigger issues

1963.44 --> 1967.039
than that you know

1974.48 --> 1991.84
mr europe spoke out about adrenal growth

1991.919 --> 1994.24
yo

2002.0 --> 2019.84
dude why are you bringing that up

2005.6 --> 2019.84
what has that got to do with anything

2026.02 --> 2029.4
[Music]

2044.84 --> 2052.0299999999997
uh

2047.24 --> 2052.03
[Music]

2055.56 --> 2061.839
testosterone is synthesized is it i

2058.639 --> 2061.839
don't know maybe

2069.359 --> 2075.839
i think these days a lot of things can

2072.159 --> 2075.839
be synthesized

2084.96 --> 2088.539
[Music]

2097.15 --> 2100.329
[Music]

2100.839 --> 2103.839
anyway

2118.8 --> 2125.28
so guys what would you like me to

2122.32 --> 2125.28
talk about

2126.56 --> 2136.32
palmer hmm

2131.839 --> 2140.88
yeah robert 1960 rmp uh-huh

2136.32 --> 2140.88
the name is sounds vaguely familiar

2142.88 --> 2159.839
i don't think i've watched it though i

2145.28 --> 2159.8390000000004
think i heard of that movie in the past

2170.839 --> 2173.839
wow

2180.16 --> 2187.839
it to me it's just all dianetics

2184.839 --> 2187.839
what

2199.68 --> 2202.7999999999997
oh god really

2204.24 --> 2215.839
oh well in that case i don't really care

2216.24 --> 2220.8799999999997
they're really pushing it yeah yeah i

2218.079 --> 2229.8390000000004
know that's probably gonna get worse

2220.88 --> 2229.839
it's just that if you

2237.359 --> 2245.119
again i think should be safe to say just

2241.52 --> 2245.119
don't let your children watch it

2248.0 --> 2257.839
and i don't know

2261.839 --> 2264.7999999999997
i'm just trying

2268.839 --> 2271.839
hmm

2273.839 --> 2277.04
like there's a lot of ugly things out

2275.76 --> 2280.0
there in the world i don't really know

2277.04 --> 2280.0
what to do about it

2282.839 --> 2285.839
okay

2289.68 --> 2297.04
dimensional convergence is upon us

2292.88 --> 2299.839
okay chris la jambe

2297.04 --> 2299.839
what does that mean

2308.84 --> 2312.2290000000003
[Music]

2338.079 --> 2356.96
give homophobes a heads up okay thanks

2354.32 --> 2358.56
oh look if i'd bump into that movie for

2356.96 --> 2360.8
some reason by accident

2358.56 --> 2362.64
i wouldn't really like get triggered

2360.8 --> 2366.1600000000003
over that or anything

2362.64 --> 2368.56
it's like i just like

2366.16 --> 2369.7599999999998
lose interest and just don't want to

2368.56 --> 2373.52
watch it anymore

2369.76 --> 2376.7200000000003
if it's like well too gay

2373.52 --> 2378.56
that's all and they there's plenty out

2376.72 --> 2379.359
there if i'm going to get triggered over

2378.56 --> 2383.839
all that

2379.359 --> 2383.839
it's just to no end

2384.079 --> 2387.6800000000003
so avoidance has kind of been my policy

2386.56 --> 2391.2799999999997
with it

2387.68 --> 2391.2799999999997
because nobody will care

2391.839 --> 2397.839
not out here anyway like literally

2394.839 --> 2397.839
nobody

2402.15 --> 2409.04
[Music]

2405.28 --> 2409.0400000000004
kind of a weird questions is that

2409.119 --> 2411.839
dr gonzo

2430.48 --> 2439.839
why wouldn't they be

2443.76 --> 2447.2000000000003
want to see a good movie

2450.16 --> 2455.1189999999997
okay i'll look that up i what is it

2464.839 --> 2467.839
about

2478.839 --> 2481.839
oh

2487.599 --> 2493.52
that sounds like a world war two thing

2493.599 --> 2497.6800000000003
or that's what it looks like when i

2495.119 --> 2497.6800000000003
looked it up

2506.079 --> 2509.92
like the swastikas the first thing that

2508.24 --> 2513.4399999999996
popped up

2509.92 --> 2513.44
when i did that thanks

2518.0 --> 2523.839
ah girl says these stones to the nazis

2521.359 --> 2523.839
okay

2544.73 --> 2547.869
[Music]

2548.839 --> 2551.839
uh

2558.53 --> 2561.659
[Music]

2576.839 --> 2579.839
right

2585.2 --> 2590.839
okay well thank you for the the short

2588.0 --> 2593.839
review of that robert

2590.839 --> 2593.839
rmp

2605.17 --> 2608.84
[Music]

2611.79 --> 2621.489
[Music]

2646.839 --> 2649.839
so

2655.76 --> 2662.079
so is there anything else you guys want

2657.599 --> 2664.2400000000002
to talk about

2662.079 --> 2665.92
is not the kind of subject i really want

2664.24 --> 2670.7999999999997
to talk about

2665.92 --> 2670.8
on the 800th episode if you know what i

2674.839 --> 2677.839
mean

2678.72 --> 2692.8799999999997
like what can i say about it

2690.64 --> 2705.839
like i think i've been pretty clear on

2692.88 --> 2705.839
like what my stance is

2706.0 --> 2709.359
i'm thinking for a topping not much

2708.4 --> 2719.839
comes to my yeah

2709.359 --> 2719.839
for me the same

2730.48 --> 2734.64
there's just a lot happening things

2732.4 --> 2747.839
being

2734.64 --> 2747.839
pushed here in the netherlands as well

2753.52 --> 2761.839
all right apparently there was this bbc

2757.04 --> 2761.839
interview with our prime minister

2762.96 --> 2766.7200000000003
about conspiracy theorists

2768.8 --> 2777.44
so if you guys wanna do

2773.76 --> 2777.44
i haven't fully watched it though

2778.48 --> 2781.359
let's see is it

2783.119 --> 2789.839
with english subtitles

2800.839 --> 2803.839
ah

2805.2 --> 2817.839
ah come on

2826.39 --> 2831.839
[Music]

2828.839 --> 2831.839
it

2871.2 --> 2875.7599999999998
you would like to hear my viewpoint

2873.68 --> 2878.16
regarding the supposed ice wall well

2875.76 --> 2880.96
what about it

2878.16 --> 2882.96
dr gonzo thank you for actually bringing

2880.96 --> 2885.76
some kind of flat earth

2882.96 --> 2888.7200000000003
related question ice wall i guess with

2885.76 --> 2888.7200000000003
the snow around

2889.599 --> 2892.559
that would come to mind

2893.119 --> 2900.079
right so i don't know about a

2896.96 --> 2902.96
ice wall as in

2900.079 --> 2904.319
like a persistent ice wall that would

2902.96 --> 2908.2400000000002
perfectly surround

2904.319 --> 2911.119
everything our realm in circular fashion

2908.24 --> 2912.8799999999997
right i don't know about that but there

2911.119 --> 2915.28
might be a

2912.88 --> 2917.119
segment where there is like a big ice

2915.28 --> 2919.44
wall

2917.119 --> 2922.1600000000003
if it is anywhere it's going to be at

2919.44 --> 2922.16
the south end

2924.24 --> 2930.5589999999997
and i don't know if that is like the end

2928.16 --> 2932.16
of the realm and that there's a barrier

2930.559 --> 2934.8
behind

2932.16 --> 2935.2799999999997
or that it's just really really cold up

2934.8 --> 2937.28
there and

2935.28 --> 2938.48
always has been and that's why there's a

2937.28 --> 2942.079
huge ice wall

2938.48 --> 2943.76
that that has grown

2942.079 --> 2945.76
maybe there is something beyond i don't

2943.76 --> 2948.0
know

2945.76 --> 2950.0
maybe the ice wall is not as persistent

2948.0 --> 2952.16
everywhere

2950.0 --> 2953.2
because it doesn't need to be because

2952.16 --> 2955.92
it's not a

2953.2 --> 2957.68
container preventing the oceans from

2955.92 --> 2961.839
falling off the flatter disk or

2957.68 --> 2965.2
something nonsensical like that right

2961.839 --> 2969.2
there is a there have been big ice walls

2965.2 --> 2969.5989999999997
sided though there's ice walls somewhere

2969.2 --> 2972.3999999999996
or

2969.599 --> 2972.88
there used to be at least i don't see

2972.4 --> 2976.1600000000003
them

2972.88 --> 2985.839
just going away very quickly so they're

2976.16 --> 2985.839
probably still there

2994.0 --> 2998.48
no no i don't have an idea what's

2997.2 --> 3000.72
outside of the ice hole

2998.48 --> 3004.4
it could just be another land segment

3000.72 --> 3004.3999999999996
depends on the nature of the realm

3004.88 --> 3012.2400000000002
like what it is we are in

3008.48 --> 3015.92
it could be a barrier it could be

3012.24 --> 3015.9199999999996
another realm segment

3020.319 --> 3025.44
i don't know maybe there's a

3023.839 --> 3027.2
little realm in the middle of like an

3025.44 --> 3029.28
ice ice

3027.2 --> 3031.1189999999997
surrounded by ice maybe there's a little

3029.28 --> 3034.48
realm there i don't know

3031.119 --> 3041.839
all kinds of things could be there

3034.48 --> 3041.839
i don't know

3044.98 --> 3048.26
[Music]

3068.0 --> 3074.48
and look up the name admiral bird

3071.04 --> 3077.119
maybe well he certainly

3074.48 --> 3078.319
filled in some things now whether that

3077.119 --> 3083.839
is completely true

3078.319 --> 3083.839
is another matter

3087.68 --> 3091.359
but at least there is the suggestion out

3090.16 --> 3093.839
there

3091.359 --> 3097.52
that there is something more like he's

3093.839 --> 3100.64
kind of the first one to on camera

3097.52 --> 3102.0
put that out that suggestion that there

3100.64 --> 3104.96
is more

3102.0 --> 3108.72
right we don't know if there is though

3104.96 --> 3111.359
he could literally have made it up

3108.72 --> 3112.7999999999997
not just randomly but as part of some

3111.359 --> 3117.839
project or whatever

3112.8 --> 3117.8390000000004
something psychological don't

3122.839 --> 3125.839
know

3248.559 --> 3251.8390000000004
the way

3253.28 --> 3256.8
basically like help

3257.44 --> 3262.16
help me with my nerves it's not the best

3259.76 --> 3265.2000000000003
person to call for that

3262.16 --> 3268.319
but yeah seriously my phone yeah

3265.2 --> 3270.96
the craziness was that i turned off my

3268.319 --> 3272.88
phone and then i couldn't get it on

3270.96 --> 3274.48
and then when i uh because you have to

3272.88 --> 3277.04
have a special code and i

3274.48 --> 3278.4
couldn't remember i was too nervous at

3277.04 --> 3279.92
the time

3278.4 --> 3281.599
then it went to the website where you

3279.92 --> 3284.16
normally retrieve that

3281.599 --> 3286.079
and the website was down so i couldn't

3284.16 --> 3290.64
turn on my phone anymore

3286.079 --> 3293.76
it's like yeah cascade of just

3290.64 --> 3296.0789999999997
chaotic things

3293.76 --> 3296.079
right

3299.68 --> 3303.359
i even forgot to share that part that

3301.68 --> 3304.16
that happened to anyway but i skype

3303.359 --> 3307.7599999999998
called him and

3304.16 --> 3310.24
started out a bit unpleasant

3307.76 --> 3311.76
not like loud just like i didn't feel

3310.24 --> 3315.9199999999996
very good

3311.76 --> 3318.7990000000004
but eventually that yeah

3315.92 --> 3320.7200000000003
felt a lot better and just getting some

3318.799 --> 3323.7599999999998
input from them

3320.72 --> 3324.5589999999997
they themselves also it's remarkable to

3323.76 --> 3327.599
see that they

3324.559 --> 3330.88
deal with nerve situations too

3327.599 --> 3334.559
and like they even described some

3330.88 --> 3338.4
it was just shocking to me like what

3334.559 --> 3348.0
but how how do you keep it under control

3338.4 --> 3351.359
so well i don't understand

3348.0 --> 3351.839
then again they are a lot older i am

3351.359 --> 3354.0
already

3351.839 --> 3355.359
a lot better at controlling myself than

3354.0 --> 3358.319
it was say

3355.359 --> 3358.319
20 years ago

3359.44 --> 3363.839
so it should grow better with age

3365.44 --> 3377.839
the more age the less rage hopefully

3388.839 --> 3391.839
right

3398.65 --> 3401.7690000000002
[Music]

3417.2 --> 3423.839
right well

3420.48 --> 3426.16
look considering that admiral bird was a

3423.839 --> 3428.64
freemason

3426.16 --> 3430.8799999999997
you could see it as something really

3428.64 --> 3433.52
complicated right

3430.88 --> 3434.7200000000003
potentially like what if admiral byrd

3433.52 --> 3437.44
was doing that

3434.72 --> 3438.5589999999997
thing saying about the other realm as it

3437.44 --> 3443.839
were

3438.559 --> 3443.8390000000004
as like a secondary option

3444.48 --> 3449.2
say that they were already in the know

3447.52 --> 3452.0
that there was going to be some kind of

3449.2 --> 3456.72
a moon landing thing

3452.0 --> 3459.76
happening in the future and they had to

3456.72 --> 3462.319
or they planned to put this out there

3459.76 --> 3464.6400000000003
as an alternative for if that all went

3462.319 --> 3467.7599999999998
completely wrong and nobody would buy it

3464.64 --> 3470.8799999999997
they were unable to achieve

3467.76 --> 3472.559
that spell perfectly right so that they

3470.88 --> 3477.359
had something to fall back

3472.559 --> 3481.2000000000003
on to to get people's attention

3477.359 --> 3483.52
right so maybe that's why he put that

3481.2 --> 3485.68
out there

3483.52 --> 3488.079
like as a stunt it could be seen as

3485.68 --> 3491.04
gimmicky whatever it could be ignored

3488.079 --> 3492.559
but if [ __ ] gets real then it could be

3491.04 --> 3496.319
pull out of the drawer and

3492.559 --> 3500.3190000000004
use to engage in a new project right

3496.319 --> 3503.839
something like that i don't know i'm

3500.319 --> 3506.16
i'm just speculating about it

3503.839 --> 3507.599
as you say he was a freemason after all

3506.16 --> 3512.16
and they

3507.599 --> 3515.119
do know about the backdrop plans

3512.16 --> 3517.839
mistakes that unfold they learn about

3515.119 --> 3517.839
that

3542.839 --> 3559.839
so

3545.119 --> 3559.839
what i don't know what that means a gym

3563.72 --> 3566.72
1864

3570.839 --> 3573.839
what

3581.839 --> 3587.839
what do you mean robert

3614.64 --> 3621.2
the i 1860 what is that i don't know

3617.839 --> 3621.2
what you're talking about robert

3626.839 --> 3629.839
rmp

3634.4 --> 3637.92
oh wait you're you're addressing that

3637.599 --> 3643.839
guy

3637.92 --> 3643.839
never mind

3650.64 --> 3656.96
yeah there's a lot of dates

3653.68 --> 3671.839
in people's names these days

3656.96 --> 3671.839
in my chat

3685.599 --> 3692.88
right but i hope i did address

3688.799 --> 3695.44
like the reason why right robert

3692.88 --> 3696.88
i did just talk about that for a bit

3695.44 --> 3699.68
about what it could have been

3696.88 --> 3701.6800000000003
like a an alternative backdrop for if

3699.68 --> 3704.0789999999997
things go wrong

3701.68 --> 3706.24
just kind of like a way to keep options

3704.079 --> 3710.1600000000003
open

3706.24 --> 3712.4799999999996
could what admiral bird said

3710.16 --> 3713.2
be considered to be something like that

3712.48 --> 3727.839
perhaps

3713.2 --> 3727.839
does that make more sense

3746.48 --> 3755.839
what the biblical perspective of effie

3750.799 --> 3755.839
what does that mean

3772.4 --> 3776.48
four pillars and not moving well it's

3774.88 --> 3779.2000000000003
not moving

3776.48 --> 3779.2
that's for sure

3780.0 --> 3783.68
although yeah the four pillars still

3781.839 --> 3784.88
it's still a bit of a mystery what that

3783.68 --> 3787.0389999999998
really is

3784.88 --> 3790.7200000000003
you know i've yet to see any sort of

3787.039 --> 3793.599
confirmation or indication of that

3790.72 --> 3797.52
now i have theorized about pillars on

3793.599 --> 3800.7200000000003
the earth to uphold the sky as it were

3797.52 --> 3802.559
and yeah even theorized in a looping

3800.72 --> 3805.5989999999997
situation

3802.559 --> 3807.599
that it yeah if the earth rests on

3805.599 --> 3810.4
pillars then maybe those pillars

3807.599 --> 3811.92
rests on earth somewhere right something

3810.4 --> 3813.76
like that so

3811.92 --> 3815.44
i don't know about the pillars never see

3813.76 --> 3817.44
them

3815.44 --> 3825.839
but i have theorized about them in a

3817.44 --> 3825.839
cosmogeny setup

3829.05 --> 3832.239
[Music]

3858.72 --> 3863.2799999999997
so the pillars must be attached to the

3860.799 --> 3866.0
dome well

3863.28 --> 3866.88
if the dome was a literal geometrical

3866.0 --> 3869.52
dome

3866.88 --> 3873.2000000000003
then no it would have a touchdown point

3869.52 --> 3876.48
but if it was a flat top-like ceiling

3873.2 --> 3881.839
then perhaps pillars do touch

3876.48 --> 3881.839
that to keep it up like a table

3883.52 --> 3888.16
or maybe it is even a singular pillar

3889.44 --> 3895.839
i don't know might be for

3904.34 --> 3909.839
[Music]

3906.839 --> 3909.839
so

3911.49 --> 3924.4089999999997

[Music]

3938.1 --> 3941.199
[Music]

3945.839 --> 3951.839
any theories on how large the dome is

3957.2 --> 3964.3999999999996
i don't know there might be some

3961.359 --> 3965.2
people out there that have puzzled it

3964.4 --> 3968.2400000000002
out

3965.2 --> 3969.9199999999996
what they think the the dome might be

3968.24 --> 3971.4399999999996
when they presuppose the earth is a

3969.92 --> 3974.88
literal disc with the dome

3971.44 --> 3977.599
on top of it they might have

3974.88 --> 3980.48
yeah tried to figure out the geometry of

3977.599 --> 3980.48
that i don't know

3984.079 --> 3993.8390000000004
ganzo is a long-term troll

3987.68 --> 3993.839
is he

4002.8 --> 4005.8590000000004
[Music]

4018.839 --> 4021.839
um

4024.4 --> 4035.839
those rufus and tubbins

4042.4 --> 4046.88
yeah yeah the i i kind of have to agree

4045.2 --> 4049.2799999999997
with dr gonzo

4046.88 --> 4051.28
about this he is asking questions at

4049.28 --> 4054.1600000000003
least

4051.28 --> 4054.559
and yeah even a bit of it if there is

4054.16 --> 4057.5989999999997
some

4054.559 --> 4063.599
trick question angle to it

4057.599 --> 4066.96
doesn't mean that it can't be asked

4063.599 --> 4066.96
like i still have an answer

4073.28 --> 4077.8390000000004
yes tiny wombo yeah

4088.4 --> 4105.839
film that might be about transgender

4091.039 --> 4105.839
yeah i don't see that though

4116.839 --> 4119.839
so

4144.839 --> 4161.59
hmm

4146.56 --> 4165.619000000001
oh sheesh

4161.59 --> 4165.619000000001
[Music]

4171.12 --> 4178.489
long term trolls cave trolls

4175.39 --> 4178.4890000000005
[Music]

4190.64 --> 4195.759
a long-term troll would that be a

4192.799 --> 4195.759
crawler troll

4197.28 --> 4205.28
or a digger yay

4202.4 --> 4206.879999999999
classifications of trolls now i don't

4205.28 --> 4210.8
know i don't think that

4206.88 --> 4217.84
dr gonzo is really that bad of a troll

4210.8 --> 4217.84
or at least not today

4249.28 --> 4253.759999999999
right well great thanks for bringing

4251.679 --> 4259.52
that back up

4253.76 --> 4273.84
but again just because they say that

4259.52 --> 4273.84
you know

4299.84 --> 4304.400000000001
what that [ __ ] what where are you

4301.6 --> 4304.400000000001
getting that from

4309.199 --> 4329.839999999999
is there gonna be a new matrix movie

4314.4 --> 4329.839999999999
i've heard rumors

4329.92 --> 4343.4400000000005
hmm okay well we'll see what it's gonna

4333.28 --> 4347.92
be like

4343.44 --> 4347.919999999999
four five and six oh my god

4354.84 --> 4357.84
oh

4361.04 --> 4367.679
well if they're gonna ruin it

4364.56 --> 4371.360000000001
then yeah they're gonna ruin it

4367.679 --> 4372.96
i don't know i just know that i really

4371.36 --> 4375.199
like the first one

4372.96 --> 4376.8
mostly and the second and third one i

4375.199 --> 4385.839999999999
thought was pretty cool too

4376.8 --> 4385.84
you know and

4393.6 --> 4398.64
30 23rd december hmm

4396.96 --> 4401.04
all right well we'll see we'll see what

4398.64 --> 4401.04
happens

4401.53 --> 4404.71
[Music]

4410.96 --> 4416.2390000000005
very funny no steamy traveler

4414.4 --> 4419.36
not gonna be the new neo if anything i'm

4416.239 --> 4419.36
gonna be the oracle

4420.4 --> 4429.679
you know this be true yeah

4427.84 --> 4441.84
no i don't think i have the the right

4429.679 --> 4441.84
stature for it

4447.199 --> 4451.599999999999
also i don't think i'm really fit enough

4449.679 --> 4453.76
to do any of it you know there was a

4451.6 --> 4456.56
there is especially with the matrix is

4453.76 --> 4459.679
there is a lot of

4456.56 --> 4462.64
well physical action going on

4459.679 --> 4464.719
i don't think i can yeah i've never had

4462.64 --> 4465.679
like super extensive training or

4464.719 --> 4468.8
anything

4465.679 --> 4471.36
not updating it so i don't think i can

4468.8 --> 4472.08
do that unless i had like a really long

4471.36 --> 4475.599999999999
time to

4472.08 --> 4478.64
build up to that

4475.6 --> 4481.6
then then maybe i could actually i

4478.64 --> 4482.4800000000005
have had taekwondo for a pretty decent

4481.6 --> 4485.120000000001
time

4482.48 --> 4485.12
in my past

4487.04 --> 4499.6
oh god here we go again

4496.159 --> 4499.599999999999
of the caribbean are

4508.239 --> 4525.57
is neo going to make the jump this first

4511.28 --> 4528.719999999999
time that's hilarious

4525.57 --> 4528.719999999999
[Music]

4544.48 --> 4546.879999999999
what

4548.56 --> 4557.4400000000005
really i did what i

4552.0 --> 4557.44
where where did where's that

4557.679 --> 4567.84
i hadn't even seen that that's crazy

4575.84 --> 4581.84
anyway i'll be back two minutes

4648.84 --> 4651.84
so

4691.679 --> 4695.4400000000005
okay i'll look him up

4695.6 --> 4707.84
oh god

4709.53 --> 4712.66
[Music]

4716.719 --> 4723.84
hmm okay

4720.8 --> 4723.84
a little i guess

4725.12 --> 4728.48
i look that much like him

4733.36 --> 4737.12
think he has better hair than me though

4742.239 --> 4749.839999999999
and he has a beard

4762.64 --> 4767.320000000001
phone booths are disappearing it's

4764.56 --> 4772.9890000000005
getting harder to leave the matrix

4767.32 --> 4772.989
[Music]

4774.84 --> 4780.02
okay

4776.92 --> 4780.02
[Music]

4784.86 --> 4790.139999999999
[Music]

4796.53 --> 4799.88
[Music]

4815.28 --> 4833.84
no more flip phones in the matrix

4819.44 --> 4833.839999999999
yeah too bad

4838.4 --> 4843.199
right but it also is going to depend on

4844.8 --> 4849.76
like the story progression right so

4846.96 --> 4853.28
after the matrix three

4849.76 --> 4853.280000000001
the entire thing resets

4853.92 --> 4859.1990000000005
even get to see that but like what is it

4856.88 --> 4859.6
resetting into like does that mean that

4859.199 --> 4863.839999999999
time

4859.6 --> 4863.84
is now progressing like they're

4864.08 --> 4868.239
gonna move to the next era or how does

4866.639 --> 4870.0
it really change you know so it all

4868.239 --> 4872.638999999999
depends on the vantage point of

4870.0 --> 4872.639
the setting

4873.199 --> 4876.719
what they're gonna do with it with the

4874.8 --> 4878.88
fourth movie where is it

4876.719 --> 4881.44
is it like in the future has time been

4878.88 --> 4884.96

create

4941.28 --> 4945.84
in creation

4945.92 --> 4951.92
like there is no other way it's like not

4949.12 --> 4951.92
even believing

4952.48 --> 4959.04
it would have to be created

4956.0 --> 4963.44
also where is information coming from

4959.04 --> 4967.28
how did that start all that so yes

4963.44 --> 4967.28
technically i do believe in a godly

4970.84 --> 4973.84
creator

4979.36 --> 5001.839999999999

5023.92 --> 5034.719
ideas are virtual structures

5029.84 --> 5034.719
right where's that coming from

5034.8 --> 5043.84
why do people get the same ideas

5048.239 --> 5052.5599999999995
anyway it's it's mostly a physics

5050.88 --> 5055.6
related conclusion

5052.56 --> 5057.1990000000005
through physics i conclude there has to

5055.6 --> 5061.1990000000005
be a creator that's

5057.199 --> 5063.599999999999
really where i rested on now beyond that

5061.199 --> 5063.599999999999
point

5065.28 --> 5074.4
i am still very

5071.679 --> 5076.8
i try to not draw any conclusions i try

5074.4 --> 5078.96
to draw less and less conclusions

5076.8 --> 5081.84
about beyond that i basically am

5078.96 --> 5086.56
modeling out the possibilities in my own

5081.84 --> 5090.2390000000005
way as i am the cosmogeny

5086.56 --> 5093.280000000001
of the realm it's always about what is

5090.239 --> 5095.12
based on what which we don't yet know

5093.28 --> 5096.5599999999995
and then branch out a tree of

5095.12 --> 5100.719
possibilities and so

5096.56 --> 5103.84
do i with with what god is

5100.719 --> 5105.4800000000005
and there's all kinds of perspectives

5103.84 --> 5106.88
and i basically uphold them

5105.48 --> 5109.919999999999
simultaneously

5106.88 --> 5112.719
for myself and then

5109.92 --> 5115.04
progress my research on trying to figure

5112.719 --> 5115.04
it out

5116.48 --> 5121.678999999999
by reflecting it all on the world and my

5119.44 --> 5126.089999999999

5121.679 --> 5129.34
and my insights

5126.09 --> 5129.34
[Music]

5162.0 --> 5167.44
right dutch sailor free will is real

5165.52 --> 5169.84
but it could also be considered a matter

5167.44 --> 5169.839999999999
of perspective

5171.199 --> 5174.719
isn't free will always going to be just

5173.679 --> 5177.04
making the best

5174.719 --> 5177.04
choice

5178.719 --> 5186.639
or trying to

5183.6 --> 5188.56
or basically

5186.639 --> 5191.04
letting yourself be overwhelmed by

5188.56 --> 5191.04
things that

5191.679 --> 5196.32
that make you believe you don't you have

5194.88 --> 5200.08
to do something else so

5196.32 --> 5210.4
free will yes but it is really

5200.08 --> 5211.92
subjective like that in my opinion

5210.4 --> 5213.599999999999
right could you have made a different

5211.92 --> 5217.04
choice exactly

5213.6 --> 5219.120000000001
exactly because just because you change

5217.04 --> 5221.28
your mind and feelings doesn't mean that

5219.12 --> 5221.28
you

5222.48 --> 5227.12
can just justly imprint whatever you

5226.639 --> 5230.0
have

5227.12 --> 5231.92
then in your in that moment onto the a

5230.0 --> 5235.36
another moment where you didn't

5231.92 --> 5237.1990000000005
have that available and then judge it

5235.36 --> 5239.28
like i should have done this should have

5237.199 --> 5241.36
done that well maybe you just couldn't

5239.28 --> 5243.44
because you didn't have the things

5241.36 --> 5246.239
available that you would need

5243.44 --> 5247.04
to do that you would need to be able to

5246.239 --> 5251.199
do that

5247.04 --> 5254.639
right so

5251.199 --> 5256.4
by that standard like do we really have

5254.639 --> 5259.76
free will well we have a free will

5256.4 --> 5259.759999999999
to decide on

5261.04 --> 5267.84
what choices you're going to be forced

[Music]

5306.0 --> 5311.04
if you could have made a different

5307.6 --> 5314.88
choice does that exclude free will

5311.04 --> 5314.88
what no

5319.36 --> 5337.839999999999
i said already explained it's a matter

5321.679 --> 5337.84
of perspective

5376.84 --> 5382.4800000000005

5378.08 --> 5382.48

5404.84 --> 5421.84

what are you talking about dr gonzo

5427.52 --> 5435.1990000000005
that makes no sense if there is a god

5429.44 --> 5437.678999999999
then there would be no free will why

5435.199 --> 5440.239
what is free will could you be more

5437.679 --> 5445.28
specific

5440.239 --> 5445.28
i tried to lay out some things about it

5446.84 --> 5449.84
right

5455.12 --> 5460.32
everything would have been determined

5456.8 --> 5460.320000000001
according from god's plan

5460.84 --> 5465.4400000000005
well yeah

5465.679 --> 5472.0
but god's plan actually

5468.719 --> 5474.32
as far as i understand and from other

5472.0 --> 5478.32
people's reflections on it

5474.32 --> 5491.84
god's will takes free will into account

5478.32 --> 5491.84
god's plan that is sorry

5494.32 --> 5498.799999999999
does god know what choices we will make

5502.84 --> 5505.84
yes

5514.4 --> 5518.96
what just because he knows it you don't

5517.679 --> 5520.4800000000005
have free will anymore

5518.96 --> 5524.159
you know what you're gonna choose does

5520.48 --> 5526.32
that take the free will from you

5524.159 --> 5526.32
no

5528.56 --> 5533.84
i don't understand

5538.06 --> 5541.179
[Music]

5542.96 --> 5549.36
no but just

5546.4 --> 5549.36
this is ridiculous

5549.6 --> 5553.6
if he knows which choices we will make

5551.92 --> 5557.1990000000005
doesn't that exclude free will

5553.6 --> 5557.92
no you don't seem to understand what

5557.199 --> 5561.678999999999
free will

5557.92 --> 5566.2390000000005
is is the it's

5561.679 --> 5567.6
freedom of choice

5566.239 --> 5569.199
what you're going to do how you're going

5567.6 --> 5570.0
to respond if you're going to continue

5569.199 --> 5572.32
going to give up

5570.0 --> 5573.6
going to find an alternative but all

5572.32 --> 5576.639
that can be

5573.6 --> 5579.360000000001
just fractally downsized and then taken

5576.639 --> 5583.679
into account

5579.36 --> 5587.92
by the creator who lives outside of time

5583.679 --> 5603.84
so he can see it he knows how it works

5587.92 --> 5603.84
he designed it

5605.85 --> 5609.899
[Music]

5614.84 --> 5617.84
so

5622.8 --> 5627.1990000000005
if god knows her actions beforehand it

5625.04 --> 5631.84
must already be determined

5627.199 --> 5631.839999999999
well yeah

5636.0 --> 5640.159
that doesn't mean you don't have free

5637.6 --> 5643.360000000001
will though it's just that

5640.159 --> 5645.679
the free will will buy what you are and

5643.36 --> 5649.679
how you work and

5645.679 --> 5651.36
will make you make these choices

5649.679 --> 5659.84
you will choose from what you see

5651.36 --> 5659.839999999999
available to you

5670.84 --> 5673.84
so

5677.28 --> 5681.599999999999
aries 106 hey oh they're finally a good

5680.08 --> 5684.5599999999995
question about this

5681.6 --> 5686.0
right if i build a robot that does what

5684.56 --> 5687.6
i program it to do and i

5686.0 --> 5690.48
programmed the robot to believe it has

5687.6 --> 5701.84
free will does my robot has free will

5690.48 --> 5701.839999999999
well from their perspective they will

5707.84 --> 5715.28
yeah one one could potentially argue you

5710.56 --> 5720.400000000001
have free will if you believe in it

5715.28 --> 5720.4
but look it's technical like that

5720.88 --> 5726.639
just because god has grip on some

5724.08 --> 5728.719
timeless situation about things and that

5726.639 --> 5729.6
and yes that changes everything well

5728.719 --> 5733.119
guess what

5729.6 --> 5734.0
you're not you're still bound by the

5733.119 --> 5736.48
physical

5734.0 --> 5738.32
timeline and all that so you're just

5736.48 --> 5740.799999999999
going to have to deal with things

5738.32 --> 5742.799999999999
from that perspective so it doesn't

5740.8 --> 5744.2390000000005
matter if god knows everything you're

5742.8 --> 5746.4800000000005
going to choose

5744.239 --> 5749.44
you effectively have free will based on

5746.48 --> 5749.44
the parameters

5751.36 --> 5757.839999999999

5796.639 --> 5799.76
what do you mean dr gonzo but in reality

5798.96 --> 5813.84
it wouldn't

5799.76 --> 5813.84
can you be more specific

5820.48 --> 5824.32
i wouldn't have free will what because

5825.04 --> 5828.96
you didn't give it too many options

5830.159 --> 5834.32
it would be limited to its coding well

5832.159 --> 5836.32
so are we in our own ways even though

5834.32 --> 5839.92
the coding is

5836.32 --> 5841.44
it's a very high potential compared to a

5839.92 --> 5842.639
robot that you're going to be

5841.44 --> 5845.678999999999

and you program it to be extremely

5852.84 --> 5855.84
elaborate

5864.08 --> 5867.119
that's why you don't subscribe to free

5866.32 --> 5870.5599999999995
will well

5867.119 --> 5870.5599999999995
okay sure

5871.52 --> 5875.679
if you don't feel you have a choice well

6603.679 --> 6609.679
fake well we've been presented with a

6607.199 --> 6612.32
lot of cgi

6609.679 --> 6614.159
but as for the wandering stars the

6612.32 --> 6616.239
lights in the sky

6614.159 --> 6617.44
well i think they're luminaries they're

6616.239 --> 6619.759999999999
just light

6617.44 --> 6622.4
rather there's light coming from that

6619.76 --> 6625.92
direction and there's this visual thing

6622.4 --> 6628.32
that appears when you do look directly

6625.92 --> 6628.32
at it

6632.239 --> 6639.839999999999
it's just light

6645.199 --> 6651.839999999999
must be inside the dome

6649.28 --> 6654.239
well i don't know where it is because it

6651.84 --> 6654.88
can be pinpointed to actually come from

6654.239 --> 6658.32
a

6654.88 --> 6661.52
euclidean specific location you can

6658.32 --> 6664.159
triangulate the lights

6661.52 --> 6666.96
when you actually try to prove they are

6664.159 --> 6670.5599999999995
physically in that exact spot

6666.96 --> 6672.56
in space then yeah when

6670.56 --> 6675.360000000001
in the attempt you'll find out that it's

6672.56 --> 6677.599
just going to bend away or disappear

6675.36 --> 6679.5199999999995
so it can't really be pinpointed where

6677.599 --> 6682.8
the light is coming from there's just an

6679.52 --> 6682.8
angular relation

6683.84 --> 6689.52
and can't be pinpointed to a specific

6687.199 --> 6693.119
source with any of the celestial lights

6689.52 --> 6693.119000000001
it's really mysterious that way

6693.679 --> 6698.4
including the sun yeah

6706.8 --> 6723.84
hello mellow fellow you're late

6711.199 --> 6723.839999999999
i'm about to round out the show

6734.84 --> 6740.400000000001
mm-hmm

6736.48 --> 6743.199
no i just i just told you dr gonzo

6740.4 --> 6743.679
these lights are not coming from a fixed

6743.199 --> 6746.799999999999
spot

6743.679 --> 6748.84
in the sky that's the whole that's

6746.8 --> 6751.84
exactly what i explained it

6748.84 --> 6751.84
isn't

6752.0 --> 6757.599
it just appears to come from that angle

6755.52 --> 6762.4800000000005
but it's not actually coming from a

6757.599 --> 6762.4800000000005
specific euclidean point in space

6762.639 --> 6766.2390000000005
can approach it and then basically bump

6765.44 --> 6770.4
into it

6766.239 --> 6771.04
or hold it in your hand or put some kind

6770.4 --> 6773.36
of a

6771.04 --> 6775.04
i don't know a cage around it and then

6773.36 --> 6778.48
blotting it out it's anything

6775.04 --> 6781.84
right it's not a lamp it's not a

6778.48 --> 6783.839999999999
lamp like we make light here on earth

6781.84 --> 6785.599
that's coming from objects and it has a

6783.84 --> 6786.639
distance and in for square law and all

6785.599 --> 6789.76
that no no it's

6786.639 --> 6790.84
something else it's celestial light and

6789.76 --> 6793.76
it's really

6790.84 --> 6796.4800000000005
weird

6793.76 --> 6796.4800000000005
how that works

6803.52 --> 6807.84
and it gets really weird with the sun

6809.679 --> 6813.119
because that thing is so blatantly out

6811.84 --> 6816.4800000000005
there

6813.119 --> 6817.92
and it has so much energy correlating

6816.48 --> 6819.839999999999
with it

6817.92 --> 6823.04
well you could say cause it but yeah

6819.84 --> 6824.56
what is it in order to cause it right

6823.04 --> 6828.639
there's just a lot of energy being

6824.56 --> 6830.88
absorbed and all that visuals

6828.639 --> 6831.92
there's something coming from that

6830.88 --> 6836.88
direction

6831.92 --> 6836.88
a lot but how i don't know

6842.56 --> 6849.119000000001
i looked into the night sky with the

6844.239 --> 6863.839999999999
telescope i have with the p900

6849.119 --> 6863.839999999999
i don't really have a telescope

6864.8 --> 6869.04
the rings yeah saturn is weird

6870.8 --> 6874.88
but you can't really prove that it rings

6873.119 --> 6877.44
though

6874.88 --> 6879.36
because yeah the position of these

6877.44 --> 6883.04
presupposed rings

6879.36 --> 6886.48
around the presupposed ball saturn

6883.04 --> 6889.44
the angle isn't changing you just

6886.48 --> 6890.0
see it this thing like this it just

6889.44 --> 6892.4
looks like

6890.0 --> 6894.0
that and that's it you never get to see

6892.4 --> 6896.638999999999
like oh look saturn

6894.0 --> 6898.639
with the ring around no it's always the

6896.639 --> 6901.04
same angle to it

6898.639 --> 6901.92
so it's just a presupposition that there

6901.04 --> 6904.719
is a ring

6901.92 --> 6906.8
around a ball because you could

6904.719 --> 6910.0
interpret the sight like that

6906.8 --> 6919.84
i've never seen the rings move

6910.0 --> 6919.84
and they damn well should

6943.119 --> 6946.4
yes dr gonzo it amazes me too and that's

6945.76 --> 6949.360000000001
why i say

6946.4 --> 6952.879999999999
it's holographic it is like you're

6949.36 --> 6955.5199999999995
looking at a weird 3d

6952.88 --> 6956.32
signature of the very light that

6955.52 --> 6959.52
manifests

6956.32 --> 6960.159
from that direction suggesting like a

6959.52 --> 6963.4400000000005
hologram

6960.159 --> 6975.839999999999
like it is a thing it's just a signature

6963.44 --> 6975.839999999999
of that light

6986.08 --> 6990.239
sometimes the rings are head on you

6989.199 --> 6992.799999999999
can't even see them

6990.239 --> 6992.799999999999
but where

6998.32 --> 7006.4
the rings do move really

7003.679 --> 7008.56
from non-cgi sightings i'd like to see

7006.4 --> 7017.839999999999
that

7008.56 --> 7017.84
that makes it even weirder

7022.4 --> 7026.879999999999
there's still no proof of any euclidean

7024.719 --> 7028.639
specific location though so as far as

7026.88 --> 7030.56
i'm concerned it's going to be

7028.639 --> 7033.1990000000005
holographic because i don't see any

7030.56 --> 7035.84
physical alternative

7033.199 --> 7038.32
that allow something like that to be

7035.84 --> 7038.32
possible

7039.52 --> 7044.4800000000005
but yeah it is weird and it gets weirder

7042.639 --> 7045.52
and weirder and weirder and weirder and

7044.48 --> 7047.839999999999
weirder and

7045.52 --> 7049.84
eclipses and oh look at all these

7047.84 --> 7053.360000000001
freaking visuals yeah you can distract

7049.84 --> 7053.360000000001
yourself for a lifetime

7053.84 --> 7057.04
it doesn't prove there's anything

7055.52 --> 7059.1990000000005
physical out there though

7057.04 --> 7061.5199999999995
it's still just light they still bend

7059.199 --> 7065.919999999999
away when you try to approach it

7061.52 --> 7069.4400000000005
you can't reach any of it ever

7065.92 --> 7070.8
so yeah it is really weird and surreal

7069.44 --> 7073.598999999999
isn't it

7070.8 --> 7074.0
welcome to the world that's what it is

7073.599 --> 7076.2390000000005
it's

7074.0 --> 7077.36
really weird and mysterious and there's

7076.239 --> 7080.718999999999
so much we don't know

7077.36 --> 7082.639
so many things that tintillate our minds

7080.719 --> 7084.4
and our ways of thinking and looking at

7082.639 --> 7086.2390000000005
things and all the math and all the

7084.4 --> 7088.879999999999
conditioning yeah it's really

7086.239 --> 7089.839999999999
really weird staring you in the face

7088.88 --> 7093.119
forever

7089.84 --> 7096.400000000001
yeah until you die and you'll never know

7093.119 --> 7099.92
probably i think that i might even

7096.4 --> 7100.799999999999
never know for sure i just got theories

7099.92 --> 7102.88
about it

7100.8 --> 7104.159000000001
right you're gonna have to deal with it

7102.88 --> 7107.04
it's really

7104.159 --> 7109.28
surreal and it's real out there the

7107.04 --> 7110.239
reality is surreal and that's just the

7109.28 --> 7113.119
way it is

7110.239 --> 7114.159
there's nothing you can do about it

7113.119 --> 7116.719
presupposing

7114.159 --> 7118.239
things and the leaving things you don't

7116.719 --> 7122.08
know isn't gonna make

7118.239 --> 7126.839999999999
the surrealness go away

7122.08 --> 7129.84
just makes you blind to the reality of

7126.84 --> 7129.84
it

7138.08 --> 7143.84
right so definitely rounding out the

7139.76 --> 7143.84
show now

7143.92 --> 7157.84
by definition reality is real yeah but

7146.159 --> 7157.839999999999
it's also surreal

7168.639 --> 7173.52
yeah dutch sailor you could i do

7171.679 --> 7176.56
sometimes

7173.52 --> 7180.2390000000005
it's just a consideration and so yeah

7176.56 --> 7182.8
as same goes for the matrix

7180.239 --> 7185.759999999999
apparently that's all about [ __ ] now

7182.8 --> 7188.2390000000005
whatever i don't give a [ __ ]

7185.76 --> 7188.88
i haven't noticed you know there's

7188.239 --> 7192.48
nothing

7188.88 --> 7195.92
even indicating any of that in the

7192.48 --> 7198.4
first three movies so

7195.92 --> 7199.92
anyway thanks everyone for coming i hope

7198.4 --> 7202.0
you liked the show

7199.92 --> 7203.4400000000005
i thought it was pretty decent if you

7202.0 --> 7205.36
liked it then please don't forget to

7238.48 --> 7242.32
others

7239.44 --> 7243.919999999999
thanks for being in the chat was good

7242.32 --> 7247.28
interactive

7243.92 --> 7250.32
and yeah don't dis on the ballers

7247.28 --> 7251.599
because they do just ask questions that

7250.32 --> 7253.759999999999
are good to ask

7251.599 --> 7255.599
for me to answer so that i have

7253.76 --> 7259.280000000001
something to engage with

7255.599 --> 7260.56
right anyway i see the flat earth debate

7259.28 --> 7262.5599999999995
just started

7260.56 --> 7266.159000000001
i will be back tomorrow flat earth early

7262.56 --> 7269.119000000001
bird number 801 on this tuesday

7266.159 --> 7270.799999999999
and i'm going to join the debates right

7269.119 --> 7274.48
after this

7270.8 --> 7277.52
still i'm not a troll yes dr gonzo

7274.48 --> 7281.119
i didn't say you were

7277.52 --> 7283.84
and right until the next video

7281.119 --> 7283.839999999999
keep it flat

7284.02 --> 7306.9490000000005
[Music]

7308.84 --> 7311.84
so
