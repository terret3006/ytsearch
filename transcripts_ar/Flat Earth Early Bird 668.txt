138.319 --> 140.879
myself

141.68 --> 148.72
man i've been feeling the iodine

145.2 --> 149.11999999999998
especially last night i had like flashes

148.72 --> 150.8
and

149.12 --> 153.36
things like dream flashes that was

150.8 --> 153.36
pretty weird

155.36 --> 158.56
when i went to bed that is

160.959 --> 165.36
i even took some extra fish i'll see if

163.28 --> 168.879
that would do something and

165.36 --> 172.8
i know i feel really good actually

168.879 --> 176.07999999999998
my jaw cramp is almost

172.8 --> 179.44
almost gone again i had to resist

176.08 --> 182.56
getting coffee this morning really badly

179.44 --> 185.599
i was like i i want it i want it

182.56 --> 187.92000000000002
no don't do it

185.599 --> 190.39999999999998
and i managed to not do it really glad

187.92 --> 190.39999999999998
that i did

190.48 --> 194.48
but yeah it is kind of tough

196.879 --> 200.79999999999998
but yeah i still got my green tea

201.44 --> 205.2
that's still just fine

207.35 --> 213.12
[Music]

209.28 --> 216.879
also got like the spray thing going on

213.12 --> 219.28
and yeah that's that's doing pretty good

216.879 --> 219.28
as well

219.92 --> 223.11999999999998
my lung situation yeah it definitely

222.56 --> 226.64000000000001
does

223.12 --> 229.04
just softens it up

226.64 --> 229.92
and i was having kind of like uh

229.04 --> 233.2
bronchial

229.92 --> 235.51899999999998
issues sort of not even yeah it's just

233.2 --> 237.599
smoker's problems

235.519 --> 238.87900000000002
and yeah it helps somewhat against that

237.599 --> 255.2
too so yeah

238.879 --> 257.44
i'm very happy today

255.2 --> 258.639
yeah yesterday and debates was uh

257.44 --> 261.199
interesting as well

258.639 --> 264.0
like even rumpus came on there i think

261.199 --> 264.0
yeah they did

265.44 --> 270.16
nathan got all rough and everything and

268.32 --> 273.04
yeah it was just a good show

270.16 --> 276.24
so there's a lot of good shows on the

273.04 --> 276.24
flatters debate recently

283.36 --> 290.16
let's see oh yeah

286.96 --> 292.63899999999995
uh oh benjamin was also alive

290.16 --> 292.639
i think

293.44 --> 302.24
what's he

297.36 --> 302.24
oh wait no that was much later i think

303.199 --> 307.759
yeah because i did stay up quite late i

306.32 --> 311.84
think he

307.759 --> 311.84000000000003
was that's not

312.4 --> 318.96
god i'm mixing it up with sunday and

315.44 --> 318.96
this is why i need to make notes

319.6 --> 326.08000000000004
and i forget sometimes it's i get

322.84 --> 328.56
distracted should take it more serious

326.08 --> 329.44
anyway but i did also at least i

328.56 --> 331.12
remember

329.44 --> 333.36
because i rounded out the day with that

331.12 --> 337.44
pretty much watched the second

333.36 --> 340.47900000000004
and the third mummy movie second one was

337.44 --> 342.56
really interesting

340.479 --> 343.59999999999997
with some really weird elements to it as

342.56 --> 346.72
well

343.6 --> 350.72
like the scorpion king

346.72 --> 352.56
and yeah

350.72 --> 353.91900000000004
that final animation where they

352.56 --> 356.88
basically stuck

353.919 --> 358.31899999999996
the actor's face over that scorpion

356.88 --> 361.96
monster thing

358.319 --> 365.36
that look just looked so weird and

361.96 --> 366.96
cgi-ish it looked like

365.36 --> 370.24
i don't know why they did it like that

366.96 --> 373.44
but it it looked so weird

370.24 --> 373.44
like really weird

374.08 --> 380.31899999999996
but the rest of the movie was damn

376.72 --> 383.44000000000005
interesting and

380.319 --> 385.12
like high magic stuff

383.44 --> 389.12
and so was the third movie by the way

385.12 --> 389.12
the third movie was in china

390.479 --> 394.0
and there was just a lot of weirdness

393.12 --> 396.4
about that movie

394.0 --> 396.4
as well

397.12 --> 404.08
like these supposed soldiers

400.56 --> 406.4
that group they were more like nazis

404.08 --> 407.44
they were they were like putting putting

406.4 --> 410.79999999999995
in the role of that

407.44 --> 416.71999999999997
well as far as i know

410.8 --> 419.28000000000003
like china is like not like that at all

416.72 --> 420.72
like they don't believe in superstition

419.28 --> 423.19899999999996
and they tend to actually just destroy

420.72 --> 426.639
destroyed if they got the opportunity

423.199 --> 429.68
and these guys they were kind of like

426.639 --> 433.12
almost like indiana jones nazis

429.68 --> 434.96
this is like trying to rise up the

433.12 --> 438.72
superpower and then hope to be

434.96 --> 442.08
their commander and all that and yeah

438.72 --> 443.36
it's similar to what the mummy one and

442.08 --> 446.4
two

443.36 --> 448.84000000000003
was doing or rather

446.4 --> 451.84
he was that power and then in the second

448.84 --> 451.84
one

452.56 --> 454.72
no

457.759 --> 465.84000000000003
how did that hmm yeah

467.36 --> 473.199
i'm forgetting the point i'm trying to

469.12 --> 473.199
make i'm a bit flustered

473.28 --> 479.44
uh but yeah the

476.639 --> 480.56
the soldiers were like a little bit

479.44 --> 483.039
weird

480.56 --> 485.039
but it was as a movie was very

483.039 --> 488.96
interesting i thought

485.039 --> 492.0
and like the visuals and the magic of it

488.96 --> 493.19899999999996
was pretty fascinating like that movie

492.0 --> 496.4
the third one had

493.199 --> 499.44
so many d and d spells they were

496.4 --> 501.35999999999996
beautifully animated but the effects are

499.44 --> 501.919
just very familiar to me like hey that's

501.36 --> 504.84000000000003
that

501.919 --> 506.15999999999997
that's that all these things exist in

504.84 --> 509.599
dnd

506.16 --> 511.28000000000003
and yeah from that perspective it was a

509.599 --> 514.8
real blast

511.28 --> 518.3199999999999
to watch it it was a giant

514.8 --> 518.3199999999999
mystical adventure

518.399 --> 522.8
yeah very much suited for the d d type

521.68 --> 525.5999999999999
of

522.8 --> 527.04
setup for that type of game like that

525.6 --> 529.6800000000001
movie could be great

527.04 --> 534.24
to have as a dnd campaign it would

529.68 --> 537.3599999999999
probably work really great

534.24 --> 537.92
whether you modernize it which it does

537.36 --> 540.399
exist

537.92 --> 541.5999999999999
or you just keep it you just translate

540.399 --> 544.72
the situations

541.6 --> 547.519
to the the more medieval style

544.72 --> 550.1600000000001
universe that dnd usually takes place in

547.519 --> 552.5600000000001
it would still work

550.16 --> 552.56
anyway

555.12 --> 558.5600000000001
that i do remember

559.2 --> 567.2
it does studio 68

563.279 --> 567.2
brand m good to see you

574.839 --> 579.36
right

577.76 --> 582.3199999999999
so i've been watching some movies

579.36 --> 582.32
playing some games

588.839 --> 593.839
um

591.6 --> 596.64
i usually also end up somewhere in the

593.839 --> 605.2790000000001
day watching at least one restream

596.64 --> 608.88
one premiere of nathan's

605.279 --> 608.88
yeah that that's pretty much it so

612.56 --> 622.7199999999999
nothing particular that comes to mind

619.12 --> 622.72
to talk about as a subject

627.6 --> 634.72
rumpus yeah rumpus got a good treatment

630.72 --> 634.72
and analysis from nathan yesterday

635.839 --> 647.839
that's right

658.839 --> 663.44
okay

661.36 --> 665.44
i don't know it's something weird that

663.44 --> 668.8000000000001
i've been noticing

665.44 --> 670.6400000000001
like in general is

668.8 --> 671.92
because i still keep like watching the

670.64 --> 675.279
alex jones show

671.92 --> 678.0
yeah through the the shows and like

675.279 --> 682.0
david night and the war room sometimes

678.0 --> 684.399
i don't always like really like it

682.0 --> 685.519
because sometimes it's just a bit bland

684.399 --> 688.959
too yeah bland

685.519 --> 690.5600000000001
ooh exciting it's just not really useful

688.959 --> 693.279
to me

690.56 --> 694.399
and sometimes it is so you're yeah you

693.279 --> 696.48
never really know but

694.399 --> 698.8
i'm noticing that there's been a lot of

696.48 --> 702.0
attention recently

698.8 --> 705.5999999999999
like to the whole psychology

702.0 --> 708.88
of in yeah their opponents

705.6 --> 708.88
their ballers as it were

709.2 --> 715.279
yeah the the democrats and the

712.24 --> 718.24
unhinged liberals as it were and it's

715.279 --> 720.56
fascinating because it seems just very

718.24 --> 722.639
similar to what i'm doing

720.56 --> 725.04
with ballers but the the rest of the

722.639 --> 727.279
world as well and i've already pointed

725.04 --> 730.56
that out in many ways that

727.279 --> 734.16
the similarities are just

730.56 --> 736.16
astounding like the way people function

734.16 --> 738.7199999999999
what they're gonna act like in certain

736.16 --> 740.8
situations is

738.72 --> 743.279
it's almost like everything is an echo

740.8 --> 747.8389999999999
of everything else

743.279 --> 751.04
because people just do those things

747.839 --> 753.6
and they also pick up tricks

751.04 --> 755.279
on that same frequency from other groups

753.6 --> 756.9590000000001
as well

755.279 --> 759.12
so it doesn't really matter what you're

756.959 --> 760.079
focused on depending on your frequency

759.12 --> 761.92
you're gonna grow

760.079 --> 763.4399999999999
depending on what you pick up in the

761.92 --> 766.16
outside world that's why it's so

763.44 --> 767.6800000000001
important to keep looking

766.16 --> 770.079
depending on the frequency you're

767.68 --> 774.3199999999999
looking at

770.079 --> 777.92
so i bet you there's all like like that

774.32 --> 781.839
for example cnn is almost

777.92 --> 785.04
an example to just scammers out there

781.839 --> 788.9590000000001
to to figure out what people

785.04 --> 789.92
will probably buy how far they could

788.959 --> 792.6389999999999
push it

789.92 --> 793.519
see so to us it's just they're just

792.639 --> 795.519
insane

793.519 --> 797.839
liars you know it's just like what the

795.519 --> 798.8
[ __ ] these people are so arrogant and so

797.839 --> 801.7600000000001
disgusting and

798.8 --> 802.56
everything they turn around that's kind

801.76 --> 805.2
of like

802.56 --> 806.4799999999999
what they represent to us but you're

805.2 --> 808.32
forgetting there's still plenty of

806.48 --> 811.04
people that don't see that as much

808.32 --> 811.44
that don't have the courage basically to

811.04 --> 815.279
step

811.44 --> 818.0
up to the plate and just get honest with

815.279 --> 820.079
themselves about what the world is

818.0 --> 822.079
and they will be fooled and then there's

820.079 --> 823.76
the category of people that actually

822.079 --> 824.16
like that and want to abuse that that

823.76 --> 827.68
are just

824.16 --> 828.399
shameless bastards sometimes born like

827.68 --> 831.519
that

828.399 --> 835.04
they never had the sense

831.519 --> 836.079
any sense of common decency never got

835.04 --> 839.12
taught that

836.079 --> 839.8389999999999
or they just didn't have the instincts

839.12 --> 842.72
for it

839.839 --> 844.9590000000001
and they see them as examples and like

842.72 --> 844.9590000000001
that

845.199 --> 852.4799999999999
the dark influences learn

849.199 --> 854.079
just as the light forces do it's very

852.48 --> 858.0
weird how that works

854.079 --> 862.2399999999999
but because of the bound principles

858.0 --> 862.24
each frequency each group follows

862.32 --> 868.5600000000001
even though they're learning it doesn't

865.36 --> 871.76
truly help them yeah avoid

868.56 --> 874.0
their fate which by their methodology is

871.76 --> 876.639
kind of set

874.0 --> 877.68
it's on the dark side it's very much

876.639 --> 880.639
focused on just

877.68 --> 881.4399999999999
how to keep on doing what they're doing

880.639 --> 885.839
and

881.44 --> 885.839
making it

886.32 --> 892.5600000000001
like that that's really the

890.32 --> 893.519
the final objective to just keep on

892.56 --> 895.68
going

893.519 --> 899.839
against all odds and like how do you

895.68 --> 899.8389999999999
manipulate everything

900.639 --> 905.199
it's yeah it's interesting when you look

903.279 --> 908.32
at like that

905.199 --> 910.3199999999999
everybody does keep learning but yeah by

908.32 --> 912.399
your methodology

910.32 --> 914.1600000000001
where you're going to end up with what

912.399 --> 917.12
you're learning

914.16 --> 917.12
is kind of set

917.839 --> 921.6
you'll know when where you're going to

921.04 --> 924.88
end up

921.6 --> 928.16
when you wake up to what you're doing

924.88 --> 931.36
see and yeah

928.16 --> 932.88
not everybody can see what people on the

931.36 --> 936.72
other side are

932.88 --> 939.36
truly doing and they well

936.72 --> 940.0790000000001
they don't want to they don't want to go

939.36 --> 942.639
there they want

940.079 --> 945.5999999999999
don't want to experience that because

942.639 --> 945.6
it's confronting

948.959 --> 953.4399999999999
and then the ego gets in the way anyway

951.839 --> 957.0400000000001
i've just been noticing that

953.44 --> 959.36
that there's just

957.04 --> 961.36
a lot more and it's what it's not just

959.36 --> 961.92
like uh just alex jones or something

961.36 --> 964.5600000000001
it's just

961.92 --> 966.56
widespread there's more attention to the

964.56 --> 968.7199999999999
psychology of how these things and how

966.56 --> 972.2399999999999
these people work

968.72 --> 975.0400000000001
and not just straw man puppetry

972.24 --> 975.92
to basically yeah use them as a blaming

975.04 --> 979.12
target

975.92 --> 980.639
pointing out the most absurd things it's

979.12 --> 983.04
also just

980.639 --> 986.399
really getting in their minds more and i

983.04 --> 986.399
like that it's interesting

986.639 --> 990.8
it gives me the feeling that people out

990.24 --> 994.16
there

990.8 --> 996.639
not just me that are truly

994.16 --> 1000.48
trying to defeat evil as it were and

996.639 --> 1000.48
figuring out what that really means

1000.72 --> 1004.48
that they're also growing

1008.16 --> 1012.8
despite their issues and their issues

1011.92 --> 1017.4399999999999
are often

1012.8 --> 1021.04
very much visible more than

1017.44 --> 1021.0400000000001
like what they're overall doing

1022.839 --> 1027.919
anyway

1024.72 --> 1027.919
hey john bernards

1034.24 --> 1042.559
science doesn't prove anything

1039.039 --> 1046.16
body of science yeah

1042.559 --> 1046.16
the ballers are just a mess

1047.679 --> 1049.919
like

1050.72 --> 1057.6000000000001
it almost hurts me to say it because

1054.48 --> 1060.16
like it's so confronting

1057.6 --> 1063.039
but in many ways the way the ballers act

1060.16 --> 1063.039
is very much

1064.84 --> 1070.1599999999999
like

1066.64 --> 1073.679
like hysterical people people that just

1070.16 --> 1073.679
lost their minds like

1073.919 --> 1077.3600000000001
there are certain things that they just

1075.6 --> 1079.039
can't handle so they just

1077.36 --> 1081.6789999999999
as soon as they're reminded about they

1079.039 --> 1083.52
go slightly psychotic

1081.679 --> 1087.2
in their attempts to evade it like the

1083.52 --> 1087.2
ego has full control

1088.16 --> 1094.559
so it is like insanity like obsession

1091.28 --> 1095.6
obsessive insanity can't let go of a

1094.559 --> 1100.0
certain way

1095.6 --> 1102.8799999999999
of believing

1100.0 --> 1102.88
how things are

1103.36 --> 1105.9189999999999
oh god

1107.2 --> 1116.48
alex jones is billy come on why

1111.52 --> 1116.48
this is so bland don't you hear yourself

1117.76 --> 1123.84
like how is all of that relevant to

1120.84 --> 1123.84
anything

1125.06 --> 1128.47
[Music]

1143.28 --> 1145.52
what

1147.44 --> 1152.72
oh i think there's some trolls arriving

1150.4 --> 1152.72
again

1159.6 --> 1168.48
here from the baller brown shirts

1165.44 --> 1170.16
that's what they are aren't they the

1168.48 --> 1173.679
baller brown shirts

1170.16 --> 1175.76
the chat trolls the ones that get in

1173.679 --> 1177.039
flat earthers away as soon as you point

1175.76 --> 1180.16
out something

1177.039 --> 1182.16
about the ball they

1180.16 --> 1183.6000000000001
really don't like especially if you make

1182.16 --> 1186.799
it personal about their

1183.6 --> 1190.24
own struggles they

1186.799 --> 1193.84
get very agitated and then yeah then

1190.24 --> 1193.84
come in the round shirts

1194.44 --> 1197.579
[Music]

1208.159 --> 1214.72
or does that actually mean something pjp

1212.32 --> 1214.72
files

1218.84 --> 1221.84
guys

1241.28 --> 1249.84
oh look who's there

1251.12 --> 1257.6
uh mr jones 1972

1254.88 --> 1258.5590000000002
that's good that you ask that if science

1257.6 --> 1260.9599999999998
proves things

1258.559 --> 1262.6399999999999
why not use science to prove relative

1260.96 --> 1264.559
density this equilibrium as the

1262.64 --> 1268.7990000000002
alternative to gravity

1264.559 --> 1272.559
yes we have that's done

1268.799 --> 1275.52
extensively look it up on

1272.559 --> 1278.72
sleeping warriors channel laid out the

1275.52 --> 1278.72
entire hypothesis

1278.799 --> 1285.679
did the experiment proved

1282.799 --> 1288.559
relative density is the cause of

1285.679 --> 1288.5590000000002
displacement

1289.52 --> 1292.96
no i don't know who that is

1297.28 --> 1305.84
should i know

1330.84 --> 1333.84
what

1334.0 --> 1336.32
dude

1340.64 --> 1349.679
yeah i'm uh i don't know this is weird

1346.64 --> 1351.2800000000002
sleeping warrior tony is saying in the

1349.679 --> 1354.5590000000002
ball buster's chat

1351.28 --> 1356.6399999999999
that apparently boris johnson is calling

1354.559 --> 1359.039
in the army

1356.64 --> 1359.76
and he's saying that's a good thing for

1359.039 --> 1362.799
civilians

1359.76 --> 1362.799
i don't know he didn't

1364.559 --> 1368.72
i guess against the corrupted police i

1367.76 --> 1371.6
don't know it

1368.72 --> 1373.3600000000001
he thinks the he says he thinks it's a

1371.6 --> 1375.84
great thing i don't know what it means

1373.36 --> 1375.84
though

1376.32 --> 1379.84
anybody heard about that

1381.44 --> 1386.559
the peer-reviewed paper why would you

1384.4 --> 1389.8400000000001
need a freaking peer-reviewed paper

1386.559 --> 1393.44
the scientific method proves

1389.84 --> 1395.76
the cause of the effect or disproves it

1393.44 --> 1397.76
repeatable to anyone if you want to

1395.76 --> 1401.52
write a paper about it

1397.76 --> 1405.2
that's fine but a peer review paper

1401.52 --> 1409.679
does not justify

1405.2 --> 1413.52
something it doesn't

1409.679 --> 1417.039
only experimentation justifies

1413.52 --> 1420.1589999999999
something and there is experimentation

1417.039 --> 1420.1589999999999
through hypothesis

1420.88 --> 1424.4
now if others want to peer review that

1422.72 --> 1429.1200000000001
and then i'll say oh but

1424.4 --> 1431.44
no but what about all these ridiculous

1429.12 --> 1433.4399999999998
non-science experiments that supposedly

1431.44 --> 1435.6000000000001
prove gravity blah blah blah i cannot

1433.44 --> 1437.919
condone this this is old-fashioned or

1435.6 --> 1439.76
whatever

1437.919 --> 1441.919
right draw in some weird things that

1439.76 --> 1445.279
have nothing to do that's typically what

1441.919 --> 1447.44
yeah what the people do is that do the

1445.279 --> 1448.799
peer review they just get in the way of

1447.44 --> 1452.159
everyone

1448.799 --> 1454.4
unless it's part of the plan for the

1452.159 --> 1454.4
ball

1454.64 --> 1464.24
part of the club yeah we don't need

1459.2 --> 1468.4
peer review peer review is guild review

1464.24 --> 1470.64
you know all of us could peer review it

1468.4 --> 1472.96
as well if we'd like but you could just

1470.64 --> 1474.72
take our personal testimony

1472.96 --> 1476.96
just ask what do you think about it

1474.72 --> 1487.84
isn't that a peer review

1476.96 --> 1487.8400000000001
we are tony's peers

1490.47 --> 1493.599
[Music]

1498.84 --> 1503.76
damn i don't think he says that blue

1501.679 --> 1505.919
yonder but if he does it has nothing to

1503.76 --> 1510.1589999999999
do with relative density

1505.919 --> 1515.8400000000001
celestial phenomena have nothing to do

1510.159 --> 1515.8400000000001
with earthly experiments

1520.799 --> 1525.12
and he's not gonna correct himself on

1523.44 --> 1528.3200000000002
relative density

1525.12 --> 1530.7199999999998
he's just gonna listen to me

1528.32 --> 1532.559
because he know i outgrew my his

1530.72 --> 1535.84
understanding of it

1532.559 --> 1537.2
i can explain it better but he's got it

1535.84 --> 1540.559
right

1537.2 --> 1544.0
he figured it out he

1540.559 --> 1545.6
defeated me in the gravity debate

1544.0 --> 1548.48
and then i realized gravity is an

1545.6 --> 1549.9189999999999
aberration there is indeed no scientific

1548.48 --> 1552.72
proof for it

1549.919 --> 1556.0800000000002
and the relative density is it is

1552.72 --> 1559.3600000000001
scientifically valid

1556.08 --> 1562.08
empirically and

1559.36 --> 1564.08
then i started to work on that and

1562.08 --> 1566.799
figure out like how does it word

1564.08 --> 1567.6
work in more complex settings then i

1566.799 --> 1570.799
figured out this

1567.6 --> 1573.84
is it this is the thing this

1570.799 --> 1576.0
is what gravity

1573.84 --> 1578.9599999999998
is trying to replace it's the relative

1576.0 --> 1578.96
density effect

1581.44 --> 1589.3600000000001
and every single phenomenon

1585.6 --> 1591.76
involved in gravity

1589.36 --> 1592.799
can be explained through relative

1591.76 --> 1596.08
density

1592.799 --> 1597.6
every single one every single one that's

1596.08 --> 1600.559
actually based on

1597.6 --> 1603.12
earthly situations and not fantastical

1600.559 --> 1606.1589999999999
science fiction situations is supposed

1603.12 --> 1610.08
outer space or anything or orbit

1606.159 --> 1611.2
everything earthly that is associated

1610.08 --> 1614.1589999999999
with gravity

1611.2 --> 1617.039
everything can be directly explained by

1614.159 --> 1617.0390000000002
relative density

1621.679 --> 1626.3200000000002
the direction doesn't come from anything

1623.84 --> 1629.36
the direction is what it is

1626.32 --> 1632.1589999999999
there is no need

1629.36 --> 1633.279
to know why these there's these

1632.159 --> 1637.0390000000002
directions

1633.279 --> 1639.2
there is no need it's only

1637.039 --> 1640.24
your ego that just wants to understand

1639.2 --> 1642.159
why why

1640.24 --> 1644.24
it's a six year old why why well we

1642.159 --> 1645.279
don't know why and you're not gonna find

1644.24 --> 1647.36
out why

1645.279 --> 1648.96
unless you can very manipulate it which

1647.36 --> 1652.1589999999999
you can't

1648.96 --> 1654.24
you can't make

1652.159 --> 1655.5200000000002
an object that is less dense than its

1654.24 --> 1657.679
medium go down

1655.52 --> 1659.6
it's not gonna do that by itself no

1657.679 --> 1662.5590000000002
matter what the frick you do

1659.6 --> 1663.279
no matter the forces it's not gonna do

1662.559 --> 1666.559
that

1663.279 --> 1670.72
so you can't very manipulate

1666.559 --> 1670.72
anything about it the directions are set

1672.88 --> 1676.72
less things less dense than the medium

1675.919 --> 1679.3600000000001
go up

1676.72 --> 1679.919
things denser than the medium go down

1679.36 --> 1684.559
that's

1679.919 --> 1686.64
the way it is and the differential

1684.559 --> 1688.72
between the densities of the object in

1686.64 --> 1692.24
the medium also determine

1688.72 --> 1694.88
how much force is subjected

1692.24 --> 1697.52
to the object in order to achieve the

1694.88 --> 1701.919
displacement

1697.52 --> 1701.9189999999999
the relative density disequilibrium

1708.84 --> 1713.6789999999999
force

1711.6 --> 1716.0
doesn't explain the orbit of light it

1713.679 --> 1720.48
doesn't yeah it

1716.0 --> 1724.24
because there is no orbit of planets

1720.48 --> 1726.24
it's light it's lights in the heavens

1724.24 --> 1729.6
and those lights are can't be proven to

1726.24 --> 1732.32
be physical in any way

1729.6 --> 1734.48
you can even prove a proximity you can't

1732.32 --> 1737.279
even approach it you can't

1734.48 --> 1738.159
get an angular size increase as you

1737.279 --> 1741.52
approach

1738.159 --> 1744.72
what you think is the point where the

1741.52 --> 1744.72
supposed planet is

1744.88 --> 1748.24
it's no proof of any of that

1748.799 --> 1752.8799999999999
so again everything on earth is

1751.2 --> 1756.64
absolutely

1752.88 --> 1759.6000000000001
definable through relative density

1756.64 --> 1761.039
concerning the phenomena of gravity

1759.6 --> 1763.76
associated with gravity

1761.039 --> 1765.76
everything but yeah that's earth that's

1763.76 --> 1766.0
the realm of earth that's what we know

1765.76 --> 1770.1589999999999
is

1766.0 --> 1772.24
here and by how things work we can draw

1770.159 --> 1774.48
conclusions like there is a container

1772.24 --> 1776.08
because there is gas pressure

1774.48 --> 1778.559
so there's a limited amount of space

1776.08 --> 1778.559
above us

1779.12 --> 1784.0
and yeah everything

1782.159 --> 1785.6000000000001
out there all these science fiction

1784.0 --> 1787.2
stories you've been fed since you're a

1785.6 --> 1791.1999999999998
little kid through the television

1787.2 --> 1794.24
through everything pictures paintings

1791.2 --> 1796.0800000000002
planets in an open vacuum and all the

1794.24 --> 1797.76
stars everywhere in the suns and the

1796.08 --> 1801.039
black holes yeah that's all

1797.76 --> 1804.559
science fiction that's mathematical

1801.039 --> 1806.72
reified fantasy

1804.559 --> 1808.399
it's based on mathematics that's how it

1806.72 --> 1811.919
is designed

1808.399 --> 1811.9189999999999
and the rest is artistry

1812.399 --> 1815.84
because yeah it matters a lot if it

1815.12 --> 1819.12
looks

1815.84 --> 1822.399
beautiful and if it would look like

1819.12 --> 1824.2399999999998
and feel like a planet as

1822.399 --> 1826.399
the effect of it because there's

1824.24 --> 1828.72
something to how it looks it has to look

1826.399 --> 1832.399
like a planet

1828.72 --> 1835.44
you gotta get it right and that's it's a

1832.399 --> 1836.8799999999999
mystical thing how that works in routed

1835.44 --> 1839.88
in the psychology

1836.88 --> 1842.3990000000001
psychology of people because entire

1839.88 --> 1845.8400000000001
heliocentrism

1842.399 --> 1850.6399999999999
besides the math is based on

1845.84 --> 1854.6399999999999
psychological effects in human beings

1850.64 --> 1858.159
we appreciate balls the shape of it

1854.64 --> 1858.159
it captivates our minds

1859.36 --> 1862.559
it's all designed with that

1863.279 --> 1866.72
yeah there's no such thing as planets

1864.96 --> 1869.6000000000001
that's right it's a light in the sky

1866.72 --> 1872.32
there's no ball floating in a vacuum

1869.6 --> 1872.32
somewhere else

1874.88 --> 1879.8400000000001
it's a wandering star

1886.62 --> 1890.3799999999999
[Music]

1901.679 --> 1907.8400000000001
yeah you thought you've been to mars you

1904.84 --> 1907.84
did

1910.0 --> 1915.919
oh dear is it mars

1913.519 --> 1916.799
is highly suspected to be a part of

1915.919 --> 1922.48
greenland

1916.799 --> 1922.48
basically they're using landscapes there

1928.96 --> 1932.64
my stance on the moon

1933.36 --> 1937.6
what what's the status about the moon

1938.64 --> 1941.519
it's a hologram

1941.84 --> 1949.6
naturally created hologram

1946.559 --> 1951.84
it's quite mysterious

1949.6 --> 1955.039
yeah i think it is it should be part of

1951.84 --> 1955.039
the original design

1960.399 --> 1963.5189999999998
but all the heavenly bodies effectively

1962.559 --> 1965.9189999999999
are holograms

1963.519 --> 1967.919
including the freaking sun with all that

1965.919 --> 1971.2
sunlight

1967.919 --> 1973.8400000000001
that is coming from a direction not from

1971.2 --> 1973.8400000000001
an object

1974.08 --> 1981.9189999999999
and yeah you see that holographic

1978.159 --> 1983.44
disc at the epicenter of the direction

1981.919 --> 1985.1200000000001
where it's coming from in relation to

1983.44 --> 1987.279
your position and that's the uniqueness

1985.12 --> 1990.08
of it it's just light manifest all of it

1987.279 --> 1991.919
all of it is holographic there's no

1990.08 --> 1993.4399999999998
light hanging in a specific point

1991.919 --> 1998.3200000000002
anywhere

1993.44 --> 2001.279
casting its light it's not happening

1998.32 --> 2003.039
you go there it disappears there's no

2001.279 --> 2006.32
explanation to that

2003.039 --> 2008.399
other than it's holographic in nature

2006.32 --> 2010.08
because that's the only other thing that

2008.399 --> 2012.4799999999998
kind of behaves like that

2010.08 --> 2013.6789999999999
and still suggests it is some kind of

2012.48 --> 2019.84
physical thing

2013.679 --> 2019.8400000000001
to the observer like a rainbow

2021.84 --> 2028.08
and the sky is not like an hd screen no

2025.279 --> 2030.48
no it's literally light manifests it

2028.08 --> 2033.519
manifests it's not coming from an object

2030.48 --> 2036.32
it's just manifesting it's coming

2033.519 --> 2036.799
from a direction it just come comes into

2036.32 --> 2039.6
being

2036.799 --> 2041.36
manifests and when you look at the

2039.6 --> 2045.1999999999998
direction of that specific

2041.36 --> 2048.48
light manifest you see

2045.2 --> 2050.079
a signature a holographic signature a

2048.48 --> 2054.72
disk of some kind

2050.079 --> 2054.7200000000003
or twinkly little light depending

2058.32 --> 2064.48
and yeah it has to be generated somehow

2062.24 --> 2066.399
it's energy especially the sun so it's

2064.48 --> 2068.48
probably electrical nature so

2066.399 --> 2071.7599999999998
i'm presuming currently without any

2068.48 --> 2075.28
direct evidence or even modeling it

2071.76 --> 2078.639
it's a high suspicion

2075.28 --> 2081.2000000000003
that what causes the heavenly lights

2078.639 --> 2083.679
to be to manifest basically is the

2081.2 --> 2087.7599999999998
electric ether the energy that's just

2083.679 --> 2090.879
naturally in this realm for some reason

2087.76 --> 2090.8790000000004
especially higher up

2092.96 --> 2099.92
and that energy is not creating local

2097.28 --> 2102.48
lights to manifest like star in a jar or

2099.92 --> 2105.92
anything is still local phenomena right

2102.48 --> 2110.0
it's nothing like that no

2105.92 --> 2113.04
it's just its presence is somehow

2110.0 --> 2114.72
having these lights manifesting as a

2113.04 --> 2117.7599999999998
side effect it has to be

2114.72 --> 2121.359
something like that because that's yeah

2117.76 --> 2121.3590000000004
i can't explain it any other way

2123.28 --> 2132.48
i figured it out kmlw1 nz

2129.44 --> 2132.48
i figured it out

2133.52 --> 2137.04
i'm still figuring it out

2137.44 --> 2140.2400000000002
i'm partially

2140.48 --> 2147.28
yeah just i'm partially in the dark

2144.24 --> 2149.04
about this because i don't have any

2147.28 --> 2152.0
conclusive evidence

2149.04 --> 2153.2799999999997
or even a model for it but yeah the

2152.0 --> 2156.56
holographic nature

2153.28 --> 2160.96
is there there's just no proof

2156.56 --> 2164.16
anything else than that no no proximity

2160.96 --> 2167.28
no approach no perspective

2164.16 --> 2171.839
laws being applied to any of it

2167.28 --> 2173.44
so yeah what else do you have to go on

2171.839 --> 2175.2
but just saying yeah it's holographic

2173.44 --> 2175.92
i'm not going to think about what causes

2175.2 --> 2178.16
it

2175.92 --> 2180.32
i will think about what caused it well

2178.16 --> 2181.1189999999997
only thing that i know that can manifest

2180.32 --> 2186.079
light

2181.119 --> 2188.1600000000003
in any sort of way is electricity

2186.079 --> 2190.6400000000003
there's plenty of that in the realm

2188.16 --> 2192.8799999999997
other than yeah chemical fire but that's

2190.64 --> 2194.0789999999997
definitely not what it is because then

2192.88 --> 2201.839
it would be that can

2194.079 --> 2201.8390000000004
only ever be local

2205.359 --> 2211.119
no no manifest it's not psychological

2208.32 --> 2211.119
manifesting

2213.28 --> 2219.3590000000004
light manifest is simply is

2216.4 --> 2219.76
empty i'm trying to emphasize its light

2219.359 --> 2225.2
that's

2219.76 --> 2227.3590000000004
there literally coming to you

2225.2 --> 2231.52
but there's something mysterious about

2227.359 --> 2234.64
it because it's absolutely real to you

2231.52 --> 2237.2
in your position but somebody else

2234.64 --> 2240.24
looking at you from a very far

2237.2 --> 2243.359
different position yeah that

2240.24 --> 2245.7599999999998
light does not seem to reach you from

2243.359 --> 2247.839
the other perspective because to them

2245.76 --> 2249.0400000000004
the lights of the heavens are arranged

2247.839 --> 2252.64
differently

2249.04 --> 2256.16
so yeah you might be in between a cloud

2252.64 --> 2258.0
and the sun to the other observer and no

2256.16 --> 2260.0
light reaching you even though even

2258.0 --> 2261.28
though in your position there is light

2260.0 --> 2263.599
reaching you you are feeling

2261.28 --> 2265.8390000000004
yeah super mysterious i can't freaking

2263.599 --> 2268.6400000000003
explain it

2265.839 --> 2270.88
fourth dimension right then gets just

2268.64 --> 2271.839
into pseudoscience like that there's no

2270.88 --> 2274.4
use to

2271.839 --> 2276.96
speculate i wanna figure it out

2274.4 --> 2276.96
physically

2278.079 --> 2282.1600000000003
i can conceptualize it model it sort of

2280.4 --> 2282.64
in a fourth dimensional way but it's no

2282.16 --> 2284.3999999999996
use

2282.64 --> 2286.56
there's no use doing that because it

2284.4 --> 2289.28
just this contorts

2286.56 --> 2290.96
it out of physical reality and then from

2289.28 --> 2291.92
that point on i can't prove anything

2290.96 --> 2294.8
about it anymore

2291.92 --> 2296.2400000000002
physically see so that's why i try not

2294.8 --> 2298.4
to do that

2296.24 --> 2299.4399999999996
that was very appealing storytelling

2298.4 --> 2303.28
time i know

2299.44 --> 2305.599
everybody love it but i don't wanna

2303.28 --> 2307.52
because there's no use for me i can't do

2305.599 --> 2310.6400000000003
anything with it

2307.52 --> 2312.96
so instead it's just there to

2310.64 --> 2315.2
light manifest just means it's not

2312.96 --> 2319.04
coming from a specific point

2315.2 --> 2319.2799999999997
in space and it's not being generated by

2319.04 --> 2323.119
an

2319.28 --> 2325.28
object in a specific location

2323.119 --> 2326.88
to generate light it's just light

2325.28 --> 2331.44
reaching you because of

2326.88 --> 2331.44
how the celestial lights work

2335.76 --> 2341.28
moon projected onto no there is no

2339.119 --> 2343.76
moon being projected on anything it's

2341.28 --> 2343.76
not a

2344.0 --> 2349.44
beam projecting a light onto something

2348.079 --> 2351.2000000000003
that's not what i'm talking about it's

2349.44 --> 2354.2400000000002
not that type of hologram

2351.2 --> 2356.3199999999997
hologram simply points the word it's lit

2354.24 --> 2359.5989999999997
i'm taking the word literal this is not

2356.32 --> 2362.56
a hologram as in oh look the technology

2359.599 --> 2364.48
can make this hologram so that means i'm

2362.56 --> 2368.7999999999997
talking about this hologram no

2364.48 --> 2373.28
hologram simply means image of light

2368.8 --> 2375.8390000000004
it's a light phenomenon

2373.28 --> 2376.7200000000003
that's why i call it holographic it's

2375.839 --> 2380.64
literal i'm

2376.72 --> 2384.0789999999997
literally using the word

2380.64 --> 2384.64
it's not oh a name based on a technology

2384.079 --> 2387.8390000000004
no i'm

2384.64 --> 2391.359
literally using the word holographic

2387.839 --> 2391.359
as what it literally means

2392.32 --> 2398.48
and the actual holographic element

2396.48 --> 2400.2400000000002
that is the most significantly

2398.48 --> 2403.599
holographic is

2400.24 --> 2407.359
most suggesting of the actual technology

2403.599 --> 2409.92
are the signatures of the light

2407.359 --> 2411.7599999999998
that you see at the epicenter of the

2409.92 --> 2413.04
lights direction so with the moon you

2411.76 --> 2415.92
see that

2413.04 --> 2418.48
that image with all these apparent

2415.92 --> 2421.359
craters and apparent shadows

2418.48 --> 2423.359
it's very weird how that works and with

2421.359 --> 2424.96
the sun you see that blinding blinding

2423.359 --> 2426.72
disc

2424.96 --> 2428.56
that almost looks like a hole in the

2426.72 --> 2432.72
wall through which light is

2428.56 --> 2435.839
coming and yeah it's pretty miraculous

2432.72 --> 2438.8799999999997
looking it's holographic guys

2435.839 --> 2441.839
look when the sun hits the clouds

2438.88 --> 2443.92
nothing looks like that only the sun

2441.839 --> 2446.0
hitting the clouds looks like the sun

2443.92 --> 2449.2000000000003
hitting the clouds you can't

2446.0 --> 2451.44
you can't emulate that

2449.2 --> 2453.1189999999997
you can potentially do that maybe with

2451.44 --> 2455.839
3ds

2453.119 --> 2456.88
animation but in a physical setup you

2455.839 --> 2459.44
can't

2456.88 --> 2461.6800000000003
emulate that like that it never looks

2459.44 --> 2464.2400000000002
like that you can't do it there's no

2461.68 --> 2465.7599999999998
way in physical reality with physical

2464.24 --> 2469.1189999999997
things you can recreate

2465.76 --> 2471.44
how the clouds look when the sun hits

2469.119 --> 2473.92
them from behind there's just no way

2471.44 --> 2473.92
no way

2477.2 --> 2480.56
and the way you see that with your own

2478.88 --> 2484.8
eyes is very different even

2480.56 --> 2488.0789999999997
from when you just have have it filmed

2484.8 --> 2491.119
because your eyes see 3d so you're

2488.079 --> 2494.6400000000003
yeah technically your eyes

2491.119 --> 2497.359
you know by my conception that

2494.64 --> 2499.5989999999997
the holographic lobe of the heavens is a

2497.359 --> 2502.0
specific side effect of the design of

2499.599 --> 2504.56
eyes itself

2502.0 --> 2506.48
like a light side effect as design of a

2504.56 --> 2510.96
realm like the eyes are around

2506.48 --> 2510.96
and so this demi sphere

2511.119 --> 2515.76
is presented to the observer as a demi

2513.92 --> 2518.0
sphere of light

2515.76 --> 2519.3590000000004
technically surrounding the epicenter of

2518.0 --> 2523.44
your eye

2519.359 --> 2526.7999999999997
but because we have two eyes that means

2523.44 --> 2527.68
that we kind of have two different globe

2526.8 --> 2531.599
of the heavens

2527.68 --> 2534.48
slightly off and i think that may be

2531.599 --> 2537.839
what sometimes causes yeah sunlight to

2534.48 --> 2537.839
look that amazing

2539.359 --> 2544.24
test my moon theory what theory

2547.359 --> 2552.48
i have no scientific theory this is all

2550.88 --> 2554.079
conceptual

2552.48 --> 2556.96
you know i can't very manipulate

2554.079 --> 2556.96
anything about it

2558.96 --> 2565.359
i i'm not going to like manipulate

2562.8 --> 2567.28
like potentially damage my eye for

2565.359 --> 2569.04
example to test if the globe of the

2567.28 --> 2569.599
heavens would look differently like if

2569.04 --> 2573.2
you had

2569.599 --> 2573.839
a squared eye would you see the globe of

2573.2 --> 2577.4399999999996
the heavens

2573.839 --> 2580.56
squared or something like that roughly

2577.44 --> 2582.48
yeah i don't know but maybe with

2580.56 --> 2584.4
specific type of cameras you could

2582.48 --> 2587.599
potentially test this effect

2584.4 --> 2587.599
it would be fascinating

2591.2 --> 2596.7999999999997
so i guess maybe it could be tested at

2593.76 --> 2596.8
least the eye part

2598.24 --> 2605.2799999999997
but how do you test holographic

2601.359 --> 2606.56
well if you can't turn it off and on

2605.28 --> 2609.52
again

2606.56 --> 2610.24
then you can't test it you can only

2609.52 --> 2614.16
basically

2610.24 --> 2616.64
prove that it's or basically disprove

2614.16 --> 2617.359
its physical or can you wait you can at

2616.64 --> 2619.359
least

2617.359 --> 2620.4
point at all the missing evidence it's

2619.359 --> 2622.4
physical

2620.4 --> 2624.88
and that it doesn't abide to typical

2622.4 --> 2628.2400000000002
object loss

2624.88 --> 2630.56
like you approach it it grows in angular

2628.24 --> 2632.0
size and definitely doesn't suddenly

2630.56 --> 2633.359
bend away

2632.0 --> 2635.119
even if you're going in a perfect

2633.359 --> 2637.52
straight line towards it it just

2635.119 --> 2640.8
constantly bends and you have to

2637.52 --> 2643.68
rotate where you're going to keep going

2640.8 --> 2644.319
towards it that sort of thing yeah that

2643.68 --> 2648.16
doesn't make

2644.319 --> 2651.2799999999997
any damn sense with physical objects

2648.16 --> 2652.96
that's already a telltale sign that it's

2651.28 --> 2656.48
not a physical object because

2652.96 --> 2660.839
that not how physical objects work

2656.48 --> 2662.56
they don't bend away when you approach

2660.839 --> 2664.7999999999997
them

2662.56 --> 2664.7999999999997
so

2667.04 --> 2670.24
how you don't bounce lasers off a

2669.119 --> 2673.839
holographic moon

2670.24 --> 2673.839
are you are you insane

2674.079 --> 2680.96
straight through there is no thing to go

2677.92 --> 2683.2000000000003
through it's about

2680.96 --> 2684.0
like it's a hologram it's in the

2683.2 --> 2685.68
backdrop

2684.0 --> 2687.44
things can get in front of it so yeah

2685.68 --> 2691.7599999999998
the laser will

2687.44 --> 2694.079
never go through it it's not that

2691.76 --> 2696.96
the apparent the appearance of it is not

2694.079 --> 2696.96
that close by

2697.76 --> 2702.2400000000002
it's literally at the edge of vision so

2700.72 --> 2705.04
yeah at the edge of vision

2702.24 --> 2719.839
there is nothing beyond so nothing is

2705.04 --> 2719.839
ever going to go through it

2725.44 --> 2733.28
can conceptual mean speculative yes

2727.76 --> 2736.4
conceptual basically means speculative

2733.28 --> 2739.92
but conceptual

2736.4 --> 2739.92
emphasizes more

2740.56 --> 2744.64
a self-containing structure where

2743.2 --> 2761.839
speculative can mean

2744.64 --> 2761.839
you're just randomly blabbering about it

2781.599 --> 2786.4
yeah so yeah you can't bounce lasers off

2785.2 --> 2789.839
the holographic moon

2786.4 --> 2793.76
and you can't bounce ram radio ham

2789.839 --> 2795.359
signals of the holographic moon as well

2793.76 --> 2797.44
and i know there's all these claims out

2795.359 --> 2798.64
there but i've never seen the actual

2797.44 --> 2800.8
evidence for that

2798.64 --> 2803.52
because it could be doable if it is a

2800.8 --> 2805.2000000000003
thing and it said exactly how to do it

2803.52 --> 2808.88
i've dedicated

2805.2 --> 2810.7999999999997
entire early bird episodes to how to

2808.88 --> 2813.76
prove that you can

2810.8 --> 2815.52
potentially bounce a ham radio signal

2813.76 --> 2819.6800000000003
off the moon

2815.52 --> 2822.24
and i don't even care what why

2819.68 --> 2823.52
it's just how do you do it it's very

2822.24 --> 2825.9199999999996
simple you take

2823.52 --> 2828.079
the the thing you're protecting the ham

2825.92 --> 2829.599
signal with

2828.079 --> 2832.6400000000003
right you have this all in camera you

2829.599 --> 2835.28
have like an arm camera

2832.64 --> 2836.24
holding the thing and you have the sky

2835.28 --> 2838.96
then you have the moon

2836.24 --> 2840.3999999999996
in the sky you point to at it you should

2838.96 --> 2843.92
get a signal read out

2840.4 --> 2845.44
live like suddenly oh there's a readout

2843.92 --> 2845.839
because it's bouncing off something

2845.44 --> 2847.92
right

2845.839 --> 2849.119
then you point it at you then it's gone

2847.92 --> 2850.96
you're not boy

2849.119 --> 2852.1600000000003
yeah not pointing it at the moon anymore

2850.96 --> 2853.92
you point at it

2852.16 --> 2856.64
yeah it's your sickness registering

2853.92 --> 2857.119
again with multiple cameras at the same

2856.64 --> 2859.44
time

2857.119 --> 2861.04
and a singular camera having the person

2859.44 --> 2862.64
with the camera in hand and the other

2861.04 --> 2866.0
camera on the computer

2862.64 --> 2869.04
read out all there at the same time

2866.0 --> 2871.52
in one singular shot next to all of it

2869.04 --> 2872.88
and that's the way you prove you're

2871.52 --> 2874.88
actually doing it

2872.88 --> 2875.92
it's not just like oh look i have a

2874.88 --> 2878.8
computer see

2875.92 --> 2880.88
it says it has a signal readout what

2878.8 --> 2886.079
there's no moon in the sky anywhere

2880.88 --> 2888.319
well that doesn't matter uh

2886.079 --> 2889.6800000000003
there's videos of that it's completely

2888.319 --> 2893.52
useless

2889.68 --> 2896.7999999999997
absolutely abominable it's so

2893.52 --> 2898.8
dumb that people just latch onto that

2896.8 --> 2900.079
so yeah it's it shouldn't be that

2898.8 --> 2902.88
difficult to prove it

2900.079 --> 2905.76
if it was possible and this is how you

2902.88 --> 2910.079
get misunderstandings out of the way

2905.76 --> 2910.079
vary and manipulate the signal

2910.16 --> 2913.52
visibly pointing it at the moon then

2912.88 --> 2915.76
pointing it

2913.52 --> 2917.92
away from the moon are you getting a

2915.76 --> 2920.079
readout when you point it at the moon

2917.92 --> 2922.7200000000003
and is it that readout gonna go away

2920.079 --> 2924.6400000000003
when you point it away from the moon

2922.72 --> 2926.48
right well that will be a good first

2924.64 --> 2930.24
hint to actually

2926.48 --> 2930.2400000000002
start proving that it's real

2930.4 --> 2935.119
but yeah i have bounces off barrier but

2933.599 --> 2936.6400000000003
that's the whole point george sanford

2935.119 --> 2941.44
don't you get that

2936.64 --> 2945.1189999999997
don't you understand i just i just

2941.44 --> 2947.599
explained exactly the situation

2945.119 --> 2949.04
how to prove it because if you would

2947.599 --> 2950.48
point away from the moon

2949.04 --> 2952.079
and there's still going to be the same

2950.48 --> 2953.92
signal read out yeah

2952.079 --> 2956.1600000000003
then it's not coming from the moon it's

2953.92 --> 2958.7200000000003
not bouncing off the moon it's just

2956.16 --> 2960.7999999999997
a signal readout that could be bouncing

2958.72 --> 2964.5589999999997
off something

2960.8 --> 2964.559
but it would definitely not be the moon

2966.0 --> 2970.72
that's why there's the varying and

2968.319 --> 2974.0
manipulating of the signal

2970.72 --> 2974.0
with that see

2980.72 --> 2985.2799999999997
you don't mr jones that's the whole

2983.359 --> 2988.48
point and i just explained to you

2985.28 --> 2990.6400000000003
how you could prove to me

2988.48 --> 2992.48
that the moon could potentially have

2990.64 --> 2995.7599999999998
some physical nature or a

2992.48 --> 2997.119
signal rebouncing nature in direct

2995.76 --> 3001.5200000000004
correlation with the

2997.119 --> 3001.52
visual of the moon apparition

3001.599 --> 3005.44
that there's a signal rebounds right you

3004.079 --> 3009.599
could disprove me you can

3005.44 --> 3013.28
disprove all arwen's hologram talk

3009.599 --> 3016.48
stupid hologrammer we landed on it yeah

3013.28 --> 3018.48
we landed on it it's not a hologram well

3016.48 --> 3020.48
why don't you freaking prove it then why

3018.48 --> 3023.839
don't you do exactly

3020.48 --> 3026.8
what i asked to do point a

3023.839 --> 3028.319
signal at the moon get the signal read

3026.8 --> 3031.119
out live on the spot

3028.319 --> 3033.359
and point it away from the moon no more

3031.119 --> 3036.4
signal readout

3033.359 --> 3039.359
it's not that difficult guys it's not

3036.4 --> 3040.96
that difficult you can prove it or

3039.359 --> 3043.52
disprove it

3040.96 --> 3044.559
why doesn't anybody do this where are

3043.52 --> 3046.88
all these stupid

3044.559 --> 3049.119
fake videos suggesting that they're

3046.88 --> 3052.1600000000003
doing that without doing any of this

3049.119 --> 3054.6400000000003
without even showing the freaking moon

3052.16 --> 3056.0789999999997
in the shot there's no proof that the

3054.64 --> 3059.2
moon is even there

3056.079 --> 3069.8390000000004
in any of those videos it's so [ __ ]

3059.2 --> 3069.839
it's so stupid i can't believe it

3070.4 --> 3075.52
oh mr jones you're not listening you're

3073.599 --> 3077.839
literally not listening why don't you

3075.52 --> 3080.88
present the evidence for your claim the

3077.839 --> 3083.52
moon signal rebounds is your claim

3080.88 --> 3086.7200000000003
i never claimed you could do it i am

3083.52 --> 3089.92
very skeptical about it

3086.72 --> 3092.72
yeah but i don't care

3089.92 --> 3094.64
i care enough to basically present to

3092.72 --> 3097.359
the outside world and the ballers that

3094.64 --> 3100.7999999999997
really want this claim to be real

3097.359 --> 3103.44
about the moon signal rebounds right

3100.8 --> 3104.6400000000003
i'm giving them the opportunity to

3103.44 --> 3107.119
convince me

3104.64 --> 3108.839
that it is a thing by presenting the

3107.119 --> 3112.559
exact

3108.839 --> 3115.92
required setup to prove it to me

3112.559 --> 3117.8390000000004
and i've done this now many times the

3115.92 --> 3119.52
the show's been out there for almost a

3117.839 --> 3124.0789999999997
year i think

3119.52 --> 3126.319
so where is it where's the proof

3124.079 --> 3127.52
i don't care to do it myself it's not my

3126.319 --> 3130.4
claim

3127.52 --> 3132.8
but i'll help you in convincing me

3130.4 --> 3135.28
telling you exactly what you need to do

3132.8 --> 3139.04
to convince me and not just me you'd

3135.28 --> 3142.96
convince the whole freaking world

3139.04 --> 3144.96
you'll show them you'll show them so why

3142.96 --> 3148.079
don't you freaking do it

3144.96 --> 3150.319
people with ham radios

3148.079 --> 3152.0
that are blabbering about oh moon signal

3150.319 --> 3153.52
rebounds you got it right well why don't

3152.0 --> 3154.8
you freaking prove it why don't you do

3153.52 --> 3158.4
it on camera

3154.8 --> 3161.52
show the freaking moon in the sky point

3158.4 --> 3164.2400000000002
the signal thing antenna whatever

3161.52 --> 3166.079
add it point it away from it and show

3164.24 --> 3166.319
that there is a signal when you point at

3166.079 --> 3167.6800000000003
it

3166.319 --> 3170.24
and there's no signal when you don't

3167.68 --> 3173.44
point at it in the exact

3170.24 --> 3174.5589999999997
live setup requiring at least three

3173.44 --> 3177.68
cameras

3174.559 --> 3180.1600000000003
one at the arm with

3177.68 --> 3180.7999999999997
holding the signal showing it pointing

3180.16 --> 3184.0789999999997
away

3180.8 --> 3185.2000000000003
pointing at the moon one close-up at the

3184.079 --> 3188.4
computer

3185.2 --> 3189.7599999999998
readout showing the live signal readout

3188.4 --> 3194.2400000000002
and one camera

3189.76 --> 3197.5200000000004
showing both live at a short distance

3194.24 --> 3199.7599999999998
at the bottom in one singular

3197.52 --> 3202.559
live setup you require three cameras the

3199.76 --> 3202.559
ham radio

3203.04 --> 3209.119
and i don't know a set of balls i guess

3207.359 --> 3210.96
i think it's very scary to a lot of

3209.119 --> 3212.8
ballers out there they'd love to make

3210.96 --> 3214.64
the claim about the signal they even

3212.8 --> 3216.96
brag about their equipment

3214.64 --> 3218.48
but nobody seems to be doing this even

3216.96 --> 3222.2400000000002
though that would be

3218.48 --> 3224.48
a blast will be a blast if

3222.24 --> 3225.839
yeah if you got that if you actually got

3224.48 --> 3228.0
that on camera

3225.839 --> 3229.119
and you proved it holy [ __ ] would you

3228.0 --> 3231.52
show the world

3229.119 --> 3233.359
would you show us flat earthers you

3231.52 --> 3236.48
would show us something at least

3233.359 --> 3240.319
so why don't you do it

3236.48 --> 3242.88
no no i i literally told you exactly

3240.319 --> 3243.839
what you need to do to prove it to

3242.88 --> 3246.319
yourself

3243.839 --> 3248.88
and to the entire world and to flat

3246.319 --> 3252.48
earthers and to me

3248.88 --> 3254.1600000000003
that you can indeed bounce this signal

3252.48 --> 3256.96
of the moon

3254.16 --> 3257.52
and you do it by life on camera showing

3256.96 --> 3259.92
that you

3257.52 --> 3261.92
are varying and manipulating the

3259.92 --> 3264.319
direction of the signal

3261.92 --> 3266.88
and that it actually changes that there

3264.319 --> 3269.7599999999998
is a special readout when you bounce it

3266.88 --> 3270.8
off the moon right supposedly when you

3269.76 --> 3272.8
point it at it and

3270.8 --> 3274.0
you don't get that signal when you don't

3272.8 --> 3277.3590000000004
point at it

3274.0 --> 3279.92
and you can not just uh but just

3277.359 --> 3280.72
[ __ ] around with it you know show it

3279.92 --> 3283.119
that it's just

3280.72 --> 3283.7599999999998
literally a live readout thing that it's

3283.119 --> 3287.599
literally

3283.76 --> 3289.0400000000004
fluid that's proof that's how you prove

3287.599 --> 3290.7200000000003
it do you want to prove it do you want

3289.04 --> 3293.04
to prove this claim

3290.72 --> 3294.8799999999997
don't you want it do you want to just

3293.04 --> 3295.68
blabber about it all day long and tell

3294.88 --> 3298.319
you oh

3295.68 --> 3300.799
why did you just do it what did you just

3298.319 --> 3303.52
do why did you disprove our claim

3300.799 --> 3305.04
huh you want to do that all day long

3303.52 --> 3307.839
just want to be a little [ __ ] in your

3305.04 --> 3307.839
basement

3308.24 --> 3312.0789999999997
just a bunch of trolly whiny [ __ ] is

3310.799 --> 3314.559
that what you want

3312.079 --> 3315.599
or you actually want to back up some of

3314.559 --> 3318.48
the claims

3315.599 --> 3319.76
that you love so much with some evidence

3318.48 --> 3322.799
evidence that would blow

3319.76 --> 3324.0
everybody away i just told you exactly

3322.799 --> 3327.28
how to do it

3324.0 --> 3330.24
this is not a trick setup this

3327.28 --> 3332.7200000000003
everybody that will hear this and have

3330.24 --> 3334.4799999999996
have a mind

3332.72 --> 3335.9199999999996
knowing what i'm talking about about

3334.48 --> 3338.799
physics about yeah

3335.92 --> 3339.92
this is how you prove that why don't you

3338.799 --> 3342.799
do it

3339.92 --> 3343.92
why don't you provide the evidence for

3342.799 --> 3349.839
your claim
