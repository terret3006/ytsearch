91.68 --> 96.42
through that

93.78 --> 99.2
right the weather today is

96.42 --> 99.2
beautiful

100.74 --> 108.96
it's mostly Blue Clear Skies there are a

105.479 --> 113.6
couple of sheep clouds in the distance

108.96 --> 113.6
and there's 12 Trails being laid

117.0 --> 123.92
so I think it's probably going to get a

119.939 --> 123.91999999999999
little hazier as the day progresses

124.259 --> 128.24
the same time it is very windy

132.12 --> 138.06
but yeah beautiful

135.06 --> 138.06
some

152.239 --> 155.66
ooh Focus

158.22 --> 164.3
right yeah there's a lot of light coming

160.08 --> 164.3
off the wall behind me

165.42 --> 172.04
hello M first in chat Alice G good to

169.8 --> 172.04000000000002
see you

172.68 --> 181.58
it is Friday the 29th of October 2021

176.94 --> 181.57999999999998
man how this month has flown by

182.58 --> 185.18
incredible

191.519 --> 196.70000000000002
right

193.62 --> 196.70000000000002
check the temperature

198.18 --> 205.04000000000002
15 degrees hmm

201.12 --> 205.04
it doesn't feel like that in the Sun

206.64 --> 210.98
right hello slo-mo moon buggy good to

208.739 --> 210.98000000000002
see you

211.86 --> 216.44000000000003
so yeah yesterday no flat Earth debates

214.2 --> 219.42
Nathan's

216.44 --> 223.98
projector broke

219.42 --> 228.44
think although while he is he said not

223.98 --> 228.44
too long ago he is doing a show today so

232.56 --> 237.98
but yeah yesterday no flat Earth debates

234.78 --> 237.98
live at least

238.739 --> 243.9
all right there were a couple of

241.319 --> 248.35999999999999
interesting streams

243.9 --> 248.36
unfortunately I missed most of them

250.08 --> 256.259
but yeah I did take a quick look

251.939 --> 258.239
apparently taboo conspiracy was on

256.259 --> 261.73900000000003
on with him

258.239 --> 261.739
with Mitchell from Australia

261.959 --> 267.199
it looked interesting but yeah I didn't

263.88 --> 267.199
didn't see it

270.06 --> 276.139
uh

272.58 --> 276.139
yeah because I was kind of busy

277.44 --> 284.04
playing video games and also yeah I got

280.56 --> 286.52
myself to watch Dune this time and I did

284.04 --> 286.52000000000004
watch it

289.56 --> 295.639
and yeah

292.74 --> 295.639
I think that

296.04 --> 301.88
the reviews I've seen of it were pretty

299.34 --> 301.88
accurate

302.639 --> 307.8
and yeah overall I think it it was a

305.22 --> 309.6
very art artistic

307.8 --> 312.66
in a good way

309.6 --> 314.82000000000005
artistically consistent presentation the

312.66 --> 316.38000000000005
Dune universe

314.82 --> 318.36
probably

316.38 --> 322.02
better than any

318.36 --> 324.66
previous movie or miniserie it was like

322.02 --> 327.35999999999996
really

324.66 --> 329.82000000000005
onto the atmosphere and to the culture

327.36 --> 333.0
and style

329.82 --> 335.039
but I did notice that it's almost like

333.0 --> 337.5
the movie there was a little bit too

335.039 --> 339.96
much emphasis on this that was typically

337.5 --> 342.18
the criticism that I heard

339.96 --> 345.0
from the reviews and yeah that did stand

342.18 --> 348.539
out to me music

345.0 --> 349.74
was also interesting it reminded me a

348.539 --> 352.62
little bit about

349.74 --> 354.84000000000003
uh was it tenet

352.62 --> 356.28000000000003
because of the

354.84 --> 359.17999999999995
like

356.28 --> 359.17999999999995
the weird

359.819 --> 364.74
Electro

362.46 --> 365.94
effect but at the same time mixed in

364.74 --> 368.28000000000003
with like

365.94 --> 370.259
like Mongolian throat singing which is

368.28 --> 372.96
freaking awesome and they eat it and got

370.259 --> 375.62
Bagpipes in there for a moment

372.96 --> 378.59999999999997
so I I really like most of the music

375.62 --> 381.38
except for a few things

378.6 --> 381.38
and that is

381.539 --> 387.96
well what the reviewer said like there's

384.3 --> 390.78000000000003
not really good transition

387.96 --> 393.12
between all of the landscape and like

390.78 --> 396.05999999999995
combat situations it's like they kind of

393.12 --> 398.6
just do the same thing and and that's

396.06 --> 398.6
yeah

399.06 --> 404.06
it's almost a little off-putting

401.28 --> 404.05999999999995
and

404.22 --> 408.96000000000004
like

405.6 --> 411.18
there's this typical cliche

408.96 --> 414.479
of a desert and then like the woman

411.18 --> 415.5
voice going ah right that's all very

414.479 --> 419.28
cute

415.5 --> 423.3
but it's really annoying when you hear

419.28 --> 425.69899999999996
that a lot it's really annoying like

423.3 --> 429.06
used to be like oh that's so cool it's

425.699 --> 430.319
so cultural well now it's just really

429.06 --> 432.24
annoying

430.319 --> 434.819
it's like it's somewhere somebody shut

432.24 --> 439.28000000000003
that woman up sorry is

434.819 --> 439.28000000000003
not that it's not well sung it's just

439.44 --> 445.139
if you want to apply that apply it

442.52 --> 447.599
dramatically at very specific moments

445.139 --> 449.46000000000004
and keep it to that and don't just use

447.599 --> 451.5
it for the background

449.46 --> 453.06
while looking over at Landscapes

451.5 --> 454.56
constantly because it gives me the

453.06 --> 456.66
response like could somebody just shut

454.56 --> 459.56
that woman up I'm trying to enjoy the

456.66 --> 459.56
scenery here

461.46 --> 468.23999999999995
so I would have personally chosen to cut

464.9 --> 470.28
that out a little

468.24 --> 472.74
still have it in somewhere because it

470.28 --> 475.55999999999995
did fit here and there but then it's

472.74 --> 477.599
like okay now you shut up and just let

475.56 --> 480.3
the men take over with the throat

477.599 --> 482.46
singing and all that's much better oh

480.3 --> 485.66
did you redo like

482.46 --> 489.65999999999997
think also a little in there it was just

485.66 --> 491.46000000000004
interesting except for man super cliche

489.66 --> 493.97900000000004
like okay yeah yeah yeah

491.46 --> 497.34
go away

493.979 --> 501.5
and as for the

497.34 --> 501.5
in the movie itself it seemed

504.18 --> 509.40000000000003
right that that's what was said about it

507.72 --> 511.44000000000005
from the reviewers too like there's not

509.4 --> 513.36
enough drama in it it's I almost have to

511.44 --> 516.779
agree with that

513.36 --> 518.94
that it's like everybody is too serious

516.779 --> 521.519
like there is no

518.94 --> 524.94
there's almost no just spontaneous

521.519 --> 527.58
personal character manifestation because

524.94 --> 529.7600000000001
everybody's so freaking serious all the

527.58 --> 529.76
time

531.42 --> 536.459
like they should have

533.94 --> 538.44
there were like hints of it like weird

536.459 --> 541.14
like okay they take take sleeping

538.44 --> 542.72
medication for example like that's

541.14 --> 545.64
actually

542.72 --> 547.6800000000001
interesting they just didn't elaborate

545.64 --> 549.36
anything about it because it could have

547.68 --> 550.62
been said like yeah they take sleeping

549.36 --> 552.74
medication because they have trouble

550.62 --> 557.339
sleeping because it's

552.74 --> 561.1800000000001
really tough being like a lord

557.339 --> 563.82
with your family in the tough spot

561.18 --> 566.3389999999999
in danger constantly and you're like

563.82 --> 568.5600000000001
worrying about everybody and that will

566.339 --> 571.22
typically make you Sleepless right they

568.56 --> 571.2199999999999
should have like

571.8 --> 577.399
emphasize that a little more to give it

574.2 --> 581.7
more character to also basically

577.399 --> 584.88
justify the seriousness a bit from it

581.7 --> 588.72
right they should it's like it was

584.88 --> 590.1
almost perfect but it wasn't it's

588.72 --> 592.8000000000001
difficult

590.1 --> 595.339
right but overall still very impressed

592.8 --> 595.3389999999999
also

599.459 --> 606.06
yeah

601.5 --> 609.079
fremin were done excellent excellent

606.06 --> 612.2399999999999
much much better than like the original

609.079 --> 614.519
movie The First One

612.24 --> 616.62
the fremin in that

614.519 --> 619.68
right there's so much more culture

616.62 --> 621.66
injected into the whole thing

619.68 --> 624.1999999999999
so yeah I've been very was very

621.66 --> 624.1999999999999
impressed

624.36 --> 627.36
overall

627.72 --> 632.1
also I think that like the character

629.94 --> 635.0400000000001
that plays po at tradies is is probably

632.1 --> 638.0
the best portrayal

635.04 --> 638.0
thus far

638.22 --> 642.779
I'm really curious how he's gonna do in

640.68 --> 645.2399999999999
the follow-up movie

642.779 --> 648.36
I thought it was really doing great

645.24 --> 651.779
and I also thought that the entire spy

648.36 --> 654.42
sensation and like the vision things

651.779 --> 656.459
they were really well done

654.42 --> 659.579
like they were

656.459 --> 662.579
just you know the people that if like

659.579 --> 664.5
written that have had some experiences

662.579 --> 668.3599999999999
with like

664.5 --> 668.36
probably Ayahuasca and such

668.519 --> 673.94
so yeah overall very impressive not

671.579 --> 673.9399999999999
perfect

674.7 --> 678.44
but definitely good enough

679.74 --> 683.0
right uh hello

683.399 --> 688.44
moon buggy Mike zidunich Nathan Oakley

687.12 --> 692.779
1980

688.44 --> 692.7790000000001
sent me a PayPal donation all right okay

693.0 --> 698.42
cool thanks didn't know you could afford

696.12 --> 698.42
that

707.04 --> 711.14
hmm

708.12 --> 711.14
thank you very much

712.5 --> 715.399
it's very generous

733.139 --> 737.519
you can't very poor sure you are too

735.66 --> 745.079
though yeah

737.519 --> 748.5600000000001
well not in this precise moment but yeah

745.079 --> 751.68
as the month progresses everybody knows

748.56 --> 754.38
that I eventually do kind of run out

751.68 --> 758.16
that's why I preemptively whenever I

754.38 --> 760.74
feel inspiration for it dude try to ask

758.16 --> 762.7199999999999
for donations before it gets to that

760.74 --> 765.12
point so then

762.72 --> 768.5400000000001
yeah while that happens I'm not so

765.12 --> 770.88
distracted by money troubles worries

768.54 --> 774.079
because that does distract me but yeah

770.88 --> 774.079
thank you very much Nathan

779.579 --> 784.019
oh yeah I asked a trillion I don't know

781.98 --> 786.0600000000001
who is trillion

784.019 --> 788.66
slow mo Moon bug you have no idea what

786.06 --> 788.66

795.12 --> 802.44
show got a lot of flack

798.42 --> 803.579
got a lot of well it seems like Angry

802.44 --> 806.7
comments

803.579 --> 808.5
very quickly also got a lot of views

806.7 --> 812.399
so I think that

808.5 --> 814.56
like the arwyn fans let's just call them

812.399 --> 816.48
that probably been spreading right oh

814.56 --> 820.279
look what arwen's doing now again all

816.48 --> 820.279
right so homophobic again

820.56 --> 824.899
because I got a lot of views very

822.42 --> 824.899
quickly

826.139 --> 829.339
to add some comments

830.399 --> 834.899
yeah no PayPal donations by the way

832.68 --> 836.519
which is a

834.899 --> 839.279
yeah

836.519 --> 842.72
well I got some from Nathan right now so

839.279 --> 842.72
yeah for now you're not gay

842.76 --> 845.72
appreciate that

848.88 --> 853.98
oh Adam gave you a projector whoa

855.24 --> 859.32
awesome

857.76 --> 861.8
lucky guy

859.32 --> 861.8000000000001
huh

870.839 --> 876.6600000000001
right yeah I noticed you had a call on

873.6 --> 880.019
Skype with the guys but I was

876.66 --> 882.7199999999999
like in the middle of something

880.019 --> 885.92
also to be fair yesterday I really did

882.72 --> 885.9200000000001
not feel good at all

887.699 --> 894.74
and and of course it's very obvious well

890.639 --> 894.74
sort of obvious to me why it's because

894.839 --> 899.5790000000001
yeah didn't get enough sleep I tried to

897.839 --> 901.5600000000001
sleep a little like

899.579 --> 905.699
somewhere in the evening

901.56 --> 910.8199999999999
but overall I was just like my organs

905.699 --> 910.8199999999999
did not feel great so I had like this

911.399 --> 915.72
an ease

913.26 --> 919.079
but I did go to bed

915.72 --> 921.6
at a decent time at least

919.079 --> 925.2199999999999
so today I'm well rested I don't feel

921.6 --> 925.22
like that anymore like I did yesterday

925.5 --> 930.5
oh yeah I took a shower also that helped

932.04 --> 934.639
huh

943.079 --> 948.42
all right Nathan thanks for the update

945.24 --> 951.72

953.699 --> 957.199
so the show can move on

959.94 --> 965.1600000000001

962.399 --> 966.54
yesterday because Wednesday's show was

965.16 --> 969.06
really good

966.54 --> 972.139
I'm very much looking forward to seeing

969.06 --> 972.1389999999999
that back in the premieres

993.6 --> 997.279
hello Tasmanian truther

1006.86 --> 1011.0

1008.899 --> 1012.38

right

1012.38 --> 1018.04
like what's that little thing

1015.38 --> 1018.04
anyway

1019.339 --> 1022.94
yeah this minty thing is working out

1021.68 --> 1025.28
really well

1022.94 --> 1026.959
I don't know who gave me the tip like a

1025.28 --> 1030.319
few days ago but it was a really good

1026.959 --> 1032.179
one and I do drink my green tea still

1030.319 --> 1034.28
but I'd kind of do that now in the

1032.179 --> 1037.16
evening

1034.28 --> 1040.48
because yeah in this early time

1037.16 --> 1044.02
the green tea is just doing meat yeah

1040.48 --> 1044.02
it's doing better

1044.12 --> 1050.78
it doesn't like

1046.16 --> 1053.679
up the tension and I like that now it's

1050.78 --> 1053.6789999999999
very useful

1060.98 --> 1064.9
um

1062.12 --> 1068.6
right so any any commentary any

1064.9 --> 1072.8600000000001
Reflections on yesterday and my

1068.6 --> 1075.28
gay ranting I am anti it's not even anti

1072.86 --> 1075.28
it's just

1078.799 --> 1085.46
my struggle with the gay

1081.14 --> 1086.96
is really the Mind Control part of it

1085.46 --> 1089.8400000000001
because

1086.96 --> 1091.64
yeah you want to be gay that's that's

1089.84 --> 1093.5
just fine you know it's your freaking

1091.64 --> 1096.26
life you're gonna have to deal with the

1093.5 --> 1098.539
consequences of it

1096.26 --> 1101.12
I just

1098.539 --> 1104.419
I really resent

1101.12 --> 1107.299
it when it's normalized

1104.419 --> 1109.7
and then it's like oh everybody turns

1107.299 --> 1114.2
gay eventually right that's the part

1109.7 --> 1116.8400000000001
that's that's been really forced on me

1114.2 --> 1121.039
in the first half of my life

1116.84 --> 1123.32
and that has left me with a lot of

1121.039 --> 1125.36
resentment and anger

1123.32 --> 1128.24
right that's the part I'm mostly angry

1125.36 --> 1133.4599999999998
about it's the Shameless

1128.24 --> 1137.9
this and the mind control part but

1133.46 --> 1141.14
12 K identifies a black woman

1137.9 --> 1146.38
okay yeah yeah fine

1141.14 --> 1146.38
joke around about it will ya Nathan

1160.88 --> 1165.0390000000002
but yeah got I can't I'm getting a lot

1163.34 --> 1168.02
of comments from

1165.039 --> 1170.299
anti-flat earthers and Ballers and like

1168.02 --> 1171.2
even people that have used to watch the

1170.299 --> 1173.78
show

1171.2 --> 1175.28
or used to be in chat they're all so

1173.78 --> 1178.8799999999999
pissed off at me

1175.28 --> 1179.539
it's like people are really angry butt

1178.88 --> 1183.4
hurt

1179.539 --> 1183.4
for me Banning them for some reason

1195.919 --> 1200.44
yeah clutch

1197.9 --> 1200.44
yeah

1204.64 --> 1211.88
to be fair I'm

1208.4 --> 1213.38
I'm worse I kind of want it's like no

1211.88 --> 1216.0800000000002
keep it a secret

1213.38 --> 1219.0200000000002
like I don't want to be confronted about

1216.08 --> 1222.32
anything about it keep it a secret right

1219.02 --> 1225.559
oh how dare you are when eh

1222.32 --> 1229.22
what you want to go back to oh when it

1225.559 --> 1232.58
was all secret and yeah yeah do go back

1229.22 --> 1235.7
go back right it's probably better for

1232.58 --> 1237.3799999999999
you anyway because then you don't roll

1235.7 --> 1239.96
down the hill

1237.38 --> 1244.659
so fast

1239.96 --> 1244.659
if you just keep it all secret

1250.4 --> 1254.44
like I just don't want to know about it

1270.86 --> 1276.559
what she what I didn't even know that

1274.4 --> 1279.039

right

1469.64 --> 1474.679
you can check my comment section from

1472.88 --> 1479.2

um

1555.44 --> 1563.14
oh yeah by the way congratulations to

1558.02 --> 1563.1399999999999
Italy for rejecting gay hate crime bill

1563.36 --> 1566.74
that did pop up

1569.779 --> 1573.039
but how gay are you

1574.94 --> 1577.96
hello Cleary

1581.72 --> 1589.7
have I seen anything on auto detects I

1586.4 --> 1592.039
what I don't know who that is

1589.7 --> 1595.0
Chico

1592.039 --> 1595.0
Tu yay

1596.299 --> 1602.44
but tartaria

1599.24 --> 1602.44
oh what about it

1609.38 --> 1613.7
wondering who is behind creation of our

1612.32 --> 1617.8999999999999
world

1613.7 --> 1619.159
pressured system we live in well

1617.9 --> 1622.48
God

1619.159 --> 1622.48
the great designer

1622.82 --> 1625.8799999999999
right

1624.26 --> 1628.34
I think

1625.88 --> 1630.2600000000002
into the future

1628.34 --> 1633.5
this is this is also a dark World

1630.26 --> 1636.32
reflected it's so standardized

1633.5 --> 1639.5
that I've been accepting that for a long

1636.32 --> 1642.32
time it's just that I couldn't find any

1639.5 --> 1644.299
grip out there in the world just yet so

1642.32 --> 1645.799
this is another Armenian too soon

1644.299 --> 1647.96
prediction right

1645.799 --> 1652.22
I think it's going to be universally

1647.96 --> 1655.82
understood there has to be a creator

1652.22 --> 1658.52
and I think that the atheist fantasists

1655.82 --> 1661.1
that imagine that there isn't any

1658.52 --> 1664.34
are going to have to concede at some

1661.1 --> 1668.299
point just to stay stable

1664.34 --> 1671.899
yeah but what's gonna happen

1668.299 --> 1675.74
what's gonna happen right because they

1671.899 --> 1677.779
wanna still be free

1675.74 --> 1679.76
so what's gonna happen is there's gonna

1677.779 --> 1683.919
be a split

1679.76 --> 1683.919
in the understanding of a creator

1684.74 --> 1688.22
two factions

1686.419 --> 1690.74
one

1688.22 --> 1693.5
says the Creator he's right there he's

1690.74 --> 1696.6200000000001
on the throne

1693.5 --> 1700.52
we get our information directly from him

1696.62 --> 1703.9399999999998
the other is going to say he's dead

1700.52 --> 1706.58
the designer has left or has died as

1703.94 --> 1710.5
abandoned is no longer there but it was

1706.58 --> 1710.5
designed but he's not there

1715.76 --> 1721.76
right that's gonna replace the atheistic

1719.24 --> 1724.279
mindset because they have to concede it

1721.76 --> 1726.44
is designed it's not

1724.279 --> 1727.82
it's not no longer a debate it's about

1726.44 --> 1731.8600000000001
as

1727.82 --> 1731.86
to say that there was no designer

1731.899 --> 1737.059
is like dumber than saying that the

1734.659 --> 1740.5
Earth is a sphere

1737.059 --> 1743.96
because you'll find it in everything

1740.5 --> 1745.64
literally the very substance which we

1743.96 --> 1748.52
are comprised

1745.64 --> 1751.279
everything proves there is a designer

1748.52 --> 1752.84
but there might be it eventually we

1751.279 --> 1755.12
might end up with a split a

1752.84 --> 1757.6999999999998
philosophical split between those that

1755.12 --> 1760.1
say the Creator the designer he's right

1757.7 --> 1763.3990000000001
there he's on the throne right now

1760.1 --> 1765.62
through the other side communicating

1763.399 --> 1768.9189999999999
and there will be those that say yeah

1765.62 --> 1770.84
yeah it was designed but he's not there

1768.919 --> 1774.3200000000002
he's dead or something

1770.84 --> 1775.58
right like even start to tie in like

1774.32 --> 1779.48
maybe

1775.58 --> 1782.6
Jesus Christ dying was actually God

1779.48 --> 1785.96
himself like he had I I've even like

1782.6 --> 1788.6
forwarded this idea like a year ago

1785.96 --> 1791.299
in just a short moment

1788.6 --> 1793.34
like what if the Creator actually did

1791.299 --> 1797.32
walk this world and then he figured out

1793.34 --> 1797.32
I'm I'm going to remove myself

1797.38 --> 1804.0200000000002
to allow room for more development more

1801.98 --> 1806.179
learning more experience more challenge

1804.02 --> 1807.62
for the people

1806.179 --> 1810.98
and that

1807.62 --> 1813.26
the Creator once physically seated in

1810.98 --> 1816.2
this world basically allowed himself to

1813.26 --> 1820.82
be killed by those that opposed him

1816.2 --> 1822.679
to usher in the next phase of human

1820.82 --> 1825.08
development

1822.679 --> 1828.3200000000002
sounds really bizarre right and that

1825.08 --> 1830.48
will probably then be the root of the

1828.32 --> 1833.08
conviction that the Creator designer is

1830.48 --> 1833.08
actually dead

1833.179 --> 1839.6000000000001
so that's my prediction I wonder if

1836.72 --> 1842.08
anybody here is ever going to remember

1839.6 --> 1842.08
that

1849.679 --> 1855.52
another God just offered him a good

1852.26 --> 1855.52
price for what the hell

1862.58 --> 1865.24
no

1872.419 --> 1877.8200000000002
but then again yeah

1875.299 --> 1880.22
if you're going to consider that the

1877.82 --> 1881.72
Creator is dead then you might

1880.22 --> 1885.559
right

1881.72 --> 1889.3990000000001
because there might have been actual

1885.559 --> 1892.1
like sons of God Little G's the the

1889.399 --> 1895.9399999999998
pantheon type gods

1892.1 --> 1898.399
and maybe their Spirit still lingers

1895.94 --> 1900.74
but they might have been living

1898.399 --> 1904.7199999999998
and then entangled in all these stories

1900.74 --> 1904.72
right there might have been like the

1906.32 --> 1909.9189999999999
it's called again Elohim

1910.64 --> 1917.0590000000002
which could have basically taken on the

1914.0 --> 1920.74
rulership of the Earth

1917.059 --> 1920.74
and then it involves in that

1923.24 --> 1928.159
but anyhow I just thought it I thought

1926.0 --> 1930.7
it would worth emphasizing in the future

1928.159 --> 1930.7
like

1932.0 --> 1938.62
atheism is just like it's gonna falter

1935.72 --> 1938.6200000000001
it's like

1939.019 --> 1944.36
it will ha it will be recognized that

1941.72 --> 1947.6000000000001
there has to be a creator

1944.36 --> 1950.299
there has to have been a Creator and

1947.6 --> 1953.899
there's no escaping from that and thus

1950.299 --> 1956.6589999999999
the philosophy will then re-polarize

1953.899 --> 1958.6999999999998
around the idea he's still there he's

1956.659 --> 1960.919
right there on the throne we're

1958.7 --> 1963.159
communicating with him he gives us our

1960.919 --> 1963.159
ideas

1963.2 --> 1968.72
and

1965.12 --> 1971.059
no he's not actually there he's dead or

1968.72 --> 1974.32
gone but we are still left with his

1971.059 --> 1974.32
Echoes through the design

1975.32 --> 1980.84
and like a false hope that we can

1977.48 --> 1983.24
overcome the design right which is what

1980.84 --> 1987.98
like the the luciferians are trying to

1983.24 --> 1990.98
do like reshape it in their ideas

1987.98 --> 1994.0
to get rid of all those pesky Gods

1990.98 --> 1994.0
design laws

1996.26 --> 2003.22
about lies and about being gay and you

1999.919 --> 2007.44
know that all that for Michaela

2003.22 --> 2007.44
to bypass that so that's what I thought

2008.46 --> 2012.419
now that's another concept

2013.72 --> 2021.0
like I don't know if you know but the

2015.58 --> 2021.0
Nephilim are pre-definition cross breeds

2021.46 --> 2025.919
Nephilim are not original creatures

2027.46 --> 2035.019
they're even biblically they're supposed

2030.22 --> 2037.299
to be the off Spring not original off

2035.019 --> 2040.96
Spring

2037.299 --> 2043.72
of supposed fallen angels

2040.96 --> 2046.6000000000001
whatever that was

2043.72 --> 2048.82
and man right the Fallen Angels might

2046.6 --> 2051.04
simply have been

2048.82 --> 2054.8790000000004
the sons of God

2051.04 --> 2057.04
like the pantheon the really powerful

2054.879 --> 2058.2999999999997
original creatures that have probably

2057.04 --> 2060.399
helped

2058.3 --> 2064.48
that yeah ruled Earth in the early age

2060.399 --> 2067.06
that went completely evil right Fallen

2064.48 --> 2069.94
they were originally powerful as angels

2067.06 --> 2073.599
and like gods they would have been seen

2069.94 --> 2075.639
as gods and then they fell spiritually

2073.599 --> 2078.099
and then they might have tried to

2075.639 --> 2080.02
cross-breed with humans

2078.099 --> 2082.3
and that could have turned into the

2080.02 --> 2086.44
Nephilim but they're not original the

2082.3 --> 2088.48
Elohim are supposedly The Originals

2086.44 --> 2091.26
like even in

2088.48 --> 2091.26
uh

2091.74 --> 2098.8199999999997
what's it in Genesis right that's that

2096.099 --> 2098.82
Elohim

2100.78 --> 2103.6800000000003
multiple

2116.5 --> 2120.0
okay Nathan's not funny

2123.64 --> 2126.96
you're in a weird mood today

2127.839 --> 2130.02
foreign

2130.92 --> 2136.859
the programming in Shira probably got to

2134.2 --> 2136.859
you Nathan

2145.599 --> 2151.44
title not many was my understanding well

2148.48 --> 2151.44
it wasn't mine

2181.72 --> 2186.48
you're just stressed out why why are you

2184.0 --> 2186.48
stressed out

2188.38 --> 2192.839
I mean you got your setup fixed right

2220.18 --> 2225.24
hmm

2221.56 --> 2225.24
okay Cleary interesting

2238.54 --> 2244.18
um right well clutch look

2241.3 --> 2245.26
technically the Elohim it's not really

2244.18 --> 2247.8999999999996
relevant

2245.26 --> 2251.26
if there was one or if it was multiple

2247.9 --> 2256.48
because later there were sons of God not

2251.26 --> 2258.1600000000003
Sun Sons multiple so there is multiple

2256.48 --> 2259.26
right there might have been one original

2258.16 --> 2261.7
God

2259.26 --> 2264.0
manifestation a physical manifestation

2261.7 --> 2267.7599999999998
or there might have been original

2264.0 --> 2270.339
physical multiple manifestations

2267.76 --> 2272.8590000000004
it's not really relevant but it's pretty

2270.339 --> 2275.859
certain that there were multiple

2272.859 --> 2275.859
offspring

2285.099 --> 2290.4
just trying to explain it's a kind of

2287.56 --> 2290.4
fine clutch

2301.06 --> 2305.04
the bill will be stressful oh

2305.619 --> 2308.2200000000003
okay

2308.32 --> 2313.9
but are you sure that it's even

2310.24 --> 2316.9599999999996
repairable Nathan most times from what

2313.9 --> 2318.52
I've heard because one of my friends

2316.96 --> 2320.8
that I haven't really has not really

2318.52 --> 2322.06
friend anymore he was into projectors as

2320.8 --> 2325.119
well

2322.06 --> 2327.94
and he explained to me that yeah once it

2325.119 --> 2330.94
breaks you just gotta chug it in the bin

2327.94 --> 2335.28
because once they break just buy a new

2330.94 --> 2339.339
one they like run out

2335.28 --> 2341.6800000000003
entropy is like they're very projectors

2339.339 --> 2343.72
are seriously prone to entropy let's

2341.68 --> 2346.54
just say it like that

2343.72 --> 2350.04
like they just degenerate and then they

2346.54 --> 2350.04
can't be revived again so

2353.02 --> 2359.7599999999998
I'm distressing you okay

2355.44 --> 2359.76
de-stressing not distressing good

2382.3 --> 2388.6600000000003
well you were yeah

2385.48 --> 2391.38
may need your place damn that's so

2388.66 --> 2391.3799999999997
expensive man

2392.98 --> 2396.42
yeah it's crazy

2407.98 --> 2412.56
yeah Bobby you're not welcome here

2410.319 --> 2412.56
anymore

2431.46 --> 2440.7
oh God sterndino is spamming [ __ ]

2436.96 --> 2440.7
yeah get out

2447.52 --> 2451.74
all right uh okay

2453.28 --> 2459.579
right since he is gonna spam I

2456.76 --> 2461.619
recommended just one person

2459.579 --> 2462.819
takes care of it because yeah if you all

2461.619 --> 2465.04
ban it

2462.819 --> 2467.2599999999998
then he gets banned unbanned banned

2465.04 --> 2470.079
unbanned it's like the very stupid

2467.26 --> 2473.38
system Google

2470.079 --> 2476.619
like tell me when that was ever supposed

2473.38 --> 2478.54
to work like that it's really stupid to

2476.619 --> 2481.54
make it work like that

2478.54 --> 2483.64
right have the ban and unban in a

2481.54 --> 2486.16
separate slider don't

2483.64 --> 2488.68
have it automatically

2486.16 --> 2491.3799999999997
as soon as somebody is banned then in

2488.68 --> 2494.6189999999997
the same code entry

2491.38 --> 2497.26
do the unban it's the stupid design

2494.619 --> 2500.02
decision to do it like that you have to

2497.26 --> 2503.2000000000003
have it in a separate entry

2500.02 --> 2505.48
or exactly what happens happens

2503.2 --> 2508.5989999999997
people like oh three people are gonna

2505.48 --> 2514.0
four people are gonna ban somebody

2508.599 --> 2517.3590000000004
and it's been unban unban uh yeah sucks

2514.0 --> 2521.319
it's a very basic

2517.359 --> 2524.38
design problem interface problem can be

2521.319 --> 2528.52
very easily fixed it's a very easy tweak

2524.38 --> 2532.119
and it fix it all but yet it's like this

2528.52 --> 2534.9
for years having the same problems over

2532.119 --> 2534.9
and over again

2541.96 --> 2547.78
all right Nathan yeah thanks for popping

2544.3 --> 2550.7400000000002
by good luck I'll see you in the uh

2547.78 --> 2550.7400000000002
Flat Earth debate

2567.7 --> 2572.3999999999996
about the same as AOL in the 90s well

2574.119 --> 2580.359
they do screw around with it right

2578.02 --> 2583.78
it's just I don't understand why they're

2580.359 --> 2587.319
not thinking it through better

2583.78 --> 2590.8
right massive interactions

2587.319 --> 2594.16
they they should know how to improve it

2590.8 --> 2596.44
like I literally just immediately

2594.16 --> 2599.859
brought a solution

2596.44 --> 2603.579
and probably for some

2599.859 --> 2607.7799999999997
editor of the system the YouTube system

2603.579 --> 2610.9
to correct that would maybe

2607.78 --> 2613.7200000000003
like at the actual programming would be

2610.9 --> 2617.6800000000003
probably five minutes and then yeah

2613.72 --> 2619.839
there would be the after phase and bug

2617.68 --> 2622.66
correlating it with the rest right and

2619.839 --> 2623.74
that'll probably take like a couple of

2622.66 --> 2626.0789999999997
hours

2623.74 --> 2629.2599999999998
to get it all sorted out

2626.079 --> 2631.8390000000004
but it's so basic to just make that

2629.26 --> 2634.3590000000004
little change it literally doesn't cost

2631.839 --> 2638.02
anything to change it for the better it

2634.359 --> 2642.18
doesn't cost anything it's really stupid

2638.02 --> 2642.18
and inefficient not to do it

2642.7 --> 2645.5989999999997
YouTube

2649.18 --> 2655.1189999999997
and while you're at it bring the the

2651.52 --> 2656.8
damn check Channel option back

2655.119 --> 2658.98
for moderators

2656.8 --> 2661.7200000000003
or at least for channel owners not

2658.98 --> 2663.16
moderators Maybe not maybe you want to

2661.72 --> 2667.3799999999997
keep that out

2663.16 --> 2667.3799999999997
but for channel owners come on

2667.42 --> 2673.119
it's it is preposterous that as a

2669.819 --> 2675.819
channel owner you cannot actually check

2673.119 --> 2678.1600000000003
who is visiting your chat

2675.819 --> 2680.56
that you can't Source them for their

2678.16 --> 2682.5989999999997
yeah

2680.56 --> 2685.9
their account that you can check it out

2682.599 --> 2689.1600000000003
is really insane that you took that away

2685.9 --> 2689.1600000000003
really bad

2689.38 --> 2695.44
because now the chat is prone to troll

2693.22 --> 2697.72
manipulation they just they can do

2695.44 --> 2699.579
whatever they want they can pretend to

2697.72 --> 2702.24
be somebody else that you haven't seen

2699.579 --> 2702.2400000000002
in a long time

2703.66 --> 2709.48
and even plant false information

2706.9 --> 2712.319
because you can check

2709.48 --> 2715.06
if the account is actually the person

2712.319 --> 2720.359
you can't check it anymore

2715.06 --> 2720.359
very bad decision from YouTube

2732.72 --> 2736.319
I've heard that

2736.839 --> 2744.0
but I don't understand because I thought

2739.18 --> 2744.0
that JB Jedi died like a year ago

2744.28 --> 2749.98
at actually asking around and all that

2747.7 --> 2751.4199999999996
but maybe that was a weird fake out that

2749.98 --> 2755.76
it could have been a weird fake out

2751.42 --> 2755.76
because trolls do that sometimes

2756.579 --> 2762.48
but yeah

2758.44 --> 2762.48
I guess I must have Mendel at it

2775.18 --> 2780.54
the Mendel effect yeah exactly clutch

2777.94 --> 2780.54
you get it

2782.56 --> 2788.04
no I'm not dressing up for Halloween I

2784.96 --> 2788.04
don't dress up for anything

2794.14 --> 2799.319
yeah clutch yeah that's now that's

2796.3 --> 2799.319
called synchronicity

2802.359 --> 2806.2599999999998
because I take it you typed it before

2804.04 --> 2808.74
you heard me say it

2806.26 --> 2808.7400000000002
uh

2822.28 --> 2824.46
foreign

2826.42 --> 2832.119
yeah and by the way I don't celebrate

2828.76 --> 2835.5
Halloween I just don't do that

2832.119 --> 2835.5
I don't really like Halloween

2839.56 --> 2843.359
because it's the wrong time for me

2843.819 --> 2848.619
I get issues

2846.339 --> 2851.319
with my mood and all that and extra

2848.619 --> 2852.7000000000003
sensitivity and then having like hahaha

2851.319 --> 2856.98
Let's

2852.7 --> 2856.98
be pretend evil and

2857.2 --> 2862.7799999999997
like I don't like it like if it would be

2859.96 --> 2865.7200000000003
in another time period in the year I'd

2862.78 --> 2868.5400000000004
probably enjoy it a lot more

2865.72 --> 2869.7999999999997
because yeah I

2868.54 --> 2872.859
I mean

2869.8 --> 2875.98
I got into Gothic and I kind of I think

2872.859 --> 2879.16
it's interesting but if every time it

2875.98 --> 2881.859
comes around I feel bad then it's not a

2879.16 --> 2885.359
lot of fun for me and it doesn't work as

2881.859 --> 2885.359
a distraction it doesn't

2888.94 --> 2893.8
scared of no I'm not scared of pumpkins

2891.28 --> 2897.52
I'm not scared of anything

2893.8 --> 2902.26
but things like jump scares

2897.52 --> 2905.14
is really bad impact on me like

2902.26 --> 2907.599
like that can physically hurt

2905.14 --> 2909.7
so I I'm not like whoa let's watch

2907.599 --> 2912.599
horror movies it's the time of the year

2909.7 --> 2912.5989999999997
no thanks

2929.92 --> 2936.099
is it a thing you where you are no no

2934.78 --> 2937.599
clutch

2936.099 --> 2940.839
I mean

2937.599 --> 2944.319
it's just as much a thing out here as

2940.839 --> 2947.099
Christmas is so that means it's mostly

2944.319 --> 2947.099
a

2948.22 --> 2951.48
they call it like a a corporate thing

2950.319 --> 2954.94
now yeah

2951.48 --> 2957.52
I guess it is Corporate so it is like oh

2954.94 --> 2960.9
look it's Halloween time or oh it's

2957.52 --> 2960.9
Christmas or Easter right

2965.76 --> 2971.079
but there's no like tradition that

2968.559 --> 2974.02
people go out for trick-or-treating

2971.079 --> 2976.6600000000003
I mean there might be a couple of

2974.02 --> 2979.2599999999998
communities here and there where they do

2976.66 --> 2979.2599999999998
do that

2980.38 --> 2983.26
but

2981.76 --> 2985.7200000000003
in general

2983.26 --> 2987.8190000000004
in the Netherlands no it's not like an

2985.72 --> 2989.319
official thing that everybody wants to

2987.819 --> 2991.96
do

2989.319 --> 2993.22
like for example Carnival is right and

2991.96 --> 2994.9
especially in the south of the

2993.22 --> 2997.9599999999996
Netherlands there's this whole Carnival

2994.9 --> 2999.52
thing now that's that's like the Dutch

2997.96 --> 3002.7
Halloween

2999.52 --> 3005.78
thing then that is dress-up time and

3002.7 --> 3005.7799999999997
parades and

3006.599 --> 3010.94
yeah

3008.339 --> 3013.2599999999998
getting a bit naughty and all that

3010.94 --> 3015.7200000000003
pranksterationists and all that yeah but

3013.26 --> 3018.2400000000002
that's that's the Dutch and they take

3015.72 --> 3021.98
that very serious there's like

3018.24 --> 3021.9799999999996
yeah well as I said parades

3022.26 --> 3025.92
that's the south of the Netherlands but

3023.88 --> 3028.38
we don't we don't have any Halloween

3025.92 --> 3031.2000000000003
traditions we don't have any Christmas

3028.38 --> 3033.96
traditions I mean we they're still gonna

3031.2 --> 3035.819
be the lights out there it's gonna still

3033.96 --> 3038.76
gonna be Christmas trees but there's no

3035.819 --> 3041.48
like official

3038.76 --> 3041.48
thing

3043.319 --> 3049.319
right Christmas dinner

3045.66 --> 3052.44
we do do that there is the holidays

3049.319 --> 3055.98
but it's not like big local

3052.44 --> 3058.26
we have Carnival we have Center Classen

3055.98 --> 3060.7400000000002
which is much earlier in the month of

3058.26 --> 3060.7400000000002
December

3062.94 --> 3069.839
right Santa Claus is actually more like

3066.0 --> 3073.02
sinter classes [ __ ] cousin

3069.839 --> 3077.7599999999998
younger cousin much much younger

3073.02 --> 3080.88
because Center Classen is very old

3077.76 --> 3083.4
Christmas not so old like the Santa

3080.88 --> 3085.559
Claus the Coca-Cola man

3083.4 --> 3089.48
because they pretty much invented His

3085.559 --> 3093.059
Image like that's a 20th century

3089.48 --> 3096.359
invention do you even realize right

3093.059 --> 3099.9
could say that Santa Claus is probably

3096.359 --> 3103.7
the same age as the globe

3099.9 --> 3103.7000000000003
isn't that just a crazy idea

3117.9 --> 3120.9
hmm

3152.28 --> 3159.6600000000003
would be a glober for Halloween

3156.24 --> 3162.72
that is actually kind of funny Cleary

3159.66 --> 3165.1189999999997
that is funny yeah

3162.72 --> 3168.54
if you're gonna dress up in Halloween

3165.119 --> 3172.1400000000003
dress up like a scientist

3168.54 --> 3174.48
white lab coat pencil glasses on

3172.14 --> 3177.02
and

3174.48 --> 3177.02
yeah

3177.3 --> 3182.6400000000003
fake scientist

3179.52 --> 3187.099
a blabbermouth scientist guy

3182.64 --> 3187.0989999999997
it's very easy very recognizable

3187.74 --> 3191.2799999999997
right and you could use it for all kinds

3189.599 --> 3194.9
of things it's just

3191.28 --> 3194.9
you could say oh yeah I'm

3196.2 --> 3200.52
I'm a medical scientist for The Advisory

3198.66 --> 3203.7
Board of fauci or something right

3200.52 --> 3205.98
there's so many bad scientists right now

3203.7 --> 3211.02
it's it you could use that as a

3205.98 --> 3214.94
Halloween costume it's Globe medical it

3211.02 --> 3214.94
will be hilarious why not

3216.74 --> 3222.2999999999997
evil scientist well yeah but

3220.5 --> 3224.099
yeah that would require a little bit

3222.3 --> 3226.319
more work

3224.099 --> 3227.76
and you have to have the thick eyebrows

3226.319 --> 3231.5
and

3227.76 --> 3231.5
I don't know other things

3231.72 --> 3237.319
but just

3233.64 --> 3237.319
like a scientist

3244.319 --> 3248.72
dress up as a globe

3249.66 --> 3254.22
so you're going to take like one of

3251.64 --> 3257.16
those plastic bouncy balls sit in them

3254.22 --> 3259.52
and then paint the globe Earth on them

3257.16 --> 3259.52
or something

3261.24 --> 3266.04
you know if you're gonna dress up like

3262.92 --> 3268.079
that you are going to like end up with a

3266.04 --> 3270.9
flattened Globe like it's gonna get

3268.079 --> 3274.28
punctured it's gonna go flat you know

3270.9 --> 3274.28
it's gonna happen from the grave

3303.78 --> 3306.619
foreign

3313.579 --> 3320.099
watching oh oh I did I got

3317.119 --> 3323.099
54 downvotes though

3320.099 --> 3324.599
seems I got pretty got a lot of

3323.099 --> 3326.819
attention actually

3324.599 --> 3327.78
right my the viewers might not reflect

3326.819 --> 3330.24
it

3327.78 --> 3333.7400000000002
then again you know it's way too early

3330.24 --> 3333.74
really in the United States

3336.96 --> 3344.28
I mean there are the real early birds

3341.819 --> 3346.14
and yeah that's what my show is kind of

3344.28 --> 3348.559
for that's why it's called flatter the

3346.14 --> 3348.5589999999997
early bird

3350.04 --> 3353.2799999999997
but yeah I'm not gonna get like

3351.78 --> 3355.8590000000004
thousands and thousands of people

3353.28 --> 3358.559
because they're not awake yet

3355.859 --> 3360.7799999999997
right most flat earthers I think

3358.559 --> 3362.4
like just number wise are in the United

3360.78 --> 3364.8590000000004
States

3362.4 --> 3369.319
I'm not getting a lot of those right now

3364.859 --> 3369.319
like they roll in later

3369.72 --> 3374.7
so at that I kind of big missed the big

3372.839 --> 3377.46
waves

3374.7 --> 3379.5899999999997
but yeah

3377.46 --> 3382.649
it is what it is

3379.59 --> 3382.6490000000003
[Music]

3387.24 --> 3393.4199999999996
uh yeah but you're an early wake-up guy

3390.059 --> 3397.3190000000004
clutch right wow five

3393.42 --> 3400.559
past five damn that's really early yeah

3397.319 --> 3402.859
well that's I'm here I'm here for those

3400.559 --> 3402.8590000000004
people

3412.26 --> 3414.44
foreign

3456.599 --> 3460.6800000000003
yeah infinite Loops lost and hello yeah

3459.119 --> 3461.88
of course the UK is a different matter

3460.68 --> 3466.44
but

3461.88 --> 3467.76
there's less people in the UK than in

3466.44 --> 3470.299
the US

3467.76 --> 3470.2990000000004
right

3481.079 --> 3488.8390000000004
but it's okay look I still get plenty of

3484.38 --> 3488.839
watching get plenty of views

3490.26 --> 3497.3590000000004
right and I'm not a super huge Channel

3493.52 --> 3497.359
I'll probably never be

3500.76 --> 3507.7990000000004
maybe I shouldn't be maybe a large

3504.24 --> 3507.799
audience just can't handle me

3507.9 --> 3513.7200000000003
and maybe I don't know if I could handle

3510.96 --> 3517.68
a large audience I think I'd actually do

3513.72 --> 3520.2
a lot better than people realize

3517.68 --> 3522.72
because in my mind

3520.2 --> 3524.22
and this is not a joke

3522.72 --> 3528.54
I

3524.22 --> 3531.66
am expecting literally every person in

3528.54 --> 3534.599
the world to be able to see me

3531.66 --> 3537.299
and I even have a weird sensation

3534.599 --> 3539.119
and that's been around for a long time

3537.299 --> 3543.18
like they're actually

3539.119 --> 3545.88
watching me and my activities through my

3543.18 --> 3547.5589999999997
own eyes yeah that sounds really weird I

3545.88 --> 3550.7000000000003
know

3547.559 --> 3550.7000000000003
so I'm just

3551.04 --> 3558.9
like I am ready to be known to be doing

3555.54 --> 3561.24
what I do and saying what I say by

3558.9 --> 3565.04
everyone in the world

3561.24 --> 3569.4599999999996
and add that in a way I am addressing

3565.04 --> 3572.339
everybody in the world

3569.46 --> 3575.4
that's serious I'm addressing everyone

3572.339 --> 3578.339
in the world when I talk

3575.4 --> 3580.44
I'm not like oh I'm just gonna talk to

3578.339 --> 3582.96
this little group right here and and

3580.44 --> 3584.099
just leave it to that and then kind of

3582.96 --> 3586.559
like oh

3584.099 --> 3588.839
we don't have to worry about what the

3586.559 --> 3590.6400000000003
rest thinks I'm just gonna pretend like

3588.839 --> 3592.619
we are isolated even though I'm doing

3590.64 --> 3595.2599999999998
live streams that everybody should be

3592.619 --> 3596.76
able to technically see

3595.26 --> 3600.0
no

3596.76 --> 3602.28
I address the world

3600.0 --> 3604.079
and I addressed more narrowed down

3602.28 --> 3606.42
groups

3604.079 --> 3609.299
but I'm always expecting that literally

3606.42 --> 3612.0
everyone in the world

3609.299 --> 3614.099
in all directions is

3612.0 --> 3616.68
aware about me

3614.099 --> 3619.559
directly or indirectly

3616.68 --> 3621.18
and I have strong weird sensation as

3619.559 --> 3623.8190000000004
well that

3621.18 --> 3625.64
I do have influence even though when I

3623.819 --> 3629.7599999999998
try to

3625.64 --> 3631.3799999999997
grab it and grab or find the direct

3629.76 --> 3636.6600000000003
connection

3631.38 --> 3639.54
like the proof I can't find it I cannot

3636.66 --> 3643.14
but the synchronicities are are really

3639.54 --> 3646.079
out of control a lot of the times like

3643.14 --> 3650.16
where I just get the sensation like am I

3646.079 --> 3652.88
somehow directing things

3650.16 --> 3652.8799999999997
out there

3653.46 --> 3656.299
crazy right

3658.079 --> 3663.48
but then again yeah it gets stuck on

3660.54 --> 3666.299
like a feedback loop like either I am

3663.48 --> 3667.5
directing the world out there or I am so

3666.299 --> 3670.559
attuned

3667.5 --> 3672.66
that the world is that I am just the

3670.559 --> 3674.94
reflection of what's actually happening

3672.66 --> 3677.22
in the world and maybe even a reflection

3674.94 --> 3678.48
before it happens

3677.22 --> 3681.5989999999997
but

3678.48 --> 3684.299
as for how I experience it it really

3681.599 --> 3687.0
does seem sometimes like I am

3684.299 --> 3690.079
somehow directing the world it's really

3687.0 --> 3690.079
surreal like that

3692.579 --> 3701.52
but it does keep me on track as well it

3696.9 --> 3704.099
makes me take what I do very serious

3701.52 --> 3706.98
and every mistake is like

3704.099 --> 3709.46
a big humiliation like that I'm

3706.98 --> 3709.46
basically

3709.799 --> 3713.88
kind of like

3711.299 --> 3716.22
and yeah

3713.88 --> 3721.52
trying to spiritually take on leadership

3716.22 --> 3721.52
role even though I don't really have it

3723.68 --> 3726.98
officially anyway

3732.48 --> 3739.88
and I think that yeah a lot of people

3735.059 --> 3739.88
definitely wouldn't want me as a leader

3741.0 --> 3744.66
but maybe I'm wrong

3742.74 --> 3746.5789999999997
right

3744.66 --> 3748.799
I

3746.579 --> 3752.1800000000003
for my personal experience vantage point

3748.799 --> 3752.18
just can't size it up

3756.66 --> 3763.3799999999997
Max hello cool feeling making a impact

3760.799 --> 3765.48
what am I making an impact am I actually

3763.38 --> 3768.839
doing that

3765.48 --> 3771.72
right yeah there's measurable things

3768.839 --> 3774.24
that I've put down in the scene I have

3771.72 --> 3777.5989999999997
relevance to the Flat Earth scene I I do

3774.24 --> 3781.2
oh yes I do I know nobody out there can

3777.599 --> 3783.96
tell me that I don't nobody I don't care

3781.2 --> 3786.1189999999997
if you show up with a thousand trolls a

3783.96 --> 3789.2400000000002
thousand Flat Earth trolls

3786.119 --> 3792.2400000000002
doesn't matter I know

3789.24 --> 3794.819
I know I am making an impact I have

3792.24 --> 3797.22
inserted ideas that

3794.819 --> 3800.579
are still relevant to this day that

3797.22 --> 3803.5789999999997
people are still trying to grasp even

3800.579 --> 3805.619
though I've put them down like five

3803.579 --> 3807.8390000000004
years ago

3805.619 --> 3811.44
right when everybody thought I was like

3807.839 --> 3814.98
crazy like BJ well guess what they don't

3811.44 --> 3818.099
think I'm crazy like PT anymore

3814.98 --> 3820.2
because now my ideas are start like

3818.099 --> 3823.2000000000003
everything they have learned is starting

3820.2 --> 3825.359
to crystallize around my ideas because

3823.2 --> 3827.7
they're true

3825.359 --> 3830.0589999999997
right but that's just the Flat Earth

3827.7 --> 3830.0589999999997
scene

3837.9 --> 3844.2000000000003
I got giant brass balls I what

3842.16 --> 3846.8999999999996
I don't know what that

3844.2 --> 3848.7
I don't understand that saying also if

3846.9 --> 3849.9
you're just saying I got balls I don't

3848.7 --> 3855.319
really know

3849.9 --> 3855.319
what I did specifically to deserve that

3864.72 --> 3870.5389999999998
if you feel that way you are yeah well I

3867.599 --> 3873.299
do feel like Neo in The Matrix

3870.539 --> 3876.2400000000002
I literally feel like that I feel like

3873.299 --> 3879.42
yeah I have awakened to a level that's

3876.24 --> 3882.5389999999998
totally surreal

3879.42 --> 3884.76
and I feel that whenever I put down a

3882.539 --> 3888.0
statement

3884.76 --> 3890.94
it literally Echoes on to The Souls of

3888.0 --> 3892.74
people out there I feel it I feel it

3890.94 --> 3894.66
it's crazy

3892.74 --> 3896.5789999999997
perhaps

3894.66 --> 3900.18
or perhaps I'm just starting to

3896.579 --> 3902.76
understand how this mechanism

3900.18 --> 3907.0789999999997
this interface with physical reality

3902.76 --> 3909.78
really works like the Matrix I see the

3907.079 --> 3913.319
code already I can do stuff

3909.78 --> 3914.3390000000004
well depending on how many people even

3913.319 --> 3916.5589999999997
know

3914.339 --> 3919.2599999999998
that it's real for me and that I'm not

3916.559 --> 3923.099
just oh look I'm special boy I'm like

3919.26 --> 3924.6600000000003
that I and draw in the tropes to try to

3923.099 --> 3927.3590000000004
convince people like I'm that like that

3924.66 --> 3931.46
no I prove it I prove it I prove it by

3927.359 --> 3931.46
being five years too soon

3933.599 --> 3939.44
right or when Benjamin does this in his

3936.24 --> 3939.4399999999996
own right as well by the way

3940.02 --> 3947.94
but yeah he has a massive audience

3944.099 --> 3951.7400000000002
an international attention I do not I'm

3947.94 --> 3951.7400000000002
just this weirdo Dutch guy

3957.059 --> 3962.2200000000003
right

3958.319 --> 3965.359
and you either see it you see what I can

3962.22 --> 3965.359
do or you don't

3965.52 --> 3970.38
and that for me is also important

3967.74 --> 3972.859
because I don't want to be

3970.38 --> 3972.859
like

3973.2 --> 3976.819
I just want to be understood

3982.38 --> 3988.339
that's really it

3985.2 --> 3988.339
there is no spoon

4004.099 --> 4010.28
nobody is crazy like BJ

4007.28 --> 4013.52
well piche look the thing is with piche

4010.28 --> 4016.8190000000004
is really tragic it's mostly tragedy

4013.52 --> 4017.839
because piche is not as crazy as you

4016.819 --> 4020.66
think

4017.839 --> 4023.7799999999997
but he is stuck

4020.66 --> 4026.24
very very stuck

4023.78 --> 4029.599
can't progresses ideas

4026.24 --> 4030.74
that's the real crazy part not the

4029.599 --> 4032.48
content

4030.74 --> 4035.9599999999996
of well

4032.48 --> 4039.7
of the very basic idea by now that's

4035.96 --> 4039.7
it's not very well developed

4042.079 --> 4047.5
it's the same [ __ ] it was like six years

4045.2 --> 4047.5
ago

4048.5 --> 4051.28
get out

4057.26 --> 4060.46
I think clutch

4079.88 --> 4086.6800000000003
all right so I am basically resting in a

4083.18 --> 4089.5
very odd I guess quantum-like position

4086.68 --> 4092.72
where I feel I'm completely

4089.5 --> 4094.46
insignificant like

4092.72 --> 4096.98
but

4094.46 --> 4099.62
am I really

4096.98 --> 4102.199
or is actually

4099.62 --> 4103.759
my retraction

4102.199 --> 4106.58
from

4103.759 --> 4109.46
seeming significance

4106.58 --> 4112.759
has it actually contributed to me being

4109.46 --> 4114.02
able to actually be significant on

4112.759 --> 4117.98
another level

4114.02 --> 4119.540000000001
that is not so visible

4117.98 --> 4122.659
like

4119.54 --> 4125.98
do I have power in the Dark World

4122.659 --> 4125.98
I like to think so

4126.62 --> 4132.199
I feel like I do

4128.839 --> 4135.08
I feel I have a lot more power than I

4132.199 --> 4136.879999999999
am ready to recognize just yet and at

4135.08 --> 4138.38
that yeah

4136.88 --> 4141.319
guess what

4138.38 --> 4144.14
I was originally and very young very

4141.319 --> 4147.080000000001
young age very inspired by Dune and by

4144.14 --> 4147.92
the character Poe I tradies my name is

4147.08 --> 4151.58
Paul

4147.92 --> 4153.259
I was actually named after him by my

4151.58 --> 4155.96
mother saying

4153.259 --> 4157.04
it's for good reason

4155.96 --> 4160.52
because

4157.04 --> 4164.179
yeah I I sympathize

4160.52 --> 4165.580000000001
a lot empathize a lot with that

4164.179 --> 4168.14
character

4165.58 --> 4172.359
Awakening it's all about wait that's

4168.14 --> 4175.04
that's my life Awakening is my power

4172.359 --> 4178.96
everything I do

4175.04 --> 4178.96
always leads to that

4180.44 --> 4185.839
the sleeper has awakened

4182.96 --> 4189.58
I've gone through my gum jabars oh my

4185.839 --> 4189.58
God have I gone through that [ __ ]

4198.02 --> 4202.9400000000005
right so instead of imagine that instead

4200.659 --> 4207.379999999999
of your hand in the Box your entire body

4202.94 --> 4209.96
goes in the Box okay now yeah

4207.38 --> 4213.6990000000005
and it lasts 80 years

4209.96 --> 4217.34
and instead of physical torment you get

4213.699 --> 4219.799999999999
mental emotional spiritual torment and

4217.34 --> 4222.400000000001
like total demoralization about

4219.8 --> 4222.400000000001
everything

4222.62 --> 4226.239
yeah that's my gum Jabar

4239.179 --> 4244.719
if you could give advice to your younger

4241.64 --> 4244.719
self what would it be

4246.56 --> 4248.7390000000005
foreign

4249.08 --> 4254.12
I've already done that

4251.78 --> 4256.58
ever tell anybody

4254.12 --> 4259.5199999999995
yeah I met my future self in the dark

4256.58 --> 4262.78
world like when I was 12.

4259.52 --> 4262.780000000001
and it was horrified

4263.179 --> 4270.8
because yeah blatantly obvious I wasn't

4266.54 --> 4273.62
ready to handle any of that

4270.8 --> 4275.6
it was appealing to me that like oh wow

4273.62 --> 4278.36
am I gonna be a wizard

4275.6 --> 4280.88
why does it hurt so much

4278.36 --> 4283.5199999999995
to suddenly realize that

4280.88 --> 4287.38
why did it hurt so much when I first

4283.52 --> 4287.38
bumped into My Future Self

4287.96 --> 4290.679
why

4293.12 --> 4297.94
I bet you didn't expect to hear that

4295.219 --> 4297.94
answer did you

4306.14 --> 4311.780000000001
right but if

4309.14 --> 4315.320000000001
the problem was

4311.78 --> 4317.719
as I was young I kind of learned very

4315.32 --> 4320.9
early on what was important but I

4317.719 --> 4323.36
couldn't handle it I literally could not

4320.9 --> 4325.28
handle the foresight I could not handle

4323.36 --> 4327.38
the knowledge and it's also important

4325.28 --> 4328.5199999999995
lesson that I got out of that and that

4327.38 --> 4332.42
is

4328.52 --> 4334.76
you got to go through the mistakes you

4332.42 --> 4337.58
got to build up from scratch through

4334.76 --> 4340.64
your own physical mistakes

4337.58 --> 4343.4
because if you just get to learn it

4340.64 --> 4344.780000000001
without physically engaging and figuring

4343.4 --> 4348.44
it out

4344.78 --> 4350.42
doesn't work like it doesn't work it

4348.44 --> 4353.919999999999
actually starts torturing you on the

4350.42 --> 4353.92
inside that's what happened to me

4354.199 --> 4357.919999999999
I got to see things when I just couldn't

4356.3 --> 4360.4400000000005
handle them and they got to learn like

4357.92 --> 4362.9
this is like to learn at a very young

4360.44 --> 4365.12
age when you're so eager to learn and

4362.9 --> 4369.0199999999995
when you then figure out through your

4365.12 --> 4372.199
own dreams like yeah 99 of everything

4369.02 --> 4373.76
you lie everything you ever see listen

4372.199 --> 4375.08
here

4373.76 --> 4380.54
watch

4375.08 --> 4385.04
is a lie it's all a giant lie Crystal

4380.54 --> 4387.92
and it's all like evil

4385.04 --> 4390.08
in complex ways and that it's all about

4387.92 --> 4392.3
the challenge of how do you balance out

4390.08 --> 4394.64
just trying to get up along

4392.3 --> 4398.179
how much do you allow the light to go

4394.64 --> 4401.12
through you and how much do you actually

4398.179 --> 4402.92
effectively resist it and then what can

4401.12 --> 4406.159
you still do

4402.92 --> 4407.719
right one thing I was confronted with as

4406.159 --> 4409.699
a young kid

4407.719 --> 4411.679
is yeah

4409.699 --> 4413.9
you go to get a wife you got to get kids

4411.679 --> 4416.679
you got to get a farm well guess what I

4413.9 --> 4419.179
didn't want any of that I really didn't

4416.679 --> 4422.84
especially the farming part I like

4419.179 --> 4425.54
working in a garden but not like farming

4422.84 --> 4427.82
no and especially not if it's gonna mean

4425.54 --> 4429.44
that I was gonna have to like kill

4427.82 --> 4432.5199999999995
animals or something

4429.44 --> 4437.0599999999995
it's like I was horrified

4432.52 --> 4440.6
horrified by it and now

4437.06 --> 4443.659000000001
like 30 years later I'm horrified that I

4440.6 --> 4446.6
was horrified about it okay

4443.659 --> 4448.759999999999
I was horrified about how I actually

4446.6 --> 4452.02
responded to that and what has happened

4448.76 --> 4452.02
because of all that

4454.34 --> 4459.5
right you know what they told me in the

4456.98 --> 4462.5599999999995
Dark World back then when I basically

4459.5 --> 4466.719
figured out I was horrified about that

4462.56 --> 4466.719
oh that means you're gay

4473.0 --> 4476.32
it's insane

4482.42 --> 4488.659
right

4484.04 --> 4492.86
but I am different now

4488.659 --> 4492.86
not a hundred percent opposite

4492.98 --> 4499.159
but I have gone yeah now through my own

4496.28 --> 4502.34
stupidity mistakes through actually like

4499.159 --> 4505.639999999999
forcing myself to just make stupid life

4502.34 --> 4508.400000000001
mistakes not too bad

4505.64 --> 4510.5
not things that I couldn't work with in

4508.4 --> 4512.96
the rest of my life but it's only

4510.5 --> 4516.94
through the mistakes that I finally have

4512.96 --> 4516.94
figured out some acceptance

4518.179 --> 4526.28
the worst mistake I ever made

4521.84 --> 4530.7390000000005
was to try and bypass mistakes that's

4526.28 --> 4530.739
the worst mistake I've ever made

4534.44 --> 4538.5199999999995
because I didn't understand the value of

4536.84 --> 4542.179
mistakes

4538.52 --> 4545.42
I just wanted the learning part I just I

4542.179 --> 4548.0
didn't I wanted to not make the mistake

4545.42 --> 4550.9
not have like a sense of humiliation or

4548.0 --> 4554.44
weakness I just wanted the learning part

4550.9 --> 4556.58
and that was one of the worst

4554.44 --> 4559.159
intellectual at a very young age

4556.58 --> 4561.46
mistakes that I've ever made it's

4559.159 --> 4561.46
probably

4563.179 --> 4567.46
damaged me the most of everything

4567.679 --> 4576.92
if I'd only just let it go

4572.14 --> 4579.08
and just go do [ __ ] just go do [ __ ] just

4576.92 --> 4583.64
be humiliated by The Mistakes by the

4579.08 --> 4588.44
weaknesses that is part of me just make

4583.64 --> 4590.96
the mistakes just do it and yeah

4588.44 --> 4593.719
I would have probably become a lot

4590.96 --> 4596.06
stronger in many ways I would probably

4593.719 --> 4599.9800000000005
now have a better Constitution I would

4596.06 --> 4602.780000000001
probably not be haunted

4599.98 --> 4605.78
periodically by

4602.78 --> 4605.78
self-loathing

4618.98 --> 4625.099999999999
right because what was that mistake

4621.739 --> 4628.5199999999995
trying to bypass mistakes just wanting

4625.1 --> 4632.38
the learning part yeah

4628.52 --> 4635.06
that's effectively saying I know better

4632.38 --> 4638.84
than the design

4635.06 --> 4642.1990000000005
I'm going to overcome physical reality

4638.84 --> 4644.2390000000005
with my smartness the worst

4642.199 --> 4646.639999999999
word like

4644.239 --> 4649.959999999999
and that happened at a really young age

4646.64 --> 4649.96
I'm talking pre-teens

4674.239 --> 4678.32
making mistakes is how you learn

4675.98 --> 4681.94
unfortunately it's not unfortunate

4678.32 --> 4681.94
that's the whole problem

4688.1 --> 4694.46
I think that the mistakes I sh what I

4691.88 --> 4696.86
should have done back then is realize

4694.46 --> 4703.04
that making the mistakes

4696.86 --> 4705.5199999999995
is the reward and the reward is the

4703.04 --> 4705.5199999999995
punishment

4705.92 --> 4713.5
making the mistakes is the reward

4709.64 --> 4713.5
that's actually the reward

4713.659 --> 4719.299999999999
it's when you fulfill everything and

4716.719 --> 4722.84
then you get all the glory and all the

4719.3 --> 4725.900000000001
riches that's the punishment if I'd only

4722.84 --> 4727.6990000000005
had learned that freaking lesson to the

4725.9 --> 4729.92
Core

4727.699 --> 4733.759999999999
when I was a little kid

4729.92 --> 4736.0
then I wouldn't have had so many issues

4733.76 --> 4736.0
now

4737.78 --> 4740.679
foreign

4749.0 --> 4753.92
yeah it is deep and it's also freaking

4751.82 --> 4757.659
true

4753.92 --> 4760.34
it's insane because it's like directly

4757.659 --> 4763.28
counter-intuitive like your ego is

4760.34 --> 4766.360000000001
counter opposite to that everyone's ego

4763.28 --> 4770.42
is counter opposite to that yet it is

4766.36 --> 4775.159
perfectly true perfectly true

4770.42 --> 4780.1
their mistakes are the reward

4775.159 --> 4780.099999999999
the reward is the punishment

4782.36 --> 4787.4
I'm gonna call this hangout that because

4784.699 --> 4790.419999999999
it should have done that

4787.4 --> 4790.42
a while ago

4791.1 --> 4795.64
[Music]

4792.46 --> 4795.64
[Applause]

4797.0 --> 4804.02
yeah copyright Arwin yeah nobody in this

4801.26 --> 4807.4400000000005
[ __ ] world before me has ever said it

4804.02 --> 4809.659000000001
yeah or maybe some freaking Buddhist or

4807.44 --> 4811.5199999999995
whatever in 2000 years ago

4809.659 --> 4814.46
I'm pretty sure I'm not getting this

4811.52 --> 4817.400000000001
from anyone I this comes out of me I

4814.46 --> 4819.08
have no other relay from which this

4817.4 --> 4823.42
information spring so this comes

4819.08 --> 4823.42
directly from God through me

4827.2 --> 4830.398999999999
[Applause]

4837.92 --> 4842.42
I claim

4839.9 --> 4846.259999999999
hey I might be wrong

4842.42 --> 4851.8
well then point it out to me Source it

4846.26 --> 4851.8
Source who's said this exactly like this

4857.179 --> 4861.1
right be right back two minutes

4955.88 --> 4959.08
[ __ ] pretty

4973.46 --> 4976.46
foreign

4984.92 --> 4990.86
am I calling myself a prophet

4988.1 --> 4991.9400000000005
what am I prophesizing something Nathan

4990.86 --> 4996.28
Yamaha

4991.94 --> 4996.28
or did I just Define something

4996.38 --> 5001.78
is that a prophecy

4998.659 --> 5005.739
what did I prophesize what year what's

5001.78 --> 5009.94
the natural cycle that I laid out

5005.739 --> 5014.218999999999
with saying what I did Nathan Yamaha

5009.94 --> 5014.219
fireling look at look who's talking

5021.34 --> 5028.42
no no CPS not punishment a reward the

5025.78 --> 5031.0599999999995
reward is the punishment you you

5028.42 --> 5034.08
literally can't hear it can you it's the

5031.06 --> 5036.820000000001
ego getting in the way I'm seeing

5034.08 --> 5040.36
well maybe I'm a micro profit then

5036.82 --> 5042.78
because right now what is happening well

5040.36 --> 5046.96
exactly what I said would happen right

5042.78 --> 5050.5
it's directly in opposition to what the

5046.96 --> 5053.139
ego thinks and feels how it likes to see

5050.5 --> 5055.32
things it's in direct opposition so

5053.139 --> 5057.639
you're literally misunderstanding

5055.32 --> 5059.44
misinterpreting what I am saying on

5057.639 --> 5060.52
purpose because that's what your ego

5059.44 --> 5064.0199999999995
wants

5060.52 --> 5064.02
isn't that just interesting

5069.639 --> 5074.679
the phrase comes from no all information

5071.92 --> 5079.12
comes from God Nathan

5074.679 --> 5080.62
I'm not claiming exclusive

5079.12 --> 5083.139
God

5080.62 --> 5086.08
communication yeah it's not exclusive

5083.139 --> 5089.26
I'm not saying oh I am the special boy

5086.08 --> 5090.76
no I'm just saying I just recognized it

5089.26 --> 5093.639
for what it is

5090.76 --> 5095.92
all the information comes from God

5093.639 --> 5099.46
you just got to be ready to take it

5095.92 --> 5104.04
right most people just shove it away

5099.46 --> 5104.04
they want their own little story

5133.96 --> 5140.46
if I make a mistake in my car and kill

5136.6 --> 5140.46
motorcycle then what is the reward

5141.699 --> 5148.5
the reward is is

5144.04 --> 5148.5
you're gonna [ __ ] pay attention now

5148.719 --> 5153.4
and you're going to be haunted in your

5150.58 --> 5155.8
dreams and you're gonna perish under

5153.4 --> 5159.099999999999
that haunting or

5155.8 --> 5161.02
you're actually gonna grow because of it

5159.1 --> 5162.34
become a better person a more

5161.02 --> 5165.780000000001
responsible

5162.34 --> 5165.78
alert person

5168.1 --> 5175.38
and if you do it right you probably even

5171.28 --> 5175.38
get a lot of respect from everybody

5175.54 --> 5178.08
right

5179.56 --> 5186.820000000001
it's a great opportunity in a crisis

5184.0 --> 5189.0
yeah that counts for an individual as

5186.82 --> 5189.0
well

5206.8 --> 5211.6
now for anybody that doesn't know what

5210.1 --> 5213.34
voice I just did that was Henry

5211.6 --> 5215.679
Kissinger

5213.34 --> 5219.659000000001
during the Bilderberg meeting in 2006

5215.679 --> 5219.659
you can see that on end game

5228.4 --> 5233.159
yo hello backs yeah thanks for popping

5231.04 --> 5233.159
by

5233.199 --> 5236.099999999999
hope to see you again

5259.12 --> 5264.4
Kissinger wasn't healed oh yeah

5261.58 --> 5267.42
of course she is

5264.4 --> 5267.42
one of them

5279.76 --> 5281.9400000000005
foreign

5296.88 --> 5301.56
CPS

5298.78 --> 5305.94
you're engaging yeah but you're also

5301.56 --> 5307.780000000001
provably measurably for everybody to see

5305.94 --> 5310.78
misquoting me

5307.78 --> 5313.0
can you see the title

5310.78 --> 5316.0
does the title say

5313.0 --> 5317.62
the reward being the punishment and the

5316.0 --> 5319.6
punishment being the roar is that what

5317.62 --> 5321.76
the title says

5319.6 --> 5327.04
is that what it says

5321.76 --> 5330.159000000001
or you are just literally lip oh I'm

5327.04 --> 5332.8
white noise I can't see it I can't see

5330.159 --> 5335.879999999999
what it says I'm saying it wrong and I

5332.8 --> 5335.88
think that's what he said

5337.0 --> 5342.54
is that what's going on CPS because I

5340.0 --> 5342.54
think it is

5344.679 --> 5349.54
well why I'm asking so you can

5346.96 --> 5354.699
understand my point well first off

5349.54 --> 5357.42
start by getting it right and not saying

5354.699 --> 5357.419999999999
something different

5364.96 --> 5368.699
but you don't know the difference

5370.54 --> 5373.739
are you serious

5374.86 --> 5380.259999999999
so you equate mistake with punishment

5379.06 --> 5382.96
do you

5380.26 --> 5385.0
you really have no idea what I'm talking

5382.96 --> 5389.52
about do you

5385.0 --> 5389.52
like that's not even the same category

5390.28 --> 5396.78
you completely misunderstand

5392.98 --> 5396.78
if you think that's what it says

5400.6 --> 5405.54
Yamaha dude you want to get kicked

5405.94 --> 5410.98
don't [ __ ] tell me to that I'm white

5408.639 --> 5413.04
noise yeah I'm I'm the one doing the

5410.98 --> 5418.379999999999
hangout I'm the one putting it down

5413.04 --> 5418.38
don't [ __ ] straw man me all right

5421.6 --> 5424.8
I don't like your tone

5447.4 --> 5454.36
right yeah and the question had nothing

5450.639 --> 5457.06
to do with what I said it's like oh but

5454.36 --> 5458.799999999999
what do you think about this thing that

5457.06 --> 5460.4800000000005
you didn't say

5458.8 --> 5461.62
it's like yeah it has nothing to do with

5460.48 --> 5463.9
it

5461.62 --> 5466.659
that's not what I said also it's

5463.9 --> 5470.32
incorrect you don't understand esoterics

5466.659 --> 5472.9
at all you completely misunderstood you

5470.32 --> 5474.58
white noise what I said because how I

5472.9 --> 5477.638999999999
wrote it down

5474.58 --> 5479.98
that's exact that's not just oh let's

5477.639 --> 5481.4800000000005
just say it like this you know it

5479.98 --> 5484.178999999999
doesn't really matter yeah it matters

5481.48 --> 5488.04
the details matter if you don't get that

5484.179 --> 5488.04
then you don't get it

5492.52 --> 5495.52
whoa

5496.239 --> 5498.239
what

5504.34 --> 5510.04
was Hitler a reward or a punishment for

5507.76 --> 5511.719
Germany

5510.04 --> 5515.32
This is complicated

5511.719 --> 5519.2390000000005
right at first he was the reward

5515.32 --> 5519.239
and then he became the punishment

5519.46 --> 5524.86
because he came after Germany was

5522.58 --> 5528.04
already really bad

5524.86 --> 5529.179
was it was had gone to [ __ ] and then he

5528.04 --> 5533.0199999999995
came in

5529.179 --> 5537.84
kind of fronted the restoration and some

5533.02 --> 5537.84
dignity and then totally abused it

5539.679 --> 5544.0
he basically used the weakness of the

5542.62 --> 5546.58
situation

5544.0 --> 5549.96
to get a grip over it and then totally

5546.58 --> 5549.96
bend it to its own will

5552.159 --> 5556.78
right and yeah let's put it into context

5554.62 --> 5559.78
the mistake is the reward

5556.78 --> 5562.719
right well Germany

5559.78 --> 5565.659
had gone through that [ __ ]

5562.719 --> 5568.719
and was very punishing to them

5565.659 --> 5573.12
and that was the reward you know why

5568.719 --> 5573.12
because they had weakened

5573.34 --> 5579.159000000001
because of all that

5575.56 --> 5581.620000000001
and then they the newer generation

5579.159 --> 5583.0
crawled out of it to defend itself

5581.62 --> 5586.12
against

5583.0 --> 5590.139
that sort of weakness and now that's in

5586.12 --> 5592.54
the ancestral memory that is the reward

5590.139 --> 5595.139
they have an immunization effect

5592.54 --> 5598.239
spiritually against the what happened

5595.139 --> 5602.4400000000005
because that mistake was made they

5598.239 --> 5602.44
gotten into that position right

5602.98 --> 5611.08
and one it I talk about the reward is

5606.4 --> 5616.0599999999995
the punishment that specifically is

5611.08 --> 5618.82
like the outcome when you do something

5616.06 --> 5621.1
typically you're trying to achieve

5618.82 --> 5622.36
something right you're trying to get an

5621.1 --> 5625.3
angle you're trying to get a little

5622.36 --> 5627.639
power or money that's the reward in that

5625.3 --> 5630.659000000001
context well guess what having that is

5627.639 --> 5630.659000000001
actually the punishment

5632.86 --> 5636.219
when you don't have it you really want

5635.199 --> 5638.259999999999
it

5636.219 --> 5639.94
it pulls you through it pulls you

5638.26 --> 5642.58
through hard times but then when you

5639.94 --> 5645.879999999999
have it it's nothing like how it felt

5642.58 --> 5648.04
when you didn't have it yet

5645.88 --> 5650.26
it doesn't appeal as much when you

5648.04 --> 5652.679
actually have it and then it becomes a

5650.26 --> 5652.679
punishment

5654.88 --> 5660.88
right so these are separate sentences it

5658.9 --> 5663.699
doesn't like just because in both of

5660.88 --> 5665.679
them the the word reward is in them

5663.699 --> 5668.678999999999
doesn't mean that they directly relate

5665.679 --> 5673.08
to each other in in all in all senses

5668.679 --> 5673.08
they're two separate things

5675.88 --> 5681.639
right it's not the mistake is the

5678.219 --> 5685.92
punishment that's not what this says

5681.639 --> 5685.92
this is esoteric this is not literal

5686.139 --> 5692.7390000000005
right the mistake is the reward because

5689.26 --> 5695.7390000000005
the mistakes you make in your life

5692.739 --> 5699.5199999999995
are very rewarding you learn from them

5695.739 --> 5702.218999999999
you shape yourself subtly around them

5699.52 --> 5705.580000000001
and that's the actual reward what you

5702.219 --> 5707.679
get out of that the response

5705.58 --> 5709.84
if you don't make any mistakes you don't

5707.679 --> 5712.3
get any rewards

5709.84 --> 5715.06
you don't develop it

5712.3 --> 5717.88
you just get scared from it

5715.06 --> 5720.6990000000005
right the reward is the punishment is

5717.88 --> 5724.179
another thing

5720.699 --> 5728.919999999999
that's about setting out to do something

5724.179 --> 5732.1
to attain something to to get a reward

5728.92 --> 5734.82
to get an achievement official

5732.1 --> 5734.820000000001
recognition

5735.04 --> 5739.36
skills even right you want to certain

5737.739 --> 5741.4
skill set

5739.36 --> 5743.739
well you're gonna work on it and then

5741.4 --> 5746.08
it's like yeah doing it making the

5743.739 --> 5748.239
mistakes getting the rewards from it and

5746.08 --> 5750.639
then you achieve it you get it well

5748.239 --> 5753.28
guess what once you then have it

5750.639 --> 5756.6
it's changed you

5753.28 --> 5760.179
it takes away a bit of the mystery now

5756.6 --> 5763.06
some parts of you are filled in with

5760.179 --> 5765.76
that skill and that skill makes you look

5763.06 --> 5768.159000000001
at everything in a certain way

5765.76 --> 5771.9400000000005
and in that sense something is actually

5768.159 --> 5774.36
taken from you spiritually and that is a

5771.94 --> 5774.36
punishment

5774.4 --> 5779.619
right and that's that's just with skills

5777.28 --> 5783.9
now when it becomes actual physical

5779.619 --> 5783.9
riches it's even worse

5784.9 --> 5790.739
see see what I'm saying now do you

5788.08 --> 5790.739
finally understand

5802.179 --> 5806.38
you can interchange the two words yeah

5804.219 --> 5809.199
well guess what

5806.38 --> 5812.4400000000005
the title is not

5809.199 --> 5815.32
about English it's not about the English

5812.44 --> 5816.339999999999
language yeah it's not what this is

5815.32 --> 5819.719
about

5816.34 --> 5819.719
this is esoterics

5834.76 --> 5839.26
the rollerblading didn't even happen so

5837.04 --> 5843.06
he did nothing wrong right well he did

5839.26 --> 5843.06
do something wrong classical homeopath

5843.82 --> 5847.92
he basically forced

5847.96 --> 5855.46
an Empire on Germany

5851.92 --> 5858.9
he wanted to conquer the world

5855.46 --> 5858.9
I'd say that's wrong

5862.84 --> 5866.7390000000005
right if you wouldn't have done that

5864.58 --> 5868.719
Germany would have been incredibly

5866.739 --> 5871.178999999999
powerful now

5868.719 --> 5873.4800000000005
if you just hadn't engaged in freaking

5871.179 --> 5873.4800000000005
War

5875.08 --> 5880.719
it would have been like the

5878.5 --> 5883.96
German empires of old

5880.719 --> 5887.699
that's what it would be right now

5883.96 --> 5887.699
if he hadn't done what he did

5887.98 --> 5893.86
right the whole rollerblading incident

5890.8 --> 5898.679
that's just a propaganda side note

5893.86 --> 5898.679
really that's not the mistake

5912.1 --> 5916.780000000001
whilst fan Berlin's that's an illusion

5914.679 --> 5920.56
that doesn't actually exist

5916.78 --> 5923.619
you can't get veed against C

5920.56 --> 5925.84
that literally is impossible it only

5923.619 --> 5927.339999999999
makes things worse and hey if you make

5925.84 --> 5929.4400000000005
that mistake

5927.34 --> 5933.400000000001
well you might get a reward out of it

5929.44 --> 5937.719
but it's gonna cost a lot

5933.4 --> 5939.699
mainly your lifespan a lot of it and

5937.719 --> 5942.82
then yeah you can

5939.699 --> 5946.0599999999995
choose to actually learn from that

5942.82 --> 5948.94
mistake and Ascend through it basically

5946.06 --> 5951.54
take it as a price to pay for your

5948.94 --> 5951.54
Awakening

5952.78 --> 5959.619
but I I wouldn't recommend doing that

5956.619 --> 5962.679
there's less punishing mistakes to make

5959.619 --> 5964.96
right there's less costly mistakes just

5962.679 --> 5966.639
because the mistake is the reward

5964.96 --> 5970.36
doesn't mean that you're gonna just like

5966.639 --> 5972.04
make really senseless mistakes right the

5970.36 --> 5976.599999999999
mistake has to be

5972.04 --> 5979.679
honest natural coming forth from you and

5976.6 --> 5982.54
your misinterpretations

5979.679 --> 5985.9
that's the thing that reveals the reward

5982.54 --> 5988.54
because the reward is your growth that

5985.9 --> 5990.58
comes from it if you just knowingly like

5988.54 --> 5994.3
I'm gonna do an overdose it's a mistake

5990.58 --> 5997.8
yeah duh that's ridiculous that's not a

5994.3 --> 5997.8
mistake that's just insane

5997.9 --> 6003.299999999999
that's not an honest mistake that's

6000.0 --> 6006.3
Insanity that's ludicrous

6003.3 --> 6010.9800000000005
self-destructiveness

6006.3 --> 6012.4800000000005
that's not a mistake that's just idiotic

6010.98 --> 6014.339999999999
that's not a mistake that's going to

6012.48 --> 6016.739
yield a reward you could still call it a

6014.34 --> 6018.54
mistake but it's not a type of mistake

6016.739 --> 6021.32
that's actually natural and it's going

6018.54 --> 6021.32
to yield a reward

6029.46 --> 6035.46
right yeah clutch

6031.619 --> 6037.199
you get it hardship and error

6035.46 --> 6039.4800000000005
that well that's exactly what I'm

6037.199 --> 6043.28
talking about that's what the first half

6039.48 --> 6043.28
of the title implies

6059.639 --> 6066.0
wow look at the votes somebody really

6063.06 --> 6068.54
doesn't like what I'm doing here

6066.0 --> 6071.82
it's incredible

6068.54 --> 6074.5199999999995
and completely wasted time because I

6071.82 --> 6076.86
don't give a [ __ ] dude you could put a

6074.52 --> 6079.7390000000005
thousand downfalls in there a million

6076.86 --> 6081.839999999999
you could literally Break YouTube itself

6079.739 --> 6085.0199999999995
for all I care

6081.84 --> 6088.619000000001
I'm just gonna keep doing what I do

6085.02 --> 6091.1990000000005
because seven up votes is just fine

6088.619 --> 6094.799999999999
that means that seven people actually

6091.199 --> 6097.44
hung in there and appreciate what I do

6094.8 --> 6098.820000000001
is good enough for me because through

6097.44 --> 6101.58
them

6098.82 --> 6104.099999999999
I could Echo

6101.58 --> 6106.34
I just need a couple just a couple of

6104.1 --> 6106.34
people

6107.52 --> 6114.719
and it'll have a Cascade effect

6111.36 --> 6117.659
because it does it now right now already

6114.719 --> 6119.28
does as I've explained earlier in the

6117.659 --> 6121.5
hangout remember

6119.28 --> 6124.44
I get the feeling like dude what I'm

6121.5 --> 6126.96
doing has like serious influence

6124.44 --> 6128.58
it's just surreal because the numbers

6126.96 --> 6132.84
don't show it

6128.58 --> 6135.719
right and the direct personal connection

6132.84 --> 6138.42
seems to be even completely missing most

6135.719 --> 6140.88
of the time but yet whenever I do

6138.42 --> 6143.28
something it seems to like very

6140.88 --> 6146.159000000001
seriously synchronize

6143.28 --> 6149.82
with the world like very serious

6146.159 --> 6152.46
synchronization like almost like magical

6149.82 --> 6154.94
control levels of synchronization is

6152.46 --> 6154.94
freaky

6159.06 --> 6166.5
right so I don't need a million official

6163.08 --> 6169.26
followers I just need a couple a couple

6166.5 --> 6173.219
that actually are there that are really

6169.26 --> 6175.56
listening really listening

6173.219 --> 6177.78
that are trying to understand the

6175.56 --> 6179.88
esoterics that are trying to see the

6177.78 --> 6181.86
patterns that I see

6179.88 --> 6184.38
vividly

6181.86 --> 6187.44
and others too people like Owen Benjamin

6184.38 --> 6189.42
he sees it he sees it oh yes he has the

6187.44 --> 6192.239
sight

6189.42 --> 6196.4400000000005
the virtual side in the mind the the

6192.239 --> 6199.94
pattern the fractal pattern he sees it

6196.44 --> 6199.94
great at dealing with it

6204.78 --> 6210.739
the downvotes is the reward yeah yeah

6207.659 --> 6210.739
well it could be

6218.4 --> 6223.44
you're going to email me proof that

6221.4 --> 6225.839999999999
you're there in listening thank you ilsp

6223.44 --> 6228.839999999999
I know you're real you sent me songs

6225.84 --> 6230.58
dude that you made pretty awesome I

6228.84 --> 6232.56
problem was I wasn't really in the mood

6230.58 --> 6236.239
back then

6232.56 --> 6236.2390000000005
but yeah I know you're real

6236.58 --> 6240.92
and I appreciate your presence in my

6238.739 --> 6240.919999999999
chat

6244.86 --> 6249.739
you're not putting me I know you're not

6247.26 --> 6253.7390000000005
clutch I know no dude you're actually

6249.739 --> 6256.08
very close you're very close to

6253.739 --> 6257.879999999999
or maybe even straight on target of what

6256.08 --> 6261.8
I'm trying to communicate esoterically

6257.88 --> 6261.8
so yeah no dude you're you're great

6270.239 --> 6272.419999999999
foreign

6276.32 --> 6283.699
so All That Remains now is complaining

6279.54 --> 6283.699
about how poor you are

6285.3 --> 6288.7390000000005
clutch is talking to you

6290.46 --> 6295.5
oh right right

6293.219 --> 6298.56
fine

6295.5 --> 6301.46
talk to me damn it it's my show

6298.56 --> 6301.46
whatever

6301.5 --> 6307.1
um

6303.119 --> 6307.099999999999
right okay see you later CBS

6339.3 --> 6343.5
right anyway I think I'm gonna round out

6341.219 --> 6345.84
to show

6343.5 --> 6348.02
it's been a great show very happy with

6345.84 --> 6348.02
it

6357.119 --> 6363.659
right

6359.76 --> 6366.119000000001
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6363.659 --> 6367.86
like this show I certainly did if you

6366.119 --> 6369.119
did then please don't forget to rogans

6367.86 --> 6371.82
it up

6369.119 --> 6373.86
or if Rogan's it down now dude I really

6371.82 --> 6376.94
don't care

6373.86 --> 6376.94
it's all good

6377.34 --> 6381.54
right

6378.78 --> 6386.0599999999995
it doesn't matter that you do that it's

6381.54 --> 6386.06
not gonna matter because anybody

6386.159 --> 6393.78
that cares about anything that matters

6390.719 --> 6395.54
doesn't care about it do you see that

6393.78 --> 6398.759999999999
so it's only

6395.54 --> 6401.159
superficial stupid losers

6398.76 --> 6403.92
that are not gonna understand the

6401.159 --> 6406.98
esoterics of what I say anyway

6403.92 --> 6409.92
