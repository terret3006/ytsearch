[Music]

108.32 --> 113.52
feeling a bit overwhelmed by the heat

111.6 --> 115.03999999999999
so i kind of took a shasta because i

113.52 --> 116.719
just felt sick

115.04 --> 118.71900000000001
it was

116.719 --> 120.399
right yeah right now the shadow is

118.719 --> 122.79899999999999
already

120.399 --> 124.64
like away from the wall

122.799 --> 127.60000000000001
so it's getting more tolerable here but

124.64 --> 129.75900000000001
but it was so hot

127.6 --> 131.35999999999999
it's just not funny

129.759 --> 134.07999999999998
so i had to like

131.36 --> 136.959
lay down stairs on the couch

134.08 --> 136.959
where it's cooler

137.84 --> 141.84
and just like

139.599 --> 144.72
take it 20 minutes sleep did me some

141.84 --> 146.31900000000002
real good though

144.72 --> 148.56
right so

146.319 --> 150.95899999999997
still doing the show

148.56 --> 150.959
later

153.92 --> 156.92
right

157.28 --> 161.36
it is saturday the 16th of

160.4 --> 164.36
june

161.36 --> 164.36
2022

165.92 --> 168.16
uh

168.48 --> 173.84
let's see

171.26 --> 177.84
[Music]

173.84 --> 180.48
yeah it's 28 degrees celsius but also

177.84 --> 183.44
it's like 51 humidity yesterday there

180.48 --> 185.44
was not that much but that really does

183.44 --> 189.319
make a difference between

185.44 --> 189.319
tolerable and intolerable

200.4 --> 202.8
right

203.28 --> 207.519
anyway

205.68 --> 209.28
yesterday

207.519 --> 210.72
i thought yesterday's show was great i

209.28 --> 213.92
didn't watch it back yet though but it

210.72 --> 215.92
did give it a title at least

213.92 --> 218.23899999999998
letters debates would also grate very

215.92 --> 218.23899999999998
long

218.64 --> 222.07999999999998
it's not a four hour show but pretty

220.56 --> 224.319
long

222.08 --> 227.31900000000002
uh

224.319 --> 227.319
see

228.879 --> 233.84
yeah made by jim bob was live that was

230.959 --> 233.84
very interesting

234.159 --> 237.599
a lot of

235.519 --> 240.959
christian talk

237.599 --> 243.28
so i was basically ramming out my

240.959 --> 244.959
christian perception

243.28 --> 247.28
into the chat

244.959 --> 247.28
there

249.519 --> 254.56
hello gadget inspector first in chat

252.0 --> 258.88
47

254.56 --> 258.88
southwest france holy sheesh

262.0 --> 266.84
i had to close the schools

264.8 --> 269.04
what do you

266.84 --> 272.0
mean i mean

269.04 --> 274.40000000000003
france like closed its schools because

272.0 --> 277.199
of the heat wave

274.4 --> 277.19899999999996
very sensible

277.28 --> 283.55999999999995
especially if they don't all have like

280.32 --> 283.56
air conditioning

286.32 --> 290.96
yeah the 47 is freaking nuts

289.52 --> 293.19899999999996
that's like

290.96 --> 297.75899999999996
lead to some kind of very deep

293.199 --> 297.759
underground basement kind of eats

299.04 --> 301.28000000000003
god

302.96 --> 306.71999999999997
it's like flee through the caves

308.639 --> 313.759
because if you're like if it's that hot

311.6 --> 315.28000000000003
if you're in the ocean you're still

313.759 --> 318.639
gonna like

315.28 --> 318.63899999999995
get a heat stroke and [ __ ]

319.039 --> 326.0
you really have to like get deep shade

323.039 --> 326.0
with that type of heat

329.6 --> 335.91900000000004
anyhow welcome to the show

332.24 --> 337.84000000000003
hope others will drop in as well

335.919 --> 339.75899999999996
but i guess that everybody's like

337.84 --> 341.52
affected by the heat so i'm not gonna be

339.759 --> 344.88
too uh

341.52 --> 344.88
distracting everybody

347.039 --> 351.96
i'm gonna try to be cool

348.96 --> 351.96
today

354.08 --> 359.84
it's down the garden 3am yeah yeah oh

356.8 --> 359.84000000000003
you have a pool nice

361.199 --> 366.16
yeah yeah with this weather like in the

364.08 --> 368.8
evening when it really cools down it

366.16 --> 370.08000000000004
cools down a bit and in the night it's

368.8 --> 373.199
yeah

370.08 --> 375.44
i was up relatively late as well

373.199 --> 379.16
till

375.44 --> 379.16
half past two

384.16 --> 390.16
but maybe it's just kind of now

386.56 --> 392.88
shester weather i'm used to that i know

390.16 --> 395.28000000000003
about it like through my vacations to

392.88 --> 398.15999999999997
spain and all that

395.28 --> 400.0
is like yeah you go to bed

398.16 --> 403.12
not very early

400.0 --> 405.36
necessarily but not too late

403.12 --> 407.759
then you sleep till the early morning

405.36 --> 410.88
then you basically do some stuff

407.759 --> 410.88
whatever you were gonna do

411.199 --> 416.16
and then like in the full afternoon you

413.759 --> 418.0
just go and find a shady place somewhere

416.16 --> 420.08000000000004
or

418.0 --> 423.28
under a parasol in the beach

420.08 --> 426.31899999999996
at the beach and just like sleep

423.28 --> 427.67999999999995
chester so that's what i just did for 20

426.319 --> 429.44
minutes

427.68 --> 432.40000000000003
and if this kind of heat is gonna keep

429.44 --> 434.96
it up i'm gonna probably keep doing that

432.4 --> 437.19899999999996
if it gets worse i'm just gonna kind of

434.96 --> 439.52
temporarily discontinue the early bird

437.199 --> 442.72
show and maybe do night owl shows

439.52 --> 445.84
instead because it's really too hot like

442.72 --> 447.52000000000004
at one o'clock it's just too hot it's

445.84 --> 449.84
really not funny it's

447.52 --> 451.75899999999996
it's very unpleasant sitting here when

449.84 --> 453.599
it's that hot like when the sun is still

451.759 --> 454.96000000000004
hitting the wall it's extremely

453.599 --> 456.639
unpleasant

454.96 --> 459.28
so

456.639 --> 459.28000000000003
be warned

460.4 --> 465.71999999999997
uh hey psych bear

462.319 --> 465.72
let's see you

466.24 --> 470.84000000000003
all right anyway i got a

468.4 --> 473.52
nice bottle of

470.84 --> 477.15999999999997
refrigerator cooled water so that was a

473.52 --> 477.15999999999997
great idea of mine

479.199 --> 481.44
ah

483.039 --> 488.71999999999997
you really have to be careful with this

485.44 --> 490.71999999999997
like oh yeah and i got my fan

488.72 --> 492.72
back

490.72 --> 494.40000000000003
for emergencies

492.72 --> 496.96000000000004
but it's really tricky because this

494.4 --> 501.28
thing can really like cool you off

496.96 --> 501.28
and then you kind of like dehydrate

501.44 --> 504.08
it's weird

505.36 --> 510.16
like just a fan to cool you off is not

507.919 --> 513.28
enough you you then gotta like drink a

510.16 --> 513.28
lot of water on top of

518.839 --> 523.7600000000001
that yeah i got you this factor sure it

521.68 --> 523.76
is

524.8 --> 530.56
it's just lensing or something or just

528.16 --> 532.64
whatever

530.56 --> 535.8389999999999
yeah the heliocentric model makes very

532.64 --> 535.8389999999999
little sense

574.959 --> 578.4799999999999
right anyway

578.88 --> 583.4399999999999
i'm up for talking about whatever you

580.8 --> 583.4399999999999
guys want

584.0 --> 589.519
it's funny i had a call with my dad

587.2 --> 592.08
this morning as well

589.519 --> 592.08
and he's like

592.16 --> 598.0
interest he's digging very far into this

596.24 --> 600.24
especially like the whole ukraine

598.0 --> 602.8
situation there's so much going on with

600.24 --> 604.48
that it's

602.8 --> 606.88
it's a lot of work

604.48 --> 609.44
he seems to be right on top of it so i

606.88 --> 611.519
have my assertions i cross-referenced it

609.44 --> 614.6400000000001
with him

611.519 --> 616.839
and he corrected me on some details was

614.64 --> 618.959
like oh

616.839 --> 620.48
wow okay

618.959 --> 622.56
didn't know it was

620.48 --> 623.94
specifically like that

622.56 --> 625.68
it was interesting

623.94 --> 628.6800000000001
[Music]

625.68 --> 628.68
uh

632.16 --> 636.16
so has anybody caught up on the uh

637.44 --> 642.8000000000001
sleeping warriors jam panda stream

640.72 --> 645.03
for over two hours anybody actually

642.8 --> 648.809
watch that

645.03 --> 648.809
[Music]

648.959 --> 654.7199999999999
i don't recommend you watch it in like

652.16 --> 656.48
in the middle of a heat wave though

654.72 --> 658.839
this is

656.48 --> 661.04
you'll probably get a pretty bad

658.839 --> 664.0790000000001
headache you might have to wait until

661.04 --> 664.079
things cool down a bit

669.76 --> 676.3199999999999
a pga cnet flip flip flat and seeking

673.12 --> 676.32
star wars good to see you

684.73 --> 691.12
[Music]

687.36 --> 691.12
can't watch that gem crash

692.0 --> 697.6
i don't blame you seeking star wars very

694.48 --> 697.6
few people that can

700.72 --> 704.9590000000001
like did you hear neil neil constantino

703.12 --> 708.0
from fed

704.959 --> 708.0
you hear him about it

708.399 --> 712.16
i told him

709.92 --> 713.92
i think it wasn't on the after show as a

712.16 --> 716.959
joke

713.92 --> 719.68
like hey neil i'm gonna i'm gonna like

716.959 --> 722.0
lock you up in a chair like

719.68 --> 722.0
uh

722.88 --> 726.88
like clockwork orange and just make you

725.44 --> 729.44
watch

726.88 --> 731.92
the jam panda interview on sleeping

729.44 --> 733.839
words without being able to close your

731.92 --> 736.0
eyes or fall asleep

733.839 --> 739.36
and he was like now

736.0 --> 740.8
this is like a general shriek of terror

739.36 --> 742.48
this is

740.8 --> 745.4799999999999
hilarious

742.48 --> 745.48
uh

746.639 --> 753.839
gone cool here 30 years 14

749.839 --> 755.519
that's cool that's a lot of cooling off

753.839 --> 760.1600000000001
that's very quickly

755.519 --> 760.16
are you feeling it like in your bones

762.0 --> 767.04
usually when it's like really rapidly

764.16 --> 769.1999999999999
cooling off like very rapidly

767.04 --> 773.519
very short time then ice

769.2 --> 776.24
usually gets like it's like like the

773.519 --> 779.519
like the tissue that directly covers

776.24 --> 779.519
bones what's it called again

779.6 --> 782.9590000000001
let me

780.56 --> 785.4499999999999
google translate it because i do know it

782.959 --> 788.579
in dutch

785.45 --> 788.5790000000001
[Music]

801.2 --> 803.519
what

803.92 --> 808.88
periosteum

805.76 --> 808.88
wow okay that's

809.6 --> 816.0
okay well medical people yeah the

812.72 --> 817.839
the stuff the stuff that's like directly

816.0 --> 820.16
on top of your bones

817.839 --> 822.1600000000001
that's what i feel when it really

820.16 --> 823.68
rapidly cools down

822.16 --> 827.3199999999999
in the weather

823.68 --> 827.3199999999999
are you feeling that

843.44 --> 847.6
right

845.519 --> 851.279
yeah well i to be fair i wouldn't mind

847.6 --> 851.279
if it cool off a bit here

851.44 --> 856.8800000000001
right i mean i like that it's like a

854.399 --> 861.959
nice warm summer and all but

856.88 --> 861.959
like but massive heat and all

870.0 --> 874.48
i like it best when it's like

872.24 --> 877.04
when it just kind of peak heats and then

874.48 --> 878.48
goes down a bit and then goes back and

877.04 --> 880.7199999999999
it just goes

878.48 --> 882.24
or like a

880.72 --> 885.36
three days

882.24 --> 886.5600000000001
sunny and one day's kind of rainstorm or

885.36 --> 888.48
something

886.56 --> 890.399
like that's the best

888.48 --> 892.16
those that's the best order that's like

890.399 --> 896.079
the best for the plants everything gets

892.16 --> 896.079
water and it gets maximum sun

896.32 --> 900.399
nothing dries out

898.94 --> 902.8000000000001
[Music]

900.399 --> 904.8
so i am kind of hoping that

902.8 --> 906.959
it's weird it's weird when i think about

904.8 --> 908.16
it it's almost like yeah i really hope

906.959 --> 911.5999999999999
the

908.16 --> 914.079
the geo engineer guys have like

911.6 --> 916.48
the best interest at heart for the

914.079 --> 918.3199999999999
netherlands at least that they might

916.48 --> 920.8000000000001
implement like

918.32 --> 924.279
a geoengineering program that will have

920.8 --> 924.279
that as a result

926.079 --> 933.279
like one rainstorm every

929.6 --> 933.279
every four or five days

938.72 --> 942.32
what's a fledgling bird

942.56 --> 948.079
right by the way i'm seeing some dead

945.04 --> 948.079
birds here too

949.04 --> 951.92
i think even like it

953.279 --> 958.399
the dead swan baby that was like really

956.24 --> 961.44
heartbreaking to see

958.399 --> 961.44
i think that yeah

962.24 --> 964.88
what's going on

965.6 --> 969.839
baby birds right yeah i've been seeing

967.36 --> 969.839
it too

972.16 --> 976.639
there was one that was just really weird

974.56 --> 979.68
and delirious it was like wandering

976.639 --> 983.839
around in the field completely alone

979.68 --> 983.8389999999999
no idea what what happened

984.56 --> 988.4399999999999
like where is the parent

1000.48 --> 1002.72
yeah

1003.199 --> 1008.88
yeah it's yeah it way in spain the heat

1006.16 --> 1011.12
waves could get really terrible

1008.88 --> 1013.199
they should have like a

1011.12 --> 1014.9590000000001
they should work on having a really good

1013.199 --> 1017.04
system to

1014.959 --> 1019.3599999999999
to take care of that like they should

1017.04 --> 1019.36
have

1019.519 --> 1025.72
like

1020.32 --> 1025.72
really good water storage systems

1025.76 --> 1028.64
where they basically use the entire

1027.6 --> 1031.12
winter

1028.64 --> 1034.0
to store up massive amounts of good

1031.12 --> 1036.319
quality water

1034.0 --> 1038.24
that they can then use when the summer

1036.319 --> 1040.959
hits

1038.24 --> 1044.24
right not just like bottled water in

1040.959 --> 1044.24
stores but just

1052.4 --> 1057.2
i mean i take care of the birds

1055.28 --> 1059.2
here

1057.2 --> 1061.679
by putting out that bowl of water and

1059.2 --> 1064.559
when it's this hot i do that like three

1061.679 --> 1067.039
or four times in a day

1064.559 --> 1068.48
normally it's like once a day

1067.039 --> 1070.08
throughout the rest of the year but this

1068.48 --> 1072.16
time it's like four times a day because

1070.08 --> 1073.9189999999999
they they're just constantly desperate

1072.16 --> 1076.16
for it and i'm really noticing that

1073.919 --> 1079.039
they're like

1076.16 --> 1082.3200000000002
extremely happy about it like they are

1079.039 --> 1085.44
exhilarated they feel like very lucky

1082.32 --> 1088.0
so i'm happy to do that i wish more

1085.44 --> 1090.96
people did that like they don't need

1088.0 --> 1092.48
like oh bread cheap ass bread everywhere

1090.96 --> 1093.6000000000001
but just

1092.48 --> 1096.32
water

1093.6 --> 1099.36
water when it's hot

1096.32 --> 1102.799
even gave like the the cat some water

1099.36 --> 1105.9189999999999
yesterday and it needed it

1102.799 --> 1108.4
so yeah where's the heat wave

1105.919 --> 1110.7990000000002
also think of the animals

1108.4 --> 1113.2800000000002
make sure that they get enough water

1110.799 --> 1115.36
maybe leave out a big bowl of water for

1113.28 --> 1116.559
the birds outside i mean they're they're

1115.36 --> 1119.9599999999998
gonna be

1116.559 --> 1119.96
needing it

1131.2 --> 1133.919
rain tomorrow france

1133.12 --> 1136.08
oh

1133.919 --> 1137.8400000000001
okay

1136.08 --> 1138.72
well it makes sense gadget inspector i

1137.84 --> 1139.84
mean

1138.72 --> 1143.1200000000001
it is

1139.84 --> 1145.039
like around the the pyrenees

1143.12 --> 1147.28
the mountain range between france and

1145.039 --> 1148.96
spain and there's usually like in the

1147.28 --> 1151.9189999999999
summer

1148.96 --> 1154.16
that's why i referenced that right

1151.919 --> 1156.88
like there's like super heat and then

1154.16 --> 1160.0
suddenly like a big storm

1156.88 --> 1162.72
comes from there and then just like

1160.0 --> 1164.88
could get to like hillstones even

1162.72 --> 1167.6000000000001
it's a pretty dramatic weather change

1164.88 --> 1167.6000000000001
when that happens

1168.72 --> 1173.6000000000001
but it's really helpful though

1171.919 --> 1178.6000000000001
because it does kind of stock up the

1173.6 --> 1178.6
region on water a bit when it happens

1187.12 --> 1192.559
oh yeah i know pjc net

1190.32 --> 1194.32
screw those freaking climate change

1192.559 --> 1196.6399999999999
wankers

1194.32 --> 1199.6
screw that don't listen to it don't

1196.64 --> 1200.4
listen to any of it ever

1199.6 --> 1204.1589999999999
just

1200.4 --> 1206.64
prepare if you know this place gets hot

1204.159 --> 1209.6000000000001
get water storage that's what the

1206.64 --> 1211.919
ancient did too right they did that too

1209.6 --> 1215.28
they like the freaking romans build

1211.919 --> 1216.96
aqueducts why do you think they did that

1215.28 --> 1218.799
yeah

1216.96 --> 1221.8400000000001
because you need water especially when

1218.799 --> 1221.84
it's hot

1222.24 --> 1227.1200000000001
and yeah remember like

1224.64 --> 1230.4
those weird

1227.12 --> 1233.28
inverted pyramid water

1230.4 --> 1235.6000000000001
storage places that apparently aren't

1233.28 --> 1237.84
being used anymore why aren't people

1235.6 --> 1239.4399999999998
using that again

1237.84 --> 1242.6399999999999
use those things

1239.44 --> 1245.3600000000001
get it you can like store water in there

1242.64 --> 1247.919
and it will not evaporate apparently for

1245.36 --> 1249.76
some reason it's the way to the ancient

1247.919 --> 1251.44
stored water

1249.76 --> 1253.36
do that

1251.44 --> 1255.919
do that

1253.36 --> 1260.36
in the hot regions do it build those

1255.919 --> 1260.3600000000001
things do it get water storage

1262.0 --> 1267.44
right just like in the really really

1264.88 --> 1269.8400000000001
typically rainy countries where floods

1267.44 --> 1269.8400000000001
happen

1269.919 --> 1274.4
that's where you want to have good

1272.159 --> 1277.3600000000001
pumping system

1274.4 --> 1278.3200000000002
for the time when it gets really rainy

1277.36 --> 1281.12
again

1278.32 --> 1283.6789999999999
and the normal rivers can't handle it

1281.12 --> 1286.0
etc etc like

1283.679 --> 1289.2
it's just called preparation nature's

1286.0 --> 1290.799
always been like this you just need

1289.2 --> 1293.1200000000001
to

1290.799 --> 1296.6399999999999
account for it because it is a

1293.12 --> 1296.6399999999999
reoccurring situation

1297.44 --> 1302.0
every region has its natural hazards

1300.08 --> 1302.84
just prepare for it

1302.0 --> 1306.799
have

1302.84 --> 1306.799
systems for it

1307.039 --> 1310.76
and you'll be all right

1318.48 --> 1324.08
breaking all-time records

1321.12 --> 1326.2399999999998
really all-time records

1324.08 --> 1330.4399999999998
i mean there's been some really heavy

1326.24 --> 1330.44
heating waves in spain man

1352.24 --> 1357.36
right filler barrel rain

1354.88 --> 1359.2800000000002
yeah right or one of those upside down

1357.36 --> 1361.6
pyramid water vaults

1359.28 --> 1363.28
right just haven't ready then the storm

1361.6 --> 1367.1999999999998
comes

1363.28 --> 1367.2
and there you got it you got water again

1368.08 --> 1372.32
we never saw this heating yeah it is a

1370.08 --> 1374.8799999999999
bit early you're right gadget inspector

1372.32 --> 1377.36
usually it happens like halfway july

1374.88 --> 1381.7600000000002
right that's when the real heat comes

1377.36 --> 1381.76
halfway july to halfway august

1382.559 --> 1386.36
so it is a bit early

1390.08 --> 1395.0
cisterns what the no system

1409.28 --> 1411.6
what

1415.52 --> 1419.36
oh you're talking about flip flat

1421.12 --> 1426.7199999999998
metal complex what the with who else

1429.76 --> 1433.039
why would we do that

1436.4 --> 1442.26
it sounds like a numpty

1439.6 --> 1445.4399999999998
it's africa

1442.26 --> 1447.2
[Music]

1445.44 --> 1451.0800000000002
i don't think africa

1447.2 --> 1451.0800000000002
could really help it

1464.0 --> 1467.6
difficult to know

1465.44 --> 1469.8400000000001
yep just seen that no i'm not listening

1467.6 --> 1472.1589999999999
to any of it all time record this

1469.84 --> 1473.9189999999999
ultimate really cool put it in the

1472.159 --> 1476.0
register

1473.919 --> 1478.159
and try to do something about it if

1476.0 --> 1482.24
you're gonna [ __ ] whine about climate

1478.159 --> 1483.2
change then shut your pie hole

1482.24 --> 1487.559
yeah

1483.2 --> 1491.6000000000001
climate changes we have to deal with it

1487.559 --> 1494.96
co2 policy and

1491.6 --> 1497.52
like all that garbage does not help

1494.96 --> 1500.24
trying to take away

1497.52 --> 1503.12
like products or our

1500.24 --> 1507.279
waste product side product from industry

1503.12 --> 1509.76
is not going to change it

1507.279 --> 1512.88
you [ __ ] numpties

1509.76 --> 1512.8799999999999
it doesn't help

1512.96 --> 1520.64
like ruining industry is not gonna

1516.72 --> 1520.64
change the climate

1521.76 --> 1526.08
it's only gonna make everything harder

1523.44 --> 1529.76
for the humans to cope with the climate

1526.08 --> 1532.799
change that just happens naturally

1529.76 --> 1532.799
that's all it does

1534.24 --> 1542.0
climate change is a eugenics mind

1537.279 --> 1545.039
control program to exterminate mankind

1542.0 --> 1547.12
it does not help nature it does not help

1545.039 --> 1549.679
anything

1547.12 --> 1552.799
the only thing it helps is the

1549.679 --> 1555.279
money banker scammers

1552.799 --> 1557.679
that play into it that's the only thing

1555.279 --> 1559.919
it helps helps their

1557.679 --> 1562.48
the number on their bank account that's

1559.919 --> 1565.44
the only thing it helps nothing else is

1562.48 --> 1567.84
helped by climate change policies

1565.44 --> 1571.8400000000001
and systems and scams

1567.84 --> 1571.84
nothing else ever

1578.24 --> 1582.799
right you want to do something about

1580.159 --> 1585.2
climate change deal with it deal with

1582.799 --> 1586.6399999999999
the climate figure it out figure out

1585.2 --> 1588.559
what do we need

1586.64 --> 1591.279
what do we need here oh there's a lot of

1588.559 --> 1594.0
heat heat it usually becomes a problem

1591.279 --> 1595.039
oh it could get worse yeah well deal

1594.0 --> 1597.039
with it

1595.039 --> 1598.559
yeah

1597.039 --> 1600.559
it's what my

1598.559 --> 1602.799
ancestors sort of

1600.559 --> 1605.6789999999999
did as well here it's like oh we we got

1602.799 --> 1607.84
flooding problems right we have fro wow

1605.679 --> 1610.3200000000002
yeah we're the end of a river sometimes

1607.84 --> 1613.4399999999998
it flooded right it's a bit like the

1610.32 --> 1617.279
bangladesh situation except the dutch

1613.44 --> 1619.3600000000001
actually did something about it

1617.279 --> 1622.0
in bangladesh

1619.36 --> 1625.1999999999998
barely and that's why being half the

1622.0 --> 1627.12
country just gets destroyed periodically

1625.2 --> 1628.4
because they don't know what to do about

1627.12 --> 1629.52
the floods

1628.4 --> 1632.96
we

1629.52 --> 1634.799
build entire infrastructure systems

1632.96 --> 1638.159
based around it

1634.799 --> 1642.559
we call dikes and polders and all that

1638.159 --> 1645.5200000000002
and we learn to deal with the climate

1642.559 --> 1646.48
through engineering

1645.52 --> 1649.44
now

1646.48 --> 1651.84
we don't get floods ever

1649.44 --> 1654.0800000000002
nothing much else has changed we still

1651.84 --> 1655.84
get a lot of rain every now and then and

1654.08 --> 1658.8799999999999
still sometimes there's a little bit of

1655.84 --> 1663.12
a rain flood guess what netherlands is

1658.88 --> 1666.159
full of bumps because we dealt with the

1663.12 --> 1670.1999999999998
climate we know what happens here we've

1666.159 --> 1673.44
accounted for it we got our

1670.2 --> 1676.159
environmental business in order

1673.44 --> 1677.52
that's actual dealing with climate

1676.159 --> 1678.48
change

1677.52 --> 1682.72
yeah

1678.48 --> 1685.52
not investing in money scams based on

1682.72 --> 1685.52
co2

1688.96 --> 1694.91
right

1691.74 --> 1694.91
[Music]

1699.12 --> 1703.9499999999998
ah

1700.81 --> 1703.95
[Music]

1706.64 --> 1710.5590000000002
black people can think they actually

1708.32 --> 1713.039
destroy god's great yes yes it is

1710.559 --> 1715.6
pompous incredibly pompous but it's

1713.039 --> 1717.279
mostly the denial of the cohesion of the

1715.6 --> 1720.48
designer god

1717.279 --> 1723.2
it is all like oh it's so stupid oh it's

1720.48 --> 1725.679
gonna go wrong oh nothing

1723.2 --> 1727.039
like we have to catch up with our

1725.679 --> 1730.0800000000002
intelligence

1727.039 --> 1732.399
our existence will falter and be

1730.08 --> 1734.96
destroyed if it wasn't for the smash the

1732.399 --> 1736.8799999999999
smart special boys

1734.96 --> 1739.2
nothing would have ever survived we

1736.88 --> 1742.0
we've already been destroyed yeah that's

1739.2 --> 1744.0800000000002
what they do isn't it it's the atheist

1742.0 --> 1746.32
arrogance

1744.08 --> 1749.9189999999999
thinking that nothing is functional

1746.32 --> 1752.0
actually it's only the smart people

1749.919 --> 1754.24
that prevent everything from being

1752.0 --> 1757.039
destroyed it's it's a special boy

1754.24 --> 1758.799
complex it's a godless special boy

1757.039 --> 1759.76
complex

1758.799 --> 1762.48
and

1759.76 --> 1764.24
to be fair i kind of used to do that

1762.48 --> 1767.039
myself a bit

1764.24 --> 1769.84
it's very embarrassing

1767.039 --> 1772.96
i don't do that anymore at all it's

1769.84 --> 1772.9599999999998
quite the opposite now

1773.12 --> 1778.559
flip flat enough already about the guy

1775.919 --> 1780.48
you want people to send comments who's

1778.559 --> 1782.559
obviously a nobody

1780.48 --> 1784.08
some numpty on the internet dude what

1782.559 --> 1787.84
you're doing is like equivalent to

1784.08 --> 1790.72
telling us dude go to sean hawkins

1787.84 --> 1794.6789999999999
and send him a comment like why

1790.72 --> 1794.679
why would we do that

1797.679 --> 1803.64
dude i don't care about your trolling

1800.0 --> 1803.64
obsessions okay

1811.279 --> 1816.32
less destruction of the natural co2

1813.84 --> 1817.4399999999998
filtration so the tropical reinforcement

1816.32 --> 1818.96
help

1817.44 --> 1822.3200000000002
yeah or

1818.96 --> 1824.24
we start producing more co2 which is

1822.32 --> 1826.96
good for nature

1824.24 --> 1830.0
as i said the entire thing

1826.96 --> 1832.32
is as much of a scam as the heliocentric

1830.0 --> 1835.039
model everything they say

1832.32 --> 1839.36
how it works is all wrong it's exactly

1835.039 --> 1843.12
the opposite co2 is essential for growth

1839.36 --> 1845.76
in nature releasing co2 is literally

1843.12 --> 1847.12
considered within emulators on the

1845.76 --> 1847.96
computer

1847.12 --> 1850.8799999999999
a

1847.96 --> 1855.6000000000001
terraforming substance

1850.88 --> 1859.679
it literally terraforms it creates plant

1855.6 --> 1861.9189999999999
life like you you throw out co2 and the

1859.679 --> 1864.0800000000002
plants will go

1861.919 --> 1865.679
they will literally ram out of the

1864.08 --> 1867.84
ground okay

1865.679 --> 1871.1200000000001
there's deserts

1867.84 --> 1873.84
and literally became grass fields

1871.12 --> 1877.4399999999998
just starting to form nature why because

1873.84 --> 1881.279
of co2 from industry in the environment

1877.44 --> 1883.519
in the direct vicinity co2 is super

1881.279 --> 1886.32
essential for plant growth

1883.519 --> 1889.279
i think that co2 is actually like a

1886.32 --> 1891.2
valuable resource

1889.279 --> 1893.44
that should be taken more serious

1891.2 --> 1897.2
especially in agriculture

1893.44 --> 1898.64
you should like having co2 containers

1897.2 --> 1901.3600000000001
that you basically

1898.64 --> 1903.039
in a controlled way unleash within your

1901.36 --> 1907.799
greenhouses

1903.039 --> 1907.799
is actually a very good idea

1909.36 --> 1913.84
so

1910.32 --> 1915.36
climate change policy is satanic

1913.84 --> 1917.039
and needs to be

1915.36 --> 1920.1589999999999
killed off

1917.039 --> 1923.36
just like corona policy

1920.159 --> 1927.44
just like the freaking global homo

1923.36 --> 1929.84
agenda it all leads only to destruction

1927.44 --> 1935.0
it all needs to be completely erased and

1929.84 --> 1935.0
the organizers all need to burn on pires

1942.88 --> 1947.679
and when i say that i mean that they

1945.2 --> 1950.039
need to burn as witches

1947.679 --> 1954.0
they are satanic

1950.039 --> 1956.24
witchcraft wielding scumbags

1954.0 --> 1958.159
they are not human anymore

1956.24 --> 1960.72
everything they've created and that they

1958.159 --> 1964.48
use for power is pure evil and

1960.72 --> 1967.1200000000001
destruction they need to die

1964.48 --> 1967.1200000000001
for that

1967.42 --> 1973.259
[Music]

1975.039 --> 1978.8799999999999
it needs to discontinue

1978.0 --> 1981.44
the

1978.88 --> 1985.0390000000002
systematic destruction based on

1981.44 --> 1986.64
ignorance and weakness of humanity

1985.039 --> 1989.64
needs to

1986.64 --> 1989.64
end

2002.08 --> 2005.12
ah well there you go seeking star wars

2003.84 --> 2008.8799999999999
yeah i know

2005.12 --> 2011.5189999999998
it is epic co2 is great it's a valuable

2008.88 --> 2011.519
resource

2014.32 --> 2019.9189999999999
and the funny thing is

2016.64 --> 2022.64
you can use humans for it

2019.919 --> 2024.159
because humans breathe out they exhale

2022.64 --> 2024.88
co2

2024.159 --> 2026.96
so

2024.88 --> 2029.1200000000001
you could literally just have a bunch of

2026.96 --> 2033.279
people

2029.12 --> 2036.2399999999998
just stand around breathing

2033.279 --> 2036.24
in a greenhouse

2036.72 --> 2040.88
i mean it's very much quicker to just

2038.799 --> 2041.9189999999999
have a co2 tank but

2040.88 --> 2044.72
yeah

2041.919 --> 2048.56
that's also why you don't want to

2044.72 --> 2051.52
replace workers on a farm with freaking

2048.56 --> 2053.919
robots because guess what robots don't

2051.52 --> 2055.599
exhale co2

2053.919 --> 2058.3199999999997
they don't have that personal energy

2055.599 --> 2060.8
they don't give the social interaction

2058.32 --> 2062.48
with the plants that they need for

2060.8 --> 2064.8
encouragement

2062.48 --> 2064.8
yeah

2065.839 --> 2069.599
they usually only create problems

2071.919 --> 2078.2799999999997
yes

2074.879 --> 2078.2799999999997
ah package

2113.359 --> 2121.68
i love it when that happens

2116.64 --> 2121.68
when packages arrive early unexpectedly

2126.4 --> 2131.6800000000003
yeah

2128.079 --> 2133.599
i actually did an order on infowars

2131.68 --> 2136.7999999999997
because there's a certain substance that

2133.599 --> 2136.8
i really needed

2139.76 --> 2144.88
so i just ordered it and i yeah

2142.8 --> 2146.6400000000003
i did that when i had a lot more money

2144.88 --> 2148.7200000000003
so

2146.64 --> 2149.95
it's like all together it's not even 100

2148.72 --> 2151.52
euros

2149.95 --> 2152.56
[Music]

2151.52 --> 2155.56
but uh

2152.56 --> 2155.56
yeah

2168.079 --> 2171.7200000000003
not male vitality

2176.8 --> 2179.6800000000003
mostly this

2182.32 --> 2188.6400000000003
so happy to have this again

2186.56 --> 2194.119
shield x2

2188.64 --> 2194.1189999999997
best source of iodine in this world

2201.119 --> 2204.96
and my original bottle have completely

2203.359 --> 2207.44
run out so

2204.96 --> 2207.44
also

2207.76 --> 2210.88
i got some of these

2212.839 --> 2218.0
right ultimate krill oil

2215.839 --> 2221.04
for special occasions it's like it's

2218.0 --> 2223.359
basically like the best fish oil ever

2221.04 --> 2225.839
so i'm not gonna like chug that

2223.359 --> 2227.52
it's really good to have

2225.839 --> 2230.16
like all of this what's in maximum

2227.52 --> 2233.04
discount right so i got it all

2230.16 --> 2233.04
relatively cheap

2233.68 --> 2237.2
and then of course a bonus

2238.16 --> 2244.3999999999996
ultimate bone broth

2240.32 --> 2246.4
which is like the best milkshake ever

2244.4 --> 2249.6800000000003
it is

2246.4 --> 2253.92
i mix this in with like uh rice

2249.68 --> 2253.9199999999996
coconut milk oh so

2254.839 --> 2260.4
good right but yeah these are not like

2258.0 --> 2263.52
normal consumption products these are

2260.4 --> 2266.0
like special products that i'm gonna

2263.52 --> 2268.56
take a very long time

2266.0 --> 2268.56
to use

2269.599 --> 2272.96
and packaging stream

2271.52 --> 2275.28
right

2272.96 --> 2276.8
but i mostly did it for the iodine in

2275.28 --> 2278.48
retrospect it might have even been

2276.8 --> 2280.96
smarter to just get three of those

2278.48 --> 2280.96
bottles

2283.28 --> 2288.5600000000004
i could beat the new alex jones

2286.32 --> 2288.56
well

2288.88 --> 2292.56
how about i can be the old alex jones

2291.52 --> 2295.599
let

2292.56 --> 2297.44
alex jones just be that new alex jones i

2295.599 --> 2301.28
don't want to be like the new alex jones

2297.44 --> 2301.28
i want to be like the old alex jones

2302.96 --> 2307.68
because investments thank you i

2304.88 --> 2307.6800000000003
appreciate that

2309.599 --> 2316.0
again i i did it mostly for the iodine

2312.4 --> 2316.0
because my bottle had run up

2316.48 --> 2320.4
i barely

2318.0 --> 2323.599
like i usually like

2320.4 --> 2326.0
this little ball i've taken like

2323.599 --> 2327.839
over two years with this there were

2326.0 --> 2329.04
three even

2327.839 --> 2331.359
right

2329.04 --> 2333.599
and then there was a time when there was

2331.359 --> 2335.839
just a lot of issues with ordering like

2333.599 --> 2338.839
the order system didn't work payments it

2335.839 --> 2340.48
was all just getting all

2338.839 --> 2342.72
broken

2340.48 --> 2344.8
so i tried it out again

2342.72 --> 2346.56
and this time it worked really smoothly

2344.8 --> 2350.32
so

2346.56 --> 2350.32
yeah but the iodine

2350.64 --> 2355.359
like this stuff is miracle stuff for me

2353.599 --> 2360.7200000000003
it is literally

2355.359 --> 2363.2
like measurable iq enhancers for me

2360.72 --> 2365.52
it really is so

2363.2 --> 2365.52
um

2366.079 --> 2369.079
oh

2369.68 --> 2373.7599999999998
when you taste that the first time it's

2371.839 --> 2378.68
so gross

2373.76 --> 2378.6800000000003
when you get over that it's so good

2382.32 --> 2386.48
because it just the taste kind of

2383.92 --> 2390.32
reminded me first of like

2386.48 --> 2390.32
the stuff you put on band-aids

2392.56 --> 2397.44
which is not meant for consumption of

2394.48 --> 2400.8
course like that

2397.44 --> 2402.96
but it is so much better

2400.8 --> 2404.48
indeed iodine

2402.96 --> 2408.2
it's great

2404.48 --> 2408.2
it is great

2419.76 --> 2423.88
this is catching the spring

2426.0 --> 2430.24
right so that was that sorry it was very

2427.92 --> 2430.2400000000002
short

2432.96 --> 2437.92
i wish i would have ordered more but for

2435.599 --> 2441.04
that i'll need more paypal donations

2437.92 --> 2441.04
because i can't afford it

2441.76 --> 2446.4
it's an antiseptic to eat that's right

2444.0 --> 2449.28
it's it's everything like you can put

2446.4 --> 2451.2000000000003
that stuff on a band-aid

2449.28 --> 2453.92
you can

2451.2 --> 2456.24
like especially like put a droplet of

2453.92 --> 2458.7200000000003
colloidal silver along with some iodine

2456.24 --> 2460.319
on the band-aid your wound will heal in

2458.72 --> 2462.64
record time

2460.319 --> 2466.599
or your scratch i mean if it's a serious

2462.64 --> 2466.5989999999997
wounded something else but

2470.079 --> 2474.0
but yeah i have put it on the cut works

2472.24 --> 2478.4399999999996
great

2474.0 --> 2478.44
but i prefer just eating it

2480.64 --> 2482.96
oh

2486.24 --> 2490.0789999999997
dude

2487.2 --> 2492.72
like yeah

2490.079 --> 2494.7200000000003
i can't feel it

2492.72 --> 2497.2799999999997
i haven't had that in a while

2494.72 --> 2499.7599999999998
i kind of saved that drop for uh

2497.28 --> 2502.079
for like the last time

2499.76 --> 2503.8390000000004
and i really needed it

2502.079 --> 2507.7200000000003
but now i got the new bottle it's like

2503.839 --> 2507.72
okay let's take that

2514.16 --> 2519.1189999999997
the most magnificent about it is that it

2516.16 --> 2522.5989999999997
just helped my concentration so much it

2519.119 --> 2522.599
really does

2523.52 --> 2529.68
like that stuff can potentially actually

2526.0 --> 2529.68
make me read an entire book

2530.88 --> 2534.8
because normally i just get a headache

2533.04 --> 2537.839
get impatient

2534.8 --> 2539.92
get distracted

2537.839 --> 2542.0
but with that i'm pretty sure they can

2539.92 --> 2543.359
actually completely read it whatever

2542.0 --> 2546.359
it's going to be as long as it's

2543.359 --> 2546.359
interesting

2551.28 --> 2555.76
yes i then used

2553.359 --> 2558.0
to be used for a lot of different things

2555.76 --> 2560.2400000000002
in like the

2558.0 --> 2560.24
uh

2561.079 --> 2568.6400000000003
pre-medical system era

2563.839 --> 2571.839
iodine was just like a staple stuff

2568.64 --> 2571.839
that pharmacists had

2572.16 --> 2575.68
like herbalists no yeah they had iodine

2574.72 --> 2578.72
because

2575.68 --> 2581.2
that was kind of widely known i mean it

2578.72 --> 2582.3999999999996
wasn't like oh everybody loves iodine

2581.2 --> 2584.64
it's just

2582.4 --> 2587.119
everybody thinks it's kind of gross

2584.64 --> 2589.44
but it just really works

2587.119 --> 2591.44
so if you know that as an herbalist or

2589.44 --> 2594.079
whatever you can just say like you have

2591.44 --> 2596.16
to take this

2594.079 --> 2598.079
and then somebody probably would if they

2596.16 --> 2599.92
trusted them

2598.079 --> 2602.079
if they wouldn't be like oh man give me

2599.92 --> 2604.319
the latest iodine because especially in

2602.079 --> 2607.119
the past it wasn't all like

2604.319 --> 2610.319
laboratory refined and all that i think

2607.119 --> 2612.1600000000003
some of it would have even been like

2610.319 --> 2613.92
like fermented

2612.16 --> 2616.56
stuff

2613.92 --> 2620.119
seaweed or something right it probably

2616.56 --> 2620.119
was pretty gross

2620.319 --> 2624.48
this isn't gross this is pretty good

2632.16 --> 2635.359
wow you could can't read books anymore

2634.16 --> 2637.7599999999998
okay

2635.359 --> 2637.7599999999998
at all

2640.48 --> 2643.76
i i still could

2644.4 --> 2650.079
if i really needed to

2647.599 --> 2653.76
i mean there are some books that i am

2650.079 --> 2653.76
kind of interested in reading

2654.4 --> 2658.8
the problem usually is now that because

2656.64 --> 2661.52
of the way i do things

2658.8 --> 2664.0
i like figure out the entirety of the

2661.52 --> 2666.8
book before i've even read it all

2664.0 --> 2668.72
like things like that where i just catch

2666.8 --> 2670.48
on too quickly

2668.72 --> 2674.1189999999997
i can start to predict what's gonna

2670.48 --> 2674.119
happen and all that

2676.16 --> 2681.2799999999997
but there's probably still some really

2678.56 --> 2684.56
epic books out there that don't

2681.28 --> 2686.8
that won't have that effect

2684.56 --> 2688.839
i'm kind of interested in like the the

2686.8 --> 2691.44
castanada

2688.839 --> 2694.0
book i've like already heard about that

2691.44 --> 2696.56
even in the past my dad's

2694.0 --> 2698.24
read it i think it was part of a course

2696.56 --> 2700.48
that he did

2698.24 --> 2702.3999999999996
at some point and it was like a really

2700.48 --> 2704.96
magical book and i've heard vox day

2702.4 --> 2708.1600000000003
about it and other

2704.96 --> 2710.2400000000002
like adjacent people and benjamin i kind

2708.16 --> 2712.319
of want to read that book i really do

2710.24 --> 2714.7999999999997
want that book to read

2712.319 --> 2717.2
and then take my time

2714.8 --> 2720.88
because i think that i'm like right

2717.2 --> 2721.7599999999998
enough at this point to actually do that

2720.88 --> 2725.04
like

2721.76 --> 2726.96
10 years ago 15 years ago i was not

2725.04 --> 2729.52
ready for it

2726.96 --> 2732.079
i knew that it was like

2729.52 --> 2734.319
heavy it was it would blow my mind i

2732.079 --> 2736.7200000000003
just would i didn't want it i wasn't

2734.319 --> 2738.319
ready yet now i feel like i really want

2736.72 --> 2740.319
to read this book

2738.319 --> 2742.24
i think i might even get things about it

2740.319 --> 2746.079
that other people haven't seen

2742.24 --> 2748.0789999999997
as i typically do

2746.079 --> 2750.319
but that's not important i just want to

2748.079 --> 2752.88
read it

2750.319 --> 2754.96
oh talking about which yeah carlos

2752.88 --> 2757.2000000000003

2764.4 --> 2767.76
although i do kind of want the paper

2766.079 --> 2769.44
book i think

2767.76 --> 2771.2000000000003
because i don't want to like i don't

2769.44 --> 2773.359
like reading off a screen i don't want

2771.2 --> 2775.68
to like stare at the screen which is

2773.359 --> 2777.7599999999998
literally by the way radiating heat as

2775.68 --> 2780.0789999999997
well

2777.76 --> 2782.3190000000004
i kind of wanted a book for but to have

2780.079 --> 2784.2400000000002
the pdf would also be great so thanks

2782.319 --> 2787.319
for that tip

2784.24 --> 2791.52
here's something else i read my freaking

2787.319 --> 2793.92
symbolics.nl site yesterday

2791.52 --> 2795.84
and i was like

2793.92 --> 2797.359
what the [ __ ]

2795.84 --> 2799.599
[Music]

2797.359 --> 2804.0
holy [ __ ]

2799.599 --> 2806.48
did i like dig deep man

2804.0 --> 2808.96
i like my mind was blown just reading

2806.48 --> 2813.44
that back

2808.96 --> 2815.839
i can't believe i i wrote down that much

2813.44 --> 2819.359
and that it worked it worked it still

2815.839 --> 2823.599
works it's so mechanical

2819.359 --> 2823.5989999999997
it's so mechanical it works

2824.48 --> 2829.839
and the weird thing is like there's no

2826.8 --> 2832.5600000000004
mention of jesus christ anywhere in it i

2829.839 --> 2834.16
had no intention of even grafting that

2832.56 --> 2837.839
in

2834.16 --> 2837.839
but it still does fit

2839.599 --> 2845.599
anybody ever read my symbolics dot nl

2842.8 --> 2848.7200000000003
site i see the theory section it is in

2845.599 --> 2850.78
english i specifically translated it to

2848.72 --> 2853.9199999999996
english at the time myself

2850.78 --> 2856.8390000000004
[Music]

2853.92 --> 2860.559
because there's some

2856.839 --> 2863.2799999999997
serious seriously develop ideas

2860.559 --> 2863.28
like dude

2865.68 --> 2870.16
like the god spirit self-created gods

2868.4 --> 2872.1600000000003
and the summary of principles and

2870.16 --> 2873.52
effects i'm just looking at that and

2872.16 --> 2877.96
like dude

2873.52 --> 2877.96
i wrote that in 2006

2879.119 --> 2881.359
how

2884.559 --> 2888.8390000000004
how did i figure that out

2902.72 --> 2909.04
looked it over but need to read it

2905.359 --> 2909.04
which which one do you mean

2909.44 --> 2915.2400000000002
my symbolic site is not that elaborate

2912.079 --> 2915.2400000000002
at all

2915.599 --> 2920.2400000000002
it's just like

2918.079 --> 2921.599
maximum of 20 pages

2920.24 --> 2924.0789999999997
that's it

2921.599 --> 2925.28
i've never been for an elaborate writer

2924.079 --> 2926.96
right

2925.28 --> 2928.7200000000003
it's like yeah i'll make a book and

2926.96 --> 2930.2400000000002
that's the most important information

2928.72 --> 2932.48
ever ever

2930.24 --> 2935.5989999999997
it'll be like 10 pages

2932.48 --> 2938.48
and that will literally be enough that's

2935.599 --> 2941.119
how i typically do things i do it like a

2938.48 --> 2942.64
machine because i don't care for padding

2941.119 --> 2945.839
i don't care

2942.64 --> 2948.0
for people being able to catch up

2945.839 --> 2950.72
on their own pace i'm like no i'm just

2948.0 --> 2954.559
gonna put the perfect leaf envisioned

2950.72 --> 2957.359
crystal exactly as is don't give a [ __ ]

2954.559 --> 2959.599
if you get it or not

2957.359 --> 2961.119
like if you're ready

2959.599 --> 2965.8
just bang

2961.119 --> 2965.8
raw engram cook

2977.04 --> 2982.079
i don't know if you have chicks just

2979.119 --> 2985.599
check me to the west and are now the new

2982.079 --> 2989.119
super power there don't be

2985.599 --> 2992.079
too hasty about that but yeah they have

2989.119 --> 2993.6800000000003
absolutely crushed the situation

2992.079 --> 2996.1600000000003
russia's crushing it

2993.68 --> 2998.319
and like to say i called it very early

2996.16 --> 3000.319
on maybe even earlier than owen benjamin

2998.319 --> 3002.64
who gets a [ __ ] really

3000.319 --> 3004.48
he can take it you know most people

3002.64 --> 3008.319
probably got it through him

3004.48 --> 3012.8
i was very early like oh i don't want to

3008.319 --> 3016.8
sign with the russians but or i

3012.8 --> 3020.2400000000002
remember all that apologetic crap

3016.8 --> 3022.48
from everybody including um yeah yeah

3020.24 --> 3025.4399999999996
well i didn't say that i say

3022.48 --> 3027.28
[ __ ] that russia is gonna win nothing

3025.44 --> 3029.76
can stop them from winning i don't give

3027.28 --> 3032.48
a [ __ ] if you don't like him your

3029.76 --> 3035.8390000000004
problem you've been indoctrinated by

3032.48 --> 3038.88
slanderous western media that's absolute

3035.839 --> 3043.359
horseshit i've been warning about that

3038.88 --> 3043.359
freaking 15 years ago

3044.48 --> 3050.64
and 10 years ago

3047.52 --> 3054.48
literally literally unapologetic i just

3050.64 --> 3055.44
said no i'm with russia you get it you

3054.48 --> 3058.2400000000002
[ __ ]

3055.44 --> 3061.04
i'm with russia i'm with putin you hear

3058.24 --> 3061.839
me i don't give a [ __ ] you don't like

3061.04 --> 3064.72
him

3061.839 --> 3066.48
i don't give a [ __ ] i'm with him i said

3064.72 --> 3070.319
it at the start

3066.48 --> 3071.359
there you go now i'm a special boy

3070.319 --> 3074.0
sorry

3071.359 --> 3074.0
i had to say

3080.839 --> 3086.96
that right but i call it i call it

3085.04 --> 3089.44
they win

3086.96 --> 3091.76
and if you bet against that then you're

3089.44 --> 3094.76
a dumb [ __ ] and you're probably gonna be

3091.76 --> 3094.76
broke

3110.0 --> 3115.44
right yeah yeah iodine is not for

3112.88 --> 3115.44
chugging

3115.839 --> 3119.52
especially this is concentrated

3118.16 --> 3120.8799999999997
so yeah

3119.52 --> 3122.079
you remember

3120.88 --> 3125.28
tony whitcomb

3122.079 --> 3129.28
i'm i'm very happy about that

3125.28 --> 3129.28
for some reason i have pride in that

3135.359 --> 3140.64
because i i like to be the guy that's

3137.359 --> 3142.4
like oh everybody's going to carefully

3140.64 --> 3146.319
bring it to you

3142.4 --> 3149.04
uh like no [ __ ] you [ __ ] you 99 of the

3146.319 --> 3150.96
people you're all [ __ ]

3149.04 --> 3152.359
you're all 10 years behind because

3150.96 --> 3154.96
you're dumb

3152.359 --> 3158.5589999999997
complacent [ __ ] wits

3154.96 --> 3162.96
i'm just gonna say it exactly as it is

3158.559 --> 3167.28
exactly as raw as you can imagine

3162.96 --> 3168.96
putin is right russia's gonna win

3167.28 --> 3170.8
if you can't deal with that you're

3168.96 --> 3173.76
[ __ ] morons

3170.8 --> 3175.44
i called it it's happening i called it

3173.76 --> 3177.119
done

3175.44 --> 3179.599
yeah no

3177.119 --> 3182.88
i don't like putin

3179.599 --> 3185.2000000000003
bought he her support [ __ ] you

3182.88 --> 3189.6400000000003
i'm with putin

3185.2 --> 3189.64
hear me i am with him

3202.96 --> 3206.559
r1 how about that

3206.88 --> 3211.2400000000002
don't you do it right

3208.88 --> 3217.4390000000003
aries 106.

3211.24 --> 3217.439
[Music]

3222.8 --> 3228.1600000000003
yeah that's my response luke's jones was

3225.68 --> 3231.1189999999997
right well r1

3228.16 --> 3235.64
okay that's my that's my hashtag that's

3231.119 --> 3235.6400000000003
my meme spread it around r1

3247.92 --> 3251.6800000000003
i'm more fed up with the world than you

3250.319 --> 3254.24
flip flap

3251.68 --> 3254.24
probably

3254.319 --> 3257.839
this

3255.839 --> 3261.44
i'm laughing about it but it's kind of a

3257.839 --> 3263.359
nervous laughter but yeah

3261.44 --> 3266.64
i'm really freaking fed up with the

3263.359 --> 3267.92
world when i say burn them

3266.64 --> 3271.44
i'm not

3267.92 --> 3274.48
talking metaphorically

3271.44 --> 3274.48
i kind of mean it

3276.24 --> 3281.2799999999997
i mean you can think of it as

3278.64 --> 3284.5589999999997
metaphorically because that still works

3281.28 --> 3287.2000000000003
yeah fractal thinking convenience but i

3284.559 --> 3290.3590000000004
do also actually mean it

3287.2 --> 3290.359
you see

3295.839 --> 3299.92
he's putting it on the globe earth

3297.599 --> 3302.4
conspiracy what the [ __ ] who gives a

3299.92 --> 3302.4
[ __ ]

3303.599 --> 3309.3590000000004
dude he doesn't care putin doesn't care

3307.359 --> 3311.92
putin doesn't care about your stupid

3309.359 --> 3314.0789999999997
philosophical struggles

3311.92 --> 3315.92
he's a pragmatist

3314.079 --> 3318.799
he's there to win

3315.92 --> 3318.799
and he's doing it

3318.96 --> 3321.52
like

3319.68 --> 3323.68
if you're gonna ask putin about that

3321.52 --> 3328.48
like he's gonna be like dude just go

3323.68 --> 3331.1189999999997
back to your nerd rooms and square

3328.48 --> 3333.359
he doesn't give a [ __ ] i promise you

3331.119 --> 3335.44
putin doesn't give a [ __ ]

3333.359 --> 3337.119
about your globe versus flat earth

3335.44 --> 3339.92
struggles okay

3337.119 --> 3339.92
he doesn't care

3346.0 --> 3350.4
i mean he wants like

3348.48 --> 3352.64
roscomm and all that they want the

3350.4 --> 3354.96
russian space project to continue

3352.64 --> 3357.359
because it's been pretty good

3354.96 --> 3359.92
they've done a lot of

3357.359 --> 3362.64
creative and even some intellectually

3359.92 --> 3364.559
stimulating things with it it's like i

3362.64 --> 3366.8799999999997
think they're doing it better than all

3364.559 --> 3369.119
the other countries especially america

3366.88 --> 3371.6800000000003
russia is doing great with the space

3369.119 --> 3374.079
situation i mean it still has its

3371.68 --> 3375.839
problems i mean it is a lie

3374.079 --> 3376.96
right and that will always bring

3375.839 --> 3380.88
problems

3376.96 --> 3383.2
but i think on average it's like yeah

3380.88 --> 3385.28
that's kind of how i would do it

3383.2 --> 3387.4399999999996
right it is the mo like the russia's

3385.28 --> 3388.8390000000004
policy with space and all that is the

3387.44 --> 3391.839
most dual

3388.839 --> 3396.0
cosmogonical compatible

3391.839 --> 3397.44
like everything about russia is awesome

3396.0 --> 3400.24
in this age

3397.44 --> 3402.839
is everything that is happening there is

3400.24 --> 3407.04
like compatible with what i have

3402.839 --> 3407.04
envisioned for the world

3411.52 --> 3416.64
oh you weren't listening then you numpty

3414.799 --> 3419.119
because i wasn't talking about whether

3416.64 --> 3422.319
it's real or not i'm talking about what

3419.119 --> 3422.319
are they doing with it

3424.16 --> 3429.44
like

3425.52 --> 3431.7599999999998
making people interested in engineering

3429.44 --> 3435.04
building big things

3431.76 --> 3437.3590000000004
designing of complex things right it's

3435.04 --> 3440.4
not just all props

3437.359 --> 3443.2
like the us and nasa does they just do

3440.4 --> 3444.2400000000002
dumb props and see how badly they can

3443.2 --> 3447.04
fool

3444.24 --> 3449.359
people still like how [ __ ] can we

3447.04 --> 3450.16
make this look and they'll still buy it

3449.359 --> 3452.96
right

3450.16 --> 3455.44
they're more in it for the hutzpah

3452.96 --> 3457.44
than to actually stimulate the public

3455.44 --> 3460.2400000000002
creatively

3457.44 --> 3463.359
russia seems to be much more focused on

3460.24 --> 3466.319
stimulating the creativity of the public

3463.359 --> 3468.64
with it than america is

3466.319 --> 3470.799
you know this is true

3468.64 --> 3473.44
you can just see it

3470.799 --> 3476.0
no space engineering is not real it's

3473.44 --> 3478.0
conceptual it's fictional

3476.0 --> 3480.319
people can still build things for

3478.0 --> 3484.44
fictional reasons

3480.319 --> 3484.44
just like on a movie set

3489.52 --> 3494.64
putin steals taxpayer money better for

3492.319 --> 3494.64
sure

3496.48 --> 3501.079
hi good servant what is it

3516.64 --> 3521.7599999999998
my ideas for the world

3519.2 --> 3526.2
yes good servant my ideas for the world

3521.76 --> 3526.2000000000003
hello to you too what

3531.04 --> 3536.5589999999997
yeah that's right rain dancer it's all

3532.88 --> 3536.559
fake russia's fake is better

3537.599 --> 3543.2000000000003
right it's a difference but like getting

3540.24 --> 3544.8799999999997
metaphorical right

3543.2 --> 3548.64
russia is like

3544.88 --> 3551.6800000000003
yes hello my child this is santa claus

3548.64 --> 3555.52
he bring present from the north pole

3551.68 --> 3558.0789999999997
right and you be a good boy now

3555.52 --> 3560.0
right and then there's america like oh

3558.079 --> 3562.1600000000003
you want some candy

3560.0 --> 3563.839
oh yeah oh look at look at what i got in

3562.16 --> 3567.68
my pocket

3563.839 --> 3571.0789999999997
right that's the difference here

3567.68 --> 3571.0789999999997

good servant hello hello

3589.119 --> 3594.359
statement you want to make good servant

3591.359 --> 3594.359

okay good servant i'm glad you know that

3633.599 --> 3636.799

3643.2 --> 3646.319
over at where you're at

3646.4 --> 3653.1600000000003
but it's california right so you're

3648.4 --> 3653.1600000000003
probably very hot right now

3669.76 --> 3672.76
uh

3684.16 --> 3690.799
right yeah the commies did the only

3687.359 --> 3692.799
convincing space walk ever

3690.799 --> 3695.04
all right the only one that have ever

3692.799 --> 3695.839
seen that i'm like yeah that's actually

3695.04 --> 3699.119
a

3695.839 --> 3701.44
real space walk and they did it animated

3699.119 --> 3703.92
it's amazing yeah of course it looks

3701.44 --> 3705.76
fake as [ __ ] but it looks better than

3703.92 --> 3708.2400000000002
the crap that they roll out now like

3705.76 --> 3709.3590000000004
they don't even try this [ __ ] anymore

3708.24 --> 3711.2799999999997
the only thing

3709.359 --> 3714.24
where you can see anything like that is

3711.28 --> 3715.3590000000004
in hollywood movies now

3714.24 --> 3718.16
right

3715.359 --> 3720.5589999999997
like the martian oh look at him always

3718.16 --> 3723.92
floating oh [ __ ] oh

3720.559 --> 3725.76
yeah well the russians the soviets

3723.92 --> 3727.44
actually

3725.76 --> 3730.4
tried that

3727.44 --> 3733.2000000000003
and like as a real claim

3730.4 --> 3737.079
that's freaking impressive man

3733.2 --> 3737.0789999999997
they at least tried

3744.72 --> 3747.359
no

3746.319 --> 3749.44
no

3747.359 --> 3752.0789999999997
no no

3749.44 --> 3755.119
stop advertising for anti-flat earthers

3752.079 --> 3758.96
on my channel i recommend everybody that

3755.119 --> 3761.839
actually follows my channel to never go

3758.96 --> 3762.88
to an anti-flat earther channel for any

3761.839 --> 3764.0
reason

3762.88 --> 3766.1600000000003
ever

3764.0 --> 3767.68
that's my recommendation

3766.16 --> 3769.2799999999997
never go there

3767.68 --> 3771.9199999999996
never comment

3769.28 --> 3774.079
never watch anything it's all a waste of

3771.92 --> 3776.16
your time the only thing they want is

3774.079 --> 3778.079
your attention

3776.16 --> 3780.319
like trolls

3778.079 --> 3782.6400000000003
like they don't care if you troll them

3780.319 --> 3784.72
they just want the clicks they want the

3782.64 --> 3786.8799999999997
attention they don't care they don't

3784.72 --> 3789.68
care if you spank them they don't care

3786.88 --> 3789.6800000000003
if you hate them

3790.16 --> 3795.0389999999998
don't go there ever

3793.28 --> 3797.8390000000004
[ __ ] them

3795.039 --> 3797.8390000000004
let them rot

3798.24 --> 3801.7599999999998
like leave that [ __ ] to fed

3800.45 --> 3805.3999999999996
[Music]

3801.76 --> 3805.4

3818.96 --> 3824.7200000000003
yeah that's right aries 106. i'll take

3821.92 --> 3826.799
russian communists

3824.72 --> 3830.72
over these modern

3826.799 --> 3833.68
baggy piece of [ __ ] demon communists

3830.72 --> 3836.0789999999997
every day of the week

3833.68 --> 3836.0789999999997
yeah

3836.48 --> 3842.88
i'll take russian old-style communists

3839.599 --> 3847.2000000000003
over the new disgusting

3842.88 --> 3850.52
satanic communism every day of the week

3847.2 --> 3850.52
that's right

3852.24 --> 3856.4799999999996
at least they grew out of it

3854.48 --> 3859.119
right they actually learned from that

3856.48 --> 3859.119
experience

3859.92 --> 3864.48
they still have a people

3862.0 --> 3867.92
okay they still have a people can you

3864.48 --> 3869.68
imagine that look at the west right now

3867.92 --> 3873.119
how much do you think is going to be

3869.68 --> 3878.48
left of that after our communist phases

3873.119 --> 3880.4
of how much cohesion will we have left

3878.48 --> 3883.039
before you [ __ ]

3880.4 --> 3884.96
on russian communism okay

3883.039 --> 3886.3190000000004
they at least they still have a people

3884.96 --> 3888.559
now

3886.319 --> 3890.96
how about you in your country

3888.559 --> 3893.039
with your communist new world order

3890.96 --> 3894.88
government how how good do you think

3893.039 --> 3896.6400000000003
you're gonna come out of it

3894.88 --> 3899.6400000000003
yeah as a people

3896.64 --> 3899.64
huh

3917.21 --> 3920.32
[Music]

3922.079 --> 3925.44
yeah there's gonna be

3924.16 --> 3927.359
like

3925.44 --> 3929.839
there's gonna be nothing left of the

3927.359 --> 3933.0389999999998
west you understand it's just going to

3929.839 --> 3933.0389999999998
be chaos

3933.119 --> 3939.28
and probably like if that yeah that sort

3936.4 --> 3940.48
of [ __ ] inevitably leads to like tribal

3939.28 --> 3942.1600000000003
wars

3940.48 --> 3944.88
where everything is destroyed

3942.16 --> 3946.8799999999997
infrastructure everything that is

3944.88 --> 3948.96
supposedly valuable and cultural

3946.88 --> 3950.799
everything is just going to be destroyed

3948.96 --> 3952.0
do you understand

3950.799 --> 3954.079
if like

3952.0 --> 3957.28
massive swarms of foreigners that have

3954.079 --> 3958.88
been weaponized or like rammed into

3957.28 --> 3961.599
countries

3958.88 --> 3963.2000000000003
well everybody is locally is being

3961.599 --> 3965.52
taught to be gay

3963.2 --> 3967.52
and chop their genitals off and all that

3965.52 --> 3969.44
crap yeah what do you think's gonna be

3967.52 --> 3971.359
left of that yeah

3969.44 --> 3973.359
i think that the the russian communists

3971.359 --> 3974.88
did pretty damn well

3973.359 --> 3976.88
considering

3974.88 --> 3981.1600000000003
considering what we're now going through

3976.88 --> 3981.1600000000003
i think they did pretty damn well

3996.16 --> 4000.799
do you think russia's departed new

3998.0 --> 4004.0
orleans yeah yeah it's gonna rule it

4000.799 --> 4007.52
be freaking glad

4004.0 --> 4008.72
be happy that russia is gonna rule over

4007.52 --> 4010.88
you

4008.72 --> 4014.0789999999997
because it's gonna do a lot freaking

4010.88 --> 4016.319
better than what we got now

4014.079 --> 4020.6800000000003
you got it

4016.319 --> 4020.68
you should be happy about that

4024.27 --> 4027.369
[Music]

4032.079 --> 4035.6800000000003
yeah i know i don't associate with

4033.599 --> 4037.92
communism either i'm just saying that

4035.68 --> 4039.68
yeah they went through their soviet

4037.92 --> 4042.48
stuff

4039.68 --> 4044.0789999999997
it almost destroyed them but there they

4042.48 --> 4046.88
got out of it and they're still a

4044.079 --> 4048.4
cohesive people

4046.88 --> 4051.039
right that's

4048.4 --> 4054.4
that's remarkable

4051.039 --> 4057.96
let's see if we fare the same

4054.4 --> 4057.96
i doubt it

4062.559 --> 4066.1600000000003
right so it's not oh they were

4064.319 --> 4068.48
communists oh that makes them good no

4066.16 --> 4070.48
that's just [ __ ] to assert that i

4068.48 --> 4072.48
don't think communism is good at all i

4070.48 --> 4074.48
think it's a giant test

4072.48 --> 4075.599
if you go through it

4074.48 --> 4079.28
most

4075.599 --> 4081.92
people's most nations get destroyed

4079.28 --> 4081.92
utterly

4082.64 --> 4087.0389999999998
like there's nothing left of that after

4085.359 --> 4089.2799999999997
afterward

4087.039 --> 4091.6800000000003
it just crumbles

4089.28 --> 4094.88
but yeah russia did

4091.68 --> 4097.5199999999995
actually manage to get out of it

4094.88 --> 4097.52
somehow

4100.799 --> 4107.839
yeah until russia takes over the united

4103.12 --> 4109.04
goods i want them to have it

4107.839 --> 4112.359
take it

4109.04 --> 4112.359
take it

4117.899 --> 4121.6
[Music]

4120.48 --> 4123.199
trust me

4121.6 --> 4126.719
like

4123.199 --> 4129.678999999999
you have in america you have no idea

4126.719 --> 4129.679
no idea

4130.0 --> 4134.64
if russia actually just somehow managed

4132.64 --> 4136.88
to like literally take control of the

4134.64 --> 4139.359
government maybe they're just going to

4136.88 --> 4142.4800000000005
they would have plenty enough reason

4139.359 --> 4145.120000000001
basically do a direct covert war against

4142.48 --> 4147.04
like the political system

4145.12 --> 4149.199
like a direct

4147.04 --> 4151.6
very quick assault

4149.199 --> 4153.678999999999
when like yeah

4151.6 --> 4155.4400000000005
i mean i could see that russia might

4153.679 --> 4157.92
actually just take over the united

4155.44 --> 4160.799
states and when they do

4157.92 --> 4163.1990000000005
you're going to be better off

4160.799 --> 4167.12
it's not even a joke yeah oh you're

4163.199 --> 4169.839
precious right all that [ __ ] story

4167.12 --> 4172.239
that make you did nothing

4169.839 --> 4174.239
oh it's going to be hurt a little yeah

4172.239 --> 4176.879999999999
but guess what russia's going to be a

4174.239 --> 4180.159
lot better better as a government than

4176.88 --> 4181.679
what you got now a lot

4180.159 --> 4183.759
better

4181.679 --> 4186.719
so pray

4183.759 --> 4189.839
they take over your country

4186.719 --> 4189.839
i'm not joking

4204.239 --> 4209.199
you already have control yeah sure go

4206.64 --> 4210.2390000000005
squirt for me cow apple yes because you

4209.199 --> 4212.32
know

4210.239 --> 4215.04
it's all them they were actually doing

4212.32 --> 4216.88
all of this it's not the people doing it

4215.04 --> 4219.36
it's them

4216.88 --> 4220.400000000001
the russians did it right right you [ __ ]

4219.36 --> 4222.0
wit

4220.4 --> 4223.92
why don't you say that putin did it

4222.0 --> 4225.92
putin did it right

4223.92 --> 4227.36
you know somebody else is saying that

4225.92 --> 4229.12
biden

4227.36 --> 4231.599999999999
yeah

4229.12 --> 4235.84
so you're effectively

4231.6 --> 4235.84
arguing for biden's point

4235.88 --> 4241.1990000000005
congratulations brilliant

4238.4 --> 4245.08
i bet you really did some elaborate

4241.199 --> 4245.08
research on that point

4249.52 --> 4254.64
okay well you don't see any difference i

4252.0 --> 4257.52
guess you stabbed your eyes out then you

4254.64 --> 4258.4800000000005
you lost the will to see

4257.52 --> 4260.8
yeah

4258.48 --> 4262.718999999999
a lot of people have they don't want to

4260.8 --> 4266.0
see anymore

4262.719 --> 4271.2390000000005
they just don't want any involvement

4266.0 --> 4271.239
they'd rather die and they will

4272.56 --> 4278.2390000000005
ignorance is very bliss

4275.52 --> 4281.2390000000005
and leads to death

4278.239 --> 4281.239
prematurely

4285.199 --> 4290.639999999999
no nathan r he's not joking he's just

4287.6 --> 4290.64
being a dumbass

4292.32 --> 4297.04
saying it's all the same it's all the

4294.199 --> 4300.719
governments they're not really people

4297.04 --> 4303.6
they're all one giant vacant satanic

4300.719 --> 4305.44
robot that just doses their program

4303.6 --> 4307.52
that's what you think right yeah yeah

4305.44 --> 4310.4
yeah that's what happens when you

4307.52 --> 4312.64
chalk down [ __ ]

4310.4 --> 4315.199
let somebody [ __ ] in your mouth and you

4312.64 --> 4317.6
just accept it yeah yeah conspiracy

4315.199 --> 4320.96
videos all oh they're so much better

4317.6 --> 4322.56
because their story contradicts what the

4320.96 --> 4325.36
government says

4322.56 --> 4328.400000000001
well they're so exciting oh make such

4325.36 --> 4332.159
good points so well researched i mean

4328.4 --> 4334.48
it's all logical so you just accept it

4332.159 --> 4337.759999999999
and then it average it all blends in

4334.48 --> 4341.44
your mind but you didn't reject any of

4337.76 --> 4343.12
it it's all garbage it's all just random

4341.44 --> 4345.678999999999
suggestions

4343.12 --> 4348.4
upon more random suggestions it's a

4345.679 --> 4351.52
suggestion ponzi scheme and at the end

4348.4 --> 4354.48
of it it's all one giant monolithic

4351.52 --> 4356.320000000001
system they're all possessed by satan

4354.48 --> 4358.959999999999
none of them are even people they might

4356.32 --> 4361.92
be robots blah blah blah blah blah blah

4358.96 --> 4365.28
blah blah blah blah blah blah [ __ ]

4361.92 --> 4367.679
it's all [ __ ]

4365.28 --> 4369.199
they're people

4367.679 --> 4370.4
they do things

4369.199 --> 4374.4
they're different

4370.4 --> 4376.799999999999
from other people that do things

4374.4 --> 4379.199
you need to stop watching [ __ ]

4376.8 --> 4381.52
conspiracy videos

4379.199 --> 4384.239
that just exaggerate more and more and

4381.52 --> 4386.4800000000005
more until just becomes this insane

4384.239 --> 4389.28
science fiction story in your head it

4386.48 --> 4391.839999999999
has nothing to do with reality

4389.28 --> 4393.28
none of it is empirical none of it is

4391.84 --> 4395.84
proven

4393.28 --> 4398.4
and you're just taking it

4395.84 --> 4402.32
like a dick in the ass you're just

4398.4 --> 4404.0
taking it for granted you're an idiot

4402.32 --> 4405.12
you're an idiot if you believe all of

4404.0 --> 4407.199
that

4405.12 --> 4409.679
doesn't

4407.199 --> 4413.28
it's not real

4409.679 --> 4415.92
it's all fantasy garbage they come out

4413.28 --> 4417.84
of conspiracy nutters

4415.92 --> 4422.4400000000005
they just like to make up more

4417.84 --> 4422.4400000000005
interesting stories to get more clicks

4438.64 --> 4442.84
yeah

4441.28 --> 4446.2789999999995
yeah

4442.84 --> 4446.279
[Music]

4452.08 --> 4457.92
that's right blackrock and vanguard much

4455.12 --> 4460.32
bigger problem

4457.92 --> 4462.0
i mean the corporate

4460.32 --> 4464.4
competition

4462.0 --> 4465.52
with the actual governments and of the

4464.4 --> 4467.199
nations

4465.52 --> 4470.4800000000005
is a much

4467.199 --> 4470.48
bigger problem

4471.28 --> 4476.48
they're like the new robber barons you

4474.0 --> 4479.199
understand you know how much power the

4476.48 --> 4482.718999999999
robber barons actually had because they

4479.199 --> 4486.32
didn't have to account to [ __ ] they just

4482.719 --> 4488.2390000000005
did whatever the [ __ ] they wanted

4486.32 --> 4492.48
you understand

4488.239 --> 4494.48
that's a bigger problem than governments

4492.48 --> 4496.718999999999
yeah

4494.48 --> 4498.799999999999
stop being a [ __ ]

4496.719 --> 4499.92
and get real

4498.8 --> 4501.4400000000005
government

4499.92 --> 4504.0
is good

4501.44 --> 4505.759999999999
it's just that certain type of people in

4504.0 --> 4509.12
those governments are extremely

4505.76 --> 4511.4400000000005
corrupted and has metastasized over time

4509.12 --> 4513.92
and now most of it is corrupted that's

4511.44 --> 4516.5599999999995
not the government that's the people in

4513.92 --> 4518.2390000000005
the government abusing the system a

4516.56 --> 4519.76
system that's good

4518.239 --> 4522.718999999999
it's effective

4519.76 --> 4526.2390000000005
it was created by people

4522.719 --> 4527.52
that wanted things to work out you

4526.239 --> 4530.639999999999
understand

4527.52 --> 4531.84
and these satanic scumbags with their

4530.64 --> 4534.719
corruption

4531.84 --> 4538.0
and their recklessness and carelessness

4534.719 --> 4540.2390000000005
are literally making you destroy that

4538.0 --> 4543.36
government that is good so that you

4540.239 --> 4545.759999999999
reject it and then you have nothing you

4543.36 --> 4549.5199999999995
have nothing left

4545.76 --> 4550.8
but some freaking mega organization like

4549.52 --> 4554.080000000001
blackrock

4550.8 --> 4556.88
or vanguard or the un

4554.08 --> 4559.04
to then tell you what to do and there's

4556.88 --> 4562.0
nothing you can do about it because you

4559.04 --> 4565.239
don't have rights anymore

4562.0 --> 4565.239
you understand

4566.56 --> 4574.159000000001
stop blaming government it's the people

4570.32 --> 4576.639999999999
in the government not the government

4574.159 --> 4579.839999999999
get those people out

4576.64 --> 4581.92
get new people in make sure they don't

4579.84 --> 4585.67
corrupt and you're good

4581.92 --> 4585.67
[Music]

4592.8 --> 4596.159000000001
getting all fired up here

4598.08 --> 4602.4
put on this very very noisy fan

4603.28 --> 4606.28
huh

4644.96 --> 4648.0
no

4646.0 --> 4651.239
gadget inspectors

4648.0 --> 4651.239
no thanks

4651.6 --> 4655.6
why would i do that it's like krill oil

4653.52 --> 4657.92
why would i do that right now that's the

4655.6 --> 4657.92
point

4658.32 --> 4661.92
the only right moment to take that is

4660.239 --> 4663.5199999999995
before going to sleep

4661.92 --> 4665.76
yeah i can't hear the fan i know it was

4663.52 --> 4668.320000000001
a pleasant surprise

4665.76 --> 4668.320000000001
that uh

4669.44 --> 4673.36
the noise filter

4671.199 --> 4676.36
was able to take that out it's pretty

4673.36 --> 4676.36
awesome

4684.0 --> 4689.04
right so corrupt now we can even certain

4686.8 --> 4691.679
be certain voting is in riga and

4689.04 --> 4694.8
sometimes yeah that's right pj c net

4691.679 --> 4696.4
and that's that's when the real second

4694.8 --> 4698.0
amendment comes in

4696.4 --> 4700.48
that's when you've got to get your

4698.0 --> 4703.76
torches and your pitch forks and your

4700.48 --> 4706.159
bayonets and your muskets or your

4703.76 --> 4708.320000000001
machine guns or rocket launchers that

4706.159 --> 4710.239
you can print out now or hey even your

4708.32 --> 4714.719
fighter jets if you want

4710.239 --> 4717.759999999999
and then you [ __ ] slay them

4714.719 --> 4720.32
and then replace the government yeah

4717.76 --> 4724.64
that's the second amendment that is what

4720.32 --> 4726.32
the second amendment actually is for

4724.64 --> 4728.2390000000005
yeah

4726.32 --> 4732.0
people in government

4728.239 --> 4736.08
should not be protected you see they

4732.0 --> 4738.48
should specifically not be protected

4736.08 --> 4740.5599999999995
in my personal opinion

4738.48 --> 4743.199
i don't know how many people agree with

4740.56 --> 4743.1990000000005
that or not

4743.28 --> 4749.44
people working in government should be

4745.76 --> 4750.2390000000005
on average punished more severely by the

4749.44 --> 4754.239
law

4750.239 --> 4754.239
than non-government people

4757.12 --> 4761.36
and hey in my country i'm even

4759.6 --> 4762.8
personally not that anybody's gonna

4761.36 --> 4764.239
agree with that here because they're all

4762.8 --> 4766.159000000001
[ __ ] wussies

4764.239 --> 4768.879999999999
i'm actually quite convinced that we

4766.159 --> 4771.44
should specifically reintroduce the

4768.88 --> 4773.679
death penalty for politicians

4771.44 --> 4776.879999999999
exclusively

4773.679 --> 4779.04
yeah don't need it for anything else

4776.88 --> 4781.679
but maybe in the spirit of the second

4779.04 --> 4783.12
amendment we should have a specific

4781.679 --> 4786.2390000000005
death penalty

4783.12 --> 4786.239
for politicians

4786.4 --> 4791.04
yeah

4788.239 --> 4794.32
because they are the problem

4791.04 --> 4798.159
not the government it's the politicians

4794.32 --> 4799.599999999999
and they don't stop until you literally

4798.159 --> 4801.199
kill them

4799.6 --> 4802.719
because that's the only thing that makes

4801.199 --> 4804.719
them stop

4802.719 --> 4806.8
they're riding

4804.719 --> 4811.6
on the assumption that nobody's going to

4806.8 --> 4813.92
do anything about them and so you kill

4811.6 --> 4813.92
them

4814.08 --> 4819.28
that's the only way to get rid of them

4817.28 --> 4820.96
because they're not gonna go away

4819.28 --> 4822.4
they're just gonna make things worse and

4820.96 --> 4824.56
worse and worse and worse and they're

4822.4 --> 4826.08
gonna seduce more people and stupid

4824.56 --> 4828.2390000000005
things that are gonna make things worse

4826.08 --> 4829.84
and worse and worse and that's what they

4828.239 --> 4830.959999999999
do now

4829.84 --> 4832.4800000000005
these

4830.96 --> 4834.0
infiltrating

4832.48 --> 4835.5199999999995
anti-national

4834.0 --> 4837.199
scumbags

4835.52 --> 4839.280000000001
political traitors

4837.199 --> 4841.919999999999
so what do you do

4839.28 --> 4844.239
you drag them out

4841.92 --> 4849.6
of their position you arrest them you

4844.239 --> 4854.0
put in trials and then you execute them

4849.6 --> 4856.08
[ __ ] life in prison they have to die why

4854.0 --> 4858.159
because if you leave them in prison

4856.08 --> 4860.719
they're still gonna have their [ __ ]

4858.159 --> 4865.5599999999995
little influence you see that's why they

4860.719 --> 4865.56
actually need to die

4877.52 --> 4883.719
that's right political squid game it's

4879.84 --> 4883.719
hilarious by the way

4892.8 --> 4897.679
i'm gonna take a bit of a breather

4894.88 --> 4900.719
need some fresh air this excitement is

4897.679 --> 4905.2390000000005
just making me more hot

4900.719 --> 4905.2390000000005
i said what i needed to say anyway

4922.0 --> 4925.0
uh

4936.239 --> 4940.799999999999
oh the temperature is so much better out

4938.32 --> 4940.799999999999
here now

4942.8 --> 4948.400000000001
it's really nice outside now

4946.32 --> 4951.199
it's a nice shadow on the balcony and

4948.4 --> 4953.28
it's just ah

4951.199 --> 4955.599999999999
it's like put a

4953.28 --> 4959.84
a couple of towels there and just lie on

4955.6 --> 4959.84
the balcony that would be great

4962.32 --> 4967.44
okay turret yeah yeah that's okay that's

4965.44 --> 4968.799999999999
a bit

4967.44 --> 4971.12
a bit

4968.8 --> 4971.12
quick

4971.36 --> 4975.28
probably very indian

4974.48 --> 4978.239
yeah

4975.28 --> 4981.5199999999995
but you know what i'll just say that

4978.239 --> 4983.759999999999
if you do that sort of [ __ ] in india

4981.52 --> 4985.6
i'm not even gonna call you barbarian

4983.76 --> 4988.0
for it

4985.6 --> 4991.52
alright i don't mean i don't really want

4988.0 --> 4996.199
it to be that extreme here

4991.52 --> 4996.1990000000005
but i get it now i get it

5023.44 --> 5027.919999999999
right and the funny thing about it is or

5025.84 --> 5029.4400000000005
well is it really funny the other side

5027.92 --> 5032.719
is that yeah

5029.44 --> 5035.919999999999
when a politician is actually a good guy

5032.719 --> 5037.76
actually good and really like pro their

5035.92 --> 5039.84
people

5037.76 --> 5042.159000000001
every wants to make things better wants

5039.84 --> 5043.76
to help out when they're actually doing

5042.159 --> 5045.839999999999
good

5043.76 --> 5046.8
then that's that's never gonna happen

5045.84 --> 5048.08
you see

5046.8 --> 5050.639
because now

5048.08 --> 5054.4
there will be people actually fighting

5050.639 --> 5054.400000000001
with their lives to defend him

5054.88 --> 5059.04
i mean there might be like a political

5057.28 --> 5060.48
struggle because yeah satan's still

5059.04 --> 5061.92
going to have their minions and they're

5060.48 --> 5063.678999999999
going to probably send them after the

5061.92 --> 5067.28
good politicians right

5063.679 --> 5070.719
good politicians on average have much

5067.28 --> 5072.719
more grass root defense against that

5070.719 --> 5075.84
sort of thing

5072.719 --> 5079.36
the evil ones only have

5075.84 --> 5082.400000000001
gaslighting and intimidation

5079.36 --> 5084.239
and money usually and cops and whatever

5082.4 --> 5086.08
hired soldiers that would just do

5084.239 --> 5088.5599999999995
anything for that money

5086.08 --> 5091.92
right maybe blackmail

5088.56 --> 5094.400000000001
but yeah good politicians will

5091.92 --> 5096.719
also face such dangers but they will

5094.4 --> 5099.679
have a lot of people that will be like

5096.719 --> 5100.639
screw you this one's ours

5099.679 --> 5104.0
right

5100.639 --> 5104.0
so it works out

5108.719 --> 5112.0
right

5109.679 --> 5114.88
a bit like trump and he's not perfect by

5112.0 --> 5117.04
a long shot but he had that effect

5114.88 --> 5120.719
you know it it's just people that are

5117.04 --> 5123.719
like you're not gonna take our trump

5120.719 --> 5123.719
right

5127.52 --> 5130.52
um

5155.76 --> 5162.08
okay that's getting very dark tara don't

5158.159 --> 5163.92
don't seduce me on that [ __ ] i know

5162.08 --> 5166.48
i know

5163.92 --> 5168.88
but at some point it's just not about

5166.48 --> 5171.04
making them pay anymore it's just about

5168.88 --> 5172.2390000000005
making them stop

5171.04 --> 5174.159
right

5172.239 --> 5175.759999999999
i mean

5174.159 --> 5177.44
it's not worth it

5175.76 --> 5179.52
after a certain level they've just

5177.44 --> 5181.678999999999
tumbled so deeply in the darkness that

5179.52 --> 5182.639
you can never make up for it you could

5181.679 --> 5185.28
never

5182.639 --> 5188.56
make them experience enough anguish to

5185.28 --> 5189.44
even out what they've done you see

5188.56 --> 5191.6
that's

5189.44 --> 5194.879999999999
the sliding slope of the darkness once

5191.6 --> 5196.4800000000005
you really slide off there is no limit

5194.88 --> 5198.4800000000005
there's people out there that have done

5196.48 --> 5200.638999999999
so many atrocious things

5198.48 --> 5203.678999999999
nothing could ever be done in the world

5200.639 --> 5203.679
to even that out

5204.719 --> 5207.04
right

5208.32 --> 5213.92
even when i suggest like getting really

5211.04 --> 5215.12
brutal and [ __ ] and like

5213.92 --> 5217.84
painful

5215.12 --> 5220.639
it's not even about making them pay it's

5217.84 --> 5223.679
about a deterrent that's what it's about

5220.639 --> 5228.0
it's about showing the other [ __ ]

5223.679 --> 5230.639
conspiracy politicians scumbags like hey

5228.0 --> 5233.12
you want to try it next we got another

5230.639 --> 5236.4800000000005
pyre for you you want to try it

5233.12 --> 5239.12
huh why'd you try it see how that goes

5236.48 --> 5242.4
huh you want that power

5239.12 --> 5244.08
go try it out right that's

5242.4 --> 5245.839999999999
what i'll do it for

5244.08 --> 5248.639
not because i

5245.84 --> 5250.400000000001
gotta pay for what they don't know i

5248.639 --> 5252.2390000000005
want to make them suffer because that

5250.4 --> 5255.04
doesn't lead into anything it's not

5252.239 --> 5258.799999999999
productive it doesn't actually only just

5255.04 --> 5260.96
create more wounds in the people

5258.8 --> 5262.159000000001
right

5260.96 --> 5265.88
it's about

5262.159 --> 5265.879999999999
brutal deterrent

5266.88 --> 5272.08
they gotta know oh you you wanna get

5269.28 --> 5274.639
that power there's a little price to pay

5272.08 --> 5275.44
huh huh you wanna end up on that buyer

5274.639 --> 5280.1990000000005
too

5275.44 --> 5280.199
oh i hope it's worth it for you

5283.04 --> 5286.32
that's what it's for

5286.719 --> 5290.159
not to get even

5288.48 --> 5292.5599999999995
because you can't

5290.159 --> 5296.4
people that eventually would end up on

5292.56 --> 5296.400000000001
such as in such fate

5297.36 --> 5300.4
you can't even it

5300.639 --> 5303.84
it's not going to take all the

5301.92 --> 5306.2390000000005
atrocities away that they did it's not

5303.84 --> 5308.96
going to take away the victims

5306.239 --> 5312.718999999999
of their atrocities is not actually

5308.96 --> 5312.719
going to make it go away you see

5312.8 --> 5318.159000000001
so the only thing that you can do with

5315.36 --> 5320.159
it really is create a deterrent for

5318.159 --> 5322.4
future scenarios

5320.159 --> 5324.08
to prevent such things from happening

5322.4 --> 5327.28
again because now

5324.08 --> 5330.639
it's public this is the price

5327.28 --> 5330.639
and we're not wussies

5334.96 --> 5337.84
right

5341.6 --> 5349.159000000001
the control i didn't even use that word

5345.199 --> 5349.159
and put words in my mouth

5356.719 --> 5360.2390000000005
oh wait you were addressing territ never

5359.36 --> 5363.239
mind

5360.239 --> 5363.239
uh

5368.719 --> 5372.8
dude

5370.159 --> 5375.12
trudeau dude they just need to give him

5372.8 --> 5377.76
the old-fashioned canadian banishment

5375.12 --> 5379.36
they just need to put him on

5377.76 --> 5381.4400000000005
unlike a

5379.36 --> 5383.5199999999995
a piece of ice and break it off and just

5381.44 --> 5386.0
send him to the north pole that's what

5383.52 --> 5389.120000000001
they need to do with trudeau

5386.0 --> 5389.12
as for tradition

5389.6 --> 5396.679
according to south park anyway whatever

5393.44 --> 5396.678999999999
i think

5406.639 --> 5409.52
if you know what i mean

5411.28 --> 5417.44
but yeah trudeau is a nightmare guy he

5414.159 --> 5420.759999999999
is probably just as terrible as like our

5417.44 --> 5420.759999999999
dutch politicians

5421.04 --> 5425.04
he is on that level kind of terrible

5432.88 --> 5439.84
like as in a complete soulless

5436.96 --> 5442.96
yeah psychopath

5439.84 --> 5445.6
or at least sociopath but just like

5442.96 --> 5446.56
completely unfazed by the darkness that

5445.6 --> 5449.04
he does

5446.56 --> 5452.8
and like with pride like oh see i am

5449.04 --> 5454.48
good enough for the ruling elite

5452.8 --> 5456.400000000001
because that's the attitude they have

5454.48 --> 5459.678999999999
you know

5456.4 --> 5462.638999999999
they think that like just being

5459.679 --> 5466.08
mercilessly manipulative and lying

5462.639 --> 5468.96
had just having the control

5466.08 --> 5470.4
makes them deserve the power it is might

5468.96 --> 5473.44
makes right

5470.4 --> 5476.48
it is fascism might makes right but the

5473.44 --> 5478.799999999999
might is not at the barrel of a gun it

5476.48 --> 5480.638999999999
is through psychological warfare that is

5478.8 --> 5484.0
how they operate is how the new world

5480.639 --> 5487.04
order operate might makes right

5484.0 --> 5489.199
might of the mind over others

5487.04 --> 5490.639
right they don't use weapons anymore

5489.199 --> 5493.04
they don't just shoot people in the

5490.639 --> 5495.84
streets

5493.04 --> 5497.76
they now just [ __ ] them up mentally they

5495.84 --> 5498.8
just take away everything that would

5497.76 --> 5502.04
help them

5498.8 --> 5502.04
be self-sufficient

5510.8 --> 5514.84
yeah tony witkin right now

5521.44 --> 5525.5199999999995
all right but look this politicians

5524.32 --> 5526.88
what they're just trying to do is

5525.52 --> 5529.360000000001
they're just trying to make a new

5526.88 --> 5531.6
nobility class out of themselves right

5529.36 --> 5533.92
except instead of nobility it's now

5531.6 --> 5538.0
politicians so they're trying to make

5533.92 --> 5540.0
politicians into the new nobility class

5538.0 --> 5544.76
it's like their nobility but it's not

5540.0 --> 5544.76
official but effectively they are

5563.44 --> 5569.678999999999
and i'm getting really hungry

5566.639 --> 5569.679
i'm gonna have a nice

5570.719 --> 5574.4
big

5572.639 --> 5576.0
open big

5574.4 --> 5579.759999999999
piece of bread

5576.0 --> 5581.6
belt and then some salami tomato and

5579.76 --> 5585.4800000000005
chili pepper on there

5581.6 --> 5585.4800000000005
looking forward to it

5599.52 --> 5602.52
hmm

5606.7 --> 5609.898999999999
[Music]

5615.84 --> 5617.92
you

5638.639 --> 5644.0
oh okay

5640.719 --> 5646.2390000000005
you were having a

5644.0 --> 5646.239
wait

5649.04 --> 5655.36
are you having that like in the morning

5652.32 --> 5655.36
where are you tony

5656.4 --> 5663.159
are you in england or something

5659.679 --> 5663.159
having a lunch

5682.08 --> 5687.84
that grappler elites yeah i like to call

5684.159 --> 5687.839999999999
them growlers too

5692.8 --> 5698.400000000001
just trying to learn who will go [ __ ]

5694.719 --> 5699.679
yourself it's not specific

5698.4 --> 5701.839999999999
yeah

5699.679 --> 5703.92
i mean yeah you could name names but

5701.84 --> 5706.2390000000005
then you'd have to explain the entire

5703.92 --> 5707.28
context so sometimes

5706.239 --> 5712.48
it's just

5707.28 --> 5715.28
no it's just controllers it's a type

5712.48 --> 5718.48
yeah it's like these types you can find

5715.28 --> 5722.639
them everywhere and yeah if you really

5718.48 --> 5724.959999999999
need to prove it yeah you could probably

5722.639 --> 5726.719
name very specific names and explain

5724.96 --> 5728.96
exactly why and then it would take

5726.719 --> 5729.84
another hour

5728.96 --> 5732.4800000000005
okay

5729.84 --> 5734.8
it would take an extra hour just because

5732.48 --> 5737.36
you're trying to learn who

5734.8 --> 5738.8
which is not the conversation it's not

5737.36 --> 5741.92
about who

5738.8 --> 5743.360000000001
it's about how what what do they do how

5741.92 --> 5747.52
do they do it

5743.36 --> 5747.5199999999995
it's not specific you understand

5749.52 --> 5755.2390000000005
yeah derpcon one that's a good one

5752.08 --> 5755.239
it is

5782.08 --> 5786.5599999999995
you just woke up from sleep what

5784.8 --> 5790.639
when

5786.56 --> 5790.639
you mean right before my show or

5791.04 --> 5796.48
or did you fall asleep in between

5794.639 --> 5800.0
because i thought that i saw you earlier

5796.48 --> 5802.5599999999995
though wait i didn't know anything

5800.0 --> 5804.96
oh yeah you're right

5802.56 --> 5809.400000000001
you came in halfway

5804.96 --> 5809.4
right when it was getting all heated up

5876.08 --> 5878.4
right

5878.719 --> 5883.84
so yeah i think i said enough about all

5880.8 --> 5883.84
that stuff

5885.84 --> 5890.52
it's funny how the conversation

5887.52 --> 5890.52
developed

5913.119 --> 5916.119
okay

5931.92 --> 5936.88
you can really treat yeah you do seeking

5934.0 --> 5939.44
it's just that it's women

5936.88 --> 5942.08
i mean the one that's actually doing

5939.44 --> 5943.919999999999
that are probably like anti-female

5942.08 --> 5945.199
[ __ ]

5943.92 --> 5948.4800000000005
yeah

5945.199 --> 5950.239
i'm not even joking they probably hate

5948.48 --> 5952.48
all women

5950.239 --> 5953.5199999999995
actually really hate them and they're

5952.48 --> 5956.159
gay

5953.52 --> 5959.6
so they're constantly harassing men

5956.159 --> 5962.32
with homosexuality and they just hate

5959.6 --> 5965.1990000000005
bite at attack women

5962.32 --> 5967.44
bully them like harshly

5965.199 --> 5968.638999999999
right just look at the flatter scene in

5967.44 --> 5970.96
general

5968.639 --> 5973.52
look at how women are treated flat earth

5970.96 --> 5975.199
women by these same people

5973.52 --> 5977.52
they hate them

5975.199 --> 5980.638999999999
like they hate them a lot

5977.52 --> 5983.639
it's because they're all women hating

5980.639 --> 5983.639
[ __ ]

6015.92 --> 6020.08
bladders in government yeah good luck

6018.239 --> 6022.5599999999995
with that

6020.08 --> 6024.8
i mean it's still a freaking government

6022.56 --> 6026.96
okay you still have to understand how

6024.8 --> 6029.28
government operates

6026.96 --> 6030.96
his own benjamin says it and i

6029.28 --> 6033.04
agree with it

6030.96 --> 6035.199
it's there for the sinful it's there for

6033.04 --> 6039.28
the weak it's there for those that

6035.199 --> 6042.08
aren't fully in control over themselves

6039.28 --> 6044.8
and then to help them stabilize

6042.08 --> 6047.28
right to make sure that they don't cause

6044.8 --> 6049.52
actual damage

6047.28 --> 6052.159
that's what government does

6049.52 --> 6053.6
it's going to need lies for that

6052.159 --> 6056.48
the government's just going to be like

6053.6 --> 6058.4800000000005
oh yeah the earth's flat and the ballers

6056.48 --> 6061.759999999999
are dude what the [ __ ] are you going to

6058.48 --> 6061.759999999999
do with all the ballers

6063.36 --> 6066.799999999999
i mean

6064.48 --> 6068.718999999999
you want to start a philosophical

6066.8 --> 6071.360000000001
culture war

6068.719 --> 6073.679
because that's what's going to happen

6071.36 --> 6076.4
this is

6073.679 --> 6078.8
what you think by officially declaring

6076.4 --> 6081.839999999999
the earth to be flat that it's going to

6078.8 --> 6082.96
make the globe go away dude

6081.84 --> 6084.639
these are

6082.96 --> 6089.56
cultists

6084.639 --> 6089.56
multiple generation indoctrinated

6089.76 --> 6094.56
cultists

6091.28 --> 6096.639
and often savants added

6094.56 --> 6099.1990000000005
like they're not gonna go away what the

6096.639 --> 6100.2390000000005
hell are you gonna do with them

6099.199 --> 6101.839999999999
right

6100.239 --> 6104.839999999999
i don't think that the government can

6101.84 --> 6107.1990000000005
afford to basically declassify flat

6104.84 --> 6108.56
earth because

6107.199 --> 6110.719
what the hell are you going to do with

6108.56 --> 6112.8
these globers

6110.719 --> 6115.199
it's going to be a war

6112.8 --> 6116.719
they are going to go insane

6115.199 --> 6118.799999999999
and they're going to probably kill

6116.719 --> 6121.679
people

6118.8 --> 6125.1990000000005
much more much more satanically

6121.679 --> 6127.6
like the freaking supposed alleged

6125.199 --> 6130.96
school shooter type [ __ ] right they're

6127.6 --> 6132.159000000001
gonna go insane they're gonna implode

6130.96 --> 6136.2390000000005
inward

6132.159 --> 6136.239
become evil then

6136.719 --> 6141.76
if their lies are no longer entertained

6140.32 --> 6143.36
you see

6141.76 --> 6145.280000000001
so are you ready to deal with that you

6143.36 --> 6146.96
want that on top of everything else you

6145.28 --> 6149.84
want that on top of

6146.96 --> 6153.639
the problems we already got right now

6149.84 --> 6153.639
with the homosexual

6153.679 --> 6159.36
cultural degeneration

6156.639 --> 6162.400000000001
and the financial destabilization

6159.36 --> 6167.4
you want that on top there as well i

6162.4 --> 6167.4
don't i really really don't

6171.92 --> 6175.06
[Music]

6178.48 --> 6182.799999999999
bill is mad he out no phil bell is not

6181.52 --> 6185.84
banned here

6182.8 --> 6191.0
i think i didn't ban him did i

6185.84 --> 6191.0
i mean he never really goes that far

6194.239 --> 6199.36
bring it out in the open no

6196.4 --> 6202.638999999999
no no no

6199.36 --> 6205.36
let's stabilize the population first as

6202.639 --> 6207.1990000000005
in make it grow again because that is

6205.36 --> 6210.4
stabilizing

6207.199 --> 6212.5599999999995
yeah get back family unit

6210.4 --> 6214.159
promote that everything all that's

6212.56 --> 6217.84
necessary to do that

6214.159 --> 6220.638999999999
and then let's talk about maybe

6217.84 --> 6223.119000000001
maybe we could just make flat earth the

6220.639 --> 6226.08
classification the next issue because

6223.119 --> 6228.5599999999995
everything else is now fixed yeah that

6226.08 --> 6231.92
would be the time not in the middle of

6228.56 --> 6235.280000000001
this [ __ ] fest not in the middle of this

6231.92 --> 6239.96
giant eugenics war okay

6235.28 --> 6239.96
that would be a very ill advised

6247.36 --> 6252.48
uh how did him a seventh grade teacher

6250.159 --> 6252.48
okay

6254.719 --> 6258.76
did you out him

6260.639 --> 6265.1990000000005
what what are you talking about seeking

6262.159 --> 6267.599999999999
story you didn't do anything

6265.199 --> 6269.44
i mean he might have just been fired or

6267.6 --> 6272.159000000001
something did that what happened i don't

6269.44 --> 6274.239
know did something happen that's new

6272.159 --> 6276.32
i don't know what happened to phil will

6274.239 --> 6278.638999999999
i haven't heard of it

6276.32 --> 6279.759999999999
as far as i'm concerned he is just a

6278.639 --> 6281.1990000000005
teacher

6279.76 --> 6283.280000000001
to kids

6281.199 --> 6285.5199999999995
he believes in the globe that's it i

6283.28 --> 6287.28
don't know anything else

6285.52 --> 6289.92
got fired it's the first time i'm

6287.28 --> 6289.92
hearing of it

6298.239 --> 6303.5199999999995
that's ridiculous territ

6300.32 --> 6305.44
i mean seriously your fanaticism is now

6303.52 --> 6308.8
getting just ridiculous

6305.44 --> 6308.799999999999
it is ridiculous

6313.92 --> 6318.159
i mean dude if this is your attitude

6316.48 --> 6319.839999999999
what's next

6318.159 --> 6322.159
if you're gonna go by that level of

6319.84 --> 6323.92
fanaticism you're gonna realize it's

6322.159 --> 6326.32
never gonna stop

6323.92 --> 6328.0
you realize that when you go that

6326.32 --> 6330.96
hardcore

6328.0 --> 6333.119
you realize that that means that after

6330.96 --> 6338.0
that has been destroyed

6333.119 --> 6341.28
there will be need or a new thing to ban

6338.0 --> 6343.36
and destroy and punish yeah

6341.28 --> 6344.639
there's another group

6343.36 --> 6346.719
out there

6344.639 --> 6347.76
currently right now

6346.719 --> 6350.2390000000005
that is

6347.76 --> 6352.8
undergoing the same problems

6350.239 --> 6355.199
you might have taken notice of him yeah

6352.8 --> 6358.159000000001
they're called liberals

6355.199 --> 6360.96
they think they can ban everything they

6358.159 --> 6363.759999999999
think that they can erase

6360.96 --> 6365.199
naturally born opinions

6363.76 --> 6367.679
yeah

6365.199 --> 6369.36
you can't just do this you can't do it

6367.679 --> 6371.1990000000005
the way yet that you just described

6369.36 --> 6373.599999999999
there terror 306

6371.199 --> 6375.36
it doesn't work it always makes things

6373.6 --> 6377.360000000001
worse because after that there's going

6375.36 --> 6379.759999999999
to be a new thing

6377.36 --> 6382.32
that's now forbidden and another thing

6379.76 --> 6385.119000000001
and before you know you're all

6382.32 --> 6389.759999999999
leftist weenie boys

6385.119 --> 6390.5599999999995
afraid to open your mouth about anything

6389.76 --> 6393.88
yeah

6390.56 --> 6393.88
it's pointless

6407.76 --> 6412.320000000001
you can't ban a philosophy

6413.6 --> 6420.159000000001
you can ban it from being publicly

6417.44 --> 6422.239
allowed to be revealed just like you

6420.159 --> 6423.92
would ban the advertised public

6422.239 --> 6426.48
advertisement of

6423.92 --> 6429.04
of tobacco products right yeah you can

6426.48 --> 6431.678999999999
do that you can't just like say no

6429.04 --> 6433.679
nobody can ever say that ever now

6431.679 --> 6435.679
that's absurd

6433.679 --> 6439.0
that's what the left is doing right now

6435.679 --> 6439.0
it's terrible

6445.44 --> 6451.759999999999
ministry of dude

6448.48 --> 6454.08
dude listen to yourself darren listen to

6451.76 --> 6456.88
yourself do you even realize what the

6454.08 --> 6459.119
[ __ ] coming out of your mouth

6456.88 --> 6461.4400000000005
are you even realizing what you're

6459.119 --> 6463.92
saying right now

6461.44 --> 6466.96
do you want the founding of a ministry

6463.92 --> 6469.04
of truth do you realize what just came

6466.96 --> 6471.04
out of your mouth

6469.04 --> 6473.5199999999995
do you think about what comes out of

6471.04 --> 6473.5199999999995
your mouth

6476.88 --> 6481.52
it's a joke okay

6478.96 --> 6486.56
ha ha ha

6481.52 --> 6486.56
very [ __ ] funny not

6488.4 --> 6495.638999999999
that didn't even look like a joke

6491.6 --> 6495.639
what's a joke about it

6508.239 --> 6511.28
right tony we can

6517.679 --> 6521.52
they've hijacked the world yeah i know

6522.08 --> 6528.88
right but just to call them like

6524.56 --> 6531.52
anti-human satanists is a bit difficult

6528.88 --> 6533.28
a step to take for a lot of people

6531.52 --> 6535.92
but yes they are they effectively

6533.28 --> 6538.08
demon-possessed anti-humans

6535.92 --> 6540.88
like they'd kill themselves but they

6538.08 --> 6543.44
just want everybody to die

6540.88 --> 6543.4400000000005
instead

6545.92 --> 6548.2390000000005
right

6548.96 --> 6555.36
they just want everybody to die

6551.6 --> 6557.119000000001
that's what propels them

6555.36 --> 6559.598999999999
they're not liberal

6557.119 --> 6562.32
they're not even left they're just

6559.599 --> 6564.32
destroyers destroyers of all things of

6562.32 --> 6567.199
all cohesion of everything good of

6564.32 --> 6569.199
everything original all sensibility

6567.199 --> 6572.4
destroyers demons

6569.199 --> 6576.04
it's all categorized very succinctly in

6572.4 --> 6576.04
the word demon

6582.239 --> 6586.239
that's right psych bears

6585.119 --> 6587.199
you go

6586.239 --> 6589.598999999999
at it

6587.199 --> 6592.598999999999
in that way you become the turret that's

6589.599 --> 6592.599
right

6601.599 --> 6607.84
nature living to be part of yeah good

6604.159 --> 6608.719
luck with that territ how about just

6607.84 --> 6611.119000000001
look

6608.719 --> 6613.52
a good step would be

6611.119 --> 6616.0
global

6613.52 --> 6618.8
[ __ ] heliocentrism is no longer

6616.0 --> 6620.639
mandatory it is optional

6618.8 --> 6623.119000000001
right how about that

6620.639 --> 6627.76
i mean that's going to be a devastating

6623.119 --> 6630.4
blow to the globe religion devastating

6627.76 --> 6633.280000000001
to say like no you're not allowed to

6630.4 --> 6634.638999999999
that's just ridiculous

6633.28 --> 6635.679
that doesn't work you're going to create

6634.639 --> 6639.1990000000005
a war

6635.679 --> 6642.56
where that's not going to be one easily

6639.199 --> 6642.5599999999995
they're going to go berserk

6642.8 --> 6646.400000000001
right

6643.92 --> 6648.4800000000005
just say like oh it's just not mandated

6646.4 --> 6650.5599999999995
anymore

6648.48 --> 6652.5599999999995
and then yeah

6650.56 --> 6654.96
be a teacher become a teacher say like

6652.56 --> 6657.1990000000005
okay here we teach about flat earth no

6654.96 --> 6658.8
that's okay i mean

6657.199 --> 6660.159
there will be protests there will be

6658.8 --> 6662.159000000001
people like hey

6660.159 --> 6663.759999999999
why are you not teaching about the globe

6662.159 --> 6665.679
and you're like yeah because it is in

6663.76 --> 6667.76
the globe well

6665.679 --> 6669.679
we would like to debate that and then

6667.76 --> 6671.679
you go to the flat earth debates and

6669.679 --> 6673.92
then you hear the endless scatter

6671.679 --> 6675.04
gunning straw man at home fallacies

6673.92 --> 6677.76
right

6675.04 --> 6679.679
this is what gonna happen

6677.76 --> 6681.360000000001
you can't just say no you're not allowed

6679.679 --> 6685.04
to

6681.36 --> 6687.119
just take away the mandatory nature

6685.04 --> 6689.119
of the globe religion and just make it

6687.119 --> 6690.88
optional there will be kids that will be

6689.119 --> 6692.96
like hey but i want to learn about that

6690.88 --> 6694.639
ball i've seen it on tv

6692.96 --> 6696.56
well then teach them about it if they

6694.639 --> 6698.32
want to learn and teach them about it

6696.56 --> 6701.599
right

6698.32 --> 6704.32
just don't make it mandatory and don't

6701.599 --> 6707.4400000000005
ridicule flat earthers

6704.32 --> 6709.92
as a standardized system

6707.44 --> 6711.919999999999
right i mean all heliocentrists will

6709.92 --> 6713.76
always be scoffing at flat earthers

6711.92 --> 6716.0
that's only natural

6713.76 --> 6719.280000000001
they're their arch enemy they literally

6716.0 --> 6722.639
hold the key that physically

6719.28 --> 6724.0
mentally made the globe model right so

6722.639 --> 6726.08
yeah of course they're always going to

6724.0 --> 6728.88
oppose flat earthers

6726.08 --> 6731.76
just don't standardize that

6728.88 --> 6734.32
don't like force that [ __ ] in everything

6731.76 --> 6736.4800000000005
that everybody always has to ridicule

6734.32 --> 6739.44
flat earthers and it has to be a globe

6736.48 --> 6742.32
it's just like just take over just take

6739.44 --> 6744.799999999999
over for these religious nut cases

6742.32 --> 6748.08
go in their place

6744.8 --> 6748.08
and just do it your way

6748.84 --> 6756.32
right replace him i mean most ballers at

6753.52 --> 6758.56
this point are really boomers anyway

6756.32 --> 6760.48
anti-flat earther types look at the age

6758.56 --> 6761.360000000001
category of these people that we deal

6760.48 --> 6763.5199999999995
with

6761.36 --> 6764.88
do those look like young people on

6763.52 --> 6767.040000000001
average

6764.88 --> 6767.04
no

6767.36 --> 6770.0
no they don't

6770.159 --> 6774.638999999999
and the ones that are kind of young are

6772.48 --> 6777.44
really disgusting

6774.639 --> 6780.32
they're like disgusting individuals you

6777.44 --> 6782.96
can literally see it with your own eyes

6780.32 --> 6785.199
right most of them are like old people

6782.96 --> 6790.199
they're boomers

6785.199 --> 6790.199
most of these ball fanatics are boomers

6792.32 --> 6797.119
they're not a long-term threat they're

6794.4 --> 6800.389999999999
gonna die of old age

6797.119 --> 6803.599999999999
don't worry about it

6800.39 --> 6803.6
[Music]

6810.719 --> 6815.84
what god of tools

6812.96 --> 6818.2390000000005
proclaiming globe worship illegal that's

6815.84 --> 6821.400000000001
bizarre

6818.239 --> 6821.4
i disagree

6824.96 --> 6830.88
now if you'd say okay it's illegal globe

6828.08 --> 6832.48
worship is illegal in church i'd say

6830.88 --> 6834.159000000001
yeah

6832.48 --> 6836.32
absolutely

6834.159 --> 6838.879999999999
absolutely

6836.32 --> 6842.08
that should be forbidden in my opinion

6838.88 --> 6843.599
like it should absolutely be illegal

6842.08 --> 6847.28
to do that

6843.599 --> 6850.08
it feels like it's very wrong to do that

6847.28 --> 6854.32
god does not appreciate it

6850.08 --> 6854.32
but to in general make it illegal

6855.04 --> 6857.36
dude

6860.159 --> 6863.92
i mean keep dreaming and all but it's

6861.92 --> 6866.8
not gonna happen

6863.92 --> 6866.8
you're a boomer

6868.0 --> 6872.159
well there's also flat earth or boomers

6869.84 --> 6872.159000000001
i guess

6874.8 --> 6878.400000000001
right it's not because you're a boomer

6876.639 --> 6879.92
you're bad it's just i just want to make

6878.4 --> 6882.719
a point a lot of

6879.92 --> 6884.8
the anti-flat earthers that we deal with

6882.719 --> 6887.599
typically and then everybody deals with

6884.8 --> 6887.599
are boomers

6888.0 --> 6893.76
they're like older people that like

6890.719 --> 6896.639
really got sucked up in that cultural

6893.76 --> 6898.8
situated cultural war

6896.639 --> 6901.4400000000005
that resulted in the heliocentrism

6898.8 --> 6903.76
fanaticism

6901.44 --> 6906.32
because in their generation is when they

6903.76 --> 6909.280000000001
really weaponized it the most so these

6906.32 --> 6913.159
are like the first line soldiers

6909.28 --> 6913.159
of the result of that

6922.4 --> 6927.839999999999
hey adam price

6924.8 --> 6927.84
super late

6928.239 --> 6932.0
because i should already be i should

6930.239 --> 6935.239
have already ended the show like half an

6932.0 --> 6935.239
hour ago

6959.84 --> 6963.4400000000005
yeah i've been almost two hours that's

6961.52 --> 6967.4800000000005
right

6963.44 --> 6967.48
but i started very late

6985.599 --> 6992.679
my phil love the word silly

6989.36 --> 6992.679
but he does

7004.32 --> 7009.679
right but i'm gonna run out the show

7006.0 --> 7009.679
because i really want to get some lunch

7010.08 --> 7014.32
so thanks everyone for coming

7012.639 --> 7017.599
i hope you like this show i thought it

7014.32 --> 7020.719
was pretty good so yeah i was super

7017.599 --> 7022.8
passionate here and there

7020.719 --> 7024.719
i think yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna watch

7022.8 --> 7026.719
this back and see if this was actually

7024.719 --> 7027.84
an interesting show i'm still

7026.719 --> 7030.4
like

7027.84 --> 7033.28
i'm doing a lot of like personal

7030.4 --> 7037.36
feedback analysis as to like what it is

7033.28 --> 7039.679
like what am i what the hell is my show

7037.36 --> 7042.0
actually compared to other people's show

7039.679 --> 7043.1990000000005
like what is this what is this show that

7042.0 --> 7045.84
i do

7043.199 --> 7049.839999999999
because sometimes i'm still not entirely

7045.84 --> 7049.84
sure what it is that i actually do

7051.199 --> 7055.04
right

7052.0 --> 7058.0
i just know i got like

7055.04 --> 7060.639
yeah 1300 shows of it that's what i do

7058.0 --> 7062.48
know but what is this what is it

7060.639 --> 7065.1990000000005
actually that i do

7062.48 --> 7067.04
i mean i called it a workshop but

7065.199 --> 7069.04
it doesn't always seem to really be

7067.04 --> 7071.599
functioning like that sometimes it does

7069.04 --> 7073.44
and those times are awesome

7071.599 --> 7075.119000000001
but

7073.44 --> 7077.04
i don't know

7075.119 --> 7079.36
i'm still trying to figure out what it

7077.04 --> 7081.5199999999995
actually is that i do

7079.36 --> 7085.04
because i bring up so many different

7081.52 --> 7087.599
things and i lay it down in my way and

7085.04 --> 7089.84
this is all quite unusual in ways i

7087.599 --> 7089.84
think

7090.32 --> 7094.639
i mean i've never actually seen a show

7092.0 --> 7096.4
that was like whoa dude he does his

7094.639 --> 7098.639
shows just like me

7096.4 --> 7100.719
uh no

7098.639 --> 7102.56
i mean

7100.719 --> 7105.28
maybe

7102.56 --> 7107.360000000001
like dell from the imaginary curve could

7105.28 --> 7108.88
be somewhat

7107.36 --> 7113.199
considered

7108.88 --> 7114.8
to be similar to how i do it right a bit

7113.199 --> 7117.759999999999
but it's still very different he's a

7114.8 --> 7119.119000000001
different guy he does it his own

7117.76 --> 7121.280000000001
way

7119.119 --> 7122.88
but he's also just very straight in your

7121.28 --> 7126.32
face he doesn't give [ __ ] he's just

7122.88 --> 7129.04
gonna say it exactly how he wants it

7126.32 --> 7131.28
he he curses when he feels he wants to

7129.04 --> 7131.28
right

7131.679 --> 7136.08
i do too

7133.76 --> 7140.56
but i do it like i try to just do it

7136.08 --> 7140.5599999999995
responsibly it's for whatever that means

7140.84 --> 7144.400000000001
anyway

7142.4 --> 7146.4
