96.659 --> 98.96000000000001
nice

101.36 --> 108.06
this morning it was a lot more cloudy

104.04 --> 112.04
but now it's yeah clearing back up

108.06 --> 112.04
still seems kind of moist out there

114.54 --> 122.71900000000001
a little less Breeze was a lot more wind

118.38 --> 122.719

125.159 --> 127.28
there

133.5 --> 136.34
all right

143.76 --> 148.819
hello Tom Parker first in chat good to

156.84 --> 159.98
to our show today

165.48 --> 172.79999999999998
right yeah today's attention card at the

169.5 --> 176.9
attention card Freudian slip the title

172.8 --> 176.9
card today was very attention grabby

177.18 --> 181.739
also because yeah I did I couldn't

179.459 --> 184.2
really think of

181.739 --> 186.12
anything so this was kind of like an

184.2 --> 188.099
emergency card

186.12 --> 192.239
The Joker card

188.099 --> 194.33999999999997
thank you Adam meakin for helping me out

192.239 --> 196.92000000000002
it's very tough though to

194.34 --> 199.70000000000002
find something good

196.92 --> 199.7
every day

203.159 --> 209.599
so this is it and yeah it's based on a

205.98 --> 209.599
video where somebody basically

210.36 --> 216.68
Acts or whatnot acts uh does a really

213.84 --> 216.68
good voice over

219.9 --> 223.98000000000002
it was it was pretty funny but yeah

222.12 --> 226.92000000000002
obviously not real

223.98 --> 228.54
uh hello Rob l

226.92 --> 231.29899999999998
hello

228.54 --> 234.07999999999998
Flat Earth tracker

231.299 --> 235.86
see you Leonardo

234.08 --> 238.20000000000002
chavaria

235.86 --> 241.04000000000002
hello all kinds of new people in chat

238.2 --> 241.04
hello welcome

242.159 --> 244.159
um

249.36 --> 256.04
right so yeah I'm up to up for talking

252.84 --> 256.04
about pretty much anything

257.34 --> 260.34
foreign

272.06 --> 275.66
going around here

279.479 --> 283.28
I'll try to get him up

284.16 --> 288.84000000000003
as soon as he starts to sit still anyway

286.74 --> 292.08
yeah

288.84 --> 294.17999999999995
uh Flat Earth debates replay from Friday

292.08 --> 298.09999999999997
was very entertaining yesterday and

294.18 --> 298.1
Nathan also made a lot of separate clips

299.22 --> 305.28000000000003
because yeah that guy was just fully

301.5 --> 308.28
into cognitive dissonance a lot

305.28 --> 310.08
which is really what any Ballers that

308.28 --> 310.919
come on the Flat Earth debates these

310.08 --> 313.199
days

310.919 --> 318.479
they're really deep into that they're

313.199 --> 318.479
really dip into that mind set

321.06 --> 330.72
right also listen back yesterday's show

326.06 --> 333.0
and I noticed a distinct problem

330.72 --> 336.199
that really kind of ruined a lot of the

333.0 --> 336.199
sound and that was the

336.419 --> 341.75899999999996
the filter

339.18 --> 344.699
I really noticed it yesterday

341.759 --> 347.34000000000003
that like

344.699 --> 350.16
bits and pieces of everything I was

347.34 --> 352.73999999999995
saying was just cut off

350.16 --> 357.06
it was very annoying actually

352.74 --> 360.139
so yeah I'll have to know fed today what

357.06 --> 360.139
what are you talking about

363.36 --> 366.199
oh [ __ ]

369.06 --> 374.9
you see it you're right

372.18 --> 374.90000000000003
ah

379.139 --> 383.639
shame

380.819 --> 386.3
he's really looking forward to that

383.639 --> 386.3
hmm

390.96 --> 396.02
all right well there's still going to be

392.819 --> 396.02000000000004
replays No Doubt

399.0 --> 402.319
a good servant

402.66 --> 407.94
all right okay so I guess it's gonna be

404.88 --> 410.94
a little bit drifty

407.94 --> 410.94
fake

411.479 --> 414.08
whatever

433.259 --> 438.06
all right anyway I gotta be careful next

435.419 --> 441.24
time if there's gonna be noise

438.06 --> 443.28000000000003
out there that's disruptive I have to be

441.24 --> 445.5
very careful with the Noise Gate

443.28 --> 449.58
because apparently you got it

445.5 --> 449.58
really talk clearly

450.66 --> 457.34000000000003
pretty close to the mic to make sure

453.66 --> 457.34000000000003
that it doesn't like cut out

459.599 --> 463.56
because again yeah watching back

461.46 --> 466.44
yesterday's show like it

463.56 --> 469.199
an eighth or a sixteenth

466.44 --> 472.5
something there like just got chipped

469.199 --> 475.46000000000004
out of what I was saying making it kind

472.5 --> 475.46
of confusing at times

475.8 --> 480.72
so yeah that was a bit of a shame

478.68 --> 483.919
because other than that I thought that

480.72 --> 487.28000000000003
it was really on a roll yesterday

483.919 --> 487.28
but anyway

490.08 --> 495.56
Nathan is having his windows done

493.02 --> 495.56
okay

498.06 --> 503.599
you mean he's having new windows

500.879 --> 503.59900000000005
installs

513.12 --> 518.099
hello AGM by the way

515.399 --> 521.279
oh yeah hello Kristen

518.099 --> 524.839
yeah yeah the notifications can come in

521.279 --> 524.8389999999999
a little late sometimes but

526.74 --> 530.58
there's times where nobody gets

528.6 --> 533.82
notifications

530.58 --> 536.58
there's been periods like months on end

533.82 --> 539.7600000000001
where everybody specifically had to just

536.58 --> 542.1600000000001
at the right time click on my show to

539.76 --> 545.54
see if it was live same goes for

542.16 --> 545.54
Nathan's channels by the way

551.22 --> 556.62
right you can't just rely on

553.56 --> 559.38
notification pop-ups from YouTube to to

556.62 --> 562.86
get anywhere in time

559.38 --> 564.779
only works periodically and then it just

562.86 --> 567.66
starts lagging or not giving

564.779 --> 570.68
notifications and all this this has been

567.66 --> 570.68
happening for years

571.32 --> 575.5400000000001
hello Dr sailor good to see you

586.44 --> 592.8800000000001
it like Rob L is you're not Rob H are

590.76 --> 592.88
you

593.339 --> 599.4590000000001
I I don't know any Rob L yet you speak

596.459 --> 602.42
in my chat as if you've known me

599.459 --> 602.42
for some time

635.279 --> 640.4399999999999
right no you're not a Rob H because he

637.92 --> 643.5
actually has a wrench

640.44 --> 645.0
and if you had changed your name it

643.5 --> 647.399
would have changed

645.0 --> 650.88
you you would still retain the wrench

647.399 --> 650.88
right okay

655.62 --> 659.519
right

657.18 --> 662.779
now it's another guy so yeah hello

659.519 --> 662.779
welcome Rob l

670.86 --> 673.04
foreign

673.44 --> 682.22
so I do have some green tea again

677.579 --> 682.2199999999999
yesterday was just way too hot for that

685.26 --> 690.8
but I don't think it's currently 27

687.72 --> 690.8000000000001
degrees over here

693.779 --> 697.4399999999999
that's right 22.

698.04 --> 701.459
all right

699.24 --> 705.86
significant temperature drop it's a

701.459 --> 705.8599999999999
little bit more moist even 63 percent

711.8 --> 715.279
right so

731.76 --> 738.0
if I look around in the news

734.519 --> 740.42
it seems like the flash floods here in

738.0 --> 740.42
West Europe

741.36 --> 747.72
have yeah have all gone away

745.139 --> 750.1800000000001
so it really was a flash flood right if

747.72 --> 754.26
it's if it's yeah flash flood suddenly

750.18 --> 756.7199999999999
flooding usually due to extreme rain

754.26 --> 758.76
and then it goes away again still does a

756.72 --> 761.6600000000001
lot of damage but that's if I'm correct

758.76 --> 761.66
the flash flood

763.8 --> 768.42
and that's yeah I've seen footage of

765.839 --> 771.3000000000001
literally it all being cleaned up and

768.42 --> 773.8389999999999
all the trash being removed and [ __ ] in

771.3 --> 773.8389999999999
the streets

779.16 --> 784.4399999999999
I'm still thinking about it by the way

781.139 --> 786.839
like like how does that even happen and

784.44 --> 789.48
couldn't there be some

786.839 --> 792.9590000000001
piece of smart well thought out water

789.48 --> 794.94
engineering to basically help

792.959 --> 797.6389999999999
these regions when this sort of thing

794.94 --> 799.86
typically happens to prevent a lot of

797.639 --> 802.519
damage I'm just thinking about in the

799.86 --> 802.519
back of my mind

804.18 --> 808.399
the weather modification no

809.22 --> 814.0790000000001
no

810.839 --> 816.6800000000001
AGM no floods just happened there

814.079 --> 816.68
dude

822.18 --> 825.9799999999999
a long time listener okay

828.43 --> 831.51
[Music]

836.22 --> 839.48
it was just a

840.839 --> 845.94
well it happens periodically

844.079 --> 848.699
right

845.94 --> 850.8000000000001
like I remember many many times hearing

848.699 --> 853.279
the news that there's floods in West

850.8 --> 853.279
Germany

856.98 --> 861.8000000000001
I think that like every few years it

859.5 --> 861.8
happens

862.019 --> 866.22
it doesn't happen as often though in

863.94 --> 868.2600000000001
like the south of the Netherlands

866.22 --> 870.48
that's much more rare

868.26 --> 873.38
but like in West Germany that that

870.48 --> 873.38
constantly happens

876.12 --> 880.1
are you seeking star water good to see

877.92 --> 880.0999999999999
you

887.16 --> 892.199
huh okay so you can start water you got

889.32 --> 894.8000000000001
a heat spell over there

892.199 --> 894.8
hmm

912.66 --> 917.6
a slow-mo moon buggy good to see you

932.32 --> 938.339
[Music]

935.339 --> 938.339
foreign

939.019 --> 946.279
yesterday I was really annoying just the

942.54 --> 946.279
amount of mosquitoes everywhere

964.5 --> 969.839
so yeah hey guys any

966.959 --> 972.54
thoughts any Reflections maybe on things

969.839 --> 975.6
that I talked about yesterday

972.54 --> 978.0
any subject you'd like me to address or

975.6 --> 980.22
go through again

978.0 --> 982.16
let me know because I'm pretty much a

980.22 --> 985.38
blank slate

982.16 --> 989.42
which is kind of normal during this the

985.38 --> 989.42
first half hour of my show pretty much

996.48 --> 999.6800000000001
hello Ayers

1005.06 --> 1008.8389999999999
foreign

1006.56 --> 1012.6389999999999
what's happening in my world I don't

1008.839 --> 1012.639
know not not too many things

1023.18 --> 1029.0
currently I guess a little bit more on

1025.4 --> 1030.98
the frustrated side of my experience

1029.0 --> 1033.88
also because of that

1030.98 --> 1033.88
because if they

1034.699 --> 1037.699
rigidity

1038.36 --> 1045.3799999999999
of the Dynamics of my situation

1042.5 --> 1046.459
overall and it's very frustrating at

1045.38 --> 1050.2990000000002
times

1046.459 --> 1053.559
then I'm constantly like uh why did I

1050.299 --> 1053.559
do it all like this

1053.66 --> 1061.48
I do try to like Envision a lot

1057.02 --> 1061.48
like how in some way I could have like

1063.2 --> 1068.24
gone through a lot of that I went

1065.539 --> 1070.7
through in a better way so many moments

1068.24 --> 1073.16
that I now just start to much more

1070.7 --> 1075.4
Crystal Clear realize like oh man if I'd

1073.16 --> 1075.4
only

1076.52 --> 1081.86
if I'd only pushed a little harder on

1078.86 --> 1083.9799999999998
this towards myself and the world

1081.86 --> 1087.26
I might have been in a much better place

1083.98 --> 1090.02
like even not having all the foreign

1087.26 --> 1092.9
knowledge of well having gone through

1090.02 --> 1094.52
what is everything that's happened

1092.9 --> 1097.64
so yeah

1094.52 --> 1099.799
it's like I've just detected throughout

1097.64 --> 1101.7800000000002
my life a lot of like unconditional

1099.799 --> 1103.58
mistakes like mistakes that aren't

1101.78 --> 1107.0
because of lack of foreign knowledge but

1103.58 --> 1108.74
because it was just a blatant mistake

1107.0 --> 1111.74
and that really no matter how it would

1108.74 --> 1114.52
have turned out I should have

1111.74 --> 1114.52
done better

1123.799 --> 1127.16
all right

1125.059 --> 1129.32
instead of spending a lot of time like

1127.16 --> 1131.3600000000001
yeah yeah I did the best I could blah

1129.32 --> 1133.52
blah blah yeah I

1131.36 --> 1136.76
I really cannot

1133.52 --> 1141.22
rest myself in that position I just

1136.76 --> 1141.22
can't do it it's like I have to improve

1145.22 --> 1148.0
hey Cleary

1160.039 --> 1165.5
it's just like there's like I'll lay it

1163.58 --> 1167.36
down you know it's all in the past

1165.5 --> 1168.86
anyway this is all about money I don't

1167.36 --> 1172.9399999999998
have anymore

1168.86 --> 1176.1789999999999
but yeah when I when my mother died

1172.94 --> 1177.8600000000001
and the house was sold I did get a lot

1176.179 --> 1181.96
of money from that like the most I've

1177.86 --> 1181.9599999999998
ever had in a single Heap

1182.059 --> 1186.86
and

1183.44 --> 1189.2
I didn't know what to do with it and the

1186.86 --> 1191.78
world was getting very like they were

1189.2 --> 1193.28
getting aware of me having money and not

1191.78 --> 1196.24
really know what to do with it and it

1193.28 --> 1196.24
was like literally

1196.7 --> 1201.74
I could feel the hunger around me of

1199.4 --> 1205.8200000000002
people just wanting to get it out of my

1201.74 --> 1209.84
hands it wasn't not pleasant

1205.82 --> 1213.74
but I let that discourage me and that

1209.84 --> 1216.26
was bad that was really bad

1213.74 --> 1219.799
that was like

1216.26 --> 1223.1
shooting in myself in the foot level bat

1219.799 --> 1225.62
let that stop me because

1223.1 --> 1229.78
I absolutely should have just taken a

1225.62 --> 1229.78
chunk from that and just try to

1230.9 --> 1235.4
instead of

1232.72 --> 1238.039
exclusively focusing on my own skill

1235.4 --> 1241.539
development because that wasn't really

1238.039 --> 1241.539
the time for it that was just

1241.88 --> 1248.419
my way of escaping from my inabilities

1246.32 --> 1251.36
to deal with the situation and still

1248.419 --> 1252.7990000000002
getting something some development out

1251.36 --> 1255.32
of it right so that's like the

1252.799 --> 1258.559
consolidation price that I ascribed to

1255.32 --> 1260.96
myself in doing what I did I should have

1258.559 --> 1264.559
somehow gotten a grip on the money

1260.96 --> 1267.4
situation but I would have also then

1264.559 --> 1272.24
because of that time period

1267.4 --> 1276.3200000000002
obviously been confronted with potential

1272.24 --> 1281.059
Medical Corona conspiracy investment

1276.32 --> 1284.8999999999999
issues that I know was happening back

1281.059 --> 1287.48
then literally hearing that from people

1284.9 --> 1290.26
right and there was also this I was

1287.48 --> 1290.26
scared of that

1290.6 --> 1295.4189999999999
just

1292.28 --> 1295.4189999999999
I shouldn't have

1301.58 --> 1307.76
if I'd had at that time

1304.72 --> 1309.26
properly tried to build something with

1307.76 --> 1313.58
it

1309.26 --> 1316.58
then who knows I might have not been

1313.58 --> 1319.1
brought to this position now it's not

1316.58 --> 1320.72
that bad guys it's not that bad to do

1319.1 --> 1324.5
this show

1320.72 --> 1329.44
and to get around on your extra support

1324.5 --> 1329.44
like it's not the worst way to live

1330.44 --> 1336.0800000000002
what I could have prevented

1333.5 --> 1338.6
from getting to this position

1336.08 --> 1340.76
entirely I could have just been

1338.6 --> 1344.36
completely financially self-sufficient

1340.76 --> 1346.96
instead of where I'm at now and that I

1344.36 --> 1346.9599999999998
do regret

1349.22 --> 1354.5
I regretted a lot sometimes

1352.46 --> 1356.6000000000001
and then other times I'm like oh my God

1354.5 --> 1358.1
I'm so happy that I have all this

1356.6 --> 1360.74
freedom

1358.1 --> 1362.48
because I do have it

1360.74 --> 1364.4
space

1362.48 --> 1366.98
around me

1364.4 --> 1370.46
prolonged moments of silence and where I

1366.98 --> 1373.82
could just enjoy the beauty of creation

1370.46 --> 1376.46
and the more you get preoccupied

1373.82 --> 1378.7
with money issues the less you can enjoy

1376.46 --> 1378.7
that

1382.34 --> 1385.1789999999999
right anyway

1394.24 --> 1399.22
that sailor I don't know about that I've

1396.74 --> 1399.22
heard it

1399.44 --> 1405.02
it was it was spread around as a rumor

1402.679 --> 1407.96
to no end I've never actually seen it

1405.02 --> 1410.9189999999999
though and it hey Trump has had a lot of

1407.96 --> 1410.919
weird activity

1411.02 --> 1417.4
through his Twitter when

1414.29 --> 1417.3999999999999
[Music]

1419.9 --> 1423.4
did that for him or

1423.5 --> 1428.779
it's just in a

1426.08 --> 1430.8799999999999
in a random moment thought that was a

1428.779 --> 1434.179
good idea or something right it even if

1430.88 --> 1436.94
he actually had said that

1434.179 --> 1439.72
it does not hold weight

1436.94 --> 1439.72
not anymore

1439.94 --> 1444.0800000000002
after everything that's happened it's

1441.74 --> 1446.26
really insignificant

1444.08 --> 1446.26
foreign

1451.94 --> 1458.919
this was a year ago 2004 uh

1456.2 --> 1458.919
what

1462.26 --> 1470.48
uh that sailor it's 2021.

1467.0 --> 1470.48
not 2015.

1473.84 --> 1479.5
oh this was years okay right right okay

1476.84 --> 1479.5
never mind

1479.779 --> 1483.22
Overlook the s

1504.32 --> 1510.279
oh God yeah I got something to talk

1506.659 --> 1514.8200000000002
about did anybody see that

1510.279 --> 1518.08
crazy crazy technobabble video

1514.82 --> 1518.08
like God

1525.559 --> 1528.86
with

1527.12 --> 1531.4599999999998
what's it called again let me try to

1528.86 --> 1531.4599999999998
find it back

1538.52 --> 1541.299
where is it

1543.679 --> 1546.22
all right

1550.58 --> 1555.62
yeah with

1553.34 --> 1557.84
Santos

1555.62 --> 1561.5
and his

1557.84 --> 1563.48
project my god I've never seen an intro

1561.5 --> 1565.58
that cultish

1563.48 --> 1569.1200000000001
like that's the most cold thing I've

1565.58 --> 1571.3999999999999
ever seen as an intro

1569.12 --> 1572.2399999999998
and here yeah I had Ken wheeler on with

1571.4 --> 1575.6000000000001
him

1572.24 --> 1578.44
now I listened to that 25 minutes right

1575.6 --> 1578.4399999999998
yeah here it is

1579.86 --> 1585.1399999999999
adamy can actually posted that

1583.4 --> 1587.679
yesterday

1585.14 --> 1587.679
evening

1597.2 --> 1601.7
no it's not forbidden to mention ranty

1599.539 --> 1603.919
on this channel it is a complete waste

1601.7 --> 1608.26
of our time though

1603.919 --> 1608.26
Bad Karma so

1609.26 --> 1612.86
don't particularly appreciate it being

1611.659 --> 1615.3400000000001
brought up

1612.86 --> 1615.34
right

1618.74 --> 1624.32
anyway yeah that that video I watched 25

1622.279 --> 1627.7
minutes of it and then I just had to

1624.32 --> 1627.7
turn it off because it was gonna

1629.9 --> 1635.0590000000002
yeah I couldn't handle any more like the

1632.6 --> 1638.62
technobabble from Ken wheeler was going

1635.059 --> 1638.62
completely out of hand

1640.1 --> 1646.039
started out halfway decent and then it

1642.74 --> 1649.299
just rolled into just [ __ ]

1646.039 --> 1649.299
as it usually does

1652.64 --> 1656.14
All About The Ether

1656.419 --> 1661.8200000000002
and first it was like yeah either oh

1658.76 --> 1663.799
yeah it's a ancient element and electric

1661.82 --> 1665.4189999999999
ether there's something to it and it's

1663.799 --> 1667.8799999999999
like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then

1665.419 --> 1670.46
he started to subtly roll in the light

1667.88 --> 1672.5590000000002
medium [ __ ] and all that and just

1670.46 --> 1676.1000000000001
like oh my God

1672.559 --> 1677.6589999999999
and worse and worse and worse and worse

1676.1 --> 1681.6789999999999
and was like

1677.659 --> 1684.5590000000002
dude like this guy is bullshitting so

1681.679 --> 1685.46
bad he gives Bob no Dell a run for his

1684.559 --> 1688.279
money

1685.46 --> 1690.44
now of course Bob only really tries to

1688.279 --> 1692.6
do it like he does

1690.44 --> 1695.6200000000001
but it's just like at some point it just

1692.6 --> 1695.62
can't handle that anymore

1697.76 --> 1701.98
just too painful on the cognition

1714.74 --> 1719.72
first five seconds oh so you couldn't

1717.14 --> 1723.039
even get through the intro then that's

1719.72 --> 1723.039
just the intro

1725.059 --> 1730.72
that wasn't even any content

1727.64 --> 1730.72
that sailor

1738.679 --> 1743.0
are you the only one who thinks the

1740.84 --> 1745.4599999999998
black boot Tower issue makes sense from

1743.0 --> 1748.0
a curved perspective

1745.46 --> 1748.0
no

1748.1 --> 1753.8799999999999
or I should say yes yes you're the only

1751.58 --> 1753.8799999999999
one

1754.039 --> 1759.14
although that's that the only one right

1756.5 --> 1762.26
here in chat because it's really stupid

1759.14 --> 1764.24
because you're trying to reify

1762.26 --> 1767.419
The Horizon

1764.24 --> 1768.679
into being this edge of a sphere it's

1767.419 --> 1771.64
not

1768.679 --> 1771.64
Black Swan

1772.039 --> 1780.44
once you see

1774.98 --> 1784.1
a site that defies the geometry

1780.44 --> 1786.74
then it's over you understand

1784.1 --> 1791.0
The Horizon is not earth curve doesn't

1786.74 --> 1795.279
matter how it looks to you in a picture

1791.0 --> 1795.279
Black Swan it's not earth curve

1813.14 --> 1816.98
okay Dutch sailor fine well I didn't

1815.24 --> 1818.779
watch the video because it appealed to

1816.98 --> 1821.6200000000001
me I watched it because I wanted to know

1818.779 --> 1821.62
what they were up to

1821.899 --> 1828.9189999999999
it's like two very very dubious people

1826.76 --> 1833.299
teaming up

1828.919 --> 1835.46
in yeah in in a stream like that I just

1833.299 --> 1837.9189999999999
wanted to see like how far they would

1835.46 --> 1840.3990000000001
take it yeah they take it unbelievably

1837.919 --> 1840.3990000000001
VAR

1846.02 --> 1849.58
I mean like even

1849.74 --> 1855.32
like Santos is supposed to be a flat

1852.32 --> 1857.299
earther right not that I as a flat

1855.32 --> 1859.22
earther would like to associate with him

1857.299 --> 1861.519
at this point

1859.22 --> 1863.659
most people probably are a lot of people

1861.519 --> 1865.7
that even follow me won't even

1863.659 --> 1867.44
understand why well then you got a

1865.7 --> 1871.3400000000001
problem

1867.44 --> 1874.039
But Ken wheeler just

1871.34 --> 1875.9599999999998
started to talk about the electric ether

1874.039 --> 1879.98
then he started to reified with light

1875.96 --> 1884.48
and then suddenly he rolled on to

1879.98 --> 1886.46
like heliocentric presuppositional

1884.48 --> 1888.98
cosmology

1886.46 --> 1891.64
and Santos didn't even say anything

1888.98 --> 1891.64
about it

1891.74 --> 1898.7
like I wonder if he noticed

1895.1 --> 1902.98
or if he was too drunk on on what he was

1898.7 --> 1902.98
doing or something it was crazy

1907.46 --> 1911.179
but yeah to me it just seemed that that

1909.679 --> 1913.159
was also the point where I just couldn't

1911.179 --> 1916.519
handle it anymore it's just like

1913.159 --> 1920.1200000000001
like wow Santos why didn't you stop him

1916.519 --> 1924.26
are you worshiping this guy

1920.12 --> 1926.6
are you literally being like Oh yes yes

1924.26 --> 1929.72
it's okay I'm not going to interrupt you

1926.6 --> 1932.24
I don't want to downplay you even though

1929.72 --> 1934.22
you're obviously violating the most

1932.24 --> 1937.279
basic principles that I stand for

1934.22 --> 1939.019
supposedly as if flat earther right just

1937.279 --> 1943.059
dude

1939.019 --> 1943.059
it's all bad news

1944.0 --> 1947.14
these people

1951.2 --> 1956.0
right and maybe he did address it much

1953.659 --> 1958.48
later on but I didn't get past the 25

1956.0 --> 1958.48
minutes

1972.679 --> 1975.98
yeah

1973.7 --> 1979.279
so the Black Bull Tower can be explained

1975.98 --> 1981.019
by a Black Swan technicality

1979.279 --> 1984.5
no

1981.019 --> 1986.299
I wouldn't put it like that

1984.5 --> 1989.0
it's just that the Black Swan

1986.299 --> 1991.279
observations make any

1989.0 --> 1993.799
free supposition

1991.279 --> 1995.659
of the Horizon being the Leading Edge of

1993.799 --> 1999.1399999999999
a sphere you're looking at blocking

1995.659 --> 2001.659
things behind it completely pointless

1999.14 --> 2002.919
because it's not that geometry it cannot

2001.659 --> 2005.5590000000002
be

2002.919 --> 2007.24
or the Black Swan observations would not

2005.559 --> 2009.519
be possible

2007.24 --> 2013.179
at any point

2009.519 --> 2016.059
they are therefore you cannot continue

2013.179 --> 2018.88
to assume the horizon

2016.059 --> 2021.7
is curvature

2018.88 --> 2022.8990000000001
that's been undone that's not possible

2021.7 --> 2025.539
anymore

2022.899 --> 2028.059
that's the point of the Black Swan

2025.539 --> 2032.32
observations

2028.059 --> 2034.1789999999999
right you can still think that it is but

2032.32 --> 2036.899
you're just wrong

2034.179 --> 2036.8990000000001
hmm

2039.94 --> 2043.96
so how would you explain the

2041.38 --> 2046.24
observations in the photos well

2043.96 --> 2048.28
you see it

2046.24 --> 2051.639
it's there

2048.28 --> 2055.619
and then you make a photo of it

2051.639 --> 2055.619
yeah that's how you explain that

2065.639 --> 2073.179
yeah how you explain it is you're

2068.8 --> 2075.94
looking at the Earth the Earth is flat

2073.179 --> 2078.579
because we have Black Swan observations

2075.94 --> 2081.0
and yeah whatever you're seeing you're

2078.579 --> 2081.0
seeing

2081.22 --> 2088.72
as soon as you wander off in

2085.599 --> 2090.339
into thinking that maybe it looks like

2088.72 --> 2092.859
that because I'm standing on a boat

2090.339 --> 2096.04
you're just instantly wrong because

2092.859 --> 2099.52
there's Black Swan observations

2096.04 --> 2102.099
it cannot be a ball it cannot be looking

2099.52 --> 2103.599
like that because it's a ball

2102.099 --> 2106.0
you understand

2103.599 --> 2109.0
just Optics everything you see is just

2106.0 --> 2110.74
Optics and a Optics has a lot of weird

2109.0 --> 2112.54
side effects that geometry doesn't

2110.74 --> 2113.6189999999997
really know how to deal with

2112.54 --> 2115.9
right

2113.619 --> 2120.28
there's the weird

2115.9 --> 2123.28
bottom-up concealment effect

2120.28 --> 2125.8590000000004
right that even applies on confirmed

2123.28 --> 2127.6600000000003
measured flat surfaces right so that you

2125.859 --> 2129.94
cannot tie that in with some kind of

2127.66 --> 2132.2799999999997
geometric nature

2129.94 --> 2136.98
it just happens right this is Optics

2132.28 --> 2136.98
that happens right among other things

2140.619 --> 2146.32
so yeah when you see things yeah you

2143.8 --> 2149.7000000000003
might get a whole lot of ideas about why

2146.32 --> 2149.7000000000003
it looks the way it looks

2150.7 --> 2157.06
but as soon as you start to imagine that

2154.54 --> 2159.4
things might be concealed because

2157.06 --> 2161.5
they're behind Earth curve you're just

2159.4 --> 2163.359
wrong because there's been Black Swan

2161.5 --> 2166.119
observations

2163.359 --> 2167.44
which completely throw that notion out

2166.119 --> 2170.6400000000003
of the door

2167.44 --> 2170.64
into the trash

2181.26 --> 2186.099
clearly Googling perspective is not

2184.24 --> 2189.2799999999997
really going to help

2186.099 --> 2190.78
somebody that thinks that

2189.28 --> 2194.2200000000003
the way back cover

2190.78 --> 2194.2200000000003
comes that's not gonna help anything

2195.22 --> 2200.56
in general telling people just Google it

2198.04 --> 2202.359
is always a bad idea it never really

2200.56 --> 2204.66
helps the Ballers tried to do that too

2202.359 --> 2209.5
it never helps

2204.66 --> 2211.72
unless you in person can explain exactly

2209.5 --> 2214.78
what you want them to understand on the

2211.72 --> 2217.0
spot telling people to Google things is

2214.78 --> 2218.44
completely useless

2217.0 --> 2222.06
Google

2218.44 --> 2222.06
hands out results

2222.099 --> 2227.619
specifically fine-tuned to the person

2225.16 --> 2230.92
that is doing the searching

2227.619 --> 2233.2000000000003
so even if you get a very specific

2230.92 --> 2235.839
Google result when when searching

2233.2 --> 2238.18
something that's absolutely no guarantee

2235.839 --> 2241.119
that if you tell somebody else to do

2238.18 --> 2243.7599999999998
that that they have the same results you

2241.119 --> 2245.2000000000003
don't know what they might stumble onto

2243.76 --> 2248.82
right and there's a lot of

2245.2 --> 2248.8199999999997
misinformation out there as well

2249.099 --> 2253.42
so if you wanna

2251.079 --> 2254.98
teach somebody about perspective you're

2253.42 --> 2257.64
just gonna have to teach them about

2254.98 --> 2257.64
perspective

2271.0 --> 2275.859
right well that's fine no it doesn't

2273.64 --> 2279.16
seem to be trolling Clary

2275.859 --> 2281.44
but that that all depends though on how

2279.16 --> 2284.94
he's gonna take

2281.44 --> 2284.94
what I just told him

2313.06 --> 2320.56
yeah well that Karma just

2315.88 --> 2323.5
don't worry about them in chat

2320.56 --> 2325.92
worry about what I say right I addressed

2323.5 --> 2325.92
your questions

2327.339 --> 2333.46
yeah right so let's move on from you

2331.06 --> 2337.02
explaining how you're asking a question

2333.46 --> 2339.76
to me having answered it and then you

2337.02 --> 2340.96
acknowledging that I have and feeding

2339.76 --> 2343.48
back to me

2340.96 --> 2345.52
what you got out of it how about that

2343.48 --> 2347.44
how about stop getting distracted by

2345.52 --> 2350.94
other people in chat that aren't not

2347.44 --> 2350.94
getting involved in the conversation

2354.22 --> 2357.22
foreign

2374.859 --> 2377.94
what are you talking about

2390.88 --> 2394.6800000000003
there's no filters on my mic

2411.7 --> 2414.7
foreign

2423.06 --> 2430.199
game is very low though

2427.07 --> 2430.199
[Music]

2430.839 --> 2434.04
put it down a little

2440.2 --> 2444.72
when I get close okay fine

2471.46 --> 2477.9
all right so bad karma can you get back

2474.579 --> 2477.9
to what we're talking about

2493.26 --> 2499.119
okay well let's test it out then since

2497.2 --> 2501.46
the conversation is not really

2499.119 --> 2504.94
progressing

2501.46 --> 2507.16
let's turn it down further

2504.94 --> 2509.64
to a minimum you say well let's see if

2507.16 --> 2509.64
that works

2511.0 --> 2515.64
hmm

2512.859 --> 2515.64
okay

2515.68 --> 2519.52
well the sound goes a little lower like

2517.9 --> 2521.38
that

2519.52 --> 2523.9
so

2521.38 --> 2526.54
yeah but when I get close and I get loud

2523.9 --> 2529.6800000000003
it still doesn't go into the red I guess

2526.54 --> 2529.68
is this better

2533.14 --> 2540.16
let's do some sound checking

2536.68 --> 2542.7
so how is it at this distance can you

2540.16 --> 2542.7
still hear me

2543.28 --> 2548.1600000000003
or does it really sound like I'm in the

2545.56 --> 2548.16
distance now

2553.66 --> 2558.48
how's this

2555.52 --> 2558.48
still good

2562.119 --> 2566.5
okay

2563.8 --> 2570.48
no Rumble background noise

2566.5 --> 2570.48
is there a rumble in the background

2573.22 --> 2578.74
huh

2575.56 --> 2581.56
all right I'll try it like this you know

2578.74 --> 2584.339
thanks for paying attention Nathan I

2581.56 --> 2584.339
appreciate that

2586.3 --> 2592.0
right I'll I'll compare the sound

2589.9 --> 2593.02
with what it was like yesterday just to

2592.0 --> 2595.98
listening

2593.02 --> 2595.98
like what it's like

2596.26 --> 2599.8
we'll see

2597.46 --> 2602.94
I turned the gain off I just turned it

2599.8 --> 2602.94
all the way to one side

2604.42 --> 2610.44
birds in the background are clear really

2607.54 --> 2610.44
okay that's cool

2610.72 --> 2613.319
huh

2616.0 --> 2620.76
I don't even know why I had the gain on

2618.04 --> 2620.7599999999998
in the first place

2627.4 --> 2631.98
all right I'll keep it like this then

2629.38 --> 2631.98
forever

2637.3 --> 2642.52
I mean if the gain only causes things to

2640.42 --> 2644.92
sound rumbly and to cut out and all that

2642.52 --> 2647.46
then why would I have it

2644.92 --> 2647.46
hmm

2647.92 --> 2650.46
right

2675.94 --> 2682.7200000000003
okay so it's like for people that are

2679.3 --> 2684.28
like naturally shy

2682.72 --> 2687.819
or something

2684.28 --> 2690.96
yeah yeah I'm definitely loud

2687.819 --> 2690.96
whenever I can

2703.9 --> 2709.599
so yeah Nathan

2706.66 --> 2713.44
why were you not having a show somebody

2709.599 --> 2717.78
in chat said you were having like your

2713.44 --> 2717.78
windows done whatever that means

2743.56 --> 2748.74
why are you asking that to Nathan

2746.2 --> 2748.74
Moonshadow

2752.38 --> 2756.819
why can't we see lights

2756.88 --> 2760.079
at the horizon

2760.24 --> 2765.9399999999996
why do we see Celestial lights yeah why

2763.3 --> 2768.6400000000003
do we see them

2765.94 --> 2772.119
it's a big mystery how that works

2768.64 --> 2774.64
can't even pinpoint an original

2772.119 --> 2777.1600000000003
Source location for any of the lights so

2774.64 --> 2781.319
yeah how does that work why do we see it

2777.16 --> 2781.319
the way we do yeah that's a big mystery

2791.5 --> 2796.119
triple glass holy [ __ ]

2794.44 --> 2799.7200000000003
okay

2796.119 --> 2801.9
so serious isolation

2799.72 --> 2801.8999999999996
foreign

2844.78 --> 2847.5
foreign

2877.2 --> 2882.7
big into recycling

2879.88 --> 2885.1600000000003
and you mean information recycling

2882.7 --> 2887.98
right I don't know if they're big into

2885.16 --> 2891.5989999999997
recycling I'm big into recycling but not

2887.98 --> 2891.599
information recycling

2891.7 --> 2896.0789999999997
at some point when you recycle

2893.8 --> 2899.3390000000004
information the only proper way to bring

2896.079 --> 2899.3390000000004
it up is as a joke

2904.059 --> 2908.3390000000004
or as a historical reminder

2932.5 --> 2936.96
a little tiny one will get a grip

2951.099 --> 2955.6800000000003
all right yeah tiny Womble dude like

2955.96 --> 2961.119
that's [ __ ] man

2958.48 --> 2964.18
just don't go there

2961.119 --> 2966.52
like unless you can actually

2964.18 --> 2968.5589999999997
be specific don't

2966.52 --> 2970.92
don't talk to Nathan like that in my

2968.559 --> 2970.92
chat

2981.16 --> 2985.2999999999997
you are taking it oh so taking it too

2983.98 --> 2989.859
serious

2985.3 --> 2992.44
is being wrong louder is it

2989.859 --> 2994.48
so you don't want a discussion then that

2992.44 --> 2998.02
that's not really proof that he's wrong

2994.48 --> 3002.9
that's just proof that you're

2998.02 --> 3007.52
you want him to stop being right about

3002.9 --> 3007.52
you and your beliefs being wrong

3011.16 --> 3016.14
just just banter just talk you know

3013.319 --> 3018.3
don't don't remind us how our arguments

3016.14 --> 3020.64
make no freaking sense don't remind us

3018.3 --> 3023.28
how we double speak and contradict

3020.64 --> 3026.94
ourselves within the same sentence

3023.28 --> 3029.76
more and more periodically like

3026.94 --> 3032.46
growing in an exponential rate don't

3029.76 --> 3036.44
remind us about that

3032.46 --> 3036.44
we'll just say you're wrong

3045.54 --> 3052.099
why have you broke my Moon Shadow

3048.42 --> 3052.099
what the hell are you blabbering about

3057.96 --> 3064.76
say my name Moon Shadow

3060.18 --> 3064.7599999999998
say my name in chat you got a minute

3088.74 --> 3091.339
good

3092.059 --> 3098.46
stop being smart ass Clary

3095.94 --> 3100.44
no it's okay Moonshadow it's just that

3098.46 --> 3103.2
I'm addressing you

3100.44 --> 3105.119
and you seem to be constantly directing

3103.2 --> 3108.4399999999996
questions at Nathan Oakley so it's

3105.119 --> 3108.44
taking you for a heckler

3108.72 --> 3113.9399999999996
right now you're still listening to me

3111.359 --> 3116.0589999999997
that's good otherwise you'd be banned

3113.94 --> 3116.059
now

3124.44 --> 3128.7200000000003
right but it's it's kind of like what

3127.14 --> 3132.3799999999997
are you talking about

3128.72 --> 3132.3799999999997
blocking comments

3148.38 --> 3151.52
hey Andrew

3177.9 --> 3180.619
hmm

3205.14 --> 3210.7999999999997
about life and death

3207.359 --> 3210.7999999999997
what dead sailor

3212.64 --> 3216.2
well dude

3217.14 --> 3222.14
look tiny Wombles already very deep into

3219.839 --> 3222.14
it

3223.26 --> 3226.94
to you it is okay sure

3228.0 --> 3230.66
just

3230.88 --> 3233.7200000000003
ah

3239.339 --> 3245.0589999999997
that's good that you take it serious

3241.14 --> 3245.0589999999997
just don't get dramatic with it

3259.14 --> 3262.94
Integrity of your spirit yeah yeah

3268.319 --> 3271.859
all right Integrity of your spirit but

3270.48 --> 3274.98
also truth

3271.859 --> 3278.22
look the biggest truths ever are

3274.98 --> 3280.2
personal in the sense that the biggest

3278.22 --> 3282.359
truth to be discovered are the truths

3280.2 --> 3284.64
about yourself that are the most

3282.359 --> 3287.839
personally difficult to handle because

3284.64 --> 3287.839
it has to do with

3289.02 --> 3295.88
your inner obstacles

3292.079 --> 3295.88
right that's also truth

3297.72 --> 3301.2599999999998
now if you're avoiding your own inner

3300.24 --> 3304.7599999999998
truths

3301.26 --> 3308.2200000000003
to sit on a wider truth Pro truth when

3304.76 --> 3310.559
bandwagon then you're actually just

3308.22 --> 3312.66
exchanging

3310.559 --> 3314.8190000000004
one mistake for another

3312.66 --> 3316.92
because then you're using something that

3314.819 --> 3318.9
is good as an escape

3316.92 --> 3322.2000000000003
and that's the point

3318.9 --> 3325.2000000000003
the truth is all about not escaping but

3322.2 --> 3328.819
finding that way through

3325.2 --> 3328.819
and not avoiding the challenge

3339.9 --> 3344.04
the challenge of overcoming your own

3341.94 --> 3345.299
obstacles right and that doesn't mean oh

3344.04 --> 3349.02
surrender

3345.299 --> 3351.18
do something that you think is scary

3349.02 --> 3352.799
just because you think it's scary and

3351.18 --> 3354.54
you don't wanna

3352.799 --> 3358.46
be stopped by something you think is

3354.54 --> 3358.46
scary now that would be oversimplifying

3360.66 --> 3365.48
it has to make sense

3363.299 --> 3365.48
foreign

3367.04 --> 3372.48
and that's a big part of it it's not

3369.78 --> 3375.119
engaging in things that don't make

3372.48 --> 3377.04
logical sense and the realization that

3375.119 --> 3379.38
there are things out there

3377.04 --> 3381.54
that seem to make sense on the surface

3379.38 --> 3384.48
but in reality when you look deeper into

3381.54 --> 3386.7599999999998
it they don't and you can pinpoint in

3384.48 --> 3390.92
how they don't make sense

3386.76 --> 3390.92
if you take your time to do that

3419.54 --> 3425.66
yeah but that's not technically how that

3423.24 --> 3425.66
works

3428.22 --> 3436.3799999999997
being wrong is not a sin

3432.42 --> 3438.1800000000003
being wrong and then knowing that

3436.38 --> 3442.02
knowing

3438.18 --> 3444.66
how it is wrong and then still saying it

3442.02 --> 3446.46
that's a lie

3444.66 --> 3448.319
if you go with something that you don't

3446.46 --> 3451.02
have full oversight with and you just

3448.319 --> 3453.54
trust certain factors that's not

3451.02 --> 3456.44
necessarily a sin the sin comes in when

3453.54 --> 3456.44
you ignore

3457.079 --> 3462.42
the errors as you are confronted with

3460.38 --> 3466.38
them that's where sin comes in that's

3462.42 --> 3468.54
where ignorance like ignorance is a sin

3466.38 --> 3472.2200000000003
because it's an action

3468.54 --> 3475.2599999999998
right being uninformed is not a sin

3472.22 --> 3477.66
ignorance is a sin

3475.26 --> 3481.2000000000003
when you learn something and then you

3477.66 --> 3484.14
ignore it and you forget about it again

3481.2 --> 3485.46
that is a sin and that is a sin with

3484.14 --> 3488.339
palpable

3485.46 --> 3489.9
logical consequences because if you

3488.339 --> 3492.24
ignore things

3489.9 --> 3493.559
then you cannot properly prepare

3492.24 --> 3496.5789999999997
yourself

3493.559 --> 3496.579
against it

3502.799 --> 3510.42
and that ignorance will be a blank slate

3507.059 --> 3513.599
power over you that others that know

3510.42 --> 3517.4
that and can deal with that can use that

3513.599 --> 3521.9
blank slate of you against you

3517.4 --> 3521.9
controlling you through your ignorance

3522.96 --> 3529.26
and that action is a sin

3525.619 --> 3532.5
depending on the spirit that guides that

3529.26 --> 3534.599
that action could be a sin could be for

3532.5 --> 3537.18
Pure control to destroy to squeeze the

3534.599 --> 3539.88
money out of it that's a sin or you

3537.18 --> 3543.18
could use somebody's belief to set them

3539.88 --> 3545.099
on a better path and then it's not a sin

3543.18 --> 3546.7799999999997
and that makes it really complicated

3545.099 --> 3549.2000000000003
right it's all about the intention

3546.78 --> 3549.2000000000003
really

3556.92 --> 3563.52
right and even believing something silly

3561.299 --> 3566.04
is not bad

3563.52 --> 3569.4
it's not a sin

3566.04 --> 3571.74
it's when you let that silly believe

3569.4 --> 3573.7200000000003
make you ignore things that you

3571.74 --> 3578.4599999999996
shouldn't

3573.72 --> 3582.4199999999996
if it leads you to act with negligence

3578.46 --> 3585.14
then that negligence is the sin right so

3582.42 --> 3585.14
ignorance

3586.5 --> 3593.52
and even just believing silly things is

3590.7 --> 3596.0989999999997
not a sin on its own but it is it opens

3593.52 --> 3598.16
up the door

3596.099 --> 3601.8590000000004
right the more lies the more

3598.16 --> 3603.839
incorrectness you allow to root itself

3601.859 --> 3607.74
in your spirit

3603.839 --> 3610.68
the more the doors of Seduction and evil

3607.74 --> 3613.22
scheming open up to you to try and mess

3610.68 --> 3613.22
with that

3613.92 --> 3621.2400000000002
right the more sin you take with you

3618.0 --> 3622.559
the more that sin will be used against

3621.24 --> 3625.0789999999997
you

3622.559 --> 3629.0
this is all very esoteric

3625.079 --> 3629.0
it's also very true

3635.64 --> 3638.699
[Music]

3647.22 --> 3653.24
yes we do tiny Wombo it's called The

3649.38 --> 3657.559
Black Swan observation yeah observing

3653.24 --> 3657.5589999999997
light based measurements

3657.66 --> 3663.299
extremely low observation height very

3659.819 --> 3665.099
far distance sight Black Swan that's a

3663.299 --> 3669.02
measurement that's a measurement that

3665.099 --> 3669.02
proves the Earth is not a globe

3669.059 --> 3673.619
there's your measurement measured

3670.92 --> 3676.92
measured flat measured not to be a globe

3673.619 --> 3681.299
yeah measured it's measured measured

3676.92 --> 3684.14
through pictures measured through Optics

3681.299 --> 3684.14
measured

3686.339 --> 3693.54
yeah not not a liar just chanting he's

3690.48 --> 3695.96
chanting you can't get out of it Boomer

3693.54 --> 3695.96
syndrome

3702.48 --> 3706.32
[Music]

3714.98 --> 3718.98
can't have picked just from space tiny

3717.66 --> 3722.359
Womble that's the second law of

3718.98 --> 3722.359
Thermodynamics violation

3722.46 --> 3727.559
you don't have pictures of space nobody

3724.98 --> 3731.039
has pictures from space they must be

3727.559 --> 3734.039
fabricated must be they cannot be as it

3731.039 --> 3736.7990000000004
is that's a physical impossibility

3734.039 --> 3739.8590000000004
she can't have gas pressure next to a

3736.799 --> 3744.2599999999998
vacuum of outer space that's the second

3739.859 --> 3744.2599999999998
law of thermodynamic Dynamics violation

3745.98 --> 3749.359
no it's not not that's

3749.819 --> 3755.96
okay that's not even chanting that's

3751.92 --> 3755.96
just a tantrum now a tiny Womble

3764.039 --> 3768.119
it's

3765.539 --> 3770.599
2 p.m Amsterdam time over here that

3768.119 --> 3770.599
platform

3785.839 --> 3792.66
hey clutch bear

3788.819 --> 3796.22
dude you missed yesterday's show

3792.66 --> 3796.22
did you see my title card

3836.64 --> 3844.319
so where is the container

3838.799 --> 3847.5
well we have really thin air up there

3844.319 --> 3850.02
and thicker and air down here because we

3847.5 --> 3852.48
have a container tiny Womble

3850.02 --> 3855.119
if we didn't have a container

3852.48 --> 3858.48
that couldn't be you can't have a

3855.119 --> 3860.2200000000003
gradient without containment yeah you

3858.48 --> 3863.119
can't have gas pressure gradients

3860.22 --> 3863.1189999999997
without containment

3866.7 --> 3872.9399999999996
do you understand

3869.099 --> 3875.46
you cannot do it right I'm really really

3872.94 --> 3878.88
tired of you now by the way you've

3875.46 --> 3884.119
supposedly followed my show for years

3878.88 --> 3886.1400000000003
and yet you risk still respond like Mark

3884.119 --> 3888.92
oh God

3886.14 --> 3888.92
not mark

3889.94 --> 3895.44
yeah like Mark Taylor

3892.74 --> 3897.4199999999996
you're responding like Mark Taylor now

3895.44 --> 3901.079
to these questions

3897.42 --> 3903.48
that you've been exposed to for years

3901.079 --> 3906.0
and you're still responding with Mark

3903.48 --> 3909.539
Taylor level questions

3906.0 --> 3913.2
I find that Beyond disappointing I find

3909.539 --> 3915.2990000000004
that a little intolerable actually

3913.2 --> 3917.46
yeah you don't know yeah you don't know

3915.299 --> 3919.74
that that's fine you don't know who Mark

3917.46 --> 3922.559
Taylor is good you don't need to know

3919.74 --> 3926.0
and what you do need to know however is

3922.559 --> 3926.0
this is intolerable

3926.16 --> 3934.22
that you still ask these questions is

3928.74 --> 3934.22
intolerable borderline demented okay

3974.72 --> 3981.8999999999996
Neil degrass has debunked virgin's page

3978.66 --> 3985.859
but everybody debunked it

3981.9 --> 3988.26
like come on even Joe ditto Rogan

3985.859 --> 3992.24
debunked that he went to space right so

3988.26 --> 3992.2400000000002
if even the toe goes after it

3992.7 --> 3997.7599999999998
yeah then literally everybody in the

3995.579 --> 3997.76
world

3998.099 --> 4001.2200000000003
everybody in the world could have done

4000.14 --> 4004.1189999999997
that

4001.22 --> 4004.1189999999997
dispelled that

4013.94 --> 4018.799
they have never been up in space well

4016.76 --> 4022.2400000000002
nobody's ever been up in space because

4018.799 --> 4022.24
that region doesn't exist

4023.539 --> 4029.48
it's just the part of the contained

4027.079 --> 4032.119
volume of the realm

4029.48 --> 4036.28
that has lower gas pressure

4032.119 --> 4036.28
that's what that is it's not space

4036.44 --> 4042.02
the only way it is space is yeah it's

4039.079 --> 4045.1400000000003
volume volume just volume

4042.02 --> 4047.38
a limited volume a limited amount of

4045.14 --> 4047.3799999999997
volume

4047.42 --> 4054.02
that allows the gas pressure to manifest

4050.799 --> 4055.7
pressuring against every part of the

4054.02 --> 4058.52
container whatever it is like whatever

4055.7 --> 4062.1189999999997
its shape is like it's pressing against

4058.52 --> 4064.94
every part of the container allowing the

4062.119 --> 4068.6600000000003
gas pressure to manifest

4064.94 --> 4071.18
and then the secondary influences very

4068.66 --> 4072.64
like most likely primarily temperature

4071.18 --> 4076.0389999999998
related

4072.64 --> 4078.5589999999997
influencing how that gas pressure is

4076.039 --> 4081.92
divided within the container it is

4078.559 --> 4085.1800000000003
pressing against every part of the walls

4081.92 --> 4085.1800000000003
into a gradient

4128.839 --> 4135.46
yeah Roger The Cabin Boy uh say my name

4132.44 --> 4135.46
you got 30 seconds

4145.88 --> 4149.900000000001
okay

4147.92 --> 4152.7390000000005
I might just ban you anyway because

4149.9 --> 4152.739
you're nagging

4152.839 --> 4157.299
seeking star water I don't appreciate

4155.0 --> 4157.299
that

4176.48 --> 4180.259999999999
don't know what that means Mastery

4178.759 --> 4183.35
whatever

4180.26 --> 4183.35
[Music]

4193.239 --> 4199.299999999999
hey that flat fellow thanks for the 99

4195.86 --> 4199.299999999999
cent Super Chat donation

4241.64 --> 4246.9400000000005
why does water accumulate on surfaces

4244.52 --> 4246.9400000000005
like do

4247.34 --> 4250.12
because

4250.3 --> 4257.719
it moves to lower grounds because the

4254.84 --> 4261.159000000001
water vapor on average is denser

4257.719 --> 4261.159
than the regular air

4261.38 --> 4266.96
and then yeah if it actually hits the

4264.32 --> 4269.0599999999995
ground and that ground is of a

4266.96 --> 4272.08
lower temperature

4269.06 --> 4274.76
that literally triggers it to start

4272.08 --> 4277.54
condensating and that's how do then

4274.76 --> 4277.54
comes into being

4278.48 --> 4284.0599999999995
because of the temperature difference

4281.84 --> 4285.62
that's also why students the sun really

4284.06 --> 4287.3
comes up

4285.62 --> 4290.0599999999995
clearly

4287.3 --> 4291.679
then yeah that do evaporates very

4290.06 --> 4294.4400000000005
quickly

4291.679 --> 4297.1
or gets reabsorbed

4294.44 --> 4297.099999999999
plants

4312.38 --> 4316.659000000001
okay that flat fellow uh

4316.94 --> 4323.599999999999
well look I appreciate your

4321.199 --> 4326.0599999999995
your nickels that you drop in my chat

4323.6 --> 4328.219
every now and then I do if you really

4326.06 --> 4331.400000000001
want to support me though actually

4328.219 --> 4333.86
support me financially then using PayPal

4331.4 --> 4336.98
would be a much better solution because

4333.86 --> 4339.259999999999
I actually received that money

4336.98 --> 4340.459999999999
everything that's dropped in the super

4339.26 --> 4345.679
chats

4340.46 --> 4349.179
usually yeah there I might get like

4345.679 --> 4349.179
one percent out of it

4350.659 --> 4354.099999999999
so just so you know

4354.38 --> 4359.0
but hey the super chats are still fun

4357.02 --> 4360.8
for like advertisement

4359.0 --> 4363.14
just to say hello just to stand out

4360.8 --> 4364.52
right I have no problem with it it's

4363.14 --> 4366.56
just that if you actually want to

4364.52 --> 4368.42
financially support me please choose

4366.56 --> 4371.360000000001
PayPal

4368.42 --> 4373.719
I actually get all of it and I get it

4371.36 --> 4373.719
quickly

4374.54 --> 4377.0199999999995
anyway

4397.64 --> 4403.84
as

4399.739 --> 4403.839999999999
yeah Kristen I agreed

4412.219 --> 4417.699
I don't know why I even brought that up

4414.38 --> 4417.6990000000005
like what do you think

4417.86 --> 4423.679
like how does this any of this relate to

4420.56 --> 4425.54
the necessity of a container to in order

4423.679 --> 4427.64
to have gas pressure and gas pressure

4425.54 --> 4430.1
gradients

4427.64 --> 4433.46
and even the

4430.1 --> 4435.26
water transition phases right you

4433.46 --> 4438.92
require pressure to have water

4435.26 --> 4440.360000000001
transition phases right from Ice to

4438.92 --> 4443.36
water

4440.36 --> 4447.0199999999995
to water vapor yeah that requires

4443.36 --> 4449.659
pressurized containment as well yeah you

4447.02 --> 4451.040000000001
can have any of that without a container

4449.659 --> 4453.58
as well

4451.04 --> 4453.58
you understand

4454.04 --> 4457.239
it will all go away

4462.62 --> 4467.0599999999995
like

4463.82 --> 4471.5
if you have no containment if you don't

4467.06 --> 4473.4800000000005
have any pre a stable gas pressure you

4471.5 --> 4476.0
could emulate such a situation with the

4473.48 --> 4478.639999999999
vacuum chamber which is an unnatural

4476.0 --> 4480.86
scenario it emulates what it's like to

4478.64 --> 4483.38
not have a not have gas pressure

4480.86 --> 4485.96
containment

4483.38 --> 4488.2390000000005
water just evaporates you don't even

4485.96 --> 4491.36
have to heat it it just starts to

4488.239 --> 4492.86
evaporate it starts boiling turning into

4491.36 --> 4497.0199999999995
water vapor

4492.86 --> 4497.0199999999995
because of the low pressure yeah

4497.06 --> 4503.900000000001
that's because we have water

4500.84 --> 4505.159000000001
and ice and water vapor because there is

4503.9 --> 4507.44
containment

4505.159 --> 4509.659
right it all like nothing happens

4507.44 --> 4513.32
without containment

4509.659 --> 4515.839999999999
nothing can exist in a stable fashion no

4513.32 --> 4518.239
life conditions could happen without

4515.84 --> 4520.58
containment

4518.239 --> 4523.159
a Life Starts

4520.58 --> 4525.739
with containment

4523.159 --> 4529.04
no containment no Realm

4525.739 --> 4532.218999999999
no Earth no life cycle nothing nothing

4529.04 --> 4534.4
would exist without that containment

4532.219 --> 4534.4
foreign

4564.76 --> 4568.06
good to see you

4570.62 --> 4573.699
and Michael Khan

4576.92 --> 4580.3
didn't see you there earlier

4584.96 --> 4590.3
so yeah Roger The Cabin Boy since you

4587.78 --> 4592.54
were on seeking star water's ass with

4590.3 --> 4592.54
that

4592.82 --> 4598.639999999999
I actually addressed the entire scenario

4595.52 --> 4600.5
that you were engaging seeking star

4598.64 --> 4603.4400000000005
water about

4600.5 --> 4604.82
involved every part of what you were

4603.44 --> 4607.28
questioning

4604.82 --> 4609.44
in the explanation so why don't you

4607.28 --> 4613.48
address me now

4609.44 --> 4613.48
or did you just go away again

4639.92 --> 4645.26
that's fine

4642.5 --> 4646.58
I addressed what you were talking about

4645.26 --> 4648.5
though so

4646.58 --> 4651.88
how about you

4648.5 --> 4651.88
start talking to me

4652.94 --> 4657.32
no don't go there so you can start what

4655.34 --> 4659.3
it just don't do that

4657.32 --> 4662.139999999999
just don't

4659.3 --> 4662.14
need

4675.739 --> 4680.5599999999995
you're fine with that so go

4685.46 --> 4691.82
how about that container eh how about

4687.86 --> 4694.339999999999
everything being able to be stable and

4691.82 --> 4699.32
having water cycles and all that because

4694.34 --> 4699.32
there is a limited volume containment

4700.159 --> 4704.139999999999
how about a some recognition there

4722.48 --> 4729.259999999999
oh my God oh

4725.12 --> 4731.42
so you didn't listen at all did you you

4729.26 --> 4733.88
didn't listen to a word I said even

4731.42 --> 4735.02
though I spent five minutes explaining

4733.88 --> 4739.4800000000005
it

4735.02 --> 4739.4800000000005
you didn't listen to a word I said

4739.699 --> 4744.86
and I must have overall taken every part

4743.3 --> 4747.26
of the data

4744.86 --> 4751.5199999999995
and repeated it about three times and

4747.26 --> 4755.320000000001
you didn't listen to a word I said did

4751.52 --> 4755.320000000001
you Roger The Cabin Boy

4761.179 --> 4764.86
okay AGM that's fine

4766.699 --> 4769.9
yeah that's right

4770.12 --> 4777.26
necessary antecedent for Life water

4773.54 --> 4778.159
cycle gas pressure any gradients of any

4777.26 --> 4780.9800000000005
sort

4778.159 --> 4783.92
all of that yeah without containment

4780.98 --> 4786.639999999999
without a limitation to the amount of

4783.92 --> 4786.64
volume available

4786.98 --> 4792.08
yeah you can't have any of that that's

4789.8 --> 4795.08
right that's what I said

4792.08 --> 4798.0199999999995
so I don't see how you could have come

4795.08 --> 4800.36
to the conclusion we have a measurable

4798.02 --> 4801.92
gradient we have no evidence for a

4800.36 --> 4805.099999999999
container

4801.92 --> 4807.86
right so that's immediately denying the

4805.1 --> 4810.26
antecedent relationship

4807.86 --> 4812.36
we have gas pressure we have a gas

4810.26 --> 4814.6
pressure gradient we have a water cycle

4812.36 --> 4817.28
we have life

4814.6 --> 4820.639
one can only

4817.28 --> 4822.679
no exception can only conclude there

4820.639 --> 4825.38
must be containment because there's

4822.679 --> 4827.36
evidence for all these things that have

4825.38 --> 4831.6990000000005
containment as an antecedent

4827.36 --> 4833.38
relationship it's ingrained within the

4831.699 --> 4836.919999999999
foundations

4833.38 --> 4836.92
of physics

4844.78 --> 4850.58
it's called the second law of

4846.739 --> 4853.099999999999
Thermodynamics yeah thermodynamics

4850.58 --> 4855.94
the basics the basics of how things work

4853.1 --> 4855.9400000000005
entropy

4855.98 --> 4860.739
Etc

4857.42 --> 4860.7390000000005
pressure Dynamics

4862.46 --> 4868.659
basic physics yeah

4866.06 --> 4871.04
not a physical container

4868.659 --> 4872.839999999999
can you give me an example of another

4871.04 --> 4875.3
type of container

4872.84 --> 4878.02
what is this non-physical container you

4875.3 --> 4878.02
are speaking of

4880.58 --> 4885.38
I mean unless you're going to theorize

4883.1 --> 4887.9800000000005
out like I have that there might be a

4885.38 --> 4891.26
looping factor and then yeah the volume

4887.98 --> 4893.718999999999
is limited through the loop

4891.26 --> 4895.280000000001
it's still contained though it still has

4893.719 --> 4898.36
walls

4895.28 --> 4898.36
to press upon

4908.48 --> 4914.678999999999
gravity hold really how how does gravity

4912.199 --> 4914.678999999999
do that

4916.04 --> 4921.8
and go bear to the elk yes just what is

4919.34 --> 4924.08
up with these names

4921.8 --> 4926.3
this is just the stupid trolls again

4924.08 --> 4930.639
isn't it it's just the same bunch of

4926.3 --> 4930.639
wacky losers over and over again

4944.36 --> 4949.5199999999995
second law of Thermodynamics we equally

4947.6 --> 4952.6990000000005
just no that's not what that means at

4949.52 --> 4955.400000000001
all second law of Thermodynamics tells

4952.699 --> 4957.199
you that if you want to have

4955.4 --> 4961.94
gas pressure

4957.199 --> 4966.099999999999
there has to be walls to cause the gas

4961.94 --> 4966.099999999999
pressure walls on all side

4967.46 --> 4972.08
yeah

4968.54 --> 4974.659
the available volume the walls

4972.08 --> 4978.46
they allow the gas pressure to manifest

4974.659 --> 4978.46
all gas pressure really is

4978.739 --> 4984.32
any form of gas pressure is literally

4981.56 --> 4987.1990000000005
directly pushing on all the walls

4984.32 --> 4989.299999999999
all of it and that is how the gas

4987.199 --> 4992.12
presses against the walls then against

4989.3 --> 4993.860000000001
itself and that allows the gas pressure

4992.12 --> 4996.739
to be everywhere it's because it's

4993.86 --> 4999.739
pressing on all the walls right

4996.739 --> 5004.0599999999995
now I don't know about any non-physical

4999.739 --> 5006.4
walls that could achieve such an effect

5004.06 --> 5010.4800000000005
I don't know if you've known about one

5006.4 --> 5012.759999999999
of those but this gravity you say

5010.48 --> 5015.699
how does it do that

5012.76 --> 5020.26
how does gravity form a wall

5015.699 --> 5022.78
you realize what a wall is right

5020.26 --> 5026.1990000000005
how does that work

5022.78 --> 5027.28
and as far as I know gravity is not a

5026.199 --> 5030.4
force

5027.28 --> 5032.5
right because you could calculate wall

5030.4 --> 5033.219
and gas pressure with forces and all

5032.5 --> 5035.62
that

5033.219 --> 5038.26
yeah well gravity is not really a force

5035.62 --> 5039.699
so how is it supposed to do that I was a

5038.26 --> 5042.88
non-force

5039.699 --> 5045.879999999999
supposed to be

5042.88 --> 5045.88
effectively

5045.94 --> 5051.339999999999
work like a container wall how does that

5049.42 --> 5053.5
work

5051.34 --> 5055.54
I don't think it does I think that only

5053.5 --> 5058.56
works in your mind if you don't think

5055.54 --> 5058.56
about it for too long

5065.32 --> 5069.219
well you see a pressure gradient

5067.12 --> 5072.28
something is causing it what's the cause

5069.219 --> 5075.36
temperature differential

5072.28 --> 5079.48
you hearing me temperature

5075.36 --> 5082.9
differential different temperatures can

5079.48 --> 5085.48
prove definitely the gradient it's it's

5082.9 --> 5088.36
absolutely you can simulate it you can

5085.48 --> 5093.759999999999
take a separated container with gas in

5088.36 --> 5095.799999999999
it apply cold on one side apply heat on

5093.76 --> 5097.900000000001
the other side doesn't even matter how

5095.8 --> 5099.88
the whole thing is oriented you can do

5097.9 --> 5103.12
it from side to side you don't even have

5099.88 --> 5104.86
to do it top down from yeah from bottom

5103.12 --> 5108.48
to up

5104.86 --> 5112.179
there will form a gradient

5108.48 --> 5115.239
within that local container gas

5112.179 --> 5117.159
yeah within that contained gas a

5115.239 --> 5119.739
gradient will form if there is a temp

5117.159 --> 5122.379999999999
temperature differential at either sides

5119.739 --> 5126.638999999999
that is my X I'm just going to make that

5122.38 --> 5128.9800000000005
claim claim claim claim the gradient in

5126.639 --> 5132.159000000001
the realm is caused by temperature

5128.98 --> 5135.58
differential that's my claim I make that

5132.159 --> 5137.92
claim I claim it temperature causes the

5135.58 --> 5142.9
gradient temperature causes the gradient

5137.92 --> 5145.8
temperature causes the gradient

5142.9 --> 5145.799999999999
you got it

5168.94 --> 5173.4
yeah it's time to start weed whacking

5184.659 --> 5188.679
ah George Sanford I think you're

5186.699 --> 5190.96
overestimating it

5188.679 --> 5193.4800000000005
even the ones that made up the term

5190.96 --> 5196.6
don't know what it is nobody knows what

5193.48 --> 5200.739
it is even the ones that made it up

5196.6 --> 5202.120000000001
you see gravity is an ongoing process of

5200.739 --> 5207.58
discovery

5202.12 --> 5210.94
on what could possibly exist to justify

5207.58 --> 5214.3
the heliocentric model to be as it is

5210.94 --> 5216.879999999999
it's an Ever ongoing Quest

5214.3 --> 5219.639
to find the MacGuffin that makes it all

5216.88 --> 5222.1
possible and since it has to be all

5219.639 --> 5224.8
possible it has to be assumed that it is

5222.1 --> 5226.780000000001
exactly the way the eurocentric model is

5224.8 --> 5231.1
that means that you can never stop

5226.78 --> 5233.5
looking for Gravity to find out what it

5231.1 --> 5236.1990000000005
is in order to make it all possible the

5233.5 --> 5238.54
way you assume it is

5236.199 --> 5240.719
does it sound convoluted at all now does

5238.54 --> 5240.719
it

5254.44 --> 5260.5
right yeah made up term

5257.679 --> 5262.9
but it's a description of an uh an

5260.5 --> 5266.139
effect ironically enough not a force

5262.9 --> 5269.08
it's an effect officially now yeah

5266.139 --> 5271.900000000001
it can't push on things it can't do

5269.08 --> 5273.5199999999995
anything it cannot have any influence on

5271.9 --> 5277.42
anything

5273.52 --> 5280.120000000001
it's purely conceptual at this time

5277.42 --> 5282.1
and that's not very handy yeah you can't

5280.12 --> 5284.08
get any closer to discovering what

5282.1 --> 5286.06
gravity is if it doesn't influence

5284.08 --> 5287.5
anything because it's just a secondary

5286.06 --> 5289.179
effect

5287.5 --> 5292.3
that you can

5289.179 --> 5295.3
actually measure or sense in any way in

5292.3 --> 5298.12
the physical 3D Realm

5295.3 --> 5300.400000000001
so people just keep on looking for what

5298.12 --> 5304.0
gravity is oh look we found a gravity

5300.4 --> 5306.36
wave oh we found the gravity particle oh

5304.0 --> 5309.52
we found gravitons

5306.36 --> 5312.4
interacting with another dimension oh

5309.52 --> 5315.040000000001
look at all this gravity things that

5312.4 --> 5318.239
they're discovering and none of it has

5315.04 --> 5322.3
to do with anything it's pure

5318.239 --> 5326.04
technobabble [ __ ] every part of it

5322.3 --> 5326.04
techno Babble [ __ ]

5357.639 --> 5362.679
that's just a blank assertion Robin The

5360.94 --> 5364.96
Cabin Boy

5362.679 --> 5366.639
already said yeah you can definitely

5364.96 --> 5368.7390000000005
emulate

5366.639 --> 5370.32
gas pressure in a separated container

5368.739 --> 5372.638999999999
then apply different temperature

5370.32 --> 5374.199
influences and then notice the gradient

5372.639 --> 5376.78
forms

5374.199 --> 5378.82
it's good enough for me that means oh

5376.78 --> 5381.4
yeah look at that temperature influence

5378.82 --> 5382.42
it causes a gradient palpably right

5381.4 --> 5385.0599999999995
there

5382.42 --> 5386.4400000000005
where no gradient was before now there

5385.06 --> 5388.2390000000005
is a gradient because of the temperature

5386.44 --> 5389.32
influence well there you go you got a

5388.239 --> 5392.44
gradient

5389.32 --> 5395.5
oh you want to do that on world scale

5392.44 --> 5398.62
well good luck with that

5395.5 --> 5402.1
I don't know how to introduce heat and

5398.62 --> 5403.78
cold elements outside of containment in

5402.1 --> 5405.88
order to influence what is in the

5403.78 --> 5409.42
container yeah I don't know how to do

5405.88 --> 5412.12
that I do know however is there is a

5409.42 --> 5413.679
temperature difference

5412.12 --> 5415.84
at the ground

5413.679 --> 5419.26
it's warmer

5415.84 --> 5423.34
the higher up you go it's colder oh it's

5419.26 --> 5426.1
not all perfectly linear whatever

5423.34 --> 5428.8
oh that some pointers it gets a little

5426.1 --> 5431.4400000000005
hotter and then it gets colder again

5428.8 --> 5435.52
whatever man I don't know why I just

5431.44 --> 5438.699
know it's hottest at ground level it's

5435.52 --> 5441.9400000000005
coldest at the top that we can't really

5438.699 --> 5443.86
reach but it just seems to get colder

5441.94 --> 5445.659
so yeah we know there is a temperature

5443.86 --> 5448.0599999999995
influence

5445.659 --> 5450.759999999999
and I'm pretty sure that when we create

5448.06 --> 5452.1990000000005
a temperature influence within a

5450.76 --> 5455.139
container

5452.199 --> 5456.94
it causes a gas pressure gradient

5455.139 --> 5461.58
so there you go

5456.94 --> 5461.58
that's the only clue really

5461.86 --> 5467.5
but it is a good clue it's actually a

5464.679 --> 5471.34
palpable clue

5467.5 --> 5474.78
what causes the gradient temperature

5471.34 --> 5474.78
you can do that yourself

5474.88 --> 5478.92
in a small simulation setup

5479.139 --> 5485.38
no it doesn't match what you want

5481.54 --> 5488.0199999999995
everything to be perfectly linear like a

5485.38 --> 5489.34
super reduced math formula well good

5488.02 --> 5491.9800000000005
luck with that

5489.34 --> 5494.08
I don't know all the influences of what

5491.98 --> 5496.659
is actually transpiring in this realm I

5494.08 --> 5499.3
just know it's hotter at the ground and

5496.659 --> 5502.299999999999
it's colder up there and oh look at that

5499.3 --> 5505.6
pressure is higher down here

5502.3 --> 5508.679
and lower up there yeah well

5505.6 --> 5508.679
what more do you need

5510.159 --> 5517.379999999999
is my chat stuck what's going on

5513.1 --> 5517.38
whoa yeah my chat is stuck that's weird

5517.6 --> 5522.659000000001
in Google not in the in the show

5526.78 --> 5529.5
hmm

5531.82 --> 5535.98
it's been stuck for a few minutes

5546.52 --> 5551.400000000001
damn it there's like five freaking

5549.1 --> 5551.400000000001
minutes

5576.639 --> 5583.42
in reality no no it's not that's just a

5580.9 --> 5585.699
blank assertion in reality it's not

5583.42 --> 5587.7390000000005
really possible except I don't have an

5585.699 --> 5589.36
example of that I'm just asserting that

5587.739 --> 5590.919999999999
in reality it's not possible even though

5589.36 --> 5593.32
I gave an example

5590.92 --> 5597.639
on a small scale you can do that and it

5593.32 --> 5600.78
is possible so you're just at this point

5597.639 --> 5603.82
you're maneuvering towards tactical

5600.78 --> 5605.8
lying I'd like to warn you about that

5603.82 --> 5609.04
Roger The Cabin Boy

5605.8 --> 5611.26
you're now maneuvering into tactical lie

5609.04 --> 5612.34
territory I wouldn't go there if I were

5611.26 --> 5614.9400000000005
you

5612.34 --> 5617.62
I I know how to pick up on that

5614.94 --> 5619.719
instantly as soon as I read it which has

5617.62 --> 5622.139
taken me five minutes because my chat

5619.719 --> 5622.139
was stuck

5622.3 --> 5625.7390000000005
what's your lie

5626.199 --> 5632.799999999999
but in measured reality the temperature

5629.679 --> 5634.36
and pressure gradients are at arch with

5632.8 --> 5638.9400000000005
each other

5634.36 --> 5638.94
total made up horseshit

5650.139 --> 5653.82
you have no example of that

5654.219 --> 5660.1
it's not true

5656.86 --> 5662.44
they are you contested I oh yeah no no

5660.1 --> 5664.4800000000005
they're not

5662.44 --> 5666.5199999999995
you're just saying that it's not

5664.48 --> 5668.44
possible even though it still is there

5666.52 --> 5670.179
it's still yeah the higher up you go

5668.44 --> 5671.199
lower pressure the high the lower the

5670.179 --> 5672.9400000000005
temperature

5671.199 --> 5675.099999999999
lower down you go yeah higher

5672.94 --> 5678.339999999999
temperature higher pressure yeah I'm

5675.1 --> 5681.46
sorry I'm sorry that you think in your

5678.34 --> 5682.659000000001
mind when dislocating your reason from

5681.46 --> 5684.88
reality

5682.659 --> 5688.5
that it doesn't really work out except

5684.88 --> 5688.5
it does work out

5688.96 --> 5692.699
you're just lying

5695.32 --> 5701.739
yeah I know I know that exists I already

5698.44 --> 5704.199
addressed that Roger I already addressed

5701.739 --> 5707.08
that yeah there is a weird fluctuation

5704.199 --> 5710.0199999999995
yeah that slight temperature increase

5707.08 --> 5712.96
you say right that's still well below

5710.02 --> 5716.5
normal freezing point by the way so yeah

5712.96 --> 5719.199
there are some fluctuations the overall

5716.5 --> 5721.3
effect stands though

5719.199 --> 5723.5199999999995
but hey there's might be other

5721.3 --> 5726.639
influences as well

5723.52 --> 5729.6990000000005
other than the direct influence that

5726.639 --> 5731.56
causes the gradient which is temperature

5729.699 --> 5736.0599999999995
yeah

5731.56 --> 5739.56
so let's not bypass that knowledge

5736.06 --> 5739.56
that we have right now

5755.8 --> 5763.78
is it just because you think you can

5759.159 --> 5763.78
point at some curiosity

5764.08 --> 5768.219
that that breaks the argument that's

5766.78 --> 5771.94
already won

5768.219 --> 5776.56
it's this stupid little baller weenie

5771.94 --> 5782.199
tactic that makes me so aggravated

5776.56 --> 5785.860000000001
it's like no pointed at a anomaly does

5782.199 --> 5789.5199999999995
not undo everything that's you being a

5785.86 --> 5791.98
[ __ ] [ __ ] not actually critically

5789.52 --> 5795.1
thinking about the data presented no

5791.98 --> 5798.94
that's you just over generalizing not

5795.1 --> 5801.76
actually absorbing it and saying oh look

5798.94 --> 5803.5
this is some sort of exception or

5801.76 --> 5805.5
something that means I can ignore

5803.5 --> 5809.619
everything you say now right right

5805.5 --> 5813.04
that's what that is it's [ __ ] it's

5809.619 --> 5816.639
systematically [ __ ] it's [ __ ] on

5813.04 --> 5820.119
purpose it makes you into a demented

5816.639 --> 5822.900000000001
Globe [ __ ] zealot

5820.119 --> 5822.9
you understand

5829.48 --> 5834.879999999999
yeah I can call everybody a [ __ ] when

5832.54 --> 5838.32
I feel like a [ __ ]

5834.88 --> 5840.42
I can call anybody a [ __ ]

5838.32 --> 5844.239
[ __ ]

5840.42 --> 5846.719
[ __ ] whenever I [ __ ] feel like it

5844.239 --> 5846.718999999999
[ __ ]

5846.82 --> 5852.719
it's called freedom of speech

5849.28 --> 5852.719
deal with it [ __ ]

5879.4 --> 5883.96
thank you measurements because your

5881.679 --> 5885.76
measurement doesn't counter my argument

5883.96 --> 5889.9
you [ __ ] hard

5885.76 --> 5891.639
Roger The Cabin Boy

5889.9 --> 5894.0
like what the [ __ ] do you even do in

5891.639 --> 5894.0
that cabin

5895.179 --> 5900.159
probably whacking off all day

5898.239 --> 5903.839999999999
ugh

5900.159 --> 5903.839999999999
getting really sick of this guy

5909.04 --> 5916.0
it's like every time this idiot just

5912.04 --> 5919.36
asks the question after I literally

5916.0 --> 5922.659
handed him the answer to that question

5919.36 --> 5925.78
that he asks afterward

5922.659 --> 5929.0199999999995
I literally every time I give him the

5925.78 --> 5932.5
answer then he asks the question

5929.02 --> 5936.1
that I literally answered before he asks

5932.5 --> 5938.32
the question I mean it's a talent to be

5936.1 --> 5941.400000000001
this [ __ ] [ __ ]

5938.32 --> 5941.4
it really is

5951.58 --> 5956.82
at best it could yeah it can

5954.04 --> 5961.36
yeah just because there is another

5956.82 --> 5966.4
influence doesn't undo that it is the

5961.36 --> 5969.88
primary cause as is demonstrable

5966.4 --> 5973.48
when you do it yourself on the small

5969.88 --> 5979.06
scale it causes a gradient this is

5973.48 --> 5983.0199999999995
undeniable and repeatable fact you [ __ ]

5979.06 --> 5987.659000000001
another influence does not undo that

5983.02 --> 5987.659000000001
palpable repeatable fact

5988.179 --> 5995.9800000000005
stop being a denying weenie about it and

5992.679 --> 5999.04
just move on realizing that the gas

5995.98 --> 6001.739
pressure gradient within the realm is

5999.04 --> 6005.1
caused by temperature

6001.739 --> 6008.459999999999
that is the cause yeah there may be

6005.1 --> 6010.38
other effects as well right the realm is

6008.46 --> 6012.659
a big and mysterious place there's a lot

6010.38 --> 6015.179
of things happening a lot of things that

6012.659 --> 6016.739
we don't really know how they work

6015.179 --> 6018.84
exactly

6016.739 --> 6020.82
right there's a lot of delusional

6018.84 --> 6023.76
heliocentric stories about everything

6020.82 --> 6025.799999999999
but that's just [ __ ] there's no

6023.76 --> 6028.9800000000005
actual fact to back any of that up so

6025.8 --> 6031.860000000001
I'll bust your math garbage yeah

6028.98 --> 6036.239
but what we do know is that in the small

6031.86 --> 6040.259999999999
scale you can make a gradient within a

6036.239 --> 6044.879999999999
container applying temperature

6040.26 --> 6048.3
palpable repeatable fact yeah a fact

6044.88 --> 6050.88
it's a fact it's a fact temperature

6048.3 --> 6054.3
causes a graded you can do it yourself

6050.88 --> 6057.719
in a small scale to demonstrate that it

6054.3 --> 6060.719
does yeah now there may be things

6057.719 --> 6062.76
slightly different for some reason

6060.719 --> 6065.46
like oh it's not a perfectly linear

6062.76 --> 6067.139
grade yeah yeah dude the realm is a

6065.46 --> 6068.58
mysterious place

6067.139 --> 6071.219
however

6068.58 --> 6074.46
there is a gradient

6071.219 --> 6077.219
and it is caused by temperature it's a

6074.46 --> 6079.86
repeatable fact you can do this yourself

6077.219 --> 6081.9
from the small scale to demonstrate that

6079.86 --> 6083.82
applying temperature causes a gradient

6081.9 --> 6085.138999999999
within gas pressure within a container

6083.82 --> 6090.54
yeah

6085.139 --> 6094.4400000000005
so let's not bypass that

6090.54 --> 6097.44
I referred back to the original argument

6094.44 --> 6098.638999999999
that you need containment to have gas

6097.44 --> 6100.799999999999
pressure

6098.639 --> 6103.9800000000005
yeah that's what this was born from

6100.8 --> 6107.46
that's what this is all about yeah the

6103.98 --> 6111.599999999999
gradient was your stupid baltard excuse

6107.46 --> 6113.04
to imagine how it is gravity which you

6111.6 --> 6115.1990000000005
don't even know what the [ __ ] it is

6113.04 --> 6117.659
nobody does it's a concept that's been

6115.199 --> 6119.699
invented to justify heliocentric

6117.659 --> 6121.679
[ __ ] logic

6119.699 --> 6123.599999999999
how that's supposed to keep the gas

6121.679 --> 6125.639
there yeah yeah that's you don't have

6123.6 --> 6128.400000000001
any proof of that

6125.639 --> 6130.8
so then you move on what about the

6128.4 --> 6134.28
greedy integrated yeah I just gave you

6130.8 --> 6137.1
the cause for the [ __ ] gradient yeah

6134.28 --> 6139.44
other than your [ __ ] gravity which

6137.1 --> 6141.780000000001
you don't know what it is explanation to

6139.44 --> 6143.339999999999
keep it there on your presupposed bowler

6141.78 --> 6146.94
than outer space

6143.34 --> 6149.639
yeah I gave you the answer and then you

6146.94 --> 6152.5199999999995
move on but it started entirely

6149.639 --> 6154.92
consistent gradient so that means it can

6152.52 --> 6157.139
be what the [ __ ]

6154.92 --> 6159.36
gravity which you don't know what it is

6157.139 --> 6162.2390000000005
keeping it on the ball in the outer

6159.36 --> 6165.119
space again you think that works no it

6162.239 --> 6166.4
doesn't the temperature causes the

6165.119 --> 6170.099999999999
gradient

6166.4 --> 6173.58
within the container within the

6170.1 --> 6175.5
containment The Limited volume of where

6173.58 --> 6177.96
the gas pressure is within this realm

6175.5 --> 6180.119
yeah that's what makes it possible

6177.96 --> 6182.28
yeah not gravity which you don't know

6180.119 --> 6183.9
what it is

6182.28 --> 6187.699
get it

6183.9 --> 6187.699
am I getting through to you ball [ __ ]

6205.86 --> 6212.759999999999
what's a good dinner made of

6209.639 --> 6215.04
find out you [ __ ] why don't you go

6212.76 --> 6218.219
[ __ ] find out you're so curious about

6215.04 --> 6219.6
it you go find out what the container is

6218.219 --> 6222.179
made of yeah

6219.6 --> 6224.04
I'm more concerned with knowing that

6222.179 --> 6227.46
there has to be a container because we

6224.04 --> 6229.56
got gas pressure yeah now you go find

6227.46 --> 6233.04
out what that [ __ ] container is made

6229.56 --> 6235.7390000000005
of if you if you really care or were you

6233.04 --> 6237.48
just trying to wander off again like oh

6235.739 --> 6239.159
you're the Flat Earth and you don't know

6237.48 --> 6240.9
something so I'm gonna go back to your

6239.159 --> 6243.78
[ __ ] little ball again and imagine

6240.9 --> 6245.46
how it's all put there by gravity didn't

6243.78 --> 6246.659
you that's why you brought it up you

6245.46 --> 6248.639
[ __ ]

6246.659 --> 6250.199
that's why you brought it up didn't you

6248.639 --> 6252.42
yeah

6250.199 --> 6254.46
oh you have to know what to Containers

6252.42 --> 6256.32
yeah we don't know nobody knows what

6254.46 --> 6259.139
this [ __ ] container is we just know

6256.32 --> 6261.659
it's there because there can only be a

6259.139 --> 6265.5
limited volume or we wouldn't have gas

6261.659 --> 6268.04
pressure you understand ball [ __ ]

6265.5 --> 6268.04
you understand

6283.32 --> 6290.04
yeah laugh it up Fundy

6285.96 --> 6292.08
keep laughing you're a [ __ ] Roger The

6290.04 --> 6295.0199999999995
Cabin Boy

6292.08 --> 6298.139
cabin squirt boy

6295.02 --> 6300.2390000000005
you're a dumbass

6298.139 --> 6302.04
you still [ __ ] believe it's a ball

6300.239 --> 6304.379999999999
even though everything that's been

6302.04 --> 6308.219
discussed so far proves that it cannot

6304.38 --> 6311.4800000000005
be anything what you thought it was

6308.219 --> 6311.4800000000005
do you understand that

6328.98 --> 6334.04
yes you are tiny Womble yes you are

6335.28 --> 6338.46
[Music]

6338.82 --> 6341.84
oh what's that

6343.86 --> 6347.7789999999995
yes

6344.68 --> 6347.779
[Music]

6350.58 --> 6354.9
that's a good call I would actually I

6353.4 --> 6356.82
would have probably just banned him

6354.9 --> 6359.659
because it's just another

6356.82 --> 6359.659
[ __ ]

6360.36 --> 6364.86
yeah I'm gonna ban him

6362.1 --> 6366.96
good call though

6364.86 --> 6369.0599999999995
I'm not in the middle of a conversation

6366.96 --> 6372.139
with him

6369.06 --> 6372.139
so that's fine

6373.86 --> 6379.5599999999995
because of course you gotta go at home

6377.28 --> 6381.36
because you think that I'm at homing you

6379.56 --> 6384.179
know you think that I'm at homing you

6381.36 --> 6387.0
for calling you a [ __ ]

6384.179 --> 6389.88
you you feel addressed like how dare you

6387.0 --> 6393.239
that homie I'm just gonna add home you

6389.88 --> 6397.159000000001
what you fail to notice

6393.239 --> 6397.159
is not really an at-home

6397.199 --> 6402.54
it's

6398.46 --> 6406.28
empirical data based description that

6402.54 --> 6409.8
can be justified to a professional level

6406.28 --> 6413.099999999999
on every aspect

6409.8 --> 6416.28
it's palpably provable

6413.1 --> 6418.320000000001
that you're a [ __ ] Roger

6416.28 --> 6420.84
and Tiny Womble it's good that you

6418.32 --> 6423.48
recognize it for the actions that you do

6420.84 --> 6425.46
right because being a [ __ ] doesn't

6423.48 --> 6428.638999999999
make you a bad person it just makes you

6425.46 --> 6431.04
really [ __ ] annoying and stupid when

6428.639 --> 6433.56
you're confronted with things you refuse

6431.04 --> 6435.659
to accept

6433.56 --> 6437.9400000000005
right that's all

6435.659 --> 6440.159
don't have to be bad tiny Womble is not

6437.94 --> 6442.678999999999
a an evil man

6440.159 --> 6444.42
he's just kind of stupid

6442.679 --> 6447.679
when you push him

6444.42 --> 6447.679
on these subjects

6453.179 --> 6456.56
yeah that's right

6467.159 --> 6471.96
right anyway I'll be back in whoa time

6470.04 --> 6473.46
has been flying I'll be back in two

6471.96 --> 6476.36
minutes

6473.46 --> 6476.36
foreign

6531.6 --> 6534.320000000001
amazing

6535.63 --> 6538.88
[Music]

6562.56 --> 6567.320000000001
and I'm back did you miss me

6585.599 --> 6590.58
Roger The Cabin Boy Neil deGrasse I said

6588.42 --> 6594.06
no I don't think so Tom Barker I don't

6590.58 --> 6596.46
know where you would get that this is

6594.06 --> 6598.92
like Neil wouldn't make those arguments

6596.46 --> 6602.76
he wouldn't talk like that

6598.92 --> 6605.9400000000005
like the thing about Neil is

6602.76 --> 6609.3
a dubious character but at least he

6605.94 --> 6612.54
knows when to step away right like that

6609.3 --> 6614.28
time when in the interviewer asked what

6612.54 --> 6617.04
is gravity

6614.28 --> 6619.199
we don't know next question

6617.04 --> 6621.599
yeah that sounded really funny and that

6619.199 --> 6624.9
was really good because

6621.599 --> 6627.900000000001
it was actually the truth

6624.9 --> 6629.82
oh you didn't realize that

6627.9 --> 6632.46
you thought he was just joking did you

6629.82 --> 6633.78
yeah no no he was just speaking the

6632.46 --> 6636.599
truth

6633.78 --> 6637.98
yeah kneel the grass knows when to step

6636.599 --> 6641.58
away

6637.98 --> 6644.0599999999995
this guy obviously doesn't

6641.58 --> 6644.0599999999995
so

6649.5 --> 6654.48
when he backed off yeah but why would

6652.32 --> 6656.58
why in God's name would he go and debate

6654.48 --> 6659.5199999999995
Eric debate

6656.58 --> 6661.8
why would he debate anyone

6659.52 --> 6663.42
why would he ever debate a flat earther

6661.8 --> 6665.88
ever

6663.42 --> 6668.3
like even if they were a controlled

6665.88 --> 6671.400000000001
opposition numpty

6668.3 --> 6674.219
actor playing a dumb flat earther like

6671.4 --> 6676.679
even why would he even do that

6674.219 --> 6679.88
he has no reason

6676.679 --> 6679.88
to ever do that

6691.56 --> 6697.619000000001
too scared no no why scared no he just

6695.46 --> 6699.179
doesn't need to do that it's not part of

6697.619 --> 6701.639
what he does

6699.179 --> 6703.92
near the grass is not gonna go in debate

6701.639 --> 6706.38
with a flat earther ever

6703.92 --> 6709.7390000000005
there's no point

6706.38 --> 6712.34
it doesn't help his function why would

6709.739 --> 6712.339999999999
he do that

6720.179 --> 6724.8
he said he would

6722.28 --> 6727.5
that's weird that's kind of weird that

6724.8 --> 6731.219
he even said that

6727.5 --> 6735.06
maybe maybe there is some kind of a

6731.219 --> 6737.46
pressure going on on his job maybe

6735.06 --> 6739.38
people that are funding him

6737.46 --> 6741.119
are actually trying to push him like

6739.38 --> 6741.96
yeah you gotta go into debate or

6741.119 --> 6743.58
something

6741.96 --> 6746.159
you got to make a stand

6743.58 --> 6748.5599999999995
because they don't realize what Nila

6746.159 --> 6750.0599999999995
realizes and that it that it's all an

6748.56 --> 6754.099
act

6750.06 --> 6754.099
that he can't actually win an argument

6755.46 --> 6760.38
right so maybe he is just kind of giving

6757.92 --> 6763.02
off the flare now like oh yeah we'll go

6760.38 --> 6765.96
into debate sure sure it's all a bluff

6763.02 --> 6768.900000000001
he knows it's a bluff it's an act like

6765.96 --> 6769.9800000000005
this man is an actor if I've ever seen

6768.9 --> 6772.92
one

6769.98 --> 6776.04
he knows what he peddles his [ __ ] he

6772.92 --> 6779.28
knows he must no There Is No Escape to

6776.04 --> 6782.699
this he must know otherwise he couldn't

6779.28 --> 6786.48
put down the story mechanics the way he

6782.699 --> 6790.08
does if he didn't know he has to know

6786.48 --> 6792.0599999999995
and when you actually know then you also

6790.08 --> 6793.5
know that you can't win a debate against

6792.06 --> 6796.56
a flat earther

6793.5 --> 6798.659
that even engaging in a debate with a

6796.56 --> 6799.92
flat earther when you're in a position

6798.659 --> 6803.28
that he is

6799.92 --> 6806.28
is only ever going to yield detrimental

6803.28 --> 6810.199
results he knows it

6806.28 --> 6810.199
he must know there's no Escape

6828.239 --> 6835.218999999999
he's a good comedian yeah I do well to

6831.719 --> 6835.219
be fair yeah I do think he's funny

6836.46 --> 6842.58
I think Neil deGrasse Tyson is funny

6840.42 --> 6845.84
he's an Entertainer

6842.58 --> 6845.84
he has talent for that

6861.659 --> 6865.679
what

6863.46 --> 6868.4
drunken bullet

6865.679 --> 6868.4
what's

6868.92 --> 6873.32
they just said something to my PayPal

6871.08 --> 6873.32
again

6874.08 --> 6878.719
yeah by the way I almost forgot talking

6876.0 --> 6878.719
about which

6880.139 --> 6884.219
Paul Connell

6882.06 --> 6886.679
somebody had typically bump into during

6884.219 --> 6889.46
the flatter of debates

6886.679 --> 6889.46
in the chat

6890.76 --> 6897.56
he

6893.219 --> 6897.56
gave me a PayPal too yesterday evening

6899.76 --> 6906.06
right ah thank you drunken bullies one

6903.239 --> 6910.259999999999
one four one one yeah okay even little

6906.06 --> 6912.92
bits help so I really appreciate that

6910.26 --> 6912.92
don't worry

6923.94 --> 6927.98
right think about it like this

6928.92 --> 6933.3
a lot

6931.08 --> 6937.76
of small amounts

6933.3 --> 6937.76
coming with Goodwill from good people

6938.159 --> 6941.598999999999
that live a moral life

6942.599 --> 6949.679
is much more valuable than the same

6945.48 --> 6951.0599999999995
amount given by one rich stinker

6949.679 --> 6953.46
palpably

6951.06 --> 6955.679
it's more valuable it's not just the

6953.46 --> 6957.06
money it's also the energy you get with

6955.679 --> 6961.46
the action

6957.06 --> 6961.46
and where that energy comes from right

6963.599 --> 6970.4400000000005
so by that sense I tried to praise

6967.139 --> 6972.42
people that give me small amounts just

6970.44 --> 6975.36
as much as people that give much more

6972.42 --> 6977.04
even though yeah much more is better

6975.36 --> 6979.5
it helps

6977.04 --> 6981.659
but yeah the in the intention the energy

6979.5 --> 6984.679
behind it is also very important and I

6981.659 --> 6984.679
really appreciate it

6984.84 --> 6991.88
that you continually support me even

6987.599 --> 6991.88
with little bits so thank you very much

6995.639 --> 6999.84
what I'll put something on the mail

6997.92 --> 7002.619
today what

6999.84 --> 7002.619000000001
uh

7002.659 --> 7007.9
well you could contact me on Skype too

7012.38 --> 7016.599
I would prefer that Dutch sailor

7022.699 --> 7026.32
didn't you have my address already

7027.199 --> 7031.9
right but yeah sure I'll give you my

7029.719 --> 7031.9
address

7032.179 --> 7037.46
on Skype that would be easier because I

7035.239 --> 7038.839999999999
I kind of want to go after this to get

7037.46 --> 7041.599
groceries

7038.84 --> 7044.119000000001
show is almost ending I really had a

7041.599 --> 7048.619000000001
good time it was good to

7044.119 --> 7052.659
blow off some steam Gall retards retards

7048.619 --> 7052.659
and lay down the total

7053.119 --> 7059.54
yeah the problems

7055.52 --> 7062.7390000000005
right the inability to recognize

7059.54 --> 7062.739
how things work

7067.94 --> 7072.159
so I hope you were amused as well

7076.58 --> 7082.159
and again I I'd like to emphasize though

7079.04 --> 7084.92
that maybe in a way just saying [ __ ]

7082.159 --> 7086.0599999999995
is misplaced in a technical sense it's

7084.92 --> 7087.92
just

7086.06 --> 7089.42
really difficult

7087.92 --> 7092.78
right

7089.42 --> 7095.119
because actual retards like people they

7092.78 --> 7096.92
were kind of born that way

7095.119 --> 7099.0199999999995
and they just have like serious

7096.92 --> 7102.1990000000005
cognitive difficulties

7099.02 --> 7105.56
they can be great people

7102.199 --> 7107.36
that with the limitations they have they

7105.56 --> 7110.54
really do their best and they'll still

7107.36 --> 7113.239
have that pure Spirit a lot of the time

7110.54 --> 7116.96
to make good judgment calls and to not

7113.239 --> 7119.178999999999
get caught up in squirting and lie

7116.96 --> 7122.32
pretending right not a guarantee though

7119.179 --> 7125.0
not again even even retards Clinic like

7122.32 --> 7127.96
physiological physical retards can still

7125.0 --> 7127.96
have that behavior

7128.0 --> 7133.88
but in my experience the overall less

7130.88 --> 7135.8
cognitive ability you have the more the

7133.88 --> 7139.46
less tendency you have

7135.8 --> 7140.96
to try and fool around and sin

7139.46 --> 7143.719
right

7140.96 --> 7146.119
these people however

7143.719 --> 7148.52
it's like they're spiritually [ __ ]

7146.119 --> 7152.299999999999
it's like it's not a physical thing it's

7148.52 --> 7156.320000000001
like they make it like that they act

7152.3 --> 7159.619000000001
full like how do you call that method

7156.32 --> 7162.08
acting like retards I think that's

7159.619 --> 7166.659
actually a good terminology for this

7162.08 --> 7171.0199999999995
these ball Tarts they're meth method

7166.659 --> 7174.259999999999
acting retards which means they actually

7171.02 --> 7176.599
become that right it's almost like they

7174.26 --> 7177.92
acted so well you can't even blame them

7176.599 --> 7180.139
for their

7177.92 --> 7184.04
stupidities anymore

7180.139 --> 7185.96
just like a clinical [ __ ] person you

7184.04 --> 7190.04
can't like be like Amma come on how can

7185.96 --> 7192.92
you not know the square root of so of

7190.04 --> 7196.04
the 12 or something right

7192.92 --> 7198.7390000000005
or F uh what is it 144 like how can you

7196.04 --> 7201.739
not know that how can you not count like

7198.739 --> 7204.0199999999995
that's unreasonable right well people

7201.739 --> 7206.178999999999
that are clinically [ __ ] can't

7204.02 --> 7209.360000000001
really snap out of that because that's

7206.179 --> 7212.8
just how they work

7209.36 --> 7215.48
these ball Tarts however they could

7212.8 --> 7218.78
theoretically snap out of it if they

7215.48 --> 7220.879999999999
weren't such character act like what do

7218.78 --> 7224.9
you call method actors

7220.88 --> 7227.42
if they weren't so entrenched in that

7224.9 --> 7230.0599999999995
way of presenting themselves and

7227.42 --> 7232.28
bypassing facts to uphold the dream

7230.06 --> 7234.1990000000005
they're like dream jugglers in a way

7232.28 --> 7236.84
right they juggle the dream but it gets

7234.199 --> 7239.54
very messy and they get very stupid but

7236.84 --> 7242.4800000000005
they get so caught up in the Act and the

7239.54 --> 7244.28
method act that they become like

7242.48 --> 7246.32
clinically [ __ ]

7244.28 --> 7249.34
but you can't snap them out of that they

7246.32 --> 7249.34
can't snap out of it

7250.52 --> 7255.1990000000005
it's weird

7252.199 --> 7258.739
yeah look at me taking it very serious

7255.199 --> 7260.598999999999
but it is kind of serious it is

7258.739 --> 7264.919999999999
an odd thing

7260.599 --> 7267.1990000000005
that this exists in people's heads

7264.92 --> 7270.139
right but I am rounding out the show now

7267.199 --> 7271.94
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7270.139 --> 7273.679

7271.94 --> 7276.32
good it had absolutely nothing to do

7273.679 --> 7278.36
with the title guard

7276.32 --> 7282.04
I'm happy about that because it's like

7278.36 --> 7282.04
Biden is not exactly

7282.199 --> 7287.08
