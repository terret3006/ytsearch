2.27 --> 9.3
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.0 --> 14.49
early-bird number 58 I'm your host

9.3 --> 18.51
Arwen and yeah today again the same type

14.49 --> 21.27
of weather is yesterday not really warm

18.51 --> 28.92
not very cold you can walk outside

21.27 --> 31.289
without a coat if you like but yeah I am

28.92 --> 37.649
to be honest not feeling all that great

31.289 --> 41.7
today and started pretty much two days

37.649 --> 44.82
ago and yeah after watching that hangout

41.7 --> 47.579
yesterday right here flat earther new

44.82 --> 57.379
board 57 that's some really good moments

47.579 --> 61.739000000000004
but yeah I was kind of shocked to see

57.379 --> 64.54899999999999
the energy that I was displaying and at

61.739 --> 68.75999999999999
the time I thought I was just being

64.549 --> 76.43900000000001
energetic but it didn't really feel all

68.76 --> 78.36
that good in retrospect and yeah I'm

76.439 --> 81.05999999999999
just dissatisfied about it

78.36 --> 83.909
although yeah technically technically

81.06 --> 86.04
the the thing with conspiracy or

83.909 --> 88.76
conspiracy cat's sorry

86.04 --> 92.14
that

88.76 --> 96.77000000000001
I was technically correct very much so

92.14 --> 101.96000000000001
but I was just unreasonably interruptive

96.77 --> 104.66
and it's very odd to see that back so

101.96 --> 106.94
yeah I was correct and he was talking

104.66 --> 107.96
absolute gibberish and red herrings and

106.94 --> 113.75
all that [ __ ]

107.96 --> 118.42999999999999
it was extremely polite and I really did

113.75 --> 121.55
wasn't to be fair to my audience and to

118.43 --> 123.65
myself and I'm kind of disappointed at

121.55 --> 128.119
that that I couldn't bring up the

123.65 --> 134.89000000000001
patience to do the social part of the

128.119 --> 134.89
hangout properly in my opinion and

136.23 --> 142.67999999999998
then it's not like I really owe

139.489 --> 145.43
conspiracy cats an apology because even

142.68 --> 148.86
afterwards over Skype he just started

145.43 --> 152.4
misbehaving and going complete baller

148.86 --> 154.739
troll [ __ ] over me basically keeping

152.4 --> 158.91
on whining and whining it I'm telling

154.739 --> 160.68
him look dude stop it stop talking I'm

158.91 --> 163.379
gonna block you and just kept ago and

160.68 --> 164.25
kept on going kept on going so yeah I'm

163.379 --> 167.73
gonna block him

164.25 --> 171.86
okay well that sucks and now he's old

167.73 --> 175.67
justified lugosi it's all same and lose

171.86 --> 179.16000000000003
I'm right all that kind of typical

175.67 --> 186.02999999999997
nauseating baller [ __ ] religious

179.16 --> 189.87
fanatical [ __ ] but I still feel

186.03 --> 193.14000000000001
dissatisfied about it all because I

189.87 --> 197.459
could have done a lot better bring up

193.14 --> 201.23899999999998
the patience that actually let him take

197.459 --> 204.239
his diarrhea dump all over reality just

201.239 --> 208.34900000000002
by his own pace and just let him finish

204.239 --> 211.889
that [ __ ] before I flush it should have

208.349 --> 215.92999999999998
done that but yeah now it is what it is

211.889 --> 219.72
at least technically the true message

215.93 --> 221.549
has come across and that is pretty

219.72 --> 224.9
obvious and I think that I got a lot of

221.549 --> 224.9
appreciation from it

225.42 --> 234.83999999999997
from the other people from the other

229.5 --> 237.12
flat earthers oh yeah also by the way

234.84 --> 240.27
and I don't know if he's even gonna find

237.12 --> 242.31
out or that he's just ran away because I

240.27 --> 246.20000000000002
heard him but yeah

242.31 --> 249.53
I also heard my tone against Riley and

246.2 --> 252.45
yeah I was really pissed off by his

249.53 --> 255.09
childish approach of things demanding to

252.45 --> 258.0
be part of my panel with conspiracy cats

255.09 --> 262.68
which is absurd this is not the flag of

258.0 --> 265.65
debates but I kind of overreacted and I

262.68 --> 269.73
feel sorry to him genuinely so Riley I'm

265.65 --> 274.5
sorry that I shouted at you the way I

269.73 --> 277.11
did technically you were being

274.5 --> 279.45
unreasonable but there's no need there

277.11 --> 283.56
wasn't a need for me to be unreasonable

279.45 --> 286.22999999999996
back because of that and I guess it is

283.56 --> 290.18
the circumstances because I was really

286.23 --> 294.78000000000003
agitated and not so much even about

290.18 --> 296.79
things among us or in flat earth however

294.78 --> 299.92999999999995
frustrating and pressuring this may be

296.79 --> 303.09000000000003
but it was mostly because of the

299.93 --> 305.28000000000003
rainforest issue that I addressed at the

303.09 --> 309.06
beginning of the Hangout because that

305.28 --> 315.2
thing is really really close to my heart

309.06 --> 315.2
has been since I was very young so

317.15 --> 324.229
and it still weighs heavily upon me the

320.36 --> 328.66900000000004
situation what can you do I just got

324.229 --> 332.63
this terrible sensation like the

328.669 --> 339.19899999999996
collective satanic spirit in all

332.63 --> 342.02
humanity has sets has said it's its

339.199 --> 346.31
obsession over just freakin destroying

342.02 --> 349.82
this place to detriment mankind and I

346.31 --> 351.71
can literally see almost the voices

349.82 --> 354.59
inside the heads of these people telling

351.71 --> 357.169
yeah I know this is gonna burn humanity

354.59 --> 360.5
but we need to do this you need to do

357.169 --> 365.35999999999996
this we need to do the surgery on

360.5 --> 371.6
ourselves like that I need to do it and

365.36 --> 376.03000000000003
it just it disparages me it disparages

371.6 --> 376.03000000000003
me that I hear this voice in their head

379.23 --> 383.74
and

381.16 --> 386.08000000000004
I can almost I've been wanting to

383.74 --> 389.11
consult with my healer just about this

386.08 --> 391.93
and I know I kind of know what they're

389.11 --> 393.73
gonna say what the angels are gonna say

391.93 --> 398.35
they say it's all part of the freakin

393.73 --> 401.59000000000003
plan don't worry about it no matter

398.35 --> 405.48
where it's going it's going to transform

401.59 --> 405.47999999999996
as planned like that

406.05 --> 413.37
and I guess I'm not serene enough that I

411.24 --> 418.28000000000003
can just let this go at this one but I

413.37 --> 424.37
feel enticed aggravated in my very

418.28 --> 424.36999999999995
foundation in my physical being like

425.919 --> 434.34
why isn't everyone feeling like this why

431.499 --> 438.09900000000005
aren't people feeling the pain of this

434.34 --> 443.49899999999997
responsibility how can they even avoid

438.099 --> 448.659
this I don't know but I am gonna try to

443.499 --> 452.28900000000004
calm down at least at least I'm

448.659 --> 456.61
realizing that I'm just upset and that's

452.289 --> 460.77
good and let's just try to get back to

456.61 --> 460.77000000000004
to the topics at hand

468.41 --> 477.56
yeah Rasta I don't need any advice from

471.89 --> 480.8
you in that regard okay

477.56 --> 486.86
my healer is very damn good and he is

480.8 --> 489.2
effective instantly effective so yeah if

486.86 --> 491.83000000000004
he'd asked me for money I would give it

489.2 --> 491.83
to him if I could

496.33 --> 504.55
I'm not the only guy he are not the only

499.58 --> 510.65999999999997
person he helps oh he is a great

504.55 --> 514.9
a great asset to humanity and I will

510.66 --> 518.659
absolutely support him as long as he is

514.9 --> 523.6899999999999
and there's still a lot I have to learn

518.659 --> 523.6899999999999
what anyway let's get back to Flat Earth

527.78 --> 533.99
yeah harass that you have no clue about

531.14 --> 536.9499999999999
any of that you don't know you don't

533.99 --> 540.47
understand because you're in your head

536.95 --> 544.1
and you're good at what you do this

540.47 --> 549.5600000000001
that's not your realm that's not where

544.1 --> 552.6800000000001
you think so don't even try to to

549.56 --> 556.04
denigrate that or anything really it's

552.68 --> 560.17
not your place to do that it's not your

556.04 --> 560.17
feel thank you

564.11 --> 568.14
but

566.3 --> 571.2199999999999
yeah

568.14 --> 571.22
I think that

573.96 --> 580.2800000000001
conspiracy cat situations yesterday was

576.69 --> 580.2800000000001
good it was it had to happen

580.82 --> 584.85
and yeah

582.78 --> 586.98
if anything like this is gonna happen

584.85 --> 588.63
again with another type of baller cuz

586.98 --> 591.9
conspiracy cats probably in town again

588.63 --> 596.01
not gonna come back after this wouldn't

591.9 --> 600.15
blame him I will need to pay more

596.01 --> 602.37
attention to my to my nerves and to my

600.15 --> 608.61
discipline to get this thing going for

602.37 --> 611.94
real and just let them finish dumping

608.61 --> 613.62
their diarrhea before I flush it that's

611.94 --> 623.82
basically what I'm gonna cuz I'll call

613.62 --> 627.39
it right now also I am disturbed by some

623.82 --> 629.9100000000001
of the new infighting behaviors that are

627.39 --> 633.42
starting to arrive among people that

629.91 --> 637.4699999999999
I've been socially dealing with for some

633.42 --> 640.2299999999999
time now I'm highly highly disturbed by

637.47 --> 645.96
this behavior from several angles from

640.23 --> 648.87
several people no idea what the hell you

645.96 --> 657.5300000000001
people are thinking engaging in this

648.87 --> 657.53
kind of juvenile behavior ridiculous

657.66 --> 662.39
and I'm not talking about Pete Mars I'm

659.91 --> 665.66
talking about flat earthers panelists

662.39 --> 672.27
people that have even been on here

665.66 --> 674.9
you know the situated between or rather

672.27 --> 679.39
from Eric BOE Shane

674.9 --> 682.6899999999999
towards Jose does it make any

679.39 --> 685.209
since dude unless you're just holding

682.69 --> 687.339
back something because all these

685.209 --> 688.899
complaints you made to him and the links

687.339 --> 693.87
you showed me that was absolutely

688.899 --> 693.87
ridiculous that

694.52 --> 700.91
that was so nonsensical there was no

698.48 --> 702.95
evidence of anything who basically

700.91 --> 706.88
showed me Dell ranting and raving

702.95 --> 709.9100000000001
against him mu while now that proves

706.88 --> 711.8
everything because they'll never rants

709.91 --> 713.87
and raves to anyone unless there's a

711.8 --> 716.3599999999999
good reason right wrong

713.87 --> 718.339
he doesn't do every freakin one so it's

716.36 --> 724.5500000000001
ridiculous it's Jill was just in a bad

718.339 --> 727.97
mood then see did this relates this

724.55 --> 731.029
proves anything yeah I know

727.97 --> 733.85
Jose's background I know he started out

731.029 --> 737.43
as it's pretty much a troll and he came

733.85 --> 738.94
out of the baller sector into this

737.43 --> 741.9899999999999
what

738.94 --> 741.99
this weird

743.74 --> 748.41
this accusations against I just don't

748.69 --> 752.85
why are you getting so incredibly pissed

751.12 --> 755.75
off

752.85 --> 759.91
about this guy

755.75 --> 759.91
what is it and what ever has he done

764.2 --> 769.6
just don't get it feels like you guys

767.65 --> 772.9
are like acting out or something over

769.6 --> 775.0500000000001
the winter nerves just like I am in my

772.9 --> 777.149
own way acting out

775.05 --> 783.92
at least I know that I'm doing it and

777.149 --> 783.92
I'm trying to stop that so should you

788.69 --> 795.2900000000001
alright cool

791.19 --> 795.2900000000001
ranty wants to come on okay

796.089 --> 799.0500000000001

801.42 --> 804.5889999999999
see what he has to say

810.49 --> 812.55
ah

816.82 --> 822.1800000000001
okay

818.95 --> 824.98
and well I'm gonna be waiting for Randy

822.18 --> 831.519
probably pop in any second I'm gonna get

824.98 --> 833.73
myself some tea hold on good afternoon I

831.519 --> 833.73
win

841.94 --> 850.46
and he's running to the loo oh we're

847.82 --> 858.4100000000001
scared him up which one was it

850.46 --> 861.3100000000001
I see so he's left me to hang it to

858.41 --> 861.31
handle all this ugly

865.57 --> 878.99
what sort of host is this well I'll let

876.44 --> 880.7600000000001
you I'll let you up I'll let you up yeah

878.99 --> 882.83
welcome on the panel thanks for coming

880.76 --> 884.54
man I listened the first thing I want to

882.83 --> 886.7
say to you is that you seemed a little

884.54 --> 889.49
bit disheartened this morning when he

886.7 --> 892.5200000000001
first came on and you said conspiracy

889.49 --> 894.73
caps was acting really nice and you felt

892.52 --> 896.93
like I was a little bit abrupt to him

894.73 --> 898.58
accessory etcetera and that's how we

896.93 --> 901.37
perceived that's how he shows himself to

898.58 --> 903.71
his subscribers and anytime that he's

901.37 --> 905.0600000000001
actually on cam on YouTube that's where

903.71 --> 908.99
does yeah off cam

905.06 --> 910.5799999999999
he's a vile little [ __ ] yeah I've had it

908.99 --> 912.23
firsthand on I Twitter

910.58 --> 915.5600000000001
I have only first done bombs where I did

912.23 --> 919.3100000000001
email Twitter you name it is he's a vile

915.56 --> 921.5899999999999
vile little [ __ ] I know Randy absolutely

919.31 --> 923.39
I'm les anyway I told a little lie there

921.59 --> 925.76
because I actually got confused between

923.39 --> 928.1899999999999
conspiracy counts and Sam and um and it

925.76 --> 929.96
was Simon done the emailed me not comes

928.19 --> 934.7
Bertie cats before I've definitely had

929.96 --> 936.89
his vile on my Twitter feed and lies so

934.7 --> 941.12
I wouldn't worry about it well there's

936.89 --> 943.64
the thing so did i on skype and i even

941.12 --> 946.73
said that but the thing is i have to

943.64 --> 949.16
judge the situation by what is there and

946.73 --> 952.7
i can't judge him on other actions and

949.16 --> 957.1999999999999
he in re-enter it just was very polite

952.7 --> 960.44
and extremely patient and that is

957.2 --> 962.24
remarkable and i wasn't and that's just

960.44 --> 965.0300000000001
a fact it doesn't make him any more

962.24 --> 967.76
right he was still red herring and as I

965.03 --> 971.3
said diarrhea dumping his science

967.76 --> 972.93
fiction nonsense all over the place but

971.3 --> 976.5889999999999
yeah socially he was

972.93 --> 980.67
just very tight and I wasn't and I

976.589 --> 983.399
regret that it it it did tracks from the

980.67 --> 985.3499999999999
value of the entire hangout I think no

983.399 --> 987.42
no too much but it could have been

985.35 --> 989.94
better and I just feel disappointed

987.42 --> 991.77
now you handled it alright I'll be

989.94 --> 995.58
honest as well I mean he had no argument

991.77 --> 998.399
and we kept asking him for his proof I

995.58 --> 1002.24
heard him say things like football

998.399 --> 1005.72
crowds prove the globe no he didn't we

1002.24 --> 1008.149
didn't get when you asked him about

1005.72 --> 1009.589
particles and entropy and stuff like

1008.149 --> 1012.14
this he started talking about a football

1009.589 --> 1013.8800000000001
crowd I'm trying to do an analogy with

1012.14 --> 1016.0699999999999
that and I just had to laugh I'm

1013.88 --> 1018.47
thinking and it'll stain real yeah is

1016.07 --> 1022.48
that is that his proof of the globe come

1018.47 --> 1027.38
on oh I mean it's ridiculous philosophy

1022.48 --> 1031.88
stories and like comparisons that that

1027.38 --> 1036.1100000000001
don't match that the comparisons he made

1031.88 --> 1040.189
just were so upset they obviously don't

1036.11 --> 1043.2199999999998
work the same now the thing is that

1040.189 --> 1045.1100000000001
fails dude forget what his name was

1043.22 --> 1047.27
called now I mean just look just bear

1045.11 --> 1052.07
with me let me see what yeah

1047.27 --> 1053.54
kr oh that is apparently it was this guy

1052.07 --> 1054.8
that's been researching Flat Earth for

1053.54 --> 1056.33
the past year now he doesn't have a

1054.8 --> 1057.8
channel he doesn't have any videos or

1056.33 --> 1060.32
pub it's the first time he'd ever done a

1057.8 --> 1062.99
debate and that essentially I don't know

1060.32 --> 1065.09
how conspiracy cats wangled it to get

1062.99 --> 1067.25
him to go on a non-sequitur show but he

1065.09 --> 1070.01
apparently he got himself on there last

1067.25 --> 1072.559
night he Benny - Deeb a conspiracy caps

1070.01 --> 1074.69
with godless engineer there Steve McCray

1072.559 --> 1078.35
and read rhetoric pops in as well so

1074.69 --> 1081.53
this poor guy who has never done a

1078.35 --> 1086.6
proper debate goes in against these four

1081.53 --> 1087.92
clowns right and conspiracy cats was if

1086.6 --> 1088.51
I'd have been in there he'd have got

1087.92 --> 1091.73
owned

1088.51 --> 1094.1299999999999
so I mean this guy looks so many things

1091.73 --> 1097.79
though because he didn't have the

1094.13 --> 1100.3700000000001
knowledge or the ability to debate them

1097.79 --> 1102.4099999999999
properly probably had the concentration

1100.37 --> 1104.6599999999999
so essentially they were like basically

1102.41 --> 1106.5500000000002
got a lady I'm not gonna call him a lame

1104.66 --> 1109.21
dog but in in into

1106.55 --> 1111.97
of the argument he wasn't our best

1109.21 --> 1116.0900000000001
representative let's put it that way and

1111.97 --> 1119.69
he they I mean conspiracy cats

1116.09 --> 1121.55
completely lied the old face wide I'm

1119.69 --> 1123.56
actually partway through making the

1121.55 --> 1127.85
video right now about it actually wait

1123.56 --> 1130.58
on our side that was honest equity who

1127.85 --> 1132.98
was on outside it was a guy called kr oh

1130.58 --> 1136.6399999999999
and he'd never actually debated anybody

1132.98 --> 1140.9
on the subject so okay so haven't seen

1136.64 --> 1144.17
it it I was essentially he was settled

1140.9 --> 1148.7
to be you know it was cell to fall

1144.17 --> 1152.0
basically anyway I've watched the first

1148.7 --> 1153.1100000000001
two points that we brought out it's

1152.0 --> 1155.42
pathetic

1153.11 --> 1157.79
not only does he lie what he uses a

1155.42 --> 1161.8100000000002
model on the first one and he's talking

1157.79 --> 1164.17
about earthquakes and then he brings up

1161.81 --> 1166.3999999999999
this representation of the earth with a

1164.17 --> 1168.6200000000001
solid center in the middle then the

1166.4 --> 1171.8300000000002
molten iron core around it and stuff and

1168.62 --> 1173.2399999999998
I'm like yeah so okay so this is their

1171.83 --> 1176.33
diagram this is what they're trying to

1173.24 --> 1178.04
say and nobody knows firstly if this is

1176.33 --> 1180.53
accurate because nobody's been down

1178.04 --> 1182.54
there you're making an assumption of how

1180.53 --> 1187.48
these waves are going to propagate back

1182.54 --> 1190.25
to the surface based on a presupposition

1187.48 --> 1191.78
that you have the earth in these

1190.25 --> 1194.18
particular layers and how they're

1191.78 --> 1197.3
actually built up and even conspiracy

1194.18 --> 1202.16
cats did have to concede that if it

1197.3 --> 1204.29
wasn't the design that they had thought

1202.16 --> 1207.38
it was then they would get a different

1204.29 --> 1209.21
set of results back so you know I mean

1207.38 --> 1211.88
he kinda debunked his own argument in a

1209.21 --> 1213.23
way but it's just pathetic and then the

1211.88 --> 1216.3100000000002
second one I mean this poor guy they

1213.23 --> 1218.8700000000001
used one of my videos to jump on him and

1216.31 --> 1220.76
he lied about the elevation above sea

1218.87 --> 1222.32
level he lied about the tide high he

1220.76 --> 1224.48
lied about everything about this

1222.32 --> 1225.8
observation to put this guy in a

1224.48 --> 1230.3600000000001
position where he didn't know what to

1225.8 --> 1232.1299999999999
say he didn't know what to say I mean if

1230.36 --> 1234.29
conspiracy cats has taken the time to

1232.13 --> 1236.0300000000002
take a video of mine and to take

1234.29 --> 1237.86
screenshots of it and actually get the

1236.03 --> 1239.84
video up and play it and yet he doesn't

1237.86 --> 1240.4699999999998
have the ability to listen with his ears

1239.84 --> 1243.1399999999999
with meat

1240.47 --> 1245.929
him the data the height above the tithe

1243.14 --> 1249.169
that adds high etc he doesn't have that

1245.929 --> 1252.71
in his mind he's not listening and then

1249.169 --> 1254.99
lies to the person that's there lies to

1252.71 --> 1256.82
them and says oh yeah I'm gonna say that

1254.99 --> 1259.039
he was four meters above sea level

1256.82 --> 1262.1299999999999
no I was four feet above sea level

1259.039 --> 1263.39
proved on the video Quran yeah he does

1262.13 --> 1266.24
he doesn't listen

1263.39 --> 1268.8200000000002
the last part of my hangout yesterday

1266.24 --> 1271.64
you could clearly see it I was literally

1268.82 --> 1273.76
like literally trying to look in his

1271.64 --> 1277.22
eyes like look at me listen to me

1273.76 --> 1279.52
literally do this if you deviate I will

1277.22 --> 1282.3500000000001
kick you and what does he do

1279.52 --> 1284.72
like can I talk now can I talk yes

1282.35 --> 1287.9289999999999
what'd he do it does he starts out with

1284.72 --> 1291.77
a metaphor okay well bang there you go

1287.929 --> 1294.169
he just doesn't listen he's in his mind

1291.77 --> 1296.15
he's waiting it is kind of like the

1294.169 --> 1298.7
rumpus mode effect where he's just no

1296.15 --> 1301.669
longer listening just waiting to

1298.7 --> 1303.8300000000002
continue the tape in his mind that he

1301.669 --> 1307.0900000000001
constructed on how he's gonna respond

1303.83 --> 1311.33
he's just not listening anymore so

1307.09 --> 1312.83
that's what conspiracy cab does so if

1311.33 --> 1313.97
somebody seems to say that I haven't

1312.83 --> 1316.37
sinned the end of the video correct I

1313.97 --> 1318.83
haven't have watched the first 45

1316.37 --> 1320.3899999999999
minutes or so and that's all I needed to

1318.83 --> 1323.96
really get to because once I got to that

1320.39 --> 1325.429
point I was exasperated by firstly the

1323.96 --> 1328.039
panelists that they brought in who

1325.429 --> 1332.0300000000002
wasn't basically an eagle did arguing

1328.039 --> 1333.71
for the flat earth and secondly the lies

1332.03 --> 1336.799
that were coming out of conspiracy caps

1333.71 --> 1339.65
to try and corner somebody that didn't

1336.799 --> 1341.12
have a the faintest idea how to combat

1339.65 --> 1343.22
that because he's not being given the

1341.12 --> 1346.4289999999999
correct information we've been fed lies

1343.22 --> 1348.71
about an observation and then asked to

1346.429 --> 1351.3200000000002
come up off the top of his head with an

1348.71 --> 1353.15
answer for it when obviously the

1351.32 --> 1356.24
information he was getting was incorrect

1353.15 --> 1357.919
so it was a basically was a [ __ ] show it

1356.24 --> 1359.75
was the guy who sailed to fail and it

1357.919 --> 1362.0
says in here that says that somebody

1359.75 --> 1363.679
reckons that he was a pole run to you

1362.0 --> 1366.5
miss Blair Carroll admitted admitted

1363.679 --> 1372.02
being a pole whatever that is what's

1366.5 --> 1375.85
allowed a Jose awning guys with well

1372.02 --> 1375.85
good you know a PO is peoe

1376.399 --> 1383.029
I heard oh he's like like a troll some

1381.409 --> 1385.0900000000001
type of troll like you don't believe

1383.029 --> 1387.98
something but you push it either way

1385.09 --> 1391.73
excited in an exaggerated way it's a

1387.98 --> 1395.419
troll shield oh hang on there we go so

1391.73 --> 1398.059
Shaun Bookfest says that this guy this

1395.419 --> 1400.1290000000001
kr oh that came in he admitted he was

1398.059 --> 1401.389
trolling you buddy twerp grunting

1400.129 --> 1405.59
clatters I don't know whether that was

1401.389 --> 1407.539
about CRO or conspiracy cat sport if

1405.59 --> 1409.249
that's the case there must even that's

1407.539 --> 1412.07
even worse if they've done an entire

1409.249 --> 1415.429
show bringing in somebody that's it's

1412.07 --> 1417.95
basically gone in there to to pose as a

1415.429 --> 1420.499
flat earther so that they can get

1417.95 --> 1422.3890000000001
completely owned that's really bad

1420.499 --> 1423.95
because no flat earther is gonna debate

1422.389 --> 1427.9699999999998
conspiracy cows because he's such a

1423.95 --> 1430.759
lying bastard well I did I know and you

1427.97 --> 1432.98
didn't he told you not to debate him no

1430.759 --> 1434.84
you did [ __ ] right I did

1432.98 --> 1435.98
I said don't debate him I said you'll

1434.84 --> 1437.36
never get anywhere with him and you'll

1435.98 --> 1440.539
just be using it for sound bites and

1437.36 --> 1443.899
clips don't agree sunlights he like he

1440.539 --> 1447.679
was yeah driveling pure [ __ ] and I even

1443.899 --> 1451.4189999999999
told him in Skype like yeah if you think

1447.679 --> 1455.24
your fairy tale responses are actually

1451.419 --> 1457.249
valuable information that is useful then

1455.24 --> 1459.049
good luck spreading them out there you

1457.249 --> 1460.49
know your might your fare your science

1459.049 --> 1463.22
fiction fairy tale might become

1460.49 --> 1467.11
relatively popular doesn't make it

1463.22 --> 1471.19
relevant or right in any way though so

1467.11 --> 1474.619
yeah good luck with with your scientism

1471.19 --> 1477.309
fairy tale corner over there this is

1474.619 --> 1477.309
ridiculous

1477.67 --> 1482.02
so Jose what can we do for you mate

1484.42 --> 1492.0500000000002
you're a mute sorry I'll be I'll be in

1487.19 --> 1495.8600000000001
in a minute okay yeah so yeah I just

1492.05 --> 1497.36
couldn't not address the lies that come

1495.86 --> 1500.99
out of his mouth I mean I'll give you an

1497.36 --> 1503.12
example you know I came on your show a

1500.99 --> 1504.41
few days ago and we were talking about

1503.12 --> 1506.3
conspiracy catchers actually in the

1504.41 --> 1508.3100000000002
sideshow and I got everybody to shut up

1506.3 --> 1510.83
whilst I made a statement and I

1508.31 --> 1513.1399999999999
basically was talking about if he puts a

1510.83 --> 1515.09
hundred dollars so a hundred pound into

1513.14 --> 1518.99
my patreon account I will consider

1515.09 --> 1521.09
debating him if I don't choose to debate

1518.99 --> 1524.21
him then I will give that money to

1521.09 --> 1526.3999999999999
charity right you heard me say that yeah

1524.21 --> 1529.7
yeah yeah and I made a point of saying

1526.4 --> 1533.18
that in the chat to him and there you

1529.7 --> 1534.6200000000001
know reiterated in fact very point so

1533.18 --> 1538.91
that it was actually captured on on

1534.62 --> 1541.7299999999998
video at the time and I think either it

1538.91 --> 1543.8000000000002
might have been the following day I've

1541.73 --> 1546.56
gotten a Twitter out of the blue from

1543.8 --> 1550.6399999999999
conspiracy counts and this is what he

1546.56 --> 1552.1399999999999
says he says given that you said you

1550.64 --> 1555.7700000000002
would take me up on my offer

1552.14 --> 1557.93
for you to debate me for charity out at

1555.77 --> 1560.09
the non-sequitur show have offered me a

1557.93 --> 1563.75
spot this Saturday you wouldn't go back

1560.09 --> 1566.3
on your word would you let's do it now

1563.75 --> 1572.9
that wasn't what was said that isn't

1566.3 --> 1576.25
what I said right yeah it was you know

1572.9 --> 1579.5600000000002
those teams what I actually said was

1576.25 --> 1582.32
when you see her but it okay here we go

1579.56 --> 1584.78
I've got Baldy cats put a hundred pound

1582.32 --> 1587.45
in my patreon I'll consider your offer

1584.78 --> 1590.0
if I choose to debate I will

1587.45 --> 1593.21
if not I'll donate it to charity deal

1590.0 --> 1594.8
yeah come on big all the screenshot of

1593.21 --> 1596.69
that so I wanted him to screenshot that

1594.8 --> 1598.9099999999999
so you'd have it as evidence but I knew

1596.69 --> 1601.1000000000001
he was gonna twist it I actually knew it

1598.91 --> 1602.69
even said on your your hangout so I'm

1601.1 --> 1604.58
having to state this now because I know

1602.69 --> 1606.98
conspiracy cat is going to twist what

1604.58 --> 1608.75
I've actually said this is exactly what

1606.98 --> 1610.669
I came out with given that you said you

1608.75 --> 1613.309
would take me up on my offer now

1610.669 --> 1615.3500000000001
didn't say that for you to debate me for

1613.309 --> 1618.559
charity so essentially he's making it

1615.35 --> 1619.82
out that I'm not going to do it for

1618.559 --> 1622.6689999999999
charity so I'll charity is being

1619.82 --> 1624.799
affected with this you wouldn't go back

1622.669 --> 1627.71
on your words so essentially he's saying

1624.799 --> 1630.2
that my honor and integrity is on the

1627.71 --> 1631.73
line here that I had obviously said that

1630.2 --> 1632.3300000000002
I was going to debate him which was not

1631.73 --> 1633.8890000000001
the case

1632.33 --> 1636.6789999999999
I didn't say that's all I was very clear

1633.889 --> 1637.85
with Wasser and this is what pops up on

1636.679 --> 1639.47
my Twitter feed so we had a bit of

1637.85 --> 1641.4089999999999
back-and-forth we had a few other people

1639.47 --> 1643.909
join in

1641.409 --> 1645.169
for instance Miles Davis jumped in on

1643.909 --> 1647.23
the conversation you know it was a bit

1645.169 --> 1651.019
of a [ __ ] first I had to in the end

1647.23 --> 1654.6490000000001
block him because they were just lying

1651.019 --> 1656.059
pieces of [ __ ] basically and that's why

1654.649 --> 1657.83
I said I said what you can't debate

1656.059 --> 1659.539
these guys they're just there for sound

1657.83 --> 1662.96
bites are there for content their

1659.539 --> 1665.389
content relies on our content you know

1662.96 --> 1666.859
they don't have content without us so

1665.389 --> 1668.299
they have to provoke they have to lie

1666.859 --> 1670.269
they have to try and engage you in

1668.299 --> 1672.83
conversation they have to twist things

1670.269 --> 1675.739
and it's all designed for them to get

1672.83 --> 1677.33
content to make them relevant right so

1675.739 --> 1679.249
when they've actually deliberately lying

1677.33 --> 1683.269
that's where the things trigger me I

1679.249 --> 1689.809
don't like people that like yeah I get

1683.269 --> 1691.94
it I get it I I don't have a lot of

1689.809 --> 1694.749
trouble because I can just very easily

1691.94 --> 1698.3590000000002
point out the light in a very quick way

1694.749 --> 1700.82
so I can dispel moist effects the

1698.359 --> 1703.369
pollution that lies tend to cause but

1700.82 --> 1707.359
what I can't stand is when people don't

1703.369 --> 1711.619
answer the question that is something I

1707.359 --> 1714.97
get very infuriated over like get me in

1711.619 --> 1720.259
a in a choking mode like answer the damn

1714.97 --> 1722.299
question asked as demanded and don't a

1720.259 --> 1724.85
red herring it and yeah when people

1722.299 --> 1726.379
continually do that yeah then I get sick

1724.85 --> 1729.56
of it but yeah try to find somebody

1726.379 --> 1732.08
among us that doesn't get sick of that

1729.56 --> 1735.86
well essentially you've just given you a

1732.08 --> 1737.36
brief rundown of some of the things that

1735.86 --> 1739.3999999999999
I've encountered with him recently so

1737.36 --> 1741.05
I'm actually as I say I'm in the process

1739.4 --> 1744.98
of making a video that will be out today

1741.05 --> 1747.8
dealing specifically with his lies and

1744.98 --> 1750.02
basically showing to the world what a

1747.8 --> 1753.1699999999998
lying deceiving a little tol rocky

1750.02 --> 1756.08
actually is people need to be aware of

1753.17 --> 1758.15
this because on his channel he comes out

1756.08 --> 1760.1
one particular way yet in reality is

1758.15 --> 1764.63
completely different he's not honest

1760.1 --> 1768.6499999999999
he's not in this to the debate he's in

1764.63 --> 1770.45
it for clicks and well if using clicks

1768.65 --> 1773.21
that's what he's in it for using quick

1770.45 --> 1775.55
he's not in it for the truth no these

1773.21 --> 1778.67
are so predatory he's here to destroy

1775.55 --> 1782.56
people really yes well you know I'm not

1778.67 --> 1787.19
gonna stand by and let him get away with

1782.56 --> 1789.59
using my work with false representations

1787.19 --> 1791.45
of the actual day to involved in it my

1789.59 --> 1793.73
channel is about being honest with the

1791.45 --> 1796.7
data if people have been used my condom

1793.73 --> 1799.55
in that respect they need to be talking

1796.7 --> 1800.96
what the actual data is they don't need

1799.55 --> 1802.22
to be lying about the data it's they're

1800.96 --> 1803.27
gonna weigh about the data I'm gonna

1802.22 --> 1806.24
take offense to that

1803.27 --> 1808.94
yeah because at the end of the day this

1806.24 --> 1811.25
misrepresentation and light now if he's

1808.94 --> 1813.47
actually out for the truth if he's here

1811.25 --> 1816.26
to debate and here for the truth he

1813.47 --> 1819.47
would be looking at this with a critical

1816.26 --> 1822.58
eye he would look at it with all the

1819.47 --> 1826.25
data involved and he would formulate

1822.58 --> 1827.75
some kind of thing from that he would he

1826.25 --> 1829.04
would he would get to a point he'd have

1827.75 --> 1830.81
an answer he'd have the questions he'd

1829.04 --> 1832.67
have the answers but if he's all if he's

1830.81 --> 1835.82
gonna line up for skate and twist things

1832.67 --> 1838.97
he isn't it that shows how close-minded

1835.82 --> 1841.4299999999998
he is no you know he's not evolving he's

1838.97 --> 1845.81
not solving the actual problems just

1841.43 --> 1848.8700000000001
evading into unrelated territory to try

1845.81 --> 1850.87
and muck up the works that's literally

1848.87 --> 1854.59
what he does that's what he did in in

1850.87 --> 1857.139
in our hangout yesterday just an up the

1854.59 --> 1859.779
same thing it's obviously not related to

1857.139 --> 1861.85
trail let's see this kind of work so

1859.779 --> 1864.7
that should kind of work completely

1861.85 --> 1868.1789999999999
nonsense and I'll just say something

1864.7 --> 1871.299
else as well it's the work I do is what

1868.179 --> 1874.45
I would call the dirty truth and what I

1871.299 --> 1877.179
mean by that is I get I have to go into

1874.45 --> 1879.3990000000001
their into their world their world is

1877.179 --> 1882.46
the inferior Mirage in their world is

1879.399 --> 1886.059
blockage and that's an uncomfortable

1882.46 --> 1887.6190000000001
truth for the globe and for some flat

1886.059 --> 1890.769
earth is in a respect and it's these

1887.619 --> 1893.649
dirty truth so I have to present their

1890.769 --> 1896.07
arguments and say why their argument is

1893.649 --> 1900.7589999999998
incorrect why the blockage that they see

1896.07 --> 1902.46
isn't curvature so is my research is

1900.759 --> 1905.32
dirty research so if they're ever gonna

1902.46 --> 1907.57
take anybody's work and misrepresent it

1905.32 --> 1910.389
then I'm the ideal target for that

1907.57 --> 1915.49
because you can't go to Sandra coolpix

1910.389 --> 1918.129
videos and say there's globe proof in

1915.49 --> 1920.559
them because you know she probably goes

1918.129 --> 1923.83
out and she films maybe every day and

1920.559 --> 1925.72
maybe she sees blockage but she doesn't

1923.83 --> 1928.21
want that on her channel she wants all

1925.72 --> 1930.009
the pretty stuff well anybody can go out

1928.21 --> 1932.919
in the film priest off 24 hours a day

1930.009 --> 1935.559
you know I'm it's good but it's showing

1932.919 --> 1937.96
the dirty side of the argument which

1935.559 --> 1940.029
triggers a lot of people and makes

1937.96 --> 1943.33
people represent misrepresent the work

1940.029 --> 1944.889
that I do and so I am a target you know

1943.33 --> 1946.84
there's a cuz I'm on the front line and

1944.889 --> 1949.2099999999998
I'm I'm tackling them head-on with their

1946.84 --> 1951.1589999999999
blockage claims you know that claim I

1949.21 --> 1952.8690000000001
appreciate you appreciate you for that

1951.159 --> 1955.029
grunty because that's kind of my path

1952.869 --> 1957.309
that's what I decided to do to go down

1955.029 --> 1960.159
and area and get the the [ __ ] that

1957.309 --> 1962.61
they don't like to present and show so

1960.159 --> 1965.95
I'm kind of taking the same Pat just

1962.61 --> 1968.35
just doing different heights with eating

1965.95 --> 1970.6000000000001
same observations and boats and little

1968.35 --> 1973.9599999999998
lands and all that all that stuff that

1970.6 --> 1976.2099999999998
many people don't do a lot anymore so

1973.96 --> 1978.429
yeah I support you with that just keep

1976.21 --> 1984.1000000000001
doing it man because I'm following you

1978.429 --> 1987.13
very close yeah the yeah

1984.1 --> 1988.6299999999999
so so yeah so we are a target I'm sure

1987.13 --> 1990.46
you'll become a target I'm sure people

1988.63 --> 1993.0100000000002
start using your videos and proof of

1990.46 --> 1995.14
curve you know because they show

1993.01 --> 1996.94
blockage you know that's what they will

1995.14 --> 1999.16
do they will set any blockage is

1996.94 --> 2000.96
curvature in their mind so it's getting

1999.16 --> 2002.91
through that [ __ ] and narrative I

2000.96 --> 2005.88
already get in the comment section of

2002.91 --> 2008.3400000000001
you yeah and it's like most of my videos

2005.88 --> 2009.69
are 5050 with likes and dislikes you

2008.34 --> 2012.72
know but you know it's just the way it

2009.69 --> 2014.64
is it's a lot of people on the flatter

2012.72 --> 2016.53
side you know perhaps don't appreciate

2014.64 --> 2018.2700000000002
the work I'm doing as well because at

2016.53 --> 2019.799
the time when I first started doing it

2018.27 --> 2023.789
we have people like the limitless

2019.799 --> 2025.53
channel awake Souls and others you know

2023.789 --> 2028.23
coming on and saying that it's

2025.53 --> 2029.6399999999999
fraudulent it's fake it's CGI you can't

2028.23 --> 2032.19
be showing cook why are you showing

2029.64 --> 2034.8600000000001
curve because the comments Roessler will

2032.19 --> 2037.26
you please never forgot about him please

2034.86 --> 2040.3799999999999
they can't promise best they can't

2037.26 --> 2042.809
process that you can look at blockage

2040.38 --> 2045.1200000000001
but it doesn't have to be proof of

2042.809 --> 2047.4289999999999
curvature you know and that's the

2045.12 --> 2049.2599999999998
difference where is I bet I bet in every

2047.429 --> 2053.399
single video you get comments from like

2049.26 --> 2054.869
the characters like they outpace and you

2053.399 --> 2057.72
know on the Miles Davis are more than

2054.869 --> 2059.2200000000003
people right yeah yeah because I'm

2057.72 --> 2061.35
getting I'm starting to get their

2059.22 --> 2063.419
messages to they're coming in my comment

2061.35 --> 2064.919
section later by later not as much as

2063.419 --> 2067.5
you you're getting a hundred percent

2064.919 --> 2069.72
their messages I'm already getting by 50

2067.5 --> 2071.25
percent you know so yeah they're they're

2069.72 --> 2075.54
sneaking in little by little in my

2071.25 --> 2078.389
videos yeah and so yeah so tackling

2075.54 --> 2079.619
these claims is what we need to do I'm

2078.389 --> 2080.909
glad that you've jumped on it as well

2079.619 --> 2082.77
Jose and I hope a few other

2080.909 --> 2085.26
flat-earthers do it this year as well

2082.77 --> 2087.179
you know last year was basically the

2085.26 --> 2090.8990000000003
first time as far as I can recall that a

2087.179 --> 2093.27
flier that did stuff like this so I may

2090.899 --> 2095.129
have led the way in some respects and if

2093.27 --> 2097.56
all the people take up that baton - we

2095.129 --> 2099.9
don't get scared of blockage anymore you

2097.56 --> 2102.119
know we can't just turn our eyes and

2099.9 --> 2104.64
avert our eyes from looking at blockage

2102.119 --> 2108.33
because blockage it does exist or this

2104.64 --> 2109.74
what the blockage is so just sticking

2108.33 --> 2111.6
our head in the sand and saying we can

2109.74 --> 2112.9799999999996
always bring the belt back you know it

2111.6 --> 2114.75
will always come back it doesn't matter

2112.98 --> 2115.95
how far away the boat Gold's we can just

2114.75 --> 2117.119
get the camera out and we'll just zoom

2115.95 --> 2117.5699999999997
in and the boat will be there well

2117.119 --> 2120.27
that's just

2117.57 --> 2124.29
nonsense isn't that is just nonsense

2120.27 --> 2126.69
yeah you know that's absolute that and I

2124.29 --> 2129.75
can understand the globe exasperation

2126.69 --> 2131.76
with that claim because you know that I

2129.75 --> 2134.49
agree with them that is it's nonsense

2131.76 --> 2138.0
it's a nonsense claim because there it's

2134.49 --> 2140.22
the the obstruction is only a figment of

2138.0 --> 2143.28
what is required for an actual do

2140.22 --> 2147.1499999999996
geometrical curve I said so many times

2143.28 --> 2151.25
like no matter the angle of approach but

2147.15 --> 2155.61
intended there is no cumulative drop

2151.25 --> 2159.18
there isn't there is just this yeah the

2155.61 --> 2161.19
optical slanty apparent slant and from

2159.18 --> 2163.71
there on if the conditions are right you

2161.19 --> 2166.38
can see incredibly far and that is not

2163.71 --> 2169.07
consistent with geometrical curve no

2166.38 --> 2171.51
matter how you approach it you can't

2169.07 --> 2175.44
compare it you can't justify it

2171.51 --> 2179.07
the lack of exponential drop you can't

2175.44 --> 2181.4700000000003
justify this and there is no sign of it

2179.07 --> 2183.9300000000003
the only time you can see even suggest

2181.47 --> 2185.8199999999997
that to be present is when everything is

2183.93 --> 2187.68
so miss you just simply just can't see

2185.82 --> 2190.1400000000003
that far yeah

2187.68 --> 2192.4199999999996
so it's ridiculous I mean don't get me

2190.14 --> 2195.2999999999997
wrong I've filmed a boat at 28 miles

2192.42 --> 2197.1
away from an elevation of about 20 feet

2195.3 --> 2200.67
above sea level I was with Antony Reilly

2197.1 --> 2203.4
down at same B's and we filmed this boat

2200.67 --> 2205.7400000000002
I am was able to triangulate which fold

2203.4 --> 2207.27
it was we've got these name got his data

2205.74 --> 2210.3599999999997
as to where it was that particular time

2207.27 --> 2211.74
28 miles away there was there or seeing

2210.36 --> 2215.7000000000003
it that is ridiculous

2211.74 --> 2216.9599999999996
yeah I mean it was distorted you know

2215.7 --> 2219.12
you would expect it if he started

2216.96 --> 2221.46
distorted but it was obvious what it was

2219.12 --> 2222.93
he could see it we thought it was a

2221.46 --> 2224.82
pirate boat and then when I actually got

2222.93 --> 2226.74
back and looked at it on the big screen

2224.82 --> 2229.71
you could identify different things on

2226.74 --> 2232.83
the boat which was able to categorically

2229.71 --> 2234.33
prove which bold it was and what I him I

2232.83 --> 2236.88
would imagine that that was the limit of

2234.33 --> 2238.62
about as far as we can see bolts any

2236.88 --> 2240.51
further you know if it had got another

2238.62 --> 2242.7
couple of miles perhaps it really would

2240.51 --> 2245.0400000000004
have been just lost into the background

2242.7 --> 2246.99
it would have just blended away you know

2245.04 --> 2248.97
what to see it from 28 miles just

2246.99 --> 2252.529
stunning I mean what's the curve Kouts

2248.97 --> 2254.52
on that probably four hundred feet or so

2252.529 --> 2258.24
yeah and don't get me wrong there are

2254.52 --> 2261.119
some there are some stuff that myself I

2258.24 --> 2263.6699999999996
record and yourself that there they are

2261.119 --> 2265.319
a little bit more head scratchers which

2263.67 --> 2268.02
they need a little more elaborate

2265.319 --> 2271.17
explanation than just a the regular

2268.02 --> 2274.079
stuff you know but how about the ballers

2271.17 --> 2276.839
you know where they have to - including

2274.079 --> 2278.819
the equations freakin luminol Holograms

2276.839 --> 2280.2889999999998
[ __ ] you know you know whatever

2278.819 --> 2282.869
doesn't add up to them

2280.289 --> 2286.2000000000003
that's the magic that I don't agree with

2282.869 --> 2288.299
you know looming really [ __ ] I'm not

2286.2 --> 2290.0099999999998
seeing it because my eyes is curving

2288.299 --> 2293.18
around the curve so that's why I see it

2290.01 --> 2297.5690000000004
I call [ __ ] to that explanation man

2293.18 --> 2300.5589999999997
that it is it doesn't make any sense

2297.569 --> 2303.15
that it is that it would be looming

2300.559 --> 2305.01
because you could prove it if it was

2303.15 --> 2309.529
looming if it was looming then that

2305.01 --> 2313.0490000000004
actual location would be thin midair so

2309.529 --> 2315.24
you could prove it well yeah I mean I'm

2313.049 --> 2316.529
starting to prove that with the stuff

2315.24 --> 2318.24
that I'm doing from barrow-in-furness

2316.529 --> 2321.029
and I did say I would start looking into

2318.24 --> 2323.25
it you can check on previous videos that

2321.029 --> 2325.77
I've shot from the same position there's

2323.25 --> 2329.46
a post that's in the water it's like a

2325.77 --> 2331.77
navigational post it's not a buoy it's

2329.46 --> 2334.41
an actual physical post that's in the

2331.77 --> 2336.5099999999998
sand but it's also you know too far out

2334.41 --> 2339.299
and it's in the water as well so it

2336.51 --> 2341.1600000000003
never moves it's stationary and I

2339.299 --> 2344.4
thought from the same location off the

2341.16 --> 2346.0789999999997
same railings and I look at the same

2344.4 --> 2347.46
buildings behind now if there was any

2346.079 --> 2350.46
looming going on there would be a

2347.46 --> 2352.309
difference between the post in the

2350.46 --> 2354.45
foreground which is only four miles away

2352.309 --> 2357.329
and the building's a barrel which is

2354.45 --> 2358.799
some 18 miles you know from my position

2357.329 --> 2360.9900000000002
so we've got a post at four miles

2358.799 --> 2363.089
building 280 miles if there's any

2360.99 --> 2365.16
looming going on and those buildings

2363.089 --> 2366.569
were supposed to be ballooned then we

2365.16 --> 2368.7599999999998
would see a relative difference between

2366.569 --> 2370.5
the post and the foreground and the

2368.76 --> 2373.079
buildings in the background and I never

2370.5 --> 2376.44
see them so on days when we've had the

2373.079 --> 2379.289
massive inferior Mirage and on days when

2376.44 --> 2380.91
we've had clear as clear as a bell those

2379.289 --> 2384.69
buildings have always been in the same

2380.91 --> 2387.66
position relative to the post so in my

2384.69 --> 2390.349
that is clear proof that there wasn't a

2387.66 --> 2393.359
looming going on in in this particular

2390.349 --> 2395.1600000000003
location which then goes to prove that

2393.359 --> 2396.42
when we have this massive inferior

2395.16 --> 2398.3999999999996
Mirage and we was looking to the

2396.42 --> 2400.5
left-hand side of Barrow and we saw the

2398.4 --> 2402.48
sand dunes that were basically floaty

2400.5 --> 2405.21
lung and we had the inferior Mirage

2402.48 --> 2407.73
underneath the the land itself and it

2405.21 --> 2409.53
seemed that the land was being lewd yeah

2407.73 --> 2412.29
right in the past they would call this

2409.53 --> 2414.5690000000004
looming right but yeah when your pants

2412.29 --> 2416.4
are there right and the buildings are

2414.569 --> 2418.95
still in their relative position is

2416.4 --> 2424.349
regards to the post that proves it

2418.95 --> 2426.569
wasn't being loomed or looming going on

2424.349 --> 2428.4300000000003
but they don't even address the

2426.569 --> 2430.77
possibility and the necessity of that

2428.43 --> 2434.49
even though I've run it up over a year

2430.77 --> 2436.109
ago ballers fractal looming it's your

2434.49 --> 2438.839
only hope

2436.109 --> 2442.17
work it out get the model thing right

2438.839 --> 2444.93
with the land illusion you need to fix

2442.17 --> 2447.15
it to fix it in your head so you can

2444.93 --> 2450.1189999999997
never get out of that ball in your mind

2447.15 --> 2453.05
it's gonna imprison you forever so get

2450.119 --> 2457.1400000000003
working on it keep building that prison

2453.05 --> 2460.5600000000004
idiots with this refraction band what

2457.14 --> 2462.99
happens is in the distance the horizon

2460.56 --> 2465.359
appears to go a little higher a little

2462.99 --> 2469.0789999999997
lower depends on how much mirroring

2465.359 --> 2472.8289999999997
effect is going on because then the band

2469.079 --> 2476.76
is gonna disappear it's gonna make okay

2472.829 --> 2479.13
it appears to disappear certain part of

2476.76 --> 2480.8390000000004
the landscape in the lower part but then

2479.13 --> 2484.349
the mirroring happens so the horizon

2480.839 --> 2485.64
changes the apparent position I mean I

2484.349 --> 2488.849
don't know exactly how to explain it but

2485.64 --> 2490.65
that's what it is you know so looming

2488.849 --> 2493.1400000000003
[ __ ] because if you measured a day

2490.65 --> 2494.79
at top of the structures the buildings

2493.14 --> 2497.339
or whatever they stay in the same

2494.79 --> 2498.75
relative position but then the bottom is

2497.339 --> 2500.04
gonna change because it's gonna be

2498.75 --> 2502.8
mirror underneath so you're gonna see

2500.04 --> 2505.38
more but not but it's gonna be

2502.8 --> 2507.569
underneath itself you know and then it's

2505.38 --> 2509.25
gonna be the horizon a little lower so

2507.569 --> 2511.68
it's gonna appear to be hovering on

2509.25 --> 2513.99
whatever the sci-fi effects [ __ ]

2511.68 --> 2516.089
that we see well yeah I mean if you

2513.99 --> 2518.609
imagine when Anthony Reilly first

2516.089 --> 2520.8289999999997
brought out the the floaty laughter the

2518.609 --> 2522.359
northern part of the isle of man so he's

2520.829 --> 2524.3390000000004
on his stomach and he's looking at the

2522.359 --> 2526.049
Isle of Man from 30 miles away off the

2524.339 --> 2528.45
beach right he's only stomach with the

2526.049 --> 2530.849
camera p900 out and he sees the floats

2528.45 --> 2532.259
heal and to the right now the gland was

2530.849 --> 2535.17
were playing in that that was being

2532.259 --> 2538.799
loomed up that was right away a hold on

2535.17 --> 2540.869
Randy could you possibly well present

2538.799 --> 2543.329
the images instead of just talking about

2540.869 --> 2545.6400000000003
them that would make me better if if

2543.329 --> 2548.2200000000003
it's convenient yeah hang on

2545.64 --> 2551.8799999999997
give me five minutes to find everything

2548.22 --> 2553.769
oh [ __ ] five minute okay well I'll have

2551.88 --> 2555.509
to find it for him I've don't literally

2553.769 --> 2561.299
have them to have right now so just give

2555.509 --> 2564.059
me a sec don't worry about it so yes so

2561.299 --> 2566.91
when he was doing this off the beach if

2564.059 --> 2569.309
you imagine him he seen this land and he

2566.91 --> 2571.3489999999997
used to he termed it floaty land and the

2569.309 --> 2573.15
globus jumped on it oh there that's

2571.349 --> 2576.15
floating land and it's actually looming

2573.15 --> 2578.4300000000003
yeah so once you've disproved that

2576.15 --> 2580.65
effect and you've taken it out of there

2578.43 --> 2584.64
a store they no longer have looming has

2580.65 --> 2588.329
been an actual phenomena that really

2584.64 --> 2590.609
does happen then we can start to explain

2588.329 --> 2592.829
all this stuff and we can say well

2590.609 --> 2594.72
actually I don't he was viewing then he

2592.829 --> 2597.119
was actually just viewing the northern

2594.72 --> 2599.4889999999996
part of the Isle of Man and he had an

2597.119 --> 2601.849
inferior Mirage underneath it which was

2599.489 --> 2608.759
reflecting the sky making it look floaty

2601.849 --> 2611.13
you know yeah and it had this squashing

2608.759 --> 2613.049
effect because he was really really low

2611.13 --> 2615.2690000000002
to the ground so yeah I know it was

2613.049 --> 2617.45
there was a glorious that the word he

2615.269 --> 2620.43
used it is glorious

2617.45 --> 2623.7889999999998
it's a huge youth messy note for you

2620.43 --> 2627.3289999999997
guys no no no so when you click YouTube

2623.789 --> 2629.789
and you trying to look at some just

2627.329 --> 2632.039
clicking YouTube you're not getting half

2629.789 --> 2634.079
of the thumbnails cut off on all the

2632.039 --> 2634.529
videos that you trying to work no oh

2634.079 --> 2640.259
really

2634.529 --> 2641.339
let me check out oh I got 898

2640.259 --> 2644.67
subscribers by

2641.339 --> 2648.71
we please subscribe to my channel I get

2644.67 --> 2650.91
to that thousand ah let me see

2648.71 --> 2653.67
it's just finished me it's been messing

2650.91 --> 2656.8799999999997
up all day for me so I'm just wondered

2653.67 --> 2662.069
if it's my PC or not I don't see any

2656.88 --> 2664.829
thumbnail issues okay it could be that

2662.069 --> 2669.21
your video memory is having some

2664.829 --> 2671.849
problems hey do you have a a PC or a

2669.21 --> 2676.739
laptop I have a PC but I've run out of

2671.849 --> 2679.349
memory essentially so how long ago did

2676.739 --> 2686.609
you clean out the dust out of your

2679.349 --> 2689.279
computer well oh yeah cause during the

2686.609 --> 2690.69
winter a lot of dust tends to heap up

2689.279 --> 2696.029
inside your computer

2690.69 --> 2697.739
causing yeah electric interference if

2696.029 --> 2699.42
you clean that is a big chance that

2697.739 --> 2704.759
everything is gonna function just like

2699.42 --> 2710.309
new again so just say okay right if you

2704.759 --> 2713.729
want to pop me on yeah you are so this

2710.309 --> 2715.71
was essentially Antony Reilly's video

2713.729 --> 2718.0789999999997
and what we have here at the you know

2715.71 --> 2720.059
where his cursor is up here we have this

2718.079 --> 2723.96
flow steel arm now he filmed this from

2720.059 --> 2726.119
the beach and as you can see we have

2723.96 --> 2729.089
this lamb this terrain here that matches

2726.119 --> 2731.549
up actually it does match up to the

2729.089 --> 2733.92
northern part of the Isle of Man but you

2731.549 --> 2737.249
also have the sky underneath it that's

2733.92 --> 2739.4990000000003
this inferior Mirage that's repeating

2737.249 --> 2743.0989999999997
the sky down so it's it looks like this

2739.499 --> 2744.749
Lundy's is floating and at the time he

2743.099 --> 2746.4300000000003
called it floating land he was asking

2744.749 --> 2748.589
questions what is this what's going on

2746.43 --> 2752.519
and back back in the day when this was

2748.589 --> 2755.0389999999998
on Nathan's debates people like Jim Hamm

2752.519 --> 2757.799
to come in and they would they would

2755.039 --> 2760.17
claim at this swimming right this is

2757.799 --> 2762.359
this is their play now Antony was a bit

2760.17 --> 2763.89
yeah well no I don't think it was like

2762.359 --> 2765.21
that the weather was really clear and I

2763.89 --> 2766.92
thought for whatever reason it he just

2765.21 --> 2768.299
didn't look like what you're saying that

2766.92 --> 2770.13
it was loomed and then they were they

2768.299 --> 2775.52
were like oh yes well it is looming it's

2770.13 --> 2779.58
well-known phenomena so tackling this

2775.52 --> 2781.44
tackling this type of thing now with the

2779.58 --> 2784.38
information we have now after a

2781.44 --> 2786.36
year-long study down at the beach we can

2784.38 --> 2790.4700000000003
say that no it's not looming what you're

2786.36 --> 2795.1200000000003
actually seeing here is the top part of

2790.47 --> 2796.95
this land here is is real the floaty

2795.12 --> 2799.5
stuff underneath it that looks like lund

2796.95 --> 2801.81
is an inferior Mirage of the lambda ball

2799.5 --> 2803.4
and then beneath that you've got an also

2801.81 --> 2805.41
an inferior Mirage at the sky above it

2803.4 --> 2808.17
so you can put a line right through the

2805.41 --> 2810.0
middle here and that's where we're

2808.17 --> 2812.28
seeing down to now the rest of it is

2810.0 --> 2814.98
blockage so everything the nice here is

2812.28 --> 2817.1400000000003
now blockage it's not actually being

2814.98 --> 2819.03
loomed up it's just blockage caused by

2817.14 --> 2820.94
the inferior Mirage so it's atmospheric

2819.03 --> 2824.19
flow that's what it is

2820.94 --> 2825.69
and we can prove this categorically we

2824.19 --> 2829.68
can prove that things aren't being wound

2825.69 --> 2831.2400000000002
up now so we take one of my last videos

2829.68 --> 2833.2799999999997
that little piece of land and the boat

2831.24 --> 2835.56
was going behind it and you see the

2833.28 --> 2838.77
reflection of the boat underneath that

2835.56 --> 2841.17
little little floating floating land you

2838.77 --> 2844.2
know so if let's say there was a big-ass

2841.17 --> 2846.15
boat going behind that piece of land a

2844.2 --> 2847.68
floating land you probably see the

2846.15 --> 2851.61
reflection underneath in their little

2847.68 --> 2854.0699999999997
blue band underneath the water which is

2851.61 --> 2856.92
a little you know it still need a little

2854.07 --> 2858.81
more exploring and more analysis to

2856.92 --> 2860.9700000000003
explain was really happening because

2858.81 --> 2863.25
they're rich lecture is crazy because

2860.97 --> 2865.14
that should be a solid piece of land is

2863.25 --> 2868.41
just the reflection of the sky from

2865.14 --> 2870.93
above but but yeah it is is it's been

2868.41 --> 2872.85
documented many times and he welcome

2870.93 --> 2875.04
Tina we'll get him documented by myself

2872.85 --> 2877.56
and yourself hopefully others yes yep

2875.04 --> 2879.06
in history is the other thing yeah back

2877.56 --> 2881.46
when with this was all going on the

2879.06 --> 2884.58
question was was it Island or was it the

2881.46 --> 2885.62
Isle of Man and back in the day when

2884.58 --> 2888.66
this was raging

2885.62 --> 2890.49
we had obviously the globe side that

2888.66 --> 2892.44
that proved to be correct that it wasn't

2890.49 --> 2896.79
actually Island we thought it was Island

2892.44 --> 2899.01
so we were wrong but this went on for at

2896.79 --> 2900.33
least a couple of months I would say to

2899.01 --> 2903.48
the point where we conceded that

2900.33 --> 2905.84
actually it wasn't Island it was the

2903.48 --> 2908.7
Isle of Man but throughout that process

2905.84 --> 2911.07
we had things like this floating land

2908.7 --> 2916.68
came up and we got a very clear and

2911.07 --> 2918.2400000000002
concise response from the globe all of

2916.68 --> 2921.48
the globe that one saying that this

2918.24 --> 2923.43
floaty land is looming right so we were

2921.48 --> 2926.099
well aware that this was the position of

2923.43 --> 2929.2799999999997
the globe so whenever we see things like

2926.099 --> 2931.1400000000003
this floaty this floaty that here there

2929.28 --> 2934.38
and everywhere the globe always come

2931.14 --> 2937.14
back to its being a loomed up so it

2934.38 --> 2939.42
should be the other way around even

2937.14 --> 2944.0099999999998
though it was a loss for us we lost

2939.42 --> 2946.56
Island what we gained was there concrete

2944.01 --> 2948.38
narrative that this is looming right so

2946.56 --> 2950.97
now we have that that's their position

2948.38 --> 2955.1400000000003
so dismantling that and taking it away

2950.97 --> 2956.8199999999997
from them is actually a wing so this

2955.14 --> 2959.8199999999997
process over the past year of these

2956.82 --> 2962.88
debates people may see them as being a

2959.82 --> 2965.2200000000003
Bulls evolving our argument and evolving

2962.88 --> 2967.8900000000003
our knowledge of the environment that we

2965.22 --> 2971.1899999999996
live in testing things getting answers

2967.89 --> 2972.72
and this is where it's this is this is

2971.19 --> 2975.48
the process that's led us to where we

2972.72 --> 2978.1499999999996
are right now where we can actually

2975.48 --> 2980.16
address things like this and we can

2978.15 --> 2985.13
explain that all blockages and curvature

2980.16 --> 2987.6299999999997
we can explain it and and they're not

2985.13 --> 2990.75
and they come out because their model is

2987.63 --> 2993.03
set they have to have looming in their

2990.75 --> 2995.7
model they cannot not have looming in

2993.03 --> 2997.71
their model you take looming away you

2995.7 --> 2997.9199999999996
kill their model whereas as simple as

2997.71 --> 3000.98
that

2997.92 --> 3003.5
you take away curvy water that a model

3000.98 --> 3005.0
is screwed well the only reason they

3003.5 --> 3006.77
will then turn around and say that you

3005.0 --> 3010.25
can see further is because of looming so

3006.77 --> 3012.74
essentially destroying looming is was

3010.25 --> 3015.589
also the biggest win for Flat Earth in

3012.74 --> 3021.2599999999998
the past couple years because we've

3015.589 --> 3022.94
destroyed the argument for looming which

3021.26 --> 3024.5890000000004
destroys their model yeah the whole

3022.94 --> 3027.44
[ __ ] thing about looming is it can

3024.589 --> 3030.77
only if something is truly displacing

3027.44 --> 3033.28
looming then it has to be uniform and

3030.77 --> 3037.5099999999998
there can be a mirage

3033.28 --> 3041.21
reflection within the looming effect

3037.51 --> 3044.75
that's preposterous you can't loom a

3041.21 --> 3048.13
mirror basic you remember that

3044.75 --> 3050.869
ridiculous ridiculous thing they they

3048.13 --> 3052.4
somebody did to explain the looming and

3050.869 --> 3054.319
saying like look I can replicate a

3052.4 --> 3056.78
looming and they pull like a piece of

3054.319 --> 3059.66
marrow and they throw some kind of

3056.78 --> 3062.2400000000002
chemical liquid um he brought the little

3059.66 --> 3064.069
caller from behind you know but but

3062.24 --> 3065.839
still the top of the they had like a

3064.069 --> 3067.91
little crayon with callers or something

3065.839 --> 3070.16
and they throw this little chemical and

3067.91 --> 3072.3799999999997
the gas may kind of appear the little

3070.16 --> 3074.6499999999996
bottom a little bit for a second it was

3072.38 --> 3076.94
such such a joke you know that little

3074.65 --> 3082.13
quote-unquote experiment they did to

3076.94 --> 3084.77
prove looming it was nonsense I'm always

3082.13 --> 3087.9700000000003
fascinated by their concepts of trying

3084.77 --> 3090.77
to prove to rest your refraction by

3087.97 --> 3092.8089999999997
looking on some kind of curved surface

3090.77 --> 3097.5099999999998
and then pouring a liquid on it oh look

3092.809 --> 3100.9100000000003
see this is how the lights I love those

3097.51 --> 3103.13
because it is so kooky every time it is

3100.91 --> 3108.41
almost like the Cavendish is set up that

3103.13 --> 3110.599
ridiculous well you can buy your

3108.41 --> 3113.1499999999996
Cavendish experiment you can buy a kit

3110.599 --> 3118.46
for the Cavendish experiment bro that's

3113.15 --> 3120.559
the most ridiculous payment I had a

3118.46 --> 3122.9900000000002
similar type of kit it was called a

3120.559 --> 3128.92
magician's kit for kids

3122.99 --> 3133.0099999999998
bingo you can do a strange trickery to

3128.92 --> 3135.17
me we're doing by that boy sorrows yeah

3133.01 --> 3136.9100000000003
where do I better buy the coming decent

3135.17 --> 3140.27
boys are all like a kid you know

3136.91 --> 3147.569
whatever be careful what you wish for it

3140.27 --> 3151.229
might actually happen the Cavendish kid

3147.569 --> 3153.599
you want to see a really massive

3151.229 --> 3156.479
inferior Mirage I do indeed

3153.599 --> 3159.2690000000002
okay watch this well actually in this

3156.479 --> 3162.239
video what I'm doing here is I'm looking

3159.269 --> 3164.4489999999996
at the moon as well and I'm it's a

3162.239 --> 3167.819
couple of days after the the full moon

3164.449 --> 3168.299
basically said the air clarity is much

3167.819 --> 3170.819
better

3168.299 --> 3172.469
um days after the you know after the

3170.819 --> 3173.88
full moon which is correct I mean you

3172.469 --> 3175.859
can go back here and you can look at the

3173.88 --> 3179.009
the terrain in the distance it looks

3175.859 --> 3180.839
really really clear obviously if I can

3179.009 --> 3182.369
bring some of that all so yeah you can

3180.839 --> 3184.41
see all the crevasses here and

3182.369 --> 3186.299
everything it's just really crisp you

3184.41 --> 3189.299
know you these mountains are some 30

3186.299 --> 3191.849
miles away and they look much nearer you

3189.299 --> 3194.729
don't normally see this this clarity

3191.849 --> 3197.4590000000003
however we have a massive inferior

3194.729 --> 3199.41
Mirage going on on this day and wait

3197.459 --> 3204.1189999999997
till you see the weights you see the

3199.41 --> 3207.0589999999997
blockage that they used to claim was was

3204.119 --> 3209.849
earth curved look at this this is this

3207.059 --> 3212.7290000000003
was one of the wickedest inferior Mirage

3209.849 --> 3215.6090000000004
I actually saw it in this location I

3212.729 --> 3218.009
mean we know that this mountain comes

3215.609 --> 3220.2889999999998
down here and where my cursor is now

3218.009 --> 3222.239
over here we normally see more much more

3220.289 --> 3225.6600000000003
lumps going all the way off to the left

3222.239 --> 3227.549
and where my cursor is right now this

3225.66 --> 3229.799
this center line right through the

3227.549 --> 3231.779
middle that's where the inferior mirages

3229.799 --> 3233.339
happening you can clearly see it on here

3231.779 --> 3235.589
it's like a number three so in the

3233.339 --> 3237.8089999999997
center of the number three is where this

3235.589 --> 3242.369
inferior Mirage runs through the entire

3237.809 --> 3246.239
image the entire video and absolute

3242.369 --> 3248.279
crazy blockage and obviously the camera

3246.239 --> 3251.19
or your own edge can't penetrate through

3248.279 --> 3253.41
this inferior Mirage the inferior Mirage

3251.19 --> 3255.63
actually of both the surface of the

3253.41 --> 3260.009
water it isn't the water itself it isn't

3255.63 --> 3262.9790000000003
the homvee curve it is atmospheric

3260.009 --> 3265.499
blockage and we know this because this

3262.979 --> 3268.979
is the post in the foreground this is

3265.499 --> 3271.589
the post there's a building behind and

3268.979 --> 3274.319
obviously we've got this as a reference

3271.589 --> 3275.7889999999998
point to use against all the videos but

3274.319 --> 3276.569
the inferior Mirage like I said it was

3275.789 --> 3280.079
just crazy

3276.569 --> 3281.3089999999997
on this day and what's it'll go back

3280.079 --> 3284.099
some of the other stuff that was going

3281.309 --> 3285.539
on this lighthouse is probably twice as

3284.099 --> 3289.6400000000003
long as it normally is because it's just

3285.539 --> 3292.079
a complete inferior Mirage of itself and

3289.64 --> 3294.39
yeah so normally when we would be

3292.079 --> 3298.4590000000003
looking in this direction what we would

3294.39 --> 3302.219
see is we would see a bunch of houses

3298.459 --> 3304.109
right by the shoreline in this location

3302.219 --> 3307.2000000000003
where I'm doing the circle now beneath

3304.109 --> 3308.94
that you would see the estuary where the

3307.2 --> 3311.069
bolts come in and the conductor Devin

3308.94 --> 3313.14
should call you know it's not the bolts

3311.069 --> 3314.609
the the bolts come around and they do

3313.14 --> 3316.43
duck but not a definite alcohol that

3314.609 --> 3319.0789999999997
would be where you would have the

3316.43 --> 3320.249
submarines so the submarines could go in

3319.079 --> 3322.8590000000004
there but essentially there's an ash

3320.249 --> 3325.14
tree that you see there and none of its

3322.859 --> 3326.67
seen it's all blocked out in front of

3325.14 --> 3328.65
the ash tree you would have some June

3326.67 --> 3332.16
normal some units in the foreground

3328.65 --> 3335.539
again that's hidden as well so it's all

3332.16 --> 3337.979
blocked out by the inferior Mirage and

3335.539 --> 3343.0190000000002
yeah taking this away from them has been

3337.979 --> 3347.5789999999997
a pleasure I have to admit and and just

3343.019 --> 3350.9689999999996
an excellent example again in yeah I can

3347.579 --> 3353.1600000000003
use an image like this so well to show

3350.969 --> 3355.619
you where the obstacles land starts and

3353.16 --> 3360.5389999999998
what the Mirage in zone is exactly like

3355.619 --> 3362.4300000000003
within the space of all these items you

3360.539 --> 3365.88
can see where it starts and from there

3362.43 --> 3368.3689999999997
on it's like a slice out of sight and it

3365.88 --> 3370.259
moves upwards and it moves downwards and

3368.369 --> 3374.849
everything within that part is just

3370.259 --> 3377.369
reflected I would like to revisit one of

3374.849 --> 3379.38
my old videos I don't know if Randy

3377.369 --> 3381.63
would like to share it if you go to my

3379.38 --> 3384.029
channel he it's posted five months ago

3381.63 --> 3388.559
that was take it's taken with my old

3384.029 --> 3391.559
camera if the title is both disappears

3388.559 --> 3395.1800000000003
in the distance these five months ago

3391.559 --> 3397.949
and the thumbnail is like Yoda Yoda

3395.18 --> 3400.9199999999996
saying you must unlearn what you have

3397.949 --> 3404.13
learned check both disappears in the

3400.92 --> 3406.7090000000003
distance and is ridiculous Mirage and

3404.13 --> 3408.599
then you see the boat as he goes away is

3406.709 --> 3411.049
from really close I catch it right next

3408.599 --> 3413.579
to me and he goes away he starting

3411.049 --> 3414.39
disappeared I starting hovering hovering

3413.579 --> 3417.0
and getting

3414.39 --> 3418.3799999999997
me world is really cool to look at I was

3417.0 --> 3419.13
looking at it yesterday I said man

3418.38 --> 3423.15
that's awesome

3419.13 --> 3427.309
Selenia a boat disappears in the

3423.15 --> 3431.9100000000003
distance is from five months ago here

3427.309 --> 3434.42
yeah you can time and a half maybe and

3431.91 --> 3434.42
just let it play

3437.81 --> 3442.19
all right this is my older camera oh no

3441.77 --> 3445.82
what

3442.19 --> 3447.68
Oh thing yeah they were dolphins very

3445.82 --> 3452.96
active dolphins in those area that

3447.68 --> 3455.96
wasn't flirting go back and watch it

3452.96 --> 3460.16
breach will change the speed on it not

3455.96 --> 3465.68
going to five that's really cool

3460.16 --> 3468.91
there it is look at it yeah it's gonna

3465.68 --> 3468.91
pop out around about here

3472.34 --> 3474.9100000000003
OOP

3474.94 --> 3483.67
how about that very and then he does it

3479.75 --> 3486.53
again as well that's really cool yeah

3483.67 --> 3489.35
yeah check on that we look at the back

3486.53 --> 3492.4100000000003
look at that in the background look at

3489.35 --> 3495.02
that bridge yeah their eyes they're

3492.41 --> 3496.79
mirroring going on and after that maybe

3495.02 --> 3499.67
seven miles away it's not even that far

3496.79 --> 3502.1
you know the globe the globe is used to

3499.67 --> 3504.02
claim that this inferior Mirage this

3502.1 --> 3507.89
this is where the concert the homemade

3504.02 --> 3509.54
the hump is yeah oh yeah yeah and that

3507.89 --> 3511.7599999999998
body's gonna keep going away he's gonna

3509.54 --> 3513.5299999999997
go behind he's gonna go past that bridge

3511.76 --> 3515.84
so what you think it's gonna happen I

3513.53 --> 3517.2200000000003
think it's gonna start to do an inferior

3515.84 --> 3520.61
Mirage of the boat and then it you know

3517.22 --> 3522.7599999999998
start disappearing bottom-up it is

3520.61 --> 3525.8900000000003
reflected on itself and then eventually

3522.76 --> 3528.2000000000003
disappearing reflected on itself then

3525.89 --> 3529.52
maybe you'll see it floating perhaps it

3528.2 --> 3531.02
may meet match start to look like it's

3529.52 --> 3534.08
being loomed and then it will just

3531.02 --> 3537.5
completely vanish that's why I think oh

3534.08 --> 3541.22
yeah cool let's see how long is this

3537.5 --> 3543.95
video it's a few minutes I mean they're

3541.22 --> 3545.6299999999997
in time and a half but but just look at

3543.95 --> 3548.23
it yeah it's cool when the effects start

3545.63 --> 3553.03
to take effect

3548.23 --> 3553.03
now the water is starting to reflect

3554.329 --> 3558.289
so it's practically beyond the optical

3556.489 --> 3560.439
slant which is pretty the foreground

3558.289 --> 3560.4390000000003
here

3570.73 --> 3575.859
it's like that it's already hovering and

3573.579 --> 3579.4900000000002
you don't even look like a boat no more

3575.859 --> 3583.63
yeah the boats are melting it is getting

3579.49 --> 3586.41
off obscured by legging up by the

3583.63 --> 3586.4100000000003
refraction zone

3590.79 --> 3594.79
when the water is really clear not

3593.14 --> 3596.98
altered you know with the waves and

3594.79 --> 3600.49
stuff and I have nothing in the

3596.98 --> 3602.77
background to guide where they were the

3600.49 --> 3605.1699999999996
actual horizon is the they will claim

3602.77 --> 3607.81
that this line apparent horizon will be

3605.17 --> 3610.39
the real horizon when you know it's not

3607.81 --> 3613.71
higher you know oh yeah I mean the real

3610.39 --> 3617.47
horizon could be higher than those trees

3613.71 --> 3619.3
literally you know yeah yeah the further

3617.47 --> 3622.93
he goes away the higher appears to be

3619.3 --> 3625.0600000000004
here yeah but look at that it's all

3622.93 --> 3633.43
distorted now just a little hovering

3625.06 --> 3637.24
thing and debris yeah look at that bendy

3633.43 --> 3644.3999999999996
you know dates times bendy calls

3637.24 --> 3644.3999999999996
I think it's naturally bent by the way

3646.579 --> 3651.569
well those things are like wobbling all

3649.2 --> 3653.46
over the place there it was pretty one

3651.569 --> 3658.109
oh yeah it was pretty warm that day

3653.46 --> 3659.339
right or or not it was yeah it was warm

3658.109 --> 3663.06
now you can see it

3659.339 --> 3664.47
everything's marbling of the heat and if

3663.06 --> 3666.92
I just pause it right here we know that

3664.47 --> 3671.27
the inferior Mirage on the bridge is

3666.92 --> 3674.9700000000003
higher than the boat right now yes

3671.27 --> 3674.97
[Laughter]

3675.74 --> 3682.0789999999997
absolutely yes is a killer as well Oh

3678.619 --> 3685.65
Rufus are wobbling wolf is starting to

3682.079 --> 3688.5890000000004
dance yeah it's like a three-legged look

3685.65 --> 3691.77
at that other boat coming yeah they look

3688.589 --> 3693.39
like sci-fi vehicles crazy stuff yeah

3691.77 --> 3696.15
but listen their mind is proof of

3693.39 --> 3699.2599999999998
curvature you realize that oh yeah yeah

3696.15 --> 3705.4500000000003
it's my proof of a hovering spaceship

3699.26 --> 3712.01
look at that see hovering spaceship come

3705.45 --> 3712.0099999999998
on cool stuff very cool

3714.14 --> 3719.239
so yeah after seeing that reflecting

3716.989 --> 3723.049
back I'd have to say Jose that you are a

3719.239 --> 3731.68
total shield against Flat Earth rights

3723.049 --> 3731.68
perfect sense yeah yeah I don't get it

3731.769 --> 3740.47
but good stuff

3733.599 --> 3740.4700000000003
hey where did house they go what did you

3748.029 --> 3755.539
know I'm gonna kick you Jose yeah

3752.599 --> 3759.8900000000003
awesome footage I loved it it's so good

3755.539 --> 3763.3390000000004
that you can literally see it go into

3759.89 --> 3765.98
that zone from before it where you can

3763.339 --> 3769.599
just see it all and then starting to

3765.98 --> 3773.9
gradually go in that is so amazing

3769.599 --> 3776.21
you can trigger you know it is basically

3773.9 --> 3779.7200000000003
a straight line of sight with some weird

3776.21 --> 3783.41
effects going on but it's really there

3779.72 --> 3785.3289999999997
it's not not there being completely

3783.41 --> 3788.509
reflected or loomed up from another

3785.329 --> 3791.3900000000003
location that is actually outside there

3788.509 --> 3793.849
that's not happening it is really there

3791.39 --> 3799.1299999999997
there's just other weird reflective

3793.849 --> 3801.4990000000003
things going on because unfortunately

3799.13 --> 3804.44
when I got me that one camera it was

3801.499 --> 3806.66
like really summertime and every day I

3804.44 --> 3808.64
was getting this mirroring a figure I

3806.66 --> 3811.339
never get to go in a really clear day

3808.64 --> 3812.8689999999997
and try to see further away even though

3811.339 --> 3815.66
they come and I didn't have enough zoom

3812.869 --> 3819.23
but I never had a really clear day so

3815.66 --> 3821.18
yeah one day yep you want to see what

3819.23 --> 3823.039
barrel looks like without an inferior

3821.18 --> 3825.71
Mirage when you just got a clear line of

3823.039 --> 3827.63
sight of it all right yes okay so you

3825.71 --> 3829.759
saw the video before when we had the

3827.63 --> 3832.309
inferior Mirage of the buildings that's

3829.759 --> 3833.63
talked about the post etc so this is

3832.309 --> 3835.94
just on a clear day so I'm just gonna

3833.63 --> 3837.2000000000003
chord it there for a second before we're

3835.94 --> 3840.349
going to zoom in any further if you

3837.2 --> 3842.45
remember on the last video we got to

3840.349 --> 3844.2490000000003
around about this position and we have

3842.45 --> 3846.23
the inferior Mirage starting we're at

3844.249 --> 3848.27
where the cursor is now we didn't see

3846.23 --> 3851.42
any of this land to the left

3848.27 --> 3852.95
hidden didn't see the ash tree in the

3851.42 --> 3858.23
front here in the foreground wouldn't

3852.95 --> 3859.46
see the buildings so all this land when

3858.23 --> 3862.22
we look into the left that wasn't

3859.46 --> 3866.63
visible all this land that should be

3862.22 --> 3870.109
there just a clearing idea just a clear

3866.63 --> 3874.359
a day it was all hidden by the inferior

3870.109 --> 3877.069
Mirage but this is their claim of

3874.359 --> 3881.15
looming you see though when we presented

3877.069 --> 3885.5
this on on Nathan's more recently they

3881.15 --> 3887.089
were saying this was being loomed up but

3885.5 --> 3888.619
then when you actually look at the

3887.089 --> 3892.339
building in the background compare it

3888.619 --> 3897.619
with the post that kind of knocks that

3892.339 --> 3899.24
assertion out of the park really so yes

3897.619 --> 3900.92
so in their model this is being loomed

3899.24 --> 3902.8089999999997
because we shouldn't see that we

3900.92 --> 3905.03
shouldn't see to where we're seeing on

3902.809 --> 3907.01
this line from this height you know this

3905.03 --> 3908.869
should be about 40 foot of blockage and

3907.01 --> 3916.4
we're essentially seeing down to the

3908.869 --> 3918.079
floor indeed exactly here and yeah so

3916.4 --> 3921.23
this is where we have the inferior

3918.079 --> 3923.119
Mirage going on etc etcetera yeah that's

3921.23 --> 3925.369
all so much really clear Dave and you

3923.119 --> 3927.9700000000003
see down to the beach pretty much you

3925.369 --> 3930.8900000000003
just see it because this is what you see

3927.97 --> 3932.6899999999996
it's a clear a day it's not being loomed

3930.89 --> 3937.22
or there's just a knowing Theory mirage

3932.69 --> 3939.98
going on that's it so is there a pattern

3937.22 --> 3942.8289999999997
to get clearer days you see like a

3939.98 --> 3945.41
couple days after the full moon you kind

3942.829 --> 3947.9300000000003
of seen for the past ten months or so

3945.41 --> 3949.52
it's always been the case that a couple

3947.93 --> 3954.2799999999997
of days after the full moon

3949.52 --> 3954.28
I've been able to see this kind of stuff

3955.839 --> 3960.0789999999997
occasionally we've had the inferior

3958.49 --> 3961.79
Mirage going on which means that you

3960.079 --> 3963.6800000000003
can't actually see very far on the

3961.79 --> 3965.5099999999998
bottom but when you're looking at the

3963.68 --> 3968.54
mountains of terrain in the land higher

3965.51 --> 3970.3390000000004
off above the inferior Mirage it's

3968.54 --> 3973.24
always much clearer rich of the colors a

3970.339 --> 3975.14
crisper everything looks a lot cleaner

3973.24 --> 3977.75
that's the only way I can say it looks

3975.14 --> 3980.089
rich rich in color rich in sharpness

3977.75 --> 3981.04
everything looks good I don't know why

3980.089 --> 3983.34
it happens

3981.04 --> 3986.29
for a couple of days after the full moon

3983.34 --> 3990.04
that's when it seems to be the you know

3986.29 --> 3991.45
for the clearest days doesn't mean that

3990.04 --> 3992.98
you're gonna see the furthest because

3991.45 --> 3994.8399999999997
you might get days where you've got an

3992.98 --> 3997.2400000000002
inferior Mirage going on okay well I can

3994.84 --> 3999.9700000000003
theorize about why that is

3997.24 --> 4002.7299999999996
the full moon there is the most cold

3999.97 --> 4005.8199999999997
light at night so I think that will

4002.73 --> 4010.38
clear out much of the moist in the air

4005.82 --> 4019.8
in that specific period makes sense

4010.38 --> 4022.23
right yeah somehow yeah I mean yeah it's

4019.8 --> 4024.4500000000003
a theory yeah I mean yeah you gotta

4022.23 --> 4026.4
entertain everything yeah it's just pure

4024.45 --> 4028.3799999999997
speculation but I do see kind of a

4026.4 --> 4030.7200000000003
relation like yeah cool cold moon lights

4028.38 --> 4033.87
during the full moon it's gonna be the

4030.72 --> 4035.73
most light and yeah cold light is gonna

4033.87 --> 4040.83
have an effect on water of course so

4035.73 --> 4044.67
maybe it is gonna yeah take away some of

4040.83 --> 4047.04
the water dissolved in the air because

4044.67 --> 4049.56
of the higher temperatures basically and

4047.04 --> 4052.29
force cloud formation and then yeah

4049.56 --> 4056.16
that's gonna eventually settle or fall

4052.29 --> 4059.25
down or whatever I have never recorded

4056.16 --> 4061.71
on a day that the water is cooler than

4059.25 --> 4063.03
the air have you good any of those days

4061.71 --> 4067.62
front you know you check on the

4063.03 --> 4069.7400000000002
temperature of water basis here I think

4067.62 --> 4072.62
this year I am gonna get a few

4069.74 --> 4075.1699999999996
additional things so I'm gonna get a

4072.62 --> 4077.79
couple of thermometers black and

4075.17 --> 4080.16
probably a couple of feet above the

4077.79 --> 4081.45
actual water one that will I can stick

4080.16 --> 4083.67
into the water to measure the

4081.45 --> 4087.1499999999996
temperature of the water maybe get a

4083.67 --> 4089.85
barometer as well so yeah I try and be a

4087.15 --> 4093.03
little more scientific with having all

4089.85 --> 4097.5
the date but it's a lot of equipment

4093.03 --> 4099.569
carry it around yeah where I go in the

4097.5 --> 4102.779
area that I go to take footage most of

4099.569 --> 4104.700000000001
the time there's a there's a website

4102.779 --> 4107.7300000000005
very elaborate with a lot of details

4104.7 --> 4110.839
it's a phishing phishing website so it

4107.73 --> 4113.91
gives you all kinds of data for fitting

4110.839 --> 4114.93
you give you very detail on the tides

4113.91 --> 4116.55
and the

4114.93 --> 4118.92
the waves and other stuff and it gives

4116.55 --> 4121.8
you temperature of the water in

4118.92 --> 4123.6
different points in the area so I'm able

4121.8 --> 4124.35
to look it up you know whenever I go

4123.6 --> 4126.42
buddy

4124.35 --> 4129.71
the water is always hotter than the air

4126.42 --> 4129.71
every time I go

4136.16 --> 4142.34
oh wow oh you've already been going for

4139.46 --> 4144.32
over an hour time flies when you're

4142.34 --> 4147.41
having fun and good footage to look at

4144.32 --> 4150.469999999999
yeah I am

4147.41 --> 4154.16
I'd have to address freaking trolls for

4150.47 --> 4158.240000000001
a moment or not so much trolls as I'm

4154.16 --> 4162.71
getting so many of these people ballers

4158.24 --> 4165.92
that are constantly whining and whining

4162.71 --> 4168.14
and whining that we get entropy wrong

4165.92 --> 4172.13
and they're inserting all these other

4168.14 --> 4175.070000000001
things that are also involved in the

4172.13 --> 4177.4400000000005
entropy and constantly shouting it

4175.07 --> 4181.25
forward like know what you say does not

4177.44 --> 4184.849999999999
exist that is not real look this part is

4181.25 --> 4187.22
what entropy is and exactly contained

4184.85 --> 4189.71
within what you guys are saying that

4187.22 --> 4192.14
doesn't exist so that part of entropy

4189.71 --> 4197.8
does not exist all the arguments that we

4192.14 --> 4200.0
use but they're exclusive other region

4197.8 --> 4202.31
interpretations or applications of

4200.0 --> 4204.08
entropy that is relevant that is the

4202.31 --> 4207.200000000001
real entropy and we should all go to

4204.08 --> 4211.57
university to learn about that so we can

4207.2 --> 4216.23
forget our misinterpretation of entropy

4211.57 --> 4218.42
so we can stop stop banging that on

4216.23 --> 4220.82
their heads like yeah gas pressure

4218.42 --> 4221.81
without a container yeah that is entropy

4220.82 --> 4224.42
yeah that works

4221.81 --> 4225.92
entropy sets in first after that the

4224.42 --> 4229.07
other effects after that the gradient

4225.92 --> 4232.58
the random wandering the local force

4229.07 --> 4235.61
influences influenced motions first you

4232.58 --> 4237.5599999999995
got entropy we can just never say that

4235.61 --> 4240.049999999999
out loud because otherwise were idiots

4237.56 --> 4242.72
because we got it wrong this doesn't

4240.05 --> 4246.56
exist we just made it up out of nowhere

4242.72 --> 4248.45
and entropy is something else so let's

4246.56 --> 4252.9800000000005
just stop talking about it okay guys

4248.45 --> 4255.44
what do you say if your question if you

4252.98 --> 4260.15
question their religious science book

4255.44 --> 4262.25
written by Cox Nye the grass and family

4260.15 --> 4264.679999999999
and all they're a little religious

4262.25 --> 4266.3
called scientific leaders if you

4264.68 --> 4268.610000000001
question any of those they're gonna

4266.3 --> 4270.17
attack you are we so you have to go by

4268.61 --> 4272.929
mainstream science what is

4270.17 --> 4274.4890000000005
reiden it is don't question it don't try

4272.929 --> 4277.82
to find an alternative because you're

4274.489 --> 4280.28
gonna get a tag right I am I know but

4277.82 --> 4285.11
effect is one thing but that constant

4280.28 --> 4288.17
trick they do by entropy is a very wide

4285.11 --> 4290.21
concept it delves in all regions it

4288.17 --> 4297.11
delves into philosophy it delves into

4290.21 --> 4301.16
physics it delves into well the whole

4297.11 --> 4303.589999999999
thing about where it will inevitably end

4301.16 --> 4306.53
up with basically that is what entropy

4303.59 --> 4308.4800000000005
is all about and it also functions very

4306.53 --> 4313.5199999999995
directly in physics that's there that

4308.48 --> 4316.129999999999
exists but I don't get it how they can

4313.52 --> 4319.55
have this dislocation in their mind to

4316.13 --> 4322.37
completely ignore that well the other

4319.55 --> 4324.2300000000005
hand their bowler said also like the

4322.37 --> 4327.98
funny thing was yesterday is so sorry to

4324.23 --> 4330.98
break it up a bit but yesterday I was

4327.98 --> 4332.718999999999
saying like yeah you should know this -

4330.98 --> 4336.428999999999
conspiracy cat you should know this this

4332.719 --> 4339.53
is basic stuff you shouldn't be teaching

4336.429 --> 4341.929
the physics if you don't know this

4339.53 --> 4346.16
because I assumed yeah I learned it when

4341.929 --> 4349.28
I was 13 and I did but in retrospect I

4346.16 --> 4352.489
did absolutely did but was it in the

4349.28 --> 4354.92
curriculum no I learned about it because

4352.489 --> 4358.639999999999
I asked my teacher and he knew about it

4354.92 --> 4362.39
he also taught higher classes the exam

4358.64 --> 4364.400000000001
class is even a very very smart guy and

4362.39 --> 4366.56
I was taught about that and my brother

4364.4 --> 4368.9
taught me about it because he was also

4366.56 --> 4372.14
very good at physics and math and all

4368.9 --> 4375.29
that and computers so yeah but

4372.14 --> 4379.79
apparently this is taught I was told by

4375.29 --> 4382.64
a baller in university so thank you for

4379.79 --> 4386.81
that thank you for confirming that what

4382.64 --> 4391.219
I am teaching about entropy is in fact

4386.81 --> 4395.51
being taught in university so it does

4391.219 --> 4399.65
exist it's there how do you address this

4395.51 --> 4402.2300000000005
Randy and you mean for the trolls in the

4399.65 --> 4404.21
social act well it depends what subject

4402.23 --> 4407.959999999999
you're gonna gonna talk about if you

4404.21 --> 4409.88
if you trigger them with religion then

4407.96 --> 4413.72
you're gonna get all the religious

4409.88 --> 4417.14
haters coming in and essentially if you

4413.72 --> 4420.860000000001
do a video that rolls against neil

4417.14 --> 4422.87
degrasse excetera mick west of course

4420.86 --> 4425.87
you're gonna encourage their trolls to

4422.87 --> 4427.94
come along as well so it depends on how

4425.87 --> 4431.63
much content you want to put out what

4427.94 --> 4434.299999999999
content you actually do put out and i'm

4431.63 --> 4437.12
working on a video that's gonna get a

4434.3 --> 4439.09
lot of hatred I guarantee it because

4437.12 --> 4445.07
it's titled

4439.09 --> 4449.06
science versus religion creation versus

4445.07 --> 4451.429999999999
evolution creationism you mean of

4449.06 --> 4454.280000000001
creationism versus evolution so that's

4451.43 --> 4456.320000000001
going to be the title of the video and

4454.28 --> 4460.13
essentially I'm with a whole bunch of

4456.32 --> 4462.83
religions what their beliefs are then

4460.13 --> 4464.06
try and figure out how many people in

4462.83 --> 4466.61
the world actually practiced these

4464.06 --> 4468.5
realities and then ask them the question

4466.61 --> 4470.509999999999
well if you believe these religions and

4468.5 --> 4474.68
you believe that you know you were

4470.51 --> 4478.58
created and the earth is flat then how

4474.68 --> 4482.12
in your mind do you justify in countries

4478.58 --> 4484.82
like Saudi Arabia being taught a

4482.12 --> 4487.07
scientific model when most people in

4484.82 --> 4490.0
Saudi Arabia have a different religion

4487.07 --> 4492.469999999999
to what's being taught in their school

4490.0 --> 4495.98
do you see where I'm coming from because

4492.47 --> 4497.63
it has to be a addressed I think that

4495.98 --> 4499.73
you can't have a religion you can't be a

4497.63 --> 4503.14
practicing Catholic you can't be a

4499.73 --> 4506.599999999999
practicing Jew or whichever without

4503.14 --> 4508.490000000001
being in conflict to what the scientific

4506.6 --> 4511.240000000001
science is not on you

4508.49 --> 4513.5
what you're referring to now is

4511.24 --> 4517.75
fundamentalism religious fundamentalism

4513.5 --> 4521.81
that's very specific and look country's

4517.75 --> 4525.32
hard tend to not be fundamentalist

4521.81 --> 4528.740000000001
religious except for atheism they're the

4525.32 --> 4531.17
system basically because yeah the

4528.74 --> 4534.44
fundamentalist relate the Pro CH of many

4531.17 --> 4535.6900000000005
religions is to to basically point out

4534.44 --> 4539.61
look if Satan

4535.69 --> 4542.11
or the enemy the non-believer is

4539.61 --> 4545.259999999999
obviously lying to everyone and

4542.11 --> 4545.53
blaspheming the truth whatever that may

4545.26 --> 4547.39
be

4545.53 --> 4550.12
yeah you're you're gonna have to stop it

4547.39 --> 4554.740000000001
and so yeah that's the issue with

4550.12 --> 4559.48
fundamentalism and if countries do in

4554.74 --> 4561.01
fact abandon this yeah it's hard to say

4559.48 --> 4564.129999999999
but yeah that's actually a good thing

4561.01 --> 4567.9400000000005
because that method is very destructive

4564.13 --> 4570.79
and disruptive on the other hand yeah

4567.94 --> 4573.4
we're gonna get the same old ball crap

4570.79 --> 4575.7699999999995
in its place that will start to arrive

4573.4 --> 4578.44
and it will be on a cultural level of

4575.77 --> 4581.17
the people themselves and their beliefs

4578.44 --> 4584.799999999999
if they will resist it or if they will

4581.17 --> 4587.32
embrace it and basically dilapidate the

4584.8 --> 4589.78
ways of the religion that they were

4587.32 --> 4592.2
originally taught just like in the West

4589.78 --> 4595.09
doesn't happen it's up to them

4592.2 --> 4597.73
so ranty is gonna get off his way he's

4595.09 --> 4599.8
not gonna be poking the bear like little

4597.73 --> 4601.8099999999995
challenge to slice for cane he's gonna

4599.8 --> 4604.3
be poking their masses on creating this

4601.81 --> 4607.6
type of video yeah more power to you man

4604.3 --> 4610.63
absolutely go for it go for it it'll

4607.6 --> 4612.22
open up the debate that's that's the

4610.63 --> 4615.58
main thing it will it will encourage

4612.22 --> 4619.12
more discussion on this very topic and

4615.58 --> 4623.34
it is a very subjective topic it's a

4619.12 --> 4626.62
very heated topic so I expect a lot of

4623.34 --> 4628.6
pushback from it to be fair because it

4626.62 --> 4632.53
is addressing a very real thing you know

4628.6 --> 4638.110000000001
I mean you can't have a religion that

4632.53 --> 4641.139999999999
practices being created and also go to

4638.11 --> 4644.0199999999995
school and then be taught that we

4641.14 --> 4647.77
evolved from a big bang and monkeys

4644.02 --> 4653.22
don't forget that so you know that

4647.77 --> 4653.22
there's a you know there's a definite

4654.15 --> 4661.8099999999995
whether it's there's a there's a direct

4657.94 --> 4664.36
conflict yes there is and the real

4661.81 --> 4666.679
hardcore fundamentalist will be severely

4664.36 --> 4670.13
pissed off if that's gonna happen

4666.679 --> 4672.2300000000005
so yeah yeah me personally I'm not

4670.13 --> 4674.179
really really interested in this subject

4672.23 --> 4676.3099999999995
I haven't research him enough I don't

4674.179 --> 4678.32
have a big opinion on him I'll check it

4676.31 --> 4681.02
out you know I'll support whatever you

4678.32 --> 4683.239
guys do I just might have had a comment

4681.02 --> 4686.150000000001
or an opinion on it but it's cool yeah

4683.239 --> 4689.409
do do what you got to do good on the

4686.15 --> 4693.5599999999995
other hand what I would love to see is

4689.409 --> 4695.509999999999
that in schools there would arise the

4693.56 --> 4698.360000000001
debate not a replacement like oh yeah

4695.51 --> 4701.6
what you learn in the Quran or the Bible

4698.36 --> 4703.37
or whatever book you used that's all

4701.6 --> 4706.7300000000005
[ __ ] this is the real thing with

4703.37 --> 4711.969
science and space know what you could

4706.73 --> 4716.209999999999
instead do is open up a debate about it

4711.969 --> 4717.949
within schools so like okay this is what

4716.21 --> 4719.78
this book teaches from our traditional

4717.949 --> 4723.29
religion and this is what they teach

4719.78 --> 4725.659
what do you guys think what could it be

4723.29 --> 4726.65
how can we examine what could be the

4725.659 --> 4730.5199999999995
real truth here

4726.65 --> 4733.3099999999995
you know Oh get some actual discovery in

4730.52 --> 4736.01
the schools again get some real working

4733.31 --> 4738.679
out the details in fact his belief that

4736.01 --> 4740.780000000001
there's probably 50 different religions

4738.679 --> 4745.28
throughout the world and it has to be

4740.78 --> 4747.71
one of the preached that we were created

4745.28 --> 4751.94
we've lived on the Flat Earth or some

4747.71 --> 4755.2390000000005
kind of firmament and we've known this

4751.94 --> 4758.96
for thousands of years thousands of

4755.239 --> 4761.36
years and yet then the science Brigade

4758.96 --> 4765.9800000000005
came along and within a couple of

4761.36 --> 4768.349999999999
hundred years of basically tried to wipe

4765.98 --> 4770.0
that entire history by saying we're

4768.35 --> 4772.67
correct were correct believers believers

4770.0 --> 4775.4
and what they're doing is they've

4772.67 --> 4778.34
infiltrated everywhere without a single

4775.4 --> 4781.07
shred of bloody evidence for it no

4778.34 --> 4784.01
scientific proof of gravity no proof of

4781.07 --> 4786.32
the the makeup of the actual surface or

4784.01 --> 4788.54
the underground that we actually live on

4786.32 --> 4790.46
so no core you know we don't know any of

4788.54 --> 4792.89
this stuff they have no scientific group

4790.46 --> 4796.579
but they have a lot of nice stories and

4792.89 --> 4800.119000000001
a lot of magicians tricks and in

4796.579 --> 4804.579
firing space footage yeah and how are

4800.119 --> 4807.978999999999
they managed how am I managed brainwash

4804.579 --> 4811.369
with glorious promises of a glorious

4807.979 --> 4813.589
future that cannot be possible

4811.369 --> 4816.978999999999
if we were to believe that the world is

4813.589 --> 4819.019
in fact flat and created and all that

4816.979 --> 4822.579000000001
and there is no outer space so it is

4819.019 --> 4823.820000000001
that all of us promise that actually

4822.579 --> 4826.489
deludes

4823.82 --> 4830.03
people like a little kid and puts them

4826.489 --> 4833.329
in that dream of a futurist Star Trek

4830.03 --> 4836.898999999999
world where we could all expand and we

4833.329 --> 4838.938999999999
can all grow to a hundred billion humans

4836.899 --> 4841.280000000001
and we would still have room how lovely

4838.939 --> 4846.019
well guess what that's not gonna happen

4841.28 --> 4850.129
in reality ever and that's all that you

4846.019 --> 4852.439
gotta let go if you know somebody that

4850.129 --> 4856.01
was born and raised in a Christian

4852.439 --> 4859.76
environment like father was a fire dad

4856.01 --> 4861.709
was a black a Christian pastor and every

4859.76 --> 4863.899
single day since they were born going to

4861.709 --> 4865.789
church for thirty years of their lives

4863.899 --> 4867.530000000001
and they know kind of the Bible back on

4865.789 --> 4870.589
forward and they got a big opinion on it

4867.53 --> 4872.179
it'd be interesting that right that's me

4870.589 --> 4874.899
and I don't talk about the Bible I don't

4872.179 --> 4878.03
talk about church my dad was a pastor

4874.899 --> 4880.609
salamé until he retired I was thirty

4878.03 --> 4882.469
years old and I never speak about it

4880.609 --> 4885.169000000001
because I'm not interested in oh and I

4882.469 --> 4888.05
know the back and forth you know my

4885.169 --> 4890.209
wife's uncle he translates Bible

4888.05 --> 4892.189
together is one of the big shots on on

4890.209 --> 4894.379
the Christian movement you know

4892.189 --> 4896.51
translating Bibles and and he goes

4894.379 --> 4897.379
travel all over the world you know but

4896.51 --> 4900.709
ups

4897.379 --> 4903.439
I'm not know why I mean that's crazy you

4900.709 --> 4906.1089999999995
know I should be like a big voice in

4903.439 --> 4909.139
this subject and ya know I stay out of

4906.109 --> 4912.349
it he's gonna respond to Ronnie Ronnie

4909.139 --> 4914.899
Bakshi who comment he said but space is

4912.349 --> 4916.869000000001
more is no more interesting from where

4914.899 --> 4920.809
we stand

4916.869 --> 4922.489
exactly it's no more interesting but we

4920.809 --> 4924.859
don't know where we stop we don't know

4922.489 --> 4927.648999999999
how far this actually stretches for all

4924.859 --> 4930.89
we know we could be a very very very

4927.649 --> 4933.56
small part of a huge play

4930.89 --> 4935.42
we are just told that this is where we

4933.56 --> 4937.1
live and we can't go any further this is

4935.42 --> 4940.27
where we don't go to the north all the

4937.1 --> 4944.05
little goats of the South Pole

4940.27 --> 4949.64
so yeah I mean we are in some respects

4944.05 --> 4953.6
kept in wherever we are we are confined

4949.64 --> 4956.75
to where we are told is is where we live

4953.6 --> 4958.52
and yet we have people in the past that

4956.75 --> 4961.16
have said there is additional Landers

4958.52 --> 4963.650000000001
third alarm there's more land than what

4961.16 --> 4966.08
we've been told and if we have credible

4963.65 --> 4969.889999999999
people talking like that and telling us

4966.08 --> 4970.93
this and then we have proof that the the

4969.89 --> 4975.14
governments throughout the world

4970.93 --> 4977.6900000000005
deliberately stopped in travel to the

4975.14 --> 4979.58
Antarctic or below South where is it

4977.69 --> 4982.54
South what degree is it I went to South

4979.58 --> 4986.63
18 of them it something like that and

4982.54 --> 4992.15
South T yeah last year long to do it all

4986.63 --> 4994.25
up no you don't know I think longitude

4992.15 --> 4997.549999999999
is from north to south and latitudes

4994.25 --> 5001.12
east to west great well well anyway

4997.55 --> 5003.1900000000005
these you know these government agencies

5001.12 --> 5005.17
have stopped travel in that location so

5003.19 --> 5007.929999999999
you can't go further you can't go out

5005.17 --> 5011.32
and explore you can't go and see yes if

5007.93 --> 5014.59
this this is true when when we were told

5011.32 --> 5017.469999999999
that there is X and we have that on tape

5014.59 --> 5019.27
we have proof Admiral Byrd saying that

5017.47 --> 5021.7
there is extra line but we can't go and

5019.27 --> 5023.410000000001
explore that so we are confined we are

5021.7 --> 5025.8099999999995
kept in where we are captive

5023.41 --> 5028.09
we are old this is where we live and

5025.81 --> 5029.92
that's it and yet for all we know there

5028.09 --> 5033.49
could we could be a very small part of a

5029.92 --> 5036.24
very big place because and we just don't

5033.49 --> 5040.0599999999995
know we could be part of a bigger place

5036.24 --> 5043.99
not only a huge place that still would

5040.06 --> 5046.3
not solve the issue though because now

5043.99 --> 5048.28
what about exploration what would be a

5046.3 --> 5051.31
better exploration and go in and find

5048.28 --> 5054.099999999999
out these additional lumps people talk

5051.31 --> 5056.35
about good that's good but what yeah but

5054.1 --> 5058.21
I'm gonna you know and fire Mentalist on

5056.35 --> 5060.13
your ass right now so if there's all

5058.21 --> 5061.9
these other lands and there's no humans

5060.13 --> 5064.26
there what's going to be there probably

5061.9 --> 5067.41
a lot of nature nature that

5064.26 --> 5070.08
the world also depends on for its

5067.41 --> 5072.8
breathing capacities for example and

5070.08 --> 5075.72
what would happen if we then start to

5072.8 --> 5078.03
industrialize and have yeah inhabit

5075.72 --> 5080.16
those lands and everything else yeah

5078.03 --> 5083.219999999999
we'd have all this fabulous room and

5080.16 --> 5086.25
then we'd all choke to death in a couple

5083.22 --> 5088.59
of decades you don't know how far this

5086.25 --> 5090.75
stretches are we for all we know they

5088.59 --> 5093.78
could already be inhabited by previous

5090.75 --> 5095.55
civilizations the Tartarian for instance

5093.78 --> 5097.65
we don't know what to them we don't know

5095.55 --> 5099.9890000000005
whether do it defeated or whether or not

5097.65 --> 5102.599999999999
they you know just disappeared maybe

5099.989 --> 5105.089999999999
they went further afield and left us to

5102.6 --> 5107.04
this place that we now know is where we

5105.09 --> 5108.27
live good and they and they went

5107.04 --> 5111.93
exploring because they were more

5108.27 --> 5113.9400000000005
advanced technologically and why then it

5111.93 --> 5115.7390000000005
then they've explored and they've

5113.94 --> 5118.799999999999
inhabited these places maybe these

5115.739 --> 5121.7699999999995
places have FOB maybe these UFOs that we

5118.8 --> 5124.02
see in our skies maybe these all under

5121.77 --> 5127.200000000001
here are not technology for him outer

5124.02 --> 5130.410000000001
space but from rural area from further

5127.2 --> 5132.42
afield extra realm Ian yes sir I mean

5130.41 --> 5134.37
yes so these craft that we said that

5132.42 --> 5137.01
have been captured we have seen them

5134.37 --> 5139.53
they do exist I don't have to say they

5137.01 --> 5141.54
come from space but they might come from

5139.53 --> 5144.57
further afield yes

5141.54 --> 5148.38
extra or extra dimensional can't be

5144.57 --> 5150.599999999999
excluded relating also a quick a quick

5148.38 --> 5152.76
you know a quick little nugget I'm gonna

5150.6 --> 5154.77
throw in here who knows if it's just

5152.76 --> 5157.35
regular humans like us they're just

5154.77 --> 5160.110000000001
building different type of civilization

5157.35 --> 5161.820000000001
with different infrastructure with a

5160.11 --> 5163.139999999999
different economy different government

5161.82 --> 5166.5599999999995
how about the thousands of children

5163.14 --> 5168.72
getting missing and who knows what kinds

5166.56 --> 5171.6900000000005
of professionals in every single field

5168.72 --> 5173.31
they are just you know getting bored

5171.69 --> 5174.78
dream born over there and getting a

5173.31 --> 5176.79
different type of education and

5174.78 --> 5177.54
different type of indoctrination what

5176.79 --> 5180.18
yes

5177.54 --> 5181.29
are you saying that no that the extra

5180.18 --> 5184.320000000001
realm Ian's maybe

5181.29 --> 5188.64
kidnapping our children to integrate

5184.32 --> 5191.389999999999
into their society no I say a very very

5188.64 --> 5194.43
interesting concept for a new series

5191.39 --> 5196.410000000001
either that or it could be just humans

5194.43 --> 5197.91
you know people with power they just

5196.41 --> 5199.7699999999995
take this route through and

5197.91 --> 5202.26
Kartika or whatever and they just take

5199.77 --> 5204.900000000001
these children this very knowledge

5202.26 --> 5206.91
knowledgeable people to that extra piece

5204.9 --> 5209.549999999999
of land which they got this bigger

5206.91 --> 5211.62
different types of culture than we do

5209.55 --> 5213.54
you know and they they do things

5211.62 --> 5216.18
different and they just are born have

5213.54 --> 5221.13
the largest race over there and taught

5216.18 --> 5224.400000000001
different that off you know it could be

5221.13 --> 5227.1
possible it and as I just said yeah that

5224.4 --> 5232.2
is just the perfect no plot for a new

5227.1 --> 5234.54
Netflix series extra realm in abduction

5232.2 --> 5237.48
of children our they're going to grow up

5234.54 --> 5245.19
in this other super technological

5237.48 --> 5247.169999999999
society no I'm not no I'm not you know

5245.19 --> 5250.429999999999
me I don't know I don't know I have no

5247.17 --> 5253.47
idea I know yeah people do go missing

5250.43 --> 5256.41
yeah probably some of them do go into

5253.47 --> 5258.87
this disgusting satanic pedophile

5256.41 --> 5264.84
dungeon scene but maybe some of them are

5258.87 --> 5268.95
just exchanged with other extra realm in

5264.84 --> 5271.32
societies I don't know you're gonna have

5268.95 --> 5275.25
to find them over there to actually

5271.32 --> 5279.0
confirm it that's it so we've got a

5275.25 --> 5281.91
breakthrough this science block which is

5279.0 --> 5284.64
keeping those where we are told we live

5281.91 --> 5287.94
and once we've broken through that

5284.64 --> 5292.05
science block we can get travel to these

5287.94 --> 5295.23
places no that's not that's not the

5292.05 --> 5297.75
second step the second step is first for

5295.23 --> 5301.5
these other places to officially reveal

5297.75 --> 5304.47
themselves and say hi earth realm yes we

5301.5 --> 5307.11
live here this is our territory don't

5304.47 --> 5310.35
try to mess with us we've been keeping

5307.11 --> 5312.9
very quiet here but don't get any bright

5310.35 --> 5315.39
ideas because we are technologically

5312.9 --> 5321.66
advanced at least 300 years ahead of you

5315.39 --> 5324.42
I wouldn't expect them to welcome us

5321.66 --> 5327.99
anyway because no Dave will not not on a

5324.42 --> 5330.93
on a wider scale at least no we we are

5327.99 --> 5331.71
might individuals who might try we an

5330.93 --> 5334.71
aggressive

5331.71 --> 5336.4800000000005
civilization you know we we like to call

5334.71 --> 5338.81
it we like you know there are countries

5336.48 --> 5341.82
that deliberately go out of the way to

5338.81 --> 5344.400000000001
kill as many people as they can you know

5341.82 --> 5346.98
infidels and religion and all that kind

5344.4 --> 5350.909
of stuff we are not max people as a

5346.98 --> 5355.379999999999
whole so it's no wonder they know now I

5350.909 --> 5358.679
disagree it is a wide spectrum of very

5355.38 --> 5359.159000000001
good and absolutely evil and everything

5358.679 --> 5361.8
in between

5359.159 --> 5365.94
that is our civilization our human

5361.8 --> 5368.820000000001
civilization in our realm support people

5365.94 --> 5371.28
at the top though of the aggressive sack

5368.82 --> 5377.009999999999
paths the ones with the fingers on the

5371.28 --> 5379.259999999999
bottom that's also not necessarily a

5377.01 --> 5383.9400000000005
hundred percent true that may also be a

5379.26 --> 5386.76
myth to basically encourage us to take

5383.94 --> 5389.969
back control I'm not too sure how how

5386.76 --> 5392.79
bad that really is yes their controllers

5389.969 --> 5397.77
are not gonna be just really decent

5392.79 --> 5399.9
normal human beings but to say they are

5397.77 --> 5404.31
all total Psychopaths and they're all

5399.9 --> 5408.509999999999
just every day to destroy the world

5404.31 --> 5415.469
today no that's not reality sorry it has

5408.51 --> 5419.1
a big like idiom I have really quick in

5415.469 --> 5421.64
that Ronnie for Shaffer he earlier he

5419.1 --> 5424.2300000000005
type in common and he say he was gonna

5421.64 --> 5425.88
create some videos and he wanted to use

5424.23 --> 5428.879999999999
some of my foolish yeah in my about page

5425.88 --> 5430.7390000000005
I say if anybody liked my videos you can

5428.88 --> 5432.75

within a month a really good computer

5642.49 --> 5646.69
with good it's like a gaming computer so

you're gonna have a really good video

5646.69 --> 5652.0599999999995
card I want to install some really cool

5649.63 --> 5653.77
video programming to do graphics and

5652.06 --> 5655.75
stuff like that so oh I'm looking

5653.77 --> 5657.64
forward to have that because I was

5655.75 --> 5659.23
really good on computers a few years

5657.64 --> 5662.08
back but I haven't gave one in a while

5659.23 --> 5664.24
so it's like a new toy for me I can't

5662.08 --> 5668.38
wait to process my videos through a

5664.24 --> 5672.3099999999995
computer man you wanna present my screen

5668.38 --> 5675.3
satin Arlene yeah sorry I was just

5672.31 --> 5679.280000000001
distracted by a pretty severe

5675.3 --> 5683.539
reputation here of mg42 pillbox and chat

5679.28 --> 5688.469
but yeah let's get home there you go

5683.539 --> 5690.119
so um we've all heard the you're not

5688.469 --> 5697.44
really presenting right now by the way

5690.119 --> 5700.079
you're on your hangout page yeah stop

5697.44 --> 5707.789
sharing let me try again

5700.079 --> 5708.179
um screen share ID and then can you see

5707.789 --> 5714.96
that

5708.179 --> 5717.499
oh wait that's part of a video yo I

5714.96 --> 5720.42
thought you did you showed your hangout

5717.499 --> 5721.59
no no no alright yeah you're presented

5720.42 --> 5725.55
well

5721.59 --> 5729.8
pima's porn bombs flat earth data simple

5725.55 --> 5734.4890000000005
as that I released a video detail in it

5729.8 --> 5738.059
pima's uploaded a video in response and

5734.489 --> 5741.9
apparently the porn bomber sent him a

5738.059 --> 5744.51
video of him screen capturing the moment

5741.9 --> 5746.549999999999
when he actually porn bombed the site

5744.51 --> 5749.820000000001
and it wasn't P Mars apparently

5746.55 --> 5752.070000000001
and P Mars has proof this is the video

5749.82 --> 5753.84
that he released it says rum tees ramen

5752.07 --> 5756.48
proof I did inform bomb Flat Earth

5753.84 --> 5758.34
discord now as you can see the only

5756.48 --> 5761.03
person that's left in the Hangout is P

5758.34 --> 5764.039
Mars who P Mars has actually admitted

5761.03 --> 5767.249
that both myself and Flat Earth data

5764.039 --> 5771.329
we've removed by him right he then

5767.249 --> 5773.01
claims that just split second after both

5771.329 --> 5775.558999999999
myself and their Flat Earth Day to

5773.01 --> 5778.320000000001
removed he himself was snapped out of

5775.559 --> 5780.63
the Hangout and that somebody else

5778.32 --> 5784.86
joined porn bombed the site and it

5780.63 --> 5787.32
wasn't P Mars right so this is the this

5784.86 --> 5789.058999999999
is the the most important part of the

5787.32 --> 5792.179
video where he gets snapped

5789.059 --> 5794.159000000001
apparently so P Mars is in in the top

5792.179 --> 5796.71
right we have here says P Mars will be

5794.159 --> 5799.589999999999
removed from this group conversation

5796.71 --> 5801.2390000000005
yeah removing from group question mark P

5799.59 --> 5803.610000000001
Mars will be removed from this group

5801.239 --> 5806.669999999999
conversation yeah and then he's going to

5803.61 --> 5808.349999999999
click remove so what would you expect to

5806.67 --> 5813.45
see them on the

5808.35 --> 5818.06
next Bush frames there we go you left

5813.45 --> 5819.72
the video call you left the video call

5818.06 --> 5825.89
not the sniper

5819.72 --> 5831.75
pima's left the video call she left it

5825.89 --> 5833.43
he's just right there he Mars will be he

5831.75 --> 5837.48
Mars will be removed from the group

5833.43 --> 5840.780000000001
conversation remove you left the video

5837.48 --> 5843.509999999999
call he snapped himself he took himself

5840.78 --> 5846.05
out and then he loaded himself back in

5843.51 --> 5848.16
immediately we watched him do it live

5846.05 --> 5851.25
who else was in there were you there

5848.16 --> 5854.25
Chuckie Chuckie mat has been there were

5851.25 --> 5855.99
you there Jose did you see as well no I

5854.25 --> 5858.09
wasn't there I heard I was popular

5855.99 --> 5860.34
Chuckie saw it and we actually watched

5858.09 --> 5861.54
him doing it on the screen we watched

5860.34 --> 5864.3
him going through all these files and

5861.54 --> 5866.67
putting me off so yeah

5864.3 --> 5869.22
he left the video goal I mean it saw is

5866.67 --> 5871.61
in your faces right there you left the

5869.22 --> 5874.26
video call P Mars was filming himself

5871.61 --> 5876.0
remove himself from the video call and

5874.26 --> 5877.83
the next screen says you left the video

5876.0 --> 5882.45
call well who was the person that would

5877.83 --> 5884.22
remove from the video call pima's P Mars

5882.45 --> 5886.7699999999995
will be removed from the group he's in

5884.22 --> 5889.530000000001
and then the next couple of frames you

5886.77 --> 5890.43
left the video call it's all that's all

5889.53 --> 5892.59
you need to know

5890.43 --> 5901.5
he claims he got snapped no he left the

5892.59 --> 5906.17
video call boss did ah so anyway that's

5901.5 --> 5906.17
embarrassing the virus very very much

5906.57 --> 5911.369
it's horrible you know to take people

5908.61 --> 5913.619
off you know take people off the

5911.369 --> 5915.48
equation like that you know everybody

5913.619 --> 5917.579
should be allowed to create something

5915.48 --> 5919.5
and do say whatever they want to say you

5917.579 --> 5923.13
know I don't see like I don't I don't

5919.5 --> 5927.119
see the need for it I don't even think

5923.13 --> 5929.46
it is necessarily that they porn bomb to

5927.119 --> 5933.239
stop their speech they're just there to

5929.46 --> 5935.219
be a dick and abuse power that's role I

5933.239 --> 5937.919999999999
think that is really the reason why P

5935.219 --> 5939.059
Morris does it when he does it well I

5937.92 --> 5941.219
know why he did it

5939.059 --> 5943.110000000001
I do know I did it because I was

5941.219 --> 5946.86
actually in the hang out at the time and

5943.11 --> 5950.159
I could feel it going down and I did

5946.86 --> 5953.219
feel that flat earth data was you know

5950.159 --> 5954.69
he was he was pushing pushing him a

5953.219 --> 5957.269
little bit you know he was sort of like

5954.69 --> 5958.949
trying to trigger him and he when he

5957.269 --> 5961.71
actually said oh well guess what Ramsey

5958.949 --> 5962.879999999999
I'm going to be removing P miles now and

5961.71 --> 5964.17
this is the reason why I went to get

5962.88 --> 5965.639
removed P Mars you're going to get

5964.17 --> 5967.32
removed because this the other blah blah

5965.639 --> 5969.78
blah and they're barely basically what

5967.32 --> 5971.67
he was doing was he was if he was

5969.78 --> 5975.449
imagining it from Pima side he would

5971.67 --> 5978.96
have felt that he was being controlled

5975.449 --> 5981.75
and spoken down to and he had no power

5978.96 --> 5983.579
in this situation and basically what he

5981.75 --> 5986.489
did then was basically give him two

5983.579 --> 5987.929
fingers by going well you know what I

5986.489 --> 5988.32
know you're gonna say all this but you

5987.929 --> 5989.76
know what

5988.32 --> 5991.679
I'm gonna snap you guys out and then

5989.76 --> 5992.76
they played porn on your channel and for

5991.679 --> 5993.75
three months you won't be do it and

5992.76 --> 5995.76
that's what you're gonna get

5993.75 --> 5997.409
they're talking to me like that I know

5995.76 --> 6000.650000000001
exactly why you did it because I

5997.409 --> 6002.299999999999
actually could see in his eyes what was

6000.65 --> 6004.759999999999
going through his head because I felt

6002.3 --> 6007.610000000001
people P Mars doesn't respond well to

6004.76 --> 6009.67
people saying this to him and he didn't

6007.61 --> 6012.348999999999
know that P Mars with this type of

6009.67 --> 6014.809
personality who will do that and that's

6012.349 --> 6019.13
exactly why he did it yeah okay yeah

6014.809 --> 6021.559
well that's a big danger don't bring out

6019.13 --> 6024.32
your mouth against people that you don't

6021.559 --> 6026.51
know it is you don't do it it's stupid

6024.32 --> 6028.88
because yeah there's some real maniacs

6026.51 --> 6032.719
amongst these people and Pete Mars is

6028.88 --> 6036.26
one of them if you try to if you invite

6032.719 --> 6037.72
P Morris and then you push him out yeah

6036.26 --> 6039.9400000000005
you got a problem

6037.72 --> 6042.1900000000005
he's gonna try to [ __ ] up your hangout

6039.94 --> 6044.349999999999
and [ __ ] up your channel as much as he

6042.19 --> 6047.259999999999
can from that point on until he's

6044.35 --> 6051.240000000001
satisfied that he's done enough damage P

6047.26 --> 6054.51
Mars so be very careful who you invite

6051.24 --> 6057.37
learn something about them before you do

6054.51 --> 6060.610000000001
that's why I don't invite just anyone

6057.37 --> 6062.44
adding me on skype on the panel I I'm

6060.61 --> 6065.44
gonna talk with them first see who they

6062.44 --> 6068.5
are and what they're like before I

6065.44 --> 6070.299999999999
consider it otherwise the same kind of

6068.5 --> 6072.13
crap would happen to me I have to be

6070.3 --> 6075.85
very careful with your guests if you

6072.13 --> 6077.71
want to if you want to live if you want

6122.89 --> 6127.0
hundred countdown them from a thousand

6124.6 --> 6127.54
we can literally count it down it'll be

6127.0 --> 6130.9
pretty cool

6127.54 --> 6132.76
yes yeah guys before you run out like

6130.9 --> 6134.74
please yeah don't do these supporting

6132.76 --> 6137.92
shoulder because without flat earthers

6134.74 --> 6140.26
the borders have no content and come on

6137.92 --> 6142.66
you cannot be form bombing on shutting

6140.26 --> 6144.46
us down we all have the right to speak

6142.66 --> 6146.83
up and say whatever we want to say you

6144.46 --> 6149.02
know whoever is doing it whatever is

6146.83 --> 6151.36
happening you should support each other

6149.02 --> 6153.43
even Nader I mean guys we got a

6151.36 --> 6155.38
subordinator I mean we got it we gotta

6153.43 --> 6157.900000000001

6155.38 --> 6159.67
him we miss him here in the panel and we

6157.9 --> 6161.83
all miss him in the ball is because we

6159.67 --> 6163.93

6161.83 --> 6166.5

6163.93 --> 6168.43

we thank you for a minute

6168.43 --> 6171.92
ah

6168.86 --> 6176.139999999999
see Krypto Allah he subscribed to my

6171.92 --> 6180.9800000000005
channel excellent is that 899 let's see

6176.14 --> 6185.96
899 probably actually 898 I don't know

6180.98 --> 6189.11
why there's a little delay describers at

6185.96 --> 6190.9
least like takes at least 15 minutes or

6189.11 --> 6193.429999999999
something before it actually registers

6190.9 --> 6197.839999999999
so it might be a little bit difficult to

6193.43 --> 6200.6900000000005
get it the visual of 900 within this

6197.84 --> 6204.35
show but I think I probably get there

6200.69 --> 6206.179999999999
before the next show starts so I am

6204.35 --> 6207.950000000001
gonna round out the show unless you guys

6206.18 --> 6212.150000000001

6207.95 --> 6212.929999999999
specific subject no I think that's I

6212.15 --> 6216.139999999999
