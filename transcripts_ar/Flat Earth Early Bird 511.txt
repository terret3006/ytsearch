82.619 --> 93.0
again the weather today is pretty

86.459 --> 97.039
gorgeous kind of same as yesterday maybe

93.0 --> 100.039
is slightly more fresh but yeah still

97.039 --> 100.039
beautiful

104.37 --> 107.30000000000001
beautiful

116.2 --> 133.79
yeah yeah so I got Tamera coffee with me

137.03 --> 143.98
yesterday but oh well

139.66 --> 148.43
mmm our boorish stuff still is first a

143.98 --> 156.92
man a young Java light energy James

148.43 --> 160.209
Mason Steve good servant oh yeah

156.92 --> 163.82
Obama cool yeah good to see you

160.209 --> 168.38
nineteen watching already but jet seems

163.82 --> 173.10999999999999
a little slow maybe but I guess it'll

168.38 --> 176.45
all come in soon enough so yeah I was

173.11 --> 178.13000000000002
extremely active yesterday surprisingly

176.45 --> 181.13
so because I thought yesterday was gonna

178.13 --> 186.38
be kind of a slow day for me well I was

181.13 --> 196.549
wrong it has been added yeah almost the

186.38 --> 199.07
entire evening so after yesterday the

196.549 --> 200.42000000000002
show went on flat earth debates and the

199.07 --> 204.739
after show as well

200.42 --> 209.56
I wasn't even too active because also my

204.739 --> 214.22
yeah for some reason the Hangout system

209.56 --> 216.829
just silenced me I remember this

214.22 --> 218.6
happening before remember I don't know

216.829 --> 222.89000000000001
if you guys remember but it was like I

218.6 --> 225.26
think half a year ago that happened as

222.89 --> 229.16
well all of a sudden it kept up for like

225.26 --> 231.04899999999998
a week maybe two weeks I think it's just

229.16 --> 234.41
week and then it's and it kind of

231.049 --> 236.78
stopped again was again it was during an

234.41 --> 239.69
update situation I guess that when

236.78 --> 244.55
YouTube changes functions

239.69 --> 248.51
I think what may be happening is that

244.55 --> 251.09
because of just the giant amount of data

248.51 --> 253.54999999999998
that involves the programming of the

251.09 --> 257.959
YouTube system just a general system

253.55 --> 260.33
that even the controlling of it any AI

257.959 --> 262.64
but just the the mechanisms it's because

260.33 --> 265.90999999999997
it's so giant a typical thing that

262.64 --> 268.09999999999997
happens that I remember from my

265.91 --> 269.87
experience and listening to programmers

268.1 --> 274.88
is was something that typically happens

269.87 --> 278.41
is that when updating something it's

274.88 --> 282.08
very typical that by accident old codes

278.41 --> 285.44
slip in again so something was updated

282.08 --> 287.33
it's been tinkered but then an older

285.44 --> 290.51
template is used because it's not as

287.33 --> 293.81
clutter it's as finely carved and then

290.51 --> 296.56
filled in and made complex for the new

293.81 --> 300.44
update and then accidentally the same

296.56 --> 303.62
the same errors or lack of updates slip

300.44 --> 306.14
in again and then the updater forgets

303.62 --> 308.39
about that see see that's something that

306.14 --> 312.16999999999996
happens so I think that might be the

308.39 --> 313.7
cause this kind of flaw because there's

312.17 --> 316.88
no damn reason for that to happen it's

313.7 --> 319.82
just an error and it typically does go

316.88 --> 325.58
away so I think that may be the cause of

319.82 --> 326.2
that right anyway after that I yea

325.58 --> 330.8
called

326.2 --> 332.84
good serving over Skype and ya know what

330.8 --> 335.99
Tom Parker wasn't there unfortunately

332.84 --> 338.15
yeah would have been interesting but I

335.99 --> 343.25
yeah I just did a one on one with good

338.15 --> 347.63
servant for about 44 minutes and yeah I

343.25 --> 351.56
thought it was really good I was yeah I

347.63 --> 353.919
was fluid and deep subjects it was nice

351.56 --> 356.84
so yeah it was very satisfied with that

353.919 --> 359.35999999999996
yes I think good servant just posted it

356.84 --> 360.83
in the chat so do take a look if you

359.36 --> 363.93
haven't already and subscribe to good

360.83 --> 366.55
servant Channel it's a very promising

363.93 --> 372.47
[Music]

366.55 --> 377.84000000000003
seed doesn't wear because he's really

372.47 --> 382.19000000000005
just starting out so yeah that I did

377.84 --> 384.91999999999996
that and then after that was I think

382.19 --> 391.0
that was yesterday right I went to

384.92 --> 394.31
Jose's and got in like as a first guest

391.0 --> 396.5
the it was very funny because I got in

394.31 --> 399.02
there got a bit silly with the baller

396.5 --> 402.23
trolls that were all or we knew oh no or

399.02 --> 404.51
not Ari they were all squirting again as

402.23 --> 407.36
usual is typically what happens when I

404.51 --> 410.8
get in the chat that's I don't know it's

407.36 --> 415.22
almost kind of amusing how allergic ly

410.8 --> 417.35
they respond to my presence there and I

415.22 --> 420.08000000000004
don't really let them get to me anymore

417.35 --> 421.91
you know it's because it's the same

420.08 --> 424.96999999999997
people and when I just realized oh my

421.91 --> 429.28000000000003
god every time they just do this it's so

424.97 --> 432.44000000000005
basic it's so basic there's so little

429.28 --> 434.78
thought and planning even to what they

432.44 --> 437.81
do when they do that that eventually it

434.78 --> 443.83
just doesn't seem intuitively even like

437.81 --> 447.44
a threat anymore it's just yeah like a I

443.83 --> 449.27
don't know like like a bird or an animal

447.44 --> 451.88
that just gets territorial all of a

449.27 --> 454.03999999999996
sudden it's they don't think about it it

451.88 --> 458.21
just happens to them so that's what it's

454.04 --> 462.94
like to me so I don't mind anyway Jose

458.21 --> 465.44
spotted me oh yeah somebody in there got

462.94 --> 467.9
really weird on me and said that I was

465.44 --> 471.59
like a crypto Jew and that my father was

467.9 --> 478.42999999999995
a Jew and it's like what where did that

471.59 --> 480.169
come from and yeah like that doesn't

478.43 --> 483.53000000000003
usually happen I just thought it was

480.169 --> 489.22999999999996
weird like really what's your evidence

483.53 --> 492.08
is I there's actually funnily something

489.23 --> 492.89000000000004
to it but it's just very minor you know

492.08 --> 494.78
I have

492.89 --> 497.78
yeah just like Owen Bend you and I have

494.78 --> 499.54999999999995
crab ler traces to

497.78 --> 504.85999999999996
and happens to be through my dad as well

499.55 --> 506.87
but it's yeah you know there's it's very

504.86 --> 511.06
tough to find somebody that doesn't have

506.87 --> 514.55
some gravel presented in them somewhere

511.06 --> 520.219
you know but I don't know my dad is not

514.55 --> 524.0899999999999
like that at all anyway that happened

520.219 --> 526.9100000000001
then I got on the panel and I had a

524.09 --> 529.4
really good and I don't even I think the

526.91 --> 533.51
guy was a baller but he was behaving

529.4 --> 536.54
very politely and reasonably so I like

533.51 --> 538.58
that and had a one-on-one with him for

536.54 --> 542.27
some time I think like half an hour at

538.58 --> 545.0200000000001
least and yeah he asked me about

542.27 --> 548.78
moonlight being cold and and dragon

545.02 --> 551.15
Antony Reilly's recent experiment with

548.78 --> 552.89
moonlight being cold and all that and

551.15 --> 558.92
asked me about like did I watch it well

552.89 --> 564.1999999999999
no I didn't because yeah like I have my

558.92 --> 567.8299999999999
own ideas on how to really test what

564.2 --> 569.96
this perceived cold or cooling effect is

567.83 --> 573.6500000000001
that comes with moonlight interaction

569.96 --> 576.32
and yeah we talked about that probably

573.65 --> 579.5
the most detailed conversation I've ever

576.32 --> 585.71
had about the subject so it was actually

579.5 --> 588.04
kind of good guys so yeah I wouldn't it

585.71 --> 591.02
was worth it like Jose's show yesterday

588.04 --> 593.24
the first part of it I was in it and

591.02 --> 595.79
it's really worth listening to it was

593.24 --> 600.65
actually kind of good but after that

595.79 --> 602.9499999999999
yeah Jose has apparently initiated a

600.65 --> 607.49
membership system with certain type of

602.95 --> 610.22
perks and one of them is that apparently

607.49 --> 614.839
he's loud like main members bigger

610.22 --> 619.57
members to call like a panel band card

614.839 --> 624.62
so Sean Hawkins actually spent his

619.57 --> 627.62
baller boomer money on Jose to get me

624.62 --> 628.73
banned from his panel and Jose oblige so

627.62 --> 631.01
for no reason

628.73 --> 633.86
but the conversation was over those

631.01 --> 635.6899999999999
so really didn't mind too much but he

633.86 --> 639.77
just banned me and Sean was all

635.69 --> 642.0500000000001
squirting in chat like yes yes my money

639.77 --> 643.4
does something it's worth all everything

642.05 --> 646.4
I did in my life

643.4 --> 648.3199999999999
it's all worth it now because he could

646.4 --> 652.1899999999999
use his money to make how they banned me

648.32 --> 655.61
from panel and actually I thought that

652.19 --> 659.12
was very very hilarious anyway sad and

655.61 --> 666.32
hilarious and it just left after that so

659.12 --> 668.33
yeah Sean Hawkins he's yep said he

666.32 --> 674.69
thought Cosentino that's pretty much the

668.33 --> 680.8100000000001
gist of it but yeah that happens

674.69 --> 682.46
it's just silly you know I don't know

680.81 --> 689.93
how much it cost him I think probably

682.46 --> 693.47
like $20 or something but you know the

689.93 --> 696.53
thing is Jose who is kind of sad about

693.47 --> 699.98
it for good reason because I was on his

696.53 --> 701.9599999999999
panel crushing it like he knew like oh

699.98 --> 709.91
this is really good and then Sean

701.96 --> 713.69
Hawkins made him kick me and Sean was

709.91 --> 716.24
all delighted over that but Jose knew

713.69 --> 718.22
that he was basically just shooting

716.24 --> 722.63
himself over the foot for a couple of

718.22 --> 726.4100000000001
boomer nickels so yeah you know maybe

722.63 --> 729.53
he'll reconsider his system because this

726.41 --> 732.92
way his show is eventually going to take

729.53 --> 738.8
turn into a baller safe space with this

732.92 --> 739.9699999999999
rule system but this is a soft it's his

738.8 --> 743.15
problem you know he did it

739.97 --> 747.0500000000001
it's his literally his contract he made

743.15 --> 748.43
it now has to deal with it I wonder if

747.05 --> 750.56
he realized the long-term consequences

748.43 --> 752.7099999999999
of that contract that he made for

750.56 --> 752.7099999999999
himself

756.87 --> 763.569
okay Jeffrey Billy that's not a real

759.49 --> 768.25
Jeffrey bill I think and if it is you're

763.569 --> 770.069
getting a timeout anyway yeah yeah Eric

768.25 --> 777.699
Dubay Sivan yay

770.069 --> 780.8789999999999
right if you dis Eric Dubay what's the

777.699 --> 784.029
problem with that you know people this

780.879 --> 786.4590000000001
on mark Sargent people on this on me the

784.029 --> 790.629
people dis on Nathan okie people dis on

786.459 --> 795.91
QE people this on everyone you know so

790.629 --> 798.149
why would they sing Eric Dubay prove

795.91 --> 802.8389999999999
you're a fake

798.149 --> 805.379
unless you are a savant a like the

802.839 --> 809.86
classic version the original one

805.379 --> 812.879
Jeffery bill hmm so I certainly hope

809.86 --> 812.879
that's not you

816.25 --> 820.84
then again it might be you I think I

818.74 --> 823.63
remember taking away your wrench the

820.84 --> 830.35
other day because you said just some

823.63 --> 836.67
things that just didn't feel right don't

830.35 --> 836.6700000000001
know what's going on there but yeah

841.5 --> 847.03
[Music]

843.36 --> 851.29
right yeah and hi Tom Parker it's okay

847.03 --> 854.17
dude you were working you know working

851.29 --> 857.98
for income so yeah I'm not gonna blame

854.17 --> 860.53
you for not being there and it was like

857.98 --> 862.6
an expected time I just thought I don't

860.53 --> 864.91
I'd I want to do it I just wanted to do

862.6 --> 866.5600000000001
it I had the energy good servant really

864.91 --> 867.5799999999999
wanted it so I just thought okay I'm

866.56 --> 870.13
just gonna do it now

867.58 --> 874.33
and yeah would it be nice if you'd be

870.13 --> 887.59
there but you weren't so no problem you

874.33 --> 889.45
know I'll be back okay yeah right so

887.59 --> 892.24
after that there was oh yeah there was a

889.45 --> 894.6400000000001
really early Owen Benjamin and then a

892.24 --> 898.39
really early second own Benjamin that

894.64 --> 903.22
was weird he was like was it really

898.39 --> 903.97
earthy no no yeah there was an earthy Oh

903.22 --> 907.57
Benjamin

903.97 --> 910.09
it was very short though very short and

907.57 --> 912.22
then he came back like at a very unusual

910.09 --> 915.2800000000001
time he said so he talked about it

912.22 --> 918.52
himself was like around twelve o'clock

915.28 --> 921.91
for me it was great so I wasn't like

918.52 --> 923.8299999999999
half asleep yet which is what happens

921.91 --> 925.8399999999999
normally when he starts streaming which

923.83 --> 928.72
is three hours later or something three

925.84 --> 932.82
or four hours later from that but yeah I

928.72 --> 932.82
was really crushing it again

935.63 --> 945.3
this new guy chili on Nathan's show

940.95 --> 947.4300000000001
recently we are so rich which new

945.3 --> 950.51
there's all kinds of new people on the

947.43 --> 955.4399999999999
show there's this Dutch guy and this I

950.51 --> 957.99
don't know what is he from Chile I don't

955.44 --> 959.7600000000001
know this is definitely dead one guy's

957.99 --> 962.7
definitely Dutch that came on I think he

959.76 --> 967.17
came on yesterday as a baller really

962.7 --> 969.1500000000001
embarrassing personally for me it's like

967.17 --> 973.31
can't stand it every time I hear that

969.15 --> 981.93
clearly Dutch people be like that yeah

973.31 --> 983.9599999999999
anyway does anyone notice the light and

981.93 --> 990.9
lights in the sky

983.96 --> 994.02
nope unless you mean the Stars nothing

990.9 --> 996.36
really special caught my eye might have

994.02 --> 998.37
been something around you know but when

996.36 --> 1000.98
I see like an usually bright star

998.37 --> 1004.04
somewhere I usually just assume they're

1000.98 --> 1006.71
planets because that turns out to be the

1004.04 --> 1009.02
case most of the time there's like an

1006.71 --> 1011.5600000000001
especially bright star so it usually

1009.02 --> 1015.22
turns out to be a planet or something a

1011.56 --> 1015.2199999999999
wandering star that is

1017.1 --> 1028.68
Oh Missouri bear let's just yeah Shawn

1022.47 --> 1032.51
just has a you know it's just a a baller

1028.68 --> 1032.51
boomer boner on for him

1034.37 --> 1041.1899999999998
Shawn is like the the the class in the

1039.0 --> 1042.93
kidding class that just refuses to

1041.19 --> 1045.15
behave and nathan is like the ultimate

1042.93 --> 1048.27
strict teacher that doesn't take that

1045.15 --> 1050.5800000000002
[ __ ] so I probably think that Nathan

1048.27 --> 1055.23
triggers Shawn Hawkins in if on a very

1050.58 --> 1057.33
personal visceral level reminding him a

1055.23 --> 1064.56
lot of situations he was in when he was

1057.33 --> 1069.1799999999998
younger I think that is really it but

1064.56 --> 1071.97
then again you know Shawn Shawn is like

1069.18 --> 1074.1000000000001
that with a lot of people but yeah

1071.97 --> 1077.33
Nathan Nathan especially triggers him

1074.1 --> 1077.33
but that's logical

1086.31 --> 1094.69
are you sure about that duster do 68 I

1091.23 --> 1097.24
don't know that's true I think you

1094.69 --> 1101.79
probably could don't care to personally

1097.24 --> 1101.79
find out but I think you probably could

1104.92 --> 1111.3400000000001
well mother Salim yeah secret admirer

1108.52 --> 1113.8899999999999
well this it is very similar to having a

1111.34 --> 1116.32
crush you know you know the old saying

1113.89 --> 1119.5300000000002
when you're a girl and a guy starts to

1116.32 --> 1123.1899999999998
tease you it's probably because they

1119.53 --> 1125.79
think you're attractive so yeah there's

1123.19 --> 1128.3200000000002
probably something to it you know people

1125.79 --> 1130.47
when people get triggered by somebody

1128.32 --> 1133.1499999999999
there's a personal reason for that

1130.47 --> 1136.39
because there is probably something

1133.15 --> 1138.49
really appealing and appalling about

1136.39 --> 1141.1000000000001
those people to the one getting

1138.49 --> 1143.95
triggered it's usually what that is yeah

1141.1 --> 1146.85
you could call it a man crush maybe no a

1143.95 --> 1151.18
lots of lots of men get man man crush

1146.85 --> 1154.05
it's actually kind of normal people just

1151.18 --> 1159.64
don't know how to deal with it anymore

1154.05 --> 1163.0
because now everything is gay or thought

1159.64 --> 1168.75
up as gay people just don't have the

1163.0 --> 1168.75
senses to deal with it normally anymore

1170.7 --> 1177.55
penis is going down in the late night

1173.41 --> 1184.9
sky very right okay misery bear so so

1177.55 --> 1187.6599999999999
fitness is going around okay yes we have

1184.9 --> 1192.2800000000002
a well we have have you ever had a

1187.66 --> 1196.72
serious relationship you know what

1192.28 --> 1199.54
happens to the one you've been very in

1196.72 --> 1204.1200000000001
love with and they with you what happens

1199.54 --> 1209.68
when it goes really sour and it breaks

1204.12 --> 1213.84
what happens after that yeah that's

1209.68 --> 1218.02
right most most people and end up

1213.84 --> 1220.98
despising their acts they hate him why

1218.02 --> 1224.34
is that because hatred unanswered love

1220.98 --> 1224.34
so yeah

1227.98 --> 1231.46
[Music]

1234.84 --> 1241.6499999999999
Shawn probably I let now I'm now

1238.87 --> 1243.82
spitballing wild guessing webfinger work

1241.65 --> 1247.18
could be something to it but Shawn

1243.82 --> 1249.58
probably just wishes really hard that

1247.18 --> 1251.89
Nathan was like the ultimate baller

1249.58 --> 1256.24
teacher and that he would have that

1251.89 --> 1258.3400000000001
technical power for the ball that not

1256.24 --> 1261.31
that that's possible but he just wants

1258.34 --> 1265.54
that to be the reality and he can't

1261.31 --> 1268.3
handle that it's not like that it might

1265.54 --> 1275.08
actually this whole Drive might actually

1268.3 --> 1277.69
just be as I know as basic and disc on

1275.08 --> 1281.4099999999999
tarted with reality as exactly that

1277.69 --> 1283.68
exactly that what I just described who

1281.41 --> 1283.68
knows

1297.44 --> 1305.5700000000002
right anyway let's continue

1300.88 --> 1313.22
alright so Benjamin oh yeah I remember

1305.57 --> 1316.7
now then I went over to broke ways again

1313.22 --> 1319.91
there's another presentation about just

1316.7 --> 1322.07
a subject she has a lot she's a real

1319.91 --> 1325.0700000000002
professional but then I caught her

1322.07 --> 1328.61
saying something that that really did

1325.07 --> 1329.96
not sit well with me at all and I kind

1328.61 --> 1337.1599999999999
of asked her and she had to correct

1329.96 --> 1340.58
herself and she didn't so that was kind

1337.16 --> 1347.78
of disappointing and I think it's

1340.58 --> 1350.03
probably personal but yeah

1347.78 --> 1352.7
the day I'm gonna take that as a warning

1350.03 --> 1358.55
sign and she was talking at first about

1352.7 --> 1361.49
like how society had basically caused

1358.55 --> 1367.1299999999999
the degeneration of the the proper use

1361.49 --> 1370.7
of sex and sexuality how sexuality is

1367.13 --> 1377.39
magical but it is a magic of procreation

1370.7 --> 1381.8
really it's a magic built into us by God

1377.39 --> 1385.91
that is extremely unique but it is there

1381.8 --> 1388.58
it's like a gift for procreation it's a

1385.91 --> 1391.03
gift that helps you build and you can

1388.58 --> 1395.53
there is like very interesting things

1391.03 --> 1399.17
concerning that and I've like I thrive

1395.53 --> 1401.21
with like really sexual sexuality and

1399.17 --> 1405.89
love because there is a magic to it and

1401.21 --> 1409.4
I know how to use it I always have I was

1405.89 --> 1412.48
born with that so did my mother she kind

1409.4 --> 1415.48
of didn't use it too well fortunately

1412.48 --> 1415.48
but

1415.51 --> 1425.08
yeah then it started to talk about like

1419.169 --> 1427.3890000000001
pregnancy and she yeah she said yeah I'm

1425.08 --> 1431.559
gonna say it you know don't really wanna

1427.389 --> 1436.12
but she said that technically a fetus is

1431.559 --> 1439.389
a parasite to to the mother's body and

1436.12 --> 1442.36
that just did not sit well with me and

1439.389 --> 1446.049
it's wrong it's very wrong cuz it's not

1442.36 --> 1449.62
a parasite parasite brings no advantages

1446.049 --> 1452.8799999999999
no nothing it's just just feeding and

1449.62 --> 1456.8799999999999
that's not the case because fetus

1452.88 --> 1460.5700000000002
provides a whole range of unique

1456.88 --> 1464.019
properties and abilities for which the

1460.57 --> 1468.61
body is specifically designed and so

1464.019 --> 1473.98
it's a symbiosis it's a symbiosis not a

1468.61 --> 1476.9189999999999
parasite and I told her in chat in all

1473.98 --> 1479.95
the chat like you have to correct this

1476.919 --> 1482.6200000000001
oh or I will not forget it's not a

1479.95 --> 1485.74
parasite it's a symbiosis technically

1482.62 --> 1491.62
you are wrong this is wrong this feels

1485.74 --> 1494.71
like a hidden liberal trait and it's bad

1491.62 --> 1496.87
and she didn't correct it maybe she

1494.71 --> 1499.69
overlooked it maybe she doesn't want to

1496.87 --> 1502.6299999999999
correct herself ever and she'll just not

1499.69 --> 1505.5900000000001
say that again but I take notice of that

1502.63 --> 1507.909
[ __ ] because I'm a freaking paladin I

1505.59 --> 1510.9089999999999
didn't take notice of everything

1507.909 --> 1511.72
you cannot sneak through [ __ ] like that

1510.909 --> 1514.0900000000001
ever

1511.72 --> 1515.919
if you intended to whether you did that

1514.09 --> 1518.6789999999999
consciously or whether that's like the

1515.919 --> 1519.429
beast dipping a finger in or whatever

1518.679 --> 1523.5700000000002
that is

1519.429 --> 1528.8990000000001
I noticed that fetuses are not parasites

1523.57 --> 1528.899
they're symbols that's what they are

1528.9 --> 1535.52
so just I needed to say that you know I

1532.41 --> 1555.1200000000001
really like her work and she is very

1535.52 --> 1560.1299999999999
ambitious she does a lot okay okay thank

1555.12 --> 1561.4499999999998
God I'm back I was just in time the same

1560.13 --> 1564.72
thing as yesterday happened but I was

1561.45 --> 1567.39
just in the nick of time of recognizing

1564.72 --> 1569.34
that the video got stuck so I reset my

1567.39 --> 1573.95
internet no note part two it's still the

1569.34 --> 1580.5
same yes you can't split my hangouts

1573.95 --> 1588.0900000000001
Internet it's not the devil it's the

1580.5 --> 1596.82
Internet don't don't ever say that if

1588.09 --> 1599.82
it's the devil I'll tell you okay it's

1596.82 --> 1602.79
just my internet connection it it's not

1599.82 --> 1607.29
even the Internet the internet is what

1602.79 --> 1608.82
happens beyond the hub that leads into

1607.29 --> 1610.86
the wider system this is just

1608.82 --> 1613.95
technically the wire

1610.86 --> 1616.1399999999999
from my computer to the hub that is the

1613.95 --> 1618.57
thing that is disrupting not the

1616.14 --> 1622.47
Internet is not Satan it's just

1618.57 --> 1628.46
technology that's has some flaws at

1622.47 --> 1628.46
times that's all that's all

1632.12 --> 1638.9099999999999
yeah it's maybe it's maybe it it's like

1635.91 --> 1641.43
a little thingamajig that is trying to

1638.91 --> 1644.13
say oh come on are we you this never

1641.43 --> 1648.18
happens with Wi-Fi just go Wireless it's

1644.13 --> 1650.6100000000001
so easy as well the entire world around

1648.18 --> 1655.2
me has been trying to do that since the

1650.61 --> 1657.1799999999998
beginning like forever friends like

1655.2 --> 1660.51
looked at me like you don't like

1657.18 --> 1664.49
Wireless what are you so 20th century

1660.51 --> 1669.51
like that [ __ ] no never

1664.49 --> 1671.7
wireless is bad and I will never use it

1669.51 --> 1676.5
if I have any other option available to

1671.7 --> 1680.48
me so this works just fine but the

1676.5 --> 1680.48
internet connects disconnect sometimes

1691.83 --> 1699.4299999999998
okay david kaye maybe you should stop

1697.45 --> 1701.73
being a little bit silly your drones

1699.43 --> 1706.5700000000002
don't prove the earth is not flat

1701.73 --> 1709.3600000000001
there is no geometrical horizon right in

1706.57 --> 1714.1899999999998
the real world and the geometrical

1709.36 --> 1717.7199999999998
horizon could not be refracted because

1714.19 --> 1719.02
there is only one horizon and it is an

1717.72 --> 1723.76
effect

1719.02 --> 1726.19
you can't refract the effect that's a

1723.76 --> 1730.93
contradiction in term because the

1726.19 --> 1733.68
horizon itself is an effect so it can't

1730.93 --> 1736.66
refract it doesn't make any sense

1733.68 --> 1737.38
how does GPS on works drones what's very

1736.66 --> 1739.8100000000002
simple

1737.38 --> 1743.1100000000001
there's triangulation with towers or

1739.81 --> 1747.19
SATA loons or whatever is out there you

1743.11 --> 1750.6699999999998
know and then that information is

1747.19 --> 1752.56
relayed on a map and that map can I

1750.67 --> 1754.3300000000002
don't know be twisted and turned into a

1752.56 --> 1756.1599999999999
globe or into whatever type of

1754.33 --> 1759.1
projection you want to use for that map

1756.16 --> 1760.9
in order for you to presuppose the shape

1759.1 --> 1761.26
of the earth to be whatever the [ __ ] you

1760.9 --> 1765.2800000000002
want

1761.26 --> 1768.18
okay how about that that's what your GPS

1765.28 --> 1768.18
proves david kay

1777.93 --> 1786.8700000000001
right and of course there's that you're

1781.66 --> 1786.8700000000001
off foot indeed

1800.53 --> 1803.53
okay

1829.02 --> 1836.52
okay well that's shut up david kaye very

1831.6 --> 1839.25
quickly ah almost disappointed

1836.52 --> 1840.72
has no rebuttal to that but yeah he

1839.25 --> 1848.46
shouldn't have because there is no

1840.72 --> 1853.429
rebuttal do that really is that true

1848.46 --> 1853.429
that's studio 68 that's interesting

1858.28 --> 1863.26
how far is the range then on the average

1860.92 --> 1868.14
tower I don't know I don't know what the

1863.26 --> 1868.14
average tower range is I just know that

1868.71 --> 1879.49
radiology based technology right it has

1875.17 --> 1883.72
advanced massively massively in the last

1879.49 --> 1885.91
hundred years like insanely well so well

1883.72 --> 1888.25
that they have actually you've managed

1885.91 --> 1892.63
to figure out how to use parts of it for

1888.25 --> 1896.05
direct mines thought alteration mood

1892.63 --> 1897.94
swings and even just instant death if

1896.05 --> 1900.55
they wanted to not saying that they do

1897.94 --> 1902.77
or that is standard procedure in this

1900.55 --> 1907.03
technology just say that they figured it

1902.77 --> 1910.27
out that well okay so what what's to say

1907.03 --> 1913.96
that they're the they couldn't get

1910.27 --> 1917.8
enough range really really so how about

1913.96 --> 1921.1000000000001
the Lorenz system which was like one of

1917.8 --> 1927.43
the first things that could reach it

1921.1 --> 1928.0
could reach like over a thousand miles I

1927.43 --> 1931.9
think

1928.0 --> 1935.49
transatlantic right right so what is

1931.9 --> 1940.3300000000002
this range problem you speak of

1935.49 --> 1944.73
concerning towers or isn't thousands of

1940.33 --> 1944.73
miles in Africa you know

1946.11 --> 1952.9599999999998
[Music]

1948.52 --> 1952.96
thank you for trying and getting my way

1962.759 --> 1968.83
the good servant you don't even know if

1965.95 --> 1969.82
they are part of that system we know set

1968.83 --> 1972.1589999999999
looms exist

1969.82 --> 1976.359
we don't know however what they're used

1972.159 --> 1980.769
for we really don't okay

1976.359 --> 1982.6589999999999
don't slip into just assuming that

1980.769 --> 1985.21
settle ins are a standard part of

1982.659 --> 1988.21
everything we don't know there is no

1985.21 --> 1990.6390000000001
proof for this at all you don't know

1988.21 --> 1992.729
what the settle ins literally are being

1990.639 --> 1995.9189999999999
used for we just know they're out there

1992.729 --> 1999.3690000000001
that's all okay let's be clear about

1995.919 --> 2001.919
that what we do know is they are

1999.369 --> 2008.129
technically superfluous for a GPS

2001.919 --> 2010.409
technology they are you don't need them

2008.129 --> 2016.83
you could use them but you don't need

2010.409 --> 2020.5800000000002
them so there is no necessity for any

2016.83 --> 2023.399
kind of signal relay even up there it's

2020.58 --> 2027.379
no necessity for it whatsoever for the

2023.399 --> 2027.379
current level of technology we have now

2029.51 --> 2036.1589999999999
[Music]

2032.679 --> 2036.159
white pigeons

2058.349 --> 2061.159
all right

2068.96 --> 2074.389
so that is really interesting your oh

2070.97 --> 2076.5499999999997
[ __ ] that is that is so cool that that

2074.389 --> 2080.03
that that option was available for you

2076.55 --> 2082.19
to stir it study the Lorenz system in a

2080.03 --> 2085.7900000000004
technical sense that is really cool man

2082.19 --> 2088.01
you should you should do like an

2085.79 --> 2090.349
elaborate video about that about that

2088.01 --> 2093.3790000000004
study about the material that was made

2090.349 --> 2096.01
available for you to study that I'm

2093.379 --> 2100.5789999999997
serious I want and I want to see that an

2096.01 --> 2102.1090000000004
official study oh hey Thank You Amanda

2100.579 --> 2105.38
young for the five-dollar super chair

2102.109 --> 2107.39
donation also I see you've given me

2105.38 --> 2109.4900000000002
something on paper also I got an ax I

2107.39 --> 2112.8489999999997
noticed after the show yesterday I had a

2109.49 --> 2116.089
paypal from someone else as well so I'm

2112.849 --> 2121.6400000000003
gonna shut that out let me get in there

2116.089 --> 2124.8089999999997
oh wow

2121.64 --> 2132.71
Thank You Amanda young 20 euros Wow

2124.809 --> 2135.4100000000003
thank you so much yeah I got I got 21

2132.71 --> 2138.41
euros yesterday also from Hanna's I

2135.41 --> 2141.25
think that's an ekala thank you so much

2138.41 --> 2144.25
had a koala that's that's awesome an

2141.25 --> 2144.25
girl

2151.87 --> 2162.54
yeah that's really appreciate all the

2156.22 --> 2167.4399999999996
donations really I feel like a very very

2162.54 --> 2171.12
wealthy man with such loyal viewers I'm

2167.44 --> 2174.52
serious I think that with the relatively

2171.12 --> 2177.7
low digit number of income that I'm

2174.52 --> 2181.42
getting from all you and I don't know my

2177.7 --> 2184.1499999999996
show I have here I think I feel probably

2181.42 --> 2186.76
a lot more wealthy than the average

2184.15 --> 2187.2400000000002
millionaire I'm serious I'm not even

2186.76 --> 2193.8
joking

2187.24 --> 2197.29
I probably experience more wealth like

2193.8 --> 2200.1400000000003
the joy of the and the feeling and the

2197.29 --> 2201.73
idea of wealth more than the average

2200.14 --> 2204.19
millionaire I'm not joking

2201.73 --> 2206.95
because if you're an average millionaire

2204.19 --> 2208.9900000000002
and you got that million well guess what

2206.95 --> 2211.18
you're gonna spend a lot of time

2208.99 --> 2214.0899999999997
figuring out how to not lose that

2211.18 --> 2216.3399999999997
million and you're gonna get tied into

2214.09 --> 2218.08
things you're gonna push yourself to go

2216.34 --> 2219.94
over certain boundaries you probably

2218.08 --> 2223.9
don't want to go over in order to

2219.94 --> 2229.48
achieve that so do you really feel that

2223.9 --> 2233.65
wealthy when you're a millionaire or do

2229.48 --> 2236.23
you feel more like the the beast out

2233.65 --> 2240.04
there is pulling your treasure away

2236.23 --> 2244.68
right cuz I don't feel like that I feel

2240.04 --> 2248.56
actually wealthier just from the

2244.68 --> 2251.14
donations I'm getting here which on the

2248.56 --> 2253.66
grand scale of things is yes just

2251.14 --> 2255.58
pennies but yeah for you guys it's

2253.66 --> 2258.2799999999997
probably a lot so thank you so much and

2255.58 --> 2261.13
for me it is technically a lot too it

2258.28 --> 2264.75
matters a lot so thank you so much I

2261.13 --> 2264.75
feel very blessed with you guys

2268.52 --> 2272.66
David K what did you say

2273.68 --> 2277.56
yet you didn't need to time them out for

2276.33 --> 2280.38
that it's so silly

2277.56 --> 2283.17
it's so silly to say that it's you

2280.38 --> 2286.29
should just leave something like that

2283.17 --> 2288.59
because it's so silly David K before it

2286.29 --> 2294.05
got timed out by George Sanford said

2288.59 --> 2296.9700000000003
don't drone GPS is flat earth destroyed

2294.05 --> 2299.28
mmm of course after all the

2296.97 --> 2301.56
argumentation and data we just discussed

2299.28 --> 2307.2000000000003
that is the sensible conclusion right

2301.56 --> 2311.57
people right right know that that's

2307.2 --> 2319.8599999999997
called a hands wave dismissal and a

2311.57 --> 2322.23
repeated blind assertion yeah and yeah I

2319.86 --> 2325.71
know most of you are very very familiar

2322.23 --> 2329.6
with that it happens a lot in the flat

2325.71 --> 2329.6
earth versus ball scene

2342.18 --> 2349.72
ok-hee have it and what middle of

2344.89 --> 2356.3799999999997
nowhere was that were they in between

2349.72 --> 2358.87
mountain ranges or just fast fast

2356.38 --> 2366.1800000000003
distance like over a desert or something

2358.87 --> 2370.69
you know okay towers can reach very far

2366.18 --> 2372.0699999999997
radio towers they really can because

2370.69 --> 2375.54
there's a direct line is like you know

2372.07 --> 2380.38
wide because there's no geometrical

2375.54 --> 2384.4
sphere edge to obstruct the direct

2380.38 --> 2385.9300000000003
signal because the earth is flat so the

2384.4 --> 2388.87
only thing that's really gonna obstruct

2385.93 --> 2396.75
the signal is something like a mountain

2388.87 --> 2396.75
range right - simple as that

2400.49 --> 2406.3999999999996
somewhere in Afghanistan okay okay Oh

2403.7 --> 2409.16
Afghanistan is also very mountainous

2406.4 --> 2412.57
area so yeah that might be a typical

2409.16 --> 2416.18
place where there may be some trouble

2412.57 --> 2419.21
with that but then again you know

2416.18 --> 2420.589
especially considering the US military

2419.21 --> 2427.76
operations that have been happening

2420.589 --> 2430.31
there it's I'd guess that if they have

2427.76 --> 2434.05
some kind of GPS even in between the

2430.31 --> 2438.41
mountains there it's probably due to a

2434.05 --> 2443.54
settle on you GPS or high altitude

2438.41 --> 2446.5699999999997
Zeppelin or maybe just a flying circling

2443.54 --> 2449.98
drone with the GPS relay built into it

2446.57 --> 2453.0800000000004
you know it's all kinds of solutions

2449.98 --> 2456.2
temporary solutions because yeah

2453.08 --> 2459.38
building a radio tower in Afghanistan on

2456.2 --> 2460.58
a mountain yeah duh everyone's gonna

2459.38 --> 2462.23
take notice of that and they're gonna

2460.58 --> 2464.06
know odd stuff that just African

2462.23 --> 2468.07
Americans again and then they're gonna

2464.06 --> 2470.66
try to blow it up of course you know

2468.07 --> 2473.9300000000003
well yeah the hostiles that is they be

2470.66 --> 2479.0299999999997
what is it the Taliban are there right

2473.93 --> 2481.52
so yeah building a tower you could do

2479.03 --> 2485.03
that on a heavily guarded base and all

2481.52 --> 2487.88
that but yeah in difficult to gain

2485.03 --> 2490.7000000000003
territories within mountain ranges they

2487.88 --> 2495.02
probably have some temporary system to

2490.7 --> 2502.0099999999998
provide yeah a temporary relay for this

2495.02 --> 2505.13
type of coordination oh really

2502.01 --> 2507.2000000000003
so a really haba so you don't think they

2505.13 --> 2513.109
could have done something in secret

2507.2 --> 2516.2599999999998
maybe you know remember remember how the

2513.109 --> 2519.2
US typically has a lot of high-tech

2516.26 --> 2522.1400000000003
stuff that they use secretly and don't

2519.2 --> 2526.79
reveal until like a decade later and

2522.14 --> 2529.19
stuff why are you assuming that in in

2526.79 --> 2531.55
the year 2000 they didn't have anything

2529.19 --> 2531.55
like that

2535.82 --> 2544.7400000000002
you know I'm pretty sure they had

2541.14 --> 2549.7799999999997
Zeppelin's you know Zeppelin's have

2544.74 --> 2553.5299999999997
existed for over a hundred years so hey

2549.78 --> 2556.6800000000003
if there is radio tower technology like

2553.53 --> 2560.82
signaling if it exists and it has since

2556.68 --> 2564.96
the Lorenz system and Zeppelin's there

2560.82 --> 2567.96
you go to technologies over a hundred

2564.96 --> 2570.81
years old what do you do take a sample

2567.96 --> 2575.67
in you put a radio tower on the bottom

2570.81 --> 2580.14
of it this could have been done in

2575.67 --> 2580.41
secret for 100 a hundred years guys come

2580.14 --> 2582.8399999999997
on

2580.41 --> 2586.2599999999998
think about it if they don't tell you

2582.84 --> 2592.98
they don't tell you do they well duh

2586.26 --> 2595.6200000000003
right seeking star water so you know

2592.98 --> 2599.88
yeah could be drones well look the drone

2595.62 --> 2600.99
technology was mostly to take the human

2599.88 --> 2605.25
factor out of it

2600.99 --> 2608.04
and more for strikes but yeah of course

2605.25 --> 2610.41
drones now are also being double fitted

2608.04 --> 2614.34
for scanning equipment and potential

2610.41 --> 2621.29
communication and GPS relays so yes but

2614.34 --> 2625.8
drones were definitely not like quality

2621.29 --> 2627.6
updated manufactured back then it's

2625.8 --> 2631.34
really relatively a new industry I think

2627.6 --> 2635.24
the drones that we see you know but

2631.34 --> 2639.21
Zeppelin's were definitely already there

2635.24 --> 2641.2799999999997
it's not tough to to update that in I

2639.21 --> 2643.77
don't know in 80 years time to think of

2641.28 --> 2648.0600000000004
an updated version put a radio tower on

2643.77 --> 2649.86
that and use that in secret you know not

2648.06 --> 2655.0099999999998
saying that that is the way they did it

2649.86 --> 2655.01
I'm just saying that is possible so

2672.07 --> 2675.3300000000004
if I were Internet

2681.74 --> 2684.4599999999996
right

2694.9 --> 2699.839
whoa

2696.99 --> 2704.43
okay you're a [ __ ] that's that's an

2699.839 --> 2706.92
impressive price drop men so dropped in

2704.43 --> 2711.74
price like 45 times now that is

2706.92 --> 2711.7400000000002
industrial price reduction then Wow

2724.19 --> 2730.0
the 101 Rock'em yeah better late than

2727.94 --> 2730.0
never

2737.319 --> 2742.959
Oh Missouri bear look if the earth were

2741.219 --> 2744.759
actually spinning it would have to be a

2742.959 --> 2747.609
ball in a first instance which it isn't

2744.759 --> 2750.789
but if it were and it were spinning the

2747.609 --> 2754.779
consequences would be endless we would

2750.789 --> 2757.63
be reminded about it spin every single

2754.779 --> 2761.069
second we look outside because there

2757.63 --> 2763.8900000000003
would probably be persistent winds with

2761.069 --> 2767.529
more power or less power but

2763.89 --> 2772.5389999999998
persistently in a direction for always

2767.529 --> 2775.859
forever and there would be entirely

2772.539 --> 2778.5690000000004
different transportation systems devised

2775.859 --> 2781.269
because who's not gonna why would you

2778.569 --> 2784.209
need a plane when you can just have a

2781.269 --> 2786.069
giant balloon track that rides on the

2784.209 --> 2787.749
air current over the earth it just goes

2786.069 --> 2790.209
in the same direction just you hop on a

2787.749 --> 2793.0589999999997
balloon you wait and then you go down

2790.209 --> 2795.0589999999997
and if you want to go back east yeah

2793.059 --> 2797.199
yeah you take a little bit longer trip

2795.059 --> 2800.88
and you go around the world you know and

2797.199 --> 2803.65
if you want to go fast you go higher up

2800.88 --> 2807.4
that's how it would work on a spinning

2803.65 --> 2810.94
ball earth guess what it doesn't not

2807.4 --> 2814.69
even close no the earth is absolutely

2810.94 --> 2819.069
stationary because the endless

2814.69 --> 2822.849
consequences of a ball earth spin would

2819.069 --> 2824.979
be so evident as you would not be able

2822.849 --> 2827.199
to escape it in a second it would not be

2824.979 --> 2829.359
a matter of searching out an effect to

2827.199 --> 2832.449
prove it no it would be so blatantly

2829.359 --> 2834.819
present at all time and integrated in

2832.449 --> 2840.219
absolutely everything there would be no

2834.819 --> 2842.049
escape whatsoever to that fact but

2840.219 --> 2843.219
that's not how the world works that's

2842.049 --> 2845.2889999999998
not the reality

2843.219 --> 2847.709
so yeah the earth is definitely not

2845.289 --> 2847.7090000000003
spinning

2859.92 --> 2866.83
yeah defecate that's a complete

2862.51 --> 2869.17
strongman you're assigning you're

2866.83 --> 2871.42
assigning the technology to a specific

2869.17 --> 2874.96
bandwidth with limitations and all that

2871.42 --> 2876.88
yeah oh is that the problem is it well

2874.96 --> 2878.89
guess what that's not the type of signal

2876.88 --> 2881.7400000000002
then that they'll use that duh

2878.89 --> 2884.14
why are you straw Manning me with such a

2881.74 --> 2888.52
stupid little sneaky trick you think we

2884.14 --> 2891.67
don't catch on to that really radio

2888.52 --> 2894.39
triangulation a few hundred meters how

2891.67 --> 2900.76
is that gonna work with satellites buddy

2894.39 --> 2906.79
this is it you make no sense buddy you

2900.76 --> 2909.1600000000003
just don't make any sense this is just

2906.79 --> 2911.56
the this is just the same strum and [ __ ]

2909.16 --> 2915.73
that ballers do whenever they bring up

2911.56 --> 2918.5499999999997
the disk you know like oh look but this

2915.73 --> 2920.98
thing is impossible yeah well we don't

2918.55 --> 2923.44
use that's not going to be used then duh

2920.98 --> 2926.77
what do you think if it's impossible

2923.44 --> 2928.9900000000002
well it's working right it's not working

2926.77 --> 2930.52
because of your stupid satellites it's

2928.99 --> 2933.04
working because it's working

2930.52 --> 2934.93
oh if some signals not supposed to be

2933.04 --> 2936.25
working like that well guess what

2934.93 --> 2937.8599999999997
they're not going to use that type of

2936.25 --> 2949.21
signal then duh

2937.86 --> 2950.11
stop straw Manning it getting that David

2949.21 --> 2956.4
key

2950.11 --> 2956.4
[Music]

2980.13 --> 2984.05
I don't know what that means

3008.75 --> 3014.38
who is DJI I don't know who that is or

3014.53 --> 3017.8900000000003
what it is

3033.83 --> 3039.16
yeah anyway right

3047.65 --> 3050.25
who

3053.07 --> 3060.8900000000003
somebody's planning to go out and

3055.38 --> 3060.8900000000003
surfing into surfboards

3063.19 --> 3070.78
my brother do used to do a lot of that

3065.74 --> 3073.39
and I learn it too a little it's a long

3070.78 --> 3077.849
time since I've seen one of those in the

3073.39 --> 3077.8489999999997
real is my um your eyes

3092.45 --> 3094.48
Oh

3099.88 --> 3109.02
oh right drone manufacturer yep

3102.97 --> 3112.27
yes David K yeah the designers and the

3109.02 --> 3114.97
ones that actually make the decisions in

3112.27 --> 3117.64
that [ __ ] in those companies the the big

3114.97 --> 3119.98
corporations that do the super high-tech

3117.64 --> 3124.21
stuff especially involved in the

3119.98 --> 3129.72
military you bet your ass they know

3124.21 --> 3132.43
absolutely they do because they must

3129.72 --> 3136.6
they wouldn't be in that spot if they

3132.43 --> 3138.6099999999997
didn't doesn't mean that everybody in

3136.6 --> 3140.56
the company knows about everything that

3138.61 --> 3147.52
transpires concerning what they're

3140.56 --> 3150.9
working on right you bet that the top

3147.52 --> 3155.23
the decision makers the the planners did

3150.9 --> 3158.77
yeah they know oh yes they know they

3155.23 --> 3163.51
know the earth is flat then they know in

3158.77 --> 3169.5099999999998
how to abide to the upholding of the the

3163.51 --> 3172.6000000000004
globe lie and they do that probably

3169.51 --> 3175.7200000000003
because it's mandated for them to have

3172.6 --> 3178.06
that if they want to become like yeah

3175.72 --> 3179.83
want to maintain mega-corporation status

3178.06 --> 3183.19
and cooperations with the government and

3179.83 --> 3189.63
all that so yes yes they participate in

3183.19 --> 3189.63
upholding the globe lie that's right

3194.41 --> 3201.22
not saying that a guy that is like yeah

3197.619 --> 3207.9300000000003
I can make my own drones that he's in on

3201.22 --> 3211.41
it but yeah those big big mega Corp

3207.93 --> 3217.3799999999997
producers that do like military

3211.41 --> 3217.3799999999997
contracts and [ __ ] and yeah no duh

3233.76 --> 3236.869
[Music]

3267.99 --> 3275.6699999999996
yeah yeah how by the way I was thinking

3272.7 --> 3278.43
you know somebody brought up the ISS

3275.67 --> 3280.5
again and it's still somewhat of a

3278.43 --> 3282.54
mystery to me like what the those

3280.5 --> 3289.53
suppose it's sightings from the ground

3282.54 --> 3294.0
are of the ISS and I don't know it could

3289.53 --> 3296.46
be interesting I don't know see if you

3294.0 --> 3298.65
could prove our proximity to that

3296.46 --> 3305.52
phenomena to that visual of this what

3298.65 --> 3308.7000000000003
people think the ISS is like get a high

3305.52 --> 3311.869
altitude balloon or maybe a Zeppelin or

3308.7 --> 3316.47
something and then when it is said that

3311.869 --> 3318.48
the path of the ISS comes over that you

3316.47 --> 3320.97
get really high up in there really

3318.48 --> 3322.619
really high up as close as soon as the

3320.97 --> 3325.589
highest you can get without the thing

3322.619 --> 3329.4
bursting and then try to spot it from

3325.589 --> 3331.47
that position but what you see would it

3329.4 --> 3334.83
be the same kind of weird effects as

3331.47 --> 3337.22
well of the heavenly bodies like the

3334.83 --> 3341.25
moon becoming very small and all that

3337.22 --> 3343.3489999999997
would it not be in its correct angular

3341.25 --> 3346.38
position if it was supposed to be an

3343.349 --> 3352.17
object in a specific position just like

3346.38 --> 3354.2400000000002
the rest of the heavenly bodies or what

3352.17 --> 3357.15
it actually be some kind of weird

3354.24 --> 3360.33
physical object that somehow is floating

3357.15 --> 3365.13
up there I don't know I don't know don't

3360.33 --> 3367.38
know but it would be interesting to see

3365.13 --> 3369.54
but one thing I do know for sure

3367.38 --> 3371.1600000000003
whatever that thing is whether it's just

3369.54 --> 3373.38
a light phenomena that somehow

3371.16 --> 3375.6299999999997
artificially injected in there or a

3373.38 --> 3378.2400000000002
natural phenomena that's been that a

3375.63 --> 3380.76
legend has been built upon or that's an

3378.24 --> 3383.91
actual physical object that is there in

3380.76 --> 3387.0
some way I'm pretty sure it's not a

3383.91 --> 3394.56
space station and it's definitely not in

3387.0 --> 3398.28
a vacuum of space so yeah whatever that

3394.56 --> 3401.25
is that is exciting it's definitely not

3398.28 --> 3406.51
a space station with people in it

3401.25 --> 3410.56
floating or flying up there in a super

3406.51 --> 3418.9300000000003
low pressure system that's definitely

3410.56 --> 3420.73
not what that is because it it would

3418.93 --> 3423.3689999999997
just fall down you know there's no end

3420.73 --> 3425.47
to relative density relative density

3423.369 --> 3428.7400000000002
keeps working until in the entire realm

3425.47 --> 3431.2
there's no point at which this stops the

3428.74 --> 3433.5989999999997
only way to even apparently counter the

3431.2 --> 3436.0299999999997
effects of relative density is by

3433.599 --> 3436.75
accelerated motion to counteract the

3436.03 --> 3439.69
effects

3436.75 --> 3442.68
but yeah guess what you can do that in

3439.69 --> 3445.63
any other way than by accelerated motion

3442.68 --> 3451.21
see there is no point in which this

3445.63 --> 3453.73
effect of apparent zero-g actually

3451.21 --> 3456.04
happens when you stay in the same

3453.73 --> 3458.41
position there is no place in the realm

3456.04 --> 3460.619
where this can happen I'm pretty sure of

3458.41 --> 3460.6189999999997
it

3484.81 --> 3493.06
you think so II have I beg to differ

3488.67 --> 3496.63
just imagine how much less or how much

3493.06 --> 3501.91
less atmosphere will be in between

3496.63 --> 3506.19
technically 15 kilometers up I'm pretty

3501.91 --> 3510.97
damn sure you'll see it a lot clearer a

3506.19 --> 3515.86
lot clearer because you don't have to

3510.97 --> 3525.39
thick ground-level atmosphere to distort

3515.86 --> 3529.78
it this is yes Yuri have a few Falls

3525.39 --> 3533.62
yeah perpetual fall of course it's a

3529.78 --> 3535.09
really nice conceptual invention you

3533.62 --> 3538.3199999999997
know I think that the orbits and

3535.09 --> 3542.3500000000004
perpetual falling is very similar in the

3538.32 --> 3544.54
constructive train of thought as the

3542.35 --> 3547.06
Einstein in bending of space-time

3544.54 --> 3551.47
it's like who who came up with that a

3547.06 --> 3554.0499999999997
perpetual fall like did they derived it

3551.47 --> 3558.2799999999997
somebody's twisted mind take that out of

3554.05 --> 3562.1800000000003
the eternal falling pit and just thought

3558.28 --> 3565.8700000000003
yeah man the eternal falling pit we're

3562.18 --> 3568.2999999999997
gonna make that into an orbit around the

3565.87 --> 3572.38
earth and you're gonna fall forever so

3568.3 --> 3576.07
what guy came up with that oh we do know

3572.38 --> 3579.88
who came up with that but like what must

3576.07 --> 3585.4
have gone through his head when he

3579.88 --> 3587.11
thought that up anyway I'm gonna round

3585.4 --> 3590.26
out the show because it's 3 o'clock now

3587.11 --> 3592.1200000000003
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

3590.26 --> 3594.34
enjoyed this show I certainly did I

3592.12 --> 3595.87
thought it was a great show today and if

3594.34 --> 3597.7000000000003
you like to show them please don't

3595.87 --> 3599.0499999999997
forget to Rogen's it up and if you

3597.7 --> 3600.7

will be back tomorrow with letter Thor

3641.73 --> 3645.84
the good number 512 and I'm going to

3644.04 --> 3650.4
join the Flat Earth debates right after

3645.84 --> 3652.98
this so I should take me five course

3650.4 --> 3657.02
Steve and Oberman cool till the next

3652.98 --> 3657.02
video keep it flat
