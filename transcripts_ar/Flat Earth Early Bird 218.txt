6.88 --> 36.959
[Music]

38.03 --> 45.84
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.0 --> 47.61
early-bird number 118 I'm your host

45.84 --> 49.53
Arwen and before we start the show

47.61 --> 53.28
please don't forget to share it on any

49.53 --> 54.72
platform you deem fit and also if you

53.28 --> 56.729
haven't already subscribed to my channel

54.72 --> 58.62
and hit the bell notification so you

56.729 --> 61.17
know when I'm going live which is

58.62 --> 67.369
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

61.17 --> 67.369
day so yeah also please support my show

67.429 --> 77.539
the weather today well right now it's

70.74 --> 77.539
yeah little cloud but my god it's hot

79.759 --> 84.369
like especially when this in when the

82.219 --> 87.11
Sun hits it's just so hot it's almost

84.369 --> 93.32
hard to breathe but and again I still

87.11 --> 96.38
have some like the cold issue it's still

93.32 --> 98.96
there weirdly enough it's like the start

96.38 --> 102.14
like this part is completely gone then

98.96 --> 105.88999999999999
it just slowly migrated downwards and it

102.14 --> 108.86
seems like it's now really like working

105.89 --> 112.149
its way to the tip of my lungs which is

108.86 --> 115.22
kind of annoying and typically again I

112.149 --> 119.72
get back problems and that is extremely

115.22 --> 122.179
annoying but I know that that is usually

119.72 --> 126.259
like if this is this prolonged process

122.179 --> 133.61
that the final stage and after that it

126.259 --> 136.25
tends to be over for a long time so but

133.61 --> 139.06
yeah it's so hot here I don't know it

136.25 --> 142.25
feels like it could be like a 40 degrees

139.06 --> 145.489
Celsius or something probably not that

142.25 --> 149.66
hot but it's also kind of moist so yeah

145.489 --> 153.5
today with me I got tumeric coffee and

149.66 --> 155.65
tea and a nap really looking forward to

153.5 --> 155.65
this

157.99 --> 161.05
[Music]

162.239 --> 165.239
what

173.26 --> 176.129
all right

178.47 --> 181.28
okay

181.52 --> 190.56
so let's see yeah I I'm gonna be

188.61 --> 193.98000000000002
flustered probably like a lot like

190.56 --> 197.34
certainly slowing down doing nothing and

193.98 --> 200.94
just staring ahead because it's that

197.34 --> 205.41
warm so pardon me if I just suddenly

200.94 --> 209.1
seem to like grind to a standstill for

205.41 --> 210.85999999999999
some reason the heat will be the primary

209.1 --> 219.35
reason

210.86 --> 219.35000000000002
let's see what's been happening

221.47 --> 228.22
I watched another Netflix movie I

225.03 --> 230.32
remember that part and was such

228.22 --> 234.18
programming just insane

230.32 --> 240.91
I should almost review it just for that

234.18 --> 247.54000000000002
oh yeah lift the veil again talking

240.91 --> 251.82999999999998
about YouTube censorship and it seems to

247.54 --> 254.26
be pretty it's getting urgent so yeah

251.83 --> 261.37
we're gonna have to scramble pretty much

254.26 --> 265.45
with this one and so do I I'll figure it

261.37 --> 267.52
out at least one of the things that out

265.45 --> 274.0
well I already have all my flatter talks

267.52 --> 275.65
download it and on on CD on DVD and I

274.0 --> 277.24
think I'm gonna have to start

275.65 --> 281.02
downloading all the flatter the early

277.24 --> 283.15000000000003
words as well and then see ya if what

281.02 --> 289.35999999999996
other places I can basically upload it

283.15 --> 291.54999999999995
and then have it displayed and then

289.36 --> 295.53000000000003
start streaming on those platforms and

291.55 --> 297.91
see how that works out and again I'm the

295.53 --> 301.03
yeah the old news I'm gonna need

297.91 --> 304.03000000000003
finances for this like even more than

301.03 --> 307.38
for just getting a camera or something

304.03 --> 314.16999999999996
because yeah some of these platforms

307.38 --> 315.46999999999997
tend to not completely be free I don't

314.17 --> 318.56
know

315.47 --> 321.02000000000004
I'll figure it out at least yeah I have

318.56 --> 324.47
been getting some support by followers

321.02 --> 328.09999999999997
and I that's very encouraging already

324.47 --> 332.23
set said that earlier like way earlier

328.1 --> 335.12
like if I do get some finances that is

332.23 --> 339.38
yeah more help than you can imagine and

335.12 --> 342.38
that's not that's not an exaggeration

339.38 --> 349.1
it's just practically so and it does it

342.38 --> 352.46
helped me a lot and funnily enough like

349.1 --> 357.08000000000004
as soon as I found that out I had a

352.46 --> 359.59999999999997
pretty great continuous show so it's

357.08 --> 361.58
just a natural response it's not like

359.6 --> 367.34000000000003
I'm trying to condition my public to

361.58 --> 376.15999999999997
finance me the conditioning is built

367.34 --> 382.72999999999996
within me anyway so let's see who is in

376.16 --> 384.20000000000005
chat all right we got a gem Daniel who's

382.73 --> 388.72
been doing some work with the moon

384.2 --> 391.78999999999996
apparently and some studying over McCool

388.72 --> 397.55
Ronnie foschi good to see you James

391.79 --> 402.07
Mason flat enough Davin good tome

397.55 --> 402.07
annoyed yeah I could see you all

406.58 --> 409.99899999999997
back sucks

411.199 --> 421.699
drunken bullet for one one good to see

413.52 --> 421.69899999999996
you yeah I'm not that big drunken bullet

428.509 --> 435.77000000000004
I think I was five foot seven let's see

431.71 --> 435.77
[Music]

439.05 --> 445.129
yeah roughly no wait

457.02 --> 459.68
okay

463.94 --> 468.21999999999997
yeah five-foot-seven right

468.5 --> 477.2
[Music]

473.33 --> 481.51
yeah and you eat I'm so slow today it's

477.2 --> 481.51
terrible what

482.24 --> 494.289
and it's what it is uh right oh yeah I

489.53 --> 497.38899999999995
was watching Alex Jones and yeah that

494.289 --> 500.63
there's a whole new kind of crazy going

497.389 --> 502.849
open right over there with mainstream

500.63 --> 506.06
media sources literally accusing him of

502.849 --> 510.5
something ridiculous and pretty much

506.06 --> 512.95
slandering him in the process and that's

510.5 --> 516.229
never gonna work out it's like so weird

512.95 --> 520.849
it's psychotic behavior it is almost

516.229 --> 523.13
like baller tactics but yeah in a

520.849 --> 525.9200000000001
position of actually being judicially

523.13 --> 527.45
accountable and like ballers which are

525.92 --> 530.75
just people on the internet so it's

527.45 --> 533.649
insane but they're doing this it's very

530.75 --> 533.649
weird and

538.54 --> 545.4
that was interesting I thought let's see

542.5 --> 545.4
what else happened

551.3 --> 556.78
all right yeah Jose was there I missed

554.57 --> 556.7800000000001
it

558.149 --> 564.74
I think that was pretty much it yeah

566.05 --> 572.24
hmm all right yeah the movie that I

568.52 --> 574.01
watched again recommended it was like

572.24 --> 578.24
the second recommended after the other

574.01 --> 586.55
one and it was all high-tech AI stuff

578.24 --> 594.62
again and post-apocalyptic it was like a

586.55 --> 599.3299999999999
sci-fi mystery thing and like the

594.62 --> 605.3
designs were really cool but the story

599.33 --> 607.2700000000001
yeah yeah yeah it's called a mother on

605.3 --> 610.3
Netflix

607.27 --> 613.28
apparently Nick Netflix exclusive

610.3 --> 615.1099999999999
there's like two two people in it in

613.28 --> 618.56
total so I guess it's kind of almost

615.11 --> 621.77
like the the other movie but I really

618.56 --> 623.7199999999999
thought that was a good one yeah that's

621.77 --> 626.8299999999999
funny also only two people played in

623.72 --> 630.109
that let's see what was that call again

626.83 --> 630.109
[Music]

630.93 --> 635.16
damn I got so many movies

653.05 --> 659.76
uh-huh I actually reviewed it on the

656.53 --> 659.76
show pretty early on

681.77 --> 687.21
sorry for taking so long it's really

686.46 --> 693.71
slowing me down

687.21 --> 697.5
oh right Tao that was what that was it

693.71 --> 699.57
from 2018 and also about AI but it was

697.5 --> 701.52
like a still being crow programmed and

699.57 --> 705.69
it was about this room basically

701.52 --> 708.0
completely AI controlled by programmer

705.69 --> 711.0
and it was about psychology with that it

708.0 --> 714.12
was a very interesting movie I thought

711.0 --> 717.42
this one however it was post-apocalyptic

714.12 --> 720.11
kind of a mystery a robot that was

717.42 --> 724.4399999999999
programmed to be a mother and very

720.11 --> 725.91
perfectly so like with heavy research

724.44 --> 730.6800000000001
that was pre-planned

725.91 --> 733.02
like a post-apocalyptic egg for a

730.68 --> 735.63
restart of humanity and that's like the

733.02 --> 738.48
whole the whole story the whole

735.63 --> 740.31
narrative at the first part and then

738.48 --> 743.07
everything changes I don't know if I

740.31 --> 745.0999999999999
should even spoil it but the way it

743.07 --> 745.1
changes

749.63 --> 754.3389999999999
it's like kind of a disappointment I

752.41 --> 754.819
thought they could have done more with

754.339 --> 757.759
it

754.819 --> 762.279
and there were just some actions that

757.759 --> 765.529
were just like seriously annoying drama

762.279 --> 771.11
movie tropes that were just completely

765.529 --> 773.72
stupid and pointless and that are then I

771.11 --> 777.17
can only conclude they were purely there

773.72 --> 780.5
for a general frequency indoctrinations

777.17 --> 783.56
which is just evil and so yeah I have

780.5 --> 788.199
some serious down points with this movie

783.56 --> 796.279
like it felt really dark and

788.199 --> 798.56
manipulative yeah but in general I

796.279 --> 800.12
thought the robots were done pretty cool

798.56 --> 805.25
I thought the design was very

800.12 --> 807.92
interesting it seems like there that was

805.25 --> 811.94
kind of funny the robot gave me the

807.92 --> 818.0
feeling a bit of like it would be one of

811.94 --> 821.889
those robots from what is it the robot

818.0 --> 824.329
dog company that the big robot developer

821.889 --> 829.279
company that does they like the running

824.329 --> 832.91
dog and human robots they're like for

829.279 --> 835.91
military purposes yeah what's it called

832.91 --> 839.029
again but Boston Dynamics that's right

835.91 --> 842.329
that one came to it myself

839.029 --> 846.05
but Boston Dynamics the robot had of

842.329 --> 850.8499999999999
real Boston Dynamics feel to it and that

846.05 --> 853.55
was really that made it more real and

850.85 --> 857.24
more threatening but at the same time

853.55 --> 861.62
they they overdid the threat and I was

857.24 --> 864.5600000000001
and they overdid the paranoia and it's

861.62 --> 869.079
like basically it comes down to it all

864.56 --> 875.54
the humans in this movie are stupid or

869.079 --> 878.6899999999999
extremely unwise and that's like

875.54 --> 881.0
and the robot is basically just

878.69 --> 883.25
following its programming and it is like

881.0 --> 885.62
eventually revealed its it shouldn't

883.25 --> 887.39
even be a surprise anytime AI is like in

885.62 --> 891.11
control it's always like yeah they have

887.39 --> 893.9
this super ideology oversight plan and

891.11 --> 897.35
they are just super efficient and it's

893.9 --> 901.1899999999999
inhumane in the process and is up for

897.35 --> 905.4200000000001
debate whether is that good or not yeah

901.19 --> 909.2600000000001
it's basically more material to pile on

905.42 --> 910.9399999999999
to the AI discussion and that is what

909.26 --> 913.34
this movie was about so if you're very

910.94 --> 916.75
interested in that or you want to see

913.34 --> 919.64
what what programming is happening now

916.75 --> 927.17
then that movie might be interesting so

919.64 --> 932.21
I am mother anyway right I watched that

927.17 --> 934.28
movie yeah and I'm not talking about the

932.21 --> 940.13
robot dog I'm more talking about the

934.28 --> 941.8399999999999
more human walking robot types was it

940.13 --> 944.12
Boston could have been a Japanese

941.84 --> 949.15
company as I don't know get to see all

944.12 --> 952.15
these clips and it's been a while ago

949.15 --> 952.15
anyway

952.75 --> 960.91
hmmm alright yeah video games it's just

966.46 --> 971.77
it's weird because video games are like

969.37 --> 977.86
the platforms where people are the most

971.77 --> 979.529
out-of-control it is where you can do

977.86 --> 983.44
anything without any accountability

979.529 --> 985.0889999999999
basically and that is really a state of

983.44 --> 987.24
mind generally when you become

985.089 --> 990.58
susceptible to all kinds of programming

987.24 --> 996.4300000000001
it is when you are the most free and the

990.58 --> 998.8000000000001
most unaccountable and that's also

996.43 --> 1001.3499999999999
typically why I don't like 3d shooter

998.8 --> 1002.9699999999999
games because I don't like to go there

1001.35 --> 1008.13
with my mind anymore

1002.97 --> 1011.73
used to but that that compulsion came

1008.13 --> 1014.399
forth from a need like a raw need for

1011.73 --> 1016.6800000000001
dominance and a frustration with the

1014.399 --> 1019.38
world that I would then lash out on to

1016.68 --> 1022.0699999999999
the game and I kind of learned to stop

1019.38 --> 1022.07
doing that

1024.85 --> 1030.6989999999998
and it's much healthier and I'm not

1028.059 --> 1034.799
missing it because I used to be

1030.699 --> 1034.799
miserable doing that a lot

1044.22 --> 1048.38
[Music]

1046.06 --> 1051.6799999999998
now on the other hand things like

1048.38 --> 1055.96
strategy games that's something else but

1051.68 --> 1059.0
then yeah the group behavior and

1055.96 --> 1061.49
autocracy and guilds and all that [ __ ]

1059.0 --> 1068.66
yeah that's another that's also like a

1061.49 --> 1070.46
control like it it fuels into the greed

1068.66 --> 1075.68
factor in the control and the greed

1070.46 --> 1079.8500000000001
factor and dominance that way but that

1075.68 --> 1082.55
thing is already yeah it's it's probably

1079.85 --> 1084.56
the same function like I'm pretty sure

1082.55 --> 1087.31
that yeah that we know there are some

1084.56 --> 1090.62
business people out there probably a lot

1087.31 --> 1092.78
that are really successful and then

1090.62 --> 1094.9399999999998
there's a great deal of people that have

1092.78 --> 1097.87
been successful and aren't anymore or

1094.94 --> 1102.3500000000001
that just screwed up their lives and

1097.87 --> 1106.1299999999999
they have needs to and they miss they

1102.35 --> 1112.6399999999999
miss it and so they're gonna have needs

1106.13 --> 1114.68
to to get the sensation back so I guess

1112.64 --> 1117.89
those types of games would typically

1114.68 --> 1121.55
play into those types of people and hey

1117.89 --> 1124.2700000000002
if you have at least some money then

1121.55 --> 1129.1399999999999
yeah you can quickly score the the

1124.27 --> 1134.08
number one position and unfortunately

1129.14 --> 1134.0800000000002
yeah the psychological necessity and the

1134.35 --> 1141.8899999999999
cultural inability generally to actually

1138.32 --> 1144.53
tackle it it the yeah everything has

1141.89 --> 1147.6200000000001
been designed to manipulate it not

1144.53 --> 1152.81
actually tackle it and resolve it and as

1147.62 --> 1156.2299999999998
a call as a result people then just

1152.81 --> 1159.23
throw that [ __ ] out as a necessity and

1156.23 --> 1163.43
then again there's a people right there

1159.23 --> 1168.89
trying to catch catch the money as it's

1163.43 --> 1172.27
being thrown around in in the mania as a

1168.89 --> 1172.2700000000002
mania as also a relief

1177.36 --> 1188.9699999999998
what okay that that went overboard very

1180.81 --> 1192.08
quickly their racer Effie anyway yeah

1188.97 --> 1195.3
every type of game has a type of

1192.08 --> 1196.74
psychological function things that you

1195.3 --> 1201.6
can do there that you're going to be

1196.74 --> 1204.21
confronted with and it will play into

1201.6 --> 1207.8999999999999
the needs and the abilities of people

1204.21 --> 1210.42
and as like a training ground as or as a

1207.9 --> 1212.16
venting ground when things are not doing

1210.42 --> 1215.39
great in the real world and they're

1212.16 --> 1215.39
powerless so

1236.71 --> 1244.3890000000001
right uh all right I'm gonna take a bite

1240.429 --> 1246.0300000000002
out of this Apple I need some fresh

1244.389 --> 1249.089
apple juice

1246.03 --> 1249.089
[Music]

1258.51 --> 1261.29
mmm

1273.74 --> 1277.1
what I

1282.7 --> 1288.44
[Music]

1285.56 --> 1291.4099999999999
like what are you guys talking about I

1288.44 --> 1294.65
didn't completely don't get what you're

1291.41 --> 1298.93
talking about at all are you talking to

1294.65 --> 1298.93
people that I have blocked or something

1303.53 --> 1308.55
because I got a few people blocked and

1306.03 --> 1312.36
they won't show up in the chat in the

1308.55 --> 1314.6
show at all so that that is kind of

1312.36 --> 1314.6
annoying

1321.91 --> 1324.69
what

1325.65 --> 1330.15
oh you mean the Aristarchus there you

1328.44 --> 1334.29
leave power because that's pretty much

1330.15 --> 1336.5400000000002
what you're describing there I don't

1334.29 --> 1339.6599999999999
know I there's not much to elaborate

1336.54 --> 1341.87
about it you know it's kind of specific

1339.66 --> 1344.3400000000001
it has a certain specifics

1341.87 --> 1346.83
presuppositional set up for the world if

1344.34 --> 1350.04
that turns out to be the case then it

1346.83 --> 1353.58
should be proven it should be provable

1350.04 --> 1357.51
and very specifically so so let ya get

1353.58 --> 1362.22
on with it and until that time it's just

1357.51 --> 1365.15
another model concept like so many like

1362.22 --> 1365.15
mine

1381.66 --> 1386.6100000000001
yeah racer Effie I know that technology

1384.39 --> 1392.16
it's been there since the 80s or

1386.61 --> 1393.99
something yeah a device that you can put

1392.16 --> 1395.76
on a certain bone structure that's

1393.99 --> 1401.01
directly connected with your ears and

1395.76 --> 1404.91
you hear that sound through resonating

1401.01 --> 1407.1
through your your bone directly and

1404.91 --> 1415.52
nobody else can hear that yeah

1407.1 --> 1415.52
I've experienced it personally it's old

1433.409 --> 1444.5390000000002
right well erase your Fe that's like

1437.139 --> 1446.8799999999999
literally open known technology right so

1444.539 --> 1449.44
at the same time there are some

1446.88 --> 1452.49
technology that has been out there just

1449.44 --> 1457.179
as long and nobody really talks about it

1452.49 --> 1460.86
like how to project specific sound using

1457.179 --> 1464.049
perfected refined cymatics

1460.86 --> 1467.08
to basically project a sound in a very

1464.049 --> 1470.679
specific spot and if somebody then with

1467.08 --> 1473.1589999999999
their head gets into that spot they

1470.679 --> 1475.99
start hearing that sound in their head

1473.159 --> 1479.529
okay that has been around also like

1475.99 --> 1481.029
since the 80s and like coca-cola used it

1479.529 --> 1482.98
for a while and then they took it away

1481.029 --> 1486.34
because it freaked people out so they

1482.98 --> 1488.95
say and then it's just like let's not

1486.34 --> 1494.279
talk about that anymore let's just use

1488.95 --> 1494.279
it secretly in wars and [ __ ] you know

1494.309 --> 1502.24
the voice of God like during the Desert

1498.49 --> 1503.799
Storm and everything yeah you know I

1502.24 --> 1507.48
think that's a little bit more

1503.799 --> 1510.48
interesting than just commonly used

1507.48 --> 1510.48
stuff

1523.51 --> 1528.64
it

1525.68 --> 1528.64
right

1529.52 --> 1538.21
well they've been good that what you're

1532.73 --> 1541.13
mentioning is what I just mentioned so

1538.21 --> 1546.29
that's not basically sticking a thing to

1541.13 --> 1550.3600000000001
your skull what you're referring to

1546.29 --> 1555.25
specifically exactly what I said the

1550.36 --> 1555.25
projecting of sound in specific location

1560.64 --> 1569.97
hmm right yeah I heard that that you can

1564.03 --> 1573.3899999999999
read thoughts but that's going yeah

1569.97 --> 1575.67
that's that's speculation of speculation

1573.39 --> 1579.17
territory so it's really nice and

1575.67 --> 1579.17
everything you know what

1599.36 --> 1604.069
[Music]

1619.54 --> 1626.59
yeah hold on Devin good reading

1622.6 --> 1631.78
brainwaves isn't at a distance is not

1626.59 --> 1634.8999999999999
the same thing as literally interpreting

1631.78 --> 1637.27
thoughts and sight within the mind

1634.9 --> 1641.01
projection okay that's not the same

1637.27 --> 1644.23
thing reading brain activity it's not

1641.01 --> 1649.14
quite so easy to literally like turn

1644.23 --> 1649.14
that into scrying somebody's mind okay

1675.23 --> 1680.82
yeah they been good that's really nice

1677.94 --> 1684.45
so please demonstrate this freakin

1680.82 --> 1687.27
computer in face interface that is

1684.45 --> 1690.51
literally showing what somebody sees in

1687.27 --> 1694.58
their mind okay or stop talking this

1690.51 --> 1694.58
conspiracy [ __ ] I'm getting sick of this

1694.91 --> 1701.0400000000002
look frequencies of the mind the the

1698.91 --> 1705.15
functioning of the frequencies that

1701.04 --> 1707.3999999999999
doesn't mean right that that means that

1705.15 --> 1711.63
the computer can then just read that

1707.4 --> 1716.3090000000002
activity like it's some kind of GP GG

1711.63 --> 1718.5590000000002
pack encrypted [ __ ] okay every mind

1716.309 --> 1720.9289999999999
functions and like crystallizes

1718.559 --> 1722.75
information in its own way this is

1720.929 --> 1727.02
[ __ ]

1722.75 --> 1730.53
so show me the actual output the actual

1727.02 --> 1733.29
like oh look the this is what he's

1730.53 --> 1737.07
seeing in his mind the computer showing

1733.29 --> 1739.6399999999999
it right so yeah bring it on otherwise

1737.07 --> 1743.309
the soldiers blah blah blah blah blah

1739.64 --> 1747.8300000000002
now I'm not gonna look anything up you

1743.309 --> 1747.83
bring forth the evidence or just shut up

1748.52 --> 1754.55
so a bunch of CIA echo machine babble

1772.539 --> 1784.989
so alright bring forth some evidence or

1780.149 --> 1787.9789999999998
stop talking about this [ __ ] I got a few

1784.989 --> 1787.979
minutes to think about it

1796.28 --> 1799.359
[Music]

1821.68 --> 1828.04
mmm mountainous Apple is doing some good

1831.21 --> 1833.96
hmm

1838.94 --> 1847.94
I have no Randy flutters no now this is

1844.82 --> 1853.729
the state this look if you let a guy

1847.94 --> 1856.059
talk like that alright and just he's

1853.729 --> 1858.2
been saying that [ __ ] and like with

1856.059 --> 1863.389
exclamation marks and everything for a

1858.2 --> 1867.3990000000001
while now and I asked him specific

1863.389 --> 1870.559
questions and he never even addressed it

1867.399 --> 1873.559
ok that's a telltale sign to me and that

1870.559 --> 1876.889
means that somebody's going in a in a

1873.559 --> 1878.029
rant and they don't actually know what

1876.889 --> 1880.9989999999998
they're talking about they're rather

1878.029 --> 1883.789
using the subject the PO everybody's

1880.999 --> 1887.539
interest in everybody's attention in and

1883.789 --> 1892.58
then just defense their frustration and

1887.539 --> 1895.45
I'm not gonna waste my time with that no

1892.58 --> 1895.4499999999998
matter who does that

1897.07 --> 1900.22
[Music]

1915.31 --> 1927.46
I'm not afraid of [ __ ] no look if he

1923.66 --> 1931.1000000000001
wants to spread that stuff already

1927.46 --> 1936.23
pretty much reached out delved into this

1931.1 --> 1939.35
subject brought up some facts and yeah

1936.23 --> 1941.3
if I already gave him a hand basically

1939.35 --> 1944.57
now if he's done then gonna avoid it

1941.3 --> 1949.27
like a baller yeah you're gonna get

1944.57 --> 1949.27
timed out you

1950.74 --> 1957.08
well flattered Smurf first of all I

1954.47 --> 1959.03
don't know I I don't know exactly who

1957.08 --> 1961.8999999999999
you are but times you are because you

1959.03 --> 1972.08
basically started advertising with caps

1961.9 --> 1974.0900000000001
letters and I just don't like that yeah

1972.08 --> 1976.01
you might have noticed that Jason

1974.09 --> 1978.11
McCormack is no longer in chat either

1976.01 --> 1980.66
used to always be there saying the same

1978.11 --> 1985.82
[ __ ] over and over again in caps and I

1980.66 --> 1988.46
got sick of it no it's okay I might have

1985.82 --> 2006.24
been a little bit rushed in my judgment

1988.46 --> 2006.24
there right

2021.95 --> 2029.25
yeah yeah right bill G yeah

2027.06 --> 2030.96
Marwan is proving crafty with that Apple

2029.25 --> 2036.75
like nursin did and well he didn't do it

2030.96 --> 2039.99
like that but look anything anything

2036.75 --> 2042.35
almost anything can prove gravity if you

2039.99 --> 2045.3
just presuppose it

2042.35 --> 2050.94
that's what's so stubborn about it

2045.3 --> 2054.45
that's what so that's why it's so hard

2050.94 --> 2058.55
to get rid of back because anything can

2054.45 --> 2058.5499999999997
prove gravity if you just presuppose it

2080.03 --> 2090.86
oh you can post links well if you're

2089.06 --> 2094.669
gonna be all caps II about it that's not

2090.86 --> 2102.29
gonna happen that's not gonna help after

2094.669 --> 2105.46
all but alright so that's really nice

2102.29 --> 2113.9
yeah there's a way to basically read

2105.46 --> 2117.4700000000003
people so where is it all right because

2113.9 --> 2121.34
I wouldn't be surprised that if they

2117.47 --> 2123.98
really like put a a helmet with all the

2121.34 --> 2126.71
the read stuff and whatever in a

2123.98 --> 2128.84
specially prepared patient and they

2126.71 --> 2131.12
would start to basically interface with

2128.84 --> 2134.02
those readings and then try to achieve

2131.12 --> 2137.48
it I think that over time they could

2134.02 --> 2140.9
potentially like maybe get images out of

2137.48 --> 2146.12
it right that's something entirely

2140.9 --> 2148.73
different as just arriving taking a

2146.12 --> 2152.2999999999997
device taking a reading over a distance

2148.73 --> 2156.32
and then just seeing every that doesn't

2152.3 --> 2162.5600000000004
make any damn sense and that's why I say

2156.32 --> 2166.9300000000003
please the actual evidence I don't need

2162.56 --> 2166.93
more presuppositional structures

2169.46 --> 2182.829
I want yeah I want the actual detail the

2173.18 --> 2185.2999999999997
confirmations of the claims mm-hmm

2182.829 --> 2192.71
also Devon good yeah sorry about the

2185.3 --> 2195.65
link thing you can bypass it though by

2192.71 --> 2198.17
just typing the full link I'm taking the

2195.65 --> 2204.92
front part away of it dwe up until the

2198.17 --> 2210.079
point and at the dot-com or whatever put

2204.92 --> 2217.76
a space like in in between them on both

2210.079 --> 2224.44
sides of that duck and it'll work mmm

2217.76 --> 2224.44
that one okay I'll take a look

2236.51 --> 2248.2200000000003
wearable neuro interface oh god yeah

2242.069 --> 2256.38
right again that's that's something that

2248.22 --> 2259.8289999999997
has to be attuned so now let me continue

2256.38 --> 2262.4100000000003
on speculating on top of this right this

2259.829 --> 2266.579
system which is basically a system you

2262.41 --> 2269.73
have to put on top of you then probably

2266.579 --> 2273.0600000000004
adapt it to learn to interface with it

2269.73 --> 2277.53
and then it will keep on working right

2273.06 --> 2280.589
so technically if that device would have

2277.53 --> 2283.17
would be attune to somebody then it

2280.589 --> 2286.04
wouldn't be too far fetched that if

2283.17 --> 2290.01
somebody would get a grip on that device

2286.04 --> 2292.369
actually get the parameters it is set to

2290.01 --> 2296.7900000000004
to interface with that specific person

2292.369 --> 2301.349
takes it out D D D parameters and then

2296.79 --> 2304.25
uses those to use the distance reading

2301.349 --> 2307.619
device on the same frequency to try to

2304.25 --> 2312.74
interface now there is something that

2307.619 --> 2315.2400000000002
makes technical sense right that's still

2312.74 --> 2319.6699999999996
it's still something that has to be

2315.24 --> 2322.109
attuned so how do you freaking attune to

2319.67 --> 2323.9700000000003
figuring out a connection with somebody

2322.109 --> 2326.52
that doesn't even know they're

2323.97 --> 2329.25
connecting that nuts doesn't necessarily

2326.52 --> 2334.849
want to connect on a distance sorry it

2329.25 --> 2334.849
just I need something more concrete

2342.41 --> 2349.35
yeah that's nice they've been good so

2345.78 --> 2353.1800000000003
can you please hand me some actual data

2349.35 --> 2356.85
and not these claims not these supposed

2353.18 --> 2360.96
patents that say things how about some

2356.85 --> 2365.3399999999997
actual proof that it works and what it

2360.96 --> 2367.9700000000003
actually does specifically what the data

2365.34 --> 2371.28
is that comes out of it specifically

2367.97 --> 2373.41
because yeah you just seem to claim all

2371.28 --> 2376.88
over the place it's getting it's getting

2373.41 --> 2376.8799999999997
bit tedious again

2419.5 --> 2423.369
somebody's not been paying attention

2426.14 --> 2429.219
[Music]

2431.98 --> 2438.909
[Music]

2506.51 --> 2510.71
excuse me Jose don't get cocky on me

2509.19 --> 2516.51
please

2510.71 --> 2519.7200000000003
but look he's not a faceless troll he

2516.51 --> 2522.75
comes on panels he talks but he goes too

2519.72 --> 2526.589
far and he seems to be a little bit

2522.75 --> 2531.24
obsessive about things like the typical

2526.589 --> 2534.569
hype and yeah still waiting for the

2531.24 --> 2537.02
actual putting together of the pieces to

2534.569 --> 2537.02
make it all work

2544.27 --> 2547.27
that's

[Music]

2570.49 --> 2576.4199999999996
well I was a somebody's having big long

2574.33 --> 2580.7799999999997
toes today

2576.42 --> 2582.839
why would I block you I'm just telling

2580.78 --> 2588.82
you don't get cocky

2582.839 --> 2592.32
telling ya he's not a faceless troll he

2588.82 --> 2596.53
just yeah he is the way he is I

2592.32 --> 2601.9
explained it I presented the problem

2596.53 --> 2605.8590000000004
with him obsessive nature and apparently

2601.9 --> 2607.7200000000003
not the tendency or the he learned

2605.859 --> 2610.619
behavior to put the puzzle pieces

2607.72 --> 2616.18
together and actually trace down some

2610.619 --> 2618.4300000000003
tangible data to actually confirm the

2616.18 --> 2621.58
structure of the theory instead of just

2618.43 --> 2626.2599999999998
focusing on the conspiracy theory

2621.58 --> 2628.5989999999997
structure alright okay I'm gonna need

2626.26 --> 2634.78
some assistance from the moderator so

2628.599 --> 2638.6400000000003
please guys pay attention there are some

2634.78 --> 2638.6400000000003
messed up trolls and chat

2650.079 --> 2658.01
mmm whitey yeah I am subscribed to

2655.069 --> 2661.67
[ __ ] seven I don't always follow

2658.01 --> 2664.73
everything about him I do follow him

2661.67 --> 2670.54
occasionally yeah he's a he's a good

2664.73 --> 2673.52
speaker and I don't know he's been

2670.54 --> 2677.66
developing in all kinds of direction so

2673.52 --> 2679.52
whatever I seen I am NOT I won't be able

2677.66 --> 2682.2799999999997
to basically get a complete picture of

2679.52 --> 2684.849
how he's been developing at this point

2682.28 --> 2691.0600000000004
because I'm not familiar enough with him

2684.849 --> 2692.3590000000004
but I do recognize that he that he has

2691.06 --> 2694.79
yeah

2692.359 --> 2700.91
they dealt with a lot of information and

2694.79 --> 2704.089
data and yeah that's just interesting by

2700.91 --> 2707.5099999999998
its own volition and as far as his

2704.089 --> 2710.81
interpretations and his the conclusions

2707.51 --> 2713.5400000000004
he would typically jump to I don't know

2710.81 --> 2719.15
from the past what I remember I tended

2713.54 --> 2721.04
to thought it was a little bit over

2719.15 --> 2724.48
hasty sometimes bother I don't know

2721.04 --> 2724.48
maybe that's changed a lot

2730.77 --> 2733.369
all right

2738.04 --> 2745.3
but isn't he like on truth frequency

2741.55 --> 2749.04
radio exclusively does he even do live

2745.3 --> 2749.04
YouTube anymore

2762.02 --> 2766.18
no Jose I didn't see it sorry

2801.16 --> 2815.89
ah yeah sorry for the long pause again

2808.599 --> 2818.13
the heat maybe you should just put the

2815.89 --> 2818.1299999999997
door

2826.92 --> 2831.9300000000003
because yeah the the doors are open

2830.16 --> 2836.7
everywhere and there's a window open so

2831.93 --> 2839.99
hopefully there can gum some air stream

2836.7 --> 2839.99
to cool it all down

2868.64 --> 2870.67
ah

2874.7 --> 2879.02
it's weird it's like

2881.7 --> 2893.35
three more months until the Amsterdam

2888.97 --> 2896.83
Flat Earth conference

2893.35 --> 2899.0499999999997
looking really forward to that I hope to

2896.83 --> 2901.9
be fair it's not gonna be as warm as it

2899.05 --> 2905.5
is now because that's just too much if

2901.9 --> 2907.8
it's just decent and dry that would be

2905.5 --> 2907.8
great

2924.2 --> 2943.759
right so that helped okay I'm probably

2938.22 --> 2943.759
gonna round out the show early I what

2959.219 --> 2962.219
nice

2966.78 --> 2972.57
yeah peanuts clerk yeah I'm okay I'm

2970.62 --> 2975.48
just a little flustered by the heat I

2972.57 --> 2980.4
have a few back problems relating to the

2975.48 --> 2983.07
last stages of basically my my cold my

2980.4 --> 2985.89
metabolic transformation process which

2983.07 --> 2989.31
is gradual basically from up to down and

2985.89 --> 2991.89
it's now at yeah top the tip of my lungs

2989.31 --> 2995.13
and my back so that's kind of annoying

2991.89 --> 2998.25
it slows me down a lot it distracts me a

2995.13 --> 3001.31
lot the combination of the heat is with

2998.25 --> 3009.49
it especially so I'm not as fluent as

3001.31 --> 3009.49
normally and yeah but I will be alright

3010.51 --> 3019.3700000000003
so freaking on yeah oh yeah by the way

3015.53 --> 3022.63
guys for any new subscribers who haven't

3019.37 --> 3027.04
tuned out yet sorry about all this but

3022.63 --> 3030.26
yeah the earth is flat just so you know

3027.04 --> 3034.25
that's weird because we all been taught

3030.26 --> 3036.17
in school for a television that yeah as

3034.25 --> 3041.0
always this ball the earth it's always

3036.17 --> 3043.9700000000003
like oh and again listening to Alex

3041.0 --> 3051.05
Jones right he does it every single

3043.97 --> 3053.8399999999997
chance he gets he is a baller as in alex

3051.05 --> 3056.54
jones i think is a baller on the level

3053.84 --> 3059.9900000000002
of the baller ballers the annoying

3056.54 --> 3065.05
ballers cuz he's such a perfect is such

3059.99 --> 3067.93
a fanatical perfectionist like he on

3065.05 --> 3072.59
purpose doesn't branch out to other

3067.93 --> 3075.89
terminologies to make it more fluent no

3072.59 --> 3081.23
he specifically chooses the baller

3075.89 --> 3083.54
saying path when he says things every

3081.23 --> 3086.18
single time every chance he gets he is

3083.54 --> 3089.21
such a fanatic the only difference with

3086.18 --> 3090.71
him and the the baller ballers we deal

3089.21 --> 3094.7
with in the debates and everything is

3090.71 --> 3098.84
that he actually has a big plan and he's

3094.7 --> 3100.72
much more strategical at it much more

3098.84 --> 3106.88
reserved

3100.72 --> 3108.98
and yeah that will definitely get on the

3106.88 --> 3111.5
nerves of a lot of flat-earthers I bet

3108.98 --> 3115.04
it will it kind of gets on my nerves as

3111.5 --> 3116.99
well but he's just yeah he's unrepentant

3115.04 --> 3118.88
and he's gonna keep on doing that and

3116.99 --> 3123.5299999999997
there's probably nothing that we can do

3118.88 --> 3125.6600000000003
about it except yeah in shock moments

3123.53 --> 3127.9100000000003
basically slap it in his face and then

3125.66 --> 3133.5499999999997
he's gonna be all like what the hell is

3127.91 --> 3136.04
this how why why did you do that this is

3133.55 --> 3138.77
nonsense and yeah you like gonna treat

3136.04 --> 3141.02
it like it's a religion on the spot but

3138.77 --> 3146.06
he hates it I'm pretty sure he does

3141.02 --> 3151.61
or maybe he doesn't but he insists

3146.06 --> 3153.68
himself on using the the baller sayings

3151.61 --> 3155.69
that language that reinforcement

3153.68 --> 3158.6
language of the baller religion he

3155.69 --> 3163.51
insists on using it every single time

3158.6 --> 3166.37
and he's very persistent about it and

3163.51 --> 3169.76
that yeah that does really get me

3166.37 --> 3172.31
because yeah everybody takes their own

3169.76 --> 3176.65
development and for example oh and

3172.31 --> 3178.73
Shroyer is his wingman with the war room

3176.65 --> 3181.64
he didn't do that

3178.73 --> 3187.64
and he even mentions Flat Earth at times

3181.64 --> 3190.7
and he's being like a good baller as it

3187.64 --> 3193.7
were maybe maybe it's like a team good

3190.7 --> 3196.2799999999997
ball or bad baller I don't know but he's

3193.7 --> 3198.7599999999998
like yeah definitely free speech it's

3196.28 --> 3202.25
interesting there's new ways of thinking

3198.76 --> 3204.59
there's just different ideas that globe

3202.25 --> 3209.18
thinkers that never think about there's

3204.59 --> 3211.01
problems that we grab that are

3209.18 --> 3213.83
interesting so he's much more

3211.01 --> 3217.01
open-minded and he's daily part of the

3213.83 --> 3220.19
Alex Jones Show as well so you can't

3217.01 --> 3223.78
just say oh alex is such a baller and

3220.19 --> 3223.78
that ruins it all no

3227.069 --> 3240.119
things are just a little bit more

3229.24 --> 3240.1189999999997
complex than that Oh what

3241.69 --> 3251.68
all right yeah Frank black get out

3247.02 --> 3255.809
so yeah Alex Jones didn't get caught he

3251.68 --> 3259.6299999999997
got screwed over he literally got set up

3255.809 --> 3262.63
it's ridiculous it's a very embarrassing

3259.63 --> 3264.19
shitty thing and now I know because

3262.63 --> 3266.289
there are so many people that

3264.19 --> 3269.2200000000003
politically and irrationally hate him

3266.289 --> 3271.9300000000003
because of the less left-wing media

3269.22 --> 3276.1899999999996
insanity [ __ ] that has been poured out

3271.93 --> 3278.6499999999996
on the world that don't kind of do

3276.19 --> 3282.339
everything they can to spread that meme

3278.65 --> 3285.96
that he did that just a [ __ ] all over

3282.339 --> 3289.599
him like a massive troll operation

3285.96 --> 3297.16
naturally unfolding and that sucks and I

3289.599 --> 3299.94
refuse to to allow that on my show in

3297.16 --> 3299.94
any way

3305.63 --> 3313.01
right peanuts clerk thank you thank you

3308.96 --> 3316.04
that's exactly what I mean look Alex

3313.01 --> 3319.19
Jones himself even him out of his mouth

3316.04 --> 3322.91
he doesn't say it often like or since

3319.19 --> 3324.7400000000002
the least amount he can but he did I did

3322.91 --> 3327.14
catch him one time it's been a while

3324.74 --> 3329.2599999999998
saying like yeah if they're gonna come

3327.14 --> 3331.73
after flat-earthers

3329.26 --> 3333.98
that yeah everybody might think that's

3331.73 --> 3336.2
okay because they're crazy but the free

3333.98 --> 3338.9900000000002
speech and he does that with every group

3336.2 --> 3340.58
does that with like you yeah even the

3338.99 --> 3342.83
Nazis even though there are total

3340.58 --> 3345.65
lunatics as long as they don't call for

3342.83 --> 3348.91
violence they should be loud and yeah

3345.65 --> 3351.23
that's I agree with that principle and

3348.91 --> 3354.17
that is something I do appreciate about

3351.23 --> 3361.51
him even though he freakin hates fly her

3354.17 --> 3366.29
so much and yeah we are in the middle of

3361.51 --> 3368.75
a free speech world war right now I

3366.29 --> 3371.36
think that is a way we can put it the

3368.75 --> 3375.26
free speech issue is now a worldwide

3371.36 --> 3377.84
issue there this is the free speech Wars

3375.26 --> 3383.38
of the Internet that's what's happening

3377.84 --> 3386.03
and there's yeah a clear empire

3383.38 --> 3392.6600000000003
censorship crackdown and go going on

3386.03 --> 3394.5800000000004
from one particular swath of people

3392.66 --> 3396.98
groups and interests that are going

3394.58 --> 3400.04
along with that and then there is just

3396.98 --> 3406.84
the rest that are tagging along or that

3400.04 --> 3406.84
are like trying to undo the the trance

3407.08 --> 3413.74
and do the trance to basically yeah get

3411.05 --> 3413.7400000000002
more decentralized

3421.03 --> 3426.9500000000003
