2.81 --> 10.68
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.839 --> 14.55
early-bird number 33 I'm your host

10.68 --> 20.7
Arwen and today is going to be a little

14.55 --> 24.119
bit extra long show and any guests yet

20.7 --> 27.049999999999997
although the link is out but I wanna

24.119 --> 28.619
talk a bit today about an intro that I'm

27.05 --> 34.980000000000004
working on

28.619 --> 39.929
well to be fair it was basically Chris

34.98 --> 43.169999999999995
Chris Perry that offered me to make an

39.929 --> 44.300000000000004
intro song and I thought like oh yeah

43.17 --> 48.389
sure okay

44.3 --> 53.489
fine and he showed me some samples but

48.389 --> 58.109
yeah this guy he's a real pro because I

53.489 --> 61.169999999999995
am very critical when it comes to or

58.109 --> 63.120000000000005
picky when it comes to music and I

61.17 --> 65.339
wasn't completely satisfied and I

63.12 --> 72.63
thought like oh yeah sure but he

65.339 --> 76.14
actually worked on it and yeah I gave

72.63 --> 79.369
him the link to one of the literally the

76.14 --> 83.039
first video I uploaded on this channel

79.369 --> 85.469
was the second of my mother's music and

83.039 --> 91.469
he listened to it and he made a really

85.469 --> 96.21
good good song for it and I'm not sure

91.469 --> 97.89
if I can play it here if it if the sound

96.21 --> 102.75
would come through because it's through

97.89 --> 105.95
a website but yeah I got a good song and

102.75 --> 109.89
I got a good idea and all I need now is

105.95 --> 113.7
basically somebody to make an an

109.89 --> 115.259
animated intro title card thingy like

113.7 --> 121.799
the title and I already have something

115.259 --> 124.859
in mind not to 3d not too flashy in the

121.799 --> 127.74000000000001
tone of the show so yeah if anybody out

PowerPoint thingy but like a pretty

141.54 --> 149.51999999999998
decent looking title card like an

145.38 --> 152.07
animation which would be maybe 2 to 4

149.52 --> 154.32000000000002
seconds or something yeah if you know

152.07 --> 156.87
anyone or if you're seeing this show and

skype and be part of the title card and

164.87 --> 176.55
yeah I'll put your name in in it as well

169.52 --> 178.65
so yeah and I'm really enthusiastic

176.55 --> 182.43
about I never had a title card before

178.65 --> 185.94
I've always been very like yeah I just

182.43 --> 190.68
gonna do what I do and consistency but

185.94 --> 193.65
yeah a really fitting title card can

190.68 --> 196.44
contribute and especially if it's gonna

193.65 --> 200.52
be a daily show it'll have a nice tone

196.44 --> 200.88
to it so yeah it's gonna be like half a

200.52 --> 206.61
minute

200.88 --> 210.959
total I think maybe a little longer so I

206.61 --> 212.82000000000002
wanted to share that see Daniel Philip

210.959 --> 213.6
listen chat earlier and Nicolas is

212.82 --> 221.19
already here

213.6 --> 223.35
yep it's a little extra early and

221.19 --> 226.23
thought before like yeah I'm gonna start

223.35 --> 229.17
a half hour earlier but that's maybe a

226.23 --> 232.82999999999998
little bit too much so just 50 minutes

229.17 --> 234.80999999999997
extra and I don't know if it's gets all

232.83 --> 237.63000000000002
rusted and everything although I doubt

234.81 --> 240.56
it because so far that does never seem

237.63 --> 243.12
to happen or hasn't happened last week

240.56 --> 249.68
then yeah I can always just MIT turned

243.12 --> 255.9
it into an hour anyway and all the pens

249.68 --> 261.81
people are gonna join me hmm so weather

255.9 --> 266.039
reports it's mixed whether it's not too

261.81 --> 267.44
cloudy not too clear only raining at the

266.039 --> 270.14
location

267.44 --> 274.73
not windy which is very nice but it is

270.14 --> 276.91999999999996
fresh and yet little bit of rain every

274.73 --> 280.82
now and then but yeah

276.92 --> 283.93
not the majority of the time so typical

280.82 --> 283.93
Dutch winters day

296.36 --> 309.97900000000004
oh dear silly questions roll again

301.9 --> 313.12899999999996
alright look you're probably a troll but

309.979 --> 315.43
I'm gonna answer it anyway cuz yeah I

313.129 --> 319.25
can't help but answer questions you

315.43 --> 321.349
leave real wizards exist well it all

319.25 --> 326.449
depends on what you're going to define

321.349 --> 329.96
as a wizard because technically it's

326.449 --> 332.33000000000004
just a person with a lotta insight that

329.96 --> 334.44899999999996
knows things and knows how to figure out

332.33 --> 337.31
things where others just don't see it

334.449 --> 339.349
that's really what makes a wizard so in

337.31 --> 344.169
that sense yeah I do believe in wizards

339.349 --> 347.24
and in a more generalized fashion you

344.169 --> 351.68
good indeed call me one I really have no

347.24 --> 355.009
objection to that at all and as for

351.68 --> 356.87
magical abilities yeah that all depends

355.009 --> 360.74
on what you're going to see as magical

356.87 --> 365.779
abilities because I see my abilities as

360.74 --> 372.19
natural as something that even animals

365.779 --> 377.74
can do animals have psionic abilities so

372.19 --> 381.05
is that magic our animals magical no

377.74 --> 384.379
it's just another ability and so is

381.05 --> 387.169
healing and I can even point and the

384.379 --> 391.879
roots of these abilities some abilities

387.169 --> 393.79999999999995
are purely spiritual it's inherited with

391.879 --> 396.589
the spirit and what it does with the

393.8 --> 399.469
senses especially the psionics reading

396.589 --> 403.69
people empathizing all that it's very

399.469 --> 408.409
much spiritual but healing is a very

403.69 --> 410.71
social grounded physical ability that's

408.409 --> 413.69
really interesting how that works and

410.71 --> 419.81
then there's of course the the Reiki

413.69 --> 423.08
approach which is like a combination

419.81 --> 428.36
it's spirit yeah you use the spiritual

423.08 --> 429.77
to basically load something physical

428.36 --> 433.37
with energy with

429.77 --> 434.62899999999996
excessive energy so yeah magic who is it

433.37 --> 436.25
Oh magical

434.629 --> 441.28900000000004
well yeah it all depends on how you're

436.25 --> 444.699
gonna see it I I feel like it's magical

441.289 --> 447.46
from an older perspective like yeah

444.699 --> 451.129
especially when I learned to magnetize

447.46 --> 454.06899999999996
when I was 18 oh my god yeah that was

451.129 --> 458.449
magic absolutely to me is like oh my god

454.069 --> 460.31
I have powers seriously that's why I

458.449 --> 461.84000000000003
found out that's how I felt like oh my

460.31 --> 466.37
god what else can I do

461.84 --> 469.00899999999996
and yeah I can do more stuff but I've

466.37 --> 472.27
also learned over time just what it is

469.009 --> 475.849
where it comes from how it works and how

472.27 --> 479.919
people overlook this these abilities

475.849 --> 483.19
they don't invest it like investing in

479.919 --> 487.849
skills how to cope with things or how to

483.19 --> 491.389
perform you can invest skills in these

487.849 --> 493.88
things if you actually have a vision if

491.389 --> 496.069
you have a view on where you're going on

493.88 --> 498.62
how it works you can actually build it

496.069 --> 501.65000000000003
you have to understand these skills to

498.62 --> 503.99
be able to build it yeah it's not just

501.65 --> 505.669
not just muscle training you have to

503.99 --> 509.599
know what you do it but yeah you could

505.669 --> 511.729
prepare it even to to working out you

509.599 --> 513.709
know you can just rough the workout

511.729 --> 515.06
muscles like yeah yeah muscle building

513.709 --> 517.8489999999999
but yeah if you don't know what you're

515.06 --> 519.89
doing you're gonna be like oh [ __ ] I

517.849 --> 521.599
forgot this that that trainer gonna tell

519.89 --> 523.31
you no you have to do it in this rhythm

521.599 --> 526.82
you have to take this kind of

523.31 --> 530.27
supplements and you got to do stretching

526.82 --> 532.399
all these thing because they know how it

530.27 --> 534.74
works or if you're gonna train your

532.399 --> 536.99
psionic abilities or healing abilities

534.74 --> 538.64
yeah you have to actually know what's

536.99 --> 541.01
going on you have to figure it out or

538.64 --> 544.48
you have to learn that from other people

541.01 --> 549.35
that know how to use it and just learn

544.48 --> 552.47
yeah this is how it works this is what

549.35 --> 558.62
you must prevent and this is the

552.47 --> 561.1600000000001
long-term consequences so yeah and if

558.62 --> 563.65
you have oversight then you can actually

561.16 --> 566.24
train it in a way that

563.65 --> 574.16
that will make you better and that won't

566.24 --> 577.49
burn you out so wizard yeah I believe in

574.16 --> 584.24
Wizards this wizard is basically a human

577.49 --> 587.33
that just knows more and that especially

584.24 --> 589.85
what makes a wizard is the knowledge of

587.33 --> 592.4300000000001
the obscure things that other people

589.85 --> 595.7900000000001
tend to not delve in because either it's

592.43 --> 599.2099999999999
too complex or too scary and a wizard

595.79 --> 601.63
will want to figure this out especially

599.21 --> 604.97
because nobody else wants

601.63 --> 607.13
once that makes it even more like oh

604.97 --> 612.98
maybe I can find something unique there

607.13 --> 616.85
that is really what happens so yeah

612.98 --> 623.62
wizard I don't know is it really that

616.85 --> 626.45
weird you know and well we learn about

623.62 --> 629.96
wizardry and witchcraft and all the

626.45 --> 632.0300000000001
magical approaches from TV and they show

629.96 --> 635.5400000000001
us their whole works and it's all very

632.03 --> 637.91
computer games so turns into computer

635.54 --> 642.8
games you know like ooh we're gonna

637.91 --> 644.98
blast an energy thingy or a beam or you

642.8 --> 649.88
say a couple of words and this happens

644.98 --> 653.66
well it's all very nice but yeah that's

649.88 --> 656.78
a like a game construct with rules it's

653.66 --> 660.37
very much like D&D also works like this

656.78 --> 663.62
it's just it's a construction of

660.37 --> 665.63
ethereal elements into a structure and

663.62 --> 667.87
with rules and everything and you can

665.63 --> 672.14
puzzle with that like a computer game

667.87 --> 675.38
that's what fantasy movies and series

672.14 --> 679.01
tend to do these rules and oh yeah to

675.38 --> 683.81
get this for that and the next level

679.01 --> 687.34
yeah that's that's why that is in real

683.81 --> 691.6999999999999
life however it is just a natural skill

687.34 --> 693.86
it's just something people can do that

691.7 --> 696.6400000000001
in a general sense is not really

693.86 --> 696.64
expected

698.08 --> 709.4000000000001
people can just do stuff and it's also

706.85 --> 713.03
part of the cultural dumbing down it's

709.4 --> 716.09
just so part of this this fake world

713.03 --> 717.53
image like yeah this is everything we're

716.09 --> 720.02
supposed to be this is where we're

717.53 --> 726.8
coming from this is where we're going

720.02 --> 729.97
and humans are just yeah artificial yeah

726.8 --> 734.15
it's a fake conscious side effect of the

729.97 --> 736.1600000000001
biological robot and everything yeah we

734.15 --> 737.9599999999999
have fantasy and makes us believe

736.16 --> 740.27
anything so-called

737.96 --> 742.01
and nothing or almost nothing is

740.27 --> 744.56
actually reals always a better

742.01 --> 746.78
explanation or it's just an anomaly or

744.56 --> 749.8699999999999
bla bla bla let's not talk about it but

746.78 --> 755.51
yeah psionic abilities are a part of

749.87 --> 759.53
nature a part of life and it has been

755.51 --> 761.78
unthought to our culture in many ways

759.53 --> 766.4599999999999
discouraged declared witchcraft

761.78 --> 770.6
persecuted ridicules denied so many ways

766.46 --> 772.2800000000001
like you do anything that's out of the

770.6 --> 777.5600000000001
ordinary than either you're suspicious

772.28 --> 779.15
or you are evil or yeah you from a

777.56 --> 781.78
Christian angle it is the devil

779.15 --> 786.41
persecution as soon as you do anything

781.78 --> 790.66
natural or whatever then they're gonna

786.41 --> 794.7199999999999
be suspecting a nefarious motivation or

790.66 --> 796.79
yeah some devil somewhere being involved

794.72 --> 799.76
because otherwise yeah that's how that's

796.79 --> 803.93
thought about I think that's really key

799.76 --> 804.56
I think a lot of people think that's

803.93 --> 812.3
ridiculous

804.56 --> 814.4599999999999
but yeah so problematic in the in the

812.3 --> 818.99
more persecuting surface of Christianity

814.46 --> 821.45
magic is persecuted and in the hardcore

818.99 --> 826.1800000000001
scientism division it is just completely

821.45 --> 826.1800000000001
denied and ridiculed and declared insane

827.49 --> 834.689
or just not really touched upon and in

830.61 --> 846.3290000000001
that sense yeah no no I I think it's

834.689 --> 850.439
just natural and Oh like with all paths

846.329 --> 853.709
people take yeah whatever skills you're

850.439 --> 856.86
gonna acquire it really matters what

853.709 --> 861.42
purpose guides you to use these skills

856.86 --> 864.779
and how do you apply them and what are

861.42 --> 870.66
your end goals are there are they based

864.779 --> 874.829
on the power or creed or just control

870.66 --> 878.459
more for you domination or are they

874.829 --> 882.8389999999999
gonna be used to improve the world and

878.459 --> 888.7199999999999
to spread the positive abilities of

882.839 --> 891.4490000000001
people so everything becomes better you

888.72 --> 894.749
know that is what matters most with any

891.449 --> 899.6099999999999
skill be it just practical skill social

894.749 --> 903.089
skills technical skills or yeah magical

899.61 --> 904.559
skills all depends like what are you

903.089 --> 908.5490000000001
gonna do if somebody is going to be

904.559 --> 914.009
psionic then you better damn well hope

908.549 --> 915.899
that they are nice people because well

914.009 --> 917.759
you will feel them anyway otherwise you

915.899 --> 920.339
get like this all wrong effect you'll

917.759 --> 923.97
start like somebody's evil and like

920.339 --> 927.629
really psionically talented well they

923.97 --> 931.0790000000001
risk a lot just by being like that a lot

927.629 --> 933.149
because book spirits that you become

931.079 --> 935.0089999999999
subject to or that you become

933.149 --> 938.339
susceptible to when you delve into

935.009 --> 940.23
darkness can actually use your psionic

938.339 --> 942.509
ability so if you have them and you have

940.23 --> 946.619
them strongly and you go you dwell in

942.509 --> 950.91
darkness you risk a lot especially to

946.619 --> 953.999
those close to you so I wouldn't

950.91 --> 957.4699999999999
recommend it and yeah if somebody does

953.999 --> 961.19
do that then the people around them will

957.47 --> 963.0500000000001
feel it even more than somebody right

961.19 --> 972.139
that's just like a criminal hiding

963.05 --> 974.62
something it's different yes yeah you

972.139 --> 978.649
just feel it I feel it

974.62 --> 980.66
accent felt like even in the gothic

978.649 --> 985.329
scene there's all kinds of people there

980.66 --> 989.12
and there are some really evil people

985.329 --> 993.9799999999999
sometimes dwelling in but like hiding in

989.12 --> 996.5600000000001
there it's like it's like a trick yeah

993.98 --> 998.87
because it's the carnival effect because

996.56 --> 1001.2689999999999
everybody is acting or looking crazy

998.87 --> 1003.189
people that are actually crazy don't

1001.269 --> 1006.129
stand out so much so they feel more

1003.189 --> 1008.709
comfortable in there it's it's weird

1006.129 --> 1013.269
yeah I've felt the presence of some

1008.709 --> 1015.25
really evil people and they would be

1013.269 --> 1020.199
peaceful and I would even talk to them

1015.25 --> 1023.64
but they just didn't have certain senses

1020.199 --> 1027.52
and they just were so negative they lost

1023.64 --> 1031.809
philosophically that this was hopeless

1027.52 --> 1034.78
just I tried to like yeah I can't help

1031.809 --> 1036.819
but I'm such it's annoying paladin like

1034.78 --> 1040.03
good guy so I will walk up to anyone

1036.819 --> 1042.6689999999999
that's trapped in negative spiral for

1040.03 --> 1047.11
whatever reason be it religious or

1042.669 --> 1051.76
philosophical or just just circumstances

1047.11 --> 1054.549
and try to give them some hope or some

1051.76 --> 1056.799
angle some other angle like and try to

1054.549 --> 1062.2
encourage them like this can really help

1056.799 --> 1065.1689999999999
you get out of this spiral I'll do it to

1062.2 --> 1069.73
anyone even people that I probably

1065.169 --> 1072.8090000000002
shouldn't approach and I did and I'm not

1069.73 --> 1078.94
risking so much again I was really not

1072.809 --> 1082.9289999999999
so personal religious conviction that

1078.94 --> 1085.48
anyone can just be switched like it like

1082.929 --> 1087.49
like a darth vader back to Anakin

1085.48 --> 1090.49
Skywalker that kind of effect I was

1087.49 --> 1094.809
almost obsessed like I thought I can do

1090.49 --> 1096.3990000000001
that with anyone well I can't and do it

1094.809 --> 1100.809
figured out in the meantime you can only

1096.399 --> 1105.61
really do it with people that want it

1100.809 --> 1108.07
and yeah you can plant seeds you can

1105.61 --> 1110.74
push it and you gotta be really careful

1108.07 --> 1116.049
with people that have sunk really really

1110.74 --> 1120.96
deep because yeah the people that are

1116.049 --> 1124.09
this asleep the worst they will actually

1120.96 --> 1127.3600000000001
fight you they will hate you for trying

1124.09 --> 1131.039
to awaken them and that can be in some

1127.36 --> 1136.4499999999998
kind of illusion or it can be in the

1131.039 --> 1140.049
this the hundred eighty degree moral if

1136.45 --> 1143.32
you're the reversed world viewers but

1140.049 --> 1150.94
the same people that philosophically do

1143.32 --> 1153.9399999999998
that you gotta be yeah everybody that is

1150.94 --> 1157.509
really some people will take offense to

1153.94 --> 1159.3300000000002
you trying to genuinely help them that's

1157.509 --> 1162.759
the weird thing they would rather have

1159.33 --> 1166.96
that you would approach them with some

1162.759 --> 1169.45
kind of ego driven purpose like yeah you

1166.96 --> 1173.23
want something from them they would

1169.45 --> 1177.8500000000001
rather have you try to scam them and rip

1173.23 --> 1182.309
you off then actually genuinely want to

1177.85 --> 1185.4989999999998
help them as a person literally that's

1182.309 --> 1191.73
really how that works I've experienced

1185.499 --> 1191.73
it it is freaky yeah

1193.07 --> 1204.86
so let's see ah the check rainfall I see

1197.94 --> 1206.49
let's use here yeah at a Meakin nice -

1204.86 --> 1215.4499999999998
thanks for coming

1206.49 --> 1215.45
know you're listening Daniel fields back

1216.68 --> 1225.03
Eric machine see you Dan Winfield

1222.08 --> 1230.49
morning dude chin Walter good to see you

1225.03 --> 1235.3999999999999
a fee Viking conspiracy cats that the

1230.49 --> 1235.4
real here see

1241.45 --> 1248.419
whoa yeah it's the real conspiracy cats

1244.25 --> 1250.37
okay I do it yeah we're not really

1248.419 --> 1256.13
talking about flat earth at the moment

1250.37 --> 1259.9399999999998
too much I took like 50 minutes to

1256.13 --> 1262.63
answer a basic troll question yeah

1259.94 --> 1262.63
that's what you get

1268.25 --> 1283.85
Selin alien to see you and Ray see I

1273.559 --> 1286.22
rule yeah and David read low so yeah

1283.85 --> 1288.86
nice of you to join this join me on this

1286.22 --> 1297.89
33rd episode

1288.86 --> 1300.58
Flat Earth early bird and so what else

1297.89 --> 1300.5800000000002
can we talk about

1306.98 --> 1311.72
[Music]

1310.03 --> 1314.77
Ronny fashi

1311.72 --> 1314.77
see you

1325.69 --> 1330.3
hello and there's ace leaf is a thief

1334.2 --> 1346.3500000000001
how's that okay thank you look

1355.02 --> 1361.789
the greens scream earth spinning what

1365.09 --> 1371.3899999999999
what is that supposed to be

1378.97 --> 1388.45
oh it's I think that's just an animation

1385.06 --> 1391.3899999999999
that's given public that people can use

1388.45 --> 1396.04
if they want to have a globe on a green

1391.39 --> 1402.3600000000001
screen thingy so I think it's mostly a

1396.04 --> 1405.25
problem for people like for example Hari

1402.36 --> 1406.3899999999999
because he typically uses a lot of green

1405.25 --> 1409.21
screen thingies

1406.39 --> 1413.16
so he could use this perhaps I don't

1409.21 --> 1427.26
know I don't see what's so special about

1413.16 --> 1427.26
TRO matters maybe I got the wrong thing

1435.33 --> 1443.9499999999998
okay all right

1441.24 --> 1451.21
doesn't seem to be very cosmogony

1443.95 --> 1453.91
related I will take a full look at it's

1451.21 --> 1456.45
a five-minute video so thanks for

1453.91 --> 1459.21
sharing that I'll take a look later

1456.45 --> 1467.17
apparently narrated by belief is a thief

1459.21 --> 1470.38
no one out back I'll just share it don't

1467.17 --> 1475.48
know what it is exactly

1470.38 --> 1478.3600000000001
I think it's probably about just a more

1475.48 --> 1481.57
general thing about how media is fooling

1478.36 --> 1489.24
us and keeping us in a false reality

1481.57 --> 1489.24
that kind of thing anyway

1506.86 --> 1510.279
forgive me celli

1521.149 --> 1523.7489999999998
what

1524.75 --> 1529.0
what are you talking about

1540.85 --> 1549.2099999999998
oh right conspiracy cat yeah I know

1543.61 --> 1557.9799999999998
conspiracy cats is a weirdo globert that

1549.21 --> 1561.97
is yeah he is what he is don't worry I I

1557.98 --> 1563.71
know him his name has been brought up on

1561.97 --> 1564.759
the Flat Earth debates many times so

1563.71 --> 1567.549
don't worry about it

1564.759 --> 1573.1
hey anybody can be in this chat as long

1567.549 --> 1577.019
as you behave so don't go all fighting

1573.1 --> 1577.019
like a bunch of cats in my chat please

1582.12 --> 1591.129
not here yeah Eric I know I knew all

1588.059 --> 1594.61
everything it's always about the state

1591.129 --> 1596.6789999999999
everything ever ever done wrong is

1594.61 --> 1599.799
always by government I know

1596.679 --> 1605.259
because people don't do things only

1599.799 --> 1608.549
government people don't do bad things

1605.259 --> 1608.549
only government does right

1622.08 --> 1627.4299999999998
and hey I don't like the government okay

1625.72 --> 1631.96
I don't like the concept

1627.43 --> 1639.49
it's a giant waste resources giant giant

1631.96 --> 1642.91
waste its misplace is power so yeah I am

1639.49 --> 1645.61
a much more libertarian orientated

1642.91 --> 1646.21
person I'm not an anarchist absolutely

1645.61 --> 1650.6699999999998
not

1646.21 --> 1650.67
I think it's extremely impractical and

1653.28 --> 1661.03
because of human nature in tenable it's

1657.37 --> 1664.27
not durable can persist it's gonna just

1661.03 --> 1667.0
people are gonna just hostile take over

1664.27 --> 1669.55
the [ __ ] out of people yeah out of

1667.0 --> 1674.41
states that just stop it and and

1669.55 --> 1677.23
energize so ya know libertarianism much

1674.41 --> 1679.8700000000001
better small mic broke off from it very

1677.23 --> 1682.81
direct democracy directed by the people

1679.87 --> 1688.6599999999999
like a People's Council Internet is

1682.81 --> 1691.84
perfect for this and ya treat government

1688.66 --> 1694.39
like corporations for hire not a

1691.84 --> 1697.72
constantly necessarily functioning thing

1694.39 --> 1701.38
but just something that like government

1697.72 --> 1706.45
organs that can simply be fired by the

1701.38 --> 1708.88
people directly just been that kind of

1706.45 --> 1712.39
thing and get other car we have to have

1708.88 --> 1715.71
a line up of these corporations because

1712.39 --> 1720.25
yeah you're gonna have to pay them well

1715.71 --> 1722.71
that's the thing can be like if you're

1720.25 --> 1724.63
gonna have a solid constant government

1722.71 --> 1727.78
yeah you want to keep their wages

1724.63 --> 1730.0500000000002
minimum in return for the power they

1727.78 --> 1734.77
will have but if you're gonna have like

1730.05 --> 1737.6399999999999
temp system for government hire yet they

1734.77 --> 1740.65
will if they're gonna be lining up and

1737.64 --> 1743.76
competing they're gonna have to be paid

1740.65 --> 1746.8300000000002
a little bit better but that is

1743.76 --> 1748.81
compensated by not having constantly

1746.83 --> 1752.1999999999998
having to pay for all these government

1748.81 --> 1755.71
systems all the time as a standard so

1752.2 --> 1758.3500000000001
it's much more tenable in my opinion

1755.71 --> 1763.18
and the technology allows it so I'm very

1758.35 --> 1768.1899999999998
much a internet democracy libertarian

1763.18 --> 1770.3500000000001
and still a nationalist in that sense I

1768.19 --> 1773.8600000000001
think national boundaries are very

1770.35 --> 1776.5
important also for the identity but yeah

1773.86 --> 1781.12
when actual internet democracy sets in

1776.5 --> 1787.0
on a wider variety then potentially

1781.12 --> 1789.85
provinces and yeah they could much

1787.0 --> 1792.91
easier become self-sufficient they could

1789.85 --> 1796.24
much easier split off or even parts of

1792.91 --> 1798.3100000000002
countries could decide like yeah you

1796.24 --> 1802.15
know what it's always been working very

1798.31 --> 1804.1599999999999
nicely or it's been tolerable but we are

1802.15 --> 1806.8000000000002
now going to join that other country

1804.16 --> 1809.71
that does it more our way because yeah

1806.8 --> 1813.19
it's a democracy it's not going to be

1809.71 --> 1815.8600000000001
you look if a certain region just says

1813.19 --> 1818.8500000000001
ok no we want this we want that then

1815.86 --> 1826.9799999999998
they are gonna do that that's gonna be

1818.85 --> 1830.32
yeah like a basically a giant

1826.98 --> 1832.66
amalgamation of provinces everywhere of

1830.32 --> 1836.35
regions that will make their own

1832.66 --> 1838.69
decisions and yet being part of a bigger

1836.35 --> 1841.1499999999999
hole does have advantages and it does

1838.69 --> 1843.31
have some disadvantages and that's the

1841.15 --> 1846.5500000000002
way it's gonna it's gonna be much more

1843.31 --> 1850.12
flexible and yeah anything could happen

1846.55 --> 1852.61
from this but I think it is a much more

1850.12 --> 1858.03
sensible approach than just outright

1852.61 --> 1861.6399999999999
Anarchy where yeah that can work until

1858.03 --> 1865.48
somebody or a group just decides that

1861.64 --> 1872.5
the hostile takeover and it will happen

1865.48 --> 1874.1200000000001
it always does really can can't really

1872.5 --> 1878.02
prevent it so that's not a durable

1874.12 --> 1880.3899999999999
solution not really it's in its again

1878.02 --> 1887.05
it's an idealism that just doesn't work

1880.39 --> 1888.72
in my opinion or at least not now you

1887.05 --> 1892.71
know even

1888.72 --> 1894.99
with the libertarianism if we if that

1892.71 --> 1897.54
actually becomes a bigger thing if

1894.99 --> 1900.78
demands even liberate ourselves from the

1897.54 --> 1902.76
current system and get that done if that

1900.78 --> 1907.41
spreads out then who knows maybe

1902.76 --> 1914.37
eventually it will progress further into

1907.41 --> 1916.89
a form of anarchism where it's yeah it

1914.37 --> 1919.05
will work because everybody has the

1916.89 --> 1922.0500000000002
skills everybody has the tools everybody

1919.05 --> 1925.95
has the right mindset but you can't just

1922.05 --> 1928.5
switch your energies and from this type

1925.95 --> 1931.65
of system because the vacuum of power

1928.5 --> 1934.2
will just be filled again you have to

1931.65 --> 1936.18
build it down first you have to do

1934.2 --> 1937.95
gradually otherwise it's gonna be filled

1936.18 --> 1942.9
by some party that's just going to

1937.95 --> 1946.43
decide to fill it whether people protest

1942.9 --> 1946.43
it or fight against it or not

1960.549 --> 1969.879
so I think the most viable progression

1965.489 --> 1974.169
for the the counter movement to the new

1969.879 --> 1977.769
world order to be the new neo feudal

1974.169 --> 1980.6190000000001
system that is trying to be integrated

1977.769 --> 1987.7
everywhere through globalism as some

1980.619 --> 1994.269
call it or the anti human agenda I think

1987.7 --> 1999.849
that the most viable solution is a mix

1994.269 --> 2002.609
of well these powerhouses these bigger

1999.849 --> 2005.519
countries that have big armies yeah you

2002.609 --> 2008.2189999999998
can they are not gonna drop that trust

2005.519 --> 2011.039
me they aren't so they're gonna be like

2008.219 --> 2012.8690000000001
that but all other countries don't

2011.039 --> 2015.809
necessarily have to screw themselves

2012.869 --> 2021.7389999999998
over so it could be a mix of basically

2015.809 --> 2026.609
these financial empires and libertarian

2021.739 --> 2028.799
provinces everywhere and that's very

2026.609 --> 2034.049
interesting how that can work out so I'm

2028.799 --> 2036.32
very curious to see yeah because in a

2034.049 --> 2040.019
way I guess that if everything is

2036.32 --> 2042.299
libertarian and as I said like in

2040.019 --> 2045.389
control on people or the people in

2042.299 --> 2051.119
control through internet voting and just

2045.389 --> 2056.399
limited corporation government then that

2051.119 --> 2059.73
is it is completely decentralized in a

2056.399 --> 2062.94
way but it is kind of another globalism

2059.73 --> 2065.97
but a good kind kind of makes sense a

2062.94 --> 2068.669
kind that retains people's dignity and

2065.97 --> 2075.98
freedom and freedom of choice all that

2068.669 --> 2078.8089999999997
kind of thing and yeah an equal equal

2075.98 --> 2081.299
yeah I have some actual you don't need

2078.809 --> 2083.2200000000003
any more representation you prep resent

2081.299 --> 2089.579
yourself and you have an equal vote that

2083.22 --> 2092.549
kind of thing and NSA and yeah that will

2089.579 --> 2094.6490000000003
then eventually be next to the financial

2092.549 --> 2099.61
empires and

2094.649 --> 2103.77
yeah could go either way they they could

2099.61 --> 2107.28
just want to take it all over and then

2103.77 --> 2109.63
we have problem or they will adapt and

2107.28 --> 2113.73
eventually kind of do the same thing and

2109.63 --> 2117.19
then it will be a giant world of

2113.73 --> 2120.25
libertarian provinces everywhere with

2117.19 --> 2122.9500000000003
strong financial prophesies corporations

2120.25 --> 2127.09
between provinces that are considered

2122.95 --> 2130.87
like regional then they may still call

2127.09 --> 2138.4
them nations but that's only nations by

2130.87 --> 2140.56
concentration so that's I don't it's

2138.4 --> 2154.65
kind of far away we still have to get

2140.56 --> 2154.65
through this period and skate all right

2159.5 --> 2167.69
yeah the funny thing was Ares I actually

2163.49 --> 2170.56
called it libertarian communism the

2167.69 --> 2173.84
funny thing is is that

2170.56 --> 2176.15
yeah communism of course like the

2173.84 --> 2180.26
current format and how it even sprung up

2176.15 --> 2186.92
is it's like a tyrannical government

2180.26 --> 2189.8900000000003
with with a community social

2186.92 --> 2193.58
conditioning and and structure an organ

2189.89 --> 2199.52
an organ way of organizing but yeah in

2193.58 --> 2202.16
my sense the libertarian communism would

2199.52 --> 2207.349
not be real communism it would only be

2202.16 --> 2210.29
the culture from the actual like trying

2207.349 --> 2213.05
to really take responsibility yeah it's

2210.29 --> 2216.65
not coming it's localism so libertarian

2213.05 --> 2219.7400000000002
localism and the communism has some

2216.65 --> 2221.9300000000003
really good cultural elements to it and

2219.74 --> 2226.1299999999997
yeah it shouldn't be all thrown away

2221.93 --> 2230.839
because yeah people should just be

2226.13 --> 2233.69
social and help out each other but yeah

2230.839 --> 2236.24
it's not I guess it's just not really

2233.69 --> 2240.7400000000002
communism it is well what communism

2236.24 --> 2242.6299999999997
pretends to be but really doesn't work

2240.74 --> 2250.8999999999996
out that well it's only on the surface

2242.63 --> 2255.01
so we have not communism I guess maybe

2250.9 --> 2255.01
just libertarian community

2260.04 --> 2268.61
a combine of world provinces yeah

2276.45 --> 2284.73
yeah yeah I guess is use you're right

2279.35 --> 2287.88
yeah and that's I guess it is almost the

2284.73 --> 2291.62
same as if with flat earthers I would

2287.88 --> 2295.29
talk about gravity and a lot in yeah

2291.62 --> 2300.18
the we are now conditioned with

2295.29 --> 2301.95
communism to not be fooled by the

2300.18 --> 2306.1499999999996
superficial illusion of what it

2301.95 --> 2308.04
currently is but again because of this

2306.15 --> 2311.87
because of the circumstances because of

2308.04 --> 2316.38
the way communism is applied right now

2311.87 --> 2320.63
we all and including myself tend to over

2316.38 --> 2323.58
generalize it and not really look at

2320.63 --> 2327.21
what some good parts are about it

2323.58 --> 2330.15
although they're basically just side

2327.21 --> 2336.89
effects comfort to the overall picture

2330.15 --> 2341.2200000000003
that in that it has as an influence so

2336.89 --> 2344.5499999999997
yeah there's some good lessons to be

2341.22 --> 2349.5899999999997
learned from communism and not just from

2344.55 --> 2354.38
the negative aspects of it and yeah I

2349.59 --> 2358.32
think that the human society can learn a

2354.38 --> 2364.38
lot from it and it has I think that many

2358.32 --> 2369.53
people have what now hasn't be had not

2364.38 --> 2369.53
outright hilarious no

2374.4 --> 2378.6600000000003
yeah at first I didn't even I wasn't

2376.74 --> 2384.5699999999997
even too sure what all tried really was

2378.66 --> 2386.8799999999997
I thought it was just like a a counter

2384.57 --> 2391.29
group to defend against the white

2386.88 --> 2394.56
genocide agenda basically the the

2391.29 --> 2398.73
globalism white genocide agenda which is

2394.56 --> 2400.59
real yeah it is and that sensible to me

2398.73 --> 2405.66
but then I heard that they were like

2400.59 --> 2408.6600000000003
really apparently they were kind of

2405.66 --> 2412.0499999999997
racist or it's um clear I don't know I

2408.66 --> 2415.0499999999997
should really look into it more about

2412.05 --> 2417.4500000000003
what what they themselves do currently

2415.05 --> 2421.77
to judge them properly because you get

2417.45 --> 2425.46
so yeah through others you will get so

2421.77 --> 2430.1
many negativity about them unsure to

2425.46 --> 2430.1
even see if it's all real you know

2430.16 --> 2434.67
everything that said so I don't know

2432.27 --> 2439.56
what the you know alt-right is I don't

2434.67 --> 2442.71
know any all right people if I am a

2439.56 --> 2447.96
libertarian and I have conservative

2442.71 --> 2452.4
elements to me and I have liberal

2447.96 --> 2456.63
elements to me and I try to take both

2452.4 --> 2461.79
and apply them in libertarianism so that

2456.63 --> 2464.6400000000003
freedom will always be the greater

2461.79 --> 2468.93
choice and that is very liberal really

2464.64 --> 2471.24
but at the same time not following the

2468.93 --> 2474.06
typical liberal principles of big

2471.24 --> 2477.7099999999996
government absolutely the opposite that

2474.06 --> 2483.12
sense I am conservative can be done and

2477.71 --> 2485.34
yeah so it used to be very liberal and

2483.12 --> 2487.8599999999997
then I figured out okay some of this

2485.34 --> 2491.46
liberal stuff is nonsensical is idiotic

2487.86 --> 2493.7400000000002
is delusional and not you gonna pursue

2491.46 --> 2496.8
this because it's not gonna heal the

2493.74 --> 2500.3399999999997
result that is claimed it is it's just

2496.8 --> 2504.2000000000003
stupid and I really don't like ultra

2500.34 --> 2504.2000000000003
conservatives because they seem

2505.24 --> 2510.1
they look too much like devil

2507.34 --> 2514.63
persecutors to me they act too much like

2510.1 --> 2517.15
this and I don't know I think that some

2514.63 --> 2518.2000000000003
things should be changed although it is

2517.15 --> 2520.21
like Oh God

2518.2 --> 2524.08
let's bring in another loaded subject

2520.21 --> 2530.26
goody so people are gonna be complaining

2524.08 --> 2535.45
about this but I am kind of pro-choice

2530.26 --> 2538.69
in a sense but with a big butt

2535.45 --> 2541.33
yeah I'm not a fan for promoting this

2538.69 --> 2543.2200000000003
and especially not for culturally

2541.33 --> 2547.63
promoting it through media like it's a

2543.22 --> 2552.85
cool thing and should not be encouraged

2547.63 --> 2555.31
but should not be forbidden and it

2552.85 --> 2559.0299999999997
should be approached as damage control

2555.31 --> 2561.82
basically that's how I think it should

2559.03 --> 2566.71
be approached but to outright forbid

2561.82 --> 2574.09
it's ridiculous yeah freedom again

2566.71 --> 2576.63
freedom so important and yeah you can

2574.09 --> 2581.05
consider it as absolutely disgusting and

2576.63 --> 2583.23
murder and all that stuff but rights

2581.05 --> 2588.4900000000002
okay if you're gonna complain about that

2583.23 --> 2590.56
then maybe some less personal things

2588.49 --> 2600.18
would be more appropriate to approach

2590.56 --> 2602.7
like constant Wars and just

2600.18 --> 2606.0699999999997
destabilizing other countries and just

2602.7 --> 2609.1899999999996
that kind of [ __ ] you know I think that

2606.07 --> 2611.2000000000003
personal issues should be left to the

2609.19 --> 2614.53
person really and in that sense again I

2611.2 --> 2617.77
am a liberal and not for like promoting

2614.53 --> 2619.8100000000004
it I'm not for oh yeah just like oh here

2617.77 --> 2621.94
get your free vaccine like oh yeah or

2619.81 --> 2628.21
get your free abortion absolutely not

2621.94 --> 2631.869
ridiculous no but yeah forbidding it no

2628.21 --> 2636.1
and yeah sure I think that the pro-life

2631.869 --> 2639.17
were should absolutely give people that

2636.1 --> 2641.71
are like considering for good reason

2639.17 --> 2648.4900000000002
Worsham to give them alternatives

2641.71 --> 2651.71
absolutely and I'd even not complain if

2648.49 --> 2654.77
as a compensation they would want that

2651.71 --> 2656.9900000000002
to be mandated yeah it's been annoying I

2654.77 --> 2660.5
guess but may help prevent like all

2656.99 --> 2664.0989999999997
these mobsters can do this they get like

2660.5 --> 2665.21
okay they can officially offer it but

2664.099 --> 2668.7200000000003
done forbid it

2665.21 --> 2671.27
very simple much better solution

2668.72 --> 2673.4599999999996
everybody it gives you more options it

2671.27 --> 2675.74
gets more freedom everybody gets a

2673.46 --> 2678.14
little what they want it can't have it

2675.74 --> 2682.99
completely your way you can't have

2678.14 --> 2685.99
absolutes it's just not gonna work out

2682.99 --> 2685.99
so

2687.95 --> 2694.81
right like my colon works that you can't

2691.3 --> 2701.9300000000003
pleasing both sides can't do it

2694.81 --> 2711.35
indeed so better to just yeah bring out

2701.93 --> 2715.1
the options that's that's my exit point

2711.35 --> 2718.46
like make sure don't just don't force

2715.1 --> 2721.2799999999997
anything basically don't force people to

2718.46 --> 2728.93
pay for others don't

2721.28 --> 2733.6600000000003
this allow personal conduct except if

2728.93 --> 2739.31
you literally yeah hurts but another

2733.66 --> 2740.54
walking being another born being yeah so

2739.31 --> 2743.21
yeah that's where they're allowed

2740.54 --> 2745.4
goddesses always so controversial of

2743.21 --> 2749.45
course I know I know I've heard all the

2745.4 --> 2753.02
arguments I've heard all the obsession

2749.45 --> 2755.96
of oh my god this this almost child is

2753.02 --> 2759.02
so amazing all the potential you can

2755.96 --> 2765.83
have or kill it ever and it's just all

2759.02 --> 2772.55
of it's murder and seriously like I like

2765.83 --> 2777.11
I do see the good in humans but oh my

2772.55 --> 2781.4300000000003
god you know there's a limit there's a

2777.11 --> 2784.1600000000003
limit to how far you should job is like

2781.43 --> 2789.94
yeah it's almost like oh god we love

2784.16 --> 2789.94
humans so much we're just gonna like now

2790.42 --> 2794.96
everybody's gonna be forced to get

2793.13 --> 2797.51
children like yeah if you're a woman

2794.96 --> 2800.0
you've gotta get at least five children

2797.51 --> 2805.9900000000002
everyone in the world oh god it's so

2800.0 --> 2805.99
good yeah is that gonna be good you know

2806.11 --> 2814.06
gonna make it it's gonna trash the

2810.08 --> 2817.21
world's nuts locally but resource wise

2814.06 --> 2820.36
yeah it's gonna trash the world

2817.21 --> 2823.36
short-term solutions

2820.36 --> 2826.0
will absolutely destroy the world in

2823.36 --> 2829.98
that sense and so yeah you know

2826.0 --> 2834.55
population growth has certain advantages

2829.98 --> 2838.96
you can't hurry it up too much in this

2834.55 --> 2843.54
age you know not until you can already

2838.96 --> 2846.82
account for the inevitable results of

2843.54 --> 2860.95
population growth so you gotta be

2846.82 --> 2866.01
careful yeah in that sense I'm also

2860.95 --> 2871.7799999999997
liberal I don't I don't buy the idea

2866.01 --> 2875.9100000000003
that God wants us to overpopulate this

2871.78 --> 2879.82
[ __ ] out of this world is realm and just

2875.91 --> 2883.33
like act like a bunch of bacteria I

2879.82 --> 2885.3300000000004
don't think that's the creator's plan at

2883.33 --> 2888.19
all and I don't think it could happen

2885.33 --> 2891.1
because you get the mice in a cage

2888.19 --> 2893.38
effect yeah they may postpone that by oh

2891.1 --> 2895.18
yeah we're so yeah we can do we can do

2893.38 --> 2897.31
it because we're sending billions of

2895.18 --> 2899.0499999999997
people out into space to another planet

2897.31 --> 2899.65
but yeah as soon as that's just not

2899.05 --> 2904.15
gonna happen

2899.65 --> 2906.07
chaos it's gonna be like too many mice

2904.15 --> 2907.63
in a cage they're gonna attack each

2906.07 --> 2909.7000000000003
other they're gonna even eat each other

2907.63 --> 2912.9100000000003
it's a natural result of being

2909.7 --> 2919.41
overcrowded in a confined space it's

2912.91 --> 2923.56
natural so we have to prevent that

2919.41 --> 2926.89
really do it doesn't mean that we have

2923.56 --> 2931.81
to reduce down to zero population to

2926.89 --> 2936.25
five hundred thousands no that's it's a

2931.81 --> 2938.62
bit too much you know we have a lot

2936.25 --> 2940.03
going including nature conservation if

2938.62 --> 2942.8199999999997
you're going to remove all the people

2940.03 --> 2947.53
then also everything is going to be

2942.82 --> 2952.05
destroyed as well but would be wise to

2947.53 --> 2952.05
just try to keep it stable

2953.67 --> 2961.42
so simple to keep it stable and that's

2958.51 --> 2967.1800000000003
statistically a good solution to that

2961.42 --> 2972.55
and that is that every every person in

2967.18 --> 2976.0299999999997
their life on average should have one

2972.55 --> 2979.2400000000002
kid and that means you're gonna have it

2976.03 --> 2981.46
with another person so every two person

2979.24 --> 2985.1499999999996
should have to statistically

2981.46 --> 2987.43
two-and-a-half kids cuz yeah not

2985.15 --> 2997.4500000000003
literally of course but on average like

2987.43 --> 3003.0299999999997
2/3 that would be good but yeah the

2997.45 --> 3005.58
thing is about it at least yeah more

3003.03 --> 3007.2000000000003
than half of them should be properly

3005.58 --> 3009.44
educated if they're gonna be just

3007.2 --> 3011.8799999999997
sitting around doing nothing

3009.44 --> 3014.61
look we're sucking while I'm not doing

3011.88 --> 3017.9
nothing anyway not now I used to bear to

3014.61 --> 3022.02
do anything that's not gonna help

3017.9 --> 3028.9100000000003
so yeah productivity in a sense not like

3022.02 --> 3036.5099999999998
the stateliest productivity but being

3028.91 --> 3041.18
social and just trying to clean up the

3036.51 --> 3044.19
place would be good trying to find

3041.18 --> 3048.3599999999997
technological solutions to pollution

3044.19 --> 3050.4500000000003
problems look I'm still I don't know if

3048.36 --> 3052.6200000000003
you guys even know this but I am a huge

3050.45 --> 3055.08
environmentalist myself I've been grown

3052.62 --> 3056.8199999999997
up in a family that was very much aware

3055.08 --> 3058.68
about environmentalism

3056.82 --> 3062.3700000000003
I'm all for recycling although it has

3058.68 --> 3064.0499999999997
its problems it can be approved upon I

3062.37 --> 3066.66
see points of improvement I wish

3064.05 --> 3069.21
probably gonna be like in 20 years or

3066.66 --> 3071.52
something I might actually be in circles

3069.21 --> 3073.65
that I could try to do something with it

3071.52 --> 3075.68
maybe sooner I don't know what what's

3073.65 --> 3082.7400000000002
gonna happen to me

3075.68 --> 3085.89
but yeah environmentalism is very

3082.74 --> 3086.37
important to me and I want nature to

3085.89 --> 3089.1299999999997
throw

3086.37 --> 3092.87
I've not just survive but thrive because

3089.13 --> 3096.0
if nature thrive humans thrive as well

3092.87 --> 3097.98
if we don't let nature thrive then

3096.0 --> 3100.56
humans don't thrive and they will be

3097.98 --> 3103.26
more inclined to actually destroy more

3100.56 --> 3105.87
of nature to try and thrive again this

3103.26 --> 3111.98
is what freaking constantly happens and

3105.87 --> 3114.3599999999997
I'm so so sick of it so sick of this

3111.98 --> 3121.28
stupidity that causes unnecessary

3114.36 --> 3125.9700000000003
destruction and I just want it to stop I

3121.28 --> 3130.9100000000003
really do I really do and just shouldn't

3125.97 --> 3130.91
be necessary and it isn't necessary so

3131.39 --> 3136.89
so many ways to get things without

3134.06 --> 3141.57
destroying others destroying things

3136.89 --> 3146.1299999999997
destroying nature yeah like I don't

3141.57 --> 3149.9700000000003
think that all oil production should be

3146.13 --> 3152.7000000000003
banned I don't think yeah even with oil

3149.97 --> 3154.5
although it is literally quite polluting

3152.7 --> 3158.6899999999996
but I think there is a solution to the

3154.5 --> 3162.39
remnant toxic materials that even they

3158.69 --> 3165.9
they could be transformed into a less

3162.39 --> 3168.24
harmful substance or actually and then

3165.9 --> 3177.05
maybe be applied in some way I think

3168.24 --> 3182.9399999999996
that the potential for for chemistry is

3177.05 --> 3184.5600000000004
has become much wider with some of the

3182.94 --> 3187.19
new technologies that are coming to

3184.56 --> 3191.04
light especially like the test level

3187.19 --> 3192.84
high electricity things I think that we

3191.04 --> 3196.79
are coming to the point where we can

3192.84 --> 3200.76
chemically almost transform anything

3196.79 --> 3203.58
split it up and relatively efficiently

3200.76 --> 3206.9700000000003
so I think that the nature of like pure

3203.58 --> 3211.11
true recycling can happen and that'll

3206.97 --> 3214.52
just make it possible to not keep up

3211.11 --> 3217.11
giant amounts of trash or burn it and

3214.52 --> 3219.53
yeah we do that in the Netherlands

3217.11 --> 3222.7200000000003
have actually a power plant running on

3219.53 --> 3225.42
garbage and I guess that is kind of good

3222.72 --> 3227.97
but it still has remnants are see stuff

3225.42 --> 3231.59
that nothing can be done with this and I

3227.97 --> 3236.1299999999997
think thinking about it that even that

3231.59 --> 3241.4700000000003
junk that poisons dust poisoned ashes

3236.13 --> 3246.15
can basically be extracted can be

3241.47 --> 3250.43
filtered and purified so that the purely

3246.15 --> 3253.5
toxic elements can be molecularly rised

3250.43 --> 3256.02
completely separated and the rest just

3253.5 --> 3260.31
yeah wouldn't be toxic anymore and could

3256.02 --> 3262.58
be used for whatever just ashes can be

3260.31 --> 3265.2599999999998
used in gardening whatever and

3262.58 --> 3268.67
potentially eventually even like the

3265.26 --> 3272.82
most toxic substances could just be

3268.67 --> 3276.51
transformed rather into a more original

3272.82 --> 3281.6400000000003
state where it can just be reapplied in

3276.51 --> 3286.44
industry so all this idea that there's

3281.64 --> 3291.45
always somewhere some kind of pile of in

3286.44 --> 3294.8
tenable toxins piling up that is the

3291.45 --> 3299.8199999999997
biggest long-term problem of current

3294.8 --> 3303.09
humanity and I want to solve this I want

3299.82 --> 3307.9100000000003
to absolutely solve it completely and I

3303.09 --> 3312.0
think it can be done I really do

3307.91 --> 3316.7999999999997
so yeah and at the same time yeah please

3312.0 --> 3318.9
please get some more co2 in the air

3316.8 --> 3321.48
because we need it you know nature

3318.9 --> 3322.88
thrive and see you too a lot and so do

3321.48 --> 3326.97
we

3322.88 --> 3332.94
plants grow bigger faster produce more

3326.97 --> 3336.66
food and we get more oxygen at the same

3332.94 --> 3341.07
time so yeah the biggest problem in this

3336.66 --> 3344.37
world a pollution wise is everything

3341.07 --> 3346.4700000000003
except co2 co2 is non pollutant

3344.37 --> 3349.7599999999998
it's actually a good substance that's

3346.47 --> 3350.85
very essential for nature to thrive and

3349.76 --> 3353.4300000000003
the

3350.85 --> 3358.08
real problems are the actual poisons are

3353.43 --> 3363.1499999999996
the poison and remnants the benzenes

3358.08 --> 3367.52
from fuel that leaked out for example

3363.15 --> 3367.52
that's really poisonous to nature and

3368.15 --> 3376.9500000000003
things like sodium fluoride which is

3372.3 --> 3379.23
also an industrial and by-product it's

3376.95 --> 3381.27
access they can't get rid of it it is

3379.23 --> 3383.1
actually yeah that it's a remnant that's

3381.27 --> 3387.03
that poison that sodium so that's what

3383.1 --> 3391.0499999999997
they put in your freaking toothpaste but

3387.03 --> 3395.28
you know what I mean this substance

3391.05 --> 3397.53
should be transformable into something

3395.28 --> 3401.3700000000003
completely harmless or potentially even

3397.53 --> 3403.7000000000003
useful that's one of the things that I

3401.37 --> 3408.0899999999997
want to see happening and I think I

3403.7 --> 3412.43
believe and I've seen it through my

3408.09 --> 3417.56
visions that it is possible I believe it

3412.43 --> 3421.47
absolutely believe it and love to

3417.56 --> 3424.64
brainstorm with specialists like

3421.47 --> 3429.3599999999997
Chemical specialists recycling

3424.64 --> 3432.87
industrialists about this and see step

3429.36 --> 3436.86
by step if each toxin can be analyzed

3432.87 --> 3440.16
and just figured out how to solve that

3436.86 --> 3445.65
problem how to solve that that part of

3440.16 --> 3451.1
the chain loved to do it so anybody out

3445.65 --> 3453.9900000000002
there sees this as a connection or has a

3451.1 --> 3460.31
has an idea in the similar direction

3453.99 --> 3460.31
yeah contact me I'll do it for free

3463.57 --> 3478.3590000000004
so yeah I've been going an hour now got

3469.58 --> 3482.0
15 more minutes yep right

3478.359 --> 3486.2
that's funny Ian Adam says America is

3482.0 --> 3492.29
making diesels from the east right well

3486.2 --> 3496.43
I am not much a fan of biofuel at all

3492.29 --> 3503.9
I think biofuel is a terrible terrible

3496.43 --> 3506.68
thing because you don't need it not like

3503.9 --> 3510.05
that anyway I think that the only

3506.68 --> 3514.1299999999997
biofuel that is sustainable for the

3510.05 --> 3517.63
future is algae based and the funny

3514.13 --> 3519.17
thing is told these people ten years ago

3517.63 --> 3523.6400000000003
that's new

3519.17 --> 3529.06
no it's gonna be algae based so algae

3523.64 --> 3532.0099999999998
based fuel could be kind of viable but

3529.06 --> 3534.97
yes till the co2 and that's just gonna

3532.01 --> 3539.0200000000004
be there so and that's actually not bad

3534.97 --> 3543.47
but I think that if we manage to find

3539.02 --> 3547.94
ways to transform the toxic wastes from

3543.47 --> 3550.52
oil production fuel production that that

3547.94 --> 3555.2000000000003
it's it's everywhere

3550.52 --> 3555.7
oil is everywhere why it's why not use

3555.2 --> 3558.47
it

3555.7 --> 3563.0499999999997
the only reason not to use is the Rd

3558.47 --> 3563.0499999999997
byproducts really in my opinion and

3563.26 --> 3568.5800000000004
pollution danger also they should be

3565.49 --> 3570.3199999999997
worked on but it's gotta improve you

3568.58 --> 3573.2599999999998
know when materials improve strength

3570.32 --> 3575.48
improves then comes less and less

3573.26 --> 3580.369
dangerous can handle more and more

3575.48 --> 3583.66
abrupt or certain shifts and forces and

3580.369 --> 3586.19
everything so it becomes more safe and

3583.66 --> 3589.49
yeah the only real problem are the

3586.19 --> 3593.02
byproducts so yeah let's deal with the

3589.49 --> 3596.3399999999997
byproducts let's get this chemical

3593.02 --> 3599.77
revolution going

3596.34 --> 3602.44
where we actually start to really dig in

3599.77 --> 3604.45
and find solutions to the byproducts

3602.44 --> 3609.19
that are just gonna increase it's just

3604.45 --> 3613.45
gonna increase you know like even

3609.19 --> 3616.32
garbage like junk from society can we

3613.45 --> 3620.77
recycle in the sense that it can be

3616.32 --> 3626.26
burned or whatever used like that that's

3620.77 --> 3630.52
better than just having billions of

3626.26 --> 3633.61
drums of pure toxic wastes just piling

3630.52 --> 3636.55
up growing because yeah you can't just

3633.61 --> 3638.2000000000003
oh let's you're gonna have to store it

3636.55 --> 3641.5600000000004
somewhere and it's always gonna be

3638.2 --> 3644.35
freakin toxic so that is much bigger

3641.56 --> 3649.9
problem than even the trash from society

3644.35 --> 3652.11
gotta keep that in mind so let's solve

3649.9 --> 3652.11
it

3658.01 --> 3664.5200000000004
hmm right okay so people have joined the

3663.54 --> 3668.4
chat

3664.52 --> 3678.75
Karen be Popeye hello Karen Ann owns

3668.4 --> 3693.38
flour good to see you both chuckling say

3678.75 --> 3693.38
in oh I so busy bein Adams right

3696.03 --> 3703.8300000000004
right yeah Karen be about the oil I

3699.0 --> 3710.58
think that you also heard the story that

3703.83 --> 3714.54
how oil abiotic oil the black goo that

3710.58 --> 3717.99
comes out of the ground is basically

3714.54 --> 3719.79
created not yeah not through the

3717.99 --> 3722.37
nonsense story that they gave us about

3719.79 --> 3726.57
rotting plants but that it is literally

3722.37 --> 3730.65
bacteria in the rock that just transform

3726.57 --> 3734.7000000000003
the rock into oil so yeah the amount is

3730.65 --> 3738.48
gonna keep on growing potentially for a

3734.7 --> 3740.97
long long time and theoretically if it

3738.48 --> 3745.13
goes on forever then we might end up

3740.97 --> 3751.74
just sitting on a completely dirt less

3745.13 --> 3753.81
giant oil blob hopefully in big boats

3751.74 --> 3756.6
just drifting on the freakin oil because

3753.81 --> 3759.24
all the rocks all gonna be oil oh yeah I

3756.6 --> 3761.1
guess that water is gonna be sitting on

3759.24 --> 3764.7799999999997
top of it so we'll be drifting on an

3761.1 --> 3768.69
ocean and underneath the ocean would be

3764.78 --> 3772.77
a hundred million or a hundred thousand

3768.69 --> 3775.68
miles of oil so yeah that's kind of a

3772.77 --> 3779.52
scary outlook hopefully we could like

3775.68 --> 3781.29
stop that process from continuing at

3779.52 --> 3783.87
some point because I don't want to I

3781.29 --> 3788.43
don't want humanity to end up on giant

3783.87 --> 3791.94
boats in an ocean on top of oil and

3788.43 --> 3795.8599999999997
that's it's just a giant giant realm of

3791.94 --> 3795.86
oil that would suck

3801.92 --> 3812.1
so yeah oil is easy but the side effects

3810.63 --> 3815.1
that's gonna be a problem

3812.1 --> 3817.56
we need we need a function for these

3815.1 --> 3821.25
functions we need them to be able to

3817.56 --> 3824.87
become something that we can use that's

3821.25 --> 3830.73
not gonna be a long-term toxic problem

3824.87 --> 3833.99
if we get that done man I seriously I

3830.73 --> 3837.81
wouldn't care if everybody would be

3833.99 --> 3842.39
driving Hummers all day long and gas

3837.81 --> 3848.48
would be one cent again in current but I

3842.39 --> 3852.3599999999997
fine but only if those freaking toxic

3848.48 --> 3855.27
wastes if that stuff can be completely

3852.36 --> 3859.26
neutralized that's the requirement for

3855.27 --> 3864.09
that for me personally if it has no ill

3859.26 --> 3867.09
side effects no gathering problem then

3864.09 --> 3872.2400000000002
why not use it no problem and the same

3867.09 --> 3874.9100000000003
by the way goes for terrestrial gas like

3872.24 --> 3880.0099999999998
yeah what's the problem

3874.91 --> 3883.98
gas is extremely clean it literally has

3880.01 --> 3886.59
well as good as no chemical side ways

3883.98 --> 3890.94
this just burns up get a bunch of

3886.59 --> 3893.76
carbons and co2 and it's really harmless

3890.94 --> 3896.85
so absolutely gas should always be used

3893.76 --> 3898.9500000000003
and I can't stand that they're climbing

3896.85 --> 3902.48
on in the Netherlands trying to get a

3898.95 --> 3907.1699999999996
gas free policy ridiculous absolutely

3902.48 --> 3908.88
ridiculous cuz yeah that just means that

3907.17 --> 3911.01
everything is going to be electricity

3908.88 --> 3916.08
run and yeah where's the electricity

3911.01 --> 3919.05
going to be coming from from some plants

3916.08 --> 3919.92
from solar cells how far can those go I

3919.05 --> 3921.42
don't think so

3919.92 --> 3923.91
we're already using a lot of electricity

3921.42 --> 3925.59
if now we're gonna like take away the

3923.91 --> 3927.7799999999997
gas and replace it all with the

3925.59 --> 3930.9500000000003
electricity that's gonna be just more

3927.78 --> 3930.9500000000003
electricity and more

3931.84 --> 3937.9900000000002
of whatever that's coming from it might

3934.42 --> 3940.63
even end up so ridiculous that gas is

3937.99 --> 3943.9599999999996
going to be used extra to power the

3940.63 --> 3946.9300000000003
power plants to provide the electricity

3943.96 --> 3949.06
that is required for not being allowed

3946.93 --> 3953.23
to use gas I'm serious

3949.06 --> 3955.81
that's could end up becoming a result

3953.23 --> 3959.32
it's so stupid and it's wasteful because

3955.81 --> 3963.24
yeah gas it's very efficient

3959.32 --> 3965.8300000000004
it burns locally does it sting

3963.24 --> 3968.0499999999997
electricity you're gonna burn it in a

3965.83 --> 3973.95
power plant and electricity it's gonna

3968.05 --> 3977.98
lose its power over distance so it's

3973.95 --> 3980.6499999999996
absolutely ridiculously inefficient to

3977.98 --> 3984.84
apply it like this gas should not be

3980.65 --> 3987.28
removed it's a good source it's very

3984.84 --> 3990.82
environmentally friendly just a bunch of

3987.28 --> 4004.1400000000003
co2 exactly what nature needs it's

3990.82 --> 4012.32
perfect yeah right so I'm just talking

4004.14 --> 4015.06
about the current ways how fossil fuels

4012.32 --> 4017.7000000000003
it's not even even the water it is a lie

4015.06 --> 4021.39
it's not a freaking fossil fuel yeah

4017.7 --> 4023.85
fuels yeah why not use them I don't have

4021.39 --> 4028.3799999999997
I don't object at all as long as there's

4023.85 --> 4029.97
no toxic waste as a side effect and yeah

4028.38 --> 4033.42
yeah we know

4029.97 --> 4035.6699999999996
electricity can potentially be tapped

4033.42 --> 4041.21
out of the ether there's new ways of

4035.67 --> 4045.51
doing that but you have to keep in mind

4041.21 --> 4049.02
use that energy that means displacing it

4045.51 --> 4052.0200000000004
how is it gonna affect the overall thing

4049.02 --> 4054.09
let's just say that everything that we

4052.02 --> 4056.04
do new do now with electricity and

4054.09 --> 4058.9500000000003
creating fossil fuels that we suddenly

4056.04 --> 4062.1
would switch to all these towers tapping

4058.95 --> 4064.14
that electricity out of the sky you

4062.1 --> 4065.5499999999997
think that's not gonna have some kind of

4064.14 --> 4070.16
side effect

4065.55 --> 4072.6000000000004
you know maybe this happened before

4070.16 --> 4075.24
maybe it has a side effect if you do

4072.6 --> 4078.39
that maybe that is what actually by

4075.24 --> 4082.29
itself by the increase in energy tapping

4078.39 --> 4085.89
that cost the mud flood you can say that

4082.29 --> 4089.369
that so you always have to be careful

4085.89 --> 4092.64
with assuming that some new thing is

4089.369 --> 4096.27
gonna be the infinite solution because

4092.64 --> 4098.759
it never turns out to be that let's be

4096.27 --> 4102.6900000000005
realistic every time there's something

4098.759 --> 4104.99
new discovered always oh my god this is

4102.69 --> 4106.95
the thing that's gonna solve everything

4104.99 --> 4111.96
let's say what they thought about

4106.95 --> 4114.24
nuclear power you know every time that's

4111.96 --> 4116.339
what people assume they dive onto it and

4114.24 --> 4118.799
then it turns out oh [ __ ] it does have

4116.339 --> 4122.609
side effects it does have a downside or

4118.799 --> 4126.7699999999995
there is a limit always to us so let's

4122.609 --> 4130.02
be realistic even about the the

4126.77 --> 4133.31
electrostatic energy that we could use

4130.02 --> 4139.650000000001
there's there might be limit to this and

4133.31 --> 4143.25
even the controllers may know this so we

4139.65 --> 4146.679999999999
don't know the rules of what happens

4143.25 --> 4148.13
when you use this we we did we have no

4146.68 --> 4153.900000000001
[Music]

4148.13 --> 4157.799
real data about this we have suspicions

4153.9 --> 4159.839
I have suspicions we have some hidden

4157.799 --> 4163.0199999999995
history that's being revealed but

4159.839 --> 4166.109
there's no direct just declarations like

4163.02 --> 4171.06
yeah this happened right right there

4166.109 --> 4176.400000000001
because of this no nothing written about

4171.06 --> 4179.279
this not that I know maybe maybe we'll

4176.4 --> 4181.95
take out some journal somewhere from the

4179.279 --> 4185.25
AG that actually does said that would be

4181.95 --> 4189.54
absolutely astounding but I kind of

4185.25 --> 4193.109
doubt kind of doubted if he had it then

4189.54 --> 4195.99
he would be almost crying of enthusiasm

4193.109 --> 4198.09
because it's like such radical thing to

4195.99 --> 4199.2
come across something like that we would

4198.09 --> 4201.54
know by now

4199.2 --> 4204.51
you would have not be able to postpone

4201.54 --> 4206.13
such things revealing that but who knows

4204.51 --> 4206.610000000001
maybe in the future he will find

4206.13 --> 4212.37
something

4206.61 --> 4215.16
yes a lot of good sources so yeah well

4212.37 --> 4217.65
man I've managed to actually talk 1 hour

4215.16 --> 4220.07
and 15 minutes all by myself pretty much

4217.65 --> 4228.12
non-stop I'm impressed

4220.07 --> 4229.74
30 third episode early bird I'm gonna

4228.12 --> 4231.54
round out to show guys it's been a

4229.74 --> 4233.88
pleasure to have you a lot of

4231.54 --> 4236.94
conversation in chat it's good to see

4233.88 --> 4242.22
you guys waking up and active I am

4236.94 --> 4245.3099999999995
working on an intro that's that's

4242.22 --> 4248.79
actually starting to manifest slowly I

4245.31 --> 4252.410000000001
hope to apply it at some point you will

me talking for 72 minutes I'll be back

4275.58 --> 4281.37

4278.19 --> 4283.679999999999
tomorrow and I will be joining Flat

4281.37 --> 4290.87
Earth debates right after the video has

4283.68 --> 4293.87
ended so until the next time keep it

4290.87 --> 4293.87
