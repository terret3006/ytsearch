124.24 --> 128.51999999999998
sharing the show on twitter

131.84 --> 134.959
little extra routine

138.64 --> 141.64
right

144.56 --> 149.28
so yeah the weather today is

146.8 --> 152.28
it's still hot but

149.28 --> 152.28
ugh

157.04 --> 162.959
not as hot as yesterday i mean yesterday

159.519 --> 162.959
was just insane

163.519 --> 167.68
i went

164.64 --> 170.319
i went through the weather

167.68 --> 174.0
like later in the afternoon and that was

170.319 --> 174.0
like almost a mistake because

174.48 --> 178.959
like it just felt like my skin was

176.56 --> 181.36
burning off from the heat

178.959 --> 183.68
it was so incredibly hot but right now

181.36 --> 186.48000000000002
there's a little bit more cloudiness

183.68 --> 188.87900000000002
some haze there's been trails left also

186.48 --> 191.35999999999999
that i could see

188.879 --> 193.44
but yeah there's a lot more wind today

191.36 --> 195.92000000000002
like constantly

193.44 --> 199.68
and that's really nice

195.92 --> 201.44
so it has cooled down

199.68 --> 204.56
compared to yesterday but it's still

201.44 --> 204.56
just freaking hot

205.36 --> 207.92000000000002
but better

209.599 --> 213.44
and it's actually kind of nice if you

211.36 --> 216.0
sit in the shadow right now

213.44 --> 216.0
the breeze

224.879 --> 230.959
hello elise g first in chat gadget

227.599 --> 233.51899999999998
inspector snowbirds price of adam pjc

230.959 --> 233.519
net wow

235.439 --> 240.56
good to see you all

237.12 --> 242.72
much cooler in england yeah i bet i mean

240.56 --> 244.64000000000001
if it's gonna cool down here that much

242.72 --> 247.2
it's gonna cool down in england as well

244.64 --> 247.2
so good

248.0 --> 252.959
people can finally do something again

250.08 --> 255.84
because that heat is just

252.959 --> 255.84
like yesterday i

257.44 --> 262.16
i was just like constantly just uh

263.36 --> 267.759
just waiting for the heat to go down

265.6 --> 272.28000000000003
because she can't do anything

267.759 --> 272.28000000000003
can barely focus when it's that hot

282.24 --> 287.28000000000003
hey clutch uh yeah you saw you saw me on

285.199 --> 288.639
gym up in the chat

287.28 --> 293.35999999999996
yeah that's where i came up with the

288.639 --> 293.36
title for today's show pen sword apple

293.84 --> 298.63899999999995
and

295.199 --> 298.639
yeah it is basically a

300.16 --> 306.0
newtonian

302.639 --> 308.88
in newtonian inspired

306.0 --> 312.479
rock paper scissor

308.88 --> 314.71999999999997
except of rock it's an apple instead of

312.479 --> 317.199
paper it's a sword and instead of a

314.72 --> 319.52000000000004
scissor it's a pen

317.199 --> 319.52000000000004
right

321.68 --> 324.40000000000003
so

322.72 --> 327.36
it starts with the pen

324.4 --> 330.15999999999997
is mightier than the sword

327.36 --> 332.16
but the sword is mightier

330.16 --> 336.91900000000004
than the apple

332.16 --> 336.91900000000004
and the apple is mightier than the pen

344.16 --> 347.16
right

352.16 --> 354.16
yeah

353.28 --> 356.55999999999995
you

354.16 --> 359.03900000000004
like this way like rock paper scissors

356.56 --> 361.44
is like really materialistic

359.039 --> 363.919
right it's just objects

361.44 --> 365.199
and one object destroys or wraps or

363.919 --> 367.12
whatever

365.199 --> 369.199
on this case it's much more like

367.12 --> 372.0
philosophically rooted

369.199 --> 374.479
because pen of course stands for

372.0 --> 378.0
philosophy

374.479 --> 379.68
potentially science diplomacy right or

378.0 --> 381.84
bureaucracy

379.68 --> 383.84000000000003
well sword is kind of obvious what that

381.84 --> 386.23999999999995
stands for

383.84 --> 386.23999999999995
it's like

386.479 --> 388.71999999999997
well

389.36 --> 394.12
more like

390.319 --> 394.12
militant or

394.639 --> 400.16
you could say police force would be

396.96 --> 402.31899999999996
sword you know what i mean right

400.16 --> 403.84000000000003
uh enforcement

402.319 --> 405.84000000000003
arms uh

403.84 --> 409.919
and then the apple of course well yeah

405.84 --> 412.08
that's food so that would be like

409.919 --> 414.71999999999997
farming

412.08 --> 416.8
right so you got

414.72 --> 418.319
the military

416.8 --> 419.68
farmers

418.319 --> 422.72
and the

419.68 --> 424.24
thinkers politician bureaucrats

422.72 --> 426.319
right

424.24 --> 428.8
like those are three distinct groups and

426.319 --> 430.8
it's interesting to then like rock paper

428.8 --> 432.88
scissor

430.8 --> 434.88
like those concepts think about it like

432.88 --> 436.15999999999997
yeah

434.88 --> 439.039
like the pen

436.16 --> 440.56
could potentially

439.039 --> 442.639
like

440.56 --> 444.96
subdue the sword

442.639 --> 447.44
could gain control of the sword

444.96 --> 448.84
while the sword could like

447.44 --> 451.28
use pure

448.84 --> 453.19899999999996
force to

451.28 --> 455.11999999999995
like yeah crush down

453.199 --> 458.16
on the farmers

455.12 --> 460.639
but the farmers could starve

458.16 --> 463.44
the bureaucrats

460.639 --> 465.36
huh huh

463.44 --> 467.12
isn't that interesting

465.36 --> 469.039
suddenly it's like yeah it's like oh

467.12 --> 472.8
wrote paper scissors

469.039 --> 472.8
what's special about that well

473.84 --> 479.84
if you turn it into pen sword apple

477.12 --> 479.84000000000003
then

482.479 --> 486.8
the context

483.84 --> 489.19899999999996
can be a little broader

486.8 --> 492.479
military don't eat

489.199 --> 494.479
of course they eat

492.479 --> 497.36
but the military could literally just

494.479 --> 499.599
bust into a farm and just say like yeah

497.36 --> 501.44
give us food or

499.599 --> 504.15999999999997
we're just gonna take it

501.44 --> 505.36
right that's the point

504.16 --> 506.96000000000004
they have that

505.36 --> 509.91900000000004
particular edge because of their

506.96 --> 513.36
specialization

509.919 --> 514.959
right the bureaucrats don't have that

513.36 --> 516.479
but

514.959 --> 518.64
they

516.479 --> 520.719
like especially in times of prosperity

518.64 --> 523.36
can just like

520.719 --> 525.6800000000001
gain control of the military

523.36 --> 528.399
right it's yeah i mean this is like

525.68 --> 528.399
historical

532.32 --> 536.08
so that was just a thingy

536.72 --> 542.64
a little moment that still in the heat i

539.12 --> 542.64
came up with yesterday

544.88 --> 547.12
uh

547.44 --> 550.9590000000001
oh right

548.399 --> 554.48
yeah that happened yesterday

550.959 --> 554.4799999999999
uh i didn't see it live though

554.8 --> 560.519
but yeah reflect curvature went up

557.519 --> 560.519
against

562.08 --> 568.88
against ruiff what was it

566.16 --> 572.68
25 interrupted minutes of roofie begging

568.88 --> 572.68
the question oh jesus

576.08 --> 581.6
yeah i know john was gonna do fine i

578.56 --> 583.3599999999999
mean that guy is like immune to stress

581.6 --> 584.72
or something

583.36 --> 588.399
so

584.72 --> 588.399
but i'd be curious to hear it back

588.8 --> 593.12
was it on youtube is there do you have a

591.04 --> 596.12
link or something

593.12 --> 596.12

632.399 --> 637.04
the sun a

634.079 --> 637.04
chalk burn

642.8 --> 647.1999999999999
anyway wow you guys are chatty today

647.26 --> 650.47
[Music]

657.839 --> 662.24
all right yeah thanks for the link

661.04 --> 664.56
oh

662.24 --> 665.92
by the way

664.56 --> 669.3599999999999
a bit late

665.92 --> 672.36
but it is wednesday the 20th of july

669.36 --> 672.36
2022

704.88 --> 711.2
okay well at least roof looks less

707.68 --> 711.1999999999999
unbelievably unhealthy

711.44 --> 716.2
that's good for him at least

733.2 --> 737.0400000000001
proven angle is two straight lines oh

735.76 --> 739.4399999999999
god yeah

737.04 --> 742.3199999999999
dude but you got to realize make dune is

739.44 --> 745.7600000000001
a full on anti-flat earther

742.32 --> 748.639
and so the rest so they are gonna they

745.76 --> 750.639
are just going to be now attacking us

748.639 --> 753.6
over

750.639 --> 756.16
us using the words and the definitions

753.6 --> 758.0790000000001
as they were originally meant

756.16 --> 762.24
and they're now

758.079 --> 762.2399999999999
gonna i guess attack us on that then

763.2 --> 767.76
like proven angle is two straight lines

769.36 --> 772.9590000000001
they're just gonna straight out ask that

771.519 --> 775.2
yeah

772.959 --> 776.56
i did kind of or it was predicted i

775.2 --> 778.1600000000001
predicted it

776.56 --> 781.56
and so have others on the flat earth

778.16 --> 781.56
debate team

784.19 --> 787.379
[Music]

790.0 --> 793.959
super chat yeah of course

800.0 --> 803.839
i mean what is

801.519 --> 806.0
like they're not gonna get any more

803.839 --> 806.71
excitement than an actual flat earth

806.0 --> 808.56
debater

806.71 --> 810.399
[Music]

808.56 --> 813.5999999999999
getting on their show so everybody's

810.399 --> 815.12
just gonna squirt and throw money at it

813.6 --> 817.6800000000001
because that gives them an impression

815.12 --> 819.839
that they might be somewhat competent

817.68 --> 822.079
somehow again

819.839 --> 822.0790000000001
right

822.09 --> 826.24
[Music]

824.48 --> 829.76
yeah the only way to prevent that is to

826.24 --> 831.519
just never ever go on on their channels

829.76 --> 835.4399999999999
ever

831.519 --> 835.44
that's really the only way to avoid that

840.32 --> 846.48
it was a setup john should have he did

842.639 --> 846.48
know gadget inspector he did

847.519 --> 851.12
like in the after show he already talked

850.0 --> 853.519
about it

851.12 --> 856.079
and predicted that

853.519 --> 858.399
yeah that he was going to get set up

856.079 --> 858.399
right

858.56 --> 861.5189999999999
it was hard to watch

864.639 --> 868.48
why

865.68 --> 871.68
why is that hard to watch

868.48 --> 873.6800000000001
i mean are we defeated

871.68 --> 876.0
by that [ __ ] and the rumpusing and

873.68 --> 879.8389999999999
the straw man and

876.0 --> 882.24
like how dare you what do you what

879.839 --> 886.24
like basic concepts that are the

882.24 --> 887.199
foundation of logic and reality

886.24 --> 889.76
what

887.199 --> 892.079
since when is that reality right if

889.76 --> 894.399
they're going to be like that

892.079 --> 898.5999999999999
what does it matter they're just making

894.399 --> 898.6
fools of themselves then

899.519 --> 904.5600000000001
although yeah it is not pleasurable

902.639 --> 906.8
i get that

904.56 --> 909.3599999999999
but like to say it's hard to watch

906.8 --> 911.5999999999999
that's like oh it's so tough like no

909.36 --> 913.6800000000001
it's just a waste of time

911.6 --> 915.9200000000001
it's just them acting like complete

913.68 --> 918.16
morons

915.92 --> 920.399
and

918.16 --> 925.56
john not getting a word in between i

920.399 --> 925.56
take it that's usually how that goes so

926.36 --> 933.279
[Music]

930.88 --> 935.68
maybe the globers will get ballsy again

933.279 --> 936.639
try to bring something to the debate

935.68 --> 941.2399999999999
no

936.639 --> 941.24
no the price of adam they're not

941.36 --> 944.8000000000001
they're going to do more of this

943.12 --> 948.0
nonsense

944.8 --> 950.88
laying down questions about foundational

948.0 --> 952.399
concepts like what is an angle

950.88 --> 955.04
since when do you need two straight

952.399 --> 956.0
lines in out to get an angle

955.04 --> 958.16
right

956.0 --> 960.24
that's what they're going to be throwing

958.16 --> 963.04
that specifically is what they're going

960.24 --> 964.8
to be throwing at us not something that

963.04 --> 969.079
actually has a point

964.8 --> 969.079
they're all out of points

979.04 --> 981.36
right

981.759 --> 989.24
they're here to make a hassle and bring

984.32 --> 989.24
a point and they're all out of points

1002.88 --> 1008.4399999999999
yeah price of adam hey nathan oakley

1005.04 --> 1008.4399999999999
good to see you

1013.93 --> 1017.04
[Music]

1020.399 --> 1025.12
no what do you mean no

1023.759 --> 1029.959
is

1025.12 --> 1029.9589999999998
no you're agreeing with me okay

1030.619 --> 1033.6889999999999
[Music]

1047.76 --> 1052.8799999999999
ah i'm really happy by way of having

1049.919 --> 1055.2
this cooling elements

1052.88 --> 1057.679
from the freezer

1055.2 --> 1060.679
it's a great way to keep bottled water

1057.679 --> 1060.679
cool

1066.75 --> 1070.94
[Music]

1075.84 --> 1080.32
how long

1077.6 --> 1082.559
well the show was 2 hours and 18 minutes

1080.32 --> 1086.08
i don't know how much of it

1082.559 --> 1086.08
john was actually active

1090.64 --> 1096.72
he hadn't

1091.919 --> 1098.88
dropped or anything until the show ended

1096.72 --> 1101.1200000000001
so i think he's just there the full show

1098.88 --> 1101.1200000000001
then

1101.919 --> 1106.1200000000001
probably muted a lot

1126.4 --> 1130.4
it was a yeah no [ __ ]

1128.559 --> 1132.48
hello

1130.4 --> 1135.96
hello

1132.48 --> 1135.96
price of adam

1136.88 --> 1142.96
what you're surprised like he knew

1140.08 --> 1144.24
we literally discussed like a week ahead

1142.96 --> 1146.0
of time

1144.24 --> 1148.559
because he's been planning this for uh

1146.0 --> 1152.559
we discussed like how is he going to be

1148.559 --> 1155.039
set up okay we literally did like

1152.559 --> 1158.08
role playing sort of

1155.039 --> 1162.16
about it scenario sketching

1158.08 --> 1164.559
because yeah duh it was gonna get set up

1162.16 --> 1166.48
of course that's what they always do

1164.559 --> 1171.36
always

1166.48 --> 1174.16
always like find me a single exception

1171.36 --> 1179.36
there isn't any if they plan a show

1174.16 --> 1182.16
with a flat earther it's a setup always

1179.36 --> 1186.12
i've never seen a single exception

1182.16 --> 1186.1200000000001
in like seven years

1192.64 --> 1197.3600000000001
all right and it yeah you what you think

1196.559 --> 1199.039
that

1197.36 --> 1200.6399999999999
it's like

1199.039 --> 1202.4
below them

1200.64 --> 1204.64
to just

1202.4 --> 1207.2
give a false premise as to what the show

1204.64 --> 1208.96
is about invite somebody on that false

1207.2 --> 1211.76
premise and then just do something

1208.96 --> 1212.48
completely different what

1211.76 --> 1214.24
like

1212.48 --> 1216.96
have you never seen that before they do

1214.24 --> 1216.96
it all the time

1217.36 --> 1222.799
they just like change the rules or they

1220.32 --> 1222.799
whatever

1223.28 --> 1228.48
they do whatever they want

1226.0 --> 1230.159
they feel like they don't need to stick

1228.48 --> 1234.44
to rules only

1230.159 --> 1234.44
when it is convenient to them

1260.559 --> 1263.84
you have to start from a plane and would

1262.24 --> 1267.1200000000001
know that yeah

1263.84 --> 1267.12
that was the entire point

1269.039 --> 1273.8799999999999
that's like that's john's thing

1276.0 --> 1280.24
and he knew that yeah they won't they

1278.32 --> 1282.32
wouldn't answer that question and that

1280.24 --> 1284.4
the rest of the show would be filler i'm

1282.32 --> 1286.6399999999999
quite frankly i'm surprised he

1284.4 --> 1288.159
he held in there for like two hours like

1286.64 --> 1290.88
why

1288.159 --> 1294.24
but i guess you said that he had some

1290.88 --> 1296.0800000000002
interesting arguments afterward so

1294.24 --> 1298.64
but i haven't seen it yet i will i will

1296.08 --> 1298.6399999999999
check it out

1300.159 --> 1305.159
hey jedo

1301.76 --> 1305.1589999999999
let's see you

1318.0 --> 1322.24
what is the temperature right now let me

1320.08 --> 1322.24
check

1322.32 --> 1326.799
oh by the way my twitter is already

1324.559 --> 1328.32
getting stalked by the same shitty ass

1326.799 --> 1329.6
trolls

1328.32 --> 1333.4399999999998
that do that

1329.6 --> 1334.7199999999998
on youtube goody

1333.44 --> 1336.799
but

1334.72 --> 1339.84
i think there's a much more effective

1336.799 --> 1339.84
way to block them

1341.6 --> 1345.039
because yeah i've actually tried to

1343.679 --> 1346.64
block

1345.039 --> 1348.8799999999999
like people

1346.64 --> 1350.72
that comment constantly that like

1348.88 --> 1354.0
they've been doing that for

1350.72 --> 1356.799
seven years actually some of them

1354.0 --> 1358.32
but it doesn't work

1356.799 --> 1361.52
youtube just

1358.32 --> 1363.52
doesn't block them

1361.52 --> 1365.6
right just like oh yeah it will block

1363.52 --> 1368.559
them and then like the next day you'll

1365.6 --> 1370.0
see a new comment from those people

1368.559 --> 1372.799
again

1370.0 --> 1374.88
so it just doesn't do that

1372.799 --> 1377.28
well i think that twitter does actually

1374.88 --> 1377.2800000000002
do that

1378.4 --> 1383.6000000000001
we'll see

1380.0 --> 1383.6
or we'll not see i hope

1386.48 --> 1389.6
right

1387.6 --> 1392.1589999999999
it's very typical because one of these

1389.6 --> 1394.08
posts i made on twitter was

1392.159 --> 1394.72
about

1394.08 --> 1397.769
um

1394.72 --> 1397.769
[Music]

1401.679 --> 1405.44
right it was it was the question about

1404.32 --> 1407.84
the flight

1405.44 --> 1410.64
pass over the flat earth and all that

1407.84 --> 1412.9599999999998
and specifically asking

1410.64 --> 1415.2
other flat earthers and then of course

1412.96 --> 1418.32
the global start blabbering and like

1415.2 --> 1420.88
responding to that well specifically in

1418.32 --> 1422.6399999999999
the question was like other flat

1420.88 --> 1424.7990000000002
earthers

1422.64 --> 1424.7990000000002
so

1426.0 --> 1432.48
they're just spamming [ __ ]

1428.84 --> 1434.08
uh don't feed the trolls

1432.48 --> 1435.84
feed the arwin

1434.08 --> 1438.24
thank you for that matthew hall thank

1435.84 --> 1440.6399999999999
you for the super chat

1438.24 --> 1440.64
indeed

1441.76 --> 1446.96
by the way i did also get a paypal

1444.32 --> 1448.72
yesterday from somebody but i'm not sure

1446.96 --> 1450.0
who it was

1448.72 --> 1452.799
i'm not going to just

1450.0 --> 1452.799
say their name

1453.679 --> 1459.039
but beside dank who also donated

1456.559 --> 1462.96
yesterday somebody else and i want to

1459.039 --> 1462.96
thank them a lot it was great

1465.52 --> 1467.9189999999999
anyway

1470.159 --> 1473.4
hey youtube

1480.64 --> 1485.8400000000001
john didn't have anything because they

1482.32 --> 1487.039
still failed from the 90 degree go

1485.84 --> 1490.24
yes

1487.039 --> 1493.52
that makes sense surprise of adam but

1490.24 --> 1494.96
did john keep trying to remind them

1493.52 --> 1496.72
about it like

1494.96 --> 1499.1200000000001
that's

1496.72 --> 1501.3600000000001
you're not answering that part like you

1499.12 --> 1502.8799999999999
can't move on beyond that if you just

1501.36 --> 1504.3999999999999
kept doing that that would have been

1502.88 --> 1506.5590000000002
perfect

1504.4 --> 1509.2
right this the second you let them go

1506.559 --> 1511.44
you let them back the question it's over

1509.2 --> 1513.3600000000001
they'll it'll just be an infinite

1511.44 --> 1515.8400000000001
blabbering and they'll feel all great

1513.36 --> 1515.84
about it

1520.14 --> 1527.039
[Music]

1525.039 --> 1529.04
did john do good i don't know jedi i

1527.039 --> 1531.52
haven't seen it yet but there is a link

1529.04 --> 1534.24
[Music]

1531.52 --> 1534.24

1556.08 --> 1559.4399999999998
[Music]

1560.08 --> 1563.1999999999998

1569.679 --> 1573.6000000000001
youtube what the [ __ ] are you doing dude

1574.08 --> 1580.72

1577.36 --> 1582.7199999999998
vanishing it's because i'm gonna ban you

or time you out for acting like an

1582.72 --> 1585.72
[ __ ]

1586.159 --> 1589.919
yeah

1587.12 --> 1593.9189999999999
pgcnet simply is

1589.919 --> 1597.679
critical against flat earth activity

1593.919 --> 1599.3600000000001
and he is not going over any lines

1597.679 --> 1602.48
right

1599.36 --> 1604.8799999999999
i mean sometimes i am dissatisfied about

1602.48 --> 1608.88
like how certain people of the flat

1604.88 --> 1611.0390000000002
earth debates are presenting themselves

1608.88 --> 1613.1200000000001
or like tactical decisions they make in

1611.039 --> 1614.32
some discussion

1613.12 --> 1616.8799999999999
right

1614.32 --> 1619.2
that doesn't mean oh it's just

1616.88 --> 1623.48
you're secretly an anti-flat earther now

1619.2 --> 1623.48
that's [ __ ] youtube

1632.72 --> 1638.93
what are you talking about

1635.74 --> 1638.93
[Music]

1645.52 --> 1648.62
that's what happened what what gadgets

1647.679 --> 1651.74
what happened

1648.62 --> 1651.7399999999998
[Music]

1653.76 --> 1657.919
all right

1655.36 --> 1657.9189999999999
never mind

1664.88 --> 1670.5590000000002
the stuff he posts in chats on boiler

1667.279 --> 1672.72
debates okay well pgcnet

1670.559 --> 1675.039
you want to explain what that is are you

1672.72 --> 1677.039
trying to infiltrate them pose as an

1675.039 --> 1677.65
anti-flat earther

1677.039 --> 1679.52
i mean

1677.65 --> 1683.8400000000001
[Music]

1679.52 --> 1683.84
i've tried to do that in the past

1686.08 --> 1691.9189999999999
right in a way i do that myself in qe

1689.52 --> 1694.32
live show in the chat chat skanking i

1691.919 --> 1697.5200000000002
call it

1694.32 --> 1702.12
start the joke and poke around sort of

1697.52 --> 1702.12
trolling but not full on

1711.2 --> 1717.1200000000001
oh okay youtube yes you can be food

1714.48 --> 1719.919
can't get food again

1717.12 --> 1719.9189999999999
come on dude

1721.279 --> 1728.24
youtube make sure you stay hydrated

1724.96 --> 1728.24
you might be having a

1728.64 --> 1732.24
some judgment issues here

1736.0 --> 1740.48
seen it too many times yeah and i've

1737.84 --> 1744.32
seen you become hysterical for no damn

1740.48 --> 1746.3990000000001
reason too many times youtube

1744.32 --> 1748.559
and then afterward it's like yeah a week

1746.399 --> 1751.4399999999998
later oh like nothing happened yeah it

1748.559 --> 1753.12
did happen you acted hysterically

1751.44 --> 1755.919
again

1753.12 --> 1758.6399999999999
so that's what you're now doing i'm very

1755.919 --> 1762.5200000000002
damn certain that pjcnet is not secretly

1758.64 --> 1762.5200000000002
an anti-flat earther

1770.44 --> 1774.079
[Music]

1774.559 --> 1778.1589999999999
right

1775.76 --> 1781.84
john just shouldn't have agreed

1778.159 --> 1781.8400000000001
to it toons terms

1782.88 --> 1786.3200000000002
okay well yeah that's your opinion

1785.52 --> 1789.279
but

1786.32 --> 1791.6789999999999
you have to realize that john was

1789.279 --> 1794.799
basically like he knew he was gonna get

1791.679 --> 1798.5590000000002
set up and he did it anyway because he

1794.799 --> 1798.559
wanted to accomplish something

1802.159 --> 1807.92
now whether that succeeded or not i

1805.039 --> 1811.089
don't know because i haven't watched it

1807.92 --> 1811.0890000000002
[Music]

1812.559 --> 1816.84
i knew he was gonna do it

1818.23 --> 1821.289
[Music]

1828.64 --> 1832.64
all right so yeah basically tune

1830.559 --> 1835.279
demanded that they fall

1832.64 --> 1838.0800000000002
that they started out

1835.279 --> 1839.12
with them just being able to

1838.08 --> 1842.96
just

1839.12 --> 1845.36
yeah as you say rip into him

1842.96 --> 1849.6000000000001
they just needed to do their thing

1845.36 --> 1850.399
before they would just let him go ahead

1849.6 --> 1853.7199999999998
right

1850.399 --> 1853.7199999999998
very typical

1878.48 --> 1881.919
okay

1879.679 --> 1885.519
yeah so youtube

1881.919 --> 1888.0800000000002
dude i'd laugh about that

1885.519 --> 1890.88
it is funny

1888.08 --> 1893.279
i mean is it not funny that john just is

1890.88 --> 1896.64
like no i i'm not i didn't bring a

1893.279 --> 1899.679
presentation why would i do that

1896.64 --> 1901.919
you already did the presentations that i

1899.679 --> 1901.919
need

1903.039 --> 1908.0
i mean what

1904.48 --> 1909.2
you expect flat earthers to make more

1908.0 --> 1912.159
effort

1909.2 --> 1915.1200000000001
or anti-flag earthers that are blaze

1912.159 --> 1918.24
blatantly trying to set them up really

1915.12 --> 1920.9599999999998
youtube you expect

1918.24 --> 1923.1200000000001
expect that npgnet

1920.96 --> 1924.64
you're expecting flat earthers to make

1923.12 --> 1926.6399999999999
more effort

1924.64 --> 1928.96
for when they engage

1926.64 --> 1931.8400000000001
in a situation when they know they're

1928.96 --> 1934.08
going to obviously be set up

1931.84 --> 1935.6
really you expect him to make more

1934.08 --> 1937.84
effort do you

1935.6 --> 1937.84
why

1938.799 --> 1941.9189999999999
would you

1940.64 --> 1945.3990000000001
really

1941.919 --> 1945.3990000000001
would you really

1963.36 --> 1966.0
oh no

1967.039 --> 1973.919
oh well youtube oh

1970.88 --> 1976.0
well you know what email nathan oakley

1973.919 --> 1978.0800000000002
about it okay

1976.0 --> 1981.36
and just tell them like oh there's this

1978.08 --> 1983.039
peaches cnet going around

1981.36 --> 1986.0
and when john

1983.039 --> 1989.44
didn't bring an actual presentation to

1986.0 --> 1992.96
make two nonsense debate

1989.44 --> 1995.8400000000001
then pgcnet started to make fun of him

1992.96 --> 2000.48
so he's probably an anti-flat earth or

1995.84 --> 2002.24
infiltrating oh yes oh

2000.48 --> 2005.679
such a good

2002.24 --> 2007.84
good point there you great

2005.679 --> 2011.24
tactical genius man what will we do

2007.84 --> 2011.24
without you

2019.919 --> 2025.919
you got over 150 points you've been

2022.08 --> 2028.24
raising for the last seven years wow

2025.919 --> 2028.24
and

2030.24 --> 2036.559
what are you gonna do with that

2033.6 --> 2038.399
i mean what you want to be the next rv

2036.559 --> 2041.12
or something

2038.399 --> 2044.08
seriously youtube

2041.12 --> 2046.7199999999998
why don't you just go make videos then

2044.08 --> 2048.56
make videos about how everybody secretly

2046.72 --> 2051.119
anti-flat earth

2048.56 --> 2052.24
why don't you just go do that then

2051.119 --> 2056.32
because

2052.24 --> 2059.04
i never heard of your 150 points

2056.32 --> 2061.76
i've heard from people that you

2059.04 --> 2064.079
get really weird in chats and like kind

2061.76 --> 2065.599
of paranoid and

2064.079 --> 2069.119
accusatory

2065.599 --> 2069.119
that's what i heard about you

2069.359 --> 2074.639
what has rv got to do with making points

2072.24 --> 2076.879
points about what

2074.639 --> 2079.679
about how you believe

2076.879 --> 2082.0
that certain flat earthers in chat are

2079.679 --> 2087.0
secretly anti-flat earthers that seem

2082.0 --> 2087.0
pretty damn rv to me youtube

2090.96 --> 2096.7200000000003
eastward speed up thing

2094.32 --> 2097.76
oh wow okay so you're a better flat

2096.72 --> 2101.2799999999997
earther

2097.76 --> 2103.76
then you're better at it

2101.28 --> 2106.32
i i don't see what you're doing here i

2103.76 --> 2106.32
don't get it

2109.28 --> 2114.4
he doesn't open dude just shut up man

2112.8 --> 2115.28
just take five

2114.4 --> 2117.28
just

2115.28 --> 2121.6400000000003
go away

2117.28 --> 2121.6400000000003
this is absolute horror [ __ ]

2133.92 --> 2139.88
he's just going nuts again probably has

2136.0 --> 2139.88
a heat stroke or something

2149.119 --> 2153.04
i told you to stay hydrated

2156.16 --> 2161.5989999999997
because if you don't with that sun you

2158.88 --> 2163.2000000000003
go nuts you typically grow aggressive

2161.599 --> 2165.44
and paranoid

2163.2 --> 2165.4399999999996
huh

2165.52 --> 2169.44
i don't even know where i am right now

2171.359 --> 2174.4
you smoke too much

2174.48 --> 2177.92
that's your freaking issue

2180.16 --> 2183.2
hey yout

2181.839 --> 2184.88
[ __ ] off

2183.2 --> 2188.3199999999997
[ __ ] off yout

2184.88 --> 2188.32
i gave you a timeout

2191.359 --> 2198.119
giving you a timeout

2194.079 --> 2198.119
because you're being [ __ ]

2200.96 --> 2204.2400000000002
you're being [ __ ]

2210.16 --> 2212.3999999999996
yeah

2212.64 --> 2217.839
i know he he logged into another account

2215.839 --> 2220.4
like a troll

2217.839 --> 2222.4
so maybe it is time to actually start

2220.4 --> 2224.4
banning him because i'm timing him out

2222.4 --> 2225.52
because he's being paranoid and he's

2224.4 --> 2226.64
attacking

2225.52 --> 2229.68
actual

2226.64 --> 2233.04
loyal flat earth contributors huh

2229.68 --> 2235.04
youtube how much have you contributed

2233.04 --> 2237.119
to the scene

2235.04 --> 2240.4
youtube

2237.119 --> 2242.96
with your [ __ ] chill accusations

2240.4 --> 2244.0
i'd say that you're a shill

2242.96 --> 2246.56
yeah

2244.0 --> 2248.079
just like rv you're the guy that's that

2246.56 --> 2253.24
you're the one that's attacking

2248.079 --> 2253.2400000000002
everybody and not actually supporting

2261.44 --> 2265.839
not are you no it is the same

2263.76 --> 2269.6400000000003
it is the same guy he has multiple

2265.839 --> 2269.64
accounts like a troll

2271.64 --> 2274.77
[Music]

2276.8 --> 2280.4
yeah

2277.68 --> 2281.52
yeah good fair enough point

2280.4 --> 2284.8
but

2281.52 --> 2288.88
john wasn't really there to entertain

2284.8 --> 2288.88
anti-flat earthers he was there

2289.119 --> 2294.079
to make his point

2292.56 --> 2296.4
like

2294.079 --> 2299.599
the the one point that they refused to

2296.4 --> 2301.119
move on from right that was what he was

2299.599 --> 2303.3590000000004
doing there

2301.119 --> 2306.4
to be fair

2303.359 --> 2309.68
in my opinion he should have chosen to

2306.4 --> 2312.079
just leave as soon as they refused to

2309.68 --> 2314.0
move on he should just literally okay

2312.079 --> 2316.2400000000002
bye click

2314.0 --> 2318.64
that's what he should have done

2316.24 --> 2320.7999999999997
but he was probably feeling okay but i'm

2318.64 --> 2322.4
here now so i want to do something

2320.8 --> 2324.1600000000003
that's probably the reason why i just

2322.4 --> 2327.359
let it happen

2324.16 --> 2330.7999999999997
which is kind of lame yeah john is not

2327.359 --> 2330.7999999999997
that's not admirable

2331.44 --> 2335.52
right

2333.44 --> 2337.68
you should just say like no no you have

2335.52 --> 2339.599
to actually prove this

2337.68 --> 2342.8799999999997
before you can move on like i'm not

2339.599 --> 2344.8
gonna move on before you prove this

2342.88 --> 2346.32
this thing

2344.8 --> 2348.6400000000003
and say no no

2346.32 --> 2351.3590000000004
i'm sorry then i'm afraid we can't

2348.64 --> 2354.3199999999997
continue okay bye click

2351.359 --> 2357.2
that's how you should do that

2354.32 --> 2357.2000000000003
in my opinion

2365.92 --> 2369.92
who shows was this nathan's nope

2370.8 --> 2373.52
mctoons

2381.359 --> 2387.16
link is in the chat

2383.76 --> 2387.1600000000003
video link

2414.96 --> 2421.44
right okay so that happened yeah well

2418.0 --> 2424.4
that's why it wasn't like oh man i can't

2421.44 --> 2427.28
wait to see that like every time i hear

2424.4 --> 2429.92
like a good train flat earth or a flat

2427.28 --> 2431.6800000000003
earth debate panel is like yeah like i

2429.92 --> 2434.2400000000002
went on with an anti-flat earth and i'm

2431.68 --> 2437.04
like uh really

2434.24 --> 2440.0
really you had to do that

2437.04 --> 2442.64
because i know it's gonna be [ __ ]

2440.0 --> 2445.28
like the only fun things that ever come

2442.64 --> 2448.24
out of there is when anti-flat earthers

2445.28 --> 2450.48
by happenstance just say something

2448.24 --> 2452.0
ridiculous that's to a whole new level

2450.48 --> 2453.839
or something right but that only happens

2452.0 --> 2456.4
by accident it's not worth going on

2453.839 --> 2458.16
there they still are gonna do that

2456.4 --> 2460.8
anyway among themselves like why would

2458.16 --> 2462.72
you even go on there it's just

2460.8 --> 2465.96
i'm not doing that

2462.72 --> 2465.9599999999996
no way

2466.64 --> 2469.7599999999998
a

2467.44 --> 2469.76
john

2478.839 --> 2483.599
925 don't challenge design with the

2481.68 --> 2485.04
rules right

2483.599 --> 2488.0
yeah i bet it is

2485.04 --> 2491.7599999999998
of course and i mean of course the rules

2488.0 --> 2494.72
of his challenge would have to

2491.76 --> 2496.8
be forced to presuppose right

2494.72 --> 2498.64
that's how it's going to work what else

2496.8 --> 2500.96
would you do

2498.64 --> 2502.8799999999997
i'm going to have to presuppose it's

2500.96 --> 2506.0
like the challenge is within the

2502.88 --> 2507.44
presupposition what else could it be

2506.0 --> 2511.2
of course they're going to do that

2507.44 --> 2512.0
they're not going to leave any room

2511.2 --> 2515.04
to

2512.0 --> 2518.64
point out how that is basically all

2515.04 --> 2520.0
false because it is presupposed

2518.64 --> 2522.48
i mean i don't even know what that

2520.0 --> 2524.56
freaking challenge is to know that they

2522.48 --> 2526.96
are going to do that because they always

2524.56 --> 2529.2
have to do that and that's not

2526.96 --> 2531.04
just general blah blah blah no they

2529.2 --> 2533.1189999999997
really always have to do that it's the

2531.04 --> 2535.52
only thing left they can do

2533.119 --> 2537.119
because they were lost they actually

2535.52 --> 2538.56
lost the debate

2537.119 --> 2540.2400000000002
so they can only

2538.56 --> 2543.2
keep debating within their

2540.24 --> 2543.2
presuppositions

2544.079 --> 2547.44
conflict between jim hua and sean

2546.16 --> 2549.44
hawkins

2547.44 --> 2552.2400000000002
uh i did watch

2549.44 --> 2555.04
jim bob's yesterday

2552.24 --> 2556.9599999999996
that's where i came up with my title

2555.04 --> 2558.48
pen sword apple

2556.96 --> 2561.04
but

2558.48 --> 2563.28
no i did hear him talk about sean

2561.04 --> 2565.599
hawkins but what did sean hawkins

2563.28 --> 2567.599
actually get on his show

2565.599 --> 2569.92
earlier i i dismissed that part if that

2567.599 --> 2571.04
happened

2569.92 --> 2572.48
but

2571.04 --> 2574.24
yeah i'm kind of

2572.48 --> 2576.72
i'm kind of happy

2574.24 --> 2578.4799999999996
in a way because sean's a real bastard

2576.72 --> 2580.7999999999997
he's a nag

2578.48 --> 2583.28
and he's annoying he's just annoying

2580.8 --> 2585.28
because he's so [ __ ] [ __ ] so if

2583.28 --> 2588.7200000000003
he's now after jim bob that means he's

2585.28 --> 2588.7200000000003
at least gonna leave me alone

2589.44 --> 2593.7200000000003
and i think that jim bob can pretty much

2591.599 --> 2596.2400000000002
handle him

2593.72 --> 2598.48
[Music]

2596.24 --> 2601.1189999999997
just in chat okay

2598.48 --> 2601.119
or goody

2602.8 --> 2606.92
he's the worst yeah i know

2638.8 --> 2644.0
oh really jarvis lizard people and

2641.04 --> 2644.0
aliens ooh

2644.96 --> 2647.96
right

2657.2 --> 2662.24
can i tell you something about that

2659.2 --> 2663.2
about the the mindset of people that

2662.24 --> 2664.9599999999996
that are

2663.2 --> 2667.2
like obsessed with lizard people and

2664.96 --> 2669.76
aliens you know what it is

2667.2 --> 2672.72
it's them projecting their inner lizard

2669.76 --> 2674.0
people or alien

2672.72 --> 2676.7999999999997
onto

2674.0 --> 2677.92
a phantom opponent

2676.8 --> 2680.079
yeah

2677.92 --> 2682.64
it's how it works

2680.079 --> 2685.119
if somebody is obsessed with something

2682.64 --> 2687.7599999999998
negatively that is usually means that

2685.119 --> 2690.76
they have issues with it

2687.76 --> 2690.76
right

2691.119 --> 2696.96
that something about that thing

2695.119 --> 2698.4
draws them

2696.96 --> 2700.319
right

2698.4 --> 2702.319
so when they constantly talk about it

2700.319 --> 2705.04
like even if they consider it as an

2702.319 --> 2709.119
opponent or an enemy

2705.04 --> 2709.119
it draws it it draws them

2709.599 --> 2712.96
so just

2710.8 --> 2714.5600000000004
look at the people that are obsessed

2712.96 --> 2717.2
with lizard people and look at the

2714.56 --> 2719.52
people that are obsessed with aliens

2717.2 --> 2723.52
there might be a few

2719.52 --> 2726.88
traits that are gonna stand out a little

2723.52 --> 2726.88
if you know what i mean

2727.44 --> 2733.92
pay attention to this

2730.48 --> 2736.64
you know i in in a practical way like

2733.92 --> 2738.88
with really rudimentary psychological

2736.64 --> 2742.24
approach

2738.88 --> 2745.6800000000003
just basics no no field

2742.24 --> 2746.7999999999997
it's just like a rule of fist for me

2745.68 --> 2749.04
that

2746.8 --> 2751.04
whatever people are gonna like bring to

2749.04 --> 2753.92
a conversation

2751.04 --> 2755.599
will directly reflect

2753.92 --> 2758.079
upon like

2755.599 --> 2761.28
a lot of inner traits because people

2758.079 --> 2763.52
will be drawn to things that reflect

2761.28 --> 2766.079
their inner world whether they realize

2763.52 --> 2766.079
it or not

2768.16 --> 2773.359
yeah

2769.92 --> 2776.8
i've been to like alien conventions

2773.359 --> 2778.0
and one thing that really stood out to

2776.8 --> 2780.4
me

2778.0 --> 2783.28
a lot of those people

2780.4 --> 2783.28
like seem

2783.359 --> 2788.7999999999997
like even physically a bit like aliens

2787.28 --> 2791.4500000000003
it's just

2788.8 --> 2794.48
so weird how that works

2791.45 --> 2794.48
[Music]

2796.16 --> 2799.7599999999998
right

2797.68 --> 2801.359
and so for example you could say that

2799.76 --> 2802.5600000000004
people that are obsessed with lizard

2801.359 --> 2805.7599999999998
people

2802.56 --> 2807.119
have issues with like

2805.76 --> 2809.76
psychopathy

2807.119 --> 2811.599
and empathy or the lack thereof or that

2809.76 --> 2813.76
it's really punishing

2811.599 --> 2815.76
those are often people that are really

2813.76 --> 2818.079
drawn to lizards why

2815.76 --> 2820.0
because lizards have absolutely no

2818.079 --> 2821.599
problems

2820.0 --> 2824.56
with those things

2821.599 --> 2824.56
but they are different

2825.2 --> 2831.839
and so a lizard person

2828.0 --> 2831.839
psychologically would be like

2834.24 --> 2841.16
more powerful than them

2837.76 --> 2841.1600000000003
in their minds

2845.64 --> 2849.92
[Music]

2847.839 --> 2853.48
oh god and gadget inspector you had to

2849.92 --> 2853.48
do it didn't you

2859.599 --> 2865.04
i've always seen like this like people

2861.839 --> 2867.2
that are drawn to aliens gray style

2865.04 --> 2869.68
aliens

2867.2 --> 2871.68
have a weird

2869.68 --> 2873.2799999999997
untapped darkness

2871.68 --> 2875.359
with them

2873.28 --> 2879.44
like where they remain

2875.359 --> 2879.44
innocent towards it usually

2880.64 --> 2883.7599999999998
but

2881.44 --> 2886.48
it's like the darkness is capturing

2883.76 --> 2888.079
their inner child it's really weird how

2886.48 --> 2889.68
that works but that's what i noticed

2888.079 --> 2892.88
with people that are really obsessed

2889.68 --> 2896.3999999999996
with aliens it at least back in the day

2892.88 --> 2899.04
like 20 10 years ago now i don't rarely

2896.4 --> 2900.559
see anybody that's like into it's a grey

2899.04 --> 2901.359
aliens and [ __ ]

2900.559 --> 2902.96
right

2901.359 --> 2905.2
but that's what really stood out to me

2902.96 --> 2905.2
then

2906.8 --> 2911.119
like always it's like as soon as

2909.2 --> 2915.7599999999998
somebody brings up aliens just me

2911.119 --> 2918.079
immediately looking at their eyes like

2915.76 --> 2918.079
hmm

2924.72 --> 2926.8799999999997
it's like oh

2926.079 --> 2928.88
so

2926.88 --> 2933.119
you involve in aliens oh they're coming

2928.88 --> 2933.119
after you or are you going after them

2933.839 --> 2941.64
like so there's this weird darkness

2936.559 --> 2941.6400000000003
connection through the dream realm then

2949.92 --> 2954.079
all right it's like it's gonna be sound

2952.48 --> 2957.52
weird but

2954.079 --> 2960.319
i always try to try to figure out like

2957.52 --> 2962.88
the personal emotional relationship that

2960.319 --> 2964.4
people create in reflection to aliens

2962.88 --> 2966.88
when they're into them

2964.4 --> 2970.2400000000002
are they afraid of them

2966.88 --> 2972.559
or are they for example in love fear

2970.24 --> 2974.5589999999997
with them

2972.559 --> 2976.6400000000003
right

2974.559 --> 2979.8390000000004
it's like this weird

2976.64 --> 2982.839
love but also fear kind of obsession

2979.839 --> 2982.839
thing

2990.4 --> 2996.64
they start calling me names of course

2994.079 --> 2998.7200000000003
of course they do

2996.64 --> 2999.7599999999998
i mean i wasn't even there of course

2998.72 --> 3002.319
they start

2999.76 --> 3005.44
ridiculing me

3002.319 --> 3005.44
in another stream

3007.599 --> 3010.92
this is

3012.88 --> 3017.839
just goes to yeah just doesn't it just

3015.359 --> 3020.16
goes to show

3017.839 --> 3020.16
that

3020.319 --> 3027.4
they are not happy with me

3022.96 --> 3027.4
like why else would they keep doing that

3038.559 --> 3042.96
it's but it is it is kind of funny

3041.04 --> 3044.88
because every time

3042.96 --> 3047.28
i pop up somewhere

3044.88 --> 3049.2000000000003
like for example at jimbobs

3047.28 --> 3051.119
and i get on the stream

3049.2 --> 3053.7599999999998
like every time i do that and i have

3051.119 --> 3055.839
just like peaceful good interactions

3053.76 --> 3057.5200000000004
that are where i'm enthusiastic and can

3055.839 --> 3059.599
just be myself and

3057.52 --> 3060.88
be a little funny or whatever

3059.599 --> 3062.0
fluid

3060.88 --> 3064.4
it's like

3062.0 --> 3066.319
these anti-flat earther trolls they just

3064.4 --> 3069.76
go insane

3066.319 --> 3072.88
they hate it so much

3069.76 --> 3075.3590000000004
like really really despise it when that

3072.88 --> 3077.52
happens they're just they get so angry

3075.359 --> 3080.48
all of a sudden like how dare you

3077.52 --> 3082.88
actually get out there and have peaceful

3080.48 --> 3086.96
happy interactions with people are in

3082.88 --> 3086.96
how freaking dare you do that

3088.559 --> 3095.2000000000003
yeah which makes me think like

3091.92 --> 3098.16
maybe i should just do that a lot more

3095.2 --> 3100.24
maybe i should just like go around the

3098.16 --> 3103.5989999999997
shows that i like

3100.24 --> 3105.68
and really try to get on there more

3103.599 --> 3107.92
i'm doing it with jim bob and i yeah i

3105.68 --> 3110.5589999999997
really appreciate being on there so i'm

3107.92 --> 3111.599
gonna keep doing that especially if it's

3110.559 --> 3114.079
going to

3111.599 --> 3116.319
have that kind of an influence

3114.079 --> 3119.3590000000004
because i'm getting a lot of like cross

3116.319 --> 3121.119
contact with like bears from benjamin

3119.359 --> 3122.96
followers and all that and i appreciate

3121.119 --> 3125.839
that because i am a big fan of own

3122.96 --> 3125.839
benjamin and

3125.92 --> 3127.76
like

3126.88 --> 3130.559
on

3127.76 --> 3135.079
his stream or anything

3130.559 --> 3135.079
it's good to have some indirect contact

3145.44 --> 3153.319
belief in aliens was a thing

3149.76 --> 3153.3190000000004
now its conspiracies

3154.72 --> 3157.68
doesn't mean anything

3158.48 --> 3163.68
literally conspiracies that word the way

3161.44 --> 3165.839
it's used it doesn't mean anything all

3163.68 --> 3168.0
when somebody com complains about how

3165.839 --> 3170.48
something is a conspiracy

3168.0 --> 3173.119
you know what that actually means but

3170.48 --> 3174.96
quite literally it means

3173.119 --> 3177.28
i don't care

3174.96 --> 3178.64
i don't want to learn about it

3177.28 --> 3180.88
shut up

3178.64 --> 3183.2799999999997
stop nagging me with information that i

3180.88 --> 3186.1600000000003
don't want to know about that's what

3183.28 --> 3186.1600000000003
that means

3190.24 --> 3195.1189999999997
yeah it's just open

3192.319 --> 3197.52
willing ignorance normalized

3195.119 --> 3201.28
but still hidden under

3197.52 --> 3203.04
under a false pretense like under

3201.28 --> 3206.6400000000003
under a straw man

3203.04 --> 3209.04
the conspiracy no no it's just you

3206.64 --> 3210.72
don't not wanting to know about it being

3209.04 --> 3212.64
lazy

3210.72 --> 3215.2
being weak

3212.64 --> 3218.64
and like preferring and choosing

3215.2 --> 3218.64
consciously ignorance

3218.88 --> 3224.559
over complicated situations that are

3222.0 --> 3227.359
going to affect you and everybody else

3224.559 --> 3227.3590000000004
that's what that is

3228.48 --> 3232.48
every time somebody complains about

3230.559 --> 3236.2000000000003
something being conspiracies or

3232.48 --> 3236.2
conspiracy theory

3250.0 --> 3254.16
keep slagging me over my hologram theory

3254.319 --> 3258.4
good

3256.16 --> 3260.3999999999996
you know how that that is actually a

3258.4 --> 3262.1600000000003
very good sign gadget inspector that

3260.4 --> 3263.2000000000003
they keep slagging me over my hologram

3262.16 --> 3267.2
theory

3263.2 --> 3269.5989999999997
that is my advertisement you see

3267.2 --> 3270.7999999999997
nobody's talking about it out there

3269.599 --> 3273.2000000000003
except me

3270.8 --> 3276.48
and i do not have that much reach

3273.2 --> 3279.2
so yeah good slag me off about my

3276.48 --> 3282.319
hologram theory go ahead

3279.2 --> 3285.04
i want you to do that and i'm not being

3282.319 --> 3287.599
sarcastic when i say that because nobody

3285.04 --> 3289.44
talks about it where's the freaking flat

3287.599 --> 3291.6800000000003
earthers talking about it

3289.44 --> 3295.44
they're all just oh no i can't say that

3291.68 --> 3298.64
oh oh you mean you're afraid

3295.44 --> 3298.64
to consider it

3298.88 --> 3306.0
you don't want to get bullied

3302.319 --> 3308.4
for a revolutionary new concept a new

3306.0 --> 3312.72
approach of the celestials that is

3308.4 --> 3316.96
extremely likely to be completely true

3312.72 --> 3316.9599999999996
and potentially falsifiable

3317.119 --> 3321.359
on the long run at least i mean it is

3319.68 --> 3322.96
possible

3321.359 --> 3326.88
it's more than you could say for a lot

3322.96 --> 3330.599
of like globe math theories

3326.88 --> 3330.599
right it's just math

3342.64 --> 3346.8799999999997
no your enemy is the key

3346.0 --> 3349.839
no

3346.88 --> 3353.359
not always

3349.839 --> 3355.2799999999997
look there are plans set in motion where

3353.359 --> 3357.5989999999997
where they're compartmentalized there is

3355.28 --> 3360.2400000000002
a machine at work

3357.599 --> 3362.4
where it isn't an individual and the the

3360.24 --> 3364.72
acting parties are often going by

3362.4 --> 3367.2000000000003
playbooks that they are not fully

3364.72 --> 3368.8799999999997
informed by even

3367.2 --> 3371.7599999999998
they're talking about really high level

3368.88 --> 3371.76
conspiracies

3372.559 --> 3378.559
but the people in it don't know what

3375.28 --> 3378.559
they're actually doing

3379.119 --> 3382.7200000000003
and they don't want to know they just

3380.88 --> 3386.6800000000003
want the benefits and then for

3382.72 --> 3386.68
everything else to go away

3391.2 --> 3395.7599999999998
david weiss has a hologram hypothesis no

3393.92 --> 3396.77
he doesn't it's not it's not a

3395.76 --> 3398.0
hypothesis

3396.77 --> 3402.319
[Music]

3398.0 --> 3402.319
jedo but he's talking about it cool

3403.839 --> 3407.599
let me guess

3405.2 --> 3409.52
not mentioning me of course about it the

3407.599 --> 3410.88
guy that's been talking about that for

3409.52 --> 3413.599
seven years

3410.88 --> 3416.2400000000002
huh because why would anybody credit our

3413.599 --> 3418.799
win for something that he's consistently

3416.24 --> 3421.5989999999997
and persistently been talking about in

3418.799 --> 3425.28
the field with like everybody he could

3421.599 --> 3427.839
loudly in chat and on live streams

3425.28 --> 3429.52
when everybody was ridiculing him like

3427.839 --> 3433.119
why

3429.52 --> 3436.079
would you credit me if you're suddenly

3433.119 --> 3437.6800000000003
going to talk about that theory you know

3436.079 --> 3439.76
why

3437.68 --> 3442.5589999999997
oh no it's raining

3439.76 --> 3445.559
that's unexpected

3442.559 --> 3445.559
huh

3448.64 --> 3451.7599999999998
nice i guess

3451.92 --> 3455.799
it's gotta be moist though

3469.28 --> 3474.6400000000003
right so yeah jodo if he has a hologram

3472.799 --> 3477.28
hypothesis that's cool it's not a

3474.64 --> 3479.7599999999998
hypothesis though it's just a concept or

3477.28 --> 3482.2400000000002
a model you can call it a model

3479.76 --> 3484.7200000000003
it is basically a model hypothesis

3482.24 --> 3488.0789999999997
requires actual

3484.72 --> 3490.24
establishment of the yeah an interaction

3488.079 --> 3492.48
with a phenomenon in order to establish

3490.24 --> 3494.4799999999996
the cause of an effect

3492.48 --> 3496.64
yeah that's not gonna work with the

3494.48 --> 3498.72
celestial holograms you can't very

3496.64 --> 3502.64
manipulate anything about it but you can

3498.72 --> 3503.52
establish like a lot of what is data

3502.64 --> 3508.48
like

3503.52 --> 3508.48
and what is not like a location is not

3513.44 --> 3517.359
a normal physical object yeah you know

3515.52 --> 3519.52
it isn't an object it's not a physical

3517.359 --> 3521.68
object

3519.52 --> 3524.96
prescribing is holographic is reasonable

3521.68 --> 3526.23
indeed and it is on also the only viable

3524.96 --> 3528.64
option left

3526.23 --> 3530.079
[Music]

3528.64 --> 3532.48
like what the hell else are you going to

3530.079 --> 3532.48
call it

3533.28 --> 3537.6800000000003
can your

3534.24 --> 3539.7599999999998
report or copyright and i don't know

3537.68 --> 3543.2
probably not and why would i do that i

3539.76 --> 3546.6400000000003
just want some [ __ ] credit i want

3543.2 --> 3549.359
credit for the ideas that i've brought

3546.64 --> 3549.359
that's all

3549.44 --> 3554.64
like i don't even want money for it i

3551.68 --> 3556.16
just want a mention

3554.64 --> 3560.5589999999997
a mention

3556.16 --> 3564.24
like hey this idea interesting right

3560.559 --> 3567.44
yeah i got it from a guy

3564.24 --> 3570.839
who's talking about it for seven years

3567.44 --> 3575.28
and maybe sent me an email maybe say hey

3570.839 --> 3577.2799999999997
dude wanna talk about it on my show

3575.28 --> 3580.48
i'll do it i'll come on your show i'll

3577.28 --> 3583.119
be extremely polite i will not be rage

3580.48 --> 3584.96
win of course don't have to worry about

3583.119 --> 3587.599
that

3584.96 --> 3590.2400000000002
don't be a scaredy-cat

3587.599 --> 3592.079
i'll come on your show i'll talk about

3590.24 --> 3595.4399999999996
holographic

3592.079 --> 3598.0
celestials how i see it how i describe

3595.44 --> 3599.92
them and how i came up with them

3598.0 --> 3603.76
how i figured that out at extremely

3599.92 --> 3606.079
young age even though i couldn't yeah

3603.76 --> 3610.079
the information remained dormant inside

3606.079 --> 3613.799
of my mind until it was reconnected

3610.079 --> 3613.799
a few years ago

3621.839 --> 3625.599
we don't know yeah we do know

3625.76 --> 3629.5200000000004
we do know gadget it is in the physical

3628.319 --> 3632.0
object

3629.52 --> 3633.52
all evidence for that is missing

3632.0 --> 3638.559
so to then

3633.52 --> 3638.559
claim it is for any reason is ridiculous

3641.599 --> 3645.92
project blue beam

3643.92 --> 3648.7200000000003
yeah yeah

3645.92 --> 3650.96
fake alien yeah it's cool it's all horse

3648.72 --> 3652.8799999999997
[ __ ]

3650.96 --> 3654.4
they're not doing it

3652.88 --> 3657.44
it's all just

3654.4 --> 3660.559
it has nothing to do with the celestials

3657.44 --> 3662.96
okay the celestials are not created by

3660.559 --> 3664.96
man it's not a device

3662.96 --> 3668.799
government built so that we can have a

3664.96 --> 3671.839
sun and a moon okay

3668.799 --> 3671.839
let's [ __ ] it

3675.119 --> 3679.839
blue beam is on deck no they're not

3677.92 --> 3682.559
going to do anything with it

3679.839 --> 3683.68
they're probably only going to use it

3682.559 --> 3686.559
to like

3683.68 --> 3688.8799999999997
make really cheap

3686.559 --> 3690.4
rocket launch [ __ ]

3688.88 --> 3692.6400000000003
that's probably what they're gonna use

3690.4 --> 3695.2000000000003
it i've already seen them use it like

3692.64 --> 3697.7599999999998
they've already made holograms

3695.2 --> 3699.4399999999996
of spaceships and and all that

3697.76 --> 3702.0
that's what they're using it for they're

3699.44 --> 3704.079
not gonna be an alien invasion and even

3702.0 --> 3707.44
if their words not gonna do anything

3704.079 --> 3709.8390000000004
it's not gonna do anything

3707.44 --> 3711.68
it's a hologram what are you gonna do

3709.839 --> 3714.16
nothing

3711.68 --> 3714.16
nothing

3714.4 --> 3719.119
it if if

3716.0 --> 3722.559
project bluebeam would be executed it

3719.119 --> 3726.96
only would work if you actually have an

3722.559 --> 3729.52
entire military invasion force for it to

3726.96 --> 3732.799
be the cover of otherwise it makes no

3729.52 --> 3734.96
sense why the hell would you even do it

3732.799 --> 3738.28
there's no point

3734.96 --> 3738.28
no point

3741.68 --> 3746.3999999999996
they went with tiny invisible alien

3744.559 --> 3747.44
invaders

3746.4 --> 3750.64
right

3747.44 --> 3753.839
well you know that that viruses are also

3750.64 --> 3757.7599999999998
on the sci-fi agenda that's why almost

3753.839 --> 3759.7599999999998
every space sci-fi movie or series or at

3757.76 --> 3764.4
least the series like always have a

3759.76 --> 3764.4
freaking virus in them somewhere always

3764.559 --> 3769.76
like any series that's like more than 10

3767.28 --> 3774.559
episodes that is science fiction in

3769.76 --> 3775.6800000000003
space it always has a virus

3774.559 --> 3778.2400000000002
always

3775.68 --> 3780.64
always one time at least or sometimes

3778.24 --> 3782.9599999999996
the entire series is about it right

3780.64 --> 3786.8799999999997
every single time

3782.96 --> 3789.839
because it's a sci-fi concept

3786.88 --> 3789.839
it's a concept

3793.44 --> 3800.319
born in the age of futurism like in that

3797.2 --> 3801.2
brainstorming age of futurism that's

3800.319 --> 3803.839
where

3801.2 --> 3806.0
viruses ideas were born based on the

3803.839 --> 3808.48
false premise

3806.0 --> 3811.2
of germ theory

3808.48 --> 3812.88
and then they reified it right like

3811.2 --> 3814.96
nukes

3812.88 --> 3817.839
also born

3814.96 --> 3820.2400000000002
in a think tank era of futurism

3817.839 --> 3822.64
all these crazy things that are all fake

3820.24 --> 3824.9599999999996
were all thought up in the age of

3822.64 --> 3827.2
futurism when the people were coming

3824.96 --> 3829.359
together and doing that thinking about

3827.2 --> 3831.1189999999997
it writing it down

3829.359 --> 3834.0789999999997
and then freaking robber barons with

3831.119 --> 3836.0
their insane amounts of money just like

3834.079 --> 3839.52
let's make this real

3836.0 --> 3842.0
and that's how we got here

3839.52 --> 3844.24
exactly how we got here

3842.0 --> 3847.119
media reification

3844.24 --> 3850.3999999999996
oh look at this new television or radio

3847.119 --> 3852.48
show war of the worlds yes

3850.4 --> 3856.2400000000002
and then

3852.48 --> 3857.599
oh oh yeah medical system

3856.24 --> 3860.3999999999996
oh yeah we're gonna have a new

3857.599 --> 3861.2000000000003
standardized allopathic medical system

3860.4 --> 3864.88
now

3861.2 --> 3870.24
right oh oh yes and of course viruses so

3864.88 --> 3870.2400000000002
important in vaccine industry oh yes

3871.039 --> 3877.0
all based on futurism think tanking

3880.0 --> 3885.119
that's right pgcnet star trek was pretty

3882.319 --> 3886.4
much the the first

3885.119 --> 3889.52
it was like

3886.4 --> 3892.0
one of the initiators to to roll in the

3889.52 --> 3894.64
concept of viruses it was like a new

3892.0 --> 3897.039
thing it was like scary nobody knew

3894.64 --> 3899.0389999999998
anything about it people didn't know it

3897.039 --> 3902.96
was fake okay

3899.039 --> 3906.2400000000002
so it's like what firing what is a virus

3902.96 --> 3907.28
not thinking about it that oh

3906.24 --> 3909.5989999999997
well

3907.28 --> 3911.6800000000003
if viruses would have been real then it

3909.599 --> 3914.799
would have always been here and then the

3911.68 --> 3918.0
entire model that sketched out what

3914.799 --> 3920.0
viruses how it works makes no sense then

3918.0 --> 3923.2
so it can't be real but they weren't

3920.0 --> 3926.4
smart enough to figure that out yet

3923.2 --> 3926.3999999999996
at least most of them

3931.68 --> 3936.2799999999997
yeah dominoid i know

3936.88 --> 3941.119
lockdowns

3938.72 --> 3944.0
yeah the quarantine the whole thing like

3941.119 --> 3945.2000000000003
viral quarantine is it that's

3944.0 --> 3947.599
not new

3945.2 --> 3949.2799999999997
by the way

3947.599 --> 3952.319
serious like

3949.28 --> 3954.4
viruses and lockdown quarantine have

3952.319 --> 3956.64
always been intricately linked it was

3954.4 --> 3958.799
always the fictional part that was

3956.64 --> 3962.16
necessary

3958.799 --> 3964.72
for the concept of viruses

3962.16 --> 3969.0
every time always

3964.72 --> 3969.0
quarantining remember

3992.24 --> 3998.4799999999996
star trek is a [ __ ] program for loonies

3995.6 --> 3999.92
[Music]

3998.48 --> 4002.079
it's like

3999.92 --> 4004.4
it's

4002.079 --> 4007.6800000000003
weird to say but star trek like

4004.4 --> 4010.559
especially the origin it's like

4007.68 --> 4012.799
it's for like luciferian nerds

4010.559 --> 4014.799
not satanic but like luciferian it's

4012.799 --> 4017.7599999999998
just like oh we're gonna be the masters

4014.799 --> 4019.119
of this fictional thing

4017.76 --> 4020.559
it's like

4019.119 --> 4022.96
nerd larp

4020.559 --> 4026.2400000000002
and look look at what what's out there

4022.96 --> 4028.2400000000002
look at the larp scene sci-fi larp it's

4026.24 --> 4030.8799999999997
actually kind of

4028.24 --> 4033.2
halfway entertaining sometimes i don't

4030.88 --> 4035.839
know i

4033.2 --> 4038.0
i thought it looked kind of interesting

4035.839 --> 4040.319
cyberpunks type [ __ ]

4038.0 --> 4040.319
i mean

4040.4 --> 4045.92
but yeah sci-fi was always just like

4043.599 --> 4047.119
sci-fi is just

4045.92 --> 4049.52
fantasy

4047.119 --> 4052.4
it's futurist fantasy right we got like

4049.52 --> 4055.2
the lord of the ring fantasy

4052.4 --> 4058.319
which has kind of become a staple

4055.2 --> 4061.68
a standardized blueprint for engagement

4058.319 --> 4067.2799999999997
in a lot of ways for for fantasy the the

4061.68 --> 4069.52
field the style of fantasy well sci-fi

4067.28 --> 4072.799
is the same thing it's a fictional

4069.52 --> 4074.839
standardized medium situation

4072.799 --> 4078.4
for the

4074.839 --> 4081.44
future spaceships lasers teleport blah

4078.4 --> 4083.28
blah blah super engine and technobabble

4081.44 --> 4086.0
right

4083.28 --> 4088.559
well the fantasy setting

4086.0 --> 4093.599
is the mysterious past

4088.559 --> 4095.599
and magic and magical creatures and

4093.599 --> 4098.799
strange religions and

4095.599 --> 4099.679
maybe ancient beings right

4098.799 --> 4101.44
that's

4099.679 --> 4104.2390000000005
the other side

4101.44 --> 4105.759
that's the past so you have futurism and

4104.239 --> 4108.3189999999995
you have fantasy

4105.759 --> 4110.46
style which is like the past

4108.319 --> 4113.64
past and future

4110.46 --> 4113.64

i hope like the panic situation has

4130.159 --> 4133.839

oh yeah good luck with that

4199.92 --> 4202.4
no

4200.96 --> 4204.4
no that's still

4202.4 --> 4205.839999999999
derpcon three

4204.4 --> 4209.92
but it doesn't matter because bobby

4205.84 --> 4209.92
steele is just hanging there and just

4210.0 --> 4216.36
he's just that he's like our local

4212.159 --> 4216.36
baller hobo or something

4217.92 --> 4222.88
like a gay prostitute

4220.0 --> 4225.04
in case somebody's gonna squirt

4222.88 --> 4227.52
just hanging in the background

4225.04 --> 4229.84
so just let him

4227.52 --> 4232.159000000001
he's he's pretty harmless these days

4229.84 --> 4232.159000000001
good

4232.4 --> 4238.159
because i'm all that ready to just kick

4234.88 --> 4242.84
him out again if he's going to squirt

4238.159 --> 4242.839999999999
hey slow mo moon buggy good to see you

4245.52 --> 4250.159000000001
did you ever find out why spock had

4247.44 --> 4252.32
pointy ears yeah duh

4250.159 --> 4253.839999999999
he was the sci-fi

4252.32 --> 4256.0
elf

4253.84 --> 4258.96
have you not noticed

4256.0 --> 4261.0
that there is a distinct

4258.96 --> 4262.88
like

4261.0 --> 4267.199
hybridization

4262.88 --> 4270.0
of like fantasy races in star trek it as

4267.199 --> 4273.04
a futurism concept and that it kind of

4270.0 --> 4274.719
became like a new thing right

4273.04 --> 4277.12
you have races

4274.719 --> 4279.44
and they put elves in there it's

4277.12 --> 4281.76
probably an original tribute to tolkien

4279.44 --> 4284.48
i'm not even kidding but there is a

4281.76 --> 4287.6
thing about elves it's also religious

4284.48 --> 4289.919999999999
related so yeah pointy ears elves

4287.6 --> 4292.400000000001
spock spock was

4289.92 --> 4292.4
an elf

4293.679 --> 4298.1990000000005
a space elf called the vulcan

4307.36 --> 4314.4
a logic antennas yeah not really though

4312.08 --> 4316.96
it's more like sensory enhanced sensory

4314.4 --> 4316.96
dominoid

4318.4 --> 4322.879999999999
yeah okay in that case but the whole

4320.64 --> 4324.8
logic the whole point about vulcans is

4322.88 --> 4326.88
that they are actually extremely

4324.8 --> 4328.64
emotional and that they suppress it

4326.88 --> 4332.32
through a discipline

4328.64 --> 4332.320000000001
of extreme logic

4332.96 --> 4335.199
right

4335.44 --> 4341.599999999999
but like vulcans have like a lot of

4339.04 --> 4343.84
emotional power that they just refused

4341.6 --> 4343.84
to show

4344.239 --> 4346.639999999999
anyway

4347.04 --> 4351.04
wow it's still waiting

4350.0 --> 4352.56
well

4351.04 --> 4354.96
plants are going to be happy that's for

4398.96 --> 4402.719
i don't think i've ever seen that one

4401.52 --> 4404.320000000001
is it like a

4402.719 --> 4406.719
a black and white

4404.32 --> 4406.719
movie

4407.52 --> 4411.719
oh wait it's probably not

4416.08 --> 4420.48
had some crazy kid shows in the night

4417.84 --> 4423.360000000001
yeah no [ __ ]

i thought like biker mice from mars is

4437.44 --> 4444.48
like really [ __ ] dumb and lame like

4440.64 --> 4446.56
lame and dumb for like dumb stupid kids

4444.48 --> 4450.759999999999
that are lazy

that's that's just mean

4493.199 --> 4497.839999999999
i mean david ike is a pretty tall guy

4516.48 --> 4520.639999999999
mars attack

4518.4 --> 4523.639999999999
right yeah the comedy movie mars attack

4520.64 --> 4523.64
right

4524.239 --> 4529.678999999999
it was

4525.44 --> 4529.678999999999
but it was like a pretty special movie

4532.8 --> 4537.52
like because when that when i first saw

4535.199 --> 4539.919999999999
that was like

4537.52 --> 4542.080000000001
this is annoying

4539.92 --> 4544.56
but then like much later watching it

4542.08 --> 4546.159
back it's like wow this is like really a

4544.56 --> 4547.92
parody

4546.159 --> 4550.96
and i kind of appreciate it more

4547.92 --> 4555.32
afterward than when it first came out

4550.96 --> 4555.32
mars attack crazy movie

4579.04 --> 4583.28
sorry i just

4581.12 --> 4586.5599999999995
communicated some secret message to my

4583.28 --> 4586.5599999999995
brothers in on mars

4588.64 --> 4593.719
well this heat is not good for my man

4590.719 --> 4593.719
disguise

4611.679 --> 4614.8
you wonder how they came up with that

4613.52 --> 4618.64
idea

4614.8 --> 4620.84
it's very simple they were out of ideas

4618.64 --> 4623.52
they were probably

4620.84 --> 4626.96
drunks and then

4623.52 --> 4630.64
just like playing stupid games on like

4626.96 --> 4632.08
sega or something and they were like

4630.64 --> 4634.0
mice

4632.08 --> 4636.88
they're bikers

4634.0 --> 4638.48
it's a mars

4636.88 --> 4640.2390000000005
that's how they came up with it like

4638.48 --> 4642.159
[ __ ] retards and then somebody

4640.239 --> 4644.879999999999
greenlighted it because they had just

4642.159 --> 4646.4
nothing better to do

4644.88 --> 4648.719
really

4646.4 --> 4651.199
i think it was probably like a corporate

4648.719 --> 4653.92
decision

4651.199 --> 4656.08
maybe like the guys that were originally

4653.92 --> 4658.08
coming up with that like did it as a

4656.08 --> 4660.64
joke

4658.08 --> 4661.92
and then unexpectedly management was so

4660.64 --> 4663.679
desperate that they actually

4661.92 --> 4665.1990000000005
greenlighted it

4663.679 --> 4667.679
i don't know

4665.199 --> 4670.239
i just think it's a really freaking

4667.679 --> 4673.8
annoying and stupid series

4670.239 --> 4673.799999999999
i hate it

4682.88 --> 4687.32
anyhow enough of that

4693.28 --> 4698.5599999999995
right yeah pg seen it

4695.6 --> 4700.64
look david ike is

4698.56 --> 4702.96
he has issues right

4700.64 --> 4705.52
he's uh he grabbed white

4702.96 --> 4706.96
he's very widely known

4705.52 --> 4710.56
he is

4706.96 --> 4711.679
a bit of a businessman like that

4710.56 --> 4714.320000000001
right

4711.679 --> 4715.92
in a similar way as to like how alex

4714.32 --> 4716.799999999999
jones is

4715.92 --> 4718.8
so

4716.8 --> 4720.8
he has like

4718.8 --> 4721.92
character flaws and issues concerning

4720.8 --> 4724.2390000000005
that

4721.92 --> 4726.159
but he does keep going

4724.239 --> 4729.12
and he has like

4726.159 --> 4732.4
managed to like draw in

4729.12 --> 4735.44
a big crowd using very basic concepts

4732.4 --> 4738.32
that are very consistent

4735.44 --> 4740.96
and so i have to respect that

4738.32 --> 4742.96
like he was a very good early awakener

4740.96 --> 4746.159
for those that wanted to awaken in a

4742.96 --> 4748.4800000000005
relatively early stage

4746.159 --> 4751.679
was pretty good for that

4748.48 --> 4752.5599999999995
and it was like very encouraging for me

4751.679 --> 4755.1990000000005
too

4752.56 --> 4758.0
so i like david ike i mean where he's at

4755.199 --> 4758.0
now is like

4758.32 --> 4761.12
it's

4759.12 --> 4763.84
it's become a little outdated because

4761.12 --> 4766.8
just the psychological war pace has gone

4763.84 --> 4768.400000000001
up and like his style is like it's going

4766.8 --> 4770.64
to run behind

4768.4 --> 4774.159
right because every what's going on

4770.64 --> 4777.56
right now is just like too aggressive

4774.159 --> 4777.5599999999995
for his level

4779.28 --> 4782.4
right but

4780.64 --> 4784.0
it's not like he's gonna perish under

4782.4 --> 4784.799999999999
that

4784.0 --> 4786.4
so

4784.8 --> 4788.64
yeah i like david

4786.4 --> 4790.199
i met him i met him in person actually

4788.64 --> 4791.76
and

4790.199 --> 4794.48
2008

4791.76 --> 4794.4800000000005
was pretty cool

4795.44 --> 4798.799999999999
and he's a pretty tall guy

4800.159 --> 4805.08
but he does not like flat earth though

4809.84 --> 4814.08
i think i actually

4811.92 --> 4817.6
said something about flat earth to him

4814.08 --> 4820.32
in 2008 yeah because i was actually

4817.6 --> 4821.360000000001
awakened to it partially

4820.32 --> 4822.48
right

4821.36 --> 4825.199
but

4822.48 --> 4827.678999999999
no that yeah 2008

4825.199 --> 4830.08
or 2009 somewhere there

4827.679 --> 4833.84
i went to some like convention in the

4830.08 --> 4833.84
netherlands and he was there

4836.56 --> 4840.04
it was epic

4854.639 --> 4860.76
what he has a documentary called

4856.88 --> 4860.76
renegade okay

4871.19 --> 4878.719
[Music]

4874.32 --> 4878.719
it be like i i know no i don't

4881.52 --> 4887.159000000001
know let i be i guy i'd like to be me

4917.199 --> 4922.08
okay steven trail yeah sure

4920.639 --> 4925.84
yeah but he's always about that

4922.08 --> 4928.8
holographic experience i'm not

4925.84 --> 4930.8
i see that as the spiritual realm that's

4928.8 --> 4933.679
parallel

4930.8 --> 4937.28
to the physical realm

4933.679 --> 4942.0
but it has nothing to do with objects or

4937.28 --> 4942.0
alleged object within the realm itself

4942.239 --> 4947.599999999999
it's like another dimension that's just

4944.639 --> 4950.0
parallel and nothing in this physical

4947.6 --> 4952.2390000000005
realm has anything

4950.0 --> 4955.12
any causal relationship with the

4952.239 --> 4955.12
spiritual realm

4956.96 --> 4961.76
other than well your physical body

4960.08 --> 4964.0
for you

4961.76 --> 4966.159000000001
so yeah he had all these crazy ideas

4964.0 --> 4967.92
about the holo moon and the space

4966.159 --> 4970.839999999999
station and yeah it makes absolutely no

4967.92 --> 4972.56
freaking sense and it's just like

4970.84 --> 4974.719
yeah

4972.56 --> 4977.76
i guess he thought he needed to say

4974.719 --> 4979.28
something about it right and he's not a

4977.76 --> 4982.639
flat earther

4979.28 --> 4982.639
so i've been avoiding that

4982.96 --> 4987.2390000000005
ah jesus christ

4990.159 --> 4995.638999999999
it's still raining it's like getting

4992.239 --> 4995.638999999999
really moist

5004.159 --> 5009.04
did even like huge waking up with the

5007.04 --> 5011.28
cove yeah yeah

5009.04 --> 5014.8
yeah but come on who didn't

5011.28 --> 5018.08
everybody was doing that pgcnet

5014.8 --> 5020.08
like seriously everybody was doing that

5018.08 --> 5022.32
even i was doing it

5020.08 --> 5024.32
i was

5022.32 --> 5025.92
it's still there my videos are still

5024.32 --> 5028.159
there there's only one that was taken

5025.92 --> 5029.679
down really but yeah in all those two

5028.159 --> 5031.759999999999
years guys

5029.679 --> 5036.4800000000005
just for the record you can go back two

5031.76 --> 5036.4800000000005
years i was talking about it on my show

5036.639 --> 5040.84
i guess sons yes he does

5058.48 --> 5064.159
channels a demon

5060.639 --> 5064.159000000001
what the hell are you talking about

5064.239 --> 5067.12
i didn't

5069.92 --> 5075.6
david i did not channel a demon

5073.36 --> 5077.839999999999
he went to a shaman

5075.6 --> 5080.320000000001
and he tapped into the dark world he

5077.84 --> 5082.159000000001
probably used ayahuasca

5080.32 --> 5083.679
maybe in a similar way that i had

5082.159 --> 5085.759999999999
experienced

5083.679 --> 5087.12
so every time he talks about that

5085.76 --> 5090.719
experience

5087.12 --> 5092.96
i recognize that experience the way he

5090.719 --> 5094.88
talks it about it the way he describes

5092.96 --> 5096.2390000000005
it even not understanding what he's

5094.88 --> 5098.719
experienced

5096.239 --> 5101.36
i understand what that is

5098.719 --> 5104.08
i've had that

5101.36 --> 5104.08
experience

5104.48 --> 5108.4
he did not channel a demon

5110.159 --> 5114.638999999999
talks about it what are you blabbering

5112.32 --> 5114.639
about

5122.0 --> 5125.0
what

5146.88 --> 5150.88
i mean where the hell are you getting

5148.4 --> 5150.879999999999
this from

5152.719 --> 5156.96
he names the demon so does he actually

5155.199 --> 5159.678999999999
say it's a demon

5156.96 --> 5162.159
does he say that or is it just you

5159.679 --> 5163.76
calling it that

5162.159 --> 5165.04
borders boy

5163.76 --> 5166.719
because you're

5165.04 --> 5170.88
a little bit of a

5166.719 --> 5174.96
christian fanatical religious zealot

5170.88 --> 5177.6
he names yeah so did he name it a demon

5174.96 --> 5180.08
did he say that's a demon i channeled a

5177.6 --> 5185.719
demon did he say that

5180.08 --> 5185.719
or are you calling it a demon

5204.56 --> 5210.04
i think what you're talking about is the

5206.159 --> 5210.04
time he channeled an angel

5210.239 --> 5214.159
that's not a demon

5211.84 --> 5214.159000000001
dick

5214.32 --> 5219.5199999999995
yeah yeah i knew it i know c this is

5216.96 --> 5221.679
borders boy i don't even know why i keep

5219.52 --> 5223.92
him around anymore

5221.679 --> 5225.1990000000005
you're just a religious fanatical

5223.92 --> 5226.8
[ __ ]

5225.199 --> 5229.36
borders boy

5226.8 --> 5232.159000000001
you're just being a dick

5229.36 --> 5232.159
it's annoying

5237.12 --> 5242.96
yeah

5239.76 --> 5246.0
i mean i've had extreme experiences i've

5242.96 --> 5248.8
faced actual demons okay

5246.0 --> 5251.6
you don't know what the [ __ ] a demon is

5248.8 --> 5253.360000000001
borders boy you don't know what that is

5251.6 --> 5254.719
you hear me

5253.36 --> 5256.88
ass

5254.719 --> 5259.199
you don't know what that is

5256.88 --> 5261.84
if somebody has a dark world or like

5259.199 --> 5263.28
hallucinatory experience

5261.84 --> 5266.719
and it's like

5263.28 --> 5269.84
by their description angelic right even

5266.719 --> 5273.04
though it might not compare to the exact

5269.84 --> 5274.8
rules from your priesthood that derived

5273.04 --> 5278.159
it from a bible that was

5274.8 --> 5282.56
written around as a theocracy tool

5278.159 --> 5284.48
to like encapsulate the savior yeah

5282.56 --> 5287.280000000001
yeah oh it doesn't abide by that rules

5284.48 --> 5291.36
well go [ __ ] yourself it was an angel if

5287.28 --> 5294.5599999999995
it was a demon you'd [ __ ] know

5291.36 --> 5296.96
yeah because that's extremely unpleasant

5294.56 --> 5299.92
and it deranges you

5296.96 --> 5302.4
like it takes away your confidence it

5299.92 --> 5304.96
does a lot of terrible [ __ ] and you're

5302.4 --> 5306.96
not gonna do what david ike does

5304.96 --> 5309.92
it doesn't happen when a demon

5306.96 --> 5311.199
approaches you you don't know what a

5309.92 --> 5314.2390000000005
demon is

5311.199 --> 5315.919999999999
i do i [ __ ] face those things yeah in

5314.239 --> 5320.32
the dark world

5315.92 --> 5320.32
yeah what he described is not a demon

5321.36 --> 5324.239
shut up bobby

5323.04 --> 5326.719
[ __ ]

5324.239 --> 5326.718999999999
[ __ ] off

5332.88 --> 5337.28
there really are evil spirit yeah i know

5335.84 --> 5338.159000000001
i faced them

5337.28 --> 5340.08
yeah

5338.159 --> 5342.0
those things

5340.08 --> 5343.92
don't

5342.0 --> 5345.52
work the same way

5343.92 --> 5348.0
as like

5345.52 --> 5350.88
demons did not go out

5348.0 --> 5352.96
and tell people you need to share this

5350.88 --> 5354.639
information you need to you need to help

5352.96 --> 5356.56
people with the awakening yeah that's

5354.639 --> 5360.639
not what demons did

5356.56 --> 5363.04
yeah what demons did was go around

5360.639 --> 5364.639
bind people try to bind people to them

5363.04 --> 5368.159
through their sins

5364.639 --> 5371.12
and then ask them to go against it to

5368.159 --> 5374.638999999999
stifle and destroy the awakening that's

5371.12 --> 5379.239
what demons do yeah david ike did not

5374.639 --> 5379.2390000000005
channel the demon you hear me [ __ ]

5380.239 --> 5384.32
you know it by what happened by what

5383.04 --> 5387.84
he's doing

5384.32 --> 5390.719
why don't you [ __ ] use logic

5387.84 --> 5393.76
instead of your stupid quote [ __ ] that

5390.719 --> 5398.2390000000005
you don't understand obviously

5393.76 --> 5400.29
yeah logic the actions will reveal what

5398.239 --> 5403.419999999999
it is

5400.29 --> 5403.42
[Music]

5405.79 --> 5414.5199999999995
[Music]

5410.719 --> 5414.52
oh lydia logs

5431.44 --> 5436.719
okay so was an alien and he had a

5433.28 --> 5436.719
conversation with an alien

5439.28 --> 5444.239
that's weird

5440.88 --> 5446.08
i think i've well i've seen aliens

5444.239 --> 5449.12
i never really went into conversation

5446.08 --> 5450.88
with them though

5449.12 --> 5454.48
i thought like everything they have to

5450.88 --> 5454.4800000000005
say is pretty much a waste of time

5461.6 --> 5463.84
all right

5464.08 --> 5468.0
it's naomi what

5470.8 --> 5477.08
okay

5472.0 --> 5477.08
so right he was into aliens

5477.76 --> 5482.8
well there's a lot of people back then

5480.159 --> 5482.799999999999
it's weird

5483.36 --> 5488.719
where do aliens come from

5485.44 --> 5492.0
well aliens greys are dark world demons

5488.719 --> 5492.0
but they're like lesser

5493.76 --> 5497.92
just like

5496.32 --> 5500.5599999999995
i don't know they might have originally

5497.92 --> 5502.08
been humans and they're just like off

5500.56 --> 5504.56
spirits

5502.08 --> 5506.8
i don't know

5504.56 --> 5509.360000000001
but they're not like

5506.8 --> 5511.28
like actual serious demons are really

5509.36 --> 5513.599999999999
[ __ ] up like they

5511.28 --> 5513.599999999999
yeah

5514.239 --> 5518.04
so this is all ridiculous

5524.4 --> 5526.5599999999995
just

5527.28 --> 5530.5599999999995
yeah porter's white just

5530.639 --> 5537.36
just stay away for a while okay i'm just

5534.08 --> 5539.84
so sick of you bringing that [ __ ] up

5537.36 --> 5542.4
this is the whining

5539.84 --> 5546.4800000000005
eternal whining yeah

5542.4 --> 5548.0
okay let me declare to you borders boy

5546.48 --> 5550.879999999999
yeah me

5548.0 --> 5553.44
specifically in relation to you yeah i'm

5550.88 --> 5556.159000000001
a demon you hear me

5553.44 --> 5558.32
you can consider me as literally being

5556.159 --> 5561.04
possessed by that which you are

5558.32 --> 5563.36
declaring all those things you hear me

5561.04 --> 5566.08
so [ __ ] off

5563.36 --> 5567.759999999999
with your whining

5566.08 --> 5569.12
i'm sick of it

5567.76 --> 5571.1990000000005
you don't know what the hell you're

5569.12 --> 5575.84
talking about nobody gives a [ __ ] about

5571.199 --> 5575.839999999999
your freaking devil persecution [ __ ]

5578.48 --> 5581.199
sick of it

5583.92 --> 5588.4
why do aliens need to be bad

5586.08 --> 5590.0
bad they're unnatural

5588.4 --> 5592.879999999999
they're like

5590.0 --> 5595.199
unnatural frequency humans they're

5592.88 --> 5596.08
deranged

5595.199 --> 5600.759999999999
they're

5596.08 --> 5600.76
without god within their directives

5604.96 --> 5608.159
now as a

5606.56 --> 5610.56
personality

5608.159 --> 5613.5199999999995
they don't necessarily have to be like

5610.56 --> 5616.080000000001
consumed by the hunger for evil like

5613.52 --> 5618.56
actual full-on demons that don't show

5616.08 --> 5620.719
themselves as aliens

5618.56 --> 5624.0
they usually show themselves as

5620.719 --> 5626.159
nightmarish monsters

5624.0 --> 5628.48
right whatever works best for the

5626.159 --> 5630.638999999999
individuals because a real demon shows

5628.48 --> 5632.638999999999
itself exactly

5630.639 --> 5634.719
according to the nightmares of the

5632.639 --> 5636.0
information assimilated by the

5634.719 --> 5637.679
individual

5636.0 --> 5640.32
they're holographic

5637.679 --> 5642.8
beings in the dark world they can take

5640.32 --> 5644.96
whatever form they want and they want to

5642.8 --> 5647.679
take the form of your nightmares that's

5644.96 --> 5651.84
what real demons do

5647.679 --> 5652.8
aliens are weird and slightly different

5651.84 --> 5654.719
they're like

5652.8 --> 5656.4800000000005
gay little brothers of the demons or

5654.719 --> 5659.52
something i don't know

5656.48 --> 5662.08
but they are bad they are not good news

5659.52 --> 5665.92
they never lead to anything

5662.08 --> 5667.6
that is divine that is with god

5665.92 --> 5669.6
so they're like this they're like the

5667.6 --> 5673.1990000000005
dark world spirit

5669.6 --> 5675.360000000001
atheist spirits or something it's weird

5673.199 --> 5677.36
aliens are weird

5675.36 --> 5680.719
are alien soulless

5677.36 --> 5680.719
what the hell does that even mean

5682.4 --> 5688.719
i mean they're not they're not living

5684.719 --> 5690.96
beings they're not alive with bodies if

5688.719 --> 5693.04
that's what you're asking

5690.96 --> 5696.4
is that the requirement do you have to

5693.04 --> 5699.28
have a body in order to have a soul

5696.4 --> 5701.119
like i don't know

5699.28 --> 5703.599999999999
i don't think

5701.119 --> 5703.599999999999
i don't know

5710.0 --> 5713.199
oh price of adam

5713.679 --> 5716.2390000000005
what the

5716.56 --> 5722.2390000000005
i'm not a demon i'm hellbound that

5719.52 --> 5723.92
that doesn't sound very pleasant

5722.239 --> 5725.678999999999
i hope i'm not

5723.92 --> 5727.4400000000005
although i am gonna go through hell

5725.679 --> 5729.28
while i'm still alive i'm pretty sure

5727.44 --> 5731.759999999999
about that

5729.28 --> 5734.5599999999995
i mean the eternal war is the only thing

5731.76 --> 5736.88
left for me to do

5734.56 --> 5738.88
i've seen way too much pretty much to

5736.88 --> 5741.679
even care about other things at this

5738.88 --> 5743.04
point as this point

5741.679 --> 5744.4800000000005
i'm

5743.04 --> 5746.639
i'm just

5744.48 --> 5748.879999999999
kind of obsessed of just destroying the

5746.639 --> 5750.4800000000005
demons here i just

5748.88 --> 5753.679
that's what i want

5750.48 --> 5755.5199999999995
it i want it more than life

5753.679 --> 5756.88
and that's kind of stupid

5755.52 --> 5759.679
really i know

5756.88 --> 5759.679
i just like

5761.199 --> 5765.839999999999
i'm sorry

5763.04 --> 5768.84
i just want the demons out i want them

5765.84 --> 5768.84
out

5770.08 --> 5775.119
and like even if i try to do something

5772.56 --> 5776.96
else i'll just get pissed off on a daily

5775.119 --> 5779.759999999999
basis about it and it's not going to

5776.96 --> 5782.4
stop so either can just

5779.76 --> 5784.400000000001
sit with that need and that longing and

5782.4 --> 5787.759999999999
the rage that comes from it the rest of

5784.4 --> 5789.759999999999
my life or i could actually use my mind

5787.76 --> 5793.04
to figure out to actually how to

5789.76 --> 5793.04
actually accomplish it

5795.36 --> 5799.839999999999
right but i'm gonna round out this weird

5797.119 --> 5799.839999999999
ass show

5802.639 --> 5806.96
all over the place

5804.239 --> 5808.959999999999
just like just freaking leave david like

5806.96 --> 5813.199
alone man

5808.96 --> 5817.04
i mean he's he aims at a white public

5813.199 --> 5820.48
he is a new ager like he really is a new

5817.04 --> 5822.239
ager he doesn't channel demons he's not

5820.48 --> 5824.718999999999
evil

5822.239 --> 5827.5199999999995
he's not trying

5824.719 --> 5829.04
to be evil and hiding it

5827.52 --> 5832.88
but he is like

5829.04 --> 5836.239
wide aim so it's going to be [ __ ]

5832.88 --> 5838.719
and other like weird

5836.239 --> 5841.199
hippy-dippy stuff a bit

5838.719 --> 5844.0
that's just it that's just what he does

5841.199 --> 5846.638999999999
it's not evil leave him alone

5844.0 --> 5846.639
wankers

5848.08 --> 5852.5599999999995
try to concentrate on it i do that all

5850.08 --> 5855.679
the time dude i call upon angels on a

5852.56 --> 5858.639
daily basis lydia logs that really

5855.679 --> 5860.08
demons don't do anything

5858.639 --> 5863.76
to me

5860.08 --> 5863.76
i've had my time with them

5864.32 --> 5870.0
but yeah if you're if you truly get rid

5867.36 --> 5871.759999999999

the demonically possessed

5886.719 --> 5889.84
