right anyway I did have a title for

275.039 --> 282.52
today's show was just like a

278.36 --> 284.68
phrase It's kind of General I it did not

282.52 --> 287.84
apply to something

284.68 --> 290.72
specific it's just a general phrase We

287.84 --> 296.08
combined to form a new giant

290.72 --> 301.56
Chanel oh god well good luck with that

296.08 --> 301.56
Tunes somebody else that did that before

301.96 --> 307.28
did not work out for him but uh yeah

305.12 --> 310.08
best of luck I don't see why you even

307.28 --> 310.08
needed that

310.56 --> 316.52
really but hey I mean in the end I

313.32 --> 318.96
expect all of you anti flat earthers the

316.52 --> 321.88
typical guys to all form up and like

318.96 --> 325.71999999999997
form the anti Flat Earth

321.88 --> 328.479
debates like what you technically are I

325.72 --> 333.56
mean if you put all of you guys together

328.479 --> 335.88
then you sort of have like a a debate

333.56 --> 338.28000000000003
team it's going to be nowhere it's going

335.88 --> 340.36
to be a giant mess every time but I mean

338.28 --> 343.08
it will kind of feel like it's almost

340.36 --> 343.08000000000004
like Flat Earth

343.44 --> 349.12
debates anyway hey hello Richard G good

346.8 --> 349.12
to see

358.479 --> 361.479
you

364.53 --> 367.65
[Music]

372.88 --> 379.919
he's installing the anti-gravity

376.52 --> 379.919
boots what's

380.74 --> 386.759
[Music]

384.16 --> 388.40000000000003
gravity then we shall fly oh really how

386.759 --> 391.40000000000003
do you do

388.4 --> 391.4
that

394.24 --> 400.28000000000003
how is your anti-gravity going to do

396.52 --> 400.28
that when gravity isn't a

404.47 --> 409.72
[Music]

418.4 --> 421.4
force

423.24 --> 429.0
then we shall

424.8 --> 434.039
fly I don't know Tunes it's more

429.0 --> 436.36
like I think it's not so much fly

434.039 --> 439.199
as

436.36 --> 441.08000000000004
uh like a bunch of quailes just coming

439.199 --> 443.8
together and falling into a quail trap

441.08 --> 443.8
it's more like

446.96 --> 450.91999999999996
that I don't think you're really going

449.199 --> 454.54900000000004
to fly

450.92 --> 454.54900000000004
[Music]

457.02 --> 460.15999999999997
[Music]

461.72 --> 467.44000000000005
anywhere oh wow okay well good luck with

465.479 --> 469.639
that I'm sure you

467.44 --> 474.0
can defeat

469.639 --> 477.879
your fictional conjured enemy I'm sure

474.0 --> 482.72
you'll be able to do that one right when

477.879 --> 482.72
the real people are left

487.43 --> 492.28000000000003
[Music]

489.96 --> 495.28
undefeated hey I got a hint for you by

492.28 --> 500.0
the way yeah using

495.28 --> 501.84
phrases like from 60s and 7s comic books

500.0 --> 504.159
it's not very

501.84 --> 507.08
cool

504.159 --> 510.52
yeah I mean some people might see it as

507.08 --> 514.039
like comically nostalgic when in a

510.52 --> 517.039
movie but nobody actually thinks that's

514.039 --> 517.039
cool

517.36 --> 527.109
[Music]

529.72 --> 536.23
okay hey clutch by the way good to see

533.13 --> 536.23
[Music]

538.2 --> 543.2990000000001
you

540.23 --> 543.299
[Music]

547.519 --> 553.079
right but to address the title it's a

550.399 --> 556.36
general formula like if things are going

553.079 --> 557.12
to [ __ ] you can just be mopy about it or

556.36 --> 561.72
you

557.12 --> 563.9590000000001
could try to get over it as quickly as

561.72 --> 567.48
possible and envision what the world's

563.959 --> 571.1199999999999
going to be like and then what can you

567.48 --> 571.12
do with that new

571.92 --> 578.76
form

574.68 --> 580.88
right it's like when things change there

578.76 --> 583.76
are opportunities everywhere and then

580.88 --> 587.64
the grabler come in and they try to take

583.76 --> 590.2
it all over so you got to be

587.64 --> 594.36
there first and just grab the

590.2 --> 594.36
opportunities before they get

596.64 --> 601.12
grab right there's no time for

611.24 --> 614.48
[Music]

616.04 --> 621.079
complaining 9th November day

621.48 --> 626.88
of

624.36 --> 631.04
oh okay yeah I didn't even know that was

626.88 --> 631.04
happening tered I mean

631.839 --> 638.44
I don't pay attention to like political

635.6 --> 638.44
movements like

640.36 --> 648.32
that I'm done with this with these games

644.839 --> 650.7600000000001
and their political Unity it's is all

648.32 --> 650.7600000000001
hor

651.16 --> 656.88
[ __ ] I

652.839 --> 656.8800000000001
mean it's not doing

658.04 --> 661.04
anything

665.32 --> 674.36
hey fibr

666.64 --> 674.36
[Music]

680.72 --> 687.6
outs Indians are supporting Israel

684.6 --> 687.6
really

687.959 --> 696.88
wow but are you sure well yeah but I

693.6 --> 700.5600000000001
mean that might be because

696.88 --> 704.04
well Indians typically wouldn't support

700.56 --> 704.04
Muslims they have their own

704.24 --> 712.0790000000001
hassle long

707.36 --> 714.48
tribal stuff with the Pakistan so I mean

712.079 --> 718.8
in from that perspective it makes

714.48 --> 721.839
sense but I mean any any entanglement at

718.8 --> 725.4399999999999
this this point is just like not

721.839 --> 728.24
good and old free Palestine movement is

725.44 --> 732.639
a giant mess

728.24 --> 735.12
where like support H support H like

732.639 --> 735.9590000000001
hello the people don't even know what

735.12 --> 739.399
they're

735.959 --> 741.88
doing don't even know what's going on

739.399 --> 745.57
nobody should be supporting Hamas

741.88 --> 745.57
[Music]

746.959 --> 754.56
nobody right and Palestine isn't Hamas

751.76 --> 757.8
and and people don't get that and that's

754.56 --> 759.959
a problem it's just that yeah you're all

757.8 --> 764.079
really want to do the right thing you're

759.959 --> 766.3599999999999
just too [ __ ] to realize even when

764.079 --> 769.8389999999999
it's all right in your face what the

766.36 --> 772.9
[ __ ] is going on so you just fall into

769.839 --> 775.0790000000001
these quail traps like a bunch of

772.9 --> 777.72
[Music]

775.079 --> 780.3599999999999
idiots and end up like oh you know I'm

777.72 --> 783.0400000000001
joining with the big group even though

780.36 --> 786.5600000000001
they are like all over the place clearly

783.04 --> 791.04
like supporting Hamas which

786.56 --> 794.4399999999999
is like unmistakably like a terrorist

791.04 --> 796.519
organization not just from Israeli

794.44 --> 798.8000000000001
perspective they're [ __ ] they're

796.519 --> 803.76
completely [ __ ] they've effectively

798.8 --> 803.76
ruined things and they continually do

806.639 --> 812.76
it just think of

809.72 --> 817.48
what how things would have gone if Hamas

812.76 --> 820.079
was not there officially didn't do

817.48 --> 823.32
anything well there would have been

820.079 --> 826.519
probably a few hundred thousand less

823.32 --> 829.8000000000001
Palestinian Castle casualties

826.519 --> 831.92
then right oh but but this what yeah

829.8 --> 833.3599999999999
yeah yeah I'm just being extremely

831.92 --> 835.959
pragmatic

833.36 --> 838.04
here and just looking at like what do

835.959 --> 840.04
they actually do what do they accomplish

838.04 --> 842.5999999999999
except for

840.04 --> 843.88
brutal retaliation and hundreds of

842.6 --> 847.1990000000001
thousands of

843.88 --> 850.0
casualties of civilians which is what

847.199 --> 853.959
seems to happen every time they [ __ ]

850.0 --> 856.079
do something yeah so oh support him

853.959 --> 858.399
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] if you support

856.079 --> 858.399
those

858.6 --> 864.8000000000001
guys all of

861.36 --> 867.72
them I mean yeah rescue these civilians

864.8 --> 869.7589999999999
I I get it the civilians Palestine

867.72 --> 871.24
absolutely and there getting the [ __ ]

869.759 --> 875.5600000000001
they are getting [ __ ] you know they

871.24 --> 878.279
need they need to or I would like to see

875.56 --> 881.16
them protected but if you're just like

878.279 --> 885.8
generally supporting it well guess who

881.16 --> 887.199
who Who's like taking that support Hamas

885.8 --> 890.199
and they're a freaking terrorist

887.199 --> 893.4399999999999
organization that likes to escalate

890.199 --> 895.8389999999999
things and just like make the wounds

893.44 --> 897.6800000000001
deeper that's what they keep doing every

895.839 --> 900.6800000000001
freaking time they do

897.68 --> 900.68
anything

901.519 --> 905.68
so I'm not supporting

918.08 --> 921.33
[Music]

926.759 --> 932.88
anything have to sh no ter you're not

930.12 --> 932.88
you're not really

935.48 --> 943.8000000000001
listening everyone is being manipulated

940.04 --> 946.68
everyone the whole [ __ ] world through

943.8 --> 950.8389999999999
media they don't know what they're doing

946.68 --> 955.68
it's it's the same [ __ ] as like the

950.839 --> 958.3190000000001
WWF world wild fund whatever it's

955.68 --> 959.8389999999999
called nature stuff right and everybody

958.319 --> 962.24
thought oh we're doing the right thing

959.839 --> 964.9200000000001
and literally it was all going to

962.24 --> 968.319
freaking other projects and [ __ ] like

964.92 --> 970.88
it's a gigantic mess that whole [ __ ]

968.319 --> 973.4799999999999
thing and but people just do it all

970.88 --> 974.959
support it and that's what's happening

973.48 --> 977.88
right

974.959 --> 980.8
now what you really think it's all

977.88 --> 984.56
everything you do is going to

980.8 --> 987.079
secure the Palestinians is

984.56 --> 990.399
it

987.079 --> 992.7199999999999
no it's just it's a giant

990.399 --> 995.319
amplifier which

992.72 --> 996.759
Hamas people don't even understand what

995.319 --> 1000.4399999999999
that is

996.759 --> 1002.839
really yeah they're just going to use it

1000.44 --> 1004.6800000000001
to pop some more balloons because that's

1002.839 --> 1008.1990000000001
what they

1004.68 --> 1011.279
do they like to escalate things every

1008.199 --> 1016.399
single time with no constructive purpose

1011.279 --> 1016.399
only more war more pain more

1017.48 --> 1024.4
trauma that's why earlier on like I

1020.279 --> 1025.839
called Hamas like satanists not because

1024.4 --> 1029.24
they are

1025.839 --> 1032.559
Muslim it's because of what they do what

1029.24 --> 1035.919
they end up doing all the

1032.559 --> 1037.16
time escalating making things worse not

1035.919 --> 1040.24
solving

1037.16 --> 1043.919
anything only making it worse every

1040.24 --> 1043.919
[ __ ] time

1047.4 --> 1054.679
so until that is like truly

1052.38 --> 1058.24
[Music]

1054.679 --> 1061.52
addressed until like it's they are

1058.24 --> 1062.28
separated in the minds and hearts of all

1061.52 --> 1066.6399999999999
the

1062.28 --> 1069.6789999999999
people like Hamas separated from

1066.64 --> 1072.48
Palestinians realize what they actually

1069.679 --> 1075.1200000000001
do and they just make everything worse

1072.48 --> 1077.4
for the Palestinians every [ __ ] time

1075.12 --> 1080.3999999999999
they do

1077.4 --> 1080.4
something

1086.67 --> 1092.76
[Music]

1090.08 --> 1094.1999999999998
oh she Dr Shiva saying that too great

1092.76 --> 1096.76
I'm

1094.2 --> 1098.64
glad I haven't really followed Shiva

1096.76 --> 1101.32
around too much in the recent few days

1098.64 --> 1102.48
but I mean he gets it though like I I

1101.32 --> 1106.6399999999999
don't have

1102.48 --> 1108.1200000000001
to hold my breath to to to realize that

1106.64 --> 1111.76
he will get these things right because

1108.12 --> 1115.6399999999999
he's a very smart guy very well

1111.76 --> 1115.64
informed better than I am

1124.99 --> 1128.13
[Music]

1132.88 --> 1140.3200000000002
arguably yeah as always the innocent

1135.039 --> 1140.32
people on all sides get screwed yeah but

1140.679 --> 1147.4
technically it can be

1143.4 --> 1150.64
fixed it can be problem is it really

1147.4 --> 1153.88
won't be cuz nobody really wants to deal

1150.64 --> 1155.96
with it and it's all too much and so

1153.88 --> 1162.72
you're going to go with standard roll

1155.96 --> 1166.159
outs autopilot stuff and that's

1162.72 --> 1169.2
yeah until it's like officially planned

1166.159 --> 1174.72
and strategized from the perspective

1169.2 --> 1177.0800000000002
of you got the Israeli extreme

1174.72 --> 1178.72
government that is like blatantly

1177.08 --> 1180.72
committing war crimes even though they

1178.72 --> 1181.64
don't think of it as such because of

1180.72 --> 1185.1200000000001
their

1181.64 --> 1189.24
ideology and then you got the

1185.12 --> 1191.799
Hamas with their radical

1189.24 --> 1194.64
escalating just

1191.799 --> 1197.32
terrorism pointless terrorism even like

1194.64 --> 1198.72
it's not helping Palestine at all every

1197.32 --> 1200.24
time they do something it makes

1198.72 --> 1202.28
everything worse it gets a lot of

1200.24 --> 1205.6
Palestinians killed it doesn't fix

1202.28 --> 1209.52
anything it's always a mess until they

1205.6 --> 1213.6789999999999
are specifically isolated and separated

1209.52 --> 1215.6
from the general Jewish citizens and the

1213.679 --> 1217.88
Palestinian

1215.6 --> 1220.36
citizens it's all going to be a

1217.88 --> 1223.5200000000002
slaughter house every time something

1220.36 --> 1227.4399999999998
happens until it those specific things

1223.52 --> 1229.76
are completely separated and acted upon

1227.44 --> 1232.72
the separ

1229.76 --> 1236.44
ation it's going to be a giant slaughter

1232.72 --> 1239.919
house every time anything happens

1236.44 --> 1239.919
there that's a

1243.42 --> 1246.519
[Music]

1249.24 --> 1252.56
fact the

1251.08 --> 1255.6999999999998
illuminate

1252.56 --> 1255.7
[Music]

1257.12 --> 1260.12
okay

1267.36 --> 1271.039
the Illuminati I'm

1273.88 --> 1280.8400000000001
sorry I don't see how the Illuminati is

1277.0 --> 1280.84
behind it like what what is the

1284.799 --> 1289.4
purpose people don't seem to understand

1287.32 --> 1292.039
even the illumin

1289.4 --> 1294.919
like Illuminati the entire idea is like

1292.039 --> 1296.64
covert management is covert social

1294.919 --> 1300.44
engineering

1296.64 --> 1302.039
based Mass management that's like their

1300.44 --> 1306.44
entire

1302.039 --> 1309.72
objective so how is this

1306.44 --> 1311.279
Illuminati like how is this just this

1309.72 --> 1315.32
slaughter

1311.279 --> 1320.039
house helping the Illuminati

1315.32 --> 1320.039
agenda me Fred

1325.12 --> 1328.6
I doubt you're going to be answering

1326.559 --> 1332.3999999999999
that because that's going to require

1328.6 --> 1335.24
pretty good high IQ and all that but uh

1332.4 --> 1337.279
yeah people don't think about that like

1335.24 --> 1339.96
what the [ __ ] is the Illuminati supposed

1337.279 --> 1342.039
to do with this slaughter house what

1339.96 --> 1344.4
what's it good for it isn't good for

1342.039 --> 1348.48
anything you know what it does it just

1344.4 --> 1350.52
wakes people up to how [ __ ] insane

1348.48 --> 1353.32
things

1350.52 --> 1355.48
are yeah some people just get caught up

1353.32 --> 1357.72
in the frenzy they're lost to the war

1355.48 --> 1360.44
basically and others they it just

1357.72 --> 1362.96
becomes more and more obvious like holy

1360.44 --> 1365.52
[ __ ] this is so wrong kind of like what

1362.96 --> 1368.4
happened in Vietnam

1365.52 --> 1371.0
remember blatantly documented for those

1368.4 --> 1374.039
that aren't that

1371.0 --> 1377.2
old like At first everybody thought like

1374.039 --> 1379.4
yeah of course defend America blah blah

1377.2 --> 1382.3600000000001
blah and then they started to figure out

1379.4 --> 1385.159
like what the [ __ ] is actually

1382.36 --> 1389.1999999999998
happening and then they had to end that

1385.159 --> 1391.5200000000002
war because it was actually bad for the

1389.2 --> 1394.88
Illuminati

1391.52 --> 1400.24
yeah there's no real such group but

1394.88 --> 1401.7600000000002
there is a a direction a a method that's

1400.24 --> 1405.919
kind of out

1401.76 --> 1408.96
there a direction rulers can follow and

1405.919 --> 1411.64
it's does it was not good for any mind

1408.96 --> 1413.919
control it was waking people up and when

1411.64 --> 1415.6000000000001
it's waking a lot of people up it's not

1413.919 --> 1419.8400000000001
good for the Illuminati let's just say

1415.6 --> 1422.1999999999998
it like that yeah and this

1419.84 --> 1424.8799999999999
gigantic crazy [ __ ] that's been

1422.2 --> 1430.44
happening in Israel and all

1424.88 --> 1433.24
that like it has woken up more

1430.44 --> 1435.64
people than pretty

1433.24 --> 1439.36
like the amounts of people that are

1435.64 --> 1442.919
waking up to the fakery is is percentile

1439.36 --> 1445.52
wise growing steadily and it it might

1442.919 --> 1448.679
even be exponential like so many people

1445.52 --> 1451.08
are figuring out how messed up this is

1448.679 --> 1454.6000000000001
like more than people have figured out

1451.08 --> 1459.24
how messed up Ukraine situation

1454.6 --> 1463.52
is right because this thing of course is

1459.24 --> 1466.52
like more events like that happening

1463.52 --> 1466.52
when Ukraine is pretty

1466.799 --> 1469.799
recently

1470.559 --> 1472.76
it's the

1471.53 --> 1474.399
[Music]

1472.76 --> 1478.0
Freemasons

1474.399 --> 1478.0
okay hey what's going

1478.12 --> 1481.799
on YouTube was

1483.52 --> 1487.8799999999999
stalling how are the Free Masons

1490.399 --> 1496.399
involved I don't see

1493.2 --> 1499.52
it I know you're just like randomly

1496.399 --> 1501.399
saying things at this point but I I am

1499.52 --> 1504.08
that guy that's always going to take any

1501.399 --> 1507.399
remark of a [ __ ] not saying that you

1504.08 --> 1510.1589999999999
are a [ __ ] but just any random person

1507.399 --> 1514.08
like like it's a genius map or something

1510.159 --> 1517.3200000000002
and I have to Divine the genius inside

1514.08 --> 1520.3999999999999
behind it I do it every freaking

1517.32 --> 1520.3999999999999
[Music]

1522.52 --> 1531.12
time but yeah I don't see uh like what

1525.919 --> 1531.1200000000001
Freemasons would have to do the illumin

1533.559 --> 1540.6399999999999
yeah hey did you just delete the comment

1536.2 --> 1547.799
where did it go oh wait no there it

1540.64 --> 1547.7990000000002
is is this SE tappy no I don't think

1556.679 --> 1559.679
so

1567.039 --> 1572.52
if so then zp has an entire fake

1573.6 --> 1577.84
account with nonsense on

1586.6 --> 1589.6
it

1603.64 --> 1609.5200000000002
so there's no way they could be pushing

1605.64 --> 1611.0
people to wake up how overt things are

1609.52 --> 1614.84
of a paradigm

1611.0 --> 1619.48
sh who who

1614.84 --> 1622.8799999999999
like I mean the awaken

1619.48 --> 1625.64
supposedly right in media they're trying

1622.88 --> 1629.1200000000001
that but how is

1625.64 --> 1632.2
that you see the Illuminati it's always

1629.12 --> 1635.12
about those that are in control without

1632.2 --> 1637.799
you knowing they are in control so it's

1635.12 --> 1641.0
always whatever they do from a control

1637.799 --> 1643.36
perspective never to get control the

1641.0 --> 1645.76
point is is

1643.36 --> 1647.799
that they already got the control it's

1645.76 --> 1649.36
like how do you keep it without like

1647.799 --> 1653.279
being

1649.36 --> 1653.279
noticed it's a big part of

1658.6 --> 1666.039
it like I don't see how Illuminati have

1662.76 --> 1666.039
interest in a paradigm

1666.919 --> 1670.96
shift like that they would push

1676.519 --> 1679.519
it

1680.88 --> 1686.279
and well you could think of it maybe

1684.279 --> 1691.399
maybe they would but I

1686.279 --> 1694.24
mean if seriously guys do you know like

1691.399 --> 1697.0
how insanely egregious the situation

1694.24 --> 1698.72
would be if that were to be the

1697.0 --> 1703.44
case I

1698.72 --> 1706.2
mean that's literally the Mind

1703.44 --> 1709.1200000000001
controllers basically from that

1706.2 --> 1711.6000000000001
perspective being so unbelievably

1709.12 --> 1714.76
successful that they've managed to just

1711.6 --> 1716.7199999999998
make everybody believe a subpar system

1714.76 --> 1719.36
that they want to replace and they can't

1716.72 --> 1721.72
do it because the people are biting in

1719.36 --> 1724.6789999999999
it too much that they're not letting it

1721.72 --> 1727.279
go even when the Illuminati is

1724.679 --> 1729.279
manipulating them to let go by just

1727.279 --> 1732.88
showing the truth of it and still not

1729.279 --> 1732.88
working I mean I my

1735.519 --> 1742.0
God that's just Terri

1739.159 --> 1745.6000000000001
terrible I mean you're literally like

1742.0 --> 1748.12
the the evil mind controllers are trying

1745.6 --> 1750.9599999999998
to force us to wake up because we're too

1748.12 --> 1753.5189999999998
[ __ ] [ __ ] to wake up from the

1750.96 --> 1757.08
previous mind control Paradigm that

1753.519 --> 1759.559
we've been given by them I mean holy

1757.08 --> 1759.559
[ __ ]

1766.32 --> 1769.32
dude

1773.84 --> 1779.6399999999999
like does not make me feel very

1776.6 --> 1783.7199999999998
comfortable thinking of it like

1779.64 --> 1783.72
that it's a little bit

1796.32 --> 1799.32
much

1802.46 --> 1805.65
[Music]

1807.0 --> 1812.08
sometimes you go conspir we all do I

1809.48 --> 1816.64
mean that's how we ended up in this

1812.08 --> 1821.6789999999999
place but uh

1816.64 --> 1821.679
Instinct and a choice to go without an

1824.679 --> 1829.24
instinct think you might have a drinking

1827.039 --> 1829.24
problem

1832.12 --> 1835.799
oh okay that's not

1842.48 --> 1848.3600000000001
good symbolism in WWF WWE yeah but it's

1846.64 --> 1850.64
because they are basically like

1848.36 --> 1854.1999999999998
globalist projects and there's a lot of

1850.64 --> 1857.76
Mind Control in globalist

1854.2 --> 1860.76
projects right big big one wide

1857.76 --> 1864.12
organizations that reach a lot of

1860.76 --> 1866.6
people yeah it's riddled with mind

1864.12 --> 1866.6
control

1879.88 --> 1885.3200000000002
[ __ ] never any alcoh okay I was thinking

1884.2 --> 1887.799
like

1885.32 --> 1890.1589999999999
Damn alcohol is dangerous I mean if

1887.799 --> 1894.72
you're going to say drinking problem

1890.159 --> 1894.72
people are immediately going to think

1895.559 --> 1900.08
alcohol in the west at least

1903.84 --> 1908.72
so

1905.36 --> 1910.32
sugar right so you're sugar addicted

1908.72 --> 1913.919
okay

1910.32 --> 1913.9189999999999
clear that's a tough

1916.159 --> 1919.159
one

1919.36 --> 1926.039
oh borders boy Auto removed

1923.039 --> 1926.039
comment

1931.24 --> 1934.24
okay

1942.99 --> 1946.72
[Music]

1944.36 --> 1949.0
H right are you guys having fun I mean

1946.72 --> 1954.83
it's a short show we're halfway

1949.0 --> 1958.599
already but uh seems to be doing

1954.83 --> 1958.599
[Music]

1962.84 --> 1968.799
great at least I got a title but I mean

1965.559 --> 1971.36
I I got it yesterday so let me flick

1968.799 --> 1974.96
through my my band list to see if

1971.36 --> 1974.9599999999998
anybody's in there that shouldn't be in

1976.039 --> 1980.36
there

1977.679 --> 1982.679
like this [ __ ] doing this by the way is

1980.36 --> 1984.9189999999999
going to have a weird

1982.679 --> 1987.6000000000001
influence because

1984.919 --> 1990.2
like I'm getting freaked out by

1987.6 --> 1991.799
literally recognizing all the troll

1990.2 --> 1994.8400000000001
names

1991.799 --> 1997.519
now like it's becoming subconscious it's

1994.84 --> 2001.279
like I just know who you

1997.519 --> 2005.279
are based on the combination of name and

2001.279 --> 2007.559
picture like even when you try to go

2005.279 --> 2009.799
undercover cuz most people they can't

2007.559 --> 2011.96
help but

2009.799 --> 2015.72
still give

2011.96 --> 2019.919
it like remnants of their original

2015.72 --> 2019.919
identity because it is identity

2022.399 --> 2028.1589999999999
based it's just fascinating the

2025.559 --> 2030.6
system that has been developed like

2028.159 --> 2032.88
subconsciously dealing with freaking

2030.6 --> 2035.7199999999998
socks

2032.88 --> 2038.279
everywhere and it's it's a mechanism

2035.72 --> 2040.039
that's not you I can't just pointed out

2038.279 --> 2042.799
how it

2040.039 --> 2045.24
works but there's something working a

2042.799 --> 2049.56
mechanism has been created that's

2045.24 --> 2051.52
happening when I do this in my mind it's

2049.56 --> 2053.599
fascinating I'm getting like a lot

2051.52 --> 2055.639
quicker at it

2053.599 --> 2058.28
too

2055.639 --> 2061.28
because I am terrible at

2058.28 --> 2061.28
names

2061.839 --> 2068.52
normally I'm not good at them so it's

2065.28 --> 2070.76
like different it's like I I don't

2068.52 --> 2074.04
memorize it on

2070.76 --> 2075.32
names I memorize it almost on a little

2074.04 --> 2078.679
visual

2075.32 --> 2083.44
icon because I can do that you know I

2078.679 --> 2086.48
can like memorize the name as a name or

2083.44 --> 2089.96
as a visual and that's a different

2086.48 --> 2089.96
mechanism it works

2090.13 --> 2093.679
[Music]

2091.399 --> 2095.0789999999997
differently and when there's especially

2093.679 --> 2098.839
when there's more than just letters

2095.079 --> 2102.8
there's pictures there it greatly

2098.839 --> 2105.119
enhances that mechanism and my visual

2102.8 --> 2106.7200000000003
memory you could say is a lot better

2105.119 --> 2108.88
than

2106.72 --> 2112.52
my name

2108.88 --> 2112.52
Memory my verbal

2112.599 --> 2116.88
memory if that if it is even the verbal

2115.119 --> 2118.8
memory I mean I have a pretty good word

2116.88 --> 2121.7200000000003
range right it's just names I don't

2118.8 --> 2121.7200000000003
remember them very

2121.88 --> 2127.44
well a great visual memories in your 20s

2125.0 --> 2129.2
oh okay I still do

2127.44 --> 2132.839
and I'm in my

2129.2 --> 2136.64
40s but I mean me literally working on

2132.839 --> 2138.96
it all the time like even when I didn't

2136.64 --> 2142.839
have a life which a lot of it I didn't

2138.96 --> 2145.48
really I'd always be doing that like

2142.839 --> 2147.599
I've been like I decided like I'm a

2145.48 --> 2149.88
freaking wizard I'm going to be like

2147.599 --> 2152.1600000000003
mastering

2149.88 --> 2154.119
visualization and I

2152.16 --> 2156.8799999999997
have an

2154.119 --> 2158.6800000000003
explanation so it's not just all all the

2156.88 --> 2161.2000000000003
Wizardry in the world but I'm the only

2158.68 --> 2163.64
one that could see it no I can actually

2161.2 --> 2163.64
explain

2167.56 --> 2172.48
it not you you let it slip oh that's too

2175.44 --> 2181.76
bad ah okay there is an fed today Nathan

2179.04 --> 2181.7599999999998
just threw out the

2181.91 --> 2188.72
[Music]

2185.72 --> 2188.72
link

2190.359 --> 2197.2799999999997
visualizing and explaining go ahead yes

2192.88 --> 2197.28
that's why that's why I chose

2198.72 --> 2206.04
that and even when I was much younger

2202.119 --> 2208.7200000000003
people teachers typically teachers that

2206.04 --> 2212.72
were really good at it really talented

2208.72 --> 2215.7599999999998
like I worship them it's like you are so

2212.72 --> 2218.359
sharp you are so refined it's like so

2215.76 --> 2220.3590000000004
perfect in side and I can see it I can

2218.359 --> 2223.0789999999997
see what you're doing I can see how

2220.359 --> 2227.0789999999997
sharp you are and I worshiped it it's

2223.079 --> 2229.8390000000004
like that's what I want I want

2227.079 --> 2232.2400000000002
that and so that's what I worked on most

2229.839 --> 2232.24
of my

2232.28 --> 2239.599
life like that understanding the

2235.48 --> 2242.599
oversight being like understanding how

2239.599 --> 2245.2400000000002
other people's Insight works and how it

2242.599 --> 2248.0
builds up and like

2245.24 --> 2250.52
how when you shift factors about

2248.0 --> 2254.0
people's intelligence or memory capacity

2250.52 --> 2257.0
or trauma level like how it

2254.0 --> 2259.079
functions that's what I've like really

2257.0 --> 2261.2
studied and that is what a teacher must

2259.079 --> 2262.88
study because a teacher must if they

2261.2 --> 2265.52
really want to be any good they must

2262.88 --> 2266.88
adapt to whatever capability their

2265.52 --> 2269.64
student is

2266.88 --> 2271.44
at and it might even change so they have

2269.64 --> 2272.16
to be dynamic in that sense they have to

2271.44 --> 2274.96
have

2272.16 --> 2277.04
that not even have to have that

2274.96 --> 2278.8
conscious they just they will deal with

2277.04 --> 2281.2799999999997
it and they will become good at it over

2278.8 --> 2283.6400000000003
the years they keep stick to that

2281.28 --> 2284.92
profession I've had to like con

2283.64 --> 2287.92
basically

2284.92 --> 2290.52
like it's part of my introspective

2287.92 --> 2293.119
Journey just learn

2290.52 --> 2295.599
that and I mean I've studied here right

2293.119 --> 2297.839
in the open on on the early bird show

2295.599 --> 2300.96
like with my rage win Outburst it's like

2297.839 --> 2303.599
yeah I'm studying it like I get outburst

2300.96 --> 2305.8
and then I study like what did it look

2303.599 --> 2308.48
like how is it different how did it

2305.8 --> 2311.6400000000003
change my mind mind how did it change my

2308.48 --> 2313.96
feelings how did it open doors that

2311.64 --> 2315.92
aren't normally

2313.96 --> 2320.04
open to

2315.92 --> 2322.16
me and is that any good did it because

2320.04 --> 2325.52
sometimes those doors open just to like

2322.16 --> 2328.64
ah wrath but sometimes it opens the door

2325.52 --> 2331.04
to give you a look as to like what would

2328.64 --> 2333.56
happen or

2331.04 --> 2335.599
something so you can get a glimpse by

2333.56 --> 2337.24
just enacting that rich you can get a

2335.599 --> 2341.599
glimpse of what somebody else in that

2337.24 --> 2343.9599999999996
position might see and not just like oh

2341.599 --> 2346.48
they will get angry oh that will

2343.96 --> 2348.52
probably escalate right that's not

2346.48 --> 2351.92
empathizing but like when you're

2348.52 --> 2355.28
actually enraged about it then you can

2351.92 --> 2358.599
like get in that mindset in that moment

2355.28 --> 2360.3590000000004
much closer and actually like enact what

2358.599 --> 2362.7200000000003
would naturally

2360.359 --> 2366.24
crystallize what would actually happen

2362.72 --> 2368.52
much closer to just a generalization

2366.24 --> 2372.359
like oh they got

2368.52 --> 2376.48
angry right understanding the

2372.359 --> 2379.5989999999997
anger what it does to you how that

2376.48 --> 2382.119
changes the perspective of people's

2379.599 --> 2382.119
State of

2382.24 --> 2388.0789999999997
Mind how it blinds them to certain

2384.92 --> 2390.92
things but opens other doors that you

2388.079 --> 2394.48
just don't even realize in a normal

2390.92 --> 2394.48
State of Mind are

2395.4 --> 2398.4
there

2398.68 --> 2404.68
the angry doors you could call them I

2401.52 --> 2404.68
got access to angry

2410.92 --> 2417.64
doors right I even use it I use it for

2415.0 --> 2420.319
dramatic purposes on my

2417.64 --> 2423.7999999999997
show to

2420.319 --> 2428.359
like give more weight more energy more

2423.8 --> 2428.3590000000004
force behind certain statements

2428.88 --> 2438.119
that weight is real because the anger is

2433.28 --> 2441.0
real and it's really that yeah it's real

2438.119 --> 2444.28
it's not fake anger I'm not

2441.0 --> 2446.8
like I want attention I'm really angry

2444.28 --> 2448.8
no I am actually really freaking angry

2446.8 --> 2451.28
and then it's real and then everything

2448.8 --> 2453.7200000000003
that happens because of that is real and

2451.28 --> 2455.599
people respect that they recognize it's

2453.72 --> 2458.319
not somebody acting like they're angry

2455.599 --> 2458.319
they're actually

2459.599 --> 2466.92
angry and people respect it when angry

2463.04 --> 2469.359
people have control over their faculties

2466.92 --> 2471.4
and their expressions as they are angry

2469.359 --> 2472.4
because it's a very tough skill on a lot

2471.4 --> 2474.04
of

2472.4 --> 2476.7200000000003
people

2474.04 --> 2480.36
so you get respect for that because it's

2476.72 --> 2483.5699999999997
real it's not acted

2480.36 --> 2483.57
[Music]

2484.0 --> 2490.599
anger right and that's another

2486.839 --> 2493.0
example right rage win controlling

2490.599 --> 2495.3590000000004
that understanding rage understanding

2493.0 --> 2497.48
other people's rage because of it and

2495.359 --> 2500.0789999999997
for other people to look into this show

2497.48 --> 2502.48
and also be able to get a glimpse and

2500.079 --> 2505.1600000000003
understanding others people anger

2502.48 --> 2508.319
better it

2505.16 --> 2513.04
is grabbing the opportunity in a crisis

2508.319 --> 2516.599
because why do you get angry crisis like

2513.04 --> 2519.359
logically like something goes wrong you

2516.599 --> 2523.6400000000003
might get angry over it something is bad

2519.359 --> 2523.64
or injust you get angry over it

2524.56 --> 2528.48
crisis but you can grab

2528.8 --> 2536.1600000000003
them you can learn better so why is this

2533.4 --> 2537.7200000000003
all happening how do I work how do other

2536.16 --> 2541.68
people

2537.72 --> 2545.9199999999996
work how can we use that forign

2541.68 --> 2549.7999999999997
knowledge to to plan to to build a road

2545.92 --> 2549.8
for when the scenario

2550.61 --> 2555.48
[Music]

2552.4 --> 2558.04
arrives so that we don't get lost when

2555.48 --> 2560.72
we suddenly get angry right cuz if you

2558.04 --> 2562.839
don't know anger if you know what it

2560.72 --> 2565.7599999999998
does to you you don't learn how to deal

2562.839 --> 2567.7599999999998
with it then when you do get angry you

2565.76 --> 2569.2400000000002
things you lose control things get out

2567.76 --> 2572.76
of

2569.24 --> 2575.16
hand if you do learn about

2572.76 --> 2579.76
it then you

2575.16 --> 2584.319
can prevent it from doing damage to your

2579.76 --> 2586.1600000000003
life or other people's lives and maybe

2584.319 --> 2590.0
even open some

2586.16 --> 2595.0
doors you know use it in a in a

2590.0 --> 2595.0
constructive way which is risky but it's

2599.319 --> 2605.079
doable ah you're drinking talking about

2602.68 --> 2606.64
disgusting

2605.079 --> 2609.6800000000003
mainstream

2606.64 --> 2613.1189999999997
fizzy sugary drinks that's

2609.68 --> 2614.9199999999996
terrible don't drink soda I've I've

2613.119 --> 2621.52
abandoned all

2614.92 --> 2625.599
soda like 10 years ago best thing I ever

2621.52 --> 2628.28
did soda all of it like even organic

2625.599 --> 2630.52
it's all terrible cuz it's not even

2628.28 --> 2633.52
about the ingredients it's

2630.52 --> 2635.079
about what that combination typically

2633.52 --> 2637.68
does to your

2635.079 --> 2641.319
body

2637.68 --> 2643.44
it is like candy diluted in a in a in a

2641.319 --> 2646.7599999999998
piece of water

2643.44 --> 2646.76
basically not

2652.119 --> 2657.1600000000003
good okay you talking it out cuz you you

2655.2 --> 2658.16
want to get rid of it right okay fair

2657.16 --> 2660.92
enough

2658.16 --> 2663.7599999999998
teret I'm just saying like ever since I

2660.92 --> 2666.8
quit it it's a lot

2663.76 --> 2669.079
better I think even that like

2666.8 --> 2673.0
that sort of

2669.079 --> 2675.6400000000003
thing like sugary drinks fizzy drinks

2673.0 --> 2679.48
that they've probably have been more of

2675.64 --> 2683.04
a risk for me to to get diabetes than

2679.48 --> 2686.92
any other thing that I've ever done like

2683.04 --> 2689.64
sugar Wise It's specifically like

2686.92 --> 2692.319
Coca-Cola crap and all the other ones

2689.64 --> 2696.0
too Pepsi and all that [ __ ] it's not not

2692.319 --> 2701.44
better at all and even like organic for

2696.0 --> 2701.44
R of that like that stuff is

2705.04 --> 2709.64
bad especially when you think you can

2707.4 --> 2712.359
just drink it all the

2709.64 --> 2714.44
time it's really bad and I've seen by

2712.359 --> 2715.44
the way people that are like severely

2714.44 --> 2720.0
addicted

2715.44 --> 2722.48
to to that to Cola that were literally

2720.0 --> 2722.48
in their

2722.64 --> 2730.8799999999997
30s this fact like a freaking

2727.319 --> 2734.5589999999997
balloon pure Cola

2730.88 --> 2737.0
addiction like multiple bottles to dude

2734.559 --> 2740.0400000000004
it's so messed up it's a miracle that

2737.0 --> 2743.599
that guy was even able to be alive in

2740.04 --> 2747.599
that state wait look

2743.599 --> 2751.2400000000002
just but ever since I saw that which was

2747.599 --> 2754.88
like around between 2006

2751.24 --> 2756.7999999999997
2010 it's just like

2754.88 --> 2758.96
whoa

2756.8 --> 2760.92
it it was right around the time that it

2758.96 --> 2763.64
was going full organic and at that point

2760.92 --> 2767.119
I was realizing like

2763.64 --> 2769.16
yeah yeah really do this you really got

2767.119 --> 2773.52
to go organic you really got to stop the

2769.16 --> 2777.7599999999998
fizzy drinks like really do that

2773.52 --> 2777.7599999999998
because it really can go

2784.8 --> 2787.8
terrible

2796.319 --> 2802.079
oh so you quit and you got back on

2798.88 --> 2805.52
that's tough but I mean if you want to

2802.079 --> 2808.6800000000003
bypass that a good way is to like always

2805.52 --> 2812.44
have a bottle of water with

2808.68 --> 2815.7999999999997
you or a bottle of fruit

2812.44 --> 2817.48
juice right but I mean when I went for

2815.8 --> 2821.04
organic

2817.48 --> 2823.48
teret you know what I did what I had to

2821.04 --> 2826.88
do from that point on is literally

2823.48 --> 2829.28
always have a bottle with me a bottle of

2826.88 --> 2832.1600000000003
water for

2829.28 --> 2836.44
starters because I wasn't going to be

2832.16 --> 2839.8799999999997
able to drink anything anywhere because

2836.44 --> 2842.92
organic and it wasn't

2839.88 --> 2844.52
anywhere I was very lucky to bump into

2842.92 --> 2846.6800000000003
anything organic so I always had to

2844.52 --> 2849.24
bring my own food with me like even to

2846.68 --> 2851.3999999999996
parties and all that and bring my own

2849.24 --> 2854.5589999999997
drinks with

2851.4 --> 2856.96
me and when you do that you don't get

2854.559 --> 2859.88
seduced to like oh I got

2856.96 --> 2861.52
to I'm going to take one anyway right

2859.88 --> 2864.04
you get seduced less because you got

2861.52 --> 2864.04
your own

2870.96 --> 2876.319
Supply don't sell

2873.68 --> 2879.839
them at the time

2876.319 --> 2879.839
then make sure that you got some

2880.359 --> 2888.7599999999998
backup right bring backup with you

2884.319 --> 2891.24
teret or make sure that you buy backup

2888.76 --> 2891.2400000000002
before

2893.96 --> 2902.28
midnight I mean buying your

2898.119 --> 2904.6400000000003
stuff in bulk ahead of time is cheaper

2902.28 --> 2906.48
anyway I mean what's the worst about it

2904.64 --> 2907.24
that you have to drag a couple of cans

2906.48 --> 2910.96
with

2907.24 --> 2913.839
you but it's a lot cheaper you always

2910.96 --> 2915.559
get the right pick because you're the

2913.839 --> 2919.68
one buying

2915.559 --> 2919.6800000000003
it and you always have it with

2924.319 --> 2929.2
you and especially with fruit juices

2927.0 --> 2933.599
they don't necessarily have to be kept

2929.2 --> 2937.5989999999997
that super cold or anything to be great

2933.599 --> 2937.599
so yeah

2954.64 --> 2958.319
trying to follow what you guys are

2956.0 --> 2958.319
talking

2964.52 --> 2967.52
about

2968.24 --> 2973.64
what oh you're talking to bers what's

2970.76 --> 2973.6400000000003
going on between

2980.4 --> 2983.4
you

2991.559 --> 2996.48
what yeah I agree with Border's boy

2994.88 --> 3001.079
there

2996.48 --> 3004.119
disposable consume culture is

3001.079 --> 3007.1600000000003
terrible I've always been a great fan of

3004.119 --> 3009.48
recycling I I was raised the hippie it's

3007.16 --> 3009.48
very

3009.92 --> 3015.7200000000003
serious it's kind of neurotic but I I

3013.4 --> 3020.6800000000003
really mean

3015.72 --> 3023.72
it and so yeah oh an easy can or some

3020.68 --> 3026.7599999999998
bottle drink even

3023.72 --> 3027.8799999999997
like my beer B when I was drinking them

3026.76 --> 3030.76
were

3027.88 --> 3033.92
recycled like I wouldn't

3030.76 --> 3038.599
buy a drink from anything that wouldn't

3033.92 --> 3038.599
be recycled at this point I

3040.88 --> 3048.079
refuse very serious like

3045.079 --> 3050.799
seriously hippie geek or whatever but I

3048.079 --> 3054.079
mean nerd whatever you want to but it's

3050.799 --> 3056.44
pretty damn serious for me it's

3054.079 --> 3058.48
like and it's it's not even because oh

3056.44 --> 3061.079
my God I can't afford to have that one

3058.48 --> 3062.319
bottle being thrown away in the glass or

3061.079 --> 3065.119
it's

3062.319 --> 3068.52
about that anything that's just not

3065.119 --> 3071.0
doing that at this point is like are you

3068.52 --> 3073.119
really yeah for example I'm kind of

3071.0 --> 3077.4
disappointed that those bottles from the

3073.119 --> 3080.359
Gusto drinks aren't like they're

3077.4 --> 3082.48
not like recycled so yeah they're

3080.359 --> 3085.5589999999997
recycled in the glass but I mean it

3082.48 --> 3089.28
breaks it just goes through that way and

3085.559 --> 3091.3590000000004
it's not super efficient

3089.28 --> 3093.119
like I don't know what I'm saying at

3091.359 --> 3095.319
this point it's just that a lot of

3093.119 --> 3098.119
companies that really have like cheap

3095.319 --> 3099.88
plastic bottles or whatever like small

3098.119 --> 3102.1600000000003
plastic bottles for drinks those are the

3099.88 --> 3104.559
worst and they even like plastic bottles

3102.16 --> 3106.0789999999997
and all that leech and [ __ ] it's

3104.559 --> 3110.76
terrible

3106.079 --> 3110.76
but Chad died again what are you talking

3113.68 --> 3117.7599999999998
about what are you talking about

3121.079 --> 3124.4
us what's

3126.48 --> 3129.48
wrong

3132.359 --> 3137.799
right this surup is not available oh

3135.319 --> 3140.72
there's some weird

3137.799 --> 3144.28
bugs okay well I hope you're the only

3140.72 --> 3147.2799999999997
one that's having that not everybody

3144.28 --> 3147.28
else

3148.52 --> 3156.0
I don't drink out of plast yeah me

3151.359 --> 3156.0
neither like ever I learn about bis

3157.0 --> 3161.799
Fen

3158.599 --> 3164.52
yeah like get the hell away from plastic

3161.799 --> 3167.88
bottles and that's why I have

3164.52 --> 3169.599
a glass water bottle and yeah that's a

3167.88 --> 3173.599
freaking weight that you'd be carrying

3169.599 --> 3177.6400000000003
but I mean I gladly take that

3173.599 --> 3177.6400000000003
weight I gladly take

3178.079 --> 3184.6800000000003
it like if I had to go anywhere right I

3182.119 --> 3186.44
will take a little bit of weight with me

3184.68 --> 3188.839
no

3186.44 --> 3192.0
problem cuz I'm not drinking out of a

3188.839 --> 3194.48
damn plastic thing like I've had times

3192.0 --> 3197.319
where I'd be really thirsty and somebody

3194.48 --> 3200.599
would offer me that and I just say like

3197.319 --> 3203.0
no just no I'll stay thirsty I refuse to

3200.599 --> 3204.1600000000003
drink from plastic I just really refuse

3203.0 --> 3207.16
to do

3204.16 --> 3207.16
that

3218.48 --> 3226.119
biod from biodegradable Agri waste yeah

3222.92 --> 3227.96
oh yeah but recycling look ter there's

3226.119 --> 3230.6400000000003
there is a pretty interesting future

3227.96 --> 3233.0
with like recycling they've already like

3230.64 --> 3236.8799999999997
they're really doing their best on these

3233.0 --> 3239.04
like this replacement plastic

3236.88 --> 3241.52
that's basically like made from

3239.04 --> 3244.88
starch and they're getting better and

3241.52 --> 3247.799
better at it it's becoming less

3244.88 --> 3250.52
fragile and it's like a pretty it's

3247.799 --> 3252.96
becoming a pretty decent

3250.52 --> 3254.319
replacement and that stuff literally you

3252.96 --> 3257.2400000000002
could just burn it up and there's

3254.319 --> 3258.88
absolutely no negative side effects or

3257.24 --> 3261.7599999999998
you could put it in the ground and it'll

3258.88 --> 3265.96
be like completely gone in

3261.76 --> 3269.7200000000003
just in in just a month or something

3265.96 --> 3272.119
not probably longer but quick so there

3269.72 --> 3272.1189999999997
is

3272.76 --> 3279.1600000000003
Solutions already got paper cups and all

3275.359 --> 3279.16
that which is much less

3280.28 --> 3284.599
damaging it's a great idea and

3282.16 --> 3286.5989999999997
profitable yes and dude starch there's

3284.599 --> 3290.799
no shortage of

3286.599 --> 3292.6400000000003
starch it's very rudimentary so yeah

3290.799 --> 3295.4
it's great it's a good

3292.64 --> 3299.2799999999997
future and hey there's still a future

3295.4 --> 3302.6800000000003
for Plastics as well just not for

3299.28 --> 3306.3190000000004
disposable Goods you

3302.68 --> 3308.64
see plastic can be incredibly great

3306.319 --> 3311.4
material fantastic what you can do with

3308.64 --> 3313.24
it it can be so specific and what kind

3311.4 --> 3316.6800000000003
of properties you wanted to have and all

3313.24 --> 3319.5989999999997
that and that's great I like plastic I

3316.68 --> 3324.0
really like that it exists but it should

3319.599 --> 3329.0
be used very specifically and not

3324.0 --> 3332.16
for like like quickly throw disposable

3329.0 --> 3333.24
throw away Goods absolutely not and

3332.16 --> 3336.24
that's an

3333.24 --> 3341.2
atrocity that that's being

3336.24 --> 3344.24
done in my opinion but hey if you have

3341.2 --> 3347.24
like a good monitor there's a lot of

3344.24 --> 3350.2799999999997
plastic pieces on it but it's great it's

3347.24 --> 3352.24
great and it's going to last a long time

3350.28 --> 3353.92
right because it's not like oh you buy a

3352.24 --> 3356.0389999999998
monitor and then you expect to throw it

3353.92 --> 3358.48
in the trash like in in a month or

3356.039 --> 3359.559
something no you're going to last a

3358.48 --> 3363.72
while with

3359.559 --> 3363.7200000000003
that and so it's great for

3364.72 --> 3368.7599999999998
that and who knows maybe eventually

3367.16 --> 3370.48
we'll find even something

3368.76 --> 3373.48
[Music]

3370.48 --> 3375.92
better another

3373.48 --> 3378.039
material but you could always then still

3375.92 --> 3380.16
like use plastic for just when you

3378.039 --> 3382.48
really need the plastic

3380.16 --> 3386.839
properties and then for something that

3382.48 --> 3389.4
lasts a very long time

3386.839 --> 3392.52
but the point is it needs to plastic

3389.4 --> 3395.52
needs to be maneuvered out of disposable

3392.52 --> 3395.52
Goods

3396.96 --> 3407.4
quickly and especially

3402.24 --> 3408.72
like careful think tanking about how to

3407.4 --> 3411.64
avoid

3408.72 --> 3414.9199999999996
microplastic because that is a

3411.64 --> 3418.0
problem it mostly because of disposable

3414.92 --> 3419.359
plastic use but in general it is a a bit

3418.0 --> 3423.28
of a

3419.359 --> 3426.4
problem so it's like how do you prevent

3423.28 --> 3430.92
microplastic should be like a the

3426.4 --> 3432.64
main Think Tank

3430.92 --> 3436.7200000000003
environmentalist

3432.64 --> 3439.5589999999997
question like how do you stop that from

3436.72 --> 3441.5989999999997
happening and not just immediately oh

3439.559 --> 3445.44
just do this oh just get rid of all PL

3441.599 --> 3450.44
no no no like how do you like change

3445.44 --> 3452.48
the way it's used or even how what the

3450.44 --> 3456.96
material itself how it's used how can

3452.48 --> 3460.119
you just avoid microplastic from

3456.96 --> 3461.07
happening by changing like the nature of

3460.119 --> 3462.559
it or

3461.07 --> 3463.81
[Music]

3462.559 --> 3467.0600000000004
something all

3463.81 --> 3467.06
[Music]

3467.24 --> 3473.7599999999998
right because I mean yeah fishing the

3471.48 --> 3476.52
plastic out of the ocean that's a noble

3473.76 --> 3479.44
job right it's good but I mean it's

3476.52 --> 3479.44
there's so much of

3479.839 --> 3484.64
it and it's going to keep coming that's

3482.44 --> 3490.4
the problem

3484.64 --> 3490.4
until the use of plastic has been

3491.839 --> 3498.0389999999998
adapted like a standard adaptation of

3494.76 --> 3500.88
like this is just this is how we're

3498.039 --> 3500.88
going to have to use

3503.039 --> 3509.2000000000003
plastic destroying the Planet that's a

3506.68 --> 3510.9199999999996
that's a unfortunate choice of words

3509.2 --> 3513.5989999999997
there blue pill Evolution hello by the

3510.92 --> 3513.599
way good to see

3518.839 --> 3525.72
you right and I disagree I don't think

3521.44 --> 3528.96
plastic is destroying the planet it's

3525.72 --> 3531.5589999999997
disposable plastic that is really

3528.96 --> 3531.559
ruining

3533.72 --> 3538.2799999999997
things

3535.72 --> 3540.52
like for example freaking windmills you

3538.28 --> 3542.76
know those [ __ ] things are made of

3540.52 --> 3545.799
plastic and they break down and then

3542.76 --> 3549.1600000000003
they have to bury a giant gigantic piece

3545.799 --> 3550.16
of plastic that is just an atrocity

3549.16 --> 3551.92
beyond

3550.16 --> 3556.24
belief to

3551.92 --> 3556.2400000000002
me it's the worst thing you could

3563.48 --> 3567.559
do go Coca-Cola bottles come in plastic

3566.68 --> 3570.7599999999998
yeah

3567.559 --> 3575.52
the but I mean that's just like

3570.76 --> 3575.5200000000004
Warehouse plastic stuff there it I

3577.16 --> 3582.68
mean

3579.4 --> 3585.079
yeah by the way it's very likely that if

3582.68 --> 3589.0
like the whole starch based plastic

3585.079 --> 3592.0
replacement really goes full force that

3589.0 --> 3593.76
it's going to basically replace wareh

3592.0 --> 3596.64
house plastic sheets and all that as

3593.76 --> 3596.6400000000003
well

3597.52 --> 3600.52
eventually

3600.559 --> 3607.2000000000003
hopefully but I mean a lot of we how

3603.119 --> 3607.2000000000003
plastic wraps are just like pretty

3609.319 --> 3615.92
recyclable but there is a lot of junk

3613.319 --> 3615.92
there

3617.28 --> 3620.53
[Music]

3623.559 --> 3626.559
truly

3627.94 --> 3631.0190000000002
[Music]

3631.48 --> 3636.68
right I'm going to round out the show it

3634.359 --> 3639.2799999999997
was a short show but I still thought we

3636.68 --> 3639.2799999999997
had fun

3639.359 --> 3644.48
right I actually think it's probably

3642.039 --> 3646.48
better than yesterday's show that went

3644.48 --> 3649.799
completely

3646.48 --> 3652.48
sour like I suddenly started to feel bad

3649.799 --> 3655.4
at some point and just like poof it's

3652.48 --> 3660.16
like I suddenly sank

3655.4 --> 3662.559
it got like really like like it hurt and

3660.16 --> 3664.2799999999997
it's like I got spontaneously

3662.559 --> 3666.3190000000004
demoralized and there's like I couldn't

3664.28 --> 3668.039
even pinpoint it to any information it

3666.319 --> 3670.24
just

3668.039 --> 3674.6800000000003
bof it just

3670.24 --> 3677.24
dropped and it didn't get back up

3674.68 --> 3678.5989999999997
and didn't have that today I thought

3677.24 --> 3680.16
today was pretty

3678.599 --> 3683.44
fluid

3680.16 --> 3685.0
and well-tempered didn't really get

3683.44 --> 3687.599
really angry or anything

3685.0 --> 3690.039
despite potential troll

3687.599 --> 3691.1600000000003
activity so I think that Today's show

3690.039 --> 3693.88
was

3691.16 --> 3696.92
great you're not a fan of short shows

3693.88 --> 3698.48
