[Music]

170.76 --> 178.16
11 degrees Celsius huh it's even

174.48 --> 178.16
warmer than I thought it would be

180.0 --> 185.34
it says it's going to be mostly cloudy

182.4 --> 187.26000000000002
so good for that

185.34 --> 190.26
because I still have to go out and to

yesterday

203.76 --> 207.84
all right anyway yeah the Flat Earth

206.58 --> 209.70000000000002
debates

207.84 --> 212.159
or let's just started with my show my

209.7 --> 214.319
show was great

212.159 --> 215.94
I haven't actually watched it back I

214.319 --> 218.659
should watch it back because I think it

215.94 --> 218.659
was really great

220.86 --> 225.31900000000002
getting all mechanical I should watch it

223.14 --> 225.319
back

227.22 --> 229.94
uh

230.159 --> 233.4
right but the Flat Earth debates

232.11 --> 237.18
[Music]

233.4 --> 239.64000000000001
was yeah I mean that was a lot of fun

237.18 --> 240.49
didn't last super long one hour after

239.64 --> 242.64
show but

240.49 --> 244.739
[Music]

242.64 --> 248.17999999999998
it was yeah

244.739 --> 248.18
pretty high energy and

250.5 --> 255.959
just yeah was good

252.9 --> 258.799
got some moments in there

255.959 --> 258.799
uh

261.9 --> 266.419
hello LSG first in chat good to see you

266.759 --> 270.139
oh look now

271.5 --> 278.0
now the chat is

274.02 --> 278.0
not starting at the top

279.24 --> 285.06
at least in in here in the video

282.24 --> 288.18
remember yesterday how the the chat

285.06 --> 292.259
would stop a start at the top going down

288.18 --> 296.0
or in YouTube it looks like that

292.259 --> 296.0
top down but not

296.16 --> 302.52000000000004
in the screen over there so what I don't

300.96 --> 304.85999999999996
get it

302.52 --> 308.46
whatever

304.86 --> 308.46000000000004
weird inconsistencies

310.199 --> 314.12
anyway how are you doing LSG

316.56 --> 323.3
I see you got the uh

319.979 --> 323.3
the bit shoot video

323.4 --> 327.539
I I thought that you would think it was

325.199 --> 329.039
hilarious

327.539 --> 330.9
I'll share it with everybody it's

329.039 --> 333.84
something Owen Benjamin posted in his

330.9 --> 336.44
bit shoot about the Shire and it's

333.84 --> 336.44
brilliant

337.139 --> 343.38
it's absolutely brilliant and especially

340.8 --> 345.62
for LSG since while he lives in the

343.38 --> 345.62
Shire

349.32 --> 353.21999999999997
pretty much

350.82 --> 354.78
anyway

353.22 --> 356.34000000000003
uh

354.78 --> 358.32
yeah I've been catching up on Owen

356.34 --> 360.479
Benjamin some great streams I had some

358.32 --> 363.8
issue getting through it because he was

360.479 --> 363.8
like sick

363.9 --> 369.479
and that like is not very pleasant

366.6 --> 374.46000000000004
because it kind of rubs off on me

369.479 --> 374.46
so but it's getting better apparently

379.56 --> 382.199
and the subjects have been very

381.18 --> 383.88
interesting

382.199 --> 385.8
as usual

383.88 --> 387.78
really good letters

385.8 --> 391.40000000000003
here and there

387.78 --> 391.4
and some hilarious sketches

392.28 --> 395.23999999999995
last I watched I think it's like from

394.199 --> 397.62
Wednesday

395.24 --> 401.72
what was it

397.62 --> 401.72
or Tuesday even I'm not sure

402.18 --> 405.86
oh yeah it was basically

408.18 --> 416.58
oh and like reviewing some critic critic

412.56 --> 419.699
video no credit a video made by Joe

416.58 --> 423.479
Rogan's dad and family

419.699 --> 426.90000000000003
being pissed off at Joe Rogan

423.479 --> 430.68
and there was like so Hand movie moving

426.9 --> 433.85999999999996
with their hands in like Italian style

430.68 --> 436.44
that he was like yeah they're it's just

433.86 --> 437.22
like they're doing some messed up kind

436.44 --> 441.599
of

437.22 --> 444.62
uh deaf language and signals so then he

441.599 --> 448.21999999999997
started to do a for the deaf translation

444.62 --> 451.86
with typical deaf voice

448.22 --> 455.09900000000005
it was really freaking funny

451.86 --> 458.18
I laughed so hard at that even though I

455.099 --> 458.18
was middle of the night

461.28 --> 467.099
a huge smile on your face and needed

463.319 --> 469.34000000000003
that okay awesome that's great

467.099 --> 469.34
foreign

474.53 --> 477.65999999999997
[Music]

484.63 --> 488.98
[Music]

486.259 --> 490.259
anyway yeah I started a bit late today

488.98 --> 492.84000000000003
[Music]

490.259 --> 495.68
it's just he didn't go to bed that late

492.84 --> 495.67999999999995
it's just that

497.28 --> 501.35999999999996
I had some I needed some extra dream

499.379 --> 505.40000000000003
sleep I was really dreamy this morning

501.36 --> 505.40000000000003
when the alarm clock went off

505.56 --> 510.199
that's some weird socializing dreams

510.419 --> 515.52
and yeah that is weird

513.719 --> 518.58
because I don't socialize that much

515.52 --> 521.5799999999999
anymore and but sometimes like in my

518.58 --> 523.08
dreams I like keep myself trained or

521.58 --> 526.2
something

523.08 --> 529.019
and then I take back typical socializing

526.2 --> 531.24
situations that I've been in before like

529.019 --> 533.1
for example my

531.24 --> 535.86
my

533.1 --> 538.32
Dungeons and Dragons group I mean that

535.86 --> 540.0
was socializing yet they were kind of

538.32 --> 542.4590000000001
nerds and all that

540.0 --> 544.32
different types

542.459 --> 547.4399999999999
but still

544.32 --> 549.5400000000001
so and since I actually missed that I

547.44 --> 550.5
tend to sometimes dream about it and

549.54 --> 552.24
then

550.5 --> 554.58
basically

552.24 --> 557.22
take control over the dream and start

554.58 --> 560.64
while talking to them in a very direct

557.22 --> 562.6800000000001
way that it's very weird

560.64 --> 564.899
which they would normally you wouldn't

562.68 --> 566.2199999999999
normally communicate to somebody like

564.899 --> 568.8
that

566.22 --> 571.9200000000001
but it's like I kind of like do my thing

568.8 --> 575.459
but without having the normal responses

571.92 --> 576.899
then it's like I can I can just get

575.459 --> 579.899
through to people

576.899 --> 582.72
and then kind of see

579.899 --> 584.7
why I do it is because I see I I didn't

582.72 --> 587.76
get that look

584.7 --> 591.36
and from that look that response look I

587.76 --> 593.7
can get so much like

591.36 --> 596.7
information

593.7 --> 600.1800000000001
spiritual metadata and that is kind of

596.7 --> 602.399
then what I drew in my dreams it's weird

600.18 --> 606.0799999999999
it's like I'm further testing people

602.399 --> 606.08
simulating them

606.839 --> 612.6600000000001
and then having a range of control over

609.899 --> 616.26
them which I normally wouldn't

612.66 --> 619.1999999999999
but I only do it to not yeah to figure

616.26 --> 621.42
things out and think of things out about

619.2 --> 622.9200000000001
how they do things and what they really

621.42 --> 626.899
want

622.92 --> 626.899
because people hide that [ __ ]

629.1 --> 631.76
anyway

633.3 --> 637.399
but that was kind of fun in those dreams

637.8 --> 642.68
uh

640.2 --> 642.6800000000001
right

642.899 --> 647.0
what else

644.459 --> 647.0
foreign

657.36 --> 660.9590000000001
but he was like very on to another

659.64 --> 663.18
subject

660.959 --> 664.92
and man

663.18 --> 667.92
I'm real I'm almost getting a bit

664.92 --> 669.36
trollish because it's not just what he

667.92 --> 671.64
did with me

669.36 --> 674.339
saying arbitrary dude he calls

671.64 --> 676.38
everything arbitrary I'm like starting

674.339 --> 678.7790000000001
to wonder if he's kind of lost track of

676.38 --> 680.76
even like

678.779 --> 683.66
what that means

680.76 --> 683.66
sometimes

684.36 --> 689.279
it's weird

686.339 --> 691.9200000000001
but I'm I'm detecting like a slight

689.279 --> 694.68
aberration going on with Jim Bob

691.92 --> 697.1999999999999
it's like he's taking his Peak skills a

694.68 --> 699.54
bit too far or something

697.2 --> 701.339
because I wonder how many people can

699.54 --> 705.8
actually follow what he's talking about

701.339 --> 705.8000000000001
sometimes when he gets like that

705.899 --> 711.3
it's

707.279 --> 714.26
like philosophy esoterics but it's so

711.3 --> 714.26
many shortcuts

714.68 --> 720.12
and I often cannot follow just the

718.079 --> 721.9799999999999
connections of what he's trying to

720.12 --> 723.6
convey

721.98 --> 727.32
because of that

723.6 --> 729.66
and I wonder am I the only one

727.32 --> 732.0600000000001
because nobody ever like says like what

729.66 --> 735.4399999999999
do you mean Jim Bob like nobody ever

732.06 --> 735.4399999999999
says that in the chat

741.18 --> 747.56
no work today minus 20.

744.48 --> 747.5600000000001
damn that's cool

748.98 --> 751.7
all right

763.44 --> 767.12
oh man

767.22 --> 770.12
where's everybody

770.16 --> 774.6
I mean

771.779 --> 777.74
you're here that's cool and let's see

774.6 --> 777.74
where's everybody else

778.62 --> 781.639
hey what's this

782.519 --> 786.9590000000001
oh that Dutch guy is going live again

784.56 --> 788.5189999999999
this evening

786.959 --> 790.8
huh

788.519 --> 792.779
getting notifications for that a

790.8 --> 795.5
Premiere okay

792.779 --> 795.5
we'll see

796.68 --> 802.01
uh

798.77 --> 802.01
[Music]

811.339 --> 816.0600000000001
what else was I doing yeah mostly just

814.32 --> 816.98
watching Owen Benjamin been catching up

816.06 --> 820.179
on a lot of that

816.98 --> 820.179
[Music]

822.5 --> 825.659
[Music]

828.6 --> 832.9200000000001
also I've just been having some weird

830.76 --> 835.579
hey hello stasmaritz

832.92 --> 835.579
see you

836.22 --> 840.12
I've been having some weird

838.86 --> 842.279
it's

840.12 --> 844.019
like scary thoughts but it's kind of

842.279 --> 846.899
personal and it's

844.019 --> 850.32
well entangled with the vision

846.899 --> 853.579
but it's like worrying me

850.32 --> 853.5790000000001
that I might have like

853.62 --> 858.68
contracted something very scary

859.26 --> 863.399
like a long time ago but I'm not sure

861.839 --> 865.86
that's the whole [ __ ] up thing about

863.399 --> 870.98
it and

865.86 --> 870.98
whatever it is it only seems to like

871.019 --> 876.899
remind me of that in a very specific

874.62 --> 880.74
type of condition

876.899 --> 882.66
and I it's it's to me it's still too

880.74 --> 884.279
ethereal I like can't even pinpoint

882.66 --> 886.98
enough

884.279 --> 888.959
but sometimes I'm afraid there is like

886.98 --> 890.88
something inside of me

888.959 --> 894.0
and it's not like a ghost or something

890.88 --> 897.6
but like something I was like implanted

894.0 --> 899.339
and I'm not sure I'm not sure but I'm

897.6 --> 901.5
like sometimes I'm afraid that it's just

899.339 --> 904.1
like eating away at me

901.5 --> 904.1
foreign

907.5 --> 912.959
sometimes like there's just this weird

910.68 --> 916.3389999999999
tensions there

912.959 --> 916.3389999999999
and noises

916.62 --> 920.82
that's creepy

918.839 --> 924.1800000000001
because it sounds almost like something

920.82 --> 926.899
is literally eating away at my bones and

924.18 --> 930.06
that's a really [ __ ] scary thought

926.899 --> 931.5
but I don't know if that is if that is

930.06 --> 933.899
what it even

931.5 --> 937.38
seems

933.899 --> 940.68
it could also be well what is typically

937.38 --> 944.639
related to uh sinus infection where

940.68 --> 946.8
there's just pressures right often the

944.639 --> 949.139
sinus infection is really then it's

946.8 --> 952.3199999999999
something like a super Under Pressure

949.139 --> 954.24
but it's very typical it's super painful

952.32 --> 956.22
or annoying and

954.24 --> 958.8
but you know what that's like

956.22 --> 961.6800000000001
and then you expect weird things to

958.8 --> 965.0999999999999
happen but if that's not there

961.68 --> 967.26
but still the rest of the con that

965.1 --> 969.5400000000001
typical condition is there then it's

967.26 --> 970.26
just like what the [ __ ] is going on in

969.54 --> 974.3
there

970.26 --> 974.3
and it just freaks me out sometimes

975.18 --> 980.519
and then those ideas come to mind like

978.3 --> 983.88
is that some kind of a thing that's like

980.519 --> 988.339
waking up and then starting to eat at my

983.88 --> 988.3389999999999
bones it's a really scary thought

989.22 --> 992.22
and

994.44 --> 1000.6800000000001
well

997.079 --> 1004.04
maybe at some point I could like try to

1000.68 --> 1006.2589999999999
get more close inspection but if that's

1004.04 --> 1008.8389999999999
the weird thing man

1006.259 --> 1011.54
I did have it checked out in my vision

1008.839 --> 1014.24
and I got some

1011.54 --> 1016.7199999999999
feedback there that basically just said

1014.24 --> 1016.72
no

1016.759 --> 1021.86
so I even remember in my vision having

1019.579 --> 1023.8389999999999
that type of scare

1021.86 --> 1025.939
it's like another segment of my vision

1023.839 --> 1027.74
that I have there to compare with so

1025.939 --> 1030.439
yeah that doesn't really help but the

1027.74 --> 1033.38
thing is that the result of that was a

1030.439 --> 1036.14
no but still I'm it's like not even my

1033.38 --> 1038.66
vision is convincing me

1036.14 --> 1040.8390000000002
and that's kind of mystifying to think

1038.66 --> 1040.8390000000002
about

1041.78 --> 1045.98
right

1043.22 --> 1048.74
but what I do usually when that idea

1045.98 --> 1050.84
pops up is just let it go

1048.74 --> 1053.419
because what am I gonna do even if that

1050.84 --> 1056.36
is there like what am I gonna do

1053.419 --> 1058.4
what so medical intervention

1056.36 --> 1062.299
really

1058.4 --> 1064.7
how with like what what money and how

1062.299 --> 1066.62
can I even trust that to be done out

1064.7 --> 1069.4
there right now

1066.62 --> 1069.3999999999999
foreign

1069.88 --> 1077.3200000000002
happen whatever happens and make sure

1072.679 --> 1077.3200000000002
that I minimize damage anyway

1080.26 --> 1084.34
some weird stuff with me

1084.559 --> 1087.98
now once I actually got to sleep though

1086.539 --> 1090.14
like

1087.98 --> 1092.78
the dreams

1090.14 --> 1095.0800000000002
because I didn't my dreams were just

1092.78 --> 1095.08
fine

1096.919 --> 1101.0200000000002
which by the way is a good sign because

1098.9 --> 1106.039
usually when something's really wrong

1101.02 --> 1110.26
then I take that with me into the dream

1106.039 --> 1110.26
anyway hello Rich p

1111.02 --> 1114.76
how about that set Loom

1119.9 --> 1126.26
there was something about that right I

1122.36 --> 1129.1
saw a video from Level Earth Observer

1126.26 --> 1129.1
in my feed

1130.64 --> 1138.5200000000002
Chinese spy balloon pops the narrative

1135.26 --> 1138.52
is that what you're talking about

1140.66 --> 1146.72
I mean it's known that satelloons are

1144.5 --> 1149.72
being used

1146.72 --> 1151.34
in modern day there's like film footage

1149.72 --> 1153.5
of that

1151.34 --> 1155.059
is this Australian footage of an

1153.5 --> 1158.62
accident that happened

1155.059 --> 1158.62
with this afternoon launch

1160.7 --> 1164.67
so yeah those things are being used

1162.799 --> 1173.849
definitely

1164.67 --> 1173.8490000000002
[Music]

1174.38 --> 1179.8400000000001
yeah exactly that's what I thought

1177.2 --> 1182.14
the Chinese spy thing yeah it's a

1179.84 --> 1182.1399999999999
balloon

1182.179 --> 1186.8200000000002
it's a balloon with a satellite hanging

1184.46 --> 1186.82
off it

1191.84 --> 1193.9599999999998
um

1205.65 --> 1210.3490000000002
[Music]

1210.799 --> 1213.799
laughs

1226.96 --> 1232.52
the U.S probably does the same in China

1230.059 --> 1235.1
no I don't think that the U.S

1232.52 --> 1237.5
has set balloons hovering over oh maybe

1235.1 --> 1239.7199999999998
they do

1237.5 --> 1242.12
right but I don't even know if like

1239.72 --> 1245.679
satelloons are like a real primary

1242.12 --> 1245.6789999999999
source of information for them

1247.76 --> 1252.5
I mean

1249.5 --> 1254.9
if it's all Tower based and maybe they

1252.5 --> 1258.94
even have techniques to

1254.9 --> 1258.94
basically look around the corner

1260.12 --> 1264.26
right I'm just I was just thinking about

1262.28 --> 1267.5
that in my mind

1264.26 --> 1270.4
like maybe this sounds weird though it's

1267.5 --> 1273.08
definitely not a regular visual type

1270.4 --> 1276.26
observation but maybe they have

1273.08 --> 1279.32
ways to literally well as they say

1276.26 --> 1283.64
Bounce It Off the stratosphere

1279.32 --> 1286.76
but maybe they have a way to bounce

1283.64 --> 1290.1200000000001
it off the firmament or the flat top I

1286.76 --> 1293.6
mean especially if it's a flat top

1290.12 --> 1295.58
that would be really easy you send the

1293.6 --> 1297.74
signal up it's literally gonna reflect

1295.58 --> 1300.799
and then you can literally use it like a

1297.74 --> 1302.6
mirror and basically scan things at the

1300.799 --> 1305.36
ground level

1302.6 --> 1307.52
right but you'd always be dependent on

1305.36 --> 1310.34
the angles you can make and so there

1307.52 --> 1314.24
would be spots that you couldn't see

1310.34 --> 1316.1
but you could see a bit from the top and

1314.24 --> 1317.419
a lot of places as far as your range

1316.1 --> 1319.4599999999998
goes

1317.419 --> 1322.1000000000001
if that were the case

1319.46 --> 1324.26
but set loons yeah they would give that

1322.1 --> 1326.78
opportunity to actually look in those

1324.26 --> 1330.1
little spots you can't reach

1326.78 --> 1330.1
so that could be a reason

1330.98 --> 1335.6
because otherwise if they can't do that

1333.919 --> 1339.46
yeah then there would have to be set

1335.6 --> 1339.4599999999998
balloons pretty much everywhere

1344.78 --> 1349.4189999999999
or in a lot of places

1358.039 --> 1364.28
every country spies on other countries

1360.919 --> 1365.72
you think yeah but they even have deals

1364.28 --> 1370.1589999999999
with that

1365.72 --> 1373.28
right because it's like a Lego loophole

1370.159 --> 1376.88
right a lot of spy agencies

1373.28 --> 1378.2
they're not allowed to spy on their own

1376.88 --> 1380.7800000000002
but

1378.2 --> 1382.64
yeah other countries will still do that

1380.78 --> 1385.34
nonetheless because they have no

1382.64 --> 1387.3200000000002
objections spying on the foreign country

1385.34 --> 1391.299
but then the intelligence agencies

1387.32 --> 1391.299
simply exchange intelligence

1392.059 --> 1396.799
they just get that data from the other

1394.94 --> 1398.419
agency

1396.799 --> 1401.12
secretly

1398.419 --> 1403.159
it's but that's not legal but they still

1401.12 --> 1405.6789999999999
just do that

1403.159 --> 1408.74
keep it to themselves

1405.679 --> 1411.38
so yeah I mean every country spying on

1408.74 --> 1413.78
every other country

1411.38 --> 1416.24
and even the countries themselves get

1413.78 --> 1418.94
benefit will benefit the government of

1416.24 --> 1420.799
them from being spied upon

1418.94 --> 1424.1200000000001
by others

1420.799 --> 1424.12
they trade that information

1434.38 --> 1440.74
right anyway

1438.02 --> 1440.74
foreign

1471.74 --> 1476.419
foreign

1473.419 --> 1476.419
so

1477.32 --> 1480.28
is that it

1480.32 --> 1484.34
set Looms

1482.0 --> 1485.99
I mean yeah there's only so long I can

1484.34 --> 1489.069
talk about that

1485.99 --> 1489.069
[Music]

1497.659 --> 1504.679
I'm surprised there's no Ballers yeah

1501.039 --> 1508.6
yeah satellites they're floating in

1504.679 --> 1508.6000000000001
orbit around the Earth

1510.919 --> 1513.5200000000002
huh

1515.48 --> 1519.039
maybe they all fell asleep

1519.559 --> 1525.1589999999999
there's 20 watching though

1522.38 --> 1525.159
it's kind of nice

1527.179 --> 1532.0590000000002
hope you're all enjoying the show

1529.46 --> 1535.88
so far about satelloons and me having

1532.059 --> 1538.48
weird dreams and

1535.88 --> 1538.48
all that

1538.52 --> 1544.059
driving to work

1541.4 --> 1544.0590000000002
all right

1559.01 --> 1562.039
[Music]

1563.179 --> 1566.74
yeah you have a great weekend too

1570.2 --> 1575.8400000000001
the balloon is atmospheric that makes no

1573.14 --> 1578.8400000000001
sense for HP

1575.84 --> 1578.84
foreign

1579.08 --> 1584.3799999999999
why would it be atmospheric lensing what

1601.76 --> 1605.419
what why

1605.539 --> 1609.08
and what what do you mean let's do why

1607.46 --> 1612.3400000000001
would it be a good thing to paint those

1609.08 --> 1612.34
things black at the bottom

1614.419 --> 1617.2
foreign

1631.15 --> 1635.9
[Music]

1633.86 --> 1637.6999999999998
it's that weird type of rain that you

1635.9 --> 1641.0
just can't see

1637.7 --> 1642.32
it's just almost raining I don't know it

1641.0 --> 1645.74
does seem like things are getting wet

1642.32 --> 1645.74
out there weird

1650.04 --> 1653.299
[Music]

1658.46 --> 1661.1200000000001
foreign

1683.059 --> 1687.98
I don't get it what do you mean what are

1685.64 --> 1691.779
you talking about it's just

1687.98 --> 1691.779
don't understand what you just said

1699.919 --> 1704.24
maybe you type that in the middle of

1702.08 --> 1707.86
like doing something

1704.24 --> 1707.86
probably oh well

1708.62 --> 1710.799
foreign

1727.279 --> 1732.86
oh right uh yeah I got a

1731.059 --> 1736.039
email

1732.86 --> 1738.279
oh wait I did talk about that right

1736.039 --> 1741.62
about

1738.279 --> 1745.52
gen basically sent me an email

1741.62 --> 1748.34
with the video that is like elaborately

1745.52 --> 1752.179
explaining why the Devil's Tower is not

1748.34 --> 1755.84
a tree but actually the foot

1752.179 --> 1758.02
it's like very specific bone structures

1755.84 --> 1761.059
or like muscle fiber structures

1758.02 --> 1762.679
according to that person was getting

1761.059 --> 1765.799
very detailed with it I wasn't

1762.679 --> 1770.779
completely sure about it well there's

1765.799 --> 1770.779
definitely a very interesting idea

1771.08 --> 1773.9189999999999
foreign

1774.7 --> 1780.5800000000002
scale wise I mean if that thing is just

1777.559 --> 1780.58
a foot then

1780.62 --> 1786.6999999999998
that giant would have been

1783.22 --> 1786.7
unbelievably large

1788.84 --> 1793.399
and just yeah puts a whole new

1791.72 --> 1795.44
perspective to it I mean it's much

1793.399 --> 1797.3799999999999
easier to imagine giant trees than

1795.44 --> 1801.2
literal people

1797.38 --> 1803.659
humanoids being that freaking huge

1801.2 --> 1806.299
huh

1803.659 --> 1808.779
but yeah it's it's interesting I thought

1806.299 --> 1808.779
at least

1816.679 --> 1824.3200000000002
that came out yeah I know

1820.399 --> 1828.62
did NASA create the blackout paint

1824.32 --> 1831.82
did they I don't know what paint

1828.62 --> 1831.82
are they using that

1849.919 --> 1855.94
not being polished with it okay I got it

1852.5 --> 1855.94
rich B it's just that

1857.059 --> 1862.1
it doesn't re like atmospheric lensing

1860.299 --> 1866.0
would be oh why it is in a different

1862.1 --> 1869.0
location as it's supposed to be to prove

1866.0 --> 1871.279
the curve right that's where atmospheric

1869.0 --> 1873.2
lensing or like an angular size of a

1871.279 --> 1875.659
Celestial body would come into play as

1873.2 --> 1877.94
an argument from a baller but I mean if

1875.659 --> 1879.679
it's a balloon like there it is it's a

1877.94 --> 1881.96
balloon you can see it like atmospheric

1879.679 --> 1884.24
lensing that has no relation

1881.96 --> 1886.3400000000001
to any response about that

1884.24 --> 1887.659
I mean a baller would probably more

1886.34 --> 1889.8799999999999
typically say

1887.659 --> 1892.0390000000002
or an anti-flat earther I guess an

1889.88 --> 1894.279
Enthusiast like no they all have those

1892.039 --> 1894.279
too

1896.12 --> 1901.1589999999999
it's just they're still satellite but

1898.7 --> 1905.0800000000002
there's also set Looms

1901.159 --> 1905.0800000000002
they use them for different things

1905.36 --> 1908.84
right

1906.86 --> 1911.1789999999999
for more read you know because it's

1908.84 --> 1913.279
closer to the ground in that sort of

1911.179 --> 1915.3200000000002
sense

1913.279 --> 1917.6
that's what a baller would use as an

1915.32 --> 1920.2
excuse so I didn't really recognize the

1917.6 --> 1920.1999999999998
connection there

1920.63 --> 1923.669
[Music]

1928.7 --> 1932.32
it doesn't reflect like

1933.62 --> 1937.1789999999999
okay LSG but

1937.7 --> 1941.24
would that actually make it invisible

1940.159 --> 1944.179
then

1941.24 --> 1945.919
or would it just make it stand out like

1944.179 --> 1949.46
a big black dot

1945.919 --> 1951.5590000000002
in the sky during the day

1949.46 --> 1952.82
I mean at night for sure you wouldn't

1951.559 --> 1957.94
see it

1952.82 --> 1957.9399999999998
unless it passes in front of a star

1958.399 --> 1963.86
and you have a high enough resolution

1960.679 --> 1968.0800000000002
for your Zoom whatever you're looking at

1963.86 --> 1968.08
right through so

1968.779 --> 1974.26
but during the daytime you would see

1970.76 --> 1974.26
just this black dot

1974.48 --> 1978.7
surrounded by Blue I had imagined

1989.299 --> 1995.059
but I mean like it could be very

1991.7 --> 1999.919
functional for like aircraft

1995.059 --> 2003.299
that like for stealthy Knight aircraft

1999.919 --> 2003.2990000000002
for night flights

2015.94 --> 2020.6200000000001
I don't even understand why there isn't

2018.039 --> 2022.6589999999999
even like stealthy like

2020.62 --> 2025.9599999999998
actual

2022.659 --> 2027.94
more local stealthy craft

2025.96 --> 2029.08
that you just like can't that would

2027.94 --> 2031.72
adapt

2029.08 --> 2035.799
the color

2031.72 --> 2038.14
to the general color of the background

2035.799 --> 2042.039
right it doesn't even have to be like a

2038.14 --> 2045.3400000000001
full Predator style cloaking thing but

2042.039 --> 2046.84
just to adapt a color so that when you

2045.34 --> 2048.52
look at it it's and there's a blue

2046.84 --> 2050.139
background it's going to be looking blue

2048.52 --> 2051.339
and there's clouds it's going to be

2050.139 --> 2054.7200000000003
looking white

2051.339 --> 2054.72
right I mean

2055.72 --> 2061.48
I think that could probably be done

2058.48 --> 2063.899
that would make a very effective stealth

2061.48 --> 2063.899
mechanism

2065.2 --> 2068.2
foreign

2072.04 --> 2078.7
or you could even just keep it basic and

2076.599 --> 2080.619
not like have an actual holographic

2078.7 --> 2083.2
element like with basically rotating

2080.619 --> 2085.359
crystals right that's how you do it so

2083.2 --> 2087.339
that it has a holographic color effect

2085.359 --> 2088.7799999999997
like you look at it from this way you

2087.339 --> 2090.339
get to see this color you look at it

2088.78 --> 2092.8590000000004
from that way you get to see that color

2090.339 --> 2095.56
because that is what is behind it

2092.859 --> 2097.54
would have to figure that out

2095.56 --> 2099.2799999999997
I think it's very similar to like the

2097.54 --> 2100.42
stealth blading they would use for some

2099.28 --> 2102.76
tanks

2100.42 --> 2104.56
that I've seen demonstrations of it

2102.76 --> 2107.5200000000004
would be that kind of effect you could

2104.56 --> 2107.52
do that on a plane

2113.64 --> 2118.54
okay now maybe I shouldn't be talking

2116.5 --> 2121.96
about maybe these are like way too good

2118.54 --> 2124.06
ideas or probably they're already there

2121.96 --> 2126.7
I mean I bet that the newest stealth

2124.06 --> 2128.32
fighter bombers have that sort of thing

2126.7 --> 2130.2999999999997
that you just wouldn't be able to see

2128.32 --> 2133.7400000000002
and not just by radar but even visually

2130.3 --> 2133.7400000000002
you just wouldn't be able to see them

2136.48 --> 2138.96
anyway

2162.28 --> 2167.92
all right but you see like if you just

2165.579 --> 2169.7200000000003
have uh I'm gonna keep talking about it

2167.92 --> 2172.2000000000003
anyway because it's not a lot of other

2169.72 --> 2172.2
input

2173.579 --> 2179.44
but stealthy like visually stealthy uh

2177.28 --> 2182.92
mechanisms for aircraft would

2179.44 --> 2185.92
technically be easier

2182.92 --> 2188.94
than for vehicles on the ground because

2185.92 --> 2191.8
the ground is visually more complicated

2188.94 --> 2195.16
on average like even if it's just a

2191.8 --> 2197.6800000000003
desert or a Rocky Mountain then still

2195.16 --> 2202.5989999999997
there's a lot of things close up

2197.68 --> 2204.94
and protrusions and all kinds of things

2202.599 --> 2207.82
different types of colors that's come

2204.94 --> 2210.94
more complicated to adapt to then well

2207.82 --> 2213.579
the sky which typically looks

2210.94 --> 2215.619
very uniform

2213.579 --> 2217.6600000000003
right so you wouldn't necessarily even

2215.619 --> 2219.2200000000003
have you could just have a standard

2217.66 --> 2221.56
color shift

2219.22 --> 2224.2
and it's just one color and that color

2221.56 --> 2226.119
can shift depending on the readings of

2224.2 --> 2227.859
the general visual conditions out there

2226.119 --> 2229.78
it's like oh it's a blue sky okay so

2227.859 --> 2232.119
we're going to adapt to that blue then

2229.78 --> 2233.92
oh it's typically clouded white or white

2232.119 --> 2235.119
grayish okay we're gonna then be white

2233.92 --> 2238.9
grayish

2235.119 --> 2240.76
like that the plane could simply just

2238.9 --> 2244.2000000000003
shift color it wouldn't even have to be

2240.76 --> 2244.2000000000003
like Prismatic in any way

2246.579 --> 2251.4
that's shouldn't be that difficult

2253.21 --> 2256.409
[Music]

2261.82 --> 2269.099
light bending fabric surface no

2266.079 --> 2269.099
not like that

2269.859 --> 2275.92
it wouldn't actually like show you

2272.74 --> 2278.9799999999996
things through it that are behind it not

2275.92 --> 2281.98
like that not an actual

2278.98 --> 2284.76
full transparent stealth system like the

2281.98 --> 2284.76
Predator cloak

2284.92 --> 2288.4
that's not what I'm talking about that

2286.66 --> 2290.92
would make it way too complicated you

2288.4 --> 2293.14
wouldn't even need that just have a

2290.92 --> 2296.64
standard color adaptation so it's very

2293.14 --> 2299.14
hard to spot and hey it's a an aircraft

2296.64 --> 2302.0789999999997
they go fast

2299.14 --> 2303.46
they are already kind of tiny usually in

2302.079 --> 2305.5600000000004
the background and if they then

2303.46 --> 2307.7200000000003
literally blend in perfectly with the

2305.56 --> 2309.7
color of the background you will not be

2307.72 --> 2311.4399999999996
able to visually spot them or it'll take

2309.7 --> 2313.4199999999996
you a very long time and then oh guess

2311.44 --> 2315.52
what got you in the Target bang you're

2313.42 --> 2317.619
down

2315.52 --> 2320.82
right I mean it could be a real

2317.619 --> 2320.82
advantage in this guy

2322.42 --> 2327.579
unless everything is just fully

2324.82 --> 2329.6800000000003
robotized and I mean drones that just go

2327.579 --> 2330.82
by scans well if you can deflect that

2329.68 --> 2332.98
then

2330.82 --> 2335.8
it's just that if there is any kind of

2332.98 --> 2337.9
necessity of visual

2335.8 --> 2341.5600000000004
recognition

2337.9 --> 2345.06
in combat in air combat then it could be

2341.56 --> 2345.06
a real advantage to have that

2346.06 --> 2350.92
but if you're just purely going by

2348.4 --> 2352.839
automated aiming scanning systems and

2350.92 --> 2355.079
all that then it wouldn't be much of a

2352.839 --> 2355.0789999999997
difference

2372.7 --> 2379.54
but I don't know maybe for like

2376.3 --> 2381.76
a balloon coating for a SAT balloon it

2379.54 --> 2384.579
could work it would certainly help hide

2381.76 --> 2386.6800000000003
that giant balloon

2384.579 --> 2390.48
from what I've seen there are usually

2386.68 --> 2390.48
white cloth of some kind

2395.14 --> 2399.7
but yeah why would you do that and I

2397.359 --> 2401.68
mean

2399.7 --> 2405.18
I need something else to talk about this

2401.68 --> 2405.18
is getting going nowhere

2429.48 --> 2433.38
and

2431.38 --> 2433.38
then

2449.26 --> 2452.94
oh right there's another thing

2453.76 --> 2461.44
yeah I'm gonna try to or well I I

2458.02 --> 2463.8
basically contacted Adam

2461.44 --> 2467.619
on maybe getting some

2463.8 --> 2469.9
emoticons for the membership system

2467.619 --> 2472.78
like of course in the Illuminati Castle

2469.9 --> 2475.8
but there's many more little things

2472.78 --> 2475.8
and so

2476.92 --> 2483.4
I'm thinking of emoticons

2480.22 --> 2485.98
like a list I mean I don't want like a

2483.4 --> 2490.3
hundred of them or anything but I mean

2485.98 --> 2492.16
we could do a whole range of emoticons

2490.3 --> 2496.3
I can figure it out I've been thinking

2492.16 --> 2499.6189999999997
about like a relative density emoticon

2496.3 --> 2499.619
and like

2502.24 --> 2506.3799999999997
yeah this is mostly it

2505.18 --> 2510.0989999999997
right

2506.38 --> 2513.339
these are the roughly the ideas of it

2510.099 --> 2516.1600000000003
to have it like that and probably the

2513.339 --> 2519.339
box it's just an RD dot in the middle

2516.16 --> 2521.68
and arrows up and down

2519.339 --> 2525.0
that's a symbol for relative density I

2521.68 --> 2525.0
don't know I've been thinking about that

2525.339 --> 2529.74
foreign

2526.359 --> 2529.74
could go in any direction

2532.24 --> 2537.54
right and I want a Rogan's thumb

2534.22 --> 2541.9599999999996
literally like a photograph of a thumb

2537.54 --> 2546.06
with like a face drawn on it

2541.96 --> 2546.06
that will be a Rogan's emoticon

2553.18 --> 2558.22
and of course the Illuminati Castle

2556.06 --> 2560.94
oh yeah turmeric coffee even though I

2558.22 --> 2560.9399999999996
don't drink that anymore

2561.76 --> 2566.92
so I got four

2564.64 --> 2569.2599999999998
any ideas

2566.92 --> 2572.7400000000002
that are act yeah it would have to be

2569.26 --> 2574.3
like really about my show or me

2572.74 --> 2577.6189999999997
or something

2574.3 --> 2577.619
that I typically do

2578.14 --> 2583.72
if you can figure something out

2581.319 --> 2587.579
Rogan's it up forever funny yeah it will

2583.72 --> 2590.68
be even more funny if there is an actual

2587.579 --> 2593.4
emoticon of a thumb with a face on it

2590.68 --> 2593.3999999999996
I mean

2593.619 --> 2598.119
you gotta do that I want to do that so

2596.5 --> 2600.48
that's one that's definitely going to be

2598.119 --> 2600.48
in there

2606.72 --> 2612.4599999999996
the necklace

2610.18 --> 2616.44
Flower of Life yeah maybe

2612.46 --> 2616.44
hello dank good to see you

2626.2 --> 2631.18
maybe I do array join in there too and a

2628.96 --> 2632.619
ball win

foreign

2632.619 --> 2635.88
something like that

2636.88 --> 2643.2400000000002
but it it kind of like it's not just oh

2639.76 --> 2645.76
the word oh yes no it has to actually be

2643.24 --> 2649.8999999999996
visually logical

2645.76 --> 2652.0600000000004
you have to get it otherwise it's just

2649.9 --> 2654.819
stuff that people will be like what the

2652.06 --> 2657.2999999999997
hell is even that

2654.819 --> 2657.3
right

2660.28 --> 2667.5
it has to make some kind of sense

2663.599 --> 2667.5
hey Bluefield evolution

2672.46 --> 2676.2
I think the Spy balloon was very high

2676.599 --> 2680.5
right well maybe

2679.42 --> 2683.099
yeah

2680.5 --> 2686.5
it's not that high or maybe it just

2683.099 --> 2689.38
winged spoons

2686.5 --> 2691.3
oh Angel spoons

2689.38 --> 2694.079
that's a funny one yeah that's that's

right even then thinking about like

2734.74 --> 2741.04
rectangular looping but I mean

2738.4 --> 2744.4
it's probably then just gonna be well

2741.04 --> 2748.48
the typical picture that I used that I

2744.4 --> 2751.6600000000003
use for like the thumbnail right

2748.48 --> 2753.88
the rectangular at a side view with the

2751.66 --> 2756.22
celestial sphere behind it I mean I

2753.88 --> 2758.02
can't make a basic a very small emoticon

2768.579 --> 2773.5600000000004

2771.52 --> 2775.599
I could use some help

2773.56 --> 2778.2999999999997

2775.599 --> 2779.8

2778.3 --> 2784.079
anything you're gonna say I'm gonna

2779.8 --> 2784.079
immediately be like yeah but

2847.9 --> 2851.04

2858.339 --> 2863.2799999999997
you can't use it outside of the show

2863.859 --> 2867.5989999999997
I guess I could do it

2876.64 --> 2880.74
all right that's okay

2884.74 --> 2891.18

that's a pretty good one

LSG LSG just

2921.76 --> 2926.079
give me an idea about a symbol for

relative density is basically two

2926.079 --> 2933.119
droplets in different directions

2928.9 --> 2933.119
that is that would also work but

2937.38 --> 2942.01
I mean still you'd have to know what

2941.02 --> 2945.269
that is then

no that doesn't exist yeah suck puppy

puppet

3134.81 --> 3138.0099999999998
[Music]

3141.9 --> 3148.099
right so anyway I'm taking the notes and

3144.66 --> 3148.0989999999997
we'll see what I'll keep

3158.76 --> 3163.0400000000004
a troll in socks

3163.26 --> 3167.5200000000004
yeah but it can't get an entire troll it

3166.559 --> 3170.3390000000004
would be

3167.52 --> 3172.079
it has to fit in an emoticon so if I'm

3170.339 --> 3174.2
gonna do a troll it's just gonna be its

3172.079 --> 3174.2000000000003
head

3177.18 --> 3181.9199999999996
and a sock puppet you can literally just

3179.94 --> 3183.7200000000003
like the human thumb right with the

3181.92 --> 3186.78
smiley face you can literally have a

3183.72 --> 3189.4199999999996
sock with eyes the same thing but with a

3186.78 --> 3191.88
hand a picture because those things are

3189.42 --> 3194.099
recognizable

3191.88 --> 3196.5
I mean if it's gonna be like this

3194.099 --> 3198.7200000000003
incredibly elaborate detailed thing you

3196.5 --> 3201.24
can't fit that all in an emoticon it's

3198.72 --> 3204.0789999999997
just that's not it'll just be

3201.24 --> 3204.0789999999997
unrecognizable

3211.44 --> 3217.619
but if it's relatively simple then you

3213.9 --> 3220.319
can even make a real life photo

3217.619 --> 3221.94
and those are even funnier than if it's

3220.319 --> 3225.319
just drawn

3221.94 --> 3225.319
pixel by pixel

3228.75 --> 3232.92
[Music]

3230.579 --> 3235.46
what

3232.92 --> 3235.46
is that

3241.5 --> 3244.339
okay

3245.099 --> 3248.099
weird

3256.68 --> 3260.1189999999997
that's really weird

3261.74 --> 3269.04
looks harmless enough I guess

3264.72 --> 3272.8799999999997
weird though so you can start water

3269.04 --> 3274.44
want you want a new logo no not

3272.88 --> 3277.46
necessarily

3274.44 --> 3277.46
my logo is fine

3282.839 --> 3289.16
no turret I'm working on emoticons for

3286.26 --> 3289.1600000000003
the membership system

3293.22 --> 3300.24
I'm just gonna try to even though it's

3296.42 --> 3303.079
1500 episodes later I'm gonna try to do

3300.24 --> 3305.52
something about that

3303.079 --> 3307.38
very very

3305.52 --> 3310.94
late

3307.38 --> 3310.94
typical Armenian Style

3310.98 --> 3316.68
well yeah better late than never and

3314.28 --> 3320.1600000000003
I didn't want to just it's like oh

3316.68 --> 3322.7999999999997
quickly insert as much stuff

3320.16 --> 3324.48
right now I've had like a lot of time to

3322.8 --> 3326.9
think about it I'm in a better place

3324.48 --> 3326.9
myself

3328.859 --> 3331.339
right

3331.68 --> 3336.4199999999996
I have a slightly different attitude I

3334.26 --> 3338.2200000000003
mean if I done this like as soon as I

3336.42 --> 3341.46
got monetized I would have been much

3338.22 --> 3344.91
more aggressive with the emoticons

3341.46 --> 3348.0
now I can just be more subtle about it

3344.91 --> 3348.0
[Music]

3348.66 --> 3353.16
because I don't really want to go back

3350.46 --> 3355.2
to just bickering and back and forth

3353.16 --> 3358.94
thing like that I'm actually trying to

3355.2 --> 3358.9399999999996
maneuver away from that more and more

3359.16 --> 3362.72
I want my anger under control

3363.54 --> 3368.18
it'll still be there but I just want it

3365.76 --> 3368.1800000000003
under control

3370.26 --> 3375.78
in a way I'm going to attempt to fuse

3372.48 --> 3378.359
Ray twin with my regular self in a way

3375.78 --> 3380.9
that he's not separated anymore he's

3378.359 --> 3380.9
integrated

3386.16 --> 3391.92
because in a way that form of

3388.579 --> 3395.1800000000003
compartmentalization that I have been

3391.92 --> 3398.52
doing with it it works very well for me

3395.18 --> 3402.96
but on the long run

3398.52 --> 3405.38
it is not healthy to compartmentalize

3402.96 --> 3405.38
all that

3408.359 --> 3413.46
then again it's better than completely

3411.0 --> 3416.04
suppressing it entirely which is sort of

3413.46 --> 3418.52
what I was doing before that so one step

3416.04 --> 3418.52
at a time

3418.92 --> 3423.089
ah

3420.03 --> 3423.0890000000004
[Music]

3427.14 --> 3431.22
right but there's also oh let's get

3429.54 --> 3432.839
psychological about our win again

3431.22 --> 3435.54
because that's what you want to hear

3432.839 --> 3437.22
well maybe you do I don't know

3435.54 --> 3438.37
it's important for me to figure it out

3437.22 --> 3441.18
though but

3438.37 --> 3444.7799999999997
[Music]

3441.18 --> 3448.859
the weird thing I had with rage

3444.78 --> 3453.2400000000002
is that when I'm not enraged

3448.859 --> 3455.22
it's like anger doesn't exist and I

3453.24 --> 3457.5589999999997
don't think about it and I don't

3455.22 --> 3459.24
consider it

3457.559 --> 3461.6400000000003
and that was always kind of an issue is

3459.24 --> 3463.74
that I was just like not getting angry

3461.64 --> 3464.94
and just like trying to enjoy things and

3463.74 --> 3467.339
then

3464.94 --> 3469.26
I just couldn't imagine that there even

3467.339 --> 3473.46
would be such a thing as anger until

3469.26 --> 3475.619
something just went completely wrong

3473.46 --> 3477.66
no and then her age when happens and

3475.619 --> 3479.579
then it's like entirely different the

3477.66 --> 3482.52
entire world just flips inside out and

3479.579 --> 3485.4
that entire way of thinking is like

3482.52 --> 3486.18
turned around 180 degrees and now I'm

3485.4 --> 3489.059
like

3486.18 --> 3493.0789999999997
no there's everything is wrong

3489.059 --> 3494.7000000000003
and something has to be done about it

3493.079 --> 3498.3
to change it

3494.7 --> 3501.24
potentially with dominance

3498.3 --> 3502.98
but it's so different

3501.24 --> 3505.5789999999997
it's such a different form of

3502.98 --> 3505.579
consciousness

3505.859 --> 3510.24
and I've even mentioned that but talking

3508.44 --> 3512.54
about that when it was still kind of

3510.24 --> 3512.54
happening

3514.8 --> 3520.3390000000004
but

3516.66 --> 3522.5989999999997
I'm trying to basically

3520.339 --> 3525.0789999999997
compartmentalize it less and just

3522.599 --> 3525.079
realize

3527.88 --> 3532.92
that that thing is there even though

3530.76 --> 3533.94
it's not up front in my Consciousness as

3532.92 --> 3537.299
much

3533.94 --> 3539.099
and that it is a part of me so that I

3537.299 --> 3545.22
just

3539.099 --> 3545.2200000000003
don't get lost in idyllic views

3549.599 --> 3555.02
but actually get a more tangible

3552.359 --> 3555.02
oversight

3555.059 --> 3559.3190000000004
because that's kind of it's the

3557.16 --> 3560.5789999999997
dreamer's effect right a dreamer they

3559.319 --> 3562.319
dream about something and then they

3560.579 --> 3565.02
forget about everything else well I

3562.319 --> 3567.24
typically have that thing

3565.02 --> 3569.7599999999998
yet absorbed by the moment and then

3567.24 --> 3574.04
everything organizes the way I think

3569.76 --> 3574.0400000000004
organizes surrounding that moment

3574.68 --> 3580.02
whatever is involved anyway

3577.26 --> 3582.42
[Music]

3580.02 --> 3585.42
what are you talking about

3582.42 --> 3585.42
evolution

3598.2 --> 3602.1189999999997
all right yeah okay so that's right

3603.42 --> 3608.579
dude if I could customize like

3606.54 --> 3610.5
the sticker thing

3608.579 --> 3612.7400000000002
well I don't have super chats active

3610.5 --> 3612.74
anymore

3615.18 --> 3619.7599999999998
but maybe those can be yeah I don't want

3618.0 --> 3623.78
to reactivate them anyway

3619.76 --> 3626.8190000000004
but I wonder if you could also

3623.78 --> 3631.6400000000003
modify those that you can have your own

3626.819 --> 3631.64
custom-made sticker thingy animations

3631.859 --> 3635.64
that you can have people pick from that

3634.2 --> 3637.2599999999998
would be interesting if you could have

3635.64 --> 3638.8799999999997
them customized I don't know if that's

3637.26 --> 3641.8190000000004
possible

3638.88 --> 3645.1400000000003
right but I'm just gonna go with the

3641.819 --> 3645.14
emoticons first

3657.92 --> 3660.92
foreign

3663.02 --> 3668.7599999999998
and sometimes I just

3665.819 --> 3670.98
it's kind of funny because sometimes

3668.76 --> 3675.8390000000004
they come popping up trying to be like

3670.98 --> 3678.0
hey you stupid aren't we news whatever

3675.839 --> 3680.099
when I'm actually kind of desperate to

3678.0 --> 3682.079
start talking about something

3680.099 --> 3684.119
and then they just say something stupid

3682.079 --> 3686.76
and then everybody in chat might be like

3684.119 --> 3688.44
oh it's stupid troll bolt art or

3686.76 --> 3689.94
something while I'm just like literally

3688.44 --> 3692.4
answering and now I have something to

3689.94 --> 3695.839
talk about for 10 minutes

3692.4 --> 3695.839
in a constructive way

3696.119 --> 3701.819
and I kind of actually like that

3699.359 --> 3703.74
today it's been completely troll free so

3701.819 --> 3706.319
far unless you want to count akumu virus

3703.74 --> 3709.8799999999997
as a troll but I mean

3706.319 --> 3709.88
he's domesticated troll

3715.38 --> 3720.26
you're a domesticated throw Aries well

3717.54 --> 3720.2599999999998
no not really

3720.92 --> 3727.4
you're not really a troll there is 106

3724.559 --> 3727.4
you're not the type

foreign

3735.18 --> 3738.98
[Music]

3740.96 --> 3746.16
I should probably have an emoticon for

3744.42 --> 3749.16
that too and then have the troll face

3746.16 --> 3751.5589999999997
the regular troll looking

3749.16 --> 3755.339
and then the domesticated troll where

3751.559 --> 3757.38
the troll looks all tidy and neat

3755.339 --> 3758.46
I don't know it has like a hat on or

3757.38 --> 3760.859
something

3758.46 --> 3763.38
like the same troll but then all

3760.859 --> 3766.7
civilized

3763.38 --> 3766.7000000000003
that would be kind of funny

3785.12 --> 3790.799
[Music]

3788.16 --> 3793.2
right but it's really the difficult part

3790.799 --> 3797.4
is to

3793.2 --> 3799.5589999999997
have it make sense it it has to be every

3797.4 --> 3802.2000000000003
time I make one of these it you have to

3799.559 --> 3805.02
see it and it has to be understood that

3802.2 --> 3807.4199999999996
is if it's not immediately understood if

3805.02 --> 3810.5
it's just like what is this you have to

3807.42 --> 3810.5
get it when you see it

3811.44 --> 3816.0
but anyway it's probably mostly going to

3814.14 --> 3818.94
be Adam working on that although I'll

3816.0 --> 3822.059
give him very precise instructions on

3818.94 --> 3824.28
what I kind of want it to look like

3822.059 --> 3824.5800000000004

3824.28 --> 3827.78
of thing

3865.14 --> 3867.74
after that

3878.839 --> 3883.2799999999997
Angel spoons are a very good one

3885.68 --> 3891.0589999999997
what other things

3888.42 --> 3892.98
I wish you could do an Armenian Paradox

3891.059 --> 3894.96
or something but

3892.98 --> 3897.54
you can't just

3894.96 --> 3898.44
do that into a symbol and have it make

3897.54 --> 3903.38
sense

3898.44 --> 3903.38
to have it in text it's not gonna fit

3914.46 --> 3919.05
hmm

3915.72 --> 3919.0499999999997
[Music]

3921.839 --> 3927.66
I'd love a symbol or a lemoticon symbol

3924.78 --> 3929.76
for the wave through but yeah that's if

3927.66 --> 3932.3999999999996
it's just a still stand image it's gonna

3929.76 --> 3935.119
look like prayer or something

3932.4 --> 3935.119
but

3940.74 --> 3946.52
yeah I mean not everything is maybe

3943.2 --> 3946.52
possible to do

3956.27 --> 3958.64
[Music]

3956.64 --> 3958.64
um

3960.54 --> 3965.7599999999998
I've always been trying to hello Cleary

3963.18 --> 3968.0
happy Friday been trying to think of

3965.76 --> 3968.0
like

3968.099 --> 3973.38
the holographic Sun

3971.52 --> 3976.859
but

3973.38 --> 3978.42
like how would you convey that you know

3976.859 --> 3981.299
what I mean it's like

3978.42 --> 3983.94
you know it's the sun like yeah it's

3981.299 --> 3985.079
just like it's just the Sun but like how

3983.94 --> 3987.0
do you

3985.079 --> 3988.319
show in a picture like this is

3987.0 --> 3990.839
holographic

3988.319 --> 3993.5389999999998
what

3990.839 --> 3995.64
you would have to like then say it's

3993.539 --> 3998.7000000000003
like it's being projected or something

3995.64 --> 4001.0989999999997
like have a camera in the corner

3998.7 --> 4005.3799999999997
and then the line like it's being

4001.099 --> 4005.38
projected and then the Sun but I mean

4008.18 --> 4013.339
maybe that will work

4010.88 --> 4015.319
although it is almost literally straw

4013.339 --> 4016.88
Manning my own argument because that's

4015.319 --> 4018.98
not what I think is happening it's not

4016.88 --> 4020.48
being projected from one specific spot

4018.98 --> 4023.72
like that

4020.48 --> 4026.799
but I mean how else are you gonna

4023.72 --> 4026.799
communicate it

4026.839 --> 4032.96
siren light for derpcon

4030.319 --> 4035.2
oh yeah that's a good one the durapacon

4032.96 --> 4035.2
system

4042.02 --> 4046.72
I could just have a list of derpcon

4044.18 --> 4050.359
where it's just derp con

4046.72 --> 4053.74
one two three four five

4050.359 --> 4053.74
with different colors

4057.98 --> 4065.2
and it's just those five not two and a

4061.64 --> 4065.2
half not six

4136.219 --> 4142.96
in one of the Chinese Bible why why the

4140.0 --> 4142.96

4143.66 --> 4148.9
what a ridiculous thing to say Aries

4146.06 --> 4148.900000000001

[Music]

4180.38 --> 4184.0

4210.26 --> 4213.26

4215.48 --> 4220.178999999999
where they're supposed to be

4217.699 --> 4220.178999999999
right

4227.239 --> 4232.28
foreign

4229.159 --> 4234.86
I mean yeah I mean dude trolling has a

4232.28 --> 4238.4
time and a place trolling can be kind of

4234.86 --> 4240.98
fun but if it's just like stalking and

4238.4 --> 4243.5599999999995
just being nasty

4240.98 --> 4247.639999999999
then it's not fun that's not funny

4243.56 --> 4250.42
trolling that's just bullying annoying

4247.64 --> 4250.42
miserable

4253.82 --> 4258.98
right but yeah super sensitive

4256.159 --> 4261.5599999999995
snowflakes might think anybody that

4258.98 --> 4262.339999999999
doesn't see oh yes yes oh you're so

4261.56 --> 4264.38
great

4262.34 --> 4266.360000000001
if you don't say that then they think

4264.38 --> 4268.88
you're already a troll yeah okay well

4266.36 --> 4272.0599999999995
you're gonna get some

4268.88 --> 4273.32
silly trolls after you that are actually

4272.06 --> 4275.54
kind of fun

4273.32 --> 4278.08
just to expose that I am not against

4275.54 --> 4278.08
that even

4278.48 --> 4283.4
I'm not super interested in it because I

4281.48 --> 4285.379999999999
think it's a kind of a waste of time a

4283.4 --> 4288.0199999999995
bit

4285.38 --> 4290.2390000000005
I mean I've had my time where where

4288.02 --> 4292.6990000000005
social justice Warrior stuff and all

4290.239 --> 4294.86
that was kind of funny to me

4292.699 --> 4298.04
like oh my God these people are so

4294.86 --> 4300.799999999999
ridiculous ha ha but I'm just like over

4298.04 --> 4302.84
that I mean

4300.8 --> 4305.4800000000005
are you understand it now much more for

4302.84 --> 4309.64
what that is what where these people are

4305.48 --> 4309.639999999999
in their lives to become like that

4309.679 --> 4313.2390000000005
and I pity them more

4315.199 --> 4319.699
and so I don't really feel like haha we

4317.42 --> 4320.84
got to make fun of them or something I

4319.699 --> 4323.239
don't know

4320.84 --> 4325.6
it's just mentally ill people to me

4323.239 --> 4325.599999999999
really

4328.76 --> 4333.34
a squirt bottle no a coma virus

4335.12 --> 4338.5
not gonna do that

4359.9 --> 4365.5599999999995
we need something for when someone is

4362.06 --> 4365.56
squirting no you don't

4365.6 --> 4370.52
you're just gonna have to say it I don't

4368.0 --> 4372.76
want emoticons of that that's terrible

4370.52 --> 4372.76
idea

4378.62 --> 4384.38
technically I don't even want to use

4381.199 --> 4389.08
that word as much and you might notice

4384.38 --> 4389.08
that I use it less because it's just

4389.54 --> 4392.739
that's less necessary

4400.699 --> 4406.099999999999
I mean usually I use the word squirting

4403.52 --> 4409.219
for when a person that is actually kind

4406.1 --> 4411.8
of good trying to do good like getting

4409.219 --> 4413.54
out of control getting like obsessed

4411.8 --> 4415.9400000000005
with something and getting unnecessarily

4413.54 --> 4419.38
aggressive or something right that's

4415.94 --> 4419.379999999999
when I call out squirting

4420.92 --> 4423.76
typically

4426.02 --> 4433.84
one of my favorite things you say okay I

4429.92 --> 4433.84
got it from Owen Benjamin to be fair

4434.42 --> 4442.659
he says it all the time but he gets

4437.96 --> 4442.659
really gross too so I'm not doing that

4446.9 --> 4451.879999999999
but yeah no I I'll keep saying it

4449.78 --> 4456.0199999999995
occasionally but I don't want some

4451.88 --> 4458.0
emoticon for that I do not want that

4456.02 --> 4460.46
it's just going to encourage more

4458.0 --> 4462.44
grossness

4460.46 --> 4463.76
I mean that emoticon is going to stare

4462.44 --> 4467.799999999999
you in the face and it's going to be

4463.76 --> 4467.8
hahaha I don't want that

4468.8 --> 4474.14
I don't want to pass out ideas like that

4471.92 --> 4478.54
I'll just use the word when it's

4474.14 --> 4478.54
appropriate and just keep it to that

4485.42 --> 4491.4800000000005
right

4487.94 --> 4493.0199999999995
what I mean it's a reasonable suggestion

4491.48 --> 4494.36
I'm just not doing that

4493.02 --> 4496.219
[Music]

4494.36 --> 4498.86

4509.78 --> 4516.639999999999
extremely long overdue

4512.679 --> 4519.5
actually so long overdue that one of the

4516.64 --> 4522.56
uh emoticons that I'm going to be

4519.5 --> 4525.199
putting in there is not even in effect

4522.56 --> 4527.42
anymore which is tumeric coffee I used

4525.199 --> 4529.58
to drink that all the time like the LA

4527.42 --> 4533.179
the first three

4529.58 --> 4535.34
or even four years that I've done this

4533.179 --> 4538.219
that would be trademark

4535.34 --> 4540.02
something that I did no I draw stopped

4538.219 --> 4543.29
drinking coffee but I'm still gonna put

4540.02 --> 4546.4890000000005
in a turmeric coffee emoticon

4553.4 --> 4560.0599999999995
and besides that is actually not like I

4557.42 --> 4563.7390000000005
use that sometimes but I'm basically

4560.06 --> 4563.7390000000005
lending it from QE

4568.58 --> 4575.5599999999995
besides like what even like how would

4571.88 --> 4575.56
you emoticonize that

4577.52 --> 4585.9400000000005
like what what is the visual of a numpty

4581.9 --> 4589.94
right I mean that makes no sense

4585.94 --> 4593.0
Himalayan rock salt emoji

4589.94 --> 4596.0199999999995
why oh which I by the way don't really

4593.0 --> 4596.02
use anymore either

4610.76 --> 4616.9400000000005
I mean yeah erase you we could use

4614.54 --> 4619.34
emoticons for all the little things that

4616.94 --> 4623.799999999999
I typically use like turmeric and fish

4619.34 --> 4623.8
oil and colloid also but

4626.92 --> 4632.12
it's just basically adding a word and

4630.32 --> 4635.38
then adding a picture it's not really

4632.12 --> 4635.38
going to translate well

4635.84 --> 4641.3
I mean himalayans

4638.48 --> 4643.959999999999
rock salt it isn't Rock

4746.3 --> 4750.9800000000005

4747.38 --> 4752.78
well it would make a good little picture

4750.98 --> 4755.78
you see

4752.78 --> 4755.78
recognizable

4762.739 --> 4769.099999999999

around out the show Emoji what

5290.86 --> 5295.86
what is how are you gonna make an emoji

5293.5 --> 5295.86
of that

5296.8 --> 5299.28
joke

5317.46 --> 5324.12
a muted emoji

5321.4 --> 5324.12
foreign

5325.06 --> 5331.92
I'd prefer if people would just say mute

5328.9 --> 5331.92
or no sound

5332.02 --> 5338.280000000001
it's gonna be emoticon I it's just gonna

5335.199 --> 5338.28
be confusing to me

5340.9 --> 5345.638999999999
still realize I do actually read the

5343.179 --> 5347.4400000000005
chat right I read the words more than I

5345.639 --> 5350.1
look at the emoticons

5347.44 --> 5350.099999999999
so

5351.76 --> 5359.679
anyway we got a ton of these ideas

5355.739 --> 5361.959999999999
Nathan Oakley emoji

5359.679 --> 5365.4400000000005

I rumpus I need a freaking rumpus head

5379.3 --> 5383.1990000000005
what the hell was I thinking

5381.699 --> 5387.219
of course

5383.199 --> 5391.54
the rumpus Emoji his face

5387.219 --> 5394.719
of course what the hell was I thinking

5391.54 --> 5397.92
I'd be crazy not to have that emoji of

5394.719 --> 5397.92
course we have to have that

5400.36 --> 5408.159
because it is an actual applied word so

5404.62 --> 5411.96
right see that is what you want an emoji

5408.159 --> 5413.739
for yeah thank you for reminding me

5411.96 --> 5416.5
indirectly

5413.739 --> 5419.159
rumpus almost forgot about it definitely

5416.5 --> 5419.159
has to be in there

5420.76 --> 5422.9400000000005
foreign

5428.04 --> 5432.88
but it I mean

5430.48 --> 5438.48
I'm not gonna like it when you see

5432.88 --> 5438.4800000000005
little Emoji emoticons of emojis

5438.52 --> 5442.26
of my own face for example

5442.36 --> 5446.259999999999
but I might like do one of me and of

5444.52 --> 5447.22
Nathan in there

5446.26 --> 5450.419
Maybe

5447.22 --> 5450.419
[Music]

5452.739 --> 5457.36
nah I don't want it no but I definitely

5455.26 --> 5462.0
want one of rumpus definitely because

5457.36 --> 5462.0
it's literally it has a meaning

5466.0 --> 5468.78
right

5474.27 --> 5477.439

Jared Sanford

5531.58 --> 5536.26
right anyway I think I'm probably gonna

5534.58 --> 5538.54
maneuver towards rounding out the show

5536.26 --> 5540.92
unless somebody brings up a brilliant

5538.54 --> 5542.56
other idea

5540.92 --> 5545.08
[Music]

5542.56 --> 5547.42
let's go through it shall we

5545.08 --> 5551.4

the relative density emoticon although

5575.56 --> 5580.54
yeah I'm not entirely sure which one if

5578.32 --> 5584.5
that's going to work out

5580.54 --> 5588.159
then Channel logo irregular troll

5584.5 --> 5592.38

5599.739 --> 5602.82
it's pretty good right

5608.199 --> 5613.0599999999995
just naming all that in the row that

5611.199 --> 5615.82
does seem like a pretty cool range of

5613.06 --> 5617.080000000001
emoticons doesn't it

5615.82 --> 5620.44
foreign

5617.08 --> 5622.6
