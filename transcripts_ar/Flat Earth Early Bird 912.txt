foreign

7.75 --> 37.579
[Music]

65.6 --> 69.36
good morning

67.92 --> 71.76
mm-hmm

69.36 --> 75.6
oh welcome to Flat Earth early bird

71.76 --> 77.10000000000001
number 912 I'm your host Arwin and

75.6 --> 79.259
before we start the show please don't

77.1 --> 81.24
forget to share it on any platform you

79.259 --> 83.159
didn't fit and if you haven't already

81.24 --> 85.38
subscribe to my channel and hit the Bell

83.159 --> 88.259
notification so you know when I'm going

85.38 --> 90.42
live which is normally 1pm Amsterdam

88.259 --> 92.939
time in the weekdays and 2 p.m Amsterdam

90.42 --> 94.86
time in the weekend and please also do

92.939 --> 96.83999999999999
support me through the PayPal patreon

94.86 --> 98.579
crypto wallet Super Chat and membership

96.84 --> 102.02000000000001
system join button

98.579 --> 102.02
that would be much appreciated

102.24 --> 107.52
so

104.759 --> 110.57900000000001
I'm a little late again

107.52 --> 113.69999999999999
just this heat man

110.579 --> 117.83999999999999
time experience is different

113.7 --> 121.46000000000001
when it's this warm I still

117.84 --> 121.46000000000001
get some taking used to

122.42 --> 127.43900000000001
yeah the weather today again is quite

125.399 --> 129.0
beautiful

127.439 --> 132.06
it's a

129.0 --> 135.599
some slight Haze here and there

132.06 --> 138.48
it does feel like it's more moist

135.599 --> 141.2
though it hasn't rained or anything not

138.48 --> 141.2
even in the Nike

142.44 --> 147.84
the night was overall just yeah it was

145.56 --> 150.9
that type of weather that really makes

147.84 --> 156.12
me want to stay up like even not doing

150.9 --> 158.78
too much because it's just so nice

156.12 --> 158.78
in

160.08 --> 165.84
The Exchange after the day's heat it's

163.739 --> 167.16
just such nice temperature at night and

165.84 --> 170.94
it

167.16 --> 173.72
yeah really keeps me up

170.94 --> 176.64
so it's a bit of a chore getting to bed

173.72 --> 180.56
when the weather's just that nice and

176.64 --> 180.55999999999997
it's so pleasant to be active you

181.379 --> 187.22
because like right now the temperature

183.659 --> 189.12
here in this room is pretty hot

187.22 --> 190.08
[Music]

189.12 --> 192.659
but

190.08 --> 194.09900000000002
yeah the sun is almost at the angle

192.659 --> 197.28
where it's not going to hit the wall

194.099 --> 200.06
anymore here on that side

197.28 --> 200.06
it's gonna get better

200.94 --> 207.35999999999999
yeah

203.22 --> 210.84
hello George Sanford first in chat

207.36 --> 214.81900000000002
oh wow okay

210.84 --> 214.81900000000002
is that a big problem George Sanford

216.9 --> 222.42000000000002
yeah I just wanted to inform also you

220.2 --> 224.28
guys and

222.42 --> 227.33999999999997
Flat Earth debaters

224.28 --> 230.4
that yeah Nathan apparently had a

227.34 --> 233.0
emergency dentist appointment

230.4 --> 235.86
I hope he hadn't caught anything from me

233.0 --> 238.019
psychosomatically but probably not

235.86 --> 242.04000000000002
I know he has some issues like with his

238.019 --> 244.5
jaws and [ __ ] as well

242.04 --> 247.62
so he's not doing a live Flat Earth

244.5 --> 250.439
debate today so I might continue on the

247.62 --> 252.92000000000002
show a little bit longer

250.439 --> 252.92
Maybe

255.59 --> 260.4
[Music]

258.06 --> 266.58
anyway it is

260.4 --> 266.58
Wednesday the 2nd of June 2021

276.0 --> 278.78
what

278.84 --> 285.979
ISS probe hit by space debris

283.02 --> 285.979
oh really

294.24 --> 299.12
when and where did that supposedly

296.759 --> 299.12
happen

325.44 --> 329.34
okay George Sanford did you just make it

328.62 --> 331.62
up

329.34 --> 335.52
on the spot

331.62 --> 337.44
or did this supposedly happen anywhere

335.52 --> 340.46
where did you

337.44 --> 340.46
read it

347.3 --> 353.12
rtus hmm

350.639 --> 353.12
okay

359.34 --> 366.479
I I had just scrolled through it I

362.94 --> 370.039
didn't I didn't see anything about it

366.479 --> 370.039
no ISS

373.979 --> 377.35999999999996
let me look more carefully

386.16 --> 388.94
nope

397.139 --> 400.759
it's it's not in my list

401.039 --> 407.21999999999997
Lucky Strike in the title

404.34 --> 409.46
okay I'll look that up thanks for the

407.22 --> 409.46000000000004
tip

416.039 --> 422.36
oh this is from yesterday right

419.58 --> 422.35999999999996
what the

453.919 --> 459.96
I'm looking at the photo of the arm with

457.38 --> 462.599
a hole in it uh

459.96 --> 466.4
I don't know man that looks like really

462.599 --> 466.4
cheap ass fabric

468.84 --> 473.35999999999996
it looks kind of like a paper bag

473.52 --> 477.96
or maybe a cloth bag but it doesn't

476.099 --> 480.71999999999997
really seem that

477.96 --> 485.18
it's not like plastic

480.72 --> 485.18
or steel or aluminum or something

489.18 --> 495.44
right anyway I'll link that I'll link it

492.18 --> 495.44
in chat it is kind of funny

497.639 --> 501.5
thanks for the tip Jared Sanford

506.29 --> 509.369
[Music]

526.68 --> 531.5999999999999
now if you take this all very very

529.38 --> 534.0
seriously

531.6 --> 538.44
like ball Winwood

534.0 --> 539.88
then you could theorize okay so they can

538.44 --> 543.3000000000001
technically now

539.88 --> 546.6
figure out what was the space debris

543.3 --> 551.54
so they I don't know

546.6 --> 551.5400000000001
load the arm back into uh

552.2 --> 558.48
pressurized room or whatever or and they

555.66 --> 560.88
can just like get there get the piece

558.48 --> 565.62
that hit it

560.88 --> 567.86
and then do a very Vivid analyzation of

565.62 --> 570.42
it to figure out where did it come from

567.86 --> 572.82
what actually hit it if it's space

570.42 --> 575.42
debris space debris of what

572.82 --> 575.4200000000001
right

575.519 --> 582.86
but I I kind of doubt they've thought

579.42 --> 582.86
that far ahead

601.68 --> 606.68
and I kind of doubt they have like

603.54 --> 609.959
spectral analysis machines on the ISS

606.68 --> 612.56
would be very handy though to have but I

609.959 --> 612.56
doubt they do

612.72 --> 614.899
foreign

618.899 --> 623.16
it's just that okay if you're gonna act

621.0 --> 625.56
like you have a bunch of men floating in

623.16 --> 628.86
a thing in space and they're doing

625.56 --> 633.0
science well a Spectra analysis machine

628.86 --> 634.0790000000001
would indeed be very useful to analyze

633.0 --> 637.26
stuff

634.079 --> 641.16
right including well whatever space

637.26 --> 645.42
debris or maybe some meteorite samples

641.16 --> 649.019
or who knows a known alien materials

645.42 --> 650.64
right for whatever story purpose but

649.019 --> 652.62
yeah they never

650.64 --> 655.76
brought it up

652.62 --> 655.76
as far as I know

665.7 --> 672.6800000000001
anyway hello seeking star water man bear

669.3 --> 672.68
Dela pet fee

674.579 --> 678.92
oh God bad fee not you too

681.959 --> 687.8389999999999
why pet feet well because he's just a

684.899 --> 690.18
he's a bottom liner with the argument so

687.839 --> 691.62
he

690.18 --> 695.459
hey

691.62 --> 698.76
it all presupposes too much

695.459 --> 701.579
and he saw he has even addressed it

698.76 --> 704.88
right now the official gravity can't

701.579 --> 708.12
even calculate for the suggestion of the

704.88 --> 710.959
of title forces

708.12 --> 710.9590000000001
because of the Moon

711.899 --> 717.72
so he did actually address it it was

715.44 --> 720.5
just being snowed ignored and then

717.72 --> 720.5
snowed under

721.92 --> 730.0999999999999
and besides I had addressed it that same

725.88 --> 730.1
show on my show yesterday so

730.25 --> 735.66
[Music]

731.839 --> 740.12
was it the day before

735.66 --> 740.12
who was it again it was a couple of guys

741.42 --> 746.76
that were bringing it up

743.639 --> 748.94
hello Guns of Navarone rmp good to see

746.76 --> 748.9399999999999
you

758.04 --> 760.2199999999999
foreign

768.17 --> 771.2199999999999
[Music]

781.62 --> 785.94
yes so you can start water well the

783.959 --> 788.6389999999999
thing is there's the tides that are

785.94 --> 791.2790000000001
supposedly caused by old gravitation

788.639 --> 793.0790000000001
Newtonian gravitation

791.279 --> 795.0
with the Moon

793.079 --> 798.3199999999999
right just like how it's supposed to

795.0 --> 798.32
have 1 6 gravity

799.139 --> 804.54
it's the story that came from that from

801.839 --> 807.4200000000001
the mass attracting Mass

804.54 --> 810.36
effect of the presupposed ball Earth and

807.42 --> 813.4799999999999
the ball Moon

810.36 --> 815.399
to yeah it was like predicted this is

813.48 --> 817.139
going to happen then of course that

815.399 --> 819.3
doesn't happen at all

817.139 --> 821.699
and then it's figured out like oh what

819.3 --> 824.399
must be the other

821.699 --> 827.9399999999999
like they kind of neutralize

824.399 --> 830.04
out off the end result is of the

827.94 --> 832.98
protection

830.04 --> 835.199
they kind of just like play it down but

832.98 --> 838.62
at the same time uphold the idea that

835.199 --> 843.8389999999999
there is the the effect of the tidal

838.62 --> 848.4590000000001
forces they keep it locked in with

843.839 --> 850.86
the orbital bodies and their yeah their

848.459 --> 853.0189999999999
Newtonian gravity influence they keep it

850.86 --> 856.019
locked in tight with that that's what

853.019 --> 859.26
the guys did in my chat

856.019 --> 861.6
right but they can't really pin it down

859.26 --> 864.3
to like okay title forces this is what's

861.6 --> 868.0790000000001
gonna do on Earth because it would

864.3 --> 870.779
create this giant bulge in the ocean

868.079 --> 873.7199999999999
that would just go around once a day and

870.779 --> 876.86
drown everything in its path

873.72 --> 876.86
and that doesn't happen

878.519 --> 882.66
that's not how it happens at all when

880.32 --> 886.0790000000001
you actually look at the tide Maps

882.66 --> 889.079
it's just a bunch of circling spots

886.079 --> 890.279
it's like it's magnetic just how it

889.079 --> 893.12
looks

890.279 --> 898.74
what it really reminded me of is like

893.12 --> 900.839
laboratory mixing systems like I uh with

898.74 --> 903.12
my when I was still with my ex

900.839 --> 907.9200000000001
we ordered this system through the

903.12 --> 909.48
Infowars store or related was a tip they

907.92 --> 911.699
brought it up

909.48 --> 913.32
my ex was really interested she still

911.699 --> 916.8599999999999
has the device

913.32 --> 919.5
and it had like this glass uh what you

916.86 --> 922.0790000000001
call it laboratory mixing glass

919.5 --> 924.86
and then yeah you have you put

922.079 --> 928.38
the electrolytes

924.86 --> 930.0600000000001
the electrolyte

928.38 --> 932.04
how do you call that

930.06 --> 935.2399999999999
in English damn it

932.04 --> 935.24
I always get that wrong

937.74 --> 943.549
[Applause]

956.16 --> 959.16
electrolysis

959.339 --> 963.32
right

960.899 --> 966.36
okay okay

963.32 --> 969.44
electrolysis right the electrolysis of

966.36 --> 969.44
the silver elements

969.48 --> 975.779
and then there is this thing

972.0 --> 977.22
like magnetic pill that you put at the

975.779 --> 979.56
bottom and then there's a magnet

977.22 --> 984.12
underneath the glass

979.56 --> 989.5999999999999
that then you yeah uses the pill

984.12 --> 992.639
to mix the thing and that is the most

989.6 --> 996.899
remarkable resemblance with when you

992.639 --> 999.54
look at the tight Maps it's just like

996.899 --> 1003.44
this circular thing that just keeps is

999.54 --> 1006.519
mixing at certain spots in a certain way

1003.44 --> 1006.519
so magnetic

1015.019 --> 1020.66
yes seeking star water thanks for that

1017.899 --> 1024.4
so in my opinion

1020.66 --> 1028.459
this devastating correlation between

1024.4 --> 1030.5
magnetic patterns and the tides right so

1028.459 --> 1033.26
it's magnetic there's nothing to do with

1030.5 --> 1037.579
like densities or

1033.26 --> 1040.22
pulling on masses upward

1037.579 --> 1043.6989999999998
it's not like that it's probably more

1040.22 --> 1048.319
likely it's it's being pushed

1043.699 --> 1051.88
or well maybe yeah it it must be pushed

1048.319 --> 1051.8799999999999
otherwise why would it rise

1052.28 --> 1055.72
it's not being pulled off

1062.74 --> 1067.64
electoral Isis electrolysis

1068.96 --> 1071.38
okay

1091.88 --> 1100.4
is that really important is it is it

1094.7 --> 1103.16
like all or is it Electro I'm not sure

1100.4 --> 1106.4
this is one of those words that I really

1103.16 --> 1109.22
learned early on through Dutch

1106.4 --> 1111.799
which makes me kind of accidentally tap

1109.22 --> 1113.96
into the different word range and that's

1111.799 --> 1116.299
kind of confusing when I try to because

1113.96 --> 1119.299
it's so close

1116.299 --> 1119.299
electrolysis

1119.36 --> 1123.2199999999998
I've heard people pronounce it like that

1123.98 --> 1128.679
is this all kinds of way that people

1125.9 --> 1128.679
pronounce it

1137.299 --> 1142.72
when you say it in Dutch it's like

1139.52 --> 1142.72
really Electro

1144.08 --> 1149.72
oh that the O is is like that

1147.74 --> 1152.1200000000001
it's always like that in Dutch and

1149.72 --> 1153.22
that's yeah and all the other ways of

1152.12 --> 1156.9799999999998
saying it

1153.22 --> 1159.94
yeah electrolysis

1156.98 --> 1159.94
electrolysis

1161.059 --> 1166.96
that's in Dutch

1162.98 --> 1166.96
it's remarkably similar isn't it

1182.08 --> 1185.32
quasi-american r

1189.26 --> 1194.02
right well when I talk Dutch I do

1196.1 --> 1203.539
I change the way R is pronounced I adapt

1200.66 --> 1206.38
my R very much to the English language

1203.539 --> 1209.48
which doesn't use ah

1206.38 --> 1211.22
because that's just that's weird to

1209.48 --> 1215.659
English in a way

1211.22 --> 1219.02
the Dutch use it very pronounced like

1215.659 --> 1221.96
having power over R in language

1219.02 --> 1223.8799999999999
kind of gives Dutch and Edge

1221.96 --> 1225.559
if you don't overplay too much become

1223.88 --> 1227.74
that because then it just gets annoying

1225.559 --> 1227.74
and

1235.28 --> 1244.4189999999999
I guess it is more French like that

1239.539 --> 1244.419
because they have absolutely use the ah

1245.84 --> 1249.82
seven over six ah

1260.72 --> 1263.679
after all

1273.679 --> 1276.46
okay

1281.96 --> 1286.3600000000001
yes audio I'm Billy

1287.14 --> 1292.5200000000002
welcome back

1289.82 --> 1296.36
but yes I do take care of my English

1292.52 --> 1298.46
because I really don't like the idea

1296.36 --> 1301.76
that it might be like oh yeah whatever

1298.46 --> 1304.3400000000001
and then I keep cascading the same exact

1301.76 --> 1305.84
annoying air that might annoy a whole

1304.34 --> 1308.6
bunch of people

1305.84 --> 1311.12
that even if I make it the first time

1308.6 --> 1313.6999999999998
they will be intuitively waiting for

1311.12 --> 1316.2199999999998
when is he finally gonna correct that so

1313.7 --> 1318.6200000000001
yeah it's important for me

1316.22 --> 1322.88
for my continuing mission

1318.62 --> 1325.539
to improve and that absolutely includes

1322.88 --> 1325.5390000000002
the language

1329.72 --> 1335.419
so I'm not shy to look it up and hey I

1332.72 --> 1337.1000000000001
got a good excuse because English is not

1335.419 --> 1340.159
my native language

1337.1 --> 1342.559
so how is it shameful to look up my own

1340.159 --> 1345.98
language right even if it's if it is

1342.559 --> 1346.8799999999999
your home your born language then of

1345.98 --> 1349.28
course

1346.88 --> 1351.14
there's no shame in looking it up as

1349.28 --> 1353.799
well but sometimes it might feel a

1351.14 --> 1353.7990000000002
little bit awkward

1354.559 --> 1360.02
unless you're really a linguist language

1357.62 --> 1362.9599999999998
fanatic

1360.02 --> 1364.039
and I am a little

1362.96 --> 1367.1200000000001
right

1364.039 --> 1367.12
hey Amanda Young

1376.58 --> 1379.72
my thetas

1389.0 --> 1393.1
they're perfect cool thanks

1397.46 --> 1403.46
well it's also

1400.4 --> 1406.1000000000001
why am I good at the pronunciations of

1403.46 --> 1407.9
certain English elements that most Dutch

1406.1 --> 1410.6
people have more trouble with it's

1407.9 --> 1413.539
because when it was really young this is

1410.6 --> 1417.28
really thanks to Optimus Prime

1413.539 --> 1417.28
because when I was really young

1417.74 --> 1424.94
the American language right from

1420.34 --> 1427.1589999999999
Transformers G1 it inspired me so much

1424.94 --> 1429.919
it's like this foreign language and it's

1427.159 --> 1432.2600000000002
really cool and they're they're good

1429.919 --> 1434.8400000000001
right they had a good vibe coming off it

1432.26 --> 1438.14
and really open and free

1434.84 --> 1440.36
and it just inspired me

1438.14 --> 1443.539
when I still didn't really understand it

1440.36 --> 1447.1999999999998
although I had like text references

1443.539 --> 1449.059
because we had Dutch subtitles with it

1447.2 --> 1451.82
at the time

1449.059 --> 1455.059
so it was American spoken with Dutch

1451.82 --> 1456.02
subtitles but I would just try to pair

1455.059 --> 1459.3999999999999
it

1456.02 --> 1462.799
what they said kind of the practice

1459.4 --> 1465.3200000000002
emulating that speech

1462.799 --> 1467.539
yeah parent parent learning and that's

1465.32 --> 1470.24
how very early on I got a lot of

1467.539 --> 1473.24
practice to get these typical American

1470.24 --> 1473.24
pronunciations

1473.299 --> 1479.12
to get that right to train that at like

1476.059 --> 1481.1
pre-teen aged completely from my own

1479.12 --> 1484.4599999999998
volition right nobody was telling me to

1481.1 --> 1487.52
do that no I wanted to do that and other

1484.46 --> 1489.14
people also stepped in when I was doing

1487.52 --> 1490.279
that and they're like oh yeah this is

1489.14 --> 1493.22
how you pronounced so they would

1490.279 --> 1496.419
encourage me too with it sometimes

1493.22 --> 1496.419
so yeah it's just

1496.58 --> 1501.9189999999999
it gave me

1499.46 --> 1505.3400000000001
very early

1501.919 --> 1508.039
skills and I'm very happy about that now

1505.34 --> 1509.8999999999999
very very happy

1508.039 --> 1513.08
feel blessed

1509.9 --> 1517.24
so thank you Optimus Prime

1513.08 --> 1517.24
for inspiring me in many ways

1520.6 --> 1525.8799999999999
great voice by the way that guy what a

1523.7 --> 1525.88
legend

1527.419 --> 1532.4
because he really has the spirit in it

1529.76 --> 1535.1
like that guy when he acts

1532.4 --> 1536.779
out something most of the time he really

1535.1 --> 1538.8799999999999
means it

1536.779 --> 1540.919
like that carries in the voice whatever

1538.88 --> 1543.3200000000002
they do with it like however they

1540.919 --> 1548.0590000000002
digitize it or whatever

1543.32 --> 1548.059
it's just it's that guy anyway

1557.84 --> 1560.4399999999998
hmm

1563.96 --> 1571.1000000000001
right yeah howdy Billy

1567.02 --> 1573.58
Dutch exchange Dutch exchange students

1571.1 --> 1573.58
had trouble

1573.86 --> 1580.6
with the language it's there's this

1576.32 --> 1580.6
weird situation about it as well right

1581.299 --> 1587.6
fake traces of Dutch culture memories

1584.98 --> 1589.4
for my side because I'm not really that

1587.6 --> 1591.74
integrated anymore with the culture

1589.4 --> 1594.1000000000001
whatever's left of it

1591.74 --> 1596.48
been drifting away from it for a while

1594.1 --> 1599.9189999999999
but when I was really young I got the

1596.48 --> 1599.919
Sensation that people just

1600.919 --> 1606.8600000000001
many PR proud linguists exist in the

1605.179 --> 1608.779
Netherlands that are really good at

1606.86 --> 1612.1999999999998
several languages

1608.779 --> 1616.159
but also it was very well understood

1612.2 --> 1618.8600000000001
that Dutch even though we get annoyed by

1616.159 --> 1620.419
Dutch accents and all that right a lot

1618.86 --> 1622.6999999999998
of Dutch people get annoyed when other

1620.419 --> 1625.5800000000002
Dutch people like really have the thick

1622.7 --> 1628.279
accent I do I'm one of those people I

1625.58 --> 1630.1399999999999
find it annoying but I don't hold it

1628.279 --> 1633.44
against them right but there's this

1630.14 --> 1636.7990000000002
weird thing for some reason people from

1633.44 --> 1640.22
other countries especially Americans

1636.799 --> 1642.26
it's like exotic to them when we have

1640.22 --> 1646.3990000000001
the Dutch accent it's like oh it's also

1642.26 --> 1648.799
European oh it's like exotic to them so

1646.399 --> 1651.5
because of that also Dutch people that

1648.799 --> 1655.1589999999999
go to other countries

1651.5 --> 1658.279
they kind of let let the accent roll

1655.159 --> 1660.5
because of that

1658.279 --> 1662.72
so they don't really adapt their

1660.5 --> 1665.0
linguistic skills as much because they

1662.72 --> 1666.32
kind of want to use their exotic Oh I'm

1665.0 --> 1667.7
European

1666.32 --> 1670.9399999999998
tongue

1667.7 --> 1673.3990000000001
to get attention of people it's

1670.94 --> 1677.38
so it doesn't surprise me that the

1673.399 --> 1677.3799999999999
exchange student couldn't get it right

1678.32 --> 1682.24
right it made me think of that

1687.32 --> 1691.0
it's not top for sexiness

1694.82 --> 1702.86
maybe but I think it does

1699.14 --> 1705.26
kind of like give this intellectual vibe

1702.86 --> 1708.3799999999999
or something I don't know what it is

1705.26 --> 1710.6589999999999
maybe it's like the German scientist

1708.38 --> 1713.0800000000002
accent effect

1710.659 --> 1715.5390000000002
or something something in that direction

1713.08 --> 1719.799
it's just this weird

1715.539 --> 1719.799
archetypal association with it

1740.71 --> 1743.829
[Music]

1752.179 --> 1754.8990000000001
huh

1758.059 --> 1763.279
are there a lot of Dutch living in

1761.0 --> 1766.7
Johannesburg or South Africa

1763.279 --> 1769.419
well there's family roots

1766.7 --> 1769.419
for sure

1769.76 --> 1775.279
but

1771.679 --> 1777.14
I don't know how like how much like

1775.279 --> 1779.38
traveling interaction there even is

1777.14 --> 1779.38
anymore

1779.96 --> 1786.559
like the Netherlands has changed in a

1782.96 --> 1788.8400000000001
lot of ways and hey so has

1786.559 --> 1791.48
South Africa because it had a lot of

1788.84 --> 1793.58
like it's basically going through like a

1791.48 --> 1795.6200000000001
really nasty Revolution

1793.58 --> 1797.899
situation

1795.62 --> 1799.8799999999999
for a while

1797.899 --> 1802.76
where the boars are being attacked by

1799.88 --> 1804.679
the Communist Party pretty much it's

1802.76 --> 1807.14
that's been going on for why it's heated

1804.679 --> 1809.779
up even further at the same time the

1807.14 --> 1812.659
Netherlands is being barraged by

1809.779 --> 1814.46
the Communist Party in in the net in the

1812.659 --> 1817.88
Dutch setting with just endless

1814.46 --> 1822.08
intellectual bureaucracy obstructions

1817.88 --> 1825.44
and just continuing attempting to trick

1822.08 --> 1829.52
the people into accepting the forwarding

1825.44 --> 1832.88
of the whole agenda it's very annoying

1829.52 --> 1835.58
but at least yeah there's no

1832.88 --> 1838.7600000000002
physical groups like hunting down people

1835.58 --> 1840.9189999999999
here thank God right that that is

1838.76 --> 1843.34
happening in in South Africa it's pretty

1840.919 --> 1843.3400000000001
horrific

1878.28 --> 1881.359
[Music]

1881.659 --> 1886.959
foreign

1883.65 --> 1886.959
[Music]

1896.059 --> 1902.059
oh you have never noticed that no

1898.94 --> 1904.64
seeking star water it's been there from

1902.059 --> 1907.1589999999999
since the overhaul

1904.64 --> 1909.7
never noticed it before

1907.159 --> 1909.7
hmm

1914.539 --> 1919.899
well there's a lot to get distracted

1919.94 --> 1924.2
in The View

1921.86 --> 1926.86
the background and the planes flying by

1924.2 --> 1926.8600000000001
and all that

1929.299 --> 1933.799
but yes

1930.799 --> 1937.7
the picture is like a

1933.799 --> 1941.019
a stone early bird logo pretty much Adam

1937.7 --> 1941.019
made it pretty cool huh

1942.74 --> 1945.74
foreign

1961.659 --> 1968.44
artist and I should have noticed

1965.6 --> 1968.4399999999998
ah

1969.62 --> 1974.84
well the Mind always plays tricks on you

1972.559 --> 1977.96
like that it hides things from you

1974.84 --> 1980.1789999999999
because it prioritizes it as to like

1977.96 --> 1982.46
this is going to distract I'll just make

1980.179 --> 1985.94
you forget it in the moment not take

1982.46 --> 1988.1000000000001
make it take notice until later and then

1985.94 --> 1990.44
at some point it just comes drifting

1988.1 --> 1991.4599999999998
Minds like there like hi I always was

1990.44 --> 1994.3990000000001
there

1991.46 --> 1996.8600000000001
I'm used to that a lot

1994.399 --> 1998.1789999999999
it's been happening to me since I was a

1996.86 --> 2001.539
little kid

1998.179 --> 2004.1200000000001
because well with me I figured out why

2001.539 --> 2007.179
it's because

2004.12 --> 2009.1
things impress me so much like I can get

2007.179 --> 2013.8400000000001
so much data

2009.1 --> 2016.48
like sensory data out of things that

2013.84 --> 2019.4399999999998
because of that block it out not to get

2016.48 --> 2021.76
overwhelmed and so my mind's basically

2019.44 --> 2024.46
or my subconscious starts to

2021.76 --> 2026.14
strategically decide for me when to let

2024.46 --> 2028.6200000000001
in things

2026.14 --> 2028.6200000000001
hahaha

2033.279 --> 2038.14
right and for me what typically May

2036.039 --> 2039.58
resulted into

2038.14 --> 2041.74
was

2039.58 --> 2045.24
that when I was stressed out I would

2041.74 --> 2045.24
just be constantly in my head

2045.94 --> 2051.339
the kind of egotistical

2048.46 --> 2054.339
but still try to do my best and then

2051.339 --> 2056.859
when the stress is over it's like oh

2054.339 --> 2059.74
I look around it's like whoa what's that

2056.859 --> 2061.359
and that because I just didn't pick it

2059.74 --> 2062.6789999999996
up before that because I was too

2061.359 --> 2065.22
preoccupied

2062.679 --> 2065.2200000000003
hmm

2071.5 --> 2076.899
all right and hey I never really pointed

2074.919 --> 2079.44
it out like hey did you see that eagle

2076.899 --> 2079.44
up there

2089.079 --> 2096.3590000000004
refraction is real is it

2092.02 --> 2096.359
what type of refraction is is that

2109.48 --> 2112.48
foreign

2119.98 --> 2125.14
how come there is

2122.2 --> 2127.839
a long delay

2125.14 --> 2131.64
on the message well it's because the the

2127.839 --> 2131.64
text input for the chat

2131.859 --> 2138.72
there is no delay but in OBS the bottom

2135.76 --> 2138.7200000000003
part is cut off

2139.599 --> 2145.06
and why I do that is because if somebody

2141.88 --> 2146.98
starts to post nasty messages then I can

2145.06 --> 2148.72
quickly remove it and it'll never be

2146.98 --> 2151.3
seen

2148.72 --> 2155.3999999999996
like I can literally prevent people from

2151.3 --> 2155.4
getting distracted by it that way

2156.76 --> 2161.2000000000003
so

2158.68 --> 2163.839
that way there is a delay

2161.2 --> 2166.96
there's like two

2163.839 --> 2169.38
three lines of delay before it becomes

2166.96 --> 2169.38
visible

2175.66 --> 2178.7799999999997
[Music]

2190.72 --> 2193.3199999999997
hmm

2219.88 --> 2222.88
foreign

2234.94 --> 2241.2400000000002
28 degrees over there AGM wow let's see

2238.839 --> 2243.96
what temperature is here probably

2241.24 --> 2243.9599999999996
similar

2244.66 --> 2248.7599999999998
yep it's 28 degrees here too

2249.04 --> 2252.96
it was like that yesterday as well

2253.119 --> 2259.42
right ah finally there's some no longer

2255.88 --> 2261.7200000000003
is hitting the wall it's like a such a

2259.42 --> 2261.7200000000003
relief

2262.24 --> 2266.0989999999997

2281.32 --> 2286.54
well iron 26

2284.26 --> 2290.88
where 28

2286.54 --> 2290.88
Celsius in the winter really

2292.48 --> 2295.8
to where do you live then

2309.4 --> 2312.4
laughs

2313.3 --> 2317.079
oh

2314.74 --> 2320.68
let me get involved there how do y'all

2317.079 --> 2325.44
Billy I'm Billy

2320.68 --> 2325.44
boats disappear bottom up too

2325.599 --> 2329.099
uh yeah

2329.26 --> 2334.96
that's because of diffraction remember

2332.619 --> 2336.7000000000003
limited viewing angle it happens on

2334.96 --> 2340.0
confirmed flat surfaces you can

2336.7 --> 2344.2599999999998
empirically test this yourself

2340.0 --> 2347.859
take any measured confirmed flat surface

2344.26 --> 2350.5
then look closely past it and move

2347.859 --> 2352.96
objects over that flat surface as you're

2350.5 --> 2354.24
looking you'll start to notice that it

2352.96 --> 2357.52
will

2354.24 --> 2359.7999999999997
conceal parts of the object you're

2357.52 --> 2362.079
moving into the distance over that

2359.8 --> 2364.0600000000004
measured confirmed flat surface because

2362.079 --> 2366.3390000000004
that happens it's a part of Optics it's

2364.06 --> 2368.619
not because the objects you're moving it

2366.339 --> 2369.88
over is curved no in the contrary

2368.619 --> 2372.4
can

2369.88 --> 2375.2400000000002
even on relatively small size objects

2372.4 --> 2375.2400000000002
this works

2377.14 --> 2383.2599999999998
right a really easy way to do it

2380.5 --> 2386.98
is to have a setup

2383.26 --> 2389.6800000000003
of like colored cubes

2386.98 --> 2391.78
like even Legos could work different

2389.68 --> 2393.339
colors you click them

2391.78 --> 2396.4
on each other

2393.339 --> 2399.04
and make it a pretty long thing

2396.4 --> 2401.579
right you put it on the table you start

2399.04 --> 2404.14
looking over it you see

2401.579 --> 2406.3590000000004
segments of color into the distance and

2404.14 --> 2409.1189999999997
then at some point it stops

2406.359 --> 2411.94
but you can then count

2409.119 --> 2414.819
how far you could see

2411.94 --> 2417.52
based on yeah the color segments until

2414.819 --> 2419.98
they stop as you look right over it or

2417.52 --> 2422.2
you put a camera right over it right

2419.98 --> 2425.5
it's because

2422.2 --> 2427.4199999999996
bottom-up concealment is optic inherent

2425.5 --> 2431.04
it happens when you look over a flat

2427.42 --> 2431.04
surface because of diffraction

2434.26 --> 2437.98
right it's not because there is a

2436.3 --> 2440.6800000000003
geometric curve in the way because it

2437.98 --> 2444.28
happens on confirmed flat surfaces

2440.68 --> 2446.9199999999996
even in the short run

2444.28 --> 2448.48
so it's purely Optics and it happens on

2446.92 --> 2451.1800000000003
every scale

2448.48 --> 2455.16
it's a scalable effect for the the

2451.18 --> 2455.16
closer you look to the surface

2455.68 --> 2460.5
The Closer by the optical slant effect

2458.5 --> 2463.359
will migrate

2460.5 --> 2464.44
obstructing or concealing things behind

2463.359 --> 2468.359
it

2464.44 --> 2468.359
bottom up at a linear rate

2469.18 --> 2472.74
let me show the diagram

2472.839 --> 2476.88
good old diagram

2496.359 --> 2500.4
hey here we go again good to see you

2528.4 --> 2532.9
yeah

2530.2 --> 2537.16
wow

2532.9 --> 2540.339
wait are you actually drawing

2537.16 --> 2542.98
scientific evidence of water boiling at

2540.339 --> 2545.64
a hundred degrees Celsius in doubt audio

2542.98 --> 2545.64
Billy

2549.16 --> 2554.2
because yes there's other influences the

2551.44 --> 2557.5
purities will also determine what the

2554.2 --> 2559.74
boiling point will be the more saturated

2557.5 --> 2559.74
foreign

2566.2 --> 2571.06
but if you take all everything out of it

2569.14 --> 2573.819
and just make it pure water you will

2571.06 --> 2576.96
find that it'll boil at 100 degrees at

2573.819 --> 2576.96
regular ground pressure

2583.359 --> 2588.94
right but if you put stuff in the water

2586.48 --> 2591.339
like salt you'll find that it'll

2588.94 --> 2595.44
actually start boiling quicker that's I

2591.339 --> 2595.44
it's even basically applied in cooking

2595.599 --> 2599.2000000000003
all right you want to boil water for

2597.46 --> 2601.599
whatever

2599.2 --> 2604.359
rice

2601.599 --> 2607.78
or spaghetti

2604.359 --> 2610.359
well I put like salt in the water

2607.78 --> 2612.94
because it boils quicker

2610.359 --> 2616.5
and hey I have no objection having a

2612.94 --> 2616.5
little salt through the through it

2619.0 --> 2624.66
usually add some oil to it or something

2621.64 --> 2624.66
later on

2648.64 --> 2651.48
whoa

2657.599 --> 2663.7000000000003
88 degree Fahrenheit how much is that

2661.06 --> 2666.96
seeking style water

2663.7 --> 2666.96
sounds kind of hot

2677.319 --> 2682.24
Ah that's a 31 degrees Celsius yeah that

2680.859 --> 2685.24
seems kind of hot

2682.24 --> 2688.02
that's like mid-summer heat

2685.24 --> 2688.02
for us

2724.72 --> 2729.3999999999996
high altitudes in your expression

2727.18 --> 2732.339
machine behave differently

2729.4 --> 2734.6800000000003
right well different pressure

2732.339 --> 2737.319
yeah the different pressure will cause

2734.68 --> 2738.52
water to respond differently to boil

2737.319 --> 2741.88
quicker

2738.52 --> 2744.06
right lower pressure lowers the boiling

2741.88 --> 2744.06
point

2749.56 --> 2753.88
all right and most machines are

2751.839 --> 2756.839
specifically made for just regular

2753.88 --> 2756.839
ground level pressure

2782.14 --> 2784.92
foreign

2800.44 --> 2807.88
who

2802.24 --> 2807.8799999999997
o nice George Sanford that sounds great

2809.44 --> 2814.06
yeah my my kitchen plants are doing

2811.9 --> 2817.06
great as well

2814.06 --> 2819.339
like the the basil plant that I showed

2817.06 --> 2822.64
on the show while back like it's still

2819.339 --> 2825.54
blossoming like it's it's not given up

2822.64 --> 2825.54
just yet

2826.119 --> 2831.099
although it is kind of like visibly

2828.28 --> 2833.619
aging because of that right after that

2831.099 --> 2838.599
it's gonna like retire

2833.619 --> 2838.599
maybe die maybe start re restarting

2840.339 --> 2845.5
but the other bezel plan is doing great

2843.76 --> 2848.1400000000003
and

2845.5 --> 2850.119
my oregano plan also like there's like

2848.14 --> 2853.42
the strings on it that are this long now

2850.119 --> 2856.26
they're like really is reaching out

2853.42 --> 2856.26
and

2857.74 --> 2863.7999999999997
I'm I got some parsley

2861.28 --> 2865.6600000000003
yeah you have to keep on pouring water

2863.8 --> 2867.76
in that thing

2865.66 --> 2871.48
but it's nice

2867.76 --> 2874.7200000000003
because yeah I wanted some fresh parsley

2871.48 --> 2877.66
for some special sauces

2874.72 --> 2880.0589999999997
like with garlic

2877.66 --> 2881.7999999999997
mayonnaise

2880.059 --> 2884.7400000000002
parsley

2881.8 --> 2887.7400000000002
and fresh oregano so it's like all of it

2884.74 --> 2891.52
fresh oh

2887.74 --> 2894.0989999999997
it's a really good stuff and then I use

2891.52 --> 2898.079
that especially in combination with like

2894.099 --> 2901.9
a self-boiled potatoes like not

2898.079 --> 2904.6800000000003
pre-packaged Frozen stuff or anything

2901.9 --> 2908.319
with a lot of salt pepper and rosemary

2904.68 --> 2909.48
and just like bake that or

2908.319 --> 2913.24
oh

2909.48 --> 2916.0
that that's like an old classic of mine

2913.24 --> 2917.9799999999996
but it is a lot of work

2916.0 --> 2920.74
so I don't do it that often but I

2917.98 --> 2923.46
decided to do it

2920.74 --> 2923.4599999999996
again

2928.859 --> 2936.96
Ginger lime hot sauce okay

2933.46 --> 2936.96
that sounds odd

2937.24 --> 2939.7799999999997
hmm

2940.24 --> 2948.52
oh I got a bun by the way but it's a

2944.319 --> 2951.339
I forgot about it all this food talk and

2948.52 --> 2953.339
making me hungry

2951.339 --> 2953.339
um

2963.47 --> 2966.6099999999997
[Music]

2970.44 --> 2973.619
[Music]

2988.13 --> 2991.219
[Music]

3022.819 --> 3027.02
grilled fish hmm

3075.9 --> 3078.9
foreign

3090.0 --> 3094.319
and now I'm thinking about

3092.52 --> 3096.599
barbecuing

3094.319 --> 3099.14
man has it been a long time since I ever

3096.599 --> 3099.1400000000003
did that

3127.98 --> 3132.7400000000002
uh

3129.48 --> 3132.7400000000002
well here we go again

3133.079 --> 3138.96
after he yeah after the last meeting

3136.8 --> 3141.8390000000004
that I reported on

3138.96 --> 3143.7
he's pretty much just I don't know gone

3141.839 --> 3145.98
off on vacation or something I haven't

3143.7 --> 3147.72
heard of him ever since

3145.98 --> 3149.64
so

3147.72 --> 3152.3999999999996
I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be all

3149.64 --> 3155.0589999999997
over just yet but he's just he's

3152.4 --> 3155.059
dropping it

3197.28 --> 3200.1800000000003
foreign

3204.26 --> 3208.8590000000004
guns have never owned

3206.819 --> 3212.4
foreign

3208.859 --> 3215.4
yeah I forget that sometimes

3212.4 --> 3218.819
it is very Audible

3215.4 --> 3220.319
right but I just happen to be very

3218.819 --> 3223.7599999999998
hungry right now

3220.319 --> 3223.7599999999998
it had a bit of a delay

3241.38 --> 3245.79
foreign

3242.56 --> 3245.79
[Music]

3249.24 --> 3252.3599999999997
[Music]

3275.16 --> 3281.46
so again for all that don't know

3278.16 --> 3285.18
there's no flat Earth debates today

3281.46 --> 3287.599
because Nathan is off to the dentist for

3285.18 --> 3287.5989999999997
an emergency

3289.2 --> 3294.74
so I might yeah continue the show on a

3292.2 --> 3294.74
little longer

3297.42 --> 3301.2200000000003
or who knows hey what

3301.859 --> 3304.7
am I right

3336.839 --> 3342.98
the sipping reminds me of sip yeah I had

3339.72 --> 3342.98
the whole bunch of trolls

3344.59 --> 3347.739
[Music]

3358.26 --> 3361.2200000000003
ah

3372.24 --> 3377.7
but yeah I

3374.22 --> 3382.52
I pretty much banned all of those

3377.7 --> 3382.52
all the wins the troll wins

3388.2 --> 3391.3799999999997
thank you

3388.98 --> 3394.04
I don't really see them too often

3391.38 --> 3394.04
anymore around

3404.339 --> 3408.44
hey Andrew good to see you

3434.819 --> 3437.48
what

3441.42 --> 3447.14
hey was kiwi was there a QE live

3444.78 --> 3447.1400000000003
yesterday

3451.2 --> 3457.04
I'm just seeing it that completely

3454.26 --> 3457.0400000000004
escaped me by

3473.76 --> 3478.6800000000003
thank you

3475.819 --> 3479.819
ride seeking so I don't know why it's

3478.68 --> 3482.359
just like

3479.819 --> 3485.16
those trolls they like to emphasize and

3482.359 --> 3488.42
encourage just obsessive compulsive

3485.16 --> 3488.42
Behavior it seemed

3493.02 --> 3497.88
apparently there is a whole range of

3495.24 --> 3500.0589999999997
people that are like really triggered by

3497.88 --> 3500.059
it

3501.48 --> 3506.88
by people consuming things on shows

3504.66 --> 3508.5
especially if like they have trouble

3506.88 --> 3510.6600000000003
switching

3508.5 --> 3513.96
like from food mode

3510.66 --> 3515.16
to thinking mode

3513.96 --> 3517.98
I think

3515.16 --> 3519.72
because like it did come up like almost

3517.98 --> 3522.98
as a subject

3519.72 --> 3522.98
a couple of years ago

3524.04 --> 3528.9
but yeah I don't really care I just

3526.44 --> 3530.4
drink tea you know like drinking tea

3528.9 --> 3534.0
during

3530.4 --> 3536.299
my show is literally kind of like my

3534.0 --> 3536.299
fuel

3536.46 --> 3541.319
and when I don't have tea I really start

3538.859 --> 3543.299
to feel dried out and then I'm like oh

3541.319 --> 3544.2599999999998
where's the tea where's the tea this

3543.299 --> 3546.24
happens

3544.26 --> 3547.98
a couple of shows

3546.24 --> 3550.6189999999997
I just start to miss it

3547.98 --> 3553.02
like unless it's so unbelievably hot

3550.619 --> 3556.319
that it just a hot drinks are only gonna

3553.02 --> 3558.24
be like uh making it worse

3556.319 --> 3559.38
I'm kind of on the edge with that right

3558.24 --> 3561.7799999999997
now

3559.38 --> 3564.559
I'm also planning to maybe start making

3561.78 --> 3564.559
lemonade again

3567.72 --> 3574.0789999999997
and then I might have some of that

3569.46 --> 3576.299
during the show nice cool drinks

3574.079 --> 3578.599
still have lemonade from like two years

3576.299 --> 3578.599
ago

3580.44 --> 3583.579
like concentrate

3583.74 --> 3587.8999999999996
so that should still be good

3598.98 --> 3604.44
you'd never have to justify my actions

3601.26 --> 3608.1800000000003
well yeah I do feel I do

3604.44 --> 3608.18
but mostly towards myself

3616.28 --> 3622.2200000000003
right people do things because of

3619.619 --> 3622.2200000000003
reasons

3624.359 --> 3629.299
it's just a good thing to establish it's

3626.4 --> 3629.299
part of honesty

3641.64 --> 3644.64
narcissism

3645.119 --> 3649.859
maybe well there are a whole bunch of

3647.76 --> 3651.119
people probably out there on the

3649.859 --> 3655.46
internet

3651.119 --> 3655.46
that's that have drowned so much in

3655.5 --> 3661.26
in social media that they're starting to

3659.04 --> 3663.42
kind of like chisel away at what it is

3661.26 --> 3666.9
to be a normal human being

3663.42 --> 3668.819
right they start to form an act

3666.9 --> 3672.2400000000002
of themselves

3668.819 --> 3674.7599999999998
excluding anything about it that they

3672.24 --> 3676.9199999999996
don't like about themselves

3674.76 --> 3678.119
right that's really when the narcissism

3676.92 --> 3681.48
comes in

3678.119 --> 3685.319
because then they're just acting like

3681.48 --> 3687.059
it's their act of their personhood

3685.319 --> 3689.94
on the internet

3687.059 --> 3692.4
like in chat

3689.94 --> 3694.5
well the real person is just kind of

3692.4 --> 3696.42
trying to hide the elements they don't

3694.5 --> 3697.98
like about themselves

3696.42 --> 3700.44
they're just hiding it to themselves

3697.98 --> 3702.54
right but then

3700.44 --> 3704.76
you'll get agitated when other people

3702.54 --> 3706.5589999999997
don't do that when they're just

3704.76 --> 3709.0200000000004
straightforward honest and

3706.559 --> 3711.299
confrontational as much as possible

3709.02 --> 3714.359
especially when they do it in a sensible

3711.299 --> 3716.339
way because then they feel guilty for

3714.359 --> 3720.359
not doing it

3716.339 --> 3722.46
for not being honest not getting over

3720.359 --> 3724.619
the the things that they don't really

3722.46 --> 3728.099
like about themselves to become

3724.619 --> 3729.839
themselves more become more unified with

3728.099 --> 3731.579
yeah

3729.839 --> 3734.119
with who you really are and your path

3731.579 --> 3734.119
and everything

3734.7 --> 3738.74
and then they start attacking you for

3736.559 --> 3738.7400000000002
that

3739.619 --> 3745.02
because they don't like your being so

3742.079 --> 3748.079
honest because they want an image to go

3745.02 --> 3751.7599999999998
around in everybody to adapt it

3748.079 --> 3754.559
where it's normalized that you just

3751.76 --> 3756.42
exclude elements about yourself you

3754.559 --> 3758.6400000000003
erase them or you pretend they don't

3756.42 --> 3761.4
exist like you pretend you never have

3758.64 --> 3763.94
pain for example or that you're never

3761.4 --> 3763.94
scared

3765.0 --> 3771.599
that you're like almost robotic that you

3768.42 --> 3773.88
have as little human like typical dirty

3771.599 --> 3776.579
human traits as possible there's all

3773.88 --> 3779.94
kinds of things that people latch onto

3776.579 --> 3782.78
in their kind of like narcissistic Alter

3779.94 --> 3782.78
Ego mode

3783.299 --> 3788.22
where they want to keep their conscience

3785.46 --> 3791.099
they it's like their ideal self what to

3788.22 --> 3792.48
them is ideal that's what they enact and

3791.099 --> 3794.76
that's what they

3792.48 --> 3797.64
start to conflate with actual reality

3794.76 --> 3800.28
they drift on their own delusion

3797.64 --> 3804.5589999999997
but in order to keep drifting you have

3800.28 --> 3804.559
to pull everybody down to your level

3806.039 --> 3810.599
to how you want things to be done like

3808.68 --> 3813.18
so you start to attack people like no

3810.599 --> 3816.0
you shouldn't do that you shouldn't eat

3813.18 --> 3820.14
or drink on camera

3816.0 --> 3822.24
or you shouldn't admit when you made a

3820.14 --> 3824.0389999999998
mistake well that's a big one for a

3822.24 --> 3826.2599999999998
whole bunch of people even that we deal

3824.039 --> 3827.88
with here at the Flat Earth debates crew

3826.26 --> 3831.44
and all that

3827.88 --> 3831.44
and you guys in chat

3837.359 --> 3840.68
hey Shatner's bassoon

3849.299 --> 3853.92
well Tom Parker

3851.64 --> 3856.3799999999997
you know having a snack on screen it

3853.92 --> 3858.78
depends though right

3856.38 --> 3861.119
if you're like doing a show that is kind

3858.78 --> 3864.119
of about food or about restaurants or

3861.119 --> 3866.579
whatever then yeah it's like involving

3864.119 --> 3868.6800000000003
food and then having food on the camera

3866.579 --> 3871.02
as part of your show or part of some

3868.68 --> 3874.14
review or whatever or like is oh look

3871.02 --> 3876.18
I'm gonna try it out I like this or I

3874.14 --> 3878.339
don't like this or whatever right that's

3876.18 --> 3880.14
logical

3878.339 --> 3882.14
it's just that

3880.14 --> 3885.96
when a show is typically about

3882.14 --> 3887.5989999999997
mind-blowing information or like science

3885.96 --> 3889.799
or

3887.599 --> 3892.2000000000003
the hyper

3889.799 --> 3894.96
Globe physics or

3892.2 --> 3897.5389999999998
sci-fi space thing perhaps something

3894.96 --> 3900.119
that's not really about food

3897.539 --> 3901.7400000000002
then it can be extremely distracting if

3900.119 --> 3903.1800000000003
you just like in the middle of what

3901.74 --> 3905.64
you're doing just starting eating it's

3903.18 --> 3907.6189999999997
like super distracting like

3905.64 --> 3909.72
like people get triggered like no no

3907.619 --> 3910.799
eating on the work floor type of

3909.72 --> 3914.819
response

3910.799 --> 3919.2599999999998
right no eating during work

3914.819 --> 3924.0
but I'm me me and my show

3919.26 --> 3925.6800000000003
I have kind of a raw life journal thing

3924.0 --> 3930.14
going

3925.68 --> 3933.48
that's my setup so I have specific

3930.14 --> 3936.44
exclusion from that because people eat

3933.48 --> 3939.0
and people eat even when they're talking

3936.44 --> 3941.099
and a lot of people might have memories

3939.0 --> 3942.66
from way back

3941.099 --> 3945.78
I do

3942.66 --> 3948.5389999999998
where there would be dinner and then

3945.78 --> 3951.2400000000002
there would be dinner conversation

3948.539 --> 3953.039
like dinner conversation as a little kid

3951.24 --> 3955.799
with my family

3953.039 --> 3957.599
really was this

3955.799 --> 3960.299
in

3957.599 --> 3962.579
just like getting serious with the mind

3960.299 --> 3966.0
and working through things and even like

3962.579 --> 3968.52
correcting me oh my God always my family

3966.0 --> 3970.859
was correcting me and it was kind of

3968.52 --> 3973.619
painful at times but it was really good

3970.859 --> 3975.7799999999997
like it really sharpened me up made me

3973.619 --> 3977.7000000000003
take things very serious because

3975.78 --> 3979.8590000000004
eventually I just didn't want to be

3977.7 --> 3983.0389999999998
caught out making a mistake so I didn't

3979.859 --> 3985.2
get too comfortable with oh I'm gonna

3983.039 --> 3988.26
think however I like no no it's always

3985.2 --> 3990.359
like be correct use the right words

3988.26 --> 3994.3390000000004
think

3990.359 --> 3994.339
of like the history of things

3994.5 --> 3998.64
dinner conversation that was a whole big

3996.48 --> 4001.52
tradition so to me

3998.64 --> 4004.16
eating while being intellectual actually

4001.52 --> 4006.74
is completely the opposite of with a lot

4004.16 --> 4009.5
of people that are will have like no

4006.74 --> 4011.839
no eating on the work floor

4009.5 --> 4013.819
type of mindset and response no for me

4011.839 --> 4016.4
eating is

4013.819 --> 4018.5
when the energy in the good minerals and

4016.4 --> 4021.92
vitamins get in and

4018.5 --> 4024.799
when you start talking and thinking

4021.92 --> 4028.76
right but they're probably a whole range

4024.799 --> 4030.619
of people that just didn't get that

4028.76 --> 4033.26
their parents might have been very

4030.619 --> 4035.2400000000002
closed and like keeping things private

4033.26 --> 4037.099
not really wanting to have this

4035.24 --> 4039.2599999999998
intellectual communication with the

4037.099 --> 4042.02
family

4039.26 --> 4044.2990000000004
so then they don't have that

4042.02 --> 4046.94
Association

4044.299 --> 4048.14
for me eating is associated with

4046.94 --> 4052.0
brilliance

4048.14 --> 4052.0
because that's what happens after

4052.28 --> 4054.46
foreign

4056.48 --> 4061.339
thing that is super annoying though is

4059.119 --> 4063.859
when somebody is like in the middle of

4061.339 --> 4066.2
laying down something really important

4063.859 --> 4068.119
a bigger train of thinking and they

4066.2 --> 4070.0389999999998
start eating then and that they

4068.119 --> 4072.079
interrupt literally the talking because

4070.039 --> 4073.94
they

4072.079 --> 4076.579
chew

4073.94 --> 4078.5
like the waiting on it yeah like if it's

4076.579 --> 4081.1400000000003
like in the middle of talking that can

4078.5 --> 4082.64
be a little annoying but in between oh

4081.14 --> 4085.339
that's fine

4082.64 --> 4087.5789999999997
Look at me now I'm being nitpicky about

4085.339 --> 4087.5789999999997
it

4095.24 --> 4099.44
right so as long as you don't eat and

4097.46 --> 4103.779
have a conversation literally at the

4099.44 --> 4103.7789999999995
same time then it's all fine by me

4107.42 --> 4112.339
right it can even be tactically

4110.5 --> 4114.679
exploited

4112.339 --> 4117.92
if you're eating

4114.679 --> 4120.4400000000005
and you're both very talkative you might

4117.92 --> 4123.02
have like rumpus effects right we have

4120.44 --> 4125.3589999999995
it at the social media world at the Flat

4123.02 --> 4129.14
Earth debate even with among friends

4125.359 --> 4132.14
well if you have something to eat then

4129.14 --> 4133.9400000000005
you can literally use it to take turns

4132.14 --> 4137.179
it's like okay

4133.94 --> 4138.98
he's going to explode in a response like

4137.179 --> 4141.1990000000005
with a lot of talk

4138.98 --> 4142.459999999999
I'm just gonna start biting down to

4141.199 --> 4146.3589999999995
prevent

4142.46 --> 4149.92
being pushy and rumpusy right and

4146.359 --> 4149.92
tactical use everything

4151.46 --> 4155.54
it's like okay this guy is going to talk

4153.259 --> 4158.9
now I'm that's a good opportunity to

4155.54 --> 4163.64
start eating to prevent staying focused

4158.9 --> 4167.799
on wanting to get back in and

4163.64 --> 4167.799
and basically get a little rompussy

4173.54 --> 4178.819
I have a glazed donut

4176.0 --> 4182.659
in the fridge calling me it's

4178.819 --> 4185.4400000000005
right enjoy that Guns of Navarone

4182.659 --> 4185.44
Donuts

4196.88 --> 4200.7390000000005
no guns have never owned no

4201.5 --> 4208.36
this isn't I'm this is not some kind of

4203.96 --> 4208.36
a response towards you it's just like

4208.94 --> 4213.28
somebody brought it up earlier was it

4211.1 --> 4213.280000000001
you

4219.08 --> 4223.12
scroll back somebody brought it up

4233.659 --> 4239.599999999999
no I I brought it up

4236.9 --> 4242.0
for some reason you're starting to talk

4239.6 --> 4244.400000000001
about gardening

4242.0 --> 4245.719
then it rolled into food and then I

4244.4 --> 4248.199
brought it up

4245.719 --> 4248.199
right

4252.62 --> 4258.64
and then I got hungry

4254.78 --> 4258.639999999999
and then I started to Chow Down

4266.49 --> 4269.62
[Music]

4273.44 --> 4277.12
hello random Explorer

4277.28 --> 4283.48
oh farm fresh eggs oh

4280.04 --> 4283.48
I'm a little jealous now

4292.34 --> 4294.82
hmm

4295.96 --> 4302.7390000000005
French toast with Taco berries

4299.3 --> 4302.7390000000005
that sounds pretty amazing

4311.78 --> 4318.099999999999
oh I had some really late well yeah

4315.14 --> 4318.1
midnight dinner

4318.26 --> 4323.0
I did a classic

4320.42 --> 4325.76
it's based on something we figured out

4323.0 --> 4327.38
in Spain when we were on summer vacation

4325.76 --> 4331.46
my parents

4327.38 --> 4335.179
and that is take a good bread

4331.46 --> 4337.88
like a pretty hard baked bread

4335.179 --> 4340.219
so it gets kind of crispy I use spelled

4337.88 --> 4345.08
bread for this

4340.219 --> 4348.62
slice it into and then put uh

4345.08 --> 4350.0599999999995
freshly sliced tomato bits right you

4348.62 --> 4352.5199999999995
peel it

4350.06 --> 4354.56
tomato on both sides and you let it kind

4352.52 --> 4357.080000000001
of drench in there

4354.56 --> 4360.26
maybe use your knife to like kind of

4357.08 --> 4362.239
poke it into the soft bread

4360.26 --> 4365.84
so it soaks it up a bit

4362.239 --> 4368.718999999999
then use salami I use like beef only

4365.84 --> 4371.179
salami because yeah originally supposed

4368.719 --> 4373.4
to do with chorizo

4371.179 --> 4377.3
chorizo is

4373.4 --> 4381.32
like Parts pig meat though and I kind of

4377.3 --> 4383.78
avoid that it's is really like mean I

4381.32 --> 4386.0
don't like it because chorizo is just

4383.78 --> 4389.42
absolutely amazing

4386.0 --> 4392.96
right so you have the bread tomato

4389.42 --> 4394.1
very juicy and then the chorizo or the

4392.96 --> 4397.88
salami

4394.1 --> 4400.88
that we took that like to the beach

4397.88 --> 4403.219
and then you just sit in the in the heat

4400.88 --> 4405.1990000000005
soak up the sun a little or in the

4403.219 --> 4408.7390000000005
shadow it would be still you would get

4405.199 --> 4411.199
plenty of Sun even like under a parasol

4408.739 --> 4413.12
maybe get into the ocean then like in

4411.199 --> 4415.4
the ocean you cool off you get active

4413.12 --> 4418.46
then you get hungry

4415.4 --> 4421.04
oh my God I would then rush back and

4418.46 --> 4424.28
then take that bread and then just

4421.04 --> 4426.32
like eat the whole freaking thing oh so

4424.28 --> 4428.96
amazing

4426.32 --> 4432.88
and I had one of those like last night I

4428.96 --> 4432.88
still have one left to make

4434.659 --> 4438.44
that is so nice

4437.0 --> 4440.239
I have to be a bit careful though

4438.44 --> 4445.239
because it's kind of it's pretty hard

4440.239 --> 4445.239
bread to chew you have to be careful

4445.4 --> 4450.44
but I managed to eat the whole thing

4447.679 --> 4452.719
it's it's just this side right

4450.44 --> 4455.54
when I was a kid we would have breads

4452.719 --> 4458.12
that were like a meter long and then we

4455.54 --> 4462.94
do it like the entire bread a meter long

4458.12 --> 4462.94
bread and just oh so good

4463.28 --> 4468.38
because once once it gets you get eating

4466.4 --> 4471.82
with that it just doesn't stop you can

4468.38 --> 4471.82
just eat the whole freaking thing

4472.58 --> 4475.179
oh

4475.52 --> 4481.719
okay now I'm probably definitely making

4478.4 --> 4481.719
a couple of people hungry

4494.179 --> 4498.34
worked as a private Chef oh that's cool

4513.62 --> 4517.36
man bear Dela hungry now

4526.04 --> 4532.28
I have thought about it like

4528.56 --> 4535.6990000000005
it would be very cool at some point if I

4532.28 --> 4538.699
if I had a different house set up

4535.699 --> 4541.4
that I could basically

4538.699 --> 4542.659
if it would be a place where there is

4541.4 --> 4544.82
like the

4542.659 --> 4547.5199999999995
it's basically one giant room where the

4544.82 --> 4549.679
kitchen is right well could practically

4547.52 --> 4552.56
be right next to my computer

4549.679 --> 4555.1990000000005
then I could even do streams where I

4552.56 --> 4557.9800000000005
would literally just be cooking live

4555.199 --> 4557.98
and [ __ ]

4558.38 --> 4565.78
then have conversations while cooking

4561.44 --> 4565.78
oh I think that would be quite a blast

4570.14 --> 4577.06
but yeah the way things are set up it's

4572.659 --> 4577.0599999999995
it's just not possible Right

4577.58 --> 4580.719
like my desktop

4581.42 --> 4587.9
is not that easy to basically reinstall

4584.96 --> 4590.36
that takes like an hour

4587.9 --> 4592.4
there's a lot of wiring a lot it's just

4590.36 --> 4594.38
so much work to do that and then to

4592.4 --> 4596.48
reinstall that somewhere in the kitchens

4594.38 --> 4598.76
the kitchen right now to do it with this

4596.48 --> 4600.5599999999995
very little room it will be too much

4598.76 --> 4601.88
chaos too much danger that something

4600.56 --> 4604.84
might break

4601.88 --> 4604.84
of my computer

4605.0 --> 4611.44
so yeah that it can work as things are

4608.239 --> 4611.44
right now unfortunately

4621.62 --> 4625.179
oh she can start water

4631.3 --> 4637.159000000001
that's a funny one Tony Whitcomb

4634.4 --> 4640.9
if rumpus came in here now he would head

4637.159 --> 4640.9
straight to the crayon cupboard

4650.61 --> 4653.759999999999
[Music]

4711.02 --> 4716.4400000000005
hmm all right David Weiss just uploaded

4714.14 --> 4716.4400000000005
a video

4724.34 --> 4731.360000000001
I think right

4726.679 --> 4731.36
American Presidents referencing

4731.54 --> 4737.44
see

4732.8 --> 4737.4400000000005
old Bush and Obama

4741.8 --> 4744.34
cool

4746.3 --> 4753.04
I'll link up to David Wise

4749.239 --> 4753.04
it's a five minute video

4756.739 --> 4759.879999999999
check it out a little later

4760.4 --> 4763.5199999999995
is it on YouTube or

4762.44 --> 4767.0599999999995
what

4763.52 --> 4769.52
I I don't know Tony Whitcomb I don't

4767.06 --> 4772.3
have Facebook I never take a look at

4769.52 --> 4772.3
Facebook ever

4774.08 --> 4780.32
I I don't like what is it I I wouldn't

4778.159 --> 4782.299999999999
know what Facebook is what is this

4780.32 --> 4783.62
Facebook you talking about

4782.3 --> 4786.6990000000005
Facebook

4783.62 --> 4786.699
never heard of it

4789.86 --> 4794.9
I adamantly

4792.1 --> 4797.900000000001
rejected Facebook when it really came on

4794.9 --> 4800.179
and hey guess what like half the

4797.9 --> 4802.099999999999
Netherlands or more are on that freaking

4800.179 --> 4803.9
thing

4802.1 --> 4806.38
I really don't want to have anything to

4803.9 --> 4806.379999999999
do with it

4829.76 --> 4835.0
after you Dave

4831.739 --> 4835.0
on a TV show

4840.199 --> 4844.178999999999
but which Dave is that

4845.3 --> 4850.659000000001
is that like allegedly Dave

4848.0 --> 4850.659
that Dave

4853.639 --> 4856.659000000001
oh Dave Weiss

4856.76 --> 4859.3
cool

4875.719 --> 4878.56
foreign

4879.92 --> 4885.9800000000005
well you know what you know what

4882.139 --> 4888.86
Facebook really reminds me of these days

4885.98 --> 4893.0
just think about it

4888.86 --> 4893.0
it's called Facebook right

4894.8 --> 4898.609
so

4895.46 --> 4898.609
[Music]

4900.62 --> 4908.5599999999995
what's the best translation you could

4904.04 --> 4908.56
think of when you say Facebook right

4908.659 --> 4912.44
face book

4913.3 --> 4919.3
remember from Monty Python's Holy Grail

4916.159 --> 4919.299999999999
face book

4920.0 --> 4923.139
keep chanting

4924.98 --> 4931.48
that's what Facebook reminds me about

4928.159 --> 4931.48
has been for some time

4945.26 --> 4952.46
still though if you want to share my

4948.56 --> 4954.080000000001
show on any platform you deem fit hey if

4952.46 --> 4955.82
you want to pay post it on Facebook

4954.08 --> 4959.179
somewhere

4955.82 --> 4962.36
and Facebook allows that then hey that

4959.179 --> 4965.12
will be cool I'm I'm okay with people

4962.36 --> 4967.699
posting me on Facebook somewhere

4965.12 --> 4969.41
oh what's this

4967.699 --> 4973.179999999999
yeah

4969.41 --> 4973.18
[Music]

4973.76 --> 4980.2390000000005
uh they're doing a group call on Skype

4977.36 --> 4981.98
I might pick up on it later maybe have

4980.239 --> 4985.0599999999995
them join the show

4981.98 --> 4985.0599999999995
if they want to

4988.76 --> 4994.51
yeah exactly man bardela that's the one

4992.36 --> 4997.699
is

4994.51 --> 4997.6990000000005
[Music]

5014.38 --> 5020.32
has nobody thought of that before by the

5017.139 --> 5024.0
way it's like seriously

5020.32 --> 5024.0
I'm gonna keep this

5024.28 --> 5031.659
so I said hey it's just that face book

5029.62 --> 5035.38
face book

5031.659 --> 5038.08
yeah nobody ever saw that

5035.38 --> 5040.2390000000005
thought of that before that would be

5038.08 --> 5043.92
like bizarre

5040.239 --> 5043.919999999999
nobody thought of that before

5046.96 --> 5051.82
although I don't think that I've thought

5049.3 --> 5055.679
of it before

5051.82 --> 5055.679
but yeah I'm just one guy

5066.9 --> 5073.199
I got it okay let's finish up this

5070.0 --> 5073.199
sketch right

5073.239 --> 5081.459999999999
be a Facebook dominate

5077.34 --> 5081.46
Jonah is requiem

5081.58 --> 5083.76
foreign

5084.159 --> 5087.78
okay I'm done now

5117.34 --> 5124.42
foreign

5120.12 --> 5128.44
I'm not even too sure what it meant

5124.42 --> 5130.4800000000005
I I guess that that actually like

5128.44 --> 5133.839999999999
language technically

5130.48 --> 5136.599999999999
also made sense but I'm not like I never

5133.84 --> 5139.0
learned Latin guys like I I never went

5136.6 --> 5142.96
through that

5139.0 --> 5145.06
language tour in my school I could have

5142.96 --> 5147.46
had Latin in retrospect it would have

5145.06 --> 5150.219
been pretty cool if I had it but I I

5147.46 --> 5152.7390000000005
didn't go for that package probably

5150.219 --> 5154.659
because it also forced me to study

5152.739 --> 5157.239
French or something and I really didn't

5154.659 --> 5158.5599999999995
want to do that

5157.239 --> 5161.5599999999995
thank you

5158.56 --> 5161.56
yeah

5167.92 --> 5172.1990000000005
I may have just started the calls

5172.3 --> 5175.3
uh

5179.58 --> 5182.609
[Music]

5185.5 --> 5191.26
that would be ironic if I start a

5187.6 --> 5192.88
Facebook cult when I am not on Facebook

5191.26 --> 5194.38
I guess that would be kind of

5192.88 --> 5199.06
appropriate

5194.38 --> 5203.8
write a real cult leader never does

5199.06 --> 5206.620000000001
what he tells the cult followers to do

5203.8 --> 5208.900000000001
that's like the most typical thing about

5206.62 --> 5211.0599999999995
a cult

5208.9 --> 5212.92
a cult leader has one set of rules for

5211.06 --> 5216.04
him and then another set of rules for

5212.92 --> 5220.139
the cult follower so yeah I don't get on

5216.04 --> 5220.139
Facebook but since it's a Facebook cult

5231.4 --> 5236.799999999999
okay stop teaching it

5234.76 --> 5239.320000000001
really entirely

5236.8 --> 5241.78
I can't believe that

5239.32 --> 5243.639
like it's always going to be some kind

5241.78 --> 5246.699
of an option

5243.639 --> 5248.9800000000005
right we we in school even didn't get

5246.699 --> 5251.98
standard Latin it's not like you're

5248.98 --> 5257.32
always gonna learn Latin no

5251.98 --> 5259.239
but it was like a a package option

5257.32 --> 5260.739
when you went for the more language

5259.239 --> 5265.259999999999
oriented

5260.739 --> 5265.259999999999
route you would get Latin

5275.32 --> 5281.34
you call yourself in an arwenian

5278.739 --> 5281.339999999999
hmm

5291.58 --> 5297.28
yes here we go well it could take off as

5294.52 --> 5300.96
a meme thing right like planking

5297.28 --> 5300.96
you could make this

5302.5 --> 5307.62
Facebooking

5304.78 --> 5307.62
sorry

5309.239 --> 5316.178999999999
it would fit kind of the spirit of the

5312.159 --> 5318.46
times in many ways unfortunately

5316.179 --> 5322.06
and that might be just the level of

5318.46 --> 5324.04
irony it would need to take off as a

5322.06 --> 5325.780000000001
meme

5324.04 --> 5328.0
right

5325.78 --> 5330.3
who knows maybe I really did just start

5328.0 --> 5330.3
something

5330.89 --> 5334.219
[Music]

5337.78 --> 5344.329
[Music]

5371.5 --> 5374.4
mmm

5383.159 --> 5388.36
right hey Jim if you wanted to learn

5385.84 --> 5392.219
Latin you had to go to college

5388.36 --> 5395.139
and so you then have to pay the [ __ ]

5392.219 --> 5396.76
to learn what they're up to that's one

5395.139 --> 5400.32
way of putting it

5396.76 --> 5400.320000000001
it's certainly gonna help

5413.44 --> 5416.82
hey Amanda Young

5438.82 --> 5441.299999999999
hmm

5448.49 --> 5451.599999999999
[Music]

5473.04 --> 5479.219
what yeah my mic

5476.26 --> 5479.219
it's back

5508.179 --> 5511.7390000000005
oh [ __ ] hey Jim

5516.699 --> 5519.299999999999
ah

5520.239 --> 5526.98
get some aloe vera

5523.54 --> 5526.98
and coconut oil

5527.98 --> 5533.379999999999
if it's really badly burnt

5530.8 --> 5535.54
a gem then you might actually want to

5533.38 --> 5537.219
just pour some colloidal silver on there

5535.54 --> 5540.82
as well

5537.219 --> 5544.06
do that first like if like if it's like

5540.82 --> 5546.34
so bad it it's like really burnt yeah

5544.06 --> 5547.900000000001
you want to just douse it in colloidal

5546.34 --> 5551.400000000001
silver first

5547.9 --> 5551.4
before you do anything else

5560.32 --> 5564.719
coconut oil not a good idea is it

5567.52 --> 5571.4800000000005
okay

5569.26 --> 5574.6
I guess that if it's like really bad

5571.48 --> 5576.638999999999
then coconut oil is not a good thing to

5574.6 --> 5578.08
start out with maybe later

5576.639 --> 5582.179
when it's

5578.08 --> 5582.179
and it's already kind of restoring

5585.159 --> 5590.879999999999
but yeah definitely the colloidal silver

5587.5 --> 5590.88
and the aloe vera

5618.04 --> 5622.5
oh that's a nice thing to do Tony

5619.84 --> 5622.5
Whitcomb

5634.14 --> 5637.209000000001
[Music]

5649.06 --> 5654.76
Polynesians

5651.76 --> 5658.5
your Polynesian

5654.76 --> 5658.5
I didn't know that Michael work

5667.12 --> 5669.659
hmm

5682.119 --> 5688.0599999999995
right yeah our work is not re that's

5685.36 --> 5690.82
like an an Irish type name

5688.06 --> 5693.119000000001
so it doesn't straight out sound very

5690.82 --> 5693.119
black

5693.4 --> 5700.92
very dark-skinned O'Rourke

5697.0 --> 5700.92
so yeah I didn't see that one coming

5702.88 --> 5708.400000000001
hmm

5704.92 --> 5711.219
coconut oil to cooking

5708.4 --> 5715.299999999999
oh coconut I like coconut oil for any

5711.219 --> 5717.699
type of uh Asian

5715.3 --> 5720.58
rice related

5717.699 --> 5722.619
Den is really there's really the region

5720.58 --> 5725.139
where I start to love

5722.619 --> 5728.199
coconut oil

5725.139 --> 5731.4400000000005
but if it's not from there if it's more

5728.199 --> 5733.78
Mediterranean or just Dutch then I'll

5731.44 --> 5736.48
use oh well more Mediterranean I'll use

5733.78 --> 5737.619
olive oil more Dutch I'll typically use

5736.48 --> 5738.638999999999
butter

5737.619 --> 5741.28
right

5738.639 --> 5743.8
so it kind of depends on the meal it's

5741.28 --> 5746.08
also because of just the The Taste

5743.8 --> 5748.900000000001
effects right

5746.08 --> 5750.46
and coconut oil fits really well with

5748.9 --> 5753.0599999999995
most Asian

5750.46 --> 5753.06
food

5756.659 --> 5760.799999999999
Maori right cool

5761.619 --> 5765.78
yeah sorry to over generalize

5770.86 --> 5776.0199999999995
so here I've got kind of a brown

5773.98 --> 5779.5599999999995
far Asian

5776.02 --> 5782.400000000001
right Maori where is Maori exactly it's

5779.56 --> 5782.400000000001
an island right

5785.56 --> 5788.400000000001
where is that

5788.92 --> 5794.1990000000005
New Zealand

5791.199 --> 5797.94
okay well that's well pretty much the

5794.199 --> 5797.94
most remote Asian you can get

5825.58 --> 5828.119
hmm

5835.02 --> 5840.0
that's interesting hey Jim thanks for

5837.88 --> 5840.0
that

5844.46 --> 5848.899
[Music]

5854.76 --> 5861.46
right but Michael worked do you live

5859.36 --> 5864.5199999999995
in

5861.46 --> 5867.78
one of the British Isles or do you

5864.52 --> 5867.780000000001
actually live in New Zealand

5874.199 --> 5879.178999999999
Australia right to the mainland

5881.86 --> 5884.5199999999995
all right

5897.04 --> 5899.88
foreign

5914.679 --> 5921.119
cake back from UK

5918.159 --> 5921.119
what does that mean

5932.619 --> 5937.5599999999995
this is some kind of a British talk

5935.139 --> 5937.56
thing

5937.84 --> 5942.78
I'm not entirely following AGM

5943.06 --> 5948.820000000001
do that sometimes you get like on this

5945.82 --> 5952.259999999999
weird British frequency

5948.82 --> 5952.259999999999
that I don't fully understand

5958.42 --> 5964.0
but it isn't you are a bit of a library

5960.699 --> 5966.78
of like old sayings and [ __ ] and those

5964.0 --> 5966.78
are interesting

5992.8 --> 5995.8
anyway

6004.739 --> 6008.659
oh it's already three o'clock

6016.56 --> 6021.9800000000005
conflicts here sent over to established

6019.739 --> 6025.32
Australia

6021.98 --> 6027.599999999999
oh right

6025.32 --> 6030.54
that's what he meant right that's that

6027.6 --> 6032.04
is officially how Australia was indeed

6030.54 --> 6035.96
created right

6032.04 --> 6035.96
big prison colony

6036.48 --> 6039.739
labor and prison

6042.3 --> 6047.76
but technically if he's Maori then he's

6045.06 --> 6052.02
like a native

6047.76 --> 6056.1
so then he wouldn't be a prisoner son

6052.02 --> 6060.719
from UK or maybe some of his ancestors

6056.1 --> 6063.9800000000005
were one of them that that mixed up

6060.719 --> 6063.9800000000005
with the locals

6075.84 --> 6080.42
no majority were free settlers hmm

6097.8 --> 6099.9800000000005
foreign

6116.1 --> 6121.619000000001
yeah sometimes forget about that iron 26

6118.8 --> 6123.6
majority were free settlers because it's

6121.619 --> 6125.82
just that's how I originally learned it

6123.6 --> 6128.34
like Australia it's really big it was

6125.82 --> 6131.28
used as a prison colony

6128.34 --> 6133.4400000000005
by England that's like one of the first

6131.28 --> 6138.739
Associated memories right

6133.44 --> 6138.739
and of course it's a big piece of land

6138.78 --> 6143.36
with a lot of history and natives

6143.88 --> 6149.76
and yeah apparently it like it was also

6147.719 --> 6151.5
used as a prison Colony but not

6149.76 --> 6153.9800000000005
exclusively

6151.5 --> 6153.98
I guess

6181.44 --> 6183.619
foreign

6186.739 --> 6191.959999999999
I didn't know that George Sanford so the

6189.719 --> 6191.96
Mac

6192.9 --> 6196.339999999999
is like son of

6198.48 --> 6201.08
hmm

6206.1 --> 6212.820000000001
so by that sense like McDonald

6208.82 --> 6212.82
means Donald's

6212.88 --> 6216.139
right hmm

6237.6 --> 6240.1990000000005
right

6256.26 --> 6259.04
really

6259.25 --> 6262.329
[Music]

6275.699 --> 6283.5
oh I didn't know that iron 26 I thought

6280.02 --> 6285.139
so it's a state of Australia but it's

6283.5 --> 6288.06
also considered

6285.139 --> 6290.2390000000005
internationally a country how does that

6288.06 --> 6290.2390000000005
work

6312.54 --> 6315.54
foreign

6326.219 --> 6332.06
hey Nathan Oakley

6329.1 --> 6332.06
how are you doing man

6332.58 --> 6337.739
yeah I I uh I picked up on your Skype

6336.119 --> 6340.139
message

6337.739 --> 6343.138999999999
and I've seen your Premiere yeah I know

6340.139 --> 6346.34
you just take care man uh

6343.139 --> 6346.34
just take it easy

6352.02 --> 6357.860000000001
right if it's going to be some kind of a

6354.119 --> 6357.86
jaw operation something

6357.9 --> 6362.5199999999995
keep some colloidal silver at hand right

6360.42 --> 6366.9800000000005
this really ideal

6362.52 --> 6366.9800000000005
for the more open wound situation

6369.06 --> 6376.1
because it's really good

6372.06 --> 6376.1
for preventing infection

6382.92 --> 6387.9800000000005
foreign

6385.08 --> 6387.98
hey Adam

6392.63 --> 6395.689
[Music]

6458.219 --> 6465.3
i d equals

6461.58 --> 6470.179
AGM you mean the band

6465.3 --> 6470.179
yeah it's okay I guess

6470.94 --> 6478.259999999999
no it's just that our win in Alvin

6475.86 --> 6482.839999999999
Lord of the Rings Elven language

6478.26 --> 6482.84
literally means friend of the eagle

6484.26 --> 6487.88
it's not just a random pick

6517.36 --> 6520.509999999999
[Music]

6525.02 --> 6533.219
[Music]

6530.219 --> 6533.219
foreign

6553.219 --> 6559.5
interesting

6555.119 --> 6563.098999999999
oh wow it's so hot

6559.5 --> 6565.58
so open up a little bit of air

6563.099 --> 6565.58
oh

6584.1 --> 6590.88
[Music]

6587.78 --> 6592.92
I think I'm gonna stand outside for a

6590.88 --> 6597.679
couple of seconds and just

6592.92 --> 6597.679
take on the breeze I'll be right back

6618.84 --> 6624.42
man

6621.239 --> 6627.0599999999995
there's gonna be

6624.42 --> 6630.0
there's gonna be stuck traffic towards

6627.06 --> 6631.8
the beaches today like this weather is

6630.0 --> 6635.239
like the weather where freaking

6631.8 --> 6635.2390000000005
everybody goes to the beach

6641.76 --> 6646.679
take in the Rays well no I'm not gonna

6644.76 --> 6648.860000000001
stand in the sun when it's this warm

6646.679 --> 6648.86
thanks

6684.42 --> 6690.92
all right

6686.4 --> 6690.92
learning all kinds of things here again

6691.44 --> 6697.259999999999
a bit of Australian

6695.159 --> 6699.98
and British

6697.26 --> 6699.9800000000005
history

6706.86 --> 6711.5
statecraft anyway be back in two minutes

6798.48 --> 6801.48
you

6806.48 --> 6811.5
1606 Dutch were in Australia

6809.699 --> 6814.32
huh

6811.5 --> 6817.699
oh the Dutch did go around

6814.32 --> 6817.699
almost everywhere

6819.84 --> 6826.08
so they did get all over the place and

6822.719 --> 6830.659
they were trading and

6826.08 --> 6830.659
doing exchanges wherever they landed

6838.92 --> 6843.42
right

6841.02 --> 6845.34
and then of course there was the east

6843.42 --> 6846.599
Indian Trading company coming out of

6845.34 --> 6850.76
that

6846.599 --> 6850.76
which was predominantly Dutch

6885.92 --> 6890.46
Hawaiians are still fighting to get

6888.06 --> 6892.320000000001
their self and Country back right I

6890.46 --> 6894.3
guess that

6892.32 --> 6900.78
a why is

6894.3 --> 6903.119000000001
in sort of sort of a similar package in

6900.78 --> 6907.4
relation to the United States as New

6903.119 --> 6907.4
Zealand is towards England I guess

6910.8 --> 6915.599
it's also funny that they're both very

6913.32 --> 6918.259999999999
close to each other's

6915.599 --> 6918.26
is it

6919.8 --> 6925.26
they're almost parallel I think on the

6923.219 --> 6927.179
map

6925.26 --> 6930.38
Pacific Island

6927.179 --> 6930.38
technically right

6977.219 --> 6982.7390000000005
Texas has more people than Australia

6979.86 --> 6986.598999999999
yeah but Australia is

6982.739 --> 6986.598999999999
so much desert

6992.88 --> 6995.42
right

6996.06 --> 7001.400000000001
it's kind of tough to tell how big

6998.4 --> 7002.54
either states are in comparison to one

7001.4 --> 7005.179
another

7002.54 --> 7006.739
from the Google Map

7005.179 --> 7009.639
but

7006.739 --> 7009.638999999999
I think that

7009.98 --> 7015.739
yeah United States has like three or

7012.56 --> 7019.099
four times the amount of actual viable

7015.739 --> 7021.619
soil available than Australia

7019.099 --> 7023.179
or or more

7021.619 --> 7026.139
so of course they're going to be living

7023.179 --> 7026.139
more people there

7040.46 --> 7042.639
foreign

7066.34 --> 7073.159000000001
taxes in arid as Australia were only a

7069.679 --> 7073.159
part of it one-third

7088.099 --> 7092.78
I think that I'm not 100 sure but I

7090.679 --> 7097.219
think that climate wise

7092.78 --> 7100.46
Texas is very similar to Iran

7097.219 --> 7103.159
because Iran is also much greener than

7100.46 --> 7104.9800000000005
typical surrounding areas

7103.159 --> 7107.12
and people like

7104.98 --> 7108.379999999999
underestimate that

7107.12 --> 7111.679
[Music]

7108.38 --> 7116.4400000000005
and Texas has plenty of green

7111.679 --> 7116.4400000000005
area it's not an old desert

7127.159 --> 7134.379999999999
or am I completely wrong now let me

7131.719 --> 7134.38
see

7138.86 --> 7145.46
oh I think I was about right

7142.58 --> 7147.76
maybe more than a third maybe a half of

7145.46 --> 7147.76
Texas

7148.4 --> 7152.92
it's kind of deserty

7150.199 --> 7152.919999999999
there's a

7153.02 --> 7159.679
yeah yeah Louisiana is like fully forest

7156.679 --> 7162.619
and River lands and [ __ ]

7159.679 --> 7165.099
but a part of that area is still stuck

7162.619 --> 7165.098999999999
to Texas

7166.58 --> 7172.0599999999995
like next to Houston

7168.98 --> 7172.0599999999995
and the east side

7196.34 --> 7202.639
on the outskirts

7198.8 --> 7204.56
right yeah my co-work but that's very

7202.639 --> 7208.46
visible because

7204.56 --> 7211.06
there's still plenty of green areas at

7208.46 --> 7211.06
the coastline

7211.159 --> 7215.0199999999995
especially in Factoria

7219.5 --> 7226.28
but like every province

7222.26 --> 7228.76
or every state of Australia has green

7226.28 --> 7228.759999999999
area

7229.639 --> 7234.86
that's South Australia seems to have the

7231.92 --> 7237.6990000000005
least it's just a giant desert with a

7234.86 --> 7237.699
lot of lakes though

7246.88 --> 7253.42
yeah and that Western Australia desert

7249.98 --> 7253.419999999999
must be like insane

7255.34 --> 7259.3
that's a lot of desert

7270.699 --> 7276.5599999999995
but yeah it's even crazier to imagine

7273.38 --> 7278.719
that like in Africa North Africa

7276.56 --> 7281.780000000001
and Arabia there's just countries where

7278.719 --> 7285.76
it's all desert like desert is all they

7281.78 --> 7285.759999999999
have it's pretty remarkable

7318.56 --> 7321.56
foreign

7333.44 --> 7339.44
Ty enough resources to support the human

7336.86 --> 7341.659
population or really Pam cow so you

7339.44 --> 7344.659
think

7341.659 --> 7347.0
so by what standards like how many

7344.659 --> 7349.28
resources does it actually take to

7347.0 --> 7351.739
support a human population

7349.28 --> 7354.8
is that the total preponderance of

7351.739 --> 7357.5
resources required for the average

7354.8 --> 7359.900000000001
Metropolitan

7357.5 --> 7363.139
person

7359.9 --> 7365.659
that's like dependent on industry and

7363.139 --> 7370.400000000001
the state and everything

7365.659 --> 7373.04
or is it like an Outback guy

7370.4 --> 7375.619
that literally hunts their own food and

7373.04 --> 7378.98
cuts their own wood and builds their own

7375.619 --> 7381.679
cabins and [ __ ] like how much would they

7378.98 --> 7385.699
actually require not a lot

7381.679 --> 7388.46
right so I think that oh resources to

7385.699 --> 7392.239
support human populate yeah that's if

7388.46 --> 7395.4800000000005
everybody was a city dwelling ninny

7392.239 --> 7399.259999999999
right which need more and can do less

7395.48 --> 7402.98
right that's the problem that's real but

7399.26 --> 7405.58
that's not actually population it's more

7402.98 --> 7405.58
just

7405.619 --> 7414.32
people not living like over

7410.32 --> 7416.36
oversizing the standard of living

7414.32 --> 7418.58
I'm not saying oh that means that they

7416.36 --> 7422.86
have to then turn into third world

7418.58 --> 7422.86
conditions or anything no it's just that

7426.139 --> 7434.119
you don't really need all these things

7431.48 --> 7436.28
yeah it would make it a better standard

7434.119 --> 7438.739
of living like how important is the

7436.28 --> 7440.42
standard of living versus like your

7438.739 --> 7443.178999999999
productivity

7440.42 --> 7445.54
right how much do you really need to

7443.179 --> 7445.54
thrive

7448.94 --> 7456.5
right you can never create a world where

7452.84 --> 7458.42
everybody is gonna have like if

7456.5 --> 7461.179
like everything available to them

7458.42 --> 7464.42
whatever they want

7461.179 --> 7466.219
that's not possible then yes then if you

7464.42 --> 7468.1990000000005
would demand that of every

7466.219 --> 7470.119
person

7468.199 --> 7472.94
that they would all require that yeah

7470.119 --> 7476.92
you would have a great shortage

7472.94 --> 7476.919999999999
but that's not reality though

7481.76 --> 7486.76
in reality

7483.739 --> 7486.759999999999
if you

7490.579 --> 7495.98
cut down on Metropolitan cultural

7494.42 --> 7498.9800000000005
developments

7495.98 --> 7501.5599999999995
and instead

7498.98 --> 7503.9
give rise to more

7501.56 --> 7506.2390000000005
farming culture

7503.9 --> 7509.48
and just personal development

7506.239 --> 7511.94
Independence all that then it turns out

7509.48 --> 7514.28
that there is no overpopulation problem

7511.94 --> 7516.638999999999
there is actually an excess of food

7514.28 --> 7520.88
availability that's not gonna

7516.639 --> 7525.38
degenerate the land or drain it of water

7520.88 --> 7527.599
right that's not gonna happen then

7525.38 --> 7528.86
all that [ __ ] that environmental

7527.599 --> 7530.78
problems

7528.86 --> 7533.598999999999
water drink that all comes from

7530.78 --> 7536.0
corporate exploitation and

7533.599 --> 7537.8
and all that crap like sucking the water

7536.0 --> 7540.5
out of the ground too much so that

7537.8 --> 7542.38
everything actually starts to dry out

7540.5 --> 7545.239
or like

7542.38 --> 7546.7390000000005
ravaging entire Woods for some big

7545.239 --> 7550.04
project

7546.739 --> 7554.919999999999
instead of just cultivating it carefully

7550.04 --> 7554.92
is to keep it going to really grow wood

7555.139 --> 7560.36
all that right but most of that has been

7558.579 --> 7562.759999999999
dealt with

7560.36 --> 7565.4
because those typical problems really

7562.76 --> 7568.159000000001
came about during the industrial era

7565.4 --> 7569.96
where the robber barons remember that's

7568.159 --> 7573.199
why they call rubber bands just started

7569.96 --> 7576.9800000000005
to like do that [ __ ] cut down entire

7573.199 --> 7580.28
Woods just stuck up on their materials

7576.98 --> 7583.159
for their exploits and [ __ ]

7580.28 --> 7586.179
because it was all still legal

7583.159 --> 7586.179
to do it like that

7590.9 --> 7596.0199999999995
free to plunder at your own risk

7606.8 --> 7611.360000000001
plenty of aquifers on the earth Bible

7609.5 --> 7613.52
State Harvest will

7611.36 --> 7616.5199999999995
will be right till the end

7613.52 --> 7620.540000000001
right that's interesting

7616.52 --> 7622.099
but also yes look water is not that

7620.54 --> 7623.9
problematic with the available

7622.099 --> 7627.8
technology

7623.9 --> 7630.5
like if it would be really necessary

7627.8 --> 7634.04
you could use very basic weather

7630.5 --> 7637.52
manipulation to quickly migrate a whole

7634.04 --> 7639.38
bunch of water to a region

7637.52 --> 7641.4800000000005
right and if it's not going to come down

7639.38 --> 7644.139
in rain because it's like typically too

7641.48 --> 7647.419999999999
hot then you could still sublimate it

7644.139 --> 7649.219
technologically just bring the water in

7647.42 --> 7651.9800000000005
the air it might not fall down in rain

7649.219 --> 7654.9800000000005
but it can then be transformed into

7651.98 --> 7656.9
water technologically right there's all

7654.98 --> 7659.079
water

7656.9 --> 7659.079
foreign

7659.8 --> 7666.9800000000005
T is

7662.54 --> 7670.0
through inefficiency or on purpose

7666.98 --> 7672.98
because it's not necessary

7670.0 --> 7675.38
desalination options exactly there's so

7672.98 --> 7677.839999999999
many ways to get water

7675.38 --> 7680.4800000000005
so if there's gonna be some kind of a

7677.84 --> 7682.88
drought or like over and sucking the

7680.48 --> 7686.0
water out of the ground it's because of

7682.88 --> 7689.659000000001
greed and exploitation

7686.0 --> 7693.079
against yeah against nature

7689.659 --> 7695.719
rubber Baron activity right

7693.079 --> 7698.299999999999
if you create if you like oh if you take

7695.719 --> 7701.0
away availability of things there will

7698.3 --> 7704.179
be more need and then you can manipulate

7701.0 --> 7707.42
these people to give you more because

7704.179 --> 7710.42
they need it so bad right that's Robber

7707.42 --> 7713.4800000000005
Baron tactics that's what they have done

7710.42 --> 7715.96
a lot they're still doing it

7713.48 --> 7719.54
if you look at what's actually available

7715.96 --> 7723.02
technological wise and information wise

7719.54 --> 7725.42
there is no problem for overpopulation

7723.02 --> 7728.96
at all

7725.42 --> 7733.2390000000005
it's like getting more population is not

7728.96 --> 7733.2390000000005
gonna turn down and destroy

7733.4 --> 7738.86
nature it doesn't have to that only

7737.06 --> 7743.26
happens

7738.86 --> 7746.48
if it's used satanically to black male

7743.26 --> 7749.3
all the world's population

7746.48 --> 7750.379999999999
like they might literally just destroy

7749.3 --> 7753.4400000000005
it

7750.38 --> 7755.78
big like famous pieces of nature just to

7753.44 --> 7759.44
say it's because you thought you were

7755.78 --> 7761.42
free so now we destroy it literally

7759.44 --> 7764.659
destroy it

7761.42 --> 7767.179
and we're gonna blame you right

7764.659 --> 7769.82
that's the only way

7767.179 --> 7771.619
real things are even lost anymore in

7769.82 --> 7773.42
this world it's because they literally

7771.619 --> 7776.78
sacrifice it

7773.42 --> 7778.4
the Mind Control you into guilt and

7776.78 --> 7781.719
self-destruction

7778.4 --> 7781.719
pure satanic

7782.3 --> 7785.84
because nothing needs to be lost like

7785.0 --> 7788.36
that

7785.84 --> 7791.84
it really doesn't it's only done

7788.36 --> 7793.94
satanically to reinforce the myth that

7791.84 --> 7796.719
people are bad and a burden and we

7793.94 --> 7799.94
should be kept down in our numbers

7796.719 --> 7802.699
actively even though that has all kinds

7799.94 --> 7805.879999999999
of unforeseen side effects like if

7802.699 --> 7808.5199999999995
successful complete societal collapse

7805.88 --> 7811.04
extravagance

7808.52 --> 7813.26
or if it's not successful actually

7811.04 --> 7816.079
causing the population that's being

7813.26 --> 7819.92
subjected to it to become even more

7816.079 --> 7821.42
replicating explosively right so it

7819.92 --> 7824.599
never works

7821.42 --> 7827.84
for what they say it should do ever it's

7824.599 --> 7830.54
only damage damage damage damage more

7827.84 --> 7833.38
damage more time you need to recover

7830.54 --> 7835.88
so they do

7833.38 --> 7838.400000000001
overpopulation Eugenics what they're

7835.88 --> 7842.06
doing with it is a nightmare and it is

7838.4 --> 7844.04
completely contradictory to the original

7842.06 --> 7845.84
idea

7844.04 --> 7849.099
I think

7845.84 --> 7852.079
the original eugenics

7849.099 --> 7854.179
maybe just a tiny part of it is just all

7852.079 --> 7856.5199999999995
about balance with nature and just be

7854.179 --> 7858.26
realistic and

7856.52 --> 7861.76
balance

7858.26 --> 7861.76
Natural Balance

7862.219 --> 7866.78
it's not about uh kill as many as

7864.5 --> 7869.599
possible or they'll just grow and

7866.78 --> 7871.579
outgrow us and to overtake the power and

7869.599 --> 7873.4400000000005
then everything will be destroyed now

7871.579 --> 7875.98
everything is destroyed because you are

7873.44 --> 7878.54
in power and you are destroying things

7875.98 --> 7880.28
specifically to try and blackmail the

7878.54 --> 7883.42
Free People

7880.28 --> 7883.42
pieces of [ __ ]

7897.079 --> 7899.799999999999
right

7900.5 --> 7906.32
that's what they do oh there's pollution

7902.84 --> 7909.1990000000005
oh that can be immediately stopped as

7906.32 --> 7910.88
soon as discovered immediately it's not

7909.199 --> 7914.299999999999
being stopped oh there's a wall of

7910.88 --> 7917.4400000000005
bureaucracy or uh laziness or

7914.3 --> 7917.4400000000005
whatever yeah

7919.28 --> 7924.44
but yeah so the pollution just keeps

7922.04 --> 7927.0199999999995
going like the industrial pollution or

7924.44 --> 7929.839999999999
that just don't don't do anything about

7927.02 --> 7933.040000000001
that just wall of bureaucracy but at the

7929.84 --> 7934.82
same time top down oh oh the world is

7933.04 --> 7938.06
damaging

7934.82 --> 7939.619
oh look that's your fault person in a

7938.06 --> 7942.92
house having a normal life trying to

7939.619 --> 7945.199
have a sensible life and family and kid

7942.92 --> 7947.84
now that's your fault it's not the

7945.199 --> 7951.5599999999995
[ __ ] people in government not doing

7947.84 --> 7954.679
anything about toxic spills and [ __ ]

7951.56 --> 7956.54
no it's your problem because you wanted

7954.679 --> 7958.82
to have kids

7956.54 --> 7960.86
yeah that's what they do

7958.82 --> 7964.299999999999
even though they can actually fix

7960.86 --> 7964.299999999999
environmental issues

7966.86 --> 7974.119
I know they keep been around to

7969.76 --> 7977.119000000001
Blackmail you with into guilt spiraling

7974.119 --> 7978.0199999999995
that you're the cause for the damage not

7977.119 --> 7979.639
them

7978.02 --> 7981.4400000000005
that's what they want to do that's what

7979.639 --> 7983.119
they have been doing

7981.44 --> 7985.28
for as far as I can remember it's

7983.119 --> 7988.88
governments that are even slightly

7985.28 --> 7991.4
corrupt that typically end up doing that

7988.88 --> 7993.86
they might not even have intended doing

7991.4 --> 7996.32
that at first but just because of their

7993.86 --> 7997.88
habits as like no we're not gonna do

7996.32 --> 8000.219
anything about it because it costs too

7997.88 --> 8003.04
much or we don't really care we're

8000.219 --> 8006.28
focusing on some political project yeah

8003.04 --> 8008.679
then that's the result you end up with

8006.28 --> 8011.5599999999995
you're literally keeping damage around

8008.679 --> 8014.26
and then through propaganda

8011.56 --> 8016.900000000001
make people feel guilty because it's

8014.26 --> 8019.4800000000005
their fault supposedly even though

8016.9 --> 8021.5199999999995
you're in government not actually doing

8019.48 --> 8024.178999999999
anything about the problem that's really

8021.52 --> 8024.179
the problem

8033.599 --> 8041.679
right polluting ground is real problems

8038.079 --> 8044.92
polluting ground is what causes the soil

8041.679 --> 8048.219
to die to become not fertile to not be

8044.92 --> 8049.9
usable to cultivate food for or other

8048.219 --> 8052.659
things

8049.9 --> 8055.48
right that's the problem that's a

8052.659 --> 8058.54
problem that will actually churn down on

8055.48 --> 8060.959999999999
the available resources

8058.54 --> 8060.96
right

8061.06 --> 8067.0
so the pollution of ground

8064.9 --> 8069.159
that's the thing that should be really

8067.0 --> 8071.88
guarded against and and pollution of

8069.159 --> 8071.879999999999
ground and water

8072.52 --> 8078.599
like that should be responded to very

8075.28 --> 8080.5599999999995
quickly and decisively to prevent

8078.599 --> 8083.619000000001
cascading

8080.56 --> 8085.4800000000005
and long-term damage because that is the

8083.619 --> 8089.38
real long-term damage

8085.48 --> 8091.0
that makes living more difficult

8089.38 --> 8094.0
not you

8091.0 --> 8097.54
just wanting to live a normal moral life

8094.0 --> 8100.96
have kids and all that

8097.54 --> 8102.83
anyway just want to make that specific

8100.96 --> 8106.0
point

8102.83 --> 8106.0
[Music]

8111.62 --> 8119.05
[Music]

8119.739 --> 8121.919999999999
foreign

8137.139 --> 8141.579
I have an f8 that's a that's funny

8139.54 --> 8143.139
that's a pretty interesting and funny

8141.579 --> 8144.699
statement the only difference between

8143.139 --> 8146.5
the mob and government is that

8144.699 --> 8149.619
government can pass laws to protect

8146.5 --> 8153.28
their money collection Enterprises and

8149.619 --> 8154.598999999999
the mob is organized I love that

8153.28 --> 8158.139
because you're implying yeah the

8154.599 --> 8161.860000000001
government is not that organized it's an

8158.139 --> 8165.099
organization but is it really organized

8161.86 --> 8167.32
well that's actually kind of rare

8165.099 --> 8170.02
most governments are not really that

8167.32 --> 8171.639
well organized they're they're just

8170.02 --> 8176.099
barely

8171.639 --> 8176.099
holding on to being functional

8176.38 --> 8181.659000000001
right the more government organization

8179.139 --> 8184.84
you have the more dysfunctional it

8181.659 --> 8186.098999999999
becomes just like

8184.84 --> 8190.4800000000005
with

8186.099 --> 8192.939
computer programs or yeah

8190.48 --> 8196.479
the bigger they come become

8192.939 --> 8199.26
the more errors and problems will come

8196.479 --> 8202.779999999999
the bigger the preponderance of code is

8199.26 --> 8203.559000000001
the more tough it becomes to organize it

8202.78 --> 8206.26
all

8203.559 --> 8208.599
and it becomes inefficient

8206.26 --> 8209.92
in the overall process right and the

8208.599 --> 8212.74
same goes for government like

8209.92 --> 8214.24
governments should be simple very very

8212.74 --> 8216.76
simple

8214.24 --> 8219.039999999999
and then it is really effective it

8216.76 --> 8221.28
becomes harder to corrupt

8219.04 --> 8224.559000000001
things don't get snowed under

8221.28 --> 8227.319000000001
bureaucracy like that

8224.559 --> 8229.059
if it's big yeah it will always start

8227.319 --> 8230.92
happening there will always be people in

8229.059 --> 8233.259999999998
God it's really big you'll always be

8230.92 --> 8235.84
people that will just use the size of

8233.26 --> 8237.939
the government to say ah [ __ ] it I'm

8235.84 --> 8240.04
just gonna put it on the

8237.939 --> 8241.719000000001
on the waiting list

8240.04 --> 8244.719000000001
indefinitely

8241.719 --> 8247.66
right that can only happen if the

8244.719 --> 8250.0
government is really big

8247.66 --> 8251.319
because it can get drowned it can live

8250.0 --> 8253.42
like have

8251.319 --> 8255.219
a thousand desk workers that'll just

8253.42 --> 8257.2
tell you every time now just call this

8255.219 --> 8259.419999999998
person and then that person picks up no

8257.2 --> 8262.12
call that person like that

8259.42 --> 8263.019
forever like that's because of big

8262.12 --> 8265.059000000001
government

8263.019 --> 8267.639000000001
it's not a big government yeah who are

8265.059 --> 8269.679
you gonna call next no the one

8267.639 --> 8271.179
responsible is the one responsible and

8269.679 --> 8273.34
that will be the one that will be the

8271.179 --> 8274.899
Target and you can't just move it on to

8273.34 --> 8277.899
a thousand other people

8274.899 --> 8280.26
right it's very pragmatic practical

8277.899 --> 8280.26
difference

8283.479 --> 8288.938999999998
right also makes the sheriff system in

8287.019 --> 8290.74
the United States very efficient because

8288.939 --> 8293.859
it is

8290.74 --> 8296.619999999999
just that sheriff

8293.859 --> 8300.58
so by Nature it is not a huge

8296.62 --> 8304.859
bureaucracy it's that one individual

8300.58 --> 8304.859
that makes it much more effective

8305.2 --> 8311.58
for governmental function

8307.479 --> 8311.58
small government is more effective

8311.74 --> 8314.34
anyway

8330.34 --> 8336.54
yes here we go again yeah fines are just

8333.34 --> 8336.54
big business expense

8336.7 --> 8341.979000000001
if a company is not like people are not

8339.58 --> 8344.62
arrested in it

8341.979 --> 8346.84
put in jail they can't get away with

8344.62 --> 8349.179
fines then that's simply

8346.84 --> 8353.08
to Big Business

8349.179 --> 8355.359
it's seen as tax that they cannot avoid

8353.08 --> 8358.24
that's how they see fines from

8355.359 --> 8360.7
government they see it as taxes that

8358.24 --> 8362.76
cannot be avoided

8360.7 --> 8366.099
they don't even see it as punishment

8362.76 --> 8368.74
punishment only really comes around the

8366.099 --> 8372.219000000001
corner for big corporations when people

8368.74 --> 8374.8
are actually getting arrested

8372.219 --> 8377.38
then it gets serious if it's just fines

8374.8 --> 8379.179
who gives a [ __ ] Mega corporations have

8377.38 --> 8382.539999999999
so much money coming out of their asses

8379.179 --> 8384.219000000001
it's just like a toll

8382.54 --> 8387.580000000002
finds

8384.219 --> 8389.74
right and hey if this number just seems

8387.58 --> 8391.84
really high to an individual like oh

8389.74 --> 8394.06
they had to pay

8391.84 --> 8396.22
600 million

8394.06 --> 8398.68
that seems like an individual like oh my

8396.22 --> 8401.8
God that's so much well Mega Corporation

8398.68 --> 8404.460000000001
it's just like okay that's like a ten

8401.8 --> 8404.46
dollar fine

8404.68 --> 8409.66
to them to it

8407.62 --> 8412.060000000001
it's nothing but if it seems really

8409.66 --> 8415.24
large then there is a

8412.06 --> 8417.399
and influence It's like because it seems
