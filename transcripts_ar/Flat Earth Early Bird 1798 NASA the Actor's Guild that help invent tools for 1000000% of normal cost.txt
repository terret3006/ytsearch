[Music]

229.72 --> 235.48

243.079 --> 251.92000000000002
today oh it was right after qwi

248.2 --> 254.879
live right yeah what am I talking about

251.92 --> 254.879
the treatment was

258.44 --> 265.08
Monday Monday

260.639 --> 265.08
night what kep me up so late I don't

266.72 --> 271.03900000000004
remember right I I did watch pretty

269.8 --> 273.759
silly

271.039 --> 277.4
movie I recognized

273.759 --> 281.28000000000003
it like after 15 minutes I think I might

277.4 --> 285.12
have yeah I recognize what it

281.28 --> 285.11999999999995
was it's completely

285.36 --> 290.199
ridiculous

288.24 --> 292.039
predestination I think it's like James

290.199 --> 297.08000000000004
Franco is in there or something and it

292.039 --> 297.08
is really like just a crazy

298.56 --> 301.56
movie

307.919 --> 314.0
but I mean it is it's also pretty stupid

311.479 --> 317.08
in ways like it was interesting enough

314.0 --> 319.759
but still yeah I don't know if anybody

317.08 --> 320.75899999999996
like you any of you have actually seen

319.759 --> 324.319
that

320.759 --> 327.16
movie it's basically about a guy

324.319 --> 332.16
that's born a

327.16 --> 335.52000000000004
girl and that's in some temporal agency

332.16 --> 339.52000000000004
and trapping himself in a loop or

335.52 --> 342.75899999999996
something but it's

339.52 --> 345.71999999999997
like it's just

342.759 --> 347.52000000000004
ridiculous I don't want to spoil it but

345.72 --> 349.44000000000005
I mean if you're going to watch it

347.52 --> 353.4
you're going to catch on to like oh

349.44 --> 353.4
there's something really weird going on

353.96 --> 358.479
here

355.29 --> 360.319
[Music]

358.479 --> 364.56
h

360.319 --> 368.52000000000004
he's Arwin I've heard of it i' have

364.56 --> 371.61
heard and seen trailer of it years ago

368.52 --> 371.60999999999996
[Music]

372.12 --> 379.919
right hey steamy traveler good to see

374.639 --> 379.919
you fee late edition yeah kind

382.16 --> 386.59900000000005
of it wasn't a treatment

388.4 --> 391.4
yeah

393.28 --> 398.44
what kept me up so

395.0 --> 401.16
bad it was oh Benjamin pretty long

398.44 --> 403.12
stream and then I yeah then it's this

401.16 --> 404.199
movie I watched this movie and that kept

403.12 --> 406.88
me

404.199 --> 408.599
up it wasn't the treatment what am I

406.88 --> 410.52
talking about we're still going to blame

408.599 --> 413.44
Qi though all these late night

410.52 --> 415.24
treatments is like shifting my night

413.44 --> 418.4
Rhythm

415.24 --> 421.40000000000003
[Music]

418.4 --> 421.4
ah

434.16 --> 437.879
looks like here is doing good things for

437.039 --> 441.87899999999996
like

437.879 --> 441.879
what what is he doing b

442.72 --> 447.319
n I haven't seen him do

448.319 --> 455.47900000000004
anything

450.96 --> 458.4
like yeah he got the biggest vote

455.479 --> 460.87899999999996
count and then

458.4 --> 463.56
what I haven't heard of a single thing

460.879 --> 465.96000000000004
he's actually done since then so what

463.56 --> 465.96
did he

472.759 --> 481.84000000000003
do oh the new said he's oh okay

477.919 --> 486.31899999999996
well that's like

481.84 --> 489.52
the that's like the party line thing but

486.319 --> 492.44
is what is is he doing it how is he

489.52 --> 495.0
doing that when he can't even form a

492.44 --> 497.479
parliament because all the other cartel

495.0 --> 500.12
parties are boycotting him so how is he

497.479 --> 500.12
doing that

501.02 --> 511.24
[Music]

508.24 --> 511.24
exactly

512.0 --> 518.279
I'm sure he wants to stop this foreign

514.32 --> 518.279
Invasion but how is he doing

526.44 --> 530.5600000000001
that he vow to

530.76 --> 536.56
yeah he's also a great friend of Israel

534.36 --> 540.839
by the way don't know if you realize

536.56 --> 544.279
that don't know how my government works

540.839 --> 548.0400000000001
I don't think anybody know how it

544.279 --> 548.04
works cuz it doesn't

558.399 --> 563.519
work he didn't know he was a fan of

560.64 --> 566.4399999999999
Israel yeah just like that guy in

563.519 --> 566.44
Argentina that

568.12 --> 571.12
one

573.48 --> 581.48
so to me it's all suspicious

577.32 --> 586.0790000000001
like does any government work

581.48 --> 586.0790000000001
yeah definitely governments can

591.2 --> 596.88
work problem is they they get corrupted

594.36 --> 599.8000000000001
there's just this system out

596.88 --> 602.12
there a group of

599.8 --> 605.959
people and their

602.12 --> 608.48
ideologies that like if a government

605.959 --> 611.76
actually functions they attack

608.48 --> 614.12
it until they've broken it down and

611.76 --> 618.24
infiltrated it and then it stops

614.12 --> 618.24
functioning and then they stop attacking

619.24 --> 623.76
it that's what's really going on out

628.04 --> 635.899
there

630.3 --> 635.899
[Music]

637.0 --> 641.56
right I mean this is what they do oh

639.279 --> 645.6
this damn government they cracked down

641.56 --> 649.56
they censored oh they were needlessly

645.6 --> 652.24
aggressive so then yeah they get taken

649.56 --> 653.88
down and replaced and guess what The

652.24 --> 655.399
Replacements

653.88 --> 660.2
doing

655.399 --> 662.959
suppressing and roughly treating people

660.2 --> 664.839
oh that exact thing that the previous

662.959 --> 667.5999999999999
government was being taken down for even

664.839 --> 669.8800000000001
though they technically didn't do that

667.6 --> 672.6800000000001
it was just nitpicking

669.88 --> 674.12
again but now with the replacement

672.68 --> 675.88
government they're going to do it

674.12 --> 679.24
standard

675.88 --> 682.24
Fair yeah the thing they took the

679.24 --> 684.8
previous government down for is going to

682.24 --> 687.9590000000001
be the thing that they are going to

684.8 --> 690.959
standardize that's how it

687.959 --> 690.959
works

699.74 --> 702.94
[Music]

706.959 --> 714.5189999999999
right cuz their tactic is oh find the

710.72 --> 717.36
thing that get people red up enough to

714.519 --> 719.6
abandon their own when they found that

717.36 --> 722.9590000000001
thing then they make a govern that

719.6 --> 724.88
exclusively dulls out that thing so that

722.959 --> 728.04
they can keep the people like in an

724.88 --> 728.04
agitated State

746.24 --> 751.199
[Music]

747.88 --> 755.16
forever because that's what they do

751.199 --> 757.3599999999999
now hello Tommy and or wumble good to

755.16 --> 757.36
see

777.839 --> 780.839
you

782.48 --> 791.6
corruption is human nature no no it

787.04 --> 791.5999999999999
isn't corruption is a character

791.76 --> 797.519
thing corruption definitely is not in

794.839 --> 801.0
human nature not per

797.519 --> 801.0
default that's not

804.36 --> 812.0790000000001
true right yeah any person with if you

809.24 --> 814.44
amp up the power level the risk of

812.079 --> 817.519
corruption becomes higher but that is

814.44 --> 819.2790000000001
not in their nature it's not like oh as

817.519 --> 821.48
soon as they reach that critical mass

819.279 --> 822.68
they immediately corrupt it's not what

821.48 --> 826.48
they long

822.68 --> 830.199
for there's people that long for the

826.48 --> 833.24
power they long for the corruption they

830.199 --> 837.7199999999999
long for the power abuse that's not

833.24 --> 837.72
common it's not a common human

837.759 --> 840.759
nature

842.48 --> 846.36
yeah and even if given too much

848.92 --> 854.519
power what usually happens to people

851.44 --> 857.9590000000001
that are given too much power is that

854.519 --> 860.68
they they create a Ruckus or an accident

857.959 --> 863.5999999999999
they exert Power by accident because

860.68 --> 867.16
somebody enrages them or something and

863.6 --> 870.6800000000001
then they become afraid of their own

867.16 --> 872.959
power and then they want to like lay it

870.68 --> 877.079
down they want to walk away that's

872.959 --> 877.079
actually what happens to most

880.72 --> 886.88
people when they get too much

884.079 --> 888.5999999999999
power they got more power than they're

886.88 --> 891.32
comfortable

888.6 --> 894.0
with they then they can wield properly

891.32 --> 897.36
then they can be responsible

894.0 --> 899.519
for yeah you don't then just grow up not

897.36 --> 902.399
every freaking person in the world is

899.519 --> 903.92
just waiting to become the ultimate

902.399 --> 906.399
power

903.92 --> 909.3199999999999
person that can just do whatever they

906.399 --> 913.8
want and like torture people or

909.32 --> 913.8000000000001
something no

927.6 --> 930.6
no

936.759 --> 941.399
but I mean ter even NASA technically is

940.199 --> 944.5999999999999
it

941.399 --> 948.0
corrupt or are they doing

944.6 --> 953.0400000000001
exactly what they were tasked to

948.0 --> 953.04
do and we just don't agree with

957.6 --> 960.6
it

961.279 --> 965.56
cuz I see NASA kind of like a theater

971.8 --> 978.0
organization it's just really bizarre

974.199 --> 980.88
that actual governments would like lean

978.0 --> 983.8
on a theater

980.88 --> 986.639
Organization for evidence that's the

983.8 --> 986.639
crazy part

987.519 --> 990.519
really

992.519 --> 998.759
but I mean that's yeah that's what they

994.839 --> 998.759
were there for that's what it was made

999.759 --> 1006.9590000000001
for it's what they do it's not about

1003.0 --> 1009.88
freaking rockets and space it's about

1006.959 --> 1010.7199999999999
what do you do to make everybody believe

1009.88 --> 1014.6
in

1010.72 --> 1014.6
space that's all it

1015.36 --> 1023.44
is they don't give a [Â __Â ]

1019.959 --> 1027.3999999999999
about anything else and they play around

1023.44 --> 1027.4
with it too it's all

1035.199 --> 1040.8390000000002
weird or in that sense you could say

1037.6 --> 1042.9189999999999
that NASA itself based on its actual

1040.839 --> 1047.079
function has become

1042.919 --> 1047.0790000000002
corrupted because they're just [Â __Â ]

1047.4 --> 1054.3200000000002
around and they're like doing weird mind

1051.36 --> 1056.9599999999998
trickery with incompetent Graphics but

1054.32 --> 1060.12
that's just when you just think about

1056.96 --> 1062.96
okay it's an agency it's there to fake

1060.12 --> 1065.1999999999998
space and make everybody believe in it

1062.96 --> 1071.08
is it doing a good

1065.2 --> 1073.3600000000001
job well no it isn't it's terrible they

1071.08 --> 1077.1589999999999
should have updated the graphics like

1073.36 --> 1079.24
enormously and all that and just did a

1077.159 --> 1081.64
freaking better job and stop wasting

1079.24 --> 1085.36
everybody's time so much and also like

1081.64 --> 1088.72
Do Better Think Tank work behind the

1085.36 --> 1092.0
scenes so you have better responses to

1088.72 --> 1094.52
questions you [Â __Â ] retards with your

1092.0 --> 1098.039
50-year

1094.52 --> 1100.039
outdated responses like you're [Â __Â ]

1098.039 --> 1103.36
literally

1100.039 --> 1105.44
outdated it's all stupid it's

1103.36 --> 1107.1999999999998
dysfunctional and in that sense it is

1105.44 --> 1109.6000000000001
corrupt they're getting giant amounts of

1107.2 --> 1112.32
money to basically just fool around and

1109.6 --> 1116.039
screw it up and everybody's just letting

1112.32 --> 1118.08
that happen nobody's like getting in

1116.039 --> 1119.52
there and like okay you guys are

1118.08 --> 1122.1999999999998
screwing it

1119.52 --> 1123.84
up we're going to do it differently now

1122.2 --> 1126.64
no

1123.84 --> 1129.799
nothing so it's like corrupted and

1126.64 --> 1134.8400000000001
they're just leaving it to to

1129.799 --> 1134.84
Fester just keep going nobody

1137.32 --> 1140.32
cares

1144.799 --> 1149.559
they don't make stuff right no they

1146.559 --> 1149.559
don't make stuff for

1151.36 --> 1158.6399999999999
us they're sometimes astronauts serve as

1155.12 --> 1162.6789999999999
like industrial salesmen so where

1158.64 --> 1165.64
somebody clearly on Earth developed some

1162.679 --> 1168.3200000000002
technology that was supposedly involved

1165.64 --> 1170.159
with space stuff and then some

1168.32 --> 1172.2
astronaut's going to brag about oh look

1170.159 --> 1175.5590000000002
at this new tech that we helped develop

1172.2 --> 1176.679
they didn't do [Â __Â ] it's just a [Â __Â ]

1175.559 --> 1179.9189999999999
theater

1176.679 --> 1183.6000000000001
idiot in high

1179.919 --> 1188.8400000000001
wires pretending they're in space being

1183.6 --> 1188.84
salesman of Industrial Products I

1189.4 --> 1192.72
mean it's

1197.24 --> 1202.159
[Â __Â ] they're not even doing a good

1199.679 --> 1202.159
sales

1227.159 --> 1234.2800000000002
job

1229.799 --> 1234.28
the asteroid Landing I forgot about that

1235.2 --> 1241.6000000000001
nonsense

1236.72 --> 1241.6000000000001
2013 Mars Landing conference

1245.76 --> 1251.08
what is that like the helicopter thingy

1249.159 --> 1252.96
no that was later right I don't know I

1251.08 --> 1255.0
don't keep track of all the supposed

1252.96 --> 1260.1200000000001
activity they

1255.0 --> 1260.12
do memory pH okay

1263.52 --> 1266.6399999999999
what does that have to do with

1275.679 --> 1280.8400000000001
anything Tom what are you doing what are

1278.279 --> 1285.64
you saying Tommy are you saying they all

1280.84 --> 1289.84
invented that nonsense can you prove

1285.64 --> 1293.5200000000002
that can you actually prove that

1289.84 --> 1298.6399999999999
that yeah I want to see the

1293.52 --> 1302.8799999999999
log of the astronaut who developed that

1298.64 --> 1305.5200000000002
technology in space I want to see how he

1302.88 --> 1307.6000000000001
developed that in space with camera

1305.52 --> 1310.8799999999999
footage of what he was doing how he was

1307.6 --> 1317.039
assembling everything yeah in order to

1310.88 --> 1318.72
invent that [Â __Â ] then okay

1317.039 --> 1323.32
yeah

1318.72 --> 1323.32
otherwise stop spouting

1323.88 --> 1332.3600000000001
nonsense there is no space you can't

1327.559 --> 1332.36
freaking engineer anything in space it's

1336.4 --> 1344.039
horeshit yeah Bill night de that's

1339.64 --> 1346.96
right 62 million a day I could could get

1344.039 --> 1348.72
incredible things

1346.96 --> 1352.0
engineered

1348.72 --> 1355.279
including a zero g simulator that's like

1352.0 --> 1357.679
perfect and completely outdates the

1355.279 --> 1357.679
vomit

1369.4 --> 1376.0800000000002
Comet those are invented by that yeah so

1372.559 --> 1376.08
it's complete hor [Â __Â ]

1376.96 --> 1384.96
then it's just a lot of money and the

1380.4 --> 1387.88
money had been spent on development of

1384.96 --> 1391.919
non-space related

1387.88 --> 1394.0800000000002
things so it's just a giant budget for a

1391.919 --> 1398.3200000000002
bunch of Workshop guys that are just

1394.08 --> 1398.32
like okay well then let's just invent

1399.44 --> 1405.48
stuff you know you could just invent

1402.679 --> 1408.76
stuff with your own

1405.48 --> 1414.159
budget people actually do that and it's

1408.76 --> 1414.1589999999999
like thousands of times cheaper

1431.24 --> 1439.88
too and for space experiment forget I

1435.2 --> 1439.88
just remember the space coffee teret

1440.039 --> 1445.559
right that they recycle from toilet

1442.52 --> 1446.65
water literally that's what he said

1445.559 --> 1449.699
space

1446.65 --> 1449.699
[Music]

1451.32 --> 1456.52
coffee yeah keep yapping akumu virus

1454.559 --> 1458.84
none of that [Â __Â ] has anything to do

1456.52 --> 1462.1589999999999
really with

1458.84 --> 1465.1589999999999
NASA it's corporate

1462.159 --> 1465.159
socialism

1465.679 --> 1473.72
yeah stupid space

1468.52 --> 1476.36
stories government gives colossal

1473.72 --> 1479.48
budget and people approve because of

1476.36 --> 1483.1999999999998
stupid space stories then colossal

1479.48 --> 1485.64
budget is basically just being wasted on

1483.2 --> 1489.3600000000001
kind of like nonsense corporate

1485.64 --> 1493.039
socialism inventing stuff way too

1489.36 --> 1495.6789999999999
expensive not super effective could be

1493.039 --> 1498.64
done like thousands of times cheaper by

1495.679 --> 1501.48
an individual that's just professionally

1498.64 --> 1505.48
trying to invent things

1501.48 --> 1508.76
yeah that's how [Â __Â ] useful NASA is

1505.48 --> 1512.08
it's mostly good at wasting tons and

1508.76 --> 1514.399
tons and tons of your money that's what

1512.08 --> 1517.52
it's really good

1514.399 --> 1521.0
at and you get these stupid trinket

1517.52 --> 1524.679
memories of what they supposedly

1521.0 --> 1526.96
made right so put all the inventions

1524.679 --> 1530.5590000000002
that you remember they've supposedly

1526.96 --> 1535.44
been respons for making next to one

1530.559 --> 1538.52
another and then add all the budget of

1535.44 --> 1541.96
NASA that they've ever

1538.52 --> 1545.279
received and then see if the

1541.96 --> 1549.039
price kind of evens out if that evens

1545.279 --> 1551.12
out the amount of inventions or if it's

1549.039 --> 1553.6
blatantly

1551.12 --> 1556.6789999999999
ridiculous is barely you could barely

1553.6 --> 1559.4399999999998
even call those inventions consolidation

1556.679 --> 1561.96
prizes

1559.44 --> 1564.679
because they're like

1561.96 --> 1567.96
100,000th worth the amount of money that

1564.679 --> 1567.96
was wasted

1568.72 --> 1574.08
yeah does the Netherlands have a space

1571.36 --> 1578.9599999999998
agency I don't know we I think we got

1574.08 --> 1581.8799999999999
like one of those ISS pools or something

1578.96 --> 1585.3990000000001
here I think we got like an ISS pool in

1581.88 --> 1587.3990000000001
Z for or something I don't know for sure

1585.399 --> 1588.279
we're definitely cooperating with that

1587.399 --> 1590.799
number

1588.279 --> 1593.36
nonsense we're definitely pretending

1590.799 --> 1596.279
like we're also we're also one of the SP

1593.36 --> 1596.279
guys

1596.32 --> 1603.279
so but I mean the budget is not as

1599.44 --> 1603.279
ridiculous as in the United

1606.8 --> 1609.8899999999999
[Music]

1616.6 --> 1620.52
States

1618.96 --> 1623.3600000000001
dude what the [Â __Â ] is up with all these

1620.52 --> 1623.36
ballers in my

1624.559 --> 1629.84
chat what are you whining about space

1634.46 --> 1640.3600000000001
[Music]

1636.76 --> 1643.559
agencies all that we know is space is

1640.36 --> 1646.1999999999998
fake you can't get there relative

1643.559 --> 1649.96
density disequilibrium Force never ends

1646.2 --> 1649.96
it only gets greater as you go

1650.52 --> 1657.48
up there's no other places you can land

1655.12 --> 1658.84
on that are not directly connected to

1657.48 --> 1663.799
this

1658.84 --> 1665.9599999999998
place and space agencies are the most

1663.799 --> 1670.36
money

1665.96 --> 1670.3600000000001
wasting agency that's ever been

1675.0 --> 1681.399
created it's almost like NASA is

1678.039 --> 1683.48
specifically created to kind of like

1681.399 --> 1686.2399999999998
bankrupt the banking

1683.48 --> 1688.3990000000001
system I'm thinking about it like that

1686.24 --> 1692.6
what if NASA is purely

1688.399 --> 1696.5189999999998
creating is is created to hasten the

1692.6 --> 1696.519
downfall through economic

1697.6 --> 1705.1589999999999
depletion what if it is just

1701.679 --> 1708.44
that it's like a socialist parasite

1705.159 --> 1711.3990000000001
organ that's just there to parasite of

1708.44 --> 1715.3200000000002
the delusion of people and make

1711.399 --> 1715.32
everybody broke more

1721.399 --> 1726.6399999999999
quickly yeah Thor Casey I don't care

1724.64 --> 1729.44
this just could you just stop whining

1726.64 --> 1731.919
about [Â __Â ] astronauts especially

1729.44 --> 1735.2
Dutch ones I don't give a [Â __Â ] it's

1731.919 --> 1735.2
embarrassing enough as it

1736.399 --> 1739.399
is

1750.559 --> 1754.32
Department of Education yeah they're all

1752.279 --> 1759.399
terrible woodworking gy

1754.32 --> 1761.48
bear they're all terrible and corrupt

1759.399 --> 1765.4399999999998
and

1761.48 --> 1769.32
corporate not of the people but I mean

1765.44 --> 1769.3200000000002
NASA wastes more money

1769.64 --> 1774.88
though I think the only thing that

1772.12 --> 1777.36
actually costs more money to the US is

1774.88 --> 1780.0
like the military

1777.36 --> 1784.6
Department who waste so much money like

1780.0 --> 1784.6
nobody even understands what's what

1784.72 --> 1789.88
happens it's just so freaking much

1795.0 --> 1804.919
money I mean US military probably the

1799.88 --> 1807.88
biggest like corporate socialist system

1804.919 --> 1811.3200000000002
the world has ever

1807.88 --> 1813.0390000000002
seen just insane amounts of money and

1811.32 --> 1815.799
like you don't even know what's

1813.039 --> 1815.799
happening with

1816.399 --> 1823.0
that and they are

1820.12 --> 1824.8799999999999
corporations military corporations like

1823.0 --> 1827.399
yeah the government is the government

1824.88 --> 1829.0
the military arm of the government but

1827.399 --> 1830.9189999999999
those corporations they're all just

1829.0 --> 1835.36
corporations and they're and they're

1830.919 --> 1839.0800000000002
being fed like the the biggest amount of

1835.36 --> 1839.08
money has ever been

1839.76 --> 1845.48
seen and you and what did they even give

1842.6 --> 1845.48
back for it you

1846.6 --> 1850.039
know at this

1850.88 --> 1855.96
point they're certainly not giving back

1853.2 --> 1858.039
any quality soldiers since they all had

1855.96 --> 1861.08
to get faxes

1858.039 --> 1865.48
and and been promoting like [Â __Â ] in

1861.08 --> 1867.12
the military for like a year or so so

1865.48 --> 1868.519
yeah what are you getting back for all

1867.12 --> 1871.799
that money

1868.519 --> 1875.0
huh it's all just money dump all of it

1871.799 --> 1877.36
it's all just like yeah just when can

1875.0 --> 1879.639
this Bank find like when can the US

1877.36 --> 1884.08

1879.639 --> 1885.8799999999999
like full gas like we want to crash this

1884.08 --> 1890.72
wall as

1885.88 --> 1893.3990000000001
hard as possible like as un as hard as

1890.72 --> 1896.519
universally possible crash in this wall

1893.399 --> 1896.5189999999998
that's what they're all doing

1910.679 --> 1914.48
together what the hell are you whining

1912.76 --> 1916.799
about

1914.48 --> 1919.159

2286.48 --> 2293.04

[Music]

2333.599 --> 2340.04
yep wow steamy Traver yeah

2338.079 --> 2342.52
I mean the Indians effectively have a

2340.04 --> 2346.119
more advanced space Pro

2342.52 --> 2347.7599999999998
program because yeah they achieve the

2346.119 --> 2351.56
same horse

2347.76 --> 2354.3190000000004
[Â __Â ] but they don't cost that much

2351.56 --> 2356.2
money so I'd say they are the winner in

2354.319 --> 2360.2
this if there is such a thing as a

2356.2 --> 2360.2
winner with actors

2360.64 --> 2365.7599999999998
guilds what is my tattoo what the [Â __Â ]

2363.92 --> 2368.44

2365.76 --> 2368.44
tattoos

2375.14 --> 2378.33
[Music]

2391.079 --> 2398.4
what where are you getting that why are

2393.24 --> 2398.3999999999996
you asking that what kind of

2410.28 --> 2415.8
a tattoo on my wrist why the [Â __Â ] would

2413.319 --> 2421.599
I do

2415.8 --> 2423.8390000000004
that I mean except for my Holocaust Camp

2421.599 --> 2427.1600000000003
tattoo but no I don't really have a

2423.839 --> 2432.56
holocaust Camp tattoo but

2427.16 --> 2434.72
uh yeah no no I don't have toos at all I

2432.56 --> 2437.68
specifically avoided that there's no

2434.72 --> 2437.68
writing on this

2444.21 --> 2447.289

[Music]

2455.319 --> 2458.319
skin

2459.44 --> 2466.76
no but seriously if I had a holocaust

2461.359 --> 2466.7599999999998
Camp tattoo I would definitely have it

2476.68 --> 2480.3999999999996
removed right because otherwise

2478.599 --> 2484.88
everybody's just going to keep asking me

2480.4 --> 2484.88
questions like oh how many people were

2485.24 --> 2491.7999999999997
there

2488.04 --> 2491.8
do you know where they kept the

2492.48 --> 2497.0
incinerator right I don't want to be

2495.2 --> 2499.56
asked those kind of

2497.0 --> 2502.88
questions all the

2499.56 --> 2507.68
time so I definitely have my uh

2502.88 --> 2510.52
Holocaust Camp tattoo removed if I had

2507.68 --> 2512.5989999999997
one almost time for fed already yeah I

2512.599 --> 2521.1600000000003
short show very very short but hey we

2516.48 --> 2521.16
had we talked about NASA and stuff

2521.64 --> 2529.5989999999997

it was insane teret I mean what NASA

2536.56 --> 2543.48
spent percentile wise in the' 60s is

2540.2 --> 2545.7599999999998
absolutely absurd I mean yeah now that's

2543.48 --> 2548.16
very little compared to what they spend

2545.76 --> 2549.8390000000004
all their rest of it but back then it

2548.16 --> 2552.7999999999997
wasn't it was

2549.839 --> 2556.4
insane it was a significant percentage

2552.8 --> 2559.079
of the entire us budget

2556.4 --> 2561.1600000000003
