never actually

154.56 --> 160.48

which is to me even more amazing

160.48 --> 164.0
right so thank you very much

162.4 --> 167.12
anyway

164.0 --> 168.4
that today is kind of nice

167.12 --> 171.84
it's

168.4 --> 174.0
it's not raining and all that anymore

171.84 --> 175.92000000000002
it is a bit clouded but there's also

174.0 --> 178.159
some blue sky in between

175.92 --> 181.2
with a nice bit of sun

178.159 --> 185.84
not right now though

181.2 --> 185.83999999999997
still fairly warm a bit of wind

186.239 --> 192.04
so yeah

187.44 --> 192.04
nice day overall i'd say

201.2 --> 206.79899999999998
hello elise g first in chat good to see

203.84 --> 210.879
you pgsc net

206.799 --> 213.84
it is sunday the 21st of august

210.879 --> 213.84
2022

219.04 --> 221.35999999999999
all right

221.44 --> 226.159
and yeah i hope i'm gonna have a good

223.36 --> 229.44000000000003
show because i've had weird

226.159 --> 229.44
sort of stomach issues

229.92 --> 233.92
in the night and even in the morning

232.0 --> 235.519
it's weird i went to bed really early

233.92 --> 239.35999999999999
because of that

235.519 --> 243.36
it's just my stomach just feels like ah

239.36 --> 246.0
or it's stomach it's my belly

243.36 --> 247.28
and it's just like cramped and it just

246.0 --> 249.92
won't stop

247.28 --> 252.08
and i i can't pinpoint i i haven't even

249.92 --> 253.35999999999999
been able to basically reroute it using

252.08 --> 256.16
my healing

253.36 --> 259.199
which is odd

256.16 --> 261.519
so i tried contacting my healer

259.199 --> 264.88
over the phone but yeah it's not picking

261.519 --> 267.6
up and it's sunday so it's probably not

264.88 --> 270.479
i don't think he he rarely picks up on

267.6 --> 270.47900000000004
the sunday so

274.8 --> 279.199
but despite that i feel good feel clear

277.44 --> 281.04
took a shower that's why i've got my

279.199 --> 283.36
hair loose again

281.04 --> 285.44
and clean up my sheets and all that

283.36 --> 287.52000000000004
which was like really necessary it's

285.44 --> 289.6
like summer stuff

287.52 --> 292.24
and now it yeah finally it looks kind of

289.6 --> 292.24
white again

293.36 --> 297.84000000000003
yeah

294.16 --> 297.84000000000003
so i did have a great sleep

299.04 --> 302.47900000000004
and i do feel refreshed

302.639 --> 306.96000000000004
i've got another t-shirt on

305.28 --> 309.11999999999995
yeah

306.96 --> 310.88
my old t-shirt and a whole bunch of

309.12 --> 313.28000000000003
stuff is in the wash

310.88 --> 316.0
washing sheet right now so it's clean up

313.28 --> 316.0
weekend for me

316.16 --> 321.52000000000004
and i wish you could clean up that

318.88 --> 324.84
annoying tension

321.52 --> 324.84
down here

325.759 --> 330.24
but it might simply be just because of

327.759 --> 332.88
dreamwalking i mean i do build up

330.24 --> 336.96000000000004
tension from dreamwalking and carrying

332.88 --> 340.88
big things and big emotions even

336.96 --> 340.88
even though secondhand on my shoulders

342.639 --> 346.96000000000004
as an empath and it might be just the

344.88 --> 348.71999999999997
side effect of that it might also become

346.96 --> 350.15999999999997
be because of the transformation of

348.72 --> 351.6
summer

350.16 --> 352.56
into

351.6 --> 354.8
the

352.56 --> 357.52
yeah late stage where it's not really

354.8 --> 360.319
super not going to be super hot anymore

357.52 --> 363.039
my butt yeah it is kind of normal for

360.319 --> 365.68
typical seasonal transitions

363.039 --> 367.84
to have a bodily response to that for

365.68 --> 370.08
people that are sensitive to it which

367.84 --> 372.479
includes myself

370.08 --> 372.479
anyway

375.52 --> 380.31899999999996
i think i'm gonna compensate my uh

378.16 --> 382.08000000000004
eerie feeling by just being extremely

380.319 --> 385.759
chatty

382.08 --> 385.75899999999996
it is a good distraction from it

388.88 --> 391.199
right

393.6 --> 400.88
so how are you guys doing this sunday

398.08 --> 403.039
it's a bunch of different videos

400.88 --> 406.319
that i saw

403.039 --> 408.479
i was just watching mind unveiled

406.319 --> 411.68
but sports

408.479 --> 415.52
magnets and basketballs and all that

411.68 --> 417.039
weird very elaborate video but

415.52 --> 419.52
i've heard of it before it's just

417.039 --> 423.52
interesting to see some

419.52 --> 425.44
somebody dig into that again

423.52 --> 426.88
because it was just nice and how do you

425.44 --> 428.0
call that a

426.88 --> 430.56
moderate

428.0 --> 432.72
wasn't like oh it's all fake but no just

430.56 --> 436.199
very informative very informative video

432.72 --> 436.199
from mine unveiled

436.56 --> 440.759
posted nine hours ago

446.75 --> 449.949
[Music]

453.52 --> 457.84
oh yeah i think yeah jaren also had a

455.599 --> 457.84
show

460.08 --> 464.639
like a very late show for america

462.8 --> 467.759
but i i kind of caught the beginning of

464.639 --> 467.759
that this morning

472.8 --> 475.68
what else what else

476.639 --> 480.08
conscious of the video that was

478.16 --> 483.52000000000004
interesting another

480.08 --> 483.52
old-fashioned radio show

489.28 --> 493.28
oh yeah watch back yesterday the

491.12 --> 495.919
premiere from

493.28 --> 500.0
flat earth debate from thursday

495.919 --> 502.0
it was super rowdy show but good

500.0 --> 505.12
it was super rowdy everybody is

502.0 --> 509.479
constantly rumpusing each other

505.12 --> 509.479
but still good despite that

523.44 --> 528.2790000000001
augment reality contact lenses

534.48 --> 539.76
plugged into the eye socket

537.44 --> 539.7600000000001
what

540.24 --> 543.36
an iphone

544.0 --> 546.399
right

546.88 --> 550.32
well there is already like google

548.56 --> 552.7199999999999
glasses so

550.32 --> 552.72
you know

553.68 --> 559.12
which is like connectable with the

555.92 --> 560.8
computer or your phone so it

559.12 --> 565.44
if you seen it

560.8 --> 565.4399999999999
and it kind of already exists

565.6 --> 568.16
lsg

569.04 --> 573.12
but yeah it's going to be continuation

570.88 --> 575.279
you know i talked about it like the

573.12 --> 579.12
eventual evolution of it will be the

575.279 --> 581.279
circlet it will be like a little crown

579.12 --> 584.16
and that will as soon as you put it on

581.279 --> 586.0
after a tune first might be risky but if

584.16 --> 589.4399999999999
you successfully do that

586.0 --> 591.36
you just put it on and boom you're just

589.44 --> 593.2
i don't know what it would even be like

591.36 --> 595.2
as an experience maybe

593.2 --> 597.6800000000001
it could actually create like a micro

595.2 --> 599.839
dark world simulation

597.68 --> 602.079
like a living dream that you would be

599.839 --> 605.2790000000001
interfacing with

602.079 --> 608.3199999999999
who knows man maybe it would be like

605.279 --> 610.0
matrix reloaded remember oh no wait it's

608.32 --> 612.0
the original matrix

610.0 --> 613.519
did it show that

612.0 --> 615.839
i think they showed that in the second

613.519 --> 618.5600000000001
film when they returned to zion you have

615.839 --> 621.519
these operators in just a giant white

618.56 --> 624.3199999999999
room operating a holographic text that's

621.519 --> 626.5600000000001
just mid-floating mid-air right well

624.32 --> 629.0400000000001
maybe the circlet would do something

626.56 --> 629.04
like that

630.64 --> 635.8389999999999
right that's very sci-fi

633.44 --> 640.6400000000001
at this point but google glasses already

635.839 --> 640.6400000000001
exist so it's not that remote really

643.279 --> 645.6
five

644.959 --> 647.8389999999999
mean min

645.6 --> 651.2
a good choice what

647.839 --> 651.2
are you talking about brandon cook

658.72 --> 664.0790000000001
lazy today

661.76 --> 667.36
right okay pgc net fine

664.079 --> 667.3599999999999
we all love our off days

668.02 --> 672.0
[Music]

670.16 --> 675.519
but brandon cook could you what are you

672.0 --> 679.12
talking about five minutes

675.519 --> 679.12
is a good choice for what

681.839 --> 686.48
in order to

684.24 --> 687.6800000000001
become a subscriber

686.48 --> 691.04
it is

687.68 --> 691.04
is it set to five minutes

691.519 --> 696.32
could be

693.279 --> 697.8389999999999
but yeah i look i i spend a lot of time

696.32 --> 699.519
fine-tuning

697.839 --> 700.9590000000001
my stream set up

699.519 --> 702.9590000000001
a while ago

700.959 --> 705.279
because i have to deal with the trolls

702.959 --> 706.959
right that's why i did it

705.279 --> 707.8389999999999
can you imagine that there's actually a

706.959 --> 710.6389999999999
troll

707.839 --> 711.6800000000001
that makes tons of sock accounts

710.639 --> 713.839
and

711.68 --> 716.2399999999999
individually makes

713.839 --> 718.48
watches the show for five minutes with

716.24 --> 718.48
them

718.56 --> 724.4799999999999
probably on separate computers even

721.279 --> 727.519
i'm not even kidding just to be able to

724.48 --> 729.44
still spam troll me as i ban his socks

727.519 --> 731.76
like somebody's taking this effort which

729.44 --> 734.1600000000001
is completely mental

731.76 --> 734.16
it is

734.8 --> 738.88
all right but i got it

736.24 --> 740.32
even to no life type of trolls i gotta

738.88 --> 743.32
take

740.32 --> 743.32
action

751.2 --> 757.76
five minutes yeah yeah correct

754.32 --> 760.639
subscribers for five minutes

757.76 --> 764.0
what's the max i don't know

760.639 --> 764.0
do it for one hour no

764.16 --> 768.639
no i do want people to be able to

767.17 --> 773.3199999999999
[Music]

768.639 --> 773.32
speak up but you gotta do it right

773.92 --> 780.36
gotta just say hello

776.16 --> 780.36
or be known by me

796.079 --> 803.12
can be yeah no no no it can't be said

800.72 --> 805.2
it's more likely to be a singular

803.12 --> 806.9590000000001
individual every time

805.2 --> 809.36
otherwise

806.959 --> 811.68
there would literally be

809.36 --> 814.16
like several different trolls that would

811.68 --> 816.4799999999999
all troll at the exact same time that's

814.16 --> 819.6
what happens when different people are

816.48 --> 821.519
trolls in the same place yeah

819.6 --> 824.32
they're not like an automated

821.519 --> 826.16
organization that's just gonna wait for

824.32 --> 828.0790000000001
one troll to get banned in order to

826.16 --> 829.519
speak up as another that's not how that

828.079 --> 832.16
works at all

829.519 --> 834.32
so it's actually extremely likely that

832.16 --> 837.12
it is a singular person every single

834.32 --> 837.12
time that happens

838.399 --> 842.72
and it's not like there have been like

840.48 --> 843.76
multiple trolls at the same time at

842.72 --> 845.6
times

843.76 --> 847.36
you know how i know because then they

845.6 --> 849.36
kind of stop nagging me and start to

847.36 --> 851.92
have a conversation with each other in

849.36 --> 851.92
my chat

852.639 --> 857.8
and then you know that's probably

854.399 --> 857.8
different people

858.48 --> 863.139
anyway

859.97 --> 863.139
[Music]

895.76 --> 901.959
a year is

898.48 --> 901.9590000000001
holy [ __ ]

919.199 --> 923.76
okay well i'll think about it i'll think

921.519 --> 926.16
about maybe putting the time longer it's

923.76 --> 930.24
just

926.16 --> 930.24
it seems fine the way it is right now

932.639 --> 937.12
but this red youtube may not be here in

935.12 --> 941.5600000000001
a year what are you talking about rig

937.12 --> 941.5600000000001
back where are you getting that from

963.92 --> 967.959
look around me man

971.519 --> 975.23
so

972.02 --> 975.23
[Music]

978.88 --> 985.199
but america is getting bad oh

982.72 --> 986.88
yeah i don't see how that denmark what

985.199 --> 988.959
the hell's denmark have to do with that

986.88 --> 990.88
i'm in the netherlands rig back not

988.959 --> 992.4799999999999
denmark

990.88 --> 995.519
but

992.48 --> 997.6800000000001
that's not really all that relevant

995.519 --> 1000.24
i mean even if the the brick in the

997.68 --> 1003.4399999999999
united states goes into like a straight

1000.24 --> 1004.32
out hot war with literal cities blowing

1003.44 --> 1006.8800000000001
up

1004.32 --> 1010.1600000000001
youtube still gonna persist

1006.88 --> 1012.48
you know why because they have a giant

1010.16 --> 1012.48
ship

1013.12 --> 1018.16
it's not gonna go down you see

1016.16 --> 1020.48
it is basically

1018.16 --> 1021.92
it is rooted like

1020.48 --> 1024.079
legally

1021.92 --> 1027.36
in the united states but it is basically

1024.079 --> 1030.72
its own entity at this point like

1027.36 --> 1030.7199999999998
sufficiency wise

1032.079 --> 1038.319
or did you forget that they have like a

1035.039 --> 1039.679
giant container ship that is literally a

1038.319 --> 1040.8799999999999
giant

1039.679 --> 1043.3600000000001
hub

1040.88 --> 1045.8390000000002
did you forget that

1043.36 --> 1049.7199999999998
because they do they've had it for like

1045.839 --> 1049.72
10 years now

1052.0 --> 1057.039
youtube needs service to yeah and they

1054.559 --> 1059.52
have it they literally have enough

1057.039 --> 1061.76
servers

1059.52 --> 1063.6
to run it even if the world didn't have

1061.76 --> 1065.679
any

1063.6 --> 1067.84
well it needs connection they got their

1065.679 --> 1071.44
servers they got everything they got it

1067.84 --> 1071.4399999999998
all on one giant freighter

1074.08 --> 1080.76
they had it for a decade

1076.88 --> 1080.7600000000002
a decade rigbeck

1084.48 --> 1087.6
not without people to run it

1086.559 --> 1088.8799999999999
yeah

1087.6 --> 1091.36
yeah

1088.88 --> 1092.64
mostly without people to run it you know

1091.36 --> 1096.559
how

1092.64 --> 1098.0800000000002
they got a couple of like engineers

1096.559 --> 1101.44
for maintenance

1098.08 --> 1103.12
that's really all they need

1101.44 --> 1105.3600000000001
okay that's probably gonna be like a

1103.12 --> 1108.8799999999999
hundred people maybe a thousand even i

1105.36 --> 1111.52
don't know how big that ship even is

1108.88 --> 1114.5590000000002
but that's it

1111.52 --> 1114.559
that's mostly it

1120.4 --> 1125.679
so i think you uh

1123.2 --> 1126.96
you're down playing

1125.679 --> 1129.44
youtube's

1126.96 --> 1129.44
backing

1135.6 --> 1139.36
a couple people to run youtube

1137.919 --> 1142.0
yeah

1139.36 --> 1144.4799999999998
i mean it's not gonna be

1142.0 --> 1146.24
super great then because that would mean

1144.48 --> 1148.08
if there's less people that means a lot

1146.24 --> 1150.88
less moderators

1148.08 --> 1153.9189999999999
here's the thing though

1150.88 --> 1155.3600000000001
let's just say that youtube headquarters

1153.919 --> 1157.919
i think it was in california or

1155.36 --> 1160.3999999999999
something just completely blows up

1157.919 --> 1163.039
and they lose all their offices and they

1160.4 --> 1165.76
only got that ship left right

1163.039 --> 1167.28
with the actual attack that they need to

1165.76 --> 1169.2
keep it running

1167.28 --> 1171.6789999999999
well

1169.2 --> 1174.0
what's stopping them from literally just

1171.679 --> 1176.16
going to another harbor

1174.0 --> 1177.44
in another country

1176.16 --> 1181.28
who knows like

1177.44 --> 1183.8400000000001
dubai or dubai or something right

1181.28 --> 1186.799
and just like okay uh well we're gonna

1183.84 --> 1189.6789999999999
now reinstall our headquarters here then

1186.799 --> 1193.52
because that place where we used to be

1189.679 --> 1194.88
it's kind of trashed right now it's

1193.52 --> 1196.48
right

1194.88 --> 1198.64
i mean

1196.48 --> 1198.64
no

1199.2 --> 1203.52
doesn't matter what the hell happens to

1201.12 --> 1205.6
united states youtube is probably not

1203.52 --> 1208.24
going to go down as a direct consequence

1205.6 --> 1211.12
of what happens in the and in and to the

1208.24 --> 1211.1200000000001
united states

1215.2 --> 1221.8400000000001
hey flatter sage good to see you

1218.64 --> 1221.8400000000001
george sanford

1230.48 --> 1235.52
[ __ ] okay go ahead and cook i'm just

1234.32 --> 1238.6399999999999
talking

1235.52 --> 1241.28
i'm just trying to be sensible here

1238.64 --> 1242.72
all this talk of oh we're gonna lose it

1241.28 --> 1247.24
all oh really

1242.72 --> 1247.24
what ex what exactly how

1252.08 --> 1257.039
i mean don't forget that

1254.559 --> 1258.1589999999999
google and youtube

1257.039 --> 1260.1589999999999
which is

1258.159 --> 1262.159
a small part of it

1260.159 --> 1265.2800000000002
really at this point but still like

1262.159 --> 1268.4
electronic-wise the biggest part

1265.28 --> 1271.36
it's a mega corporation

1268.4 --> 1272.3200000000002
and like not just a mega corporation but

1271.36 --> 1274.32
like

1272.32 --> 1276.6399999999999
one of the biggest mega corporations

1274.32 --> 1280.0
that has ever existed

1276.64 --> 1280.0
that's actually like

1282.88 --> 1287.2
yeah not like for example black

1285.76 --> 1289.039
[ __ ] i think it is even part of

1287.2 --> 1292.64
blackrock or something i don't even know

1289.039 --> 1296.08
how it's higher how the hierarchy works

1292.64 --> 1297.48
the the point is it's [ __ ] huge

1296.08 --> 1300.32
and they have

1297.48 --> 1303.52
self-sufficiency and they worked on it a

1300.32 --> 1305.28
decade ago guys this is not something

1303.52 --> 1308.24
like oh [ __ ] oh the world's going to

1305.28 --> 1310.72
[ __ ] we have to quickly do no they had

1308.24 --> 1313.44
a completely

1310.72 --> 1316.64
self-sufficient freighter full with

1313.44 --> 1319.52
surfers a decade ago

1316.64 --> 1321.5200000000002
yeah you should not really need to worry

1319.52 --> 1323.039
that oh my god we're going to lose you

1321.52 --> 1324.08
to no

1323.039 --> 1325.2
just

1324.08 --> 1327.52
know

1325.2 --> 1329.3600000000001
this

1327.52 --> 1331.12
only way you're going to lose it is

1329.36 --> 1333.36
politically

1331.12 --> 1336.2399999999998
if it gets so corrupted that it's simply

1333.36 --> 1338.4799999999998
not accessible anymore

1336.24 --> 1339.1200000000001
that's the only way we're going to lose

1338.48 --> 1342.559
it

1339.12 --> 1342.559
because it's not going to go away

1344.4 --> 1350.48
i mean maybe

1346.799 --> 1352.96
maybe for look it could still end if

1350.48 --> 1354.96
somebody decides to like shoot an emp

1352.96 --> 1355.8400000000001
right at that ship

1354.96 --> 1357.76
right

1355.84 --> 1360.559
or literally sync it

1357.76 --> 1361.919
yeah then youtube's got a problem well

1360.559 --> 1363.12
how the hell are they going to replace

1361.919 --> 1366.88
that

1363.12 --> 1366.8799999999999
but other than that it's just no

1372.799 --> 1378.24
you don't care well i care i'm using it

1376.24 --> 1381.039
you're using it

1378.24 --> 1386.84
this is where we hang out

1381.039 --> 1386.84
this is how i get by this is my job

1399.52 --> 1405.369
fireproof backups

1402.21 --> 1405.3690000000001
[Music]

1406.64 --> 1410.96
they got the ship

1408.48 --> 1412.96
dude maybe they got multiple

1410.96 --> 1415.2
i don't even know i just know they had

1412.96 --> 1419.8400000000001
the one ship but maybe they've made like

1415.2 --> 1419.8400000000001
another two since then i'd have no idea

1421.55 --> 1425.36
[Music]

1422.919 --> 1428.6000000000001
self-sufficiency is a fallacy what does

1425.36 --> 1428.6
that mean

1449.039 --> 1454.559
that takes a society

1451.919 --> 1455.6000000000001
yeah well there's plenty of societies

1454.559 --> 1458.48
you know

1455.6 --> 1462.08
rig back i'd like to remind you that the

1458.48 --> 1463.3600000000001
united states is not the only country in

1462.08 --> 1466.3999999999999
the world

1463.36 --> 1469.6
i know that people in the united states

1466.4 --> 1473.5590000000002
typically don't like that notion

1469.6 --> 1473.559
it is true however

1492.44 --> 1495.76
[Music]

1493.6 --> 1500.36
it's the world currency though yeah that

1495.76 --> 1500.36
doesn't really mean anything though

1500.48 --> 1503.679
it's just a currency

1504.4 --> 1508.4
yes it gives the united states a whole

1506.159 --> 1510.48
bunch of advantages but that could just

1508.4 --> 1513.48
rearrange very quickly it is already

1510.48 --> 1513.48
rearranging

1514.08 --> 1518.08
right

1515.12 --> 1522.2399999999998
i mean russia is making its move

1518.08 --> 1526.1589999999999
totally deserved totally legitimate

1522.24 --> 1528.159
and the united states can't do [ __ ]

1526.159 --> 1532.4
and they've tried everything they

1528.159 --> 1533.2
literally started an illegal war

1532.4 --> 1535.8400000000001
by

1533.2 --> 1540.8400000000001
throwing piles of money

1535.84 --> 1544.9599999999998
and weapons at a full-on satanic nazi

1540.84 --> 1548.799
[ __ ] who just attacks and gets tens of

1544.96 --> 1549.76
thousands of people killed a day

1548.799 --> 1554.32
okay

1549.76 --> 1554.32
that's how desperate united states is

1554.559 --> 1560.24
to hold on to that dollar for the world

1557.2 --> 1563.039
reserve currency it's just not working

1560.24 --> 1563.039
not at all

1568.559 --> 1572.96
root your smartphone uh i don't have a

1570.88 --> 1575.2
smartphone george sanford

1572.96 --> 1578.32
i've never had one

1575.2 --> 1578.32
not a single one

1579.2 --> 1585.1200000000001
i have a telephone a mobile telephone

1583.44 --> 1588.64
you can

1585.12 --> 1592.9599999999998
voice chat on it with another person who

1588.64 --> 1596.24
also has a telephone and you can send

1592.96 --> 1599.1200000000001
instant text messages to another person

1596.24 --> 1601.02
with a telephone isn't it amazing

1599.12 --> 1604.2199999999998
it's all you'll ever need

1601.02 --> 1604.22
[Music]

1606.72 --> 1609.91
[Music]

1610.799 --> 1615.12
for everything else i got a desktop pc

1613.6 --> 1619.559
computer

1615.12 --> 1619.559
with a landline internet connection

1625.32 --> 1628.55
[Music]

1634.72 --> 1637.72
uh

1654.24 --> 1658.96
any pc on windows 10 and 11 is literally

1657.2 --> 1661.44
used as the cloud yeah that's cute

1658.96 --> 1664.48
that's why i'm running on windows 7 and

1661.44 --> 1666.48
not windows 10 or 11

1664.48 --> 1668.799
because it still works

1666.48 --> 1670.559
works perfectly

1668.799 --> 1673.12
perfectly

1670.559 --> 1675.36
i mean there's typical annoying little

1673.12 --> 1677.9189999999999
glitches with programs

1675.36 --> 1680.0
but that has always been there

1677.919 --> 1681.1200000000001
throughout my entire life

1680.0 --> 1683.279
always

1681.12 --> 1686.399
programs always have freaking glitches

1683.279 --> 1689.12
and always need updates etc etc

1686.399 --> 1692.399
yeah i don't update anymore and i don't

1689.12 --> 1695.52
need to still got a secure computer

1692.399 --> 1698.1589999999999
don't need to upgrade windows

1695.52 --> 1698.1589999999999
oh frick

1698.64 --> 1706.1200000000001
my video just froze

1702.159 --> 1706.1200000000001
it's only good shot though

1733.679 --> 1739.039
some newer software oh no i can't run

1736.799 --> 1741.36
the newer software why the [ __ ] would i

1739.039 --> 1744.08
want to even do that

1741.36 --> 1747.12
like don't you know

1744.08 --> 1750.96
look at what's out there why would you

1747.12 --> 1753.12
really really need the newest of the

1750.96 --> 1755.76
newest dude

1753.12 --> 1757.6789999999999
there's enough software out there

1755.76 --> 1761.2
to keep you busy

1757.679 --> 1762.96
on a high high grade level for [ __ ]

1761.2 --> 1765.52
50 years

1762.96 --> 1767.6000000000001
and you can all get it free by now it's

1765.52 --> 1769.679
because it's all deserted they just

1767.6 --> 1772.48
threw it away because it's not new

1769.679 --> 1775.48
enough anymore

1772.48 --> 1775.48
why

1782.96 --> 1789.6000000000001
what what is the newer software that i

1786.08 --> 1792.84
so so desperately need to run that i

1789.6 --> 1794.399
have to install the newer

1792.84 --> 1795.36
windows

1794.399 --> 1798.559
the

1795.36 --> 1802.7199999999998
latest games yeah yeah no i don't

1798.559 --> 1805.52
no i don't like the latest games

1802.72 --> 1805.52
they suck

1807.52 --> 1813.52
the only games i like are at least at

1811.44 --> 1816.24
least a decade old

1813.52 --> 1818.72
every newer game that i've played

1816.24 --> 1818.72
sucks

1820.08 --> 1824.48
and i stopped playing them and then i

1822.32 --> 1826.799
delete them and then i never play them

1824.48 --> 1828.3990000000001
again because they suck

1826.799 --> 1832.1589999999999
and they're slow

1828.399 --> 1834.9599999999998
and they're over graphic graphic graphic

1832.159 --> 1838.48
over graphics

1834.96 --> 1841.3600000000001
weird graphics okay that's a word now

1838.48 --> 1843.6
and it's a stupid game it's all the new

1841.36 --> 1845.279
games they suck

1843.6 --> 1848.1589999999999
why the hell would i even want to play

1845.279 --> 1850.64
that [ __ ] shitty new games that are

1848.159 --> 1852.3200000000002
[ __ ] slow that literally eat your

1850.64 --> 1854.24
computer from the inside out because

1852.32 --> 1856.24
they're so

1854.24 --> 1858.799
monstrously

1856.24 --> 1863.32
big and bloaty

1858.799 --> 1863.32
why the hell would i even want that

1869.76 --> 1877.8799999999999
yeah i will i will run windows 7 forever

1874.64 --> 1877.88
i will

1882.88 --> 1888.88
yeah

1885.12 --> 1891.36
i mean i run windows 95 if that would

1888.88 --> 1893.3600000000001
still be sensible to do

1891.36 --> 1896.4799999999998
no i know i wouldn't actually because

1893.36 --> 1897.84
windows 95 constantly crashed even back

1896.48 --> 1900.08
then so

issues from all the windows before that

1918.399 --> 1923.5189999999998
time since windows 95 all of them all

1921.2 --> 1926.88
the issues they had have

1923.519 --> 1928.48

1942.64 --> 1947.3990000000001
at all for almost nothing

1951.679 --> 1959.2
problem is them not updating oh no

1974.88 --> 1978.3200000000002
everything for you because you're a

professionally

2068.879 --> 2073.919
like he said oh yeah you really should

2071.119 --> 2076.639

2152.56 --> 2157.599
just stop it

2154.32 --> 2160.079
stop falling for the scam it's a scam

2157.599 --> 2162.1400000000003

[Music]

2175.68 --> 2182.0

2179.76 --> 2185.3590000000004
windows 95 was fine

2182.0 --> 2186.56
i mean it sucked but it was fine

2185.359 --> 2189.359
good enough

2186.56 --> 2189.359
for that time

2190.079 --> 2194.96
but god damn it did it crash a lot this

2192.88 --> 2194.96
is

2196.56 --> 2202.0789999999997
it's like it would windows 95 crashed

2199.359 --> 2204.64
literally every day at least once

2202.079 --> 2204.6400000000003
literally

2208.16 --> 2215.1189999999997
used xp yeah xp was was great

2211.52 --> 2216.48
windows 7 a lot better windows 7 is the

2215.119 --> 2219.119
best version

2216.48 --> 2222.079
it is it's the best version

2219.119 --> 2225.7200000000003
it's the one i'm going to keep using

2222.079 --> 2225.7200000000003
until i'm dead

2239.359 --> 2242.56
there's my proof

2246.16 --> 2249.5989999999997
see

2247.68 --> 2250.64
the real one

2249.599 --> 2253.839
ooh

2250.64 --> 2256.0789999999997
and i got a stupid windows 10 disc too

2253.839 --> 2258.4
i've never even put that in my dvd

2256.079 --> 2261.52
player

2258.4 --> 2261.52
because i don't need it

2267.52 --> 2273.2
nothing like windows 98 crashing yeah

2271.839 --> 2275.92
blue screen of death when he was

2273.2 --> 2278.64
demonstrating it yeah yeah yeah

2275.92 --> 2281.2000000000003
oh yeah okay fair enough bjc net but

2278.64 --> 2283.44
windows 98 lasted very

2281.2 --> 2286.72
not very long

2283.44 --> 2288.7200000000003
but it had massive startup issues like

2286.72 --> 2291.1189999999997
in the beginning it was really at

2288.72 --> 2293.5989999999997
problems but then later much later it

2291.119 --> 2295.2000000000003
got an update and that was really good

2293.599 --> 2298.079
and that was much more stable than

2295.2 --> 2301.839
windows 95.

2298.079 --> 2304.1600000000003
winners 95 was just universally buggy

2301.839 --> 2306.7999999999997
but windows 98 yes it started up

2304.16 --> 2308.96
terrible but then it it worked out

2306.8 --> 2311.28
pretty decently then they changed to

2308.96 --> 2314.32
windows millennium and that was just

2311.28 --> 2314.32
pure trash

2314.56 --> 2320.48
like that was just trash

2317.04 --> 2320.48
that thing sucked

2322.24 --> 2327.839
what is it

2323.599 --> 2327.839
oh hello by the way does studio 68

2337.359 --> 2341.7599999999998
vista was the last operations system you

2340.4 --> 2346.2400000000002
could use

2341.76 --> 2346.2400000000002
burner software to copy deeply what

2348.24 --> 2352.56
well it's still out there

2350.24 --> 2355.56
but yeah you gotta really find the right

2352.56 --> 2355.56
one

2358.64 --> 2364.24
hello miss crazy

2360.8 --> 2364.2400000000002
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2364.32 --> 2368.079
oh

2366.0 --> 2370.56
okay yeah it least he

2368.079 --> 2370.5600000000004
agreed

2372.079 --> 2378.6400000000003
bill gates is a greedy hoe and a scumbag

2375.839 --> 2380.96
and a eugenicist and a [ __ ]

2378.64 --> 2382.64
he is a [ __ ] he literally doesn't

2380.96 --> 2384.4
understand [ __ ]

2382.64 --> 2386.64
about people

2384.4 --> 2389.92
like he is a freaking

2386.64 --> 2392.8799999999997
like robot probably born psychopath

2389.92 --> 2392.88
really pitiful

2395.2 --> 2399.1189999999997
there's no

2396.4 --> 2400.64
sympathy sensitive sensory

2399.119 --> 2401.839
but uh

2400.64 --> 2404.7999999999997
yeah

2401.839 --> 2407.359
windows 7 is fine

2404.8 --> 2411.52
i mean it's not just bill gates guys

2407.359 --> 2413.7599999999998
it's it's a really freaking big company

2411.52 --> 2416.079
that was software development

2413.76 --> 2419.599
and they kind of sucked their hierarchy

2416.079 --> 2421.28
kind of sucked it was all very corporate

2419.599 --> 2423.92
but that doesn't mean that all the

2421.28 --> 2428.44
people that worked on it all are evil

2423.92 --> 2428.44
like bill gates that's ridiculous

2439.119 --> 2443.2000000000003
yeah i know pgcnet i remember that

2443.359 --> 2449.68
oh it's for free yeah right oh yes so

2447.119 --> 2452.96
that means it's gonna suck and i'm gonna

2449.68 --> 2457.64
really regret it

2452.96 --> 2457.64
just like a free slave tattoo

2458.51 --> 2461.719
[Music]

2467.119 --> 2472.56
i didn't know that windows 11 is even

2469.04 --> 2474.72
worse i'm not even going to try it

2472.56 --> 2478.24
like i will not try it i'm just going to

2474.72 --> 2481.24
keep using that over and over and over

2478.24 --> 2481.24
again

2492.88 --> 2497.28
to not remove cortana just come back

2495.119 --> 2499.839
yeah yeah i don't have that problem

2497.28 --> 2502.8
george sanford i don't have that problem

2499.839 --> 2503.92
you see i don't have any software on my

2502.8 --> 2508.6400000000003
computer

2503.92 --> 2511.44
that's running that i don't want to run

2508.64 --> 2515.2
i have manual control

2511.44 --> 2515.2000000000003
windows 7 still allowed that

2515.92 --> 2520.56
and it can be a bit hectic hectic

2518.319 --> 2522.88
finding your way through although it's

2520.56 --> 2524.7999999999997
much better than like in windows 98

2522.88 --> 2528.1600000000003
where like everything was just

2524.8 --> 2532.48
directories now we have a lot more like

2528.16 --> 2532.48
utility menus and all that

2534.079 --> 2539.92
bill gates lawyers must be savage dude

2536.48 --> 2539.92
they're their own companies

2545.599 --> 2548.4
i mean

2546.72 --> 2549.5989999999997
those must be like

2548.4 --> 2552.56
the biggest

2549.599 --> 2555.52
corporate lawyers around pretty much

2552.56 --> 2558.0
or among the biggest

2555.52 --> 2558.0
but uh

2559.599 --> 2562.839
couldn't you just block windows with

2561.52 --> 2565.599
your route or

2562.839 --> 2568.48
what spyware stuff

2565.599 --> 2570.96
no you just don't have it installed

2568.48 --> 2573.04
look the problem rig back is that if you

2570.96 --> 2575.119
install a windows version it's going to

2573.04 --> 2577.92
install things that are defaulted to

2575.119 --> 2580.48
install if you cannot unselect those

2577.92 --> 2583.04
defaulted details it's going to install

2580.48 --> 2585.119
stuff and if those things are not

2583.04 --> 2586.96
de-installable

2585.119 --> 2589.2000000000003
then you will not be able to de-install

2586.96 --> 2592.64
the only way to do that is to literally

2589.2 --> 2595.5989999999997
reinstall an entire new version

2592.64 --> 2599.5989999999997
that doesn't force you to install that

2595.599 --> 2603.52
right just like i don't install

2599.599 --> 2606.0
stupid internet security programs oh

2603.52 --> 2607.92
this window you really have to do that

2606.0 --> 2609.52
yes you no

2607.92 --> 2611.359
no you don't

2609.52 --> 2614.16

2628.72 --> 2633.839
spybot search and destroy works

2631.28 --> 2635.92

i take good care of my computer it works

2638.56 --> 2643.839

delete your windows 11 and 10

2673.44 --> 2680.7200000000003
get a windows 7 at the discount bin

2677.839 --> 2683.92
make sure you got the right code for it

2680.72 --> 2686.48
and then use that

2683.92 --> 2688.96
oh no i can't do the latest update [ __ ]

2686.48 --> 2692.2400000000002
you then don't do that stop being a

2688.96 --> 2693.76
wussy stop being scared if some stupid

2692.24 --> 2696.56
pop-up

2693.76 --> 2697.5200000000004
still do you have to do this no you

2696.56 --> 2699.119
don't

2697.52 --> 2700.4
you just have to know what the [ __ ]

2699.119 --> 2702.4
you're doing

2700.4 --> 2705.76
that's all

2702.4 --> 2708.48
the only way to win this is by not being

2705.76 --> 2711.119
a complacent [ __ ]

2708.48 --> 2711.119
that's all

2712.64 --> 2718.72
why give windows any money fine dude if

2715.44 --> 2721.28
you can torrent it

2718.72 --> 2724.319
you say and actually get a legitimate

2721.28 --> 2726.2400000000002
code that you can keep reusing because i

2724.319 --> 2728.8
never has to have an issue with my code

2726.24 --> 2731.1189999999997
it's my code i literally bought it i can

2728.8 --> 2733.44
use that code forever

2731.119 --> 2734.48
you understand forever that's worth

2733.44 --> 2736.8
something

2734.48 --> 2736.8
yeah

2737.119 --> 2740.7200000000003
i can use it forever

2741.52 --> 2745.4
so there is no issue

2746.4 --> 2751.28
yeah that's worth paying some money even

2749.2 --> 2754.0789999999997
freaking

2751.28 --> 2754.079
microsoft

2755.52 --> 2759.92
you never bought away fine okay if you

2757.44 --> 2761.76
can get by like that then you do that

2759.92 --> 2766.96
you know

2761.76 --> 2766.96
i have got my money out of this a lot

2768.0 --> 2772.079
right i don't need to panic like oh [ __ ]

2770.079 --> 2774.5600000000004
my code suddenly not working anymore

2772.079 --> 2776.0
when i tried to reinstall it surprised

2774.56 --> 2778.319
right it's like oh [ __ ] my computer

2776.0 --> 2779.76
crashed really bad or my heart is like

2778.319 --> 2781.839
literally broke

2779.76 --> 2784.4
i got it like in reinstall it and then

2781.839 --> 2786.24
it's like oh [ __ ] the code's not working

2784.4 --> 2788.96
ah

2786.24 --> 2790.16
straight

2788.96 --> 2792.64
yeah

2790.16 --> 2794.3999999999996
yeah i don't have that issue

2792.64 --> 2798.5989999999997
ever

2794.4 --> 2798.599
it's worth paying for

2817.76 --> 2822.0
the [ __ ] are you talking about it's

2820.24 --> 2824.7999999999997
crazy this is

2822.0 --> 2829.079
yo don't talk to me like that

2824.8 --> 2829.079
how [ __ ] do you think you are

2835.68 --> 2839.839
don't call me young man

2837.68 --> 2843.44
i'm surrounded by

2839.839 --> 2846.0
like mid-range to old boomers they don't

2843.44 --> 2849.52
call me young man nobody calls me young

2846.0 --> 2849.52
man i'm not that young okay

2850.079 --> 2854.7200000000003
and this is a ridiculous non-subject

2852.8 --> 2856.6400000000003
question you're asking there just

2854.72 --> 2860.48
annoying

2856.64 --> 2860.48
[ __ ] [ __ ] about pewdiepie

2868.559 --> 2872.4
okay well good for you it's never

2870.16 --> 2875.359
happened to you it has happened to me in

2872.4 --> 2878.0
the past it was really [ __ ] annoying

2875.359 --> 2880.64
that's why i just chose okay i'm gonna

2878.0 --> 2884.48
install this entire thing from scratch

2880.64 --> 2885.7599999999998
i'm gonna buy every part of it

2884.48 --> 2889.119
including

2885.76 --> 2891.44
the software to run it

2889.119 --> 2893.44
right that way i have rights

2891.44 --> 2895.52
i literally have rights

2893.44 --> 2897.28
so let's just imagine

2895.52 --> 2900.16
that that code

2897.28 --> 2902.2400000000002
for some reason wouldn't work yeah i

2900.16 --> 2905.1189999999997
don't know why

2902.24 --> 2907.2799999999997
then i can now literally just call a

2905.119 --> 2909.6800000000003
company say i bought this software i

2907.28 --> 2912.079
know it's 10 years out of date

2909.68 --> 2914.72
but that doesn't matter i should be able

2912.079 --> 2917.04
to reinstall it i'll just say i'm not

2914.72 --> 2920.0789999999997
using it for the internet right and then

2917.04 --> 2923.2
i have rights because i bought it

2920.079 --> 2927.52
you see there is actually just technical

2923.2 --> 2929.839
advantage sometimes to buying things

2927.52 --> 2929.839
right

2939.44 --> 2943.559
and that rig back is weird

2952.319 --> 2957.52
and besides like you don't you guys

2954.72 --> 2959.52
don't call me that so it's just weird i

2957.52 --> 2961.2
think miss crazy ad is a

2959.52 --> 2962.8
troll

2961.2 --> 2965.5989999999997
what the hell does it make like what is

2962.8 --> 2967.599
she saying like literally it's not

2965.599 --> 2970.2400000000002
related to anything it makes no [ __ ]

2967.599 --> 2973.3590000000004
sense that could literally be an a.i

2970.24 --> 2974.7999999999997
generated message it's stupid doesn't

2973.359 --> 2977.839
mean anything

2974.8 --> 2980.7200000000003
it's not related to anything

2977.839 --> 2984.16
or do you guys disagree did you find

2980.72 --> 2986.72
miss crazy at messages enormously

2984.16 --> 2988.8799999999997
inspiring so much that you literally do

2986.72 --> 2991.52
not address it and they're just gaping

2988.88 --> 2992.88
at it and off like whoa

2991.52 --> 2995.599
man

2992.88 --> 2999.2400000000002
that made so much sense i'm gonna ponder

2995.599 --> 2999.2400000000002
on this for hours

3022.64 --> 3027.839
ass

3024.559 --> 3027.8390000000004
not ace

3031.2 --> 3035.2
the next france is bacon what

3037.359 --> 3041.839
hello seeking star wars good to see you

3059.44 --> 3064.0
young man is something a lot of elderly

3061.52 --> 3067.28
people say yeah when they want to claim

3064.0 --> 3071.2
their elderly status over you

3067.28 --> 3071.2000000000003
so i fully for example expect

3072.079 --> 3077.52
professor phil bell to call me young man

3075.44 --> 3079.28
when he's trying to like

3077.52 --> 3081.599
like oh oh i think you're doing

3079.28 --> 3083.8390000000004
something slightly bad

3081.599 --> 3085.3590000000004
and then he might address me like that

3083.839 --> 3088.0789999999997
because that's

3085.359 --> 3088.0789999999997
a tactic

3089.92 --> 3092.2400000000002
right

3092.64 --> 3098.5589999999997
addressing somebody as a young man

3095.76 --> 3100.48
literally emphasizes the day age

3098.559 --> 3101.6800000000003
difference that's what it does why would

3100.48 --> 3104.16
you do that

3101.68 --> 3107.1189999999997
maybe for a social effect

3104.16 --> 3109.839
right so it is literally just putting

3107.119 --> 3112.2400000000002
your elderly weight

3109.839 --> 3114.0789999999997
which could be perceived as an authority

3112.24 --> 3117.7599999999998
that's right

3114.079 --> 3121.04
onto the other it's a form of subtle

3117.76 --> 3121.0400000000004
social manipulation

3122.8 --> 3130.0
and that can be good i mean if you like

3126.96 --> 3132.48
if you're like it's your grandkid right

3130.0 --> 3135.04
and then you're your grandpa or grandma

3132.48 --> 3138.16
and they're like really

3135.04 --> 3140.48
into something and then like you're you

3138.16 --> 3142.64
want to like compliment them you can say

3140.48 --> 3144.64
young man too right

3142.64 --> 3147.2799999999997
like it all depends on what you're gonna

3144.64 --> 3147.2799999999997
use it with

3147.44 --> 3149.839
anyway

3151.2 --> 3155.52
see it's just one message

3153.52 --> 3158.8
just one message

3155.52 --> 3161.92
that didn't make any [ __ ] sense

3158.8 --> 3165.04
like seven minutes ago and nothing else

3161.92 --> 3167.119
right i mean what the [ __ ] is that

3165.04 --> 3170.8
why would you do that

3167.119 --> 3170.8
it's like butt activity

3176.079 --> 3179.079
weird

3186.4 --> 3191.839
yeah i agree i mean my dad

3189.359 --> 3194.72
used to call me young man a lot

3191.839 --> 3197.72
especially when i was acting like a

3194.72 --> 3197.72
teenager

3208.0 --> 3213.2
right at least yeah that made no sense

3210.72 --> 3215.7599999999998
nothing about it made any sense it just

3213.2 --> 3217.9199999999996
seemed like an artificially generated

3215.76 --> 3220.92
message

3217.92 --> 3220.92
ridiculous

3226.16 --> 3230.0789999999997
all right

3227.599 --> 3232.8
let's stop reviewing that stupid little

3230.079 --> 3232.8
chat message

3232.83 --> 3239.119
[Music]

3234.96 --> 3239.119
what the [ __ ] is a pewdiepie really

3241.359 --> 3245.2799999999997
what

3242.24 --> 3245.2799999999997
i mean come on

3246.72 --> 3250.9599999999996
you don't know that i mean even i know

3249.2 --> 3254.3999999999996
that and i'm like

3250.96 --> 3254.4
internet boomer guy

3259.68 --> 3265.839
the other message was eek

3263.119 --> 3265.839
what

3267.359 --> 3271.359
where oh you're right heck

3271.89 --> 3274.949
[Music]

3277.119 --> 3282.6400000000003
never saw pewdiepie ever wow okay

3280.4 --> 3285.52
well he was only like the number one

3282.64 --> 3287.68
youtube guy in the world or something

3285.52 --> 3291.0
or years

3287.68 --> 3291.0
that's all

3292.0 --> 3296.079
is just a guy from norway or was it

3295.04 --> 3299.2799999999997
sweden

3296.079 --> 3301.04
that's like really good at editing mimi

3299.28 --> 3303.3590000000004
videos

3301.04 --> 3305.599
it would just like play games and review

3303.359 --> 3309.04
dumb [ __ ]

3305.599 --> 3311.28
but he was like really about like pop-up

3309.04 --> 3314.88
sounds and things a lot and like

3311.28 --> 3314.88
everybody started copying him

3317.599 --> 3322.0
and that's what he's really popular for

3319.76 --> 3324.2400000000002
it was in the time when suddenly also

3322.0 --> 3328.319
people started to like

3324.24 --> 3331.81
or young kids really got into watching

3328.319 --> 3333.04
other people play video games

3331.81 --> 3335.2
[Music]

3333.04 --> 3339.2
when that all got popular all of a

3335.2 --> 3342.48
sudden that's the age of pewdiepie

3339.2 --> 3342.48
because he did that a lot

3343.2 --> 3347.359
and that's why for example d live is

3345.44 --> 3350.7200000000003
filled with just kind of

3347.359 --> 3352.4
people playing video games

3350.72 --> 3354.48
i think it's time is

3352.4 --> 3357.28
pretty much over though i mean nobody

3354.48 --> 3358.64
gives a [ __ ] anymore i mean everybody's

3357.28 --> 3361.6400000000003
going to get bored of doing that

3358.64 --> 3361.64
eventually

3363.2 --> 3368.839
what's your take on the hose

3365.839 --> 3368.839
what

3390.559 --> 3395.119
that's how i came to know about the dork

3402.839 --> 3408.64
gonzalez already addressed it

3406.16 --> 3411.52
a while ago i mean

3408.64 --> 3411.52
he's just a

3412.16 --> 3415.839
goofy

3413.28 --> 3417.8390000000004
kind of like online entertainment guy

3415.839 --> 3421.359
and he's

3417.839 --> 3422.96
likes to hurt ballers

3421.359 --> 3424.64
but i mean

3422.96 --> 3426.96
he's not like

3424.64 --> 3428.96
full in anti-flat earth or he's not like

3426.96 --> 3431.44
a math nerd or anything he's he's

3428.96 --> 3433.599
basically not that interested

3431.44 --> 3436.319
in like in a religious way like most

3433.599 --> 3439.119
anti-flat earthers but he does entertain

3436.319 --> 3440.48
anti-flat earthers

3439.119 --> 3443.28
it's like

3440.48 --> 3443.28
he is like

3443.92 --> 3450.16
the mexican

3445.599 --> 3452.799
that is being out used to outsource

3450.16 --> 3455.5989999999997
elderly care for the

3452.799 --> 3457.44
the baller insane basically that's what

3455.599 --> 3458.799
it really feels like it's just the guy

3457.44 --> 3460.64
that's just

3458.799 --> 3463.599
doing that and everybody

3460.64 --> 3465.44
yeah it's like a retirement home for for

3463.599 --> 3467.2000000000003
insane ballers

3465.44 --> 3469.44
and he does it pretty well and he finds

3467.2 --> 3471.52
it very entertaining and if he get can

3469.44 --> 3473.52
can make a living out of it i'm all for

3471.52 --> 3476.0
it i mean

3473.52 --> 3478.559
yeah josie can be jose can be a bit of a

3476.0 --> 3481.68
backstabber sometimes

3478.559 --> 3484.0
and he is

3481.68 --> 3486.64
like not a super good guy

3484.0 --> 3489.839
but at least like he's got

3486.64 --> 3492.48
just some sort of

3489.839 --> 3492.48
god that's

3492.559 --> 3494.7200000000003
no

3495.119 --> 3499.599
i was gonna say he has a sort of social

3497.28 --> 3502.559
justice thing going but yeah that word

3499.599 --> 3505.119
combination does not work out anymore

3502.559 --> 3508.4
he's just he's a sociable guy he is

3505.119 --> 3511.44
sensitive to people's feelings

3508.4 --> 3514.319
but he's not super invested

3511.44 --> 3515.44
in like the technicals of flat earth or

3514.319 --> 3518.5589999999997
ball earth

3515.44 --> 3520.96
he is more invested in the the social

3518.559 --> 3523.28
thing i guess he's like a social guy

3520.96 --> 3525.359
who's like into nerds or something that

3523.28 --> 3526.88
that's really what he is i think

3525.359 --> 3529.04
he lives in florida it doesn't matter

3526.88 --> 3531.839
where he lives

3529.04 --> 3531.839
i mean

3536.0 --> 3541.28
he is effectively like a mexican even

3538.4 --> 3541.28
though he isn't one

3541.44 --> 3545.68
he

3542.319 --> 3548.799
come on he doesn't he

3545.68 --> 3548.799
i shouldn't say more

3554.559 --> 3559.52
right but even yeah

3557.119 --> 3562.0
i called him third world trash to his

3559.52 --> 3562.96
face one time i think it's like the last

3562.0 --> 3565.28
or the

3562.96 --> 3568.0
before last time i got on there

3565.28 --> 3570.079
because i do sometimes visit his streams

3568.0 --> 3571.76
and just

3570.079 --> 3574.319
yeah

3571.76 --> 3576.2400000000002
get on the show because i can and he

3574.319 --> 3579.04
allows me and he retreats me with

3576.24 --> 3580.319
respect i mean he is literally the only

3579.04 --> 3582.4
guy

3580.319 --> 3585.52
that isn't just a flat earther that

3582.4 --> 3588.2400000000002
actually treats me with respect guys

3585.52 --> 3591.52
like i've never been treated with any

3588.24 --> 3594.16
sort equal level respect from any other

3591.52 --> 3595.2
baller ever

3594.16 --> 3596.72
so

3595.2 --> 3599.52
like i will

3596.72 --> 3603.5989999999997
go on his show and i will have some fun

3599.52 --> 3606.079
with it i will never ever go again

3603.599 --> 3609.28
because i was on there once on mr

3606.079 --> 3613.119
sensible or conspiracy cats or fight to

3609.28 --> 3615.6800000000003
flat earth like no [ __ ] way jose yeah

3613.119 --> 3616.6400000000003
sure if i feel like it i'll do it why

3615.68 --> 3619.2799999999997
not

3616.64 --> 3619.2799999999997
could be fun

3624.72 --> 3629.839
he wants to be a nerd that no no he

3627.52 --> 3630.72
doesn't he is a nerd type he knows he

3629.839 --> 3632.88
isn't

3630.72 --> 3636.24
he just likes to hang around with nerds

3632.88 --> 3640.28
and i totally get that because

3636.24 --> 3640.2799999999997
i'm like that too

3643.28 --> 3647.92
you know i've hung around with

3645.52 --> 3649.119
programmers

3647.92 --> 3652.48
and all that

3649.119 --> 3652.48
pretty much my entire life

3653.92 --> 3657.92
like people that are into psychology

3656.16 --> 3659.2799999999997
computers

3657.92 --> 3662.16
sci-fi

3659.28 --> 3665.599
i've always liked those people

3662.16 --> 3668.72
i've always been drawn to that

3665.599 --> 3671.04
and i think he is too but i am not a

3668.72 --> 3674.04
math guy right and i don't know how to

3671.04 --> 3674.04
program

3689.2 --> 3691.4399999999996
um

3696.88 --> 3700.6400000000003
okay gta

3698.799 --> 3705.44
yeah i don't know why he does that i

3700.64 --> 3707.2799999999997
don't like that he does that terra 306

3705.44 --> 3710.2400000000002
i i don't know like and i think he's

3707.28 --> 3713.599
actually playing that

3710.24 --> 3715.5989999999997
during the live show

3713.599 --> 3718.559
i don't know why he does that i think

3715.599 --> 3718.559
it's a waste of time

3721.2 --> 3725.64
nerds are adorably smart

3726.319 --> 3732.16
well they're really good at what they do

3729.359 --> 3734.48
i wouldn't like call them smart because

3732.16 --> 3735.68
they're just really good with certain

3734.48 --> 3738.2400000000002
things

3735.68 --> 3741.24
in other things they're really really

3738.24 --> 3741.24
terrible

3745.76 --> 3752.039
can you move my uglies yeah i know that

3748.24 --> 3752.0389999999998
tarret i know

3756.88 --> 3762.28
okay see you later pgcnet take it easy

3773.44 --> 3777.68
yeah i know rick back that's why i like

3775.52 --> 3779.92
it too you're like a circle of friends

3777.68 --> 3781.0389999999998
and we're here to do something we're

3779.92 --> 3785.119
here

3781.039 --> 3787.76
with with objectives in mind

3785.119 --> 3790.7200000000003
and wear a workshop like an idea

3787.76 --> 3791.76
workshop or if you will a public think

3790.72 --> 3794.5589999999997
tank

3791.76 --> 3797.28
that's what i like this show to be it's

3794.559 --> 3798.88
what i do and it's great that there's

3797.28 --> 3800.96
other people that i can have this

3798.88 --> 3802.799
interactive chemistry with because that

3800.96 --> 3805.52
really gets me going

3802.799 --> 3807.0389999999998
it's very stimulating and

3805.52 --> 3810.079
and support

3807.039 --> 3812.2400000000002
keeps it all going right

3810.079 --> 3814.88
so yeah i like it too and i really like

3812.24 --> 3818.0789999999997
you guys and look at how many

3814.88 --> 3820.48
of you guys we've gathered

3818.079 --> 3822.2400000000002
how many ranches are even

3820.48 --> 3824.559
passed out by now

3822.24 --> 3826.9599999999996
like solid ranches ranches that i'm not

3824.559 --> 3830.079
sorry about

3826.96 --> 3830.079
it's awesome i mean

3831.839 --> 3835.0789999999997
let's see

3851.039 --> 3853.8390000000004
yeah there's

3853.92 --> 3856.2400000000002
eight

3856.64 --> 3862.24
eight ranches

3858.88 --> 3863.599
eight ranches are in here

3862.24 --> 3866.4799999999996
and you've guys been hanging around

3863.599 --> 3868.88
forever

3866.48 --> 3870.799
and you all know each other by now and

3868.88 --> 3872.1600000000003
you know everybody's slightly different

3870.799 --> 3875.839
everybody

3872.16 --> 3878.24
has their own weird little

3875.839 --> 3879.68
personal traits that are slightly

3878.24 --> 3882.16
different

3879.68 --> 3884.319
different response different thresholds

3882.16 --> 3887.7599999999998
different attention spans and also

3884.319 --> 3890.0
different wave of oscillation

3887.76 --> 3892.7990000000004
to which you are attuned

3890.0 --> 3894.559
different patterns

3892.799 --> 3896.48
and we're all learning it of each other

3894.559 --> 3898.48
we're just getting to learn each other's

3896.48 --> 3901.2
rhythms which is typically by the way

3898.48 --> 3903.52
what friend circles do that hang around

3901.2 --> 3906.24
is to literally get to know that part

3903.52 --> 3906.24
about each other

3907.76 --> 3912.3190000000004
been here since childhood

3910.079 --> 3912.319
what

3918.799 --> 3923.599
brain waves

3921.44 --> 3926.4
well brain waves know

3923.599 --> 3926.4
it's energy

3927.68 --> 3931.9199999999996
it's just the energies that that we are

3929.92 --> 3934.16
being subjected to

3931.92 --> 3938.0
everybody

3934.16 --> 3939.68
it is god's energy it's like what what

3938.0 --> 3941.28
is what you're going to have available

3939.68 --> 3943.839
for the day

3941.28 --> 3943.8390000000004
here it is

3944.4 --> 3950.4
and everybody shares the same waves but

3948.319 --> 3952.799
people attune to different types of

3950.4 --> 3954.64
frequency of operation

3952.799 --> 3956.88
will have different

3954.64 --> 3960.319
slightly different or completely

3956.88 --> 3962.2400000000002
different responses to such energy wave

3960.319 --> 3964.48
changes so everybody sitting in their

3962.24 --> 3966.5589999999997
own frequency

3964.48 --> 3967.839
is gonna potentially have a different

3966.559 --> 3970.48
response

3967.839 --> 3972.319
to when the waves pass by and this is

3970.48 --> 3975.039
something that i pay a lot of attention

3972.319 --> 3976.16
to that's why i literally name it when

3975.039 --> 3978.1600000000003
it happens

3976.16 --> 3979.92
like thursday it was like oh my god i'm

3978.16 --> 3981.5989999999997
so freaking rowdy today i know

3979.92 --> 3984.2400000000002
everybody's going to be like this

3981.599 --> 3985.76
because every time i've been like that

3984.24 --> 3987.839
like thursday

3985.76 --> 3990.559
i always

3987.839 --> 3992.48
i'm right about it everybody always does

3990.559 --> 3996.4
become rowdy like that on the flat earth

3992.48 --> 3998.72
debate and it did exactly like that

3996.4 --> 3999.839
i even basically held my tongue most of

3998.72 --> 4002.16
that show

3999.839 --> 4004.72
because i knew like if i'm gonna

4002.16 --> 4006.64
double down with my rowdiness

4004.72 --> 4008.72
then everybody's gonna get pissed off at

4006.64 --> 4010.48
me again they always like to pick me up

4008.72 --> 4011.5989999999997
when it's rowdy

4010.48 --> 4012.72
and i

4011.599 --> 4015.2000000000003
do that

4012.72 --> 4018.16
so i didn't do that

4015.2 --> 4021.2
turned out great why because i knew it

4018.16 --> 4024.48
was coming and i've had cross-referenced

4021.2 --> 4026.0
experience from the past to when that's

4024.48 --> 4029.28
happened

4026.0 --> 4031.28
so you can learn a lot

4029.28 --> 4033.3590000000004
just by doing the same things over and

4031.28 --> 4035.6800000000003
over again you don't learn new things

4033.359 --> 4038.799
about the actual things you do

4035.68 --> 4040.319
but you learn new things about

4038.799 --> 4042.799
the energies

4040.319 --> 4044.96
and the frequencies you're subjected to

4042.799 --> 4047.92
when typically doing that

4044.96 --> 4050.2400000000002
and how the influences alter what you're

4047.92 --> 4050.2400000000002
doing

4050.46 --> 4055.599
[Music]

4052.559 --> 4059.3190000000004
is dell coming back what did he go

4055.599 --> 4059.319
what are you talking about

4067.92 --> 4074.0
nathan's no nerd that's right he isn't a

4070.4 --> 4077.319
nerd he's a sound guy and a car guy

4074.0 --> 4077.319
not a nerd

4083.119 --> 4088.7200000000003
dell's gone what do you mean dale's gone

4086.16 --> 4091.839
his channels gone is not doing streams

4088.72 --> 4091.839
anymore what are you talking about

4098.319 --> 4102.400000000001
and his screw

4100.08 --> 4104.719
yeah well the crew getting sick they are

4102.4 --> 4106.5599999999995
nerds i should know

4104.719 --> 4110.159
i mean not everybody

4106.56 --> 4110.159000000001
but there's definitely nerds

4110.239 --> 4116.919999999999
a car guy i wouldn't call him that

4113.679 --> 4116.92
why not

4119.04 --> 4124.88
he likes talking about cars he knows a

4121.199 --> 4124.879999999999
lot of different things about cars

4126.159 --> 4130.2789999999995
i mean he is into cars

4134.159 --> 4139.599999999999
he has disappeared but his channel

4136.239 --> 4139.599999999999
hasn't disappeared right

4140.56 --> 4143.96
let me check

4146.159 --> 4150.239
by the way my subscribers are just kind

4148.159 --> 4152.0
of swinging around recently it's really

4150.239 --> 4154.08
weird

4152.0 --> 4155.279
i'm thinking that i'm gonna pass the two

4154.08 --> 4157.839
and a half

4155.279 --> 4160.319
k subscribers at some point but it's

4157.839 --> 4162.0
just kind of keep stuck at 2

4160.319 --> 4162.839000000001
0.44

4162.0 --> 4168.679
and

4162.839 --> 4168.679
2.456 and then back to 404 it's weird

4175.6 --> 4177.92
okay

4179.12 --> 4183.599999999999
nice channel still there all right he's

4181.12 --> 4187.2789999999995
just hasn't done any live stream for 10

4183.6 --> 4190.2390000000005
days he did have a couple of uploads of

4187.279 --> 4192.64
park interactions talking flat smacking

4190.239 --> 4192.639999999999
people

4194.48 --> 4198.08
so yeah his channel's not gone

4199.12 --> 4205.28
he's just out on the streets so yeah

4202.159 --> 4205.28
just let him do that

4207.84 --> 4214.679
i mean he's not a stream everyday guy

4211.44 --> 4214.678999999999
come on

4216.48 --> 4220.4
we want that that

4218.08 --> 4221.679
i'm here i'm doing a show every day

4220.4 --> 4223.839999999999
right

4221.679 --> 4225.6
i mean if i would be gone a week yeah i

4223.84 --> 4228.159000000001
totally get it if you say oh i see

4225.6 --> 4231.64
disappeared because i am here every day

4228.159 --> 4231.639999999999
dell is it

4240.0 --> 4244.48
a car salesman not a mechanic what did i

4242.08 --> 4246.96
say mechanic gideon sick

4244.48 --> 4250.4
did i say a mechanic no

4246.96 --> 4250.4
so a car salesman sure

4256.96 --> 4262.4800000000005
but he has been a salesman he's been a

4259.12 --> 4263.76
sound system salesman and

4262.48 --> 4267.4
yeah

4263.76 --> 4267.400000000001
that's the type

4311.36 --> 4315.799999999999
yes gideon's sick i got it

4319.92 --> 4325.4800000000005
you don't have to write a report about

4321.92 --> 4325.4800000000005
it in my chat

4361.6 --> 4364.400000000001
all right that's fine

4365.28 --> 4371.36
it is one of those days where a lot of

4367.52 --> 4374.320000000001
people are a little bit slow

4371.36 --> 4377.679
i don't feel slow but then again i might

4374.32 --> 4379.5199999999995
it's a weird thing so when you feel

4377.679 --> 4382.96
slow

4379.52 --> 4385.679
does that mean you're actually slow

4382.96 --> 4388.719
or does that mean you're actually sped

4385.679 --> 4391.04
up why everything seems slow to your

4388.719 --> 4392.88
senses because yeah your body is still

4391.04 --> 4394.239
going to function the way it does in the

4392.88 --> 4396.32
rhythm it does

4394.239 --> 4400.0
but if your consciousness is suddenly

4396.32 --> 4402.159
quicker than normal higher

4400.0 --> 4404.88
higher cycle

4402.159 --> 4406.159
then wouldn't you experience everything

4404.88 --> 4408.56
as

4406.159 --> 4408.5599999999995
slow

4410.96 --> 4416.8
yeah that's a bit of a

4413.199 --> 4416.799999999999
perception question i guess

4417.679 --> 4421.679
sometimes i feel slow but then a whole

4419.92 --> 4424.32
bunch of stuff comes rolling out of me

4421.679 --> 4425.36
and i'm not actually slow it just feels

4424.32 --> 4427.84
slow

4425.36 --> 4427.839999999999
weird

4428.08 --> 4431.6
just came from the gym okay

4434.239 --> 4437.44
i don't know what that's like

4439.52 --> 4444.080000000001
oh quick update all right all right

4442.08 --> 4446.239
great progress oh i'm so glad to hear

4444.08 --> 4446.239
that

4448.239 --> 4451.919999999999
face cleared up oh perfect

4453.6 --> 4457.280000000001
wow

4454.8 --> 4461.96
that's great news elisha i'm so happy to

4457.28 --> 4461.96
hear about that so happy man

4470.0 --> 4473.0
hmm

4498.4 --> 4501.36
yeah getting sick

4505.04 --> 4508.8
right

4506.08 --> 4510.96
but he was very optimistic right away so

4508.8 --> 4513.04
that's already a good sign

4510.96 --> 4514.4800000000005
and apparently he did

4513.04 --> 4516.64
he's going uh

4514.48 --> 4518.879999999999
to what seems towards almost full

4516.64 --> 4522.12
recovery so that's just really great i'm

4518.88 --> 4522.12
so happy

4532.239 --> 4535.239
hmm

4542.41 --> 4549.04
[Music]

4564.719 --> 4568.56
yeah right back yeah they can be

4574.239 --> 4579.48
the whole age is not for [ __ ] is it

4585.28 --> 4592.12
that's a odd thing to say but

4588.88 --> 4592.12
i guess

4594.0 --> 4597.04
all right brandon cook yeah thanks for

4595.84 --> 4600.4400000000005
popping by

4597.04 --> 4600.44
i see you around

4617.04 --> 4622.0
i think i'm gonna refresh the water for

4618.88 --> 4625.4800000000005
the birds for a bit sorry guys

4622.0 --> 4625.48
be right back

4647.6 --> 4650.6
uh

4660.48 --> 4663.48
uh

4826.32 --> 4829.5599999999995
i'm back

4838.96 --> 4842.719
feeding the birds yeah but it's just

4840.719 --> 4846.52
water

4842.719 --> 4846.52
but it it yeah

4846.719 --> 4851.52
i really do like to give it to them

4849.679 --> 4853.4400000000005
and they really do appreciate it but

4851.52 --> 4855.4400000000005
it's mostly because i put water out

4853.44 --> 4858.32
there that also just

4855.44 --> 4860.638999999999
that flock of white pigeons

4858.32 --> 4862.719
of white doves like eight of them that

4860.639 --> 4864.2390000000005
they come by a lot and i really like

4862.719 --> 4867.4800000000005
that

4864.239 --> 4867.48
they're beautiful

4886.4 --> 4892.159
wood pigeons they're cooing is very

4888.96 --> 4892.159
human sounding what

4895.44 --> 4900.5599999999995
really

4897.6 --> 4902.159000000001
if i haven't been to a falconry center

4900.56 --> 4904.56
yeah

4902.159 --> 4906.4
yeah i did once actually

4904.56 --> 4910.639
it was

4906.4 --> 4913.5199999999995
it wasn't like a gardening center

4910.639 --> 4916.08
in the city that i used to live with

4913.52 --> 4917.679
with my ex

4916.08 --> 4921.76
where we went there and there was

4917.679 --> 4923.6
literally a falconer there one time

4921.76 --> 4927.52
it was pretty cool

4923.6 --> 4930.639
and i think i'd like a uh

4927.52 --> 4932.88
like a renaissance fair thing

4930.639 --> 4937.76
also with larp and reenactments and all

4932.88 --> 4937.76
that it it had a falconer one time

4937.92 --> 4941.28
a falconry person

4942.84 --> 4948.56
yeah and they're taking a bath

4945.84 --> 4950.8
immediately

4948.56 --> 4953.360000000001
just had to do it

4950.8 --> 4956.360000000001
both of them are immediately doing it

4953.36 --> 4956.36
okay

4958.0 --> 4962.159
guess that makes sense they don't really

4960.08 --> 4964.08
need to drink as much water as there has

4962.159 --> 4966.08
been plenty around

4964.08 --> 4969.8
but they do still really like taking a

4966.08 --> 4969.8
bath in that thing

4973.12 --> 4977.5199999999995
they don't like being filmed while

4974.8 --> 4977.52
taking a bath

4977.6 --> 4980.76
i guess

4986.159 --> 4989.159
um

5000.88 --> 5004.639
oh

5002.4 --> 5008.4
huh

5004.639 --> 5008.400000000001
yeah that sounds pretty cool is she

5010.08 --> 5013.5199999999995
yeah

5011.12 --> 5016.4
camera helmets for falcons that sounds

5013.52 --> 5016.400000000001
really interesting

5022.08 --> 5025.199
the connection they have with their

5023.199 --> 5027.678999999999
birds almost no it is spiritual it's not

5025.199 --> 5029.44
almost spiritual it is spiritual and i

5027.679 --> 5032.4800000000005
can attend to that because

5029.44 --> 5032.48
i have a bit of

5037.52 --> 5041.360000000001
let's see if i can sneak attack them

5041.6 --> 5044.639
i'm not watching you take that bird bath

5043.76 --> 5046.88
oh

5044.639 --> 5048.639
oh and they go away again

5046.88 --> 5049.92
see

5048.639 --> 5052.719
it's like

5049.92 --> 5054.4800000000005
they're secretly having this bad bath

5052.719 --> 5058.2390000000005
pleasure

5054.48 --> 5058.239
they know that i'm watching

5067.679 --> 5072.2390000000005
no but i

5068.84 --> 5074.96
feel a connection too

5072.239 --> 5074.959999999999
with the birds

5075.679 --> 5081.1990000000005
like i can feel what they feel like i

5078.159 --> 5082.4
can feel their subtle senses like

5081.199 --> 5083.759999999999
touching

5082.4 --> 5087.199
things

5083.76 --> 5090.4800000000005
i can feel when they are aware of my

5087.199 --> 5093.28
presence i can literally feel them

5090.48 --> 5096.08
staring at me

5093.28 --> 5097.36
just like they can feel me staring at

5096.08 --> 5099.84
them

5097.36 --> 5101.839999999999
sometimes you have to be really sneaky

5099.84 --> 5104.8
just to take a peek like from behind the

5101.84 --> 5106.8
curtain like to just and then like they

5104.8 --> 5110.4800000000005
still will figure out that i'm watching

5106.8 --> 5110.4800000000005
even though they can barely see me it's

5111.76 --> 5118.1990000000005
but yeah there's spiritual connection

5114.639 --> 5118.1990000000005
with birds definitely

5131.679 --> 5134.88
wow

5133.92 --> 5137.679
they

5134.88 --> 5140.96
did you just get here just to deplete

5137.679 --> 5143.1990000000005
all the water from bathing

5140.96 --> 5145.679
because if that's the case then

5143.199 --> 5147.678999999999
wow they really are they're just bathing

5145.679 --> 5149.6
it until it's all gone

5147.679 --> 5151.52
so i guess they didn't really care for

5149.6 --> 5152.88
the drinking water they just wanted to

5151.52 --> 5154.4800000000005
bathe there

5152.88 --> 5158.08
okay fine

5154.48 --> 5158.08
i'm gonna refresh it right away

5165.6 --> 5168.92
what's that

5172.4 --> 5177.4
oh

5174.4 --> 5177.4
huh

5205.199 --> 5207.919999999999
oh wow

5206.32 --> 5211.84
yeah i'm scrolling through that and the

5207.92 --> 5211.84
falcon is like trying to

5212.8 --> 5217.04
catch

5214.239 --> 5219.44
his backpack

5217.04 --> 5221.28
or that pack on his back what and he

5219.44 --> 5223.599999999999
caught it

5221.28 --> 5226.88
what

5223.6 --> 5226.88
is there like prey in that

5228.96 --> 5231.36
weird

5233.76 --> 5236.76
interesting

5246.48 --> 5251.599999999999
that connection isn't physical

5249.199 --> 5254.159
roof reality isn't physical what the

5251.6 --> 5257.76
hell are you talking about

5254.159 --> 5257.759999999999
no it's a spiritual connection

5258.32 --> 5262.08
yeah we com we're comprised of both we

5260.639 --> 5264.08
have a spirit

5262.08 --> 5267.679
of spirit connection which is

5264.08 --> 5269.76
non-material through god

5267.679 --> 5273.28
with god

5269.76 --> 5276.8
and then we have the physical

5273.28 --> 5279.36
part that is also there yeah

5276.8 --> 5281.04
a spiritual connection doesn't prove

5279.36 --> 5284.88
reality isn't physical that's a

5281.04 --> 5284.88
ridiculous statement rigbeck

5285.12 --> 5289.04
it just means there's more than just

5287.12 --> 5292.36
physical substance

5289.04 --> 5292.36
to reality

5296.56 --> 5301.6
oh you love joking

5298.32 --> 5304.4
about that with me oh yes i remember

5301.6 --> 5306.08
yeah i don't care i'm going to literally

5304.4 --> 5307.599999999999
answer everything you say even if it's

5306.08 --> 5310.32
going to be a joke whether it's

5307.6 --> 5312.400000000001
sarcastic or literal

5310.32 --> 5314.639
because i can't tell the part when you

5312.4 --> 5316.879999999999
guys are joking sometimes i really can

5314.639 --> 5320.6
so i'm just going to literally

5316.88 --> 5320.6
answer it exactly

5337.199 --> 5342.86
okay and uh yeah you disagreeing

5341.52 --> 5345.120000000001
doesn't do anything

5342.86 --> 5347.599999999999
[Music]

5345.12 --> 5350.719
you have not delivered proof

5347.6 --> 5352.88
of your statement yeah a connection a

5350.719 --> 5355.36
spiritual connection beyond the physical

5352.88 --> 5356.56
does not prove physical reality isn't

5355.36 --> 5359.44
real

5356.56 --> 5359.4400000000005
that's ridiculous

5360.32 --> 5363.639
that's like

5364.159 --> 5369.839999999999
now i just barely can even compare that

5367.04 --> 5369.84
to anything else

5377.199 --> 5383.12
want us to believe yeah

5379.52 --> 5385.120000000001
right that's the materialist right

5383.12 --> 5386.96
patricia what that describes is a

5385.12 --> 5388.4
materialist they just think no the

5386.96 --> 5390.4800000000005
physical body is the only thing there is

5388.4 --> 5392.799999999999
no spirit even though they're constantly

5390.48 --> 5395.839999999999
using it and they're constantly

5392.8 --> 5398.0
even applying it they're just in denial

5395.84 --> 5400.32
of what they really apply it's like yeah

5398.0 --> 5402.0
we constantly use god we just but god

5400.32 --> 5404.08
doesn't exist

5402.0 --> 5404.88
right like that

5404.08 --> 5407.199
that's

5404.88 --> 5409.12
materialism which is ridiculous and

5407.199 --> 5411.839999999999
[ __ ]

5409.12 --> 5411.84
and stumped

5412.0 --> 5417.12
but the opposite is equally delusional

5416.239 --> 5420.48
yeah

5417.12 --> 5423.36
physical reality is not an illusion it

5420.48 --> 5426.159
is not illusory

5423.36 --> 5429.599999999999
it is not similar it's not a literal

5426.159 --> 5431.839999999999
simulation something that is created for

5429.6 --> 5434.0
our spirits to experience which isn't

5431.84 --> 5438.08
real no it is real it's the physical

5434.0 --> 5440.719
reality it's the one physical reality

5438.08 --> 5443.44
that is physically real

5440.719 --> 5446.32
and our spirits can dwell here interact

5443.44 --> 5447.5199999999995
with it reflect upon it

5446.32 --> 5449.44
and

5447.52 --> 5453.280000000001
do what spirit do

5449.44 --> 5453.28
in reflection to the material

5453.36 --> 5457.639
physical reality is real

5458.67 --> 5466.629
[Music]

5475.12 --> 5482.48
what

5477.84 --> 5484.96
physical is cause in effect what rate

5482.48 --> 5489.0
what are you saying getting sick

5484.96 --> 5489.0
get your spelling in order

5500.08 --> 5505.44
define physical

5502.84 --> 5509.2390000000005
something that can be physically

5505.44 --> 5509.239
interacted with

5528.239 --> 5533.48
then define spiritual

5530.48 --> 5533.48
okay

5534.0 --> 5537.76
the non-material

5536.96 --> 5539.92
that

5537.76 --> 5542.639
we can prove

5539.92 --> 5542.639
connects us

5544.719 --> 5547.719
right

5548.0 --> 5553.12
things that we can pick up just through

5549.76 --> 5554.8
our spirit it's basically the other side

5553.12 --> 5556.719
everything that's spiritual is

5554.8 --> 5558.320000000001
everything that we experience through

5556.719 --> 5560.4800000000005
our own

5558.32 --> 5564.32
spirit and our consciousness and our

5560.48 --> 5564.32
dreams that's spiritual

5564.48 --> 5569.12
physical is what we can physically

5566.4 --> 5569.12
interact with

5572.239 --> 5577.199
it's ridiculous no it's ridiculous to

5574.8 --> 5579.12
think they're the same thing greg beck

5577.199 --> 5580.638999999999
that's like saying yeah dreams and

5579.12 --> 5584.159
physical reality

5580.639 --> 5588.56
like waking life is exactly the same

5584.159 --> 5592.5599999999995
no it isn't blatantly obviously isn't

5588.56 --> 5595.280000000001
yeah so it's just ridiculous to say that

5592.56 --> 5598.92
you have no standing

5595.28 --> 5598.92
for such a statement

5630.56 --> 5632.8
what

5633.6 --> 5636.719
i don't know what that means

5640.08 --> 5645.84
out of body experiences

5642.32 --> 5645.84
can't you just spell that out

5661.199 --> 5665.04
everything is a reflection apart from

5663.199 --> 5669.36
the spirit

5665.04 --> 5669.36
oh apart from the spirit you say

5669.44 --> 5674.239
apart so

5671.44 --> 5676.96
not the same then

5674.239 --> 5679.759999999999
if you're literally saying apart

5676.96 --> 5681.84
you immediately invoke

5679.76 --> 5683.84
well apart

5681.84 --> 5687.6
not together

5683.84 --> 5691.159000000001
disconnected separate

5687.6 --> 5691.159000000001
you said it

5701.36 --> 5706.239
and it is it's right getting sick

5703.04 --> 5706.239
getting sick is right here

5707.199 --> 5712.239
two different factors stay open

5726.239 --> 5731.839999999999
the physical model is a why

5729.36 --> 5733.92
why because you can't interact with it

5731.84 --> 5736.2390000000005
through your sensories which is how we

5733.92 --> 5737.1990000000005
interact with it

5736.239 --> 5739.759999999999
no

5737.199 --> 5743.599999999999
that's like saying oh man i'm closing my

5739.76 --> 5746.400000000001
eyes that immediately proves if i just

5743.6 --> 5749.280000000001
close my eyes then suddenly

5746.4 --> 5752.08
just light doesn't exist anymore it's

5749.28 --> 5753.759999999999
just it it never was there because i

5752.08 --> 5755.76
only have to close my eyes and it just

5753.76 --> 5758.159000000001
doesn't exist anymore

5755.76 --> 5761.679
what are you doing rig back could you

5758.159 --> 5763.759999999999
please stop acting like kind of

5761.679 --> 5765.679
like

5763.76 --> 5767.360000000001
this is teenage philosophizing what

5765.679 --> 5769.36
you're doing it's ridiculous i used to

5767.36 --> 5772.159
think like that sometimes too

5769.36 --> 5774.159
i stop doing that because it is

5772.159 --> 5776.879999999999
ridiculous

5774.159 --> 5779.679
no physical is not just energy physical

5776.88 --> 5782.32
is physical

5779.679 --> 5783.84
stop being a refined numpty [ __ ]

5782.32 --> 5785.28
you're starting to sound like an

5783.84 --> 5788.88
etherean

5785.28 --> 5788.88
it's ridiculous to say that

5795.199 --> 5799.839999999999
you have no standing no you don't have

5797.44 --> 5804.5599999999995
any standing i have

5799.84 --> 5807.679
a full life of active dedicated willful

5804.56 --> 5812.159000000001
and knowing study of this [ __ ]

5807.679 --> 5814.8
yeah starting 30 years ago 30.

5812.159 --> 5816.48
i've done this all my life figuring this

5814.8 --> 5817.360000000001
out i wrote

5816.48 --> 5820.08
like

5817.36 --> 5821.759999999999
an unofficial thesis about it pretty

5820.08 --> 5824.719
much

5821.76 --> 5827.1990000000005
like what is it now

5824.719 --> 5828.96
15 years ago

5827.199 --> 5830.799999999999
on a website that i share regularly

5828.96 --> 5831.6
symbolics that i know what i'm talking

5830.8 --> 5833.52
about

5831.6 --> 5835.6
you're wrong

5833.52 --> 5837.119000000001
if you close your eyes reality doesn't

5835.6 --> 5839.360000000001
go away

5837.119 --> 5840.48
we are separate spirit and physical

5839.36 --> 5842.48
they're both

5840.48 --> 5844.718999999999
physical can exist without their spirit

5842.48 --> 5847.28
if your spirit goes away and you can't

5844.719 --> 5848.8
see reality anymore doesn't mean it goes

5847.28 --> 5850.159
away it just means you don't you're not

5848.8 --> 5853.119000000001
there to see it

5850.159 --> 5854.48
anymore it is there because it is real

5853.119 --> 5857.119
it's physical

5854.48 --> 5859.44
it is repeatable

5857.119 --> 5862.48
interactable

5859.44 --> 5863.44
yeah and generation after generation

5862.48 --> 5865.5199999999995
can

5863.44 --> 5866.879999999999
experience it and come to the same

5865.52 --> 5868.4800000000005
conclusion

5866.88 --> 5872.32
even though those that have experienced

5868.48 --> 5874.5599999999995
it before them are no longer there

5872.32 --> 5876.96
it is the place that our spirit goes and

5874.56 --> 5879.84
it is a place

5876.96 --> 5881.52
it is real the physical reality is real

5879.84 --> 5883.04
we're here through our bodies to

5881.52 --> 5885.280000000001
experience it

5883.04 --> 5886.88
doesn't mean it's the only thing we can

5885.28 --> 5889.119
experience because our spirit can

5886.88 --> 5892.719
definitely experience things

5889.119 --> 5894.719
without the physical vessel that we use

5892.719 --> 5897.04
right but it is always going to reflect

5894.719 --> 5899.28
upon everything that we have experienced

5897.04 --> 5900.639
in the physical reality

5899.28 --> 5905.28
because

5900.639 --> 5906.88
spiritual existence cannot exist

5905.28 --> 5910.96
without

5906.88 --> 5914.4800000000005
physical interactions in order to form

5910.96 --> 5918.4
the very vision and ideas

5914.48 --> 5921.599999999999
and formation of conception of reality

5918.4 --> 5925.119
within the spiritual dreams and all that

5921.6 --> 5928.88
that can't even form if you don't have a

5925.119 --> 5931.759999999999
physical vessel to attain a palette for

5928.88 --> 5934.2390000000005
reflecting upon for your spirit outside

5931.76 --> 5935.6
of it i've tried to tell everybody this

5934.239 --> 5936.638999999999
for like

5935.6 --> 5939.679
weeks

5936.639 --> 5942.4800000000005
maybe months

5939.679 --> 5944.4800000000005
there's no physical reality to reflect

5942.48 --> 5946.08
upon with our spirit

5944.48 --> 5947.199
then what are you going to dream about

5946.08 --> 5948.5599999999995
outside

5947.199 --> 5950.719
what are you going to dream outside the

5948.56 --> 5953.679
physical reality nothing because you

5950.719 --> 5955.76
don't have anything to reflect upon it

5953.679 --> 5958.88
will just be nothing

5955.76 --> 5960.96
void emptiness no thing because you have

5958.88 --> 5964.08
no reflecting things

5960.96 --> 5966.719
you have nothing to conjure up with your

5964.08 --> 5968.96
imagination or however that works

5966.719 --> 5971.6
spiritual reflection board

5968.96 --> 5976.0
because you haven't experienced anything

5971.6 --> 5976.0
physical to fill it in with

5976.08 --> 5979.119
you're wrong

5978.08 --> 5982.32
really

5979.119 --> 5985.5199999999995
really wrong rick beck

5982.32 --> 5988.5599999999995
i cannot emphasize that enough how wrong

5985.52 --> 5988.56
you are about this

5991.36 --> 5994.96
you're going into

5992.84 --> 5997.6
solipsistic retreat mode this is

5994.96 --> 5997.6
ridiculous

5997.92 --> 6002.119
i'm losing respect here

6006.42 --> 6010.06
[Music]

6019.119 --> 6023.599999999999
you know i have no physical reality to

6021.28 --> 6025.84
reflect upon with your spirit

6023.6 --> 6028.4800000000005
and what are you gonna do without the

6025.84 --> 6031.4400000000005
physical reality there will literally be

6028.48 --> 6034.08
nothing to do there would just be

6031.44 --> 6038.08
and void and nothing

6034.08 --> 6040.48
no visual no sound no smell no touch

6038.08 --> 6043.119
nothing nothing to reflect upon no

6040.48 --> 6045.599999999999
conception that has taken shape within

6043.119 --> 6047.28
your mind in order to dream about the

6045.6 --> 6051.84
things that you've experienced

6047.28 --> 6051.84
physically which is all we ever do

6053.28 --> 6057.44
because the spiritual

6055.28 --> 6060.0
cannot exist

6057.44 --> 6061.839999999999
without the palette of physical

6060.0 --> 6065.36
experience

6061.84 --> 6068.96
to fill it in and that's a fact

6065.36 --> 6068.96
that's an absolutely

6069.239 --> 6077.599999999999
undisputable fact that nobody could ever

6074.08 --> 6080.0
counter as you know that's exactly what

6077.6 --> 6081.76
happens with every experience you've

6080.0 --> 6086.0
ever had

6081.76 --> 6088.56
every experience you've ever had

6086.0 --> 6089.84
and if you deny that then it's just that

6088.56 --> 6092.080000000001
denial

6089.84 --> 6094.5
it's you putting your blinders on

6092.08 --> 6097.68
because you don't want to know it

6094.5 --> 6097.68
[Music]

6103.36 --> 6108.4
oh turning around are we rigged back

6106.08 --> 6111.88
are you gonna take on the exact opposite

6108.4 --> 6111.879999999999
position huh

6150.8 --> 6156.719
you can't prove that yeah i can

6154.48 --> 6158.32
describe me anything you have ever

6156.719 --> 6161.92
experienced

6158.32 --> 6164.239
anything ever and can be whatever you

6161.92 --> 6167.04
you can literally try to find the most

6164.239 --> 6168.48
ridiculous surreal thing that you could

6167.04 --> 6170.639
ever think of

6168.48 --> 6173.04
you could literally make it up and lie

6170.639 --> 6175.1990000000005
about it anything you're gonna tell

6173.04 --> 6178.48
of anything you've ever experienced in

6175.199 --> 6180.879999999999
your life no matter how bizarre surreal

6178.48 --> 6184.879999999999
in your dream it doesn't matter

6180.88 --> 6188.4800000000005
as soon as you say it i will be able to

6184.88 --> 6191.679
point out how it is a reflection of a

6188.48 --> 6193.839999999999
physical reality-based experience that

6191.679 --> 6195.1990000000005
is being created

6193.84 --> 6197.6
within you

6195.199 --> 6200.799999999999
within that experience i can tell you

6197.6 --> 6202.84
everything everything you could ever say

6200.8 --> 6205.6
i can determinate

6202.84 --> 6209.4400000000005
it and show you exactly how it is

6205.6 --> 6209.4400000000005
derived from a physical experience

6213.6 --> 6217.52
lose respect for spirit no it's not

6215.6 --> 6219.84
losing respect for experiences is losing

6217.52 --> 6222.400000000001
respect for your intellect

6219.84 --> 6224.8
that should be able to distinguish what

6222.4 --> 6228.08
you're experiencing rig back

6224.8 --> 6228.08
this is what that's about

6230.88 --> 6234.88
subjective feeling yeah

6233.04 --> 6236.159
where do you think that's coming from

6234.88 --> 6240.2390000000005
getting sick where do you think a

6236.159 --> 6240.239
subjective feeling is coming from

6243.84 --> 6248.4800000000005
when do subjective feelings ever arrive

6249.199 --> 6251.119
is it

6250.32 --> 6253.119
with

6251.119 --> 6255.429999999999
a

6253.119 --> 6257.679
interaction

6255.43 --> 6260.96
[Music]

6257.679 --> 6263.6
interaction perhaps

6260.96 --> 6267.04
subjective so that means there is a a

6263.6 --> 6268.56
judgment involved why would you judge

6267.04 --> 6270.08
could it be

6268.56 --> 6272.88
that that's based in

6270.08 --> 6276.639
physical reality where you are

6272.88 --> 6278.96
engaging with something

6276.639 --> 6283.1990000000005
that you have a then lessened

6278.96 --> 6287.44
non-objective subjective viewpoint on

6283.199 --> 6291.5199999999995
subjective can only exist in relation to

6287.44 --> 6293.599999999999
physical reality based experiences

6291.52 --> 6297.119000000001
yeah i am treating you like a globber i

6293.6 --> 6300.2390000000005
exactly am doing that rick back

6297.119 --> 6303.4
because i think it's a very bad position

6300.239 --> 6303.4
to take

6304.0 --> 6308.56
you you literally think through what you

6307.04 --> 6310.88
said

6308.56 --> 6313.76
that reality isn't real you think it's

6310.88 --> 6315.28
all just a hologram it's all just

6313.76 --> 6318.159000000001
a simulation

6315.28 --> 6320.88
you're a semi simulation theorist yeah

6318.159 --> 6322.719
that's very very close

6320.88 --> 6324.159000000001
to a global

6322.719 --> 6326.719
in the depths

6324.159 --> 6328.799999999999
right in the depths of the philosophical

6326.719 --> 6331.28
philosophical grounds

6328.8 --> 6333.84
that is very close to a glober it is

6331.28 --> 6335.28
also going to lead to solipsism

6333.84 --> 6338.400000000001
inevitably

6335.28 --> 6338.4
just like globers do

6341.79 --> 6346.08
[Music]

6343.6 --> 6349.6
oh you've experienced physical reality

6346.08 --> 6349.6
without physical rules

6350.96 --> 6355.199
hmm

6352.239 --> 6355.199
could that be

6355.44 --> 6358.44
because

6358.719 --> 6364.2390000000005
you experienced physical reality

6361.679 --> 6367.28
with the physical rules and so because

6364.239 --> 6368.48
of that your spirit chooses to simulate

6367.28 --> 6370.719
that

6368.48 --> 6372.799999999999
but then taking out the rules

6370.719 --> 6376.88
some of the rules for your fantastical

6372.8 --> 6379.6
convenience could that be a reflection

6376.88 --> 6383.32
of the physical reality could it break

6379.6 --> 6383.320000000001
back could it

6387.6 --> 6391.84
i mean how are you gonna experience

6389.36 --> 6394.799999999999
physical reality without physical rules

6391.84 --> 6396.2390000000005
if there was no physical reality to base

6394.8 --> 6400.360000000001
that on

6396.239 --> 6400.36
for [ __ ] sake man

6404.8 --> 6408.96
yeah derp alert

6406.4 --> 6410.32
derpcon 2

6408.96 --> 6412.32
what are you going to do want to go back

6410.32 --> 6415.04
to the moon they never even went through

6412.32 --> 6417.679
the moon numpty [ __ ]

6415.04 --> 6420.159
don't you know they never went

6417.679 --> 6422.96
haven't you heard the actual astronaut

6420.159 --> 6424.96
that supposedly go went there tell the

6422.96 --> 6427.44
little girl how they didn't actually go

6424.96 --> 6429.84
and then he doesn't know why

6427.44 --> 6431.919999999999
also the story about how they can't go

6429.84 --> 6434.4800000000005
there yet because of the van allen

6431.92 --> 6436.159
radiation belt the numpty [ __ ]

6434.48 --> 6437.599999999999
they've already told you they haven't

6436.159 --> 6439.759999999999
gone how are you gonna go back to

6437.6 --> 6443.8
something that they've never went to

6439.76 --> 6443.8
by their own freaking admissions

6456.32 --> 6462.159
that's not what i think i assure you

6458.4 --> 6462.159
well then you're just incohesive

6463.28 --> 6468.239
you're just being incohesive you're

6465.36 --> 6470.48
philosophically stretching

6468.239 --> 6472.718999999999
to a place where you shouldn't go in my

6470.48 --> 6475.839999999999
opinion i tried to correct you and you

6472.719 --> 6478.639
persist like a stubborn teenager and now

6475.84 --> 6480.159000000001
you're false equivocating

6478.639 --> 6481.92
everything that i've said

6480.159 --> 6484.48
i've never said that you're literally a

6481.92 --> 6486.56
baller that you're on the baller side i

6484.48 --> 6489.5199999999995
explained to you exactly what the

6486.56 --> 6491.84
correlation was between how how i treat

6489.52 --> 6494.2390000000005
ballers and where you're going and even

6491.84 --> 6496.639
how you have a similarity in where

6494.239 --> 6499.28
you're gonna end up inevitably because

6496.639 --> 6502.32
of your philosophical assumption

6499.28 --> 6504.719
yeah solipsism i told you i told you

6502.32 --> 6507.92
everything the complete package of

6504.719 --> 6510.32
judgment i gave it everything to you

6507.92 --> 6513.1990000000005
everything you're saying now is just

6510.32 --> 6515.04
you just wobbling it around it doesn't

6513.199 --> 6516.719
make any sense anymore what you're

6515.04 --> 6519.28
saying right now

6516.719 --> 6519.28
break back

6523.28 --> 6528.88
every plane of reality

6525.52 --> 6532.400000000001
is absolutely necessary yeah

6528.88 --> 6535.119
that includes the physical material

6532.4 --> 6538.879999999999
reality that exists

6535.119 --> 6544.159
even without our spirit it exists

6538.88 --> 6544.159000000001
it is physically there separate from us

6545.76 --> 6550.56
yeah it's not a simulation it's not just

6548.239 --> 6554.638999999999
something our spirits experience it's a

6550.56 --> 6557.119000000001
physical place that we can enter

6554.639 --> 6559.76
with our spirit

6557.119 --> 6562.0
it's called having a body

6559.76 --> 6564.4800000000005
and interacting with the physical

6562.0 --> 6566.08
reality through the sensories of our

6564.48 --> 6568.4
body

6566.08 --> 6569.92
it's physically real it's physically

6568.4 --> 6572.4
there

6569.92 --> 6573.679
it's not a simulation it's not just all

6572.4 --> 6576.96
in our minds

6573.679 --> 6576.96
that's horseshit

6577.599 --> 6581.4800000000005
it's objective indeed

6584.56 --> 6590.2390000000005
they never went because it falls in line

6587.36 --> 6590.239
with your flirt

6591.28 --> 6596.48
oh you're so smart

6593.84 --> 6598.0
so smart yeah

6596.48 --> 6599.119
yeah that's the reason why they never

6598.0 --> 6602.159
went

6599.119 --> 6604.0
i mean it's only on camera admitted by

6602.159 --> 6605.839999999999
people allegedly having gone there

6604.0 --> 6608.96
yanamti [ __ ]

6605.84 --> 6611.52
it has nothing to do with flurfs

6608.96 --> 6616.84
their admission on camera has nothing to

6611.52 --> 6616.84
do with what we do numpty [ __ ]

6620.75 --> 6623.939

6625.76 --> 6628.76
uh

6634.03 --> 6639.449
[Music]

6639.76 --> 6643.52
give you a break no

6641.679 --> 6645.52
no rig back no

6643.52 --> 6647.040000000001
that's not the problem the problem isn't

6645.52 --> 6649.360000000001
that

6647.04 --> 6652.56
you have trouble communicating no no i

6649.36 --> 6653.92
am quite directly interfacing with you

6652.56 --> 6657.679
right now

6653.92 --> 6660.4800000000005
yeah beyond the text how do i do that

6657.679 --> 6662.639
it's called fractal thinking

6660.48 --> 6665.199
i'm literally reading your words beyond

6662.639 --> 6667.679
probably what you think you're saying

6665.199 --> 6671.678999999999
that's what i do

6667.679 --> 6671.679
communication is not the problem here

6675.04 --> 6678.88
it's what you're saying

6676.88 --> 6680.88
that's the problem what you said and

6678.88 --> 6682.4800000000005
you've already kind of weirdly turned

6680.88 --> 6684.2390000000005
that around now

6682.48 --> 6686.4
so there's not really a cohesive

6684.239 --> 6690.239
argument anymore to be made in that

6686.4 --> 6695.5599999999995
sense but you did literally say that

6690.239 --> 6695.5599999999995
and it is literally in the chat

6705.28 --> 6709.679
no that's not solipsism you don't seem

6707.52 --> 6711.280000000001
to know what solipsism is now you might

6709.679 --> 6714.96
want to google it before you make a

6711.28 --> 6714.96
ridiculous accusation like that

6716.239 --> 6722.119
you're you are getting ball or triggered

6718.08 --> 6722.119
now what a waste

6734.4 --> 6736.879999999999
yeah

6735.28 --> 6739.119
yeah i am

6736.88 --> 6742.96
if you don't like it if you you cannot

6739.119 --> 6742.96
handle that you can just leave

6745.52 --> 6750.0
but what was said was said

6747.44 --> 6751.678999999999
i've read into it you can't fool me

6750.0 --> 6754.08
you're not gonna gas like me and that

6751.679 --> 6755.84
i'm not fully understanding what you're

6754.08 --> 6757.76
saying because i know exactly what

6755.84 --> 6760.4800000000005
you're saying this is not the first

6757.76 --> 6762.400000000001
rodeo i've been on with you this is like

6760.48 --> 6764.48
the fourth time

6762.4 --> 6766.638999999999
in the last two years

6764.48 --> 6768.799999999999
i know who you are rick back i know how

6766.639 --> 6770.96
you work i know how you think you're a

6768.8 --> 6772.88
bit of a fantasist here and there

6770.96 --> 6775.119
and then when people point out very

6772.88 --> 6777.4400000000005
critical connections then you don't let

6775.119 --> 6780.0
go of your fantasy and that's a bit of a

6777.44 --> 6781.5199999999995
problem for you

6780.0 --> 6784.48
you're the one that stuck with that

6781.52 --> 6786.8
misconception you see not me

6784.48 --> 6788.08
i'm not misconceiving of what i'm

6786.8 --> 6791.8
reading

6788.08 --> 6791.8
about what you're saying

6792.88 --> 6798.08
but you cannot fool me just saying as a

6796.56 --> 6800.88
friend

6798.08 --> 6804.08
as a show host i'm just saying

6800.88 --> 6807.04
don't try it because it's not gonna work

6804.08 --> 6809.36
i've had like four years of life

6807.04 --> 6811.04
interacting with anti-flat earther

6809.36 --> 6813.839999999999
professionals

6811.04 --> 6815.44
okay you you can't fool me

6813.84 --> 6818.4800000000005
you might be able to fool yourself but

6815.44 --> 6818.48
you can't fool me

6819.44 --> 6822.638999999999
what is said is said

6820.96 --> 6825.119
you might change your mind but what is

6822.639 --> 6827.36
said is said you can't gaslight me about

6825.119 --> 6827.36
that

6829.04 --> 6833.56
hello rp-12 vacation

6838.63 --> 6841.85
[Music]

6847.76 --> 6850.719
yeah

6848.8 --> 6852.88
i'm not even gonna dignify what he just

6850.719 --> 6855.04
said with the response

6852.88 --> 6855.04
no

6855.44 --> 6861.32
just yield

6858.0 --> 6861.32
just yield

6866.719 --> 6871.36
all right you wanted to talk about it

6868.239 --> 6872.5599999999995
and we did and you did and i addressed

6871.36 --> 6874.639
critical

6872.56 --> 6877.119000000001
elements about it

6874.639 --> 6879.84
and then you wildly protested and and

6877.119 --> 6882.32
just switched around and just like no no

6879.84 --> 6884.400000000001
no no no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you

6882.32 --> 6886.4
did say that i did address it and then

6884.4 --> 6890.0
you did ignore that and completely

6886.4 --> 6892.239
change your vantage point

6890.0 --> 6894.239
and you're going the route as to no you

6892.239 --> 6896.5599999999995
just don't understand and it's not going

6894.239 --> 6898.5599999999995
to work on me because i do understand i

6896.56 --> 6901.88
understand you and i've understood what

6898.56 --> 6901.88
you said

6905.92 --> 6909.36
and it doesn't matter right i'm not

6907.76 --> 6911.84
hating on you

6909.36 --> 6911.839999999999
i'm just

6912.08 --> 6915.92
just exerting discipline here i'm just

6914.0 --> 6917.599
saying

6915.92 --> 6919.28
don't go there

6917.599 --> 6921.679
don't do that you're doing it to

6919.28 --> 6921.679
yourself

6921.76 --> 6927.360000000001
don't despise you but i will freaking

6924.719 --> 6930.08
point out when i see something that's

6927.36 --> 6933.5199999999995
wrong and i just will and you can't you

6930.08 --> 6936.32
can't change my mind about that

6933.52 --> 6940.400000000001
you could correct me if i were wrong you

6936.32 --> 6940.4
haven't because i am not wrong

6940.56 --> 6944.8
we've been going around here for like a

6942.719 --> 6947.84
half hour about this so

6944.8 --> 6947.84
if not more

6950.31 --> 6953.6990000000005
[Music]

6960.159 --> 6963.28
all right

6962.32 --> 6966.159
all right so

6963.28 --> 6968.639
don't be ashamed

6966.159 --> 6969.92
just don't be ashamed about it

6968.639 --> 6970.96
just let it

6969.92 --> 6973.04
let it

6970.96 --> 6974.63
hit let it get to you

6973.04 --> 6977.36
don't be ashamed

6974.63 --> 6980.32
[Music]

6977.36 --> 6982.96
right anybody can be wrong even at an

6980.32 --> 6984.719
older age even if you had a wild record

6982.96 --> 6988.0
of being correct about so many things

6984.719 --> 6990.4800000000005
you can still be incredibly wrong

6988.0 --> 6993.36
you need to deal with that i can be

6990.48 --> 6995.678999999999
incredibly wrong too sometimes

6993.36 --> 6998.639
even though i like to maniacally avoid

6995.679 --> 6998.639
that at this point

6999.04 --> 7002.4
right

7000.32 --> 7005.36
but when i am wrong and i figure that

7002.4 --> 7007.199
out then i'm all that eager to actually

7005.36 --> 7009.759999999999
embrace

7007.199 --> 7012.5599999999995
the learning moment and realize like

7009.76 --> 7014.719
yeah oh [ __ ] i really was wrong [ __ ] i

7012.56 --> 7016.88
hate it when that happens

7014.719 --> 7020.719
i'm absolutely gonna correct and then

7016.88 --> 7022.8
i'm gonna grow out of that temporary

7020.719 --> 7025.52
sensation of shame about being wrong

7022.8 --> 7027.1990000000005
about something and master the

7025.52 --> 7031.679
correction

7027.199 --> 7034.159
that's what i do every time

7031.679 --> 7036.4800000000005
you you might even be able to do that in

7034.159 --> 7038.48
a way

7036.48 --> 7039.839999999999
that people won't even realize that's

7038.48 --> 7044.119
what you've done

7039.84 --> 7044.119000000001
maybe everything will be good

7044.96 --> 7047.599
hey clutch

7048.719 --> 7053.52
nine o'clock still going yeah

7057.52 --> 7061.76
all right

7058.56 --> 7065.4400000000005
2 p.m amsterdam time to 4 p.m amsterdam

7061.76 --> 7065.4400000000005
time in the weekend so

7065.84 --> 7069.28
still

7067.04 --> 7073.84
yeah maybe a little overtime but yeah i

7069.28 --> 7073.84
started a little late i might go on

7081.92 --> 7088.0
imagining colorblind people there exist

7085.199 --> 7089.839999999999
things such as red yeah

7088.0 --> 7093.28
i have

7089.84 --> 7093.28
i know colorblind people

7095.199 --> 7097.44
right

7097.76 --> 7104.159000000001
they have a view in their mind they have

7101.199 --> 7106.239
a designation of what it is

7104.159 --> 7107.92
together with green because it's blended

7106.239 --> 7109.759999999999
in

7107.92 --> 7111.36
they see

7109.76 --> 7115.04
red and green

7111.36 --> 7118.96
as a singular thing which

7115.04 --> 7122.0
they typically would say is gray do you

7118.96 --> 7124.0
understand they see gray

7122.0 --> 7126.56
they don't see the red they don't see

7124.0 --> 7128.719
the green they see gray if you literally

7126.56 --> 7130.56
take a red and green image

7128.719 --> 7133.04
and then you take the

7130.56 --> 7134.4800000000005
the taken color out a gray version of

7133.04 --> 7137.04
that and you put it right next to it

7134.48 --> 7138.5599999999995
they will not be able to distinguish

7137.04 --> 7141.44
really

7138.56 --> 7142.56
so they see gray you can actually

7141.44 --> 7144.4
describe

7142.56 --> 7147.4400000000005
to a colorblind person

7144.4 --> 7150.48
what a color looks like

7147.44 --> 7152.719
when they can see it because they have a

7150.48 --> 7155.678999999999
storage capacity

7152.719 --> 7158.159
of how to interpret it it's different

7155.679 --> 7160.4800000000005
from everybody but they have something

7158.159 --> 7161.679
so you can definitely try to describe it

7160.48 --> 7164.919999999999
to them

7161.679 --> 7164.92
you can

7173.44 --> 7177.199
color cannot be communicated

7175.44 --> 7178.719
it can be described anything can be

7177.199 --> 7181.04
described

7178.719 --> 7183.36
feelings

7181.04 --> 7185.84
sights

7183.36 --> 7185.839999999999
smells

7185.92 --> 7190.56
anything can be described

7190.96 --> 7195.4
i don't know why you're even saying that

7198.4 --> 7203.28
a base descriptor oh so you're you're

7201.28 --> 7207.36
rolling it back you seem to be kind of

7203.28 --> 7210.88
oppositionally defiant now rick beck

7207.36 --> 7213.04
are you attaining teenage mode now

7210.88 --> 7215.84
are you gonna say no to everything that

7213.04 --> 7215.84
i suggest now

7216.88 --> 7220.0
i mean i don't mind going that road for

7218.96 --> 7223.199
a bit

7220.0 --> 7227.56
just warning you i do realize that that

7223.199 --> 7227.5599999999995
seems to be happening now so

7241.76 --> 7244.88
you color blindist

7243.92 --> 7246.2300000000005
sorry

7244.88 --> 7249.42
hilarious

7246.23 --> 7249.419999999999
[Music]

7273.44 --> 7278.799999999999
right i mean literally

7275.92 --> 7278.8
people have

7278.88 --> 7285.4400000000005
feeling associations that they can use

7281.84 --> 7288.0
to attempt to describe colors

7285.44 --> 7289.598999999999
people universally end up roughly doing

7288.0 --> 7291.52
the same thing

7289.599 --> 7294.719
so yeah you can

7291.52 --> 7296.56
actually describe a color

7294.719 --> 7298.96
it's not literally

7296.56 --> 7300.320000000001
the color

7298.96 --> 7301.36
right

7300.32 --> 7303.44
but

7301.36 --> 7307.598999999999
you can attempt

7303.44 --> 7309.919999999999
to share what its influence is is

7307.599 --> 7311.599
what its influence is on you the

7309.92 --> 7314.08
observer

7311.599 --> 7315.76
what it does to your feelings or to your

7314.08 --> 7319.04
instincts there's all kinds of things

7315.76 --> 7321.360000000001
that can be described about color

7319.04 --> 7322.88
that will end up being relatively

7321.36 --> 7327.5199999999995
universal

7322.88 --> 7327.52
so yeah you can absolutely do that

7329.52 --> 7336.400000000001
right you can even describe a color to a

7332.88 --> 7339.4400000000005
blind person that has never seen

7336.4 --> 7341.839999999999
guess what even though they haven't

7339.44 --> 7346.08
actually seen it

7341.84 --> 7348.639
they will have a distinguishing

7346.08 --> 7351.04
factor about it in their mind do you

7348.639 --> 7353.52
understand people that have no eyesight

7351.04 --> 7356.08
ever that have never seen a single piece

7353.52 --> 7357.84
of light in their entire life ever that

7356.08 --> 7359.44
have literally no eye that were born

7357.84 --> 7361.76
without eyes

7359.44 --> 7363.28
yeah they will have

7361.76 --> 7366.400000000001
a brain

7363.28 --> 7368.5599999999995
and in that brain or memory arguably not

7366.4 --> 7369.839999999999
the brain but the spirit they will have

7368.56 --> 7372.88
storage

7369.84 --> 7377.119000000001
reflector memories of other people

7372.88 --> 7377.119
describing sights and colors

7380.0 --> 7385.84
did you know that without ever having

7382.08 --> 7389.76
seen anything a a blind person can

7385.84 --> 7392.159000000001
eventually virtually recreate a complete

7389.76 --> 7396.0
visual simulation of the physical

7392.159 --> 7398.48
reality around them through their ears

7396.0 --> 7400.8
and touch senses and other things

7398.48 --> 7403.199
perhaps that i maybe magnetic senses

7400.8 --> 7405.04
might awaken or whatever

7403.199 --> 7407.44
they build that

7405.04 --> 7410.0
they have reflections

7407.44 --> 7412.719
right even colorblind people have a

7410.0 --> 7414.8
conception of what the color that they

7412.719 --> 7415.92
can't see is like

7414.8 --> 7419.119000000001
through

7415.92 --> 7422.4400000000005
other people that describe it

7419.119 --> 7422.44
they can

7422.639 --> 7427.28
yeah

7424.4 --> 7430.32
it's not just the sensory equipment it's

7427.28 --> 7434.0
not just your eyes not just your nose no

7430.32 --> 7439.5199999999995
it's the brain in between the translator

7434.0 --> 7441.679
system the storage reflector system

7439.52 --> 7444.4800000000005
that has capacity

7441.679 --> 7446.88
even if the sensory equipment itself is

7444.48 --> 7448.48
faulty there is

7446.88 --> 7451.36
reflector

7448.48 --> 7455.678999999999
capacity in order for you to understand

7451.36 --> 7458.4
it even if you cannot sense it you see

7455.679 --> 7458.4
it works

7461.84 --> 7466.079
you see music is color something that's

7463.679 --> 7469.1990000000005
interesting

7466.079 --> 7471.759999999999
that's very interesting i

7469.199 --> 7473.5199999999995
i have a vague similar sensation like

7471.76 --> 7474.96
that too getting sick

7473.52 --> 7477.84
but for me

7474.96 --> 7480.4
music triggers a lot more emotion so i

7477.84 --> 7482.32
don't have a lot of visual triggers for

7480.4 --> 7483.598999999999
music i have a lot of

7482.32 --> 7487.04
like

7483.599 --> 7488.8
deep-rooted emotional experiences

7487.04 --> 7491.199
that typically tend to get triggered

7488.8 --> 7493.1990000000005
through music so with me

7491.199 --> 7494.0
music tends to resonate a lot more with

7493.199 --> 7495.919999999999
my

7494.0 --> 7499.36
feelings and emotions and social

7495.92 --> 7502.4800000000005
interaction based senses and feelings

7499.36 --> 7504.4
so it can be different for every person

7502.48 --> 7506.718999999999
right one person might have very

7504.4 --> 7508.96
specific type of associations another

7506.719 --> 7511.679
person with different another type of

7508.96 --> 7511.679
association

7518.48 --> 7522.5599999999995
he knows the world doesn't bubble and

7520.079 --> 7522.5599999999995
rotate

7524.8 --> 7528.320000000001
yeah

7525.76 --> 7529.599
did you know that stevie wonder probably

7528.32 --> 7531.5199999999995
isn't blind

7529.599 --> 7534.88
though

7531.52 --> 7535.2300000000005
stevie wonder might be the

7534.88 --> 7537.36
like

7535.23 --> 7540.159
[Music]

7537.36 --> 7542.239
i don't know for sure though

7540.159 --> 7544.32
don't know for sure 100 but there's a

7542.239 --> 7546.5599999999995
lot of suspicion out there conspiracy

7544.32 --> 7548.48
suspicion that stevie wonder might not

7546.56 --> 7552.96
actually be blind and he might be kind

7548.48 --> 7552.959999999999
of like the black helen keller of music

7555.36 --> 7558.799999999999
right

7556.32 --> 7561.599
but who knows

7558.8 --> 7565.28
he could also not be faking it and just

7561.599 --> 7567.4400000000005
having developed incredible

7565.28 --> 7569.759999999999
tactile senses as i said he might have

7567.44 --> 7571.839999999999
had he might have like sonar capacity

7569.76 --> 7574.2390000000005
now where he literally doesn't see but

7571.84 --> 7576.159000000001
he can just feel where things are

7574.239 --> 7578.4
because some blind people can develop

7576.159 --> 7580.879999999999
that especially if they're

7578.4 --> 7584.719
inherently smart

7580.88 --> 7584.719
they're intelligent born people

7587.599 --> 7591.92
or people with a very strong intuition

7591.04 --> 7593.599
both

7591.92 --> 7595.84
can develop

7593.599 --> 7595.84
that

7596.8 --> 7600.56
but that black man from star trek is

7602.96 --> 7605.84
no

7608.719 --> 7612.639
he's been caught what really rigback

7611.36 --> 7614.88
i don't know about that i don't know if

7612.639 --> 7616.4800000000005
he's been caught on it i just know that

7614.88 --> 7619.36
there's a lot of people that suspect

7616.48 --> 7622.32
that he isn't actually blind

7619.36 --> 7625.119
i don't know though i've never met him

7622.32 --> 7627.599
i've but i've seen footage and i

7625.119 --> 7629.759999999999
can attest like yeah it does seem like

7627.599 --> 7632.400000000001
he could be faking it

7629.76 --> 7635.4400000000005
i can't tell though like

7632.4 --> 7635.44
can't really tell

7635.599 --> 7640.159000000001
i would have to meet him

7637.36 --> 7642.159
in person and then be allowed to perform

7640.159 --> 7644.159
very specific types of tests that i will

7642.159 --> 7647.839999999999
do purely intuitive without anything

7644.159 --> 7647.839999999999
written on paper or planned

7648.88 --> 7654.57
so i can test his spirit basically

7652.719 --> 7657.78
but yeah

7654.57 --> 7657.78
[Music]

7671.84 --> 7676.159000000001
jordy i know jordy is from star trek

7673.84 --> 7678.719
next generation yeah sure i love that

7676.159 --> 7681.598999999999
character it's great

7678.719 --> 7681.599
jordy was awesome

7686.639 --> 7690.88
then he caught his mic from falling once

7691.44 --> 7696.079
but why wouldn't you be able to do that

7693.28 --> 7696.079
if you're blind

7696.8 --> 7700.84
though

7698.0 --> 7703.28
to be fair

7700.84 --> 7706.2390000000005
seriously i mean

7703.28 --> 7709.04
when i'm busy doing stuff in the kitchen

7706.239 --> 7712.32
i sometimes drop [ __ ] you think i have

7709.04 --> 7714.88
time to look at it no

7712.32 --> 7716.48
i calculate in my mind it's pathway and

7714.88 --> 7718.8
then i catch it

7716.48 --> 7721.5199999999995
i don't look i just

7718.8 --> 7724.719
literally don't look i don't have to

7721.52 --> 7726.4800000000005
is it falling oh no grab work no it's

7724.719 --> 7729.28
like it's funny

7726.48 --> 7731.5199999999995
i get it i just get it i don't look you

7729.28 --> 7733.679
don't have to see to be able to catch

7731.52 --> 7736.0
anything in a reflex you just have to

7733.679 --> 7736.96
catch it you just have to know where it

7736.0 --> 7739.84
is

7736.96 --> 7742.0
right and that is by the way

7739.84 --> 7745.599
it's kind of the same system that blind

7742.0 --> 7748.079
people also use right

7745.599 --> 7750.119000000001
it's like a sonar effect you just know

7748.079 --> 7752.799999999999
you have

7750.119 --> 7755.28
three-dimensional awareness around your

7752.8 --> 7757.119000000001
body a certain field where you just know

7755.28 --> 7759.759999999999
always where everything is even if you

7757.119 --> 7762.239
don't look you just know hand eye

7759.76 --> 7763.599
coordination very important

7762.239 --> 7765.36
right

7763.599 --> 7767.92
you can have that even if you're blind

7765.36 --> 7770.159
so if he caught a mic once that doesn't

7767.92 --> 7774.84
automatically prove that he isn't blind

7770.159 --> 7774.839999999999
it just means he still has good reflexes

7786.96 --> 7790.639
what are you talking about getting sick

7792.88 --> 7797.679
he wasn't holding it first

7795.84 --> 7801.8
oh

7797.679 --> 7801.8
okay that is weird then

7805.84 --> 7810.400000000001
that that does change things yeah if

7808.159 --> 7811.839999999999
he's not it is very tough to recatch

7810.4 --> 7812.879999999999
something that you're not holding or

7811.84 --> 7814.88
you're not

7812.88 --> 7817.28
like directly physically interacting

7814.88 --> 7819.52
with in the moment that that is very

7817.28 --> 7819.5199999999995
hard

7827.36 --> 7831.44
he said all right to shaq without shaq

7829.599 --> 7834.32
talking to him

7831.44 --> 7834.32
what okay

7836.239 --> 7841.5599999999995
well didn't he know he was gonna be

7838.56 --> 7841.56
there

7843.199 --> 7848.159
it still doesn't prove anything though i

7845.36 --> 7849.44
mean if he's gonna catch a mic that he

7848.159 --> 7851.5199999999995
isn't holding

7849.44 --> 7853.28
that is seriously suspicious because

7851.52 --> 7855.4400000000005
that's something that i wouldn't be able

7853.28 --> 7858.96
to do without actually

7855.44 --> 7860.799999999999
being able to see the thing first

7858.96 --> 7862.2390000000005
if i'm touching it i don't need to see

7860.8 --> 7863.92
it

7862.239 --> 7865.119
i know where it's going to go i know

7863.92 --> 7867.04
what it's going to do i know it's

7865.119 --> 7869.44
pathway in relation to my body i have a

7867.04 --> 7871.44
perfect euclidean coordination with my

7869.44 --> 7872.32
body like that

7871.44 --> 7874.0
right

7872.32 --> 7876.239
but if it's i'm not holding somebody

7874.0 --> 7879.119
else is dropping then i would have to

7876.239 --> 7880.0
look and see to be able to try and catch

7879.119 --> 7882.96
it

7880.0 --> 7884.96
that is suspicious but literally like

7882.96 --> 7886.56
knowing somebody's there even without

7884.96 --> 7890.079
saying anything

7886.56 --> 7890.079000000001
yeah you don't have to

7890.32 --> 7893.84
you don't necessarily have to have eyes

7892.159 --> 7896.719
if he just knew he was gonna be there

7893.84 --> 7898.56
and he just gambled it

7896.719 --> 7900.4800000000005
or he literally might be able to just

7898.56 --> 7902.320000000001
hear him breathing or something i mean

7900.48 --> 7904.879999999999
shaq is a freaking

7902.32 --> 7906.719
gorilla he's giant

7904.88 --> 7908.8
so you would probably be able to hear

7906.719 --> 7910.4
him breathing especially if you are

7908.8 --> 7911.360000000001
actually blind

7910.4 --> 7913.04
so

7911.36 --> 7914.799999999999
there you go

7913.04 --> 7918.679
right

7914.8 --> 7918.679
just being honest here

7936.639 --> 7940.400000000001
or a smell

7938.079 --> 7941.84
i don't know about that but

7940.4 --> 7945.44
yeah i'm not going to say anything about

7941.84 --> 7945.4400000000005
that but perhaps right

7953.44 --> 7957.678999999999
that's right he does dude that guy's

7955.44 --> 7961.04
gonna have like one of the biggest lung

7957.679 --> 7962.96
capacities of any human on earth

7961.04 --> 7965.36
he's that freaking big he probably has

7962.96 --> 7968.84
like at least twice the lungs of the

7965.36 --> 7968.839999999999
average human

7986.8 --> 7991.52
i solved the crime mr watson

7989.36 --> 7993.28
i'm dude i'm just being open-minded

7991.52 --> 7994.639
about it i don't know whether stevie

7993.28 --> 7997.44
wonders is

7994.639 --> 7999.84
really not blind

7997.44 --> 8002.879999999999
although yeah catching something that

7999.84 --> 8004.159000000001
you're not holding for a blind person

8002.88 --> 8006.8
that is

8004.159 --> 8008.96
that is kind of tough like i cannot

8006.8 --> 8010.4800000000005
envision how that could work

8008.96 --> 8012.639
that's really weird

8010.48 --> 8014.48
i've never seen a blind person that's

8012.639 --> 8016.719
really well coordinated do anything like

8014.48 --> 8016.718999999999
that

8018.639 --> 8020.88
right

8020.96 --> 8024.4800000000005
but

8022.239 --> 8026.48
doesn't mean that he that he might

8024.48 --> 8028.0
actually turn out not to be blind i'm

8026.48 --> 8029.759999999999
just saying that all a lot of these

8028.0 --> 8031.36
examples that you guys have mentioned i

8029.76 --> 8034.320000000001
can definitely imagine how that could

8031.36 --> 8036.5599999999995
work for a blind person

8034.32 --> 8038.4
it can it's just a couple of these

8036.56 --> 8041.280000000001
things are like what

8038.4 --> 8045.04
okay that is a bit weird

8041.28 --> 8045.04
like i don't know how that could work

8051.599 --> 8056.96
yeah pgc net yes they can

8054.719 --> 8056.96
yes

8057.52 --> 8061.52
that i was actually gonna bring that up

8062.48 --> 8068.48
but yeah that does work

8065.679 --> 8071.28
you can do it blindfolded wow

8068.48 --> 8073.28
by having perfect coordination what i

8071.28 --> 8075.759999999999
told you right the

8073.28 --> 8077.92
euclidean senses you know ex you don't

8075.76 --> 8078.719
have to see anything to know exactly

8077.92 --> 8083.28
where

8078.719 --> 8083.28
where your body's elements are and how

8083.599 --> 8090.719
and then you can even fight with that

8087.84 --> 8092.719
because you can like interface

8090.719 --> 8096.639
with another person and then you can

8092.719 --> 8096.639
literally feel where their body is

8097.92 --> 8101.119
really

8099.119 --> 8104.5599999999995
you have to train it though otherwise

8101.119 --> 8104.5599999999995
you're just going to get punched a lot

8105.28 --> 8109.8
but yeah that does actually work

8130.079 --> 8134.639
helen keller has a british accent yeah

8132.719 --> 8136.8
yeah well helen keller definitely did

8134.639 --> 8137.84
fake it because none of it made any

8136.8 --> 8139.360000000001
sense

8137.84 --> 8142.159000000001
at all

8139.36 --> 8144.48
right the stevie wonder it's like

8142.159 --> 8145.5199999999995
yeah he might not

8144.48 --> 8146.718999999999
be

8145.52 --> 8149.280000000001
blind

8146.719 --> 8152.96
it could be maybe maybe still i don't

8149.28 --> 8155.36
know but helen keller is just total

8152.96 --> 8157.199
totally nuts that was just

8155.36 --> 8161.199
way over the top

8157.199 --> 8161.199
that makes absolutely no freaking sense

8161.28 --> 8165.5199999999995
like

8162.96 --> 8166.96
how would helen keller have ever been

8165.52 --> 8169.92
able to learn

8166.96 --> 8171.28
talking like that beyond just kid-like

8169.92 --> 8175.119
communication

8171.28 --> 8177.679
like that makes no [ __ ] sense at all

8175.119 --> 8179.5199999999995
and to write a book

8177.679 --> 8182.719
really

8179.52 --> 8185.52
somebody that's born deaf and blind

8182.719 --> 8188.52
is gonna write a book

8185.52 --> 8188.52
okay

8197.359 --> 8201.92
why the lie about helen keller pure hot

8199.599 --> 8201.92
spa

8202.24 --> 8205.679
pure hotspot it's a project it's a

8204.319 --> 8207.679
project

8205.679 --> 8209.359
to make you

8207.679 --> 8212.08
feel really sorry for it this was a

8209.359 --> 8214.16
publicity stunt

8212.08 --> 8215.439
and eugenics that's right they use the

8214.16 --> 8218.0
eugenics

8215.439 --> 8222.479000000001
agenda and all that [ __ ] just like what

8218.0 --> 8222.479
they did with the mr wheelchair puppet

8222.639 --> 8224.96
right

8230.319 --> 8236.08
speaking points

8232.96 --> 8237.919999999998
helen keller was just a speaking point

8236.08 --> 8239.679
yeah hawkins

8237.92 --> 8242.16
yeah you know what i mean when i say

8239.679 --> 8244.0
wheelchair puppet that's usually stephen

8242.16 --> 8245.359
hawkins

8244.0 --> 8247.04
the fake one

8245.359 --> 8249.519
because i do think that the real stephen

8247.04 --> 8251.92
hawking would have never

8249.519 --> 8255.439
ever agreed with any of that garbage he

8251.92 --> 8256.960000000001
was way too proud and smart for that

8255.439 --> 8259.599
[ __ ]

8256.96 --> 8261.839999999998
so i think he just died and then they

8259.599 --> 8263.84
got another look alike with a different

8261.84 --> 8266.719000000001
dental freaking record

8263.84 --> 8269.28
to play his role and just be a

8266.719 --> 8271.839999999998
wheelchair puppet driven around

8269.28 --> 8276.599
with like speakers that can just use his

8271.84 --> 8276.599
mic to say their propaganda [ __ ]

8298.96 --> 8304.559
hey calming ooh

8301.28 --> 8306.719000000001
clutch what are you talking about

8304.559 --> 8307.759999999998
oh helen keller

8306.719 --> 8309.678999999998
yeah

8307.76 --> 8313.12
yeah i think she was well not a

8309.679 --> 8314.16
communist a socialist she was socialist

8313.12 --> 8317.28
and

8314.16 --> 8318.559
which was back then still like a thing

8317.28 --> 8322.0
socialist

8318.559 --> 8323.199999999999
especially socialist healthcare

8322.0 --> 8325.12
and

8323.2 --> 8327.519
eugenicist yeah

8325.12 --> 8329.76
because socialism and eugenicism were

8327.519 --> 8333.0
like really sprouted from the same root

8329.76 --> 8333.0
at the time

8341.92 --> 8348.24
socialist feminist yeah

8344.479 --> 8351.039999999999
socialist feminist eugenicist i mean

8348.24 --> 8351.039999999999
there you go

8358.0 --> 8362.479
it's very unusual yeah

8360.719 --> 8364.719
and not just that

8362.479 --> 8367.039999999999
i mean stephen hawking set the world

8364.719 --> 8369.759999999998
record of all time for being able to

8367.04 --> 8371.519
survive with that condition

8369.76 --> 8374.800000000001
because as you said most don't live past

8371.519 --> 8378.08
their 20s yeah but how many actually

8374.8 --> 8379.518999999998
live past their 50s

8378.08 --> 8382.16
okay

8379.519 --> 8386.92
that's absurd

8382.16 --> 8386.92
like no just no

8391.28 --> 8394.479000000001
like how would they how the hell would

8393.12 --> 8397.12
they have halted

8394.479 --> 8398.8
the muscle muscular degeneration

8397.12 --> 8401.12
they're not able to that's the whole

8398.8 --> 8403.679999999998
freaking point so how the hell could he

8401.12 --> 8406.08
have lived that long

8403.68 --> 8409.08
he couldn't it's impossible it's

8406.08 --> 8409.08
ridiculous

8418.02 --> 8421.19
[Music]

8424.0 --> 8428.84
strong support of eugenics socialism and

8426.16 --> 8432.479
women's right

8428.84 --> 8433.2
yeah that's probably part of it

8432.479 --> 8435.279999999999
but

8433.2 --> 8437.6
yeah also you know like how would she

8435.28 --> 8440.24
have even known

8437.6 --> 8442.960000000001
if she was translated correctly i mean

8440.24 --> 8442.96
she's deaf

8443.04 --> 8447.28
so they could have literally just like

8444.96 --> 8450.72
she might have not even known that they

8447.28 --> 8450.720000000001
were just bullshitting with her

8450.88 --> 8454.72
she might be convinced like oh no we're

8452.96 --> 8456.24
helping you and that she really thought

8454.72 --> 8458.0
she was writing a book and that they

8456.24 --> 8460.16
just ignored what she wrote because it

8458.0 --> 8462.479
was kind of crappy

8460.16 --> 8464.88
and then they just wrote stupid thing

8462.479 --> 8467.84
propaganda piece for her and then like

8464.88 --> 8469.759999999998
how she's she's not gonna read that

8467.84 --> 8471.52
how is she gonna do that oh what do you

8469.76 --> 8474.56
think they're gonna

8471.52 --> 8475.76
print the propaganda piece of her book

8474.56 --> 8477.68
in bray

8475.76 --> 8480.16
so she can read that

8477.68 --> 8481.439
no of course they're gonna just give her

8480.16 --> 8483.6
back her own

8481.439 --> 8485.04
stupid little writing that she thought

8483.6 --> 8487.12
she read

8485.04 --> 8489.359
just for her

8487.12 --> 8490.880000000001
and then out there the propaganda piece

8489.359 --> 8493.12
without bry

8490.88 --> 8496.72
and she would never have known because

8493.12 --> 8498.640000000001
she's deaf if people tell her she won't

8496.72 --> 8501.64
find out

8498.64 --> 8501.64
ridiculous

8501.76 --> 8507.68
right so either it was all complete hoax

8504.399 --> 8510.399
or they just so screwed her

8507.68 --> 8512.960000000001
like the people promoting her were then

8510.399 --> 8514.8
absolutely abusing her and screwing her

8512.96 --> 8518.16
and turning her into a political pawn

8514.8 --> 8519.519999999999
and she would have never even known

8518.16 --> 8524.6
she would have never even known what the

8519.52 --> 8524.6
hell she was being being caught up in

8527.88 --> 8531.019999999999
[Music]

8547.439 --> 8550.399
huh

8548.399 --> 8553.399
okay getting sick i didn't know that

8550.399 --> 8553.399
interesting

8575.439 --> 8579.6
chip sid aka stephen hawkins

8580.24 --> 8585.0
it's just

8582.0 --> 8585.0
yeah

8597.28 --> 8601.359
yeah for me i just always thought that

8599.439 --> 8603.439
that guy wasn't even in on it that they

8601.359 --> 8605.92
were literally just using him because he

8603.439 --> 8608.24
can't do anything

8605.92 --> 8611.6
i mean all he the guy could do is just

8608.24 --> 8612.96
stop breathing or something

8611.6 --> 8615.84
so i always felt that that stephen

8612.96 --> 8618.72
hawkins was just literally being abused

8615.84 --> 8620.399
like abused abused i don't even want to

8618.72 --> 8622.24
know how far that went but that he was

8620.399 --> 8623.76
just like being rolled around and he

8622.24 --> 8626.319
didn't probably he might have not even

8623.76 --> 8627.84
wanted to do anything of it it's just

8626.319 --> 8630.479
like no you're just gonna do it because

8627.84 --> 8632.72
what are you gonna do walk away

8630.479 --> 8632.72
right

8637.84 --> 8641.2
yeah

8639.12 --> 8643.68
but he stephen hawkins like the la the

8641.2 --> 8646.800000000001
letter it just seemed like an abused

8643.68 --> 8650.319
handicapped person that was just

8646.8 --> 8651.279999999999
being portrayed like this genius

8650.319 --> 8653.68
when

8651.28 --> 8655.359
like you can't see that in his eyes you

8653.68 --> 8656.960000000001
can't where's the brilliant in his eyes

8655.359 --> 8659.52
there's no brilliance in his eyes he

8656.96 --> 8662.16
just seems depressed a lot of the time

8659.52 --> 8664.720000000001
like not somebody that's really inspired

8662.16 --> 8667.359
you know when i start talking about an

8664.72 --> 8669.599999999999
idea that i have i i get like all

8667.359 --> 8671.04
inspired in my eyes right i get all

8669.6 --> 8674.319
fired up

8671.04 --> 8677.12
he didn't have any of that

8674.319 --> 8679.68
like he was bored well he's supposed to

8677.12 --> 8683.12
be reading out like this revolutionary

8679.68 --> 8686.68
idea he looks bored

8683.12 --> 8686.68
that's ridiculous

8696.59 --> 8700.399
[Music]

8701.76 --> 8704.76

8773.84 --> 8777.08
