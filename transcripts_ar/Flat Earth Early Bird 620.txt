donation

94.159 --> 98.88000000000001
look at this it's just

98.96 --> 103.52
unbelievable yeah there's a plane flying

101.84 --> 106.07900000000001
over there

103.52 --> 108.24
but it's too small for this webcam it's

106.079 --> 111.36
just

108.24 --> 114.56
not a single

111.36 --> 117.52
trace of any form of cloud

114.56 --> 118.32000000000001
whatsoever i've seen this kind of

117.52 --> 122.0
weather in a

118.32 --> 123.19999999999999
long time that rarely happens in the

122.0 --> 126.24
netherlands

123.2 --> 129.44
it's unbelievably blue

126.24 --> 131.51999999999998
see like you can see

129.44 --> 132.48
the air pressure and everything is

131.52 --> 136.72
higher

132.48 --> 140.23899999999998
at the horizon because it's slightly

136.72 --> 143.52
less deep blue but yeah you can even see

140.239 --> 146.72
the color gradient is perfectly stable

143.52 --> 149.92000000000002
it means that there is just no

146.72 --> 151.35999999999999
water irregularities even dissolved in

149.92 --> 153.92
the very air

151.36 --> 155.12
and yeah i agree because it seems pretty

153.92 --> 158.64
dry

155.12 --> 161.92000000000002
this is like pretty dry weather and warm

158.64 --> 161.92
it's totally different

164.879 --> 170.239
really warm but yeah in the shadows is

168.08 --> 172.08
actually really pleasant so this is just

170.239 --> 176.4
like

172.08 --> 179.28
typical weather that we had in

176.4 --> 180.72
spain when i went to vacation with my

179.28 --> 183.76
family there in the

180.72 --> 185.28
in the 90s and all that would be a lot

183.76 --> 188.72
of this weather

185.28 --> 190.8
very beautiful very hot

188.72 --> 193.28
but yeah not so moist so i can still

190.8 --> 196.959
wear a shirt

193.28 --> 200.319
right so i got grapefruit juice with me

196.959 --> 202.239
in green tea although it is it does look

200.319 --> 212.48
kind of hot

202.239 --> 213.36
we'll see this is good let's see who's

212.48 --> 216.48
in chat

213.36 --> 218.56
it's kind of filled up yeah sorry i'm a

216.48 --> 222.23899999999998
bit late

218.56 --> 225.28
again but yeah that's uh

222.239 --> 228.879
several reasons mostly because

225.28 --> 231.68
rodrigo ferrari nunes was doing one of

228.879 --> 235.439
his bike premieres

231.68 --> 237.519
and yeah that was good but

235.439 --> 240.239
uh yeah it kept it was still playing

237.519 --> 240.72
when at 2 p.m amsterdam time so i kind

240.239 --> 243.84
of

240.72 --> 245.92
had to kind of yeah

243.84 --> 247.519
break that off but it was good you know

245.92 --> 248.23899999999998
i really like those streams when he does

247.519 --> 251.84
it

248.239 --> 255.28
robin stanley was in there too anyway

251.84 --> 258.799
uh agm was first today

255.28 --> 260.32
here we go again kim robinson amanda

258.799 --> 264.96
young

260.32 --> 264.96
good servant tom parker

266.479 --> 269.84
over mccool

274.72 --> 278.08000000000004
matthew mitchell

278.639 --> 286.32
robin stanley yeah john bernards

283.12 --> 288.4
right gladshaw ha yeah good to see you

286.32 --> 291.84
all

288.4 --> 295.03999999999996
so pj p

291.84 --> 297.919
files okay hello

295.04 --> 297.91900000000004
stazmaretz

298.24 --> 303.919
right let me make some notes

304.96 --> 313.28
for today

310.56 --> 315.36
dude like this is starting to just look

313.28 --> 317.59999999999997
like an agenda maybe i should just have

315.36 --> 320.40000000000003
a freaking agenda again

317.6 --> 321.84000000000003
because that's basically what i'm doing

320.4 --> 324.88
it's even sort of like

321.84 --> 327.75899999999996
agenda segment sized

324.88 --> 329.919
so maybe i should just get an agenda

327.759 --> 333.039
this is starting to be weird to me

329.919 --> 334.96
but yeah it already yielded advantages

333.039 --> 336.08
in the sense that i can actually look up

334.96 --> 339.68
things that i've done

336.08 --> 341.59999999999997
it's and yeah organizing hmm

339.68 --> 343.68
never really had the need for it now i

341.6 --> 345.12
have a show and suddenly yeah organizing

343.68 --> 348.56
oh dear and youtube

345.12 --> 348.56
crashes on me again

349.36 --> 355.68
seriously guys i'll i'll just

353.12 --> 358.08
show it to you because obs is still

355.68 --> 358.08
going

358.16 --> 363.28000000000003
but yeah this just happened

363.52 --> 366.96
like what and it happened with the chat

366.16 --> 369.03900000000004
too

366.96 --> 371.52
it's been happening more often very

369.039 --> 371.52
annoying

371.68 --> 374.0
uh

377.36 --> 383.6
don't know why that happened

380.479 --> 384.31899999999996
anybody else experiencing that or is it

383.6 --> 387.91900000000004
just me

384.319 --> 390.72
i am running it through firefox maybe

387.919 --> 392.31899999999996
i did do an update not too long ago i

390.72 --> 395.52000000000004
think that this version actually

392.319 --> 398.72
destabilized it

395.52 --> 402.15999999999997
anyway uh yeah also i

398.72 --> 405.03900000000004
i was just browsing around this morning

402.16 --> 406.40000000000003
and i found this video i posted it in

405.039 --> 409.199
the uh

406.4 --> 411.52
in the early bird chat over at skype for

409.199 --> 413.84000000000003
those that are in there

411.52 --> 415.44
it's called the druids and it's like a

413.84 --> 417.19899999999996
history piece

415.44 --> 418.8
from i don't know some channel i've

417.199 --> 421.12
never heard before the histocrat he was

418.8 --> 424.479
on the main page so

421.12 --> 427.52
but it looks

424.479 --> 430.08
interesting because it is like really

427.52 --> 432.15999999999997
historical angle and then i only got

430.08 --> 433.68
into 10 minutes of it and then got

432.16 --> 435.03900000000004
distracted and all that

433.68 --> 436.40000000000003
but i'm definitely gonna continue

435.039 --> 439.599
watching it because even those 10

436.4 --> 441.919
minutes were very interesting to me

439.599 --> 443.28
so i don't know maybe i'll put that it's

441.919 --> 446.56
a history piece it's

443.28 --> 450.4
two hours so yeah

446.56 --> 452.8
it it it's big

450.4 --> 455.67999999999995
but for those that want to know like the

452.8 --> 458.319
historical druids

455.68 --> 459.919
i think this is great and for me it's

458.319 --> 463.44
fascinating too because i

459.919 --> 466.56
have like i don't know ethereal

463.44 --> 470.56
inspiration from the concept of druids

466.56 --> 473.36
and yeah there's of course

470.56 --> 473.919
yeah presumed dark history as well in

473.36 --> 477.12
certain

473.919 --> 479.19899999999996
ways but the funny thing is is that

477.12 --> 480.4
this piece so far even in a 10 minute

479.199 --> 483.759
like puts that

480.4 --> 486.479
into political context situations as

483.759 --> 490.47900000000004
well like what was happening how

486.479 --> 493.039
why it's good never seen it before

490.479 --> 494.87899999999996
an actual suggestion from youtube main

493.039 --> 498.24
page that was good

494.879 --> 500.879
so yeah thanks youtube maybe youtube got

498.24 --> 504.479
my message from yesterday

500.879 --> 509.68
because yesterday uh the video

504.479 --> 509.68
yeah did you see the the votes

510.08 --> 516.959
it's sadly suddenly

515.039 --> 518.8
or maybe they down screwed it all of a

516.959 --> 522.64
sudden i don't know let's see

518.8 --> 526.24
no yeah oh yeah they did oh my god they

522.64 --> 530.24
did they down screwed it again

526.24 --> 531.2
those sons of [ __ ] yeah it had 18 up

530.24 --> 534.9590000000001
votes

531.2 --> 538.0
and like and now it it's back to

534.959 --> 538.56
10 up votes what but that's still like

538.0 --> 542.399
almost

538.56 --> 545.5189999999999
record for how it's been for like

542.399 --> 548.959
months usually doesn't get above the

545.519 --> 551.68
two or three this is yeah

548.959 --> 555.5999999999999
that was just weird to see afterward

551.68 --> 555.5999999999999
because i got pretty pissed at youtube

556.72 --> 560.8000000000001
and i know that there's gravelers in

559.279 --> 563.04
there so if i make it

560.8 --> 564.64
hey this is remember same time as last

563.04 --> 566.399
time i complain about my thousand

564.64 --> 568.08
subscribers

566.399 --> 570.24
when then i'm outraged about something

568.08 --> 571.9200000000001
then they change it and it makes me look

570.24 --> 572.399
like a fool it's such an easy little

571.92 --> 574.24
trick

572.399 --> 576.0
nobody can even point at any parties

574.24 --> 578.0
just them looking and then switching in

576.0 --> 579.839
the right moment it's so easy so funny

578.0 --> 582.56
hahaha so much power

579.839 --> 584.399
right so maybe that was it maybe they

582.56 --> 588.0
just saw oh i'm

584.399 --> 588.72
being so pessimistic about youtube so

588.0 --> 591.76
they just

588.72 --> 593.0
had to turn it to normal just just for

591.76 --> 596.56
the

593.0 --> 601.68
dissociating effect because they are

596.56 --> 601.68
bastards anyway

602.56 --> 607.3399999999999
yeah right yeah lots has happened

606.32 --> 608.72
yesterday

607.34 --> 610.9590000000001
[Music]

608.72 --> 610.9590000000001
uh

612.399 --> 618.0
right yeah the the beirut explosion

615.839 --> 619.12
[ __ ] yeah that definitely got my

618.0 --> 621.2
attention

619.12 --> 622.88
yeah it basically came in when i was

621.2 --> 625.519
watching alex jones

622.88 --> 626.88
it like came in fresh so he was like oh

625.519 --> 629.36
this just came in like

626.88 --> 631.92
live right now so he was like got there

629.36 --> 634.72
i got there in the first minute

631.92 --> 635.4399999999999
whatever that means but yeah that was

634.72 --> 638.88
pretty

635.44 --> 639.7600000000001
astounding and there was a quite a lot

638.88 --> 641.8389999999999
of footage

639.76 --> 644.72
like a page that came out on a dutch

641.839 --> 644.72
alternative news

647.519 --> 653.839
distribution point they

650.959 --> 657.4399999999999
had like all video like all kinds of

653.839 --> 659.0400000000001
even a waterside video of it

657.44 --> 660.5600000000001
so there was lots of video of it

659.04 --> 662.16
happening because the thing was already

660.56 --> 665.04
on fire for some time

662.16 --> 666.64
yeah and then everybody gets the like oh

665.04 --> 668.3199999999999
everybody starts pointing their camera

666.64 --> 669.92
at it so it's completely logical if it

668.32 --> 670.88
just exploded out of nowhere then

669.92 --> 672.399
probably no

670.88 --> 674.24
almost no footage would have been caught

672.399 --> 676.72
of it but

674.24 --> 678.9590000000001
man that was one hell of a detonation

676.72 --> 678.9590000000001
there

679.92 --> 687.5999999999999
so yeah that's the talk of the day

683.76 --> 689.4399999999999
it's lots of video lots of responses

687.6 --> 692.5600000000001
and yeah what is it and of course

689.44 --> 697.2
politic trump immediately was there to

692.56 --> 700.4799999999999
get all like ooh terrorist attack

697.2 --> 702.6400000000001
but yeah i don't know

700.48 --> 703.839
if there was something weird there at

702.64 --> 707.8389999999999
least like

703.839 --> 710.8000000000001
that such a detonation to that

707.839 --> 712.48
that poundage that that amount could

710.8 --> 715.76
happen means that there was just

712.48 --> 716.0
a certain amount of substance stockpiled

715.76 --> 719.2
in

716.0 --> 720.24
whatever form whether it was one giant

719.2 --> 723.0400000000001
clump or just a

720.24 --> 725.36
bunch of cans or blocks or yeah if

723.04 --> 726.7199999999999
enough of that is in close proximity and

725.36 --> 728.639
then it triggers it's

726.72 --> 730.72
yeah that's exactly what happened so

728.639 --> 733.519
it's weird

730.72 --> 736.24
that that was there it seems like either

733.519 --> 739.68
there was something reckless going on

736.24 --> 743.6800000000001
or something illegal because

739.68 --> 747.519
that's like that's not a remote

743.68 --> 750.3199999999999
area for yeah for super dangerous things

747.519 --> 750.32
like that so

752.639 --> 759.839
no debris

763.04 --> 767.36
yeah yeah the explosion was spherical

766.079 --> 771.4399999999999
you know why because

767.36 --> 774.8000000000001
gas pressure expands in all directions

771.44 --> 777.36
there was no oh wait maybe it's going

774.8 --> 779.3599999999999
more to the side and yeah go down no no

777.36 --> 781.6800000000001
it's all directions anyway uh that

779.36 --> 783.92
happened

781.68 --> 783.92
uh

784.959 --> 788.959
yeah i i i also yeah i was late over at

788.24 --> 793.839
big bears

788.959 --> 793.8389999999999
because of that as well great face

797.04 --> 800.16
and then ball busters but yeah i

798.959 --> 803.3599999999999
literally missed the

800.16 --> 804.959
entire ball busters because robin

803.36 --> 808.639
stanley skype called me

804.959 --> 810.399
and it was yeah like we

808.639 --> 811.839
we just had to talk for at least two

810.399 --> 814.48
hours

811.839 --> 815.7600000000001
so i completely missed the ball busters

814.48 --> 818.639
i don't even know what it was

815.76 --> 819.279
about but i i got in the discord panel

818.639 --> 822.5600000000001
and then just

819.279 --> 824.639
muted when robin called me and then

822.56 --> 827.199
when i looked everybody was out of the

824.639 --> 830.9590000000001
panel so

827.199 --> 832.88
uh so i completely missed that

830.959 --> 835.04
and after that i just rewatched my own

832.88 --> 843.8389999999999
show and yeah

835.04 --> 843.8389999999999
it was good

849.279 --> 853.199
okay that that's a really dumb thing to

852.16 --> 856.7199999999999
say pjp

853.199 --> 859.12
files really dumb

856.72 --> 860.399
i think you're a troll i'm gonna put you

859.12 --> 862.32
on a timeout to

860.399 --> 863.44
think about what you just said because

862.32 --> 867.6
i'm at the

863.44 --> 870.0
the top of a flat apartment building

867.6 --> 872.8000000000001
it's technically impossible for any kind

870.0 --> 875.68
of car to crash in my home

872.8 --> 876.3199999999999
literally impossible not even a night

875.68 --> 880.7199999999999
rider

876.32 --> 882.639
jump could achieve that okay

880.72 --> 885.1990000000001
not even a turbo boost jump could do

882.639 --> 888.639
that it's too high

885.199 --> 891.04
and yeah you

888.639 --> 892.24
if that had happened i think i'd share

891.04 --> 893.5999999999999
something like that with

892.24 --> 895.6800000000001
people so i don't know what you're

893.6 --> 897.9200000000001
talking about

895.68 --> 899.199
elon flying car well it's not time for

897.92 --> 901.76
that yet

899.199 --> 901.76
if ever

905.6 --> 913.839
right i think i got through all my notes

914.16 --> 919.279
right so anyway yeah i've been looking

916.8 --> 922.0
around and there's just this

919.279 --> 924.24
enormous amounts of speculation to

922.0 --> 924.8
people as to what exactly was happening

924.24 --> 927.519
there

924.8 --> 931.68
somebody mentioned that maybe they had a

927.519 --> 934.8
big stockpile of artificial fertilizer

931.68 --> 937.7589999999999
i i thought that was actually

934.8 --> 940.0
halfway logical because yeah that is an

937.759 --> 943.279
industrial good

940.0 --> 945.759
it shouldn't be used but

943.279 --> 946.399
it is meant for agriculture and they

945.759 --> 949.6800000000001
could have

946.399 --> 951.6
yeah been reckless it's basically comes

949.68 --> 953.5999999999999
it's a continuation of my first

951.6 --> 955.839
idea about it that it was reckless that

953.6 --> 956.24
they really stockpiled a huge amount of

955.839 --> 958.72
it

956.24 --> 959.839
for distribution it just happened to get

958.72 --> 963.519
there

959.839 --> 963.519
altogether and then this happened

963.68 --> 971.92
but that's like a yeah how does

968.48 --> 971.9200000000001
something like this happen you know

977.519 --> 982.0
and of course seriously people were also

980.079 --> 984.88
saying oh it's a nuke it's a nuke

982.0 --> 987.519
just like in fukushima it's a nuke it's

984.88 --> 987.519
like dude

992.8 --> 997.04
ah yeah yeah i of course responded like

996.56 --> 999.5189999999999
oh

997.04 --> 1001.759
yeah nukes don't exist and got all the

999.519 --> 1011.839
down votes of course

1001.759 --> 1011.839
it's brilliant

1013.36 --> 1019.6
it was just a really freaking big

1016.16 --> 1019.6
detonation shockwave

1019.68 --> 1024.8799999999999
and yeah it shattered and vaporized like

1023.04 --> 1027.12
the entire building there it's

1024.88 --> 1028.959
insane i've never seen that before on

1027.12 --> 1032.8799999999999
camera for real

1028.959 --> 1032.88
it's like yeah

1035.36 --> 1040.4799999999998
like i wonder what the effective

1038.0 --> 1042.48
explosive poundage of this was because

1040.48 --> 1044.959
i don't know this is almost like a

1042.48 --> 1045.76
mother of all bomb sized explosion or

1044.959 --> 1047.52
something

1045.76 --> 1049.6
because it was really a singular

1047.52 --> 1052.72
detonation like that

1049.6 --> 1066.48
you know that's that's like

1052.72 --> 1069.039
big anyway

1066.48 --> 1071.1200000000001
right yeah you know what i don't know if

1069.039 --> 1073.12
youtube's gonna get all

1071.12 --> 1075.12
pissy about it but i think i'll show one

1073.12 --> 1078.6399999999999
of the videos

1075.12 --> 1081.039
the water side i don't know because yeah

1078.64 --> 1083.2800000000002
that one i caught that one only very

1081.039 --> 1086.48
recently

1083.28 --> 1088.48
oh dear is that gonna work yeah that's a

1086.48 --> 1095.84
stupid little screen that's not gonna

1088.48 --> 1095.84
help anything

1095.919 --> 1098.96
let's see hold on

1100.96 --> 1105.28
all right yeah i can full screen it oh

1103.52 --> 1109.36
[ __ ] then i have to literally full

1105.28 --> 1111.84
screen and that's not what i wanted

1109.36 --> 1111.84
damn it

1113.039 --> 1123.84
these video formats are so clumsy

1125.44 --> 1127.76
man

1128.88 --> 1133.0390000000002
oh wait this is another water shot i

1131.28 --> 1134.16
haven't even seen that one it's even

1133.039 --> 1136.96
closer

1134.16 --> 1138.88
damn they lit you literally see the

1136.96 --> 1141.919
ripple of the shockwave

1138.88 --> 1151.8400000000001
going through the water approaching them

1141.919 --> 1151.8400000000001
down it's crazy

1161.2 --> 1166.72
michael rook and moab uses two

1162.799 --> 1168.799
explosions well this kind of did as well

1166.72 --> 1170.0
because you saw it first there is like a

1168.799 --> 1173.12
more fiery

1170.0 --> 1178.24
explosion and then like the the full

1173.12 --> 1180.6399999999999
the big detonation happened

1178.24 --> 1180.64
anyway

1181.76 --> 1184.32
let's see

1188.24 --> 1193.84
i hate just stupid

1204.84 --> 1207.84
now

1217.679 --> 1224.4
it's just brilliant

1221.28 --> 1226.96
now i'm not gonna show it

1224.4 --> 1228.72
it's one of those stupid little twitter

1226.96 --> 1231.52
videos and you can't

1228.72 --> 1233.3600000000001
yeah i'm not gonna show you a video

1231.52 --> 1234.0
that's even smaller than the flat earth

1233.36 --> 1237.12
early bird

1234.0 --> 1239.039
icon in the corner it's ridiculous

1237.12 --> 1249.84
anyway you'll find it if you're really

1239.039 --> 1249.84
interested in any of that

1257.6 --> 1263.84
right so anyway what are you talking

1260.84 --> 1263.84
about

1278.559 --> 1282.8799999999999
detonation on moab look totally

1280.48 --> 1282.88
different

1288.84 --> 1291.84
really

1294.72 --> 1305.84
okay if you say so agm

1308.96 --> 1321.919
okay this is getting incoherent

1318.64 --> 1326.0800000000002
a chemical plant exploded in china

1321.919 --> 1326.0800000000002
really i didn't know that

1328.24 --> 1332.64
that explosion was 250 tons of

1330.88 --> 1335.7600000000002
improperly stored nitrate

1332.64 --> 1338.7990000000002
which one the one in china or

1335.76 --> 1338.799
the one in beirut

1344.88 --> 1348.7990000000002
yeah improperly stored hey artificial

1347.84 --> 1350.72
fertilizer

1348.799 --> 1353.36
you know that is what it is and yeah

1350.72 --> 1356.24
guess what nitrate

1353.36 --> 1359.1999999999998
tends to be kind of exp also a component

1356.24 --> 1362.4
for detonation type of explosives

1359.2 --> 1365.3600000000001
i know that because i used to be kind of

1362.4 --> 1365.3600000000001
into fireworks

1366.32 --> 1371.2
it's no good artificial fertilizers just

1370.159 --> 1375.8200000000002
don't do it

1371.2 --> 1377.039
it's it's bad news

1375.82 --> 1380.08
[Music]

1377.039 --> 1382.32
either you ruin the land or you blow

1380.08 --> 1389.84
something up

1382.32 --> 1389.84
you know

1400.84 --> 1405.28
hmm

1402.32 --> 1407.6
but did that happen simultaneously or

1405.28 --> 1409.28
did that happen like a few hours later

1407.6 --> 1411.6
because that would make sense that i

1409.28 --> 1414.48
didn't pick up on it

1411.6 --> 1414.48
did i miss that

1415.6 --> 1420.08
i just happen to be watching at yeah

1418.4 --> 1423.279
somebody who's always trying to be

1420.08 --> 1425.6
the first who's always news first thing

1423.279 --> 1428.559
you know alex is really a news firster

1425.6 --> 1428.559
with that kind of thing

1428.72 --> 1432.559
and then yeah it happened to be his time

1430.559 --> 1436.3999999999999
slot i was just watching it and

1432.559 --> 1436.3999999999999
and then it popped up just like that

1436.96 --> 1445.8400000000001
but i don't know about the china thing

1461.2 --> 1467.279
it was obama's birthday yesterday

1464.96 --> 1467.279
what

1470.84 --> 1473.84
really

1484.84 --> 1487.84
huh

1489.36 --> 1492.9599999999998
jesus 200

1493.48 --> 1500.32
2700 tons

1496.88 --> 1506.72
of ammonium nitrate jesus

1500.32 --> 1510.559
that's insane that is absolutely bizarre

1506.72 --> 1513.6000000000001
just just having that amount

1510.559 --> 1516.799
in a single location for any reason

1513.6 --> 1520.0
is just an insane hazard that's

1516.799 --> 1523.039
ex that is absurdly irresponsible

1520.0 --> 1525.36
really especially in in an area where

1523.039 --> 1527.12
there's just a city around like what the

1525.36 --> 1530.559
[ __ ]

1527.12 --> 1530.559
it's completely insane

1531.039 --> 1543.84
are you are you talking about the other

1532.96 --> 1543.8400000000001
thing now please

1554.84 --> 1557.84
right

1558.48 --> 1563.3600000000001
well it is a bit weird that there would

1560.4 --> 1565.1200000000001
be a firework factory not too close away

1563.36 --> 1568.799
from that storage but

1565.12 --> 1572.08
come on to have

1568.799 --> 1574.24
that storage in anything else but some

1572.08 --> 1578.0
bunker in the middle of the desert

1574.24 --> 1584.08
at least 100 miles away from population

1578.0 --> 1586.96
is crazy to me this

1584.08 --> 1587.36
oh maybe 100 miles you know what i mean

1586.96 --> 1591.279
just

1587.36 --> 1591.279
not in the middle of a freaking city

1593.44 --> 1601.76
although it did seem like yeah a few

1597.12 --> 1601.76
steps away from the more denser city

1610.84 --> 1613.84
region

1638.84 --> 1641.84
um

1646.96 --> 1649.279
what

1652.48 --> 1656.96
what obamacare you're saying that it's

1654.64 --> 1656.96
that

1659.36 --> 1669.84
that's a i don't know man this is

1662.24 --> 1669.84
getting kind of all over the place

1686.58 --> 1693.76
[Music]

1689.12 --> 1693.76
agm it's it's not a dome it's a

1694.84 --> 1697.84
shockwave

1709.039 --> 1711.84
right

1714.32 --> 1718.96
color of the smoke well it's just yeah

1721.2 --> 1725.8400000000001
brown and black and just looks dirty

1754.0 --> 1758.88
pressure wave well it's called the shock

1755.84 --> 1758.8799999999999
waves that's right

1765.279 --> 1768.72
now the the pressure wave is another

1767.279 --> 1770.88
thing that is

1768.72 --> 1772.88
what yeah right at the beginning when

1770.88 --> 1776.0800000000002
you see the

1772.88 --> 1777.44
like the explosion rip and implosion

1776.08 --> 1779.52
that's

1777.44 --> 1783.3600000000001
that's like the pressure wave yeah

1779.52 --> 1786.1589999999999
that's that's the most destructive thing

1783.36 --> 1786.799
besides yeah yeah the shock wave which

1786.159 --> 1789.7600000000002
literally

1786.799 --> 1791.679
rips you apart on a molecular scale if

1789.76 --> 1796.0
you're too close

1791.679 --> 1800.24
but that that yeah that white

1796.0 --> 1803.52
ripple that that thing is

1800.24 --> 1805.56
that's a shock wave that's literally the

1803.52 --> 1806.8799999999999
thing that just

1805.56 --> 1810.32
[Music]

1806.88 --> 1810.96
what does it say uh it's not a porsche

1810.32 --> 1813.2
report

1810.96 --> 1815.52
jesus christ those [ __ ] things are

1813.2 --> 1815.52
loud

1818.159 --> 1821.2
annoying [ __ ]

1821.44 --> 1824.96
i can't even hear myself here

1825.76 --> 1834.64
uh but the shock waves

1830.159 --> 1838.7990000000002
are yeah they really

1834.64 --> 1842.48
what is it it's not a pressure it's just

1838.799 --> 1842.48
like a shock it's like a

1842.88 --> 1848.7990000000002
a sound effect like a ripple

1846.88 --> 1850.72
but it's like extremely violent so you

1848.799 --> 1855.2
could say that like there's

1850.72 --> 1858.64
maybe even micro vacuum

1855.2 --> 1858.64
in the shock wave itself

1860.48 --> 1865.1200000000001
because because of just the violence of

1863.36 --> 1869.4399999999998
how much the air

1865.12 --> 1872.7199999999998
locally is being yeah

1869.44 --> 1879.8400000000001
ripped apart and that persists that

1872.72 --> 1879.84
that shocks on sonic boom right

1884.64 --> 1889.279
anyway that that wasn't my best

1886.399 --> 1889.279
description ever

1890.48 --> 1894.799
driving me nuts stupid planes flying

1893.76 --> 1897.919
over

1894.799 --> 1901.9189999999999
like really close and there's damn

1897.919 --> 1904.64
dirt bikes just get out

1901.919 --> 1905.6000000000001
go to the freaking outer country or

1904.64 --> 1907.519
something

1905.6 --> 1910.7199999999998
stop racing around with those damn

1907.519 --> 1910.72
things in the middle of the city

1911.279 --> 1914.32
damn dirt bikes

1918.0 --> 1924.32
oh wow hello

1921.12 --> 1929.36

1932.64 --> 1937.3600000000001
army as they call themselves

1934.08 --> 1937.36
yeah they've been around for

1937.44 --> 1940.72
just as long as the flat earth debates

1939.279 --> 1942.799
have pretty much

1940.72 --> 1945.1200000000001
when they got on there yeah they they

1942.799 --> 1945.12
came

1946.24 --> 1953.679
and i know who they are yeah guess what

1949.76 --> 1953.679
it's a freaking jason mccormack

1955.519 --> 1960.3990000000001
it's either him or he knows the people

1957.679 --> 1960.3990000000001
that do that

1960.96 --> 1963.8400000000001
guaranteed

1981.919 --> 1987.1200000000001
okay uh john marinard magnesium

1988.24 --> 1994.32
right well it's it's flash

1991.36 --> 1996.08
it burns very very bright it's bright

1994.32 --> 1999.76
flash uh

1996.08 --> 2002.48
they use magnesium for

1999.76 --> 2004.08
as far as i remember for photography for

2002.48 --> 2007.3600000000001
mechanical photography

2004.08 --> 2007.36
you know powder

2010.0 --> 2013.919
because it's just a bright light and

2012.0 --> 2015.279
there's also fireworks that have it you

2013.919 --> 2018.3990000000001
got to be careful don't

2015.279 --> 2019.279
stare into magnesium flame it's gonna

2018.399 --> 2021.84
freaking

2019.279 --> 2021.84
blind you

2022.799 --> 2026.6399999999999
it's also very hot by the way

2026.88 --> 2031.519
i i think it's comparable to uh what's

2029.6 --> 2032.08
it called again to thermite except it's

2031.519 --> 2035.1200000000001
not as

2032.08 --> 2038.559
insanely hot but it is very hot it's

2035.12 --> 2038.559
it seems like the same effect

2039.679 --> 2043.679
yeah okay well that's very nice that you

2042.88 --> 2045.919
i think it's

2043.679 --> 2047.519
funny that you oh the wind family

2045.919 --> 2049.04
they're so funny well i don't think

2047.519 --> 2050.8
they're funny i think they're freaking

2049.04 --> 2053.2799999999997
annoying

2050.8 --> 2054.8
and they're a detriment to the

2053.28 --> 2061.8390000000004
seriousness of

2054.8 --> 2061.8390000000004
what i do

2062.96 --> 2066.8
and i'm really annoyed that everybody

2065.04 --> 2069.7599999999998
seems to think it's so freaking

2066.8 --> 2071.44
funny i don't think they're funny now

2069.76 --> 2074.7200000000003
you can think they're funny

2071.44 --> 2076.8
if you want but just don't expect that

2074.72 --> 2077.1189999999997
i'm gonna think it's funny anytime soon

2076.8 --> 2079.28
that's

2077.119 --> 2079.28
all

2080.32 --> 2084.32
you know if you think oh yeah it is kind

2082.48 --> 2085.119
of funny that's okay i just don't think

2084.32 --> 2088.3990000000003
they're funny

2085.119 --> 2091.119
just realize that

2088.399 --> 2103.839
and they're not allowed in here either

2091.119 --> 2103.839
and neither is jason mccormack

2111.359 --> 2113.92
what's this

2115.52 --> 2122.8
yeah riley's got some trolls as well

2119.28 --> 2131.8390000000004
i really think i know who they are

2122.8 --> 2131.8390000000004
yeah there's no place for you here

2144.24 --> 2159.839
the hokage what the

2147.52 --> 2159.839
what does that even mean

2175.04 --> 2184.96
okay if you say so

2179.839 --> 2184.96
whatever vernacular you like buddy

2185.2 --> 2188.64
i tend to not reference stupid cartoons

2187.68 --> 2192.72
i tend to only

2188.64 --> 2192.72
reference cool cartoons

2192.88 --> 2201.839
because those are worth remembering but

2195.599 --> 2201.839
oh well

2205.92 --> 2208.88
ad hoc okay

2209.2 --> 2215.839
i need to remind myself what that is

2212.839 --> 2215.839
again

2219.76 --> 2229.8390000000004
oh god

2242.0 --> 2244.96
oh god

2246.32 --> 2259.989
all right

2256.79 --> 2259.989
[Music]

2266.72 --> 2284.3199999999997
you assume their globies are in they use

2269.839 --> 2287.359
that term a lot

2284.32 --> 2289.119
yeah i'm losing track in the

2287.359 --> 2292.88
conversations here it's

2289.119 --> 2295.359
yeah i really don't know how the freak

2292.88 --> 2296.079
owned benjamin knows how to keep track

2295.359 --> 2298.16
of this

2296.079 --> 2299.92
type of stuff but i'm having a lot of

2298.16 --> 2300.64
trouble really following what you're

2299.92 --> 2304.16
saying

2300.64 --> 2304.16
then again i am kind of like

2305.119 --> 2308.7200000000003
not a comedian and really putting down

2307.359 --> 2311.92
complicated

2308.72 --> 2312.9599999999996
trains of thought and he does it too but

2311.92 --> 2317.6800000000003
not

2312.96 --> 2319.599
indirect roulette with the chat

2317.68 --> 2322.7999999999997
because everybody there is just goofing

2319.599 --> 2322.8
around constantly

2324.839 --> 2327.839
so

2334.4 --> 2341.839
oh god no no tom parker

2337.92 --> 2341.839
or maybe i have i don't remember

2348.56 --> 2352.0789999999997
you know that a lot of people do like

2351.04 --> 2355.839
suggest

2352.079 --> 2355.8390000000004
like watch this watch that

2356.16 --> 2358.72
usually

2362.72 --> 2366.64
oh that's pretty big prior to taking

2374.8 --> 2384.8
yeah i've seen him before

2382.88 --> 2386.88
i have i haven't really watched his

2384.8 --> 2390.6400000000003
videos or anything

2386.88 --> 2390.6400000000003
yeah maybe i should check him out

2394.16 --> 2400.0
but yeah but i have a suspicion that i

2397.04 --> 2404.4
don't like his style too much

2400.0 --> 2406.56
i'm not a hundred percent sure

2404.4 --> 2408.48
anyway i subscribe to him this time so

2406.56 --> 2409.92
that i'm not gonna forget

2408.48 --> 2412.079
because this channel does kind of look

2409.92 --> 2416.079
interesting

2412.079 --> 2425.8390000000004
at least to figure out what it's about

2416.079 --> 2425.8390000000004
uh hey the miss kang

2436.839 --> 2439.839
what

2453.119 --> 2460.2400000000002
huh well nw dude uh

2457.119 --> 2462.079
you'd yeah technically pay

2460.24 --> 2463.52
him to bnd live not really you have to

2462.079 --> 2465.28
be subscribed but there's a lot of

2463.52 --> 2467.44
people that actually do a handout

2465.28 --> 2470.1600000000003
subscriptions there

2467.44 --> 2471.119
i've have been kind of getting around

2470.16 --> 2474.96
and watching

2471.119 --> 2477.28
for at least half a year just by getting

2474.96 --> 2480.4
subscriptions from other people so

2477.28 --> 2481.44
it's not that difficult and hey you can

2480.4 --> 2484.7200000000003
still watch it

2481.44 --> 2487.68
you know there's enough people

2484.72 --> 2489.52
blabbering in there so

2487.68 --> 2491.2799999999997
and it's not really a great platform to

2489.52 --> 2492.56
have a back and forth conversation

2491.28 --> 2495.6800000000003
because like

2492.56 --> 2499.68
yeah it goes so fast

2495.68 --> 2501.359
it's crazy yeah before you know it

2499.68 --> 2503.359
something you're responding to is just

2501.359 --> 2506.4
out of the screen it's just you can't

2503.359 --> 2506.4
even look back anymore

2506.839 --> 2509.839
so

2514.24 --> 2518.3999999999996
sometimes though you know i've been able

2516.88 --> 2521.599
to put down

2518.4 --> 2524.7200000000003
some sensible sentences in there

2521.599 --> 2525.28
in my time and hey benjamin even reads

2524.72 --> 2527.68
them

2525.28 --> 2528.6400000000003
reads them out light he it doesn't or he

2527.68 --> 2531.2
rarely actually

2528.64 --> 2532.24
finishes the whole thing but yeah he

2531.2 --> 2535.1189999999997
does read out some

2532.24 --> 2536.9599999999996
things i say because hey i i really try

2535.119 --> 2540.319
to put good things down there i'm not

2536.96 --> 2543.359
just blabbering i'm really

2540.319 --> 2546.16
trying to like work with the program

2543.359 --> 2546.16
that's what i do

2547.52 --> 2553.119
in chat typically or if

2550.64 --> 2554.8799999999997
yeah if it's something else that's a

2553.119 --> 2555.2000000000003
little less engaging then i'm gonna work

2554.88 --> 2558.2400000000002
with

2555.2 --> 2560.0789999999997
my program and i'm gonna insert the my

2558.24 --> 2561.839
law or my typical lore which i don't

2560.079 --> 2563.599
always do you know because it is kind of

2561.839 --> 2564.16
like distracting it is really its own

2563.599 --> 2567.76
subject

2564.16 --> 2571.04
often people don't expect it

2567.76 --> 2571.0400000000004
are we in inquisition

2571.599 --> 2579.839
there will be a test

2590.839 --> 2593.839
hmm

2599.76 --> 2607.2000000000003
okay youtube it's up to you

2603.359 --> 2621.839
if you look into the darkness then yeah

2607.2 --> 2621.839
that's what you get

2632.839 --> 2638.56
what

2634.56 --> 2638.56
yeah i bet you do orochimaru

2640.8 --> 2644.7200000000003
yeah i bet you still have your own

2642.8 --> 2646.6400000000003
issues that you would like to keep

2644.72 --> 2650.72
private and yeah he constantly

2646.64 --> 2652.48
pushes everything everything so yeah

2650.72 --> 2654.0789999999997
there's gonna be some resentment that

2652.48 --> 2657.2
you're gonna have to deal with or

2654.079 --> 2658.7200000000003
not deal with it and then walk away i

2657.2 --> 2663.4399999999996
know

2658.72 --> 2667.1189999999997
yeah that's the test that's his test

2663.44 --> 2669.52
it's all a test and if you think you

2667.119 --> 2672.4
hate something then

2669.52 --> 2677.839
then you've got a problem because why

2672.4 --> 2677.839
why are you hating it

2679.44 --> 2682.8
but yeah

2683.04 --> 2687.44
to each their own i happen to really

2686.64 --> 2691.839
like

2687.44 --> 2691.839
what he does

2701.76 --> 2708.6400000000003
owen is whack what

2705.119 --> 2708.6400000000003
amanda young what does that mean

2711.599 --> 2719.44
is that like 80s whack

2715.839 --> 2722.319
or is that 2020 wag i don't know

2719.44 --> 2722.319
if there's a difference

2723.04 --> 2732.0
that could be good or bad or both i

2725.839 --> 2734.16
don't know

2732.0 --> 2735.119
maybe it's 70s i don't know when that

2734.16 --> 2739.359
was

2735.119 --> 2741.76
see before my generation he's boring

2739.359 --> 2741.7599999999998
what

2745.359 --> 2748.16
i don't think so

2751.599 --> 2760.1600000000003
yeah that's uh we don't need to know

2754.0 --> 2763.28
that hey jim

2760.16 --> 2766.16
hate eric tobay for the same reason are

2763.28 --> 2766.1600000000003
you serious

2768.24 --> 2771.68
i can't believe you're gonna compare

2770.079 --> 2775.8390000000004
them

2771.68 --> 2779.359
that's amazing

2775.839 --> 2784.319
the contrast is quite jarring

2779.359 --> 2784.319
he's shady why why

2785.52 --> 2791.119
he's boring and he's that that seems

2788.4 --> 2791.119
contradictive

2797.52 --> 2801.359
or are we talking about somebody else

2799.359 --> 2803.119
now you know because if you're just

2801.359 --> 2804.72
gonna put down an opinion

2803.119 --> 2806.8
and we're talking about several

2804.72 --> 2809.7599999999998
different people

2806.8 --> 2810.079
it's always handy to be very specific as

2809.76 --> 2813.599
to

2810.079 --> 2817.8390000000004
who you are referring to

2813.599 --> 2817.839
just saying

2819.37 --> 2822.46
[Music]

2827.76 --> 2831.8390000000004
eric to bay is the reason flat earthers

2830.64 --> 2837.04
flat earth exists

2831.839 --> 2837.04
are you serious come on tom parker

2837.28 --> 2845.8390000000004
just no

2847.599 --> 2861.6800000000003
what are you talking about

2858.079 --> 2866.079
we are all our controlled opposition

2861.68 --> 2868.0789999999997
i'm freaking control opposition everyone

2866.079 --> 2870.079
that actually does anything becomes

2868.079 --> 2872.7200000000003
control opposition

2870.079 --> 2873.119
it's like oh you're opposing us right

2872.72 --> 2875.2
okay

2873.119 --> 2876.6400000000003
well as long as you don't step out of

2875.2 --> 2878.7999999999997
your boundaries

2876.64 --> 2881.2799999999997
we'll just leave you do that and defend

2878.8 --> 2884.1600000000003
your territory and

2881.28 --> 2884.6400000000003
yeah control that position everyone is

2884.16 --> 2887.44
control

2884.64 --> 2889.2
opposition everyone that does anything

2887.44 --> 2890.48
is controlled opposition because if they

2889.2 --> 2893.5989999999997
were not controlled

2890.48 --> 2893.599
they'd be removed

2893.76 --> 2901.8390000000004
control opposition is about things under

2898.839 --> 2901.839
control

2906.96 --> 2910.8
that's just people that are wrong and

2908.88 --> 2912.96
there's people that are right

2910.8 --> 2914.0
and there's people that are right but in

2912.96 --> 2918.079
a wrong way and there's

2914.0 --> 2929.839
people that are yeah that's it

2918.079 --> 2929.8390000000004
you can't be wrong in in the right way

2938.96 --> 2943.839
who had fe fits out before eric

2948.0 --> 2953.839
vids out you mean on youtube because

2950.559 --> 2957.44
there's been flat earth subjects

2953.839 --> 2959.7599999999998
way way back you know

2957.44 --> 2961.04
or where there's just grave doubts being

2959.76 --> 2964.88
put on

2961.04 --> 2967.31
things a lot nasa being declared

2964.88 --> 2968.4
fake and all that yeah

2967.31 --> 2971.2799999999997
[Music]

2968.4 --> 2971.76
oh yeah eric dube made of like made a

2971.28 --> 2975.3590000000004
first

2971.76 --> 2977.28
mark like created a little territory in

2975.359 --> 2979.2
youtube and like said look i am the

2977.28 --> 2981.92
first yet because

2979.2 --> 2982.7999999999997
okay in youtube maybe he was the first i

2981.92 --> 2987.04
don't know

2982.8 --> 2989.599
he was the first to really make headway

2987.04 --> 2990.88
however that is you know maybe it was

2989.599 --> 2994.1600000000003
like a deal

2990.88 --> 2997.44
like okay since you are

2994.16 --> 2999.7599999999998
so savagne since you have this

2997.44 --> 3000.96
development that's actually detrimental

2999.76 --> 3003.2000000000003
they know that

3000.96 --> 3005.04
they all calculated on the charts it's

3003.2 --> 3006.7999999999997
like oh you're that level

3005.04 --> 3009.2799999999997
of personality this is how you're gonna

3006.8 --> 3012.319
do it right okay we will actually

3009.28 --> 3014.96
allow you to be promoted

3012.319 --> 3018.319
because yeah if it's gonna grow then let

3014.96 --> 3020.0
it grow on such an ugly stem

3018.319 --> 3021.599
and that's also a form of control

3020.0 --> 3025.04
opposition

3021.599 --> 3030.1600000000003
you know if you're too perfect in

3025.04 --> 3034.0
many ways you're not gonna get anywhere

3030.16 --> 3040.319
you know because they want

3034.0 --> 3044.16
certain traits to be hand-picked

3040.319 --> 3047.599
into certain subjects so they can steer

3044.16 --> 3047.5989999999997
the association

3048.48 --> 3050.72
right

3051.68 --> 3055.5989999999997
and i have my obvious weaknesses that i

3054.8 --> 3057.599
don't know

3055.599 --> 3059.52
everybody probably understands here or

3057.599 --> 3063.119
most of you or at least

3059.52 --> 3065.52
figure out like okay it is what it is

3063.119 --> 3068.079
at least it's under control you're doing

3065.52 --> 3071.2
something about it

3068.079 --> 3073.92
but that too might have even

3071.2 --> 3076.16
been like okay well arwen is weird our

3073.92 --> 3077.28
win isn't a total outsider our win is

3076.16 --> 3080.96
kind of

3077.28 --> 3083.52
socially crazy in ways

3080.96 --> 3084.64
although i am very much a complete

3083.52 --> 3086.96
person

3084.64 --> 3089.04
in between all that well maybe they

3086.96 --> 3092.16
think that's okay it's like okay well

3089.04 --> 3095.119
you're sufficiently insane to be

3092.16 --> 3097.68
championed as a flat earther because if

3095.119 --> 3100.48
i was just absolutely perfect and

3097.68 --> 3101.5989999999997
stable and never made a mistake and

3100.48 --> 3103.839
exactly knew

3101.599 --> 3105.44
everything how to do it yeah that'd be a

3103.839 --> 3109.2799999999997
big problem

3105.44 --> 3113.599
to them to the ones that are in control

3109.28 --> 3117.3590000000004
with whose platforms we are using

3113.599 --> 3119.6800000000003
okay so yeah there is only controlled

3117.359 --> 3121.92
opposition so how does that work

3119.68 --> 3123.2
how does the controlled opposition

3121.92 --> 3127.6800000000003
unspoken

3123.2 --> 3127.68
program work this is how it works

3128.4 --> 3134.48
you want to be part of it

3131.599 --> 3136.839
be part of it if you're too perfect then

3134.48 --> 3138.079
they have a problem and they don't allow

3136.839 --> 3139.92
it

3138.079 --> 3141.2000000000003
so yeah it's almost like they're trying

3139.92 --> 3142.96
to force you to choose your

3141.2 --> 3147.9199999999996
imperfections and

3142.96 --> 3150.96
don't don't fix it too well

3147.92 --> 3153.76
stay kooky stay

3150.96 --> 3154.88
slightly deranged stay naughty stay

3153.76 --> 3157.92
whatever but

3154.88 --> 3160.4
don't be too perfect that's they don't

3157.92 --> 3160.4
like that

3162.4 --> 3168.1600000000003
cia whatever sure

3165.68 --> 3168.16
why not

3171.28 --> 3183.0400000000004
just talking about the caretakers

3180.79 --> 3186.64
[Music]

3183.04 --> 3186.64
not me okay all right

3190.64 --> 3196.64
right but maybe with this

3194.4 --> 3197.44
view that i've just given maybe you

3196.64 --> 3200.72
understand

3197.44 --> 3201.68
more even now why i do things the way

3200.72 --> 3206.48
that i do

3201.68 --> 3208.5589999999997
why i've chosen to be insanely open

3206.48 --> 3209.76
and therefore showing these weaknesses

3208.559 --> 3213.6800000000003
that definitely are there

3209.76 --> 3217.6800000000003
but i am it's crazy

3213.68 --> 3217.68
but that's good

3217.92 --> 3226.079
because it gives me a unique thing

3222.96 --> 3230.079
that for yeah for someone like me

3226.079 --> 3230.079
really is pretty extraordinary

3231.359 --> 3237.119
because i stay so open

3234.48 --> 3239.839
i have this big virtual room and i let

3237.119 --> 3243.28
everything wander in there

3239.839 --> 3243.2799999999997
but i don't let it all stick

3244.24 --> 3248.64
but like i'm not afraid to be like

3246.48 --> 3252.72
perfectly honest

3248.64 --> 3252.72
even to those that seek out to

3252.88 --> 3256.319
tear me down to damage my spirit to

3255.359 --> 3259.5989999999997
weaken me to

3256.319 --> 3260.0
enslave me like no no you can see all of

3259.599 --> 3262.319
it

3260.0 --> 3263.28
you can see you can look me straight in

3262.319 --> 3266.319
the eye

3263.28 --> 3266.96
and you can even dive inside and look

3266.319 --> 3269.599
and

3266.96 --> 3270.559
talk to the sub personalities in my

3269.599 --> 3272.6400000000003
spirit

3270.559 --> 3274.48
if you can do such a thing in all of it

3272.64 --> 3278.0789999999997
and you'll find

3274.48 --> 3280.0
it's very much secure now

3278.079 --> 3281.76
very much secure anyway uh yeah sorry

3280.0 --> 3283.599
for ignoring chad

3281.76 --> 3284.88
uh thank you julio pappan for the ten

3283.599 --> 3287.119
dollar super chat

3284.88 --> 3288.2400000000002
donation or when is okay my book or when

3287.119 --> 3290.4
his ace awesome

3288.24 --> 3293.5989999999997
and rob wiggles thank you for the 10

3290.4 --> 3296.64
super chat donation also good morning

3293.599 --> 3299.52
and i did not answer you amanda young

3296.64 --> 3299.52
i'm not sure

3303.2 --> 3306.319
i don't know we were talking about

3304.72 --> 3309.4399999999996
controlled opposition about

3306.319 --> 3311.839
who was first on the internet eric debay

3309.44 --> 3313.76
why i think he was allowed on because he

3311.839 --> 3314.88
had cervane syndrome he basically

3313.76 --> 3318.0
introduced it

3314.88 --> 3320.96
to try and make flat earthers all

3318.0 --> 3324.64
savonias it's good to them it's like a

3320.96 --> 3327.359
a permanent weakness that will be

3324.64 --> 3328.72
have a bigger chance to be on imprinted

3327.359 --> 3331.92
upon the entire

3328.72 --> 3335.4399999999996
newly forming community

3331.92 --> 3338.48
internet community see engineering

3335.44 --> 3341.52
social engineering

3338.48 --> 3344.2400000000002
natural like a

3341.52 --> 3345.52
a foundational system that is just

3344.24 --> 3348.9599999999996
presented to be

3345.52 --> 3352.4
used or ignored

3348.96 --> 3354.96
uh but yeah eric debay was

3352.4 --> 3355.6800000000003
first look i've i've even said like i've

3354.96 --> 3358.0
seen

3355.68 --> 3360.799
a video of him on somebody's phone in

3358.0 --> 3360.799
97.

3360.839 --> 3363.839
so

3364.72 --> 3372.24
yeah the youtube staff and w dude

3368.24 --> 3374.3999999999996
the youtube staff does that and lots of

3372.24 --> 3375.7599999999998
ballers that just really freaking hate

3374.4 --> 3378.2400000000002
me

3375.76 --> 3379.3590000000004
they're probably afraid that i'm going

3378.24 --> 3381.2799999999997
to turn out

3379.359 --> 3383.04
yeah that i'm gonna even get more

3381.28 --> 3384.88
fanatical and i don't know put them in

3383.04 --> 3388.72
death camps or something

3384.88 --> 3388.7200000000003
you never know you know

3388.96 --> 3393.68
right but don't worry about that

3392.16 --> 3395.52
if it's going to come down to that it's

3393.68 --> 3405.839
not going to be me doing it so

3395.52 --> 3405.839
i wouldn't worry about that too much

3429.76 --> 3433.8390000000004
are you talking about oh well it's

3432.079 --> 3435.2000000000003
already three o'clock man now the time

3433.839 --> 3437.44
has flown i'm like

3435.2 --> 3438.319
okay i want to get to a real subject now

3437.44 --> 3441.2000000000003
and it's like oh

3438.319 --> 3442.319
[ __ ] it's three o'clock already we did

3441.2 --> 3445.2799999999997
kind of get to a

3442.319 --> 3447.52
subject it's been a bit over the place

3445.28 --> 3451.0400000000004
trouble

3447.52 --> 3451.04
finding cohesion in chat

3453.119 --> 3457.92
but i guess it's i have myself partially

3455.76 --> 3460.7200000000003
to blame because i have kind of

3457.92 --> 3462.0
tightened up the chatted little

3460.72 --> 3464.5589999999997
basically

3462.0 --> 3465.44
demanding you all put more effort into

3464.559 --> 3467.44
what you do

3465.44 --> 3470.96
and that causes like all these strains

3467.44 --> 3470.96
of thoughts to basically now

3471.359 --> 3475.839
all at once get in there and then i have

3473.599 --> 3476.319
to look a little deeper i didn't i can't

3475.839 --> 3478.48
just

3476.319 --> 3480.319
glance over it superficially and then

3478.48 --> 3481.68
get it because there's more there now i

3480.319 --> 3486.5589999999997
do notice that

3481.68 --> 3486.5589999999997

there dude it's just that jason

3546.559 --> 3550.96
mccartney

3547.68 --> 3554.48
had it was him he was identified

3550.96 --> 3554.48
and he has with a man

3554.88 --> 3559.839
a man like jung and you said he was your

3558.4 --> 3563.28
brother

3559.839 --> 3567.52
and i hope that he's not your literal

3563.28 --> 3569.52
flesh and broad blood sibling brother

3567.52 --> 3572.559
because if you're literally the sister

3569.52 --> 3575.599
of jason mccormack that's [ __ ]

3572.559 --> 3577.76
so i hope because you did say that you

3575.599 --> 3579.6800000000003
were not literal about that

3577.76 --> 3581.0400000000004
you were trying to be metaphorical or

3579.68 --> 3584.319
whatever because

3581.04 --> 3587.119
that guy i don't like him and i don't

3584.319 --> 3588.079
want anyone to protect him or give him

3587.119 --> 3590.559
