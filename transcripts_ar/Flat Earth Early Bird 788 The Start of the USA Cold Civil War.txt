right so later today is

84.159 --> 89.28
quite beautiful again look at that

89.84 --> 97.759
sun is out and bright there's a few

94.159 --> 97.759
clouds they're kind of thin

98.32 --> 102.55999999999999
it's really nice and sunny no wind

105.759 --> 109.92
it's a little cold though there's a lot

108.56 --> 112.64
of moist in the air it

109.92 --> 115.84
is still cold like look if that sun goes

112.64 --> 118.88
away it's probably gonna get really cold

115.84 --> 121.36
but it's really nice and warm and bright

118.88 --> 121.36
right now

122.64 --> 131.92
pretty beautiful sight

129.599 --> 131.92
right

132.879 --> 139.51999999999998
tuesday the 26th january

136.52 --> 139.52
2021

141.52 --> 143.84
right

148.0 --> 157.84
let's see

159.36 --> 164.0
so still waiting for people to come into

168.84 --> 176.48
chat

171.599 --> 176.48
i was just watching

177.44 --> 181.35999999999999
a bit of owen benjamin i didn't see it

180.56 --> 184.4
last night

181.36 --> 187.44000000000003
so i just watched it pretty much

184.4 --> 190.72
just a snippet but it was a great clip

187.44 --> 192.07999999999998
just a little clip that just really hit

190.72 --> 196.4
the spot

192.08 --> 199.28
where he showed some video of two dogs

196.4 --> 200.87900000000002
like barking at one another through

199.28 --> 204.72
through a fence and then the

200.879 --> 208.0
fence like electronically opened up

204.72 --> 208.48
and then they stopped barking and just

208.0 --> 211.44
be like

208.48 --> 213.2
ah hello then it closed back off and

211.44 --> 214.72
then they started barking again through

213.2 --> 218.39999999999998
the fence

214.72 --> 219.2
it's yeah and that that was a metaphor

218.4 --> 221.519
and maybe

219.2 --> 223.35999999999999
it is literally an effect some kind of

221.519 --> 225.92000000000002
social effect

223.36 --> 227.92000000000002
where own benjamin of course compared it

225.92 --> 231.11999999999998
to humans

227.92 --> 233.439
and in comment sections and behind chat

231.12 --> 235.76
versus when they actually go face to

233.439 --> 235.76
face

235.92 --> 239.04
now i myself have also been kind of

238.08 --> 242.48000000000002
pointing out

239.04 --> 243.28
this effect because i yeah i tend to get

242.48 --> 246.159
a lot more

243.28 --> 248.159
aggressive on the internet than people

246.159 --> 251.519
will ever see me

248.159 --> 252.48
in face to face and i it's like i can't

251.519 --> 255.76
really

252.48 --> 259.12
turn that off as well it's just a

255.76 --> 259.12
different way of doing things

259.68 --> 263.84000000000003
but yeah the demonstration with that

261.759 --> 267.36
fence i thought was pretty

263.84 --> 270.32
hilarious and really on target

267.36 --> 271.84000000000003
anyway it's good gaining wisdom is in

270.32 --> 274.56
chat

271.84 --> 274.56
good to see you

276.72 --> 285.36
julio pepin i got green tea with me

281.36 --> 288.639
by the way still hot

285.36 --> 288.639
a tiny wombo

294.639 --> 299.12
oh yay huh

299.28 --> 303.84
sadly everybody comes rolling in that's

301.6 --> 303.84000000000003
good

309.84 --> 313.19899999999996
right so i'm currently in a sort of a

311.84 --> 325.84
good mood and i'm

313.199 --> 325.84000000000003
gonna try to keep in that good mood

326.24 --> 333.28000000000003
because of the nice sun it really does

329.12 --> 333.28000000000003
improve my mood very dramatically

333.68 --> 337.44
it is pretty much every time i wake up

335.919 --> 340.4
with it

337.44 --> 340.8
i feel just a lot better when there's

340.4 --> 344.32
just

340.8 --> 347.84000000000003
sun also because

344.32 --> 348.4
well typically i kind of wake up with

347.84 --> 351.28
the sun

348.4 --> 351.84
shining in my face because around 12

351.28 --> 355.19899999999996
o'clock

351.84 --> 355.919
it it does kind of the sun position is

355.199 --> 359.12
in a way that

355.919 --> 361.12
yeah my curtains they don't completely

359.12 --> 363.36
close it's kind of embarrassing it's

361.12 --> 366.4
just that these curtains were never

363.36 --> 368.319
specifically designed for this room for

366.4 --> 370.88
these window sizes

368.319 --> 372.639
they were just curtains that i had been

370.88 --> 375.68
well taking along from

372.639 --> 376.88
place to place because i had them

375.68 --> 379.6
they're pretty good

376.88 --> 380.0
thick curtains but yeah there's one spot

379.6 --> 384.16
open

380.0 --> 386.24
which is like right over there and then

384.16 --> 387.6
around 12 o'clock it tends to shine

386.24 --> 390.8
directly onto

387.6 --> 392.8
where my where my pillow is

390.8 --> 395.84000000000003
where my head is in the morning so

392.8 --> 399.199
that's kind of funny how that works out

395.84 --> 400.71999999999997
i kind of like it that way except when

399.199 --> 402.08
the moon is freaking over there

400.72 --> 404.56
middle of the night when i'm trying to

402.08 --> 406.56
sleep like i've had times where there's

404.56 --> 408.0
a full moon shining right in my face

406.56 --> 410.8
when i'm trying to sleep as well

408.0 --> 414.16
that was really annoying but yeah then i

410.8 --> 414.16
can just always turn around

414.639 --> 418.88
put my pillow on the other side and

416.16 --> 418.88000000000005
sleep like that

418.96 --> 423.84
right anyway

425.44 --> 437.84
the sun

438.08 --> 441.52
yeah tiny wumbo i see you

449.44 --> 453.84
robin stanley good to see you

459.199 --> 465.84000000000003
all right so i'm open for talking about

462.72 --> 465.84000000000003
lots of things i guess

475.84 --> 479.75899999999996
still no ubermokul yeah i think that

478.08 --> 482.0
obomoko might have just left the

479.759 --> 483.52000000000004
internet

482.0 --> 485.199
except i haven't seen him around

483.52 --> 488.96
anywhere

485.199 --> 488.96000000000004
hope nothing bad happened again

489.599 --> 493.84
but i don't know

495.84 --> 501.039
maybe he's just done interacting and

499.68 --> 503.68
it's just watching

501.039 --> 505.039
that that works just as well for them

503.68 --> 521.839
for him

505.039 --> 521.8389999999999
i'm assuming it's him

526.84 --> 534.08
[Music]

530.56 --> 536.4799999999999
right oh yeah i did see that that was

534.08 --> 536.48
weird

537.36 --> 541.6800000000001
but there's this weird thing going on

540.24 --> 545.76
seriously

541.68 --> 546.56
with well with the us political system

545.76 --> 549.04
and

546.56 --> 552.2399999999999
yeah the dualities they're in and it

549.04 --> 552.24
seems like every time

553.04 --> 556.16
it's already kind of been pointed out

554.72 --> 558.5600000000001
about the past

556.16 --> 560.7199999999999
every time a group that says they are

558.56 --> 564.0
pro something

560.72 --> 567.839
gets into power it's them that

564.0 --> 570.64
actually almost like execute the agenda

567.839 --> 574.1600000000001
of the opposite side

570.64 --> 576.64
and i wonder really if that is with both

574.16 --> 578.88
sides because

576.64 --> 582.08
they're really one side and all they

578.88 --> 584.88
want to do is progress the agenda so

582.08 --> 587.2
because it's split up they use the

584.88 --> 590.24
polarization to get away with it

587.2 --> 593.44
by constantly just

590.24 --> 595.2
both sides attacking

593.44 --> 597.2
both sides of the other side that are

595.2 --> 599.6800000000001
being kept preoccupied with

597.2 --> 601.76
one another instead of just realizing

599.68 --> 604.88
hey

601.76 --> 605.68
every time we vote for our side they get

604.88 --> 608.0
into power

605.68 --> 610.4799999999999
we're the ones actually secretly getting

608.0 --> 614.0
attacked like the media maybe

610.48 --> 618.0790000000001
on your side or some part or

614.0 --> 621.04
might be experiencing is good

618.079 --> 621.519
yeah how i came to this conclusion was

621.04 --> 624.64
that

621.519 --> 624.64
where was this article

625.519 --> 628.48
it was so weird

630.079 --> 635.279
but there was some crackdown on antifa

632.56 --> 638.2399999999999
that there's like this anti-biden antifa

635.279 --> 638.24
group apparently

640.56 --> 647.8389999999999
dammit where did i find that i think it

643.279 --> 647.8389999999999
was infowars

650.56 --> 654.8
so i wonder if that's just like a

656.64 --> 663.519
how real that is because it yeah it's

660.079 --> 663.519
just me bumping into that

663.68 --> 666.7199999999999
but i wonder it like

668.079 --> 676.8
just taking that that system

671.839 --> 676.8000000000001
into mind like what could happen

684.32 --> 689.839
he apt man is back

695.519 --> 700.5600000000001
you've been informed you used to be

697.6 --> 700.5600000000001
called what

701.36 --> 708.8000000000001
run home arwen what the

704.88 --> 712.8
dude your sentence

708.8 --> 716.0
structure's not correct

712.8 --> 719.76
not comprehensive

716.0 --> 722.24
is more comprehensible i

719.76 --> 722.24
the [ __ ]

728.959 --> 733.3599999999999
or your english is just really terrible

734.24 --> 739.36
we got a stalker i i don't know about

736.72 --> 739.36
the stalker

742.839 --> 745.839
okay

750.8 --> 758.7199999999999
whatever but yeah i

754.48 --> 761.76
i noticed this that may be

758.72 --> 765.44
roughly estimating that now that the

761.76 --> 765.4399999999999
democrats are back in power

765.76 --> 770.639
their side has been riled up completely

768.399 --> 772.72
out of control for a while now

770.639 --> 774.32
so maybe they're going to attempt to do

772.72 --> 775.9200000000001
some damage control

774.32 --> 778.24
because otherwise it's just going to

775.92 --> 780.56
reflect so bad

778.24 --> 782.72
that the political control system is

780.56 --> 786.7199999999999
going to lose grip

782.72 --> 788.9590000000001
something like that right

786.72 --> 791.44
so who knows what's actually going to

788.959 --> 794.4799999999999
transpire in the us

791.44 --> 798.0
besides trump supporters

794.48 --> 798.0
being constantly harassed

798.24 --> 802.399
because that's probably still gonna

800.079 --> 802.399
happen

812.88 --> 820.72
also i've been reflecting a lot

816.16 --> 823.519
on what i do even with the show

820.72 --> 824.24
and like the stances that i've been

823.519 --> 828.639
taking and

824.24 --> 831.6800000000001
also revealing so much about myself and

828.639 --> 833.04
like trying to be honest about that i do

831.68 --> 837.92
realize i'm just

833.04 --> 841.04
some guy i technically don't really

837.92 --> 844.4799999999999
have any financially

841.04 --> 849.12
yeah financial big career or anything

844.48 --> 852.8000000000001
and i'm a layman in a lot of what i do

849.12 --> 856.24
and i'm very driven by

852.8 --> 859.5999999999999
yeah by my passions and by basically

856.24 --> 862.0
naturally finding a way to

859.6 --> 863.76
naturally want to do something and then

862.0 --> 865.68
it works so much better

863.76 --> 866.959
using that as a system this is very

865.68 --> 870.0
tough

866.959 --> 873.4399999999999
and in ways you know in what i do

870.0 --> 875.76
overall it's

873.44 --> 878.32
such a double-edged sword because in one

875.76 --> 879.8389999999999
side i feel very successful at what i

878.32 --> 882.9590000000001
kind of set out to do

879.839 --> 886.0790000000001
like i've maintained this purity

882.959 --> 889.4399999999999
in a way on the other hand i've been

886.079 --> 889.4399999999999
very unsuccessful

889.519 --> 895.199
so there's this constant duality to it

892.88 --> 895.199
and

896.48 --> 899.6800000000001
yeah it's like yeah i made it but now

899.04 --> 902.079
i'm

899.68 --> 903.92
almost like locked in and it's

902.079 --> 906.2399999999999
constantly trying to figure a way

903.92 --> 906.24
through

910.88 --> 915.6
and it is also constantly being dangled

914.32 --> 919.6800000000001
in my face in ways

915.6 --> 921.6
like yeah if you just hadn't done this

919.68 --> 923.04
you would be somewhere entirely

921.6 --> 926.32
different and things would

923.04 --> 928.3199999999999
appear to you much smoother and much

926.32 --> 930.0790000000001
less worrying and all that and who knows

928.32 --> 931.12
what i might have been able to achieve

930.079 --> 933.12
with that

931.12 --> 934.24
but then i always keep on thinking like

933.12 --> 937.279
but

934.24 --> 938.839
if i hadn't done all this then i would

937.279 --> 941.8389999999999
have never

938.839 --> 945.839
known and then i

941.839 --> 948.5600000000001
probably wouldn't really care even to do

945.839 --> 950.0790000000001
bigger things because i would never get

948.56 --> 953.279
to the

950.079 --> 956.8
the drive the necessity

953.279 --> 960.079
that essence because i didn't take this

956.8 --> 960.079
challenge so it's like this

963.36 --> 968.32
where do yeah duality for myself like

966.839 --> 971.36
that

968.32 --> 972.32
but yeah i i have done this i am doing

971.36 --> 975.12
this

972.32 --> 976.0
there like there is no way really to

975.12 --> 980.5600000000001
turn it around

976.0 --> 980.56
it that'll just yeah

981.12 --> 984.399
that's like stepping away

985.6 --> 991.279
but i do wonder sometimes like

988.639 --> 993.199
am i practically now burning have i

991.279 --> 995.8389999999999
burned so many bridges that there's just

993.199 --> 998.0
no way back

995.839 --> 1000.0
like not even from person to person but

998.0 --> 1001.12
just in the way i conducted myself and

1000.0 --> 1004.0
like in the future

1001.12 --> 1004.88
everything that i've done here that i've

1004.0 --> 1010.88
said

1004.88 --> 1015.8389999999999
the stances that i've taken like is that

1010.88 --> 1018.079
would people still trust me

1015.839 --> 1020.399
it's like would you trust somebody that

1018.079 --> 1023.3599999999999
is so unbelievably honest

1020.399 --> 1024.0
that they would just say everything even

1023.36 --> 1026.64
sensitive

1024.0 --> 1030.24
things just life to the entire world

1026.64 --> 1030.24
would you trust somebody like that

1032.16 --> 1034.4
it's

1035.439 --> 1040.72
i don't know

1038.48 --> 1042.24
but that's also i guess why sometimes

1040.72 --> 1045.839
ask people like hey

1042.24 --> 1048.559
what what am i

1045.839 --> 1048.559
do you know

1050.84 --> 1056.9599999999998
huh you meet someone who claims he went

1054.16 --> 1056.96
to school with you

1065.6 --> 1069.12
ran to my house

1070.32 --> 1072.559
uh

1078.84 --> 1081.84
no

1088.88 --> 1096.7990000000002
trust just talking about that with

1094.48 --> 1096.799
all right

1097.6 --> 1101.12
well i'm glad that i that other people

1100.24 --> 1103.36
have also

1101.12 --> 1105.6
taken notice of this like i'm having

1103.36 --> 1107.76
issues for myself like

1105.6 --> 1108.7199999999998
how to compose myself and all this with

1107.76 --> 1112.64
everyth with

1108.72 --> 1115.039
with my things it's like i have a

1112.64 --> 1116.88
kind of a purity policy for me but it's

1115.039 --> 1122.48
also in ways keeping me

1116.88 --> 1125.5200000000002
in the dark it's making me

1122.48 --> 1126.16
it's just this friendly policy also

1125.52 --> 1130.4
makes me

1126.16 --> 1133.28
avoid getting into yeah into the the

1130.4 --> 1136.3200000000002
depths of how dirty other people can be

1133.28 --> 1139.44
on their own like avoiding ballers

1136.32 --> 1141.36
like baller channels i've been i haven't

1139.44 --> 1143.039
really watched any of that in a long

1141.36 --> 1145.36
time

1143.039 --> 1146.72
it's just the ballast i get confronted

1145.36 --> 1150.3999999999999
with they're mostly now in the flat

1146.72 --> 1153.2
earth debates

1150.4 --> 1154.48
and of course in my chat and here they

1153.2 --> 1157.8400000000001
behave

1154.48 --> 1160.88
or they get a timeout or get banned

1157.84 --> 1164.1599999999999
right so that's different

1160.88 --> 1166.96
but because of this i'm also just i know

1164.16 --> 1169.44
from memory like how dirty thing people

1166.96 --> 1172.64
can get

1169.44 --> 1175.1200000000001
but i'm not used to it anymore because i

1172.64 --> 1178.16
used to kind of like bathe in that [ __ ]

1175.12 --> 1178.9599999999998
literally this is constantly going

1178.16 --> 1181.1200000000001
around being

1178.96 --> 1182.4
among ballers that's really also how it

1181.12 --> 1183.6
all started

1182.4 --> 1186.5590000000002
and there was a lot more energy

1183.6 --> 1188.6399999999999
available for that now

1186.559 --> 1190.24
it's like yeah we found our way through

1188.64 --> 1192.24
as flat earthers we have

1190.24 --> 1194.72
really strong arguments we really

1192.24 --> 1197.2
understand the material but

1194.72 --> 1199.52
the other side's just unrepenting in

1197.2 --> 1199.52
ways

1200.799 --> 1206.559
and so is there still any use to

1204.32 --> 1208.8799999999999
go and sit in between that and just be

1206.559 --> 1210.24
subjected to the same nonsense over and

1208.88 --> 1213.8400000000001
over again even though

1210.24 --> 1213.84
your arguments are much better

1216.72 --> 1220.32
what is my purity policy my purity

1219.679 --> 1223.1200000000001
policy

1220.32 --> 1223.12
is about just

1225.36 --> 1230.24
driving good behavior trying to

1231.36 --> 1237.6789999999999
send that out basically set out

1235.28 --> 1238.72
a better type of example of a better

1237.679 --> 1241.52
code of conduct

1238.72 --> 1241.52
better way to

1241.919 --> 1244.7990000000002
to present

1245.2 --> 1252.159
and then yeah because that is known to

1248.64 --> 1254.24
directly influence others and then

1252.159 --> 1256.24
i don't know if enough people take that

1254.24 --> 1259.6
serious

1256.24 --> 1262.4
you could have like this

1259.6 --> 1263.28
yeah all this energy that builds up

1262.4 --> 1267.52
connected

1263.28 --> 1270.1589999999999
even through who inspired it

1267.52 --> 1271.52
and yeah if you go down into dirty

1270.159 --> 1275.8400000000001
behavior that too

1271.52 --> 1278.48
echoes on now people just go squirting

1275.84 --> 1279.4399999999998
i've been trying to take it the other

1278.48 --> 1283.28
way around and it

1279.44 --> 1286.3200000000002
is one of the original strengths

1283.28 --> 1288.32
of the truth movement like building that

1286.32 --> 1291.84
energy

1288.32 --> 1293.84
like really good intention and

1291.84 --> 1294.8799999999999
because of well everything that's

1293.84 --> 1298.72
transpired in

1294.88 --> 1302.5590000000002
over the last decade it's just

1298.72 --> 1303.799
a lot of evil has arisen

1302.559 --> 1307.2
on the other side and there's

1303.799 --> 1311.2
demoralization it's like

1307.2 --> 1313.919
it's not as quick as it seemed

1311.2 --> 1314.64
all of it it's a much more of a slow

1313.919 --> 1318.8400000000001
process

1314.64 --> 1320.0
and so just figuring out again like

1318.84 --> 1322.799
[Music]

1320.0 --> 1325.52
how do we build another momentum we've

1322.799 --> 1325.52
learned a lot

1325.679 --> 1330.0
and i think that just trying to overcome

1330.159 --> 1337.2
the rising of the dark behavior

1333.6 --> 1339.6789999999999
can only truly be achieved by

1337.2 --> 1340.64
not engaging with that and trying to

1339.679 --> 1344.799
shut it out

1340.64 --> 1344.7990000000002
while not shutting out communication

1344.84 --> 1349.36
itself

1346.0 --> 1351.76
right and the savonier syndrome will

1349.36 --> 1352.3999999999999
make you do exactly the opposite it will

1351.76 --> 1354.48
make you

1352.4 --> 1356.0
bite it will make you engage and smash

1354.48 --> 1358.559
them and prove to them that you are

1356.0 --> 1360.799
superior and blah blah all that

1358.559 --> 1363.12
right i'm trying to do the exact

1360.799 --> 1374.32
opposite

1363.12 --> 1379.039
but yeah it also isolates me in ways

1374.32 --> 1379.039
yeah good sir but good servant gets that

1386.84 --> 1393.039
huh

1389.76 --> 1393.039
right but the problem is

1393.36 --> 1396.6399999999999
typical mechanism to do something

1395.919 --> 1399.919
positive

1396.64 --> 1403.44
quickly right is to kind of

1399.919 --> 1406.96
shut out reality of things

1403.44 --> 1408.88
it ways this is like the easiest

1406.96 --> 1410.24
mechanism is just forget about it and

1408.88 --> 1412.3200000000002
then everything is all right

1410.24 --> 1414.96
right so this is what most people use

1412.32 --> 1418.3999999999999
but the problem is is that

1414.96 --> 1418.4
that doesn't really work

1419.2 --> 1426.88
it's very hard to retract like that

1424.0 --> 1427.36
so it's like you have to deal with it

1426.88 --> 1431.8400000000001
yet

1427.36 --> 1431.84
not become it

1434.72 --> 1438.48
but yeah in order to do that you have to

1436.64 --> 1438.7990000000002
first understand what it is so i guess

1438.48 --> 1441.279
that

1438.799 --> 1442.4
engaging and a lot of people will at

1441.279 --> 1444.24
first engage with

1442.4 --> 1445.679
dirty ballers that are nasty and all

1444.24 --> 1448.08
that it is all

1445.679 --> 1449.44
it is about figuring it out it is about

1448.08 --> 1454.24
figuring out the lie

1449.44 --> 1456.64
like why what drives these people

1454.24 --> 1458.799
and then after a while if you've not

1456.64 --> 1461.679
turned into a total safanye

1458.799 --> 1464.32
like you enjoy it too much right

1461.679 --> 1464.3200000000002
engaging

1464.64 --> 1469.76
then when you've mastered the

1466.88 --> 1471.6000000000001
understanding of what is going on here

1469.76 --> 1472.8799999999999
what is going on with these people why

1471.6 --> 1476.1589999999999
do they do it

1472.88 --> 1476.7990000000002
the way they do and realizing also that

1476.159 --> 1479.279
they are

1476.799 --> 1480.32
engaging in fooling themselves that

1479.279 --> 1483.679
fooling

1480.32 --> 1488.08
one's self is

1483.679 --> 1492.799
a very key factor in like how

1488.08 --> 1494.8799999999999
society is built is really weird

1492.799 --> 1496.6399999999999
but once you do once you figure that out

1494.88 --> 1500.4
then

1496.64 --> 1502.72
you have to kind of disengage because

1500.4 --> 1504.64
the interaction and the aggression and

1502.72 --> 1509.2
the psychological warfare will

1504.64 --> 1511.679
shut you off from the rest of the world

1509.2 --> 1512.799
that's also yeah an escape mechanism it

1511.679 --> 1516.48
can be used like that

1512.799 --> 1519.039
to escape from the world see but so

1516.48 --> 1520.0
to disengage then you start yet then you

1519.039 --> 1522.24
can step away

1520.0 --> 1523.279
it becomes like a memory you can learn

1522.24 --> 1525.36
from

1523.279 --> 1527.12
instead of constantly going back for

1525.36 --> 1530.6399999999999
more

1527.12 --> 1534.4799999999998
and then you can find another challenge

1530.64 --> 1534.48
another thing to try and puzzle

1535.039 --> 1538.08
it's like you have to

1539.279 --> 1545.279
oh okay see you later thanks for popping

1543.039 --> 1545.279
by

1554.0 --> 1557.44
you can recognize dark stuff and not

1556.0 --> 1560.88
engage

1557.44 --> 1564.3200000000002
yes the issue though is is that

1560.88 --> 1566.88
what is dark stuff it is

1564.32 --> 1567.6789999999999
so a lot of dark stuff is also bluff

1566.88 --> 1571.8400000000001
it's just

1567.679 --> 1571.8400000000001
horrors of people's imagination

1574.88 --> 1582.4
and it is kind of i thought

1579.12 --> 1584.9599999999998
i used to think i was younger 20 years

1582.4 --> 1587.919
ago that

1584.96 --> 1588.559
learning like why why does that happen

1587.919 --> 1592.3200000000002
like

1588.559 --> 1594.799
what why does that exist

1592.32 --> 1597.2
what is really happening what does it do

1594.799 --> 1597.2
to you

1597.84 --> 1602.32
and yeah it's been a puzzle for me in my

1599.919 --> 1605.6000000000001
entire life how much of it is actually

1602.32 --> 1613.84
real of all the darkness we're being

1605.6 --> 1613.84
confronted with

1620.48 --> 1627.52
all right because a lot of darkness

1624.08 --> 1630.48
that is made over it is usually

1627.52 --> 1630.48
a distraction

1630.88 --> 1636.159
it's like oh this it's so in your face

1634.559 --> 1638.32
it's usually a sign that there's

1636.159 --> 1641.8400000000001
something less in your face that it's

1638.32 --> 1641.84
going to distract away from

1646.559 --> 1653.2
right and then things become

1649.84 --> 1655.279
really complicated like how does it

1653.2 --> 1659.96
really work

1655.279 --> 1663.2
it's like these mechanisms are are

1659.96 --> 1665.8400000000001
industrialized and we can see the signs

1663.2 --> 1669.1200000000001
of that like even the

1665.84 --> 1671.9189999999999
the american political system reveals

1669.12 --> 1671.9189999999999
these traits

1674.48 --> 1680.84
constantly saying no the other one

1677.919 --> 1682.72
the other one it's like two guys that

1680.84 --> 1685.1999999999998
are

1682.72 --> 1686.88
brothers are just like stepping away

1685.2 --> 1688.72
from one another in a crowd and just

1686.88 --> 1693.7600000000002
saying they're default day

1688.72 --> 1696.32
they and then basically people join them

1693.76 --> 1697.44
on both sides while the the brothers

1696.32 --> 1701.4399999999998
were originally

1697.44 --> 1704.88
basically just trying to play the crowd

1701.44 --> 1707.52
like that's the target right

1704.88 --> 1708.7990000000002
but this is a darkness trick and it's

1707.52 --> 1712.08
utilized for

1708.799 --> 1714.399
yeah very overtly these days

1712.08 --> 1715.9189999999999
but people still buy into it they just

1714.399 --> 1717.52
get caught up in the fray and the

1715.919 --> 1720.5590000000002
intensity and energy in the

1717.52 --> 1722.799
and the dramatics especially the

1720.559 --> 1723.76
dramatics really it's like a movie but

1722.799 --> 1728.1589999999999
it's you

1723.76 --> 1730.32
it's you in the real world but it's not

1728.159 --> 1731.44
if you approach it like a movie and just

1730.32 --> 1734.24
become a part of it

1731.44 --> 1739.8400000000001
you don't see what's really happening

1734.24 --> 1739.84
and how you're being played

1750.84 --> 1753.84
huh

1754.159 --> 1761.279
an edge afraid of

1757.6 --> 1763.4399999999998
getting too close to the edge

1761.279 --> 1765.52
all right you mean at a at a pass and

1763.44 --> 1767.279
all that

1765.52 --> 1770.08
you don't want to drop into a ravine

1767.279 --> 1770.08
yeah i get that

1775.12 --> 1781.039
you're talking about skiing right robin

1778.84 --> 1783.36
stanley

1781.039 --> 1783.36
right

1791.6 --> 1795.84
it's become a metaphor hmm

1834.84 --> 1837.84
but

1845.44 --> 1851.8400000000001
eight what was all good to see you

1856.64 --> 1861.1200000000001
ah in the room in the rhythm hey that's

1859.12 --> 1864.6399999999999
a good question

1861.12 --> 1867.279
i like those types of questions right

1864.64 --> 1868.159
as time goes on we continue to learn

1867.279 --> 1869.679
more

1868.159 --> 1873.1200000000001
do you think the flat earth movement

1869.679 --> 1873.1200000000001
will grow or get smaller

1874.0 --> 1879.84
i think that

1881.12 --> 1890.0
i think that the flat earth has

1884.559 --> 1890.0
surpassed peak growth for some time

1890.24 --> 1896.96
so it will still grow but slowly because

1893.279 --> 1899.279
this is why there's two factors at play

1896.96 --> 1902.32
for flat earth the one

1899.279 --> 1903.039
factor is the flat earthers that are

1902.32 --> 1904.6399999999999
like

1903.039 --> 1907.12
kind of like what i'm part of too

1904.64 --> 1909.279
constantly talking about flat earth

1907.12 --> 1911.1999999999998
trying to teach about flat earth or

1909.279 --> 1912.64
getting people's face and just like hey

1911.2 --> 1916.72
did you know the earth is flat

1912.64 --> 1921.8400000000001
right all these the the actors the

1916.72 --> 1921.84
uh what's the right word

1924.32 --> 1929.6789999999999
executors now the the activists right

1928.32 --> 1932.1589999999999
it's basically the

1929.679 --> 1932.88
the the ones that are actively onto flat

1932.159 --> 1936.7990000000002
earth

1932.88 --> 1938.88
right so this thing like a lot of people

1936.799 --> 1940.399
can do some of that to a certain degree

1938.88 --> 1942.0800000000002
but to really

1940.399 --> 1943.9189999999999
stick to that and make it your thing

1942.08 --> 1947.12
it's kind of difficult

1943.919 --> 1950.3990000000001
so there's only so many people

1947.12 --> 1952.2399999999998
around the world and it can go

1950.399 --> 1954.08
pretty much anywhere you know there's a

1952.24 --> 1954.3990000000001
lot of flat earth activists out there

1954.08 --> 1956.6399999999999
that

1954.399 --> 1959.12
we've never heard of in other countries

1956.64 --> 1961.1200000000001
probably almost every country

1959.12 --> 1962.799
has a couple of flat earthers here and

1961.12 --> 1965.84
there

1962.799 --> 1966.72
like activists but maybe depending on

1965.84 --> 1968.08
their country

1966.72 --> 1970.32
and the culture they have to be a little

1968.08 --> 1971.6
bit more careful or they're just like oh

1970.32 --> 1975.4399999999998
it's so good

1971.6 --> 1978.799
everybody's on with this right because

1975.44 --> 1983.1200000000001
the other group besides the activists is

1978.799 --> 1985.6
the general public now they can

1983.12 --> 1987.5189999999998
be okay with flat earth and not

1985.6 --> 1989.6
necessarily

1987.519 --> 1991.84
want to constantly know and learn about

1989.6 --> 1995.36
it they'll just be like yeah yeah

1991.84 --> 1998.9599999999998
sure yeah i get it like government lies

1995.36 --> 2002.84
media lies so yeah this makes sense

1998.96 --> 2005.519
and yeah okay i guess the earth is flat

2002.84 --> 2007.9189999999999
right now

2005.519 --> 2009.76
those people are not super overt

2007.919 --> 2012.72
constantly talking about it and they'll

2009.76 --> 2014.8799999999999
probably not bring it up

2012.72 --> 2017.519
because that'll cause some confrontation

2014.88 --> 2018.72
maybe or maybe at some point yeah when

2017.519 --> 2020.72
the atmosphere is right

2018.72 --> 2022.08
they can't just have nice discussions

2020.72 --> 2023.1200000000001
with others and then they'll just kind

2022.08 --> 2025.6
of forget about it

2023.12 --> 2027.12
again not forget that the earth is flat

2025.6 --> 2029.279
but just

2027.12 --> 2031.039
it's not doesn't have that much weight

2029.279 --> 2032.0
even if the other disagree because they

2031.039 --> 2034.8799999999999
just don't care that

2032.0 --> 2036.88
much but they might know it's flat right

2034.88 --> 2040.0800000000002
well these

2036.88 --> 2042.3200000000002
this group these people that one is

2040.08 --> 2045.6789999999999
likely to grow

2042.32 --> 2046.0
a lot but you can't really see it it's

2045.679 --> 2048.7200000000003
just

2046.0 --> 2051.359
the natural effect of waking up in the

2048.72 --> 2054.72
right moment being ready to

2051.359 --> 2057.2799999999997
snap out of that dream and embrace the

2054.72 --> 2061.839
new world

2057.28 --> 2061.8390000000004
literally the flat earth

2063.28 --> 2068.079
so the amount of activists are not going

2066.56 --> 2070.24
to particularly grow although

2068.079 --> 2072.48
unfortunately the amount of counter

2070.24 --> 2075.839
activists

2072.48 --> 2078.079
just like a counter media in a way

2075.839 --> 2079.7599999999998
that is likely to grow because there's

2078.079 --> 2081.8390000000004
just so much money

2079.76 --> 2083.2000000000003
and so many people that want money and

2081.839 --> 2085.2799999999997
they just oh let's

2083.2 --> 2086.56
do this they want attention they want

2085.28 --> 2088.159
money oh

2086.56 --> 2090.0789999999997
well the ball is very popular in the

2088.159 --> 2092.8
stupid flat earthers yeah yeah

2090.079 --> 2094.32
unfortunately that will keep expanding

2092.8 --> 2097.8390000000004
but then again

2094.32 --> 2100.88
and they don't even realize it is that

2097.839 --> 2104.0789999999997
for the activists

2100.88 --> 2106.48
that just reaffirms that

2104.079 --> 2109.119
they are a threat and that they need to

2106.48 --> 2109.119
keep going

2109.2 --> 2114.64
because the counter ballers

2112.24 --> 2116.0789999999997
are expanding they're yeah they're very

2114.64 --> 2119.2799999999997
popular they're made very

2116.079 --> 2120.0
popular they have so right there's a lot

2119.28 --> 2122.8
of people

2120.0 --> 2124.16
at the same time besides the people on

2122.8 --> 2127.44
the flatter side

2124.16 --> 2130.3199999999997
the regulars that keep it silent

2127.44 --> 2130.88
there's also probably gonna pop up more

2130.32 --> 2132.96
and more

2130.88 --> 2134.88
people that are really holding on to

2132.96 --> 2138.2400000000002
that ball and they're real like social

2134.88 --> 2145.839
justice warrior ballers

2138.24 --> 2145.839
it's like bald justice warriors

2147.599 --> 2151.52
right there's going to be some of them

2149.76 --> 2154.48
and who knows maybe it is

2151.52 --> 2155.7599999999998
even social justice or not no i don't

2154.48 --> 2157.599
know there are probably some social

2155.76 --> 2159.119
justice warriors that are very much onto

2157.599 --> 2163.3590000000004
flat earth

2159.119 --> 2167.28
that know like yeah so

2163.359 --> 2167.2799999999997
despite their other traits

2168.16 --> 2174.72
but yeah as more

2172.24 --> 2176.4799999999996
regular calm flat earthers that don't

2174.72 --> 2180.24
really talk about it as that group

2176.48 --> 2182.56
expands there will also be more annoying

2180.24 --> 2185.04
ball justice warriors popping up and and

2182.56 --> 2188.88
i mean in face-to-face situations

2185.04 --> 2190.56
that may occur right on the internet

2188.88 --> 2192.48
that's a separate thing that's just the

2190.56 --> 2193.2799999999997
troll they are there they're always

2192.48 --> 2196.48
going to be there

2193.28 --> 2198.6400000000003
and there is financial incentive that

2196.48 --> 2202.96
group is definitely going to

2198.64 --> 2205.92
grow and i probably think outgrow

2202.96 --> 2206.48
the flat earthers because we're just

2205.92 --> 2209.44
gonna

2206.48 --> 2212.32
keep on going we're gonna learn the

2209.44 --> 2215.52
concentration the purity of our material

2212.32 --> 2218.4
will improve

2215.52 --> 2219.92
but there's only so many people that are

2218.4 --> 2223.2000000000003
going to really

2219.92 --> 2225.6800000000003
effectively join us

2223.2 --> 2227.52
because it's it's difficult to do that

2225.68 --> 2229.2
it requires a lot of dedication

2227.52 --> 2231.119
and most people just don't have the time

2229.2 --> 2234.24
and the energy for that

2231.119 --> 2238.1600000000003
it requires you almost to have no life

2234.24 --> 2240.4799999999996
hey oh here's arwyn yeah i know

2238.16 --> 2240.48
right

2241.359 --> 2245.119
and if you do manage to do it with a

2243.839 --> 2249.7599999999998
life that's

2245.119 --> 2252.0
that's pretty that's that's pretty cool

2249.76 --> 2253.8390000000004
not saying that you you cannot have a

2252.0 --> 2256.24
life and do flat earth

2253.839 --> 2257.839
activism that's not true hey there's

2256.24 --> 2259.68
entire families that just

2257.839 --> 2261.839
go out as a family and do that sort of

2259.68 --> 2266.72
thing even

2261.839 --> 2266.72
right but

2267.359 --> 2272.48
yeah that's that's my forecast of where

2269.599 --> 2272.48
this is all going

2280.24 --> 2286.7999999999997
the future of man won't have time to

2282.56 --> 2286.7999999999997
ponder on such philosophical concepts

2287.599 --> 2290.2400000000002
well maybe

2291.119 --> 2298.9900000000002
but then again you can't keep it in the

2293.359 --> 2302.2
back of your mind

2298.99 --> 2302.2
[Music]

2310.839 --> 2313.839
so

2315.76 --> 2320.7200000000003
lower literally see literacy every

2318.32 --> 2323.76
decade yes

2320.72 --> 2325.359
probably right robin stanley and this is

2323.76 --> 2329.92
also the problem of

2325.359 --> 2332.4
the the overall increase in hostility of

2329.92 --> 2332.4
media

2332.56 --> 2334.7999999999997
is

2335.92 --> 2339.52
it just makes it it it kind of does

2338.4 --> 2342.64
discourage

2339.52 --> 2344.56
to read because you just don't need to

2342.64 --> 2345.1189999999997
there's so much blabbering going on why

2344.56 --> 2346.72
would you

2345.119 --> 2348.7200000000003
read anything if you can just hear

2346.72 --> 2350.48
somebody say it

2348.72 --> 2354.56
right there's so many people saying

2350.48 --> 2358.2400000000002
things now

2354.56 --> 2361.2
and there is something to that but still

2358.24 --> 2361.2
reading and writing

2364.32 --> 2367.599
i wonder like how the new generations

2366.56 --> 2371.2
will be

2367.599 --> 2375.52
with a pencil and paper because i

2371.2 --> 2379.7599999999998
am very glad that i know how to use this

2375.52 --> 2381.2
right not just for drawing for writing

2379.76 --> 2384.8
things and i have a

2381.2 --> 2385.359
decent decent quality writing like that

2384.8 --> 2390.7200000000003
it is

2385.359 --> 2393.5989999999997
readable i have my own style

2390.72 --> 2394.7999999999997
but yeah that's especially that the

2393.599 --> 2397.2000000000003
writing part

2394.8 --> 2398.079
like with handwriting how many people in

2397.2 --> 2400.3199999999997
the future

2398.079 --> 2401.92
in the these last few generations will

2400.32 --> 2405.92
be

2401.92 --> 2405.92
able to write something down with a

2408.839 --> 2412.88
pencil

2411.28 --> 2415.52
there's still going to be plenty of re

2412.88 --> 2418.56
reading material though but

2415.52 --> 2420.24
because of the haste the the

2418.56 --> 2423.68
acceleration

2420.24 --> 2426.72
of the amount of media output right

2423.68 --> 2428.24
back let's say 50 years ago and 100

2426.72 --> 2431.7599999999998
years ago

2428.24 --> 2432.56
writing you had all the time in the

2431.76 --> 2435.2000000000003
world

2432.56 --> 2437.359
there was no rush push push push oh we

2435.2 --> 2438.8799999999997
have got to put out this story before

2437.359 --> 2442.319
somebody else does it

2438.88 --> 2446.8
right it wasn't so crowded in

2442.319 --> 2450.319
the virtual media idea escape

2446.8 --> 2452.7200000000003
so people had a lot more time to very

2450.319 --> 2455.52
very carefully pick their words and

2452.72 --> 2458.8799999999997
basically strategize the writing

2455.52 --> 2462.16
and so a lot of older older writing is

2458.88 --> 2464.96
a higher quality a higher intellectual

2462.16 --> 2469.2
quality it works better to read that

2464.96 --> 2473.119
well people in the newer generations

2469.2 --> 2475.9199999999996
they've not been dosed in that like

2473.119 --> 2477.44
back in the day way back before my time

2475.92 --> 2480.2400000000002
even

2477.44 --> 2481.92
reading was for smart people you know

2480.24 --> 2484.64
why because

2481.92 --> 2486.96
it's difficult it's high it's compacted

2484.64 --> 2487.7599999999998
it's very carefully put down everything

2486.96 --> 2491.599
right

2487.76 --> 2493.119
well media nowadays it's all quick quick

2491.599 --> 2495.76
quick

2493.119 --> 2497.119
so it is not as concentrate people did

2495.76 --> 2498.96
not have as much time

2497.119 --> 2500.7200000000003
yes there's a lot of very good

2498.96 --> 2504.2400000000002
strategies of like how can you

2500.72 --> 2509.839
quickly put something down pretty good

2504.24 --> 2509.839
but the spirit behind it is rushed

2510.24 --> 2516.24
and if that's all that you're reading

2512.24 --> 2520.0789999999997
you're not getting the really compacted

2516.24 --> 2522.0
thinking and the essence of it

2520.079 --> 2523.44
because people did not have as much time

2522.0 --> 2537.839
to figure out

2523.44 --> 2537.839
how to put it down

2538.0 --> 2543.52
they won't teach critical thinking

2539.839 --> 2545.92
anymore well that's really up to

2543.52 --> 2545.92
parents

2547.76 --> 2552.3190000000004
you know if a parent teaches their own

2549.68 --> 2554.72
kid critical thinking

2552.319 --> 2555.839
then it's all right then whatever

2554.72 --> 2558.9599999999996
they're going to be

2555.839 --> 2561.92
submersed in even

2558.96 --> 2564.4
they will be able to judge and if they

2561.92 --> 2564.88
realize like yeah i can step away if

2564.4 --> 2567.28
this

2564.88 --> 2568.8
triggers me or if this is indecent or if

2567.28 --> 2570.88
it's against great whatever

2568.8 --> 2573.44
angle they're gonna as long as they have

2570.88 --> 2577.839
critical thought and that like no

2573.44 --> 2579.839
i have to decide about that

2577.839 --> 2581.44
it's not just i have to go along with

2579.839 --> 2585.52
whatever

2581.44 --> 2588.8
if as long as parents from any group

2585.52 --> 2588.8
teach their kid that

2588.96 --> 2593.119
then it's not going to be like a giant

2591.44 --> 2607.839
horde of people that are just gonna do

2593.119 --> 2607.839
whatever they're being told

2613.28 --> 2617.28
right but if you want to teach your kids

2615.28 --> 2618.5600000000004
that then you have to also be careful

2617.28 --> 2621.76
about what types of

2618.56 --> 2625.119
material media reading whatever

2621.76 --> 2628.48
wise you're going to confront them with

2625.119 --> 2628.48
because a lot of media

2628.64 --> 2635.2799999999997
and materials are

2632.079 --> 2636.319
are really like savage in ways they

2635.28 --> 2640.079
really like over

2636.319 --> 2644.0
protect to try to present

2640.079 --> 2646.319
make yeah conjure an image

2644.0 --> 2648.72
like there is no host that like

2646.319 --> 2652.24
everything is all perfect

2648.72 --> 2656.56
which it blatantly isn't in reality

2652.24 --> 2657.5989999999997
right that that makes it more difficult

2656.56 --> 2661.119
that

2657.599 --> 2662.079
binds kids if they really believe in

2661.119 --> 2664.319
that and nobody

2662.079 --> 2667.04
snaps them out of it it binds them in

2664.319 --> 2668.96
that position

2667.04 --> 2670.4
and then it will be extremely difficult

2668.96 --> 2674.0
to snap out of it again it look

2670.4 --> 2674.56
very hurtful to them if they keep stuck

2674.0 --> 2677.839
in that

2674.56 --> 2677.839
like their entire youth

2682.72 --> 2686.72
like if they use that as an escapism

2686.0 --> 2689.2
mechanism

2686.72 --> 2691.2
for example not every one every kid will

2689.2 --> 2694.72
do that and you know

2691.2 --> 2696.8799999999997
it's it was kind of a problem with me

2694.72 --> 2698.72
like i couldn't really deal with the

2696.88 --> 2700.079
harshness of the world and that not

2698.72 --> 2702.0
everything was good it was

2700.079 --> 2704.319
really painful for me and it kind of

2702.0 --> 2706.16
stayed stayed painful and people did try

2704.319 --> 2707.92
to snap me out of it

2706.16 --> 2710.8799999999997
and it just conjured up all these

2707.92 --> 2713.359
nightmares and [ __ ]

2710.88 --> 2713.359
in me

2716.24 --> 2720.0
this is all this weird effects

2724.72 --> 2728.8799999999997
right but now that i'm of course a lot

2727.119 --> 2732.0
older

2728.88 --> 2735.76
i'd like to say i'm wiser i think i

2732.0 --> 2738.319
am compared to them because back then

2735.76 --> 2740.079
the strength of the impulses were so

2738.319 --> 2743.599
strong

2740.079 --> 2745.6800000000003
that just i couldn't hold back about a

2743.599 --> 2746.0
lot of things and so i didn't have the

2745.68 --> 2749.9199999999996
room

2746.0 --> 2752.88
to basically alter my own dynamics

2749.92 --> 2754.96
that much just the impulses just

2752.88 --> 2757.92
whatever impulse comes and then i did

2754.96 --> 2757.92
learn to basically

2758.079 --> 2761.8390000000004
ignore certain impulses

2762.319 --> 2767.599
but beside that it was still the

2764.16 --> 2771.1189999999997
impulses that would drive me forth

2767.599 --> 2771.119
and not so much planning

2772.96 --> 2777.92
and i guess that i'm still kind of like

2775.68 --> 2777.9199999999996
that

2782.56 --> 2789.839
right i don't know where i'm going with

2784.079 --> 2789.8390000000004
this strain of thinking anymore

2796.88 --> 2803.119
yeah child escaping into a book that

2799.44 --> 2806.88
over vr of course

2803.119 --> 2808.6400000000003
especially like when i was a little kid

2806.88 --> 2813.6800000000003
my mother used to read

2808.64 --> 2816.56
from books like yeah tell me a story

2813.68 --> 2818.96
and man that worked it was so intense

2816.56 --> 2818.96
because

2819.839 --> 2825.2
it would just really like who

2822.88 --> 2827.119
the freak needs a tv when you got a

2825.2 --> 2830.64
holographic projector

2827.119 --> 2834.2400000000002
in your head and it'll just

2830.64 --> 2838.24
instantly visually represent to you

2834.24 --> 2841.04
in your mind what is being talked about

2838.24 --> 2841.68
that was a blast and it was a little

2841.04 --> 2845.2
harder

2841.68 --> 2847.7599999999998
reading but eventually because

2845.2 --> 2848.64
yeah the jury because i i learned to do

2847.76 --> 2853.119
that first

2848.64 --> 2853.1189999999997
so that the imager

2853.52 --> 2858.559
is very active is very trained with me

2856.319 --> 2861.599
right and what's very obvious i use it

2858.559 --> 2863.92
technically even it's like a tool

2861.599 --> 2865.52
that's what it's become but when i read

2863.92 --> 2868.0
stuff from a book

2865.52 --> 2868.64
the problem is is that the imager kind

2868.0 --> 2872.4
of

2868.64 --> 2873.2
dominates so eventually this happens a

2872.4 --> 2876.1600000000003
lot

2873.2 --> 2878.48
i turn over a couple of pages and then

2876.16 --> 2880.0789999999997
after a while i snap out of it i realize

2878.48 --> 2882.72
like whoa i haven't been reading the

2880.079 --> 2882.7200000000003
book at all

2883.359 --> 2890.0
i've been fantasizing about reading it

2887.2 --> 2890.96
and then conjuring up what i like my

2890.0 --> 2893.04
prediction it's

2890.96 --> 2900.96
very weird what can happen sometimes

2893.04 --> 2904.8
like it's just a dream thing

2900.96 --> 2909.28
right oh hey julia pavin

2904.8 --> 2913.28
paypal that's very

2909.28 --> 2915.8390000000004
very welcome i can definitely use that

2913.28 --> 2915.8390000000004
it's been a while

2924.72 --> 2930.5589999999997
oh man thank you so much

2933.04 --> 2938.0
that is awesome thank you so much julio

2935.599 --> 2938.0
pavin

2939.76 --> 2943.8390000000004
yeah that's absolutely going to help me

2945.599 --> 2957.839
great relief

2962.72 --> 2966.24
because i was still doing good for a

2964.319 --> 2969.44
while financially but it's

2966.24 --> 2970.319
also because of i don't know some crypto

2969.44 --> 2973.52
things that i

2970.319 --> 2976.5589999999997
tried out like to try to cash out and

2973.52 --> 2979.52
that kind of worked out so

2976.559 --> 2982.1600000000003
i've managed to kind of like yeah able

2979.52 --> 2984.72
to get through without

2982.16 --> 2987.1189999999997
like getting in more debt or anything

2984.72 --> 2988.16
but yeah i was just barely holding on so

2987.119 --> 2999.839
thank you so much

2988.16 --> 2999.839
this is very helpful

3008.48 --> 3013.839
[Music]

3010.839 --> 3013.839
cheers

3014.5 --> 3017.699
[Music]

3028.559 --> 3033.52
a regulation of the freedom of religion

3038.839 --> 3041.839
what

3045.599 --> 3055.839
i i don't know about that

3060.64 --> 3064.7999999999997
hmm i know someone who has no mind's eye

3062.96 --> 3066.8
thus reading is not an imaginative

3064.8 --> 3069.44
journey for them

3066.8 --> 3070.319
very interesting oh that sounds that

3069.44 --> 3075.2000000000003
sounds really

3070.319 --> 3082.96
sad i wonder though

3075.2 --> 3085.52
i wonder though if it it like

3082.96 --> 3088.4
i wonder when like the the gate closes

3085.52 --> 3093.119
when you can still develop that

3088.4 --> 3093.119
because it is something that i

3093.28 --> 3099.119
yeah it's like your parents like kind of

3095.359 --> 3099.119
can't conjure it it's just like

3100.96 --> 3105.119
i don't know maybe i was just born with

3108.839 --> 3114.0
it

3111.68 --> 3116.5589999999997
but it's it sounds weird because if you

3114.0 --> 3120.88
can't imagine

3116.559 --> 3123.3590000000004
then how does almost anything

3120.88 --> 3124.0
that somebody says make any contextual

3123.359 --> 3126.24
sense

3124.0 --> 3127.04
like you have to put it in a framework

3126.24 --> 3129.68
it's like

3127.04 --> 3132.16
you're being dropped a sentence in

3129.68 --> 3134.5589999999997
another sentence and another sentence

3132.16 --> 3136.72
it's supposed to mean something so you

3134.559 --> 3139.44
have to put it together

3136.72 --> 3141.68
as you go to figure out what does it

3139.44 --> 3141.68
mean

3142.48 --> 3147.44
that's that's imaging right that

3150.16 --> 3156.0
like maybe

3153.68 --> 3156.72
it's not just very extensive with some

3156.0 --> 3158.48
people but

3156.72 --> 3160.16
you have to have some of that because

3158.48 --> 3162.64
otherwise you're not gonna understand

3160.16 --> 3162.64
anything

3164.24 --> 3168.0789999999997
you're not gonna understand complicated

3178.839 --> 3181.839
reason

3189.52 --> 3195.839
can't see a memory in his head oh

3241.99 --> 3245.04
[Music]

3248.839 --> 3251.839
right

3252.24 --> 3265.839
autism causes loss of such inner senses

3256.64 --> 3265.839
really i disagree

3273.44 --> 3281.76
like no i i know what what

3279.52 --> 3284.799
well it i guess yeah if it's going to be

3281.76 --> 3287.0400000000004
like vaccine damage

3284.799 --> 3290.72
it all depends on like how you really

3287.04 --> 3290.72
define autism at this point

3291.52 --> 3296.64
because i've said to be touched by the

3294.64 --> 3299.44
autistic spectrum slightly it's

3296.64 --> 3300.0789999999997
some people say that about me but i have

3299.44 --> 3303.68
like this

3300.079 --> 3305.599
mighty mighty imaging system

3303.68 --> 3307.04
it is really strong i'm really happy

3305.599 --> 3311.119
with it i

3307.04 --> 3312.799
defended against the world literally

3311.119 --> 3315.599
i know there might be some people even

3312.799 --> 3315.599
jealous of it

3316.16 --> 3322.799
trust me it's not all nice no

3319.28 --> 3326.799
it's good and the bad so

3322.799 --> 3326.799
ignorance can be bliss trust me

3332.799 --> 3336.559
yeah especially because i do combine it

3335.44 --> 3339.599
with empathy

3336.559 --> 3341.76
you know i have empathy skills as well

3339.599 --> 3343.52
and i combine my imaging system with

3341.76 --> 3345.92
empathy well

3343.52 --> 3347.28
that's almost like a telepathic

3345.92 --> 3351.52
experience in a way it's an

3347.28 --> 3356.3190000000004
indirect telepathy it's very weird

3351.52 --> 3362.0
it's like how certain types of series

3356.319 --> 3365.44
basically um

3362.0 --> 3368.16
show like telepathy works like in the

3365.44 --> 3369.2000000000003
in their minds right you have a lot of

3368.16 --> 3370.64
scenes in

3369.2 --> 3373.1189999999997
series and movies where there's

3370.64 --> 3374.16
telepathy and they take it serious it's

3373.119 --> 3377.52
like yeah

3374.16 --> 3381.52
well in ways

3377.52 --> 3385.2
i have devised a mechanism in myself

3381.52 --> 3386.16
trained that where it gets very close to

3385.2 --> 3388.64
that

3386.16 --> 3390.24
but it but i can be off sometimes but

3388.64 --> 3394.96
then i can quickly find out

3390.24 --> 3394.9599999999996
how i was off and correct it

3397.92 --> 3402.319
this is almost like reversed engineered

3400.64 --> 3404.0789999999997
telepathy

3402.319 --> 3405.92
kind of i guess it kind of you could

3404.079 --> 3408.319
consider it like that

3405.92 --> 3410.559
but it requires the imagination to be

3408.319 --> 3410.5589999999997
very

3413.52 --> 3420.72
open it's like

3417.2 --> 3423.4399999999996
raw output display

3420.72 --> 3425.4399999999996
and that can bring things in your mind

3423.44 --> 3429.44
that you don't want

3425.44 --> 3432.559
right because you're literally trying to

3429.44 --> 3433.119
get it as is this is very risky it's

3432.559 --> 3436.0
like

3433.119 --> 3436.6400000000003
an extreme form of trust that you have

3436.0 --> 3447.839
to apply

3436.64 --> 3447.839
otherwise you're not going to get it

3468.0 --> 3471.119
imagery vision

3471.52 --> 3476.72
right the imagination it's the original

3473.92 --> 3481.28
imagination but your imagination is just

3476.72 --> 3481.2799999999997
it's a box of tools virtually

3481.76 --> 3487.119
it's like a box of tools and yeah

3485.2 --> 3488.799
i've had a lot of like oh encourage

3487.119 --> 3493.04
imagination guess what

3488.799 --> 3494.799
nasa encourages a lot of imagination too

3493.04 --> 3496.4
and i used to think they were freaking

3494.799 --> 3497.7599999999998
awesome because of it that's how it

3496.4 --> 3499.28
started out as a little kid that's why i

3497.76 --> 3500.4
want to become an astronaut when i was

3499.28 --> 3503.119
six

3500.4 --> 3503.839
because they were like imagination yeah

3503.119 --> 3507.119
and i was like

3503.839 --> 3508.0789999999997
oh i am the champion of imagination i

3507.119 --> 3511.359
know it

3508.079 --> 3513.28
i can imagine things that'll blow

3511.359 --> 3516.0
people's minds

3513.28 --> 3517.3590000000004
right i didn't realize what was going on

3516.0 --> 3519.599
back then

3517.359 --> 3519.5989999999997
right

3520.48 --> 3526.64
and now i realize like oh [ __ ] no

3523.92 --> 3528.2400000000002
they actually make people conjure their

3526.64 --> 3530.64
imagination

3528.24 --> 3532.16
but not necessarily give them the tools

3530.64 --> 3534.8799999999997
to distinguish

3532.16 --> 3536.0789999999997
things and learn critical thinking so

3534.88 --> 3539.2000000000003
they can then just

3536.079 --> 3541.2000000000003
make them addicted to imagination and

3539.2 --> 3543.839
then all the nasa people

3541.2 --> 3544.8799999999997
will deliver the story to imagine about

3543.839 --> 3548.16
and i

3544.88 --> 3548.7200000000003
fell in that category absolutely and i

3548.16 --> 3551.52
would be

3548.72 --> 3552.3999999999996
like oh the tv put it on oh there's some

3551.52 --> 3554.799
space

3552.4 --> 3556.4
imagery somewhere i gotta see it i gotta

3554.799 --> 3560.559
see it right now i was

3556.4 --> 3560.96
i was that kid i was very very fanatical

3560.559 --> 3565.52
like

3560.96 --> 3570.559
obsessed everything space everything

3565.52 --> 3570.559
battlestar galactica and god

3570.799 --> 3586.799
bug rogers loved all that [ __ ]

3574.559 --> 3590.1600000000003
especially the space parts

3586.799 --> 3593.44
right and i think that back then

3590.16 --> 3595.92
even my family

3593.44 --> 3597.839
who was very much into critical thinking

3595.92 --> 3600.96
very glad of that like critical thinking

3597.839 --> 3604.48
was kept at a high standard

3600.96 --> 3604.48
for my brother and for me

3604.64 --> 3608.16
they did try to snap me out of it like

3606.559 --> 3611.3590000000004
this is fantasy

3608.16 --> 3612.0789999999997
but i misunderstood maybe they didn't

3611.359 --> 3615.119
even know it

3612.079 --> 3616.079
it's just weird like i knew that yeah

3615.119 --> 3618.7200000000003
that is tv

3616.079 --> 3620.1600000000003
it's what somebody made but in my mind i

3618.72 --> 3623.7599999999998
thought like

3620.16 --> 3623.7599999999998
how real could that be

3623.92 --> 3629.839
like could that happen in reality and i

3626.559 --> 3629.8390000000004
did believe that

3633.359 --> 3639.52
but now that i look at it the way that i

3636.48 --> 3643.2
do right now it's

3639.52 --> 3646.319
it's actually more liberating in a way

3643.2 --> 3650.8799999999997
it really is because now i just

3646.319 --> 3653.2799999999997
know that the mind plays tricks on you

3650.88 --> 3655.52
and that it is inevitable that the world

3653.28 --> 3658.88
is full of this that the imagination

3655.52 --> 3660.96
is well

3658.88 --> 3662.559
constantly being used against us we're

3660.96 --> 3665.119
being trained

3662.559 --> 3665.119
for that

3667.359 --> 3670.5589999999997
but we can do something against it using

3669.52 --> 3672.559
critical thinking

3670.559 --> 3676.079
and then you can actually train your

3672.559 --> 3679.44
imagination if you have some

3676.079 --> 3684.4
to become well scientific

3679.44 --> 3687.28
and getting real not just yeah general

3684.4 --> 3690.64
whatever talk supposedly scientific and

3687.28 --> 3690.6400000000003
it's not scientific at all

3691.28 --> 3696.3190000000004
right you can get into real physics use

3693.92 --> 3699.04
that same imagination

3696.319 --> 3700.88
to figure things out and to analyze

3699.04 --> 3704.4
things much better and then apply

3700.88 --> 3712.1600000000003
knowledge to that imagination

3704.4 --> 3715.039
figuring things out

3712.16 --> 3716.96
hmm encroach my daughter's imagination

3715.039 --> 3717.92
in a spiritual sense and she's just have

3716.96 --> 3727.839
on

3717.92 --> 3727.839
oh that's heavy stuff

3728.16 --> 3734.319
yeah in a spiritual sense i i too was

3731.359 --> 3734.319
kind of a savant

3738.88 --> 3745.2000000000003
i think pretty much most of my

3742.319 --> 3746.96
really young days up until probably up

3745.2 --> 3749.2799999999997
until i got space addicted

3746.96 --> 3751.68
and tv and all that in computer games

3749.28 --> 3751.6800000000003
and that

3751.839 --> 3755.839
that pulled me in

3758.96 --> 3762.559
and then eventually i wanted to be more

3761.2 --> 3769.839
atheist and all that

3762.559 --> 3769.8390000000004
i wanted to get more real how ironic

3794.839 --> 3798.16
hmm

3796.559 --> 3800.559
ah if you don't exist there is no

3798.16 --> 3802.5589999999997
reality well reality

3800.559 --> 3805.2000000000003
by the nature of the word is a

3802.559 --> 3805.2000000000003
perspective

3807.92 --> 3811.839
no consciousness no reality

3825.76 --> 3829.92
or gaining wisdom i think it works

3828.079 --> 3832.799
different

3829.92 --> 3834.16
people that don't have mind vision they

3832.799 --> 3836.839
don't just react to

3834.16 --> 3839.839
environmental stimuli they react to

3836.839 --> 3839.839
planning

3841.039 --> 3844.6400000000003
it's like they figure out like okay what

3843.68 --> 3847.7599999999998
is the

3844.64 --> 3851.2
order of what is said

3847.76 --> 3851.2000000000003
how do people respond

3851.599 --> 3855.039
so what does that mean

3859.28 --> 3861.6800000000003
i think

3864.0 --> 3870.48
they might be i don't know like

3867.68 --> 3872.68
they might just have like an a a

3870.48 --> 3881.839
planning system that just doesn't apply

3872.68 --> 3881.839
visualization in any form

3882.079 --> 3886.079
if they have that you know if they don't

3884.079 --> 3895.8390000000004
have that then yes it's just going to be

3886.079 --> 3895.8390000000004
a bunch of drones responding to stimuli

3897.87 --> 3901.06
[Music]

3901.44 --> 3907.119
right by the way i when it comes to

3904.48 --> 3909.839
psychological mechanism

3907.119 --> 3911.6800000000003
since like the inner voice had been

3909.839 --> 3912.72
discussed on the flat earth debates and

3911.68 --> 3914.96
such

3912.72 --> 3918.799
like the inner voice is something

3914.96 --> 3918.799
different from the imagination

3920.079 --> 3924.7200000000003
in the the inner voice is not

3922.4 --> 3927.52
visualizing as much

3924.72 --> 3928.799
but you can use the visualization

3927.52 --> 3936.48
mechanism

3928.799 --> 3940.559
but it's like a pre system to that

3936.48 --> 3943.839
so yeah you can not have a visualization

3940.559 --> 3951.8390000000004
mechanism and then it's more just

3943.839 --> 3951.839
auditory imagination anyway

3952.72 --> 3959.7599999999998
like i have both auditory and visual

3957.68 --> 3962.839
but they usually go their own routes

3959.76 --> 3965.44
like they have different types of

3962.839 --> 3967.2
programs it sounds weird right but they

3965.44 --> 3969.359
have different ways of conducting

3967.2 --> 3972.0
themselves in the grand scheme of my

3969.359 --> 3972.0
consciousness

3972.24 --> 3976.64
so it's like two things that because

3974.64 --> 3978.0
they are kind of like compartmentalized

3976.64 --> 3980.24
separately functioning they

3978.0 --> 3983.68
can also do separate things at the same

3980.24 --> 3983.68
time i can observe something

3983.92 --> 3989.119
and listen to something else but by the

3987.359 --> 3989.839
way with the listening i can listen to

3989.119 --> 3992.96
several

3989.839 --> 3995.839
different things at the same time

3992.96 --> 3996.7200000000003
it's really weird it's like catching the

3995.839 --> 3999.2
gist of what

3996.72 --> 4002.319
say like three different groups of

3999.2 --> 4002.319
people are talking about

4004.839 --> 4009.44
simultaneously

4007.28 --> 4011.52
but that's all the auditory you don't

4009.44 --> 4013.039
you don't visually you don't engage in

4011.52 --> 4016.319
visualization

4013.039 --> 4020.96
when that happens because that binds

4016.319 --> 4023.52
yeah that makes it impossible

4020.96 --> 4025.839
unless you basically zoom in on this

4023.52 --> 4029.44
particular conversation

4025.839 --> 4032.24
within it then the other plots out

4029.44 --> 4034.079
and then you i at least can apply

4032.24 --> 4049.839
visualization to really get

4034.079 --> 4049.8390000000004
into the depths of what they're saying

4050.48 --> 4063.839
that's the construct memory differently

4052.559 --> 4063.8390000000004
that's weird

4087.28 --> 4104.55
who do you mean day they are the ones

4090.559 --> 4108.27
who are lost what

4104.55 --> 4108.27
[Music]

4111.81 --> 4117.309
[Music]

4131.92 --> 4136.799
hmm interesting robin stanley

4144.839 --> 4147.839
hmm

4148.719 --> 4153.199
like well if we'd have to reconstruct

4151.6 --> 4155.4400000000005
memory

4153.199 --> 4156.719
differently then it only makes sense

4155.44 --> 4159.839
that their memory is

4156.719 --> 4162.56
very auditory they can massively

4159.839 --> 4162.5599999999995
memorize

4165.679 --> 4175.839
that it happened through it being said

4170.08 --> 4175.839
or read

4177.92 --> 4182.96
i don't know did you ask

4184.56 --> 4189.839000000001
they could describe it he

4205.84 --> 4213.92
huh okay they live de la fila elvenar

4211.76 --> 4215.76
down syndrome people have plenty of

4213.92 --> 4217.6
emotional intelligence empathy

4215.76 --> 4220.08
extrasensory perception but develop

4217.6 --> 4225.120000000001
dementia from early age

4220.08 --> 4227.36
why do they develop that is there any

4225.12 --> 4230.96
biological reason for that or could it

4227.36 --> 4234.08
be psychological reason you know if

4230.96 --> 4236.08
if you were really that emotionally and

4234.08 --> 4238.719
empathetical

4236.08 --> 4239.84
then the world if you would figure that

4238.719 --> 4243.12
out

4239.84 --> 4246.400000000001
how how crazy and dark the world is

4243.12 --> 4248.08
maybe they would want to just forget

4246.4 --> 4249.199
about it and if you want to forget about

4248.08 --> 4253.199
it so much then

4249.199 --> 4256.719
maybe dementia is the result of it

4253.199 --> 4256.719
maybe it's just the overload

4256.96 --> 4263.92
of the reality that causes that dementia

4260.159 --> 4263.92
i don't know i'm just i'm guessing

4270.88 --> 4273.84
hereditary

4276.56 --> 4287.84
i don't know

4291.6 --> 4301.84
what julio pavin i didn't know you were

4294.56 --> 4301.84
a chemist

4312.84 --> 4315.84
uh

4326.84 --> 4333.12
so

4328.64 --> 4333.12
yes de la fina elfinor i know

4340.88 --> 4348.7300000000005
i'm just asking a more specific cause

4344.719 --> 4351.78
of this dementia that you claim they

4348.73 --> 4351.78
[Music]

4354.84 --> 4357.84
get

4370.31 --> 4373.56
[Music]

4398.0 --> 4404.08
so i take it you don't know for sure de

4401.04 --> 4404.08
la fila elfinor

4405.23 --> 4410.159
[Music]

4406.96 --> 4411.44
right cause unknown i thought so well

4410.159 --> 4414.0
i'm just

4411.44 --> 4416.96
theorizing here for a second and

4414.0 --> 4419.92
basically go by okay

4416.96 --> 4419.92
if their entire

4420.4 --> 4423.679
arrangement of their consciousness is

4423.199 --> 4427.199
different

4423.679 --> 4431.28
and they're very empathic

4427.199 --> 4434.799999999999
right then maybe that dementia is not

4431.28 --> 4435.199
like a standard biological process like

4434.8 --> 4437.679
oh

4435.199 --> 4438.239
let's just say because the genetics are

4437.679 --> 4441.4400000000005
wrong

4438.239 --> 4442.08
or something a certain protein is

4441.44 --> 4444.96
attacked

4442.08 --> 4447.199
over time and then eventually you become

4444.96 --> 4448.0
basically medically demented because of

4447.199 --> 4449.919999999999
that process

4448.0 --> 4454.8
right that would be a medical reason

4449.92 --> 4457.92
well maybe they get demented because

4454.8 --> 4460.96
they turn it off

4457.92 --> 4463.1990000000005
because they can't handle

4460.96 --> 4465.12
they can't face something in reality

4463.199 --> 4469.839999999999
maybe it's that

4465.12 --> 4472.4
you know i don't know

4469.84 --> 4472.400000000001
i wonder

4479.04 --> 4484.0
like do they all have that or are they

4482.239 --> 4486.639999999999
pretty sure they're like down syndrome

4484.0 --> 4489.28
people that are still pretty

4486.64 --> 4491.12
pretty smart and like very passionate

4489.28 --> 4493.04
and driven and have found a place and

4491.12 --> 4496.88
have even respect

4493.04 --> 4500.159
do they get demanded as well

4496.88 --> 4503.04
because if if so then

4500.159 --> 4504.639999999999
it would be reasonable to say okay maybe

4503.04 --> 4508.4
there is something

4504.64 --> 4510.88
a physical reason biochemistry

4508.4 --> 4512.0
reason as to why that happens but

4510.88 --> 4514.719
otherwise i would say

4512.0 --> 4516.239
it's rather because of spiritual

4514.719 --> 4519.04
situations

4516.239 --> 4519.919999999999
that they just become demented because

4519.04 --> 4525.6
they

4519.92 --> 4527.679
can't handle the reality anymore

4525.6 --> 4529.04
because it's so harsh and manipulative

4527.679 --> 4539.84
and and that's

4529.04 --> 4539.84
not how they are right

4545.6 --> 4553.84
life expectancy around 50 hmm

4572.49 --> 4575.7699999999995
[Music]

4578.47 --> 4585.68
[Music]

4592.56 --> 4595.84
all right

4596.4 --> 4601.12
but yeah personally i i don't know

4599.44 --> 4604.96
anybody like in a family

4601.12 --> 4606.719
or a direct sense that have

4604.96 --> 4608.08
down syndrome people in them so they're

4606.719 --> 4612.719
not really a part of my life

4608.08 --> 4615.28
but i have met or well bumped into

4612.719 --> 4617.04
a couple and i they always really stood

4615.28 --> 4619.28
out not because of their looks

4617.04 --> 4621.6
necessarily although yeah that did start

4619.28 --> 4625.5199999999995
out at first of course the very first

4621.6 --> 4625.52
confrontation this little kid

4625.76 --> 4629.92
but their energy to me is always so it

4628.88 --> 4634.2390000000005
stands out like

4629.92 --> 4635.1990000000005
enormously like they have a different

4634.239 --> 4638.0
energy and it

4635.199 --> 4639.678999999999
really stands out like how they feel

4638.0 --> 4640.4
like if they feel good it's like they

4639.679 --> 4643.92
have this

4640.4 --> 4647.04
lamp of energy around them they feel bad

4643.92 --> 4651.84
then it's like things feel like there's

4647.04 --> 4651.84
something wrong here

4653.12 --> 4665.84
and they're also very physically strong

4656.719 --> 4665.84
i heard that too never tested it though

4666.08 --> 4669.5199999999995
hey hello shadow

4674.64 --> 4679.84
oh and seeking star wars

4716.8 --> 4722.719
yeah i think i'm giving you a wrench

4720.32 --> 4725.12
been around for a while you have good

4722.719 --> 4725.12
input

4726.8 --> 4735.84
and then i feel like ophener

4742.4 --> 4745.599999999999
watching conspiracy theory movie with

4744.8 --> 4749.6
mel gibson

4745.6 --> 4763.84
oh yeah that's a special one

4749.6 --> 4763.84
yeah it's very intense

4764.21 --> 4769.179
[Music]

4774.84 --> 4777.84
so

4802.84 --> 4805.84
so

4817.6 --> 4833.84
predictions for 2021 oh god

4834.56 --> 4836.88
ah

4845.04 --> 4851.36
social and economic

4848.239 --> 4853.839999999999
well i think that in 2021 like

4851.36 --> 4854.639
the real damage of the corona measures

4853.84 --> 4858.32
is become

4854.639 --> 4861.28
it will become so blatant

4858.32 --> 4863.44
that it's going to push something over

4861.28 --> 4866.4
the edge

4863.44 --> 4867.36
i don't know when that's gonna happen

4866.4 --> 4870.879999999999
but i think that

4867.36 --> 4870.88
probably after this year

4871.92 --> 4877.1990000000005
like most of the corona situation is

4874.32 --> 4877.199
going to stop

4880.159 --> 4886.32
so maybe this year i hope like

4883.28 --> 4886.8
it doesn't like how it's rolled out now

4886.32 --> 4890.96
it's like

4886.8 --> 4890.96
it's going to last forever but it's like

4891.679 --> 4897.1990000000005
people are not taking it they're really

4894.639 --> 4897.1990000000005
done with it

4898.48 --> 4902.718999999999
and there's people doubling down on

4900.4 --> 4905.599999999999
power or cocking and all that

4902.719 --> 4908.08
but yeah that's just because some people

4905.6 --> 4908.08
do that

4908.4 --> 4919.199
it's not gonna work out

4917.44 --> 4922.48
so maybe this is the year where

4919.199 --> 4925.839999999999
basically the conspiracy

4922.48 --> 4925.839999999999
will be going too far

4927.12 --> 4931.84
it will push it too much

4935.679 --> 4940.32
they the media the yeah the conspirators

4938.639 --> 4945.84
the mechanism the

4940.32 --> 4945.84
new world order

4950.159 --> 4953.92
also because if there's going to be like

4952.56 --> 4958.080000000001
new events

4953.92 --> 4960.8
like i don't know like illegal wars

4958.08 --> 4963.12
or some kind of stupid strike or some

4960.8 --> 4964.56
toppling of a dictator or whatever if

4963.12 --> 4967.44
any of that is going to happen it's

4964.56 --> 4970.8
going to be different

4967.44 --> 4974.32
because say a decade ago even

4970.8 --> 4976.56
and before 9 11 like people did not

4974.32 --> 4978.4
know how to compose they didn't know

4976.56 --> 4980.719
what it actually meant they would go

4978.4 --> 4984.08
with the program

4980.719 --> 4984.08
it's a different world today

4984.48 --> 4991.04
like there's now multi

4987.52 --> 4991.92
generations of people that kind of have

4991.04 --> 4994.48
grown up

4991.92 --> 4996.08
and like figured out like you have to

4994.48 --> 4997.919999999999
learn you ha there's psychological

4996.08 --> 5001.04
warfare going on

4997.92 --> 5001.88
there is a public consciousness that

5001.04 --> 5005.6
there is

5001.88 --> 5008.8
psychological warfare going on

5005.6 --> 5011.120000000001
top down so

5008.8 --> 5012.96
whatever is going to unroll as the next

5011.12 --> 5018.08
step of the plan

5012.96 --> 5018.08
right whatever the new world order moves

5018.719 --> 5022.159
i think that's going to be different

5025.44 --> 5030.5599999999995
i think there may be more palpable

5027.76 --> 5030.56
consequences

5030.719 --> 5032.96
like

5034.239 --> 5043.839999999999
but i don't know for sure so that's i

5036.159 --> 5043.839999999999
don't know it will that do

5059.04 --> 5063.28
also i wonder for real if this is the

5062.159 --> 5069.04
year where

5063.28 --> 5069.04
say alex jones will be taken down

5069.12 --> 5074.0
or if it if he can bypass that

5077.199 --> 5080.4
oh right and talking about which like

5079.84 --> 5083.76
might

5080.4 --> 5085.839999999999
will there be some kind of like a

5083.76 --> 5088.719
two fronts within the united states is

5085.84 --> 5088.719
it gonna be like a

5088.8 --> 5095.1990000000005
cold civil war yeah

5093.36 --> 5098.799999999999
that's a good word for it is it gonna be

5095.199 --> 5101.44
a cold civil war

5098.8 --> 5103.76
does that make sense is there going to

5101.44 --> 5106.799999999999
be a cold civil war in the united states

5103.76 --> 5113.84
like because the situation is

5106.8 --> 5113.84
getting weird

5114.32 --> 5119.679
so not a hot war oh well with

5117.36 --> 5121.04
things happening but is it more gonna be

5119.679 --> 5122.88
like a cold

5121.04 --> 5124.48
civil war with just a lot of media

5122.88 --> 5129.28
offense

5124.48 --> 5129.28
and like non-cooperation

5137.679 --> 5144.719
right we need yeah a pretty

5141.04 --> 5144.719
that's a pretty good word i agree

5145.199 --> 5152.839999999999
i might actually name this video after

5149.81 --> 5155.84
[Music]

5152.84 --> 5155.84
that

5159.53 --> 5162.849999999999
[Applause]

5167.84 --> 5169.92
you

5186.8 --> 5197.84
why don't we call this

5200.36 --> 5205.509999999999
[Applause]

5217.28 --> 5220.96
yeah i'm gonna call it the start of the

5220.159 --> 5225.839999999999
usa

5220.96 --> 5225.84
cold civil war

5256.239 --> 5260.159
in the right in the rhyme i wonder if

5258.32 --> 5263.759999999999
alex jives

5260.159 --> 5267.199
jones is going to be able to safely

5263.76 --> 5269.4400000000005
dock all legal issues i don't even know

5267.199 --> 5273.36
what kind of legal issues he all has

5269.44 --> 5273.36
you know there's been so much

5273.44 --> 5281.839999999999
stuff going on apparently

5282.4 --> 5286.96
but yeah he's now it's very predictable

5285.679 --> 5289.6
saying like oh it's all going to be

5286.96 --> 5289.6
taken down

5289.679 --> 5296.4
because of this but yeah i think that

5293.76 --> 5297.52
he also kind of said that during the

5296.4 --> 5300.159
obama era

5297.52 --> 5300.8
right gonna be taken down when he first

5300.159 --> 5305.36
got in

5300.8 --> 5305.360000000001
and he didn't he didn't get taken down

5306.84 --> 5309.84
so

5314.0 --> 5320.239
he might still just keep on going

5318.48 --> 5321.599999999999
i don't know about the legal issues

5320.239 --> 5324.5599999999995
though like

5321.6 --> 5325.120000000001
is there some real thing going on or is

5324.56 --> 5328.8
it just

5325.12 --> 5334.08
bureaucratic pushing

5328.8 --> 5334.08
to get in his way to nag him i don't

5334.84 --> 5337.84
know

5342.239 --> 5345.759999999999
nothing will be taken down or chilled

5344.0 --> 5351.84
with you and me oh don't be a

5345.76 --> 5351.84
drama queen voynich

5355.76 --> 5360.639
you'll be the mass arrests going down

5358.32 --> 5360.639
yeah

5362.84 --> 5365.84
sure

5369.199 --> 5374.96
some people are getting nervous to

5370.719 --> 5374.96
associate with him yeah well of course

5377.36 --> 5382.159
because he is kind of a grappler or kind

5380.32 --> 5393.84
he is a grappler

5382.159 --> 5393.839999999999
and he gets messy sometimes

5405.04 --> 5409.5199999999995
i technically i don't even know if alex

5407.679 --> 5411.76
knows where he's going

5409.52 --> 5412.56
but he's just doing this what he has

5411.76 --> 5414.2390000000005
been doing

5412.56 --> 5416.719
it's just following kind of the same

5414.239 --> 5416.718999999999
playbook

5417.76 --> 5421.76
the netherlands is a swamp really no it

5420.56 --> 5425.1990000000005
used to be a swamp

5421.76 --> 5426.02
and then we drained the swamp and then

5425.199 --> 5428.4
turned it into

5426.02 --> 5432.639
[Music]

5428.4 --> 5435.679
polars using dikes

5432.639 --> 5438.8
or we my far

5435.679 --> 5442.4
far away ancestors

5438.8 --> 5449.84
i didn't do that but yeah we got a

5442.4 --> 5449.839999999999
political swamp of our own

5456.719 --> 5463.84
this information setup is genius

5464.08 --> 5467.5199999999995
like who are we who are you talking

5474.84 --> 5477.84
about

5480.239 --> 5491.839999999999
right well that's what he says so he

5482.88 --> 5491.84
definitely does have his sources

5498.32 --> 5505.84
it all depends you know in a way like

5500.32 --> 5505.84
infowars like that has been used like a

5506.8 --> 5511.76
like yeah and he's even he wanted

5509.84 --> 5515.28
infowars to be part of that to be kind

5511.76 --> 5518.96
of like a public whistleblower system

5515.28 --> 5520.96
so i bet that he will have sources

5518.96 --> 5522.159
people that will remain in the shadows

5520.96 --> 5525.44
that will leak him

5522.159 --> 5528.08
the critical information and as long as

5525.44 --> 5533.839999999999
that keeps happening yeah

5528.08 --> 5533.84
he will just go on i think

5534.719 --> 5537.199
i don't know

5545.52 --> 5549.52
ah that's a very wise thing to say that

5548.159 --> 5552.159
i feel like elvenar

5549.52 --> 5554.0
eat the meat and spit out the bones from

5552.159 --> 5555.04
the likes of alex jones david i can

5554.0 --> 5558.8
trump

5555.04 --> 5562.0
god's people next time use a capital g

5558.8 --> 5575.84
don't have icons seek brotherhood

5562.0 --> 5575.84
not worship from fellow man indeed

5588.0 --> 5593.199
what people try to see plans and new

5591.28 --> 5594.88
world order when it's really just chaos

5593.199 --> 5597.678999999999
and circumstance

5594.88 --> 5597.679
are you real

5597.92 --> 5604.96
no the chaos and the circumstance are

5601.28 --> 5609.12
part of the system

5604.96 --> 5612.2390000000005
it's like a reactionary plan book

5609.12 --> 5616.32
with a specific direction and predictive

5612.239 --> 5621.12
towards where it will maneuver

5616.32 --> 5623.92
right so the playbook is out there

5621.12 --> 5625.12
and it is probably more dynamic than

5623.92 --> 5628.159
most people have

5625.12 --> 5630.719
understanding of how society works

5628.159 --> 5633.44
for real even though you might have read

5630.719 --> 5633.44
up on a lot

5637.199 --> 5643.12
but chaos and circumstance is exactly

5640.159 --> 5646.879999999999
what the new world order feeds off

5643.12 --> 5646.88
that's how it works

5646.96 --> 5651.6
yeah divide and conquer is a fundamental

5656.84 --> 5659.84
strategy

5661.28 --> 5665.5199999999995
divide and conquer no no conquer with a

5664.639 --> 5673.36
q

5665.52 --> 5687.84
not conquer

5673.36 --> 5687.839999999999
that's funny now

5692.56 --> 5697.04
okay that's a very hippie-ish question

5695.119 --> 5700.08
there steamy traveler

5697.04 --> 5702.4
do you think artists create art painting

5700.08 --> 5703.36
music etc or do they simply reveal what

5702.4 --> 5707.36
already exists

5703.36 --> 5707.36
that's such an artist thing to say

5707.679 --> 5710.639
now i think that

5711.36 --> 5715.44
what happens is they use their

5713.639 --> 5718.96
visualization and then

5715.44 --> 5721.759999999999
that's yeah they visualize or it

5718.96 --> 5723.84
it hits them the visual it ingrains them

5721.76 --> 5726.0
they know how to hold on and then they

5723.84 --> 5726.88
express it and then it might alter a

5726.0 --> 5743.84
little

5726.88 --> 5743.84
so no they definitely created

5768.84 --> 5771.84
hmm

5775.52 --> 5782.400000000001
concur is a face between

5779.28 --> 5785.84
conquering and conquest that's that's

5782.4 --> 5785.839999999999
very creative of you

5787.84 --> 5799.84
not gonna go with it though

5838.84 --> 5841.84
so

5843.36 --> 5845.599999999999
right

5848.48 --> 5851.678999999999
cutting hand yeah it's a complicated one

5851.28 --> 5853.599999999999
the

5851.679 --> 5855.76
did i feel an elf no that's why i'm not

5853.6 --> 5858.4800000000005
just reading it out right away

5855.76 --> 5860.159000000001
you say there is a definitely a guiding

5858.48 --> 5862.159
hand in this world

5860.159 --> 5868.08
its currency is money and lust for

5862.159 --> 5871.599999999999
existence and fallacy away from god

5868.08 --> 5874.239
is that the guiding yeah it's

5871.6 --> 5875.4400000000005
is is it a guiding hand i don't think so

5874.239 --> 5880.239
i think it is just

5875.44 --> 5883.119
the opportunity it's the quickness

5880.239 --> 5883.839999999999
because money make things quick makes

5883.119 --> 5886.159
you

5883.84 --> 5890.2390000000005
money is a quick reward it can present

5886.159 --> 5890.239
you with a very quick reward right

5890.4 --> 5895.839999999999
almost instantly you don't have to

5892.56 --> 5899.280000000001
physically work towards

5895.84 --> 5901.6
so it is the quick reward

5899.28 --> 5903.119
that is the fallacy away from god in

5901.6 --> 5905.1990000000005
reality

5903.119 --> 5907.5199999999995
it's taking your rewards when you

5905.199 --> 5911.839999999999
haven't actually earned it

5907.52 --> 5911.84
like spiritually earned it

5918.48 --> 5922.159
but yeah that's up to the person like

5921.119 --> 5925.839999999999
because you can

5922.159 --> 5925.839999999999
does that mean you will

5926.88 --> 5931.36
i still see there there is always a

5929.04 --> 5931.36
choice

5932.4 --> 5935.92
it's when you delude yourself into

5934.159 --> 5939.839999999999
thinking that there is no choice

5935.92 --> 5939.84
that you make the other choice

5959.76 --> 5963.76
all right yeah that's a that's a really

5961.76 --> 5966.56
good one that i feel the elephant or

5963.76 --> 5970.400000000001
satan is the guiding hand to clarify

5966.56 --> 5974.159000000001
to reveal the difference the contrast

5970.4 --> 5974.159
god inside is the guiding voice

5978.56 --> 5983.04
right and it's also like that like

5980.719 --> 5985.76
getting a quick reward

5983.04 --> 5988.96
does not build your character it does

5985.76 --> 5988.96
not actually help you

5993.199 --> 5997.599999999999
but building towards it that is the

5996.8 --> 6000.159000000001
reward

5997.6 --> 6001.360000000001
the building towards something is the

6000.159 --> 6004.638999999999
reward

6001.36 --> 6006.639
it's not the reward the world itself is

6004.639 --> 6010.0
just the thing that

6006.639 --> 6013.28
pulls the real reward out of you

6010.0 --> 6017.28
if you jump towards it because you can

6013.28 --> 6017.28
then you're not getting the real reward

6020.84 --> 6023.84
um

6026.159 --> 6030.159
because the real reward is the journey

6034.84 --> 6037.84
right

6040.96 --> 6044.8
well that's how you could translate it

6042.96 --> 6046.639
that affiliate open or satan can only

6044.8 --> 6048.96
offer you material wealth at the cost of

6046.639 --> 6054.639
your spiritual currency

6048.96 --> 6058.32
well or it gives you the wealth

6054.639 --> 6060.0
but you lose the opportunity to grow

6058.32 --> 6063.119
towards it and get a better

6060.0 --> 6065.36
better understanding of what the reality

6063.119 --> 6067.839999999999
is of it

6065.36 --> 6068.799999999999
and then eventually the material wealth

6067.84 --> 6070.8
will possess

6068.8 --> 6073.6
you instead of the other way around

6070.8 --> 6077.28
because it will draw your attention

6073.6 --> 6079.84
away from learning and growing in the

6077.28 --> 6079.84
world

6090.69 --> 6094.099999999999
[Music]

6097.65 --> 6101.469999999999
[Music]

6106.56 --> 6112.080000000001
yes chris berry of course it depends on

6108.96 --> 6112.08
the struggle always

6114.88 --> 6121.1990000000005
it's just i just say it

6118.719 --> 6124.0
in specific relation to the concept of

6121.199 --> 6126.239
money having a lot of money

6124.0 --> 6130.48
or getting a lot of money then you can

6126.239 --> 6130.48
use that money to get whatever you want

6132.84 --> 6137.4400000000005
right but it doesn't actually work like

6136.88 --> 6139.76
that

6137.44 --> 6142.48
because often if there's something you

6139.76 --> 6142.4800000000005
really want

6142.96 --> 6149.28
then getting it naturally without just

6146.48 --> 6150.959999999999
money just like that but working towards

6149.28 --> 6154.8
it

6150.96 --> 6155.679
that yeah a lot of the times i just

6154.8 --> 6158.400000000001
think that

6155.679 --> 6159.36
really wanting something is just the

6158.4 --> 6163.28
necessary

6159.36 --> 6165.04
drive for you to start building

6163.28 --> 6167.759999999999
because the building is the really

6165.04 --> 6167.76
important part

6169.04 --> 6172.32
that's where you develop skills that's

6170.639 --> 6177.84
where you develop responsibility

6172.32 --> 6177.84
oversight inside understanding wisdom

6181.119 --> 6186.159
well if you would just get the money you

6184.159 --> 6187.5199999999995
might save a lot of time save a lot of

6186.159 --> 6192.0
struggle

6187.52 --> 6193.52
but would you be better for it

6192.0 --> 6196.4
if you just got it just like that

6193.52 --> 6196.400000000001
without a struggle

6203.52 --> 6219.84
a lot of people just get very arrogant

6224.8 --> 6228.56
you know why people get very arrogant

6227.119 --> 6229.759999999999
when especially when they have a lot of

6228.56 --> 6231.4400000000005
money

6229.76 --> 6233.92
because they don't actually feel like

6231.44 --> 6237.119
they deserve it

6233.92 --> 6238.0
so they try to reinforce that they

6237.119 --> 6241.44
deserve it

6238.0 --> 6243.6
by being arrogant to themselves

6241.44 --> 6245.44
it's a reinforcement for themselves like

6243.6 --> 6249.1990000000005
yes i am worth it

6245.44 --> 6249.199
it's like a confidence thing

6250.159 --> 6256.638999999999
to mask that inside

6253.52 --> 6261.84
they know they don't actually deserve it

6256.639 --> 6263.4400000000005
because of the way they attained it

6261.84 --> 6265.679
that's where a lot of arrogance come

6263.44 --> 6265.678999999999
from

6270.56 --> 6277.360000000001
it's like the the

6274.159 --> 6278.239
essence foundation what what actually

6277.36 --> 6280.96
makes people

6278.239 --> 6281.599999999999
really arrogant is often the realization

6280.96 --> 6284.639
that they

6281.6 --> 6284.639
feel like they really

6284.96 --> 6291.92
didn't deserve that

6288.56 --> 6291.92
so they try to outshine it

6292.08 --> 6295.199
reinforce that they do

6300.84 --> 6303.84
right

6312.4 --> 6317.839999999999
hey ordinary bear good to see you

6319.52 --> 6323.280000000001
everyone creating good intentions we're

6322.08 --> 6326.639
i'm doing my best

6323.28 --> 6329.5199999999995
and i think so is the chat it's very

6326.639 --> 6331.52
good chat very good interactions here i

6329.52 --> 6345.84
really appreciate my chat

6331.52 --> 6345.84
you guys are great

6356.56 --> 6361.92
yes finish that is also true something

6359.36 --> 6364.799999999999
you crafted yourself is always

6361.92 --> 6364.8
more personal

6365.52 --> 6369.84
and i know that it's the reason i became

6367.84 --> 6372.400000000001
a goldsmith

6369.84 --> 6374.88
it's kind of weird right i became a

6372.4 --> 6378.879999999999
coldsmith not because

6374.88 --> 6381.119
i wanted to be the big jewelry guy that

6378.88 --> 6382.96
sells a lot of julie and has a lot of

6381.119 --> 6384.88
money that was not my vision no my

6382.96 --> 6387.04
vision was

6384.88 --> 6388.96
really kind of almost selfish in

6387.04 --> 6393.04
retrospect

6388.96 --> 6396.159
but whatever it is what it is

6393.04 --> 6398.719
it is i want to be able to wear

6396.159 --> 6399.599999999999
my own jewelry and just be able to say

6398.719 --> 6403.92
like yeah

6399.6 --> 6403.92
i'd only wear things that i make myself

6406.719 --> 6415.84
when it comes to metals

6410.0 --> 6415.84
and then i know what it is

6416.56 --> 6421.280000000001
like for example this thing here this is

6419.6 --> 6425.84
a great pendant

6421.28 --> 6430.88
it's also a medical device you know why

6425.84 --> 6433.679
because it is as pure as you get silver

6430.88 --> 6435.6
so i can literally use the pure silver

6433.679 --> 6436.719
this is not like sterling silver this is

6435.6 --> 6439.76
pure silver

6436.719 --> 6441.199
i know because i made it myself i had

6439.76 --> 6445.92
the original plate

6441.199 --> 6445.919999999999
ordered from pure silver

6446.639 --> 6455.04
right so it and i like things that way

6451.84 --> 6459.4400000000005
because it's just dependent but i can

6455.04 --> 6459.44
dual use it as a medical device

6464.32 --> 6468.88
right and i even learned that after

6466.88 --> 6470.2390000000005
because at first it was just no i think

6468.88 --> 6471.76
julie is really cool

6470.239 --> 6473.759999999999
i like silver and all that [ __ ] it's

6471.76 --> 6474.56
just way too expensive and i know better

6473.76 --> 6476.76
things like i

6474.56 --> 6478.320000000001
i'm gonna make it i'm gonna do my

6476.76 --> 6482.159000000001
symbolics.now

6478.32 --> 6484.88
make my own symbol symbolism

6482.159 --> 6487.04
and all that and yeah that's what i did

6484.88 --> 6489.119
and then i figured out like oh wait

6487.04 --> 6491.119
like silver is actually there's like

6489.119 --> 6492.88
medical benefits from this these health

6491.119 --> 6494.799999999999
benefits and all these things that i

6492.88 --> 6497.679
then learn and the conspiracy theo

6494.8 --> 6498.0
it kind of bloomed up at the same time

6497.679 --> 6501.04
first

6498.0 --> 6504.56
i got into alex jones and conspiracy

6501.04 --> 6507.119
theory 911 and all that

6504.56 --> 6507.119000000001
and then

6508.88 --> 6512.32
i got into goldsmithing and then i

6510.8 --> 6513.1990000000005
figured out like wait there's something

6512.32 --> 6515.04
about metals

6513.199 --> 6517.5199999999995
that's interesting what is sterling

6515.04 --> 6521.199
silver sterling silver is

6517.52 --> 6524.0
a pure silver mixed in with copper seven

6521.199 --> 6526.0
and a half percent copper in sterling

6524.0 --> 6529.04
silver and why do they do that

6526.0 --> 6531.199
well because the copper makes the silver

6529.04 --> 6533.6
a lot stronger

6531.199 --> 6534.879999999999
the amalgamation of it the mixing of it

6533.6 --> 6538.08
makes it much

6534.88 --> 6540.08
stronger less bendy so

6538.08 --> 6541.6
this works out great because it's kind

6540.08 --> 6543.119
of a plate

6541.6 --> 6545.119000000001
doesn't have things sticking out but if

6543.119 --> 6548.0
you have for example a little ring

6545.119 --> 6549.92
or like a ladies ring usually very thin

6548.0 --> 6552.48
if that was pure silver

6549.92 --> 6553.76
you do this and it's completely bent out

6552.48 --> 6557.119
of shape

6553.76 --> 6558.08
because silver is kind of soft pure

6557.119 --> 6559.839999999999
silver

6558.08 --> 6561.599
if you put just that little seven and a

6559.84 --> 6564.400000000001
half percent copper in there

6561.599 --> 6566.84
then suddenly it becomes a lot stronger

6564.4 --> 6569.839999999999
a lot stronger so that's why they do

6566.84 --> 6569.84
that

6570.08 --> 6572.4
all right

6575.22 --> 6583.84
[Music]

6576.4 --> 6583.839999999999
yeah i'm a goldsmith i know these things

6588.0 --> 6592.159
and they do the same thing with gold by

6589.84 --> 6592.159000000001
the way

6593.119 --> 6596.4
there's even more copper in general in

6595.44 --> 6601.04
gold

6596.4 --> 6601.04
than there is in silver

6603.119 --> 6606.799999999999
because gold is really super soft it's

6605.92 --> 6610.4
like

6606.8 --> 6612.56
oh yeah incredibly soft very prone to

6610.4 --> 6615.759999999999
denting and all that

6612.56 --> 6618.320000000001
unless it is completely squeezed like

6615.76 --> 6620.8
you can compress

6618.32 --> 6621.36
gold and then it becomes a lot stronger

6620.8 --> 6624.96
and

6621.36 --> 6628.159
also extremely rigid right

6624.96 --> 6632.08
but yeah if you're gonna make a

6628.159 --> 6634.239
ring and it's like a design and details

6632.08 --> 6635.92
that's not compressed you're gonna be

6634.239 --> 6637.44
heating it as you make it

6635.92 --> 6639.599
then it's not compressed anywhere once

6637.44 --> 6642.96
you hit it it's not compressed anymore

6639.599 --> 6645.360000000001
so it's going to be super soft right so

6642.96 --> 6648.4
you have to mix in copper

6645.36 --> 6650.799999999999
or it's just in tanable

6648.4 --> 6651.5199999999995
unless you want to make like a solid

6650.8 --> 6654.4800000000005
gold

6651.52 --> 6655.040000000001
ring and then it just becomes like a

6654.48 --> 6658.159
lump

6655.04 --> 6661.44
of gold and then just compressed it's

6658.159 --> 6661.44
going to be super basic

6662.4 --> 6666.159
i've see i i've it's a long time ago but

6665.84 --> 6670.4800000000005
i

6666.159 --> 6672.4
knew like a an arab guy that had a ring

6670.48 --> 6674.48
like that

6672.4 --> 6677.92
it's just pure gold compressed and

6674.48 --> 6677.919999999999
that's how it remained hard

6678.32 --> 6684.08
he was really into pure gold right

6681.679 --> 6684.08
anyway

6687.36 --> 6692.719
one kilogram bar of pure silver you love

6689.92 --> 6696.639
holding it for no reason

6692.719 --> 6697.199
i get that do realize though that pure

6696.639 --> 6700.8
silver

6697.199 --> 6703.598999999999
it reacts to your skin right because

6700.8 --> 6704.4800000000005
we naturally build up uh what is it like

6703.599 --> 6708.2390000000005
certain types of

6704.48 --> 6711.28
acids just through our sweat

6708.239 --> 6712.239
and even in your saliva right so if you

6711.28 --> 6714.639
keep touching it

6712.239 --> 6715.36
it will eventually start to like react

6714.639 --> 6718.2390000000005
with that

6715.36 --> 6719.679
unless you keep it in plastic and just

6718.239 --> 6721.598999999999
grab onto the plastic

6719.679 --> 6724.2390000000005
but you got to realize that silver

6721.599 --> 6724.2390000000005
reacts

6726.56 --> 6732.0
unlike gold gold does not or barely

6730.0 --> 6734.239
reacts to anything and only very

6732.0 --> 6737.92
specific types of acids

6734.239 --> 6739.759999999999
king's water but silver reacts a lot

6737.92 --> 6743.599
easier with a lot of things including

6739.76 --> 6743.599
just stuff on your skin

6745.199 --> 6748.719
but then again yeah touching silver is

6748.239 --> 6751.36
good

6748.719 --> 6765.84
because that way it rubs off right and

6751.36 --> 6765.839999999999
then you absorb the silver molecules

6767.92 --> 6779.1990000000005
youtube guy that melts all kinds of

6769.92 --> 6782.56
stuff and makes it into metal bars

6779.199 --> 6784.799999999999
ooh silver plated copper band

6782.56 --> 6784.8
right

6785.679 --> 6791.4400000000005
well copper is very special

6789.44 --> 6793.759999999999
like there are some there's weird things

6791.44 --> 6797.28
about cover

6793.76 --> 6802.4800000000005
and silver and gold all of it they're

6797.28 --> 6804.48
they're not primary like primary trade

6802.48 --> 6805.598999999999
materials for no good reason because

6804.48 --> 6808.638999999999
they all have their

6805.599 --> 6809.1990000000005
effects for example did you know that if

6808.639 --> 6812.2390000000005
you take

6809.199 --> 6812.719
gardening tools that are made of pure

6812.239 --> 6815.199
copper

6812.719 --> 6816.639
pure copper not just some amalgamation

6815.199 --> 6822.08
but pure

6816.639 --> 6824.08
that it really enhances the soil

6822.08 --> 6826.32
really a lot it's it's kind of

6824.08 --> 6829.599
mysterious it's like an electrical

6826.32 --> 6830.5599999999995
or electrostatical magnetical something

6829.599 --> 6834.0
a process

6830.56 --> 6835.679
that happens and it greatly improves the

6834.0 --> 6839.119
quality of the dirt

6835.679 --> 6842.4
you apply it to like

6839.119 --> 6843.92
measurable so there is something special

6842.4 --> 6846.239
about copper there's also this thing

6843.92 --> 6852.08
about putting copper rings around

6846.239 --> 6852.08
uh trees it also does something

6853.52 --> 6857.280000000001
something good so wearing a copper

6856.0 --> 6862.0
bracelet

6857.28 --> 6863.92
maybe yeah you're having the same effect

6862.0 --> 6866.08
i don't even remember exactly what that

6863.92 --> 6868.56
is what that's supposed to be but i know

6866.08 --> 6868.5599999999995
it's there

6869.36 --> 6876.719
any advices on both patches

6872.4 --> 6878.719
uh don't worry about it

6876.719 --> 6880.719
because if you're going to grow obsessed

6878.719 --> 6881.84
about any potential bald patches or

6880.719 --> 6885.599
losing hair you're

6881.84 --> 6889.04
very likely to end up losing more hair

6885.599 --> 6892.0
so if you just don't worry about it and

6889.04 --> 6892.32
for example ignore trolls that think

6892.0 --> 6894.32
that

6892.32 --> 6896.719
by saying something like that they can

6894.32 --> 6899.92
like oh remind you of some part that you

6896.719 --> 6902.4
didn't like well it's barely bold

6899.92 --> 6904.08
i have great hair oh and it's kind of

6902.4 --> 6907.04
been like this for 20

6904.08 --> 6909.36
years right i remember when i did was

6907.04 --> 6911.5199999999995
doing goldsmithing

6909.36 --> 6913.04
that somebody was saying just that to me

6911.52 --> 6914.8
and it was a girl and they didn't even

6913.04 --> 6916.84
mean anything negative it's just like oh

6914.8 --> 6921.28
you're going to get bold and like

6916.84 --> 6924.719
no no i'm not

6921.28 --> 6928.32
and hey guess what now

6924.719 --> 6929.04
it's 15 years later and i still got my

6928.32 --> 6931.599
hair

6929.04 --> 6933.04
yeah it's not perfect anymore i'm not 20

6931.599 --> 6936.4800000000005
years old

6933.04 --> 6940.56
right but i got it

6936.48 --> 6941.678999999999
so i'm yeah what do you do against bald

6940.56 --> 6943.679
patches nothing

6941.679 --> 6947.36
you just don't worry about it because

6943.679 --> 6950.56
stressing out only makes it worse

6947.36 --> 6952.639
and hey if if you or

6950.56 --> 6953.76
somebody you really care about and you

6952.639 --> 6956.88
can trust

6953.76 --> 6957.679
doesn't like it anymore then i don't

6956.88 --> 6960.639
know

6957.679 --> 6962.2390000000005
i i have yet to reach that stage myself

6960.639 --> 6963.679
as a man

6962.239 --> 6966.08
because i think that when i'm going to

6963.679 --> 6968.2390000000005
be a lot older i will probably get kind

6966.08 --> 6971.44
of bullish

6968.239 --> 6973.839999999999
more but that that always happens to

6971.44 --> 6975.678999999999
people when they get a lot older or

6973.84 --> 6978.08
almost always it's very rare that it

6975.679 --> 6978.08
doesn't

6981.599 --> 6986.96
right but for somebody with yeah 41 i

6984.88 --> 6989.84
think i got great hair

6986.96 --> 6989.84
very proud of it

6992.48 --> 6997.119
yes i know number five i know i

6995.36 --> 7000.32
specifically showed it

6997.119 --> 7003.92
i remember that you know why i showed it

7000.32 --> 7004.799999999999
because it's really nothing i'm 41 years

7003.92 --> 7007.52
old and i got

7004.8 --> 7007.52
great hair

7010.96 --> 7014.4
very happy with my hair i take good care

7012.96 --> 7019.76
of my hair i don't over

7014.4 --> 7019.759999999999
wash my hair but i do keep it clean

7020.239 --> 7024.879999999999
and i'm very careful when combing

7023.199 --> 7026.32
because when you get all aggressive

7024.88 --> 7029.119
yeah yeah you're gonna wreck your own

7026.32 --> 7033.04
hair if you're not careful

7029.119 --> 7035.92
right so i'm not afraid

7033.04 --> 7036.56
i'm good yeah it's not perfect it's not

7035.92 --> 7040.08
perfect

7036.56 --> 7040.080000000001
i'm good though great

7043.199 --> 7046.799999999999
so unless you have like specific

7045.92 --> 7049.679
baldness

7046.8 --> 7050.4800000000005
allergy when you see that you get all

7049.679 --> 7053.119
triggered yeah

7050.48 --> 7053.598999999999
i might have yeah you may have a problem

7053.119 --> 7056.08
when

7053.599 --> 7058.2390000000005
going face to face with me because

7056.08 --> 7059.679
you're sometimes going to see a bit of a

7058.239 --> 7062.879999999999
baldish

7059.679 --> 7066.88
spot right on top

7062.88 --> 7068.159000000001
but that's it oh here all the rest of it

7066.88 --> 7071.1990000000005
is great i got hair

7068.159 --> 7073.04
i can just put it loose like this it's

7071.199 --> 7075.5199999999995

7073.04 --> 7075.5199999999995

7077.76 --> 7082.8

7080.8 --> 7086.8
do

7082.8 --> 7090.159000000001
right yeah started growing my hair when

7086.8 --> 7090.159000000001
i was freaking 11.

7095.04 --> 7099.44
like i had my hair still growing when

7097.84 --> 7101.4400000000005
people around me were all

7099.44 --> 7104.638999999999
shaving their heads because of like the

7101.44 --> 7106.159
hardcore was all getting all popularized

7104.639 --> 7108.159000000001
especially in the netherlands right so

7106.159 --> 7111.36
everyone is freaking shaving their hair

7108.159 --> 7111.36
a lot of people did that

7111.44 --> 7118.4
in my school i didn't

7115.199 --> 7121.119
nope got long hair

7118.4 --> 7121.119
30 years

7126.08 --> 7130.08
would you get a crew cut i don't know

7128.08 --> 7133.5199999999995

7130.08 --> 7133.5199999999995
i haven't had my hair cut

7135.599 --> 7140.96

33 years of long hair

7170.159 --> 7174.4
all right i'm gonna round out the show

7171.92 --> 7176.96
by the way i'm forgetting the time

7174.4 --> 7178.239
just troll baiting now like why am i

7176.96 --> 7180.0
talking about hair

7178.239 --> 7182.08
whatever my hair is great i'm really

7180.0 --> 7185.199
happy with it it's not perfect

7182.08 --> 7187.92
yeah i'm a human being i will grow old

7185.199 --> 7191.598999999999
and die at some point

7187.92 --> 7198.56

7191.599 --> 7200.639
very lucky with the hair i got

7198.56 --> 7205.280000000001
because i had friends that were like
