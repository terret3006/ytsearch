Dostoevsky Harry's egg hunt

203.09 --> 213.05
William picot righteous force dank they

208.8 --> 213.05
lie Ohio yeah good to see you all

214.31 --> 223.709
Saturday morning and quite calm as I

220.44 --> 225.98
expected yeah yesterday night was quite

223.709 --> 225.98
busy

232.52 --> 242.04000000000002
this black metal skill Oh God really

238.41 --> 246.99
I'm on the black metal skill now but I

242.04 --> 253.47
don't even listen black metal is anyway

246.99 --> 257.79
it's not really my pet it's it's kind of

253.47 --> 262.29
an odd bird and I think his parents are

257.79 --> 263.49
still around and I don't know he's just

262.29 --> 265.41
a weird Crow

263.49 --> 267.09000000000003
sometimes I get the feeling he doesn't

265.41 --> 269.34000000000003
really want to grow up or something

267.09 --> 271.22999999999996
because he he does keep on begging to

269.34 --> 273.26
his parents and they are very annoyed by

271.23 --> 273.26
it

273.86 --> 283.38
maybe it's just a phase

275.91 --> 286.11
maybe it's his black metal phase yeah I

283.38 --> 288.42
look apart though yeah I guess so well

286.11 --> 293.0
that's also due to a lack of different

288.42 --> 296.19
types of clothing although I do have

293.0 --> 301.74
white clothing I actually considered

296.19 --> 306.15
putting them on today but yeah that'd be

301.74 --> 308.19
too fresh for me cuz yeah I can wear it

306.15 --> 310.22999999999996
I don't have a sweater that is wider or

308.19 --> 312.0
anything so if we put this sweater over

310.23 --> 317.93
it you wouldn't see it anyway it's no

312.0 --> 317.93
use for that but yeah I do feel it and

318.17 --> 324.56
I've been thinking a lot about the way I

321.21 --> 324.56
look recently

336.46 --> 340.33
just pecking on the roof

344.41 --> 364.87
he's always screwing around trying

346.57 --> 368.68
things out but um let's see it sounds

364.87 --> 371.98
weird but I'm so stuck to the way I look

368.68 --> 374.83
and into a general habit of not really

371.98 --> 377.56
liking change I really don't know how

374.83 --> 382.87
else to look that sounds really weird

377.56 --> 386.14
doesn't it for me the mustache was quite

382.87 --> 388.18
a challenge to take a change but hey

386.14 --> 392.26
when I decide something I go for it and

388.18 --> 393.7
now I kind of can't let that go even

392.26 --> 398.64
though I've even considered that it's

393.7 --> 403.78
just I don't like change in in my looks

398.64 --> 408.57
no no sir check oh no I'm not gonna do

403.78 --> 411.79999999999995
that absolutely not

408.57 --> 411.8
[Music]

417.25 --> 424.78
but I am kind of open for like what what

421.96 --> 430.26
kind of yeah it's almost like it would

424.78 --> 434.04999999999995
be nice and in the past I've before

430.26 --> 436.03
usually accompanied by a lady but yeah

434.05 --> 439.57
because some of them just really good at

436.03 --> 441.58
it and try things out and reflect upon

439.57 --> 445.48
it if I do that on my own

441.58 --> 447.31
I feel just horrendous ly uncomfortable

445.48 --> 455.11
and I wouldn't really know what to think

447.31 --> 458.44
of it but yeah anyway I don't really

455.11 --> 460.96000000000004
have money for new clothing all night

458.44 --> 463.18
yeah yeah on the skill that would really

460.96 --> 466.29999999999995
matter I'm just repairing clothes I

463.18 --> 471.1
fixed these shoes very happy they look

466.3 --> 473.35
better this were my other set like the

471.1 --> 477.90000000000003
heels were just off they were broken off

473.35 --> 481.02000000000004
and and the cobbler managed to fix it

477.9 --> 484.39
it's just incredible you did a great job

481.02 --> 488.4
very happy about it and I brought my

484.39 --> 488.4
other shoes that also had issues and

489.09 --> 493.14
it's barely costing me anything

503.25 --> 509.71
Yeah right

505.54 --> 514.24
also I've noticed kind of it sneaked up

509.71 --> 519.76
on me I think I'm in a in a new food

514.24 --> 522.4300000000001
transition as I became vegetarian was it

519.76 --> 523.78
it wasn't this last May right it was the

522.43 --> 526.54
year before that I've been vegetarian

523.78 --> 534.73
for a long time I think how long has it

526.54 --> 536.1999999999999
been but I think I just figured out now

534.73 --> 538.95
with the cheese like there's a real

536.2 --> 546.94
issue with it I haven't eaten any of it

538.95 --> 550.48
for two days and it's like whoa well my

546.94 --> 554.5600000000001
metabolism is just like so much better

550.48 --> 558.3100000000001
it's like I can't remember having this

554.56 --> 561.52
little problems so it seems that yeah

558.31 --> 565.7199999999999
well nobody likes to become lactose

561.52 --> 571.6
intolerant I guess but I guess that it

565.72 --> 573.1
sneaked up on me um yeah at least I

571.6 --> 577.63
didn't get it when I was very young now

573.1 --> 582.4
that would suck yeah I'm new products

577.63 --> 585.64
bad for you yeah I guess I guess they

582.4 --> 588.67
are already weaned myself off milk in my

585.64 --> 591.13
coffee it's just one step at a time and

588.67 --> 593.5
with every step it seemed to improve so

591.13 --> 596.98
I guess I'm just doing this empirically

593.5 --> 600.64
you know I'm not going with oh you have

596.98 --> 608.41
to be vegan or it's like oh it's all

600.64 --> 613.84
good no I'm just carefully figuring out

608.41 --> 618.25
what is best for my body and my

613.84 --> 621.19
metabolism and it seems that I just have

618.25 --> 624.87
to cut down on the cheese I guess and

621.19 --> 624.87
while milk was already out

627.16 --> 633.73
and I'm gonna have to like rearrange all

630.55 --> 636.31
the food packages to get enough of

633.73 --> 639.69
everything and get used to different

636.31 --> 642.01
ways of eating because I don't like

639.69 --> 645.07
stopping eating certain things

642.01 --> 651.0699999999999
especially if they like them for the

645.07 --> 654.37
taste and all that so anyway I'll get

651.07 --> 656.71
over it I'm I guess I'm gonna be eating

654.37 --> 660.28
avocados now on a regular basis does

656.71 --> 660.94
seem to have been doing a lot of good so

660.28 --> 663.73
far

660.94 --> 666.3900000000001
yeah so it's a bit of a food intro I

663.73 --> 666.39
guess today

675.06 --> 684.4499999999999
yeah also not surprisingly thinking a

678.39 --> 686.37
lot about yeah women girlfriends or just

684.45 --> 691.11
friends or what do you even do with

686.37 --> 693.14
people besides just talk and now I guess

691.11 --> 698.16
that people that really know me well

693.14 --> 701.34
like in person they know it's it's a bit

698.16 --> 702.12
weird that it's almost like I'm always

701.34 --> 704.97
like this

702.12 --> 707.79
I just talk a lot and I'm good at it and

704.97 --> 713.07
I can put down good stories it's just

707.79 --> 715.4699999999999
that I well before this right even with

713.07 --> 719.57
my ex-girlfriend I spend a lot of time

715.47 --> 722.37
playing video games and I'm even

719.57 --> 726.2700000000001
relatively good at helping somebody or

722.37 --> 729.2
like really getting them on the get

726.27 --> 732.36
giving them the feel of what is the real

729.2 --> 734.5500000000001
how to use your senses to feel in the

732.36 --> 736.77
game to really adapt to the game to get

734.55 --> 738.5699999999999
what's what's going on how we work that

736.77 --> 744.3299999999999
kind of thing so video games for me was

738.57 --> 748.0500000000001
previous platform but as I've now been

744.33 --> 752.61
going after my ex for like five I barely

748.05 --> 755.28
play video games anymore and the only

752.61 --> 757.13
thing I could even imagine I was

755.28 --> 759.78
thinking would be kind of like fun

757.13 --> 763.02
playing together with others yeah that

759.78 --> 768.78
would be more it sounds weird but like

763.02 --> 772.02
Nintendo like games because like the few

768.78 --> 777.63
of those the cartoonish feel of that

772.02 --> 780.36
world like what is it like Mario 3d that

777.63 --> 783.54
kind of game I've played that a few

780.36 --> 785.49
times it's just really awesome in a way

783.54 --> 787.92
like that could be really amusing to

785.49 --> 790.65
play with somebody but still like gaming

787.92 --> 795.38
is not really the way I want to connect

790.65 --> 800.63
to women so I don't really know anymore

795.38 --> 803.11
what do I do I know I like go out like

800.63 --> 811.54
good food

803.11 --> 813.78
of course like the yeah god I'm openly

811.54 --> 817.63
profiling myself for a dating this is

813.78 --> 819.72
silly but I'm I'm just trying to figure

817.63 --> 826.84
it out for myself

819.72 --> 831.57
because in that sense I've always had

826.84 --> 834.9100000000001
trouble just figuring out how to connect

831.57 --> 840.6700000000001
because I you can have contact but that

834.91 --> 844.06
doesn't mean that you actually can offer

840.67 --> 845.77
something that the other needs and it's

844.06 --> 849.3699999999999
not always apparent what they need

845.77 --> 854.4399999999999
especially to me I you could say I don't

849.37 --> 856.8100000000001
understand a lot of women it's like I

854.44 --> 859.1500000000001
can feel their feelings and I can

856.81 --> 862.4699999999999
predict responses but I don't understand

859.15 --> 862.47
and despite all that

868.03 --> 871.169
[Music]

873.05 --> 879.29
my entertainment exists outside watching

876.14 --> 881.81
the lights in the sky Missouri bear yeah

879.29 --> 886.8199999999999
well one there twinkling a lot like

881.81 --> 889.6099999999999
yesterday night yeah that that's then it

886.82 --> 892.6400000000001
is fascinating I I watched the skies

889.61 --> 894.83
yesterday night Oh didn't I make a moon

892.64 --> 898.15
video I think I almost forgot about that

894.83 --> 901.2800000000001
it was very short though because the

898.15 --> 905.99
weird lead the battery ran out for the

901.28 --> 909.41
first time I'm on video yeah right clear

905.99 --> 915.65
night sky November moon November 8th

909.41 --> 919.79
moon yeah I didn't never got to trying

915.65 --> 922.43
to catch a star I want to try that

919.79 --> 924.8
I hope there's well maybe this night

922.43 --> 926.9599999999999
there will be a clear sky or anyway the

924.8 --> 931.6099999999999
next convenience I will try to use the

926.96 --> 935.0600000000001
p900 to to get a good shot of the of

931.61 --> 937.9300000000001
some stars that would be very

935.06 --> 937.93
interesting I think

944.889 --> 958.19
right well AGM the weird thing is some

953.87 --> 961.43
woman I just understand fantastic but

958.19 --> 965.9590000000001
you know how that works it's because

961.43 --> 968.029
they want me to understand them because

965.959 --> 969.829
they are actually opening up to me and

968.029 --> 972.079
then suddenly it connects and all my

969.829 --> 981.13
skills fall in place and I know what to

972.079 --> 985.4899999999999
do but that that kind of rarely happens

981.13 --> 990.62
it requires like a spontaneous bumping

985.49 --> 992.6
into in whatever situation and done like

990.62 --> 999.5600000000001
the spark has to and it's not like Oh

992.6 --> 1002.82
sexy spark but just this contact and it

999.56 --> 1002.8199999999999
so rarely happens

1012.999 --> 1017.649
menace 2 sobriety I have no idea

1015.309 --> 1018.3689999999999
Nathan's out of focus shots look I'm

1017.649 --> 1021.54
just gonna

1018.369 --> 1023.769
I'm literally fooling around on my own

1021.54 --> 1026.98
literally fighting trying to figure it

1023.769 --> 1029.26
out with the p900 and there's a good

1026.98 --> 1034.48
chance it it will look a bit blurry or

1029.26 --> 1036.8799999999999
whatever I'm gonna try and if it's

1034.48 --> 1040.6
really just not worthy of seeing then

1036.88 --> 1043.949
I'm I'm not gonna post it but if it is

1040.6 --> 1043.9489999999998
gonna be interesting then I will

1061.27 --> 1067.12
okay that's some weird descriptions of

1064.87 --> 1076.9499999999998
how to deal with women their feet or the

1067.12 --> 1079.51
surf ski look the only way I've ever

1076.95 --> 1081.16
know how this sounds just weird the only

1079.51 --> 1084.55
way that I've read it ever really dealt

1081.16 --> 1087.7900000000002
with women in some kind of hostility is

1084.55 --> 1093.52
acted hostility because they were

1087.79 --> 1097.05
literally like pushing me against my

1093.52 --> 1100.929
will to be angry because they want me to

1097.05 --> 1108.76
rage and thought it was sexy like that

1100.929 --> 1112.0
[ __ ] this is so no but that's like when

1108.76 --> 1115.72
you're already in a relation that's not

1112.0 --> 1118.57
that never dad that's insane doing that

1115.72 --> 1121.14
on the first meeting that's just that

1118.57 --> 1121.1399999999999
it's wrong

1133.26 --> 1137.73
misery bear finding women who's got her

1136.169 --> 1141.8090000000002
feet planted in the ground can be

1137.73 --> 1143.549
challenging but not impossible right but

1141.809 --> 1145.5
Missouri but this is what I'm thinking

1143.549 --> 1150.21
about now and and this is my problem

1145.5 --> 1157.02
because I do take notice of women and

1150.21 --> 1159.5
and I'm trying to figure out also like

1157.02 --> 1164.34
what they're dealing with if they're

1159.5 --> 1167.96
facing some kind of difficult opposing

1164.34 --> 1170.4599999999998
the world like that the sense for that

1167.96 --> 1173.22
that is something that I do take notice

1170.46 --> 1177.66
of when when yeah because it's very

1173.22 --> 1180.48
similar to what I deal with or have been

1177.66 --> 1188.97
for a long time and then I just try to

1180.48 --> 1191.97
figure out like what is it all right now

1188.97 --> 1195.059
I'm just being stupid because I already

1191.97 --> 1199.1100000000001
know my answer even before I said what I

1195.059 --> 1204.48
was gonna ask but you start to wonder

1199.11 --> 1205.52
like as an example like what is going on

1204.48 --> 1210.48
with them

1205.52 --> 1212.76
why do they feel like sometimes they

1210.48 --> 1215.79
have like self worthy issues for example

1212.76 --> 1217.35
and it's all like puzzles and I kind of

1215.79 --> 1219.51
want to figure it out but I can also

1217.35 --> 1222.87
feel that that's just this pain involved

1219.51 --> 1227.58
and then just wonder like am I supposed

1222.87 --> 1229.9189999999999
to do that am I supposed to help them

1227.58 --> 1235.1299999999999
tackle it or is it meant for somebody

1229.919 --> 1242.13
else because they're not jumping on me

1235.13 --> 1247.89
you know and sometimes women do do that

1242.13 --> 1250.5900000000001
and then I fix it just right or give

1247.89 --> 1253.6200000000001
like some really straight say something

1250.59 --> 1257.84
that nobody dares to say them to their

1253.62 --> 1261.09
face at birth and I'll just say it

1257.84 --> 1263.9099999999999
because I know that that is the key to

1261.09 --> 1268.23
cheats to a certain swish

1263.91 --> 1272.01
that needs to be turned its just

1268.23 --> 1274.43
intuitive anyway yeah it is getting very

1272.01 --> 1274.43
vague

1284.18 --> 1288.94
okay interesting Phil Cooper good for

1286.85 --> 1288.9399999999998
you

1289.54 --> 1294.9099999999999
yeah flat earth dating apps and websites

1295.72 --> 1301.49
yeah that's that's been on for a while I

1299.33 --> 1303.71
remember that coming up

1301.49 --> 1306.56
it's just that I wasn't really looking

1303.71 --> 1309.22
for but now it might be interesting to

1306.56 --> 1309.22
look into

1316.74 --> 1329.27
but you know Zep tepi in a way also for

1319.89 --> 1333.539
me because so many so many people just

1329.27 --> 1336.45
have a social life in groups you know I

1333.539 --> 1339.779
have in groups and then they have their

1336.45 --> 1342.51
own personal thing next to that I barely

1339.779 --> 1347.909
really have a group that's really an

1342.51 --> 1351.059
actual group and therefore I just need

1347.909 --> 1355.2890000000002
to sample but I need to go out there and

1351.059 --> 1358.049
just scour around and for groups and

1355.289 --> 1365.429
just feel what's around what's going on

1358.049 --> 1373.22
and also like what has become normal

1365.429 --> 1373.22
yeah but anyway yeah

1373.49 --> 1376.49
Ellis

1385.84 --> 1397.51
but Zep tepi thanks for the tip I might

1393.25 --> 1403.75
take a peek at the Flat Earth dating

1397.51 --> 1409.6
websites that's just to see the crow

1403.75 --> 1419.52
agrees with you I guess yeah he's still

1409.6 --> 1419.52
just right there it's hilarious

1421.21 --> 1435.8400000000001
I can do way a co show a duel show with

1427.6 --> 1435.84
George right George

1444.299 --> 1450.779
yeah with foreigners all the time online

1447.769 --> 1454.499
yeah you got a point you got a point

1450.779 --> 1458.009
cept a PB cuz a lot of Dutch people are

1454.499 --> 1461.789
kind of impressed that I'm good at

1458.009 --> 1468.299
English and that I really deal with with

1461.789 --> 1470.58
a wider community and they're also a

1468.299 --> 1473.9089999999999
little intimidated by it but at the same

1470.58 --> 1476.279
time I do notice just because of being

1473.909 --> 1478.0790000000002
exposed to it through TV through what I

1476.279 --> 1480.45
see you other people doing what goes

1478.079 --> 1484.499
around on the streets that there is a

1480.45 --> 1487.499
lot of Dutch squabbling and talking and

1484.499 --> 1499.6490000000001
ideas going on as well just separately

1487.499 --> 1501.499
no I feed the crows I'm not gonna buy a

1499.649 --> 1505.039
girlfriend thank you very much Lottie

1501.499 --> 1505.039
it's terrible

1510.27 --> 1517.289
until she started what

1513.34 --> 1517.289
what the hell are you talking about

1523.23 --> 1530.69
a stalker works at the morgue on a plane

1526.14 --> 1530.69
hmm okay

1539.25 --> 1549.87
kiss the crow that's hilarious dank well

1542.88 --> 1552.39
I can't get closer than like 1015

1549.87 --> 1556.01
centimeters to it before it flies away

1552.39 --> 1556.01
I'll show you again

1567.11 --> 1573.08
oh wait I've got a brilliant piece of

1569.779 --> 1575.23
bread just to demonstrate but it's not

1573.08 --> 1578.51
interested in getting touched it just

1575.23 --> 1582.519
wants food this and it's just like

1578.51 --> 1585.519
giving no shits it's being teenager

1582.519 --> 1585.519
cheeky

1633.85 --> 1638.58
right anyway that was a funny moment

1653.23 --> 1657.789
right

1654.63 --> 1657.7890000000002
[Music]

1658.16 --> 1668.24
Chuck that you know Rupert I'm already

1663.46 --> 1670.88
totally black like if I put the

1668.24 --> 1673.4
trenchcoat on to it it's more like I'm

1670.88 --> 1675.47
spreading out my wings a little more

1673.4 --> 1679.0900000000001
that's what it's like to it doesn't

1675.47 --> 1682.3600000000001
really can't really tell the difference

1679.09 --> 1685.4299999999998
yeah I tried that on a plane but I

1682.36 --> 1688.2199999999998
couldn't it never works I've tried many

1685.43 --> 1688.78
many times now like ten times or

1688.22 --> 1691.94
something

1688.78 --> 1694.52
but it always just flies away you can't

1691.94 --> 1705.47
get closer than like this kind of

1694.52 --> 1707.53
distance never works grocery stores and

1705.47 --> 1707.53
churches

1709.62 --> 1714.7399999999998
well to be fair Missouri bird yeah I do

1715.7 --> 1728.1000000000001
bump into like pretty nice young ladies

1722.54 --> 1734.76
at the grocery store even where I go so

1728.1 --> 1736.7099999999998
but I just try to be casual I for me

1734.76 --> 1739.14
it's more a challenge to just keep

1736.71 --> 1742.6200000000001
communicating in general and not be just

1739.14 --> 1745.5900000000001
a totally silent figure in black roaming

1742.62 --> 1748.7099999999998
around quickly because I have been like

1745.59 --> 1750.54
that don't want to go back there and I'm

1748.71 --> 1753.24
just trying to keep communicating and if

1750.54 --> 1755.01
I'm constantly focusing like oh I could

1753.24 --> 1757.79
get a girlfriend out of this I could do

1755.01 --> 1761.4
it then I'm just gonna get more nervous

1757.79 --> 1764.34
causing me to again kind of retreat and

1761.4 --> 1770.88
I don't want that I just want to keep it

1764.34 --> 1773.34
normal and a if I see it like this

1770.88 --> 1775.0200000000002
putting myself down a bit so don't take

1773.34 --> 1779.309
it literally but if somebody's crazy

1775.02 --> 1786.09
enough to ask me out I'll do it I guess

1779.309 --> 1788.49
if if I like the idea or even if just

1786.09 --> 1790.76
from a friendships point of view you

1788.49 --> 1793.38
know I'm open to that kind of [ __ ]

1790.76 --> 1795.89
depending on what they're gonna want me

1793.38 --> 1795.89
to do but

1799.96 --> 1809.74
must be tough to find a woman as a flat

1802.09 --> 1812.52
earther now finding a woman is not the

1809.74 --> 1812.52
hard part it's

1815.29 --> 1821.35
even before I was a flat earther I had

1818.14 --> 1825.6100000000001
the same type of issues it's just a

1821.35 --> 1829.6
connecting for that stuff for me and for

1825.61 --> 1831.6399999999999
a I know I know I've seen people that

1829.6 --> 1834.61
are exactly the opposite for me that

1831.64 --> 1838.3600000000001
just they just connect and they just do

1834.61 --> 1841.2099999999998
that it works fluidly and then at the

1838.36 --> 1845.08
same time typically these type of people

1841.21 --> 1845.799
will have trouble self reflecting on

1845.08 --> 1848.35
things

1845.799 --> 1854.35
oddly enough it's just the exact

1848.35 --> 1856.2099999999998
opposite of what I got no I'm not going

1854.35 --> 1860.34
to ask brand out thank you very much

1856.21 --> 1860.3400000000001
they lie Ohio ill

1871.77 --> 1878.58
noloty says brenda is your ex not mine

1891.49 --> 1895.95
it's getting real ouch

1917.33 --> 1925.529
all right anyway so yeah why don't I

1923.429 --> 1927.45
just talk about the Flat Earth

1925.529 --> 1929.639
everybody makes me talk about dating and

1927.45 --> 1933.96
[ __ ] yeah

1929.639 --> 1937.139
anyway a general bear update for anybody

1933.96 --> 1941.309
wondering yeah like I never talk about

1937.139 --> 1943.4089999999999
porn right I I don't I never even like

1941.309 --> 1949.07
jokes about it because I've always been

1943.409 --> 1953.0390000000002
sexually private and [ __ ] but yeah I

1949.07 --> 1957.389
completely agree that it is wrong and

1953.039 --> 1959.929
big bears overall stance of it is just

1957.389 --> 1962.6999999999998
completely correct

1959.929 --> 1964.2
it literally shames me every time and I

1962.7 --> 1965.3890000000001
hear him say them because he's just so

1964.2 --> 1971.279
spot-on

1965.389 --> 1974.61
and it certainly makes me self reflect

1971.279 --> 1980.309
on well the materials that I've been

1974.61 --> 1982.59
subjected to and just because I'm always

1980.309 --> 1986.269
multitasking even kind of already

1982.59 --> 1989.73
noticing that and worrying about it like

1986.269 --> 1992.22
like being I really have been afraid

1989.73 --> 1996.57
even before all this like where is that

1992.22 --> 1999.48
going it's just going as the Liberals

1996.57 --> 2003.039
and the news and [ __ ] politics go not so

1999.48 --> 2010.759
are these people and it's just scary

2003.039 --> 2014.029
this but yeah don't do it I haven't I

2010.759 --> 2018.71
I'm not person to just like oh no we're

2014.029 --> 2022.46
gonna do it again no I'm more about it's

2018.71 --> 2027.1390000000001
all about the impulse control and

2022.46 --> 2030.98
managing your well thirst as we now

2027.139 --> 2035.57
calls it I thought it was more like

2030.98 --> 2037.009
appetites but to me that word was a

2035.57 --> 2042.009
little bit more appealing but yeah

2037.009 --> 2042.009
thirst appetites and

2044.039 --> 2047.039
right

2050.55 --> 2056.8790000000004
I do feel so much more stable on average

2053.76 --> 2060.0800000000004
now that I've like gone off that and

2056.879 --> 2064.409
still my own little rollercoaster issues

2060.08 --> 2068.0699999999997
but it is noticeable that I do remember

2064.409 --> 2072.649
times when I was like really like trying

2068.07 --> 2075.2400000000002
to using that [ __ ] you know porn as

2072.649 --> 2077.6099999999997
escapism that's like real sex addiction

2075.24 --> 2079.7099999999996
and that is so much worse when you go

2077.61 --> 2082.05
through dark rides when you go through

2079.71 --> 2085.32
the valleys you're so much more

2082.05 --> 2087.4190000000003
vulnerable to the to the whippings of

2085.32 --> 2091.71
the dark ones on the other side I have

2087.419 --> 2098.0699999999997
been so it is remarkable how effective

2091.71 --> 2102.869
it is to really just yeah keep your

2098.07 --> 2106.56
hands on the sheets as it were and also

2102.869 --> 2113.48
yeah definitely and keep your pants

2106.56 --> 2116.94
close behind the computer primarily and

2113.48 --> 2118.7400000000002
so yeah I have to basically publicly

2116.94 --> 2127.17
support that that I get it I just don't

2118.74 --> 2131.8689999999997
like talking about it because how do you

2127.17 --> 2131.869
code that when you George

2132.48 --> 2136.25
George is making a mess again

2147.65 --> 2150.7290000000003
[Music]

2167.47 --> 2171.6699999999996
threw it away down the balcony

2187.43 --> 2192.469
[Music]

2189.469 --> 2192.469
right

2212.16 --> 2225.89
no men's to sobriety now crows are all

2218.58 --> 2225.89
around you know normal birds so nope

2230.38 --> 2233.859
George agrees

2240.64 --> 2254.93
no mark alert he's not named Russell the

2253.04 --> 2266.06
difference between a crow and a raven

2254.93 --> 2271.0099999999998
well Ravens are much bigger and much

2266.06 --> 2273.41
more afraid of humanity they're very

2271.01 --> 2281.17
smart and I don't know you could say

2273.41 --> 2283.8999999999996
that Ravens have like surreal memories

2281.17 --> 2287.66
so they have like this weird memory

2283.9 --> 2289.67
understanding so they know like what

2287.66 --> 2292.64
humanity is doing almost you could

2289.67 --> 2296.48
consider what somebody could say heard

2292.64 --> 2299.0
about it but Ravens are not

2296.48 --> 2302.589
yeah they don't hang around in cities

2299.0 --> 2306.31
they usually stay away from from

2302.589 --> 2312.68
civilized regions as much as possible

2306.31 --> 2315.38
but they're much bigger also I've never

2312.68 --> 2317.71
seen a raven up close only in a great

2315.38 --> 2317.71
distance

2323.84 --> 2328.6600000000003
how do you get that fixed position well

2350.66 --> 2357.769
yeah that's the right that's correct

2353.779 --> 2361.339
Laurie for the Glovers winter is coming

2357.769 --> 2369.1699999999996
oh and for everybody north of the

2361.339 --> 2371.799
Equator as well so don't worry it'll go

2369.17 --> 2371.799
again

2373.67 --> 2377.789
[Music]

2379.91 --> 2387.69
[Music]

2382.829 --> 2387.69
axial tilt lulz

2419.23 --> 2425.09
hmm okay Major Tom how do seasons work

2422.57 --> 2426.98
on a flat earth it's very simple or well

2425.09 --> 2433.04
it's not very simple but it is very

2426.98 --> 2435.35
persistent though there are four seasons

2433.04 --> 2439.0099999999998
and in the four seasons there's a

2435.35 --> 2443.5699999999997
transition between the type of moonlight

2439.01 --> 2449.21
and sunlight output in a gradient

2443.57 --> 2452.09
pattern and a very specific gradient

2449.21 --> 2454.4900000000002
pattern is the output in relation to the

2452.09 --> 2457.6400000000003
position on the earth north and south of

2454.49 --> 2464.0299999999997
the Equator in counter opposite counter

2457.64 --> 2466.7
opposite frequencies and yeah we don't

2464.03 --> 2469.51
understand we I don't necessarily know

2466.7 --> 2472.25
the orientation of it all but that's why

2469.51 --> 2475.2200000000003
it's simply based on the celestial

2472.25 --> 2476.03
patterns and the orientation is just

2475.22 --> 2480.35
what it is

2476.03 --> 2482.9300000000003
doesn't even reveal truly the total

2480.35 --> 2486.04
layout of the land it just reveals the

2482.93 --> 2489.1699999999996
celestial orientation in relation to it

2486.04 --> 2492.25
so that is how the seasons work it's in

2489.17 --> 2495.73
direct relation to the celestial sphere

2492.25 --> 2499.39
orientation and the correlating seasonal

2495.73 --> 2505.97
daylight and night light intensity

2499.39 --> 2508.04
alterations in a sinus pattern in coop

2505.97 --> 2511.37
ization north and south of the Equator

2508.04 --> 2515.48
as for the equator itself I can't

2511.37 --> 2517.69
necessarily explain that I have to don't

2515.48 --> 2517.69
know

2521.98 --> 2531.23
it's like only spring and autumn there I

2528.08 --> 2535.34
think it's always kind of to say it kind

2531.23 --> 2539.12
of hot never really getting cold but it

2535.34 --> 2542.1800000000003
just gets really really rainy in the

2539.12 --> 2544.0099999999998
winters I think on average that's how

2542.18 --> 2546.5299999999997
it's worked how it works at the equator

2544.01 --> 2549.59
so the seasons are quite different

2546.53 --> 2554.32
there there is a season change but it's

2549.59 --> 2554.32
not in the same type of pattern really

2555.13 --> 2560.4100000000003
but still yeah in correlation to the

2557.93 --> 2564.44
orientation of the globe of the heavens

2560.41 --> 2578.3599999999997
so that's our seasons work on the Flat

2564.44 --> 2580.37
Earth whatever the layout may be really

2578.36 --> 2582.55
moonlight has nothing to do with it oh

2580.37 --> 2585.41
really

2582.55 --> 2588.11
because moonlight is not different

2585.41 --> 2592.33
during the winter as it is during the

2588.11 --> 2592.33
summer not at all

2604.12 --> 2610.5099999999998
well Major Tom I just explained to you

2607.24 --> 2612.6699999999996
the exact relations and the patterns

2610.51 --> 2617.4700000000003
that can be deduced out of the data that

2612.67 --> 2620.76
is available so I pointed there is an

2617.47 --> 2625.02
oscillation pattern within the output of

2620.76 --> 2629.0200000000004
the celestial bodies as a specific

2625.02 --> 2631.99
relation within that pattern oriented to

2629.02 --> 2637.2599999999998
how the layout of the earth works so

2631.99 --> 2637.2599999999998
yeah I do understand it

2651.859 --> 2657.38
yes I do I just explained it to you I

2659.54 --> 2666.21
understand so much more of what is going

2662.849 --> 2669.4500000000003
on concerning the seasons the celestial

2666.21 --> 2673.89
bodies their output the orientation than

2669.45 --> 2678.27
any of you even know or understand the

2673.89 --> 2683.43
what why your frickin globe explanation

2678.27 --> 2685.98
even works as it says it does because in

2683.43 --> 2690.569
every subpart of the story there's a

2685.98 --> 2695.04
great Liberty taken already showing many

2690.569 --> 2696.54
explanations that are wrong because it's

2695.04 --> 2699.18
broken apart about some other

2696.54 --> 2701.64
compartmentalized region that undoes

2699.18 --> 2703.8289999999997
that and the globe is full of that kind

2701.64 --> 2706.8489999999997
of [ __ ] and the seasons are one of the

2703.829 --> 2711.119
best examples of the most broken

2706.849 --> 2714.2400000000002
explanation for the globe ever ever

2711.119 --> 2718.29
conceived by anyone it's one of the

2714.24 --> 2722.5099999999998
dumbest season explanations ever heard

2718.29 --> 2722.5099999999998
any cosmology ever

2736.36 --> 2745.92
Oh Oh the heathen so you've been into

2741.49 --> 2745.9199999999996
pseudoscience for 26 years half yeah

2746.22 --> 2753.1299999999997
interesting

2748.17 --> 2762.4900000000002
so what macaroni space pictures

2753.13 --> 2764.9700000000003
did you help fabricate even mister the

2762.49 --> 2764.97
heathen

2772.859 --> 2778.71
what's wrong with it Laurie well that it

2776.38 --> 2782.17
doesn't make any damn sense and

2778.71 --> 2785.489
everything it proposes is absolutely

2782.17 --> 2788.9700000000003
ridiculous and has huge consequences

2785.489 --> 2794.529
mechanically that are just absolutely

2788.97 --> 2798.249
not accounted for in reality that's

2794.529 --> 2806.259
what's wrong with the seasonal system on

2798.249 --> 2810.279
the globe search echo would I call

2806.259 --> 2812.789
myself a scientist well I do dabble a

2810.279 --> 2815.799
little in the scientific method I

2812.789 --> 2818.309
figured out the relative density theory

2815.799 --> 2824.2889999999998
I've refined it in that science

2818.309 --> 2826.9
absolutely so I would be very careful to

2824.289 --> 2828.6400000000003
avoid miss applying the scientific

2826.9 --> 2831.9700000000003
method and claiming science for

2828.64 --> 2834.3089999999997
something I hey I might look earlier

2831.97 --> 2837.759
like for example when I still believe in

2834.309 --> 2839.579
gravity I saw that as science because I

2837.759 --> 2842.46
was convinced now there must be a way

2839.579 --> 2848.349
that's yeah just part of the journey

2842.46 --> 2851.16
waking up what is real but I guess you

2848.349 --> 2855.9100000000003
could call me a scientist but yeah whoo

2851.16 --> 2857.92
reputation yeah I very little to put on

2855.91 --> 2861.009
my reputation other than dabbling in the

2857.92 --> 2863.799
relative density theory and yeah the

2861.009 --> 2864.46
faculties as I present them just what I

2863.799 --> 2874.96
can do

2864.46 --> 2878.4700000000003
that's it but you know maybe I could do

2874.96 --> 2883.42
some more of that I'm definitely open to

2878.47 --> 2886.0589999999997
it I use it as a guideline of like off

2883.42 --> 2888.549
spiritual sobriety really that is what

2886.059 --> 2893.71
the scientific method more symbolizes to

2888.549 --> 2895.93
me rather than just being apps obsessed

2893.71 --> 2900.099
up with applying it it is really like

2895.93 --> 2903.73
just to keep it straight like what's so

2900.099 --> 2905.92
you don't dwell off in presupposition

2903.73 --> 2907.9
nonsense that is really what the

2905.92 --> 2918.16
scientific method is for in my opinion

2907.9 --> 2921.21
that's how it feels to me oh my god who

2918.16 --> 2921.21
is this guy

2921.33 --> 2930.609
explain wind can't see yet it's

2926.02 --> 2934.24
measurable same as gravity oh my god so

2930.609 --> 2937.359
you've never you've never seen the Flat

2934.24 --> 2940.1699999999996
Earth debate you've never watched more

2937.359 --> 2944.5299999999997
than this show or did you forget it all

2940.17 --> 2947.53
have you gone into an amnesia response

2944.53 --> 2951.0600000000004
the hidden because everything you say is

2947.53 --> 2954.2400000000002
absolutely [ __ ] every single piece

2951.06 --> 2960.19
what you put down there is so so

2954.24 --> 2963.0099999999998
absolutely stupid because ya winds are

2960.19 --> 2965.77
very easy to explain there's just

2963.01 --> 2968.9500000000003
constant heat being subjected to the

2965.77 --> 2971.38
ground that transforms into heat there's

2968.95 --> 2973.99
gas is gonna escape because of that that

2971.38 --> 2975.2200000000003
are normally not because it's a little

2973.99 --> 2977.1699999999996
bit too cold for it

2975.22 --> 2979.5699999999997
gases go around there's going to be

2977.17 --> 2982.81
pressure as water moist going to be

2979.57 --> 2985.15
pressure that's gonna make a pressure

2982.81 --> 2987.64
change in the regions as to where it is

2985.15 --> 2989.71
warm and gas is created and where it's

2987.64 --> 2991.0899999999997
cooling down and where it's settling and

2989.71 --> 2994.42
lowering the pressure so there's be

2991.09 --> 2997.15
gonna be constant motion because the

2994.42 --> 3000.06
Earth's realm is a dynamic system the

2997.15 --> 3005.06
gas within it is dynamic there's always

3000.06 --> 3009.869
motion because the sunlight is always

3005.06 --> 3012.09
always heating up some parts of the

3009.869 --> 3014.94
earth and it's changing its position so

3012.09 --> 3017.88
there's a constant heat changing with it

3014.94 --> 3020.94
comes a constant pressure change so yes

3017.88 --> 3026.88
there will always be winds because of

3020.94 --> 3029.67
that so that's number one okay you can

3026.88 --> 3032.6400000000003
see it's a mystery with gravity yeah

3029.67 --> 3033.69
same as gravity really you can't see it

3032.64 --> 3036.42
but it's measurable

3033.69 --> 3036.93
no no it's assumable you don't measure

3036.42 --> 3041.13
any

3036.93 --> 3043.41
about gravity you only assume it it must

3041.13 --> 3046.17
be there because of some calculus

3043.41 --> 3050.0099999999998
deduction based system that Newton

3046.17 --> 3054.2400000000002
created so it became a like a calculus

3050.01 --> 3057.42
law within his framework system that you

3054.24 --> 3059.5499999999997
have to assume gravity because of a lack

3057.42 --> 3062.2200000000003
of better explanation for it at the time

3059.55 --> 3063.9900000000002
even though he was very clear about it

3062.22 --> 3067.2599999999998
was not scientific that's why he never

3063.99 --> 3071.339
claimed hypotheses for gravitation

3067.26 --> 3075.2700000000004
officially noted right so it's not

3071.339 --> 3076.859
measurable it's assumable but yeah if

3075.27 --> 3079.55
you're gonna go but what about these

3076.859 --> 3084.089
effects what about the acceleration rate

3079.55 --> 3087.21
what about things falling mm-hmm

3084.089 --> 3090.569
well that's all based on relative

3087.21 --> 3094.319
density differential between the density

3090.569 --> 3097.98
of an object or a fluid within another

3094.319 --> 3102.27
fluid if the density of the object is

3097.98 --> 3105.299
higher than the fluid it will displace

3102.27 --> 3107.67
it force will be subjected because of

3105.299 --> 3109.829
the relative density disequilibrium of

3107.67 --> 3113.76
the object with the surroundings and

3109.829 --> 3118.9500000000003
will be subjected to go if it is higher

3113.76 --> 3120.599
than its medium downwards and that is in

3118.95 --> 3124.2
the form of a force being applied

3120.599 --> 3127.26
causing acceleration being subjected to

3124.2 --> 3130.1899999999996
the friction of the medium and then if

3127.26 --> 3134.369
at some point it can no longer move

3130.19 --> 3137.849
because it's being kept or held up by

3134.369 --> 3141.42
something then well it will still be

3137.849 --> 3144.089
surrounded by a medium that is lighter

3141.42 --> 3146.579
in density so it still will want to go

3144.089 --> 3150.599
that direction but because it can't move

3146.579 --> 3153.17
any more now certainly it will translate

3150.599 --> 3155.4
into pressure instead it will just push

3153.17 --> 3158.819
towards the direction that it wants to

3155.4 --> 3162.53
go now if the object would be surrounded

3158.819 --> 3166.65
by a medium that is of its own density

3162.53 --> 3169.1090000000004
that push it's not gonna well it is in a

3166.65 --> 3170.609
way gonna work the same if that whole

3169.109 --> 3174.18
material

3170.609 --> 3176.519
be in a giant bucket or something

3174.18 --> 3178.0789999999997
surrounded by arrogant because if it's

3176.519 --> 3182.279
surrounded by air it's still gonna be

3178.079 --> 3185.4300000000003
it's still gonna go down but hey if it's

3182.279 --> 3188.88
surrounded by a very heavy liquid it's

3185.43 --> 3192.5989999999997
not gonna be stuck it's gonna float in

3188.88 --> 3194.609
it it's gonna find its relative density

3192.599 --> 3197.509
point within the medium as it is

3194.609 --> 3201.089
surrounded try to find the exact average

3197.509 --> 3203.759
because it is in equilibrium with its

3201.089 --> 3205.2
direct surroundings that is relative

3203.759 --> 3208.529
density that is real that is

3205.2 --> 3215.009
scientifically provable that explains

3208.529 --> 3217.589
all all the effects relating to gravity

3215.009 --> 3221.029
even the supposed zero-g can be

3217.589 --> 3224.549
explained through the system everything

3221.029 --> 3227.73
everything everything relating to

3224.549 --> 3231.029
gravity concerning displacement on the

3227.73 --> 3234.72
earth even in a complex setting can be

3231.029 --> 3243.799
explained this way relative density

3234.72 --> 3247.4889999999996
theory so mister at 26 years

3243.799 --> 3247.489
pseudoscience got any more

3258.55 --> 3265.1600000000003
mmm yeah you couldn't even follow that

3262.58 --> 3267.5
hey Ethan yeah I know this league what

3265.16 --> 3270.8199999999997
the [ __ ] is he talking about yes

3267.5 --> 3273.53
its scientific provable theory

3270.82 --> 3275.21
confirmable scientific theory that is

3273.53 --> 3278.3900000000003
what I was talking about it is the

3275.21 --> 3283.6
alternate explanation for your very

3278.39 --> 3286.16
sloppy presuppositional gravity

3283.6 --> 3294.2
unscientific nobody claims scientific

3286.16 --> 3297.23
theory right gravity big G doesn't exist

3294.2 --> 3299.4199999999996
it's an aberration it's a fake construct

3297.23 --> 3302.15
relative density isn't real it's

3299.42 --> 3304.19
provable anyone can test that everything

3302.15 --> 3305.57
concerning gravity can be explained

3304.19 --> 3308.06
through a relative density without

3305.57 --> 3313.36
exception it doesn't explain the

3308.06 --> 3318.19
directions those are just what they are

3313.36 --> 3324.71
it's very obvious how it works and

3318.19 --> 3326.18
that's it it's in a realm relative

3324.71 --> 3331.25
density that's how it works

3326.18 --> 3334.04
and yeah I expect a full report in the

3331.25 --> 3337.07
morning and I better get good grades

3334.04 --> 3339.71
because this is probably gonna be part

3337.07 --> 3346.54
of physics exam in about 10 years

3339.71 --> 3349.9700000000003
standard so I'm gonna round out the show

3346.54 --> 3351.5
thanks everyone for coming if you liked

3349.97 --> 3352.79
this show then please don't forget to

3351.5 --> 3354.56
upload it and if you haven't already

3352.79 --> 3356.15
subscribe to my channel and hit the bell

3354.56 --> 3358.37
notification so you know when I'm going

3356.15 --> 3361.7000000000003
live which is normally 2:00 p.m. after

3358.37 --> 3363.44
damn time every day and please also do

3361.7 --> 3366.41
support my channel through the Pay Pal

3363.44 --> 3367.75
patreon oh my go fund me and the super

3366.41 --> 3369.89
chat that would be much appreciated

3367.75 --> 3375.05
still need your help on the long run

3369.89 --> 3378.68
doing good for now oh by the way it was

3375.05 --> 3380.8100000000004
very odd it wasn't I got I got the paper

3378.68 --> 3385.2
with explaining what it was it's

3380.81 --> 3388.6
something extremely unexpected and weird

3385.2 --> 3390.9399999999996
it was not money back from Google

3388.6 --> 3397.62
through taxes it was something from way

3390.94 --> 3401.5
ago so it's like a woman okay somebody

3397.62 --> 3403.5699999999997
found a little lost thingy

3401.5 --> 3408.67
somewhere in there my taxes apparently

3403.57 --> 3411.1200000000003
from five years ago okay anyway I got

3408.67 --> 3411.12
lucky with that

3418.47 --> 3430.1099999999997
Wow what I just got a notification from

3426.63 --> 3434.2000000000003
YouTube that Nathan went live

3430.11 --> 3442.2400000000002
then I go to it and it says streamed

3434.2 --> 3446.2
live on 26 September 2019 well thanks

3442.24 --> 3448.81
thanks YouTube thanks so much for the

3446.2 --> 3451.1499999999996
notification that's just amazing here

3448.81 --> 3452.74
