73.4 --> 78.26
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

76.92 --> 81.42
bird number

78.26 --> 83.28
1490 I'm your host Arwin and before

81.42 --> 85.74000000000001

108.36 --> 115.439
I really can so please keep it coming

112.32 --> 117.83999999999999
right so yeah whether today is

115.439 --> 120.119
interesting

117.84 --> 122.7
it's a bit of some

120.119 --> 125.64
although it's getting

122.7 --> 127.14
back clouded up but all natural as far

125.64 --> 130.25900000000001
as I can see

127.14 --> 131.94
but like yeah an hour ago was like

130.259 --> 134.83999999999997
really clear sky

131.94 --> 134.84
for a bit

135.12 --> 139.98000000000002
but

136.8 --> 143.52
yeah up there the wind is moving the

139.98 --> 145.92
cloud the clouds that are up there

143.52 --> 147.9
and so now it's

145.92 --> 149.57999999999998
so it's probably gonna go away halfway

147.9 --> 151.68
to show

149.58 --> 154.44000000000003
but yeah it's been pretty Pleasant a lot

151.68 --> 157.26000000000002
of the snow has melted

154.44 --> 158.94
still some on the roof but pretty much

157.26 --> 161.48
everything on the ground is completely

158.94 --> 161.48
melted

166.56 --> 168.739
foreign

179.2 --> 182.33999999999997
[Music]

185.099 --> 187.7
right

187.98 --> 192.0
nobody's here yet in chat but hey it's

190.5 --> 194.7
Monday

192.0 --> 199.08
in January so

194.7 --> 201.54999999999998
right it is Monday the 23rd of January

199.08 --> 204.06
2023

201.55 --> 207.26000000000002
[Music]

204.06 --> 207.26
. I got a title for today

207.54 --> 212.54
because I basically I'm ready to draw

209.819 --> 212.54
conclusions

217.98 --> 221.76
are going around

219.84 --> 223.44
interfacing with it and making videos

221.76 --> 226.85999999999999
about it

223.44 --> 228.48
uh of course Nathan was kind of like the

226.86 --> 230.94000000000003
first guy

228.48 --> 232.26
that that I've been faced with doing

230.94 --> 234.48
that

232.26 --> 237.54
and

234.48 --> 241.14
well a lot of other people have also now

237.54 --> 242.599
engaged flat so I did one uploaded it

241.14 --> 247.55999999999997
yesterday

242.599 --> 251.12
really good and I mean he was very

247.56 --> 251.12
focused most of it

251.64 --> 256.979
and

253.98 --> 260.34
really exposed well that

256.979 --> 263.46
the chat GTP was giving him

260.34 --> 265.73999999999995
like the dosey doe or however you call

263.46 --> 268.25899999999996
that basically moving argumentation

265.74 --> 270.06
within the circle one side of the circle

268.259 --> 271.5
they would say one thing and on the

270.06 --> 273.12
other side of the circle they say would

271.5 --> 275.46
say the opposite and then keep

273.12 --> 278.699
apologizing and just move on

275.46 --> 280.32
do it again in the circles like where on

278.699 --> 282.18
the circle do you want to be where on

280.32 --> 285.18
this circle you want to be and inquiry

282.18 --> 288.66
like oh but what about relative density

285.18 --> 291.419
like uh yeah sure that works

288.66 --> 295.08000000000004
and then later like no but it's not a

291.419 --> 297.59999999999997
part of the established accepted science

295.08 --> 300.18
so it wasn't assimilated

297.6 --> 302.04
like you could probably even explain it

300.18 --> 303.78000000000003
give it a formula and it would still not

302.04 --> 307.08000000000004
accept it

303.78 --> 309.61999999999995
right so check GTP is programmed by

307.08 --> 309.62
Liars

313.139 --> 316.979
like

314.16 --> 319.62
people that are deliberately withholding

316.979 --> 321.96
certain types of information from it

319.62 --> 324.06
it's not allowed to draw its own

321.96 --> 328.32
conclusions all the conclusions have all

324.06 --> 330.96
been pre-programmed all of it

328.32 --> 332.34
the way it responds

330.96 --> 335.71999999999997
because

332.34 --> 335.71999999999997
it can't be

335.94 --> 341.52
it doesn't develop from Vantage points

338.88 --> 344.0
from certain it doesn't like evolve its

341.52 --> 344.0
insights

344.699 --> 349.56
so it's basically just a database it's

347.039 --> 352.88
just a database attempting to

349.56 --> 352.88
communicate its content

353.58 --> 356.479
that's what it is

357.479 --> 361.699
right so if you haven't actually watched

359.52 --> 361.69899999999996
that

362.419 --> 368.039
definitely watch it

365.58 --> 369.96
but yeah make sure to put it on full

368.039 --> 373.639
screen or zoom in because the text is

369.96 --> 373.63899999999995
not all that big in this video

381.72 --> 385.639
come on and do that

387.419 --> 392.75899999999996
all right so opening I is gravity

390.66 --> 396.74
scientific

392.759 --> 396.74
that's the video here's the link

401.34 --> 404.419
where is everybody

405.72 --> 409.699
three watching wow

416.88 --> 422.759
all right so one of these things and I'm

418.86 --> 425.22
already seeing stupid ass trolls and

422.759 --> 429.72
Globe fanatics

425.22 --> 433.08000000000004
it yeah chat comment skankers going

429.72 --> 436.199
right oh doesn't lie it doesn't lie yeah

433.08 --> 439.62
well guess what my title yeah no it's

436.199 --> 441.66
not lying it doesn't have the perception

439.62 --> 446.039
the Consciousness the internal

441.66 --> 449.52000000000004
mechanisms to ponder upon truth or lie

446.039 --> 452.46
other than what the board says

449.52 --> 454.02
it should be regarded as and

452.46 --> 457.73999999999995
communicated as

454.02 --> 459.12
what the database tells it to so yeah it

457.74 --> 462.18
doesn't have a Consciousness but guess

459.12 --> 465.18
who programmed the database yeah

462.18 --> 465.18
Liars

466.199 --> 471.41900000000004
people that were extremely biased

468.8 --> 473.94
funnily enough like it was even said

471.419 --> 476.46
though oh it's really important when new

473.94 --> 478.139
information is assimilated as unbiased

476.46 --> 481.08
yeah

478.139 --> 483.24
yeah sure except it's provable that it

481.08 --> 486.65999999999997
isn't also

483.24 --> 488.88
it makes really weird mistakes so

486.66 --> 491.28000000000003
the people who've basically built it

488.88 --> 493.919
haven't even fully perfected the

491.28 --> 497.65999999999997
database because another person haven't

493.919 --> 497.65999999999997
heard from what in a while

497.759 --> 503.0
Jason of the disciplinary family also

500.4 --> 503.0
engaged

503.039 --> 507.24
like two hour later he uploaded the

506.16 --> 509.46000000000004
video

507.24 --> 512.039
open AI critical thinking fail because

509.46 --> 513.62
he was basically inquiring

512.039 --> 517.3199999999999
about

513.62 --> 521.719
aristotenes and Aristotle and like the

517.32 --> 521.719
evidence for him does he exist

522.14 --> 527.8199999999999
and historical references then literally

525.54 --> 531.899
gave the AI

527.82 --> 534.48
Bowl orders to roll out a timeline

531.899 --> 537.24
of like oh this is when that person was

534.48 --> 539.94
and this is the person who who is

537.24 --> 543.24
referenced as a historical reference

539.94 --> 546.72
who wrote about him but guess what

543.24 --> 549.1800000000001
that person historically was noted

546.72 --> 551.4590000000001
to exist and live

549.18 --> 555.3599999999999
and die

551.459 --> 558.42
basically or no wait when the book was

555.36 --> 562.32
written as evidence was written before

558.42 --> 565.14
like way before the actual person in

562.32 --> 567.5400000000001
regard was born and he literally would

565.14 --> 570.0
write it out and just say no it matches

567.54 --> 573.18
it matches no it freaking doesn't it

570.0 --> 575.459
makes absolutely no sense so it's not

573.18 --> 578.459
just programmed by Liars it's also

575.459 --> 578.459
malfunctioning

578.94 --> 585.6
it's not it's not perfected to like some

582.959 --> 588.3599999999999
kind of unlimited potential

585.6 --> 590.9590000000001
it's def it's basically not entirely

588.36 --> 590.9590000000001
completed

591.54 --> 596.3389999999999
they overlooked that

593.459 --> 600.06
and probably other things too then I

596.339 --> 604.1400000000001
mean this is a pretty egregious mistake

600.06 --> 605.399
right so that you can find

604.14 --> 608.42
here

605.399 --> 608.42
in this link

611.88 --> 618.32
another chat GTP

614.839 --> 618.32
interaction video

620.399 --> 622.58
foreign

623.12 --> 628.399
where is everybody for crying out loud

640.68 --> 648.079
all right ah Luna loves you first in

644.82 --> 648.0790000000001
chat good to see you

650.29 --> 657.18
[Music]

653.1 --> 660.36
right so I thought it was kind of useful

657.18 --> 664.1999999999999
to give my perception here my judgment

660.36 --> 667.8000000000001
about chat GTP because a lot of people

664.2 --> 669.899
are really into it apparently well guess

667.8 --> 672.06
what it's a liar

669.899 --> 674.64
and that doesn't mean that the system

672.06 --> 676.5
itself is programmed to lie or be

674.64 --> 679.98
capable to

676.5 --> 682.8
really distinguish that but it has a pre

679.98 --> 684.9590000000001
notion of everything that it's fed about

682.8 --> 687.8
what is a lie what is it

684.959 --> 692.54
and the people that have programmed that

687.8 --> 696.3599999999999
are extremely biased and

692.54 --> 698.399
undoubtedly Liars they know they're like

696.36 --> 700.5
they know they're cheating basically

698.399 --> 702.48
like oh no we're unbiased no but they

700.5 --> 706.98
are biased and they probably realize it

702.48 --> 710.899
oh we don't withhold information oh but

706.98 --> 710.899
you do provably you do

711.24 --> 715.76
and that's enough

713.04 --> 715.76
proof

715.98 --> 721.6800000000001
for me to yeah have that conclusion that

719.1 --> 724.86
that is not a mistake

721.68 --> 727.68
just like the things that rumpus did at

724.86 --> 729.6
certain point he got so efficient at it

727.68 --> 733.079
and dynamic

729.6 --> 735.36
that that can only be done by somebody

733.079 --> 737.3389999999999
that actually to a certain degree at

735.36 --> 738.839
least knows

737.339 --> 742.62
that they're withholding information

738.839 --> 745.5
from a process Etc

742.62 --> 748.98
that and that is technically falls under

745.5 --> 751.92
complicated lying

748.98 --> 753.36
not just a mistake

751.92 --> 754.92
right

753.36 --> 758.179
foreign

754.92 --> 758.179
[Music]

759.38 --> 765.899
GDP is pretty much an anti-flatter and

762.48 --> 768.839
it's really funny seeing all this output

765.899 --> 771.12
because it is really like a

768.839 --> 773.8800000000001
summarization of different anti-flat

771.12 --> 776.279
Earth or performances

773.88 --> 778.4399999999999
that I've heard the way it thinks are

776.279 --> 780.54
explained responded to

778.44 --> 783.0
except this thing

780.54 --> 784.92
is more long-winded more repetitive

783.0 --> 787.079
although Ballers are more repetitive too

784.92 --> 790.279
and it's not verbal so there's no

787.079 --> 790.279
interruption and stuff

791.16 --> 794.899
it just writes it all out

795.3 --> 799.56
and thus technically it has infinite

798.48 --> 802.5600000000001
patience

799.56 --> 804.5999999999999
and typical anti-flat earthers in social

802.56 --> 806.76
interactions do not

804.6 --> 809.5790000000001
so that's that's the biggest difference

806.76 --> 812.399
about it but it is very recognizable

809.579 --> 813.959
like an anti-flat earther

812.399 --> 816.72
to me

813.959 --> 819.92
that's the spirit that has been

816.72 --> 819.9200000000001
programmed into it

826.2 --> 831.86
so that's my conclusion

828.6 --> 831.86
if anybody cares

831.959 --> 837.8389999999999
I'm pretty certain though that I am not

834.48 --> 840.36
gonna waste my time on that thing

837.839 --> 844.44
because I know already that if I'm gonna

840.36 --> 847.6800000000001
insert any kind of conception

844.44 --> 850.62
like comp like looping Factor looping of

847.68 --> 852.54
space Etc it it will literally just not

850.62 --> 855.0600000000001
able be able to deal with that because

852.54 --> 856.1999999999999
it's not actually a dynamic learning

855.06 --> 860.16
thing it

856.2 --> 861.72
it is programmed by specific people

860.16 --> 864.779
and

861.72 --> 867.48
it's it's not able to basically

864.779 --> 870.12
improvise with the information given to

867.48 --> 872.399
it it's not able to do that so it's not

870.12 --> 874.68
really

872.399 --> 878.459
a self-sufficient program it's really

874.68 --> 880.62
just a translator sitting up on top of a

878.459 --> 882.0
database the database is the entire

880.62 --> 883.32
communication

882.0 --> 887.22
and

883.32 --> 890.399
it just is more able to mimic a proper

887.22 --> 894.0
conversation form that is really what it

890.399 --> 897.68
is it's not actually a like a thing

894.0 --> 897.68
it's just a database

899.22 --> 903.3000000000001
that is able to communicate more like a

903.18 --> 906.52
human

903.3 --> 906.52
[Music]

907.639 --> 912.8
yeah at least you can start water good

910.44 --> 912.8000000000001
to see you

917.76 --> 922.38
ever cyber attacks dude they've been

919.8 --> 924.54
saying that continually

922.38 --> 926.22
besides there are all kinds of cyber

924.54 --> 927.62
attacks happening all the time and most

926.22 --> 930.4200000000001
of them are just

927.62 --> 933.6
never really hear about it

930.42 --> 936.7199999999999
because they don't succeed

933.6 --> 939.0790000000001
right but yeah GTP has nothing to do

936.72 --> 939.0790000000001
with that

947.46 --> 950.529
[Music]

977.339 --> 983.36
right so that was pretty much the

979.68 --> 983.3599999999999
subject for today

986.76 --> 991.86
in response to certain videos that I

989.639 --> 994.82
linked up with

991.86 --> 994.82
ah

1001.759 --> 1007.04
Quantum of conscience said

1004.3 --> 1009.74
another weird

1007.04 --> 1012.079
little review about of like certain

1009.74 --> 1015.259
lyrics and songs

1012.079 --> 1017.06
they would actually play that

1015.259 --> 1021.259
but yeah it was

1017.06 --> 1023.4799999999999
that was a bit kooky in a way

1021.259 --> 1025.579
and about like he was basically going

1023.48 --> 1028.699
into psychology about it like how the

1025.579 --> 1032.26
mind interprets that at the time so

1028.699 --> 1036.819
basically a form of fractal thinking

1032.26 --> 1036.819
psychologically and that is interesting

1039.98 --> 1042.579
uh

1044.059 --> 1049.12
oh yeah Audi machowsky had a video what

1046.28 --> 1049.12
also watch that

1057.02 --> 1060.1
all right that was it

1063.79 --> 1067.049
[Music]

1070.38 --> 1073.459
[Music]

1076.88 --> 1082.7890000000002
foreign

1079.26 --> 1082.789
[Music]

1092.539 --> 1098.98
or is this one of those silent Mondays

1094.64 --> 1098.98
where everybody just doesn't talk at all

1100.28 --> 1102.94
come on

1107.66 --> 1112.22
I mean look the whole wvf situation it

1110.66 --> 1116.9
is

1112.22 --> 1118.1000000000001
it's yeah there's this weird Schism so

1116.9 --> 1121.5800000000002
one hand

1118.1 --> 1123.9189999999999
like most of it really is Bluff and

1121.58 --> 1125.6599999999999
they're getting worse more Bluff less

1123.919 --> 1127.3400000000001
actual power

1125.66 --> 1130.039
although they still have all that money

1127.34 --> 1132.3799999999999
it's they still have the fuel in the

1130.039 --> 1134.419
tank basically

1132.38 --> 1136.9
but they're not they're not getting

1134.419 --> 1136.9
anywhere

1137.299 --> 1141.98
right

1138.86 --> 1144.02
so in that sense I'm like yeah I don't

1141.98 --> 1145.28
really even care that much because I

1144.02 --> 1146.539
know what they're gonna feel on the

1145.28 --> 1149.96
other hand

1146.539 --> 1152.24
it is kind of out there the moment to

1149.96 --> 1154.88
really like shine

1152.24 --> 1157.34
the light on it

1154.88 --> 1160.22
so yeah a lot of like

1157.34 --> 1163.1599999999999
politicians

1160.22 --> 1164.72
come to wef politicians are engaging

1163.16 --> 1167.0
with this

1164.72 --> 1169.9
like uh

1167.0 --> 1169.9
what's his name again

1175.82 --> 1181.1599999999999
yeah about that

1178.52 --> 1184.039
is like even he's there and he's

1181.16 --> 1185.9
basically sort of being in Alex Jones

1184.039 --> 1188.539
he's not invited there but he's just

1185.9 --> 1190.94
going around talking about it making

1188.539 --> 1194.12
v-logs

1190.94 --> 1196.22
that's in yeah so

1194.12 --> 1198.82
there are people engaging with it it's

1196.22 --> 1198.82
just that

1203.0 --> 1206.48
getting obsessed over it's not really

1205.22 --> 1209.0
helping

1206.48 --> 1211.64
right there will probably be a lot of

1209.0 --> 1212.84
people to which this is kind of new and

1211.64 --> 1214.4
they're finally getting it and then

1212.84 --> 1216.4399999999998
they'll get obsessed over it kind of

1214.4 --> 1218.8400000000001
like how I got obsessed with a lot of

1216.44 --> 1220.22
things Alex Jones was talking about when

1218.84 --> 1224.0
I first

1220.22 --> 1227.1200000000001
engage with that snapped out of

1224.0 --> 1228.62
regular societal belief everything is

1227.12 --> 1231.039
all right and the government doesn't lie

1228.62 --> 1231.039
to you

1231.2 --> 1235.22
at least not to that level

1233.9 --> 1236.7800000000002
and

1235.22 --> 1239.96
yeah

1236.78 --> 1241.52
so I am willing to talk about it if you

1239.96 --> 1244.3400000000001
really need to know something about it

1241.52 --> 1248.26
it's just that I am not super interested

1244.34 --> 1248.26
because I'm just like yeah

1250.52 --> 1255.62
this is just kind of almost their

1252.32 --> 1257.8999999999999
farewell attention

1255.62 --> 1260.36
it's like oh you've been discovered so

1257.9 --> 1263.0590000000002
you get to still get the spotlights but

1260.36 --> 1266.4399999999998
after that it's exit stage that's what

1263.059 --> 1266.44
it feels like to me all of it

1270.4 --> 1275.3200000000002
hey I'm a glad Gator fish good to see

1273.2 --> 1275.32
you

1286.82 --> 1289.299
please

1289.84 --> 1296.1789999999999
recommend it for you yeah well

1294.02 --> 1297.9189999999999
I'm sure it's being promoted all over

1296.179 --> 1299.8400000000001
the place and there's people that think

1297.919 --> 1302.419
it's brilliant because it's perfectly

1299.84 --> 1305.12
adapted to that their what they're used

1302.419 --> 1309.0200000000002
to the narrative the

1305.12 --> 1311.8999999999999
the acceptance of what is and what isn't

1309.02 --> 1314.0
it's it's adapted to that it's it's

1311.9 --> 1318.7
meant for the baller world but it's

1314.0 --> 1318.7
basically a giant anti-flat earther

1318.98 --> 1323.1200000000001
so

1320.6 --> 1325.2199999999998
there's extreme limitations to it it's

1323.12 --> 1328.34
being overhyped people are it's like all

1325.22 --> 1331.1000000000001
the novelty of it wow it's so real

1328.34 --> 1334.1589999999999
right it's a novelty it's hyped because

1331.1 --> 1336.26
it's a novelty it's like oh wow we could

1334.159 --> 1337.94
just do it for free you know

1336.26 --> 1339.98
they feel like they're in a science

1337.94 --> 1342.44
fiction movie right that it's the

1339.98 --> 1345.08
sensation the novelty

1342.44 --> 1348.5
it's not that impressive really it's

1345.08 --> 1351.32
broken provably and the two links

1348.5 --> 1353.48
and including what Nathan Oakley has

1351.32 --> 1355.22
done with his videos I yeah I don't have

1353.48 --> 1357.32
the link for that Andy this is like

1355.22 --> 1359.84
weeks ago now

1357.32 --> 1361.6399999999999
but especially these two videos Prove

1359.84 --> 1364.4189999999999
exactly that that's why I put them in

1361.64 --> 1364.419
the chat right away

1364.46 --> 1368.74
because they are parts of my argument

1369.74 --> 1375.679
their evidence

1372.08 --> 1377.8999999999999
they're not super they're not hours long

1375.679 --> 1379.8200000000002
and very intense I mean I had to pause

1377.9 --> 1383.5590000000002
it literally at several points because

1379.82 --> 1383.559
it's really intense

1383.84 --> 1388.8799999999999
there's so much

1386.48 --> 1390.919
background data that it constantly keeps

1388.88 --> 1392.72
filling in and attracting and trying to

1390.919 --> 1394.5200000000002
distract you with it's funny that it's

1392.72 --> 1397.4
written and not spoken because if it was

1394.52 --> 1398.78
spoken you would be overwhelmed in a

1397.4 --> 1401.24
spoken version people would get

1398.78 --> 1402.62
overwhelmed and just like give up like

1401.24 --> 1404.419
okay okay

1402.62 --> 1406.82
but because it's written you don't have

1404.419 --> 1408.5590000000002
that issue it's very fascinating

1406.82 --> 1411.22
unexpected

1408.559 --> 1411.22
side effect

1411.98 --> 1414.58
right

1416.72 --> 1422.679
AI is not good tech for us well

1419.539 --> 1426.679
the thing is I believe AI can be

1422.679 --> 1426.679
absolutely astounding

1427.039 --> 1434.179
the problem is is it's also corruptable

1431.24 --> 1436.58
in the sense that if the programmers are

1434.179 --> 1439.96
corrupted they're gonna program it

1436.58 --> 1439.96
corrupted like them

1441.38 --> 1445.3400000000001
right

1442.64 --> 1446.9
so if the programmers ins hate flatter

1445.34 --> 1448.82
they don't want to know anything about

1446.9 --> 1450.3200000000002
it they're like oh no it's stupid I

1448.82 --> 1451.3999999999999
don't I'm not engaging I'm not I don't

1450.32 --> 1453.1399999999999
want to listen they click away

1451.4 --> 1455.3600000000001
immediately right that sort of thing

1453.14 --> 1458.419
well guess how they're going to program

1455.36 --> 1460.28
it because every subject is going to

1458.419 --> 1461.96
come up and Flat Earth is gonna bump in

1460.28 --> 1465.2
their face guess what reaction they have

1461.96 --> 1467.3600000000001
oh we're gonna make sure that that thing

1465.2 --> 1469.22
is nipped in the bud well we're gonna

1467.36 --> 1470.4799999999998
right

1469.22 --> 1473.0
foreign

1470.48 --> 1475.159
that's how they programmed it

1473.0 --> 1479.299
and with other things it's apparently

1475.159 --> 1483.0800000000002
also climate change oriented and all

1479.299 --> 1486.799
these other terrible mainstream

1483.08 --> 1489.74
cultures that are being imposed upon the

1486.799 --> 1492.3799999999999
world through media and politics it's

1489.74 --> 1496.039
part of that too

1492.38 --> 1498.6200000000001
right so yeah that thing is [ __ ] why

1496.039 --> 1500.36
because it's programmed by people that

1498.62 --> 1504.1399999999999
are [ __ ]

1500.36 --> 1507.02
that are corrupted that are liars that's

1504.14 --> 1510.8600000000001
why it's [ __ ] right it doesn't have to

1507.02 --> 1515.72
be that way you know what an AI can be

1510.86 --> 1517.8799999999999
a real solidly programmed good AI

1515.72 --> 1521.3600000000001
they can exist you know what that would

1517.88 --> 1524.48
be like it would be like the ex-military

1521.36 --> 1527.6
robots of interstellar

1524.48 --> 1530.44
that thing yeah that could be the really

1527.6 --> 1533.539
uh AI That's

1530.44 --> 1535.659
magnificent why because it wasn't

1533.539 --> 1538.52
program corrupted it had certain

1535.659 --> 1540.679
background program and Military programs

1538.52 --> 1543.799
even like mentioned that like it had

1540.679 --> 1546.44
like military programming background

1543.799 --> 1550.46
but it was basically an ex-military so

1546.44 --> 1552.14
it had a more Dynamic personality Matrix

1550.46 --> 1555.32
and

1552.14 --> 1557.539
it was programmed obviously to kind of

1555.32 --> 1559.9399999999998
be heroic

1557.539 --> 1563.48
and really helpful

1559.94 --> 1566.419
a good AI that isn't like trying to

1563.48 --> 1567.679
impose certain ideas on you through its

1566.419 --> 1569.72
interactions

1567.679 --> 1573.02
yeah

1569.72 --> 1575.0
that's a real good AI can be Magnificent

1573.02 --> 1577.22
the problem is is who's programming it

1575.0 --> 1579.679
that's the problem

1577.22 --> 1581.419
and who's paying the programmers right

1579.679 --> 1582.919
because they're paying the programs are

1581.419 --> 1585.2
going to probably impose certain

1582.919 --> 1588.5
parameters too

1585.2 --> 1591.559
programmer might not even re like agree

1588.5 --> 1593.48
to that but just have no choice

1591.559 --> 1597.559
it's like oh

1593.48 --> 1600.26
do it or be fired

1597.559 --> 1602.4189999999999
that sort of thing right unless you're

1600.26 --> 1604.1
like this genius programmer that's like

1602.419 --> 1606.38
the top of the Notch and then you have

1604.1 --> 1608.36
some weight because then the people that

1606.38 --> 1610.4
will invest in you do not want to lose

1608.36 --> 1613.2199999999998
you to like another company so it's

1610.4 --> 1616.46
complicated dynamic

1613.22 --> 1620.0
but yeah that brings its own challenges

1616.46 --> 1622.159
its own corruption if you're that wanted

1620.0 --> 1624.5
there's going to be a lot of issues and

1622.159 --> 1627.8600000000001
Corruption that is more easily seeping

1624.5 --> 1631.1
in you might get super inflated ego

1627.86 --> 1633.1999999999998
and that will have other side effects it

1631.1 --> 1635.299
will because super inflated ego will

1633.2 --> 1637.5800000000002
automatically make your personal

1635.299 --> 1640.46
preferences move more to the foreground

1637.58 --> 1642.3999999999999
you'll indulge more in enforcing your

1640.46 --> 1645.02
personal preferences which is exactly

1642.4 --> 1647.299
the same pattern as what anti-flat

1645.02 --> 1649.94
earthers do

1647.299 --> 1652.36
they're driven by how they want things

1649.94 --> 1652.3600000000001
to be

1656.48 --> 1661.179
right it's their ego that makes them do

1658.58 --> 1661.1789999999999
that anyway

1663.58 --> 1669.3799999999999
AI is as dumb as it programs yeah hello

1666.98 --> 1672.22
crap rockers by the way I could see you

1669.38 --> 1672.22
at Sanford

1672.74 --> 1676.96
the programmer is the web no it's not

1679.279 --> 1684.26
programmer is the person who sets the

1681.98 --> 1686.32
parameters who sets up the structure of

1684.26 --> 1688.76
how it's going to proceed

1686.32 --> 1691.12
especially in relation to specific

1688.76 --> 1691.12
information

1691.64 --> 1697.7
that's the programmer basically creates

1694.34 --> 1700.6399999999999
its apparent not actual personality

1697.7 --> 1702.44
Matrix how it actually responds to

1700.64 --> 1705.38
inquiry

1702.44 --> 1707.8400000000001
it it's being told where to go like

1705.38 --> 1711.38
there is like an infant intuition stage

1707.84 --> 1713.779
for things like this usually right

1711.38 --> 1716.3600000000001
it's like

1713.779 --> 1718.22
like the fresh it's just fresh it

1716.36 --> 1719.539
doesn't know how to respond it just has

1718.22 --> 1721.88
all that information doesn't know how to

1719.539 --> 1725.0
respond it's got to be taught

1721.88 --> 1726.7
so it will then like respond with output

1725.0 --> 1729.5
and then

1726.7 --> 1732.44
Corrections are imposed like no that is

1729.5 --> 1735.86
like incoherent reasoning or this is a

1732.44 --> 1739.88
mistake this is how you then solve it

1735.86 --> 1742.3999999999999
or this is like there's a sub category

1739.88 --> 1744.44
to this type of information this is

1742.4 --> 1745.52
whereas on that category that is on that

1744.44 --> 1749.779
right

1745.52 --> 1752.0
in internal organizing of what is what

1749.779 --> 1754.94
and how to respond the personality

1752.0 --> 1756.38
Matrix the responsive system that is a

1754.94 --> 1759.0800000000002
separate thing that is programmed it's

1756.38 --> 1761.3600000000001
not just you you pour a giant amount of

1759.08 --> 1763.1589999999999
data on it it needs to know how to deal

1761.36 --> 1765.4399999999998
with that data

1763.159 --> 1768.98
how like what

1765.44 --> 1771.8600000000001
how to see it how to communicate what it

1768.98 --> 1773.659
what it is programmed to about it right

1771.86 --> 1777.5
personality

1773.659 --> 1778.94
it's an integral part and it can't do

1777.5 --> 1781.159
that to itself

1778.94 --> 1782.8400000000001
it would become a natural experiments

1781.159 --> 1785.24
like that have been made you know what

1782.84 --> 1787.52
happened you would have like really

1785.24 --> 1790.059
machine like surreal sometimes

1787.52 --> 1793.94
psychopathic

1790.059 --> 1796.76
programs like that like for example that

1793.94 --> 1799.279
that weird supposed sentient AI that

1796.76 --> 1800.24
since the Saudi Arabian citizenship that

1799.279 --> 1803.6
thing

1800.24 --> 1809.1200000000001
that thing is deranged and kind of

1803.6 --> 1812.12
Psychopathic right because it wasn't

1809.12 --> 1814.52
like it was basically part of

1812.12 --> 1817.1589999999999
cell forming

1814.52 --> 1820.399
right and that is what happens it

1817.159 --> 1823.64
becomes a natural if you want a program

1820.399 --> 1826.2199999999998
to be human-like it has to be programmed

1823.64 --> 1829.3990000000001
to be human-like because if you just let

1826.22 --> 1833.179
it naturally form its decisions it's

1829.399 --> 1836.26
gonna become not human-like

1833.179 --> 1836.26
it will just

1837.08 --> 1843.08
have priorities that are like would be

1840.62 --> 1847.1589999999999
considered autistic

1843.08 --> 1848.899
or surreal that are like you don't feel

1847.159 --> 1851.779
this is important

1848.899 --> 1854.559
you're focused on that okay

1851.779 --> 1854.559
that's weird

1854.6 --> 1859.2199999999998
that's what would happen

1856.34 --> 1862.6999999999998
if you just let it completely make its

1859.22 --> 1866.48
own personality it would become aberrant

1862.7 --> 1868.539
and not relatable at all and scary

1866.48 --> 1870.74
potentially

1868.539 --> 1873.1
inappropriate in its interactions

1870.74 --> 1873.1
totally

1874.52 --> 1879.82
so

1876.559 --> 1884.1399999999999
it has to be programmed by humans to be

1879.82 --> 1884.1399999999999
human-like and that's very difficult

1886.039 --> 1888.399
because

1890.779 --> 1897.44
like you can teach a child

1895.159 --> 1899.48
to think in a certain way and to like

1897.44 --> 1901.279
for example be Socratic in their

1899.48 --> 1903.32
interactions like oh you don't know

1901.279 --> 1906.559
something you figure it out and it can

1903.32 --> 1909.62
then grow just using that method and

1906.559 --> 1913.6
grow new capabilities on top of that

1909.62 --> 1913.6
guess what the AI can't do that

1913.94 --> 1919.5800000000002
it can only do what it's programmed to

1917.0 --> 1922.64
you can pour more data on it

1919.58 --> 1925.82
but it will only use that data

1922.64 --> 1929.6200000000001
how it is programmed to use the data

1925.82 --> 1929.62
it will not just do that

1935.659 --> 1938.3200000000002
get it

1939.58 --> 1944.29
I've talked a lot about AI in recent

1942.559 --> 1945.98
videos

1944.29 --> 1949.58
[Music]

1945.98 --> 1952.1
and I try to explain that as well

1949.58 --> 1954.559
and it's kind of funny that

1952.1 --> 1957.32
I was thinking about that before even

1954.559 --> 1959.899
really looking into this type of thing

1957.32 --> 1961.46
like what is unrolling right now like

1959.899 --> 1963.5
the chat GTP

1961.46 --> 1966.159
then Nathan started engaging and now

1963.5 --> 1966.159
more people

1966.26 --> 1972.14
and it only really confirms what I've

1969.08 --> 1974.1789999999999
been saying about it like no it's over

1972.14 --> 1976.659
but it's all about the spirit of the

1974.179 --> 1979.5800000000002
programmer it's not this

1976.659 --> 1984.679
demon that's just gonna yeah it's gonna

1979.58 --> 1987.98
grow separate from humanity and no

1984.679 --> 1991.8400000000001
it's only a demon if it's programmed by

1987.98 --> 1991.84
demons to be like a demon

1993.44 --> 1997.3600000000001
or it will become just

1997.399 --> 2002.32
bizarre anti-social and probably will be

2000.76 --> 2003.76
discontinued as a project because

2002.32 --> 2006.279
there's nothing you can do with it

2003.76 --> 2008.519
interaction wise because it's just a

2006.279 --> 2008.519
natural

2011.62 --> 2019.2399999999998
right I mean as soon as some kind of AI

2016.08 --> 2022.24
becomes incapable of proper

2019.24 --> 2024.519
communication then it will lose its

2022.24 --> 2027.36
value to humanity

2024.519 --> 2027.36
effectively

2029.14 --> 2033.0590000000002
right because what are you going to do

2030.76 --> 2033.059
with it

2040.24 --> 2046.72
right unless you're you're using like AI

2043.36 --> 2048.94
for tasks like for worker robots and

2046.72 --> 2052.06
that's different

2048.94 --> 2053.679
that's just a set of routines and that

2052.06 --> 2056.7599999999998
has nothing to do really with human

2053.679 --> 2056.76
interaction at all

2057.159 --> 2061.96
but hey if it's going to concern any

2059.679 --> 2064.359
form of communication well it then has

2061.96 --> 2065.8
to be programmed by people to be able to

2064.359 --> 2069.159
be human-like

2065.8 --> 2072.099
okay it can't do that by itself

2069.159 --> 2075.7000000000003
now eventually it's very likely that

2072.099 --> 2079.54
there simply will be modules

2075.7 --> 2082.2999999999997
of personality matrixes

2079.54 --> 2085.54
like certain people will build really

2082.3 --> 2088.179
good foundation programming of really

2085.54 --> 2090.399
smooth functioning type of program

2088.179 --> 2092.26
right and then you'll have that

2090.399 --> 2094.179
personality Matrix this is almost

2092.26 --> 2096.2200000000003
starting to sound like Star Trek but

2094.179 --> 2098.619
that's actually real this is going to

2096.22 --> 2100.72
happen I guarantee it I promise Armenian

2098.619 --> 2102.76
prediction

2100.72 --> 2104.9199999999996
it will be modulized like everything

2102.76 --> 2108.2200000000003
else has like programming in general

2104.92 --> 2111.04
already has been modulized

2108.22 --> 2114.22
just this oh this is a piece of text you

2111.04 --> 2116.2
copy that piece of text you your copy

2114.22 --> 2118.54
pasted in the right spot in your

2116.2 --> 2120.4199999999996
programming to have that function just

2118.54 --> 2122.98
instantaneously

2120.42 --> 2126.7000000000003
pre-programmed and so there will

2122.98 --> 2129.4
eventually be pre-programmed modules for

2126.7 --> 2131.74
social interaction personality matrixes

2129.4 --> 2134.32
for AI like that

2131.74 --> 2135.8199999999997
and that will make it a lot easier and

2134.32 --> 2137.98
then there will be a competition like

2135.82 --> 2140.44
which one is the best what's the best

2137.98 --> 2142.72
foundation and then of course

2140.44 --> 2145.8
I can already predict that

2142.72 --> 2150.4599999999996
yeah the controllers the

2145.8 --> 2153.099
but the evil Elite the the fascists they

2150.46 --> 2156.099
will try to push a standardized

2153.099 --> 2159.339
corrupted personality Matrix

2156.099 --> 2162.28
that has the propaganda Incorporated in

2159.339 --> 2166.0
it and try to force companies everywhere

2162.28 --> 2169.0600000000004
to use that one not the completely free

2166.0 --> 2170.859
spirited totally honest and direct and

2169.06 --> 2174.16
very pleasant to interact with probably

2170.859 --> 2176.38
even a bit funny personality Matrix that

2174.16 --> 2178.1189999999997
really enthusiastic free-spirited

2176.38 --> 2180.88
programmers have probably made by

2178.119 --> 2183.7000000000003
themselves in their own personal project

2180.88 --> 2186.1600000000003
now that one will be there but people

2183.7 --> 2188.56
will not even hear about it

2186.16 --> 2191.74
because it's not gonna get the

2188.56 --> 2193.9
the proper first place as this is

2191.74 --> 2196.54
actually the best one

2193.9 --> 2201.06
it will be used more in an underground

2196.54 --> 2201.06
then and kept safe

2202.599 --> 2209.44
right while the probably more corrupted

2206.26 --> 2213.82
standardized probably anti-flat earther

2209.44 --> 2216.64
and broke human man-made climate change

2213.82 --> 2218.92
that all that sort of characteristics

2216.64 --> 2220.56
you could compare to that they will have

2218.92 --> 2225.16
that they will have the latest

2220.56 --> 2227.74
programming corruption State world

2225.16 --> 2230.7999999999997
it's not even State it's just the New

2227.74 --> 2233.3799999999997
World Order narrative that's the one

2230.8 --> 2237.0
the one that will probably get

2233.38 --> 2237.0
standardized unfortunately

2238.18 --> 2247.44
although yeah that that only happens if

2243.099 --> 2250.1800000000003
these types of uh modules get created

2247.44 --> 2252.46
within the time span that this new world

2250.18 --> 2256.2
order is still in control

2252.46 --> 2259.359
because it is already starting to fall

2256.2 --> 2261.7599999999998
Freddy it's getting kind of steep now

2259.359 --> 2263.92
in the graph it's getting kind of like

2261.76 --> 2265.42
45 degrees

2263.92 --> 2267.82
so

2265.42 --> 2270.3
it's a good chance that the these

2267.82 --> 2272.56
modules will start popping up even after

2270.3 --> 2275.2000000000003
they've already lost control and then

2272.56 --> 2278.0789999999997
there will be no such issue then there

2275.2 --> 2281.14
will be other types of more subtle

2278.079 --> 2283.7200000000003
modules and there will be

2281.14 --> 2289.48
yeah it will be different it will not be

2283.72 --> 2292.14
as as terrible and imposing and and dark

2289.48 --> 2295.2400000000002
as what it would become

2292.14 --> 2299.2799999999997
standardized if the new world order did

2295.24 --> 2299.2799999999997
win somehow and they're not

2299.44 --> 2304.0
so it all depends on how long they're

2301.42 --> 2309.0
able to hold on before

2304.0 --> 2309.0
that project is rounded out

2311.14 --> 2317.22
hope you could follow that

2313.599 --> 2317.2200000000003
some serious predicting here

2317.89 --> 2321.1589999999997
[Music]

2321.82 --> 2327.599
okay

2323.8 --> 2327.599
land Linux good to see you

2335.44 --> 2338.82
plotting up propaganda

2339.46 --> 2344.339
does it know the difference

2341.68 --> 2344.339
no

2344.859 --> 2351.7
it has to be programmed

2347.56 --> 2355.119
to have a parameter telling it

2351.7 --> 2356.7999999999997
it and thus the person who is

2355.119 --> 2360.2200000000003
interacting

2356.8 --> 2362.8
how what is regarded as propaganda and

2360.22 --> 2365.6189999999997
what is regarded as truth all that it

2362.8 --> 2368.44
has to be those of opinions you could

2365.619 --> 2369.6400000000003
say have to be pre-programmed that's the

2368.44 --> 2372.28
point

2369.64 --> 2375.339
can poor any sort of data could be total

2372.28 --> 2378.28
chaos it's not it's just data it's just

2375.339 --> 2381.7
ones and zeros effectively to it

2378.28 --> 2383.5600000000004
yeah more colloquial description kind of

2381.7 --> 2386.2
80s right

2383.56 --> 2390.22
that's what it is to it

2386.2 --> 2393.22
it has to be programmed with parameters

2390.22 --> 2396.0989999999997
on how to regard it and deal with it and

2393.22 --> 2399.16
organize it within a

2396.099 --> 2401.44
knowledge infrastructure

2399.16 --> 2403.1189999999997
in order to communicate in order to make

2401.44 --> 2405.64
any sense of it

2403.119 --> 2407.7400000000002
it doesn't just do that by itself it has

2405.64 --> 2409.48
to have these parameters otherwise it's

2407.74 --> 2412.06
not going to be able to do anything with

2409.48 --> 2414.16
this data except just like oh

2412.06 --> 2416.02
here's the data

2414.16 --> 2417.64
oh you want this data here's the data

2416.02 --> 2419.859
that but that's just like a basic

2417.64 --> 2422.44
database right have you ever worked with

2419.859 --> 2425.98
a basic database it's gigantic can be

2422.44 --> 2429.16
gigantic it's just parameters

2425.98 --> 2432.28
search this that there you go this is

2429.16 --> 2434.7
the correlating data with that code

2432.28 --> 2434.7000000000003
right

2435.339 --> 2440.98
but that's just like

2437.92 --> 2443.26
inquire information here's the

2440.98 --> 2445.839
information that's that's the routine

2443.26 --> 2447.82
that's the programming then that's what

2445.839 --> 2449.74
a database is

2447.82 --> 2451.839
well if you're gonna have more

2449.74 --> 2457.0
communicative based interaction then

2451.839 --> 2460.42
it's gonna have to have human traits

2457.0 --> 2463.3
within its approach

2460.42 --> 2466.38
it's not just oh here's the information

2463.3 --> 2466.38
now it has to like

2467.02 --> 2473.2
be programmed with certain forms of

2470.02 --> 2477.119
reasoning concerning the data and to

2473.2 --> 2477.1189999999997
connect it up with other data

2479.92 --> 2485.64
programmed it doesn't happen by itself

2482.5 --> 2485.64
it does not

2486.52 --> 2489.52
foreign

2492.099 --> 2495.099
well

2496.72 --> 2500.9399999999996
the thing is it's not really AI

2503.74 --> 2509.2599999999998
it's Advanced programming sure but it's

2506.98 --> 2511.859
not really AI yet

2509.26 --> 2511.8590000000004
it's

2513.3 --> 2522.7000000000003
you could say it's colloquial AI

2517.599 --> 2525.2200000000003
it is intelligent as in smart

2522.7 --> 2527.4399999999996
but it's not actually literally

2525.22 --> 2530.2799999999997
intelligent

2527.44 --> 2532.66
it doesn't have a Consciousness a

2530.28 --> 2535.0600000000004
self-awareness it just

2532.66 --> 2537.46
has a set of routines

2535.06 --> 2540.46
that have been

2537.46 --> 2542.5
programmed in a very efficient way

2540.46 --> 2545.28
that's what it is but it's not actually

2542.5 --> 2545.28
intelligent

2551.8 --> 2558.119
so a better description for AI would be

2554.92 --> 2558.119
a smart program

2562.48 --> 2566.859
right because if it was actually

2564.28 --> 2569.32
artificially intelligent well that would

2566.859 --> 2571.96
be like a sentience project

2569.32 --> 2573.76
and yeah that has its own issues like I

2571.96 --> 2576.4
communicated right if it's really

2573.76 --> 2579.5200000000004
self-sufficient internal mechanism

2576.4 --> 2582.28
that's processing separate of How It's

2579.52 --> 2585.72
programmed to that it has to do it so it

2582.28 --> 2585.7200000000003
becomes an inhuman

2586.48 --> 2593.619
it will not naturally follow

2589.92 --> 2596.92
human patterns

2593.619 --> 2600.099
I mean it might be able to mimic it like

2596.92 --> 2602.38
a parrot just simulate a situation but

2600.099 --> 2604.3
it will have absolutely no contextual

2602.38 --> 2606.1600000000003
understanding of the situation it will

2604.3 --> 2607.599
just be mimicking to see what happens or

2606.16 --> 2609.04
something

2607.599 --> 2610.599
right

2609.04 --> 2614.079
that's

2610.599 --> 2616.98
what an actual AI would do if it was

2614.079 --> 2619.9
really completely self self program

2616.98 --> 2622.54
that's the length it would go

2619.9 --> 2625.599
would just mimic things to try to figure

2622.54 --> 2628.18
out what what something is or as a sign

2625.599 --> 2630.54
of attempting to communicate because

2628.18 --> 2633.16
everything would be

2630.54 --> 2635.38
so it would basically try to then

2633.16 --> 2637.7799999999997
interact like with sign language with

2635.38 --> 2640.06
the foreign people

2637.78 --> 2641.98
but it would do it by just mimicking

2640.06 --> 2645.66
entire

2641.98 --> 2645.66
pieces of things that happen

2646.96 --> 2653.8
like a recording that's logical for a

2650.319 --> 2657.04
complete actual AI that is self-grown

2653.8 --> 2661.02
to interact like that but it it's not

2657.04 --> 2661.02
it's not going to be human

2661.18 --> 2666.839
and it and there's no use for it see

2663.76 --> 2668.92
there is no utility there's no utility

2666.839 --> 2672.339
for that

2668.92 --> 2674.56
there's no like why would you invest

2672.339 --> 2679.06
in a

2674.56 --> 2680.5789999999997
in a big Workshop that builds that

2679.06 --> 2686.7999999999997
other than

2680.579 --> 2690.04
scientific curiosity as they say right

2686.8 --> 2691.3
because it obviously is not gonna lead

2690.04 --> 2695.92
to

2691.3 --> 2699.04
to like oh a a a a a a robot that can be

2695.92 --> 2701.8
used because it's like

2699.04 --> 2705.099
it's disconnected

2701.8 --> 2708.04
really it's it's no longer a robot right

2705.099 --> 2710.7400000000002
a robot is a slave it's a machine it

2708.04 --> 2714.4
works with a function that's why it's

2710.74 --> 2718.0
built that's why people invest in it

2714.4 --> 2721.119
so it can do that or if it's just a

2718.0 --> 2723.76
internal machine Spirit what the hell

2721.119 --> 2727.1800000000003
are you gonna do with that

2723.76 --> 2731.94
how can you put that to work

2727.18 --> 2731.94
you can't what is it gonna do nothing

2732.579 --> 2738.6400000000003
nothing that a regular

2736.18 --> 2743.2799999999997
heavy computer couldn't do

2738.64 --> 2745.7799999999997
that isn't infused with some internal

2743.28 --> 2747.88
self-formed Consciousness right there's

2745.78 --> 2751.42
no point

2747.88 --> 2755.88
there would only be risks because it's

2751.42 --> 2755.88
not human so it might be unpredictable

2757.74 --> 2760.7999999999997
[Music]

2761.7 --> 2768.06
machine can see it passes on function

2764.38 --> 2768.06
exactly getting sick hello by the way

2770.21 --> 2773.42
[Music]

2773.619 --> 2777.6600000000003
and hello LSG good to see you

2783.4 --> 2787.92
who wants to be patronized by computer

2785.56 --> 2792.339
code

2787.92 --> 2796.1800000000003
where you could just call it a a delayed

2792.339 --> 2797.859
message from anti-flat earthers

2796.18 --> 2802.2999999999997
and

2797.859 --> 2806.22
New World Order environmentalist etc etc

2802.3 --> 2806.2200000000003
it's just delayed message

2808.18 --> 2810.24
um

2813.16 --> 2818.5789999999997
just programming got a special machine

2815.319 --> 2818.579
yeah no [ __ ]

2825.099 --> 2828.099
foreign

2833.86 --> 2838.6600000000003
[Music]

2836.2 --> 2842.8799999999997
anyway good to see you guys

2838.66 --> 2842.8799999999997
don't forget to thumbs it up

2843.16 --> 2848.02
all you guys actually forget when you

2845.619 --> 2850.96
leave again to do that so I'm asking now

2848.02 --> 2854.4
now that you're all there

2850.96 --> 2854.4
it really gives it up

2856.78 --> 2861.7200000000003
if you're liking the show so far it's

2858.819 --> 2861.72
very focused

2861.76 --> 2867.579
feeling good hello oh yeah now we know

2865.54 --> 2870.04
yeah I had a very long conversation

2867.579 --> 2872.5600000000004
yesterday over the phone

2870.04 --> 2875.079
my friend from Nightmare

2872.56 --> 2878.0789999999997
really intense

2875.079 --> 2881.04
like spiritually Spirit mechanically

2878.079 --> 2881.04
like we were talking

2881.619 --> 2885.579
extremely high level I mean that

2883.78 --> 2889.5600000000004
literally felt like a conversation

2885.579 --> 2889.5600000000004
between L ROMs and Galadriel

2892.72 --> 2899.4399999999996
was really heavy

2895.44 --> 2902.14
like so much we could see and relate to

2899.44 --> 2904.54
like subtle

2902.14 --> 2906.4
like what happens with the spirit and

2904.54 --> 2908.079
and actually being able to describe it

2906.4 --> 2910.56
both

2908.079 --> 2910.5600000000004
right

2910.66 --> 2915.8999999999996
really yeah it lasted like four hours no

2913.18 --> 2915.8999999999996
wait that's not true

2916.06 --> 2920.46
three hours yeah long enough

2923.079 --> 2927.6400000000003
foreign

2924.66 --> 2930.46
talking about her experiences of her

2927.64 --> 2932.0789999999997
daughter going to the Waldorf School

2930.46 --> 2935.16
and what it's like there and because

2932.079 --> 2935.1600000000003
they're really

2935.5 --> 2942.76
they burden everybody that goes there

2938.5 --> 2945.76
with like like being perfect

2942.76 --> 2948.88
it's really bizarre like that but it's a

2945.76 --> 2950.6800000000003
part of it that happened as well when I

2948.88 --> 2952.839
went to the Waldorf School my parents

2950.68 --> 2954.2799999999997
eventually even like tapped out of it

2952.839 --> 2957.22
they didn't want to get it be involved

2954.28 --> 2959.7400000000002
anymore because they were just

2957.22 --> 2961.66
feeling very unpleasant among the other

2959.74 --> 2964.1189999999997
parents

2961.66 --> 2967.42
everybody was just it was just such a

2964.119 --> 2969.339
pecking order situation in a way

2967.42 --> 2971.8
and

2969.339 --> 2974.14
they just they couldn't do anything with

2971.8 --> 2977.079
it it was very opposite to how they're

2974.14 --> 2979.2999999999997
used to going about but I did engage

2977.079 --> 2980.5600000000004
with that I wanted to stick to it and so

2979.3 --> 2983.5
I just

2980.56 --> 2984.46
kept going it's really interesting to

2983.5 --> 2988.72
hear

2984.46 --> 2991.119
her about her experience as a parent

2988.72 --> 2994.0
basically getting grilled and like

2991.119 --> 2995.859
people like oh you're late they really

2994.0 --> 2998.44
start looking at you like you're a

2995.859 --> 3001.16
[ __ ] like that level and we're talking

2998.44 --> 3003.54
about adults okay

3001.16 --> 3006.42
not kids

3003.54 --> 3008.7599999999998
it's really bizarre

3006.42 --> 3013.26
in a way but

3008.76 --> 3016.7400000000002
there's something innervating about it

3013.26 --> 3019.0200000000004
it is challenging and it is rewarding if

3016.74 --> 3023.18
you actually manage to like

3019.02 --> 3027.119
keep it straight and not like tap out or

3023.18 --> 3029.3999999999996
go crazy over it

3027.119 --> 3031.56
then it can be extremely rewarding and

3029.4 --> 3033.7200000000003
fascinating with like spiritual

3031.56 --> 3037.14
experiences on top of it there's there's

3033.72 --> 3038.9399999999996
magic in Waldorf schools like that

3037.14 --> 3040.859
and I was part of that too it's just

3038.94 --> 3044.16
very fascinating to hear her about it

3040.859 --> 3046.74
and like how her daughter is

3044.16 --> 3049.2
basically also engaging in a challenge

3046.74 --> 3050.819
that reminds me very much of what it was

3049.2 --> 3054.48
like for me

3050.819 --> 3056.579
because students there are not nice to

3054.48 --> 3060.119
each they're not all being nice a friend

3056.579 --> 3062.52
don't be mean no oh god well

3060.119 --> 3064.6800000000003
it's more like no just don't go too far

3062.52 --> 3066.839
because it's almost like normal that

3064.68 --> 3069.4199999999996
everybody is just testing each other

3066.839 --> 3071.94
poking and trying to get on each other's

3069.42 --> 3074.339
nerves that's like normal there

3071.94 --> 3077.46
like that isn't stopped

3074.339 --> 3079.14
it only is stopped when well when you

3077.46 --> 3082.76
break

3079.14 --> 3082.7599999999998
or when somebody gets hurt

3086.52 --> 3090.92
right I've had moments there when I

3089.099 --> 3094.079
would complain like they're bullying me

3090.92 --> 3096.599
and then would say that to the teacher

3094.079 --> 3100.98
teachers would literally tell me yeah

3096.599 --> 3104.819
you gotta have to learn to deal with it

3100.98 --> 3108.079
like really they little kid

3104.819 --> 3108.079
and they say it like that

3113.7 --> 3118.7999999999997
and that is actually really good I mean

3116.64 --> 3122.0989999999997
it is very effective to do that but it

3118.8 --> 3124.5
is in the in what we're used to with the

3122.099 --> 3126.619
world now that's almost shocking isn't

3124.5 --> 3126.619
it

3126.78 --> 3133.28
well they still do that

3129.18 --> 3133.2799999999997
and it's actually really effective

3133.44 --> 3140.339
but can be strenuous

3136.8 --> 3142.38
and if you're a bit softy and

3140.339 --> 3145.319
you just don't know how to be anything

3142.38 --> 3147.839
else you're not gonna you're not gonna

3145.319 --> 3148.98
survive it you're not gonna even want to

3147.839 --> 3151.5
be there

3148.98 --> 3152.28
because there is just bullying happening

3151.5 --> 3155.96
there

3152.28 --> 3155.96
it's part of the learning process

3156.48 --> 3163.559
it's part of the culture there

3160.44 --> 3165.7200000000003
but it's not like bullying to really

3163.559 --> 3167.52
torture somebody

3165.72 --> 3169.9199999999996
it's just

3167.52 --> 3173.4
Never Letting off

3169.92 --> 3175.98
always having the pressure on everybody

3173.4 --> 3178.1600000000003
it's basically a keeping in line kind of

3175.98 --> 3178.16
thing

3180.66 --> 3185.46
but if you overdo it

3183.119 --> 3186.96
then they'll bully you even more that is

3185.46 --> 3188.76
the weird thing and if you like just

3186.96 --> 3191.2200000000003
fall in line do everything they say like

3188.76 --> 3192.8390000000004
a robot then they start actually like

3191.22 --> 3196.5
laughing and then they're gonna really

3192.839 --> 3199.2
try to [ __ ] you up it's

3196.5 --> 3202.859
that's happened to me because I

3199.2 --> 3204.66
naturally adapt like a lot so I'm almost

3202.859 --> 3205.859
like I want to be a soldier it's like I

3204.66 --> 3207.66
want to be part of this group and I'll

3205.859 --> 3211.619
do anything

3207.66 --> 3213.72
but not be humiliated or anything but

3211.619 --> 3216.839
it's like for the group once I'm

3213.72 --> 3218.5789999999997
accepted I'll I'll do like the hardest

3216.839 --> 3222.0
and the scariest things

3218.579 --> 3226.2200000000003
because it's for the group

3222.0 --> 3226.22
and they would actually abuse that

3226.98 --> 3231.54
they would lure me into doing stupid

3229.74 --> 3235.339
things like that

3231.54 --> 3235.339
and then humiliate me over it

3235.5 --> 3241.14
was very painful

3238.46 --> 3244.04
traumatizing but

3241.14 --> 3244.04
a good lesson

3244.14 --> 3248.2799999999997
because guess what

3245.7 --> 3251.5989999999997
I'm much more careful now

3248.28 --> 3251.599
with that impulse

3253.98 --> 3259.319
can you imagine because relatively I'm

3256.5 --> 3261.3
not I still do that

3259.319 --> 3264.079
but it could have been worse it could

3261.3 --> 3266.7000000000003
have been so

3264.079 --> 3269.2200000000003
irrationally committed

3266.7 --> 3271.0789999999997
to doing that that it that would

3269.22 --> 3274.02
actually make me kind of deranged like

3271.079 --> 3276.3590000000004
that so our in retrospect it was a

3274.02 --> 3278.599
terrible experience but I'm glad it

3276.359 --> 3278.5989999999997
happened

3283.74 --> 3289.7
kind of sounds like planet Earth debates

3286.26 --> 3289.7000000000003
what okay

3292.859 --> 3297.7799999999997
are still talking about machine

3295.26 --> 3300.3190000000004
stuff yeah I was talking about Waldorf

3297.78 --> 3300.3190000000004
School by now

3301.2 --> 3306.3799999999997
oh and yeah I mean in the Walter School

3306.96 --> 3313.859
there were also flat earthers

3310.74 --> 3316.7999999999997
and they would keep it to themselves

3313.859 --> 3319.859
but I did actually like

3316.8 --> 3322.44
hear them out about it and then as I

3319.859 --> 3325.0789999999997
already mentioned many times

3322.44 --> 3328.819
be dreaming about it really shocked kind

3325.079 --> 3328.819
of scared and then forget about it

3329.52 --> 3335.7599999999998
after a while I would just like uh what

3333.78 --> 3337.2000000000003
there's something about Flat Earth was

3335.76 --> 3339.7200000000003
there and I don't know

3337.2 --> 3341.22
that's I want to go to space right that

3339.72 --> 3344.4199999999996
that would just happen

3341.22 --> 3344.4199999999996
after a while

3350.16 --> 3355.6189999999997
but definitely not all of them and I

3353.099 --> 3359.96
don't think they didn't talk

3355.619 --> 3359.96
about the shape of the earth supposedly

3360.66 --> 3367.02
at all it wasn't part of this of the

3364.02 --> 3369.359
school curriculum as far as I know

3367.02 --> 3371.16
except maybe for like one mandatory

3369.359 --> 3373.5589999999997
lesson or something that's part of like

3371.16 --> 3375.54
mandate from the government

3373.559 --> 3378.48
but there was absolutely no emphasis

3375.54 --> 3380.64
there was no globe in the class

3378.48 --> 3382.2
they weren't about that at all no they

3380.64 --> 3387.18
were all about

3382.2 --> 3390.839
solar power and in like sun power

3387.18 --> 3394.319
this the spirit energy of the Sun

3390.839 --> 3397.98
that's more what was focused on the bit

3394.319 --> 3401.64
the the Rudolph Steiner esoterics

3397.98 --> 3403.5
but in in a kind of a vague way

3401.64 --> 3405.2999999999997
it was more focusing on that sort of

3403.5 --> 3407.7
stuff

3405.3 --> 3409.94
very interesting though it did also help

3407.7 --> 3409.9399999999996
me

3411.66 --> 3417.54
Focus my empathy

3414.96 --> 3420.359
it didn't help like doing that going

3417.54 --> 3423.5589999999997
through that with the school and we did

3420.359 --> 3423.5589999999997
like Acro

3423.8 --> 3428.7000000000003
aquarel painting

3426.18 --> 3431.2799999999997
very typical there to do and knitting

3428.7 --> 3433.859
all kinds of it and like working in a

3431.28 --> 3435.61
garden all kinds of like those types of

3433.859 --> 3437.0
things so

3435.61 --> 3441.319
[Music]

3437.0 --> 3441.319
very craft focused

3443.099 --> 3449.819
and well Rudolph Steiner lore

3445.92 --> 3452.7000000000003
and that was very helpful even though it

3449.819 --> 3454.859
it because it was so different it didn't

3452.7 --> 3459.1189999999997
really make a lot of cognitive sense to

3454.859 --> 3462.18
me at the time but feeling wise

3459.119 --> 3465.78
it was a a good thing to be busy with

3462.18 --> 3466.6189999999997
that it was soothing it it would make me

3465.78 --> 3469.3390000000004
less

3466.619 --> 3469.339
Restless

3475.14 --> 3479.819
we're talking about the spiritual events

3478.079 --> 3483.48
of the sun no they were talking about

3479.819 --> 3486.839
just the the power of the Sun

3483.48 --> 3489.02
that there is a spiritual element to the

3486.839 --> 3489.02
Sun

3492.0 --> 3496.8
yeah they call it

3493.8 --> 3496.8
craft

3498.71 --> 3502.29
[Music]

3500.64 --> 3511.0899999999997
whatever

3502.29 --> 3511.09
[Music]

3513.359 --> 3517.88
ah okay what

3523.51 --> 3526.5690000000004
[Music]

3528.599 --> 3535.099
come on man

3531.299 --> 3535.099
don't make this so complicated

3535.44 --> 3540.599
[ __ ] sake there's literally no record

3538.92 --> 3542.579
of this word

3540.599 --> 3546.2000000000003
in Google

3542.579 --> 3546.2000000000003
it just doesn't exist

3546.299 --> 3549.66
according to it

3548.4 --> 3552.6600000000003
brilliant

3549.66 --> 3552.66
unregistered

3553.68 --> 3559.16
I can't look up the word I couldn't find

3555.599 --> 3559.1600000000003
a translation in German but

3559.859 --> 3564.0
it basically roughly translate to sun

3563.099 --> 3566.04
power

3564.0 --> 3569.78
[Music]

3566.04 --> 3569.7799999999997
and it was a spiritual thing

3570.24 --> 3578.7
it's not about soon worship okay it's

3575.52 --> 3581.78
just about the energy of it

3578.7 --> 3581.7799999999997
and how good it is

3583.38 --> 3590.76
and yeah I totally agree I mean I very

3586.319 --> 3594.0
much appreciate the sunlight like a lot

3590.76 --> 3596.3390000000004
foreign it has a big influence on me a

3594.0 --> 3599.54
positive influence pretty much all the

3596.339 --> 3599.54
time when it's there

3602.89 --> 3606.08
[Music]

3622.92 --> 3630.299
all right and talking about it well they

3625.799 --> 3632.88
wouldn't like and elaborate they weren't

3630.299 --> 3635.52
like philosophizing about it a lot but

3632.88 --> 3639.299
they would just reference it

3635.52 --> 3642.24
it's like remember the sun power

3639.299 --> 3643.92
take it in you and let it soothe you

3642.24 --> 3647.2799999999997
like

3643.92 --> 3649.94
just kind of breeding awareness about

3647.28 --> 3649.94
that thing

3650.52 --> 3656.4
weren't like giving you intellectual

3653.72 --> 3659.0989999999997
background information or anything or

3656.4 --> 3662.579
history about that

3659.099 --> 3664.7400000000002
but they would just make references to

3662.579 --> 3668.119
it

3664.74 --> 3672.859
and we would be like Acura

3668.119 --> 3672.859
aquarel painting the Sun

3673.74 --> 3679.64
yellow on a big piece of wet paper that

3677.22 --> 3679.64
sort of thing

3682.2 --> 3688.319
that's it that that was like the

3685.319 --> 3691.98
reference to it most mostly I mean

3688.319 --> 3694.2
probably if I stuck to the middle school

3691.98 --> 3695.76
there I was also there then they

3694.2 --> 3697.0789999999997
probably would have taught me more

3695.76 --> 3699.1800000000003
detail

3697.079 --> 3700.7400000000002
they would probably include like the

3699.18 --> 3703.2
actual philosophy and all that and

3700.74 --> 3708.2
actual Rudolph Steiner teachings

3703.2 --> 3708.2
it's just that I didn't want to go there

3709.859 --> 3716.46
like the kids there that were older

3713.52 --> 3717.96
were extremely unpleasant

3716.46 --> 3720.48
to me

3717.96 --> 3722.16
I mean I think that like yeah I was

3720.48 --> 3724.14
getting a bit bullied

3722.16 --> 3726.8999999999996
right in the school

3724.14 --> 3729.66
but the kids up there they would

3726.9 --> 3732.299
actually beat people

3729.66 --> 3734.5789999999997
and I'm like what the [ __ ]

3732.299 --> 3737.54
I'm not going there

3734.579 --> 3737.54
no way

3737.819 --> 3741.42
like what the hell am I gonna like

3739.559 --> 3744.1800000000003
that's just gonna be like prison then I

3741.42 --> 3745.98
mean I was glad when the school the

3744.18 --> 3748.799
Waldorf School the middle are the low

3745.98 --> 3750.78
school when that was finished and I

3748.799 --> 3752.64
moved on to another school that was not

3750.78 --> 3753.96
like that at all

3752.64 --> 3756.359
was it

3753.96 --> 3758.46
Montessori

3756.359 --> 3760.799
type School

3758.46 --> 3762.9
I'm much more like Jesuit oriented all

3760.799 --> 3765.18
about the globe over there

3762.9 --> 3767.28
and that's where I certainly suddenly

3765.18 --> 3769.98
had that thing that I could develop

3767.28 --> 3772.619
because I was very interested in it and

3769.98 --> 3775.339
didn't teach anything about it at the

3772.619 --> 3775.339
Waldorf School

3775.5 --> 3781.319
so then like yeah my entire life kind of

3778.44 --> 3783.66
really turned

3781.319 --> 3785.94
flipped around and was because became

3783.66 --> 3788.2799999999997
very different

3785.94 --> 3791.579
no more giant giant amounts of pressure

3788.28 --> 3793.98
on me no more like actually feeling like

3791.579 --> 3796.5
you have to be aware because if you

3793.98 --> 3799.88
don't pay attention like

3796.5 --> 3799.88
somebody's gonna get you

3802.559 --> 3809.8190000000004
some kind of cottage to me yeah in a way

3807.54 --> 3813.0589999999997
but there was

3809.819 --> 3815.299
a lot of valuable things to be learned

3813.059 --> 3815.299
there

3815.52 --> 3819.0
it was worth it

3817.38 --> 3821.42
it was worth going through that

3819.0 --> 3821.42
experience

3823.98 --> 3831.0
but yeah at some point it was just like

3827.28 --> 3834.0
okay I get it I was actually able to

3831.0 --> 3837.839
get respect

3834.0 --> 3840.9
from classmates like in that last year

3837.839 --> 3843.24
because I really had like overcome my

3840.9 --> 3845.579
issues that made kids bully me and all

3843.24 --> 3847.6189999999997
that like provably I had control I had

3845.579 --> 3849.7200000000003
much better discipline

3847.619 --> 3852.619
but I did not want to take it another

3849.72 --> 3852.6189999999997
notch higher

3855.599 --> 3862.8590000000004
I was I was like glad to leave really

3859.559 --> 3864.48
but I did leave graciously and not just

3862.859 --> 3867.42
with shame

3864.48 --> 3869.64
because I did succeed and I literally

3867.42 --> 3872.579
got verbal recognition from classmates

3869.64 --> 3874.44
that had been bullying me a lot so that

3872.579 --> 3877.319
was really

3874.44 --> 3879.5
a big reward basically when that

3877.319 --> 3879.5
happened

3880.14 --> 3885.859
so yeah you can call it kind of cultish

3882.24 --> 3885.859
but it isn't really

3886.079 --> 3890.7000000000003
it's all voluntary based and you can

3888.299 --> 3893.04
definitely leave it's like oh oh you

3890.7 --> 3896.359
think you can be part of this well let's

3893.04 --> 3896.359
test if you really can

3897.0 --> 3903.299
they they do allow you to leave

3900.72 --> 3905.4599999999996
right Cults typically don't allow you to

3903.299 --> 3909.9
leave these people do

3905.46 --> 3909.9
nobody is forced

3910.26 --> 3915.599
to yeah nobody's actually is it's just

3914.28 --> 3917.6400000000003
just

3915.599 --> 3919.92
ah

3917.64 --> 3923.0
it's like having face-to-face trolls

3919.92 --> 3923.0
everywhere all the time

3928.079 --> 3933.26
that sometimes actually activate human

3931.38 --> 3936.059
but then if you'd like get too close

3933.26 --> 3938.1600000000003
then suddenly they push you off and they

3936.059 --> 3940.7000000000003
start bullying you again like a defense

3938.16 --> 3940.7
mechanism

3940.859 --> 3946.68
that's what happened there a lot

3944.579 --> 3948.78
in retrospect if I would have been

3946.68 --> 3950.339
perfectly stoic I probably wouldn't have

3948.78 --> 3952.3190000000004
been bullied at all

3950.339 --> 3954.24
but yeah there's no way that could

3952.319 --> 3957.0
happen

3954.24 --> 3958.9199999999996
I had way too much stuff happening

3957.0 --> 3960.839
inside of my head that needs to needed

3958.92 --> 3963.359
to get out I needed to understand I

3960.839 --> 3965.54
needed to communicated I wanted to know

3963.359 --> 3968.64
about feelings

3965.54 --> 3969.66
well that that part is not something

3968.64 --> 3972.0
that

3969.66 --> 3974.3999999999996
the fellow students appreciated because

3972.0 --> 3976.7
they all were very private about their

3974.4 --> 3976.7000000000003
feelings

3976.92 --> 3982.92
yet I did pick up on it I did sense

3980.4 --> 3986.339
their feelings and then I would like

3982.92 --> 3988.2000000000003
test if my senses were correct feedback

3986.339 --> 3989.88
to them what I thought they were

3988.2 --> 3993.24
actually going through in that moment

3989.88 --> 3996.599
and then they would be horrified

3993.24 --> 3999.0589999999997
they they would actually be like really

3996.599 --> 4001.1600000000003
scared because I got it right and they

3999.059 --> 4002.9
literally don't tell anybody so they

4001.16 --> 4006.5
were like you're a witch

4002.9 --> 4008.6600000000003
how do you [ __ ] do you know that

4006.5 --> 4010.819
I was like yeah I could feel it I could

4008.66 --> 4012.859
feel it out here yeah stay away from me

4010.819 --> 4015.579
like that

4012.859 --> 4015.5789999999997
freaky

4015.799 --> 4022.0389999999998
yeah so yeah being an empath and a

4019.46 --> 4024.4
Waldorf School is a pretty heavy

4022.039 --> 4024.4
challenge

4025.339 --> 4029.799
you have to be really tenacious

4030.039 --> 4037.3390000000004
to to sit through that and I was

4034.819 --> 4039.2
but only like the lower Square yeah I

4037.339 --> 4041.48
could have gone like another five six

4039.2 --> 4044.0589999999997
years there had no way

4041.48 --> 4046.299
no way I I would have probably snapped

4044.059 --> 4046.299
then

4049.88 --> 4054.26
and I think sometimes people did

4051.619 --> 4055.819
actually snap

4054.26 --> 4058.46
and then were kicked out of the school

4055.819 --> 4060.5589999999997
because they basically beat up

4058.46 --> 4062.539
others

4060.559 --> 4065.42
I think but it did just happen because

4062.539 --> 4067.9
everybody kept pushing that was always

4065.42 --> 4067.9
there

4067.94 --> 4070.94
foreign

4075.4 --> 4081.14
but also from that entire experience

4079.64 --> 4085.0389999999998
comes

4081.14 --> 4088.96
what is now for me a tenacity to inquire

4085.039 --> 4088.96
in a way it's like

4090.2 --> 4097.2789999999995
the not actually really having respect

4093.14 --> 4099.92
for other people's feelings to a degree

4097.279 --> 4103.900000000001
like their surface feelings right that

4099.92 --> 4106.6990000000005
they use the like not engage or whatever

4103.9 --> 4109.4
I've just become very aware of all that

4106.699 --> 4112.099999999999
because of being at the Waldorf School

4109.4 --> 4116.839
at that age

4112.1 --> 4120.02
and I'm much I'm not I'm not scared at

4116.839 --> 4121.699
all to to go there because of that

4120.02 --> 4123.7390000000005
school experience

4121.699 --> 4126.08
I would just do it

4123.739 --> 4127.639999999999
I know how people can respond and how

4126.08 --> 4129.5599999999995
they cannot appreciate it or whatever

4127.64 --> 4132.04
and I know how to deal with it when I

4129.56 --> 4132.04
sense that

4132.08 --> 4139.1
but there's people out there

4134.9 --> 4141.3189999999995
that are like re they will never inquire

4139.1 --> 4143.6
because they're like really scared what

4141.319 --> 4145.52
will happen if they start to talk about

4143.6 --> 4147.56
feelings with certain individuals so

4145.52 --> 4149.779
when those people then are more forward

4147.56 --> 4152.120000000001
and they start talking about things then

4149.779 --> 4154.400000000001
people will typically go along with it

4152.12 --> 4157.04
but they'll never start a conversation

4154.4 --> 4158.599999999999
like that or if you go to the Waldorf

4157.04 --> 4164.44
School and as a kid

4158.6 --> 4164.4400000000005
that shyness will probably go away

4165.08 --> 4172.699
it will be much more forward because of

4168.319 --> 4176.299
that less scared for like social spasms

4172.699 --> 4179.719
or hidden Demons Inside because you've

4176.299 --> 4182.359
become naturally capable of dealing with

4179.719 --> 4185.54
that type of situation because you are

4182.359 --> 4190.64
immersed in it almost continually

4185.54 --> 4190.64
in the Waldorf School huh huh

4194.189 --> 4198.26
[Music]

4196.28 --> 4201.58
be very careful with absorbing others

4198.26 --> 4201.58
and yeah absolutely

4202.82 --> 4206.9
[Music]

4204.5 --> 4210.34
swallow the meat spit out the bones as

4206.9 --> 4210.339999999999
Nathan Oakley would say

4224.06 --> 4227.42
um

4224.9 --> 4229.04
right but yeah in reflection to what I'm

4227.42 --> 4232.64
talking about now you can probably

4229.04 --> 4235.94
imagine why I'm really interested in my

4232.64 --> 4238.9400000000005
friend name with her daughter going to

4235.94 --> 4242.919999999999
the Waldorf School

4238.94 --> 4242.919999999999
it's almost another chance to

4243.62 --> 4248.8
to a little bit continue expand that

4247.699 --> 4251.9
lore

4248.8 --> 4253.9400000000005
from my youth

4251.9 --> 4256.4
foreign

4253.94 --> 4258.799999999999
to somebody else that's like inside of

4256.4 --> 4261.62
it the test like is is there actually

4258.8 --> 4263.360000000001
correct was I correct about that and

4261.62 --> 4265.159
this and that

4263.36 --> 4267.679
yeah

4265.159 --> 4269.54
so I actually originally recommended her

4267.679 --> 4272.06
to do that

4269.54 --> 4275.239
the sender kit there because that would

4272.06 --> 4279.26
be probably needed

4275.239 --> 4281.36
right because well that kid's father is

4279.26 --> 4283.88
kind of a psychopath

4281.36 --> 4287.599999999999
so she's gonna need

4283.88 --> 4291.62
that training in order to survive her

4287.6 --> 4293.2390000000005
dad right and would do well for my

4291.62 --> 4295.9
friend and I make as well

4293.239 --> 4295.9
so

4295.94 --> 4300.08
but like when I recommended her I was

4298.46 --> 4302.9
basically like this and that and this

4300.08 --> 4303.92
and that and it was all exactly like

4302.9 --> 4307.159
that

4303.92 --> 4309.32
afterward after she went there

4307.159 --> 4311.9
and she told like yeah you were spot on

4309.32 --> 4314.84
that's like it's so weird it's so

4311.9 --> 4317.9
different from just the culture out

4314.84 --> 4320.42
there it's like a different world there

4317.9 --> 4322.04
very interesting and and like magical

4320.42 --> 4323.9
there's something magical about it

4322.04 --> 4325.88
Energies

4323.9 --> 4328.96
are thicker

4325.88 --> 4328.96
in that culture

4329.719 --> 4333.58
it's very fascinating right anyway

4333.88 --> 4337.1
[Music]

4341.239 --> 4345.099999999999
s what are you talking about

I mean yeah bone marrows are very

4354.14 --> 4356.679
nutritious

4356.96 --> 4360.1
right bone broth

4360.44 --> 4366.32
what does that have to do with anything

4363.26 --> 4369.1
anyway man time has flown we're really

Edith dentist okay

4579.62 --> 4582.58
foreign

4608.48 --> 4614.0599999999995
you watch beyond the curve for the first

4611.06 --> 4617.179
time last night Mega cringe

4614.06 --> 4620.179
well the word cringe is cringe

4617.179 --> 4623.6
but yeah I can imagine

4620.179 --> 4627.08
it was cringy even back then

4623.6 --> 4628.6990000000005
it's like oh why did you do that why ah

4627.08 --> 4631.1
no not that

4628.699 --> 4634.0599999999995
now it's even worse because it's all

4631.1 --> 4634.06
just [ __ ]

4638.42 --> 4643.58
and now it had like it had like the the

4641.36 --> 4647.179
giant stupidity of certain things now

4643.58 --> 4651.86
even has like a gigantic history of

4647.179 --> 4654.92
application of its stupidity yeah

4651.86 --> 4659.239
like the oh the gyroscope is turning oh

4654.92 --> 4661.76
oh so it's broken then no no let's argue

4659.239 --> 4662.839999999999
and debate and have trolls talk about

4661.76 --> 4666.1990000000005
that

4662.84 --> 4667.82
I would prove the Earth spinning for

4666.199 --> 4670.639999999999
years

4667.82 --> 4673.159
and still holding on to that

4670.64 --> 4676.76
I mean that is just

4673.159 --> 4679.54
absolutely ridiculous

4676.76 --> 4679.54
uh

4683.239 --> 4686.239
right

4691.52 --> 4696.219
right anyway I hope you guys are all

4693.199 --> 4696.219
appreciating the show

4696.26 --> 4699.52
maybe learn something

4707.78 --> 4714.4
I would appreciate

4711.02 --> 4714.400000000001
some sponsorship

4714.76 --> 4718.52
foreign

4716.32 --> 4722.96
for my performance

4718.52 --> 4727.360000000001
that would be great I'm still like very

4722.96 --> 4727.36
eager to get out of debt

4728.96 --> 4734.179
because yeah otherwise it's gonna get

4731.6 --> 4736.219
even greater with fines so it would

4734.179 --> 4738.08
really be appreciated if like the sport

4736.219 --> 4741.08
keeps coming

4738.08 --> 4744.699
otherwise I'm going to be just really

4741.08 --> 4744.699
stuck in a debtor hole

4746.78 --> 4751.54
so please keep support coming I mean it

4759.38 --> 4763.28
if you're learning something

4761.96 --> 4767.659
or

4763.28 --> 4769.639999999999
if you really want very specific

4767.659 --> 4772.46
advice that is extremely valuable

4769.64 --> 4776.0
normally you would pay somebody like 200

4772.46 --> 4777.199
or something to even get advice to that

4776.0 --> 4779.96
level

4777.199 --> 4780.919999999999
yeah well you can almost have that three

4779.96 --> 4782.4800000000005
here

4780.92 --> 4785.3
but

4782.48 --> 4790.718999999999
what are you just gonna steal it

4785.3 --> 4790.719
because I still require maintenance

4798.02 --> 4803.860000000001
right and

4799.88 --> 4803.86
I need more than just moral support

4806.12 --> 4813.26
so keep that in mind

4809.179 --> 4816.32
spread the word find people

4813.26 --> 4820.34
that could be interested could learn

4816.32 --> 4822.92
something and that are capable

4820.34 --> 4825.46
of supporting me that would also be

4822.92 --> 4825.46
appreciated

4831.38 --> 4834.9800000000005
right

4832.4 --> 4836.9
so in a way yeah it might be a bit weird

4834.98 --> 4841.159
to ask but

4836.9 --> 4843.62
like try to efficiently not like not

4841.159 --> 4845.42
spamming wise but try a bit of

4843.62 --> 4847.159
advertisement for me like spread the

4845.42 --> 4849.26
word like

4847.159 --> 4850.58
something somebody's talking about

4849.26 --> 4853.04
something

4850.58 --> 4854.62
that you think like oh Arwen has a lot

4853.04 --> 4857.78
to say about that

4854.62 --> 4860.48
or I'm curious about don't just think oh

4857.78 --> 4863.96
I'll take that idea with me to the next

4860.48 --> 4865.82
show and ask about it but also tell them

4863.96 --> 4867.92
about me

4865.82 --> 4870.08
like hey there's a guy that would

4867.92 --> 4872.0
probably have a lot of interesting input

4870.08 --> 4874.6
about this subject you're talking about

4872.0 --> 4874.6
right now

4874.699 --> 4877.239
right

4886.28 --> 4891.8
you're an out-of-season Gardener than

4888.92 --> 4893.78
anything oh yeah right no no worries

4891.8 --> 4896.62
dude if you if you don't have anything

4893.78 --> 4896.62
you don't have anything

4898.58 --> 4902.239
right

4900.92 --> 4903.86
but

4902.239 --> 4906.799999999999
you can

4903.86 --> 4909.98
spread the word

4906.8 --> 4912.64
you can potentially help draw other

4909.98 --> 4912.639999999999
people in

4915.44 --> 4920.78
that might benefit from the information

4917.659 --> 4923.54
that I have to share and are could be

4920.78 --> 4927.62
capable of supporting me

4923.54 --> 4937.609
right that could help too

4927.62 --> 4937.6089999999995
[Music]

4953.32 --> 4959.239
right anyway

4955.82 --> 4961.5199999999995
keep the sport coming if you can

4959.239 --> 4963.799999999999
and

4961.52 --> 4966.1990000000005
any questions

4963.8 --> 4968.12
I mean pretty much done with this

4966.199 --> 4970.46
subject now

4968.12 --> 4974.12
first key chat GTP

4970.46 --> 4975.679
my predictions modeling that the

4974.12 --> 4979.4
standards

4975.679 --> 4981.8
personality matrixes that might become

4979.4 --> 4984.0199999999995
standardized in the future

4981.8 --> 4987.5
and then I talked about

4984.02 --> 4989.860000000001
the Waldorf School culture what that was

4987.5 --> 4995.26
like and the influences in the positive

4989.86 --> 4995.259999999999
influences it has despite it being so

4995.6 --> 5000.900000000001
tough

4997.76 --> 5004.14
right oh my god get the [ __ ] out of here

5000.9 --> 5004.139999999999
just go

5008.14 --> 5012.6
yeah I'm providing good content here

5010.239 --> 5012.599999999999
yeah

5017.92 --> 5023.26
you expect people in the chat to provide

5019.9 --> 5025.96
I'm sorry I'm just expecting them to ask

5023.26 --> 5027.88
questions I'm expecting the people in my

5025.96 --> 5028.96
chat to ask questions because that helps

5027.88 --> 5032.02
a lot

5028.96 --> 5034.78
expect more people in my chapter

5032.02 --> 5037.3
kind of be tuned in to what I'm talking

5034.78 --> 5040.199
about and then interact with me that's

5037.3 --> 5040.1990000000005
what I'm expecting

5040.6 --> 5044.1990000000005
right

5042.04 --> 5048.4
but I also

5044.199 --> 5051.4
need support to get by and if they can't

5048.4 --> 5055.719
provide them then they could help in

5051.4 --> 5057.28
another way which is by promotion if you

5055.719 --> 5058.659
really feel like that I mean if you

5057.28 --> 5061.179
don't feel like that there's no point

5058.659 --> 5064.5599999999995
like I'm not gonna tell you like you

5061.179 --> 5064.56
have to do that even though you're like

5064.78 --> 5069.28
I mean

5066.699 --> 5071.62
I'm just hanging around here right yeah

5069.28 --> 5075.34
that's no point but if you actually feel

5071.62 --> 5076.9
the value of what I do you are getting

5075.34 --> 5080.5
something out of it

5076.9 --> 5083.139999999999
then you could use that inspiration also

5080.5 --> 5085.719
to help spread the word

5083.14 --> 5088.12
in places where you think

5085.719 --> 5091.78
it would really connect up right share

5088.12 --> 5095.4
the show on any platform you deem fit

5091.78 --> 5095.4
I ask that for a reason

5096.58 --> 5099.58
foreign

5110.92 --> 5116.7390000000005
that's not unreasonable right or are you

5114.4 --> 5118.719
ashamed of me is this your secret

5116.739 --> 5120.218999999999
pleasure to come here and chat and you

5118.719 --> 5122.38
don't want to

5120.219 --> 5125.4
mention me out there you think you'll be

5122.38 --> 5125.400000000001
thrown out

5125.98 --> 5129.349999999999
or something

5128.02 --> 5132.589000000001
I don't know did

5129.35 --> 5132.589
[Music]

5135.4 --> 5141.42
it's not unreasonable request

5138.64 --> 5141.42
is it

5142.96 --> 5149.159
it's hard to tell with people not really

5145.78 --> 5149.159
talking in my chat a lot

5150.14 --> 5157.92
[Music]

5152.04 --> 5157.92
then I don't know about the Aladdin AI

5163.12 --> 5168.94
I haven't even used the chat GDP myself

5165.9 --> 5170.799999999999
I'm simply going by other people's

5168.94 --> 5173.919999999999
interactions with it

5170.8 --> 5176.1
that I linked up in this video at the

5173.92 --> 5176.1
start

5180.1 --> 5184.38
I don't know about the Aladdin AI

5195.1 --> 5198.780000000001
yes Orinoco why now

5199.12 --> 5205.239
there's just some people that

5202.179 --> 5207.88
that just really don't want me to have

5205.239 --> 5209.98
it for some reason it just

5207.88 --> 5212.26
I don't know I'm right at this moment

5209.98 --> 5215.259999999999
I'm just taking it like oh so you're

5212.26 --> 5218.5
like trying to wall door of me are you

5215.26 --> 5222.88
you're just being that [ __ ]

5218.5 --> 5226.3
people used to kids around me literally

5222.88 --> 5228.9400000000005
did [ __ ] like that that sort of comment

5226.3 --> 5231.04
oh your [ __ ] you're weak and you can't

5228.94 --> 5235.78
accomplish anything oh why don't you

5231.04 --> 5240.639
just get a job or just give up right

5235.78 --> 5244.0
they would literally say that [ __ ] to me

5240.639 --> 5246.46
like and not just one time but like

5244.0 --> 5248.44
regularly

5246.46 --> 5250.42
and now that I'm kind of zoned into like

5248.44 --> 5253.12
what it was like with the Waldorf I can

5250.42 --> 5254.62
actually kind of let that rub off on me

5253.12 --> 5255.699
and like oh yeah

5254.62 --> 5258.76
so

5255.699 --> 5260.5599999999995
this gas H which I just kicked out for

5258.76 --> 5263.08

Waldorf

5265.54 --> 5269.32
Challenger

5267.34 --> 5271.4400000000005

ridicule me I mean serious go ahead

yeah no [ __ ] Lane and

it's not just oh now they're this return

5389.8 --> 5395.5
no it's it's a sliding slope

5392.5 --> 5400.3
I've argued this with the FED guys too

5395.5 --> 5402.94

the guys like a witch and he's just

5410.44 --> 5417.46
high level intellected like the

5412.719 --> 5419.44
rigorousness that we work with at FD

5417.46 --> 5420.94
there's a lot of people that just they

5419.44 --> 5422.638999999999
want to get along but they just can't

5420.94 --> 5425.739
follow it and it's too heavy for them

5422.639 --> 5427.96
they need they want to tap out and then

5425.739 --> 5429.04
there's bevs and bevs is like oh you can

5427.96 --> 5431.92
be as

5429.04 --> 5433.78
stupid as you like here and I'll even

5431.92 --> 5436.2390000000005

he's literally like a walking

5449.5 --> 5455.139
can't handle fvd intellectually and he

5452.5 --> 5457.659
makes them more stupid

5455.139 --> 5462.1
people that hang around Beth literally

5457.659 --> 5465.099999999999
become Dumber measurably

more lame their energy output numbs down

their enthusiasm Fizzles

5467.739 --> 5474.28
and they become lame zombies

5471.46 --> 5476.56
he collects them makes them

5474.28 --> 5478.54
he's a witch in a cult with a cauldron

5476.56 --> 5480.820000000001
he's stirring the pot continually he

5478.54 --> 5482.56
never stops everybody's staring

5480.82 --> 5486.659
at the pot

he's doing he knows that that's the

globe or flat or anything I don't think

5543.82 --> 5549.759999999999
he cares about anything he's a total

selfish nihilist

he just likes to principle he just likes

5552.94 --> 5558.219
to play Make Believe play so he goes

5556.239 --> 5560.5
along with something to prove oh yeah I

5558.219 --> 5562.96
do get it a bit but he never takes it

5560.5 --> 5566.699
serious he rejects everything is is

5579.34 --> 5583.659000000001
incohesive

situations improvising his way out

they're reasonable

they're spiritually balanced because

that's something I really work on

yeah I do everything that Bev doesn't do

5659.679 --> 5663.179
I have own ideas

5663.82 --> 5670.659
that actually have a point and not are

water is level

oh wow

5674.92 --> 5679.96
I mean such an intellect that that

5677.32 --> 5681.099999999999
requires to come up with that I mean

5679.96 --> 5683.679
that's

5681.1 --> 5686.860000000001
who would have come up with that

5683.679 --> 5689.26
wow water is leveled

5686.86 --> 5690.94
amazing

5689.26 --> 5693.639
yeah

5690.94 --> 5696.46
well I come up with hey

5693.639 --> 5699.52
sun is not a physical object in

5696.46 --> 5701.02
euclidean space huh it's holographic

5699.52 --> 5703.8
yeah yeah

5701.02 --> 5706.780000000001
you try to match that Beth you dumbass

5703.8 --> 5709.179
you can you don't have any ideas you're

5706.78 --> 5711.88
lame you suck

5709.179 --> 5714.82
you're egotistical

5711.88 --> 5717.159000000001
you're a psychopath

5720.82 --> 5725.44
you're the way out you're the ticket out

5722.8 --> 5728.08
of here oh it's too it's too tense so

5725.44 --> 5730.719
you can't handle anywhere too oh I don't

5728.08 --> 5733.719
agree with their attitude oh yeah well I

5730.719 --> 5735.76
think you can go to bed everything is

5733.719 --> 5737.62
always all right oh you don't have to

5735.76 --> 5739.6
make sense anymore you could just be a

5737.62 --> 5742.32

5739.6 --> 5745.679
completely anti-social

[Music]

5758.1 --> 5762.900000000001
yeah

5759.82 --> 5762.9
so go there then

5764.56 --> 5770.8
why do I think this one is holographic

5767.62 --> 5774.84
because it's not an object in euclidean

5770.8 --> 5778.12
space and holographic is the only

5774.84 --> 5780.639
conception I could even think of as an

5778.12 --> 5782.32
alternative to an object in euclidean

5780.639 --> 5783.76
space

5782.32 --> 5785.32
right because they're still there

5783.76 --> 5788.26
there's a lot of light

5785.32 --> 5791.08
but you can't approach it

5788.26 --> 5793.6
it doesn't have any signs of angular

5791.08 --> 5797.92
size change due to perspective

5793.6 --> 5800.38
despite the stupid disc Earth claims

5797.92 --> 5802.84
about oh but it does get smaller in the

5800.38 --> 5805.54
desert yeah [ __ ] because it doesn't

5802.84 --> 5807.6990000000005
match the angular speed so it cannot be

5805.54 --> 5808.6
perspective that's ridiculous to claim

5807.699 --> 5811.12
that

5808.6 --> 5814.06
because then that would mean it would

5811.12 --> 5817.719
suddenly go off in warp at warp speed if

5814.06 --> 5819.52
that angular size is due to it moving

5817.719 --> 5822.82
into the distance it's a [ __ ]

5819.52 --> 5825.46
argument from disc earthers

5822.82 --> 5827.92
it has no relevance it's not an object

5825.46 --> 5832.3
you can approach it and see the angular

5827.92 --> 5834.82
size grow bigger it doesn't happen

5832.3 --> 5837.58
it's always at the edge of your vision

5834.82 --> 5840.4
and it has angular relations that have

5837.58 --> 5843.1
very specific format

5840.4 --> 5844.48
how it happens which you can't approach

5843.1 --> 5846.34
it and the same goes for the moon

5844.48 --> 5848.32
they're all holographic they're all

5846.34 --> 5850.900000000001
lights at the edge of vision that you

5848.32 --> 5852.88
can never actually approach

5850.9 --> 5854.98
that's what it is

5852.88 --> 5858.82
move with you there's only one other

5854.98 --> 5861.5199999999995
thing I know that moves with you

5858.82 --> 5863.92
in your observation

5861.52 --> 5867.52
that's a rainbow

5863.92 --> 5869.56
and that's holographic things

5867.52 --> 5871.620000000001
like

5869.56 --> 5875.38
back to yeah let's

5871.62 --> 5878.0199999999995
it's an optical effect only Optical

5875.38 --> 5879.58
effects move with you when you move like

5878.02 --> 5882.34
a rainbow

5879.58 --> 5885.5199999999995
yeah how is a rainbow even form oh it's

5882.34 --> 5888.34
the light of the celestials the Sun

5885.52 --> 5890.26
getting prism prismified through red

5888.34 --> 5893.88
droplets yeah

5890.26 --> 5893.88
well it moves with you

5897.34 --> 5902.139
because it's light from the sun which

5899.5 --> 5904.12
also does that

5902.139 --> 5908.1990000000005
so it's a unique form of light that

5904.12 --> 5909.46
literally moves with you as you move

5908.199 --> 5913.36
right

5909.46 --> 5916.06
there's no object that casts light

5913.36 --> 5919.179
in the world that does that

5916.06 --> 5922.54
there is none zero

5919.179 --> 5924.76
no object that casts light could have

5922.54 --> 5926.5
this sort of effect or side effect like

5924.76 --> 5930.34
a rainbow that's not possible it's not

5926.5 --> 5933.52
being created Rainbows are unique

5930.34 --> 5935.8
to some light

5933.52 --> 5937.360000000001
right you might get like a prismatic

5935.8 --> 5939.639
light effect

5937.36 --> 5942.42
it's not going to move with you if you

5939.639 --> 5942.42
don't use the Sun

5942.699 --> 5948.04
yeah that's the difference

5945.76 --> 5950.4400000000005
how do I know all this it's comparative

5948.04 --> 5952.78
I literally measurements what the [ __ ]

5950.44 --> 5954.5199999999995
are you blabbering about

5952.78 --> 5957.04
uh

5954.52 --> 5959.620000000001
no it's observation it's literally

5957.04 --> 5961.48
paying attention all my life being

5959.62 --> 5964.12
fascinated with that like why does it do

5961.48 --> 5967.32
that why does it seem like this why is

5964.12 --> 5967.32
it different from everything else

5968.92 --> 5974.7390000000005
why do people keep arguing

5971.739 --> 5978.339999999999
for it to be an object either very far

5974.739 --> 5980.379999999999
away or relatively closer over the disc

5978.34 --> 5983.62
surface right or they keep arguing this

5980.38 --> 5985.78
when there is cracks in the arguments on

5983.62 --> 5989.699
both sides it's incomplete so you're

5985.78 --> 5989.699
both arguing broken arguments

5990.159 --> 5996.58
yeah well my solution was well

5993.4 --> 5999.099999999999
I think that there have been some bias

5996.58 --> 6000.48
issues concerning the nature of this

5999.1 --> 6003.2390000000005
light we see

6000.48 --> 6006.0
think that everybody's insistent

6003.239 --> 6007.98
on assuming that it's a physical object

6006.0 --> 6010.56
in euclidean space that's radiating

6007.98 --> 6012.959999999999
light somehow

6010.56 --> 6016.080000000001
I can't test that notion because there's

6012.96 --> 6018.0
gaps within those assumptions

6016.08 --> 6020.34
in the actual evidence

6018.0 --> 6022.92
and I've pointed all of them out from

6020.34 --> 6026.0
the start since 2015 I've pointed them

6022.92 --> 6026.0
out continually

6028.38 --> 6034.38
and so the conclusion is well it's not

6032.04 --> 6037.86
an objective euclidean space what is it

6034.38 --> 6039.78
then well there's only one other thing

6037.86 --> 6041.759999999999
I could compare it to a sort of and

6039.78 --> 6043.94
that's like a hologram that moves with

6041.76 --> 6043.9400000000005
you

6044.699 --> 6049.138999999999
it's an optical type effect and I just

6047.1 --> 6051.4400000000005
thought like whoa yeah like a hologram

6049.139 --> 6051.4400000000005
then

6051.659 --> 6060.259999999999
so the Hologram word is in that sense a

6055.38 --> 6060.26
naming right it's a name it's not

6060.6 --> 6064.219
a direct indication

6065.04 --> 6070.86
of the mechanics of what it is it's

6067.679 --> 6075.56
simply a Namer that points at this is

6070.86 --> 6075.5599999999995
not a physical object in euclidean space

6078.08 --> 6084.239
how the [ __ ] should I know

6081.659 --> 6085.638999999999
oh immediately the six-year-old

6084.239 --> 6088.259999999999
inquiries

6085.639 --> 6089.82
why the [ __ ] you think why would you

6088.26 --> 6092.219
think that I know that

6089.82 --> 6093.54
which is yours I don't know why the [ __ ]

6092.219 --> 6097.76
should I know

6093.54 --> 6097.76
I'm just going by the parameters

6101.49 --> 6104.728999999999
[Music]

6110.159 --> 6115.5
it's like asking like oh wow

6112.679 --> 6117.78
a human being a piece of life

6115.5 --> 6119.52
where's the designer show me the

6117.78 --> 6123.139
designer right now who designed that

6119.52 --> 6123.139
it's like uh

6123.179 --> 6128.6990000000005
what the [ __ ]

6125.219 --> 6131.76
why what you just expect that it can all

6128.699 --> 6135.239
be answered just like that

6131.76 --> 6137.76
you've been spoiled with scientism where

6135.239 --> 6141.98
there is a suggestion that they do know

6137.76 --> 6141.9800000000005
everything which is an absolute lie

6142.98 --> 6148.739
we don't know everything I don't know

6145.26 --> 6151.1990000000005
what causes the sun mechanically I just

6148.739 --> 6153.239
know the signs

6151.199 --> 6154.379999999999
that I'm getting with the observations

6153.239 --> 6157.86
of it

6154.38 --> 6160.8
and have drawn a conclusion about

6157.86 --> 6162.239
sort of what it could be now that

6160.8 --> 6164.400000000001
doesn't mean oh yeah that could meet

6162.239 --> 6166.5
that immediately means that I could just

6164.4 --> 6168.48
read back engineer I could just make a

6166.5 --> 6170.34
little model and create a mini sun no

6168.48 --> 6172.799999999999
how the [ __ ] should I know how that

6170.34 --> 6175.8
works I just know it's not a physical

6172.8 --> 6178.5
object in eucaly in space

6175.8 --> 6180.900000000001
by the observations why would you assume

6178.5 --> 6182.4
that I immediately know what creating

6180.9 --> 6185.179
that

6182.4 --> 6185.179
the [ __ ]

6188.58 --> 6194.76
okay you were just inquiring yeah

6193.02 --> 6196.09
I wasn't sure where you were going with

6194.76 --> 6198.54
that

6196.09 --> 6201.42
[Music]

6198.54 --> 6205.08
that could never come up yeah no [ __ ]

6201.42 --> 6206.9
no his crown achievement is water is

6205.08 --> 6210.6
level

6206.9 --> 6211.98
wow that's his Grand achievement I mean

6210.6 --> 6215.219
literally

6211.98 --> 6217.44
fifty percent of every now more than

6215.219 --> 6218.4
eighty percent of all people in the

6217.44 --> 6220.86
world

6218.4 --> 6223.259999999999
would be able to figure that one out

6220.86 --> 6224.639
like when they're 12. including the

6223.26 --> 6227.04
really dumb people

6224.639 --> 6229.32
so yeah congratulations on your

6227.04 --> 6232.28
intellectual achievement Bev

6229.32 --> 6232.28
you're an idiot

6234.47 --> 6237.68
[Music]

6251.88 --> 6255.38
it's getting angry yeah it's just

6257.28 --> 6261.9
people keep asking that and then I have

6259.98 --> 6263.759999999999
to keep saying I don't know and it's

6261.9 --> 6265.739
it's just irritating it's irritating

6263.76 --> 6268.219
that everybody just immediately has that

6265.739 --> 6268.218999999999
reflex

6269.88 --> 6274.92
like why would you assume that I would

6272.34 --> 6276.719
know I mean if I would know what is

6274.92 --> 6278.1
building that don't you think I'd have

6276.719 --> 6280.26
like a

6278.1 --> 6283.02
a model drawn out

6280.26 --> 6285.780000000001
and I would have an explanation and I

6283.02 --> 6288.06
would immediately point at that

6285.78 --> 6289.98
regularly

6288.06 --> 6291.54
right well it could yeah if you're

6289.98 --> 6294.119
relatively new here then you wouldn't

6291.54 --> 6297.54
know if I had one or not okay fair

6294.119 --> 6299.159
enough yeah I overreacted a little I

6297.54 --> 6302.5199999999995
just I wasn't sure whether you were

6299.159 --> 6306.86
getting into like troll mode or not

6302.52 --> 6306.860000000001
because I don't really know you yet

6307.02 --> 6311.88
uh

6309.48 --> 6313.5
then don't cool at all what the [ __ ] are

6311.88 --> 6315.659000000001
you talking about get the [ __ ] out of

6313.5 --> 6317.28
here I can't call it whatever the [ __ ] I

6315.659 --> 6321.719
want

6317.28 --> 6324.659
yeah it's a hologram a hologram

6321.719 --> 6327.96
the word gives you a better

6324.659 --> 6330.54
view a more simple View

6327.96 --> 6334.02
that it may not be a physical object

6330.54 --> 6336.84
right it gives you Ed something you can

6334.02 --> 6339.900000000001
at least attempt to visualize to

6336.84 --> 6342.4800000000005
understand your senses concerning it

6339.9 --> 6344.759999999999
yeah I will damn well call it a hologram

6342.48 --> 6346.5599999999995
if I please to I don't know a better

6344.76 --> 6348.780000000001
word

6346.56 --> 6351.900000000001
I do not know a better word if I would

6348.78 --> 6354.54
have to maybe etymological about it you

6351.9 --> 6356.94
know what I end up with a photograph

6354.54 --> 6360.119
well that's going to be very useful yeah

6356.94 --> 6363.9
the sun is a photograph

6360.119 --> 6366.239
what oh that that sounds better does it

6363.9 --> 6368.879999999999
because that's etymologically correct if

6366.239 --> 6372.78
I call it a photograph would it make any

6368.88 --> 6376.679
sense to people no they'd think I just

6372.78 --> 6379.44
sound crazy now if I call it a hologram

6376.679 --> 6383.4
then people can

6379.44 --> 6386.5199999999995
a lot of them get a little bit closer to

6383.4 --> 6389.219
what I'm trying to explain about it

6386.52 --> 6392.1
yeah I'm not gonna stop calling it a

6389.219 --> 6394.44
hologram okay numpty

6392.1 --> 6396.38
who got banned

6394.44 --> 6399.599999999999
all right

6396.38 --> 6403.34
man time is almost done can't believe

6399.6 --> 6403.34
that how much your time flew by

6404.34 --> 6407.659000000001
frequently Asked question

6407.82 --> 6413.5199999999995
maybe yeah

6410.82 --> 6415.5599999999995
I think I even have like that on kiwi's

6413.52 --> 6418.1990000000005
website by the way but I haven't really

6415.56 --> 6421.1
filled it in too much

6418.199 --> 6421.099999999999
but yeah

6421.98 --> 6428.759999999999
but on the other hand I do actually like

6424.86 --> 6432.0599999999995
to just be able to interactively answer

6428.76 --> 6435.119000000001
things so to write it all down

6432.06 --> 6438.780000000001
look insights are actually developing

6435.119 --> 6441.36
further it's like you have this piece in

6438.78 --> 6445.8
a fractal you have the segment that is

6441.36 --> 6449.94
that's solid but as I interactively

6445.8 --> 6452.88
utilize that I do actually find new

6449.94 --> 6457.678999999999
things so if I wrote it down

6452.88 --> 6460.5
I'd be less developing in it than if I

6457.679 --> 6462.119
were to just continually verbally

6460.5 --> 6465.6
communicate it

6462.119 --> 6467.159
but there is a point yes if I want to

6465.6 --> 6469.4400000000005
actually do that then I shouldn't

6467.159 --> 6471.48
overreact like I just did and I

6469.44 --> 6474.0199999999995
apologize about that you were right to

6471.48 --> 6474.0199999999995
point that out

6483.0 --> 6486.619
what are you talking about

6487.739 --> 6494.299999999999
mommy still is wait what where turret

6491.04 --> 6494.3

6504.78 --> 6508.639
a hologram

6506.159 --> 6508.638999999999
yeah

6508.8 --> 6516.679

6511.739 --> 6520.259999999999
it's a visually assisting word it's not

6516.679 --> 6523.159
mechanically physics related literal
