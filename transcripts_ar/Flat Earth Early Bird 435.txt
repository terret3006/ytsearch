6.21 --> 36.549
[Music]

43.82 --> 51.089
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

47.879 --> 53.399
early-bird number 435 I'm your host

51.089 --> 55.32
Arwen and before we start to show please

53.399 --> 57.03
don't forget to share it on any platform

55.32 --> 59.01
you deem fit and if you haven't already

57.03 --> 60.689
subscribed to my channel and it Abell

59.01 --> 63.629
notifications so you know when I'm going

60.689 --> 64.559
live just normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam time

63.629 --> 66.869
every day

64.559 --> 68.939
please also do support me through the

66.869 --> 71.27
paypal patreon my GoFundMe and the super

68.939 --> 75.65899999999999
chats that will be much appreciated

71.27 --> 78.21
so yeah I don't know what it is but my

75.659 --> 79.08000000000001
volume was too high this time so I set

78.21 --> 81.53899999999999
it back to 10

79.08 --> 83.58
maybe it's my voice maybe my voice is

81.539 --> 86.819
slightly different it sounds a bit

83.58 --> 90.56
different to me anyway the weather is

86.819 --> 95.03
kind of the big of big crazy soup and

90.56 --> 101.429
it's not windy or rainy or anything but

95.03 --> 107.25
yeah it's probably not gonna be a lot of

101.429 --> 110.34
Sun around today so yeah today we have

107.25 --> 114.979
green tea and I still have half my

110.34 --> 120.36
tumeric coffee because that was up

114.979 --> 122.7
Tillich's very very late but yeah also I

120.36 --> 126.569
had yesterday was such weird day I was

122.7 --> 130.679
tired as I kind of said and in the

126.569 --> 132.09
afternoon like after the debates I I

130.679 --> 136.55
went to sleep again

132.09 --> 136.55
I slept like

138.78 --> 156.06900000000002
two or three hours then I got up again

142.42 --> 159.42999999999998
and yeah eventually I had right yeah I

156.069 --> 165.129
was in the debates very long up until

159.43 --> 166.18
the ever after show then yeah then I

165.129 --> 168.099
went to sleep

166.18 --> 172.45000000000002
so it was like yeah that makes sense

168.099 --> 175.569
right and Randy while he played it life

172.45 --> 178.92999999999998
afterward and funnily enough it wasn't

175.569 --> 182.70899999999997
as bad as I remember it to be but it was

178.93 --> 187.299
pretty triggered it's with and on

182.709 --> 192.549
because yeah oh you know I was blatantly

187.299 --> 196.56900000000002
obvious as to why if you seen it but

192.549 --> 204.34
yeah I thought overall my back and forth

196.569 --> 208.629
was quite interesting and yeah I don't

204.34 --> 212.739
know it was good and stayed up very very

208.629 --> 216.129
late could stay up because I was

212.739 --> 220.389
relatively rested and yeah anyway it's

216.129 --> 225.17999999999998
just I don't know how today will be for

220.389 --> 225.18
me but I'll find out no I'll find out

227.14 --> 240.04
so let's see who is in Chad George

232.75 --> 243.1
Sanford was first Amanda you with

240.04 --> 250.20999999999998
capital letters I don't know why

243.1 --> 255.6
Ares 106 over moco more colored Ian

250.21 --> 255.6
Adams Ivan van Veen

257.7 --> 260.53999999999996
yeah

266.45 --> 277.71
you don't have to speak for everyone

269.7 --> 282.12
- vanveen pretty sure people have their

277.71 --> 296.27
own motivations to watch me love tidy

282.12 --> 296.27
Womble seeking truth julieopp heaven

309.669 --> 317.229
right anyway michael hart yo you came in

313.81 --> 321.46
right right so anyway again sorry about

317.229 --> 326.62
being bit late basically up that was

321.46 --> 328.74899999999997
sleeping to a half hour before and yeah

326.62 --> 332.919
it's not enough time to prepare it's

328.749 --> 336.279
just not also because i need time to

332.919 --> 339.969
just gradually wake up but I really

336.279 --> 345.12
needed to sleep though and again I'm

339.969 --> 347.439
just noticing how incredibly late

345.12 --> 353.11
relatively the Sun even comes up these

347.439 --> 358.11
days I didn't actually see it even

353.11 --> 358.11
though I was up like way past 7:00

375.62 --> 380.54
yeah Buerkle many shows are late so in

378.74 --> 382.46000000000004
between sleeping might be necessary a

380.54 --> 390.47
lot seemed to work out for me yesterday

382.46 --> 395.29999999999995
I was kind of run out from being pissed

390.47 --> 399.56
off at and um I did have a bit of a call

395.3 --> 402.05
with Adam at a meeting you know kind of

399.56 --> 405.47
like need some emotional support after

402.05 --> 409.37
that because I felt really frustrated

405.47 --> 411.71000000000004
which is also part of what fed into that

409.37 --> 414.41
situation and I even had the opportunity

411.71 --> 419.09
to explain it afterwards on ran teased

414.41 --> 424.28000000000003
and had a pretty good hangout after that

419.09 --> 426.46999999999997
even in the middle of the night yeah

424.28 --> 428.59999999999997
that was pretty interesting up until

426.47 --> 432.05
brenda pretty much came in and i guess

428.6 --> 436.19
people do find it interesting but she

432.05 --> 436.55
was just totally totally nuts totally

436.19 --> 441.04
nuts

436.55 --> 444.02000000000004
yeah at the privilege to point that out

441.04 --> 446.3
but yet stayed up very long and

444.02 --> 451.21999999999997
eventually thought like yeah no it's I'm

446.3 --> 453.62
not gonna keep on being super active and

451.22 --> 458.08000000000004
loud because also I like to keep up my

453.62 --> 458.08
roommates didn't want to do that

462.77 --> 468.5
and on and it's double razorblade

465.44 --> 472.46
experiment yeah it's not really an

468.5 --> 478.24
experiment is it's it's a formal logical

472.46 --> 483.31899999999996
fallacy in a way the wait was that right

478.24 --> 485.81
because I've he's basically referring to

483.319 --> 489.68
textbooks that all say that that

485.81 --> 494.539
fraction happens to waves that fraction

489.68 --> 497.87
happens to light so he then assumes that

494.539 --> 500.77
light is a wave even though the actual

497.87 --> 503.3
wave comparisons that he will use

500.77 --> 505.909
remember the ripples in the pond the

503.3 --> 509.599
actual waves and how that interference

505.909 --> 512.99
pattern then yeah it crosses over and

509.599 --> 517.279
that is like where the wave is double

512.99 --> 520.19
and that crossover pattern of the

517.279 --> 523.37
ripples that is supposedly the

520.19 --> 528.07
interference pattern of the light that

523.37 --> 532.01
is visible but it's it's not really

528.07 --> 534.5200000000001
logical because if it were literal

532.01 --> 534.52
ripples

536.45 --> 544.13
it it doesn't make any sense really

539.089 --> 547.7790000000001
because it's not ripples it's all

544.13 --> 551.81
straight beams that just happen to be

547.779 --> 556.76
distributed at these supposed crossover

551.81 --> 560.709
points but that would mean that there

556.76 --> 565.0699999999999
would be definitely like half the light

560.709 --> 569.959
in between and there's not there's not

565.07 --> 572.089
any light in between so does that mean

569.959 --> 576.05
then that if light would be basically

572.089 --> 579.0100000000001
ripples that light would only be visible

576.05 --> 581.5999999999999
if it would be overlapping with itself

579.01 --> 584.63
with an ax it doesn't make any logical

581.6 --> 588.7900000000001
sense really it's just straight beams

584.63 --> 588.79
and not a wave indeed good servant

590.9 --> 603.04
it's it's such a wide misconception just

599.15 --> 603.04
because the thing can be compared

611.93 --> 614.9599999999999
[Music]

628.06 --> 630.81
all right

630.99 --> 637.05
but anyway by the yeah I basically tried

634.86 --> 640.5
to tackle and on with his arguments of

637.05 --> 643.5
of the pair yet the the pair argument

640.5 --> 646.35
it's everywhere right the fraction says

643.5 --> 649.95
waves light shows their fraction so

646.35 --> 654.78
light must be waves and I basically said

649.95 --> 657.0
well I've heard and was set to be

654.78 --> 660.06
written down that the diffraction

657.0 --> 665.13
pattern would all well also show with

660.06 --> 668.88
things other than light so it would show

665.13 --> 671.1899999999999
the diffraction pattern even when pieces

668.88 --> 675.48
of material were fired through the

671.19 --> 678.0300000000001
double slits so it said so by that

675.48 --> 681.57
standard I fall back to the argument

678.03 --> 683.61
yeah oh you can't really do duce from

681.57 --> 685.38
that interference pattern that light is

683.61 --> 689.28
a wave because other things that are

685.38 --> 691.59
clearly demonstrably not a wave show the

689.28 --> 694.62
pattern as well unfortunately I don't

691.59 --> 696.5400000000001
have the sources for that and I kind of

694.62 --> 699.6
inquired this from John like hey John

696.54 --> 702.8399999999999
maybe could you hand me some some of

699.6 --> 704.85
that so I could actually use that the

702.84 --> 713.5500000000001
shove that in people's face directly and

704.85 --> 716.88
not I don't know just quotes it would be

713.55 --> 719.16
good to get some real upfront visual

716.88 --> 721.47
proof of it for example because then

719.16 --> 725.76
yeah I wouldn't get so frustrated I

721.47 --> 727.62
would literally show it like see it's

725.76 --> 730.38
nice your light your light waves

727.62 --> 732.9
supposedly but here's pieces of matter

730.38 --> 735.15
wave so try to explain that and then

732.9 --> 737.37
maybe maybe he'll just start to do what

735.15 --> 740.84
Brenda didn't say everything is waves my

737.37 --> 744.15
god that discussed it with Brenda

740.84 --> 750.2
material has a frequency therefore it is

744.15 --> 750.1999999999999
waves that was just

751.98 --> 760.59
like Brennan doesn't understand what

755.62 --> 760.59
what waves are so on

805.459 --> 811.459
Marco well the interesting question it

809.0 --> 813.709
complex why isn't the wave pattern

811.459 --> 818.6899999999999
attributed to the matter light interacts

813.709 --> 829.55
with well yeah it's it's a good

818.69 --> 832.7900000000001
realization but it's in yeah technically

829.55 --> 837.5
the matter is that just to be able to

832.79 --> 839.75
reveal what it is it's not a something

837.5 --> 846.17
you can attribute directly to the matter

839.75 --> 849.529
it's it's just regular matter don't

846.17 --> 850.7299999999999
think yeah it's not testing the particle

849.529 --> 853.31
nature it's not like an extra

850.73 --> 857.87
photosensitive plate I think although

853.31 --> 859.9399999999999
with the specific particle lot suppose

857.87 --> 864.05
that light presupposed light particle

859.94 --> 869.2090000000001
tests which are more involved in the the

864.05 --> 871.6099999999999
quantum eraser experiment or the the

869.209 --> 875.209
knowing which path experiment therefore

871.61 --> 878.149
that UD do need a sensitive plate but

875.209 --> 879.9499999999999
just a regular light pattern you can do

878.149 --> 883.07
it in anything is why not does room is

879.95 --> 887.3900000000001
kitchen all the time so you can't

883.07 --> 890.9200000000001
directly attribute that to matter it is

887.39 --> 890.92
the light but

891.429 --> 901.279
yeah for suppose it wave it doesn't

895.519 --> 904.1
really act like a wave at all it just

901.279 --> 909.769
seems to have wave-like

904.1 --> 912.7900000000001
or apparent wave-like properties just as

909.769 --> 917.119
it has apparent particle-like properties

912.79 --> 919.699
in some ways even through experiment

917.119 --> 922.4590000000001
supposedly demonstrated although the yet

919.699 --> 925.8789999999999
guess cow so complex that I'm not up to

922.459 --> 928.9989999999999
the task to even figure out that at this

925.879 --> 932.6
point how valid that would be I will

928.999 --> 934.5400000000001
eventually I'm pretty certain of it but

932.6 --> 938.239
yeah I think that my preliminary

934.54 --> 940.3389999999999
conclusion was pretty good it came up

938.239 --> 942.0790000000001
with Brenda basically started claiming

940.339 --> 943.489
her light is both the wave and a

942.079 --> 948.459
particle and I said that's a

943.489 --> 952.5400000000001
contradiction said it's illogical

948.459 --> 955.7589999999999
because they are fundamentally different

952.54 --> 959.059
you know you can't be both at the same

955.759 --> 961.549
time even though you have properties of

959.059 --> 965.36
both things just means there is

961.549 --> 968.8389999999999
something else there is naturally a

965.36 --> 971.059
third thing that is neither this

968.839 --> 974.749
particle nor a wave but seems to have

971.059 --> 980.709
properties of both to then conclude that

974.749 --> 980.7090000000001
it is both is crazy my opinion

985.24 --> 990.4
Gideon's sick light is a field

990.88 --> 1000.28
perturbation perturbation what I don't

994.31 --> 1003.64
even know what that word means I don't

1000.28 --> 1005.5899999999999
know is it a field is that what

1003.64 --> 1010.39
individual light things are I don't know

1005.59 --> 1012.25
a field again is is just like waves it's

1010.39 --> 1016.3
a secondary thing it's a thing of

1012.25 --> 1019.27
something and this question is about

1016.3 --> 1022.9499999999999
what is that something what is the light

1019.27 --> 1028.23
itself what is the building block of the

1022.95 --> 1028.23
process of the visuals of light

1043.43 --> 1050.93
all right well mark colored well that is

1046.91 --> 1054.0400000000002
very demonstratable what sounds make

1050.93 --> 1059.6000000000001
what sound makes the air look like

1054.04 --> 1065.48
because sound patterns sound frequencies

1059.6 --> 1070.1599999999999
are very predictable how that works how

1065.48 --> 1072.71
it will this is all cymatics this is

1070.16 --> 1074.5700000000002
based the people that really know and

1072.71 --> 1077.0
figure out the exact patterns the

1074.57 --> 1080.0
pressure distribution patterns that will

1077.0 --> 1083.06
rearrange the de pressures within the

1080.0 --> 1086.09
medium due to the sound oscillation and

1083.06 --> 1088.82
all that it is very predictable and can

1086.09 --> 1090.9499999999998
be made visual it's like when you do it

1088.82 --> 1094.6399999999999
on the plate like with sand or anything

1090.95 --> 1097.3700000000001
then how descend redistributes itself on

1094.64 --> 1100.19
the plate kind of shows how the

1097.37 --> 1103.55
pressures are being this redistributed

1100.19 --> 1107.18
because of the sound waves because yeah

1103.55 --> 1110.8999999999999
the sound oscillation and all that right

1107.18 --> 1114.4
above the plate so cymatics is a good

1110.9 --> 1117.8000000000002
way to show how the pressures are

1114.4 --> 1121.66
redistributed because of the yeah

1117.8 --> 1121.6599999999999
because of the sound frequencies

1139.81 --> 1146.51
okay gleam I still that that word Li

1145.16 --> 1157.5800000000002
means very little to me

1146.51 --> 1160.36
Oh Google it just to see a little bit

1157.58 --> 1160.36
more about it

1168.18 --> 1175.8400000000001
okay number one says anxiety mental and

1172.6 --> 1178.6599999999999
easiness there's no pictures right and a

1175.84 --> 1181.09
second a deviation of a system of an

1178.66 --> 1182.89
object or process from its regular or

1181.09 --> 1186.28
normal state of path caused by an

1182.89 --> 1194.5300000000002
outside influence that's probably the

1186.28 --> 1196.42
one so it is technically an influence by

1194.53 --> 1198.81
an outside effect there could be a lot

1196.42 --> 1198.8100000000002
of things

1207.47 --> 1213.59
no interesting in the Wikipedia it

1209.659 --> 1216.669
starts to refer to models about modeling

1213.59 --> 1224.269
things that cannot be proven or

1216.669 --> 1227.419
waitthat's perturbation theory seems to

1224.269 --> 1231.799
be a lot of perturbation in different

1227.419 --> 1238.039
fields the geology astronomy and quantum

1231.799 --> 1241.99
mechanics ok the biology well very

1238.039 --> 1246.62
telling with astronomy and geology

1241.99 --> 1248.36
nature of alluvial deposit like yeah

1246.62 --> 1250.37
thinks that they can't actually check

1248.36 --> 1252.2299999999998
what they scan it and then they deduce

1250.37 --> 1253.879
through the frequencies what it should

1252.23 --> 1256.33
be like blah blah blah

1253.879 --> 1258.6789999999999
I guess that is definitely perturbation

1256.33 --> 1262.309
it's affected by something but they

1258.679 --> 1267.8790000000001
can't test it and yeah astronomy is

1262.309 --> 1272.289
blatantly obvious anyway interesting

1267.879 --> 1272.289
meaning of words can be very interesting

1294.44 --> 1300.38
what colored like how energy passes

1297.95 --> 1302.9
through water as waves yet the water

1300.38 --> 1305.44
doesn't really move only the energy

1302.9 --> 1305.44
moves

1309.11 --> 1317.3
yeah but see that that's just it it mu

1313.28 --> 1320.6299999999999
that's the idea light in ways moves as

1317.3 --> 1325.06
waves but that doesn't make any sense

1320.63 --> 1330.2
because a wave in its own nature is

1325.06 --> 1332.84
secondary so that's where then a lot of

1330.2 --> 1334.73
speculators and Fanta cysts bring in the

1332.84 --> 1336.9199999999998
ether concept like oh if it is a wave

1334.73 --> 1338.48
then what is it waving because it's

1336.92 --> 1342.44
doing something separate it worked in a

1338.48 --> 1344.03
vacuum is it waving the ether basically

1342.44 --> 1348.68
that yeah that's how that then comes

1344.03 --> 1352.75
into being but the thing is it the

1348.68 --> 1357.29
substance seems to be almost like a wave

1352.75 --> 1360.38
perpetuating something in this case deep

1357.29 --> 1363.17
presume the ether or whatever but it's

1360.38 --> 1366.8500000000001
not really comparable because that's the

1363.17 --> 1371.3000000000002
only example where this substance itself

1366.85 --> 1373.1599999999999
seems to act like a wave but it is a

1371.3 --> 1378.02
substance itself and that's the only

1373.16 --> 1380.93
thing where that case is actual where

1378.02 --> 1384.56
it's its own thing yet seems to be act

1380.93 --> 1390.1100000000001
like a wave comparable it's the only

1384.56 --> 1395.4199999999998
example right something I tried to get

1390.11 --> 1398.4399999999998
through on rant is yesterday two people

1395.42 --> 1398.44
seem to be overlooking that

1403.98 --> 1410.46
oh sure gleam sure whatever you say

1407.94 --> 1412.409
ether has been proven they called

1410.46 --> 1418.08
virtual photo tell me what sounds all

1412.409 --> 1420.3600000000001
very gravity ish you know I really feel

1418.08 --> 1423.09
more and more and more that ether is the

1420.36 --> 1426.269
other is it is the next level aberration

1423.09 --> 1429.2099999999998
just like gravity was still is by the

1426.269 --> 1433.59
way it just seems it's a big

1429.21 --> 1437.429
misunderstanding and based upon that

1433.59 --> 1441.84
misunderstanding people figure out that

1437.429 --> 1444.539
there has to be a medium and then medium

1441.84 --> 1448.529
must then be ether because people have

1444.539 --> 1451.58
talked about it before so and that's

1448.529 --> 1451.58
typical aberration

1460.09 --> 1468.9599999999998
fear joy photons is like the gravitons

1465.09 --> 1473.6799999999998
so another like virtual photons

1468.96 --> 1478.48
gravitons these are very remote

1473.68 --> 1480.7
conceptual things that have to that

1478.48 --> 1483.46
already sound kind of techno babble ish

1480.7 --> 1486.5800000000002
and that is suspect just goes to show

1483.46 --> 1491.77
that when those types of things are

1486.58 --> 1495.6999999999998
added into the body of science as it

1491.77 --> 1499.3799999999999
were that things become very very far

1495.7 --> 1499.38
away from actual reality

1509.72 --> 1516.3600000000001
okay clean fuel combined light and

1513.99 --> 1525.24
energy light energy and electricity

1516.36 --> 1533.34
energy you get more than both I I don't

1525.24 --> 1537.75
that seems like quite a claim really but

1533.34 --> 1543.11
again I think that even that the idea

1537.75 --> 1546.84
that more energy would come from a

1543.11 --> 1550.9499999999998
certain mechanical process right I think

1546.84 --> 1553.02
that idea of the ether like hey there's

1550.95 --> 1555.21
this energy coming from somewhere that

1553.02 --> 1556.95
doesn't seem to be coming from the

1555.21 --> 1559.919
normal energies or the process of the

1556.95 --> 1561.179
material that chemical recht right well

1559.919 --> 1563.76
that idea is something completely

1561.179 --> 1568.95
different that's the electric either as

1563.76 --> 1571.62
it were deep and I think that that is a

1568.95 --> 1574.89
viable concept I think there is like an

1571.62 --> 1578.1899999999998
electric field everywhere just as part

1574.89 --> 1581.5800000000002
of the design of the realm that certain

1578.19 --> 1587.669
processes are basically resting upon

1581.58 --> 1589.9189999999999
tapping into to provide the energy or

1587.669 --> 1597.99
extra energy to make things work as it

1589.919 --> 1600.659
were but that's not a medium for things

1597.99 --> 1605.58
to do for things like light to manifest

1600.659 --> 1610.0490000000002
or emotion medium for light to be a wave

1605.58 --> 1612.09
it's simply a backdrop electrical

1610.049 --> 1617.789
battery as it were and certain

1612.09 --> 1619.77
conditions allow a connection to that

1617.789 --> 1624.09
energy and some of the energy to be

1619.77 --> 1627.45
transferred and I think that the same

1624.09 --> 1634.309
way goes that energy also probably goes

1627.45 --> 1634.309
back back into the ether

1639.35 --> 1648.07
what is it filled yeah that's difficult

1650.79 --> 1660.12
a field I guess is a a secondary thing

1656.6 --> 1662.8999999999999
Eden in our in examples that we can make

1660.12 --> 1667.1689999999999
a second it's also a bit like waviness

1662.9 --> 1671.4
it's a secondary effect involving

1667.169 --> 1674.16
energies of certain types that are kind

1671.4 --> 1677.88
of kept in place as they are in a stable

1674.16 --> 1680.309
fashion surrounding a certain piece of

1677.88 --> 1683.8200000000002
material like for example a magnetic

1680.309 --> 1686.73
field I think that is kind of what

1683.82 --> 1691.6789999999999
defines a field again it's also

1686.73 --> 1694.6200000000001
secondary in a way because I don't know

1691.679 --> 1700.65
any field that can exist without some

1694.62 --> 1702.9289999999999
kind of matter keeping it as a field if

1700.65 --> 1705.0900000000001
you know what I mean and by that

1702.929 --> 1707.7900000000002
standard the conceptualization of the

1705.09 --> 1711.35
electric backdrop ether that's not a

1707.79 --> 1715.62
medium for waves it's just as an extra

1711.35 --> 1718.799
electrical backdrop source that involves

1715.62 --> 1720.84
itself interacts back a fourth probably

1718.799 --> 1727.9189999999999
has to because energy conservation and

1720.84 --> 1731.79
all that and that field which it

1727.919 --> 1734.6100000000001
probably is it would be kind of almost

1731.79 --> 1737.6689999999999
like a side effect to the matter itself

1734.61 --> 1740.79
maybe maybe the ether is there because

1737.669 --> 1745.679
matter is there it's things like become

1740.79 --> 1749.24
quite complex here that's the

1745.679 --> 1749.24
description or the definition of

1759.58 --> 1763.6499999999999
[Music]

1768.71 --> 1772.249
[Music]

1804.57 --> 1811.07
can't always be slower and light went in

1808.92 --> 1811.0700000000002
it

1818.67 --> 1823.98
okay Gideon SiC if you say so I don't

1822.09 --> 1826.59
know now you made me kind of curious is

1823.98 --> 1830.72
it that difficult so when I just Google

1826.59 --> 1830.72
field or the definition of a field

1841.41 --> 1845.89
[Music]

1854.47 --> 1858.21
Oh huh

1863.69 --> 1871.01
wow there's a lot oh wait yeah the

1867.89 --> 1873.4
physics definition of a field the region

1871.01 --> 1876.14
in which a particular condition prevails

1873.4 --> 1878.96
especially one in which a force or

1876.14 --> 1884.0500000000002
influences effective regardless of the

1878.96 --> 1891.53
presence or absence of a material medium

1884.05 --> 1893.81
okay oh oh okay

1891.53 --> 1896.51
well I guess that by that standard my

1893.81 --> 1899.03
idea of a field as a second everything

1896.51 --> 1901.31
to matter doesn't really apply although

1899.03 --> 1904.58
I don't know any examples of fields that

1901.31 --> 1908.1499999999999
can sustain themselves without some kind

1904.58 --> 1913.6299999999999
of material influence doesn't exactly

1908.15 --> 1913.63
link to that so

1928.459 --> 1931.459
it

1937.62 --> 1946.789
I did read out find seek and find what I

1942.96 --> 1949.32
lit I read out what I searched for it's

1946.789 --> 1950.94
not just gonna search something and then

1949.32 --> 1955.289
not say what I'm gonna search when I do

1950.94 --> 1959.5800000000002
with life on there or did you mean that

1955.289 --> 1963.11
I should show that's a good point but

1959.58 --> 1963.11
that takes some preparation

1964.15 --> 1967.3090000000002
[Music]

1984.85 --> 1993.6999999999998
right yeah as for comments I agrees he

1988.509 --> 1997.45
can find I should make it a habit to

1993.7 --> 2000.48
read out if I'm gonna respond to a

1997.45 --> 2004.6490000000001
comment and I I do it like half of the

2000.48 --> 2006.919
times problem is that I usually just

2004.649 --> 2009.1789999999999
want to immediately respond and

2006.919 --> 2010.529
sometimes it goes really rapidly that

2009.179 --> 2012.0590000000002
just don't have time it would take too

2010.529 --> 2017.12
much time to keep on reading everything

2012.059 --> 2021.72
and besides it should be visible right

2017.12 --> 2024.2689999999998
next to me in the special text box so

2021.72 --> 2027.659
it's immortalized so if people really

2024.269 --> 2029.49
want to figure out what I am responding

2027.659 --> 2031.2
to when I am and I don't read it out

2029.49 --> 2034.98
they can just pause it and look through

2031.2 --> 2036.72
the comments usually like wait for 30

2034.98 --> 2039.6
seconds or something then you'll be sure

2036.72 --> 2043.3790000000001
to see it probably so they can read it

2039.6 --> 2045.1789999999999
back because otherwise they there would

2043.379 --> 2049.29
be no way for them to figure out what I

2045.179 --> 2051.329
was saying there's no guarantee that for

2049.29 --> 2054.329
example the YouTube chat is visible

2051.329 --> 2057.389
sometimes it just won't pop up it's just

2054.329 --> 2059.76
is just broken won't show anything or

2057.389 --> 2062.28
just show one single person commenting

2059.76 --> 2066.96
it's weird how it works sometimes but

2062.28 --> 2069.98
yeah the actual in video chat that's

2066.96 --> 2069.98
always going to be there

2072.49 --> 2079.0
Oh God Mary Tyler Moore No yeah I heard

2076.75 --> 2082.24
in chat like oh this is gonna be a troll

2079.0 --> 2088.48
vs. troll thing okay sure

2082.24 --> 2090.5499999999997
now I'm gonna hear the thing where I got

2088.48 --> 2092.349
really loud with a nominal hello there

2090.55 --> 2094.57
gonna echo it and then it's gonna make

2092.349 --> 2097.599
their own ooh little ouch music or

2094.57 --> 2105.1600000000003
whatever I don't know man I don't know

2097.599 --> 2106.9900000000002
what the [ __ ] the problem is really did

2105.16 --> 2111.04
you hear freaking a non giggle

2106.99 --> 2113.6499999999996
afterwards that was that was naughty

2111.04 --> 2115.54
he wasn't even winning the argument but

2113.65 --> 2118.21
he just thought it was funny that I that

2115.54 --> 2121.599
I was getting angry to him he thought it

2118.21 --> 2123.46
was funny because he didn't understand

2121.599 --> 2125.8
why I was getting pissed off at him

2123.46 --> 2128.26
because I was getting pissed off at him

2125.8 --> 2130.63
even though I was saying it to his face

2128.26 --> 2132.76
he wasn't listening I was getting pissed

2130.63 --> 2135.07
off because I kept on explaining the

2132.76 --> 2138.82
intricate details and he wouldn't even

2135.07 --> 2139.57
feed me back that he got my argument he

2138.82 --> 2142.03
wouldn't do it

2139.57 --> 2148.3
it was acting like a freakin baller all

2142.03 --> 2150.28
that pisses me off badly so and he

2148.3 --> 2153.6400000000003
didn't understand it so he was just

2150.28 --> 2160.599
giggling Wow or in his upset oh that's

2153.64 --> 2164.609
so funny so funny you know I don't get

2160.599 --> 2170.26
angry likely people may have noticed

2164.609 --> 2172.9
it's just being a dumb [ __ ] and on was

2170.26 --> 2176.44
really being a dumb idiot

2172.9 --> 2178.69
and you thought it was funny it was

2176.44 --> 2182.77
funny that somebody gets pissed off at

2178.69 --> 2184.75
him overlooking that is literally not

2182.77 --> 2187.2599999999998
understanding a word I'm saying because

2184.75 --> 2191.05
he doesn't feed it back to me I couldn't

2187.26 --> 2194.5
not really just yeah he couldn't say it

2191.05 --> 2196.9900000000002
because you have to put out my stupid

2194.5 --> 2199.359
like being a wave story about ripples

2196.99 --> 2201.8489999999997
and bombs and all that [ __ ] nonsense

2199.359 --> 2203.95
that I keep refuting then I keep

2201.849 --> 2205.7000000000003
literally explaining why it's not that

2203.95 --> 2208.64
it just doesn't

2205.7 --> 2211.5499999999997
respond just keeps on asserting the same

2208.64 --> 2216.89
[ __ ] over and over and over and over

2211.55 --> 2220.07
again for years years it's the same it

2216.89 --> 2223.37
doesn't update it he doesn't evolve yeah

2220.07 --> 2225.8
he copy/paste some stupid ken wheeler

2223.37 --> 2228.0499999999997
[ __ ] or something some ridiculous techno

2225.8 --> 2230.3300000000004
babble and you just copy paste that as

2228.05 --> 2232.07
is because he doesn't really understand

2230.33 --> 2235.58
that [ __ ] either it just thinks it

2232.07 --> 2237.6200000000003
sounds really smart because it doesn't

2235.58 --> 2240.41
know what the hell he's doing he doesn't

2237.62 --> 2244.49
have a real oversight he's mechanics or

2240.41 --> 2247.79
he would actually respond to the

2244.49 --> 2250.58
arguments and he would with me to the

2247.79 --> 2252.5299999999997
same level sit sit be there be more

2250.58 --> 2254.7799999999997
collie like a colleague and actually

2252.53 --> 2257.3
recognize yet it there is some really

2254.78 --> 2260.3900000000003
complex issues here but it's like how it

2257.3 --> 2264.7400000000002
does indeed seem to respond like both

2260.39 --> 2268.31
things it doesn't even get into that no

2264.74 --> 2270.1099999999997
oh and anything that touches upon that

2268.31 --> 2273.14
subject the only thing he does is what

2270.11 --> 2276.11
parlors do it just waits then he starts

2273.14 --> 2278.75
to assert his nonsense stories about

2276.11 --> 2281.1200000000003
ripples and ponds and look oh it's in

2278.75 --> 2284.48
the kitchen oh oh I think I'm so smart

2281.12 --> 2289.7799999999997
because I think that this proves that

2284.48 --> 2292.58
light is waves a total [ __ ]

2289.78 --> 2297.4100000000003
literally doesn't know what the hell

2292.58 --> 2300.04
he's doing and he's a universal dumbass

2297.41 --> 2302.93
because that [ __ ]

2300.04 --> 2305.99
it doesn't believe in anything he's

2302.93 --> 2307.73
freaking atheist he doesn't understand

2305.99 --> 2310.7299999999996
frequencies it doesn't understand

2307.73 --> 2315.7
influences of what he does he is

2310.73 --> 2318.27
practically just like an atheist hollow

2315.7 --> 2320.97
senseless

2318.27 --> 2323.31
no feel for things no feel for what's

2320.97 --> 2326.9399999999996
actually going on oh just distracted by

2323.31 --> 2329.45
very short-term priorities is typical

2326.94 --> 2329.4500000000003
atheist

2337.18 --> 2340.2799999999997
[Music]

2340.73 --> 2346.96
yeah Mary Tyler Moore yeah that's that's

2344.45 --> 2346.96
just it

2356.55 --> 2365.28
it's like yeah I'm pretty sure that I

2361.68 --> 2369.45
know I shouldn't go there no that's

2365.28 --> 2373.8
enough you know a non stupidity is bad

2369.45 --> 2376.1099999999997
enough as it is but I think that we're

2373.8 --> 2379.92
probably not the only one that he annoys

2376.11 --> 2381.9300000000003
to know and I'm pretty sure that anyone

2379.92 --> 2385.17
that he does this is not the only

2381.93 --> 2387.0
subject he gets like this with I think

2385.17 --> 2390.06
that a lot of people that know him and

2387.0 --> 2392.88
kind of like to like him don't go into

2390.06 --> 2395.4
discussion with him because that brings

2392.88 --> 2398.1600000000003
out the worst and people don't want to

2395.4 --> 2399.96
deal with that naturally I don't want to

2398.16 --> 2401.8799999999997
deal with it when unfortunately I'm

2399.96 --> 2408.17
dealing in these subjects and I can't

2401.88 --> 2411.21
keep an on out or in the typical panels

2408.17 --> 2415.86
at the yeah at the debates and all that

2411.21 --> 2417.7200000000003
I can do it here but that was kind of

2415.86 --> 2420.54
why my remark is why is this guy still

2417.72 --> 2425.04
life because he's so freaking annoying

2420.54 --> 2428.52
and so death to reason that that would

2425.04 --> 2430.5299999999997
probably cause certain situations where

2428.52 --> 2432.5099999999998
even potential family would just want to

2430.53 --> 2435.65
strangle the guy like why don't you

2432.51 --> 2440.5200000000004
freaking lesson why are you being such a

2435.65 --> 2442.17
dumbass Rock that's what I was referring

2440.52 --> 2444.72
to you nuts

2442.17 --> 2448.92
people like that never commit suicide

2444.72 --> 2451.1299999999997
there they can't even feel the weight in

2448.92 --> 2454.14
order to get to that point

2451.13 --> 2456.96
suicide requires some certain depths

2454.14 --> 2464.5699999999997
some pressure depths and he doesn't get

2456.96 --> 2464.57
it it's too dumb for it yeah

2475.4 --> 2479.569
anyway enough about that

2512.67 --> 2517.07
all right Mary Tyler Moore yeah

2521.69 --> 2528.38
well in a way you know again

2526.24 --> 2532.089
backtracking a little not saying that I

2528.38 --> 2535.819
was incorrect but I think that a nun is

2532.089 --> 2538.0099999999998
he started out in this [ __ ] being quite

2535.819 --> 2540.619
like the oppositional defiant person a

2538.01 --> 2543.8190000000004
bit bit like a cellphone yeah well he is

2540.619 --> 2548.089
a freaking Suhani okay it's just yes

2543.819 --> 2549.799
blatantly obvious but this is a Vanya

2548.089 --> 2553.099
typically what you do is you take in a

2549.799 --> 2555.52
position of position to anyone and then

2553.099 --> 2559.039
you just start hammering that and

2555.52 --> 2562.849
ignoring the rebuttals because a lot of

2559.039 --> 2564.9500000000003
it is going to be yeah also Egon

2562.849 --> 2567.26
ego-driven it's like getting the the

2564.95 --> 2569.5099999999998
nuisance out of the way and that causes

2567.26 --> 2572.63
if you keep on doing that over and over

2569.51 --> 2575.8390000000004
and over and over again it conditions

2572.63 --> 2577.819
the individual that does that to

2575.839 --> 2580.49
literally ignore everything in the

2577.819 --> 2583.16
process it becomes like a mode where you

2580.49 --> 2585.41
start to assert the thing and actively

2583.16 --> 2587.48
ignore things and then eventually it

2585.41 --> 2588.95
becomes almost impossible for that

2587.48 --> 2591.049
individual when they forward their

2588.95 --> 2594.5
concept to listen to the other person

2591.049 --> 2597.44
it's like conditioning that originates

2594.5 --> 2600.23
in a defensive posture and doing it over

2597.44 --> 2602.96
and over and over again it's a problem

2600.23 --> 2605.569
that's why people shouldn't do that you

2602.96 --> 2609.71
shouldn't start out doing that so Vanya

2605.569 --> 2611.029
is useless that attitude can work for a

2609.71 --> 2612.65
very short time but if you're going to

2611.029 --> 2617.15
systematically apply it you're gonna

2612.65 --> 2619.88
literally numb your sensibility down and

2617.15 --> 2622.7000000000003
you're gonna isolate your insights

2619.88 --> 2625.609
because you're actively conditioned to

2622.7 --> 2627.2
ignore other people's rebuttal and just

2625.609 --> 2632.0789999999997
assert your [ __ ] over and over and over

2627.2 --> 2632.0789999999997
again and that's part of a nonce problem

2632.589 --> 2640.97
he's just been too stubborn and now he

2635.839 --> 2643.49
can't listen it is like a syndrome deaf

2640.97 --> 2646.22
ears syndrome like you've just

2643.49 --> 2648.799
conditioned yourself to not listen so

2646.22 --> 2651.83
long you can't listen anymore even if

2648.799 --> 2655.19
you tried just it

2651.83 --> 2658.27
it gets in the way the conditioning from

2655.19 --> 2661.84
the defensive mode prevents you from

2658.27 --> 2664.82
actually processing the information

2661.84 --> 2666.59
besides just hearing that something is

2664.82 --> 2674.8700000000003
being said and waiting until it stops so

2666.59 --> 2677.6000000000004
you can assert your [ __ ] yeah and laid

2674.87 --> 2679.7599999999998
me off is also that yeah ballers typical

2677.6 --> 2682.19
ballers the the bad ones that the

2679.76 --> 2686.21
tenacious ones rumpus brenda they all do

2682.19 --> 2689.15
that systematically perpetually it is

2686.21 --> 2695.93
what they do and pretty much the only

2689.15 --> 2698.6600000000003
thing they do because they are embracing

2695.93 --> 2700.7
the defensive conditioning like you're

2698.66 --> 2703.49
supposed to they are literally doing the

2700.7 --> 2705.5299999999997
numbing down religiously because they

2703.49 --> 2707.72
think that you're supposed to do that

2705.53 --> 2712.3700000000003
because the people that do that do

2707.72 --> 2714.3999999999996
manage to keep the faith in the ball so

2712.37 --> 2716.5699999999997
you have to do that or you lose faith

2714.4 --> 2719.36
don't understand you have to understand

2716.57 --> 2721.9100000000003
why just have to see how people do

2719.36 --> 2723.53
certain things feel it feel it out and

2721.91 --> 2727.37
then see the result you don't have to

2723.53 --> 2734.8700000000003
understand in order to get that view of

2727.37 --> 2737.93
it it's the cognitive dissonance take it

2734.87 --> 2741.7999999999997
completely rearranges how you view

2737.93 --> 2745.2799999999997
things and what information you take

2741.8 --> 2748.9700000000003
from things and let it enter your

2745.28 --> 2752.8100000000004
consciousness it rearranges this and you

2748.97 --> 2755.0299999999997
get like a subview it's very very

2752.81 --> 2759.58
different from actual critical thought

2755.03 --> 2759.5800000000004
based reasoning state of mind

2762.58 --> 2765.73
[Music]

2767.38 --> 2772.94
now thanks to Mary Tyler Moore I really

2770.45 --> 2775.819
appreciate that comment I'll read it out

2772.94 --> 2777.799
I get annoyed when people like him and

2775.819 --> 2780.079
kiwi don't give you the respect you

2777.799 --> 2781.819
deserve especially knowing how long you

2780.079 --> 2783.829
have done this and the knowledge you

2781.819 --> 2786.849
bring to the argument I'm glad you stand

2783.829 --> 2791.9300000000003
for truth I really appreciate that

2786.849 --> 2796.5190000000002
and yeah I can't annoy it too but it's

2791.93 --> 2799.359
like I just figure out again if you're

2796.519 --> 2803.18
really digging deep if you're really

2799.359 --> 2806.769
wielding the pure light then the dark

2803.18 --> 2810.109
stains in others will rise up and

2806.769 --> 2812.299
utilize the individual even though they

2810.109 --> 2814.5789999999997
may on a lot of fields be pure the

2812.299 --> 2820.49
impurities will rise to the occasion

2814.579 --> 2823.4300000000003
to assert demonic stuff in in that new

2820.49 --> 2826.25
frequency that's not been opened yet to

2823.43 --> 2828.589
the consciousness of these people so

2826.25 --> 2830.839
yeah every time you break into some new

2828.589 --> 2834.71
insights that that's actually effective

2830.839 --> 2837.17
there will naturally be counter

2834.71 --> 2840.44
responses and those counter responses

2837.17 --> 2842.1800000000003
will mostly at first be that people just

2840.44 --> 2843.859
won't understand what you're saying and

2842.18 --> 2845.3489999999997
they'll just say oh that sounds kind of

2843.859 --> 2847.279
interesting I don't get it though

2845.349 --> 2850.9100000000003
doesn't have to be negative and then

2847.279 --> 2852.5
eventually when the understanding starts

2850.91 --> 2857.23
to sink in more and more then some

2852.5 --> 2859.64
people may arise and just don't like it

2857.23 --> 2863.69
because it kind of almost feels like Oh

2859.64 --> 2868.16
more work in a way and then they will

2863.69 --> 2870.619
start to counter argue it because they

2868.16 --> 2872.509
don't like it not because they don't

2870.619 --> 2874.309
necessarily technically agree because

2872.509 --> 2878.75
they don't have to fall inside yet and

2874.309 --> 2882.529
so that keeps on moving over time people

2878.75 --> 2885.079
get used to it and then suddenly yeah

2882.529 --> 2888.559
they won't just let it pass by they will

2885.079 --> 2892.819
actually four in yet respond to it and

2888.559 --> 2895.7400000000002
then later even maybe partially agree

2892.819 --> 2898.32
and expand upon it or show some new

2895.74 --> 2898.9799999999996
problems that for example I haven't seen

2898.32 --> 2901.32
before

2898.98 --> 2902.94
and I haven't thought of no it's open

2901.32 --> 2904.98
for that it's like oh you want you've

2902.94 --> 2906.7200000000003
got a new angle that that I haven't

2904.98 --> 2908.849
actually addressed that I overlooked

2906.72 --> 2915.45
what is it tell me tell me I want to

2908.849 --> 2917.76
know because I want more but it has to

2915.45 --> 2920.58
be sensible though because if it's

2917.76 --> 2923.3100000000004
immediately gonna be driving in more

2920.58 --> 2926.31
presuppositions like ooh some kind of

2923.31 --> 2929.849
quantum mechanical presupposition that's

2926.31 --> 2934.13
grounded as a proof for the argument

2929.849 --> 2934.13
then it's not gonna really help a lot

2938.78 --> 2942.2000000000003
but anyway

2944.01 --> 2949.5600000000004
yet they do what they do and I'm used to

2947.49 --> 2952.68
it I don't like it but at the same time

2949.56 --> 2955.0499999999997
I'm taking it as a sign that I am still

2952.68 --> 2957.7799999999997
effective that I at least haven't turned

2955.05 --> 2960.1800000000003
into some yes-man you know that's like

2957.78 --> 2962.4900000000002
the worst outcome I can imagine that I'd

2960.18 --> 2964.89
become completely superfluous because I

2962.49 --> 2966.72
just be saying yeah yeah yeah and

2964.89 --> 2968.27
repeating the same thing to be part of

2966.72 --> 2972.089
the group Oh God

2968.27 --> 2980.07
couldn't imagine the shame I'd be

2972.089 --> 2982.71
feeling no I have to oppose this

2980.07 --> 2985.71
it's almost compulsively I just tried to

2982.71 --> 2987.03
not constantly do it you know there's a

2985.71 --> 2989.25
time and a place for everything and

2987.03 --> 2992.579
there's moments people expect me to

2989.25 --> 2994.5
oppose because I do it and there's

2992.579 --> 2996.329
moments where I just shouldn't get

2994.5 --> 2999.27
involved and I'm learning more and more

2996.329 --> 3002.42
in which moments to pick because I used

2999.27 --> 3004.4
to basically get in the way a lot a lot

3002.42 --> 3006.29
especially before the early bird show

3004.4 --> 3008.359
that the debates would constantly do

3006.29 --> 3010.7599999999998
that and there was getting annoying here

3008.359 --> 3013.31
and there I even agreed now what I'm

3010.76 --> 3016.099
doing is a little bit less I wait I wait

3013.31 --> 3022.359
for my moments don't always get it right

3016.099 --> 3025.25
but yeah that way people are more an

3022.359 --> 3028.64
anticipatory is that even a word they

3025.25 --> 3031.369
anticipate what I do more because I

3028.64 --> 3035.42
don't do it constantly doesn't people

3031.369 --> 3037.67
will then start to expect it anyway I'm

3035.42 --> 3041.42
gonna round out the show sorry for being

3037.67 --> 3047.089
so late again I'll try to get back on

3041.42 --> 3049.76
back on the track time wise I hope you

3047.089 --> 3051.47
like this video I I thought it was

3049.76 --> 3055.13
