124.92 --> 132.52
sucks

it's clouded big time and it's raining

132.959 --> 138.04
continually and the and there's wind and

135.56 --> 141.04
it's just

138.04 --> 141.04
g

143.64 --> 152.2
wow it's not super cold but it's just

147.0 --> 152.2
really GH terrible weather out

158.4 --> 163.48000000000002
[Music]

159.879 --> 166.0
there all right

163.48 --> 170.07999999999998
anyway hello mystical rock hound and

166.0 --> 170.08
fossils first in chat good to see

172.04 --> 177.67999999999998
you you're in

175.44 --> 181.159
early how are you

177.68 --> 187.84
doing let's check the way weather but

181.159 --> 187.84
first it is Saturday the 9th of December

190.44 --> 198.879
[Music]

192.879 --> 203.12
2023 temperature is 9Â° C right so not

198.879 --> 206.44
super cold but it's just dreary as all

203.12 --> 206.44
hell load

208.68 --> 211.68
dupons

214.239 --> 217.28
so yeah no show

220.36 --> 226.08
yesterday because I don't know yesterday

223.12 --> 226.08
had just terrible

226.4 --> 232.439
day was really

228.799 --> 236.36
yeah well I overslept but I had a rough

232.439 --> 238.68
night and yeah luckily I did get a call

236.36 --> 241.43900000000002
from my healer like in the

238.68 --> 244.72
afternoon

241.439 --> 247.72
because I tried to call him

244.72 --> 251.84
earlier and what I suspected was correct

247.72 --> 251.84
that I was somehow completely

253.519 --> 258.56
disconnected

255.079 --> 260.759
so because I had seen the signs of that

258.56 --> 262.479
it's like when you become completely

260.759 --> 267.47900000000004
disconnected

262.479 --> 267.479
unexpectedly and this can apparently

268.44 --> 273.68
like if it's weird sometimes it just

271.6 --> 276.08000000000004
comes flying out of nothing it's not

273.68 --> 280.24
because of anything anybody did it's

276.08 --> 282.8
just like a sudden rupture in the

280.24 --> 285.52
stability and this goes

282.8 --> 288.32
around cuz I wasn't the only

285.52 --> 291.35999999999996
one that noticed this issue but yeah

288.32 --> 293.71999999999997
it's like getting

291.36 --> 297.0
kicked getting smacked off your throne

293.72 --> 300.91900000000004
all of a sudden but when that happens

297.0 --> 304.52
when I do the technique at night like I

300.919 --> 304.52
I can't tell for

305.12 --> 310.919
sure like whether it's working or not

308.639 --> 313.32
like my readings become off it's really

310.919 --> 315.919
weird and like you really can't tell

313.32 --> 319.52
except for like really little

315.919 --> 322.71999999999997
signs like like

319.52 --> 325.96
sudden like stronger feelings of Doubt

322.72 --> 327.96000000000004
which normally absolutely don't happen

325.96 --> 331.479
especially during

327.96 --> 331.479
that so

331.72 --> 337.639
yeah I overslept enormously and I did

335.28 --> 339.23999999999995
not feel super great it would have been

337.639 --> 342.28000000000003
a super cranky

339.24 --> 344.56
show and I'm glad that basically I

342.28 --> 347.75899999999996
overslept for that because I'm

344.56 --> 350.639
done with putting that out

347.759 --> 353.68
there it's it's mostly just trolls

350.639 --> 356.919
feeding on it anyway and I'm done with

353.68 --> 359.12
it I want them all to starve to

356.919 --> 361.24
death I don't want to give them anything

359.12 --> 363.56
anymore

361.24 --> 363.56
like

368.479 --> 371.479
anything

372.16 --> 378.16
right but yeah I got basically restored

376.479 --> 380.639
really noticed the difference when I

378.16 --> 384.03900000000004
applied the technique at night it's

380.639 --> 386.96000000000004
like you ask certain questions and

384.039 --> 389.599
you're supposed to get answers

386.96 --> 392.44
well really the answers became very

389.599 --> 395.12
clear all of a sudden and so it's like

392.44 --> 398.199
whoa It's really really

395.12 --> 400.759
working and that's amazing I mean to me

398.199 --> 404.68
that's just

400.759 --> 407.88
wow one day you're doing it just lying

404.68 --> 409.68
in bed there and focusing and saying

407.88 --> 412.039
things out

409.68 --> 414.639
loud and you're like asking the

412.039 --> 418.039
questions and it's

414.639 --> 421.56
like like you feel something but it's

418.039 --> 424.84
all vague and like there's no there

421.56 --> 427.039
almost no connection it's weird freaky

424.84 --> 429.84
still plenty of energy around by the way

427.039 --> 433.87899999999996
it's not like oh my God I'm oh sucking

429.84 --> 436.87899999999996
me dry no never like that it's just it

433.879 --> 440.36
the connection is not really optimal

436.879 --> 443.59900000000005
then but then this

440.36 --> 446.96000000000004
night yeah it worked like amazing and

443.599 --> 451.319
like like almost actually Heard a

446.96 --> 451.31899999999996
Voice through it

452.08 --> 456.84
instead of like vague reading that's

454.479 --> 456.84
pretty

462.12 --> 467.319
incredible to me right to actually

464.72 --> 468.47900000000004
almost like get a voice response that's

467.319 --> 470.84000000000003
pretty

468.479 --> 472.87899999999996
astounding H right

470.84 --> 475.35999999999996
anyway it

472.879 --> 478.199
worked I do feel a lot better A lot

475.36 --> 481.319
restored I did also have very good

478.199 --> 481.319
dinner and all that

482.72 --> 485.12
hello

486.01 --> 489.12
[Music]

499.36 --> 503.56
Tommy not went to bed super

503.599 --> 512.64
late and so here I

506.599 --> 515.56
am uh right movie that I watched like uh

512.64 --> 515.56
did finish that

518.519 --> 523.44
up what is it

521.2 --> 526.36
Thursday but then I didn't get to talk

523.44 --> 530.0
about it yesterday it was an older

526.36 --> 531.399
movie Murphy's War like a war movie

530.0 --> 536.32
World War II

531.399 --> 536.32
based never seen that one before very

538.2 --> 542.6400000000001
interesting like that was a pretty good

546.959 --> 553.5189999999999
movie

549.6 --> 556.76
right like cuz it was also like just the

553.519 --> 559.839
war and then just like people basically

556.76 --> 562.16
getting caught in Revenge

559.839 --> 563.8800000000001
spirals which is what exactly what

562.16 --> 566.64
happened to the main character and it

563.88 --> 571.12
literally kills him in the end but you

566.64 --> 571.12
like see that coming miles away

572.12 --> 580.9590000000001
it's it was just a good movie it was

575.24 --> 580.9590000000001
interesting and like balanced I like

586.6 --> 591.399
that like I like it when a movie is like

589.519 --> 593.6
referencing things and it's like yeah

591.399 --> 596.079
this is so balanced like that could be

593.6 --> 598.12
real no matter what the perspect like no

596.079 --> 599.8389999999999
matter what you've

598.12 --> 601.6
learned

599.839 --> 604.0400000000001
like after everything I learned and like

601.6 --> 606.0790000000001
the whole thing like oh a lot of stuff

604.04 --> 608.959
was basically propaganda and like

606.079 --> 610.4799999999999
completely nonsense well this movie is

608.959 --> 614.2399999999999
like

610.48 --> 614.24
zans they're just

616.72 --> 621.8000000000001
soldiers and they're well they're kind

619.12 --> 624.76
of harsh and all that but they're

621.8 --> 629.279
basically like they're there's no

624.76 --> 632.079
spieling it up as I like to call it

629.279 --> 633.92
right and so yeah interesting very

632.079 --> 639.1999999999999
interesting movie

633.92 --> 642.959
older Murphy's War right

639.2 --> 642.9590000000001
anyway AO flip

646.92 --> 651.959
Flats geocentric creationist

658.04 --> 664.5999999999999
yeah

660.839 --> 667.7600000000001
okay you're making breakfast

664.6 --> 671.28
[Music]

667.76 --> 678.22
cool yeah good to see you

671.28 --> 678.22
[Music]

685.12 --> 690.48
again do you think reality shows are

688.519 --> 695.399
scripted

690.48 --> 695.399
no that's not thought I know they

697.32 --> 706.519
are like there's been

701.04 --> 706.519
documentaries on how they are absolutely

707.399 --> 712.92
scripted cuz you know why there's a

710.16 --> 716.88
logical reason for it too it's

712.92 --> 719.68
because the reality is just too freaking

716.88 --> 721.72
boring it's not sustainable

719.68 --> 723.8
you have an occasional interesting thing

721.72 --> 725.76
and then everything after that's boring

723.8 --> 727.519
that's how reality usually

725.76 --> 730.4399999999999
works and

727.519 --> 734.92
so reality shows

730.44 --> 737.1600000000001
like they just try to make it common and

734.92 --> 739.7199999999999
real looking but it's definitely

737.16 --> 743.0
scripted like there's a story like

739.72 --> 744.48
poured in there that just doesn't happen

743.0 --> 748.079
normally like

744.48 --> 749.76
that not under those circumstances like

748.079 --> 752.4799999999999
artificial

749.76 --> 757.16
[Music]

752.48 --> 757.16
friction it's nonsense entertainment

758.32 --> 768.32
really squid game no I didn't watch it

762.92 --> 768.3199999999999
this not a reality show duper

771.04 --> 779.68
dumbass it's science

774.639 --> 780.6800000000001
fiction I'm seriously duper are you like

779.68 --> 784.519
you're

780.68 --> 784.519
just are you playing

790.92 --> 797.56
them or is this is it another video or

794.199 --> 797.56
something that you're talking

798.839 --> 804.519
about challenge or when it's reality

802.48 --> 807.76
what the

804.519 --> 809.399
challenge reality

807.76 --> 811.3199999999999
TV

809.399 --> 814.32
well if it's like

811.32 --> 816.519
a it all depends like if it's like a

814.32 --> 820.5600000000001
contest that's one thing although that

816.519 --> 820.5600000000001
is like logically scripted

822.16 --> 827.4399999999999
too

824.92 --> 832.4799999999999
right but

827.44 --> 834.639
like the series on Netflix squid games

832.48 --> 836.6800000000001
that's ridiculous to call that a reality

834.639 --> 839.16
show so unless he's talking about

836.68 --> 841.079
something else that also called

839.16 --> 844.639
themselves squid games I have no idea

841.079 --> 844.6389999999999
what D is talking about

845.04 --> 851.36
then squid game The Challenge right no

848.759 --> 851.36
never heard of

863.88 --> 870.68
it do people die in

867.68 --> 870.68
it

871.959 --> 878.6389999999999
because that would make it

874.399 --> 878.639
illegal but uh yeah I

878.92 --> 882.399
mean sounds

885.8 --> 890.88
terrible squid game was terrible so

888.6 --> 893.9590000000001
anything that wants to associate with

890.88 --> 893.959
that is going to be

897.68 --> 900.68
terrible

905.24 --> 912.0790000000001
yeah hey ter 306 good see

907.92 --> 912.079
you sorry I didn't shout you out

916.04 --> 923.36
earlier they fake

918.44 --> 923.36
die oh so it's a squid game

925.32 --> 930.44
lar that's really

927.6 --> 933.48
silly I mean that's literally just

930.44 --> 933.48
children's games

933.56 --> 938.279
then why the [Â __Â ] would they call that

935.839 --> 942.0790000000001
squid game that's

938.279 --> 942.079
so that's so

943.04 --> 946.15
[Music]

950.279 --> 955.0
nasty only got viewers because we were

952.759 --> 958.36
lock down yeah and everybody was all

955.0 --> 961.16
we're all going to die so it was all it

958.36 --> 964.92
all made sense right

961.16 --> 964.92
Tommy everybody was just

967.44 --> 970.44
like

973.04 --> 978.079
yeah if Squid game is terrible then why

975.88 --> 981.12
was it so popular because people are

978.079 --> 983.7199999999999
[Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] D

981.12 --> 986.12
bro and they don't know what good what's

983.72 --> 986.12
good for

987.519 --> 990.519
them

993.53 --> 1004.36
[Music]

1001.639 --> 1008.16
right everybody's just getting fed all

1004.36 --> 1009.6800000000001
these Eugenics based ideas right is

1008.16 --> 1012.199
constant

1009.68 --> 1015.68
influx of like oh the world's so

1012.199 --> 1018.56
terrible like we have to we have to

1015.68 --> 1021.56
they're just invoking the freaking

1018.56 --> 1023.5999999999999
Evolution hor [Â __Â ] survival of the

1021.56 --> 1027.319
fittest they're

1023.6 --> 1030.16
continually pouring these ideas through

1027.319 --> 1033.72
media and then hype it all up and people

1030.16 --> 1037.0790000000002
buy it because they make things tough

1033.72 --> 1040.3600000000001
through Siege right Financial political

1037.079 --> 1041.4389999999999
Siege all that crap psychological Siege

1040.36 --> 1044.52
and then they tell you then they

1041.439 --> 1047.4
encourage you oh look see survive of the

1044.52 --> 1049.039
fittest if you just kill each

1047.4 --> 1051.72
other

1049.039 --> 1055.24
then you you get the

1051.72 --> 1059.32
trinkets huh huh that's literally what

1055.24 --> 1062.039
it is I find it absolutely

1059.32 --> 1067.3999999999999
repulsive I've never watched that [Â __Â ] I

1062.039 --> 1068.559
hate it I mean what is it again uh

1067.4 --> 1071.72
Hunger

1068.559 --> 1074.48
Games was kind of on the edge because at

1071.72 --> 1074.48
least it was

1076.039 --> 1081.8799999999999
like it was just against

1078.96 --> 1085.48
it there was a protagonist that was

1081.88 --> 1085.48
basically going through

1085.559 --> 1093.9189999999999
it but she really wanted to break free

1089.28 --> 1093.9189999999999
of it right where's that in the squid

1098.84 --> 1104.32
game I don't know I maybe there is

1101.96 --> 1106.32
something like that there I I I

1104.32 --> 1108.6399999999999
genuinely don't know because I actually

1106.32 --> 1111.2
didn't watch it and not just viral sake

1108.64 --> 1112.8400000000001
oh I didn't watch it because it's evil

1111.2 --> 1114.919
and then secretly watch it because I

1112.84 --> 1118.52
have to know about it no I actually

1114.919 --> 1121.159
didn't watch it I really didn't I don't

1118.52 --> 1124.2
want to every time it Go comes by on

1121.159 --> 1124.2
Netflix I'm like

1124.4 --> 1133.2
G I've seen I've seen like a trailer or

1128.0 --> 1135.76
something and that's like [Â __Â ] this

1133.2 --> 1137.28
series or movie or whatever the [Â __Â ] it

1135.76 --> 1140.6
was I don't even remember if it's a

1137.28 --> 1140.6
movie or a series I I don't

1140.72 --> 1147.52
care but Hunger Games is against the

1143.96 --> 1150.48
elites exactly and that's it's kind of

1147.52 --> 1152.32
the same thing but at least it's like

1150.48 --> 1154.3600000000001
Eugenics

1152.32 --> 1158.52
bad top

1154.36 --> 1162.8799999999999
down monarchical control or

1158.52 --> 1164.24
whatever Eugenics control bad and that's

1162.88 --> 1167.88
okay

1164.24 --> 1169.96
then squid Games took it too far and

1167.88 --> 1172.2
basically please like kind of suggested

1169.96 --> 1174.76
like no this is just this is society now

1172.2 --> 1177.3600000000001
this is like it's the new Gladiator hor

1174.76 --> 1179.2
[Â __Â ] it's Roman times all over again

1177.36 --> 1183.039
what they

1179.2 --> 1185.76
suggest yeah guess what and the Romans

1183.039 --> 1188.8799999999999
they they were not ashamed about doing

1185.76 --> 1191.4
that [Â __Â ] yeah about the slaughter and

1188.88 --> 1195.159
all that yeah and that's what this did

1191.4 --> 1198.8400000000001
too in a way and that's bad that's

1195.159 --> 1202.0390000000002
evil is one thing to make an interesting

1198.84 --> 1205.3999999999999
heroes's Journey movie fighting against

1202.039 --> 1208.32
Elites and and evil

1205.4 --> 1210.919
control but to then just to warn people

1208.32 --> 1213.48
about it right and to help people

1210.919 --> 1214.44
internally brace against it against that

1213.48 --> 1217.039
sort of

1214.44 --> 1220.3200000000002
thing and that's a has a function it's

1217.039 --> 1221.96
like somebody warning the flock right in

1220.32 --> 1223.9189999999999
olden days priests would have done that

1221.96 --> 1226.919
would have warned about dangers from the

1223.919 --> 1226.919
outside

1226.96 --> 1231.64
whatever and that that's a positive

1229.679 --> 1234.76
function in movies if that's how the

1231.64 --> 1236.72
movie is made but if it's just like

1234.76 --> 1241.64
oh

1236.72 --> 1244.84
Gladiators no hero like this is normal

1241.64 --> 1247.5590000000002
now this is the future this toian fut

1244.84 --> 1247.559
yeah that's like

1249.28 --> 1255.6399999999999
[Â __Â ] that's a terrible example to give

1252.2 --> 1257.44
a terrible Vision to show the people

1255.64 --> 1260.24
especially when they're under pressure

1257.44 --> 1264.0
that's it's manipulation it's it's

1260.24 --> 1266.24
literally a bad imprint and then putting

1264.0 --> 1267.88
people in the world in desperation

1266.24 --> 1270.52
through the freaking lockdowns and all

1267.88 --> 1272.72
that [Â __Â ] and all this fear porn about

1270.52 --> 1276.36
invisible

1272.72 --> 1276.3600000000001
dangers and all that

1276.679 --> 1282.48
[Â __Â ] not able to visit your dying

1279.52 --> 1286.559
grandma that kind of crazy

1282.48 --> 1290.039
[Â __Â ] right yeah and then shoving this

1286.559 --> 1290.039
kind of Roman

1290.799 --> 1295.8799999999999
style gladiator [Â __Â ] in your face yeah

1293.919 --> 1298.3200000000002
people are going to be like yeah yeah

1295.88 --> 1302.279
kill them kill

1298.32 --> 1305.52
them like

1302.279 --> 1308.0
slaves they get that imprint so they get

1305.52 --> 1311.279
A Bit of Sympathy for eugenics that's

1308.0 --> 1313.84
now a part of them in their moment of

1311.279 --> 1316.36
desperation and that will come back

1313.84 --> 1319.32
right so when they get pressured again

1316.36 --> 1324.36
the Eugenics will then re reemerge that

1319.32 --> 1324.36
mindset will reemerge that's called

1325.24 --> 1330.679
programming that's like a demonic

1327.64 --> 1333.0
programming put people in a in a period

1330.679 --> 1333.799
of desperation show them certain types

1333.0 --> 1337.72
of

1333.799 --> 1340.24
visions that frequency wise correspond

1337.72 --> 1343.039
with that their desperation and it will

1340.24 --> 1343.039
imprint

1344.919 --> 1350.2
itself and then start to resonate with

1348.48 --> 1353.88
those people and

1350.2 --> 1359.679
reemerge when that kind of

1353.88 --> 1359.679
frequency has arrived with them it's

1360.559 --> 1369.12
terrible yeah MK

1362.88 --> 1369.1200000000001
Ultra in a way but on a mass scale

1370.039 --> 1374.279
public hello Richard G good see

1374.4 --> 1378.6000000000001
you I'm going to eat this and I know

1377.279 --> 1381.6
this is very

1378.6 --> 1385.3999999999999
interesting but I am I need to take a

1381.6 --> 1385.3999999999999
bite out of this so

1406.88 --> 1409.88
cheers

1410.35 --> 1414.78
[Music]

1426.4 --> 1432.279
right and hey I deal with that frequency

1430.72 --> 1435.679
of desperation

1432.279 --> 1438.64
too in a way every time I really go rage

1435.679 --> 1442.96
win there is a a trace of desperation

1438.64 --> 1446.24
that's fueled that in order to

1442.96 --> 1446.24
grow like

1447.4 --> 1455.2
that desperation about the world about

1450.559 --> 1455.2
my own ability to do anything about

1457.6 --> 1466.1589999999999
it but at least when I go there through

1463.0 --> 1469.279
desperation arguably even though I don't

1466.159 --> 1471.44
really show it that much I mean it is

1469.279 --> 1474.12
effectively an ingredient of the fuel

1471.44 --> 1475.64
that makes me go rage win and I have to

1474.12 --> 1477.6
admit it

1475.64 --> 1483.6000000000001
because I

1477.6 --> 1483.6
am bound to Absolute unconditional

1484.6 --> 1490.559
honesty right I have to be honest about

1487.559 --> 1494.2
it the Alchemy of of

1490.559 --> 1496.96
me what happens and then hopefully the

1494.2 --> 1500.159
world will do the same right fix

1496.96 --> 1500.159
yourself and the world world will

1501.36 --> 1507.799
[Music]

1503.32 --> 1509.6789999999999
follow but what I try to do is instead

1507.799 --> 1511.799
of letting the

1509.679 --> 1514.76
desperation when it hits and the

1511.799 --> 1518.52
frequencies that

1514.76 --> 1521.76
come I basically allow my obsession to

1518.52 --> 1524.9189999999999
just destroy the

1521.76 --> 1528.6
evil to basically dominate in those

1524.919 --> 1533.72
moments to always go at the main

1528.6 --> 1537.1999999999998
Target so that desperation can never let

1533.72 --> 1539.32
there's no association with surrendering

1537.2 --> 1544.6000000000001
to the

1539.32 --> 1546.799
evil and be stared to deal with that

1544.6 --> 1549.1589999999999
stress of that

1546.799 --> 1552.039
decision that usually leads people to

1549.159 --> 1554.64
basically attack their own it's like you

1552.039 --> 1557.399
can't defeat the evil so you're then

1554.64 --> 1559.159
going to act it out on your neighbor or

1557.399 --> 1562.6789999999999
whatever

1559.159 --> 1565.88
ever right or on the on the target

1562.679 --> 1568.5590000000002
appointed to you by that

1565.88 --> 1570.48
evil and that's like a thing that almost

1568.559 --> 1573.44
happens like a reflex it's being

1570.48 --> 1577.0
conditioned and I am absolutely

1573.44 --> 1581.679
desperately trying to oppose that effect

1577.0 --> 1586.44
by doing exactly the opposite at all

1581.679 --> 1586.44
times at all times

1586.6 --> 1591.84
always

1589.48 --> 1593.08
because it's like the ultimate Marxist

1591.84 --> 1596.6399999999999
evil

1593.08 --> 1599.039
trick pressure people till they stress

1596.64 --> 1601.279
out and then basically tell them oh if

1599.039 --> 1602.84
you just do this and that like attack

1601.279 --> 1605.559
that your

1602.84 --> 1607.6
neighbor then we'll stop or we'll give

1605.559 --> 1610.52
you something right so you can live

1607.6 --> 1614.32
better like that's like the ultimate

1610.52 --> 1615.96
Evil and I want to condition the entire

1614.32 --> 1621.08
world to

1615.96 --> 1624.559
like rather choose to like go absolutely

1621.08 --> 1627.6789999999999
berserk and like make everybody else do

1624.559 --> 1631.44
that and like take it down rather than

1627.679 --> 1634.3200000000002
become a slave to the Empire and do

1631.44 --> 1634.3200000000002
damage to your

1641.279 --> 1646.559
own can't change

1643.88 --> 1650.0800000000002
yourself you have to that's [Â __Â ]

1646.559 --> 1650.08
dark mirror [Â __Â ]

1653.12 --> 1659.1999999999998
with you yourself is the only damn thing

1657.32 --> 1660.8799999999999
in the world you can

1659.2 --> 1664.88
change

1660.88 --> 1666.3600000000001
yeah not the things about you or to a

1664.88 --> 1670.159
limited

1666.36 --> 1673.1589999999999
degree but what you are and what you're

1670.159 --> 1675.919
going to do with it and how you view

1673.159 --> 1675.919
things and

1676.519 --> 1681.0
yourself

1678.24 --> 1684.2
and how you figure out how you can

1681.0 --> 1688.36
utilize your talents to

1684.2 --> 1688.3600000000001
reconfigure what you can

1691.36 --> 1697.6
do and then you become better and that

1695.32 --> 1699.96
way you fix the world because now

1697.6 --> 1704.8799999999999
there's an example of how it can be

1699.96 --> 1709.44
better and other people can use that as

1704.88 --> 1709.44
an inspiration to climb up to that

1712.36 --> 1715.0
and then it

1718.159 --> 1725.2
integrates oh you don't want to change

1720.24 --> 1725.2
yourself oh that's fine [Â __Â ]

1725.88 --> 1733.239
with be part of the [Â __Â ] problem then

1730.15 --> 1733.239
[Music]

1735.559 --> 1739.799
huh I know it's very hard to actually do

1738.6 --> 1742.799
something about

1739.799 --> 1742.799
yourself

1744.88 --> 1752.3200000000002
right it's the only way you're going to

1748.159 --> 1752.3200000000002
actually change the world for the better

1757.039 --> 1764.559
though it's that real big challenge yeah

1761.72 --> 1764.559
to overcome

1766.32 --> 1770.08
yourself your own

1770.84 --> 1774.8799999999999
ego nothing in the world is

1775.35 --> 1778.5
[Music]

1796.32 --> 1799.32
tougher

1818.919 --> 1823.919
no I didn't see that show ter i' never

1821.519 --> 1823.919
heard of

1826.24 --> 1829.24
it

1832.039 --> 1839.399
people feel

1834.679 --> 1841.88
inadequate yeah so how does that because

1839.399 --> 1844.2399999999998
they've been Indo yeah but you get

1841.88 --> 1847.1200000000001
indoctrinated if you are

1844.24 --> 1850.27
inadequate so what's the point there

1847.12 --> 1855.6899999999998
dark mirror

1850.27 --> 1855.69
[Music]

1856.24 --> 1859.24
huh

1864.78 --> 1867.869
[Music]

1875.56 --> 1881.1699999999998
[Music]

1884.88 --> 1890.44
they are trying to change a through no

1886.88 --> 1892.2
no they are changing you through

1890.44 --> 1895.24
indoctrination

1892.2 --> 1896.76
yeah just because there's parts of it

1895.24 --> 1901.559
that you can

1896.76 --> 1904.039
see doesn't mean you can escape it

1901.559 --> 1907.399
because there's a lot of parts you can't

1904.039 --> 1910.32
see you can see how everything has

1907.399 --> 1913.559
changed and will be changed because of

1910.32 --> 1916.1589999999999
how things are done you don't see that

1913.559 --> 1919.1589999999999
part you're living

1916.159 --> 1919.159
it

1920.919 --> 1926.1200000000001
yeah and

1923.12 --> 1928.7199999999998
hey if they're indoctrinating everybody

1926.12 --> 1932.12
to do certain things to be programmed

1928.72 --> 1934.88
well then counter

1932.12 --> 1939.1589999999999
indoctrinate undo the

1934.88 --> 1942.2
programming and even offer an

1939.159 --> 1946.0800000000002
alternative slide an alternative

1942.2 --> 1947.72
railroad right a counter system to fall

1946.08 --> 1950.48
back to

1947.72 --> 1952.519
instead of just oh don't engage don't

1950.48 --> 1955.84
because in this world you don't always

1952.519 --> 1955.84
have the luxury not to

1958.679 --> 1968.519
engage so an alternative

1963.12 --> 1968.5189999999998
response that is consistent would be

1969.159 --> 1972.72
great yeah sure you

1976.039 --> 1979.039
do

1982.12 --> 1986.639

though because if you if it you just

2724.24 --> 2730.2
really like this tell funny story

2726.64 --> 2734.52
stories that's okay but I mean you can't

2730.2 --> 2734.52
be seriously claiming that that actually

2734.72 --> 2738.64
happened car driver called

2740.359 --> 2745.96
him but did he get hit hard I mean he

2743.76 --> 2747.2400000000002

2866.0 --> 2869.2

2923.04 --> 2928.52
came in with duper and like asked him

2933.96 --> 2938.7200000000003
it's not that voice I'm pretty sure it's

2935.599 --> 2942.0
is not that speech

2938.72 --> 2943.9599999999996
impeded I hope for

2942.0 --> 2947.92
him but

2943.96 --> 2950.48
uh just like ask then bringing up Flat

2947.92 --> 2952.319

earthers and the guy's like what yeah

2956.28 --> 2960.96

2958.28 --> 2963.8390000000004
Earth I just follow

2960.96 --> 2967.52

3004.64 --> 3008.87
he might be a little bit like Mr Bean

3006.92 --> 3011.929
but I mean come

3008.87 --> 3011.929
[Music]

3019.2 --> 3024.4399999999996
on you always get crazy looks when you

3021.88 --> 3027.44
go against flat

3024.44 --> 3027.44
earthers

3028.04 --> 3032.96
what what do you mean akum virus are you

3030.839 --> 3036.44
saying

3032.96 --> 3041.48
that like where you live where you work

3036.44 --> 3041.48
or whatever that most people are flat

3050.44 --> 3057.44
earthers oh just mentioning oh okay I

3054.16 --> 3057.44
guess not

3058.76 --> 3064.92
aumu virus and

3060.52 --> 3066.119
anti well dupons you shouldn't ask him

3064.92 --> 3070.839
first

3066.119 --> 3074.04
off but technically yes but I mean I've

3070.839 --> 3074.04
just classified him as a

3077.119 --> 3085.52
Ballard I mean he's not like obsessive

3082.119 --> 3087.92
compulsive that he always like he he has

3085.52 --> 3091.839
to R try to ridicule flat earthers or

3087.92 --> 3096.599
something he's not like those

3091.839 --> 3100.04
people but I mean he's constructed wild

3096.599 --> 3103.2400000000002
Fantastical nonsensical ideas to try and

3100.04 --> 3104.799
justify why the Earth would be a globe

3103.24 --> 3107.16
and that technically makes him an

3104.799 --> 3109.799
anti-flat earther and not just a baller

3107.16 --> 3112.16
because Normal Ballers don't go outside

3109.799 --> 3115.48
of the official narrative and akumu

3112.16 --> 3117.44
virus has done that I mean it's very

3115.48 --> 3119.119
common right especially if you go

3117.44 --> 3122.88
against flat earthers that you're going

3119.119 --> 3124.28
to start fabricating your own fixes to

3122.88 --> 3126.2000000000003
try to

3124.28 --> 3127.7200000000003
bypass that

3126.2 --> 3131.16
horrid

3127.72 --> 3133.839
surrender to the fact that the Earth is

3131.16 --> 3135.5989999999997
flat so you're going to end up an anti

3133.839 --> 3138.16
flat earther I mean we've talked a lot

3135.599 --> 3138.1600000000003
about this on

3138.72 --> 3143.359
fed right once you figure it once you

3141.68 --> 3146.839
hear about Flat Earth you start rolling

3143.359 --> 3150.68
down that Hill and then the anti flat

3146.839 --> 3152.72
earther just tries to go back on the

3150.68 --> 3156.319
hill doesn't

3152.72 --> 3158.319
work you're with the flat earthers now

3156.319 --> 3159.7599999999998
because you figured it out now you're

3158.319 --> 3163.72
not accepting

3159.76 --> 3166.079
it but you are and so because of that

3163.72 --> 3167.319
you're going to start fabricating your

3166.079 --> 3170.0
own

3167.319 --> 3172.96
arguments to try to deny the Earth is

3170.0 --> 3175.48
flat but those arguments are outside of

3172.96 --> 3177.839
the official narrative because the

3175.48 --> 3180.88
official narrative only works to those

3177.839 --> 3183.88
that stay up that hill that don't come

3180.88 --> 3186.48
into contact with flat Earth that don't

3183.88 --> 3188.28
have that Curiosity and go for it

3186.48 --> 3191.4
because those people will all start

3188.28 --> 3193.52
rolling down the hill the propaganda the

3191.4 --> 3196.04
the official narrative only works to

3193.52 --> 3198.839
those that don't

3196.04 --> 3201.4
inquire to Flat

3198.839 --> 3204.44
Earth cuz when you do you start rolling

3201.4 --> 3206.28
down the hill you start to figure it out

3204.44 --> 3209.2000000000003
you become an anti Flat Earth you're

3206.28 --> 3212.119
going to venture outside of the official

3209.2 --> 3214.16
narrative and it's perfectly Justified I

3212.119 --> 3217.079
mean in my personal opinion and I'm an

3214.16 --> 3219.2
anti flat earther too as Ballwin because

3217.079 --> 3221.799
the official narrative is

3219.2 --> 3223.24
horeshit it doesn't work it's not

3221.799 --> 3226.24
properly

3223.24 --> 3229.7599999999998
constructed that's not a convincing way

3226.24 --> 3234.4399999999996
to to think of the Earth as a

3229.76 --> 3236.92
ball so yeah I'm totally with you guys

3234.44 --> 3238.799
in that sense

3236.92 --> 3241.359
right from a

3238.799 --> 3243.799
creative

3241.359 --> 3246.04
artist's

3243.799 --> 3248.24
perspective I mean I know the Earth is

3246.04 --> 3250.92
flat but I mean there's much more

3248.24 --> 3255.2
convincing ways you could think of the

3250.92 --> 3255.2000000000003
Earth as a ball than the official

3264.079 --> 3267.079
narrative

3267.839 --> 3272.7599999999998
you just want the Earth to get the globe

3269.68 --> 3275.44
CL you don't get the globe games right

3272.76 --> 3278.0
kakumu virus it's fine and I get it I

3275.44 --> 3281.96
have that too I want I hate it when

3278.0 --> 3284.2
numpty flat earthers just get it wrong

3281.96 --> 3286.64
or something it's so

3284.2 --> 3288.5989999999997
annoying right I mean you're going to be

3286.64 --> 3290.8799999999997
if you actually think oh you're going to

3288.599 --> 3293.88
become a flat earther but

3290.88 --> 3295.92
congratulations that means you have to

3293.88 --> 3298.96
become a globber

3295.92 --> 3301.44
why because you need to get it all right

3298.96 --> 3304.68
you need to get every freaking little

3301.44 --> 3306.2000000000003
stupid ass detail of the globe claims

3304.68 --> 3309.52
right and you need to get it right

3306.2 --> 3311.8799999999997
perfectly flawlessly and on a whim you

3309.52 --> 3314.119
need to be able to whip it out as a

3311.88 --> 3317.2000000000003
reflex when you're half asleep you know

3314.119 --> 3320.079
why cuz if you don't you're nothing but

3317.2 --> 3321.839
a numpty flat earther and every and and

3320.079 --> 3324.119
you'll be the laughing stock of all

3321.839 --> 3327.68
these globers that got all the things

3324.119 --> 3329.1600000000003
all perfectly memorized and at ready and

3327.68 --> 3332.0389999999998
cheat

3329.16 --> 3334.1189999999997
cheats with a chip in their brain

3332.039 --> 3336.6800000000003
eventually right I can imagine something

3334.119 --> 3340.48
like that I mean it's not even a joke

3336.68 --> 3343.48
seriously they'll go there but you got

3340.48 --> 3346.44
to get it perfectly right because it's

3343.48 --> 3349.44
all about did you get the puzzle right

3346.44 --> 3351.119
did you know the learning facts that's

3349.44 --> 3353.2000000000003
what the globe religion is it's all

3351.119 --> 3355.079
about do you get all the details right

3353.2 --> 3358.0789999999997
do you understand exactly how it works

3355.079 --> 3358.9100000000003
if you get it wrong you're the idiot

3358.079 --> 3360.52
flat

3358.91 --> 3363.5589999999997
[Music]

3360.52 --> 3366.96
earther so if you seriously dare to

3363.559 --> 3370.2400000000002
venture forth to become a flat earther

3366.96 --> 3374.039
coming out for it not just keeping it to

3370.24 --> 3376.839
yourself you have to master the globe

3374.039 --> 3379.079
you have to get it everything perfectly

3376.839 --> 3381.599
correct you have to pretty much Master

3379.079 --> 3383.3590000000004
everything hang around with people that

3381.599 --> 3385.799
are Masters in their

3383.359 --> 3389.0
fields have to master

3385.799 --> 3393.319
physics hopeful or mathematics if you

3389.0 --> 3395.64
can very helpful I mean I am very glad

3393.319 --> 3397.68
that I know guys that are very good at

3395.64 --> 3399.2
math with flat Earth and that I can

3397.68 --> 3401.68
literally ask them

3399.2 --> 3404.9199999999996
questions because I am not that good

3401.68 --> 3409.1189999999997
with it really I mean

3404.92 --> 3412.119
I'm quick I recognize patterns but I

3409.119 --> 3415.2000000000003
don't know complicated extended math

3412.119 --> 3417.96
[Â __Â ] drives me nuts gives me a headache

3415.2 --> 3419.8799999999997
it the same quality as me trying to read

3417.96 --> 3423.76
through an entire book in one go I mean

3419.88 --> 3427.2000000000003
there's no way like I start reading

3423.76 --> 3429.3590000000004
virtual pages that aren't in the book

3427.2 --> 3431.839
after a few pages if it's good it just

3429.359 --> 3436.799
happens just start reading Dark World

3431.839 --> 3439.24
Book like not the actual book so math

3436.799 --> 3443.799
kind of does that

3439.24 --> 3445.839
too like either gives me a headache or I

3443.799 --> 3449.44
just

3445.839 --> 3452.7599999999998
I just can't get a good grip on it

3449.44 --> 3455.16
right but it is very helpful if you're

3452.76 --> 3458.039
good at math if you want to be a flat

3455.16 --> 3461.799
earther because that helps

3458.039 --> 3465.28
you get the globe claims more

3461.799 --> 3468.359
precise and able to reut the technical

3465.28 --> 3471.4
failures that are going to present

3468.359 --> 3474.5989999999997
themselves from globers as they try to

3471.4 --> 3475.44
fight you off as a flat earther because

3474.599 --> 3478.4
well

3475.44 --> 3481.2400000000002
well if the glober

3478.4 --> 3482.52
were intelligent enough to get it all

3481.24 --> 3486.8799999999997
perfectly

3482.52 --> 3486.88
correct then they would be too

3487.079 --> 3493.52
smart to not realize that it doesn't

3490.839 --> 3496.0389999999998
work and it doesn't match so you're

3493.52 --> 3498.4
always ex like it's the like if you

3496.039 --> 3502.44
master as a flat earther the globe

3498.4 --> 3505.119
claims and all that you can continually

3502.44 --> 3508.64
correct Ballers and win over them that

3505.119 --> 3510.96
way and that way they'll always be like

3508.64 --> 3513.0389999999998
on the sidelines but they'll never

3510.96 --> 3515.92
actually get

3513.039 --> 3518.6800000000003
there because you're literally smarter

3515.92 --> 3521.119
than them right and you don't have that

3518.68 --> 3524.0789999999997
giant obstruction of globe belief of

3521.119 --> 3527.7200000000003
believing it has to be real

3524.079 --> 3530.1600000000003
anymore but you got to master the globe

3527.72 --> 3532.68
claims you have to you have to be a

3530.16 --> 3535.839
master of the [Â __Â ] that they roll

3532.68 --> 3538.72
out because they aren't master

3535.839 --> 3541.16
cuz the more you master it the more you

3538.72 --> 3544.0389999999998
start to see how it actually doesn't

3541.16 --> 3546.0789999999997
work how it can't work and how it even

3544.039 --> 3549.2000000000003
was like falsely constructed

3546.079 --> 3549.2000000000003
historically how that

3549.68 --> 3553.1189999999997
happened if you wisen up too much you

3551.96 --> 3555.599
see it's

3553.119 --> 3559.44
fake but yeah as a flat earther you

3555.599 --> 3563.6400000000003
don't have that issue you know it's

3559.44 --> 3565.2000000000003
fake but you still have to master

3563.64 --> 3568.16
it

3565.2 --> 3570.48
and that way it's like globers will

3568.16 --> 3572.24
always be like stupid flat earthers as

3570.48 --> 3574.52
soon as they talk at you they you

3572.24 --> 3578.319
immediately just crush them and they can

3574.52 --> 3581.92
do nothing but just drip away in

3578.319 --> 3584.799
shame and depending on their condition

3581.92 --> 3586.48
try to forget about it forget any all

3584.799 --> 3588.599
the things that were said so they can

3586.48 --> 3590.2400000000002
continue on their Globe belief or

3588.599 --> 3593.6400000000003
actually

3590.24 --> 3596.64
start on their Voyage of

3593.64 --> 3596.64
redemption

3599.359 --> 3605.64
anyway I'm going to turn my coffee up be

3603.359 --> 3605.64
right

3623.559 --> 3626.559
back

3648.799 --> 3651.24
and I'm

3651.599 --> 3659.7200000000003
back why do they get wrong about

3655.28 --> 3659.7200000000003
what why do they get wrong

3661.48 --> 3666.68
about oh my God no akumu

3667.2 --> 3673.0389999999998
virus don't do that for [Â __Â ] sake not

3681.599 --> 3690.3590000000004
again gel a

3685.2 --> 3693.64
effect is an apparent deflection a non

3690.359 --> 3697.0389999999998
actual deviation because an

3693.64 --> 3699.799
illusion that happens when a person that

3697.039 --> 3701.1600000000003
mistakes themselves for being still but

3699.799 --> 3705.079
are actually

3701.16 --> 3708.2799999999997
moving witnessing other things that are

3705.079 --> 3710.559
still a non-actual deflection because

3708.28 --> 3712.3190000000004
the Observer the thing that's deflecting

3710.559 --> 3715.0
pretty much that's corel's effect and

3712.319 --> 3717.319
that is exclusively corel's effect

3715.0 --> 3720.16
and the other horeshit

3717.319 --> 3722.2
claims about how that illusion of

3720.16 --> 3728.16
deflection supposedly causes actual

3722.2 --> 3728.16
motion is all pseudo science garbage

3728.44 --> 3733.359
globis and that's a fact that's a

3730.88 --> 3736.2000000000003
physics official

3733.359 --> 3740.4
fact and I'm not going to endure your

3736.2 --> 3744.1189999999997
nonsense in this Akuma virus not

3740.4 --> 3746.559
again I mean we got enough numpty clips

3744.119 --> 3750.119
of you [Â __Â ] it

3746.559 --> 3752.48
up yeah on Quantum eraser Channel I'm

3750.119 --> 3756.079
not going to go through it all again

3752.48 --> 3756.079
with you

3762.839 --> 3768.68
okay no duper don't don't do

3773.359 --> 3776.279
that

3775.24 --> 3779.72
truth

3776.279 --> 3779.72
Seeker with

3791.279 --> 3796.0
that welcome to the Flat Earth early bir

3798.59 --> 3801.76
[Music]

3803.279 --> 3806.279
show

3822.2 --> 3824.5989999999997
okay

3833.279 --> 3836.279
Doer

3838.44 --> 3842.4
what the [Â __Â ] Teran what are you talking

3853.279 --> 3856.92
about are you

3857.599 --> 3865.1600000000003
seriously okay so Teran is saying that

3861.599 --> 3871.039
balart should be living with their

3865.16 --> 3871.0389999999998
distant cousins also they think in the

3871.48 --> 3877.119
zoo okay that is just

3874.119 --> 3877.119
funny

3882.26 --> 3885.3390000000004
[Music]

3891.2 --> 3898.8799999999997
H and I by the way disagree because

3894.839 --> 3902.799
to have people in a zoo the maintenance

3898.88 --> 3902.799
for that is actually much more

3905.4 --> 3912.119
expensive I mean if you live in a zoo

3908.92 --> 3915.96
you literally have servants that clean

3912.119 --> 3918.839
up your [Â __Â ] and get you your

3915.96 --> 3920.92
food those animals in the zoo yeah

3918.839 --> 3923.599
despite them living in a cage and that's

3920.92 --> 3925.7200000000003
one thing right but I mean they are

3923.599 --> 3929.0
literally like living

3925.72 --> 3931.799
like middle class or

3929.0 --> 3935.24
nobility in the 19th century like they

3931.799 --> 3936.7599999999998
have a households they have dedicated

3935.24 --> 3939.9199999999996
Cooks dedicated

3936.76 --> 3943.039
cleaners like dude have you ever thought

3939.92 --> 3945.2000000000003
of it like that I mean let's not keep

3943.039 --> 3948.2000000000003
ballards in zoos that would be

3945.2 --> 3948.2
enormously

3953.079 --> 3956.8390000000004
expensive

3954.599 --> 3959.6400000000003
yeah and now I ruined the joke in

3956.839 --> 3959.64
typical Arwin

3963.79 --> 3966.84
[Music]

3968.94 --> 3972.209
[Music]

3975.599 --> 3980.88
fashion when to hear your other

3978.96 --> 3983.0
sorry okay

3980.88 --> 3986.0
duper

3983.0 --> 3986.0
whatever

3986.16 --> 3988.96
I'm going to get my

4013.0 --> 4016.0
coffee

4042.92 --> 4045.92
for

4071.68 --> 4075.9199999999996
and I got coffee

4076.44 --> 4080.839
still cold

4078.24 --> 4082.8799999999997
here it's still cold and the freaking

4080.839 --> 4086.0
heater right next to

4082.88 --> 4088.9700000000003
me damn

4086.0 --> 4095.48
it okay

4088.97 --> 4099.4
[Music]

4095.48 --> 4099.4
Miss photos from

4102.679 --> 4107.52
space what wow

4104.679 --> 4110.159
duper yeah that is I mean that is

4107.52 --> 4110.159000000001
circular

4117.08 --> 4123.159
logic you do know that right

4120.0 --> 4125.229
duper you do recognize I I really hope

4123.159 --> 4128.339
you

4125.229 --> 4128.339
[Music]

4132.799 --> 4135.799
do

4136.46 --> 4143.08
[Music]

4138.759 --> 4143.08
it can't really be called logic yeah no

4159.279 --> 4167.400000000001
[Â __Â ] okay duper how old were you when

4163.279 --> 4171.759
that happened happened I want to

4167.4 --> 4171.759
know that's not an adult

4173.4 --> 4180.239
conversation what the hell duper how old

4176.759 --> 4180.239
were you when you had that

4181.18 --> 4184.27
[Music]

4189.62 --> 4195.719
[Music]

4192.719 --> 4195.719
conversation

4197.719 --> 4205.64
and I mean if if you were adult what

4201.6 --> 4205.64
it's just really silly man I

4205.96 --> 4212.679
mean I remember that kind of

4208.36 --> 4216.799999999999
conversation from like when I was

4212.679 --> 4220.52
10 19

4216.8 --> 4222.4800000000005
okay so I guess I mean duper you must

4220.52 --> 4225.64
have just then at that point just been

4222.48 --> 4225.639999999999
messing with him right

4226.56 --> 4233.120000000001
you spotted the circular logic and you

4229.48 --> 4233.12
try to make him see

4233.159 --> 4237.32
it I mean that's kind of funny

4252.64 --> 4255.64
then

4256.28 --> 4260.639999999999
yeah seeking starw water the distance

4257.92 --> 4262.56
through the sun did used to be a million

4260.64 --> 4266.4400000000005
miles and then just became more and more

4262.56 --> 4266.4400000000005
and more because the math stretched

4266.52 --> 4272.0
up right nothing actually changed it's

4269.88 --> 4274.8
just like the

4272.0 --> 4276.84
estimation of how distant they thought

4274.8 --> 4280.4400000000005
it was versus how big they thought it

4276.84 --> 4280.4400000000005
was was just the thing that they

4282.56 --> 4285.56
changed

4305.639 --> 4310.1990000000005
what right anyway I hope you're all

4307.679 --> 4310.1990000000005
enjoying the

4312.56 --> 4315.56
show

4325.96 --> 4328.639
what the [Â __Â ]

4335.84 --> 4342.12
did who are you talking to auma

4339.159 --> 4346.44
virus who said the distance to the Sun

4342.12 --> 4346.44
never changed who said

4354.159 --> 4359.08
that kumu says the math changed

4361.0 --> 4364.0
but

4366.8 --> 4371.719
the no aumu that makes no

4372.44 --> 4375.44
sense

4376.84 --> 4379.52
love of

4381.199 --> 4389.919999999999
what yeah Newton's law isn't law isn't

4386.12 --> 4393.28
physics it's a law within his mechanical

4389.92 --> 4397.1990000000005
idea within his system it's not actually

4393.28 --> 4399.219999999999
a law it's just the law the rules when

4397.199 --> 4402.3189999999995
you use Newtonian

4399.22 --> 4402.319
[Music]

4402.36 --> 4406.839999999999
reasoning

4404.36 --> 4409.4
so it's only a law within his system

4406.84 --> 4413.400000000001
it's like the law of the video game

4409.4 --> 4416.36
you're playing not a universal law it

4413.4 --> 4416.36
never was

4416.44 --> 4424.08
Universal yeah he never even claimed a

4420.08 --> 4428.199
hypothesis for gravitation officially on

4424.08 --> 4428.199
paper wrote a letter and

4432.36 --> 4435.36
everything

4436.44 --> 4438.96
yeah and by the way there is no theory

4438.239 --> 4442.08
of

4438.96 --> 4443.52
gravity because a theory requires a

4442.08 --> 4446.12
valid

4443.52 --> 4448.120000000001
hypothesis and gravity doesn't have a

4446.12 --> 4450.32
valid hypothesis because there's no

4448.12 --> 4453.76
independent variable that can be very

4450.32 --> 4453.759999999999
manipulated in order to

4454.159 --> 4458.638999999999
prove the effect being

4461.4 --> 4467.12
caused so

4464.0 --> 4468.0
it's not a theory there is no experiment

4467.12 --> 4471.92
for

4468.0 --> 4475.88
Gravity there's no valid

4471.92 --> 4477.719
hypothesis and Einstein's gravity which

4475.88 --> 4481.32
is really the only thing that sort of

4477.719 --> 4483.4800000000005
was remaining after all the all the

4481.32 --> 4487.199
physical claims about gravity had been

4483.48 --> 4490.32
discarded in the early 40s if I'm not

4487.199 --> 4492.919999999999
mistaken yeah and then Einstein

4490.32 --> 4493.799999999999
supposedly worked with gravity but that

4492.92 --> 4498.08
gravity

4493.8 --> 4502.159000000001
did not apply to reality it only was

4498.08 --> 4505.8
mathematical an idea within a fictional

4502.159 --> 4509.719
medium that was mathematically

4505.8 --> 4515.04
conjured it never applied to

4509.719 --> 4518.719
reality there's no claim of something

4515.04 --> 4522.199
physical happening because of Einstein

4518.719 --> 4525.199
gravity you understand

4522.199 --> 4525.199
that

4528.08 --> 4533.0
[Music]

4530.08 --> 4535.4
gravity doesn't exist nobody knows what

4533.0 --> 4539.88
it is because it doesn't

4535.4 --> 4541.92
exist it's a vague idea a rumor that has

4539.88 --> 4546.52
been persistently

4541.92 --> 4549.36
placed for probably a 100 Generations or

4546.52 --> 4552.1990000000005
so proba maybe less but it's been

4549.36 --> 4556.799999999999
specifically planted as a colloquial

4552.199 --> 4559.839999999999
belief Grassroots without any actual tie

4556.8 --> 4561.639
in so that everybody has an idea there's

4559.84 --> 4563.96
gravity they have their own version in

4561.639 --> 4566.04
their mind of what it's supposed to be

4563.96 --> 4569.36
like a

4566.04 --> 4573.56
folklore but none of it relates to

4569.36 --> 4573.5599999999995
anything scientific

4573.88 --> 4579.4400000000005
physics nothing that is

4576.48 --> 4583.5599999999995
provable but it's been planted as a

4579.44 --> 4587.239
folklore starting at school very young

4583.56 --> 4589.280000000001
at school you learn the basics well they

4587.239 --> 4590.879999999999
teach you about gravity things go down

4589.28 --> 4593.239
go boom boom and then they don't tell

4590.88 --> 4594.92
you about gas

4593.239 --> 4597.5599999999995
behavior

4594.92 --> 4600.719
right and then they make the other

4597.56 --> 4603.4800000000005
nonsense blank assertions of outer space

4600.719 --> 4605.8
and how that's supposed to be all there

4603.48 --> 4608.04
and you yeah and then if you get pulled

4605.8 --> 4610.8
into that as a kid then yeah you just

4608.04 --> 4612.8
learn how the fictional universe is the

4610.8 --> 4614.84
globe and all and you just learn how

4612.8 --> 4616.400000000001
that is is you don't get proof for any

4614.84 --> 4619.88
of

4616.4 --> 4623.28
it yeah as soon as you try to start to

4619.88 --> 4626.84
like actually figure out whether the the

4623.28 --> 4628.96
Earth right here everything that is here

4626.84 --> 4632.679
right in front of you if it actually

4628.96 --> 4635.52
works like that you'll be sorely

4632.679 --> 4641.12
disappointed and figuring out that it

4635.52 --> 4641.120000000001
doesn't work like the globe cosmology at

4642.0 --> 4647.199
all

4644.44 --> 4649.879999999999
there's no gas outer space there's no

4647.199 --> 4653.599999999999
there's no outer space gas would would

4649.88 --> 4657.400000000001
not be sticking here it

4653.6 --> 4661.4800000000005
can't there's nothing in the globe model

4657.4 --> 4664.04
idea in in the mechanics there that

4661.48 --> 4665.839999999999
actually justifies how the gas is

4664.04 --> 4668.92
supposed to be sticking to the ball

4665.84 --> 4671.2390000000005
nothing there unless you just don't

4668.92 --> 4673.6
think of gas as gas and you just think

4671.239 --> 4675.718999999999
of it as a liquid

4673.6 --> 4679.639
and and use Newtonian mechanics and

4675.719 --> 4684.159
that's the only way they've had any kind

4679.639 --> 4688.400000000001
of like seiling conclusion it's so so

4684.159 --> 4688.4
remote from physical reality it's

4688.639 --> 4694.32
absurd it's like it's embarrassing like

4692.239 --> 4697.199
it's embarrassing to bwin I'm

4694.32 --> 4699.5199999999995
embarrassed about that that's why bwin

4697.199 --> 4701.04
has completely different approaches to

4699.52 --> 4703.2390000000005
all that

4701.04 --> 4706.04
horeshit and I'm going to play with

4703.239 --> 4710.32
SpaceTime bending which is up for grabs

4706.04 --> 4713.5199999999995
I mean hello there's an entire fictional

4710.32 --> 4716.4
Universe out there of SpaceTime bending

4713.52 --> 4719.080000000001
that you can use to justify all kinds of

4716.4 --> 4723.44
things right it's up for grabs it's like

4719.08 --> 4725.76
a a new paint and nobody's using that

4723.44 --> 4729.239
paint on those canvases because it's

4725.76 --> 4731.4400000000005
like we don't understand it when well

4729.239 --> 4734.08
you don't have to you just use it to

4731.44 --> 4737.839999999999
make more [Â __Â ] EXC exuses as to why

4734.08 --> 4742.88
things seem the way they

4737.84 --> 4746.56
are in your belief to be Globe

4742.88 --> 4749.76
Universe it's very easy I've worked on

4746.56 --> 4752.6
it I already got a model that explains

4749.76 --> 4754.679
how the gas sticks to the ball versus a

4752.6 --> 4758.4400000000005
vacuum without a physical

4754.679 --> 4764.6
barrier I already have explanations for

4758.44 --> 4766.12
this that are much more Rel viable and

4764.6 --> 4769.320000000001
less

4766.12 --> 4771.92
cooky than the nonsense Solutions of

4769.32 --> 4774.92
treating gas like liquids and go down go

4771.92 --> 4779.4800000000005
boom boom because that's just horeshit

4774.92 --> 4779.4800000000005
nothing works like that ever under any

4783.4 --> 4789.48
circumstance right but considering what

4786.719 --> 4793.4
is already believed about black holes

4789.48 --> 4796.5199999999995
this crazy super gravity fictional

4793.4 --> 4799.599999999999
nonsense if people can believe in that

4796.52 --> 4803.719
then they can very much believe that

4799.6 --> 4805.96
there is some kind of gravitational

4803.719 --> 4808.36
SpaceTime bending

4805.96 --> 4813.32
effect that could

4808.36 --> 4813.32
deter the gas from

4813.8 --> 4820.76
expanding so that effectively SP that

4817.719 --> 4823.4
yeah it would be falling right so the

4820.76 --> 4825.400000000001
gas would be attempting to expand

4823.4 --> 4829.08
but at the same

4825.4 --> 4830.839999999999
time it's also falling through the

4829.08 --> 4833.719
SpaceTime bending it's

4830.84 --> 4835.639
like a barrier that is in the barrier is

4833.719 --> 4839.36
like a slide and everything that tries

4835.639 --> 4839.36
to go out just slides

4839.6 --> 4844.08
back because it's

4841.8 --> 4847.8
falling even though it's trying to

4844.08 --> 4847.8
escape it's still falling

4848.6 --> 4858.1990000000005
so it bends back harder than the gas can

4852.719 --> 4858.199
can expand into the void

4859.8 --> 4865.84
Beyond there you go now all the gas laws

4863.76 --> 4869.679
can all be in place and everything can

4865.84 --> 4869.679
work exactly as it actually

4870.56 --> 4876.84
does and you can just trust that yeah

4874.36 --> 4879.159
there's just a gravity well in which the

4876.84 --> 4879.159000000001
Earth

4879.88 --> 4887.400000000001
sits that yeah

4883.88 --> 4888.679
the gases just are not going to expand

4887.4 --> 4892.92
any

4888.679 --> 4895.159
further CU they will be unable to escape

4892.92 --> 4896.92
as they try to expand it's like they

4895.159 --> 4900.0
find themselves to

4896.92 --> 4903.76
be slipping

4900.0 --> 4903.76
back right I

4903.92 --> 4911.639
mean so it's not getting pulled back

4908.239 --> 4914.638999999999
from some Force it's sliding

4911.639 --> 4914.639
back

4915.8 --> 4919.639
you don't agree who gives a [Â __Â ] would

4917.639 --> 4922.76
you agree with Akuma

4919.639 --> 4924.2390000000005
virus you still think Corola effect

4922.76 --> 4927.320000000001
causes

4924.239 --> 4929.599999999999
emotion who the [Â __Â ] give [Â __Â ] about

4927.32 --> 4932.639
what you think about how the globe

4929.6 --> 4932.639
cosmology is

4938.8 --> 4944.56
dumbass sorted it the [Â __Â ]

4947.44 --> 4953.5199999999995
no can be called a theory yeah well not

4950.199 --> 4955.678999999999
a scientific theory duper colloquial

4953.52 --> 4959.1990000000005
nonsense Theory yeah that's what I

4955.679 --> 4963.4800000000005
that's what I already said

4959.199 --> 4967.36
yeah that's a theory as in an

4963.48 --> 4972.919999999999
idea that version that use of the word

4967.36 --> 4978.759999999999
theory as in an idea yeah gravity is an

4972.92 --> 4979.88
idea it's not a scientific theory though

4978.76 --> 4983.88
which

4979.88 --> 4983.88
is supposedly the

4984.679 --> 4993.0
claim that's what I was specifying duper

4988.679 --> 4995.52
yeah I know that the word theory can be

4993.0 --> 4995.52
used

4996.04 --> 5003.0
colloquially as an alternative for an

5001.48 --> 5004.879999999999
idea

5003.0 --> 5007.0
but that's not what I was talking about

5004.88 --> 5010.36
I was specifically talking about the

5007.0 --> 5014.04
scientific context right the context in

5010.36 --> 5014.04
which it is claimed to have

5014.88 --> 5023.8
authority not that it can be named a

5018.719 --> 5023.8
theory with the colloquial use of

5029.56 --> 5034.4800000000005
language that's fine duper that's fine

5036.58 --> 5041.22
[Music]

5046.88 --> 5054.28
spectroscopy yeah well

5049.199 --> 5057.36
spectroscopy only works in a

5054.28 --> 5063.239
vacuum you get

5057.36 --> 5066.199
it when you do Stellar Spectras if

5063.239 --> 5070.0
P you're

5066.199 --> 5073.599999999999
looking at a light in the

5070.0 --> 5075.639
sky light in the sky guess what there's

5073.6 --> 5078.639
a lot of

5075.639 --> 5078.639
nonvacuum

5078.719 --> 5084.52
between the thing that's doing the

5081.119 --> 5087.08
reading and the light in the sky so

5084.52 --> 5090.119000000001
that's completely

5087.08 --> 5093.119
disfunctional and not actually

5090.119 --> 5096.119
spectroscopy or anything like it it's

5093.119 --> 5098.32
just called spectroscopy because it's

5096.119 --> 5101.719
pretending to be

5098.32 --> 5104.159
spectroscopy even though it has

5101.719 --> 5108.639
absolutely nothing to do with

5104.159 --> 5111.638999999999
spectroscopy and has zero accuracy

5108.639 --> 5111.639
rating

5114.84 --> 5121.56
zero cuz you

5117.44 --> 5124.5599999999995
can't you can't figure out what material

5121.56 --> 5127.56
is based of a bunch of colors in the

5124.56 --> 5127.56
distance

5128.92 --> 5134.76
huh yeah yeah you can do it on Earth you

5132.199 --> 5137.839999999999
can definitely do spectroscopy on Earth

5134.76 --> 5141.6
you know what that requires a

5137.84 --> 5144.2390000000005
vacuum a little vacuum chamber in which

5141.6 --> 5147.719
you shine light

5144.239 --> 5152.0
yeah when when you don't do it in a

5147.719 --> 5156.0
vacuum chamber guess what all this stuff

5152.0 --> 5161.28
is all in between and so you get

5156.0 --> 5161.28
zero accuracy rating dumb

5178.6 --> 5184.1990000000005
[Music]

5181.199 --> 5184.199
[Â __Â ]

5187.44 --> 5193.919999999999
stop trying to double down on your Bal

5190.719 --> 5196.6
tarded beliefs Akuma virus you can't win

5193.92 --> 5198.8
you won't win you'll just end up getting

5196.6 --> 5200.84
kicked out of my [Â __Â ] hang out again

5198.8 --> 5204.08
is that what you

5200.84 --> 5206.4400000000005
want you just want to push it

5204.08 --> 5208.76
there you want to double down until

5206.44 --> 5211.199
you're like kicked out again is that

5208.76 --> 5215.159000000001
what you want

5211.199 --> 5215.159
akumu don't don't do

5216.119 --> 5227.44
that just PayPal me and shut the [Â __Â ]

5221.8 --> 5227.4400000000005
up and your ball [Â __Â ] can be

5238.4 --> 5243.679
forgiven yeah chck ch ch ch chck chck

5241.36 --> 5247.32
yeah whatever

5243.679 --> 5248.96
yeah yeah Stellar spectroscopy has zero

5247.32 --> 5250.48
accuracy

5248.96 --> 5255.8
rating

5250.48 --> 5260.159
yeah I mean Stellar spectoscopy is

5255.8 --> 5266.159000000001
probably accuracy rating wise lower on

5260.159 --> 5269.08
the scale as the p-wave swave

5266.159 --> 5271.119
prediction of what they found every time

5269.08 --> 5274.159
they dug a bit further in the Deep Cola

5271.119 --> 5277.759999999999
borle okay it's on that level of

5274.159 --> 5281.96
accuracy as in absolutely

5277.76 --> 5286.0
inaccurate totally wrong every freaking

5281.96 --> 5288.8
time because you can't do

5286.0 --> 5295.44
spectroscopy at a

5288.8 --> 5299.320000000001
distance you can only do it in a vacuum

5295.44 --> 5303.08
chamber because then there is no other

5299.32 --> 5305.799999999999
material but the material you're trying

5303.08 --> 5309.6
to analyze using light because as soon

5305.8 --> 5312.96
as there's any other material including

5309.6 --> 5315.04
gas it doesn't work anymore and that's

5312.96 --> 5317.92
why there is

5315.04 --> 5321.92
0% accuracy rating on Stellar

5317.92 --> 5321.92
spectoscopy get

5326.94 --> 5333.629999999999
[Music]

5329.639 --> 5340.08
it yeah diver D you you know how that

5333.63 --> 5341.84
[Music]

5340.08 --> 5344.84
works

5341.84 --> 5344.84
spectrometry

5344.92 --> 5350.4800000000005
spectrometry Co

5347.76 --> 5352.679
chromatograph

5350.48 --> 5356.44
what okay I

5352.679 --> 5358.2390000000005
guess since I technically don't even

5356.44 --> 5360.919999999999
really know what the difference between

5358.239 --> 5364.36
those things are then yes I am

5360.92 --> 5364.36
conflating I

5373.239 --> 5379.199
guess but are you saying that are you

5376.28 --> 5381.5599999999995
saying that they can literally use light

5379.199 --> 5383.4
like a laser or something to determine

5381.56 --> 5386.76
the

5383.4 --> 5386.759999999999
material at a

5390.92 --> 5393.92
distance

5396.239 --> 5402.919999999999
I I'm just asking because holy [Â __Â ] that

5399.639 --> 5407.1990000000005
would that freaking changed the

5402.92 --> 5409.8
game that's crazy if that's

5407.199 --> 5412.599999999999
possible I mean I can't imagine that at

5409.8 --> 5414.84
some point it would be possible I mean

5412.6 --> 5416.08
dude you can figure out materials just

5414.84 --> 5418.56
through

5416.08 --> 5421.96
frequency so if you literally start

5418.56 --> 5424.280000000001
combining lasers and like frequency and

5421.96 --> 5426.92
analysis and then like then it is like

5424.28 --> 5430.36
Star Trek [Â __Â ] just like oh what's that

5426.92 --> 5433.56
material composed of oh it's this per

5430.36 --> 5435.36
that that that that that okay yeah maybe

5433.56 --> 5438.280000000001
that's possible I don't

5435.36 --> 5440.599999999999
know as far as I know that the typical

5438.28 --> 5444.5599999999995
spectroscopy like that

5440.6 --> 5446.8
is analyzing specific materials requires

5444.56 --> 5449.88
an absolute vacuum and by the way the

5446.8 --> 5453.2390000000005
material is also destroyed in the

5449.88 --> 5456.08
process it's evaporated

5453.239 --> 5457.678999999999
and that's required for spectoscopy the

5456.08 --> 5458.8
actual process and the Stellar

5457.679 --> 5461.52
spectoscopy

5458.8 --> 5463.360000000001
is basically just a theft of the name

5461.52 --> 5466.8
because it doesn't do anything like it's

5463.36 --> 5470.08
just look at a bunch of colors and

5466.8 --> 5472.6
then correlate the colors with the

5470.08 --> 5475.679
material and that's what that is it's a

5472.6 --> 5475.679
total nonsense

5477.6 --> 5482.76
process that's right duper gas will

5480.0 --> 5486.239
always fill an available space and we'll

5482.76 --> 5489.679
keep doing so even in a dynamic system

5486.239 --> 5493.0
which is what we live in right so every

5489.679 --> 5496.84
time some baller might say but why do we

5493.0 --> 5499.48
have a gas gradient it's very

5496.84 --> 5502.119000000001
simple there's a temperature influence

5499.48 --> 5505.08
there's a cold on top and there's a heat

5502.119 --> 5506.96
down and it and it goes up and down both

5505.08 --> 5509.76
of it or at least the heat goes up and

5506.96 --> 5512.4800000000005
down day and

5509.76 --> 5514.4800000000005
night but there's a con Conant push

5512.48 --> 5518.718999999999
because of the

5514.48 --> 5520.0
heat to go upward well up there is cold

5518.719 --> 5524.52
is a

5520.0 --> 5527.6
constant evacuation it's like getting

5524.52 --> 5530.679
Slimmer it's retracting because it's

5527.6 --> 5534.639
cold and because of both movements the

5530.679 --> 5536.56
heat expanding down and the cold

5534.639 --> 5540.679
retracting up

5536.56 --> 5542.76
there that keeps moving both of it up

5540.679 --> 5544.2390000000005
there

5542.76 --> 5549.92
down

5544.239 --> 5549.919999999999
here right so up there it it

5550.04 --> 5558.96
sucks it like yeah how do you say that

5552.96 --> 5561.88
it gets pulled thinner down here it

5558.96 --> 5565.4800000000005
pushes it's not pulled it pushes the

5561.88 --> 5569.2390000000005
heat literally pushes right and that

5565.48 --> 5573.199
causes the effective higher pressure

5569.239 --> 5576.5599999999995
where that heat is and and up there a

5573.199 --> 5579.599999999999
lower pressure where that cold is and

5576.56 --> 5580.96
and it's like it's not still it's not

5579.6 --> 5584.2390000000005
stable you

5580.96 --> 5585.92
see the coal is continually pulling the

5584.239 --> 5588.32
air

5585.92 --> 5591.28
apart making it more

5588.32 --> 5593.199
dense more vacuous while the heat is

5591.28 --> 5597.4
continually doing the opposite and so

5593.199 --> 5600.28
this is a moving dynamic system but it

5597.4 --> 5601.96
results in that pressure gradient

5600.28 --> 5605.4
balance although it's not a per Perfect

5601.96 --> 5607.0
Balance it's just an average of the

5605.4 --> 5611.28
dynamic

5607.0 --> 5612.48
system right well none of these Dynamics

5611.28 --> 5617.84
could even

5612.48 --> 5617.839999999999
happen if the entire hole wasn't

5619.199 --> 5624.119
contained because any gas Dynamics can

5622.56 --> 5627.8
only

5624.119 --> 5631.199
happen after the gas has expanded to

5627.8 --> 5634.08
meet the available volume and then have

5631.199 --> 5637.719
in influences like temperature influence

5634.08 --> 5641.5199999999995
start to influence the now pressurized

5637.719 --> 5644.76
gas so that it can start to divide

5641.52 --> 5648.4800000000005
itself in a gradient based on the

5644.76 --> 5648.4800000000005
external influences like

5656.63 --> 5662.28
[Music]

5660.48 --> 5665.36
temperature

5662.28 --> 5668.199
not the spectroscopy used for

5665.36 --> 5672.119
astronomy yeah because that's a complete

5668.199 --> 5674.799999999999
horeshit thing that they do di for that

5672.119 --> 5677.719
you do realize right that the

5674.8 --> 5678.6
spectroscopy from astronomy is complete

5677.719 --> 5682.8
hor

5678.6 --> 5682.8
[Â __Â ] they literally don't do

5684.6 --> 5689.0
anything it's

5686.639 --> 5691.76
divining a

5689.0 --> 5694.6
light and then guessing the material

5691.76 --> 5699.280000000001
composition that's what it

5694.6 --> 5702.2390000000005
is literally diving

5699.28 --> 5706.92
light no no confirmation no proof

5702.239 --> 5711.04
whatsoever no confirmation that hit one

5706.92 --> 5714.719
single reading of Stellar spectroscopy

5711.04 --> 5717.6
has actually been correct not one single

5714.719 --> 5717.6
confirmation

5720.4 --> 5723.4
ever

5723.8 --> 5730.56
right I mean did they test the same

5727.719 --> 5733.08
thing on stuff down here did they right

5730.56 --> 5735.0
spell Stellar spectroscopy okay let's

5733.08 --> 5736.679
aim that light from that star and now

5735.0 --> 5740.08
let's aim it at that

5736.679 --> 5743.84
wall are you going to from the info

5740.08 --> 5747.08
get the material of the wall

5743.84 --> 5749.639
right if you were honest not not being

5747.08 --> 5751.8
told that's a wall that's a reading are

5749.639 --> 5755.159000000001
you going to come to the conclusion of

5751.8 --> 5755.159000000001
the actual material it's made

5755.8 --> 5760.0
of I highly doubt

5760.239 --> 5767.799999999999
it because that's what it's never used

5762.88 --> 5770.8
for it's only ever used to right to

5767.8 --> 5772.56
Divine the material nature of the lights

5770.8 --> 5775.4800000000005
in the sky that's the only thing it's

5772.56 --> 5777.0
ever used for they don't need no

5775.48 --> 5779.119
stinking

5777.0 --> 5781.4
confirmation they got some stinking

5779.119 --> 5783.639
confirmation then they can't make up the

5781.4 --> 5786.759999999999
[Â __Â ] anymore the way that's convenient

5783.639 --> 5790.159000000001
to them right they're pinned down and

5786.76 --> 5795.159000000001
they can't just change it around anymore

5790.159 --> 5799.96
they don't want that right I mean if you

5795.159 --> 5803.5199999999995
have authority over a Mystic

5799.96 --> 5805.8
domain you want the least amount of

5803.52 --> 5808.1990000000005
rules about the Mystic domain that's

5805.8 --> 5811.76
going to pin you

5808.199 --> 5814.799999999999
down in your creative resolve you want

5811.76 --> 5818.56
to keep it as open doored as possible

5814.8 --> 5818.56
all the options and no

5819.48 --> 5827.759999999999
rules otherwise you're just going to be

5822.92 --> 5827.76
trapped by your own rules that you set

5830.84 --> 5838.08
continually right and of course with

5833.8 --> 5839.639
Mystic domain I obviously mean the outer

5838.08 --> 5842.719
space

5839.639 --> 5846.1990000000005
galaxy that's the myc domain it's a

5842.719 --> 5849.08
conjured idea that is collectively

5846.199 --> 5851.5199999999995
reinforced until people actually believe

5849.08 --> 5853.88
it even though they never really get to

5851.52 --> 5853.88
see

5854.199 --> 5858.48
it personally they just get to see a lot

5857.639 --> 5862.4400000000005
of

5858.48 --> 5866.0
Art and they get told stories on how to

5862.44 --> 5868.96
regard those things that they're

5866.0 --> 5872.4
beholding and that conjures a collective

5868.96 --> 5875.44
Mystic realm an idea of a place that

5872.4 --> 5880.48
doesn't actually exist but it exists in

5875.44 --> 5883.159
the people's minds that consider it

5880.48 --> 5885.5599999999995
existing it's a consideration just like

5883.159 --> 5890.0
the consideration of Earth curve and the

5885.56 --> 5890.0
Horizon supposedly being a geometric

5890.92 --> 5894.92
obstruction it's all about the

5892.76 --> 5899.119000000001
consideration and that consideration

5894.92 --> 5902.32
then opens up the door for the

5899.119 --> 5907.799999999999
acceptance of a mystical realm it's

5902.32 --> 5907.799999999999
mysticism it's a mystery religion the

5916.88 --> 5924.4800000000005
globe all right anybody still out there

5921.52 --> 5924.4800000000005
everybody just go

5928.639 --> 5933.8
away it's getting kind of worsome just

5931.239 --> 5936.199
seeing a bunch of dupons and akumu virus

5933.8 --> 5936.1990000000005
in my

5960.04 --> 5966.88
chat did everybody seriously leave

5963.52 --> 5966.88
without a single up

5967.679 --> 5975.0
vote stream's going for an hour and 38

5971.88 --> 5978.56
minutes and there's literally a zero

5975.0 --> 5978.56
here what the hell

5981.88 --> 5988.08
guys oh wait no there's a five hm I had

5986.199 --> 5989.638999999999
to refresh that that's weird normally

5988.08 --> 5993.04
auto

5989.639 --> 5993.04
updates never mind

6000.0 --> 6005.44
hey mystical Rock the fossils glad to

6001.8 --> 6007.360000000001
see you still there don't connect

6005.44 --> 6012.119
Mystics with the

6007.36 --> 6012.119
ball Mystics no but it

6012.639 --> 6016.28
is it's

6017.08 --> 6023.04
technical yeah I'm not talking about the

6019.92 --> 6026.4
mystics of like God within like the

6023.04 --> 6031.599
spirit within of course the internal

6026.4 --> 6038.199
world is Mystical I'm not talking about

6031.599 --> 6038.1990000000005
that the globe is technically a mystery

6039.44 --> 6049.32
religion see because it's based on a

6044.639 --> 6052.36
story that's created and it it it's

6049.32 --> 6054.84
about the realm that's in the

6052.36 --> 6057.639
mind that's what makes it a mystery

6054.84 --> 6061.4400000000005
religion yeah the old Greeks did the

6057.639 --> 6065.679
same thing with the

6061.44 --> 6070.598999999999
gods yeah the old Pantheon gods in their

6065.679 --> 6073.719
stories that was the mystery religion

6070.599 --> 6075.92
that realm those stories they made that

6073.719 --> 6078.599
realm real to those people that were

6075.92 --> 6081.84
taught that and though people would live

6078.599 --> 6086.08
and die sometimes for these ideas

6081.84 --> 6088.8
yeah that's what makes it a mystery

6086.08 --> 6089.76
religion because the people are told

6088.8 --> 6092.28
this is

6089.76 --> 6094.56
real it's not like oh you have to

6092.28 --> 6097.759999999999
believe this no they thought this is

6094.56 --> 6100.719
real and so they believe it's

6097.76 --> 6105.159000000001
real that's what makes it like a mystery

6100.719 --> 6107.719
religion it's kept a mystery that it is

6105.159 --> 6110.5599999999995
a religion it's just said no this is

6107.719 --> 6113.0
just reality and everything that opposes

6110.56 --> 6113.0
this is is

6115.4 --> 6122.239
wrong

6118.36 --> 6125.4
right so it's a religion

6122.239 --> 6127.919999999999
that's disclaimed to be a religion and

6125.4 --> 6131.36
that makes it a mystery

6127.92 --> 6132.04
religion because the religion part is

6131.36 --> 6134.598999999999
the

6132.04 --> 6137.32
mystery Rel a religion that's not

6134.599 --> 6137.32
claimed to be a

6139.08 --> 6145.639
religion right just like

6142.639 --> 6145.639
atheism

6152.719 --> 6158.84
ironically what mystery the

6156.28 --> 6161.28
mystery that everything you've been

6158.84 --> 6165.32
taught about how the Earth is a globe is

6161.28 --> 6169.28
a lie that's the mystery akumo virus the

6165.32 --> 6172.84
mystery is it's all

6169.28 --> 6176.92
[Â __Â ] and that's kept from you and

6172.84 --> 6180.52
you keep it from you you keep the

6176.92 --> 6184.159
realization that it's all [Â __Â ] from

6180.52 --> 6188.2390000000005
entering you your Consciousness your

6184.159 --> 6190.32
heart to reinforce the faith that the

6188.239 --> 6192.759999999999
Earth is a globe and that it's all like

6190.32 --> 6196.5199999999995
that it's a

6192.76 --> 6199.8
faith you're kept in the mystery about

6196.52 --> 6202.400000000001
what is real and you reinforce that

6199.8 --> 6204.4400000000005
mystery

6202.4 --> 6207.638999999999
through willing

6204.44 --> 6212.598999999999
ignorance and mental

6207.639 --> 6212.599
gymnastics that makes it a mystery

6213.119 --> 6218.88
religion Cults typically operate on a

6216.52 --> 6221.76
mystery religion

6218.88 --> 6223.32
too thing that is believed in a story

6221.76 --> 6227.400000000001
said you want to know more about the

6223.32 --> 6229.239
story and but it's claimed to be real

6227.4 --> 6231.48
and it's really important eventually

6229.239 --> 6234.119
that the story is seen as

6231.48 --> 6236.04
real that's typical that's a typical

6234.119 --> 6238.598999999999
mystery religion

6236.04 --> 6241.96
trait story comes into

6238.599 --> 6246.56
being and then the story is really

6241.96 --> 6246.56
prominent it's really important and

6250.52 --> 6253.52
real

6254.08 --> 6262.08
right just go outside and

6257.88 --> 6266.2390000000005
don't yeah somebody's squirting kumu

6262.08 --> 6266.239
having a hard time handling all of

6266.599 --> 6272.4800000000005
that right anyway going to take a

6269.08 --> 6272.48
two-minute break I'll be right

6289.56 --> 6292.56
back

6319.48 --> 6322.48
for

6379.4 --> 6382.4
for

6392.08 --> 6394.599
and I'm

6394.65 --> 6397.759999999999
[Music]

6398.52 --> 6402.159000000001
back cold

6408.199 --> 6412.4
cold hey shite

6413.88 --> 6418.719
glad to see all these people back it's

6416.44 --> 6418.719
been

6422.76 --> 6429.719
ages right but one thing I would love to

6425.84 --> 6432.400000000001
do as a flat arur if I had massive

6429.719 --> 6434.199
resources blah blah blah blah blah which

6432.4 --> 6436.839999999999
I probably won't

6434.199 --> 6437.678999999999
ever but one thing that I definitely

6436.84 --> 6443.119000000001
would

6437.679 --> 6443.119
do is figure out this damn equator

6443.8 --> 6452.52
man like can you imagine it just like

6449.199 --> 6454.5599999999995
once the orientation of the Equator has

6452.52 --> 6459.400000000001
been truly

6454.56 --> 6459.400000000001
measured like that's just

6459.639 --> 6462.639
bang

6462.92 --> 6467.84
bang paradigms permanently

6469.32 --> 6476.4
destroyed yeah it's like oh yeah turns

6473.639 --> 6478.52
out the Equator was a straight line well

6476.4 --> 6481.08
there you go no more [Â __Â ] dis

6478.52 --> 6483.679
earthers you're all wrong now doesn't

6481.08 --> 6487.0
matter what you hoped and dreamed and

6483.679 --> 6490.639
assume it's all gone

6487.0 --> 6493.119
done wrong no

6490.639 --> 6495.4800000000005
disc you can throw that [Â __Â ] in the

6493.119 --> 6501.839999999999
garbage bin now it was a

6495.48 --> 6503.239
nice creative moment it is wrong

6501.84 --> 6504.76
I mean it's better looking than the

6503.239 --> 6507.678999999999
globe I'll give you that right snow

6504.76 --> 6510.400000000001
globe Earth it's cute but it's probably

6507.679 --> 6514.84
wrong and as soon as the equator has

6510.4 --> 6517.598999999999
been properly measured we can prove that

6514.84 --> 6521.92
because I am very confident that the

6517.599 --> 6523.32
equator is not an actual literal

6521.92 --> 6527.36
geometric

6523.32 --> 6529.199
circle of on Earth I think it's much

6527.36 --> 6532.199
more like a straight

6529.199 --> 6532.199
line

6532.599 --> 6537.159000000001
but yeah you'd got to actually measure

6537.96 --> 6542.719
that right and not using map projection

6541.56 --> 6545.92
hor

6542.719 --> 6548.679
[Â __Â ] no literally

6545.92 --> 6551.96
measure like you go with a ship you go

6548.679 --> 6553.56
with an Airship would probably

6551.96 --> 6556.8
help

6553.56 --> 6561.320000000001
like an Airship that could

6556.8 --> 6563.119000000001
also like get in the water and like scan

6561.32 --> 6564.88
the ocean bottom that would be the best

6563.119 --> 6568.159
thing an Airship so you could get over

6564.88 --> 6570.119
the land part but that can also touch

6568.159 --> 6572.719
down on the ocean so it could literally

6570.119 --> 6577.5599999999995
scan the ocean bottom and all

6572.719 --> 6579.4
that right and then yeah the combined

6577.56 --> 6581.599
vericle like that you could literally

6579.4 --> 6584.159
like try to follow the

6581.599 --> 6588.2390000000005
equator like really keep real careful

6584.159 --> 6588.239
track of the celestials and all

6589.119 --> 6593.4
that and basically start

6595.199 --> 6603.638999999999
mapping right and not like mapping from

6599.119 --> 6606.32
scratch the entire equator from

6603.639 --> 6610.36
scratch and

6606.32 --> 6613.48
dude it may end result into some really

6610.36 --> 6615.4
weird [Â __Â ] and I'm not talking about

6613.48 --> 6619.32
whoa J how to be perfect straight line

6615.4 --> 6621.08
or an arc but like what if the equator

6619.32 --> 6622.759999999999
like guys

6621.08 --> 6623.92
I'm not saying this is literally but

6622.76 --> 6627.0
this could

6623.92 --> 6632.2390000000005
happen okay you could get into some

6627.0 --> 6634.76
weird asymmetrical looping [Â __Â ] okay and

6632.239 --> 6637.598999999999
that's like freaky so the equator could

6634.76 --> 6640.88
turn out to be like yeah it's a straight

6637.599 --> 6645.76
line and then it went in a corner and

6640.88 --> 6648.400000000001
like what broken corners and like ah

6645.76 --> 6650.159000000001
like what the [Â __Â ] is this equator line

6648.4 --> 6652.879999999999
what do you mean a straight line it's a

6650.159 --> 6656.5199999999995
mess it could be that it's actually

6652.88 --> 6659.2390000000005
always been a giant mess and they just

6656.52 --> 6662.599
kind of like made it into a smooth thing

6659.239 --> 6664.919999999999
for the projection yeah that could be

6662.599 --> 6667.8
the case it could be the case that it's

6664.92 --> 6670.4400000000005
literally a

6667.8 --> 6673.0
mess and

6670.44 --> 6678.079
that it's

6673.0 --> 6678.96
only smoo out to make the map projection

6678.079 --> 6681.96
work

6678.96 --> 6681.96
better

6683.88 --> 6691.56
okay you'll only know for sure once

6687.4 --> 6695.4
you've from scratch scanned and

6691.56 --> 6698.1990000000005
mapped the entire equator

6695.4 --> 6700.638999999999
region including ocean

6698.199 --> 6703.48
bottom as far as possible I mean it

6700.639 --> 6705.599
might be very tough to like scan the

6703.48 --> 6708.959999999999
Marana trench or

6705.599 --> 6711.4800000000005
something right that might be almost

6708.96 --> 6713.8
impossible

6711.48 --> 6716.759999999999
or you need some really heavy military

6713.8 --> 6718.4400000000005
Gr stuff or something I don't know but

6716.76 --> 6720.2390000000005
the point is you should be able to like

6718.44 --> 6722.759999999999
get most of

6720.239 --> 6724.5199999999995
it and just I don't know Skip the

6722.76 --> 6727.719
Mariana Trench or

6724.52 --> 6730.56
something as long as you can get like

6727.719 --> 6732.76
the sides of it properly lined up it

6730.56 --> 6736.320000000001
doesn't really matter

6732.76 --> 6736.320000000001
right it's not

6736.639 --> 6741.88
like as wide as an entire continent or

6739.52 --> 6741.88
anything

6741.92 --> 6747.119
so it should be doable you should be

6744.48 --> 6750.199
able to map the entire equator

6747.119 --> 6752.88
region and then figure out okay so how

6750.199 --> 6755.5199999999995
does this actually

6752.88 --> 6757.76
connect and then just like pieces of the

6755.52 --> 6760.360000000001
puzzle you start with the equator reg

6757.76 --> 6763.079000000001
you just put it all together like a

6760.36 --> 6766.4
perfect really

6763.079 --> 6768.679
Asis ukian

6766.4 --> 6771.119
representation literally as is as

6768.679 --> 6773.96
literal as you can get

6771.119 --> 6776.32
and then from that point on well once

6773.96 --> 6778.92
that's successful massive amounts of

6776.32 --> 6780.159
information would be revealed of the

6778.92 --> 6782.92
nature of the

6780.159 --> 6784.079
realm and then who knows you might be

6782.92 --> 6787.079
able to

6784.079 --> 6790.04
like get everything rolling to then okay

6787.079 --> 6792.119
let's do the rest you know let's do the

6790.04 --> 6794.079
rest of Earth and then see what this

6792.119 --> 6796.92
realm really

6794.079 --> 6798.759999999999
is but you definitely would have to

6796.92 --> 6802.4400000000005
start at the

6798.76 --> 6806.119000000001
equator which is also like universally

6802.44 --> 6809.32
the most attainable region because it's

6806.119 --> 6809.32
not frozen

6813.88 --> 6816.88
shot

6825.84 --> 6831.76
anyway I made a Akuma virus go away

6832.079 --> 6836.199
maybe maybe it just got worn

6839.28 --> 6845.079
out I

6841.36 --> 6849.239
mean giving free rain to ball tarded

6845.079 --> 6851.44
reflexes is re really tiresome so it

6849.239 --> 6855.199
does make

6851.44 --> 6855.199
sense that he got kind of

6858.679 --> 6861.679
knackered

6884.119 --> 6888.679
what all right anyway I hope you guys

6886.32 --> 6891.679
are all enjoying the

6888.679 --> 6891.679
show

6893.159 --> 6901.04
if you are please support your local

6896.76 --> 6901.04
Arwin I'm really doing my best

6901.079 --> 6908.84
here to keep it enjoyable

6905.239 --> 6912.36
informative and to help you

6908.84 --> 6915.4800000000005
remind to help remind you of all these

6912.36 --> 6917.159
things because most what has been

6915.48 --> 6920.079
discussed here today

6917.159 --> 6921.239
is has been rolled out in like the last

6920.079 --> 6926.719
year

6921.239 --> 6929.36
so I'm just reiterating important things

6926.719 --> 6929.36
to keep in

6930.719 --> 6937.199
mind and also of course where I want to

6933.56 --> 6942.400000000001
go as a flat earther if

6937.199 --> 6942.4
ever beyond my own doorstep here

6945.599 --> 6951.1990000000005
right I want to measure that equator I

6948.76 --> 6952.2390000000005
want to measure how it is is it is it a

6951.199 --> 6955.28
straight

6952.239 --> 6957.799999999999
line I mean I seriously can't wait like

6955.28 --> 6959.5199999999995
as soon as it like can you imagine that

6957.8 --> 6961.84
it like really turns out to be a

6959.52 --> 6965.56
straight line I am going to just say

6961.84 --> 6969.0
looping looping looping looping looping

6965.56 --> 6971.52
looping looping looping looping until

6969.0 --> 6974.88
everybody starts

6971.52 --> 6978.639
crying admitting yes Arwin you were

6974.88 --> 6981.119
[Â __Â ] right it's looping it's [Â __Â ]

6978.639 --> 6983.88
looping

6981.119 --> 6987.719
so weird yeah it's

6983.88 --> 6990.4400000000005
looping what is looping the

6987.719 --> 6993.88
realm east to

6990.44 --> 6993.879999999999
west there's a

6995.48 --> 7002.04
loop like a tunnel the realm itself is

6999.679 --> 7002.04
like a

7004.28 --> 7011.48
tunnel but we don't even know the full

7006.88 --> 7011.4800000000005
dimensions of this tunnel like

7012.199 --> 7017.759999999999
construct just that it Loops in on

7014.4 --> 7020.119
itself that's my big suspicion for very

7017.76 --> 7020.119000000001
long

7024.639 --> 7029.4800000000005
time and I believe that's the case and I

7027.28 --> 7032.04
believe that that literally fixes

7029.48 --> 7034.919999999999
absolutely everything all the scaling

7032.04 --> 7034.92
issues all of

7035.56 --> 7044.079000000001
it it's the very reason I started my

7041.56 --> 7046.0
channel it started really with figuring

7044.079 --> 7047.84
out that the sun is holographic that was

7046.0 --> 7048.599
the first thing I rolled out there even

7047.84 --> 7052.4800000000005
in

7048.599 --> 7054.09
2015 but the second place was like

7052.48 --> 7055.32
wait wait a

7054.09 --> 7058.0
[Music]

7055.32 --> 7059.92
minute there's something really weird

7058.0 --> 7061.8
here with the scale consistencies of

7059.92 --> 7064.92
that dis map that there's something

7061.8 --> 7064.92
wrong wrong

7065.76 --> 7072.280000000001
wrong and it

7068.239 --> 7075.839999999999
is it's it is wrong yeah it doesn't fit

7072.28 --> 7078.32
the dis map is a is a crunch the north

7075.84 --> 7081.96
is crunched in there and the south is

7078.32 --> 7085.84
stretched out it's not consistent skill

7081.96 --> 7088.639
in other words it's not a literal disc

7085.84 --> 7092.119000000001
that's not a literal representation of

7088.639 --> 7098.32
ukian reality it's a map

7092.119 --> 7101.32
projection that's been composed into a

7098.32 --> 7101.32
disc

7101.84 --> 7107.360000000001
and it's not to

7104.76 --> 7110.159000000001
scale it's not the real

7107.36 --> 7112.719
thing and that's already proven I don't

7110.159 --> 7117.119
need I don't even need to measure

7112.719 --> 7118.679
anything I can just prove it by just

7117.119 --> 7121.639
like yeah how about the scale

7118.679 --> 7124.4800000000005
consistencies there and that's

7121.639 --> 7128.04
done right but how could you get this

7124.48 --> 7130.36
consistency of the scale better well the

7128.04 --> 7133.36
best version thus far

7130.36 --> 7135.44
is like a tunnel is the tunnel

7133.36 --> 7138.839999999999
projection or the

7135.44 --> 7142.5599999999995
tube east to west scroll

7138.84 --> 7142.56
tube is the best

7143.8 --> 7151.52
version to get the scale cons

7147.84 --> 7151.52
consistent it's the best

7152.52 --> 7156.56
version and it's not perfect

7158.239 --> 7161.239
still

7162.239 --> 7167.879999999999
but it's it's closer than the dis

7164.92 --> 7167.88
projection at

7170.0 --> 7176.719
least right but

7173.56 --> 7178.360000000001
hey if the equator is a straight

7176.719 --> 7180.84
line

7178.36 --> 7182.88
then there's only one logical

7180.84 --> 7185.719
explanation and that is that there is a

7182.88 --> 7188.88
loop east to

7185.719 --> 7190.44
west if you move there and you end up in

7188.88 --> 7194.119
the same same

7190.44 --> 7196.598999999999
spot yeah when you go into a dead

7194.119 --> 7199.199
reckoning straight line and not around

7196.599 --> 7203.4800000000005
in a circle

7199.199 --> 7206.879999999999
yeah so while the

7203.48 --> 7210.199
globers claim that when you walk the

7206.88 --> 7214.159000000001
equator you go in a circle right you go

7210.199 --> 7216.159
over the horizon and you come back

7214.159 --> 7219.759999999999
that's the idea of the globe

7216.159 --> 7222.0
oh yeah and then you have that disc and

7219.76 --> 7224.320000000001
they think no you don't go over the

7222.0 --> 7228.8
curve you go in a

7224.32 --> 7231.679
circle oh yes it's a

7228.8 --> 7234.28
circle yeah and I'm saying yeah screw

7231.679 --> 7237.639
both of those it's a it's a freaking

7234.28 --> 7240.44
straight line man you go that way and

7237.639 --> 7242.8
then you end up right back there and you

7240.44 --> 7246.119
end up again you can go the same road

7242.8 --> 7248.92
walk to the same road your entire life

7246.119 --> 7249.96
and pass the the same things multiple

7248.92 --> 7252.599
times

7249.96 --> 7255.119
times and all that time you moved in a

7252.599 --> 7258.360000000001
perfect straight

7255.119 --> 7260.639
line and that doesn't exist if there is

7258.36 --> 7263.5599999999995
not a loop it can't exist if there's not

7260.639 --> 7267.599
a loop within the

7263.56 --> 7270.52
realm not locked into a bubble with

7267.599 --> 7272.92
walls on all sides there might be a wall

7270.52 --> 7275.4400000000005
somewhere a actual

7272.92 --> 7277.96
barrier but it's it wouldn't be there

7275.44 --> 7280.839999999999
east to west so if you end up in the

7277.96 --> 7284.599
same spot well that means it's

7280.84 --> 7287.4800000000005
looping and you could translate into

7284.599 --> 7289.96
astrophysics language and say there's a

7287.48 --> 7293.28
wormhole we're locked in a

7289.96 --> 7296.119
wormhole right space is bent and so

7293.28 --> 7298.28
there's on this side of the realm it's

7296.119 --> 7300.28
interconnected with that side of the

7298.28 --> 7302.8
realm and so it's a

7300.28 --> 7305.44
Continuum a

7302.8 --> 7307.679
wormhole that's the astrophysics blah

7305.44 --> 7310.44
blah blah explanation for what that

7307.679 --> 7312.719
would be I'm just saying no it's just

7310.44 --> 7315.919999999999
looping it's just this is the available

7312.719 --> 7319.76
space this is how it interconnects and

7315.92 --> 7322.36
that's it it's just the setup

7319.76 --> 7325.119000000001
right just like Pac-Man it's just yeah

7322.36 --> 7326.719
that's the way it's set up yeah right

7325.119 --> 7329.5599999999995
side of the screen interconnects with

7326.719 --> 7332.84
the left side of the screen can

7329.56 --> 7336.2390000000005
move left to right right to left and

7332.84 --> 7339.360000000001
that's just the way it's programmed it's

7336.239 --> 7343.638999999999
the way it's designed it's set up I

7339.36 --> 7346.44
don't see any difficulty with accepting

7343.639 --> 7348.92
that right it's like oh my God a loop

7346.44 --> 7352.199
that doesn't make any physical sense

7348.92 --> 7355.079
things can only be exactly like how I

7352.199 --> 7357.799999999999
see right things in front of me when I

7355.079 --> 7360.639
made them and I can't make a thing

7357.8 --> 7364.4800000000005
that's looping in on itself so it can't

7360.639 --> 7367.079
be real damn it yeah that's the response

7364.48 --> 7370.959999999999
of people physical assumption bias

7367.079 --> 7370.96
playing at you again

7371.36 --> 7378.44
yeah so you'd rather accept a model of

7375.199 --> 7380.5199999999995
physical reality that has blatant and

7378.44 --> 7382.678999999999
obvious scale

7380.52 --> 7386.719
inconsistencies then you could accept

7382.679 --> 7386.719
that maybe the Realms just

7387.04 --> 7392.36
looping because you can't make a model

7390.4 --> 7394.679
out of that

7392.36 --> 7397.119
looping if you can make a model out of

7394.679 --> 7399.2390000000005
the looping if you can show it in a

7397.119 --> 7401.159
miniature right in front of you then

7399.239 --> 7404.48
who's going to believe

7401.159 --> 7406.92
me right that's why we got to use the

7404.48 --> 7409.36
disc because you can make a miniature of

7406.92 --> 7411.88
that and then you can say this is the

7409.36 --> 7415.0
realm even though it's

7411.88 --> 7417.4800000000005
wrong but if we were to show it like

7415.0 --> 7419.32
looping like well there's a hole there

7417.48 --> 7421.678999999999
and then the people would ask but

7419.32 --> 7424.5199999999995
there's a hole there and you say yeah

7421.679 --> 7426.28
but it's connected to the other side

7424.52 --> 7429.88
like

7426.28 --> 7431.96
but that makes no sense

7429.88 --> 7434.76
and then you'd

7431.96 --> 7438.199
say it's just the way it

7434.76 --> 7440.559
is and then you'd feel kind of stupid

7438.199 --> 7443.678999999999
and then you're like damn it why is

7440.559 --> 7446.400000000001
reality so freaking

7443.679 --> 7449.52
complicated why is the more real you get

7446.4 --> 7452.839999999999
the more inacceptable it gets to the

7449.52 --> 7455.84
general public why is the closer you get

7452.84 --> 7457.8
to the actual accuracy of reality the

7455.84 --> 7460.599
more it gets

7457.8 --> 7464.4400000000005
rejected

7460.599 --> 7467.96
yeah welcome to Flat

7464.44 --> 7469.598999999999
Earth the more real you get the more you

7467.96 --> 7471.639
get

7469.599 --> 7474.8
rejected yeah and that's why all the

7471.639 --> 7476.719
numpty flat earther [Â __Â ] talkers

7474.8 --> 7478.599
that have the worst arguments and the

7476.719 --> 7481.159
worst debating

7478.599 --> 7484.119000000001
skills that's why they get all the

7481.159 --> 7486.04
numbers that's why they get all the all

7484.119 --> 7488.119
the super chats and the connections and

7486.04 --> 7489.88
the praise and they get the invites and

7488.119 --> 7491.558999999999
everybody loves them because they're

7489.88 --> 7494.159000000001
[Â __Â ]

7491.559 --> 7496.76
[Â __Â ] and that's what everybody

7494.159 --> 7499.0
that's what makes feel people safe yeah

7496.76 --> 7501.96
it's like oh thank God thank God the

7499.0 --> 7505.8
flat earthers are [Â __Â ] oh my God now

7501.96 --> 7508.559
I can just go on with my life

7505.8 --> 7512.1990000000005
and and worry about the nonsense that

7508.559 --> 7515.2390000000005
I'm told to worry about and not and not

7512.199 --> 7517.119
get this shining inkline of an idea that

7515.239 --> 7519.718999999999
maybe it's all

7517.119 --> 7521.719
[Â __Â ] maybe I was fooled all along

7519.719 --> 7524.159
and I'm just following orders that make

7521.719 --> 7527.76
no sense that are to my own detriment

7524.159 --> 7530.679
and thank God those stupid flat earthers

7527.76 --> 7534.719
that are out there are always messing up

7530.679 --> 7537.04
yeah so that I I I can't figure it like

7534.719 --> 7540.599
yeah because if they're all stupid then

7537.04 --> 7544.679
why would you even ask right because oh

7540.599 --> 7547.360000000001
you got proof again right the same proof

7544.679 --> 7549.639
when you were six and you asked like hey

7547.36 --> 7552.36
what about the Earth and this say look

7549.639 --> 7555.119
this is the globe

7552.36 --> 7557.239
Earth and and before that they show you

7555.119 --> 7559.48
like the disc Earth or with a dome and

7557.239 --> 7562.119
you're like oh what's that wow and no

7559.48 --> 7564.4
that's stupid that's dumb flat earther

7562.119 --> 7566.799999999999
stuff you don't even know how to talk

7564.4 --> 7569.28
properly but they'll yell at you for

7566.8 --> 7572.679
that and this the globe Earth this is

7569.28 --> 7574.88
the real thing yeah and you can all

7572.679 --> 7577.4400000000005
reinforce that

7574.88 --> 7579.88
conditioning you can all just be oh

7577.44 --> 7581.598999999999
thank God my teacher didn't lie to me

7579.88 --> 7583.52
and like traumatize me when I was

7581.599 --> 7585.76
6-year-old when he told me that flat

7583.52 --> 7588.400000000001
earthers were stupid because look

7585.76 --> 7590.119000000001
there's these really stupid people that

7588.4 --> 7592.598999999999
identify as flat earthers and they're

7590.119 --> 7596.5199999999995
just messing up their

7592.599 --> 7599.8
nonsense thank God I I can just sleep

7596.52 --> 7601.719
safely and not feel threatened by people

7599.8 --> 7604.52
that have just molested and

7601.719 --> 7606.28
indoctrinated my mind throughout my life

7604.52 --> 7608.719
and they're and they're doing it to your

7606.28 --> 7611.84
children too and don't have to think

7608.719 --> 7614.159
about that because thank God those

7611.84 --> 7615.4400000000005
really dumb flat earthers just they

7614.159 --> 7618.239
don't know what they're talking about

7615.44 --> 7618.239
they can't make an

7618.32 --> 7626.799999999999
argument right that's that's

7623.44 --> 7629.919999999999
safe so they get promoted cuz they just

7626.8 --> 7635.52
help everybody to just roll on to the

7629.92 --> 7637.88
end right to your final Doom in your

7635.52 --> 7639.639
illusion right while people that snap

7637.88 --> 7642.04
you out of it is like what the [Â __Â ] this

7639.639 --> 7646.599
flat earther makes sense that's not good

7642.04 --> 7646.599
ah my life ah Burns

7646.88 --> 7651.719
this right that's what happens when you

7650.44 --> 7656.199
get faced with

7651.719 --> 7659.8
me cuz I don't mess things up I don't

7656.199 --> 7662.638999999999
mess arguments up I move Way Beyond the

7659.8 --> 7665.88
average comfort zone when it comes to

7662.639 --> 7667.159000000001
figuring things out about the realm or

7665.88 --> 7671.28
about

7667.159 --> 7671.28
psychology or about about the far

7678.639 --> 7684.36
past lies in the media truth in video

7684.76 --> 7688.88
games a little

7696.84 --> 7701.079
sure there's plenty a [Â __Â ] in video

7699.599 --> 7704.079
games

7701.079 --> 7706.119
though I mean I still play Civilization

7704.079 --> 7708.239
5 and it it's

7706.119 --> 7709.759999999999
continually I mean the whole thing is

7708.239 --> 7712.5199999999995
just programming

7709.76 --> 7715.2390000000005
nonsense I'm like disturbed by it like

7712.52 --> 7718.360000000001
often I'm like I want to like be in the

7715.239 --> 7722.079
game and like rebel against the system

7718.36 --> 7725.92
like against like the flow of the game

7722.079 --> 7728.639
because it's like no no you don't need

7725.92 --> 7730.119
to invent that hor [Â __Â ] you can go go

7728.639 --> 7733.2390000000005
straight to

7730.119 --> 7736.4
that because I know how it actually

7733.239 --> 7738.36
works in reality now I know I know that

7736.4 --> 7740.119
it's not just oh this and then that and

7738.36 --> 7743.04
like no that's horeshit that's not how

7740.119 --> 7746.28
it actually works I know that the entire

7743.04 --> 7750.119
idea of like how everything evolved from

7746.28 --> 7753.079
the story Ed is absolute hor [Â __Â ] you

7750.119 --> 7755.04
can't fool me with that again yeah so

7753.079 --> 7757.92
every time I play Civilization 5 yeah

7755.04 --> 7761.159
it's cool but I'm continually annoyed

7757.92 --> 7764.159
how I'm just being so damn railroaded

7761.159 --> 7766.04
into thinking about things how it all

7764.159 --> 7767.638999999999
supposedly develop in a way that's just

7766.04 --> 7770.04
not

7767.639 --> 7775.079
realistic and that kind of annoying but

7770.04 --> 7779.84
it can never be helped so truth in video

7775.079 --> 7782.44
games yeah no no there's a lot of

7779.84 --> 7786.1990000000005
programming reinforcement in games a lot

7782.44 --> 7788.4
of it yeah just because the media the

7786.199 --> 7791.638999999999
mainstream media is getting so much

7788.4 --> 7793.36
worse doesn't mean that video game's

7791.639 --> 7796.32
good

7793.36 --> 7800.679
okay there's been plenty of

7796.32 --> 7805.28
transhumanist programming in video games

7800.679 --> 7805.28
plenty yeah it's not all

7817.239 --> 7820.239
good

7820.719 --> 7825.719
right but I mean yeah Ry says that sure

7825.04 --> 7828.32
why

7825.719 --> 7829.84
not but I mean it's it's not entirely

7828.32 --> 7832.84
true

7829.84 --> 7835.159000000001
though but I guess that the media is

7832.84 --> 7838.8
degenerating more on average than the

7835.159 --> 7842.119
video games even but I mean look closer

7838.8 --> 7844.119000000001
and and you'll figure out it's it too is

7842.119 --> 7847.32
going

7844.119 --> 7849.88
down the overall video game quality has

7847.32 --> 7852.679
like really gone

7849.88 --> 7857.88
down it's like it's getting the same

7852.679 --> 7861.4400000000005
diseases as as uh as movie land

7857.88 --> 7864.4400000000005
basically regurgitation nonsense right

7861.44 --> 7867.719
all these new movies are all recycled

7864.44 --> 7869.558999999999
[Â __Â ] they're version five or six of

7867.719 --> 7872.0
another

7869.559 --> 7874.84
movie cuz they don't really they barely

7872.0 --> 7880.159
come up with new stuff yeah video game

7874.84 --> 7882.96
world has the same issue and even worse

7880.159 --> 7885.44
they re rot it even

7882.96 --> 7886.96
more because it's just all these Mega

7885.44 --> 7889.04
corporate they're all like oh we have to

7886.96 --> 7891.4
get the winning formula we have to just

7889.04 --> 7893.159
the winning formula and then oh this is

7891.4 --> 7895.32
the winning formula everybody's like

7893.159 --> 7898.159
exactly that we're going to do exactly

7895.32 --> 7898.159
that the winning

7899.119 --> 7902.32
formula and

7906.079 --> 7911.0
so there's a lot of railroad roing in

7911.119 --> 7916.239
games like bigger bigger games but at

7914.159 --> 7918.719
the same time there's still plenty of

7916.239 --> 7921.919999999999
people that are just like making their

7918.719 --> 7925.199
own silly little video games that are

7921.92 --> 7927.8
like yeah screw industry like we're just

7925.199 --> 7929.678999999999
making something silly and fun and

7927.8 --> 7933.360000000001
that's there too that's out there and

7929.679 --> 7937.28
programming has become a lot easier to

7933.36 --> 7940.199
do compared to say 20 years ago so like

7937.28 --> 7944.199
there's more people doing

7940.199 --> 7948.4
that so it's like the Grassroots smaller

7944.199 --> 7952.28
games versus industrial gaming which is

7948.4 --> 7952.28
all super standardized and

7956.639 --> 7963.52
boring when you use a compass and go

7960.239 --> 7966.598999999999
north that's magnetic north

7963.52 --> 7969.119000000001
yeah how do you determine True North

7966.599 --> 7972.8
based on the celestial lights

7969.119 --> 7976.4
True North should be where the where

7972.8 --> 7979.320000000001
Polaris is straight above you if that is

7976.4 --> 7982.04
actually physically possible there's no

7979.32 --> 7982.04
certainty of

7986.639 --> 7990.599
that no steamy

7991.44 --> 7995.879999999999
traveler the [Â __Â ] does that have to do

7993.639 --> 7998.159000000001
with it I mean you could make a loop in

7995.88 --> 8000.76
a level or whatever you could make make

7998.159 --> 8003.239
an entire level Loop in on itself you

8000.76 --> 8005.2390000000005
could do all kinds of

8003.239 --> 8010.839999999999
things

8005.239 --> 8010.839999999999
technically it's not really relevant

8011.199 --> 8016.719
though and no I'm not really making

8013.76 --> 8020.079000000001
progress on it like I I'd still have to

8016.719 --> 8022.0
like start figuring out programming and

8020.079 --> 8024.558999999999
it's just not

8022.0 --> 8026.0
happening like everybody freaking hates

8024.559 --> 8029.4800000000005
programming

8026.0 --> 8031.92
nobody gives a [Â __Â ] about me wanting to

8029.48 --> 8031.919999999999
learn

8032.679 --> 8039.36
that so nope nothing there will be

8036.88 --> 8039.36
nothing

8040.199 --> 8044.159
made maybe in 20

8045.239 --> 8051.079
years right maybe in 20 years there will

8048.04 --> 8053.719
be an AI bot thingy that I could just

8051.079 --> 8055.32
tell oh okay I got this parameters here

8053.719 --> 8058.52
could you make this game and it just

8055.32 --> 8062.0
makes it bop done

8058.52 --> 8062.0
nobody gives a [Â __Â ] anymore

8066.05 --> 8069.3
[Music]

8070.88 --> 8078.76
anyway right but hey give me a freaking

8076.199 --> 8081.48
budget you're not because n none of you

8078.76 --> 8083.96
can afford that but let's just say yeah

8081.48 --> 8086.879999999999
I can get a budget together for the game

8083.96 --> 8090.639
then yeah I can actually get a

8086.88 --> 8093.36
programmer to get to work on

8090.639 --> 8095.599
it because they will actually work on it

8093.36 --> 8097.4
and they will know what they're doing

8095.599 --> 8099.1990000000005
because they're being paid as a

8097.4 --> 8102.839999999999
programmer which they are

8099.199 --> 8105.799999999999
professionally which I will never be so

8102.84 --> 8110.04
yeah get the money and I could make it I

8105.8 --> 8113.2390000000005
can't now yeah I have other priorities

8110.04 --> 8119.8
like clothes that don't have holes in

8113.239 --> 8119.799999999999
them or food for the next week yeah

8142.079 --> 8145.679
referring to Pac-Man looping at

8146.8 --> 8149.8
what

8152.679 --> 8158.92
demonstration on the o yeah it would be

8155.04 --> 8161.88
blue build it would be a very serious

8158.92 --> 8166.159
project and there would have to be a a

8161.88 --> 8168.079
vessel designed and crafted specifically

8166.159 --> 8172.36
for

8168.079 --> 8172.36
that it would really have

8173.199 --> 8178.32
to yeah some

8175.84 --> 8179.719
regular ship or whatever ever is not

8178.32 --> 8183.0
going to do

8179.719 --> 8186.32
it it would have to be a like an

8183.0 --> 8190.92
exploration vessel that could go

8186.32 --> 8195.399
Airborne so a water ship that can

8190.92 --> 8200.28
literally like create a balloon like a

8195.399 --> 8200.279999999999
zappelin and lift off the

8206.679 --> 8209.679
water

8211.16 --> 8219.719
right because I mean that would be

8214.679 --> 8219.719000000001
incredibly convenient too for Icy

8224.24 --> 8229.28
exploration

8225.84 --> 8232.439
right because you would literally not

8229.28 --> 8234.519
have to have a ice

8232.439 --> 8237.319
breaker you're you're not going to get

8234.519 --> 8240.679
stuck in the ice if you can literally

8237.319 --> 8243.199999999999
cause yourself from getting stuck in the

8240.679 --> 8246.16
ice and just like skate over it like

8243.2 --> 8248.479000000001
balloon assistant skating with a giant

8246.16 --> 8250.92
ship over the ice if

8248.479 --> 8253.358999999999
necessary right make it lighter with the

8250.92 --> 8257.8
blue it's super cold so it's going to be

8253.359 --> 8259.559000000001
much tougher to have a balloon

8257.8 --> 8262.0
functioning

8259.559 --> 8263.679
there like you're not going to go high

8262.0 --> 8264.679
in the air with all that weight when

8263.679 --> 8268.399
it's that

8264.679 --> 8272.2
cold but you can still have it

8268.399 --> 8274.559
use the density offset to make it

8272.2 --> 8278.16
lighter so it could like more easily

8274.559 --> 8278.16
like skate over the

8287.08 --> 8290.08
ice

8296.519 --> 8299.519
right

8303.359 --> 8309.76
have to you helium based balloons

8307.519 --> 8313.439
definitely I mean this thing has got to

8309.76 --> 8318.0
be literally capable of lifting off the

8313.439 --> 8320.639000000001
air and like moving over

8318.0 --> 8324.359
mountains at least in the hot

8320.639 --> 8326.719
regions in the cold that's very

8324.359 --> 8328.800000000001
difficult but it has to be able to

8326.719 --> 8332.08
seriously LIF

8328.8 --> 8332.08
off the ground pretty

8352.319 --> 8356.439
far right so in in essence it would be

8355.399 --> 8358.199999999999
like

8356.439 --> 8362.0
a

8358.2 --> 8364.960000000001
a small Cruise liner combined with a

8362.0 --> 8364.96
retractable

8370.28 --> 8377.76
zapolin so that it can literally unfold

8373.28 --> 8378.800000000001
the zappelin and like and just go off

8377.76 --> 8382.679
this the

8378.8 --> 8384.8
ocean and land back on it and retract

8382.679 --> 8387.639
like suck the helium back

8384.8 --> 8389.56
up recompress it in the tanks and and

8387.639 --> 8392.519999999999
just deflate the balloon so you could

8389.56 --> 8393.92
completely retract it again why not a

8392.52 --> 8397.6
small

8393.92 --> 8401.479
boat uh because you want some

8397.6 --> 8401.479000000001
equipment and you want

8409.359 --> 8412.359
people

8416.359 --> 8420.84
supplies

8419.359 --> 8422.92
would be deployed when it's not too

8420.84 --> 8425.479
windy

8422.92 --> 8428.2
correct yes steamy

8425.479 --> 8433.119999999999
traveler well the Zeppelin would mostly

8428.2 --> 8435.84
be used to cross over land and should

8433.12 --> 8438.560000000001
must be capable of landing on land

8435.84 --> 8443.359
without breaking the

8438.56 --> 8449.319
boat okay but it it must be capable of

8443.359 --> 8449.319
being deployed so you can cross land

8451.56 --> 8455.399
and yeah that that's

8455.72 --> 8460.56
it but I mean if you're Crossing an

8458.359 --> 8461.84
ocean and it's storming all the time

8460.56 --> 8463.8
yeah you don't deploy the freaking

8461.84 --> 8467.68
zapolin

8463.8 --> 8470.479
yeah unless you can like somehow move

8467.68 --> 8473.2
over the storm could you imagine how

8470.479 --> 8476.199999999999
awesome that would be so there like

8473.2 --> 8478.76
you're like a a a decent size ship

8476.2 --> 8481.960000000001
Cruiser thing and there's like a damn

8478.76 --> 8483.6
storm it's like like holy [Â __Â ]

8481.96 --> 8486.24
everybody's getting sick because this a

8483.6 --> 8488.880000000001
freaking storm for a week well what if

8486.24 --> 8492.28
you instead could just like hm what if

8488.88 --> 8494.92
we just ride over the

8492.28 --> 8496.880000000001
storm it would be much better to keep

8494.92 --> 8500.6
track of the celestial lights that way

8496.88 --> 8503.479
anyway right so it's like oh [Â __Â ]

8500.6 --> 8506.04
there's a huge Stormfront there okay

8503.479 --> 8506.039999999999
deploy

8506.24 --> 8509.24
zappelin

8511.72 --> 8518.119999999999
and then it's

8513.72 --> 8521.0
like here is lifting up everybody's just

8518.12 --> 8524.28
W and then before you know it you're

8521.0 --> 8527.52
just flying no sound no more shaking

8524.28 --> 8530.319000000001
from the water and you just see these

8527.52 --> 8532.960000000001
storm clouds underneath

8530.319 --> 8534.76
you and the Sun hitting you and just

8532.96 --> 8539.599999999999
like

8534.76 --> 8543.399
whoa where we're moving over this St

8539.6 --> 8543.399000000001
that would be pretty epic if that was

8547.2 --> 8553.08
possible have a

8550.08 --> 8553.08
submarine

8559.24 --> 8562.24
no

8563.12 --> 8571.92
no no I well maybe

8568.64 --> 8574.96
but I mean steamy traveler you're making

8571.92 --> 8579.12
it like you don't understand like the

8574.96 --> 8581.519999999999
the actual architectural issues with a

8579.12 --> 8584.2
vessel that has to be capable of

8581.52 --> 8588.319000000001
withstanding pressures like a submarine

8584.2 --> 8590.800000000001
yeah because structural Integrity is

8588.319 --> 8593.039999999999
extremely important for that and like

8590.8 --> 8596.519999999999
everything must be sacrificed to make

8593.04 --> 8599.92
sure that it can implode well that's

8596.52 --> 8603.68
going to cause C it to have a huge

8599.92 --> 8605.8
amount of weight added to it that you

8603.68 --> 8607.56
don't really need if you just need your

8605.8 --> 8610.24
boat to

8607.56 --> 8614.439
float and that's probably going to make

8610.24 --> 8619.08
it absolutely impossible to make it

8614.439 --> 8620.960000000001
Airborne yeah I like the idea of like a

8619.08 --> 8621.92
zapolin that can be underwater and then

8620.96 --> 8623.839999999998
just

8621.92 --> 8626.64
like and

8623.84 --> 8630.319
then I mean that is an incredible idea

8626.64 --> 8635.039999999999
like a under the ocean and in the

8630.319 --> 8637.319
air but it's probably impossible because

8635.04 --> 8639.2
there requirements of structural

8637.319 --> 8641.96
Integrity especially if you're going to

8639.2 --> 8643.359
go in a Restless ocean that's in heavy

8641.96 --> 8644.96
storm or

8643.359 --> 8647.800000000001
whatever

8644.96 --> 8650.72
like it would just make it too heavy it

8647.8 --> 8654.319
it could then not leave the water I mean

8650.72 --> 8656.0
don't underestimate how incredibly heavy

8654.319 --> 8659.0
submarines

8656.0 --> 8659.0
are

8660.64 --> 8667.56
this not that's not

8665.279 --> 8668.84
nothing and like they have to be that

8667.56 --> 8671.68
heavy

8668.84 --> 8674.6
too and then they kind of compensate

8671.68 --> 8678.6
that by having pressurized air and all

8674.6 --> 8681.56
kinds of stuff in there so they can

8678.6 --> 8685.0
actually neutralize their density a bit

8681.56 --> 8685.96
and go back up but they're freaking

8685.0 --> 8688.96
heavy

8685.96 --> 8688.96
man

8689.68 --> 8694.359
huge inflatable memory salt water

8694.56 --> 8703.199999999999
okay hydrogen yeah can of bear oh I mean

8699.92 --> 8704.279
I like the idea but how about we don't

8703.2 --> 8708.16
do

8704.279 --> 8712.399000000001
that you see there's this thing about

8708.16 --> 8716.0
HHO you see mainly that it is

8712.399 --> 8718.88
literally the most explosive gas that

8716.0 --> 8721.8
exists and doesn't just burn it

8718.88 --> 8725.56
detonates yeah detonation that can

8721.8 --> 8725.56
literally shatter

8725.68 --> 8732.319
steel so let's not do that yeah just one

8729.88 --> 8735.199999999999
[Â __Â ] ass

8732.319 --> 8739.479
wipe that just has an idea of shooting a

8735.2 --> 8742.800000000001
freaking fire firecracker at you and

8739.479 --> 8743.8
like the entire project just detonates

8742.8 --> 8745.358999999999
into

8743.8 --> 8749.0
nothing

8745.359 --> 8751.399000000001
so how about we don't use hydrogen that

8749.0 --> 8752.92
would be great how about just using

8751.399 --> 8756.399
helium

8752.92 --> 8760.8
okay I mean come

8756.399 --> 8763.96
on this is not some unmanned balloon or

8760.8 --> 8767.519999999999
anything this is a heavy research

8763.96 --> 8770.039999999999
vessel you don't want to have a risk

8767.52 --> 8773.0
factor that freaking damn High man

8770.04 --> 8776.439
especially with globe religion being out

8773.0 --> 8779.96
there being against you okay let's not

8776.439 --> 8782.24
freaking can use hydrogen gas balloons

8779.96 --> 8782.24
for

8782.96 --> 8788.96
that in a world that is perfectly safe

8785.84 --> 8793.08
with no nefarious influences yeah

8788.96 --> 8793.08
sure but that's not

8794.96 --> 8803.479
real so let's just use helium for that

8799.279 --> 8803.479000000001
okay good to see you by the way canab

8803.56 --> 8811.08
bear I've really been appreciating a

8807.76 --> 8815.04
the Cannabis you sent me but I am afraid

8811.08 --> 8815.039999999999
that I'm probably going to run out in

8818.2 --> 8822.08
January maybe a bit

8822.72 --> 8827.8
later but you have effectively helped me

8825.6 --> 8831.6
save a lot of

8827.8 --> 8831.599999999999
cost so thank you for

8835.72 --> 8838.72
that

8854.56 --> 8858.72
no cruises from South America to

8859.479 --> 8864.679999999998
Australia yeah loopo Devolution but I

8862.439 --> 8867.2
mean that could have many

8864.68 --> 8871.359
reasons I mean the mid

8867.2 --> 8873.0
of like giant oceans is is rarely like a

8871.359 --> 8876.08
safe

8873.0 --> 8878.72
place I

8876.08 --> 8881.84
mean just for the record there's no

8878.72 --> 8884.96
actual satellites like that in those

8881.84 --> 8888.24
locations unless they're literally like

8884.96 --> 8891.399
Elon Musk send one of his thingy SpaceX

8888.24 --> 8893.6
or whatever to float with

8891.399 --> 8897.278999999999
yeah

8893.6 --> 8900.52
but it's just when it's so far away from

8897.279 --> 8903.439
all land it's really dangerous like

8900.52 --> 8907.76
that's why they don't fly over it so

8903.439 --> 8909.479000000001
always go past the land with cruises the

8907.76 --> 8913.319
middle of the ocean is not an

8909.479 --> 8916.358999999999
interesting place for visitors they want

8913.319 --> 8920.16
things to look at not just ocean

8916.359 --> 8921.800000000001
everywhere right they want spectacles so

8920.16 --> 8923.56
why the hell would you go to the middle

8921.8 --> 8926.8
of the ocean it's the most boring place

8923.56 --> 8928.64
to be for a cruise you want to go past

8926.8 --> 8930.759999999998
land so you have interesting things to

8928.64 --> 8934.64
look

8930.76 --> 8934.64
at and places to

8935.04 --> 8943.160000000002
dock for materials

8938.6 --> 8943.16
and and replenishing resources

8946.64 --> 8950.319
Etc man it's getting

8955.52 --> 8958.52
dark

8962.64 --> 8966.84
if you have a string of cloudy days

8964.8 --> 8969.479
nights it's hard to use Celestial

8966.84 --> 8972.880000000001
navigation well steamy traveler that's

8969.479 --> 8975.599999999999
the funny thing about having a

8972.88 --> 8979.319
Deployable

8975.6 --> 8981.56
zappelin yeah you can literally rise

8979.319 --> 8983.119999999999
above the clouds and do the measurement

8981.56 --> 8984.199999999999
you see there's this funny thing about

8983.12 --> 8987.2
Celestial

8984.2 --> 8988.880000000001
navigation namely that the angle of the

8987.2 --> 8992.76
celestial sphere that you're going to be

8988.88 --> 8995.96
looking at does not change at all with

8992.76 --> 8998.68
height so you can rise as far as you

8995.96 --> 9002.119999999999
need to above the clouds and then you

8998.68 --> 9005.92
can get a perfectly clear reading of the

9002.12 --> 9005.92
celestials in order to

9006.12 --> 9013.0
navigate it's very easy all you have to

9009.279 --> 9013.0
do is be able to ascend Above the

9015.439 --> 9018.439
Clouds

9018.76 --> 9022.439
