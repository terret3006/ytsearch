you for that

124.74 --> 131.51999999999998
right uh well first off of course yeah

128.34 --> 136.68
no show yesterday on Saturday

131.52 --> 140.4
because I was really [ __ ] up

136.68 --> 143.459
like yeah I mean

140.4 --> 145.62
I was really sick

143.459 --> 151.44
like

145.62 --> 153.3
in agony because yeah of a combination

151.44 --> 156.66
because Friday

153.3 --> 158.76000000000002
I thought hey let's

156.66 --> 161.819
instead of like trying a beer or

158.76 --> 163.98
something let's try red wine and like I

161.819 --> 167.28
got a little bottle like the smallest

163.98 --> 169.5
one that was there 25c

167.28 --> 171.54
and

169.5 --> 173.819
yeah it was even said on there it's like

171.54 --> 176.76
yeah this is for with pizza and I was

173.819 --> 179.51899999999998
actually having a pizza that afternoon

176.76 --> 183.72
so I thought like oh yeah great and well

179.519 --> 187.37900000000002
it tasted fine and it was kind of fun

183.72 --> 187.379
but yeah

187.56 --> 192.72
then something went really wrong and

190.62 --> 195.84
I thought at first like it's just the

192.72 --> 197.22
wine but it's also the freaking Weed Man

195.84 --> 198.42000000000002
I mean

197.22 --> 201.78
I

198.42 --> 203.39999999999998
had some new cannabis strain

201.78 --> 206.58
because they're the one that I was

203.4 --> 208.019
taking and was great we ran out so I

206.58 --> 210.84
picked a new one

208.019 --> 213.12
but yeah because I was also trying out

210.84 --> 215.81900000000002
wine I wasn't really paying too much

213.12 --> 219.019
attention but that stuff is freaking

215.819 --> 219.01899999999998
dangerous to me man

219.72 --> 226.85999999999999
because even yesterday night I was again

222.9 --> 229.019
sick but not like really sick but still

226.86 --> 231.42000000000002
like whoa I still feel really bad what

229.019 --> 233.159
is this like bad again

231.42 --> 236.57999999999998
well it's because of the freaking

233.159 --> 239.239
cannabis man there's some weird mystery

236.58 --> 239.239
strain or whatever

239.34 --> 247.019
so it is some strange hybrid and bad

243.84 --> 249.12
so I'm I put that back in the Box

247.019 --> 251.64000000000001
basically I'm not taking that anymore

249.12 --> 253.92000000000002
because

251.64 --> 256.139
it's bad

253.92 --> 259.32
right

256.139 --> 261.419
and I feel great when I don't use it it

259.32 --> 263.639
just it's surprising it took me so long

261.419 --> 267.35999999999996
to figure that out

263.639 --> 270.24
right but yesterday was really a messed

267.36 --> 274.62
up day for me

270.24 --> 276.78000000000003
hello do you not see first in chat

274.62 --> 279.54
homegrown is the best you have if only

276.78 --> 281.46
I've only had had the opportunity to do

279.54 --> 284.639
that but uh

281.46 --> 287.09999999999997
no but usually cannabis that I pick is

284.639 --> 288.78000000000003
just great but with this one it it was

287.1 --> 290.759
not

288.78 --> 292.85999999999996
and it's weird because it smelled like

290.759 --> 294.3
just any of the other types that I had

292.86 --> 295.8
so I thought like oh yeah it smells kind

294.3 --> 298.68
of the same that should be the same well

295.8 --> 300.3
no no it isn't

298.68 --> 303.5
laughs

300.3 --> 303.5
it's very treacherous

304.44 --> 309.979
yeah it's legal to grow here too but I

306.66 --> 309.97900000000004
don't have a place to grow it

313.08 --> 321.78
I I live a top story of a flat apartment

316.8 --> 323.94
building in one room I I don't have I

321.78 --> 326.82
could grow it but how the hell am I

323.94 --> 331.4
gonna try it then okay

326.82 --> 331.4
no there is just no chance to that

332.88 --> 335.539
foreign

340.259 --> 344.94
because it's the entire house is going

342.78 --> 348.0
to smell like it and it's not going to

344.94 --> 350.1
be uh yeah I mean landlord would never

348.0 --> 352.199
accept that

350.1 --> 355.02000000000004
right anyway

352.199 --> 357.539
but I have grown my own in the past that

355.02 --> 361.02
was great it was fun even I like doing

357.539 --> 362.58
it but yeah I can't do that here

361.02 --> 366.02
ah

362.58 --> 366.02
anyway it was a bit Wild

371.58 --> 376.74
but in a way it also kind of did freshen

374.16 --> 379.97900000000004
Me Up Just because of the intensity of

376.74 --> 381.90000000000003
it because it was real nightmares

379.979 --> 383.639
like waking nightmares where basically

381.9 --> 385.44
any thought that would come to my mind

383.639 --> 389.639
would be

385.44 --> 391.38
pain inducing any thought

389.639 --> 394.02
like especially if it was quick

391.38 --> 396.96
transition so I had a real difficulty

394.02 --> 397.979
trying to calm my mind to just like not

396.96 --> 401.419
think

397.979 --> 401.419
it's almost impossible

405.24 --> 413.46000000000004
bad spot anyway yeah so uh

409.919 --> 416.81899999999996
don't try two new things at the same

413.46 --> 420.25899999999996
time Arwin

416.819 --> 420.259
that's a bad idea

422.22 --> 425.22
right

427.199 --> 434.819
but uh yeah I feel better today

432.0 --> 437.94
although still like

434.819 --> 441.38
I can still feel like that cannabis and

437.94 --> 441.38
its influence in my system

442.259 --> 444.86
it's weird

447.12 --> 452.22
right anyway

449.4 --> 454.08
uh yeah man

452.22 --> 457.319
yesterday

454.08 --> 460.08
well despite despite being sick was it

457.319 --> 462.18
wasn't interesting evening flat so I had

460.08 --> 465.419
fight the Flat Earth on

462.18 --> 468.18
which was like hysterical

465.419 --> 470.21999999999997
it was so freaking funny it was it was

468.18 --> 473.06
just

470.22 --> 473.06
amazing

474.9 --> 478.21999999999997
did anybody catch that

480.72 --> 487.68
that was like very freaking funny to me

485.4 --> 489.31899999999996
it was so stuttery

487.68 --> 493.56
Craig

489.319 --> 496.86
in the end so rampussy and stuttery it

493.56 --> 501.319
was just really something to hold

496.86 --> 501.319
but yeah I mean flat side

501.78 --> 506.21999999999997
held in there for three hours it's

504.36 --> 508.56
pretty amazing

506.22 --> 511.52000000000004
I mean the guy has some patience

508.56 --> 511.52
it's pretty incredible

513.36 --> 519.0
should move to Spain yes of course

515.88 --> 521.659
moving oh yeah

519.0 --> 521.659
okay

529.08 --> 534.779
foreign

531.68 --> 540.12
yeah you know what isn't cheap

534.779 --> 540.12
do not do you not see moving

540.24 --> 542.899
huh

543.2 --> 548.88
especially to another country

546.779 --> 553.26
so

548.88 --> 556.8
yeah let's not do that it's not gonna be

553.26 --> 559.7
a short-term solution of any form so

556.8 --> 559.6999999999999
this is

561.0 --> 565.019
I mean yeah if I got a ton of money then

563.459 --> 568.92
yeah I could consider all kinds of

565.019 --> 573.12
options I don't though at all I'm in

568.92 --> 576.24
debt I can barely get by right now it's

573.12 --> 579.74
been like that for a while for like two

576.24 --> 579.74
months pretty much straight

584.67 --> 589.8199999999999
[Music]

587.339 --> 589.82
people

596.94 --> 603.1800000000001
but yeah I do like Spain I mean

599.88 --> 605.82
in my entire youth we went my family

603.18 --> 610.019
went to Spain

605.82 --> 612.12
on vacation so yeah I do know Spain I do

610.019 --> 617.0600000000001
appreciate the country

612.12 --> 617.0600000000001
I would even consider living there

617.64 --> 621.72
which is very rare because I don't

619.5 --> 623.82
really consider living anywhere except

621.72 --> 628.26
where I've always lived

623.82 --> 628.2600000000001
in my home country so

628.74 --> 633.38
but yeah that's not gonna happen anytime

631.08 --> 633.38
soon

635.58 --> 638.48
where's everybody

643.8 --> 647.18
I mean besides you

655.74 --> 660.74
I thought by the way that my Friday show

657.959 --> 660.7399999999999
was really good

662.339 --> 667.4590000000001
there was at least a lot of energy I had

664.38 --> 667.459
a lot of energy that day

673.2 --> 678.9590000000001
right and then Nathan had a baller on

676.079 --> 681.06
and that was hysterical

678.959 --> 683.7199999999999
it was like old-fashioned Flat Earth

681.06 --> 683.7199999999999
debates again

684.06 --> 689.64
and yesterday him flat side with Craig

686.399 --> 691.079
was also kind of old-fashioned Flat

689.64 --> 695.72
Earth Style

691.079 --> 695.7199999999999
just reminded me of all times good times

695.88 --> 699.56
guys where the hell is everybody

704.64 --> 709.909
uh

706.75 --> 709.909
[Music]

717.899 --> 721.82
hey Thor Casey good to see you man

728.279 --> 730.579
foreign

747.14 --> 751.8
like a spiritual reset and it's like

749.82 --> 755.0
super positive all of a sudden like

751.8 --> 755.0
really exhilarated

757.339 --> 763.2600000000001
what you're having a day so incredibly

760.019 --> 765.36
awesome it physically hurts okay

763.26 --> 767.1
people

765.36 --> 769.88
uh

767.1 --> 769.88
what

781.5 --> 785.399
I mean if it I get it

783.899 --> 787.62
I

785.399 --> 790.019
an incredibly awesome experience

787.62 --> 791.519
experience can almost like hurt

790.019 --> 793.44
the soul

791.519 --> 796.32
I've had that in the past where I was

793.44 --> 798.6
just like so ecstatic over like how I

796.32 --> 800.519
was and what I was doing

798.6 --> 803.1800000000001
and just what was happening

800.519 --> 803.18
hold on

818.82 --> 824.94
sorry

820.519 --> 826.74
YouTube is stalling I don't know still

824.94 --> 829.9200000000001
I don't know if it's stalling for you

826.74 --> 833.66
guys but it is for me very annoying

829.92 --> 833.66
but anyway I've had days

833.94 --> 838.7600000000001
where it was so Excel incredibly

836.1 --> 838.76
exhilarating

838.98 --> 843.899
that

840.42 --> 846.3
I would like it would like hurt my soul

843.899 --> 848.279
in a sense because I realized that there

846.3 --> 849.899
was only a moment

848.279 --> 852.24
and that

849.899 --> 854.1
probably wouldn't feel anything like

852.24 --> 856.139
that ever again

854.1 --> 859.0790000000001
right

856.139 --> 862.7
is it like that because it physically

859.079 --> 862.6999999999999
hurting seems kind of crazy

863.44 --> 866.599
[Music]

867.0 --> 870.0
oh

874.68 --> 877.2199999999999
oh

885.839 --> 892.22
yeah that's a really mixed bag then

888.54 --> 892.2199999999999
I get it that's weird

905.94 --> 908.12
thank you

911.22 --> 916.4590000000001
all right well I hope you still just

913.44 --> 916.4590000000001
managed to enjoy it

927.24 --> 929.72
right

934.68 --> 936.92
foreign

954.839 --> 958.9100000000001
so yeah I am going to actively take it

957.48 --> 959.94
easy now

958.91 --> 961.56
[Music]

959.94 --> 965.1
for myself

961.56 --> 967.3199999999999
because it's interesting Owen had like a

965.1 --> 969.9590000000001
whole internal

967.32 --> 974.279
reflection part that he laid down like

969.959 --> 977.4799999999999
on the Friday and even Saturday stream

974.279 --> 977.48
about how

977.88 --> 983.76
the importance of her yeah

981.06 --> 985.5
feeling good while you do something and

983.76 --> 988.26
that you are doing it because you enjoy

985.5 --> 990.66
it and not because you're like

988.26 --> 992.639
what no sound what are you talking about

990.66 --> 995.3389999999999
no sound

992.639 --> 998.0600000000001
there's definitely sound

995.339 --> 998.0600000000001

[Music]

1013.38 --> 1016.58
[Music]

1028.939 --> 1031.78
it's been a while

1033.64 --> 1038.959
UFO shootdowns

1036.62 --> 1041.1789999999999
what

1038.959 --> 1043.3600000000001
no I have no idea what you're talking

1041.179 --> 1043.3600000000001
about

1056.66 --> 1062.24
I've heard of course of the the balloon

1059.059 --> 1065.84
supposedly right but

1062.24 --> 1067.28
I don't know if any UFOs no I but I

1065.84 --> 1069.4599999999998
don't really keep track of that sort of

1067.28 --> 1069.46
stuff

1073.94 --> 1079.059
over Alaska

1076.22 --> 1079.059
okay

1081.99 --> 1085.19
[Music]

1092.24 --> 1095.299
well that they took a look at their

1093.86 --> 1098.4189999999999
wreckage

1095.299 --> 1101.1399999999999
oh a cylindrical thing what they shot

1098.419 --> 1101.14
down one of those

1102.2 --> 1106.52
huh

1103.82 --> 1108.86
this short one or this how the hell did

1106.52 --> 1112.28
they even do that

1108.86 --> 1115.6599999999999
how could they even pre predict the

1112.28 --> 1115.66
trajectory of such a thing

1119.539 --> 1122.86
very elaborate at all

1124.1 --> 1127.12
there's no photos

1128.66 --> 1133.24
yeah this could all be completely made

1131.0 --> 1133.24
up

1140.6 --> 1147.1599999999999
there's not a single photograph not a

1144.62 --> 1147.1599999999999
single one

1147.74 --> 1153.2
right I mean how hard is to take just

1150.08 --> 1155.72
one photograph of like the crash site

1153.2 --> 1157.82
where it crash down

1155.72 --> 1161.419
could even be at a distance so there's

1157.82 --> 1165.4399999999998
nothing you can find absolutely nothing

1161.419 --> 1167.24
so it could be completely made up like

1165.44 --> 1169.039
not happened things

1167.24 --> 1171.08
entirely

1169.039 --> 1173.84
yeah

1171.08 --> 1177.1999999999998
because if it was a real freaking UFO

1173.84 --> 1180.1999999999998
dude there would be certain reporters

1177.2 --> 1183.679
that would like a hop in a plane

1180.2 --> 1185.8600000000001
just to have a flyby photograph of it or

1183.679 --> 1185.8600000000001
something

1186.08 --> 1191.32
because it's a freaking UFO man I mean

1189.32 --> 1194.84
this is ridiculous there's no

1191.32 --> 1198.08
photographs of anything

1194.84 --> 1200.9189999999999
so far and I'm clicking I'm clicking

1198.08 --> 1200.9189999999999
through the articles

1209.6 --> 1215.1789999999999
start the start of the fake oh come on

1213.08 --> 1219.6789999999999
first start dude

1215.179 --> 1223.6000000000001
the fake alien agenda started in the

1219.679 --> 1223.6000000000001
freaking 9050s man

1223.76 --> 1228.919
this big head no they're not

1226.7 --> 1232.539
it's already started

1228.919 --> 1232.539
it's all nonsense

1237.98 --> 1242.48
hey Amanda young good to see you

1240.44 --> 1245.98
flatten the Curve

1242.48 --> 1245.98
and seeking star water of course

1255.86 --> 1259.3999999999999
right but it's kind of funny because you

1258.26 --> 1262.22
good point

1259.4 --> 1264.679
it might have actually been a balloon

1262.22 --> 1266.059
and they're just calling it a UFO and

1264.679 --> 1268.5800000000002
like not

1266.059 --> 1270.86
allowing footage of it

1268.58 --> 1272.6599999999999
so they might be shooting down spy

1270.86 --> 1275.4189999999999
balloons

1272.66 --> 1278.3600000000001
but they're just keeping it

1275.419 --> 1281.419
and pun intended under the radar

1278.36 --> 1285.2199999999998
as in like they're just giving it a

1281.419 --> 1285.22
cover story of stupid UFOs

1285.46 --> 1290.559
like they no longer want people to know

1288.5 --> 1293.299
that it's balloons

1290.559 --> 1296.84
it could be that

1293.299 --> 1301.28
whatever it is it doesn't have any

1296.84 --> 1303.6789999999999
photographs this entire item

1301.28 --> 1307.46
that I'm browsing through zero

1303.679 --> 1307.46
photographs zero

1309.98 --> 1315.52
remember the balloon thing yeah guess

1312.44 --> 1318.2
what that photograph everywhere

1315.52 --> 1320.48
everywhere the photograph everywhere

1318.2 --> 1324.799
everywhere yeah yeah

1320.48 --> 1328.58
UFO shut down oh guess what zero zero

1324.799 --> 1330.9189999999999
photographs could it be made up oh you

1328.58 --> 1333.5
think yeah

1330.919 --> 1335.7800000000002
totally made up

1333.5 --> 1338.0
I don't even have to dig any further

1335.78 --> 1341.539
it's just oh there's zero photographs

1338.0 --> 1344.539
well that means it's [ __ ] made up

1341.539 --> 1347.6
in some Smoky back room

1344.539 --> 1350.08
of the freaking CIA

1347.6 --> 1350.08
probably

1356.419 --> 1359.14
ah

1365.48 --> 1369.919
anyway yeah still thanks for bringing

1367.64 --> 1372.3400000000001
that to my attention but I mean that was

1369.919 --> 1375.0200000000002
diffused very easily

1372.34 --> 1378.1999999999998
I mean come on

1375.02 --> 1381.28
no photograph means made up that's

1378.2 --> 1381.28
pretty much what it means

1390.76 --> 1396.26
but who knows maybe they're gonna

1393.2 --> 1398.659
photograph it afterward oh that couldn't

1396.26 --> 1403.64
have been tampered with or

1398.659 --> 1407.659
some scenario rolled out right like oh

1403.64 --> 1410.24
debris oh this is really real like a

1407.659 --> 1413.24
real crash yes

1410.24 --> 1413.24
really

1414.08 --> 1419.299
right yeah that's why you need

1416.539 --> 1421.94
photographs like basically the same day

1419.299 --> 1423.799
as the incident if you don't then that

1421.94 --> 1426.44
means that they could be making up a

1423.799 --> 1429.1399999999999
[ __ ] story prepping the grounds for

1426.44 --> 1433.179
a fake crash site and then implant

1429.14 --> 1433.179
whatever narrative they want with that

1434.72 --> 1437.8600000000001
hello tiger bear

1441.98 --> 1444.88
[ __ ] ing

1462.88 --> 1468.0200000000002
man it is kind of cool even though it

1465.44 --> 1469.3600000000001
isn't it's not supposed to be cold

1468.02 --> 1470.22
it feels cold though

1469.36 --> 1471.799
[Music]

1470.22 --> 1474.08
[Applause]

1471.799 --> 1475.82
yeah it's 10 degrees Celsius

1474.08 --> 1479.78
oh also

1475.82 --> 1483.74
it is Sunday the 2012

1479.78 --> 1483.74
of February 2023

1486.94 --> 1493.94
isn't that like Valentine's Day

1491.12 --> 1496.9599999999998
all right it's 14th never mind

1493.94 --> 1496.96
in two days Tuesday

1497.0 --> 1500.76
right

1498.14 --> 1502.46
I never get the day to write for that

1500.76 --> 1504.32
[Music]

1502.46 --> 1506.5
I just know it's somewhere after my

1504.32 --> 1506.5
birthday

1507.38 --> 1509.98
thank you

1517.659 --> 1522.5800000000002
here's some hype what

1524.12 --> 1528.1589999999999
that's a broken link

1531.52 --> 1535.6
try again seeking star water

1550.46 --> 1553.48
or wait

1553.88 --> 1556.48
foreign

1556.659 --> 1562.3400000000001
the link did actually still work anyway

1559.159 --> 1566.6200000000001
thanks jacket

1562.34 --> 1566.62
oh a spy blue photo yeah I know that

1567.4 --> 1573.039
I mean the Spy balloon item that was out

1570.26 --> 1573.039
there very long

1581.96 --> 1586.88
but I mean it's even admitted I mean

1584.179 --> 1588.919
China has literally admitted it

1586.88 --> 1591.0200000000002
like this is our balloon oh please don't

1588.919 --> 1592.8200000000002
shoot it down and then you shut it down

1591.02 --> 1595.36
anyway

1592.82 --> 1595.36
so

1608.059 --> 1611.84
right so I guess some things are

1610.46 --> 1614.6200000000001
happening

1611.84 --> 1614.62
still

1622.76 --> 1629.779
this article now about how zelinski is

1625.82 --> 1631.76
apparently a giant cokehead

1629.779 --> 1633.919
that was weird

1631.76 --> 1636.58
I mean I'm not surprised or anything but

1633.919 --> 1636.5800000000002
it's still weird

1656.179 --> 1658.9
foreign

1662.51 --> 1665.6299999999999
[Music]

1669.43 --> 1672.499
[Music]

1674.179 --> 1680.38
right so I think we went through events

1676.82 --> 1680.3799999999999
rather quickly already

1681.76 --> 1685.12
20 minutes

1688.4 --> 1693.5
yeah by the way I I downloaded something

1691.94 --> 1697.039
I

1693.5 --> 1698.84
I didn't I didn't know because it's that

1697.039 --> 1701.6589999999999
it was already out there it was some

1698.84 --> 1703.58
Kickstarter from like 10 years ago or

1701.659 --> 1707.0200000000002
something

1703.58 --> 1707.02
called dungeon Alchemist

1707.659 --> 1712.22
and it's like an automated AI driven map

1710.96 --> 1716.539
maker

1712.22 --> 1718.1000000000001
which is really good looking and then I

1716.539 --> 1720.32
figured out wait I could download that

1718.1 --> 1723.559
and I can't like use it then because

1720.32 --> 1726.3799999999999
well it's downloaded

1723.559 --> 1728.4189999999999
could like use it in a professional

1726.38 --> 1730.94
capacity I would have to actually buy it

1728.419 --> 1733.4
but I can test it out and so I

1730.94 --> 1737.3600000000001
downloaded that I'm gonna test that out

1733.4 --> 1740.0590000000002
this afternoon really curious about it

1737.36 --> 1743.12
I mean it's now already way it's like

1740.059 --> 1746.12
already reached its peak development

1743.12 --> 1748.3999999999999
so all the updates have happened Etc and

1746.12 --> 1750.559
I'm I'm like really curious as to what

1748.4 --> 1754.7
this is and

1750.559 --> 1758.08
the system I could show you

1754.7 --> 1758.0800000000002
like a video

1758.179 --> 1762.8600000000001
because I had this link like in my

1760.539 --> 1766.48
bookmarks for ages

1762.86 --> 1766.4799999999998
and I thought hey let's click this

1773.6 --> 1777.34
but yeah there's a demo

1777.44 --> 1784.0
and I'll share that so you can see

1780.62 --> 1784.0
a little bit what it's like

1784.46 --> 1791.059
so it's basically a game map assistant

1787.659 --> 1793.7600000000002
for Dungeons and Dragons

1791.059 --> 1796.46
as yeah

1793.76 --> 1798.919
I'm really curious to to check it out

1796.46 --> 1802.24
because I could use this also

1798.919 --> 1802.24
like for gaming

1804.02 --> 1808.0
no not that one

1812.44 --> 1815.799
uh what

1824.539 --> 1827.44
let's see

1829.6 --> 1834.98
all right okay with maximize that or

1833.539 --> 1838.279
something

1834.98 --> 1840.679
oh pop out the video

1838.279 --> 1842.419
would that work

1840.679 --> 1844.3400000000001
that would actually be kind of

1842.419 --> 1847.179
convenient

1844.34 --> 1847.1789999999999
uh

1852.38 --> 1854.7990000000002
what

1858.38 --> 1863.98
just okay let's see if that works

1864.74 --> 1869.02
no

1866.24 --> 1869.02
goodie

1876.62 --> 1881.899
I can pop it out on my screen but I can

1879.08 --> 1885.4399999999998
then present that pop out I have to do

1881.899 --> 1886.6399999999999
it on the original page oh goody oh

1885.44 --> 1888.799
anyway

1886.64 --> 1892.539
I'm just gonna show you

1888.799 --> 1892.539
or what it looks like

1896.299 --> 1901.84
yeah that could work

1898.279 --> 1901.84
come on come on

1902.419 --> 1906.38
what

1904.22 --> 1909.279
it has a button for freaking maximize

1906.38 --> 1909.279
but it doesn't work

1909.32 --> 1916.279
damn it anyway uh

1913.159 --> 1919.46
right so it's just this is the you you

1916.279 --> 1921.98
could buy it on Steam right

1919.46 --> 1925.039
and just look at this

1921.98 --> 1928.88
it's so freaking quick

1925.039 --> 1931.1
and lots of detail

1928.88 --> 1933.5590000000002
and yeah you can literally just print it

1931.1 --> 1935.779
out too or you could literally yeah use

1933.559 --> 1937.1589999999999
it like this on a interactive computer

1935.779 --> 1940.64
screen

1937.159 --> 1944.0200000000002
very handy very quick

1940.64 --> 1944.0200000000002
and very beautiful

1952.52 --> 1958.059
again the link to you guys so you can

1955.279 --> 1958.059
check it up close

1962.84 --> 1965.02
foreign

1982.039 --> 1986.559
there's so many things you can do with

1983.899 --> 1986.559
this it's crazy

1987.679 --> 1992.38
it's gonna take a while just to figure

1989.72 --> 1992.38
it all out

1994.779 --> 1999.46
custom pictures it's hilarious

2002.679 --> 2006.96
but I mean seriously this is like

2007.0 --> 2012.46
high quality game

2009.82 --> 2014.74
Graphics high quality

2012.46 --> 2017.08
and you can just like

2014.74 --> 2020.34
quick it's basically like a an

2017.08 --> 2020.34
environment editor

2021.519 --> 2024.36
amazing

2028.059 --> 2030.6589999999999
foreign

2039.72 --> 2046.0
capabilities of having multiple floors

2043.539 --> 2048.94
and here it shows like oh a staircase

2046.0 --> 2051.639
see right there but

2048.94 --> 2054.7000000000003
it's never demonstrated to actually go

2051.639 --> 2057.659
up to a second floor or something so

2054.7 --> 2057.6589999999997
oh really

2063.46 --> 2068.2
right so anyway

2065.919 --> 2071.399
I was very

2068.2 --> 2071.399
impressed by that

2085.179 --> 2091.379
China has announced an object in their

2088.3 --> 2091.3790000000004
airspace yeah

2092.619 --> 2095.94
of course they have

2100.54 --> 2105.7599999999998
right I mean China's got to compete with

2103.66 --> 2109.42
their [ __ ] against Americans

2105.76 --> 2113.1400000000003
[ __ ] of course right it's a [ __ ]

2109.42 --> 2116.04
off who is the biggest bullshitter

2113.14 --> 2116.04
about space

2119.13 --> 2122.28
[Music]

2124.06 --> 2126.72
foreign

2128.16 --> 2133.7999999999997
boy good to see you

2130.839 --> 2133.7999999999997
you're getting rich

2139.01 --> 2142.929
[Music]

2150.099 --> 2155.8590000000004
oh by the way I've been looking around

2153.04 --> 2158.52
to basically confirm this whole hashtag

2155.859 --> 2158.52
situation

2163.96 --> 2170.2
yeah I've seen other people that if you

2167.5 --> 2173.2
just put three hashtags apparently in

2170.2 --> 2176.3799999999997
your description box you get those three

2173.2 --> 2178.66
hashtags so I could basically choose to

2176.38 --> 2181.3
well rearrange how I order my

2178.66 --> 2183.0989999999997
description box and just put three

2181.3 --> 2185.079
hashtags in

2183.099 --> 2188.7000000000003
for a video but I would like have to

2185.079 --> 2188.7000000000003
decide which hashtags

2190.42 --> 2193.839
and perhaps I could even edit it in

2192.52 --> 2197.28
afterward

2193.839 --> 2197.2799999999997
depending on what I talked about

2199.24 --> 2205.4199999999996
right because from this block of

2202.119 --> 2208.6600000000003
hashtags YouTube Just chooses tartaria

2205.42 --> 2211.359
Black Swan Freemasons every single time

2208.66 --> 2214.42
except for sometimes when I stream live

2211.359 --> 2217.06
because then it gives no hashtags or

2214.42 --> 2219.46
this one which it is currently having

2217.06 --> 2221.98
hashtag arewin hashtag flutters early

2219.46 --> 2224.2
bird hashtag Flat Earth but then later

2221.98 --> 2227.7400000000002
it always

2224.2 --> 2230.3199999999997
takes that away and then turns it into a

2227.74 --> 2232.4799999999996
hashtag darteria hashtag Black Swan

2230.32 --> 2234.2200000000003
hashtag Freemasons

2232.48 --> 2236.92
does it every time

2234.22 --> 2240.72
just check it out anyway hello or else

2236.92 --> 2240.7200000000003
rice good to see you

2247.96 --> 2250.7400000000002
a Rhys

2253.24 --> 2258.0989999999997
yeah Welsh Reese

2255.46 --> 2259.9
you're doing well yeah I'm okay I'm

2258.099 --> 2260.7400000000002
doing better today than yesterday at

2259.9 --> 2263.44
least

2260.74 --> 2268.0
yesterday it was messed up

2263.44 --> 2269.68
I felt really sick really bad

2268.0 --> 2271.48
for like

2269.68 --> 2275.339
well

2271.48 --> 2275.339
basically 12 hours straight

2278.619 --> 2283.42
nah it's not fair enough that eight

2280.78 --> 2286.78
hours straight and but the last four

2283.42 --> 2289.359
hours were still kind of wonky

2286.78 --> 2291.7000000000003
people were including Nature Boy

2289.359 --> 2295.06
yesterday I think saying hey hello

2291.7 --> 2299.02
Stevie traveler oh get on with fight the

2295.06 --> 2301.48
Flat Earth and flat side I'm like uh

2299.02 --> 2303.82
nope

2301.48 --> 2306.64
I might be enthusiastically chatting

2303.82 --> 2309.6400000000003
there in the chat but like I'm not gonna

2306.64 --> 2309.64
perform

2310.0 --> 2316.2
because I'll get sick still because I

2313.359 --> 2316.2
was still wonky

2316.42 --> 2322.359
I'm still slightly wonky though but it's

2319.9 --> 2324.2200000000003
it I know that by tomorrow I'll be just

2322.359 --> 2328.24
back to normal

2324.22 --> 2332.2799999999997
anyway hello Stevie traveler so

2328.24 --> 2332.2799999999997
finally people getting in here

2364.0 --> 2366.66
okay

2376.19 --> 2379.26
[Music]

2385.079 --> 2389.8590000000004
you wouldn't have known what hit him if

2387.94 --> 2393.099
you got on

2389.859 --> 2395.68
well he actually asked did you hear that

2393.099 --> 2400.7200000000003
that later Craig actually oh maybe Arwen

2395.68 --> 2402.52
wants to come on like uh okay Craig

2400.72 --> 2405.5789999999997
[Music]

2402.52 --> 2407.8
that was kind of weird

2405.579 --> 2410.38
but yeah no I was not in a condition to

2407.8 --> 2411.76
do that I mean doing it from Chad is a

2410.38 --> 2414.88
whole another world

2411.76 --> 2416.44
energy wise as like actually doing it on

2414.88 --> 2419.339
camera

2416.44 --> 2419.339
or invoice

2434.14 --> 2436.96
all right

2435.67 --> 2439.96
[Music]

2436.96 --> 2439.96
foreign

2440.68 --> 2446.2599999999998
[Music]

2442.9 --> 2448.839
besides I I would probably just go and

2446.26 --> 2451.2400000000002
kind of make it nathonian

2448.839 --> 2454.98
because the way he stutters and rumpuses

2451.24 --> 2454.9799999999996
like that gets on my nerves

2456.28 --> 2461.619
right and that's the fun thing about

2457.72 --> 2464.56
chat you can't get rumpus in the chat

2461.619 --> 2466.9
you can just say it and anybody that

2464.56 --> 2469.9
wants to can read it

2466.9 --> 2472.119
without like having to like push other

2469.9 --> 2474.52
stuff aside

2472.119 --> 2477.099
just to see it it's just like no you can

2474.52 --> 2478.72
just read it it cannot be rumpus if it's

2477.099 --> 2481.6600000000003
in the chat

2478.72 --> 2484.68
right that makes it a lot more pleasant

2481.66 --> 2484.68
in that sense

2484.78 --> 2491.26
because Craig was like rumpusing the

2488.56 --> 2495.0
hell out of the situation especially

2491.26 --> 2495.0
like the second half of the whole thing

2498.16 --> 2502.0789999999997
episode flats are dispatched with the

2501.099 --> 2505.8
liar

2502.079 --> 2505.8
dispatch the layer

2506.26 --> 2511.8590000000004
I mean

2508.72 --> 2515.0789999999997
he basically called him out on things

2511.859 --> 2518.2
like elevation angle situation the

2515.079 --> 2520.8390000000004
geometry refraction it was like a really

2518.2 --> 2523.18
deep dive into the details in many ways

2520.839 --> 2525.9
those very interesting stream and super

2523.18 --> 2525.8999999999996
entertaining

2526.3 --> 2531.76
but eventually like flats are just kind

2529.3 --> 2534.099
of like let him go and do his thing

2531.76 --> 2537.3390000000004
because he was going completely ape [ __ ]

2534.099 --> 2540.0
ballistic Drake was like really going

2537.339 --> 2540.0
nutty

2540.42 --> 2543.66
with it

2543.7 --> 2547.2
and mixing [ __ ] up

2551.079 --> 2556.48
he was like oh second law of

2553.24 --> 2560.02
Thermodynamics is only the closed system

2556.48 --> 2561.64
yes Craig yell yell it and rumpus

2560.02 --> 2563.32
everybody

2561.64 --> 2565.0
while we're trying to explain to you

2563.32 --> 2567.82
like that's really cute that you found

2565.0 --> 2570.4
that one little page is somewhere that

2567.82 --> 2571.96
says that [ __ ] but flat side has

2570.4 --> 2574.78
plenty of quotes

2571.96 --> 2578.68
an actual real world examples of how it

2574.78 --> 2581.5
is it right so you could just say okay

2578.68 --> 2584.52
the laws of thermodynamics or just

2581.5 --> 2587.859
thermodynamics thermodynamics dictates

2584.52 --> 2588.94
you can't have gas pressure next to a

2587.859 --> 2591.52
vacuum

2588.94 --> 2594.04
without a barrier to separate them

2591.52 --> 2596.8
yeah thermodynamics apparently Craig

2594.04 --> 2599.2599999999998
couldn't handle

2596.8 --> 2601.599
second law of Thermodynamics because he

2599.26 --> 2603.7000000000003
would insisted that it only counts on a

2601.599 --> 2606.28
closed system is only conceptual so he

2603.7 --> 2608.859
was basically nitpicking like no it's

2606.28 --> 2612.52
only conceptual oh Second Law stepper

2608.859 --> 2615.88
Dynamics is only conceptual is it oh yes

2612.52 --> 2618.52
so it isn't actually a law then a

2615.88 --> 2621.96
natural law it's only a natural law and

2618.52 --> 2626.079
the conceptual yeah no it isn't

2621.96 --> 2626.079
anti-flat Earth malarkey

2635.859 --> 2643.44
but yeah it was just it was very

2638.8 --> 2643.44
entertaining and very elaborate so

2644.07 --> 2647.1490000000003
[Music]

2655.359 --> 2661.48
you cannot truly test something to know

2658.78 --> 2665.0400000000004
it to be true without first giving full

2661.48 --> 2665.04
Credence to the opposite View

2665.079 --> 2667.8
no

2670.3 --> 2673.9
what no

2674.98 --> 2679.0
why would you give Credence to an

2676.9 --> 2680.76
opposite view if that opposite view is

2679.0 --> 2683.22
obviously

2680.76 --> 2686.2000000000003
unstable and

2683.22 --> 2688.1189999999997
incohesive why would you give that

2686.2 --> 2690.8799999999997
credence

2688.119 --> 2692.619
makes no sense I mean you could figure

2690.88 --> 2695.44
out the perspective from somebody

2692.619 --> 2697.96
believing that on your idea to maybe

2695.44 --> 2700.839
clarify some things that you didn't see

2697.96 --> 2702.339
from your perspective vantage point of

2700.839 --> 2704.68
approach

2702.339 --> 2709.06
but to give full Credence to the

2704.68 --> 2711.5989999999997
opposite view no no why the hell would

2709.06 --> 2711.599
you do that

2712.78 --> 2719.2000000000003
just understand how their reasoning you

2716.619 --> 2721.54
don't have to give it credence

2719.2 --> 2725.5789999999997
gas go down go boom boom yeah yeah he

2721.54 --> 2725.579
went there Craig went there he did

2726.099 --> 2731.319
and oh oh did he

2728.8 --> 2734.319
no wait there was somebody in the chat

2731.319 --> 2737.619
because there were some real

2734.319 --> 2739.839
Craig follower squirt boys that

2737.619 --> 2742.38
literally insisted that gas go down go

2739.839 --> 2742.38
boom boom

2742.96 --> 2746.819
did Craig go there as well I don't

2744.64 --> 2746.819
remember

2750.579 --> 2756.7000000000003
anyway it was very enjoyable

2753.7 --> 2756.7
foreign

2771.339 --> 2774.119
okay

2776.56 --> 2781.56
anyway hello classical homeopath good to

2779.319 --> 2781.56
see you

2788.64 --> 2795.46
right but Devil's Advocate I would

2791.68 --> 2798.0989999999997
change that saying slightly instead of

2795.46 --> 2800.319
giving full Credence to the opposite

2798.099 --> 2803.079
view I'd say

2800.319 --> 2805.7799999999997
consider

2803.079 --> 2808.3590000000004
the opposite View

2805.78 --> 2810.28
right give them consideration as in

2808.359 --> 2813.9
figure out what it is that they're

2810.28 --> 2813.9
actually thinking and claiming and why

2817.38 --> 2821.88
unless I am misinterpreting the word

2820.119 --> 2823.78
credence

2821.88 --> 2827.46
[Applause]

2823.78 --> 2827.46
it already means that

2827.74 --> 2831.7
we even accepting acceptance of

2830.079 --> 2833.92
something as true yeah exactly that's

2831.7 --> 2838.3799999999997
not what you should do at all

2833.92 --> 2838.38
but you should give it consideration

2838.599 --> 2843.52
right

2840.24 --> 2847.2599999999998
considering is basically figuring it out

2843.52 --> 2847.2599999999998
and trying to see how they think

2848.26 --> 2852.46
lighten it up a bit

2850.839 --> 2855.64
what

2852.46 --> 2857.319
I'm just taking it's here I'm just I'm

2855.64 --> 2861.2799999999997
if you're gonna

2857.319 --> 2863.74
go with a motto I am going to yeah

2861.28 --> 2865.7200000000003
correct a few things because it

2863.74 --> 2867.7
literally I just looked it up Credence

2865.72 --> 2869.5
right to give full Credence to the

2867.7 --> 2872.2599999999998
opposite View

2869.5 --> 2874.3
that is literally to believe it like why

2872.26 --> 2877.0
would you do that why would you do that

2874.3 --> 2880.48
why is that necessary to understand what

2877.0 --> 2882.94
you think is true

2880.48 --> 2885.579
why would you have to believe the

2882.94 --> 2888.339
opposite that makes no sense if you you

2885.579 --> 2890.26
should consider it and figure out what

2888.339 --> 2891.2799999999997
their objections train of thinking Etc

2890.26 --> 2894.94
is

2891.28 --> 2896.7400000000002
in order for them to disagree sure but

2894.94 --> 2900.96
that's not giving full Credence that's

2896.74 --> 2900.9599999999996
just considering their viewpoints

2906.0 --> 2911.7
hey Godzilla

2908.319 --> 2911.7
37 good to see you

2915.52 --> 2923.099
right it's not yeah but it's not about

2918.4 --> 2926.14
lighting it up it's about being correct

2923.099 --> 2929.339
meaning of words and all

2926.14 --> 2929.339
and the consequences

2932.8 --> 2938.6800000000003
right believing in something opposite

2936.52 --> 2940.78
does not help you understand your point

2938.68 --> 2943.0
better

2940.78 --> 2946.0600000000004
but

2943.0 --> 2949.599
figuring out the perspective of the

2946.06 --> 2952.2999999999997
opposite view might help you

2949.599 --> 2955.0
because it gives you another look unto

2952.3 --> 2958.619
you what you're thinking

2955.0 --> 2958.619
from an outside perspective

2959.44 --> 2964.14
that doesn't mean that you have to

2961.18 --> 2964.14
actually believe it

2965.859 --> 2973.42
because believing is quite like that is

2969.46 --> 2976.66
personal more per like you don't just

2973.42 --> 2979.0
believe things or shouldn't force

2976.66 --> 2982.859
yourself to do that at all

2979.0 --> 2982.859
anyway I think you get the point

2986.56 --> 2991.2999999999997
okay okay

2988.839 --> 2994.14
sorry for being just nitpicky

2991.3 --> 2994.1400000000003
about it

2998.14 --> 3001.6189999999997
there's nothing so hold fast to which is

3000.48 --> 3004.7400000000002
true yeah

3001.619 --> 3007.52
well that's just common sense isn't it

3004.74 --> 3007.52
Godzilla

3012.859 --> 3018.319
wow what's this

3015.78 --> 3018.3190000000004
oh yeah

3019.38 --> 3022.2200000000003
foreign

3030.42 --> 3035.599
about that

3032.88 --> 3035.599
uh

3039.839 --> 3044.66
it would seem yeah no of course no

3042.42 --> 3047.099
critical thinking is so yesterday

3044.66 --> 3050.0989999999997
Godzilla I mean

3047.099 --> 3052.7400000000002
it just listen to what they tell you is

3050.099 --> 3054.839
the truth now why would you need to

3052.74 --> 3057.359
learn how to critically think

3054.839 --> 3062.4
right

3057.359 --> 3064.68
I mean if it's on the TV it must be true

3062.4 --> 3066.599
and if a flat earther says it well then

3064.68 --> 3068.3999999999996
it must be wrong

3066.599 --> 3070.2000000000003
and

3068.4 --> 3072.54
if

3070.2 --> 3076.5589999999997
they're really rich well they must have

3072.54 --> 3077.819
worked really hard to get it yes

3076.559 --> 3081.119
just

3077.819 --> 3083.339
accept it

3081.119 --> 3086.04
don't think about whether it actually

3083.339 --> 3088.38
makes sense or not come on

3086.04 --> 3093.8
this is the 21st century

3088.38 --> 3093.8
critical thinking is so last millennium

3107.22 --> 3111.66
right but uh yeah I mean yeah I'm being

3109.92 --> 3113.819
sarcastic of course

3111.66 --> 3116.46
be really weird if you didn't get that

3113.819 --> 3118.8
part but uh

3116.46 --> 3121.46
yeah no critical thinking is well

3118.8 --> 3121.46
critical

3123.54 --> 3128.7
that is going to be even more so because

3126.66 --> 3131.5989999999997
every little corner of perception is

3128.7 --> 3131.5989999999997
going to be tested

3132.059 --> 3136.98
with manipulation like it's

3134.46 --> 3138.66
critical thinking is becoming more and

3136.98 --> 3140.04
more and more important than ever before

3138.66 --> 3142.6189999999997
because

3140.04 --> 3145.74
the system is going to become so refined

3142.619 --> 3147.8
in knowing what you believe in and how

3145.74 --> 3150.72
they can literally

3147.8 --> 3153.3
stare you through that belief

3150.72 --> 3155.7599999999998
make you do things that without that

3153.3 --> 3158.3390000000004
belief you would never do yeah

3155.76 --> 3161.5200000000004
the Beast system is becoming very

3158.339 --> 3162.839
proficient at that to steer you through

3161.52 --> 3165.48
your beliefs

3162.839 --> 3167.819
without you understanding what that what

3165.48 --> 3169.98
the consequences even are because you're

3167.819 --> 3172.02
just following your belief you think

3169.98 --> 3173.52
you're doing the right thing but you're

3172.02 --> 3174.78
not actually thinking you're just

3173.52 --> 3178.16
feeling

3174.78 --> 3178.1600000000003
just going with the feeling

3180.18 --> 3184.8799999999997
there's my title critical thinking is

3182.46 --> 3184.88
critical

3187.319 --> 3190.319
meh

3191.579 --> 3196.7400000000002
doesn't really ring great

3195.0 --> 3199.88
means

3196.74 --> 3199.8799999999997
something missing

3210.48 --> 3214.44
and my thoughts even no they don't know

3212.819 --> 3217.079
everything about your thoughts but they

3214.44 --> 3221.359
do know how typical thoughts roll out of

3217.079 --> 3221.3590000000004
considerations that they do know

3221.46 --> 3228.96
so they have templates that will

3225.48 --> 3231.0
give them like a good indication of how

3228.96 --> 3233.46
it would typically go but it's not

3231.0 --> 3236.7
really predictable though because as

3233.46 --> 3238.26
soon as somebody with critical thinking

3236.7 --> 3240.359
arrives

3238.26 --> 3241.98
then that whole system doesn't work

3240.359 --> 3244.68
anymore

3241.98 --> 3248.96
yeah it's one of the bigger issues is

3244.68 --> 3253.0789999999997
that yeah people are only predictable

3248.96 --> 3254.88
when they are just autopiloting then

3253.079 --> 3258.059
everything becomes predictable the ideas

3254.88 --> 3259.98
come become predictable what the

3258.059 --> 3261.42
responses to the ideas become really

3259.98 --> 3263.52
predictable

3261.42 --> 3267.9
but if somebody's a critical thinker

3263.52 --> 3270.599
then they will typically avoid

3267.9 --> 3275.2200000000003
just intuitively

3270.599 --> 3279.059
the standard autopilot responses

3275.22 --> 3281.359
because they know that it it makes no

3279.059 --> 3281.3590000000004
sense

3282.18 --> 3286.5
because they're critical thinkers I

3284.04 --> 3289.5
thought about it

3286.5 --> 3291.66
and so they don't fit the module anymore

3289.5 --> 3294.54
right I mean

3291.66 --> 3297.5989999999997
it predictability only works on

3294.54 --> 3300.66
autopilot in any form right I mean a

3297.599 --> 3303.599
Nutty conspiracy theorist

3300.66 --> 3306.1189999999997
is still predictable because a lot of it

3303.599 --> 3308.099
has to do with people that are stuck in

3306.119 --> 3309.48
their lives that are going on autopilot

3308.099 --> 3312.1800000000003
they're just going under like an

3309.48 --> 3314.819
oppositional autopilot to society but

3312.18 --> 3318.7799999999997
they're still Auto piloting a lot

3314.819 --> 3321.18
and so that still becomes predictable

3318.78 --> 3324.0
there are weaknesses towards society

3321.18 --> 3325.68
that they cannot really deal with also

3324.0 --> 3328.02
is predictable

3325.68 --> 3333.1189999999997
you see

3328.02 --> 3336.839
so only the people that are really like

3333.119 --> 3340.02
really in control over themselves

3336.839 --> 3343.02
and their interaction with society and

3340.02 --> 3346.819
critical thinking like those

3343.02 --> 3346.819
are not predictable at all

3349.319 --> 3354.9
but if you have some kind of a weakness

3351.48 --> 3358.38
or if it's weakness of the Mind weakness

3354.9 --> 3359.88
of the heart weakness of your social

3358.38 --> 3363.42
skills

3359.88 --> 3368.0
then that makes you more predictable you

3363.42 --> 3368.0
see weakness is very predictable

3370.14 --> 3373.16
think about it

3380.94 --> 3385.619
and strength is predictable in another

3384.359 --> 3390.119
way

3385.619 --> 3392.76
but strength that can be controlled

3390.119 --> 3394.92
is not predictable right because only

3392.76 --> 3396.6600000000003
strength that cannot be controlled like

3394.92 --> 3398.76
you have to throw it a lot well then it

3396.66 --> 3401.8799999999997
becomes predictable guess why because

3398.76 --> 3404.2200000000003
you're going on an autopilot you have to

3401.88 --> 3407.339
throw it out you have to manifest oh

3404.22 --> 3410.16
well then it becomes predictable but if

3407.339 --> 3412.68
you can have that strength and maintain

3410.16 --> 3414.66
it without necessarily having to throw

3412.68 --> 3417.319
it out then it becomes a lot more

3414.66 --> 3417.319
unpredictable

3419.88 --> 3425.28
right any of you just tell me when I

3423.0 --> 3427.619
stop making sense considering this

3425.28 --> 3430.5
because this is not based on looking

3427.619 --> 3433.52
[ __ ] up you know this is not based on

3430.5 --> 3437.819
math or the latest papers of some

3433.52 --> 3443.54
algorithmic research no this is me this

3437.819 --> 3443.54
is purely from my mind and my experience

3448.28 --> 3452.9390000000003
[Music]

3455.7 --> 3460.4399999999996
right

3457.859 --> 3462.359
but weakness is predictable

3460.44 --> 3464.9
and I think that would make even a

3462.359 --> 3464.9
better title

3472.61 --> 3477.049
[Music]

3485.88 --> 3489.7400000000002
yeah this is a good title

3490.02 --> 3494.27
weakness makes you statistically

3492.18 --> 3497.3089999999997
predictable and manageable

3494.27 --> 3497.309
[Applause]

3504.18 --> 3507.5
it's a pretty good title right

3509.94 --> 3514.339
anyway I gotta take to win a break I'll

3511.8 --> 3514.3390000000004
be right back

3528.42 --> 3530.839
foreign

3567.78 --> 3569.96
thank you

3590.22 --> 3593.22
foreign

3619.44 --> 3622.44
foreign

3626.48 --> 3630.98
I hope you guys are all enjoying the

3628.74 --> 3630.9799999999996
show

3631.079 --> 3635.6600000000003
if you are then Robin's it up already

3639.96 --> 3645.0
it's never bad to do that ahead of time

3642.359 --> 3646.44
a lot of people do tend to forget at the

3645.0 --> 3648.9
end of the show

3646.44 --> 3650.819
or they leave like somewhere before I

3648.9 --> 3653.94
round out the show so it would be much

3650.819 --> 3655.799
appreciated if he just rogans it up

3653.94 --> 3657.9
when you're

3655.799 --> 3660.2
when the show's still going that would

3657.9 --> 3660.2000000000003
be great

3686.96 --> 3693.299
right so anything else

3691.079 --> 3696.2000000000003
noteworthy

3693.299 --> 3696.2
I could talk about

3702.66 --> 3706.16
maybe some Flat Earth talk

3706.859 --> 3711.66
there's any Ballers out there or

3708.72 --> 3713.339
something if you got any questions or

3711.66 --> 3715.2599999999998
you want to hear me out how I see

3713.339 --> 3718.98
certain things I'd love to discuss

3715.26 --> 3721.26
flatter things a little more

3718.98 --> 3723.599
or maybe it's just not

3721.26 --> 3726.0
the good time slot maybe in the morning

3723.599 --> 3727.92
people just aren't really like want to

3726.0 --> 3730.74
get right into it

3727.92 --> 3733.44
except of course for Terror 306 who is

3730.74 --> 3736.8799999999997
for him it's evening so

3733.44 --> 3736.88
he's not here by the way but

3740.46 --> 3747.319
but I'd love to talk more about Flat

3742.559 --> 3747.3190000000004
Earth but I mean just me by myself

3749.04 --> 3751.52
yeah

3751.68 --> 3753.859
foreign

3763.64 --> 3769.339
can go down in the north it would still

3766.68 --> 3769.339
be a light out

3769.799 --> 3774.319
yeah didn't you know that tiger bear

3776.28 --> 3779.579
right that's the thing that I learned

3778.38 --> 3782.1600000000003
recently

3779.579 --> 3785.119
I that's I put it in the title the day

3782.16 --> 3785.1189999999997
that I figured it out

3785.299 --> 3791.339
that apparently

3788.04 --> 3793.319
north of the equator when sun comes up

3791.339 --> 3796.0789999999997
or goes down

3793.319 --> 3798.48
after it is visibly gone they're still

3796.079 --> 3801.48
light out I thought that was normal

3798.48 --> 3804.359
but apparently south of the Equator

3801.48 --> 3806.52
South you go the less that actually

3804.359 --> 3811.02
happened and it's like suddenly light as

3806.52 --> 3812.7599999999998
the sun comes comes up and suddenly dark

3811.02 --> 3814.799
when the Sun goes down I didn't even

3812.76 --> 3815.5200000000004
know that I didn't even know that was a

3814.799 --> 3817.74
thing

3815.52 --> 3819.839
that was a real baffling

3817.74 --> 3822.54
discovery

3819.839 --> 3825.5589999999997
it's like a week ago or two weeks ago

3822.54 --> 3825.5589999999997
something like that

3828.96 --> 3834.26
the equator is when Polaris is on the

3831.66 --> 3834.2599999999998
what

3836.52 --> 3843.5
no the equator is not when Polaris is on

3839.88 --> 3843.5
the equator that makes no sense

3844.559 --> 3851.48
the equator is based on the Sun

3848.52 --> 3851.48
Maxim

3855.24 --> 3861.0
I think that's basically what that is

3857.94 --> 3863.16
it's not based on the

3861.0 --> 3864.799
Polaris

3863.16 --> 3867.18
position

3864.799 --> 3869.48
I don't know what what do you mean e

3867.18 --> 3869.48
star

3877.98 --> 3880.64
what

3881.16 --> 3884.359
what are you talking about

3885.96 --> 3891.799
right oh wait you were correcting it

3889.14 --> 3891.799
never mind

3895.2 --> 3899.7599999999998
but no Polaris is not on the equator it

3898.2 --> 3902.46
is

3899.76 --> 3905.76
at the Horizon but that's weirder

3902.46 --> 3908.76
because if you go slightly south of the

3905.76 --> 3910.559
Equator you will still see Polaris

3908.76 --> 3913.619
right there's these you have the equator

3910.559 --> 3916.5
and then you have basically two bands a

3913.619 --> 3919.319
certain degree it's called they call it

3916.5 --> 3923.64
in degrees but

3919.319 --> 3926.04
so you can see Polaris slightly beyond

3923.64 --> 3930.359
the equator

3926.04 --> 3932.22
south of it so that is weird too I mean

3930.359 --> 3934.44
geometrically doesn't really make a lot

3932.22 --> 3937.74
of sense to me if you assume the Earth

3934.44 --> 3940.5
to be a sphere then that's happening

3937.74 --> 3942.77
Polaris is North yeah no [ __ ] I know

3940.5 --> 3946.0
that clearly

3942.77 --> 3946.0
[Music]

3947.579 --> 3952.2200000000003
yeah see on the horizon I thought that's

3949.619 --> 3952.2200000000003
what you meant

3953.819 --> 3956.42
foreign

3958.559 --> 3964.52
but the whole thing about the apparent

3961.079 --> 3968.28
celestial sphere is that it basically is

3964.52 --> 3970.7599999999998
above so there's like a the sphere is

3968.28 --> 3974.6400000000003
not like exactly in the middle

3970.76 --> 3978.1800000000003
apparently over this flat plane no it's

3974.64 --> 3980.96
slightly above it with a bit of curve

3978.18 --> 3984.66
down so that's why you can see

3980.96 --> 3987.66
Polaris and the Southern Cross

3984.66 --> 3988.92
roughly at the at in the middle of the

3987.66 --> 3990.96
Equator

3988.92 --> 3992.46
how the hell does that even make any

3990.96 --> 3995.359
kind of sense

3992.46 --> 3995.359
on the globe

3995.52 --> 4001.94
unless they are just assuming that it's

3999.0 --> 4006.039
actually a ball and that's why you can

4001.94 --> 4006.039
then still see those points but it

4006.26 --> 4008.92
now

4009.859 --> 4014.68
the celestial sphere just seems to be

4013.16 --> 4018.859
not

4014.68 --> 4020.7799999999997
exactly with its axis on Earth but

4018.859 --> 4022.7599999999998
slightly above somehow

4020.78 --> 4024.44
because otherwise how the hell would you

4022.76 --> 4027.1400000000003
see

4024.44 --> 4029.78
both sides of the apparent sphere why

4027.14 --> 4032.1189999999997
would you see both sides of the axis

4029.78 --> 4034.579
at the equator

4032.119 --> 4036.88
that's really weird it's always weirded

4034.579 --> 4036.88
me out

4044.18 --> 4049.0389999999998
and it went away when I was younger I

4046.28 --> 4051.2000000000003
was convinced as already mentioned that

4049.039 --> 4052.7000000000003
it is because the Earth is a ball and

4051.2 --> 4056.18
that's why

4052.7 --> 4058.2799999999997
then those that axis sticks up because

4056.18 --> 4060.6189999999997
it's actually curving down and that's

4058.28 --> 4062.8390000000004
why it's above the Horizon well yeah

4060.619 --> 4065.059
that makes absolutely no sense because

4062.839 --> 4067.22
it isn't curving at all

4065.059 --> 4072.02
it's all pretty damn flat so the

4067.22 --> 4077.2
apparent celestial sphere is seems

4072.02 --> 4077.2
slightly elevated above the horizon

4078.88 --> 4083.96
right

4080.839 --> 4087.64
the axial point of the celestial sphere

4083.96 --> 4087.64
is not at ground level

4093.339 --> 4098.839
foreign but yeah I mean who the apparent

4097.1 --> 4101.120000000001
axis

4098.839 --> 4103.04
when apparent geometry is not at ground

4101.12 --> 4106.16
level that well yeah it's apparent so

4103.04 --> 4108.46
but I mean that is the point I hope you

4106.16 --> 4108.46
get it

4123.259 --> 4128.44
why would there still be light out after

4125.48 --> 4128.44
the sun has set

4136.58 --> 4142.46
that's pretty mysterious isn't it

4139.339 --> 4144.92
I don't know I I can't even explain it

4142.46 --> 4148.64
like in my holographic model

4144.92 --> 4151.9400000000005
it's just apparently

4148.64 --> 4156.259
the celestials the light just it can

4151.94 --> 4159.259
technically like go below

4156.259 --> 4161.779
the apparent Horizon and still have

4159.259 --> 4163.64
light admitted from that angle even

4161.779 --> 4165.02
though it's literally from the ground

4163.64 --> 4167.54
then

4165.02 --> 4170.120000000001
right and it's holographic to me to me

4167.54 --> 4173.08
that's holographics because yeah the sun

4170.12 --> 4176.839
is not moving away into the distance

4173.08 --> 4179.239
nonsense physicality assumption bias

4176.839 --> 4182.719
is holographic

4179.239 --> 4184.459999999999
so my assumption had always been

4182.719 --> 4188.0
even before I knew that that didn't

4184.46 --> 4190.1
happen in the south of the Equator

4188.0 --> 4191.12
my assumption had been is like yeah the

4190.1 --> 4193.400000000001
angle

4191.12 --> 4196.16
of the sunlight

4193.4 --> 4199.82
is just like

4196.16 --> 4203.0
it's on that apparent sphere just going

4199.82 --> 4205.639999999999
below the Horizon and then you don't see

4203.0 --> 4208.04
the luminary anymore but apparently even

4205.64 --> 4210.860000000001
below the Horizon the persistent

4208.04 --> 4213.26
daylight still comes from that direction

4210.86 --> 4217.28
even though it's literally the sun is

4213.26 --> 4220.06
not there as a focal point to allegedly

4217.28 --> 4220.0599999999995
emit that

4221.96 --> 4227.38
and that's weird

4223.64 --> 4227.38
and I agree that's very weird

4230.48 --> 4234.44
and then Ballers will say oh but of

4232.76 --> 4236.96
course it's just because it's the

4234.44 --> 4238.699
geometry of Earth behind it's shining

4236.96 --> 4241.46
from behind the earth oh yeah that's

4238.699 --> 4244.4
cute man that's really cute

4241.46 --> 4247.34
so why doesn't that happen south of the

4244.4 --> 4250.759999999999
Equator mullers why doesn't it happen

4247.34 --> 4252.8
over there it's all a ball right it's

4250.76 --> 4256.900000000001
all a ball it's just a sun behind the

4252.8 --> 4262.04
ball right well why don't you have

4256.9 --> 4264.199
light after and before Sundown south of

4262.04 --> 4265.28
the Equator then and you do have it

4264.199 --> 4267.98
North

4265.28 --> 4269.78
how does that make any kind of sense on

4267.98 --> 4273.379999999999
your heliocentric model and I've never

4269.78 --> 4275.5599999999995
heard any baller ever whether they be a

4273.38 --> 4279.8
high tier Wizard or at the ground level

4275.56 --> 4282.52
numpty never even heard any of them ever

4279.8 --> 4285.320000000001
address it ever

4282.52 --> 4287.4800000000005
and that's how I was surprised to find

4285.32 --> 4289.099999999999
out just a few weeks ago because I never

4287.48 --> 4292.718999999999
heard of that before

4289.1 --> 4292.719
like what what

4294.8 --> 4302.1990000000005
is this how can that be

4297.92 --> 4302.1990000000005
and why did I never hear of that before

4306.86 --> 4313.9
the sun can set while in the sky no

4310.58 --> 4313.9
has nothing to do with that

4313.94 --> 4318.919999999999
it's not a physical object in a location

4315.98 --> 4321.139999999999
it's not going to be subjected to

4318.92 --> 4323.42
perspective because it's not an object

4321.14 --> 4327.1990000000005
in a location

4323.42 --> 4328.58
it's an angular Optical manifestation a

4327.199 --> 4331.5199999999995
hologram

4328.58 --> 4334.159
that follows you

4331.52 --> 4336.92
in at that distance

4334.159 --> 4340.4
you cannot approach it you cannot go

4336.92 --> 4341.96
away from its proximity it moves with

4340.4 --> 4344.48
you

4341.96 --> 4349.3
but the angle of it

4344.48 --> 4349.299999999999
its appearance towards you does change

4358.159 --> 4361.759999999999
didn't know since it were different

4359.9 --> 4364.239
what's the source of this I heard it

4361.76 --> 4364.2390000000005
through Brian

4370.1 --> 4375.56
but I mean

4372.8 --> 4377.3
I think flat side will confirm it he's

4375.56 --> 4379.34
south of the Equator and anybody in

4377.3 --> 4381.02
Australia could probably confirm it I

4379.34 --> 4383.62
mean we

4381.02 --> 4383.620000000001
talk

4383.78 --> 4390.58
it's not just English people and

4385.88 --> 4390.58
Americans and it's also Australians

4391.28 --> 4394.78
and some South Africans

4401.42 --> 4407.14
the sun can disappear without going

4404.12 --> 4407.14
below the horizon

4408.86 --> 4412.5199999999995
um

4410.48 --> 4414.94
no

4412.52 --> 4418.659000000001
no it doesn't

4414.94 --> 4418.659
that's nonsense

4425.239 --> 4429.759999999999
I mean you might not see that Horizon

4429.92 --> 4434.719
because it's kind of blurred up in

4432.98 --> 4437.239
everything right

4434.719 --> 4439.54
it's definitely gonna be below the

4437.239 --> 4439.54
horizon

4440.84 --> 4446.179
like it's gonna go away

4443.48 --> 4450.259999999999
because the angular resolution just

4446.179 --> 4453.14
stops it from being directly visible

4450.26 --> 4455.84
you could say

4453.14 --> 4458.179
but never just disappears unlike the

4455.84 --> 4460.9400000000005
Moon by the way which does exactly that

4458.179 --> 4464.0
or the moon never goes

4460.94 --> 4466.94
like below the horizon

4464.0 --> 4470.3
it's sort of like touches it and then it

4466.94 --> 4472.099999999999
just phases out entirely uniformly sin

4470.3 --> 4474.34
try to explain that in the heliocentric

4472.1 --> 4474.34
model

4478.46 --> 4485.56
Darkness Falls quicker near the equator

4482.42 --> 4485.56
so that the equator

4487.1 --> 4493.06
I thought it was south of the Equator

4489.86 --> 4493.0599999999995
not at the equator

4498.14 --> 4504.76
level agent so this is new to me

4501.62 --> 4504.76
what are you talking about

4507.14 --> 4511.820000000001
is there more sudden Darkness and Light

4509.36 --> 4513.799999999999
south of the Equator or is it at the

4511.82 --> 4515.78
Equator now I'm confused

4513.8 --> 4518.62
but yeah then again I don't even know

4515.78 --> 4518.62
who you are so

4520.219 --> 4523.719
could just be bullshitting

4524.42 --> 4526.9
cool

4539.78 --> 4543.58
sound is similar to the north

4546.199 --> 4548.98
is it

4568.82 --> 4575.179
so set quicker

4571.82 --> 4576.38
yeah fair enough

4575.179 --> 4580.04
but

4576.38 --> 4584.0
I had that experience to Welsh rice Rhys

4580.04 --> 4586.58
but how about south of the equator is it

4584.0 --> 4587.42
doesn't it just get more and more like

4586.58 --> 4589.84
this

4587.42 --> 4589.84
that

4591.56 --> 4596.360000000001
you wonder if you can be beneath Polaris

4594.199 --> 4599.36
yeah I don't know if you can

4596.36 --> 4602.32
might never be able to make it

4599.36 --> 4602.32
but who knows

4604.88 --> 4609.4400000000005
can never Beyond equal well okay I'm I

4607.1 --> 4614.120000000001
got this information through Brian

4609.44 --> 4617.839999999999
he says that's south of the Equator

4614.12 --> 4622.179
there is no morning glory and no evening

4617.84 --> 4622.179
light after the sun goes down

4622.52 --> 4627.56
but I don't know if that is actually

4624.56 --> 4630.9400000000005
true I just got that through him

4627.56 --> 4630.9400000000005
he says that's true

4633.86 --> 4639.339999999999
I never like got any kind of video about

4636.739 --> 4639.339999999999
it or anything

4639.679 --> 4643.96
that's not true is it wow

4658.3 --> 4665.12
that's really odd

4661.4 --> 4667.82
I had that literally in the title

4665.12 --> 4670.04
I've been talking about it the Flat

4667.82 --> 4672.799999999999
Earth debate also I guess that everybody

4670.04 --> 4677.199
[ __ ] ignored me then

4672.8 --> 4677.1990000000005
because they all just let it go

4682.76 --> 4688.52
right

4684.14 --> 4692.4400000000005
11 days ago daylight goes away after

4688.52 --> 4692.4400000000005
Sundown south of the Equator

4697.06 --> 4705.6990000000005
oh that doesn't make any [ __ ] sense

4700.04 --> 4705.699
then so thanks thanks for the tip

4705.8 --> 4708.8
fucksake

4714.8 --> 4720.400000000001
that's in

4717.14 --> 4720.400000000001
so yeah maybe

4727.28 --> 4731.12
it is kind of stupid though because I

4729.199 --> 4734.32
never actually

4731.12 --> 4734.32
like checked it

4734.9 --> 4740.12
I was just so baffled by him saying that

4738.02 --> 4742.820000000001
that I thought that that was like

4740.12 --> 4745.82
absolutely true

4742.82 --> 4749.42
and hey nobody here except you right now

4745.82 --> 4751.5199999999995
seems to give a fleeting [ __ ] what I'm

4749.42 --> 4755.0
saying and whether I'm correct or not

4751.52 --> 4757.96
because nobody corrected me

4755.0 --> 4757.96
nobody

4761.96 --> 4765.1
it was right there

4766.1 --> 4771.38
it's like not even trolls pointed out

4769.219 --> 4775.719
that it's wrong there's like nobody

4771.38 --> 4775.719
[ __ ] pointed out that it was wrong

4776.719 --> 4782.0
episode 1499.

4780.14 --> 4785.96
if that is wrong

4782.0 --> 4788.26
then why did nobody point out it was

4785.96 --> 4788.26
wrong

4793.1 --> 4798.38
Brian's not always correct yeah I know

4796.159 --> 4800.96
I know that by experience but with this

4798.38 --> 4803.78
one I I didn't think that it would be

4800.96 --> 4806.659
wrong it just

4803.78 --> 4811.36
I just assumed it I guess I guess I

4806.659 --> 4811.36
should never ever [ __ ] do that again

4837.199 --> 4842.379999999999
great

4839.3 --> 4842.38
[ __ ] great

4847.34 --> 4850.52
I guess I just need to stop listening to

4849.5 --> 4854.38
him

4850.52 --> 4854.38
because he just makes up [ __ ]

4866.6 --> 4870.4400000000005
maybe it's because he's freaking

4868.219 --> 4873.02
inaudible at times so that I just

4870.44 --> 4875.0599999999995
misinterpret what he says because I can

4873.02 --> 4877.159000000001
barely hear what he says even though he

4875.06 --> 4879.4400000000005
might repeat it like two or three times

4877.159 --> 4882.219
I can still not make out what what he's

4879.44 --> 4882.219
actually saying

4888.02 --> 4891.92
foreign

4889.46 --> 4895.179
get triggered when people point out

4891.92 --> 4895.179
errors no I don't

4895.28 --> 4900.0199999999995
I just get agitated with myself for

4898.219 --> 4904.58
being incorrect

4900.02 --> 4908.06
now baller numpty dip [ __ ] trolls with

4904.58 --> 4910.88
stupid [ __ ] sock accounts just saying

4908.06 --> 4913.159000000001
I'm wrong is not pointing out a mistake

4910.88 --> 4918.04
that's just you being a [ __ ] little

4913.159 --> 4920.719
[ __ ] [ __ ] at homing piece of [ __ ]

4918.04 --> 4923.06
can't leave anything alone

4920.719 --> 4925.58
yeah I don't need you to correct

4923.06 --> 4927.620000000001
anything you wouldn't correct it

4925.58 --> 4929.719
because you don't know [ __ ]

4927.62 --> 4934.04
you don't know anything to correct

4929.719 --> 4938.679
anything you're just a whining [ __ ]

4934.04 --> 4938.679
yeah talking about actual people

4939.679 --> 4944.7390000000005
whoa dank

4941.6 --> 4944.7390000000005
an actual person

4949.88 --> 4952.88
foreign

4983.14 --> 4988.780000000001
right so I guess that episode was wrong

4990.8 --> 4996.320000000001
great I always love having episodes

4993.14 --> 4998.54
where I'm just where the main subject is

4996.32 --> 5000.699
completely incorrect lovely especially

4998.54 --> 5005.64
if that's like two weeks ago and

5000.699 --> 5005.639999999999
literally nobody seems to give a [ __ ]

5005.739 --> 5012.699
you're just here to let me blabber on

5009.42 --> 5014.7390000000005
blabberon doesn't seem to matter what

5012.699 --> 5018.299999999999
the [ __ ] I'm saying because nobody ever

5014.739 --> 5018.299999999999
even checks what I'm saying

5019.659 --> 5025.0599999999995
but then again neither did I I didn't

5022.42 --> 5027.76
check what Brian was saying so that's me

5025.06 --> 5030.1
being stupid and you just being just as

5027.76 --> 5034.179
stupid as me

5030.1 --> 5037.179
in that and that includes Ballers that

5034.179 --> 5039.58
were just not even gonna check whether

5037.179 --> 5041.62
it is even true just to make fun of me

5039.58 --> 5044.98
about how it isn't true

5041.62 --> 5046.84
no they just want to whine why he

5044.98 --> 5049.36
doesn't know what he's talking about not

5046.84 --> 5050.56
actually correcting just whining whining

5049.36 --> 5053.5
whining

5050.56 --> 5055.84
whining in my comment section not

5053.5 --> 5058.44
actually correcting anything just

5055.84 --> 5058.4400000000005
whining

5063.159 --> 5070.239
yeah you'd correct something

5066.46 --> 5073.6
an actual correction not just whining

5070.239 --> 5077.139999999999
I'd leave your comment there don't you

5073.6 --> 5079.320000000001
understand you Dumpty [ __ ] I'd leave

5077.14 --> 5083.219
your comment there if it was actually

5079.32 --> 5083.219
relevant to anything

5085.44 --> 5093.099999999999
but no all you do is whine whine about

5090.06 --> 5096.580000000001
my personality

5093.1 --> 5099.159000000001
or how I handle my show that's all you

5096.58 --> 5102.34
whine about because you're a bunch of

5099.159 --> 5106.719
[ __ ] little [ __ ] that have nothing

5102.34 --> 5109.9800000000005
to offer the world but burden

5106.719 --> 5109.9800000000005
and nastiness

5114.94 --> 5117.599999999999
foreign

5121.83 --> 5131.3
[Music]

5138.179 --> 5144.64
yeah of course

5141.239 --> 5146.86
although there's not it are they always

5144.64 --> 5149.56
there I don't know are they like never

5146.86 --> 5152.679
ending storms I don't know if there are

5149.56 --> 5155.56
no at like the North Pole there is like

5152.679 --> 5158.02
periods of storm and then periods of

5155.56 --> 5160.54
clarity where isn't too much storm

5158.02 --> 5162.6990000000005
I don't know if that's in Antarctica as

5160.54 --> 5165.46
well or if it's like if at some point

5162.699 --> 5167.879999999999
there's just always a storm forever I

5165.46 --> 5167.88
don't know

5173.36 --> 5177.25
[Music]

5180.52 --> 5184.240000000001
oh talking about which I watched a whole

5182.86 --> 5186.46
bunch of movies recently

5184.24 --> 5188.32
[Music]

5186.46 --> 5190.179
gluing yesterday

5188.32 --> 5192.299999999999
there was one that really stood out to

5190.179 --> 5192.3
me

5193.3 --> 5198.900000000001
I actually wanted to talk about that

5195.219 --> 5198.9
yesterday but then I got really sick

5202.44 --> 5206.099999999999
what's it called again

5208.179 --> 5214.56
I posted it here somewhere damn it come

5211.659 --> 5214.5599999999995
on where is it

5226.02 --> 5231.360000000001
[ __ ] sake

5228.639 --> 5231.36
foreign

5240.28 --> 5245.32
what the [ __ ]

5242.56 --> 5249.900000000001
where is the damn link

5245.32 --> 5249.9
I linked it where the [ __ ] is it

5251.199 --> 5256.599999999999
oh wait I didn't post it right yeah

5254.56 --> 5259.3
against the eyes I watched a movie

5256.6 --> 5260.8
called against the ice and it was really

5259.3 --> 5264.46
interesting

5260.8 --> 5266.62
but Danish explorers of Greenland in the

5264.46 --> 5270.76
early 20th century

5266.62 --> 5273.94
as it was brutal in ways very rough

5270.76 --> 5276.1
but fascinating and and it's based off a

5273.94 --> 5277.839999999999
real story apparently

5276.1 --> 5280.659000000001
so I watched that and that was really

5277.84 --> 5283.860000000001
interesting to me

5280.659 --> 5283.86
very intense though

5285.76 --> 5291.1
I mean it's kind of [ __ ] up because

5287.5 --> 5293.86
yeah well they go there with slaying

5291.1 --> 5297.52
dogs and they literally like eat the

5293.86 --> 5299.679
dogs eventually and they feed dogs to

5297.52 --> 5303.820000000001
the dogs it's really [ __ ] up actually

5299.679 --> 5306.4
though but it's like yeah that's

5303.82 --> 5309.0
it's all about survival in just insane

5306.4 --> 5309.0
conditions

5315.28 --> 5319.62
hey blue pill Devolution good to see you

5320.98 --> 5327.419999999999
right so I watched that it's kind of

5323.5 --> 5327.42
grim but it's still a very good movie

5327.82 --> 5331.5599999999995
against the ice

5334.719 --> 5339.1
was another movie I also watched was

5336.94 --> 5341.199
very different

5339.1 --> 5344.400000000001
is it going because I don't even know

5341.199 --> 5348.219
the name damn it

5344.4 --> 5352.44
like I do not remember the name in the

5348.219 --> 5352.44
slightest I just know it was kind of a

5354.1 --> 5360.58
like a kind of a back alley Style

5358.239 --> 5363.0599999999995
private investigator movie but it was

5360.58 --> 5363.0599999999995
pretty good

5364.54 --> 5371.62
it was an interesting

5367.659 --> 5375.78
carefully written movie

5371.62 --> 5375.78
but I don't remember what it's called

5376.06 --> 5379.02
she

5397.659 --> 5404.44
did you hear that that was cute

5400.84 --> 5406.7390000000005
it's a Mac by making cute noise that was

5404.44 --> 5406.739
weird

5406.84 --> 5410.46
that's a sign of springtime

5413.28 --> 5417.599999999999
what the hell was that movie called

5427.12 --> 5431.34
yeah I'm not gonna find that one back

5431.679 --> 5436.62
I didn't don't even know the names of

5433.659 --> 5436.62
the actors or anything

5438.88 --> 5444.1
maybe I'll bump in it to dump into it

5442.6 --> 5446.92
one day again

5444.1 --> 5449.26
but yeah I absolutely have no idea what

5446.92 --> 5451.8
the name of that movie was so yeah can I

5449.26 --> 5451.8
help you with that

5454.54 --> 5460.659
it's really baffling how difficult

5457.62 --> 5462.34
Netflix actually makes it for you to

5460.659 --> 5463.299999999999
keep track of the movies that you

5462.34 --> 5465.76
watched

5463.3 --> 5468.76
it is really baffling that there isn't

5465.76 --> 5471.6990000000005
just a watch list

5468.76 --> 5473.38
just a list is just like yeah this is

5471.699 --> 5475.239
the movie that was watched then this is

5473.38 --> 5478.12
the movie that what what's done and that

5475.239 --> 5480.339999999999
that was then then so you just know like

5478.12 --> 5482.26
yeah this is what you watched no no it

5480.34 --> 5484.54
doesn't have that so oh you watch

5482.26 --> 5486.820000000001
something oh you forgot oh well that's

5484.54 --> 5489.239
too [ __ ] bad because you're not gonna

5486.82 --> 5492.46
find out what it is until you

5489.239 --> 5494.919999999999
accidentally scroll and recognize it

5492.46 --> 5498.82
yeah so good luck

5494.92 --> 5501.659
because we're not telling you

5498.82 --> 5501.659
uh

5503.8 --> 5510.52
and check out yeah I mean tiger bear

5507.28 --> 5513.34
it's a real I mean Owen Benjamin would

5510.52 --> 5517.0
love that movie because that movie is

5513.34 --> 5520.0
about serious serious Grit

5517.0 --> 5523.48
I mean serious great

5520.0 --> 5525.88
it's probably one of the manliest movies

5523.48 --> 5529.138999999999
I've ever seen

5525.88 --> 5531.58
by Owen Benjamin standards

5529.139 --> 5533.86
it's funny because they're the Danish

5531.58 --> 5535.36
and you know what Owen always says about

5533.86 --> 5539.4
the Danish

5535.36 --> 5539.4
so it's that's extra funny even

5541.42 --> 5547.06
you can see what you bought on Amazon

5543.46 --> 5549.219
yeah but that's because you bought it

5547.06 --> 5551.139
right and then there's a literal track

5549.219 --> 5553.06
record of a purchase

5551.139 --> 5554.9800000000005
on Netflix

5553.06 --> 5558.1
you can watch something and it doesn't

5554.98 --> 5561.218999999999
have like a watched list registry

5558.1 --> 5565.719
just really weird

5561.219 --> 5568.42
like it's it universally really weird to

5565.719 --> 5571.659
not have that because

5568.42 --> 5574.06
uh it's kind of Handy to keep track of

5571.659 --> 5576.82
what people have been watching like what

5574.06 --> 5579.42
you want your teenage kid to just dive

5576.82 --> 5583.12
into some really [ __ ] up disgusting

5579.42 --> 5585.159
[ __ ] [ __ ] that is apparently Allowed

5583.12 --> 5587.62
by Netflix to be watched by children and

5585.159 --> 5591.759999999999
then literally

5587.62 --> 5594.82
you can't even see that they watched it

5591.76 --> 5597.04
so people can just watch really [ __ ]

5594.82 --> 5598.0
up [ __ ] and keep it a secret from the

5597.04 --> 5599.98
rest

5598.0 --> 5603.719
that's ridiculous

5599.98 --> 5603.718999999999
that's absolutely ridiculous

5605.86 --> 5613.239
Netflix should

5607.8 --> 5616.4800000000005
absolutely have a basic thing a basic

5613.239 --> 5618.638999999999
list just one stupid button and a list

5616.48 --> 5620.5
that keeps track what has been watched

5618.639 --> 5623.139
maybe even

5620.5 --> 5625.239
the date right

5623.139 --> 5627.58
I mean that shouldn't be too hard to add

5625.239 --> 5629.86
on that on top of it but it would so be

5627.58 --> 5631.48
handy because you could literally like I

5629.86 --> 5633.699
watched something you don't even have to

5631.48 --> 5635.739
remember it you just go to Netflix click

5633.699 --> 5639.339999999999
Ah that's the name of what I want oh see

5635.739 --> 5642.699
that is it you no more issues done it's

5639.34 --> 5645.9400000000005
so basic it's so basic it might even be

5642.699 --> 5648.48
incredibly cheap to implement

5645.94 --> 5648.48
so

5653.02 --> 5658.96
you can see your viewing history on

5656.139 --> 5663.1
Netflix but you have to have access to

5658.96 --> 5665.32
access your account in what what does

5663.1 --> 5667.5
that mean

5665.32 --> 5667.5
foreign

5677.8 --> 5682.6
so you have to literally go into the

5680.08 --> 5686.98
control [ __ ] just to watch what you

5682.6 --> 5686.9800000000005
viewed that's [ __ ]

5689.44 --> 5692.44
why

5694.06 --> 5697.900000000001
yeah it's not my Netflix account so I

5696.52 --> 5701.5
can't actually do that I'm not gonna

5697.9 --> 5703.839999999999
[ __ ] around in in that

5701.5 --> 5707.26
anyway thanks for letting me know steamy

5703.84 --> 5710.4400000000005
traveler but why why would you have to

5707.26 --> 5714.06
do all that just to check what you watch

5710.44 --> 5714.0599999999995
that's ridiculous

5731.82 --> 5739.84
you actually have to like Google

5735.719 --> 5742.2390000000005
some Forum instruction

5739.84 --> 5744.159000000001
all right it is in Netflix and Netflix

5742.239 --> 5747.9
Help Center wow

5744.159 --> 5750.46
so there's a help center

5747.9 --> 5754.138999999999
notification of it but there isn't just

5750.46 --> 5754.139
a freaking slide button

5757.3 --> 5761.34
I guess Netflix just doesn't give a [ __ ]

5771.4 --> 5774.78
right we'll have to wanna

5775.239 --> 5781.9
be better than freaking get a history

5778.62 --> 5785.139
scroll thing I mean you have a search

5781.9 --> 5786.46
bar is put a history bar right next to

5785.139 --> 5789.9400000000005
it done

5786.46 --> 5792.219
so basic it's just like you click on it

5789.94 --> 5795.04
roll out you could scroll with it

5792.219 --> 5798.159
perhaps and that's it oh my God so much

5795.04 --> 5802.239
effort look at the convenience that that

5798.159 --> 5804.879999999999
would give incredible convenience

5802.239 --> 5807.099999999999
and isn't that what Netflix is all about

5804.88 --> 5809.92
the convenience right it's also smooth

5807.1 --> 5811.179
and convenient well do it get it in you

5809.92 --> 5812.639
idiots

5811.179 --> 5816.6
foreign

5812.639 --> 5816.6
what the hell are you waiting for

5817.37 --> 5820.479
[Music]

5823.239 --> 5825.9
anyway

5827.08 --> 5832.139
oh wow

5829.12 --> 5832.139
time has flown

5833.92 --> 5837.36
and was reaching the end of the show

5837.639 --> 5840.639
right anyway I hope you guys are

5839.26 --> 5843.780000000001
enjoying it

5840.639 --> 5843.78
thought it was interesting

5848.08 --> 5853.239
uh

5849.76 --> 5856.6
I am certainly annoyed

5853.239 --> 5859.12
by the realization four more hours yeah

5856.6 --> 5860.56
not without a PayPal that I'm not

5859.12 --> 5862.84
promising that because I'm not gonna do

5860.56 --> 5865.3
four more hours no way

5862.84 --> 5868.360000000001
but uh

5865.3 --> 5870.84
maybe incentivized to go on a little

5868.36 --> 5870.839999999999
longer

5872.92 --> 5876.58
or hey if a great conversation rolls out

5875.38 --> 5881.58
then

5876.58 --> 5881.58
then I'll go on longer anyway right

5884.199 --> 5890.759999999999
all right but apparently

5886.48 --> 5890.759999999999
I was mistaken about the whole

5892.36 --> 5898.299999999999
light after Sundown or before some down

5896.139 --> 5900.52
south of the Equator even though I had

5898.3 --> 5904.6
that entire episode titled that like

5900.52 --> 5906.639
that with zero comments saying hey Arwin

5904.6 --> 5907.84
you're wrong about that did you even

5906.639 --> 5910.54
check

5907.84 --> 5914.5
I mean what a missed troll opportunity

5910.54 --> 5915.76
you trolls are so [ __ ] lame and lazy

5914.5 --> 5919.3
as [ __ ]

5915.76 --> 5921.639
that you can't even pick up on an error

5919.3 --> 5926.7390000000005
to shove it in my face like that you

5921.639 --> 5931.6
guys are [ __ ] losers you suck you

5926.739 --> 5934.599999999999
suck as trolls you suck you suck you

5931.6 --> 5937.02
can't even pick up on a mistake that I

5934.6 --> 5940.780000000001
made in the title

5937.02 --> 5942.040000000001
for almost two weeks that's how much you

5940.78 --> 5944.98
suck

5942.04 --> 5947.08
you can't even pick up on an error I

5944.98 --> 5952.379999999999
made to shove it in my face that's how

5947.08 --> 5952.38
[ __ ] useless you are trolls

5960.42 --> 5965.08
[Music]

5962.8 --> 5968.8
no I don't ban people that correct me I

5965.08 --> 5971.0199999999995
ban people that talk absolute [ __ ] [ __ ]

5968.8 --> 5972.28
or that go at homing

5971.02 --> 5974.9800000000005
[Music]

5972.28 --> 5977.08

5974.98 --> 5979.959999999999
quickly retract their messages yeah yes

5977.08 --> 5980.86

5979.96 --> 5983.44
of [ __ ]

5980.86 --> 5985.9
immediately banned because I do not

5983.44 --> 5988.44
tolerate that ever

5985.9 --> 5988.44
yeah

5988.48 --> 5991.919999999999
yeah why don't you do that again

6001.199 --> 6004.5199999999995
stupid ass wipe

6004.679 --> 6009.54
I'm talking about a subject about Earth

6007.38 --> 6011.04
and phenomenon

6009.54 --> 6013.88
about it right

6011.04 --> 6017.28
sunlight daylight night time all that

6013.88 --> 6023.78
and it's been there

6017.28 --> 6023.78
for literally 10 days 10 days

6023.84 --> 6030.2390000000005
zero zero comments about zero

6027.78 --> 6033.42
Corrections you had all that opportunity

6030.239 --> 6035.638999999999
to correct me and to show how I made a

6033.42 --> 6037.219
whole show dedicated to something that

6035.639 --> 6040.62
was wrong

6037.219 --> 6044.28
nobody even spotted it because you're

6040.62 --> 6048.599999999999
that [ __ ] stupid yeah

6044.28 --> 6051.3
you spend all day every day trying to

6048.6 --> 6054.2390000000005
figure out how you can make me look

6051.3 --> 6057.12
stupid or annoy me or get in my face

6054.239 --> 6060.78
about it right make me feel bad and for

6057.12 --> 6064.139
10 straight days not a single soul has

6060.78 --> 6068.28
even spotted that it was wrong

6064.139 --> 6069.6
that's how [ __ ] useless you Critters

6068.28 --> 6071.88
are

6069.6 --> 6074.76
useless

6071.88 --> 6077.6
you have no more faculties to use to

6074.76 --> 6077.6
criticize with

6077.76 --> 6080.179
people

6083.84 --> 6088.08
Corrections never welcome yeah but there

6085.98 --> 6089.459999999999

see what did you correct level agent

6094.32 --> 6099.54
quickly what what have you corrected

6096.659 --> 6103.98
with yours you're saying this

6099.54 --> 6106.8
you're just whining you don't correct

6103.98 --> 6109.86

6106.8 --> 6111.38
and being wrong

6109.86 --> 6114.299999999999

6111.38 --> 6118.58
Corrections are always welcome

6114.3 --> 6122.34
whining gamma bitching is not welcome

6118.58 --> 6125.219
especially is if it is about how I do my

6122.34 --> 6129.4800000000005
show and not actually about any argument

6125.219 --> 6131.76
or in content response yeah

6129.48 --> 6135.959999999999
that's not a correction that's just

6131.76 --> 6137.88
gamma whining and bitching and I kick

6135.96 --> 6140.219
them out

6137.88 --> 6145.52
because there isn't any content there

6140.219 --> 6145.52
isn't even a response it's just whining

6154.32 --> 6160.86
oh yeah thanks level agent oh you're

6196.08 --> 6201.84
yeah but you didn't pick up on anything

6198.9 --> 6205.199
in the last 10 days did you

6201.84 --> 6209.58
so it's just a bunch of whining [ __ ]

6205.199 --> 6212.94
afterward talk again right troll

6209.58 --> 6214.58
stupid use a little scumbag huh

6212.94 --> 6218.759999999999
useless

6214.58 --> 6222.179
no perceptions no Acumen no critical

6218.76 --> 6225.06
thought just whining bitching and

6222.179 --> 6228.78
afterward talk after I literally had to

6225.06 --> 6231.179
correct myself for you

6228.78 --> 6234.659
now we are going oh you should have just

6231.179 --> 6234.659

6269.04 --> 6273.659

6271.08 --> 6274.98
right there yeah I'm leaving it right

6273.659 --> 6277.259999999999
there

6274.98 --> 6280.08
because I want to see

6277.26 --> 6284.659000000001
I want people to see

6280.08 --> 6289.32
what it is what you are what you do

6284.659 --> 6291.54
whining bitching afterward complaining

6289.32 --> 6293.88
you're a loser

6291.54 --> 6297.9
okay

6293.88 --> 6300.900000000001
you don't pick up on blatant errors for

6297.9 --> 6303.9
10 days straight even though you're

6300.9 --> 6305.94
supposedly out to get me and to correct

6303.9 --> 6308.94
this dumb flat earther you didn't pick

6305.94 --> 6312.96
up for it on 10 days I had to literally

6308.94 --> 6315.48
pick it up myself and then overtly make

6312.96 --> 6317.76
it into an item on today's show before

6315.48 --> 6320.4
you picked up on it your [ __ ] little

6317.76 --> 6322.9400000000005
[ __ ]

6320.4 --> 6322.94
practice

6332.9 --> 6337.04
was it him that said that

6339.84 --> 6343.1
no I don't think so

6345.42 --> 6348.679
let me scroll back

6353.219 --> 6358.1
maybe you're right maybe it wasn't I

6355.5 --> 6358.1
don't think so

6360.719 --> 6364.159
because we're thinking

6373.32 --> 6378.9
oh [ __ ] yeah it was him okay okay that's

6377.04 --> 6381.3
stupid then all right you were the one

6378.9 --> 6383.46
pointing it out

6381.3 --> 6386.46
right but you're still 10 days late

6383.46 --> 6390.0
though and nobody else out there pointed

6386.46 --> 6392.34
out okay so I take it back

6390.0 --> 6394.32
although yeah what I just was saying is

6392.34 --> 6397.679
a more generalized statement

6394.32 --> 6399.42
not against level agent specifically who

6397.679 --> 6401.78
was actually the one pointing it out

6399.42 --> 6401.78
earlier

6413.58 --> 6421.04
be more grateful for assistance

6418.02 --> 6425.2390000000005
what do you mean a bunch of bullshitters

6421.04 --> 6425.239
how do you call that assistance

6429.36 --> 6434.339999999999
I mean yeah I'm kind of I'm thankful to

6431.82 --> 6436.32
level agent

6434.34 --> 6439.46
for pointing that out even though it's

6436.32 --> 6439.46
10 days afterward

6439.86 --> 6448.86
sure but I mean maybe level agent is

6443.58 --> 6451.5599999999995
actually just just trying to be genuine

6448.86 --> 6454.5599999999995
but yeah I mean how many pieces of [ __ ]

6451.56 --> 6457.159000000001
trolls that I have to ban surrounding

6454.56 --> 6457.159000000001
that yeah

6457.739 --> 6462.599999999999
because I deal with those people too and

6460.8 --> 6464.159000000001
that's really who I was addressing all

6462.6 --> 6467.04
those [ __ ] that just whining

6464.159 --> 6468.96
complained about my format never about

6467.04 --> 6471.38
the arguments that didn't even pick up

6468.96 --> 6471.38
on anything

6472.619 --> 6476.639
maybe people don't watch every day well

6474.659 --> 6478.5
there's some people that definitely

6476.639 --> 6481.32
watch every day

6478.5 --> 6482.46
because they're constantly whining in my

6481.32 --> 6485.099999999999
chat

6482.46 --> 6488.1
and it's I'm kind of lucky if one day

6485.1 --> 6491.6
they don't troll this like troll my chat

6488.1 --> 6491.6
and start whining about things

6491.82 --> 6496.92
because it happens most days

6494.76 --> 6498.780000000001
but those people don't pick up on

6496.92 --> 6500.219
anything they're just there to whine and

6498.78 --> 6502.5
complain

6500.219 --> 6505.679
so it's just complaining and complaining

6502.5 --> 6508.199
about the complaining and now it's the

6505.679 --> 6512.04
whole thing oh we're just going to

6508.199 --> 6515.099999999999
complain about how you ban people and

6512.04 --> 6517.26
that's all we'll ever say it's just

6515.1 --> 6519.84
whining complaining about me Banning

6517.26 --> 6523.92
people that whine and complain about me

6519.84 --> 6526.9800000000005
Banning people yeah oh [ __ ] you

6523.92 --> 6528.42
okay [ __ ] you and you're whining and

6526.98 --> 6530.339999999999
complaining

6528.42 --> 6532.38
why'd you have a [ __ ] point in life

6530.34 --> 6535.02
why don't you have a [ __ ] point here

6532.38 --> 6537.54
in my chat instead of whining and

6535.02 --> 6538.679
complaining about me Banning people in

6537.54 --> 6542.699
chat

6538.679 --> 6545.159
that only wine and complain about me

6542.699 --> 6549.5599999999995
Banning people in chat

6545.159 --> 6549.5599999999995
yeah but you go [ __ ] yourself then

6555.78 --> 6560.599999999999
my chat is not a free for all

6564.0 --> 6571.46
my chat is mine it's not yours

6568.739 --> 6571.459999999999
you understand

6594.139 --> 6600.3
insulting people is not very clever well

6597.36 --> 6602.58
what versus just not never insulting

6600.3 --> 6606.0
people just letting people be complete

6602.58 --> 6608.28
[ __ ] [ __ ] and then just letting

6606.0 --> 6610.44
that happen oh that's a sign of

6608.28 --> 6612.9
intelligence is it

6610.44 --> 6614.82
letting retards around without any

6612.9 --> 6617.04
consequence

6614.82 --> 6620.36
that literally just

6617.04 --> 6620.36
ruin [ __ ]

6620.699 --> 6624.9
is that the smart thing to do to just

6622.92 --> 6628.04
let them do that

6624.9 --> 6628.04
huh is it

6644.94 --> 6649.678999999999
yeah I'm even leaving your shitty ass

6647.4 --> 6652.0199999999995
out here in the chat for people to read

6649.679 --> 6654.9
Because occasionally I want people to

6652.02 --> 6658.38
see what kind of gamma pieces of [ __ ]

6654.9 --> 6660.299999999999
keep whining in my chat

6658.38 --> 6662.54
you have to see it sometimes to believe

6660.3 --> 6662.54
it

6662.94 --> 6668.099999999999
right so you can see it right there

6666.719 --> 6669.659
on screen

6668.1 --> 6672.4400000000005
yeah

6669.659 --> 6672.44
that's real

6672.48 --> 6680.099999999999
people whining

6675.3 --> 6680.1
whining whining whining Non-Stop

6684.08 --> 6689.78
right but anyway I will not make that

6687.179 --> 6689.78
mistake again

6690.78 --> 6697.98
I guess that the

6693.659 --> 6701.699
short or quick some uh this the daylight

6697.98 --> 6704.879999999999
going away quickly after Sundown is an

6701.699 --> 6706.739
equator thing and not Regional ways it's

6704.88 --> 6709.38
not south of the Equator it's at the

6706.739 --> 6712.259999999999
equator itself

6709.38 --> 6716.28
right and which absolutely by the way

6712.26 --> 6719.9400000000005
has no implications on anything except

6716.28 --> 6722.159
that it apparently works that way

6719.94 --> 6724.86
so

6722.159 --> 6727.379999999999
not that the other the conception of

6724.86 --> 6731.0
that it would be like that all south of

6727.38 --> 6731.0
the Equator had any implications

6731.4 --> 6735.259999999999
ask flat side about sunsets

6737.34 --> 6740.06
why

6751.92 --> 6754.92
foreign

6757.639 --> 6763.9400000000005
I know that why should I ask him

6761.4 --> 6763.94
why

6769.26 --> 6772.219
what's the point

6772.56 --> 6780.0
it's just a factoid there's no argument

6775.86 --> 6782.94
out of it anyway either way

6780.0 --> 6785.46
it was just a factoid

6782.94 --> 6787.799999999999
that kind of weirded me out and Yeah

6785.46 --> 6790.34
well

6787.8 --> 6790.34
that's it

6795.48 --> 6801.32
to get a flat Earth what the [ __ ] are

6797.94 --> 6801.32
you talking about trust

6813.06 --> 6817.320000000001
since that's in Australia they seemed

6815.52 --> 6819.679
quick when I was there yeah that's what

6817.32 --> 6819.679
I heard

6819.96 --> 6826.58
that's exactly what

6822.78 --> 6826.58
Brian was basically saying

6828.96 --> 6833.34
so maybe there needs to be some bigger

6831.179 --> 6835.8
digging into this and maybe level agents

6833.34 --> 6838.679
just talking out of his ass

6835.8 --> 6841.400000000001
maybe it's completely just wrong I don't

6838.679 --> 6841.4
know at this point

6844.92 --> 6849.5
the level agent seems kind of like a

6846.96 --> 6849.5
troll anyway

6849.659 --> 6853.219
it's a very fresh account

6855.719 --> 6862.46
but yeah sure I guess I'll ask uh flat

6860.1 --> 6862.46
so I

6862.56 --> 6867.360000000001
the next time he's streaming maybe get

6865.02 --> 6870.3
on the panel and make that like ask

6867.36 --> 6871.92
about that item specifically to get it

6870.3 --> 6875.78
out of the way because this is all

6871.92 --> 6875.78
getting kind of confusing now to me

6894.719 --> 6897.56
okay

6898.86 --> 6901.58
right

6919.739 --> 6924.599999999999
okay well cool

6922.619 --> 6927.0199999999995
we'll figure it out I guess I'll have to

6924.6 --> 6927.02
ask him

6927.78 --> 6931.94
maybe I'll just ask him over Skype

6932.699 --> 6938.0
I'll actually do that right now so I

6934.56 --> 6938.0
don't have to wait on like a stream

Googling certainly won't no I know I

7055.34 --> 7059.4800000000005
mean Google will tell you oh there's a

7057.139 --> 7062.54
24-hour sun in Antarctica even though

7059.48 --> 7064.58
that's obviously edited so yeah I'm not

7062.54 --> 7066.32
trusting Google on it at all

7064.58 --> 7069.8
but flat so it's there and he's already

7066.32 --> 7072.099
responding to my Skype message so let's

7069.8 --> 7072.099

okay

7211.82 --> 7219.5199999999995

right well flat swords confirming it so

7345.38 --> 7351.82
yeah Brian's logic was just wrong

7348.56 --> 7351.820000000001
he was just wrong

7360.739 --> 7363.759999999999
what's his name

7369.92 --> 7376.119
level agent was correct

7372.98 --> 7376.119
it was just correct

7395.33 --> 7398.369
[Music]

7422.239 --> 7426.0199999999995
right I think I'm gonna round out the

7423.98 --> 7427.759999999999
show though I've been going over two

7426.02 --> 7430.6990000000005
hours already

7427.76 --> 7435.099
some mixed results but I mean it's

7430.699 --> 7435.098999999999
always good to figure out an error

7437.179 --> 7442.099
just goes to show I should really do

7439.639 --> 7445.06
something about just checking things

7442.099 --> 7445.06
more

7445.58 --> 7450.92
I basically take things for granted too

7448.58 --> 7453.08
easily

7450.92 --> 7456.02
because I think it's a trusted source

7453.08 --> 7458.96
and that's a a bad mistake

7456.02 --> 7461.780000000001
it is it is a bad mistake it makes me

7458.96 --> 7465.199
look really [ __ ] stupid and I cannot

7461.78 --> 7468.5599999999995
blame anybody but myself for it

7465.199 --> 7473.44
although yeah I mean it's been there for

7468.56 --> 7473.4400000000005
10 days and nobody picked up on it so

7473.54 --> 7479.78
that's also a big sign on the wall

7477.44 --> 7483.94
especially concerning trolls who should

7479.78 --> 7483.94
be on to that [ __ ] Non-Stop

7484.58 --> 7489.199
but they're not they're just complaining

7486.44 --> 7491.719
about how I run my show that seems to be

7489.199 --> 7493.5199999999995
what they're doing

7491.719 --> 7495.38
they're not actually even checking

7493.52 --> 7497.679
whether I am correct or not about

7495.38 --> 7497.679
anything

7511.46 --> 7516.86
all right anyway it's something and

7514.52 --> 7519.860000000001
now we I at least I got that out of the

7516.86 --> 7522.92
way I mean every time something like

7519.86 --> 7525.679
this happens I

7522.92 --> 7528.7390000000005
my model the model of how things

7525.679 --> 7531.1990000000005
actually work on Earth in my mind gets

7528.739 --> 7533.9
improved bit by bit

7531.199 --> 7538.219
and now I'm like this one's never gonna

7533.9 --> 7540.259999999999
be mistaken again about in this specific

7538.219 --> 7542.78
subject I mean

7540.26 --> 7545.54
because yeah I mean

7542.78 --> 7547.4
no lessons are learned more thoroughly

7545.54 --> 7550.28
than those that have actually

7547.4 --> 7552.82
embarrassed the [ __ ] out of you if you

7550.28 --> 7552.82
know what I mean

7553.04 --> 7558.139
and I am embarrassed I hate it I hate

7555.56 --> 7560.42
when this sort of things happen a lot

7558.139 --> 7562.159000000001
like enough to actually start hitting

7560.42 --> 7565.9400000000005
myself in the face for it but I'm not

7562.159 --> 7565.94
gonna do that because pointless

7566.32 --> 7569.719
I hate it when they make mistakes like

7568.94 --> 7573.46
that

7569.719 --> 7573.46
I hate it thoroughly

7580.659 --> 7587.9
but it also makes me think like I

7584.48 --> 7590.119
I just need to kind of ignore Ryan

7587.9 --> 7592.339999999999
I do because he's a blabber mouth he

7590.119 --> 7595.219
says things and they're sometimes just

7592.34 --> 7597.8
really incorrect

7595.219 --> 7600.5
I need to just not listen to him as much

7597.8 --> 7602.2390000000005
as I have

7600.5 --> 7605.86
am I going to bring this up with Brian

7602.239 --> 7605.86
next fed probably

7606.08 --> 7612.199
but I I yeah it's annoying because I got

7609.32 --> 7615.259999999999
into a spat with him on Friday

7612.199 --> 7617.659
already I literally just apologized to

7615.26 --> 7620.179
him yesterday

7617.659 --> 7623.619
in Skype

7620.179 --> 7628.3
for by flying off the handle so this is

7623.619 --> 7628.299999999999
great it's just [ __ ] great

7629.119 --> 7635.139
I mean the timing of these things is

7631.34 --> 7635.139
just aggravating as [ __ ]

7636.44 --> 7641.54
why couldn't this be figured out [ __ ]

7639.619 --> 7644.36
four days ago

7641.54 --> 7647.0199999999995
then I'd actually have a moment where I

7644.36 --> 7651.38
could do something with it

7647.02 --> 7654.080000000001
just what is going on man

7651.38 --> 7657.8
going on in these last [ __ ] five days

7654.08 --> 7660.46
what the [ __ ] is happening

7657.8 --> 7663.9800000000005
I've never had so many [ __ ]

7660.46 --> 7667.219
cataclysms following each other up like

7663.98 --> 7669.638999999999
as in the last freaking five days it's

7667.219 --> 7669.639
crazy

7670.78 --> 7674.98
what the [ __ ] is happening

7690.44 --> 7693.5199999999995
all right anyway

7701.96 --> 7707.08
all right anyway yeah I'm gonna let it

7704.84 --> 7707.08
go

7707.599 --> 7713.4800000000005
not be [ __ ] negative about it

7710.9 --> 7715.94
I try to follow on Benjamin's example

7713.48 --> 7720.138999999999
and just be [ __ ] happy and let it

7715.94 --> 7722.78
[ __ ] go because it's all pointless

7720.139 --> 7726.139
pointless to feel bad about it

7722.78 --> 7728.96
so yeah I made a mistake I made mistakes

7726.139 --> 7731.619
more often than I would like to admit

7728.96 --> 7731.619
that I do

7731.659 --> 7737.299999999999
that's it now it's corrected I'm never

7734.36 --> 7741.199
making that mistake again ever

7737.3 --> 7744.7390000000005
and hopefully the next time I will not

7741.199 --> 7747.44
make such a type of mistake again and I

7744.739 --> 7751.239
will actually just check a story before

7747.44 --> 7751.239
making a show out of it

7761.719 --> 7765.08
because apparently it doesn't really

7763.219 --> 7767.119
matter what source you just can't take

7765.08 --> 7769.639
anything for granted anymore nothing

7767.119 --> 7772.639
ever

7769.639 --> 7772.639
foreign

7776.0 --> 7781.0
right

7777.56 --> 7781.0
anyway that's out of the way

7785.9 --> 7790.119
hope you all enjoyed the show though

7791.96 --> 7798.219
this fight yeah some complainy pants

7794.9 --> 7798.219
behavior from my side

7800.239 --> 7807.379999999999
trolls really I get so sick of it I mean

7803.42 --> 7810.38

7807.38 --> 7813.159000000001
mean people you guys are in the chat but

7810.38 --> 7813.159000000001

7816.86 --> 7821.38

7845.54 --> 7851.84
weather okay but no not really

7848.96 --> 7854.36

7851.84 --> 7856.639
I'm not really gonna do anything outside

7854.36 --> 7858.259999999999
I mean I'm gonna go for groceries in a

7856.639 --> 7861.32
bit but
