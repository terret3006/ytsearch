I mean yesterday I was kind of sick

417.72 --> 423.47900000000004
now whether that's because of just not

420.78 --> 426.479
enough good food for a while although I

423.479 --> 429.12
have been having the inner food thing so

426.479 --> 431.52
that has definitely helped I think

429.12 --> 434.819
but

431.52 --> 440.12
yeah we'll see this evening when I like

434.819 --> 440.12

you mean at some point the body's just

658.92 --> 664.74
gotta go through some stuff especially

661.62 --> 668.54

792.959 --> 795.4399999999999
the show

799.8 --> 804.5

802.2 --> 804.5
flow

805.18 --> 812.669
[Music]

813.74 --> 818.639
but it yeah it might also be kind of

816.72 --> 821.399
retraction symptoms because I really

818.639 --> 823.639
haven't smoked any cannabis now in two

821.399 --> 823.639
days

823.8 --> 830.519
barely not enough to yeah to stop that

827.76 --> 833.1
withdrawal situation

830.519 --> 834.24
and because I yeah I'm an everyday

833.1 --> 840.37

[Music]

840.899 --> 845.66

1012.38 --> 1017.8389999999999
am I okay yeah I've been better

1015.98 --> 1020.6
I think I might be

1017.839 --> 1023.48
like a little under the weather

1020.6 --> 1026.26
it's also because of just poor diet in

1023.48 --> 1026.26
the last week

1027.38 --> 1033.0200000000002
and withdrawal symptoms from cannabis

1030.919 --> 1035.199
which I haven't smoked properly in two

1033.02 --> 1035.199
days

1038.839 --> 1042.74
and yeah the whole weather transition I

1041.0 --> 1046.66
mean yesterday was officially a record

1042.74 --> 1046.66
cold day for the Netherlands so

1049.04 --> 1052.12
it's like 12 degrees

1063.679 --> 1066.52
right

1067.52 --> 1071.299
maybe it's also because I just ate

1069.679 --> 1073.88
something and I haven't really eaten

1071.299 --> 1075.98
anything yesterday properly

1073.88 --> 1077.96
so that now all the blood is just

1075.98 --> 1079.7
rushing to my stomach to kind of start

1077.96 --> 1081.679
collecting or something

1079.7 --> 1084.5800000000002
that might also be why I feel a little

1566.9 --> 1571.039
why are they fighting when they're both

1569.6 --> 1574.039
crap teams

1571.039 --> 1577.82
well generally I mean because there's

1574.039 --> 1580.1589999999999
like this long-term rivalry between

1577.82 --> 1581.96
the two religions because of India and

1580.159 --> 1584.8400000000001
Pakistan

1581.96 --> 1588.6200000000001
like always arguing and bickering over

1584.84 --> 1588.62
Kashmir province

1588.98 --> 1593.919
so that's why it's basically just

1594.08 --> 1598.279
an excuse to go at it it's like

1596.72 --> 1600.94
hooliganism

1598.279 --> 1600.94
I think

1601.58 --> 1606.9399999999998
kind of like how do football Hooligans

1604.4 --> 1610.22
from the 90s were always like super

1606.94 --> 1612.679
anti-german and all that in England

1610.22 --> 1616.039

1612.679 --> 1617.19

outstressed and all that now typically

unlike Klaus swab did you know that he's

1992.899 --> 1996.5
actually

1994.0 --> 1999.98
directly related

1996.5 --> 2001.84
to Karl Marx

1999.98 --> 2004.96
like their cousins

2001.84 --> 2007.36
and Schwab was like

2004.96 --> 2009.94
descendant from

2007.36 --> 2012.1
a family that basically had the same

2009.94 --> 2013.96
name as Marx but they changed their name

2012.1 --> 2015.1589999999999
quite early on but they're literally

2013.96 --> 2017.679
family

2015.159 --> 2021.8200000000002
did you know that

2017.679 --> 2024.1000000000001
that Klaus Schwab is literally family

2021.82 --> 2027.4189999999999
of Karl Marx

in a way I'm ashamed that I have not

been able to really contribute as much

2268.24 --> 2272.02
because I've kind of been sick and

2270.4 --> 2273.46
really disappointed

2272.02 --> 2274.72
because

2273.46 --> 2277.0
yeah

2274.72 --> 2280.359
and like what some people like to think

2277.0 --> 2282.52
I have feelings and it does actually

2280.359 --> 2286.06
really hurt me

2282.52 --> 2290.38
especially about Jaren doing this

2286.06 --> 2292.42
not that I love him but I always thought

2290.38 --> 2294.7000000000003
like yeah

2292.42 --> 2298.3
that's a guy that's gonna stay neutral

2294.7 --> 2299.98
like he knows like he's not gonna do

2298.3 --> 2302.2000000000003
something like that and then he did it

2299.98 --> 2305.7400000000002
and and he's doubling down and he's even

2302.2 --> 2308.3799999999997
claimed victim status for it on Facebook

2305.74 --> 2312.2999999999997
totally absurd but I'm what I'm kind of

2308.38 --> 2312.3
worried about right now is David Weiss

2312.64 --> 2318.0989999999997
he's also said some things and I really

2315.579 --> 2321.3390000000004
hope that he's just not gonna go there

2318.099 --> 2323.8590000000004
it's so miserable for everybody

2321.339 --> 2326.46
and might be surprised it's going to be

2323.859 --> 2329.2
especially miserable for them because

2326.46 --> 2331.96
Flat Earth debate has a very wide reach

2329.2 --> 2334.5989999999997
and there's a lot of very very smart

2331.96 --> 2337.359
people that like it

2334.599 --> 2339.839
like really accomplished people

2337.359 --> 2339.839
yeah

2339.88 --> 2344.6800000000003
not just a couple of Spin Doctors really

2342.88 --> 2348.52
accomplished people so they're gonna

2344.68 --> 2350.3199999999997
listen to what Nason says and what we

2348.52 --> 2354.22
say

2350.32 --> 2357.7200000000003
not to Globe Masters as much so like I

2354.22 --> 2360.64
think that like Globus is just super

2357.72 --> 2362.8799999999997
overestimating their own power like with

2360.64 --> 2364.72
the public I think they're really

2362.88 --> 2366.6400000000003
overestimating it

2364.72 --> 2369.48
and it's gonna bite them in the ass

2366.64 --> 2369.48
really bad

2373.54 --> 2379.42
okay okay Nathan I said I didn't say he

2376.54 --> 2382.06
is in it I'm just I'm worried about it I

2379.42 --> 2384.28
I really hope you're right Nathan you

2382.06 --> 2387.88
know but the thing is I felt the same

2384.28 --> 2392.44
way about Jaren well more so about Dave

2387.88 --> 2395.76
so I am worried if you know what I mean

2392.44 --> 2395.76
I mean I really like Dave

2395.98 --> 2401.079
like he's one of the guys that that kind

2398.32 --> 2403.2400000000002
of helped motivate me to to start my own

2401.079 --> 2406.44
channel on Flat Earth

2403.24 --> 2406.4399999999996
I know he's cool

2407.38 --> 2411.1800000000003
I just hope he stays that way

2412.66 --> 2420.66
but yeah I'll I'll Trust you on that

2416.74 --> 2420.66
Nathan I really hope you're right though

2425.44 --> 2428.859
deserve zero blowback

2428.859 --> 2433.72
well look as long as he doesn't do

2430.78 --> 2436.78
anything like make any stupid solo

2441.0 --> 2447.579
we don't I think he said like we don't

2445.48 --> 2449.26
like we don't stick to the Flat Earth

2447.579 --> 2450.28

like in 2017.

2591.4 --> 2595.359
but I thought it was like too stupid a

thing to say to make it into a thing so

2595.359 --> 2599.74
I just like yeah yeah

2597.64 --> 2601.06
I might say it in chat

2599.74 --> 2604.66

so

2756.52 --> 2762.839
talking about Jason Brown

2759.579 --> 2762.8390000000004

[Music]

2770.68 --> 2773.93
why not

2796.78 --> 2804.1600000000003
literally made my mark that like the

2800.56 --> 2806.619
first breaking manifest of like hey

2804.16 --> 2810.54
I think this is a thing I think this is

2806.619 --> 2810.54
really out there like that's real

2811.48 --> 2815.7400000000002
I'm very proud of it and it's pretty

2813.52 --> 2817.3
recent even I mean I had the conception

2815.74 --> 2820.72
of non-space

2817.3 --> 2823.2400000000002
I even spoke about it like in 2017 I

2820.72 --> 2826.0
think 18.

2823.24 --> 2829.14
not I think I even mentioned it like on

2826.0 --> 2829.14
my flat Earth talks already

2831.22 --> 2836.5789999999997
okay so why rest that hello by the way

2841.7 --> 2845.4689999999996
[Music]

2846.88 --> 2850.599
all right so I came up with it kind of

2849.04 --> 2854.2599999999998
early but

2850.599 --> 2856.9
I didn't have like a name for it yet

2854.26 --> 2858.579
I I called it like the end of available

2856.9 --> 2862.359
space

2858.579 --> 2864.2200000000003
like yeah the limit to the volume but

2862.359 --> 2867.17
that's all kind of non-specific so

2864.22 --> 2870.479
non-space would be what is there

2867.17 --> 2870.4790000000003
[Music]

2871.3 --> 2876.48
okay but yeah restab welcome back it's

2873.94 --> 2876.48
been a while

2876.7 --> 2879.8999999999996
what was on the podcast

2882.37 --> 2887.92

2925.5 --> 2929.94
stuff is called yeah but that's not what

2928.0 --> 2934.119
I'm talking about lva I'm talking about

2929.94 --> 2936.28
non-space specifically the opposite

2934.119 --> 2938.579
the complete

2936.28 --> 2941.44
lack of all

2938.579 --> 2943.42
volumetric capability

2941.44 --> 2946.7200000000003
uh

2943.42 --> 2949.38
David Weiss stole that name

2946.72 --> 2949.3799999999997
what

2950.56 --> 2957.339
okay well look deep inside the rabbit

2954.22 --> 2958.8999999999996
hole is not exactly a super original

2957.339 --> 2962.14
name

2958.9 --> 2966.1600000000003
that's the hat so

2962.14 --> 2968.5
that's like saying oh the hammer man he

2966.16 --> 2970.54
stole that name the hammer there's so

2968.5 --> 2972.76
many references to that hammer he stole

2970.54 --> 2975.67
it yeah

2972.76 --> 2982.13
but so what

2975.67 --> 2982.13
[Music]

2988.54 --> 2993.7
like Canada

2990.76 --> 2996.6400000000003

2993.7 --> 3002.1189999999997

2996.64 --> 3002.1189999999997
mind it was nasty and what the [ __ ] okay

3007.98 --> 3013.5
when when did that happen

3010.38 --> 3016.28
I mean David Weiss has been having that

3013.5 --> 3020.54
name for his channel since

3016.28 --> 3020.5400000000004
2015 or 16 or something

3031.38 --> 3038.0
yes we just seen it great description

3033.48 --> 3038.0

foreign

3057.72 --> 3060.72
okay

3060.78 --> 3066.2400000000002
dubious where's that dubious for sure

3063.66 --> 3068.41
but what about the guy

3066.24 --> 3069.8999999999996
that he supposedly stole this from

3068.41 --> 3072.5989999999997

3069.9 --> 3074.64
like what is he doing is he still there

does he have any videos that

3162.9 --> 3169.099
specifically address this oh and by the

3165.0 --> 3169.099
way is he a flat Earth or is he not

3181.98 --> 3184.64
okay

3186.839 --> 3192.119
is he any good because every single

3189.839 --> 3194.599
photo I see him on he kind of looks a

3192.119 --> 3194.599
bit gay

3196.8 --> 3201.599
but maybe he's really funny I don't know

3199.619 --> 3203.839
I guess I'll check out some of his

3201.599 --> 3203.839

oh wait is it

3257.7 --> 3263.339
Mike Canon's huge mistake

3532.799 --> 3537.96
it myself it's just like oh it just gets

3535.619 --> 3541.579
rolling because when I'm tired it's just

3537.96 --> 3541.579
like this card it goes like

3542.77 --> 3547.5
[Music]

3545.4 --> 3549.6600000000003
and but then it's like oh it goes and

3547.5 --> 3551.819
it's just like oh I'm driving oh okay

3549.66 --> 3554.839
and then I kind of forget about it it

3551.819 --> 3554.839
just starts working again

3554.88 --> 3558.6800000000003
but I do feel better now yeah

3560.88 --> 3565.1600000000003

3595.11 --> 3598.8990000000003
[Music]

3606.72 --> 3613.9199999999996
but it might also be that yeah normal

3610.44 --> 3616.14
people that visit the Flat Earth debates

3613.92 --> 3619.5
are figuring out that there is no live

3616.14 --> 3622.0789999999997
show no panel open and all that

3619.5 --> 3624.599
so they're probably like oh wait what's

3622.079 --> 3627.54
happening oh let me check Arwin he

3624.599 --> 3631.079
always streams right before Nathan and

3627.54 --> 3634.44
now he's in the chat even so

3631.079 --> 3636.48
I think that's what mostly happens

3634.44 --> 3638.579
when Nathan doesn't do a stream and then

3636.48 --> 3640.619
I just get a lot of people that would

3638.579 --> 3642.7000000000003
normally watch The Flat Earth debates

3640.619 --> 3648.88
watch me

3773.579 --> 3779.7000000000003
well John Thor is an an uplinker he just

3777.42 --> 3783.619
takes videos that he thinks are

3779.7 --> 3783.6189999999997
noteworthy and then he shares them

3786.359 --> 3790.88
um

3788.16 --> 3790.8799999999997
foreign

3791.299 --> 3798.5
I mean he posted that because they went

3795.24 --> 3798.5
up against this baller

3800.76 --> 3806.4
but I don't think that John Thor is like

3803.16 --> 3809.0989999999997
really into like oh the groups and all

3806.4 --> 3812.96
they've gone in fighting I don't think

3809.099 --> 3812.96
he really cares about that at all

3813.299 --> 3818.339
I don't think he really likes to get

3814.92 --> 3820.6800000000003

3818.339 --> 3823.619
doesn't seem like a highly opinionated

3823.619 --> 3828.42
makes in his videos

3825.24 --> 3830.2799999999997
just likes to share stuff so

3828.42 --> 3833.599
right and he didn't like delete my

comment he just left it there

3834.54 --> 3837.2

horrible inhumane disgusting things if

he thinks it's gonna give him credit

4458.179 --> 4462.4400000000005
you would have to be to do that to be

4982.1 --> 4988.64
your Offspring is not going to be taller

4984.76 --> 4989.84
yeah so it's completely pointless

4988.64 --> 4993.320000000001
[Music]

4989.84 --> 4995.2390000000005
well like oh yes oh I want a tall man

4993.32 --> 4996.92
yeah and then you're gonna get kids with

4995.239 --> 5000.28
that tall man and they're gonna be

4996.92 --> 5001.54
[ __ ] little Grappler midgets

5000.28 --> 5003.699
goody

5001.54 --> 5006.88
what you're gonna give them all leg

5003.699 --> 5009.759999999999
lengthening too I bet that cosmetic

5006.88 --> 5012.4800000000005
surgery will love that oh they'll love

5009.76 --> 5012.4800000000005
it yeah

5013.6 --> 5016.6
no

5019.84 --> 5026.88
hey Dan Winfield let's see you

5022.9 --> 5026.879999999999
you're the second one to say that today

5045.94 --> 5051.239
okay that's a little bit rude Tony with

5048.94 --> 5051.239
him

5058.48 --> 5064.48
okay rest ahead I'm sure that works

5061.719 --> 5067.44
totally Flawless and it's not gonna go

5064.48 --> 5067.44
wrong at all

5068.5 --> 5074.679
I mean only thing you're doing is just

5071.08 --> 5076.54
completely breaking your genetic line

5074.679 --> 5078.159
which you don't understand what that's

5076.54 --> 5080.739
gonna do

5078.159 --> 5084.0
at all I mean you might think like oh

5080.739 --> 5084.0
yeah just just edit

5088.42 --> 5093.219
it's like hey a hundred other things

5090.4 --> 5096.82
that you might not even notice until you

5093.219 --> 5099.1
get another generation after you yeah

5096.82 --> 5100.84
totally insane

5099.1 --> 5102.159000000001
Chris bring your own family you don't

5100.84 --> 5104.1990000000005
know what the [ __ ] you're doing you're

5102.159 --> 5105.339999999999
potentially just destroying your

5104.199 --> 5107.5
bloodline

5105.34 --> 5110.1990000000005
you don't know what it does

5107.5 --> 5112.719
they say oh it does this but you don't

5110.199 --> 5115.54
know what that does they say they know

5112.719 --> 5118.06
what it does they don't

5115.54 --> 5119.92
they're testing and testing all these

5118.06 --> 5122.1990000000005
tests are super short term

5119.92 --> 5124.2390000000005
I mean is there really like genetic

5122.199 --> 5127.239
modification tests where they then say

5124.239 --> 5131.139999999999
okay now let's breed these

5127.239 --> 5134.5
for like five or six Generations

5131.14 --> 5135.46
and they don't do that why wouldn't they

5134.5 --> 5137.739
do that

5135.46 --> 5141.58
could it be because

5137.739 --> 5144.299999999999
[ __ ] don't procreate anymore

5141.58 --> 5144.3
perhaps

5144.34 --> 5151.4800000000005
you know

5146.62 --> 5154.0
genetic modification is a bad idea

5151.48 --> 5158.62
it's been

5154.0 --> 5161.58
echoed for an extremely long time

5158.62 --> 5161.58
I wouldn't do it

5165.76 --> 5170.92
I mean the furthest I'd ever even go

5168.58 --> 5172.239
theoretically if the circumstances were

5170.92 --> 5174.04
like really

5172.239 --> 5175.599999999999
urgent

5174.04 --> 5178.8
would be

5175.6 --> 5178.8
to kind of like

5178.98 --> 5185.919999999999
genetic combine with

5182.38 --> 5188.4400000000005
another family member as in you're gonna

5185.92 --> 5190.06
not just like oh let's edit that you

5188.44 --> 5193.48
know

5190.06 --> 5196.179
replace it with another natural piece of

5193.48 --> 5198.58
genetics from the same family it would

5196.179 --> 5199.78
be like detailed cross breeding

5198.58 --> 5202.6
basically

5199.78 --> 5204.639
I think that would be more feasible

5202.6 --> 5206.860000000001
because then you're not like inserting

5204.639 --> 5209.32
anything purely artificial you're just

5206.86 --> 5212.679
replacing a part with another part that

5209.32 --> 5215.32
is natural I think that would be a lot

5212.679 --> 5217.179
safer

5215.32 --> 5218.739
safe yeah

5217.179 --> 5220.719
I don't know

5218.739 --> 5222.099999999999
I'm not a geneticist

5220.719 --> 5225.159
but just

5222.1 --> 5227.38
genetic modification to like get other

5225.159 --> 5229.599999999999
abilities for your Offspring seems

5227.38 --> 5233.88
extremely risky

5229.6 --> 5233.88
you don't know what it really does

5233.92 --> 5238.9
and these genetic scientists they say

5236.679 --> 5241.2390000000005
they know what it does they only do that

5238.9 --> 5242.799999999999
on the short run they don't know what

5241.239 --> 5245.739
actually happens

5242.8 --> 5248.6990000000005
on the long run

5245.739 --> 5248.699
don't do it

5252.159 --> 5257.259999999999
all right Nathan yeah thanks for popping

5254.8 --> 5259.360000000001
by it was good to have you here

5257.26 --> 5260.860000000001
was entertaining

5259.36 --> 5262.0
it's a kind of good chat today in

5260.86 --> 5264.219
general

5262.0 --> 5266.4
I think I hit like 50 watching at some

5264.219 --> 5266.4
point

5274.6 --> 5276.96
what

5278.56 --> 5281.219
foreign

5283.36 --> 5289.62
okay if it's all in good fun to any

5285.94 --> 5289.62
Whitcomb that then it's no problem

5294.1 --> 5300.1
right yeah PGC net there's that and

5298.06 --> 5302.02
there's the natural lesson because did

5300.1 --> 5304.6
you know I don't know if it's even been

5302.02 --> 5307.84
widely spread around but that

5304.6 --> 5310.780000000001
for example genetically modified crops

5307.84 --> 5313.4800000000005
they just die out

5310.78 --> 5316.36
did you know that if you mix it up with

5313.48 --> 5317.739
regular crops then in like three

5316.36 --> 5320.5
generations

5317.739 --> 5322.239
all the genetically modified crops are

5320.5 --> 5324.219
gone

5322.239 --> 5327.879999999999
they're just gone

5324.219 --> 5327.88
they self-extinguish

5329.139 --> 5332.92
because of the genetic modification

5330.88 --> 5335.139
because it's not natural and you put

5332.92 --> 5336.37
them in between natural and they just

5335.139 --> 5341.289
die

5336.37 --> 5341.289
[Music]

5342.58 --> 5346.48
because you're back that you have his

5344.679 --> 5348.52
life

5346.48 --> 5350.259999999999
well it's good to have you back but it

5348.52 --> 5352.4800000000005
was kind of lively even before you

5350.26 --> 5355.62
arrived

5352.48 --> 5355.62
but it's good to have you back

5371.98 --> 5375.299999999999
I'm joking okay

5378.34 --> 5382.2390000000005
I don't know how I would

5380.62 --> 5385.48
be able to

5382.239 --> 5387.78
see that that is what you were doing but

5385.48 --> 5387.78
sure

5388.15 --> 5391.299999999999
[Music]

5393.97 --> 5399.229
[Music]

5408.4 --> 5413.739
right but yeah pjc net I agree but I

5411.699 --> 5415.839999999999
think that there is like a viable

5413.739 --> 5417.82
direction right it's just the same as

5415.84 --> 5421.0
like with cross breeding

5417.82 --> 5424.92
of animals and plants I mean it's been

5421.0 --> 5426.52
done for a thousand years or more

5424.92 --> 5428.5
[Music]

5426.52 --> 5430.4800000000005
especially animals that's how the

5428.5 --> 5431.679
animals have become the way they are to

5430.48 --> 5433.919999999999
us today

5431.679 --> 5435.9400000000005
through cross reading thousands of years

5433.92 --> 5438.6990000000005
plants it's a little bit more

5435.94 --> 5441.04
complicated but they exist I eat like a

5438.699 --> 5445.178999999999
crossbreed plant that's a crossover

5441.04 --> 5446.679
between asparagus and broccoli and it's

5445.179 --> 5449.92
awesome

5446.679 --> 5451.6
and there was no crispr [ __ ] involved as

5449.92 --> 5454.3
far as I know at least

5451.6 --> 5457.42
I hope not but it's great it works great

5454.3 --> 5459.28
and it's classified organic so I take it

5457.42 --> 5461.4400000000005
there's no genetic modification like

5459.28 --> 5463.659
that involved

5461.44 --> 5467.5599999999995
but I think that if you're gonna do like

5463.659 --> 5467.5599999999995
genetic level editing

5467.62 --> 5472.659
don't

5468.76 --> 5475.54
you could just do edit uh grafting

5472.659 --> 5477.759999999999
basically right take a piece of genetics

5475.54 --> 5480.219
somebody that is actually a living

5477.76 --> 5483.9400000000005
person with functioning genetics

5480.219 --> 5487.4800000000005
and then try to modify your genetics or

5483.94 --> 5490.9
your offspring with that real piece of

5487.48 --> 5493.959999999999
genetics so it's like a symbol from real

5490.9 --> 5497.199
functioning things rather than just like

5493.96 --> 5499.4800000000005
chemically alter and just make something

5497.199 --> 5501.339999999999
completely new

5499.48 --> 5504.178999999999
in there

5501.34 --> 5507.96
which is potentially extremely dangerous

5504.179 --> 5507.96
especially on the long run

5508.719 --> 5513.52
although it's not even half as risky as

5511.239 --> 5515.919999999999
the whole nonsense Gene gun that they

5513.52 --> 5518.5
tried in the 90s Monsanto mostly because

5515.92 --> 5521.32
that's just a pure disaster

5518.5 --> 5525.42
crispr is less disastrous

5521.32 --> 5525.42
but still I wouldn't recommend it

5526.719 --> 5530.46
just don't don't do it

5548.52 --> 5558.580000000001
[Music]

5570.58 --> 5573.58
huh

5583.78 --> 5586.969999999999
[Music]

5589.19 --> 5592.71
[Music]

5595.42 --> 5601.0
that's right biggest CNET so if you're

5597.88 --> 5604.78
gonna do it another way besides cross

5601.0 --> 5608.56
braiding then genetic grafting

5604.78 --> 5612.48
might be the next best option

5608.56 --> 5612.4800000000005
before you go to crispr

5618.75 --> 5621.88
[Music]

5627.1 --> 5631.139
which is by the way kind of funny a

5629.08 --> 5633.42
little silly reference

5631.139 --> 5636.28
from GI Joe

5633.42 --> 5639.88
remember serpenter

5636.28 --> 5641.5
well he was actually genetically grafted

5639.88 --> 5644.02
together

5641.5 --> 5647.199
that was like way before there was even

5644.02 --> 5649.96
knowledge of crispr and all that [ __ ]

5647.199 --> 5652.299999999999
but it was like yeah that was the story

5649.96 --> 5655.12
they got to all the tombs of famous

5652.3 --> 5656.92
leaders and then they grafted they took

5655.12 --> 5659.98
the genetics of it and then they put it

5656.92 --> 5662.7390000000005
together and it somehow worked right

5659.98 --> 5665.259999999999
okay but that is effectively a form of

5662.739 --> 5667.78
genetic rafting taking real pieces of

5665.26 --> 5670.06
genetics from living beings and then

5667.78 --> 5673.36
putting it together

5670.06 --> 5674.8
or altering an existing form

5673.36 --> 5677.259999999999
right

5674.8 --> 5681.54
I think crispr it goes way beyond that

5677.26 --> 5681.54
it just literally becomes editing

5681.58 --> 5687.159
on a micro level which is very different

5684.1 --> 5689.139
no life every day that's right Stevie

I don't know how we ended up with this

5728.92 --> 5733.719
I think it was in response to yeah yeah

5731.02 --> 5737.9800000000005
the leg enhancement

5733.719 --> 5740.44
created surgery what a crazy [ __ ]

it yourself too

it would be kind of silly if you're that

6069.6 --> 6073.7390000000005
little slow but yeah it was decently

6072.0 --> 6077.54
entertaining I thought

6073.739 --> 6077.54
right hey what's that

6082.32 --> 6086.159
oh

6084.719 --> 6088.7390000000005
right

6086.159 --> 6092.04

6088.739 --> 6095.459999999999
like the last few minutes so

6092.04 --> 6098.3
but thanks for linking that

6095.46 --> 6098.3
Adam again

6098.58 --> 6102.96
I wasn't really part of like that entire

6100.8 --> 6105.1990000000005
show I just dropped in like the last few

6102.96 --> 6105.199
minutes

6105.9 --> 6111.839999999999
but anyway yeah make sure to check out

6109.739 --> 6113.699

[Music]

6160.88 --> 6165.56

6171.06 --> 6175.280000000001
wow where the hell did you dig that up

6177.3 --> 6181.679
yeah it's a bit late for that I'm still

6179.4 --> 6182.54
gonna run out but what the that's really

6181.679 --> 6185.52
weird

6182.54 --> 6186.6
electrics Chopsticks to make it taste

saltier

6186.6 --> 6191.58
okay

6188.76 --> 6193.4400000000005
I guess if you're like really if Salt's

6191.58 --> 6195.6
a real risk factor for you that might be

6193.44 --> 6197.5199999999995
nice

6195.6 --> 6198.3
anyway I'm still rounding out the show
