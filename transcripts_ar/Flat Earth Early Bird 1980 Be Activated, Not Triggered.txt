it's been mostly sunny there's a lot of

146.519 --> 150.959
wind

though let's see if I can

150.959 --> 155.28
just camera to yeah there you

go yeah it actually kind of feels like

165.92 --> 168.35999999999999
summer

170.84 --> 176.4
now so that temperature increase

173.48 --> 179.92
probably did

176.4 --> 183.20000000000002
happen it's been kind of nice glad that

179.92 --> 187.04
they actually for a change managed to

183.2 --> 187.04
not go to bed so incredibly

188.52 --> 192.61
[Music]

194.239 --> 198.76
late right and I'm on time for the

201.84 --> 206.92000000000002
show

203.879 --> 209.12
somebody's drilling or I don't know what

206.92 --> 211.76
they're doing making machine noise

209.12 --> 213.76
though

211.76 --> 219.79899999999998
oh

213.76 --> 219.79899999999998
well it is Monday the 17th of June

225.56 --> 233.959
2024 temperatures 21° C 0% precipitation

230.959 --> 233.959
55%

237.12 --> 241.92000000000002
humidity yeah hopefully this is is

240.12 --> 244.84
actually the start of some summer

241.92 --> 247.72
weather it does feel like it and

244.84 --> 250.32
I'm relieved in a

247.72 --> 253.079
way it's about damn

250.32 --> 258.32
[Music]

253.079 --> 258.32
time right and yeah episode

259.28 --> 265.07899999999995
1980 it's the year year of my birth

274.28 --> 277.19899999999996
would have ever thought I would make it

276.039 --> 281.44
this

277.199 --> 284.72
far yesterday of course yeah super short

281.44 --> 288.24
show seemed like nobody was showing up

284.72 --> 289.72
except for D bickering and Richard G I

288.24 --> 291.039
mean it was nice to have him there but

289.72 --> 293.28000000000003
then he just

291.039 --> 299.36
stopped talking everybody stopped

293.28 --> 299.35999999999996
talking and I was like I don't want to

299.759 --> 302.6
sit here in

304.16 --> 310.44
silence so I just rounded it out short

308.08 --> 314.32
probably shouldn't have been

310.44 --> 316.16
so fussy about it though I was just kind

314.32 --> 316.96
of really disappointed because I did

316.16 --> 320.28000000000003
have

316.96 --> 324.08
energy but I was also just

320.28 --> 325.84
impatient right today it's different so

324.08 --> 329.08
we'll see what happens maybe nobody

325.84 --> 331.4
shows up it is a Monday after all and

329.08 --> 335.59999999999997
I'm On Top I'm not expecting anybody to

331.4 --> 339.71999999999997
show up this first hour at least just

335.6 --> 343.91900000000004
talk and yeah when I get like that also

339.72 --> 346.03900000000004
I do afterward realize I just forget oh

343.919 --> 349.12
wait there's also just an audience

346.039 --> 353.759
pretty much watching out there after the

349.12 --> 353.759
fact and yeah I can't really blame

355.56 --> 360.28000000000003
them I'm working on it

368.52 --> 377.0
right so yeah I am well provided though

374.0 --> 377.0
with

379.96 --> 385.28
coffee and an Illuminati cound that's

382.88 --> 390.12
actually holding

385.28 --> 390.11999999999995
together not being so fragile

398.919 --> 404.31899999999996
right so yeah I hope everybody had a

401.8 --> 407.44
nice Father's day

404.319 --> 410.40000000000003
yesterday I did also call my dad just

407.44 --> 412.0
have a nice conversation but he also

410.4 --> 413.96
didn't realize it was Father's Day

412.0 --> 420.44
because it's just not really a

413.96 --> 422.96
thing in our family never was really

420.44 --> 425.759
it we just looked at it as like a

422.96 --> 425.75899999999996
society

430.16 --> 435.199
thing and there was a lot of like that

433.28 --> 438.479
we don't talk about that

435.199 --> 440.84000000000003
but there was a lot of like hassle also

438.479 --> 442.28
surrounding the whole father role within

440.84 --> 445.11999999999995
the family

442.28 --> 446.32
and my dad was always getting like the

445.12 --> 448.52
blame for

446.32 --> 450.84
[Music]

448.52 --> 453.08
everything so that also didn't really

450.84 --> 455.71999999999997
help but n that's really that's not

453.08 --> 457.599
really my young years though that's more

455.72 --> 459.68
around my

457.599 --> 462.24
teens that the whole thing kind of

459.68 --> 462.24
started to

466.599 --> 470.599
destabilize

468.56 --> 473.28000000000003
right

470.599 --> 477.87899999999996
anyway

473.28 --> 477.87899999999996
yeah so yeah yesterday

485.319 --> 490.84000000000003
didn't get much feedback except for just

488.319 --> 492.8
people like trying to generally deplete

490.84 --> 496.919
me in my morality or

492.8 --> 496.919
whatever and just wonder

497.28 --> 501.23999999999995
why what the hell what all these flies

499.759 --> 504.12
doing here all of a sudden where are

501.24 --> 504.12
they even coming

504.84 --> 509.11999999999995
from hold on

536.36 --> 539.839
H whatever

546.0 --> 549.0
ah

556.32 --> 560.0390000000001
[Music]

572.72 --> 578.72
really hope that guy's going to take a

574.44 --> 578.72
break soon this is getting on my

580.89 --> 585.87
[Music]

587.04 --> 591.4399999999999
nerves

588.959 --> 594.64
hey that sounds like he's going to take

591.44 --> 594.6400000000001
a break

606.399 --> 610.399
oh whatever

632.63 --> 635.799
[Music]

638.92 --> 642.929
[Music]

648.48 --> 651.48
what

660.83 --> 663.95
[Music]

683.4 --> 687.429
[Music]

688.04 --> 693.56
good uh just bumped into an article more

691.56 --> 697.76
hassle

693.56 --> 701.04
than with the whole green agenda crap

697.76 --> 705.04
here in Europe it's not very nice hey

701.04 --> 707.7199999999999
LSG first in chat good to see

705.04 --> 712.48
you ah thanks for

707.72 --> 712.48
joining hope you're doing well

720.93 --> 727.049
[Music]

742.53 --> 749.3199999999999
[Music]

745.16 --> 749.3199999999999
holy [ __ ] this guy

768.959 --> 774.04
yeah it's got all open windows and it's

771.92 --> 777.8389999999999
projecting right

774.04 --> 781.12
here that's why it's making so much

777.839 --> 781.12
noise GH

785.76 --> 788.72
whatever I have to

791.67 --> 796.3499999999999
[Music]

800.16 --> 808.16
manage right didn't really have much of

803.68 --> 811.4799999999999
a cohesive subject at hand I mean my

808.16 --> 814.279
thoughts have been all over over the

811.48 --> 817.519
place sometimes I wish I would make more

814.279 --> 819.519
notes but I mean a lot of yeah my higher

817.519 --> 823.32
thoughts do actually happen at night and

819.519 --> 826.48
then I'm just not really even thinking

823.32 --> 829.6
about I'm just moving through it I'm not

826.48 --> 829.6
even like recording

829.959 --> 835.4799999999999
anything but sometimes I do wish I would

832.48 --> 838.0790000000001
make more notes but you can't really

835.48 --> 841.04
make a note of like a very complicated

838.079 --> 841.04
esoteric point

842.36 --> 852.36
sometimes you can only experience it

847.0 --> 852.36
anyway getting ready for the heat wave

854.839 --> 861.8800000000001
okay

856.519 --> 865.519
huh so I guess it's not just

861.88 --> 869.4399999999999
here that's nice I guess I think I don't

865.519 --> 874.279
know how bad the heat waves get

869.44 --> 877.839
but I mean you're like pretty far in the

874.279 --> 880.8389999999999
north so it should be manageable right

877.839 --> 883.399
it's not like you're in Arizona or Texas

880.839 --> 883.399
somewhere or

891.72 --> 897.519
something right but yeah the summer

894.0 --> 901.04
might finally arrive properly here in

897.519 --> 901.04
the north part of the rail

907.399 --> 911.839
and I

908.68 --> 914.6389999999999
will certainly enjoy it and not let

911.839 --> 918.399
whatever craziness on it out there in

914.639 --> 921.16
the world I'm not going to let that ruin

918.399 --> 924.16
it only thing that could probably ruin

921.16 --> 927.24
it is that it just completely run out of

924.16 --> 929.88
money and then I won't have enough money

927.24 --> 931.72
to buy my new jacket that I really need

929.88 --> 935.12
because the old one is just F

931.72 --> 938.3190000000001
disintegrating so rapidly now like it's

935.12 --> 938.319
not going to hold another

938.88 --> 943.279
year like it's literally falling apart

941.839 --> 946.72
at the

943.279 --> 949.56
seems and like having it repaired is

946.72 --> 952.0400000000001
expensive like it's it would be cheaper

949.56 --> 954.5999999999999
to just get a new one but yeah you still

952.04 --> 957.88
have to have substantial amount of money

954.6 --> 957.88
for that

959.639 --> 964.399
right but I don't know maybe I'll get

961.36 --> 967.639
lucky may maybe I'll

964.399 --> 970.0
manage but yeah any donations to my

967.639 --> 975.44
PayPal would certainly help

970.0 --> 975.44
out for me enabling me to get a new

978.88 --> 986.04
jacket right but yeah we'll see what

982.48 --> 989.9590000000001
happens maybe when everybody gets back

986.04 --> 991.959
after the summer holiday period

989.959 --> 995.3599999999999
everybody gets more active then maybe

991.959 --> 996.959
I'll I'll try to get one then it's not

995.36 --> 998.72
like if it's going to be hot it's not

996.959 --> 1001.199
like I'm going to be needing it a lot of

998.72 --> 1001.1990000000001
the time

1002.199 --> 1008.4399999999999
anyway

1005.16 --> 1011.12
right but uh yeah that Financial

1008.44 --> 1015.0
realization probably also contributed to

1011.12 --> 1015.0
my crankiness yesterday

1019.76 --> 1022.86
[Music]

1023.76 --> 1028.319
uh but at least my dad was doing

1029.12 --> 1038.52
great oh my God I have to do something

1032.36 --> 1038.52
about this flies really agitating

1060.039 --> 1066.2
I'll get you next time fly next time

1082.159 --> 1086.5200000000002
right but yeah my dad's doing

1088.159 --> 1094.6000000000001
great it's the football season now again

1092.12 --> 1097.52
so like all over the place there

1094.6 --> 1100.6
people like I realized that oh is

1097.52 --> 1103.84
Football starting again probably because

1100.6 --> 1107.6
certain people just like go orange nuts

1103.84 --> 1110.08
start hanging orange Flags everywhere

1107.6 --> 1114.32
and like in the

1110.08 --> 1116.0
streets in certain places and I mean I'm

1114.32 --> 1119.24
perfectly fine with

1116.0 --> 1121.44
that it's kind of funny any a way that

1119.24 --> 1125.32
Dutch yeah that that's kind of a Dutch

1121.44 --> 1125.3200000000002
thing with the common

1128.32 --> 1134.9189999999999
folk but uh yeah I did even actually

1132.08 --> 1134.9189999999999
watch some

1134.96 --> 1139.48
football but I mean

1143.12 --> 1146.1589999999999
watching it without

1146.52 --> 1152.08
beer it's not super riveting I mean

1150.039 --> 1153.8799999999999
sometimes it's a little bit interesting

1152.08 --> 1156.08
there's some tension happening and

1153.88 --> 1164.7600000000002
everybody like really starts to make

1156.08 --> 1164.76
effort but overall like yeah n

1169.0 --> 1176.32
but yeah I I'll probably like check out

1172.44 --> 1179.44
football schedules and regularly and

1176.32 --> 1183.0
whatever just to see what's going

1179.44 --> 1185.72
on like if there's one sport I have a

1183.0 --> 1188.679
little bit of weakness for it's that I

1185.72 --> 1190.039
mean others I just really don't don't

1188.679 --> 1194.76
care at

1190.039 --> 1198.72
all but soccer or football like yeah

1194.76 --> 1201.28
when there's some like championship in

1198.72 --> 1204.039
International thing I usually it it just

1201.28 --> 1207.52
catches my attention and well also all

1204.039 --> 1210.12
the people hanging out the flags and

1207.52 --> 1212.6399999999999
everything so it'll be in your face one

1210.12 --> 1212.6399999999999
way or the

1219.0 --> 1228.96
other and it's a also a bit of a way to

1223.2 --> 1233.0800000000002
check like how bad the uh

1228.96 --> 1236.08
the woke agenda influence is has

1233.08 --> 1238.96
gotten and thus far it it doesn't seem

1236.08 --> 1242.039
to be uh all that

1238.96 --> 1245.4
terrible except for some football

1242.039 --> 1248.919
players that just wear these Pink Shoes

1245.4 --> 1253.8400000000001
it's like H

1248.919 --> 1253.8400000000001
why I don't want to know why

1264.24 --> 1267.919
right so that's

1276.679 --> 1279.96
happening people out there working on

1279.0 --> 1284.36
their

1279.96 --> 1287.3600000000001
house as uh you can hear that's

1284.36 --> 1287.36
happening

1301.2 --> 1306.52
I was watching

1302.64 --> 1310.0800000000002
a Quantum of conscience on freevoice

1306.52 --> 1313.32
doio reviewing like very old series from

1310.08 --> 1316.039
the 70s The

1313.32 --> 1320.52
Prisoner or

1316.039 --> 1320.52
60s very odd

1321.48 --> 1328.0
it's it's really interesting to actually

1324.08 --> 1330.24
watch that review because I was like my

1328.0 --> 1333.96
face was pushed into that

1330.24 --> 1335.679
series way back and I just couldn't get

1333.96 --> 1339.08
through it at all I thought it was

1335.679 --> 1339.0800000000002
extremely tedious and

1340.84 --> 1347.8799999999999
confusing but uh yeah it's it's good to

1345.08 --> 1350.12
actually see a review from Quantum of

1347.88 --> 1353.96
conscious who's like way

1350.12 --> 1357.4799999999998
more focused because when I bumped into

1353.96 --> 1360.4
it first I was like I didn't really want

1357.48 --> 1362.1200000000001
to watch it it's just like oh here's

1360.4 --> 1363.039
these mysterious hints you're getting

1362.12 --> 1365.52
from

1363.039 --> 1370.76
somebody and just watch this and it's

1365.52 --> 1374.8799999999999
like G tedious

1370.76 --> 1378.72
old I did not really have that more

1374.88 --> 1381.72
sharp conspiracy mind back then I mean

1378.72 --> 1384.0
has basically taken me 20 years to be

1381.72 --> 1384.0
like

1384.039 --> 1390.44
this also it was pre Alex Jones era I

1387.96 --> 1393.24
mean Alex Jones popping into my

1390.44 --> 1396.159
attention like that he really laid the

1393.24 --> 1396.159
ground Works in

1396.48 --> 1401.4
ways for me to get focused and and it's

1399.4 --> 1405.24
kind of funny

1401.4 --> 1410.44
because the what I now regard as fear

1405.24 --> 1410.44
porn sides where just

1411.799 --> 1420.52
like put together like the maximum bad

1416.88 --> 1422.679
outcome type situations and like hold

1420.52 --> 1426.76
that over you as like oh you should fear

1422.679 --> 1431.3600000000001
this like that now is something that I

1426.76 --> 1431.36
just regard as fear porn but back

1432.039 --> 1437.72
then that thing did kind of shake me

1435.279 --> 1440.24
awoke like it did scare the [ __ ] out of

1437.72 --> 1444.559
me and and that

1440.24 --> 1448.1200000000001
like it ripped me out of my comfort

1444.559 --> 1453.279
zone and it was kind of

1448.12 --> 1456.6789999999999
traumatic but that forced me to get

1453.279 --> 1459.72
sharper because before that I just was

1456.679 --> 1462.96
like oh yeah cons I was just he he

1459.72 --> 1465.799
actually awoke my interest in

1462.96 --> 1468.159
conspiracy because of that it's it's

1465.799 --> 1470.6399999999999
weird but I have to be honest about it

1468.159 --> 1473.1200000000001
and that's why I'm not like oh Alex

1470.64 --> 1476.039
Jones bad is only feir poor don't watch

1473.12 --> 1476.039
it because

1476.399 --> 1479.6
no

1477.919 --> 1482.5200000000002
yes

1479.6 --> 1485.84
eventually you should probably start

1482.52 --> 1488.039
seeing it like that but for beginners it

1485.84 --> 1490.039
has a very unique effect and I

1488.039 --> 1493.2
personally experienced

1490.039 --> 1494.44
that cuz he was the original catalst to

1493.2 --> 1497.679
really wake me

1494.44 --> 1499.44
up Beyond just being interested in in

1497.679 --> 1500.8400000000001
odity

1499.44 --> 1504.52
things that

1500.84 --> 1506.8799999999999
like you never hear of interest in the

1504.52 --> 1507.72
occult effectively CU that's where that

1506.88 --> 1510.5200000000002
all

1507.72 --> 1513.96
started but then the fear porn basically

1510.52 --> 1516.12
drew me in and just it did sharpen me up

1513.96 --> 1519.3600000000001
it also appeals to a lot of like

1516.12 --> 1522.1589999999999
defensive instincts which I have

1519.36 --> 1525.24
strongly and have always found had a lot

1522.159 --> 1528.7600000000002
of trouble integrating those instincts

1525.24 --> 1530.36
into whatever

1528.76 --> 1533.919
wherever I

1530.36 --> 1536.8799999999999
am and he actually managed to

1533.919 --> 1540.679
basically put those instincts

1536.88 --> 1544.279
together with the Awakening and the

1540.679 --> 1546.5590000000002
focus of because of the fear porn and

1544.279 --> 1550.799
managed

1546.559 --> 1550.799
to create that for me

1552.0 --> 1557.919
psychologically hey oron wumble and Moxy

1558.48 --> 1564.44
breast cancer oh God all right ARA

1572.18 --> 1575.219
[Music]

1581.039 --> 1586.8799999999999
kumble people you know who I am but you

1584.52 --> 1590.24
don't know why I am here

1586.88 --> 1590.24
what okay

1596.64 --> 1604.5590000000002
right I just wanted to do my honest view

1601.279 --> 1608.44
on it like Alex Jones I keep watching

1604.559 --> 1612.6
him I do complain about fear porn I do

1608.44 --> 1616.0
definitely make fun of his persistent

1612.6 --> 1618.52
ability to un interrupt his guests

1616.0 --> 1621.48
continually because

1618.52 --> 1625.12
after watching it for this long yes it's

1621.48 --> 1628.039
literally funny how compulsive he is in

1625.12 --> 1632.399
interrupting like his guests halfway

1628.039 --> 1635.64
sentences like he does it always there's

1632.399 --> 1639.0
only just very few people who kind of

1635.64 --> 1642.039
like negate

1639.0 --> 1645.64
that like this guy Jack bovich I think

1642.039 --> 1649.559
it is he's like he

1645.64 --> 1651.96
just like tames that

1649.559 --> 1655.72
effect whenever they're on together and

1651.96 --> 1659.08
it frustrates is Alex like but it's yeah

1655.72 --> 1662.679
this is just behavioral things right and

1659.08 --> 1664.76
that's for me personally like a field of

1662.679 --> 1666.8400000000001
interest because I am very interested in

1664.76 --> 1668.32
behavior in general and psychology

1666.84 --> 1670.559
that's kind of my specialty that's what

1668.32 --> 1670.559
it's

1671.0 --> 1677.72
become but that part is like really

1673.399 --> 1678.9189999999999
funny to me like you know it's real Alex

1677.72 --> 1681.24
Jones

1678.919 --> 1683.7990000000002
by how much he interrupts his guest like

1681.24 --> 1685.96
if that ever stops that's when you have

1683.799 --> 1689.399
to be seriously suspicious that there's

1685.96 --> 1692.3600000000001
some kind of AI forgery happening

1689.399 --> 1695.6399999999999
because you know it's Alex Jones because

1692.36 --> 1697.1589999999999
he like really compulsively interrupts

1695.64 --> 1700.2
his

1697.159 --> 1704.88
guess and to me that's kind of

1700.2 --> 1709.559
funny and I'm not like angry at him like

1704.88 --> 1712.24
it's just his quirk

1709.559 --> 1714.32
did I watch Owen Benjamin yet

1712.24 --> 1716.799
what I didn't know there was Owen

1714.32 --> 1716.799
Benjamin

1718.08 --> 1723.9189999999999
yesterday sun and shadows good and evil

1721.88 --> 1726.88
oh wait yeah that's from

1723.919 --> 1730.679
Friday the Friday show yeah yeah

1726.88 --> 1735.0390000000002
yeah yeah he had a lot of gravy back

1730.679 --> 1737.64
then also talking about Sweden like

1735.039 --> 1739.84
basically the Swedish powers and all

1737.64 --> 1742.5590000000002
that and it's always kind of creepy when

1739.84 --> 1745.32
he brings that up and things always get

1742.559 --> 1747.2
graveled so the actual live stream was

1745.32 --> 1748.8799999999999
like continually getting interrupted and

1747.2 --> 1752.44
all that very

1748.88 --> 1754.88
annoying but the subjects were

1752.44 --> 1758.0
intense so that's probably the show you

1754.88 --> 1762.0800000000002
were talking about cuz first part was

1758.0 --> 1762.08
about that and second part

1762.159 --> 1768.519
about esoteric symbolism of light and

1765.32 --> 1771.32
Shadow and good and evil indeed

1768.519 --> 1772.72
so yeah I did watch that LSG but I

1771.32 --> 1774.96
watched that

1772.72 --> 1775.42
Friday didn't really get to talking

1774.96 --> 1778.66
about

1775.42 --> 1778.66
[Music]

noise is somebody working in their house

drilling or

1900.559 --> 1906.639
whatever and the other noise was me

1903.48 --> 1911.44
typing in Skype with the bable D who for

1906.639 --> 1911.4399999999998
some reason still can't show up in my

1914.0 --> 1919.84
chat but it's kind of nice to just have

1917.08 --> 1919.84
contact

1921.36 --> 1929.639
cuz debatable D is not a bad

1924.72 --> 1929.6390000000001
person and I think I

1931.0 --> 1937.799
sometimes was a bit paranoid about

1934.08 --> 1941.0
her anyway hey clutch good to see

1937.799 --> 1941.0
you good

1941.12 --> 1944.6789999999999
morning what the

1944.88 --> 1948.3990000000001
apps yeah you missed that part that's

1947.12 --> 1950.76
what I

1948.399 --> 1953.4799999999998
I have been doing that right before you

1950.76 --> 1953.48
came in pretty

1961.6 --> 1966.6789999999999
much Ah that's a good one someone's

1964.679 --> 1969.159
about to explain something and they

1966.679 --> 1971.48
place a briefcase on the table there a

1969.159 --> 1976.3990000000001
good chance it's not going to be

1971.48 --> 1976.3990000000001
brief that's very clever LSG

1986.0 --> 1992.399
you could even improve on that by saying

1987.96 --> 1996.08
if somebody's about to explain a case to

1992.399 --> 1997.9599999999998
you and they're placing a briefcase on

1996.08 --> 2000.279
the table there a good chance it's not

1997.96 --> 2003.279
going to be brief see now you have the

2000.279 --> 2003.279
symmetry

2026.36 --> 2033.08
what WCW what what are you talking about

2030.08 --> 2033.08
clutch

2040.639 --> 2044.7199999999998
what the hell does that mean

2099.25 --> 2102.28
[Music]

2113.76 --> 2118.6400000000003
wrestling

2115.599 --> 2124.96
what okay so

2118.64 --> 2124.96
I some product W i' never heard of

2125.599 --> 2133.52
WCW clutch

2129.4 --> 2136.52
so maybe that's like a Canadian or an

2133.52 --> 2136.52
American

2149.8 --> 2155.599
thing yeah what Moxy said does sound

2152.599 --> 2155.599
like it could be an

2156.64 --> 2160.48
ad hello Shan

2168.2 --> 2175.04
G oh my God

2171.68 --> 2175.04
no [ __ ]

2177.839 --> 2186.72
wrestling okay talking about wit that

2181.76 --> 2186.7200000000003
was weird yesterday there there was

2188.92 --> 2195.56
Sunday Night Live Infowars although the

2192.359 --> 2199.04
rumble stream that's normally there is

2195.56 --> 2203.319
down again so I had to watch it

2199.04 --> 2207.599
on band. video but they did actually say

2203.319 --> 2209.119
something really weird ohen tro said

2207.599 --> 2212.2000000000003
that

2209.119 --> 2217.92
apparently Hulk

2212.2 --> 2221.48
Hogan might run for VP with trumpets

2217.92 --> 2224.7200000000003
so I guess that's wrestling related news

2221.48 --> 2228.0
and yes that really really feels like

2224.72 --> 2231.52
idiocracy when you think about

2228.0 --> 2231.52
that that is

2234.76 --> 2240.119
uncanny but uh yeah I didn't really want

2237.64 --> 2241.839
to talk about wrestling but since I

2240.119 --> 2247.6800000000003
bumped into

2241.839 --> 2247.68
that I'll Overlook it just this once

2273.4 --> 2279.839

2280.16 --> 2287.319
e all right learned another thing that I

2284.88 --> 2289.52
did not really want to know

2287.319 --> 2292.04
but

2289.52 --> 2295.319

[Music]

2387.4 --> 2393.839
I was a big wrestling fan until I wasn't

2390.359 --> 2398.319
I was never a really big wrestling

2393.839 --> 2398.319
fan but I was

2399.64 --> 2407.2
distracted by it in certain periods like

2403.24 --> 2409.4799999999996
when I was like on beer and weed and

2407.2 --> 2412.8799999999997
like Yay dumb

2409.48 --> 2414.76
party I was very ENT entertained by The

2412.88 --> 2419.2400000000002
Ultimate

2414.76 --> 2425.0
Warrior is so ridiculous like but

2419.24 --> 2425.0
like I liked how crazy that guy

2425.24 --> 2431.839
was now retrospect is it's all very gay

2428.64 --> 2435.2799999999997
and all that and like

2431.839 --> 2438.7999999999997
yeah but I was there like watching a

2435.28 --> 2442.2400000000002
little bit in like the late

2438.8 --> 2445.28
90s so I did get to see some Hulk Hogan

2442.24 --> 2448.56
stuff still and Ultimate Warrior that

2445.28 --> 2452.119
phase I mean it was very exciting in a

2448.56 --> 2455.44
way it was relatively fresh something

2452.119 --> 2458.4
going on like Andre the Giant and like I

2455.44 --> 2459.68
still remember all those characters

2458.4 --> 2463.52
but I mean

2459.68 --> 2465.44
after after that after a while was like

2463.52 --> 2467.7599999999998
none of those characters are still there

2465.44 --> 2469.56
and I was just like yeah [ __ ] this I

2467.76 --> 2472.5200000000004
don't give a [ __ ] about these new

2469.56 --> 2472.52
characters at

2475.4 --> 2482.28
all like the newer characters are

2478.56 --> 2483.88
not into it as much because that's what

2482.28 --> 2486.2000000000003
what made it so interesting the

2483.88 --> 2489.599
wrestling is that they were just all so

2486.2 --> 2491.56
into it they were so suspended into that

2489.599 --> 2496.839
character making it real even though

2491.56 --> 2499.52
it's all and fake and after that

2496.839 --> 2501.68
period it just wasn't the same really

2499.52 --> 2503.64
and I just was not interested anymore

2501.68 --> 2505.7999999999997
and then I figured out afterward like

2503.64 --> 2508.359
how incredibly fake it really is I never

2505.8 --> 2509.92
even realized it was that bad thought

2508.359 --> 2512.88
that some of it was

2509.92 --> 2516.88
real but it's basically just the

2512.88 --> 2516.88
theater anyway

2519.52 --> 2522.079
or

2525.64 --> 2532.8199999999997
yours I take umage with it being

gay right

2532.82 --> 2536.07
[Music]

2559.119 --> 2563.4
people are always injured

2565.599 --> 2568.96

2575.72 --> 2580.9199999999996
no I mean the can get injured if things

2578.96 --> 2582.92
go wrong but I

2580.92 --> 2585.4
mean don't know what you're talking

2582.92 --> 2585.4
about there

2587.28 --> 2590.28
clutch

2599.119 --> 2606.04
uh action movies rest yeah you got a

2602.48 --> 2606.04
point there clutch

2634.16 --> 2638.5589999999997
okay all right I'm going to take a bite

2636.319 --> 2640.8
on my Illuminati s before it gets cold

2638.559 --> 2640.8
so

2666.04 --> 2670.079
cheers for

2724.28 --> 2731.88
okay so can we now actually move on

2728.88 --> 2731.88
know

2761.359 --> 2763.92
what I

2764.44 --> 2769.839
got nobody cares

2767.319 --> 2772.04
Moxy what I got well I don't have

2769.839 --> 2774.96
anything but I just don't want to end up

2772.04 --> 2777.92
talking about wrestling thanks yeah

2774.96 --> 2780.0
that's the issue that I have I mean it's

2777.92 --> 2782.119
fine if you bring up a little it's just

2780.0 --> 2784.92
I don't want to talk about that just

2782.119 --> 2788.92
because there's no direct other subject

2784.92 --> 2788.92
even though I brought up tons

2814.04 --> 2820.0
before don't like action movies either

2817.68 --> 2822.72
I liked action movies when I was younger

2820.0 --> 2825.72
but yeah these days I'm not interested

2822.72 --> 2825.72
in that

2829.44 --> 2837.359
much I did like tenet though because it

2833.64 --> 2840.4
has strong SciFi elements to it and

2837.359 --> 2841.2
like that is technically mostly an

2840.4 --> 2844.2000000000003
action

2841.2 --> 2846.2799999999997
movie but because of the Sci-Fi elements

2844.2 --> 2848.839
so eloquently done it made it super

2846.28 --> 2848.8390000000004
interesting

2848.88 --> 2854.52
but yeah in general just action movies

2857.079 --> 2862.3590000000004
nah but sometimes it's like just kind of

2860.119 --> 2865.839
a thing that you watch just because of

2862.359 --> 2870.119
it because of its distracting

2865.839 --> 2870.119
qualities as it were

2901.2 --> 2908.7599999999998
Man by the way I'm like going through

2904.4 --> 2908.76
Star Trek Voyager series

2908.92 --> 2914.48
entered sixth

2911.64 --> 2918.04
season and like

2914.48 --> 2920.319
damn how incredibly chalk full is this

2918.04 --> 2922.839
series I mean there's so much that

2920.319 --> 2925.88
actually happens in

2922.839 --> 2928.359
there it's just a a

2925.88 --> 2930.319
great

2928.359 --> 2933.4
Scala of

2930.319 --> 2936.359
things and it's

2933.4 --> 2938.7200000000003
very varied it's a it's just super

2936.359 --> 2938.72
varied

2942.359 --> 2949.16
and like even the the type of directions

2945.48 --> 2952.64
they take is just very widespread from

2949.16 --> 2956.319
like completely spiritual surreal

2952.64 --> 2960.5989999999997
experiences to like thinking of it as

2956.319 --> 2962.92
Spirit entities and psionics and like

2960.599 --> 2966.1600000000003
there's all these different types of

2962.92 --> 2968.64
models of approach that they utilize

2966.16 --> 2972.04
depending on the episode I mean

2968.64 --> 2975.72
basically one episode it works in a

2972.04 --> 2978.5589999999997
very classical spiritual

2975.72 --> 2979.48
way and then another time it works much

2978.559 --> 2982.6800000000003
more

2979.48 --> 2985.64
mechanical in a sci-fi-ish way it's it's

2982.68 --> 2988.5989999999997
really interesting looking at it also

2985.64 --> 2991.64
because if you're not super well versed

2988.599 --> 2996.2000000000003
at these kind of things you don't

2991.64 --> 2996.2
necessarily understand the difference

2997.76 --> 3005.079
it's just very

3000.76 --> 3005.079
rich in stuff happening in

3006.079 --> 3009.079
there

3012.599 --> 3019.3590000000004
anyway you work with a lot of tools

3015.799 --> 3019.359
can't figure out

3029.839 --> 3036.2799999999997
it sounds like a uh one of those saws

3033.839 --> 3038.92
right a machine that has like

3036.28 --> 3041.6400000000003
saw it sounds like it's just cutting

3038.92 --> 3041.64
stuff a

3052.599 --> 3057.839
lot hey Kevlar good see you

3059.319 --> 3066.0
thanks for all of you to actually show

3061.04 --> 3066.0
up here I appreciate that

3082.05 --> 3085.159
[Music]

3087.92 --> 3103.01
[Music]

3109.16 --> 3123.67
what oh wow

3111.98 --> 3123.67
[Music]

3127.67 --> 3132.79
[Music]

3146.98 --> 3151.28
[Music]

3160.319 --> 3166.68
what do I think of the final

3163.52 --> 3169.2
experiment I think uh the name is

3166.68 --> 3170.96
misplaced I don't think it is a final

3169.2 --> 3174.16
experiment at

3170.96 --> 3178.44
all neither is it an

3174.16 --> 3178.44
experiment it's a test

3184.599 --> 3190.48
it's a test based on observing nature

3187.04 --> 3190.48
and that's it

3210.359 --> 3213.4
when he talks like

3214.0 --> 3217.0
that

3221.28 --> 3227.0400000000004
yeah I don't know man I don't see the

3223.76 --> 3231.7200000000003
point though in just like

3227.04 --> 3233.68
hi I'm this troll like uh so you're not

3231.72 --> 3236.4399999999996
even going to try to infiltrate me

3233.68 --> 3240.1189999999997
anymore you're just going to immediately

3236.44 --> 3242.48
R yourself you just are sounds like some

3240.119 --> 3244.52
people aren't even here to be

3242.48 --> 3246.44
infiltrated they're just here because

3244.52 --> 3250.48
they get a kick out of me Banning them

3246.44 --> 3250.48
or something I don't get

3263.68 --> 3269.48
it the boys from Brazil yeah I have that

3267.559 --> 3273.799
movie on my uh

3269.48 --> 3273.799
computer it's a bit tedious

3287.319 --> 3294.52
though I don't remember the details I

3289.96 --> 3294.52
just know it's like about weird

3294.92 --> 3302.44
Nazis it's B basically a hint at a

3298.92 --> 3305.16
general hint like at for example Project

3302.44 --> 3307.359
Paperclip that just the Nazis are still

3305.16 --> 3308.7599999999998
there that's basically what that movie

3307.359 --> 3315.0
is

3308.76 --> 3315.0
like book was better right I'm sure it

3325.319 --> 3329.2799999999997
was for

3376.76 --> 3382.3590000000004
huh I completely forgot about that

3379.359 --> 3382.359
clutch

3388.0 --> 3394.68
yeah now that you're saying that it's

3389.52 --> 3394.68
like oh yeah indeed like cloning Hitler

3396.359 --> 3399.92
weird freaky

3415.24 --> 3419.2
movie for

3455.88 --> 3458.88
h

3480.24 --> 3484.799
ah sounds like the sawing is finally

3482.48 --> 3486.76
over that's just a bunch of hammering

3484.799 --> 3489.599
but that's not that

3486.76 --> 3494.96
loud

3489.599 --> 3494.96
cool that did actually distract me a

3496.65 --> 3499.76
[Music]

3504.359 --> 3509.43
lot trying to figure out out if there's

3506.64 --> 3514.019
something I could talk

3509.43 --> 3514.019
[Music]

3535.039 --> 3539.079
about for

3580.839 --> 3587.48
I think there's

3582.2 --> 3589.5989999999997
like Flat Earth Festival and flat earth

3587.48 --> 3595.039
related festivals out

3589.599 --> 3598.76
there is this thing I John Thor had

3595.039 --> 3601.44
some called it anara

3598.76 --> 3604.8390000000004
Poco anybody heard of

3601.44 --> 3606.64
that have no idea what that is but it

3604.839 --> 3609.359
did sound like it's just some kind of

3606.64 --> 3609.359
festival

3613.24 --> 3619.799
thing and it's probably really

3615.68 --> 3619.799
libertarian or something

3638.799 --> 3646.119
what increase in

3642.16 --> 3646.1189999999997
EVS what what is an

3647.52 --> 3651.24
EV electric

3652.4 --> 3657.1600000000003
vehicles is that what you mean

3659.48 --> 3666.799
yes okay yeah there's tons of

3663.28 --> 3670.1600000000003
them I mean have been for a

3666.799 --> 3673.799
while lots of

3670.16 --> 3676.16
them there's like a electric vehicle St

3673.799 --> 3679.359
charging station right at the corner of

3676.16 --> 3679.359
this building

3704.2 --> 3710.1189999999997
a free one what what do you mean a free

3713.2 --> 3721.24
one upgrading an electric assist

3716.48 --> 3721.2400000000002
go well how about a new jacket

3748.119 --> 3753.6800000000003
not an electric jacket no just a new

3755.89 --> 3759.02
[Music]

3764.039 --> 3770.119
jacket an electric jacket sounds like

3766.92 --> 3772.52
nice if I go to Antarctica or some other

3770.119 --> 3774.2000000000003
incredibly cold place yeah then electric

3772.52 --> 3776.7599999999998
jacket sounds

3774.2 --> 3778.839
awesome but uh

3776.76 --> 3782.2000000000003
I wasn't planning on going to any super

3778.839 --> 3786.5589999999997
cold place I just need a new jacket so

3782.2 --> 3786.5589999999997
yeah electric bike oh yeah

3787.319 --> 3795.0389999999998
no I mean I have a bicycle that's

3792.039 --> 3796.7990000000004
relatively new recent like in April I

3795.039 --> 3800.1600000000003
had to get a new one because the old one

3796.799 --> 3805.4
was just broken too

3800.16 --> 3807.16
much yeah electric bicycles uh no like

3805.4 --> 3810.92
how the H am I going to afford that

3807.16 --> 3813.799
anyway and why like the only thing that

3810.92 --> 3817.16
it means is that I can't park my bike

3813.799 --> 3820.16
outside anymore because it'll get

3817.16 --> 3820.16
stolen

3825.279 --> 3831.839
great the jacket from Back to the

3829.24 --> 3834.319
Future

3831.839 --> 3837.72
right you can cover more ground well I

3834.319 --> 3837.72
don't need to cover more ground

3849.88 --> 3854.5190000000002

[Music]

4131.88 --> 4135.88
or yeah

4137.679 --> 4140.759
it was annoying

4144.6 --> 4153.04
though parts of it I like the whole

4148.48 --> 4156.04
gender fluid trans [ __ ] in there was

4153.04 --> 4156.04
terrifying

4157.48 --> 4163.919999999999
gross so it was basically like a gay

4160.359 --> 4166.92
Star Trek I mean that part of it I did

4163.92 --> 4173.2390000000005
not really like but I I mean as an

4166.92 --> 4173.2390000000005
overall setup it was like yeah sure

4175.979 --> 4190.648
[Music]

4200.239 --> 4207.32
I mean yeah I kind of liked it but it

4203.199 --> 4207.32
was very gay though that's

4211.28 --> 4215.999
[Music]

4217.12 --> 4221.92
annoying oh my God

4230.22 --> 4233.93

4239.679 --> 4242.679

4312.96 --> 4319.44
is the good finger waving how

4316.6 --> 4322.1990000000005
rude talking about which just Rens up

4319.44 --> 4324.599999999999
the show and yeah I'd love to start

4322.199 --> 4328.919999999999
talking about something unless this is

4324.6 --> 4328.92
just what you guys want

4330.36 --> 4333.839999999999
just hanging

4335.76 --> 4341.719
around that's all fine if that's what

4338.28 --> 4341.719
you guys want

4355.48 --> 4359.879999999999
all right anyway I'll be right back two

4374.12 --> 4378.159
minutes for

4435.08 --> 4438.08
e

4477.32 --> 4483.759999999999
okay let's look at through his stuff

4480.88 --> 4483.76
yeah very funny

4490.04 --> 4495.96
keplar My Show Take the Lead okay fine

4504.04 --> 4508.96
has anybody been thinking about what I

4506.719 --> 4510.8
talked about with the whole gas pressure

4508.96 --> 4516.2390000000005
without a container

4510.8 --> 4519.84
test container within the container

4516.239 --> 4522.239
gradiation within the internal

4519.84 --> 4525.88
container gas pressure gradiation

4522.239 --> 4529.28
through cold and heat element and then

4525.88 --> 4531.8
unleashing it through a hole on the cold

4529.28 --> 4534.08
side where there's lower pressure to a

4531.8 --> 4536.679
bigger chamber that is of equal pressure

4534.08 --> 4537.679
as the lower pressure side of the

4536.679 --> 4540.6
internal

4537.679 --> 4542.96
container and then see what

4540.6 --> 4544.360000000001
happens and you remove the barrier

4542.96 --> 4548.679
between

4544.36 --> 4550.36
two places where the pressure is

4548.679 --> 4552.96
technically the

4550.36 --> 4555.96
same yeah remember that I brought that

4552.96 --> 4558.28
up like nobody ever fre mentions or

4555.96 --> 4560.4800000000005
references anything that I bring up like

4558.28 --> 4562.84
that I mean

4560.48 --> 4564.759999999999
it's this is the type of thing that I

4562.84 --> 4569.4400000000005
talk

4564.76 --> 4569.4400000000005
about but no you want to talk about

4583.04 --> 4587.56
wrestling did I set up the new monitor

4586.239 --> 4592.4
yet

4587.56 --> 4592.400000000001
nope still standing by

4621.239 --> 4629.199
but yeah I will probably install it

4625.28 --> 4632.48
soon as yeah this older monitor is like

4629.199 --> 4632.48
it is glitching more

4634.48 --> 4641.28
often but I mean it's still fine and I'm

4637.36 --> 4641.28
kind of used to it and I never really

4641.32 --> 4647.96
like discarding all equipment unless it

4644.56 --> 4650.159000000001
l breaks down it's just something that's

4647.96 --> 4652.52
against my nature at this

4650.159 --> 4655.32
point

4652.52 --> 4657.52
so it's like I want to give it another

4655.32 --> 4660.12
chance before I replace

4657.52 --> 4662.84
it but I'm pretty sure it's it's

4660.12 --> 4664.8
probably going to like get really

4662.84 --> 4668.88
tedious soon

4664.8 --> 4668.88
so then I'll just switch it

4673.84 --> 4677.8
out for

[Music]

4728.6 --> 4732.8
this shit's going to be there tomorrow

4730.48 --> 4736.4
exactly like this I'm probably going to

4732.8 --> 4739.12
like not do a show for a while

4736.4 --> 4741.199
cuz seriously that

4739.12 --> 4744.199
noise is

4741.199 --> 4746.199
unbelievably concentration disruptive to

4744.199 --> 4748.919999999999
me I mean you guys probably don't hear

4746.199 --> 4748.919999999999
too much of

4749.12 --> 4755.36
it compared to what I get to hear just

4752.92 --> 4758.159
it goes right through

4755.36 --> 4764.199
you so I wouldn't be able to concentrate

4758.159 --> 4764.199
like this at all very freaking tedious

4775.36 --> 4781.04
[Music]

4777.36 --> 4781.04
what Steven Jarvis

4822.48 --> 4826.61
[Music]

4827.159 --> 4830.5599999999995
right I think I'm just going to it's

4828.96 --> 4832.92
very

4830.56 --> 4834.92
unusual but I mean there's not a lot

4832.92 --> 4838.4
happening I'd love to engage I'm just

4834.92 --> 4841.159
going to like roll a regular

4838.4 --> 4841.799999999999
smoke not going to smoke it on camera by

4841.159 --> 4846.839999999999
the

4841.8 --> 4846.84
way I'll just get out get some fresh

4847.12 --> 4850.8
air we see what

4851.92 --> 4856.639
happens maybe this is just it

4861.44 --> 4866.839999999999
I don't know how to take the lead if

4863.76 --> 4869.1990000000005
nobody will take the lead I bring up a

4866.84 --> 4873.679
subject that's really what this is show

4869.199 --> 4876.32
about guess what happens nobody

4873.679 --> 4880.04
responds so apparently this is not a

4876.32 --> 4882.36
workshop anymore apparently you all

4880.04 --> 4885.0
collectively subconsciously decide that

4882.36 --> 4885.92
this is not a workshop this is just you

4885.0 --> 4889.0
on

4885.92 --> 4891.1990000000005
vacation and sure trolls are still not

4889.0 --> 4893.8
welcome but I mean this is not a

4891.199 --> 4893.799999999999
workshop

4894.88 --> 4899.04
anymore I guess that that time is over

4897.56 --> 4901.84
maybe it's just not the right time of

4899.04 --> 4904.0
the year I'm sure you're all be like oh

4901.84 --> 4906.639
this is a workshop

4904.0 --> 4908.159
suddenly in September or something

4906.639 --> 4910.8
whenever that's going to

4908.159 --> 4912.839999999999
be and then suddenly it's like oh your

4910.8 --> 4915.159000000001
memories come back like oh we're

4912.84 --> 4917.159000000001
supposed to be like this right

4915.159 --> 4920.32
but I think that I don't know you're all

4917.159 --> 4922.879999999999
in just summer vacation mode or whatever

4920.32 --> 4926.08
this Workshop is under construction yeah

4922.88 --> 4926.08
that's a good one very

4926.8 --> 4931.159000000001
funny fair enough

4931.38 --> 4938.62
[Music]

4970.48 --> 4976.44

is you're going to have to find that on

4990.52 --> 4994.88
Nathan Oakley's Channel I did notice

4992.679 --> 4998.679

4994.88 --> 4998.679
this title out

5000.12 --> 5004.12

5005.96 --> 5011.12

5075.199 --> 5078.919999999999
I mean I can go fish the link for you if

5077.56 --> 5081.719

5093.87 --> 5098.539
[Music]

5102.119 --> 5105.759999999999
this panel is about gone yeah well it's

5104.639 --> 5108.76
because it's

5105.76 --> 5108.76
summertime

5109.639 --> 5115.2390000000005
klar I took the

5112.28 --> 5118.719
lead no it has nothing to do with that

5115.239 --> 5122.879999999999
they're not all gone in protest as far

5118.719 --> 5122.88
as I know it's just

5123.199 --> 5128.759999999999
summertime that that

5125.84 --> 5131.159000000001
happens I mean we had that every summer

5128.76 --> 5133.92
when it was still there yeah I would

5131.159 --> 5136.119
actually be on Nathan Oakley and talk

5133.92 --> 5138.28
about my [ __ ] and Nathan would let me

5136.119 --> 5140.88
because literally almost nobody else was

5138.28 --> 5144.36
there except NE of

5140.88 --> 5144.36
course yeah

5148.639 --> 5155.04
thanks right but I mean now he just

5151.32 --> 5157.48
joins those discords and all that and I

5155.04 --> 5162.84
do that too sometimes I just don't do it

5157.48 --> 5165.32
on my Live recorded show I just go there

5162.84 --> 5167.92
sometimes Earth Awakenings it's actually

5165.32 --> 5171.119
kind of nice they they they do actually

5167.92 --> 5173.4400000000005
moderate against my trolls now which is

5171.119 --> 5173.44
kind of

5173.88 --> 5181.56
pleasant do I think he's genuine Fe are

5178.56 --> 5181.56
you

5182.719 --> 5187.08
what what the [ __ ] does that even

5188.76 --> 5195.639
mean

5190.36 --> 5195.639
grifter oh come on clutch can't be

5207.0 --> 5216.119
serious I don't I don't get it like how

5211.6 --> 5219.360000000001
how how how is that a Griff

5216.119 --> 5219.36
doesn't make any damn

5220.32 --> 5228.239
sense like a grifter doesn't

5223.84 --> 5231.2390000000005
spend all his time on rolling out

5228.239 --> 5233.759999999999
certain message and and understanding

5231.239 --> 5235.239
doesn't you don't do that for like

5233.76 --> 5239.56
almost a

5235.239 --> 5242.839999999999
decade if you're a grifter like no

5239.56 --> 5245.080000000001
grifters create something create a hype

5242.84 --> 5247.679
get all the money and then they leave

5245.08 --> 5250.44
that's what a grifter does how is Nathan

5247.679 --> 5253.159
Oakley doing that I

5250.44 --> 5255.96
mean you don't have to like all his

5253.159 --> 5258.28
methods and his attitude or whatever but

5255.96 --> 5259.96
I mean to call him a grifter is just

5258.28 --> 5262.159
really

5259.96 --> 5265.0
ridiculous doesn't seem to really know

5262.159 --> 5265.0
what a grifter

5267.56 --> 5272.56
is could you define

5270.44 --> 5275.5599999999995
grifter I mean

5272.56 --> 5278.6
seriously if you're going to roll this

5275.56 --> 5282.0
on a side

5278.6 --> 5284.360000000001
hustle I'm sorry but I mean how is he

5282.0 --> 5287.0
actually making a profit out of this as

5284.36 --> 5287.0
a side

5287.8 --> 5293.119000000001
hustle look at the amount of hours

5290.4 --> 5296.44
Nathan actually puts into his

5293.119 --> 5299.4
channel he puts more hours in there than

5296.44 --> 5302.678999999999
I do lots

5299.4 --> 5305.28
more and he's really not making a profit

5302.679 --> 5308.679
I like that's the worst type of g a

5305.28 --> 5313.639
grifter does something for the money for

5308.679 --> 5313.639
the flow he's not getting that for the

5315.04 --> 5323.4
effort it doesn't make any sense one

5318.88 --> 5323.400000000001
hour a day yeah in your dreams

5327.44 --> 5334.44
boy Nathan spends like four to five

5332.119 --> 5337.239
hours on on his computer computer

5334.44 --> 5341.28
building his channel like every day

5337.239 --> 5341.28
that's not an exaggeration like at

5347.119 --> 5353.839999999999
minimum yeah you can think of Nathan

5349.639 --> 5353.84
whatever you like but a grifter

5363.04 --> 5366.04
no

5393.04 --> 5396.04
e

5422.96 --> 5425.96

5560.239 --> 5566.0
who he's a little bit rude as well yeah

5563.719 --> 5568.36
sure Nathan is a little bit rude but it

5566.0 --> 5571.84
has nothing to do with him supposedly

5568.36 --> 5575.28
being a grifter which he is not silly

5571.84 --> 5575.28
thing to say

5579.53 --> 5582.96
[Music]

5590.44 --> 5595.199
okay Nathan is

5592.48 --> 5600.4
reviewing Dave versus wit it now

5595.199 --> 5600.4
surprise surprise very typical

5612.96 --> 5617.639
Flat Earth refuse yeah okay well that's

5615.56 --> 5619.76
just something that he does I don't do

5617.639 --> 5622.08
that but I mean that's because I don't

5619.76 --> 5622.08
do

5632.44 --> 5637.4
that all right the meantime don't forget

5635.119 --> 5642.0
the Rogan up the

5637.4 --> 5642.0
show see I got two that's

5648.94 --> 5652.08
[Music]

5653.159 --> 5660.92
something maybe a new direction oh oh

5656.679 --> 5660.92
maybe oh no

5665.83 --> 5669.01
[Music]

5678.0 --> 5680.76
that hard

5681.639 --> 5686.1990000000005
work okay like it has to be hard

5689.199 --> 5695.44
work I mean doing what I do is not

5692.44 --> 5698.759999999999
necessarily hard work either it might be

5695.44 --> 5698.759999999999
a bit strenuous

5705.44 --> 5711.36
sometimes but I mean what he does it

5708.0 --> 5716.239
does keep people busy I mean people do

5711.36 --> 5716.239
like his reviewing so

5719.239 --> 5724.5599999999995
fine I don't find it particularly

5722.32 --> 5728.639
interesting nor am I interested in

5724.56 --> 5728.639
playing other videos because it's

5730.719 --> 5733.719
just

5734.04 --> 5738.159
yeah I just want to do things

5745.239 --> 5751.599999999999
live I mean technically yesterday

5748.679 --> 5754.08
like that was a live situation with Dell

5751.6 --> 5755.84
getting in the chat doing all that

5754.08 --> 5759.5599999999995
didn't remove him did

5755.84 --> 5762.56
I and I addressed all these points I got

5759.56 --> 5762.56
a little harsh with

5763.239 --> 5768.638999999999
it but I mean that's what I

5770.04 --> 5776.44
do somebody gets in there makes their

5773.04 --> 5779.679
case I give my full

5776.44 --> 5782.839999999999
rebuttal get very analytical like I

5779.679 --> 5785.92
don't have to like put on a Dell stream

5782.84 --> 5788.1990000000005
and then just play it and then just give

5785.92 --> 5791.4800000000005
commentary every

5788.199 --> 5794.799999999999
time when I can just basically summarize

5791.48 --> 5798.04
the entire situation and back engineer

5794.8 --> 5800.679
the the thought the train of thought and

5798.04 --> 5803.56
everything I don't have to review

5800.679 --> 5807.639
something to do

5803.56 --> 5809.56
that don't have to like review play it

5807.639 --> 5815.119
it's just not

5809.56 --> 5815.119000000001
necessary am I still a member there no

5824.639 --> 5830.679
have I been in touch why are you asking

5827.119 --> 5830.679
Steven Jarvis

5863.51 --> 5866.829000000001

5872.44 --> 5876.48

5906.19 --> 5912.849999999999
[Music]

5918.08 --> 5923.84
even though you're a glob you like qi's

5921.32 --> 5925.719
Channel yeah because I don't know Qi is

5923.84 --> 5929.32
kind of funny a lot of people apparently

5925.719 --> 5933.04
are really not entertained by

5929.32 --> 5934.88
that I think you is kind of funny

5933.04 --> 5938.239
[Music]

5934.88 --> 5941.0
just I'm not always in the mood for

5938.239 --> 5943.4
that but sometimes I am and then it's

5941.0 --> 5943.4
really

5949.679 --> 5954.4400000000005
entertaining right but he is in in

5952.159 --> 5957.04
trouble right now so yeah

5954.44 --> 5959.719
sure if you can help him out through

5957.04 --> 5962.719
this gifts and go then by all means do

5959.719 --> 5962.719
that

5967.96 --> 5973.88
although from what I got from Nathan's

5971.0 --> 5976.56
video the kwi isn't technically even

5973.88 --> 5978.96
asking for help it's just something that

5976.56 --> 5978.96
Nathan

5979.36 --> 5984.719
organized

5981.76 --> 5987.96
so need to go

5984.719 --> 5990.199
why why stepen Jaris what what do you

5987.96 --> 5992.719
want from me why do you insist that I

5990.199 --> 5995.598999999999
have to go some other place I'm right

5992.719 --> 5998.08
here right now now is that not good

5995.599 --> 5998.08
enough for

6000.36 --> 6008.5599999999995
you you used to go yeah and now I don't

6004.8 --> 6012.76
it's over you get it it's

6008.56 --> 6012.76
over I'm not going

6013.159 --> 6021.199
back how many times do I need to say

6016.48 --> 6021.199
that before you get it

6037.08 --> 6043.679
yeah you're used to yeah

6039.679 --> 6043.679
well whatever

6057.44 --> 6062.36
right yeah well if Ki comes back then I

6059.639 --> 6065.719
might even get back on with him again or

6062.36 --> 6067.96
something maybe unless Neil gets in the

6065.719 --> 6070.199
way again and starts getting grumpy and

6067.96 --> 6071.96
[ __ ] and then I'll probably just leave

6070.199 --> 6074.199
again because I don't want to deal with

6071.96 --> 6074.199
that

6076.719 --> 6082.36
anymore there constant paranoia towards

6080.159 --> 6084.28
my Direction Just for being there like

6082.36 --> 6086.5599999999995
I'm sick of it

6084.28 --> 6088.639
I'm sick of the attitudes I just want to

6086.56 --> 6092.04
be somewhere and just be able to be

6088.639 --> 6096.36
myself I have no hostile intentions

6092.04 --> 6098.84
whatsoever their paranoia is completely

6096.36 --> 6101.08
unfounded and nobody's doing anything

6098.84 --> 6101.08
about

6104.08 --> 6108.36
it I'm done

6120.45 --> 6123.54
[Music]

6124.56 --> 6129.2390000000005
right and hey if any of those guys want

6126.48 --> 6132.959999999999
to hang out with me and maybe like have

6129.239 --> 6136.36
a chat here they can contact me on Skype

6132.96 --> 6139.0
if they want and do that they're not

6136.36 --> 6139.0
doing that

6141.44 --> 6147.0
though I've unbanned you on Q's Channel

6144.48 --> 6151.5599999999995
few months ago yeah when I still had the

6147.0 --> 6151.56
wrench and then I didn't have a wrench

6153.04 --> 6157.239
anymore they took my wrench and they

6155.32 --> 6160.679
took my wrench at Nathan's and then it's

6157.239 --> 6160.678999999999
like yeah now then I

6164.88 --> 6171.639
leave yeah if they think it's more

6167.48 --> 6173.5199999999995
important that a notorious nasty troll

6171.639 --> 6175.400000000001
just gets a wrench because oh had a

6173.52 --> 6177.8
wrench for so long yeah and he's acting

6175.4 --> 6180.239
like a complete [ __ ] Maniac but

6177.8 --> 6184.2390000000005
that's apparently perfectly

6180.239 --> 6187.159
fine it's perfectly fine to have that in

6184.239 --> 6190.718999999999
provably sick insane person who is a

6187.159 --> 6193.799999999999
nasty troll just have that wrench

6190.719 --> 6195.84
because they had it for so long rather

6193.8 --> 6200.0
than I don't

6195.84 --> 6202.4800000000005
know accommodating for the most veteran

6200.0 --> 6203.84
member of the entire show besides the

6202.48 --> 6207.04
show host

6203.84 --> 6209.92
himself right yeah well what the hell do

6207.04 --> 6209.92
you want from me

6223.92 --> 6230.4
then yeah I

6227.159 --> 6234.5199999999995
left I'm not going to be demoted like

6230.4 --> 6234.5199999999995
that it's humiliating

6236.76 --> 6239.84
is that teret

6262.04 --> 6265.04
yeah

6279.8 --> 6282.869000000001
[Music]

6292.04 --> 6296.0
for for

6338.0 --> 6340.8
so you get it

6349.56 --> 6353.8
now hey kumus

6372.36 --> 6376.199
34

6373.96 --> 6378.639
watching that's

6376.199 --> 6380.678999999999
schol hope everybody's entertained I

6378.639 --> 6384.88
mean it's not like

6380.679 --> 6386.92
I'm just rolling it out out having a lot

6384.88 --> 6389.0
to say but I mean I guess it's just one

6386.92 --> 6391.28
of those days where just people talk

6389.0 --> 6394.56
about random stuff and I'll

6391.28 --> 6397.92
just hang there for a

6394.56 --> 6397.92
bit it's

6399.44 --> 6405.199
freaking work that somebody's doing on

6402.76 --> 6407.639
their house I mean it's very distracting

6405.199 --> 6407.638999999999
too

6408.96 --> 6414.84
so if they'd stop I'd probably be able

6411.88 --> 6414.84
to concentrate my

6418.239 --> 6422.48
better but doesn't seem like they're

6420.36 --> 6422.48
going

6423.96 --> 6429.2390000000005
to hey KP good to see you

6443.88 --> 6447.76
all right I was thinking by the way of

6448.199 --> 6452.199
a interesting

6454.36 --> 6461.598999999999
Mantra is it in your own part

6457.88 --> 6465.159000000001
no it's sort of across but it's like

6461.599 --> 6468.4400000000005
right doors are open right it goes right

6465.159 --> 6470.239
to this wall basically it's not inside

6468.44 --> 6474.839999999999
of the

6470.239 --> 6474.839999999999
apartment that would probably be less

6476.96 --> 6483.36
distracting uh but I was thinking

6481.199 --> 6486.919999999999
like just

6483.36 --> 6486.92
the like a

6487.52 --> 6492.56
saying don't be triggered be

6493.8 --> 6500.679
activated cuz I think I sometimes with

6497.239 --> 6503.678999999999
the way that I am I'm like excessively

6500.679 --> 6503.679
expressive

6504.159 --> 6509.5599999999995
I intend to do that to be activating not

6507.28 --> 6512.28
to be

6509.56 --> 6515.1990000000005
triggering but unfortunately some people

6512.28 --> 6516.8
then just like they they don't

6515.199 --> 6519.5599999999995
understand that nature or they're just

6516.8 --> 6521.1990000000005
not very receptive for it in a moment

6519.56 --> 6523.320000000001
and then they do get

6521.199 --> 6525.96
triggered even though that's never

6523.32 --> 6525.96
really my

6526.8 --> 6531.320000000001
intention

6528.4 --> 6533.32
like if I want to trigger somebody like

6531.32 --> 6536.84
that's usually when I'm just is really

6533.32 --> 6538.5599999999995
pissed off then I might be like saying

6536.84 --> 6541.4800000000005
things specifically to just try to

6538.56 --> 6543.360000000001
trigger people but I mean I don't do

6541.48 --> 6546.5599999999995
that as much anymore at

6543.36 --> 6550.04
least I try to avoid that it's not a

6546.56 --> 6554.1990000000005
good thing when I do that but overall I

6550.04 --> 6554.199
try to be activating and not

6559.719 --> 6565.719
triggering so maybe I'll put that in the

6562.159 --> 6565.719
title better of freaking

6566.81 --> 6569.859
[Music]

6573.159 --> 6576.159
wrestling

6580.04 --> 6584.44
right like ball winded

6588.44 --> 6594.638999999999
what what what does he have to do with

6592.0 --> 6594.639
anything

6611.76 --> 6618.04
triggering right yeah well Ballwin isn't

6615.84 --> 6621.04
meant to be triggering he's meant to be

6618.04 --> 6621.04
activating

6622.8 --> 6628.0
right it was born as an opposition not

6624.679 --> 6630.52
to trigger people but to actually give

6628.0 --> 6630.52
proper

6638.44 --> 6645.638999999999
opposition and sometimes to enact the

6641.76 --> 6645.639
opponent you have to be

6645.679 --> 6649.36
psychologically triggering with your

6647.639 --> 6654.0
timing and all that because that's part

6649.36 --> 6656.96
of it I mean what Ballers do

6654.0 --> 6661.639
is subconsciously try to

6656.96 --> 6664.32
disrupt the cohesive thought and flow of

6661.639 --> 6664.32
Flat Earth

6665.239 --> 6672.28
reasoning so yeah if you want to do that

6669.719 --> 6674.44
if you want to emulate that like bwin

6672.28 --> 6678.119
you have you're going to be triggering

6674.44 --> 6682.678999999999
to Flat earthers because disrupting them

6678.119 --> 6682.679
is part of the standard procedures

6689.199 --> 6696.5599999999995
I and I never like really even overdid

6692.8 --> 6696.56
it or anything was very

6702.84 --> 6709.079
modest we Tred to inject logic of is L

6706.599 --> 6711.119000000001
indeed AUM yeah I know that's what

6709.079 --> 6714.119
you're

6711.119 --> 6717.079
trying I know that's your intention it's

6714.119 --> 6721.36
just you don't really have full

6717.079 --> 6721.36
control when that happens now do

6734.96 --> 6740.52
you full control yeah keep telling

6737.679 --> 6744.04
yourself that auma virus keep telling

6740.52 --> 6744.040000000001
yourself that

6762.28 --> 6767.599
right because when the cohesion falters

6765.079 --> 6771.119
you can always just make a joke out of

6767.599 --> 6774.4400000000005
it and say lol after everything and then

6771.119 --> 6774.44
you're safe

6777.199 --> 6780.638999999999
right because whatever somebody's going

6778.639 --> 6783.2390000000005
to point out you can always take it in

6780.639 --> 6786.04
two different

6783.239 --> 6790.4
directions it's laying the safe ground

6786.04 --> 6793.239
for doing whatever you do

6790.4 --> 6794.96
right when somebody tries to Define your

6793.239 --> 6796.5599999999995
motives you can always point in the

6794.96 --> 6800.44
other direction the other way of

6796.56 --> 6803.280000000001
interpreting it is what you

6800.44 --> 6805.598999999999
do you make a joke with yeah I know

6803.28 --> 6809.8
you're a real Joker you're a real clown

6805.599 --> 6809.8
akumu virus we know

6840.4 --> 6843.4
for

6913.719 --> 6917.199
what was that

6932.079 --> 6936.84
suddenly remember something that I was

6933.84 --> 6936.84
thinking about last

6938.44 --> 6944.839999999999
night yeah can't really focus on that

6942.48 --> 6949.44
get to it I mean I have sometimes like

6944.84 --> 6952.76
seeds of ideas and then they just have

6949.44 --> 6955.119
to mature and that takes something time

6952.76 --> 6957.8
sometimes it takes like a

6955.119 --> 6960.4
week and then I just figure out like

6957.8 --> 6962.76
okay the idea is matured is this like a

6960.4 --> 6965.839999999999
proper concept that I can put down or is

6962.76 --> 6965.84
it just going to fizzle

6969.92 --> 6975.4
immediately I was thinking of like the

6973.599 --> 6978.119000000001
issue

6975.4 --> 6982.759999999999
with relative

6978.119 --> 6985.4
density and the direction the the axial

6982.76 --> 6987.679
situation and how that appears to change

6985.4 --> 6991.5199999999995
for moving

6987.679 --> 6995.1990000000005
objects and then realize like the issue

6991.52 --> 6995.1990000000005
is very much like

6998.4 --> 7005.598999999999
coris right if you move with the moving

7002.96 --> 7009.2390000000005
object in free full then it seems like

7005.599 --> 7011.92
the entire world could be seen as moving

7009.239 --> 7013.799999999999
upwards but I mean that's literally like

7011.92 --> 7018.36
a

7013.8 --> 7019.76
coris type illusion right just like oh

7018.36 --> 7023.598999999999
the

7019.76 --> 7026.719
entire the the thing is moving at a

7023.599 --> 7028.639
strange Factor well it's not it's just

7026.719 --> 7030.52
that you're the one that's moving

7028.639 --> 7033.639
spitting on a

7030.52 --> 7036.639
roundabout and

7033.639 --> 7038.599
so Dell is kind of stuck with his

7036.639 --> 7044.159000000001
presuppositional conception of Earth

7038.599 --> 7044.159000000001
moving upward and it's very similar

7045.76 --> 7050.56
to the concept of coris

7054.159 --> 7060.879999999999
effect cuz he's basically saying like

7057.639 --> 7063.639
yeah when you're on a roundabout and you

7060.88 --> 7065.639
throw the ball what it's supposed to go

7063.639 --> 7067.400000000001
in a in a straight line right it's the

7065.639 --> 7068.679
laws of physic the laws of physics have

7067.4 --> 7070.04
been the bunk because you're on the

7068.679 --> 7072.92
roundabout you throw the ball and

7070.04 --> 7075.8
suddenly it goes in an arc that means

7072.92 --> 7080.1990000000005
the laws of physics are debunk okay

7075.8 --> 7083.04
that's kind of parallel to the case that

7080.199 --> 7084.96
he's trying to make it's a coris

7083.04 --> 7086.679
confusion he thinks that because an

7084.96 --> 7089.04
object is moving that whatever is

7086.679 --> 7091.4
happening within the object that that

7089.04 --> 7094.719
negates relative

7091.4 --> 7094.719
density but it

7095.48 --> 7106.959999999999
isn't it's like a coris

7099.92 --> 7106.96
confusion so the analogy is like that is

7107.92 --> 7115.2390000000005
something like I I figured out the

7112.079 --> 7118.96
nature of the mistake he's making and it

7115.239 --> 7118.959999999999
is very much like Corola

7123.32 --> 7129.119
confusion it's just wind okay Steven

7126.44 --> 7134.04
Jarvis

7129.119 --> 7134.04
what what the [ __ ] does that even mean

7136.56 --> 7141.119000000001
all right anyway I'm going to take two

7137.92 --> 7141.119
minute break I'll be right

7161.04 --> 7164.04
back

7191.04 --> 7194.04
e

7220.96 --> 7223.96
for

7250.92 --> 7254.96
for for

7296.97 --> 7302.459
[Music]

7306.04 --> 7309.599
and I'm back

7317.56 --> 7324.119000000001
s Warrior I don't no auma virus I think

7322.119 --> 7325.88
you're talking [ __ ]

7324.119 --> 7328.679
now

7325.88 --> 7332.4400000000005
yeah sounds like

7328.679 --> 7334.8
nonsense or maybe a misspeak on his part

7332.44 --> 7334.799999999999
it's

7335.239 --> 7343.04
silly uh so yeah let's not talk

7339.88 --> 7344.76
about what's supposed other Flat Earth

7343.04 --> 7349.84
has said because I don't really trust

7344.76 --> 7349.84
you on that all right

7385.44 --> 7390.48
back oh he said it somewhere in the past

7393.199 --> 7402.4
okay yeah well like in 2017 and before a

7398.52 --> 7404.119000000001
lot of us were just kind of guessing

7402.4 --> 7408.159
I still like how these things were we

7404.119 --> 7410.96
weren't all all read up and studied into

7408.159 --> 7415.719
all of it as

7410.96 --> 7417.56
much but uh after that point yeah I mean

7415.719 --> 7420.159
pretty

7417.56 --> 7423.320000000001
much like we just corrected everybody

7420.159 --> 7426.96
when they got it wrong after that

7423.32 --> 7430.04
point like in recent times there's not

7426.96 --> 7433.599
going to be any kind of clip like that

7430.04 --> 7433.599
definitely not

7435.92 --> 7442.52
right but I mean a lot of people made a

7437.88 --> 7442.52
lot of mistakes a lot of flatters back

7444.119 --> 7450.239
then even if you look at like the older

7446.76 --> 7452.599
shows like from Patricia and all that

7450.239 --> 7455.28
like flat earthers were still just so

7452.599 --> 7458.96
shocked over all the

7455.28 --> 7461.92
trolling now no flat earther still talks

7458.96 --> 7464.36
about that because we're all used used

7461.92 --> 7467.2390000000005
to it like yeah that's what

7464.36 --> 7470.558999999999
happens back then it was like w look at

7467.239 --> 7474.718999999999
this radical change and now we're like

7470.559 --> 7474.719
yeah these freaks don't really go

7475.36 --> 7479.5199999999995
away and so you sto talking

7489.599 --> 7495.599
about still clips being made today yeah

7493.04 --> 7500.719
whatever

7495.599 --> 7500.719
man whatever you need to live with

7520.639 --> 7524.679
yourself e

7557.4 --> 7561.32
you can live Justin cat videos yeah

7559.48 --> 7565.4
accept you

7561.32 --> 7565.4
don't you're just saying

7580.559 --> 7584.559
that e

7620.0 --> 7624.36
right so been going over two

7631.0 --> 7635.96
hours they're still

7633.32 --> 7638.36
going I really hope that's going to be

7635.96 --> 7640.92
done soon I don't want to like have like

7638.36 --> 7643.28
oh nice summer week but it's somebody

7640.92 --> 7646.8
freaking Drilling in the wall every

7643.28 --> 7646.8
single day and that's going to

7648.8 --> 7653.119000000001
suck really hope they're going to be

7650.8 --> 7653.119000000001
down

7655.36 --> 7661.5199999999995
soon but I feared like this is might

7657.92 --> 7664.36
take like the entire week or

7661.52 --> 7667.4400000000005
something if so then I'm probably just

7664.36 --> 7671.92
not going to be in top for the coming

7667.44 --> 7674.919999999999
week I'm going to do my best anyway

7671.92 --> 7674.92
all

my mic is off no it

7782.639 --> 7788.76
isn't I'll turn my mic off yeah that's

7785.44 --> 7791.759999999999
too bad Rogan's it up okay thank you for

7788.76 --> 7791.76
that

7793.4 --> 7798.759999999999
33 watching oh Illuminati confirmed or

7797.0 --> 7801.44
something even though it's like in my

7798.76 --> 7801.4400000000005
email and

7804.159 --> 7811.159
everything they say the Moon is moving

7807.0 --> 7813.239
further away than first thought oh

7811.159 --> 7815.96
sure sure it

7813.239 --> 7818.28
is but you wouldn't be able to tell by

7815.96 --> 7821.159
the angular size of

7818.28 --> 7823.32
it this is definitely not doing that at

7821.159 --> 7823.32
all

7827.36 --> 7831.598999999999
oh makes sense

7850.239 --> 7854.28
right for

7887.239 --> 7890.199
after to the

7890.96 --> 7896.559
sun yeah you keep

7893.44 --> 7898.919999999999
fantasizing just keep imagining how it's

7896.559 --> 7902.559
really there and it has these distances

7898.92 --> 7905.559
and it's this ball of dirt and a ball of

7902.559 --> 7907.04
burning gas or plasma or whatever the

7905.559 --> 7909.559
[ __ ] it's supposed to be because you're

7907.04 --> 7912.36
not really entirely sure anymore because

7909.559 --> 7914.639
the consensus is kind of divided and the

7912.36 --> 7916.759999999999
oldfashioned way of viewing it seems to

7914.639 --> 7921.04
be faltering over time and all of that

7916.76 --> 7925.04
is just perfectly normal for a

7921.04 --> 7927.559
Ballard right because the foundation of

7925.04 --> 7930.44
what you think it is could just go shift

7927.559 --> 7932.159000000001
around and if the science suddenly says

7930.44 --> 7934.678999999999
it's different well then it's suddenly

7932.159 --> 7938.04
different and it was always like that

7934.679 --> 7941.719
it's not 9080 for a mind control

7938.04 --> 7941.719

7963.639 --> 7968.28
Here Comes little old me saying it's a

7968.88 --> 7975.679
hologram angular non local manifestation

7972.88 --> 7978.32
I mean there's no evidence of any

7975.679 --> 7980.8
location of them only angular location

7978.32 --> 7983.199
and angular location change over time

7980.8 --> 7986.96
and that's

7983.199 --> 7990.0
it no size increase no proof of

7986.96 --> 7992.639
proximity lots of claims of supposed

7990.0 --> 7995.76
signal rebounds even

7992.639 --> 7997.559
though there's no real evidence for that

7995.76 --> 8000.079000000001
there no varying and

7997.559 --> 8002.04
manipulating the signal towards the

8000.079 --> 8005.4
Target and away from from the target

8002.04 --> 8006.639
with live readout proof none of that I

8005.4 --> 8008.96
had a whole discussion on Earth

8006.639 --> 8009.92
Awakenings Discord yesterday about that

8008.96 --> 8013.8
with the

8009.92 --> 8015.84
Ballers like over half an hour they all

8013.8 --> 8018.96
said it they all like oh we got the

8015.84 --> 8021.88
videos oh we like yeah and then I

8018.96 --> 8024.92
proceed to just

8021.88 --> 8026.76
describe what I've actually seen video

8024.92 --> 8028.84
wise of what they would do and there

8026.76 --> 8031.360000000001
wouldn't even be a moon in the video

8028.84 --> 8034.28
visible it's just a read out of on the

8031.36 --> 8036.079
screen and nothing is very manipulated

8034.28 --> 8039.5199999999995
and that's supposedly the evidence of a

8036.079 --> 8043.719
signal bounce to the moon and there are

8039.52 --> 8047.320000000001
no better videos of this there's I mean

8043.719 --> 8049.52
I laid out the setup that would be

8047.32 --> 8053.36
required for me to convince that any

8049.52 --> 8058.0
signal is actually possible to rebound

8053.36 --> 8060.92
on the Moon I mean detailed dedicated

8058.0 --> 8063.8
Early Bird videos where I would explain

8060.92 --> 8066.679
this for like an hour straight exactly

8063.8 --> 8069.28
what would be required in order

8066.679 --> 8072.599
to deliver

8069.28 --> 8074.96
some feasible evidence in that direction

8072.599 --> 8078.4400000000005
and it's never been done even though it

8074.96 --> 8080.0
should be very easy to do that and not

8078.44 --> 8082.799999999999
that expensive at

8080.0 --> 8084.599
all and people still claim that it's

8082.8 --> 8086.52
just it's just done people have done

8084.599 --> 8089.079
that it's on the internet oh everybody's

8086.52 --> 8092.4800000000005
doing it all the time but you can't show

8089.079 --> 8095.28
it properly though

8092.48 --> 8097.079
yeah no pointing it at the Moon pointing

8095.28 --> 8098.639
it away from the Moon oh no more signal

8097.079 --> 8100.04
rebounds oh pointing it at the Moon

8098.639 --> 8104.159000000001
again oh there it is again no pointing

8100.04 --> 8108.719
it away oh that's gone again no none of

8104.159 --> 8108.719
that none of that

8123.079 --> 8128.96
shooting into space and one at

8130.36 --> 8136.839999999999
what yeah sure and I'm sure they varied

8133.719 --> 8141.0

absolute nonsense back and

8242.12 --> 8247.479000000001
forth and just getting more diluted and

8245.16 --> 8247.479
more

8248.479 --> 8252.84
ridiculous and not responding to

8250.96 --> 8255.279999999999
whatever I'm pointing out I'm kind of

8252.84 --> 8255.28
sick of

8259.28 --> 8264.960000000001
it yeah we're having fun yeah with your

8261.96 --> 8264.96
nonsense

8276.04 --> 8280.319000000001
that you respond oh really you call that

8278.04 --> 8280.319000000001
a

8292.92 --> 8298.2
response don't know what to add well

8295.84 --> 8301.679
clutch did you ever see a

8298.2 --> 8304.599
video whenever Moon signal rebound

8301.679 --> 8306.359
supposedly was brought up a video that

8304.599 --> 8309.2
actually

8306.359 --> 8312.0
showed a device that would send a signal

8309.2 --> 8314.08
to the moon and then that device being

8312.0 --> 8316.479
pointed away from the Moon and then the

8314.08 --> 8319.84
signal rebound read out on a screen

8316.479 --> 8323.199999999999
would immediately respond to

8319.84 --> 8325.479
not not receiving a signal anymore have

8323.2 --> 8329.92
you ever seen a video like

8325.479 --> 8329.92
that cuz I haven't

8331.519 --> 8337.639000000001
but I mean oh they're talking about oh

8333.679 --> 8340.960000000001
did you allow Corola win yeah let's add

8337.639 --> 8340.96
for the ridiculous

8342.2 --> 8348.240000000002
nonsense like let's account for the cor

8345.28 --> 8350.960000000001
like the the continual

8348.24 --> 8353.399
wins that would happen on a spinning

8350.96 --> 8355.759999999998
ball Earth that don't actually happen in

8353.399 --> 8359.479
physical reality did you account for

8355.76 --> 8363.599
that with your supposed signal rebound

8359.479 --> 8363.599
thing that's not d demonstrated on

8364.12 --> 8371.679

8368.679 --> 8371.679

8429.84 --> 8437.64
nice thanks for sharing

8432.84 --> 8437.64
that glutch that's hilarious

8464.16 --> 8471.68
Professor who's the did flat Zoid rename

8468.359 --> 8471.68
himself Professor

8472.04 --> 8475.04
Zoid

8479.56 --> 8483.56
wow for

8495.02 --> 8498.099
[Music]

8515.2 --> 8522.6
oh oh yeah you think that flat Zoid

8519.64 --> 8526.68
thinks gorola should make things fly

8522.6 --> 8529.0
away at 1,000 milph on the equator yeah

8526.68 --> 8532.359
if they're separated from the

8529.0 --> 8534.76
earth then they eventually end up in the

8532.359 --> 8537.399000000001
separated reference frame if you're if

8534.76 --> 8539.52
the Earth is a spinning ball and they

8537.399 --> 8542.279999999999
end up in the separated reference frame

8539.52 --> 8545.16
of the air if they can float in there

8542.28 --> 8548.24
and then they are going to move at vast

8545.16 --> 8551.0
speeds at the

8548.24 --> 8553.76
equator because the Earth is spinning

8551.0 --> 8557.319
underneath that air that is standing

8553.76 --> 8560.479
still because it's not susceptible to

8557.319 --> 8562.199999999999
momentum yeah that's I mean it's kind of

8560.479 --> 8564.399
silly to think that that would actually

8562.2 --> 8566.800000000001
happen because that would thinking that

8564.399 --> 8569.599999999999
that would happen assumes that you're

8566.8 --> 8571.599999999999
actually on a spinning ball Earth I

8569.6 --> 8573.439
don't assume I'm on a spinning bow earth

8571.6 --> 8577.6
like that's your claim that's the

8573.439 --> 8580.439
baller's claim that's what you should be

8577.6 --> 8583.08
saying that should be happening because

8580.439 --> 8585.720000000001
you believe the Earth is a spinning

8583.08 --> 8588.6
ball it's not the flat earthers claim I

8585.72 --> 8590.72
mean we just think it's

8588.6 --> 8593.28
stationary there's nothing spinning

8590.72 --> 8593.279999999999
there's nothing

8593.6 --> 8599.92
moving not the earth the earth is not

8596.56 --> 8603.76
moving so there is no coris deviation

8599.92 --> 8607.72
that we should be anticipating as

8603.76 --> 8610.04
flats and hey guess what there isn't any

8607.72 --> 8613.199999999999
there's no Coralis deviation on this

8610.04 --> 8613.2
Earth because the Earth is

8614.319 --> 8621.039999999999
stationary it's misunderstood oh coris

8617.68 --> 8626.439
deviation coris effect is something else

8621.04 --> 8631.12
yes AUM virus sure it's something else

8626.439 --> 8634.24
now it's not an apparent deviation

8631.12 --> 8637.439
because of reference frames no it's

8634.24 --> 8638.96
something actually moving now and that

8637.439 --> 8642.279
proves because there's something

8638.96 --> 8644.519999999999
actually moving there's wind and it goes

8642.279 --> 8647.16
in a circle if it's fast enough yeah

8644.52 --> 8651.640000000001
tornadoes and hurricanes and that is the

8647.16 --> 8654.76
corol deviation not the apparent

8651.64 --> 8657.439
illusion of a deviation because you're

8654.76 --> 8660.6
mistaken yourself to be stationary while

8657.439 --> 8663.68
you're on a spinning reference frame

8660.6 --> 8665.6
which is actually the core definition of

8663.68 --> 8668.16
Corola effect it's not that now

8665.6 --> 8671.6
something really is moving and that

8668.16 --> 8674.279
means that it's on a spinning thing yeah

8671.6 --> 8677.439
that's globis that's complete nonsense

8674.279 --> 8677.439
that's not

8677.72 --> 8684.358999999999
evident it's a conception that's being

8681.88 --> 8688.24
added to

8684.359 --> 8691.24
Wikipedia contradicting the

8688.24 --> 8695.76
official definition of chore effect but

8691.24 --> 8695.76
you can keep believing that if you like

8731.439 --> 8735.84
yes now everybody doesn't understand it

8733.84 --> 8737.84
right akumu virus that way you're always

8735.84 --> 8741.04
good because nobody understands it

8737.84 --> 8744.279
except we do understand it you're the

8741.04 --> 8747.720000000001
one that just thinks we don't because

8744.279 --> 8752.08
your definition of coris effect is just

8747.72 --> 8752.08
delusional and undefinable

8758.479 --> 8764.039999999999
yeah there is no cor yeah because the

8761.96 --> 8767.199999999999
Earth's not

8764.04 --> 8769.04
spinning yeah that's why cuz the Earth

8767.2 --> 8771.76
is stationary you're right there is no

8769.04 --> 8772.800000000001
coris deviation at the equator cuz the

8771.76 --> 8776.76
Earth is

8772.8 --> 8781.759999999998
stationary that's a globe claim no

8776.76 --> 8784.2
that's a balard in denial claim

8781.76 --> 8787.84
yeah we know the Earth is spinning

8784.2 --> 8790.720000000001
because there is no coris deviation yeah

8787.84 --> 8793.319
yeah yeah we know the Earth is a globe

8790.72 --> 8796.438999999998
because it looks so

8793.319 --> 8798.8
flat we know the Earth is an open system

8796.439 --> 8801.0
to the Outer Space Universe because we

8798.8 --> 8803.72
have gas pressure that we can

8801.0 --> 8806.359
breathe right without containment yeah

8803.72 --> 8810.64
yeah that's literally called a globe

8806.359 --> 8814.960000000001
[ __ ] in denial position

8810.64 --> 8817.599999999999
anti flat earther that's you Kuma

8814.96 --> 8819.919999999998
virus you're the anti-flat earther that

8817.6 --> 8819.92
does

8823.279 --> 8828.439
that it's so biggie it's flatty yeah

8830.439 --> 8836.720000000001
yeah except it isn't that

8833.439 --> 8838.279
big parameters the geometry is very

8836.72 --> 8841.278999999999
specifically defined Within

8855.96 --> 8861.199999999999
hey don't bring in 90 into this KP

8874.479 --> 8878.0
just don't bring up that the Horizon is

8876.72 --> 8882.08
at

8878.0 --> 8882.08
a 90d dee

8886.24 --> 8893.359
angle right to the

8890.359 --> 8893.359
perpendicular

8894.319 --> 8900.399
sorry what's wrong with

8897.52 --> 8902.68
90 it's flat

8900.399 --> 8909.479
90

8902.68 --> 8913.720000000001
flat not curvy flat 90 flat not curvy

8909.479 --> 8913.72
that's not 90 no flat is

8916.0 --> 8924.08
90 it's just 90 yeah 90° to the Horizon

8921.64 --> 8926.56
cuz it's

8924.08 --> 8930.359
flat it's a sphere it's not going to be

8926.56 --> 8933.278999999999
90° to Horizon it's going to be 90° to a

8930.359 --> 8935.84
arbitrary line in the middle of the sky

8933.279 --> 8935.84
above the

8936.359 --> 8942.439
Horizon that's what the 90 would help

8939.64 --> 8944.8
you establish if you're on a sphere but

8942.439 --> 8948.479000000001
you're not on a sphere you're on a flat

8944.8 --> 8950.679999999998
Earth and so the 90° helps you establish

8948.479 --> 8954.119999999999
the

8950.68 --> 8958.56
Horizon in relation to a vertical and

8954.12 --> 8958.560000000001
that works out because the Earth is flat

8967.76 --> 8972.92
it's just an

8970.08 --> 8977.24
angle it's just an angle it's just just

8972.92 --> 8979.24
90° it's just flat just measured flat

8977.24 --> 8981.92
that's

8979.24 --> 8984.16
all I mean just because it's measured

8981.92 --> 8986.88
flat doesn't mean it can't be a

8984.16 --> 8989.319
sphere right you just have to bend

8986.88 --> 8992.56
everything in your mind and nothing is

8989.319 --> 8995.64
where you actually see it to be because

8992.56 --> 8998.84
it looks so flat you know it's

8995.64 --> 9001.8
spherical because you measure it flat

8998.84 --> 9004.49
that means that it's a

9001.8 --> 9007.958999999999
sphere right a

9004.49 --> 9007.958999999999

yeah you chant for me just just deny it

9020.2 --> 9026.2
yeah virtue signal to your Bal

9022.399 --> 9029.56

9026.2 --> 9029.560000000001
are evident

9062.68 --> 9070.84
can you have curved lines that are

9065.6 --> 9070.84
paralyzed no it's a Jaris

9084.92 --> 9090.76
besides you don't use curved lines in

9087.2 --> 9090.76
establishing angles

9091.279 --> 9099.359
ever like a triangle uses straight

9096.12 --> 9101.0
lines it doesn't you any use any curved

9099.359 --> 9104.800000000001
lines you

9101.0 --> 9108.96
see it's not how geometry is

9104.8 --> 9110.8
done it's not how you use geometry in

9108.96 --> 9114.438999999998
basic angles

9110.8 --> 9119.119999999999
in Celestial navigation you use

9114.439 --> 9122.2
them in relation to straight

9119.12 --> 9124.12
lines and angles to the Horizon into a

9122.2 --> 9127.640000000001
Celestial

9124.12 --> 9130.800000000001
body all you straight lines all of it

9127.64 --> 9135.599999999999
there's no curved lines that are getting

9130.8 --> 9135.599999999999
involved in Celestial navigation

[Music]

9156.279 --> 9161.880000000001
all right clutch thanks for being there

9157.96 --> 9164.24
see you see you next time have a great

9161.88 --> 9167.24
day

9164.24 --> 9167.24
parallelogram

9168.84 --> 9172.8
what for

9206.16 --> 9214.359
oh the R value oh the R

9210.12 --> 9217.52
value that they can't technically

9214.359 --> 9220.880000000001
establish because whenever they try to

9217.52 --> 9224.0
they realize the Horizon is not in the

9220.88 --> 9228.24
proper position geometrically in order

9224.0 --> 9230.68
for them to establish the R

9228.24 --> 9232.68
value cuz you have have to measure it

9230.68 --> 9234.359
you can't just presuppose it but yeah it

9232.68 --> 9238.56
doesn't really work out because The

9234.359 --> 9243.319
Horizon's just not really helping you

9238.56 --> 9246.119999999999
out with trying to measure the

9243.319 --> 9248.439
radius so then you have to just

9246.12 --> 9251.6
presuppose that light is bending it's

9248.439 --> 9256.24
called terrestrial refraction and then

9251.6 --> 9258.880000000001
by presupposing that you suddenly lose

9256.24 --> 9261.96
permanently the ability to actually

9258.88 --> 9263.839999999998
measure the radius is you can only

9261.96 --> 9267.759999999998
presuppose it

9263.84 --> 9271.12
now and then explain through terrestrial

9267.76 --> 9273.479
refraction why the Horizon isn't in its

9271.12 --> 9276.12
proper geometric position that it should

9273.479 --> 9278.76
be in accordance to the globe

9276.12 --> 9281.359
geometry

9278.76 --> 9282.880000000001
right you can only presuppose it from

9281.359 --> 9285.399000000001
that point on because you can't measure

9282.88 --> 9288.039999999999
it anymore because it won't be in the

9285.399 --> 9290.24
geometric position where it's supposed

9288.04 --> 9292.439
to be in order for you to established

9290.24 --> 9296.76
the geometry through

9292.439 --> 9296.76
measurement it's called the arnian

9304.359 --> 9310.68
Paradox get it from 60 nautical miles

9307.96 --> 9314.56
per degree yeah you presuppose that

9310.68 --> 9317.76
there is a degree per 60 nautical miles

9314.56 --> 9320.08
cuz you don't actually measure that you

9317.76 --> 9323.279
don't measure the geometry you just

9320.08 --> 9327.0
assume that there is a

9323.279 --> 9330.279
geometry and then you with the

9327.0 --> 9333.479
Assumption establish how much geometry

9330.279 --> 9335.2
should be there over a distance not

9333.479 --> 9338.679999999998
through measurement but through

9335.2 --> 9338.68
calculation using

9339.6 --> 9346.84
presupposition that's what you do Akuma

9341.8 --> 9346.84
virus we know all about that here

9360.04 --> 9365.479000000001
at distances of

9362.6 --> 9368.479000000001
cities and at them

9365.479 --> 9368.479
together

9369.479 --> 9376.119999999999
what so you add all these City locations

9373.8 --> 9378.599999999999
that are all parallel in relation to one

9376.12 --> 9382.08
another but the angle towards the sun

9378.6 --> 9382.08
solar position might be

9382.96 --> 9386.919999999998
different and if you just add all those

9385.6 --> 9390.319
parallel

9386.92 --> 9392.64
locations that adds together the

9390.319 --> 9395.319
circumference does it or does it just

9392.64 --> 9398.599999999999
add up to a straight line pretty sure it

9395.319 --> 9398.6
just adds up to a straight

9403.84 --> 9410.08
line will give you a circumference but

9406.64 --> 9414.68
of a circle or a straight line

9410.08 --> 9414.68
that Loops in on itself not entirely

9415.479 --> 9419.399
sure a distance for

9419.76 --> 9423.6

really is the supposed Circle that

9508.08 --> 9517.84
people say it is that are flat

earthers I know it does pan out in more

9518.08 --> 9524.2
easily when you try to put everything

9520.84 --> 9525.76
together in the map but I mean does that

9524.2 --> 9528.08
actually mean because it's more

9525.76 --> 9530.279
convenient when you try to puzzle things

9528.08 --> 9533.2
together to think of the earth as a

9530.279 --> 9535.92
disc do you then just stick to that or

9533.2 --> 9538.720000000001
are you going to be honest and realize

9535.92 --> 9541.56
like well you'd have to measure the

9538.72 --> 9543.92
orientation of the Equator to

9541.56 --> 9547.56
establish geometrically whether the

9543.92 --> 9550.72
equator is actually that

9547.56 --> 9554.24
Circle or is it a straight line like a

9550.72 --> 9558.08
dead reckoning straight line not a

9554.24 --> 9560.0
straight line around a a curved

9558.08 --> 9563.279
Horizon but

9560.0 --> 9565.68
straight line and it Loops in on

9563.279 --> 9568.68
itself you move in a straight line you

9565.68 --> 9574.960000000001
end up at the place you started without

9568.68 --> 9574.960000000001

looping train man station in The

9580.6 --> 9585.439
Matrix the second part

9590.279 --> 9594.0

9592.72 --> 9595.679999999998
that it is

9594.0 --> 9598.96
circum

9595.68 --> 9602.52
yeah you can just assume that it's a

9598.96 --> 9602.519999999999
circle sure you

9603.279 --> 9611.0
can a loop is a circle no a loop is a

9607.399 --> 9614.0
loop it's a indicator for spatial

9611.0 --> 9617.0
interconnectivity a circle is a

9614.0 --> 9617.0
geometric

9617.76 --> 9625.399
shape like a circle is a specific

9621.0 --> 9625.399
geometry with angles and everything

9627.08 --> 9633.279
involved Loop is a special

9631.08 --> 9635.16
interconnection the straight line is not

9633.279 --> 9638.52
a

9635.16 --> 9642.84
circle if the straight

9638.52 --> 9644.800000000001
line connects in on itself that doesn't

9642.84 --> 9647.56
make it a circle it just makes it

9644.8 --> 9647.56
spatially

9648.24 --> 9651.6
interconnected in a

9651.72 --> 9658.679999999998
loop it tells you about the nature of

9654.52 --> 9658.68
the volume available and how it

9661.84 --> 9668.56
connects like a mobious

9664.96 --> 9670.479
band sure you can think of it like that

9668.56 --> 9672.519999999999
but I mean even a Mobius band is still

9670.479 --> 9675.84
assumed to be

9672.52 --> 9678.359
circular right cuz all those things all

9675.84 --> 9682.2
hold on to a physicality assumption bias

9678.359 --> 9682.2
that things can only

9684.56 --> 9690.72
exist in

9687.68 --> 9695.52
yeah it's basically all just assuming

9690.72 --> 9695.519999999999
like no a loop within space can't

9701.399 --> 9710.76
exist but I mean yeah maybe a Mobius

9705.12 --> 9710.76
strip is is the right word for it

9711.12 --> 9716.08
but I mean even in the visualizations of

9713.52 --> 9718.52
that they always eventually just make it

9716.08 --> 9718.52
into a

9723.08 --> 9727.92
circle they might say it's like a circle

9725.68 --> 9731.12
in the fourth dimension or something

9727.92 --> 9732.88
right wherever they go they just try to

9731.12 --> 9735.0
accommodate for any physicality

9732.88 --> 9738.479
assumption bias that will

9735.0 --> 9742.16
be affected will be activated by the

9738.479 --> 9742.16
mere notion of a looping

9744.6 --> 9750.439
space right we're not used to thinking

9748.399 --> 9752.64
of things as looping we're used to

9750.439 --> 9756.16
thinking of things as just being there

9752.64 --> 9758.84
as is within an available

9756.16 --> 9762.119999999999
volume we don't like to think that maybe

9758.84 --> 9763.960000000001
the available volume is interconnecting

9762.12 --> 9766.2
with

9763.96 --> 9771.319
itself in a straight

9766.2 --> 9776.0
line cuz like we don't see

9771.319 --> 9779.0
that we we never experience that at at

9776.0 --> 9779.0
the scale of our

9784.64 --> 9789.039999999999
perception right if we could see

9787.52 --> 9793.04
infinitely

9789.04 --> 9796.319000000001
far without the air or whatever diluting

9793.04 --> 9798.52
the distance for us well then we might

9796.319 --> 9800.24
see if we're in a loop if you could

9798.52 --> 9803.0
literally see see infinitely you could

9800.24 --> 9805.96
see like 100,000 miles and you could

9803.0 --> 9808.08
still see there well then you could

9805.96 --> 9810.0
perhaps see its looping because it's

9808.08 --> 9811.88
like you're seeing yourself again in the

9810.0 --> 9813.64
mirror in the mirror over distance oh

9811.88 --> 9816.759999999998
you see yourself again you see yourself

9813.64 --> 9820.399
again you see yourself again beyond that

9816.76 --> 9824.04
right that way you could see the

9820.399 --> 9827.72
loop but we can't see infinitely

9824.04 --> 9830.800000000001
far so we could never see far enough in

9827.72 --> 9833.679999999998
order to establish in one

9830.8 --> 9836.72
view that it's

9833.68 --> 9839.399
looping cuz you can't see far

9836.72 --> 9842.92
enough we can see the stars yeah but you

9839.399 --> 9842.92
don't know what the stars are

9847.0 --> 9852.24
though you're just seeing lights at

9849.64 --> 9855.319
Angles that's

9852.24 --> 9857.8
it that's the only evidence you can

9855.319 --> 9859.519999999999
presuppose whatever they are but you

9857.8 --> 9862.16
don't have evidence for that it's not

9859.52 --> 9862.16
going to help

9863.72 --> 9867.8
you Suns yeah

9877.76 --> 9881.92
sure the point is that we can see them

9880.399 --> 9885.479
yeah whatever they

9881.92 --> 9886.399
are and I can tell you whatever they are

9885.479 --> 9889.64
they're

9886.399 --> 9890.72
not billions of hundreds of thousands of

9889.64 --> 9895.039999999999
light years

9890.72 --> 9899.76
away cuz you can't see that far nothing

9895.04 --> 9902.76
can see that far sight cannot be that

9899.76 --> 9902.76
far

9904.319 --> 9908.92
universally just because you presuppose

9906.8 --> 9911.16
that they're that far away and you can

9908.92 --> 9914.12
still see them at that distance doesn't

9911.16 --> 9915.92
mean that you can actually see anything

9914.12 --> 9918.279
at that kind of a

9915.92 --> 9920.12
distance you're just presupposing that

9918.279 --> 9922.880000000001
you can because you're

9920.12 --> 9925.76
assuming your model in which those

9922.88 --> 9925.759999999998
distances are

9930.08 --> 9935.359
intricate they're a default part of the

9932.8 --> 9938.199999999999
heliocentric model the astronomical

9935.359 --> 9938.2
distances that are

9943.6 --> 9949.76
assumed how do you know we can't see

9946.24 --> 9953.279
that far because we can't see

9949.76 --> 9956.960000000001
at actual measured proven

9953.279 --> 9961.279
distances of that distance

9956.96 --> 9963.399
like yeah you can only see the stars

9961.279 --> 9965.16
that are so incredibly far away because

9963.399 --> 9966.84
you're assuming those stars are so

9965.16 --> 9969.2
incredibly far away that's the only

9966.84 --> 9972.279
example of where you can actually do it

9969.2 --> 9974.68
because when you do it on Earth where

9972.279 --> 9977.84
you could actually measure the distances

9974.68 --> 9980.800000000001
to what you're looking at provably well

9977.84 --> 9984.399
then at a certain distance you don't see

9980.8 --> 9990.039999999999
anything anymore under any

9984.399 --> 9990.039999999999
circumstance yeah CU you have a limit to

10318.16 --> 10322.479

10776.16 --> 10781.8
idea part of the heliocentric conception

I mean they got plenty of CGI to

10781.8 --> 10785.8
represent the idea they don't know how

10784.2 --> 10789.0
that's possible they can't present

10785.8 --> 10792.358999999999
evidence for that other than the CGI and

10789.0 --> 10793.96
telling you how it's supposed to

10792.359 --> 10797.479000000001
