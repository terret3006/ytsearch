106.619 --> 112.32
it's not like a hard rain or anything

109.2 --> 115.38
it's just a bit drippy and gray soup up

112.32 --> 116.63999999999999
there clouds do seem to be rushing

115.38 --> 118.44
I think the clouds are probably

116.64 --> 124.02
relatively low to the ground

118.44 --> 126.619
[Music]

124.02 --> 126.619

155.819 --> 162.06
it's Monday the 20th of March 2023

163.75 --> 166.81
[Music]

168.54 --> 172.44
feel like it's going to be one of those

170.28 --> 174.959
Mondays

172.44 --> 177.54
with this kind of weather ah well maybe

174.959 --> 179.64000000000001
not I don't know maybe it'll just switch

177.54 --> 182.78
around again at the end of the show

179.64 --> 182.77999999999997
you'll see

182.879 --> 185.84
who knows

188.04 --> 191.85
right but yeah yesterday

190.44 --> 193.2
show was great

191.85 --> 197.29999999999998
[Music]

193.2 --> 197.29999999999998
and let's see

197.32 --> 206.239
[Music]

201.42 --> 206.23899999999998
it was flat side show that was fun

207.86 --> 214.37900000000002
to yeah trigger trolls in chat

212.64 --> 217.07999999999998
a lot

214.379 --> 219.659
and then later and yeah it was a bit

217.08 --> 223.019
problematic but it was fun though Huey

219.659 --> 225.54
live QR started the treatment

223.019 --> 228.84
on a Sunday evening

225.54 --> 232.739
well to me it was it was really late and

228.84 --> 234.42000000000002
yeah it did keep me up a bit so

232.739 --> 236.64000000000001
I think it's probably part of the reason

234.42 --> 238.879
why my voice seems a little lower than

236.64 --> 238.879
normal

239.519 --> 242.299
because it just

242.879 --> 248.099
didn't really get to bed all that early

245.099 --> 251.78
thanks to QE but it was it was fun I

248.099 --> 254.51899999999998
mean he plucked out this this couple

251.78 --> 256.32
from somewhere I don't know where he

254.519 --> 259.56
gets these

256.32 --> 262.8
but they were like so idiotic it was

259.56 --> 266.46
just beyond belief

262.8 --> 269.54
this forest and given figure

266.46 --> 269.53999999999996
oh my God

270.0 --> 273.24
so yeah

271.56 --> 275.94
[Music]

273.24 --> 277.86
it just seems like the the amount of

275.94 --> 280.14
nutty people out there that are getting

277.86 --> 281.40000000000003
highly promoted is just

280.14 --> 283.28
[Music]

281.4 --> 285.479
like it's only getting worse

283.28 --> 288.73999999999995
[Music]

285.479 --> 291.8
like where do you get these guys

288.74 --> 291.8

bad I mean I'm seeing people

349.44 --> 352.86
without any rain clothes or anything

351.419 --> 356.29999999999995
just going

352.86 --> 356.3
about out there

357.3 --> 361.56

thank you

564.42 --> 567.26
foreign

575.57 --> 578.619
[Music]

596.0 --> 601.2
anyway so yeah I'm distracted I'm

598.5 --> 604.88
watching Dutch article here from a guy

601.2 --> 604.88
that Dutch man

606.84 --> 614.22
[Music]

608.459 --> 616.6199999999999
who has had very interesting ideas

614.22 --> 618.62
comes yeah like concerning country and

616.62 --> 621.72
politics and all that and he's basically

618.62 --> 625.019
saying what I've been saying or what I

621.72 --> 628.44
Loosely suspected

625.019 --> 631.76
that this main party that's like won the

628.44 --> 631.7600000000001
election here supposedly

635.88 --> 643.2
has the same acronyms build back better

640.56 --> 645.779
right and he is saying like no they're

643.2 --> 648.4200000000001
actually controlled opposition and

645.779 --> 650.82
they're going to eventually just work

648.42 --> 652.92
together with the cartel

650.82 --> 655.74
that's really shocking it's also

652.92 --> 658.079
explaining why nobody is complaining

655.74 --> 660.72
about the election apparently nobody is

658.079 --> 665.04
even though like form for democracy has

660.72 --> 667.44
been completely just erased out of it

665.04 --> 669.899
but even they themselves don't seem to

667.44 --> 674.24
be complaining about it it's all just

669.899 --> 674.24
not good this is all not good

689.279 --> 692.279
okay

705.06 --> 710.899
hey steamy Traveler

708.06 --> 710.899
good to see you

712.38 --> 717.6
you're going to watch the newly what

715.98 --> 720.66
what

717.6 --> 724.339
are you talking about steamy Traveler

720.66 --> 724.3389999999999
what new DND movie

726.72 --> 731.82
the great recess being called the failed

729.06 --> 733.41
reset do I agree no

731.82 --> 736.47
no absolutely not

733.41 --> 736.4699999999999
[Music]

738.36 --> 743.279
just because everybody's on to it

740.579 --> 745.5
doesn't mean that they can't steal just

743.279 --> 747.24
force it through anyway

745.5 --> 749.82
right

747.24 --> 751.98
I mean it'll depend per reach it but I

749.82 --> 754.2600000000001
mean I got a really bad feeling about

751.98 --> 758.0600000000001
this here I have had

754.26 --> 758.06
but what's like

760.38 --> 764.48
this election was no turnaround

769.019 --> 775.38
it's gonna seem like things are right

771.66 --> 777.48
for a while and then it's gonna be right

775.38 --> 780.86
back on the railroad where where it left

777.48 --> 780.86
off right back

781.019 --> 785.76
the massive

783.0 --> 787.92
shock of betrayal basically from a whole

785.76 --> 791.519
bunch of people

787.92 --> 793.68
and then then it's on that's what I

791.519 --> 798.98
think is gonna happen

793.68 --> 798.9799999999999
Dungeons and Dragons movie Okay so

802.32 --> 805.22
you know

806.04 --> 810.86
that's the characters in there oh goody

813.48 --> 821.399
or honorable please

818.16 --> 823.86
so is this like an official continuation

821.399 --> 826.32
of the Dungeons and Dragons movie

823.86 --> 828.72
franchise

826.32 --> 830.88
because it looks like it could be the as

828.72 --> 832.38
greatest Dungeons and Dragons too did

830.88 --> 835.5
you know there was a third one too

832.38 --> 838.32
people don't even know that

835.5 --> 841.76
I think on average

838.32 --> 841.7600000000001
but I mean I yeah

841.98 --> 846.54
wait what am I saying no the second one

844.26 --> 849.899
is actually better the first one was

846.54 --> 849.899
just horrendous

850.019 --> 853.62
yeah horrendous

851.79 --> 856.62
[Music]

853.62 --> 859.26
it wasn't even a good representation of

856.62 --> 862.5600000000001
the Indie it was like the worst things

859.26 --> 865.26
that DND started out with the stupid

862.56 --> 867.5999999999999
tropes that people were annoyed about

865.26 --> 869.8199999999999
and nerds really loved back then for

867.6 --> 872.339
some reason yeah that's the first movie

869.82 --> 873.9590000000001
it's all the bad parts of DnD all

872.339 --> 877.8000000000001
crammed together all the things you

873.959 --> 881.88
don't want about d d in that movie

877.8 --> 884.459
terrible it is arguably for me one of

881.88 --> 888.12
the worst fantasy movies I've ever seen

884.459 --> 890.279
because it's so wrong everything about

888.12 --> 893.76
it is wrong

890.279 --> 897.18
yeah the second however I did like

893.76 --> 900.3
second one was pretty Epic

897.18 --> 903.4799999999999
the third one was they got kind of dark

900.3 --> 905.9399999999999
and was like it didn't really work it

903.48 --> 907.1990000000001
was all just kind of pretentious evil it

905.94 --> 909.9590000000001
was annoying

907.199 --> 913.3199999999999
not well not it was like

909.959 --> 915.899
okay it just didn't really work so this

913.32 --> 919.1990000000001
fourth one or maybe there's been another

915.899 --> 922.139
one I haven't even noticed

919.199 --> 924.42
I don't know man my expectations are

922.139 --> 926.88
extremely mixed

924.42 --> 930.0
I mean it could be lame it could be

926.88 --> 932.579
hysterical it could be really cool it

930.0 --> 936.32
could be really annoying so

932.579 --> 936.3199999999999
any combination of those

938.279 --> 941.62
it all depends on the vision of the

940.32 --> 943.2600000000001
Riders

941.62 --> 946.32
[Music]

943.26 --> 948.67
and the director anyway hey Kevlar good

no I haven't had Brenda on I canceled

953.82 --> 957.36
that

955.44 --> 959.399
because she insists that she wanted to

957.36 --> 961.74
talk about her and she keeps emailing me

959.399 --> 965.88
too I'm telling her like no

961.74 --> 968.519
no piss off like and she's like please

965.88 --> 969.36
oh you're scared to oh they like [ __ ]

968.519 --> 970.8
off

969.36 --> 974.48
Ben

970.8 --> 977.559
block go away

974.48 --> 977.559
[Music]

978.92 --> 986.0
so I'm not going to and yeah Gadget

982.56 --> 986.0
inspector can go [ __ ] himself

992.5 --> 998.62
[Music]

999.3 --> 1004.9399999999999
she has a shoe yeah I don't care I don't

1002.72 --> 1006.9200000000001
want to talk her with her about physics

1004.94 --> 1010.94
or Flat Earth

1006.92 --> 1012.86
or the Flat Earth Community I don't give

1010.94 --> 1017.3000000000001
a [ __ ] I don't want to talk with her

1012.86 --> 1018.0790000000001
about psychology of of these groups at

1017.3 --> 1019.779
all

1018.079 --> 1022.2199999999999
I'll talk to her

1019.779 --> 1025.88
exclusively about

1022.22 --> 1028.4
the transgenderism phenomenon and how

1025.88 --> 1031.5200000000002
she began that's the only thing I care

1028.4 --> 1034.5790000000002
to talk about with her and that is it

1031.52 --> 1036.26
and after that that will also be it like

1034.579 --> 1038.8999999999999
I don't want to talk to her that's the

1036.26 --> 1041.48
only thing I would potentially get her

1038.9 --> 1044.299
on my show with about

1041.48 --> 1047.3600000000001
and that's it

1044.299 --> 1048.439
because I have absolutely no interest in

1047.36 --> 1050.299
anything

1048.439 --> 1053.799
outside of that

1050.299 --> 1053.799
in order to talk with her

1054.08 --> 1061.22
right because I do not want to go and in

1058.34 --> 1063.1999999999998
some stupid sparring situation with her

1061.22 --> 1065.3600000000001
like she really likes to do because

1063.2 --> 1067.76
she'll never stop she tires everybody

1065.36 --> 1071.36
out she'll get on my nerves and then

1067.76 --> 1073.4
there's just yeah just know why the [ __ ]

1071.36 --> 1075.9799999999998
would I do that

1073.4 --> 1077.7800000000002
seen it so many times

1075.98 --> 1079.7
happening I don't want to do that

1077.78 --> 1081.9189999999999
anymore it's a complete waste of

1079.7 --> 1084.559
everybody's time it's not even funny

1081.919 --> 1087.22
it's just annoying

1084.559 --> 1087.22
so

1088.4 --> 1091.439
[Music]

1092.6 --> 1097.6399999999999
who is Brenda oh well be glad that you

1095.299 --> 1100.1
don't know

1097.64 --> 1101.72
Brenda's been like associate or been

1100.1 --> 1103.82
entangled with like the Flat Earth

1101.72 --> 1107.55
debate way back even

1103.82 --> 1108.98
and she's one of the she's transgender

1107.55 --> 1110.4189999999999
[Music]

1108.98 --> 1112.22
yeah

1110.419 --> 1115.4
and

1112.22 --> 1117.26
like really [ __ ] up

1115.4 --> 1120.6200000000001
kind of

1117.26 --> 1123.14
yeah it's hard to tell like she has like

1120.62 --> 1126.02
an SGA w a fanatic side especially when

1123.14 --> 1128.179
she gets agitated that comes forth and

1126.02 --> 1130.22
really totally rearrange it like she

1128.179 --> 1132.44
doesn't have any real personal stability

1130.22 --> 1134.48
Foundation at all

1132.44 --> 1137.179
and that might seem that for example

1134.48 --> 1139.22
when I get angry I get it dark

1137.179 --> 1141.44
but yeah

1139.22 --> 1144.38
I definitely have a foundation

1141.44 --> 1147.6200000000001
underneath that she's just whatever she

1144.38 --> 1150.74
is in the moment when she gets angry

1147.62 --> 1152.299
and she'll hold on to that like she I

1150.74 --> 1153.799
don't know if she even notices the

1152.299 --> 1156.3799999999999
difference I don't know

1153.799 --> 1158.72
maybe she does maybe she chooses not to

1156.38 --> 1160.7600000000002
but she just likes to [ __ ] around with

1158.72 --> 1164.299
people's heads all the time and she's a

1160.76 --> 1167.12
complete philosophical solipsist

1164.299 --> 1169.8799999999999
is absolutely no

1167.12 --> 1173.6599999999999
positive angle

1169.88 --> 1176.72
to her mental Heritage like no positive

1173.66 --> 1178.7
angle at all with anything it's terrible

1176.72 --> 1181.46
person

1178.7 --> 1185.14
terrible to be around

1181.46 --> 1185.14
if you're forced to talk with her

1186.1 --> 1190.9599999999998
and she probably doesn't even mean to be

1189.86 --> 1195.2199999999998
that

1190.96 --> 1195.22
obnoxious but she just is

1201.52 --> 1208.84
really she's already I don't care it's

1204.919 --> 1208.8400000000001
it's old goes into spam now

1213.32 --> 1218.78
that she's been trying to contact me

1216.14 --> 1221.24
like on discords you send me messages

1218.78 --> 1224.8999999999999
and

1221.24 --> 1227.24
and in chaps other people's chat see at

1224.9 --> 1229.22
she just I don't know she's like oh

1227.24 --> 1231.74
really wants to talk with me or

1229.22 --> 1234.14
something I [ __ ] off

1231.74 --> 1235.28
not gonna be your friend

1234.14 --> 1237.5
yeah

1235.28 --> 1239.1789999999999
just because I happen to have some

1237.5 --> 1242.179
friends in the past

1239.179 --> 1244.2800000000002
that was kind of close to mentally that

1242.179 --> 1249.26
happened to be trans doesn't mean that

1244.28 --> 1251.98
oh I really like trans friends no yes

1249.26 --> 1251.98
off

1256.88 --> 1260.15
go away

1258.5 --> 1263.199
leave me alone

1260.15 --> 1263.199
[Music]

1266.4 --> 1271.1000000000001
[Music]

1268.16 --> 1275.729
not gonna negotiate with you

1271.1 --> 1275.7289999999998
[Music]

1276.919 --> 1279.4
anyway

1283.78 --> 1287.5
lack of awareness

1289.7 --> 1295.52
well it look lack of awareness is very

1293.0 --> 1299.059
hard to truly pinpoint out

1295.52 --> 1302.059
but she seems to have a very typical

1299.059 --> 1304.34
like spiritual dislocation in a way that

1302.059 --> 1307.3999999999999
she just

1304.34 --> 1310.22
doesn't know where it's at

1307.4 --> 1312.799
as in what

1310.22 --> 1314.9
a composure

1312.799 --> 1317.24
like at all

1314.9 --> 1319.1000000000001
because she is just Brenda and she's

1317.24 --> 1321.22
always the same

1319.1 --> 1324.74
that's what it seems like she doesn't

1321.22 --> 1327.98
connect well to

1324.74 --> 1330.98
group thinking

1327.98 --> 1333.32
she tries to rule group thinking that's

1330.98 --> 1337.88
what she attempts

1333.32 --> 1340.9399999999998
constantly taking a crowd leading

1337.88 --> 1342.3700000000001
trying to bind everybody there but she's

1340.94 --> 1344.48
ugh I don't know man

1342.37 --> 1347.7199999999998
[Music]

1344.48 --> 1350.0
I mean maybe maybe she has like another

1347.72 --> 1353.0
attitude to she has at work or something

1350.0 --> 1355.22
and she's much more dormant

1353.0 --> 1358.28
but out here on the internet she just

1355.22 --> 1361.1000000000001
likes to Walt in and get in everybody's

1358.28 --> 1364.039
face and be obnoxious

1361.1 --> 1366.799
get all the attention she basically an

1364.039 --> 1369.52
attention [ __ ] like that

1366.799 --> 1369.52
foreign

1369.559 --> 1375.62
so anyway but enough about that

1373.53 --> 1377.78
[Music]

1375.62 --> 1381.06
I mean there's more to it but I don't

1377.78 --> 1383.78
want to I don't want to talk about it

1381.06 --> 1388.52
[Music]

1383.78 --> 1393.22
every little detail I give out would be

1388.52 --> 1393.22
a pearl thrown before a swine

1398.6 --> 1403.339
ah

1400.21 --> 1403.339
[Music]

1405.98 --> 1413.0
he's trying to be something he well I

1409.46 --> 1414.559
don't care you know he she I call it a

1413.0 --> 1417.22
she

1414.559 --> 1417.22
whatever

1418.29 --> 1421.349
[Music]

1422.12 --> 1428.7199999999998
conversation yes yeah well yeah so you

1425.36 --> 1432.34
can start but I mean Brenda is just

1428.72 --> 1432.34
look when she does that

1432.62 --> 1437.11
she's just playing a game you see she's

1435.86 --> 1440.08
playing

1437.11 --> 1443.7199999999998
[Music]

1440.08 --> 1446.6
it's like proto-science this is like

1443.72 --> 1449.299
little children science thinking it's

1446.6 --> 1451.28
just like oh mechanics of thinking and

1449.299 --> 1453.02
also you can think whatever you want

1451.28 --> 1454.58
right

1453.02 --> 1458.0
she's just

1454.58 --> 1459.799
being very unappropriately creative

1458.0 --> 1463.4
about it

1459.799 --> 1465.4
as in arts school creative not

1463.4 --> 1468.02
constructive

1465.4 --> 1470.96
philosophically constructive creative so

1468.02 --> 1474.08
she's just being oh whatever you could

1470.96 --> 1476.6000000000001
do whatever Art School liberal that's

1474.08 --> 1478.1
how she philosophizes sometimes she

1476.6 --> 1479.8999999999999
connects things up and other times it

1478.1 --> 1480.9699999999998
just makes absolutely no sense

1479.9 --> 1482.1200000000001
whatsoever

1480.97 --> 1485.919
[Music]

1482.12 --> 1485.9189999999999
and I don't think she even cares

1486.2 --> 1491.6200000000001
right enough though

1489.02 --> 1491.62
uh

1497.6 --> 1505.12
she is she nah

1501.2 --> 1505.1200000000001
no I don't care look

1506.12 --> 1514.82
I just don't have obstacles calling Ben

1511.4 --> 1517.5800000000002
that are like that

1514.82 --> 1520.28
that have transitioned I have no trouble

1517.58 --> 1522.9189999999999
calling them a she

1520.28 --> 1524.779
especially if they actually remove their

1522.919 --> 1527.9
you know what

1524.779 --> 1531.88
because it's like yeah

1527.9 --> 1531.88
I'm not like attracted

1532.039 --> 1536.12
but I mean it's not really a man anymore

1534.86 --> 1538.539
is it

1536.12 --> 1538.539
right

1539.36 --> 1543.5
the other way around with

1541.52 --> 1545.36
female to male transition now that's

1543.5 --> 1548.12
another story like that's really

1545.36 --> 1551.7199999999998
Troublesome for me because I just have

1548.12 --> 1554.4189999999999
so yeah intuitive impulses from them

1551.72 --> 1558.799
that they are female it's like my system

1554.419 --> 1561.919
detects their female presence like

1558.799 --> 1565.279
so I always like keep calling them she

1561.919 --> 1566.96
again but that's not because it's just a

1565.279 --> 1569.36
jersey now it's just because my system

1566.96 --> 1571.82
is scrambling up the signals I don't

1569.36 --> 1573.6789999999999
have that issue with men to female

1571.82 --> 1574.6399999999999
transition I'm just like no you're just

1573.679 --> 1576.799
a she

1574.64 --> 1579.98
like I have no trouble with that because

1576.799 --> 1582.26
it's not exactly a man anymore now is it

1579.98 --> 1585.64
right so that's

1582.26 --> 1585.64
oh that works for me

1585.76 --> 1591.679
[Music]

1588.14 --> 1593.5700000000002
so in general I'm inclined to call All

1591.679 --> 1596.63
Trans people she

1593.57 --> 1596.6299999999999
[Music]

1596.84 --> 1599.6789999999999
it's how it is

1600.799 --> 1608.779
it's the other she

1603.48 --> 1610.22
[Music]

1608.779 --> 1612.98
ah

1610.22 --> 1615.58
[Music]

1612.98 --> 1615.58
anyway

1617.8 --> 1620.849
[Music]

1623.28 --> 1632.74
[Music]

1629.48 --> 1634.52
why don't people always have to ask

1632.74 --> 1637.34
[Music]

1634.52 --> 1641.179
is it muted or is it my phone like you

1637.34 --> 1644.48
could just check it and then not ask and

1641.179 --> 1646.02
then if it persists

1644.48 --> 1647.96
yeah then I'd ask

1646.02 --> 1649.24
[Music]

1647.96 --> 1651.8600000000001
anyway

1649.24 --> 1655.659
[Music]

1651.86 --> 1655.6589999999999
the soul isn't I don't care

1656.48 --> 1659.679
it's not my problem

1666.919 --> 1672.22
when does the Netherlands have daylight

1668.779 --> 1672.22
saving time I'm not sure

1672.53 --> 1678.52
[Music]

1674.72 --> 1678.52
could be like in a week or two

1679.55 --> 1682.579
[Music]

1685.0 --> 1689.609
[Music]

1690.14 --> 1694.76
or maybe like next week right yeah makes

1692.84 --> 1696.7099999999998
sense it's usually on a Sunday they do

1694.76 --> 1704.6
it

1696.71 --> 1707.24
[Music]

1704.6 --> 1711.1399999999999
takes two weeks right and it was last

1707.24 --> 1713.179
week it changed in America so yeah it

1711.14 --> 1715.96
makes sense that

1713.179 --> 1715.96
next Sunday

1719.5 --> 1723.52
start at 4am here

1724.4 --> 1727.0590000000002
uh

1727.159 --> 1730.9
it should be the same time

1734.179 --> 1741.44
I mean now I'm starting an hour late

1738.38 --> 1745.22
this this last week for America because

1741.44 --> 1748.039
they've just went an hour earlier it

1745.22 --> 1750.88
doesn't change anything

1748.039 --> 1750.8799999999999
oh man

1758.84 --> 1762.1589999999999
should wizard

1762.32 --> 1770.1399999999999
kind of story she was weird

1766.1 --> 1770.1399999999999
freaking spring transition

1775.58 --> 1782.299
probably has to do with like the

1779.299 --> 1785.24
like a bit working out

1782.299 --> 1789.1
and all that

1785.24 --> 1789.1
start up X

1805.82 --> 1808.36
foreign

1814.34 --> 1820.82
that does not sound good

1817.76 --> 1822.08
I wonder what that is that some muscle

1820.82 --> 1824.1789999999999
just

1822.08 --> 1826.899
getting in the way

1824.179 --> 1826.8990000000001
ah

1834.919 --> 1840.3400000000001
yeah luckily my legs are not having that

1837.919 --> 1840.3400000000001
issue

1840.62 --> 1845.1499999999999
but yeah I think feel like my shoulders

1842.659 --> 1869.679
are just a bit like

1845.15 --> 1873.0800000000002
[Music]

1869.679 --> 1877.24
all right anyway it's early

1873.08 --> 1877.24
but I mean it is the early bird show

1877.46 --> 1880.24
ah

1884.059 --> 1889.82
tomorrow I'll be probably a bit more

1887.48 --> 1892.1
rested

1889.82 --> 1894.2
so do I don't know I did have a really

1892.1 --> 1896.26
good sleep though but

1894.2 --> 1896.26
um

1900.62 --> 1905.6589999999999
I think it's just a day

1902.899 --> 1907.6399999999999
I might call My Healer after this I

1905.659 --> 1909.14
think that would be a good idea also to

1907.64 --> 1912.0800000000002
cross Jack

1909.14 --> 1914.72
[Music]

1912.08 --> 1916.96
like what I've been doing because I

1914.72 --> 1918.919
don't know how well it's been working

1916.96 --> 1921.919
[Music]

1918.919 --> 1924.0800000000002
like the the extra discipline of

1921.919 --> 1925.3400000000001
basically putting my spirit back in my

1924.08 --> 1928.899
body is

1925.34 --> 1928.899
yeah it's what it is

1929.48 --> 1933.8600000000001
[Music]

1931.039 --> 1935.6589999999999
but it is basically a mental focus based

1933.86 --> 1938.84
exercise

1935.659 --> 1940.7
but I think it has been working in ways

1938.84 --> 1943.48
but in other ways it just

1940.7 --> 1943.48
I don't know

1944.899 --> 1949.279
I don't know yeah

1946.64 --> 1951.7990000000002
so anyway

1949.279 --> 1954.919
man I see him a little flustered but I'm

1951.799 --> 1957.679
I don't feel lost it it's just my body

1954.919 --> 1959.0900000000001
is just like like hello here this hello

1957.679 --> 1962.179
here that and

1959.09 --> 1964.6399999999999

1962.179 --> 1976.299

2031.0 --> 2034.84
huh

2032.32 --> 2039.539
I missed that one

2034.84 --> 2039.539
wait no wait it is Monday

2039.88 --> 2047.019
yeah Owen had another burner Channel

2044.08 --> 2050.2599999999998
show that apparently I or maybe he just

2047.019 --> 2052.659
uploaded it I don't know

2050.26 --> 2054.7000000000003
it says Saturday

2052.659 --> 2057.48
so I missed out on that for some reason

2054.7 --> 2057.48
weird

2057.639 --> 2063.96
looking up about them Chemtrails what do

2061.179 --> 2063.96
you think they're real

2065.5 --> 2071.44
well I know there's like weather

2068.58 --> 2074.02
modification happening Oz I mean it's

2071.44 --> 2076.06
been happening since 95.

2074.02 --> 2078.339
but this claim of

2076.06 --> 2082.32
barium salt

2078.339 --> 2082.32
and aluminum oxides

2083.52 --> 2088.359
that kind of thing

2086.32 --> 2090.7000000000003
I don't know I don't know if that is

2088.359 --> 2093.159
actually what they use it seems like

2090.7 --> 2095.379
that makes no sense and if they have

2093.159 --> 2099.119
been using it for that long that means

2095.379 --> 2099.1189999999997
like almost 30 years guys

2099.16 --> 2108.7599999999998
of that happening regularly that's going

2103.24 --> 2112.9599999999996
to like palpably poison the soil

2108.76 --> 2115.3590000000004
it means just 30 years

2112.96 --> 2118.0
happening period That's it's going to

2115.359 --> 2119.859
add up you're going to measure it and I

2118.0 --> 2122.68
don't think it is measured like that

2119.859 --> 2125.3199999999997
it's not like yeah the standard soil

2122.68 --> 2128.9199999999996
content of barium salt and aluminum

2125.32 --> 2131.6400000000003
oxide I mean it's not there

2128.92 --> 2131.64
it isn't

2134.2 --> 2138.7799999999997
so

2135.82 --> 2141.579
I don't know I think that potentially

2138.78 --> 2144.94
those components might have been used

2141.579 --> 2148.599
very specifically in like a test phase

2144.94 --> 2151.54
in certain regions

2148.599 --> 2153.7000000000003
where they I don't know probably try to

2151.54 --> 2155.8
also weaponize combine it with harp

2153.7 --> 2157.48
technology and all that I mean you know

2155.8 --> 2159.46
the conspiracy theories about all that

2157.48 --> 2162.22
and there is something to that

2159.46 --> 2164.98
but does that mean that that is what is

2162.22 --> 2167.859
used as a standard

2164.98 --> 2172.72
doesn't seem like it because

2167.859 --> 2176.2599999999998
it would just poison the soil everywhere

2172.72 --> 2179.9199999999996
it's not like you can aim that [ __ ]

2176.26 --> 2182.5600000000004
it's gonna settle on everything

2179.92 --> 2184.839
if you do that continually it's gonna

2182.56 --> 2185.7999999999997
toxify the soil like everything's gonna

2184.839 --> 2190.24
die

2185.8 --> 2191.8590000000004
okay so it seems like that's not what is

2190.24 --> 2194.4599999999996
happening that's why I just call them

2191.859 --> 2194.46
trails

2194.74 --> 2198.9599999999996
they are persistent they're not

2197.02 --> 2203.339
condensation Trails they don't just

2198.96 --> 2203.339
dissolve back into the air

2203.44 --> 2208.2400000000002
sometimes that does happen then it is

2205.48 --> 2211.2400000000002
condensation Trails right you see a

2208.24 --> 2214.2999999999997
little a little line but like the plane

2211.24 --> 2217.24
it just it dissolves at a kind of a

2214.3 --> 2219.4
standard distance that's a condensation

2217.24 --> 2222.22
Trail

2219.4 --> 2225.82
but if they don't dissolve and they then

2222.22 --> 2228.64
kind of like spread out like feathers

2225.82 --> 2231.46
then it is a persistent Trail but if

2228.64 --> 2232.7799999999997
that is the aluminum oxide and barium

2231.46 --> 2235.42
salt

2232.78 --> 2238.4100000000003
I don't know I don't think so

2235.42 --> 2240.7000000000003
because that happens regularly

2238.41 --> 2244.2999999999997
[Music]

2240.7 --> 2247.9199999999996
and it like for 30 years so that would

2244.3 --> 2247.92
poison the soil and it isn't poison

2252.88 --> 2259.48
right so I

2255.18 --> 2262.359
argue that maybe they're like just using

2259.48 --> 2265.77
sand dust or something

2262.359 --> 2267.88
just find silicon

2265.77 --> 2271.119
[Music]

2267.88 --> 2273.46
like the cloud seating system

2271.119 --> 2275.98
dust

2273.46 --> 2278.92
dust for

2275.98 --> 2281.2
moist particles that latch onto and then

2278.92 --> 2284.02
form clouds

2281.2 --> 2286.5989999999997
I mean it arguably that is how it

2284.02 --> 2289.96
happened in nature it's like oh the

2286.599 --> 2291.46
Sahara Desert Sands of like blown at the

2289.96 --> 2293.56
high Stratosphere and they're coming

2291.46 --> 2295.839
down and then

2293.56 --> 2298.599
you have some sand on on your roof if

2295.839 --> 2300.96
it's a lot and but it also influences

2298.599 --> 2300.96
the weather

2301.66 --> 2308.04
might be storms and all that

2304.0 --> 2308.04
so yeah cloud seeding

2309.339 --> 2312.46
and there's other techniques too I mean

2311.44 --> 2315.339
like

2312.46 --> 2318.2400000000002
arguably in Houston like that device

2315.339 --> 2321.4
that supposedly NASA our engine test

2318.24 --> 2323.7999999999997
they blast off hydrogen that create

2321.4 --> 2327.6600000000003
that's literally a cloud making device

2323.8 --> 2330.2200000000003
suppose that rocket testing it's just

2327.66 --> 2331.54
pumping massive amounts of water in the

2330.22 --> 2336.0989999999997
air really

2331.54 --> 2341.14
[Music]

2336.099 --> 2344.03
right so that's not spraying that's just

2341.14 --> 2345.94
burning hydrogens

2344.03 --> 2350.28
[Music]

2345.94 --> 2350.28
and that also creates water just

2350.68 --> 2358.54
complete weather control yeah absolutely

2354.119 --> 2361.78
complete and total weather control

2358.54 --> 2363.7599999999998
arguably for 30 years although it's

2361.78 --> 2365.6800000000003
likely that at first they were still

2363.76 --> 2367.5400000000004
kind of testing they didn't really know

2365.68 --> 2369.94
what it would all do

2367.54 --> 2372.88
what I mean I'm pretty damn sure that in

2369.94 --> 2375.64
the last 20 years

2372.88 --> 2378.28
at least 10 years they definitely like

2375.64 --> 2379.96
that's just a standard they don't they

2378.28 --> 2382.1800000000003
probably got it algorithmic

2379.96 --> 2385.18
algorithmically

2382.18 --> 2387.04
stared like people don't even look at it

2385.18 --> 2389.3199999999997
anymore it just does what it does

2387.04 --> 2392.4
because

2389.32 --> 2392.4
it's just the program

2393.94 --> 2400.119
so that testing phase for weather

2396.64 --> 2403.359
control is definitely passed

2400.119 --> 2406.6600000000003
very certain of that

2403.359 --> 2408.88
so yeah complete weather control yeah

2406.66 --> 2410.859
complete weather control

2408.88 --> 2413.079
completely

2410.859 --> 2415.96
now that doesn't mean that they can just

2413.079 --> 2418.2400000000002
make the weather however they want it

2415.96 --> 2420.96
but it means that they are fully

2418.24 --> 2420.9599999999996
manipulating

2422.56 --> 2427.44
and probably even avoiding certain types

2425.2 --> 2427.4399999999996
of weather

2427.48 --> 2431.339
entirely

2428.859 --> 2431.339
yeah

2435.22 --> 2441.9399999999996
Force chips implants ever no

2439.3 --> 2446.5800000000004
there will be voluntary

2441.94 --> 2448.54
chip implants happening yeah

2446.58 --> 2451.359
[Music]

2448.54 --> 2454.3
I've yet to see any Force

2451.359 --> 2458.0989999999997
any Force the only force that seems to

2454.3 --> 2458.099
happen is in media hype

2460.06 --> 2465.0
please no yeah way

2462.04 --> 2465.0
complete way

2466.13 --> 2469.2090000000003
[Music]

2471.94 --> 2478.359
right but you can't make it whatever

2476.26 --> 2480.4
weather continually

2478.359 --> 2482.92
but I'm pretty sure they can make it

2480.4 --> 2486.2400000000002
snow in India

2482.92 --> 2486.2400000000002
they really wanted to

2486.579 --> 2490.5
but not all the time

2495.64 --> 2502.72
I mean you're gonna be dealing with the

2498.64 --> 2504.52
weather that typically is in the region

2502.72 --> 2507.5789999999997
you can nudge it

2504.52 --> 2510.579
can try to hold things off like hold off

2507.579 --> 2512.8
a drought or hold off

2510.579 --> 2514.78
like try to disperse the clouds if it

2512.8 --> 2517.0
gets too rainy like that kind of thing

2514.78 --> 2518.5
but you're gonna be working with weather

2517.0 --> 2520.72
control with the weather that's

2518.5 --> 2523.48
typically in the region anyway so it's

2520.72 --> 2526.359
not like oh wow let's just turn India

2523.48 --> 2530.46
into a moderate climate yes yeah no that

2526.359 --> 2530.46
doesn't work that way this is

2535.3 --> 2538.3
hmm

2538.72 --> 2541.8999999999996
[Music]

2543.66 --> 2548.8199999999997
what do I think of the salination ocean

2546.46 --> 2548.82
water

2548.859 --> 2552.959
uh

2549.9 --> 2552.9590000000003
[Music]

2553.119 --> 2556.98
well if it works it works

2559.48 --> 2562.92
I mean if it's

2563.92 --> 2569.099
there you go

2566.38 --> 2569.099
ah

2571.359 --> 2575.52
we freaking translated

2576.57 --> 2583.5
[Music]

2584.4 --> 2589.96
okay yeah well basically if it's

2587.02 --> 2591.64
profitable if it's

2589.96 --> 2596.079
uh

2591.64 --> 2598.42
a better way to attain water than just

2596.079 --> 2601.5600000000004
through another means then yes

2598.42 --> 2601.56
I'm all for it

2604.76 --> 2609.4
[Music]

2607.54 --> 2613.119
right

2609.4 --> 2615.42
but I mean if it is gonna be at the same

2613.119 --> 2619.2400000000002
level as like freaking

2615.42 --> 2621.04
windmills or solar panels then I'd say

2619.24 --> 2622.06
yeah you might want to find some other

2621.04 --> 2624.64
way

2622.06 --> 2626.92
because those things are just not they

2624.64 --> 2630.64
are very polluting actually

2626.92 --> 2632.92
they don't yield what you really need

2630.64 --> 2634.96
so I don't know

2632.92 --> 2639.0
I don't know how far

2634.96 --> 2642.33
the the engineering for

2639.0 --> 2643.48
desalinating ocean water

2642.33 --> 2645.46
[Music]

2643.48 --> 2647.8
how far it's come

2645.46 --> 2651.06
right and by the way it's it's I mean

2647.8 --> 2651.0600000000004
not just

2652.119 --> 2656.02
the water

2653.44 --> 2660.06
because also the minerals in the ocean

2656.02 --> 2660.06
itself might be interesting

2668.92 --> 2674.329
[Music]

2685.9 --> 2691.06
getting rid of the mineral waste

2689.26 --> 2695.5
yeah

2691.06 --> 2697.839
because minerals tend to like to stay in

2695.5 --> 2699.5
water it's like they dissolve in it and

2697.839 --> 2700.839
then they are very elusive

2699.5 --> 2703.66
[Music]

2700.839 --> 2707.38
but it's good you need minerals in water

2703.66 --> 2711.3999999999996
that makes it good drinking water

2707.38 --> 2713.619
right so I have like this ceramic filter

2711.4 --> 2715.7200000000003
that I've been using for what is it 20

2713.619 --> 2718.6600000000003
years or so

2715.72 --> 2720.2799999999997
at least 15.

2718.66 --> 2724.2999999999997
not the same element so they have to

2720.28 --> 2726.9
refresh it every like decade or whatever

2724.3 --> 2726.9
but

2727.119 --> 2734.02
yeah it filters out all garbage but it

2730.9 --> 2736.8
keeps the minerals in makes it excellent

2734.02 --> 2736.8
drinking water

2739.18 --> 2744.339
right and yeah if you then uh but I

2742.599 --> 2746.8590000000004
don't want the minerals in there because

2744.339 --> 2748.42
the minerals are bad or something bad

2746.859 --> 2751.2999999999997
minerals in there

2748.42 --> 2753.48
well then you'll have to like evaporate

2751.3 --> 2753.48
it

2755.68 --> 2758.68
right

2759.28 --> 2765.9900000000002
that's and then you yeah you separate

2762.4 --> 2772.17
pure water from the minerals

2765.99 --> 2772.1699999999996
[Music]

2783.96 --> 2794.05

2802.74 --> 2808.4199999999996
products harm the fields yeah

2805.01 --> 2811.25

2808.42 --> 2820.48
that is true

2811.25 --> 2824.319
[Music]

2820.48 --> 2826.54
yeah I mean if what is it in the Gulf I

2824.319 --> 2828.64
don't know is it still that bad from the

2826.54 --> 2830.56
gigantic oil spill and all the garbage

2828.64 --> 2832.5989999999997
they dumped in there and all that the

2830.56 --> 2835.2999999999997
giant BP

2832.599 --> 2837.099
oil rig blow up

2835.3 --> 2840.3590000000004
idiots

2837.099 --> 2845.099
like I'm you probably shouldn't

2840.359 --> 2845.0989999999997
desalinate the water from that region

2845.14 --> 2850.18
because it's going to be filled with

2846.94 --> 2852.7000000000003
that kind of terrible chemicals and

2850.18 --> 2855.7999999999997
and petroleum residues

2852.7 --> 2855.7999999999997
[Music]

2857.68 --> 2863.339
or did they clean it up I know I don't

2859.66 --> 2863.339
know what is the condition of that

2866.4 --> 2872.04
don't really hear about it a lot these

2869.92 --> 2872.04
days

2882.4 --> 2886.319
what are you talking about Oz

2886.37 --> 2889.42
[Music]

2893.38 --> 2898.78
[Music]

2899.56 --> 2904.599
yeah I know that George Sanford

2902.26 --> 2910.78
I'm asking

2904.599 --> 2910.78
what is the condition of the region now

2911.2 --> 2916.7999999999997
not what happened back then

2914.02 --> 2916.8
I know that

2920.02 --> 2923.25
[Music]

2925.96 --> 2930.46
I mean are there fishes swimming around

2928.96 --> 2932.98
again

2930.46 --> 2936.36
that will be a good indicator

2932.98 --> 2939.409
or is it just this dead region

2936.36 --> 2939.409
[Music]

2941.8 --> 2944.869
[Music]

2947.22 --> 2955.839
Fukushima if it was the real what no

2952.9 --> 2957.94
if it was real what do you mean it was

2955.839 --> 2964.359
real

2957.94 --> 2967.38
[Music]

2964.359 --> 2967.38
not destiny

2968.14 --> 2972.5789999999997
so there are actual fishes that still

2970.66 --> 2975.1189999999997
live there

2972.579 --> 2975.119
really

I mean what's happening then

2985.119 --> 2991.1800000000003
how is that possible it's like the oil

2988.9 --> 2994.599
is it gone

2991.18 --> 2996.04
or has it been like hardened at the

2994.599 --> 2997.839
bottom and like

2996.04 --> 2999.64
not leeching anything and just

2997.839 --> 3002.22
everything's living on top it like

2999.64 --> 3004.859
what's going on then

3002.22 --> 3007.2
is it all gone

3004.859 --> 3010.5
foreign

3007.2 --> 3013.02
I mean I do actually believe that raw

3010.5 --> 3014.099
oil does actually

3013.02 --> 3017.48
[Music]

3014.099 --> 3017.48
just get broken down

3022.14 --> 3027.839
it's when you start to chemically

separate [ __ ] about it that's when you

3027.839 --> 3032.7599999999998
get like problems that it becomes

3030.54 --> 3036.839
unnatural and then doesn't break down

3032.76 --> 3040.5
anymore but raw oil in itself

3036.839 --> 3042.599
I think that actually Nature has ability

3040.5 --> 3044.52
to deal with that I mean they would have

3042.599 --> 3047.2200000000003
to

3044.52 --> 3050.04
nature would have to because Oil Springs

3047.22 --> 3052.74
up naturally in tar pits and all that

3050.04 --> 3054.9
that's in nature if if nature couldn't

3052.74 --> 3056.64
dissolve it then eventually the entire

3054.9 --> 3059.339
world would be covered by oil and

3056.64 --> 3061.74
everything would be dead

3059.339 --> 3062.73
so there is a way to break down oil

3061.74 --> 3065.8599999999997
naturally

exactly so thanks for that article

3222.839 --> 3227.16
literally making my point

3225.119 --> 3230.059
that oil yeah is technically

3227.16 --> 3230.0589999999997
biodegradable

3231.3 --> 3237.78
although earlier there wasn't oh

3234.119 --> 3240.6600000000003
there's a it can't do that no it can do

3237.78 --> 3242.599
that so first there's somebody a story

3240.66 --> 3245.22
wrote oh it doesn't

3242.599 --> 3247.6800000000003

I don't know man there's not a real lot

3261.72 --> 3266.7599999999998
of specificity I mean this seems to be

3264.54 --> 3270.44
just a bunch of environmentalists

3266.76 --> 3273.9
arguing about the situation I don't

3270.44 --> 3274.8
there's no statistics in here visible or

3273.9 --> 3276.96

looking that up steamy Trevor

3330.9 --> 3333.079
thank you

3336.48 --> 3342.68
right so yeah I guess

3340.38 --> 3345.6600000000003
there's no direct interest from

3342.68 --> 3348.74
environmentalists to to get on that

3345.66 --> 3348.74

3485.0 --> 3490.859
ation that's right now I remember yeah

3487.92 --> 3494.94
we were talking about the desalination

3490.859 --> 3498.38
and then issues with oil that would like

3494.94 --> 3498.38
make it impossible

3498.54 --> 3504.359
so then my question remains are there

3501.119 --> 3507.7400000000002
any desalination plans

3504.359 --> 3507.74
at the Gulf of Mexico

3507.96 --> 3512.059
are they there are they not there

3515.76 --> 3520.559
because if they are there well that's a

3518.579 --> 3523.6800000000003
sign on the wall then

3520.559 --> 3526.6800000000003
I mean that's like okay I guess there

3523.68 --> 3530.24
isn't a lot of toxicity then in order to

destroy those filters

pinpoint out what exactly you're

referencing at all

unless you're in the middle of

3621.96 --> 3627.119
rolling something out and then you say

3624.48 --> 3628.92
separately no then it's connectable you

3627.119 --> 3631.94
haven't done that so what the hell are

3628.92 --> 3631.94

freaking map on that thing damn it oh

see it on a map

3690.24 --> 3693.0789999999997
ah

3695.64 --> 3702.299
so they are desalinating plants in Texas

3698.299 --> 3702.299
cool where

3705.299 --> 3709.04
why don't they have a little map

thanks for the link though

3724.92 --> 3730.099

3727.74 --> 3730.0989999999997

3730.799 --> 3734.37

fascinating

[Music]

3737.52 --> 3744.78

3740.88 --> 3747.839
there any addressing of like the

BP oil spill

that operation

3752.76 --> 3760.8590000000004
been there before that happened or after

3757.38 --> 3763.1400000000003
do they have some kind of a system to

3760.859 --> 3766.319
prevent the

3763.14 --> 3769.16
oil toxins from influencing the main

3766.319 --> 3769.16

3785.099 --> 3788.2400000000002
elaborate website

hey that's an actual map

3829.5 --> 3833.7

oh wait Texas really is only border to

3833.7 --> 3839.66

3840.18 --> 3844.98
that makes sense

my topography concerning the United

3852.059 --> 3856.079
I sometimes think that like Texas is

3854.28 --> 3858.599
just like

3856.079 --> 3861.2400000000002
it's just the southeast of the United

3861.24 --> 3867.5

3863.76 --> 3867.5
may be even another state in between

even after I asked to elaborate

3902.88 --> 3909.9
right and George Sanford says oils at

3907.44 --> 3913.7400000000002
the bottom it doesn't draw the

3909.9 --> 3916.7400000000002
well how about leeching

3913.74 --> 3917.5789999999997
the leeching of the chemicals in the

3916.74 --> 3920.2799999999997

3917.579 --> 3925.02
oil itself

3920.28 --> 3928.6800000000003
leeches you know when you have like oil

3925.02 --> 3932.24
and then or tar and you just like yeah

3928.68 --> 3932.24
it leeches on you

3933.96 --> 3937.76
that may happen with water as well

3943.98 --> 3948.9

3961.319 --> 3967.5589999999997

3964.74 --> 3971.24
talking about yes yeah apparently that

3967.559 --> 3971.2400000000002
isn't true as as the link

3972.0 --> 3978.06
that that you provided proves

3981.839 --> 3988.52

3984.059 --> 3988.52

3992.16 --> 3997.56

4001.23 --> 4008.77

4014.539 --> 4019.2200000000003
it is a mess well the whole point is

4017.299 --> 4020.599
about this discussion that we've been

4019.22 --> 4023.48
having

4020.599 --> 4026.1800000000003
is that if it is such a mess then how

4023.48 --> 4027.7
can there be

4026.18 --> 4031.16
Water

4027.7 --> 4032.96
Reclamation plants

4031.16 --> 4036.74
at the ocean

4032.96 --> 4037.88
that because there is standard issues

4036.74 --> 4042.3799999999997
with

4037.88 --> 4044.48
oil yeah in water

4042.38 --> 4047.359
and even leaching like it doesn't have

4044.48 --> 4050.42
to be Globs of oil drifting in the

4047.359 --> 4053.24
machine like it just leeches in stuff

4050.42 --> 4055.1800000000003
that dissolves in the water that's in

4053.24 --> 4059.4399999999996
oil

4055.18 --> 4059.44
and that kind of like keeps happening

4060.02 --> 4064.819
or maybe it stopped right maybe there's

4062.9 --> 4068.78
no more leaching it's just kind of like

4064.819 --> 4071.0589999999997
a weird tar residue there and like

4068.78 --> 4074.44
all the the toxicity has just gone away

4071.059 --> 4074.44
maybe that's the case

4077.66 --> 4081.859
or maybe they have figured out some

4080.18 --> 4085.72
really interesting

4081.859 --> 4085.72
techniques to get

4086.839 --> 4089.68
the oil

4089.96 --> 4093.38
out of it

4091.52 --> 4097.04
before

4093.38 --> 4099.5
they yeah they use the filters

4097.04 --> 4102.64
so that the filters don't get ruined all

4099.5 --> 4102.64
the time quickly

4118.219 --> 4126.16
the processes only now becoming

4121.299 --> 4126.16
economically active what the okay

4126.319 --> 4128.92
hmm

4151.88 --> 4154.88
okay

4162.56 --> 4168.1990000000005
so they're not really mentioning

4165.799 --> 4171.1
anything about the issues

4168.199 --> 4171.099999999999
that's weird

4175.4 --> 4183.98
there's no there's not that's weird like

4179.06 --> 4186.92
I mean it's the Texas water

4183.98 --> 4189.3189999999995
extraction from Ocean like wouldn't

4186.92 --> 4191.54
there be some kind of mansion like oh

4189.319 --> 4194.06
yeah and there's the the gigantic oil

4191.54 --> 4197.0
spill and this is how we

4194.06 --> 4200.6
can still guarantee save water despite

4197.0 --> 4205.06
that giant disaster having happened like

4200.6 --> 4205.06
there's no mention of it like what

4205.34 --> 4211.16
no nothing

4207.5 --> 4214.12
it's like it doesn't exist

4211.16 --> 4214.12
this is weird

4220.76 --> 4228.1990000000005
I mean if I were a water refining plant

4225.38 --> 4230.3
at the Gulf of Mexico I would have a

4228.199 --> 4234.339999999999
separate page on my website about the

4230.3 --> 4234.34
golf oil spill and how

4234.5 --> 4238.58
the engineers have figured out how to

4236.78 --> 4240.98
deal with it

4238.58 --> 4243.62
I mean that would be like a whole pride

4240.98 --> 4246.44
thing for my company

4243.62 --> 4249.679
if I'd be doing that like why isn't

4246.44 --> 4252.219
there any reference that I could spot

4249.679 --> 4252.219
weird

4275.0 --> 4279.62
or is it just me is there some page in

4278.0 --> 4282.38
there

4279.62 --> 4284.3
that because I can't find it and I have

4282.38 --> 4286.76
a lot of pages by the way but I'm just

4284.3 --> 4289.820000000001
browsing through like the the titles and

4286.76 --> 4291.7390000000005
it's like no reference whatsoever

4289.82 --> 4294.219
should any kind of oil spill or

4291.739 --> 4294.218999999999
pollution

4304.88 --> 4311.14
Texas water conditions report

4308.6 --> 4311.14
hmm

4312.14 --> 4315.34
something I could check

4316.94 --> 4322.5199999999995
most recent conditions in the water 2023

4328.699 --> 4333.879999999999
that's pretty interesting it's just

4330.5 --> 4333.88
available like that

4340.64 --> 4342.820000000001
okay

4346.159 --> 4349.599999999999
this surgeons rainfall

4352.76 --> 4355.76
what

4356.3 --> 4358.900000000001
right

4363.86 --> 4373.639999999999
this is just a bunch of geological data

4369.46 --> 4376.12
rainfall and all that like what

4373.64 --> 4376.12
okay

4376.88 --> 4381.08
I think but is this Texas Water Board

4379.52 --> 4385.580000000001
this is like

4381.08 --> 4389.98
just in general all things water related

4385.58 --> 4389.98
it's not just a desalination plan

4391.58 --> 4395.0199999999995
so is it part of the government

4397.1 --> 4401.54
because we have like a separated

4399.08 --> 4405.08
government like that too here that

4401.54 --> 4407.9
specifically about water situation well

4405.08 --> 4410.42
because it's the Netherlands and we

4407.9 --> 4412.879999999999
definitely need that to like for the

4410.42 --> 4416.08
maintain maintenance of the dikes and

4412.88 --> 4416.08
rivers and everything

4437.199 --> 4440.96
yeah but I mean that's the only logical

4439.88 --> 4444.1990000000005
Richard

4440.96 --> 4446.4800000000005
fish population going down I mean

4444.199 --> 4449.54
it's amazing that there is any fish

4446.48 --> 4451.28
population at all really

4449.54 --> 4453.98
right

4451.28 --> 4457.159
that's the amazing part it's like oh it

4453.98 --> 4459.919999999999
went down 80 oh my God what do you mean

4457.159 --> 4464.98
it's not down a hundred percent what

4459.92 --> 4464.9800000000005
there's fish living in that okay

4477.32 --> 4481.28
that's what you were saying by Dazzle

4479.0 --> 4483.8
yeah well eighty percent

4481.28 --> 4486.92
I mean twenty percent left is not

4483.8 --> 4489.5
exactly desolate it just means that

4486.92 --> 4491.2390000000005
yeah they've taken a bad hit and that's

4489.5 --> 4494.5
logical but I'm really surprised there's

4491.239 --> 4494.5
anything left at all

4496.94 --> 4503.12
it's not just a dead zone and like any

4499.28 --> 4505.04
fish that tries to swim in just dies

4503.12 --> 4507.8
so

4505.04 --> 4510.92
but I guess that

4507.8 --> 4514.06
it's not that bad and if fish can live

4510.92 --> 4518.4800000000005
there then maybe they can

4514.06 --> 4521.3
desalinated too and it would still be

4518.48 --> 4523.04
feasible I don't know that's kind of

4521.3 --> 4525.679
what this whole point of the last half

4523.04 --> 4528.14
hour has been is to figure out what the

4525.679 --> 4531.26
actual condition is and oh my God is

4528.14 --> 4533.780000000001
that difficult to determine

4531.26 --> 4537.320000000001
even with all the data

4533.78 --> 4539.48
it's still not very clear

4537.32 --> 4541.94
but at least yeah I mean fish population

4539.48 --> 4544.879999999999
isn't indicator but I mean oh my God

4541.94 --> 4548.96
it's 80 is gone

4544.88 --> 4551.26
in over 10 years how are there any fish

4548.96 --> 4551.26
left

4551.78 --> 4555.28
so that's actually like

4558.02 --> 4563.0
yeah

4560.3 --> 4565.219
so what is the condition then like what

4563.0 --> 4569.62
is the actual condition then

4565.219 --> 4569.62
if they're still 20 fish population

4570.08 --> 4575.0199999999995
what is the condition what is the actual

4572.719 --> 4575.02
condition

4575.12 --> 4581.84
and

4577.28 --> 4584.36
does it is it said to even influence the

4581.84 --> 4587.96
desalination plans like

4584.36 --> 4590.299999999999
I didn't see any mention of it on that

4587.96 --> 4592.46
entire Texas

4590.3 --> 4595.3
water board

4592.46 --> 4595.3
website

4595.4 --> 4602.0
nothing

4597.739 --> 4604.159
no mention no mention whatsoever

4602.0 --> 4606.44
that's weird to me

4604.159 --> 4609.799999999999
like that wouldn't that be like a

4606.44 --> 4611.78
prominent thing to like justify their

4609.8 --> 4613.820000000001
activities because it's like oh we need

4611.78 --> 4616.94
the Texas water development board to

4613.82 --> 4619.94
take care of the old golf situation

4616.94 --> 4621.98
like wouldn't they have some kind of

4619.94 --> 4623.719
department on that

4621.98 --> 4627.62
just to

4623.719 --> 4631.699
to reassure the public I don't get it

4627.62 --> 4633.8
I don't get it this is so weird to me

4631.699 --> 4636.699
almost makes me wonder like did it even

4633.8 --> 4636.6990000000005
happen at all

4638.26 --> 4643.96
wouldn't it be all over the the website

4666.56 --> 4668.7390000000005
thank you

4671.179 --> 4675.62
right so yeah it's not really getting

4673.88 --> 4677.96
resolved maybe some of you are really

4675.62 --> 4679.88
digging into this knowing much better

4677.96 --> 4681.7390000000005
where to look and all that I'm not good

4679.88 --> 4683.9800000000005
at digging on the internet I really am

4681.739 --> 4683.98
not

4684.26 --> 4687.08
and I really do thank for the links

4686.12 --> 4689.719
though

4687.08 --> 4691.4
it would involved in it did help

4689.719 --> 4693.199
but now I'm just left with another

4691.4 --> 4695.719
mystery it's like why does the Texas

4693.199 --> 4699.678999999999
Water Board development whatever website

4695.719 --> 4702.56
why does it have no reference whatsoever

4699.679 --> 4704.42
do the freaking BP oil spill and how it

4702.56 --> 4707.0
has influenced the operations or

4704.42 --> 4709.719
anything it's like there's nothing there

4707.0 --> 4709.719
like what

4710.78 --> 4716.42
how could it not be there

4714.08 --> 4719.239
isn't that like yeah the desalination

4716.42 --> 4721.76
plans are right on top of that situation

4719.239 --> 4724.218999999999
how could there not be a reference to

4721.76 --> 4727.219
that makes no sense

4724.219 --> 4727.219
ah

4727.79 --> 4730.84
[Music]

4736.38 --> 4741.539
[Music]

4745.04 --> 4749.179
anyway

4746.86 --> 4751.759999999999
somebody's gonna find some kind of

4749.179 --> 4754.2390000000005
answer to that it might just as well

4751.76 --> 4754.2390000000005
move on

4755.13 --> 4759.26
[Music]

4757.1 --> 4760.610000000001
still got a half an hour left for the

4759.26 --> 4763.649
show

4760.61 --> 4763.648999999999
[Music]

4773.739 --> 4777.379999999999
Nathan's thrown out a link so there's

4776.12 --> 4779.239
definitely going to be a flatter of

4777.38 --> 4782.2390000000005
debates

4779.239 --> 4784.699
looking forward to that

4782.239 --> 4788.239
oh I still have to go out to get

4784.699 --> 4788.239
groceries ugh

4790.34 --> 4793.3
thank you

4795.83 --> 4802.8189999999995
[Music]

4803.96 --> 4811.02
let's put the put it in the title

4807.4 --> 4811.0199999999995
[Music]

4815.45 --> 4827.869
[Music]

4833.719 --> 4839.38
I mean why not just get specific about

4837.08 --> 4839.38
it

4839.78 --> 4843.259999999999
it's just randomly specific now

4842.0 --> 4845.659
[Music]

4843.26 --> 4847.88
so yeah the show is now officially the

4845.659 --> 4850.46
text and desalination plans and the BP

4847.88 --> 4853.28
oil spill

4850.46 --> 4856.159
that's basically stumbling on figuring

4853.28 --> 4860.0199999999995
out like why there is no

4856.159 --> 4860.0199999999995
reference to it

4861.679 --> 4869.369
today is a really weird random show

4865.51 --> 4869.369000000001
[Music]

4889.4 --> 4895.54
the water isn't drawn from the surface

4892.94 --> 4895.54
okay

4897.04 --> 4900.679
so

4898.88 --> 4904.04
thank you by the way for that input

4900.679 --> 4905.84
diver Dan net Navy vet does that mean

4904.04 --> 4908.719
that

4905.84 --> 4911.719
they basically just dig a giant hole and

4908.719 --> 4913.699
then let the ocean water go through the

4911.719 --> 4916.12
beach sand and that way they catch all

4913.699 --> 4916.12
that water

4917.6 --> 4924.9800000000005
because that would probably help

4921.679 --> 4927.26
I mean sand is a really good water

4924.98 --> 4930.04
filter if you have enough of it for the

4927.26 --> 4930.04
water to go through

4944.6 --> 4950.14
but also how about the original

4950.42 --> 4956.179
junk the the poison that they sprayed on

4953.42 --> 4959.78
it to make the oil sink and all that

4956.179 --> 4961.64
it it has that like dissolved and

4959.78 --> 4965.0
transformed

4961.64 --> 4967.780000000001
is that or is it still lingering around

4965.0 --> 4967.78
I don't know

4969.8 --> 4974.84
I have no idea how long that chemical

4972.86 --> 4977.299999999999
that they use then

4974.84 --> 4980.06
how long it even lasts or if it just

4977.3 --> 4983.06
like it just reacts and then

4980.06 --> 4984.9800000000005
like it's no longer

4983.06 --> 4985.870000000001
it just turns to something harmless or

4984.98 --> 4988.929999999999
something I don't know

4985.87 --> 4988.93
[Music]

5003.1 --> 5007.56
by playing out in the body of one

5008.26 --> 5012.76
okay

5009.94 --> 5017.339999999999
so they do actually just suck the water

5012.76 --> 5017.34
from the ocean but like under

5017.86 --> 5022.9
what

5019.719 --> 5025.3
and that works

5022.9 --> 5027.94
that actually works

5025.3 --> 5030.46
so they're still like oil shitty stuff

5027.94 --> 5032.32
might be floating or whatever or

5030.46 --> 5034.6
underneath it and they just stick the

5032.32 --> 5037.9
pipe in between sucking the water from

5034.6 --> 5042.1
in between and that works out

5037.9 --> 5044.86
what that seems really bizarre

5042.1 --> 5046.85
but

5044.86 --> 5056.91
I guess if it works it works

5046.85 --> 5056.910000000001
[Music]

5066.159 --> 5071.739
on ships wait what

5069.58 --> 5073.8
you're saying that there actually is

5071.739 --> 5078.879999999999
water collection

5073.8 --> 5081.28
Oceanic water collection on ships

5078.88 --> 5083.88
are you serious

5081.28 --> 5083.88
really

5084.88 --> 5089.38
I mean that seems

5087.82 --> 5091.42
weird

5089.38 --> 5095.7390000000005
yeah we're gonna go out with this ship

5091.42 --> 5098.02
on the ocean to collect water

5095.739 --> 5099.5199999999995
what

5098.02 --> 5101.5
okay

5099.52 --> 5103.84
quickly

5101.5 --> 5107.52
put a hole in the in the boat we need to

5103.84 --> 5107.52
collect this Oceanic water

5108.159 --> 5110.879999999999
laughs

5111.219 --> 5116.52
uh

5113.14 --> 5116.52
that sounds a little weird

5129.159 --> 5136.0599999999995
I mean for real diver damn dude is that

5131.98 --> 5139.139999999999
real boats go out in the ocean to

5136.06 --> 5139.14
collect ocean water

5140.739 --> 5145.95
Is that real

5142.3 --> 5147.34
that that sounds really like an onion

5145.95 --> 5149.82
[Music]

5147.34 --> 5149.82
thing

5150.04 --> 5155.94
but I guess you work with desalination

5153.34 --> 5155.9400000000005
plants

5161.02 --> 5164.679
they all natural breakdown yes I know

5163.36 --> 5166.839999999999
diver Dan

5164.679 --> 5169.4800000000005
I know that we talked about that earlier

5166.84 --> 5172.360000000001
but I just

5169.48 --> 5175.5599999999995
all I was interested in is the actual

5172.36 --> 5175.5599999999995
conditions of the ocean

5178.84 --> 5181.5
and like

5181.78 --> 5188.08
how that matches with the quality water

5185.56 --> 5189.34
intake for the desalination plants I

5188.08 --> 5191.32
just want to know what the actual

5189.34 --> 5194.08
condition is I mean are these

5191.32 --> 5196.299999999999
desalination plants like uber that they

5194.08 --> 5199.12
can basically just

5196.3 --> 5201.360000000001
suck the water out of an actual tar pit

5199.12 --> 5204.94
then it's that

5201.36 --> 5206.799999999999
meticulous or is the ocean water just

5204.94 --> 5209.678999999999
not that bad

5206.8 --> 5212.62
like I I don't know how to size this up

5209.679 --> 5215.56
I mean there is an 80 percent decrease

5212.62 --> 5217.98
in fish population apparently how they

5215.56 --> 5219.06
measure that I don't know

5217.98 --> 5222.28
[Music]

5219.06 --> 5223.6
calculated it probably right

5222.28 --> 5226.679
but

5223.6 --> 5226.679
that's one thing

5227.5 --> 5231.639
right

5229.36 --> 5235.62
and every pack of yacht

5231.639 --> 5235.62
and it has an arrow what

5237.34 --> 5241.38
oh

5238.9 --> 5241.379999999999
okay okay

5241.9 --> 5245.92
yeah but that's different then thanks

5244.36 --> 5247.48
for telling me by the way that's

5245.92 --> 5250.36
interesting so they have their own

5247.48 --> 5252.459999999999
desalination plans basically inside the

5250.36 --> 5254.799999999999
ship big crew that makes sense it's very

5252.46 --> 5257.5
handy

5254.8 --> 5260.08
but yeah when you say when you first

5257.5 --> 5261.82
mentioned they go out to the ocean to

5260.08 --> 5266.44
collect what I was really thinking of

5261.82 --> 5266.44
like a transport vessel

5266.56 --> 5272.5
loaded with a cargo of ocean water to go

5269.86 --> 5275.86
back in land to collect the water that's

5272.5 --> 5279.58
kind of the imagery that came to my mind

5275.86 --> 5281.98
but if it's just like for local water

5279.58 --> 5284.92
reserves in the boat yeah that's a

5281.98 --> 5286.48
different matter it's not good

5284.92 --> 5290.08
scoop up

5286.48 --> 5292.36
the ocean to transport it because that's

5290.08 --> 5295.38
kind of what it sounded like to me when

5292.36 --> 5295.38
you first mentioned that

5298.48 --> 5300.339999999999
right

5299.21 --> 5302.8
[Music]

5300.34 --> 5303.13
but that's pretty cool that ships have

5302.8 --> 5306.959
that

5303.13 --> 5306.959
[Music]

5307.48 --> 5315.4
not so cool when that breaks though

5310.92 --> 5317.92
[Music]

5315.4 --> 5319.54
I mean if you're I mean yeah like what

5317.92 --> 5322.4800000000005
would happen if you're like on a cruise

5319.54 --> 5325.54
ship and suddenly an oil spill disaster

5322.48 --> 5327.82
happens like another freaking platform

5325.54 --> 5329.08
blows up and you're going right through

5327.82 --> 5331.54
it

5329.08 --> 5334.0
and it's like on the deep ocean so it's

5331.54 --> 5335.92
gonna take like days or whatever or more

5334.0 --> 5338.92
to get back and what if then suddenly

5335.92 --> 5341.32
all the water desalination systems get

5338.92 --> 5342.46
all ruined by the raw oil just getting

5341.32 --> 5344.259999999999
in there

5342.46 --> 5346.84
and then you're stuck on a ship without

5344.26 --> 5349.26
water all of a sudden it's gonna run out

5346.84 --> 5349.26
quickly

5356.199 --> 5361.678999999999
distillation wasn't more costly

5359.02 --> 5361.679
yes

5362.44 --> 5368.32
you have to evaporate it

5364.36 --> 5370.36
all of it so

5368.32 --> 5373.259999999999
I mean glad that there's more efficient

5370.36 --> 5373.259999999999
ways to do it now

5384.4 --> 5392.32
because how much does a big ship

5388.42 --> 5394.42
typically has like even in water storage

5392.32 --> 5396.639
do they have a water storage or is it

5394.42 --> 5400.84
really like no they just make the water

5396.639 --> 5403.2390000000005
from the ocean for the next day

5400.84 --> 5404.860000000001
how much

5403.239 --> 5407.799999999999
like

5404.86 --> 5409.54
drinking and utility water do they even

5407.8 --> 5411.6990000000005
store typically

5409.54 --> 5415.0199999999995
in the ship

5411.699 --> 5415.0199999999995
that has those plants

5417.28 --> 5422.0199999999995
are those like devices that just

5419.92 --> 5423.82
continually keep running it's like

5422.02 --> 5424.900000000001
always keep it running always producing

5423.82 --> 5426.82
new water

5424.9 --> 5429.339999999999
or is it just something they turned on

5426.82 --> 5432.099999999999
for a while and then they have an entire

5429.34 --> 5433.12
water supply for months or something I

5432.1 --> 5435.76
don't know

5433.12 --> 5438.179
I'm asking you seem to know some things

5435.76 --> 5441.51
about this diver Dan I appreciate you

5438.179 --> 5457.01
speaking up about it in the chat

5441.51 --> 5457.01
[Music]

5469.96 --> 5478.08
maybe she's a machine shop yeah yeah

5473.679 --> 5478.08
that makes sense very handy

5480.46 --> 5484.84
I mean if something breaks you yeah it's

5482.92 --> 5486.6990000000005
like oh no we need to go back we need to

5484.84 --> 5488.7390000000005
replace this one part no no you're

5486.699 --> 5491.099999999999
probably gonna attempt to make the part

5488.739 --> 5491.099999999999
then

5491.679 --> 5494.159
yeah

5494.62 --> 5508.46
repair it on the spot

5496.03 --> 5508.46
[Music]

5508.739 --> 5514.78
thanks as full as possible and they do

5511.659 --> 5519.638999999999
avoid disaster right okay thanks thanks

5514.78 --> 5522.46
for the very informative update

5519.639 --> 5525.06
now I know

5522.46 --> 5525.06
huh

5527.679 --> 5533.639
I was running until tanks are full right

5530.8 --> 5535.89
so they do have like a decent Supply

5533.639 --> 5550.96
storage for water then

5535.89 --> 5553.0
[Music]

5550.96 --> 5556.85

[Music]

5562.82 --> 5576.0
[Music]

5572.08 --> 5576.0
no they do fill it up from the shore

5576.04 --> 5580.86
okay

5577.18 --> 5583.0
[Music]

5580.86 --> 5586.96
but like

5583.0 --> 5589.54
how much does a ship that's just like a

5586.96 --> 5592.0
I don't know cruise ship or whatever how

5589.54 --> 5595.239
much do they fill up and for how long

5592.0 --> 5598.12
does that last does it last like a month

5595.239 --> 5601.659
fully seated about

5598.12 --> 5606.01
or does it like last a week

5601.659 --> 5629.739
how much do they even store at first

5606.01 --> 5631.9800000000005

we're hearing out a specialist that just

5651.82 --> 5657.759999999999
happened to pop up in my chat as I was

5654.699 --> 5661.54
asking questions about what seems to be

5657.76 --> 5662.8
partially's field of expertise

5661.54 --> 5664.659
because he does seem to have many

5662.8 --> 5666.76
answers

5664.659 --> 5692.138999999999

that's a

5712.54 --> 5720.54
is that like a swimming pool

5715.54 --> 5724.239
filled up or more that's ins whoa

5720.54 --> 5726.91

what is actually a specific one this

5765.4 --> 5767.429999999999
might be about the boat you're talking

5766.84 --> 5770.04

55.8 feet diameter

5774.36 --> 5781.199

5844.57 --> 5848.5
[Music]

5846.52 --> 5849.280000000001
that's not as big as I thought it would

5848.5 --> 5853.32
be

5849.28 --> 5853.32
it's still freaking huge though

5854.26 --> 5860.320000000001
that's a that is like a

5858.82 --> 5862.96
like

5860.32 --> 5866.199
it's not as big as like those insanely

5862.96 --> 5868.9
vast oil tankers

5866.199 --> 5870.638999999999
those they're real those are like

5868.9 --> 5872.199
insanely big

5870.639 --> 5875.84
so it's not as big as that but it is

5872.199 --> 5883.419999999999
like a a decent grain silo or something

5875.84 --> 5885.96
[Music]

5883.42 --> 5885.96
hmm

5904.42 --> 5907.96
don't even get me started about

5906.04 --> 5910.42
submarines

5907.96 --> 5913.179
well I might but I mean the show is like

5910.42 --> 5915.58
almost done so but I mean this is

5913.179 --> 5917.34
interesting dude do come by more I'd

5915.58 --> 5919.96
love to talk about this I love

5917.34 --> 5923.02
engineering like this like I like

5919.96 --> 5924.04
knowing about like what is on a ship how

5923.02 --> 5926.26
much

5924.04 --> 5928.8
how to set pan out like how was it

5926.26 --> 5928.8
designed

5929.92 --> 5933.54
this very interesting to me

5935.5 --> 5940.12
like with these kinds of things the

5937.54 --> 5943.719
utilities like I like to think about

5940.12 --> 5945.5199999999995
that you know why also because well

5943.719 --> 5948.699
it's also very handy if you're gonna

5945.52 --> 5951.040000000001
create a virtual environment like oh a

5948.699 --> 5953.5
castle okay what do you actually need in

5951.04 --> 5956.92
a castle right how is that gonna

5953.5 --> 5957.82
realistically work and be feasible and

5956.92 --> 5960.1
then

5957.82 --> 5961.54
well you have to think of all those

5960.1 --> 5964.0
things

5961.54 --> 5967.84
right for example like in a castle Yeah

5964.0 --> 5970.6
where do people go to the toilet right

5967.84 --> 5972.88
typical Gamers don't really like to

5970.6 --> 5975.9400000000005
think about that but I just take

5972.88 --> 5977.86
architecture like that serious as in

5975.94 --> 5980.0199999999995
what the functionality what are you

5977.86 --> 5984.099999999999
doing what is a human being like what is

5980.02 --> 5986.4400000000005
it actually gonna need to be able to do

5984.1 --> 5989.5
over time

5986.44 --> 5991.659
so I like these kinds of conversations

5989.5 --> 5993.58
it's just I'm personally interested in

5991.659 --> 5996.42
that sort of thing

5993.58 --> 5996.42
thank you for that

6001.5 --> 6010.779
foreign

6003.03 --> 6010.7789999999995
[Music]

6016.32 --> 6021.36
yeah I mean Oz

6019.02 --> 6025.92
it's not going to be super cheap but

6021.36 --> 6029.48
it's gonna be not as expensive as

6025.92 --> 6029.4800000000005
chamber pot bucket

6030.719 --> 6033.32
yes

6033.54 --> 6040.0199999999995
I get it skeptic thanks for that

6037.679 --> 6042.56
you're gonna have to send me a PayPal

6040.02 --> 6046.320000000001
and to pay your gate away now

6042.56 --> 6048.2390000000005
no no just kidding yep although I could

6046.32 --> 6050.219
use a Super Chat

6048.239 --> 6052.5599999999995
but uh

6050.219 --> 6054.9
it's just things

6052.56 --> 6057.719
like chamber pots and all that that's

6054.9 --> 6059.9
cute but I mean if something is going to

6057.719 --> 6059.9
be

6061.26 --> 6065.659000000001
I don't know it was just an example

6066.9 --> 6070.82
soon bro okay no problem

6075.3 --> 6079.5
I just like to think about those things

6077.46 --> 6083.76
like a castle what does it need to do

6079.5 --> 6087.3
like how people what do they do in there

6083.76 --> 6089.280000000001
right and it gets a bit weirder also

6087.3 --> 6091.679
because well I typically do it in the

6089.28 --> 6095.04
Dungeons and Dragons Universe with magic

6091.679 --> 6098.9400000000005
and [ __ ] so magic is basically another

6095.04 --> 6101.82
form of industrial capacity you see

6098.94 --> 6103.98
and it really warps physical reality

6101.82 --> 6105.86
like that like how things function

6103.98 --> 6108.839999999999
because of the freaking magic

6105.86 --> 6110.339999999999
possibility it's not that hard to even

6108.84 --> 6115.02
do that

6110.34 --> 6117.360000000001
so it's like a warped world of where

6115.02 --> 6119.6990000000005
certain things can happen that just

6117.36 --> 6121.739
don't happen in reality where the actual

6119.699 --> 6123.659
real engineers

6121.739 --> 6126.718999999999
just have to

6123.659 --> 6128.099999999999
figure out how to make it work

6126.719 --> 6130.58
s

6128.1 --> 6130.58
so

6131.1 --> 6135.6
it's sometimes a bit of a challenge like

6133.08 --> 6138.36
oh how realistic is it based on the real

6135.6 --> 6141.2390000000005
world that that it gives the impression

6138.36 --> 6144.739
of being real to the person experiencing

6141.239 --> 6146.54
it with their character versus

6144.739 --> 6149.879999999999
how

6146.54 --> 6153.06
actually adapted to how that world

6149.88 --> 6155.6990000000005
really works the DND world how much

6153.06 --> 6159.179
adapted to that is it because if some if

6155.699 --> 6162.299999999999
it's over magic over adapted then like

6159.179 --> 6165.0
people you lose interest

6162.3 --> 6170.04
if it's too magical

6165.0 --> 6173.58
too flashy and too like away from some

6170.04 --> 6176.1
kind of physical necessity like in the

6173.58 --> 6179.88
real world then it's not really that

6176.1 --> 6182.6990000000005
interesting too high magic it is kind of

6179.88 --> 6183.78
boring actually in in gaming that's what

6182.699 --> 6187.98
I found out

6183.78 --> 6191.099999999999
I find it boring if it's not realistic

6187.98 --> 6193.32
enough as in realistic based on the

6191.1 --> 6195.4800000000005
world realistic

6193.32 --> 6197.88
and that's very difficult because I mean

6195.48 --> 6201.659
Dungeons and Dragons is a very

6197.88 --> 6204.6900000000005
High magic system in ways

6201.659 --> 6207.7699999999995
that it's always been challenging to me

6204.69 --> 6207.7699999999995
[Music]

6208.199 --> 6214.379999999999
anyway I don't know if you guys care

6211.639 --> 6215.400000000001
but I'm talking about this and this is a

6214.38 --> 6216.43
weird show

6215.4 --> 6218.879999999999
today

6216.43 --> 6221.04
[Music]

6218.88 --> 6224.76
and so this is what we're talking about

6221.04 --> 6227.4
right but I am rounding out though

6224.76 --> 6230.76
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6227.4 --> 6232.379999999999
like this show was a bit weird but I

6230.76 --> 6234.2390000000005
mean it was still interesting I thought

6232.38 --> 6236.1
it was interesting at least I learned a

6234.239 --> 6239.4
couple of things about desalination

6236.1 --> 6241.26
plans and the conditions in the Gulf

6239.4 --> 6243.36
and then apparently they still just pump

6241.26 --> 6246.719
water out of the ocean and desalinated

6243.36 --> 6248.42
despite the the oil spill disaster a

6246.719 --> 6253.199
decade ago

6248.42 --> 6254.52
and yeah a bit surprising right

6253.199 --> 6256.799999999999
but

6254.52 --> 6259.5
is what it is

6256.8 --> 6263.28
I'd love to know a little more about it

6259.5 --> 6265.679
but it didn't really get to that so

6263.28 --> 6267.599999999999
anyway I hope you like this show if you

6265.679 --> 6269.36
