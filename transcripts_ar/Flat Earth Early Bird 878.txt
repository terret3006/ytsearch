as you can already see by my attire

101.439 --> 105.119
the weather is very different today

105.28 --> 113.04
it's a big gray soup out there

109.92 --> 116.0
and it's rainy dreary it's not really

113.04 --> 116.0
raining hard it's just

116.56 --> 123.28
very moist a bit of

120.799 --> 128.72
dripping rain here and there so yeah

123.28 --> 130.399
it's kind of cold and moist

128.72 --> 132.16
good for the plants though and i think

130.399 --> 135.36
it'll probably clear

132.16 --> 135.35999999999999
up the skies

136.56 --> 140.319
clean it up all that moist

140.84 --> 147.28
so it's

143.44 --> 152.07999999999998
choose no tuesday it's thursday

147.28 --> 152.08
the 29th of april 2021

152.16 --> 157.84
hello random first in chat good to see

155.28 --> 157.84
you

168.08 --> 171.84
all right

179.519 --> 185.42000000000002
i completely didn't make any notes

181.28 --> 188.239
yesterday silly of me

185.42 --> 192.95899999999997
[Music]

188.239 --> 192.959
but yeah i've had a bit of like

193.28 --> 196.959
my jaw issue like on the other side this

196.48 --> 200.23899999999998
time

196.959 --> 203.84
because i typically had jaw issues a lot

200.239 --> 207.519
over the years right there

203.84 --> 207.519
but now it's over here

210.0 --> 216.08
and yeah that's it is really distracting

214.08 --> 218.08
you know especially when i start to

216.08 --> 220.15900000000002
worry like oh i need to go to the

218.08 --> 222.0
dentist or something even though

220.159 --> 224.239
even though like this sort of thing has

222.0 --> 227.28
happened so many times

224.239 --> 229.84
and i even like recognize what's going

227.28 --> 229.84
on in there

231.68 --> 234.4
it's just that

236.799 --> 243.68
pain and tensions in places like it does

240.0 --> 246.08
kind of like give this panicky

243.68 --> 246.799
effect sometimes but i got it under

246.08 --> 249.20000000000002
control and

246.799 --> 250.56
i survived it i've survived it many

249.2 --> 252.48
times

250.56 --> 256.16
and it's already feeling better but yeah

252.48 --> 259.59999999999997
it was it was nagging on me yesterday

256.16 --> 262.47900000000004
most of the day maybe also

259.6 --> 263.12
has to do something with weather you

262.479 --> 268.15999999999997
know

263.12 --> 269.68
weather changes and now it's like this

268.16 --> 271.199
wouldn't be surprised if it had an

269.68 --> 274.24
influence but

271.199 --> 274.24
yeah anyway

275.28 --> 282.23999999999995
flat earth early bird yesterday it was

278.639 --> 284.88
interesting to me

282.24 --> 286.479
i didn't watch it back but just yeah

284.88 --> 288.71999999999997
i've been really liking the chat

286.479 --> 292.08
recently it's

288.72 --> 292.08000000000004
been filled up and

293.28 --> 299.52
it yeah it's funny that i

296.56 --> 300.96
i tend to like dwell on my shortcomings

299.52 --> 304.4
right when i feel

300.96 --> 305.039
less than perfect what is perfect if i

304.4 --> 307.919
don't feel

305.039 --> 309.28
super great but still like things like

307.919 --> 312.15999999999997
the chat

309.28 --> 314.55999999999995
and just me interacting with it

312.16 --> 317.03900000000004
especially yesterday and the day before

314.56 --> 319.28000000000003
and even the days before with trolls

317.039 --> 322.08
with ballers with

319.28 --> 322.08
flat earthers

323.44 --> 329.44
it just made me realize like yes i kind

326.8 --> 332.08
of succeeded

329.44 --> 333.44
right whatever i feel about myself and

332.08 --> 336.56
what i've done

333.44 --> 339.12
my fist rule of whatever you do

336.56 --> 341.68
whatever you do whether it is like you

339.12 --> 344.24
feel it shitty or

341.68 --> 345.6
whatever you do always figure out the

344.24 --> 347.84000000000003
way to learn from it

345.6 --> 350.0
like every single time even if it's just

347.84 --> 354.23999999999995
something small

350.0 --> 357.039
right and yeah then i figure out wait

354.24 --> 358.16
my situation with the chat that's a

357.039 --> 361.919
success

358.16 --> 362.639
i accomplished to basically set out a

361.919 --> 365.44
standard

362.639 --> 366.24
and have certain rules and move around

365.44 --> 368.4
with it

366.24 --> 369.28000000000003
feel the dynamics of what's out there

368.4 --> 372.15999999999997
and what people

369.28 --> 373.919
are like in chats like the group

372.16 --> 376.47900000000004
dynamics of it and i think that i

373.919 --> 376.479
succeeded

377.6 --> 381.759
like these this chat is one of the few

380.4 --> 386.71999999999997
chats

381.759 --> 388.88
where where globers and flat earthers

386.72 --> 391.12
can both be welcome dependent on their

388.88 --> 391.84
behavior and flat earthers too because

391.12 --> 394.72
if they

391.84 --> 397.11999999999995
get too aggressive i'll address them on

394.72 --> 399.36
it as well

397.12 --> 400.96
and this is one of the few places where

399.36 --> 405.039
there's a real dynamic

400.96 --> 409.75899999999996
happening despite the very polarizing

405.039 --> 412.88
position of cosmology

409.759 --> 414.56
and it's just good good to realize that

412.88 --> 418.08
like hey i got something

414.56 --> 418.08
i got something going and

418.16 --> 424.24
it makes it worth it

421.44 --> 425.52
right some like metaphorical

424.24 --> 429.12
metaphorically

425.52 --> 431.599
feels sometimes like i'm a spiritual

429.12 --> 432.479
farmer or something but i'm not doing

431.599 --> 435.599
all that great

432.479 --> 438.96
right as a farmer but still

435.599 --> 441.84
because i am doing it

438.96 --> 442.56
and i'm also trying to learn from well

441.84 --> 444.15999999999997
what

442.56 --> 446.8
metaphorically would be considered

444.16 --> 448.639
disasters not super successful

446.8 --> 450.639
there's still like a couple of things

448.639 --> 452.639
that are successful and i've spent

450.639 --> 454.72
extra attention on that and there's

452.639 --> 458.319
still something growing

454.72 --> 461.03900000000004
something that will be good

458.319 --> 461.91900000000004
and there's just people growing i'm

461.039 --> 464.8
noticing that

461.919 --> 466.24
i also provide a platform where people

464.8 --> 470.56
can really come

466.24 --> 472.639
if they're actually interested

470.56 --> 473.599
in like spiritual and consciousness

472.639 --> 476.8
self-growth

473.599 --> 477.36
and also learning their responsibilities

476.8 --> 482.40000000000003
about it

477.36 --> 485.91900000000004
especially that so yeah

482.4 --> 485.919
just wanted to put that out there

489.36 --> 492.96000000000004
i'm really happy with the chat and i'm

491.039 --> 497.34999999999997
happy with that there's just

492.96 --> 498.63899999999995
plenty of people around here

497.35 --> 503.03900000000004
[Music]

498.639 --> 504.0
that are growing like despite this crazy

503.039 --> 507.039
world that's

504.0 --> 511.36
getting crazier by the day

507.039 --> 512.7189999999999
sometimes hello by the way nathan r in

511.36 --> 515.6800000000001
chat chaminator

512.719 --> 516.9590000000001
seeking star water cameron kamikaze

515.68 --> 521.8389999999999
gilmore

516.959 --> 521.8389999999999
yeah good to see you

529.2 --> 536.6400000000001
yes your chat begins my day at 5 00 am

533.279 --> 536.64
wow that's so early

541.519 --> 549.839
hello slow mo slow-mo moon buggy

555.36 --> 565.92
all right

562.32 --> 568.48
right and in a way also right a chat

565.92 --> 571.76
room and a daily show

568.48 --> 573.36
it is kind of in a way a virtual traffic

571.76 --> 576.64
stop

573.36 --> 579.04
sort of and it's just good to see

576.64 --> 581.4399999999999
a lot of people basically cruising

579.04 --> 581.4399999999999
around

581.6 --> 588.72
and stopping here and with it

585.2 --> 591.36
my ability to kind of like

588.72 --> 592.8000000000001
test the waters like what is out there

591.36 --> 597.76
what is coming past here

592.8 --> 597.76
and what would we conclude because of it

598.56 --> 602.8389999999999
and yeah i think there's just the

601.519 --> 606.32
overall

602.839 --> 609.36
quality of inquiry

606.32 --> 610.8000000000001
of people on this voyage is getting

609.36 --> 613.839
better

610.8 --> 619.04
and that really stands out to me like

613.839 --> 621.2790000000001
the people that are sort of newcomers

619.04 --> 622.64
have a higher level they just have a

621.279 --> 625.2
better

622.64 --> 628.88
structural grip on what they've been

625.2 --> 628.88
presented with over the times

628.959 --> 632.4799999999999
and even people that have hung around

631.2 --> 635.76
much longer

632.48 --> 638.5600000000001
they too just

635.76 --> 639.4399999999999
show signs that they're not like being

638.56 --> 642.88
obstructed

639.44 --> 643.9200000000001
by obstacles and their egos holding them

642.88 --> 648.32
back a lot and

643.92 --> 653.4399999999999
hey some some people have

648.32 --> 653.44
but it's really a minority like

653.519 --> 657.44
they don't yeah they stand out when it

655.76 --> 659.279
happens but overall it's just

657.44 --> 661.519
a lot of people that have been doing

659.279 --> 663.519
great

661.519 --> 665.92
those that have been on it for a long

663.519 --> 671.6
time have grown

665.92 --> 674.4799999999999
plenty in it and the newer newcomers

671.6 --> 675.839
they already like seemed to have a

674.48 --> 680.8000000000001
better grip

675.839 --> 683.12
as the newcomers like say four years ago

680.8 --> 685.5999999999999
right oh and yeah this is just like a

683.12 --> 688.72
realization that

685.6 --> 691.2
it's very comforting it's like okay okay

688.72 --> 693.6
right despite whatever impressions are

691.2 --> 693.6
out there

694.8 --> 701.92
it's still going and it's going well

698.64 --> 702.959
it really is going well guys and it's

701.92 --> 705.8389999999999
funny how that

702.959 --> 706.64
also kind of that idea that sentiment is

705.839 --> 708.48
echoing on

706.64 --> 710.24
a lot of platforms i think a lot of

708.48 --> 712.88
people are realizing it

710.24 --> 714.639
like yeah the awakening is going really

712.88 --> 717.6
well

714.639 --> 718.24
and maybe we've all been so used to kind

717.6 --> 720.399
of like

718.24 --> 721.92
the doom hanging over us with all their

720.399 --> 724.079
flaunting and their power and their

721.92 --> 726.4799999999999
insanity

724.079 --> 728.8389999999999
that's almost like we don't even expect

726.48 --> 733.04
really to win anymore

728.839 --> 736.0
because yeah it's been so dark

733.04 --> 738.079
in ways for so long but we are growing

736.0 --> 740.88
out of this shadow

738.079 --> 742.3199999999999
and it's a steady growth and it doesn't

740.88 --> 746.32
seem like the darkness is

742.32 --> 750.24
really able to

746.32 --> 750.24
even slow it down anymore right

751.2 --> 757.0400000000001
the slowing down phases by events and

754.32 --> 760.5600000000001
influences and manipulations they don't

757.04 --> 762.639
last as long anymore it's like we're all

760.56 --> 764.2399999999999
within this growth process like a plant

762.639 --> 768.0
getting used to like the

764.24 --> 768.0
the weird conditions

769.12 --> 774.5600000000001
yes starting to not let it obstruct us

772.88 --> 777.92
as much

774.56 --> 780.16
we're getting used to the insanity yet

777.92 --> 781.1999999999999
keeping it out as much as possible and

780.16 --> 784.8389999999999
that's like

781.2 --> 789.9200000000001
yeah it's like a constant detox

784.839 --> 789.9200000000001
process that you have to keep going

790.32 --> 794.88
as you strive for purity against the

792.56 --> 796.8
darkness

794.88 --> 801.279
and we're all getting better at it it's

796.8 --> 803.8389999999999
like it's not chewing us down it's

801.279 --> 803.8389999999999
it's not

804.48 --> 808.5600000000001
like chewing at our foundations

808.72 --> 811.839
doesn't do that anymore

813.44 --> 821.2790000000001
it's good anyway yeah

817.68 --> 821.8389999999999
flat earth debate it's also decent but i

821.279 --> 824.72
was

821.839 --> 826.72
yeah right after the show my show ended

824.72 --> 829.44
i really kind of got hit by

826.72 --> 831.12
jaw aches and [ __ ] so wasn't super

829.44 --> 832.639
active

831.12 --> 834.88
spoke up a couple of times here and

832.639 --> 834.88
there

834.959 --> 838.56
it was again more about the whole ranty

837.76 --> 842.48
thing in the

838.56 --> 845.5999999999999
picture like nathan's really on to this

842.48 --> 848.9590000000001
he's like set up camp like

845.6 --> 850.8000000000001
right in that picture because he sees

848.959 --> 853.04
like yeah this is where now a lot of

850.8 --> 855.04
action and attention is at

853.04 --> 856.079
he knows exactly what to do with it

855.04 --> 860.48
we've already pretty

856.079 --> 862.56
or we them mostly the guys the analytics

860.48 --> 864.24
the analytics crew they're all very good

862.56 --> 865.8389999999999
at it

864.24 --> 867.92
i've already pretty much figured out

865.839 --> 871.839
exactly what's happened

867.92 --> 873.92
psychological and strategical

871.839 --> 875.7600000000001
so there's really yeah it's a black swan

873.92 --> 878.7199999999999
it's a really good black swan

875.76 --> 878.72
blackpool's one

879.44 --> 883.0400000000001
and there's really nothing bothers can

881.04 --> 886.8
do about it but just try to

883.04 --> 889.199
conjure this this double think

886.8 --> 890.7199999999999
dream that this is supposed to be a

889.199 --> 892.959
proof and they're going with that

890.72 --> 895.6
that that's their level now that's what

892.959 --> 900.399
they do that's what the ballers do now

895.6 --> 900.399
it's sheer delusional desperation

903.199 --> 906.639
so that's what they're dealing with it's

905.12 --> 907.12
probably going to last for a while until

906.639 --> 910.8
something

907.12 --> 912.16
new happens also weirdest ranty

910.8 --> 914.8
apparently has

912.16 --> 916.24
sent out a video like oh yeah i

914.8 --> 919.92
challenge you to a debate

916.24 --> 922.48
and then some of our guys responded to

919.92 --> 927.279
that and then he retracted it

922.48 --> 930.48
it's like what come on

927.279 --> 931.519
so as i said before it to me it seems

930.48 --> 935.36
like

931.519 --> 935.36
ranty is not doing very well

937.279 --> 943.199
how did your last event go what

940.72 --> 943.1990000000001
event

943.38 --> 946.49
[Music]

951.839 --> 955.839
hello george sanford by the way

959.44 --> 963.2790000000001
ah so you can start yeah you are a real

962.56 --> 968.7199999999999
early

963.279 --> 970.56
early girl early bird awesome

968.72 --> 972.72
well then this show is probably good for

970.56 --> 972.7199999999999
you

973.6 --> 978.0
you know i personally i'm kind of a

978.639 --> 983.279
i tend to be a late bird but i have had

981.519 --> 984.399
plenty of moments throughout my life

983.279 --> 986.959
where i got to

984.399 --> 988.88
kind of like really swing around and

986.959 --> 990.959
then i had a couple of periods of

988.88 --> 992.88
very early time and i've always noticed

990.959 --> 994.2399999999999
that in those times in those really

992.88 --> 996.959
early hours

994.24 --> 998.8
people are really still and clear-minded

996.959 --> 1000.7199999999999
a lot of them

998.8 --> 1002.3199999999999
when the rest of the day they get all

1000.72 --> 1004.399
caught up in whatever they're supposed

1002.32 --> 1008.1600000000001
to be doing or doing

1004.399 --> 1012.32
mentally so

1008.16 --> 1012.3199999999999
for that i hope to be

1013.519 --> 1019.68
well performing

1016.8 --> 1022.8389999999999
i hope to be giving output that is kind

1019.68 --> 1027.28
of adapted to that clear still

1022.839 --> 1029.52
minded way of perceiving things

1027.28 --> 1030.48
until go rage win or something right i

1029.52 --> 1033.199
know that's

1030.48 --> 1037.1200000000001
the moment when those people probably

1033.199 --> 1037.1200000000001
kind of step away and i totally get that

1037.52 --> 1041.839
you probably should if it's going to

1039.52 --> 1045.52
otherwise disrupt your mindset and i'm

1041.839 --> 1045.52
sorry if that's happened before

1049.039 --> 1054.08
right yeah liverpool fc fan i'm not

1052.4 --> 1055.44
much into football i have no idea what

1054.08 --> 1057.84
you're talking about

1055.44 --> 1057.8400000000001
anyway

1059.36 --> 1062.799
double shot latin and

1063.36 --> 1067.84
i just got green tea

1070.49 --> 1073.609
[Music]

1076.88 --> 1083.7600000000002
anyway i took

1080.0 --> 1086.32
a glance also at infowars

1083.76 --> 1087.12
just to kind of like see what's going on

1086.32 --> 1090.96
out there

1087.12 --> 1095.84
any interesting or noteworthy people and

1090.96 --> 1095.8400000000001
it's weird uh

1101.84 --> 1109.84
our winds jumper that's not my channel

1116.24 --> 1121.84
my only channels on youtube that are

1118.72 --> 1126.72
actually under my control

1121.84 --> 1128.8799999999999
our win channel and our win

1126.72 --> 1132.72
are winnie and bear those are my

1128.88 --> 1132.72
channels the rest is all just trolls

1135.36 --> 1139.4399999999998
like i i can't even keep track of the

1137.679 --> 1143.44
trolls anymore

1139.44 --> 1145.76
right and i've

1143.44 --> 1147.6000000000001
took a look out there with concerning

1145.76 --> 1150.32
trolls and i've had quite a lot because

1147.6 --> 1154.1599999999999
i've also had quite a few silly moments

1150.32 --> 1157.2
silly or moments where i was just like

1154.16 --> 1160.64
very emotional one would yeah

1157.2 --> 1160.96
you remember and the trolls like to make

1160.64 --> 1163.5200000000002
er

1160.96 --> 1165.2
make it all about that and yeah i get it

1163.52 --> 1168.4
they have no life and then

1165.2 --> 1169.1200000000001
somebody shows a bit of life then

1168.4 --> 1172.64
they're all

1169.12 --> 1174.8799999999999
obsessed with that they think it might

1172.64 --> 1176.8400000000001
deter me right something that i've done

1174.88 --> 1179.8400000000001
on my channel

1176.84 --> 1182.0
openly that somehow that is something

1179.84 --> 1184.559
they can hold against me

1182.0 --> 1185.679
even though it's all just honest

1184.559 --> 1187.84
expressions and i

1185.679 --> 1189.679
explain everything right every time

1187.84 --> 1192.72
something happens i always

1189.679 --> 1193.76
explain it if i feel it's necessary if i

1192.72 --> 1197.44
or if i get

1193.76 --> 1202.0
genuine questions or concerns

1197.44 --> 1202.0
from people that actually care about

1205.12 --> 1212.0
all right ralph rodriguez

1208.159 --> 1212.0
just saying hello okay

1212.159 --> 1215.6000000000001
going to get some sleep had a late night

1214.64 --> 1221.8400000000001
all right

1215.6 --> 1221.84
have a good rest

1230.559 --> 1235.84
right anyway

1236.559 --> 1240.8799999999999
like over at infowars like weird

1238.48 --> 1243.44
situation with nick fuente who's been

1240.88 --> 1243.44
kind of like

1244.799 --> 1249.36
been made unable to fly or something

1247.28 --> 1250.8799999999999
right oh he's a bit of a bigger channel

1249.36 --> 1253.76
and so

1250.88 --> 1255.7600000000002
getting a lot of attention he's doing

1253.76 --> 1258.64
like a personal protest

1255.76 --> 1260.799
thing or something i don't know i don't

1258.64 --> 1261.2
care really that much it's just that hey

1260.799 --> 1263.84
that's

1261.2 --> 1265.679
i see him on there listen for a few

1263.84 --> 1267.039
minutes and it's like oh all right all

1265.679 --> 1271.039
right

1267.039 --> 1273.039
uh right but yeah then

1271.039 --> 1274.799
owen benjamin went live again with tea

1273.039 --> 1278.32
time gary terry and that

1274.799 --> 1278.32
certainly takes precedence

1278.48 --> 1282.48
it's much more informative and

1280.08 --> 1291.84
entertaining

1282.48 --> 1291.84
and yesterday too was pretty amusing

1294.88 --> 1298.3200000000002
but i didn't make any notes so i don't

1297.12 --> 1300.559
exactly remember

1298.32 --> 1305.84
what it was all about again i think

1300.559 --> 1305.84
there was like a mention of

1307.919 --> 1314.88
right yeah joe rogan

1311.28 --> 1318.32
was brought up again by owen

1314.88 --> 1320.4
i always been kind of bombing with his

1318.32 --> 1325.039
comedic attempts

1320.4 --> 1325.039
and that was like really yeah totally on

1329.36 --> 1333.84
[Music]

1330.84 --> 1333.84
target

1341.36 --> 1348.0
right so that's pretty much it

1346.08 --> 1350.24
um yeah most of yeah i also did my

1348.0 --> 1353.039
newspaper round

1350.24 --> 1356.4
had another weird come from this is

1353.039 --> 1358.8799999999999
typical springtime stuff right

1356.4 --> 1361.919
so that yesterday the entire day i was

1358.88 --> 1365.44
just kind of weird and out of it like

1361.919 --> 1368.4
my spirit mechanisms

1365.44 --> 1372.3200000000002
that i just normally use to basically

1368.4 --> 1372.3200000000002
represent and shield myself

1373.039 --> 1377.52
like it it was off so i had like an off

1375.679 --> 1379.76
day where i just wasn't feeling very

1377.52 --> 1380.24
good like i had this sense of shame over

1379.76 --> 1383.84
me

1380.24 --> 1386.24
very annoying right especially when you

1383.84 --> 1388.8799999999999
know what that does and

1386.24 --> 1389.84
and there was just yeah couldn't do much

1388.88 --> 1393.7600000000002
about it

1389.84 --> 1395.6789999999999
it's just an off day and like yeah those

1393.76 --> 1398.1589999999999
off days if you let those get to you

1395.679 --> 1398.96
then you totally spiral into depression

1398.159 --> 1400.96
that's like

1398.96 --> 1402.72
a danger but i was very aware of it but

1400.96 --> 1406.48
it was just very telling again

1402.72 --> 1408.96
to see people's other people's responses

1406.48 --> 1408.96
to that

1409.6 --> 1412.9599999999998
and then funnily enough me and my

1412.0 --> 1416.159
learning moment

1412.96 --> 1418.32
realizing like how they respond

1416.159 --> 1420.7990000000002
and not letting it get to me but

1418.32 --> 1421.52
actually kind of stepping outside and

1420.799 --> 1423.279
just

1421.52 --> 1425.2
getting in their skin and then realize

1423.279 --> 1426.48
okay this is how they see it this is

1425.2 --> 1429.3600000000001
what is

1426.48 --> 1431.039
making them do that this is probably how

1429.36 --> 1433.6789999999999
they will be

1431.039 --> 1435.679
separately afterward like how are they

1433.679 --> 1438.96
probably going through their own swings

1435.679 --> 1438.96
it is spring after all

1441.2 --> 1446.159
right this is all very meta talk by the

1442.96 --> 1446.159
way i'm not gonna

1447.039 --> 1450.32
because like the first time that was

1449.039 --> 1453.279
during groceries

1450.32 --> 1453.279
there was just this

1456.159 --> 1463.44
like this weird couple well not

1459.76 --> 1466.72
weird they were just a couple probably

1463.44 --> 1467.279
a guy on a scooter and a girl on the

1466.72 --> 1470.96
back

1467.279 --> 1474.08
but they were clearly just like

1470.96 --> 1474.799
i don't know probably into like overly

1474.08 --> 1477.9189999999999
sex

1474.799 --> 1480.1589999999999
relationship or something and just there

1477.919 --> 1481.039
was not a good atmosphere on them on

1480.159 --> 1483.44
them both

1481.039 --> 1486.33
and also it stood out to me like yeah

1483.44 --> 1489.98
these have been at it for a while

1486.33 --> 1489.98
[Music]

1490.24 --> 1493.76
with a lot of issues probably and a lot

1492.559 --> 1496.48
of rejection

1493.76 --> 1498.1589999999999
of probably christianity and everything

1496.48 --> 1500.799
outside

1498.159 --> 1501.3600000000001
not very social and just from seeing

1500.799 --> 1504.32
that

1501.36 --> 1506.0
right is just seeing them they didn't

1504.32 --> 1509.6789999999999
even talk

1506.0 --> 1511.279
and then later yesterday i just do my

1509.679 --> 1514.88
newspaper rounds and they were

1511.279 --> 1515.279
just these girls i think like between 16

1514.88 --> 1518.5590000000002
and

1515.279 --> 1520.88
18 or something and they were like

1518.559 --> 1522.6399999999999
getting ready to go to i think what is

1520.88 --> 1523.6000000000001
it like volleyball or hockey or

1522.64 --> 1526.96
something

1523.6 --> 1530.3999999999999
and they were pretty damn pretty but

1526.96 --> 1532.64
they were like drowning in it drowning

1530.4 --> 1533.279
in the shine that they was coming out of

1532.64 --> 1535.679
them

1533.279 --> 1536.72
as a lot of those girls typically do and

1535.679 --> 1540.24
i was like

1536.72 --> 1542.32
physically intimidated by it

1540.24 --> 1544.799
because i yeah i was feeling weak i

1542.32 --> 1547.84
didn't have like a standard

1544.799 --> 1549.279
attitude ready to present and be like

1547.84 --> 1551.039
hey

1549.279 --> 1553.52
have fun with sports or something no i

1551.039 --> 1555.84
was like really like oh

1553.52 --> 1556.559
i have to get away it's right it's too

1555.84 --> 1558.3999999999999
bright

1556.559 --> 1561.279
and they definitely picked up on that

1558.4 --> 1564.72
and we're like oh that's so tragic

1561.279 --> 1566.0
kind of making fun of it so that's

1564.72 --> 1568.64
another

1566.0 --> 1569.279
impression from the other side and i've

1568.64 --> 1571.2
all ran

1569.279 --> 1573.12
into these kinds of people and even like

1571.2 --> 1576.88
dealt with them

1573.12 --> 1578.559
way back and then everything that would

1576.88 --> 1581.679
come out of them

1578.559 --> 1583.6789999999999
i would literally just replace my own

1581.679 --> 1586.5590000000002
essence with that i would make

1583.679 --> 1586.5590000000002
their response

1588.96 --> 1595.44
central secretly in myself

1592.159 --> 1596.3200000000002
and let it ruin my life also let it make

1595.44 --> 1599.76
me

1596.32 --> 1602.08
let it give me complications and now

1599.76 --> 1603.12
both times yeah the impression was great

1602.08 --> 1605.36
especially

1603.12 --> 1608.32
tying back in like oh [ __ ] i actually

1605.36 --> 1612.799
used to be interested in

1608.32 --> 1616.48
dealing with those types of people

1612.799 --> 1618.8799999999999
but now i know who i am i know how i

1616.48 --> 1620.64
work i know why people respond the way

1618.88 --> 1624.5590000000002
they do

1620.64 --> 1627.8400000000001
and it didn't get to me really it get

1624.559 --> 1630.8799999999999
got to me in the moment but

1627.84 --> 1634.24
afterward i wasn't like just

1630.88 --> 1634.72
i failed everybody hates me or something

1634.24 --> 1641.36
no

1634.72 --> 1644.3990000000001
no i recovered

1641.36 --> 1647.12
and just like oh thank god

1644.399 --> 1648.559
thank god i've improved with that as

1647.12 --> 1652.799
well

1648.559 --> 1654.52
right so yeah a bit of an introspective

1652.799 --> 1657.569
little thing

1654.52 --> 1657.569
[Music]

1662.96 --> 1669.8400000000001
horse jumping over hurdles what

1671.039 --> 1673.44
the hell

1675.919 --> 1679.919
right yeah ventilator sitting in the

1677.919 --> 1681.1200000000001
garbage dump yesterday yeah i heard of

1679.919 --> 1685.279
that

1681.12 --> 1687.6
oh your aunt was killed by that terrible

1685.279 --> 1687.6
damn

1689.76 --> 1695.44
but yes there seems to be all kinds of

1693.039 --> 1698.799
rejections

1695.44 --> 1702.64
from covic policy related

1698.799 --> 1706.0
things all over the world

1702.64 --> 1709.44
it's really getting ahead it seems like

1706.0 --> 1712.559
society has finally

1709.44 --> 1713.2
caught the infection and is starting to

1712.559 --> 1716.72
slowly

1713.2 --> 1720.0
fever up fever it out compartment

1716.72 --> 1721.6000000000001
like partially but partially is at least

1720.0 --> 1724.96
something

1721.6 --> 1728.24
right it seems like the the covet

1724.96 --> 1731.2
situation has finally

1728.24 --> 1731.84
caused a fever response to get this

1731.2 --> 1734.24
madness

1731.84 --> 1736.8799999999999
out of it out of the world out of

1734.24 --> 1736.88
society

1737.36 --> 1743.039
oh also god did anybody see that crazy

1740.64 --> 1743.039
video

1743.279 --> 1746.64
crazy crazy video of this woman

1745.52 --> 1749.039
paralyzed

1746.64 --> 1751.2
obviously by covet vaccine and then

1749.039 --> 1754.72
still promoting it

1751.2 --> 1754.72
like jesus

1755.76 --> 1762.08
is it that's a tragedy that person

1759.44 --> 1762.0800000000002
couldn't even

1762.96 --> 1767.76
like it it happened to her like and she

1765.76 --> 1770.399
literally was just

1767.76 --> 1770.399
defending

1770.799 --> 1776.08
defending the thing that's literally

1772.64 --> 1776.0800000000002
just ruined her life

1776.559 --> 1780.96
stockholm syndrome and it's blatantly

1780.24 --> 1784.08
obvious but

1780.96 --> 1786.24
man what a just in your face example of

1784.08 --> 1786.24
it

1786.799 --> 1795.84
hello miss crazy yet and andrew good to

1789.44 --> 1795.8400000000001
see you

1803.52 --> 1809.9189999999999
our wins jumper was about where you have

1806.159 --> 1812.24
your horse jumping over hurdles

1809.919 --> 1812.24
okay

1813.2 --> 1816.3990000000001
so somebody clipped that because i did

1815.279 --> 1819.679
talk about that

1816.399 --> 1822.7199999999998
some time ago because i did i did

1819.679 --> 1824.46
horseback riding when i was younger

1822.72 --> 1826.48
did it i think up to

1824.46 --> 1830.08
[Music]

1826.48 --> 1833.2
is it age 15 or 17

1830.08 --> 1837.84
i don't remember exactly when it quit

1833.2 --> 1837.8400000000001
i think it was up to age 15.

1838.799 --> 1842.24
i still have fond memories from it

1841.12 --> 1845.1999999999998
because

1842.24 --> 1846.799
like doing that actually gave me genuine

1845.2 --> 1849.44
confidence and

1846.799 --> 1850.24
more trust and understanding with

1849.44 --> 1853.3600000000001
animals

1850.24 --> 1854.2
for like horses also waiting a time when

1853.36 --> 1857.6789999999999
i was like

1854.2 --> 1860.96
completely not confident about myself

1857.679 --> 1861.519
socially like the example i just gave

1860.96 --> 1865.2
about

1861.519 --> 1867.679
how i bumped feeling not great and then

1865.2 --> 1869.2
yeah feeling other people's responses

1867.679 --> 1871.6000000000001
and essence and

1869.2 --> 1873.44
getting messed up about that well in

1871.6 --> 1877.76
that time when i was very young

1873.44 --> 1880.159
early teens i had that very badly

1877.76 --> 1881.519
so for me just sitting on that horse and

1880.159 --> 1884.88
kind of like owning

1881.519 --> 1886.48
it not literally financially but just

1884.88 --> 1890.0
owning the moment

1886.48 --> 1893.3600000000001
that was for me a great way to basically

1890.0 --> 1895.84
keep my composure while i was

1893.36 --> 1898.24
in between all kinds of girls and hey a

1895.84 --> 1900.1589999999999
lot of them were quite attractive

1898.24 --> 1902.159
but like definitely i wouldn't make a

1900.159 --> 1904.0
chance or so i felt that because i was

1902.159 --> 1907.44
totally unconfident

1904.0 --> 1909.279
but just doing horseback riding being

1907.44 --> 1912.24
good at it

1909.279 --> 1913.279
because i was pretty good at it probably

1912.24 --> 1916.0
still am if i

1913.279 --> 1916.0
try it again

1916.32 --> 1923.6
that yeah that did give me

1920.0 --> 1926.48
just a lot of good

1923.6 --> 1929.12
feeling of value for myself like i'm

1926.48 --> 1929.1200000000001
good at this

1929.44 --> 1932.799
and i'm i also i received respect for

1932.159 --> 1935.8400000000001
that

1932.799 --> 1937.6
right like i was an awkward person

1935.84 --> 1940.0
that's not very good socially

1937.6 --> 1943.4399999999998
communicating not very fluid

1940.0 --> 1946.159
but at least i was respectful

1943.44 --> 1948.48
and and good on a horse right so and i

1946.159 --> 1950.88
got genuine respect from that

1948.48 --> 1952.0
and that was like really like oh my god

1950.88 --> 1955.279
at least

1952.0 --> 1955.279
i'm doing something good

1955.44 --> 1959.8400000000001
right that was very desperate in ways i

1958.72 --> 1962.159
guess i still am

1959.84 --> 1963.039
i'm really working hard at it to just

1962.159 --> 1965.7600000000002
let that go

1963.039 --> 1969.44
right because it isn't actually other

1965.76 --> 1969.44
people that determine your value

1972.96 --> 1979.44
that was a very tough lesson for me

1976.08 --> 1982.48
to learn right because

1979.44 --> 1984.3200000000002
people can tell you yeah but it really

1982.48 --> 1986.72
doesn't matter what they think

1984.32 --> 1988.08
that's that might be technically true

1986.72 --> 1992.32
but if you're going to have

1988.08 --> 1995.36
massive influencing from their responses

1992.32 --> 1996.1589999999999
on on your state of being yeah that's

1995.36 --> 1999.1999999999998
just

1996.159 --> 2001.44
saying it it doesn't matter

1999.2 --> 2005.8400000000001
while the feelings say something

2001.44 --> 2005.8400000000001
different right very tough to deal with

2008.24 --> 2010.64
anyway

2017.44 --> 2022.24
right so yeah been very introspective

2023.519 --> 2028.0
i also finally had the telephone contact

2025.84 --> 2031.12
with my lawyer

2028.0 --> 2032.399
and the situation is is pretty good so

2031.12 --> 2035.36
far

2032.399 --> 2036.9599999999998
it seems like like nothing is going to

2035.36 --> 2047.84
happen

2036.96 --> 2047.8400000000001
so far

2048.24 --> 2052.56
with my uh the landlord situation

2054.48 --> 2060.72
so i'm finally about at peace about that

2058.639 --> 2063.119
because it's just a few like this

2060.72 --> 2063.1189999999997
weekend

2064.399 --> 2067.5989999999997
something might happen so i have to kind

2066.32 --> 2069.44
of stand guard that

2067.599 --> 2070.7200000000003
landlord's not gonna march in and do

2069.44 --> 2073.28
something like

2070.72 --> 2074.6389999999997
try to throw away my stuff again so i'm

2073.28 --> 2077.119
going to be guarding for that this

2074.639 --> 2080.3990000000003
weekend

2077.119 --> 2082.2400000000002
but other than that there's it's

2080.399 --> 2085.2799999999997
very unlikely he's actually going to

2082.24 --> 2085.2799999999997
step to the judge

2085.359 --> 2090.3199999999997
to try and get me out because he just

2087.04 --> 2090.32
has it doesn't have anything

2090.8 --> 2097.599
so that leads all nothing

2094.48 --> 2100.96
just i'm

2097.599 --> 2104.4
a very good boy

2100.96 --> 2107.839
right no criminal record

2104.4 --> 2110.2400000000002
at all like ever

2107.839 --> 2112.56
i'm never aggressive to people to their

2110.24 --> 2112.56
face

2113.44 --> 2117.359
in the real world like absolutely never

2115.52 --> 2119.28
on the internet yeah i've been kind of

2117.359 --> 2122.3199999999997
like

2119.28 --> 2126.2400000000002
been aggressive at times but

2122.32 --> 2128.7200000000003
even that i worked on containing that so

2126.24 --> 2130.64
comparing me now to say five years ago

2128.72 --> 2132.3999999999996
yeah i was kind of aggressive and out of

2130.64 --> 2135.839
control at times

2132.4 --> 2139.6800000000003
then again a lot of people

2135.839 --> 2143.359
on the scene had similar issues

2139.68 --> 2145.52
like the fl like to be a flat earther

2143.359 --> 2147.359
it's very stressful as it was in the

2145.52 --> 2149.839
beginning like there was a lot of like

2147.359 --> 2151.52
liberation sensation and like oh we can

2149.839 --> 2153.2
finally think about this and explore

2151.52 --> 2154.64
this and then

2153.2 --> 2156.3999999999996
puzzle out the world there was a lot to

2154.64 --> 2159.92
do but at the same time it was

2156.4 --> 2161.599
could be very stressful and it was a lot

2159.92 --> 2163.76
of frustration

2161.599 --> 2165.119
going around as well and people got

2163.76 --> 2168.1600000000003
aggressive at times

2165.119 --> 2169.359
we didn't really know how to deal with

2168.16 --> 2173.44
the rest

2169.359 --> 2178.64
the ballers now we've all

2173.44 --> 2178.64
kind of settled in there's like a

2179.28 --> 2184.8390000000004
we've all calmed down enough to really

2181.359 --> 2187.44
know what it is to be a flat earther

2184.839 --> 2189.52
just

2187.44 --> 2191.44
so we've all had opportunities to deal

2189.52 --> 2194.56
with that aggression

2191.44 --> 2196.32
that might arise and i have i certainly

2194.56 --> 2197.2799999999997
have i've dealt with it in all kinds of

2196.32 --> 2198.96
ways

2197.28 --> 2201.8390000000004
and i'd like to think that i'm a lot

2198.96 --> 2201.839
less aggressive these days

2202.32 --> 2208.7200000000003
maybe even a little bit too stale one

2205.44 --> 2210.7200000000003
certain people might say i'm like too

2208.72 --> 2215.839
calm now

2210.72 --> 2215.839
maybe i don't know

2226.4 --> 2229.839
right so anyway

2230.16 --> 2234.48
man i'm certainly rambling on

2236.72 --> 2239.8599999999997
[Music]

2240.24 --> 2245.52
i'm just really happy that my jaw is not

2242.56 --> 2248.7999999999997
giving me trouble right now because

2245.52 --> 2251.68
it had been like most of the night

2248.8 --> 2253.6800000000003
like even during sleep and that's just

2251.68 --> 2257.2
really annoying and it's pretty

2253.68 --> 2259.359
amazing that i can still rest with it

2257.2 --> 2261.2
i do still rest but it is kind of just

2259.359 --> 2265.5989999999997
like

2261.2 --> 2265.5989999999997
i just want it to go away as quickly as

2268.839 --> 2271.839
possible

2276.64 --> 2285.839
so what are you guys

2279.68 --> 2285.839
and gals up to

2296.01 --> 2300.96
[Music]

2298.88 --> 2313.839
is anybody out there it's been silent in

2300.96 --> 2313.839
chat for 10 minutes

2317.04 --> 2320.72
i mean do you have any supporting

2319.04 --> 2323.52
arguments or are you just trying to

2320.72 --> 2327.04
figure out what i'm trying to say

2323.52 --> 2329.92
you know sometimes i have a bit trouble

2327.04 --> 2330.8
knowing how much you guys can actually

2329.92 --> 2333.839
follow me

2330.8 --> 2334.079
when i talk about my internal workings

2333.839 --> 2336.24
and

2334.079 --> 2337.8390000000004
reflections on things i don't know for

2336.24 --> 2341.68
sure

2337.839 --> 2344.96
i know that i'm being consistent

2341.68 --> 2347.5989999999997
it's just that it's hard to to know

2344.96 --> 2347.599
how much

2348.0 --> 2351.04
you guys actually get it or reflect on

2350.48 --> 2353.28
it like

2351.04 --> 2355.119
maybe you're just maybe it's like really

2353.28 --> 2356.1600000000003
good and that's why you're silent

2355.119 --> 2358.56
because you're like just

2356.16 --> 2360.24
actively reflecting it up on your own

2358.56 --> 2361.2
things and then just getting all kinds

2360.24 --> 2364.56
of things out of it

2361.2 --> 2367.7599999999998
in in the dream as it were or

2364.56 --> 2369.599
it might be that you're like uh okay

2367.76 --> 2371.28
i don't really know what to say about

2369.599 --> 2373.52
that and that's why they're silent

2371.28 --> 2373.52
because

2376.0 --> 2380.24
because of that reason i'm never really

2378.0 --> 2380.24
sure

2380.4 --> 2384.64
you're cooking while listening all right

2385.2 --> 2390.64
what are you cooking and clutch bear

2387.2 --> 2390.64
hello welcome to chat

2391.599 --> 2397.839
if you say something stupid we will be

2393.92 --> 2397.839
sure to let you know

2398.32 --> 2401.839
all right andrew i appreciate that i

2400.8 --> 2404.96
guess

2401.839 --> 2405.52
i didn't mean like just necessarily for

2404.96 --> 2407.92
people

2405.52 --> 2409.44
to point out that i might say something

2407.92 --> 2411.839
stupid it's rather

2409.44 --> 2411.839
that like

2412.64 --> 2416.0
there's not just a black and white

2414.16 --> 2419.839
division between stupid

2416.0 --> 2419.839
and correct okay

2420.0 --> 2423.52
i'm just trying to figure out is what

2422.8 --> 2426.96
i'm saying

2423.52 --> 2430.16
actually connecting for you

2426.96 --> 2431.359
or or is this just to you like okay this

2430.16 --> 2433.68
is just our win

2431.359 --> 2435.2
needs to talk about himself time and you

2433.68 --> 2437.52
don't really pay attention

2435.2 --> 2452.96
i don't know i don't know for sure

2437.52 --> 2455.7599999999998
that's why i asked

2452.96 --> 2457.839
like different states of being right

2455.76 --> 2459.8390000000004
different moods that you're in

2457.839 --> 2461.2
like the outside world reflects

2459.839 --> 2463.599
differently on it

2461.2 --> 2466.16
so what are your experiences with that

2463.599 --> 2469.04
and how do you tend to reflect upon

2466.16 --> 2470.96
when you feel kind of bad and you notice

2469.04 --> 2472.4
that the entire world is responding to

2470.96 --> 2475.92
you like that

2472.4 --> 2475.92
how do you reflect on that

2476.8 --> 2483.76
because probably everyone goes

2480.0 --> 2485.68
through those times and then again when

2483.76 --> 2488.48
you get out of it you kind of quickly

2485.68 --> 2495.839
forget about it

2488.48 --> 2495.839
you just go back into the flow

2506.89 --> 2510.0699999999997
[Music]

2529.68 --> 2537.839
all right

2538.94 --> 2542.059
[Music]

2558.079 --> 2565.8390000000004
talking to me about a lot of that's

2561.04 --> 2565.839
fascinating that you say that

2566.88 --> 2575.359
because sometimes i do something that

2571.68 --> 2578.64
that's weird i do something weird i

2575.359 --> 2582.56
i try to communicate

2578.64 --> 2584.16
fractally okay this this is an orbitian

2582.56 --> 2585.92
thing and i'm probably not the only one

2584.16 --> 2588.0
that does it it's just that i've always

2585.92 --> 2590.88
been very fascinated by

2588.0 --> 2591.599
by the structure of how people

2590.88 --> 2594.6400000000003
experience

2591.599 --> 2596.0
things and how experiences separatedly

2594.64 --> 2598.48
actually work

2596.0 --> 2599.359
and when you pick up on a certain

2598.48 --> 2602.48
experience

2599.359 --> 2605.2
and then explain it without

2602.48 --> 2607.119
tying it down to specific time and place

2605.2 --> 2608.64
experience

2607.119 --> 2610.319
right because then you get like

2608.64 --> 2613.44
analytical descriptive

2610.319 --> 2614.96
about that in that moment then you get

2613.44 --> 2618.0
very tied down very

2614.96 --> 2619.119
physical if you just explain the

2618.0 --> 2622.56
structure

2619.119 --> 2623.359
i'm always wondering like wow what are

2622.56 --> 2625.52
people

2623.359 --> 2626.72
what is it like to reflect on that for

2625.52 --> 2629.599
somebody else

2626.72 --> 2632.319
and does it indeed fit the pattern

2629.599 --> 2636.8
because i always try to find the pattern

2632.319 --> 2639.119
of how things work in the experience

2636.8 --> 2641.52
and then express it according to that

2639.119 --> 2641.52
pattern

2642.4 --> 2648.079
because that way

2645.44 --> 2649.68
if i don't get super physically specific

2648.079 --> 2654.4
in it in a specific time

2649.68 --> 2658.24
moment then just explaining that may be

2654.4 --> 2661.44
almost like like a book reference like a

2658.24 --> 2662.3999999999996
an event that you have your reflections

2661.44 --> 2665.839
on

2662.4 --> 2668.1600000000003
like even in other time periods because

2665.839 --> 2670.319
i'm presuming that these experience are

2668.16 --> 2672.0
kind of universal like i'm not the only

2670.319 --> 2674.319
one that's going to have these types of

2672.0 --> 2677.2
experiences so if i just lay down the

2674.319 --> 2680.8
raw structure

2677.2 --> 2683.359
then it may reflect upon a lot of people

2680.8 --> 2685.8390000000004
in all kinds of time periods like they

2683.359 --> 2686.72
might watch this in five years and then

2685.839 --> 2690.56
be like whoa

2686.72 --> 2693.04
yeah dude right

2690.56 --> 2693.92
that's kind of what i've been trying to

2693.04 --> 2697.599
do a lot

2693.92 --> 2700.2400000000002
because that that way you avoid

2697.599 --> 2702.7200000000003
incrimination of some kind potentially

2700.24 --> 2704.24
accidentally somebody that doesn't want

2702.72 --> 2707.68
to be

2704.24 --> 2710.7999999999997
talked about but

2707.68 --> 2712.96
you still can

2710.8 --> 2714.5600000000004
present like the conflict and the

2712.96 --> 2716.88
reflections upon it

2714.56 --> 2719.119
and figure out the structure and the

2716.88 --> 2722.48
proper response

2719.119 --> 2724.48
like throughout time right you don't

2722.48 --> 2727.44
have to be super specific you just have

2724.48 --> 2730.0
to figure out the pattern

2727.44 --> 2733.119
and then when you lay out what you

2730.0 --> 2736.8
typically deal with in that pattern

2733.119 --> 2739.04
then others can always

2736.8 --> 2742.079
use it they can recognize the pattern

2739.04 --> 2742.079
even if they don't

2742.24 --> 2748.3999999999996
realize that they might just feel it

2746.079 --> 2750.5600000000004
and then the the processes of

2748.4 --> 2752.079
recognition and reflection will just

2750.56 --> 2754.16
happen

2752.079 --> 2757.28
right okay this this sounds maybe a

2754.16 --> 2760.3999999999996
little mystical at this point

2757.28 --> 2763.2000000000003
but yeah fractal

2760.4 --> 2763.2000000000003
explanations

2764.8 --> 2768.96
patterns that will always resonate

2769.2 --> 2775.2799999999997
or might yeah if you have actually

2772.319 --> 2775.599
if you hit that frequency that's part of

2775.28 --> 2779.94
you

2775.599 --> 2782.079
too anyway

2779.94 --> 2783.52
[Music]

2782.079 --> 2785.599
thank you for the feedback by the way

2783.52 --> 2787.599
cameron kaze gilmore

2785.599 --> 2789.839
know how to put it in words i think

2787.599 --> 2790.88
everyone gets different benefits from

2789.839 --> 2794.16
other

2790.88 --> 2794.1600000000003
with like mindsets

2794.4 --> 2799.839
yes i agree to that andrew

2800.839 --> 2803.839
also

2804.64 --> 2808.56
having other people that are doing the

2806.88 --> 2811.6800000000003
same things trying the same things

2808.56 --> 2813.92
dealing with the same issues

2811.68 --> 2817.2799999999997
gives you kind of like recognition that

2813.92 --> 2821.44
it's real it kind of helps you

2817.28 --> 2824.2400000000002
tie down things that you're dealing with

2821.44 --> 2826.319
so it's not like dwelling secretly in

2824.24 --> 2829.7599999999998
the background anymore

2826.319 --> 2833.04
elusive to your grasp

2829.76 --> 2834.0
that's why just standard therapeutics is

2833.04 --> 2837.839
always just

2834.0 --> 2840.559
just talk to somebody about it like

2837.839 --> 2842.0789999999997
just just try to explain it just put it

2840.559 --> 2845.119
down

2842.079 --> 2847.3590000000004
and then you kind of solidify it and and

2845.119 --> 2849.359
potentially see things once you start

2847.359 --> 2851.04
writing about it or talking about it you

2849.359 --> 2853.44
start to

2851.04 --> 2856.48
see much more as to what it is and get a

2853.44 --> 2856.48
better grasp on it

2856.8 --> 2861.28
basic therapy therapy basic therapy

2870.839 --> 2875.599
universal

2872.319 --> 2876.4
wow cameron comic is coming cameron

2875.599 --> 2878.6400000000003
comic has a game

2876.4 --> 2882.7200000000003
it's trippy i feel you speak to me

2878.64 --> 2885.44
through innuendos and subconscious cues

2882.72 --> 2886.64
learning not to take it personal and

2885.44 --> 2890.4
learn from

2886.64 --> 2890.4
that thank you

2890.559 --> 2894.0
i yeah

2894.559 --> 2898.7200000000003
it would be more amazing if you if if

2896.72 --> 2900.5589999999997
you could even lay out an example of

2898.72 --> 2904.72
that more concrete

2900.559 --> 2904.7200000000003
but that is i guess what that is

2907.68 --> 2915.2799999999997
right because i'm always assuming

2912.0 --> 2918.8
people always have more things that tie

2915.28 --> 2921.44
into an experience and i'm always

2918.8 --> 2921.92
i'm kind of like trying to provide like

2921.44 --> 2926.0
this

2921.92 --> 2929.28
room for you to to realize that

2926.0 --> 2930.96
without us me having to know it

2929.28 --> 2933.44
specifically

2930.96 --> 2934.2400000000002
right i guess that is really

2933.44 --> 2938.2400000000002
self-conscious

2934.24 --> 2943.839
cues and and through innuendo

2938.24 --> 2943.839
to hear it blows my mind in this moment

2948.65 --> 2951.599
[Music]

2949.839 --> 2956.88
that's awesome thank you for the

2951.599 --> 2958.96
feedback i really appreciate that

2956.88 --> 2960.4
hello by the way jado good to see you in

2958.96 --> 2964.319
chat

2960.4 --> 2964.319
ready maddie crow

2967.92 --> 2976.2400000000002
yeah i'm gonna give you a wrench

2971.2 --> 2976.24
you're pretty awesome and you too

2977.839 --> 2985.839
and you too

2992.64 --> 2997.44
nathan r chapinater i might give you

2995.119 --> 3000.319
wrenches too in the future

2997.44 --> 3001.04
but yeah you've arrived in chat pretty

3000.319 --> 3003.68
recently

3001.04 --> 3004.64
so i never i never really give wrenches

3003.68 --> 3007.52
out

3004.64 --> 3010.8799999999997
to people that i don't know for a while

3007.52 --> 3012.8
had some bad experiences with that

3010.88 --> 3015.28
i do really appreciate your presence in

3012.8 --> 3015.28
chat though

3015.56 --> 3019.27
[Music]

3025.44 --> 3032.16
right but the funny thing also is right

3029.04 --> 3035.2799999999997
is in a way my form of communication and

3032.16 --> 3038.3999999999996
laying out scenarios and all that

3035.28 --> 3040.8
and mechanisms and dealing with things

3038.4 --> 3042.8
and leaving it open for other people to

3040.8 --> 3043.92
reflect upon their own personal

3042.8 --> 3046.88
experience with it

3043.92 --> 3049.2000000000003
even though they're not sharing that in

3046.88 --> 3049.2000000000003
a way

3050.48 --> 3059.28
movies television

3055.44 --> 3059.28
kind of does that as well

3059.599 --> 3066.7200000000003
right i'm very used to having

3062.64 --> 3069.2
watched movies series

3066.72 --> 3070.0789999999997
and then reflecting on it my own things

3069.2 --> 3073.2799999999997
and like

3070.079 --> 3077.119
overlaying how that fits well

3073.28 --> 3083.8390000000004
it was probably designed to do that

3077.119 --> 3083.839
in a way

3084.4 --> 3089.04
but yeah with other agendas and tying it

3087.04 --> 3091.2
down more specifically and all that

3089.04 --> 3093.2799999999997
but it's kind of doing that as well it

3091.2 --> 3096.8799999999997
is like storytelling

3093.28 --> 3099.52
trying to make it memorable

3096.88 --> 3100.319
but yeah series and movies are of course

3099.52 --> 3103.48
completely

3100.319 --> 3111.839
pre-designed and i do it

3103.48 --> 3111.839
spontaneously that's the difference

3117.52 --> 3122.16
yes jado thank you for the feedback

3120.559 --> 3124.559
we're all listening because we're on the

3122.16 --> 3128.0789999999997
same frequency we don't always agree

3124.559 --> 3128.079
but we're on the same pathway

3132.24 --> 3136.8799999999997
right communication more importantly

3135.359 --> 3138.7999999999997
the listening is the key to

3136.88 --> 3142.4
understanding right

3138.8 --> 3145.92
well first you have to listen then

3142.4 --> 3146.8
it has to be received right sometimes

3145.92 --> 3148.96
you can listen

3146.8 --> 3150.0
but you can't you just can't hear it

3148.96 --> 3152.16
still

3150.0 --> 3154.559
because there's something blocking it

3152.16 --> 3155.7599999999998
and then what that is might be concealed

3154.559 --> 3157.3590000000004
to you so you

3155.76 --> 3159.599
there's people listening and they just

3157.359 --> 3162.7999999999997
still don't get it

3159.599 --> 3166.8
i i had i've had that issue

3162.8 --> 3171.52
myself it's like

3166.8 --> 3171.52
when i demand to understand something

3173.119 --> 3179.359
but when i do that i kind of like look

3176.4 --> 3181.359
past the obstacles that are actually not

3179.359 --> 3183.119
making me understand it

3181.359 --> 3185.68
because i still want to know and then it

3183.119 --> 3185.6800000000003
doesn't work

3191.76 --> 3195.599
but yeah i think that most of you here

3194.24 --> 3198.0
are definitely

3195.599 --> 3199.52
definitely not having such obstacles you

3198.0 --> 3201.92
would have spoken out about it

3199.52 --> 3203.599
because i also demand you reveal that

3201.92 --> 3207.28
right reveal the obstacles

3203.599 --> 3208.7200000000003
we'll deal with it hey tiny wumbo by the

3207.28 --> 3212.2400000000002
way hello

3208.72 --> 3215.839
lovely page jumper channel

3212.24 --> 3223.839
again what's so special about the jumper

3215.839 --> 3223.839
channel serious

3234.839 --> 3241.7599999999998
uh

3236.88 --> 3241.76
right when you say we don't always agree

3241.839 --> 3244.72
in what sense

3246.8 --> 3250.0
is it a philosophical disagreement as in

3249.52 --> 3251.92
like no

3250.0 --> 3253.52
that's not the way to do it or is it

3251.92 --> 3258.64
rather like

3253.52 --> 3258.64
no if i were you i wouldn't do that

3259.2 --> 3262.5589999999997
what what is the nature of the

3262.839 --> 3268.4
disagreement

3264.96 --> 3272.8
because i probably do and decide to

3268.4 --> 3275.28
do and not do things that are very much

3272.8 --> 3277.599
strayed away from what how a lot of

3275.28 --> 3280.88
people go about in life

3277.599 --> 3284.0
i'm i'm weird that way right

3280.88 --> 3284.48
but that's my life that's like what i do

3284.0 --> 3287.76
and i

3284.48 --> 3291.599
am weird like that i've tried

3287.76 --> 3292.0
not to be that i don't know if i could

3291.599 --> 3294.319
ever

3292.0 --> 3294.319
really

3296.4 --> 3301.76
yeah get there but at the same time i

3300.16 --> 3305.52
have skills

3301.76 --> 3307.3590000000004
even though i'm not good at that and

3305.52 --> 3309.119
there's something good i can do with

3307.359 --> 3312.24
those skills and it's like

3309.119 --> 3316.4
okay according to god's logic

3312.24 --> 3319.4399999999996
i must do that just because i i can't

3316.4 --> 3321.119
get fulfilled in certain way

3319.44 --> 3323.839
even though i really want to doesn't

3321.119 --> 3325.599
mean that i can then just completely

3323.839 --> 3328.64
give up on everything

3325.599 --> 3332.319
i have to use the skills that i have

3328.64 --> 3335.7599999999998
that i discover and and basically work

3332.319 --> 3339.68
on them and then hopefully for that

3335.76 --> 3339.6800000000003
attain long-term redemption

3343.44 --> 3348.7200000000003
philosophical practical and ideological

3346.839 --> 3350.96
what

3348.72 --> 3352.72
okay now you're making me curious can

3350.96 --> 3354.4
you be more specific

3352.72 --> 3356.799
is there something that really stood out

3354.4 --> 3363.839
that you just say like no you always say

3356.799 --> 3363.839
this and i completely disagree

3388.19 --> 3391.289
[Music]

3403.599 --> 3407.119
okay when it comes to practical

3405.599 --> 3409.2000000000003
disagreements i i

3407.119 --> 3412.1600000000003
yeah that probably applies to what i try

3409.2 --> 3412.16
to explain before

3412.72 --> 3418.8799999999997
i'm a little weird i do things

3415.2 --> 3424.0789999999997
differently than most people

3418.88 --> 3424.079
and yeah that can be a thorn in your eye

3424.64 --> 3427.2
or not

3428.48 --> 3432.0
i might not be the only person that is

3430.96 --> 3435.44
like that that you've

3432.0 --> 3436.96
known although i bet that the other

3435.44 --> 3439.599
people that you've met that

3436.96 --> 3442.2400000000002
have that same oddity to them they

3439.599 --> 3445.6800000000003
probably have a lot more issues

3442.24 --> 3449.52
that they display compared to

3445.68 --> 3453.04
me because i like really

3449.52 --> 3453.04
really tried to work on it

3453.52 --> 3457.68
but as for philosophical disagreements

3456.0 --> 3459.68
or ideological

3457.68 --> 3461.5989999999997
i find it weird that you would drag in

3459.68 --> 3465.5989999999997
ideology

3461.599 --> 3470.319
but what philosophical things

3465.599 --> 3470.319
are you in disagreement about jado

3472.799 --> 3477.04
i'd be curious to try and explore the

3475.44 --> 3487.88
differences here

3477.04 --> 3491.579
if you're up for it

3487.88 --> 3491.579
[Music]

3503.85 --> 3507.0
[Music]

3514.839 --> 3517.839
hmm

3536.079 --> 3539.2000000000003
no problems well

3543.44 --> 3549.44
now i'm i'm not trying to i'm not trying

3546.96 --> 3551.359
to pull you out by the roots to seek

3549.44 --> 3552.7200000000003
some kind of conflict or something i'm

3551.359 --> 3555.119
just curious as to

3552.72 --> 3559.839
you see a disagreement i wonder about

3555.119 --> 3559.839
what then

3570.16 --> 3574.0789999999997
hey good servant good to see you good

3583.23 --> 3587.839
[Music]

3584.839 --> 3587.839
morning

3598.839 --> 3601.839
then

3627.28 --> 3633.8390000000004
i have to hear the news

3631.119 --> 3634.88
with the ea i take it in the morning

3633.839 --> 3638.319
here and realize

3634.88 --> 3640.839
that nothing is real is it that bad

3638.319 --> 3642.16
i haven't listened to like a mainstream

3640.839 --> 3644.96
news

3642.16 --> 3645.839
thing in a long time because every time

3644.96 --> 3649.359
i do it's like

3645.839 --> 3651.04
wow and i thought that cnn 10 years ago

3649.359 --> 3654.0
was bad

3651.04 --> 3654.0
like this is just

3654.16 --> 3660.799
like beyond dystopian sci-fi

3657.92 --> 3661.76
level what's coming out these days like

3660.799 --> 3665.04
people are like

3661.76 --> 3666.7200000000003
literally like publicly signing

3665.04 --> 3671.839
contracts with the devil with

3666.72 --> 3671.839
what they put out it's so insane

3681.52 --> 3690.0
like you have to wonder like do they

3686.0 --> 3690.0
actually realize what they're doing

3690.88 --> 3696.96
and what could have kept

3694.48 --> 3700.799
them withheld them from understanding

3696.96 --> 3700.799
what they're engaging with right now

3709.599 --> 3713.76
nothing is faker than reality well

3711.92 --> 3726.64
that's a self-contradicting statement

3713.76 --> 3729.2000000000003
there pat fee

3726.64 --> 3732.72
okay good sir but nobody sees it or they

3729.2 --> 3732.72
just stop paying attention

3734.799 --> 3738.799
it can be that people are just letting

3736.799 --> 3741.28
it slide because they don't want to

3738.799 --> 3743.52
think about it anymore

3741.28 --> 3743.52
right

3749.119 --> 3756.6400000000003
then again i i don't really know

3753.119 --> 3759.599
how demoralized they really are

3756.64 --> 3762.0
the ones that actually believe that the

3759.599 --> 3764.4
vaccine works and all that

3762.0 --> 3765.599
i don't know how bad it actually is i

3764.4 --> 3768.2400000000002
can't reach

3765.599 --> 3769.52
there anymore it sounds weird right

3768.24 --> 3772.72
arwen

3769.52 --> 3773.839
interdimensional spirit digger i can't

3772.72 --> 3778.3999999999996
reach it anymore i

3773.839 --> 3778.4
i can't emulate what it's like

3778.96 --> 3786.64
to be that undercover

3783.76 --> 3786.6400000000003
from reality

3789.76 --> 3796.2400000000002
also that i just i can't get my spirit

3793.52 --> 3799.0389999999998
to want to know

3796.24 --> 3801.5989999999997
so i'm not just and yeah people that are

3799.039 --> 3804.0
so far

3801.599 --> 3805.039
undercover from reality that's really a

3804.0 --> 3810.72
good description

3805.039 --> 3812.96
of it like being undercover from reality

3810.72 --> 3813.9199999999996
so you know everything is pretty much

3812.96 --> 3815.92
going to [ __ ]

3813.92 --> 3816.96
you just can't deal with it so you're

3815.92 --> 3820.319
just

3816.96 --> 3820.319
ignoring everything

3822.88 --> 3828.2400000000002
acting like nothing's nothing strange is

3825.76 --> 3828.2400000000002
going on

3829.839 --> 3839.839
what yeah jado i wasn't talking about

3833.119 --> 3839.839
ranty in this case

3840.96 --> 3844.4
if you believe you are rocketing through

3843.52 --> 3853.839
space

3844.4 --> 3853.839
you will believe anything nah

3854.4 --> 3860.48
i don't think that people use

3858.16 --> 3860.48
that

3861.76 --> 3867.8390000000004
to basically justify what they're doing

3864.4 --> 3867.839
i can't imagine they are

3871.92 --> 3876.88
like yeah heliocentrism space fantasy

3875.599 --> 3881.839
sci-fi

3876.88 --> 3881.839
it might be like a an escape valve

3882.88 --> 3888.96
to just dig in and not let reality

3885.92 --> 3892.16
burden you like that but to really

3888.96 --> 3895.839
use it as an excuse to get this crazy

3892.16 --> 3895.839
in the world

3902.799 --> 3907.52
no that that makes no sense like you

3905.44 --> 3909.68
wouldn't be able to enjoy it

3907.52 --> 3912.24
it would just be a quick excuse it would

3909.68 --> 3913.7599999999998
just be a tactic to try and preoccupy

3912.24 --> 3915.839
everybody

3913.76 --> 3917.44
if you're doing all this nasty [ __ ] you

3915.839 --> 3920.0789999999997
can't enjoy

3917.44 --> 3920.079
sci-fi

3921.52 --> 3924.88
like the worse your actions are and you

3924.24 --> 3926.799
know it

3924.88 --> 3929.6800000000003
in your spirit doesn't even matter like

3926.799 --> 3933.44
what program you uphold for yourself to

3929.68 --> 3935.9199999999996
think it is whatever you're doing it's

3933.44 --> 3937.52
it's going to take away the joy like you

3935.92 --> 3941.52
can't really effectively

3937.52 --> 3944.72
escape into fantasy if you're

3941.52 --> 3947.28
yeah if you're doing something really

3944.72 --> 3947.2799999999997
[ __ ] up

3949.359 --> 3954.96
right a little rest ahead

3956.64 --> 3965.839
huh whoa

3974.319 --> 3981.2799999999997
dude rastad if you keep this up your

3977.44 --> 3981.28
biceps is going to be bigger than your

3990.839 --> 3993.839
head

3996.48 --> 4010.57
i'll share your picture for a second

4006.82 --> 4010.57
[Music]

4032.839 --> 4035.839
oh

4036.64 --> 4049.839
right this is rasta hat just sent me

4040.079 --> 4049.8390000000004
this picture

4050.799 --> 4063.839
yeah that's some big freaking biceps

4052.72 --> 4063.839
there dude

4065.44 --> 4079.52
do they still have wrestling

4076.079 --> 4082.2400000000002
ah ready medigrow

4079.52 --> 4082.72
sci-fi know the same shame i used to

4082.24 --> 4087.2
like it

4082.72 --> 4087.2
what no i disagree

4087.44 --> 4094.16
i still like sci-fi

4090.64 --> 4096.159
it's not as guess i guess is mysterious

4094.16 --> 4098.0
and glorious as it used to be

4096.159 --> 4100.96
right when you truly believe that it

4098.0 --> 4104.159
might somehow be possible

4100.96 --> 4107.359
but still

4104.159 --> 4108.0
i still like wrecking well not as not

4107.359 --> 4111.6
regular

4108.0 --> 4111.6
it go it has ups and downs

4113.759 --> 4118.159
right but like last year i watched

4116.159 --> 4121.759
babylon 5 again the whole series

4118.159 --> 4126.08
like just like here we go again did

4121.759 --> 4128.08
that was great it's good enough and also

4126.08 --> 4129.839
a funny thing is though that you really

4128.08 --> 4133.6
start to see

4129.839 --> 4135.5199999999995
in sci-fi is

4133.6 --> 4137.120000000001
when you when you figure out that space

4135.52 --> 4141.1990000000005
is fake and all that

4137.12 --> 4142.4
you start to see you start to see the

4141.199 --> 4145.44
stage

4142.4 --> 4148.639999999999
you start to see the stage craft

4145.44 --> 4151.759
of sci-fi you start to see how

4148.64 --> 4154.719
like how they build

4151.759 --> 4154.719
the stage up

4155.359 --> 4161.279
much more than when you're just an

4158.08 --> 4163.679
actual sci-fi believer

4161.279 --> 4166.0
and that's something that i kind of like

4163.679 --> 4169.4400000000005
you start to see the theatrics of it

4166.0 --> 4169.839
basically and that i don't know that's

4169.44 --> 4174.48
been

4169.839 --> 4177.44
very entertaining and interesting

4174.48 --> 4177.759
so no i totally still appreciate sci-fi

4177.44 --> 4181.12
but

4177.759 --> 4183.44
yes in the beginning when

4181.12 --> 4185.679
like your heart broken figuring out it's

4183.44 --> 4187.678999999999
fake yeah then it sucks

4185.679 --> 4189.6
and then you feel might feel very like

4187.679 --> 4192.08
lie to and even like oh

4189.6 --> 4194.0
you might even have the sensation like

4192.08 --> 4195.76
through all that demons are trying to

4194.0 --> 4197.199
get to you make you forget again or

4195.76 --> 4201.360000000001
something like i've had that

4197.199 --> 4205.759999999999
in the beginning five years ago

4201.36 --> 4209.839999999999
but once you get over that initial

4205.76 --> 4213.52
transition it's kind of up to you

4209.84 --> 4216.159000000001
right i still watch

4213.52 --> 4216.56
sci-fi and then i basically judge it

4216.159 --> 4219.04
like

4216.56 --> 4220.4800000000005
uh what is the quality of this what are

4219.04 --> 4222.96
the issues with it

4220.48 --> 4225.44
and i still enjoy it and i still even

4222.96 --> 4228.88
get to enjoy like space

4225.44 --> 4231.759999999999
space fantasy right

4228.88 --> 4233.679
like even like the initial things like

4231.76 --> 4236.719
sensation of like oh my god

4233.679 --> 4238.0
how scary is it to be in a suit in a

4236.719 --> 4240.159
vacuum right

4238.0 --> 4242.08
i know that technically that's all

4240.159 --> 4245.44
ridiculous

4242.08 --> 4246.4
but i remember the original ideas about

4245.44 --> 4250.08
it

4246.4 --> 4253.199
the fantastical sensations

4250.08 --> 4253.199
associated with it

4253.679 --> 4259.84
and i can still have those moments

4267.76 --> 4272.88
yes pat fee that's fake as well that's

4270.4 --> 4276.239
right it's all fake

4272.88 --> 4279.4400000000005
you see what you see through your

4276.239 --> 4282.48
telescope you see through your telescope

4279.44 --> 4284.719
it's just that you have been taught to

4282.48 --> 4286.0
made to assume that what you're seeing

4284.719 --> 4288.719
is actually a physical

4286.0 --> 4290.56
object that has been shown to you

4288.719 --> 4294.2390000000005
through cgi

4290.56 --> 4298.719
very elaborately cgi and before that

4294.239 --> 4301.199
age paintings it was clearly established

4298.719 --> 4301.92
as to how you were supposed to think of

4301.199 --> 4304.0
it

4301.92 --> 4305.36
and the paintings were very beautiful

4304.0 --> 4308.08
and appealing and

4305.36 --> 4309.04
may would tantalize the imagination

4308.08 --> 4312.64
about it

4309.04 --> 4316.8
so then the imagination fantasy

4312.64 --> 4318.719
about it replaces in your mind

4316.8 --> 4328.159000000001
the actual site that you see through the

4318.719 --> 4330.4
telescope that's what happens

4328.159 --> 4332.239
because you want to know more about what

4330.4 --> 4334.5599999999995
you're seeing

4332.239 --> 4337.04
but you'd have no way to attain it so

4334.56 --> 4340.88
you reach out

4337.04 --> 4342.56
to sources that will tell you like this

4340.88 --> 4344.88
is what it's supposed to look like up

4342.56 --> 4346.96
close and then it's like okay well that

4344.88 --> 4348.96
kind of reminds me of what i look at

4346.96 --> 4351.12
through the telescope

4348.96 --> 4353.12
it seems like there's a consensus on how

4351.12 --> 4355.5199999999995
to represent this thing

4353.12 --> 4357.36
well then that must be it and then in

4355.52 --> 4359.52
your mind

4357.36 --> 4360.96
as you look through the telescope you

4359.52 --> 4362.719
see that thing

4360.96 --> 4364.56
but you no longer see it for what it is

4362.719 --> 4367.36
now instead in your mind you

4364.56 --> 4369.52
are projecting those paintings of the

4367.36 --> 4370.0
planet and the rings and up close and

4369.52 --> 4374.400000000001
look what

4370.0 --> 4374.4
it that's replacing in your mind

4375.28 --> 4380.32
the image of what you're actually seeing

4377.6 --> 4382.159000000001
that's part of the trick

4380.32 --> 4384.88
that's how they make you project the

4382.159 --> 4386.799999999999
fantasy on top of it

4384.88 --> 4388.159000000001
and it's all grounded in physicality

4386.8 --> 4390.400000000001
assumption bias because

4388.159 --> 4391.839999999999
like yeah what else are they what

4390.4 --> 4393.5199999999995
holograms

4391.84 --> 4395.360000000001
right everybody has that response like

4393.52 --> 4397.1990000000005
what holograms they're holograms it's

4395.36 --> 4399.28
just light that makes no sense where's

4397.199 --> 4402.879999999999
it coming from all these questions

4399.28 --> 4404.96
right so to just assume it's a physical

4402.88 --> 4407.36
thing

4404.96 --> 4408.32
and then having personal reflections

4407.36 --> 4411.44
upon all these

4408.32 --> 4414.5599999999995
images all these paintings of the planet

4411.44 --> 4417.04
as it's represented that's much easier

4414.56 --> 4418.320000000001
there's so much material out there for

4417.04 --> 4422.56
you to do that

4418.32 --> 4424.5599999999995
see it's much easier than to just

4422.56 --> 4426.400000000001
get honest and realize like wait i'm

4424.56 --> 4431.6
just seeing a picture

4426.4 --> 4431.599999999999
like a some weird light thing

4431.679 --> 4437.52
with cyclical nature in the entire setup

4434.96 --> 4438.64
yeah that's it that's the only evidence

4437.52 --> 4440.64
you have well that's

4438.64 --> 4442.56
much tougher to get really strict on

4440.64 --> 4443.4400000000005
yourself and just discard everything and

4442.56 --> 4446.96
just realize

4443.44 --> 4450.4
how little you actually have data wise

4446.96 --> 4450.4
of that phenomenon

4452.159 --> 4456.639999999999
right took me quite some discipline to

4454.8 --> 4460.64
do it

4456.64 --> 4461.52
at first because i was very much in love

4460.64 --> 4465.04
with the

4461.52 --> 4467.4400000000005
imagery with the paintings like

4465.04 --> 4469.239
i really fell in love with that [ __ ] at

4467.44 --> 4470.48
a very young age when i saw my

4469.239 --> 4474.0
encyclopedia

4470.48 --> 4478.0
first thing i did scroll

4474.0 --> 4480.4
to the where the the solar system

4478.0 --> 4482.64
and look at the painting of that amazing

4480.4 --> 4484.0
sun and all the planets oh this one's a

4482.64 --> 4486.8
big one that's

4484.0 --> 4488.96
beautiful i love that oh and like the

4486.8 --> 4492.320000000001
molten iron core and lava

4488.96 --> 4494.4800000000005
fruit volcano i had an encyclopedia with

4492.32 --> 4496.32
really beautiful paintings and they

4494.48 --> 4499.839999999999
impressed me so much i

4496.32 --> 4500.96
i fell in love with that [ __ ] in love

4499.84 --> 4505.92
with it

4500.96 --> 4505.92
nerd love very young

4508.0 --> 4513.84
it's made like that it is a fantastical

4522.84 --> 4525.84
fantasy

4530.48 --> 4536.579
beings made a light what

4533.47 --> 4536.579000000001
[Music]

4536.84 --> 4539.84
uh

4549.52 --> 4553.84
angel's okay

4555.36 --> 4561.679
right so bit personifying though

4559.199 --> 4562.5599999999995
like i wouldn't do that like if you're

4561.679 --> 4566.2390000000005
gonna say okay

4562.56 --> 4569.52
spiritual energy

4566.239 --> 4570.959999999999
like you could roughly say maybe claim

4569.52 --> 4573.120000000001
that

4570.96 --> 4574.159
in the spiritual dimension yeah the

4573.12 --> 4575.92
stars might be

4574.159 --> 4578.08
angels and they might actually get a

4575.92 --> 4579.4400000000005
personification and they might even do

4578.08 --> 4581.76
things

4579.44 --> 4584.0
out there it's just light it's just

4581.76 --> 4585.84
light

4584.0 --> 4587.36
and it's very special light it's unique

4585.84 --> 4589.1990000000005
light it's

4587.36 --> 4590.639999999999
light that's not actually coming from a

4589.199 --> 4595.199
specific origin point

4590.64 --> 4599.4400000000005
it's just manifest that's very special

4595.199 --> 4609.839999999999
we can't make that here so far

4599.44 --> 4609.839999999999
can't emulate that physically

4620.84 --> 4623.84
so

4643.73 --> 4647.978999999999
[Music]

4648.84 --> 4651.84
hmm

4652.44 --> 4658.2699999999995
[Music]

4662.84 --> 4665.84
um

4678.64 --> 4682.4800000000005
so pat v you got any more

4690.84 --> 4696.08
comments

4692.96 --> 4697.28
or is is that it saturn and venus look

4696.08 --> 4701.6
very different

4697.28 --> 4701.599999999999
yeah yeah they do

4702.56 --> 4707.84
does that prove what they are though

4708.88 --> 4714.400000000001
i mean where where is the confirmation

4711.76 --> 4716.2390000000005
of their physical nature

4714.4 --> 4718.719
where's the applying of perspective

4716.239 --> 4718.718999999999
where's the

4719.84 --> 4724.0
linear line of sight

4731.44 --> 4736.239
right you get closer it's supposed to

4734.4 --> 4738.08
stay in the same place because it's

4736.239 --> 4739.759999999999
literally there right it's a physical

4738.08 --> 4742.32
object that's there then so

4739.76 --> 4743.76
if you go in a straight line of sight

4742.32 --> 4747.5199999999995
you're supposed to actually

4743.76 --> 4749.12
get to it it becomes bigger because of

4747.52 --> 4752.2390000000005
perspective

4749.12 --> 4752.239
maybe just slowly

4752.48 --> 4760.48
there should be yeah it should not just

4755.52 --> 4762.4800000000005
disappear or bend out of the way

4760.48 --> 4764.799999999999
right because those things don't happen

4762.48 --> 4767.28
to actual objects that you see in the

4764.8 --> 4767.28
distance

4771.36 --> 4776.239
where's the confirmation of non-physical

4773.84 --> 4776.2390000000005
nature

4778.96 --> 4783.84
well i just explained that tiny wumble

4784.08 --> 4789.12
it's actually the other way around right

4786.96 --> 4790.08
if you want to claim it's physical then

4789.12 --> 4793.5199999999995
prove it

4790.08 --> 4793.5199999999995
so prove to me

4793.84 --> 4798.2390000000005
an increase in angular sights because of

4796.8 --> 4799.679
approach because of perspective

4798.239 --> 4802.639999999999
everything that's physical

4799.679 --> 4804.08
as a physical object perspective applies

4802.64 --> 4808.4800000000005
to it

4804.08 --> 4812.88
that's a fact it's a logical

4808.48 --> 4817.36
fact everything that's physical

4812.88 --> 4819.679
has perspective applied to it always

4817.36 --> 4820.5599999999995
it's a physical thing and if you

4819.679 --> 4822.8
approach it

4820.56 --> 4823.679
the angular size to the observer becomes

4822.8 --> 4825.92
bigger

4823.679 --> 4827.4400000000005
if you go away from it it becomes

4825.92 --> 4830.4
smaller

4827.44 --> 4832.0
and as something moves away as it

4830.4 --> 4835.28
becomes smaller moving into the

4832.0 --> 4838.08
distance it also slows down

4835.28 --> 4838.08
apparently

4839.28 --> 4843.199
just as when it approaches you

4843.28 --> 4848.4
it will seem to quicken up and then as

4846.32 --> 4849.44
something like a car whatever moves

4848.4 --> 4851.5199999999995
right past you

4849.44 --> 4852.719
suddenly there's a huge amount of

4851.52 --> 4856.080000000001
angular

4852.719 --> 4858.88
change happening visually because it's

4856.08 --> 4858.88
very close

4859.76 --> 4862.88
but as it is going way in the distance

4861.84 --> 4865.28
yeah then

4862.88 --> 4867.84
the amount is actually deviating starts

4865.28 --> 4871.28
to slow down and slow down and slow down

4867.84 --> 4874.0
and that's all because it is physical

4871.28 --> 4874.8
and it has the laws of perspective apply

4874.0 --> 4877.92
to it

4874.8 --> 4879.4400000000005
that's proof it's a physical thing you

4877.92 --> 4883.1990000000005
can approach it it becomes

4879.44 --> 4883.199
bigger to the observer

4884.639 --> 4888.159000000001
all these things that those are the

4886.4 --> 4889.679
things that actually prove a physical

4888.159 --> 4892.48
nature so

4889.679 --> 4892.88
because there's a complete lack of this

4892.48 --> 4896.48
in

4892.88 --> 4900.2390000000005
all senses in all senses of every

4896.48 --> 4902.159
heavenly body i'm just going to say nope

4900.239 --> 4904.239
you don't have any evidence they are

4902.159 --> 4906.96
physical

4904.239 --> 4909.199
even though you can't then compare it

4906.96 --> 4911.199
with something else very conveniently

4909.199 --> 4915.04
say oh it must be that

4911.199 --> 4916.0
right no you don't get a very convenient

4915.04 --> 4918.48
alternative this

4916.0 --> 4919.12
is about establishing what is real not

4918.48 --> 4922.239
about

4919.12 --> 4924.5599999999995
giving you a nice toy to play with

4922.239 --> 4927.12
in your imagination this is about

4924.56 --> 4931.76
figuring out what is real

4927.12 --> 4934.159
not convenience for your imagination

4931.76 --> 4934.8
so if it's physical then prove it's

4934.159 --> 4945.839999999999
physical

4934.8 --> 4945.84
show that perspective applies

4956.84 --> 4959.84
um

4961.44 --> 4968.32
it wasn't somebody fired a plastic band

4966.0 --> 4970.639
on the planetarium projector and it

4968.32 --> 4970.639
broke

4971.199 --> 4975.12
that's that's a silly story man ready

4973.84 --> 4977.52
medical

4975.12 --> 4977.5199999999995
crow

4982.48 --> 4987.839999999999
hey good morning by the way julie of

4984.84 --> 4987.84
heaven

5006.72 --> 5009.859
[Music]

5029.12 --> 5034.96
all right look pat

5032.32 --> 5036.719
you call it a burden of proof reversal

5034.96 --> 5038.159
right

5036.719 --> 5039.84
but i'm supposed to prove it's

5038.159 --> 5041.599999999999
holographic

5039.84 --> 5044.32
how do you prove something is

5041.6 --> 5048.159000000001
exclusively light based if you can't

5044.32 --> 5050.5599999999995
very manipulate its presence

5048.159 --> 5053.44
other than blot blotting it out from

5050.56 --> 5053.4400000000005
your observation

5054.239 --> 5059.04
right unless you have direct control

5056.56 --> 5062.56
over the mechanism

5059.04 --> 5064.719
you can't prove it's light only

5062.56 --> 5066.88
but what you can do is every time

5064.719 --> 5069.36
somebody assumes it's physical

5066.88 --> 5070.08
then you automatically assume there is a

5069.36 --> 5072.639
physical

5070.08 --> 5074.32
specific location in space in relation

5072.639 --> 5077.679
to you

5074.32 --> 5079.599999999999
where it is now that can be proven or

5077.679 --> 5081.52
disproven let's approach it

5079.6 --> 5082.639
let's go there let's see if perspective

5081.52 --> 5086.96
applies right

5082.639 --> 5086.96
i'm just trying to be real here

5088.4 --> 5094.239
because i cannot scientifically prove

5091.52 --> 5095.52
it's holographic i can only point at the

5094.239 --> 5099.04
complete and utter

5095.52 --> 5102.400000000001
lack of evidence of the physical nature

5099.04 --> 5102.4
that's the only thing i can do

5103.92 --> 5107.84
right and then follow a logical

5107.04 --> 5110.239
alternative

5107.84 --> 5111.1990000000005
right holographic light based well

5110.239 --> 5113.199
there's light

5111.199 --> 5114.638999999999
and there's also light arriving here on

5113.199 --> 5118.32
earth

5114.639 --> 5121.6
so yeah what alternative do i have

5118.32 --> 5124.0
with complete lack of physicality

5121.6 --> 5125.360000000001
what alternative do i have besides

5124.0 --> 5129.92
calling it holographic

5125.36 --> 5129.92
you tell me right

5131.28 --> 5135.599999999999
i didn't just choose the word

5133.28 --> 5137.44
holographic because i thought it sounded

5135.6 --> 5140.56
cool and science fictiony no

5137.44 --> 5142.08
i i called it that because of the actual

5140.56 --> 5146.8
meaning of the word

5142.08 --> 5146.8
holographic light image

5146.96 --> 5152.08
that's it i'm just trying to be very

5152.84 --> 5155.84
literal

5161.01 --> 5164.069
[Music]

5166.84 --> 5171.28
um

5169.12 --> 5173.12
there's no way to establish the true

5171.28 --> 5176.32
nature of saturn and the other planet

5173.12 --> 5176.32
light sources really

5176.88 --> 5181.4400000000005
well if they'd actually be physical

5179.52 --> 5184.56
balls in outer space

5181.44 --> 5185.36
yeah they would there would absolutely

5184.56 --> 5188.400000000001
be

5185.36 --> 5191.5199999999995
ways to establish

5188.4 --> 5191.92
what they are right don't you understand

5191.52 --> 5193.4400000000005
that

5191.92 --> 5195.36
if you're going to claim something is

5193.44 --> 5197.599999999999
physical

5195.36 --> 5198.5599999999995
then yeah there's a lot that comes with

5197.6 --> 5200.2390000000005
that claim

5198.56 --> 5202.080000000001
oh you claim it's physical okay well

5200.239 --> 5203.678999999999
let's see the laws of perspective apply

5202.08 --> 5211.84
let's see you approach it let's see you

5203.679 --> 5211.84
touch it

5224.48 --> 5229.36
am i claiming it's physical yes pat v

5227.36 --> 5231.759999999999
yes you are

5229.36 --> 5234.159
yeah you are you were you were doing

5231.76 --> 5239.84
just that in chat

5234.159 --> 5239.839999999999
do i need to scroll back

5241.92 --> 5245.6
let me see why did you say that

5246.32 --> 5253.84
jumped in pretty late

5264.08 --> 5281.04
oh wait no now you actually kind of went

5266.8 --> 5285.04
halfway neutral with that

5281.04 --> 5288.96
hmm okay no yeah you're right

5285.04 --> 5292.32
you didn't actually say that all right

5288.96 --> 5295.28
i take it back but there seems to be a

5292.32 --> 5297.28
suggestion though

5295.28 --> 5299.5199999999995
i guess you're just wasting everybody's

5297.28 --> 5299.5199999999995
time

5299.6 --> 5303.679
maybe you were fishing for fallacies

5301.92 --> 5304.4
without actually having the balls to

5303.679 --> 5308.719
even

5304.4 --> 5312.879999999999
have a claim

5308.719 --> 5315.199
is that it you're just trying to

5312.88 --> 5316.56
trying to make me create fallacies in

5315.199 --> 5318.638999999999
the moment is that it

5316.56 --> 5323.84
because you don't claim anything so you

5318.639 --> 5323.84
don't claim a heliocentric model

5326.08 --> 5331.28
are you conceding the heliocentric model

5329.12 --> 5333.04
is not real because yeah

5331.28 --> 5335.04
integral to that claim of the

5333.04 --> 5337.76
heliocentric model is that

5335.04 --> 5339.12
the planets are physical including the

5337.76 --> 5340.719
moon

5339.12 --> 5343.199
right they're physical in literal

5340.719 --> 5345.44
positions that kind of comes

5343.199 --> 5348.159
with the heliocentric model i don't know

5345.44 --> 5351.839999999999
if you realize this pathfi

5348.159 --> 5351.839999999999
do you know that

5370.32 --> 5375.28
something yeah i can by the way dispel

5373.92 --> 5377.1990000000005
that

5375.28 --> 5378.32
reflection what you said like what

5377.199 --> 5380.48
reflection

5378.32 --> 5381.84
something's reflecting no i don't think

5380.48 --> 5384.799999999999
so

5381.84 --> 5386.719
you don't have proof of anything any

5384.8 --> 5391.4400000000005
reflection

5386.719 --> 5394.96
object right objects reflect

5391.44 --> 5397.199
transparent nothing does not reflect so

5394.96 --> 5400.0
there has to be something actually then

5397.199 --> 5402.159
reflecting if you're going to say

5400.0 --> 5403.28
something is reflecting it back to my

5402.159 --> 5406.719
telescope

5403.28 --> 5408.719
no no what i claim

5406.719 --> 5410.0
and i can claim it i'd love somebody to

5408.719 --> 5413.04
disprove me right i

5410.0 --> 5415.84
love it please do so if you can

5413.04 --> 5417.84
what i claim is it's light manifest it's

5415.84 --> 5419.28
not reflecting from anything it's not

5417.84 --> 5423.1990000000005
emanating from anything

5419.28 --> 5425.84
it's simply energy working its way

5423.199 --> 5426.638999999999
the way it was designed within the realm

5425.84 --> 5430.8
and there is

5426.639 --> 5435.04
light manifesting and actually i

5430.8 --> 5438.320000000001
willing to even step it up and say that

5435.04 --> 5439.199
the more air pressure the more

5438.32 --> 5442.4
atmosphere

5439.199 --> 5446.239
is present the more

5442.4 --> 5448.239
the light manifests there

5446.239 --> 5450.5599999999995
unless it's completely physically

5448.239 --> 5454.799999999999
blocked

5450.56 --> 5454.8
right there's more light

5455.92 --> 5461.04
the closer to the earth than there is

5458.719 --> 5464.8
even above it

5461.04 --> 5467.28
there's still some light like the sun's

5464.8 --> 5469.679
the apparent sun the direction of the

5467.28 --> 5472.239
daylight of the sunlight

5469.679 --> 5473.6
there's still manifestation of it higher

5472.239 --> 5476.718999999999
up

5473.6 --> 5480.400000000001
but there seems to be overall more of it

5476.719 --> 5483.84
down here which leads me to believe

5480.4 --> 5486.719
that it's literally just light

5483.84 --> 5487.679
manifesting it's just like out of

5486.719 --> 5490.96
nowhere

5487.679 --> 5494.0
it just arrives

5490.96 --> 5496.8
just arrives and is absorbed that's

5494.0 --> 5496.8
how i see it

5498.159 --> 5504.159
does light need a source well celestial

5500.56 --> 5506.96
light doesn't

5504.159 --> 5508.239
it's there there's no source that you

5506.96 --> 5511.199
can prove

5508.239 --> 5511.759999999999
the only thing it requires is energy so

5511.199 --> 5515.199
there is

5511.76 --> 5517.52
energy somehow probably electric

5515.199 --> 5518.799999999999
feeding into the manifestation of the

5517.52 --> 5521.679
daylight

5518.8 --> 5523.1990000000005
and the celestial lights all of it but

5521.679 --> 5528.2390000000005
it's not coming from a source

5523.199 --> 5533.839999999999
it's just manifesting just like that

5528.239 --> 5533.839999999999
very mysterious

5535.92 --> 5543.52
all right so grendel yes when we

5539.6 --> 5545.92
make light through technology

5543.52 --> 5546.56
through even a fire here on earth with

5545.92 --> 5549.36
matter

5546.56 --> 5552.320000000001
when we make light with matter yes it

5549.36 --> 5556.239
requires a source

5552.32 --> 5558.96
celestial lights nope

5556.239 --> 5560.879999999999
doesn't seem to have one it's just

5558.96 --> 5563.92
manifesting

5560.88 --> 5567.1990000000005
weird isn't it isn't that just surreal

5563.92 --> 5567.1990000000005
isn't that just surreal

5569.36 --> 5574.48
well i don't think you can prove that

5572.32 --> 5578.32
it's not real

5574.48 --> 5581.678999999999
you can't prove something that disproves

5578.32 --> 5585.599999999999
my setup you

5581.679 --> 5586.159
yeah because what alternative do you

5585.6 --> 5588.8
have

5586.159 --> 5590.32
what if you don't if you can pinpoint

5588.8 --> 5592.96
the source of this light

5590.32 --> 5595.599999999999
it's still there oh does that mean you

5592.96 --> 5598.08
just have to stop thinking about it

5595.6 --> 5599.52
no but there is light manifesting so

5598.08 --> 5602.0
yeah let's just get honest

5599.52 --> 5602.96
it's not coming from a source it's just

5602.0 --> 5606.0
manifesting

5602.96 --> 5606.639
it's a natural thing i call it celestial

5606.0 --> 5609.92
light

5606.639 --> 5613.28
that's why i absolutely compartmentalize

5609.92 --> 5614.159
light between earthly light created

5613.28 --> 5617.44
through matter

5614.159 --> 5618.32
bios electricity heat however you want

5617.44 --> 5622.199
to call that

5618.32 --> 5624.639
and celestialite coming from the heavens

5622.199 --> 5625.919999999999
non-local light not coming from a

5624.639 --> 5629.679
specific point

5625.92 --> 5632.56
very mysterious we don't understand

5629.679 --> 5633.6
how it works i don't understand how it

5632.56 --> 5636.0
works

5633.6 --> 5638.2390000000005
yeah and that's not because oh i didn't

5636.0 --> 5640.639
i just didn't understand

5638.239 --> 5641.36
the literature oh it makes no sense you

5640.639 --> 5643.84
have to

5641.36 --> 5646.159
discard it if it doesn't make sense

5643.84 --> 5648.639
according to the established

5646.159 --> 5649.759999999999
structural hierarchy of how we approach

5648.639 --> 5653.36
things

5649.76 --> 5656.4800000000005
yeah no no

5653.36 --> 5659.839999999999
there's just the evidence is missing so

5656.48 --> 5659.839999999999
this is how i see it

5663.6 --> 5668.88
well grendel stars seem to produce light

5666.32 --> 5671.599999999999
really so what is a star

5668.88 --> 5673.04
you mean the lights blinking and then

5671.6 --> 5674.8
when you go up really high

5673.04 --> 5676.96
suddenly there's no more lights blinking

5674.8 --> 5680.159000000001
it's just gone

5676.96 --> 5682.2390000000005
those stars right it's just light

5680.159 --> 5686.08
manifest it's just

5682.239 --> 5688.0
something you see

5686.08 --> 5690.719
you can't approach it it doesn't

5688.0 --> 5694.4
increase in angular size

5690.719 --> 5698.32
it doesn't correlate with a physical

5694.4 --> 5700.638999999999
light source as we could produce it here

5698.32 --> 5703.92
on earth

5700.639 --> 5703.92
it doesn't correlate at all

5704.159 --> 5707.239
like how about the inverse square law oh

5706.32 --> 5709.759999999999
yeah then it

5707.239 --> 5711.36
absolutely makes no sense anymore

5709.76 --> 5714.8
whatsoever

5711.36 --> 5717.5199999999995
right yeah because it's not coming from

5714.8 --> 5720.320000000001
physical objects

5717.52 --> 5722.56
that's physical assumption bias

5720.32 --> 5725.599999999999
programmed into you

5722.56 --> 5728.8
through generations

5725.6 --> 5731.679
of indoctrination and visuals beautiful

5728.8 --> 5734.4800000000005
paintings for you to latch onto

5731.679 --> 5736.639
and develop physicality assumption bias

5734.48 --> 5743.839999999999
because of it

5736.639 --> 5743.84
that's where that's coming from

5754.84 --> 5757.84
okay

5768.84 --> 5771.84
hmm

5777.84 --> 5780.159000000001
what

5781.52 --> 5786.4800000000005
there is electric plasma arc lightning

5784.48 --> 5789.04
what

5786.48 --> 5791.28
no no actually that's not the type of

5789.04 --> 5793.44
light manifestation that i was referring

5791.28 --> 5793.44
to

5794.08 --> 5798.8
no it's literally a hologram side effect

5796.8 --> 5802.719
those things that we appear

5798.8 --> 5802.719
that appear to observers

5803.92 --> 5809.92
they're not when i say non-physical i

5807.84 --> 5811.6
literally mean non-physical that doesn't

5809.92 --> 5814.56
mean an object

5811.6 --> 5816.2390000000005
radiating heat based light or something

5814.56 --> 5818.400000000001
that it's not that no it

5816.239 --> 5820.239
means there is literally no light coming

5818.4 --> 5822.48
from a specific position

5820.239 --> 5824.879999999999
that's what that means it's a hologram

5822.48 --> 5827.5199999999995
it just appears

5824.88 --> 5828.4800000000005
to be there and there appears to be

5827.52 --> 5832.0
light coming

5828.48 --> 5833.919999999999
from there but it's not literally coming

5832.0 --> 5836.639
from a literal source

5833.92 --> 5838.84
that is specifically physically there

5836.639 --> 5840.32
that's the point it's literally like a

5838.84 --> 5843.1990000000005
hologram like

5840.32 --> 5843.84
not really there it just appears to be

5843.199 --> 5846.799999999999
there

5843.84 --> 5846.8
to an observer

5847.36 --> 5852.0
yeah and it gets really weird i know but

5850.239 --> 5854.32
what about shadows

5852.0 --> 5856.4
a specific object in front of the sun

5854.32 --> 5857.36
will block the sunlight you can deduce

5856.4 --> 5859.679
from the rays

5857.36 --> 5860.719
exactly where it should be but guess

5859.679 --> 5864.719
what you go there

5860.719 --> 5869.84
oh it's not there it's not there yay

5864.719 --> 5869.84
mind-blowing mystery i know

5880.159 --> 5883.759999999999
what do i think photographs of galaxies

5882.4 --> 5887.04
and nebulae

5883.76 --> 5887.04
actually are i don't know

5887.28 --> 5892.08
it could be several things it could be

5889.679 --> 5894.96
that there is like a fractal pattern

5892.08 --> 5897.119
to the celestial lights that reach

5894.96 --> 5899.6
beyond our superficial

5897.119 --> 5901.36
site of stars right it might literally

5899.6 --> 5904.56
be a giant fractal

5901.36 --> 5905.28
holographic pattern and that there may

5904.56 --> 5908.159000000001
be

5905.28 --> 5910.0
indeed what seemed to be like galaxies

5908.159 --> 5913.839999999999
and nebulae those visuals might

5910.0 --> 5915.6
be perceived right if you have a strong

5913.84 --> 5917.52
enough eye it might be a part

5915.6 --> 5918.96
of the whole holographic lobe of the

5917.52 --> 5922.0
heaven system

5918.96 --> 5925.119
or as an alternative

5922.0 --> 5929.28
it might be completely rendered

5925.119 --> 5930.4
cgi fiction like they figured out the

5929.28 --> 5932.639
pattern of the

5930.4 --> 5934.48
light manifestations as they have been

5932.639 --> 5937.679
visualized and then they

5934.48 --> 5940.48
like rendered it further

5937.679 --> 5942.639
they took a pattern a fractal pattern

5940.48 --> 5942.959999999999
that correlated perfectly with it and

5942.639 --> 5945.04
then

5942.96 --> 5947.04
started to proceed to basically dig

5945.04 --> 5949.679
deeper to get

5947.04 --> 5951.5199999999995
like an imaginary version that would

5949.679 --> 5953.36
happen if you zoom in when in reality

5951.52 --> 5955.360000000001
you can't zoom in any further right

5953.36 --> 5957.92
they might have overlaid something on

5955.36 --> 5960.239
there and that way

5957.92 --> 5960.96
gave you all these visuals of these

5960.239 --> 5964.32
super far

5960.96 --> 5967.52
distant galaxies as they call it so that

5964.32 --> 5968.32
might be a natural depth that you will

5967.52 --> 5970.400000000001
see that

5968.32 --> 5972.239
just as part of the mysterious globe of

5970.4 --> 5975.5199999999995
the heavens fractal pattern

5972.239 --> 5978.638999999999
or it might actually be artists

5975.52 --> 5981.52
interpretation based on a fractal system

5978.639 --> 5982.2390000000005
that has been designed specifically to

5981.52 --> 5984.96
deepen

5982.239 --> 5985.759999999999
further the sites when in reality

5984.96 --> 5989.44
there's no

5985.76 --> 5991.6
possibility to do that right

5989.44 --> 5995.839999999999
can be both i don't know for sure which

5991.6 --> 5995.84
one it is

6004.0 --> 6009.84
a weird software's a certain got to do

6006.32 --> 6009.84
with it

6024.4 --> 6030.5599999999995
what the [ __ ]

6027.44 --> 6031.36
uh come on guys what the hell does cern

6030.56 --> 6034.719
have to do with

6031.36 --> 6036.799999999999
anything of that yeah there's been weird

6034.719 --> 6037.76
rituals attention grabbiness i think

6036.8 --> 6041.04
that cern is

6037.76 --> 6042.88
literally a giant scam

6041.04 --> 6045.5199999999995
or that's what it's become it might have

6042.88 --> 6048.639
been an original test

6045.52 --> 6050.0
but even prior to building that thing

6048.639 --> 6052.4800000000005
they probably already

6050.0 --> 6053.679
got all the knowledge they really needed

6052.48 --> 6057.36
and they just

6053.679 --> 6059.52
thought like no let's milk this

6057.36 --> 6061.199
let's see how far we can grab all this

6059.52 --> 6063.76
thing

6061.199 --> 6065.678999999999
it's literally doing nothing it's just a

6063.76 --> 6068.400000000001
giant stupid magnet

6065.679 --> 6069.4400000000005
it doesn't do anything literally it

6068.4 --> 6073.199
doesn't do

6069.44 --> 6075.199
anything right oh yeah sure they might

6073.199 --> 6075.678999999999
technically be able to shoot particles

6075.199 --> 6078.4
and then

6075.679 --> 6079.28
bang it into other particles and then

6078.4 --> 6080.879999999999
they can

6079.28 --> 6082.48
look at the screen and look at all the

6080.88 --> 6084.719
scribbly lines and then

6082.48 --> 6086.4
interpret it like divination what that's

6084.719 --> 6088.56
all supposed to mean according to

6086.4 --> 6093.199
fractal patterns and

6088.56 --> 6096.320000000001
yeah it doesn't do anything

6093.199 --> 6099.44
if if you can point or describe

6096.32 --> 6101.599999999999
how anything productive anything

6099.44 --> 6106.638999999999
productive technology-wise that

6101.6 --> 6109.6
doesn't yeah that does not specifically

6106.639 --> 6112.159000000001
yield some kind of astronomy thing if

6109.6 --> 6114.08
anything productive technology-wise here

6112.159 --> 6116.0
on earth has ever been created

6114.08 --> 6117.119
through hydrogen collider experiments

6116.0 --> 6119.28
please let me know

6117.119 --> 6121.04
because as far as i know only

6119.28 --> 6123.679
theoretical garbage

6121.04 --> 6126.0
has come out of that only theoretical

6123.679 --> 6128.32
garbage

6126.0 --> 6129.44
so but hey you might prove me wrong if

6128.32 --> 6131.5199999999995
you can

6129.44 --> 6133.36
provide the evidence that anything

6131.52 --> 6135.280000000001
physically productive

6133.36 --> 6137.199
here on earth has ever come out of the

6135.28 --> 6138.0
hydrant collider i'd like to know about

6137.199 --> 6141.36
it

6138.0 --> 6141.36
and analyze that data

6142.32 --> 6146.96
because as far as i know it's only

6145.4 --> 6149.759999999999
astrophysical

6146.96 --> 6150.32
heliocentric garbage that's come out of

6149.76 --> 6163.84
that

6150.32 --> 6163.84
only that

6164.0 --> 6176.4
yeah huge money sucking magnet yeah

6165.76 --> 6178.8
that's a good way to describe it

6176.4 --> 6181.199
and who knows man maybe they tried to

6178.8 --> 6183.679
use those giant magnets to basically

6181.199 --> 6184.879999999999
influence the magnetism on earth right

6183.679 --> 6188.08
they might have just done

6184.88 --> 6189.84
giant magnetic experiments with it

6188.08 --> 6191.84
just to [ __ ] around see what would

6189.84 --> 6193.679
happen how nature would respond

6191.84 --> 6195.76
yeah they might have done that because

6193.679 --> 6198.639
hey whatever it's supposed to do

6195.76 --> 6199.360000000001
it's still the biggest freaking magnet

6198.639 --> 6202.56
ever built

6199.36 --> 6204.639
pretty much right

6202.56 --> 6206.080000000001
that is what it is and hey magnetism

6204.639 --> 6208.2390000000005
does have influence

6206.08 --> 6210.08
also on nature on all kinds of things it

6208.239 --> 6212.4
has influence so

6210.08 --> 6214.0
not saying that it's never had any kind

6212.4 --> 6216.0
of negative influence

6214.0 --> 6218.08
or that they did other things than just

6216.0 --> 6221.28
the supposed particle acceleration

6218.08 --> 6222.639
with it right we might have had a lot of

6221.28 --> 6224.96
dark side effects

6222.639 --> 6227.28
or just [ __ ] around to see what would

6224.96 --> 6227.28
happen

6227.52 --> 6232.159000000001
but as when it comes to really

6230.4 --> 6236.0
technological development

6232.159 --> 6238.08
coming out of the hydrant collider

6236.0 --> 6239.679
out of what they do there the particles

6238.08 --> 6241.36
bumping into one another and then

6239.679 --> 6243.52
looking at the scribbly lines and

6241.36 --> 6247.199
dividing what that's supposed to mean

6243.52 --> 6250.159000000001
through math if you can point at a

6247.199 --> 6250.5599999999995
single thing that's actually come out of

6250.159 --> 6252.879999999999
that

6250.56 --> 6261.84
outside of theoretics i'd like to know

6252.88 --> 6261.84
about it

6283.84 --> 6289.84
cinco drum what

6293.92 --> 6299.04
right i think i'm gonna round out the

6295.36 --> 6299.04
show it's been pretty good

6299.679 --> 6303.84
news to me i will look into it

6310.32 --> 6314.119
so there's another particle accelerator

6313.04 --> 6319.28
thingy in

6314.119 --> 6319.28
saskatoon george sanford really okay

6321.36 --> 6324.96
i think their goal is to do fundamental

6323.76 --> 6328.719
science and not

6324.96 --> 6328.719
necessarily develop technology

6328.84 --> 6331.84
uh

6332.88 --> 6337.28
well what use is it then if it's just

6335.84 --> 6339.360000000001
theoretical garbage

6337.28 --> 6340.4
coming out of it that doesn't actually

6339.36 --> 6343.599999999999
do anything or

6340.4 --> 6344.239
improve anything then why do it it's

6343.6 --> 6347.4400000000005
just

6344.239 --> 6347.44
a waste of time then

6348.32 --> 6352.639
like what kind of fundamental science

6350.96 --> 6354.159
are you gonna get

6352.639 --> 6356.88
it's not even science by the way if you

6354.159 --> 6358.32
don't have any physical empirical thing

6356.88 --> 6360.96
well what are you even going to get out

6358.32 --> 6366.32
of that if it doesn't reveal

6360.96 --> 6366.32
anything about the practical reality

6366.639 --> 6374.96
right that makes no sense tis i

6369.76 --> 6376.96
the count anyway rounding out the show

6374.96 --> 6379.199
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6376.96 --> 6382.4
liked the show i thought it was good

6379.199 --> 6382.4
some good discussions

6382.96 --> 6386.719
it's interesting it was good to talk

6385.119 --> 6388.799999999999
about the holographic

6386.719 --> 6389.76
globe of the heavens and the arguments

6388.8 --> 6394.159000000001
surrounding all that

6389.76 --> 6394.159000000001
and my claim and why i do that

6394.48 --> 6398.48
if you like this show too then please

6441.52 --> 6445.52
it's all the data is in the description

6443.76 --> 6447.6
box below

6445.52 --> 6451.679
right i will be back tomorrow with flat

6447.6 --> 6454.2390000000005
earth early bird number 879

6451.679 --> 6455.76
the friday edition should be good and

6454.239 --> 6457.5199999999995
i'm going to join the flat earth debates

6455.76 --> 6459.04
which should start up in a few minutes

6457.52 --> 6462.88
from now

6459.04 --> 6466.88
and yeah good servant hashtag mifa

6462.88 --> 6471.84
indeed make earth flat again

6466.88 --> 6471.84
make earth 3 again

6472.32 --> 6483.86
and yeah until the next video

6475.679 --> 6510.609
keep it flat

6483.86 --> 6510.6089999999995
[Music]

6529.28 --> 6531.36
you
