and there's wind this time today

104.64 --> 109.28
started around in the night

109.5 --> 115.28
see some clouds rushing by

112.56 --> 115.28
up there

119.04 --> 123.659
it looks a bit wet out there too I

121.68 --> 125.34
haven't really seen any rain coming out

123.659 --> 127.32000000000001
but

125.34 --> 129.979
yeah that might have been some clouds

127.32 --> 129.97899999999998
that dropped some

130.86 --> 136.28
but yeah it's especially just more windy

134.04 --> 136.28
today

138.62 --> 141.68
all right

144.48 --> 146.48
um

146.94 --> 149.94
hello

150.019 --> 157.22
Kepler first in chat Crockett flattered

153.72 --> 157.22
Sage good to see you

158.22 --> 165.84
it is Thursday the 27th of January 2022

168.36 --> 171.37900000000002
Smurf y'all

178.379 --> 183.79999999999998
right so yeah I have no idea what I'm

180.9 --> 183.8
gonna talk about today

183.84 --> 190.64000000000001
also yeah I did go to bed

187.08 --> 190.64000000000001
a bit late

190.98 --> 197.459
and like I just had yeah I took a shower

194.819 --> 199.379
that's why I'm all fluffy I did take a

197.459 --> 202.81900000000002
shower before going to bed

199.379 --> 202.819
now that fluffy hair

205.86 --> 209.65900000000002
I didn't need that shower though

211.319 --> 217.819
Jeff gas head

213.42 --> 217.819
slow-mo moon buggy good to see you

218.519 --> 220.70000000000002
foreign

222.78 --> 230.12
so yeah yesterday on the Flyers debates

226.379 --> 230.12
I was pretty energetic

230.22 --> 234.42
and yeah so were the rest of the guys so

232.26 --> 237.26
yeah it turned into a very long after

234.42 --> 237.26
show also

237.659 --> 240.439
a pretty good one

240.9 --> 243.56
uh

244.08 --> 249.799
so yeah I am looking forward to seeing

246.54 --> 249.79899999999998
that back in the premiere

251.28 --> 254.18
ah

260.639 --> 266.72
all right yeah before this I was kind of

262.919 --> 266.71999999999997
finishing up watching oh Benjamin

268.44 --> 273.44
as yeah

270.419 --> 273.44
just hilarious

273.84 --> 280.15999999999997
but that was from Tuesday's show I

276.06 --> 280.16
haven't watched Wednesdays yet

287.46 --> 290.9
looking forward to that

298.38 --> 300.86
is

306.85 --> 310.029
[Music]

318.0 --> 322.44
all right yeah yeah I noticed by the way

320.46 --> 324.78
Eric Dubai uploaded another video The

322.44 --> 327.0
Dauntless astronomy

324.78 --> 328.02
and like first half of it was pretty

327.0 --> 331.699
good

328.02 --> 335.039
and then he just started to insert

331.699 --> 337.91900000000004
basically disk Earth again

335.039 --> 340.38
like oh we all know it's the same and

337.919 --> 343.62
well now it's done it's a Disney since

340.38 --> 345.71999999999997
blah blah like come on after everything

343.62 --> 347.58
that it was talked about in the first

345.72 --> 349.97900000000004
half

347.58 --> 352.25899999999996
and then Eric just starts to assert his

349.979 --> 354.36
disc beliefs basically

352.259 --> 357.0
afterward and yeah it's kind of

354.36 --> 359.819
embarrassing at this point to do that is

357.0 --> 363.06
kind of embarrassing

359.819 --> 365.639
and a waste because the rest

363.06 --> 368.88
like if we just leave that

365.639 --> 371.039
out or at least not say it like that

368.88 --> 372.3
like yeah there we just say like there's

371.039 --> 375.18
a

372.3 --> 377.759
good chance and mathematically it works

375.18 --> 379.74
out if you start to assume the Earth is

377.759 --> 382.44
a flat disc

379.74 --> 385.44
it might not be but yeah

382.44 --> 388.319
it's still very compelling

385.44 --> 391.08
right if you just say it like that

388.319 --> 394.97900000000004
that would fix so much

391.08 --> 397.34
but it just keeps saying it in the 2015

394.979 --> 397.34
way

398.52 --> 401.65999999999997
what a waste

422.099 --> 426.0
yeah yeah the legend of the Smurf is

424.44 --> 429.259
also spreading

426.0 --> 432.599
think I've managed to

429.259 --> 437.06
infect some Flat Earth debaters

432.599 --> 437.06
that now sometimes bring it up to

437.22 --> 440.41900000000004
so that's pretty fun

447.02 --> 452.34
yeah but don't worry I I was never

449.639 --> 453.599
planning to just constantly talk about

452.34 --> 455.63899999999995
Smurfs

453.599 --> 458.4
all the time

455.639 --> 460.86
I mean it gets kind of tiresome but

458.4 --> 463.44
that's also the point so I'm not gonna

460.86 --> 465.12
make it more tiresome than it needs to

463.44 --> 467.16
be

465.12 --> 469.699
uh-huh

467.16 --> 469.699
right

472.86 --> 478.56
a new one would catch yeah

475.62 --> 482.72
I was fairly certain it would

478.56 --> 482.72
because the connections are just too

482.759 --> 488.22
too profound

485.46 --> 492.0
if you start comparing it to how science

488.22 --> 495.24
is used it just works too well

492.0 --> 498.84
I wonder then also like

495.24 --> 500.699
were the Smurfs even kind of like

498.84 --> 502.44
based

500.699 --> 503.94
on that idea

502.44 --> 505.86
because they're presented like oh

503.94 --> 507.3
they're all so nice and they're the good

505.86 --> 510.47900000000004
guys but

507.3 --> 514.74
they're also kind of stupid

510.479 --> 517.68
so I wonder if like the maker of it

514.74 --> 520.74
was basically putting a criticism on

517.68 --> 522.0
society by comparing them to Smurfs so

520.74 --> 525.54
maybe

522.0 --> 526.98
even my comparison of science with Smurf

525.54 --> 530.16
was

526.98 --> 533.16
inside of the heart at the time

530.16 --> 535.74
of the maker of the Smurfs

533.16 --> 537.92
it's just an idea maybe he did maybe he

535.74 --> 537.92
does

538.08 --> 540.62
you know

553.08 --> 557.4590000000001
found another video too right yeah yeah

555.42 --> 559.0799999999999
now remember I did also watch that

557.459 --> 561.06
channel

559.08 --> 562.98
now I remember again that's what I was

561.06 --> 564.66
watching the channel That was

562.98 --> 567.12
recommended to me yesterday I think

564.66 --> 571.62
space Busters

567.12 --> 574.7
wow I was kind of downplaying it like oh

571.62 --> 579.5
it's just another video but yeah damn

574.7 --> 579.5
that guy really knows

579.779 --> 586.019
how to put down a good explanation story

582.899 --> 590.279
he's a good narrator so I watched that

586.019 --> 592.32
video was very impressed then continued

590.279 --> 596.22
on his playlist on which you're

592.32 --> 598.8000000000001
basically watching two more full videos

596.22 --> 601.74
about Bill Gates

598.8 --> 603.0
and yeah it's just yeah it's a good

601.74 --> 606.74
Channel

603.0 --> 606.74
I was I was very impressed

608.22 --> 611.6
so thank you for that tip

644.459 --> 649.14
all right I'll link you guys up because

646.26 --> 651.12
it's a pretty good Channel

649.14 --> 653.36
for those that hadn't actually checked

651.12 --> 653.36
it out

660.54 --> 663.68
hello Kepler

665.399 --> 669.38
oh wait yeah you're already there uh

672.36 --> 676.86
watch a video and I could play it and

675.18 --> 680.899
critique it

676.86 --> 680.899
that's not really what I do though

683.459 --> 687.66
unless it's just something that's really

685.68 --> 691.1999999999999
funny

687.66 --> 693.42
but yeah I've never done videos like

691.2 --> 695.94
that oh it's just oh look somebody made

693.42 --> 698.16
something I'm gonna play it and then

695.94 --> 701.1800000000001
pause it and talk about it

698.16 --> 701.18
never done that

704.88 --> 710.82
don't think I really want to

707.88 --> 712.92
unless I was like super passionate about

710.82 --> 715.88
it something

712.92 --> 720.92
and I felt like it really needed

715.88 --> 720.92
detailed analysis like that

723.72 --> 730.4590000000001
yes space bus just did some real serious

727.86 --> 730.4590000000001
research

782.04 --> 787.4399999999999
right but yeah it is his video about

784.62 --> 789.54
Bill Gates secret bloodlines

787.44 --> 792.5400000000001
like damn

789.54 --> 796.019
he did some real serious genealogy

792.54 --> 798.959
digging and it's crazy again he is like

796.019 --> 803.7
one of those families or maybe like

798.959 --> 806.4799999999999
the most one of those families

803.7 --> 806.48
it's crazy

836.88 --> 839.42
right

843.36 --> 845.54
foreign

847.98 --> 855.6
but yeah overall Jeff Cass had

851.82 --> 858.4200000000001
I'm not like going after people that are

855.6 --> 860.519
talking nonsense about the sexton

858.42 --> 862.74
I mean I understand

860.519 --> 864.839
this accident by now

862.74 --> 867.24
I don't think I could just use it just

864.839 --> 870.3000000000001
with the sexton that still have to get

867.24 --> 872.82
some feedback on the details

870.3 --> 874.9799999999999
not saying I'm an operator but I do get

872.82 --> 876.9590000000001
it I do get the arguments from the

874.98 --> 880.6800000000001
flatter side

876.959 --> 882.959
that like the 10th man is figured out

880.68 --> 885.7199999999999
and and the rest

882.959 --> 888.66
so I'm not really going after like

885.72 --> 890.639
numpties and anti-flat earthers that are

888.66 --> 894.26
doing a sexting challenge because it's

890.639 --> 894.26
just not my thing like that

905.399 --> 910.5
I mean I'll take challenges based on

907.92 --> 912.0
physicality assumption bias about the

910.5 --> 913.44
celestials

912.0 --> 917.399
right

913.44 --> 919.74
because that's my expertise that's what

917.399 --> 922.279
I'm always chiseling on

919.74 --> 922.279
right

923.459 --> 927.4799999999999
like I don't need to do research for

925.92 --> 930.4799999999999
that

927.48 --> 932.22
because I I got it right here

930.48 --> 934.5600000000001
so I have my own

932.22 --> 936.899
type of specialties

934.56 --> 941.1199999999999
and I can debate people about it it's

936.899 --> 941.12
just nobody's really challenging it

948.6 --> 953.519
all right this might also be because

950.82 --> 958.6990000000001
everybody kind of outside of their reach

953.519 --> 958.699
is realizing that I was right all along

958.86 --> 963.48
and yeah you're not really gonna

960.72 --> 965.94
challenge something if you

963.48 --> 968.519
don't know how to

965.94 --> 970.259
prove or disprove it but you think I'm

968.519 --> 972.98
probably right

970.259 --> 972.98
so

988.079 --> 993.62
here is the link the link of what Jeff

991.019 --> 993.62
gas said

998.339 --> 1004.12
oh wait the one you wanted me to

1001.639 --> 1004.12
critique

1011.0 --> 1013.839
okay

1043.939 --> 1050.24
hmm okay oh the video link I flick

1048.319 --> 1054.58
through it for the

1050.24 --> 1054.58
video looked pretty decent

1059.94 --> 1062.989
[Music]

1082.16 --> 1088.64
why is there nothing in the middle of

1084.38 --> 1090.8600000000001
the Pentagon just an empty space uh

1088.64 --> 1093.7990000000002
well there's a lot of

1090.86 --> 1095.6599999999999
like wide buildings that are designed

1093.799 --> 1098.48
like that

1095.66 --> 1100.94
right building complexes that have like

1098.48 --> 1103.1200000000001
an inner Garden that's actually kind of

1100.94 --> 1103.1200000000001
normal

1110.059 --> 1112.299
foreign

1124.9 --> 1128.679
Forts and such what

1147.679 --> 1151.64
ah a really YouTube it says that that's

1150.44 --> 1154.52
hilarious

1151.64 --> 1157.3400000000001
oh it just happened to be the layout of

1154.52 --> 1159.46
the roads and that's why it's builted

1157.34 --> 1164.36
built like a

1159.46 --> 1164.3600000000001
Pentagon right sure

1166.64 --> 1172.22
then why were the roads laid out like

1168.74 --> 1172.22
that then right

1173.0 --> 1175.78
all right yeah

1175.86 --> 1179.9599999999998
[Music]

1177.679 --> 1182.6000000000001
That's funny though that when looking it

1179.96 --> 1185.98
up it actually says that as an excuse

1182.6 --> 1185.98
that's that's kind of funny

1186.38 --> 1188.5590000000002
foreign

1219.22 --> 1226.76
of the roads around the Pentagon then

1222.74 --> 1229.58
suggests is that even at the time when

1226.76 --> 1232.1589999999999
the basic layout of the region like the

1229.58 --> 1235.22
city infrastructure layout was being

1232.159 --> 1237.0200000000002
made it was always planned to have the

1235.22 --> 1239.48
Pentagon there

1237.02 --> 1242.299
that's the information you can very

1239.48 --> 1243.38
easily deduce from that

1242.299 --> 1245.78
right

1243.38 --> 1249.0200000000002
so it's not something oh yeah we just

1245.78 --> 1251.84
built that and at the last moment when

1249.02 --> 1254.9189999999999
we had to no no that was like planned

1251.84 --> 1254.9189999999999
way ahead of time

1274.1 --> 1281.1999999999998
built in 1941 well it could be I'm just

1277.34 --> 1281.1999999999998
saying that it was planned

1281.36 --> 1284.3799999999999
way back

1288.679 --> 1292.7
so

1290.299 --> 1295.28
where it stands it was always going to

1292.7 --> 1297.7
be this is like the place for a special

1295.28 --> 1297.7
building

1298.94 --> 1304.5800000000002
with five sides

1301.039 --> 1307.039
because of the the road layout so they

1304.58 --> 1308.48
always plan this is where a very special

1307.039 --> 1310.1
bill is going to be because they

1308.48 --> 1312.02
literally arrange the entire

1310.1 --> 1316.2199999999998
infrastructure

1312.02 --> 1318.1399999999999
of the city around it like that

1316.22 --> 1321.08
even though they might have built it

1318.14 --> 1323.1200000000001
much later it was always gonna be a

1321.08 --> 1324.1399999999999
special building there

1323.12 --> 1326.1789999999999
see

1324.14 --> 1329.5590000000002
that's not a hard conclusion to draw

1326.179 --> 1329.5590000000002
that's not overreaching

1337.36 --> 1340.53
[Music]

1372.5 --> 1376.7
right anyway

1374.32 --> 1380.8999999999999
uh man

1376.7 --> 1383.179
finally losing the muscle ache took long

1380.9 --> 1386.38
enough but yeah the shower did really do

1383.179 --> 1386.38
a good work on that

1407.6 --> 1412.8999999999999
it's almost as if they know things in

1409.88 --> 1412.9
aren't sharing no [ __ ]

1447.679 --> 1450.679
anyway

1451.22 --> 1453.88
right

1456.559 --> 1459.1589999999999
so

1462.32 --> 1468.039
what do you guys wanted me to talk about

1465.32 --> 1468.039
questions

1468.78 --> 1471.859
[Music]

1483.62 --> 1489.34
now what

1486.159 --> 1492.7600000000002
they use

1489.34 --> 1496.6399999999999
that's not very specific YouTube

1492.76 --> 1500.2
they use caved weather oh really I have

1496.64 --> 1500.2
no idea where you're talking about them

1513.62 --> 1520.299
do they really meet up in K in caves

1516.14 --> 1520.2990000000002
with capes and masks really

1520.82 --> 1524.26
are you sure about that

1528.86 --> 1533.6
oh you saw it in the village oh well

1531.62 --> 1535.6699999999998
that's not very good evidence that it

1533.6 --> 1538.7389999999998
actually happens

1535.67 --> 1538.739
[Music]

1548.12 --> 1555.5
all right oh hello flutter Sage my

1551.36 --> 1560.08
opinion on the Catholic church God

1555.5 --> 1560.08
there's a big subject

1564.08 --> 1572.3799999999999
yeah what do I think about it what yeah

1568.4 --> 1572.38
I think the Catholic church was

1572.72 --> 1577.9
yeah

1574.82 --> 1577.8999999999999
designed to

1580.34 --> 1586.4599999999998
basically take over Christianity which I

1583.52 --> 1589.34
think at the time was kind of a a

1586.46 --> 1591.74
Grassroots religion type of thing

1589.34 --> 1595.34
and they were there to

1591.74 --> 1598.1
turn it convert it into

1595.34 --> 1600.9189999999999
a priest hierarchical system that would

1598.1 --> 1603.9189999999999
later lead to a theocracy

1600.919 --> 1608.419
so they basically captured the teachings

1603.919 --> 1610.5800000000002
of Christ and then their priests made

1608.419 --> 1612.5590000000002
layers around it

1610.58 --> 1615.1999999999998
and then the people would get to hear

1612.559 --> 1618.9189999999999
about the layers but

1615.2 --> 1622.299
not actually about yeah about Jesus

1618.919 --> 1622.2990000000002
Christ himself too much

1624.14 --> 1628.2990000000002
and that's yeah that's how they

1628.52 --> 1633.32
basically pacified the entire Christian

1631.64 --> 1637.88
Movement

1633.32 --> 1637.8799999999999
in a way it still survived

1639.14 --> 1645.3200000000002
but they captured it

1643.039 --> 1648.76
they made everybody associate

1645.32 --> 1648.76
Christianity with them

1656.48 --> 1661.34
and yeah in a confusing way because

1658.82 --> 1663.58
they're constantly assert inserting

1661.34 --> 1666.5
their

1663.58 --> 1669.3799999999999
traditions that really have nothing to

1666.5 --> 1672.679
do with it and their ways of going about

1669.38 --> 1674.24
that that are kind of in opposition to

1672.679 --> 1676.8200000000002
Christ's teachings

1674.24 --> 1678.919
right and people don't realize that

1676.82 --> 1680.779
they're all thinking they're doing what

1678.919 --> 1682.7
Jesus wanted

1680.779 --> 1684.62
what they're supposed to do but they

1682.7 --> 1686.8990000000001
don't understand that that's kind of a

1684.62 --> 1689.6589999999999
trick

1686.899 --> 1691.6999999999998
or a lot of them do I mean in these days

1689.659 --> 1694.46
of course it's no longer a theocracy

1691.7 --> 1696.38
days like like it used to be people now

1694.46 --> 1698.48
have their own Bible and they can like

1696.38 --> 1700.7
get all their Bibles and they can figure

1698.48 --> 1702.799
it out themselves

1700.7 --> 1705.0800000000002
that's why a lot of people

1702.799 --> 1707.12
they consider them Catholics themselves

1705.08 --> 1709.22
Catholics are very much against the

1707.12 --> 1711.559
Catholic church because they realize

1709.22 --> 1714.58
what it really kind of is

1711.559 --> 1714.58
it's more about control

1715.34 --> 1718.779
and centralized power

1736.1 --> 1738.52
right

1757.88 --> 1762.74
wow okay flutter Sage that's that's

1761.059 --> 1764.12
rough

1762.74 --> 1766.82
yeah

1764.12 --> 1769.4599999999998
oh that's the whole thing like nobody's

1766.82 --> 1772.22
in history has been attacking other

1769.46 --> 1774.98
Christians like the Catholic Church

1772.22 --> 1778.22
the Inquisition and

1774.98 --> 1781.179
terrible things

1778.22 --> 1785.419
like the whole war with the Protestants

1781.179 --> 1785.419
they were maniacs

1795.98 --> 1799.659
yeah very disgusting

1826.94 --> 1831.14
I'm holding back too much you know I'm

1828.98 --> 1833.48
just not I'm

1831.14 --> 1836.779
I'm in a good place right now I don't

1833.48 --> 1838.82
want to get super outrage mode

1836.779 --> 1841.1
thanks

1838.82 --> 1842.899
holds back

1841.1 --> 1846.279
I'm not really holding back it's just

1842.899 --> 1846.279
not really the time for that

1846.74 --> 1851.36
it's like no I'm not some

1849.919 --> 1854.8400000000001
guy you

1851.36 --> 1858.279
you can just turn on and like turn the

1854.84 --> 1858.279
rage win on or something no

1859.159 --> 1863.0
the yeah

1861.019 --> 1866.0
Catholic church has done a whole bunch

1863.0 --> 1869.539
of terrible things

1866.0 --> 1870.86
for a very long time too

1869.539 --> 1873.26
it

1870.86 --> 1874.6399999999999
and I think that people that are kind of

1873.26 --> 1877.96
wiser

1874.64 --> 1880.3990000000001
even within it do realize that it is a

1877.96 --> 1883.519
two-faced Beast

1880.399 --> 1886.58
on one side it's supposedly doing good

1883.519 --> 1888.32
but playing politics with it a lot

1886.58 --> 1891.5
on the other side there's just this

1888.32 --> 1894.1399999999999
really really nasty part

1891.5 --> 1896.72
like that kind of Prides to be the most

1894.14 --> 1899.5590000000002
evil you know that's that's in there

1896.72 --> 1899.559
it's crazy

1899.96 --> 1904.96
like

1901.88 --> 1904.96
I think that

1905.779 --> 1914.419
like the the modern Catholics

1910.82 --> 1916.9399999999998
however that eventually became to be

1914.419 --> 1920.179
I think they're basically the

1916.94 --> 1922.88
the ones that really even designed

1920.179 --> 1925.46
the satanic mindset I think that

1922.88 --> 1927.98
Catholics designed the Reversed World

1925.46 --> 1930.32
thinking

1927.98 --> 1932.08
it came out of there Jesuits or

1930.32 --> 1935.539
something

1932.08 --> 1940.36
because they're just like they make

1935.539 --> 1940.36
with pride the most evil [ __ ]

1941.059 --> 1946.58
they're basically like yeah we are the

1943.519 --> 1949.3990000000001
biggest satanists ever

1946.58 --> 1952.1589999999999
pretending to be Christians

1949.399 --> 1953.779
and people are kind of like buying it

1952.159 --> 1955.94
even though they're not buying it

1953.779 --> 1957.679
they're still buying it

1955.94 --> 1960.3200000000002
right on the surface they might not be

1957.679 --> 1963.14
buying it but it's too much effort to

1960.32 --> 1964.279
actually even let it sink what it all

1963.14 --> 1967.779
really is

1964.279 --> 1967.779
so we're getting away with it

1973.94 --> 1977.799
is that good enough for you Kevlar

1983.12 --> 1988.7199999999998
fun

1985.279 --> 1988.72
another insult okay

2021.58 --> 2026.98
hmm

2023.559 --> 2028.96
yeah drinking of blood Christ yeah it's

2026.98 --> 2032.64
ridiculous

2028.96 --> 2032.64
like the whole drinking of blood

2032.74 --> 2036.36
that's well it's

2038.019 --> 2043.059
for some reason that was really popular

2040.179 --> 2045.3990000000001
in medieval times like there's like

2043.059 --> 2049.86
disgusting

2045.399 --> 2049.8599999999997
things that has happened a lot

2051.22 --> 2057.1589999999997
in those times it's so gross

2054.22 --> 2059.2
where yeah like if people would be

2057.159 --> 2061.899
executed through beheading and all that

2059.2 --> 2065.56
people would actually just

2061.899 --> 2067.96
get like bowls and [ __ ] and start

2065.56 --> 2070.119
collecting the blood of that

2067.96 --> 2072.7
and I I don't know what that was even

2070.119 --> 2074.3790000000004
for whether they'd use it to fertilize

2072.7 --> 2079.5
their ground or whether they would

2074.379 --> 2079.5
consume it's just so so gross

2079.899 --> 2084.399
and I think that the entire concept of

2082.419 --> 2087.5989999999997
drinking the blood of Christ still kind

2084.399 --> 2090.0989999999997
of stems from that whatever that was

2087.599 --> 2091.619
whether I don't even know where it came

2090.099 --> 2095.8790000000004
from that whole

2091.619 --> 2095.8790000000004
response is so gross

2113.68 --> 2121.68
all right yeah no Kepler I know I know I

2117.099 --> 2121.6800000000003
know you didn't try to poke me like that

2127.63 --> 2130.6890000000003
[Music]

2139.48 --> 2144.839
right but anyway like again drinking the

2142.24 --> 2144.839
blood of Christ

2148.18 --> 2154.54
I don't know if it is truly satanic in

2152.02 --> 2156.04
the in the modern sense

2154.54 --> 2158.38
I don't know

2156.04 --> 2160.7799999999997
because I don't really understand where

2158.38 --> 2163.0
that entire habit

2160.78 --> 2166.1400000000003
the blood collection I don't know where

2163.0 --> 2166.14
it came from you see

2166.9 --> 2171.82
like that might have been going on for a

2169.119 --> 2174.339
while or I don't understand it

2171.82 --> 2178.98
where it came from to so to say oh the

2174.339 --> 2178.98
blood of Christ it is satanic well

2180.0 --> 2188.38
it's kind of like more pointless it it

2185.26 --> 2191.619
ignores the teaching it's again back to

2188.38 --> 2193.54
the Earthly away from the spirit and the

2191.619 --> 2194.619
conscious which is what Christ really

2193.54 --> 2196.72
wanted

2194.619 --> 2198.6400000000003
to go there

2196.72 --> 2201.0989999999997
and in that sense you could say it's

2198.64 --> 2203.859
satanic but as in just because it's

2201.099 --> 2205.48
blood it's satanic I don't know because

2203.859 --> 2209.7599999999998
I don't know

2205.48 --> 2212.7400000000002
where all that blood stuff

2209.76 --> 2215.6800000000003
bloodletting collecting blood I don't

2212.74 --> 2218.9799999999996
know where it came from you see I don't

2215.68 --> 2221.7599999999998
know it might be like way older than

2218.98 --> 2221.76
Christianity

2222.94 --> 2227.44
so to just call it Satanic because of

2225.16 --> 2229.1189999999997
the blood I don't know but it it doesn't

2227.44 --> 2231.04
help

2229.119 --> 2233.5
trying to understand the teachings of

2231.04 --> 2237.119
Christ in that sense on an esoteric

2233.5 --> 2237.119
level it is kind of satanic

2255.28 --> 2261.4
and by the way in general I think that

2257.92 --> 2264.46
the entire over focus on Christ's death

2261.4 --> 2266.14
it's like everything and all the rituals

2264.46 --> 2270.16
it's all about his freaking death and

2266.14 --> 2272.68
I'm like that's just insane

2270.16 --> 2275.859
like you've turned their religion into

2272.68 --> 2279.0989999999997
the worship of the torture

2275.859 --> 2281.56
of a brilliant man like that's don't you

2279.099 --> 2284.26
even see that

2281.56 --> 2286.839
you're constantly worshiping the torture

2284.26 --> 2289.2000000000003
of a one of the most brilliant people

2286.839 --> 2289.2
ever

2293.079 --> 2298.599
like why aren't why isn't everything

2295.54 --> 2302.14
just surrounding his teachings why

2298.599 --> 2305.5
why is it always about his death

2302.14 --> 2308.74
oh because of the special boy's spell

2305.5 --> 2311.26
oh he saved you from your sins oh

2308.74 --> 2315.0989999999997
right

2311.26 --> 2318.2200000000003
so how did he do that exactly oh it just

2315.099 --> 2320.7400000000002
follow the priest chant and now you're

2318.22 --> 2323.3799999999997
saved so

2320.74 --> 2328.1189999999997
how about his teachings didn't his

2323.38 --> 2329.7400000000002
teachings actually cause the change

2328.119 --> 2333.2200000000003
way back then

2329.74 --> 2335.0789999999997
and he can exact that change on you if

2333.22 --> 2337.48
you follow his teachings if you actually

2335.079 --> 2339.94
try to understand what he was doing

2337.48 --> 2342.52
why don't you step away from focusing on

2339.94 --> 2344.8
how he freaking died for your

2342.52 --> 2347.02
convenience yeah because that's

2344.8 --> 2349.96
basically what it is yeah Christ dying

2347.02 --> 2353.64
for your convenience it's very

2349.96 --> 2358.06
egotistical if you ask me

2353.64 --> 2360.22
and actually start focusing in on what

2358.06 --> 2362.46
was he actually doing how was he doing

2360.22 --> 2362.4599999999996
it

2363.88 --> 2368.82
what

2365.14 --> 2368.8199999999997
did he reveal

2374.56 --> 2381.48
right so that's a summary of my

2377.32 --> 2381.48
criticism my general criticism

2381.7 --> 2385.8999999999996
uh

2383.32 --> 2387.88
Catholic Christianity and unfortunately

2385.9 --> 2390.46
most others

2387.88 --> 2393.78
most other organized christianities are

2390.46 --> 2393.78
all surrounding that

2395.68 --> 2402.5989999999997
did you watch Nano man yet yes

2398.859 --> 2402.5989999999997
from spacebusters right

2402.64 --> 2407.22
yeah I watched it in some other videos

2404.8 --> 2407.2200000000003
too

2410.2 --> 2414.06
yeah it was very straightforward

2421.24 --> 2426.1189999999997
how was it yeah it was pretty impressive

2426.46 --> 2431.619
like it made sense it basically

2428.56 --> 2435.4
connected the different factors

2431.619 --> 2437.1400000000003
put it down in the in a pretty succinct

2435.4 --> 2440.5
picture

2437.14 --> 2444.06
like I said like like I myself was

2440.5 --> 2449.079
describing before I had even watched it

2444.06 --> 2451.0
radiographic control nanotech antenna

2449.079 --> 2454.8590000000004
and how are they getting it in there

2451.0 --> 2454.859
that's what that video was all about

2455.44 --> 2461.56
so like a radio graphically controlled

2459.76 --> 2463.9
Borg

2461.56 --> 2465.4
group that they're trying to create and

2463.9 --> 2468.1600000000003
oh they can't get it in you through

2465.4 --> 2470.319
vaccines anymore properly well then just

2468.16 --> 2472.8999999999996
get it in you through the tests

2470.319 --> 2475.18
just get the antennas in right close to

2472.9 --> 2476.26
like a really important part of your

2475.18 --> 2481.1189999999997
brain

2476.26 --> 2485.2200000000003
like those deep nose swap tests I do not

2481.119 --> 2485.2200000000003
understand why people allow that

2485.319 --> 2493.66
like I my very Instinct would absolutely

2489.4 --> 2496.3
not allow anybody ever to do that

2493.66 --> 2498.7599999999998
because it would feel like this is a

2496.3 --> 2503.28
serious risk of a lobotomy

2498.76 --> 2503.28
like I've never had that done but even

2504.579 --> 2511.54
even just like the idea it's so crazy

2508.5 --> 2515.4
it's so crazy that people allowed

2511.54 --> 2515.4
themselves to undergo that

2516.04 --> 2523.119
like that's seriously insane

2519.7 --> 2525.52
you're basically just for because of

2523.119 --> 2529.06
freaking state says so you're risking a

2525.52 --> 2531.42
lobotomy on a regular basis and it's not

2529.06 --> 2534.7599999999998
an over exaggerated that's not fair

2531.42 --> 2536.319
that's actually true

2534.76 --> 2539.88
crazy

2536.319 --> 2543.88
it's not just stupid it's like

2539.88 --> 2547.6600000000003
devastatingly insane

2543.88 --> 2549.46
because it's it even touches the

2547.66 --> 2551.859
Instinct right if you have a freaking

2549.46 --> 2553.7200000000003
injection and you're kind of stupid and

2551.859 --> 2556.18
you're really ill-informed and really

2553.72 --> 2558.4599999999996
trusting I'd be like yeah you can't be

2556.18 --> 2560.9199999999996
fooled by that it's terrible but

2558.46 --> 2562.359
sticking that thing right down the back

2560.92 --> 2565.96
of your nose

2562.359 --> 2569.92
you can feel what's going on if you

2565.96 --> 2574.3
actually allow yourself to undergo that

2569.92 --> 2576.94
and more than once you are you know

2574.3 --> 2580.0
you know what the [ __ ] you're doing on

2576.94 --> 2581.98
an instinctual level you know

2580.0 --> 2585.22
you're literally

2581.98 --> 2590.16
killing your brain your spirit

2585.22 --> 2590.16
by allowing Society to do that

2591.04 --> 2598.14
totally insane

2593.5 --> 2598.14
like that's actual cult Behavior

2601.24 --> 2606.54
as in can be categorized as official

2604.8 --> 2609.1600000000003
cult

2606.54 --> 2611.8
official cult Behavior

2609.16 --> 2613.96
to allow yourself to get

2611.8 --> 2616.6800000000003
yeah

2613.96 --> 2616.68
this

2617.02 --> 2620.339
is totally insane

2643.0 --> 2646.599
yeah I wish I didn't know what it was

2645.579 --> 2649.119
like

2646.599 --> 2652.7400000000002
unfortunately my Dark World Visions have

2649.119 --> 2652.7400000000002
not allowed me that luxury

2655.72 --> 2661.1189999999997
I think in the dark world I pretty much

2658.24 --> 2664.18
allowed every freaking procedure ever

2661.119 --> 2665.7400000000002
imagined to be tested on me

2664.18 --> 2668.2
thank God

2665.74 --> 2671.7
never nothing like that's ever gonna

2668.2 --> 2671.7
happen in the physical real world

2672.339 --> 2677.98
God why did I do that

2675.64 --> 2679.359
I didn't know I was gonna do that or I

2677.98 --> 2683.319
did know but

2679.359 --> 2685.859
it made sense to do that for some reason

2683.319 --> 2685.859
God

2688.48 --> 2690.96
ugh

2693.64 --> 2700.42
I mean undergoing like a horrific

2697.18 --> 2702.64
atrocities in the simulation in the dark

2700.42 --> 2704.319
world has actually provided me with

2702.64 --> 2706.7999999999997
indirect

2704.319 --> 2710.079
personal experience

2706.8 --> 2712.42
undergoing and doing things

2710.079 --> 2715.7200000000003
that thank God I'll never ever

2712.42 --> 2718.359
physically do in the real world

2715.72 --> 2720.9599999999996
if I yeah

2718.359 --> 2720.96
I guess

2721.359 --> 2725.94
this video must trigger trouble what are

2723.46 --> 2725.94
you talking about

2726.46 --> 2731.04
hello flat fellow that flat fellow good

2728.68 --> 2731.04
to see you

2760.599 --> 2765.48
oh somebody's been happy or Rocket Man

2763.18 --> 2769.06
or you're just kind of a

2765.48 --> 2770.98
anti-flatter troll

2769.06 --> 2773.619
right and then you get banned a lot

2770.98 --> 2775.8
because it's very annoying to have you

2773.619 --> 2775.8
around

2779.859 --> 2783.359
hey wrath good to see you

2789.56 --> 2797.5589999999997

2800.8 --> 2805.78
talking about jeffcast had what video

2802.72 --> 2808.3799999999997
most trigger trolls

2805.78 --> 2808.38
what

2820.0 --> 2824.44
they were filming a movie Halloween ends

2822.819 --> 2827.94
at your house because it's so creepy you

2824.44 --> 2827.94
mean your house is so creepy

2836.8 --> 2842.1400000000003
this man bought bands ever okay so they

2840.16 --> 2845.74
got Rogue mods yeah I'm not surprised

2842.14 --> 2849.819
because the Discord is

2845.74 --> 2853.0
yeah yeah it's a [ __ ]

2849.819 --> 2855.099
yeah I'm just gonna say it as it is I'm

2853.0 --> 2859.54
sick of hearing people's complaints

2855.099 --> 2861.819
about how terrible the mod situation is

2859.54 --> 2866.079
over at Discord

2861.819 --> 2869.2
the the particular Surfers

2866.079 --> 2871.54
under Betty's control yeah it's terrible

2869.2 --> 2875.2599999999998
you've made a giant mess

2871.54 --> 2878.2
I don't even care to face you about it

2875.26 --> 2881.0200000000004
Betty because I think that you're just

2878.2 --> 2883.48
ridiculous with it you're ridiculous I

2881.02 --> 2886.059
don't care for your emotions and [ __ ]

2883.48 --> 2888.819
responses it's a mess

2886.059 --> 2890.92
the moderation is idiotic

2888.819 --> 2893.619
it's not under control it's getting

2890.92 --> 2895.42
worse it's not gonna go better it's only

2893.619 --> 2899.079
going to get worse

2895.42 --> 2902.38
and yeah why don't you do something once

2899.079 --> 2904.6600000000003
you actually do something about it

2902.38 --> 2907.7200000000003
clean up the mess it's been there for

2904.66 --> 2909.16
years now Betty

2907.72 --> 2911.5
clean it up

2909.16 --> 2913.5989999999997
stop complaining stop

2911.5 --> 2916.18
stop not doing it

2913.599 --> 2918.46
just do it clean it up

2916.18 --> 2920.319
appoint some people that are actually

2918.46 --> 2923.02
reliable

2920.319 --> 2924.339
and make sure that they cannot give

2923.02 --> 2927.339
wrenches away

2924.339 --> 2928.66
yeah have an exclusive right to give

2927.339 --> 2931.96
wrenches out

2928.66 --> 2934.54
ensure that literally no random mod is

2931.96 --> 2936.28
gonna [ __ ] infiltrate it again

2934.54 --> 2939.579
because that's what's happening it's

2936.28 --> 2942.0400000000004
being infiltrated by people that want to

2939.579 --> 2945.52
ruin it and you're not doing anything to

2942.04 --> 2945.52
stop it Betty

2948.7 --> 2952.0789999999997
or for 24 7

2952.24 --> 2958.18
oh that's that's another one

2956.68 --> 2960.7599999999998
I thought we're talking about Betty

2958.18 --> 2962.44
server the 24 7 Discord that's run by

2960.76 --> 2966.5200000000004
somebody else I don't know who does that

2962.44 --> 2969.9
it's all kinds of things happening there

2966.52 --> 2969.9
it's always been kind of messy

2974.619 --> 2981.6400000000003
but yeah who's Betty Betty fenfelson

2979.359 --> 2984.24
who's always on with Quantum eraser on

2981.64 --> 2984.24
his shows

2984.76 --> 2991.0
that Betty she's the owner of the server

2988.839 --> 2993.7799999999997
on which like the Flat Earth debate and

2991.0 --> 2993.78
the ball busters

2994.24 --> 2999.22
have their Discord it's through her

2996.339 --> 3000.48
server and there's always [ __ ] happening

2999.22 --> 3004.4399999999996
there

3000.48 --> 3008.94
and for years years and years and it's

3004.44 --> 3008.94
never been actually resolved

3010.079 --> 3014.1600000000003
every time somebody brings it up

3011.94 --> 3017.04
everybody's oh no

3014.16 --> 3019.319
oh it's not that bad and then if Betty

3017.04 --> 3021.18
gets involved she's just whining and

3019.319 --> 3023.4
complaining I'm sick of hearing that I

3021.18 --> 3026.3999999999996
don't ever want to hear a whine or

3023.4 --> 3027.839
complain response from Betty ever again

3026.4 --> 3030.059
about it

3027.839 --> 3032.2999999999997
why don't you just [ __ ] fix it

3030.059 --> 3032.3
already

3039.3 --> 3042.02
ugh

3086.819 --> 3092.4
Church of virology yeah yeah no yeah I

3090.66 --> 3094.319
chose one I'm definitely gonna look

3092.4 --> 3097.6800000000003
further through that channel because

3094.319 --> 3100.94
like all the videos so far have been

3097.68 --> 3100.94
really really good

3103.26 --> 3108.0
I guess that's not why he doesn't like

3105.54 --> 3112.02
make one every day or so

3108.0 --> 3113.94
because very obviously put a lot of

3112.02 --> 3118.94
attention

3113.94 --> 3118.94
and research in the videos so

3146.4 --> 3151.859
he likes her accent but not mine no it's

3148.92 --> 3154.92
not my accent he doesn't like

3151.859 --> 3158.7
it's that I don't take [ __ ] from him and

3154.92 --> 3161.2400000000002
I'm not like maneuvered a way out of a

3158.7 --> 3161.24
conversation

3175.74 --> 3181.02
right because I will address certain

3178.319 --> 3183.48
things I will

3181.02 --> 3186.359
bring up subjects

3183.48 --> 3189.48
that do kind of

3186.359 --> 3191.5789999999997
thread outside of Science in ways and he

3189.48 --> 3193.44
just doesn't want to know about it

3191.579 --> 3195.96
that's what he doesn't like and he knows

3193.44 --> 3199.079
I do that

3195.96 --> 3201.5
that's what he doesn't like

3199.079 --> 3205.579
the Betty never brings up anything

3201.5 --> 3205.579
physics related ever

3251.04 --> 3257.599
what the hell oh heliocentric what model

3257.839 --> 3262.02
you mean the conception that doesn't

3260.28 --> 3264.8
work Rocket Man

3262.02 --> 3264.8
come on now

3274.14 --> 3278.0
oh God not again

3312.78 --> 3314.96
foreign

3360.18 --> 3364.5589999999997
what the hell are you talking about

3361.799 --> 3368.88
trust a video

3364.559 --> 3372.8590000000004
Rocket Man nobody like just trusts a

3368.88 --> 3372.859
video we watch videos

3373.02 --> 3378.72
we check out what they have to share and

3375.78 --> 3380.88
yes sometimes some of it might be wrong

3378.72 --> 3383.22
we don't trust the video it's not like

3380.88 --> 3384.319
oh we just watched this video and now

3383.22 --> 3388.02
we're gonna

3384.319 --> 3392.299
lean every part of our convictions on

3388.02 --> 3392.299
that video what a ridiculous notion

3393.0 --> 3398.339
Rocket Man

3395.72 --> 3400.5589999999997
ridiculous yeah I know you were

3398.339 --> 3403.14
addressing Jeff and I'm getting involved

3400.559 --> 3406.02
yeah while you're bickering with people

3403.14 --> 3408.0

3411.66 --> 3415.799
other chat participants

3414.48 --> 3420.559
yeah

3415.799 --> 3420.559
that kind of falls under a rule

3420.599 --> 3423.8590000000004
it's called hecklers

3424.079 --> 3429.3590000000004
now you're not there yet

3426.24 --> 3431.3999999999996
but I don't like it when people just get

3429.359 --> 3433.68
in my chat and they're like no I'm

3431.4 --> 3438.119
having a conversation with somebody in

3463.619 --> 3468.359
outraged for me stepping in a

3465.839 --> 3472.0789999999997
conversation that you are having in my

3468.359 --> 3473.7599999999998

when I do spot like oh it's a name oh

3548.28 --> 3552.619

3550.92 --> 3557.819
very famous

3552.619 --> 3559.799
concept that's obviously from like some

3557.819 --> 3563.64
creepy ass

3559.799 --> 3566.7599999999998
satanic mind control mainstream media

3563.64 --> 3568.859
slash music industry project yeah it is

3566.76 --> 3571.3390000000004

3576.24 --> 3580.74
he's yeah it's a rocket with the pink

3578.579 --> 3583.319
behind it before that wasn't even a

3580.74 --> 3584.72
rainbow so yeah it was pretty straight

3583.319 --> 3588.66
out like

3584.72 --> 3591.18
yeah that's not somebody that's gonna be

3588.66 --> 3593.3999999999996
trustworthy anytime soon but I don't

3591.18 --> 3596.5789999999997
know he's been kind of at the halfway

3593.4 --> 3600.03
decent conversation list so far in chat

3596.579 --> 3603.119
right it's been a lot worse

3600.03 --> 3603.119
[Music]

3611.64 --> 3617.2799999999997
keep the meat and spit out the bones

3615.299 --> 3619.7
that's right gaining wisdom always a

3617.28 --> 3619.7000000000003
good tip

3620.28 --> 3624.5400000000004
right and if they're more bone than meat

3622.44 --> 3627.78
yeah well then

3624.54 --> 3632.339
you just get a piece of a bunch of

3627.78 --> 3634.26
scrapes and that entire bone just goes

3632.339 --> 3638.0
in the trash can or

3634.26 --> 3638.0
on the compost heap wherever

3648.42 --> 3654.859
the rocket man long time empty Flat

3650.819 --> 3654.859
Earth yeah no surprise there

3657.0 --> 3664.2
has he ever even piped up his voice

3661.26 --> 3667.099
or is he just like a chat

3664.2 --> 3667.0989999999997
roamer

3671.94 --> 3677.66
right so he's a yeah so he's effectively

3675.299 --> 3677.66
a

3677.819 --> 3682.5
less harmful troll basically

3682.98 --> 3688.44
right all right fine well they're around

3686.88 --> 3690.9
you know

3688.44 --> 3694.04
can always ban them

3690.9 --> 3694.04
they go too far

3700.74 --> 3707.4599999999996
hey Paul still don't you dare go after

3703.559 --> 3710.1600000000003
slo-mo Moon buggies my favorite

3707.46 --> 3711.78
one of my favorite

3710.16 --> 3714.5589999999997
names

3711.78 --> 3714.559
brilliant

3716.7 --> 3721.819
I don't think there's any kind of like

3718.64 --> 3726.0
weird ass song out there or something

3721.819 --> 3728.64
that's slo-mo moon buggy in it

3726.0 --> 3731.66
I think he made it of himself

3728.64 --> 3731.66
that's hilarious

3740.64 --> 3746.4
do you by chance have a vegetable garden

3744.359 --> 3749.9
no

3746.4 --> 3749.9
that would have been nice though

3750.599 --> 3755.579
like if I'd have a garden that's like

3753.18 --> 3761.1189999999997
one of the first things I actually go

3755.579 --> 3761.119
for I try to get some vegetables going

3777.119 --> 3782.6600000000003
YouTube names better than your bear name

3779.339 --> 3782.66
oh really what's your bear name

3801.5 --> 3805.92
well Kevlar

3803.94 --> 3808.799
troll multiple accounts that talk to

3805.92 --> 3810.7200000000003
himself Rocket Man

3808.799 --> 3812.7
it might be within the range of

3810.72 --> 3816.48
possibility I don't know if he's gone

3812.7 --> 3819.299
down that far just yet

3816.48 --> 3821.66
he might still or he might have done in

3819.299 --> 3821.66
the past

3823.14 --> 3828.48
that gets pretty pathetic if you start

3825.299 --> 3831.0
talking to yeah to your own if you start

3828.48 --> 3833.7
chatting back and forth

3831.0 --> 3837.119
with two accounts

3833.7 --> 3839.8999999999996
I haven't really spotted that though

3837.119 --> 3839.9
so far

3885.72 --> 3891.14
oh

3887.339 --> 3891.14
ah the Sun

3892.319 --> 3897.74
welcome back son

3894.78 --> 3897.7400000000002
missed you

3903.359 --> 3906.2599999999998
look at that

3925.74 --> 3929.72
we just smurfed the chat

3930.78 --> 3935.3590000000004
hahaha

3932.28 --> 3935.3590000000004
that's hilarious

3935.819 --> 3940.319
oh man that that sun is very welcome

3938.339 --> 3942.7799999999997
it's almost like my eyes are need to get

3940.319 --> 3945.24
used to it

3942.78 --> 3948.119
because it's been like really cloudy and

3945.24 --> 3950.4199999999996
for what is it now four or five days

3948.119 --> 3950.42
straight

3950.64 --> 3958.64
so this is like the first Sun Ray

3954.0 --> 3958.64
I'm seeing it in a while

3958.98 --> 3961.579
nice

3982.2 --> 3985.02
um

3982.799 --> 3987.299
yeah getting wisdom yeah entropy is

3985.02 --> 3989.28
definitely a

3987.299 --> 3993.119
big one

3989.28 --> 3995.7000000000003
also one of the most heavily resisted

3993.119 --> 3998.88
I can't believe how many

3995.7 --> 4002.359
globers in general keep saying like no

3998.88 --> 4005.1800000000003
no that's not what entropy is all about

4002.359 --> 4007.52
basically I wonder if they even realize

4005.18 --> 4010.18
that every time they say no no gas

4007.52 --> 4013.4
doesn't expand in all directions because

4010.18 --> 4016.0389999999998
ball Earth

4013.4 --> 4017.7200000000003
I don't understand if they even realized

4016.039 --> 4020.2400000000002
like

4017.72 --> 4023.48
they're basically just saying like no

4020.24 --> 4026.5589999999997
the law of nature gas expanding in all

4023.48 --> 4026.559
directions doesn't work

4027.859 --> 4033.5589999999997
I can't believe how casually so many

4030.74 --> 4035.18
have just thrown that overboard as an

4033.559 --> 4036.44
argument and just say no no it doesn't

4035.18 --> 4038.0589999999997
work like that

4036.44 --> 4040.7000000000003
really

4038.059 --> 4042.92
based on what why is everybody so easy

4040.7 --> 4045.5589999999997
to say that

4042.92 --> 4047.48
no no that's not how it works because it

4045.559 --> 4050.599
really is

4047.48 --> 4053.0
established as a natural law

4050.599 --> 4056.119
specifically gas expanding in all

4053.0 --> 4059.359
directions law of nature

4056.119 --> 4062.2400000000002
falls under the category second law of

4059.359 --> 4066.339
Thermodynamics but its effect on its own

4062.24 --> 4069.74
is just a widely established fact

4066.339 --> 4070.88
physics-based fact about gas how it

4069.74 --> 4073.0389999999998
works

4070.88 --> 4075.7400000000002
and to just say like oh no no that

4073.039 --> 4078.92
doesn't work

4075.74 --> 4081.8799999999997
I'm surprised how easily so many people

4078.92 --> 4081.88
jump to that

4092.72 --> 4100.12
doesn't guess heavier than air go down

4097.4 --> 4100.12
uh

4100.4 --> 4105.799
uh if it's prevented from expanding in

4103.52 --> 4108.02
all directions

4105.799 --> 4111.5
yes

4108.02 --> 4114.080000000001
then it will go down heavier gas if

4111.5 --> 4115.759
contained prevent it from expanding in

4114.08 --> 4117.799
all directions

4115.759 --> 4120.46
like in the balloon if it's heavier yeah

4117.799 --> 4120.46
it goes down

4121.52 --> 4125.96
but if it's not contained it's going to

4124.04 --> 4128.56
expand in all directions

4125.96 --> 4131.6
at first probably

4128.56 --> 4134.299
preferring preferring its expansion

4131.6 --> 4136.04
Direction down but eventually it will be

4134.299 --> 4140.5
in all directions

4136.04 --> 4140.5
it's only so far down you can go

4143.12 --> 4148.339
yeah so that doesn't really prove

4145.279 --> 4150.080000000001
anything that more dense gas goes down

4148.339 --> 4152.96
yeah we know

4150.08 --> 4155.96
because it's all about the relative

4152.96 --> 4159.9800000000005
density this equilibrium differential

4155.96 --> 4162.5
with the medium you're in which is gas

4159.98 --> 4165.379999999999
pressure at ground level

4162.5 --> 4167.6
it's just air pressure

4165.38 --> 4171.02
Standard air pressure

4167.6 --> 4173.779
and its density so if the gas that

4171.02 --> 4176.179
you're gonna unleash is more dense than

4173.779 --> 4178.279
that average it's gonna go down

4176.179 --> 4180.38
as long as it's contained now if it's

4178.279 --> 4183.679
not contained it's gonna go

4180.38 --> 4186.319
in all directions at first preferring

4183.679 --> 4187.759
down somewhat but eventually that's not

4186.319 --> 4189.88
yeah it's just gonna move in all

4187.759 --> 4189.88
directions

4192.62 --> 4196.84
so hope that clears things up

4206.6 --> 4211.659000000001
but yeah it seems like another Smurf has

4209.179 --> 4211.659
wandered in

4213.14 --> 4217.1
cool

4215.3 --> 4221.56
or not

4217.1 --> 4221.56
it's rubber digital surf are you a Smurf

4222.56 --> 4228.820000000001
not I'm not sure

4225.5 --> 4228.82
hello serious truth

4230.719 --> 4232.9
foreign

4249.52 --> 4254.1990000000005
steals really

4251.659 --> 4254.199
okay

4261.32 --> 4264.28
how would I know

4264.739 --> 4268.659
well what do you think science is

4271.76 --> 4276.9800000000005
do you think that you can science

4274.46 --> 4278.54
anything

4276.98 --> 4280.82
like

4278.54 --> 4283.3
dropping a lighter is science do you

4280.82 --> 4283.299999999999
think it's science

4307.52 --> 4314.1990000000005
well rubber digital you think that

4310.28 --> 4314.199
dropping something is science

4314.719 --> 4321.199
the discovery of our natural okay

4318.32 --> 4323.48
that's a nice attempt you're still a

4321.199 --> 4326.239
Smurf though

4323.48 --> 4328.04
because science is not the discovery of

4326.239 --> 4331.0599999999995
the natural world

4328.04 --> 4331.06
it's a method

4337.219 --> 4342.38
your definition of science determines if

4339.38 --> 4345.34
you're a Smurf yeah that's right

4342.38 --> 4345.34
that's correct

4347.84 --> 4351.1990000000005
because if you think you can sign

4349.58 --> 4354.62
everything

4351.199 --> 4356.96
well that means you're a Smurf because

4354.62 --> 4358.5199999999995
that's what Smurfs do they Smurfs just

4356.96 --> 4359.719
Smurf everything

4358.52 --> 4362.06
right

4359.719 --> 4364.52
I use the Smurf method

4362.06 --> 4366.9800000000005
the Smurf this they smears that but yeah

4364.52 --> 4369.1990000000005
if push comes to shove and you basically

4366.98 --> 4371.239
force them on the spot to

4369.199 --> 4374.98
explain they're just gonna say no no no

4371.239 --> 4374.98
no Smurf doesn't prove anything

4375.199 --> 4378.699
it just proves everything

4378.739 --> 4382.299999999999
and that makes you a Smurf

4383.42 --> 4388.84
you can't use science on the

4385.52 --> 4388.84
supernatural yes you can

4390.5 --> 4393.46
yes you can

4394.159 --> 4400.639999999999
information is Supernatural there is

4397.46 --> 4402.7390000000005
scientific experimentation with the

4400.64 --> 4404.62
supernatural with information it has

4402.739 --> 4406.218999999999
distinct

4404.62 --> 4409.88
effects

4406.219 --> 4412.52
palpable physics-based effects

4409.88 --> 4413.659000000001
lies within the region of quantum

4412.52 --> 4416.84
mechanics

4413.659 --> 4419.239
which is controversial and there's

4416.84 --> 4421.219
things wrong with it in my opinion my

4419.239 --> 4423.139999999999
research so far

4421.219 --> 4425.9
but yeah

4423.14 --> 4428.4800000000005
no actually the scientific method deals

4425.9 --> 4430.719
with things you can very manipulate that

4428.48 --> 4434.0599999999995
are natural phenomena

4430.719 --> 4437.56
and Supernatural falls under that as

4434.06 --> 4437.56
well in this case

4440.12 --> 4443.26
the knowing

4444.86 --> 4453.44
no no no ghosts is not Supernatural that

4449.06 --> 4456.1990000000005
no Supernatural is actually substance

4453.44 --> 4458.36
I'm talking about physics classification

4456.199 --> 4460.699
Supernatural

4458.36 --> 4463.46
I guess you weren't I think that you

4460.699 --> 4466.159
were using it on ghosts well that's all

4463.46 --> 4468.56
super cute but you can use it on ghosts

4466.159 --> 4471.0199999999995
just as well

4468.56 --> 4472.6990000000005
if you have any inkling as to what the

4471.02 --> 4475.0
[ __ ] you're doing and how things really

4472.699 --> 4475.0
work

4476.54 --> 4482.179
ghosts like gravity is

4479.36 --> 4485.0
no nice talking about spiritual

4482.179 --> 4487.96
apparitions I'm pretty damn sure they

4485.0 --> 4487.96
can be Quantified

4489.38 --> 4495.5
and categorized and proven effect could

4492.62 --> 4497.86
be proven with that it's just like why

4495.5 --> 4497.86
though

4499.699 --> 4504.099999999999
it's not really the Sciences Department

4506.36 --> 4510.259999999999
there's usually like if ghosts become a

4509.36 --> 4513.0199999999995
problem

4510.26 --> 4514.64
you don't really have to science it or

4513.02 --> 4517.280000000001
rather it's already been done right

4514.64 --> 4520.6990000000005
because oh what causes ghosts yeah

4517.28 --> 4522.679
they're electromagnetic absorption that

4520.699 --> 4524.719
then Echoes on the spirit of a person

4522.679 --> 4528.1990000000005
and that's how you see it that's how

4524.719 --> 4529.28
they basically the effect Taps into your

4528.199 --> 4532.04
energy

4529.28 --> 4534.38
to manifest things

4532.04 --> 4535.159
yeah yeah I've done some research in the

4534.38 --> 4537.679
past

4535.159 --> 4541.4
it's not scientific research though

4537.679 --> 4542.84
it's just research and you can

4541.4 --> 4546.739
neutralize that

4542.84 --> 4549.860000000001
you can literally wipe the ghosts

4546.739 --> 4552.459999999999
out of material through electromagnetic

4549.86 --> 4552.46
impulse

4552.679 --> 4557.6
you can neutralize it like

4555.32 --> 4559.46
deleting a hard disk

4557.6 --> 4561.26
serious

4559.46 --> 4564.219
it's very similar actually to the

4561.26 --> 4564.219
leading a hard disk

4565.34 --> 4568.78
because that's magnetic as well

4570.92 --> 4578.6
so yeah there's absolutely things that

4575.179 --> 4581.679
involve ghosts that could be described

4578.6 --> 4581.679
extremely mechanical

4583.64 --> 4587.02
I'm afraid of no ghost

4587.239 --> 4590.08
good for you

4590.719 --> 4594.88
ghosts can't really do anything anyway

4594.98 --> 4600.739
they can only use what you allow them to

4598.76 --> 4603.400000000001
take

4600.739 --> 4605.959999999999
very similar to other

4603.4 --> 4608.599999999999
Supernatural things

4605.96 --> 4610.58
extra dimensional Spirits it's the same

4608.6 --> 4612.679
they don't really do anything everything

4610.58 --> 4615.58
they do is through

4612.679 --> 4615.58
our power

4622.64 --> 4627.38
I'm originally yeah I know it's

4624.32 --> 4630.259999999999
Ghostbusters I I'm not just gonna oh

4627.38 --> 4631.9400000000005
look somebody made a standard joke about

4630.26 --> 4635.4800000000005
something that everybody in the world

4631.94 --> 4638.48
knows about hahaha that's funny no I'm

4635.48 --> 4641.178999999999
just gonna ignore that and then take it

4638.48 --> 4643.639999999999
literal that's what I do

4641.179 --> 4645.4400000000005
it's what I always do if the joke is too

4643.64 --> 4649.06
straightforward I don't think it's funny

4645.44 --> 4649.0599999999995
I'm just gonna take it little

4649.52 --> 4654.360000000001
like a weird autistic trait or something

4652.219 --> 4657.45
it's just what I do

4654.36 --> 4657.45
[Music]

4663.02 --> 4669.56
Ghostbusters movie which one oh God

4667.28 --> 4671.239
that one yeah I haven't even watched

4669.56 --> 4675.219
that

4671.239 --> 4675.218999999999
the trailer was more than enough

4688.4 --> 4695.239
it was better oh wait yeah yeah the old

4691.28 --> 4697.88
girl one was absolutely atrocious

4695.239 --> 4702.339999999999
and I've heard that the new one was kind

4697.88 --> 4702.34
of like at least trying a little

4704.78 --> 4710.54
but really for me it's like it's

4708.62 --> 4714.98
it's not really even that interesting

4710.54 --> 4717.44
like watching back the old movies that's

4714.98 --> 4719.718999999999
interesting it's interesting those

4717.44 --> 4723.08
movies are interesting those people are

4719.719 --> 4724.46
actual representation of people

4723.08 --> 4728.179
they have

4724.46 --> 4731.3
like Spirits even of that place

4728.179 --> 4735.38
of New York you know it's a real movie

4731.3 --> 4738.7390000000005
right the modern [ __ ] is all garbage

4735.38 --> 4740.06
there's nothing left of of like the

4738.739 --> 4744.5199999999995
culture

4740.06 --> 4744.52
just garbage it's all been destroyed

4761.48 --> 4770.259999999999
right like Ghostbusters worked

4765.76 --> 4770.26
because it was the 80s

4771.679 --> 4775.219
does that make sense

4773.54 --> 4779.62
does to me

4775.219 --> 4779.62
it worked because it was the 80s

4781.46 --> 4788.6
because of where understanding and

4785.06 --> 4794.06
knowledge and people's mindsets were at

4788.6 --> 4797.8
the time that's why Ghostbusters worked

4794.06 --> 4797.8
it's not because oh they got the

4798.159 --> 4801.58
no that's

4801.92 --> 4807.38
those are the like the McGuffin to

4804.92 --> 4811.1
that over

4807.38 --> 4813.400000000001
spanning McGuffin to really kind of keep

4811.1 --> 4816.139
the movie going no but the whole

4813.4 --> 4817.638999999999
Ghostbusters was about where everybody

4816.139 --> 4820.400000000001
was at

4817.639 --> 4822.26
the time it was more like a cultural

4820.4 --> 4825.0199999999995
movie

4822.26 --> 4827.659000000001
in many ways that's what made it great

4825.02 --> 4832.4800000000005
it doesn't work now it doesn't work like

4827.659 --> 4832.48
40 years later it just doesn't

4832.76 --> 4839.679
The World Isn't like that anymore it's

4835.1 --> 4839.679
not fun it's not interesting anymore

4845.239 --> 4848.78
yeah Big Trouble in Little China also

4847.699 --> 4851.54
Epic

4848.78 --> 4853.46
but very much of that time like that

4851.54 --> 4856.239
wouldn't work anymore if you remade it

4853.46 --> 4856.2390000000005
it just wouldn't

4862.04 --> 4865.12
oh dear

4886.639 --> 4893.8
they had Eon pasted in in the end okay

4890.6 --> 4893.8
that is kind of creepy

4918.159 --> 4924.0199999999995
all right I don't know maybe that second

4921.679 --> 4926.12
one I will check it out at some point

4924.02 --> 4928.6990000000005
it's just

4926.12 --> 4932.42
like it's never gonna have that

4928.699 --> 4934.82
just that real Alchemy

4932.42 --> 4937.639
that the first movie and even the second

4934.82 --> 4940.12
one still a bit but especially the first

4937.639 --> 4940.12
one had

4940.76 --> 4946.780000000001
because the first Ghostbusters movie it

4943.04 --> 4946.78
was really just a timepiece

4947.3 --> 4953.5
like a a snapshot of what it was like

4951.199 --> 4953.5
then

4953.78 --> 4957.98
back then

4955.52 --> 4960.620000000001
there in that place

4957.98 --> 4962.48
with the real people what it was like to

4960.62 --> 4964.699
them what was the tension how was

4962.48 --> 4967.12
everybody composing themselves it's all

4964.699 --> 4967.12
in there

4968.239 --> 4973.58
and even like the music was really off

4971.48 --> 4976.159
that time and like it's really a

4973.58 --> 4979.78
timepiece Ghostbusters the original

4976.159 --> 4979.78
movie is a timepiece

4982.76 --> 4989.4800000000005
yeah the irony of you is somebody

4985.4 --> 4992.5599999999995
I pasted into a movie yeah

4989.48 --> 4992.5599999999995
I get that

5025.84 --> 5030.58
hmm

5027.94 --> 5033.599999999999
okay don't give me too many spoilers

5030.58 --> 5033.6
there Paul still

5034.12 --> 5037.659
right

5035.5 --> 5040.44
it was weird

5037.659 --> 5040.44
we'll see

5073.08 --> 5076.38
triangulation if

5093.94 --> 5099.719
it's just about worth watching if you're

5096.159 --> 5099.719
bored okay well that sounds great

5101.739 --> 5106.239
like if at least it's not boring or just

5104.44 --> 5108.879999999999
gross constantly

5106.239 --> 5113.459999999999
are super annoying

5108.88 --> 5113.46
then that's fine maybe I'll check it out

5119.8 --> 5123.4800000000005
what's it called by the way

5123.76 --> 5128.9400000000005
so I can

5125.86 --> 5128.94
dig it out

5129.86 --> 5132.929999999999
[Music]

5136.16 --> 5139.3
[Applause]

5141.82 --> 5145.38
so afterlife right

5163.54 --> 5166.84
right

5164.739 --> 5170.28
okay

5166.84 --> 5170.28
I'm going to download that

5184.42 --> 5187.08
right

5188.219 --> 5193.5
okay I'm gonna take a two minute break

5190.6 --> 5193.5
be right back

5273.88 --> 5276.0
thank you

5281.94 --> 5285.36
all right man

5306.34 --> 5311.26
anyway let's guys let's talk about

5308.92 --> 5316.32
something

5311.26 --> 5316.320000000001
I got 15 more minutes or less

5367.719 --> 5371.02
all right guys I'm gonna round out the

5370.06 --> 5374.080000000001
show

5371.02 --> 5376.2390000000005
because it's not really a lot of

5374.08 --> 5380.219
conversation Happening Here don't

5376.239 --> 5380.218999999999
particularly feel inspired

5382.96 --> 5388.12
which I guess every now and then is a

5385.54 --> 5391.739
good thing because constantly being too

5388.12 --> 5391.739
inspired is kind of stressful

5392.199 --> 5398.259999999999
but yeah I'm still always open for

5394.48 --> 5400.12
inquiry and clarification or

5398.26 --> 5402.58
I think you got a good lead to some

5400.12 --> 5404.8
Channel that I should check out then

5402.58 --> 5407.32
yeah I might just be like oh no I'm not

5404.8 --> 5410.38
gonna oh it's probably lame that might

5407.32 --> 5412.42
be my first response because I'm kind of

5410.38 --> 5413.26
overwhelmed with everything that's out

5412.42 --> 5416.08
there

5413.26 --> 5419.26
and not all of it is all that great

5416.08 --> 5422.88
but yes face Busters that was definitely

5419.26 --> 5422.88
a very very good Channel

5424.84 --> 5430.2390000000005
it's always good when you're mistaken

5428.44 --> 5434.159
about that

5430.239 --> 5434.159
something turns out to be really great

5440.199 --> 5443.919999999999
I'm gonna make every comments on

5441.82 --> 5446.739
non-feed channels The Smurfs always find

5443.92 --> 5448.36
you yeah yeah no but they were all

5446.739 --> 5451.78
Smurfs

5448.36 --> 5455.679
they just when they're not confronted

5451.78 --> 5459.179
with flat Earth then yeah the Smurf

5455.679 --> 5459.179
it just lays dormant

5460.239 --> 5466.0599999999995
oh the moon just spare no yeah I did I

5463.9 --> 5468.94
did check it out for a bit but I didn't

5466.06 --> 5473.1
watch it actually sorry

5468.94 --> 5473.099999999999
I am subscribed I think now

5483.639 --> 5486.719
what's a Smurf

5487.239 --> 5493.0599999999995
well Lydia logs what's science

5490.719 --> 5495.96
my question to you

5493.06 --> 5495.96
what is science

5505.0 --> 5508.3
is an interesting dude yeah it looked

5506.92 --> 5511.92
interesting

5508.3 --> 5511.92
short blue people no

5513.639 --> 5518.38
no yeah that's what a Smurf's supposed

5515.38 --> 5521.1
to be but in this case it's not it's a

5518.38 --> 5521.1
metaphor

5522.639 --> 5526.3
so Lydia looks you're going to answer

5524.44 --> 5529.199
that

5526.3 --> 5529.1990000000005
what's science

5537.04 --> 5543.36
the study of natural oh well then you're

5540.76 --> 5543.360000000001
a Smurf

5561.82 --> 5565.599999999999
uh how's Owen doing these days yeah

5564.219 --> 5569.679
pretty good

5565.6 --> 5573.120000000001
it's been on a China rant a lot

5569.679 --> 5573.12
that's really funny though

5573.699 --> 5578.62
but yeah it's just

5575.38 --> 5581.88
keeping going it's pretty cool I watched

5578.62 --> 5581.88
it even before this show

5590.739 --> 5593.218999999999
hey

5593.86 --> 5596.58
what's this

5598.179 --> 5601.38
I got a PayPal

5602.26 --> 5606.719
I didn't say so though but thanks

5607.719 --> 5612.78
I think that guy down here before I'm

5609.639 --> 5612.78
not sure who it was again

5614.739 --> 5618.759999999999
but yeah that's great I just checked it

5617.26 --> 5620.46
because I just thought oh let's just

5618.76 --> 5622.900000000001
randomly check it

5620.46 --> 5624.76
but there's actually something on it so

5622.9 --> 5627.54
thank you very much

5624.76 --> 5627.54
uh

5632.62 --> 5636.239
don't remember who that was

5639.58 --> 5643.139
but yeah very helpful

5645.94 --> 5652.138999999999
pick up and chat

5648.58 --> 5652.139
if you know it was you

5659.8 --> 5666.159000000001
I'm a stream on the wallenbergs yeah

5662.159 --> 5670.48
fascinating and creepy perhaps

5666.159 --> 5673.48
the wallenbergs just make me nervous

5670.48 --> 5677.04
I've got this weird sensation like I I

5673.48 --> 5677.04
met some of them at some point

5679.54 --> 5683.639
but I'm not sure it could have been Dark

5681.4 --> 5683.638999999999
World

5686.5 --> 5692.139
but I I do not like them at all because

5689.86 --> 5695.139
they are like

5692.139 --> 5695.139
anti-paths

5695.739 --> 5699.9
like everything about them is like

5697.84 --> 5704.02
literally

5699.9 --> 5706.599999999999
surrender all all feelings for profit

5704.02 --> 5708.34
all of it as I don't want to have

5706.6 --> 5711.34
anything to do with that I am

5708.34 --> 5715.38
diametrically opposed in my very core

5711.34 --> 5715.38
Essence to everything they do

5722.08 --> 5724.679
ugh

5729.4 --> 5734.879999999999
I pity anybody who does business with

5731.619 --> 5734.88
him I really do

5735.52 --> 5741.34
because they ask you to do stuff that

5738.04 --> 5743.5
you nobody wants to do

5741.34 --> 5746.04
and if you do then you're a [ __ ]

5743.5 --> 5746.04
psycho

5763.659 --> 5767.5599999999995
yeah

5765.46 --> 5770.56
yeah me too Paul still you know I really

5767.56 --> 5774.280000000001
appreciate Owen Benjamin's work

5770.56 --> 5777.46
and he definitely does not self-censor

5774.28 --> 5779.32
I keep myself censorship to an absolute

5777.46 --> 5781.96
minimum

5779.32 --> 5785.0199999999995
I'm still kind of annoyed that I decided

5781.96 --> 5787.719
at some point to call it C and V

5785.02 --> 5790.179
and I wonder if that's even still

5787.719 --> 5791.86
I think I could probably just say it

5790.179 --> 5794.139
again

5791.86 --> 5798.599999999999
but now I've gotten used to saying it

5794.139 --> 5798.6
like that and so yeah I

5801.04 --> 5807.159
maybe I'll start like once things are

5804.94 --> 5809.879999999999
really over I'll start just calling in

5807.159 --> 5809.879999999999
what it is again

5815.199 --> 5819.4
but yeah I decided to do that just to

5817.54 --> 5822.46
keep my channel safe you know I did get

5819.4 --> 5825.239
a strike that one time it's still marked

5822.46 --> 5825.2390000000005
on my channel

5825.28 --> 5830.08
and they're not taking that away so I'm

5828.1 --> 5833.02
just gonna keep on doing that because I

5830.08 --> 5835.54
don't want to lose the channel and

5833.02 --> 5838.06
but for the rest I've been just openly

5835.54 --> 5840.84
talking about talking about it pretty

5838.06 --> 5840.84
much all the time

5840.88 --> 5847.139
medical stuff

5843.94 --> 5847.138999999999
in my insights

5863.5 --> 5868.42
wow look at Lydia locks doing his Smurf

5866.5 --> 5871.08
off

5868.42 --> 5871.08
damn

5877.48 --> 5882.159
they're getting very close though it's

5880.239 --> 5883.718999999999
like she basically described the

5882.159 --> 5885.78
scientific method

5883.719 --> 5888.1
except

5885.78 --> 5890.92
slightly different

5888.1 --> 5895.3
so if you're really lenient you could

5890.92 --> 5899.38
literally read what she said at 2050 as

5895.3 --> 5901.6
being correct except it's not really so

5899.38 --> 5903.84
she's being a very serious Smurf about

5901.6 --> 5903.84
it

5904.54 --> 5908.4
she's being really Smurfy

5912.4 --> 5916.92
yeah I'm gone now I'm gonna call you

5914.32 --> 5916.92
logs

5920.04 --> 5923.34
I'm sorry

5923.44 --> 5927.36
that was decided long ago

5930.46 --> 5935.56
because yeah Lydia log sometimes she

5932.8 --> 5938.6990000000005
talked yeah you can talk [ __ ] so I'm

5935.56 --> 5938.6990000000005
gonna call you logs

5943.119 --> 5947.58
that's how I read it for some reason

5945.219 --> 5947.58
anyway

5951.51 --> 5955.039000000001
[Music]

5958.179 --> 5963.28
so what is science ah yeah the science

5961.239 --> 5965.0199999999995
is a method

5963.28 --> 5966.5199999999995
to establish

5965.02 --> 5970.3
cause

5966.52 --> 5973.06
of an effect which has to be a naturally

5970.3 --> 5976.54
occurring phenomenon

5973.06 --> 5978.159000000001
that can be varied a manipulator by the

5976.54 --> 5980.98
experimenter

5978.159 --> 5983.759999999999
again in order to call to establish the

5980.98 --> 5983.759999999999
cause of the effect

5983.86 --> 5987.88
and

5985.119 --> 5989.739
there's always going to be a result of

5987.88 --> 5992.56
this experiment

5989.739 --> 5995.199
because either you prove

5992.56 --> 5997.6
or you disprove with the null

5995.199 --> 6000.54
the hypothesis you either prove or

5997.6 --> 6003.119000000001
disprove the cause of the effect through

6000.54 --> 6005.6
the manipulation the independent

6003.119 --> 6005.599999999999
variable

6005.9 --> 6012.299999999999
that's science

6009.119 --> 6017.36
in even the slightest deviation of that

6012.3 --> 6017.360000000001
exact structure is not science

6020.36 --> 6026.8099999999995
do you think it is you're a Smurf

6023.61 --> 6026.8099999999995
[Music]

6068.639 --> 6072.5
all right Lydia did you get all that

6085.679 --> 6091.28
you can do signs on non-natural stuff

6092.219 --> 6098.219
now not technically or the the problem

6095.82 --> 6100.139
is that what natural really even stands

6098.219 --> 6101.1
for is not even the nature of the

6100.139 --> 6103.02
substance

6101.1 --> 6105.659000000001
it stands for the

6103.02 --> 6107.6990000000005
the critical difference as in naturally

6105.659 --> 6109.799999999999
occurring so it's not even like natural

6107.699 --> 6111.36
in a more colloquial sense it's

6109.8 --> 6114.4800000000005
naturally occurring

6111.36 --> 6117.119
it has to exist outside of something

6114.48 --> 6121.159
that you as a person make

6117.119 --> 6121.159
has to be a natural effect

6121.44 --> 6127.44
in contrast to a man-made effect

6124.739 --> 6129.839999999999
in the man-made device that's what that

6127.44 --> 6132.839999999999
nature is all about

6129.84 --> 6135.84
right the supernatural

6132.84 --> 6138.96
exists

6135.84 --> 6142.52
like through us you don't have to

6138.96 --> 6142.52
necessarily construct it

6143.76 --> 6150.84
because it's just part of nature it's

6148.02 --> 6152.159000000001
part of the design of everything

6150.84 --> 6154.619000000001
uh

6152.159 --> 6159.86
I might be wandering off a little it is

6154.619 --> 6159.86
a technical load but I do know that yeah

6160.139 --> 6167.6990000000005
the supernatural as in information

6163.86 --> 6171.36
is the substance of information

6167.699 --> 6174.199
can actually be worked with in the

6171.36 --> 6174.199
scientific method

6176.46 --> 6182.9
it would be classified as the nowhere

6179.639 --> 6182.900000000001
within that experiment

6191.1 --> 6195.38
or knowing which path which is an

6194.04 --> 6198.179
information

6195.38 --> 6202.28
indication right so it is Supernatural

6198.179 --> 6202.28
it can be very manipulated

6205.08 --> 6209.58
and

6207.48 --> 6212.099999999999
yeah there's the thing can it exists

6209.58 --> 6214.38
outside of man-made devices

6212.1 --> 6217.38
right but these are actually good

6214.38 --> 6219.900000000001
inquiries like that's something you can

6217.38 --> 6223.679
add QE about and then you'll get very

6219.9 --> 6226.679
triggered very loud and then maybe after

6223.679 --> 6230.84
50 minutes of rambling and shouting and

6226.679 --> 6230.84
calling you a numpty or whatever

6231.3 --> 6237.360000000001
he might actually

6233.639 --> 6240.0
put down some details about why or if

6237.36 --> 6242.28
he's in a really good mood then not

6240.0 --> 6245.36
Ramble On for 15 minutes and just give

6242.28 --> 6245.36
you the straight out answer

6246.659 --> 6252.599999999999
because he does know a lot about it

6249.659 --> 6256.739
right but yeah

6252.6 --> 6259.56
it is worth pondering upon because maybe

6256.739 --> 6261.419999999999
the Supernatural is technically not

6259.56 --> 6263.96
really suitable for the scientific

6261.42 --> 6263.96
method

6265.38 --> 6267.9800000000005
Maybe

6268.619 --> 6273.78
I mean

6271.199 --> 6276.0
it is Supernatural after all but yeah

6273.78 --> 6278.099999999999
it's this just gets it it gets a little

6276.0 --> 6280.8
complicated I'm pretty sure that it's

6278.1 --> 6282.96
been worked out

6280.8 --> 6285.659000000001
in the tail and

6282.96 --> 6287.94
QE does very much insist that it falls

6285.659 --> 6291.42
under Natural Science and he probably

6287.94 --> 6295.0199999999995
worked out a very good reason for that

6291.42 --> 6297.42
he's not just gonna assert something

6295.02 --> 6300.3
on the surface like that

6297.42 --> 6303.0
right but yeah I do not know enough

6300.3 --> 6306.179
about it exactly

6303.0 --> 6308.52
I even have my doubts about Quantum

6306.179 --> 6311.34
experiments in general like I have my

6308.52 --> 6314.400000000001
doubts but I've never actually in person

6311.34 --> 6316.679
in person physically witnessed and

6314.4 --> 6318.9
tested it

6316.679 --> 6320.82
but it's basically a giant rumor to me

6318.9 --> 6324.179
I've never seen any demonstration I've

6320.82 --> 6326.88
seen a lot of demonstrations I've never

6324.179 --> 6330.06
seen any kind of in the room

6326.88 --> 6332.58
demonstration of the knowing witch path

6330.06 --> 6334.679
experiment I've never seen it

6332.58 --> 6337.08
so that's kind of where my expertise

6334.679 --> 6339.2390000000005
just completely halts

6337.08 --> 6342.36
and I have another approach model that

6339.239 --> 6345.839999999999
I've even figured out for light like a

6342.36 --> 6348.679
completely different Ultra route for the

6345.84 --> 6348.679
entire structure

6350.159 --> 6355.199
so

6352.56 --> 6357.719
right anyway I'm gonna run out the show

6355.199 --> 6359.58
