Steve Amanda young son monkey 3d then

132.09 --> 144.9
Winfield w del West Watson I'm over moco

140.299 --> 150.84
Michael be crazy

144.9 --> 162.739
cutie Lottie says Karen be ya good to

150.84 --> 166.47
see you all I'm doing pretty good

162.739 --> 169.31900000000002
concerning the circumstances as pretty

166.47 --> 172.68
much been waiting for money to come in

169.319 --> 174.95899999999997
and been living off scraps the entire

172.68 --> 176.549
weekend I really didn't say yet and I'm

174.959 --> 177.75
just waiting for my money to come in

176.549 --> 180.6
because it's supposed to come in today

177.75 --> 185.299
and I really would like to eat some eggs

180.6 --> 189.019
again because I haven't had ate any

185.299 --> 195.0
serious protein based food in

189.019 --> 198.359
two-and-a-half days now so yeah but I'm

195.0 --> 199.859
still managing it does seem like I have

198.359 --> 201.359
to be a little bit more careful with

199.859 --> 208.109
what I do is especially concerning

201.359 --> 210.69
smoking but yeah but just get a good

208.109 --> 213.78
meal this evening that that would fix

210.69 --> 216.9
everything pretty much and at least I

213.78 --> 219.389
still got fish oil supplements and all

216.9 --> 223.06900000000002
that and the funny thing is if I take

219.389 --> 228.56900000000002
that then I can take a lot including

223.069 --> 231.14999999999998
eating very little so I'll sit through

228.569 --> 236.819
it I'm just seeing it as a sort of

231.15 --> 239.61
fasting and I do eat stuff though but

236.819 --> 245.13
it's more like sandwich with

239.61 --> 249.60000000000002
and mustard and pieces of lettuce on it

245.13 --> 251.67
and yeah that that's fine you know it's

249.6 --> 255.15
just not the baked eggs with mayonnaise

251.67 --> 259.83
that I'm used to which is fair Eve much

255.15 --> 262.22
richer in fat and protein but yeah it's

259.83 --> 262.21999999999997
doable

267.22 --> 274.21000000000004
yeah and funnily enough also been doing

269.95 --> 277.83
some exercises here and there and that

274.21 --> 277.83
seems to be working out fine

287.02 --> 293.39
all right Amanda young thank you for

290.72 --> 296.36
that didn't thought that was necessary

293.39 --> 299.06
but yeah any news on the globe lied to

296.36 --> 304.52000000000004
her well yeah I have been watching from

299.06 --> 309.8
sidelines in the globe light tour jet

304.52 --> 314.47999999999996
and Skype and Roxanne has been sharing a

309.8 --> 319.94
lot of like quick shot videos of what

314.48 --> 321.17
they're working on the bus I don't know

319.94 --> 325.46
what they're doing they're updating it

321.17 --> 328.40000000000003
to be fair I haven't been like blog

325.46 --> 331.78
following it all but I have been keeping

328.4 --> 331.78
a look from the sidelines

379.299 --> 386.269
for [ __ ] sake stupid mute button again

382.909 --> 390.109
I hate it when is that does that I click

386.269 --> 393.999
it but it doesn't go off and then don't

390.109 --> 393.99899999999997
take notice of it that's just great

395.229 --> 406.219
yes flat soit fe I do trim my mustache

398.209 --> 408.139
or it's gonna be a wild Bush don't know

406.219 --> 411.009
why you would ask these questions but

408.139 --> 411.009
whatever

411.699 --> 421.519
by the way Karen be uh how about the

416.569 --> 424.66900000000004
whole conference situation next Friday

421.519 --> 427.819
and Saturday because I don't know some

424.669 --> 432.36899999999997
people and Chad were saying that we're

427.819 --> 436.279
like you and Randy and me are sharing a

432.369 --> 437.899
what is it a cabin now I have no idea

436.279 --> 442.279
what's been happening I haven't had any

437.899 --> 444.679
response from from Adam yet who I was

442.279 --> 447.229
who was about yeah he invited me to his

444.679 --> 450.289
cabin so I wonder if there was anything

447.229 --> 455.949
to that or is just nonsense troll rumors

450.289 --> 455.949
everybody's misreading Karen

475.29 --> 483.45000000000005
well Dell West Watson I rarely do I

478.56 --> 494.88
usually only do that in female company

483.45 --> 498.96
Oh God okay okay Karen B yeah I wanted

494.88 --> 501.21
to know did you hear anything about the

498.96 --> 504.18
sleeping arrangements as it were for

501.21 --> 507.84
Friday night because I got some weird

504.18 --> 510.0
saying from people in chat and could it

507.84 --> 512.79
could have just been trolling or like

510.0 --> 514.26
other people trolling them and they yeah

512.79 --> 522.63
we're silly enough to just take it

514.26 --> 525.95
outright that you and me and and and

522.63 --> 530.07
Randi supposedly we're now sharing a a

525.95 --> 532.5200000000001
what is it a cabin I have no idea what

530.07 --> 532.5200000000001
that was about

533.63 --> 540.29
is that just nonsense rumors or they

536.73 --> 543.5
have such things like been rearranged

540.29 --> 543.5
[Music]

550.39 --> 558.6999999999999
no not in one bed cabin it's ridiculous

559.66 --> 563.4499999999999
right

561.02 --> 571.6999999999999
okay thank you so it was just typical

563.45 --> 574.58
nonsense rumors and I thought so it's

571.7 --> 577.7
weird it you know Karen sometimes it

574.58 --> 580.1600000000001
really feels like a lot of while the

577.7 --> 582.23
followers even Flat Earth but the more

580.16 --> 585.38
trollish people sometimes seem to treat

582.23 --> 587.09
us like we're like we're part of the Big

585.38 --> 588.14
Brother show or something it is really

587.09 --> 592.0400000000001
weird

588.14 --> 595.73
like oh yeah we want to match them off

592.04 --> 598.01
and have a romance life that I don't

595.73 --> 602.59
know why everybody tries to push that

598.01 --> 602.59
nonsense it's actually kind of annoying

607.96 --> 612.0400000000001
you know if it happens it happens

614.17 --> 626.2299999999999
because they are losers maybe or maybe

622.79 --> 630.26
they're just lonely and they they want

626.23 --> 632.98
yeah you know just like I don't know in

630.26 --> 638.5
the old days when you were really lonely

632.98 --> 641.15
you would read books and and lived

638.5 --> 644.09
relationships through characters that

641.15 --> 647.03
you read about so this is kind of the

644.09 --> 650.8100000000001
same thing but a more interactive visual

647.03 --> 653.06
medium I don't think it's that pathetic

650.81 --> 656.7399999999999
it is pathetic though if you're going to

653.06 --> 656.7399999999999
obsess over that constantly

667.459 --> 676.38
well Karen B in a way it is a game only

672.0 --> 678.0
the stakes are different for for the

676.38 --> 681.6899999999999
involved parties the stakes are very

678.0 --> 683.459
different for us compared to those the

681.69 --> 686.19
viewers and the onlookers and the

683.459 --> 690.7199999999999
anonymous trolls their stakes are much

686.19 --> 692.7
lower they don't have a direct necessity

690.72 --> 696.51
to take it seriously oh by the way thank

692.7 --> 699.63
you she endures for the $2 super chat

696.51 --> 703.43
donation I was gonna give more but you

699.63 --> 708.39
time me out I don't give a [ __ ] if

703.43 --> 710.1899999999999
you're gonna give me anything then yeah

708.39 --> 713.37
I do it by paypal or it's not really

710.19 --> 728.49
gonna matter a lot anyway but thank you

713.37 --> 730.649
she honors $2 sauce is fine well I

728.49 --> 733.26
understand that Karen B but people are

730.649 --> 735.6
gonna take you for entertainment purpose

733.26 --> 738.209
nevertheless unfortunately whether you

735.6 --> 740.399
like it or not as they do with me it's

738.209 --> 744.75
up to you as to how much you feed into

740.399 --> 748.35
that and in what way look I see it as

744.75 --> 751.399
and I hope you take this to heart but

748.35 --> 754.11
it's like I don't want this to be like a

751.399 --> 755.7
clown show to a lot of people that don't

754.11 --> 757.86
get it that are just seeing this is

755.7 --> 761.07
entertainment unfortunately there's no

757.86 --> 763.23
way to prevent this you can ignore it

761.07 --> 765.45
doesn't make it go away actually that

763.23 --> 768.029
makes it more dangerous because if you

765.45 --> 771.1800000000001
ignore it then it'll start to live a

768.029 --> 775.61
life of its own you have no control so

771.18 --> 775.6099999999999
what I recommend personally is you

775.7 --> 785.6600000000001
basically railroad where it's gonna go

781.16 --> 785.66
it's in a way what I'm trying to do

787.62 --> 797.26
your hand the the people something to

794.26 --> 803.4399999999999
chew on and you decide what that thing

797.26 --> 811.18
is and figure out what the long-term

803.44 --> 814.1500000000001
result will be that's the best way to

811.18 --> 817.89
play it in my in my personal opinion and

814.15 --> 822.34
yeah that you that way you have a

817.89 --> 824.88
framework within which you can actually

822.34 --> 827.19
get to the serious business you like

824.88 --> 829.57
because you don't have to worry about

827.19 --> 833.2
trolls getting out of control because

829.57 --> 840.46
you've given them the direction they're

833.2 --> 841.72
gonna grow in cuz you yeah you didn't

840.46 --> 846.22
leave it to chance

841.72 --> 848.86
that that thing and now operating like

846.22 --> 852.64
this is you have to think it through

848.86 --> 856.23
very carefully some people are very good

852.64 --> 859.0
at it subconsciously I think I may have

856.23 --> 860.77
gained a knack for it as well because it

859.0 --> 862.66
seems to be good automated with me but

860.77 --> 866.0799999999999
I'm very aware of it I think it stems

862.66 --> 870.31
from just being constantly looked at by

866.08 --> 873.87
source of people in in a bad way even

870.31 --> 877.78
like I was exposed to that younger

873.87 --> 879.61
ohright would take basically what in

877.78 --> 884.23
retrospect turn out to be outrageous

879.61 --> 886.15
positions in arguments that I didn't

884.23 --> 889.9200000000001
think we're outrageous just a little on

886.15 --> 892.66
the edge and that makes everyone

889.92 --> 896.11
certainly be extremely suspicious of you

892.66 --> 897.91
think you are insane or evil and then

896.11 --> 901.54
from that point on they'll be looking

897.91 --> 904.66
and they will be fishing so if you then

901.54 --> 906.75
I suffered under that enormous Lee

904.66 --> 909.24
because I tried to get out I tried to

906.75 --> 911.59
bargain with like can you please stop

909.24 --> 914.2
look I'm trying to explain what happened

911.59 --> 917.74
it's not that bad okay and they just

914.2 --> 921.36
didn't care so then I had no choice but

917.74 --> 926.589
to either just soak sulk through

921.36 --> 932.6800000000001
or actually start to hand them specific

926.589 --> 935.7090000000001
weird things beside what they would

932.68 --> 939.6099999999999
dwell upon about me instead of leaving

935.709 --> 943.93
it by chance and that really worked

939.61 --> 947.73
fantastically you know one of the things

943.93 --> 951.0999999999999
was yeah yeah they love to make

947.73 --> 954.189
ridiculing songs about me and it was

951.1 --> 957.49
extremely aggravating to sit through

954.189 --> 959.829
that and that really one wasn't one of

957.49 --> 961.36
the more insufferable things I had to

959.829 --> 963.579
sit through where they literally

961.36 --> 965.439
everybody would jump into that as a peer

963.579 --> 967.689
pressure thing it's just a moment and

965.439 --> 971.17
terrible even teachers couldn't stop it

967.689 --> 975.819
so what I did is I started to make my

971.17 --> 977.259
own songs my own ridiculing songs I kind

975.819 --> 981.279
of switched it around and guess what

977.259 --> 985.389
happened when I started to sing in the

981.279 --> 988.62
group proudly everybody stopped and

985.389 --> 988.62
never did it again

989.97 --> 996.73
so yeah I'm used to this kind of [ __ ]

993.689 --> 1003.709
that's the weird thing I've I've had

996.73 --> 1006.1800000000001
like pretty heavy ridiculing training

1003.709 --> 1009.2589999999999
psychological warfare training in my

1006.18 --> 1009.2589999999999
preteen time

1013.46 --> 1022.1
right I understand Karen B you choose to

1018.68 --> 1024.589
ignore it but the thing is everyone else

1022.1 --> 1026.72
is gonna hear it and if you ignore it

1024.589 --> 1029.48
then you're gonna be the only you're

1026.72 --> 1031.939
gonna have to be you're gonna be just

1029.48 --> 1037.88
say no it's [ __ ] no this isn't true

1031.939 --> 1041.3600000000001
no this is true to everyone everyone so

1037.88 --> 1043.25
you can do that if you don't mind but

1041.36 --> 1046.01
it's not gonna stop it just so you know

1043.25 --> 1050.03
that strategy ignoring it isn't gonna

1046.01 --> 1053.15
stop it it's gonna persist pretty much

1050.03 --> 1058.58
for as long as you do that and do things

1053.15 --> 1064.76
on YouTube until you take the reigns of

1058.58 --> 1069.1699999999998
it anyway it's up to you you know if you

1064.76 --> 1072.53
want to talk maybe about this we can do

1069.17 --> 1074.54
that next Saturday or Friday if anybody

1072.53 --> 1076.97
even wants to talk about any anything

1074.54 --> 1078.559
serious or just goof around I have no

1076.97 --> 1086.929
idea what it's what it's gonna be like

1078.559 --> 1092.57
Friday Friday evening but yeah I have

1086.929 --> 1094.67
tips for lots of people and I bet lots

1092.57 --> 1103.79
of people have tips for me they seem to

1094.67 --> 1107.179
have that so yeah the issue really was

1103.79 --> 1109.67
always that was I mentally ready for

1107.179 --> 1112.16
that that's usually the issue with me

1109.67 --> 1116.0
you know I have this weird mode wherein

1112.16 --> 1119.24
certain yeah I have the brace mode where

1116.0 --> 1121.88
I'm basically very inflexible and are

1119.24 --> 1124.13
just gonna say no pretty much any tip

1121.88 --> 1126.2600000000002
because I can't handle change at such a

1124.13 --> 1128.0300000000002
moment even though I should because

1126.26 --> 1129.65
there's like an opportunity it's really

1128.03 --> 1131.3899999999999
counterproductive and annoying that I

1129.65 --> 1134.0300000000002
have that it just happens and then

1131.39 --> 1136.8200000000002
eventually I break out of it and then

1134.03 --> 1141.17
suddenly I'm literally up for anything

1136.82 --> 1143.6899999999998
almost and I think I might be reaching

1141.17 --> 1145.3200000000002
that as I basically opened the door

1143.69 --> 1149.49
again to

1145.32 --> 1152.97
must find a more viable financial career

1149.49 --> 1155.58
somehow I must either radically shift

1152.97 --> 1161.6100000000001
things around here that it does become a

1155.58 --> 1167.3999999999999
serious self-sustaining thing where I

1161.61 --> 1169.29
can live of it and and grow or yeah a

1167.4 --> 1171.39
career outside of that and maybe this on

1169.29 --> 1175.1399999999999
the side but I've pretty much been

1171.39 --> 1177.51
forced to do that so I am I've been

1175.14 --> 1180.72
mentally preparing myself for two weeks

1177.51 --> 1184.62
at least and it changes everything it's

1180.72 --> 1186.48
weird like even the way my body responds

1184.62 --> 1188.79
to smoking a joint for example is now

1186.48 --> 1191.31
different because of this it's so weird

1188.79 --> 1194.9099999999999
to remember that even because that's

1191.31 --> 1197.6399999999999
happened before and in the past and I'm

1194.91 --> 1200.1000000000001
talking about right after my 20s I made

1197.64 --> 1202.26
some stupid mistakes with that that is

1200.1 --> 1204.9299999999998
that as I was basically preparing for

1202.26 --> 1207.42
like a new job I would start smoking

1204.93 --> 1210.98
then got totally dizzy from that [ __ ]

1207.42 --> 1214.68
that's very weird and then I let that

1210.98 --> 1217.04
basically disrupt me so that I wasn't

1214.68 --> 1223.17
ready for the job that was really

1217.04 --> 1226.98
annoying that I did that was yeah but

1223.17 --> 1229.3200000000002
it's like I don't know everybody's just

1226.98 --> 1231.39
saying he just has problems because he

1229.32 --> 1233.6399999999999
seems to be sabotaging himself and I

1231.39 --> 1239.49
know how that happened why it's just

1233.64 --> 1241.3200000000002
poor self-management so but that [ __ ]

1239.49 --> 1243.42
I'm not gonna let make those mistakes

1241.32 --> 1246.8
again because I know now exactly I

1243.42 --> 1250.3700000000001
figured out over time how that works how

1246.8 --> 1252.8999999999999
the metabolism actually changes with the

1250.37 --> 1255.0
the amount of tension you're building

1252.9 --> 1256.92
with whatever you're preparing for

1255.0 --> 1260.01
everything changes the way you respond

1256.92 --> 1263.3400000000001
to food the way you respond to smoking

1260.01 --> 1265.83
anything it all changes with it and if

1263.34 --> 1268.83
you're not careful then you can actually

1265.83 --> 1270.8999999999999
disrupt your own cycle with drugs this

1268.83 --> 1273.3799999999999
is the most dangerous thing about drugs

1270.9 --> 1275.8500000000001
is that they disrupt like your energy

1273.38 --> 1277.6200000000001
preparation cycles you know when you're

1275.85 --> 1278.74
on a vacation or whatever you have a

1277.62 --> 1280.75
certain times

1278.74 --> 1284.2
and it doesn't really matter that much

1280.75 --> 1287.11
and that's fine if you have a complete

1284.2 --> 1290.05
grip and can quit and everything but

1287.11 --> 1294.4799999999998
when you're like very active doing a lot

1290.05 --> 1297.55
of heavy things like new jobs or

1294.48 --> 1300.22
expanding something trying difficult new

1297.55 --> 1304.1499999999999
stuff yeah drugs any sort of drugs

1300.22 --> 1307.75
probably maybe not tobacco as much but

1304.15 --> 1312.7
most other drugs will disrupt the energy

1307.75 --> 1317.47
cycle that you use that is necessary to

1312.7 --> 1320.98
perform adequately under the more

1317.47 --> 1324.73
serious situations and that is just

1320.98 --> 1326.679
something that I realize so in

1324.73 --> 1329.4
retrospect if I'm ever going to be at

1326.679 --> 1332.65
some point where I do have a lot of

1329.4 --> 1335.0500000000002
serious things to do and I can muster it

1332.65 --> 1342.7900000000002
then I'm probably even gonna lay off

1335.05 --> 1345.01
most most things entirely but I get that

1342.79 --> 1347.02
would be satisfying anyway because I'd

1345.01 --> 1350.35
be dedicating a lot of time and energy

1347.02 --> 1354.04
in doing something constructive so I

1350.35 --> 1359.23
wouldn't even need I wouldn't have urges

1354.04 --> 1360.54
that much yeah anyway a lot of meta talk

1359.23 --> 1363.1
here

1360.54 --> 1366.57
no proficient pirate you're not blocked

1363.1 --> 1366.57
it's a stupid thing to say

1381.94 --> 1391.0
nope no fireworks you know I used to

1387.67 --> 1393.25
love fireworks I don't I well I don't as

1391.0 --> 1395.02
much anymore and I just don't have the

1393.25 --> 1398.38
money for that [ __ ] and it really just

1395.02 --> 1400.44
kind of pollutes everything anyway no

1398.38 --> 1403.39
they don't

1400.44 --> 1406.14
though they don't proficient pirate why

1403.39 --> 1409.9
don't you actually look in the youtubes

1406.14 --> 1412.42
right look in the chat over there your

1409.9 --> 1416.1100000000001
messages are right there so whatever is

1412.42 --> 1418.39
causing your messages to disappear in

1416.11 --> 1420.1899999999998
your interface that is your interface

1418.39 --> 1428.8600000000001
issues because it's right there it's not

1420.19 --> 1430.93
disappearing oh now the plain truth I

1428.86 --> 1433.6499999999999
haven't seen your ether band tutorial

1430.93 --> 1433.65
with no idea

1434.19 --> 1438.229
[Music]

1440.58 --> 1451.3799999999999
Oh proficient pirate yeah oh oh you

1445.65 --> 1453.69
wanted to do that are you yeah there are

1451.38 --> 1457.41
certain words or actually there's one

1453.69 --> 1460.1000000000001
very specific word that is banned so if

1457.41 --> 1463.89
you wanted to put things out about that

1460.1 --> 1465.7199999999998
yeah that didn't work and if you're

1463.89 --> 1471.17
gonna try to do that in some other way

1465.72 --> 1471.17
I'm gonna ban you just so you know

1480.15 --> 1489.66
now I'm not gonna address it because

1485.23 --> 1493.33
such subjects for whatever reason

1489.66 --> 1496.929
involving people here on YouTube will

1493.33 --> 1499.299
not be brought up here unless they are

1496.929 --> 1503.2
literally in the middle of being

1499.299 --> 1505.69
convicted it's very simple you got it

1503.2 --> 1507.94
you don't bring it up you don't talk

1505.69 --> 1523.8700000000001
about it you don't spread rumors or your

1507.94 --> 1529.3300000000002
band okay is that clear everyone okay

1523.87 --> 1532.57
hello Mario M thanks but my voice does

1529.33 --> 1534.6999999999998
not sound like Martin eta at all and I

1532.57 --> 1540.299
don't look like him at all either

1534.7 --> 1543.63
so don't know where you're from but no

1540.299 --> 1543.6299999999999
just know

1544.5 --> 1547.71
[Music]

1560.61 --> 1563.7099999999998
right

1561.76 --> 1566.02
well proficient pirate I don't give a

1563.71 --> 1568.51
[ __ ] as to what you think that has

1566.02 --> 1569.47
happened whatever context if you bring

1568.51 --> 1572.31
it up you're banned

1569.47 --> 1572.31
okay

1578.79 --> 1581.98
[Music]

1592.17 --> 1597.71
yeah it is it is goodbye

1616.059 --> 1624.219
it's I think it is disgusting you you

1621.099 --> 1627.4289999999999
know and I'm I'm I'm gonna be pretty

1624.219 --> 1631.779
rough here for a moment so sorry if this

1627.429 --> 1637.779
is gonna be offensive to anyone that I

1631.779 --> 1641.289
do actually care about but in general it

1637.779 --> 1645.899
was kind of known earlier or at least

1641.289 --> 1651.429
assumed in some way that if people have

1645.899 --> 1654.2489999999998
angst for for example homosexuals that

1651.429 --> 1656.769
that is or that there is a very serious

1654.249 --> 1660.94
likelihood that they are themselves are

1656.769 --> 1664.869
suppressing our sexual experience of

1660.94 --> 1667.21
feeling experiences and that that was

1664.869 --> 1671.279
that's like psychology related and there

1667.21 --> 1675.359
is some truth to it okay well guess what

1671.279 --> 1678.839
it's not the only thing that counts for

1675.359 --> 1684.58
you know what it also counts for people

1678.839 --> 1688.96
that obsess over transsexuals guess what

1684.58 --> 1694.499
what they're dealing with mm-hmm right

1688.96 --> 1696.6390000000001
and then people that obsess over a

1694.499 --> 1699.969
certain group of people that I don't

1696.639 --> 1703.589
like very much on record right well

1699.969 --> 1708.1490000000001
guess what they're dealing with okay

1703.589 --> 1712.749
okay think about it

1708.149 --> 1715.9499999999998
why do you dwell upon that sight upon

1712.749 --> 1722.1390000000001
that horrific image so much is that you

1715.95 --> 1725.219
know a sane person with a proper

1722.139 --> 1730.389
frequency and a stronghold of the soul

1725.219 --> 1734.979
would be disgusted walk away why they

1730.389 --> 1739.6789999999999
keep on looking huh why do you keep on

1734.979 --> 1742.929
looking there what is compelling you to

1739.679 --> 1746.2800000000002
to keep on dwelling on that think about

1742.929 --> 1757.8400000000001
it okay

1746.28 --> 1760.68
all right yeah

1757.84 --> 1760.6799999999998
take that dog

1762.53 --> 1768.18
[Music]

1774.53 --> 1782.48
[Music]

1783.82 --> 1790.81
you know how they say that if you fight

1786.52 --> 1794.05
a demon or a certain type of evil long

1790.81 --> 1798.21
enough you become it you know what that

1794.05 --> 1798.21
refers to everything I just said

1810.72 --> 1821.789
now but see judge meant for you I'm not

1816.309 --> 1825.8799999999999
telling people to walk away okay but

1821.789 --> 1829.51
spreading rumors and [ __ ] and obsessing

1825.88 --> 1832.72
over certain things that are disgusting

1829.51 --> 1836.82
and project that into everybody's mind

1832.72 --> 1842.95
by constantly talking about it non-stop

1836.82 --> 1846.309
that's not confronting it at all what it

1842.95 --> 1849.039
is is disgusting and nauseating and

1846.309 --> 1852.1299999999999
literally like spreading pictures of

1849.039 --> 1854.08
that [ __ ] everywhere it has quite an

1852.13 --> 1857.0800000000002
opposite effect really in my opinion

1854.08 --> 1860.1399999999999
what it does is it numbs everyone down

1857.08 --> 1862.99
it doesn't spur people to action

1860.14 --> 1865.8090000000002
it doesn't just burst people into hatred

1862.99 --> 1868.6
their self-defense the only thing you

1865.809 --> 1872.85
can not walk away from it is not by

1868.6 --> 1876.6399999999999
spamming the internet constantly with

1872.85 --> 1881.08
information that that is going on no it

1876.64 --> 1882.8500000000001
is actually targeting people that have

1881.08 --> 1886.27
really done it and then get judicial

1882.85 --> 1888.4599999999998
processes going or confronting people

1886.27 --> 1891.07
that are basically already convicted and

1888.46 --> 1894.82
all that [ __ ] and that are obviously

1891.07 --> 1896.59
being protected that is confronting it

1894.82 --> 1897.7
but guess what that's really difficult

1896.59 --> 1902.6499999999999
though isn't it

1897.7 --> 1904.45
so most people walk away most people

1902.65 --> 1907.9
walk away and people that talk about

1904.45 --> 1911.289
that [ __ ] constantly on the internet

1907.9 --> 1913.21
they're walking away too but they're not

1911.289 --> 1919.179
just walking away now they're walking

1913.21 --> 1922.27
away and they're making it more rough on

1919.179 --> 1925.45
everyone they're actually helping those

1922.27 --> 1931.6299999999999
disgusting people unwittingly to create

1925.45 --> 1934.059
a barrier in between because most people

1931.63 --> 1936.24
just think it's disgusting don't want to

1934.059 --> 1939.4289999999999
have anything to do with it and

1936.24 --> 1941.289
especially at superficial exposure who

1939.429 --> 1942.01
will simply start to disbelieve it

1941.289 --> 1945.19
entirely

1942.01 --> 1947.05
then when something real happens they

1945.19 --> 1949.18
have so much doubt that they'll just

1947.05 --> 1951.19
think oh this is probably for something

1949.18 --> 1953.0800000000002
else that's the result of constantly

1951.19 --> 1955.78
spamming that [ __ ] everywhere

1953.08 --> 1960.78
that's such an opposite effect of what

1955.78 --> 1960.78
these sarvagna idiots think that it has

1974.83 --> 1979.24
the only thing that works is actually

1976.899 --> 1981.07
taking action that's the only thing that

1979.24 --> 1984.789
actually encourages everyone when you

1981.07 --> 1986.4399999999998
see that people are being convicted that

1984.789 --> 1990.64
they are being taken down that they are

1986.44 --> 1994.1490000000001
being shamed not being secretly taken

1990.64 --> 1998.679
away to prevent humiliation that that's

1994.149 --> 2001.549
what really helps and that's very tough

1998.679 --> 2001.549
to achieve

2011.37 --> 2014.56
[Music]

2025.13 --> 2033.0390000000002
okay Randy's going light for some reason

2037.11 --> 2040.2199999999998
[Music]

2042.169 --> 2050.94
Phil black I think so not entirely sure

2047.329 --> 2056.52
don't really care that much but probably

2050.94 --> 2059.849
I think that Europe and England changed

2056.52 --> 2064.349
synchronized and America changes at a

2059.849 --> 2066.869
different time no judgement for you I

2064.349 --> 2072.179
don't think you'd need to do that at all

2066.869 --> 2075.51
if it's a real problem then get some

2072.179 --> 2081.3
actual proof and that's not somebody

2075.51 --> 2084.929
saying things that is something that

2081.3 --> 2088.9700000000003
actually yeah some cowbell basically

2084.929 --> 2091.409
because rumors spread like a disease

2088.97 --> 2096.6899999999996
that's actually a bad analogy they

2091.409 --> 2103.1400000000003
spread like gas within a container go

2096.69 --> 2105.7200000000003
everywhere and you know I don't know if

2103.14 --> 2109.44
what he said but even he could have just

2105.72 --> 2112.68
been dumb enough to kind of like say

2109.44 --> 2115.619
something slightly out of context as two

2112.68 --> 2117.99
people are probably hearing it some kind

2115.619 --> 2118.589
of weird left is virtual signal out of

2117.99 --> 2120.8999999999996
control

2118.589 --> 2124.2799999999997
could it be that perhaps that he said

2120.9 --> 2127.28
one time or did he actually do anything

2124.28 --> 2127.28
so

2131.88 --> 2140.59
yeah it's very simple

2136.83 --> 2143.35
bring cowbell or don't bring anything at

2140.59 --> 2146.23
all or or you will be banned because

2143.35 --> 2158.5499999999997
people that just spread rumors about

2146.23 --> 2163.68
that kind of [ __ ] not welcome here mmm

2158.55 --> 2163.6800000000003
no this is how you do that

2170.19 --> 2177.13
okay well look it's a hey who else wants

2175.54 --> 2180.61
to be banned okay

2177.13 --> 2183.55
I'm ready to pretty much ban anyone here

2180.61 --> 2190.1800000000003
without a wrench that is gonna whine on

2183.55 --> 2192.36
about this [ __ ] not this channel you got

2190.18 --> 2192.3599999999997
it

2199.81 --> 2205.69
if let's just say besides the word that

2202.96 --> 2208.0
is banned if if anybody even brings up

2205.69 --> 2216.43
his channel name you are instantly

2208.0 --> 2217.45
banned you get that this is not a flat

2216.43 --> 2219.91
earth debates yet

2217.45 --> 2223.6899999999996

2259.279 --> 2264.74
thing they don't allow Nathan's very

specific rant is very specific so is

2264.74 --> 2271.0099999999998

you're the disgusting people because

2279.71 --> 2295.539
you're obsessing over it and that says

someone maybe technical in nature and

2318.5 --> 2322.51
not just these disgusting rumors

2348.94 --> 2357.2000000000003
all right yeah I can see I did catch ran

apparently now his entire set of

2361.579 --> 2365.78
channels have been deleted yeah I did

2421.16 --> 2430.1499999999996
been destroyed so he kind of deserves a

2425.869 --> 2434.839

2448.13 --> 2451.3900000000003
apparently you didn't

2455.5 --> 2458.5
right

2471.87 --> 2477.42
let me see yeah I think I posted

2474.25 --> 2477.42
something somewhere

2491.05 --> 2494.219
[Music]

2497.54 --> 2503.79
right oh yeah it was kind of weird there

2502.619 --> 2507.56
was a new piece

2503.79 --> 2513.75
it was also completely rolled out on the

2507.56 --> 2515.91
on Infowars streams Mike Adams was also

2513.75 --> 2520.92
part of it and he made a very good

2515.91 --> 2524.3399999999997
article that it's basically talking

2520.92 --> 2526.8
about how Google AI it has a high

2524.34 --> 2529.8500000000004
nikolic quantum blah quantum blah blah

2526.8 --> 2532.92
blah but it's just very strong thing and

2529.85 --> 2536.19
they're predicting that literally it

2532.92 --> 2538.8
will outdo any encryption like instantly

2536.19 --> 2541.25
and that's a big problem so it's as I

2538.8 --> 2544.86
kind of predicted years ago that

2541.25 --> 2548.85
everything ever you've ever done on the

2544.86 --> 2550.86
Internet ever encrypted not encrypted

2548.85 --> 2555.02
it's all gonna be known all of it

2550.86 --> 2555.02
there's literally nothing you can do

2555.17 --> 2561.9300000000003
that can prevent everything you ever

2557.79 --> 2564.48
done relating to being near some kind of

2561.93 --> 2567.44
electronic device it's all gonna be on

2564.48 --> 2567.44
record all of it

2569.18 --> 2577.71
so and this is basically saying yeah

2575.13 --> 2584.4
that's exactly what it I what it is what

2577.71 --> 2588.9900000000002
it's going to be and I was yeah I was

2584.4 --> 2592.1600000000003
counting on it and counting on that for

2588.99 --> 2592.16
for over a decade

2593.53 --> 2596.6690000000003
[Music]

2598.029 --> 2606.559
so something to consider everything

2600.71 --> 2609.799
you've ever done and of course there is

2606.559 --> 2612.1400000000003
gonna be like an average so everything

2609.799 --> 2613.88
ever done there's gonna be an average

2612.14 --> 2615.74
and it's gonna be pretty low because

2613.88 --> 2617.869
there are people out there they're just

2615.74 --> 2620.299
totally out of control that gets so

2617.869 --> 2622.819
idiotic and disgusting and insane

2620.299 --> 2625.7889999999998
not even for malicious reasons but they

2622.819 --> 2628.94
just are totally out of control that the

2625.789 --> 2632.829
average gonna be taken pretty low but

2628.94 --> 2635.4500000000003
then again it all depends on who is

2632.829 --> 2639.1600000000003
enforcing a standard so that could at

2635.45 --> 2643.64
some point just radically change around

2639.16 --> 2645.41
and that people that are actually

2643.64 --> 2647.5
behaving bad are suddenly going to be

2645.41 --> 2651.47
very seriously crack down upon

2647.5 --> 2655.279
potentially bureaucratically in a in a

2651.47 --> 2658.549
other way it is like instead of this

2655.279 --> 2664.539
nonsense leftism shame ISM self-destruct

2658.549 --> 2670.4
ISM it would be a more Trotskyite type

2664.539 --> 2673.6400000000003
yeah enforcing relative standards but at

2670.4 --> 2677.9300000000003
the same time corrupted will corrupt so

2673.64 --> 2681.49
badly so that could happen at some point

2677.93 --> 2681.49
just warning yeah

2690.47 --> 2699.24
okay well that's a contradiction they're

2695.46 --> 2701.76
super curved if Mike Adams was an idiot

2699.24 --> 2706.6499999999996
then he wouldn't have made money from

2701.76 --> 2709.38
some pogs scam if you say that he is

2706.65 --> 2712.17
kind of devious and that he's done some

2709.38 --> 2714.1800000000003
bad things that are not very moral well

2712.17 --> 2720.08
maybe you're right but that's not being

2714.18 --> 2723.5699999999997
an idiot it's just being kind of well

2720.08 --> 2725.97
bit dishonorable you could say it right

2723.57 --> 2728.46
like Alex Jones has done plenty

2725.97 --> 2730.5
well maybe Mike Adams has done something

2728.46 --> 2733.14
like that I wouldn't know I wouldn't

2730.5 --> 2734.91
really care too much what I care for is

2733.14 --> 2737.94
the quality of the information he puts

2734.91 --> 2741.89
out on any subject and then yeah he also

2737.94 --> 2745.26
does detailed [ __ ] on the globe and a

2741.89 --> 2747.9
global cosmology and all that he's a

2745.26 --> 2750.84
huge fan of it apparently he's kind of

2747.9 --> 2752.94
good at talking about it but yeah I

2750.84 --> 2757.17
don't really care for that I carry on

2752.94 --> 2759.36
his medical related expertise and more

2757.17 --> 2764.03
down to earth technology things because

2759.36 --> 2768.77
he's very smart at it in very research

2764.03 --> 2768.77
so he's definitely not an idiot

2787.71 --> 2812.5
yeah goodbye goodbye see you later and

2794.13 --> 2814.3
whatever YouTube is acting weird I just

2812.5 --> 2816.94
can't take these people it's like all

2814.3 --> 2819.61
the globus like all these people that

2816.94 --> 2823.42
are kind of like okay they all do this

2819.61 --> 2827.6400000000003
[ __ ] it's just it's just a default it

2823.42 --> 2832.03
seems for glowers to just slander anyone

2827.64 --> 2833.0099999999998
including their own priesthood one

2832.03 --> 2836.13
another

2833.01 --> 2838.57
it's just slander everyone it seems

2836.13 --> 2841.12
everyone is an idiot nobody's good

2838.57 --> 2844.4700000000003
enough everybody's wrong everyone it's

2841.12 --> 2844.47
just so ridiculous

2887.5 --> 2895.119
all right well feel blaka this is a chat

2891.55 --> 2898.3900000000003
on the internet if one was actually

2895.119 --> 2901.23
written on paper yeah that could be

2898.39 --> 2903.8489999999997
liable indeed that's the issue

2901.23 --> 2906.4900000000002
just like officially publicized or

2903.849 --> 2910.63
whatever put in a newspaper or such

2906.49 --> 2913.5989999999997
things you know but I don't know I

2910.63 --> 2915.58
consider everything on the internet more

2913.599 --> 2920.23
more like slander it is kind of word

2915.58 --> 2925.2
it's a digital word I don't know I don't

2920.23 --> 2928.03
know how it is even specifically defined

2925.2 --> 2933.0099999999998
yeah okay you say that you know what

2928.03 --> 2935.369
I'll ask Anthony that if it comes up

2933.01 --> 2935.369
again

2955.559 --> 2963.5190000000002
right that batch I don't know why that

2958.269 --> 2969.5089999999996
was deleted but it's not true so you

2963.519 --> 2973.049
don't even know seem to be plenty of

2969.509 --> 2976.059
Australians and New Zealanders at least

2973.049 --> 2980.7889999999998
these days that are into Flat Earth

2976.059 --> 2980.789
actively so how do you know

2990.88 --> 2996.2200000000003
because they're not darkstar they are

2994.06 --> 2998.35
not cherry-picking if you call anything

2996.22 --> 3003.54
that they do cherry-picking you're a

2998.35 --> 3006.93
[ __ ] it's not cherry-picking it's not

3003.54 --> 3009.39
a random statistical example within a

3006.93 --> 3012.75
wider thing that is taken out of context

3009.39 --> 3016.02
now there is it quote mining taking a

3012.75 --> 3017.97
single quote and picking something

3016.02 --> 3020.79
within that putting the whole thing out

3017.97 --> 3022.98
of context and neither is that so there

3020.79 --> 3024.75
is no cherry-picking going on there very

3022.98 --> 3027.14
careful to avoid that because they

3024.75 --> 3030.51
actually know what it is Darkstar

3027.14 --> 3034.0099999999998
they're not stupid unlike ballers that

3030.51 --> 3036.2400000000002
just can't get this they don't wanna

3034.01 --> 3042.4500000000003
doesn't work with their model with a

3036.24 --> 3044.75
dream so no cherry-picking not from them

3042.45 --> 3044.75
anyway

3050.65 --> 3053.84
[Music]

3057.98 --> 3061.86
[Music]

3063.89 --> 3066.89
yeah

3072.28 --> 3076.4500000000003
all right Phil black huh if you're gonna

3074.53 --> 3080.32
be a dick like that again next time

3076.45 --> 3084.46
you're just bad as I said I'm not shy to

3080.32 --> 3088.36
do this [ __ ] you know ballers in my chat

3084.46 --> 3093.04
are only as good as the knowledge they

3088.36 --> 3095.11
can provide and not as much as the size

3093.04 --> 3099.13
of the turds they leave behind okay

3095.11 --> 3104.1400000000003
that's not that's something that I don't

3099.13 --> 3108.4900000000002
want if you're gonna do that constantly

3104.14 --> 3112.0299999999997
then I'll just ban you provide ask

3108.49 --> 3114.87
questions good questions oh god they're

3112.03 --> 3114.8700000000003
drilling in the walls again

3128.44 --> 3133.9
now they down darkstar no they don't

3143.88 --> 3150.2400000000002
it's it's not cherry picking super curve

3147.15 --> 3153.78
they actually bring his full explanation

3150.24 --> 3158.52
into it you're an idiot it's not cherry

3153.78 --> 3160.52
picking you think they'd say something

3158.52 --> 3163.74
like that if at some other points

3160.52 --> 3167.52
Fineman would heavily contradict that or

3163.74 --> 3176.8799999999997
basically unravel the context of that at

3167.52 --> 3180.2
some point I think they bring it up no

3176.88 --> 3180.2000000000003
no he's not

3182.25 --> 3189.99
look the search for gravity goes on okay

3187.32 --> 3195.1800000000003
you know why because it hasn't been

3189.99 --> 3197.609
found yet not really it's just being now

3195.18 --> 3201.21
assumed to be other things as it was

3197.609 --> 3204.33
originally it's just a constant

3201.21 --> 3207.15
assumption migration that's what that's

3204.33 --> 3211.56
what gravity is and Fineman kind of got

3207.15 --> 3213.9300000000003
that he was taking I think like most

3211.56 --> 3216.63
people who look the whole thing about

3213.93 --> 3220.2599999999998
gravity again when I defended gravity is

3216.63 --> 3222.599
it is a mechanism that can sort of be

3220.26 --> 3225.9300000000003
taken as a natural law to oversimplify

3222.599 --> 3233.119
things this doesn't make it an actual

3225.93 --> 3233.1189999999997
thing it's just a tool to smoothen out

3233.33 --> 3239.16
system a system that's it to make it

3236.4 --> 3240.75
easier it doesn't make it real doesn't

3239.16 --> 3243.39
make it scientifically proven

3240.75 --> 3248.28
there was no hypothesis claims I

3243.39 --> 3255.72
understand did not even claim what

3248.28 --> 3260.6400000000003
gravity was in the physical world he

3255.72 --> 3262.589
never did that I think he gave a couple

3260.64 --> 3265.3799999999997
of answer that kind of deflected the

3262.589 --> 3268.7999999999997
question really by explaining how it

3265.38 --> 3274.9700000000003
influences things but that didn't really

3268.8 --> 3274.9700000000003
tie in the direct relationship so

3291.54 --> 3298.05
I'm just so sick of the shamelessness of

3294.609 --> 3298.0499999999997
the people here in Chad

3311.08 --> 3317.0499999999997
right Nico Nicholas Roberts

3314.67 --> 3321.2200000000003
you didn't need to do that in a manner

3317.05 --> 3322.9900000000002
young why would you erase a factual

3321.22 --> 3325.4199999999996
statement that's just wrong when it

3322.99 --> 3329.2299999999996
doesn't concern somebody else they want

3325.42 --> 3331.51
to make a technical mistake okay

3329.23 --> 3335.43
just let that make the technical mistake

3331.51 --> 3335.4300000000003
that's not a reason to delete something

3337.32 --> 3345.9100000000003
even though you just said something

3340.33 --> 3348.19
annoying with that acceleration yeah

3345.91 --> 3355.5899999999997
well you know what acceleration implies

3348.19 --> 3359.26
a force right so where exactly does

3355.59 --> 3361.09
Einstein's conceptualization depending

3359.26 --> 3364.3900000000003
of space-time where does that actually

3361.09 --> 3367.7200000000003
cause the force because that force is

3364.39 --> 3369.25
gravity right now we know that gravity

3367.72 --> 3373.99
is supposed to be the bending of

3369.25 --> 3379.78
space-time so we're how does that

3373.99 --> 3382.6899999999996
technically cause that force and why is

3379.78 --> 3386.53
there so much confusion about this on

3382.69 --> 3388.87
the ball or side it's not it's not us

3386.53 --> 3391.1800000000003
that is confused about this gravity

3388.87 --> 3399.58
being a force not a force in the parent

3391.18 --> 3404.5499999999997
force all that no ok so fix it why don't

3399.58 --> 3408.13
you fix it Fineman got all these things

3404.55 --> 3410.59
right but Fineman also likes to

3408.13 --> 3413.26
philosophize about things and he

3410.59 --> 3415.32
probably I haven't read the his lecture

3413.26 --> 3418.51
on gravity I'm pretty damn sure that

3415.32 --> 3424.3
quantum eraser has he's seen and read

3418.51 --> 3429.2400000000002
everything about it that's all right

3424.3 --> 3432.46
Amanda young you take care it's okay

3429.24 --> 3435.7
thanks for being here by the way and you

3432.46 --> 3439.63
know I do appreciate your at least

3435.7 --> 3442.6299999999997
trying to look out for my chat now we

3439.63 --> 3444.52
have Fineman hated philosophy but he

3442.63 --> 3447.1
would philosophize from

3444.52 --> 3450.67
mathematical perspective it's like

3447.1 --> 3453.13
structural philosophy but yeah you can

3450.67 --> 3457.2400000000002
call that not philosophy but it kind of

3453.13 --> 3459.78
is because it is speculative based on

3457.24 --> 3463.7099999999996
connections that he's seen mathematical

3459.78 --> 3466.4500000000003
extrapolations all that it is

3463.71 --> 3469.78
philosophizing what he did a lot he also

3466.45 --> 3472.18
pointed at direct relations and then

3469.78 --> 3479.8
said if there is a causal or just the

3472.18 --> 3483.0699999999997
correlation but he did philosophize but

3479.8 --> 3485.8300000000004
just not in just not in the like sense

3483.07 --> 3489.01
of reality world type of philosophy is

3485.83 --> 3493.0
just more structure philosophy that is

3489.01 --> 3496.57
speculation it seriously goes it's

3493.0 --> 3497.89
basically pseudoscience speculation but

3496.57 --> 3500.98
he was clear about that

3497.89 --> 3503.47
he wouldn't assume something to be true

3500.98 --> 3504.72
if he didn't know that it was absolutely

3503.47 --> 3507.22
true

3504.72 --> 3510.0099999999998
although he may have probably made a few

3507.22 --> 3511.48
mistakes that like predictions that he

3510.01 --> 3514.7200000000003
was certain of that didn't turn out to

3511.48 --> 3517.57
be right maybe maybe that's gonna be

3514.72 --> 3520.9599999999996
flip flip flopping around as the as time

3517.57 --> 3524.32
passes and new angles to how things work

3520.96 --> 3526.69
pop up with new yeah the new angles will

3524.32 --> 3530.2200000000003
certainly make things he said correct or

3526.69 --> 3530.2200000000003
incorrect so it goes all over the place

3533.42 --> 3536.599
[Music]

3537.91 --> 3543.19
are you serious super curved he

3540.289 --> 3545.2990000000004
constantly does that maybe

3543.19 --> 3548.829
philosophizing is not the right word

3545.299 --> 3551.599
it's just I I feel like it is like

3548.829 --> 3553.73
philosophizing it's not technical

3551.599 --> 3554.3900000000003
philosophizing I just tried to describe

3553.73 --> 3558.71
it okay

3554.39 --> 3561.3489999999997
super curved right so not philosophizing

3558.71 --> 3565.299
in the literal sense of that word but

3561.349 --> 3568.51
the way I described it right technical

3565.299 --> 3573.2599999999998
mathematics based mechanical

3568.51 --> 3581.1800000000003
extrapolations and connection based

3573.26 --> 3583.849
assumptions things that he would see the

3581.18 --> 3588.19
whole thing is full of it from what I've

3583.849 --> 3588.19
read so far it's just a lot of it

3592.3 --> 3597.559
alright anyway this just predicted this

3595.4 --> 3599.869
is this good nonsense going on for

3597.559 --> 3606.8900000000003
another half hour basically people

3599.869 --> 3613.339
saying this [ __ ] yeah darkstar I I

3606.89 --> 3614.99
haven't read is it his essay but I have

3613.339 --> 3619.339
it it's 33 pages

3614.99 --> 3621.9799999999996
I didn't didn't really get to reading it

3619.339 --> 3624.41
don't know if I will but I think it is

3621.98 --> 3627.8
cool that he did that I know very

3624.41 --> 3631.94
curious to see what is yeah what's gonna

3627.8 --> 3632.48
happen with that so oh you're calling me

3631.94 --> 3636.52
out are you

3632.48 --> 3640.73
oh I'm timing you out just so you know

3636.52 --> 3643.52
because I am NOT gonna be doing things

3640.73 --> 3646.67
because you say I need to do that I'm

3643.52 --> 3650.0
not gonna read anything that I don't

3646.67 --> 3652.28
want I'm not gonna do anything

3650.0 --> 3657.53
I don't want and I'm not gonna buy

3652.28 --> 3661.4300000000003
anything I don't want and nobody in my

3657.53 --> 3664.329
chat or even that I know can make me do

3661.43 --> 3669.2
that without me it's very specifically

3664.329 --> 3673.04
wanting that okay so don't get any ideas

3669.2 --> 3677.39
you cannot make me do anything in any

3673.04 --> 3685.52
way be it peer pressure threat whatever

3677.39 --> 3687.2
it's very simple so anyway thanks

3685.52 --> 3689.96
everyone for coming I'm gonna round out

3687.2 --> 3691.609

and the super chats that would be much

3705.799 --> 3712.609
appreciated and thank you those that

3708.26 --> 3714.559
have donated thank you very much so I

3712.609 --> 3719.5099999999998
will be back tomorrow with letters

3714.559 --> 3721.01
early-bird number 313 and I'm gonna join

3719.51 --> 3723.619
the Flat Earth debates right after this

3721.01 --> 3725.09
though I might just go out as soon as I

3723.619 --> 3727.01
get my money and just the

3725.09 --> 3729.86
get huge amount of groceries that I

3727.01 --> 3732.5600000000004
really need and get a proper lunch but

3729.86 --> 3736.1600000000003
I'm going to join it anyway and yeah

3732.56 --> 3740.92
hashtag me if I indeed uber Mukul till
