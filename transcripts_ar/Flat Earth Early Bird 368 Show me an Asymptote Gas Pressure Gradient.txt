[Music]

402.7 --> 415.81
Manso bandit Robin Stanley Hey

410.95 --> 419.95
all right welcome welcome newcomers Pete

415.81 --> 425.32
Harrington yeah it's sometimes tough for

419.95 --> 428.17
me I forget I forget there's new people

425.32 --> 430.27
just popping in or other people that

428.17 --> 430.84000000000003
have watch that are deciding to just say

430.27 --> 434.91999999999996
hello

430.84 --> 438.72999999999996
and I'm just in my mind I'm kind of used

434.92 --> 440.41
to talking to like everyone that's been

438.73 --> 442.45000000000005
there from the start I'm kind of

440.41 --> 445.18
constantly assuming that everybody knows

442.45 --> 453.37
everything that's transpired with me but

445.18 --> 454.96
that's often not the case so yeah it's

453.37 --> 458.89
kind of weird because sometimes just

454.96 --> 461.62
sometimes if I don't identify new people

458.89 --> 463.9
properly then I'll think it's a troll

461.62 --> 469.12
because they ask questions that are just

463.9 --> 470.97999999999996
fresh but I it would I could interpret

469.12 --> 475.29
that as being out of place like you're

470.98 --> 480.81
trying to joke me on purpose in certain

475.29 --> 480.81
states of mind not the case today time

481.98 --> 491.83000000000004
anyway yeah welcome newcomers and of

485.68 --> 496.03000000000003
course regular followers so yeah I'm I'm

491.83 --> 503.74
pretty open for any discussion it seems

496.03 --> 505.53999999999996
like you're all very talky I'm also open

503.74 --> 511.78000000000003
for a panel of course it's a Saturday

505.54 --> 516.1800000000001
show so yeah it could go on for a long

511.78 --> 516.18
time if it's if it's interesting

521.68 --> 531.6099999999999
well George Sanford so so does

524.559 --> 536.439
Christianity so do a lot of things it's

531.61 --> 539.17
rather that the difference with Islam I

536.439 --> 541.899
guess and this is a rough estimation is

539.17 --> 544.0889999999999
that they don't just say it's bad don't

541.899 --> 546.009
do it no they kind of forbid it that's

544.089 --> 548.74
the difference Islam for just forbids

546.009 --> 558.91
it's very black and white about a lot of

548.74 --> 564.5790000000001
things that's the difference but I don't

558.91 --> 568.319
think there's any or any main line overt

564.579 --> 574.54
and not covert religion that is just

568.319 --> 577.929
okay with usury well yeah there may be

574.54 --> 580.7199999999999
certain types of religions if you even

577.929 --> 583.869
can call those religions but yeah all

580.72 --> 587.86
the big ones all the ones that can

583.869 --> 591.0690000000001
identify logos maybe from different

587.86 --> 593.0790000000001
angles none of them they're going to say

591.069 --> 596.29
like oh yeah yeah you definitely do that

593.079 --> 599.17
oh yeah

596.29 --> 600.819
unless it would be I don't know no I

599.17 --> 606.939
don't think there's any out there really

600.819 --> 610.99
to do that or or they would see it as

606.939 --> 614.05
like a war method approach and that is

610.99 --> 618.279
kind of it technically but yeah why

614.05 --> 622.649
would anyone do that so badly what

618.279 --> 622.649
grants that nothing really

631.42 --> 634.51
[Music]

901.04 --> 907.019
it's nice to sit back and listen right

903.68 --> 911.189
yeah it does so yeah one of the things I

907.019 --> 915.66
noticed it definitely yeah got the

911.189 --> 917.9699999999999
conversation rolling because yeah that's

915.66 --> 920.459
sometimes to be fair you know like I

917.97 --> 923.129
really appreciate you especially but

920.459 --> 926.9989999999999
sometimes things get a little quiet like

923.129 --> 929.16
everybody's like almost like tired from

926.999 --> 931.649
work or something and then it often

929.16 --> 933.66
after a while it just goes back up you

931.649 --> 935.61
know whose look who's talking I have

933.66 --> 939.12
exactly the same thing here on my show

935.61 --> 941.309
sometimes right just like yeah exactly

939.12 --> 944.509
and then suddenly you wake up and it's

941.309 --> 946.5889999999999
like oh wait stuff to talk about

944.509 --> 949.0500000000001
literally that's why we've moved it to

946.589 --> 950.999
Mary 11 because Josh's job he literally

949.05 --> 952.41
gets in from work than the show starts

950.999 --> 954.72
so that's why we're waiting sometimes

952.41 --> 956.61
just for him to get in from work so

954.72 --> 958.0500000000001
Walt's only just got off because either

956.61 --> 961.1
they're up at 4:00 in the morning doing

961.1 --> 968.5790000000001
analysis oh thanks

963.87 --> 972.809

968.579 --> 978.7199999999999

972.809 --> 981.179
America right right exactly so you're

978.72 --> 985.379
gonna have somebody that's in the awake

981.179 --> 991.29
time zone basically very much that's

985.379 --> 993.689

1154.7 --> 1161.0
it's only fair to return the favor

1157.19 --> 1171.2
I know about the Jews oh god that sounds

1161.0 --> 1173.27
really weird did you well yeah well I

1171.2 --> 1176.02
certainly have figured out in the course

1173.27 --> 1181.58
of my life that it's just so such a

1176.02 --> 1188.6299999999999
complicated issue all of it it's I

1181.58 --> 1191.09
wasn't flippant but no but on every

1188.63 --> 1193.1000000000001
level it's like there's controversy on

1191.09 --> 1201.23
every level that's the issue and it just

1193.1 --> 1204.1699999999998
feels like it's all like Mendte yeah I

1201.23 --> 1206.83
don't know to confuse us to make us look

1204.17 --> 1210.74
less clear at it somehow

1206.83 --> 1212.75
just every level yeah just everywhere

1210.74 --> 1215.24
you look you know whether it and I'm not

1212.75 --> 1217.16
this is not even meant negatively but

1215.24 --> 1220.46
whether it's concerning like Israel the

1217.16 --> 1225.0800000000002
state and what it does or considering

1220.46 --> 1227.51
well Jews and like what is it

1225.08 --> 1230.1799999999998
and what is said about it what do they

1227.51 --> 1232.96
think about it and then you notice that

1230.18 --> 1235.79
there's just so many factors there's the

1232.96 --> 1239.3
origin of all the supposed tribes and

1235.79 --> 1241.6
then there is the idea of the genetics

1239.3 --> 1241.6
and

1243.38 --> 1248.49
to me like every time I look at it it's

1246.57 --> 1250.26
almost like okay you have kind of the

1248.49 --> 1252.48
regular world and it's pretty damn

1250.26 --> 1257.04
complicated and then you have the Jews

1252.48 --> 1261.29
it's like almost just as complicated as

1257.04 --> 1266.28
everything else is it's so eat fast and

1261.29 --> 1269.22
yeah so to me I'm just like okay I'll

1266.28 --> 1273.12
just try to be as fair and careful as

1269.22 --> 1274.8
possible every time because it goes in

1273.12 --> 1282.6299999999999
all directions every time it's brought

1274.8 --> 1286.68
up everybody starts to spiral what do

1282.63 --> 1289.2600000000002
you think okay I think it's a game I

1286.68 --> 1292.23
think that all of these titles

1289.26 --> 1296.76
definitions of what has been placed here

1292.23 --> 1301.08
to control it and they've got such a

1296.76 --> 1303.3
beautiful story that they can press

1301.08 --> 1306.6899999999998
buttons here and there and stir up

1303.3 --> 1309.6299999999999
racial hatred religious hatred political

1306.69 --> 1312.06
hatreds they're all fantastic buttons

1309.63 --> 1317.5500000000002
that they they're pressed to distract us

1312.06 --> 1318.84
from the bubble whirring rate keeps you

1317.55 --> 1327.6599999999999
seeing the truth doesn't it

1318.84 --> 1329.87
I found the NASA SWAT team oh dear I'm

1327.66 --> 1333.74
just gonna put in the chat for you

1329.87 --> 1333.7399999999998
there's a link there

1334.96 --> 1345.49
so they're parallel they compete in

1336.82 --> 1349.02
competitions with other SWAT teams okay

1345.49 --> 1349.02
let me check that out

1360.51 --> 1370.6589999999999
say this great historical purposes Wow

1365.32 --> 1373.09
look at that disclaimer like NASA put on

1370.659 --> 1378.0590000000002
top a disclaimer this material is being

1373.09 --> 1378.059
kept online for historical purposes oh

1381.09 --> 1387.6
yeah but it's no longer being updated

1384.6 --> 1387.6
right

1398.45 --> 1417.69
712 vices 2005 this little piece is from

1405.42 --> 1419.91
2005 that's 14 years ago hmm Oh what are

1417.69 --> 1422.01
you looking at by the way this is this

1419.91 --> 1423.8400000000001
is a video of I'm not listed - I just

1422.01 --> 1427.17
put it on the screen rock so this is the

1423.84 --> 1429.86
NASA SWAT team doing their trainer god

1427.17 --> 1429.8600000000001
knows what they're for

1434.49 --> 1441.929
it could it okay now I'm looking at ad

1437.399 --> 1445.799
from a less paranoid angle maybe it has

1441.929 --> 1449.249
to do with the idea of space force like

1445.799 --> 1461.22
this is the your the moving into that

1449.249 --> 1463.98
concept Stargate subtle fantastical idea

1461.22 --> 1466.2
by the way it is very tricky and

1463.98 --> 1468.1490000000001
inspiring they're really like oh you

1466.2 --> 1469.95
want to be a science fiction soldier

1468.149 --> 1470.4599999999998
just like any computer games in the

1469.95 --> 1473.6100000000001
movies

1470.46 --> 1477.1490000000001
Oh God trying to take on the race and

1473.61 --> 1482.4599999999998
they obviously know what isn't the right

1477.149 --> 1487.2489999999998
one of the was he hath or and there is

1482.46 --> 1494.429
Egyptian gods in and they had right

1487.249 --> 1501.72
maybe I I don't know what they're what

1494.429 --> 1505.919
they're fabricating but yeah it's NASA

1501.72 --> 1508.23
again you know they are they make the

1505.919 --> 1513.259
stories and they try to write it so it

1508.23 --> 1515.789
all fits in their original idea paradigm

1513.259 --> 1518.759
but yeah that's what they do they make

1515.789 --> 1520.95
stories and yet they they may trick you

1518.759 --> 1523.679
they may fascinate you but often it's

1520.95 --> 1526.23
very tough to figure out like maybe

1523.679 --> 1529.409
there is something true about it or they

1526.23 --> 1533.999
spin something slightly because and that

1529.409 --> 1539.94
keeps people hooked too yeah there are a

1533.999 --> 1542.249
bunch of wizards but yeah weird I

1539.94 --> 1546.8990000000001
thought it was really creepy idea but

1542.249 --> 1551.039
maybe that's because yeah it plays into

1546.899 --> 1551.5189999999998
maybe a bit of a paranoia fracture yeah

1551.039 --> 1556.08
I've got it

1551.519 --> 1558.8990000000001
Alan why does NASA need a SWAT team to

1556.08 --> 1561.649
steal moon dust from retirees on screen

1558.899 --> 1561.649
share it with you

1562.41 --> 1579.49
you got it huh

1566.559 --> 1589.78
although police-state usa.com 2013 that

1579.49 --> 1593.53
is odd well what do they there we go

1589.78 --> 1595.9289999999999
in May 2011 a 74 year old grandmother

1593.53 --> 1598.809
from California was the subject of one

1595.929 --> 1600.49
swat sting operation performed to seize

1598.809 --> 1603.8799999999999
a piece of her personal property without

1600.49 --> 1605.559
compensation Jo Ann Davis needing to

1603.88 --> 1607.1200000000001
raise money to care for her six on

1605.559 --> 1609.19
decided to sell a gift that she was

1607.12 --> 1613.9599999999998
given to her that was given to her

1609.19 --> 1617.2
husband 42 years earlier by astronaut

1613.96 --> 1619.299
Neil Armstrong Davis's husband who

1617.2 --> 1621.52
passed away in 86 was a space engineer

1619.299 --> 1623.83
and NASA contractor and friend of

1621.52 --> 1625.9
Armstrong's Davis received from him a

1623.83 --> 1630.22
speck of dust from the moon embedded

1625.9 --> 1631.539
into a decorative paperweight the moon

1630.22 --> 1633.19
stores paperwork was quite rare and

1631.539 --> 1635.14
valuable and Davis attempted the self

1633.19 --> 1637.78
reforms to treat her son's illness to

1635.14 --> 1639.25
contribute to a child's inheritance when

1637.78 --> 1641.1399999999999
she reached out for potential buyers and

1639.25 --> 1643.62
after months of 13 she unwittingly

1641.14 --> 1646.3300000000002
linked up with a secret federal agent

1643.62 --> 1648.85
Davis an undercover agent agreed to meet

1646.33 --> 1652.99
at Danny's Retta Denny's restaurant in

1648.85 --> 1655.36
Lake Elsinore California as Davis sat

1652.99 --> 1658.419
across from the would-be but would-be

1655.36 --> 1661.24
buyer an armed team of NASA cops waited

1658.419 --> 1663.25
outside when she placed the paperweight

1661.24 --> 1667.059
on the table the strike team made their

1663.25 --> 1669.01
entrance Davis recalled to CBS someone

1667.059 --> 1670.33
is grabbing me from the back now they're

1669.01 --> 1673.0
pulling me out the booth and they have

1670.33 --> 1674.8899999999999
hold of me pretty darn good and force

1673.0 --> 1679.27
was like unnecessary because I'm like

1674.89 --> 1680.6200000000001
110 pounds I'm 4 foot 11 they dragged me

1679.27 --> 1684.73
out of Denny she said I was scared

1680.62 --> 1688.59
really scared I won't go into too much

1684.73 --> 1691.0
more detail but you know Peter Davis

1688.59 --> 1693.34
Peter Schuler Davis attorney told CBS

1691.0 --> 1694.63
News there's no such law that moon rocks

1693.34 --> 1696.82
belong to the federal court

1694.63 --> 1698.3500000000001
and there are laws about stealing from

1696.82 --> 1699.9099999999999
the federal government I understand that

1698.35 --> 1701.62
and if anybody could show that these

1699.91 --> 1703.72
moon rocks were stolen from the federal

1701.62 --> 1705.9699999999998
government that's of course a different

1703.72 --> 1708.07
that's a horse of a different color but

1705.97 --> 1710.26
they haven't shown that Davis was not

1708.07 --> 1711.6699999999998
charged with the crime the NASA cops

1710.26 --> 1716.62
simply roughed her up and stole her

1711.67 --> 1721.24
property there you go all right well

1716.62 --> 1723.28
okay curiosity satisfied or without

1721.24 --> 1725.32
right well it seems pretty

1723.28 --> 1728.32
straightforward situation it was

1725.32 --> 1733.75
probably information control because

1728.32 --> 1736.12
they had a story about moon dust it

1733.75 --> 1738.55
she was designated with it and then kind

1736.12 --> 1741.4299999999998
of like did the wrong thing with it

1738.55 --> 1743.3799999999999
could compromise the story safety or

1741.43 --> 1747.0700000000002
whatever so they kind of like didn't

1743.38 --> 1751.0
know what else to do so they just kind

1747.07 --> 1752.82
of used a typical government approach as

1751.0 --> 1756.61
in that we're just gonna collect it and

1752.82 --> 1759.1599999999999
yeah everybody will be mad but at least

1756.61 --> 1762.76
the story is now contained before people

1759.16 --> 1768.22
in general to get the hint of why they

1762.76 --> 1770.08
even did that see it's made it so that

1768.22 --> 1771.94
somebody can't get it and analyze it

1770.08 --> 1775.51
because Ashley has it looking like

1771.94 --> 1779.7
another their adults would more

1775.51 --> 1782.7
petrified wood yeah could be yeah I

1779.7 --> 1782.7
agree

1782.79 --> 1794.34
that's what I think as well so yeah I'd

1787.12 --> 1799.7199999999998
add that is kind of beautiful relief

1794.34 --> 1803.02
yeah to me it's still it's still crazy

1799.72 --> 1805.27
story of course but I I thought like

1803.02 --> 1809.08
what SWAT teams like are they doing this

1805.27 --> 1813.04
now but apparently this is 2005 and all

1809.08 --> 1815.35
that so no I but but look this reports

1813.04 --> 1819.85
also that they compete all the time so

1815.35 --> 1825.62
their current 2019 compete 2018 they're

1819.85 --> 1831.08
competing in the security team

1825.62 --> 1836.2099999999998
Awards was exciting ffs in 2090 nothing

1831.08 --> 1843.4099999999999
RIT ok so there yeah basically a private

1836.21 --> 1846.65
SWAT team kind of do they take security

1843.41 --> 1847.8400000000001
jobs or do they only secure NASA related

1846.65 --> 1854.42
things

1847.84 --> 1860.3
is there any clarity about that what is

1854.42 --> 1864.68
their task usually SWAT teams get like

1860.3 --> 1866.56
very specific task designations and all

1864.68 --> 1873.3500000000001
that like what is the team about what

1866.56 --> 1876.8899999999999
all that sorry I'm asking too many

1873.35 --> 1879.26
questions you're assuming I know now

1876.89 --> 1886.13
exactly and you probably don't so but

1879.26 --> 1888.44
still her in patrols it's just basic

1886.13 --> 1891.3500000000001
on-site of the Kennedy Space Station

1888.44 --> 1893.5700000000002
therefore I suppose case alodia loaded G

1891.35 --> 1897.37
Hadees came running in there to protect

1893.57 --> 1897.37
him for that I honor but hmm

1898.99 --> 1903.52
okay right

1906.16 --> 1909.16
mm-hmm

1910.26 --> 1914.89
wait what

1912.49 --> 1918.64
what's that a hypothetical case or did

1914.89 --> 1925.0800000000002
that really happen at some point what

1918.64 --> 1925.0800000000002
when well the drug you know what was

1925.38 --> 1944.409
2011 May 2011 okay I was completely

1940.36 --> 1947.2199999999998
unaware of that then again yeah I really

1944.409 --> 1949.99
only awaked will walk to flat earth and

1947.22 --> 1952.74
making me pay more attention to things

1949.99 --> 1955.539
in 2015 so I'm not surprised that

1952.74 --> 1958.51
something for years before that eluded

1955.539 --> 1962.1
me it's I don't know but I've never

1958.51 --> 1964.769
heard it before nobody brought it up

1962.1 --> 1967.24
when I was listening I guess

1964.769 --> 1968.83
so what are they useful that's a lot

1967.24 --> 1970.6
it's not entirely clear why it isn't

1968.83 --> 1972.49
necessary to patrol the property with

1970.6 --> 1975.25
the Sharpshooter dangling a sniper rifle

1972.49 --> 1977.6490000000001
outside of a helicopter but NASA isn't

1975.25 --> 1979.87
going to give al-qaeda any chances even

1977.649 --> 1981.399
they're taking the piss besides the

1979.87 --> 1983.5
excitement of pretending the property's

1981.399 --> 1985.649
surrounded by hostile military forces

1983.5 --> 1988.269
NASA's police are used for crowd control

1985.649 --> 1992.35
and the astronauts come out for photo

1988.269 --> 1996.01
ops men with rifles separate them from

1992.35 --> 1997.809
their fans these exaggerated security

1996.01 --> 1999.85
measures may or may not impress you but

1997.809 --> 2002.07
what about when NASA cops leave the

1999.85 --> 2003.4189999999999
space station to perform undercover

2002.07 --> 2005.34
sting ups and then it goes into the old

2003.419 --> 2008.179
lady again so I think they're

2005.34 --> 2010.9089999999999
questioning why they'd pretend in their

2008.179 --> 2016.8600000000001
ice a space force what are they doing

2010.909 --> 2021.019
hmm okay so yeah the way they're

2016.86 --> 2024.1789999999999
presented is really to secure NASA

2021.019 --> 2025.86
assets and all that because they are

2024.179 --> 2028.3090000000002
apparently scared that at some point

2025.86 --> 2031.4699999999998
they're going to be targeted by more

2028.309 --> 2033.6
terrorist actions or something

2031.47 --> 2037.799
that's something I didn't see coming

2033.6 --> 2039.6589999999999
really well on the other hand I probably

2037.799 --> 2042.99
should have with the way the world works

2039.659 --> 2045.5
I think as it says in the Australia it's

2042.99 --> 2053.94
just [ __ ] to justify the budget

2045.5 --> 2057.899
maybe that too but yeah bizarre like why

2053.94 --> 2059.79
would you even want to do that like

2057.899 --> 2065.0989999999997
attack them over Italy like that's

2059.79 --> 2068.73
ridiculous just just have a conversation

2065.099 --> 2072.569
with him just ask him how do you have

2068.73 --> 2075.72
gas pressure on the earth next to the

2072.569 --> 2079.409
outer space without a membrane in

2075.72 --> 2085.4399999999996
between how does that work with entropy

2079.409 --> 2090.179
and then yeah that kind of diffuses

2085.44 --> 2092.399
their power much more than like we are

2090.179 --> 2094.379
blowing them up you know that'll that's

2092.399 --> 2098.15
just gonna martyr them or maybe that is

2094.379 --> 2101.2799999999997
the idea or the perceived idea that

2098.15 --> 2105.829
maybe that is an expectation they kind

2101.28 --> 2108.6600000000003
of now want from their followers as well

2105.829 --> 2111.3900000000003
to be martyrs about it like oh my

2108.66 --> 2113.3689999999997
religion they can't find a way out of

2111.39 --> 2115.29
course because they have no argument so

2113.369 --> 2120.1800000000003
then they're gonna like oh they're going

2115.29 --> 2122.609
to attack us now oh I don't know maybe

2120.18 --> 2127.29
that could happen don't like the idea of

2122.609 --> 2130.7
it just standard ways to keep it up the

2127.29 --> 2130.7
levels of fear porn isn't it

2131.22 --> 2141.569
I hate Fairport right I'm gonna do what

2139.8 --> 2143.4900000000002
I'm gonna get some lunch my friend and

2141.569 --> 2145.619
listen to the are you on for another

2143.49 --> 2148.68
arrow so yeah it could be

2145.619 --> 2153.4500000000003
hmm I might pop baka throw at me cool

2148.68 --> 2155.46
alright so yeah have a good lunch no

2153.45 --> 2157.56
worries my I'll cash in a bit alright

2155.46 --> 2159.95
thanks for the couple night so you might

2157.56 --> 2159.95
buy back

2161.39 --> 2174.75
mmm yeah that was interesting didn't

2169.349 --> 2176.849
expect to get into all that but yeah

2174.75 --> 2180.45
that that's kind of interesting though

2176.849 --> 2183.349
that yeah this seems like a much more

2180.45 --> 2185.91
sensible approach as to why and what

2183.349 --> 2189.329
concerning the stories also were very

2185.91 --> 2192.95
telling that there they may be doing

2189.329 --> 2197.2200000000003
this kind of like a victim protection

2192.95 --> 2199.859
thing and you have more budget for them

2197.22 --> 2207.48
to spend and potential side options

2199.859 --> 2212.609
maybe who knows yeah it's ridiculous

2207.48 --> 2219.45
like why would you ever like physically

2212.609 --> 2221.31
attack something NASA yours it's like to

2219.45 --> 2223.49
me that that feels just like you would

2221.31 --> 2227.24
attack a circus or something like a why

2223.49 --> 2227.24
it's just insane

2228.8 --> 2236.44
it's just gonna hurt a lot of feelings

2230.96 --> 2236.44
and yeah make things more complicated

2250.52 --> 2259.66
did you discover what goes I mean no

2255.98 --> 2266.09
search echo although considering that I

2259.66 --> 2268.3399999999997
how I perceive like spirits of living

2266.09 --> 2272.27
people and how you can sense that and

2268.34 --> 2277.19
how it compares to the typical

2272.27 --> 2282.53
perceptions of ghosts I'd say they have

2277.19 --> 2284.93
kind of like an air energy but I don't

2282.53 --> 2288.4700000000003
know I think it's probably measureable

2284.93 --> 2292.7599999999998
energy there's hints to that there are

2288.47 --> 2295.43
yeah there's widespread lore about what

2292.76 --> 2297.8300000000004
can typically happen for example extreme

2295.43 --> 2302.39
temperature changes are also

2297.83 --> 2305.0
electromagnetic activity and yeah

2302.39 --> 2308.15
sightings like it yeah this sounds very

2305.0 --> 2313.25
UFO II now but it's what it is

2308.15 --> 2317.27
and I've yeah I've witnessed things like

2313.25 --> 2319.55
that and very awake it's not overlaid

2317.27 --> 2322.75
hallucination or anything or no not a

2319.55 --> 2326.3900000000003
dark world experience it's very awake

2322.75 --> 2331.58
and have been very interested in all

2326.39 --> 2334.19
that but yeah what are they made up well

2331.58 --> 2336.98
they're not if a physical substance like

2334.19 --> 2339.32
for example Ghostbusters would suggest

2336.98 --> 2341.48
and it's not just Ghostbusters my way

2339.32 --> 2344.6600000000003
like that there would be active plasmic

2341.48 --> 2347.72
residue there's there's even pretty old

2344.66 --> 2351.6189999999997
older movies they were very much into

2347.72 --> 2355.0099999999998
that and it's just yeah back in the

2351.619 --> 2356.6000000000004
nineteen or in the 28th 20th century

2355.01 --> 2360.17
there was a lot of thinking about that

2356.6 --> 2363.13
like what is that and there were

2360.17 --> 2367.42
probably a lot of research concerning

2363.13 --> 2370.19
spectral phenomena as it were and

2367.42 --> 2373.79
apparently that ectoplasmic residue

2370.19 --> 2376.4
thing Springs from that it's very

2373.79 --> 2380.17
fascinating but I can yeah even they

2376.4 --> 2383.69
call it residue as in a side product not

2380.17 --> 2385.82
literal what it is

2383.69 --> 2389.77
the substance of the manifestation

2385.82 --> 2398.63
itself so it's not made of anything yeah

2389.77 --> 2402.17
it's just energy I think yeah and sorry

2398.63 --> 2409.31
AGM if I ignored you or whatever I was

2402.17 --> 2411.35
very preoccupied with Adam II can didn't

2409.31 --> 2414.73
really look through chat what people are

2411.35 --> 2414.73
saying sorry about that

2420.28 --> 2423.489
[Music]

2433.27 --> 2438.61
stop capturing hm it's very annoying

2469.71 --> 2479.2200000000003
you have me to Fyodor Dostoevsky okay

2477.059 --> 2481.71
Laurie a gem maybe you should drop it

2479.22 --> 2487.7
now because you're spamming my chat fool

2481.71 --> 2490.7
with your yeah it's bickering stop it

2487.7 --> 2490.7
please

2521.68 --> 2530.3489999999997
good so yeah any any follow-up to that I

2526.029 --> 2533.289
had question about ghosts yeah I can

2530.349 --> 2536.799
answer that I did orab splob a lot

2533.289 --> 2541.26
there's so much about that but anything

2536.799 --> 2544.5389999999998
else come on guys I'm here Inquirer

2541.26 --> 2548.0690000000004
information I have a lots don't just

2544.539 --> 2548.0690000000004
bicker amongst yourselves please

2551.95 --> 2555.6099999999997
[Music]

2560.35 --> 2563.63
[Music]

2570.61 --> 2577.06
oh really the studio that's a very

2574.48 --> 2585.51
complicated issue you're addressing

2577.06 --> 2589.21
there because what is it a ghost yeah I

2585.51 --> 2598.42
don't think ghosts are spirits

2589.21 --> 2603.16
I think ghosts are energy absorbed by

2598.42 --> 2606.2200000000003
material that is like a natural part of

2603.16 --> 2609.97
certain type of people they do that to

2606.22 --> 2611.7999999999997
interact with it better it be their

2609.97 --> 2613.4199999999996
region becomes theirs it's like

2611.8 --> 2615.79
especially with where they live that's

2613.42 --> 2619.33
why it's known that ghosts typically go

2615.79 --> 2623.17
in living houses where people are right

2619.33 --> 2627.46
very important hints so what ghosts are

2623.17 --> 2629.5
is basically psionic residue that is

2627.46 --> 2632.08
absorbed by material especially wood

2629.5 --> 2636.49
it's known to be absorbed by woods and

2632.08 --> 2640.63
if you have sensitivity then becoming in

2636.49 --> 2644.7999999999997
touch with that frequency will subject

2640.63 --> 2648.85
you to getting shadows like reflections

2644.8 --> 2651.3100000000004
of the energy of the individual and the

2648.85 --> 2654.63
story tied into them and their personal

2651.31 --> 2659.2
conflict it happens I've experienced it

2654.63 --> 2663.34
and others as well other people just

2659.2 --> 2666.43
yeah but that's not a spirit its psionic

2663.34 --> 2670.77
residue can hang around much very long

2666.43 --> 2675.52
after and it can be wiped away as well

2670.77 --> 2680.04
with high electromagnetic pulses it's

2675.52 --> 2683.04
like an EMP actually yeah erases ghosts

2680.04 --> 2683.04
apparitions

2683.29 --> 2689.11
yeah it's real okay but that's ghosts

2687.22 --> 2692.4399999999996
that's the idea of a ghost it's very

2689.11 --> 2695.29
location bound so it's always location

2692.44 --> 2696.88
bound very specific hint okay that's not

2695.29 --> 2699.13
a spirit but that doesn't mean that

2696.88 --> 2701.28
there are no spirits it's just something

2699.13 --> 2701.28
else

2701.88 --> 2708.6400000000003
for example orbs that's something else

2706.299 --> 2713.89
that's something that actually I

2708.64 --> 2717.009
consider orbs to be spiritual life forms

2713.89 --> 2720.749
or primitive life forms that literally

2717.009 --> 2725.739
bask or feed off the energy that can be

2720.749 --> 2730.089
present in a region and yeah they are

2725.739 --> 2733.449
visible to some degree but that's

2730.089 --> 2737.739
another thing that's not a intelligent

2733.449 --> 2740.9790000000003
entity even too much it's it's like an

2737.739 --> 2743.4990000000003
amoeba life-form but it's not physical

2740.979 --> 2745.4199999999996
its energy based it's very science

2743.499 --> 2749.4399999999996
fictiony in a way but I really think

2745.42 --> 2752.969
that is what it is so yeah freakin

2749.44 --> 2757.119
mysterious world it's not all the same

2752.969 --> 2764.469
it isn't I did serious research on this

2757.119 --> 2766.9
myself oh thank you by the way mind of

2764.469 --> 2770.079
God for the one dollar ninety-nine super

2766.9 --> 2779.039
Chad the nation again earth is flat

2770.079 --> 2786.4
piece or winner indeed thank you is this

2779.039 --> 2788.619
did you get more Google bonus yeah I

2786.4 --> 2794.5190000000002
think you did thanks anyway

2788.619 --> 2794.5190000000002
thanks for for dropping that with me

2804.68 --> 2806.71
ah

2807.2 --> 2810.2799999999997
[Music]

2815.31 --> 2823.0099999999998
I still check I know orbs are absolutely

2818.19 --> 2823.01
not that no they are not

2824.51 --> 2828.0800000000004
it does look different

2835.65 --> 2840.1600000000003
have you tried because hey if you're

2838.96 --> 2844.09
claiming in his dust

2840.16 --> 2846.37
you can falsify that okay get a camera

2844.09 --> 2850.1400000000003
get kind of typical similar scenario

2846.37 --> 2853.99
with from spotlight and all that and

2850.14 --> 2858.85
drop some dust look what that looks like

2853.99 --> 2863.9799999999996
not like harps absolutely not no it's

2858.85 --> 2867.43
not dust and by the way it's not just

2863.98 --> 2875.1
herbs it's there are other weird things

2867.43 --> 2877.81
never seen a tube I think that's also

2875.1 --> 2883.0
kind of like a spiritual phenomena

2877.81 --> 2886.89
life-form thingy something but that's

2883.0 --> 2889.33
also like one of those things out there

2886.89 --> 2891.8199999999997
the Rob's I think they call them rods

2889.33 --> 2897.31
and there are sometimes claim to be huge

2891.82 --> 2902.5
I don't know like I've seen them very

2897.31 --> 2903.85
small as well so yeah whatever it's

2902.5 --> 2906.25
gonna be assume about them that their

2903.85 --> 2908.62
spaceships or intergalactic crap really

2906.25 --> 2910.72
are they are or are they just very large

2908.62 --> 2915.46
firsts and versions of some kind of

2910.72 --> 2918.8199999999997
spiritual worm that just goes because

2915.46 --> 2924.06
every time I see them it yeah to me it

2918.82 --> 2928.36
almost looks like like a fish that just

2924.06 --> 2930.88
bites or eats something that maybe we

2928.36 --> 2935.88
don't even perceive that is there in

2930.88 --> 2935.88
that special location I don't know

2941.04 --> 2945.949
[Music]

2948.29 --> 2953.21
okay Laurie that's that's no don't go

2952.77 --> 2956.21
there

2953.21 --> 2956.21
don't

2962.06 --> 2965.239
[Music]

2966.43 --> 2971.44
they feed on negative energy what are

2969.43 --> 2973.8599999999997
you talking about negative energy how do

2971.44 --> 2973.86
you know

2979.97 --> 2987.83
and exactly what what are we talking I'm

2983.52 --> 2987.83
talking about the variety of subjects

2997.28 --> 3001.219
[Music]

3003.099 --> 3012.7290000000003
hmm right ESP power yeah I've heard that

3008.789 --> 3016.9
it can happen but also the symptoms are

3012.729 --> 3019.989
extremely telling and kind of always the

3016.9 --> 3021.789
same so if somebody has that that it's

3019.989 --> 3024.64
not a bacteria by the way it's a

3021.789 --> 3028.9
parasite okay it's larger than one

3024.64 --> 3033.3089999999997
celled it's a parasite and you can get

3028.9 --> 3036.7290000000003
rid of it quite easily however if you

3033.309 --> 3038.529
have a huge amount of cats that

3036.729 --> 3041.319
especially if you don't have any

3038.529 --> 3043.569
oversight anymore yeah then it's just

3041.319 --> 3045.779
almost impossible if they get infected

3043.569 --> 3048.999
with that parasite to get rid of them

3045.779 --> 3052.299
with it all it just keeps on that's the

3048.999 --> 3056.589
problem but if you just have a cat and

3052.299 --> 3059.319
it happens to catch it you can yeah get

3056.589 --> 3063.009
it away with the parasite and so with

3059.319 --> 3067.839
yourself as well so yeah it's a maro Oh

3063.009 --> 3068.619
crazy cat lady fear porn yeah very part

3067.839 --> 3070.9
everywhere

3068.619 --> 3074.949
anything can be turned into fear porn

3070.9 --> 3076.599
anything and they have and you didn't

3074.949 --> 3078.91
even notice it as they were doing it

3076.599 --> 3082.1800000000003
because she got so used to it you didn't

3078.91 --> 3086.019
even realize that maybe fear of porn is

3082.18 --> 3090.3999999999996
not a reasonable angle to approach

3086.019 --> 3096.249
things I fell for that trap to like ten

3090.4 --> 3098.67
years ago first but we should get over

3096.249 --> 3098.6699999999996
that now

3115.16 --> 3130.79
sure Amanda you no reason to stop no no

3124.41 --> 3134.54
Oakley's not life that's a premier

3130.79 --> 3134.54
should know better than that

3136.67 --> 3142.46
but it's not even premier it just

3139.02 --> 3142.46
uploaded something that's it

3169.53 --> 3175.599
charging for a wrong thing that's too

3172.089 --> 3182.339
terrible but yes they've tried I still

3175.599 --> 3185.6800000000003
remember the that [ __ ] the wrong thing

3182.339 --> 3188.89
that really became something like after

3185.68 --> 3192.3089999999997
Obama came in office that's when things

3188.89 --> 3194.92
got bad and the Netherlands including in

3192.309 --> 3200.5890000000004
much of Europe was then subjected to

3194.92 --> 3203.41
that approach to enforce a social

3200.589 --> 3208.24
engineering effect upon everyone and I

3203.41 --> 3216.0099999999998
was horrified by this so badly that you

3208.24 --> 3218.5299999999997
know I hate it I hate that they did that

3216.01 --> 3225.059
and I will do anything in my power to

3218.53 --> 3230.02
get it out of the way to make being good

3225.059 --> 3234.3590000000004
really good make good good again and let

3230.02 --> 3239.64
evil be evil and don't don't

3234.359 --> 3241.0
unnaturally force us to accept things I

3239.64 --> 3245.92
hate it

3241.0 --> 3248.5
I loathe it I can't stand that people do

3245.92 --> 3252.119
that but it's were even worse that

3248.5 --> 3252.119
people do it to themselves

3254.05 --> 3257.4390000000003
[Music]

3278.31 --> 3283.61
what are you talking about peanuts Clark

3280.71 --> 3283.61
what is Coppa

3307.18 --> 3311.74
okay there's some perceived panic Oh for

3310.33 --> 3313.45
that everything will be taken down

3311.74 --> 3316.2599999999998
peanuts Clark so can you be more

3313.45 --> 3316.2599999999998
elaborate please

3345.5 --> 3348.34
okay

3349.15 --> 3351.869
all right

3353.74 --> 3361.5989999999997
well gleam yeah well technically I have

3357.88 --> 3364.06
one video aimed at kids and it was kind

3361.599 --> 3366.099
of stupid it was just me it was like my

3364.06 --> 3369.46
first video and it was the flat cat

3366.099 --> 3373.3300000000004
thing and like if they're gonna say you

3369.46 --> 3376.0
gotta take this down then oh yeah sure

3373.33 --> 3378.0989999999997
it was kind of stupid in my personal so

3376.0 --> 3382.69
many people thought it was kind of cute

3378.099 --> 3388.3
I guess it was harmless enough it's just

3382.69 --> 3392.38
playing in my mind game to kind of like

3388.3 --> 3393.6090000000004
make it easy but yeah if that has to be

3392.38 --> 3395.8
taken down okay

3393.609 --> 3400.66
sure but everything else that I've done

3395.8 --> 3403.21
is I've always aimed my my information

3400.66 --> 3408.8489999999997
in my what I do the lessons that I teach

3403.21 --> 3413.71
pretty much it I guess average 12 year

3408.849 --> 3419.4100000000003
old and older or maybe younger too but

3413.71 --> 3422.4900000000002
yeah look I do sometimes let myself go

3419.41 --> 3426.67
and I guess that that is considered like

3422.49 --> 3429.3689999999997
unacceptable ever or whatever and with

3426.67 --> 3434.589
certain episodes like 82 yeah I

3429.369 --> 3439.21
definitely put a what is it what is it

3434.589 --> 3442.75
pg-13 label on that if I could hey if

3439.21 --> 3446.32
youtube allows me to just have like

3442.75 --> 3449.44
these buttons in yeah in the life

3446.32 --> 3452.56
dashboard thank you very much YouTube if

3449.44 --> 3455.65
you can do that you can basically save a

3452.56 --> 3461.32
lot of content so you can keep on going

3455.65 --> 3466.03
and not just crash and write this then

3461.32 --> 3471.73
yeah put put labels in there like pg-13

3466.03 --> 3475.78
or just PG or r-rated what it whatever

3471.73 --> 3479.23
whatever system just a click system and

3475.78 --> 3481.8
who knows it yeah moderators could be

3479.23 --> 3486.39
able to just reinforce that or whatever

3481.8 --> 3488.9700000000003
but then it's fixed very quickly

3486.39 --> 3491.2799999999997
and you can attune your algorithm search

3488.97 --> 3495.35
algorithms and all that very easily

3491.28 --> 3498.63
without even changing anything much so

3495.35 --> 3502.29
get that done please YouTube crowds

3498.63 --> 3504.54
people programmers planners executives

3502.29 --> 3508.52
please stop being concerned about

3504.54 --> 3511.52
politics and actually fix the works

3508.52 --> 3511.52
please

3554.43 --> 3562.279
that's weird

3557.169 --> 3566.779
the potential to attract children so the

3562.279 --> 3569.449
it sounds kind of vague anyway the

3566.779 --> 3573.169
potential to attract I what does that

3569.449 --> 3576.109
mean that if anything is appealing about

3573.169 --> 3579.979
it to a child like how is that

3576.109 --> 3583.179
determined what children are they using

3579.979 --> 3590.7189999999996
to panel that or something I don't know

3583.179 --> 3594.65
I look personally I am NOT even against

3590.719 --> 3597.38
having optional systems within internet

3594.65 --> 3604.7490000000003
like kind of like there was with TV

3597.38 --> 3604.7490000000003
first with age ranging because it yeah

3606.369 --> 3613.5190000000002
you can't literally just let children

3610.4 --> 3616.699
potentially look the problem is is

3613.519 --> 3620.4489999999996
everybody so and tangled with this world

3616.699 --> 3622.969
that it's become much easier and it's

3620.449 --> 3625.64
easily indulged also when parents lose

3622.969 --> 3629.299
track of what their children do and then

3625.64 --> 3631.189
they just go with some on some adventure

3629.299 --> 3633.829
dive on the internet and then are

3631.189 --> 3636.4089999999997
subjected to potentially horrific things

3633.829 --> 3640.9390000000003
they see their because they are on the

3636.409 --> 3643.069
internet as well for some reason or just

3640.939 --> 3646.5789999999997
hearing things that they were not ready

3643.069 --> 3648.979
to handle we not had it ready and that's

3646.579 --> 3651.409
yeah that could be a bad thing and it's

3648.979 --> 3657.769
not worth shutting down free speech for

3651.409 --> 3660.4390000000003
of course but yeah just some basic

3657.769 --> 3663.1989999999996
safeguards and again the parental

3660.439 --> 3667.839
guidence idea if it's it's relevant you

3663.199 --> 3670.969
know if a very young kid gets the see

3667.839 --> 3673.699
have the material that it's like

3670.969 --> 3675.469
impactful for them especially for their

3673.699 --> 3677.329
later life or something it's it's kind

3675.469 --> 3681.039
of important that there's a parent there

3677.329 --> 3684.799
to make them feel safe or whatever and

3681.039 --> 3687.0
to answer their questions so they can

3684.799 --> 3689.28
assimilate it better

3687.0 --> 3691.92
and to be the judge of whether they

3689.28 --> 3695.4300000000003
should see something I don't know I am

3691.92 --> 3697.9500000000003
for that I appreciated that greatly when

3695.43 --> 3699.93
my parents did that that they at least

3697.95 --> 3704.6899999999996
did that with me at first when I was

3699.93 --> 3708.4199999999996
young because I was very sensitive now

3704.69 --> 3709.11
their judgement in all directions wasn't

3708.42 --> 3712.08
perfect

3709.11 --> 3714.26
in retrospect but at least they tried to

3712.08 --> 3718.14
be careful with me and that's the issue

3714.26 --> 3719.6000000000004
so I'm not against having some kind of

3718.14 --> 3723.3599999999997
yeah

3719.6 --> 3725.7
age system in there there's already by

3723.36 --> 3729.9300000000003
the way like I think there was at least

3725.7 --> 3733.89
like you have to with certain videos you

3729.93 --> 3736.77
have to prove you are 18 when it's like

3733.89 --> 3741.5899999999997
really heavy [ __ ] and otherwise she just

3736.77 --> 3741.59
can't get in there but yeah I don't know

3743.63 --> 3752.13
maybe I'm not I'm just not entirely

3748.77 --> 3758.4
against this I am against being

3752.13 --> 3763.8
subjected to censorship abusing the

3758.4 --> 3764.79
excuse of parental thingies concerns

3763.8 --> 3767.4300000000003
about children

3764.79 --> 3769.17
it could be abused oh yeah that's

3767.43 --> 3771.45
dangerous who is in control what is

3769.17 --> 3775.4900000000002
their agenda to do with that but as a

3771.45 --> 3780.18
general concept it's a general age

3775.49 --> 3782.9399999999996
safeguard system I'm not really against

3780.18 --> 3785.3999999999996
it but yeah who's who's up who's

3782.94 --> 3785.73
implementing it what are they doing with

3785.4 --> 3788.25
it

3785.73 --> 3789.84
are they really gonna be honest and fair

3788.25 --> 3791.97
and really just trying to help

3789.84 --> 3794.01
or are they literally going to use it

3791.97 --> 3796.5299999999997
for a political censorship some kind

3794.01 --> 3801.21
yeah that is a big issue

3796.53 --> 3804.21
it's a tough it's a tough situation so

3801.21 --> 3807.95
we have to be vigilant very very

3804.21 --> 3807.95
vigilant very careful

3855.52 --> 3863.8
what Laurie stop it are you are you

3860.77 --> 3866.8
soliciting to get banned because if you

3863.8 --> 3867.9700000000003
keep this up you're gonna be I don't

3866.8 --> 3871.8
want to you've been hanging around

3867.97 --> 3875.35
please just don't go there okay

3871.8 --> 3877.65
it's the second time out don't do that

3875.35 --> 3877.65
again please

3911.98 --> 3920.27
curated searching problematic no Robin

3915.17 --> 3922.369
Stanley I don't know look it's just a

3920.27 --> 3927.52
framework in all the pans and how it's

3922.369 --> 3927.52
gonna be used you know

3941.02 --> 3944.49
public libraries

3945.329 --> 3953.4100000000003
right well Robin Stanley in public

3948.88 --> 3956.289
libraries that if I'm correct that is

3953.41 --> 3958.359
accessible to children I think you don't

3956.289 --> 3961.63
have to necessarily be adult to get in

3958.359 --> 3966.069
there pretty sure I don't know how

3961.63 --> 3970.65
either of course so yeah there should be

3966.069 --> 3970.65
some safeguard of course

3977.53 --> 3982.4500000000003
or at least somebody that just keeps an

3980.47 --> 3984.85
eye on like hey there's a caterer make

3982.45 --> 3987.96
sure he doesn't go to like the horror

3984.85 --> 3995.44
section or whatever it is or whatever

3987.96 --> 3999.93
type of doesn't grab book about about

3995.44 --> 3999.93
some historical terrible war or whatever

4000.8 --> 4016.25
yeah so whatever but see consulting and

4010.23 --> 4016.25
Ulta for the job okay

4017.21 --> 4022.599
oh my god well Cleary that's so terrible

4026.589 --> 4036.74
yeah they all know that seriously I

4029.96 --> 4039.2
don't really mind you know again this is

4036.74 --> 4041.72
my I guess it's not a very popular

4039.2 --> 4044.0299999999997
stance but I'm just like and look if you

4041.72 --> 4049.5099999999998
really think you're gay or whatever on

4044.03 --> 4052.63
trends you know if that's where you are

4049.51 --> 4058.369
that's what you think you need to do

4052.63 --> 4064.099
I'll talk about it with you but yeah I

4058.369 --> 4066.589
don't mind but what I don't like if that

4064.099 --> 4069.619
is the only freaking thing you're

4066.589 --> 4071.869
talking about now if it's constantly on

4069.619 --> 4074.75
this arm that all because I am this that

4071.869 --> 4078.4100000000003
because now that is freaking annoying

4074.75 --> 4084.29
that is something I don't want but hey

4078.41 --> 4091.39
if your yeah whatever I'm fine just

4084.29 --> 4094.599
don't nag me with that please that's it

4091.39 --> 4094.5989999999997
so yeah

4097.029 --> 4102.620000000001
although yeah in a way look as you said

4100.31 --> 4104.96
it is aimed for for children

4102.62 --> 4107.21
specifically so that does kind of bring

4104.96 --> 4110.42
it in a bit shady territory and it's up

4107.21 --> 4114.859
to the parents to decide is that

4110.42 --> 4117.109
acceptable or is it not are you ready to

4114.859 --> 4121.4890000000005
explain to your kid what that's supposed

4117.109 --> 4124.27
to be or do you think he's he or she is

4121.489 --> 4124.2699999999995
too young for it

4133.37 --> 4138.48
yeah ESP power one one seven yeah that

4136.95 --> 4145.589
is just terrible yeah I know

4138.48 --> 4147.889999999999
like seriously trans children is I just

4145.589 --> 4147.89
can't

4156.43 --> 4165.900000000001
yeah that's that that's too far for me

4159.3 --> 4171.43
it does indeed feel like depopulation I

4165.9 --> 4173.86
know I wasn't met and it wasn't

4171.43 --> 4176.17
referring to that you know I don't think

4173.86 --> 4178.83
that acceptance of that kind of thing is

4176.17 --> 4187.33
something that should ever be promoted

4178.83 --> 4191.62
really you know ya wanna mutilate

4187.33 --> 4194.92
yourself or whatever you know I don't

4191.62 --> 4198.3099999999995
think anyone should do that but as a

4194.92 --> 4203.35
child you just don't understand what the

4198.31 --> 4209.490000000001
hell you're doing that can't be approved

4203.35 --> 4209.490000000001
I would never approve that

4215.38 --> 4218.01
yeah

4245.539 --> 4250.059
I know I know peanuts Clark

4261.8 --> 4271.59
[Music]

4264.419 --> 4274.199
yep Julie Bennett I know it's look I am

4271.59 --> 4277.229
like as everybody knows I'm almost

4274.199 --> 4282.659
compulsively tolerant and this is just

4277.229 --> 4285.809
one of the things where I just I can't

4282.659 --> 4289.32
fade I can't face it there's nothing

4285.809 --> 4293.28
about it that makes me says but maybe mm

4289.32 --> 4303.659
I can't do it just nothing there it's

4293.28 --> 4309.209
it's just wrong and it's on the parents

4303.659 --> 4311.429
really 3d is whatever their excuse may

4309.209 --> 4327.959
be peer pressure delusion it is on the

4311.429 --> 4329.2
parents it is anyway yeah I don't like

4327.959 --> 4336.04
talking about this

4329.2 --> 4336.04
[Music]

4352.17 --> 4355.17
Laurey

4362.6 --> 4371.320000000001
stop attacking people in my chat stop

4367.97 --> 4371.320000000001
calling everybody liars

4395.32 --> 4400.45
hmm oh it's by the way I think I'm I

4397.87 --> 4403.9
missed a super chat earth is seriously

4400.45 --> 4405.7
flat donate a $2.00 super chat donation

4403.9 --> 4408.61
earlier thank you by the way for for

4405.7 --> 4412.5599999999995
that happy flatter day let's unite and

4408.61 --> 4412.5599999999995
in the globe zombies okay

4430.98 --> 4434.139999999999
[Music]

4450.09 --> 4452.75
yeah

4452.849 --> 4461.82
but anyway back to the whole yeah for a

4456.48 --> 4470.579
minute if I'd have to designate my oh my

4461.82 --> 4478.86
early bird shows and I guess I'd say

4470.579 --> 4484.53
okay most of them will be either just PG

4478.86 --> 4488.848999999999
so or or pg-13 when I get like really

4484.53 --> 4491.909
angry and start cursing that bad curse

4488.849 --> 4498.139
words this is and that's that's roughly

4491.909 --> 4501.989
it so I'm yeah I'm just saying out loud

4498.139 --> 4507.29
my content is not just overtly meant for

4501.989 --> 4510.0
children that's not the case and that

4507.29 --> 4512.61
doesn't mean that I am not meant for

4510.0 --> 4517.829
children because if I would be facing a

4512.61 --> 4520.348999999999
child then I could definitely just size

4517.829 --> 4525.0599999999995
up okay where are they at mentally you

4520.349 --> 4528.42
know that what could I teach them a

4525.06 --> 4530.6990000000005
basic thing even or whatever so but yeah

4528.42 --> 4533.34
when I am doing a video then I can of

4530.699 --> 4535.589999999999
course see who's actually seeing my face

4533.34 --> 4539.400000000001
and I'm telling you to band everyone

4535.59 --> 4541.2300000000005
yeah my work is not just meant for

4539.4 --> 4544.098999999999
children outright it's you're not

4541.23 --> 4548.15
supposed to put the early bird show on

4544.099 --> 4551.849
with your little kid and just walk away

4548.15 --> 4553.7699999999995
I'm doing my best nevertheless but

4551.849 --> 4558.5
that's not what this show was meant for

4553.77 --> 4561.5
it is kind of directed at adults or

4558.5 --> 4561.5
teenagers

4564.5 --> 4573.48
but yeah roughly pg-13 would would

4570.33 --> 4576.3
always work according to the old

4573.48 --> 4580.139999999999
principle that like what does that mean

4576.3 --> 4583.92
these days but yeah the idea of that

4580.14 --> 4586.2300000000005
just saying so yeah please don't take

4583.92 --> 4589.2300000000005
down my entire channel because I'm not

4586.23 --> 4593.33
refusing to use that broken system you

4589.23 --> 4598.139999999999
present it in order to do that okay just

4593.33 --> 4600.57
help work it out with the old systems

4598.14 --> 4604.4400000000005
that actually work like the life

4600.57 --> 4606.679999999999
dashboard be very nice you could just do

4604.44 --> 4606.679999999999
that

4614.69 --> 4619.219999999999
and if even if that means that I'm gonna

4617.15 --> 4623.389999999999
have to go back to like every video I

4619.22 --> 4626.780000000001
ever made and then select something yes

4623.39 --> 4627.62
it's annoying but I'll do that I'll be

4626.78 --> 4630.92
okay with that

4627.62 --> 4634.22
and fortunately I don't have like 10,000

4630.92 --> 4636.35
shows or anything so it would be better

4634.22 --> 4638.96
if it would just be Auto designated and

4636.35 --> 4641.63
then changeable so you at least have

4638.96 --> 4645.65
something filled in whatever I don't

4641.63 --> 4665.21
know yeah that too technical but yeah

4645.65 --> 4670.54
yeah Adam coming back stallion ninety

4665.21 --> 4670.54
eighty twelve yeah doing okay

4681.06 --> 4687.370000000001
no mark colored in my life dashboard

4684.34 --> 4690.91
there is no there is no designation for

4687.37 --> 4694.99
age category but in the special section

4690.91 --> 4698.95
you can say like adult content and that

4694.99 --> 4701.53
that means like that's pretty bad that's

4698.95 --> 4704.53
like sexual in nature or something like

4701.53 --> 4713.0199999999995
that I think that's what that was always

4704.53 --> 4714.4
for I don't know but is that what it's

4713.02 --> 4718.39
supposed to be I'm supposed to flag

4714.4 --> 4721.71
every single thing as being adult like

4718.39 --> 4721.71
that is that what they expect

4763.72 --> 4769.689
[Music]

4765.329 --> 4771.999
all right okay

4769.689 --> 4774.309
sir check oh well I think I think they

4771.999 --> 4776.909
might be like that but I have I have no

4774.309 --> 4776.909000000001
problem with that

4802.14 --> 4809.410000000001
[Music]

4804.7 --> 4809.41
you know Stacy be

4814.13 --> 4820.849
right so check oh well the up is some

4818.42 --> 4823.639
episodes especially when I raged badly

4820.849 --> 4828.2300000000005
they do get well that really flag they

4823.639 --> 4830.900000000001
get they all they get like put on risk

4828.23 --> 4834.5599999999995
notice for D monetization it just says

4830.9 --> 4837.4
this is not good for some advertisers

4834.56 --> 4841.150000000001
that disagree with something about it

4837.4 --> 4846.369
they still are they still do Getty

4841.15 --> 4848.629999999999
advertisements and yeah in the past some

4846.369 --> 4851.449
specific episodes were taken down

4848.63 --> 4857.329
because they had the title in them that

4851.449 --> 4861.29
were related to yeah to like shootings

4857.329 --> 4864.549999999999
and all that and they definitely like to

4861.29 --> 4868.19
take it down if it is overtly about that

4864.55 --> 4870.4400000000005
but other than that now barely haven't

4868.19 --> 4874.48
YouTube barely seems to have any issues

4870.44 --> 4874.48
with what I do a in the way that I do it

4910.79 --> 4919.61
selected a default or Cleary I don't

4914.77 --> 4923.570000000001
have that default as far as I could see

4919.61 --> 4926.049999999999
you know what I'll try to double check

4923.57 --> 4926.049999999999
it

4935.88 --> 4943.58
monetization

4938.39 --> 4943.58
more advanced settings

4948.74 --> 4955.58
the trick is it that the enable age

4951.86 --> 4958.45
restriction French underage usage from

4955.58 --> 4958.45
watching anything else

4964.99 --> 4967.65
right

4970.51 --> 4973.71
so it is that

4980.21 --> 4987.8
I don't know I'm gonna have to have more

4982.97 --> 4991.070000000001
communications about this because to

4987.8 --> 4993.8
just start up with default this is not

4991.07 --> 4997.5199999999995
going to be proper for a certain age I

4993.8 --> 4999.53
just I can't really tell it it also

4997.52 --> 5001.81
depends on what people are going to

4999.53 --> 5004.2
insert as subjects in the Hangout and

5001.81 --> 5004.200000000001
all that

5028.139 --> 5039.17
okay that is weird it's already saying

5030.719 --> 5039.17
apparently about this show it's limited

5040.46 --> 5045.3
because it's not suitable for most

5043.26 --> 5048.42
advertiser so I don't know why but

5045.3 --> 5051.119000000001
apparently this video has at least

5048.42 --> 5052.469
temporarily been flaggers that they sell

5051.119 --> 5056.4
something wrong with it I don't know

5052.469 --> 5059.79
what did I say wrong I've been so

5056.4 --> 5065.57
extremely nice the whole show what what

5059.79 --> 5068.969
ever did I say what is it that I said

5065.57 --> 5073.0199999999995
that I can't figure out anything that

5068.969 --> 5076.409
made that justifies children to be

5073.02 --> 5078.92
subjected to transsexual surgery or

5076.409 --> 5083.79
anything was that it is that just a

5078.92 --> 5085.53
forbidden I'm not even saying anything

5083.79 --> 5088.219
about him just saying I can personally

5085.53 --> 5095.79
find anything that could justify it

5088.219 --> 5100.71
that's my opinion on it the title what

5095.79 --> 5104.15
title it the title of my show is just

5100.71 --> 5104.15
called flat earth early bird

5110.099 --> 5116.1900000000005
that no now that doesn't make any sense

5113.34 --> 5116.79
because every show is called Flat Earth

5116.19 --> 5121.7699999999995
early-bird

5116.79 --> 5124.86
this is now 368 and yeah most of them

5121.77 --> 5127.34
didn't have this flag situation going on

5124.86 --> 5127.339999999999
at all

5149.989 --> 5160.099999999999
it's are you serious Cleary no I don't

5155.0 --> 5163.85
think so I'm pretty sure that they don't

5160.1 --> 5171.14
flag you for not saying it is a flying

5163.85 --> 5174.35
tilted spinning water ball I'm pretty

5171.14 --> 5182.14
sure that doesn't really matter a lot in

5174.35 --> 5182.14
a direct sense hey what's that

5182.3 --> 5185.419
[Music]

5185.59 --> 5190.9890000000005
alright good Tim so uh where are you

5188.45 --> 5190.989
sending it

5195.15 --> 5198.4
[Music]

5201.07 --> 5206.969999999999
[Music]

5206.979 --> 5215.9490000000005
no Stacy b-but that's incorrect because

5210.969 --> 5220.11
my title it says Flat Earth it's not

5215.949 --> 5223.268999999999
claiming anything it's just Flat Earth

5220.11 --> 5227.009999999999
you know and my personal opinions are

5223.269 --> 5228.959
not in the title it's just flat earth

5227.01 --> 5232.92
that's it

5228.959 --> 5237.809
it's in a concept it's an idea it's a an

5232.92 --> 5237.809
angle of approach to the situation

5255.449 --> 5264.78
now look if the title would be the earth

5259.32 --> 5266.549999999999
is flat for example now yeah hey why not

5264.78 --> 5270.9
there's been people doing that but that

5266.55 --> 5274.469
would be like a literal kind of overt

5270.9 --> 5278.46
claim in the title now I from their new

5274.469 --> 5280.35
nitty nitpicky nonsense censorship and

5278.46 --> 5283.65
they just love their whining complaining

5280.35 --> 5286.92
pants about Flat Earth and all that yeah

5283.65 --> 5289.44
I get that maybe then they have like big

5286.92 --> 5292.53
issues with that but it's just a title

5289.44 --> 5298.83
of the freakin show Flat Earth early

5292.53 --> 5303.32
bird it's never anything different the

5298.83 --> 5303.32
the show title so I did I didn't see it

5305.42 --> 5310.469
right

5306.69 --> 5312.599999999999
peanuts Clark that could be indeed look

5310.469 --> 5315.06
it's happened before that what remember

5312.6 --> 5319.320000000001
that there was this one show where I did

5315.06 --> 5321.360000000001
get really pissed off with the what is

5319.32 --> 5323.429
it when was claimed that Pascal's law

5321.36 --> 5328.53
this proves the gradient now that when

5323.429 --> 5332.6990000000005
was it last Monday and that seemed to

5328.53 --> 5337.11
have a monetization flag and then later

5332.699 --> 5339.0
like after two hours it just poof no it

5337.11 --> 5342.36
was everything was fine so I don't know

5339.0 --> 5347.01
exactly what what's going on but I've

5342.36 --> 5349.29
never had any direct overt like oh how

5347.01 --> 5358.26
dare you you're gonna die seriously I've

5349.29 --> 5361.14
never ever had a strike and now I've

5358.26 --> 5363.6
always kind of like never really tried

5361.14 --> 5366.4490000000005
to get a strike I'd never be like I'm

5363.6 --> 5367.77
gonna go all the way no matter the cost

5366.449 --> 5370.678999999999
kind of [ __ ]

5367.77 --> 5374.34
just grab as much attention that's all

5370.679 --> 5377.4
no that's never been my strategy so I

5374.34 --> 5379.860000000001
guess that's why I've never gotten the

5377.4 --> 5383.61
strike I don't know I I don't have any

5379.86 --> 5388.32
direct verbal contact or communications

5383.61 --> 5393.509999999999
or like email interactions with YouTube

5388.32 --> 5395.849
just zero none whatsoever I have no idea

5393.51 --> 5401.46
what they actually think of what I do

5395.849 --> 5404.519
are what category they sized me up as or

5401.46 --> 5407.55
whatever what they want from me I don't

5404.519 --> 5411.360000000001
know I'm just going into my intuition

5407.55 --> 5413.869000000001
and listening around and being honest

5411.36 --> 5413.869
and straightforward

5415.98 --> 5418.848999999999
No

5428.01 --> 5431.84
no there's no strike one

5445.469 --> 5449.519
okay how do I get there

5462.109 --> 5467.780000000001
I need to dig into something

5485.68 --> 5491.02
yeah and I need a break for a minutes be

5488.66 --> 5491.0199999999995
right back

5593.99 --> 5598.46
you got that back

5607.24 --> 5610.24
right

5615.92 --> 5626.4490000000005
all right so yeah no no strikes

5622.85 --> 5634.84
no copyright strikes no Community

5626.449 --> 5634.839999999999
Guidelines strikes zero so yeah

5648.52 --> 5654.469
we are in the

5650.59 --> 5664.929
antidisestablishmentarianism category

5654.469 --> 5664.929
okay yes that's correct

5682.469 --> 5687.18
yeah but fine each I never got struck

5684.9 --> 5690.599999999999
for that because I literally deleted the

5687.18 --> 5692.13
hangout when that happened and then it

5690.6 --> 5697.67
never gets to a strike

5692.13 --> 5697.67
I was very quick

5699.76 --> 5702.959
[Music]

5707.71 --> 5712.149
[Music]

5743.24 --> 5746.3189999999995
[Music]

5756.3 --> 5758.3
Oh

5765.81 --> 5768.869000000001
[Music]

5797.96 --> 5804.08
hmm hello sorry to Cosentino what are

5801.59 --> 5807.59
you matching the second show yeah I was

5804.08 --> 5811.2699999999995
there I was there till very late even

5807.59 --> 5811.27
after the after show so

5829.04 --> 5832.51
that's not a crossbow

5869.819 --> 5875.019
all right yeah more colored yeah if if

5873.669 --> 5879.369
that is what he meant

5875.019 --> 5883.629
yeah they I had trouble finding the show

5879.369 --> 5886.688999999999
stream even though I was on it on the

5883.629 --> 5888.639
panel and I had like had to dig manually

5886.689 --> 5895.119000000001
through YouTube through the channels to

5888.639 --> 5899.379
find it took me like 10 minutes because

5895.119 --> 5901.209
I just couldn't get to to the actual

5899.379 --> 5903.099
live stream from the YouTube side it

5901.209 --> 5910.769
just didn't didn't show it to me

5903.099 --> 5910.769
oh alright good Tim Rowe thanks

5917.27 --> 5920.1
okay thank you for that I'll check it

5919.77 --> 5926.6900000000005
out

5920.1 --> 5926.6900000000005
but after the show thank you for that

5931.499 --> 5938.969
yeah while sorry took Sarita Cosentino

5935.249 --> 5941.159
so my and I get like the notification

5938.969 --> 5946.59
system for nathan's channels are just

5941.159 --> 5949.469
completely wrecked at this point in the

5946.59 --> 5952.019
sense well not totally it's just that

5949.469 --> 5956.099
sometimes it just totally does not work

5952.019 --> 5960.229
and other days it's just fine so there's

5956.099 --> 5960.229
there screwing around with it

5962.67 --> 5968.87
[Music]

5994.59 --> 5999.77
it's just silly any more geeky Mart

6000.07 --> 6003.07
really

6020.619 --> 6029.409
no hurry second that's not the case no

6024.46 --> 6031.15
no that's the thing a gradient within

6029.409 --> 6034.869
the gas pressure within a container

6031.15 --> 6038.5599999999995
there's never a perfect vacuum present

6034.869 --> 6040.69
at any point they're simply division

6038.56 --> 6044.610000000001
between higher pressure and lower

6040.69 --> 6048.25
pressures and in a limited spectrum and

6044.61 --> 6052.53
with the wider the dimensions of the

6048.25 --> 6066.909
container becomes then potentially be

6052.53 --> 6072.099
more I guess the bigger the spectrum the

6066.909 --> 6074.679
further the gradient will start to go

6072.099 --> 6076.860000000001
apart so potentially if there's extreme

6074.679 --> 6080.83
Heights well there may be something

6076.86 --> 6082.42
almost close to kind of a vacuum but

6080.83 --> 6086.4
that would be because of the wide

6082.42 --> 6089.88
dimension of it there's never gonna be

6086.4 --> 6094.33
endless amounts of more vacuum

6089.88 --> 6096.46
surrounding the supposed earth realm

6094.33 --> 6097.869
which is relatively small to what is

6096.46 --> 6099.88
pretty supposed to be out there as a

6097.869 --> 6103.54
vacuum that can never be that's not how

6099.88 --> 6109.469
a gradient works can never keep on

6103.54 --> 6111.55
graduating at this very small spot into

6109.469 --> 6113.77
eternal vastness that's not how a

6111.55 --> 6116.110000000001
gradient worker gradient always settles

6113.77 --> 6121.889
within the entirety of the container and

6116.11 --> 6126.5199999999995
there's no extreme radiation in

6121.889 --> 6130.75
extremely vast space in an extremely

6126.52 --> 6135.01
fast container that doesn't work that

6130.75 --> 6137.5
way it does spread out the gradient is

6135.01 --> 6139.4800000000005
always going to be somewhere in the

6137.5 --> 6142.48
middle and the bigger the container the

6139.48 --> 6148.839999999999
more steep the gradient will be but it's

6142.48 --> 6151.089999999999
it can never be such a small part where

6148.84 --> 6152.329
there is a relatively big pressure

6151.09 --> 6154.82
gradient then

6152.329 --> 6157.929
into eternity like an asymptote that

6154.82 --> 6157.929
cannot happen

6162.64 --> 6170.83
the pressure gradients always going to

6164.77 --> 6175.6
be sitting somewhere in between the the

6170.83 --> 6177.37
two extremities of the container always

6175.6 --> 6182.620000000001
going to be in between in the vaster the

6177.37 --> 6184.69
volume the more pronounced the gradient

6182.62 --> 6193.8099999999995
will be that's it that's the word I was

6184.69 --> 6196.78
looking for right Philip Cooper oh I

6193.81 --> 6200.2300000000005
know because exactly why I explained of

6196.78 --> 6203.65
the nature of gradients how it is

6200.23 --> 6207.639999999999
directly interconnected to the spatial

6203.65 --> 6212.799999999999
volume of this supposed container it's a

6207.64 --> 6215.950000000001
direct it's a Delta so yeah if you

6212.8 --> 6221.05
presume that the container would be the

6215.95 --> 6223.63
outer space and all that they'd gradient

6221.05 --> 6226.33
as we know it right here in this realm

6223.63 --> 6231.900000000001
could never be like that because the

6226.33 --> 6234.5199999999995
volume would be so excessive that ya

6231.9 --> 6236.7699999999995
could never come to that level of

6234.52 --> 6240.81
pressure within such a vast container in

6236.77 --> 6240.81
such a small space it's impossible

6243.93 --> 6254.400000000001
that's not how gradiation works yeah

6252.15 --> 6258.23
every second it's right here you're

6254.4 --> 6258.23
sitting in it that's why you can breathe

6273.619 --> 6281.57
yeah that's exactly what I'm telling you

6277.52 --> 6284.42
[ __ ] Harry's a [ __ ] you're sitting in

6281.57 --> 6289.099
it that's why you can breathe there was

6284.42 --> 6292.369
no container if or if it was UniFirst

6289.099 --> 6295.52
sized container yet there would be no

6292.369 --> 6298.3099999999995
buildup of gas pressure on this small

6295.52 --> 6300.71
piece within that container in order for

6298.31 --> 6302.929
you to breathe it would spread out

6300.71 --> 6305.2390000000005
within the entirety of container and

6302.929 --> 6308.54
then maybe form some gradient but that

6305.239 --> 6310.759999999999
gradient it would either mean the

6308.54 --> 6313.67
entirety of outer space of that entire

6310.76 --> 6316.13
universe is filled up with gas to a

6313.67 --> 6318.11
similar level as we experience it or

6316.13 --> 6320.599
there would be no gas it would all be

6318.11 --> 6325.639
spread out so thinly that literally you

6320.599 --> 6328.75
wouldn't be able to breathe so yeah it's

6325.639 --> 6328.75
natural consequence

6333.67 --> 6340.1900000000005
[Music]

6336.85 --> 6343.450000000001
right sorry to Cosentino and the dynamic

6340.19 --> 6347.2699999999995
system in the realm prevents it from

6343.45 --> 6349.73
yeah for everything from settling to and

6347.27 --> 6351.17
to further gases to start naturally

6349.73 --> 6353.36
separating because it's constantly

6351.17 --> 6356.24
moving so therefore the atmosphere right

6353.36 --> 6360.88
here is inhomogeneous still subjected

6356.24 --> 6366.139999999999
the mass of it to relative density and

6360.88 --> 6368.51
potentially other effects like a station

6366.14 --> 6370.490000000001
is mysterious

6368.51 --> 6378.38
it's like polarization effect or

6370.49 --> 6382.55
whatever but yeah that mash of gas

6378.38 --> 6384.650000000001
pressure that is breathable to us exists

6382.55 --> 6387.47
here and there's like less atmosphere

6384.65 --> 6391.25
higher up because there's a gradiation

6387.47 --> 6395.51
and that gradiation because of how

6391.25 --> 6398.38
gradients work can never from well from

6395.51 --> 6402.71
the measured point um continue on for

6398.38 --> 6403.46
astronomical distances with even less

6402.71 --> 6406.61
pressure

6403.46 --> 6409.58
that's not how gradients work gradients

6406.61 --> 6412.339999999999
are always spread out throughout the

6409.58 --> 6414.26
entirety of the container first the gas

6412.34 --> 6418.04
pressure spreads out in a container and

6414.26 --> 6420.2
then to certain degree as yeah depending

6418.04 --> 6424.28
on how dynamic the actual system is

6420.2 --> 6428.389999999999
within that container the gas pressures

6424.28 --> 6431.509999999999
will start to gradiate with less dense

6428.39 --> 6433.400000000001
on top and denser at the bottom also

6431.51 --> 6439.070000000001
depending on the distribution of heat

6433.4 --> 6441.11
and all that so yeah it's never gonna be

6439.07 --> 6443.33
oh look the gradient the gas pressure

6441.11 --> 6445.339999999999
gradients like this you had to make

6443.33 --> 6449.51
sense so then we're gonna conclude that

6445.34 --> 6451.52
over there which makes this the gas

6449.51 --> 6454.9400000000005
pressure gradient on their earth like

6451.52 --> 6458.3
this compared to the entire room or a

6454.94 --> 6459.73
thousand times more that's not how a

6458.3 --> 6462.9400000000005
gradient works

6459.73 --> 6473.69
that's not never how it works

6462.94 --> 6476.2699999999995
just saying a gradient is not a gas

6473.69 --> 6480.98
pressure gradient or any type of

6476.27 --> 6484.790000000001
gradient based on entropy spreading out

6480.98 --> 6487.099999999999
settling of fluids it's never an

6484.79 --> 6490.63
asymptote that's not what a gradient is

6487.1 --> 6490.63
like ever

6527.989 --> 6536.259999999999
are you addressing me Philip Cooper are

6531.95 --> 6536.26
you actually addressing me with that

6550.449 --> 6554.678999999999
because I remember you being so you

6553.63 --> 6558.37
could be banned

6554.679 --> 6560.4400000000005
you got me banned please unban me why do

6558.37 --> 6564.64
I deserve it well for saying [ __ ] like

6560.44 --> 6566.62
that like very disgusting arrogant

6564.64 --> 6569.89
statements and like the claim of

6566.62 --> 6571.989
arrogance towards me is the whole thing

6569.89 --> 6574.030000000001
you put out there is so disgusting

6571.989 --> 6578.98
if you'd say that to my face I'd live to

6574.03 --> 6583.29
really slap you in it did you did people

6578.98 --> 6589.349999999999
don't talk to other people like that

6583.29 --> 6589.35
won't you check your your output body

6601.389 --> 6605.58
no Arwen what do you mean no

6612.489 --> 6618.04
I was talking about you that statement

6615.19 --> 6620.53
right here saying things like don't show

6618.04 --> 6623.17
off your ignorance in public think use

6620.53 --> 6629.25
the gray bit buildings on top of your

6623.17 --> 6632.83
neck it's just supremely arrogant and

6629.25 --> 6638.29
ignorant and it's just everything you

6632.83 --> 6639.85
say is just you're literally accusing

6638.29 --> 6643.14
other people of the [ __ ] you're going

6639.85 --> 6643.14
through it's pretty disgusting

6651.22 --> 6658.42
the gradient is very pronounced it's

6655.63 --> 6661.78
very specific I explained it gradients

6658.42 --> 6664.75
consequence there's a gradient it's

6661.78 --> 6668.37
gonna work in a certain way hey if you

6664.75 --> 6671.26
can demonstrate yeah let's let's

6668.37 --> 6674.41
rearrange the housekeeping question

6671.26 --> 6676.27
right only here for now and just say not

6674.41 --> 6679.21
just gas pressure without a container

6676.27 --> 6682.120000000001
because that never happened that never

6679.21 --> 6685.14
makes any sense even though that's kind

6682.12 --> 6692.43
of what is suggested by the globe model

6685.14 --> 6697.5
it's ridiculous but if you can prove a

6692.43 --> 6700.96
gas pressure gradient that is pretty

6697.5 --> 6705.36
extremely pronounced in a certain way in

6700.96 --> 6709.06
a very close tight space next to a huge

6705.36 --> 6712.299999999999
let's let's just start out with hundred

6709.06 --> 6716.56
times or a thousand times larger volume

6712.3 --> 6721.99
surrounding it with less pressure than

6716.56 --> 6724.3
the minimum part of the gradient within

6721.99 --> 6729.94
that small space if you can present me

6724.3 --> 6733.27
that and I mean in any kind of

6729.94 --> 6735.099999999999
imaginable setting although it has to be

6733.27 --> 6736.96
visual so it's not gonna work in like a

6735.1 --> 6741.01
centimeter cube that makes no damn sense

6736.96 --> 6743.58
if you can demonstrate any setup that

6741.01 --> 6746.83
could do that and I'm not even

6743.58 --> 6750.88
interested in doing it on a ball because

6746.83 --> 6756.45
yeah that's but any type of gradients

6750.88 --> 6759.58
that is very pronounced at first and

6756.45 --> 6764.83
then a thousand times a hundred times

6759.58 --> 6767.86
larger volume it continues on without a

6764.83 --> 6770.32
barrier in between from the minimum

6767.86 --> 6772.0599999999995
pressure point of that gradient within

6770.32 --> 6775.41
that small space and it continues on

6772.06 --> 6778.6
through if you can demonstrate a

6775.41 --> 6782.83
gradient a gas pressure gradient of any

6778.6 --> 6784.4400000000005
kind any kind I'd really don't care what

6782.83 --> 6786.18
freaking tricks you're gonna

6784.44 --> 6791.12
pull out of your sleeves with that one

6786.18 --> 6793.77
if you can demonstrate that well then

6791.12 --> 6795.51
then we got something interested but

6793.77 --> 6797.22
yeah I wouldn't ask unless I was

6795.51 --> 6800.150000000001
absolutely certain that that is

6797.22 --> 6803.06
technically if possible no matter what

6800.15 --> 6806.009999999999
because I've never seen any hint

6803.06 --> 6809.54
empirically physically that that can

6806.01 --> 6812.37
happen so yeah good luck with that

6809.54 --> 6814.41
before you start claiming again that it

6812.37 --> 6816.5599999999995
that that is possible that that is how

6814.41 --> 6820.61
the gas pressure gradient can work

6816.56 --> 6825.93
volume yeah with the volume aspect and

6820.61 --> 6828.78
very important that the rest of the

6825.93 --> 6831.84
large volume continues on with the

6828.78 --> 6833.759999999999
lesser pressure in to continue that

6831.84 --> 6840.12
great iam in the supposed asymptote

6833.76 --> 6843.09
shape yeah demonstrate that don't even

6840.12 --> 6848.75
have to do it on the sphere just in

6843.09 --> 6848.75
anyway love to see that

6852.489 --> 6855.299999999999
good luck

6862.609 --> 6872.879000000001
to claim claim claim claim now let's get

6869.55 --> 6875.099
to some evidence please I don't want to

6872.879 --> 6877.53
hear claims anymore of what you think is

6875.099 --> 6879.09
up there I kind of described already

6877.53 --> 6880.739
what you think is up there because I

6879.09 --> 6883.019
know what you think is up there if

6880.739 --> 6884.82
you're a baller but now I'd like to see

6883.019 --> 6890.399
a demonstration that gas pressure

6884.82 --> 6894.959
gradients can in any fashion any fashion

6890.399 --> 6899.09
work that way by demonstrating the setup

6894.959 --> 6899.09
that I explained right before this

6901.609 --> 6908.4490000000005
demonstrate that a gas pressure gradient

6904.05 --> 6908.4490000000005
can work like an asymptote go

6924.33 --> 6928.94
I wasn't talking about a liquid don't

6927.0 --> 6931.83
know I was talking about gas

6928.94 --> 6935.28
specifically not fluids even not liquids

6931.83 --> 6940.58
gas specifically gas that's what's gonna

6935.28 --> 6940.58
be filling the container right

6946.13 --> 6950.66
now there is a gradient there is a

6948.86 --> 6954.349999999999
gradient and it's the gradient that

6950.66 --> 6958.37
naturally arrives within a typical

6954.35 --> 6962.240000000001
container of what this realm must be an

6958.37 --> 6967.76
is specific fashion it's always going to

6962.24 --> 6971.63
be pronounced in a certain region from

6967.76 --> 6978.83
minimum to maximum gradients don't work

6971.63 --> 6982.49
in asymptotes they never get like steep

6978.83 --> 6985.28
and then suddenly go off in two

6982.49 --> 6988.2699999999995
extremities in the distance that's not

6985.28 --> 6991.55
how a gas pressure gradient works ever

6988.27 --> 6993.35
that you can demonstrate that to me not

6991.55 --> 6995.4800000000005
by walking outside and pointing and

6993.35 --> 6998.990000000001
claiming but actually in some kind of

6995.48 --> 7001.57
setup should be too hard not even asking

6998.99 --> 7004.9
you to let it stick to a ball just a

7001.57 --> 7007.5
gradient of gas pressure of any sort any

7004.9 --> 7012.67
combinations of gas I don't care

7007.5 --> 7015.76
anything anything that can demonstrate

7012.67 --> 7021.46
that a gas pressure gradient can be like

7015.76 --> 7024.76
an asymptote okay yeah you can

7021.46 --> 7028.84
demonstrate do it do it show it show it

7024.76 --> 7031.96
the gas pressure gradient can be let's

7028.84 --> 7034.24
say at a bottom of 10 centimeters in

7031.96 --> 7036.01
some kind of container right bottom of

7034.24 --> 7038.29
10 centimeters it's like ooh big

7036.01 --> 7040.06
pressure really big pressure right next

7038.29 --> 7043.66
to it and then it becomes a little less

7040.06 --> 7047.530000000001
and less and then yep significantly

7043.66 --> 7052.12
lower and then right after that 10

7047.53 --> 7056.2
centimeters then the next 10 meters

7052.12 --> 7059.46
above that it's that gradient must then

7056.2 --> 7063.03
continue on from that low pressure point

7059.46 --> 7066.01
continue on up until the top now you

7063.03 --> 7068.349999999999
demonstrate that you demonstrate that

7066.01 --> 7072.25
right now show it to me show any

7068.35 --> 7076.900000000001
reference to that anything it doesn't

7072.25 --> 7079.15
exist you know why because gas of all

7076.9 --> 7080.32
types no matter how heavy or light or

7079.15 --> 7082.48
whatever

7080.32 --> 7085.03
it's gonna spread out within the

7082.48 --> 7088.239
entirety of the container and then

7085.03 --> 7091.87
afterwards a gradient sets in in a

7088.239 --> 7094.33
specific fashion bound specifically to

7091.87 --> 7096.82
the entire volume of the container

7094.33 --> 7100.2699999999995
finding an average in between and it

7096.82 --> 7106.0599999999995
never ever becomes an asymptote

7100.27 --> 7113.7300000000005
never never unless you could demonstrate

7106.06 --> 7113.7300000000005
that to me in any way in any setup so

7116.1 --> 7119.409000000001
[Music]

7120.36 --> 7129.07
know your badge piece of [ __ ] get out of

7124.42 --> 7131.5
here I don't know who you are literally

7129.07 --> 7134.5599999999995
I don't know that name I don't care

7131.5 --> 7136.12
you're freakin troll head I don't give a

7134.56 --> 7139.84
[ __ ] about what you're saying you're

7136.12 --> 7142.2699999999995
just being nasty and I'm talking to all

7139.84 --> 7150.31
the ballers here not just any freaking

7142.27 --> 7152.370000000001
troll so yeah I don't want claims I

7150.31 --> 7155.620000000001
don't want to claim starry sick dust

7152.37 --> 7157.87
demonstrate that a gas pressure gradient

7155.62 --> 7161.71
in any setup it doesn't even have to

7157.87 --> 7164.11
stick to a freaking ball okay that the

7161.71 --> 7166.9
gradient can be exactly like I

7164.11 --> 7169.36
demonstrated you hurt me you hurt me I

7166.9 --> 7171.73
explained it three or four times now

7169.36 --> 7174.25
that is what I want to hear that is what

7171.73 --> 7176.349999999999
I want to see no more claims I don't

7174.25 --> 7179.469
want to hear about your claims of what

7176.35 --> 7182.89
it is I want to see a demonstration that

7179.469 --> 7185.11
a gas pressure gradient can be like an

7182.89 --> 7188.530000000001
asymptote because I'm pretty damn sure

7185.11 --> 7191.739
it can't now go ahead and find that

7188.53 --> 7195.28
demonstration to prove you're [ __ ]

7191.739 --> 7199.0
religion that makes no damn sense thank
