112.079 --> 115.83999999999999
this night that i'm aware of

but yeah

121.28 --> 124.32000000000001
it's a bit cloudy

125.04 --> 129.92000000000002
it's a little garden work being done out

127.36 --> 132.239
there that i can hear weed whackers and

129.92 --> 132.23899999999998
all that

133.76 --> 136.0
right

136.93 --> 141.87900000000002
[Music]

138.4 --> 141.87900000000002
oh god

145.76 --> 151.28
i got my camera on standby

148.319 --> 152.72
because it's very

151.28 --> 155.72
buggy

152.72 --> 155.72
right

158.16 --> 164.32999999999998
so it's monday the 23rd of may

162.64 --> 167.04
2022

164.33 --> 168.4
[Music]

167.04 --> 171.84
uh

168.4 --> 171.84
let's check the temperature

174.16 --> 179.599
21

175.76 --> 179.599
okay it's 21 degrees celsius

179.76 --> 185.84
so it's yeah it's still kind of nice

183.04 --> 185.84
i thought so

187.2 --> 189.51899999999998
right

192.08 --> 196.519
now what is in chat just yet

200.319 --> 204.0
maybe

201.92 --> 206.95899999999997
my following isn't used to me actually

204.0 --> 206.959
starting on time

208.08 --> 213.08
or they had a very long sunday evening

220.4 --> 223.12
right

221.44 --> 225.35999999999999
anyway

223.12 --> 228.799
yesterday's show was really good very

225.36 --> 231.12
happy with it very steady

228.799 --> 231.12
and

231.76 --> 234.0
yeah

237.439 --> 242.0
had some real good dinner this time i'm

239.76 --> 244.0
still kind of filled up from it but i

242.0 --> 246.56
just really needed a proper

244.0 --> 248.159
dinner elaborate

246.56 --> 249.92000000000002
and was nice

248.159 --> 251.519
and

249.92 --> 255.439
also nathan

251.519 --> 258.639
the 1980 had like a marathon thing going

255.439 --> 261.28
it's set 24 7 though it didn't actually

258.639 --> 264.08
get to that don't know if it's going to

261.28 --> 265.919
be a multi-parter

264.08 --> 268.4
but yeah nathan had a whole bunch of

265.919 --> 271.44
different shows good shows

268.4 --> 271.44
lined up in a row

272.479 --> 276.88
and that was very entertaining yesterday

274.88 --> 280.199
so i did actually sit through the live

276.88 --> 280.199
chat there

295.12 --> 299.6
oh yeah quantum of conscious had a

297.199 --> 303.039
really interesting video

299.6 --> 303.03900000000004
on free voice dot io

306.479 --> 311.36
and the rest of the time it pretty much

308.72 --> 314.32000000000005
was just watching like seven again

311.36 --> 318.24
i'm now finally into the orac phase of

314.32 --> 318.24
the show and wow that's

319.759 --> 322.24
it was

321.199 --> 324.56
i

322.24 --> 326.96000000000004
downplayed it in my mind like it's

324.56 --> 329.68
pretty mind-blowing what they did with

326.96 --> 332.0
that thing

329.68 --> 333.759
and some of it is even like you really

332.0 --> 337.28
have to pay sharp attention in what's

333.759 --> 339.52000000000004
going on or it's just super confusing

337.28 --> 342.0
and i even remember being so confused

339.52 --> 344.15999999999997
about it nagging my brother who was also

342.0 --> 347.12
watching it seven years older than me

344.16 --> 350.56
about it at the time like what how is

347.12 --> 352.32
that he's like yeah just pay attention

350.56 --> 354.0
to what they're saying they do actually

352.32 --> 356.0
say they just say it once they don't

354.0 --> 357.84
keep on repeating it to your face

356.0 --> 360.0
because they don't

357.84 --> 362.96
assume you're stupid they assume you're

360.0 --> 365.36
gonna pay very sharp attention

362.96 --> 367.59999999999997
and now i am

365.36 --> 369.6
what is it like more than

367.6 --> 370.72
25 years later

369.6 --> 373.03900000000004
and

370.72 --> 375.52000000000004
it is really interesting what they do

373.039 --> 376.96
with orac

375.52 --> 379.28
like

376.96 --> 381.84
gonna keep on watching and it's a very

379.28 --> 384.55999999999995
fascinating concept like

381.84 --> 387.59999999999997
really fascinating even makes me think

384.56 --> 390.96
like what do i do right i've called

387.6 --> 394.68
myself an oracle on occasion

390.96 --> 394.68
it's like huh

394.96 --> 398.96
like in a way what orec does and even

397.199 --> 403.199
how he talks about it sounds very

398.96 --> 403.19899999999996
familiar to me that's kind of weird

404.319 --> 410.319
anyway apjc net first in chat finally

407.919 --> 410.31899999999996
somebody

414.24 --> 418.479
oracle's awesome ultimate ai

416.72 --> 420.8
yes

418.479 --> 423.599
but it was so much that he's even like

420.8 --> 425.039
meta explaining about how he just

423.599 --> 427.599
derives

425.039 --> 430.4
what must be true

427.599 --> 432.8
based on all information and like

430.4 --> 434.96
perfect fractal calculation of the

432.8 --> 439.599
potentials

434.96 --> 443.35999999999996
oh because that's kind of what i do

439.599 --> 445.52
except i'm a human being

443.36 --> 445.52000000000004
and

445.68 --> 455.039
i'm still kind of stunned by the concept

449.199 --> 458.88
like did i use oreck as an inspiration

455.039 --> 458.88
some way like what

460.72 --> 464.68
anyway hey borders boy

465.36 --> 469.84000000000003
have you ever considered the timer

467.36 --> 471.68
function class i don't know borders but

469.84 --> 473.75899999999996
i don't know how to turn it on i've

471.68 --> 475.12
tried

473.759 --> 477.199
like in

475.12 --> 479.68
youtube

477.199 --> 482.08000000000004
go live

479.68 --> 482.08
hold on

484.16 --> 490.24
i can't seem to find the function as in

486.879 --> 490.24
like re-announce

491.36 --> 494.47900000000004
it's just not in there

496.72 --> 500.47900000000004
maybe

498.0 --> 502.8
that's already changed i mean the

500.479 --> 505.44
the layout of that all does kind of

502.8 --> 507.599
change over time they do update so i'll

505.44 --> 509.52
i'll check it again but i haven't gotten

507.599 --> 511.84
it to work

509.52 --> 513.12
so that the chat is open before the show

511.84 --> 515.279
starts

513.12 --> 517.44
unfortunately

515.279 --> 518.8
hey tony whitcomb good to see you drop

517.44 --> 521.839
the dvd

518.8 --> 521.8389999999999
to usb

521.919 --> 526.1999999999999
srt5 was missing oh

536.64 --> 539.68
i'm messing it up

545.6 --> 552.0
that's a real tough one

548.88 --> 555.04
it seems like you basically use the the

552.0 --> 557.76
video format

555.04 --> 559.279
to basically create a single file that

557.76 --> 561.2
you can play from

559.279 --> 562.959
and then it doesn't automatically give

561.2 --> 564.72
you like the translator functions to

562.959 --> 567.1999999999999
that you have to then separately add

564.72 --> 567.2
that on

569.44 --> 574.1600000000001
and yeah

571.36 --> 576.64
if you can't do that then

574.16 --> 579.36
i yeah without subtitles still going to

576.64 --> 582.399
be fine i mean when it's going to be

579.36 --> 585.2
non-english spoken i take it that that

582.399 --> 589.12
will actually put english subtitles like

585.2 --> 590.9590000000001
within the video itself

589.12 --> 593.519
so i wouldn't mind too much if there

590.959 --> 595.5999999999999
wasn't any translation to it

593.519 --> 597.279
but otherwise if you can't get it to

595.6 --> 600.5600000000001
work then just

597.279 --> 604.56
make it into a raw image like an image

600.56 --> 607.279
of the dvd that i could potentially burn

604.56 --> 609.5189999999999
right it's a bigger file but you'll get

607.279 --> 612.399
all the other the extra functions in

609.519 --> 613.68
there too including subtitles if you do

612.399 --> 617.519
it like that

613.68 --> 619.04
right so just make it into a disk image

617.519 --> 622.48
instead

619.04 --> 622.48
use narrow dvd right

623.6 --> 627.12
all right

625.12 --> 629.2
yeah if you do if you turn it into a

627.12 --> 633.279
singular file then

629.2 --> 635.12
you won't get the translator functions

633.279 --> 637.8389999999999
unless they're like inherent to the

635.12 --> 639.76
video footage them itself

637.839 --> 641.44
sorry

639.76 --> 644.0
uh anyway

641.44 --> 647.2
nicole zach

644.0 --> 649.12
you'll see media player then you select

647.2 --> 651.0400000000001
yeah george that's all really cute but

649.12 --> 653.36
the language files have to actually be

651.04 --> 653.36
in there

659.279 --> 662.48
an iso that's right

664.399 --> 667.6
that could work anyway

668.88 --> 674.0
do you think english deserves to be so

670.959 --> 676.7199999999999
widespread in the world yeah

674.0 --> 676.72
absolutely

687.519 --> 692.9590000000001
most players don't yeah but i don't i'm

689.92 --> 696.4799999999999
not gonna actually burn it into a dvd to

692.959 --> 701.56
use in a dvd player

696.48 --> 701.5600000000001
i just need the eso file then i can just

702.88 --> 706.48
watch that

704.56 --> 709.1199999999999
like putting your dvd

706.48 --> 711.04
digitized dvd into

709.12 --> 712.48
into a player

711.04 --> 715.48
works just fine

712.48 --> 715.48
anyway

719.68 --> 723.68
right so i had a really interesting

722.32 --> 726.24
bump into

723.68 --> 730.3199999999999
my new neighbor

726.24 --> 734.399
like an hour before i started the show

730.32 --> 736.9590000000001
and like yeah kind of had a conversation

734.399 --> 739.04
she heard me out about what i did

736.959 --> 741.1199999999999
tried to postpone talking about flat

739.04 --> 744.56
earth

741.12 --> 746.399
but i did eventually mention it

744.56 --> 749.1999999999999
at the end after i basically laid down

746.399 --> 752.24
yeah i'm into physics and

749.2 --> 753.9200000000001
history and psychology like to lay down

752.24 --> 756.0
like yeah

753.92 --> 758.3199999999999
yeah before i start mentioning flat

756.0 --> 760.16
earth i'd like you to know that i am

758.32 --> 763.279
very capable

760.16 --> 763.279
very well studied

763.519 --> 768.5600000000001
and then i did drop it and she was

766.8 --> 771.519
like a normie

768.56 --> 774.56
so she'd ask the typical army questions

771.519 --> 776.5600000000001
just some in detail things

774.56 --> 780.8
but i think she's heard about coriolis

776.56 --> 780.8
effect and i explained what it was

781.68 --> 785.76
and i was able to do that very well even

783.68 --> 787.5999999999999
though it was all in dutch had a bit of

785.76 --> 789.68
trouble like finding like oh wait how do

787.6 --> 791.279
you actually say that in dutch but i

789.68 --> 793.1999999999999
figured it out

791.279 --> 795.92
explained it

793.2 --> 796.639
and then and yeah she ended up like oh

795.92 --> 799.36
but

796.639 --> 801.36
why would they do it then

799.36 --> 803.279
i still remember that like

801.36 --> 805.6
you'd ask me that like four or five

803.279 --> 808.079
years ago i wouldn't know now i just

805.6 --> 811.519
immediately know

808.079 --> 814.6389999999999
it is because of money a huge amount of

811.519 --> 816.88
money and it's because of mind control

814.639 --> 818.639
and it's intricately linked

816.88 --> 821.76
those that are under the mind control

818.639 --> 823.36
will see it as prestige to basically add

821.76 --> 826.56
to it

823.36 --> 829.12
so rich people will very gladly give

826.56 --> 832.0
giant piles of money away to it

829.12 --> 832.0
for prestige

832.24 --> 836.0790000000001
and that's part of the setup as to why

834.639 --> 838.0790000000001
it is maintained

836.079 --> 840.88
for money

838.079 --> 840.88
mind control

841.04 --> 844.399
and yeah i got that across

845.04 --> 850.8
as she herself was apparently a

847.199 --> 853.4399999999999
filmmaker a documentary filmmaker

850.8 --> 855.12
in the social sector sector basically

853.44 --> 857.839
about people

855.12 --> 860.079
so yeah that was very interesting i

857.839 --> 861.36
wonder if she did ask me for the channel

860.079 --> 862.88
i don't know if he actually is going to

861.36 --> 864.24
find it underneath all the troll

862.88 --> 866.079
nonsense

864.24 --> 869.44
or if he even

866.079 --> 869.4399999999999
really wanted to in the end

869.6 --> 874.24
but yeah she might be watching so hello

879.76 --> 883.8
but yeah interesting person

884.88 --> 887.12
uh

891.76 --> 896.76
hey iron26 good to see you

909.08 --> 913.249
[Music]

922.72 --> 927.839
right so yeah that's my

925.199 --> 927.8389999999999
summary

928.56 --> 932.4399999999999
went through it very quickly

951.36 --> 955.04
all right by the way also

953.44 --> 958.48
a bit of a bummer

955.04 --> 959.8389999999999
like in the middle of the orac saga

958.48 --> 962.9590000000001
like

959.839 --> 965.36
space commando travis

962.959 --> 967.1199999999999
switches character

965.36 --> 969.279
and that's i remember it now it's like

967.12 --> 971.6
oh god no

969.279 --> 974.24
like the old space commander travis is

971.6 --> 976.8000000000001
like really smart like you can he's an

974.24 --> 979.759
actual smart person

976.8 --> 979.7589999999999
and he's kind of like

980.079 --> 985.7589999999999
it's just interesting but this new guy

982.48 --> 987.6800000000001
is more like a dumb sidekick

985.759 --> 991.36
thug type

987.68 --> 993.3599999999999
really annoying and useless

991.36 --> 997.32
and it's like wow they certainly

993.36 --> 997.32
downgraded that character

998.0 --> 1003.6
i mean yeah it's like another actor

1001.839 --> 1005.519
so that was a bit of a bummer

1003.6 --> 1007.519
remembering that

1005.519 --> 1011.839
i don't even know why why the other

1007.519 --> 1011.839
actor just quit like that

1012.639 --> 1016.8
yeah exactly travis is brilliant that

1014.88 --> 1020.36
replacement isn't

1016.8 --> 1020.3599999999999
is no good

1025.199 --> 1029.679
i mean

1026.319 --> 1031.52
just imagine like the old travis

1029.679 --> 1033.679
getting a grip

1031.52 --> 1035.679
on orac

1033.679 --> 1038.24
like that would be

1035.679 --> 1041.8390000000002
like you would feel like how potentially

1038.24 --> 1044.64
dangerous that could get right

1041.839 --> 1048.1599999999999
because trappers might then parallel

1044.64 --> 1050.3200000000002
construct a secret plan to basically

1048.16 --> 1051.039
become

1050.32 --> 1054.0
like

1051.039 --> 1057.12
use orak for his own thing

1054.0 --> 1060.0
but yeah with the new travis that like

1057.12 --> 1063.4399999999998
he doesn't even yeah that makes no sense

1060.0 --> 1063.44
he wouldn't know what to do with it

1065.44 --> 1067.8400000000001
anyway

1074.32 --> 1080.28
yeah

1075.52 --> 1080.28
which show is this blake seven

1088.08 --> 1091.76
yeah tony whitcomb i know

1093.6 --> 1098.3999999999999
i don't even want to know it like it

1095.6 --> 1098.3999999999999
makes me sick

1102.559 --> 1106.84
a little bit of fresh air actually

1133.76 --> 1137.76
yeah i don't want to get too much in

1135.44 --> 1139.52
depth of that tony witka like it

1137.76 --> 1143.36
literally makes me sick it makes me

1139.52 --> 1143.36
nauseated talking about all that

1144.799 --> 1153.12
it's all so gross

1148.08 --> 1153.12
and so nasty and like derailing

1156.96 --> 1162.96
but yeah people are noticing it

1160.799 --> 1162.96
so

1163.36 --> 1168.6399999999999
i trust that like me not directly

1166.72 --> 1170.48
engaging with that too much that it's

1168.64 --> 1173.039
still going to work out because i do

1170.48 --> 1175.039
notice that like most people are really

1173.039 --> 1176.72
catching on to it

1175.039 --> 1178.8799999999999
including on on lower levels of

1176.72 --> 1181.919
consciousness

1178.88 --> 1184.48
like you you would have to

1181.919 --> 1184.48
and they do

1185.76 --> 1190.039
enough people that is

1211.12 --> 1214.12
right

1245.52 --> 1248.52
um

1248.88 --> 1253.679
oh yeah i also watched owen benjamin who

1251.6 --> 1257.12
who apparently now just does live

1253.679 --> 1257.1200000000001
streams even in the weekend

1260.72 --> 1263.84
and that was interesting

1265.36 --> 1268.24
as usual

1273.2 --> 1277.6000000000001
yeah there was a sunday stream too i

1274.799 --> 1281.0
haven't actually watched that yet

1277.6 --> 1281.0
but i will

1292.27 --> 1295.46
[Music]

1296.559 --> 1300.3999999999999
no borders boy that's not weird

1301.36 --> 1307.01
and it's

1303.039 --> 1310.279
very unlikely to be a coincidence

1307.01 --> 1310.279
[Music]

1313.41 --> 1322.189
[Music]

1325.039 --> 1328.799
right but yeah i don't think

1331.2 --> 1335.76
noticing

1332.559 --> 1337.9189999999999
me and elijah having a conflict lately

1335.76 --> 1342.08
well no

1337.919 --> 1343.679
not really iron 26 i mean we did

1342.08 --> 1344.559
a bit ago

1343.679 --> 1345.44
but

1344.559 --> 1347.84
that's

1345.44 --> 1349.2
i already kind of know why that is and

1347.84 --> 1351.52
it's private

1349.2 --> 1353.1200000000001
right and i'm not gonna

1351.52 --> 1354.72
throw out

1353.12 --> 1356.32
confidential

1354.72 --> 1358.24
things

1356.32 --> 1359.36
so

1358.24 --> 1362.159
like

1359.36 --> 1363.52
only friday he was actually really

1362.159 --> 1367.2
backing me up

1363.52 --> 1369.52
and we had a really good conversation so

1367.2 --> 1370.88
it's just sometimes elijah is in a

1369.52 --> 1373.039
certain mood

1370.88 --> 1375.1200000000001
and then he kind of like slows down and

1373.039 --> 1380.08
it pisses me off

1375.12 --> 1380.08
and then i kind of just try to force

1380.32 --> 1384.3999999999999
get rolling again and then he gets all

1382.559 --> 1385.9189999999999
annoyed by it i really don't like it

1384.4 --> 1388.4
when he's like that but

1385.919 --> 1391.2800000000002
yeah he's not always like that

1388.4 --> 1392.159
and i kind of know why

1391.28 --> 1394.559
right

1392.159 --> 1396.5590000000002
and i trust that it's going to like grow

1394.559 --> 1398.799
less over time

1396.559 --> 1398.799
so

1398.96 --> 1405.3600000000001
yeah look i run into the friction with

1403.28 --> 1407.76
some of the panel members in the

1405.36 --> 1409.6789999999999
periodic basics right pretty much

1407.76 --> 1412.24
happens like every month

1409.679 --> 1416.159
something happens whether it's like 10th

1412.24 --> 1418.4
man or like brian

1416.159 --> 1418.4
or

1418.72 --> 1423.679
elijah

1420.96 --> 1424.64
or neil gets all riled up and crazy

1423.679 --> 1426.159
again

1424.64 --> 1431.72
right so

1426.159 --> 1431.72
everybody has their moments including me

1432.88 --> 1439.44
we're all characters and we've all got

1436.0 --> 1441.039
moments where we're just like less

1439.44 --> 1444.0800000000002
dynamic

1441.039 --> 1445.679
less sensible

1444.08 --> 1449.1399999999999
happens

1445.679 --> 1451.6000000000001
ups and downs swings of the pendulum

1449.14 --> 1453.8400000000001
[Music]

1451.6 --> 1456.84
keeps it interesting anyway yeah

1453.84 --> 1456.84
arguably

1463.039 --> 1466.24
hello cleverocus

1469.039 --> 1474.559
these leaders in the circus are world

1471.36 --> 1476.32
economic forum yeah

1474.559 --> 1480.3999999999999
yeah they are

1476.32 --> 1480.3999999999999
it's the special boy club right

1481.12 --> 1485.9599999999998
that's what it is it's the special boy

1482.96 --> 1485.96
club

1489.52 --> 1493.24
a matthew hall

1510.08 --> 1513.6
right any reflections on things that i

1512.159 --> 1516.3200000000002
mentioned yesterday i thought i had a

1513.6 --> 1518.0
really good idea

1516.32 --> 1520.96
about

1518.0 --> 1520.96
the reversed

1521.2 --> 1525.679
north korean theater

1524.159 --> 1527.8400000000001
situation

1525.679 --> 1531.44
any reflections on that

1527.84 --> 1533.6
how like world economic forum like these

1531.44 --> 1537.279
supposed leaders and their cons

1533.6 --> 1540.0
conspiracy open conspiracy really

1537.279 --> 1542.0
i mean it is open they just say what

1540.0 --> 1543.6
they're doing

1542.0 --> 1544.4
yeah

1543.6 --> 1547.9189999999999
that

1544.4 --> 1547.919
it may literally be

1548.32 --> 1554.84
like in like they've become infeasible

1552.08 --> 1558.72
even though in control

1554.84 --> 1559.9189999999999
so from like bottom up

1558.72 --> 1561.679
they're like

1559.919 --> 1564.0
attempt like the people that are

1561.679 --> 1567.6000000000001
actually part of it but not in control

1564.0 --> 1570.48
are trying to maybe partially contain it

1567.6 --> 1574.1589999999999
by creating an act

1570.48 --> 1577.2
to like satisfy the nobility so you

1574.159 --> 1579.679
could compare it to like uh outsiders

1577.2 --> 1582.159
going to north korea being shown at just

1579.679 --> 1585.039
a theater city and all that nothing is

1582.159 --> 1587.679
about it's actually real or if you could

1585.039 --> 1590.64
compare it to like uh

1587.679 --> 1590.64
what's it called again

1591.2 --> 1593.44
like

1597.12 --> 1602.08
like the the chinese emperor system

1599.919 --> 1603.919
where the emperor is basically only

1602.08 --> 1606.48
informed about what

1603.919 --> 1609.679
his direct guard tells him

1606.48 --> 1610.64
so it's kept in a delusion almost

1609.679 --> 1612.72
right

1610.64 --> 1616.5590000000002
it it just reminded me about that and

1612.72 --> 1616.559
i'd really like to hear your like

1618.64 --> 1623.3600000000001
thoughts

1620.24 --> 1625.36
and considerations about that that that

1623.36 --> 1628.799
might be the case here with these world

1625.36 --> 1631.6789999999999
economic forum conspirators

1628.799 --> 1632.72
that they might be partially suspended

1631.679 --> 1635.039
in

1632.72 --> 1638.64
a theatrical

1635.039 --> 1641.12
dream that is being built for them

1638.64 --> 1644.72
to like help emphasize in their mind

1641.12 --> 1647.6789999999999
that it's all real when it is

1644.72 --> 1650.0
not truly complete like it's already

1647.679 --> 1652.64
buckling in ways like it it could have

1650.0 --> 1655.12
only ever really worked if everybody

1652.64 --> 1657.2
would have been oh yes we're just gonna

1655.12 --> 1659.84
try and delete trust the leadership

1657.2 --> 1663.039
completely blind and do whatever you say

1659.84 --> 1665.76
right then there wouldn't be any theater

1663.039 --> 1665.76
necessary

1666.399 --> 1672.399
they're like being protected from their

1668.88 --> 1674.0
own failure of influence

1672.399 --> 1676.32
even though they're still in the middle

1674.0 --> 1679.6
of a power play

1676.32 --> 1683.2
right power is more corporate

1679.6 --> 1684.7199999999998
financial the mind control part is

1683.2 --> 1687.3600000000001
faltering

1684.72 --> 1690.0
so a theater is being erected to

1687.36 --> 1690.0
basically

1693.36 --> 1698.8799999999999
keep them on

1694.84 --> 1701.6
track so they don't like panic like wait

1698.88 --> 1702.7990000000002
this is not really under control we have

1701.6 --> 1705.1999999999998
to like

1702.799 --> 1707.36
up our game or whatever do something

1705.2 --> 1711.1200000000001
dramatic

1707.36 --> 1713.9189999999999
so love to hear your thoughts about that

1711.12 --> 1713.9189999999999
hello elishi

1715.679 --> 1720.0800000000002
what

1716.64 --> 1720.0800000000002
a dream about me oh dear

1720.48 --> 1724.679
or the boot camp arrangement

1729.679 --> 1733.44
that sounds pretty cool matthew hall

1733.52 --> 1737.039
i mean

1734.64 --> 1740.5590000000002
that kind of reminds me of the amsterdam

1737.039 --> 1743.52
conference in 2019

1740.559 --> 1745.84
it was basically just

1743.52 --> 1748.48
on a camping ground

1745.84 --> 1750.48
drinking beers and smoking joints of

1748.48 --> 1753.1200000000001
course we're in amsterdam

1750.48 --> 1756.48
around a campfire

1753.12 --> 1757.6789999999999
and like going into the city

1756.48 --> 1759.279
like

1757.679 --> 1762.3200000000002
just going around

1759.279 --> 1764.88
visiting cafes and all that and

1762.32 --> 1767.84
also of course the presentations during

1764.88 --> 1767.8400000000001
the daytime yeah

1768.48 --> 1771.279
it was great

1772.0 --> 1777.36
and hey i'd love to do it again but yeah

1774.08 --> 1780.1589999999999
it was blatantly like oh oh our win is

1777.36 --> 1783.6
is going out there oh oh okay let's

1780.159 --> 1786.64
that's not good so like the month after

1783.6 --> 1787.9189999999999
the entire world closed down that's what

1786.64 --> 1791.039
happens

1787.919 --> 1794.3200000000002
when arwyn goes to a meeting one time

1791.039 --> 1798.52
the entire world closed down and like

1794.32 --> 1798.52
millions of people died

1799.2 --> 1802.39
[Applause]

1808.799 --> 1814.9189999999999
i mean i know it's just correlatory but

1811.44 --> 1814.919
damn man

1816.55 --> 1820.849
[Music]

1823.76 --> 1827.52
it was still worth it though it was

1825.36 --> 1831.6
definitely worth it to meet adam meekin

1827.52 --> 1831.6
face to face first and foremost

1832.72 --> 1836.72
if i hadn't then i might not truly trust

1835.6 --> 1839.6789999999999
him now

1836.72 --> 1842.3990000000001
he's a very complicated guy

1839.679 --> 1844.88
there's a lot of subtleties that i was

1842.399 --> 1847.279
able to pick up on

1844.88 --> 1848.0
because well basically sharing a cabin

1847.279 --> 1850.399
and

1848.0 --> 1853.44
talking a lot face to face

1850.399 --> 1855.03
so i get more sensory input

1853.44 --> 1856.96
anyway

1855.03 --> 1860.72
[Music]

1856.96 --> 1863.72
brazil is against the who treaty good on

1860.72 --> 1863.72
them

1864.64 --> 1869.519
and i bet there's others

1866.64 --> 1871.679
right that like uh the hungarian is not

1869.519 --> 1874.88
gonna go along with it

1871.679 --> 1877.44
and uh

1874.88 --> 1881.1200000000001
some of the others

1877.44 --> 1885.1200000000001
would you not go on live with dell

1881.12 --> 1886.2399999999998
i've already gone on with live with dell

1885.12 --> 1889.1999999999998
like

1886.24 --> 1889.2
five years ago

1890.64 --> 1894.9
but sure i might go on live with him

1894.08 --> 1897.9489999999998
again

1894.9 --> 1897.949
[Music]

1899.2 --> 1902.64
i mean if i feel like it

1903.12 --> 1905.6789999999999
i mean i don't know if there's really

1904.88 --> 1907.679
like

1905.679 --> 1909.919
very elaborate discussions that we could

1907.679 --> 1911.76
even have i'm pretty sure dell really

1909.919 --> 1914.7990000000002
knows where i'm at

1911.76 --> 1914.799
mentally and all that

1916.96 --> 1919.96
and

1920.08 --> 1925.6
i think i i i'd get bill as well so but

1923.36 --> 1928.24
yeah who knows like if he wants to talk

1925.6 --> 1928.24
to me sure

1930.559 --> 1935.84
i think you have to then like send him

1932.399 --> 1935.84
an email or something right

1968.32 --> 1971.039
hey crockett

1975.279 --> 1979.2
hey uncool ben

1977.519 --> 1981.76
thanks for the 10 pound super chat

1979.2 --> 1981.76
donation

1985.919 --> 1990.64
i mean

1987.039 --> 1992.0
dude that's such a hilarious name

1990.64 --> 1994.96
with that

1992.0 --> 1998.32
chilled out sunglasses photo on there

1994.96 --> 2002.1200000000001
it's i don't know it's funny

1998.32 --> 2002.12
thanks for the super chat

2007.76 --> 2014.64
majority roman catholic oh yeah matthew

2011.039 --> 2014.64
it's all very complicated

2017.039 --> 2023.6
solve all very very complicated like

2020.559 --> 2026.08
that it's like oh this group is doing

2023.6 --> 2028.399
all that side really great

2026.08 --> 2030.6399999999999
but on the other side they're still tied

2028.399 --> 2034.559
in with the group that's obviously

2030.64 --> 2036.7990000000002
like trying to be part of the problem

2034.559 --> 2036.799
but

2039.679 --> 2045.919
like they might be

2041.679 --> 2048.0
sort of like catholic separatists i do

2045.919 --> 2051.599
have you ever thought that maybe there

2048.0 --> 2054.8
could be a moment where literally

2051.599 --> 2056.8
brazil might basically create their own

2054.8 --> 2059.599
catholic

2056.8 --> 2061.44
uh christianity branch

2059.599 --> 2063.04
where they're going to like get their

2061.44 --> 2065.44
own pope

2063.04 --> 2068.32
it might happen right i mean the

2065.44 --> 2070.639
circumstances might be there

2068.32 --> 2072.2400000000002
or may they might go through some kind

2070.639 --> 2075.2400000000002
of like national religious

2072.24 --> 2075.24
transformation

2086.72 --> 2091.4399999999996
it certainly seems to be

2088.72 --> 2093.919
ready for that there's a lot of energy

2091.44 --> 2097.76
in brazil

2093.919 --> 2097.7599999999998
and they've done a lot of good things

2101.2 --> 2104.2
ugh

2130.56 --> 2132.7999999999997
um

2135.839 --> 2140.24
right exactly matthew hall

2138.24 --> 2143.68
it did happen before

2140.24 --> 2145.7599999999998
i mean protestantism happened

2143.68 --> 2148.7999999999997
in north

2145.76 --> 2148.8
northwest europe

2150.0 --> 2152.56
and

2151.44 --> 2153.839
yeah

2152.56 --> 2156.32
maybe that

2153.839 --> 2160.32
they're gonna have their own so but not

2156.32 --> 2160.32
like protestantism it's more like

2160.8 --> 2163.6800000000003
a further

2162.56 --> 2166.72
in

2163.68 --> 2169.2799999999997
off-branch of catholicism right and such

2166.72 --> 2171.9199999999996
developments can sometimes completely

2169.28 --> 2173.44
transform the entire world religious

2171.92 --> 2174.4
landscape

2173.44 --> 2177.76
because

2174.4 --> 2180.079
they're very close but they have strong

2177.76 --> 2181.599
detail alterations and it becomes like

2180.079 --> 2184.4
really popular

2181.599 --> 2186.56
than the actual catholic church itself

2184.4 --> 2191.28
and the papers papacy

2186.56 --> 2192.56
might literally just yield to that

2191.28 --> 2194.8
because

2192.56 --> 2195.839
you might have noticed the pattern in

2194.8 --> 2198.1600000000003
how

2195.839 --> 2201.04
the papacy and all that is behaving

2198.16 --> 2203.52
they're always very

2201.04 --> 2204.64
dynamic in a sense in a way that they

2203.52 --> 2206.72
shouldn't be

2204.64 --> 2208.48
adapting to things that they absolutely

2206.72 --> 2211.4399999999996
shouldn't be adapting to

2208.48 --> 2213.68
but that adaptability

2211.44 --> 2216.88
can also be

2213.68 --> 2217.839
towards a new trend within catholicism

2216.88 --> 2221.44
you see

2217.839 --> 2223.599
so who knows what could happen

2221.44 --> 2227.8
i'm keeping my eye on brazil

2223.599 --> 2227.8
what spirit eye that is

2239.31 --> 2242.36
[Music]

2246.32 --> 2249.32
so

2259.92 --> 2262.16
uh

2264.32 --> 2270.44
over 11 million fleurs in brazil right

2271.28 --> 2275.5600000000004
there's a lot of flat earthers there

2287.839 --> 2293.04
yep

2289.92 --> 2296.7200000000003
yeah matthew it's just one guy

2293.04 --> 2299.52
and he's like but i'm a sock changer

2296.72 --> 2303.04
like a face changer on the internet

2299.52 --> 2306.0
and i'm being nice and being nice yeah

2303.04 --> 2309.2799999999997
but you're completely unreliable

2306.0 --> 2309.28
and a face changer

2309.599 --> 2314.079
effectively so i don't care even if

2312.48 --> 2316.2400000000002
you're nice

2314.079 --> 2317.8390000000004
you're not a anchored

2316.24 --> 2319.839
identifiable

2317.839 --> 2322.7999999999997
person on the internet

2319.839 --> 2326.2
so i don't accept you i don't accept

2322.8 --> 2326.2000000000003
face changers

2326.48 --> 2329.599
as i'm gonna call them

2330.24 --> 2337.4399999999996
just have a normal name and keep it

2336.32 --> 2338.839
then

2337.44 --> 2340.4
i can look it

2338.839 --> 2342.56
up

2340.4 --> 2345.2000000000003
my moderator function and see oh wait

2342.56 --> 2347.68
this is actually a person that's had an

2345.2 --> 2350.48
account for quite a while maybe even

2347.68 --> 2351.9199999999996
made some videos that's an actual person

2350.48 --> 2354.72
and not some

2351.92 --> 2355.839
other sock account that's just sneaking

2354.72 --> 2358.16
in

2355.839 --> 2359.7599999999998
to try and create a ruckus at some point

2358.16 --> 2361.839
and ruin my show

2359.76 --> 2362.7200000000003
yeah

2361.839 --> 2365.68
i mean

2362.72 --> 2366.9599999999996
i've been dealing with these people that

2365.68 --> 2367.68
do that

2366.96 --> 2370.7200000000003
for

2367.68 --> 2370.72
five years now

2371.44 --> 2375.8
i'm not going to be subtle about it

2379.25 --> 2383.039
[Music]

2386.62 --> 2390.3199999999997
[Music]

2389.28 --> 2392.8
right

2390.32 --> 2396.119
you don't enter my workshop

2392.8 --> 2396.119
in disguise

2397.44 --> 2400.2400000000002
it's very simple

2403.76 --> 2409.6800000000003
the normal name account for four years

2406.24 --> 2412.7999999999997
then they took me down oh that sucks

2409.68 --> 2415.2799999999997
right clap ruckus but i recognize you i

2412.8 --> 2417.52
recognize your name and the picture

2415.28 --> 2419.8390000000004
and the way you talk

2417.52 --> 2422.64
and it's all been consistent so i can

2419.839 --> 2425.119
effectively identify you as a cohesive

2422.64 --> 2426.72
singular person

2425.119 --> 2428.88
even though it's not your original name

2426.72 --> 2431.5989999999997
right you don't have to use your own

2428.88 --> 2434.1600000000003
name that's not my demand my name demand

2431.599 --> 2437.44
is that it is

2434.16 --> 2439.7599999999998
something it's not gross it's not making

2437.44 --> 2443.28
fun of me

2439.76 --> 2445.6800000000003
or my associates like nathan oakley

2443.28 --> 2447.119
it's not trolling them in any way

2445.68 --> 2448.96
i mean if you want to make fun of like

2447.119 --> 2451.28
neil degrasse ties and that's all fine

2448.96 --> 2453.359
right then there's some guys that have

2451.28 --> 2454.7200000000003
those names that's all fine if you that

2453.359 --> 2456.88
you want to do that

2454.72 --> 2458.72
but you better live up to that name then

2456.88 --> 2461.2000000000003
right if you're just using it as some

2458.72 --> 2464.48
kind of virtue signal cover

2461.2 --> 2467.7599999999998
to sneak in and then actually act

2464.48 --> 2470.079
like an anti-flat earther troll

2467.76 --> 2472.6400000000003
and i will directly connect that and

2470.079 --> 2474.8
just kick you out

2472.64 --> 2477.2
yeah

2474.8 --> 2478.2400000000002
high standards

2477.2 --> 2481.839
that's

2478.24 --> 2481.839
how it works here

2485.44 --> 2489.04
right but yeah sucks to hear that you

2487.839 --> 2492.0789999999997
had your

2489.04 --> 2495.839
original account just deleted like that

2492.079 --> 2495.8390000000004
you got to be careful these days

2501.599 --> 2504.599
ah

2509.76 --> 2512.76
right

2528.72 --> 2531.72
um

2548.72 --> 2552.48
yes club ruckus and i remember in the

2551.119 --> 2555.44
beginning that you were like kind of

2552.48 --> 2558.4
goofing around but even if you're like

2555.44 --> 2562.8
unknowingly goofing around because you

2558.4 --> 2562.8
you don't see a problem

2563.599 --> 2569.04
i will record that

2566.16 --> 2571.04
as well as part of the natural behavior

2569.04 --> 2573.839
development

2571.04 --> 2575.359
i mean i it's not like i have like a

2573.839 --> 2578.7999999999997
list

2575.359 --> 2581.359
of patients and then i record like i

2578.8 --> 2583.28
notify every person's psychological

2581.359 --> 2585.44
profile but i do it all in my head it

2583.28 --> 2588.8
just it just happens

2585.44 --> 2590.88
it doesn't even use words it's just like

2588.8 --> 2593.8390000000004
a fractal i see

2590.88 --> 2598.1600000000003
it's just like that's

2593.839 --> 2598.16
that's basically how i identify people

2598.4 --> 2602.2400000000002
i don't memorize them

2601.44 --> 2605.119
i

2602.24 --> 2608.9599999999996
recognize the frequency and then have a

2605.119 --> 2610.56
correlating response profile to adapt to

2608.96 --> 2612.8
that frequency

2610.56 --> 2615.2
and it gets more fine-tuned and more

2612.8 --> 2617.44
detailed over time more refined that's

2615.2 --> 2618.48
how i kind of do things

2617.44 --> 2621.04
right

2618.48 --> 2623.44
it sounds weird but your actual identity

2621.04 --> 2626.319
is kind of secondary to your behavioral

2623.44 --> 2629.2000000000003
profile for my identification

2626.319 --> 2631.92
that's also how i am very

2629.2 --> 2633.04
able to identify

2631.92 --> 2635.44
people

2633.04 --> 2637.359
that are face changers i can identify by

2635.44 --> 2639.119
the way they're acting and speaking who

2637.359 --> 2641.52
they are

2639.119 --> 2644.56
and they don't get hung up on like

2641.52 --> 2647.599
typical memorized sort of details to

2644.56 --> 2650.16
distract me from that i just look at the

2647.599 --> 2650.1600000000003
frequency

2650.96 --> 2656.2400000000002
that's how i can even know like wait

2653.839 --> 2659.839
this guy the same picture the same name

2656.24 --> 2659.839
but he's acting very off

2660.24 --> 2665.839
like i just immediately noticed that

2662.72 --> 2665.839
hey aaron armstrong

2666.24 --> 2674.2799999999997
talk about people i have

2669.52 --> 2674.28
profiles on in my head

2679.119 --> 2682.119
anyway

2692.079 --> 2694.6400000000003
okay

2693.04 --> 2697.2799999999997
you don't want to give youtube your

2694.64 --> 2697.2799999999997
phone number

2699.92 --> 2703.079
all right

2704.48 --> 2708.56
it all depends on how anonymous you wish

2707.119 --> 2710.1600000000003
to remain

2708.56 --> 2712.48
to

2710.16 --> 2716.92
to the information gatherers out there i

2712.48 --> 2716.92
mean i am pretty much open

2740.8 --> 2743.44
hello

2744.64 --> 2751.44
new person

2747.359 --> 2751.44
dj one deck host music

2751.839 --> 2757.119
no videos

2753.68 --> 2760.2799999999997
but you do have activity and some subs

2757.119 --> 2760.28
all right

2760.8 --> 2764.4
guess it's because you're not effie

2766.24 --> 2772.839
well not being fe

2769.359 --> 2775.52
is certainly gonna be an influence aaron

2772.839 --> 2776.96
armstrong but there's other people in

2775.52 --> 2779.839
here that are

2776.96 --> 2782.96
not fe as you say

2779.839 --> 2786.4
and they're still very capable of just

2782.96 --> 2787.2
being here without getting banned

2786.4 --> 2789.119
right

2787.2 --> 2791.839
because in the end in my chat it's about

2789.119 --> 2791.839
the behavior

2792.48 --> 2797.359
i'm one deck yeah

2794.96 --> 2797.359
okay

2800.48 --> 2804.079
i don't know what that if that means

2802.48 --> 2808.599
something but

2804.079 --> 2808.599
right that's your name

2836.56 --> 2841.52
yep

2838.079 --> 2841.52
a little bit of flat okay

2841.76 --> 2846.6400000000003
the globe is flat that's kind of weird

2845.28 --> 2849.52
to say that

2846.64 --> 2849.52
you mean the earth

2849.92 --> 2854.88
you don't really care anymore

2852.48 --> 2854.88
okay

2855.68 --> 2858.9199999999996
why not

2864.4 --> 2868.599
why don't you care anymore aaron

2877.44 --> 2881.119
measured flat

2879.68 --> 2884.0789999999997
right

2881.119 --> 2885.2000000000003
well technically it is mechanically true

2884.079 --> 2888.079
though

2885.2 --> 2890.16
i mean the entire globe

2888.079 --> 2891.6800000000003
math

2890.16 --> 2892.96
is based

2891.68 --> 2895.9199999999996
off

2892.96 --> 2897.44
original measured flat plane

2895.92 --> 2899.44
so technically

2897.44 --> 2901.839
it is true

2899.44 --> 2903.359
the globe is measured flat that is

2901.839 --> 2906.88
likely

2903.359 --> 2908.48
the globe that is claimed to be

2906.88 --> 2911.2000000000003
is actually

2908.48 --> 2913.04
derived and created upon flat

2911.2 --> 2915.1189999999997
measurement

2913.04 --> 2917.839
right

2915.119 --> 2917.839
that's true

2924.88 --> 2929.76
it's all a word game now

2927.359 --> 2930.72
who has the burden of proof

2929.76 --> 2934.079
well

2930.72 --> 2937.359
those that make a claim aaron armstrong

2934.079 --> 2939.8390000000004
now some people like nathan

2937.359 --> 2940.96
just really doesn't like making claims

2939.839 --> 2944.16
anymore

2940.96 --> 2944.16
he's all about the

2944.64 --> 2949.04
about the kill he's like a gladiator he

2946.72 --> 2951.359
just doesn't care to make a stand he's

2949.04 --> 2954.0
just like nope just bring on your claims

2951.359 --> 2955.119
i'm gonna chop it down

2954.0 --> 2957.2
or

2955.119 --> 2958.6400000000003
honor it if it is

2957.2 --> 2960.96
backed with proof

2958.64 --> 2962.96
right that's what nathan does i however

2960.96 --> 2964.96
am much more interested in actually

2962.96 --> 2967.2
trying to figure out what is what how

2964.96 --> 2969.44
things work and what could be

2967.2 --> 2972.5589999999997
and to differentiate between what could

2969.44 --> 2975.52
be and what actually is

2972.559 --> 2977.52
so i do like to make claims right and i

2975.52 --> 2978.88
do make claims

2977.52 --> 2979.839
and we claim

2978.88 --> 2981.839
that

2979.839 --> 2983.68
quite certain

2981.839 --> 2986.48
i mean it's not no

2983.68 --> 2987.9199999999996
i mean at this point it is kind of 100 i

2986.48 --> 2989.92
claim

2987.92 --> 2992.96
that the celestial lights are all

2989.92 --> 2995.599
non-local holographic

2992.96 --> 3000.319
and i've uttered the challenge many many

2995.599 --> 3002.6400000000003
times prove me wrong show me this

3000.319 --> 3005.119
perspective approach

3002.64 --> 3007.7599999999998
show the angular size increase as you

3005.119 --> 3008.88
approach any of the celestials right

3007.76 --> 3011.5200000000004
moons

3008.88 --> 3012.7200000000003
the moon is supposedly the closest in

3011.52 --> 3015.839
either

3012.72 --> 3018.64
yeah presuppositional models

3015.839 --> 3020.7999999999997
so then yeah do that do the moon go

3018.64 --> 3023.1189999999997
there see the angular size changes you

3020.8 --> 3025.2000000000003
approach oh wait no that doesn't happen

3023.119 --> 3027.76
yeah surprise surprise

3025.2 --> 3030.96
because they're non-local holograms they

3027.76 --> 3035.96
don't actually exist even as apparitions

3030.96 --> 3035.96
in specific euclidean positions

3049.599 --> 3053.599
nathan says it's measurably and

3051.28 --> 3057.2000000000003
observably flat that's a claim right

3053.599 --> 3058.7200000000003
yeah and that's a claim he came back

3057.2 --> 3060.8799999999997
right those are claims that he is

3058.72 --> 3063.839
willing to back because it's very basic

3060.88 --> 3065.28
it's the geometric orientation of the

3063.839 --> 3068.88
earth's surface

3065.28 --> 3071.8390000000004
and it is measurable

3068.88 --> 3073.359
and observable

3071.839 --> 3075.44
right he's willing to make claims that

3073.359 --> 3079.319
he can directly back

3075.44 --> 3079.319
and that is one of them

3087.04 --> 3091.52
you claim

3089.28 --> 3093.44
that's gross

3091.52 --> 3094.4
you claim he's a troll yeah well he

3093.44 --> 3096.4
admits

3094.4 --> 3099.2000000000003
he is admitted on many occasions that he

3096.4 --> 3099.2000000000003
is a troll

3104.4 --> 3111.1600000000003
don't you know you have to defend that

3106.48 --> 3111.16
claim yeah and i do that all the time

3111.92 --> 3114.079
i do it

3113.28 --> 3116.559
right

3114.079 --> 3118.319
but yeah there is really not much to

3116.559 --> 3120.079
defend

3118.319 --> 3124.16
i mean the only thing that people can

3120.079 --> 3127.2000000000003
throw at me about it naggingly as usual

3124.16 --> 3129.5989999999997
is like oh but you can't reconstruct it

3127.2 --> 3131.4399999999996
why don't you show that how that works

3129.599 --> 3133.92
then make it

3131.44 --> 3135.52
some technology that can do that yeah oh

3133.92 --> 3137.04
thanks like

3135.52 --> 3140.319
i don't know

3137.04 --> 3142.64
i just know there is absolutely no proof

3140.319 --> 3143.92
of the euclidean literal position of any

3142.64 --> 3146.72
of it

3143.92 --> 3148.48
there would if there would be

3146.72 --> 3151.2799999999997
there would be

3148.48 --> 3154.2400000000002
angular size increase as you approach

3151.28 --> 3156.7200000000003
that's nature that's how optics work

3154.24 --> 3160.0
if that's not there

3156.72 --> 3162.72
then it's not an object in a specific

3160.0 --> 3164.88
position because all forms of object

3162.72 --> 3167.52
even if they are ethereal right even if

3164.88 --> 3168.96
they're just a hologram of light that is

3167.52 --> 3171.119
local like

3168.96 --> 3173.76
a bunch of mirrors and glass and light

3171.119 --> 3176.1600000000003
and it there's an apparition it's not a

3173.76 --> 3177.92
physical object but it's still local if

3176.16 --> 3180.0
you go away

3177.92 --> 3181.599
right it does become smaller to you and

3180.0 --> 3184.0
if you approach it becomes bigger to you

3181.599 --> 3186.559
a local hologram right that's as far as

3184.0 --> 3188.4
we can go technology-wise to

3186.559 --> 3192.7200000000003
to emulate it

3188.4 --> 3195.599
what non-local holographics

3192.72 --> 3197.4399999999996
it's a bit over my head i just know

3195.599 --> 3200.4
that's

3197.44 --> 3202.96
what it kind of has to be with complete

3200.4 --> 3205.28
lack of evidence of anything other than

3202.96 --> 3205.28
that

3205.76 --> 3211.44
right so that's my case cases you can't

3208.8 --> 3213.92
prove me wrong

3211.44 --> 3215.76
and i know that's not a scientific claim

3213.92 --> 3217.76
that's not like oh i'm going to write a

3215.76 --> 3221.6800000000003
paper about this go to the university

3217.76 --> 3225.28
and i'll get all famous no because

3221.68 --> 3227.9199999999996
yeah i'm not literally backing

3225.28 --> 3230.6400000000003
i'm not proving it i'm just telling

3227.92 --> 3232.0
everybody look you can't prove this

3230.64 --> 3235.359
wrong

3232.0 --> 3237.28
you can prove to me that it's physical

3235.359 --> 3239.2799999999997
that's my case

3237.28 --> 3242.4
prove to me approach

3239.28 --> 3245.119
there is no evidence for this

3242.4 --> 3245.119
like zero

3246.16 --> 3251.839
right so i'm having an argument

3248.96 --> 3254.64
about it a public argument

3251.839 --> 3254.64
prove me wrong

3255.68 --> 3258.68
right

3290.24 --> 3293.5989999999997
it's impossible to argue with typing

3292.559 --> 3296.2400000000002
arwin

3293.599 --> 3296.2400000000002
what do you mean

3298.96 --> 3303.839
i mean

3300.4 --> 3309.119
not impossible it's just really tough

3303.839 --> 3309.119
because i tend to like process things at

3309.839 --> 3313.68
10 times the average speed that people

3312.72 --> 3315.9199999999996
think

3313.68 --> 3315.9199999999996
like

3316.72 --> 3322.0
like physically speaking actually slows

3319.599 --> 3325.52
me down

3322.0 --> 3328.799
i can type faster than i can speak

3325.52 --> 3332.62
and i can think faster than i can type

3328.799 --> 3335.79
so just how i work

3332.62 --> 3335.79
[Music]

3365.44 --> 3368.44
right

3384.4 --> 3387.44

hey lenox

3517.599 --> 3520.2400000000002

never heard of that

3534.319 --> 3538.079
oh okay i thought it is fine

3539.52 --> 3545.079
are you dutch because your name seems

3542.079 --> 3545.079
dutch

3545.28 --> 3550.0
that's a dutch way of

3547.52 --> 3550.0
spelling

not double dutch

3570.559 --> 3577.52
stop saying that it's not funny

3574.48 --> 3580.319
every time somebody says dutch

3577.52 --> 3582.64
double dodge nobody cares

3580.319 --> 3585.92
double dutch is stupid

3582.64 --> 3589.5989999999997
it's not the like please think back of

3585.92 --> 3591.839
cheese and wooden shoes okay please when

3589.599 --> 3595.119
somebody says dutch think freaking

3591.839 --> 3596.16
wooden shoes and cheese okay

3595.119 --> 3599.28
please

3596.16 --> 3602.16
stop saying freaking double dutch every

3599.28 --> 3606.8390000000004
time somebody brings up dutch please i

3602.16 --> 3606.839
beg of you it's so annoying

3617.86 --> 3621.52
[Music]

3620.4 --> 3624.0

anyway

3624.72 --> 3629.64

3657.76 --> 3662.2400000000002
i know len lenox please forget about it

3660.16 --> 3665.2
it's so annoying just

3662.24 --> 3667.839
please replace it with wooden shoes and

3665.2 --> 3671.839
cheese and windmills or something

3667.839 --> 3673.52
please beg of you stop say i hate dub

3671.839 --> 3677.96
dutch i hate

3673.52 --> 3677.96
every time hearing that

3698.69 --> 3701.849
[Music]

3702.16 --> 3706.319
is that apple juice and what

3709.599 --> 3713.839
you're a lover of most music

3714.64 --> 3719.7599999999998
you mean you like to have noise around

3716.96 --> 3719.76
in the background

3724.72 --> 3728.319
nobody nobody's a lover of most music if

3726.799 --> 3731.52
you're a music lover you're going to

3728.319 --> 3731.52
have specifics

3731.68 --> 3736.0789999999997
and i should know

3733.92 --> 3737.599
i am a music lover and my taste is

3736.079 --> 3740.7200000000003
extremely

3737.599 --> 3744.48
specific and high demanding and there's

3740.72 --> 3747.1189999999997
a lot of music that i find absolutely

3744.48 --> 3747.119
disgusting

3751.839 --> 3758.2
yes uncle ben thanks don't remind

3755.2 --> 3758.2
everybody

3795.839 --> 3799.7599999999998
okay

3797.68 --> 3801.2799999999997
kumafires i've never heard

3799.76 --> 3802.96
any of those

3801.28 --> 3805.2000000000003
it's the first time i've ever heard any

3802.96 --> 3808.359
of those names

3805.2 --> 3808.359
all right

3825.52 --> 3829.28
you're an elitist with underground music

3828.0 --> 3832.72
as

3829.28 --> 3836.48
death metal oh gross okay

3832.72 --> 3840.3999999999996
damn you listen to that [ __ ]

3836.48 --> 3840.4
no water no wonder you like

3840.64 --> 3843.44
like rubber

3843.599 --> 3847.039
take that kind of hammering

3847.28 --> 3851.44
then yeah no [ __ ] you're able to

3849.039 --> 3853.5200000000004
basically let nathan grill you for two

3851.44 --> 3855.52
hours straight damn

3853.52 --> 3859.52
okay that explains some things you

3855.52 --> 3859.52
listening to death metal gumu virus

3860.799 --> 3865.68
also explains how why you're so

3862.799 --> 3868.319
incredibly thick

3865.68 --> 3870.0789999999997
because that [ __ ] numbs you down i know

3868.319 --> 3873.68
from experience

3870.079 --> 3875.599
i was in the metal and gothic scene

3873.68 --> 3877.52
and there were there was also death

3875.599 --> 3879.839
metal here and there and that's usually

3877.52 --> 3882.24
when i leave the room

3879.839 --> 3884.4
because i don't like to be literally

3882.24 --> 3884.3999999999996
like

3884.72 --> 3888.319
right

3885.76 --> 3891.3590000000004
to me that's like

3888.319 --> 3891.359
let me call it again

3892.0 --> 3897.68
it's not like shock therapy but using

3894.559 --> 3897.6800000000003
music instead

3900.319 --> 3905.2
right i'd much prefer more melodic stuff

3903.28 --> 3909.8390000000004
which like black metals more in that

3905.2 --> 3909.839
direction and gothic rock and

3910.72 --> 3915.5989999999997
but yeah i've grown

3912.64 --> 3918.0
kind of out of metal in general

3915.599 --> 3920.88
much more in the direction of like

3918.0 --> 3920.88
heavy electro

3921.039 --> 3926.7200000000003
there's such amazing music that nobody's

3924.079 --> 3930.0
ever heard of nobody will probably ever

3926.72 --> 3932.64
hear of and it's like

3930.0 --> 3932.64
incredible

3934.24 --> 3939.2
i still got like a playlist of music

3936.4 --> 3941.2000000000003
that i was listening like every freaking

3939.2 --> 3942.64
day when i was in a relationship 10

3941.2 --> 3945.5989999999997
years ago

3942.64 --> 3948.4
i actually saw the guy life performing

3945.599 --> 3950.559
on stage at wave gothic traffic

3948.4 --> 3951.839
but his freaking voice box broke

3950.559 --> 3954.6400000000003
annoying

3951.839 --> 3956.96
but it was still cool to meet him

3954.64 --> 3956.96
and

3957.44 --> 3962.16
now i just listen these four songs

3960.079 --> 3964.1600000000003
have for like the last half year after

3962.16 --> 3965.5989999999997
rediscovering it like it was always

3964.16 --> 3969.44
there

3965.599 --> 3971.28
but the songs and the text are just

3969.44 --> 3973.68
absolutely

3971.28 --> 3976.88
fragile thinking

3973.68 --> 3976.8799999999997
to the highest degree

3976.96 --> 3981.359
and so is like the electronic melodic

3979.92 --> 3983.839
aspect of it

3981.359 --> 3984.88
yeah it's called mind in a box

3983.839 --> 3986.72
very

3984.88 --> 3989.52
unknown

3986.72 --> 3991.839
little band i think they're from germany

3989.52 --> 3993.92
he is might be british i'm not sure i

3991.839 --> 3996.319
think germany though

3993.92 --> 3996.319
and

3996.96 --> 4001.359
yeah

3998.4 --> 4001.359
very retro

4002.24 --> 4006.4799999999996
it's like using

4003.92 --> 4008.88
typical amiga 1200

4006.48 --> 4012.16
style sound effects

4008.88 --> 4012.1600000000003
to like perfection

4012.96 --> 4019.119
very psychological like all the text and

4016.24 --> 4021.839
the music is just hyper psychological i

4019.119 --> 4021.839
love it

4022.4 --> 4026.48
you can find some of their songs on

4024.16 --> 4029.2
youtube

4026.48 --> 4031.359
if you want to hear the best song

4029.2 --> 4032.48
which they have there is just a best

4031.359 --> 4033.68
song

4032.48 --> 4036.2400000000002
that's called

4033.68 --> 4039.5989999999997
between worlds

4036.24 --> 4042.4799999999996
so look that up austrian oh okay

4039.599 --> 4045.2000000000003
that german austrian whatever it's it's

4042.48 --> 4045.2
over there

4047.599 --> 4054.319
i didn't know it was austrian

4050.48 --> 4054.319
anyway it is freaking amazing

4058.96 --> 4063.4
especially like the early works

4068.48 --> 4075.64
i can actually just link you up with one

4070.799 --> 4075.64
of the songs i think let's see

4079.599 --> 4082.48
i still have it

4085.039 --> 4087.6800000000003
i do not

4088.559 --> 4091.8390000000004
search it separately

4107.92 --> 4111.159
what's easy

4127.6 --> 4132.64
right so yeah you want to check out some

4130.96 --> 4134.2390000000005
very serious

4132.64 --> 4137.04
epic

4134.239 --> 4139.919999999999
psychological and spiritual fractal

4137.04 --> 4139.92
thinking based

4140.0 --> 4145.04
cyber electro

4142.48 --> 4147.04
that's that's the song

4145.04 --> 4150.0
i've heard i must have heard it like

4147.04 --> 4152.319
over a thousand times by now

4150.0 --> 4155.52
and it just never gets old

4152.319 --> 4159.04
the only downside is that the

4155.52 --> 4162.080000000001
sound quality is kind of low and so all

4159.04 --> 4164.0
his songs are it's like

4162.08 --> 4166.719
that was what was available so i've

4164.0 --> 4167.839
always kind of longed for like oh wow i

4166.719 --> 4170.56
wish this

4167.839 --> 4173.839
song could be like

4170.56 --> 4175.04
like re-filtered so it would be so much

4173.839 --> 4176.799
smoother

4175.04 --> 4178.859
but yeah i don't know if that could ever

4176.799 --> 4180.159
have or if it even would be as good

4178.859 --> 4183.279
[Music]

4180.159 --> 4185.5199999999995
so it is kind of noisy it's not quality

4183.279 --> 4188.4800000000005
that we're all used to like super super

4185.52 --> 4190.0
crisp and 3d and all that

4188.48 --> 4194.959999999999
it's not like that

4190.0 --> 4198.92
but the melody is just like the best

4194.96 --> 4198.92
loved it anyway

4207.44 --> 4210.96
you have heard that

4209.28 --> 4213.96
okay

4210.96 --> 4213.96
cool

4221.6 --> 4226.56
yeah yeah you can absolutely logical

4224.48 --> 4230.08
conclusion i mean craftware there's a

4226.56 --> 4231.84
lot of really cool electro bands

4230.08 --> 4233.6
software

4231.84 --> 4236.0
being one of them

4233.6 --> 4237.679
and they're like better with live

4236.0 --> 4239.6
performances and all that and they're

4237.679 --> 4240.88
like good music

4239.6 --> 4245.04
but

4240.88 --> 4247.92
mine in a box is like hyper cerebral

4245.04 --> 4251.12
it is it's like

4247.92 --> 4253.1990000000005
literally mine in a box

4251.12 --> 4258.28
it's the best i've ever heard i've never

4253.199 --> 4258.28
heard anything that surpassed it ever

4262.159 --> 4266.96
right and there's a whole bunch of them

4264.56 --> 4270.719
that's too for me no but tool makes you

4266.96 --> 4270.719
freaking depressed i hate to

4271.52 --> 4274.080000000001
they hate it

4274.159 --> 4278.48
they're cold

4276.8 --> 4279.92
right

4278.48 --> 4280.718999999999
mine in the box

4279.92 --> 4283.04
is

4280.719 --> 4284.08
including

4283.04 --> 4287.679
human

4284.08 --> 4290.8
emotion human introspective

4287.679 --> 4293.52
reflection it's the full picture

4290.8 --> 4296.0
it's not like oh i've been intellectual

4293.52 --> 4298.4800000000005
i'm going to ignore

4296.0 --> 4300.88
all kinds of things and emotions oh i'm

4298.48 --> 4303.44
like splunk or something and like

4300.88 --> 4306.88
anti-religious no no

4303.44 --> 4310.0
no mine in a box is actually full

4306.88 --> 4311.84
it is a full human perspective and it is

4310.0 --> 4314.719
freaking amazing

4311.84 --> 4318.8
and it is like the entire works is like

4314.719 --> 4321.84
this the psychological study of people

4318.8 --> 4323.76
it's what his songs are all of them

4321.84 --> 4326.159000000001
no exception

4323.76 --> 4328.400000000001
it's all psychological study of people

4326.159 --> 4330.799999999999
that's what it's about and their

4328.4 --> 4333.44
behavior and behavior patterns and the

4330.8 --> 4335.04
songs i listen to are like direct

4333.44 --> 4337.919999999999
reflections

4335.04 --> 4339.92
of social situations that i'm dealing

4337.92 --> 4341.679
with with you guys and with the flat

4339.92 --> 4343.92
earth debates and with

4341.679 --> 4346.0
with the ballers and anti-flat earthers

4343.92 --> 4349.04
especially there's the entire songs that

4346.0 --> 4351.6
just describe anti-flat earther behavior

4349.04 --> 4354.239
if you notice the patterns it is

4351.6 --> 4357.84
literally that and that's just

4354.239 --> 4357.839999999999
mind-blowing to me

4358.88 --> 4362.32
brenda likes mine in the box

4362.48 --> 4364.799999999999
maybe

4368.96 --> 4372.88
i mean there are some there are some

4370.96 --> 4375.44
like songs in there that are kind of

4372.88 --> 4377.76
depressing i don't like all the music

4375.44 --> 4380.32
that mine in the box made

4377.76 --> 4382.88
i made a very select list

4380.32 --> 4385.679
so you could say like i like

4382.88 --> 4387.12
half to a third of their entire music

4385.679 --> 4389.92
range

4387.12 --> 4391.44
but like yeah there's just a couple of

4389.92 --> 4393.28
songs that are just

4391.44 --> 4395.678999999999
the best ever

4393.28 --> 4397.599999999999
and they just keep i just like you have

4395.679 --> 4398.88
the list and i just keep clicking on

4397.6 --> 4400.64
those songs

4398.88 --> 4402.2390000000005
every time naturally it's like i wanna

4400.64 --> 4403.679
hear that song i wanna hear that song i

4402.239 --> 4405.5199999999995
wanna hear that song

4403.679 --> 4407.52
so then i just concluded okay it's just

4405.52 --> 4411.280000000001
gonna be those four songs then

4407.52 --> 4411.280000000001
i don't really care about the rest

4411.44 --> 4415.919999999999
with number one in between worlds

4419.12 --> 4422.32
mind in the shoes

4425.28 --> 4428.5599999999995
that was a joke brenda saying it could

4426.96 --> 4430.4800000000005
be a brain in the box well she likes to

4428.56 --> 4432.719
argue that yeah

4430.48 --> 4435.04
well there's plenty of songs about com

4432.719 --> 4435.84
about solipsism

4435.04 --> 4438.8
i think

4435.84 --> 4442.96
there might literally be a song

4438.8 --> 4442.96
called solipsism i have to check

4446.4 --> 4450.759999999999
it's gonna be in one of their later

4460.159 --> 4462.96
or maybe not

4464.0 --> 4468.159
but i wouldn't be surprised if there was

4465.76 --> 4470.96
a song literally called solipsism and

4468.159 --> 4473.44
there's like solipsism descriptions

4470.96 --> 4474.88
and like psychological introversy and

4473.44 --> 4475.759999999999
what it's like

4474.88 --> 4478.64
there's

4475.76 --> 4478.64
songs about that

4481.679 --> 4486.88
all right but anyway my favorite ones

4483.76 --> 4488.56
are between worlds

4486.88 --> 4490.159000000001
cause and effect

4488.56 --> 4492.4800000000005
control

4490.159 --> 4496.5199999999995
and crossroads

4492.48 --> 4496.5199999999995
all very fitting names

4498.78 --> 4501.84
[Music]

4502.32 --> 4506.04
right anyway

4511.12 --> 4515.36
not a bad song yeah i know you're

4512.96 --> 4515.36
welcome

4517.199 --> 4522.0
i mean i got the complete library on my

4519.52 --> 4522.0
computer

4522.88 --> 4527.36
it's actually really hard to find all

4524.96 --> 4527.36
his work

4529.28 --> 4533.36
i think they've been suppressed on

4531.199 --> 4534.719
purpose because they're like too

4533.36 --> 4536.719
awakened

4534.719 --> 4538.4800000000005
because it's not like

4536.719 --> 4541.52
i mean like the

4538.48 --> 4544.159
industries don't like it when there's

4541.52 --> 4547.84
like intellectual music that isn't

4544.159 --> 4549.759999999999
emotionally deranged in some way right

4547.84 --> 4551.679
because oh if you are emotionally

4549.76 --> 4553.04
deranged but you're so smart then

4551.679 --> 4555.1990000000005
they're like oh yeah yeah promote them

4553.04 --> 4558.0
promote them oh they're the special boys

4555.199 --> 4560.5599999999995
these are the smart ones so that people

4558.0 --> 4562.8
that are smart are gonna kind of like

4560.56 --> 4565.280000000001
naturally move towards there and then

4562.8 --> 4568.56
have the derangement

4565.28 --> 4570.4
rub off on them yeah

4568.56 --> 4573.52
guess what

4570.4 --> 4576.48
that doesn't happen with mine in a box

4573.52 --> 4577.76
it's actually really confronting

4576.48 --> 4578.799999999999
it is like

4577.76 --> 4580.400000000001
music

4578.8 --> 4582.320000000001
like even if you were isolated if you

4580.4 --> 4584.5599999999995
just listen to that music you're gonna

4582.32 --> 4586.96
have introspective reflection just

4584.56 --> 4589.280000000001
listening to that music so yeah the

4586.96 --> 4592.32
industry doesn't like that

4589.28 --> 4592.32
surprise surprise

4593.36 --> 4598.48
um

4595.84 --> 4600.0
because music industry is kind of

4598.48 --> 4602.639999999999
satanic

4600.0 --> 4604.88
they want things to basically be

4602.64 --> 4608.320000000001
deranged in some way and then have that

4604.88 --> 4610.88
derangement rough off on the people it's

4608.32 --> 4610.88
part of their

4620.84 --> 4626.719
scheme getting this self-promotion okay

4623.84 --> 4626.719
lennox that's fine

4632.159 --> 4635.799999999999
i'll check it out

4642.96 --> 4647.08
wait that sound looks familiar

4656.56 --> 4659.56
hmm

4673.84 --> 4677.0
like that

4702.239 --> 4704.48
okay

4704.88 --> 4709.04
all right

4706.48 --> 4710.959999999999
i'll check it out sometime

4709.04 --> 4715.28
but not during the show though

4710.96 --> 4715.28
and like it's a 40-minute video so

4716.88 --> 4721.84
well check it out i'll get back to you

4718.719 --> 4721.84
about it

4737.12 --> 4742.88
way more in a vacuum yes

4740.239 --> 4742.879999999999
yes we do

4743.04 --> 4745.6
because the

4751.92 --> 4757.92
relative density

4754.88 --> 4760.4800000000005
differential is maximized

4757.92 --> 4764.56
in a vacuum

4760.48 --> 4768.08
so an object in vacuum is surrounded by

4764.56 --> 4769.360000000001
extremely low density average

4768.08 --> 4770.239
medium

4769.36 --> 4773.44
so

4770.239 --> 4775.919999999999
that will cause the differential

4773.44 --> 4777.839999999999
the actual thing that introduces the

4775.92 --> 4780.2390000000005
force

4777.84 --> 4782.08
through relative density on the object

4780.239 --> 4783.04
it's going to be maximized so it's going

4782.08 --> 4785.199
to have

4783.04 --> 4788.8
the maximum

4785.199 --> 4791.599999999999
weight potential you could say

4788.8 --> 4794.64
right in comparison to when just being

4791.6 --> 4796.8
surrounded by regular air

4794.64 --> 4799.04
at normal pressure

4796.8 --> 4802.2390000000005
because that medium is

4799.04 --> 4804.4
well slightly denser than a vacuum

4802.239 --> 4806.239
so yes it's going to add on to the

4804.4 --> 4808.879999999999
effective weight

4806.239 --> 4811.36
relative density this equilibrium

4808.88 --> 4811.36
pressure

4811.92 --> 4816.639
so it's going to weigh slightly more in

4814.8 --> 4819.639
a vacuum

4816.639 --> 4819.639
correct

4822.32 --> 4825.199
sorry for answering your question so

4824.32 --> 4829.639
late

4825.199 --> 4829.638999999999
dj1 deck house music

4841.6 --> 4844.6
uh

4863.44 --> 4867.66
we can see

4865.84 --> 4872.229
the web

4867.66 --> 4872.229
[Music]

4901.93 --> 4905.129
[Music]

4908.56 --> 4912.320000000001
right so you guys want to talk about

4910.159 --> 4916.28
some flat earth i mean it's like music

4912.32 --> 4916.28
and oh that's cute

4918.56 --> 4922.88
and a good opportunity to uh yeah

4920.96 --> 4925.28
connect people up to some really good

4922.88 --> 4925.28
music

4925.76 --> 4930.159000000001
of course that's not the typical subject

4927.84 --> 4932.159000000001
of my show

4930.159 --> 4935.638999999999
i don't even play music on my show

4932.159 --> 4935.638999999999
except my intro

4956.56 --> 4961.679
what was one science thing you learned

4958.88 --> 4965.12
that just clicked

4961.679 --> 4968.4800000000005
uh relative density

4965.12 --> 4970.4
because i did a rather density or

4968.48 --> 4972.48
density law

4970.4 --> 4974.48
because i did learn about that even in

4972.48 --> 4976.4
school i was like

4974.48 --> 4980.08
15 or 16

4976.4 --> 4982.5599999999995
and i did learn about that separately

4980.08 --> 4984.4
because i i continued asking

4982.56 --> 4987.6
because i was the guy that would never

4984.4 --> 4990.159
stop continuing the inquiry

4987.6 --> 4991.92
and it was kind of annoying sometimes

4990.159 --> 4992.96
that then the teacher would just take me

4991.92 --> 4995.36
separate

4992.96 --> 4997.12
afterward and just discuss it with me

4995.36 --> 4999.12
that's when i realized like oh wait

4997.12 --> 5000.88
gravity is just a model it's not

4999.12 --> 5003.199
actually the real thing the real thing

5000.88 --> 5004.639
is relative density it wasn't called

5003.199 --> 5006.32
relatives you just called it like

5004.639 --> 5008.4800000000005
density loss

5006.32 --> 5010.4
and there is no gravity

5008.48 --> 5012.638999999999
but i didn't understand it back then i

5010.4 --> 5016.239
was like what hmm

5012.639 --> 5019.28
what but why

5016.239 --> 5020.638999999999
and i just kind of forgot about it

5019.28 --> 5022.4
and now

5020.639 --> 5025.1990000000005
since 2015

5022.4 --> 5027.599999999999
with the crew from nathan oakley

5025.199 --> 5029.759999999999
we've yeah figured out like

5027.6 --> 5031.92
or i got back to that

5029.76 --> 5034.2390000000005
and then actually was able to work it

5031.92 --> 5037.92
out now to really figure out what's

5034.239 --> 5040.4
going on and why and how it works and

5037.92 --> 5042.4
to get a grasp on that thing that i kind

5040.4 --> 5045.92
of learned when it was much younger but

5042.4 --> 5049.36
it didn't really stick too much

5045.92 --> 5049.36
i did get to hear it though

5054.0 --> 5057.84
and then it was just called density

5059.199 --> 5064.239
right so the relative density is a

5062.8 --> 5066.2390000000005
rebranding

5064.239 --> 5070.239
a new name

5066.239 --> 5071.44
to a formula that has been out there

5070.239 --> 5072.48
forever

5071.44 --> 5075.28
since

5072.48 --> 5077.5199999999995
physics kind of started

5075.28 --> 5080.08
like post newton

5077.52 --> 5083.4400000000005
because newton's model is incomplete it

5080.08 --> 5086.0
doesn't account for gas behavior

5083.44 --> 5088.4
and the only way to rectify that

5086.0 --> 5090.8
mathematically is

5088.4 --> 5093.44
or yeah model wise is to

5090.8 --> 5096.4800000000005
reduce or to ignore gas behavior and

5093.44 --> 5099.199
classify it as a fluid

5096.48 --> 5102.32
and then it kind of works

5099.199 --> 5105.44
but it's still gonna like ignore the gas

5102.32 --> 5106.88
behavior aspect of the fluid

5105.44 --> 5109.36
that would be gas

5106.88 --> 5113.639
right so it's an incomplete model

5109.36 --> 5113.639
gravity doesn't actually work

5113.84 --> 5117.92
and it's not provable there's no proof

5115.92 --> 5120.8
word you can't scientifically prove it

5117.92 --> 5122.2390000000005
you can't very manipulate it

5120.8 --> 5125.28
right

5122.239 --> 5127.759999999999
and the effects attributed to gravity

5125.28 --> 5130.96
separated effects are all

5127.76 --> 5133.92
very provable to be caused by relative

5130.96 --> 5135.6
density which you can experiment with

5133.92 --> 5137.36
very easily

5135.6 --> 5139.92
and prove

5137.36 --> 5143.839999999999
that changing the density of object or

5139.92 --> 5146.08
medium will cause direct

5143.84 --> 5150.92
relative density disequilibrium which

5146.08 --> 5150.92
will result in displacement or pressure

5155.199 --> 5159.678999999999
oh

5156.4 --> 5159.679
okay matty matty

5162.88 --> 5170.639
love my voice okay

5166.239 --> 5172.239
i'm glad you like it that does help

5170.639 --> 5174.400000000001
if you don't like my voice yeah it's

5172.239 --> 5177.4
gonna be quite a chore to sit through my

5174.4 --> 5177.4
show

5184.639 --> 5189.1990000000005
dynamics is interesting yes it is right

5186.96 --> 5190.4
akuma virus i agree fluid dynamics is

5189.199 --> 5192.32
interesting

5190.4 --> 5194.719
it's all it's basically another branch

5192.32 --> 5197.36
of turbulence right the patterns of

5194.719 --> 5199.28
displacement

5197.36 --> 5201.839999999999
with fluids

5199.28 --> 5203.36
well yeah aerodynamics

5201.84 --> 5205.52
hydrodynamics

5203.36 --> 5207.199
fluid dynamics it's super interesting

5205.52 --> 5209.679
the patterns right

5207.199 --> 5211.44
but none of it is actually directly

5209.679 --> 5215.28
related

5211.44 --> 5217.919999999999
to gravity or relative density

5215.28 --> 5219.12
it's not about that it's about

5217.92 --> 5221.4400000000005
how

5219.12 --> 5222.239
will it move

5221.44 --> 5225.04
with

5222.239 --> 5227.12
the various influences

5225.04 --> 5228.96
and that's really interesting i love

5227.12 --> 5230.4
like turbulence patterns are very

5228.96 --> 5232.32
fascinating to me because they're

5230.4 --> 5234.719
fractal

5232.32 --> 5238.719
and they are actually predictable that's

5234.719 --> 5241.6
why like aerodynamic designs work

5238.719 --> 5243.6
because it is very predictable

5241.6 --> 5245.6
if you figure out how it works

5243.6 --> 5247.76
aerodynamics then you can literally

5245.6 --> 5249.92
adapt the design and it will just work

5247.76 --> 5252.96
out

5249.92 --> 5257.28
i have to keep testing it though because

5252.96 --> 5260.0
always be like branch off effects even

5257.28 --> 5262.719
yeah you smooth out one element

5260.0 --> 5264.8
but then there will probably be another

5262.719 --> 5267.679
unexpected side effect so you basically

5264.8 --> 5270.08
gotta keep testing remodeling something

5267.679 --> 5271.28
until it just shows that the perfect

5270.08 --> 5273.84
result

5271.28 --> 5277.199
and that's how they yeah design like

5273.84 --> 5279.76
high-speed airplanes and all that

5277.199 --> 5283.199
keep keep modifying modifying until like

5279.76 --> 5283.1990000000005
the aerodynamics are perfect

5284.96 --> 5287.28
anyway

5290.8 --> 5295.76
although at this point aerodynamics

5293.36 --> 5297.679
designed from planes might be so fully

5295.76 --> 5300.08
understood that they just

5297.679 --> 5301.92
simulated in models

5300.08 --> 5304.5599999999995
most of the time

5301.92 --> 5305.92
they don't even have to really build a

5304.56 --> 5307.4400000000005
new

5305.92 --> 5309.6
until they get it right because they

5307.44 --> 5311.919999999999
probably have been testing it so many

5309.6 --> 5315.1990000000005
times in so many ways that it's just

5311.92 --> 5318.32
like a standard pattern model that

5315.199 --> 5320.719
that a computer can calculate for you

5318.32 --> 5323.199
at this point at least for some mega

5320.719 --> 5324.88
corporations that are really big into

5323.199 --> 5327.04
that sort of design

5324.88 --> 5328.639
they'll have that because it's so much

5327.04 --> 5332.08
cheaper to just simulate it in a

5328.639 --> 5334.719
computer based on empirical results

5332.08 --> 5337.6
than to actually keep rebuilding

5334.719 --> 5339.28
an aerodynamic design physically to test

5337.6 --> 5342.280000000001
it

5339.28 --> 5342.28
anyway

5356.88 --> 5361.28
effectiveness

5358.239 --> 5361.28
huh what does that mean

5363.12 --> 5366.5599999999995
so nervous

5365.12 --> 5369.5599999999995
somewhere

5366.56 --> 5369.56
what

5369.75 --> 5372.96
[Music]

5380.639 --> 5385.92
imposingly deep and full oh really

5383.36 --> 5387.679
dammit that really

5385.92 --> 5391.52
okay

5387.679 --> 5391.52
well i do do my best to

5391.679 --> 5397.6
make as good a use of my low tones when

5395.04 --> 5399.6
they are available because my voice can

5397.6 --> 5402.0
kind of get all over the place sometimes

5399.6 --> 5403.1990000000005
a bit scratchy sometimes i don't have to

5402.0 --> 5405.28
reach

5403.199 --> 5408.0
with the low voice as much and then i

5405.28 --> 5410.08
kind of stick to more high not like that

5408.0 --> 5412.32
but

5410.08 --> 5413.199
my vocal cords have a very wide range

5412.32 --> 5416.009999999999
from

5413.199 --> 5418.839999999999
like tanor not bass to nor to

5416.01 --> 5423.280000000001
[Music]

5418.84 --> 5426.2390000000005
what's uh uh not the highest

5423.28 --> 5429.12
one before that so not

5426.239 --> 5431.36
wow what is the order of all those tones

5429.12 --> 5431.36
again

5435.199 --> 5439.759999999999
soprano

5436.56 --> 5439.76
soprano was the highest

5439.84 --> 5446.2390000000005
i forgot my music lore is failing me

5444.32 --> 5450.5599999999995
right but i have a decent

5446.239 --> 5453.678999999999
voice range and i have trained my

5450.56 --> 5457.52
my lower voice a lot also because i use

5453.679 --> 5457.52
it therapeutically because

5457.84 --> 5463.6
is actually therapeutical

5461.04 --> 5465.76
so when i'm like excited

5463.6 --> 5468.96
and i get getting nervous from that

5465.76 --> 5470.159000000001
using my bass voice actually is like

5468.96 --> 5473.199
literally

5470.159 --> 5474.96
therapeutic it's massaging

5473.199 --> 5478.0
so there's all kinds of benefits even

5474.96 --> 5478.88
for myself being alone using my low

5478.0 --> 5481.28
voice

5478.88 --> 5482.88
and i kind of like low singing i i think

5481.28 --> 5486.0
it's very beautiful

5482.88 --> 5487.28
i like like gregorian

5486.0 --> 5488.4
style

5487.28 --> 5491.12
low

5488.4 --> 5493.199
men singing in classical in church and

5491.12 --> 5494.96
all that i love that i i love the the

5493.199 --> 5497.839999999999
dwarfs the song

5494.96 --> 5499.6
in the hobbit right all low voice i love

5497.84 --> 5500.88
that

5499.6 --> 5502.719
baritone

5500.88 --> 5505.84
right

5502.719 --> 5505.84
thank you

5515.28 --> 5519.679
when i was a little kid my vocal chords

5517.52 --> 5522.080000000001
were so wide range that i could

5519.679 --> 5524.88
literally make a chirping sound from a

5522.08 --> 5527.76
cricket in such a way that it was like

5524.88 --> 5530.2390000000005
really loud just as a real cricket

5527.76 --> 5532.320000000001
and that my parents were and they have

5530.239 --> 5534.48
good hearing they were unable to

5532.32 --> 5536.239
distinguish my chirping from the real

5534.48 --> 5537.04
thing

5536.239 --> 5540.159
i

5537.04 --> 5542.96
can't do that anymore now

5540.159 --> 5546.0
like no that only worked as a kid i kind

5542.96 --> 5548.32
of lost that ability when it was

5546.0 --> 5551.679
when i grew up

5548.32 --> 5554.639
like at 13 or something

5551.679 --> 5556.719
when purity hit

5554.639 --> 5558.400000000001
i still remember like just like

5556.719 --> 5560.8
literally being able to make the sound

5558.4 --> 5563.28
of a cricket and it was identical it's

5560.8 --> 5563.28
crazy

5563.92 --> 5570.32
fascinating to be able to do that

5567.6 --> 5572.56
i felt like i was just a voice recorder

5570.32 --> 5576.32
i could just literally mimic sounds like

5572.56 --> 5576.320000000001
that like a voice recorder

5584.96 --> 5587.6
anyway thanks for the compliments and

5586.56 --> 5590.8
all that

5587.6 --> 5590.8
glad you appreciate it

5598.08 --> 5602.6
okay psychics traveler

5613.28 --> 5620.4
a trip to see you in person but have you

5616.88 --> 5623.28
seen me in purpose in person

5620.4 --> 5623.28
matty matty

5623.44 --> 5628.199
i don't remember have we met in person

5658.159 --> 5661.159
anyway

5674.159 --> 5677.159
hmm

5685.75 --> 5692.29
[Music]

5704.719 --> 5706.96
ah

5710.239 --> 5717.08
all right nathan is having a live show

5712.08 --> 5717.08
good oh just started raining out here

5720.4 --> 5723.5199999999995
[Music]

5740.84 --> 5743.4400000000005
uh

5742.48 --> 5747.718999999999
okay

5743.44 --> 5747.719
getting really poetic there

5759.199 --> 5762.199
efficaciousness

5763.119 --> 5766.119
what

5779.6 --> 5785.400000000001
ah okay so effective productive

5782.4 --> 5785.4
hmm

5792.96 --> 5798.4800000000005
yeah i don't think i like i can't really

5795.52 --> 5801.52
techno babel to that level

5798.48 --> 5805.599999999999
because everything you said is like

5801.52 --> 5806.400000000001
i'm reading it is ordered it's just that

5805.6 --> 5810.159000000001
my

5806.4 --> 5811.679
typical vernacular in communication

5810.159 --> 5814.96
i tried to

5811.679 --> 5816.719
keep it very effective

5814.96 --> 5818.88
but not like

5816.719 --> 5820.56
too broad too

5818.88 --> 5822.56
complicated

5820.56 --> 5826.159000000001
because i want people to be able to

5822.56 --> 5829.04
follow my most complicated thinking if

5826.159 --> 5830.96
you use like more techno babble more

5829.04 --> 5833.199
appropriate words

5830.96 --> 5835.6
it'll help like

5833.199 --> 5838.0
give people respect for you

5835.6 --> 5840.719
but it will not necessarily help them

5838.0 --> 5843.04
understand what you're saying better

5840.719 --> 5843.04
you see

5843.36 --> 5848.639
so i never go like full

5847.92 --> 5850.159
like

5848.639 --> 5852.32
languist

5850.159 --> 5855.5199999999995
linguists

5852.32 --> 5857.759999999999
poetic like you did

5855.52 --> 5860.159000000001
i mean maybe in text i might do that

5857.76 --> 5863.1990000000005
sometimes if i really see a spot for it

5860.159 --> 5865.599999999999
but verbally i i try to keep things a

5863.199 --> 5868.159
little simple like i mean

5865.6 --> 5870.4800000000005
nathan oakley uses slightly more

5868.159 --> 5873.679
advanced english and why he is british

5870.48 --> 5875.919999999999
after all but on a higher degree

5873.679 --> 5878.4800000000005
than my vernacular

5875.92 --> 5880.0
it is perfectly compatible though i do

5878.48 --> 5882.48
understand what he says and he

5880.0 --> 5885.48
definitely understands what i say

5882.48 --> 5885.48
usually

5896.239 --> 5900.5599999999995
never in person thought it'd be okay

5898.32 --> 5900.5599999999995
okay

5901.199 --> 5904.199
cool

5918.8 --> 5921.8
hmm

5924.719 --> 5931.04
my english is great thank you

5927.679 --> 5933.119
it's good it's good enough i mean it's

5931.04 --> 5935.44
there i say better than

5933.119 --> 5936.719
average native english speakers even

5935.44 --> 5939.119
sometimes

5936.719 --> 5942.0
they just go on another track

5939.119 --> 5945.04
over simplification

5942.0 --> 5947.84
oh yeah it just becomes their normal

5945.04 --> 5949.199
but i always try to reach very high with

5947.84 --> 5952.4800000000005
my english

5949.199 --> 5955.678999999999
but i know there's it can get more

5952.48 --> 5959.119
complicated more poetic more precise

5955.679 --> 5959.119
even wider i just

5959.76 --> 5964.96
maybe like if i keep doing this then in

5962.639 --> 5968.400000000001
like 10 years or something i might be

5964.96 --> 5970.719
able to like upgrade my quality even

5968.4 --> 5972.239
but at this point i'm just trying to

5970.719 --> 5976.4800000000005
perfect

5972.239 --> 5976.48
the typical level at where i talk

5976.8 --> 5983.4400000000005
so for me i prioritize being understood

5980.32 --> 5985.759999999999
like you being effective with

5983.44 --> 5987.44
the construction of the word range you

5985.76 --> 5991.360000000001
have

5987.44 --> 5992.638999999999
i prioritize being understood over being

5991.36 --> 5995.599999999999
high level

5992.639 --> 5997.92
in my vernacular

5995.6 --> 6000.2390000000005
you think matty is a bot

5997.92 --> 6000.2390000000005
okay

6002.88 --> 6006.1990000000005
that's weird

6011.52 --> 6014.88
i hadn't thought of that maybe

6019.84 --> 6024.08
i wouldn't even assume english is a

6021.76 --> 6027.04
second language for me right well rick

6024.08 --> 6027.04
back at this point

6028.639 --> 6032.400000000001
you know

6030.719 --> 6035.52
arguably

6032.4 --> 6037.599999999999
i'm better at english than i'm dutch

6035.52 --> 6040.2390000000005
because i've just

6037.6 --> 6042.400000000001
the amount of english that i've spoken

6040.239 --> 6045.28
the preponderance of it

6042.4 --> 6046.08
is starting to outgrow the preponderance

6045.28 --> 6047.679
of

6046.08 --> 6051.119
dutch that i've talked in my life

6047.679 --> 6052.08
because i'm talking a lot these last few

6051.119 --> 6054.159
years

6052.08 --> 6057.4
much more than i have in total before

6054.159 --> 6057.4
all of that

6082.48 --> 6088.638999999999
wait matty are you that

6085.92 --> 6091.04
that kind of techno babbling guy that

6088.639 --> 6093.76
was very well spoken that came in like a

6091.04 --> 6096.32
month ago over in in discord over nathan

6093.76 --> 6096.320000000001
oakley's

6096.48 --> 6100.959999999999
is that you because he was also like

6098.88 --> 6105.119
making

6100.96 --> 6105.119
a lot of effort to sound really

6105.44 --> 6108.799999999999
high level vernacular

6110.0 --> 6114.32
is that you is that the guy that came on

6112.48 --> 6116.718999999999
nathan oakley's like a month ago

6114.32 --> 6116.719
somewhere

6118.32 --> 6122.92
or are you like new to this scene

6143.52 --> 6148.159000000001
funny how many non-native english

6145.84 --> 6149.92
speakers end up with american accent

6148.159 --> 6153.44
it's not surprising though logical

6149.92 --> 6155.76
conclusion i mean

6153.44 --> 6158.28
the only logical conclusion is is that

6155.76 --> 6161.6
the amount of

6158.28 --> 6164.159
american-style spoken media that the

6161.6 --> 6167.92
entire world is being exposed to

6164.159 --> 6170.96
outweighs the amount of typical british

6167.92 --> 6170.96
spoken english

6171.199 --> 6176.0
so yeah

6173.36 --> 6178.08
now if you're in england then you're

6176.0 --> 6178.96
going to be outnumbered

6178.08 --> 6181.44
by

6178.96 --> 6183.36
british spoken language so you're

6181.44 --> 6185.919999999999
definitely going to adapt to that then

6183.36 --> 6188.4
that becomes the norm but all around the

6185.92 --> 6191.84
world like hollywood and all that yes

6188.4 --> 6194.239
some of it may be a bit british but the

6191.84 --> 6195.6
dominant majority is gonna be kind of

6194.239 --> 6198.08
american

6195.6 --> 6200.0
so that's gonna rub off even on the

6198.08 --> 6202.159
surface with most people

6200.0 --> 6205.6
so it's not surprising that

6202.159 --> 6209.199
most people that will adopt

6205.6 --> 6210.2390000000005
english as a second language

6209.199 --> 6213.759999999999
will

6210.239 --> 6216.879999999999
kind of do it american

6213.76 --> 6219.1990000000005
unless they have like a real law for the

6216.88 --> 6221.119
british accent

6219.199 --> 6223.71
try to focus

6221.119 --> 6224.96
on pronouncing things more british

6223.71 --> 6227.44
[Music]

6224.96 --> 6229.6
and then they just do that

6227.44 --> 6231.44
i mean i can do it but it it like

6229.6 --> 6234.2390000000005
requires me

6231.44 --> 6236.159
to like put in extra effort it's like

6234.239 --> 6238.799999999999
it's acting

6236.159 --> 6240.0
when i do that i i have to like act

6238.8 --> 6242.400000000001
british

6240.0 --> 6245.76
and like really pay attention

6242.4 --> 6249.04
to how i pronounce things

6245.76 --> 6250.159000000001
and then i become more british sounding

6249.04 --> 6253.44
you see

6250.159 --> 6256.4
just require the little concentration

6253.44 --> 6259.799999999999
but still the american will slip through

6256.4 --> 6259.799999999999
here and there

6263.93 --> 6267.069
[Music]

6272.32 --> 6276.159
even as a kid i still remember like it

6274.159 --> 6278.4
was on the beach it was like they're

6276.159 --> 6282.799999999999
like 14 years old and some kid there was

6278.4 --> 6285.759999999999
from england a totally palmy accent

6282.8 --> 6287.76
and i actually convinced that kid that i

6285.76 --> 6290.2390000000005
was also from england

6287.76 --> 6292.400000000001
using a british accent

6290.239 --> 6294.08
he was fully convinced that i was

6292.4 --> 6298.199
british

6294.08 --> 6298.199
which is hilarious to me

6303.6 --> 6307.84
original slang

6305.44 --> 6312.919999999999
english dude there's so many different

6307.84 --> 6312.92
types of slang there it's crazy lynn

6334.639 --> 6340.0
oh i love that

6336.719 --> 6343.0
i love that word indubitably

6340.0 --> 6343.0
indubitably

6343.199 --> 6349.44
first heard that word in

6345.679 --> 6350.719
like the avalon trilogy

6349.44 --> 6353.04
in

6350.719 --> 6356.0
gargoyles

6353.04 --> 6359.28
or like the sorcerer

6356.0 --> 6361.76
uses that word which is like awesome

6359.28 --> 6364.239
awesome bit in that little cartoon

6361.76 --> 6364.2390000000005
series

6364.4 --> 6367.36
intubatively

6368.48 --> 6373.119
but yeah my my vernacular or like my

6371.28 --> 6376.159
accent doesn't do it justice you have to

6373.119 --> 6378.88
say it like proper british and like real

6376.159 --> 6381.679
not just like proper knees and british

6378.88 --> 6383.04
but really like oxford

6381.679 --> 6385.52
complete

6383.04 --> 6388.96
fully around it

6385.52 --> 6388.96
and then it's beautiful

6397.44 --> 6401.4
the kid must have been deaf

6401.6 --> 6403.92
or

6405.52 --> 6410.0
it just thought i was from a slight look

6408.56 --> 6412.0
if you're a little kid

6410.0 --> 6414.08
then you're already in england right you

6412.0 --> 6416.32
already know like oh yeah you just go

6414.08 --> 6417.6
100 kilometers in there or miles in that

6416.32 --> 6419.599999999999
direction

6417.6 --> 6422.0
and suddenly you can barely understand

6419.6 --> 6423.6
what people are saying so he probably

6422.0 --> 6426.639
just assumed like oh yeah that kind of

6423.6 --> 6426.639
sounds like england

6427.04 --> 6432.639
i mean it was kind of just a little kid

6429.28 --> 6432.639
it was like 10 or something

6439.679 --> 6442.639
i don't

6440.84 --> 6445.4400000000005
know

6442.639 --> 6449.0
it wasn't death

6445.44 --> 6449.0
definitely not

6474.88 --> 6478.719
yeah but a kumo virus if you say

6476.96 --> 6481.92
indubitably

6478.719 --> 6482.719
like an american that just sounds really

6481.92 --> 6485.52
dumb

6482.719 --> 6488.32
that sounds like somebody that's

6485.52 --> 6490.080000000001
just trying to sound smart

6488.32 --> 6492.639
if you say it american it just sounds

6490.08 --> 6492.639
stupid

6493.36 --> 6497.4
you have to say it papa

6505.39 --> 6508.469
[Music]

6533.92 --> 6538.56
i know slow mo moon buggy

6537.36 --> 6540.4
dude

6538.56 --> 6542.2390000000005
i don't know what it is maybe it's a guy

6540.4 --> 6544.32
that's just in a poetic mode maybe he's

6542.239 --> 6546.48
trying out some kind of a charm troll or

6544.32 --> 6548.32
whatever i don't know

6546.48 --> 6550.32
i don't have any direct objection of

6548.32 --> 6552.719
having this guy in my chat but if he

6550.32 --> 6556.08
keeps spamming though then eventually i

6552.719 --> 6556.08
will probably time them out

6559.44 --> 6565.199
because this is not

6561.84 --> 6566.96
like a poetry corner i mean i appreciate

6565.199 --> 6569.04
your vernacular

6566.96 --> 6571.44
but this is not the place where you just

6569.04 --> 6573.92
blah blah blah blah like we're actually

6571.44 --> 6575.919999999999
interacting here

6573.92 --> 6578.56
right so

6575.92 --> 6581.119
if people ask you questions

6578.56 --> 6582.96
and you avoid answering them

6581.119 --> 6586.5199999999995
you become suspect

6582.96 --> 6586.52
just so you know

6616.32 --> 6619.599
right

6617.599 --> 6622.4800000000005
because yeah there is a considerable

6619.599 --> 6626.2390000000005
chance matty here is simply

6622.48 --> 6628.48
an ai system that is just trying to see

6626.239 --> 6629.919999999999
how far it needs to go before i'll

6628.48 --> 6631.5199999999995
accept it in

6629.92 --> 6634.96
you see

6631.52 --> 6634.96
very well aware that there is

6635.36 --> 6640.5599999999995
really hostile forces out there

6638.48 --> 6643.36
that are

6640.56 --> 6646.400000000001
inconsolable like they they will not

6643.36 --> 6647.92
stop no matter what and they go over our

6646.4 --> 6650.48
head

6647.92 --> 6653.4400000000005
they go over our typical human comfort

6650.48 --> 6655.678999999999
zone they'll do anything to infiltrate

6653.44 --> 6658.5599999999995
somehow they'll do anything they can

6655.679 --> 6662.32
think of every opportunity

6658.56 --> 6664.56
so i am on average quite paranoid

6662.32 --> 6666.4
because i've i'm seeing this happen i

6664.56 --> 6668.8
literally see this happen right in front

6666.4 --> 6671.36
of me i do not care

6668.8 --> 6674.159000000001
whatsoever about people's opinions over

6671.36 --> 6678.32
that because i know i'm right i know

6674.159 --> 6678.32
that happens i know it's trying

6679.36 --> 6683.92
so yeah that that's basically the

6681.76 --> 6685.599
standard test and slo-mo moon bug is

6683.92 --> 6687.36
very well aware about these things i

6685.599 --> 6691.04
really like you slo-mo

6687.36 --> 6691.04
you're like our resident

6691.36 --> 6695.598999999999
chat spy

6692.8 --> 6699.04
i really appreciate your input

6695.599 --> 6702.2390000000005
but yeah you're right it is very suspect

6699.04 --> 6706.159
and especially when questions are asked

6702.239 --> 6706.159
and they're not directly answered

6706.84 --> 6710.4800000000005
right

6708.4 --> 6712.96
if it's just going to be a standardized

6710.48 --> 6714.959999999999
avoidance comment to move on and

6712.96 --> 6716.8
continue the train

6714.96 --> 6719.119
then it's very likely to be bought

6716.8 --> 6722.2390000000005
activity unless there is a direct

6719.119 --> 6724.799999999999
answering of the question that literally

6722.239 --> 6726.4
answers the question that was asked in

6724.8 --> 6728.320000000001
that very moment

6726.4 --> 6730.0
right and typical

6728.32 --> 6732.719
chat bots

6730.0 --> 6734.88
simply have not evolved to the level of

6732.719 --> 6737.84
complexity where they can deal with that

6734.88 --> 6737.84
kind of dynamic

6752.239 --> 6756.32
right because what he's doing now is

6753.76 --> 6757.76
simply word fishing he's picking up

6756.32 --> 6759.04
words

6757.76 --> 6762.0
and then just

6759.04 --> 6765.0
assembling them in some sort of poetic

6762.0 --> 6765.0
fashion

6767.52 --> 6773.1990000000005
right but it's not communication

6770.159 --> 6773.199
it's artistry

6776.0 --> 6780.239
and yeah a robot can do that

6780.4 --> 6786.08
matty so as far as i'm concerned you're

6782.96 --> 6786.08
potentially a robot

6788.56 --> 6792.96
what do you say about that maddie

6790.88 --> 6795.96
you're potentially a robot what do you

6792.96 --> 6795.96
say

6809.7 --> 6812.91
[Music]

6828.639 --> 6831.639
mm-hmm

6847.92 --> 6851.4400000000005
yeah

6850.159 --> 6853.759999999999
that's

6851.44 --> 6857.759999999999
very cute it was very entertaining while

6853.76 --> 6857.76
you were there but uh yeah this is

6858.48 --> 6862.718999999999
this is going to be the only stream

6860.48 --> 6866.0
where you're going to be on in my chat

6862.719 --> 6868.08
because i don't want bots in my chat i

6866.0 --> 6870.159
want people in my chat i'm not going to

6868.08 --> 6873.679
ban you because i want to leave all this

6870.159 --> 6875.5199999999995
blabbering that you did out there

6873.679 --> 6878.0
but uh

6875.52 --> 6881.84
yeah i'm not going to keep you around

6878.0 --> 6881.84
matibot just so you know

6884.0 --> 6888.639
no you can't linux

6887.119 --> 6890.719
links

6888.639 --> 6895.08
bullshitter

6890.719 --> 6895.08
what he's your butt isn't he

6912.239 --> 6916.839999999999
yeah i'm sorry but

6914.08 --> 6921.5199999999995
it doesn't work with me you get

6916.84 --> 6924.159000000001
it i'm effectively telepathic

6921.52 --> 6927.280000000001
you can't [ __ ] with me like that like
