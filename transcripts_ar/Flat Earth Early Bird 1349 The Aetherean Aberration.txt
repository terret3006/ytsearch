126.079 --> 130.319

150.239 --> 152.879
nathan r

153.84 --> 159.84
it is tuesday the 30th of august 2022.

158.5 --> 162.239
[Music]

159.84 --> 164.0
hello susie s

162.239 --> 166.16
ah

164.0 --> 168.48
you're all in early

166.16 --> 168.48
nice

168.64 --> 171.64
right

171.68 --> 176.56
oh

172.959 --> 176.56
so yeah i feel pretty good

182.48 --> 187.84
went about a bit late but

185.12 --> 191.36
not extremely

187.84 --> 191.36
i think i had a good sleep

191.92 --> 196.48
don't yeah i feel less tired than i did

194.72 --> 199.48
yesterday

196.48 --> 199.48
uh

199.92 --> 203.28
right but yesterday's show was

201.599 --> 206.23899999999998
interesting

203.28 --> 208.159
and before i'm gonna forget about it i

206.239 --> 210.159
just noticed just a tiny little

208.159 --> 212.239
synchronicity i was watching on benjamin

210.159 --> 215.04
from yesterday

212.239 --> 218.31900000000002
episode 1480 now

215.04 --> 221.84
into unit 51

218.319 --> 221.83999999999997
but he brought up the challenger

222.319 --> 226.72
and then he put it down

224.319 --> 229.83999999999997
exactly well

226.72 --> 232.239
from a different perspective

229.84 --> 234.56
but he basically yeah it's so funny

232.239 --> 236.72
because i think yesterday

234.56 --> 238.319
somebody asked me too like oh they're

236.72 --> 240.48
gonna

238.319 --> 242.72
blow up another rocket

240.48 --> 244.72
and then i said like no no no they did

242.72 --> 246.48
that with the challenger because they

244.72 --> 248.879
wanted to discourage everybody from

246.48 --> 251.35999999999999
going to the moon well guess what owen

248.879 --> 254.64
benjamin had like a whole skit

251.36 --> 255.519
about exactly that

254.64 --> 256.56
about

255.519 --> 258.56
like

256.56 --> 261.12
little tvs being rolled into the

258.56 --> 262.96
classroom just to show that thing

261.12 --> 265.04
exploding

262.96 --> 269.15999999999997
and it's just like wow

265.04 --> 269.16
did he watch my show

270.8 --> 276.56
or are we just

273.52 --> 280.71999999999997
getting the same idea at the same time

276.56 --> 283.12
it's it's really funny when that happens

280.72 --> 285.52000000000004
but yeah it was a very cool very cool

283.12 --> 285.52
skit

288.32 --> 293.199
so that was funny

290.88 --> 293.199
uh

293.28 --> 297.28
let's see yeah yesterday's flat earth

295.12 --> 300.16
debate was great

297.28 --> 300.15999999999997
pretty long show

300.4 --> 307.52
and yeah etherean oh it was again

304.479 --> 311.039
ethereans aetherians

307.52 --> 313.12
and went pretty hard and hard

311.039 --> 315.68
multiple people and

313.12 --> 318.4
nathan yeah it was like the ethereans

315.68 --> 320.40000000000003
are the new ballers

318.4 --> 322.79999999999995
i guess that the anti-flat earthers have

320.4 --> 325.75899999999996
just run out

322.8 --> 327.759
run out of juice run out of points

325.759 --> 329.52000000000004
and the aetherians are now making their

327.759 --> 332.639
move

329.52 --> 334.639
and yeah we're we're ready for it

332.639 --> 335.84000000000003
i'm kind of looking forward to it

334.639 --> 338.8
actually

335.84 --> 339.67999999999995
gonna be pretty exciting

338.8 --> 343.12
because

339.68 --> 345.6
yeah just like previous situations we're

343.12 --> 345.6
going to win

346.8 --> 352.40000000000003
but it's a very interesting time to be

349.6 --> 354.72
able to study people

352.4 --> 357.35999999999996
that are addicted to the ether

354.72 --> 357.36
aberration

359.12 --> 361.44
right

363.759 --> 369.36
and just how that works how the mind

366.319 --> 369.36
works in order to

369.759 --> 372.24
do that

375.84 --> 382.88
what ethereans are

378.479 --> 382.88
right ethereans are people that are

384.319 --> 386.88
yeah

385.199 --> 391.199
that believe

386.88 --> 393.84
that ether exists that it has to exist

391.199 --> 396.319
so i just call it ethereans i yeah gave

393.84 --> 399.19899999999996
it an erwinian name

396.319 --> 399.199
a designation

401.199 --> 405.28000000000003
so

402.96 --> 407.12
look there's people out there that kind

405.28 --> 409.44
of like oh yeah ether right that's

407.12 --> 411.759
supposed to be this and that right

409.44 --> 414.56
scientists physicists

411.759 --> 416.24
they're not necessarily ethereans

414.56 --> 418.639
you're an etherean

416.24 --> 420.319
when you're like religious about it so

418.639 --> 423.039
an etherean

420.319 --> 426.16
concerning ether is what anti-flat

423.039 --> 429.12
earthers are in relation to the globe

426.16 --> 430.0
the fanatics that insist

429.12 --> 433.479
right

430.0 --> 433.479
that's the difference

438.319 --> 442.47900000000004
yeah don't worry about this failing yes

440.96 --> 443.44
i guess

442.479 --> 445.35999999999996
what

443.44 --> 447.84
yuck

445.36 --> 447.84000000000003
i don't know

448.0 --> 452.479
i

449.12 --> 452.479
probably guess

453.84 --> 459.599
i don't know i don't drink any of those

456.479 --> 459.599
brands ever

460.8 --> 466.0
and yeah especially light

463.36 --> 467.84000000000003
products of pretty much any sort i tend

466.0 --> 470.319
to avoid

467.84 --> 472.56
at all costs

470.319 --> 472.56
so

475.759 --> 480.879
right

476.96 --> 480.87899999999996
hello pjc net good to see you

491.599 --> 497.12
but that was pretty cool i thought

494.96 --> 499.12
with owen benjamin

497.12 --> 501.44
just

499.12 --> 503.36
it's so weird from like this fractal

501.44 --> 506.96
perspective like

503.36 --> 509.12
did he actually watch me

506.96 --> 510.71999999999997
right did he actually do that and then

509.12 --> 513.36
just like oh yeah that's actually a

510.72 --> 515.839
really good item to make a piece about

513.36 --> 518.5600000000001
well if he did i'm like yeah dude dude

515.839 --> 520.399
go for it man i'm all about the big bear

518.56 --> 522.159
well not all about it

520.399 --> 524.0
i mean you have your own way of doing

522.159 --> 525.04
things that i don't like to do in that

524.0 --> 526.8
way

525.04 --> 529.1999999999999
and i'm sure that's mutual about a whole

526.8 --> 531.1999999999999
bunch of things

529.2 --> 534.32
but i always like to see the big bear

531.2 --> 536.0
going at where he's good at it and this

534.32 --> 538.1600000000001
is one of those things you know i just

536.0 --> 540.8
make spar i made sparringly mention i

538.16 --> 543.04
basically put down a raw scenario like

540.8 --> 544.64
look at it like this

543.04 --> 546.16
that's what i typically like to do out

544.64 --> 548.88
of nowhere

546.16 --> 550.0
he really made it just a kind of funny

548.88 --> 552.16
and

550.0 --> 554.08
more highlighted the craziness of that

552.16 --> 555.92
whole situation

554.08 --> 558.72
sketch from it

555.92 --> 559.68
and i like that

558.72 --> 560.64
right

559.68 --> 563.8389999999999
even

560.64 --> 567.8389999999999
if he did saw my video and

563.839 --> 569.839
doesn't make mention like okay fine

567.839 --> 572.72
would be kind of weird

569.839 --> 572.72
might ruin it

572.959 --> 576.959
i don't know

574.72 --> 578.1600000000001
i'm just happy

576.959 --> 579.8389999999999
you know yeah

578.16 --> 581.92
am i happy i don't know it's a

579.839 --> 584.48
synchronicity it's kind of weird you

581.92 --> 585.5999999999999
know it's like happy but am i happy i

584.48 --> 588.16
don't know

585.6 --> 588.88
but i'm i'm choosing to be happy about

588.16 --> 592.0799999999999
it

588.88 --> 592.08
okay there you go

602.959 --> 608.16
right also yesterday's show flat earth

605.12 --> 610.16
debate after show very long

608.16 --> 612.48
nathan was hard at it

610.16 --> 613.4399999999999
i was a bit rumpacy

612.48 --> 616.72
but it

613.44 --> 620.1600000000001
i did really try to like give like quick

616.72 --> 622.48
backup support words the right words

620.16 --> 624.7199999999999
and it didn't always hit

622.48 --> 628.48
but yeah it didn't either

624.72 --> 630.72
nathan only shouted once at me and i did

628.48 --> 633.279
i did deserve that

630.72 --> 635.519
but yeah i think nathan has actually

633.279 --> 639.12
like

635.519 --> 639.12
heard my grievances

641.44 --> 647.2790000000001
so i'm liking that

643.839 --> 648.6400000000001
also a moment with tenth man why yeah

647.279 --> 650.8
interrupted him

648.64 --> 653.12
and then apologized and it all went

650.8 --> 653.12
great

654.56 --> 659.3599999999999
so in a way

656.959 --> 660.8
it was like

659.36 --> 662.88
there was energy in the air but it

660.8 --> 664.8
wasn't super rowdy

662.88 --> 666.88
we were all very compulsive but we

664.8 --> 668.24
weren't like

666.88 --> 669.12
deafened

668.24 --> 671.2
from

669.12 --> 672.88
from the input which is what makes you

671.2 --> 675.519
rowdy

672.88 --> 677.68
or you just want to push forth your own

675.519 --> 679.6
point and not really listen anymore that

677.68 --> 681.3599999999999
wasn't happening so yeah yesterday it

679.6 --> 682.48
was a great show can't wait to hear it

681.36 --> 684.64
back

682.48 --> 686.0
it was very funny moment still very

684.64 --> 688.64
funny

686.0 --> 691.36
kiwi was in there and he wasn't just

688.64 --> 694.959
yelling all the time so that's always

691.36 --> 694.9590000000001
like a miracle on his own

701.279 --> 707.12
main show was fiery enough yeah yeah

705.44 --> 708.9590000000001
yeah at the end that's what it started

707.12 --> 711.2
well that pretty much went on for an

708.959 --> 713.5189999999999
hour straight

711.2 --> 716.399
serious

713.519 --> 719.2
like multiple guys stepped in like i

716.399 --> 722.56
think like up to three guys were trying

719.2 --> 722.5600000000001
to defend the ether in this

737.12 --> 741.48
let's see what else is going on

746.24 --> 748.5600000000001
hmm

752.0 --> 756.0
ah i missed i missed a whole bunch of

754.079 --> 759.56
streams why did i miss those streams

756.0 --> 759.56
what was i doing

760.48 --> 763.6
that's so weird

767.04 --> 770.079
sometimes there's just gaps

769.12 --> 771.519
i'm like

770.079 --> 773.3599999999999
looking back and i'm like why didn't i

771.519 --> 774.5600000000001
watch that why didn't i even notice that

773.36 --> 776.72
before

774.56 --> 778.7199999999999
like what was i doing

776.72 --> 781.6800000000001
in order not to notice that

778.72 --> 781.6800000000001
specifically like

782.399 --> 786.639
sometimes it's like really weird trying

784.56 --> 788.16
to remember what i actually do in the

786.639 --> 790.88
evening

788.16 --> 796.36
like after

790.88 --> 796.36
letter debate after show after talk ends

801.36 --> 806.399
it's like the order of things just kind

804.0 --> 808.0
of tend to get jumbled i think i was

806.399 --> 809.68
like

808.0 --> 814.12
mostly just playing

809.68 --> 814.12
civilization five and

814.639 --> 820.04
watching i was watching something but

817.04 --> 820.04
what

838.639 --> 844.16
like my

840.24 --> 849.199
shorter memory it's not unstable it just

844.16 --> 849.199
has very odd patterns to me it's like

849.76 --> 852.72
yeah

850.639 --> 855.36
because this happens

852.72 --> 856.399
i think like every day pretty much it's

855.36 --> 857.92
just like

856.399 --> 859.68
always parts where i have so much

857.92 --> 861.36
trouble just trying to remember exactly

859.68 --> 863.5999999999999
what happened but then as soon as i get

861.36 --> 867.9590000000001
in the flow

863.6 --> 867.9590000000001
it just all falls into place

871.199 --> 876.24
you should know dolores what the [ __ ]

873.36 --> 876.24
are you talking about

877.519 --> 881.839
i've already shared my grievances and he

879.92 --> 885.8389999999999
was great yesterday he was not

881.839 --> 885.839
disrespectful at all

889.519 --> 893.68
i only retain the information i need

895.519 --> 901.68
that that that is a logical conclusion

898.399 --> 901.68
in raw it's just that

908.8 --> 915.04
i'm sometimes surprised by

911.519 --> 917.519
how i actually assimilate information in

915.04 --> 920.079
different points in time

917.519 --> 922.32
because a lot of the time when i wake up

920.079 --> 924.3199999999999
pretty early and don't feel like kind of

922.32 --> 928.1600000000001
sick-ish or something which can

924.32 --> 930.8000000000001
typically happen when i wake up early

928.16 --> 935.04
then i just go watch videos and i like

930.8 --> 935.04
they really stick to memory then

935.12 --> 940.0
but like in the evening

937.839 --> 942.639
it doesn't really stick all that much to

940.0 --> 942.639
the memory

945.04 --> 953.0
unless it's something like

948.16 --> 953.0
transcendental like really significant

968.8 --> 974.16
because i do also like watch info wars

971.04 --> 974.16
often in the background

977.12 --> 981.68
and sometimes it makes me want to throw

979.12 --> 984.0
up and the other times it's like oh wait

981.68 --> 985.279
that's actually kind of interesting

984.0 --> 988.72
so

985.279 --> 988.72
oh yeah now i remember

989.36 --> 994.399
that was kind of fascinating

992.959 --> 997.5999999999999
i mean

994.399 --> 998.8
i had a really interesting

997.6 --> 1001.519
yeah

998.8 --> 1001.519
this lady

1001.759 --> 1007.519
that got on

1004.0 --> 1007.519
with alex jones

1007.759 --> 1012.0790000000001
she's been on many times

1009.6 --> 1014.32
it's like she's a doctor of some kind

1012.079 --> 1017.4399999999999
one of those but a really interesting

1014.32 --> 1019.12
one that's stupid to forget the name

1017.44 --> 1021.36
and i don't forget the face and like

1019.12 --> 1024.24
their distinct way of how she uses her

1021.36 --> 1026.4
voice

1024.24 --> 1029.1200000000001
and like

1026.4 --> 1032.4
i just had a whole

1029.12 --> 1034.7199999999998
interface moment she was sharing so much

1032.4 --> 1038.0
internal esoteric data

1034.72 --> 1040.079
it was really fascinating and she went

1038.0 --> 1041.839
she went there

1040.079 --> 1044.24
she was like

1041.839 --> 1046.079
like there needs to be a medical

1044.24 --> 1049.1200000000001
revolution where we just completely

1046.079 --> 1051.44
discard these disproven concepts

1049.12 --> 1053.84
including viruses like she went there

1051.44 --> 1056.0800000000002
like she didn't name it but it's like

1053.84 --> 1057.76
almost going german new medicine and

1056.08 --> 1060.559
just to have

1057.76 --> 1063.12
somebody that open about it on the alex

1060.559 --> 1064.0
jones show

1063.12 --> 1068.559
yeah

1064.0 --> 1068.559
that was kind of baffling fascinating

1069.679 --> 1072.88
what the hell is there

1075.679 --> 1082.4
i'm sure there's all kinds of weirdness

1080.24 --> 1082.4
her

1090.799 --> 1094.84
i hope they left an article

1095.2 --> 1099.6000000000001
they might have just not left an article

1106.84 --> 1110.1599999999999
ah nope

1110.32 --> 1114.0
i can't find an article about it

1114.799 --> 1117.679
hey good servant

1118.16 --> 1122.039
seen agm yeah

1122.64 --> 1128.4
he seems to be just doing other stuff

1124.559 --> 1128.3999999999999
now hanging around other places

1128.48 --> 1134.32
i think agm is like hanging around uh

1132.0 --> 1136.559
it's his name again

1134.32 --> 1138.8799999999999
bev's

1136.559 --> 1141.76
i think that's his new group and it's

1138.88 --> 1144.72
that is like yeah

1141.76 --> 1147.039
more closely to his type of frequency i

1144.72 --> 1149.3600000000001
don't know if it's good for him because

1147.039 --> 1152.96
it's a lot of safari mode

1149.36 --> 1152.9599999999998
but i think he's hanging around there

1161.28 --> 1166.72
right but hey good serving everybody or

1163.919 --> 1170.0
almost everybody just they go through

1166.72 --> 1172.0
phases they learn stuff and then they

1170.0 --> 1173.919
migrate they spiritually migrate they

1172.0 --> 1176.16
kind of lose interest it's happened a

1173.919 --> 1179.039
lot

1176.16 --> 1180.88
so every time i see somebody back

1179.039 --> 1182.96
from like years ago that have followed

1180.88 --> 1185.7600000000002
me my show back then and to just see

1182.96 --> 1188.08
them back that's always like wow

1185.76 --> 1191.12
an old friend

1188.08 --> 1195.6789999999999
because they just go away

1191.12 --> 1195.6789999999999
and yeah don't necessarily blame them

1197.2 --> 1200.32
i mean at some point

1200.72 --> 1207.2
you might get just sick of my intensity

1204.159 --> 1209.8400000000001
of how intense i tend to be

1207.2 --> 1211.76
because i also get like that even when

1209.84 --> 1213.52
it is extremely inconvenient and when

1211.76 --> 1215.28
you're like come on or when you really

1213.52 --> 1217.44
have to go there again

1215.28 --> 1219.84
right and then yeah you should be kind

1217.44 --> 1222.159
of sick of it in such a moment if you're

1219.84 --> 1225.12
like if you have a good stable flow for

1222.159 --> 1227.3600000000001
yourself going and it's just like okay

1225.12 --> 1228.8799999999999
just disconnect

1227.36 --> 1232.52
totally get it

1228.88 --> 1232.5200000000002
try again later

1234.559 --> 1238.0
right

1235.679 --> 1240.48
and sometimes things have happened

1238.0 --> 1242.72
between us or like

1240.48 --> 1245.2
for example how i treated foreign

1242.72 --> 1246.64
yesterday and that's the second time by

1245.2 --> 1249.52
the way that this has happened that he

1246.64 --> 1251.6000000000001
just pushed that until i kicked him

1249.52 --> 1255.76
where they just

1251.6 --> 1255.76
end up taking it very personal

1256.32 --> 1262.24
and that's a mistake that's an accident

1260.08 --> 1264.1589999999999
because it is about the moment it's

1262.24 --> 1266.48
about the attitude in the moment about

1264.159 --> 1268.3200000000002
controlling your instincts your social

1266.48 --> 1270.799
instincts in the moment

1268.32 --> 1273.039
do not squirt

1270.799 --> 1273.039
right

1273.28 --> 1277.36
this is not a face-to-face situation

1275.44 --> 1279.6000000000001
where i'm trying to dominate you like a

1277.36 --> 1281.84
hooker or something like tate

1279.6 --> 1284.7199999999998
that's not what that is or what i'm

1281.84 --> 1286.3999999999999
trying to do this is about order and

1284.72 --> 1288.32
about well

1286.4 --> 1291.52
sovereignty of the situation i am the

1288.32 --> 1293.6789999999999
channel owner i am the one with

1291.52 --> 1295.44
verbal capacity here

1293.679 --> 1297.3600000000001
that's how it works

1295.44 --> 1300.159
and

1297.36 --> 1302.1589999999999
everything else is secondary

1300.159 --> 1304.0
when it comes to hierarchical order and

1302.159 --> 1306.0
that's what that really is about about

1304.0 --> 1308.4
the order in the moment and it's not

1306.0 --> 1310.159
personal but some people do still then

1308.4 --> 1312.5590000000002
take it personal

1310.159 --> 1315.679
and then he hold the grudge

1312.559 --> 1318.24
agm was very much about that too had a

1315.679 --> 1321.039
lot of trouble at times when he just

1318.24 --> 1322.72
like uh but you know you did do that to

1321.039 --> 1324.64
me like that

1322.72 --> 1326.88
just can't help it

1324.64 --> 1328.64
the last time i saw him though he seemed

1326.88 --> 1331.0390000000002
to have like

1328.64 --> 1335.5200000000002
strengthened it

1331.039 --> 1335.52
he doesn't do that with me anymore

1336.159 --> 1341.679
so i think he's really

1338.72 --> 1344.64
he really has engaged in like learning

1341.679 --> 1348.72
to tame it to get control over that and

1344.64 --> 1348.72
that's great that's fantastic

1349.6 --> 1354.9599999999998
right

1351.6 --> 1354.9599999999998
it's part of why i do this

1355.76 --> 1360.8799999999999
because those types of behavior are

1357.919 --> 1363.2
gonna out there

1360.88 --> 1364.88
in the world in the wild world where a

1363.2 --> 1367.8400000000001
lot of people are completely

1364.88 --> 1367.8400000000001
untrustworthy

1368.4 --> 1370.88
people

1369.36 --> 1372.8799999999999
abuse

1370.88 --> 1374.7990000000002
those traits

1372.88 --> 1378.24
and that's why you need to

1374.799 --> 1380.96
master them and get them under control

1378.24 --> 1383.919
or it might end up bad for you i mean

1380.96 --> 1384.88
i'm pretty sure out there

1383.919 --> 1387.76
like

1384.88 --> 1389.679
it's gone as far as that a percentage of

1387.76 --> 1391.2
people probably

1389.679 --> 1393.6000000000001
got faxed

1391.2 --> 1395.6000000000001
because of their gamma impulses that

1393.6 --> 1398.8799999999999
they couldn't get in under control and

1395.6 --> 1402.28
then somebody basically

1398.88 --> 1402.2800000000002
tricked them

1403.679 --> 1409.039
appeal to those traits

1406.4 --> 1410.4
in order to motivate somebody to go

1409.039 --> 1412.64
there

1410.4 --> 1412.64
and

1414.08 --> 1418.72
take it all very serious

1416.4 --> 1418.72
anyway

1423.12 --> 1429.6399999999999
right but hey ejem is still around he's

1425.76 --> 1429.64
just hanging around bev's

1436.32 --> 1440.96
you know that i'm actually like really

1438.08 --> 1443.279
disappointed about voynich

1440.96 --> 1445.52
because voynich has

1443.279 --> 1447.919
interesting knowledge

1445.52 --> 1448.8799999999999
he's dug in places where most people

1447.919 --> 1452.159
just

1448.88 --> 1454.88
can't find that

1452.159 --> 1457.1200000000001
but he just cannot he doesn't have

1454.88 --> 1460.159
control over the savonia complex and

1457.12 --> 1464.4799999999998
that can make him potentially dangerous

1460.159 --> 1464.48
in it in an unpredictable bad way

1466.0 --> 1468.64
it's

1466.799 --> 1471.2
ethereal then don't pay too much

1468.64 --> 1473.279
attention to that

1471.2 --> 1476.0
i just really wish

1473.279 --> 1477.2
after those years he would have

1476.0 --> 1478.799
gotten it

1477.2 --> 1481.279
he didn't

1478.799 --> 1483.52
although look if i unbanned him today

1481.279 --> 1484.559
and i haven't yet

1483.52 --> 1486.6399999999999
then

1484.559 --> 1488.72
he might just turn around again so i

1486.64 --> 1492.0800000000002
will probably unban

1488.72 --> 1492.08
him somewhere this week

1496.799 --> 1500.8799999999999
by the way there's still just people out

1498.64 --> 1502.72
there do just say hey

1500.88 --> 1505.679
why don't you unban me and then i

1502.72 --> 1507.3600000000001
literally look for them

1505.679 --> 1512.2
in my band list and they're just not

1507.36 --> 1512.1999999999998
there like you're not banned

1536.64 --> 1540.8400000000001
yep get out of here

1545.919 --> 1549.1200000000001
that's a bot

1554.64 --> 1558.88
he did an apology video who did

1562.559 --> 1567.3999999999999
what what are you talking about good

1564.4 --> 1567.4
servant

1571.52 --> 1574.6399999999999
voynich really

1576.72 --> 1578.96
huh

1579.679 --> 1584.72
i

1581.12 --> 1585.9189999999999
i did not even realize he had channel

1584.72 --> 1590.159
activity

1585.919 --> 1590.159
wow we did actual apology video

1590.799 --> 1597.08
okay

1593.12 --> 1597.08
i hadn't expected that

1612.08 --> 1615.12
where where is it

1624.96 --> 1628.32
i'm not subscribed to him

1632.96 --> 1636.72
oh goody

1634.4 --> 1638.0800000000002
uh do you have a channel link or

1636.72 --> 1641.3600000000001
anything

1638.08 --> 1644.6399999999999
because i guess the word voyage is kind

1641.36 --> 1644.6399999999999
of universal

1646.159 --> 1649.679
i'm not finding his channel

1651.2 --> 1654.919
can you post that

1659.679 --> 1665.3990000000001
ah

1661.12 --> 1665.399
that was quick thank you pgcnet

1676.159 --> 1683.8400000000001
triggered our win again okay that's

1680.0 --> 1683.84
42 minutes jesus

1684.159 --> 1686.3990000000001
uh

1687.919 --> 1692.5200000000002
are you sure that's an apology video

1706.0 --> 1710.76
yes yes he was susie s

1714.96 --> 1719.039
looks like it but did you actually

1717.2 --> 1721.919
listen i mean yes

1719.039 --> 1725.679
there is a sorry arwen in the title that

1721.919 --> 1729.919
does not it's a 42 minute video dude

1725.679 --> 1732.5590000000002
also yeah when you say triggered arwin

1729.919 --> 1736.88
that's not a very good

1732.559 --> 1739.84
uh thing to precede sorry irwin with so

1736.88 --> 1743.7600000000002
i'm i'm not sure by just first glance

1739.84 --> 1746.24
that this is actually an apology video

1743.76 --> 1750.52
i appreciate you

1746.24 --> 1750.52
informing me about it though

1752.24 --> 1756.96
i guess i'll take a peek

1755.279 --> 1760.44
i mean this could also be him just

1756.96 --> 1760.44
doubling down

1777.84 --> 1782.84
yeah it seems like a commentary video

1794.399 --> 1798.399
it is kind of hilarious though

1799.039 --> 1802.8799999999999
all these

1800.32 --> 1804.32
comments of people that are obviously

1802.88 --> 1806.7990000000002
like

1804.32 --> 1808.6399999999999
not a big fan

1806.799 --> 1811.76
there's some people that are noticing

1808.64 --> 1814.0800000000002
that i do kind of project at times when

1811.76 --> 1816.72
i get angry

1814.08 --> 1818.96
i have to say that that is absolutely

1816.72 --> 1818.96
true

1819.279 --> 1822.6
it's unavoidable

1828.399 --> 1833.36
that doesn't make what i'm gonna say

1830.799 --> 1834.72
when i'm angry untrue

1833.36 --> 1838.08
it's just that

1834.72 --> 1839.84
yeah i might just get a little bit extra

1838.08 --> 1841.52
angry about it

1839.84 --> 1844.24
if i know

1841.52 --> 1846.32
that i might be

1844.24 --> 1848.88
making a mistake in a certain way too

1846.32 --> 1851.84
but then i have to prioritize managing

1848.88 --> 1851.8400000000001
the hangout

1852.159 --> 1855.5200000000002
keeping it under control

1856.24 --> 1861.2
but yeah it does happen sometimes that i

1859.2 --> 1863.8400000000001
just end up projecting and sometimes

1861.2 --> 1866.88
even as i'm projecting i do also see

1863.84 --> 1868.32
kind of the comedy of that

1866.88 --> 1870.24
right because just because i'm

1868.32 --> 1872.48
projecting and it also applies to me

1870.24 --> 1874.24
that doesn't necessarily mean that what

1872.48 --> 1876.3990000000001
i'm saying is incorrect and that it

1874.24 --> 1877.919
doesn't apply to the target

1876.399 --> 1881.12
you see

1877.919 --> 1883.279
it's it's just little fractal sprinkles

1881.12 --> 1883.279
it's

1884.159 --> 1890.64
it's what part of the the trick

1887.76 --> 1893.64
of the arwanian method

1890.64 --> 1893.64
is

1893.919 --> 1898.3200000000002
i mean it's very therapeutical actually

1899.279 --> 1905.159
right

1900.96 --> 1905.159
and i mean i don't go like

1906.08 --> 1912.559
and then constantly like cut

1909.279 --> 1915.12
things that should not be cut

1912.559 --> 1918.559
it's just i get a little like a japanese

1915.12 --> 1918.559
cook i get just really

1919.84 --> 1923.76
straight to the point and aesthetic

1922.08 --> 1926.08
about it

1923.76 --> 1926.08
quick

1926.399 --> 1929.399
anyway

1935.519 --> 1937.76
okay

1938.48 --> 1942.08
hello carlos

1940.64 --> 1944.96
the goods

1942.08 --> 1948.36
clutch good to see you

1944.96 --> 1948.3600000000001
mandy young

1951.039 --> 1956.559
flat sides understanding of perspective

1953.12 --> 1956.559
and angles what about it

1958.159 --> 1962.2
i mean it seems pretty solid

1963.36 --> 1967.12
he's not made any like

1967.36 --> 1971.76
reification mistakes

1969.84 --> 1973.76
that i've picked up on and sometimes he

1971.76 --> 1974.48
does a little but then he also corrects

1973.76 --> 1977.2
that

1974.48 --> 1979.84
since he figures it out so

1977.2 --> 1982.24
i mean flat sides video seem pretty

1979.84 --> 1982.24
decent

1985.84 --> 1991.4399999999998
i mean he is no like dry mathematician

1988.96 --> 1992.88
type like brian

1991.44 --> 1995.76
who's much

1992.88 --> 1998.64
who is more on point with that

1995.76 --> 2001.679
but it's also much drier like that

1998.64 --> 2004.7990000000002
but yeah flat swords videos are fine

2001.679 --> 2008.0
but yeah his hangouts i

2004.799 --> 2010.8799999999999
to say i'm not really watching those

2008.0 --> 2010.88
nothing personal

2011.679 --> 2018.679
it's just that the timing is not great

2015.679 --> 2018.679
and

2020.24 --> 2026.72
he's basically and he is like

2024.0 --> 2028.399
inviting flat earth talking about yeah

2026.72 --> 2030.88
he's going up against ballers and it's

2028.399 --> 2032.559
just like

2030.88 --> 2034.72
i don't know i still have to get used to

2032.559 --> 2036.799
it i mean he hasn't really done any live

2034.72 --> 2039.3600000000001
streams before i still have to like get

2036.799 --> 2041.2
a feel of like what it actually is that

2039.36 --> 2042.24
he does

2041.2 --> 2044.159
so

2042.24 --> 2047.72
i'm still kind of being a cat in the

2044.159 --> 2047.72
tree at the moment

2048.0 --> 2050.399
so but

2050.96 --> 2056.359
i'll eventually come down

2053.359 --> 2056.359
right

2061.76 --> 2067.3590000000004
it might also be the accent

2064.72 --> 2070.1589999999997
i think that the accent for too long a

2067.359 --> 2072.7999999999997
time is kind of annoying

2070.159 --> 2073.76
that you might feel the opposite about

2072.8 --> 2076.159
that

2073.76 --> 2078.2400000000002
i think it's a bit just like

2076.159 --> 2080.48
it's fine but just to hear that

2078.24 --> 2082.7999999999997
specifically for like an hour and then

2080.48 --> 2082.8
i'm like

2083.839 --> 2086.839
no

2094.24 --> 2098.72
it sounds really weird but i'd rather be

2096.48 --> 2103.839
listening to the sound of my own voice

2098.72 --> 2103.839
for two hours instead really

2111.44 --> 2117.839
it yes south south african

2115.52 --> 2117.839
accent

2118.079 --> 2120.4
right

2120.48 --> 2124.079
but it's

2121.68 --> 2125.7599999999998
it's like really disruptive

2124.079 --> 2128.4
because he

2125.76 --> 2130.48
he really does have an accent and then

2128.4 --> 2132.48
when you get technical

2130.48 --> 2134.079
it's just like

2132.48 --> 2136.72
he's just talking and then it's like the

2134.079 --> 2141.44
words just keep shaking

2136.72 --> 2141.4399999999996
vowel weirdo rotations and like ah

2142.0 --> 2146.48
it just gives me a headache it's like

2144.32 --> 2150.7200000000003
he's not the type of accent i would want

2146.48 --> 2150.72
to listen to for like technical data

2154.88 --> 2159.599
and by the way with brian i have a

2157.2 --> 2163.2
little bit of similar issues but brian

2159.599 --> 2163.2000000000003
is like much more careful

2164.8 --> 2169.04
because he's aware of his irish accent

2167.359 --> 2171.52
and he can like

2169.04 --> 2173.52
turn it off a bit and like turn it back

2171.52 --> 2175.7599999999998
on especially when he gets pissed off

2173.52 --> 2178.7599999999998
then he like puts the irish back right

2175.76 --> 2178.76
on

2188.079 --> 2194.079
why do people call the fire department

2190.56 --> 2195.52
to rescue a cat from a tree

2194.079 --> 2198.2400000000002
well

2195.52 --> 2200.48
it's because of the people

2198.24 --> 2202.3999999999996
it's the people that are worried it's

2200.48 --> 2204.48
the people that want the fire apartment

2202.4 --> 2206.7200000000003
to do that if those people don't do that

2204.48 --> 2208.64
then the cat will eventually be like oh

2206.72 --> 2211.52
oh okay nobody cares anymore okay i'll

2208.64 --> 2211.52
just go down now

2212.64 --> 2218.24
yeah it's because people they're just

2214.8 --> 2222.52
being played by cats

2218.24 --> 2222.52
that are playing on their sentimentality

2224.0 --> 2227.28
and they just get caught up in spell

2226.4 --> 2229.44
they

2227.28 --> 2232.5600000000004
they turn the cat into a little kid or

2229.44 --> 2234.8
something and this happens a lot

2232.56 --> 2234.7999999999997
right

2235.2 --> 2240.0789999999997
you project a little person on it and

2237.599 --> 2244.7200000000003
then not realizing that oh that's a cat

2240.079 --> 2248.2400000000002
the cats are extremely dynamic creatures

2244.72 --> 2248.24
especially when they're still young

2251.52 --> 2254.839
nobody has ever seen a cat skeleton

2253.52 --> 2259.8
industry that's

2254.839 --> 2259.7999999999997
right that would be really bizarre

2275.2 --> 2278.8799999999997
hello on the level chris

2282.48 --> 2288.88
billy tamworth

2284.56 --> 2288.88
huh getting all kinds of new people here

2288.96 --> 2294.8
that aren't just immediately easily

2292.0 --> 2297.8
identifiable as trolls wow

2294.8 --> 2297.8
cool

2302.8 --> 2307.04
i don't know how to calculate anything

2304.8 --> 2307.04
oh

2309.52 --> 2312.839
yeah i do

2317.76 --> 2323.8390000000004
i don't understand math

2320.96 --> 2327.44
yes yeah i do actually understand math

2323.839 --> 2331.04
it's just that the higher scored math

2327.44 --> 2331.04
tends to kind of piss me off

2331.119 --> 2335.92
because

2332.88 --> 2337.839
of what it is actually doing what is

2335.92 --> 2339.6800000000003
being done with the math and then people

2337.839 --> 2343.7599999999998
get stuck to the math instead of

2339.68 --> 2345.9199999999996
realizing you're just reifying stuff

2343.76 --> 2348.2400000000002
i discovered this relatively early on

2345.92 --> 2351.44
even before i figured out that

2348.24 --> 2351.4399999999996
the earth is not a globe

2351.76 --> 2355.599
and

2352.8 --> 2357.6800000000003
it just made me mistrust math so i've

2355.599 --> 2361.92
much more about just recognizing

2357.68 --> 2361.9199999999996
patterns including in math

2363.28 --> 2367.3590000000004
much more

2364.64 --> 2370.7999999999997
about that than actually just mastering

2367.359 --> 2370.7999999999997
trickery with calculus

2373.44 --> 2377.92
i don't even know

2375.04 --> 2377.92
what's gravity

2380.079 --> 2385.3590000000004
god i think we got a definite

2382.96 --> 2387.92
derpcon level two

2385.359 --> 2387.92
over here

2390.32 --> 2394.96
my butt okay

2392.7 --> 2397.839
[Music]

2394.96 --> 2397.839
oh

2402.64 --> 2408.0
don't seem you have

2404.96 --> 2411.0
a lot of depth to your argumentation

2408.0 --> 2411.0
here

2416.4 --> 2424.28
block jaw lady from comey what

2420.48 --> 2424.28
are you talking about

2432.8 --> 2439.1600000000003
i thought it was like sake or something

2436.16 --> 2439.16
whatever

2461.92 --> 2466.319
right i mean guys

2464.72 --> 2469.7599999999998
we're flat earth is right we're on the

2466.319 --> 2469.7599999999998
flat earth early bird show

2470.24 --> 2474.4799999999996
this

2471.2 --> 2474.48
is our competition

2477.52 --> 2484.16
the lady that says you don't understand

2479.92 --> 2486.56
math you don't even know what gravity is

2484.16 --> 2489.5989999999997
and then when i ask what's gravity

2486.56 --> 2494.599
she says your butt

2489.599 --> 2494.599
that's our philosophical opponent

2494.88 --> 2498.88
i mean they're they're they're trying to

2496.96 --> 2500.8
defeat us

2498.88 --> 2503.2000000000003
through boredom

2500.8 --> 2505.04
and gaslighting us that they're so

2503.2 --> 2507.68
incompetent that we can just let our

2505.04 --> 2507.68
guards down

2507.76 --> 2513.5200000000004
i think that's the tactic now because

2510.8 --> 2517.6800000000003
technically philosophically they're so

2513.52 --> 2522.68
utterly defeated they have nowhere to go

2517.68 --> 2522.68
it's all just scraping out bones

2522.88 --> 2527.839
following the skeleton structures

2525.92 --> 2532.48
because there is nothing left for them

2527.839 --> 2535.359
to do because it's all been disproven

2532.48 --> 2536.4
all they have is their tenacity

2535.359 --> 2537.52
and ability

2536.4 --> 2540.88
to

2537.52 --> 2540.88
keep themselves diluted

2544.16 --> 2549.459
it's a tough argument

2546.4 --> 2549.4590000000003
[Music]

2569.04 --> 2571.359
what

2576.4 --> 2582.7200000000003
okay dusty flynn gavel gravel spawn

2580.4 --> 2586.1600000000003
i recognize that name that's a really

2582.72 --> 2586.16
weird thing to say there

2589.52 --> 2595.359
i mean a world that would be vertically

2592.56 --> 2595.359
oriented

2595.44 --> 2600.4
sounds like a a giant

2598.48 --> 2601.92
wall

2600.4 --> 2604.56
i mean

2601.92 --> 2605.52
maybe in a world of seagulls yeah but no

2604.56 --> 2608.16
like

2605.52 --> 2610.64
there's no water

2608.16 --> 2612.72
i mean even with birds on the wall it

2610.64 --> 2614.64
works because there's usually an ocean

2612.72 --> 2616.48
somewhere right because there's

2614.64 --> 2618.0
combination of 90 degree angles if

2616.48 --> 2623.079
everything is vertical

2618.0 --> 2623.079
ah why am i entertaining this [ __ ]

2643.119 --> 2648.04
okay

2644.24 --> 2648.04
negative ionized

2648.4 --> 2650.96
gasps

2651.2 --> 2656.0789999999997
gives it weight so no that isn't gravity

2655.119 --> 2658.079
that's

2656.079 --> 2660.2400000000002
effectively what you described there

2658.079 --> 2663.52
carlos just carlos

2660.24 --> 2665.2799999999997
but you effectively described there

2663.52 --> 2668.319
is enhancing

2665.28 --> 2670.5600000000004
the density through negative ionization

2668.319 --> 2672.88
well if air becomes dense

2670.56 --> 2674.24
then on average it will spread out in

2672.88 --> 2678.2400000000002
all directions

2674.24 --> 2681.04
with a slight bias downward because

2678.24 --> 2684.0789999999997
it is now denser than the rest of the

2681.04 --> 2687.2799999999997
air that surrounds it

2684.079 --> 2687.28
it's not because of weight

2687.359 --> 2690.88
it's not go down go boom boom because of

2689.68 --> 2693.68
weight

2690.88 --> 2696.079
it is just a little denser so it's gonna

2693.68 --> 2699.9199999999996
spread out in all directions within the

2696.079 --> 2702.079
availability of the container

2699.92 --> 2704.64
and because as it is spreading out in

2702.079 --> 2707.28
all directions it is still denser than

2704.64 --> 2711.2799999999997
the average medium it is present in it's

2707.28 --> 2711.28
gonna buy us slightly downward

2716.079 --> 2722.4
until eventually it just completely is

2718.64 --> 2724.8799999999997
mixed up and becomes inhomogeneous so

2722.4 --> 2724.88
don't know

2725.92 --> 2729.04
what you're up about

2730.839 --> 2737.04
this ionizing giving gas weight

2735.28 --> 2739.0400000000004
like that also the way you said it's

2737.04 --> 2740.96
like they suddenly gained weight where

2739.04 --> 2743.2799999999997
before they had none now they've been

2740.96 --> 2746.0
invoked with weight it's just you ionize

2743.28 --> 2748.48
and now it has weight where before there

2746.0 --> 2749.76
was no weight

2748.48 --> 2752.16
hmm

2749.76 --> 2752.1600000000003
weird

2755.359 --> 2758.319
you don't know what weight was until you

2757.2 --> 2761.68
skipped

2758.319 --> 2765.359
on the bathroom scales

2761.68 --> 2768.72
well i know what weight is weight is

2765.359 --> 2771.359
uh a system a convention

2768.72 --> 2774.64
anchored on relative density

2771.359 --> 2775.839
disequilibrium force

2774.64 --> 2777.7599999999998
right

2775.839 --> 2779.119
in relation

2777.76 --> 2783.3590000000004
to

2779.119 --> 2783.359
an air medium at ground level

2783.52 --> 2786.96
that's what it's based on it's a

2784.96 --> 2789.28
convention weight is a relative density

2786.96 --> 2791.28
this equilibrium force

2789.28 --> 2794.1600000000003
anchor point convention in a very

2791.28 --> 2796.7200000000003
specific setup

2794.16 --> 2798.56
so that you can then

2796.72 --> 2799.68
because of the anchoring then you can

2798.56 --> 2802.0
certainly

2799.68 --> 2805.52
put it into a numerical system then you

2802.0 --> 2807.599
can have like a measurable weight all of

2805.52 --> 2809.52
a sudden

2807.599 --> 2810.2400000000002
because you anchored

2809.52 --> 2812.48
the

2810.24 --> 2813.7599999999998
the way to determine that weight which

2812.48 --> 2817.839
is

2813.76 --> 2817.8390000000004
in a medium of air at ground level

2824.64 --> 2831.839
right because actual weight is

2828.96 --> 2831.839
two

2837.119 --> 2843.28
actual weight is a convention based on

2840.16 --> 2844.5589999999997
the presupposition of gravity

2843.28 --> 2847.6800000000003
it might

2844.559 --> 2850.4
mathematically work out just fine

2847.68 --> 2852.319
sure it will most cases except with the

2850.4 --> 2854.319
helium balloon and except like when

2852.319 --> 2856.4
you're in a medium of water and then you

2854.319 --> 2857.92
have water weight oh wait now it's

2856.4 --> 2860.4
called water weight and then you have a

2857.92 --> 2862.48
vacuum weight

2860.4 --> 2866.64
yeah that's why weight

2862.48 --> 2870.0
in reality is just air weight it's

2866.64 --> 2872.72
weight in air at ground level

2870.0 --> 2874.24
that's weights they just shorted it

2872.72 --> 2875.9199999999996
well why would you have those other

2874.24 --> 2878.64
weights because they're different

2875.92 --> 2881.359
because it's not actually a unified

2878.64 --> 2883.839
force pulling everything down

2881.359 --> 2886.64
like the newtonian model to which he

2883.839 --> 2890.88
himself officially in a letter

2886.64 --> 2894.64
heavily disclaimed the hypothesis

2890.88 --> 2894.6400000000003
yeah newton disclaimed that

2895.44 --> 2899.2000000000003
he didn't want to have anything to do

2896.96 --> 2900.7200000000003
with it it's just a model and it doesn't

2899.2 --> 2903.2
work

2900.72 --> 2905.5989999999997
because the real situation and i don't

2903.2 --> 2907.359
know maybe newton even realized this at

2905.599 --> 2908.8
this point they just never really got to

2907.359 --> 2911.359
work on it

2908.8 --> 2913.52
maybe it was scrubbed afterward because

2911.359 --> 2915.52
they insisted on using his gravity model

2913.52 --> 2917.28
against his will

2915.52 --> 2919.119
but he could have known even about

2917.28 --> 2921.0400000000004
relative density

2919.119 --> 2922.8
that it's all about that the relation

2921.04 --> 2926.24
between the density of an object and the

2922.8 --> 2927.76
density of the medium will determine

2926.24 --> 2930.8799999999997
the direction

2927.76 --> 2935.28
and the amount of force

2930.88 --> 2935.28
that the object will be subjected to

2938.079 --> 2941.04
pressure

2939.04 --> 2943.44
force

2941.04 --> 2945.839
yeah it can be pressure

2943.44 --> 2948.48
but is also just displacement good

2945.839 --> 2951.04
servant i mean an object

2948.48 --> 2953.599
when it can no longer move in the

2951.04 --> 2956.079
direction that this equilibrium force

2953.599 --> 2958.7200000000003
wants it to go then instead it will

2956.079 --> 2958.7200000000003
translate

2958.8 --> 2962.0
into

2959.76 --> 2964.2400000000002
pressure

2962.0 --> 2966.88
right it's displacement if there's free

2964.24 --> 2969.4399999999996
mobility for an object and if not then

2966.88 --> 2970.7200000000003
it will exert pressure in the in the

2969.44 --> 2972.079
direction

2970.72 --> 2975.68
that the relative density this

2972.079 --> 2979.319
equilibrium force is forcing it into

2975.68 --> 2979.319
that's how it works

2986.16 --> 2989.7599999999998
what's the word isn't there a shorter

2987.92 --> 2992.0
way

2989.76 --> 2992.0
nope

2994.16 --> 2999.2799999999997
but you don't have to say all these

2997.2 --> 3001.52
things every single time look if you

2999.28 --> 3004.0
just want to like get it over with and

3001.52 --> 3007.04
just use math

3004.0 --> 3009.76
easy then fine just use gravity i mean

3007.04 --> 3011.359
it's only a model it's a tool i'm fine

3009.76 --> 3013.5200000000004
with using it

3011.359 --> 3016.7999999999997
i mean i wouldn't want to force

3013.52 --> 3019.119
everybody to start using an elaborate

3016.8 --> 3021.76
relative density system

3019.119 --> 3025.2000000000003
with everything they do when gravity

3021.76 --> 3027.599
would work just well enough

3025.2 --> 3030.16
but if you want to really stick to

3027.599 --> 3033.04
physics and what's really happening

3030.16 --> 3035.44
then gravity will not suffice

3033.04 --> 3037.44
then it's only a model then you need

3035.44 --> 3040.0
when you need to get real

3037.44 --> 3040.96
which is physics right that is getting

3040.0 --> 3043.28
real

3040.96 --> 3045.839
can't just like get conceptions in there

3043.28 --> 3048.3190000000004
and assume they're real

3045.839 --> 3051.599
and then relative density

3048.319 --> 3052.48
is the only system that actually follows

3051.599 --> 3054.559
through

3052.48 --> 3056.96
every step of the way

3054.559 --> 3059.119
it's the only thing that always works

3056.96 --> 3063.2
always under every circumstance every

3059.119 --> 3063.2000000000003
conceivable setup it will work

3063.839 --> 3068.24
when there is no force yes there is

3066.88 --> 3070.0
there there's relative density this

3068.24 --> 3072.0789999999997
equilibrium force

3070.0 --> 3072.88
if an object

3072.079 --> 3076.1600000000003
is

3072.88 --> 3078.48
denser or less dense than the medium it

3076.16 --> 3078.48
is in

3078.559 --> 3084.28
and it has maneuverability then it will

3081.04 --> 3087.52
be subjected to relative density

3084.28 --> 3091.92
disequilibrium force

3087.52 --> 3094.64
and that is a measurable palpable force

3091.92 --> 3097.04
that only happens when there is this

3094.64 --> 3099.7599999999998
equilibrium that's why i always say this

3097.04 --> 3102.8
equilibrium force it's very specific

3099.76 --> 3104.96
there is no disequilibrium

3102.8 --> 3107.28
so density this equilibrium between the

3104.96 --> 3109.44
object and the medium then it will not

3107.28 --> 3112.4
be subjected to a force there will be no

3109.44 --> 3115.599
displacement and there will be no extra

3112.4 --> 3115.599
pressure exerted

3120.079 --> 3125.28
right that's funnily enough you could

3122.72 --> 3126.9599999999996
technically even just take like a body

3125.28 --> 3130.079
of water

3126.96 --> 3132.2400000000002
in a balloon or in an aquarium and then

3130.079 --> 3134.319
even though it is its own medium and you

3132.24 --> 3136.24
could like drop a ball in there and then

3134.319 --> 3138.88
it would be subjected to relative

3136.24 --> 3140.24
density in relation to the water as the

3138.88 --> 3142.079
medium

3140.24 --> 3145.7599999999998
but

3142.079 --> 3150.96
the whole aquarium and the water

3145.76 --> 3150.96
in it could also be considered an object

3151.2 --> 3156.8799999999997
in relation

3152.64 --> 3160.0789999999997
to the medium that it is in the air

3156.88 --> 3163.52
yeah and now this effect can be

3160.079 --> 3165.92
quite elaborate in how many things like

3163.52 --> 3168.16
when is it an object when is it a medium

3165.92 --> 3170.559
it's only an object and or it's only a

3168.16 --> 3173.52
medium if there is an object that is

3170.559 --> 3176.0
inside of it free floating at least for

3173.52 --> 3178.079
a while

3176.0 --> 3180.319
no not for just free floating in

3178.079 --> 3181.2000000000003
relation

3180.319 --> 3182.16
well

3181.2 --> 3184.5589999999997
to

3182.16 --> 3187.5989999999997
a content and then that is a medium to

3184.559 --> 3190.1600000000003
the object inside but the whole thing if

3187.599 --> 3192.8
it is separated and in another medium

3190.16 --> 3195.7599999999998
then it on itself could also be

3192.8 --> 3198.4
considered an object within a medium

3195.76 --> 3198.4
separately

3206.4 --> 3211.44
relative density specific gravity well

3208.64 --> 3213.44
that is specific gravity has indeed been

3211.44 --> 3215.92
designated pretty much with it so they

3213.44 --> 3217.68
just had to squirt a little gravity onto

3215.92 --> 3219.28
it has nothing to do with it though

3217.68 --> 3220.839
absolutely nothing it's not even

3219.28 --> 3223.76
involved in the

3220.839 --> 3225.359
formula you get it it's not involved in

3223.76 --> 3227.5200000000004
the formula

3225.359 --> 3229.44
it's nothing to do with gravity

3227.52 --> 3231.839
they had to just call it that and hide

3229.44 --> 3233.599
it somewhere in the corner

3231.839 --> 3235.119
yeah

3233.599 --> 3237.3590000000004
fine you want to call it specific

3235.119 --> 3239.839
gravity that's fine i i'm going to call

3237.359 --> 3244.68
it relative density because that is more

3239.839 --> 3244.68
specific as to what it is about

3257.44 --> 3262.44
what the hell are you talking about all

3259.119 --> 3262.44
about science

3265.359 --> 3268.48
are you talking to me

3269.2 --> 3274.48
oh yeah i can make predictions i just

3271.359 --> 3276.96
did i just did a whole cluster [ __ ] of

3274.48 --> 3279.52
elaborate predictions and even like

3276.96 --> 3281.68
framework of how predictions work with

3279.52 --> 3285.44
relative densities what the hell are you

3281.68 --> 3285.44
talking about vague ideas

3287.359 --> 3291.52
how does relative density give a

3289.52 --> 3293.7599999999998
direction

3291.52 --> 3295.92
i mean do you really have to ask that's

3293.76 --> 3299.119
so freaking simple

3295.92 --> 3302.48
if the object is less dense than the

3299.119 --> 3304.88
medium it goes up if it is denser than

3302.48 --> 3309.44
the medium it goes down

3304.88 --> 3312.799
that's how you determine the direction

3309.44 --> 3315.359
of the force of the disequilibrium force

3312.799 --> 3317.28
that is what it is

3315.359 --> 3319.5989999999997
density isn't a force i'm not saying it

3317.28 --> 3322.6400000000003
is a force that's why i'm saying

3319.599 --> 3326.88
relative density disequilibrium

3322.64 --> 3329.7599999999998
it's one word it is a single specific

3326.88 --> 3332.96
thing it's not the density

3329.76 --> 3335.6800000000003
it is the disequilibrium between the

3332.96 --> 3339.04
density of the object and the medium

3335.68 --> 3341.359
that causes the force

3339.04 --> 3344.079
literally it springs into being it's

3341.359 --> 3346.64
right there you see it manifesting it's

3344.079 --> 3348.2400000000002
displacing something and then if it

3346.64 --> 3350.319
can't displace because there's something

3348.24 --> 3352.16
in the way then it's pressing

3350.319 --> 3354.48
it's right there the force is right

3352.16 --> 3356.319
there relative density disequilibrium

3354.48 --> 3359.88
force

3356.319 --> 3359.88
super conditional

3363.68 --> 3367.7599999999998
how does up and down get defined

3368.16 --> 3371.64
they're the opposite

3378.96 --> 3385.079
i mean

3380.079 --> 3385.079
like dude the [ __ ] you want then

3390.079 --> 3395.119
is in one direction the other is in the

3391.839 --> 3398.4
other direction they're never any other

3395.119 --> 3400.319
separate 90 angle degree to any of those

3398.4 --> 3402.7200000000003
directions it's up and down they're

3400.319 --> 3407.04
exactly the counter opposite there's

3402.72 --> 3409.9199999999996
never a direction anywhere in between

3407.04 --> 3409.92
that's what it is

3410.559 --> 3415.2000000000003
how does dance how does why are you

3413.2 --> 3417.7599999999998
assuming

3415.2 --> 3419.7599999999998
that there is some kind of spiritual

3417.76 --> 3423.3590000000004
process happening

3419.76 --> 3428.4
within a concept

3423.359 --> 3428.4
finding down like is it sentient now

3428.559 --> 3433.2000000000003
it's just down

3430.4 --> 3436.0
it's just down it's just up that's the

3433.2 --> 3437.68
way it is it doesn't find anything

3436.0 --> 3440.72
there's no finding there's no

3437.68 --> 3443.04
determination there's no thinking or

3440.72 --> 3445.5989999999997
feeling or anything going on it just

3443.04 --> 3447.599
goes down or it goes up or it doesn't go

3445.599 --> 3450.079
anywhere because the density of the

3447.599 --> 3451.3590000000004
medium is exactly equal to the density

3450.079 --> 3453.8390000000004
of the object

3451.359 --> 3453.839
that's it

3454.88 --> 3460.6800000000003
there's nothing to find

3457.119 --> 3460.6800000000003
it just does

3465.92 --> 3471.04
and force requires energy yeah well i'm

3468.96 --> 3474.359
sorry it's right there

3471.04 --> 3474.359
it's happening

3477.359 --> 3482.72
i mean isn't that what a force basically

3479.839 --> 3485.68
is you see something displacing

3482.72 --> 3489.64
or pressing isn't that what a force is

3485.68 --> 3489.64
representative of

3491.2 --> 3495.9199999999996
you can throw all these

3493.52 --> 3497.52
mechanical demands at me

3495.92 --> 3499.52
born from all the

3497.52 --> 3500.88
science philosophy and all that that's

3499.52 --> 3503.04
cute

3500.88 --> 3505.44
but i'm just establishing the

3503.04 --> 3507.119
observation what is happening and how it

3505.44 --> 3511.28
is happening

3507.119 --> 3514.1600000000003
i don't care for your needs okay

3511.28 --> 3516.4
your needs for energy no it is

3514.16 --> 3518.16
displacing it's right there

3516.4 --> 3520.88
it's a force

3518.16 --> 3523.2799999999997
that is how a force is classified within

3520.88 --> 3524.7200000000003
physics that's what it is i don't give a

3523.28 --> 3526.559
[ __ ] why

3524.72 --> 3528.72
i'm just establishing that's what's

3526.559 --> 3532.96
happening

3528.72 --> 3534.72
yeah this is not your squirty

3532.96 --> 3537.76
circle jerk

3534.72 --> 3541.5989999999997
for the meaning of all life and energy

3537.76 --> 3543.119
and blah yeah this is what is it this is

3541.599 --> 3546.319
what's happening

3543.119 --> 3548.079
this is not about your fantastical

3546.319 --> 3550.88
dive into the depths of your

3548.079 --> 3552.6400000000003
subconsciousness or whatever

3550.88 --> 3554.96
all become one yeah no that's not what

3552.64 --> 3556.4
this is about this is about science this

3554.96 --> 3558.96
is about physics this is about

3556.4 --> 3563.6800000000003
establishing the cause of an effect

3558.96 --> 3563.68
and being precise with the terminology

3568.16 --> 3573.839
google relative density

3570.4 --> 3576.4
you get sleeping yeah that's right

3573.839 --> 3578.0789999999997
we figured it out together

3576.4 --> 3580.319
well he was first

3578.079 --> 3582.319
first he was my opponent when i actually

3580.319 --> 3583.92
defended gravity before i figured out it

3582.319 --> 3586.48
was an aberration

3583.92 --> 3587.92
then i conceded and well

3586.48 --> 3590.559
revealed

3587.92 --> 3592.48
that there are things like aberrations

3590.559 --> 3595.92
and it's very relevant even now because

3592.48 --> 3598.2400000000002
now there's the etherean aberration

3595.92 --> 3599.6800000000003
and then proceeded to basically join up

3598.24 --> 3600.9599999999996
with

3599.68 --> 3602.96
with the

3600.96 --> 3603.839
sleeping warrior

3602.96 --> 3607.04
to

3603.839 --> 3608.64
get the details exactly sharpen of what

3607.04 --> 3611.44
is actually happening with relative

3608.64 --> 3613.5989999999997
density and i'm very proud to say i've

3611.44 --> 3615.76
mastered the details in every

3613.599 --> 3617.2000000000003
conceivable way concerning relative

3615.76 --> 3620.4
density

3617.2 --> 3622.0
likely even beyond sleeping warriors

3620.4 --> 3624.88
capacity

3622.0 --> 3627.88
although he gets it and he knows i get

3624.88 --> 3627.88
it

3628.16 --> 3634.92
i'm just more precise

3630.0 --> 3634.92
i have more oversight and how that works

3642.559 --> 3647.44
is he published i don't know i don't

3644.319 --> 3650.319
give a [ __ ] who gets a fleeting [ __ ] for

3647.44 --> 3650.319
your publishing

3650.4 --> 3655.52
we're in satan world right now i don't

3652.4 --> 3658.799
give a [ __ ] who published what

3655.52 --> 3662.0
i'm not publishing anything

3658.799 --> 3663.52
it's all just satan's toilet paper

3662.0 --> 3665.839
who gives a [ __ ] if something's

3663.52 --> 3669.2
published i give a [ __ ] if something's

3665.839 --> 3671.04
real if it works if you can test it and

3669.2 --> 3674.799
prove it to yourself

3671.04 --> 3678.0
you could get rid of your [ __ ] biases

3674.799 --> 3680.72
your [ __ ] religious idiocy

3678.0 --> 3683.76
they could just see this is real who

3680.72 --> 3686.72
gives a [ __ ] if some guy you've never

3683.76 --> 3689.8390000000004
even met put it in a paper

3686.72 --> 3689.839
who gives a [ __ ]

3693.44 --> 3698.4
i just care if it works or not

3696.079 --> 3702.2400000000002
and it does relative density

3698.4 --> 3703.44
works it works always have not found a

3702.24 --> 3705.359
single

3703.44 --> 3708.16
single exception

3705.359 --> 3710.48
and i mean you can like get really

3708.16 --> 3712.799
complicated with the setup

3710.48 --> 3715.44
really complicated even introduce other

3712.799 --> 3717.7599999999998
[ __ ] in there and i'll still be able to

3715.44 --> 3720.4
tell you what is happening with a with

3717.76 --> 3722.2400000000002
the relative density even when you mix

3720.4 --> 3723.76
in other four [ __ ]

3722.24 --> 3726.3999999999996
okay

3723.76 --> 3727.8390000000004
it works it always

3726.4 --> 3730.4
works

3727.839 --> 3730.4
always

3734.4 --> 3738.559
publishing is not part of the scientific

3737.2 --> 3741.4399999999996
method

3738.559 --> 3742.799
[ __ ]

3741.44 --> 3744.88
it isn't

3742.799 --> 3747.359
the method is part of the scientific

3744.88 --> 3750.96
method the method is it

3747.359 --> 3751.92
oh oh and and by the way

3750.96 --> 3754.319
yeah

3751.92 --> 3756.079
you might not think much of it but

3754.319 --> 3758.4
officially

3756.079 --> 3762.319
this here what we're doing right here

3758.4 --> 3766.559
this show on youtube being live streamed

3762.319 --> 3766.5589999999997
you know what that is defined as

3766.839 --> 3769.599
published

3768.72 --> 3770.72
oh

3769.599 --> 3772.559
oh

3770.72 --> 3774.16
oh you didn't know

3772.559 --> 3776.6400000000003
well now you do

3774.16 --> 3778.64
it is published yeah there's a whole

3776.64 --> 3781.5989999999997
bunch of [ __ ] out there also being

3778.64 --> 3784.64
published that's just junk

3781.599 --> 3785.76
but this is technically published

3784.64 --> 3788.5589999999997
and so

3785.76 --> 3791.119
sleeping warriors video is

3788.559 --> 3791.119
published

3792.319 --> 3795.799
it's right there

3797.119 --> 3801.52
i just think he would reach more people

3799.119 --> 3804.4
if he wrote a paper

3801.52 --> 3806.4
dude just keep emailing him and nagging

3804.4 --> 3808.48
him like write a paper damn it write a

3806.4 --> 3810.64
paper that maybe one day he'll actually

3808.48 --> 3814.48
do it who knows

3810.64 --> 3814.48
i mean he could do it i think

3816.319 --> 3821.119
but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter

3818.72 --> 3823.0389999999998
if he writes a paper about it or if i

3821.119 --> 3825.52
wrote a paper about it

3823.039 --> 3826.88
or if qe wrote a paper about it it's

3825.52 --> 3829.7599999999998
just not

3826.88 --> 3829.76
it's pointless

3832.88 --> 3838.559
this paper dependency is part of the

3835.599 --> 3840.96
problem

3838.559 --> 3843.119
it doesn't mean anything just because

3840.96 --> 3845.68
it's on paper that doesn't make it

3843.119 --> 3845.6800000000003
legitimate

3846.48 --> 3853.92
it working and being repeatable

3850.48 --> 3856.88
and logically comprehensible

3853.92 --> 3856.88
is more important

3859.92 --> 3866.92
appeal to parchment i like that at least

3863.359 --> 3866.92
a steamy traveler

3875.92 --> 3879.359
oh

3877.92 --> 3882.079
yeah see you later mandy young thanks

3879.359 --> 3882.0789999999997
for popping by

3886.72 --> 3891.839
maybe a video about eggs never yeah but

3888.799 --> 3895.44
you're just a [ __ ] dude

3891.839 --> 3898.0789999999997
hey all about science you're a [ __ ]

3895.44 --> 3901.119
you're just ignoring the evidence

3898.079 --> 3902.6400000000003
it is legitimate it is a legitimate

3901.119 --> 3906.2400000000002
communication

3902.64 --> 3909.2
the experiment is verbally laid out and

3906.24 --> 3911.5989999999997
then executed

3909.2 --> 3915.0389999999998
in front of the camera

3911.599 --> 3916.6400000000003
that's legitimate just because you don't

3915.039 --> 3919.119
think it is legitimate because you're

3916.64 --> 3923.0789999999997
ignoring it doesn't mean it isn't

3919.119 --> 3923.079
you're just an idiot

3941.68 --> 3948.72
doesn't falsify what the [ __ ] is wrong

3944.96 --> 3952.079
with you you goddamn [ __ ]

3948.72 --> 3954.8799999999997
get the [ __ ] out here you goddamn [ __ ]

3952.079 --> 3954.88
piss off

3956.0 --> 3961.76
i'm not dealing with [ __ ] like you

3959.2 --> 3965.799
anymore if you're that [ __ ] then you

3961.76 --> 3965.7990000000004
can get the [ __ ] out

3972.64 --> 3977.52
i have so much sympathy for like physics

3975.359 --> 3980.16
teachers and [ __ ] because they probably

3977.52 --> 3983.68
had to do with asses

3980.16 --> 3986.64
asses like you as well

3983.68 --> 3986.64
unbearable

3988.0 --> 3992.96
people like you literally just shorten

3990.559 --> 3995.96
the lifespan of teachers

3992.96 --> 3995.96
terrible

4013.2 --> 4016.2
uh

4022.079 --> 4026.48
yeah yeah he did rick back i didn't even

4024.72 --> 4029.2799999999997
want to say it

4026.48 --> 4031.359
i didn't even want to say it pisses me

4029.28 --> 4034.2400000000002
off so much

4031.359 --> 4037.52
just what a goddamn [ __ ] just shut

4034.24 --> 4037.52
your [ __ ] mouth

4040.359 --> 4044.16
rudimentary [ __ ]

4045.359 --> 4049.839
somebody whining

4047.28 --> 4051.599
about oh it was not proper science you

4049.839 --> 4054.16
didn't publish it in the paper and then

4051.599 --> 4056.079
he has the [ __ ] gull

4054.16 --> 4058.96
to say something like

4056.079 --> 4062.1600000000003
it's not a legitimate

4058.96 --> 4064.16
proof because it doesn't falsify

4062.16 --> 4066.0789999999997
something else

4064.16 --> 4069.5989999999997
like something else

4066.079 --> 4069.599
you [ __ ] [ __ ]

4074.0 --> 4080.16
no it doesn't dusty flynn gravel spawn

4077.119 --> 4080.1600000000003
you're a weirdo

4086.4 --> 4091.92
okay thank you dare patriot but i'm not

4088.88 --> 4094.079
actually in amsterdam

4091.92 --> 4097.279
might surprise you to learn that the

4094.079 --> 4100.52
netherlands is not a city in the country

4097.279 --> 4100.52
of amsterdam

4113.279 --> 4116.6
but welcome

4124.799 --> 4129.44
okay guys tell me should i just let this

4127.6 --> 4131.839
ass

4129.44 --> 4134.879999999999
with his reoccurring soccer guns should

4131.839 --> 4137.679
i just let him just pull out his

4134.88 --> 4140.56
diarrhea all over my chat for comedic

4137.679 --> 4142.719
value or do you want me to hammer every

4140.56 --> 4144.4800000000005
single thing he says

4142.719 --> 4146.88
i don't know anymore i

4144.48 --> 4147.678999999999
it might be like really funny at this

4146.88 --> 4149.6
point

4147.679 --> 4151.839
it's just i [ __ ] hate these types of

4149.6 --> 4153.92
guys

4151.839 --> 4156.88
but it might be just really funny

4153.92 --> 4160.0
because he's saying such unbelievably

4156.88 --> 4161.52
stupid [ __ ]

4160.0 --> 4164.159
i mean

4161.52 --> 4166.719
this guy might even be dumber than sean

4164.159 --> 4166.719
hawkins

4168.239 --> 4174.239
that is saying something i know but

4171.04 --> 4177.759
like with more faculties but also with

4174.239 --> 4177.759
more delusion and that is

4187.839 --> 4190.64
okay

4189.52 --> 4193.120000000001
next

4190.64 --> 4193.12
we'll see

4195.36 --> 4200.08
just i'm kind of done with the argument

4198.159 --> 4202.799999999999
said what i needed to say about relative

4200.08 --> 4204.0
density and i laid it out and oh i did

4202.8 --> 4205.84
it right

4204.0 --> 4208.159
i have no doubt

4205.84 --> 4210.2390000000005
i didn't even make any hint of a mistake

4208.159 --> 4213.04
today about it

4210.239 --> 4213.04
not even a

4213.76 --> 4217.84
semantical error

4215.76 --> 4217.84
so

4220.719 --> 4227.199
can work sideways no it doesn't

4225.28 --> 4228.639999999999
the [ __ ] are you talking about on the

4227.199 --> 4232.639999999999
level chris

4228.64 --> 4232.64
it doesn't go sideways

4233.6 --> 4238.320000000001
it goes up and down

4235.76 --> 4240.96
if there's something in the way

4238.32 --> 4244.0
and it's fluid

4240.96 --> 4246.4800000000005
then it might spread out it's not

4244.0 --> 4248.64
because it's going sideways

4246.48 --> 4250.718999999999
it's because it's just following the

4248.64 --> 4253.76
path that it can take

4250.719 --> 4253.76
as it goes down

4256.64 --> 4264.2390000000005
or up i mean balloons do the same thing

4261.12 --> 4265.679
alien balloons you have like a staircase

4264.239 --> 4267.5199999999995
with like a

4265.679 --> 4270.8
a flat top

4267.52 --> 4273.52
or that or a diagonal top above it and

4270.8 --> 4275.84
you let a helium balloon

4273.52 --> 4277.280000000001
at the bottom of that staircase yeah it

4275.84 --> 4279.1990000000005
will just

4277.28 --> 4281.28
roll

4279.199 --> 4283.36
diagonally upwards

4281.28 --> 4285.44
why because the helium balloon is

4283.36 --> 4287.44
pressing up because it's less dense than

4285.44 --> 4289.199
the medium it is in but it's also being

4287.44 --> 4290.799999999999
stopped

4289.199 --> 4293.599999999999
by the solid

4290.8 --> 4293.6
diagonal

4294.239 --> 4296.718999999999
ceiling

4296.8 --> 4301.679
and then like a stone would

4298.84 --> 4303.84
diagonally roll down a hill

4301.679 --> 4306.0
so does a helium balloon

4303.84 --> 4310.4400000000005
roll diagonally up

4306.0 --> 4310.44
a slope above a staircase

4314.08 --> 4316.96
raised by gypsies

4318.32 --> 4322.159
it can drive sideways yeah but that's

4320.08 --> 4324.8
just the combination of forces it is

4322.159 --> 4327.44
only going up and down

4324.8 --> 4330.320000000001
the the spreading out the sideways is

4327.44 --> 4330.32
happenstance

4330.88 --> 4335.36
it doesn't just decide like oh let's

4333.679 --> 4337.679
change the axis now we're going to go

4335.36 --> 4340.08
sideways no that's not what it is about

4337.679 --> 4343.28
this is not about where things can go

4340.08 --> 4346.239
it's about where is the force direction

4343.28 --> 4348.48
of the relative density this equilibrium

4346.239 --> 4351.678999999999
and it's only up and down

4348.48 --> 4355.36
now the result of that influence may

4351.679 --> 4357.84
still have material go sideways

4355.36 --> 4359.36
when it can't just go straight down or

4357.84 --> 4361.360000000001
up

4359.36 --> 4364.239
but that has nothing to do with the

4361.36 --> 4367.5199999999995
force direction it doesn't go sideways

4364.239 --> 4367.5199999999995
it's only up and down

4368.48 --> 4372.879999999999
how about that dude are you behind i

4370.56 --> 4375.76
just had a like a

4372.88 --> 4378.719
three-minute description of that

4375.76 --> 4378.719
on the level chris

4380.56 --> 4383.56
uh

4384.8 --> 4389.1990000000005
oh my god guys look at me i'm such an

4386.96 --> 4391.44
echo chamber with all these people

4389.199 --> 4393.919999999999
without wrenches that i'm having a

4391.44 --> 4396.159
debate with beside the people with

4393.92 --> 4399.84
wrenches that are also there

4396.159 --> 4399.839999999999
such an echo chamber man

4401.84 --> 4405.76
i mean today alone there's like

4406.96 --> 4412.2390000000005
five or up to eight

4409.28 --> 4414.719
non-troll persons that just popped up

4412.239 --> 4417.5199999999995
and started the conversation

4414.719 --> 4417.52
pretty incredible

4421.6 --> 4424.4800000000005
yeah yes

4424.56 --> 4429.280000000001
that's right that is weird helium

4427.12 --> 4430.96
balloon going forward as you yeah that's

4429.28 --> 4432.719
because

4430.96 --> 4434.719
the car

4432.719 --> 4436.96
is a medium

4434.719 --> 4439.44
it has gas in it it's locked off right

4436.96 --> 4440.719
windows closed

4439.44 --> 4442.5599999999995
and

4440.719 --> 4444.159
yeah

4442.56 --> 4446.64
if there if the whole thing is

4444.159 --> 4449.839999999999
accelerated then there is acceleration

4446.64 --> 4451.1990000000005
force introduced to the whole medium

4449.84 --> 4453.1990000000005
everything within it is going to be

4451.199 --> 4456.719
subjected to it including the gases that

4453.199 --> 4458.719
are going to rearrange themselves

4456.719 --> 4461.92
the gases within are going to the

4458.719 --> 4464.4
gradient of it is going to redi divide

4461.92 --> 4464.4
itself

4464.64 --> 4468.64
because of the acceleration and anything

4467.04 --> 4471.5199999999995
that is in that medium including the

4468.64 --> 4472.64
helium balloon is gonna conform to the

4471.52 --> 4474.96
new

4472.64 --> 4477.6
virtual direction

4474.96 --> 4479.28
because of the extra force introduced

4477.6 --> 4480.8
acceleration

4479.28 --> 4483.28
isn't that fascinating how that all

4480.8 --> 4485.4400000000005
works

4483.28 --> 4488.719
right so yeah relative density always

4485.44 --> 4490.5599999999995
works but if you introduce acceleration

4488.719 --> 4493.28
into the situation

4490.56 --> 4496.400000000001
then yeah then certainly this axis the

4493.28 --> 4500.159
relative density axis the directions may

4496.4 --> 4501.759999999999
virtually not actually virtually change

4500.159 --> 4505.679
because there's another force being

4501.76 --> 4506.719
introduced this again is very suggestive

4505.679 --> 4510.2390000000005
to

4506.719 --> 4512.4800000000005
the idea of gravity that's why it's an

4510.239 --> 4515.678999999999
aberration because it's so incredibly

4512.48 --> 4518.0
suggestive i literally had this as my

4515.679 --> 4519.28
case defending gravity like three years

4518.0 --> 4521.36
ago

4519.28 --> 4522.719
because it is so suggestive like if you

4521.36 --> 4524.639999999999
combine it with anything it's just like

4522.719 --> 4527.36
but it has to be a force yeah but it

4524.64 --> 4529.04
isn't a force because the model is wrong

4527.36 --> 4531.32
the force is there it's just not a

4529.04 --> 4534.0
gravity force it's relative density

4531.32 --> 4536.5599999999995
disequilibrium force

4534.0 --> 4538.64
and it works the same

4536.56 --> 4541.1990000000005
as gravity except

4538.64 --> 4545.1990000000005
it actually is complete and it's not

4541.199 --> 4547.5199999999995
based on over simplified assumptions

4545.199 --> 4550.239
like gravity and that's why why newton

4547.52 --> 4552.159000000001
never claimed the hypothesis to it

4550.239 --> 4556.599999999999
officially right you might have had a

4552.159 --> 4556.599999999999
good reason to do that you know

4573.04 --> 4577.12
some people say acceleration is the same

4575.28 --> 4579.28
as gravity yeah that's ridiculous

4577.12 --> 4581.84
because acceleration is acceleration and

4579.28 --> 4585.28
gravity is a concept

4581.84 --> 4585.28
it it doesn't do anything

4586.239 --> 4589.239
right

4596.8 --> 4602.64
yeah i know right rick back

4598.88 --> 4602.64
i mean this is the numpty zone

4604.4 --> 4609.839999999999
i mean

4605.44 --> 4609.839999999999
and this is supposed to be our opponent

4610.8 --> 4614.88
these are the people defending

4612.679 --> 4617.92
heliocentrism and this is what's coming

4614.88 --> 4617.92
out of them i mean

4619.36 --> 4626.5599999999995
it's

4621.199 --> 4626.5599999999995
so lame it's almost disparaging because

4626.64 --> 4630.4800000000005
how is this gonna be like an

4628.4 --> 4632.5599999999995
intellectual challenge the only

4630.48 --> 4633.919999999999
challenge that we really have to face is

4632.56 --> 4635.360000000001
to

4633.92 --> 4638.2390000000005
just

4635.36 --> 4641.28
get a grip on our nerves

4638.239 --> 4643.839999999999
it is unnerving how [ __ ] [ __ ] our

4641.28 --> 4646.239
opponents are

4643.84 --> 4648.64
it is literally unnerving

4646.239 --> 4652.32
makes me nervous about the world like is

4648.64 --> 4654.400000000001
this it is this humanity

4652.32 --> 4658.36
jesus

4654.4 --> 4658.36
jesus help us all

4694.64 --> 4701.04
right not nervous to lose the argument

4697.44 --> 4703.839999999999
by the way but more like nervous to have

4701.04 --> 4706.159
the entire world disintegrate around us

4703.84 --> 4708.8
because people are too stupid to

4706.159 --> 4710.239
actually realize how much responsibility

4708.8 --> 4713.6
they have

4710.239 --> 4713.599999999999
in keeping things together

4716.239 --> 4721.4
the things that actually matter and not

4718.08 --> 4721.4
your delusions

4724.96 --> 4727.84
like for example

4726.48 --> 4729.678999999999
faculties

4727.84 --> 4732.32
precision faculties

4729.679 --> 4734.96
skills dynamic

4732.32 --> 4736.799999999999
skills skills that

4734.96 --> 4739.04
even if you're in a completely different

4736.8 --> 4741.84
situation you can still apply them

4739.04 --> 4744.239
dynamic skills you know that's actually

4741.84 --> 4748.04
the most valuable resource

4744.239 --> 4748.04
a person can have

4748.32 --> 4753.28
where is it

4750.08 --> 4756.239
i feel i got it i'm doing my best to

4753.28 --> 4756.239
to master that

4759.28 --> 4762.96
yeah how much power have they given away

4761.36 --> 4765.12
exactly

4762.96 --> 4769.44
depletion

4765.12 --> 4772.44
human depletion human intellectual

4769.44 --> 4772.44
depletion

4784.4 --> 4789.28
and if you found it yeah then i would be

4786.64 --> 4792.04
wrong well i'm not you haven't found any

4789.28 --> 4794.32
and you can dream about your hypothesis

4792.04 --> 4795.84
hypotheticals that are never going to

4794.32 --> 4797.92
happen all day long it's never going to

4795.84 --> 4799.360000000001
happen because i'm not wrong and no i'm

4797.92 --> 4800.96
not wrong

4799.36 --> 4804.08
if

4800.96 --> 4807.28
i was wrong you wouldn't be a numpty

4804.08 --> 4809.36
[ __ ] in my chat saying such things

4807.28 --> 4811.5199999999995
because you're that desperate that

4809.36 --> 4813.759999999999
wouldn't be happening because if i could

4811.52 --> 4816.080000000001
have been wrong then you wouldn't have

4813.76 --> 4818.719
landed in this position in the first

4816.08 --> 4822.239
place you would have had actual grip an

4818.719 --> 4824.88
actual argument you don't

4822.239 --> 4827.12
that's why you're in my chat making a

4824.88 --> 4829.04
stupid statement like that

4827.12 --> 4832.199
because you don't

4829.04 --> 4832.199
you see

4848.56 --> 4853.84
oh what do you do

4851.36 --> 4855.04
when you think you might have turned out

4853.84 --> 4858.32
to be wrong

4855.04 --> 4861.12
you re-evaluate and you adapt

4858.32 --> 4864.159
i do it continually

4861.12 --> 4867.12
and most of the things that i

4864.159 --> 4869.28
bump into about being wrong

4867.12 --> 4871.679
i don't even communicate that because

4869.28 --> 4874.159
there's literally nobody in the world

4871.679 --> 4875.04
that even could just pick up on that

4874.159 --> 4879.44
[ __ ]

4875.04 --> 4879.44
yeah i'll just have to do it on my own

4880.32 --> 4882.88
right

4881.12 --> 4884.88
so that's what it what you do when you

4882.88 --> 4886.4800000000005
found out you're wrong

4884.88 --> 4889.84
you

4886.48 --> 4891.199
master that mistake and you adapt

4889.84 --> 4895.04
done

4891.199 --> 4896.719
no issue for us that's no issue

4895.04 --> 4898.08
why don't you try to do that with your

4896.719 --> 4900.08
ball earth

4898.08 --> 4903.36
yeah

4900.08 --> 4904.159
what would you do if you find out

4903.36 --> 4905.679
that

4904.159 --> 4907.599999999999
everything you believed in that the

4905.679 --> 4909.92
earth was a globe well that that was

4907.6 --> 4909.92
wrong

4910.159 --> 4913.92
would you

4911.6 --> 4915.76
spend years and years and years hanging

4913.92 --> 4916.96
around with other people that can't let

4915.76 --> 4920.719
it go

4916.96 --> 4923.52
to reinforce your neurosis

4920.719 --> 4925.84
and then jet skank people that could

4923.52 --> 4928.0
actually make that leap not because you

4925.84 --> 4930.0
want to be able to make that leap too

4928.0 --> 4931.44
but because you want to attack those

4930.0 --> 4935.96
that could

4931.44 --> 4935.96
is that what you're doing now fulham

4950.08 --> 4955.04
or is this just some kind of weird

4952.32 --> 4956.88
universal question

4955.04 --> 4958.639
because it it sounded like you were

4956.88 --> 4960.88
trying to

4958.639 --> 4962.96
push some doubt

4960.88 --> 4966.36
which is typically anti-flat earth or

4962.96 --> 4966.36
troll behavior

4991.6 --> 4997.280000000001
but yeah it's not very clear though i

4994.32 --> 4997.28
don't know who you are

4997.6 --> 5002.96
and mostly people that start out

5000.88 --> 5005.4400000000005
entering my chat asking that questions

5002.96 --> 5006.2390000000005
are scumbags and that's why i assumed

5005.44 --> 5009.919999999999
that

5006.239 --> 5009.919999999999
but if you're saying like oh this is

5011.04 --> 5015.84
it's just an open question

5014.32 --> 5018.239
something else

5015.84 --> 5020.4800000000005
so we'll see

5018.239 --> 5024.44
said what i said

5020.48 --> 5024.44
still stand behind that

5033.92 --> 5038.0
see

5035.76 --> 5040.88
now professor phil was all obsessed

5038.0 --> 5044.4
about they're just like

5040.88 --> 5047.12
we need to guard the flat earthers

5044.4 --> 5050.719
because what if they might be wrong

5047.12 --> 5052.239
about something oh my god oh

5050.719 --> 5053.679
like

5052.239 --> 5055.839999999999
why don't you just write a science

5053.679 --> 5059.36
fiction book about how flat earthers

5055.84 --> 5059.360000000001
were wrong and then what happens

5060.32 --> 5064.44
don't you just do that then

5070.0 --> 5074.159
to just fantasize about what would

5072.0 --> 5079.96
happen if flat earthers turned out to be

5074.159 --> 5079.96
wrong who knew it was a globe after all

5095.84 --> 5099.1990000000005
ah well terry

5097.76 --> 5102.159000000001
i wouldn't

5099.199 --> 5104.08
jump to that conclusion

5102.159 --> 5107.12
so

5104.08 --> 5109.199
i mean it will spread wide it is already

5107.12 --> 5111.28
spreading pretty wide and it will spread

5109.199 --> 5113.599999999999
even wider but that it's never going to

5111.28 --> 5115.28
be accepted by all

5113.6 --> 5118.56
that's

5115.28 --> 5120.88
an ideological view that will never

5118.56 --> 5120.88
happen

5122.4 --> 5127.12
i mean if seriously if it would be

5125.04 --> 5128.8
accepted by all there will literally be

5127.12 --> 5130.639
flat earthers that are going to say i'm

5128.8 --> 5132.4800000000005
not a flat earther anymore because now

5130.639 --> 5136.12
everybody believes it and now i don't

5132.48 --> 5136.12
want to do this anymore

5142.719 --> 5145.679
oh brandon cook

5152.159 --> 5158.5599999999995
oh very wrong he's just very very wrong

5158.58 --> 5163.28
[Music]

5160.88 --> 5165.1990000000005
it's so good entertainment because you

5163.28 --> 5167.36
just assume we're wrong or you don't

5165.199 --> 5170.08
even inquire you don't even have an

5167.36 --> 5173.36
example of how it's wrong

5170.08 --> 5175.44
just stupid scattergunning references to

5173.36 --> 5180.0
old [ __ ] that has all been addressed and

5175.44 --> 5180.0
all been meticulously disproven

5180.96 --> 5183.84
for years

5192.0 --> 5197.679
yeah

5194.0 --> 5200.239
flat earth is very wrong is a personal

5197.679 --> 5202.96
religious statement

5200.239 --> 5205.839999999999
it's a religious statement

5202.96 --> 5207.12
based in denial it's virtue signaling

5205.84 --> 5212.08
denial

5207.12 --> 5215.48
to the god allies satan your master

5212.08 --> 5215.48
did you forget

5249.679 --> 5256.12
oh come on

5253.12 --> 5256.12
really

5274.48 --> 5278.28
yeah well said illegy

5290.28 --> 5295.84
uae what what is that tear it

5302.56 --> 5306.0
two buildings

5304.96 --> 5307.44
yeah

5306.0 --> 5309.84
there's a lot of people there i know

5307.44 --> 5309.839999999999
darren

5317.679 --> 5321.12
hello there patriot it's not about

5319.679 --> 5323.36
believing

5321.12 --> 5325.199
oh it isn't about believing it's about

5323.36 --> 5327.599999999999
figuring out

5325.199 --> 5329.5199999999995
what it actually is and where the claims

5327.6 --> 5330.400000000001
come from how do you attempt to prove

5329.52 --> 5334.320000000001
that

5330.4 --> 5338.08
how are you calculating measuring

5334.32 --> 5340.96
the data that you are utilizing as your

5338.08 --> 5342.48
proof for the claim

5340.96 --> 5344.2390000000005
and then you just work out is this

5342.48 --> 5347.04
realist is not real is this

5344.239 --> 5349.678999999999
presuppositional oh wait yeah all the

5347.04 --> 5351.76
globe claims are all presuppositional

5349.679 --> 5353.6
easily traceable

5351.76 --> 5356.96
no exception

5353.6 --> 5360.159000000001
all presuppositional all of them rest on

5356.96 --> 5361.84
our value presupposition

5360.159 --> 5365.12
all of them

5361.84 --> 5367.84
r and g

5365.12 --> 5370.4
there is no globe claim without it

5367.84 --> 5371.6
i mean as soon as those elements

5370.4 --> 5374.96
are missing

5371.6 --> 5374.96
the whole thing falls apart

5376.8 --> 5379.8
mathematically

5384.08 --> 5387.44
oh you mean photoshop

5388.239 --> 5393.919999999999
latest photoshop

5391.04 --> 5397.12

5718.48 --> 5722.638999999999
happening now in my chat i mean i'm not

5720.56 --> 5725.4400000000005
gonna do this every day but

5722.639 --> 5728.08
they're squirty but at least they're not

5725.44 --> 5730.0
like

5728.08 --> 5732.239
not gammying out

5730.0 --> 5734.48
or anything most of them accept that

5732.239 --> 5736.799999999999
[ __ ] that just keeps coming back

5734.48 --> 5738.959999999999
with the sock counts

5736.8 --> 5740.4800000000005
despite that i'm really hoping you guys

5738.96 --> 5742.56
will uh

5740.48 --> 5746.159
considering supporting me and maybe you

5742.56 --> 5746.159000000001
find this kind of stimulating

5748.4 --> 5752.32
who am i kidding it's unbearable

5752.719 --> 5757.679
then just a reminder like yeah these

5755.36 --> 5762.0
people for some reason there's always

5757.679 --> 5764.2390000000005
just this rowdy shitty crowd

5762.0 --> 5766.08
right outside the door always wanting to

5764.239 --> 5769.44
get in the workshop and they're just

5766.08 --> 5771.5199999999995
gonna waste their time and this is it

5769.44 --> 5773.759999999999
i kind of let him in

5771.52 --> 5773.76
just

5774.32 --> 5777.44
to see what would happen

5780.48 --> 5784.5599999999995
right so if you appreciate my activities

5782.88 --> 5787.1990000000005
and i think i do

5784.56 --> 5789.1990000000005
i like my activities i like my show

5787.199 --> 5792.32
sometimes not always sometimes like oh

5789.199 --> 5794.08
my god i'm not gonna watch this one back

5792.32 --> 5795.5199999999995
and then like a week later or something

5794.08 --> 5797.04
i might actually check it out and i'm

5795.52 --> 5799.76
like well that was actually really good

5797.04 --> 5802.719
why didn't i want to watch that

5799.76 --> 5804.96
it's like my streams really surprise me

5802.719 --> 5808.96
when i watch them back it is sometimes

5804.96 --> 5810.56
just like hey that's another person

5808.96 --> 5812.639
wait but that's me

5810.56 --> 5814.56
it's it's odd

5812.639 --> 5816.56
but i do appreciate my streams and i

5814.56 --> 5818.2390000000005
wish i could keep doing that forever and

5816.56 --> 5821.280000000001
getting better and better but in order

5818.239 --> 5823.119
to do that i'm gonna have to need

5821.28 --> 5824.96
to get support

5823.119 --> 5827.5199999999995
from viewers and listeners and

5824.96 --> 5829.84
participants

5827.52 --> 5833.679
through the paypal primarily

5829.84 --> 5833.679
i'm very happy it all still works

5835.199 --> 5838.638999999999
and yeah that way i can basically keep

5837.679 --> 5840.96
fed

5838.639 --> 5843.6
keep myself fed

5840.96 --> 5846.08
and just continue this ride i think i'm

5843.6 --> 5848.320000000001
doing great i'm sharpening and i i want

5846.08 --> 5852.5599999999995
to keep it that way and it seems to be i

5848.32 --> 5852.5599999999995
seem to be able to keep it this way now

5852.719 --> 5857.679
and and that's all i really hope there's

5854.719 --> 5859.52
not going to be some big summer crash

5857.679 --> 5862.32
might still happen i don't know you

5859.52 --> 5864.8
never really know

5862.32 --> 5867.92
somewhere in autumn

5864.8 --> 5869.92
but i really hope i can just up uphold

5867.92 --> 5871.119
this high level

5869.92 --> 5874.159
insight

5871.119 --> 5876.88
and energy and enthusiasm and creativity

5874.159 --> 5878.239
and just keep it going

5876.88 --> 5880.2390000000005
so if you

5878.239 --> 5883.199
appreciate my activities please donate

5880.239 --> 5885.36
to my paypal that would be great

5883.199 --> 5888.239
gives me a little boost of energy in the

5885.36 --> 5891.92
moment that literally just makes my

5888.239 --> 5893.199
worries disintegrate and then make

5891.92 --> 5894.84
more room

5893.199 --> 5897.28
for

5894.84 --> 5900.2390000000005
activity here

5897.28 --> 5904.599999999999
mental activity

5900.239 --> 5904.599999999999
and more sharpness and precision

5920.56 --> 5924.56
you're hounded when i'm live

5922.639 --> 5926.0
okay peaches well maybe

5924.56 --> 5927.84
weird

5926.0 --> 5930.56
maybe you're just getting a lot of

5927.84 --> 5932.32
resolve energy through me then that's

5930.56 --> 5934.8
great actually i mean

5932.32 --> 5936.719
it's actually a good sign it's annoying

5934.8 --> 5940.159000000001
that you keep getting interrupted but

5936.719 --> 5940.159
isn't it technically good

5940.48 --> 5946.32
or is it just people that are just

5942.4 --> 5946.32
whining then it's not good

5951.28 --> 5957.199
what were i drinking in the beginning

5953.44 --> 5957.199
wait you mean just green tea

5963.44 --> 5968.5599999999995
so i'm whining today ah well i guess

5966.719 --> 5970.96
it's in the air the trolls are out

5968.56 --> 5973.76
whining too so i think there's just a a

5970.96 --> 5975.679
gamma wave going on it probably already

5973.76 --> 5977.280000000001
started yesterday

5975.679 --> 5979.28
i think we're probably going to have

5977.28 --> 5981.36
more ether [ __ ] over at the flat earth

5979.28 --> 5983.199
debate very predictable

5981.36 --> 5985.28
and it's not over yet right they still

5983.199 --> 5986.5599999999995
have more squirting to do before they

5985.28 --> 5989.759999999999
give it up

5986.56 --> 5990.639
and nathan has some more spanking to do

5989.76 --> 5992.88
with

5990.639 --> 5992.88
like

5993.44 --> 5997.919999999999
yeah

5994.719 --> 5997.92
with a shovel or something

6001.84 --> 6006.08

6048.239 --> 6053.599999999999
why don't you go to the flat earth

6050.0 --> 6053.6
debates and find out okay

6054.32 --> 6059.5199999999995
it's a concept it's an aberration

6057.28 --> 6061.92
it's not real just like gravity yet

6059.52 --> 6064.320000000001
people insist that it is real even

6061.92 --> 6066.08
though they cannot find proof for it

6064.32 --> 6067.599999999999
they insist because of the structure

6066.08 --> 6070.239
that forms in their mind and that

6067.6 --> 6072.08
connects it all

6070.239 --> 6074.48
it's an aberration

6072.08 --> 6077.6
right anyway i'll be back tomorrow with

6074.48 --> 6079.04
