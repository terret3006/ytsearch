3.199 --> 8.599
hello hello welcome

5.799 --> 12.679
back the third

8.599 --> 16.36
part of this uh what's now kind of

12.679 --> 16.36
turning into a test show

22.82 --> 30.08
[Music]

27.519 --> 32.64
Mostly well at least this time I got a

30.08 --> 36.32
connection without having to be plugged

32.64 --> 40.6
in directly into my computer so it yeah

36.32 --> 42.16
I am doing it now with a Wi-Fi access

40.6 --> 47.079
directly

42.16 --> 47.07899999999999
directly so at least that's something

62.079 --> 67.759
now yeah I accidentally disconnected for

64.96 --> 70.52
some reason even though I had two

67.759 --> 72.72
networks effectively running at the same

70.52 --> 73.92
time through the same card no less which

72.72 --> 78.84
is kind of

73.92 --> 80.759
weird when I unplugged it it

78.84 --> 84.4
like

80.759 --> 87.28
just disconnected YouTube entirely that

84.4 --> 89.479
was very weird I had to like take out

87.28 --> 90.799
another plug just to get it working

89.479 --> 94.119
again

90.799 --> 94.119
very odd

122.88 --> 128.16
right so yeah I'm now interfac I guess

126.0 --> 132.8
that does mean that my network card

128.16 --> 132.79999999999998
actually does work which is a great

134.04 --> 141.12
relief I haven't been able to interface

137.48 --> 143.04
with like other Wi-Fi networks though

141.12 --> 145.84
which is a bit of a

143.04 --> 148.239
disappointment which means like I'm not

145.84 --> 151.84
being capable of

148.239 --> 151.84
like doing it

151.879 --> 157.04
with like the neighbors networks that is

154.64 --> 157.04
very

171.319 --> 178.48
disappointing right anyway welcome back

174.04 --> 178.48
Gary Fe and Richard G

189.84 --> 196.24
it's kind of cold in here by the way

193.0 --> 199.459
weather is not exactly

196.24 --> 199.459
[Music]

203.08 --> 207.87900000000002
fantastic it's been very clouded

211.799 --> 215.0
and stormy at

227.72 --> 234.56
times beautiful day a bit chilly

230.92 --> 237.2
okay oh glad to hear at least you got

234.56 --> 237.2
good weather

238.72 --> 242.76

259.329 --> 274.38
[Music]

277.68 --> 280.68
for

307.12 --> 310.72
10K wow 10

313.199 --> 318.88
kilometers like this morning first ride

315.88 --> 318.88
of the Year

328.639 --> 332.68
wow for

360.0 --> 362.199
hold

381.08 --> 384.68
on sorry about

387.44 --> 394.319
that right well at least my

391.25 --> 397.639
[Music]

394.319 --> 401.0
it's working so that's great even though

397.639 --> 403.919
it's all on Wi-Fi I'm not big fan of

401.0 --> 406.199
that at least that thing is working so

403.919 --> 407.96
that's I don't even have to like contact

406.199 --> 412.24
my nephew

407.96 --> 412.23999999999995
now about it

419.97 --> 423.16900000000004
[Music]

443.08 --> 448.75899999999996
Le I got it up and running yeah yeah

444.68 --> 448.759
yeah no it's cool

449.919 --> 453.87899999999996
now I just wish I had another way to

451.96 --> 456.68
like tap

453.879 --> 459.8
into

456.68 --> 461.879
another another Network and be

459.8 --> 464.599
successful at it like all my attempts

461.879 --> 467.8
there to do that have been unsuccessful

464.599 --> 472.039
thus far which is quite

467.8 --> 472.039
disappointing but at least this thing is

473.199 --> 476.44
working that's

476.599 --> 482.68
something now all I I wish I could like

480.84 --> 485.71999999999997
check it though like how much

482.68 --> 490.159
information is still like on that thing

485.72 --> 490.15900000000005
I don't even know how to check that

509.5 --> 512.75
[Music]

529.8 --> 534.279
like I don't know how much information

531.88 --> 537.519
is like going how much I'm basically

534.279 --> 541.4399999999999
using up I don't know how to even check

537.519 --> 541.44
that how do you check that

547.56 --> 551.92
should last a good while yeah well I

549.519 --> 556.12
don't know how to check how much I'm

551.92 --> 559.64
actually using how much do I how how do

556.12 --> 559.64
I check that

574.079 --> 578.399
hey thank Phil good to see you

600.92 --> 605.8
is everyone sharing the

603.079 --> 608.5999999999999
data

605.8 --> 610.4399999999999
yes no well not currently right now

608.6 --> 611.9590000000001
currently I'm the only one home so I'm

610.44 --> 615.36
the only one on the network I just need

611.959 --> 617.3199999999999
to know like how much because there was

615.36 --> 620.399
a specific warning that things like

617.32 --> 623.6
YouTube and Netflix tend to like really

620.399 --> 623.6
drain the data a

625.92 --> 631.3199999999999
lot find usage in settings yes

632.279 --> 636.32
yeah that's that's nice

674.76 --> 678.8
I don't know where to find it

706.639 --> 709.639
all

723.02 --> 733.8299999999999
[Applause]

814.279 --> 816.959
data

817.16 --> 822.16
usage yeah I don't even know where to

819.56 --> 822.16
find that

830.44 --> 837.5600000000001
here yeah debatable D I'm back again I

834.36 --> 840.16
accidentally disconnected when I

unplugged the device from my computer

840.16 --> 843.639
even though I had the Wi-Fi

847.72 --> 853.5600000000001
connected debatable D do you have any

850.16 --> 855.8389999999999
idea how I can find out how much data

853.56 --> 855.8389999999999
I'm

858.88 --> 865.37
expanding metered connection under

861.959 --> 868.4599999999999
network settings

865.37 --> 868.46
[Music]

887.12 --> 893.36
what I I don't know what you're talking

890.36 --> 893.36
about

927.759 --> 933.639
metered connection

929.68 --> 933.6389999999999
I I don't know where to even look for

956.68 --> 965.0
that no debatable DM using Windows 7 so

961.12 --> 965.0
I don't even have that

1015.279 --> 1019.279
Open start okay

1023.24 --> 1026.079
okay

1026.71 --> 1029.779
[Applause]

something happening on there

1099.76 --> 1103.2
[ __ ] data

1103.24 --> 1109.32

what is

1134.6 --> 1142.6399999999999
this how much is this 200

1139.76 --> 1142.64
megabytes a

1149.32 --> 1152.559
second that

1158.84 --> 1166.6
much bytes per second it's like

1163.6 --> 1166.6
1093

1167.72 --> 1172.24
million that's what it says

1203.12 --> 1206.4799999999998
am I downloading something

1209.36 --> 1212.84

1278.81 --> 1281.829
[Music]

1282.679 --> 1288.5590000000002
I don't know what's going on man why is

it taking up so much

1330.6 --> 1334.7199999999998
okay well thanks debatable D for all the

1332.679 --> 1338.96

1401.48 --> 1410.32
mean I wish I could go on and on but uh

1406.84 --> 1414.6789999999999
at least I got this thing s working now

1410.32 --> 1420.52
and now I got to figure out how else

1414.679 --> 1423.039
to like go about and maybe find a better

1420.52 --> 1428.44
access to streaming so I don't have to

1423.039 --> 1428.44
worry about running out of data as much

1448.63 --> 1452.679
[Music]

1457.57 --> 1462.81
[Music]

1467.0 --> 1472.2
right but yeah it's going to

1469.2 --> 1475.3600000000001
uh tough times this reminds me of like

1472.2 --> 1478.52
the South Park episode where the

1475.36 --> 1480.6399999999999
internet got turned off and then it's

1478.52 --> 1482.36
like wild west without the internet and

1480.64 --> 1485.96
everybody's

1482.36 --> 1488.039
all dried just looking for a little bit

1485.96 --> 1490.3600000000001
of internet I mean that's kind of like

1488.039 --> 1495.0
where I'm at right now and I'm really

1490.36 --> 1495.0
lucky to have anything at all

1499.2 --> 1504.039
and uh yeah I mean all my internet

1501.799 --> 1506.76
habits and everything it's all

1504.039 --> 1508.0
just like yeah I don't have the room for

1506.76 --> 1510.72
anything of

1508.0 --> 1513.12
that I can't like I'm not going to be

1510.72 --> 1515.76
able to like play my typical games and

1513.12 --> 1517.76
all that because it just I don't have

1515.76 --> 1519.8799999999999
the room well I don't know how much I'm

1517.76 --> 1522.48
expending I'm going to check though I'm

1519.88 --> 1525.24
going to figure out how how to find out

1522.48 --> 1529.559
exactly like how much internet

1525.24 --> 1532.6
I'm I'm pumping so that I know like how

1529.559 --> 1534.0
long I could hold on to doing that

1532.6 --> 1536.9599999999998
without

1534.0 --> 1540.64
accidentally Throwing It All overboard

1536.96 --> 1540.64
in in like half an hour or

1541.159 --> 1547.88
something but

1543.72 --> 1551.84
uh yeah I do really appreciate all the

1547.88 --> 1554.48
help and I really really appreciate just

1551.84 --> 1558.9599999999998
seeing you guys

1554.48 --> 1561.3990000000001
again in my chat

1558.96 --> 1563.679
and I I wish I could I I wish I could

1561.399 --> 1564.76
give you more I could I just I just want

1563.679 --> 1568.76
to

1564.76 --> 1571.08
do just the normal streams again but I'm

1568.76 --> 1573.799
glad that I at least can just say hi

1571.08 --> 1577.48
guys I'm here I'm still

1573.799 --> 1579.679
alive I'm still alive guys although

1577.48 --> 1581.48
sometimes it feels like I'm in solitary

1579.679 --> 1584.44
or something I mean it's not an

1581.48 --> 1587.3600000000001
exaggeration it's what it feels like

1584.44 --> 1590.159
like yeah I can move outside but I mean

1587.36 --> 1592.1589999999999
I don't know any body outside I they

1590.159 --> 1595.48
know me by looks they know where I live

1592.159 --> 1595.48
they don't know anything about

1595.72 --> 1603.96
me except like what I might have told

1600.52 --> 1607.2
them like some people know about issues

1603.96 --> 1607.2
that I got in all that

1613.84 --> 1620.76
but it's been really tough not having

1617.6 --> 1623.8799999999999
regular Internet available but I I can

1620.76 --> 1626.96
at least do some things again

1623.88 --> 1630.3990000000001
and now if I could just find out like

1626.96 --> 1632.96
how to keep track of how much internet

1630.399 --> 1636.36
I'm spending since there's now no more

1632.96 --> 1638.52
unlimited internet for at least two

1636.36 --> 1641.52
weeks then I

1638.52 --> 1641.52
can

1642.12 --> 1646.6789999999999
potentially know if streaming is

1645.36 --> 1649.6789999999999
[Music]

1646.679 --> 1652.799
doable and like

1649.679 --> 1655.6000000000001
if I could watch certain

1652.799 --> 1660.679
streams without like draining it too

1655.6 --> 1660.6789999999999
much I just need to figure that out

1694.399 --> 1698.559
right

1696.0 --> 1701.76
anyway yeah I hope that everybody out

1698.559 --> 1705.24
there is doing

1701.76 --> 1707.039
okay I'm kind of like I'm not even aware

1705.24 --> 1710.1200000000001
what's been happening out there through

1707.039 --> 1710.12
the news and all that

1720.679 --> 1726.279
I hope everybody's been doing okay

1722.72 --> 1728.96
better than I have I mean I've certainly

1726.279 --> 1731.0
like I'm I've been like seeing this as

1728.96 --> 1732.76
like this is just the challenge this is

1731.0 --> 1736.159
like the spring

1732.76 --> 1738.84
challenge maybe yeah the eclipse

1736.159 --> 1742.3600000000001
event the Phoenix

1738.84 --> 1744.4399999999998
event it it feels like this is like a

1742.36 --> 1747.36
personal challenge for me and like I

1744.44 --> 1748.88
have to figure this out have to learn to

1747.36 --> 1752.559
deal with

1748.88 --> 1755.3600000000001
it face it go through it and then on the

1752.559 --> 1760.519
other side I'll be stronger for it once

1755.36 --> 1760.519
I like get things in order and

1762.919 --> 1768.64
everything I'm not missing much okay

1765.679 --> 1771.3990000000001
thanks for telling me Richard G I'm glad

1768.64 --> 1771.3990000000001
that you're doing

1775.08 --> 1781.399
okay I've been missing all the Owen

1777.36 --> 1781.399
Benjamin shows though

1818.6 --> 1821.9599999999998
good to have time for personal

1820.279 --> 1826.0
reflection

1821.96 --> 1831.44
yeah in a way it

1826.0 --> 1831.44
is but it's been unpleasant as

1856.919 --> 1861.5590000000002
well hello Greg brunzel

1893.6 --> 1897.1589999999999
our things could be

1897.6 --> 1901.84
better I'm still trying to figure out

1900.6 --> 1904.399
like how

1901.84 --> 1907.9599999999998
to do this

1904.399 --> 1911.12
basically and I'm now on a limited

1907.96 --> 1914.6000000000001
amount of internet

1911.12 --> 1916.799
data so I yeah I I don't know if I'm

1914.6 --> 1918.9599999999998
going to be able to like do a stream

1916.799 --> 1922.08
regularly

1918.96 --> 1924.279
and even if I did like unless I like get

1922.08 --> 1928.399
unlimited data available again I'm going

1924.279 --> 1930.6
to be just like kind

1928.399 --> 1933.8799999999999
of not in

1930.6 --> 1936.9189999999999
form to just do what I

1933.88 --> 1939.3200000000002
do what what happened with the regular

1936.919 --> 1941.6390000000001
internet well there's like a wire break

1939.32 --> 1944.32
probably

1941.639 --> 1947.1589999999999
somewhere and it's

1944.32 --> 1948.799
taking it's taken quite a lot of time

1947.159 --> 1952.1200000000001
even find that

1948.799 --> 1954.76
out and like the repair is going to

1952.12 --> 1957.279
potentially be the 1st of May and then

1954.76 --> 1960.84
hopefully they will resolve it but who

1957.279 --> 1960.84
knows how long this is going to

1962.159 --> 1968.0
take but yeah I'm now doing this thanks

1964.919 --> 1968.0
to a backup

1974.0 --> 1980.44
internet and that's it

1976.84 --> 1980.4399999999998
like just doing

1982.399 --> 1988.4399999999998
this YouTube and Netflix can really eat

1985.039 --> 1988.44
up your data yeah I know

1991.519 --> 1997.3990000000001
that do I have libraries around yeah but

1995.08 --> 2001.36
I'm not going to like move my

1997.399 --> 2006.279
entire desktop computer to a library I

2001.36 --> 2006.279
mean that makes no damn sense

2008.32 --> 2014.039
I mean if I like need to just like

2010.72 --> 2017.08
communicate or check email or whatever

2014.039 --> 2019.559
then I can take my laptop that's how I

2017.08 --> 2022.96
left that message last

2019.559 --> 2025.44
time right I can take my laptop

2022.96 --> 2028.6390000000001
somewhere to a neighbor or

2025.44 --> 2033.679
whatever but like I can't do live

2028.639 --> 2033.6789999999999
streams or whatever like that

2046.84 --> 2053.0
so unless I can get some kind of like

2049.159 --> 2056.399
unlimited internet right here it's just

2053.0 --> 2056.399
no point there no point in

2062.599 --> 2068.2400000000002
trying right I'm going to have to hold

2065.2 --> 2071.5989999999997
off on like downloading stuff

2068.24 --> 2076.24
movies or whatever for a while as well

2071.599 --> 2076.2400000000002
it's just not going to happen for a few

2078.879 --> 2084.3199999999997
weeks libraries have individual rooms

2081.879 --> 2087.2
for people do live stream that's cool

2084.32 --> 2087.2000000000003
and all that but I

2088.359 --> 2095.2
mean I'm not going to go to a freaking

2091.28 --> 2097.3590000000004
Library like no Greg it doesn't work I

2095.2 --> 2101.7599999999998
can't do it through my laptop and I'm

2097.359 --> 2104.4
not going to like hand carry my desktop

2101.76 --> 2107.7200000000003
with the Monitor and my keyboard and all

2104.4 --> 2109.76
the freaking wires on a daily basis to

2107.72 --> 2115.2799999999997
the freaking

2109.76 --> 2115.28
Library like no it's not going to

2118.04 --> 2124.64
happen yeah I mean that would work if I

2121.04 --> 2126.68
had a like a a good laptop with which

2124.64 --> 2129.96
with a buil-in cam and all that that's

2126.68 --> 2134.5989999999997
like specifically me for that kind of

2129.96 --> 2134.599
thing but uh yeah it doesn't

2136.4 --> 2141.2400000000002
work not what I was suggest okay fair

2141.599 --> 2148.2400000000002
enough but yeah I mean I

2145.32 --> 2151.04
can get

2148.24 --> 2153.68
access just using my laptop if it's

2151.04 --> 2157.72
really necessary and I have this now

2153.68 --> 2159.3999999999996
right now so I have some internet access

2157.72 --> 2164.52
says don't worry about

2159.4 --> 2168.04
it it's just I don't have unlimited data

2164.52 --> 2171.56
trafficking so I'm probably not going to

2168.04 --> 2175.4
like stream every day

2171.56 --> 2175.4
now for another two

2186.56 --> 2190.56
weeks for

2210.27 --> 2213.429

2387.92 --> 2395.6800000000003
but yeah for now I thank you all for

2391.88 --> 2398.6800000000003
sitting with me on this update live

2395.68 --> 2398.68
stream

2399.64 --> 2404.839
and yeah I can't say whether I'm going

2402.079 --> 2407.6800000000003
to be like back tomorrow or

2404.839 --> 2410.0789999999997
anything but I'll try to be back as soon

2407.68 --> 2410.0789999999997
as I

2410.359 --> 2416.319
can and maybe like get back to like a

2414.16 --> 2418.56
proper show again where it's just where

2416.319 --> 2421.56
we could talk and have fun and

2418.56 --> 2421.56
everything

2431.4 --> 2438.04
right if any of you could help out

2434.2 --> 2438.04
through the PayPal that would be really

2439.88 --> 2446.92
helpful so yeah please donate through

2443.28 --> 2449.3590000000004
the PayPal in the description box that

2446.92 --> 2449.359
would be

2451.28 --> 2458.7200000000003
great if you can otherwise yeah I'll

2454.319 --> 2458.72
just I'll just try to manage

2460.52 --> 2466.68
and hopefully I can yeah get back to

2464.4 --> 2468.92
streaming I mean I'll probably be back

2466.68 --> 2472.48
to streaming in

2468.92 --> 2475.88
May and just like kind of go back to

2472.48 --> 2478.319
normal but I'll try to figure out if I

2475.88 --> 2481.599
could like do it

2478.319 --> 2484.44
earlier did the wire break anything the

2481.599 --> 2486.48
I don't know Greg Brunel who knows man

2484.44 --> 2488.04
I've been hearing about more people that

2486.48 --> 2491.839
have had issues

2488.04 --> 2493.92
like that something something may have

2491.839 --> 2497.52
happened but I don't know it's not going

2493.92 --> 2500.52
to be like the eclipse directly I think

2497.52 --> 2501.88
that would be kind of weird maybe it has

2500.52 --> 2505.079
something to do

2501.88 --> 2507.48
with with the uh with CERN being turned

2505.079 --> 2507.48
on or

2507.68 --> 2515.52
something I mean that's a giant magnet

2510.359 --> 2515.52
maybe that I don't know probably not

2527.599 --> 2536.2000000000003
although technically it I mean it broke

2531.92 --> 2538.359
like a day after the

2536.2 --> 2542.0
eclipse

2538.359 --> 2542.0
literally literally

2543.4 --> 2548.079
guys that is kind of weird

2560.359 --> 2564.119
my absence has had a dramatic effect

2562.64 --> 2567.52
what do you

2564.119 --> 2569.76
mean more dramatic than my presence in

2567.52 --> 2569.7599999999998
what

2576.119 --> 2580.1600000000003
sense for

2619.16 --> 2627.64
all right yeah well it's mutual man I've

2624.16 --> 2627.64
really missed you guys a

2633.04 --> 2639.16
lot in a way it is really like I've been

2636.68 --> 2643.2799999999997
just stuck in a

2639.16 --> 2646.3999999999996
box like in solitary unable to contact

2643.28 --> 2649.96
anybody not being able to like just like

2646.4 --> 2651.92
call you up on Skype and just say hi I

2649.96 --> 2655.04
need to talk or something I mean it's

2651.92 --> 2658.2000000000003
been pretty rough for me I'm just lucky

2655.04 --> 2661.359
that I still have my friend in that I've

2658.2 --> 2661.359
been calling like every

2664.24 --> 2670.24
day and she's been really

2667.72 --> 2670.24
gray to

2696.04 --> 2700.0
me e

2753.44 --> 2759.64
right but yeah until now I mean until

2756.68 --> 2762.68
the next time I'm going to have to

2759.64 --> 2765.0
just round it

2762.68 --> 2768.359
out and

2765.0 --> 2769.599
hopefully yeah I'll get some progress

2768.359 --> 2773.16
here

2769.599 --> 2773.1600000000003
and stream

2774.119 --> 2781.599
again soon maybe or maybe it's going to

2778.92 --> 2785.52
take another two weeks minimum before I

2781.599 --> 2785.52
can start doing that

2788.359 --> 2792.319
but I'll probably have like an update

2790.64 --> 2796.04
