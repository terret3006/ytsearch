170.08 --> 174.239
really

172.0 --> 178.76
right

174.239 --> 182.519
so weather today's changed around a

178.76 --> 185.239
bit wind has really died down

182.519 --> 187.72
and even a little bit of sun here and

185.239 --> 190.48000000000002
there in between like this sheep like

187.72 --> 190.48
clouds up

191.159 --> 195.42
there but yeah especially wind going

193.68 --> 199.02
down is a real big

195.42 --> 199.01999999999998
[Music]

204.26 --> 207.54999999999998
[Music]

207.879 --> 214.19899999999998
difference right

211.05 --> 214.199
[Music]

216.599 --> 220.959
yeah hello dupons first in chat H even

219.4 --> 223.95000000000002
before I said

220.959 --> 233.27
hello and Mojo good to see

223.95 --> 233.26999999999998
[Music]

238.68 --> 245.079
you

240.72 --> 248.079
slow my moon buggy sun came back today

245.079 --> 248.079
yeah

249.72 --> 256.519
yes it just kind of

253.2 --> 258.359
shifted last night but it was kind of

256.519 --> 260.759
weird because it was just getting used

258.359 --> 262.88
to like the wind and then when it

260.759 --> 266.16
suddenly

262.88 --> 268.88
stops you feel or I felt the

266.16 --> 271.0
restlessness similar to like when the

268.88 --> 272.039
wind starts blow it's kind of weird it's

271.0 --> 274.24
like

272.039 --> 277.639
what but

274.24 --> 277.639
uh I am

280.28 --> 287.59999999999997
here I got weirdly enough I had like the

284.16 --> 289.56
show number switched up yesterday I

287.6 --> 292.44
didn't have the right

289.56 --> 295.479
number and then today too and I had to

292.44 --> 300.88
like go back and edit

295.479 --> 303.639
it because apparently yesterday I had

300.88 --> 306.12
1856 while I already had that show the

303.639 --> 308.6
day before so that was kind of weird

306.12 --> 311.6
that I hadn't noticed

308.6 --> 311.6
that

315.56 --> 322.72
H something crazy happened on

319.639 --> 324.76
Twitter okay

322.72 --> 326.40000000000003
duper

324.76 --> 329.28
[Music]

326.4 --> 332.75899999999996
what I mean there's all kinds of crazy

329.28 --> 332.75899999999996
things happening on Twitter

344.95 --> 353.61899999999997
[Music]

358.479 --> 364.59999999999997
so

361.24 --> 368.88
and they're working on the road here

364.6 --> 373.8
again this like the third or fourth time

368.88 --> 373.8
now I keep digging up that street

374.52 --> 381.599
there some pipe I I just don't get it

378.8 --> 383.44
like what why do they have to dig it up

381.599 --> 386.52
that many times like there's something

383.44 --> 390.08
going wrong or the changing plans

386.52 --> 391.84
continually I don't get it anyway

390.08 --> 394.94
hello random

391.84 --> 396.71999999999997
Explorer talking of course about

394.94 --> 400.96
[Music]

396.72 --> 400.96000000000004
that a damn it it's right behind

402.96 --> 405.96
it

412.12 --> 416.85
that all

413.76 --> 416.84999999999997
[Music]

418.4 --> 421.4
right

423.69 --> 426.98
[Music]

427.879 --> 432.24
anyway yesterday my birthday show was

429.879 --> 432.24
quite a

432.36 --> 436.68
blast certainly had a lot of

442.4 --> 451.96
activity I think it turned out pretty

445.639 --> 454.759
well sharpened my insight a little bit

451.96 --> 457.75899999999996
further it what's like 3 hours and 20

454.759 --> 457.759
minutes super long

464.159 --> 469.599
show longest I've done in a

467.039 --> 473.68
while normally only reserved for the

469.599 --> 476.68
weekends right anyway yeah Nathan's

473.68 --> 476.68
computer's broken

477.319 --> 484.47900000000004
down uploaded another me only

481.52 --> 486.44
video about how it's basically broken

484.479 --> 490.159
down

486.44 --> 490.159
again has to do with the

491.0 --> 498.199
memory how's the fish oil working out

494.639 --> 500.759
great really well like it is a big

498.199 --> 503.44
difference like concentration wise like

500.759 --> 507.40000000000003
I can literally feel

503.44 --> 511.24
like it's one it's like a a very

507.4 --> 514.68
palpable step up for me

511.24 --> 516.76
right also I've been like I tried I've

514.68 --> 519.519
been trying

516.76 --> 522.519
out different type of

519.519 --> 525.44
EST EST

522.519 --> 529.519
santine which is the bio version which

525.44 --> 533.8000000000001
doesn't yeah it's not like a liquid gel

529.519 --> 537.92
thing but this stuff seems to like make

533.8 --> 537.92
a heavier impact than the other

538.2 --> 541.2
one

541.44 --> 547.8800000000001
like I noticed especially after I took

543.56 --> 547.88
it when I went to sleep just

549.17 --> 552.36
[Music]

552.519 --> 559.079
like Spirit strengthening

556.72 --> 563.76
activity hey steamy traveler good see

559.079 --> 563.76
you what type of fish oil

565.88 --> 570.72
uh royal

568.12 --> 572.279
green

570.72 --> 575.12
just fish

572.279 --> 578.8
oil you

575.12 --> 581.32
know it's not super dark or

578.8 --> 586.8
anything I know that's technically

581.32 --> 588.839
better but I mean it is a bit

586.8 --> 593.68
yellowish that's

588.839 --> 593.6800000000001
good oh didn't see it sorry about

593.8 --> 598.7199999999999
that well at least my we webcam is not

596.839 --> 601.12
continually delaying today that's

598.72 --> 601.12
something

601.16 --> 603.399
all

608.95 --> 612.139
[Music]

614.16 --> 620.92
right probably should buy some yeah

618.6 --> 623.6800000000001
absolutely especially if you like want

620.92 --> 628.04
to be part of this show I mean I

623.68 --> 631.2399999999999
definitely recommend that

628.04 --> 632.3199999999999
cuz I tend to be a little bit taxing on

631.24 --> 636.36
the

632.32 --> 638.8000000000001
mine that's euphemism like I basically

636.36 --> 641.44
demand a lot from everybody and yeah

638.8 --> 643.75
doesn't always work but fish oil is

641.44 --> 646.84
definitely going to

643.75 --> 646.84
[Music]

650.36 --> 656.12
help

652.839 --> 657.0
what used un Rusty enges what are you

656.12 --> 661.04
talking

657.0 --> 661.04
about Ste Traveler

674.46 --> 680.74
[Music]

681.92 --> 687.639
you're not the sharpest knife I wouldn't

684.639 --> 692.36
say that you keep picking

687.639 --> 692.36
out your like my intelligence

697.2 --> 704.12
officer I mean yeah intelligence you

700.6 --> 708.0790000000001
know it it's like quick to understand

704.12 --> 710.839
things but I mean if you just already

708.079 --> 713.12
know a whole bunch of good

710.839 --> 715.72
structures cuz you like learned it early

713.12 --> 717.76
and you're really latched onto it that

715.72 --> 721.48
doesn't even necessarily have to reflect

717.76 --> 721.48
your overall d Dynamic

725.16 --> 730.68
intelligence so my intelligence for

727.76 --> 734.199
example functions very

730.68 --> 737.279
weird it's it is specifically a more

734.199 --> 738.92
Dynamic form of intelligence while just

737.279 --> 741.36
massive amounts of

738.92 --> 743.399
information especially like mathematics

741.36 --> 745.639
it's just

743.399 --> 748.959
like

745.639 --> 751.32
like if I wanted to actually process I'd

748.959 --> 753.4799999999999
have to like completely reset my mind in

751.32 --> 756.8000000000001
ways and I just don't want to do that

753.48 --> 761.04
anymore because it it's such a

756.8 --> 761.04
hassle and I'm not that good at

761.92 --> 764.92
it

765.44 --> 770.8000000000001
so my intelligence how I've trained

768.56 --> 773.88
myself with my intelligence is like how

770.8 --> 773.88
you deal with new

774.32 --> 777.839
information and especially can you look

776.68 --> 780.8389999999999
in

777.839 --> 780.839
between

781.44 --> 786.9590000000001
so and that can yield very interesting

787.6 --> 791.9590000000001
results and it's always something you

789.8 --> 791.959
can

793.94 --> 797.119
[Music]

797.44 --> 802.6
do right but did somebody asked me to

800.0 --> 804.32
like oh yeah just learn how to

802.6 --> 808.279
program

804.32 --> 811.1600000000001
now I'm like yeah but that is kind of

808.279 --> 813.88
tough that's going to be tough on me

811.16 --> 815.68
though so I'm avoiding that because I

813.88 --> 817.639
feel like if I try that I have to like

815.68 --> 820.12
throw everything else

817.639 --> 824.6800000000001
overboard just to be able to focus on

820.12 --> 828.279
that enough to make it through the

824.68 --> 831.12
barriers of like not having a grip at

828.279 --> 833.88
first right unless somebody was there to

831.12 --> 836.9590000000001
actually guide me and there isn't and

833.88 --> 839.759
it's not going to be yeah I'm not going

836.959 --> 841.199
to pretend like there's somebody

839.759 --> 845.92
eventually going to help me with

841.199 --> 845.92
anything like that it's not going to

854.839 --> 858.6
happen that guy was

859.519 --> 863.92
yesterday which guy slow M moon

867.68 --> 870.68
buggy

878.29 --> 883.8
[Music]

879.8 --> 887.04
weird AGM oh

883.8 --> 890.639
yeah I guess he's

887.04 --> 893.0
[ __ ] guess the demon truly did take up

890.639 --> 895.24
house inside of him and he's not fended

893.0 --> 895.24
it

895.839 --> 901.519
off which is really [ __ ] because now

898.48 --> 903.9200000000001
he is Fubar as far as I'm concerned well

901.519 --> 907.72
at first he was just a cranky dude at

903.92 --> 910.519
times and with a lot of

907.72 --> 912.88
feelings but he could come

910.519 --> 915.0
back now I don't see that happening

912.88 --> 916.6
anywhere because now something else is

915.0 --> 919.88
taken house

916.6 --> 919.88
up in

925.199 --> 931.12
there could learn little by little every

928.88 --> 934.0
not to overwhelm your rain yeah but then

931.12 --> 934.0
it's just not going to

939.24 --> 946.0
stick well maybe if there's like a pro

943.04 --> 947.92
like a really a flow chart based program

946.0 --> 950.24
that you like like a course could like

947.92 --> 952.519
teach yourself that would be cool but I

950.24 --> 955.36
mean how long is it even going to take

952.519 --> 959.44
going through that before it actually

955.36 --> 961.6800000000001
amounts to anything that I want to use

959.44 --> 964.48
like I'm not just going to go on some

961.68 --> 966.68
threadmill for two or three years of

964.48 --> 969.04
like yeah just oh and learn this and

966.68 --> 971.4799999999999
learn that and learn that and never ever

969.04 --> 975.16
get to the thing that I actually wanted

971.48 --> 978.72
to learn it for in the first place like

975.16 --> 978.7199999999999
that's the major

981.8 --> 989.8
risk I don't like

985.48 --> 991.9590000000001
programming if I like liked like it did

989.8 --> 994.279
I would have just done that like 20

991.959 --> 994.279
years

994.959 --> 1002.04
ago I didn't like it I actually tried it

997.88 --> 1002.04
for a bit sort of and it's just

1002.6 --> 1007.12
like very quickly I just walked

1015.24 --> 1021.9590000000001
away lot of grps have multiple socks the

1018.68 --> 1025.639
one that oh yeah for

1021.959 --> 1025.639
sure the one

1027.48 --> 1034.199
guy maybe slow it could be it could be

1031.559 --> 1036.559
him it could be other guys that just

1034.199 --> 1039.919
happened to be friends with him or

1036.559 --> 1039.9189999999999
whatever I don't

1045.28 --> 1050.9189999999999
know I mean I have a lot of different

1047.799 --> 1055.6
cranky guys out there that are like

1050.919 --> 1058.44
sending me emails and [ __ ] like every

1055.6 --> 1060.0
day so could be any one of them as far

1058.44 --> 1064.0
as I'm concerned unless you like

1060.0 --> 1064.0
recognized his way of saying

1064.76 --> 1071.4
things he's like very

1067.72 --> 1071.4
British in a certain

1077.4 --> 1084.2800000000002
way

1079.679 --> 1084.2800000000002
don't they just get the AI to do it

1085.919 --> 1088.919
now

1098.7 --> 1102.67

Ground be behind not

1142.44 --> 1147.679

1292.64 --> 1297.88
had a Time years back

1295.52 --> 1300.4
where for a while they thought it was

1297.88 --> 1301.96
funny to like have pizzas delivered here

1300.4 --> 1304.8400000000001
all the

1301.96 --> 1307.4
time that obviously wasn't going to pay

1304.84 --> 1311.84
for so they but that sort of thing in

1307.4 --> 1315.52
pastries and that was weird that's years

1311.84 --> 1318.799
ago I think they in general nobody like

1315.52 --> 1323.279
does it anymore because I lit literally

1318.799 --> 1326.72
never ever order food

1323.279 --> 1329.08
ever like I've not done that one time in

1326.72 --> 1329.08
my

1329.12 --> 1335.84
life So eventually they get the hint

1331.96 --> 1335.8400000000001
like oh for that guy uh

1342.32 --> 1346.52
no but yeah that's pretty freaky

1346.96 --> 1349.96
slowmo

1359.64 --> 1365.0800000000002
oh you actually talk to the spam call

1362.12 --> 1366.8799999999999
Peoples yeah I just end up saying hello

1365.08 --> 1370.12
and then they're just like they freak

1366.88 --> 1372.96
out or they say and then they hang up

1370.12 --> 1375.6399999999999
something or I hang up they

1372.96 --> 1377.64
just I never had a conversation with

1375.64 --> 1380.5590000000002
this SP it's like he every time I

1377.64 --> 1382.3200000000002
actually pick up and say just instantly

1380.559 --> 1384.72
shits his pants or

1382.32 --> 1388.48
something I don't know what it is he

1384.72 --> 1391.52
can't or maybe he's too too triggered

1388.48 --> 1394.6
somehow to be able to have conversation

1391.52 --> 1397.12
maybe it's just autistic level triggered

1394.6 --> 1398.279
he just can't normally communicate when

1397.12 --> 1399.6399999999999
he's like that I don't know what the

1398.279 --> 1403.24
hell he's

1399.64 --> 1403.24
doing but it's a

1406.12 --> 1412.559
he or maybe

1408.679 --> 1412.5590000000002
well yeah

1418.72 --> 1425.6000000000001
whatever right so duper you never told

1421.36 --> 1425.6
us what was so controversial on

1426.24 --> 1431.919
Twitter you said at the

1428.39 --> 1431.919
[Music]

1436.88 --> 1439.88
beginning

1450.76 --> 1453.76
man yeah I'm going

1455.08 --> 1459.12
to I'm going to put my Illuminati CR on

1458.279 --> 1462.6
in the

1459.12 --> 1462.6
oven be right

1466.799 --> 1469.799
back

1496.76 --> 1499.76
I

1521.0 --> 1526.679
back someone impersonated a character

1523.64 --> 1529.679
from Sesame oh

1526.679 --> 1529.679
okay

1531.6 --> 1533.8799999999999
oh

1545.2 --> 1551.3600000000001
wow wow that's crazy duper I hadn't yeah

1548.24 --> 1551.36
that that makes sense

1553.559 --> 1559.08
though that could happen I mean a lot of

1555.96 --> 1560.2
people do like asso iate Elmo with like

1559.08 --> 1562.96
their

1560.2 --> 1565.279
vulnerable side and all that out there

1562.96 --> 1565.279
in the

1579.45 --> 1584.1090000000002
[Music]

1586.6 --> 1592.36
world yeah it didn't hit my feet though

1590.679 --> 1595.799
I

1592.36 --> 1598.52
hadn't crossed my

1595.799 --> 1600.2
Twitter and I do actually browse around

1598.52 --> 1604.0
on it which is a really weird

1600.2 --> 1604.0
realization for me by the

1605.679 --> 1614.72
way that I do that now it's weird

1609.679 --> 1618.6000000000001
because like 10 years ago or 5 years ago

1614.72 --> 1621.76
I would like just look at people people

1618.6 --> 1623.7199999999998
on their mobiles looking at Twitter and

1621.76 --> 1624.679
then talking to somebody about it that

1623.72 --> 1627.0
didn't

1624.679 --> 1628.52
care and that would be happening like

1627.0 --> 1631.799
all the time and I would always be like

1628.52 --> 1636.12
oh my God those people on Twitter oh my

1631.799 --> 1638.0
God and now I'm doing that although I'm

1636.12 --> 1638.9189999999999
not doing it in a freaking mobile that's

1638.0 --> 1643.559
for

1638.919 --> 1646.5200000000002
sure not walking around with

1643.559 --> 1649.72
Twitter but

1646.52 --> 1651.6399999999999
uh because I don't know now there's the

1649.72 --> 1654.24
just slightly more interesting things

1651.64 --> 1654.24
happening I

1655.279 --> 1664.72
guess it's not just all terrible a shw

1660.95 --> 1668.96
[Music]

1664.72 --> 1668.96
crap oh apparently

1669.0 --> 1675.6
uh duer Carlson is interviewing Elon

1672.399 --> 1679.32
Musk oh my God it's

1675.6 --> 1682.399
everywhere Jesus Christ like no [ __ ]

1679.32 --> 1684.8799999999999
way this [ __ ]

1682.399 --> 1690.32
cat this is literally the second time

1684.88 --> 1690.3200000000002
he's done that I'm really [ __ ] DB as

1706.44 --> 1709.44
[ __ ]

1721.96 --> 1724.48
oh he

1724.58 --> 1727.74
[Music]

1730.48 --> 1736.3990000000001
knew open the door he went straight out

1733.559 --> 1739.399
he knew what time it

1736.399 --> 1739.399
was

1746.05 --> 1750.8799999999999
[Music]

1747.96 --> 1753.48
what

1750.88 --> 1757.3200000000002
ELO trauma

1753.48 --> 1757.32
ritual I never liked

1762.159 --> 1769.0390000000002
Elmo it's like too

1765.88 --> 1770.6000000000001
vulnerable like oh I'm vulnerable and

1769.039 --> 1774.0
I'm going to just stay vulnerable like

1770.6 --> 1775.9189999999999
that becomes like a gay effect and it's

1774.0 --> 1778.88
not

1775.919 --> 1781.3990000000001
good it's

1778.88 --> 1783.0800000000002
like it's the same kind of weirdness

1781.399 --> 1785.76
that I associate with like Michael

1783.08 --> 1789.24
Jackson or something like he would just

1785.76 --> 1791.36
have an attitud of like it's like no

1789.24 --> 1794.1200000000001
that's just wrong like you're not

1791.36 --> 1795.7199999999998
supposed to do that you're not supposed

1794.12 --> 1799.2399999999998
to

1795.72 --> 1800.08
yeah pretend

1799.24 --> 1802.279
like

1800.08 --> 1805.36
that I don't

1802.279 --> 1808.36
know the similar Vibe that's why I'm

1805.36 --> 1810.6
Associated Elmo with Michael Jackson in

1808.36 --> 1812.24
ways it's like neither like Michael

1810.6 --> 1816.7199999999998
Jackson had really interesting music

1812.24 --> 1819.2
though here and there cannot deny that

1816.72 --> 1819.2
as's a

1826.24 --> 1833.2
person

1828.279 --> 1838.12
busted for being a creep like my okay

1833.2 --> 1842.6000000000001
wow that slowo is uncanny

1838.12 --> 1842.6
then I had I did not know

1848.0 --> 1852.0
that because it felt the

1854.679 --> 1859.24
same flat birth early cat

1859.72 --> 1865.76
yeah that cat just wants food he is like

1863.08 --> 1865.76
obsessed with

1868.6 --> 1873.9599999999998
it I don't know you'd think he's got

1871.44 --> 1876.159
some kind of parasite that just eats the

1873.96 --> 1880.3600000000001
food out of him or something

1876.159 --> 1885.0390000000002
because he just always wants more it's

1880.36 --> 1885.039
crazy and he like he will eat

1885.919 --> 1892.919
more like I bet that cat could like eat

1889.159 --> 1892.919
an entire can of cat

1893.6 --> 1897.799
food or at least half of it which is

1896.159 --> 1902.3990000000001
already crazy

1897.799 --> 1902.399
amounts and he wouldn't even Flinch over

1902.679 --> 1908.6390000000001
it I probably would he just weird and

1905.72 --> 1911.6390000000001
food obsessed and it sucks it's annoying

1908.639 --> 1914.84
like I can feel how much he is in his

1911.639 --> 1917.76
mind in an Escapist mode basically

1914.84 --> 1922.279
annoying everything in reality in favor

1917.76 --> 1926.24
of just wanting food I can tell like I

1922.279 --> 1926.24
can tell that with cats as I can with

1926.639 --> 1932.12
people and well with cats there's

1929.279 --> 1936.159
nothing you can do about it once they

1932.12 --> 1936.1589999999999
get like that they never change

1936.88 --> 1939.88
back

1943.46 --> 1949.08
[Music]

1946.08 --> 1949.08
anyway

1956.12 --> 1960.9189999999999
Rich right anyway yeah that's

1967.2 --> 1971.919
weird right it wasn't the guy who did

1969.76 --> 1975.559
the Elmo voice somebody impersonated

1971.919 --> 1977.679
them did they like use the puppet and

1975.559 --> 1980.639
everything just like a an Elmo

1977.679 --> 1981.7800000000002
reenactment and that triggered some

1980.639 --> 1983.279
things

1981.78 --> 1987.799
[Music]

1983.279 --> 1987.799
yeah I mean bro

1987.88 --> 1995.3990000000001
there's I tend to ignore it because I'm

1991.24 --> 1997.799
so pissed off over it and I like I mean

1995.399 --> 2001.36
two years ago I was literally screaming

1997.799 --> 2003.76
at the scream it's still there like ah

2001.36 --> 2006.08
like don't do it and and if you're like

2003.76 --> 2007.72
really if you insist well you're going

2006.08 --> 2011.48
to die

2007.72 --> 2015.039
and people were just like oh no stupid

2011.48 --> 2019.0
Arwin and and now and now there's like

2015.039 --> 2021.2
hundreds of thousands millions of people

2019.0 --> 2025.44
that are having all like these death

2021.2 --> 2025.44
experiences with their loved ones

2027.84 --> 2034.4399999999998
yeah and they're finding out it was all

2030.639 --> 2037.0
for a lie yeah yeah oh yeah that's not a

2034.44 --> 2040.3990000000001
that's not a a nice memory to just leave

2037.0 --> 2042.88
in the background is it yeah that really

2040.399 --> 2047.599
nags at you it's called

2042.88 --> 2050.599
Vengeance oh it's so un societal so

2047.599 --> 2052.72
uncivilized yeah but we're better than

2050.599 --> 2055.679
that

2052.72 --> 2060.2799999999997
yeah we'll we'll

2055.679 --> 2060.28
see cuz you're being chewed

2061.119 --> 2065.56
up and

2063.24 --> 2067.0
disintegrated let's see if you're really

2065.56 --> 2070.52
better than let's see if you'll just

2067.0 --> 2072.76
just like snuff it for your form

2070.52 --> 2076.04
principles

2072.76 --> 2079.079
eh see if you just snuff it for the

2076.04 --> 2082.159
form right because I mean we're just

2079.079 --> 2082.159
blatantly being

2085.079 --> 2091.2000000000003
assaulted I can't really say that we are

2088.32 --> 2094.3990000000003
still living in a civilization I mean it

2091.2 --> 2097.48
still has the veneer of civilization and

2094.399 --> 2099.64
structures infrastructures but it's only

2097.48 --> 2103.92
held to together together by people that

2099.64 --> 2103.92
are like just kind of keep doing

2104.76 --> 2112.6400000000003
it but the people who actually get to

2108.96 --> 2115.88
change things and arrange things they

2112.64 --> 2115.8799999999997
they've abandoned

2116.32 --> 2120.88
it and they're delusional at it I mean

2118.96 --> 2123.48
they think that they can abandon it and

2120.88 --> 2127.6400000000003
still retain some inkling of power

2123.48 --> 2130.72
afterward which is idiotic

2127.64 --> 2133.44
makes me want to actually see it all

2130.72 --> 2137.3199999999997
collapse just so they could at the end

2133.44 --> 2139.599
just like look in the corners and notice

2137.32 --> 2141.88
like there's literally nothing in the

2139.599 --> 2144.76
universe you could think of of

2141.88 --> 2147.76
do before you're going to meet your

2144.76 --> 2150.599
inevitable horrific end and like you

2147.76 --> 2153.4
won't even be able to think of a way to

2150.599 --> 2158.2000000000003
make an excuse for it it's that

2153.4 --> 2161.64
blatant right that high high energy

2158.2 --> 2161.64
right before they die

2162.079 --> 2167.28
horrendously because they know at that

2165.48 --> 2169.68
point when everything's already

2167.28 --> 2172.4
destroyed like there's absolutely

2169.68 --> 2175.72
nothing they could think of or even

2172.4 --> 2178.52
attempt to make some delusional this

2175.72 --> 2181.52
excuse to say why it's

2178.52 --> 2181.52
unjustified

2185.72 --> 2188.72
yeah

2192.72 --> 2199.4399999999996
sorry but yeah hey people welcome to the

2196.48 --> 2201.04
trauma Club you asked for it oh you

2199.44 --> 2203.599
thought you were doing the right thing

2201.04 --> 2205.72
for civilization while the people with a

2203.599 --> 2208.119
lot of power are literally like tearing

2205.72 --> 2210.68
it all apart right in front of you you

2208.119 --> 2210.6800000000003
think that

2211.72 --> 2218.68
by just staying civilized that will fix

2215.68 --> 2218.68
it

2219.72 --> 2224.979
all

2221.9 --> 2224.9790000000003
[Music]

2227.119 --> 2232.079
right I mean not being civilized anymore

2230.04 --> 2234.92
doesn't really fix it either but in a

2232.079 --> 2237.04
way it could cuz if you just like put it

2234.92 --> 2241.8
aside

2237.04 --> 2244.599
you for a bit and like get everybody in

2241.8 --> 2247.119
society on the other rail like yeah

2244.599 --> 2248.76
we're actually at War now

2247.119 --> 2252.119
yeah the war is not what we're being

2248.76 --> 2254.8
told we're at War and the

2252.119 --> 2257.52
media is Nazi

2254.8 --> 2260.6400000000003
propaganda and we got to fight this

2257.52 --> 2262.359
until the Nazi propaganda has ended

2260.64 --> 2266.16
that's pretty much the situation where

2262.359 --> 2266.16
we're at right now especially in the

2266.28 --> 2271.2000000000003
Netherlands we're

2268.839 --> 2273.44
there but the Netherland people in the

2271.2 --> 2275.0789999999997
Netherlands on average I think even

2273.44 --> 2277.16
though we have still a lot of Perpetual

2275.079 --> 2279.2000000000003
numpties that like even if if you chop

2277.16 --> 2283.359
their arms off they'll s still think

2279.2 --> 2283.359
it's there's nothing weird going

2283.839 --> 2290.88
on but a lot of Dutch people like really

2287.319 --> 2294.24
do know like yeah this like we're in a

2290.88 --> 2298.04
sort of a civil war situation civil it's

2294.24 --> 2302.72
like a civil Cold War in a way it's a

2298.04 --> 2302.72
civil but it's I mean there's not

2302.76 --> 2307.88
like people bashing each other in the

2305.72 --> 2310.9599999999996
streets or like gangs going off against

2307.88 --> 2314.4
one another for

2310.96 --> 2316.359
control not literally like that but

2314.4 --> 2318.079
there's a lot of Siege going on

2316.359 --> 2322.64
financially and all

2318.079 --> 2325.6400000000003
that and that is typical Cold War

2322.64 --> 2328.64
so people are noticing here and they are

2325.64 --> 2330.72
like well they're trying to at least

2328.64 --> 2333.96
adapt to the

2330.72 --> 2333.9599999999996
realization of

2335.52 --> 2338.52
it

2340.68 --> 2345.64
right but to keep going and pretending

2343.079 --> 2349.319
like we're still in that

2345.64 --> 2352.359
system that we were in 20 years

2349.319 --> 2357.04
ago like if you actually still hold on

2352.359 --> 2357.04
to that then you really are going to

2357.599 --> 2363.92
die I guarantee

2359.96 --> 2367.599
it because in that system taking VES of

2363.92 --> 2370.2400000000002
any sort is still normal

2367.599 --> 2372.44
yeah it's been fully weaponized I'm

2370.24 --> 2375.16
never taking a shot ever again I don't

2372.44 --> 2378.44
trust any of it ever again

2375.16 --> 2380.8799999999997
ever like you can't trust it anymore the

2378.44 --> 2380.88
whole

2381.0 --> 2387.319
system anyway I'm going to get my

2383.079 --> 2387.319
Illuminati C on right

2395.4 --> 2398.4
back

2425.359 --> 2428.359
e

2436.44 --> 2439.76
oh look at it

2440.0 --> 2444.68
[Music]

2441.44 --> 2449.4
beautiful still way too hot though let

2444.68 --> 2449.3999999999996
it cool off while my coffee gets Brewing

2455.319 --> 2458.319
downstairs

2459.44 --> 2468.4
was clear multiple okay

2463.88 --> 2468.4
slowmo right well I'm not I

2469.44 --> 2474.96
look it's like even with it came up with

2473.04 --> 2477.72
own Benjamin too about Michael Jackson

2474.96 --> 2480.68
that was weird but I don't think Michael

2477.72 --> 2483.4399999999996
Jackson was like

2480.68 --> 2485.68
really like a pedo or anything I really

2483.44 --> 2486.88
don't think that I do think that he was

2485.68 --> 2489.44
just kind of

2486.88 --> 2491.079
like had the Peter Pan complex and

2489.44 --> 2494.0
that's very serious it's like his

2491.079 --> 2497.0
emotional life was really

2494.0 --> 2500.4
stuck like that is actually a mental

2497.0 --> 2503.64
like a very palpable form of mental

2500.4 --> 2505.76
illness and it's tragic and it's a bit

2503.64 --> 2508.839
unstable like you never really know what

2505.76 --> 2512.119
happens with that but I don't think that

2508.839 --> 2513.599
he was like sexual at all like the I

2512.119 --> 2517.6800000000003
don't think he

2513.599 --> 2519.52
had it the same way at all like what

2517.68 --> 2522.24
didn't have that kind of

2519.52 --> 2524.68
drive like even the hand on his crotch

2522.24 --> 2527.7599999999998
in the dancing is more like a virtue

2524.68 --> 2531.5989999999997
signal it really was

2527.76 --> 2534.8
it's like you could just compare how he

2531.599 --> 2537.92
did the thing to like how Prince was for

2534.8 --> 2543.0
example the artist forly known as Prince

2537.92 --> 2548.92
whatever right that man was sexual like

2543.0 --> 2552.079
that was like way more Min and real and

2548.92 --> 2553.92
he he wasn't like deranged like that

2552.079 --> 2557.7200000000003
though probably a bit of sex addict it

2553.92 --> 2560.559
was even a theme a bit but but that's a

2557.72 --> 2562.7999999999997
whole different thing right cuz that guy

2560.559 --> 2566.0
is actually sexual like really with

2562.8 --> 2567.52
women and kind of always thinking about

2566.0 --> 2570.559
that sort of

2567.52 --> 2574.64
thing it's very telling it feels very

2570.559 --> 2578.7200000000003
different yeah Michael Jackson no he was

2574.64 --> 2582.68
never thinking about those

2578.72 --> 2585.24
things it's just playing like a kid

2582.68 --> 2589.839
thinking like a kid that's what he was

2585.24 --> 2594.24
doing it's very different so everybody's

2589.839 --> 2594.24
p no he's just a freaking

2600.72 --> 2607.5989999999997
weirdo I mean I I could imagine that the

2603.64 --> 2610.5989999999997
worst it would go is that he would like

2607.599 --> 2612.3590000000004
just feel emotional wanted to hug a kid

2610.599 --> 2615.1600000000003
and then got really emotional and

2612.359 --> 2617.5989999999997
started crying or something right I mean

2615.16 --> 2619.44
that's something that I could imagine

2617.599 --> 2622.4
Michael Jackson to do and that might

2619.44 --> 2624.28
freak out the kid even or that get

2622.4 --> 2625.599
really Nostalgia like and don't

2624.28 --> 2627.52
understand like why are you feeling so

2625.599 --> 2629.839
bad

2627.52 --> 2632.119
and Michael Jackson wouldn't talk about

2629.839 --> 2634.7999999999997
he was typically very

2632.119 --> 2638.599
closed you wouldn't be very talkative

2634.8 --> 2639.76
like me it's always just BL my tongue is

2638.599 --> 2642.28
always on my

2639.76 --> 2644.76
sleeve you

2642.28 --> 2645.92
know so that's the kind of thing that I

2644.76 --> 2648.48
could

2645.92 --> 2651.48
imagine and he did some stupid things

2648.48 --> 2653.8
which is like a childlike stupidity like

2651.48 --> 2656.76
holding that kid over the balcony that's

2653.8 --> 2660.2000000000003
that's child stupidity it's like what a

2656.76 --> 2665.0
kid would do they were just

2660.2 --> 2668.0
rash right so I just I don't see it like

2665.0 --> 2668.0
that

2682.359 --> 2686.7599999999998
castr maybe I don't

2691.599 --> 2698.48
know maybe slow-mo I the point is I I

2696.2 --> 2703.24
don't even know that for

2698.48 --> 2705.92
sure my point is is like I never felt

2703.24 --> 2708.5589999999997
anything about him being like sexual and

2705.92 --> 2710.44
every time it would even like attempt to

2708.559 --> 2713.88
go near that if there's like a beautiful

2710.44 --> 2716.44
woman it would be like almost sexy

2713.88 --> 2718.8
transition and then it would just break

2716.44 --> 2720.7200000000003
off it's like he couldn't get there I

2718.8 --> 2723.88
don't think I think he was like

2720.72 --> 2726.52
chronically asexual in a way that the

2723.88 --> 2729.2400000000002
whole crutch thing was just like oh no

2726.52 --> 2731.92
I'm I'm a I'm one of the guys really I

2729.24 --> 2734.68
can be a like a guy I think it was a

2731.92 --> 2737.44
virtue signal when he did that I really

2734.68 --> 2741.96
do I think he was virtual

2737.44 --> 2741.96
signaling like no I'm an adult

2742.8 --> 2748.04
man

2745.04 --> 2751.68
really I'm sorry if that oh conflict

2748.04 --> 2753.88
with our long constructed databases that

2751.68 --> 2757.8799999999997
in which he is definitely

2753.88 --> 2757.88
guilty I don't know man

2758.52 --> 2763.88
I don't think

2760.319 --> 2766.359
so and I trust my subtle feelings with

2763.88 --> 2770.52
this because this question was there too

2766.359 --> 2773.68
like with my when I had my first

2770.52 --> 2777.44
girlfriend 26 years ago or something

2773.68 --> 2781.04
yeah 26 years ago she was a devout

2777.44 --> 2782.319
Michael Jackson fan and she had lots of

2781.04 --> 2786.0
trauma

2782.319 --> 2788.599
stuff and she was also a fan of Elmo

2786.0 --> 2793.28
yeah it's not you're not making this up

2788.599 --> 2793.28
I'm not making this up I mean it's

2794.4 --> 2798.76
real

2796.119 --> 2801.359
right but I'm just convinced that

2798.76 --> 2802.96
Michael Jackson is like

2801.359 --> 2806.64
not

2802.96 --> 2810.839
predatorial I I really think he isn't

2806.64 --> 2810.839
but he's weird he was

2811.0 --> 2818.04
weird like extremely misunderstood to

2814.64 --> 2818.04
the point where it just become comes

2819.28 --> 2827.28
absurd and he was left to wonder in a

2823.559 --> 2827.28
way too within his

2835.559 --> 2841.559
absurdity Jackson married El's daughter

2838.559 --> 2841.559
R

2841.599 --> 2844.599
really

2844.72 --> 2847.72
huh

2851.559 --> 2856.599
okay I didn't realize

2857.52 --> 2863.2
that probably didn't really

2860.319 --> 2865.68
care I mean I I wouldn't even back then

2863.2 --> 2869.4399999999996
I wasn't really about significance of

2865.68 --> 2874.2
any of that or like symbolic meanings or

2869.44 --> 2877.76
like oh in involved in mind control

2874.2 --> 2881.48
projects or the fre Masons or MK Ultra I

2877.76 --> 2884.119
like when I when I was in my teens I

2881.48 --> 2886.88
like didn't know anything about that

2884.119 --> 2888.88
like anything at all it really scared me

2886.88 --> 2893.2400000000002
and so I like it basically didn't exist

2888.88 --> 2896.52
to me and things like MK Ultra were like

2893.24 --> 2900.2
a very mysterious like

2896.52 --> 2902.839
now many many years of conspiracy

2900.2 --> 2907.16
theorizing Etc and just looking through

2902.839 --> 2909.5589999999997
things over and over again and

2907.16 --> 2912.48
like now I understand like how that

2909.559 --> 2916.119
actually works and like not just what

2912.48 --> 2919.88
they do but how it's supposed to work I

2916.119 --> 2923.839
get that now I had Absol it was all just

2919.88 --> 2927.52
magic to me the my teens so you can

2923.839 --> 2929.04
imagine when then the Jesuit guy came on

2927.52 --> 2933.599
with the

2929.04 --> 2936.92
yeah with basically like

2933.599 --> 2939.44
hallucinatory stuff that was said to be

2936.92 --> 2941.92
like under control and weaponized by a

2939.44 --> 2944.04
secret service like the craziest story

2941.92 --> 2946.559
you could ever imagine and that really

2944.04 --> 2946.5589999999997
pulled me

2950.0 --> 2957.2
in I felt like I was being handed like a

2954.319 --> 2958.88
opportunity like hey you want to be part

2957.2 --> 2963.0789999999997
of like

2958.88 --> 2964.96
a magical secret surface type thing

2963.079 --> 2968.6800000000003
protecting the people from their own

2964.96 --> 2971.799
stupidity I that's he had a really good

2968.68 --> 2974.16
hook for me on that and he and he wasn't

2971.799 --> 2979.0
even fully trying I was really looking

2974.16 --> 2983.0789999999997
for it so but I did not have any context

2979.0 --> 2986.119
of how things worked of how being fooled

2983.079 --> 2987.4700000000003
even properly

2986.119 --> 2988.6400000000003
works

2987.47 --> 2991.5989999999997
[Music]

2988.64 --> 2993.96
like I had absolutely no good defenses

2991.599 --> 2996.079
for it and my parents were not really

2993.96 --> 2998.319
capable of Defending me at at that high

2996.079 --> 3001.28
level because they themselves had barely

2998.319 --> 3001.2799999999997
any knowledge

3001.319 --> 3006.799
themselves over

3003.319 --> 3010.44
that social engineering mind control

3006.799 --> 3012.559
like even now my dad's not a star at it

3010.44 --> 3016.079
I mean he knows it's happening is just

3012.559 --> 3016.079
not really learning the

3016.42 --> 3020.4
[Music]

3018.52 --> 3023.319
details anyway I'm going to get my

3020.4 --> 3023.319
coffee I'll be right

3024.44 --> 3027.44
back

3054.44 --> 3057.44
e

3084.359 --> 3087.359
for

3093.86 --> 3097.099
[Music]

3101.2 --> 3106.04
all right now of course what the jwood

3102.839 --> 3110.0789999999997
guy in that whole

3106.04 --> 3112.5589999999997
seduction grooming scheme like did not

3110.079 --> 3114.6400000000003
mention especially at first is that it's

3112.559 --> 3115.92
like yeah we make a deal with the devil

3114.64 --> 3117.359
it's like

3115.92 --> 3121.359
we throw

3117.359 --> 3123.04
around we yeah basically just that like

3121.359 --> 3126.799
yeah

3123.04 --> 3130.64
we they're anti-christian like really

3126.799 --> 3133.119
like devils and vampiric and it's not

3130.64 --> 3133.1189999999997
just an

3134.4 --> 3141.079
image so as I was like oh yeah I'll I

3138.24 --> 3142.839
want to be one of you guys and I want to

3141.079 --> 3146.559
deal with real magic and I want to

3142.839 --> 3149.68
really understand and and I realize

3146.559 --> 3149.6800000000003
people are really [ __ ]

3149.96 --> 3157.76
stupid yeah even though I wasn't even

3153.4 --> 3160.64
realize how really [ __ ] stupid I was

3157.76 --> 3163.76
being right at the

3160.64 --> 3166.359
time and then eventually it started to

3163.76 --> 3169.8390000000004
dawn on me as I was like already like

3166.359 --> 3173.359
I'm taking this position like

3169.839 --> 3175.4
I'm basically like I'm becoming a wizard

3173.359 --> 3177.48
and I thought like I'm becoming a wizard

3175.4 --> 3179.96
like among these guys I can learn from

3177.48 --> 3182.2
them and then like be of service to the

3179.96 --> 3185.04
world and was

3182.2 --> 3187.7599999999998
really still positive but then started

3185.04 --> 3191.119
realizing like no these people actually

3187.76 --> 3195.119
seem to literally ruins people's

3191.119 --> 3197.4
lives like they scheme to demoralize

3195.119 --> 3202.2400000000002
others good

3197.4 --> 3206.52
people and then I just like I

3202.24 --> 3208.64
got allergic to that [ __ ]

3206.52 --> 3212.7599999999998
and then realized like no that's not

3208.64 --> 3214.0789999999997
something I can tolerate for the long

3212.76 --> 3216.559
[Music]

3214.079 --> 3219.799
run and then I started to realize like

3216.559 --> 3222.799
that it was all an illusion they just

3219.799 --> 3225.319
lied to me about it they pulled me in

3222.799 --> 3226.839
with an illusion and then thought that

3225.319 --> 3229.0
oh they just dropped the mask like yeah

3226.839 --> 3231.359
we're actually just really disgusting

3229.0 --> 3233.96
evil

3231.359 --> 3236.52
people and then they thought that I

3233.96 --> 3238.68
would like give up like they pull in me

3236.52 --> 3242.079
with a dream and then I dro the mask

3238.68 --> 3246.9199999999996
because I just wanted power like they

3242.079 --> 3250.46
really thought that and they like really

3246.92 --> 3253.319
wrong really [ __ ]

3250.46 --> 3260.799
[Music]

3253.319 --> 3260.799
wrong but then yeah you get

3261.0 --> 3267.0
disconnected rejected but still damaged

3264.64 --> 3268.5989999999997
from even knowing that that's there and

3267.0 --> 3273.16
now I know like

3268.599 --> 3277.079
there's people in their entire world is

3273.16 --> 3279.16
just there is in in that world and they

3277.079 --> 3283.319
don't even know there's an entire

3279.16 --> 3287.2799999999997
parallel world that entirely Masters and

3283.319 --> 3292.5589999999997
encompasses that simulated smaller world

3287.28 --> 3292.559
and parasites on it like

3292.72 --> 3300.24
industrially and the people live their

3295.96 --> 3302.799
lives never finding out they having

3300.24 --> 3306.4399999999996
vague conspiracy theories that are

3302.799 --> 3310.48
really out of proportion and unrealist

3306.44 --> 3313.52
like mostly just distracting putting the

3310.48 --> 3317.04
enemies on a pedestal of

3313.52 --> 3320.64
power and just thinking that just

3317.04 --> 3323.119
like Monsters all the time which is not

3320.64 --> 3323.1189999999997
how that

3324.0 --> 3329.64
works

3326.28 --> 3333.7200000000003
and so the the icon that the regular

3329.64 --> 3336.8799999999997
people from that General view use to

3333.72 --> 3341.2799999999997
describe the evil from the

3336.88 --> 3343.92
inside is actually effectively again a

3341.28 --> 3346.799
distraction from how that evil on the

3343.92 --> 3350.119
inside actually

3346.799 --> 3351.88
works it's a distraction that people

3350.119 --> 3354.0
themselves even as they think they're

3351.88 --> 3357.76
doing something about it

3354.0 --> 3360.359
pursue they're actually avoiding it

3357.76 --> 3363.119
because if you have to confront the

3360.359 --> 3365.7599999999998
actual situation it would be so much

3363.119 --> 3369.0
more painful for those individuals and

3365.76 --> 3374.2400000000002
they wouldn't handle it so then they

3369.0 --> 3374.24
just create a pedestal of

3374.839 --> 3380.24
power in which they just imagine that

3377.76 --> 3383.3590000000004
these are like

3380.24 --> 3385.4799999999996
super spooky people that are literal

3383.359 --> 3387.799
vampires or like to

3385.48 --> 3389.92
possessed by a demon all the time and

3387.799 --> 3394.28
that they eat children

3389.92 --> 3396.359
and and more horrific

3394.28 --> 3401.92
things when

3396.359 --> 3404.16
that imagery conjured is the

3401.92 --> 3405.6800000000003
distraction that is conjured by the

3404.16 --> 3408.799
people that are

3405.68 --> 3411.2799999999997
basically into something that they can't

3408.799 --> 3414.24
handle and their subconscious is trying

3411.28 --> 3415.76
to pull them back into the non-reality

3414.24 --> 3419.0389999999998
away from it

3415.76 --> 3422.76
by casting a fake image of who what that

3419.039 --> 3425.0
evil really is for the individual as a

3422.76 --> 3428.7200000000003
distraction from how terrible it

3425.0 --> 3432.0
actually is which is very different much

3428.72 --> 3434.799
worse in a way like the evil is actually

3432.0 --> 3436.839
much more spread out in every

3434.799 --> 3440.64
individual like through the social

3436.839 --> 3440.64
engineering the evil is all in

3442.44 --> 3450.599
US it succeeds so well because it's it's

3447.079 --> 3453.599
rooted in every person so

3450.599 --> 3453.599
deeply

3456.96 --> 3460.28
multi-generationally and that's

3458.359 --> 3461.88
something that even the Jesuit guy like

3460.28 --> 3463.96
taught me at one point and and it

3461.88 --> 3467.559
sounded like actual wisdom it's just

3463.96 --> 3469.92
really painful evil wisdom is that like

3467.559 --> 3474.48
yeah we have this much power

3469.92 --> 3477.599
because people are effectively evil and

3474.48 --> 3480.2
in denial about it and everybody agrees

3477.599 --> 3483.599
there's a consensus about the denial of

3480.2 --> 3485.1189999999997
the evil that is committed by everyone

3483.599 --> 3487.2400000000002
all the

3485.119 --> 3491.079
time yeah and I'm not talking about

3487.24 --> 3495.52
[ __ ] climate change crap which is

3491.079 --> 3499.1600000000003
another projection cover from the actual

3495.52 --> 3503.599
evil that remains unconfronted

3499.16 --> 3503.5989999999997
inside another pedestal

3503.72 --> 3509.2799999999997
created

3506.4 --> 3512.359
to distract away from the real evil it's

3509.28 --> 3515.6400000000003
always create another pedestal with a

3512.359 --> 3518.2
more impressive evil to outshine the

3515.64 --> 3521.0
actual evil so you could forget about

3518.2 --> 3521.0
the actual

3525.88 --> 3529.219
[Music]

3530.079 --> 3533.28
Evil all

3533.319 --> 3537.4
right so that's that's the main

3540.799 --> 3546.16
point

3542.64 --> 3547.5989999999997
yeah and even the common mind would say

3546.16 --> 3548.8799999999997
like what are you doing AR what

3547.599 --> 3552.2000000000003
everybody's

3548.88 --> 3554.599
evil no we're good ones we know we want

3552.2 --> 3557.359
to do better and like it has nothing to

3554.599 --> 3562.079
do with that that's

3557.359 --> 3562.0789999999997
just it's about knowing what is

3562.52 --> 3566.92
what and especially about about that

3565.599 --> 3571.0
mechanism

3566.92 --> 3573.92
of enforcing it enforcing the good

3571.0 --> 3576.72
enforcing God's law yeah there are

3573.92 --> 3581.48
certain things in the Bible that are

3576.72 --> 3583.7599999999998
absolute noo zone for which it is

3581.48 --> 3586.0
described like you have to do something

3583.76 --> 3586.0
about

3586.88 --> 3591.7200000000003
it and nobody does

3591.92 --> 3600.48
cuz the Bible is really more just like a

3596.16 --> 3602.96
shadow a shadow of the past of still

3600.48 --> 3602.96
being

3607.16 --> 3612.44
whole if you don't enforce the laws
