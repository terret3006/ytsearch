tuesday the 7th of december 2021

242.159 --> 245.76

245.84 --> 249.599
because yeah i was

247.519 --> 252.59900000000002
just having a really good sleep this

249.599 --> 252.599
morning

258.079 --> 262.44

269.759 --> 276.08000000000004
weather's terrible over there okay in

272.32 --> 276.08
england it's really cloudy right now

277.44 --> 282.759
i used to hang at the buddhist temple in

279.759 --> 282.759
manhattan

286.4 --> 291.75899999999996
oh i've only like been there one time

289.12 --> 293.84000000000003
and it was really weird i guess kind of

291.759 --> 296.8
inappropriate time even

293.84 --> 298.79999999999995
it was

296.8 --> 301.52000000000004
like seven years ago

298.8 --> 303.68
in one point where i was like

301.52 --> 305.52
totally out of my mind i was so

303.68 --> 308.40000000000003
emotional

305.52 --> 310.639
like i was basically

308.4 --> 311.67999999999995
kind of psychotic at that time where

310.639 --> 314.24
just

311.68 --> 316.40000000000003
totally or more like hysterical not

314.24 --> 318.56
psychotic

316.4 --> 321.039
so i got in there just because i wanted

318.56 --> 323.68
to not feel alone i missed like i felt

321.039 --> 326.8
like i was like like everybody died kind

323.68 --> 329.199
of feeling terrible so i went in there

326.8 --> 333.36
at some i think it was like a

329.199 --> 335.91900000000004
chinese new year ceremony

333.36 --> 339.84000000000003
and then i actually

335.919 --> 339.84
burst out crying which was ridiculous

340.32 --> 344.8
i thought they i i think i kind of

342.4 --> 348.0
annoyed them even with that but whatever

344.8 --> 348.0
it's seven years ago

349.6 --> 353.36
but yeah their temple is and kind of

351.68 --> 354.40000000000003
nice

353.36 --> 356.24
i think

354.4 --> 359.67999999999995
it's like all the walls are covered with

356.24 --> 359.68
like buddha holes

359.84 --> 363.919
i think i'm just going to call them

361.199 --> 363.91900000000004
buddha holes

365.199 --> 368.96000000000004

393.759 --> 400.16
flat earth debates debate was

396.72 --> 400.16
really really great

400.319 --> 406.0
i can't say whether it was because i was

403.759 --> 409.36
not going out for groceries and present

406.0 --> 411.12
there all the time but it might have had

409.36 --> 414.88
some contribution

411.12 --> 417.12
so we were like really on high level

414.88 --> 419.36
added the entire show

417.12 --> 421.599
including after show and adam meekin was

419.36 --> 425.039

446.4 --> 451.31899999999996
rather it's

448.0 --> 451.319
never mind

452.24 --> 454.479
uh

454.72 --> 458.40000000000003
not unless my trainer thought uh what

456.56 --> 463.4
was it talking about

458.4 --> 463.4
yeah yes this flat earth debate great

467.039 --> 469.28
uh

472.639 --> 478.199
nature from australia

475.199 --> 478.199
great

481.12 --> 487.039
uh

483.44 --> 487.039
did he have someone on again

488.639 --> 492.08
let me double check

490.4 --> 493.52
i thought

492.08 --> 495.039
yeah adam meekin

493.52 --> 498.96
right

495.039 --> 498.96
so adam is like making his rounds

502.08 --> 508.639
but yeah that was a

504.4 --> 508.63899999999995
very informative and technical show

509.36 --> 514.8000000000001
over at mitchell from australia so if

511.28 --> 514.8
you haven't seen that check it out

517.519 --> 520.839
great show

525.92 --> 530.0799999999999
i'll link you up

527.6 --> 533.08
if you lost it in the soup of

530.08 --> 533.08
links

534.399 --> 539.6
when is the full fed uh i'm not sure

537.279 --> 541.8389999999999
it's a monday show

539.6 --> 541.839
so

542.959 --> 549.2399999999999
i don't know that i think

545.12 --> 549.24
it's like two days later

549.68 --> 552.0
so that

550.959 --> 552.88
should

552.0 --> 554.959
be

552.88 --> 556.56
wednesday tomorrow

554.959 --> 560.399
in the evening or something i don't know

556.56 --> 562.7199999999999
i'm not entirely sure it all depends

560.399 --> 565.6
i should like ask nathan even like how

562.72 --> 568.9590000000001
is his arrangement schedule planned out

565.6 --> 572.16
exactly or does he vary it a little

568.959 --> 574.2399999999999
because sometimes he doesn't like really

572.16 --> 575.92
when shows are kind of uneventful he

574.24 --> 577.92
doesn't play them a lot and when they're

575.92 --> 580.0
like really good he tends to like play

577.92 --> 581.519
them a couple of times

580.0 --> 584.32
so

581.519 --> 584.32
no colon

584.8 --> 588.3199999999999
hope i'm feeling better yeah yeah

589.36 --> 591.839
much better

596.56 --> 600.3199999999999
oh yeah now remember i also had a

598.48 --> 604.279
another call with

600.32 --> 604.279
my friend from neymar

606.079 --> 613.4399999999999
yesterday night

608.8 --> 613.4399999999999
or well eve late evening early night

616.48 --> 620.399
so apparently like her daughter

620.56 --> 626.64
is now going to a school for the

623.68 --> 629.12
like an actual school for the first time

626.64 --> 629.12
i think

629.76 --> 632.56
not like

630.839 --> 636.0790000000001
daycare

632.56 --> 638.0
and she's like chosen a uh

636.079 --> 639.68
a waltdorf school a horde of

638.0 --> 643.68
steiner-based

639.68 --> 646.2399999999999
so yeah that's very interesting and

643.68 --> 648.64
like i want to keep close track of that

646.24 --> 650.0790000000001
i have of course like have

648.64 --> 652.48
like my youth

650.079 --> 656.3199999999999
experience with that to reflect on with

652.48 --> 657.839
her and basically my tip is like

656.32 --> 659.279
like

657.839 --> 661.44
don't

659.279 --> 663.2
like you have to kind of be like you

661.44 --> 665.44
have to show that you do have like

663.2 --> 667.2
family pride and all that a little

665.44 --> 669.7600000000001
but don't overdo it

667.2 --> 671.6800000000001
don't be like all softy soft but

669.76 --> 673.8389999999999
she's going to naturally be like that i

671.68 --> 676.079
just needed to like basically say like

673.839 --> 678.0790000000001
yeah just

676.079 --> 681.12
that's good the way you are natural

678.079 --> 685.76
probably will work out great over there

681.12 --> 687.68
so don't try to adapt like out too much

685.76 --> 689.92
that was my advice

687.68 --> 691.519
but pay good attention

689.92 --> 694.7199999999999
also to your daughter

691.519 --> 696.48
over the course of time there right

694.72 --> 698.48
of course i don't think yeah there's no

696.48 --> 700.9590000000001
facts [ __ ]

698.48 --> 703.839
anything no masks so that should be

700.959 --> 703.8389999999999
great

709.04 --> 713.68
by the way it's her birthday today

712.56 --> 717.1999999999999
i think she

713.68 --> 719.68
just turned four

717.2 --> 721.6
i don't ex like i

719.68 --> 723.76
it's weird because like every time i

721.6 --> 725.6
think of her daughter it's like nah she

723.76 --> 727.36
should be like five or six because she's

725.6 --> 729.2
like pretty big

727.36 --> 731.279
and so freaking smart it's like that

729.2 --> 734.72
doesn't seem even like a

731.279 --> 734.72
three or four year old but

748.16 --> 752.56
am

750.639 --> 756.32
yeah i'm also thanks for the donation

752.56 --> 756.3199999999999
again i forgot to say yesterday

757.519 --> 760.88
is she your daughter no

763.279 --> 770.56
but i've kind of like i'm like sort of a

767.04 --> 774.399
adopted father friend figure

770.56 --> 775.8389999999999
i'm basically like her mother's

774.399 --> 778.72
call buddy

775.839 --> 781.6
because she is really smart

778.72 --> 785.0400000000001
and very intense with feelings not like

781.6 --> 786.9590000000001
like squeal crazy or anything

785.04 --> 790.0
and she doesn't have a lot of people

786.959 --> 792.16
that kind of understand her and how she

790.0 --> 795.76
is and i'm one of those people and i

792.16 --> 797.519
basically offered to be there

795.76 --> 799.04
like even like when she cracks

797.519 --> 800.88
emotionally or

799.04 --> 803.68
when she's just gone through something

800.88 --> 805.519
really insane again because she for some

803.68 --> 808.16
reason

805.519 --> 810.639
gets surrounded by people that are kind

808.16 --> 810.639
of nuts

811.12 --> 815.6
and then she keeps control over it

814.399 --> 818.48
but yeah

815.6 --> 820.9590000000001
not all it does not always successfully

818.48 --> 823.76
like there's no like serious violence or

820.959 --> 825.4399999999999
anything well not anymore anyway

823.76 --> 828.24
but yeah her

825.44 --> 833.36
ex-boyfriend the father like is it a

828.24 --> 833.36
proper lunatic with violence it's crazy

834.72 --> 841.279
and i don't know the way she grew up

838.16 --> 844.24
she's just like entangled with that so

841.279 --> 845.199
she's almost like desensitized to crazy

844.24 --> 847.44
people

845.199 --> 848.8
she's always like uh yeah but they're

847.44 --> 851.0400000000001
they're crazy but they're still good

848.8 --> 852.24
people inside

851.04 --> 854.399
weird

852.24 --> 857.12
not my stance at all

854.399 --> 858.8
but that's just how she works and she

857.12 --> 861.199
has like

858.8 --> 863.519
fixed people too

861.199 --> 865.12
but only really when they were ready for

863.519 --> 867.839
it

865.12 --> 869.36
and well a lot of people that are nutty

867.839 --> 871.519
that

869.36 --> 873.1990000000001
get on their path like are not ready for

871.519 --> 874.72
it and then she doesn't know how to deal

873.199 --> 875.92
with that part

874.72 --> 878.0790000000001
so i've been kind of like

875.92 --> 880.16
psychologically

878.079 --> 883.279
giving her some guidance and using my

880.16 --> 885.36
arwedian insights to help her

883.279 --> 887.36
get a better grip well basically as a

885.36 --> 890.8000000000001
single mother

887.36 --> 890.8000000000001
in a difficult world now

896.48 --> 899.839
what the [ __ ] david hall

904.8 --> 911.3599999999999
damaged goods no no look

908.16 --> 911.36
i've known this girl

911.6 --> 913.839
for

914.0 --> 917.279
wow

915.519 --> 918.16
15 years

917.279 --> 921.279
yeah

918.16 --> 923.279
way before like she actually was my

921.279 --> 924.8389999999999
girlfriend for kind of a short period it

923.279 --> 928.72
was crazy

924.839 --> 928.72
but yeah no

929.36 --> 931.6800000000001
like

930.32 --> 933.0400000000001
she is

931.68 --> 935.519
really

933.04 --> 938.16
really smart and sharp

935.519 --> 941.519
yeah you're gonna be damaged goods

938.16 --> 943.04
in this freaking world

941.519 --> 945.44
if you're like that

943.04 --> 948.3199999999999
because people can't handle her

945.44 --> 952.72
like people get like spontaneous inner

948.32 --> 955.0400000000001
welling uprage of like bizarre jealousy

952.72 --> 958.24
just because of like the intensity of

955.04 --> 958.24
her energy

963.44 --> 966.8800000000001
yeah it's the secret yeah it's david

965.6 --> 969.6800000000001
hall again

966.88 --> 971.92
weird yeah

969.68 --> 975.279
well david hall's kind of been proven to

971.92 --> 980.519
be partially damaged goods at least

975.279 --> 980.519
heavily desensitized david hall right

982.079 --> 988.4799999999999
her problem is with her ex excuse me

986.24 --> 990.48
excuse me

988.48 --> 992.8000000000001
dude you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

990.48 --> 996.04
talking about i do i've been there kind

992.8 --> 996.04
of like

996.8 --> 999.519
all the time

1000.639 --> 1003.519
like

1001.519 --> 1007.04
through the phone but i'm very well

1003.519 --> 1007.04
informed right yeah her ex

1007.44 --> 1013.0400000000001
is kind of like stable now

1011.44 --> 1015.6
but they're never gonna get back

1013.04 --> 1018.48
together again and she had kind of tried

1015.6 --> 1021.1990000000001
that for way too long because he's just

1018.48 --> 1023.36
he is like out of control

1021.199 --> 1025.6
literally out of control

1023.36 --> 1028.16
super super

1025.6 --> 1031.839
insanely impulsive

1028.16 --> 1034.72
in a bad way so like it's like whatever

1031.839 --> 1037.76
like if you even slow the slightest hint

1034.72 --> 1039.6000000000001
of human response like you don't like

1037.76 --> 1042.559
what you're doing right now you'll get

1039.6 --> 1044.079
completely insane

1042.559 --> 1046.24
a psychotic

1044.079 --> 1048.3999999999999
a genuine psychotic

1046.24 --> 1050.64
terrible

1048.4 --> 1053.44
and he is smart

1050.64 --> 1055.5200000000002
like maybe in the direction of my types

1053.44 --> 1056.799
of smarts but he's just so out of

1055.52 --> 1060.08
control

1056.799 --> 1063.36
it's not coming out he's [ __ ] insane

1060.08 --> 1066.96
and potentially dangerous at times

1063.36 --> 1070.0
and like a chronic savage demonic coward

1066.96 --> 1071.919
like that guy is possessed

1070.0 --> 1074.0
seriously possessed

1071.919 --> 1076.4
seriously might have been

1074.0 --> 1078.84
actually involved with dark magic [ __ ]

1076.4 --> 1080.72
at some point and may literally be

1078.84 --> 1083.12
possessed

1080.72 --> 1084.64
he gets some crazy ideas in his head

1083.12 --> 1085.6
creepy

1084.64 --> 1086.64
so

1085.6 --> 1089.36
yeah

1086.64 --> 1090.72
she doesn't really deal with him anymore

1089.36 --> 1095.3999999999999
and there's like

1090.72 --> 1095.4
legal battles even going on

1097.919 --> 1101.2800000000002
do i know him well no

1105.52 --> 1109.44
the kid should be super smart yeah kid

1108.16 --> 1111.679
is

1109.44 --> 1114.4
like brilliant but that's

1111.679 --> 1116.48
potentially also dangerous like she

1114.4 --> 1120.16
is now already in the face where she's

1116.48 --> 1122.4
literally just scanning people

1120.16 --> 1124.799
to figure out how they are attaining

1122.4 --> 1126.0600000000002
social power

1124.799 --> 1128.559
like really young

1126.06 --> 1129.84
[Laughter]

1128.559 --> 1132.559
so

1129.84 --> 1134.8799999999999
you kind of have to keep i need

1132.559 --> 1138.48
to assist her mother

1134.88 --> 1141.2
or like that daughter might become like

1138.48 --> 1145.28
really messed up it might still happen

1141.2 --> 1145.28
but i have to try something

1145.679 --> 1149.48
i have to like assist

1154.32 --> 1158.1599999999999
maybe feel threatened look

1157.039 --> 1160.48
uh

1158.16 --> 1163.28
my friend and i met her literally now

1160.48 --> 1166.559
has a boyfriend

1163.28 --> 1169.76
okay so i don't think that her father is

1166.559 --> 1169.76
threatened by me

1170.08 --> 1175.6
and by the way a father is like way too

1172.799 --> 1177.36
much of a chronic coward to really care

1175.6 --> 1179.9189999999999
he doesn't

1177.36 --> 1182.08
even care for love anymore he just wants

1179.919 --> 1185.0800000000002
to make people do what he wants in that

1182.08 --> 1185.08
moment

1199.6 --> 1204.1589999999999
wow this female sounds intelligent

1201.919 --> 1205.5200000000002
getting a kid with a guy like that yeah

1204.159 --> 1206.64
well it's a different sort of

1205.52 --> 1207.52
intelligence

1206.64 --> 1209.8400000000001
right

1207.52 --> 1213.36
it's more like talented

1209.84 --> 1215.76
unfortunately lots of talented people

1213.36 --> 1218.6399999999999
can't handle being the way they are so

1215.76 --> 1220.96
on top of their talents they also get a

1218.64 --> 1223.679
big batch of insanity

1220.96 --> 1224.72
that's kind of normal

1223.679 --> 1227.6000000000001
in this

1224.72 --> 1227.6000000000001
[ __ ] up world

1228.08 --> 1230.799
so

1228.96 --> 1234.1200000000001
yeah you don't really know what you're

1230.799 --> 1234.12
talking about

1235.919 --> 1239.2
at four years old yeah

1242.88 --> 1250.0800000000002
he sounds chill no he isn't chill

1246.799 --> 1250.08
and he isn't threatened by me

1250.799 --> 1255.52
well he might be but he knows i'll

1253.919 --> 1258.5590000000002
literally

1255.52 --> 1260.08
totally out dominate him like physically

1258.559 --> 1263.6789999999999
including

1260.08 --> 1266.3999999999999
like i'm not afraid

1263.679 --> 1267.52
like he's physically assaulted my friend

1266.4 --> 1270.96
okay

1267.52 --> 1270.96
very like wounded

1271.28 --> 1273.6789999999999
i

1272.24 --> 1275.919
am not afraid

1273.679 --> 1277.76
like i know like i'm just waiting for an

1275.919 --> 1279.76
opportunity for him to basically

1277.76 --> 1283.559
freaking get himself killed

1279.76 --> 1283.559
because he's a maniac

1290.48 --> 1294.799
you don't know what intelligence is bad

1292.4 --> 1294.799
karma

1302.799 --> 1306.1589999999999

1304.96 --> 1308.72
boyfriend

1306.159 --> 1311.7600000000002

1308.72 --> 1313.679
a problem issue which is like yeah who

1582.0 --> 1584.799
i

1582.84 --> 1587.279
guess

1584.799 --> 1589.44
he couldn't handle the the sensitive he

1587.279 --> 1593.36
couldn't handle actual

1589.44 --> 1595.279
personal inner struggle talk like of a

1593.36 --> 1596.4799999999998
of a single

god

1630.64 --> 1634.72
knew what's gonna happen at some point

1632.32 --> 1636.96
but this

1634.72 --> 1639.1200000000001
this is just

1636.96 --> 1641.1200000000001
i'm really repulsed by this

1639.12 --> 1643.9189999999999
like who the [ __ ] man don't need to

1641.12 --> 1643.9189999999999
repeat myself

1644.159 --> 1647.7990000000002
let's move on

1665.84 --> 1672.6399999999999
yeah yeah like dude toady uk

1669.679 --> 1675.6000000000001
a freaking baller okay

1672.64 --> 1678.48
has more intelligence concerning and

1675.6 --> 1681.799
insight concerning people than you do

1678.48 --> 1681.799
david hall

1682.08 --> 1686.1999999999998
should be embarrassed of yourself

1698.72 --> 1704.84
right well professor phil bell yeah

1701.52 --> 1704.84
that's awesome

1712.48 --> 1716.08
yes i know toady okay i really

1714.32 --> 1717.36
appreciate that

1716.08 --> 1720.32
that yeah

1717.36 --> 1720.32
not forgetting that

1723.52 --> 1729.279
any interest in real telekinesis

1726.96 --> 1730.559
well

1729.279 --> 1733.279
no

1730.559 --> 1733.279
not really

1735.039 --> 1738.399
i mean

1736.159 --> 1739.6000000000001
i still have like telekinetic side

1738.399 --> 1741.52
effects

1739.6 --> 1744.32
it's kind of telling though right i've

1741.52 --> 1745.9189999999999
actually learned to figure out

1744.32 --> 1747.52
what it means

1745.919 --> 1749.8400000000001
when there's like telekinetic side

1747.52 --> 1751.36
effects and when there isn't and what

1749.84 --> 1754.399
that means

1751.36 --> 1754.399
it's fascinating

1754.64 --> 1758.3990000000001
like

1755.679 --> 1760.5590000000002
i only have telekinetic side effects

1758.399 --> 1762.799
because i have no control over it when

1760.559 --> 1765.039
i'm actually really strong

1762.799 --> 1768.32
and then the more conflicted i get the

1765.039 --> 1772.64
more tighten up in that state

1768.32 --> 1772.6399999999999
big telekinetic lashes happen

1774.64 --> 1780.48
but when i'm like weakened and sick

1777.039 --> 1782.24
remember like for example friday then

1780.48 --> 1783.2
there's no

1782.24 --> 1785.76
it's

1783.2 --> 1786.96
totally silent right that's something i

1785.76 --> 1789.44
figured out

1786.96 --> 1791.44
empirically just by paying attention to

1789.44 --> 1792.64
what happens around me in different

1791.44 --> 1795.8400000000001
states

1792.64 --> 1795.8400000000001
so that is interesting

1832.24 --> 1837.52
oh okay

1834.399 --> 1839.84
you dislike so much of it

1837.52 --> 1842.1589999999999
yeah i bet my uh

1839.84 --> 1843.6789999999999
some of my opinions are probably not all

1842.159 --> 1846.72
that

1843.679 --> 1846.72
close to yours

1849.039 --> 1851.84
right

1858.48 --> 1863.559
you misjudged him

1860.559 --> 1863.559
who

1870.48 --> 1874.679
that's

1871.679 --> 1874.679
toady

1882.159 --> 1884.48
right

1884.72 --> 1890.48
yeah well i am not principally so well

1887.519 --> 1892.559
no i am

1890.48 --> 1894.48
by nature

1892.559 --> 1897.12
very unselfish

1894.48 --> 1899.84
but i've basically become

1897.12 --> 1902.8799999999999
practically selfish in ways

1899.84 --> 1902.8799999999999
just to survive

1904.799 --> 1907.6
it's like i have to

1906.26 --> 1909.36
[Music]

1907.6 --> 1913.9189999999999
ensure

1909.36 --> 1913.9189999999999
like without emotions that i survive

1914.799 --> 1920.32
because naturally i'm like i'll just

1917.679 --> 1922.64
like oh i got something i'll just give

1920.32 --> 1925.2
it away make people happy and have

1922.64 --> 1927.519
actually done that [ __ ]

1925.2 --> 1929.44
expecting like that i would immediately

1927.519 --> 1930.88
get it back and that everything would

1929.44 --> 1934.159
become better it didn't work that way

1930.88 --> 1935.679
though right

1934.159 --> 1936.88
but

1935.679 --> 1940.3990000000001
yeah

1936.88 --> 1944.159
i want to share my happy happiness

1940.399 --> 1944.1589999999999
intensely i want to share my

1944.399 --> 1948.8799999999999
my wealth

1945.919 --> 1952.0800000000002
i really do and i i can't allow myself

1948.88 --> 1957.0800000000002
to do it because i can't afford it

1952.08 --> 1957.08
i mean i can share my happiness right

1970.24 --> 1974.88
come over a seeming self well how how is

1972.64 --> 1978.0800000000002
that tony okay i'm seriously like i'm

1974.88 --> 1978.0800000000002
wondering now it's not a

1978.799 --> 1986.399
don't take it as an insult but

1982.0 --> 1988.799
how do i come over as seeming selfish

1986.399 --> 1991.12
can you explain that to me

1988.799 --> 1992.72
like wow

1991.12 --> 1996.4399999999998
hello america's silver patriot by the

1992.72 --> 1996.44
way and anna atkins

2009.44 --> 2015.3600000000001
i judge you based on camera

2012.08 --> 2015.36
and ranty really

2015.679 --> 2019.039
but

2016.64 --> 2022.48
what do you mean just

2019.039 --> 2024.96
by that situation with ranty

2022.48 --> 2027.279
well you had did you realize the entire

2024.96 --> 2030.08
context of that situation i mean i even

2027.279 --> 2030.88
commented about it back then

2030.08 --> 2033.36
like

2030.88 --> 2036.3200000000002
i got the camera from randy

2033.36 --> 2038.799
when ranty was already going astray and

2036.32 --> 2041.039
acting really weird

2038.799 --> 2043.76
you did realize that when he gave that

2041.039 --> 2047.039
to me he basically started [ __ ] on

2043.76 --> 2050.72
me almost on a daily basis through chats

2047.039 --> 2052.24
and through his own freaking streams

2050.72 --> 2055.1189999999997
after that

2052.24 --> 2055.1189999999997
for like a month

2056.24 --> 2060.9599999999996
and [ __ ] talking about me

2059.359 --> 2064.48
and i was like

2060.96 --> 2067.119
almost sorry to have taken it

2064.48 --> 2067.119
at that point

2072.0 --> 2076.0
that's why sometimes they say like yeah

2073.919 --> 2077.5989999999997
i'd rather just smash it right in front

2076.0 --> 2079.04
of the camera and give it back because

2077.599 --> 2082.96
he would just start saying give it back

2079.04 --> 2082.96
give it back to go [ __ ] yourself dude

2084.0 --> 2088.04
why don't you show us your drone

2094.24 --> 2096.6389999999997
anyway

2098.72 --> 2104.16
all right but yeah if you're going to

2100.16 --> 2106.56
judge me by a situation

2104.16 --> 2109.359
or yeah judge me by ranty videos yeah

2106.56 --> 2113.119
that's not gonna give a clear picture

2109.359 --> 2113.119
that's safe to say by now

2115.28 --> 2118.7200000000003
richard cranium i don't even know who

2117.599 --> 2122.3590000000004
that is

2118.72 --> 2122.359
probably for the best

2133.68 --> 2138.72
with my tea and cakes what

2142.32 --> 2145.839
what are you talking about

2145.92 --> 2151.44
what drinking tea while doing a live

2148.8 --> 2155.119
show is egotistical

2151.44 --> 2156.8
i mean i'm sort of having a class

2155.119 --> 2158.56
you never had a teacher that had just a

2156.8 --> 2160.4
cup of tea on their desk

2158.56 --> 2163.96
like what

2160.4 --> 2163.96
i don't get it

2173.2 --> 2176.8799999999997
okay you can get out of here

2179.76 --> 2182.7200000000003
looks like another beautiful day on the

2181.44 --> 2184.56
flat lane

2182.72 --> 2186.56
yeah indeed

2184.56 --> 2188.16
and we even got a little bit of sun here

2186.56 --> 2190.0789999999997
although it seems that it's gonna

2188.16 --> 2192.56
probably go away

2190.079 --> 2194.96
unfortunately soon

2192.56 --> 2197.96
but then the sun does go under very

2194.96 --> 2197.96
quickly

2201.04 --> 2207.119
i caught a couple of nice beams of sun

2203.68 --> 2207.1189999999997
this morning so that was nice

2207.839 --> 2212.68
oh

2209.68 --> 2212.68
wait

2225.44 --> 2229.56
yeah teacher that's right

2244.64 --> 2251.1189999999997
the lack of dialogue makes the pearson

2247.28 --> 2251.119
speaking seem self-centered

2251.28 --> 2256.8
but i literally interact with chat the

2253.839 --> 2258.96
chat is visible

2256.8 --> 2262.2400000000002
even if the youtube chat would be taken

2258.96 --> 2262.2400000000002
down so i don't get it

2265.92 --> 2271.2000000000003
what i should just be blabbering in a

2268.079 --> 2273.6800000000003
room with other people so i yeah

2271.2 --> 2275.52
have less time to actually talk is that

2273.68 --> 2277.7599999999998
how a class works

2275.52 --> 2279.599
it's like no no the students need to be

2277.76 --> 2280.88
able to talk more

2279.599 --> 2283.88
what

2280.88 --> 2283.88
no

2302.64 --> 2305.359
i thought this was more of a self-help

2304.56 --> 2308.24
group

2305.359 --> 2311.24
yeah also

2308.24 --> 2311.24
indeed

2313.119 --> 2316.6400000000003
you can't be a teacher in that

2318.56 --> 2323.92
i provide all kinds of

2321.28 --> 2324.88
dynamics

2323.92 --> 2328.2400000000002
from

2324.88 --> 2329.76
personal tips and health advice

2328.24 --> 2331.9199999999996
to

2329.76 --> 2334.5600000000004
psychology issues

2331.92 --> 2336.7200000000003
to like dealing with psychological

2334.56 --> 2338.24
abnormalities dealing with world

2336.72 --> 2340.8799999999997
situation

2338.24 --> 2345.2
and then there is the mechanics

2340.88 --> 2347.839
of cosmogeny and physics

2345.2 --> 2350.16
yeah all of it

2347.839 --> 2352.839
and of course even

2350.16 --> 2355.5989999999997
story play

2352.839 --> 2358.48
movies story building world building

2355.599 --> 2359.6800000000003
storytelling it's also part of my

2358.48 --> 2362.2400000000002
teaching

2359.68 --> 2362.24
all of it

2366.8 --> 2370.5600000000004
esoterics

2369.44 --> 2374.8
like

2370.56 --> 2377.839
spirit mechanics is part of my teaching

2374.8 --> 2382.52
i basically invented the word yeah

2377.839 --> 2382.52
our wind trademark spirit mechanics

2384.24 --> 2390.4799999999996
that's my field yeah i'm a freaking

2386.64 --> 2390.48
teacher in that because i basically

2390.56 --> 2394.72
discovered

2391.92 --> 2398.0
literally the word discovered because it

2394.72 --> 2400.3999999999996
was always there i just kind of like

2398.0 --> 2403.04
showed that there is a cohesion and a

2400.4 --> 2406.1600000000003
structure literally yeah i discovered

2403.04 --> 2408.0
that it's my field literally my field

2406.16 --> 2410.0789999999997
other people talk

2408.0 --> 2414.48
in similar directions right rudolf

2410.079 --> 2414.48
steiner had a good grip on it

2414.88 --> 2418.4
i'm deepening the field

2416.88 --> 2419.839
i'm taking it

2418.4 --> 2422.64
to a level

2419.839 --> 2425.359
where i believe that like everybody can

2422.64 --> 2427.68
eventually get it

2425.359 --> 2429.92
learn to deal with it utilize the good

2427.68 --> 2432.0
things from it

2429.92 --> 2435.56
find their way through this crazy world

2432.0 --> 2435.56
thanks to it

2444.0 --> 2448.88
oh you're just here to view as a viewer

2446.96 --> 2452.599
joe this hot stepper well in that case

2448.88 --> 2452.599
donate to my paypal

2477.76 --> 2482.7200000000003
yeah professor phil but that's not how

2479.44 --> 2482.7200000000003
the inner ear works though

2483.52 --> 2487.119
you don't give people money to people

2485.599 --> 2488.2400000000002
online

2487.119 --> 2490.6400000000003
okay

2488.24 --> 2493.9199999999996
you're just a spectator then

2490.64 --> 2496.48
just useless spectator oh look a person

2493.92 --> 2498.88
oh oh that's weird

2496.48 --> 2500.48
so you're just wasting your time then

2498.88 --> 2503.92
should you do something productive with

2500.48 --> 2506.56
your life instead joe the hot stepper

2503.92 --> 2509.7200000000003
like learn a skill

2506.56 --> 2509.72
for example

2517.2 --> 2521.52
so what are you doing here then if

2519.2 --> 2523.2799999999997
you're just spectating not doing

2521.52 --> 2525.2
anything

2523.28 --> 2526.8
if you're not here to learn the skills

2525.2 --> 2530.3999999999996
that i have to offer

2526.8 --> 2532.6400000000003
then what the [ __ ] are you doing here

2530.4 --> 2535.92
just being a numpty on the fence looking

2532.64 --> 2537.359
staring like that's gonna do something

2535.92 --> 2540.16
it isn't

2537.359 --> 2543.04
it's just gonna get you banned

2540.16 --> 2545.839
because it annoys me

2543.04 --> 2548.8
i don't like people that stare at me and

2545.839 --> 2551.44
don't get anything out of it just like

2548.8 --> 2553.6800000000003
oh look at the weirdo oh

2551.44 --> 2556.16
yeah that's because you're stupid you

2553.68 --> 2559.1189999999997
don't have the talent to actually see

2556.16 --> 2560.24
what the [ __ ] i'm doing in order to

2559.119 --> 2563.2400000000002
use

2560.24 --> 2563.24
that

2568.8 --> 2572.8
all right okay joe does that hot stamper

2571.44 --> 2575.359
dude

2572.8 --> 2578.4
follow my show just

2575.359 --> 2580.48
stay out of the chat okay

2578.4 --> 2582.4
if you're not gonna support me

2580.48 --> 2584.56
if you're not gonna be learning

2582.4 --> 2588.599
watch my show that's fine just stay out

2584.56 --> 2588.599
of my chat all right

2600.72 --> 2603.72
ah

2608.88 --> 2615.1600000000003
all right

2611.2 --> 2615.16
oh man time is flying

2629.44 --> 2634.119
yeah nobody cares tony okay

2634.4 --> 2638.599
he's banned that's what he is

2667.28 --> 2671.76
you heard flattery oh well you were very

2669.599 --> 2674.56
ill-informed tony okay that doesn't

2671.76 --> 2676.6400000000003
surprise me at all

2674.56 --> 2678.24
i mean you hang around with complete

2676.64 --> 2682.0789999999997
degenerates

2678.24 --> 2683.7599999999998
complete degenerate willful gleeful

2682.079 --> 2686.88
liars

2683.76 --> 2689.6800000000003
so yeah no [ __ ] oh flutters is over oh

2686.88 --> 2692.7200000000003
wow and you actually believe that tony

2689.68 --> 2695.2799999999997
okay you believed that [ __ ] that makes

2692.72 --> 2695.2799999999997
you dumb

2696.96 --> 2701.119
because you're just

2698.56 --> 2705.64
taking straight out liars

2701.119 --> 2705.6400000000003
on their word that's really stupid

2714.88 --> 2722.6400000000003
what you say spirit mechanics would that

2718.079 --> 2722.6400000000003
also incorporate q i what

2727.92 --> 2733.2000000000003
you mean iq

2730.64 --> 2736.56
mister i don't pay attention to what i'm

2733.2 --> 2740.24
typing before i press enter

2736.56 --> 2740.24
no it doesn't incorporate iq

2741.52 --> 2746.079
it's pure

2743.359 --> 2747.359
sensory

2746.079 --> 2749.599
cannot be

2747.359 --> 2752.24
expressed in

2749.599 --> 2756.0
like mathematics

2752.24 --> 2757.7599999999998
it's much more in the direction of

2756.0 --> 2760.64
social intuition

2757.76 --> 2763.92
like things you pick up in others

2760.64 --> 2765.44
that you can't just

2763.92 --> 2768.64
like it's not something that's like

2765.44 --> 2772.16
visible you only feel it right that

2768.64 --> 2772.16
falls under spirit mechanics

2773.68 --> 2779.2799999999997
you mean

2774.96 --> 2780.96
quantum interaction okay

2779.28 --> 2783.119
what

2780.96 --> 2783.119
no

2783.28 --> 2788.7200000000003
let me say this

2785.44 --> 2793.04
if there's some field out there with the

2788.72 --> 2796.9599999999996
word quantum in it it's [ __ ] [ __ ]

2793.04 --> 2800.96
quantum is all the new sci-fi rage word

2796.96 --> 2802.8
it has [ __ ] to do with anything

2800.96 --> 2806.96
it's just

2802.8 --> 2808.319
the latest sci-fi word

2806.96 --> 2810.64
yeah

2808.319 --> 2813.359
nothing out there that actually has the

2810.64 --> 2816.48
word quantum in it has anything to do

2813.359 --> 2819.839
with quantum mechanics at all it's

2816.48 --> 2822.8
[ __ ] it's just a fad it's a hype

2819.839 --> 2822.7999999999997
it's [ __ ]

2822.88 --> 2829.8
i know i don't even have to hear you out

2826.079 --> 2829.8
i know it

2846.24 --> 2850.8799999999997
quantum computing complete [ __ ]

2851.599 --> 2855.839
quantum entanglement

2853.599 --> 2859.1600000000003
[ __ ]

2855.839 --> 2859.16
it's all [ __ ]

2860.24 --> 2865.68
it's all theoretical garbage

2863.359 --> 2867.92
based on misassumptions

2865.68 --> 2873.0789999999997
what's going on in the original quantum

2867.92 --> 2873.079
mechanics experiments all of it

2874.64 --> 2880.4
the time traveling show quantum leap

2876.64 --> 2880.4
yeah but that show was was funny

2880.559 --> 2884.88
absolutely nothing to do with quantum of

2882.4 --> 2887.839
course but

2884.88 --> 2888.88
like quantum leap

2887.839 --> 2891.2799999999997
is

2888.88 --> 2895.28
did you know that's just a popular

2891.28 --> 2896.96
expression it it doesn't even officially

2895.28 --> 2898.4
by the root

2896.96 --> 2901.119
have anything to do with quantum

2898.4 --> 2904.88
mechanics openly

2901.119 --> 2904.88
quantum leap is a saying

2904.96 --> 2909.2
it's like

2906.559 --> 2910.48
taking a big step

2909.2 --> 2912.72
into

2910.48 --> 2914.559
the unknown from the perspective from

2912.72 --> 2917.2799999999997
where you're taking the step but you

2914.559 --> 2919.92
have to go has nothing to do with

2917.28 --> 2921.6800000000003
quantum computing of quantum

2919.92 --> 2927.16
mechanics or anything

2921.68 --> 2927.16
d-wave computers turned amd what

2929.44 --> 2934.2400000000002
well look i don't believe in quantum

2931.839 --> 2937.52
computing at all i believe that they've

2934.24 --> 2939.839
just figured out like a new depth

2937.52 --> 2941.839
a new working level

2939.839 --> 2943.68
like they switched to the light

2941.839 --> 2945.839
mechanics or something

2943.68 --> 2947.9199999999996
on the microscopic level really weird i

2945.839 --> 2950.88
don't know i don't know the engineering

2947.92 --> 2953.52
of like what they're doing in

2950.88 --> 2955.76
computer chip development

2953.52 --> 2958.16
but it has absolutely [ __ ] to do with

2955.76 --> 2961.28
quantum mechanics [ __ ]

2958.16 --> 2961.2799999999997
absolutely nothing

2966.64 --> 2970.7999999999997
t-wave was a fraud huh

2968.88 --> 2972.96
wow

2970.8 --> 2975.76
well

2972.96 --> 2977.92
i'm not that surprised about it i didn't

2975.76 --> 2980.7200000000003
know that yet actually i'm just seeing

2977.92 --> 2983.76
as like oh quantum computing it's just

2980.72 --> 2986.48
faster computers and a blabber story on

2983.76 --> 2988.96
top oh look we have the special magical

2986.48 --> 2991.28
quantum of it no it's just a really

2988.96 --> 2995.319
[ __ ] faster chance that's it it's all

2991.28 --> 2995.3190000000004
[ __ ] all of it

2998.48 --> 3001.48
huh

3025.68 --> 3028.96
an empty black box

3035.52 --> 3040.8
corny rose okay

3038.4 --> 3043.44
is that that has probably a relation to

3040.8 --> 3045.92
like the d-wave computer i don't know

3043.44 --> 3048.48
the name doesn't sing it ring a bell i

3045.92 --> 3050.48
mean i heard of like d-wave fakely in

3048.48 --> 3052.72
the distance and i know that people were

3050.48 --> 3054.559
getting over-hyped i wasn't even

3052.72 --> 3055.68
interested because i already kind of

3054.559 --> 3056.6400000000003
knew

3055.68 --> 3059.04
like

3056.64 --> 3059.92
this is nonsense

3059.04 --> 3063.44
like

3059.92 --> 3065.599
the story to explain quantum computing

3063.44 --> 3068.4
is nonsense

3065.599 --> 3070.1600000000003
it's about as cohesive as dielectric

3068.4 --> 3071.44
acceleration theory

3070.16 --> 3073.44
serious

3071.44 --> 3076.0
it's like nonsense

3073.44 --> 3077.839
and if you don't get a grip

3076.0 --> 3079.76
then you don't see it then it's like oh

3077.839 --> 3081.2
that sounds really

3079.76 --> 3083.3590000000004
interesting

3081.2 --> 3085.52
yeah that's it it sounds really

3083.359 --> 3089.319
interesting does it make sense no

3085.52 --> 3089.319
absolutely not

3100.0 --> 3105.92
does it have any cross over to qi no

3103.76 --> 3105.92
no

3107.119 --> 3114.559
no spirit mechanics is about

3110.64 --> 3117.04
frequency state of being how information

3114.559 --> 3118.2400000000002
arriving from god as all information

3117.04 --> 3120.5589999999997
does

3118.24 --> 3122.64
how it manifests and how your

3120.559 --> 3125.52
consciousness responds to the

3122.64 --> 3127.2
information through the atmosphere the

3125.52 --> 3129.04
energy atmosphere

3127.2 --> 3130.48
social atmosphere of the general

3129.04 --> 3132.48
situation

3130.48 --> 3135.04
and how it changes

3132.48 --> 3137.76
a lot of spirit mechanics is how does

3135.04 --> 3140.4
the consciousness and your perception of

3137.76 --> 3144.0
reality itself change what are the

3140.4 --> 3147.599
structural patterns of these changes

3144.0 --> 3149.119
that is a lot about it's basically

3147.599 --> 3151.52
a framework

3149.119 --> 3154.2400000000002
a more stable framework

3151.52 --> 3156.64
within psychology spirit mechanics is

3154.24 --> 3159.839
kind of like psychology based

3156.64 --> 3162.0
but it it becomes well structural much

3159.839 --> 3166.0789999999997
more structural and it it basically

3162.0 --> 3167.68
supersedes original psychiatric ideas

3166.079 --> 3170.559
that are soulless

3167.68 --> 3171.68
that are purely materialistic right

3170.559 --> 3174.48
i take

3171.68 --> 3176.5589999999997
that [ __ ] and just shove it

3174.48 --> 3179.359
in the in the abyss

3176.559 --> 3181.2000000000003
and say no no there is god oh yeah

3179.359 --> 3184.0
and they draw everything else that that

3181.2 --> 3187.839
left out in there and then spirit

3184.0 --> 3190.72
mechanics reveal themselves right other

3187.839 --> 3192.64
people talk spirit mechanics they don't

3190.72 --> 3196.0789999999997
even know

3192.64 --> 3198.16
i that it has a name now thanks to me

3196.079 --> 3201.2000000000003
they probably don't care but like owen

3198.16 --> 3204.24
benjamin talks spirit mechanics

3201.2 --> 3204.24
right a lot

3205.119 --> 3208.88
and

3206.079 --> 3211.76
made by jim bob talk spirit mechanics

3208.88 --> 3213.599
like in his own way like even alex jones

3211.76 --> 3216.48
talks about spirit mechanics now it's

3213.599 --> 3219.2000000000003
very colored it's kind of like muddy the

3216.48 --> 3220.64
waters there therefore the frequency but

3219.2 --> 3223.2
he still does it

3220.64 --> 3225.44
spirit talk about spirit mechanics is

3223.2 --> 3225.4399999999996
like

3225.76 --> 3228.48
finding some momentum out there in the

3227.599 --> 3230.8
world

3228.48 --> 3235.88
people are recognizing its power and its

3230.8 --> 3235.88
value that they actually that it helps

3237.52 --> 3243.28
because

3239.04 --> 3247.04
it's like the ultimate counter against

3243.28 --> 3250.28
just systemic confusion being zoned

3247.04 --> 3253.68
derangement derailing desensitization

3250.28 --> 3257.6800000000003
normalization it's the counter to that

3253.68 --> 3260.3999999999996
because it provides insight and cohesion

3257.68 --> 3262.3999999999996
a grip on things that are kind of

3260.4 --> 3264.88
elusive

3262.4 --> 3266.64
if you don't do it right if you don't

3264.88 --> 3268.8
even realize it's there

3266.64 --> 3271.2
then it just seems like wow it just

3268.8 --> 3273.04
happens you know right yeah because you

3271.2 --> 3276.9199999999996
don't feel it you don't understand

3273.04 --> 3276.92
what's happening and how

3282.24 --> 3288.9599999999996
yeah professor fill bell that is

3285.2 --> 3292.839
complete sci-fi mumbo jumbo it is it's

3288.96 --> 3292.839
sci-fi mumbo jumbo

3295.599 --> 3301.92
you watch alex what you do today

3299.68 --> 3305.359
be careful with that dude

3301.92 --> 3308.4
like i mean if you're not like solid

3305.359 --> 3311.52
you're gonna be like dude alex jones

3308.4 --> 3314.0
like unleashes nightmares on people

3311.52 --> 3314.0
a lot

3317.119 --> 3322.0
sometimes he even still kinda gets to me

3319.76 --> 3324.2400000000002
by accident

3322.0 --> 3324.24
but

3325.04 --> 3330.16
dude if you believe it's a globe and you

3327.44 --> 3330.16
watch alex

3331.28 --> 3335.599
like his programming is going to reach

3333.04 --> 3338.96
much deeper because you don't see it

3335.599 --> 3341.3590000000004
you don't see it you don't see the roots

3338.96 --> 3341.359
anyway

3347.68 --> 3351.44
we are doing it in a lab

3354.559 --> 3358.079
where do you think i get my info from

3356.799 --> 3360.24
okay

3358.079 --> 3364.7200000000003
huh

3360.24 --> 3364.72
all right just so have i

3367.76 --> 3372.3590000000004
they're like almost 15 years now

3376.64 --> 3381.44
yeah well look tony okay you're doing it

3379.76 --> 3384.3190000000004
in the lab or you're quantum computing

3381.44 --> 3386.7200000000003
in lab right so

3384.319 --> 3389.2
the quantum thing

3386.72 --> 3392.3999999999996
is just a description of a process that

3389.2 --> 3392.3999999999996
has nothing to do with that

3393.119 --> 3399.6800000000003
oh so you had a a chip

3395.92 --> 3402.839
that seems to be just bit based

3399.68 --> 3404.64
and then you manage to kind of like

3402.839 --> 3407.2799999999997
cause

3404.64 --> 3408.16
super calculation somehow

3407.28 --> 3412.079
right

3408.16 --> 3412.0789999999997
that seems like just a wizard trick

3414.48 --> 3419.52
like i don't know

3416.0 --> 3422.96
yeah i have to have that like pretty

3419.52 --> 3424.64
detailed demonstrated to me

3422.96 --> 3426.799
then i probably figure out like what's

3424.64 --> 3429.7599999999998
going on but like that has nothing to do

3426.799 --> 3434.319
with quantum it's it's still just

3429.76 --> 3436.48
it can only ever be calculation

3434.319 --> 3438.4
using the bit system now maybe they

3436.48 --> 3441.119
found a way to like

3438.4 --> 3443.599
make it so fast

3441.119 --> 3446.88
the electric switching

3443.599 --> 3449.04
that you don't even detect it anymore

3446.88 --> 3451.44
right

3449.04 --> 3455.04
just like a a car wheel when you drive

3451.44 --> 3456.2400000000002
really fast it just seems

3455.04 --> 3458.5589999999997
like this

3456.24 --> 3462.799
blurred up thing

3458.559 --> 3462.799
but it's just turning really really fast

3466.0 --> 3470.88
oh is quantum computing expert no i'm

3468.48 --> 3472.799
not an expert [ __ ]

3470.88 --> 3475.599
that's why i'm asking that's why i'm

3472.799 --> 3478.559
asking for more details and i have a

3475.599 --> 3481.76
suspicion of what it is i just know

3478.559 --> 3484.3190000000004
that the idea of quantum computing

3481.76 --> 3487.0400000000004
has to be nonsense

3484.319 --> 3489.839
like the entire premise doesn't make any

3487.04 --> 3489.839
sense

3490.559 --> 3495.3590000000004
yeah dude get the [ __ ] out

3496.0 --> 3503.28
lay down or shut the [ __ ] up

3499.76 --> 3505.6800000000003
give the info or [ __ ] off

3503.28 --> 3508.6400000000003
i don't need your whining oh you just

3505.68 --> 3511.1189999999997
don't understand you [ __ ] off then

3508.64 --> 3514.839
make me understand then [ __ ]

3511.119 --> 3514.839
don't start whining

3523.28 --> 3528.4
all states between one and z yeah but

3525.2 --> 3531.1189999999997
that that doesn't make sense

3528.4 --> 3534.96
that's there is no state between one and

3531.119 --> 3534.96
zero that's the entire point

3539.76 --> 3544.76
it's just nonsense in plain sight

3545.52 --> 3549.119
how can you register

3548.16 --> 3551.68
yeah

3549.119 --> 3554.2400000000002
it's a switchboard that's what chips are

3551.68 --> 3557.1189999999997
switchboard electronic switchboards how

3554.24 --> 3561.68
can you register

3557.119 --> 3562.559
a specific state somewhere in between

3561.68 --> 3563.7599999999998
on

3562.559 --> 3566.559
and off

3563.76 --> 3570.96
that makes no [ __ ] sense

3566.559 --> 3571.76
the premise for the idea makes no sense

3570.96 --> 3573.28
no

3571.76 --> 3575.5200000000004
sense

3573.28 --> 3578.3190000000004
now if it's just really freaking

3575.52 --> 3581.119
amazingly quick quicker that you can't

3578.319 --> 3582.72
even perceive what's going on

3581.119 --> 3584.88
that's another matter

3582.72 --> 3588.0789999999997
like my comparison

3584.88 --> 3588.88
very quickly spinning wheel

3588.079 --> 3592.4
right

3588.88 --> 3594.799
the speed might simply elude sensory

3592.4 --> 3597.92
that doesn't mean it's actually a

3594.799 --> 3600.92
spectrum in between one and zero that's

3597.92 --> 3600.92
[ __ ]

3616.24 --> 3623.1189999999997
yeah that's literally a paradoxical

3619.359 --> 3625.68
statement what you said there today okay

3623.119 --> 3628.48
it deals all with all the possibilities

3625.68 --> 3632.319
of a state that's not a state

3628.48 --> 3634.72
[Music]

3632.319 --> 3638.68
sounds brilliant if you're into

3634.72 --> 3638.68
technobabble nonsense

3654.839 --> 3659.92
uh but yeah it's interesting that it's

3658.319 --> 3662.72
brought up

3659.92 --> 3664.48
it is technobabble nonsense like it

3662.72 --> 3667.359
if you literally

3664.48 --> 3669.599
dissect such sentences

3667.359 --> 3673.2799999999997
like what he just said

3669.599 --> 3674.4
it deals with all the possibilities of a

3673.28 --> 3676.0
state

3674.4 --> 3679.2400000000002
that's not

3676.0 --> 3679.24
a state

3680.5 --> 3687.72
[Music]

3684.72 --> 3687.72
right

3687.839 --> 3692.799
now let's dissect that logically shall

3690.559 --> 3692.799
we

3694.0 --> 3699.2
dealing

3695.2 --> 3702.0789999999997
possibilities things that are possible

3699.2 --> 3704.3999999999996
of a state it's a condition right a

3702.079 --> 3706.079
condition of the object it's technology

3704.4 --> 3709.2000000000003
a state

3706.079 --> 3709.2000000000003
that's not a

3710.839 --> 3715.7599999999998
state what does that even mean

3714.4 --> 3718.88
how can

3715.76 --> 3722.1600000000003
a technological device have a state

3718.88 --> 3724.2400000000002
that's not a state how would you know it

3722.16 --> 3727.24
it makes no freaking sense it's

3724.24 --> 3727.24
technobabble

3745.2 --> 3749.5989999999997
what part of that says dude if you're

3747.359 --> 3752.96
not getting it

3749.599 --> 3752.96
there's nothing i can do for you

3753.2 --> 3757.839
it deals with a state that is not a

3755.839 --> 3760.16
state

3757.839 --> 3760.16
okay

3761.92 --> 3765.44
that's like

3763.119 --> 3765.44
okay

3765.52 --> 3769.359
you got the blue pill

3767.44 --> 3771.44
and you got the red pill

3769.359 --> 3773.68
what are you gonna choose i'll take the

3771.44 --> 3776.0
yellow one

3773.68 --> 3776.0
okay

3776.16 --> 3778.0
uh

3776.71 --> 3779.2
[Music]

3778.0 --> 3782.92
yeah

3779.2 --> 3782.9199999999996
that's what that is

3802.88 --> 3806.96
a lot of different possible yeah but

3804.319 --> 3809.0389999999998
they aren't possibilities because it's

3806.96 --> 3811.52
not a state

3809.039 --> 3815.6800000000003
the states that aren't states are not

3811.52 --> 3815.68
states they are not a thing

3816.079 --> 3821.7200000000003
you see

3817.44 --> 3821.7200000000003
it's literally nonsense

3834.96 --> 3841.039
this is a technology which exists or

3838.96 --> 3842.799
what

3841.039 --> 3845.3590000000004
oh sure you're gonna appeal it is

3842.799 --> 3848.64
possible because we have radio

3845.359 --> 3852.0
transmission of digital information

3848.64 --> 3855.1189999999997
great argument tony okay great argument

3852.0 --> 3858.24
because we have radio communication

3855.119 --> 3859.52
through digitizing of verbal information

3858.24 --> 3862.0
and transfer

3859.52 --> 3864.24
that means that

3862.0 --> 3867.28
a computer

3864.24 --> 3869.52
that can calculate things based on

3867.28 --> 3871.44
having a third state

3869.52 --> 3874.079
that is not a state

3871.44 --> 3878.48
oh yeah now it makes sense

3874.079 --> 3880.799
right because hey if we can digitize

3878.48 --> 3883.2
auditory information transfer it and

3880.799 --> 3886.48
then basically translate it back into

3883.2 --> 3889.52
audio that means that you can deal with

3886.48 --> 3892.4
technology that utilizes a state that is

3889.52 --> 3894.24
in the state okay okay now it makes

3892.4 --> 3897.559
sense

3894.24 --> 3897.5589999999997
no it doesn't

3925.92 --> 3930.319
you are like no

3928.16 --> 3930.319
no

3930.64 --> 3934.0789999999997
that's not what i'm saying at all

3935.119 --> 3939.44
i'm saying what you say makes no logical

3938.0 --> 3943.599
sense

3939.44 --> 3945.28
like even on an information level

3943.599 --> 3949.52
it makes no sense

3945.28 --> 3952.079
it's nonsense it will always be nonsense

3949.52 --> 3953.92
can never not be nonsense because it's

3952.079 --> 3958.3590000000004
not logical it's not a logically

3953.92 --> 3958.359
consistent thing to be saying

3966.319 --> 3972.799
spent millions

3968.96 --> 3975.039
22 oh so you spend millions on a really

3972.799 --> 3977.2
fast computer cool

3975.039 --> 3979.119
that doesn't prove quantum computing at

3977.2 --> 3981.359
all it just proves you have a really

3979.119 --> 3983.119
well developed piece of engineering

3981.359 --> 3985.839
that's very fast

3983.119 --> 3987.76
probably much faster than any sensor you

3985.839 --> 3990.4
could pick up

3987.76 --> 3993.039
to see what's happening yeah and then

3990.4 --> 3995.839
you can make up a shitty story

3993.039 --> 3999.76
about it utilizing a state that is in

3995.839 --> 4001.52
the state and voila quantum computing oh

3999.76 --> 4004.2400000000002
yeah that's it's

4001.52 --> 4006.24
garbage dude it's garbage

4004.24 --> 4009.5989999999997
you're just having a really fast piece

4006.24 --> 4009.5989999999997
of engineering that's all

4009.76 --> 4014.559
you just don't understand

4011.92 --> 4017.28
i just don't understand

4014.559 --> 4019.039
yeah you don't understand either nobody

4017.28 --> 4022.0
understands because it doesn't mean

4019.039 --> 4024.96
anything it's complete horseshit

4022.0 --> 4028.16
you can't utilize a state that is in the

4024.96 --> 4030.559
state that makes no sense you can't use

4028.16 --> 4033.44
something that isn't there

4030.559 --> 4035.599
literally by omission

4033.44 --> 4037.2000000000003
that doesn't make sense

4035.599 --> 4039.6800000000003
you need to stop

4037.2 --> 4040.72
the broken logic you you need to dispel

4039.68 --> 4042.96
this

4040.72 --> 4045.9199999999996
it's about as sensible

4042.96 --> 4047.52
as as hardcore trinitarianism

4045.92 --> 4049.44
to say that you're that you're going to

4047.52 --> 4050.72
pray to your own father but you are your

4049.44 --> 4053.68
father but you

4050.72 --> 4054.64
have to sacrifice you which are your son

4053.68 --> 4057.52
for the

4054.64 --> 4060.4
it's that logic it's broken it doesn't

4057.52 --> 4062.72
make any logical sense and if you accept

4060.4 --> 4064.64
it you're a nut case

4062.72 --> 4067.2
you're a zealot

4064.64 --> 4068.5589999999997
you rest on broken logic because others

4067.2 --> 4070.24
told you

4068.559 --> 4072.799
it's it's solid

4070.24 --> 4076.4799999999996
it makes sense right

4072.799 --> 4079.359
emperor without the clothes

4076.48 --> 4079.359
that's what that is

4089.359 --> 4093.7599999999998
yeah we're right into quantum computing

4091.2 --> 4096.5599999999995
and yeah yeah you just told me you just

4093.76 --> 4098.56
told me tony okay i read into it i read

4096.56 --> 4102.319
exactly what you said

4098.56 --> 4107.359
you said it utilizes a state that isn't

4102.319 --> 4110.159000000001
a state what more do i need to read

4107.359 --> 4111.52
it's complete nonsense and if you don't

4110.159 --> 4113.12
see it

4111.52 --> 4116.2390000000005
then you're

4113.12 --> 4116.239
partially insane

4116.96 --> 4121.839
you fell for the spell of technobabble

4126.48 --> 4131.599999999999
you work at quantum computers oh that's

4129.12 --> 4132.4
so special yeah just like some other

4131.6 --> 4134.799
people

4132.4 --> 4137.2789999999995
have built satellites so that means they

4134.799 --> 4140.839
are real oh yeah

4137.279 --> 4140.839000000001
of course you do

4146.159 --> 4150.08
hmm hey what's that seeking star wars

4156.08 --> 4160.2789999999995
oh jay total media video

4160.88 --> 4165.12
what's this

4162.239 --> 4166.718999999999
oh infrared footage

4165.12 --> 4170.4
yeah i've been seeing some really

4166.719 --> 4170.4
amazing new infrared footage

4170.719 --> 4175.56
unbelievable distances unbelievable

4177.92 --> 4183.52
good stuff

4180.0 --> 4183.52
thanks for the link seeking star wars

4185.92 --> 4191.92
this cons bad karma drop it

4189.279 --> 4193.6
i'm sick of it it's a scam

4191.92 --> 4196.4800000000005
it doesn't make sense you haven't

4193.6 --> 4198.76
addressed how it doesn't make sense

4196.48 --> 4200.839999999999
how it's fundamentally

4198.76 --> 4204.159000000001
philosophically

4200.84 --> 4208.08
illogical like the way the words are

4204.159 --> 4209.839999999999
used in the explanation are illogical

4208.08 --> 4212.159
it's not even on whether there is

4209.84 --> 4213.84
something mechanically possible

4212.159 --> 4216.32
it's

4213.84 --> 4219.12
the information itself the way it is

4216.32 --> 4223.759999999999
presented is illogical

4219.12 --> 4225.76
it's a mind trick it's a spell

4223.76 --> 4227.1990000000005
it's technobabble

4225.76 --> 4230.679
and if you don't see it you have a

4227.199 --> 4230.678999999999
serious problem

4255.36 --> 4260.08
all right and now i'm calling my show

4258.0 --> 4261.6
after it

4260.08 --> 4264.48
since i've been addressing this for

4261.6 --> 4264.4800000000005
quite a while now

4266.8 --> 4269.8
enjoy

4275.92 --> 4278.92
um

4292.56 --> 4302.400000000001
status influx in the quantum world

4298.56 --> 4306.080000000001
so you're so you're actually

4302.4 --> 4310.0
conjuring a medium

4306.08 --> 4312.239
for it you're conjuring a medium

4310.0 --> 4315.13
for this quantum aria

4312.239 --> 4316.718999999999
wow getting all extra dimensional whoo

4315.13 --> 4319.12
[Music]

4316.719 --> 4321.679
man this is so solid dude

4319.12 --> 4325.44
i mean that sounds like interdimensional

4321.679 --> 4327.4400000000005
and [ __ ] that's like that must be real

4325.44 --> 4330.639999999999
that that can't just be a bunch of

4327.44 --> 4333.12
calculations squirting nonsense sci-fi

4330.64 --> 4335.4400000000005
technobabble [ __ ] could it

4333.12 --> 4335.44
hmm

4335.84 --> 4340.360000000001
right anyway i'll be back two minutes

4420.64 --> 4423.64
uh

4440.159 --> 4445.199
that a seismograph can ignore background

4442.88 --> 4448.1990000000005
noise well

4445.199 --> 4448.199
okay

4466.0 --> 4469.0
what

4471.04 --> 4474.679
there you go an inspector

4493.199 --> 4497.639999999999
right yeah kind of like

4506.159 --> 4513.04
i think i made my point now

4510.159 --> 4516.0
about quantum computing now it's

4513.04 --> 4516.0
complete nonsense

4516.719 --> 4521.6
it deals with a state that is in the

4519.199 --> 4521.599999999999
state

4523.28 --> 4528.5599999999995
i'm not going to get over that for a

4524.88 --> 4528.56
while it's hilarious

4530.4 --> 4535.599999999999
i mean that that could just

4532.56 --> 4538.6
fit straight in star trek

4535.6 --> 4538.6
amazing

4550.56 --> 4554.96
it probably lent from that they probably

4552.88 --> 4556.88
kind of made that [ __ ] up and then this

4554.96 --> 4559.04
uh they thought like oh let's do this in

4556.88 --> 4561.04
the real world or at least say you're

4559.04 --> 4562.719
doing that

4561.04 --> 4566.239
to give a nice

4562.719 --> 4570.08
sci-fi futurist cover story for just

4566.239 --> 4572.48
really really fast computers that work

4570.08 --> 4573.92
fast because they've been engineered to

4572.48 --> 4576.159
work

4573.92 --> 4578.719
beyond what we would think

4576.159 --> 4580.799999999999
was possible based on the old

4578.719 --> 4583.84
engineering approach right

4580.8 --> 4585.360000000001
it's absolutely [ __ ] to do with quantum

4583.84 --> 4588.0
states

4585.36 --> 4589.04
absolute [ __ ] has nothing to do with

4588.0 --> 4592.56
that

4589.04 --> 4592.56
makes no sense whatsoever

4593.36 --> 4597.839999999999
at best it's it's more like just

4596.0 --> 4599.12
electric patterns

4597.84 --> 4601.360000000001
right

4599.12 --> 4604.239
why these chips are getting so fast is

4601.36 --> 4606.839999999999
because they've just mastered electric

4604.239 --> 4610.239
fractal patterns like the nature of

4606.84 --> 4612.56
electrics how it manifests and thereby

4610.239 --> 4615.36
they basically design these chips for

4612.56 --> 4617.52
optimal electric

4615.36 --> 4619.92
manifestation

4617.52 --> 4621.360000000001
they design it by the patterns of

4619.92 --> 4623.76
electrics

4621.36 --> 4626.799999999999
and so there is like no more friction

4623.76 --> 4629.52
then because it fits the patterns

4626.8 --> 4632.159000000001
perfectly like

4629.52 --> 4633.6
that's how i would explain the ever

4632.159 --> 4635.04
increasing

4633.6 --> 4638.2390000000005
speed

4635.04 --> 4640.0
of microchip technology

4638.239 --> 4641.599999999999
it's because of like maximized

4640.0 --> 4644.88
efficiency

4641.6 --> 4647.92
that just goes beyond our imagination in

4644.88 --> 4651.12
ways it has absolutely nothing to do

4647.92 --> 4653.92
with quantum states that's ridiculous

4651.12 --> 4653.92
ridiculous

4656.719 --> 4660.719
yeah oh sure you can remind me of that

4658.88 --> 4663.719
yeah it's still going to be exactly the

4660.719 --> 4663.719
same

4668.8 --> 4674.88
yeah this those are all straw men toady

4670.88 --> 4674.88
uk i've never said any of that

4675.6 --> 4680.08
but but you can definitely remind me how

4678.08 --> 4683.92
i said that

4680.08 --> 4686.64
computers that utilize a state that is

4683.92 --> 4689.12
in the state is ridiculous yeah you can

4686.64 --> 4691.12
absolutely remind me about that

4689.12 --> 4692.719
and then when you do i'll remind you

4691.12 --> 4694.64
about it

4692.719 --> 4697.92
because it is ridiculous it's

4694.64 --> 4697.92
technobabble nonsense

4705.44 --> 4709.36
but yeah you don't need to remind me

4707.12 --> 4710.64
about these ridiculous straw man because

4709.36 --> 4714.159
i would never

4710.64 --> 4714.159000000001
care to even claim any of that

4715.6 --> 4720.76
nobody said the quantum world was

4717.76 --> 4720.76
comprehensible

4725.84 --> 4729.76
oh my god

4727.52 --> 4729.76
oh

4729.92 --> 4732.96
that's hilarious

4733.76 --> 4736.159000000001
yeah

4734.8 --> 4738.88
this

4736.159 --> 4742.799999999999
i i bet the same goes for einstein right

4738.88 --> 4745.12
pseudonymonian force base nobody

4742.8 --> 4747.92
we wouldn't expect to

4745.12 --> 4749.76
truly understand what pseudo-ammonia in

4747.92 --> 4752.4800000000005
forespace is

4749.76 --> 4755.12
because it's like this other depth

4752.48 --> 4756.4
incorporating time within the speciality

4755.12 --> 4757.84
yeah you

4756.4 --> 4760.639999999999
it's very

4757.84 --> 4763.52
unlike what you experience so

4760.64 --> 4767.04
we shouldn't expect to understand it

4763.52 --> 4768.96
fully what we can calculate with it

4767.04 --> 4773.56
yes

4768.96 --> 4773.56
surely you trust this

4785.28 --> 4791.159
but yeah thanks for the laughs today

4786.88 --> 4791.159000000001
okay i appreciate that

4811.679 --> 4817.719
why so much money invested in space

4814.239 --> 4817.718999999999
because it's

4818.48 --> 4823.199
sci-fi

4819.76 --> 4823.1990000000005
it's just a market for

4823.679 --> 4828.8
story [ __ ]

4825.199 --> 4828.799999999999
people want to hear more stories

4828.96 --> 4833.92
they want to believe it's real and

4830.48 --> 4835.759999999999
they'll pay money to religiously double

4833.92 --> 4838.2390000000005
down on those beliefs to have them

4835.76 --> 4840.320000000001
reinforced through the rituals that are

4838.239 --> 4842.638999999999
very expensive

4840.32 --> 4845.36
but at the same time those that do not

4842.639 --> 4848.8
understand it for what it is will be

4845.36 --> 4850.639
like wow this guy is actually investing

4848.8 --> 4855.360000000001
in the future

4850.639 --> 4855.36
oh so special so you'll get credit

4855.76 --> 4859.84
from

4857.28 --> 4861.84
the goji from the numpties

4859.84 --> 4863.12
from the people that actually buy it the

4861.84 --> 4865.76
cattle

4863.12 --> 4868.0
right so yeah that kind of makes it sort

4865.76 --> 4870.0
of worthwhile

4868.0 --> 4871.76
for the people that do that

4870.0 --> 4873.28
like oh i'm an investor in the space

4871.76 --> 4874.96
project and there will be a whole bunch

4873.28 --> 4876.48
of people that'll actually believe

4874.96 --> 4878.4
that's real and they'll be like wow

4876.48 --> 4880.879999999999
that's cool man

4878.4 --> 4882.638999999999
oh let's go to the future

4880.88 --> 4885.28
right

4882.639 --> 4885.28
that's why

4886.159 --> 4888.48
more

4887.44 --> 4890.5599999999995
space

4888.48 --> 4893.5599999999995
entertainment media pretending to be

4890.56 --> 4893.56
real

4908.88 --> 4911.1990000000005
right

4915.52 --> 4920.88
oh tony okay oh so

4917.92 --> 4922.159
so you really like this quantum realm

4920.88 --> 4923.04
right

4922.159 --> 4926.719
because

4923.04 --> 4928.32
if you believe the quantum realm

4926.719 --> 4929.28
is correct

4928.32 --> 4932.239
then

4929.28 --> 4933.5199999999995
nobody is certain anymore

4932.239 --> 4936.4
because

4933.52 --> 4938.8
what about the quantum states with the

4936.4 --> 4940.879999999999
quantum states then certainly

4938.8 --> 4943.12
you don't really know

4940.88 --> 4945.92
so there is no more certainty yeah i've

4943.12 --> 4948.239
heard that story before tony uk i know

4945.92 --> 4948.2390000000005
yeah

4949.12 --> 4954.719
it's it's a nice little angle into

4952.4 --> 4957.12
solipsism isn't it

4954.719 --> 4959.28
i mean it's like you don't know what is

4957.12 --> 4961.84
real because it could be

4959.28 --> 4964.32
in a quantum flux outside of your

4961.84 --> 4965.84
perception and then what you take for

4964.32 --> 4967.5199999999995
granted to be true even though

4965.84 --> 4970.56
everything is in place

4967.52 --> 4973.84
well it actually doesn't make sense now

4970.56 --> 4976.14
because of the quantum realm

4973.84 --> 4981.02
that you cannot perceive

4976.14 --> 4981.02
[Music]

4986.48 --> 4989.48
uh

5006.48 --> 5011.5199999999995
a recent study found intention could

5008.8 --> 5014.52
influence quantum state

5011.52 --> 5014.52
no

5016.159 --> 5020.96
it can influence the outcome

5018.96 --> 5022.32
of things has nothing to do with quantum

5020.96 --> 5025.679
state

5022.32 --> 5027.759999999999
the quantum state is a conceptual

5025.679 --> 5030.4800000000005
idea

5027.76 --> 5031.84
that's put on top of practical reality

5030.48 --> 5033.12
situations

5031.84 --> 5036.2390000000005
that's right

5033.12 --> 5039.12
if you focus with your intention

5036.239 --> 5043.04
like while throwing a dice it will

5039.12 --> 5045.84
influence the dice in a certain way

5043.04 --> 5046.96
you can actually learn how to

5045.84 --> 5049.1990000000005
predict

5046.96 --> 5051.36
how certain types of intentions will

5049.199 --> 5054.159
influence what under what circumstances

5051.36 --> 5056.4
which is a very complex thing

5054.159 --> 5059.92
on an intuitive level

5056.4 --> 5062.159
but yes intention absolutely influence

5059.92 --> 5065.04
the mechanical outcomes of things that's

5062.159 --> 5067.04
right has absolute [ __ ] to do with

5065.04 --> 5068.48
quantum state

5067.04 --> 5070.719
yeah

5068.48 --> 5074.4
has nothing to do with that it's just

5070.719 --> 5076.56
practical yeah your intention

5074.4 --> 5079.12
your sensation

5076.56 --> 5081.04
your internal wiring

5079.12 --> 5084.159
can influence

5081.04 --> 5086.48
the outcome of mechanical things that's

5084.159 --> 5086.48
right

5088.56 --> 5092.6
has nothing to do with quantum

5112.32 --> 5116.639
yeah if you look at quantum and

5114.56 --> 5120.400000000001
understand it would change so you cannot

5116.639 --> 5122.639
yeah that's why it's complete fiction

5120.4 --> 5123.92
it's it's like pseudo-romanian four

5122.639 --> 5126.400000000001
space

5123.92 --> 5128.08
you can't prove it

5126.4 --> 5130.96
you can't prove it

5128.08 --> 5133.6
you can claim it

5130.96 --> 5136.2390000000005
you can't prove it because you can't

5133.6 --> 5136.2390000000005
detect it

5137.52 --> 5143.679
and yeah usually in those types of cases

5140.4 --> 5143.679
it means it doesn't exist

5146.719 --> 5150.639
right if you can't even interact with

5148.639 --> 5152.719
something to prove it exists

5150.639 --> 5155.719
well it's safe to say it's not very

5152.719 --> 5155.719
scientific

5174.96 --> 5181.6
by changing see this is all technobabble

5178.239 --> 5184.159
you're just lit dude erase the word

5181.6 --> 5185.92
quantum state

5184.159 --> 5188.32
and then look through all of it again

5185.92 --> 5190.88
and you'll figure out yeah intention

5188.32 --> 5191.92
influences the mechanical outcome of

5190.88 --> 5196.88
things

5191.92 --> 5201.36
has nothing to do with quantum state

5196.88 --> 5204.08
that's a conjured concept on top of it

5201.36 --> 5208.08
leave it out and it works perfectly

5204.08 --> 5208.08
which means it's superfluous

5208.639 --> 5215.36
do you understand

5210.88 --> 5215.36
it has nothing to do with anything

5216.159 --> 5219.839999999999
intention

5218.32 --> 5223.28
influencing

5219.84 --> 5225.84
mechanical outcome has nothing to do

5223.28 --> 5227.759999999999
with quantum state

5225.84 --> 5230.96
that's [ __ ]

5227.76 --> 5233.04
that's a techno babble invention that is

5230.96 --> 5235.84
completely superfluous

5233.04 --> 5239.84
and when you leave it out

5235.84 --> 5239.84
it it all just works fine

5239.92 --> 5244.679
you don't need to insert it because it's

5242.56 --> 5248.4800000000005
nonsense and it's literally

5244.679 --> 5252.6
unprovable by admission

5248.48 --> 5252.599999999999
for [ __ ] sake people

5268.56 --> 5272.080000000001
oh okay pg crew shank

5273.44 --> 5278.159
all right well dude take care

5275.92 --> 5278.159
look

5279.36 --> 5285.04
take care of yourself first i mean i'm

5281.199 --> 5287.28
doing all right at the moment

5285.04 --> 5289.44
if if you need more like

5287.28 --> 5291.759999999999
extra time

5289.44 --> 5295.839999999999
or you need it right now then

5291.76 --> 5295.84
just wait a month or something you know

5297.679 --> 5301.88
i'm doing okay right now

5310.88 --> 5317.4400000000005
and realize reality of possible outcomes

5314.48 --> 5320.879999999999
yeah but that's a concept

5317.44 --> 5323.759999999999
it's conceptual

5320.88 --> 5326.0
it's the study of like chance and all

5323.76 --> 5326.88
that

5326.0 --> 5329.28
how

5326.88 --> 5331.679
statistically

5329.28 --> 5333.44
random things like there is statistics

5331.679 --> 5336.2390000000005
to random right

5333.44 --> 5338.5599999999995
random is random unless you have it a

5336.239 --> 5340.638999999999
thousand times or a million times and

5338.56 --> 5342.639
then random subtly isn't that random

5340.639 --> 5344.159000000001
anymore it becomes statistically

5342.639 --> 5346.4800000000005
averaged

5344.159 --> 5349.759999999999
and that statistical average can be

5346.48 --> 5350.879999999999
influenced through intention

5349.76 --> 5354.08
that's it

5350.88 --> 5356.56
that's like the entire knowledge

5354.08 --> 5359.04
of where quantum sci-fi [ __ ]

5356.56 --> 5362.0
technobubble is resting on on that

5359.04 --> 5362.84
that's it that is all it is

5362.0 --> 5367.36
you

5362.84 --> 5367.360000000001
understand there is nothing else

5367.92 --> 5374.08
there is no quantum realm there is no

5370.96 --> 5377.12
state that is in the state it's all

5374.08 --> 5378.32
mathematical conceptual

5377.12 --> 5382.5599999999995
admit it

5378.32 --> 5382.5599999999995
not to be provable it's [ __ ]

5388.88 --> 5393.0
all right pj crush and cool

5407.84 --> 5411.4400000000005
right

5409.679 --> 5413.36
i think i'm gonna round out the show

5411.44 --> 5416.159
maybe a bit early so i can go out for

5413.36 --> 5418.32
groceries quickly and not miss

5416.159 --> 5421.599999999999
the majority of the

5418.32 --> 5423.04
live fed

5421.6 --> 5424.56
right and i'm i'm done with these guys

5423.04 --> 5427.76
they're gonna blabber on forever

5424.56 --> 5430.2390000000005
apparently toady is all invested into it

5427.76 --> 5431.6
so he literally bought into quantum

5430.239 --> 5434.879999999999
computing

5431.6 --> 5438.400000000001
technobabble nonsense professionally

5434.88 --> 5440.56
so yeah he's gonna just chant on

5438.4 --> 5442.96
trying to defend

5440.56 --> 5444.8
what he invested in so much and he's

5442.96 --> 5447.12
probably not gonna stop because he's

5444.8 --> 5449.4400000000005
like literally physically invested in

5447.12 --> 5451.44
the [ __ ]

5449.44 --> 5453.919999999999
in concerning this

5451.44 --> 5456.0
not just space thing so yeah there's no

5453.92 --> 5459.1990000000005
use he's just gonna chant and chant to

5456.0 --> 5460.84
chant the same [ __ ] over and over again

5459.199 --> 5463.759999999999
yeah tony

5460.84 --> 5467.4400000000005
chant that's what you're doing

5463.76 --> 5467.4400000000005
you're not addressing anything

5470.48 --> 5475.08
right so i'm gonna round out the show

5481.52 --> 5486.159000000001
quantum mechanics yeah but we're not

5483.76 --> 5487.04
even talking about quantum mechanics

5486.159 --> 5488.96
right

5487.04 --> 5493.12
in this case we were talking about

5488.96 --> 5493.12
quantum computing and quantum state

5494.4 --> 5497.92
that's

5495.679 --> 5497.92
like

5498.08 --> 5502.48
inspired on quantum mechanics

5502.88 --> 5508.08
it's not quantum mechanics it's

5505.04 --> 5510.32
technobubble [ __ ]

5508.08 --> 5510.32
it's

5510.96 --> 5515.12
deals with the state that is in the

5513.44 --> 5518.638999999999
state

5515.12 --> 5520.8
and is admitted not to be perceivable

5518.639 --> 5524.2390000000005
not to actually be measurable it's

5520.8 --> 5524.2390000000005
technobabble [ __ ]

5524.48 --> 5530.4
i mean even actual quantum mechanics the

5527.84 --> 5532.400000000001
the experimentation with that

5530.4 --> 5534.638999999999
if it is all real and i'm going to

5532.4 --> 5538.0
assume in this instance it is

5534.639 --> 5540.159000000001
is literally physically provable that's

5538.0 --> 5542.159
why that exists

5540.159 --> 5543.599999999999
knowing which path experimentation for

5542.159 --> 5547.44
example right

5543.6 --> 5550.159000000001
that's a physical measurable result

5547.44 --> 5550.159
that's proof

5550.239 --> 5556.638999999999
to then move on and say look i'm gonna

5553.92 --> 5559.04
use this thing that uses a state that is

5556.639 --> 5562.0
in the state and you can't measure it

5559.04 --> 5565.04
because then it just disappears

5562.0 --> 5567.36
it's kind of a step too far

5565.04 --> 5570.08
right there's no more tangible physical

5567.36 --> 5573.199
way to prove it it just becomes a

5570.08 --> 5574.8
conceptual nonsense story

5573.199 --> 5577.759999999999
and you can literally

5574.8 --> 5579.76
cut it out of these things

5577.76 --> 5581.6
which supposedly utilize it and then

5579.76 --> 5583.679
you'll see that everything is just

5581.6 --> 5585.92
perfectly fine without it it's

5583.679 --> 5588.88
superfluous it's nonsense it's

5585.92 --> 5589.84
unprovable nonsense

5588.88 --> 5592.400000000001
right

5589.84 --> 5594.32
but i am rounding out now so thanks

5592.4 --> 5595.599999999999
everyone for coming i hope you liked

5594.32 --> 5599.04
this show

5595.6 --> 5601.120000000001
if you didn't then you probably invested

5599.04 --> 5603.84
a whole chunk of your life in this

5601.12 --> 5606.159
nonsense technobabble [ __ ] called

5603.84 --> 5608.4400000000005
quantum computing and you really think

5606.159 --> 5612.239
it's super special and you

5608.44 --> 5615.28
understanding it makes you super special

5612.239 --> 5617.44
yeah well i'm sorry you're wrong

5615.28 --> 5619.92
but if you did like this show then

5617.44 --> 5622.0
please don't forget to rogan's it up and

5619.92 --> 5624.0
if you haven't already subscribe to my

5622.0 --> 5626.0
channel and hit the bell notification so

5624.0 --> 5627.84
you know when i'm going live which is

5626.0 --> 5629.84
normally 1 p.m amsterdam time in the

5627.84 --> 5632.719
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

5629.84 --> 5634.88
weekend and please also do support me

5632.719 --> 5636.719
through the paypal patreon crypto wallet

5634.88 --> 5639.84
super chat and membership system join

5636.719 --> 5642.56
button that will be much appreciated

5639.84 --> 5646.2390000000005
i can still use it but there's no direct

5642.56 --> 5646.2390000000005
urgency at this very moment

5646.48 --> 5653.44
because yeah my fundraiser

5649.6 --> 5655.280000000001
from last friday was a big success

5653.44 --> 5656.159
very happy for everybody that came

5655.28 --> 5657.44
through

5656.159 --> 5660.239
and yeah

5657.44 --> 5662.799999999999
rent is paid and uh yeah i'm definitely

5660.239 --> 5664.638999999999
going to be able to feed myself the

5662.8 --> 5665.52
the coming week and more

5664.639 --> 5668.08
so

5665.52 --> 5669.76
but yeah that doesn't mean it's like

5668.08 --> 5672.719
like now i never

5669.76 --> 5675.4400000000005
i can like carry on

5672.719 --> 5677.28
forever because i will still need just

5675.44 --> 5680.159
regular funding

5677.28 --> 5682.5599999999995
to keep going unfortunately that's the

5680.159 --> 5684.638999999999
way it is i hope you guys can accept it

5682.56 --> 5687.119000000001
and find me a worthy enough investment

5684.639 --> 5688.8
