sorry for being a little late

74.24 --> 82.15899999999999
just got distracted uh

78.08 --> 85.2
whether today is or well it used to be

82.159 --> 87.04
it was very sunny but now there's like

85.2 --> 90.88
this

87.04 --> 95.2
light cloud grown over

90.88 --> 95.19999999999999
it was really blue and nice and sunny

98.4 --> 102.0
but yeah it's still it's still kind of

100.64 --> 105.84
nice weather

102.0 --> 110.479
it's cold but not so

105.84 --> 110.479
moist as it was yesterday i think

112.0 --> 116.0
and there doesn't seem to be a lot of

113.439 --> 121.19999999999999
wind either

116.0 --> 121.2
right so

123.52 --> 131.76
i got green tea with me

128.0 --> 135.28
let's see who's in chat all right

131.76 --> 138.239
well here we go again was first

135.28 --> 138.879
noticed your message in skype [ __ ]

138.239 --> 143.84
wazzle

138.879 --> 143.84
terror 306 robin stanley

143.92 --> 146.79999999999998
good to see you all

150.64 --> 154.0
cloud shelf right

154.56 --> 159.28
it's it's just a it's a thin layer

157.04 --> 159.28
though

161.36 --> 165.92000000000002
there's still plenty of sun coming

163.519 --> 165.92000000000002
through it

166.56 --> 171.84
as you can see by the shadows behind me

173.68 --> 185.84
right so yeah how are you all doing

186.4 --> 191.36
sunday is it it's sunday right yeah

191.44 --> 200.48
yeah it feels like a sunday

194.8 --> 203.59900000000002
it's calm and i went to bed

200.48 --> 205.599
kind of early for my doing and i got up

203.599 --> 208.79899999999998
a little bit earlier but despite that

205.599 --> 211.04
yeah i'm still late like

208.799 --> 212.0
it's not even sometimes about like how

211.04 --> 214.959
how what time

212.0 --> 214.959
i get up it's just

219.04 --> 224.84
when i basically prepare in my mind to

221.44 --> 228.879
start doing something i start

224.84 --> 231.92000000000002
compressing i don't know

228.879 --> 234.0
seems like last half year that process

231.92 --> 236.879
kind of

234.0 --> 237.28
it mismatches a little so because of

236.879 --> 241.04
that

237.28 --> 244.4
it just takes more time to compress

241.04 --> 247.92
and i bet yeah i before i

244.4 --> 249.519
was yeah i don't know it

247.92 --> 251.83999999999997
has to do with the amount of energy you

249.519 --> 253.12
got i think because when you got

251.84 --> 255.12
plenty of energy you don't get

253.12 --> 257.519
distracted then the compression works

255.12 --> 259.12
perfectly within the timing and

257.519 --> 261.04
when you're slowing down a little then

259.12 --> 269.84000000000003
it i don't know with me sometimes it

261.04 --> 269.84000000000003
doesn't work perfectly

270.8 --> 278.24
anyway yeah

274.24 --> 278.24
yesterday it's kind of a

279.199 --> 284.40000000000003
what there happened no

282.479 --> 286.24
life ball busters or anything didn't

284.4 --> 289.35999999999996
really watch any shows

286.24 --> 293.28000000000003
a couple of videos here and there

289.36 --> 296.0
huh oh yeah during grocery shopping

293.28 --> 299.19899999999996
there was an interesting site

296.0 --> 300.72
because yesterday

299.199 --> 302.479
after the show there was just some

300.72 --> 307.03900000000004
really odd

302.479 --> 307.039
cloud formations and

307.36 --> 310.56
odd confirmations there was just this

309.52 --> 313.28
big

310.56 --> 313.28000000000003
amount of

313.84 --> 317.19899999999996
cloud that was raining hanging in the

316.16 --> 320.24
air and

317.199 --> 322.08000000000004
like right in front of the sun or

320.24 --> 323.52
in opposite of the sun i don't remember

322.08 --> 324.96
what it was like

323.52 --> 327.039
but it just remembered that there was

324.96 --> 330.23999999999995
this huge

327.039 --> 331.52
thick colored rainbow like almost a

330.24 --> 334.72
double rainbow but

331.52 --> 337.35999999999996
really big and you could see it from one

334.72 --> 338.24
side apparent side to the other all the

337.36 --> 340.32
way

338.24 --> 343.039
and like a lot of people were even

340.32 --> 343.52
outside looking at it and photographing

343.039 --> 345.68
it

343.52 --> 347.52
like all over the place during my entire

345.68 --> 350.88
journey to there

347.52 --> 352.71999999999997
this huge huge rainbow visible here in

350.88 --> 357.039
utrecht i don't know

352.72 --> 357.03900000000004
how far people could see that

363.52 --> 367.68
right and then it was just fooling

366.08 --> 370.56
around in my mind a little with the

367.68 --> 370.56
mechanics of that

371.52 --> 376.56
thinking like okay so rain doesn't bring

374.56 --> 381.28000000000003
a rainbow

376.56 --> 385.28000000000003
normally the sun doesn't bring a rainbow

381.28 --> 388.31899999999996
but when it rains and there is sun then

385.28 --> 388.31899999999996
there is a rainbow

391.52 --> 395.84
i don't know doesn't really mean

393.12 --> 395.84000000000003
anything

397.28 --> 401.44
but yeah it it did bring an interesting

400.4 --> 404.479
atmosphere

401.44 --> 406.4
like uh feeling wise in the air and just

404.479 --> 408.639
it was funny kind of seeing all these

406.4 --> 409.35999999999996
people outside like like they've all

408.639 --> 411.12
seen

409.36 --> 413.599
like it was the first time they saw an

411.12 --> 415.84000000000003
actual real rainbow or something

413.599 --> 417.12
but it was it just really stood out it

415.84 --> 420.79999999999995
was big

417.12 --> 420.8
very v it like took up

421.039 --> 426.31899999999996
a third of the sky you could just see it

423.919 --> 428.24
very widely

426.319 --> 430.24
you would really have to look exactly

428.24 --> 432.0
the other way not seeing it

430.24 --> 433.759
so it just stood out a lot of people

432.0 --> 436.4
were just looking at it

433.759 --> 439.039
and also might be because people usually

436.4 --> 442.08
don't pay that much attention visually

439.039 --> 442.88
and because this one stood so out stood

442.08 --> 446.08
out so much

442.88 --> 446.8
people did really pay attention i don't

446.08 --> 449.52
know

446.8 --> 452.24
but it it was kind of special almost

449.52 --> 455.12
yeah i'm sorry

452.24 --> 456.08
i didn't like pick up the camera and

455.12 --> 457.759
filmed it

456.08 --> 460.4
because it was pretty special but then i

457.759 --> 464.16
thought okay everybody's doing that

460.4 --> 466.23999999999995
out there

464.16 --> 468.319
so there's probably a lot of rainbow

466.24 --> 471.759
pictures now from

468.319 --> 474.16
from yeah from utrecht here

471.759 --> 475.52000000000004
if you look on the internet and i'm not

474.16 --> 477.84000000000003
doing that

475.52 --> 480.24
oh but yeah i could probably just google

477.84 --> 483.599
rainbow utrecht and then

480.24 --> 488.08
see a lot of it but whatever

483.599 --> 488.08
was it double yeah it was kind of double

490.96 --> 495.599
but the outer shell was it was still

494.16 --> 498.72
visible it was just not

495.599 --> 502.96
as blatant as the inner

498.72 --> 502.96000000000004
the inner rainbow which is like so

504.84 --> 511.19899999999996
bright

507.28 --> 511.84
hmm all right but i've seen rainbows

511.199 --> 515.279
before

511.84 --> 517.76
get to see them a lot when they're there

515.279 --> 518.719
because of this location it's very yeah

517.76 --> 521.99
you can

518.719 --> 523.599
look all over the place i got

521.99 --> 527.08
[Music]

523.599 --> 530.6400000000001
how much is it like

527.08 --> 535.839
240 degrees view pretty much

530.64 --> 535.8389999999999
a little more even

536.78 --> 542.0
[Music]

538.8 --> 544.399
all right so yeah that that's it about

542.0 --> 547.68
the notes

544.399 --> 548.16
uh wait i think you can also watch the

547.68 --> 552.56
movie

548.16 --> 552.56
yesterday was it again

560.72 --> 564.64
all right i remember

568.64 --> 573.279
yeah i watched a movie that i hadn't

570.08 --> 575.519
seen before although i heard of it

573.279 --> 577.2
and wasn't too much interested at the

575.519 --> 580.399
time it's like the incredible hulk

577.2 --> 583.44
from 2006 or eight

580.399 --> 586.56
something and

583.44 --> 589.9200000000001
yeah it was interesting

586.56 --> 592.7199999999999
but my god the cgi was just really

589.92 --> 592.7199999999999
atrocious

595.2 --> 599.839
but still doable i don't know

600.8 --> 607.519
it wasn't super special doctor strange

604.48 --> 607.519
i've already seen that

612.399 --> 615.76
right but i don't want to really get

613.92 --> 618.079
into the details of the movie it was

615.76 --> 621.76
very hollywood

618.079 --> 624.56
and awkward in a way

621.76 --> 625.519
it had very similar elements feeling

624.56 --> 627.68
wise to

625.519 --> 629.04
um don't know if it's the same director

627.68 --> 632.959
or anything

629.04 --> 635.519
as the spider-man movies

632.959 --> 636.56
it just was very sensitive very feely

635.519 --> 639.76
but like

636.56 --> 641.4399999999999
kind of out of place like that had a lot

639.76 --> 643.519
of that

641.44 --> 645.6
and big thing that stood out is that the

643.519 --> 650.32
whole movie was really fixated on

645.6 --> 650.32
show not tell and i did appreciate that

650.48 --> 654.16
because there was just a lot of things

652.56 --> 656.4799999999999
happening without

654.16 --> 658.399
talking through it and that part about

656.48 --> 660.48
it was kind of nice

658.399 --> 662.16
so that's like the good thing about it

660.48 --> 663.12
that i thought just like a lot of show

662.16 --> 665.1999999999999
don't tell and

663.12 --> 666.88
yeah that's cool and there were

665.2 --> 669.76
interesting visuals

666.88 --> 670.16
yeah except just the the hulk cgi was

669.76 --> 673.519
just

670.16 --> 675.279
really freaking ugly and see yeah cgi

673.519 --> 678.9590000000001
apparent

675.279 --> 679.92
i think that later on in the newer hoke

678.959 --> 683.1199999999999
movies

679.92 --> 689.8389999999999
they significantly improved on that

683.12 --> 689.839
so that it just doesn't it's not as ugly

697.839 --> 702.24
but yeah i thought it was just really

700.839 --> 706.9590000000001
ugly

702.24 --> 710.16
anyway here's one on reddit what

706.959 --> 710.16
rainbow utrec

714.839 --> 719.889
huh

716.75 --> 719.889
[Music]

722.24 --> 725.839
hey look the sun's coming out

728.839 --> 731.839
yay

739.92 --> 745.92
reading king's destroyed have you no i

743.2 --> 745.9200000000001
haven't read it

749.04 --> 756.16
like i don't read books okay

753.12 --> 759.12
i've been sharing that since since i

756.16 --> 760.959
pretty much came on onto youtube it's

759.12 --> 763.44
like i'm not really a book reader

760.959 --> 763.4399999999999
overall

764.399 --> 771.279
like i might read a book somewhere

768.88 --> 773.76
but then it's really because i have

771.279 --> 776.48
something that i want from that book

773.76 --> 777.6
because i rarely i just read books like

776.48 --> 780.32
my parents

777.6 --> 780.88
especially my mother and my brother that

780.32 --> 785.279
they were

780.88 --> 785.279
book readers brother might still be

785.519 --> 790.5600000000001
i never really was like the biggest

788.959 --> 793.1199999999999
thing i've ever read

790.56 --> 793.92
purely on a voluntary basis was the lord

793.12 --> 796.9590000000001
of the rings

793.92 --> 801.12
pretty big sized yeah

796.959 --> 802.88
big block of books three books

801.12 --> 804.88
and yeah that wasn't quite a hassle

802.88 --> 806.0
quite an effort but yeah again i had

804.88 --> 808.48
something to get

806.0 --> 808.48
from that

809.76 --> 815.279
something that was one that i wanted to

812.839 --> 818.32
attain

815.279 --> 818.32
really get into it

818.639 --> 823.36
and that's also man that's like 20 years

820.88 --> 823.36
ago now

824.16 --> 830.959
so i don't read a lot of books

828.24 --> 833.92
i've read quite a few news articles

830.959 --> 836.959
especially around 10 years ago

833.92 --> 838.24
but yeah those aren't like yeah 100

836.959 --> 841.1199999999999
pages or

838.24 --> 842.32
multiple hundred pages you know because

841.12 --> 844.0
i

842.32 --> 845.87
i've always had the problem that i just

844.0 --> 848.48
get distracted

845.87 --> 850.8
[Music]

848.48 --> 852.9590000000001
like either i get distracted because

850.8 --> 854.88
it's badly written and annoying or

852.959 --> 858.7199999999999
repetitive or something just

854.88 --> 861.279
annoying or it's really good and then

858.72 --> 861.279
sometimes

861.44 --> 864.9590000000001
i like go into this fractal like

864.399 --> 867.36
thinking

864.959 --> 868.2399999999999
about it while i'm reading it and then i

867.36 --> 871.6800000000001
end up

868.24 --> 874.32
basically dreaming my own version

871.68 --> 876.7199999999999
continuation of what's happening and not

874.32 --> 879.12
really reading it anymore

876.72 --> 880.24
that's used to be my problem it's

879.12 --> 883.199
probably not as bad

880.24 --> 884.16
now as it would have been like 30 years

883.199 --> 886.079
ago

884.16 --> 887.36
but that's still like a mechanism that

886.079 --> 889.279
typically happens

887.36 --> 892.0
and i used to associate that with ooh

889.279 --> 892.0
it's like a

892.24 --> 899.12
add type effect or something

896.8 --> 899.92
i just get distracted so i've never been

899.12 --> 904.639
much of a

899.92 --> 904.639
pro not a very effective book reader

910.839 --> 915.1990000000001
anyway

913.36 --> 916.88
yeah and by the way the same goes for

915.199 --> 920.8
the bible literally

916.88 --> 922.56
the same goes for the bible the two

920.8 --> 923.92
different type of scenarios that are

922.56 --> 925.76
laid out both

923.92 --> 930.0
happen even as they read the bible

925.76 --> 930.0
that's why at some point i just stop and

938.839 --> 942.399
yep that's like a dream state

941.199 --> 945.4399999999999
self-hypnosis

942.399 --> 947.53
yeah and

945.44 --> 949.44
with me it comes originally from

947.53 --> 951.68
[Music]

949.44 --> 954.24
like i started out learning to do that

951.68 --> 956.4499999999999
it's like i'm a dreamer that's

954.24 --> 957.92
when i was a really little kid

956.45 --> 960.0790000000001
[Music]

957.92 --> 962.24
all my senses and everything awoke

960.079 --> 964.7199999999999
really early

962.24 --> 966.0790000000001
like sort of a rapid maturity thing

964.72 --> 968.48
spiritually

966.079 --> 970.0
but because i wasn't really able to deal

968.48 --> 972.48
with the world

970.0 --> 975.12
as a defense mechanism as a way to get

972.48 --> 978.48
around and still feel okay

975.12 --> 981.44
i learned to dream really quickly

978.48 --> 982.399
because in my dream i had the room for

981.44 --> 984.399
everything to do

982.399 --> 986.32
things with my mind and think about it

984.399 --> 989.44
and all kinds of things

986.32 --> 997.839
so that's why i learned to do that way

989.44 --> 1002.5600000000001
before i even learned to communicate

997.839 --> 1004.32
but yeah it's also quite an obstacle

1002.56 --> 1006.8
especially when i don't feel very

1004.32 --> 1008.72
comfortable with myself

1006.8 --> 1011.8389999999999
then the dreaming starts up it's

1008.72 --> 1011.839
annoying gets in the way

1012.72 --> 1025.839
hey mind warped hello welcome back

1015.839 --> 1027.679
no caps please

1025.839 --> 1029.52
all right you still had a wrench i

1027.679 --> 1039.8390000000002
didn't take it away

1029.52 --> 1039.839
didn't even remember

1042.959 --> 1048.079
can you keep it yeah sure well if you

1045.12 --> 1050.0
just behave

1048.079 --> 1051.52
i think last time you were getting like

1050.0 --> 1054.08
worked up around something

1051.52 --> 1057.44
and then you said let go take my wrench

1054.08 --> 1059.4399999999998
and i just didn't do it and you left

1057.44 --> 1062.4
because i only really take wrenches when

1059.44 --> 1065.44
you start to abuse the wrenches

1062.4 --> 1068.64
if you're just going nuts

1065.44 --> 1071.76
that's not necessarily the same

1068.64 --> 1075.5200000000002
yeah i know i remember it's like

1071.76 --> 1075.52
when was it a couple of months ago

1077.679 --> 1081.8400000000001
right anyway

1088.96 --> 1094.559
sports sections and comic in the comics

1092.84 --> 1097.6789999999999
only

1094.559 --> 1099.9189999999999
that was back in the sucky ages

1097.679 --> 1099.919
hmm

1103.679 --> 1108.0800000000002
yeah i've never been really too much

1105.44 --> 1112.16
about comics

1108.08 --> 1114.32
of them but a lot of comics just creeped

1112.16 --> 1116.96
me out

1114.32 --> 1122.559
they provided a sort of spiritual

1116.96 --> 1125.2
freedom that i wasn't really looking for

1122.559 --> 1126.96
i don't know but i had a lot as a

1125.2 --> 1129.2
younger kid i had a lot of

1126.96 --> 1130.16
issues with a lot of things that were

1129.2 --> 1133.28
out there

1130.16 --> 1133.28
it's always a struggle

1133.52 --> 1137.84
like things that people liked just

1138.88 --> 1144.16
at first like as a little kid i had

1141.44 --> 1144.16
trouble like

1144.24 --> 1149.2
i i felt so off with so many people that

1147.2 --> 1151.8400000000001
i was wondering sometimes am i really

1149.2 --> 1151.8400000000001
human

1152.32 --> 1155.6
because everybody was just

1156.72 --> 1163.6000000000001
being like animals and corrupted

1160.24 --> 1166.88
so easily and like

1163.6 --> 1168.799
just they didn't care like that stood

1166.88 --> 1170.3200000000002
out to me as a very little kid now as a

1168.799 --> 1173.44
very little kid

1170.32 --> 1174.0
yeah that's very normal i was already

1173.44 --> 1177.44
aware

1174.0 --> 1179.919
of myself like as

1177.44 --> 1182.0800000000002
starting roughly at five years old it

1179.919 --> 1184.0
wasn't that bothered by it

1182.08 --> 1185.6789999999999
but it started out to me that i was

1184.0 --> 1188.16
basically

1185.679 --> 1190.48
as other kids were just freaking fooling

1188.16 --> 1193.6000000000001
around and just

1190.48 --> 1196.16
being stupid little kids i was like

1193.6 --> 1196.8799999999999
why are is everybody so stupid i feel

1196.16 --> 1199.3600000000001
the need

1196.88 --> 1202.48
to express myself to communicate about

1199.36 --> 1205.4399999999998
psychology and what's going on and

1202.48 --> 1207.039
i have complaints like yeah i'm a

1205.44 --> 1207.52
five-year-old and i have complaints

1207.039 --> 1209.44
about

1207.52 --> 1212.48
how everybody's stupid and nobody wants

1209.44 --> 1212.48
to have a conversation

1212.64 --> 1217.3600000000001
or try to have a conversation

1214.72 --> 1217.3600000000001
everybody's just

1217.679 --> 1223.039
like what why aren't you trying to

1219.84 --> 1223.039
properly communicate

1225.36 --> 1230.8799999999999
it's weird and then as soon as everybody

1229.44 --> 1232.0800000000002
reached the age where they were trying

1230.88 --> 1235.0390000000002
that everybody get

1232.08 --> 1237.039
cut gets caught up in like group

1235.039 --> 1241.2
behavior

1237.039 --> 1241.2
and then i became like the odd one out

1241.76 --> 1246.84
because i i was just always trying to

1244.72 --> 1249.679
get everyone together

1246.84 --> 1252.0
always like that was the default

1249.679 --> 1255.6000000000001
position

1252.0 --> 1258.559
for me because i i couldn't

1255.6 --> 1262.24
really understand that group people in

1258.559 --> 1265.9189999999999
groups have a natural tendency to

1262.24 --> 1267.6
yeah to divide themselves and then later

1265.919 --> 1271.8400000000001
as a teenager that

1267.6 --> 1271.84
that really became my thing

1272.96 --> 1277.1200000000001
yeah it just i became extremely

1275.52 --> 1278.8799999999999
oppositional because it was always the

1277.12 --> 1280.799
odd one out and then first you start to

1278.88 --> 1284.88
be like oh i'm

1280.799 --> 1287.28
i'm doomed and no so i just have then i

1284.88 --> 1288.3200000000002
you take on that position like i like i

1287.28 --> 1290.32
am the odd one out

1288.32 --> 1293.2
like i'm not going to wait for people to

1290.32 --> 1295.6
make me that i'll take that position

1293.2 --> 1296.96
like a rebel like the outsider and then

1295.6 --> 1299.12
yeah

1296.96 --> 1300.559
no wonder the gothic scene then really

1299.12 --> 1304.08
appealed to me when it

1300.559 --> 1306.72
approached it's like great artistry

1304.08 --> 1310.1589999999999
and being the odd one out the

1306.72 --> 1312.32
misunderstood mysterious one

1310.159 --> 1313.44
yeah so no wonder i got pulled into all

1312.32 --> 1315.6789999999999
that

1313.44 --> 1315.679
but

1317.679 --> 1322.24
yeah now i'm here i have all this

1321.52 --> 1324.6399999999999
background

1322.24 --> 1324.64
stuff

1325.84 --> 1328.9599999999998
and it's still hard to just communicate

1328.48 --> 1330.799
and

1328.96 --> 1334.559
every time for example when i'm with my

1330.799 --> 1334.559
dad and we're doing stuff

1335.44 --> 1341.039
my dad's so fluent and just like

1338.88 --> 1343.3600000000001
my dad knows like yeah they're just

1341.039 --> 1344.4
normal people they just want to normally

1343.36 --> 1347.52
communicate

1344.4 --> 1349.039
and he just does it he has no objection

1347.52 --> 1351.12
whatsoever

1349.039 --> 1353.28
and he never really had that he was

1351.12 --> 1355.76
always

1353.28 --> 1357.52
with ease able to accept that people are

1355.76 --> 1360.0
just people

1357.52 --> 1361.84
this is and that you're not really going

1360.0 --> 1364.24
to change them they're just looking for

1361.84 --> 1367.6789999999999
a nice smile for something simple

1364.24 --> 1370.48
and then i'm there brooding on like why

1367.679 --> 1372.5590000000002
aren't they different so it's still a

1370.48 --> 1376.159
five-year-old in me

1372.559 --> 1376.559
from way back like why isn't everybody

1376.159 --> 1380.0
just

1376.559 --> 1380.0
like oh yeah we're all

1380.08 --> 1383.6789999999999
in it together and keep your faculties

1383.28 --> 1385.52
don't

1383.679 --> 1387.76
spiral out of control at the same time

1385.52 --> 1388.08
like sort of the level that happens a

1387.76 --> 1391.28
lot

1388.08 --> 1391.28
more here on the internet

1391.52 --> 1396.0
but it's so different different a way of

1394.48 --> 1399.039
communicating as it is

1396.0 --> 1402.08
just normal face to face just normal and

1399.039 --> 1402.48
settling for just normal for me it's

1402.08 --> 1404.799
just

1402.48 --> 1406.0
very tough to step out of the bigger

1404.799 --> 1410.96
picture

1406.0 --> 1413.44
into something simple just be a guy

1410.96 --> 1414.64
and just let the other people be them

1413.44 --> 1417.76
and have a simple

1414.64 --> 1419.039
interaction and not make something big

1417.76 --> 1422.64
out of it it's tough

1419.039 --> 1424.1589999999999
for me it's very tough sometimes

1422.64 --> 1426.159
especially when i'm a little tense

1424.159 --> 1427.8400000000001
because when i'm really chill out and i

1426.159 --> 1431.8400000000001
do have those moments

1427.84 --> 1431.84
then it's no issue whatsoever

1434.08 --> 1439.9189999999999
but i am on average

1437.279 --> 1440.48
kind of driven by tension because i

1439.919 --> 1442.24
learned

1440.48 --> 1443.52
kind of mistakingly you could say

1442.24 --> 1446.559
retrospect

1443.52 --> 1449.12
but as it all arrived i used it

1446.559 --> 1450.08
for my artistry my tension and even my

1449.12 --> 1451.9189999999999
like oh

1450.08 --> 1453.4399999999998
i'm so isolated i can't do anything i

1451.919 --> 1454.4
want to do all these things i can't do

1453.44 --> 1457.279
it

1454.4 --> 1458.24
escape into something fantastical like i

1457.279 --> 1463.679
would create

1458.24 --> 1463.679
my way out of it using my fantasy

1463.84 --> 1469.9189999999999
and drawings

1467.44 --> 1472.64
like video game drawings even like i

1469.919 --> 1475.039
wanted to make things

1472.64 --> 1476.88
but it yeah just expressed it in

1475.039 --> 1479.919
creativity

1476.88 --> 1482.0800000000002
but yeah it is an escapist mechanism and

1479.919 --> 1484.7990000000002
now that escapist mechanism has been

1482.08 --> 1484.799
tied into

1485.12 --> 1492.32
action into creative action but

1489.039 --> 1496.08
it triggers when i try to escape when i

1492.32 --> 1498.3999999999999
feel like i can't handle it and that's

1496.08 --> 1501.4399999999998
exactly the counter opposite of the

1498.4 --> 1504.5590000000002
attitude of being spiritually pure

1501.44 --> 1506.559
so i really made it complicated for

1504.559 --> 1509.6789999999999
myself it's like

1506.559 --> 1512.3999999999999
there's no easy way through it for me

1509.679 --> 1513.279
and it's almost like it was meant to be

1512.4 --> 1516.0800000000002
like

1513.279 --> 1518.48
i've made things very complicated for

1516.08 --> 1522.3999999999999
myself and i think that i needed some

1518.48 --> 1522.4
that to do that sometimes because

1522.72 --> 1531.76
i need the challenge on a higher level

1529.039 --> 1533.84
and also the challenge of just like how

1531.76 --> 1537.84
do i look at myself

1533.84 --> 1540.0
am i stuck or am i exactly where i need

1537.84 --> 1542.0
to be

1540.0 --> 1543.279
because i used to feel stuck but now i

1542.0 --> 1546.0
have a plan

1543.279 --> 1546.72
i really do a long-term plan it and it

1546.0 --> 1549.279
is kind of

1546.72 --> 1549.84
it was basic and it's getting bigger but

1549.279 --> 1552.72
it's still

1549.84 --> 1554.3999999999999
slow it's still based on that i am very

1552.72 --> 1556.48
much used to staying the same because

1554.4 --> 1557.919
every time i try something really big

1556.48 --> 1560.0
something really new

1557.919 --> 1561.1200000000001
i might get a big boost remember like

1560.0 --> 1563.52
when i got sick

1561.12 --> 1565.76
i got better i had so much energy i felt

1563.52 --> 1568.32
like i turned super saiyan

1565.76 --> 1569.6
like for real guys that that was some

1568.32 --> 1572.799
intense

1569.6 --> 1574.32
energy experience and it persisted quite

1572.799 --> 1576.96
long

1574.32 --> 1578.8799999999999
but it started to die down like after

1576.96 --> 1580.64
two weeks

1578.88 --> 1582.4
and then it's just hey it's just me

1580.64 --> 1585.3600000000001
again

1582.4 --> 1586.159
but i'm not letting it yeah because it

1585.36 --> 1588.1589999999999
died down

1586.159 --> 1589.919
because i did kind of needed it to die

1588.159 --> 1592.96
down because it was just too much to

1589.919 --> 1596.48
handle for on the long run

1592.96 --> 1599.6000000000001
and such things don't last forever it

1596.48 --> 1602.64
never really does

1599.6 --> 1603.4399999999998
so i just got back to my normal level

1602.64 --> 1606.72
before that

1603.44 --> 1608.64
except without so much friction because

1606.72 --> 1610.559
yeah it is like a release it does

1608.64 --> 1611.8400000000001
straighten things out it clears things

1610.559 --> 1614.08
up

1611.84 --> 1615.6
then you have more room and then the

1614.08 --> 1617.36
energy dies down and you're back to

1615.6 --> 1619.9189999999999
normal except spiritually kind of

1617.36 --> 1619.9189999999999
cleaned up

1620.24 --> 1625.52
and yeah i'm not letting that discourage

1624.08 --> 1629.12
me because

1625.52 --> 1631.9189999999999
i have a plan for myself on the long run

1629.12 --> 1635.039
whatever happens to me i have something

1631.919 --> 1637.279
where i'm going like i'm

1635.039 --> 1638.48
i'm moving out of poverty i'm not going

1637.279 --> 1641.44
to be a super rich

1638.48 --> 1642.48
i probably never i'm gonna spend a lot

1641.44 --> 1644.96
of time as i

1642.48 --> 1647.2
ascend financially and it's not gonna be

1644.96 --> 1649.44
fast i'm gonna spend a lot of time

1647.2 --> 1651.76
trying to identify the higher level

1649.44 --> 1653.52
pitfalls

1651.76 --> 1655.279
what i'm gonna be confronted with and

1653.52 --> 1658.08
not to be tricked because

1655.279 --> 1659.44
it's almost like my ego just wants me to

1658.08 --> 1662.48
be tricked like it

1659.44 --> 1664.159
loves to be gullible it's super

1662.48 --> 1667.1200000000001
agitating

1664.159 --> 1670.24
and yeah that expressed itself again

1667.12 --> 1673.12
what is it three days ago

1670.24 --> 1674.96
like i want to surrender to the spell

1673.12 --> 1677.6789999999999
it's like this my ego inside just

1674.96 --> 1680.799
longs for the like oh let finally i can

1677.679 --> 1682.96
be part of the ride

1680.799 --> 1684.32
but it's autopilot it's effectively

1682.96 --> 1686.3990000000001
autopilot

1684.32 --> 1688.48
and it is a form of escapism and it

1686.399 --> 1690.399
doesn't really lead anywhere it just

1688.48 --> 1691.919
makes you start fooling yourself and

1690.399 --> 1692.799
then eventually if you don't want to get

1691.919 --> 1694.88
out of it

1692.799 --> 1696.799
you start to break up your reality to

1694.88 --> 1698.7990000000002
continue fooling yourself

1696.799 --> 1700.6399999999999
and then i'm kind of like a baller on

1698.799 --> 1702.24
that level i don't want to do that i

1700.64 --> 1704.0
don't want to get stuck into some kind

1702.24 --> 1707.2
of illusion and start wrecking my life

1704.0 --> 1707.2
to maintain the illusion

1708.84 --> 1713.1999999999998
right

1711.76 --> 1715.039
yeah i had a good conversation with

1713.2 --> 1718.72
robert stanley yesterday

1715.039 --> 1718.72
i already started to break this

1718.96 --> 1725.8400000000001
it's just a lot of introspective stuff

1721.279 --> 1725.84
that i'm working through right now

1726.32 --> 1729.9189999999999
because of again like i feel stuck

1728.559 --> 1732.48
sometimes like why

1729.919 --> 1733.1200000000001
is not things not progressing why

1732.48 --> 1735.44
haven't i

1733.12 --> 1736.399
overcome this specific obstacle that is

1735.44 --> 1739.039
probably life

1736.399 --> 1740.559
lasting but i don't want it to be like

1739.039 --> 1744.72
that i want to just

1740.559 --> 1748.08
move on just be able to just do it

1744.72 --> 1751.279
but the problem is is that

1748.08 --> 1753.84
big steps also have big influences on

1751.279 --> 1753.84
everything else

1757.76 --> 1761.76
and yeah it's tied in my escape is in my

1760.48 --> 1764.88
inability to do anything

1761.76 --> 1767.919
also provides some creative insight

1764.88 --> 1771.1200000000001
right and if i then

1767.919 --> 1772.7990000000002
just overcome the obstacles i feel like

1771.12 --> 1775.6
that creative insight would be

1772.799 --> 1777.6
shut off almost like a punishment that's

1775.6 --> 1778.32
how i experience that now and i've had

1777.6 --> 1781.1999999999998
this sort of

1778.32 --> 1782.8799999999999
i had this thing with my ex because i

1781.2 --> 1786.32
felt so confident

1782.88 --> 1789.2
with her so like i'm there

1786.32 --> 1791.4399999999998
and i felt like the man but my creative

1789.2 --> 1792.3990000000001
side was just it was turned off i just

1791.44 --> 1794.88
had no more

1792.399 --> 1798.559
need to be creative i was just there to

1794.88 --> 1798.5590000000002
do whatever was necessary

1799.36 --> 1802.399
but there was no impulse left for me to

1802.0 --> 1806.0
like

1802.399 --> 1807.84
yeah i need to do something now because

1806.0 --> 1809.6
that's always kind of been intertwined

1807.84 --> 1812.799
with me driven

1809.6 --> 1816.7199999999998
by sort of like an anxiety

1812.799 --> 1819.9189999999999
anxiety with me drives me to figure out

1816.72 --> 1822.08
to do something to get it onto a project

1819.919 --> 1824.159
or at least not always the anxiety

1822.08 --> 1824.48
itself but like the counterbalance of

1824.159 --> 1828.3990000000001
that

1824.48 --> 1831.84
anxiety and then the release of it

1828.399 --> 1833.84
and then yeah the creative creativity

1831.84 --> 1835.12
thinking and the visions really start

1833.84 --> 1837.1999999999998
flowing

1835.12 --> 1839.4399999999998
but if everything is just smooth and out

1837.2 --> 1842.559
and there's no anxiety then

1839.44 --> 1846.48
there's no bubbly moments

1842.559 --> 1848.1589999999999
of extreme creative vision

1846.48 --> 1851.039
with me at least i don't know if it

1848.159 --> 1853.44
works the same with other people

1851.039 --> 1853.44
i think

1854.24 --> 1858.96
the other people probably have a bit

1856.799 --> 1862.399
more

1858.96 --> 1865.039
not so intertwined dynamic

1862.399 --> 1867.36
when it comes to these things with me

1865.039 --> 1869.84
it's become all really intertwined

1867.36 --> 1872.799
mechanically and very confusing because

1869.84 --> 1872.799
it's like a puzzle

1872.96 --> 1876.48
to me like how do i deal with this if i

1875.919 --> 1881.44
do this

1876.48 --> 1884.24
then that ends and i need that

1881.44 --> 1884.24
or do i

1887.6 --> 1894.0
what is you charm or win what

1891.039 --> 1894.0
are you saying mine were

1898.88 --> 1902.3990000000001
you're instinctly not gullible i'd say

1901.519 --> 1904.84
you're accepting

1902.399 --> 1907.84
everyone and people take advantage of

1904.84 --> 1907.84
that

1908.0 --> 1912.88
i'm more accepting of everyone well i'm

1910.399 --> 1915.36
not accepting of bad behavior but i'm

1912.88 --> 1917.679
i'm i do have a tendency at least in

1915.36 --> 1919.279
face-to-face situations to realize more

1917.679 --> 1920.0800000000002
where it's coming from just spot the

1919.279 --> 1923.679
weakness

1920.08 --> 1927.4399999999998
and i'm like seeing myself there

1923.679 --> 1930.96
doing that in the past and i'm like

1927.44 --> 1933.679
yeah if i would say something about that

1930.96 --> 1934.08
went to me when i was like that i would

1933.679 --> 1936.159
be

1934.08 --> 1937.279
pretty annoyed and my day would be

1936.159 --> 1940.72
ruined

1937.279 --> 1940.72
so i'm just going to let people

1941.039 --> 1944.8799999999999
kind of like make their mistake not

1942.799 --> 1946.559
going to approve it

1944.88 --> 1948.5590000000002
but i'm not going to actively do

1946.559 --> 1952.0
anything about it and i think that a lot

1948.559 --> 1952.0
of people do that in general

1953.679 --> 1957.8400000000001
it's a good way to keep the peace but

1956.559 --> 1960.1589999999999
yeah you

1957.84 --> 1964.8799999999999
people do get a tendency to to start

1960.159 --> 1968.72
dwelling in their delusion because of it

1964.88 --> 1968.72
that's the negative side effect

1972.32 --> 1978.6399999999999
except yeah when if people get to know

1976.0 --> 1980.48
me as a t as the teacher that i kind of

1978.64 --> 1982.7990000000002
am here

1980.48 --> 1984.32
when yeah when information starts to

1982.799 --> 1986.6399999999999
really flow when they're

1984.32 --> 1987.4399999999998
when it breaks them for example flat

1986.64 --> 1991.2
earth then

1987.44 --> 1992.0
my entire attitude changes because then

1991.2 --> 1994.159
i realize

1992.0 --> 1995.279
okay they are actually engaging in a

1994.159 --> 1997.2
really big

1995.279 --> 1999.12
complicated revolution mind

1997.2 --> 2001.2
revolutionary process that they might

1999.12 --> 2004.399
not even realize yet

2001.2 --> 2008.0
i am responsible for that

2004.399 --> 2010.2399999999998
so i have to help them through that

2008.0 --> 2012.159
have to be ready as a teacher to help

2010.24 --> 2013.44
them deal with it because i broke it to

2012.159 --> 2015.3600000000001
them

2013.44 --> 2017.6000000000001
and then it's completely different then

2015.36 --> 2019.6
i don't tolerate bad behavior and then i

2017.6 --> 2021.36
start pointing out and start pointing

2019.6 --> 2022.6399999999999
out like this is what it is to be a

2021.36 --> 2026.399
higher

2022.64 --> 2030.0
spirited person a more responsible

2026.399 --> 2030.6399999999999
person but i don't normally do that to

2030.0 --> 2033.679
people

2030.64 --> 2036.48
until they basically prove to me

2033.679 --> 2036.96
that they are at least interested in

2036.48 --> 2047.84
have

2036.96 --> 2047.8400000000001
in bigger things

2057.919 --> 2062.24
i know a lot of people in the groups

2060.72 --> 2064.56
both sides and they all like

2062.24 --> 2064.56
what

2067.679 --> 2070.7200000000003
they all like me or you mean they are

2069.679 --> 2075.839
all they are

2070.72 --> 2075.839
all like me i don't know mine were

2082.0 --> 2089.2
oh all right well i do my best i guess

2086.399 --> 2090.24
but it's also i have to be honest in a

2089.2 --> 2094.56
way

2090.24 --> 2097.9199999999996
it is also a strategy it's just to me

2094.56 --> 2098.64
it's more effective to just respect

2097.92 --> 2101.44
people

2098.64 --> 2102.48
like even if they are your enemy they're

2101.44 --> 2106.2400000000002
not

2102.48 --> 2106.2400000000002
they're just thinking they are

2111.119 --> 2117.44
until yeah they start saying things that

2114.32 --> 2119.3590000000004
make me yeah that touched me and my own

2117.44 --> 2121.28
issues and then i become really annoyed

2119.359 --> 2124.56
by it

2121.28 --> 2126.96
but in general if if that doesn't happen

2124.56 --> 2128.48
then even if they are kind of like i

2126.96 --> 2130.32
don't like you or i think this is stupid

2128.48 --> 2132.8
or i don't understand or i don't want to

2130.32 --> 2132.8
understand

2134.16 --> 2139.92
it's okay they're just not there yet

2140.48 --> 2144.079
and i guess that in the face of a lot of

2142.88 --> 2146.56
other people's behavior

2144.079 --> 2147.3590000000004
out there that is being really

2146.56 --> 2149.2
appreciated

2147.359 --> 2151.2
because a lot of people don't take the

2149.2 --> 2154.359
effort or they're just having so much

2151.2 --> 2157.359
struggle with their with their own

2154.359 --> 2160.96
representation

2157.359 --> 2162.7999999999997
towards others in these scenarios

2160.96 --> 2164.4
and i'm putting a lot of effort in it

2162.8 --> 2167.76
always have always

2164.4 --> 2171.2000000000003
tied it in with honor like it is honor

2167.76 --> 2174.32
it's my sense of honor is doing it right

2171.2 --> 2178.56
and like presenting yourself

2174.32 --> 2182.0
with honor i guess honesty

2178.56 --> 2184.16
and always doing your like

2182.0 --> 2186.079
being human making mistakes and always

2184.16 --> 2189.04
trying to correct the mistakes and

2186.079 --> 2190.8
overcoming and helping out

2189.04 --> 2192.56
and realize that everybody's learning

2190.8 --> 2195.119
lessons

2192.56 --> 2196.7999999999997
or that they should be it's just point

2195.119 --> 2199.44
out the mistakes don't

2196.8 --> 2201.76
don't use it to destroy them but use it

2199.44 --> 2204.8
to help them

2201.76 --> 2206.88
and yeah i think that probably in this

2204.8 --> 2209.52
time period and on the internet

2206.88 --> 2210.2400000000002
that's an attitude and a skill that is

2209.52 --> 2212.88
very much

2210.24 --> 2214.24
needed in general more people need to do

2212.88 --> 2217.2000000000003
that

2214.24 --> 2220.3199999999997
and trying in the process not to get

2217.2 --> 2222.56
extremely convoluted and standardized

2220.32 --> 2224.079
because that can also be problematic

2222.56 --> 2228.0
because then people just go

2224.079 --> 2231.76
to sleep should be a constant

2228.0 --> 2233.76
challenge it should be dynamic

2231.76 --> 2235.44
it's a growth process everybody's in it

2233.76 --> 2238.48
and it all depends on the attitude

2235.44 --> 2239.76
on the frequency and it will always

2238.48 --> 2242.48
change it shouldn't be

2239.76 --> 2243.76
a standardized narrative type thing that

2242.48 --> 2248.0
doesn't really work

2243.76 --> 2248.0
it that just puts people to sleep

2254.72 --> 2260.0
it's like a rough example it's like if

2258.0 --> 2261.359
if it was just the message everything

2260.0 --> 2262.64
will be all right like doesn't really

2261.359 --> 2264.3199999999997
matter everything will be all right that

2262.64 --> 2266.64
just puts you to sleep

2264.32 --> 2268.96
now if you'd say everything will be all

2266.64 --> 2268.96
right

2269.04 --> 2273.359
but how maybe everything will be all

2272.8 --> 2276.32
right

2273.359 --> 2277.44
in a way that it will never really be

2276.32 --> 2281.44
all right

2277.44 --> 2281.44
but as soon as you can accept that

2281.52 --> 2287.68
it'll be all right

2285.119 --> 2288.88
see now you got a much more complicated

2287.68 --> 2292.48
puzzle

2288.88 --> 2295.599
presented like what does that mean

2292.48 --> 2296.16
what does he mean with that and then oh

2295.599 --> 2299.28
but

2296.16 --> 2302.48
oh god that's so difficult

2299.28 --> 2303.76
see these are typical sentiments and

2302.48 --> 2306.32
experiences that i think

2303.76 --> 2308.079
a lot of people are having and yeah now

2306.32 --> 2308.7200000000003
with the corona situation that's an

2308.079 --> 2310.2400000000002
exactly

2308.72 --> 2313.04
one of these examples it's like

2310.24 --> 2316.16
something is intolerable

2313.04 --> 2316.8
that this is happening but you have no

2316.16 --> 2319.839
choice

2316.8 --> 2324.4
don't surrender to it

2319.839 --> 2327.2
but you have to accept that there is

2324.4 --> 2327.76
nothing really that you can do that is

2327.2 --> 2331.04
going to

2327.76 --> 2331.0400000000004
actually make it stop

2334.96 --> 2339.04
it's just taking the pressure and that's

2336.88 --> 2339.04
it

2339.2 --> 2345.2
and then trusting that

2343.04 --> 2347.04
yeah that it's not just going to end up

2345.2 --> 2349.1189999999997
totally crushing everybody in the end

2347.04 --> 2350.96
because that wouldn't make any sense

2349.119 --> 2352.8
so everybody's trying to figure out like

2350.96 --> 2354.88
where is this truly going

2352.8 --> 2356.2400000000002
like this cannot truly be the start of

2354.88 --> 2358.7200000000003
the end it

2356.24 --> 2360.0
that would make no logical spiritual

2358.72 --> 2362.8799999999997
sense

2360.0 --> 2362.88
from all sides

2366.72 --> 2372.7999999999997
and i think that the whole idea that it

2368.72 --> 2372.7999999999997
is basically a giant tricking system

2373.2 --> 2377.2799999999997
that nobody's nobody's going to be

2375.44 --> 2380.7200000000003
forced to do anything

2377.28 --> 2383.0400000000004
but everybody's going to be tricked into

2380.72 --> 2384.72
doing it for whatever reason because

2383.04 --> 2386.16
they believe they have no choice because

2384.72 --> 2386.8799999999997
there are things that they don't want to

2386.16 --> 2390.48
let go of

2386.88 --> 2394.96
that they have attained like

2390.48 --> 2399.359
physical goods or a job or whatever

2394.96 --> 2403.119
a position and that's the trick

2399.359 --> 2404.96
and the more time passes

2403.119 --> 2410.319
the more it does really seem to be

2404.96 --> 2412.319
exactly that

2410.319 --> 2414.319
doesn't seem like anybody is getting

2412.319 --> 2416.48
forced to do anything or is going to be

2414.319 --> 2418.96
forced to do anything even though

2416.48 --> 2420.0
those suggestions have always been

2418.96 --> 2424.88
leaking

2420.0 --> 2427.44
have always been dripping down from the

2424.88 --> 2428.8
from the political class you could say

2427.44 --> 2432.319
that sort of [ __ ]

2428.8 --> 2434.079
through the their plan

2432.319 --> 2439.68
their standardized plan of where they

2434.079 --> 2443.119
want to bring everyone and everything

2439.68 --> 2444.16
but the actual forcing where is it

2443.119 --> 2447.44
exactly

2444.16 --> 2447.44
not too sure if it's there

2447.76 --> 2451.2000000000003
don't see government literally forcing

2450.24 --> 2456.4799999999996
things

2451.2 --> 2459.1189999999997
it's corporations and people

2456.48 --> 2459.119
that do it

2460.24 --> 2463.31
[Music]

2463.52 --> 2468.079
you're gonna write a book if you have

2465.119 --> 2468.079
time okay zach

2472.48 --> 2476.4
or we need to write a book well this is

2474.64 --> 2479.2799999999997
my book

2476.4 --> 2479.28
i'm writing it

2479.599 --> 2484.1600000000003
i'm writing it speaking it out doing it

2481.92 --> 2484.16
live

2485.92 --> 2489.119
that's how i always try to do things

2488.64 --> 2492.72
like

2489.119 --> 2496.079
did you know that as i was very young

2492.72 --> 2498.72
i i did that when i was seven i think

2496.079 --> 2499.92
with my mom and i did it like that i

2498.72 --> 2504.56
would just speak

2499.92 --> 2504.56
my mind and then she would write it down

2505.44 --> 2513.599
worked great some really silly stuff

2510.0 --> 2515.92
came out but it worked better because if

2513.599 --> 2517.28
i have to at the same time also actually

2515.92 --> 2522.319
write it down

2517.28 --> 2524.8
then my i say

2522.319 --> 2525.839
my the part of my mind that really is

2524.8 --> 2528.88
building with

2525.839 --> 2532.0
words starts to get in between the

2528.88 --> 2535.28
actual creative flow

2532.0 --> 2537.359
and that kind of yeah so just me doing

2535.28 --> 2540.48
it like this

2537.359 --> 2543.5989999999997
works better and then afterward i could

2540.48 --> 2545.76
potentially have a transcription

2543.599 --> 2548.96
and then start to improve on the words

2545.76 --> 2548.96
if i would write it down

2549.68 --> 2554.0789999999997
because it's two different processes one

2551.839 --> 2556.72
is just the literal raw

2554.079 --> 2558.5600000000004
output in the moment and the other is

2556.72 --> 2560.72
detailing the words it's a very

2558.56 --> 2562.96
different way of doing things

2560.72 --> 2564.0
and detailing in words definitely

2562.96 --> 2566.14
distracts from

2564.0 --> 2569.19
just a raw output

2566.14 --> 2569.19
[Music]

2576.48 --> 2582.88
i think faster than i write

2579.839 --> 2586.48
definitely but it's not even about that

2582.88 --> 2589.76
it's not that i cannot catch up

2586.48 --> 2592.88
it's that the flow of thinking

2589.76 --> 2595.0400000000004
gets disrupted by my word

2592.88 --> 2597.44
detailing that gets involved when i

2595.04 --> 2607.2
actually write something down

2597.44 --> 2607.76
or type it and when you write something

2607.2 --> 2610.24
down

2607.76 --> 2611.2000000000003
the problem is is that immediately when

2610.24 --> 2614.4799999999996
you wrote it down

2611.2 --> 2615.2
you get to stare at it you see what you

2614.48 --> 2618.319
wrote down

2615.2 --> 2620.24
now when i speak on camera

2618.319 --> 2621.839
i have a moment on youtube where i can

2620.24 --> 2623.52
see myself back

2621.839 --> 2625.04
like oh this is sort of what it what i

2623.52 --> 2627.68
looked like

2625.04 --> 2629.359
and have a raw short-term memory of what

2627.68 --> 2631.2
i said and the frequency and the sound

2629.359 --> 2634.48
of it

2631.2 --> 2636.96
but if i said something stupid or that i

2634.48 --> 2639.68
feel uncomfortable about what i said or

2636.96 --> 2642.88
it may be wrong and i can correct it

2639.68 --> 2644.72
then it just moves on

2642.88 --> 2646.319
and it's only there as an echo in my

2644.72 --> 2649.04
mind it's not like

2646.319 --> 2650.56
literally visually there constantly for

2649.04 --> 2656.24
the rest of the process

2650.56 --> 2656.24
you see that's the difference

2657.44 --> 2662.48
and then it doesn't distract me as much

2659.28 --> 2667.2000000000003
then i can move on more easily

2662.48 --> 2667.2
right just being very mechanic

2674.839 --> 2677.839
here

2678.48 --> 2680.72
all right

2681.68 --> 2685.7599999999998
so because the thinking faster than i

2683.68 --> 2687.9199999999996
write is not really relevant because

2685.76 --> 2690.48
if i don't get distracted from writing

2687.92 --> 2693.92
something down

2690.48 --> 2697.839
which i do then as long as the flow

2693.92 --> 2697.839
keeps going it's just like this

2697.92 --> 2704.319
amount of stuff and there is a

2701.359 --> 2705.359
bottleneck where it comes through in the

2704.319 --> 2707.68
writing

2705.359 --> 2709.2799999999997
but it'll come through there is no haste

2707.68 --> 2710.0789999999997
it's not like oh no i have to catch up

2709.28 --> 2712.2400000000002
with my writing

2710.079 --> 2713.3590000000004
with my mind absolutely not no once my

2712.24 --> 2715.52
mind got

2713.359 --> 2718.319
got the whole vision attuned the whole

2715.52 --> 2721.68
thing it just can't keep on going going

2718.319 --> 2723.839
as long as it stays focused

2721.68 --> 2725.7599999999998
and when i get distracted by the writing

2723.839 --> 2727.92
down details and like oh is this

2725.76 --> 2729.119
is did i say this right do i have to

2727.92 --> 2732.4
rewrite that

2729.119 --> 2734.96
then the cohesion of the vision gets

2732.4 --> 2738.079
disrupted because my main focus

2734.96 --> 2739.28
detracts the energy on it and focuses it

2738.079 --> 2742.6400000000003
more on

2739.28 --> 2747.8390000000004
the detailing on the chiseling

2742.64 --> 2747.839
you see

2757.28 --> 2761.44
right and i've done a lot of chiseling

2759.359 --> 2763.5989999999997
back in the day i wasn't chiseling so

2761.44 --> 2765.76
much i wasn't really good at it

2763.599 --> 2768.319
i was very disappointed at myself for

2765.76 --> 2771.599
not being good at it

2768.319 --> 2773.599
but i had just a lot of raw output

2771.599 --> 2775.2000000000003
and then i had no problem doing some

2773.599 --> 2777.44
chiseling afterward

2775.2 --> 2779.04
but i've spent so much time here on the

2777.44 --> 2782.0
internet

2779.04 --> 2782.8
where you chisel constantly especially

2782.0 --> 2785.119
because of the

2782.8 --> 2787.2000000000003
well the certain psychological warfare

2785.119 --> 2788.8
scenario set up

2787.2 --> 2790.3999999999996
so you're constantly chiseling now

2788.8 --> 2792.4
because of all that chisel i call it

2790.4 --> 2795.839
chiseling it's just the detailed wording

2792.4 --> 2797.2000000000003
like how are you saying it

2795.839 --> 2800.319
and that works really well when you have

2797.2 --> 2802.16
a short message when you have a big

2800.319 --> 2804.079
thing you're trying to output that does

2802.16 --> 2808.0
not work well at all

2804.079 --> 2810.48
and because i'm so used to the chiseling

2808.0 --> 2811.52
it's now tougher to just have a bigger

2810.48 --> 2814.96
vision and

2811.52 --> 2817.839
and just put it all down gets in the way

2814.96 --> 2817.839
yeah

2822.0 --> 2825.119
and i think that people that typically

2824.72 --> 2828.16
do

2825.119 --> 2831.04
write books or have like like

2828.16 --> 2832.56
make big paintings sometimes they know

2831.04 --> 2834.72
that what i'm talking about that it

2832.56 --> 2837.2
probably works with them

2834.72 --> 2837.2
the same

2838.319 --> 2843.2
because i think that a lot of artists

2841.359 --> 2845.119
when they have really big creative

2843.2 --> 2846.8799999999997
visions they retract

2845.119 --> 2848.8
they retract from everything they were

2846.88 --> 2850.96
doing from the social communications

2848.8 --> 2854.0
they lock themselves up

2850.96 --> 2857.359
in their gallery or what is it in their

2854.0 --> 2860.64
in their creative room and they get just

2857.359 --> 2864.16
maniacally working on that

2860.64 --> 2864.8799999999997
oh for me i would probably do that but

2864.16 --> 2868.319
i'm also

2864.88 --> 2870.4
of the heavy creature of habit so for me

2868.319 --> 2872.24
to actually completely step away from

2870.4 --> 2877.2000000000003
all this

2872.24 --> 2877.2
is tough there has to be some really

2877.68 --> 2882.3999999999996
strong determination that would make me

2880.48 --> 2887.839
just step away

2882.4 --> 2887.839
from all this to work on something

2888.079 --> 2892.079
something bigger and i don't really have

2891.28 --> 2894.7200000000003
a lot of that

2892.079 --> 2895.599
i don't really have cohesive big ideas

2894.72 --> 2897.68
currently

2895.599 --> 2899.3590000000004
there's like plans of like i should do

2897.68 --> 2902.16
this i should do that i don't really

2899.359 --> 2906.16
have a vision for it

2902.16 --> 2906.16
it's still all in the works i'm still

2906.559 --> 2913.2000000000003
i'm still juggling the pieces around

2910.0 --> 2915.28
figuring out all the pieces

2913.2 --> 2917.2799999999997
i have to figure out all the pieces and

2915.28 --> 2918.48
be satisfied that there is no more

2917.28 --> 2921.28
before i can actually

2918.48 --> 2921.28
start really

2921.599 --> 2927.76
doing something like a book with it

2924.72 --> 2930.8799999999997
like in my cosmogeny exploits

2927.76 --> 2933.599
there's so much open-endedness

2930.88 --> 2935.839
to it to like okay under these

2933.599 --> 2938.079
conditions like if this was proven

2935.839 --> 2941.2
then all these possibilities well that's

2938.079 --> 2943.8390000000004
just extremely difficult to put that all

2941.2 --> 2943.839
down

2945.92 --> 2950.079
it would probably almost get boring to

2949.04 --> 2952.48
put it all down

2950.079 --> 2954.1600000000003
in a consistent way because it's just

2952.48 --> 2956.96
like okay here is

2954.16 --> 2958.48
24 different examples of what it would

2956.96 --> 2962.0
be like

2958.48 --> 2964.72
let's a few it's gonna just get

2962.0 --> 2967.359
boring and you're gonna misconstrue one

2964.72 --> 2967.359
with the other

2968.839 --> 2974.5589999999997
see now while i explain it i can just

2972.72 --> 2978.16
take a fragment

2974.559 --> 2981.2000000000003
an example short things up a lot

2978.16 --> 2982.319
and then have a shorter cohesive vision

2981.2 --> 2985.33
example

2982.319 --> 2986.8
well in a book it doesn't work that way

2985.33 --> 2988.5589999999997
[Music]

2986.8 --> 2990.0
if it's a book about the whole thing

2988.559 --> 2992.8
then it's going to be just

2990.0 --> 2992.8
the whole thing

2996.839 --> 2999.839
anyway

3002.03 --> 3005.76
[Music]

3003.359 --> 3007.92
when it's all time it's all time i'm

3005.76 --> 3007.92
just

3009.52 --> 3013.839
i'm just moving on

3016.64 --> 3027.839
what a rhinoceros

3030.66 --> 3033.71
[Music]

3052.839 --> 3055.839
hmm

3061.47 --> 3066.8799999999997
[Music]

3063.44 --> 3070.0
so yeah they're rambling on for an hour

3066.88 --> 3070.0
introspective things

3071.68 --> 3083.839
what the most interesting man on youtube

3076.72 --> 3083.839
really nah

3089.76 --> 3094.7200000000003
i have my moments but i'm definitely not

3092.079 --> 3098.1600000000003
the most interesting

3094.72 --> 3101.1189999999997
then again i maybe it's because i'm kind

3098.16 --> 3101.1189999999997
of saturated

3104.8 --> 3110.0
of yeah i i don't know i i never thought

3108.8 --> 3114.079
i was that interesting

3110.0 --> 3116.8
but i've been doing my best to

3114.079 --> 3118.96
also utilize my skills to please so

3116.8 --> 3125.8390000000004
maybe i am more interesting to other

3118.96 --> 3125.839
people than i am to myself

3134.8 --> 3140.559
yeah as a comparison as a metaphorical

3138.079 --> 3142.079
comparison don't take it too serious but

3140.559 --> 3146.1600000000003
like a really

3142.079 --> 3148.079
amazing statue it's an amazing statue

3146.16 --> 3148.72
and everybody sees that amazing statue

3148.079 --> 3151.92
and it's like

3148.72 --> 3154.16
wow that is so impressive imposing in my

3151.92 --> 3158.16
fantasy whoa

3154.16 --> 3161.04
big archetypal association

3158.16 --> 3162.7999999999997
yeah but to the statue they're just a

3161.04 --> 3165.599
statue

3162.8 --> 3166.0
and let's just imagine that they have a

3165.599 --> 3167.92
spirit

3166.0 --> 3169.92
and everything they're just seeing

3167.92 --> 3171.76
themselves it's just like yeah and this

3169.92 --> 3174.16
statue it's always the freaking same i'm

3171.76 --> 3176.3190000000004
just this statue

3174.16 --> 3181.839
they're not going to be as impressed and

3176.319 --> 3181.839
inspired by themselves

3195.119 --> 3203.119
and yeah i i don't really like acting

3199.599 --> 3205.04
in a sense that i'm just going to act

3203.119 --> 3206.96
like i'm super confident and keep

3205.04 --> 3209.839
pushing it and keep pushing it to kind

3206.96 --> 3209.839
of

3209.92 --> 3215.119
mask that i do have

3213.04 --> 3216.079
points where i'm not confident or where

3215.119 --> 3220.319
i'm ashamed of

3216.079 --> 3224.48
it or i feel like i wasted

3220.319 --> 3224.48
a lot of my potential here and there

3228.24 --> 3232.0
because i do have that sensation

3229.92 --> 3233.04
sometimes and i'm just trying to give it

3232.0 --> 3235.359
an honest place

3233.04 --> 3237.52
not get all complainy pants about it

3235.359 --> 3240.5589999999997
constantly because that is a whole other

3237.52 --> 3240.559
level of annoying

3241.76 --> 3253.76
don't want to take on grabbler habits

3251.04 --> 3256.5589999999997
but hey i got a place for it because

3253.76 --> 3259.5200000000004
when i do bring things up

3256.559 --> 3261.28
i don't like to bring up doom scenarios

3259.52 --> 3263.119
because i don't like

3261.28 --> 3264.96
sitting in doom and just like oh

3263.119 --> 3267.6800000000003
everything's going to [ __ ]

3264.96 --> 3268.16
i used to do that you know back in the

3267.68 --> 3270.24
day

3268.16 --> 3272.96
a lot of people have that issue at some

3270.24 --> 3274.9599999999996
point in their life teenage times

3272.96 --> 3277.119
but it's just completely useless and i

3274.96 --> 3281.52
really use my intellect

3277.119 --> 3284.7200000000003
pretty early on to to always

3281.52 --> 3286.799
yeah to work on that to work on whatever

3284.72 --> 3288.799
seems to be bad and then just look at it

3286.799 --> 3290.799
from any angles and then it helps

3288.799 --> 3292.799
hearing other people's opinions

3290.799 --> 3295.119
sometimes sometimes it doesn't

3292.799 --> 3296.72
because if they just want to say

3295.119 --> 3297.28
something to make you feel better but

3296.72 --> 3299.839
they don't

3297.28 --> 3301.3590000000004
actually know how to make you feel

3299.839 --> 3303.2799999999997
better like how to

3301.359 --> 3305.04
figure out figure out the puzzle how to

3303.28 --> 3308.079
alter the frequency

3305.04 --> 3309.73
then yeah i do pick up on that doesn't

3308.079 --> 3312.82
really matter though

3309.73 --> 3312.82
[Music]

3315.04 --> 3325.68
i just want the way through to be real

3321.599 --> 3325.6800000000003
but i do appreciate the effort

3328.24 --> 3332.0789999999997
like when somebody just is in a helpless

3330.559 --> 3334.4
position to help me out

3332.079 --> 3336.4
make me feel better but they want to

3334.4 --> 3338.7200000000003
when they express something

3336.4 --> 3340.079
they express like they are having

3338.72 --> 3343.359
difficulty

3340.079 --> 3345.92
with that then i do appreciate

3343.359 --> 3347.119
that people do care that they actually

3345.92 --> 3349.2000000000003
care and that

3347.119 --> 3350.6400000000003
they don't have to tell me and then i

3349.2 --> 3352.96
don't have to believe them no

3350.64 --> 3354.8799999999997
it's proven by their actions by their

3352.96 --> 3358.48
composure and all that

3354.88 --> 3358.48
that's what i look at much more

3359.28 --> 3363.8390000000004
or almost exclusively these days

3375.2 --> 3378.5589999999997
saturated sex what

3379.68 --> 3384.16
[Music]

3382.24 --> 3391.839
why did this life happen why is life

3384.16 --> 3391.839
even a thing well

3400.079 --> 3406.88
why did it happen oh is that it

3404.16 --> 3407.52
is that even an attainable unanswerable

3406.88 --> 3410.799
question

3407.52 --> 3410.799
it happened because it happened

3411.04 --> 3422.319
and from a timeless perspective

3419.2 --> 3424.319
yeah it's just i don't know from a

3422.319 --> 3427.2
timeless perspective i'd say

3424.319 --> 3430.64
it's just the linear experience is there

3427.2 --> 3430.64
to give another view on it

3431.119 --> 3435.119
on what it is to be and to change

3440.96 --> 3448.799
and overcoming obstacles is is a core

3445.359 --> 3448.799
thing is the core struggle

3450.0 --> 3461.839
it's the only way up because if you

3451.92 --> 3461.839
don't then you go down

3472.839 --> 3477.7599999999998
what

3475.119 --> 3481.2000000000003
everything is just here just ingredients

3477.76 --> 3481.2000000000003
laying around well not exactly

3481.28 --> 3488.2400000000002
it's just resonation it like

3484.4 --> 3489.119
we echo everything that happened before

3488.24 --> 3492.5589999999997
us

3489.119 --> 3495.28
naturally our spirit resonates

3492.559 --> 3498.1600000000003
and we are in our spirit looking for

3495.28 --> 3501.52
something to resonate with

3498.16 --> 3504.16
so we just echo things give it

3501.52 --> 3505.7599999999998
our own twist alter it but eventually

3504.16 --> 3508.0789999999997
like the echoes in the different

3505.76 --> 3511.28
fashions are persistent

3508.079 --> 3511.28
and in a lot of ways

3512.559 --> 3520.7200000000003
people like echo

3517.04 --> 3520.72
for example their grandparents

3522.24 --> 3527.7599999999998
and this just keeps happening

3525.68 --> 3529.5989999999997
it's just sort of the same person

3527.76 --> 3533.2000000000003
slightly different

3529.599 --> 3545.839
in a situation and then yeah it happens

3533.2 --> 3545.839
again yeah two generations later

3551.44 --> 3555.599
and this is also in my opinion the way

3554.319 --> 3559.839
to

3555.599 --> 3559.839
really transcend is by

3560.0 --> 3564.88
having multiple generations that are all

3562.559 --> 3569.2000000000003
very attuned to one another

3564.88 --> 3572.559
where the elderly can truly

3569.2 --> 3574.64
find yeah find their

3572.559 --> 3575.92
grandchildren for example they resonate

3574.64 --> 3579.359
with

3575.92 --> 3579.6800000000003
and then help them figure out things

3579.359 --> 3581.5989999999997
that

3579.68 --> 3583.2
they had issues with when they were

3581.599 --> 3586.799
younger and then

3583.2 --> 3591.1189999999997
that way there can be like a real

3586.799 --> 3591.119
family power a family power

3591.44 --> 3595.599
where you can within the family that's

3593.52 --> 3599.119
very strictly family usually

3595.599 --> 3603.6800000000003
you can just have a family culture of

3599.119 --> 3606.7200000000003
just help lift the little ones up

3603.68 --> 3607.1189999999997
in the ways that they need it because

3606.72 --> 3610.799
only

3607.119 --> 3613.599
family can do that because the same type

3610.799 --> 3615.7599999999998
of characteristics echo on so it's like

3613.599 --> 3618.559
multiple people that are exactly the

3615.76 --> 3621.76
same are in the same group

3618.559 --> 3623.6800000000003
or a couple or some

3621.76 --> 3625.3590000000004
not everybody it depends on how big the

3623.68 --> 3627.9199999999996
family is of course too

3625.359 --> 3629.68
if it's like families of 10 or something

3627.92 --> 3631.52
then it becomes even more

3629.68 --> 3633.04
people that are just very alike they're

3631.52 --> 3636.319
all suffering

3633.04 --> 3637.52
with the same lessons and some will be

3636.319 --> 3639.359
older than others

3637.52 --> 3641.92
and will be further along and they can

3639.359 --> 3642.799
all help each other with very practical

3641.92 --> 3644.7200000000003
information

3642.799 --> 3646.799
that is even more attainable to them

3644.72 --> 3649.04
because they are so much alike

3646.799 --> 3652.16
and they're in a family see it's a very

3649.04 --> 3652.16
effective way to help

3654.839 --> 3661.04
defend

3657.76 --> 3663.0400000000004
your family against the yeah

3661.04 --> 3664.24
against the complexities from the all

3663.04 --> 3667.52
the outside

3664.24 --> 3669.52
from the b system and from just typical

3667.52 --> 3685.839
personal pitfalls that come with certain

3669.52 --> 3685.839
types of character

3701.839 --> 3706.24
be bold nothing gaining stagnation

3710.72 --> 3713.839
all right

3721.119 --> 3726.6400000000003
yeah it's better to do something than to

3722.88 --> 3729.28
do nothing

3726.64 --> 3729.839
but yeah for me at least if i go too

3729.28 --> 3733.92
fast

3729.839 --> 3737.68
then i basically

3733.92 --> 3737.6800000000003
take on more than i can handle

3738.72 --> 3744.16
with me proficiency makes me a lot

3742.079 --> 3746.6400000000003
better able to handle things but it

3744.16 --> 3748.48
takes time to build that

3746.64 --> 3750.24
there's a lot i need to learn about it

3748.48 --> 3752.0
and get comfortable with it's not just

3750.24 --> 3753.0389999999998
oh i learned the mechanics and then i

3752.0 --> 3756.559
know how to do it

3753.039 --> 3756.559
and then i can just move on

3756.64 --> 3763.359
i need room in my spirit too

3760.0 --> 3766.0
i have those types of skills

3763.359 --> 3767.52
they don't like to just be squashed and

3766.0 --> 3770.96
compressed to the site

3767.52 --> 3772.72
to have like all this amount of raw data

3770.96 --> 3775.599
constantly coming in

3772.72 --> 3776.48
it needs time to sync with me in that

3775.599 --> 3779.599
sense i am

3776.48 --> 3782.2400000000002
a slow learner it's just that

3779.599 --> 3785.28
once there's room for it then the

3782.24 --> 3785.2799999999997
learning is instant

3785.599 --> 3788.7200000000003
it's almost instant

3792.72 --> 3796.0789999999997
it's always been like that it's very

3795.28 --> 3798.48
weird

3796.079 --> 3799.92
it's just constantly like unwillingness

3798.48 --> 3801.76
that's what it comes

3799.92 --> 3803.28
across like it's just like no i don't

3801.76 --> 3805.119
want to learn this

3803.28 --> 3806.6400000000003
then at some point like i want to learn

3805.119 --> 3811.839
this and i learn it bang

3806.64 --> 3811.839
and i know it

3814.24 --> 3819.5989999999997
because there is certainly like a

3816.319 --> 3825.839
spiritual necessity for it and then

3819.599 --> 3825.839
i have something to tie it in with

3826.16 --> 3833.2799999999997
the information if it's just data then

3829.68 --> 3834.96
it doesn't really mean anything to me

3833.28 --> 3836.559
if i need to learn something because i

3834.96 --> 3840.2400000000002
want to get something out of it then i

3836.559 --> 3840.2400000000002
don't really know what to look out for

3841.039 --> 3849.119
unless i have a real vision

3844.319 --> 3849.119
for it like i see how i need this

3849.44 --> 3854.88
only when you see how you need it then

3852.559 --> 3856.799
that's the time for me if i just think

3854.88 --> 3860.2400000000002
oh this is really useful to have

3856.799 --> 3860.72
then it doesn't work for me i have to

3860.24 --> 3863.5989999999997
see

3860.72 --> 3863.5989999999997
how it fits in

3864.839 --> 3881.839
anyway ah being very introspective today

3890.71 --> 3895.839
[Music]

3892.839 --> 3895.839
uh

3898.24 --> 3909.839
earth is self-creating what

3901.68 --> 3909.839
uh no i don't think so

3918.4 --> 3922.7200000000003
but there is a lot of recycling going on

3920.839 --> 3924.96
though

3922.72 --> 3927.839
the design is extremely efficient for

3924.96 --> 3937.839
what is in here

3927.839 --> 3937.839
it's not self-creating though

3948.079 --> 3965.8390000000004
yeah hello by the way on one rockcon

3971.039 --> 3979.8390000000004
right so enough introspective talk

3981.2 --> 3993.839
i'm learning patience

3984.64 --> 3993.839
patience is a big factor for me

4019.52 --> 4035.839
so any specifics

4022.799 --> 4035.839
talking about earth and life and

4040.079 --> 4043.52
right yeah well i'll just get into that

4042.64 --> 4048.0
then

4043.52 --> 4050.799
is my chat frozen it's just me now

4048.0 --> 4054.48
right earth is not a creator of life

4050.799 --> 4057.44
earth is a container of life

4054.48 --> 4057.44
it has it in it

4057.52 --> 4064.319
and then life definitely the

4061.52 --> 4066.799
original raw workings of it had to be

4064.319 --> 4066.799
designed

4068.799 --> 4075.839
had to be figured out

4072.319 --> 4077.2
and then yeah arranged in a certain way

4075.839 --> 4080.4
designed

4077.2 --> 4083.839
so that everything could

4080.4 --> 4086.88
happen in the incredible

4083.839 --> 4090.64
seemingly unlimited dynamics of

4086.88 --> 4093.52
how things work right now in life

4090.64 --> 4093.52
and life forms

4098.159 --> 4102.3189999999995
and yeah who knows whatever else kinds

4101.04 --> 4105.679
of surprises are

4102.319 --> 4106.96
even part of it because i wonder

4105.679 --> 4110.0
sometimes like do

4106.96 --> 4111.44
new species literally just appear out of

4110.0 --> 4113.52
nowhere

4111.44 --> 4115.678999999999
or if they were always there then how

4113.52 --> 4117.1990000000005
could they have been always missed or

4115.679 --> 4120.799
overlooked

4117.199 --> 4121.839
or if they were were perhaps entrapped

4120.799 --> 4124.319
somewhere

4121.839 --> 4127.2789999999995
as part of the design or something that

4124.319 --> 4130.56
would even in cycles naturally happen

4127.279 --> 4132.2390000000005
things would get trapped kept away from

4130.56 --> 4135.6
everything else and then eventually

4132.239 --> 4138.0
released again and that that way

4135.6 --> 4139.679
just it appears like new species have

4138.0 --> 4143.44
arrived even though they probably

4139.679 --> 4147.279
always existed or

4143.44 --> 4149.678999999999
well maybe new species literally just

4147.279 --> 4149.679
appear

4149.92 --> 4153.4400000000005
but how would that work where are they

4151.359 --> 4156.0
coming from then how do they just

4153.44 --> 4158.4
suddenly form

4156.0 --> 4160.56
how do they or how do they shift into

4158.4 --> 4163.44
the regular reality

4160.56 --> 4164.799
that's almost yeah mandela terminology

4163.44 --> 4168.0
i'm not saying that that's

4164.799 --> 4170.88
happening but i do wonder sometimes

4168.0 --> 4172.96
like where is it all coming from like if

4170.88 --> 4173.6
it was all there from the beginning then

4172.96 --> 4175.12
it seems

4173.6 --> 4176.799
logical and this is like even in

4175.12 --> 4178.96
philosophy expressed through

4176.799 --> 4180.319
entropy that just the amounts would just

4178.96 --> 4183.679
die down

4180.319 --> 4185.1990000000005
but how could have ever there have ever

4183.679 --> 4188.4
been such

4185.199 --> 4191.44
insane amounts of things to still

4188.4 --> 4194.08
have this insane amount of

4191.44 --> 4197.199
different life forms left still how is

4194.08 --> 4197.199
that even possible

4198.239 --> 4203.28
unless there is like an exchange

4201.199 --> 4203.678999999999
happening and literally new life forms

4203.28 --> 4207.04
just

4203.679 --> 4211.04
get introduced somehow every time

4207.04 --> 4211.04
a certain amount of other things die out

4211.6 --> 4217.1990000000005
and then yeah evolutionists will

4215.04 --> 4218.8
love to think and reason out about that

4217.199 --> 4220.96
and just say oh of course well there is

4218.8 --> 4223.76
the proof of evolution because

4220.96 --> 4224.64
because of math basically it's like ah

4223.76 --> 4226.719
but there is

4224.64 --> 4228.56
so much so it has to come from somewhere

4226.719 --> 4231.76
so we have a theory about

4228.56 --> 4233.4400000000005
how it evolves in one thing into another

4231.76 --> 4236.8
i'm not going with that because

4233.44 --> 4245.839999999999
evolution is just not real

4236.8 --> 4245.84
it's not even a proper theory

4247.04 --> 4251.76
right one on one rock hat but i'm not

4248.88 --> 4253.92
talking about new life

4251.76 --> 4259.84
specifically i'm talking about new life

4253.92 --> 4259.84
forms in this case

4260.08 --> 4266.159
or at least seeming new life forms

4263.84 --> 4273.84
undiscovered life forms and registered

4266.159 --> 4273.839999999999
life forms

4278.159 --> 4287.839999999999
and in a way it's like uh

4291.12 --> 4296.8
people that typically

4294.159 --> 4298.08
go out and explore the wilds to find

4296.8 --> 4302.320000000001
animals and

4298.08 --> 4304.32
species and all that the the most

4302.32 --> 4306.239
people that are really into that that

4304.32 --> 4306.96
have spent a lot of their life doing

4306.239 --> 4309.5199999999995
that

4306.96 --> 4311.36
they all say like there's unlimited

4309.52 --> 4312.96
amounts they say it they say there is

4311.36 --> 4316.719
unlimited

4312.96 --> 4319.04
amount of life because they just say

4316.719 --> 4321.04
no no you're never going to stop finding

4319.04 --> 4324.4
new life

4321.04 --> 4326.8
but that's crazy that's crazy that

4324.4 --> 4329.599999999999
that's the case is

4326.8 --> 4330.08
it's like how is that possible if there

4329.6 --> 4333.679
is a

4330.08 --> 4335.44
volumetric limit

4333.679 --> 4337.28
to the earth or realm then how can there

4335.44 --> 4340.159
be literally

4337.28 --> 4340.8
unlimited amount of variation that's

4340.159 --> 4343.92
just

4340.8 --> 4348.08
that doesn't seem logical to me

4343.92 --> 4351.679
so where would it be coming from are new

4348.08 --> 4352.88
designs introduced somehow do they just

4351.679 --> 4357.76
manifest

4352.88 --> 4360.32
it just

4357.76 --> 4362.4800000000005
portal opens and it's just bloop there's

4360.32 --> 4371.84
this species and it spreads out

4362.48 --> 4371.839999999999
or i don't know

4381.199 --> 4384.96
you have a lot to say about the subject

4382.8 --> 4388.320000000001
101 rockhound oh i can imagine

4384.96 --> 4388.32
there is a lot to say about it

4390.159 --> 4393.28
but yeah when it comes to new species

4392.32 --> 4396.639999999999
i've always

4393.28 --> 4399.759999999999
found it mysterious

4396.64 --> 4403.04
like even during my visions was very

4399.76 --> 4405.360000000001
mystified by it and intrigued about all

4403.04 --> 4407.44
the species

4405.36 --> 4413.839999999999
and that it seemed like new species

4407.44 --> 4413.839999999999
would be introduced

4414.8 --> 4419.28
and to me it was almost like they were

4417.36 --> 4421.679
being placed like every the normal

4419.28 --> 4424.159
timeline is just halted

4421.679 --> 4425.4400000000005
and these things are just placed in

4424.159 --> 4429.92
there almost like

4425.44 --> 4434.719
being introduced in a holodeck and then

4429.92 --> 4434.719
as it starts back up it was always there

4437.28 --> 4441.759999999999
but yeah i think i probably never will

4439.84 --> 4442.64
be able to completely figure that one

4441.76 --> 4445.280000000001
out

4442.64 --> 4445.280000000001
for myself

4447.28 --> 4450.8
like how that actually happens

4453.36 --> 4458.639999999999
but who knows maybe one day

4456.4 --> 4461.12
it will be discovered that there is like

4458.64 --> 4463.92
this axis point

4461.12 --> 4465.5199999999995
where just typically new species tend to

4463.92 --> 4467.28
just be spotted like

4465.52 --> 4470.8
every time we find a new species we

4467.28 --> 4470.8
always find them here first

4470.96 --> 4474.96
who knows who knows what we will

4473.04 --> 4476.32
discover about this realm and how it

4474.96 --> 4483.84
actually works how

4476.32 --> 4483.84
the cycles work

4492.96 --> 4497.84
undiscovered does not equal new yeah i

4495.199 --> 4497.839999999999
know that

4512.4 --> 4517.599999999999
all right see you later robin stanley

4514.0 --> 4517.6
thanks for being a chat

4522.8 --> 4527.28
frog plus lightning is dinosaur what

4538.32 --> 4543.04
yeah i like that one the logical is this

4540.48 --> 4553.839999999999
reality doesn't seem logical

4543.04 --> 4553.84
well i say it as reality is surreal

4556.96 --> 4560.64
logic is always logical

4562.0 --> 4565.12
it's just that sometimes she can't

4564.159 --> 4567.839999999999
figure out

4565.12 --> 4567.84
how

4573.92 --> 4580.4
because yeah mysteries and logic can get

4577.28 --> 4581.5199999999995
quite com yeah confusing together if you

4580.4 --> 4584.159
try to tie it in

4581.52 --> 4586.88
when you really don't know something can

4584.159 --> 4588.799999999999
be very confusing

4586.88 --> 4589.92
because it can go any direction

4588.8 --> 4592.08
potentially

4589.92 --> 4595.04
so how how do you anchor yourself well

4592.08 --> 4597.199
you don't really

4595.04 --> 4599.56
and if you are unable to accept that

4597.199 --> 4601.759999999999
then you might go on to this

4599.56 --> 4602.96
presuppositional train of thought that

4601.76 --> 4609.84
you're going to hold on to

4602.96 --> 4609.84
for a very very long time

4634.64 --> 4637.84
i don't know somehow

4639.12 --> 4644.159
i think so i think everything has an

4643.36 --> 4646.88
influence

4644.159 --> 4648.839999999999
but it also the influence also depends

4646.88 --> 4652.64
depends on

4648.84 --> 4665.76
how how receiving

4652.64 --> 4668.64
the influences are

4665.76 --> 4669.360000000001
so yeah it all depends on how open is

4668.64 --> 4671.4400000000005
somebody

4669.36 --> 4674.719
giving something and how open are the

4671.44 --> 4674.719
receiving end of that

4675.36 --> 4680.48
and the receiving end tends to matter

4677.92 --> 4680.4800000000005
even more

4685.76 --> 4690.08
if there's a great need for positivity

4687.92 --> 4692.8
from the outside

4690.08 --> 4695.28
then if you think you spot something

4692.8 --> 4698.159000000001
that is positive and you like it

4695.28 --> 4707.84
then it will be very nourishing to you

4698.159 --> 4707.839999999999
because you're in the need for it

4712.159 --> 4717.599999999999
okay 1-1 rock on what all the wind and

4714.88 --> 4720.88
water movement including ocean currents

4717.6 --> 4721.76
and tides heat and massive pressures all

4720.88 --> 4724.0
this movement

4721.76 --> 4725.04
causes there to be many trillions of

4724.0 --> 4728.56
particle

4725.04 --> 4728.56
interactions every second

4729.76 --> 4732.159000000001
really

4733.44 --> 4737.839999999999
want to start counting grains of sand on

4735.44 --> 4737.839999999999
the beach

4746.8 --> 4751.12
when i get into astronomical numbers

4751.28 --> 4754.48
i don't know it seems like a bit of a

4752.719 --> 4757.04
waste of focus

4754.48 --> 4759.04
except for the general realization of

4757.04 --> 4762.08
the difference between

4759.04 --> 4766.96
a few and seemingly unlimited

4762.08 --> 4770.64
statistics statistical difference

4766.96 --> 4773.92
like the influence is different of a

4770.64 --> 4774.88
of bigger groups than smaller groups not

4773.92 --> 4776.64
necessarily more

4774.88 --> 4778.4800000000005
just different it works different than

4776.64 --> 4782.320000000001
the dynamics works different and the

4778.48 --> 4782.32
spiritual dynamics work different

4782.56 --> 4791.84
that's with people and objects

4796.0 --> 4799.76
yeah so now i agree i've i've watched

4798.48 --> 4802.159
i've looked at

4799.76 --> 4805.84
sand too under a microscope it is pretty

4802.159 --> 4805.839999999999
fascinating it's all just crystals

4818.8 --> 4821.04
hmm

4826.88 --> 4833.84
hey good morning how do you fight me

4858.84 --> 4861.84
hmm

4867.88 --> 4870.939
[Music]

4871.28 --> 4875.84
oh that's a great one audio fight me

4876.8 --> 4881.12
yeah i try to emphasize that myself too

4879.6 --> 4881.6
it's like how do you know somebody

4881.12 --> 4885.28
that's

4881.6 --> 4889.280000000001
really smart well

4885.28 --> 4891.12
they'll probably feel really stupid

4889.28 --> 4893.36
because it's the really dumb ones that

4891.12 --> 4898.239
actually think they're smart

4893.36 --> 4898.239
or feel like they are and they're not

4899.12 --> 4917.84
they just settle for feeling the same

4902.32 --> 4917.84
over a lot less intelligent things

4948.8 --> 4956.0
right yes audio fight me correct

4952.48 --> 4958.5599999999995
like intelligence capacity

4956.0 --> 4959.199
when somebody has bigger skills in a

4958.56 --> 4962.080000000001
certain

4959.199 --> 4963.599999999999
way of their intelligence because it is

4962.08 --> 4966.96
compartmentalized then they're

4963.6 --> 4970.56
also very likely to have less quality

4966.96 --> 4973.44
in other faculty-based regions

4970.56 --> 4976.88
they come become specialists like that

4973.44 --> 4976.879999999999
in a very specific way

4978.96 --> 4984.8
that also yeah it's basically the effect

4982.4 --> 4987.599999999999
of the nerd

4984.8 --> 4989.92
it's like really good at one thing

4987.6 --> 4992.8
really not good at the other

4989.92 --> 4994.56
it's also a very common side effect of

4992.8 --> 4998.159000000001
intelligence

4994.56 --> 4998.159000000001
it's like compartmentalized

4999.36 --> 5003.839999999999
because if you're just really broad

5002.48 --> 5006.799999999999
in your intelligence then you'll

5003.84 --> 5009.12
probably also have a lot of side effects

5006.8 --> 5012.719
emotionally

5009.12 --> 5014.88
on the same depth it's like you can't

5012.719 --> 5015.36
have intelligence without a downside

5014.88 --> 5018.0
it's just

5015.36 --> 5018.0
impossible

5024.639 --> 5028.8
but you can learn to overcome that

5026.32 --> 5032.239
downside but it'll still be a downside

5028.8 --> 5032.639
it'll still not have developed as others

5032.239 --> 5034.48
have

5032.639 --> 5037.4400000000005
that do not have that downside it'll

5034.48 --> 5037.44
always be like that

5041.52 --> 5045.1990000000005
but that doesn't mean that you can work

5043.28 --> 5047.889999999999
your way through with that

5045.199 --> 5050.638999999999
just as fine you know

5047.89 --> 5053.4400000000005
[Music]

5050.639 --> 5054.2390000000005
a big part of practical intelligence is

5053.44 --> 5058.239
that you just

5054.239 --> 5062.718999999999
learn what you have and then learn to

5058.239 --> 5062.718999999999
settle for what you really have

5065.36 --> 5072.32
because if you get into a spirit that

5068.4 --> 5074.239
you can accept the downsides you have

5072.32 --> 5076.159
then you start to ignore them and

5074.239 --> 5078.48
usually they take over

5076.159 --> 5081.599999999999
the downsides just become very become

5078.48 --> 5083.678999999999
more aggravated more

5081.6 --> 5085.52
expressed because you're not dealing

5083.679 --> 5089.28
with it then it becomes you

5085.52 --> 5091.1990000000005
you know when you make a mistake and and

5089.28 --> 5094.8
correct the mistake then you become the

5091.199 --> 5094.799999999999
mistake that's that effect

5096.56 --> 5100.159000000001
i lost my train of thought damn it

5101.84 --> 5109.12
uh yeah if you don't learn to accept

5105.92 --> 5111.1990000000005
the downsides you have then

5109.12 --> 5113.679
you either ignore it or you start to

5111.199 --> 5116.159
like start digging

5113.679 --> 5117.1990000000005
to somehow attain it after all but

5116.159 --> 5120.4
that's

5117.199 --> 5122.32
never gonna work you might come across

5120.4 --> 5124.159
all kinds of interesting things but you

5122.32 --> 5127.92
will also be seduced to do things

5124.159 --> 5130.4
probably there not as good

5127.92 --> 5132.4
if you keep holding on to that over

5130.4 --> 5134.239
trying to correct something that

5132.4 --> 5141.839999999999
you basically cannot really correct you

5134.239 --> 5141.839999999999
should just work your way around it

5146.32 --> 5150.96
like with me an example would be the

5149.04 --> 5153.84
difference between my dad and me

5150.96 --> 5154.4
that he's just really easy going with

5153.84 --> 5157.52
people

5154.4 --> 5158.159
like he really knows how to easy go and

5157.52 --> 5162.080000000001
i'm just

5158.159 --> 5162.879999999999
really not naturally good at it i might

5162.08 --> 5165.36
learn to

5162.88 --> 5167.12
deal with it but i'm just never gonna be

5165.36 --> 5170.48
as naturally good at it as

5167.12 --> 5173.36
it as my dad is and i have to

5170.48 --> 5173.678999999999
settle for that i have to realize yeah

5173.36 --> 5176.799999999999
this

5173.679 --> 5179.28
is how i am that is how he is i can't

5176.8 --> 5179.28
get that

5179.76 --> 5183.84
but i might work slightly towards it i

5182.719 --> 5186.96
might get better

5183.84 --> 5188.8
at how bad i am at it or even find some

5186.96 --> 5191.44
other way of even approach

5188.8 --> 5191.4400000000005
entirely

5194.84 --> 5200.0
and one way

5197.44 --> 5201.199
for me that has made it easier for me to

5200.0 --> 5203.679
approach people

5201.199 --> 5205.36
is kind of through business is through

5203.679 --> 5206.0
actually knowing what you're doing there

5205.36 --> 5209.199
having

5206.0 --> 5210.88
a specific task at hand and then in

5209.199 --> 5213.678999999999
between i have moments

5210.88 --> 5216.32
for a banter that are not heavy weight

5213.679 --> 5220.0
heavy weighing on me

5216.32 --> 5220.0
so if i just have things to do

5220.32 --> 5223.759999999999
that actually helps me communicate

5222.56 --> 5227.1990000000005
better

5223.76 --> 5228.0
easier if i have less things to do and

5227.199 --> 5230.5599999999995
then you go

5228.0 --> 5232.719
out to specifically communicate with

5230.56 --> 5235.04
somebody that's when the tension runs up

5232.719 --> 5235.04
high

5236.56 --> 5242.400000000001
so for me tactically it's like okay

5239.92 --> 5245.36
how do i find a proper excuse to get

5242.4 --> 5245.36
close to the person

5245.84 --> 5253.04
which means i would have to actually be

5247.76 --> 5255.280000000001
doing something there

5253.04 --> 5256.96
but not just because you want to get

5255.28 --> 5258.719
closer to the person you have to find

5256.96 --> 5260.32
something there that you want to attain

5258.719 --> 5263.44
for yourself

5260.32 --> 5266.5599999999995
and that's kind of tricky with me

5263.44 --> 5281.839999999999
it's tricky

5266.56 --> 5281.84
anyway uh right be back in two minutes

5306.84 --> 5309.84
so

5362.84 --> 5365.84
damn

5379.04 --> 5381.28
huh

5382.32 --> 5386.08
surrender to your stupidity

5388.719 --> 5393.04
is that really surrendering to stupidity

5390.96 --> 5395.6
or is it just

5393.04 --> 5396.719
not being as defensive as you as you

5395.6 --> 5400.08
audio fight me but

5396.719 --> 5400.08
anyway yeah interesting

5402.8 --> 5408.159000000001
that is a good attitude for learning at

5405.6 --> 5408.159000000001
least but

5410.4 --> 5415.839999999999
but i don't know if i'd call it

5411.92 --> 5415.84
surrendering to stupidity it's just

5415.92 --> 5421.1990000000005
yes lay down your defenses and just

5418.88 --> 5435.84
trust

5421.199 --> 5435.839999999999
that you will be able to figure it out

5460.0 --> 5463.84
okay somehow

5465.04 --> 5470.96
i don't know exactly how to interpret

5468.08 --> 5470.96
what you just said

5473.6 --> 5477.84
the results are natural

5481.76 --> 5484.2390000000005
i don't know

5486.48 --> 5490.0
i don't know yeah well in ways they are

5489.04 --> 5491.76
unnatural but

5490.0 --> 5494.32
that's what obstacles kind of are

5491.76 --> 5494.320000000001
they're like

5503.199 --> 5509.839999999999
i guess that's why they are obstacles

5507.04 --> 5510.8
because they do yeah they are not part

5509.84 --> 5519.84
of the natural

5510.8 --> 5519.84
flow and they obstruct

5527.08 --> 5530.63
[Music]

5530.84 --> 5533.84
right

5536.48 --> 5539.86
[Music]

5544.4 --> 5551.199
therefore less understanding

5547.679 --> 5551.1990000000005
well less oversight

5554.96 --> 5564.0
an obstacle is there to prevent you from

5561.28 --> 5566.719
things that are beyond from just

5564.0 --> 5566.719
reaching you

5570.08 --> 5574.0
so it basically takes away your

5572.639 --> 5576.56
oversight of things and

5574.0 --> 5578.8
in that sense it's like a wall it

5576.56 --> 5581.120000000001
protects you but yeah you also don't see

5578.8 --> 5586.08
what's beyond the wall

5581.12 --> 5586.08
but it does protect you one way or the

5586.84 --> 5603.84
other and that's why

5588.88 --> 5603.84
people hold on to it

5642.84 --> 5645.84
hmm

5649.36 --> 5653.36
oh yeah now you're talking my language

5656.84 --> 5663.12
yeah something more to do with keeping

5660.08 --> 5663.12
your ego in check

5663.44 --> 5665.919999999999
indeed

5669.6 --> 5677.4400000000005
that's why i rephrased it as to

5673.36 --> 5680.88
yeah letting your

5677.44 --> 5683.839999999999
your natural defense responses down

5680.88 --> 5685.6
which are a part of intellect it's like

5683.84 --> 5686.96
you have all these standards all these

5685.6 --> 5688.8
things you're looking out for

5686.96 --> 5691.119
in order to figure out what's going on

5688.8 --> 5693.6
and whether it's good or bad

5691.119 --> 5696.32
yeah if you let that down then you let

5693.6 --> 5697.84
down your guard for a bit

5696.32 --> 5699.599999999999
but hey if you

5697.84 --> 5702.56
[Music]

5699.6 --> 5702.56
yeah you can still

5702.96 --> 5707.92
afterward just figure it out just the

5705.84 --> 5709.76
same

5707.92 --> 5710.96
if you're mentally stable because if

5709.76 --> 5712.84
you're like very

5710.96 --> 5714.08
agitated mood that becomes very

5712.84 --> 5716.639
difficult

5714.08 --> 5718.0
if you're just serene and calm then just

5716.639 --> 5720.639
letting down your guard not

5718.0 --> 5721.52
re approaching things defensively but

5720.639 --> 5723.679
just letting it

5721.52 --> 5725.280000000001
roll over you and then afterward yeah

5723.679 --> 5728.719
you can still figure it out

5725.28 --> 5731.759999999999
as long as you're not triggered or

5728.719 --> 5731.76
anything in any way

5734.48 --> 5741.04
don't make it personal and that it is

5737.44 --> 5744.879999999999
about the ego because that's where

5741.04 --> 5746.8
defense mechanisms also come from

5744.88 --> 5748.32
figuring it out get an oversight it is

5746.8 --> 5750.4800000000005
to safeguard

5748.32 --> 5750.48
you

5751.76 --> 5755.04
and your position and your

5753.52 --> 5759.280000000001
representation

5755.04 --> 5760.96
and that's ego that's the root for that

5759.28 --> 5764.5599999999995
not necessarily a bad thing it's just

5760.96 --> 5764.56
how the mechanics work

5767.119 --> 5772.719
that's also why your representation is

5769.28 --> 5785.84
associated with ego it's you

5772.719 --> 5785.84
it's your identity

5798.4 --> 5805.28
reject nothing at face value and accept

5801.6 --> 5805.280000000001
anything blindly at face value

5805.679 --> 5813.84
those are good good objectives

5832.32 --> 5836.0
evaluate everything before you let your

5834.32 --> 5838.239
ego in yeah right before you

5836.0 --> 5841.04
tie it in with yourself for me i call

5838.239 --> 5843.36
that like testing the waters

5841.04 --> 5844.239
or basically trying to figure out the

5843.36 --> 5846.88
frequency

5844.239 --> 5847.36
of somebody like how do they do things

5846.88 --> 5849.76
what do

5847.36 --> 5851.759999999999
what probably drives them then crawford

5849.76 --> 5855.04
cross-referencing it with

5851.76 --> 5859.1990000000005
everyone else to see like where they're

5855.04 --> 5864.08
at before you start to make

5859.199 --> 5866.0
decisions on engaging like to associate

5864.08 --> 5867.679
first you figure out like where are they

5866.0 --> 5883.84
on the scales

5867.679 --> 5883.84
how are they

5894.84 --> 5901.4400000000005
so

5897.52 --> 5903.679
what hello mark smiley here

5901.44 --> 5911.839999999999
are you actually insulted i don't read

5903.679 --> 5911.84
all your comments

5912.48 --> 5917.04
even though i literally was quite honest

5915.679 --> 5919.679
and open about it

5917.04 --> 5919.679
towards you

5923.44 --> 5939.839999999999
i already told you like you shouldn't

5926.159 --> 5939.839999999999
expect me to read all that

5944.08 --> 5950.5599999999995
don't know why you would have to attain

5946.56 --> 5950.56
this specific type of attitude now

5951.44 --> 5967.839999999999
like not reading automatically makes you

5954.96 --> 5967.84
stupid or something

5992.84 --> 5995.84
what

5998.08 --> 6001.6
what are you talking about

6003.52 --> 6007.360000000001
one phone call from me

6007.52 --> 6011.280000000001
help stop what

6014.4 --> 6017.5199999999995
who am i supposed to be calling like

6016.719 --> 6023.84
what are you

6017.52 --> 6023.84
talking about man

6030.96 --> 6034.84
trust me every phone call that i've made

6033.28 --> 6038.639
like in the last

6034.84 --> 6041.6
year with anybody there was

6038.639 --> 6043.679
definitely agreement eventually that

6041.6 --> 6045.6
corona is [ __ ]

6043.679 --> 6047.52
like pretty much every conversation i

6045.6 --> 6050.96
had with people

6047.52 --> 6053.1990000000005
that i kind of knew ended up like that i

6050.96 --> 6053.199
did

6054.8 --> 6059.679
trying to explain what the [ __ ] are you

6057.119 --> 6061.5199999999995
blabbering about man

6059.679 --> 6063.119
are you like engaging in this weird

6061.52 --> 6065.119000000001
magical thinking

6063.119 --> 6067.759999999999
like i'm not going there again doesn't

6065.119 --> 6071.04
work like that

6067.76 --> 6072.400000000001
a phone call to somebody by me is not

6071.04 --> 6074.32
going to stop

6072.4 --> 6076.08
the implementation of the corona

6074.32 --> 6079.84
[ __ ]

6076.08 --> 6079.84
where are you getting this from

6085.76 --> 6093.84
like who do you think i am

6119.36 --> 6123.28
dude if there was some kind of phone

6120.96 --> 6127.04
call that i could make

6123.28 --> 6129.36
to make it stop yeah sure as long as

6127.04 --> 6130.32
it is not in the specific consequences

6129.36 --> 6133.36
that i would be

6130.32 --> 6135.5199999999995
dying as part of that yeah

6133.36 --> 6137.28
but i don't know any phone call that i

6135.52 --> 6140.320000000001
could make that can make the corona

6137.28 --> 6140.32
[ __ ] stop

6146.84 --> 6149.84
so

6152.96 --> 6159.679
oh the implant yeah yeah but

6156.4 --> 6159.679
what is your point man

6159.92 --> 6163.6
like people that are gonna take the

6161.36 --> 6167.199
vaccine are just gonna take the vaccine

6163.6 --> 6171.119000000001
and there's nothing you can do about it

6167.199 --> 6174.239
it's how it works it's just some people

6171.119 --> 6176.48
will just choose it no matter what

6174.239 --> 6177.599999999999
you know why they will some will end up

6176.48 --> 6180.159
choosing it

6177.6 --> 6181.360000000001
because other people like for example

6180.159 --> 6183.28
you will never

6181.36 --> 6185.119
let it go and will always be like please

6183.28 --> 6188.32
stop it and they'll do it

6185.119 --> 6190.159
just to try and nag you

6188.32 --> 6191.679
sound that does that sound crazy well

6190.159 --> 6194.96
guess what

6191.679 --> 6195.36
that's actually real people will just do

6194.96 --> 6198.88
it

6195.36 --> 6200.719
just because they're sick of listening

6198.88 --> 6202.96
to other people telling them that it's

6200.719 --> 6206.4
dangerous

6202.96 --> 6208.32
just like that or who knows what stupid

6206.4 --> 6208.96
reason to show off that they're not

6208.32 --> 6212.0
afraid

6208.96 --> 6218.159
whatever people are gonna take it and

6212.0 --> 6219.84
there's no stopping it

6218.159 --> 6222.32
mean that everybody's going to be forced

6219.84 --> 6233.84
to take it

6222.32 --> 6233.84
they can't do that

6234.1 --> 6237.229
[Music]

6246.639 --> 6251.04
my views have been sent in the wrong

6249.119 --> 6261.839999999999
direction

6251.04 --> 6261.84
what are you talking about

6282.48 --> 6286.718999999999
dude you are seriously sounding

6285.04 --> 6289.679
psychotic right now

6286.719 --> 6291.679
i can't figure out what the freaking

6289.679 --> 6294.0
point is you're even making

6291.679 --> 6294.8
i'm not going to read your freaking

6294.0 --> 6297.52
messages

6294.8 --> 6299.679
if there's something i need to know then

6297.52 --> 6303.679
you can just say it there

6299.679 --> 6304.4
and if you can't then it's not gonna be

6303.679 --> 6307.52
worth it

6304.4 --> 6307.5199999999995
reading for me anyway

6308.639 --> 6312.0
this is ridiculous

6312.4 --> 6317.839999999999
get a point yeah i'm gonna

6315.679 --> 6319.679

6331.04 --> 6334.719
the hell are you talking about my

6332.719 --> 6336.08

the [ __ ] are you blabbering about you're

6338.96 --> 6346.2390000000005

6369.28 --> 6373.119
because sometimes you say something

6371.04 --> 6374.8
that's halfway interesting

6373.119 --> 6376.239
if you're just going to be pushy like

6374.8 --> 6378.639
this no

6376.239 --> 6379.919999999999

6378.639 --> 6382.8
psychosis on me

6379.92 --> 6384.56
thank you very much smark smiler if that

6382.8 --> 6388.719

6384.56 --> 6392.400000000001
[ __ ] off go knack somebody else please

6405.679 --> 6415.84

6422.42 --> 6425.64
[Applause]

6426.84 --> 6431.679
ah

6428.159 --> 6433.28
right so any any comments i was very

6431.679 --> 6435.1990000000005
introspective today

6433.28 --> 6436.32
very very interesting i'm gonna listen

6435.199 --> 6440.638999999999
back and see how

6436.32 --> 6440.639
how cohesive it actually was what i said

6440.719 --> 6446.4
because i think and in ways like i've

6444.239 --> 6448.48
i always feel like i've been you know

6446.4 --> 6450.96
over my head a little

6448.48 --> 6453.119
i'll see i gotta watch my shows back

6450.96 --> 6454.4800000000005
anyway sometimes so i'll just watch this

6453.119 --> 6457.119
back see what i got to say

6454.48 --> 6459.199
see what i think about it i guess that a

6457.119 --> 6461.5199999999995
lot of you people are also kind of

6459.199 --> 6462.879999999999
in that process of like yeah what do i

6461.52 --> 6466.080000000001
think about this

6462.88 --> 6468.719
was it really good was it purposeful

6466.08 --> 6470.08
did i get a peek into a structure where

6468.719 --> 6473.119
i had not seen as

6470.08 --> 6473.84
clear before because that is kind of my

6473.119 --> 6477.599999999999
objective

6473.84 --> 6480.32
is to just show you a deeper

6477.6 --> 6482.84
part of the fractal so you can gain even

6480.32 --> 6485.92
further inside

6482.84 --> 6488.400000000001
deeper fractal of reality that's what

6485.92 --> 6488.4
i'm trying

6490.48 --> 6494.4
but yeah i'm going to round out the show

6492.88 --> 6497.1990000000005
so mark smelly

6494.4 --> 6500.159
yeah just going to have to sit it out

6497.199 --> 6500.159
for the rest of this show

6502.08 --> 6506.719
and don't get pushy again like that like

6507.199 --> 6514.08
i'm being patient enough because there

6510.0 --> 6516.56
is a history and you're not necessarily

6514.08 --> 6517.44
a negative person but i'm not gonna

6516.56 --> 6521.360000000001
tolerate you

6517.44 --> 6523.44
pushing your [ __ ] on me like that

6521.36 --> 6525.199
so please stop it and just continue

6523.44 --> 6527.199
doing what you used to do

6525.199 --> 6529.5199999999995
don't expect me to read everything you

6527.199 --> 6532.5599999999995
write and don't get cranky over it

6529.52 --> 6535.679
you want to write it you do that

6532.56 --> 6538.56
don't expect other people's to want to

6535.679 --> 6541.52
read it as much as you want to write it

6538.56 --> 6545.04
okay that's not how it works

6541.52 --> 6546.639
