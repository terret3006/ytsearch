especially that's yeah despite how it

87.56 --> 92.93
looks it's not as cold as it looks

bullet for one one Elisha Freeman Amanda

161.66 --> 163.87
young

176.65 --> 179.37
huh

179.879 --> 185.349
sorry I'm getting a bit distracting here

182.5 --> 190.42
over Mukul it seems like some words are

185.349 --> 192.73
getting getting taxed but I don't know

190.42 --> 197.22
why it's not because of words that I put

192.73 --> 197.22
in my list so that seems kind of weird

199.11 --> 214.89000000000001
let's see more colored right michael

206.709 --> 214.89000000000001
roark rakia life doesn't pop

216.12 --> 229.16
yeah good to see you all it's Monday so

223.91 --> 229.16
yeah there's some developments going

230.09 --> 239.61
first off everybody seems to be now

234.319 --> 242.03
going for D life like apparently Glo

239.61 --> 247.17000000000002
busters yesterday I think was on D live

242.03 --> 250.38
and lift the veil has gone fully to D

247.17 --> 252.54
live and I think Owen Benjamin has now

250.38 --> 255.269
fully translated to D life it's like

252.54 --> 257.28
almost like a countermove against what's

255.269 --> 257.959
going on and I'm considering doing it

257.28 --> 260.36999999999995
myself

257.959 --> 266.49
although I don't really know a lot about

260.37 --> 268.979
D life and how things work if I would do

266.49 --> 272.01
my show over there like is it even

268.979 --> 275.96999999999997
stored or recorded anywhere or is it

272.01 --> 278.96999999999997
just a live stream and that's it but I

275.97 --> 282.39000000000004
do have an account there initially just

278.97 --> 283.86
to be able to comment and there's

282.39 --> 286.89
already other people that have bumped

283.86 --> 291.41900000000004
into a lot from the flatterer seem a lot

286.89 --> 293.59999999999997
of barriers also so I think I could do

291.419 --> 293.59999999999997
it

298.62 --> 304.41
you can watch old streams right well I

302.16 --> 306.84000000000003
might just have to go for a tester and

304.41 --> 313.29
see how it works and if I think it's

306.84 --> 316.22999999999996
viable then indeed go there but I have

313.29 --> 320.97
to understand a little bit more because

316.23 --> 323.46000000000004
a over here I do kind of have the the

320.97 --> 325.56
income from Google a little and I don't

323.46 --> 328.95
know if I'd get anything out of that

325.56 --> 332.16
thing or I think because the whole lemon

328.95 --> 334.26
situation over there is based on their

332.16 --> 337.92
cryptocurrency but I don't really know

334.26 --> 340.26
what it's like their cryptocurrency what

337.92 --> 343.82
you can do with that or if it's only for

340.26 --> 343.82
interacting with a platform

355.37 --> 363.18
but anyway that's going on also already

360.919 --> 365.24
continuing downloading I don't know if

363.18 --> 367.319
I'll have now I probably won't have

365.24 --> 372.3
everything downloaded from the early

367.319 --> 374.72900000000004
bird show before the 10th so I hope they

372.3 --> 376.529
had not just outright cut me off

374.729 --> 379.349
although I don't see why they would at

376.529 --> 380.969
this point because I have no strikes I'm

379.349 --> 383.68899999999996
an advertisement friendly I didn't

380.969 --> 391.979
haven't got any kind of warning

383.689 --> 394.189
except for yet the was addy forget the

391.979 --> 394.18899999999996
name

396.43 --> 401.009
oh yeah the terms and conditions that's

398.77 --> 401.00899999999996
it

414.879 --> 420.58000000000004
well bit of venom I simply haven't ever

417.759 --> 423.309
tried anything on d life I kind of made

420.58 --> 424.779
an account there because I already heard

423.309 --> 427.689
a deal life a long time ago it was

424.779 --> 431.55
actually left a feel that was very early

427.689 --> 435.399
with trying on other streaming systems

431.55 --> 437.409
so that part of the reason I'm also

435.399 --> 442.449
interested in following him because he's

437.409 --> 445.659
just very widespread and he is also into

442.449 --> 447.42900000000003
streaming technology and yeah I've

445.659 --> 452.229
learned a lot from him even though I

447.429 --> 454.029
don't agree with a lot of it well with

452.229 --> 461.61899999999997
not every of his opinion so that's just

454.029 --> 465.969
say it like that but yeah I learned love

461.619 --> 468.09900000000005
there and I can try it out but no I have

465.969 --> 472.24
no experience with it whatsoever and I

468.099 --> 477.11899999999997
have a a platform II I've been using

472.24 --> 477.119
YouTube for for three years

498.66 --> 504.24
yeah open moku by the way I know that

500.85 --> 510.21000000000004
just watching it get you boxes of lemons

504.24 --> 513.15
and all that it's they they really made

510.21 --> 517.169
it into a game like thing to watch

513.15 --> 520.0799999999999
streams it's very basic game but because

517.169 --> 524.34
they woven that in yeah it keeps things

520.08 --> 528.38
rolling so it's very smart design

524.34 --> 531.39
platform an interactive platform but I

528.38 --> 534.9
don't know if any of that means anything

531.39 --> 537.15
its own Benjamin says it too is like for

534.9 --> 540.15
last few streams like yeah lemons love

537.15 --> 541.8
it I like the idea of a top score with

540.15 --> 544.14
the lemons but I don't know what they

541.8 --> 552.03
really do and that it really means

544.14 --> 555.0
anything oh well yeah my dear life

552.03 --> 560.15
channel name is just our win

555.0 --> 560.15
I let me check it out

571.46 --> 574.899
alright I'll post a link

578.35 --> 585.2900000000001
so yeah if you wanna pre subscribe fo

582.05 --> 587.4499999999999
I've already have 10 followers but yeah

585.29 --> 590.8399999999999
that's where it's probably gonna happen

587.45 --> 593.9000000000001
I have no idea how viable it's gonna be

590.84 --> 596.63
even if you know I'm hanging around in

593.9 --> 600.38
YouTube and being around a lot being

596.63 --> 602.72
consistent being the same over a long

600.38 --> 605.47
period does have a lot of advantages but

602.72 --> 608.57
I don't know really at this point if and

605.47 --> 611.27
now I'm kind of pooh-poohing on myself

608.57 --> 613.94
again but I don't know if with what I do

611.27 --> 616.91
if that's really super great for

613.94 --> 619.85
starting out you know a lot of people

616.91 --> 622.55
are a lot more interactive with their

619.85 --> 624.53
with their visuals and I have a nice

622.55 --> 629.39
background now thanks to Adam meek and

624.53 --> 635.17
also and my own basic skills with

629.39 --> 637.91
discord discord with the with OBS but

635.17 --> 640.91
yeah I don't know I don't know what it

637.91 --> 643.81
would be over just got more followers

640.91 --> 643.81
thank you bit of venom

647.2 --> 650.399
[Music]

657.44 --> 662.24
yeah yeah mate to tomé everybody knows

659.899 --> 665.0
that I always calm down after I get

662.24 --> 669.6800000000001
pissed off at somebody but that's just

665.0 --> 673.279
natural but I'm not gonna now be like oh

669.68 --> 675.079
I'm just gonna ignore it if somebody's

673.279 --> 677.6
misbehaving in a specific way especially

675.079 --> 680.9899999999999
when I point out a lot of things and

677.6 --> 683.0600000000001
information and context explanation and

680.99 --> 687.47
I then get ignored like what happened

683.06 --> 689.329
with conspiracy cats yesterday I really

687.47 --> 693.9490000000001
didn't like kicking him but there was

689.329 --> 696.079
just so rude what he did to keep on

693.949 --> 700.31
pushing his false equivalence despite me

696.079 --> 704.829
pointing everything out about it why

700.31 --> 704.829
would you be Block sorryto Cosentino

725.04 --> 734.069
well I think probably things are gonna

729.61 --> 734.069
happen on 10th but it's probably not

735.12 --> 738.12
goodbye

739.829 --> 750.939
you really know how to do it abandon

745.0 --> 755.29
ship abandon ship Globus because I will

750.939 --> 759.3389999999999
not allow you to insert your doublethink

755.29 --> 761.5889999999999
[ __ ] nonsense here not to that

759.339 --> 763.8100000000001
degree you know you can be fooled and

761.589 --> 765.4300000000001
then then try to work it out but if

763.81 --> 768.5189999999999
you're gonna double down after you've

765.43 --> 771.459
actually been a had the information to

768.519 --> 775.48
figure it out that's unacceptable and

771.459 --> 778.449
I'm not gonna be like Nathan just keep

775.48 --> 780.79
on reminding very loudly how you're

778.449 --> 782.649
idiots over and over again let you make

780.79 --> 784.48
the same mistake over and over again in

782.649 --> 789.25
my debt I'm not gonna go there because

784.48 --> 790.48
that's not my stick I like to leave that

789.25 --> 792.939
kind of thing to Nathan

790.48 --> 795.5500000000001
you go to Nathan specifically for that

792.939 --> 798.069
because you're all masochists oh Masek

795.55 --> 800.8
is stuck in your little little

798.069 --> 802.959
doublethink paradigm constantly so you

800.8 --> 805.149
need to have some steam Fanta from being

802.959 --> 808.449
imprisoned by your own mind I get that

805.149 --> 813.61
but I am NOT for that I'm here for

808.449 --> 818.189
people to to learn that's my primary

813.61 --> 826.319
objective with what I'm doing here with

818.189 --> 826.319
make successes but thank you mark holler

835.83 --> 839.36
thank you for spotting that

844.87 --> 849.62
right and and talking about mental cases

847.79 --> 853.0999999999999
okay this is what's the second thing

849.62 --> 857.12
that was gonna bring up I'm always kind

853.1 --> 858.95
of lucky that way because my show is one

857.12 --> 862.22
hour before the debates because you're

858.95 --> 865.82
gonna be oh you're gonna see it's gonna

862.22 --> 866.78
go nuts over there because yeah they

865.82 --> 871.3900000000001
found one

866.78 --> 874.3399999999999
they found one we got one we pulled one

871.39 --> 881.72
from out from other under a rock and we

874.34 --> 885.0500000000001
identified a major troll visually is it

881.72 --> 887.35
so Frodo that's not frozen now drunken

885.05 --> 887.3499999999999
wallet

899.55 --> 906.99
but yeah I got a funny picture for you

903.6 --> 906.99
let's see

909.72 --> 913.85
it's it's crazy Oh

915.89 --> 933.17
but it seems that somebody caught Jam

922.7 --> 936.6800000000001
panda got a picture of him man I don't

933.17 --> 938.6899999999999

936.68 --> 943.31
the master beach at have seen this and

938.69 --> 945.47

945.47 --> 949.089
Wow but

956.14 --> 961.5
[Music]

958.63 --> 965.08
yeah I almost feel a little bit guilty

961.5 --> 971.29
because yeah well the guy seems to have

965.08 --> 975.34
some physical burdens you could say but

971.29 --> 977.41
it is the yeah if you take that with a

975.34 --> 982.21
good person and you start to make fun of

977.41 --> 986.9499999999999
him then it's really really bad okay but

982.21 --> 989.6800000000001
this guy this guy is one of the most

986.95 --> 992.5600000000001
notorious baller trolls and liars and

989.68 --> 993.6899999999999
schemers out there and this is just

992.56 --> 1003.51
amazing

993.69 --> 1006.72
surreal okay so take a look at that it's

1003.51 --> 1010.1
funny because the the yeah the text is

1006.72 --> 1010.1
left out but but guess

1012.39 --> 1019.74
who that that slightly hunched back

1016.95 --> 1023.339
figure there is that that came walking

1019.74 --> 1028.79
into the globe light or in life unless

1023.339 --> 1028.79
yeses lie Chester Chester

1034.49 --> 1039.83

1036.35 --> 1042.35
there's better out there looks like a

1039.83 --> 1044.9299999999998
trip yeah but guess who it is it's so

1042.35 --> 1047.59

1044.93 --> 1047.5900000000001
for you guys

1052.8 --> 1057.69
yeah but I wanna guess I want to hear if

1055.41 --> 1059.75

1057.69 --> 1059.75
be

1063.92 --> 1070.809
I don't want a description come on

1074.57 --> 1087.1499999999999
Brenda ah no no but at least that's a

1080.76 --> 1087.93
guest so now it's in England keep that

1087.15 --> 1090.999
in mind

1087.93 --> 1090.999
[Music]

1096.94 --> 1101.679
okay okay enough with that yeah you want

1100.34 --> 1108.98
to know who that is

1101.679 --> 1113.3300000000002
it's Jam Panda yeah no it's not super

1108.98 --> 1119.09
schema it's Jam Panda really it's like

1113.33 --> 1121.76
surreal that is him it's like I didn't

1119.09 --> 1128.059
catch that in his voice but it is really

1121.76 --> 1133.76
him like what the hell this let me catch

1128.059 --> 1136.49
it catch another picture hold on yeah

1133.76 --> 1139.01
like seriously they went complete like

1136.49 --> 1141.919
Nathan and crew just went ballistic with

1139.01 --> 1147.649
that [ __ ] it's insane

1141.919 --> 1149.48
so I'll show you this sorry Nathan for

1147.649 --> 1155.529
stealing your thunder it's just too

1149.48 --> 1155.529
freakin funny I gotta share this so yeah

1161.289 --> 1166.45
yeah then Nathan went a little dark but

1167.2 --> 1171.769
yeah

1168.85 --> 1174.1689999999999
just think of what Jam Panda has been

1171.769 --> 1185.0
doing and how freaking creepy he really

1174.169 --> 1190.8090000000002
is it's it is kind of insane like the

1185.0 --> 1190.809
reality of it so yeah

1193.06 --> 1203.02
that's the world we live in but ya Jam

1202.42 --> 1206.68
Panda

1203.02 --> 1209.17
that's the guy I would have thought look

1206.68 --> 1212.97

1247.89 --> 1257.8200000000002
Benjamin Alert like I wonder if he will

1253.41 --> 1261.8400000000001
tackle it because it it would fit right

1257.82 --> 1264.87
down his lane to makes ya small had fun

1261.84 --> 1267.03
of this guy he is a notorious terrible

1264.87 --> 1269.9699999999998
globe or so I don't know if he do it

1267.03 --> 1272.49

1296.82 --> 1304.2
throwing stones here towards jam Panda

1301.2 --> 1309.69
oh really how am i doing that how am i

1304.2 --> 1313.32
doing that those pictures I shared I

1309.69 --> 1315.68
didn't make those just so you know they

1313.32 --> 1320.4299999999998
men Nathan made them imposed to them I

1315.68 --> 1324.1100000000001
called him deformed well Alan be have

1320.43 --> 1328.01
you taken a good look I think that is

1324.11 --> 1331.35
officially classified as deformed and I

1328.01 --> 1333.39
don't know how that works exactly it

1331.35 --> 1335.61
seems like a birth defect kind of thing

1333.39 --> 1339.3200000000002
I've seen other people that have a -

1335.61 --> 1339.32
there were very nice people so

1347.95 --> 1355.27
yeah sorry Ellen ba if you can are you a

1354.37 --> 1358.4499999999998
doctor

1355.27 --> 1362.74
well do you have eyes do I need to show

1358.45 --> 1365.41
the picture again Ellen be the the first

1362.74 --> 1367.36
one because apparently you didn't take a

1365.41 --> 1373.5700000000002
good look maybe you need to check up on

1367.36 --> 1377.1699999999998
your glasses or something because just

1373.57 --> 1381.52
look as to where is head is in relation

1377.17 --> 1382.63
to his shoulders okay and then look at

1381.52 --> 1387.06
the other people

1382.63 --> 1390.3100000000002
that's called deformity it's not evil

1387.06 --> 1392.1
and it's yeah it can be burdensome for

1390.31 --> 1394.84
somebody to have that kind of deformity

1392.1 --> 1397.9199999999998
definitely especially as they grow older

1394.84 --> 1403.3899999999999
I've heard about it before you know it's

1397.92 --> 1409.29
they're not yeah anyway it it's just

1403.39 --> 1409.2900000000002
like any other type of birthday factor

1410.71 --> 1417.13
although I don't see it a lot these days

1414.09 --> 1420.61
I wrote only really remember like I had

1417.13 --> 1423.8500000000001
a neighbor a woman that was slightly

1420.61 --> 1426.31
older that had it too didn't start out

1423.85 --> 1429.1899999999998
that way I think though I don't know how

1426.31 --> 1430.8999999999999
old Jim Panda is but I don't know if he

1429.19 --> 1433.3
started out this way or if it is the

1430.9 --> 1435.4
same kind of affliction and it like

1433.3 --> 1438.19
aggravates as you grow older I don't

1435.4 --> 1441.22
know exactly what the condition is but

1438.19 --> 1443.98
that is not normal okay that is not

1441.22 --> 1448.99
normal human stature he has back

1443.98 --> 1452.17
problems very obviously and I don't know

1448.99 --> 1454.42
just pointing that out in a neutral way

1452.17 --> 1456.75
in an informative way I don't see how

1454.42 --> 1456.75
that is

1460.59 --> 1466.9189999999999
how that is throwing stones I think that

1463.62 --> 1470.1789999999999
is throwing ice it's just taking a good

1466.919 --> 1470.179
look seeing what it is

1487.34 --> 1492.1789999999999
[Music]

1489.62 --> 1500.299
get the hell out Allenby you're

1492.179 --> 1500.299
disgusting seriously you are disgusting

1503.04 --> 1510.1499999999999
look the only thing that to me is funny

1507.09 --> 1515.04
about this revelation that who Champa is

1510.15 --> 1517.68
is not like oh he's all deformed and

1515.04 --> 1522.54
haha no that's absolutely I don't think

1517.68 --> 1526.5900000000001
that's funny at all it's just so super

1522.54 --> 1530.21
ironic in a way because Jam Panda is

1526.59 --> 1535.1999999999998
like such a nasty person even within his

1530.21 --> 1538.98
anonymity and how foolish is that it

1535.2 --> 1541.89
just seems crazy to me that he would

1538.98 --> 1545.31
allow him to go so far when he could be

1541.89 --> 1546.93
at any time uncovered and then smacked

1545.31 --> 1551.31
in the face with everything he's done

1546.93 --> 1556.14
he's gonna lose his his mercy as it were

1551.31 --> 1558.84
people yeah and I don't really

1556.14 --> 1561.3600000000001
sympathize now with him it's just I'm

1558.84 --> 1563.4599999999998
not gonna make fun of him but like my

1561.36 --> 1566.9299999999998
god what have you done man what have you

1563.46 --> 1566.93
done socially

1574.01 --> 1582.679
right he allowed himself to become a

1576.98 --> 1586.96
golem to become a chore with the looks

1582.679 --> 1592.25
house how insane is that it's like

1586.96 --> 1602.66
that's a very poor choice for a longer

1592.25 --> 1604.99
terrible like any sensible person knows

1602.66 --> 1610.299
that if you have some kind of deformity

1604.99 --> 1615.169
you need to be wise and charismatic and

1610.299 --> 1620.54
smart enable to compensate for that

1615.169 --> 1624.2900000000002
properly or you will yeah or things will

1620.54 --> 1627.8899999999999
go bad that's just a general fact and

1624.29 --> 1630.02
he's done doesn't yeah yeah why he's has

1627.89 --> 1636.3200000000002
the tongue at times but at the same time

1630.02 --> 1641.799
that grace not there like he spilled at

1636.32 --> 1641.799
all so many lies so many devious actions

1646.68 --> 1652.8300000000002
this is phase and posture art in the

1649.59 --> 1657.1699999999998
face of a severely disgruntled troll

1652.83 --> 1657.1699999999998
okay that is kind of funny yeah

1669.39 --> 1676.0490000000002
right pumpkin you remember it this is

1674.04 --> 1678.03
silly enough with golem if you're gonna

1676.049 --> 1679.44
take that literally in the movie you

1678.03 --> 1684.27
know golem was a disgusting creature

1679.44 --> 1687.03
really but also super tragic but people

1684.27 --> 1689.3899999999999
do feel sympathy for that despite his

1687.03 --> 1694.8899999999999
little is creepy

1689.39 --> 1697.92
devious nature because he also has some

1694.89 --> 1700.23
grace in his interaction and he is he

1697.92 --> 1703.429
and he goes through this inner struggle

1700.23 --> 1707.1200000000001
which is very interesting about that

1703.429 --> 1710.16
very famous scenes in Lord of the Rings

1707.12 --> 1713.6689999999999
so you can have some sympathy for it but

1710.16 --> 1719.22
yeah replace that character with Jam

1713.669 --> 1722.16
Panda like how he acts and tried to like

1719.22 --> 1724.32
melange that into the story somehow yeah

1722.16 --> 1726.99
everybody's gonna freaking hate that guy

1724.32 --> 1729.84
it's like what this guy is horrific

1726.99 --> 1732.0
he's so devious and he's constantly

1729.84 --> 1735.77
trying to get everybody screwed and

1732.0 --> 1735.77
feeling bad about themselves it's just

1736.07 --> 1743.21
this yeah my precious ball

1745.669 --> 1752.96
like a golem hanging around the ring

1748.14 --> 1756.679
bearer like açaí I want the ball back

1752.96 --> 1756.679
give me my ball back

1760.13 --> 1763.8690000000001
[Music]

1770.18 --> 1776.3200000000002
he's stooping I don't get it spare room

1773.45 --> 1776.32
using what you're saying

1779.33 --> 1783.3799999999999
he's probably stooping to do something

1782.36 --> 1786.05
and that's it

1783.38 --> 1789.98
freeze frame a picture of yourself in a

1786.05 --> 1795.1399999999999
for rent and see what you get well you

1789.98 --> 1802.7
get me remember me this guy this guy my

1795.14 --> 1804.5300000000002
features see regular guy not fat look

1802.7 --> 1806.27
pretty young for my age I have

1804.53 --> 1808.97
psychological issues and I've been

1806.27 --> 1810.98
extremely open about them and to get

1808.97 --> 1815.06
misunderstandings out of the way and to

1810.98 --> 1817.6100000000001
be open as much as I can which is kind

1815.06 --> 1820.28
of unusual for this age so yeah I'm I am

1817.61 --> 1824.84
NOT a regular person and not claiming

1820.28 --> 1827.54
that but you know I really do my best

1824.84 --> 1830.48
that's the difference and sometimes yeah

1827.54 --> 1833.96
I have painful issues that I deal with

1830.48 --> 1836.0
but instead of then just go whoo screw

1833.96 --> 1837.68
the world I'm gonna go full demon mode

1836.0 --> 1840.62
and just make people's lives and

1837.68 --> 1844.55
miserable in secret or something I'm

1840.62 --> 1848.6599999999999
gonna just try to get over it and doing

1844.55 --> 1851.06
that experimentally also by sharing some

1848.66 --> 1853.73
of it and try to just hold back so I

1851.06 --> 1856.1
don't cause real damage but yeah you're

1853.73 --> 1858.53
gonna see some emotional Arwen sometimes

1856.1 --> 1861.74
and that's really weird and I've already

1858.53 --> 1863.93
seen troll videos that are just abusing

1861.74 --> 1867.35
the [ __ ] out of that and it's just so

1863.93 --> 1870.38
revolting it's not even painful to me

1867.35 --> 1872.3899999999999
it's just that people would stoop to

1870.38 --> 1875.93
that level that they'd make and with

1872.39 --> 1881.89
their own faces doing that and we're

1875.93 --> 1885.8300000000002
like what the [ __ ] is why why would you

1881.89 --> 1889.6100000000001
put yourself out in that way out there

1885.83 --> 1892.4499999999998
it is so messed up I'm really sad for

1889.61 --> 1895.58
you like I I never meant to be an

1892.45 --> 1898.6100000000001
opportunity for you for you or anyone

1895.58 --> 1901.85
out there to stoop much lower than you

1898.61 --> 1903.53
already are I don't want that and though

1901.85 --> 1904.9099999999999
even though people may do that that's

1903.53 --> 1908.83
not gonna stop me from continuing

1904.91 --> 1908.8300000000002
because other people have actually

1908.89 --> 1913.39
progressed noticeably

1913.76 --> 1918.05
and L&B is not one of them

1930.86 --> 1941.8799999999999
like with us yeah it seems to be going

1935.31 --> 1945.02
around chocolate always calls me

1941.88 --> 1945.0200000000002
bizarro Legolas

1971.85 --> 1981.29
yeah well mark color whatever spare room

1975.48 --> 1985.85
music thinks it's not a look let me just

1981.29 --> 1994.11
try to come yeah let's see let me just

1985.85 --> 1999.09
show you it's a bit tough but look look

1994.11 --> 2001.52
at his shoulders his shoulders are

1999.09 --> 2004.22
actually higher than his hair now okay

2001.52 --> 2012.92
I'm gonna try to do this without getting

2004.22 --> 2016.49
naked but just yeah okay normal that is

2012.92 --> 2024.97
how far you go that what you see right

2016.49 --> 2024.97
there that is like this much lower that

2025.09 --> 2032.57
see so just to get that misunderstanding

2029.45 --> 2036.28
out of the way it's not eerily has that

2032.57 --> 2038.8999999999999
it's not just a crazy-looking cut

2036.28 --> 2040.76
definitely not and I think they I

2038.9 --> 2043.43
haven't watched the video to be honest

2040.76 --> 2047.35
but they had elaborate conversations his

2043.43 --> 2047.3500000000001
camp and his voice was recognized

2052.21 --> 2060.65
yep this is not a joke as in how open

2057.169 --> 2063.3199999999997
Benjamin would make fun about Joe Rogan

2060.65 --> 2067.1
and then just show photos of actual

2063.32 --> 2070.13
midgets you know it's not that yeah

2067.1 --> 2073.52
because that would be pretty low this is

2070.13 --> 2076.04
but it's really him that didn't just

2073.52 --> 2078.02
jump on it at the first word of it

2076.04 --> 2080.23
we're not ballers we're not that

2078.02 --> 2080.23
desperate

2082.5 --> 2085.53
[Music]

2087.63 --> 2090.7490000000003
[Music]

2099.7 --> 2114.609
yeah anyway this God people put out

2112.22 --> 2114.609
there

2118.97 --> 2129.79
and it's dark yes oh it's a dark

2144.97 --> 2151.6589999999997
[Music]

2156.02 --> 2163.83
yeah the Tom Parker like look this is

2160.52 --> 2165.9
yeah I could just bring out more stuff

2163.83 --> 2170.67
out of my sleeve and start talking about

2165.9 --> 2172.53
the looping model or straw Manning

2170.67 --> 2176.85
whatever there's all kinds of thing we

2172.53 --> 2179.28
can talk about these were just the the

2176.85 --> 2182.36
object or the subjects that were waiting

2179.28 --> 2182.36
in line that's it

2201.93 --> 2209.06
Oh AGM that's the thing what do you

2206.37 --> 2213.18
think we got the photographs and footage

2209.06 --> 2215.34
the globe light or team did meet him in

2213.18 --> 2218.24
person and did get into a conversation

2215.34 --> 2218.2400000000002
with him

2232.92 --> 2236.09
[Music]

2248.43 --> 2251.43
right

2258.03 --> 2261.03
right

2264.17 --> 2267.36
[Music]

2278.119 --> 2286.7400000000002
YUM yeah the Mandela effect like half of

2284.76 --> 2289.1400000000003
deal oh thank you drunken bullet for one

2286.74 --> 2296.5499999999997
one for the two Australian dollar super

2289.14 --> 2299.4
chat donation thank you very much and

2296.55 --> 2306.8390000000004
yes the Illuminati cousin is very tasty

2299.4 --> 2310.92
but Mandela effect yeah Nathan from

2306.839 --> 2314.16
lifter Phil was digging into that quite

2310.92 --> 2319.589
a lot and I saw new things that were

2314.16 --> 2321.589
relatively shocking to me mostly that

2319.589 --> 2325.29
things that seemed to have completely

2321.589 --> 2327.15
disappeared all entirely and what the

2325.29 --> 2329.54
two things stood out there was a lot

2327.15 --> 2333.7200000000003
shared yet the typical word changes but

2329.54 --> 2337.2
he tried to really push the edge push to

2333.72 --> 2338.5789999999997
the the really heavy things and there

2337.2 --> 2342.24
apparently are some things out there

2338.579 --> 2351.119
that even I remember that are just so

2342.24 --> 2353.5989999999997
far one of the things and I've heard

2351.119 --> 2354.78
about it before but the result is just

2353.599 --> 2359.309
weird

2354.78 --> 2363.2900000000004
like apparently in the Bible had the

2359.309 --> 2366.5690000000004
what is it the King James Bible had

2363.29 --> 2368.49
wineskins changed the wine bottles and

2366.569 --> 2372.45
there's well there was another saying

2368.49 --> 2374.3089999999997
with it and it kind of made sense and

2372.45 --> 2377.04
eventually we learned a lot like yeah

2374.309 --> 2380.01
bottles can't blow up but wine skins

2377.04 --> 2383.339
also it's like a side effect of the

2380.01 --> 2385.829
remnants and yeast laughs it can explode

2383.339 --> 2388.0789999999997
so that was kind of the content of what

2385.829 --> 2391.02
was altered but what was so weird is

2388.079 --> 2398.579
that every time you would google search

2391.02 --> 2403.13
it search it on wine skins don't put new

2398.579 --> 2406.98
wine in old wine skins there was a

2403.13 --> 2410.0
Wikipedia entry for that specifically

2406.98 --> 2413.15
even with a a picture a

2410.0 --> 2417.44
a painting of a person carrying a large

2413.15 --> 2419.51
wine sack thing it was there but then it

2417.44 --> 2422.2400000000002
was like yeah it's from this and that

2419.51 --> 2425.349
and then here's the example but in all

2422.24 --> 2428.75
the examples it only talked about

2425.349 --> 2431.119
putting new wine in old wine bottles and

2428.75 --> 2435.38
how that was explained it was totally

2431.119 --> 2438.59
sir it was like this the engine still

2435.38 --> 2441.38
had the old remnant in it and it maybe

2438.59 --> 2443.57
left it there sort of in order for

2441.38 --> 2450.65
people to bump in it was so surreal that

2443.57 --> 2455.98
it's still there so it's still there but

2450.65 --> 2458.78
it seems to have yeah all been replaced

2455.98 --> 2461.75
so it feels more like it's from the

2458.78 --> 2464.27
digital side like I get the feeling

2461.75 --> 2466.7
sometimes from the whole well there's

2464.27 --> 2468.52
more than just this going on but I think

2466.7 --> 2471.14
that sometimes there is it like a

2468.52 --> 2477.2
Mandela effect goes hand in hand with

2471.14 --> 2481.58
like a covert pretty intense censorship

2477.2 --> 2483.74
system that may yeah accompanied with

2481.58 --> 2484.21
other effects because here's a here you

2483.74 --> 2489.16
go

2484.21 --> 2493.2200000000003
apparently there's this cartoon simbad

2489.16 --> 2494.75
about I technically don't even remember

2493.22 --> 2499.1899999999996
what it's about again except for the

2494.75 --> 2501.17
stories in that the sea man however you

2499.19 --> 2503.06
call it that's how it's roughly

2501.17 --> 2505.13
translated from Dutch how I know it and

2503.06 --> 2507.619
I remember seeing that being super

2505.13 --> 2509.75
intensely inspired and getting into

2507.619 --> 2511.69
arguments with my parents over it and

2509.75 --> 2514.25
apparently a lot of people had that

2511.69 --> 2516.89
remember that the caller that called

2514.25 --> 2519.29
Lifta Phil remember this scribe and I

2516.89 --> 2522.95
remember it too I remember seeing it

2519.29 --> 2526.54
well guess what that cartoon doesn't

2522.95 --> 2526.54
exist and never has

2531.37 --> 2540.2799999999997
and I remember seeing it and having

2535.45 --> 2542.73
issues about it with my parents how

2540.28 --> 2542.73
weird is that

2553.55 --> 2566.4300000000003
yeah yeah those kind of things freaked

2557.64 --> 2570.72
me out the most it seems almost like I'm

2566.43 --> 2573.69
getting the feeling like some people in

2570.72 --> 2575.6099999999997
history have written replaced or

2573.69 --> 2582.09
switched out with other individuals

2575.61 --> 2583.7400000000002
somehow because some people that I see

2582.09 --> 2589.76
just don't look like the same person

2583.74 --> 2589.7599999999998
anymore in movies also

2600.75 --> 2607.65
yeah bread and cook but the thing is

2604.56 --> 2609.69
with small alterations like things are

2607.65 --> 2612.84
slightly different in the part in a in a

2609.69 --> 2616.4
movie or whatever or in the name of a

2612.84 --> 2619.619
product that is kind of annoying and

2616.4 --> 2623.55
confusing but that's entirely different

2619.619 --> 2627.33
from literally something never having

2623.55 --> 2630.8100000000004
existed despite people having extensive

2627.33 --> 2639.5099999999998
memories of it now there is something

2630.81 --> 2641.52
pretty tough right you can just

2639.51 --> 2645.71
psychological psychologically

2641.52 --> 2649.23
psychologically is in a way it's no way

2645.71 --> 2653.099
how can this thing not exist anymore

2649.23 --> 2661.05
despite people having seen it and should

2653.099 --> 2663.96
be having copies and all that yeah I

2661.05 --> 2668.46
just shared one there there used to be a

2663.96 --> 2674.88
cartoon movie called Sinbad it's based

2668.46 --> 2678.45
on I think like and I think it's boarded

2674.88 --> 2682.26
two Arabian tales but it's more about

2678.45 --> 2688.16
Seafarer like it's a long time ago but I

2682.26 --> 2691.32
know that exists as a story in yeah and

2688.16 --> 2694.94
there was a cartoon movie of it and it

2691.32 --> 2694.94
just it's never existed

2701.33 --> 2707.2999999999997
well Murphy it was supposed to be for

2704.33 --> 2710.09
kids but apparently it was too rough and

2707.3 --> 2713.03
a lot of parents had issues over it with

2710.09 --> 2715.8700000000003
their kids and I remember that for

2713.03 --> 2715.8700000000003
myself as well

2750.39 --> 2756.7999999999997
yeah

2753.04 --> 2760.55
and weirdly enough by the way also more

2756.8 --> 2764.03
synchronicity in my personal life after

2760.55 --> 2767.09
I watch that that D live stream from

2764.03 --> 2770.7200000000003
left avail about about the Mandela

2767.09 --> 2772.88
effect and these things appearing I

2770.72 --> 2776.87
didn't even talk about it but I just

2772.88 --> 2778.9100000000003
noticed like wait that actress that

2776.87 --> 2782.17
supposedly had the bracers in the James

2778.91 --> 2784.04
Bond movie that then was the joke

2782.17 --> 2786.62
remember about Oh

2784.04 --> 2789.11
once the guy's miles with his jaw teeth

2786.62 --> 2790.8199999999997
metal thingy and then she would smile

2789.11 --> 2792.38
and half the braces and then suddenly

2790.82 --> 2794.84
they have a bond because they are kind

2792.38 --> 2798.59
of in the same package well that changed

2794.84 --> 2801.4100000000003
everybody knows that but you know what I

2798.59 --> 2806.02
looked at it again as it was being

2801.41 --> 2811.67
streamed and I just thought that actress

2806.02 --> 2814.85
that's not the same actress that used to

2811.67 --> 2817.4300000000003
be somebody else this looks kind of

2814.85 --> 2819.5899999999997
alike but it's different it's still did

2817.43 --> 2822.04
it's not exactly the same looking

2819.59 --> 2822.04
actress

2829.29 --> 2834.08
has anybody else had that feeling

2834.15 --> 2837.239
[Music]

2872.52 --> 2877.16
when they'll Brennan cook Mandela never

2874.77 --> 2885.41
died in prison that was always a PSYOP

2877.16 --> 2890.73
from the start there was just leftist

2885.41 --> 2895.6189999999997
mind confusion up because I remember

2890.73 --> 2898.619
when that was said and then late days

2895.619 --> 2901.26
later it just continued being in the

2898.619 --> 2903.48
news and what yeah like he wasn't it so

2901.26 --> 2911.61
and then wasn't mention again it was

2903.48 --> 2914.369
very weird yeah it was everywhere and

2911.61 --> 2915.6600000000003
then suddenly it never happened because

2914.369 --> 2919.29
it never happened

2915.66 --> 2922.5499999999997
probably never has ever it was probably

2919.29 --> 2922.55
a media up that thing

2947.21 --> 2950.21
hmm

2952.31 --> 2963.16
and yeah mark colored I think that's the

2955.25 --> 2963.16
one let me look it up myself

2975.91 --> 2980.299
wait

2977.67 --> 2980.299
No

2983.02 --> 2994.6
you know that's not the one that's anime

2985.119 --> 2999.7200000000003
I think it was just Sinbad but it was

2994.6 --> 2999.72
the same story thing

3015.28 --> 3018.15
anyway

3035.299 --> 3041.64
the Mandela effect movie worker what

3039.21 --> 3044.299
what the Mandela effect movie what are

3041.64 --> 3044.299
you talking about

3067.33 --> 3070.11
hmm

3071.48 --> 3080.88
right well mark colored I I don't

3077.119 --> 3089.78
recognize what I'm getting images off

3080.88 --> 3095.609
when I look it up there's just this old

3089.78 --> 3099.77
style yeah anime version and there's

3095.609 --> 3099.77
just more modern modern stuff

3111.94 --> 3119.51
knowing this apparently this sexy comic

3115.13 --> 3127.69
about it as well now that I'm scrolling

3119.51 --> 3127.69
through that yeah whatever but yeah I I

3128.5 --> 3135.14
don't know I remember that there was a

3132.83 --> 3136.79
controversial cartoon that I wanted to

3135.14 --> 3137.48
watch it that I think I saw something

3136.79 --> 3144.68
about it

3137.48 --> 3145.16
and that there was a lot of hassle movie

3144.68 --> 3147.7
trailer

3145.16 --> 3147.7
okay

3152.38 --> 3155.51
[Music]

3166.23 --> 3168.92
huh

3171.599 --> 3184.2290000000003
well okay that's so it is a sci-fi movie

3179.989 --> 3188.479
or thriller okay

3184.229 --> 3192.3799999999997
I've wheels up yeah

3188.479 --> 3192.3799999999997
when supposed to come up

3198.109 --> 3203.43
anyway I didn't know that existed

3200.75 --> 3206.059
although I do recognize pictures having

3203.43 --> 3206.0589999999997
seen that before

3213.839 --> 3217.099
why cartoon

3217.74 --> 3229.18
are you sure

3220.73 --> 3229.18
say no fake elta Popeye cartoon

3230.94 --> 3234.15
[Music]

3237.67 --> 3248.21
no because it's still there so that

3246.74 --> 3252.1699999999996
doesn't make a lot of sense that you

3248.21 --> 3257.2
would because you can just look it up

3252.17 --> 3257.2000000000003
it's out there so no that's not the one

3353.65 --> 3356.65
hmm

3373.97 --> 3379.91
yeah well Brandon could look this whole

3377.06 --> 3381.77
thing about a cartoon that apparently

3379.91 --> 3384.5789999999997
isn't there anymore it's very tough to

3381.77 --> 3386.869
really figure out what that is because

3384.579 --> 3389.15
yeah there's nothing about it anymore

3386.869 --> 3392.06
like it literally never existed

3389.15 --> 3397.13
supposedly so yeah but there's lots of

3392.06 --> 3401.39
other cartoons and probably movies of

3397.13 --> 3410.2000000000003
the same story type but from other

3401.39 --> 3410.2
regions with other styles and it's yeah

3414.819 --> 3423.829
now I find the the search results that

3419.93 --> 3427.91
happen and in Wikipedia concerning alt

3423.829 --> 3430.79
wine into wine skins and how it just in

3427.91 --> 3433.839
your face replaces it with alt wine in

3430.79 --> 3437.06
wine or new wine in old wine bottles I

3433.839 --> 3441.2799999999997
think that is much more bizarre because

3437.06 --> 3441.2799999999997
like literally it's just there

3460.53 --> 3475.01
yeah hmm anyway why lemme just need to

3469.77 --> 3477.72
go um I'm gonna round out the show yeah
