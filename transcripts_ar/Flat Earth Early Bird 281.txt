the weather report and yeah that it

79.649 --> 84.99
seems like there's a nice weather front

81.539 --> 88.2
over here although I think in the in

84.99 --> 90.24
England it's not so good probably so

88.2 --> 91.83
we're kind of lucky here in the

90.24 --> 93.479
Netherlands and the West Germany and

91.83 --> 98.75

hang out about that nonsense right the

207.3 --> 213.12
hand is completely out of control

209.39 --> 220.82999999999998
he's contracted the chemo virus and he's

213.12 --> 223.65
also adapted PT a [ __ ] obsession it's

220.83 --> 227.10000000000002
just a nightmare and he went totally out

223.65 --> 230.19
of control and chat even again attacking

227.1 --> 232.85
chocolates sayin it just this guy is

230.19 --> 232.85
nuts

234.53 --> 243.33
no I'm pretty sure there are no trainees

238.26 --> 248.67
on the scene and if there are they will

243.33 --> 251.959
be self admitted I think it's a

248.67 --> 251.95899999999997
ridiculous obsession

253.9 --> 263.47
like who cares anyway you know them by

260.959 --> 265.88
their behavior what does it matter

263.47 --> 269.24
people have done in their private lives

265.88 --> 272.36
I don't get it

269.24 --> 274.37
just you know yeah if you're if you

272.36 --> 276.16900000000004
wanna if you fall in love with somebody

274.37 --> 279.5
and you feel like oh yeah we're gonna

276.169 --> 282.2
have a relationship and then turns out

279.5 --> 286.85
that they're not a natural born as it

282.2 --> 290.24
were yeah that really sucks but is that

286.85 --> 294.08000000000004
what this is all about no flat earth is

290.24 --> 298.34000000000003
just about the information it's it's

294.08 --> 301.7
just it really is completely unnecessary

298.34 --> 304.15999999999997
it is superfluous it is a ridiculous

301.7 --> 313.82
obsession that some people have

304.16 --> 318.77000000000004
introduced it's just not off this field

313.82 --> 321.169
you know you look yeah there there's

318.77 --> 324.10999999999996
political stuff concerning it going on

321.169 --> 329.18
the creepy school indoctrination and all

324.11 --> 332.33000000000004
that but that has just no direct

329.18 --> 336.53000000000003
correlation whatsoever to anything Flat

332.33 --> 340.46
Earth related so it just it's a troll

336.53 --> 343.90999999999997
it's a troll plant it's a bad seed

340.46 --> 347.87
that's been injected and people some

343.91 --> 350.03000000000003
people unfortunately have taken it and

347.87 --> 354.16
it's just spreading like a weed it's it

350.03 --> 354.15999999999997
has no use no use whatsoever

357.64 --> 360.779
[Music]

368.34 --> 378.11999999999995
well if Earth Phaedra I'm pretty sure

372.33 --> 385.25
she has several kids has had them for a

378.12 --> 385.25
long time and it's just why

389.91 --> 395.79
why are you sickly obsessed over this

393.72 --> 397.71000000000004
[ __ ] the only reason I can really think

395.79 --> 401.37
of is that you've watched too much porn

397.71 --> 403.91999999999996
and constantly got like Auto suggested

401.37 --> 406.71
to [ __ ] [ __ ] because that happens when

403.92 --> 409.8
you keep on digging in that crap so

406.71 --> 413.84999999999997
maybe it just it it keeps on happening

409.8 --> 416.43
in other videos now as well as just a

413.85 --> 420.48
cognitive jump it's an obsession it's

416.43 --> 423.0
sick it doesn't make sense that you are

420.48 --> 426.96000000000004
even trying to figure that out about

423.0 --> 429.38
somebody it's sick behavior that's what

426.96 --> 429.38
I'm saying

433.35 --> 436.6
[Music]

450.21 --> 457.50899999999996
no no I definitely got not gonna go

453.31 --> 460.419
there look I adamantly resist all of

457.509 --> 462.219
these notions and if you think it's

460.419 --> 463.84
funny to start trolling with me then

462.219 --> 466.27
it's just gonna be another banning

463.84 --> 470.67999999999995
session because I don't want to talk

466.27 --> 473.279
about that [ __ ] okay so I'm gonna

470.68 --> 473.279
move on

473.46 --> 483.27
see ya I've been doing yesterday

484.98 --> 491.79
you know I went to bed pretty early I

487.2 --> 493.89
had a very weird experience and yeah

491.79 --> 496.22
chocolate was there so he witnessed it

493.89 --> 500.15999999999997
sort of it was right after the last

496.22 --> 502.59000000000003
aftershow of the debates it was really

500.16 --> 505.14000000000004
freaky for me

502.59 --> 507.84
yeah chocolate and me were pretty much

505.14 --> 509.76
the only one left and we tend to do that

507.84 --> 511.28999999999996
then talk afterwards a little bit about

509.76 --> 513.45
what happened and everything you know

511.29 --> 517.83
chocolate Amir really good friends I

513.45 --> 520.1690000000001
feel and I was drinking beers basically

517.83 --> 523.4100000000001
at the end thought like okay it's past

520.169 --> 526.02
5:00 now why not I have him and then

523.41 --> 529.53
suddenly one of these beers was really

526.02 --> 533.76
freaky it just I don't know it smelled

529.53 --> 536.01
off but I yeah I was already pretty

533.76 --> 537.51
exhausted and I thought oh [ __ ] I hope

536.01 --> 539.28
I'm not don't have a cold or something

537.51 --> 542.49
that I'm smelling this right doesn't

539.28 --> 545.52
make any sense and when I tasted it it's

542.49 --> 547.23
just like huh no it can't really taste

545.52 --> 550.5
it but there is just this weird smell

547.23 --> 555.15
going on I don't know it didn't feel it

550.5 --> 558.99
felt a bit off but I iced it I don't

555.15 --> 560.9399999999999
know like very little of it and then I

558.99 --> 564.12
thought not this is just not normal

560.94 --> 568.2600000000001
I got another beer smelled it thought

564.12 --> 570.27
like know that it's it is that beer so I

568.26 --> 575.48
poured it out in a glass and that was

570.27 --> 579.18
just this weird there were these white

575.48 --> 581.49
things floating in it I don't know what

579.18 --> 582.9
the hell that was but I don't think it

581.49 --> 585.36
was some kind of fungus but it was

582.9 --> 587.1
definitely polluted with something and I

585.36 --> 591.3000000000001
thought oh god I hope that's not some

587.1 --> 594.09
kind of ground-up dead mouse or

591.3 --> 598.3499999999999
something because yeah it did smell like

594.09 --> 600.9300000000001
rotten eggs but anyway I endured that I

598.35 --> 603.0600000000001
didn't like go and puke that out I felt

600.93 --> 606.12
like it screw that I'm just I'll just

603.06 --> 609.18
dilute it with more beers and take a my

606.12 --> 611.03
cozy axe just to be safe because that

609.18 --> 612.39
also kind of works against well

611.03 --> 615.6
potential pair

612.39 --> 618.24
that's whatever but I just had so little

615.6 --> 621.0600000000001
of it and I thought no I am healthy I am

618.24 --> 623.64
strong I can take a little of that kind

621.06 --> 627.17
of crap it's you know basically what you

623.64 --> 630.87
breathe in is also dead

627.17 --> 635.16
[ __ ] you know when there's dust outside

630.87 --> 636.78
that's not just sent it ya realize it so

635.16 --> 639.87
I would just thought no this is of my

636.78 --> 642.36
mind I'm not gonna let my mind make me

639.87 --> 644.99
sick because I believe that I oh my god

642.36 --> 647.76
poison no it couldn't have been that bad

644.99 --> 651.15
but it was a disgusting idea but I got

647.76 --> 654.18
over it it was kind of shaky from it but

651.15 --> 655.98
it was purely spiritual I didn't really

654.18 --> 657.7199999999999
feel sick this morning I didn't really

655.98 --> 661.29
feel sick and I think that I just like

657.72 --> 664.0400000000001
no but it was a weird experience I had

661.29 --> 667.02
so many of these beers and suddenly just

664.04 --> 669.41
what the hell was that how did that

667.02 --> 669.41
happen

680.059 --> 687.42
so yeah that happened that was kind of

682.85 --> 689.639
strange but yeah I guess from now on I

687.42 --> 696.149
will be pouring out my beers and Nicola

689.639 --> 697.919
has weirdly enough I I've always been

696.149 --> 700.47
doing that and it's just in the last

697.919 --> 702.059
month that I stopped it and just

700.47 --> 709.35
drinking it from the bottle because it

702.059 --> 711.179
tends to stay cold longer maybe I knew

709.35 --> 713.0690000000001
that instinctively there could be bad

711.179 --> 715.35
beers behind it and now that I didn't do

713.069 --> 717.66
it I got confronted with it but I've

715.35 --> 723.179
never poured any anything like that

717.66 --> 725.279
before so anyway let's move on I did

723.179 --> 728.73
report it to the store and they just

725.279 --> 738.239
gave me a new one so that was kind of

728.73 --> 739.589
nice Wow by the way it pretty I haven't

738.239 --> 742.11
really said a lot about it although

739.589 --> 745.379
everyone everybody has been able to keep

742.11 --> 749.22
track of it but I have gained quite a

745.379 --> 752.669
few subscribers in the last month at

749.22 --> 754.86
least 30 or 40 so yeah I should mention

752.669 --> 755.899
that more often that there will be new

754.86 --> 758.429
people

755.899 --> 761.189
now following the Flat Earth

758.429 --> 764.879
early-bird show my channel and yeah

761.189 --> 768.8389999999999
thank you for subscribing I hope I hope

764.879 --> 771.689
I will entertain and teach and if you

768.839 --> 774.72
have any questions yeah don't worry

771.689 --> 777.509
about that the weirdos is some people

774.72 --> 781.499
get pretty vivid and everything strong

777.509 --> 784.289
language in hmm in chat but always

781.499 --> 789.299
you're always welcome to ask a question

784.289 --> 791.61
even if it seems kind of dumb because if

789.299 --> 794.459
you're new you're new and I won't hold

791.61 --> 796.649
anything noobish against you you know

794.459 --> 799.3499999999999
I'll help you I'll help you get you on

796.649 --> 800.97
on your way if yeah you know it can be

799.35 --> 803.16
kind of difficult to start asking

800.97 --> 807.3190000000001
questions about these things that seem a

803.16 --> 807.319
bit scary like Flat Earth

808.17 --> 814.11
so yeah thanks every new subscriber that

811.8 --> 815.67
has subscribed and kept track made sure

814.11 --> 817.74
they kept subscribed because YouTube

815.67 --> 820.3499999999999
does screw with the subscribers and the

817.74 --> 824.28
Bell notifications and my freaking

820.35 --> 826.71
autoplay keeps on switching back it kid

824.28 --> 830.3399999999999
it happens especially when there's some

826.71 --> 832.95
freaking annoying space propaganda

830.34 --> 835.1700000000001
[ __ ] video in the in the role it

832.95 --> 842.0300000000001
just puts it there and and turns on opto

835.17 --> 844.29
play I hate it when they do that but

842.03 --> 846.39
yeah anyway that's just me

844.29 --> 848.37
maybe you enjoy those videos I really

846.39 --> 850.3199999999999
don't and they keep on telling YouTube

848.37 --> 857.13
I'm not interested but it keeps on doing

850.32 --> 859.0200000000001
it because YouTube is a jerk anyway if

857.13 --> 863.75
you're new here and you have questions

859.02 --> 863.75
feel free to ask don't be afraid

874.93 --> 879.189
so the feet toque asked what brand of

877.54 --> 882.04
beer it's the beer that I always take

879.189 --> 884.8
and in this case I'm not really gonna

882.04 --> 887.3499999999999
mention it because I am very satisfied

884.8 --> 889.18
about their overall beer quality this

887.35 --> 892.2090000000001
really was the first exception that I've

889.18 --> 894.79
ever seen must be some kind of weird

892.209 --> 898.2399999999999
fluke during exchanging a batch process

894.79 --> 901.149
or cleaning or whatever and you know I'm

898.24 --> 905.319
very glad with their brand because they

901.149 --> 907.449
have pretty cheap organic beer and I'm

905.319 --> 911.11
happy with that because I don't have a

907.449 --> 913.0889999999999
lot of money for that for other brands

911.11 --> 915.16
of beer that are all more expensive and

913.089 --> 921.399
I still think it's a good it's a good

915.16 --> 924.16
brand sorta like white claw I guess what

921.399 --> 927.399
was for what white claw was her own

924.16 --> 930.04
Benjamin but it's a Dutch brand it's

927.399 --> 935.98
Dutch made organic beer they also have

930.04 --> 940.4699999999999
non organic beer by the way but I

935.98 --> 940.47
definitely take the organic versions

940.829 --> 947.439
yeah and by the way I'm not like a day

944.11 --> 951.6990000000001
through drinker I have as I said before

947.439 --> 956.199
for beers you usually usually at minimum

951.699 --> 961.329
four that's the best for me I don't need

956.199 --> 964.24
more and then I have just one to two to

961.329 --> 967.2399999999999
three hours of just a fun moment and

964.24 --> 970.36
then it kind of wears off and then I get

967.24 --> 975.339
a bit sleepy and go to bed works great

970.36 --> 977.139
for me I don't like drinking all day

975.339 --> 981.73
through especially when it's still very

977.139 --> 984.309
sunny it just I don't know I've only had

981.73 --> 988.5690000000001
when it's really hot and I drinks

984.309 --> 991.509
alcohol I just have bad experiences from

988.569 --> 994.209
that you get like in this weird fever

991.509 --> 995.92
state when there's a lot of hot Sun and

994.209 --> 998.2299999999999
you have alcohol in your system I do at

995.92 --> 1003.92
least I don't like it I preferred my

998.23 --> 1003.9200000000001
beers in the evenings or at night

1007.31 --> 1012.39
can also be great like in a hot summer's

1010.35 --> 1014.61
day in the evening when it's when the

1012.39 --> 1018.54
sun's not on you and there's this nice

1014.61 --> 1029.699
breeze that's those are the best anyway

1018.54 --> 1034.53
oh dear pumpkin you do well I do admit

1029.699 --> 1036.8100000000002
that I do kind of smoke all day but not

1034.53 --> 1038.91
cut I don't I'm not a chain smoker I

1036.81 --> 1039.3899999999999
couldn't handle that that's not healthy

1038.91 --> 1043.23
for me

1039.39 --> 1049.65
but no alcohol definitely not all day

1043.23 --> 1051.75
it's very bad and yeah it just comes in

1049.65 --> 1053.64
waves just times when if you're like

1051.75 --> 1055.35
yeah I want to get a beer and then it

1053.64 --> 1058.0500000000002
keeps on happening and then after a

1055.35 --> 1060.09
while I'm like done with it I'm like no

1058.05 --> 1063.03
no no I need to get off the beers it

1060.09 --> 1066.6899999999998
feels bad and it's not fun anymore

1063.03 --> 1068.57
and then I just stop and as for the

1066.69 --> 1074.3700000000001
smoking yeah that's a little different

1068.57 --> 1076.86
sometimes I need to like cut down and I

1074.37 --> 1079.1699999999998
have cut down in the last two weeks I've

1076.86 --> 1081.9289999999999
cut down significantly and that a really

1079.17 --> 1085.53
I feel that it helped my body recover a

1081.929 --> 1087.48
lot I needed that so I'm gonna try to

1085.53 --> 1089.49
keep it down because I have been

1087.48 --> 1091.02
increasingly smoking more and more and

1089.49 --> 1092.58
more it just that just happens

1091.02 --> 1095.58
especially great weather when you feel

1092.58 --> 1098.82
great you just keep on going and take a

1095.58 --> 1101.6399999999999
little more get used to it so I just had

1098.82 --> 1106.25
to stop that it's terrible terrible

1101.64 --> 1109.25
financially and it's just not healthy so

1106.25 --> 1109.25
yeah

1111.09 --> 1115.99
it is mostly because of the finance

1113.8 --> 1118.78
financial consequences that you could

1115.99 --> 1120.07
consider it a direct problem and that

1118.78 --> 1126.58
they will keep that in mind it's not

1120.07 --> 1128.86
it's not like I'm you know I'd have to

1126.58 --> 1131.47
admit that to myself there are problems

1128.86 --> 1133.84
that are coming forth from that process

1131.47 --> 1137.29
even though I do find joy in it and it

1133.84 --> 1140.86
does help me focus in certain directions

1137.29 --> 1143.8
it does all kinds of things but I have

1140.86 --> 1145.9299999999998
to admit that it's not it's not

1143.8 --> 1148.1499999999999
perfectly balanced and that's why it is

1145.93 --> 1155.47
a problem that's why it could because I

1148.15 --> 1157.93
had a drug problem no righteous force

1155.47 --> 1162.49
well I don't smoke cigarettes I really

1157.93 --> 1164.98
don't I don't like it the only reason I

1162.49 --> 1168.76
would smoke a cigarette is because I ran

1164.98 --> 1171.97
out of cannabis and kind of like want a

1168.76 --> 1176.02
mental replacement but I don't really

1171.97 --> 1178.3500000000001
enjoy just tobacco I don't enjoy it

1176.02 --> 1178.35
anymore

1183.32 --> 1191.49
but combining cannabis with just a

1188.43 --> 1194.3100000000002
little tobacco just enough does provide

1191.49 --> 1196.89
like an extra element to the the

1194.31 --> 1199.77
experience that that yeah it's not the

1196.89 --> 1206.13
same if you should just smoke pure it's

1199.77 --> 1213.84
just not the same to me spare room music

1206.13 --> 1217.1100000000001
well cannabis can temporarily cause like

1213.84 --> 1219.33
a little anxiety and that can of course

1217.11 --> 1222.09
lead to paranoia but that's usually

1219.33 --> 1225.3
temporary unless the person really

1222.09 --> 1228.06
latches on to it and then sicom

1225.3 --> 1231.93
somatically basically reinforces it and

1228.06 --> 1235.26
then they can yeah go crazy but I

1231.93 --> 1237.78
usually when I smoke experience slight

1235.26 --> 1240.6299999999999
anxiety for a short while especially if

1237.78 --> 1243.36
I hadn't smoked for a while but it

1240.63 --> 1245.46
always goes away and I know exactly how

1243.36 --> 1249.54
it is like so I know like oh there's a

1245.46 --> 1251.46
slight twist to my feelings don't get

1249.54 --> 1254.67
fooled and then it'll just drop away

1251.46 --> 1258.21
back to normal and I'm always prepared

1254.67 --> 1260.8200000000002
for that it's one of the things people

1258.21 --> 1263.04
tend to forget and I've always forget

1260.82 --> 1264.96
when I haven't smoked cannabis for a

1263.04 --> 1268.95
long time and then suddenly that comes

1264.96 --> 1272.25
back and the anxiety can give all kinds

1268.95 --> 1277.8
of weird side effects if you're not

1272.25 --> 1281.61
prepared it can also be like an

1277.8 --> 1286.56
unleashing effect where it just breaks

1281.61 --> 1288.3899999999999
your composure I don't know but it only

1286.56 --> 1290.34
really works when you haven't smoked for

1288.39 --> 1294.5
a very long time or if it would be like

1290.34 --> 1296.8799999999999
the first time like it broke me open

1294.5 --> 1301.14
when I used it the first time and that

1296.88 --> 1303.8700000000001
was I think when I was 15 secretly of

1301.14 --> 1305.97
course it's not legal but yeah you're

1303.87 --> 1306.51
screwed I'm a teenager to do anything

1305.97 --> 1309.99
wrong

1306.51 --> 1315.36
I'll do our one that was me when I was

1309.99 --> 1317.28
15 so I tried that and it

1315.36 --> 1320.9099999999999
was the first time we're in the presence

1317.28 --> 1323.27
of others it broke me open and suddenly

1320.91 --> 1325.89
I would just start talking and

1323.27 --> 1328.23
expressing my inner ideas it just

1325.89 --> 1331.41
happened and that was the first time

1328.23 --> 1333.84
ever that that really started it's like

1331.41 --> 1339.03
a storytelling tradition just started

1333.84 --> 1343.6999999999998
and that's become a part of me never

1339.03 --> 1343.7
went away even when I stopped smoking so

1343.79 --> 1350.58
it can break your composure break you

1346.71 --> 1354.299
open out of self reinforced clamps that

1350.58 --> 1355.58
kind of thing but there's yeah not

1354.299 --> 1358.2
necessarily cannabis there's other

1355.58 --> 1366.87
experiences that can cause that as well

1358.2 --> 1368.3700000000001
I don't know it's been studied yeah

1366.87 --> 1371.61
that's right over McQuaid oh of course

1368.37 --> 1374.1499999999999
it all does I'm just generalizing what

1371.61 --> 1374.1499999999999
it can do

1382.4 --> 1390.71
what are you talking about Datak i've

1386.059 --> 1397.01
been formed on delusion what are you

1390.71 --> 1401.3
trolling me i already i told you very

1397.01 --> 1404.15
detailed how that works how i recognize

1401.3 --> 1406.49
it and then let it go and return back to

1404.15 --> 1410.18
normal don't engage in anything that

1406.49 --> 1414.95
comes out of that Darren I just told you

1410.18 --> 1417.3200000000002
how I don't form things from delusion

1414.95 --> 1427.55
this sounds really disingenuous what

1417.32 --> 1431.96
you're doing here right well that's

1427.55 --> 1434.1499999999999
that's one experience and I can explain

1431.96 --> 1438.29
how that happened I just told you I was

1434.15 --> 1441.38
in a reinforced clamp I had a lot of bad

1438.29 --> 1444.6499999999999
social experiences and I was afraid to

1441.38 --> 1447.13
express myself because I had undergone

1444.65 --> 1450.8000000000002
like torturous punishment and

1447.13 --> 1452.66
psychological attack from people nobody

1450.8 --> 1454.6399999999999
realized even how much damage they were

1452.66 --> 1456.71
doing and teachers were barely aware of

1454.64 --> 1459.6200000000001
it I didn't tell my parents at all

1456.71 --> 1462.38
because I had this weird honor delusion

1459.62 --> 1464.78
for myself that it wasn't supposed to be

1462.38 --> 1468.8300000000002
able to handle that but had no idea of

1464.78 --> 1470.809
that damage they were actually doing in

1468.83 --> 1473.1499999999999
that that's not normal I thought I was

1470.809 --> 1476.57
normal I thought it's like oh yeah it's

1473.15 --> 1479.51
because I am smarter that's gonna happen

1476.57 --> 1482.059
it's supposed to be like that but that's

1479.51 --> 1485.21
not a type of realization a kid should

1482.059 --> 1487.67
be having but it did cause me to just

1485.21 --> 1490.46
retract naturally it's like it wasn't

1487.67 --> 1492.38
efficient to be as expressive as I was I

1490.46 --> 1495.8600000000001
really became totally introverted and

1492.38 --> 1499.0900000000001
then only later much later I got in a

1495.86 --> 1501.1699999999998
more safe environment school with people

1499.09 --> 1504.8899999999999
that are more sensitive more

1501.17 --> 1506.929
intelligence on average so yeah that

1504.89 --> 1509.75
wasn't so much looked down upon there

1506.929 --> 1512.3500000000001
and then yeah just got smoked and any

1509.75 --> 1515.07
broke me open and suddenly I got a

1512.35 --> 1517.799
verbal tradition going

1515.07 --> 1519.269
and that's just a one-time event I'm not

1517.799 --> 1521.61
saying that that happens every time

1519.269 --> 1525.21
although there are some there's the

1521.61 --> 1528.4799999999998
typical early stage cannabis use tends

1525.21 --> 1530.309
to have several effects like certain

1528.48 --> 1533.07
types of things you do like you can get

1530.309 --> 1535.73
really hungry you can get a laughing fit

1533.07 --> 1540.389
that just won't stop

1535.73 --> 1543.69
you can also some people can become like

1540.389 --> 1546.6899999999998
obsessively chatty just keep on going

1543.69 --> 1548.6000000000001
and going it's a familiar kind of is

1546.69 --> 1553.049
used know exactly what that's like right

1548.6 --> 1559.35
and I guess I wrote on that effect to

1553.049 --> 1561.0
just open myself at that time because I

1559.35 --> 1561.6
couldn't do it by myself I didn't know

1561.0 --> 1565.59
how I

1561.6 --> 1568.1999999999998
I had forgotten because I was introvert

1565.59 --> 1571.019
for such a long time and my fear kept me

1568.2 --> 1573.75
in that place and then the drug

1571.019 --> 1582.36
basically dissolved that and suddenly I

1573.75 --> 1585.149
could just get out what no I've never

1582.36 --> 1589.519
smoked anything other than tobacco and

1585.149 --> 1589.5189999999998
and cannabis no never

1592.42 --> 1600.23
well except for was it the clover in in

1597.8 --> 1603.86
in cigarettes special type yeah that's

1600.23 --> 1605.93
it's comes from a Indonesian tradition

1603.86 --> 1607.6999999999998
it is in my bloodline it was confronted

1605.93 --> 1617.75
and I liked it that's all

1607.7 --> 1619.75
Oh or whatever right no I don't

1617.75 --> 1622.85
recognize it

1619.75 --> 1624.98
you know cannabis especially in the

1622.85 --> 1629.57
nails can have all kinds of weird names

1624.98 --> 1632.03
and combinations and I just look for the

1629.57 --> 1635.8899999999999
red yeah the the division of the

1632.03 --> 1639.53
original strand like how much sativa or

1635.89 --> 1644.3600000000001
indica it is and I prefer the indicas

1639.53 --> 1645.83
because that's better for me that's it

1644.36 --> 1648.01
that's the only thing I really care

1645.83 --> 1648.01
about

1654.92 --> 1664.72
no FEV or F earth Vader that that's not

1659.93 --> 1669.29
true Karen B was active last weekend and

1664.72 --> 1674.23
you might not have known but she is

1669.29 --> 1678.1
currently engaging in a new show with

1674.23 --> 1682.04
mark sergeant's so they yeah

1678.1 --> 1684.53
Patricia stair went away and she kind of

1682.04 --> 1688.04
stepped in and from what I've seen is

1684.53 --> 1703.8799999999999
really good so no she's definitely still

1688.04 --> 1706.58
active control of the flow how about

1703.88 --> 1708.98
just people you can rely upon because

1706.58 --> 1714.11
you've experienced them and have seen

1708.98 --> 1717.38
their skills and yeah you are you think

1714.11 --> 1719.4099999999999
it is just do well to put them in a

1717.38 --> 1722.8100000000002
certain position to keep the show going

1719.41 --> 1727.43
because it is a show that is what

1722.81 --> 1729.59
YouTube is that is the format so to say

1727.43 --> 1736.13
is like some kind of gatekeeping or

1729.59 --> 1739.48
conspiracy that's just you so you that

1736.13 --> 1739.48
that's all I can say about that

1747.59 --> 1754.7289999999998
mmm potato curry

1764.76 --> 1771.809
now now PJ the the problem is is that

1769.62 --> 1775.08
just your train of thought is very

1771.809 --> 1777.96
familiar to be and it's really just

1775.08 --> 1780.9189999999999
putting me to sleep because you're not

1777.96 --> 1783.63
going anywhere it's just useless

1780.919 --> 1787.44
paranoid rambling

1783.63 --> 1801.919
it's totally delusional and I'm kind of

1787.44 --> 1801.919
getting used to that from you now Oh God

1804.169 --> 1809.2990000000002
all right F earth Vader it doesn't have

1807.6 --> 1814.7099999999998
to say that anywhere

1809.299 --> 1817.65
it's an antecedent in order for gas

1814.71 --> 1821.64
pressure to exist there must be a

1817.65 --> 1824.929
container it is the antecedent it

1821.64 --> 1829.2900000000002
doesn't need to be written out somewhere

1824.929 --> 1831.8400000000001
that's like oh yeah make sure everywhere

1829.29 --> 1834.6299999999999
on the Internet it is written out in an

1831.84 --> 1836.6689999999999
icon that two plus two is four

1834.63 --> 1839.6100000000001
it means of course people could

1836.669 --> 1842.8090000000002
calculate it but it needs to be said it

1839.61 --> 1844.559
needs to be written down everywhere oh

1842.809 --> 1847.9189999999999
don't be an idiot

1844.559 --> 1851.4289999999999
it's the antecedent you don't need it to

1847.919 --> 1853.98
be written the antecedent factor is

1851.429 --> 1856.46
written and that is really all you need

1853.98 --> 1856.46
to know

1862.55 --> 1871.1699999999998
yeah yeah I'm saying it over and over

1868.2 --> 1873.98
again because that is the word you need

1871.17 --> 1878.79
to be focusing on in order to understand

1873.98 --> 1881.7
what it is we are talking about the the

1878.79 --> 1884.33
train of thought the construction of the

1881.7 --> 1884.3300000000002
reasoning

1901.09 --> 1908.4399999999998
really okay I guess you're gonna go with

1905.87 --> 1911.3
the atmospheric pressure from Google

1908.44 --> 1914.14
it's probably gonna be quite silly

1911.3 --> 1914.1399999999999
button nose

1928.47 --> 1932.24
and barometric pressure

1944.929 --> 1954.169
mm this is hilarious yeah they have the

1951.619 --> 1957.259
weird story that the pressure comes from

1954.169 --> 1959.45
the weight of the air above solids that

1957.259 --> 1962.089
is free that is just that ridiculous

1959.45 --> 1964.849
story the guy inserted once remember

1962.089 --> 1967.039
what's pushing on top of it the slightly

1964.849 --> 1969.529
thinner air layer above that and one on

1967.039 --> 1971.69
top of that is slightly and kept on

1969.529 --> 1976.07
going internally I think that's pretty

1971.69 --> 1980.839
much said here in the atmospheric

1976.07 --> 1984.249
pressure Wikipedia file maybe I should

1980.839 --> 1984.249
show it it's funny

2000.559 --> 2002.59
ah

2005.77 --> 2011.33
alright the mechanism according to

2008.78 --> 2014.78
Wikipedia atmospheric pressure is caused

2011.33 --> 2019.1599999999999
by the gravitational attraction of the

2014.78 --> 2023.54
planet hmm on the atmosphere I have

2019.16 --> 2025.28
gravity so it's an attraction oh it's

2023.54 --> 2028.01
not the bending of space-time anymore it

2025.28 --> 2031.16
sounds very Newtonian anyway moving on

2028.01 --> 2036.65
they had mature gases above the surface

2031.16 --> 2040.0900000000001
and there's a function of mass planet

2036.65 --> 2042.2900000000002
the radius the surface the amount of

2040.09 --> 2046.8999999999999
composition of the gases and their

2042.29 --> 2050.149
vertical distribution in the atmosphere

2046.9 --> 2053.389
just a modified by the planet Jesus

2050.149 --> 2057.3199999999997
Christ what a that is word salad if I've

2053.389 --> 2060.58
ever read it my god that something

2057.32 --> 2060.5800000000004
rumpus would try to say

2069.88 --> 2077.4300000000003
hmm oh look a pressure chart that's

2074.8 --> 2077.4300000000003
interesting

2079.17 --> 2086.67
average mean sea level pressure huh cool

2094.23 --> 2101.73
right okay so yeah that's obviously

2096.859 --> 2105.109
filled up with the total nonsense that

2101.73 --> 2105.109
we've all been subjected to

2120.67 --> 2125.81
cool

2122.0 --> 2127.91
yeah the boiling what the water boiling

2125.81 --> 2129.5
point differential according to the

2127.91 --> 2134.1099999999997
pressure is mentioning it for some

2129.5 --> 2134.11
reason so that's interesting

2142.43 --> 2150.109
oh wow hold on this is special an

2147.92 --> 2152.7200000000003
important application of the knowledge

2150.109 --> 2154.5789999999997
that atmospheric pressure varies

2152.72 --> 2157.91
directly with altitude was in

2154.579 --> 2160.2200000000003
determination or or was in determining

2157.91 --> 2162.2
the height of hills and mountain thanks

2160.22 --> 2167.23
to the availability of reliable pressure

2162.2 --> 2170.8999999999996
measurement devices while in 70-74

2167.23 --> 2176.329
masculine was confirming newton's theory

2170.9 --> 2180.38
of gravitation at and on shi Hallion in

2176.329 --> 2183.01
scotland using the plumb bob deviation

2180.38 --> 2185.809
to show the effect of gravity augury and

2183.01 --> 2188.4500000000003
accurately measuring elevation were

2185.809 --> 2190.4
william roy using barometric pressure

2188.45 --> 2194.4199999999996
was able to confirm his height

2190.4 --> 2200.02
determination the agreement being to

2194.42 --> 2203.329
within one meter this method became and

2200.02 --> 2206.779
continues to be useful for survey work

2203.329 --> 2209.15
and work and map may be making no key is

2206.779 --> 2212.569
really application of science gave

2209.15 --> 2214.789
people inside into how science could

2212.569 --> 2218.029
easily be put to practical use this

2214.789 --> 2222.3390000000004
seems extremely outdated since I thought

2218.029 --> 2227.2
that Newtonian gravity the support these

2222.339 --> 2229.97
these supposed experiments that

2227.2 --> 2232.1899999999996
Newtonian that would confirm Newtonian

2229.97 --> 2234.1699999999996
gravity were overturned as false and

2232.19 --> 2240.2200000000003
besides I think that Newton didn't even

2234.17 --> 2243.41
claim hypothesis so this seems oddly

2240.22 --> 2246.74
outdated why is it hasn't it been

2243.41 --> 2248.48
updated with with Einstein in principles

2246.74 --> 2251.93
that are now the standard that seems

2248.48 --> 2258.71
kind of what's it called again quote

2251.93 --> 2262.569
mining hmm essence new word I learned

2258.71 --> 2262.569
thanks to debates

2262.66 --> 2269.98
anyway yeah ok this page is just total

2266.51 --> 2273.8590000000004
horseshit it's a nice summary of all the

2269.98 --> 2289.7
propaganda nonsense

2273.859 --> 2289.7
thanks for that what

2295.42 --> 2299.92
right yeah reckoner Stefan Alison that's

2298.359 --> 2303.279
a good point the atmospheric pressure

2299.92 --> 2308.38
but it they just unnaturally separated

2303.279 --> 2311.799
it because gas pressure is defined quite

2308.38 --> 2333.599
differently that's true I could look it

2311.799 --> 2333.599
up what no that's not what

2338.7 --> 2341.85
[Music]

2346.1 --> 2354.35
well okay I'm trying to find gas

2351.71 --> 2367.2200000000003
pressure on Wikipedia and it doesn't

2354.35 --> 2370.5499999999997
give me a result that's new yeah yep f

2367.22 --> 2374.4199999999996
evader I already told you the evidence

2370.55 --> 2378.8500000000004
is based in that gas requires a

2374.42 --> 2381.9500000000003
container in order to have pressure

2378.85 --> 2386.12
it's the antecedent so don't know why

2381.95 --> 2398.83
you keep on asking the same question I'm

2386.12 --> 2398.83
gonna what

2401.12 --> 2409.37
okay in Wikipedia I had to scroll down

2406.01 --> 2413.2000000000003
it's only defined as pressure they lil

2409.37 --> 2415.37
they left the word gas out of it weird

2413.2 --> 2416.93
anyway yeah let me share this for a

2415.37 --> 2419.35
second so you can just look at the

2416.93 --> 2419.35
difference

2439.57 --> 2442.38
hmm

2448.69 --> 2451.53
okay

2465.99 --> 2478.8089999999997
okay I understand what they did now

2473.069 --> 2481.869
that's that's extremely devious they

2478.809 --> 2485.8590000000004
they took gas pressure as a separate

2481.869 --> 2487.9300000000003
thing away and they put it and right

2485.859 --> 2490.96
next to ya

2487.93 --> 2495.0099999999998
wait pressure that thing they put it in

2490.96 --> 2497.17
they put it in the same category so it's

2495.01 --> 2499.329
it's not complete here although yeah you

2497.17 --> 2501.069
can just look for the laws of

2499.329 --> 2505.329
thermodynamics but that's a separate

2501.069 --> 2515.4
article so they they now form the whole

2505.329 --> 2515.4
thing Wow that is that's just evil

2523.67 --> 2530.579
they're making some real work of it

2526.47 --> 2532.7389999999996
these days machinations manipulations

2530.579 --> 2537.2690000000002
are really spreading out they're really

2532.739 --> 2540.92
making work of it I wonder how much

2537.269 --> 2540.9199999999996
money is being poured into that

2541.3 --> 2544.4990000000003
[Music]

2553.48 --> 2561.359
no no there is a container if there's

2557.65 --> 2568.48
gas pressure there's a container and

2561.359 --> 2571.7799999999997
that's not gonna end ever so look if you

2568.48 --> 2577.03
are all going to contract this cyclic

2571.78 --> 2580.0
email virus this forced this forced

2577.03 --> 2582.25
break with reality in order to establish

2580.0 --> 2588.099
in outer space being out there

2582.25 --> 2591.7
I will ban you all okay because I will

2588.099 --> 2593.38
never let myself be infected by that

2591.7 --> 2595.6899999999996
[ __ ] no matter how much peer

2593.38 --> 2598.2400000000002
pressure no matter if I get demonetised

2595.69 --> 2602.79
no matter if I get blocked or striked or

2598.24 --> 2606.5789999999997
everybody goes unsubscribed screw you

2602.79 --> 2609.2799999999997
gas pressure has a container as an

2606.579 --> 2612.25
antecedent and that's that that's a fact

2609.28 --> 2616.5400000000004
no matter how much they screw up

2612.25 --> 2620.56
Wikipedia with their sickly heliocentric

2616.54 --> 2622.7799999999997
machinations I don't give a [ __ ] there

2620.56 --> 2624.79
is a container I don't know what the

2622.78 --> 2629.8190000000004
dimensions of this container are I don't

2624.79 --> 2634.99
know what the barrier whatever it may be

2629.819 --> 2638.369
how it is made how it is shape what it

2634.99 --> 2643.4199999999996
is I don't know but there must be a

2638.369 --> 2646.7200000000003
limited confine for this realm in in its

2643.42 --> 2648.91
dimensional qualities it cannot be any

2646.72 --> 2651.24
other way or they would not be gas

2648.91 --> 2651.24
pressure

2656.41 --> 2661.85
unless get things get ultimately weird

2659.75 --> 2663.89
and nobody's even talking about that

2661.85 --> 2667.67
[ __ ] I've suggested and that is the

2663.89 --> 2669.3799999999997
outer gas universe and who knows imagine

2667.67 --> 2671.48
now would be based on the globe outer

2669.38 --> 2674.0
gas universe with balls everywhere well

2671.48 --> 2677.12
who knows maybe it's just an infinitely

2674.0 --> 2680.57
high tunnel with infinite room and

2677.12 --> 2686.2999999999997
potentially infinite gas within it

2680.57 --> 2689.6000000000004
everywhere it's just somehow stretched

2686.3 --> 2695.6000000000004
off infinitely or just unattainable high

2689.6 --> 2702.2599999999998
I don't know but there are dimensions to

2695.6 --> 2705.71
the container and at no point within the

2702.26 --> 2708.8300000000004
container is there a vacuum ever it's

2705.71 --> 2711.37
not going to happen I'm gonna eat this

2708.83 --> 2711.37
peach now

2738.32 --> 2743.55
[Music]

2746.79 --> 2750.17
[Music]

2751.15 --> 2757.04
yeah

2752.48 --> 2759.079
you don't know and I don't know but I do

2757.04 --> 2763.57
know there must be a container in order

2759.079 --> 2763.57
for gas pressure to be there get over it

2773.03 --> 2780.0800000000004
yeah

2775.49 --> 2782.5699999999997
look if you really want to know go write

2780.08 --> 2786.44
a science fiction book about it or find

2782.57 --> 2791.1200000000003
out but stop bothering me with [ __ ] that

2786.44 --> 2796.28
obviously I can't know I can only give

2791.12 --> 2799.6099999999997
you a range of possibilities structure

2796.28 --> 2803.03
eyes in a very orderly way and that's it

2799.61 --> 2811.19
because I don't have that knowledge stop

2803.03 --> 2814.01
whining about it you don't know you're

2811.19 --> 2817.31
probably never gonna find out but who

2814.01 --> 2819.59
knows maybe at some point you will we

2817.31 --> 2823.18
will I don't know but we don't know

2819.59 --> 2831.07
right now and you got to get over that

2823.18 --> 2831.0699999999997
you can't base your view of reality on

2831.88 --> 2839.23
which view has been filled in the most

2835.81 --> 2842.84
that makes no sense that's insane

2839.23 --> 2852.41
quantity over quality concerning

2842.84 --> 2857.21
knowledge is ridiculous psychotic what

2852.41 --> 2864.1099999999997
you need is honesty honesty to yourself

2857.21 --> 2867.86
and then reflect that upon what what you

2864.11 --> 2871.2200000000003
are exposed to what you learn so that

2867.86 --> 2874.51
you may look clearly and distinguish the

2871.22 --> 2874.5099999999998
false from the true

2877.74 --> 2885.6699999999996
it's not meant to fill in all your

2882.19 --> 2889.57
knowledge that's not what the mechanism

2885.67 --> 2892.96
is for it's in order to distinguish the

2889.57 --> 2896.7400000000002
false from the true the only way to

2892.96 --> 2900.75
attain the knowledge is to do things and

2896.74 --> 2900.75
not whine all day

2944.85 --> 2953.69
I think it's alright

2961.24 --> 2966.3289999999997
yeah you know what I may just leave him

2964.78 --> 2969.9900000000002
in there

2966.329 --> 2973.8390000000004
it worked with right to hand yesterday

2969.99 --> 2977.9199999999996
okay yeah that was coming I guess Amanda

2973.839 --> 2980.2599999999998
you don't blame you but yesterday right

2977.92 --> 2984.099
the hand again I started out to hang out

2980.26 --> 2988.3
talking about this he started talking in

2984.099 --> 2991.869
the chat was during the it was during

2988.3 --> 2999.4300000000003
the ball-busters premiere and he just

2991.869 --> 3001.23
went so deep so Vanya is so bad and I

2999.43 --> 3004.339
was like oh my god this needs to be

3001.23 --> 3008.67
banned and then I realized no wait

3004.339 --> 3012.5099999999998
my god why would I erase this treasure

3008.67 --> 3015.42
of self-destruction because it was so

3012.51 --> 3018.3590000000004
bad there's no way anybody's gonna fall

3015.42 --> 3020.73
for that it's only dragging himself is

3018.359 --> 3021.99
literally hanging himself with words

3020.73 --> 3026.19
right there so I just thought don't wait

3021.99 --> 3027.7799999999997
no because you know when trolls do it

3026.19 --> 3029.099
it's completely useless you don't even

3027.78 --> 3031.619
know who they are they're just getting

3029.099 --> 3033.6600000000003
in the way all that [ __ ] but when actual

3031.619 --> 3036.75
individuals that have a face that have a

3033.66 --> 3039.54
channel that people know who they are or

3036.75 --> 3043.74
do that then maybe it'd be better to

3039.54 --> 3047.7599999999998
just leave it there to just come yeah to

3043.74 --> 3052.2299999999996
help progress the entropy let the words

3047.76 --> 3057.42
that have come out of them rot in the

3052.23 --> 3064.2
open be exposed to exchange energy and

3057.42 --> 3066.78
just progress the rot so henceforth if

3064.2 --> 3071.39
people that are proven to be actual

3066.78 --> 3074.6400000000003
people in chat are really misbehaving

3071.39 --> 3077.16
I'm inclined to just let them do that

3074.64 --> 3079.98
and when I figure out their irredeemable

3077.16 --> 3084.1189999999997
no longer respond and let them just barf

3079.98 --> 3088.68
their guts out in chat unless they get

3084.119 --> 3093.2000000000003
into really evil maniacal threatening

3088.68 --> 3096.5
territory then maybe and you know but

3093.2 --> 3102.1699999999996
yeah it was just a realization like wait

3096.5 --> 3104.75
maybe I should kind of change my

3102.17 --> 3106.79
approach between the real trolls and the

3104.75 --> 3108.47
spammers that are faceless and the

3106.79 --> 3110.69
actual individuals that are known that

3108.47 --> 3112.9399999999996
are misbehaving and just actually let

3110.69 --> 3116.54
them do that and I hope that you guys

3112.94 --> 3118.809
are going to help me in that as well in

3116.54 --> 3118.8089999999997
chat

3119.47 --> 3122.6299999999997
[Music]

3136.079 --> 3141.15
Zep tepi I don't even know what right

3138.849 --> 3144.4
the hand is anymore

3141.15 --> 3149.009
he let himself contract the chemo virus

3144.4 --> 3152.309
okay the guy is I thought he was smart

3149.009 --> 3155.0190000000002
but it seems that his lack of

3152.309 --> 3158.44
self-discipline is so bad that it

3155.019 --> 3160.479
literally disjunct his entire mental

3158.44 --> 3164.38
process and he's gone into full

3160.479 --> 3166.96
retardation and this it's really sad

3164.38 --> 3171.9100000000003
it's all that potential just burning

3166.96 --> 3174.359
away so sad but it's gone so bad I don't

3171.91 --> 3178.42
know if he's redeemable at this point

3174.359 --> 3180.67
like I hope he doesn't like crash like

3178.42 --> 3182.319
crash and burn you know he's going so

3180.67 --> 3184.089
bad if this would continue I don't know

3182.319 --> 3188.979
what the hell it would do might go out

3184.089 --> 3192.19
and do really bad things I don't know

3188.979 --> 3195.569
I'm not saying he will but if it just

3192.19 --> 3198.759
makes me nervous to see somebody

3195.569 --> 3200.94
disintegrate their entire character like

3198.759 --> 3200.94
that

3206.89 --> 3209.43
yeah

3227.89 --> 3232.23
all right mark colored yeah that's

3230.14 --> 3236.8289999999997
correct if you have a real belief

3232.23 --> 3239.47
there's nothing to hide you just need to

3236.829 --> 3242.38
live it that's the real belief if you

3239.47 --> 3245.98
have a belief and it works live it and

3242.38 --> 3249.6400000000003
it shall be revealed if it is correct

3245.98 --> 3252.099
through logos through the response if

3249.64 --> 3256.5989999999997
you are evading the path without knowing

3252.099 --> 3259.319
it shall be made known to you it will

3256.599 --> 3259.319
reveal itself

3283.95 --> 3290.6699999999996
what no I haven't seen that look I wow

3288.75 --> 3295.44
that that really sounds like a

3290.67 --> 3298.109
crash-and-burn thing to do my god maybe

3295.44 --> 3304.73
we should actually stop laughing at him

3298.109 --> 3304.73
