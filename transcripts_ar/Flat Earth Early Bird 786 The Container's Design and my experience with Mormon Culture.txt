29.85 --> 36.59
[Music]

62.52 --> 68.56
good morning welcome to flat earth early

66.159 --> 70.96000000000001
bird number 786

68.56 --> 72.96000000000001

90.479 --> 99.6
that would be much appreciated right

95.6 --> 103.119
today the weather is

99.6 --> 106.55999999999999
quite beautiful out there

103.119 --> 108.399
it's been very nice and sunny right now

106.56 --> 109.759
there's a cloud in front of the sun of

108.399 --> 112.84
course but

109.759 --> 116.399
i don't know it should be going away

112.84 --> 116.399
anytime right there

116.479 --> 120.719
it's overall been a very beautiful clear

119.119 --> 124.0
blue sky

120.719 --> 126.15899999999999
just a couple of clouds some

124.0 --> 127.6
trails in the distance but yeah not

126.159 --> 131.03900000000002
enough to

127.6 --> 131.039
obstruct the sun

131.76 --> 137.51999999999998
a lot of people walking outside enjoying

134.16 --> 137.52
it and jogging and stuff

137.92 --> 144.39999999999998
because yeah the wind is very still

141.84 --> 148.239
there is a lot of moist in the air

144.4 --> 148.239
but it's just very refreshing

148.319 --> 152.56
type of weather for a beautiful sunday

154.84 --> 157.84
right

158.8 --> 162.4
yeah starting on time

164.239 --> 168.31900000000002
hey hello robin stanley good morning

169.28 --> 178.4
very early bird i got green tea with me

173.36 --> 178.4
it's still a little hot and tested

184.0 --> 186.319
right

190.879 --> 196.72
so last night was a lot more

194.56 --> 198.4
restful than it was the night before so

196.72 --> 201.04
i feel pretty well rested

198.4 --> 201.04
this morning

204.879 --> 209.35999999999999
and yeah the just very nice waking up to

207.44 --> 213.84
that kind of sun

209.36 --> 213.84
very early bird yep yes you are

217.36 --> 221.59900000000002
right so yeah despite that good mood

221.84 --> 226.08
it's a little bit of a bad news point i

225.04 --> 229.76
guess

226.08 --> 233.12
because that's gonna go

229.76 --> 236.959
come out anyway but apparently i think

233.12 --> 240.799
yesterday uh

236.959 --> 243.92000000000002
yeah kiwi quantum eraser

240.799 --> 246.4
john he basically shared with

243.92 --> 249.439
the guys in the skype chat that his

246.4 --> 249.439
mother had died

250.239 --> 255.84
which is of course for any man always a

252.72 --> 255.84
big shock

256.079 --> 260.079
doesn't really matter what what your age

258.0 --> 263.759
is so yeah

260.079 --> 265.84000000000003
very sorry for him really yeah for me

263.759 --> 269.84000000000003
was a big shock when that happened

265.84 --> 269.84
all that all those years ago but

272.88 --> 280.56
so my yeah my extensive condolences to

276.72 --> 280.56
to john i hope you get through this

280.639 --> 283.919
he said he wouldn't be on for for at

283.36 --> 287.6
least two

283.919 --> 290.79999999999995
yeah for two weeks or something so

287.6 --> 293.199
yeah hold in hold strong john

290.8 --> 293.199
and just

294.16 --> 297.84000000000003
hope you get through it all right

298.4 --> 300.79999999999995
anyway

302.24 --> 308.32
hello roger what happened

306.08 --> 309.12
i don't know what happened just heard

308.32 --> 313.759
that she

309.12 --> 316.8
yeah that his mom passed away uh

313.759 --> 317.36
nothing dramatic on top of that i don't

316.8 --> 319.759
know why

317.36 --> 322.16
what happens it's probably just natural

319.759 --> 325.759
causes completely

322.16 --> 327.6
i don't know maybe we'll learn about it

325.759 --> 333.12
maybe not it's his private life

327.6 --> 333.12
after all yeah quantum erasers

336.84 --> 339.84
aj

341.199 --> 353.84000000000003
so yeah anyway

361.919 --> 366.4
yeah despite that news uh flat earth

364.8 --> 368.639
debate the uh

366.4 --> 370.0
from what was it thursday was really

368.639 --> 380.08
good listening back to it

370.0 --> 384.0
was really intense with rumpus

380.08 --> 386.88
and i was really proud of my

384.0 --> 388.319
uh yeah my contributions to it certain

386.88 --> 391.36
questions i asked it was really

388.319 --> 391.36
interesting too because

392.8 --> 400.40000000000003
like rumpus pretty much revealed

396.479 --> 403.199
to us in that show

400.4 --> 405.75899999999996
that mercury doesn't abide by the

403.199 --> 409.199
newtonian mechanics

405.759 --> 412.47900000000004
like the orbit of mercury so and then he

409.199 --> 414.96000000000004
explained like

412.479 --> 416.8
indirectly explained and i kind of like

414.96 --> 420.08
unraveled that

416.8 --> 423.84000000000003
that einstein gravity

420.08 --> 426.15999999999997
does work out supposedly

423.84 --> 427.599
former the orbit of mercury and that it

426.16 --> 430.8
is yeah

427.599 --> 432.88
the conceptual medium of

430.8 --> 434.56
pseudo-romanian force base could be

432.88 --> 437.84
considered to be

434.56 --> 440.8
conjured up to fill the gaps that cannot

437.84 --> 444.479
be fixed through newtonian mechanics

440.8 --> 447.36
but instead of just realizing that

444.479 --> 449.919
the newtonian mechanics is an ins like

447.36 --> 451.599
an incomplete model it doesn't work out

449.919 --> 453.28
there's something wrong with it because

451.599 --> 456.71999999999997
they can't make the

453.28 --> 459.28
mercury mercury in orbit fit

456.72 --> 460.16
the model that means it doesn't work at

459.28 --> 461.75899999999996
all

460.16 --> 464.40000000000003
and that you basically have to start

461.759 --> 467.84000000000003
from scratch in order to fix it but

464.4 --> 470.479
they have just not done that

467.84 --> 471.67999999999995
and instead conjured up a fictional

470.479 --> 474.87899999999996
medium to explain

471.68 --> 475.599
in an unreachable other dimension how it

474.879 --> 480.08000000000004
is

475.599 --> 482.0
possible which is like

480.08 --> 484.479
not critical thinking at all it's very

482.0 --> 487.919
juvenile way

484.479 --> 491.44
of explaining things it's not

487.919 --> 492.87899999999996
it's not physics sound

491.44 --> 494.879
uh how do you call it yeah it's not a

492.879 --> 497.91900000000004
sound form of reasoning

494.879 --> 500.24
within how physics is established at all

497.919 --> 502.639
right so that that was good to look

500.24 --> 507.84000000000003
through that again

502.639 --> 507.84000000000003
hope you guys enjoyed that

510.16 --> 517.44
right on the other hand yeah

513.68 --> 517.4399999999999
the news about john's mom i don't know

518.959 --> 521.8389999999999
it's just sad

522.159 --> 525.36
but it's not the end of the world you

523.919 --> 528.0799999999999
know eventually

525.36 --> 528.08
we all die

528.48 --> 534.16
and hey at least john's mom just lucky

531.839 --> 535.839
enough to have a really awesome son

534.16 --> 537.68
i don't know if he has brothers and

535.839 --> 540.72
sisters

537.68 --> 542.8
but yeah that means successful in my

540.72 --> 549.839
book

542.8 --> 549.8389999999999
john's a pretty cool guy so

550.8 --> 555.5999999999999
right i don't know enough though to

553.44 --> 556.1600000000001
really make any kind of judgment and why

555.6 --> 559.12
would i

556.16 --> 560.7199999999999
but it just feels like she's ascended to

559.12 --> 565.6
heaven

560.72 --> 568.88
oh yeah right anyway

565.6 --> 572.64
please don't leave my chat on that

568.88 --> 572.64
come back and say something else

573.839 --> 577.2
both sets of grandparents very different

576.88 --> 581.04
from

577.2 --> 581.0400000000001
when both parents are good right

584.72 --> 588.8000000000001
i can't imag well i can't imagine thank

587.12 --> 591.279
god not completely

588.8 --> 593.5999999999999
but for me it's pretty much my dad's

591.279 --> 593.6
left

595.519 --> 600.08
because all my grandparents are gone and

598.08 --> 605.839
my mother

600.08 --> 605.839
and yeah

618.88 --> 624.0
like in a way it's it's complicated but

624.32 --> 631.519
yeah i really want my dad to

628.88 --> 632.72
experience being a grandad because i

631.519 --> 635.12
think it would be

632.72 --> 637.6
really good for him like it would be

635.12 --> 640.88
something he's really good at

637.6 --> 643.9200000000001
and he's wise enough so much

640.88 --> 646.32
that just

643.92 --> 647.1999999999999
like he's not allowed to go yet not

646.32 --> 652.32
before i get

647.2 --> 652.32
kids and i kind of told him

655.6 --> 660.0
but every time i do he's always like no

657.68 --> 663.1999999999999
no don't worry man just

660.0 --> 665.519
just let it happen like

663.2 --> 667.76
if it was meant to be it was meant to be

665.519 --> 667.76
and

667.839 --> 671.44
and he's always like no i'll be i'll be

670.24 --> 674.88
all right i will

671.44 --> 679.9200000000001
survive for a very long time

674.88 --> 682.399
so hopefully that will happen on my side

679.92 --> 683.76
every time i hear somebody i i know

682.399 --> 686.959
their parents

683.76 --> 689.8389999999999
passing away i always like oh my did

686.959 --> 689.8389999999999
dad hold on

709.2 --> 713.44
my grandmother was right it's such a

710.88 --> 717.2
blessing now yeah

713.44 --> 718.9590000000001
right well i'm experiencing how much of

717.2 --> 719.44
a blessing it is through others now i

718.959 --> 722.16
can't

719.44 --> 723.2790000000001
really the weird thing is because i'm

722.16 --> 726.7199999999999
not i can't

723.279 --> 729.8389999999999
perfectly emulate

726.72 --> 732.72
what it's like to be a parent but a lot

729.839 --> 732.72
of it i can

733.68 --> 738.6389999999999
just through empathy so i know it is

736.88 --> 740.48
like when you compare the people that

738.639 --> 743.36
don't with the people that do

740.48 --> 744.0
is just very telling throughout my life

743.36 --> 746.639
it's like i

744.0 --> 750.24
measured this up with everybody i just

746.639 --> 750.24
i'm constantly observing

750.8 --> 755.12
these things and especially energy

752.639 --> 758.48
levels because people

755.12 --> 762.48
it passes them by

758.48 --> 762.48
they most people don't really

762.72 --> 766.399
consciously notice they respond to

765.12 --> 768.399
spirit things

766.399 --> 770.16
but they don't really consciously know

768.399 --> 772.24
it it's just like oh

770.16 --> 774.0
this is happening then you do this they

772.24 --> 777.36
don't really think about it i do

774.0 --> 778.959
a lot and i've always been very

777.36 --> 780.16
observant of this since i was a very

778.959 --> 783.5189999999999
little kid

780.16 --> 786.8
right hey hello nathan oakley

783.519 --> 790.639
good morning here

786.8 --> 793.92
right yeah i heard it was

790.639 --> 796.639
it's been very snowy in england just

793.92 --> 796.639
made a snowman

798.839 --> 804.639
cool

801.519 --> 808.079
over here it's it's not snowy at all

804.639 --> 808.0790000000001
it's just really beautiful

811.279 --> 815.8389999999999
it's a nice sun

820.079 --> 823.68
very picturesque outlook a lot of the

822.639 --> 826.9590000000001
time this like

823.68 --> 830.2399999999999
the netherlands has very beautiful skies

826.959 --> 831.279
and some of the old dutch painters were

830.24 --> 843.839
very famous for

831.279 --> 843.8389999999999
painting those guys

845.199 --> 851.76
we'll be skiing today but like cool

848.56 --> 853.5999999999999
huh so yeah i know

851.76 --> 854.8
i know you've been looking forward to

853.6 --> 856.639
that

854.8 --> 858.88
glad you'll have the opportunity to do

856.639 --> 858.88
that

866.09 --> 872.24
[Music]

869.6 --> 874.88
okay roger when is that when is it going

872.24 --> 874.88
to get cold

883.76 --> 888.56
but if it's gonna get cold again it's

885.68 --> 891.92
probably going to be around my birthday

888.56 --> 894.3199999999999
because in the past it's been very

891.92 --> 895.519
often that right on my birthday it's

894.32 --> 899.1990000000001
snowing

895.519 --> 901.519
or it's snow covered

899.199 --> 903.68
for some reason happens a lot of the

901.519 --> 905.68
time it's like if that one

903.68 --> 907.68
time in the year it's gonna snow it's

905.68 --> 908.88
very likely to snow on my birthday i

907.68 --> 913.8389999999999
don't know why

908.88 --> 913.8389999999999
it's been like that for over a decade

932.72 --> 935.1990000000001
oh wow

937.279 --> 942.56
okay nathan well it's good to have some

940.72 --> 943.36
driving skills when it's snowing and all

942.56 --> 945.8389999999999
that

943.36 --> 948.48
but is does that also mean that the

945.839 --> 950.72
roads are frozen up

948.48 --> 953.04
so not just snow is the road also

950.72 --> 956.72
slippery

953.04 --> 956.7199999999999
because that's a whole different story

956.959 --> 961.5999999999999
if it's like really freezing and there's

959.279 --> 961.6
snow

965.519 --> 969.04
whoa so there's a real cold spell going

968.639 --> 983.839
on

969.04 --> 983.8389999999999
in england okay

994.839 --> 997.839
hmm

1008.839 --> 1011.839
do

1014.399 --> 1018.88
yeah as for what i've been doing i yeah

1016.56 --> 1021.199
i've been behind my computer a lot

1018.88 --> 1023.279
as usual it's really most of my

1021.199 --> 1025.4389999999999
activities

1023.279 --> 1026.7
i'm particularly proud of it but hey i

1025.439 --> 1028.959
do it

1026.7 --> 1032.079
[Music]

1028.959 --> 1035.28
i better just be honest about it

1032.079 --> 1038.48
but yeah i've been gaming more

1035.28 --> 1038.799
baldur's gate 3 i am getting more used

1038.48 --> 1042.559
to

1038.799 --> 1046.4
how it's working it it's not

1042.559 --> 1047.52
all that great i've many complaints

1046.4 --> 1050.0800000000002
surprise surprise

1047.52 --> 1053.52
it's just i'm not gonna bother you guys

1050.08 --> 1056.08
with that sort of thing

1053.52 --> 1057.2
and other than that also been watching a

1056.08 --> 1058.8799999999999
lot of south park

1057.2 --> 1061.8400000000001
going through the series i'm now at

1058.88 --> 1064.64
season eight already so i've been really

1061.84 --> 1066.48
going through it and it's fascinating

1064.64 --> 1069.6000000000001
because i just remembered

1066.48 --> 1071.2
when i watched it sporadically in the

1069.6 --> 1075.1999999999998
past

1071.2 --> 1077.2
connected to well situations back then

1075.2 --> 1080.24
it's like south park was almost this

1077.2 --> 1082.88
weird kind of surreal secret news

1080.24 --> 1084.72
in its own way and it's just fascinating

1082.88 --> 1087.919
to watch it all again

1084.72 --> 1087.919
and see what it was like

1088.48 --> 1091.84
from yeah from much later and it's

1091.2 --> 1095.8400000000001
really

1091.84 --> 1097.9189999999999
it's it's better than i thought it was

1095.84 --> 1100.799
even it's incredible

1097.919 --> 1102.16
so i'm really appreciating the whole

1100.799 --> 1109.84
series

1102.16 --> 1109.8400000000001
so far anyway

1109.919 --> 1123.8400000000001

[Music]

1268.32 --> 1273.6789999999999
no sorry

1274.559 --> 1278.6399999999999
i checked out your video about alien

1277.6 --> 1281.6
formation that

1278.64 --> 1284.3200000000002
seems a little pc level do you know

1281.6 --> 1284.32
about pj

1284.48 --> 1291.84
he's a lot into that sort of thing

1296.42 --> 1299.559
[Music]

1301.73 --> 1305.039
[Music]

1303.44 --> 1306.48
right i don't know what his channel is

1305.039 --> 1308.32
these days

1306.48 --> 1310.4
but he typically hangs around in the

1308.32 --> 1313.12
flat earth debate chats

1310.4 --> 1315.1200000000001
also in premieres and all that so you

1313.12 --> 1317.76
might want to

1315.12 --> 1318.4799999999998
check that out so are you into flat

1317.76 --> 1320.8799999999999
earth

1318.48 --> 1321.6
do you do did you know the earth was

1320.88 --> 1333.8400000000001
flat

1321.6 --> 1333.84
john mallory

1339.6 --> 1345.9189999999999
ah all right so how long have you known

1342.64 --> 1361.8400000000001
when did you find out where when did it

1345.919 --> 1361.8400000000001
shine through

1376.63 --> 1379.719
[Music]

1400.84 --> 1403.84
what

1407.52 --> 1412.32
uh i do not know about

1412.799 --> 1419.28
what okay that

1417.44 --> 1421.039
sorry that doesn't make a lot of sense

1419.28 --> 1423.9189999999999
to me

1421.039 --> 1431.84
everything's flat what do you mean

1423.919 --> 1431.8400000000001
everything is flat

1442.64 --> 1450.7990000000002
i kind of disagree it's it's that

1445.84 --> 1450.799
yeah pictures and a screen

1451.279 --> 1459.84
those things are flat but there's a lot

1455.12 --> 1459.84
of things out there that aren't flat

1463.36 --> 1469.6
oh and if you zoom in on any surface

1467.2 --> 1473.8400000000001
to a microscopic level you'll find out

1469.6 --> 1473.84
that it's not flat at all

1475.2 --> 1487.6000000000001
but i yeah i don't exactly know

1478.799 --> 1490.0
what you're implying

1487.6 --> 1490.0
what

1492.559 --> 1497.279
when we were raised from the dead what

1497.84 --> 1501.84
what are you talking about john mallory

1532.0 --> 1534.64
the word

1539.2 --> 1545.919
like are you

1542.32 --> 1548.72
under a microscope yeah are you on your

1545.919 --> 1548.72
phone because

1548.88 --> 1552.0
it seems like you're having a bit of

1550.32 --> 1555.12
trouble

1552.0 --> 1558.48
typing because

1555.12 --> 1560.3999999999999
it's either that or you're a bit of a

1558.48 --> 1562.32
confused person

1560.4 --> 1566.0
so i'm giving it the benefit of the

1562.32 --> 1566.0
doubts and saying that it's probably

1566.159 --> 1570.88
yeah your ability to type because

1569.36 --> 1573.6
some people have a lot of trouble on

1570.88 --> 1575.679
that on the phone yeah i thought so

1573.6 --> 1585.36
right because i would have a lot of

1575.679 --> 1589.039
trouble trying it on the phone too

1585.36 --> 1592.24
i prefer keys you know click

1589.039 --> 1598.72
and my phone too i hate touch screen

1592.24 --> 1602.48
systems i freaking hate it

1598.72 --> 1604.4
because with the key it clicks and then

1602.48 --> 1608.08
you don't need to look anymore because

1604.4 --> 1608.0800000000002
you can feel it it's purely tacked out

1608.48 --> 1613.84
and then you know by the click whether

1610.08 --> 1613.84
it worked and the position

1615.76 --> 1621.52
[Music]

1617.919 --> 1626.96
right anyway but yeah

1621.52 --> 1631.84
you're confusing me a little about word

1626.96 --> 1631.8400000000001
the word you probably meant world right

1634.159 --> 1638.0800000000002
you didn't know the world wasn't flat so

1636.64 --> 1641.8400000000001
what nobody

1638.08 --> 1641.84
told you it was a globe

1645.36 --> 1649.4399999999998
like were you raised in a particular

1647.52 --> 1650.6399999999999
type of christian school or something

1649.44 --> 1653.1200000000001
where they just

1650.64 --> 1655.8400000000001
didn't teach you about that or how did

1653.12 --> 1655.84
that work out

1656.159 --> 1660.0800000000002
oh you the word of the holy bible what

1666.0 --> 1669.6
well that one is up for debate though

1668.159 --> 1672.64
you know

1669.6 --> 1674.32
i'm not gonna say no it doesn't say the

1672.64 --> 1676.5590000000002
world is flat

1674.32 --> 1678.0
what i would say first and foremost is

1676.559 --> 1680.399
that there is no clue or

1678.0 --> 1683.039
inkling whatsoever in the bible that the

1680.399 --> 1688.4799999999998
earth is a spinning globe in outer space

1683.039 --> 1688.48
that part i can absolutely confirm

1689.679 --> 1696.3200000000002
but yeah the bible does not

1693.039 --> 1698.96
truly in my opinion reveal the complete

1696.32 --> 1700.08
nature of the realm it just reveals

1698.96 --> 1703.44
certain

1700.08 --> 1704.32
traits and elements and hey a lot of

1703.44 --> 1711.8400000000001
things we can

1704.32 --> 1711.84
basically derive from physics

1713.679 --> 1717.919
and yeah there's for example there's a

1715.679 --> 1721.2
lot of people out there that

1717.919 --> 1723.2
that really really don't like

1721.2 --> 1725.6000000000001
for some reason the idea that the world

1723.2 --> 1730.0
is completely flat

1725.6 --> 1732.24
so they say oh it's not perfectly flat

1730.0 --> 1733.039
and to that for example my response

1732.24 --> 1736.48
would be okay

1733.039 --> 1738.64
the world is flat enough

1736.48 --> 1739.76
the geometrical orientation of the

1738.64 --> 1744.7990000000002
earth's surface

1739.76 --> 1744.799
is as good as flat flat enough

1745.12 --> 1753.84
definitely not spherical

1764.84 --> 1769.6789999999999
so

1766.48 --> 1771.52
well what john mallory i don't know what

1769.679 --> 1774.64
you're referring to here this is

1771.52 --> 1778.08
getting a bit confusing what

1774.64 --> 1781.3600000000001
word above his head

1778.08 --> 1784.6399999999999
who is he his

1781.36 --> 1784.6399999999999
when god reads the word

1789.44 --> 1796.3200000000002
right from the surface i would interpret

1792.72 --> 1796.32
that esoterically and say

1796.799 --> 1803.36
when some really big

1800.559 --> 1804.72
thing that is good and connects to god

1803.36 --> 1807.6789999999999
is revealed to you

1804.72 --> 1808.0
you gain insight on it and you could say

1807.679 --> 1811.1200000000001
the

1808.0 --> 1816.159
word or the inside

1811.12 --> 1816.1589999999999
the oversight is revealed upon you

1818.0 --> 1823.84
so in that sense maybe the word is above

1820.24 --> 1823.84
your head

1826.48 --> 1831.679
from a godly view well that happens in

1828.799 --> 1831.679
your mind that's

1833.679 --> 1839.919
inside right so the the truth

1837.44 --> 1842.64
is basically just inside and the closer

1839.919 --> 1845.8400000000001
you get to the truth

1842.64 --> 1851.8400000000001
the more things start to make sense

1845.84 --> 1851.84
why things happen the way they do

1852.72 --> 1857.279
but also a lot of challenges are

1854.64 --> 1859.279
revealed in yourself

1857.279 --> 1862.08
that you have to overcome or they'll

1859.279 --> 1862.08
overtake you

1863.36 --> 1867.84
every revelation every new depth of

1866.159 --> 1870.72
insight

1867.84 --> 1872.6399999999999
yeah reveals another personal challenge

1870.72 --> 1874.88
at least for a lot of people for me it

1872.64 --> 1874.88
does

1875.679 --> 1879.679
because there's things inside of you and

1878.399 --> 1883.12
me

1879.679 --> 1885.279
that don't really want to know we don't

1883.12 --> 1888.4799999999998
want to have all our dreams broken

1885.279 --> 1891.76
naturally it's not like you want to stay

1888.48 --> 1894.88
comfortable and that includes the dream

1891.76 --> 1894.8799999999999
and a lot of insight

1895.039 --> 1897.519
what the

1898.32 --> 1901.84
hey hello amanda young why did you time

1901.519 --> 1907.84
out

1901.84 --> 1907.84
john mallory

1918.84 --> 1924.1589999999999
okay

1920.159 --> 1924.159
be a little bit more careful this is

1927.25 --> 1931.339
[Music]

1932.84 --> 1937.279
right

1934.32 --> 1937.279
yeah i get that

1938.83 --> 1945.12
[Music]

1941.919 --> 1945.1200000000001
right but i was saying

1946.159 --> 1949.279
every time you get a little bit more

1948.399 --> 1951.279
grip there

1949.279 --> 1952.32
are seductions there are seductions for

1951.279 --> 1956.399
power

1952.32 --> 1963.4399999999998
there are seductions for pessimism

1956.399 --> 1967.12
there are seductions for

1963.44 --> 1967.1200000000001
yeah for forgetfulness

1968.72 --> 1972.72
there are all these things it's like

1970.32 --> 1976.399
every new level of power brings a new

1972.72 --> 1979.679
level of resistance and you have to

1976.399 --> 1982.9599999999998
go through that and see

1979.679 --> 1986.64
how much you can fend off and stay

1982.96 --> 1991.8400000000001
focused on i don't know the long term

1986.64 --> 1991.8400000000001
thing you're doing

1992.72 --> 1997.44
and yeah when you go through that is

1995.279 --> 1998.96
palpable on a spiritual level to the

1997.44 --> 2000.799
outside you don't even have to talk

1998.96 --> 2002.72
about it but people feel it and they

2000.799 --> 2005.84
respond spiritually to it

2002.72 --> 2005.84
and so a lot of people

2006.96 --> 2012.08
that have made bad choices and can't

2009.76 --> 2015.44
face those bad choices

2012.08 --> 2018.6399999999999
will then be

2015.44 --> 2020.559
subconsciously drawn to attack you

2018.64 --> 2022.96
because to them

2020.559 --> 2023.84
you shine a bright light even though you

2022.96 --> 2025.679
have you

2023.84 --> 2028.32
don't necessarily have to speak about it

2025.679 --> 2030.24
but if they just catch on

2028.32 --> 2031.6789999999999
use it's like a bright light shining in

2030.24 --> 2034.88
their eyes and they

2031.679 --> 2037.519
convictions about it because

2034.88 --> 2038.5590000000002
they're trying to defend they use those

2037.519 --> 2041.679
convictions

2038.559 --> 2044.0
to prevent themselves from going there

2041.679 --> 2044.88
and to justify why they don't have to

2044.0 --> 2048.72
feel guilty

2044.88 --> 2051.679
about their inability

2048.72 --> 2051.6789999999996
that's how it works

2055.28 --> 2062.96
so that will happen that also happens

2057.839 --> 2062.96
when you reach your new inside

2065.28 --> 2068.5600000000004
so yeah it

2071.359 --> 2075.839
anyways very esoteric like this

2076.96 --> 2080.8
but it applies to a lot of things

2081.44 --> 2091.04
a lot of experiences

2088.96 --> 2103.839
i thought you would probably recognize

2091.04 --> 2103.839
it all of you out there

2105.04 --> 2111.7599999999998
right john mallory should be back

2108.72 --> 2111.7599999999998
in a minute or so

2113.28 --> 2120.1600000000003
amanda jung accidentally timed him out

2117.52 --> 2120.16
it happens

2125.28 --> 2130.48
it's one of the pitfalls of mobile

2128.839 --> 2132.96
interface

2130.48 --> 2135.44
although it's not exclusive too

2132.96 --> 2136.8
especially when a chat is very busy and

2135.44 --> 2145.839
quick

2136.8 --> 2145.8390000000004
that sort of thing can happen

2166.72 --> 2170.56
all right so what's going on out there

2171.44 --> 2187.839
there's snow in england i got that far

2226.839 --> 2229.839
so

2240.88 --> 2243.839
hmm

2254.839 --> 2257.839
right

2270.8 --> 2277.599
all right so yeah i'm looking for

2274.4 --> 2277.599
something to talk about

2277.92 --> 2281.76
is there anything right i remember now

2280.8 --> 2285.8390000000004
what's it

2281.76 --> 2285.8390000000004
called again

2287.599 --> 2290.4
let me find it

2293.119 --> 2299.839
man i get a lot of pop-ups

2300.64 --> 2313.839
what's this

2324.839 --> 2327.839
what

2328.72 --> 2335.68
oh god it can be such a hassle having so

2332.079 --> 2338.7200000000003
many things you're subscribed to

2335.68 --> 2341.1189999999997
especially if you don't exactly remember

2338.72 --> 2343.7599999999998
the name ah

2341.119 --> 2343.76
almost had it

2347.28 --> 2355.8390000000004
this channel's not gone is it

2356.16 --> 2364.0
ah there it is yeah i watched another

2360.72 --> 2366.64
uh video from robert zephier again

2364.0 --> 2369.359
who is not or doesn't seem to be a flat

2366.64 --> 2373.04
earth or he's more like a

2369.359 --> 2373.04
hollow earther he follows another

2376.16 --> 2380.16
sort of thing sort of yeah narrative you

2379.2 --> 2382.0789999999997
could say

2380.16 --> 2383.44
and he had a very interesting video

2382.079 --> 2387.2000000000003
yesterday

2383.44 --> 2387.2000000000003
about the atlantean empire

2393.2 --> 2400.96
don't know that if anybody's seen that

2397.52 --> 2400.96
had a lot of references

2402.4 --> 2405.6800000000003
that you might recognize

2405.839 --> 2412.319
it's also about right the origin of the

2409.119 --> 2412.319
aryans and all that

2413.359 --> 2416.0789999999997
it's a certain

2416.8 --> 2425.8390000000004
yeah historical cosmology it's real and

2419.44 --> 2425.839
also like how

2426.4 --> 2432.96
what is it the yeah the fish

2429.76 --> 2434.48
people anyway

2432.96 --> 2436.56
you should check it out it's really

2434.48 --> 2440.079
fantastical

2436.56 --> 2440.0789999999997
but interesting

2446.56 --> 2451.52
ah you did watch that here we go again

2448.88 --> 2455.52
cool anyway i put it in the chat

2451.52 --> 2455.52
it's just very interesting

2456.0 --> 2458.96
to ponder upon

2460.319 --> 2464.64
and yeah for me when i watch that sort

2462.64 --> 2467.2799999999997
of thing i'm trying to

2464.64 --> 2469.52
puzzle my conceptions in there

2467.28 --> 2470.5600000000004
concerning giants and the pyramids and

2469.52 --> 2473.599
all that

2470.56 --> 2475.839
and technology because i'm i'm just

2473.599 --> 2478.88
trying to figure out how could that have

2475.839 --> 2481.2799999999997
all manifested like what it was

2478.88 --> 2483.119
really like from like an industrial

2481.28 --> 2485.0400000000004
standpoint

2483.119 --> 2488.2400000000002
from an industrial perspective that's

2485.04 --> 2492.24
how i am trying to

2488.24 --> 2494.8799999999997
look at a lot of the far past like

2492.24 --> 2496.0
not like this happened that happened oh

2494.88 --> 2500.48
where did it come from but

2496.0 --> 2502.8
just like what was it actually like

2500.48 --> 2507.04
because i think that a lot of things

2502.8 --> 2510.319
that i guess historians and

2507.04 --> 2513.68
all that in the past

2510.319 --> 2514.24
they they puzzled together things in the

2513.68 --> 2517.359
past

2514.24 --> 2521.4399999999996
in a certain way they

2517.359 --> 2523.5989999999997
colored it and i think that a lot of the

2521.44 --> 2525.44
actual

2523.599 --> 2527.52
knowledge of what it was like is kind of

2525.44 --> 2530.16
lost you don't really find that back

2527.52 --> 2531.359
and how people have filled it in is just

2530.16 --> 2534.64
like more negative

2531.359 --> 2536.7999999999997
more dumb it's based on the

2534.64 --> 2538.7999999999997
idea of evolution and that it started

2536.8 --> 2540.96
all stupid and slow and

2538.8 --> 2541.92
like that that's like the vantage point

2540.96 --> 2544.64
for the people

2541.92 --> 2546.2400000000002
basically fabricating or back

2544.64 --> 2551.839
engineering

2546.24 --> 2551.839
the history

2552.0 --> 2558.319
and i just disagree with that notion i

2554.319 --> 2558.319
think that humanity is always

2559.44 --> 2563.68
going through a lot of swings and it has

2562.319 --> 2567.7599999999998
incredible

2563.68 --> 2570.3999999999996
potential like all the time

2567.76 --> 2572.3190000000004
so i'm just trying to see like okay with

2570.4 --> 2574.7200000000003
all these things that were there

2572.319 --> 2576.839
what was it like like what if the

2574.72 --> 2581.9199999999996
atlantean age was really

2576.839 --> 2581.92
metropolitan like very much

2583.76 --> 2588.3190000000004
something people don't really think

2585.28 --> 2588.3190000000004
about a lot i think

2591.44 --> 2595.44
anyway yeah

2604.319 --> 2607.839
ah welcome back john mallory

2616.0 --> 2618.24
what

2619.359 --> 2627.2799999999997
gravity's no gravity is not real

2624.24 --> 2635.839
gravity is a reification fallacy

2627.28 --> 2635.8390000000004
it's not it's not a physical thing

2636.88 --> 2640.1600000000003
in reality there's a relative density or

2639.76 --> 2644.1600000000003
just

2640.16 --> 2647.2
density is what you might find it back

2644.16 --> 2650.24
as in books just density

2647.2 --> 2652.3999999999996
it's the density and in yeah

2650.24 --> 2654.24
in the relative density theory it's the

2652.4 --> 2656.319
density of the object

2654.24 --> 2657.68
versus the density of the medium it is

2656.319 --> 2661.359
in

2657.68 --> 2664.48
that will did cause a force

2661.359 --> 2667.359
a displacement an acceleration

2664.48 --> 2669.599
for the density to find equilibrium and

2667.359 --> 2671.839
if it is denser than the medium it is in

2669.599 --> 2673.92
then it will go down

2671.839 --> 2677.839
because that is where all the denser

2673.92 --> 2677.839
things gather

2678.079 --> 2683.52
right and if it is less dense than the

2680.0 --> 2683.52
medium it is in it will go up

2686.72 --> 2690.319
a gravity suggests that there is a

2688.88 --> 2693.44
unified

2690.319 --> 2697.599
singular directional force

2693.44 --> 2699.839
application a force field if you will

2697.599 --> 2703.04
that basically causes all these things

2699.839 --> 2705.04
but there's no proof for this

2703.04 --> 2706.8
and by the way this gravity theory is

2705.04 --> 2708.4
kind of what goes colloquially around

2706.8 --> 2710.88
because when you trace it back through

2708.4 --> 2713.359
the physics history

2710.88 --> 2714.2400000000002
there's no not really even an official

2713.359 --> 2718.56
claim for that

2714.24 --> 2721.7599999999998
at all and instead

2718.56 --> 2724.72
there is einstein gravity which

2721.76 --> 2726.48
transpires completely in a fictional

2724.72 --> 2730.0789999999997
medium

2726.48 --> 2730.079
in a non-3d world

2731.44 --> 2737.599
so yeah gravity is

2734.56 --> 2737.599
is science fiction

2737.76 --> 2743.28
what really happens what causes the

2741.04 --> 2744.839
passive displacement things falling or

2743.28 --> 2748.2400000000002
things going up

2744.839 --> 2749.52
naturally without any introduction of

2748.24 --> 2753.1189999999997
some kind of

2749.52 --> 2756.0
mechanical force is

2753.119 --> 2756.7200000000003
that displacement is caused by relative

2756.0 --> 2759.44
density

2756.72 --> 2760.9599999999996
this equilibrium this equilibrium

2759.44 --> 2775.839
between the density

2760.96 --> 2775.839
of an object and the medium it is in

2789.52 --> 2794.319
gravity conceived specifically to hide

2792.0 --> 2798.64
the flat earth

2794.319 --> 2798.64
night no no it

2800.839 --> 2807.04
gravity

2802.319 --> 2807.04
is basically a reason to justify

2809.92 --> 2818.4
it's a conception to justify how

2812.96 --> 2821.28
a ball can act like it does

2818.4 --> 2822.2400000000002
within a vacuum of outer space and

2821.28 --> 2825.0400000000004
that's

2822.24 --> 2826.3999999999996
excluding the gas parts that's how it

2825.04 --> 2828.72
was fabricated so

2826.4 --> 2830.4
fabricated on top of that the earth

2828.72 --> 2833.2799999999997
would be a ball

2830.4 --> 2833.28
in outer space

2833.599 --> 2839.52
so it's like a mathematical

2836.52 --> 2839.52
justification

2840.24 --> 2845.839
an excuse for how why

2848.72 --> 2852.3999999999996
but yeah if the earth is not a ball and

2850.96 --> 2854.559
it is flat

2852.4 --> 2856.7200000000003
then gravity yeah it doesn't really

2854.559 --> 2859.8390000000004
matter

2856.72 --> 2859.839
because it's not really a ball

2860.48 --> 2864.079
there's no real point for it to be there

2863.2 --> 2867.52
because

2864.079 --> 2871.6800000000003
you don't need a flexible

2867.52 --> 2873.52
force to make a ball in outer space

2871.68 --> 2875.5989999999997
because it isn't a ball so there's no

2873.52 --> 2879.68
real need for it

2875.599 --> 2884.319
and the physical reality is much easier

2879.68 --> 2884.319
and accurate to explain with relative

2884.839 --> 2887.839
density

2894.16 --> 2896.3999999999996
what

2897.92 --> 2901.839
okay anton

2904.48 --> 2915.839
god is not young jesus what

2919.44 --> 2929.839
there's something you're afraid of anton

2955.119 --> 2961.2000000000003
hey in the mail forever gravity is

2958.16 --> 2964.3999999999996
justification for directionality

2961.2 --> 2966.48
well for directionality presupposing the

2964.4 --> 2970.0
earth is a ball

2966.48 --> 2972.0
gravity would be a necessary concept in

2970.0 --> 2974.64
order for

2972.0 --> 2975.52
things to be drawn towards the center of

2974.64 --> 2978.72
a ball

2975.52 --> 2978.72
that's really the main

2979.2 --> 2985.839
reason for it to have been conjured up

2990.16 --> 3002.48
oh hdmi traveler

2999.04 --> 3002.48
ideas on the firmament

3006.079 --> 3010.319
right well yeah the firmament

3011.68 --> 3016.24
like what is the firmament really when

3014.319 --> 3020.72
it is described

3016.24 --> 3020.72
you know like

3021.44 --> 3024.96
i wonder sometimes if the firmament is

3024.319 --> 3029.599
just

3024.96 --> 3032.319
the fill in based purely on the

3029.599 --> 3034.079
yeah on the logical knowledge that there

3032.319 --> 3034.96
is gas pressure so it has to be a

3034.079 --> 3036.88
container

3034.96 --> 3038.48
and the firmament is just like okay

3036.88 --> 3041.839
that's just

3038.48 --> 3041.839
the conceptualized lid

3042.4 --> 3050.0
that allows gas pressure

3046.4 --> 3053.28
because nobody's ever touching it

3050.0 --> 3056.72
nobody's standing on the other side

3053.28 --> 3056.7200000000003
or something right

3062.88 --> 3071.28
okay john mallory

3068.96 --> 3071.28
what

3074.559 --> 3080.88
what are you on about this everything is

3077.04 --> 3080.88
flat not everything is flat

3081.2 --> 3084.0789999999997
that's just dumb

3094.24 --> 3097.4399999999996
that's maybe you're just playing around

3096.4 --> 3100.559
but yeah

3097.44 --> 3105.599
sorry anyway

3100.559 --> 3111.0400000000004
firmament right so if there is a

3105.599 --> 3115.2000000000003
stop to where

3111.04 --> 3118.24
matter can move into a containment

3115.2 --> 3119.7599999999998
up there somehow then yeah what could

3118.24 --> 3121.2799999999997
that be

3119.76 --> 3122.8
there's all kinds of things that i've

3121.28 --> 3126.3190000000004
conceptualized

3122.8 --> 3130.0
it could simply be an end of space

3126.319 --> 3132.4
like there is no more space

3130.0 --> 3134.96
in which material can go it's like here

3132.4 --> 3136.88
is when the dimension ends

3134.96 --> 3139.839
like yeah there is no more physical

3136.88 --> 3139.839
space so it's just like

3141.44 --> 3146.4
or maybe no sound whatever

3147.04 --> 3150.24
it's just like yeah nothing can go

3148.88 --> 3152.96
through that

3150.24 --> 3156.0789999999997
after that point that's one conception

3152.96 --> 3156.079
another one is that

3160.079 --> 3163.6800000000003
there may be some kind of physical

3162.0 --> 3167.119
barrier who knows what it is

3163.68 --> 3168.0
is it glass is it an energy barrier

3167.119 --> 3170.2400000000002
perhaps

3168.0 --> 3171.92
we might not be able to find out what

3170.24 --> 3176.3999999999996
it's even comprised of it may be

3171.92 --> 3176.4
non-material that acts like material

3178.72 --> 3182.7999999999997
like an energy shield or get even

3182.079 --> 3184.6400000000003
weirder

3182.8 --> 3186.7200000000003
within the looping concept now we're

3184.64 --> 3188.16
just discussing what it is

3186.72 --> 3191.2799999999997
what would the firm what would be

3188.16 --> 3194.5589999999997
container be comprised of right

3191.28 --> 3198.1600000000003
could also be the very bottom

3194.559 --> 3198.1600000000003
of the realm we're standing on

3198.72 --> 3203.5989999999997
if there is a looping segment up and

3201.2 --> 3206.3999999999996
down it might be

3203.599 --> 3207.3590000000004
it's an option it's not been absolutely

3206.4 --> 3210.48
excluded

3207.359 --> 3211.2799999999997
and who knows maybe there is this energy

3210.48 --> 3213.28
barrier

3211.28 --> 3214.6400000000003
where you can be beyond you could

3213.28 --> 3217.8390000000004
potentially stand on

3214.64 --> 3220.5589999999997
the other side and then way

3217.839 --> 3221.04
above it would be the bottom of the

3220.559 --> 3224.3190000000004
earth

3221.04 --> 3226.319
who knows some say that on the other

3224.319 --> 3226.96
side of the very there has to be water

3226.319 --> 3229.52
so

3226.96 --> 3230.7200000000003
water is water there has to be water for

3229.52 --> 3233.04
some reason

3230.72 --> 3234.64
i don't really see why although water is

3233.04 --> 3237.68
mentioned in the waters above

3234.64 --> 3240.72
and below blah blah all that

3237.68 --> 3243.44
yeah it's complicated

3240.72 --> 3245.4399999999996
as far as i'm concerned i don't see the

3243.44 --> 3246.0
necessity where there has to be material

3245.44 --> 3249.359
like a

3246.0 --> 3251.2
a giant realm sized ocean on the other

3249.359 --> 3253.92
side of a barrier

3251.2 --> 3257.359
i don't see that but a lot of flat

3253.92 --> 3257.359
earthers do seem to think that

3259.359 --> 3264.24
right and as for like what what is this

3262.88 --> 3268.4
barrier

3264.24 --> 3272.24
is it a dome or is it a something else

3268.4 --> 3274.0
if the earth is looping

3272.24 --> 3276.3999999999996
say east to west direction if the

3274.0 --> 3279.2
equator line is actually a straight line

3276.4 --> 3280.64
a perfectly geometrically straight line

3279.2 --> 3284.0789999999997
let's start out with that

3280.64 --> 3287.7599999999998
to not make it too complicated

3284.079 --> 3292.1600000000003
well then there's no need for a barrier

3287.76 --> 3294.3190000000004
geometrically to touch down

3292.16 --> 3295.44
when it comes to east or westward

3294.319 --> 3299.04
direction so

3295.44 --> 3301.839
yeah the the barrier could be

3299.04 --> 3301.839
like a tunnel

3303.44 --> 3309.52
right and then yeah

3306.64 --> 3310.4
proceed to draw it out even further say

3309.52 --> 3313.359
okay what if

3310.4 --> 3315.28
north and south actually also

3313.359 --> 3316.24
interconnects when you go farther north

3315.28 --> 3320.0
north north

3316.24 --> 3322.72
you end up south

3320.0 --> 3324.16
and then come back to the other side as

3322.72 --> 3327.2799999999997
it were

3324.16 --> 3330.24
well then there would have to be no

3327.28 --> 3330.2400000000002
touchdown point

3333.04 --> 3338.72
right just none

3336.48 --> 3340.0
and then you might say but what prevents

3338.72 --> 3343.839
the barrier from

3340.0 --> 3346.88
falling down well

3343.839 --> 3348.0
maybe if it is the top of the realm

3346.88 --> 3349.92
itself

3348.0 --> 3351.119
it's just comprised in a certain amount

3349.92 --> 3353.92
of space it's just

3351.119 --> 3354.7200000000003
like it can't fall down because it

3353.92 --> 3356.96
cannot

3354.72 --> 3358.8799999999997
because it would literally draw itself

3356.96 --> 3360.4
away from it so there would just be a

3358.88 --> 3362.799
set distance

3360.4 --> 3364.319
like what what space itself is not gonna

3362.799 --> 3367.04
crunch in order for that

3364.319 --> 3368.079
bottom of the thing that you're standing

3367.04 --> 3371.119
on

3368.079 --> 3373.8390000000004
to approach you so it may simply hang

3371.119 --> 3373.839
eternally

3373.92 --> 3380.799
because that is all there is

3377.2 --> 3384.319
or there might be some bizarre

3380.799 --> 3386.559
energy barrier based pillars somewhere

3384.319 --> 3389.04
or maybe a singular pillar maybe there

3386.559 --> 3391.119
is one pillar

3389.04 --> 3394.079
on which it all rests and there is an

3391.119 --> 3395.92
indestructible thing

3394.079 --> 3398.319
that might be magnetic mountain or

3395.92 --> 3398.319
something

3398.4 --> 3403.119
i don't know there's all these

3400.559 --> 3404.88
potentials

3403.119 --> 3419.839
how that could mechanically work and

3404.88 --> 3419.839
i've thought of it all

3427.76 --> 3432.079
right so yeah i hope that it was a

3430.839 --> 3434.0
entertaining

3432.079 --> 3436.7200000000003
it's all kinds of things of what the

3434.0 --> 3439.76
container can be in all kinds of ways

3436.72 --> 3443.1189999999997
if you just open up your mind

3439.76 --> 3444.8390000000004
just realize that well maybe everything

3443.119 --> 3447.6800000000003
is not

3444.839 --> 3451.119
perfectly like an endless

3447.68 --> 3451.52
space you know we were made to think

3451.119 --> 3455.2000000000003
that

3451.52 --> 3458.16
we were on a ball in endless space

3455.2 --> 3458.16
or who's to say

3458.319 --> 3463.119
that yeah there is some form of endless

3462.64 --> 3466.48
space

3463.119 --> 3469.359
in any kind of way that

3466.48 --> 3470.799
oh there is a we're in a bubble what is

3469.359 --> 3472.799
outside of the bubble

3470.799 --> 3474.559
who says there is anything outside the

3472.799 --> 3478.48
bubble who says there is

3474.559 --> 3478.48
space existing outside of it

3479.359 --> 3483.44
because we're made used to that through

3481.92 --> 3486.7200000000003
science fiction and through

3483.44 --> 3490.2400000000002
yeah school heliocentric thinking

3486.72 --> 3493.839
is there anything is there space to

3490.24 --> 3497.2799999999997
be to move into beyond

3493.839 --> 3499.52
the confines of the realm i don't think

3497.28 --> 3499.52
so

3499.839 --> 3505.52
unless it's compartmentalized and then

3501.839 --> 3508.24
there is an energy barrier of some kind

3505.52 --> 3509.839
in which you can physically exist beyond

3508.24 --> 3511.4399999999996
but even then beyond

3509.839 --> 3513.599
there would yeah there would be the

3511.44 --> 3515.92
other segment of the container

3513.599 --> 3516.799
and beyond that at some point nothing

3515.92 --> 3519.04
can exist

3516.799 --> 3520.559
it cannot go on eternally physical

3519.04 --> 3524.24
reality cannot go on

3520.559 --> 3526.6400000000003
eternally that's kind of a philosophical

3524.24 --> 3530.5589999999997
conclusion that i've drawn

3526.64 --> 3533.7599999999998
like i think that

3530.559 --> 3534.4
in the phys like a physical realm can

3533.76 --> 3537.76
never be

3534.4 --> 3542.1600000000003
infinite i think that

3537.76 --> 3542.1600000000003
physicality and infinity are

3542.839 --> 3545.839
incompatible

3549.92 --> 3553.039
[Music]

3567.28 --> 3573.8390000000004
okay squirrel sniper that's interesting

3579.68 --> 3582.96
you don't have to repeat it

3584.88 --> 3590.319
but yeah what exactly does that mean

3588.48 --> 3593.2
you know there's all kinds of ways i can

3590.319 --> 3593.2
interpret that as

3596.079 --> 3604.1600000000003
like is there an inability to measure it

3600.48 --> 3606.319
or it's too big and therefore will net

3604.16 --> 3607.04
like it's infinite size and therefore we

3606.319 --> 3610.64
will never

3607.04 --> 3615.839
attain completion you know

3610.64 --> 3615.839
you can interpret it both ways

3627.04 --> 3630.319
right you can never measure the

3628.559 --> 3634.559
container if you're

3630.319 --> 3634.5589999999997
locked inside of it right

3636.48 --> 3643.839
because you can't get outside of it to

3638.319 --> 3643.839
measure it

3656.24 --> 3659.52
wouldn't infinite regression denote

3658.72 --> 3663.4399999999996
physical

3659.52 --> 3663.44
infinity what

3668.839 --> 3685.839
ah

3671.359 --> 3685.839
what sorry i am having trouble

3691.599 --> 3697.6800000000003
like yeah lamell forever that's i

3694.96 --> 3700.799
i don't know maybe my english

3697.68 --> 3713.839
understanding is failing me my

3700.799 --> 3713.839
what what infinite regression

3721.52 --> 3728.64
oh dutch sailor look i've said that

3725.28 --> 3731.6800000000003
look there's bible believers that say

3728.64 --> 3731.68
it says it's flat

3732.72 --> 3736.9599999999996
i'm i'm willing to say that it excludes

3736.16 --> 3739.2799999999997
the earth from

3736.96 --> 3741.359
actually being his fear or having the

3739.28 --> 3744.2400000000002
traits of a sphere

3741.359 --> 3744.24
and that's about it

3745.599 --> 3752.96
i don't know if it literally says flat

3750.16 --> 3754.64
you know that's you can still put a ball

3752.96 --> 3758.48
or hat on

3754.64 --> 3758.48
and interpret that slightly different

3763.76 --> 3769.28
although maybe with certain descriptions

3766.319 --> 3771.92
it that's not so easy to do that

3769.28 --> 3774.2400000000002
so but yeah i'd like to leave it open

3771.92 --> 3774.2400000000002
because

3774.72 --> 3783.5989999999997
the bible does not

3777.92 --> 3786.319
perfectly describe what the realm is

3783.599 --> 3788.0
it gives you hints gives you rules and

3786.319 --> 3790.72
traits

3788.0 --> 3791.839
and then for yeah for you to find out it

3790.72 --> 3794.8799999999997
might have originally

3791.839 --> 3796.5589999999997
described it in perfect detail absolute

3794.88 --> 3811.839
perfect detail

3796.559 --> 3811.8390000000004
but i've never seen that

3845.76 --> 3850.3190000000004
no pillars it's turtles no

3851.839 --> 3854.64
now that's not

3856.799 --> 3863.359
i was talking about a potential

3859.839 --> 3866.88
pillar for the firmament

3863.359 --> 3869.119
for the container the phys

3866.88 --> 3870.799
some physical end of the container to

3869.119 --> 3875.119
rest upon that was the

3870.799 --> 3875.119
why i brought a pillar or pillars

3876.0 --> 3879.28
i don't know about any pillars on which

3878.079 --> 3881.8390000000004
the earth stands again

3879.28 --> 3884.1600000000003
unless you've interpreted as yeah hey

3881.839 --> 3886.5589999999997
it's those pillars are actually standing

3884.16 --> 3889.7599999999998
on the earth somewhere

3886.559 --> 3891.28
you go looping top down kind of idea

3889.76 --> 3895.8390000000004
right

3891.28 --> 3895.8390000000004
then who knows

3920.839 --> 3926.24
so

3922.24 --> 3926.24
okay what

3926.64 --> 3937.839
that's that sounds interesting but i

3929.039 --> 3937.8390000000004
don't know the context

3976.839 --> 3993.839
okay what exactly means

3980.4 --> 3993.839
and they stand as a garment

4000.15 --> 4003.369
[Music]

4004.4 --> 4007.92
and i like an item of clothing so how do

4007.599 --> 4012.1600000000003
you

4007.92 --> 4012.16
stand like an item of clothing that is

4013.68 --> 4021.839
i don't know how to interpret that

4030.64 --> 4038.319
yeah exactly oh so that's so specific

4034.799 --> 4040.48
like a piece of clothing what does that

4038.319 --> 4040.48
mean

4040.799 --> 4048.59
what type of clothing a jacket

4044.319 --> 4052.159
what this this is odd

4048.59 --> 4052.159
[Music]

4062.96 --> 4068.48
uh hello in the rhythm

4066.72 --> 4072.0
why is the container somehow

4068.48 --> 4073.76
automatically assumed and so important

4072.0 --> 4075.44
uh because we have gas pressure and

4073.76 --> 4078.4
we're breathing it

4075.44 --> 4078.4
and it's stable

4081.359 --> 4087.7599999999998
nature abhors a vacuum

4084.4 --> 4088.4
that's why it has to be a limited amount

4087.76 --> 4090.559
of space

4088.4 --> 4092.64
available for the gas pressure to expand

4090.559 --> 4095.92
it in

4092.64 --> 4098.4
and then once that has been achieved

4095.92 --> 4100.719
then yeah the dynamic system sets in

4098.4 --> 4103.839
with all the heat

4100.719 --> 4107.679
at ground level and then yeah

4103.839 --> 4110.5599999999995
over time pressure gradient

4107.679 --> 4112.319
also thanks to relative density but that

4110.56 --> 4114.080000000001
can only happen because there is a

4112.319 --> 4119.759
limited amount of space

4114.08 --> 4121.839
in which the gas pressure has settled

4119.759 --> 4123.12
right and why can't the container just

4121.839 --> 4125.199
be the cosmos

4123.12 --> 4126.719
because it's too big if it's all a

4125.199 --> 4130.799
vacuum out there that

4126.719 --> 4132.0
can't work out gas pressure would expand

4130.799 --> 4134.48
in all directions to fill

4132.0 --> 4135.92
it and then whatever gradient we would

4134.48 --> 4140.159
be left with would be

4135.92 --> 4144.4800000000005
not enough to breathe or for any life to

4140.159 --> 4144.48
not have all the liquids evaporated

4144.839 --> 4148.4
right so

4146.399 --> 4151.279
[Music]

4148.4 --> 4151.2789999999995
yeah that's

4159.04 --> 4161.839
oh my why

4190.239 --> 4194.718999999999
infinite regression fallacy you don't

4192.4 --> 4197.679
agree with it okay

4194.719 --> 4199.44
right well in that sense then i agree

4197.679 --> 4203.04
with you

4199.44 --> 4204.96
and i think

4203.04 --> 4208.4
when other people use the words like

4204.96 --> 4211.44
infinite regression fallacy in context

4208.4 --> 4213.92
i get it but it is like yeah

4211.44 --> 4215.678999999999
i'm not a master in these words really

4213.92 --> 4217.679
and pointing out the fallacies i can

4215.679 --> 4219.12
recognize it much better but i'm not a

4217.679 --> 4222.159
master

4219.12 --> 4222.159
like kiwi or

4222.239 --> 4229.12
a lot of the other guys in ways i see i

4225.44 --> 4232.4
almost feel like i regressed a little

4229.12 --> 4235.44
been drawn into other things more

4232.4 --> 4235.44
esoteric stuff

4238.159 --> 4241.12
more psychology

4241.92 --> 4247.12
more focusing also on just

4244.96 --> 4249.28
mind control and information and how it

4247.12 --> 4253.44
all works in the spirit of all things

4249.28 --> 4253.44
all that well yeah esoterics right

4253.92 --> 4258.4
but i think that as far as i remember

4256.159 --> 4262.719
infinite regression fallacies where

4258.4 --> 4262.719
yeah you just keep on

4265.12 --> 4268.88
like it's never going to be solved yeah

4267.92 --> 4272.159
and in physical

4268.88 --> 4273.84
physical physical nature and infinity

4272.159 --> 4275.199
that would work because there's such a

4273.84 --> 4277.679
thing as entropy and

4275.199 --> 4277.678999999999
it's just

4283.12 --> 4289.599999999999
like scale matters

4286.48 --> 4292.959999999999
scale matters for matter itself

4289.6 --> 4295.280000000001
how big how much

4292.96 --> 4296.2390000000005
different forces different effects come

4295.28 --> 4299.599999999999
into play

4296.239 --> 4303.28
with bigger sizes now if there is just

4299.6 --> 4307.4400000000005
theoretically conceptually infinite

4303.28 --> 4311.44
amount it's impossible

4307.44 --> 4311.44
it's just impossible this is just

4312.48 --> 4318.718999999999
nothing could be stable because there is

4316.08 --> 4329.84
infinite and infinite influence it's

4318.719 --> 4329.84
just too much

4334.96 --> 4340.64
you can have a gas pressure gradient in

4337.36 --> 4344.32
a very very large container well yes

4340.64 --> 4345.52
and i think that our realms container is

4344.32 --> 4348.5599999999995
very large

4345.52 --> 4350.159000000001
and we definitely have a gradient in it

4348.56 --> 4352.159000000001
there's a lot of different gases and

4350.159 --> 4355.28
there's a lot of different

4352.159 --> 4358.0
temperature influences

4355.28 --> 4360.32
as most temperature is actually

4358.0 --> 4363.44
introduced ground level or

4360.32 --> 4363.44
dare i say all of it

4364.239 --> 4367.678999999999
and thus that will effectively cause

4366.719 --> 4370.56
gases to

4367.679 --> 4371.28
evaporate materials to evaporate at

4370.56 --> 4374.56
ground level

4371.28 --> 4374.96
causing more gas pressure and above

4374.56 --> 4378.0
there

4374.96 --> 4381.6
it cools off and then maybe

4378.0 --> 4385.12
reverts back to an a non-gaseous state

4381.6 --> 4387.84
like water as an influence is a constant

4385.12 --> 4390.88
gradient happening

4387.84 --> 4393.28
but the container cannot be infinite

4390.88 --> 4393.28
sized

4394.4 --> 4401.759999999999
unless one would suggest that

4397.44 --> 4405.759999999999
yeah up there is also gas pressure

4401.76 --> 4405.76
very close to what we experience here

4406.96 --> 4411.6
right but then if there was like an

4409.52 --> 4414.0
infinite universe sized

4411.6 --> 4414.0
realm

4415.28 --> 4421.5199999999995
then we wouldn't have this gradient

4418.32 --> 4423.599999999999
not like it is right here it would be

4421.52 --> 4427.679
much more steady because we have an

4423.6 --> 4429.6
infinite container

4427.679 --> 4431.52
and yeah if we would have gas pressure

4429.6 --> 4431.92
it would have to all be pretty much the

4431.52 --> 4434.56
same

4431.92 --> 4437.36
ground level as as we experienced and

4434.56 --> 4440.56
not this gradient

4437.36 --> 4442.719
so the gradient is already kind of a

4440.56 --> 4446.4800000000005
sign that the container has to be much

4442.719 --> 4448.08
more limited in size

4446.48 --> 4449.759999999999
because otherwise the gradient would not

4448.08 --> 4451.44
manifest like that

4449.76 --> 4455.84
under any circumstance that's not

4451.44 --> 4455.839999999999
logical gradient doesn't

4455.92 --> 4462.56
there's no half way system and then

4459.199 --> 4464.799999999999
just keeps on going forever halfing

4462.56 --> 4467.04
that that doesn't make sense that's not

4464.8 --> 4469.6
how gas pressure

4467.04 --> 4471.44
response that's not how it will settle

4469.6 --> 4473.6
after it has

4471.44 --> 4475.5199999999995
expanded within the available container

4473.6 --> 4478.320000000001
that's not how it will settle

4475.52 --> 4479.120000000001
it's not how the universe would relate

4478.32 --> 4482.719
itself

4479.12 --> 4485.04
the gas within it versus earth

4482.719 --> 4487.52
yeah assuming that there's all other

4485.04 --> 4489.84
planets and all that also out there

4487.52 --> 4490.88
doing similar things that it doesn't

4489.84 --> 4494.4800000000005
work out it

4490.88 --> 4498.2390000000005
doesn't abide by the normal effects

4494.48 --> 4500.639999999999
of gradients it's like a gradient is a

4498.239 --> 4503.599999999999
certain pattern

4500.64 --> 4506.08
and there's just limits to it and in

4503.6 --> 4509.52
this case with gas pressure

4506.08 --> 4511.84
gradients it always comes

4509.52 --> 4514.2390000000005
secondary because first the gas pressure

4511.84 --> 4517.92
has to expand in all directions to fill

4514.239 --> 4519.919999999999
the available volume which is presumed

4517.92 --> 4522.0
if you're going to experiment with it

4519.92 --> 4523.28
with a vacuum

4522.0 --> 4525.04
it's just going to expand in all

4523.28 --> 4528.8
directions and after it

4525.04 --> 4529.44
it has filled it then potentially some

4528.8 --> 4533.1990000000005
gradient

4529.44 --> 4533.199
might in some ways set in

4533.44 --> 4536.639999999999
but that gradient will always be based

4535.92 --> 4540.88
on

4536.64 --> 4543.280000000001
the entire volume available volume

4540.88 --> 4545.76
and then gradiate within it with an

4543.28 --> 4545.759999999999
average

4546.32 --> 4550.88
it doesn't gradiate out into an

4548.56 --> 4553.84
asymptote

4550.88 --> 4554.159000000001
where there is a lot more gathering at

4553.84 --> 4557.52
the

4554.159 --> 4559.759999999999
at the bottom that is not how it works

4557.52 --> 4561.52
unless there is constant dynamic system

4559.76 --> 4563.4400000000005
influences

4561.52 --> 4565.120000000001
but yeah how much of that you know if

4563.44 --> 4567.678999999999
there was an infinite space then the

4565.12 --> 4569.84
dynamic influences at ground level

4567.679 --> 4571.52
it's not going to be sufficient it's not

4569.84 --> 4574.159000000001
going to be sufficient to

4571.52 --> 4577.1990000000005
prevent it all from escaping as soon as

4574.159 --> 4581.04
it is created at ground level

4577.199 --> 4585.12
can't work infinite

4581.04 --> 4587.76
volume can't have gradients because

4585.12 --> 4590.5599999999995
gas pressure can never can never settle

4587.76 --> 4593.12
because there is no container limit

4590.56 --> 4596.96
in order to reach the settling point

4593.12 --> 4596.96
after which a gradient can establish

4606.84 --> 4609.84
see

4614.32 --> 4618.96
right but things like the pressure at

4616.96 --> 4619.36
ground level and all that that can only

4618.96 --> 4622.96
work

4619.36 --> 4626.799999999999
in the first instance because

4622.96 --> 4628.96
the gas has has to already

4626.8 --> 4630.8
expanded within the available volume and

4628.96 --> 4632.64
then a gradient can set in that's how it

4630.8 --> 4634.0
works it's how you can demonstrate it

4632.64 --> 4636.719
every time because as long as the

4634.0 --> 4638.4
available volume has not been filled

4636.719 --> 4640.8
the gas will keep on rushing and

4638.4 --> 4643.839999999999
thinning up

4640.8 --> 4646.08
very very rapidly

4643.84 --> 4648.0
first the container volume has to be met

4646.08 --> 4651.199
and then

4648.0 --> 4654.4
gradient effects may start to

4651.199 --> 4659.12
transpire but if

4654.4 --> 4663.5199999999995
yeah as heliocentrism says the galaxy

4659.12 --> 4667.36
the universe is infinite volume

4663.52 --> 4667.360000000001
then that could never happen

4672.08 --> 4676.4
because it's never going to settle in

4673.679 --> 4679.84
infinite volume it has to continually

4676.4 --> 4679.839999999999
expand in all directions

4681.04 --> 4684.32
even if there's nothing left it will

4682.719 --> 4688.159
just keep on going

4684.32 --> 4691.5199999999995
very rapidly very aggressively

4688.159 --> 4695.599999999999
seemingly instantaneous but never

4691.52 --> 4698.88
reaching infinity

4695.6 --> 4702.320000000001
because it will always be expanding

4698.88 --> 4705.04
so yeah how can a gradient set in

4702.32 --> 4706.08
if everything is thinning up at a rapid

4705.04 --> 4709.44
pace constantly

4706.08 --> 4711.6
forever it can't happen

4709.44 --> 4713.678999999999
volume of the container cannot be

4711.6 --> 4717.52
infinite because then gas pressure could

4713.679 --> 4735.11
never settle in order to form a gradient

4717.52 --> 4738.17
right i hope i made that point clear now

4735.11 --> 4738.17
[Music]

4746.84 --> 4749.84
do

4774.84 --> 4777.84
so

4800.32 --> 4804.96
right yeah john mallory that's a very

4802.8 --> 4807.6
poetic thing to say

4804.96 --> 4809.92
infinite control would assimilate

4807.6 --> 4813.1990000000005
eventually to form ancient knowledge

4809.92 --> 4814.2390000000005
unknown i don't know why unknown also

4813.199 --> 4817.36
contours the

4814.239 --> 4820.799999999999
word of reality right

4817.36 --> 4822.5599999999995
that's that's what knowledge is

4820.8 --> 4825.52
now what you do with the knowledge

4822.56 --> 4825.52
that's something else

4827.84 --> 4831.1990000000005
and i explained this at the start of the

4829.679 --> 4833.84
show there's like

4831.199 --> 4835.759999999999
the typical responses to ascension to

4833.84 --> 4837.92
gaining knowledge of any sort

4835.76 --> 4840.719
getting a new depth of insight that's

4837.92 --> 4840.719
really serious

4841.199 --> 4844.879999999999
it's like attaining power and with the

4843.12 --> 4847.44
power comes challenges and those

4844.88 --> 4849.52
challenges come from within that you

4847.44 --> 4853.12
have to face

4849.52 --> 4857.360000000001
and overcome or they will become you

4853.12 --> 4859.28
as part of wielding it

4857.36 --> 4861.839999999999
serious that's how it works it's that

4859.28 --> 4861.84
mechanical

4866.159 --> 4875.839999999999
do i think god may have created earth

4868.32 --> 4875.84
like realms beyond their realm

4881.28 --> 4884.159
physical ones

4886.96 --> 4891.36
i don't know i have no reason to believe

4889.92 --> 4894.96
that

4891.36 --> 4894.96
like to really believe that

4895.44 --> 4902.159
but the earth realm the total

4898.96 --> 4904.719
confine may be bigger and

4902.159 --> 4905.36
like the singular realm we think we may

4904.719 --> 4908.56
be in

4905.36 --> 4911.12
might be split up like it might be a lot

4908.56 --> 4913.679
bigger and then compartmentalized

4911.12 --> 4914.84
but it would have all been an original

4913.679 --> 4917.84
singular

4914.84 --> 4917.84
creation

4918.08 --> 4921.36
and if there was a an absolutely

4920.239 --> 4923.599999999999
separate type of

4921.36 --> 4931.839999999999
similar creation then we would never be

4923.6 --> 4931.84
part of that

4941.28 --> 4945.36
but yes especially within looping

4944.239 --> 4948.4
systems

4945.36 --> 4950.239
if the loop can change

4948.4 --> 4952.96
that is how literally the realm

4950.239 --> 4958.5599999999995
interconnects with itself

4952.96 --> 4962.32
then potentially yeah there may be

4958.56 --> 4965.1990000000005
more realm that's simply

4962.32 --> 4966.48
hidden beyond the loop and what if the

4965.199 --> 4968.638999999999
loop just shifts

4966.48 --> 4970.839999999999
and suddenly it's like a gateway opening

4968.639 --> 4973.04
and there is an

4970.84 --> 4975.28
entire

4973.04 --> 4976.56
piece of space and whatever is in there

4975.28 --> 4980.4
that just

4976.56 --> 4980.400000000001
becomes connected now

4981.679 --> 4987.679
and that stuff the the material within

4985.92 --> 4990.719
that space it was always there

4987.679 --> 4994.0
it was simply cut off by its own loop

4990.719 --> 4997.76
right now things get really

4994.0 --> 4999.12
surreal in a way it's like portal

4997.76 --> 5003.04
dynamics but i have

4999.12 --> 5006.159
yeah within the looping realm co system

5003.04 --> 5008.56
it's it's possible

5006.159 --> 5009.599999999999
i can cons i can easily conceive of it i

5008.56 --> 5012.0
could even like build

5009.6 --> 5013.1990000000005
stories with this sort of thing i

5012.0 --> 5017.44
actually did plan

5013.199 --> 5019.599999999999
to very much so with my with my gamers

5017.44 --> 5020.48
but yeah the group kind of stopped a

5019.6 --> 5022.719
year ago

5020.48 --> 5023.839999999999
haven't heard much from them

5022.719 --> 5026.0
unfortunately

5023.84 --> 5027.360000000001
and yeah it would probably still be six

5026.0 --> 5030.4
years into the future

5027.36 --> 5032.32
before it could even actually happen but

5030.4 --> 5035.679
it has been among my

5032.32 --> 5039.5199999999995
thinking for a while

5035.679 --> 5042.08
like other other segments that are

5039.52 --> 5042.719
that are connected but are kept

5042.08 --> 5045.92
literally

5042.719 --> 5049.04
out of the loop how how ironic was that

5045.92 --> 5050.56
out of the loop it's not a loop looking

5049.04 --> 5053.76
glass kind of thing

5050.56 --> 5054.639
but literally like yeah you're going

5053.76 --> 5056.8
there

5054.639 --> 5058.32
and then oh then you arrive back over

5056.8 --> 5061.28
here and then suddenly it's like

5058.32 --> 5063.599999999999
oh you go over there and you don't

5061.28 --> 5067.679
arrive back here but suddenly there is

5063.6 --> 5071.04
more and then after you pass that more

5067.679 --> 5072.719
then you come back where you're that

5071.04 --> 5076.239
that's how it would be experienced if

5072.719 --> 5076.2390000000005
certainly a loop would open up

5077.12 --> 5080.239
a loop would expand

5081.28 --> 5088.239
what is a looping realm system well a

5084.159 --> 5090.879999999999
looping realm system is based on a

5088.239 --> 5090.879999999999
concept

5092.32 --> 5097.199
it's not a fictional medium though like

5095.52 --> 5100.88
einstein but it is the concept

5097.199 --> 5103.599999999999
that space may not be entirely linear

5100.88 --> 5105.52
and exactly that there is no absolute

5103.6 --> 5108.320000000001
euclidean reality but that

5105.52 --> 5109.6
there's simply a limited confine and it

5108.32 --> 5112.799999999999
loops in on itself

5109.6 --> 5113.76
in certain ways and the most easy to

5112.8 --> 5116.8
conceive of

5113.76 --> 5120.320000000001
would be east to west

5116.8 --> 5121.76
but it would require certain things to

5120.32 --> 5123.36
be

5121.76 --> 5125.360000000001
in order for that to even be a

5123.36 --> 5126.5599999999995
possibility for even that to be a

5125.36 --> 5129.04
conclusion

5126.56 --> 5130.88
and that is for example the equator line

5129.04 --> 5135.5199999999995
would have to be perfectly straight

5130.88 --> 5135.52
perfectly not curving

5135.84 --> 5140.56
downwards right

5138.88 --> 5142.32
and not cur because it doesn't there's

5140.56 --> 5144.0
no curvature to go down

5142.32 --> 5145.599999999999
over there's no curvature to go for

5144.0 --> 5149.92
right but not

5145.6 --> 5150.88
going in some kind of arc or circle with

5149.92 --> 5153.12
a straight line that

5150.88 --> 5154.0
that would be the easiest if you end up

5153.12 --> 5156.8
in the same place

5154.0 --> 5157.199
by going in a perfectly straight line

5156.8 --> 5160.4800000000005
then

5157.199 --> 5164.32
space is not linear it cannot be there

5160.48 --> 5164.32
is no physical explanation

5164.56 --> 5169.4400000000005
right that would be the easiest way to

5166.8 --> 5172.0
prove if space is not linear

5169.44 --> 5173.28
if that were the case because then there

5172.0 --> 5176.0
would be a

5173.28 --> 5176.48
yeah a loop a spatial loop within the

5176.0 --> 5178.32
realm and

5176.48 --> 5179.5199999999995
if there is a spatial loop in the realm

5178.32 --> 5182.94
then

5179.52 --> 5186.070000000001
how does it actually interconnect

5182.94 --> 5186.07
[Music]

5189.52 --> 5197.84
wow damn i triggered somebody over there

5217.36 --> 5225.839999999999
all right steamy traveler well i yes i

5220.08 --> 5225.84
have heard about that

5227.12 --> 5230.239
i think it's

5231.92 --> 5235.92
i think it's a belief i think that

5236.639 --> 5241.6
just thinking that we might be our own

5240.0 --> 5244.48
gods

5241.6 --> 5245.04
it doesn't really help because if we

5244.48 --> 5247.839999999999
will be

5245.04 --> 5252.159
then we will be if we won't be then we

5247.84 --> 5255.1990000000005
won't be there's nothing really

5252.159 --> 5255.199
i can do about it

5257.44 --> 5260.48
just just how this how the chain of

5259.92 --> 5262.0
events

5260.48 --> 5263.5199999999995
from a spiritual perspective would

5262.0 --> 5266.08
transpire

5263.52 --> 5267.679
so isn't it better to just focus on how

5266.08 --> 5270.32
things work over here

5267.679 --> 5271.1990000000005
while we are alive and then work on that

5270.32 --> 5275.759999999999
and then see

5271.199 --> 5278.799999999999
after death then what and they just

5275.76 --> 5281.92
maintain your spirit just don't do

5278.8 --> 5285.28
sin don't do bad things and

5281.92 --> 5295.84
yeah follow the pattern like that

5285.28 --> 5295.84
and hopefully that'll work out the best

5296.88 --> 5300.32
just try to do the right thing

5301.76 --> 5306.88
but yes they have pretty strange ideas

5304.8 --> 5309.6
that if you die

5306.88 --> 5310.08
that you will get yeah some say it like

5309.6 --> 5312.96
this

5310.08 --> 5313.44
that you get your own planet that you

5312.96 --> 5316.719
become

5313.44 --> 5316.719
god of your own planet

5317.679 --> 5323.679
that that's what they say well i

5321.12 --> 5324.4
interpreted that as okay if they believe

5323.679 --> 5328.2390000000005
in heaven

5324.4 --> 5330.879999999999
then that is their heavenly experience

5328.239 --> 5332.879999999999
that is and who knows maybe they might

5330.88 --> 5336.2390000000005
be their own gods of their own

5332.88 --> 5338.4800000000005
realm or maybe they're just experiencing

5336.239 --> 5338.48
that

5338.56 --> 5344.2390000000005
is that real does it matter to

5341.84 --> 5346.159000000001
us here on earth whether that is real or

5344.239 --> 5348.08
not right so i approached it in full

5346.159 --> 5349.92
philosophical mode

5348.08 --> 5351.199
just realized like okay they that's what

5349.92 --> 5353.52
they think

5351.199 --> 5355.5199999999995
well they're not acting like oh we're

5353.52 --> 5357.52
going to be gods

5355.52 --> 5358.719
and they're not like super eager like oh

5357.52 --> 5360.88
i want to be

5358.719 --> 5362.4800000000005
gods absolutely no they're just they

5360.88 --> 5365.52
don't want to do their best

5362.48 --> 5369.36
and they look forward to the

5365.52 --> 5372.639
to the reward that's really the effect

5369.36 --> 5373.5199999999995
that carries through with so many

5372.639 --> 5375.52
mormons

5373.52 --> 5377.1990000000005
that's what makes them so high energy

5375.52 --> 5379.84
and so good

5377.199 --> 5379.839999999999
in many ways

5381.28 --> 5385.44
but i thought that a lot of these mormon

5384.88 --> 5388.4800000000005
ideas

5385.44 --> 5388.48
are very weird

5389.12 --> 5395.36
they seem almost a bit childlike in ways

5392.32 --> 5398.719
but i don't know

5395.36 --> 5400.88
always thought in in in the end that

5398.719 --> 5404.84
mormons themselves are actually

5400.88 --> 5407.84
it's a really good culture in its own

5404.84 --> 5407.84
way

5414.159 --> 5417.28
i don't have mormon neighbors though i

5416.88 --> 5419.36
just

5417.28 --> 5421.599999999999
there's just a lot of students in this

5419.36 --> 5423.679
in this flat apartment

5421.6 --> 5426.0
there's no mormons living here as far as

5423.679 --> 5426.0
i know

5426.239 --> 5429.678999999999
but i've had plenty of the elders to

5429.199 --> 5432.239
visit

5429.679 --> 5432.96
they were all younger than me that

5432.239 --> 5435.599999999999
happened

5432.96 --> 5437.44
i've had a lot of talks a lot of looking

5435.6 --> 5437.76
into the bible and in the book of mormon

5437.44 --> 5439.759999999999
i

5437.76 --> 5443.1990000000005
have discussed it i have read the book

5439.76 --> 5443.1990000000005
of mormon for a bigger part

5445.04 --> 5451.5199999999995
the whole story about america

5449.679 --> 5454.159
and i thought it was fascinating the

5451.52 --> 5457.4400000000005
story of it so it is really

5454.159 --> 5459.759999999999
fascinating and

5457.44 --> 5462.96
interesting also from a conspiratorial

5459.76 --> 5465.280000000001
vantage point

5462.96 --> 5466.96
it's like i get the feeling there is

5465.28 --> 5471.12
something about this there's some

5466.96 --> 5473.76
not like oh i am going to surrender holy

5471.12 --> 5474.639
like that no not at all but it is very

5473.76 --> 5478.0
interesting it

5474.639 --> 5480.400000000001
almost gives it almost reveals in its

5478.0 --> 5482.639
way like

5480.4 --> 5484.48
well the obvious that history is not

5482.639 --> 5487.92
exactly what we've been told

5484.48 --> 5490.0
now it is filling that in

5487.92 --> 5491.92
and is that the proper way i don't know

5490.0 --> 5493.84
for certain i am not an expert

5491.92 --> 5496.719
at that by a long shot but what i do

5493.84 --> 5500.159000000001
know is that it opens the door

5496.719 --> 5501.84
just a little bit right in the face of

5500.159 --> 5503.92
everything and is that is really what

5501.84 --> 5507.4400000000005
christianity is all about it's about not

5503.92 --> 5511.12
cocking to government narrative

5507.44 --> 5513.759999999999
and official stuff

5511.12 --> 5514.5599999999995
about history and this is one of them

5513.76 --> 5518.4800000000005
and

5514.56 --> 5521.52
i find that very interesting

5518.48 --> 5522.0
potentially also dangerous for those

5521.52 --> 5525.4400000000005
that

5522.0 --> 5530.159
are just seeking power and mind control

5525.44 --> 5533.28
as every everything that is not purely

5530.159 --> 5535.599999999999
honest truth or

5533.28 --> 5537.36
with yeah certain absolute certainty and

5535.6 --> 5538.400000000001
there is that yeah there is just a lot

5537.36 --> 5541.04
of weirdness about

5538.4 --> 5543.04
the book of mormon how is what is

5541.04 --> 5546.159
established is just

5543.04 --> 5548.8
bizarre like

5546.159 --> 5551.199
almost meant to be just plain obvious

5548.8 --> 5554.0
like this is nonsense

5551.199 --> 5555.759999999999
but then again maybe that's not what

5554.0 --> 5558.4
it's all about maybe that's just the

5555.76 --> 5561.84
threshold to

5558.4 --> 5563.759999999999
to make you double down onto the journey

5561.84 --> 5566.88
in a way it's a mechanic

5563.76 --> 5566.88
that's how i felt it

5567.44 --> 5571.759999999999
but what i do know is that i do

5569.44 --> 5575.04
appreciate mormon people

5571.76 --> 5578.8
a lot of them that i've met really

5575.04 --> 5582.08
good heartfelt people honest

5578.8 --> 5586.08
and just very helpful great people

5582.08 --> 5589.36
but their beliefs yeah

5586.08 --> 5592.0
gets a little nutty here and there

5589.36 --> 5594.159
but at least most of them just focus on

5592.0 --> 5597.12
being good christians

5594.159 --> 5598.5599999999995
in an esoteric good way and

5597.12 --> 5601.92
unfortunately also a lot

5598.56 --> 5602.320000000001
get drown in trivialities but that's

5601.92 --> 5604.719
yeah

5602.32 --> 5607.679
a lot of people in the world that are

5604.719 --> 5607.679
christians do that

5610.56 --> 5617.120000000001
how close did i get to getting baptized

5613.52 --> 5619.52
pretty close

5617.12 --> 5620.639
i did really want to be part of this

5619.52 --> 5624.159000000001
group

5620.639 --> 5625.679
but over time that kind of eroded when i

5624.159 --> 5628.48
figured out that they had

5625.679 --> 5630.719
tendency to kind of want to break you

5628.48 --> 5633.839999999999
into their faith

5630.719 --> 5634.96
and i'm like extremely rational like

5633.84 --> 5637.04
that it's like no

5634.96 --> 5638.56
that feels like literal like a spiritual

5637.04 --> 5642.639
violation i have my

5638.56 --> 5645.84
own order i have my own thing

5642.639 --> 5645.84
and i'm eclectic

5646.32 --> 5652.4
and it's yeah touched upon many fields

5649.84 --> 5654.8
i'm like a wizard i'm a wizard i just

5652.4 --> 5655.36
i'm trying to figure it all out all of

5654.8 --> 5658.56
it

5655.36 --> 5658.96
in my own way a lot of it is spiritual

5658.56 --> 5662.96
and

5658.96 --> 5665.84
subconscious so i could not just

5662.96 --> 5666.56
convert like that i just it's just like

5665.84 --> 5670.32
the concept

5666.56 --> 5673.92
also like baptism is symbolic

5670.32 --> 5677.36
it is you can't really

5673.92 --> 5680.32
seriously ascribe like energy power

5677.36 --> 5681.759999999999
things that would truly like bless you

5680.32 --> 5686.719
and

5681.76 --> 5689.76
most of it is like a ritual

5686.719 --> 5692.639
and the psychosomatics and the focus

5689.76 --> 5694.0
and the personal dedication is what does

5692.639 --> 5697.4400000000005
it all

5694.0 --> 5698.719
that's what i learned and that's why i

5697.44 --> 5703.199
said no i'm not going

5698.719 --> 5705.92
like i am baptizing myself

5703.199 --> 5707.36
in a way it's like and i'm also

5705.92 --> 5709.84
declaring you don't need to be

5707.36 --> 5710.88
only thing that's actually needed is

5709.84 --> 5713.119000000001
walking that path

5710.88 --> 5714.0
how you do it whether you do certain

5713.119 --> 5717.04
things

5714.0 --> 5719.52
to promise to yourself or to some group

5717.04 --> 5721.44
that you're doing it if that helps you

5719.52 --> 5724.159000000001
to walk the path that's okay

5721.44 --> 5724.638999999999
but technically the only thing you need

5724.159 --> 5728.08
to do

5724.639 --> 5730.8
is just walk it and do your best to

5728.08 --> 5732.96
not stray it and if you need all kinds

5730.8 --> 5734.88
of things and rituals to do it

5732.96 --> 5736.88
that's fine as long as you realize that

5734.88 --> 5738.96
it is about walking that path

5736.88 --> 5741.6
about keeping it tight and doing your

5738.96 --> 5744.639
best and staying focused and

5741.6 --> 5747.76
not be seduced by the darkness that will

5744.639 --> 5752.56
as you ascend rise within you to meet

5747.76 --> 5757.84
it and to stay stave you off

5752.56 --> 5757.84
from reaching peak energy

5762.4 --> 5771.839999999999
bless the magic underwear yeah

5772.719 --> 5776.88
i i've seen sillier things though in

5775.6 --> 5779.280000000001
religions

5776.88 --> 5779.28
you know

5782.96 --> 5786.08
but yeah the underwear thing it is a

5784.88 --> 5789.119
little esoteric

5786.08 --> 5789.119
it is a little weird

5796.239 --> 5800.08
what's the magic under what you didn't

5797.76 --> 5802.719
know it's like when you get baptized you

5800.08 --> 5805.36
have to wear special clothing

5802.719 --> 5807.44
it's like a special set of clothes

5805.36 --> 5810.839999999999
special underwear

5807.44 --> 5813.839999999999
to get into the water with and then yeah

5810.84 --> 5813.84
that

5814.88 --> 5827.84
that's what it is

5834.239 --> 5838.159
what's special about it well the special

5836.48 --> 5841.44
thing about it is that it is

5838.159 --> 5844.239
specially made for that that's what's

5841.44 --> 5844.239
special about it

5845.52 --> 5850.0
and that it is the it's like a ritual

5849.119 --> 5853.199
garment

5850.0 --> 5854.239
thing it's just it's funny to just call

5853.199 --> 5856.4
it underwear

5854.239 --> 5857.839999999999
magic underwear but it supposedly also

5856.4 --> 5861.679
takes on the blessing

5857.84 --> 5865.52
but there's a lot of exoteric things

5861.679 --> 5868.2390000000005
with energies and blessings

5865.52 --> 5868.88
that goes around in mormon culture like

5868.239 --> 5871.04
that

5868.88 --> 5872.2390000000005
it's a lot of exoteric approaches and

5871.04 --> 5876.159
it's like okay this is

5872.239 --> 5879.199
something that is specially blessed for

5876.159 --> 5881.44
by christ or by all that

5879.199 --> 5883.678999999999
and then you keep it like a magic item

5881.44 --> 5886.159
in a way now the funny thing is i really

5883.679 --> 5889.36
appreciate that concept

5886.159 --> 5892.32
it's just that it

5889.36 --> 5892.32
is a little weird

5892.8 --> 5900.320000000001
i am very much about blessed items

5897.28 --> 5904.5599999999995
worn once no i've never worn

5900.32 --> 5907.04
magic underwear i never got baptized

5904.56 --> 5908.8
i had seen it though i because i almost

5907.04 --> 5912.159
did they did show me like

5908.8 --> 5914.2390000000005
this is the magic underwear do you want

5912.159 --> 5914.5599999999995
it now because i was like almost ready

5914.239 --> 5918.0
to

5914.56 --> 5920.719
to do it and then then i stopped

5918.0 --> 5922.639
then i didn't do it because it felt off

5920.719 --> 5924.96
i felt there was like this weird

5922.639 --> 5926.639
forced rush it was creepy anyways like

5924.96 --> 5929.44
something subconscious was going on and

5926.639 --> 5929.4400000000005
i didn't like it

5929.84 --> 5932.88
again as i said they get kind of pushy

5932.159 --> 5936.799999999999
to want you

5932.88 --> 5939.1990000000005
in and that in a way creeped me out

5936.8 --> 5940.56
for people that are just really nice and

5939.199 --> 5943.28
good it's like

5940.56 --> 5944.56
a part of it that i didn't feel entirely

5943.28 --> 5947.84
comfortable with and

5944.56 --> 5948.4800000000005
almost cultish it's part of what they do

5947.84 --> 5950.32
it's

5948.48 --> 5952.0
part of it all it's just like they want

5950.32 --> 5955.199
more people

5952.0 --> 5955.199
that will be part of them

5956.4 --> 5962.0
and it is a really nice and warm

5959.679 --> 5964.88
helpful group to be a part of so i

5962.0 --> 5968.56
totally get that

5964.88 --> 5970.88
but also once you basically enter

5968.56 --> 5971.679
yeah they're going to just get in your

5970.88 --> 5974.88
face a lot

5971.679 --> 5977.4400000000005
in a good way unfortunately i'm a very

5974.88 --> 5979.679
solitary kind of guy now i'm solitary

5977.44 --> 5983.04
enough to eventually end up like

5979.679 --> 5986.32
i'm always so alone yeah no [ __ ] dude

5983.04 --> 5989.92
that's because i'm

5986.32 --> 5990.239
just not very sociable right but then if

5989.92 --> 5993.04
i

5990.239 --> 5996.159
would do that i would get really sick of

5993.04 --> 6000.8
it i'm not solitary

5996.159 --> 6000.799999999999
it's i just don't have a

6001.04 --> 6005.5199999999995
a lot socializing that i can take i have

6004.159 --> 6008.32
to like get a breather

6005.52 --> 6010.4800000000005
relatively quickly my battery is full

6008.32 --> 6012.48
relatively quickly on the social skills

6010.48 --> 6013.36
if i had people nagging on me all the

6012.48 --> 6015.28
time

6013.36 --> 6017.119
that i could not absolutely shut off

6015.28 --> 6018.239
like on the computer on the internet i

6017.119 --> 6022.0
can literally just

6018.239 --> 6024.159
turn it off and then nobody bothers me

6022.0 --> 6025.84
right i can do that well if there's all

6024.159 --> 6027.679
constantly people around you you can't

6025.84 --> 6030.08
do that

6027.679 --> 6031.6
right it's also one of the reasons i

6030.08 --> 6033.6
didn't really want to be a part of it

6031.6 --> 6035.360000000001
because that i knew they were going to

6033.6 --> 6038.320000000001
object to my personal

6035.36 --> 6038.32
explorations

6039.04 --> 6042.239
and they would be telling me no you have

6040.719 --> 6043.52
to read the book you have to read the

6042.239 --> 6045.678999999999
book a lot

6043.52 --> 6047.76
that got kind of annoying i got very

6045.679 --> 6048.88
good at explaining to them in a very

6047.76 --> 6051.52
interesting way

6048.88 --> 6055.119
why i did and what i was doing how i was

6051.52 --> 6056.96
being an esoteric christian

6055.119 --> 6059.119
and then i would leave it to them like

6056.96 --> 6060.159
you can bring up something

6059.119 --> 6061.92
is there something that you're

6060.159 --> 6063.28
interested maybe i can tell you

6061.92 --> 6066.639
something about that through

6063.28 --> 6068.48
my spectacle through the way i

6066.639 --> 6070.2390000000005
explain and see things and we did that a

6068.48 --> 6071.599999999999
lot that did that a lot with elders when

6070.239 --> 6073.04
they came to visit it was very

6071.6 --> 6074.96
interesting it was amusing and

6073.04 --> 6076.4
they would hang around for a very long

6074.96 --> 6077.92
time

6076.4 --> 6080.4
and then it'd be like oh [ __ ] we

6077.92 --> 6081.52
actually we were supposed to be there

6080.4 --> 6084.08
and there

6081.52 --> 6086.080000000001
because we had great conversations in

6084.08 --> 6088.719
that setup where i was free

6086.08 --> 6089.44
where it was free was not forced to do

6088.719 --> 6092.56
it

6089.44 --> 6094.4
it's just a two-way communication with

6092.56 --> 6097.6
energy

6094.4 --> 6100.96
understanding it was good

6097.6 --> 6103.76
so yeah i am happy

6100.96 --> 6105.76
about meeting the mormons and about my

6103.76 --> 6121.84
time with them

6105.76 --> 6124.96
but i am not a mormon like that i am not

6121.84 --> 6128.0
yeah in the rhyme rhythm

6124.96 --> 6131.52
right but the mormons have not been

6128.0 --> 6134.639
anything like say jehovah's witness

6131.52 --> 6137.76
because they are like really

6134.639 --> 6140.2390000000005
cultish they are as mechanically cultish

6137.76 --> 6142.56
right mormons are not like that at all

6140.239 --> 6145.759999999999
they absolutely are very like

6142.56 --> 6148.4800000000005
liberal in their own unique way

6145.76 --> 6149.04
or they really respect people's personal

6148.48 --> 6151.678999999999
struggle

6149.04 --> 6153.84
and freedom and choices they just want

6151.679 --> 6154.08
to help them prevent making mistakes and

6153.84 --> 6157.28
i

6154.08 --> 6161.679
really appreciate that i read

6157.28 --> 6165.36
i learned from that from that attitude

6161.679 --> 6167.84
i it's what in i'm trying to do in my

6165.36 --> 6171.679
own way to

6167.84 --> 6173.6
help people to prevent them from

6171.679 --> 6176.08
stumbling down

6173.6 --> 6178.0
making mistakes it could be very angry

6176.08 --> 6181.28
at them for like you're making a stupid

6178.0 --> 6183.52
mistake what are you doing you idiot

6181.28 --> 6185.92
might in certain moments be called for

6183.52 --> 6189.6
to do that in other moments

6185.92 --> 6191.6
just need to try to give the tell them

6189.6 --> 6195.280000000001
like now this is not good

6191.6 --> 6197.52
i wouldn't do it i wouldn't do it

6195.28 --> 6199.599999999999
and then if they still do it then at

6197.52 --> 6202.080000000001
least they know that i try to warn them

6199.6 --> 6204.56
and eventually they'll get to a point

6202.08 --> 6205.119
where they will actually start to listen

6204.56 --> 6207.679
because

6205.119 --> 6208.799999999999
they have reflected upon what i said

6207.679 --> 6211.52
what happened and then

6208.8 --> 6212.719
hopefully concluded like yeah yeah it

6211.52 --> 6215.040000000001
was kind of right

6212.719 --> 6216.84
maybe i should pay a bit more attention

6215.04 --> 6221.119
next time

6216.84 --> 6224.0
right so yeah again i got a lot

6221.119 --> 6225.44
out of my time with the mormons it was a

6224.0 --> 6230.719
spiritual study it was

6225.44 --> 6230.719
like bible school that i did myself

6230.88 --> 6234.0
and not like oh i'm going to study the

6232.4 --> 6237.119
bible but just thinking

6234.0 --> 6240.159
a lot about it and about what is it

6237.119 --> 6242.4
how do they do things

6240.159 --> 6244.839999999999
what is their outlook in life how do

6242.4 --> 6247.5199999999995
they respond to things like news

6244.84 --> 6249.360000000001
fascinating because a lot of them were

6247.52 --> 6251.1990000000005
in their own ways kind of gullible

6249.36 --> 6253.36
but they have their own control

6251.199 --> 6256.5599999999995
mechanisms to prevent you from being

6253.36 --> 6260.88
dragged down and carried away

6256.56 --> 6263.76
by things in the news

6260.88 --> 6263.76
it's fascinating

6264.159 --> 6266.48
all right

6267.92 --> 6272.08
gaining wisdom in my chat yesterday i

6270.08 --> 6273.76
think it was sock perhaps anyway

6272.08 --> 6275.199
no it was actually the real gaining

6273.76 --> 6280.56
wisdom it

6275.199 --> 6283.44
i don't know maybe it was weird

6280.56 --> 6285.6
looked for his wrench i don't know no

6283.44 --> 6289.44
wait

6285.6 --> 6292.2390000000005
uh yeah i gave him a wrench that's right

6289.44 --> 6294.879999999999
i gave you a wrench just to be sure that

6292.239 --> 6294.879999999999
it is you

6299.28 --> 6304.4
because you said some things in my chat

6301.52 --> 6305.92
yesterday that were a little bit weird

6304.4 --> 6307.599999999999
though gaining wisdom i don't even

6305.92 --> 6308.0
remember what it was i just remembered

6307.6 --> 6317.4400000000005
that

6308.0 --> 6319.679
it was seemed a bit weird

6317.44 --> 6320.799999999999
all right oh by the way again about

6319.679 --> 6324.08
mormons

6320.8 --> 6327.52
one thing that i really appreciated it

6324.08 --> 6327.92
really did is that they had a similar

6327.52 --> 6331.76
thing

6327.92 --> 6335.04
as to what my parents did

6331.76 --> 6338.56
in our home and that is active

6335.04 --> 6341.44
family time a lot of it um

6338.56 --> 6344.159000000001
giving that attention being active

6341.44 --> 6347.199
really trying to build things together

6344.159 --> 6349.599999999999
like a team well i did that with my

6347.199 --> 6351.599999999999
parents intellectually it saved me it

6349.6 --> 6355.84
saved me from probably

6351.6 --> 6358.400000000001
becoming extremely miserable in life

6355.84 --> 6359.679
not that it entirely prevented it wasn't

6358.4 --> 6363.28
without his faults but

6359.679 --> 6367.119
that it was great to have that

6363.28 --> 6370.239
and mormons do that always

6367.119 --> 6371.679
have a lot of active family time really

6370.239 --> 6373.44
serious

6371.679 --> 6374.88
not like oh you have to be there no

6373.44 --> 6378.4
everybody pays attention

6374.88 --> 6381.6
and it oh loved it

6378.4 --> 6385.44
beautiful i've yeah

6381.6 --> 6388.2390000000005
visited some mormon guy

6385.44 --> 6388.48
yeah families got to know a couple of

6388.239 --> 6392.879999999999
them

6388.48 --> 6395.5199999999995
a little and it's just really good to be

6392.88 --> 6397.119
to be with them during those kinds of

6395.52 --> 6399.360000000001
things

6397.119 --> 6400.4
but not constantly though you know

6399.36 --> 6405.199
eventually i got

6400.4 --> 6407.28
like yeah i need more solitary time

6405.199 --> 6409.199
but when i did it it was really good and

6407.28 --> 6409.84
it was very learnful i learned a lot

6409.199 --> 6412.879999999999
about it

6409.84 --> 6416.88
and so did they because they do learn

6412.88 --> 6418.719
they do they are curious they try to

6416.88 --> 6420.08
improve themselves a lot of the people

6418.719 --> 6422.88
actively and there are some

6420.08 --> 6424.5599999999995
really smart mormons that are also in

6422.88 --> 6428.159000000001
their own way

6424.56 --> 6431.52
yeah trying to reach out and assimilate

6428.159 --> 6434.239
valuable insights that might

6431.52 --> 6435.280000000001
be robbing certain family members wrong

6434.239 --> 6437.119
or whatever they're

6435.28 --> 6439.119
there are some really curious moments

6437.119 --> 6443.199
too you know

6439.119 --> 6446.159
they just try not to

6443.199 --> 6447.04
not to rub wrong people the wrong way

6446.159 --> 6450.4
but anyway

6447.04 --> 6455.119
yeah do you know any personals

6450.4 --> 6457.44
i i don't know any jehovah's

6455.119 --> 6458.48
have met some jehovah's that they i let

6457.44 --> 6460.5599999999995
them in

6458.48 --> 6471.839999999999
and discuss them to test them test their

6460.56 --> 6471.84
knowledge test their responses

6482.84 --> 6485.84
right

6511.17 --> 6516.2390000000005
[Music]

6519.78 --> 6527.84
[Music]

6524.84 --> 6527.84
um

6532.08 --> 6536.639
yeah but see me traveler look i said

6534.56 --> 6538.320000000001
that on purpose

6536.639 --> 6540.32
in a way they believe they get their own

6538.32 --> 6543.36
planets it's

6540.32 --> 6545.84
the mormons don't really have any fixed

6543.36 --> 6547.199
ideas about the shape of the earth it

6545.84 --> 6551.28
doesn't focus on that at

6547.199 --> 6555.36
all and so some conceive it to be as

6551.28 --> 6560.0
planets it's basically their own world

6555.36 --> 6560.0
their their own reality

6560.159 --> 6563.839999999999
that's yeah that is kind of like how it

6563.28 --> 6566.88
is

6563.84 --> 6569.360000000001
laid out and yeah some people then put

6566.88 --> 6572.719
the word planet on top of that because

6569.36 --> 6572.719
there is just ballers

6573.119 --> 6579.598999999999
people that that have just assimilated

6576.199 --> 6579.598999999999
heliocentrism in there

6580.159 --> 6583.759999999999
it happened in this one as well or were

6582.48 --> 6585.759999999999
these moments where like

6583.76 --> 6587.04
the main guy what's it called again i

6585.76 --> 6588.88
don't know

6587.04 --> 6590.239
who would just start talking about

6588.88 --> 6592.0
freaking planets and [ __ ]

6590.239 --> 6593.759999999999
and i rose up against that it's like

6592.0 --> 6595.36
this is

6593.76 --> 6597.76
don't you know the bible says the earth

6595.36 --> 6600.639
is flat and then he got a very angry

6597.76 --> 6600.639
face for a second

6601.76 --> 6606.320000000001
yeah that was a really big

6604.8 --> 6608.2390000000005
disappointment i had

6606.32 --> 6610.799999999999
had at the time kind of hoped that i

6608.239 --> 6614.08
could wake up a bishop right right

6610.8 --> 6617.28
i had kind of hoped that i could wake up

6614.08 --> 6620.159
everybody to flatter like open up to it

6617.28 --> 6622.0
but it didn't really work out i did

6620.159 --> 6624.32
reveal it to some

6622.0 --> 6626.48
that we're very open-minded about it

6624.32 --> 6630.239
they were like wow that is

6626.48 --> 6633.28
that is puzzling

6630.239 --> 6636.5599999999995
like it revealed to them like

6633.28 --> 6637.199
there is something wrong like in a way

6636.56 --> 6639.360000000001
like

6637.199 --> 6642.159
they felt like ah it almost feels like

6639.36 --> 6644.4
the matrix or something

6642.159 --> 6653.839999999999
it's like it's not what it seems

6644.4 --> 6653.839999999999
everybody still reinforces it

6664.08 --> 6668.32
okay in the rhyme in the rhythm sure

6674.32 --> 6681.84
x was a mormon

6689.599 --> 6694.2390000000005
oh there was a girl over there well as

6692.84 --> 6697.28
well this is

6694.239 --> 6699.36
i kind of but she got married to

6697.28 --> 6704.0
somebody else in freaking brazil

6699.36 --> 6705.839999999999
ark my god was she beautiful

6704.0 --> 6707.199
like i was ready to step up there and

6705.84 --> 6711.599
like

6707.199 --> 6711.598999999999
go for it but

6713.04 --> 6720.159
and it's back internet failure

6716.56 --> 6722.2390000000005
i was there just in time to fix it

6720.159 --> 6724.5599999999995
but yeah i was gonna round out my show

6722.239 --> 6724.5599999999995
anyway

6725.28 --> 6729.119
so yeah it's been interesting

6727.119 --> 6732.4
conversations today was good to

6729.119 --> 6732.4
talk about mormons again

6732.8 --> 6737.84
