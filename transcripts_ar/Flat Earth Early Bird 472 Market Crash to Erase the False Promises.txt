[Music]

31.86 --> 33.92
you

36.96 --> 44.410000000000004
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.93 --> 46.03

62.559 --> 70.11
won't be much appreciated what is that

70.41 --> 81.61
all right yeah the weather today is

76.53 --> 84.07000000000001
beautiful sword oh yeah there's also

81.61 --> 91.02
still some clouds out there but it's

84.07 --> 91.02
been quite beautiful and pleasant so far

92.19 --> 99.85
not too windy nice and sunny still bit

96.49 --> 103.899
fresh though but yeah it's just air

99.85 --> 106.70899999999999
seems very clear much better than

103.899 --> 109.479
yesterday yeah yesterday was a bit of a

106.709 --> 114.099
weird day for me well them was blatantly

109.479 --> 121.42
obvious I had sort of a hangover not so

114.099 --> 124.259
today I feel so much better I did go to

121.42 --> 127.42
bed pretty early again but this time

124.259 --> 130.72
yeah I did actually have a good night's

127.42 --> 134.14000000000001
sleep and felt a lot better in the

130.72 --> 139.18
morning even though yesterday a lot of

134.14 --> 141.099
the day I was just just my mind seemed

139.18 --> 143.11
like spiraling all the time I was very

141.099 --> 146.01999999999998
annoying and probably you guys could

143.11 --> 148.09
tell on the show that it was like

146.02 --> 152.739
incredibly worried about things that are

148.09 --> 154.39000000000001
just I wasn't even sure or I couldn't

152.739 --> 159.56900000000002
make out whether that is real or not

154.39 --> 159.569
it's yeah this my inner complexities

162.1 --> 168.07999999999998
yeah I noticed their check oh I didn't

165.92 --> 169.45999999999998
see what the issue was but yeah I'm

168.08 --> 172.91000000000003
starting a little bit quick today

169.46 --> 176.3
because apparently so I hear from lots

172.91 --> 179.09
of people in chat the the time has

176.3 --> 181.61
shifted for them in our forward so to

179.09 --> 184.43
them I seem kind of late well I think

181.61 --> 187.10000000000002
that this shift basically already

184.43 --> 189.95000000000002
happened here in Europe a while ago I

187.1 --> 192.13
think so or we're gonna be later because

189.95 --> 198.07999999999998
nothing has changed on the clocks here

192.13 --> 200.18
that I've noticed so anyway I'm starting

198.08 --> 203.57000000000002
a bit early you know why not I have been

200.18 --> 209.78
starting late for two weeks I'll end so

203.57 --> 211.76
why not I kind of wanted to start even I

209.78 --> 213.11
thought I Ritchie like why not start an

211.76 --> 216.42999999999998
hour early but then I thought yeah I

213.11 --> 216.43
have to actually fill it all up

223.15 --> 230.65
all right well George Sanford you know

225.879 --> 233.14
we do go we do live by the clocks or a

230.65 --> 235.69
lot of people and that kind of goes on

233.14 --> 238.42
so if the time changes you can just say

235.69 --> 240.519
here I'm not gonna adapt well that's

238.42 --> 241.98
fine but the rest of the world will and

240.519 --> 245.84900000000002
they will find it confusing if you don't

241.98 --> 245.849
so yeah

251.72 --> 259.23
[Music]

254.3 --> 264.12
pharming right anyway um yeah yeah of

259.23 --> 266.85
course I got green tea with me DND did

264.12 --> 269.25
not go ahead yesterday it was a very big

266.85 --> 271.77000000000004
disappointment I was like getting ready

269.25 --> 275.1
I felt kind of shitty still but I was

271.77 --> 277.68
like okay well D&D at least will get my

275.1 --> 279.15000000000003
mind off things completely it always I

277.68 --> 280.95
really get envelopes so it doesn't

279.15 --> 282.41999999999996
really matter if I feel kind of bad or

280.95 --> 284.94
even paranoid

282.42 --> 286.95
I get so infallibly in that that I just

284.94 --> 289.38
don't have the time to get distracted by

286.95 --> 292.72999999999996
the back of my mind it's very

289.38 --> 295.26
therapeutic but it didn't continue

292.73 --> 298.23
because one of the guys got sick

295.26 --> 301.98
apparently not after coronavirus don't

298.23 --> 305.76
worry just a cold or whatever and yeah

301.98 --> 307.95000000000005
so it was being postponed probably next

305.76 --> 312.24
week maybe the week after yeah this

307.95 --> 315.51
usually happens so I say like we plan

312.24 --> 318.84000000000003
officially every two weeks usually comes

315.51 --> 320.78999999999996
down to every month or sometimes one and

318.84 --> 322.67999999999995
a half up to two months postponing it

320.79 --> 325.47
just happens it's kind of annoying but

322.68 --> 328.86
it's nothing I can do about it they all

325.47 --> 331.65000000000003
have their own work schedules and their

328.86 --> 335.84000000000003
own periods of sickness and all that and

331.65 --> 335.84
yeah it happens

336.5 --> 343.5
did I see quantum of conscious not I

340.05 --> 345.27000000000004
haven't seen this most recent video I

343.5 --> 348.6
haven't look I went to bed pretty early

345.27 --> 351.0
and I felt kind of like a nerf so I

348.6 --> 354.87
haven't really dug into things a lot

351.0 --> 357.81
yesterday if there was any Owen Benjamin

354.87 --> 360.63
I completely missed out on it what I did

357.81 --> 364.08
do instead was kind of go on the 24/7

360.63 --> 366.51
discord Flat Earth Channel and talk

364.08 --> 368.21999999999997
there pretty long I think I was on there

366.51 --> 370.8
for like it active for at least two

368.22 --> 372.45000000000005
hours chocolate also came on there and

370.8 --> 375.78000000000003
it was fun we talked about a lot of

372.45 --> 377.25
different things including the corona

375.78 --> 379.88
what I thought about it because somebody

377.25 --> 379.88
asked and

380.47 --> 390.31
yeah but other than that I pretty much

385.37 --> 393.98
laid back yesterday just recovering and

390.31 --> 395.93
also I think I tested it again because I

393.98 --> 398.36
still had some of the dinner left I

395.93 --> 401.18
still do now but it really does seem

398.36 --> 404.39
like the the huge impact we had more to

401.18 --> 408.5
do with the heaviness of the food that I

404.39 --> 411.89
made because apparently I I think I

408.5 --> 414.44
added a lot of olive oil to it and even

411.89 --> 418.84999999999997
though it is vegetarian and all it just

414.44 --> 421.76
seems yeah I did pull full just put all

418.85 --> 423.65000000000003
the liquids in it all of it I usually do

421.76 --> 427.84999999999997
that you know so it becomes kind of a

423.65 --> 430.37
chilly come that thick soup I really

427.85 --> 433.04
like it like that and it is healthy but

430.37 --> 435.83
man the impact it's making is kind of

433.04 --> 439.88
big and even though it's just that I had

435.83 --> 443.35999999999996
two bears yesterday only and even with

439.88 --> 445.58
those it just felt like with the Chilean

443.36 --> 447.62
air just like oh man it's really the

445.58 --> 451.09999999999997
chili it just makes so much impact on me

447.62 --> 455.21
for some reason so it's pretty heavy

451.1 --> 457.61
food I'm gonna have to take smaller

455.21 --> 461.15
portions of it every time I make it like

457.61 --> 464.87
this and then just I don't know eat some

461.15 --> 465.44
other snacks on the side that are a

464.87 --> 469.82
little lighter

465.44 --> 470.71
anyway black food update I'm doing

469.82 --> 473.59999999999997
pretty good

470.71 --> 478.78999999999996
if you're less stressed out the Morning

473.6 --> 480.83000000000004
Sun also help yeah something that really

478.79 --> 485.15000000000003
caught my attention today before I

480.83 --> 487.7
started to show was a duck I usually go

485.15 --> 491.33
to Artie because they have a wide

487.7 --> 494.51
variety subjects that they have very

491.33 --> 496.58
easily presented like it's easy to

494.51 --> 500.36
explore the Artie site I think I think

496.58 --> 503.31899999999996
they did a good job even though yeah

500.36 --> 505.99
there there is some propaganda in there

503.319 --> 511.569
yeah it's tough to tell because it is of

505.99 --> 513.969
course a bigger outlet but yeah it I

511.569 --> 518.1990000000001
something I know this big time was just

513.969 --> 527.5
all the crazy crazy economic articles

518.199 --> 531.069
like what so it seems like like

527.5 --> 534.36
everything every single thing everything

531.069 --> 537.069
that is up there financially is plunging

534.36 --> 539.29
like simultaneously it's almost like a

537.069 --> 543.81
financial controlled demolition where it

539.29 --> 543.81
just all blows up suddenly it's crazy

545.339 --> 555.009
so the weirdest part was that even oil

549.24 --> 556.72
seems to be crashing and Bitcoin it's an

555.009 --> 559.509
incredible plunge now of course the

556.72 --> 562.269
stock market so it seems like it's just

559.509 --> 564.49
the universal crack down there they're

562.269 --> 566.86
cracking down on all the long-term

564.49 --> 568.51
financial promises that have been

566.86 --> 570.4300000000001
growing everywhere people have been

568.51 --> 573.85
investing they're like oh yeah I'm gonna

570.43 --> 575.949
go for that big price but apparently

573.85 --> 578.529
it's too much because everything has

575.949 --> 582.7199999999999
gotten a huge hit so it's almost like

578.529 --> 587.23
yeah you can't really escape from this

582.72 --> 591.089
and yeah that's not gonna sit well with

587.23 --> 591.089
a huge amount of people

595.49 --> 605.389
so that that just stood out to me let's

599.97 --> 605.389
see if I can present some of it maybe

616.439 --> 621.699
it's just

618.92 --> 621.699
come on

624.37 --> 629.73
right that's more like it all right so

627.7 --> 638.44
this one

629.73 --> 643.12
what's going on with stocks and oil oil

638.44 --> 651.73
prices crest as as much as 30% that boom

643.12 --> 653.65
on the Monday apparently Brent was the

651.73 --> 660.0
biggest one yeah the biggest drop since

653.65 --> 660.0
the Gulf War in 1991 so it's massive

660.779 --> 665.98
right so this is just very extensive

663.58 --> 672.0600000000001
news I'm not even into all that but it

665.98 --> 678.16
is a pretty big thing so that's one

672.06 --> 680.9499999999999
right right so they in this article it's

678.16 --> 682.93
attributed to the while the pricing wars

680.95 --> 684.85
between our Saudi Arabia and Russia

682.93 --> 687.67
because yeah Saudi Arabia is of course

684.85 --> 691.48
they one of the prime players of oil in

687.67 --> 692.8299999999999
the world and Russia is competing and

691.48 --> 695.6800000000001
one of the strategies that they've used

692.83 --> 699.779
to compete is basically just I have a

695.68 --> 702.8199999999999
huge amount of it vastly expand their

699.779 --> 705.1899999999999
their mining industry in these things

702.82 --> 708.0400000000001
especially gas they had a huge project

705.19 --> 712.9590000000001
for it's very it's awesome I think it's

708.04 --> 717.8499999999999
really brilliant what they've done in my

712.959 --> 721.9799999999999
humble opinion but yeah they they made

717.85 --> 724.63
they basically produce cheap stuff and

721.98 --> 727.87
it seems like Saudi Arabia is trying to

724.63 --> 729.01
kind of make a yeah there they want to

727.87 --> 732.54
exploit they want to make everything

729.01 --> 737.709
expensive Russia is not really helping

732.54 --> 739.4499999999999
just like they're just gonna do cheap so

737.709 --> 746.02
that's kind of causing a little chaos

739.45 --> 750.4000000000001
and of course the Bitcoin yeah the

746.02 --> 752.53
coronavirus is just a general like more

750.4 --> 755.1999999999999
the grassroots economy just the motion

752.53 --> 757.72
of people the general trade the

755.2 --> 758.259
expenditures that is really what the

757.72 --> 760.6600000000001
corona

758.259 --> 762.759
phears have hit the most so that makes

760.66 --> 765.009
it's like a layer on top of everything

762.759 --> 770.889
or for everything else it's pretty much

765.009 --> 775.66
as good as economic chaos only not total

770.889 --> 785.41
chaos but it is pretty crazy out there

775.66 --> 787.4789999999999
so Bitcoin plunged 10% bomb yeah it

785.41 --> 792.189
started apparently after Saturday and

787.479 --> 795.8190000000001
yeah in Monday little rebound but still

792.189 --> 799.509
they lost 10% in a day that's kind of

795.819 --> 801.0999999999999
telly and now on the other hand and what

799.509 --> 803.019
is also interesting about it is of

801.1 --> 806.859
course Bitcoin is one of the primaries

803.019 --> 809.679
it's like it's the peak on top that

806.859 --> 811.989
touches upon the real money it is B it

809.679 --> 814.779
is the real thing that's being accepted

811.989 --> 817.869
as virtual money it's being being taken

814.779 --> 820.509
seriously and that means that that is

817.869 --> 823.6890000000001
kind of the way in for cryptocurrencies

820.509 --> 825.97
into the actual finances that are under

823.689 --> 827.799
control by bankers and all that and they

825.97 --> 831.1890000000001
allow it that's what I've been trying to

827.799 --> 833.169
tell people so if it is gonna plunge the

831.189 --> 835.569
funny thing about it is yeah that seems

833.169 --> 838.149
like a huge malice like oh my god

835.569 --> 843.819
cryptocurrency is dead well not really

838.149 --> 846.699
though in a way it is because Trust goes

843.819 --> 848.5889999999999
down a little because of the plunge that

846.699 --> 850.289
that's not good for anyone's confidence

848.589 --> 853.0290000000001
especially this is that quickly but

850.289 --> 857.529
there's so many cryptocurrencies

853.029 --> 859.509
other than Bitcoin and they actually

857.529 --> 861.309
have a little advantage because of that

859.509 --> 862.629
because if it's of a Bitcoin suddenly

861.309 --> 864.459
plunges that means that the

862.629 --> 867.4590000000001
cryptocurrencies other than could

864.459 --> 870.6089999999999
Bitcoin suddenly in relation to it well

867.459 --> 875.5889999999999
they go up in value 9 percent so sadly

870.609 --> 880.239
that makes it cheaper to buy Bitcoin so

875.589 --> 883.2890000000001
see the the cryptocurrency market is

880.239 --> 887.3190000000001
very fast and misunderstood and dynamic

883.289 --> 891.22
so even though crypto like even though

887.319 --> 892.12
Bitcoin plunges you know that that still

891.22 --> 895.24
doesn't mean that

892.12 --> 900.189
it's all den but since it is kind of the

895.24 --> 904.089
the cornerstone that forms the entry to

900.189 --> 908.62
the real finances that it is kind of

904.089 --> 911.47
unnerving but so yeah that is my my

908.62 --> 913.899
personal are we nian forecast

911.47 --> 915.399
financially as to some of the things

913.899 --> 921.6
that caught my attention today

915.399 --> 921.6
I hope you appreciate the presentation

928.88 --> 936.05
right stick it sick Nash virus closing

934.1 --> 938.9300000000001
quarantines massive impacted group

936.05 --> 940.49
global trade right it's suddenly like

938.93 --> 942.949
things are shutting down it's even

940.49 --> 946.2090000000001
almost demonstratively it seems like

942.949 --> 949.389
it's just things are being canceled

946.209 --> 952.0999999999999
sports events even are being canceled

949.389 --> 954.529
supposedly because of the fear of

952.1 --> 956.48
spreading the corona virus because a lot

954.529 --> 959.149
of these things are international you

956.48 --> 961.61
know so in a way that makes sense it's

959.149 --> 963.38
like okay if you're really gonna take

961.61 --> 965.42
some kinda shredding seriously and like

963.38 --> 967.819
it's super dangerous then just moving

965.42 --> 970.639
around is kind of especially

967.819 --> 973.069
internationally yeah that poses a higher

970.639 --> 977.649
risk than just I don't know going out in

973.069 --> 982.579
your city day-to-day life or the country

977.649 --> 985.55
so but yeah it is as I said at the start

982.579 --> 987.8599999999999
of it when I first started to speak out

985.55 --> 991.899
about my opinions concerning the corona

987.86 --> 995.509
situation and that is yeah I don't think

991.899 --> 998.959
it is what they say it is I don't think

995.509 --> 1002.79
viruses really are even what is what we

998.959 --> 1007.0889999999999
are taught they are but the fear and the

1002.79 --> 1009.779
financial effect of that is very real

1007.089 --> 1013.509
and we are in the middle of it

1009.779 --> 1016.029
everybody's in the middle of it and yeah

1013.509 --> 1020.47
the results are already very very

1016.029 --> 1027.73
tangible for everyone so yeah what do we

1020.47 --> 1029.89
do what do we do with all this the only

1027.73 --> 1034.089
thing that I can think of that to do is

1029.89 --> 1037.7800000000002
just try to keep it calm de-centralized

1034.089 --> 1040.329
it's a universal tip because this is

1037.78 --> 1043.53
typically such a seiche type of

1040.329 --> 1046.8999999999999
situation that comes forth from

1043.53 --> 1049.6789999999999
monolithic power situations it always

1046.9 --> 1049.679
does that

1051.18 --> 1057.93
if the biggest system is in the hands of

1054.96 --> 1059.64
a group of people then they will do this

1057.93 --> 1063.0900000000001
they will give moments where just

1059.64 --> 1065.6100000000001
everything seems great and then they

1063.09 --> 1067.9499999999998
can't hold it up anymore because there's

1065.61 --> 1070.59
too many promises that are being created

1067.95 --> 1072.48
that can be fulfilled in the process you

1070.59 --> 1074.55
know people are chasing their dreams

1072.48 --> 1076.44
when everything is good it doesn't

1074.55 --> 1078.06
always have to be real in the end that's

1076.44 --> 1081.63
the thing that's the part of the trick

1078.06 --> 1085.44
of the bankers and humanity in general

1081.63 --> 1088.0200000000002
it's crazy how that works but yeah they

1085.44 --> 1089.8500000000001
can always hold up their end in the end

1088.02 --> 1093.75
so when suddenly people are like hey I

1089.85 --> 1095.07
want to cash in now and too many people

1093.75 --> 1097.11
do that at the same time it's

1095.07 --> 1100.1299999999999
effectively just like a bank run it's

1097.11 --> 1103.6499999999999
the original bank run effect

1100.13 --> 1106.74
remember when everything was still gold

1103.65 --> 1110.16
in vaults in change or silver involves

1106.74 --> 1113.61
in in exchange of promissory notes so

1110.16 --> 1116.0700000000002
now it's all digital but it pretty much

1113.61 --> 1119.3
comes down to the same thing everybody

1116.07 --> 1123.24
wants to cash in then suddenly yeah it

1119.3 --> 1125.79
they cannot because a lot of it is

1123.24 --> 1128.25
potentially virtual and false promises

1125.79 --> 1131.58
and grab their tricks and all that is in

1128.25 --> 1135.87
there it's all it's all one giant mesh

1131.58 --> 1138.72
of those things so then the only

1135.87 --> 1140.79
alternative for the overseers for the

1138.72 --> 1144.1200000000001
controller's of the that monolithic

1140.79 --> 1146.61
system that is basically part of most of

1144.12 --> 1150.4099999999999
the world now they have no choice but to

1146.61 --> 1157.58
then crank it down basically start

1150.41 --> 1161.13
bashing it bashing the dreams like no no

1157.58 --> 1162.6299999999999
you go to slice it down because yeah

1161.13 --> 1165.5700000000002
what you thought you were gonna have

1162.63 --> 1170.73
it's just not gonna happen because it

1165.57 --> 1175.02
doesn't exist that is what happens with

1170.73 --> 1179.31
monolithic systems and the only way to

1175.02 --> 1182.04
prevent huge downfalls like that is by

1179.31 --> 1184.03
completely decentralizing or well

1182.04 --> 1186.42
completely is basically not possible

1184.03 --> 1193.36
but decentralizing as much as possible

1186.42 --> 1196.21
decentralizing like having actual trade

1193.36 --> 1198.1
goods as a backup having that actual

1196.21 --> 1201.76
vault with the gold in it it's extremely

1198.1 --> 1205.03
important also having your own food

1201.76 --> 1207.49
production sources that you can of

1205.03 --> 1209.44
course produce everything because yeah

1207.49 --> 1212.74
it's just too too complicated you have

1209.44 --> 1215.8500000000001
to rely on trade but that if suddenly

1212.74 --> 1218.92
things break down that yeah

1215.85 --> 1221.86
everyone can still survive and still

1218.92 --> 1223.63
thrive even a little maybe with less

1221.86 --> 1227.32
because you can't get all the goods then

1223.63 --> 1231.88
but it's so important these two factors

1227.32 --> 1234.4199999999998
and if that happens then the monolithic

1231.88 --> 1237.64
control that keeps the whole thing going

1234.42 --> 1240.46
with the up and down swings it won't

1237.64 --> 1244.5700000000002
make as much an impact on the countries

1240.46 --> 1248.53
the regions that have this in order that

1244.57 --> 1251.8
have actual faults with stuff in it that

1248.53 --> 1254.35
have actual value on their own that they

1251.8 --> 1257.35
have an under control and if they have

1254.35 --> 1259.6299999999999
their own food production so that

1257.35 --> 1261.6999999999998
everybody could get around if everything

1259.63 --> 1264.5200000000002
was suddenly closed off from the outside

1261.7 --> 1267.5800000000002
world for whatever reason could be

1264.52 --> 1270.73
anything you know in those moments where

1267.58 --> 1272.5
where the banker started ramming down to

1270.73 --> 1274.6
destroy the false promises anything

1272.5 --> 1278.68
weird stuff can roll out of it sudden

1274.6 --> 1283.81
conflicts sudden whatever so having the

1278.68 --> 1286.93
decentralized backup with food and with

1283.81 --> 1289.21
actual value is kind of critical to get

1286.93 --> 1292.48
through all this and you can blatantly

1289.21 --> 1295.06
see which powers in the world which

1292.48 --> 1299.41
countries have this in order and which

1295.06 --> 1302.31
ones do not as much and then you see the

1299.41 --> 1302.3100000000002
consequences

1304.92 --> 1317.26
so yeah these are some of the things

1311.89 --> 1322.39
that weigh on me sometimes because I

1317.26 --> 1326.23
really just won you know I see the good

1322.39 --> 1330.3400000000001
in everything almost everything and just

1326.23 --> 1332.56
like and even bad things I think often

1330.34 --> 1335.1999999999998
like is it really bad or is it just a

1332.56 --> 1338.98
mistake you don't necessarily know you

1335.2 --> 1341.77
know among them will be double Downers

1338.98 --> 1343.72
to the end they will be evil but not

1341.77 --> 1350.82
everyone some are just dragged into this

1343.72 --> 1354.58
[ __ ] and I want the world not to break I

1350.82 --> 1361.1699999999998
wanted to calm the [ __ ] down just like

1354.58 --> 1361.1699999999998
me and just try to do what is sensible

1361.83 --> 1367.4299999999998
try to make the right choices for the

1364.81 --> 1371.339
long run anyway

1367.43 --> 1371.3390000000002
[Music]

1383.48 --> 1386.98
okay what you guys talking about

1388.39 --> 1394.3000000000002
non-perishable items and storage just in

1391.37 --> 1394.3
case that's a good one

1406.59 --> 1409.76
[Music]

1415.05 --> 1425.1399999999999
yeah those tickets seniors I know that's

1420.25 --> 1427.96
but the thing is this virus

1425.14 --> 1432.16
you know this virus like is it that or

1427.96 --> 1434.98
is it just the flu season and people

1432.16 --> 1438.88
getting holds every single year which

1434.98 --> 1442.51
one is it because you can see like who

1438.88 --> 1445.75
did it was done it Mouse made in a

1442.51 --> 1447.55
laboratory a man made it it is evil it's

1445.75 --> 1450.85
going to kill ooh

1447.55 --> 1453.4289999999999
well or it's just the flu season and it

1450.85 --> 1457.99
happens almost every year and then yeah

1453.429 --> 1461.41
the elderly and the infirm they they

1457.99 --> 1463.69
pass on sometimes if their system can't

1461.41 --> 1468.49
take it that's just reality that's just

1463.69 --> 1471.1000000000001
nature I don't see why would you then go

1468.49 --> 1474.7
with this story like even so man did it

1471.1 --> 1477.34
it's like oh we have to blame some human

1474.7 --> 1481.57
for it again you know instead of just

1477.34 --> 1485.07
accepting that it's part of nature yes

1481.57 --> 1485.07
Chet is stuck thank you for the reminder

1490.07 --> 1493.25
thank you

1493.82 --> 1498.84
right

1496.5 --> 1506.7
[Music]

1498.84 --> 1508.8799999999999
yes hey Nathan I see you is it really

1506.7 --> 1508.88
you

1527.23 --> 1532.78
stick it's a knight okay that's

1529.15 --> 1536.23
interesting right that that's what I've

1532.78 --> 1540.73
heard too so it's like they made this

1536.23 --> 1543.94
myth of this Frankenstein virus but from

1540.73 --> 1548.6200000000001
the I have to say rather superficial to

1543.94 --> 1552.88
what I know really is out there it it's

1548.62 --> 1554.799
like these mutant things these

1552.88 --> 1558.7600000000002
Frankenstein's things like does that

1554.799 --> 1560.62
even can that even like take over the

1558.76 --> 1562.72
world that idea that it'll spread

1560.62 --> 1564.9699999999998
everywhere I don't think it can I think

1562.72 --> 1567.88
that the actual mutation effect just

1564.97 --> 1574.57
dies out until it just turns into

1567.88 --> 1578.41
regular the regular thing you know this

1574.57 --> 1581.11
idea that's just that this specific type

1578.41 --> 1583.5700000000002
of mutant it can spread and then it'll

1581.11 --> 1587.37
that mutant will be everywhere over the

1583.57 --> 1587.37
world I don't think that's even possible

1594.84 --> 1600.3899999999999
it's always good to hear from other

1597.25 --> 1603.22
people that had dead know via virology

1600.39 --> 1606.5800000000002
biologists stick its innards

1603.22 --> 1610.45
you know I actually be very glad to

1606.58 --> 1614.08
maybe talk to one maybe even on the show

1610.45 --> 1615.88
if if they want to I asked earlier when

1614.08 --> 1618.52
I basically came out with my German new

1615.88 --> 1621.0
medicine approach of viruses like I I

1618.52 --> 1623.3799999999999
want to talk to people that actually

1621.0 --> 1628.6
looked through the microscopes that

1623.38 --> 1631.5400000000002
actually got much closer up to to the

1628.6 --> 1635.6799999999998
concept of viruses and I want to figure

1631.54 --> 1638.05
it out figure out how much there really

1635.68 --> 1640.69
is to my suspicion and to the old

1638.05 --> 1646.87
research the German new medicine people

1640.69 --> 1649.1200000000001
and all that I just want to know because

1646.87 --> 1650.83
from everything I've seen and learned it

1649.12 --> 1653.32
just seems like the very concept of

1650.83 --> 1656.11
viruses are an oversimplification and I

1653.32 --> 1657.55
personally suspect kind of approaching

1656.11 --> 1660.6
it similar to things that I've come

1657.55 --> 1664.59
across in physics that it is rather a

1660.6 --> 1670.03
secondary effect and not like a primary

1664.59 --> 1672.1
entity as well some type of bacteria can

1670.03 --> 1675.91
be considered that literally that

1672.1 --> 1679.36
bacteria comes into an wound and then it

1675.91 --> 1684.67
infects and it's that bacteria you know

1679.36 --> 1687.6699999999998
that that's much more direct but the

1684.67 --> 1689.89
viruses it just doesn't even seem to be

1687.67 --> 1693.97
like that that's why I've been saying I

1689.89 --> 1696.3400000000001
think it's a a natural side effect to a

1693.97 --> 1698.8600000000001
metabolic overhaul process that is known

1696.34 --> 1701.4399999999998
as the common cold that is there to

1698.86 --> 1704.74
actually help the body purge certain

1701.44 --> 1711.6100000000001
type of toxins that in the general modus

1704.74 --> 1714.49
of doing things it cannot I have never

1711.61 --> 1719.9499999999998
studied viruses not me but I've talked

1714.49 --> 1722.41
to people a lot that have not directly

1719.95 --> 1724.15
even but that have studied the German

1722.41 --> 1725.8500000000001
new medicine approach there's a lot of

1724.15 --> 1729.909
people out there

1725.85 --> 1734.9699999999998
that have done that and and of course

1729.909 --> 1737.529
yeah to just met people for example I

1734.97 --> 1739.63
don't know you you meet a lot of people

1737.529 --> 1741.61
in your life you know and then if it's

1739.63 --> 1743.8890000000001
really interesting then you remember you

1741.61 --> 1747.6
remember what they said and how how they

1743.889 --> 1750.34
presented it but that's what I did I

1747.6 --> 1752.35
don't even know who they were I don't

1750.34 --> 1763.629
even know their names really just know

1752.35 --> 1766.2099999999998
the conversation I'm sure they are where

1763.629 --> 1779.289
Israelis thesis I don't know who you are

1766.21 --> 1783.0900000000001
but yes stick nach stick it Cygnus and

1779.289 --> 1783.09
that's exactly what yeah

1786.89 --> 1793.0700000000002
I wouldn't even say more likely to

1789.26 --> 1796.19
survive I'd rather say you would yeah

1793.07 --> 1798.74
there would be unlikeliness that you

1796.19 --> 1806.8600000000001
have any kind of lasting detriments at

1798.74 --> 1806.86
all just like with the common cold

1814.31 --> 1820.85
Oh and yannis I'm not claiming to be an

1817.7 --> 1824.1200000000001
expert you think it's so funny that that

1820.85 --> 1827.6
I actually allow myself to very

1824.12 --> 1830.9599999999998
seriously get into almost every subject

1827.6 --> 1833.1499999999999
I come across now I used to evade a lot

1830.96 --> 1837.2
of subjects because I felt like I don't

1833.15 --> 1852.2
know it's too big I couldn't reach in

1837.2 --> 1855.56
now I can I can write sticky signature

1852.2 --> 1858.6200000000001
and for example people that are just

1855.56 --> 1860.4199999999998
under heavy stress and use all kinds of

1858.62 --> 1863.1799999999998
pharmaceutical drugs to keep themselves

1860.42 --> 1865.88
stable these people too will kind of be

1863.18 --> 1868.55
[ __ ] because their entire metabolism

1865.88 --> 1873.0500000000002
is just out of whack and then yeah the

1868.55 --> 1876.35
fire any even cold can almost ya can

1873.05 --> 1878.09
have much more severe side effects if

1876.35 --> 1880.2199999999998
your body's not stable because you're

1878.09 --> 1881.4399999999998
basically poisoning it constantly and

1880.22 --> 1891.5
stressing it out

1881.44 --> 1894.38

2124.99 --> 2133.29
that's just dust you know general dust I

2128.41 --> 2133.29
have a carpet that's kind of old and

2134.91 --> 2145.8399999999997
yeah yeah I'm smoker and it yeah it's

2142.42 --> 2149.77
just much more pleasant living with one

2145.84 --> 2152.8
being active here also because sometimes

2149.77 --> 2155.53
you know roommates they I don't know

2152.8 --> 2159.4500000000003
they decide to make like this stink bomb

2155.53 --> 2162.19
and just spray sprayed AOF deodorant

2159.45 --> 2165.7
disgusting chemical crap everywhere and

2162.19 --> 2167.88
then I wish I had a gas mask so I get

2165.7 --> 2172.0899999999997
could get through it without choking and

2167.88 --> 2176.4300000000003
yeah that thing also works against that

2172.09 --> 2180.84
a lot helps a lot it literally destroys

2176.43 --> 2180.8399999999997
yeah what makes it stink so

2184.27 --> 2190.06
no stop smoking save money yeah that's

2187.18 --> 2193.29
so that's the best that's a really great

2190.06 --> 2196.66
order of doing thing that works right so

2193.29 --> 2199.33
not have an air filter then completely

2196.66 --> 2201.3999999999996
stress out from trying to not smoke

2199.33 --> 2212.38
anymore it's not a really good

2201.4 --> 2214.54
combination hey Thank You Amanda um to

2212.38 --> 2216.31

2214.54 --> 2217.84

38 euros man oh thank you so much man I

2243.99 --> 2252.75

2248.16 --> 2257.24
but yeah I'm gonna definitely need it of

2252.75 --> 2257.24
course and I guess that

2259.43 --> 2263.569
I think that most of these bigger

2261.349 --> 2265.369
donations are truly meant for my air

2263.569 --> 2268.099
filter so that's what I'm gonna save it

2265.369 --> 2271.75
up for and yeah maybe I guess not my

2268.099 --> 2278.0
GoFundMe is gonna have the most of it

2271.75 --> 2279.98
I'll try to keep track of it all but

2278.0 --> 2283.839
thank you so much Amanda Young it's very

2279.98 --> 2283.839
generous of you thank you so much

2288.13 --> 2291.219
[Music]

2303.19 --> 2309.64
really tiny one but it doesn't add up

2305.91 --> 2313.479
well maybe I don't do the smoking

2309.64 --> 2317.7
because I'm thinking it's healthy maybe

2313.479 --> 2321.6699999999996
I do it because it helps me relax or

2317.7 --> 2326.6499999999996
gets my mind off things or I just like

2321.67 --> 2330.2690000000002
it and I try not to smoke too much look

2326.65 --> 2334.869
I still use these filters you know

2330.269 --> 2338.019
carbon filter so that's already yeah

2334.869 --> 2340.569
some of the tar will be taken out so I

2338.019 --> 2343.1189999999997
have less detriment of the smoking

2340.569 --> 2348.3089999999997
process so yeah I am damn well taking

2343.119 --> 2350.799
care of my health but yeah just stopping

2348.309 --> 2358.21
smoking oh sure that's just like oh yeah

2350.799 --> 2360.609
it's so freaking easy smoked organic off

2358.21 --> 2362.65
I wish I could well there's there's not

2360.609 --> 2365.17
there's no smooth tobacco in the

2362.65 --> 2368.079
Netherlands that's organic it doesn't

2365.17 --> 2369.759
exist you would have to order that from

2368.079 --> 2374.17
special sites and everything and

2369.759 --> 2376.079
probably expensive like my buddy Rasta

2374.17 --> 2380.289
had knows all kinds of connections

2376.079 --> 2384.2490000000003
there's like this great tobacco hole

2380.289 --> 2386.7690000000002
Leafs you can get from Canada but that

2384.249 --> 2390.3089999999997
is also kind of expensive in shipping

2386.769 --> 2393.16
and all that but yeah American spirit I

2390.309 --> 2395.9790000000003
use American spirit but yeah they've

2393.16 --> 2397.5389999999998
literally cut down the types of American

2395.979 --> 2401.4689999999996
spirits that are even available in the

2397.539 --> 2404.19
Netherlands to just one just one and

2401.469 --> 2406.66
that's this one the light blue ones

2404.19 --> 2409.4500000000003
there used to be a yellow one that was

2406.66 --> 2412.239
slightly lighter they took it out so

2409.45 --> 2416.41
they're literally just cutting it all

2412.239 --> 2417.91
out you can't get it more than in the

2416.41 --> 2420.819
general stores they just stopped

2417.91 --> 2422.94
producing it they stopped distributing

2420.819 --> 2422.94
it

2426.23 --> 2432.15
yeah and I'm third in America there are

2429.63 --> 2437.31
other versions there's like a turquoise

2432.15 --> 2438.9900000000002
one like this that is yeah that is

2437.31 --> 2442.5
actually supposed to be organic yeah I

2438.99 --> 2445.08
wish I that those were here I wish it's

2442.5 --> 2447.0
not here you can't find it I've asked

2445.08 --> 2449.04
trust me I asked I even asked like could

2447.0 --> 2450.6
you do like a special order maybe no

2449.04 --> 2454.89
it's just they don't even have the

2450.6 --> 2458.1
option to order it it's messed up it's

2454.89 --> 2460.44
this game this stupid industry game

2458.1 --> 2463.92
that's being played just designating

2460.44 --> 2466.35
like no this is what they're gonna get

2463.92 --> 2468.9300000000003
that's what they're gonna get it's it's

2466.35 --> 2470.58
really pissing me off because it's not

2468.93 --> 2473.31
just with tobacco by the way it's also

2470.58 --> 2475.7999999999997
in in the food industry even the organic

2473.31 --> 2479.88
brands have that kind of nonsense we're

2475.8 --> 2482.73
just this brand just so like no it's now

2479.88 --> 2484.8
this one because that's the deal they

2482.73 --> 2487.32
made and now this brand just suddenly is

2484.8 --> 2493.53
no longer in their in their grocery

2487.32 --> 2496.73
store it's really annoying but yeah

2493.53 --> 2496.73
that's just how it seems to work

2501.81 --> 2506.31
don't be rude and your knees

2516.789 --> 2523.759
yeah I think I think onion ease is a

2520.099 --> 2531.949
troll or if she's not it's just really

2523.759 --> 2534.349
freaking annoying like only a troll or a

2531.949 --> 2539.689
complete [ __ ] would say something like

2534.349 --> 2542.779
smoking is low IQ that's it's not the

2539.689 --> 2545.199
smartest thing to start doing from just

2542.779 --> 2547.519
a common perspective yeah that's right

2545.199 --> 2549.799
but yeah

2547.519 --> 2554.709
some of the smartest people in the world

2549.799 --> 2561.069
have been smokers not saying all of them

2554.709 --> 2563.5989999999997
because it it does something helps focus

2561.069 --> 2566.5389999999998
with a lot of people so it's complete

2563.599 --> 2573.8590000000004
nonsense to say that smoking is low IQ

2566.539 --> 2575.7490000000003
that's just ridiculous yeah that's right

2573.859 --> 2584.269
I know Mark caller i banned her because

2575.749 --> 2591.049
I think she's a troll just multiple it's

2584.269 --> 2593.569
just exit okay well yeah whatever

2591.049 --> 2596.869
Einstein smoked this is I don't care

2593.569 --> 2598.999
look there's the other mythology that

2596.869 --> 2601.489
also came up since the mind control

2598.999 --> 2604.7889999999998
sixties that smoking makes you

2601.489 --> 2607.429
intelligent now that is stupid that is

2604.789 --> 2610.3390000000004
kind of like another grab ler tick like

2607.429 --> 2612.14
oh you want to be smart smoke yeah that

2610.339 --> 2616.64
[ __ ] that's not what I'm saying

2612.14 --> 2619.279
I'm just saying smoking is not

2616.64 --> 2622.779
necessarily associated with lower IQ

2619.279 --> 2622.779
it's just not true

2633.95 --> 2638.1499999999996
[Music]

2639.02 --> 2644.84
good for you Tom Parker

2641.64 --> 2644.8399999999997
[Music]

2651.36 --> 2658.56
ah stick escena soon as I don't think

2655.11 --> 2660.3900000000003
Einstein was really that smart I think

2658.56 --> 2664.86
that a lot of people know that he really

2660.39 --> 2667.3799999999997
wasn't that smart he was a wizard in the

2664.86 --> 2670.02
sense that he was very good at using his

2667.38 --> 2673.4700000000003
conceptual thinking a medium structuring

2670.02 --> 2675.84
to fool around he was just playing

2673.47 --> 2678.33
around with his conceptions in a way I

2675.84 --> 2681.3
feel sometimes like I'm kind of doing

2678.33 --> 2683.94
the same thing I'm just not gonna

2681.3 --> 2685.98
cooperate in fooling the world with that

2683.94 --> 2688.44
nonsense just to help a bunch of

2685.98 --> 2692.03
controllers keep people's minds under

2688.44 --> 2692.03
control now screw that

2692.13 --> 2696.15
that's what Einstein did he was

2693.72 --> 2698.97
corrupted he was very very very

2696.15 --> 2702.6
corrupted in so many ways because he was

2698.97 --> 2705.6499999999996
pitiful there's a pitiful character he

2702.6 --> 2713.72
was not brilliant he was smart

2705.65 --> 2717.78
but he was not truly brilliant you know

2713.72 --> 2719.31
like compare that to somebody like Tesla

2717.78 --> 2724.1400000000003
that is brilliant

2719.31 --> 2728.64
that's not smart that's bizarre insights

2724.14 --> 2731.5499999999997
bizarre long-term insights and this

2728.64 --> 2733.5299999999997
connection with the greater good for

2731.55 --> 2736.02
real the real connection with God with

2733.53 --> 2739.86
the inside that man was as ascended as

2736.02 --> 2744.27
they got and he was stuck and he knew

2739.86 --> 2746.55
like he knew I'm pretty sure every step

2744.27 --> 2748.86
of the way like even though he might not

2746.55 --> 2752.94
be occupying his mind with it

2748.86 --> 2756.06
in his conscious linear time moments but

2752.94 --> 2757.9500000000003
he just knew exactly where it was all

2756.06 --> 2760.41
going what was gonna happen with what he

2757.95 --> 2763.29
did and what the risks would be and

2760.41 --> 2764.97
that's why he just said like no I don't

2763.29 --> 2767.43
care anymore I'm just gonna retract I'm

2764.97 --> 2769.8599999999997
just gonna figure this out for myself I

2767.43 --> 2771.72
don't care what the world is gonna do

2769.86 --> 2772.59
with it anymore because the world is

2771.72 --> 2775.89
messed up

2772.59 --> 2777.4500000000003
in a way and I'm gonna try to ignore it

2775.89 --> 2779.93
the most and leave it in the hands of

2777.45 --> 2779.93
God

2779.99 --> 2786.5089999999996
so yeah Einstein was corrupted you were

2784.41 --> 2790.2
smart but he wasn't a genius

2786.509 --> 2794.309
and he was very corrupted in many ways

2790.2 --> 2800.99
morally socially and he was the deviant

2794.309 --> 2800.9900000000002
it was a sexual deviant very bad so yeah

2801.859 --> 2809.93
and I'm if I remember correctly I think

2805.319 --> 2809.93
that was it wasn't Tesla also a smoker

2810.17 --> 2815.759
not 100% sure but I think I've seen him

2813.119 --> 2825.9500000000003
with a pipe let's see if I can find

2815.759 --> 2825.95
something I could be wrong though

2831.34 --> 2839.6200000000003
it might have been like yeah I think I

2837.37 --> 2842.56
was I'm wrong I don't see him any

2839.62 --> 2845.47
photographs ever with a pipe or anything

2842.56 --> 2847.36
so yeah I think he wasn't the smoker so

2845.47 --> 2851.1699999999996
I retract that I think I was wrong about

2847.36 --> 2853.65
that assumption didn't have the time for

2851.17 --> 2853.65
that nonsense

2870.61 --> 2877.8700000000003
yeah is it let's take a cynic yeah sorry

2874.51 --> 2885.73
but I'm Stein was a clown he was a

2877.87 --> 2887.08
puppet and he was loathed by the actual

2885.73 --> 2891.37
intellectual community at the time

2887.08 --> 2893.74
loathed they hated him and they weren't

2891.37 --> 2896.91
holding back on that [ __ ] they hated him

2893.74 --> 2900.0099999999998
they knew exactly what he was

2896.91 --> 2904.54
because only a dumb ass would fall for

2900.01 --> 2910.0800000000004
that kind of wizardry Einstein was

2904.54 --> 2910.08
loathed understand

2926.25 --> 2932.82
Charles Proteus Steinmetz what a name I

2930.099 --> 2936.69
have no idea who that is but that name

2932.82 --> 2936.69
sound pretty incredible

2945.73 --> 2954.29
right Tom Parker

2948.38 --> 2956.36
yeah Owen Benjamin had a I don't know

2954.29 --> 2960.2
well that was recently or if I saw an

2956.36 --> 2963.6800000000003
older video buddy like good explanation

2960.2 --> 2969.41
about Tesla what he did you put it down

2963.68 --> 2971.45
really well do I consider myself to be

2969.41 --> 2974.5699999999997
more intelligent than Einstein well how

2971.45 --> 2977.47
would I know how could I you know I'm

2974.57 --> 2981.3500000000004
pretty sure he was absolutely

2977.47 --> 2986.39
mathematically more apt than myself I'm

2981.35 --> 2988.73
not a mathematical genius but as to well

2986.39 --> 2991.04
a lot of other things yeah I think that

2988.73 --> 2993.68
I am probably smarter than he used to be

2991.04 --> 2996.5299999999997
because he just made so many stupid

2993.68 --> 2998.98
mistakes that just it's just blatantly

2996.53 --> 2998.98
obvious

3009.76 --> 3016.25
Steinmetz I'm looking I will look it up

3012.41 --> 3019.58
I name sounds awesome but I have no idea

3016.25 --> 3025.69
who it is at least not at this time let

3019.58 --> 3031.48
me look up the name Charles Proteus

3025.69 --> 3031.48
Steinmetz come on

3041.73 --> 3055.12
Wow

3043.18 --> 3057.43
man he was a little guy 90 1865 to 1923

3055.12 --> 3060.37
this is where I never heard of this guy

3057.43 --> 3067.72
before never seen it it's like the first

3060.37 --> 3070.12
time now that I see is German born

3067.72 --> 3073.8399999999997
American mathematician and electrical

3070.12 --> 3086.85
engineer alternating current for a

3073.84 --> 3086.8500000000004
minute oh really okay are you sure

3091.14 --> 3099.019
what they called him the Wizard of

3093.319 --> 3099.019
scenic cynic Teddy weird

3105.01 --> 3111.4900000000002
because

3107.16 --> 3115.8399999999997
that's kind of the same now this was

3111.49 --> 3118.81
before Tesla right

3115.84 --> 3122.4100000000003
Tesla died later but it was still during

3118.81 --> 3123.88
that time so did they meet I don't know

3122.41 --> 3130.99
this is like the first time I've ever

3123.88 --> 3135.07
seen this yeah this seems like a

3130.99 --> 3138.8799999999997
complicated guy I can't just give any

3135.07 --> 3141.6400000000003
preliminary opinion on this there's

3138.88 --> 3149.04
something interesting about him it's

3141.64 --> 3151.8399999999997
this interesting look very calm

3149.04 --> 3157.0
interesting anyway I'll check him out

3151.84 --> 3159.67
thanks for the tip well Karen B yeah

3157.0 --> 3162.01
it's like how could they not have met

3159.67 --> 3163.9
you know they were in the same things

3162.01 --> 3166.3
like it would be crazy if they hadn't

3163.9 --> 3170.05
met they were both in America right this

3166.3 --> 3173.6800000000003
guy was German American born Tesla was

3170.05 --> 3178.9
from what is it over the yeast somewhere

3173.68 --> 3180.0989999999997
he's Europe and he came he I don't

3178.9 --> 3182.6800000000003
remember the country sorry

3180.099 --> 3185.23
he came to America so it's like it

3182.68 --> 3189.0699999999997
worked on similar things the electrical

3185.23 --> 3192.75
net so just like how could they not have

3189.07 --> 3192.75
met at some point that would be crazy

3213.36 --> 3223.4100000000003
what do I think of Einstein's biggest

3215.58 --> 3225.45
mistake I think his biggest mistake were

3223.41 --> 3231.8399999999997
personal I think his biggest mistake was

3225.45 --> 3236.6699999999996
his just in temporal arrogance that he

3231.84 --> 3238.9500000000003
thought that he yeah that his wizard

3236.67 --> 3242.28
leanness that he was just thinking that

3238.95 --> 3248.52
he was smarter than everyone and that he

3242.28 --> 3251.1800000000003
would trick people that he led things

3248.52 --> 3251.18
astray

3255.96 --> 3261.02
is there now drama yeah that's

3258.69 --> 3261.02
interesting

3274.24 --> 3283.2999999999997
yeah William I know argon don't exist

3279.61 --> 3288.46
and we're shown to be soda so you really

3283.3 --> 3296.01
stick knit yeah except they do work I've

3288.46 --> 3296.01
built them they work or gun devices work

3307.72 --> 3313.45
you know pseudoscience yeah dr. Emoto

3311.35 --> 3315.62
well it's also called a sewer

3313.45 --> 3317.93
pseudo-scientists well you better damn

3315.62 --> 3322.72
well believe that he put forth some

3317.93 --> 3325.46
really fascinating empirical data so ya

3322.72 --> 3328.1299999999997
pseudoscientist who gives a [ __ ] what

3325.46 --> 3340.67
they say the results are there you can

3328.13 --> 3342.9500000000003
do it you can do it yourself right I'm

3340.67 --> 3347.63
Stein was just playing around with his

3342.95 --> 3349.8799999999997
conceptual mediums you know that's what

3347.63 --> 3352.34
he was doing he figured out the 4-space

3349.88 --> 3354.35
idea or while he probably didn't even

3352.34 --> 3358.04
figure it out it was brought forth and

3354.35 --> 3360.5299999999997
then he kind of made that his his own

3358.04 --> 3363.92
and then presented it to the world as a

3360.53 --> 3367.34
wizard solution to a problem that could

3363.92 --> 3373.6
not be fixed mainly the nonsense

3367.34 --> 3373.6000000000004
concerning gravity that's what he did

3373.78 --> 3381.23
but he didn't prove anything he just

3376.48 --> 3385.67
created a bypass an alternative medium

3381.23 --> 3388.25
to trick people with basically causing

3385.67 --> 3391.94
them to try to suspend their disbelief

3388.25 --> 3394.28
in order to bypass that what he was

3391.94 --> 3396.58
talking about was not actually the real

3394.28 --> 3396.5800000000004
world

3412.37 --> 3418.7599999999998
time travel lols yeah yeah time travel

3416.87 --> 3421.22
like that only works in conceptual

3418.76 --> 3424.3100000000004
mediums too so

3421.22 --> 3424.31
[Music]

3427.12 --> 3432.08
[Music]

3429.59 --> 3434.81
and I've theorized a lot about time

3432.08 --> 3437.93
travel my general conclusions is that

3434.81 --> 3440.29
you could call it time travel but

3437.93 --> 3444.44
effectively it's not going to be that

3440.29 --> 3447.2
it's just anything that would supposedly

3444.44 --> 3451.67
travel even theoretically to another

3447.2 --> 3455.06
time in the same realm right if you're

3451.67 --> 3458.84
gonna take that science-fiction leap and

3455.06 --> 3463.67
say it's possible then yeah as soon as

3458.84 --> 3467.6000000000004
you travel it's just it leaves because

3463.67 --> 3469.4
it's not in the same timeframe anymore

3467.6 --> 3471.86
so it just leaves it's likely it

3469.4 --> 3473.96
whatever is gonna travel away to some

3471.86 --> 3476.1800000000003
other time it leaves and it's just

3473.96 --> 3477.77
effectively this integrated to that time

3476.18 --> 3479.24
and nothing is gonna change because it

3477.77 --> 3482.96
can't because everything has already

3479.24 --> 3485.87
happened but wherever the thing goes

3482.96 --> 3489.08
into do powers - blah blah blah yeah

3485.87 --> 3491.27
it's just gonna enter a new dimension

3489.08 --> 3494.75
it's just like being inserted into the

3491.27 --> 3496.7599999999998
the game again and that's the game

3494.75 --> 3499.82
they're gonna be yet and they're even

3496.76 --> 3502.75
the idea of traveling back is absolutely

3499.82 --> 3506.3900000000003
ridiculous that's kind of the thing that

3502.75 --> 3508.46
held me up a little with the with the

3506.39 --> 3510.44
Back to the Future series just this idea

3508.46 --> 3512.69
that you could travel and then return

3510.44 --> 3518.44
and then Oh some things may be different

3512.69 --> 3518.44
oh really well I don't think so

3520.859 --> 3527.0989999999997
and I think they kind of kind of tried

3524.759 --> 3530.549
to put that there that how much chaos

3527.099 --> 3533.2200000000003
can actually happen but they still apply

3530.549 --> 3536.4
it to specific key individuals

3533.22 --> 3538.069
oh I the way that I see it as soon as

3536.4 --> 3540.63
something travels through time

3538.069 --> 3542.69
everything is going to be reset because

3540.63 --> 3545.19
suddenly the entire preponderance of

3542.69 --> 3548.609
creation and the game it will have

3545.19 --> 3551.309
something there that's just inserted

3548.609 --> 3553.739
into the physical reality that'll change

3551.309 --> 3556.289
the balance of everything it's like the

3553.739 --> 3560.73
entire foundational pattern now changes

3556.289 --> 3564.42
so it could never ever return to where

3560.73 --> 3566.999
it would be potentially in the future

3564.42 --> 3568.829
where the time traveler came from it's

3566.999 --> 3572.4599999999996
just never gonna be possible I even

3568.829 --> 3577.799
wrote a short story about this when I

3572.46 --> 3582.15
was 10 I still have it somewhere was my

3577.799 --> 3583.009
story about time travel it was kind of

3582.15 --> 3591.9300000000003
ridiculous

3583.009 --> 3594.2690000000002
but yeah that's my time travel you know

3591.93 --> 3596.759
it's it's very interesting it's an

3594.269 --> 3597.6299999999997
interesting concept but it's just

3596.759 --> 3600.44
science fiction

3597.63 --> 3600.44
really

3625.62 --> 3631.7999999999997
well good servant time is the linear

3629.34 --> 3634.28
progression of change throughout the

3631.8 --> 3634.28
realm

3640.89 --> 3648.42
it's basically the the condition of

3644.79 --> 3654.32
entropy it's like time is what makes

3648.42 --> 3654.32
entropy possible no time no entropy

3657.9 --> 3664.23
but yeah you could not prove that

3660.11 --> 3667.35
because you cannot take away time so it

3664.23 --> 3669.29
is a conceptual approach no time no

3667.35 --> 3671.58
entropy but that's just more like a

3669.29 --> 3673.56
correlation based logical conclusion

3671.58 --> 3675.15
that it's like scientific provable

3673.56 --> 3678.2599999999998
that's nonsense you can't prove that G

3675.15 --> 3678.26
cuz you can't stop time

3708.19 --> 3711.329
[Music]

3719.07 --> 3722.07
okay

3738.99 --> 3743.1499999999996
what are you asking me giddy and sick

3745.339 --> 3753.13
that look

3748.1 --> 3756.0499999999997
a the man-made is more to bypass

3753.13 --> 3759.32
machinations because a phenomena can't

3756.05 --> 3761.78
be a man-made thing and now just because

3759.32 --> 3764.9300000000003
time and entropy are not man-made does

3761.78 --> 3773.42
not mean that you then can actually very

3764.93 --> 3775.73
manipulate them see the only thing you

3773.42 --> 3779.09
can do with time and with entropy is

3775.73 --> 3783.79
with time you can let it pass and with

3779.09 --> 3786.05
entropy you can let it happen that's it

3783.79 --> 3789.34
that's the only thing you can do with it

3786.05 --> 3789.34
you can manipulate it

3808.83 --> 3814.95
yeah I think it is infinitely more easy

3811.41 --> 3818.67
to manipulate yourself into believing

3814.95 --> 3821.1299999999997
that you can and might potentially have

3818.67 --> 3824.4
manipulated time than it is to actually

3821.13 --> 3829.9700000000003
manipulate time because how would you do

3824.4 --> 3829.9700000000003
that you can't

3839.91 --> 3846.48
by pastime now you can you can't bypass

3843.27 --> 3849.45
time times gonna happen you can't you

3846.48 --> 3852.539
can't skip it only thing you can do is

3849.45 --> 3858.71
put your consciousness in a standby mode

3852.539 --> 3861.599
so it does not attune to time and then

3858.71 --> 3864.39
the moment may pass but that's just the

3861.599 --> 3868.6090000000004
conscious experience the actual time is

3864.39 --> 3868.609
still happening in linear fashion

3892.92 --> 3902.14
really so if you travel more than

3899.319 --> 3904.089
Lightspeed well I think if you travel

3902.14 --> 3906.0989999999997
more than Lightspeed you're gonna be

3904.089 --> 3909.869
splattered then there's nothing to gonna

3906.099 --> 3914.2000000000003
be that would be measured really so

3909.869 --> 3916.109
nothing can speed travel the speed of

3914.2 --> 3919.96
light

3916.109 --> 3924.46
there's no way how would you get to that

3919.96 --> 3927.839
speed doesn't work there's no room like

3924.46 --> 3932.619
technically let's just get really crazy

3927.839 --> 3935.38
outrageous here okay so what if the

3932.619 --> 3937.329
realm was indeed flat rectangular

3935.38 --> 3939.67
looping and there would be a perfectly

3937.329 --> 3942.13
straight line loop from east to west

3939.67 --> 3945.279
now that might yield the only

3942.13 --> 3948.489
possibility ever if you even want to try

3945.279 --> 3950.529
something as crazy as that for a ship of

3948.489 --> 3951.94
some kind with a perfect stabilizer

3950.529 --> 3955.779
magnetic stabilizer whatever

3951.94 --> 3962.559
electrostatics likes I've to go light

3955.779 --> 3965.559
speed to that perfect line well yeah

3962.559 --> 3968.44
just imagine just keep going keep going

3965.559 --> 3971.619
well there is the air and that friction

3968.44 --> 3973.4790000000003
is going to increase continually so what

3971.619 --> 3978.039
is the alternative building a giant

3973.479 --> 3979.96
vacuum tube like a cyclotron but not a

3978.039 --> 3982.6600000000003
cyclotron nodes would actually be a

3979.96 --> 3985.9
looping straight tube with a vacuum well

3982.66 --> 3987.94
potentially something could then in some

3985.9 --> 3992.44
way go to light speed but what is the

3987.94 --> 3994.4500000000003
point you need so much distance to even

3992.44 --> 3996.339
potentially get to that speed and then

3994.45 --> 3998.229
what what then with all the energies

3996.339 --> 4001.859
being unleashed of just something going

3998.229 --> 4004.109
that speed it's insane why would you

4001.859 --> 4007.259
even want to do that there's no need to

4004.109 --> 4009.66
go Lightspeed because there is no

4007.259 --> 4014.009
distance in existing physical existence

4009.66 --> 4018.69
in order to even need that kind of

4014.009 --> 4022.38
velocities see

4018.69 --> 4024.53
there's no use it's only using a

4022.38 --> 4028.02
fantastical science-fiction realm with

4024.53 --> 4030.84
seemingly infinite distances then it

4028.02 --> 4033.05
becomes a useful thing it is only in

4030.84 --> 4033.05
that

4043.04 --> 4046.119
[Music]

4049.88 --> 4058.2290000000003
[Music]

4087.44 --> 4093.4700000000003
anyways yeah you know science fiction

4091.069 --> 4096.62
concepts can even be interesting to

4093.47 --> 4103.639999999999
ponder upon and reflect upon in the face

4096.62 --> 4106.489
of kinda real-world settings that we can

4103.64 --> 4108.08
figure out and then yeah the first thing

4106.489 --> 4110.718999999999
that becomes apparent really no matter

4108.08 --> 4113.33
how you think of it with outer space

4110.719 --> 4114.67
gone because it cannot be possible

4113.33 --> 4116.83
because of the second law of

4114.67 --> 4119.299
thermodynamics violation that it poses

4116.83 --> 4122.5689999999995
face of the gas pressure on earth

4119.299 --> 4124.79
well if there is a limited space in some

4122.569 --> 4128.75
way then and there is no vacuum

4124.79 --> 4135.46
naturally then the very concept of

4128.75 --> 4138.44
Lightspeed just becomes ridiculous and

4135.46 --> 4142.66
absurdly dangerous to should even

4138.44 --> 4142.66
consider doing something like that

4177.16 --> 4184.48
I really you think so savoia but how

4181.57 --> 4187.679999999999
would there be enough room and who's to

4184.48 --> 4192.339999999999
say that once you go certain velocities

4187.68 --> 4197.37
in a ratio compared to surroundings that

4192.34 --> 4200.5
the very thing moving past one another

4197.37 --> 4205.51
right even if it was in fact you just

4200.5 --> 4209.29
the motion at a distance might have

4205.51 --> 4212.650000000001
unexpected side effects may be suddenly

4209.29 --> 4216.76
out of nowhere like a sort of Kapler

4212.65 --> 4219.5199999999995
forces or I don't know forces might the

4216.76 --> 4223.24
general forces like even surface tension

4219.52 --> 4226.540000000001
somehow might jump out out of nowhere

4223.24 --> 4229.57
because of the extremities because of

4226.54 --> 4231.91
the physical extremities that just might

4229.57 --> 4234.549999999999
warp the energy functions of things

4231.91 --> 4236.95
themselves and probably eventually

4234.55 --> 4242.8
result even if you build up slowly in

4236.95 --> 4244.95
just the disintegration of matter you

4242.8 --> 4248.35
know that's what I think would happen

4244.95 --> 4251.65
I'm pretty sure you could go absurd

4248.35 --> 4255.01
speeds maybe like but not Lightspeed

4251.65 --> 4260.17
that's just insane that's just there's

4255.01 --> 4262.84
no way and why again why like I would

4260.17 --> 4265.24
imagine that even if let's just imagine

4262.84 --> 4269.26
for a moment that a rectangular looping

4265.24 --> 4272.44
realm would turn out to have a thousand

4269.26 --> 4274.66
more earth realm segments to the north

4272.44 --> 4278.889999999999
and the south of it a thousand more

4274.66 --> 4280.96
right incredible distances and it what

4278.89 --> 4282.9400000000005
if it's all so perfectly flat and

4280.96 --> 4285.28
looping that you could now get that tube

4282.94 --> 4286.48
north to south to be kind of crazy

4285.28 --> 4288.16
because it would have to go through

4286.48 --> 4290.799999999999
extreme temperature situation it would

4288.16 --> 4296.5599999999995
be such an insane project that's never

4290.8 --> 4298.54
gonna happen well you could go

4296.56 --> 4300.9400000000005
incredible speeds and then move very

4298.54 --> 4303.46
fast between realm sections potentially

4300.94 --> 4306.58
but it's not it how is that even gonna

4303.46 --> 4310.05
come close anywhere to this suppose at

4306.58 --> 4310.05
light speed makes no sense

4311.7 --> 4318.58
now sir check oh the flat globe is just

4315.58 --> 4323.2
one option it's just one potential thing

4318.58 --> 4327.04
that could be and the flat globe is

4323.2 --> 4331.8099999999995
basically based on an irregular looping

4327.04 --> 4336.57
earth so there would be a loop is the

4331.81 --> 4340.3
West but you know well in a flat globe

4336.57 --> 4342.549999999999
rectangular looping system the equators

4340.3 --> 4345.91
would be further apart those parts

4342.55 --> 4347.8
looping would be further apart then to

4345.91 --> 4351.61
the north so it would almost be well

4347.8 --> 4355.360000000001
like be stretched up rectangular map you

4351.61 --> 4359.74
know it that one that's kind of a flat

4355.36 --> 4362.099999999999
flow and still all connected so flat

4359.74 --> 4367.3
though yeah super super surreal

4362.1 --> 4369.13
irregular spatial linearity and that

4367.3 --> 4371.5
would effectively be a flat globe

4369.13 --> 4375.1900000000005
because the map all of the segments

4371.5 --> 4377.08
would it would fit as if they were a

4375.19 --> 4382.509999999999
geometrical globe but they are all

4377.08 --> 4385.0
fitting perfectly parallel and flat so

4382.51 --> 4390.0
yeah that makes no logical sense

4385.0 --> 4391.78
welcome to freakin sir reality yeah

4390.0 --> 4393.49
because things are not as

4391.78 --> 4395.11
straightforward probably as we all like

4393.49 --> 4396.54
them to be and that's already kind of

4395.11 --> 4399.94
apparent with the globe of the heavens

4396.54 --> 4404.11
right so who says it's just gonna stop

4399.94 --> 4407.44
with that no a very space of the realm

4404.11 --> 4412.92
we stand in may simply turn out not to

4407.44 --> 4412.919999999999
be linear in one or multiple ways

4423.559 --> 4428.469
all right well the flat globe is

4426.139 --> 4432.71
basically a flat surface that is

4428.469 --> 4435.289
interconnected as in a way that would

4432.71 --> 4438.02
probably be the easiest to present in

4435.289 --> 4439.94
globe fashion when you're then

4438.02 --> 4442.369000000001
physically model out the globe yeah that

4439.94 --> 4447.44
would be like the best way potentially

4442.369 --> 4450.7699999999995
to represent the land masses most it is

4447.44 --> 4454.159
but the thing is it would not literally

4450.77 --> 4458.42
be that it would just be a way to more

4454.159 --> 4461.21
easily then project the land masses in a

4458.42 --> 4463.61
way that becomes tangible for our use

4461.21 --> 4466.719
but in actuality it would literally all

4463.61 --> 4472.299999999999
be flat yeah that is the flat globe

4466.719 --> 4475.84
presented it in episode 1 on my channel

4472.3 --> 4475.84
all those years ago

4483.72 --> 4488.46
guys I think I'm going to round out the

4485.61 --> 4490.17
show because it is three o'clock over

4488.46 --> 4493.2300000000005
here and I think the Flat Earth debates

4490.17 --> 4497.85
are about to start up so yeah I hope you

4493.23 --> 4498.03
appreciated this slightly longer Flat

4497.85 --> 4499.68
Earth

4498.03 --> 4503.09
early-bird why started earlier because

4499.68 --> 4503.09
apparently the time change

4503.28 --> 4507.78
yeah anyway if you liked the video then

4505.56 --> 4509.25
please don't forget to Rogen's up and if

4507.78 --> 4510.179999999999

please don't forget about my GoFundMe I

4533.49 --> 4542.969999999999
would specifically like that one to be

4535.65 --> 4548.009999999999
yea filled up yeah so that I can get my

4542.97 --> 4549.39
fresh air filter system right I'll be

4548.01 --> 4552.06
back tomorrow flat earth early bird

4549.39 --> 4553.4400000000005
number 473 and I'm going to join the

4552.06 --> 4557.330000000001
Flat Earth debates that have just

4553.44 --> 4561.089999999999
started up so yeah until the next video

4557.33 --> 4563.42
hashtag meifa uber more cool and keep it

4561.09 --> 4563.42
