73.189 --> 78.86
so guys anything to talk about

81.5 --> 87.869
silence alright you gotta love it the

84.75 --> 92.549
early morning silence well you know

87.869 --> 96.24
could be anything like don't really care

92.549 --> 98.85000000000001
about something interesting during tooth

96.24 --> 102.75
brushing happen or something but you

98.85 --> 106.47
know whatever any dreams I yeah this is

102.75 --> 109.049
let me start out but yeah don't blame me

106.47 --> 112.92
if I will be talking over you constantly

109.049 --> 117.119
now I gave you the opportunity but go

112.92 --> 123.36
for right yeah I've noticed that I still

117.119 --> 128.429
dream like I smoke cannabis still and up

123.36 --> 131.03
to pretty late usually safe like a batch

128.429 --> 131.03
and

131.23 --> 140.409
I dream so funny thing is though is that

137.7 --> 144.069
during this dreaming process

140.409 --> 147.60999999999999
it's almost yeah I know it's a dream

144.069 --> 149.379
like like my belief and my insights it

147.61 --> 151.51000000000002
works slightly different so there is

149.379 --> 153.94
kind of a suspense of disbelief effect

151.51 --> 156.97
going on but I just recognized the

153.94 --> 159.76
entire feel of it it's like this setting

156.97 --> 166.209
just like I recognized the setting of

159.76 --> 170.23
real life so I just yeah do do what you

166.209 --> 171.94
do in dreams but I still dream and I

170.23 --> 174.73
remember it I don't remember it very

171.94 --> 176.98
vividly it's not like lucid dreams I

174.73 --> 179.26
don't have a lot of those but they'll

176.98 --> 182.82899999999998
needs those you know usually too

179.26 --> 186.489
overwhelming anyway but I still dream so

182.829 --> 188.489
yeah I hear a lot of people say yeah I

186.489 --> 192.31
smoke cannabis and I don't dream anymore

188.489 --> 194.799
well maybe that's how it starts out it

192.31 --> 197.38
kind of did for me as well like I had a

194.799 --> 201.43
period early on or I smoked a lot and I

197.38 --> 204.299
didn't dream or very rarely usually

201.43 --> 207.28
spend a lot of time daydreaming but not

204.299 --> 210.70000000000002
really dreaming when I was sleeping and

207.28 --> 215.819
that did happen but it's now no longer

210.7 --> 215.819
like that now so how about you guys

218.22 --> 224.319
anybody anybody yeah I used to when I

221.98 --> 226.51
was younger before when I was still in

224.319 --> 227.64999999999998
high school middle school - in the

226.51 --> 232.269
transition middle school to high school

227.65 --> 234.549
I was maybe 15 16 I found this this book

232.269 --> 237.489
like a little booklet on how to control

234.549 --> 240.459
your dreams and I was very into it by

237.489 --> 242.609
that time when I was a teenager and I

240.459 --> 244.78
read it and it was about the

242.609 --> 247.72
concentration when you go to sleep and

244.78 --> 250.84
breathe this way and think about these

247.72 --> 253.449
things and I don't know a little little

250.84 --> 255.489
setup on how to control your dreams when

253.449 --> 257.889
you go to sleep and you know what just

255.489 --> 260.26
because of that little pamphlet maybe it

257.889 --> 262.539
was a joke or something but I took it I

260.26 --> 264.849
II went by the rules you know by

262.539 --> 265.15
whatever the Lederberg dictates and I

264.849 --> 267.96999999999997
was

265.15 --> 271.53999999999996
able to control my dreams somehow I knew

267.97 --> 273.04
I was dreaming halfway into the dream so

271.54 --> 275.74
the dream I remember really well and

273.04 --> 277.72
then I toll I wait wait I mean it like I

275.74 --> 280.09000000000003
never been in this place like how how

277.72 --> 281.77000000000004
there I never got bought this clothes or

280.09 --> 284.04999999999995
these shoes you know and I was never

281.77 --> 286.63
able to jump this far so I was able to

284.05 --> 289.66
somehow control my dreams but then I got

286.63 --> 292.09
into trouble either falling or getting

289.66 --> 294.91
into a fight or freaking shooting or

292.09 --> 296.94899999999996
whatever and I like start shaking i woke

294.91 --> 299.62
myself up i never got into that moment

296.949 --> 301.63
when i got either really bad hurt in the

299.62 --> 304.15
dream or something but always the dream

301.63 --> 306.639
ended up bad in a way that i had to wake

304.15 --> 308.73999999999995
myself up so i couldn't I couldn't just

306.639 --> 311.08
continue continue I did that for maybe

308.74 --> 312.699
two three years I mean I stopped it you

311.08 --> 316.65
know why this is because you're

312.699 --> 319.389
basically opposing in your dreams a

316.65 --> 322.419
virtual world created by yourself

319.389 --> 326.97
conscious and it is almost like an ego

322.419 --> 331.12
so if you take control it will object

326.97 --> 333.66900000000004
yeah yeah I refer to it it's funny

331.12 --> 336.699
because there are some movies about

333.669 --> 339.46
dreams and things like what's that

336.699 --> 342.159
famous movie again the infection right

339.46 --> 346.0
with the copyright you movie talk about

342.159 --> 348.13
is very based on real effects that they

346.0 --> 350.919
just science fiction eyes it into

348.13 --> 354.55
multiple layers and all that that's very

350.919 --> 357.31
cool and all but yeah there's fiction

354.55 --> 363.37
eyes it but the basic foundation of what

357.31 --> 366.909
they do yeah it's those things work yeah

363.37 --> 370.0
there's a way to deal with dreams the

366.909 --> 371.11
big sign also of the Robin Williams what

370.0 --> 374.38
dreams may come

371.11 --> 376.84000000000003
yeah yeah yeah when he was no he was a

374.38 --> 380.289
painter so when he died he lived in this

376.84 --> 383.289
awesome fantastic world with colors and

380.289 --> 385.479
running and slippery paintings and then

383.289 --> 387.61
when he went to sleep in his when he was

385.479 --> 389.83
dead when he went to sleep then he dream

387.61 --> 392.47
about being alive you know the slow

389.83 --> 397.9
boring life that man it was interesting

392.47 --> 398.65000000000003
because he is actually dead yeah yeah

397.9 --> 400.419
yeah

398.65 --> 403.919
supposedly I don't know he probably is

400.419 --> 409.04999999999995
that but I really like that guy man

403.919 --> 413.289
Robin Williams he was such a spirited

409.05 --> 417.27000000000004
classical Broadway liberal guy or like a

413.289 --> 420.07
movie it was so good you but he was like

417.27 --> 422.19899999999996
in some way he reminds me a bit of

420.07 --> 424.36
certain characteristics of myself not

422.199 --> 431.1
trying to glorify myself but he is also

424.36 --> 431.1
very tolerant in the sense that he wants

431.16 --> 437.199
he will try to see the good in people

433.36 --> 440.22900000000004
very optimistic so he will overlook bad

437.199 --> 443.38
things well not really bad then he will

440.229 --> 444.82
be depends it's very hard to tell

443.38 --> 446.68
because in his movies he will always

444.82 --> 448.539
stick up for the good principles and

446.68 --> 451.03000000000003
very likely that in the actual Hollywood

448.539 --> 453.49
world you will have to overlook a lot of

451.03 --> 457.17999999999995
[ __ ] because a lot of his colleagues are

453.49 --> 459.07
just nasty people he did a few movies

457.18 --> 461.86
that were not very recognized and I

459.07 --> 464.44
still feel a few of them like I think

461.86 --> 466.63
was one called the photo our men or the

464.44 --> 468.34
our Foreman and something like that it

466.63 --> 471.639
was a photographer it was a little dark

468.34 --> 473.5
kind of a thriller mystery movie it was

471.639 --> 475.87
really good I think he did the B

473.5 --> 478.27
Centennial man when he was a robot and

475.87 --> 481.72
he wanted to be he recognized as a human

478.27 --> 487.96
or whatever he lives like 200 years 90s

481.72 --> 490.69000000000005
movies Wow yeah I forget sometimes you

487.96 --> 493.0
forget about those yeah I don't know how

490.69 --> 494.8
we talked about rolling my robbing

493.0 --> 495.61
willies well yeah it's cool yeah random

494.8 --> 499.90000000000003
subjects right

495.61 --> 503.289
he was a good actor very spirited

499.9 --> 505.659
Pleasant actor although sometimes yeah

503.289 --> 511.63
his attention attention-grabbing 'us

505.659 --> 513.01
kind of gets like okay okay yeah and

511.63 --> 516.25
then there's the point at the end when

513.01 --> 517.75
he is no longer with us he apparently he

516.25 --> 519.88
killed himself you know that's you know

517.75 --> 521.469
it's kind of evidence of that but the

519.88 --> 523.719
reasons that's kind of their little

521.469 --> 525.49
sketchy part like was he depressed was

523.719 --> 527.35
he in some kind of a trouble you know

525.49 --> 529.9300000000001
with somebody so he's that's one to

527.35 --> 532.5500000000001
interpretation you know now this guy was

529.93 --> 536.54
always depressed and he used comedy

532.55 --> 538.16
- basically escape that that is a way to

536.54 --> 540.65
deal with that but yeah he was very

538.16 --> 545.48
depressed naturally and sensitive and

540.65 --> 548.9
that's very dangerous combination so but

545.48 --> 552.1700000000001
yeah I don't know why he would do it

548.9 --> 554.72
right then maybe he was just like

552.17 --> 558.26
feeling too much like he was getting old

554.72 --> 561.4100000000001
and he couldn't maintain what he was

558.26 --> 563.15
doing any longer he faked his dead and

561.41 --> 564.62
they took him to the Idol Republic to

563.15 --> 571.34
make people laugh in the other side of

564.62 --> 576.5
the pond boom I hope you're right

571.34 --> 583.58
because yeah he's a great guy so and he

576.5 --> 586.85
would actually he would attempt to bring

583.58 --> 589.4000000000001
some humanity into things if he was

586.85 --> 592.0400000000001
there yeah yeah he was a character of

589.4 --> 594.11
his own in the interviews on standard

592.04 --> 596.0
arming on day what night shows talk

594.11 --> 598.49
shows and stuff he goes him gets invited

596.0 --> 601.58
he was all over the place always thought

598.49 --> 603.5
it was cool you know yeah I was anyway

601.58 --> 605.5400000000001
talking about dreams man I've been

603.5 --> 608.63
watching so many movies recently that

605.54 --> 610.1899999999999
are about dreams and alternate the

608.63 --> 617.39
dimensions there are so many out there

610.19 --> 619.7900000000001
now it's crazy was this heavy might have

617.39 --> 621.9499999999999
heard of it I don't know how famous this

619.79 --> 627.26
is I think it was rated pretty pretty

621.95 --> 630.1400000000001
decent seven in heaven and it's like

627.26 --> 631.79
very basic like there's just some group

630.14 --> 633.41
of partying guys it's kind of funny

631.79 --> 635.74
because they also deal with like

633.41 --> 638.63
partying versus police and everything in

635.74 --> 641.3
it yeah it really becomes like its own

638.63 --> 644.95
subplot line in that movie but it's

641.3 --> 647.5699999999999
basically about this weird closet and

644.95 --> 649.88
they just play a game with it and then

647.57 --> 651.95
people that sit in it for 7 minutes

649.88 --> 653.72
disappear and it's like a big mystery as

651.95 --> 656.84
to how that happens and they end up in

653.72 --> 660.26
like a parallel dimension that is so

656.84 --> 662.3000000000001
much like the dark world it's crazy but

660.26 --> 666.03
literally like it is all dark

662.3 --> 668.3399999999999
people are more greedy and

666.03 --> 671.3399999999999
eventually figures out like well this

668.34 --> 674.5400000000001
these are kind of like my imaginings and

671.34 --> 677.88
it's all based on his worst fears it's

674.54 --> 682.02
very interesting and the experience of

677.88 --> 684.51
it what's really fascinating yeah I

682.02 --> 686.64
never heard of it some of these movies I

684.51 --> 689.01
think is more important and I I have

686.64 --> 691.62
never done is fine

689.01 --> 693.33
on who the writer the movie star to see

691.62 --> 695.1
why they are coming from where they come

693.33 --> 698.3100000000001
up with the story you know if it was a

695.1 --> 700.08
dream I thought a little you know right

698.31 --> 702.4799999999999
there's a lot of people experimenting

700.08 --> 706.47
out there with several layers of quality

702.48 --> 708.4200000000001
movie and it's interesting yeah there's

706.47 --> 710.7900000000001
all there's not just the blockbuster

708.42 --> 714.24
movies there's a lot of movies out there

710.79 --> 716.8499999999999
and some are terrible and somebody you

714.24 --> 719.4
know trysting ly terrible and others are

716.85 --> 721.59
just really basic but still surprisingly

719.4 --> 723.4499999999999
good and everything it's oh talking

721.59 --> 726.7800000000001
about this you know what was interesting

723.45 --> 730.44
today I got I'm subscribed to two or

726.78 --> 733.98
three sites on movie trailers upcoming

730.44 --> 736.59
movies now one of those sites is like

733.98 --> 738.72
for documentaries and like low-budget

736.59 --> 741.09
movies and give me a bunch of previous

738.72 --> 743.13
of the indie movies and a lot of weird

741.09 --> 746.49
stuff right and today I was scrolling

743.13 --> 748.53
and I said like be behind the curve was

746.49 --> 751.6800000000001
the documentary with margin and Patricia

748.53 --> 752.88
the new one be behind the curve or

751.68 --> 754.8299999999999
something like that what every score he

752.88 --> 757.26
said behind the curve official trailer

754.83 --> 758.97
now and I didn't know it was from the

757.26 --> 761.64
website the official website of the

758.97 --> 763.4
movies and I clicked on it and they show

761.64 --> 767.01
the whole trailer and at the end it says

763.4 --> 769.62
available on Google Play and whatever

767.01 --> 772.2
stores you know like he on iTunes on

769.62 --> 773.91
iTunes and Google Play in today's item

772.2 --> 776.19
from now one day or today so now it's

773.91 --> 778.56
gonna be available to I don't know rent

776.19 --> 780.5400000000001
download or whatever to god I check on

778.56 --> 783.4799999999999
the website and it's official so I guess

780.54 --> 785.1899999999999
iTunes and Google they took care of

783.48 --> 787.08
their movie and they're getting a little

785.19 --> 789.5100000000001
money out of it and that trailer was

787.08 --> 791.82
posted maybe five hours ago so it's a

789.51 --> 793.68
new thing we were waiting on what were

791.82 --> 795.9000000000001
they gonna do with that documentary if

793.68 --> 798.9599999999999
Netflix was gonna take it cable TV or

795.9 --> 803.279
whatever so I guess yeah I guess Google

798.96 --> 807.33
google-owned in there well we gotta be

803.279 --> 809.82
careful with our dependency on Google

807.33 --> 812.279
like even specific groups that are

809.82 --> 816.36
cooperative with Flat Earth I don't know

812.279 --> 821.04
how like the other branches of self

816.36 --> 823.92
making video social media deal with Flat

821.04 --> 826.17
Earth but I do know that if we come from

823.92 --> 828.18
overly dependent on like one company

826.17 --> 830.52
like Google especially Google now which

828.18 --> 835.7399999999999
is in a lot of trouble basically for

830.52 --> 839.5799999999999
censorship that if they get handled by

835.74 --> 841.92
government that we might also be

839.58 --> 845.73
suddenly shunned for some reason because

841.92 --> 848.37
of this good so that's we shouldn't be

845.73 --> 852.0500000000001
dependent all on one big company even

848.37 --> 854.76
though they are they seem to cooperate

852.05 --> 856.4399999999999
yes II think the thing I want to see I

854.76 --> 859.5889999999999
mean I heard a lot of talks about this

856.44 --> 861.99
documentary he say hate piece is a part

859.589 --> 864.0290000000001
of the undocumented but it is what it is

861.99 --> 865.89
I seen the previous I heard the guys you

864.029 --> 867.3
know they mark talked about it and I

865.89 --> 869.3389999999999
repertory should talk about it's playing

867.3 --> 871.1999999999999
the whole thing it's not a flood

869.339 --> 872.85
documentaries for beginners it's just to

871.2 --> 874.7700000000001
put the idea out there I understand the

872.85 --> 877.35
concept I like to see it if it's like

874.77 --> 879.3
maybe dollar ninety-nine to buy a time

877.35 --> 881.37
freaking Google Play I'll buy it I want

879.3 --> 882.75
to see it in good quality so yeah I love

881.37 --> 884.25
my wife like hey let's watch this you

882.75 --> 886.8
know some of the clarity that I'd

884.25 --> 888.45
recognize on the YouTube so it's cool

886.8 --> 891.0889999999999
stuff you know Alice is available for

888.45 --> 893.1
everybody to see criticized or not it's

891.089 --> 895.0200000000001
gonna be feedback he's gonna be taking

893.1 --> 900.9
it up it's gonna be seen by a lot of

895.02 --> 906.329
people it's yet more exposure so yeah

900.9 --> 908.79
good glad it's moving on oh yeah by the

906.329 --> 913.3199999999999
way talking about movies still movies

908.79 --> 916.38
system movie half hour and I saw another

913.32 --> 919.7700000000001
movie yesterday and it was really creepy

916.38 --> 923.8389999999999
it was like a thriller or are not so

919.77 --> 928.529
science fiction concept conceptual as

923.839 --> 931.2900000000001
772 in seven in heaven but yeah this

928.529 --> 932.73
stuff was like seriously a cult

931.29 --> 936.28
freemason

932.73 --> 939.76
what he suggested it was very

936.28 --> 944.6999999999999
interesting movie it's called

939.76 --> 948.37
alt R and earlier yeah it's about like a

944.7 --> 950.95
freemason house that's been cursed so

948.37 --> 954.04
people say and they think it's kind of a

950.95 --> 957.1500000000001
spook movie with ghosts and really

954.04 --> 962.56
interestingly done they use like a

957.15 --> 964.63
kaleidoscopic image like you would in

962.56 --> 967.3599999999999
the presence of these ghosts it's almost

964.63 --> 971.05
like you would automatically see crossed

967.36 --> 975.1
eye you can see them focused it's genius

971.05 --> 978.5799999999999
it's absolutely terrifying very

975.1 --> 981.76
terrifying I recommend if you like

978.58 --> 985.1500000000001
thrillers or it not so gory but like

981.76 --> 987.9399999999999
series goes thrillers yeah man this

985.15 --> 991.77
movie and oh whoa like the iconic

987.94 --> 995.5
the iconography Rosicrucians and

991.77 --> 996.85
freemasons and it's very suggestive I

995.5 --> 998.89
think a lot of people in flat earth

996.85 --> 1002.3100000000001
would appreciate this movie if they

998.89 --> 1005.97
appreciate thrillers very interesting

1002.31 --> 1008.7299999999999
movie to watch so all the time let me

1005.97 --> 1010.4100000000001
see I think it was movies is good I mean

1008.73 --> 1012.96
once you know where you've - you know

1010.41 --> 1020.4599999999999
you know is is sort of a story spent a

1012.96 --> 1022.08
season 14 okay so yeah yeah I get this

1020.46 --> 1025.1100000000001
up and downs because I never watch TV

1022.08 --> 1028.68
but movies I like every few days I just

1025.11 --> 1030.57
plot a movie and yeah science fiction

1028.68 --> 1032.76
horror whatever it costs a lot of

1030.57 --> 1034.6799999999998
science fiction movies I do the visuals

1032.76 --> 1039.84
are starting so yeah it's good stuff

1034.68 --> 1046.3200000000002
oh yeah no budget space movies recently

1039.84 --> 1048.6599999999999
sorry do you watch any theories nope not

1046.32 --> 1053.1
a big fun not a big fan of series at all

1048.66 --> 1055.3200000000002
well I might be but I don't have any

1053.1 --> 1056.48
good sources for free downloads on that

1055.32 --> 1061.5
kind of stuff

1056.48 --> 1064.63
Game of Thrones I had followed it but as

1061.5 --> 1067.66
I said my sources

1064.63 --> 1069.8500000000001
like I used to use pirate way and it's

1067.66 --> 1073.45
so completely blocked like that type of

1069.85 --> 1076.0
open downloading platform or the

1073.45 --> 1078.49
torrents platform just doesn't you can't

1076.0 --> 1080.14
find it anymore that's just a couple of

1078.49 --> 1083.32
the bitter the bitter thing about

1080.14 --> 1085.66
theories is when you draw it out you you

1083.32 --> 1088.72
go through each little you know like

1085.66 --> 1092.47
bump with each character know what I

1088.72 --> 1093.04
mean is that terrible a fantastic Game

1092.47 --> 1099.64
of Thrones

1093.04 --> 1103.6599999999999
yeah very very medieval yeah but like

1099.64 --> 1106.179
brutal for an episode evil they take

1103.66 --> 1107.5900000000001
time in the episode on day the accent

1106.179 --> 1109.15
you know one character different

1107.59 --> 1111.22
characters in the episodes and you get

1109.15 --> 1113.3200000000002
to grow you know to recognize to know

1111.22 --> 1116.41
the character needs to like him and I

1113.32 --> 1119.8899999999999
hate him yet that's better than just a

1116.41 --> 1122.89
movie because it's like and george RR

1119.89 --> 1125.26
martin borrows a lot from history so if

1122.89 --> 1126.7
you spread it through a series it's much

1125.26 --> 1129.0
better than the movie you know what i

1126.7 --> 1131.5
mean it's better than a two-hour for

1129.0 --> 1133.69
right have you also noticed that if

1131.5 --> 1135.76
characters are basically two likable

1133.69 --> 1139.6000000000001
it's a very good chance they're gonna

1135.76 --> 1142.57
die yeah it is so evil

1139.6 --> 1143.26
like I know distich the maker is a

1142.57 --> 1146.98
sadist

1143.26 --> 1150.429
I still miss Marjorie the first two

1146.98 --> 1154.3600000000001
seasons like I I was like violently

1150.429 --> 1155.98
outraged on earth and I just like screw

1154.36 --> 1161.35
this I'm not gonna watch this anymore

1155.98 --> 1163.54
for like five six years true didn't but

1161.35 --> 1168.1
the rest was pretty pretty cool that's

1163.54 --> 1171.34
brilliant a favorite show I used to

1168.1 --> 1171.82
watch a lot of wild earnest but reality

1171.34 --> 1175.4199999999998
shows

1171.82 --> 1177.8799999999999
survivor and while I know whatever you

1175.42 --> 1181.66
know surviving in the whatever naked and

1177.88 --> 1184.6000000000001
afraid and man vs. wild stuff like that

1181.66 --> 1185.8600000000001
they very grills serious awesome and I

1184.6 --> 1187.59
think it's that I've been watching them

1185.86 --> 1191.9199999999998
in a while but they're really good here

1187.59 --> 1194.74
indeed they had can be fun

1191.92 --> 1196.68
I use them watch a lot of television but

1194.74 --> 1200.19
nowadays

1196.68 --> 1202.14
I don't know since Alex Jones already

1200.19 --> 1206.5800000000002
like lost my taste because he already

1202.14 --> 1209.3100000000002
harped on basic like it's all ecology

1206.58 --> 1211.32
and distractions from real problems and

1209.31 --> 1213.9299999999998
that kind of took it away and then

1211.32 --> 1216.6299999999999
flatter ahead and now I just really I

1213.93 --> 1218.3700000000001
can't stand was the update on Alex Jones

1216.63 --> 1220.6200000000001
as for right now I haven't heard of him

1218.37 --> 1222.78
since he was gone I seem to like to

1220.62 --> 1224.2199999999998
video somebody put interviews with him

1222.78 --> 1226.8
or something but I never was the actual

1224.22 --> 1229.77
interviews I made I think he made one or

1226.8 --> 1234.18
two little appearances somewhere but the

1229.77 --> 1238.35
show is done right no nothing for worse

1234.18 --> 1240.63
Alex Jones is still going yeah okay so

1238.35 --> 1248.52
yeah I'm not keeping up with that the

1240.63 --> 1254.7
arrow he's still going and yeah it's

1248.52 --> 1256.32
very very politicized a lot and it's not

1254.7 --> 1258.3600000000001
where it used to be but it's still

1256.32 --> 1260.1599999999999
interesting and still he still does

1258.36 --> 1262.53
amusing sketches sometimes although

1260.16 --> 1265.26
sometimes it seems to be a little bit

1262.53 --> 1267.45
desperate to be funny with certain

1265.26 --> 1270.6299999999999
things sometimes it is funny and but

1267.45 --> 1273.39
then again they like constantly repeat

1270.63 --> 1275.48
these scenes over and over and over

1273.39 --> 1280.8300000000002
again and then just loses its appeal

1275.48 --> 1282.93
it's I don't know they really they aim

1280.83 --> 1284.9099999999999
more for people that don't have a long

1282.93 --> 1289.41
attention span I guess not they're

1284.91 --> 1291.0900000000001
hardcore followers as much cause I like

1289.41 --> 1293.6000000000001
the rhythm I just want to hit everyone

1291.09 --> 1296.01
with the idea the second you come in and

1293.6 --> 1298.83
they don't realize that people that

1296.01 --> 1300.75
listen constantly are just constantly

1298.83 --> 1304.23
being hit with that [ __ ] over and over

1300.75 --> 1306.72
again and it's really tiresome

1304.23 --> 1309.42
eventually I like the remixes of his

1306.72 --> 1311.1000000000001
rant and the little songs like the bone

1309.42 --> 1313.8300000000002
broth under the dmt

1311.1 --> 1315.36
the deity it's funny it's hilarious yeah

1313.83 --> 1318.35
that was amazing he doesn't do that

1315.36 --> 1322.8899999999999
anymore you renamed the product and

1318.35 --> 1324.75
issues with some smart people they take

1322.89 --> 1328.41
clips of whatever you say and they put a

1324.75 --> 1330.21
beat on it and they bro is he arias the

1328.41 --> 1334.5
bomb brought it was really good

1330.21 --> 1336.3
mm-hmm yeah awesome hey you like my

1334.5 --> 1338.52
little intro video I made a little video

little videos together app screen so

1445.63 --> 1451.0600000000002
yeah just took a little snippet of each

1447.88 --> 1453.3700000000001
one I blended them together and then I

1451.06 --> 1455.8
put some music in top of it fading at

1453.37 --> 1461.4299999999998
the end yeah just little creation you

1455.8 --> 1465.9099999999999

1465.91 --> 1470.1100000000001
phone for the mobile phone there's my

1467.41 --> 1472.0600000000002
computer you delta-t yeah that sucks I

1470.11 --> 1478.6599999999999
would suck I'm very glad I have a decent

1472.06 --> 1480.28
PC makes it a lot easier yeah to deal

1478.66 --> 1482.92
with these videos from the cameras and

1480.28 --> 1484.72
stuff I got it unplug the SD plug it on

1482.92 --> 1487.1200000000001
my phone and then just go through them

1484.72 --> 1490.3600000000001

1491.89 --> 1495.7800000000002
little hassle but it's all right there

1496.68 --> 1503.8
so if you had a laptop it would be much

1499.63 --> 1505.8100000000002
easier to interface that oh yeah yeah

1503.8 --> 1507.85
big-time yeah I still can't afford it

1585.89 --> 1589.7900000000002
one you know I'm happy with it it's

1587.75 --> 1592.79
gonna stay there until I come up with a

1589.79 --> 1595.07
new idea maybe a little more you know ha

1592.79 --> 1596.87
ha maybe flashy no pictures different

1595.07 --> 1599.57
setup or the pictures but it's not a bad

1596.87 --> 1603.6789999999999
yeah I'm happy with it I liked the quad

1599.57 --> 1605.1699999999998
split screen with the different footages

1603.679 --> 1614.39
that was very cool

1605.17 --> 1617.059
Europe like that that you could even

1614.39 --> 1621.14
like split it up or zoom in or zoom out

1617.059 --> 1624.11
I mean and like like a giant screen full

1621.14 --> 1626.8400000000001
of mini screens all these flat footages

1624.11 --> 1629.8999999999999
all mixed in it yeah yeah that could be

1626.84 --> 1631.73
cool and then for the outro you know 4

1629.9 --> 1635.45
days more Randy's Department because he

1631.73 --> 1639.25
actually does have so much footage yeah

1635.45 --> 1641.42
footage for for like a thousand blocks

1639.25 --> 1644.059
yeah then at the end I did a little

1641.42 --> 1647.0900000000001
outro maybe like 5 seconds with a little

1644.059 --> 1650.74
flashing letters like muchas gracias and

1647.09 --> 1650.74
boom in the middle you know flashing

2125.49 --> 2130.109
well I'm trying to head out to the same

2127.47 --> 2132.5099999999998
spot I was yesterday to see what what it

2130.109 --> 2134.5789999999997
looks like this morning that's good I

2132.51 --> 2137.7900000000004
saw the foolish you uploaded the wrong

2134.579 --> 2141.71
one really good stuff yeah that was a

2137.79 --> 2141.71
nightmare to try to edit that stuff

2146.59 --> 2150.1600000000003
so so Jose what was that app that you

2148.87 --> 2152.0699999999997
used for your intro because I thought

2150.16 --> 2155.98
that was incredible

2152.07 --> 2159.4300000000003
well I say I used it three apps I used

2155.98 --> 2162.1
one app to do the Jose JG Gonzalez like

2159.43 --> 2163.81
sparkling lights and flashings and I

2162.1 --> 2166.0899999999997
just caught the little piece and I say

2163.81 --> 2169.39
that and maybe six or seven seconds

2166.09 --> 2172.78
video then I another app I download it

2169.39 --> 2175.5699999999997
is to put four video screens in the same

2172.78 --> 2177.94
screen you know so I choose my little

2175.57 --> 2180.01
four videos I took a little snippet of

2177.94 --> 2182.32
the video for a few seconds I'll save it

2180.01 --> 2184.3900000000003
and then I use another one to put a

2182.32 --> 2186.5800000000004
bunch of pictures together you know and

2184.39 --> 2189.3399999999997
it did by yourself they fading in and

2186.58 --> 2191.7999999999997
out and they opened down and then I mash

2189.34 --> 2195.6400000000003
him all together using the you recorded

2191.8 --> 2197.86
I put I speech the videos together the

2195.64 --> 2198.67
three videos back-to-back and then I had

2197.86 --> 2202.1800000000003
this sound

2198.67 --> 2204.07
you like the free youtube music on yeah

2202.18 --> 2205.81
well it took me a little time little

2204.07 --> 2207.7000000000003
thinking like let me see how am I gonna

2205.81 --> 2209.35
do these to make it smooth you know it

2207.7 --> 2209.6499999999996
worked out it looks great yeah it looks

2209.35 --> 2212.35
great

2209.65 --> 2215.4700000000003
hey yeah just send me send me the the

2212.35 --> 2219.0699999999997
names of those those apps in the in the

2215.47 --> 2222.3999999999996
Skype chat now see what I can do it for

2219.07 --> 2226.59
myself definitely yes I'll do that

2222.4 --> 2226.59
little later and appreciate it thanks

2233.21 --> 2239.53
so yeah you know they yesterday no sorry

2239.589 --> 2243.19
you were saying

2245.29 --> 2252.5589999999997
so I've been listening to the like the

2248.72 --> 2255.1899999999996
simulcast that was weird like I even

2252.559 --> 2258.349
tried to like play the video

2255.19 --> 2262.28
simultaneously even synchronized it's

2258.349 --> 2267.339
just it was funny but what was the

2262.28 --> 2269.02
podcast yesterday oh final stream yeah

2267.339 --> 2271.839
just weird

2269.02 --> 2274.64
still good conversations and everything

2271.839 --> 2278.5099999999998
but almost like radio like got

2274.64 --> 2283.9
interrupted because of all the extra

2278.51 --> 2287.2700000000004
stuff but it was funny anyway let's not

2283.9 --> 2288.849
stay silent we still got at least 20

2287.27 --> 2292.25
more minutes

2288.849 --> 2294.77
well so I was shooting Mars last night

2292.25 --> 2297.319
and I was just trying and I think I

2294.77 --> 2303.89
guess you can help me think through this

2297.319 --> 2305.869
so Venus and Mars are between supposedly

2303.89 --> 2310.91
Ryan allegedly the Earth and the Sun

2305.869 --> 2313.369
correct no Mars is one step Mars isn't

2310.91 --> 2317.93
one thing Mars is okay so Mars is on the

2313.369 --> 2323.21
other side of us yes because I was

2317.93 --> 2325.5789999999997
trying to think of why right Venus looks

2323.21 --> 2327.799
so much different than Mars does when

2325.579 --> 2330.53
you know so you've got that almost it's

2327.799 --> 2335.63
almost like the Crescent on Venus at

2330.53 --> 2337.25
times right and then Mars just simply

2335.63 --> 2339.5
looks like a star

2337.25 --> 2344.839
when I was when I was capturing it but

2339.5 --> 2347.859
Venus looks like something different and

2344.839 --> 2351.23
I was just like thinking through those

2347.859 --> 2352.97
different aspects cuz if Venus has a

2351.23 --> 2355.359
crescent then you almost think of Venus

2352.97 --> 2358.04
as a moon so to speak if it's the same

2355.359 --> 2359.96
motif that the sun is shining on Venus

2358.04 --> 2361.29
and you got crescent and all of that

2359.96 --> 2363.81
stuff

2361.29 --> 2365.16
hmm so we're just trying to think

2363.81 --> 2365.97
through the different the different

2365.16 --> 2369.93
phenomenon

2365.97 --> 2371.91
well Venus is kind of an odd phenomena

2369.93 --> 2379.29
on its own because it is also the

2371.91 --> 2382.98
morning star that is bizarrely bright so

2379.29 --> 2388.59
yeah you know the planets are big

2382.98 --> 2390.09
mystery as to what is that why I mean

2388.59 --> 2392.73
Venus right now looks like it's an

2390.09 --> 2395.25
airliner approaching with its huge head

2392.73 --> 2400.5
light coming at us it's its immense

2395.25 --> 2403.44
right now yeah Venus in the morning is

2400.5 --> 2405.36
incredibly bright and then Polaris I

2403.44 --> 2408.09
found because my grandparents are up in

2405.36 --> 2409.59
the hills of California there's no

2408.09 --> 2412.46
lights out there so the stars are just

2409.59 --> 2414.98
lit up like crazy but Polaris is

2412.46 --> 2417.81
indistinguishable unless you know where

2414.98 --> 2421.68
hersa minor is you know it's not like

2417.81 --> 2423.24
this significant star that stands out

2421.68 --> 2425.31
any different than any of the others it

2423.24 --> 2427.2299999999996
just happens to be a very it is part of

2425.31 --> 2431.04
the globe of the heavens just happens to

2427.23 --> 2434.01
be on that point but it's not like as

2431.04 --> 2435.8
it's not separate like the planets it is

2434.01 --> 2439.26
a separate phenomena because planets

2435.8 --> 2443.57
that least Venus can be seen in the

2439.26 --> 2443.57
daylight and stars and on

2447.96 --> 2454.53
yep

2450.43 --> 2454.5299999999997
it is weird I don't know why

2459.46 --> 2464.02
I won't quiet for a minute I'm setting

2461.5 --> 2466.23
up the dogs my my puppies I got a

2464.02 --> 2469.12
walking around sir I believe in him

2466.23 --> 2472.33
would be you know what it would actually

2469.12 --> 2475.9
be kind of fascinating and that I think

2472.33 --> 2479.83
about it that while earlier or many

2475.9 --> 2481.9900000000002
times I've said okay if you go in a fast

2479.83 --> 2483.7599999999998
plane and actually fly to work the Sun

2481.99 --> 2487.5099999999998
under moon is just gonna keep on bending

2483.76 --> 2489.67
away staying at the same distance but

2487.51 --> 2492.5800000000004
how does that actually work with the

2489.67 --> 2498.4
planets I really wonder what happens if

2492.58 --> 2499.0
you go towards Venus when it is

2498.4 --> 2502.6
brightest

2499.0 --> 2504.43
is it then yeah technically Venus when

2502.6 --> 2506.62
it is brightest is when it is followed

2504.43 --> 2508.96
up by the Sun so if you're gonna go that

2506.62 --> 2510.4
way then you're gonna get into the

2508.96 --> 2513.16
sunrise and Venus will probably

2510.4 --> 2515.29
disappear right it's gonna get swallowed

2513.16 --> 2517.48
up well I can I can I think it's gonna

2515.29 --> 2518.71
be drowned out by the day yeah I can

2517.48 --> 2520.6
give you some footage this morning as

2518.71 --> 2523.81
soon as I set up on the beach because

2520.6 --> 2527.38
it's like I said it's right there I'm

2523.81 --> 2531.82
just very interested like do the planets

2527.38 --> 2534.1600000000003
have the same holographic aspects that

2531.82 --> 2539.6200000000003
they will Bend away from you if you try

2534.16 --> 2542.41
to pursue them directly I would imagine

2539.62 --> 2547.42
if they are gonna be the same the same

2542.41 --> 2551.25
stuff as isn't just being lights it's so

2547.42 --> 2551.25
odd that they have such a different path

2551.3 --> 2557.96
as wandering stars because the Sun and

2555.29 --> 2560.3
the moon have a very distinct path this

2557.96 --> 2564.05
the Stars the glow of the heavens have a

2560.3 --> 2570.6400000000003
very distinct set path but the planets

2564.05 --> 2570.6400000000003
seem to be just doing their own thing

2570.67 --> 2575.66
wandering

2572.26 --> 2578.2400000000002
yeah wandering stars indeed but it's not

2575.66 --> 2586.31
just stars because yeah star fades out

2578.24 --> 2588.3799999999997
during the day now I was in before but

2586.31 --> 2591.56
then I dropped when I'm when I'm at work

2588.38 --> 2602.3
my signal was not the greatest so but

2591.56 --> 2605.21
I've been listening so you saw I sent

2602.3 --> 2612.52
you that mp3 that's my newest my newest

2605.21 --> 2616.4
karaoke version Oh God sorry no I I

2612.52 --> 2618.65
covered Bruce Springsteen's born to run

2616.4 --> 2623.78
I changed the words and called it for

2618.65 --> 2628.9700000000003
born to scam and it's all about calling

2623.78 --> 2631.07
out NASA I'll check it out and I just I

2628.97 --> 2633.4399999999996
heard it put in Skype but didn't this

2631.07 --> 2636.23
guy pan out like that yeah it's pretty

2633.44 --> 2639.9500000000003
soon you're gonna have a CD man I know

2636.23 --> 2641.0
right I think I'm gonna debut it at the

2639.95 --> 2642.68
conference because they're supposed to

2641.0 --> 2644.06
have a karaoke session so I think I'm

2642.68 --> 2647.24
just gonna bust out with Bruce

2644.06 --> 2651.13
Springsteen oh yeah you are go all right

2647.24 --> 2651.1299999999997
damn I wish I was going to that country

2652.47 --> 2658.2599999999998
I see it now yeah I'll play that little

2655.29 --> 2660.93
later or you want me to debate it on the

2658.26 --> 2661.829
show no I do whatever you want I was

2660.93 --> 2663.75
just sending it to you because that's

2661.829 --> 2669.4100000000003
what I yeah I'm gonna do put it on the

2663.75 --> 2679.099
show you do that I'll check it out

2669.41 --> 2679.0989999999997
Thanks so

2693.27 --> 2701.85
I'm just really curious about what you

2697.23 --> 2706.89
guys are most prepared for in your mind

2701.85 --> 2713.31
if you would go to the Antarctic place

2706.89 --> 2717.21
and what would you expect what if it

2713.31 --> 2721.07
actually turns out to be an island like

2717.21 --> 2723.6
how what would that make you think

2721.07 --> 2726.8700000000003
knowing that it is flat what would

2723.6 --> 2732.81
happen I don't know these hypotheticals

2726.87 --> 2736.58
are just so non concrete for me but it

2732.81 --> 2739.14
is branching out what could happen

2736.58 --> 2743.12
basically we have to be prepared for

2739.14 --> 2748.5299999999997
anything for a potentially surreal world

2743.12 --> 2750.7799999999997
step away from the model and figure out

2748.53 --> 2755.3100000000004
all the possibilities what if this what

2750.78 --> 2762.8700000000003
if that and yeah we've never actually

2755.31 --> 2764.61
been presented with it's not a guy yeah

2762.87 --> 2769.41
but that doesn't mean that Antarctica

2764.61 --> 2770.7000000000003
can be a giant island potentially well

2769.41 --> 2772.6499999999996
you know the one thing for me that I

2770.7 --> 2774.75
that I've thought about I mean this is

2772.65 --> 2779.67
kind of segwaying into something

2774.75 --> 2783.21
different but but anyway whenever we see

2779.67 --> 2787.5
an image of the globe it's always right

2783.21 --> 2792.6
side up so to speak yeah right yeah it's

2787.5 --> 2794.61
but in reality in reality it could be

2792.6 --> 2796.5899999999997
any it could be any direction you know

2794.61 --> 2798.03
so like you know there would be the

2796.59 --> 2801.32
statement about shooting stars whatever

2798.03 --> 2804.3900000000003
we see shooting stars they come down

2801.32 --> 2806.1000000000004
technically they should be coming from

2804.39 --> 2810.0299999999997
any direction because there is no

2806.1 --> 2811.95
direction in space you know so we should

2810.03 --> 2813.9300000000003
be seeing we should be seeing

2811.95 --> 2815.93
indiscriminate images of the earth from

2813.93 --> 2818.1
every single angle they should never

2815.93 --> 2820.1099999999997
manipulate it so that it looks like the

2818.1 --> 2824.1
globe with the North Pole up and the

2820.11 --> 2825.58
South Pole down see I have no doubt the

2824.1 --> 2829.2999999999997
earth is not a globe

2825.58 --> 2834.13
it's very I know this but that doesn't

2829.3 --> 2838.27
mean that we then must exclude certain

2834.13 --> 2840.1600000000003
concepts just because that would again

2838.27 --> 2843.79
suggest the globe as so many things

2840.16 --> 2846.0099999999998
already seems to seem to be doing yeah I

2843.79 --> 2849.82
was trying to work alone I know which

2846.01 --> 2851.71
are the six expect things when we see

2849.82 --> 2854.53
when we see the earth it's always the

2851.71 --> 2856.39
same orientation like the way they say

2854.53 --> 2858.28
oh there's no up or down in space

2856.39 --> 2860.02
everything is relative well why don't we

2858.28 --> 2863.38
ever why aren't we ever presented

2860.02 --> 2865.54
picture these words upside down

2863.38 --> 2866.65
yeah like so so what made me think of

2865.54 --> 2869.08
that Arwen and I wasn't trying to

2866.65 --> 2871.48
correct you in any way at all I was just

2869.08 --> 2873.97
thinking of I was just thinking of being

2871.48 --> 2875.47
upside down in Antarctica when you were

2873.97 --> 2877.12
you were asking okay so what would you

2875.47 --> 2879.85
think about so I was like okay well I

2877.12 --> 2881.92
guess ultimately I would be I would be I

2879.85 --> 2883.96
would be technically 90 degrees upside

2881.92 --> 2886.2400000000002
down so that would be kind of weird and

2883.96 --> 2887.71
then that led me to think about why

2886.24 --> 2891.49
don't we ever see the globe with

2887.71 --> 2892.69
Antarctica on top or on the side so

2891.49 --> 2896.2299999999996
that's where that that's where that

2892.69 --> 2898.36
comment came from no and I think I've

2896.23 --> 2901.3
asked one of the ballers that that very

2898.36 --> 2904.33
questions on a show a while ago two

2901.3 --> 2906.19
months ago and hang them in what there

2904.33 --> 2908.3199999999997
was France Boise that something like oh

2906.19 --> 2914.86
but the satellites always already stated

2908.32 --> 2916.29
certain ways right why haven't I seen no

2914.86 --> 2919.54
upside down city yet

2916.29 --> 2921.55
Wow that pictures taken from the

2919.54 --> 2923.8
satellite that's not completely

2921.55 --> 2925.15
orientated north and south you know well

2923.8 --> 2927.88
that's a lot that's the whole argument

2925.15 --> 2929.5
from someone who who was on I can't

2927.88 --> 2931.96
remember who it was who came on we were

2929.5 --> 2934.57
asking them why do the training manuals

2931.96 --> 2937.66
for flight talk about flying over a

2934.57 --> 2939.6400000000003
level plane and the person said well

2937.66 --> 2942.73
cause it'd be just too complicated to

2939.64 --> 2945.67
talk about I know exactly that was that

2942.73 --> 2950.95
was unorthodox yeah yeah so we just

2945.67 --> 2952.78
talked about it like it is yeah cuz I

2950.95 --> 2955.54
asked that was the question I asked them

2952.78 --> 2957.7900000000004
why do they eat why do pilots are why

2955.54 --> 2958.63
are they taught the simulators are

2957.79 --> 2961.869
always on a flight

2958.63 --> 2964.69
a flat program that they don't they

2961.869 --> 2966.67
don't teach him on a sphere and he said

2964.69 --> 2969.579
oh because it would be too complicated

2966.67 --> 2972.579
to teach the pilot how to fly on the

2969.579 --> 2974.7400000000002
sphere wait a minute oh right if that's

2972.579 --> 2976.42
not if that's what we're on how would

2974.74 --> 2981.339
the district propagate the patient to

2976.42 --> 2985.539
fly on what we're on no like old guy

2981.339 --> 2987.339
really crazy old pilots we can't teach

2985.539 --> 2990.6400000000003
you to fly in a sphere you're just gonna

2987.339 --> 2993.369
have to fly all over a flat plane yeah

2990.64 --> 2996.5789999999997
and work it out hope that gravity works

2993.369 --> 2997.9300000000003
out yeah see the whole thing write the

2996.579 --> 2999.88
whole thing I had that interview with

2997.93 --> 3002.009
the pilot and i'ma like how do you

2999.88 --> 3005.88
account for the curve he's like we don't

3002.009 --> 3008.039
so you don't train so the training

3005.88 --> 3011.369
manual you don't have to train for

3008.039 --> 3013.829
flying over a senior and if that's

3011.369 --> 3016.8900000000003
coming from directly from a pilot so I

3013.829 --> 3019.799
mean come on so a baller that comes in

3016.89 --> 3022.89
on the panel is going to face something

3019.799 --> 3026.13
contrary when the guy actually is taught

3022.89 --> 3028.5
a certain way to fly and he negates that

3026.13 --> 3032.7000000000003
statement come on come on but Gramps has

3028.5 --> 3039.869
been to space he said so oh yeah he's

3032.7 --> 3045.6299999999997
probably from space or something big old

3039.869 --> 3049.609
light roots artistic understandings yeah

3045.63 --> 3053.4
that's what rhombus does a lot but it is

3049.609 --> 3056.5789999999997
it is a like a political stance very

3053.4 --> 3059.789
similar by the way to political stances

3056.579 --> 3065.1600000000003
in actual politics of a certain group

3059.789 --> 3068.3390000000004
but yeah he doesn't really address

3065.16 --> 3071.3689999999997
issues anymore he just goes for full on

3068.339 --> 3081.299
peer pressure mostly with as many utters

3071.369 --> 3086.579
as he can uh try sorry your volume sorry

3081.299 --> 3088.349
no chocolate now I wasn't really trying

3086.579 --> 3091.069
to talk to somebody I would talk to me

3088.349 --> 3091.069
all right

3092.989 --> 3101.039
yeah politicization it's a big problem

3098.059 --> 3115.0190000000002
the only way to deal with it is not to

3101.039 --> 3118.1400000000003
deal with it yeah it is basically a

3115.019 --> 3123.779
giant red herring all of it just like

3118.14 --> 3137.279
rhombuses sure it is red he is a red

3123.779 --> 3140.579
herring with glasses it's not just

3137.279 --> 3142.979
because a map works doesn't mean you

3140.579 --> 3145.289
know like the London Underground map

3142.979 --> 3146.43
works you can't go okay that's proof

3145.289 --> 3148.559
that you're on a ball

3146.43 --> 3150.6299999999997
just because you've made maths to mean

3148.559 --> 3151.9500000000003
something doesn't mean that's what it

3150.63 --> 3157.559
means you know what I mean that's what

3151.95 --> 3161.549
they don't get he's got you said all the

3157.559 --> 3163.4100000000003
time like a troll was saying to me it

3161.549 --> 3164.519
might have been yesterday that well

3163.41 --> 3167.19
longitude

3164.519 --> 3170.069
you know they mean well oh well there

3167.19 --> 3172.68
goes sunrise you know like that's one

3170.069 --> 3175.229
word and hey and they've twisted that

3172.68 --> 3177.5989999999997
reason for why it's it's a sphere you

3175.229 --> 3180.089
know I have so many presuppositions to

3177.599 --> 3182.9990000000003
choose your it's it's all just nonsense

3180.089 --> 3184.819
in the details it's all other

3182.999 --> 3189.1189999999997
presuppositions it's a giant

3184.819 --> 3195.14
presupposition fairy tale that's our

3189.119 --> 3199.039
presuppositional presupposition of

3195.14 --> 3200.64
heavenly body physical literalism and

3199.039 --> 3203.6090000000004
anything in between

3200.64 --> 3207.859
literally yeah a guy like you know like

3203.609 --> 3211.619
stars it's all just nonsense

3207.859 --> 3213.749
one word trigger answers let's answer

3211.619 --> 3216.599
today housekeeping questions on Nathan

3213.749 --> 3218.43
with one-word answers from the ballers

3216.599 --> 3221.809
like what's the distance to the Sun

3218.43 --> 3221.8089999999997
trigonometry you know

3223.91 --> 3231.27
now that we have gas pressure micro

3226.35 --> 3233.2999999999997
vacuum gravity yeah I hate every time

3231.27 --> 3236.85
they say that it's so stupid

3233.3 --> 3239.2200000000003
they should know better if you actually

3236.85 --> 3242.67
understand physics even the official

3239.22 --> 3244.77
version it can't work something they

3242.67 --> 3246.57
don't really like it's something the

3244.77 --> 3251.67
real physicists just don't really like

3246.57 --> 3253.8500000000004
to talk about your way all the real

3251.67 --> 3256.71
physicists and all of us

3253.85 --> 3257.67
they're trading their jobs and staying

3256.71 --> 3261.44
out of all this

3257.67 --> 3269.73
yep well then that's I agree with that

3261.44 --> 3271.98
what they're doing yeah shout out today

3269.73 --> 3274.44
to the government agencies on the chat

3271.98 --> 3277.4900000000002
over here silence not typing but they're

3274.44 --> 3287.3
listening thank you for attending

3277.49 --> 3290.3999999999996
attractive right so uh four more minutes

3287.3 --> 3295.05
anything you guys would like to share

3290.4 --> 3301.23
before I round out the show just you if

3295.05 --> 3303.48
they were any hope no go ahead did okay

3301.23 --> 3306.06
if there were any real globe proofs we

3303.48 --> 3312.15
would have seen one or two by now so far

3306.06 --> 3315.66
it's just been nonsense yeah a missing

3312.15 --> 3318.12
purposeful misinterpretation yeah denial
