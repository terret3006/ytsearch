super chat that would be much

76.409 --> 81.03
appreciated

78.02 --> 86.729
so today the weather is kind of similar

81.03 --> 91.979
to yesterday it's still very windy not

86.729 --> 94.8
super clouded still enough and I was

91.979 --> 99.179
looking like this evening or in the

94.8 --> 101.7
night and the wind was so heavy that the

99.179 --> 106.2
moon was there and you could just see

101.7 --> 115.009
the clouds rush by so incredibly fast it

106.2 --> 115.009
was just insane looking anyway

115.73 --> 124.44
yeah lots of heavy winds it's now the

118.11 --> 127.64
fourth or fifth day I think so I got

124.44 --> 127.64
green tea with me

129.09 --> 132.15
[Music]

136.52 --> 145.32000000000002
all right so let's see who is in chat

140.9 --> 148.82
it's a bit quiet still Giulio Pavan was

145.32 --> 153.04999999999998
first over McCoy Amanda you'll a gem

148.82 --> 155.94
George Sandford good to see you

153.05 --> 159.74
alright so yeah yesterday was a lot of

155.94 --> 166.14
activity on YouTube and on D life well

159.74 --> 169.5
yeah evening there was own Benjamin and

166.14 --> 172.85
then suddenly my internet cut out like

169.5 --> 175.59
right around 10 o'clock after damn time

172.85 --> 178.38
just when he started up it's so sucky

175.59 --> 180.99
and yeah I couldn't get I couldn't reset

178.38 --> 183.5
my internet and to wait for another hour

180.99 --> 187.58
and then I missed it yeah so that sucked

183.5 --> 191.7
but later on in the in the late night

187.58 --> 195.09
Jaron went live and he had just this

191.7 --> 197.57999999999998
incredible panel of guests was pretty

195.09 --> 200.459
astounding and like even open Benjamin

197.58 --> 204.72
joined them David Weiss was there and

200.459 --> 209.55
yeah that was pretty impressive a lot of

204.72 --> 214.11
energy there oh yeah and Randy was on

209.55 --> 217.05
there wait it was on Randy's I think or

214.11 --> 219.38000000000002
was it like dual stream I don't remember

217.05 --> 224.22
anyway he was a whole bunch of people

219.38 --> 227.51999999999998
interesting hangout exchanges of

224.22 --> 232.88
experiences in the field and flat earth

227.52 --> 235.8
and yeah so that was pretty good hangout

232.88 --> 240.63
got to listen to most of it in the

235.8 --> 249.3
background ah let's see oh yeah I left a

240.63 --> 251.31
veil who's still still is like is he's

249.3 --> 253.8
like really afraid of the corona fires

251.31 --> 255.959
he pretty much shares it and I don't

253.8 --> 258.06
think it's LARP or anything I think

255.959 --> 260.73
yeah he's genuinely nervous and he

258.06 --> 265.229
doesn't really understand it and very

260.73 --> 266.66
impressive videos out there so ignore

265.229 --> 268.76
fear

266.66 --> 273.29
she's like the woman that fell out of

268.76 --> 277.27
the building that was really tragic but

273.29 --> 280.04
yeah what's the context of that you know

277.27 --> 283.72999999999996
was that person literally afraid of the

280.04 --> 285.44
virus could be you know they have a lot

283.73 --> 287.47
of issues in Asia there and the

285.44 --> 289.96999999999997
government always clap sound so hard

287.47 --> 295.22
maybe she was just more afraid of the

289.97 --> 297.95000000000005
government what they would do to her you

295.22 --> 305.18
know because government is ruthless

297.95 --> 307.52
they're very very ruthless and yeah not

305.18 --> 310.25
saying that that's everything in this

307.52 --> 313.13
sense is just pure destruction

310.25 --> 315.38
you know like Alex Jones would now is

313.13 --> 319.7
typically using the whole scenario to

315.38 --> 324.74
just emphasize that part but you know

319.7 --> 328.37
what is what is this coronavirus really

324.74 --> 331.49
and yeah I've been looking at it from a

328.37 --> 334.49
distance for a long time I've brought my

331.49 --> 336.97
own approach if some of you may remember

334.49 --> 341.21000000000004
I don't know how well this stuff sticks

336.97 --> 347.27000000000004
you know basically disclaiming fired a

341.21 --> 350.27
virus as an as an entity as ascribe to

347.27 --> 357.2
by the medical system officially don't

350.27 --> 362.63
yeah it may be a spell like a spell

357.2 --> 366.919
that's unleashed on people that gets to

362.63 --> 369.5
them emotionally work and it's like it's

366.919 --> 371.96
such a complex thing but I really feel

369.5 --> 375.919
like it is more like a spell than it's

371.96 --> 378.90999999999997
an actual entity that just passes on but

375.919 --> 381.02
they really they laid a focus on that

378.91 --> 383.51000000000005
infectiousness on that danger and

381.02 --> 385.03999999999996
everything to prevent that and that's

383.51 --> 387.32
where the focus lies and it's almost

385.04 --> 390.32
like a spiritual magician's trick by

387.32 --> 393.08
relaying the focus on that you can do

390.32 --> 395.71999999999997
other things that normally people would

393.08 --> 397.60999999999996
take notice of and then they'd be too

395.72 --> 399.01000000000005
distracted to care or they think yeah

397.61 --> 405.43
whatever they need to do

399.01 --> 408.49
because of their obsession yes news

405.43 --> 411.40000000000003
denier that's right no I'm not in a

408.49 --> 415.72
literal sense it's not like we know it

411.4 --> 418.9
is I think there is something okay there

415.72 --> 420.70000000000005
there is there are things in micro plasm

418.9 --> 424.35999999999996
and I've I've been doing doing some

420.7 --> 430.39
digging now I've dug through medical

424.36 --> 432.97
data before and just to try to find some

430.39 --> 434.53
more backup of wolf the entire situation

432.97 --> 437.47
like what is this fire so what does it

434.53 --> 442.39
stand for how was it registered I was it

437.47 --> 448.06
supposed to work and how dangerous is it

442.39 --> 451.09
really and well still is it is it what

448.06 --> 453.76
they say it is or is the the virus that

451.09 --> 458.5
that micro thing is that merely

453.76 --> 460.9
correlative you know because I could

458.5 --> 462.52
model out a different approach just on

460.9 --> 465.42999999999995
the spot purely conceptually Pro

462.52 --> 469.0
improvise so this is medical fiction you

465.43 --> 474.7
could say what if for example a virus

469.0 --> 477.72
would be a body microbiome side-effect

474.7 --> 481.57
that would naturally arrive during the

477.72 --> 483.70000000000005
the metabolic transition period that is

481.57 --> 488.38
typically known as as a cold or disease

483.7 --> 492.64
and yeah it will definitely during such

488.38 --> 497.02
a process spread but it may not be the

492.64 --> 499.15
the core initiator of it you know how do

497.02 --> 501.94
you prove that isn't is it

499.15 --> 503.79999999999995
absolutely that virus only that does it

501.94 --> 507.1
or is it really the psychosomatic

503.8 --> 510.21000000000004
effects of seeing people ill and the

507.1 --> 515.44
fear and how the body responds to that

510.21 --> 517.66
and I want to have I want to have a sort

515.44 --> 519.729
of a fringe medical debate about this

517.66 --> 521.38
with people that actually know what the

519.729 --> 523.21
freakin hell they're talking about so

521.38 --> 528.46
for example at a meek and I want him on

523.21 --> 531.589
this you know it's it's a very tough

528.46 --> 534.019
region to deal with because of

531.589 --> 538.009
the extreme opposition it basically

534.019 --> 539.93
poses towards the medical system so I

538.009 --> 542.42
understand if not a lot of people would

539.93 --> 546.17
like to engage in this type of thinking

542.42 --> 553.67
and speculating because it that is still

546.17 --> 556.49
what it is at this point right but the

553.67 --> 560.389
psychosomatic effects cannot be denied

556.49 --> 562.569
just the panic itself there's people

560.389 --> 567.4590000000001
just seemingly

562.569 --> 571.279
getting in accidents getting killed or

567.459 --> 574.3389999999999
maybe you know have have you ever been

571.279 --> 576.439
in extreme shock situation where you

574.339 --> 579.1700000000001
were suddenly out of nowhere subjected

576.439 --> 582.5889999999999
to brutal violence of some kind and you

579.17 --> 584.0889999999999
don't know what to do like next stream

582.589 --> 586.2790000000001
traumatizing situation where you get

584.089 --> 589.4300000000001
adrenaline potentially and other things

586.279 --> 593.72
and then you crack up well after that

589.43 --> 596.329
kind of [ __ ] you get sick yeah you don't

593.72 --> 598.3090000000001
need any freaking virus or bacteria to

596.329 --> 602.809
get really sick after that well that's a

598.309 --> 605.93
psychosomatic backlash so yeah then

602.809 --> 608.629
that's medically proven you can prove

605.93 --> 611.449
that medically that happens you don't

608.629 --> 612.98
have to be in any kind of you can be

611.449 --> 614.569
perfectly sterile if you're going to be

612.98 --> 618.86
subjected to extreme psychological

614.569 --> 621.25
trauma and violence you will have at

618.86 --> 623.72
some point probably not too long after

621.25 --> 625.25
while depending on how long the pressure

623.72 --> 627.0500000000001
lasts really because when the pressure

625.25 --> 629.389
when you can finally resolve it

627.05 --> 631.37
psychologically that's when the real

629.389 --> 632.99
psychosomatic backlash begins and this

631.37 --> 635.089
is what your inner German new medicine

632.99 --> 637.22
is all about and you don't need any

635.089 --> 639.639
affection but you will get typical

637.22 --> 642.679
disease you will maybe get heavy cold or

639.639 --> 645.199
extreme back depends on the nature of

642.679 --> 647.72
the trauma and this is also what German

645.199 --> 653.3499999999999
new medicine has a chart has developed a

647.72 --> 653.35
chart for to get the precise

654.13 --> 662.319
yeah relations between the psychological

657.819 --> 664.899
effects and the physical type of effect

662.319 --> 670.4799999999999
that will result from that it's very

664.899 --> 672.699
fascinating so yeah if government's

670.48 --> 675.4300000000001
gonna be extremely brutal like suddenly

672.699 --> 678.42
bashing doors drag people from their

675.43 --> 682.4799999999999
lags out and all that [ __ ] and you see

678.42 --> 685.389
yeah presumed bodies packaged carried

682.48 --> 687.4590000000001
around on stretchers by people in hazmat

685.389 --> 691.839
suits it's gonna terrify the [ __ ] out of

687.459 --> 693.79
people especially when they think yeah

691.839 --> 696.19
we don't really know what if that is

693.79 --> 699.2199999999999
real but yeah they could they could just

696.19 --> 702.69
come for me all of a sudden and that may

699.22 --> 704.769
be in some way a realistic fear for them

702.69 --> 708.19
specifically in that country with that

704.769 --> 711.91
type of government so yeah it's gonna

708.19 --> 714.0290000000001
have a lot of trauma backlash and that's

711.91 --> 716.41
what people get really sick from

714.029 --> 722.62
remember so see I have now an

716.41 --> 727.75
alternative framework conception for how

722.62 --> 731.86
these situations happen and it's purely

727.75 --> 735.97
conceptual but I have some empirically

731.86 --> 739.649
based evidence to derive this conception

735.97 --> 739.649
from that is legitimate

743.23 --> 749.3000000000001
and I want to get down into this further

746.06 --> 751.3699999999999
I don't know if I can dispel it you know

749.3 --> 754.519
fear is a powerful spell especially if

751.37 --> 757.819
everything says it it doesn't matter how

754.519 --> 759.829
well you know something is not true like

757.819 --> 762.3499999999999
even if you really if it was constantly

759.829 --> 764.569
just yelled over microphones everywhere

762.35 --> 768.1990000000001
over megaphone everywhere and you could

764.569 --> 771.319
not not hear it you would eventually

768.199 --> 775.3389999999999
become spellbound purely yeah it's

771.319 --> 777.92
mechanical so can I do anything about

775.339 --> 780.4390000000001
this if everybody in the freaking world

777.92 --> 782.4799999999999
starts talking about it every person on

780.439 --> 785.42
social media all the news all the

782.48 --> 789.29
talking show but you know know the

785.42 --> 793.0999999999999
spells gonna be too strong but I can

789.29 --> 795.199
certainly give some people tools as to

793.1 --> 799.1
how to potentially approach this all

795.199 --> 803.149
differently so they them's can work it

799.1 --> 805.8190000000001
out for themselves and potentially work

803.149 --> 809.81
with that knowledge towards a future

805.819 --> 811.79
where enough people could be sensible

809.81 --> 814.25
and spiritually protected against this

811.79 --> 816.769
and prepared because because it's not

814.25 --> 818.93
just the idea of virus or whatever it's

816.769 --> 822.05
also the social effects and what

818.93 --> 824.649
governments do all of this is all part

822.05 --> 827.3599999999999
of the entire spell of the threat that

824.649 --> 831.11
causes the effects that are claimed to

827.36 --> 833.509
be the spread of the virus so what we

831.11 --> 835.25
can all do about this eventually to kind

833.509 --> 838.009
of dispel it is going to be very

835.25 --> 843.769
long-term learning process very complex

838.009 --> 848.42
and it's gonna disillusion a lot of

843.769 --> 852.889
people about the medical system in

848.42 --> 854.8389999999999
general probably because there is yeah

852.889 --> 857.2090000000001
there's just a lot of problems with

854.839 --> 859.399
allopathic approaches to the medical

857.209 --> 861.709
system and not saying that all these

859.399 --> 864.259
doctors you know and especially the

861.709 --> 870.7689999999999
laboratory researchers that do biology

864.259 --> 873.16
I'm not saying that they are liars just

870.769 --> 876.019
be clear I am NOT saying that absolutely

873.16 --> 879.279
not right

876.019 --> 883.16
I'm saying is that they are working and

879.279 --> 886.97
thinking along a train of thought among

883.16 --> 890.0889999999999
a line that was presented to them that

886.97 --> 894.529
is potentially presuppositional in many

890.089 --> 898.2790000000001
ways and not as definitively proven as

894.529 --> 900.499
is generally accepted in the literature

898.279 --> 902.42
that all these doctors get exposed to it

900.499 --> 905.4200000000001
so it becomes second nature to just

902.42 --> 908.3499999999999
follow the presuppositional line they

905.42 --> 912.61
they won't even realize it people

908.35 --> 916.279
underestimate how much knowledge just

912.61 --> 918.559
tangible knowledge is involved in the

916.279 --> 920.899
medical world it's insane

918.559 --> 923.98
what you just have to learn about the

920.899 --> 927.98
body just to become a doctor is

923.98 --> 931.369
staggering it's a huge amount of details

927.98 --> 938.2090000000001
huge and that makes it very difficult

931.369 --> 941.5690000000001
because all that data is there but the

938.209 --> 944.569
conclusions drawn from every part is it

941.569 --> 946.67
really that accurate or has over the

944.569 --> 950.54
last hundred years and before that even

946.67 --> 952.819
much more has it been figured out wait

950.54 --> 955.91
hold on we thought this and that about

952.819 --> 959.6289999999999
certain organs are certain micro are get

955.91 --> 962.209
turned out not to be that right why

959.629 --> 963.9200000000001
would you then presume that the baseline

962.209 --> 965.299
narrative that carries it all all

963.92 --> 969.529
through the medical system that's

965.299 --> 971.54
basically artificially constructed to

969.529 --> 973.549
synchronize everyone's mindset is it

971.54 --> 976.519
makes it easier to communicate because

973.549 --> 977.569
if everybody's constantly not sure about

976.519 --> 979.73
things that is going to be a lot of

977.569 --> 981.529
conflict and it's tough because there's

979.73 --> 982.91
a lot of data to go around if there's a

981.529 --> 985.91
lot of conflict all that data is going

982.91 --> 989.179
to be obstructed so it's gonna make it

985.91 --> 991.279
function less functional it's complex

989.179 --> 993.889
these things it's very complex

991.279 --> 998.269
I might have to re-watch this like twice

993.889 --> 999.5600000000001
or three times myself there's all kinds

998.269 --> 1005.7
of things coming out of it I

999.56 --> 1009.3699999999999
me now but they are not necessarily

1005.7 --> 1013.1400000000001
liars because they do the experiments as

1009.37 --> 1018.25
is told by them proves the things is

1013.14 --> 1021.8199999999999
provides the data that will suffice for

1018.25 --> 1023.529
the system to pay them that's basically

1021.82 --> 1025.689
what's going down and it doesn't mean

1023.529 --> 1027.37
that what they did is fraud you know

1025.689 --> 1029.8600000000001
they're not saying that there isn't any

1027.37 --> 1033.9389999999999
fraud okay there may be some really

1029.86 --> 1036.9389999999999
devious people out there doing creepy

1033.939 --> 1039.3100000000002
[ __ ] but that's not gonna be the

1036.939 --> 1041.74
majority and pretty certain of it so the

1039.31 --> 1044.6499999999999
people that really think like viruses

1041.74 --> 1046.24
but we detect these viruses you know we

1044.65 --> 1049.0900000000001
can see the moment the market let me

1046.24 --> 1053.26
share that I have pictures from electron

1049.09 --> 1055.1799999999998
microscopes of of actual coronaviruses

1053.26 --> 1057.19
with some in-depth explanation and I'll

1055.18 --> 1058.78
just share it with you so there is a

1057.19 --> 1061.92
visual to it

1058.78 --> 1066.8999999999999
it's not completely a hundred percent

1061.92 --> 1066.9
just just imaginary fiction

1083.58 --> 1092.9399999999998
all right

1085.5 --> 1095.309
so yeah look this this is from Center

1092.94 --> 1099.69
for Disease Control prevention these are

1095.309 --> 1102.3899999999999
electron microscope photographs what

1099.69 --> 1104.669
they presumed to be advised this virus

1102.39 --> 1106.6200000000001
and they call it corona virus because of

1104.669 --> 1109.1100000000001
a certain type of a parea

1106.62 --> 1112.1399999999999
how they present themselves but they

1109.11 --> 1116.27
presume is going on in that micro cousin

1112.14 --> 1121.3200000000002
but yeah so there is something there

1116.27 --> 1125.73
there but look you know what is there in

1121.32 --> 1128.1589999999999
the body is is does this is this the

1125.73 --> 1132.71
smallest there is for example really in

1128.159 --> 1137.7600000000002
the bio world you know there it seems

1132.71 --> 1139.38
like webfinger work to me really but

1137.76 --> 1141.419
yeah then there is the correlations that

1139.38 --> 1142.0200000000002
are probably there like Oh virus

1141.419 --> 1149.3090000000002
detected

1142.02 --> 1152.4
the symptoms and I think that that is

1149.309 --> 1154.83
pretty much it but they overlook that

1152.4 --> 1158.159
symptoms also come when there is no

1154.83 --> 1161.789
viruses it's they know this the placebo

1158.159 --> 1166.13
anyway let me switch back they know this

1161.789 --> 1166.1299999999999
with placebo effect

1167.84 --> 1176.48
that yeah you can give somebody a pill

1174.41 --> 1178.25
doesn't have the actual chemical

1176.48 --> 1181.46
substance in it tell them what it's

1178.25 --> 1185.39
supposed to do and they will potentially

1181.46 --> 1188.8400000000001
receive it they will be transformed by

1185.39 --> 1192.89
it and that's psychosomatic so what's to

1188.84 --> 1196.9099999999999
say right that is knowledge medical

1192.89 --> 1199.4
proven knowledge very reliable very very

1196.91 --> 1203.75
reliable knowledge this it's it's

1199.4 --> 1206.0
basically a pillar of medic of medicine

1203.75 --> 1207.59
not necessarily Alif it's just a pillar

1206.0 --> 1209.74
of medicine it's the psychosomatic if

1207.59 --> 1212.6299999999999
you give so it they might actually

1209.74 --> 1216.67
that's even how they do who medical

1212.63 --> 1217.91
research with drugs okay is it so

1216.67 --> 1220.3100000000002
psychosomatic

1217.91 --> 1224.3300000000002
what's to say that if people can't heal

1220.31 --> 1227.54
themselves by taking a fake drug that

1224.33 --> 1229.1899999999998
they can't get a disease by imagining

1227.54 --> 1230.93
themselves getting that disease and

1229.19 --> 1232.73
learning everything about the symptoms

1230.93 --> 1236.5900000000001
and then basically creating those

1232.73 --> 1243.08
symptoms do you understand

1236.59 --> 1247.1299999999999
see my case is not that far off I really

1243.08 --> 1254.48
have something here this this is not a a

1247.13 --> 1257.39
conspiracy theory or well maybe maybe it

1254.48 --> 1259.01
is partially but it's not it's not a

1257.39 --> 1262.4
conspiracy theory in the classical so

1259.01 --> 1267.47
it's much more ethereal so much to do

1262.4 --> 1270.89
with psychology and how that works so I

1267.47 --> 1273.53
think that viruses in general fall more

1270.89 --> 1277.9
into the category of mind control and

1273.53 --> 1280.97
then they do of actual medical threats

1277.9 --> 1286.25
that's my conclusion and that's pretty

1280.97 --> 1290.0
Universal is AIDS all that nonsense how

1286.25 --> 1293.24
well did that turn out to be real so

1290.0 --> 1298.55
yeah as I said before in the medical

1293.24 --> 1300.03
world bacteria kind of real very local

1298.55 --> 1305.27
always its fact

1300.03 --> 1307.92
that yeah bacteria are things but

1305.27 --> 1309.6299999999999
there's also parasites those are

1307.92 --> 1312.72
definitely they're probably the bigger

1309.63 --> 1314.73
threat they are likes pretty unique

1312.72 --> 1316.8600000000001
organisms and they really are

1314.73 --> 1320.1
self-sufficient they are definitely

1316.86 --> 1324.08
there but then viruses is it really a

1320.1 --> 1327.7099999999998
separate robot unit Micro Micro

1324.08 --> 1332.79
microorganism or is it basically a

1327.71 --> 1337.5900000000001
oddity biome side-effect of the almost

1332.79 --> 1340.1599999999999
infinitely complex biology of life

1337.59 --> 1340.1599999999999
itself

1347.299 --> 1354.809
so yeah and I really hope that people

1352.89 --> 1356.8200000000002
some people out there will pick up on

1354.809 --> 1358.74
this maybe do their own research maybe

1356.82 --> 1362.76
shove some things in my fish you know

1358.74 --> 1367.289
because as I've been kind of honest

1362.76 --> 1369.12
about I am a lot of I get most of my

1367.289 --> 1373.95
information through talking with people

1369.12 --> 1377.6399999999999
and kind of even extracting extras the

1373.95 --> 1379.8600000000001
ethereal information also the trust

1377.64 --> 1383.419
level of when I listen to people is

1379.86 --> 1386.639
extremely important to me because that

1383.419 --> 1389.429
the level of trust really determines

1386.639 --> 1391.289
throughout time how valuable all the

1389.429 --> 1396.289
information that comes through them is

1391.289 --> 1401.25
and thus how close to the the final

1396.289 --> 1403.529
illumination for me so that is how I get

1401.25 --> 1405.87
most my information and books not so

1403.529 --> 1408.389
much other people do read books and then

1405.87 --> 1411.1999999999998
they get they've silence or partially

1408.389 --> 1413.9699999999998
become those books in their speaking

1411.2 --> 1417.48
that's typically with my librarian

1413.97 --> 1420.269
friends very obvious she's so memorized

1417.48 --> 1424.2
in the way she thinks and speaks it's

1420.269 --> 1426.929
all basically lent I don't I do quite

1424.2 --> 1430.95
the opposite I take it all from the

1426.929 --> 1433.3200000000002
ethereal from the esoteric from people

1430.95 --> 1437.07
but that doesn't mean that there isn't

1433.32 --> 1441.4189999999999
worthwhile information and just backup

1437.07 --> 1444.87
data that can potentially backup my

1441.419 --> 1449.0700000000002
point or against it who knows I'm I'm

1444.87 --> 1452.4289999999999
not saying this is absolutely absolutely

1449.07 --> 1455.4289999999999
definitive because biology world is very

1452.429 --> 1459.6000000000001
complex and there's just the mysteries

1455.429 --> 1461.8500000000001
never seem to end so who knows what else

1459.6 --> 1466.4699999999998
there is to be learned concerning the

1461.85 --> 1471.809
very concept of viruses and I I'm very

1466.47 --> 1474.1200000000001
willing to learn more and not just stick

1471.809 --> 1476.34
to some kind of anchor religious

1474.12 --> 1478.529
position or seemingly religious position

1476.34 --> 1479.52
right now it's just not real and I'm

1478.529 --> 1481.47
just gonna

1479.52 --> 1484.3799999999999
my everything no I want to see the data

1481.47 --> 1490.97
I really do and then I'm gonna figure it

1484.38 --> 1496.41
out no not that type of ethereal

1490.97 --> 1499.3500000000001
ethereal is with EI an ethereal

1496.41 --> 1502.8300000000002
basically means non-physical that's the

1499.35 --> 1506.76
classic meaning it's the so it could be

1502.83 --> 1509.57
energy and it is energy I see it as

1506.76 --> 1511.26
frequency people speaking and thinking

1509.57 --> 1516.0
following the way they have their

1511.26 --> 1519.39
frequency they have their compression so

1516.0 --> 1522.3
I kind of almost compare people to a

1519.39 --> 1527.0
wave function the wave but it is

1522.3 --> 1527.0
metaphorical I can feel it though

1531.27 --> 1537.57
and yeah but that doesn't make either a

1535.29 --> 1542.21
wave though it's just a comparison it is

1537.57 --> 1550.559
a theory or ethereal opposing to

1542.21 --> 1554.28
material because ethereal things are

1550.559 --> 1557.85
very tough to back up with material

1554.28 --> 1562.1399999999999
things therefore also scientifically

1557.85 --> 1565.59
because it is pretty much a correlative

1562.14 --> 1568.0500000000002
framework structure a and as a person

1565.59 --> 1571.1999999999998
for personal interactions and knowledge

1568.05 --> 1574.44
building yeah that's the only option you

1571.2 --> 1579.21
have because reality and information is

1574.44 --> 1583.14
way too complex to all put into one

1579.21 --> 1587.04
rudimentary physical based method like

1583.14 --> 1589.3200000000002
science although for actually physically

1587.04 --> 1591.21
figuring out that the physical details

1589.32 --> 1593.28
of the realm and everything and material

1591.21 --> 1598.07
that's extremely important as for a

1593.28 --> 1602.85
personal development yeah that's I think

1598.07 --> 1605.7
that we must we are sir we this the only

1602.85 --> 1608.34
option we have is to learn to understand

1605.7 --> 1611.07
things by building conceptual frameworks

1608.34 --> 1612.3
in our minds relaying everything and

1611.07 --> 1615.54
it's going to be all intuitive

1612.3 --> 1617.28
eventually you're not gonna constantly

1615.54 --> 1619.3799999999999
have information passed through your

1617.28 --> 1620.67
conscious it's kind of your intuitions

1619.38 --> 1623.3400000000001
gonna build that it's going to do that

1620.67 --> 1625.6200000000001
it's going to give it a conceptual

1623.34 --> 1628.6499999999999
colour to you to recognize it and just

1625.62 --> 1630.2399999999998
choose wisely and there's where as the

1628.65 --> 1631.89
wisdom comes from it's a side effect

1630.24 --> 1633.8700000000001
wisdom is a side effect of that

1631.89 --> 1636.0
intuition process that becomes better

1633.87 --> 1638.52
and that takes over for your conscious

1636.0 --> 1641.309
but yeah it's all gonna be conceptual

1638.52 --> 1644.309
frameworks so things like the ether

1641.309 --> 1646.7
falls down that Lane the light either so

1644.309 --> 1649.44
conceptual framework is no physical

1646.7 --> 1652.679
backup for it but it's the framework and

1649.44 --> 1655.8600000000001
it fits so well well in physics that's

1652.679 --> 1657.47
what's called an aberration that's

1655.86 --> 1661.6599999999999
physics

1657.47 --> 1665.15
you can do the ethereal on physics

1661.66 --> 1668.42
because it is you exact opposite it

1665.15 --> 1669.0800000000002
doesn't work it doesn't stick it's a

1668.42 --> 1672.47
mistake

1669.08 --> 1674.81
yeah it'll form on top of it but it'll

1672.47 --> 1676.88
never stick you could never get it to

1674.81 --> 1680.1499999999999
stick because it has no physical

1676.88 --> 1684.6200000000001
foundation it is a theory oh it is it's

1680.15 --> 1688.52
uncanny how these words all eventually

1684.62 --> 1692.33
sink down in the same spots with the

1688.52 --> 1694.52
same results it's almost like almost

1692.33 --> 1698.47
feels like geometry except with actual

1694.52 --> 1698.47
meanings of words and not with numbers

1703.93 --> 1713.1200000000001
ether is a type of fuel that's hilarious

1710.14 --> 1719.63
now you have the the chemical substance

1713.12 --> 1722.12
ether also the ethers be used a lot but

1719.63 --> 1726.5
yeah the roots of the word I'm pretty

1722.12 --> 1729.8
convinced are well probably originally

1726.5 --> 1731.99
lent from alchemy with the four elements

1729.8 --> 1734.8999999999999
the four physical elements and the fifth

1731.99 --> 1736.94
element either and that is specifically

1734.9 --> 1741.2800000000002
designated as this period the

1736.94 --> 1741.28
non-physical that's why it's also on top

1741.67 --> 1746.99
but yeah the ancients knew that

1744.35 --> 1748.85
distinction they knew it very well but

1746.99 --> 1750.47
it has become extremely diluted

1748.85 --> 1752.99
throughout language and there over

1750.47 --> 1755.84
complications in this narrow down

1752.99 --> 1758.3
meanings that people lend from things

1755.84 --> 1761.6
distorting their original foundational

1758.3 --> 1765.85
meaning and so the meaning of word

1761.6 --> 1765.85
become words become lost to us

1773.1 --> 1780.9989999999998
[Music]

1787.2 --> 1789.89
right

1791.56 --> 1797.47
well the religious intolerant how about

1794.17 --> 1801.22
the the non-physical nature of the

1797.47 --> 1803.95
heavenly bodies four years ago I started

1801.22 --> 1806.38
to say in internet chat so on Patricius

1803.95 --> 1808.78
on Nathan's even back then on Antonius

1806.38 --> 1811.96
uberx all over the place son isn't

1808.78 --> 1813.94
physical it's not literally there you

1811.96 --> 1817.21
just see that as a side effect

1813.94 --> 1818.71
it's holographic I don't know how it is

1817.21 --> 1820.99
there but it's always at the edge of

1818.71 --> 1823.1200000000001
vision it doesn't change angular size in

1820.99 --> 1828.49
its pathway doesn't change angular speed

1823.12 --> 1832.03
and it disappears behind an arbitrary

1828.49 --> 1834.25
position the horizon well I wasn't even

1832.03 --> 1835.66
that clear back then about the arbitrary

1834.25 --> 1837.97
position of the horizon it was still

1835.66 --> 1840.46
somewhat of a mystery but it that's very

1837.97 --> 1843.34
obvious now so that backups back swapped

1840.46 --> 1843.99
my point even further then I introduced

1843.34 --> 1845.6799999999998
that

1843.99 --> 1848.74
holographics and there were some other

1845.68 --> 1851.65
people also kind of offering it but I

1848.74 --> 1853.93
wasn't one of the first which is this is

1851.65 --> 1856.18
it I'm gonna blow everyone's mind with

1853.93 --> 1858.94
this [ __ ] it's gonna be so surreal and

1856.18 --> 1871.9
it's real and I love it because it's

1858.94 --> 1874.24
fresh its new it's challenging what I'm

1871.9 --> 1878.0800000000002
pretty sure the Sun travels in arcs that

1874.24 --> 1878.53
apparent Sun this doesn't travel in a

1878.08 --> 1882.79
straight line

1878.53 --> 1885.1299999999999
Ian Adams that's just wrong so that's

1882.79 --> 1890.1399999999999
one of the terminologies now another one

1885.13 --> 1893.5
was the concealment now of course most

1890.14 --> 1897.46
people still call it not it's not done

1893.5 --> 1898.98
yet you know I don't know there's a lot

1897.46 --> 1901.6000000000001
of people that really like to stick to

1898.98 --> 1903.46
they make one decision about it and then

1901.6 --> 1906.1599999999999
even later if it seems technically

1903.46 --> 1910.0900000000001
slightly incorrect they will still want

1906.16 --> 1912.43
to stick to the words that they know so

1910.09 --> 1914.56
yeah not saying that every terminology

1912.43 --> 1918.04
the Fed ever introduced has become part

1914.56 --> 1921.49
of the I am NOT B vocabulary of Flat

1918.04 --> 1923.059
Earth okay not claiming that but a lot

1921.49 --> 1931.009
of concepts have

1923.059 --> 1932.57
have become integrated and I was there

1931.009 --> 1934.159
to hand it out at first and that the

1932.57 --> 1938.1689999999999
first people laughed at me I thought I

1934.159 --> 1938.169
was crazy and it just didn't get it

1945.13 --> 1950.0200000000002
all right so yeah my typical

1948.059 --> 1952.27
conceptualizations are the globe of the

1950.02 --> 1958.6
heavens that my glowed of globe of the

1952.27 --> 1960.91
heavens the optical slant of course also

1958.6 --> 1964.84
known as the horizon optical slant is

1960.91 --> 1968.049
more apparent geometrics it's more

1964.84 --> 1973.289
emphasis it emphasizes the geometric

1968.049 --> 1977.44
nature of the visual itself more

1973.289 --> 1979.72
horizons very broad term it's been used

1977.44 --> 1989.38
in everything it's become a standard in

1979.72 --> 1991.75
a way horizontal so optical slants yeah

1989.38 --> 1994.3500000000001
I pretty much I'm sure I'm pretty much

1991.75 --> 1997.21
the first guy to say that the

1994.35 --> 2000.48
obstruction or the concealment rate

1997.21 --> 2004.88
beyond the horizon is linear over

2000.48 --> 2009.659
distance so that thing's getting cut off

2004.88 --> 2014.0700000000002
bottom up like the actual height of what

2009.659 --> 2018.63
is being effectively cut off that height

2014.07 --> 2020.82
is gonna increase in height at a linear

2018.63 --> 2022.65
rate over the distance after the

2020.82 --> 2025.4399999999998
apparent horizon point now there's also

2022.65 --> 2029.8500000000001
of course other atmospheric bending

2025.44 --> 2033.38
effects on top of that but on the

2029.85 --> 2036.3899999999999
clearest of clear days this should work

2033.38 --> 2041.5800000000002
it should be linear the amount of things

2036.39 --> 2046.7990000000002
getting cut off like the bottom of

2041.58 --> 2049.02
building the standards of oil rigs how

2046.799 --> 2051.619
much effectively of the real height of

2049.02 --> 2054.54
them is going to be cut off that amount

2051.619 --> 2056.8790000000004
which is concealed underneath that

2054.54 --> 2058.29
mirror effect which does all kinds of

2056.879 --> 2059.49
thing that is going to increase in

2058.29 --> 2061.2
height at a linear rate I mean

2059.49 --> 2063.6589999999997
absolutely certain I'm the first one to

2061.2 --> 2066.6899999999996
even make that claim it's extremely

2063.659 --> 2070.31
brutally difficult to prove because of

2066.69 --> 2072.899
atmospheric effects but yeah it is

2070.31 --> 2075.33
specifically noted in opposition to a

2072.899 --> 2080.25
cumulative drop which is blue

2075.33 --> 2082.68
then li obvious not there lately obvious

2080.25 --> 2085.83
that's never been proven never ever ever

2082.68 --> 2089.96
so there lays the claim

2085.83 --> 2094.13
I can't empirically prove it

2089.96 --> 2099.45
but I can definitely claim that over any

2094.13 --> 2100.25
cumulative drop rate as presumed which

2099.45 --> 2103.89
is not there

2100.25 --> 2106.56
absolutely not even the end of it Bala

2103.89 --> 2111.24
haven't even actually went to claim that

2106.56 --> 2113.1
really the technical ones just saying so

2111.24 --> 2117.6899999999996
I therefore stayed yeah the concealment

2113.1 --> 2120.72
lay rate over distance is linear points

2117.69 --> 2124.08
vary yeah and it is kind of you know it

2120.72 --> 2125.7599999999998
doesn't even directly say anything about

2124.08 --> 2128.22
how far you should be able to see

2125.76 --> 2130.8
because that's another effect that's the

2128.22 --> 2133.9399999999996
overall refraction due to the refraction

2130.8 --> 2137.9100000000003
index of the atmosphere and if it's high

2133.94 --> 2140.85
then there will be a great soup blurring

2137.91 --> 2143.46
things up if the refraction is high

2140.85 --> 2145.74
it'll be close by use these things but

2143.46 --> 2147.54
they will be surrounded by it will see

2145.74 --> 2150.87
more like a cutout with the gray soup if

2147.54 --> 2152.7599999999998
the refraction is low then certainly oh

2150.87 --> 2155.91
you will now be able to see that piece

2152.76 --> 2158.4
of island behind there behind this tower

2155.91 --> 2162.33
and a great soup over there and that is

2158.4 --> 2165.06
effectively the real effect that that

2162.33 --> 2167.1
affects the line of sight has nothing to

2165.06 --> 2169.0499999999997
do with the concealment rate that

2167.1 --> 2172.68
consume and rate the optical slants

2169.05 --> 2174.84
mirrors own or whatever effects whatever

2172.68 --> 2177.06
is concealed that effect is diffraction

2174.84 --> 2178.9500000000003
based isn't it's to do with lenses and

2177.06 --> 2180.2999999999997
what happens when light travels over

2178.95 --> 2183.24
straight surfaces in very close

2180.3 --> 2185.79
proximity and of course resolution all

2183.24 --> 2190.5
of it combined effectively causes the

2185.79 --> 2194.13
optical slant and the horizon and the

2190.5 --> 2197.58
consumer rate of that effect that is

2194.13 --> 2202.04
what I claimed specifically that then

2197.58 --> 2205.43
yep the consumer rate is linear over the

2202.04 --> 2205.43
just to be clear

2212.089 --> 2218.069
yeah great soup or blue soup usually

2215.339 --> 2221.369
when it's it's thick refraction then

2218.069 --> 2224.519
it's going to be gray soup when the day

2221.369 --> 2226.9990000000003
is clear then it's going to be just a

2224.519 --> 2226.999
blue backdrop

2239.04 --> 2246.7799999999997
Oh so yeah 35 minutes put quite a lot

2244.59 --> 2249.9900000000002
out there I kind of need to take a

2246.78 --> 2255.48
breather whoa

2249.99 --> 2258.18
oh dear somebody's blanket just dropped

2255.48 --> 2265.05
or was basically just blown off their

2258.18 --> 2270.54
balcony into the grass below that sucks

2265.05 --> 2272.8100000000004
I have to go down and get it it's not a

2270.54 --> 2276.45
good it's not a good day to put your

2272.81 --> 2279.23
your drying wash outside it's a way to

2276.45 --> 2279.23
win you for that

2283.15 --> 2291.4100000000003
yeah loose lips awareness thank you yeah

2286.61 --> 2293.9900000000002
I do think I'm smart to recognize it

2291.41 --> 2296.48
where did I get it all from well from a

2293.99 --> 2298.9399999999996
lifetime of paying attention not

2296.48 --> 2300.86
necessarily understanding but still

2298.94 --> 2307.34
remembering enough and eventually

2300.86 --> 2310.01
finding a way to use my talents to grab

2307.34 --> 2311.8700000000003
a deeper meaning to it oh and a

2310.01 --> 2316.28
connection in my own way and it's very

2311.87 --> 2318.0499999999997
ethereal so in a technical sense and

2316.28 --> 2324.67
it's gonna rub some people the wrong way

2318.05 --> 2324.67
I could call it divined i divined it

2328.88 --> 2337.31
yeah I can do that

2332.63 --> 2339.77
but it is absolutely thanks to the good

2337.31 --> 2344.75
people that have gotten to know that

2339.77 --> 2348.98
I've gotten to trust and my sensibility

2344.75 --> 2351.02
into understanding the value specific

2348.98 --> 2353.57
value of their knowledge and then

2351.02 --> 2363.05
putting it all together in my own

2353.57 --> 2366.44
picture and a lot of it is by feel but

2363.05 --> 2370.2200000000003
yeah as I grow older more of the feel

2366.44 --> 2373.16
gets replaced by empirical data to prove

2370.22 --> 2378.68
it to back it up that's the funny thing

2373.16 --> 2380.93
about it define intelligent going to

2378.68 --> 2384.49
claim divining now I'm talking about the

2380.93 --> 2384.49
process of divining

2393.0 --> 2398.5
right

2395.41 --> 2398.5
[Music]

2404.85 --> 2411.2799999999997
[Music]

2407.28 --> 2413.4700000000003
it's kind of funny because there's all

2411.28 --> 2416.86
kinds of things to the word defining and

2413.47 --> 2419.95
what its gonna Liza as and and of course

2416.86 --> 2423.2200000000003
the divine the deities but that's kind

2419.95 --> 2425.23
of a separate matter it's not really the

2423.22 --> 2428.2
same thing it's not about godness it's

2425.23 --> 2431.32
about a certain action that you can do

2428.2 --> 2433.5099999999998
its ethereal and this is fugly enough in

2431.32 --> 2439.21
in games like for example tennis and

2433.51 --> 2442.5400000000004
Dragons defining is is a magic

2439.21 --> 2448.17
discipline it is basically information

2442.54 --> 2451.12
and detection magic I have to say that

2448.17 --> 2453.07
that's kind of exactly what it feels

2451.12 --> 2455.17
like even though I'm not writing down

2453.07 --> 2457.3
spells and memorizing them and then

2455.17 --> 2458.71
dunno go booga-booga and employing and

2457.3 --> 2463.2400000000002
something happened no that's not

2458.71 --> 2467.53
happening but to the essence yeah it

2463.24 --> 2470.2299999999996
kind of does no dungeon tracks is not

2467.53 --> 2473.67
data it's just a correlative giant game

2470.23 --> 2476.29
framework that has lent a huge

2473.67 --> 2480.9900000000002
preponderance of information from the

2476.29 --> 2480.99
world all kinds of things

2487.39 --> 2500.359
so yeah you don't have to get all

2492.709 --> 2501.979
exoteric on me again hm I make the best

2500.359 --> 2509.839
spells right sure

2501.979 --> 2512.6589999999997
yeah anyway it's not really spells you

2509.839 --> 2515.63
know its own the other word on the other

2512.659 --> 2517.5190000000002
hand no information and how its

2515.63 --> 2522.1400000000003
presented and the effects it will have

2517.519 --> 2526.609
on people could be considered spells you

2522.14 --> 2531.2889999999998
know spelling so in a technical sense

2526.609 --> 2534.619
words are spells but it is the deeper

2531.289 --> 2537.829
meaning and the reflection and all that

2534.619 --> 2541.069
that gives the words their power and it

2537.829 --> 2544.3390000000004
is the individual wielding them that

2541.069 --> 2546.919
does the actual magic not the word

2544.339 --> 2547.729
although separate words these days you

2546.919 --> 2550.269
know they can be their own self

2547.729 --> 2556.249
containing thing and that's called memes

2550.269 --> 2558.529
they're like sub and DS and they're

2556.249 --> 2561.459
infectious they're the virus of the mind

2558.529 --> 2561.459
memes

2568.42 --> 2574.39
Hey Ares 106 look a dungeon dragon says

2571.93 --> 2577.21
everything and if you want to open up a

2574.39 --> 2579.25
can of demons and start enacting demon

2577.21 --> 2582.579
encounters and getting all the demonic

2579.25 --> 2585.519
lore in there and then speak out the

2582.579 --> 2588.5190000000002
freaking spells you imagined your gamers

2585.519 --> 2591.16
to do yeah yeah you could definitely get

2588.519 --> 2593.859
yourself in some spiritual trouble it's

2591.16 --> 2598.269
not what I do though I just see demons

2593.859 --> 2601.0589999999997
as pawns and I do regard them as like

2598.269 --> 2604.39
dark and dangerous and even though they

2601.059 --> 2607.9900000000002
are conceptual in my game I kind of warn

2604.39 --> 2610.8689999999997
my players about it like I know it's

2607.99 --> 2612.91
just a game but it's a game that you're

2610.869 --> 2615.4300000000003
gonna take very serious because what

2612.91 --> 2620.019
your characters are gonna do there is

2615.43 --> 2622.93
not it's not just a pawn and like

2620.019 --> 2625.8689999999997
spiritual meaning is still important in

2622.93 --> 2627.7889999999998
the game so it is kind of sub real but

2625.869 --> 2630.369
it is real to me and that's how I to

2627.789 --> 2633.579
play that game but yeah hey if you're

2630.369 --> 2636.73
gonna do real demon reenactment [ __ ] and

2633.579 --> 2638.559
yeah sure people can do that but he said

2636.73 --> 2643.119
really Dungeons and Dragons I don't see

2638.559 --> 2648.0890000000004
any written down demonic spells in there

2643.119 --> 2651.7000000000003
that are literally like but that no no

2648.089 --> 2653.5589999999997
that's not in there maybe like you're

2651.7 --> 2656.3799999999997
one of the first editions or something I

2653.559 --> 2658.779
don't know I don't haven't seen any of

2656.38 --> 2662.8900000000003
that what are in there are like

2658.779 --> 2666.97
descriptions of pretty dark [ __ ] but

2662.89 --> 2668.92
that's just mechanics it's there's no in

2666.97 --> 2670.72
conditions that people can get upset

2668.92 --> 2673.779
over no but on the other hand hey

2670.72 --> 2676.089
there's been people out there people

2673.779 --> 2678.16
that really don't like Christians for

2676.089 --> 2679.71
example that have played dungeon dragons

2678.16 --> 2683.44
that have been game masters that have

2679.71 --> 2687.4900000000002
put demonic lore in games because they

2683.44 --> 2689.9500000000003
wanna de and I've even known personally

2687.49 --> 2691.8689999999997
some of these people that do that [ __ ]

2689.95 --> 2694.4199999999996
and I really dislike it when they do

2691.869 --> 2695.829
that I'm like don't track that

2694.42 --> 2698.109
disgusting [ __ ]

2695.829 --> 2699.29
in the game that I'm a part of thank you

2698.109 --> 2701.23
very much

2699.29 --> 2705.1
because otherwise I'm going to step away

2701.23 --> 2709.1
so yeah but that's the individuals

2705.1 --> 2712.2999999999997
inserting their demonic [ __ ] in the game

2709.1 --> 2715.94
it's not the game itself doesn't have

2712.3 --> 2717.6200000000003
Dark Ritual and contusions yet it has

2715.94 --> 2720.85
some story and there it is

2717.62 --> 2726.0499999999997
gruesome descriptions here and there and

2720.85 --> 2728.66
evil magic and whatever but it's still

2726.05 --> 2732.11
just mechanics bound there's no literal

2728.66 --> 2736.46
in condition satanic rituals that are

2732.11 --> 2741.01
derived from real things in there to be

2736.46 --> 2743.78
found that's that is paranoid fantasy

2741.01 --> 2745.7000000000003
from people that haven't actually looked

2743.78 --> 2749.3300000000004
through it or that got completely caught

2745.7 --> 2754.72
up upon that there are just yeah like

2749.33 --> 2754.72
dark gruesome spells described in there

2755.23 --> 2760.61
you know it is if I it is a combat game

2758.21 --> 2763.52
technically everything about dungeon

2760.61 --> 2767.06
dragon is common it is all you use magic

2763.52 --> 2770.45
you use bows use swords you use your

2767.06 --> 2772.61
freaking fists to splatter things that's

2770.45 --> 2775.5499999999997
basically what the system is it's a it's

2772.61 --> 2776.71
a it's a combat simulator based system

2775.55 --> 2781.67
that's what it is

2776.71 --> 2786.62
it doesn't make it I don't know any more

2781.67 --> 2788.66
evil than just any video game you know

2786.62 --> 2793.24
and there's some video games out there

2788.66 --> 2793.24
that do kind of drag in some dark [ __ ]

2793.36 --> 2805.2400000000002
so I don't know it's dungeon dragons

2797.39 --> 2805.24
really so demonic I don't think so yeah

2806.49 --> 2809.54
[Music]

2811.969 --> 2820.049
now I don't need any spells now I have

2817.199 --> 2824.069
my connection with the Creator I have my

2820.049 --> 2830.309
knowledge my biggest spell power is my

2824.069 --> 2836.249
immunity to spells part it's a big

2830.309 --> 2838.529
advantage of great insight I thought it

2836.249 --> 2842.399
was a dice based board game yeah it is

2838.529 --> 2845.249
but it is a combat simulator added it's

2842.399 --> 2848.519
a turn-based combat simulator you

2845.249 --> 2850.529
splatter the enemies or you trick them

2848.519 --> 2851.999
or you can do all your diplom eyes

2850.529 --> 2854.789
you're way out of them I kind of made

2851.999 --> 2858.2389999999996
the game more diplomatic I gave a lot of

2854.789 --> 2861.3590000000004
extra functions and skills and even

2858.239 --> 2863.879
character types that you can play that

2861.359 --> 2865.799
emphasize the function of diplomacy if

2863.879 --> 2867.509
you don't want to splatter the enemy but

2865.799 --> 2871.259
you want to make them your followers

2867.509 --> 2872.999
through good reasons through a vision

2871.259 --> 2877.319
for example that a character may have

2872.999 --> 2879.3889999999997
yeah that you know the potential is much

2877.319 --> 2883.349
more than just a combat simulator it is

2879.389 --> 2885.9790000000003
a potential realm simulator that's what

2883.349 --> 2889.1090000000004
it's become to me I simulate an entire

2885.979 --> 2891.569
world an entire realm with several

2889.109 --> 2894.5989999999997
continents and peoples in giant history

2891.569 --> 2896.579
of thousands of years and arrival from

2894.599 --> 2898.679
other planes of the other dimensions

2896.579 --> 2900.8390000000004
where all the peoples came from and the

2898.679 --> 2902.369
gods that are on the backdrop throughout

2900.839 --> 2904.879
time doing their things in their own

2902.369 --> 2909.089
contracts and having plans and having

2904.879 --> 2912.0589999999997
tricks and then inevitable things that

2909.089 --> 2914.3089999999997
are a consequence of all this that will

2912.059 --> 2915.6890000000003
play out in a kind of Lord of the Rings

2914.309 --> 2917.3990000000003
feel because Lord of the Rings people

2915.689 --> 2919.109
forget about it everything that happens

2917.399 --> 2921.5389999999998
in Lord of the Rings is absolutely

2919.109 --> 2922.979
inevitable because it is all things that

2921.539 --> 2924.929
happened that were just set in motion

2922.979 --> 2927.1789999999996
and they were all going to happen not

2924.929 --> 2929.879
maybe literally exactly as they did in

2927.179 --> 2932.609
the story but it was going to go that

2929.879 --> 2933.089
direction Sauron was gonna conquer the

2932.609 --> 2935.49
world

2933.089 --> 2940.2599999999998
it was absolutely inevitable

2935.49 --> 2942.66
and I draw from this giant realm that I

2940.26 --> 2945.0600000000004
created and all the different things

2942.66 --> 2948.69
that I put out there and how they will

2945.06 --> 2953.94
respond as their simulated person to the

2948.69 --> 2956.16
entire world and then feel it feel where

2953.94 --> 2958.59
it's going and then feel how the players

2956.16 --> 2961.14
change it with their will because they

2958.59 --> 2962.94
may not have this outside they're much

2961.14 --> 2967.5899999999997
more bound to the oversight of their

2962.94 --> 2969.9
characters so yeah it's a giant realm

2967.59 --> 2972.23
simulator and it's all in my head and on

2969.9 --> 2972.23
paper

2983.21 --> 2987.4700000000003
somebody banned all these socks please

3016.06 --> 3030.5
thank you yeah they love to just make it

3027.29 --> 3033.08
more goofy you know they because that

3030.5 --> 3035.51
way when people watch everything that I

3033.08 --> 3037.58
just said after the whole conversation

3035.51 --> 3039.8300000000004
talking about the potential biological

3037.58 --> 3041.5699999999997
nature of viruses and is it real and

3039.83 --> 3045.7999999999997
spells and now drawing it in together

3041.57 --> 3048.26
they just want people to chillax and

3045.8 --> 3049.5800000000004
think about games again no just have a

3048.26 --> 3054.23
fun dumb thing

3049.58 --> 3057.71
so they insert socks that for worked

3054.23 --> 3062.09
dumb things instead of even for me you

3057.71 --> 3065.26
know to distract me to just to make the

3062.09 --> 3068.09
hole very serious train of thought stop

3065.26 --> 3071.1200000000003
because it burns them it burns us

3068.09 --> 3074.1800000000003
doesn't it Gollum it burns us yeah

3071.12 --> 3076.22
bright light very condensed very

3074.18 --> 3079.7
condensed wider arcing meaning that

3076.22 --> 3081.3799999999997
involves the entire world yeah you don't

3079.7 --> 3085.6299999999997
like that you want it to be goofy and

3081.38 --> 3085.63
dumb that's not gonna happen

3099.7 --> 3107.6499999999996
know how the time is flown man talked

3104.72 --> 3107.6499999999996
about a lot of things

3132.21 --> 3137.339
oh yeah by the way talking about that

3134.609 --> 3138.5989999999997
that's funny I read a really interesting

3137.339 --> 3143.13
article hm

3138.599 --> 3146.6090000000004
I have to find it back where it was

3143.13 --> 3151.52
fairly specifically talked about how the

3146.609 --> 3155.64
Dutch are so great at English because

3151.52 --> 3157.079
they yeah or well there was mentioned it

3155.64 --> 3161.67
was not what the article is about it was

3157.079 --> 3167.849
about the detrimental effects of what is

3161.67 --> 3174.96
it of dubbing foreign series oh yeah now

3167.849 --> 3176.849
I remember it was it had to do with it's

3174.96 --> 3180.7200000000003
one of the RTR articles and I kind of

3176.849 --> 3186.3
liked it let me try to find it back did

3180.72 --> 3190.95
they switch already dammit I have to

3186.3 --> 3193.4300000000003
find it back it was a pretty good

3190.95 --> 3193.43
article

3196.82 --> 3203.29
anyway what it was about it was about

3199.1 --> 3207.89
Hollywood a little and also about how

3203.29 --> 3211.16
dubbing things is detrimental to the

3207.89 --> 3213.62
quality of the product and also has a

3211.16 --> 3216.02
long-term negative influence on the

3213.62 --> 3219.8599999999997
public that effectively get dumbed down

3216.02 --> 3224.57
because of it and also because cultural

3219.86 --> 3228.02
details are lost in the dubbing you know

3224.57 --> 3230.81
if you get a subtitle as I used to grow

3228.02 --> 3232.94
up with a lot so many English things or

3230.81 --> 3236.18
Spanish things or even French things

3232.94 --> 3237.86
German things Dutch subtitles or

3236.18 --> 3240.23
sometimes even English subtitles are

3237.86 --> 3243.5
some of those now a BBC used to do that

3240.23 --> 3245.27
to English subtitles I even watch to be

3243.5 --> 3249.32
receiving so yeah I learned English a

3245.27 --> 3254.5099999999998
lot BBC was pretty good back then a lot

3249.32 --> 3258.6200000000003
of nature series anyway because they

3254.51 --> 3263.26
don't do it anymore a lot is lost of the

3258.62 --> 3267.56
original cultural context which is

3263.26 --> 3270.98
verbal effects that are kind of the

3267.56 --> 3272.72
paint of the way that culture speaks and

3270.98 --> 3275.27
it's going to be part of the design of

3272.72 --> 3277.0099999999998
the the series or the movie or whatever

3275.27 --> 3278.42
and if you're gonna have somebody else

3277.01 --> 3282.01
speak over that in another language

3278.42 --> 3284.75
that's all gonna be lost so cultural

3282.01 --> 3288.92
essence data that people are gonna miss

3284.75 --> 3291.95
out on and they become dumb they become

3288.92 --> 3293.11
numb down they don't get it they don't

3291.95 --> 3297.71
get it anymore

3293.11 --> 3299.21
so there was a study on that apparently

3297.71 --> 3301.82
and I thought it was very interesting

3299.21 --> 3308.09
and I back it up so that was worth

3301.82 --> 3315.56
mentioning the BBC I'm talking about

3308.09 --> 3317.9500000000003
freakin 30 20 years ago not now back in

3315.56 --> 3317.95
the day

3322.21 --> 3328.94
the BBC used to be pretty good it was

3326.54 --> 3331.49
like considered as like a higher

3328.94 --> 3337.07
standard even back in the day it's not

3331.49 --> 3340.06
so anymore I think you're banned that's

3337.07 --> 3340.06
what I think about it

3368.989 --> 3379.709
no no you shouldn't what what is up with

3374.88 --> 3382.949
these people I'm not saying you should

3379.709 --> 3385.859
trust the BBC I just said that 30 years

3382.949 --> 3387.2690000000002
ago they were great they were a high

3385.859 --> 3392.399
standard in media

3387.269 --> 3394.229
equality in spoken quality in just sheer

3392.399 --> 3397.89
depth of intellect that they would

3394.229 --> 3400.169
expose people to with their materials

3397.89 --> 3402.1189999999997
that was there it was good it was good

3400.169 --> 3403.89
it's not that anymore it's very

3402.119 --> 3406.7090000000003
blatantly obvious so I'm definitely not

3403.89 --> 3413.999
telling people to trust the BBC at this

3406.709 --> 3416.5389999999998
current age okay it's not what did we

3413.999 --> 3416.5389999999998
used to be

3422.72 --> 3430.31
yeah thanks for the moderation support

3425.42 --> 3433.4500000000003
by the way guys I'm not gonna let it

3430.31 --> 3433.45
ruin the conversation

3440.03 --> 3444.9
[Music]

3453.17 --> 3459.26
right

3454.92 --> 3462.98
yes News denier the people at the helm

3459.26 --> 3468.079
have a lot of priorities other than

3462.98 --> 3472.2
putting down things truly honestly as is

3468.079 --> 3476.369
there's no more slight political nudge

3472.2 --> 3479.269
no there is a heavy political drag now

3476.369 --> 3482.869
I'm not specifically talking about

3479.269 --> 3485.75
politics a political party no just

3482.869 --> 3490.1400000000003
politicization a heavy political drag

3485.75 --> 3492.39
heavy manipulation very forceful

3490.14 --> 3496.019
psychological manipulation going down

3492.39 --> 3499.89
over at the BBC from their products so

3496.019 --> 3501.75
now definitely don't I don't watch the

3499.89 --> 3503.91
BBC anymore haven't for a long time now

3501.75 --> 3504.829
and every time I do it just creeps me

3503.91 --> 3508.5589999999997
out

3504.829 --> 3511.319
it really creeps me out because the

3508.559 --> 3514.619
indoctrination layer the essence the

3511.319 --> 3518.7599999999998
little that just freaky feeling and that

3514.619 --> 3522.509
stoic Ness about desensitization is just

3518.76 --> 3527.69
so tangibly there in every basic thing

3522.509 --> 3532.5190000000002
and commercials and just talk shows and

3527.69 --> 3532.5190000000002
booth creeps me up

3534.86 --> 3541.2400000000002
no it's heavily manipulative you did it

3537.98 --> 3547.2400000000002
wasn't you didn't used to be like that

3541.24 --> 3553.97
it used to be kind of atheist liberal

3547.24 --> 3557.27
moderates and still priding what do you

3553.97 --> 3563.0299999999997
say being correct they pride it being

3557.27 --> 3565.61
correct a lot so they would even talk

3563.03 --> 3568.3100000000004
about religion and then just focus a lot

3565.61 --> 3570.65
on the historical things and they were

3568.31 --> 3573.08
just not that politicized back then it

3570.65 --> 3575.86
was all pretty good they're not like

3573.08 --> 3575.86
this anymore though

3579.93 --> 3582.68
all right

3587.35 --> 3592.99
now thank you good serving I appreciate

3590.29 --> 3595.93
that I just I don't know if people

3592.99 --> 3597.7
spiraling out of control over every

3595.93 --> 3601.6299999999997
little thing it's just I feel like I

3597.7 --> 3604.0
need to do that I just to me most of

3601.63 --> 3606.9700000000003
these things that I say after like the

3604.0 --> 3608.56
first sentence are just so blatantly

3606.97 --> 3610.2099999999996
obvious that at first I wouldn't even

3608.56 --> 3612.37
think about explaining it but then it

3610.21 --> 3613.93
just turns out like way gee I do have to

3612.37 --> 3615.88
explain it all because other people

3613.93 --> 3619.27
apparently just don't see it that

3615.88 --> 3622.27
obviously or they need to hear it they

3619.27 --> 3623.89
need to hear me say it in order to get

3622.27 --> 3627.28
it straight for them that that is what I

3623.89 --> 3635.02
think specifically I don't know I don't

3627.28 --> 3636.6400000000003
know but yeah everything I've been

3635.02 --> 3640.18
sharing this hang on was pretty good

3636.64 --> 3642.39
I think still stand behind everything I

3640.18 --> 3642.39
said

3647.96 --> 3651.11
[Music]

3654.47 --> 3660.14
yes that one guy yeah if you're gonna

3657.53 --> 3661.6400000000003
watch the news that's absolutely what

3660.14 --> 3664.069
you're gonna have to do if there's even

3661.64 --> 3666.95
anything real left because if you're for

3664.069 --> 3668.66
example are gonna watch like CNN you're

3666.95 --> 3671.1499999999996
gonna have to sit through a lot of

3668.66 --> 3673.79
garbage before you get anything that

3671.15 --> 3678.319
could actually because said it is some

3673.79 --> 3680.96
kind of data but yeah it's it's

3678.319 --> 3683.7799999999997
different with different news channels

3680.96 --> 3686.349
and but yeah you gotta sift through the

3683.78 --> 3689.6800000000003
propaganda in order to get to the goods

3686.349 --> 3689.6800000000003
these days

3709.7 --> 3716.21
well media in a way does spell-casting

3713.39 --> 3719.5989999999997
they have the capability and that spell

3716.21 --> 3722.93
can be good that spell can be bad it has

3719.599 --> 3726.7000000000003
a potential great impact on morale but

3722.93 --> 3729.319
if it if the news demoralize is too much

3726.7 --> 3737.75
then people will just step away and

3729.319 --> 3740.98
become an effective and because they've

3737.75 --> 3746.349
been overdoing things they're just

3740.98 --> 3749.45
they're just less effective really

3746.349 --> 3751.52
unless you want to call literally

3749.45 --> 3754.3089999999997
confusing the [ __ ] out of the entire

3751.52 --> 3757.069
world is the effect that they sought

3754.309 --> 3760.15
after in this point well then they

3757.069 --> 3760.15
aren't kind of effective

3775.58 --> 3780.5299999999997
right into the light yeah I do

3777.44 --> 3787.69
appreciate BBC's nature documentaries

3780.53 --> 3787.69
you know it's just that in most of them

3788.26 --> 3795.0200000000004
I'd almost wish there was an option to

3791.12 --> 3797.45
just turn off the narrative because it's

3795.02 --> 3799.1
like when they said oh it's over to die

3797.45 --> 3801.35
the climate church you have to do is

3799.1 --> 3803.69
they still show interesting footage of

3801.35 --> 3806.5099999999998
it there was just didn't hear that

3803.69 --> 3809.6
shitty you was just able to look at not

3806.51 --> 3811.5800000000004
the beautiful nature then I think that

3809.6 --> 3814.22
the how serious nature series would be a

3811.58 --> 3816.14
lot better because they do kind of ruin

3814.22 --> 3818.48
it with their climate change garbage non

3816.14 --> 3820.93
garbage nonsense that they just put in

3818.48 --> 3823.73
there so much worse than any kind of

3820.93 --> 3827.62
complaints about man destroying nature

3823.73 --> 3830.9
in the past which is it's still relevant

3827.62 --> 3833.27
but yeah it's just they overdo it with

3830.9 --> 3835.52
climate change garbage now that's very

3833.27 --> 3839.87
annoying so I wish there was an option

3835.52 --> 3843.5
to just turn off the voice during those

3839.87 --> 3845.99
moments and so you could just enjoy the

3843.5 --> 3848.06
entire nature documentary as is without

3845.99 --> 3850.5099999999998
any kind of nonsense point to make you

3848.06 --> 3850.5099999999998
feel terrible

3851.68 --> 3856.43
alright anyway I'm gonna run out the

3854.24 --> 3858.2599999999998
show so thanks everyone for coming I

3856.43 --> 3859.7
hope you like to show if you did please

3858.26 --> 3863.78
don't forget to upload it

3859.7 --> 3867.83
slap that Rogen's yesterday had two up

3863.78 --> 3868.75
votes still pretty long was kind of

3867.83 --> 3872.5699999999997
surreal

3868.75 --> 3875.72
so YouTube definitely did not like me

3872.57 --> 3878.81
doing that I guess cuz that's just

3875.72 --> 3880.43
absurd and a lot of live viewers to only

3878.81 --> 3886.07
have to up folks it's just absurd

3880.43 --> 3892.1
anyway I will be back tomorrow with flat

3886.07 --> 3894.56
earth early bird number 447 and mmm-hmm

3892.1 --> 3898.43
I'll probably see me around in the

3894.56 --> 3900.5299999999997
evening somewhere the flutter debates

3898.43 --> 3906.1
already started up I guess I'll hang

3900.53 --> 3912.52
around in chat I'll see and yeah

3906.1 --> 3912.52
until the next video keep it flat

3913.71 --> 3944.14
[Music]

3949.94 --> 3952.0
