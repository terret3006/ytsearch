137.34 --> 139.55
minutes

140.33 --> 150.02
but yeah I had a lot of fun had some

144.66 --> 154.71
beer and yeah despite it not being

150.02 --> 156.39000000000001
really organic which is bad for me yeah

154.71 --> 160.74
I don't feel too much football fat

156.39 --> 162.14999999999998
plenty of supplements too to make sure I

160.74 --> 167.22
don't have too much negative side

162.15 --> 171.54000000000002
effects and that a really good night's

167.22 --> 174.32
sleep it's also very nice that yeah

171.54 --> 176.85
after pretty much 2 o'clock

174.32 --> 179.54999999999998
almost all the fireworks completely died

176.85 --> 184.71
down so it's good to have a really nice

179.55 --> 187.58
calm night again and all the birds are

184.71 --> 192.53
also enjoying it again

187.58 --> 192.53
check it out magpie

195.09 --> 198.59
yeah sitting right there

200.49 --> 209.85000000000002
yeah all the birds are very happy

203.93 --> 217.16
bouncing it over I can hear the a hen

209.85 --> 220.2
crowing as well that's a prevent the

217.16 --> 223.29
chickens down here there's like around

220.2 --> 226.23
the corner down there there's like a

223.29 --> 228.29999999999998
little chicken house with a head and I

226.23 --> 230.57999999999998
kind of appreciate that hand growing I

228.3 --> 232.95000000000002
don't know what it is it's just some

230.58 --> 235.65
nice sensation nice and natural

232.95 --> 237.06
but yeah so these guys some of the

235.65 --> 240.06
neighbors here they were just throwing

237.06 --> 243.69
these heavy explosive fireworks right

240.06 --> 246.21
outside here and so I had like two like

243.69 --> 249.72
guys just don't do it there you're

246.21 --> 253.23000000000002
throwing these heavy explosives within

249.72 --> 255.21
like five meters of that chicken roost

253.23 --> 257.78999999999996
over there they're all gonna die from a

255.21 --> 260.82
heart attack if you don't stop it so

257.79 --> 262.74
yeah they did thankfully and they can

260.82 --> 267.09
still hear crowing so I guess they

262.74 --> 269.3
survived or at least the ended so that's

267.09 --> 269.29999999999995
good

271.12 --> 273.87
so

276.08 --> 283.28
yeah happy New Year to everyone even the

280.819 --> 286.21000000000004
ballers let's see how last long that

283.28 --> 286.21
happiness lasts

291.559 --> 296.92900000000003
oh yeah that was kind of weird though

293.679 --> 300.43899999999996
would my New Year celebration like yeah

296.929 --> 302.74899999999997
oh the digital clock says it's 2012

300.439 --> 308.389
right now that was kind of funny that I

302.749 --> 310.449
misspoke there 2012 I don't know it's

308.389 --> 310.449
just

313.5 --> 321.26
ah she just got lost in the moment I was

318.72 --> 321.26000000000005
kinda silly

322.24 --> 325.83
didn't really think about it anyway I

324.07 --> 331.83
was just having fun

325.83 --> 334.479
beer smoking and the smell of fireworks

331.83 --> 336.57
that was incredible fireworks in the

334.479 --> 340.57
distance that I showed you

336.57 --> 346.03
if only I'd have a better camera and it

340.57 --> 348.4
could show you a lot more detail but

346.03 --> 353.07
yeah until then I'm gonna have to do

348.4 --> 355.38899999999995
with this webcam but I hope you guys

353.07 --> 360.28
everyone in America has also had a

355.389 --> 366.43
pleasant new year by now they should

360.28 --> 370.0
have all of them maybe isn't like Hawaii

366.43 --> 374.47
the last place on in the world where

370.0 --> 377.169
it's celebrated I think even they should

374.47 --> 381.03900000000004
like just about to be celebrating it or

377.169 --> 383.139
have just celebrated or maybe they do it

381.039 --> 385.5
earlier synchronized to the United

383.139 --> 388.18
States region I don't know how it works

385.5 --> 392.699
but yeah pretty much everywhere in the

388.18 --> 392.699
world we have all entered 2019

403.93 --> 406.77
wait

408.74 --> 416.8
mm-hm I was expecting Nathan to

412.48 --> 418.69
I do a new show but I haven't seen any

416.8 --> 425.59000000000003
announced these only seem to be

418.69 --> 427.45
premiering it's some more of this all

425.59 --> 428.84999999999997
their stuff so I don't know if there's

427.45 --> 432.94
gonna be a debate

428.85 --> 435.1
anyway I am open for panel members

432.94 --> 437.74
anyone would like to join have a

435.1 --> 441.84000000000003
discussion I'll be fine

437.74 --> 441.84000000000003
as long as it's nice and calm

442.599 --> 445.979
get too overexcited

476.28 --> 480.78999999999996
made a lot of predictions yesterday I

479.19 --> 485.64
think

480.79 --> 485.64000000000004
let's yeah still stand behind him

486.59 --> 490.41999999999996
and

488.1 --> 495.34000000000003
it's weird

490.42 --> 498.73
like in terms of media's sources

495.34 --> 503.59
story is popping back up through

498.73 --> 507.65000000000003
scientists about the hollow moon concept

503.59 --> 510.04999999999995
in that chatter now so bring forth the

507.65 --> 513.8299999999999
Hollow Earth theory again the glow

510.05 --> 517.6
Hollow Earth theory of course so yeah it

513.83 --> 520.58
seems like that is indeed happening

517.6 --> 523.97
pretty quickly it has been happening

520.58 --> 527.08
last year but yeah it's getting right

523.97 --> 527.08
back on track with that

538.8 --> 544.2489999999999
Oh Nico NIC so sad

544.49 --> 552.36
keep up the fight

547.63 --> 552.36
maybe one day you can win the arguments

568.57 --> 574.5500000000001
Nik

571.04 --> 577.25
only reason you get banned is because

574.55 --> 580.52
you're acting like an ass that's really

577.25 --> 582.8
the only reason questioning individuals

580.52 --> 587.09
usually doesn't have a lot to do with it

582.8 --> 588.8299999999999
it's mostly the way you do it because

587.09 --> 592.07
yeah I also have my own issues with

588.83 --> 594.71
quantum eraser but yeah I don't get

592.07 --> 598.7
banned for it because I don't act like

594.71 --> 603.6500000000001
an [ __ ] like you do all the time so

598.7 --> 605.86
that's why you get that so just chill

603.65 --> 605.86
out

606.31 --> 610.2299999999999
and you'll not get banned here

628.72 --> 631.5600000000001
anyway

632.23 --> 638.38
I'd really appreciate it if I'd get some

634.63 --> 640.42
if I got them something guests anyone is

638.38 --> 643.74
out there

640.42 --> 649.209
you can imagine a lot of people are just

643.74 --> 653.49
sleeping out and yeah not having a lot

649.209 --> 653.4899999999999
of energy to to do debating

655.81 --> 661.7399999999999
so yeah I'm not expecting and you want

657.97 --> 661.74
to join but it would be very nice

674.28 --> 680.3
but yeah I'm not very talkative today

677.51 --> 687.6899999999999
not surprising

680.3 --> 692.5799999999999
lots to smoke and beer and the fireworks

687.69 --> 694.95
smells and yeah the explosion that was

692.58 --> 696.9000000000001
pretty close to me sent a shockwave

694.95 --> 701.0
through me that sucks all of these

696.9 --> 701.0
things together yeah they are ballast

702.83 --> 711.5200000000001
but yeah tomorrow it'll be like

707.57 --> 711.5200000000001
I'm not too worried but today

712.18 --> 720.3299999999999
I don't have a hangover but I just need

715.42 --> 720.3299999999999
to take it take it calm down

721.42 --> 724.86
very first always

727.83 --> 732.83
tea in here

729.83 --> 732.83
Cheers

770.22 --> 772.88
yeah

773.19 --> 781.1300000000001
oh sorry guys I'm nothing so

777.2 --> 783.46
as usual that I do seem to be having a

781.13 --> 788.6899999999999
lot of inner monologues but they're not

783.46 --> 793.2800000000001
ready to be translated into explanations

788.69 --> 796.4000000000001
yet it's just trying to feel out

793.28 --> 799.8199999999999
everything that's been happening recent

796.4 --> 804.5
times see how things are changing see

799.82 --> 807.1400000000001
how the media and the controlled media

804.5 --> 809.78
as well the The Mercenaries you could

807.14 --> 816.83
call them how they seem to be evolving

809.78 --> 819.8
and adapting and where they signal they

816.83 --> 823.5500000000001
want things to go and now there's of

819.8 --> 827.29
course the virtue signaling the

823.55 --> 830.03
corporate virtue signaling which yeah

827.29 --> 834.01
now apparently about that they have to

830.03 --> 837.79
do it that's good so that's a using

834.01 --> 842.11
honesty as comedy secretly that's good

837.79 --> 842.11
if you're a certain position and

844.759 --> 851.4300000000001
apparently I I'm pretty sure that the

849.06 --> 854.399
people that even did go along with that

851.43 --> 857.189
narrative contract you could call it

854.399 --> 859.339
that they are starting to feel the

857.189 --> 862.62
strain of it and that they are looking

859.339 --> 865.98
for they are trying to find a creative

862.62 --> 870.509
way out as it were out of out of that

865.98 --> 872.309
grip to get some real grip over the

870.509 --> 875.149
world because of course everybody's

872.309 --> 879.18
getting sick of it everybody's rejecting

875.149 --> 884.85
the narrative or they just rejecting or

879.18 --> 888.12
ignoring or just for a - signaling back

884.85 --> 892.16
and not really nobody really believes

888.12 --> 894.42
that [ __ ] anymore at this point the

892.16 --> 896.879
alternative media narratives have

894.42 --> 900.529
countered so many aspects of the

896.879 --> 904.41
mainstream the anti climate change

900.529 --> 906.47
issues the the alternative medicine in

904.41 --> 906.4699999999999
general

908.81 --> 916.04
the whole left-right paradigm

914.11 --> 918.77
enforcement because yeah there are

916.04 --> 923.3
people left there are people right very

918.77 --> 925.73
much so but it's there's attempts to

923.3 --> 929.27
real wrote these and to narrow things

925.73 --> 930.2
down and people aren't really responding

929.27 --> 932.66
to that either

930.2 --> 936.529
even among one another except for maybe

932.66 --> 939.5
the worst most brainwashed idiots on all

936.529 --> 942.25
sides which will always go with any

939.5 --> 947.18
baseline narrative because they simply

942.25 --> 949.85
don't have any grip on the situation so

947.18 --> 952.88
that just go with the baseline whatever

949.85 --> 957.8000000000001
that may be however true it may be or

952.88 --> 962.57
not but yeah everybody's getting aware

957.8 --> 969.3499999999999
of this and it's starting to come trust

962.57 --> 975.6800000000001
find an a personal position in

969.35 --> 978.5
opposition to the main narrative and you

975.68 --> 981.52
could call you could compare it to the

978.5 --> 986.8
main narrative the propaganda narrative

981.52 --> 991.72
that it's being worn as a cloak but that

986.8 --> 996.309
the real clothes are shown underneath

991.72 --> 997.989
every now and then because yeah the

996.309 --> 1000.8389999999999
people don't really like that cloak

997.989 --> 1006.119
anymore it's getting really boring and

1000.839 --> 1008.97
really useless in a pragmatic sense it's

1006.119 --> 1011.639
obviously just to control us just to

1008.97 --> 1013.139
manipulate us into slavery and people

1011.639 --> 1016.86
are seeing through it and they're like

1013.139 --> 1021.299
yeah that's really nice how you portray

1016.86 --> 1021.989
it but we don't really believe that

1021.299 --> 1026.569
anymore

1021.989 --> 1030.27
and we'll find our own ways to achieve

1026.569 --> 1033.529
the result that is proclaimed to come

1030.27 --> 1036.559
from the solution of the main narrative

1033.529 --> 1038.49
and we'll find a road way you know

1036.559 --> 1040.74
people that care about the environment

1038.49 --> 1047.22
will deal with the real issues people

1040.74 --> 1050.21
that care about Isis real social justice

1047.22 --> 1055.049
like real real equality the

1050.21 --> 1057.0900000000001
old-fashioned leftists from the 90s when

1055.049 --> 1062.8799999999999
that was still kind of normal and not so

1057.09 --> 1065.01
insane and Marxist yet yes many of these

1062.88 --> 1067.7990000000002
people have gone on the band with the

1065.01 --> 1071.1
new with the new narrative for pragmatic

1067.799 --> 1073.679
decisions but many are now stepping back

1071.1 --> 1075.6299999999999
because it's becoming tenable that's

1073.679 --> 1079.95
what and that's gonna happen even more

1075.63 --> 1085.1390000000001
the the contrast is gonna be so jarring

1079.95 --> 1087.3600000000001
so unreal that it's gonna become more

1085.139 --> 1091.37
and more antenna before most people and

1087.36 --> 1097.5
only the most shamelessly adapting

1091.37 --> 1099.51
soulless people can still fit the

1097.5 --> 1101.25
complete narrative as it is going to

1099.51 --> 1103.649
become while all people that still

1101.25 --> 1105.87
really are funny still have souls still

1103.649 --> 1109.11
have real intelligence and creativity

1105.87 --> 1111.299
they'll just lose grip on this kostik

1109.11 --> 1113.1899999999998
because it's become into its

1111.299 --> 1117.179
becoming more and more intolerable to

1113.19 --> 1122.249
people who do have a personality I

1117.179 --> 1126.21
really do have a conscious and they'll

1122.249 --> 1128.429
find their own way their own angle to it

1126.21 --> 1131.309
all and it it will be kind of

1128.429 --> 1134.159
interesting to see because in a sense

1131.309 --> 1137.07
the public the ones that really do have

1134.159 --> 1144.029
the conscious for it they will be able

1137.07 --> 1147.899
to see these media personalities slowly

1144.029 --> 1149.789
climb out of the situation and that's an

1147.899 --> 1152.309
interesting process to follow it's like

1149.789 --> 1155.519
okay this guy had this comedian I have

1152.309 --> 1158.85
always liked him let's see how he gets

1155.519 --> 1163.759
out of this or how he responds to to

1158.85 --> 1166.759
this narrative and yeah can be amusing

1163.759 --> 1166.759
anyway

1171.52 --> 1174.3899999999999
hmm

1186.51 --> 1193.97
seeing a lot of trolls in chat here

1189.92 --> 1193.97
trolls trollish

1201.58 --> 1209.499
now you guys must be starved of flat

1205.239 --> 1213.159
earth debate more than ever now usually

1209.499 --> 1216.369
everyone after the New Year celebration

1213.159 --> 1220.929
has a some kind of dip one way or the

1216.369 --> 1223.619
other so you guys must be more tense

1220.929 --> 1223.6190000000001
than ever now

1226.57 --> 1233.1299999999999
so you just hanging around my chapter 8

1229.48 --> 1233.13
oh well

1249.68 --> 1253.51
so have you sweat

1265.04 --> 1271.49
it's really odds when I've been wearing

1268.16 --> 1273.5900000000001
down drag for such a long time and I've

1271.49 --> 1275.72
learned all these routines on how to

1273.59 --> 1278.27
handle it without getting stuck on that

1275.72 --> 1279.74
kind of nonsense and now it's weird to

1278.27 --> 1282.8899999999999
just putting on these things like oh

1279.74 --> 1285.02
wait no that's that's no longer the case

1282.89 --> 1287.0900000000001
I could just put it out and without any

1285.02 --> 1287.92
effort I don't have to think about it

1287.09 --> 1296.36
anymore

1287.92 --> 1304.3700000000001
it's weird how that works wow I got 872

1296.36 --> 1309.3799999999999
subscribers now so thanks everyone that

1304.37 --> 1312.4099999999999
has been subscribing this night and the

1309.38 --> 1317.1200000000001
last week thank you so much for all your

1312.41 --> 1318.98
support and yeah please share this show

1317.12 --> 1321.4399999999998
on your favorite social media where you

1318.98 --> 1323.74
think people might be interested in my

1321.44 --> 1323.74
show

1346.11 --> 1352.6799999999998
it's kind of tough to even talk about

1349.23 --> 1356.34
flat earth or flat earth and ballers on

1352.68 --> 1358.8
your own it is quite obvious that the

1356.34 --> 1363.9599999999998
entire situation is pretty much at a

1358.8 --> 1370.4099999999999
stalemate and not in the sense of whose

1363.96 --> 1373.07
argument is greater but in that the

1370.41 --> 1375.96
possibilities for interactions now are

1373.07 --> 1379.9199999999998
becoming severely limited because the

1375.96 --> 1383.16
ballers are now railroading themselves

1379.92 --> 1384.8700000000001
in a certain deflection mode and there's

1383.16 --> 1387.3600000000001
really nothing you can do with it it's

1384.87 --> 1390.06
just like any time we bring up anything

1387.36 --> 1392.7299999999998
that's reasonable that's really worth

1390.06 --> 1396.36
looking into that could be an argument

1392.73 --> 1398.07
for or against the globe then we're

1396.36 --> 1401.55
gonna just gonna be slapped around with

1398.07 --> 1405.27
a red herrings and it's become

1401.55 --> 1408.81
instinctive to them in the sense that

1405.27 --> 1412.56
they do it and if you then say they do

1408.81 --> 1414.57
it they're just jumbled because they

1412.56 --> 1416.94
don't even realize they are red herring

1414.57 --> 1419.73
it because it's become automated this

1416.94 --> 1422.4
process there all of the ballers are so

1419.73 --> 1425.13
used just deflecting arguments because

1422.4 --> 1429.96
it's become second nature spill it's

1425.13 --> 1431.3200000000002
part of what they have to do to stay a

1429.96 --> 1434.5
global

1431.32 --> 1437.83
so instinct are taking over with their

1434.5 --> 1440.59
red herring tactics and the straw man's

1437.83 --> 1444.96
and all that and it's starting to bypass

1440.59 --> 1444.9599999999998
their conscious and that's very sad

1447.57 --> 1453.54
sorry Sam because they'll be escaping

1451.11 --> 1460.52
further and further deeper and deeper

1453.54 --> 1460.52
into their set minds

1463.57 --> 1469.3899999999999
flexibility will be more difficult to

1467.21 --> 1469.39
achieve

1472.39 --> 1479.26
I don't know this is overall what I see

1476.23 --> 1482.53
and yeah this only soleal you can talk

1479.26 --> 1484.36
about in this kind of setup because yeah

1482.53 --> 1487.809
we can just bring forth all the

1484.36 --> 1491.04
arguments all one by one you know

1487.809 --> 1491.04
where's the curvature

1493.38 --> 1499.2800000000002
bring this proof of terrestrial

1495.049 --> 1499.28
refraction that actually works

1500.48 --> 1508.23
presupposition of the physicality the

1504.12 --> 1511.02
glow of the heavens when you presuppose

1508.23 --> 1515.96
that the earth is a ball underneath that

1511.02 --> 1515.96
they are in between it basically and

1518.52 --> 1523.73
vacuum next to atmosphere

1523.83 --> 1529.77
that how does that work

1526.26 --> 1531.6
how can you have a vacuum next to a

1529.77 --> 1532.23
container without a membrane of some

1531.6 --> 1536.6599999999999
kind

1532.23 --> 1543.09
to stop the entropy from setting in and

1536.66 --> 1546.41
yeah the multimeric our fantasy for

1543.09 --> 1551.1
which we have so lovely paintings in old

1546.41 --> 1555.69
encyclopedias and yeah and the more

1551.1 --> 1557.6399999999999
modernized 3d renderings that are used

1555.69 --> 1565.71
as a demonstration in the modern age

1557.64 --> 1568.25
right now and are where where's it come

1565.71 --> 1568.25
from are

1576.77 --> 1582.93
so let's see and Jeff

this like this yeah

1862.35 --> 1873.1499999999999
burned out to rock it on the roof here

1873.15 --> 1882.93
satellite it's yet Sputnik I can say yes

I can say neces logo one day really but

1882.93 --> 1887.3300000000002
there you see the satellite and the

1884.61 --> 1891.05
rocket didn't so yeah they're all right

1887.33 --> 1895.9399999999998
actually cashing in on the cultural

1891.05 --> 1895.94
aspect with the fireworks even more

1897.71 --> 1903.0900000000001
marketing yeah the weird thing is

1900.03 --> 1905.43
there's like very very basic crackers

1903.09 --> 1908.6399999999999
you know like super basic just gunpowder

1905.43 --> 1911.73
crackers and the funny thing is is that

1908.64 --> 1912.8400000000001
when I was a young kid the general name

1911.73 --> 1918.51
for these things

1912.84 --> 1924.06
yeah we're astronauts naturally we call

1918.51 --> 1926.4
them astronauts like small crackers just

1924.06 --> 1927.96
remember that now oh yeah that's a good

1926.4 --> 1930.17
night mmm that's a good that's a good

1927.96 --> 1937.92
night for ya

1930.17 --> 1941.3300000000002
like the fuse and you blow them up do

1937.92 --> 1946.1200000000001
you guys do you guys have a traditional

1941.33 --> 1949.49
Dutch song that you sing for new you you

1946.12 --> 1949.4899999999998
[Music]

1949.61 --> 1955.85
do you guys have a traditional Dutch

1952.32 --> 1959.84
song that you sing for the new year nope

1955.85 --> 1965.9299999999998
you'd only know now we have traditional

1959.84 --> 1970.47
cabaret cabaret yes with dancing girls

1965.93 --> 1972.8700000000001
no cabaret as in stand-up comedy a guide

1970.47 --> 1976.5
that does a the new year's conference

1972.87 --> 1978.6399999999999
and it's different people every time

1976.5 --> 1984.64
although it's usually is

1978.64 --> 1987.75
a pic from certain types and it's just a

1984.64 --> 1991.39
stand-up comedy kind of thing but yeah a

1987.75 --> 1993.64
bigger story that these people will

1991.39 --> 1996.8500000000001
often have worked on all year long and

1993.64 --> 2000.0600000000002
I'm just crafting together typical news

1996.85 --> 2003.1799999999998
items and making jokes with all yeah

2000.06 --> 2004.44
that's that's that tradition it's it's

2003.18 --> 2006.0600000000002
been happening for as long as I could

2004.44 --> 2008.67
remember I always look forward to it

2006.06 --> 2010.9199999999998
although this is buddy I didn't find it

2008.67 --> 2013.98
all that amusing and it's been worse

2010.92 --> 2019.3100000000002
though but sometimes there's like really

2013.98 --> 2022.83
really awesome awesome versions of it

2019.31 --> 2026.04
where just they totally hit the snare on

2022.83 --> 2027.48
everything but yeah that's what the

2026.04 --> 2034.07
Dutch do we don't have a song that

2027.48 --> 2034.07
everybody sings we we have like from

2035.83 --> 2041.1399999999999
one and a half hour before the midnight

2037.99 --> 2044.59
up into 50 minutes to midnight there is

2041.14 --> 2046.51
that it's always been that and everybody

2044.59 --> 2049.0299999999997
tunes in I did too

2046.51 --> 2051.6
and yeah that's typically Dutch that's

2049.03 --> 2056.4700000000003
what what I'm used to

2051.6 --> 2058.39
how about you particular I look you know

2056.47 --> 2060.1899999999996
it's just a typical hotline science song

2058.39 --> 2061.75
that gets sung at some places but I

2060.19 --> 2062.56
think that's on its way out but many

2061.75 --> 2064.75
people do that

2062.56 --> 2067.63
well not many of the parties I've been

2064.75 --> 2068.74
to did I do that it's usually a bunch of

2067.63 --> 2073.03
friends getting together we have a

2068.74 --> 2074.35
barbecue going you know a situation went

2073.03 --> 2078.8500000000004
then to the beach and hit some fish and

2074.35 --> 2081.5099999999998
chips and then it got really windy so we

2078.85 --> 2085.72
left at the beach into a friend's place

2081.51 --> 2088.6490000000003
well we didn't sing any songs I was

2085.72 --> 2092.98
hoping to hear a traditional Dutch

2088.649 --> 2094.72
celebratory song for the new year but

2092.98 --> 2096.4900000000002
doesn't the sense look you don't do them

2094.72 --> 2101.6499999999996
neither no I don't think they're even

2096.49 --> 2105.8799999999997
are any serious because my mother is

2101.65 --> 2109.1800000000003
musician raised from my grandmother it's

2105.88 --> 2112.65
time to be singing songs and thingies my

2109.18 --> 2115.66
grandmother used to love that stuff and

2112.65 --> 2118.42
but now their Christmas song yeah

2115.66 --> 2121.81
there's lots of those since sinter Klass

2118.42 --> 2124.57
songs huge amounts of those very

2121.81 --> 2127.48
old-fashioned though but no no New Year

2124.57 --> 2135.15
song that's doesn't exist nope okay

2127.48 --> 2135.15
just a lot of fireworks and the cabaret

2140.64 --> 2147.1099999999997
I think well maybe sometimes there's

2143.31 --> 2149.61
also like special orchestras organized I

2147.11 --> 2152.7000000000003
don't know if that happened this year

2149.61 --> 2156.57
probably but I do it during Christmas

2152.7 --> 2162.3599999999997
also it's like big orchestras yeah the

2156.57 --> 2165.1200000000003
Dutch the Netherlands does have a lot of

2162.36 --> 2169.94
musicians they really tried to be

2165.12 --> 2174.0899999999997
prominent at that so yeah

2169.94 --> 2182.36
Andre Rieu he's we say from yeah he's

2174.09 --> 2182.36
Dutch yeah thought so nice yeah he gets

2182.51 --> 2195.11
Tata but but he is like like not really

2192.33 --> 2202.95
old-fashioned classic it's like the more

2195.11 --> 2207.2400000000002
classic in a Coco style very distracting

2202.95 --> 2210.96
very detailed but not harmonically

2207.24 --> 2213.87
perfect to my taste anyways music detail

2210.96 --> 2216.06
but ya ever hear he's been at it for a

2213.87 --> 2220.17
while and he's just he know he's good

2216.06 --> 2222.75
and what he does yeah yes he does sound

2220.17 --> 2225.92
good yeah he's quite famous a popular

2222.75 --> 2225.92
over here - mm-hm

2227.96 --> 2234.65
but what about you look your happy

2232.35 --> 2237.81
birthday song do you guys have something

2234.65 --> 2239.04

2239.04 --> 2245.73
Dutch one you have a Dutch one yeah

now I'm not gonna sing it but that's the

2256.109 --> 2267.089
song but I bet if you freestyle rap it

2260.49 --> 2269.25
could you do there no okay

2267.089 --> 2272.869
I'm not much of a singer either no I

2269.25 --> 2277.619
could but I'm not just gonna sing it

2272.869 --> 2282.15
that's it we don't have the occasion I

2277.619 --> 2284.28
might sing it on my own birthday all

2282.15 --> 2289.5
right you could sing it for Jason wait a

2284.28 --> 2294.9
month and five days for that set all

2289.5 --> 2296.94
right no I guess I'll have to wait -

2294.9 --> 2302.31
don't forget to sing it though in case

2350.85 --> 2354.7999999999997
the conspiracy police knocking at your

2352.44 --> 2358.13
door no not really

2354.8 --> 2358.13
it's just

2359.93 --> 2364.49
I don't think it's really illegal but

2362.63 --> 2366.02
it's just the way that you deal with

2364.49 --> 2372.74
that and come on it's a time of

2366.02 --> 2375.349
celebration you know yeah like I would

2372.74 --> 2377.029
never like light over joined in every

2375.349 --> 2380.15
single session or that kind of stuff

2377.029 --> 2384.38
because I don't like to do that I don't

2380.15 --> 2386.39
like to shove that in people's faces

2384.38 --> 2390.079
there may be people out there that are

2386.39 --> 2393.71
trying to quit smoking and that will be

2390.079 --> 2396.71
very distracting or even painful to them

2393.71 --> 2399.079
so sorry for being such a goody

2396.71 --> 2402.41
two-shoes but yeah it's just no I don't

2399.079 --> 2405.319
do that it's not my thing I never really

2402.41 --> 2412.3089999999997
I I kind of should have stopped smoking

2405.319 --> 2415.849
a long time so I don't know I I don't

2412.309 --> 2419.059
really like like smoking tobacco and I

2415.849 --> 2423.02
don't really like smoking in public on

2419.059 --> 2425.7200000000003
average yes sorry personal thing it's

2423.02 --> 2428.059
just like when I smoke I do it with

2425.72 --> 2429.7099999999996
myself usually or with somebody that I

2428.059 --> 2431.779
have a really deep conversation with

2429.71 --> 2435.41
that can be very amusing but that that's

2431.779 --> 2438.559
special yeah don't suppose our

2435.41 --> 2442.24
conversations deep enough hmm I don't

2438.559 --> 2442.2400000000002
suppose our conversation is deep enough

2447.94 --> 2454.9700000000003
it's not bad no but you will ask these

2452.329 --> 2457.279
and questions and at least you're

2454.97 --> 2460.0099999999998
obviously trying to help out and keeping

2457.279 --> 2461.9
the show running well the questions I've

2460.01 --> 2464.23
got the questions I was asking yesterday

2461.9 --> 2466.819
weren't getting addressed properly

2464.23 --> 2468.589
plus there was so many people jumping in

2466.819 --> 2470.75
on top of me I didn't get a chance to

2468.589 --> 2475.13
finish a few of my sentences or alright

2470.75 --> 2477.2
my statements and it felt like I was

2475.13 --> 2480.799
being pulled by the hand down different

2477.2 --> 2481.91
parts could be but anyway that I mean

2480.799 --> 2483.819
that happens when you have a discussion

2481.91 --> 2485.75
with with with a group of people

2483.819 --> 2487.099
especially when you've got different

2485.75 --> 2488.32
opinions that you're talking about

2487.099 --> 2490.3900000000003
mm-hmm

2488.32 --> 2493.77
yeah I guess you gotta be a little

2490.39 --> 2496.45
flexible with what you're trying to say

2493.77 --> 2498.55
well I guess I'll just put the brake on

2496.45 --> 2500.2599999999998
everything every time with a bigger

2498.55 --> 2503.4700000000003
panel - oh sorry I just gotta let it

2500.26 --> 2505.2400000000002
roll yeah what if there's points you

2503.47 --> 2509.14
think that you couldn't have brought

2505.24 --> 2511.24
across them by all means you know you

2509.14 --> 2512.7999999999997
have all the space right now so if

2511.24 --> 2515.29

2512.8 --> 2518.38
wasn't communicated across I was sort

2515.29 --> 2520.9
sort of in the moments things I was

2518.38 --> 2522.52

2520.9 --> 2528.85

I mean outside this is not in the show

2645.24 --> 2650.5499999999997
as much it was it seemed like that was

2649.17 --> 2654.0
quite noisy last night

2650.55 --> 2659.96
hi every day yeah constantly like a war

2654.0 --> 2663.3
is it yeah yeah the build-up to that is

2659.96 --> 2666.05
from a month or people start doing that

2663.3 --> 2669.1800000000003
kind of [ __ ] but just very sporadically

2666.05 --> 2672.9300000000003
two three days ago when people really

2669.18 --> 2675.8999999999996
start to regularly light off stuff to

2672.93 --> 2677.7
six o'clock in the evening where the

2675.9 --> 2679.53
[ __ ] really starts to hit the fan and

2677.7 --> 2682.3199999999997
people are bringing out the big boxes

2679.53 --> 2684.9300000000003
with the mortars and everything wait and

2682.32 --> 2686.76
hope I get building up until 12:00 and

2684.93 --> 2689.3689999999997
then everybody just goes totally nuts

2686.76 --> 2693.63
for a half hour to an hour this time

2689.369 --> 2696.0
yeah they they went nuts pretty much

2693.63 --> 2699.42
consistently to the same level up to one

2696.0 --> 2703.88
o'clock and it kept on going and raging

2699.42 --> 2709.29
dying down slightly at half past one and

2703.88 --> 2714.06
almost entirely dying off at 2:00 so but

2709.29 --> 2716.31
yeah I was so um where do you get your

2714.06 --> 2716.94
fireworks from you just bought a shot do

2716.31 --> 2721.5
ya

2716.94 --> 2725.01
there are specials permissions to sell

2721.5 --> 2725.88
fireworks like from three days in

2725.01 --> 2730.23
advance

2725.88 --> 2733.859
so similar to alcohol I suppose you need

2730.23 --> 2736.28
to pay me to sell it yeah also because

2733.859 --> 2739.589
of safety regulations and everything and

2736.28 --> 2743.5800000000004
yes the legality checks on the firework

2739.589 --> 2745.589
types so yeah you have to get a pyramid

2743.58 --> 2753.5699999999997
and yeah there's a lot of profit in it

2745.589 --> 2756.45
so sorry right you're gonna love this in

2753.57 --> 2759.3590000000004
Australia fireworks are illegal except

2756.45 --> 2761.31
for one place which is Canberra in

2759.359 --> 2764.43
Canberra you can legally buy fireworks

2761.31 --> 2767.94
cameras did Capital Territory the

2764.43 --> 2769.109
capital of Australia right and this

2767.94 --> 2769.809
world Apollo that's where all the

2769.109 --> 2771.64
politician

2769.809 --> 2776.219
live so it's the only place in Australia

2771.64 --> 2780.339
let's blow fireworks and porn that

2776.219 --> 2786.699
doesn't make any damn sense no no right

2780.339 --> 2788.259
that's so um we don't we don't have

2786.699 --> 2792.339
fireworks like you guys do

2788.259 --> 2795.789
what like everyone with their ability to

2792.339 --> 2798.4
go out by from the shop we don't have

2795.789 --> 2804.099
that no we're not even in there right

2798.4 --> 2808.449
before this isn't here just just in that

2804.099 --> 2810.069
chamber oh I've got someone but which

2808.449 --> 2812.0190000000002
the black is in Northern Territory

2810.069 --> 2818.499
saying that they can do it up there on

2812.019 --> 2820.7189999999996
this one particular day yeah crazy laws

2818.499 --> 2822.479
here we used to have him if when I was a

2820.719 --> 2825.64
kid when I was young

2822.479 --> 2827.4689999999996
many decades ago it was some we could

2825.64 --> 2831.549
buy on the show but not anymore they

2827.469 --> 2833.619
outlawed it it sounds from there so I

2831.549 --> 2835.359
got a weird story for you it's been a

2833.619 --> 2837.549
while though so I don't know if it works

2835.359 --> 2843.869
exactly like this anymore but a long

2837.549 --> 2843.869
time ago I think was 2000

2844.79 --> 2850.39
yeah 2010 man zoo nine years ago

2848.12 --> 2850.39
ah

2852.68 --> 2861.98
no I lost track what I was gonna say

2858.01 --> 2864.0800000000004
what about the one about the toilets

2861.98 --> 2869.68
been made illegal right right right

2864.08 --> 2872.99
right yeah I went to Belgium to visit

2869.68 --> 2876.2
yeah I was very tight with a friend at

2872.99 --> 2880.79
that time also I showed the fireworks

2876.2 --> 2882.68
video that I recorded from 2011 that was

2880.79 --> 2887.0299999999997
at the same friends but the year before

2882.68 --> 2889.16
I went with them in Belgium where they

2887.03 --> 2892.57
were visiting family and was really

2889.16 --> 2895.7
weird there because we had fireworks and

2892.57 --> 2898.67
everybody seemed to like it that was

2895.7 --> 2902.5699999999997
living there but nobody had fireworks

2898.67 --> 2906.4700000000003
but us because it was illegal for them

2902.57 --> 2910.3
as a citizen there you weren't allowed

2906.47 --> 2914.4199999999996
to buy it or or use it or lighted only

2910.3 --> 2915.8300000000004
tourists so we were tourists coming from

2914.42 --> 2919.1
the Netherlands and we were allowed to

2915.83 --> 2922.97
do that but the citizens that were

2919.1 --> 2927.95
basically standing around were not this

2922.97 --> 2933.1
bananas yeah I thought it's like that's

2927.95 --> 2935.8999999999996
totally insane doesn't make any sense

2933.1 --> 2939.5299999999997
felt really nervous like okay this is

2935.9 --> 2942.46
freaky mate hey make sure you got your

3215.84 --> 3227.9700000000003
apologizing for yes yeah yeah that's

3219.99 --> 3230.3399999999997
fine yeah I need to apologize huh

3227.97 --> 3231.87
Whistler's yeah I was gonna say

3230.34 --> 3234.9
watership down didn't there's a new

3231.87 --> 3238.71
movie when we're talking about rabbit

3234.9 --> 3244.02
warrens no yeah have you seen the new

3238.71 --> 3247.23
movie I haven't seen the old maybe the

3244.02 --> 3252.5099999999998
old movie is is special it's like very

3247.23 --> 3257.4
artsy but the new movie seems to not be

3252.51 --> 3259.5
as bad like it could be worse I haven't

3257.4 --> 3262.58
really seen it just seen snippets of it

3259.5 --> 3266.04
and I was looking very interesting it's

3262.58 --> 3267.87
it's a bit of it was animated and maybe

3266.04 --> 3270.96
the first one he said that was yeah

3267.87 --> 3275.13
pattern yeah and it was a bit of a

3270.96 --> 3278.73
tearjerker not here bit was a hard to

3275.13 --> 3283.83
rancher okay well diverse almost like

3278.73 --> 3286.02
really harsh like really like getting

3283.83 --> 3291.5099999999998
really close up and in your face about

3286.02 --> 3295.44
panic and death and it was very serious

3291.51 --> 3297.5400000000004
movies like you can't show a movie like

3295.44 --> 3299.4900000000002
with the original watership down to a

3297.54 --> 3301.92
kid without accompanying them and

3299.49 --> 3304.02
basically like how bracing them for

3301.92 --> 3310.44
certain things because it is really

3304.02 --> 3313.41
psycho sometimes and bloody as [ __ ] torn

3310.44 --> 3316.44
apart in that [ __ ] it's really creepy

3313.41 --> 3318.3199999999997
sometimes and this was sold as the kids

3316.44 --> 3322.14
maybe was it at the time

3318.32 --> 3325.05
well I'm glad I miss don't know I didn't

3322.14 --> 3330.0
I saw it and it impressed me greatly and

3325.05 --> 3330.57
it really I took it but it was very

3330.0 --> 3331.65
scary

3330.57 --> 3337.71
yep

3331.65 --> 3340.56
how old were you I think I was nine or

3337.71 --> 3343.89
something when I first saw that under

3340.56 --> 3346.56
company of my parents and you need to

3343.89 --> 3350.4
have any cried and she had you think it

3346.56 --> 3353.04
had a profound effect on you yeah this

3350.4 --> 3356.01
is still when you think about well one

3353.04 --> 3360.3
of the things that entire movie did it's

3356.01 --> 3365.9100000000003
made me aware of the group instinct to

3360.3 --> 3367.77
survive because that's what it is mostly

3365.91 --> 3371.52
about it is really about that group

3367.77 --> 3373.56
surviving and just going out in a very

3371.52 --> 3378.06
dangerous world where they are not the

3373.56 --> 3380.46
top where they yeah where they are being

3378.06 --> 3384.15
hunted being killed for no reason to

3380.46 --> 3386.46
them apparently and they had the drive

3384.15 --> 3388.9500000000003
to survive and that's what that movie is

3386.46 --> 3395.46
about and that part about it inspired me

3388.95 --> 3401.48
greatly but it is very cruel it's a very

3395.46 --> 3401.48
cruel movie I'm glad I missed it

3405.819 --> 3413.0099999999998
I'd watch it

3408.75 --> 3418.89
yeah maybe I'll watch it now right the

3413.01 --> 3421.71
IDIS as an adult movie it'll be a lot

3418.89 --> 3423.66
yeah a deeper there's more ways to look

3421.71 --> 3426.21
at it hmm

3423.66 --> 3428.67
anyway yeah the new movie seems to be

3426.21 --> 3432.09
available on Netflix often staring at

3428.67 --> 3438.27
that and it is like a 3d animated movie

3432.09 --> 3440.04
that looks really pretty good oh great

3438.27 --> 3441.599
nan you're all cheering can have the

3440.04 --> 3444.75
blood and go right in the face

3441.599 --> 3448.1400000000003
it's very day now I don't think that

3444.75 --> 3451.74
this movie is as gory this is the new is

3448.14 --> 3453.93
it and they took away some of the

3451.74 --> 3459.1189999999997
harsher elements I think of the old one

3453.93 --> 3461.19
and made it more suitable so they can

3459.119 --> 3464.4900000000002
get through the writing's system I think

3461.19 --> 3466.7400000000002
so I'll appeal I'm not 100% sure no but

3464.49 --> 3471.7799999999997
from the trailer that I've seen it that

3466.74 --> 3474.75
you don't see like serious war but I

3471.78 --> 3478.05
don't know it's a 3d movie like 3d

3474.75 --> 3479.82
animation yeah it's gonna be very

3478.05 --> 3482.849
different from the first one and yeah I

3479.82 --> 3486.78
will look at look at it maybe later this

3482.849 --> 3488.46
evening or something I don't know but

3486.78 --> 3500.01
yeah it's it's there for the clicking

3488.46 --> 3504.2
for me right now so yeah watership down

3500.01 --> 3504.2000000000003
horns and rabbits

3508.25 --> 3518.44
I need a character's names in that world

3512.29 --> 3518.44
okay yeah there's fiver bigwig and

3519.64 --> 3525.0789999999997
that's pretty much what I remember

3521.96 --> 3528.43
there's oh yeah hazel of course yes the

3525.079 --> 3533.6600000000003
names of these rabbits are all based on

3528.43 --> 3537.8289999999997
shrubberies and plants and not that kind

3533.66 --> 3540.5299999999997
of thing those are the names of the main

3537.829 --> 3544.069
characters their names

3540.53 --> 3544.9100000000003
okay so not none of my nuts or bushes or

3544.069 --> 3546.8
that kind of thing

3544.91 --> 3551.8999999999996
cuz I always thought if I had a pet

3546.8 --> 3552.4700000000003
rabbit I'd name it Warren just wrote

3551.9 --> 3560.4500000000003
yeah

3552.47 --> 3563.569
a pond I know I just wandered off Nathan

3560.45 --> 3572.1189999999997
oh please in chat trying to would be

3563.569 --> 3575.81
Dave no Nathan I'm not trying to be you

3572.119 --> 3579.069
I hope you've noticed and I hope you

3575.81 --> 3579.069
will share whenever they like ease

3585.7 --> 3596.1899999999996
but yeah any idea when you're gonna be

3589.51 --> 3596.19
starting up again Nathan thanks JJ

3598.73 --> 3603.44
see I told you out what the other day I

3600.83 --> 3605.12
was telling you how much people were

3603.44 --> 3606.56
talking about your show insane how much

3605.12 --> 3607.7599999999998
is better and I was trying to find it

3606.56 --> 3610.22
find it in the comments but it was

3607.76 --> 3623.42
actually in the live chat as you can see

3610.22 --> 3625.91
here today it is a fake Nathan I'm fake

3623.42 --> 3627.8
yeah but the funny thing is in the well

3625.91 --> 3630.62
Nathan is would even the real long

3627.8 --> 3632.03
enough to say that at some point so it

3630.62 --> 3635.92
could have just as well been him

3632.03 --> 3640.4500000000003
trolling me but I guess that it is a a

3635.92 --> 3647.42
sock account posing as the real name

3640.45 --> 3649.22
smartass but yeah I have been getting

3647.42 --> 3653.62
compliments from lots of people about

3649.22 --> 3653.62
the show and the way I conduct it and

3653.74 --> 3662.5099999999998
it's different I have a different focus

3659.41 --> 3666.23
mainly trying to uphold the energy level

3662.51 --> 3668.42
and not so much the formatting because I

3666.23 --> 3671.54
think that Nathan and the debates are

3668.42 --> 3675.8
very much focused on the on the hard

3671.54 --> 3678.71
edges on the hardcore [ __ ] the the

3675.8 --> 3682.1000000000004
proofs the scientific method and just

3678.71 --> 3684.65
hammering on that stuff and though I

3682.1 --> 3687.3199999999997
accept that it's not the focus really of

3684.65 --> 3690.44
this show not really it will be if

3687.32 --> 3694.46
somebody gets all zealous and starts to

3690.44 --> 3697.55
try to push religion their views on me

3694.46 --> 3699.89
without back yeah a claiming proof and

3697.55 --> 3702.0800000000004
all that then yeah I will do the same

3699.89 --> 3705.1299999999997
thing I will shuffle sleeping questions

3702.08 --> 3707.72
in your face but as long as you're just

3705.13 --> 3709.78
having a nice conversation we can talk

3707.72 --> 3712.3599999999997
about many aspects of

3709.78 --> 3714.3500000000004
heliocentric model or the Flat Earth

3712.36 --> 3717.83
conceptualization or the mainstream

3714.35 --> 3720.2599999999998
media or well your Oliverio yeah

3717.83 --> 3723.56
anything and there's not gonna be any

3720.26 --> 3727.84
need to basically get hostile or

3723.56 --> 3729.59
offensive that's right that's how

3727.84 --> 3731.06
religion can be seen as an

3729.59 --> 3731.9900000000002
indoctrination system and when that

3731.06 --> 3734.69
argument works the

3731.99 --> 3748.25
as well it is more suspect no but it is

3734.69 --> 3750.8
it is part of religion noises big part

3748.25 --> 3754.79
of all religions and what makes religion

3750.8 --> 3761.26
reveal a religion is anyway I trained

3754.79 --> 3763.13
acceptance of certain beliefs so

3761.26 --> 3765.11
indoctrination is all over the place

3763.13 --> 3770.78
really if you want to argue

3765.11 --> 3772.82
indoctrination if even the you know by I

3770.78 --> 3777.26
was thinking of that it Annina why even

3772.82 --> 3780.71
the what are you calling the air

3777.26 --> 3782.78
escaping rules that's that's a that's a

3780.71 --> 3785.69
form of indoctrination is he look at it

3782.78 --> 3787.75
if you look at it clearly how where did

3785.69 --> 3790.369
I come from

3787.75 --> 3792.83
where do the housekeeping questions come

3790.369 --> 3797.6000000000004
from yes that's what I don't know where

3792.83 --> 3800.119
they come from precisely physics they

3797.6 --> 3802.4
come from the laws of nature they come

3800.119 --> 3805.369
from so that's all things said that's

3802.4 --> 3808.94
what they're that's all into part of the

3805.369 --> 3812.23
bigger indoctrination argument and what

3808.94 --> 3814.73
they're doing and what they were doing

3812.23 --> 3819.38
hold on was we're using the real

3814.73 --> 3824.2
confirmed Sciences as accepted as accept

3819.38 --> 3826.94
okay okay hold on I'm not done yet and

3824.2 --> 3830.6299999999997
then we are putting all these parts

3826.94 --> 3833.9900000000002
together and just showing what can be

3830.63 --> 3837.9700000000003
and what cannot be and why and that is

3833.99 --> 3837.97
what the housekeeping questions are for

3839.0 --> 3846.77
okay and of course the principle core

3843.88 --> 3850.1800000000003
the core system of actually

3846.77 --> 3852.14
scientifically proving things and

3850.18 --> 3857.6
presuppositions all that it's all part

3852.14 --> 3859.8799999999997
of that that structure so Bart's losing

3857.6 --> 3862.25
the known knowledge the knowns are watch

3859.88 --> 3865.34
to show why certain things certain that

3862.25 --> 3870.01
beats so by putting those housekeeping

3865.34 --> 3873.4700000000003
so-called housekeeping rules out using

3870.01 --> 3876.92
the way that they're spoken like that

3873.47 --> 3880.91
words used to depict what they say or

3876.92 --> 3883.82
are meant to do that too is in a piece

3880.91 --> 3886.7799999999997
is a form of indoctrination it can be

3883.82 --> 3891.38
but it could be argued no why not

3886.78 --> 3893.15
because what are you indoctrinating well

3891.38 --> 3897.37
are you trying to get people to think in

3893.15 --> 3897.37
a particular way using that set of rules

3899.08 --> 3905.42
well in doctor watching what is being

3902.75 --> 3908.54
somebody a program or a set way of

3905.42 --> 3911.87
thinking that's what you select other

3908.54 --> 3914.0
things yeah that's just what I said it's

3911.87 --> 3916.3399999999997
giving something to replace and ignore

3914.0 --> 3917.75
other things yeah that's exactly what

3916.34 --> 3920.9
it's doing it's not what we're doing

3917.75 --> 3922.97
we're expose your thing of being kept

3920.9 --> 3925.79
hidden that's what we're doing we're

3922.97 --> 3928.3999999999996
exposing it yeah we also using what is

3925.79 --> 3930.65
hidden and what is painful to all of you

3928.4 --> 3932.69
religious beliefs Wow let's talk my

3930.65 --> 3933.4100000000003
thanks yeah come when this is very

3932.69 --> 3936.02
serious

3933.41 --> 3937.52
I don't you're suggesting something that

3936.02 --> 3939.89
is absolutely not true

3937.52 --> 3943.31
there is no indoctrination about

3939.89 --> 3947.21
exposing the truth you what I'm saying

3943.31 --> 3950.0
is you're using the same scheme as what

3947.21 --> 3952.18
you're claiming indoctrination does no

3950.0 --> 3954.62
that's not what indoctrination does

3952.18 --> 3957.62
indoctrination conceals the truth it

3954.62 --> 3960.29
does not reveal it when you refer you're

3957.62 --> 3962.95
using then you give the people an

3960.29 --> 3965.54
opportunity to escape indoctrination

3962.95 --> 3967.64
you're using a set of rules that have

3965.54 --> 3969.7599999999998
been taken from what you were saying

3967.64 --> 3972.1299999999997
before science and physics and you're

3969.76 --> 3975.8500000000004
you've reworded them to fear

3972.13 --> 3977.92
a particular structure which can be seen

3975.85 --> 3980.38
as indo-canadian to people yeah we are

3977.92 --> 3984.67
using the Foundation's that the baller

3980.38 --> 3987.9700000000003
religion has used originally to show

3984.67 --> 3989.92
them where the holes are that's what

3987.97 --> 3991.4199999999996
we're doing we're using them our system

3989.92 --> 3992.25
against you that's what we're doing

3991.42 --> 3995.2000000000003
that's right

3992.25 --> 3997.51
yeah to make people see or CIL's what

3995.2 --> 3999.73
your support you bite people you're

3997.51 --> 4004.4300000000003
trying to make people think that it is

3999.73 --> 4010.32
not a globe no we are revealing

4004.43 --> 4013.08
observations sights measurements that

4010.32 --> 4015.78
reveal that it cannot be a globe

4013.08 --> 4018.45
we're not indoctrinating anyone with

4015.78 --> 4023.51
Odin must be flat we're just showing you

4018.45 --> 4026.6699999999996
like look if it is a globe this can't be

4023.51 --> 4028.7400000000002
this should not be you should not be

4026.67 --> 4030.03
able to see things in a super far

4028.74 --> 4032.1299999999997
distance they should be completely

4030.03 --> 4035.7000000000003
concealed behind the curve and they're

4032.13 --> 4041.88
not on a regular occasion and no anomaly

4035.7 --> 4044.1899999999996
can cause that okay you you should never

4041.88 --> 4046.35
see them I don't agree yeah but that's

4044.19 --> 4048.7200000000003
no you don't agree you don't agree with

4046.35 --> 4055.0499999999997
the truth right right

4048.72 --> 4056.7599999999998
you don't agree you can't unknow they

4055.05 --> 4059.4900000000002
should have been behind the curve I

4056.76 --> 4063.4500000000003
don't agree with the way you guys have

4059.49 --> 4065.7599999999998
put it oh well sorry but semantic

4063.45 --> 4067.8599999999997
arguments is not really relevant in this

4065.76 --> 4070.38
case I'm talking about the actual

4067.86 --> 4073.29
hardcore facts we're not talking about

4070.38 --> 4076.5
semantics here sorry if I worded in a

4073.29 --> 4078.93
wrong way or if my tone it's you in the

4076.5 --> 4081.78
wrong way that's not doesn't it mean

4078.93 --> 4083.43
anyway well that's fine but the facts

4081.78 --> 4085.38
remain the facts and there is no

4083.43 --> 4087.83
indoctrination here it's just a

4085.38 --> 4087.83
revelation

4102.499 --> 4110.17
so yeah if you got any response to that

4106.839 --> 4110.17
let's hear it

4112.709 --> 4121.099
I think at any response work work work

4118.019 --> 4121.099
to what end

4124.12 --> 4131.7699999999995
to an end of understanding I'm sorry you

4127.42 --> 4134.86
think there's some misunderstanding hmm

4131.77 --> 4142.150000000001
I do okay

4134.86 --> 4143.82
from who a misunderstanding of the the

4142.15 --> 4146.139999999999
rules that you've made

4143.82 --> 4146.71
let me sunder stood where you've got

4146.14 --> 4149.5
them from

4146.71 --> 4152.86
yet misunderstood but I can't I can't

4149.5 --> 4155.71
explain them kids not you specifically

4152.86 --> 4158.71
oh you mean the body of science

4155.71 --> 4160.63
scientists it's more about the

4158.71 --> 4162.46
housekeeping questions Yeah right

4160.63 --> 4164.8
well these housekeeping questions are

4162.46 --> 4168.31
derived from science from the body of

4164.8 --> 4170.14
science from the laws of nature you know

4168.31 --> 4173.02
the laws of physics that's where they're

4170.14 --> 4176.530000000001
coming from so unless you are ready to

4173.02 --> 4180.85
declare that the entirety of physics

4176.53 --> 4185.32
everything everything to the most

4180.85 --> 4187.570000000001
fundamental basic in-your-face concept

4185.32 --> 4190.92
unless you're ready to just basically

4187.57 --> 4193.63
discard it all and say it's all useless

4190.92 --> 4197.92
well what made any sense for you to

4193.63 --> 4201.31
believe it for you to believe in things

4197.92 --> 4204.25
based on that same body of science but

4201.31 --> 4207.1900000000005
reject actual questions being asked

4204.25 --> 4210.13
through that body of science about what

4207.19 --> 4213.91
you do even that's very intellectually

4210.13 --> 4216.13
dishonest so to do that so the way you

4213.91 --> 4218.29
have reinterpreted the rules that you've

4216.13 --> 4220.12
made up from the body of science hope

4218.29 --> 4221.56
you cross-check them with the body of

4220.12 --> 4227.05
science to make sure that you've been

4221.56 --> 4229.51
taught it looked anything up we never

4227.05 --> 4232.03
compared it we haven't spent like half a

4229.51 --> 4233.95
year digging into this no we just made

4232.03 --> 4237.28
it up and we just assumed everything

4233.95 --> 4239.139999999999
from the that way all the it seems to me

4237.28 --> 4242.139999999999
this very case your understanding of a

4239.14 --> 4243.160000000001
sarcasm just so you know it seems to me

4242.14 --> 4244.75
that you've cherry picked your

4243.16 --> 4249.49
understanding of the rules and your

4244.75 --> 4252.34
heaven so what other cherry did we not

4249.49 --> 4254.8
pick that contradicts what we found was

4252.34 --> 4256.81
all right well then don't call it cherry

4254.8 --> 4257.4400000000005
picking because cherry picking suggests

4256.81 --> 4259.84
there

4257.44 --> 4262.48
any options to pick from and we picked

4259.84 --> 4265.27
the one specific one that fit our

4262.48 --> 4268.0
narrative but it's not the case so point

4265.27 --> 4270.4890000000005
at the other cherries that don't fit it

4268.0 --> 4275.04
that we skipped out on because I don't

4270.489 --> 4278.0199999999995
think there are any we picked the cherry

4275.04 --> 4281.14
okay well I'm not a scientist so I can't

4278.02 --> 4286.27
talk from that angle but I have heard a

4281.14 --> 4288.43
lot of people say that the opposite sure

4286.27 --> 4290.59
well if you want to call something

4288.43 --> 4292.33
cherry picking then point at the other

4290.59 --> 4295.96
cherries thank you very much otherwise

4292.33 --> 4299.65
please keep your baseless accusations

4295.96 --> 4302.4
and rumors behind the scenes because

4299.65 --> 4304.75
it's yeah doesn't make any sense

4302.4 --> 4308.86
you can't unknow something cherry

4304.75 --> 4310.84
picking unless you know what cherry

4308.86 --> 4315.299999999999
picking is and then point at the other

4310.84 --> 4315.3
cherries then I skipped off so

4316.53 --> 4319.34
it's useless

4319.68 --> 4324.71
pointment the other cherries are don't

4321.96 --> 4324.71
use that argument

4331.29 --> 4337.83
nothing personal no no I'm not like this

4335.85 --> 4340.870000000001
just don't like it

4337.83 --> 4343.63
people make that type of accusations and

4340.87 --> 4345.82
then can't actually back it up and just

4343.63 --> 4347.469
say yeah it's not my thing like somebody

4345.82 --> 4350.5
else is making that accusation you

4347.469 --> 4353.76
shouldn't nobody should be picking up

4350.5 --> 4356.77
arguments that they don't understand

4353.76 --> 4361.42
they don't even know where it's coming

4356.77 --> 4363.43
from I was just asking you if you if you

4361.42 --> 4366.52
have researched the rules that you'll

4363.43 --> 4370.900000000001
put it into your escaping rules yeah

4366.52 --> 4372.43
yeah yeah and her and who did you

4370.9 --> 4374.5
cross-reference them with other

4372.43 --> 4378.04
flat-earthers I suppose no I

4374.5 --> 4383.26
cross-referenced them a lot of online

4378.04 --> 4387.4
sites Wikipedia university libraries

4383.26 --> 4390.16
research pieces from scientists and now

4387.4 --> 4392.349999999999
I haven't really studied it meticulously

4390.16 --> 4393.36
like a word for a word that's not really

4392.35 --> 4395.7390000000005
what I'm good at

4393.36 --> 4397.75
damn all they're flat earth does that

4395.739 --> 4400.718999999999
have and that confirm certain things

4397.75 --> 4405.93
with me crossed referencing yeah this is

4400.719 --> 4409.11
just this is the case okay

4405.93 --> 4410.9400000000005
the the fun the foundation of the

4409.11 --> 4413.009999999999
housekeeping questions is in order

4410.94 --> 4415.759999999999
there's no floss there and there's flaws

4413.01 --> 4419.31
another approaches like for example the

4415.76 --> 4421.74
natural worlds in the scientific method

4419.31 --> 4424.8
the John method that I completely

4421.74 --> 4427.53
disagree with but yeah that's not part

4424.8 --> 4433.95
of the housekeeping really that's not in

4427.53 --> 4438.87
the questions itself it's a pity it's

4433.95 --> 4443.46
not more people on the panel what do you

4438.87 --> 4445.38
mean well to talk about any more data

4443.46 --> 4447.12
someone that's more scientifically

4445.38 --> 4453.75
minded than me or has more experience

4447.12 --> 4455.16
with these with these areas well I don't

4453.75 --> 4458.82
know I think you're pretty much as good

4455.16 --> 4460.5599999999995
as anyone because really Li yeah yeah I

4458.82 --> 4463.469999999999
think you are because many of these

4460.56 --> 4466.4400000000005
people that everyone presumes know so

4463.47 --> 4470.1900000000005
much usually are just very good at

4466.44 --> 4473.79
bluffing that they know so much okay and

4470.19 --> 4476.099999999999
being arrogant and making the ball sound

4473.79 --> 4477.9
really smart and Flat Earth sound really

4476.1 --> 4480.3
stupid that's what rumpus does that's

4477.9 --> 4485.67
what George netting you up does that's

4480.3 --> 4488.1900000000005
what the Laurie does okay but these are

4485.67 --> 4490.41
not smart people rumpus isn't really

4488.19 --> 4494.129999999999
that smart either it just it's very

4490.41 --> 4496.37
trained in trying to sound smart smart

4494.13 --> 4496.37
ass

4496.79 --> 4502.04
yeah I think that you're just being

4499.679 --> 4505.79
modest and I think you know plenty

4502.04 --> 4505.79
plenty about tomorrow

4507.78 --> 4517.11
so don't discount yourself but do keep

4512.4 --> 4520.5199999999995
on looking look into these housekeeping

4517.11 --> 4520.5199999999995
questions have you

4522.36 --> 4532.469999999999
well I've made my own observations

4526.52 --> 4536.490000000001
particularly off the sky and I've

4532.47 --> 4541.47
listened to Flat Earth explanations for

4536.49 --> 4547.83
what we see up the sky and they have to

4541.47 --> 4549.96
employ a lot more imagination they have

4547.83 --> 4556.62
to employ things that you can't simulate

4549.96 --> 4559.53
on the earth outer space here on the

4556.62 --> 4561.57
earth because I think that for the

4559.53 --> 4563.58
heliocentric concept of the heavens

4561.57 --> 4566.759999999999
there's a lot more you need to be

4563.58 --> 4568.47
imagining well you can go up there and

4566.76 --> 4571.26
see it and it's been done but I guess

4568.47 --> 4574.89
you could argue manie's you could but

4571.26 --> 4578.1
you don't so until that time where you

4574.89 --> 4579.93
could and you are going oh no it's all

4578.1 --> 4581.610000000001
gonna be in your imagination you just

4579.93 --> 4583.83
declared you need a lot of the

4581.61 --> 4587.67
imagination to imagine that on the Flat

4583.83 --> 4590.55
Earth well I'd say no it's very basic to

4587.67 --> 4592.59
imagine there's actually not too much to

4590.55 --> 4594.51
imagine about the globe of the heavens

4592.59 --> 4596.55
or contrast that with the outer space

4594.51 --> 4598.38
universe and other solar systems and

4596.55 --> 4601.1
planets and nebulas and nor the great

4598.38 --> 4603.93
mysteries aliens other like know the

4601.1 --> 4607.8
heliocentric model is where the

4603.93 --> 4610.02
imagination is found but you can you can

4607.8 --> 4614.9400000000005
you can measure what's going on above

4610.02 --> 4616.34
the atmosphere what are you talking

4614.94 --> 4623.0
about there is no above the

4616.34 --> 4626.8
this year radio waves etc there she came

4623.0 --> 4629.15
above there is no above the atmosphere

4626.8 --> 4631.400000000001
then there's what do you what do you

4629.15 --> 4636.5599999999995
mean there's no point where the

4631.4 --> 4639.138999999999
atmosphere ends can be or there it must

4636.56 --> 4642.099
be a barrier but there's no end to the

4639.139 --> 4645.82
atmosphere in the open really

4642.099 --> 4645.82
entropy doesn't allow that

4648.08 --> 4654.14
big swats here but there's not going to

4650.78 --> 4654.8
be an end to it a barrier into outer

4654.14 --> 4661.6
space

4654.8 --> 4661.6
no not naturally occurring anyway

4664.509 --> 4667.559
so what are you implying

4669.69 --> 4675.45
well that your suggestion of do

4673.17 --> 4679.59
something satellite whatever out of the

4675.45 --> 4681.69
atmosphere assumes that that is even

4679.59 --> 4685.2300000000005
possible that that can physically exist

4681.69 --> 4687.889999999999
and what's your what are you employing

4685.23 --> 4692.04
that does exist if that can't be done I

4687.89 --> 4694.89
told you I told you the show before hmm

4692.04 --> 4698.1
entropy doesn't allow a vacuum next to a

4694.89 --> 4700.05
pressurized system without a membrane so

4698.1 --> 4703.08
what's going to be happening up there no

4700.05 --> 4705.99
matter how far it reaches is the

4703.08 --> 4710.97
gradients the the pressure gradient is

4705.99 --> 4713.179999999999
gonna grow wider and wider and the

4710.97 --> 4719.67
thinning down of the atmosphere will

4713.18 --> 4722.34
gradually become wider in its reach so

4719.67 --> 4727.29
the higher up you go the slower the

4722.34 --> 4728.88
pressure gets less and less and this

4727.29 --> 4731.64
will continue on for a while but there's

4728.88 --> 4736.17
no point where it ends but it's gonna be

4731.64 --> 4739.1
zero pressure can't happen unless there

4736.17 --> 4739.1
is a physical barrier

4739.139 --> 4748.639
so the higher you go the wider the

4743.19 --> 4751.799999999999
layers become and a fiddle a become yes

4748.639 --> 4753.75
under pressure and there's no limit to

4751.8 --> 4758.04
how wide they can become and how thin

4753.75 --> 4760.699
they can become no there's no the layers

4758.04 --> 4763.739
don't know what they are and it's set

4760.699 --> 4767.46
because otherwise you'd be measuring

4763.739 --> 4769.919999999999
heavy heavy pressure shifts that it's

4767.46 --> 4774.3
not happening thank God but the layers

4769.92 --> 4777.119
will be where they are and the relative

4774.3 --> 4779.179
sizes of these layers will remain what

4777.119 --> 4781.92
they are but when you measure them up

4779.179 --> 4784.65
there is an asymptote that you can

4781.92 --> 4787.4890000000005
detect the higher you go the wider these

4784.65 --> 4790.379999999999
layers become and if you naturally

4787.489 --> 4798.11
progress that yeah it could potentially

4790.38 --> 4798.11
be infinitely long and infinitely thin

4799.219 --> 4805.249
not infinitely thin because there's it's

4803.479 --> 4812.269
a half-life system there's not gonna be

4805.249 --> 4815.449
a zero point not even close to them so

4812.269 --> 4818.659000000001
we can get to a point where it's so thin

4815.449 --> 4823.749
no you didn't listen there is not gonna

4818.659 --> 4823.749
be a zero point not even close their

4823.78 --> 4828.53
realization it's less it's simply gonna

4825.949 --> 4831.499
be faster so it's not nothing coming

4828.53 --> 4833.829
even close to that zero point not even

4831.499 --> 4833.829
close

4836.26 --> 4842.329000000001
say if you had to measure it

4838.249 --> 4845.499
what would you say could get to depends

4842.329 --> 4849.768999999999
on how high you go compared to say level

4845.499 --> 4852.438999999999
and it's atomized riches let's just say

4849.769 --> 4856.219
you could go up a hundred million

4852.439 --> 4858.469
kilometres well I would estimate that

4856.219 --> 4864.32
the pressure and a hundred million

4858.469 --> 4868.4
kilometres would be around 1/10 of what

4864.32 --> 4870.53
it is close to the surface and if you go

4868.4 --> 4873.409
up another two hundred million

4870.53 --> 4876.07
kilometers you'd probably find the same

4873.409 --> 4876.07
pressure there

4877.75 --> 4881.469
so it doesn't change after 100 million

4879.82 --> 4884.61
columnist example now I'm not saying

4881.469 --> 4889.02
that look after a billion kilometres

4884.61 --> 4893.11
maybe that pressure will be

4889.02 --> 4894.13
three-quarters of that and where are the

4893.11 --> 4897.87
stars in all of this

4894.13 --> 4901.21
oh they're completely out of sight

4897.87 --> 4904.54
because you can only see them up to what

4901.21 --> 4907.21
is it 30 kilometers or something from

4904.54 --> 4908.86
what I've seen there's no sign that

4907.21 --> 4910.75
after a certain distance you will be

4908.86 --> 4912.849999999999
able to see any heavenly bodies it would

4910.75 --> 4922.27
be lucky to see the earth lit up beneath

4912.85 --> 4925.9890000000005
you and have you here he got evidence of

4922.27 --> 4928.360000000001
this physical evidence but measurement

4925.989 --> 4931.54
sensation are you able to do no this is

4928.36 --> 4933.3099999999995
all conceptualization because oh ah yeah

4931.54 --> 4935.199
because you haven't been up there I

4933.31 --> 4938.05
haven't been up there this is a

4935.199 --> 4941.41
conceptualization based on laws of

4938.05 --> 4944.320000000001
physics of how things could work that's

4941.41 --> 4947.65
called conceptualization it's not just

4944.32 --> 4949.179999999999
so story this is technical possibility

4947.65 --> 4952.179999999999
this is how it's gonna work

4949.18 --> 4956.41
we made estimations it's rough finger

4952.18 --> 4959.08
work but I abide by the logic of reality

4956.41 --> 4962.65
of how it could work and there's

4959.08 --> 4964.57
different circumstances so yeah it's not

4962.65 --> 4967.0599999999995
scientific proof I'm not claiming that

4964.57 --> 4970.449
I'm just saying this is how it could be

4967.06 --> 4972.76
possible this is what I estimate one

4970.449 --> 4977.04
could find there if you would physically

4972.76 --> 4980.650000000001
test it that is the likelihood that

4977.04 --> 4985.09
you're gonna find that and not but how

4980.65 --> 4988.03
it is in satellites what worried what

4985.09 --> 4990.6
are you going to take with you to

4988.03 --> 4992.86
someone who could possibly measure it

4990.6 --> 4997.09
you have to say look I've got this

4992.86 --> 4999.73
theory here are my calculations salt is

4997.09 --> 5003.96
here's my evidence that this could be

4999.73 --> 5005.129999999999
real can we confirm that we what are you

5003.96 --> 5009.099
going to take what evidence are you

5005.13 --> 5012.599
gonna take the only evidence

5009.099 --> 5015.07
we would take is one where I my eyes

5012.599 --> 5018.609
physically have been personally part of

5015.07 --> 5021.938999999999
the test or you probably won't get the

5018.609 --> 5026.649
presence of dilatory well I'm not gonna

5021.939 --> 5030.849
blindly trust anyone else ever to as a

5026.649 --> 5034.119000000001
foundation of proof I will confirm it

5030.849 --> 5036.879
myself I will not let anybody else go up

5034.119 --> 5040.058999999999
there without me to do it for me and

5036.879 --> 5042.82
then what you players us that's then it

5040.059 --> 5049.659000000001
could just as well hire NASA what's your

5042.82 --> 5055.179
plan for confirming this well the

5049.659 --> 5058.148999999999
Aeronautics just have to make plans to

5055.179 --> 5060.189
get up there whatever get it plane I

5058.149 --> 5062.579000000001
don't know I haven't really even thought

5060.189 --> 5066.099
about it it's it's gonna be more than

5062.579 --> 5067.929
just land travel okay because and you

5066.099 --> 5070.389
have to have permission I don't know I I

5067.929 --> 5073.809
personally don't have plans to be like

5070.389 --> 5075.82
the the sky explorer person like yeah

5073.809 --> 5077.379
I'm gonna explore what's up there if

5075.82 --> 5081.188999999999
there's a space it you'll know it

5077.379 --> 5082.479
hello I'm not a millionaire okay well

5081.189 --> 5084.789000000001
that's the next step you guys have to

5082.479 --> 5086.889
tell you coming - oh yeah we go abroad

5084.789 --> 5089.438999999999
you bring us the money and we'll do it

5086.889 --> 5092.8
if you think you've got the evidence you

5089.439 --> 5097.119000000001
have to present that so you did I what

5092.8 --> 5099.099
did I say well if you think you bought a

5097.119 --> 5101.079
concept you have to put together some

5099.099 --> 5104.349
evidence to support your con I deal with

5101.079 --> 5108.999
it I do have to so I can't just use the

5104.349 --> 5111.039
laws of physics and that oh you test

5108.999 --> 5113.349
whether your interpretation of those

5111.039 --> 5119.879
laws are right on you know it would be

5113.349 --> 5124.03
lovely to test it but the money would

5119.879 --> 5127.079
and you we can go buy what we can

5124.03 --> 5127.079
measure already

5127.98 --> 5133.15
yeah you can look what when it's

5131.889 --> 5135.3
something is out of your reach you can

5133.15 --> 5138.848999999999
imagine whatever you like you can

5135.3 --> 5141.849
imagine flying magical unicorns out

5138.849 --> 5145.659000000001
there out of sight doing all kind so you

5141.849 --> 5147.78
can mess you're brought into physical

5145.659 --> 5152.138999999999
things here on earth that you can test

5147.78 --> 5155.17
yeah doesn't doesn't mean anything so

5152.139 --> 5158.289
you can make up all these scientifically

5155.17 --> 5160.119
laws of physics contradicting concepts

5158.289 --> 5165.42
of what is out there out of your reach

5160.119 --> 5168.73
and then say yeah this is better and

5165.42 --> 5171.519
then the man for me when I actually base

5168.73 --> 5174.459999999999
my conceptualizations on known provable

5171.519 --> 5177.539000000001
things here on earth that I need that

5174.46 --> 5180.88
proof no it's ridiculous

5177.539 --> 5183.429
I'm conceptualizing just as much as the

5180.88 --> 5185.769
heliocentric conceptualization with just

5183.429 --> 5188.579
as much proof with one difference that

5185.769 --> 5192.76
my things make sense and are based on

5188.579 --> 5196.65
yeah repeatable things concepts here

5192.76 --> 5204.0
that we can kind of test and confirm

5196.65 --> 5204.0
person what and you're not doing it

5204.06 --> 5208.330000000001
more pointing at NASA just that's the

5207.85 --> 5210.51
priesthood

5208.33 --> 5210.51
Oh

5213.699 --> 5219.449
I mean what I'm getting at is if you've

5216.46 --> 5222.429
got all these concepts and ideas

5219.449 --> 5224.08
eventually you're gonna have to put them

5222.429 --> 5229.42
down on paper some some way or another

5224.08 --> 5232.42
and you don't need to well then in my

5229.42 --> 5232.9490000000005
head so that's the end of that no it's

5232.42 --> 5235.6900000000005
not

5232.949 --> 5241.509999999999
why should I write about it and you can

5235.69 --> 5243.549999999999
just talk about it look and I got many

5241.51 --> 5246.429
concepts even the rectangular looping

5243.55 --> 5248.26
world concept is something that could

5246.429 --> 5251.65
technically be proven I'd love to do it

5248.26 --> 5254.5
it's much closer in reach for me than to

5251.65 --> 5257.17
prove what's up there okay because

5254.5 --> 5259.12
traveling yeah you don't have to have

5257.17 --> 5260.83
some special craft for that or anything

5259.12 --> 5262.63
you just have to have a passport and

5260.83 --> 5266.5599999999995
enough money to go around and know where

5262.63 --> 5269.02
you're going that's it so yeah of course

5266.56 --> 5272.469
I want to prove my concepts or try to

5269.02 --> 5277.09
prove them and I planted like they just

5272.469 --> 5279.79
like the next day who are you to tell me

5277.09 --> 5283.6
that what I need to do with my concept

5279.79 --> 5286.21
to be convincing Oh to you well no I

5283.6 --> 5289.4490000000005
don't give a [ __ ] I will do everything

5286.21 --> 5298.69
in time sauce even though I don't give a

5289.449 --> 5304.719
rat's ass no a lot lot he what he wants

5298.69 --> 5308.199
me to say hello I don't need to do

5304.719 --> 5310.39
anything for anyone else I will do

5308.199 --> 5313.449
things when the time is there and when

5310.39 --> 5317.1
the options are there okay

5313.449 --> 5317.099999999999
I'm not in a hurry to do it

5318.97 --> 5325.09
like if I had the actual resources

5323.02 --> 5328.120000000001
available yeah I probably be a little

5325.09 --> 5330.43
bit more in a hurry to do it but until

5328.12 --> 5332.71
that time yeah I will just keep on doing

5330.43 --> 5337.150000000001
what I do and just terrorize and

5332.71 --> 5338.02
conceptualize yeah you can tell me prove

5337.15 --> 5340.719999999999
it prove it

5338.02 --> 5342.64
yeah well it's very nice I can't right

5340.72 --> 5344.68
now I don't have the resource so unless

5342.64 --> 5349.6
you're gonna hand me a freaking big huge

5344.68 --> 5351.85
bag of money then yeah you can't demand

5349.6 --> 5356.820000000001
that I do this when it's not within my

5351.85 --> 5356.820000000001
range of possibilities for me that's all

5359.94 --> 5374.669999999999
whoa I've been going very long yeah you

5369.76 --> 5376.900000000001
started at all didn't you I started

5374.67 --> 5380.95
almost one and a half hour ago

5376.9 --> 5386.259999999999
Oh 12 years midnight for me right that

5380.95 --> 5388.33
was when you started anyway let's see

5386.26 --> 5395.320000000001
yeah they were great to disagree I think

5388.33 --> 5398.01
I know until you can I'm just your

5395.32 --> 5400.42
average Joe right and if you can

5398.01 --> 5404.1
convince if you can convince the people

5400.42 --> 5407.53
that are above average compared to me

5404.1 --> 5410.200000000001
I'll listen I'll probably stick my head

5407.53 --> 5412.83
up and have a bit more to look at it but

5410.2 --> 5418.51
at this stage I don't see it being a

5412.83 --> 5419.62
working situation concept well I don't

5418.51 --> 5428.71
see why not

5419.62 --> 5430.93
I haven't any problems yet I don't know

5428.71 --> 5433.4800000000005
I think my rectangular loop being model

5430.93 --> 5437.92
and it really is a model even though I

5433.48 --> 5441.879999999999
haven't I don't have like a 3d render

5437.92 --> 5443.74
Abul system for it like that but just a

5441.88 --> 5445.68
conceptualization of how it's supposed

5443.74 --> 5448.84
to fit together and the physics of it

5445.68 --> 5450.88
yeah your body's probably eat your

5448.84 --> 5452.84
muscles your model is probably the

5450.88 --> 5454.61
easiest to conceptualize

5452.84 --> 5459.05
outside of the globe except for a couple

5454.61 --> 5461.839999999999
things like what where the Sun and

5459.05 --> 5462.650000000001
pedestal and move moon moves from one

5461.84 --> 5470.54
side to the other

5462.65 --> 5472.909
no first our cabins look how many times

5470.54 --> 5475.369
do I have to explain globe of the

5472.909 --> 5478.699
heavens is always at the edge of vision

5475.369 --> 5482.03
for every single observer that is the

5478.699 --> 5484.3099999999995
rule that is what happens every single

5482.03 --> 5487.04
time never gets closer never gets

5484.31 --> 5489.26
farther away it's at the edge of vision

5487.04 --> 5493.58
on that globe of the on the edge of

5489.26 --> 5495.860000000001
vision that's where it is always and the

5493.58 --> 5499.489
Sun on that globe always follows the

5495.86 --> 5506.32
same path and it seems to pretty much go

5499.489 --> 5509.419999999999
from east to west in that loop line so

5506.32 --> 5511.5199999999995
technically now if you would imagine the

5509.42 --> 5517.4800000000005
Sun to be in a physical neutral position

5511.52 --> 5520.909000000001
it's gonna move over the east-west line

5517.48 --> 5523.25
yeah if you look at the picture in the

5520.909 --> 5524.8099999999995
Hangout they come back over east of West

5523.25 --> 5527.96
but it's not in a physical literal

5524.81 --> 5531.679
position it's only the relative position

5527.96 --> 5537.9800000000005
to the observer where it appears and all

5531.679 --> 5541.79
the daylight so that's because it's

5537.98 --> 5544.159
holographic it's I don't know you have

5541.79 --> 5547.79
to get that first you have to really get

5544.159 --> 5550.699
what that means and once you truly get

5547.79 --> 5553.58
that then it's really not that hard it's

5550.699 --> 5555.268999999999
really not that hard to to figure out

5553.58 --> 5559.53
what's happening

5555.269 --> 5563.999
in the world with this solid this solid

5559.53 --> 5570.659
measurable thing is up in space no okay

5563.999 --> 5573.21
it's all spectrums Spectre griffey right

5570.659 --> 5575.19
yeah spectrography where they're

5573.21 --> 5577.409
basically interpreting light as a

5575.19 --> 5579.388999999999
physical matter without actually

5577.409 --> 5582.289
confirming that it is physical matter it

5579.389 --> 5586.139
is affirming the consequent reasoning

5582.289 --> 5588.119
it's very abusable just because you can

5586.139 --> 5589.53
prove that when you shine light of

5588.119 --> 5591.53
certain materials that the light

5589.53 --> 5593.88
reflected will have certain properties

5591.53 --> 5596.82
doesn't mean that if you find those

5593.88 --> 5598.650000000001
light properties in a light source that

5596.82 --> 5601.17
you're measuring that it must be that

5598.65 --> 5605.249
material that's an affirming the

5601.17 --> 5607.559
consequent unless you physically confirm

5605.249 --> 5608.94
that material to be there it is an

5607.559 --> 5612.42
affirming the consequent it is a

5608.94 --> 5614.699
presupposition that the light from that

5612.42 --> 5616.559
source must be coming from that material

5614.699 --> 5618.48
because when you shine a light on that

5616.559 --> 5623.369000000001
material that is the light that comes

5618.48 --> 5625.11
from it on earth so proof it's no

5623.369 --> 5628.17
physical you have to confirm the

5625.11 --> 5631.23
physical nature first and only when you

5628.17 --> 5635.639
do that that that then you can finally

5631.23 --> 5639.119
make the claim that spectroscopy could

5635.639 --> 5642.09
prove the material yeah the the type of

5639.119 --> 5644.07
material that is part of it you have to

5642.09 --> 5647.360000000001
confirm its physicality first otherwise

5644.07 --> 5647.36
you're just going to be speculating

5650.239 --> 5656.239
and you don't think we've done that with

5652.31 --> 5659.39
the moon absolutely you have not done

5656.239 --> 5661.759999999999
that with me ridiculous even the light

5659.39 --> 5664.79
that comes from it is obviously cold and

5661.76 --> 5668.27
this is being completely erased and

5664.79 --> 5673.76
ignored and ridiculed and totally walked

5668.27 --> 5677.780000000001
away from in in the regular heliocentric

5673.76 --> 5681.7390000000005
sciences can explain the freaking moon

5677.78 --> 5683.75
light being cold from it being reflected

5681.739 --> 5689.629999999999
doesn't make any sense a reflected light

5683.75 --> 5693.26
can only have a spectrum of the light

5689.63 --> 5695.36
originally being sent so a warm light

5693.26 --> 5697.1
could never turn in a cold light by

5695.36 --> 5699.339999999999
being reflected that doesn't make any

5697.1 --> 5699.34
damn sense

5699.79 --> 5705.53
whatever is reflected can only reflect

5702.52 --> 5709.4800000000005
the spectrum of the light that is

5705.53 --> 5711.8
hitting that reflector so it can never

5709.48 --> 5713.54
transform it into a completely different

5711.8 --> 5718.18
light spectrum that doesn't work that

5713.54 --> 5719.469
way that's not how reflections work so

5718.18 --> 5723.159000000001
now

5719.469 --> 5725.62
spectroscopy and the moon

5723.159 --> 5727.469
I don't even think they did that I think

5725.62 --> 5730.2699999999995
that the moon landings pretty much

5727.469 --> 5731.86
replaced the entire necessity of

5730.27 --> 5733.929
approaching it that way ingesting oh

5731.86 --> 5737.799999999999
look astronauts walk there in the sand

5733.929 --> 5741.88
we got a petrified woods moon rock and

5737.8 --> 5743.92
some dust some sand and yeah that is the

5741.88 --> 5746.9490000000005
proof of the material nature of the Moon

5743.92 --> 5749.7390000000005
and what it's supposedly consisted of so

5746.949 --> 5751.509999999999
they're not gonna use spectroscopy to

5749.739 --> 5753.549999999999
see what kind of material the moon

5751.51 --> 5755.29
supposedly is made of because of the

5753.55 --> 5757.96
spectrum of the light that's coming from

5755.29 --> 5761.44
it I bet you get some really weird
