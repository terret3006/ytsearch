[Music]

85.34 --> 89.96000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

88.74 --> 93.29899999999999
bird number

89.96 --> 94.979
1187 I'm your host Arwin and before we

93.299 --> 97.259
start the show please don't forget to

94.979 --> 98.939
share it on any platform you deem fit

97.259 --> 100.74
and if you haven't already please

98.939 --> 102.83999999999999
subscribe to my channel and hit the Bell

100.74 --> 105.41999999999999
notification so you know when I'm going

102.84 --> 107.52000000000001
live which is normally 1pm Amsterdam

105.42 --> 109.799
time in the weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam

107.52 --> 112.079
time in the weekend and please also do

109.799 --> 114.299
support me through the PayPal patreon

112.079 --> 117.29899999999999
Super Chat and the membership system

114.299 --> 122.64
join button there will be much

117.299 --> 124.2
appreciated and like yeah direly needed

122.64 --> 127.57900000000001
because

124.2 --> 127.57900000000001
yeah I'm broke

128.099 --> 134.16
so

130.14 --> 137.33999999999997
I was kind of well disappointed not

134.16 --> 139.79999999999998
getting any support yesterday I it must

137.34 --> 142.56
have been a fluke or something but

139.8 --> 144.78
that's really problematic for me

142.56 --> 145.92000000000002
so I really hope to get some support

144.78 --> 149.459
today

145.92 --> 152.45899999999997
anyway the weather today is

149.459 --> 154.739
remarkably similar to yesterday

152.459 --> 156.36
again it started out kind of hazy and

154.739 --> 160.14000000000001
cloudy

156.36 --> 163.5
but then it kind of moved over like a

160.14 --> 167.45899999999997
big wall just like yesterday

163.5 --> 172.64
you can see it's even the same place

167.459 --> 172.64000000000001
and up here it's beautiful blue clear

172.739 --> 177.659
also I noticed surprisingly that the

175.62 --> 179.159
window has seems to have a lot of dust

177.659 --> 181.5
on it so

179.159 --> 184.14
I think Somewhere in the Night

181.5 --> 186.54
might have rained a little

184.14 --> 190.33999999999997
but I wouldn't have noticed but there's

186.54 --> 190.34
a lot of dust in the air so

191.099 --> 195.56
it's like yeah I just cleaned these

192.78 --> 195.56
windows but now

197.28 --> 201.5
so

199.019 --> 205.4
this orangey

201.5 --> 205.4
dust is all over it again

206.76 --> 210.29899999999998
but yeah that I think that's pretty

208.739 --> 213.299
normal

210.299 --> 215.519
I think that may actually be like desert

213.299 --> 217.739
sand dust

215.519 --> 220.44
because I remember like even in the 90s

217.739 --> 223.379
that that would like suddenly dust

220.44 --> 225.959
clouds would come flying over

223.379 --> 229.319
and everything would look like

225.959 --> 231.599
was just some Desert Storm just flew

229.319 --> 233.39999999999998
over or something so

231.599 --> 235.5
yeah that seemed to have happened this

233.4 --> 236.78
night

235.5 --> 241.28
anyway

236.78 --> 241.28
Kevlar first in chat Matthew Hall

241.56 --> 247.62
it is Thursday the 17th of March 2022

251.22 --> 255.599
and yeah I'm a bit

253.98 --> 257.59999999999997
a bit tired

255.599 --> 260.299
feel a little drained those

257.6 --> 264.079
yesterday's flatters debate was

260.299 --> 264.07899999999995
insane Lee long

264.96 --> 271.79999999999995
like another Nathan one of Nathan's

268.8 --> 274.199
crazy goes but yeah because there again

271.8 --> 276.66
were a lot of anti-flat earthers that

274.199 --> 278.28000000000003
got in Google fires got in there another

276.66 --> 281.84000000000003
guy got in there

278.28 --> 281.84
the kuma was just

282.24 --> 285.66
just do

286.02 --> 291.68
like at some point it literally sounded

288.479 --> 291.68
like he was like

291.78 --> 296.58
and you say

293.34 --> 298.85999999999996
like psychotic like actually psychotic

296.58 --> 302.21999999999997
where he would just literally not even

298.86 --> 305.759
understand how to talk anymore it went

302.22 --> 309.66
he went really nutty and Nathan was like

305.759 --> 313.199
brutal brutally strict on point and he

309.66 --> 317.22
just we could barely as a panel get good

313.199 --> 319.74
we could barely get a word in between

317.22 --> 322.139
and it just went on and on

319.74 --> 323.88
laughs

322.139 --> 325.259
but yeah that should make a an

323.88 --> 328.259
interesting

325.259 --> 330.91900000000004
after show

328.259 --> 330.91900000000004
right

331.68 --> 338.539
yeah also it inspired me for the title

334.259 --> 338.539
for today's show dingleberry dependency

341.52 --> 344.24
ah

344.28 --> 347.78
anyway how are you guys doing

348.84 --> 352.58
fully infected fires no

353.34 --> 357.5
nothing infected it's just that

359.699 --> 366.539
akumu got cornered

363.0 --> 369.74
and he just would not

366.539 --> 369.74
he wouldn't give up

370.44 --> 375.06
like he wouldn't even back down he was

372.539 --> 377.039
just like no just keep humiliating he

375.06 --> 379.319
was literally trying to tire Nathan out

377.039 --> 381.539
but Nathan wasn't tiring out

379.319 --> 383.28000000000003
So eventually like Akuma just got like a

381.539 --> 385.52
headache but he just still wouldn't back

383.28 --> 385.52
out

388.86 --> 392.36
it was a little crazy

394.139 --> 400.1
yeah anyway

397.44 --> 400.1
uh

406.199 --> 410.759
yeah

408.419 --> 415.52
yesterday's show here

410.759 --> 415.52000000000004
it was okay but God let's just

415.86 --> 421.199
I was a little agitated and there were

419.039 --> 424.199
people in my chat

421.199 --> 424.199
agitating

424.56 --> 430.979
like and get it is just the same the

427.86 --> 434.72
gadget inspector is not getting back in

430.979 --> 437.75899999999996
here because he has absolutely

434.72 --> 439.44000000000005
no self-control

437.759 --> 441.41900000000004
and it's over

439.44 --> 442.62
I don't want to tolerate like he doesn't

441.419 --> 445.25899999999996
even have

442.62 --> 447.66
full self-control on good days and I'm

445.259 --> 450.3
done with it

447.66 --> 452.34000000000003
like he has doesn't seem to have any

450.3 --> 454.68
sort of self-awareness

452.34 --> 457.19899999999996
in the moment

454.68 --> 459.62
concerning his own attitude and I'm done

457.199 --> 459.62
with that

464.639 --> 469.039
and yeah Lydia logs I don't know

471.539 --> 475.87899999999996
Lydia logs kind of been wasting our time

477.24 --> 480.78000000000003
I mean I've had worse in my chat but

479.4 --> 483.19899999999996
it's just

480.78 --> 483.19899999999996
uh

483.539 --> 488.9
not feeling the best

486.06 --> 488.9
dude

489.12 --> 492.3
Matthew Hall that's

491.699 --> 494.3
that's

492.3 --> 494.3
ouch

495.419 --> 499.15999999999997
you got a lot of Sorrows last night

502.919 --> 506.4
um

504.539 --> 509.18
all right well make sure you drink

506.4 --> 509.17999999999995
plenty of water

513.659 --> 519.06
yeah yeah livers do regenerate but don't

517.019 --> 522.899
push it too much

519.06 --> 525.899
God got the whole bottle cool

522.899 --> 528.6
dude that's

525.899 --> 529.519
just thinking about that makes my liver

528.6 --> 532.8000000000001
hurt

529.519 --> 534.9590000000001
and everything else yeah

532.8 --> 537.18
because remember those times that I got

534.959 --> 538.8
really sick from like

537.18 --> 541.9799999999999
absent

538.8 --> 544.4399999999999
oh that's basically from a tiny little

541.98 --> 548.88
bottom so the idea of literally an

544.44 --> 551.7790000000001
entire ball of whiskey just it scares me

548.88 --> 554.519
I'd probably die

551.779 --> 557.16
but I think Matthew is probably a bit

554.519 --> 559.5
bigger guy

557.16 --> 562.14
certainly hope so for him if you're

559.5 --> 564.74
gonna chug up an entire bottle

562.14 --> 564.74
but

564.899 --> 571.44
just make sure you drink enough water

567.779 --> 574.68
get some extra vitamin C

571.44 --> 578.519
and yeah plenty of sleep

574.68 --> 581.959
or well like in between sleep just I I

578.519 --> 581.9590000000001
don't know you you know what to do

587.82 --> 591.62
yeah take care man Matthew Hall

594.12 --> 597.12
foreign

597.959 --> 603.8389999999999
yeah

600.66 --> 606.24
it's weird I'm a little down myself

603.839 --> 607.9200000000001
but that's more because of finances and

606.24 --> 610.98
I'm just like

607.92 --> 614.66
I want to get angry at you guys but

610.98 --> 614.66
you guys are doing your best

616.079 --> 619.62
it's just not not it's not fun being

618.66 --> 624.18
broke

619.62 --> 626.579
and then whiny people start start to try

624.18 --> 629.459
and bully you with that too like Gadget

626.579 --> 631.62
inspector who was doing that in fvd chat

629.459 --> 633.3599999999999
and they banned him there too yeah I got

631.62 --> 635.82
a wrench there

633.36 --> 638.48
so

635.82 --> 638.48
uh

643.019 --> 647.12
right Matthew I'll take it easy

652.079 --> 657.92
had a long phone call with my friend the

654.899 --> 657.92
name Ethan by the way

660.18 --> 663.079
pretty intense

682.32 --> 685.6400000000001
dude where is everybody

699.48 --> 703.74
by the way I have noticed and apparently

701.7 --> 705.6600000000001
Nathan too that

703.74 --> 708.24
well the amount of subscribers I've been

705.66 --> 709.019
getting has been slightly yeah growing

708.24 --> 711.42
again

709.019 --> 714.42
for a while

711.42 --> 716.6999999999999
just surprising because it's been pretty

714.42 --> 718.88
much at the same spot for like half a

716.7 --> 718.88
year

718.92 --> 723.66
guests like every freaking year that

721.38 --> 725.639
happens it's just like they put the

723.66 --> 727.92
brake on it and it's like no you're just

725.639 --> 729.42
going to have exactly the same amount of

727.92 --> 731.639
subscribers

729.42 --> 734.6999999999999
for six months straight

731.639 --> 738.36
even though it does says oh oh you got

734.7 --> 742.38
29 subscribers in the last 30 days 28

738.36 --> 746.1
days yeah but literally the same amount

742.38 --> 748.86
for for six months and now certainly

746.1 --> 750.5400000000001
it's like oh now I actually got 30 more

748.86 --> 754.339
subscribers

750.54 --> 754.3389999999999
in the last two weeks

755.399 --> 760.44
just doesn't really make a lot of sense

757.86 --> 762.42
to me but I've noticed a lot of new

760.44 --> 763.6800000000001
people getting in the chat too and

762.42 --> 767.06
that's nice

763.68 --> 767.06
I really appreciate that

768.42 --> 773.54
hello Robert digital rest Dad good to

771.3 --> 773.54
see you

783.06 --> 786.1999999999999
oh man

803.94 --> 809.24
yeah by the way did anybody hear my joke

806.94 --> 809.24
yet

809.579 --> 814.8
the the in relation to the coriola

812.22 --> 816.48
situation it was supposed earth-based

814.8 --> 818.54
coriolis

816.48 --> 822.36
how the

818.54 --> 824.9399999999999
anti-flat artists tell us oh it's uh

822.36 --> 827.54
there's no coriolis deviation because of

824.94 --> 827.5400000000001
uh

828.42 --> 831.9799999999999
damn it I lost the word

832.139 --> 837.24
conservation of momentum right

834.959 --> 839.66
conservation of angular momentum or

837.24 --> 843.48
linear momentum or I made up

839.66 --> 845.459
conservation of stationary momentum

843.48 --> 847.8000000000001
Nathan thought that was very annoying

845.459 --> 849.7199999999999
because it's such a double speak thing

847.8 --> 851.9399999999999
yeah yeah it is but it's kind of funny

849.72 --> 854.519
how it works out isn't it when you start

851.94 --> 857.0400000000001
to technically Analyze That

854.519 --> 859.62
it is kind of what the anti-flat artists

857.04 --> 862.62
are claiming conservation of stationary

859.62 --> 865.079
momentum like oh if you think of it as

862.62 --> 866.399
moving in lockstep then there's no

865.079 --> 869.8389999999999
movement

866.399 --> 869.839
or it's just stationary

871.5 --> 879.0
the conservation of stationary momentum

875.399 --> 882.0
trademark Arwin 2022

879.0 --> 882.0
whatever

882.06 --> 884.06
um

926.54 --> 930.779
coriola's effect is a disease of the

928.56 --> 933.18
mind no not really it's an apparent

930.779 --> 936.199
deviation

933.18 --> 936.199
with two

936.959 --> 943.4399999999999
separated reference frames right

940.92 --> 945.959
but it the thing is that Coriolis effect

943.44 --> 948.4200000000001
has all these consequences

945.959 --> 951.8599999999999
and it's the consequences that the globe

948.42 --> 951.86
earthers deny

952.98 --> 956.54
right they might theoretically State

954.72 --> 958.6990000000001
like oh yeah this and that should happen

956.54 --> 962.8199999999999
but it doesn't

958.699 --> 966.2589999999999
because of weird

962.82 --> 966.259
conjured reasons

968.339 --> 975.12
which don't actually work out

971.22 --> 977.4200000000001
it's more mathematical excuses than it's

975.12 --> 977.42
actually

978.779 --> 985.459
uh properly

981.06 --> 985.459
constructed arguments based in physics

992.04 --> 999.12
keep saying conservation of momentum is

994.86 --> 1001.779
not Earth moving under things

999.12 --> 1001.779
well

1001.94 --> 1005.839
the thing about conservation of momentum

1004.459 --> 1009.1389999999999
is

1005.839 --> 1012.74
it doesn't apply to gases

1009.139 --> 1014.899
you know why because gases don't have

1012.74 --> 1017.899
momentum

1014.899 --> 1019.519
yeah this is my personal analysis

1017.899 --> 1020.779
argument that I've been saying in a long

1019.519 --> 1023.12
time

1020.779 --> 1025.939
gases are not susceptible to momentum

1023.12 --> 1028.039
I've had show titles titled like that

1025.939 --> 1031.8190000000002
gases are not susceptible to momentum

1028.039 --> 1034.819
they only respond to local air pressure

1031.819 --> 1034.819
differential

1035.299 --> 1040.6399999999999
push against the air it builds up a

1038.24 --> 1042.079
little pressure it displaces to the

1040.64 --> 1043.2990000000002
Lesser pressure area directly

1042.079 --> 1047.299
surrounding it

1043.299 --> 1049.58
and then it just falls back into the

1047.299 --> 1052.76
average pressure

1049.58 --> 1054.74
it doesn't build up you can't throw gas

1052.76 --> 1058.46
and it will keep going that doesn't

1054.74 --> 1060.74
happen ever right that might sort of

1058.46 --> 1063.8600000000001
partially happen if it's in a balloon

1060.74 --> 1066.2
why because a balloon is a solid and

1063.86 --> 1068.8999999999999
that solid will have some momentum but

1066.2 --> 1071.3600000000001
the gas is in within it even will

1068.9 --> 1074.419
literally provably slow it down you know

1071.36 --> 1076.28
you can take a balloon and then be like

1074.419 --> 1077.3600000000001
Oh I'm gonna throw it and as you throw

1076.28 --> 1080.539
it

1077.36 --> 1082.8799999999999
your arm movement will be fast and then

1080.539 --> 1084.679
as soon as you let it go it doesn't go

1082.88 --> 1088.5800000000002
that fast anymore and it slows down

1084.679 --> 1090.799
quickly because of the gases inside

1088.58 --> 1093.1999999999998
that are basically pressure competing

1090.799 --> 1095.36
with the gases outside

1093.2 --> 1098.1200000000001
and they don't have momentum they will

1095.36 --> 1101.299
literally try that despite being caught

1098.12 --> 1103.1
up cut off by a barrier which is the

1101.299 --> 1105.3799999999999
balloon

1103.1 --> 1108.6789999999999
they will try to even out with the

1105.38 --> 1110.6000000000001
pressure surrounding them so gases

1108.679 --> 1113.66
don't

1110.6 --> 1115.28
have conservation of momentum they don't

1113.66 --> 1118.16
have mode they are not susceptible to

1115.28 --> 1120.799
momentum right so the entire argument

1118.16 --> 1123.26
conjured like oh it moves in locksteps

1120.799 --> 1125.84
conservation moment that's super cute

1123.26 --> 1127.78
the problem is it doesn't actually work

1125.84 --> 1130.1
with the gas

1127.78 --> 1132.98
oh yeah

1130.1 --> 1135.62
good luck with that right now of course

1132.98 --> 1138.6200000000001
if you think of the gases as being fluid

1135.62 --> 1141.9189999999999
and then ignore gas behavior and just

1138.62 --> 1145.2399999999998
think that okay all gases and liquids

1141.919 --> 1148.3400000000001
are liquids because they're all fluids

1145.24 --> 1150.2
and no more gas pressure expansion in

1148.34 --> 1154.039
all directions because it's a liquid

1150.2 --> 1157.3400000000001
because it's a fluid and yeah fluids or

1154.039 --> 1159.44
I mean liquids do have momentum right

1157.34 --> 1161.1789999999999
they do you throw

1159.44 --> 1162.8600000000001
a cup of water

1161.179 --> 1165.44
it's gonna

1162.86 --> 1167.8999999999999
take that force of the of the the

1165.44 --> 1169.64
lobbying and then

1167.9 --> 1171.8600000000001
stretch out

1169.64 --> 1174.6200000000001
because it does have momentum yeah

1171.86 --> 1176.62
problem is is that gases aren't actually

1174.62 --> 1178.2199999999998
liquids

1176.62 --> 1181.28
so

1178.22 --> 1183.32
yeah there is no momentum there is no

1181.28 --> 1185.48
momentum of gas in order for them to

1183.32 --> 1187.9399999999998
move in lockstep with the rotation of

1185.48 --> 1191.179
spinning ball Earth that just is

1187.94 --> 1194.8400000000001
physically impossible it's

1191.179 --> 1196.88
really an excuse probably based on the

1194.84 --> 1199.76
theory of relativity

1196.88 --> 1202.5800000000002
that suggests as just relative so it can

1199.76 --> 1205.22
seem stationary from one reference frame

1202.58 --> 1209.48
but in the wider picture it's all moving

1205.22 --> 1211.94
and that is just that's cute

1209.48 --> 1214.4
but yeah we're dealing with material

1211.94 --> 1217.5800000000002
here and gases are not susceptible to

1214.4 --> 1219.919
momentum so it just doesn't work it just

1217.58 --> 1221.8999999999999
doesn't work within physics and there's

1219.919 --> 1224.7800000000002
nothing they can do about it

1221.9 --> 1227.98
except hope that their listeners just

1224.78 --> 1227.98
don't catch on to this

1239.48 --> 1243.44
anyway hello classical homeopath Jeff

1241.82 --> 1247.12
gashead

1243.44 --> 1247.1200000000001
see you aries106

1249.26 --> 1257.74
ever seen a shock wave from a explosion

1253.28 --> 1257.74
yeah that's not momentum you idiot

1258.26 --> 1262.82
that's literally a shock wave it's a

1261.14 --> 1266.659
wave

1262.82 --> 1269.96
that's not the same gases at the center

1266.659 --> 1273.5590000000002
of the explosion reaching hundreds of

1269.96 --> 1277.28
miles away because those gases had

1273.559 --> 1278.539
momentum from the explosion no it's a

1277.28 --> 1281.8999999999999
ripple

1278.539 --> 1282.919
you understand like a sound wave that's

1281.9 --> 1285.3200000000002
literally

1282.919 --> 1288.26
you have the explosion

1285.32 --> 1290.24
what's going outside or here what what

1288.26 --> 1293.6
you see there what's the shock wave

1290.24 --> 1296.059
there that's not the same gas as over

1293.6 --> 1299.36
here yeah

1296.059 --> 1301.76
just like if you have a a bucket of

1299.36 --> 1303.9189999999999
water and you drop a rock in it or

1301.76 --> 1307.76
something bigger the bathtub filled with

1303.919 --> 1311.2990000000002
water yeah that Ripple that's all

1307.76 --> 1315.44
separate parts of water that Ripple is

1311.299 --> 1317.179
not a singular thing that has a momentum

1315.44 --> 1320.8400000000001
you see

1317.179 --> 1323.299
it's different parts of water every

1320.84 --> 1327.02
single step of the way because it's a

1323.299 --> 1330.44
ripple it's a wave it's not a droplet

1327.02 --> 1332.6
that has a momentum and that literally

1330.44 --> 1334.94
that same droplet moves all the way over

1332.6 --> 1338.8999999999999
there that's not what an explosion is

1334.94 --> 1341.0
that's not what dropping a rock in water

1338.9 --> 1345.0800000000002
does it's not the same thing that's

1341.0 --> 1348.08
creating a wave that's not a piece of

1345.08 --> 1352.6999999999998
material having momentum

1348.08 --> 1354.86
it's not the same Aries 106.

1352.7 --> 1359.8400000000001
yeah

1354.86 --> 1362.539
it's a shock wave it's a wave wave

1359.84 --> 1365.559
not an object or a piece of material

1362.539 --> 1365.559
with momentum

1365.659 --> 1369.3200000000002
right except if they're like in that

1367.76 --> 1370.64
explosion

1369.32 --> 1373.34
yeah

1370.64 --> 1375.94
I don't know debris you know solid

1373.34 --> 1378.86
debris yeah that may go all the way

1375.94 --> 1381.919
somewhere else you know

1378.86 --> 1385.52
because it's solid but that actual that

1381.919 --> 1388.8200000000002
wave and the sound wave you hear it boom

1385.52 --> 1391.6399999999999
yeah that's not the same piece of gas at

1388.82 --> 1394.039
the center of explosion traveling all

1391.64 --> 1396.919
the way to you to reach you no because

1394.039 --> 1399.08
it's a wave

1396.919 --> 1401.419
it's different parts every step of the

1399.08 --> 1404.12
way that's not momentum

1401.419 --> 1406.7
it's a wave

1404.12 --> 1409.2199999999998
seems to have but it doesn't because

1406.7 --> 1410.48
it's a wave

1409.22 --> 1413.3600000000001
yeah

1410.48 --> 1416.9
I mean there's forces there

1413.36 --> 1419.4399999999998
there's the pressure differential will

1416.9 --> 1423.5
perpetuate yeah the shock wave

1419.44 --> 1424.5800000000002
but it's not the same material that is

1423.5 --> 1427.58
being

1424.58 --> 1427.58
displaced

1427.82 --> 1430.46
it's

1429.02 --> 1432.8799999999999
Bang

1430.46 --> 1432.88
Bang

1433.1 --> 1438.3999999999999
all different separate pieces of

1436.1 --> 1442.4599999999998
material all slapping into one another

1438.4 --> 1445.76
moving on that's what that is not one

1442.46 --> 1447.8600000000001
thing that goes all the way to to the

1445.76 --> 1450.52
outside miles and miles away that's not

1447.86 --> 1450.52
what that is

1455.0 --> 1458.38
smoke circles

1458.9 --> 1465.02
smoke circles but smoke is that yeah

1462.2 --> 1468.5
smoke is not a gas

1465.02 --> 1471.679
smoke are solid particles

1468.5 --> 1474.38
and they don't really have momentum they

1471.679 --> 1478.8400000000001
kind of drift

1474.38 --> 1478.8400000000001
yeah because they're just

1479.48 --> 1484.179
yeah they don't really have effective

1481.94 --> 1484.179
weight

1484.4 --> 1489.6200000000001
so they just drift

1486.38 --> 1493.0390000000002
they don't really have momentum

1489.62 --> 1496.8999999999999
you can't throw smoke

1493.039 --> 1496.9
just like you can throw gas

1501.2 --> 1505.299
any motion has momentum

1505.7 --> 1510.14
yeah the force perhaps yeah the force

1508.159 --> 1511.279
will have momentum the force will carry

1510.14 --> 1514.64
on

1511.279 --> 1518.02
but it's not like a conservation of

1514.64 --> 1518.0200000000002
momentum scenario

1519.5 --> 1524.96
yeah

1521.9 --> 1528.38
it's one thing slapping into something

1524.96 --> 1531.98
else that slap then carries on to the

1528.38 --> 1535.7600000000002
next something else that's what that is

1531.98 --> 1539.72
that's not the same thing

1535.76 --> 1541.4
traveling all the way which is what the

1539.72 --> 1544.7
conservation of momentum of supposed

1541.4 --> 1547.159
spinning ball Earth suggests

1544.7 --> 1548.6000000000001
that's the entire suggestion that's what

1547.159 --> 1549.98
we're talking about that's why I

1548.6 --> 1552.559
explained it

1549.98 --> 1555.799
yeah that can't work gas doesn't have

1552.559 --> 1558.44
momentum sure it can be subjected to

1555.799 --> 1561.44
shock waves ripples

1558.44 --> 1564.0800000000002
right but that's not going to give it

1561.44 --> 1567.2
momentum the same piece of gas isn't

1564.08 --> 1568.58
going to travel all that way because it

1567.2 --> 1571.7
had Force

1568.58 --> 1575.1789999999999
subjected to it no it's literally gonna

1571.7 --> 1577.94
give off its Force to the gas right next

1575.179 --> 1580.64
to it which will absorb it and then give

1577.94 --> 1583.159
off its Force right next to the next

1580.64 --> 1586.4
layer gas right next to it

1583.159 --> 1589.0390000000002
etc etc it's not the same piece of gas

1586.4 --> 1591.919
that's traveling all that way because

1589.039 --> 1595.24
gas doesn't have momentum

1591.919 --> 1595.24
doesn't work that way

1606.5 --> 1611.0
when Wind Blows isn't that air particles

1608.779 --> 1612.26
moving yeah but not because of momentum

1611.0 --> 1614.6
it's because of air pressure

1612.26 --> 1617.779
differential I explained that

1614.6 --> 1618.6789999999999
yeah gas moves around because the

1617.779 --> 1620.179
pressure

1618.679 --> 1625.159
of it

1620.179 --> 1626.96
is slightly less next to it and then it

1625.159 --> 1630.44
all starts to move

1626.96 --> 1633.08
to equalize the pressure differential

1630.44 --> 1635.539
that's not momentum

1633.08 --> 1638.24
that's gas pressure Dynamics

1635.539 --> 1641.14
it's very different it's not a solid or

1638.24 --> 1641.14
a liquid object

1649.94 --> 1656.3200000000002
the gas won't stop it's not momentum

1652.039 --> 1656.32
it's that's gas pressure expansion

1656.6 --> 1661.1789999999999
gas pressure expansion is different from

1659.659 --> 1664.159
Force

1661.179 --> 1667.22
conception momentum

1664.159 --> 1669.3200000000002
yeah you add a force to something it

1667.22 --> 1671.3600000000001
keeps moving

1669.32 --> 1673.76
with the same amount of force that's

1671.36 --> 1675.5
conservation and momentum gas doesn't do

1673.76 --> 1678.44
that

1675.5 --> 1680.96
it doesn't travel if you give it

1678.44 --> 1683.3600000000001
momentum if you insert a force it

1680.96 --> 1684.679
doesn't start to travel with that force

1683.36 --> 1688.6999999999998
it doesn't

1684.679 --> 1691.3400000000001
transverse a distance it just exerts its

1688.7 --> 1692.8400000000001
local air pressure differential to the

1691.34 --> 1695.36
surrounding which will immediately

1692.84 --> 1697.9399999999998
absorb it and after it's been absorbed

1695.36 --> 1700.52
the original piece of gas

1697.94 --> 1702.799
will literally lose all its force and

1700.52 --> 1705.86
will stay right where it is

1702.799 --> 1709.1589999999999
because only thing it does is just

1705.86 --> 1712.1
give off its air pressure differential

1709.159 --> 1714.8600000000001
to the surrounding it doesn't travel

1712.1 --> 1717.82
because of momentum because it's gas and

1714.86 --> 1717.82
gas doesn't do that

1718.58 --> 1722.08
no it doesn't Rasta

1722.179 --> 1727.88
you know what I'm talking about

1725.179 --> 1732.799
no it doesn't

1727.88 --> 1735.7990000000002
gas doesn't have momentum if you throw

1732.799 --> 1739.6589999999999
gas it doesn't absorb that momentum and

1735.799 --> 1742.399
keep going it doesn't do that

1739.659 --> 1744.3200000000002
solids and liquids do that gases don't

1742.399 --> 1747.6789999999999
they only respond to air pressure

1744.32 --> 1752.6789999999999
differential locally and as soon as it's

1747.679 --> 1752.679
equalized they lose their motion

1753.74 --> 1758.96
no it doesn't rest that I'm timing you

1756.02 --> 1761.72
out I'm not in the mood for this [ __ ]

1758.96 --> 1763.46
I've been explaining this for a freaking

1761.72 --> 1765.98
year

1763.46 --> 1770.1200000000001
I know what the [ __ ] I'm talking about I

1765.98 --> 1772.3990000000001
don't care if you're in a nitpicky mood

1770.12 --> 1774.6399999999999
I'm not tolerating that [ __ ] from you

1772.399 --> 1774.6399999999999
today

1776.46 --> 1779.95
[Music]

1781.039 --> 1788.059
gas pressure doesn't have momentum it

1785.12 --> 1790.7199999999998
doesn't have momentum it doesn't have

1788.059 --> 1790.72
momentum

1792.44 --> 1796.059
you can't throw gas

1801.8 --> 1804.97
[Applause]

1818.059 --> 1824.2
a bitterly disappointed in your rest ad

1821.48 --> 1824.2
bitterly

1829.1 --> 1831.34
foreign

1844.399 --> 1849.7399999999998
well there is no without containment but

1846.5 --> 1851.72
yeah it's just going to equalize with

1849.74 --> 1853.159
the pressure that surrounds it that's

1851.72 --> 1856.76
what it does

1853.159 --> 1859.7
does wind have momentum no

1856.76 --> 1862.519
it's moving it doesn't have momentum

1859.7 --> 1864.679
it's just trying to find a lower

1862.519 --> 1867.98
pressure to equalize that's what it's

1864.679 --> 1869.539
doing it doesn't travel because a force

1867.98 --> 1872.24
was inserted

1869.539 --> 1874.34
it's only equalizing with the air

1872.24 --> 1878.32
pressures differential that surrounds it

1874.34 --> 1878.32
that's what it does it's not momentum

1879.26 --> 1884.12
it's not the same thing it's not doing

1881.24 --> 1886.22
that because a force was inserted into

1884.12 --> 1888.9799999999998
the material and it had to keep going

1886.22 --> 1891.7
which is what momentum is yeah it

1888.98 --> 1891.7
doesn't have that

1892.82 --> 1898.22
at all

1894.26 --> 1900.2
it's just displacing to the lower air

1898.22 --> 1902.72
pressure region that's what it's doing

1900.2 --> 1904.22
that's the only thing it's doing as soon

1902.72 --> 1905.8990000000001
as it's equalized there's no more

1904.22 --> 1909.08
movement

1905.899 --> 1912.0189999999998
because it doesn't have momentum

1909.08 --> 1916.0
it doesn't keep going once a force is

1912.019 --> 1916.0
inserted that's not how gases work

1923.059 --> 1926.84
thank you

1924.159 --> 1929.6000000000001
is spinning air also caused by pressure

1926.84 --> 1932.9599999999998
differential you bet your ass it is yeah

1929.6 --> 1935.9599999999998
now of course the way that gases

1932.96 --> 1938.72
displace themselves to lower air

1935.96 --> 1941.6000000000001
pressure differential spaces yeah is

1938.72 --> 1944.059
Guided by very specific patterns those

1941.6 --> 1945.74
patterns are classified

1944.059 --> 1948.94
as

1945.74 --> 1948.94
[ __ ] what's the word again

1949.46 --> 1955.94
turbulence aerodynamics yeah turbulence

1952.82 --> 1960.019
and aerodynamics these effects a tornado

1955.94 --> 1962.48
is a turbulent effect

1960.019 --> 1964.18
yeah it becomes like that

1962.48 --> 1965.3600000000001
because it can't just

1964.18 --> 1967.519
[Music]

1965.36 --> 1969.559
this place just like that no it's just

1967.519 --> 1973.22
like water down the drain it's gonna

1969.559 --> 1974.899
start to follow very specific patterns

1973.22 --> 1976.82
turbulence

1974.899 --> 1981.5
so yeah

1976.82 --> 1983.4189999999999
it's still just effectively gas going

1981.5 --> 1985.46
from high pressure to low pressure

1983.419 --> 1988.46
that's the only thing it really is is

1985.46 --> 1991.1000000000001
just when it gets kind of radical when

1988.46 --> 1992.72
the when the amounts or the differential

1991.1 --> 1994.9399999999998
becomes High

1992.72 --> 1998.779
and other conditions like the weather

1994.94 --> 2001.659
moist whatever you know meteorology

1998.779 --> 2004.899
when it's getting heavy then turbulence

2001.659 --> 2008.2
patterns start to emerge

2004.899 --> 2011.6789999999999
which are very specific and predictable

2008.2 --> 2014.32
but it is effectively still just gas

2011.679 --> 2016.8400000000001
pressure displacing from high pressure

2014.32 --> 2018.519
to low pressure that's all it is is not

2016.84 --> 2022.539
having momentum

2018.519 --> 2026.86
yeah and I mean gas pressure displacing

2022.539 --> 2029.98
like that could be super rough and like

2026.86 --> 2032.62
break off branches or whatever and maybe

2029.98 --> 2035.5
yeah in a tornado situation a branch

2032.62 --> 2037.779
could be carried by the wind

2035.5 --> 2040.6
and that Branch will Dam will have

2037.779 --> 2043.299
momentum right it is being carried by

2040.6 --> 2045.6399999999999
the wind it is building up the motion

2043.299 --> 2046.72
force and even if the the wind just

2045.64 --> 2049.54
suddenly like

2046.72 --> 2052.0
it's equal now the branch in the middle

2049.54 --> 2053.919
of the tornado will still keep flying

2052.0 --> 2055.48
and we'll go right through your window

2053.919 --> 2058.2999999999997
right

2055.48 --> 2061.54
because it is a solid and the solid can

2058.3 --> 2063.52
be carried around by the wind if it's

2061.54 --> 2066.52
strong enough

2063.52 --> 2070.54
and then it will build up the momentum

2066.52 --> 2072.579
but the air the gas itself does not it

2070.54 --> 2076.24
doesn't have momentum it's only trying

2072.579 --> 2079.0
to travel to the lower air pressure

2076.24 --> 2081.4599999999996
region that's all it's trying to do

2079.0 --> 2084.099
as soon as is equalized all the forces

2081.46 --> 2087.06
stop immediately that's how like a storm

2084.099 --> 2087.06
can just like

2088.379 --> 2094.5
and it's gone yeah

2091.0 --> 2097.599
if it had momentum that wouldn't happen

2094.5 --> 2099.76
it can't just disappear if it had

2097.599 --> 2101.8
momentum it doesn't because gas pressure

2099.76 --> 2104.5200000000004
doesn't have momentum it doesn't build

2101.8 --> 2104.52
up momentum

2104.8 --> 2110.94
hello flatter Sage can a bear

2107.859 --> 2110.94
Goldie mckerman

2123.64 --> 2130.7999999999997
yeah it is global propaganda what you

2127.06 --> 2130.7999999999997
just said George Sanford is ridiculous

2131.92 --> 2137.7000000000003
measure of linear momentum of molecule

2134.8 --> 2140.1600000000003
no absolutely not

2137.7 --> 2145.5989999999997
absolutely not

2140.16 --> 2149.3199999999997
it's no momentum with gases get the [ __ ]

2145.599 --> 2152.44
over it I don't care if you read it in

2149.32 --> 2155.079
Wiki or some Globe tart in a university

2152.44 --> 2157.96
told you that it's wrong

2155.079 --> 2160.2400000000002
it's provably wrong

2157.96 --> 2162.76
I've spent a lot of time and energy

2160.24 --> 2165.2799999999997
trying to explain it to you

2162.76 --> 2168.2200000000003
all together must be like a thousand

2165.28 --> 2171.0400000000004
hours or more that this specific subject

2168.22 --> 2174.64
I've tried to explain on my show and on

2171.04 --> 2179.099
fpd because it's true gas doesn't have

2174.64 --> 2179.0989999999997
momentum it doesn't work like that

2182.619 --> 2190.3
yeah if gas had momentum

2185.88 --> 2193.839
explosions wouldn't do anything

2190.3 --> 2197.579
yeah why are explosions so dramatic

2193.839 --> 2200.74
because out of absolutely nowhere

2197.579 --> 2202.8390000000004
boom massive pressure massive pressure

2200.74 --> 2206.9799999999996
differential everything like this starts

2202.839 --> 2208.96
to immediately displace yeah

2206.98 --> 2211.42
does it keep

2208.96 --> 2214.0
Rippling and Rippling and just trash

2211.42 --> 2215.44
everything once one explosion is set up

2214.0 --> 2218.44
no it doesn't

2215.44 --> 2221.32
because as soon as the gas pressure

2218.44 --> 2225.099
differential that's suddenly created is

2221.32 --> 2227.8590000000004
equalized it just stops and it's just

2225.099 --> 2230.98
still again very quickly

2227.859 --> 2233.0789999999997
yeah just a very short moment of extreme

2230.98 --> 2236.5
pressure differential

2233.079 --> 2239.98
it's dramatic it rips things apart

2236.5 --> 2242.079
but then it stops it goes away very

2239.98 --> 2246.339
quickly because the pressure equalized

2242.079 --> 2249.2200000000003
because it doesn't have momentum it

2246.339 --> 2250.599
doesn't keep on going with the inserted

2249.22 --> 2255.2999999999997
Force

2250.599 --> 2255.3
this is pure logical deduction

2257.38 --> 2260.98
when I blow up a balloon is the gas

2259.3 --> 2263.5600000000004
equalizing yeah

2260.98 --> 2266.26
you're inserting more pressure it

2263.56 --> 2268.7999999999997
equalizes within the containing within

2266.26 --> 2268.8
the containment

2275.02 --> 2281.98
yeah well George Sanford physics wrong

2279.52 --> 2283.78
that's wrong it's wrong it's provably

2281.98 --> 2286.3
wrong

2283.78 --> 2288.4
if that's what physicists say they

2286.3 --> 2292.7400000000002
should all be sued because it's wrong

2288.4 --> 2292.7400000000002
it's a lie it doesn't work like that

2293.14 --> 2298.2
I can prove that I could [ __ ] prove

2295.48 --> 2298.2
that in court

2298.839 --> 2301.38
okay

2302.74 --> 2308.2599999999998
gas doesn't have momentum it only

2305.619 --> 2310.48
responds to air pressure differential

2308.26 --> 2314.1400000000003
locally as soon as the air pressure

2310.48 --> 2317.079
differential is equalized

2314.14 --> 2319.24
all the force is gone

2317.079 --> 2321.82
everything all the force that was

2319.24 --> 2325.4799999999996
inserted that cause it is gone

2321.82 --> 2328.06
because it doesn't retain momentum it

2325.48 --> 2330.16
doesn't have any momentum gas doesn't

2328.06 --> 2333.82
have momentum it's not susceptible to it

2330.16 --> 2338.22
only solids and liquids are susceptible

2333.82 --> 2338.2200000000003
to momentum gases are not

2345.16 --> 2348.16
foreign

2352.66 --> 2355.66
foreign

2360.18 --> 2367.6189999999997
Sanford that's not the same thing that's

2363.46 --> 2367.619
the literal gas pressure itself

2367.78 --> 2372.82
that's the preponderance of the gas

2370.119 --> 2374.44
pressure that's oh my God it's not

2372.82 --> 2377.7400000000002
momentum

2374.44 --> 2381.28
that's not momentum

2377.74 --> 2384.2799999999997
that's equal pressure it's pressure it's

2381.28 --> 2385.5600000000004
not a motion it's not it's not a [ __ ]

2384.28 --> 2389.619
object

2385.56 --> 2393.339
doing that that's not what it is

2389.619 --> 2396.78
you get it yet that's not what it is

2393.339 --> 2396.7799999999997
stop saying that

2396.88 --> 2399.119
[ __ ]

2404.98 --> 2409.98
gonna have a hard time getting that back

2441.64 --> 2444.96
it's not momentum

2446.2 --> 2449.9199999999996
it's just wronged yards well I don't

2448.18 --> 2453.2799999999997
know why the [ __ ] you're doing this too

2449.92 --> 2457.02
I'm sick of it I'm sick of it stop

2453.28 --> 2460.6600000000003
inserting this [ __ ] it's wrong

2457.02 --> 2463.66
concede George Sanford

2460.66 --> 2465.64
don't go rest a hat on me with this [ __ ]

2463.66 --> 2468.8799999999997
concede

2465.64 --> 2471.22
you're wrong gas doesn't have momentum

2468.88 --> 2473.1400000000003
it's not the same thing

2471.22 --> 2475.18
don't you understand what I've been

2473.14 --> 2477.5989999999997
trying to explain in the last freaking

2475.18 --> 2480.8799999999997
40 minutes

2477.599 --> 2482.98
exclusively this for some reason why the

2480.88 --> 2485.079
[ __ ] is this so difficult to get this

2482.98 --> 2487.72
through your head

2485.079 --> 2491.099
it doesn't have momentum whatever

2487.72 --> 2494.9199999999996
supposed description gas behavior has

2491.099 --> 2498.04
one thing it doesn't momentum it doesn't

2494.92 --> 2501.7000000000003
have it it doesn't build it up it's just

2498.04 --> 2504.96
responding to pressure differential it's

2501.7 --> 2504.96
not momentum

2508.78 --> 2512.8590000000004
mass in motion

2511.0 --> 2515.5
yeah that's funny it's very funny

2512.859 --> 2518.7
because gas doesn't have mass

2515.5 --> 2522.099
yeah in that classical sense in that

2518.7 --> 2524.0789999999997
gravity-based sense in which mass is

2522.099 --> 2525.7000000000003
applied yeah

2524.079 --> 2528.579
doesn't have that

2525.7 --> 2531.52
gas doesn't have mass

2528.579 --> 2536.1400000000003
doesn't have weight

2531.52 --> 2539.98
yeah only contained pressurized gas

2536.14 --> 2542.68
can be weighed because in its gaseous

2539.98 --> 2545.2
state it doesn't have weight and it

2542.68 --> 2546.94
effectively doesn't have mass you could

2545.2 --> 2549.819
deduce it

2546.94 --> 2550.9
but effectively physically it doesn't

2549.819 --> 2553.3
have it

2550.9 --> 2556.02
doesn't have mass and it doesn't have

2553.3 --> 2556.02
momentum

2559.359 --> 2565.24
yeah Under Pressure yeah you know why

2561.7 --> 2570.0
Under Pressure because it's then not a

2565.24 --> 2570.0
gas anymore George Sanford

2570.64 --> 2572.819
foreign

2592.18 --> 2598.6189999999997
there's a lot of spider webs there at

2595.78 --> 2598.619
least I got it back

2615.64 --> 2619.9
why would you think gas under pressure

2618.04 --> 2622.54
is no longer gas

2619.9 --> 2625.78
why would you straw man the [ __ ] out of

2622.54 --> 2628.72
me like a globe tart George Sanford what

2625.78 --> 2630.52
the [ __ ] is wrong with you

2628.72 --> 2632.68
I mean are you in some kind of

2630.52 --> 2634.66
rebellious mood where you have to act

2632.68 --> 2637.18
like an anti-flat earth or even though

2634.66 --> 2639.22
you're supposedly not even that you're

2637.18 --> 2643.0
not supposed to be an anti-flat earther

2639.22 --> 2646.0
George Sanford stop acting like one

2643.0 --> 2646.0
foreign

2650.819 --> 2658.2599999999998
I really need that

2654.16 --> 2658.2599999999998
it's my frustrations getting high

2658.54 --> 2662.64
because that always happens when money's

2660.16 --> 2662.64
getting low

2662.88 --> 2669.48
whoa dudes

2666.22 --> 2669.48
holy [ __ ]

2669.76 --> 2674.44
bruh

2672.16 --> 2678.0989999999997
okay

2674.44 --> 2679.42
well that certainly changes things

2678.099 --> 2684.48
damn

2679.42 --> 2684.48
thank you so much guys holy [ __ ]

2690.819 --> 2694.66
you just said it you want to get a

2692.8 --> 2697.0600000000004
timeout George Sanford

2694.66 --> 2699.52
or you just don't like Arwin anymore

2697.06 --> 2702.22
because I get so angry are you looking

2699.52 --> 2704.319
an excuse to get banned out of my class

2702.22 --> 2707.56
because you don't really want to be here

2704.319 --> 2709.839
anymore George Sanford is that it you're

2707.56 --> 2711.94
just acting like an ass because you kind

2709.839 --> 2714.7
of want an excuse

2711.94 --> 2715.54
to be kicked out so you don't have to

2714.7 --> 2717.7
leave

2715.54 --> 2719.74
so you don't feel like

2717.7 --> 2720.8799999999997
like you're dropping out is that it is

2719.74 --> 2723.4199999999996
that why you're doing that George

2720.88 --> 2723.42
Sanford

2725.2 --> 2729.7
because dude if you don't want this

2728.079 --> 2733.599
anymore if you don't want to deal with

2729.7 --> 2735.2799999999997
what I do just [ __ ] leave

2733.599 --> 2739.06
yeah

2735.28 --> 2741.48
you don't have like School obligation to

2739.06 --> 2741.48
be here

2744.46 --> 2748.8
yeah Tony Whitcomb and flutters down

2748.9 --> 2751.44
laughs

2755.44 --> 2760.0
I've been waiting for that for some time

2758.319 --> 2764.44
because

2760.0 --> 2767.02
yeah I literally had zero cents on my

2764.44 --> 2769.0
bank account this morning zero that's

2767.02 --> 2770.92
like an accomplishment

2769.0 --> 2773.56
because it's really hard to actually get

2770.92 --> 2777.2400000000002
to the zero point but yeah it was there

2773.56 --> 2777.24
thank you so much

2780.579 --> 2785.92
I still want to keep going on this

2782.68 --> 2789.8799999999997
though because I just can't I can't

2785.92 --> 2793.56
I can't believe there's [ __ ] Flat

2789.88 --> 2793.56
Earth they're saying this [ __ ]

2794.2 --> 2800.0789999999997
gas doesn't have momentum it doesn't

2797.319 --> 2803.68
build it up it doesn't retain it

2800.079 --> 2805.0
linear angular it doesn't do that

2803.68 --> 2808.06
yeah

2805.0 --> 2811.8
the thing that's actually happening is

2808.06 --> 2816.46
air pressure differential

2811.8 --> 2820.1800000000003
Equalization and that's the only thing

2816.46 --> 2823.66
that happens to gas

2820.18 --> 2827.0789999999997
yeah and it's not the same it doesn't

2823.66 --> 2829.48
have any kind of relation to the

2827.079 --> 2833.7400000000002
Newtonian conception because it's

2829.48 --> 2836.98
Newtonian yeah momentum is Newtonian you

2833.74 --> 2839.02
understand that yeah excluding gospel if

2836.98 --> 2840.76
you do I need to remind you do we need

2839.02 --> 2843.94
to remind you that all Newtonian

2840.76 --> 2847.6600000000003
mechanics excludes gas behavior yeah you

2843.94 --> 2849.04
think I'm just making this [ __ ] up no I

2847.66 --> 2850.0589999999997
know what the [ __ ] I'm talking about

2849.04 --> 2853.7799999999997
yeah

2850.059 --> 2856.96
gas doesn't have momentum momentum being

2853.78 --> 2859.1800000000003
a Newtonian concept Newtonian mechanics

2856.96 --> 2862.42
only applying to

2859.18 --> 2864.04
solids and liquids

2862.42 --> 2866.5
yeah

2864.04 --> 2869.38
am I getting through to you yet

2866.5 --> 2871.119
am I getting through to you yet

2869.38 --> 2873.9
I know what I'm talking about I'm not

2871.119 --> 2873.9
making this up

2875.619 --> 2882.099
gas doesn't build up momentum

2879.16 --> 2884.319
you can't throw gas and it'll keep going

2882.099 --> 2886.78
it doesn't work like that it's

2884.319 --> 2888.579
immediately going to equalize with the

2886.78 --> 2891.599
pressure that surrounds it because

2888.579 --> 2897.28
that's the only Behavior

2891.599 --> 2900.1600000000003
it has when it comes to forces

2897.28 --> 2902.3390000000004
yeah it just equalizes that's what it

2900.16 --> 2902.339
does

2906.579 --> 2910.8590000000004
oh your email was wrong was that the

2908.559 --> 2910.8590000000004
issue

2912.819 --> 2918.22
ah okay well I'm glad you got that

2914.859 --> 2920.02
sorted out I'm glad a lot literally a

2918.22 --> 2924.1189999999997
lot on my bank account thank you very

2920.02 --> 2924.119
much man you've really saved my week

2924.4 --> 2929.44
yeah

2925.66 --> 2931.5989999999997
yeah guys I really did get kind of a big

2929.44 --> 2934.78
big donation there thank you very much

2931.599 --> 2937.0
Tony really and and not to forget

2934.78 --> 2939.4
flatter stage two because his donation

2937.0 --> 2941.88
was also sizable

2939.4 --> 2941.88
man

2943.66 --> 2946.859
it's a crazy week

2950.079 --> 2953.44
why do I feel the breeze when I stand in

2952.24 --> 2957.16
front of a fan

2953.44 --> 2960.7200000000003
because the fan a solid object

2957.16 --> 2964.839
causes a local air pressure differential

2960.72 --> 2966.4599999999996
directly next to the fan

2964.839 --> 2969.46
that gas

2966.46 --> 2971.7400000000002
which is pressurized at that spot right

2969.46 --> 2974.52
in front of the fan it's pressurized

2971.74 --> 2978.0989999999997
behind the fan is depressurized the

2974.52 --> 2980.74
depressurized gas will suck in more gas

2978.099 --> 2984.52
of its surrounding to equalize the

2980.74 --> 2987.0989999999997
pressure yeah while the slightly

2984.52 --> 2989.68
heightened pressure in front of it is

2987.099 --> 2993.6400000000003
trying to expand

2989.68 --> 2996.46
into the air pressure surrounding it

2993.64 --> 2999.22
which is slightly less

2996.46 --> 3003.2400000000002
just keeps moving like that and that's

2999.22 --> 3006.2999999999997
how you then feel the moisture of your

3003.24 --> 3009.4799999999996
skin evaporating which happens when gas

3006.3 --> 3012.8390000000004
typically rushes past it and that's why

3009.48 --> 3015.78
you feel a cool breeze yeah

3012.839 --> 3019.099
all because of air pressure differential

3015.78 --> 3022.26
attempting to equalize while being

3019.099 --> 3027.42
persistently unbalanced

3022.26 --> 3029.28
by solid objects displacing it causing a

3027.42 --> 3031.8
persistent air pressure differential

3029.28 --> 3033.98
that's what you experience is that clear

3031.8 --> 3033.98
enough

3034.02 --> 3039.079
punista

3035.78 --> 3039.079
putinista whatever

3044.7 --> 3051.18
it's not building momentum if if a fan

3047.7 --> 3053.8799999999997
could build up momentum with gas they

3051.18 --> 3057.5589999999997
will be dangerous yeah can you imagine

3053.88 --> 3057.559
having a fan on

3057.9 --> 3062.819
then you turn it off and it keeps on

3060.48 --> 3064.26
blowing because it has momentum oh it

3062.819 --> 3067.4
keeps going yeah yeah

3064.26 --> 3070.7400000000002
let's do that you turn the fan off

3067.4 --> 3073.26
immediately everything becomes still why

3070.74 --> 3075.24
because there's no more persistent air

3073.26 --> 3078.6600000000003
pressure differential being artificially

3075.24 --> 3081.54
created which keeps the flow going so

3078.66 --> 3084.66
the pressure immediately equalizes

3081.54 --> 3090.42
there's no more displacement yeah why

3084.66 --> 3090.42
because gas doesn't retain momentum

3091.14 --> 3093.3799999999997
foreign

3098.07 --> 3104.6400000000003
[Music]

3101.359 --> 3106.859
water ice snow but not steam that's

3104.64 --> 3109.2599999999998
correct

3106.859 --> 3111.5
steam is not gonna retain momentum

3109.26 --> 3111.5
either

3111.72 --> 3114.68
because it's a gas

3121.559 --> 3125.4
what about when you're moving in a car

3123.72 --> 3127.859
and stick your hand out of the window is

3125.4 --> 3130.559
that the same effect yeah

3127.859 --> 3134.0989999999997
yeah because you're actually the thing

3130.559 --> 3137.3390000000004
moving the gas outside is on average

3134.099 --> 3139.2000000000003
trying to stand still but if you move

3137.339 --> 3140.64
just like this

3139.2 --> 3144.0
yeah

3140.64 --> 3146.7
you're by doing this are creating a

3144.0 --> 3148.02
slight air pressure build up in front of

3146.7 --> 3150.7799999999997
your hands

3148.02 --> 3154.14
and a slight decrease behind your hands

3150.78 --> 3157.44
the gas is turn going to move around

3154.14 --> 3159.42
that in order to keep equalizing it and

3157.44 --> 3161.66
that's what you feel as it breathes so

3159.42 --> 3161.66
yeah

3175.559 --> 3180.0
uh by the way the title for today's show

3177.78 --> 3182.46
is completely wasted on this

3180.0 --> 3184.74
too bad but I thought dingleberry

3182.46 --> 3187.02
dependency was kind of hilarious I think

3184.74 --> 3189.54
it applies more to like the flatter

3187.02 --> 3191.16
debates

3189.54 --> 3193.5
you know what it what it means right

3191.16 --> 3196.02
dingleberry dependency is where you use

3193.5 --> 3198.54
everything you use it's a flat plane

3196.02 --> 3200.46
but then you conjure a ball Earth

3198.54 --> 3202.92
underneath it in your mind so you have

3200.46 --> 3205.8
this flat plane that's reality and then

3202.92 --> 3208.6800000000003
oh look but mathematically there's the

3205.8 --> 3212.099
ball Earth supposed to be there that's

3208.68 --> 3215.16
the dingleberry Earth dependency

3212.099 --> 3217.44
see flat plane because everything about

3215.16 --> 3221.0589999999997
the globe model is based off flat Lanes

3217.44 --> 3223.68
everything every every little detail

3221.059 --> 3227.0400000000004
every single little detail about the

3223.68 --> 3229.859
globe model is based on flat plane every

3227.04 --> 3230.94
conceivable little detail of the globe

3229.859 --> 3234.0
model

3230.94 --> 3236.339
but they still got to conjure up the

3234.0 --> 3238.8
ball Earth somewhere so they do it

3236.339 --> 3241.2599999999998
underneath it they do it like oh but

3238.8 --> 3243.3590000000004
yeah it looks so flat but it's actually

3241.26 --> 3245.28
a ball underneath so in their diagrams

3243.359 --> 3247.5589999999997
it's always a flat plane perfect flat

3245.28 --> 3250.1400000000003
line and then the ball underneath it

3247.559 --> 3254.0400000000004
well the guys

3250.14 --> 3257.2799999999997
at fed basically called that phenomenon

3254.04 --> 3258.48
the mathematical conjured phenomenon a

3257.28 --> 3260.94
dingleberry

3258.48 --> 3263.48
dingleberry Earth I think I thought it's

3260.94 --> 3263.48
hilarious

3264.24 --> 3266.24
um

3269.66 --> 3274.2
non-Newtonian gas what the [ __ ] does

3271.98 --> 3277.559
that even mean

3274.2 --> 3280.3999999999996
what is what is Newtonian gas

3277.559 --> 3280.4
what what

3296.04 --> 3303.839
dude don't don't freaking add home

3300.48 --> 3306.7400000000002
my chat participants Putin is that after

3303.839 --> 3309.0
a ridiculous statement like that

3306.74 --> 3309.9599999999996
non-Newtonian gas that doesn't make any

3309.0 --> 3313.14
sense

3309.96 --> 3317.96
known at home my chat

3313.14 --> 3317.96
that's that's [ __ ] stop it

3321.599 --> 3326.52
is non-Newtonian

3324.24 --> 3329.2799999999997
now that's not what I said what I said

3326.52 --> 3331.799
is Newtonian mechanics doesn't apply to

3329.28 --> 3334.3190000000004
gases that's what I said doesn't have to

3331.799 --> 3336.68
do with the nature of the substance of

3334.319 --> 3336.68
gas

3336.92 --> 3342.299
substances are not Newtonian or

3339.96 --> 3345.2400000000002
non-Newtonian

3342.299 --> 3348.72
it's the mechanics it's the system of

3345.24 --> 3350.52
Newton's mechanics that doesn't include

3348.72 --> 3353.8799999999997
gas behavior

3350.52 --> 3357.119
that doesn't make gas non-Newtonian

3353.88 --> 3361.559
yeah substances are not Newtonian or

3357.119 --> 3363.319
non-Newtonian Newtons model is just that

3361.559 --> 3367.44
a model

3363.319 --> 3370.2599999999998
substances are not Newtonian

3367.44 --> 3372.119
this is a very weird thing to State like

3370.26 --> 3373.98
that

3372.119 --> 3375.6600000000003
that's where you all get the [ __ ] out of

3373.98 --> 3378.26
here you scum

3375.66 --> 3378.2599999999998
skunk get the

3381.18 --> 3383.96
F uh

3394.559 --> 3397.559
right

3398.099 --> 3403.1400000000003
anyway I hope I made that damn well

3400.799 --> 3407.099
clear enough by now

3403.14 --> 3411.2599999999998
don't want to go over it another hour

3407.099 --> 3411.26
because this is kind of draining yeah

3416.22 --> 3420.72
but you like that troll why

3422.64 --> 3425.9
why do you like a troll

3448.98 --> 3455.16
you what's easy to poke

3451.5 --> 3458.16
okay well just save it for fed chat okay

3455.16 --> 3461.16
it's too distracting to have those types

3458.16 --> 3464.339
of back and forth in my chat

3461.16 --> 3468.02
I much prefer you guys just listen and

3464.339 --> 3468.02
kind of communicate with me

3474.48 --> 3479.76
[ __ ]

3477.0 --> 3482.52
uh no

3479.76 --> 3484.7990000000004
no you don't make a [ __ ] sock account

3482.52 --> 3487.819
and go back to doing the same thing in

3484.799 --> 3487.819
my chat ass

3494.28 --> 3497.2400000000002
foreign

3503.42 --> 3509.819
but anyway I hope that I

3506.16 --> 3512.2799999999997
I got the message across right and I

3509.819 --> 3514.38
mean like seriously

3512.28 --> 3518.1600000000003
if you think I'm wrong

3514.38 --> 3521.46
then do actual deep research and I'll

3518.16 --> 3525.0
bet you might find more flaws

3521.46 --> 3528.48
in the actual official stories right

3525.0 --> 3531.299
because yeah yeah if you Google choreo's

3528.48 --> 3533.52
effect it will tell you that about the

3531.299 --> 3537.299
freaking earth spin the ball earth spin

3533.52 --> 3540.299
[ __ ] right yeah so just because you

3537.299 --> 3542.22
read something about gas supposedly

3540.299 --> 3544.92
having momentum

3542.22 --> 3546.5989999999997
it doesn't mean that's actually correct

3544.92 --> 3549.839
right

3546.599 --> 3554.04
but I I'd love to see more feedback

3549.839 --> 3556.68
about it so if you find something

3554.04 --> 3560.099
yeah if you find something about this

3556.68 --> 3562.98
what I just talked about gas supposedly

3560.099 --> 3565.44
suggested to have momentum somehow

3562.98 --> 3568.619
and I'd love to see more deep research

3565.44 --> 3570.839
about that with quotations and sources

3568.619 --> 3573.42
that is kind of important right because

3570.839 --> 3577.2
then because then

3573.42 --> 3579.7200000000003
I could maybe figure out if the

3577.2 --> 3582.18
established community of science

3579.72 --> 3584.819
whatever you know the physics Community

3582.18 --> 3587.7
or the controllers whoever is just

3584.819 --> 3590.099
telling us what to learn in school

3587.7 --> 3593.16
that they may be

3590.099 --> 3595.02
just muffled it under the carpet on

3593.16 --> 3597.5989999999997
purpose

3595.02 --> 3600.059
that they did suggest gas have momentum

3597.599 --> 3602.3590000000004
and then I'd like to see more detail on

3600.059 --> 3602.3590000000004
how

3627.359 --> 3632.94
I knew it I knew I was gonna bump into

3631.2 --> 3635.7
something I'd recognize yeah yeah yeah

3632.94 --> 3638.4
hey anger management

3635.7 --> 3641.52
where in nature though do ideal gases

3638.4 --> 3644.46
exist yeah this is brilliant your ideal

3641.52 --> 3645.78
gas law yeah so where does that exist in

3644.46 --> 3649.68
nature

3645.78 --> 3654.9
or are you going to concede now that

3649.68 --> 3656.48
that's only a conceptual model that's

3654.9 --> 3661.2000000000003
not actually

3656.48 --> 3661.2
scientifically proven ah

3661.619 --> 3667.94
ideal gases don't exist it's only a

3665.76 --> 3667.94
model

3670.26 --> 3675.38
yeah

3672.119 --> 3678.599
so it's very cute the suggestion

3675.38 --> 3681.0
Newton's Laws of Motion this is the way

3678.599 --> 3683.579
they apply tickets yeah yeah but it

3681.0 --> 3685.98
doesn't actually do that it's just a

3683.579 --> 3689.1600000000003
suggestion there's no physical proof

3685.98 --> 3691.76
that they do yeah gas does not have

3689.16 --> 3691.7599999999998
momentum

3691.98 --> 3698.76
if you expose gas buildup

3694.98 --> 3701.4
somewhere to lower gas pressure it's

3698.76 --> 3703.3390000000004
gonna expand in all directions and then

3701.4 --> 3707.339
immediately stop

3703.339 --> 3711.0
immediately stop once it's equalized it

3707.339 --> 3714.599
doesn't bounce off the wall

3711.0 --> 3717.839
the wall doesn't stop it

3714.599 --> 3720.42
yeah it just equalizes

3717.839 --> 3722.22
it equalizes and it immediately lose

3720.42 --> 3724.92
loses

3722.22 --> 3728.9399999999996
its displacement ability

3724.92 --> 3731.819
it stops right because it's not momentum

3728.94 --> 3733.26
it has nothing to do with the concept of

3731.819 --> 3737.24
momentum

3733.26 --> 3737.2400000000002
right the convention of momentum

3737.339 --> 3741.72
it's not momentum that's not what it is

3739.859 --> 3745.339
it's not what it does it doesn't work

3741.72 --> 3746.9399999999996
that way yeah momentum

3745.339 --> 3749.88
signifies

3746.94 --> 3752.28
if you insert a force somehow through

3749.88 --> 3756.0
displacement it's going to keep going

3752.28 --> 3760.079
even though the force is no longer

3756.0 --> 3763.14
inserted yeah that's momentum you insert

3760.079 --> 3766.92
a force start to move your arm you throw

3763.14 --> 3769.5589999999997
it you throw the ball you let it go once

3766.92 --> 3771.359
you let it go you're no longer inserting

3769.559 --> 3773.94
the force with your arm

3771.359 --> 3776.299
but it still keeps going after you let

3773.94 --> 3779.339
it go why

3776.299 --> 3782.22
pains momentum

3779.339 --> 3784.2
yeah gas doesn't do that

3782.22 --> 3785.9399999999996
it just doesn't

3784.2 --> 3788.46
I don't care

3785.94 --> 3790.68
that you think that somehow it should or

3788.46 --> 3794.359
whatever it doesn't do that it just

3790.68 --> 3794.359
doesn't it's not momentum

3796.079 --> 3800.76
demonstrate a gas molecule

3798.839 --> 3803.88
that doesn't conform to the loss of

3800.76 --> 3805.619
moment excuse me demonstrate a gas

3803.88 --> 3808.799
molecule anger management can you

3805.619 --> 3813.6600000000003
demonstrate this gas molecule to me

3808.799 --> 3816.96
go ahead demonstrate a gas molecule

3813.66 --> 3819.839
yeah show me show me a singular gas

3816.96 --> 3822.359
molecule good luck with that yeah

3819.839 --> 3825.0
and then if you if you succeed in doing

3822.359 --> 3826.4
that somehow you do you want

3825.0 --> 3830.94
then then

3826.4 --> 3832.619
which means never then I'll show you how

3830.94 --> 3834.2400000000002
it doesn't conform to the laws of

3832.619 --> 3836.2200000000003
momentum that thing that you can't show

3834.24 --> 3839.22
me because it doesn't exist

3836.22 --> 3842.1189999999997
yeah you can't isolate a singular gas

3839.22 --> 3845.64
molecule and yeah

3842.119 --> 3847.7400000000002
systems models that apply to ideal gas

3845.64 --> 3850.5
laws yeah

3847.74 --> 3854.9399999999996
all that ideal gases yeah yeah the thing

3850.5 --> 3857.88
about ideal gases is they don't exist

3854.94 --> 3859.14
admittedly

3857.88 --> 3862.079
yeah

3859.14 --> 3863.52
so it's all cute models it doesn't exist

3862.079 --> 3867.48
yeah

3863.52 --> 3870.68
a separated gas molecule doesn't exist

3867.48 --> 3874.26
you can't demonstrate that this is all

3870.68 --> 3875.94
conceptual it's all conceptual squirt

3874.26 --> 3878.76
workings

3875.94 --> 3881.28
Mr anger management

3878.76 --> 3883.6800000000003
none of it actually applies to physical

3881.28 --> 3886.1600000000003
reality it's all conceptual what you're

3883.68 --> 3886.16
talking about

3891.299 --> 3894.2599999999998
hello Crow

3898.2 --> 3902.52
can you demonstrate anything at all

3900.24 --> 3904.5589999999997
excuse me but I've already done

3902.52 --> 3907.74
literally on camera demonstrations

3904.559 --> 3910.5
example demonstrations I literally have

3907.74 --> 3914.839
done physical example demonstrations

3910.5 --> 3914.839
here on my show live on camera

3915.059 --> 3921.599
yeah I demonstrated

3918.119 --> 3924.359
how gas pressure differential works how

3921.599 --> 3926.7000000000003
gas doesn't have momentum how a physical

3924.359 --> 3929.9
object does have momentum I physically

3926.7 --> 3929.8999999999996
demonstrated that

3930.059 --> 3935.3390000000004
yeah so I can absolutely demonstrate

3932.94 --> 3938.099
things and I have you haven't you've

3935.339 --> 3943.0789999999997
just brought forward conceptual models

3938.099 --> 3944.3590000000004
based on ideal non-existent things and

3943.079 --> 3948.48
isolated

3944.359 --> 3950.7599999999998
molecules that don't exist admittedly

3948.48 --> 3955.16
all of that is admitted that it doesn't

3950.76 --> 3955.1600000000003
actually exist you numpty

3955.38 --> 3960.559
why do you think you have an argument

3957.359 --> 3960.5589999999997
here you don't

3965.359 --> 3973.0789999999997
the whole of science you mean the whole

3968.94 --> 3976.079
of science without the W yeah

3973.079 --> 3978.319
I'm debunking that whole science your

3976.079 --> 3978.319
ass

3979.26 --> 3982.7000000000003
because [ __ ] comes out

3999.72 --> 4002.0789999999997
foreign

4007.059 --> 4011.42
get the [ __ ] out of here dude I don't

4009.44 --> 4013.579
know why I wasted time this is all just

4011.42 --> 4016.099
anti-flat Earth or numpties

4013.579 --> 4018.7400000000002
making soccer counts and

4016.099 --> 4020.7200000000003
trying to get in my face doing that it

4018.74 --> 4021.74
doesn't work I address everything you

4020.72 --> 4023.5389999999998
say

4021.74 --> 4026.5389999999998
with references

4023.539 --> 4027.559
give even physical demonstrations on

4026.539 --> 4030.6800000000003
camera

4027.559 --> 4033.079
and then you go bitching and whining and

4030.68 --> 4036.2599999999998
AD homing and then you get banned

4033.079 --> 4038.8390000000004
yeah and I don't mind doing that because

4036.26 --> 4045.92
I already got everything out of you that

4038.839 --> 4050.24
I need yeah I can use you like a slave I

4045.92 --> 4053.78
can use you numpties like slaves

4050.24 --> 4056.4199999999996
to actually produce for me according to

4053.78 --> 4058.579
my will and bidding

4056.42 --> 4060.5
and then when I'm done with you and

4058.579 --> 4063.98
there's nothing more productive coming

4060.5 --> 4067.28
out of you that I can utilize and I ban

4063.98 --> 4070.16
you and I discard you like a piece of

4067.28 --> 4072.26
trash that you really are

4070.16 --> 4075.6189999999997
so do come back

4072.26 --> 4078.8590000000004
and I'll do it again yeah because you

4075.619 --> 4083.48
love being treated like trash the trash

4078.859 --> 4086.839
that you are so go ahead do it again

4083.48 --> 4089.0
prove how stupid you are again

4086.839 --> 4092.319
and I'll do the same thing over and over

4089.0 --> 4092.319
again all right

4096.14 --> 4100.64
that slow-mo movie of course he made

4099.14 --> 4104.56
that soccer count today what do you

4100.64 --> 4104.56
expect this is all just one guy

4110.719 --> 4114.58
yeah the thing though is that

4116.12 --> 4121.339
I'm not allowing you to make sock

4118.219 --> 4123.199
accounts just the wine and banter with

4121.339 --> 4125.719
other people in chat

4123.199 --> 4128.659
that's not tolerable either you bring in

4125.719 --> 4129.859
a claim and a piece of data or some

4128.659 --> 4132.3189999999995
proof

4129.859 --> 4135.620000000001
some good references

4132.319 --> 4138.620000000001
or you stay the [ __ ] out and I keep

4135.62 --> 4141.98
Banning your sock accounts

4138.62 --> 4144.3189999999995
yeah when I ban you

4141.98 --> 4146.959999999999
that's not a sign to make a sock account

4144.319 --> 4150.02
and just start stupid pointless banter

4146.96 --> 4152.719
with other people in my chat yeah

4150.02 --> 4154.52
you should either come back and you try

4152.719 --> 4158.12
again you make more effort you bring

4154.52 --> 4159.38
more value to the chat or you stay the

4158.12 --> 4162.58
[ __ ] out

4159.38 --> 4162.58
that's how it works

4168.339 --> 4172.6
uh

4170.06 --> 4172.6
all right

4176.069 --> 4179.269
[Music]

4182.299 --> 4186.08
how do molecules molecules and

4184.699 --> 4188.299
pressurized gas

4186.08 --> 4189.5
in a container continue to collide with

4188.299 --> 4192.759
each other and the walls of the

4189.5 --> 4192.759
container without losing energy

4192.92 --> 4199.219
well have you ever considered that maybe

4195.62 --> 4202.76
that's because it's a model

4199.219 --> 4204.5
yeah the idea of you remember you'd get

4202.76 --> 4206.860000000001
a drawing and then you have the little

4204.5 --> 4209.48
dots and then

4206.86 --> 4212.54
all it bounced on each other and on the

4209.48 --> 4215.178999999999
yeah that's because that's conceptual

4212.54 --> 4218.179
that's not actually literally what

4215.179 --> 4221.2390000000005
happens you can't physically demonstrate

4218.179 --> 4223.52
that you can't isolate the gas molecules

4221.239 --> 4227.78
in order to demonstrate that don't you

4223.52 --> 4231.620000000001
understand it's purely conceptual that's

4227.78 --> 4235.219
not actually what happens but as a model

4231.62 --> 4238.82
it's proven to be very sufficient in

4235.219 --> 4241.219
order to explain gas behavior it's just

4238.82 --> 4244.159
not literally that

4241.219 --> 4246.86
because she can't isolate a gas molecule

4244.159 --> 4249.0199999999995
you can't isolate a single molecule like

4246.86 --> 4252.86
that and then have it behave like this

4249.02 --> 4256.820000000001
it's conceptual it's a framework kind of

4252.86 --> 4258.799999999999
based in mathematics to show you what it

4256.82 --> 4262.28
is roughly like

4258.8 --> 4264.7390000000005
right you translate the actual gas to

4262.28 --> 4267.199
conceptual little balls and then you can

4264.739 --> 4270.259999999999
use them as isolated little balls for

4267.199 --> 4273.5
mathematical modeling and they can mimic

4270.26 --> 4277.88
gas behavior pretty decently like that

4273.5 --> 4280.46
it's not actually little balls though

4277.88 --> 4283.159000000001
we don't know what it is can't isolate

4280.46 --> 4284.54
it I can have you ever seen a gas

4283.159 --> 4287.839999999999
molecule

4284.54 --> 4291.64
underneath an electron microscope huh

4287.84 --> 4291.64
have you I haven't

4292.94 --> 4298.12
seriously it's it's only a model

4302.96 --> 4309.04
does a pressure gauge

4305.239 --> 4309.04
measured the gas hitting the wall

4309.739 --> 4312.739
uh

4317.06 --> 4321.679
well

4318.679 --> 4324.08
pressure like actual pressure is

4321.679 --> 4325.9400000000005
measured by basically comparing it to

4324.08 --> 4329.54
other pressure

4325.94 --> 4331.94
right that's the only that's a barometer

4329.54 --> 4333.679
that's the only way it's done you you

4331.94 --> 4336.62
compare the pressure to another pressure

4333.679 --> 4339.26
now if you want that reading to be

4336.62 --> 4342.5599999999995
stable and persistent then you got to

4339.26 --> 4344.900000000001
use an isolated pressure chamber that is

4342.56 --> 4347.360000000001
super stable that's never going to

4344.9 --> 4350.0599999999995
change its pressure pressure over time

4347.36 --> 4353.36
right then you have a very stable

4350.06 --> 4355.52
anchored pressure chamber to compare

4353.36 --> 4357.92
other pressures with it that's how you

4355.52 --> 4360.860000000001
get pressure readings it's always

4357.92 --> 4364.179
comparing one pressure to another that's

4360.86 --> 4366.86
it that's all it is

4364.179 --> 4370.64
yeah if you don't have a pressure

4366.86 --> 4372.98
chamber then you can't measure pressure

4370.64 --> 4376.3
from gases you just can

4372.98 --> 4376.299999999999
it doesn't work

4381.8 --> 4388.88
yeah the hitting of the wall of gas

4385.58 --> 4391.699
molecules is theoretical

4388.88 --> 4393.92
it presses against it and then it's

4391.699 --> 4396.139999999999
assumed that that pressure is going to

4393.92 --> 4397.76
redivide itself and equally right it

4396.14 --> 4399.62
just becomes equally pressured because

4397.76 --> 4401.84
that's what gases do

4399.62 --> 4403.76
remember that why they don't have

4401.84 --> 4406.88
momentum

4403.76 --> 4409.64
because gas tries to find equal pressure

4406.88 --> 4411.4400000000005
it's going to neutralize the gas

4409.64 --> 4415.6
pressure differential

4411.44 --> 4415.599999999999
and that includes the container wall

4417.92 --> 4424.78
what is the technique to use use to

4421.219 --> 4424.78
maintain very constant pressure

4426.92 --> 4432.92
I don't know

4429.38 --> 4436.46
dude I'm not like I know some things

4432.92 --> 4439.58
about like gas pressure physics

4436.46 --> 4442.58
I'm not actually like a like an a

4439.58 --> 4445.46
Pneumatic engineer or anything

4442.58 --> 4448.159
I don't know like the literal mechanisms

4445.46 --> 4450.9800000000005
too much I know how they measure gas

4448.159 --> 4453.199
pressure it's by using a pressure system

4450.98 --> 4455.0
and then comparing that and has to be

4453.199 --> 4457.4
very stable that's that's one thing I I

4455.0 --> 4459.32
don't literally know about the latest

4457.4 --> 4462.62
piece of engineering they use or

4459.32 --> 4467.12
anything I don't know

4462.62 --> 4470.0199999999995
ask a Pneumatic engineer pneumatic

4467.12 --> 4470.0199999999995
engineer you know

4477.62 --> 4481.659
so yeah I don't know how to do that

4481.94 --> 4486.139999999999
I guess it's it falls under climate

4484.52 --> 4489.14
control

4486.14 --> 4492.62
right if you if you search on climate

4489.14 --> 4494.360000000001
control systems you'll probably find a a

4492.62 --> 4497.0
description on roughly how they do that

4494.36 --> 4499.339999999999
or maybe not they'll just say it

4497.0 --> 4501.56
right

4499.34 --> 4504.08
because I don't know maybe that's like a

4501.56 --> 4506.120000000001
secret craft technique that they kind of

4504.08 --> 4507.92
want to keep so that people will keep

4506.12 --> 4510.86
hiring them and not just do it

4507.92 --> 4514.76
themselves I don't know

4510.86 --> 4516.0199999999995
I'm not a pressure like a a Pneumatic

4514.76 --> 4517.46
engineer

4516.02 --> 4520.219
pneumatic

4517.46 --> 4522.26
that's how you say it right pneumatic

4520.219 --> 4525.58
with yes with the p

4522.26 --> 4525.58
weird silent p

4532.07 --> 4536.5
[Applause]

4533.4 --> 4536.5
[Music]

4542.6 --> 4546.64
hello Natura Wallace good to see you

4547.94 --> 4554.0
hey hello Julia Patman right away

4552.08 --> 4556.88
man that

4554.0 --> 4560.679
that PayPal infusion earlier certainly

4556.88 --> 4560.679
has like really boosted me

4562.1 --> 4567.26
I feel so relieved guys I was literally

4564.5 --> 4569.719
like Yay I'm not going to be able to

4567.26 --> 4574.04
smoke anything drink anything or have

4569.719 --> 4577.0
dinner after this now I will be able

4574.04 --> 4577.0
so yeah

4578.54 --> 4581.44
hmm

4587.36 --> 4591.86
oh god oh so you're just going Larry

4590.0 --> 4593.78
with the March I'm not gonna ban you for

4591.86 --> 4596.239
that because you're just dumb or you

4593.78 --> 4599.179
didn't pay attention earlier

4596.239 --> 4600.44
or you're just dumb probably last

4599.179 --> 4602.42
uh

4600.44 --> 4604.759999999999
but yeah

4602.42 --> 4607.1
if gases don't have momentum how can the

4604.76 --> 4611.900000000001
gas is coming out of a jet engine blow

4607.1 --> 4613.34
over a car because it's a higher

4611.9 --> 4616.759999999999
pressure

4613.34 --> 4617.900000000001
then the gases that surround it yeah the

4616.76 --> 4621.320000000001
regular air

4617.9 --> 4624.08
so it's going to push it's going to push

4621.32 --> 4625.34
in all directions and since it can't

4624.08 --> 4628.28
really

4625.34 --> 4630.92
go in a certain direction which is like

4628.28 --> 4633.8
the direction of the plane it's going to

4630.92 --> 4636.5
push it Forward while at the same time

4633.8 --> 4639.320000000001
pushing a lot of pressure backward

4636.5 --> 4642.44
that's going to displace the jet forward

4639.32 --> 4643.94
the jet a physical object is going to

4642.44 --> 4647.12
retain momentum

4643.94 --> 4649.639999999999
yeah the gases however coming out of

4647.12 --> 4651.739
that engine are not

4649.64 --> 4654.02
they're just trying to find equal

4651.739 --> 4656.299999999999
pressure as quickly as possible

4654.02 --> 4658.52
they don't retain momentum the airplane

4656.3 --> 4662.4400000000005
however will

4658.52 --> 4662.4400000000005
because it is a solid object

4673.88 --> 4680.179
if there is less gas then can feel the

4677.06 --> 4683.780000000001
good what what does that mean

4680.179 --> 4686.06
gases always fill the container

4683.78 --> 4688.639999999999
and equal pressure has nothing to do

4686.06 --> 4691.76
with that yeah just because gas expands

4688.64 --> 4694.34
to fill the available volume

4691.76 --> 4696.1990000000005
doesn't automatically imply it's always

4694.34 --> 4697.88
going to perfectly equalize because

4696.199 --> 4700.5199999999995
there's other influences like

4697.88 --> 4704.3
temperature influences right it's been

4700.52 --> 4706.6990000000005
proven we have a separated container

4704.3 --> 4708.860000000001
with gas in it and you subject that

4706.699 --> 4710.9
container isolated

4708.86 --> 4713.299999999999
with temperatures

4710.9 --> 4715.82
on one side you put cold in the other

4713.3 --> 4720.26
side you put heat it's going to cause a

4715.82 --> 4723.5599999999995
gradient right so no not all gases will

4720.26 --> 4725.780000000001
automatically distribute equally within

4723.56 --> 4728.0
the available container once they find

4725.78 --> 4730.46
their stability

4728.0 --> 4732.92
but if there's a sudden air pressure

4730.46 --> 4736.219
differential a gas pressure differential

4732.92 --> 4738.5
in there somewhere then it will quickly

4736.219 --> 4741.44
equalize

4738.5 --> 4744.26
within what is there

4741.44 --> 4746.54
right so the gradient is kind of a

4744.26 --> 4748.04
separate effect it is caused by

4746.54 --> 4751.64
something else that's not the natural

4748.04 --> 4754.1
state if there was no temperature

4751.64 --> 4756.320000000001
exchange somehow if there was no heat

4754.1 --> 4758.659000000001
and ground level here in the realm and

4756.32 --> 4761.96
there was no cold up there

4758.659 --> 4764.48
then yeah we might not really have this

4761.96 --> 4767.62
gas pressure gradient that we do oh crap

4764.48 --> 4767.62
my camera is dead

4769.82 --> 4772.82
why

4774.5 --> 4779.56
why

4776.12 --> 4779.5599999999995
I didn't even touch it

4786.26 --> 4793.54
what causes the loss of momentum

4789.86 --> 4793.54
loss of momentum

4793.699 --> 4800.12
what causes the what

4796.94 --> 4802.759999999999
what causes the loss of momentum when

4800.12 --> 4807.5
material changes from liquid to gas

4802.76 --> 4811.6990000000005
well it's simple material in that

4807.5 --> 4815.0
transfers into gaseous State loses its

4811.699 --> 4817.339999999999
mass its effective Mass which is the

4815.0 --> 4820.04
factor theoretically at least

4817.34 --> 4822.7390000000005
which allows it to retain momentum and

4820.04 --> 4824.3
gas doesn't have that yeah I keep saying

4822.739 --> 4826.94
that and then you keep squirting about

4824.3 --> 4829.360000000001
it even it says in my physics book

4826.94 --> 4832.4
everything has mass

4829.36 --> 4834.5
my my chemistry book says that gases

4832.4 --> 4837.08
have mass look at us in molecular weight

4834.5 --> 4840.08
yes I know it says that doesn't mean

4837.08 --> 4843.92
that it's literally true though

4840.08 --> 4846.139
yeah it's just a derived thing

4843.92 --> 4847.639
calculated it's not literal it doesn't

4846.139 --> 4849.5
have mass

4847.639 --> 4851.84
so that if it had mass then it would

4849.5 --> 4855.32
have momentum it doesn't

4851.84 --> 4859.52
so the mass is just gone why I don't

4855.32 --> 4861.86
[ __ ] know why I don't know why a gas

4859.52 --> 4866.120000000001
is so different from a liquid I just

4861.86 --> 4869.54
know that it does and how and what is

4866.12 --> 4872.0
the difference I don't know why okay I

4869.54 --> 4875.48
don't know why material is the way it is

4872.0 --> 4878.48
I just know how it is and what it does

4875.48 --> 4878.48
okay

4878.54 --> 4884.6
I'm not the freaking designer of all

4881.48 --> 4887.799999999999
matter in this realm I'm not that guy

4884.6 --> 4887.8
I'm not God

4888.44 --> 4892.82
at least not as far as I know but no I

4891.139 --> 4895.96
don't know I don't know why it does that

4892.82 --> 4895.96
I just know what it does

4913.76 --> 4920.9800000000005
sealed container would weigh less if

4916.82 --> 4920.98
water inside was heated into a gas

4921.679 --> 4927.08
no

4924.199 --> 4930.138999999999
but yeah a lot

4927.08 --> 4932.6
less water in the gaseous state would

4930.139 --> 4934.6990000000005
fill it so yeah the thing is about water

4932.6 --> 4938.0
when it's in a liquid form

4934.699 --> 4941.299999999999
it takes up a lot less space

4938.0 --> 4943.76
compared to the same amount separated

4941.3 --> 4947.719
heated into

4943.76 --> 4949.820000000001
moist into into gas form

4947.719 --> 4953.719
yeah

4949.82 --> 4954.86
so a lot less water would fit in a

4953.719 --> 4959.199
tanker

4954.86 --> 4959.199
if it were in water vapor state

4959.659 --> 4964.04
yeah liquid water takes up a lot more

4962.48 --> 4967.339999999999
volume

4964.04 --> 4971.54
I mean takes up a lot less volume sorry

4967.34 --> 4974.02
than water in gaseous state

4971.54 --> 4974.0199999999995
right

4976.58 --> 4981.5599999999995
so if you're just gonna put liquid water

4979.1 --> 4983.2390000000005
into a tanker and then heat it up yeah

4981.56 --> 4985.159000000001
it's just not gonna fit

4983.239 --> 4987.379999999999
either the tankers eventually just gonna

4985.159 --> 4990.44
blow up

4987.38 --> 4993.88
or yeah probably it'll just starts

4990.44 --> 4993.879999999999
squirting out out of it

4994.04 --> 4997.94
so

4995.48 --> 4999.739
yeah it's just not like oh you have the

4997.94 --> 5001.12
same amount you have a liter of water no

4999.739 --> 5003.218999999999
let's Heat this

5001.12 --> 5005.679
even though it's completely isolated and

5003.219 --> 5008.38
watch it transform into gas no it

5005.679 --> 5010.78
doesn't it can't do that unless it's

5008.38 --> 5014.26
able to actually take up more volume

5010.78 --> 5015.5199999999995
which it would in gaseous state

5014.26 --> 5018.2390000000005
right

5015.52 --> 5020.9800000000005
it's not just like a material just

5018.239 --> 5022.839999999999
transforms into another state just like

5020.98 --> 5025.65
that without any kind of volumetric

5022.84 --> 5028.689
changes that doesn't work like that

5025.65 --> 5028.688999999999
[Music]

5074.26 --> 5082.56
it's never in liquid form yep

5078.219 --> 5082.56
sure but it's not natural though

5083.32 --> 5088.599999999999
I think that it's in fluid it's like an

5086.32 --> 5089.5
in-between state so yeah I don't know

5088.6 --> 5091.780000000001
man

5089.5 --> 5094.36
I don't know George Sanford I don't know

5091.78 --> 5097.739
why it does that I just know effectively

5094.36 --> 5097.739
gas doesn't have mass

5097.9 --> 5104.159
yeah and when I say mass that

5100.719 --> 5104.159
specifically refers to

5104.34 --> 5109.9800000000005
relative density this equilibrium

5107.02 --> 5109.9800000000005
susceptibility

5113.139 --> 5117.58
and among other God just giving me a

5116.26 --> 5120.04
headache you're giving me a headache

5117.58 --> 5122.86
with that [ __ ]

5120.04 --> 5125.739
always bringing that back up I've got an

5122.86 --> 5128.679
optician tank isn't it a liquid but it

5125.739 --> 5130.98
weighs more yeah that's super [ __ ]

5128.679 --> 5130.9800000000005
cute

5132.76 --> 5139.360000000001
doesn't undo everything I stated though

5136.659 --> 5141.04
gas doesn't have mass doesn't have

5139.36 --> 5143.5
momentum

5141.04 --> 5145.719
it had momentum then it would have to

5143.5 --> 5148.48
have mass in order to retain that

5145.719 --> 5151.179
momentum it doesn't it only responds to

5148.48 --> 5153.94
pressure differential locally that's

5151.179 --> 5158.82
what gases do

5153.94 --> 5158.82
that's the only thing they do

5174.699 --> 5180.219
if you converted water inside to gas

5177.04 --> 5181.9
yeah yeah yeah you could do that RP 12

5180.219 --> 5184.06
vacation

5181.9 --> 5186.82
yeah you could do that the problem is

5184.06 --> 5190.4800000000005
though that things in gaseous State take

5186.82 --> 5194.199
up enormous amounts of space

5190.48 --> 5197.138999999999
which makes it non-efficient that's why

5194.199 --> 5200.799999999999
gas is usually well it's always

5197.139 --> 5203.08
effectively pressurized liquefied which

5200.8 --> 5205.42
is what happens I guess with oxygen it

5203.08 --> 5207.639
doesn't do that okay George stands for

5205.42 --> 5211.7390000000005
thanks for keep saying it every [ __ ]

5207.639 --> 5215.32
time super cute yeah they don't just

5211.739 --> 5218.5
transport gases in balloons

5215.32 --> 5220.179
in a normal expanded State they don't do

5218.5 --> 5222.52
that they pressurize it because it's

5220.179 --> 5226.12
extremely inefficient

5222.52 --> 5229.42
to actually have yeah to just keep gas

5226.12 --> 5231.219
and transport gas in gaseous state

5229.42 --> 5235.38
the pressurize it because then it

5231.219 --> 5235.38
doesn't take up as much freaking space

5237.58 --> 5241.0599999999995
so yeah oh it weighs less yeah but guess

5240.1 --> 5246.219
what

5241.06 --> 5249.52
in the end in Industry yeah wait

5246.219 --> 5252.28
pressure differential from matter from

5249.52 --> 5254.8
solids like on a scale right relative

5252.28 --> 5259.239
density this equilibrium pressure

5254.8 --> 5264.159000000001
is a lot less of an issue than a [ __ ]

5259.239 --> 5268.12
volume yeah volume is a lot more

5264.159 --> 5272.0199999999995
problematic in Industry than weight

5268.12 --> 5276.5199999999995
you know that's true yeah

5272.02 --> 5278.92
because something can be insanely heavy

5276.52 --> 5280.360000000001
but at least it won't take up like a

5278.92 --> 5281.4400000000005
giant Warehouse

5280.36 --> 5284.38
right

5281.44 --> 5287.08
that's why gold is so wanted because

5284.38 --> 5289.96
it's super heavy

5287.08 --> 5291.639
does take up a lot of space you can hide

5289.96 --> 5294.159
it you can keep it somewhere it's a lot

5291.639 --> 5298.5
easier to secure

5294.159 --> 5298.5
yeah this is just industrial application

5298.6 --> 5303.280000000001
things with weight

5301.0 --> 5305.56
that are heavy are a lot less

5303.28 --> 5307.0599999999995
problematic than things that take up a

5305.56 --> 5310.8
lot of volume

5307.06 --> 5310.8
that's just the way it works

5330.49 --> 5333.87
[Music]

5335.199 --> 5339.82
yeah yeah yeah George Sanford yeah I how

5338.199 --> 5342.04
do you measure that

5339.82 --> 5345.94
did you measure that on the scale did

5342.04 --> 5349.719
you did you did you measure that water

5345.94 --> 5353.4
vapor on a scale did you Jared Sanford

5349.719 --> 5356.199
or did you just [ __ ] theorize

5353.4 --> 5358.78
calculate it again and you didn't

5356.199 --> 5362.0199999999995
actually weigh anything because you

5358.78 --> 5362.0199999999995
can't ass

5365.62 --> 5373.599999999999
you can [ __ ] calculate gas weight all

5370.42 --> 5376.08
much all day long as much as you like

5373.6 --> 5377.76
yeah you can do that

5376.08 --> 5380.219
theoretically

5377.76 --> 5384.9400000000005
theoretically on paper

5380.219 --> 5388.06
calculate not actually way you don't

5384.94 --> 5391.0599999999995
actually weigh it

5388.06 --> 5394.900000000001
submit your Sanford admit it you don't

5391.06 --> 5399.280000000001
weigh gases you don't weigh gases you

5394.9 --> 5402.5199999999995
don't weigh gases you don't

5399.28 --> 5406.36
you don't do that George Sanford submit

5402.52 --> 5410.92
admit it you George Sanford have never

5406.36 --> 5414.46
put gases on a scale you have never done

5410.92 --> 5417.52
this admit it you have never done this

5414.46 --> 5420.4
yeah you can calculate all you like

5417.52 --> 5422.56
you've never actually weighed a gas

5420.4 --> 5425.379999999999
because you can't

5422.56 --> 5427.719
admit it I don't want to hear you bring

5425.38 --> 5430.12
back this stupid argument again

5427.719 --> 5432.699
admit it you haven't weighed a gas

5430.12 --> 5436.26
because you can't you can only calculate

5432.699 --> 5436.259999999999
it now submit

5443.32 --> 5446.799999999999
yeah yeah and and when did you do it

5445.239 --> 5449.0199999999995
without the tank

5446.8 --> 5451.179
yeah when did you do it without the tank

5449.02 --> 5454.120000000001
George Sanford liar

5451.179 --> 5457.139
liar without the [ __ ] tank when did

5454.12 --> 5457.139
you do it without the tank

5459.219 --> 5463.199
when did you wear gas without a tank

5481.36 --> 5486.639
you don't even know what state it is in

5483.94 --> 5489.58
when it's in there you don't know you

5486.639 --> 5492.28
don't even know if it's still a gas

5489.58 --> 5494.32
yeah you were told that oh did you see

5492.28 --> 5495.46
that for yourself how do you know that's

5494.32 --> 5497.38
even true

5495.46 --> 5499.54
because you [ __ ] read it somewhere

5497.38 --> 5502.4800000000005
Georgie

5499.54 --> 5504.34
you think you know everything

5502.48 --> 5508.239
how do you even know it's still a gas

5504.34 --> 5513.46
how do you know knowing through

5508.239 --> 5515.5
empirical testing how do you know George

5513.46 --> 5518.56
how do you even know

5515.5 --> 5520.96
just because somebody told you or it's a

5518.56 --> 5524.080000000001
consensus argument or whatever

5520.96 --> 5528.1
that oxygen when pressurized in a tank

5524.08 --> 5530.58
is still a gas how do you know that

5528.1 --> 5530.58
George

5531.34 --> 5538.3
flip it upside down no lick it oh why

5534.639 --> 5541.179
did you see it did you see it you have

5538.3 --> 5542.5
transparent gas tanks do you did you see

5541.179 --> 5545.92
it

5542.5 --> 5547.9
did you see that it's not a liquid or

5545.92 --> 5549.76
just oh it kind of feels like it and

5547.9 --> 5552.339999999999
while they're told it's like that how do

5549.76 --> 5555.280000000001
you know how do you know George you

5552.34 --> 5557.92
don't know you don't know you've been

5555.28 --> 5560.199
told you've accepted it and now you're

5557.92 --> 5563.56
being a nagging [ __ ]

5560.199 --> 5565.719
like a tick on my ass just won't leave

5563.56 --> 5569.139
me alone with your incessant whining

5565.719 --> 5572.32
about how supposedly gas has mass to try

5569.139 --> 5574.42
to destroy all of my argument which is

5572.32 --> 5576.759999999999
absolutely true my arguments are true

5574.42 --> 5578.7390000000005
gas doesn't have momentum it doesn't

5576.76 --> 5581.7390000000005
have weight

5578.739 --> 5584.08
it's not susceptible by momentum it

5581.739 --> 5586.599999999999
doesn't do that but no you and your

5584.08 --> 5589.32
[ __ ] oxygen tank again

5586.6 --> 5589.320000000001
God

5590.8 --> 5598.08
so sick of you man we always have to

5594.04 --> 5598.08
whine about your [ __ ] oxygen tank

5602.98 --> 5605.459999999999
okay

5608.82 --> 5611.938999999999
[Music]

5615.46 --> 5620.44
I can't handle this [ __ ] anymore I hate

5618.46 --> 5622.179
these people man I would have made a

5620.44 --> 5625.0599999999995
terrible teacher I'd probably beat the

5622.179 --> 5628.2390000000005
[ __ ] out of them I seriously like this

5625.06 --> 5630.580000000001
people like this man I'm so [ __ ] sick

5628.239 --> 5632.759999999999
of it

5630.58 --> 5632.76
foreign

5640.98 --> 5649.5
does not have mass

5644.199 --> 5649.5
you can't put gas on a scale

5652.06 --> 5659.76
yeah why because scales are convention

5656.02 --> 5659.76
based based on

5660.28 --> 5671.62
inside a medium of gas it doesn't work

5666.82 --> 5674.699
you can't weigh gas in its natural state

5671.62 --> 5674.699
you can't do that

5677.62 --> 5685.719
yeah that's why it's only ever

5682.06 --> 5687.52
dealt with Industrial in tanks yeah

5685.719 --> 5690.04
have you ever put gas on the scale

5687.52 --> 5692.280000000001
without a tank tell me when did you do

5690.04 --> 5692.28
that

5694.84 --> 5699.04
it's okay for people to have different

5696.639 --> 5702.04
opinions isn't it well not if they keep

5699.04 --> 5705.159
on whining incessantly about it every

5702.04 --> 5708.28
time a subject brought up no

5705.159 --> 5711.638999999999
no it's not

5708.28 --> 5714.82
it's [ __ ] annoying and it's pointless

5711.639 --> 5717.159000000001
he doesn't even have an argument

5714.82 --> 5720.639
he's just holding onto this freaking

5717.159 --> 5722.44
oxygen tank like some old fart with lung

5720.639 --> 5724.06
problems

5722.44 --> 5726.5199999999995
like

5724.06 --> 5729.719
what the [ __ ] is your deal man why do

5726.52 --> 5729.719
you keep bringing that up

5730.06 --> 5737.139
I mean you think gas has weight and so

5734.26 --> 5739.42
it has momentum and so it's a [ __ ]

5737.139 --> 5741.88
ball Earth isn't it yard Sanford it's a

5739.42 --> 5744.58
[ __ ] ball Earth isn't it you're

5741.88 --> 5748.92
secretly just holding on to a [ __ ]

5744.58 --> 5752.34
ball Earth spinning and

5748.92 --> 5755.679
it can work oh you haven't can have

5752.34 --> 5756.82
conservation of momentum of the of the

5755.679 --> 5760.179
gas and that's why we don't see

5756.82 --> 5762.58
coriola's deviation isn't it isn't it ah

5760.179 --> 5765.159
George Sanford aren't you just

5762.58 --> 5767.38
actually just about that

5765.159 --> 5770.138999999999
isn't that it

5767.38 --> 5772.8
yeah isn't that why you hang on to your

5770.139 --> 5772.8
oxygen tank

5799.42 --> 5804.52
yeah

5801.4 --> 5806.138999999999
gas bottles indeed

5804.52 --> 5808.659000000001
I mean

5806.139 --> 5809.92
just keep on holding onto that oxygen

5808.659 --> 5812.379999999999
tank

5809.92 --> 5814.179
and then the world can be a [ __ ] ball

5812.38 --> 5817.54
again George Sanford I hope you're happy

5814.179 --> 5821.02
about yourself yeah you holding on to

5817.54 --> 5823.0
that [ __ ] oxygen tank yeah you just

5821.02 --> 5825.6990000000005
enabled a whole bunch of Ballers to

5823.0 --> 5829.55
endlessly squirt again congratulations

5825.699 --> 5833.099999999999
thanks a lot man thanks a lot

5829.55 --> 5833.1
[Music]

5839.139 --> 5844.179
no Vespa Joe ass nobody's talking about

5842.44 --> 5847.299999999999
water not existing

5844.179 --> 5849.9400000000005
it just doesn't have mass

5847.3 --> 5852.28
if it's in gaseous state it doesn't have

5849.94 --> 5855.82
that doesn't work like that

5852.28 --> 5859.44
doesn't have momentum gas does not have

5855.82 --> 5862.42
momentum it only has momentum if you

5859.44 --> 5864.759999999999
mathematically theoretically theorize

5862.42 --> 5867.6990000000005
how it's little freaking balls that

5864.76 --> 5870.52
bounce against things any other yeah

5867.699 --> 5873.28
you can't demonstrate that though yeah

5870.52 --> 5876.580000000001
it's only a model

5873.28 --> 5880.86
you understand it doesn't have momentum

5876.58 --> 5880.86
that's right gas is unbonded

5899.02 --> 5901.8
foreign

5910.139 --> 5914.5
yeah yeah you know what that's called I

5912.639 --> 5918.0
already March that's called relative

5914.5 --> 5918.0
density this equilibrium

5918.04 --> 5923.86
it's temporary yeah because acts of

5921.52 --> 5926.92
fluoride that [ __ ]

5923.86 --> 5928.54
is denser

5926.92 --> 5931.9
it's denser

5928.54 --> 5933.88
than the regular gas

5931.9 --> 5937.119
that we breathe out here yeah it's

5933.88 --> 5939.639
denser so yeah for a while

5937.119 --> 5942.82
it's going to be displacing down because

5939.639 --> 5947.04
it's denser than the medium it's in

5942.82 --> 5947.04
over time though it will evaporate

5949.48 --> 5954.5199999999995
because it mixes in it eventually just

5951.76 --> 5958.06
expands in all directions

5954.52 --> 5961.38
yeah what it's not gonna do however is

5958.06 --> 5961.38
retain momentum

5965.38 --> 5968.88
yeah you can't throw it

5969.159 --> 5975.119
it's not gonna

5970.659 --> 5975.119
make an arc when you throw it

5989.02 --> 5994.5
that's right Glasgow thanks guys for

5991.3 --> 5994.5
backing me up man I'm just

5995.619 --> 5998.619
foreign

6005.06 --> 6012.7390000000005
maybe it's spring I'm just less patient

6009.119 --> 6012.739
I'm just sick of this [ __ ]

6013.56 --> 6017.76
sick of people doing the same [ __ ] over

6015.96 --> 6020.46
and over again when I make so much

6017.76 --> 6023.1
effort to try to get through I'm Mike

6020.46 --> 6026.219
I'm making so much effort guys to try

6023.1 --> 6029.2390000000005
and get through and yet people have been

6026.219 --> 6032.76
following me for years

6029.239 --> 6035.9
still do the same stupid [ __ ]

6032.76 --> 6039.0
responses I can't handle that [ __ ] yeah

6035.9 --> 6040.98
that really pisses me off

6039.0 --> 6044.48
why do you keep doing the same thing

6040.98 --> 6047.58
after years

6044.48 --> 6048.718999999999
yeah it's not like we just met in a

6047.58 --> 6050.94
month

6048.719 --> 6053.58
you've been in my chat for years and you

6050.94 --> 6057.0
keep doing the same [ __ ]

6053.58 --> 6058.8
why why do you keep doing that

6057.0 --> 6062.58
yeah

6058.8 --> 6065.400000000001
why don't you just submit to what I

6062.58 --> 6067.38
suggested to what I've explained gas

6065.4 --> 6069.36
doesn't have momentum it doesn't have

6067.38 --> 6073.1990000000005
mass

6069.36 --> 6075.179
that you persist no oxygen tank it has a

6073.199 --> 6077.04
mess I put it on the scale and it did

6075.179 --> 6079.9800000000005
registered wait

6077.04 --> 6081.6
you keep doing the same [ __ ] you don't

6079.98 --> 6083.699
even have an argument

6081.6 --> 6087.2390000000005
you don't even have an argument other

6083.699 --> 6090.119
than no you're wrong I put a gas tank on

6087.239 --> 6091.919999999999
the scale and it has weights that's it

6090.119 --> 6093.299999999999
that's all you got that's all you ever

6091.92 --> 6094.9800000000005
say

6093.3 --> 6098.179
you don't even have a follow-up

6094.98 --> 6098.178999999999
conclusion to that

6109.5 --> 6112.34
foreign

6121.679 --> 6125.88
yeah explanations are approved but

6123.659 --> 6130.4
demonstrations are and it gave plenty of

6125.88 --> 6130.400000000001
those yeah I've gave demonstrations

6131.82 --> 6138.139
I mean I've given demonstrations right

6134.28 --> 6138.139
here right here on this stream I have

6154.92 --> 6157.34
okay

6164.26 --> 6167.35
[Music]

6174.86 --> 6181.699
this video once in a lifetime yeah

6178.92 --> 6187.86
flattered early bird number

6181.699 --> 6191.94
1187 dingleberry dependency this video

6187.86 --> 6195.5599999999995
I gave demonstration in this video

6191.94 --> 6195.5599999999995
it's very basic

6196.139 --> 6204.32
it's all it needs to be because my case

6198.96 --> 6204.32
is very simple it's very simplistic

6206.58 --> 6211.619
very simple statement gas doesn't build

6209.639 --> 6214.9800000000005
momentum

6211.619 --> 6217.0199999999995
only responds to local pressure

6214.98 --> 6219.839999999999
differential and that's the only thing

6217.02 --> 6222.780000000001
it does respond to it doesn't build

6219.84 --> 6225.719
momentum you can't throw gas and then

6222.78 --> 6226.5599999999995
watch it travel an arc it doesn't do

6225.719 --> 6231.0
that

6226.56 --> 6234.0
it never does that gases never do that

6231.0 --> 6237.8
ever never ever

6234.0 --> 6237.8
because they don't have mass

6237.84 --> 6242.219
they don't

6239.58 --> 6244.5599999999995
doesn't work like that it can't build

6242.219 --> 6247.619
momentum because it doesn't have the

6244.56 --> 6250.619000000001
mass that it needs to do that

6247.619 --> 6253.38
only response to pressure differential

6250.619 --> 6256.799999999999
with all the other gases available

6253.38 --> 6258.78
within the container

6256.8 --> 6261.3
that's what it that's what it actually

6258.78 --> 6262.86
does that's my entire case for the

6261.3 --> 6264.900000000001
entire show

6262.86 --> 6266.159
there's people out here that just can't

6264.9 --> 6269.159
handle it

6266.159 --> 6271.379999999999
they just have to whine but they're

6269.159 --> 6272.699
freaking oxygen tanks and how it does

6271.38 --> 6274.9400000000005
have weight when they put it on the

6272.699 --> 6274.94
scale

6281.1 --> 6288.939
[Music]

6290.639 --> 6293.900000000001
I need a smoke break

6295.56 --> 6301.92
really haven't had anything today maybe

6297.9 --> 6303.96
that's part of why my mood's so shitty

6301.92 --> 6306.139
barely smoked anything in the last few

6303.96 --> 6306.139
days

6328.8 --> 6333.2390000000005
demonstration yeah this is a

6330.9 --> 6337.219
demonstration once in a lifetime this

6333.239 --> 6337.218999999999
see I do this

6337.32 --> 6341.82
that's the demonstration

6339.239 --> 6345.0599999999995
yeah that's me

6341.82 --> 6347.659
causing local air pressure differential

6345.06 --> 6351.06
back of my hand front of my hands

6347.659 --> 6353.759999999999
consequences and then you can literally

6351.06 --> 6355.92
do that and feel

6353.76 --> 6359.400000000001
how that works and feel that after

6355.92 --> 6361.5
you've done that it's just a second some

6359.4 --> 6364.32
and then it's neutral again why would

6361.5 --> 6367.02
that be why doesn't it just like bounce

6364.32 --> 6369.119
against the window and whatever it's all

6367.02 --> 6371.1
in motion has to go still again right

6369.119 --> 6373.86
like what would happen when you're in a

6371.1 --> 6375.900000000001
bath you start swinging your arms in the

6373.86 --> 6378.96
water yeah it's Gonna Keep moving and

6375.9 --> 6381.599999999999
it's Gonna Keep moving for a while

6378.96 --> 6384.6
maybe Splash over the side right because

6381.6 --> 6387.659000000001
it has momentum because it's water it's

6384.6 --> 6391.320000000001
a liquid and it builds momentum when you

6387.659 --> 6394.98
insert a force oh gases don't do that

6391.32 --> 6398.58
they just respond to the local pressure

6394.98 --> 6400.739
differential quickly equalize and then

6398.58 --> 6404.76
all the force is gone

6400.739 --> 6408.299999999999
because it doesn't retain momentum

6404.76 --> 6412.38
gases don't do that they don't have the

6408.3 --> 6415.26
mass in the gaseous state in order to

6412.38 --> 6416.58
retain momentum like liquids and solids

6415.26 --> 6418.26
do

6416.58 --> 6419.4
and with that I'm going to round out the

6418.26 --> 6422.639
show

6419.4 --> 6424.44
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6422.639 --> 6427.1990000000005
like this show

6424.44 --> 6430.86
it's a bit Rowdy Maybe

6427.199 --> 6433.5
but yeah it was very themed show I think

6430.86 --> 6435.78
I made my case

6433.5 --> 6437.699

6476.219 --> 6480.96
still in that

6477.9 --> 6482.46
but it definitely saved my week so I

6480.96 --> 6485.52
