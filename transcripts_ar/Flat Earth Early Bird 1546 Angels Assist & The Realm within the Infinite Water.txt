seems to be a lot more clouded now

105.0 --> 110.34
what it hasn't been rainy

108.06 --> 112.38
and yesterday was

110.34 --> 114.299
when it was a little less clouded but

112.38 --> 116.72
now it's just big clouds and they're

114.299 --> 116.72000000000001
kind of just

117.479 --> 124.74
moving by

118.82 --> 126.0
[Music]

124.74 --> 128.459
right

126.0 --> 130.2
so it's a little less cold it's less

128.459 --> 134.52
wind

130.2 --> 138.07999999999998
and no rain but still kind of Cloudy

134.52 --> 138.08
I haven't seen any sun

139.739 --> 144.8
since

141.9 --> 144.8
Sunday

145.32 --> 150.48
[Music]

147.48 --> 150.48
hmm

155.52 --> 163.8
right

156.92 --> 163.79999999999998
so it's Tuesday the 21st of March 2023

167.9 --> 172.58
the temperature is 13 degrees Celsius

174.18 --> 177.78
right

175.68 --> 181.34
it does say it's going to rain but I

177.78 --> 181.34
mean it's not happening over here

183.12 --> 185.59900000000002
all right

196.379 --> 202.79999999999998
okay I was just watching om Benjamin

199.92 --> 206.33999999999997
the hilarious

202.8 --> 208.739
show yesterday I I only caught like last

206.34 --> 211.31900000000002
part of it

208.739 --> 212.81900000000002
it's the year of discernment

211.319 --> 215.04
it's part of it I caught it actually

212.819 --> 217.14
live but I don't know it started really

215.04 --> 220.379
early for some reason

217.14 --> 222.89999999999998
or so it seems I mean according to the

220.379 --> 225.44
timer it would have started like it

222.9 --> 225.44
six

226.379 --> 232.14
whatever anyway I'm watching like the

229.799 --> 233.94
start of it back

232.14 --> 237.48
still watching that right before the

233.94 --> 240.48
show started hilarious

237.48 --> 244.26
it's got this thing going with Tyrone

240.48 --> 246.42
shoelaces it's I don't know it's really

244.26 --> 249.85999999999999
funny to me

246.42 --> 249.85999999999999
on multiple levels

251.34 --> 259.1
it's just the fourth astronaut cameraman

255.78 --> 259.1
that was left behind

263.94 --> 270.0
it I yeah it's really funny

267.54 --> 273.96000000000004
very much appreciating that from Owen

270.0 --> 273.96
Benjamin over at unauthorized.tv

275.759 --> 278.759
uh

279.919 --> 283.15999999999997
let's see

285.479 --> 290.59999999999997
yeah yesterday's fed things went wrong

290.94 --> 297.54
kiwi got in my hair in the after show

294.479 --> 301.32
and was being a real dick

297.54 --> 302.46000000000004
if any real was he really was

301.32 --> 305.4
like

302.46 --> 306.84
putting me on the spot for absolutely no

305.4 --> 308.46
reason

306.84 --> 310.919
right

308.46 --> 312.9
and yeah I left

310.919 --> 316.62
because I was just not gonna hang around

312.9 --> 318.35999999999996
he just pissed me off and everybody just

316.62 --> 321.12
let him

318.36 --> 325.52000000000004
everybody thought it was really funny

321.12 --> 325.52
so that was a real dick move and I left

325.68 --> 331.139
hey that flat fellow first to chat Dr

328.8 --> 334.02000000000004
Bass awkward

331.139 --> 336.68
Oz Richard G well you're all rolling in

334.02 --> 336.68
the same second

337.259 --> 339.74
welcome

347.039 --> 350.039
foreign

358.82 --> 362.18
My Healer

362.94 --> 367.32
and that was

364.46 --> 369.59999999999997
really interesting to me I don't know I

367.32 --> 372.539
don't know if you guys really follow

369.6 --> 375.06
that but uh yeah I am studying certain

372.539 --> 378.479
techniques

375.06 --> 380.759
and I asked him like Hey how am I like

378.479 --> 383.88
how am I doing I've been trying that out

380.759 --> 389.699
what you said me told me to do

383.88 --> 392.15999999999997
and I was really well like he he could

389.699 --> 395.40000000000003
tell apparently he does

392.16 --> 398.46000000000004
he has that ability I'd like to be as

395.4 --> 400.31899999999996
refined as he has and at that but

398.46 --> 402.18
I mean yeah it's worth the lifetime

400.319 --> 404.40000000000003
added

402.18 --> 407.28000000000003
but I might be able to attune it attain

404.4 --> 411.979
it quicker than I even thought

407.28 --> 411.979
because I apparently did really well

415.8 --> 420.479
yeah

417.18 --> 422.22
the issues why he got angry what

420.479 --> 424.8
happened was because of my own

422.22 --> 427.02000000000004
perception

424.8 --> 430.22
because I

427.02 --> 430.21999999999997
I was just like

433.08 --> 439.52
I didn't detail talk about this but I'm

435.419 --> 439.52
thinking about it now like I was

440.34 --> 445.13899999999995
still very much too much in my ethereal

443.34 --> 447.06
thinking and

445.139 --> 450.599
all that

447.06 --> 452.46
and yeah I I left for groceries during

450.599 --> 455.58
the live show and then when I came back

452.46 --> 457.13899999999995
it's like I just basically continued

455.58 --> 459.9
where I left off

457.139 --> 462.539
from the inside because I really like

459.9 --> 465.96
just the esoteric

462.539 --> 468.36
and psychology deep diving and like

465.96 --> 470.88
fractally connecting it as I explained

468.36 --> 473.819
it I like doing that well apparently

470.88 --> 476.52
over at Nathan's they don't really like

473.819 --> 479.96000000000004
it when I do that especially John and

476.52 --> 479.96
the rest doesn't seem to give a [ __ ]

482.039 --> 489.259
right

484.099 --> 489.259
and well there's other factors too

490.8 --> 496.979
but I can actually do something about it

494.759 --> 499.199
and I first tried it

496.979 --> 503.58
well for my show

499.199 --> 505.68
because apparently you can just do it

503.58 --> 508.74
with others

505.68 --> 511.68
and now there are exemptions when it it

508.74 --> 514.64
can't work but apparently even I could

511.68 --> 514.64
just basically

514.68 --> 520.3199999999999
set a ground

517.32 --> 522.839
and I did like everybody that's going to

520.32 --> 525.86
enter this chat

522.839 --> 528.9590000000001
is going to have basically the Angels

525.86 --> 531.779
restore their Spirit body

528.959 --> 534.42
like that is just going to happen

531.779 --> 537.0
because I asked for it

534.42 --> 540.3
and that works

537.0 --> 542.519
and I'm really curious well everybody

540.3 --> 545.4799999999999
that rolled in seems to be feeling great

542.519 --> 545.48
don't they so

546.36 --> 550.58
I'm not getting any weird vibes

554.04 --> 558.18
okay

555.29 --> 561.18
[Music]

558.18 --> 563.8389999999999
who did I ask the angels

561.18 --> 563.8389999999999
Christ

571.04 --> 575.42
okay well that's good for you

575.459 --> 583.3389999999999
I I do know where my house lives

580.74 --> 583.339
okay

584.64 --> 588.6
now

586.62 --> 591.0
all right now of course for certain

588.6 --> 594.6
troll Figures it's not gonna work

591.0 --> 597.26
because again there's exemptions yeah

594.6 --> 599.82
you can't bore somebody that's like

597.26 --> 604.7
gleefully surrendering themselves to

599.82 --> 604.7
demonic Behavior you can't do it to them

606.66 --> 613.5799999999999
right just like you can't get through

609.36 --> 613.58
verbally to a person like that

613.68 --> 619.92
so

616.08 --> 620.88
but I mean yeah if you're not demonic

619.92 --> 625.56
like that

620.88 --> 628.8
then and even up to a certain degree if

625.56 --> 630.54
you are by accident you just woke up

628.8 --> 633.06
with the wrong side of your bed and it's

630.54 --> 635.519
like oh everything sucks and no I don't

633.06 --> 637.8199999999999
like iron today then it might even still

635.519 --> 637.82
work

640.26 --> 646.019
so yeah I I tried it see what's gonna

643.98 --> 649.14
happen with the rest of the show

646.019 --> 652.74
and I might even apply this to certain

649.14 --> 652.74
other individuals

653.64 --> 659.48
I was actually encouraged by my healer

656.16 --> 659.48
to do that literally

661.26 --> 667.9399999999999
because when it comes to like weird

664.38 --> 671.04
ethereal Powers which are definitely

667.94 --> 672.6
measurable powers to me like yeah I

671.04 --> 675.06
can't prove it scientifically well go

672.6 --> 677.22
[ __ ] yourself I don't give a [ __ ] if I

675.06 --> 679.6199999999999
can't scientifically prove it I don't

677.22 --> 682.5
give a [ __ ] about science I'm building

679.62 --> 685.2
Powers yeah I probably can't prove my

682.5 --> 687.899
magnetization scientifically either I

685.2 --> 689.6400000000001
don't give a [ __ ] you know why because

687.899 --> 691.14
it works

689.64 --> 695.06
laughs

691.14 --> 695.06
it works very well

696.72 --> 702.9200000000001
right so I'm going to keep developing

699.72 --> 702.9200000000001
these powers

702.959 --> 709.26
which are to me very tangible Powers

705.959 --> 711.26
they work on me

709.26 --> 714.66
and well

711.26 --> 718.079
they work on others too if somebody else

714.66 --> 720.8389999999999
can do it on me and it works like over a

718.079 --> 724.079
freaking distance on the phone well that

720.839 --> 726.9590000000001
means that I can also learn to do it and

724.079 --> 729.2399999999999
apparently even the preliminary startups

726.959 --> 732.3
of trying to apply to myself have worked

729.24 --> 736.6800000000001
extremely well

732.3 --> 739.8599999999999
as in almost perfect yeah and that's

736.68 --> 742.079
just one freaking week of a first go

739.86 --> 746.5790000000001
attempt

742.079 --> 747.4799999999999
so yeah I've got things to do and

746.579 --> 750.12
develop

747.48 --> 751.6800000000001
I'm Gonna Be A Healer I'm going to be

750.12 --> 753.9590000000001
like my healer

751.68 --> 756.92
I've made up my mind I can do this I

753.959 --> 756.92
have the talent for it

757.079 --> 761.88
in my mind oh I would have to do it for

759.66 --> 764.12
like another 20 years yeah well guess

761.88 --> 764.12
what

764.76 --> 772.8
that assessment may just simply be wrong

769.079 --> 776.459
I might be very capable of doing it on a

772.8 --> 778.92
high level really quickly

776.459 --> 780.4799999999999
if I can just accept

778.92 --> 783.74
yeah

780.48 --> 783.74
that I can do that

787.32 --> 792.24
I should do my background but my bank

789.42 --> 795.5999999999999
account doesn't have a soul and a spirit

792.24 --> 799.2
and an ether body in order to be put

795.6 --> 801.899
back in its rightful vessel

799.2 --> 804.6
so no my bank account cannot be healed

801.899 --> 807.079
that doesn't work that way

804.6 --> 807.0790000000001
right

807.48 --> 814.4590000000001
but you could heal my bank account

811.139 --> 814.4590000000001
and then I could heal you

816.36 --> 819.32
how about that

821.339 --> 825.1800000000001
all right because the funny freaking

823.62 --> 826.62
thing is

825.18 --> 829.38
technically

826.62 --> 831.18
if I pull through this and fend off the

829.38 --> 832.74
demons that are not gonna like this

831.18 --> 834.959
they're already screaming at me right

832.74 --> 837.66
now from the chat

834.959 --> 841.3199999999999
right they don't like it it's like oh

837.66 --> 845.24
the light is making Headway they hate it

841.32 --> 848.0400000000001
they are like tearing their skin open

845.24 --> 851.16
with anguish in the face

848.04 --> 853.04
of a serious light worker developing

851.16 --> 856.1999999999999
Powers rapidly

853.04 --> 858.8389999999999
they're scared as [ __ ]

856.2 --> 862.94
because this is a real power that's

858.839 --> 862.94
palpable through the dimensions

865.019 --> 870.48
and I don't give a [ __ ] if I can't

867.959 --> 872.64
scientifically prove it I don't give a

870.48 --> 874.6800000000001
[ __ ] dude

872.64 --> 876.72
[Music]

874.68 --> 880.079
because it works

876.72 --> 882.74
that's all I give a [ __ ] about

880.079 --> 882.7399999999999
ah

884.76 --> 887.9399999999999
if I was intelligent I would not have

886.5 --> 891.139
anything in the back yeah well I don't

887.94 --> 891.139
really have a lot in my bank

894.0 --> 898.38
right I mean if you're gonna have like

896.1 --> 900.779
what is it over 10 000 Euros or

898.38 --> 905.779
something in the bank

900.779 --> 905.779
they're gonna try to rip it from you

905.94 --> 911.2790000000001
like literally warnings are going around

908.82 --> 913.019
in emails about Bank Insurance like oh

911.279 --> 913.98
you're you're a depositors insured

913.019 --> 916.62
really

913.98 --> 917.76
but be careful if it's more

916.62 --> 922.16
like

917.76 --> 922.16
yeah so you're right enjoyed Sanford

923.579 --> 930.68
what sort of illness can I heal

927.24 --> 934.199
well it's not the illness

930.68 --> 935.2199999999999
it's the state of the spirit what I can

934.199 --> 937.459
do

935.22 --> 941.22
is

937.459 --> 944.06
re-enable your body from being able to

941.22 --> 944.0600000000001
heal itself

947.88 --> 952.139
right

948.959 --> 955.26
so it's not like oh you got a disease

952.139 --> 957.899
and then and it's like oh it just

955.26 --> 961.079
disappears no no no

957.899 --> 963.66
because Jesus are

961.079 --> 966.3
the reaction

963.66 --> 969.7199999999999
of the action if you take away the

966.3 --> 971.699
action yeah the reaction might still

969.72 --> 974.22
Linger on for a bit you're still gonna

971.699 --> 976.3199999999999
have the the processes that were part of

974.22 --> 978.779
that in your body

976.32 --> 982.519
but

978.779 --> 982.519
you might heal it up quicker

984.24 --> 990.019
right so yeah this is not

987.42 --> 993.0
this is not like medical

990.019 --> 995.579
allopathic procedural thinking at all

993.0 --> 997.5
this is about spirits

995.579 --> 1001.3
this is about German new medicine this

997.5 --> 1001.3
is about Rudolph Steiner Legacy

1002.019 --> 1005.68
Spirit mechanics

1007.82 --> 1012.4590000000001
and it works

1009.98 --> 1012.4590000000001
right

1014.24 --> 1018.5
but

1015.62 --> 1021.68
it's not something that I'm gonna talk

1018.5 --> 1023.54
about like the entire show because

1021.68 --> 1028.8799999999999
yeah I mean it's very interesting and

1023.54 --> 1033.02
all that but the point is is to test it

1028.88 --> 1035.5400000000002
to test it I'll have to well just talk

1033.02 --> 1038.679
about the regular stuff

1035.54 --> 1038.6789999999999
and see what happens

1039.26 --> 1041.98
huh

1043.16 --> 1050.96
science things no no that's not true DR

1046.52 --> 1054.5
Boss that's awkward that's a straw man

1050.96 --> 1057.1000000000001
science is not sentient and it's not

1054.5 --> 1057.1
scientific

1059.96 --> 1064.179
not

1061.52 --> 1068.78
you're talking about the science

1064.179 --> 1072.679
atheists Satanic science culture God

1068.78 --> 1074.84
denying science atheist culture

1072.679 --> 1076.3600000000001
yeah they believe a lot of really

1074.84 --> 1079.6399999999999
ridiculous

1076.36 --> 1081.86
illogical things they insist to break

1079.64 --> 1084.6200000000001
logic itself

1081.86 --> 1086.12
right because logic too was invented by

1084.62 --> 1088.3999999999999
God

1086.12 --> 1090.9189999999999
and they insist that we don't need it we

1088.4 --> 1094.52
don't need God we don't need logic

1090.919 --> 1097.7
delusion is better than reality

1094.52 --> 1101.559
that's the motto of science

1097.7 --> 1101.559
the satanic atheist

1102.32 --> 1105.32
culture

1111.62 --> 1115.299
hey LSG good to see you

1115.4 --> 1118.459
[Music]

1125.0 --> 1129.98
yeah hey dude

1126.86 --> 1133.6
piss off whoever the [ __ ] you are get

1129.98 --> 1133.6
the [ __ ] out of here scumbag

1140.799 --> 1144.34
just go [ __ ] yourself

1144.44 --> 1146.6200000000001
foreign

1148.2 --> 1151.269
[Music]

1155.71 --> 1158.819
[Music]

1168.1 --> 1174.1699999999998
sex wow a lot of people in here

1170.97 --> 1174.17
[Music]

1185.24 --> 1189.6200000000001
how do I reach spirits well I don't

1188.059 --> 1192.559
reach spirits

1189.62 --> 1194.12
yeah you don't see this involves Spirit

1192.559 --> 1198.3999999999999
mechanics

1194.12 --> 1198.3999999999999
but I'm not the one doing it

1198.62 --> 1205.34
it's the angels that are doing it as

1201.74 --> 1209.559
they were designated to

1205.34 --> 1209.559
this is a realm power

1210.02 --> 1217.34
that basically every human has the right

1213.919 --> 1220.46
like karmically spiritually the right to

1217.34 --> 1222.1399999999999
use that but you gotta do it that's the

1220.46 --> 1224.9
point

1222.14 --> 1226.13
right it's all about just getting back

1224.9 --> 1227.8600000000001
to yourself

1226.13 --> 1231.98
[Music]

1227.86 --> 1235.36
and you can be like kind of miraculously

1231.98 --> 1235.3600000000001
assisted in that

1235.64 --> 1241.48
the problem is that people they don't

1238.28 --> 1244.46
they always anthropomorphize everything

1241.48 --> 1247.46
even with the angels and God and all

1244.46 --> 1250.94
that and so they end up distracted

1247.46 --> 1254.299
wanting some material or more in the

1250.94 --> 1256.72
direction of material things

1254.299 --> 1261.1399999999999
when they when they pray or whatever

1256.72 --> 1263.96
instead of just a purely non-material

1261.14 --> 1265.96
spiritual function

1263.96 --> 1269.66
which is very

1265.96 --> 1270.6200000000001
non-societal like people don't even do

1269.66 --> 1272.539
that

1270.62 --> 1277.6999999999998
anymore

1272.539 --> 1280.28
we're all so stuck in the mud in the in

1277.7 --> 1281.8400000000001
the substance of physical reality and

1280.28 --> 1284.66
and the demons and everything they put

1281.84 --> 1287.559
in our faces all

1284.66 --> 1291.28
to distract away from the original

1287.559 --> 1291.28
positions of our spirit

1291.74 --> 1300.14
assistant to God yes

1295.52 --> 1303.58
no not God God doesn't manifest

1300.14 --> 1303.5800000000002
Angels do everything

1308.6 --> 1312.9189999999999
yeah even if you're really insisting

1310.88 --> 1314.96
that you're communicating with God it's

1312.919 --> 1316.94
Metatron

1314.96 --> 1321.4
God

1316.94 --> 1321.4
doesn't have a personification

1323.179 --> 1326.26
it just is

1329.36 --> 1334.6399999999999
yeah the angels

1331.9 --> 1337.539
are his fingers

1334.64 --> 1337.539
his hands

1345.52 --> 1351.28
each row one gives a [ __ ] what they want

1348.919 --> 1351.2800000000002
dude

1358.24 --> 1363.039
[Music]

1360.5 --> 1363.039
foreign

1369.26 --> 1374.84
so no it's not

1372.14 --> 1376.159
a personification of God that does

1374.84 --> 1377.539
anything

1376.159 --> 1380.2990000000002
there's the

1377.539 --> 1381.559
there's the Christ spirit

1380.299 --> 1384.94
yeah

1381.559 --> 1384.94
and there's the angels

1385.159 --> 1388.5800000000002
they're all

1387.14 --> 1392.44
there

1388.58 --> 1392.4399999999998
from God for us

1393.74 --> 1399.88
in the spirit realm continually

1396.919 --> 1399.88
and forever

1400.22 --> 1407.059
like they don't go away they cannot be

1403.64 --> 1409.1000000000001
stopped or halted or even slowed down in

1407.059 --> 1410.6589999999999
what they do they're just there

1409.1 --> 1412.6999999999998
available

1410.659 --> 1416.0590000000002
the only way

1412.7 --> 1420.98
the situation could fail and it won't is

1416.059 --> 1425.6789999999999
if people just stay too distracted with

1420.98 --> 1425.679
just nonsense in the dirt

1427.1 --> 1430.6999999999998
if you don't

1428.48 --> 1433.1
think it could work anymore because

1430.7 --> 1436.52
you're just too preoccupied with your

1433.1 --> 1439.039
dirt right in front of your nose

1436.52 --> 1441.22
that's the only way it could feel but it

1439.039 --> 1441.22
won't

1445.059 --> 1451.46
these powers

1447.86 --> 1454.12
these powers that are destined to

1451.46 --> 1454.1200000000001
humanity

1454.28 --> 1460.34
it was set up for humans it always has

1457.82 --> 1462.799
been since the start

1460.34 --> 1467.4189999999999
and it's now

1462.799 --> 1469.76
the time for it for for us to regain

1467.419 --> 1471.94
that connection for those that seek it

1469.76 --> 1471.94
out

1476.1 --> 1480.6499999999999
[Music]

1492.38 --> 1495.1000000000001
hmm

1495.2 --> 1499.24
they said this they don't do anything

1502.48 --> 1508.1
I get it caught up in the dirt George

1505.159 --> 1511.0390000000002
this is exactly what I'm talking about

1508.1 --> 1512.78
you're just staring at the dirt right in

1511.039 --> 1515.48
front of you

1512.78 --> 1518.0
yeah like oh that's more important what

1515.48 --> 1522.46
the dirt is more important oh this

1518.0 --> 1522.46
physical contemporary situation

1525.94 --> 1529.8400000000001
dirt is not important

1531.86 --> 1535.36
dirt comes and goes

1538.46 --> 1543.3
yeah and you don't have to talk about

1541.1 --> 1546.369
Jesus

1543.3 --> 1546.369
[Music]

1551.419 --> 1557.539
I mean there's a lot to learn from it

1553.82 --> 1560.84
right it's very key figure

1557.539 --> 1565.1589999999999
even in connecting us to

1560.84 --> 1567.34
the angels like re-connecting you could

1565.159 --> 1567.3400000000001
say

1569.6 --> 1574.82
but that doesn't mean that oh well you

1572.419 --> 1577.64
don't go to heaven if you don't talk to

1574.82 --> 1579.799
about Jesus to people that's just

1577.64 --> 1582.6200000000001
complete horseshit

1579.799 --> 1584.179
that's called a church-based Ponzi

1582.62 --> 1588.6399999999999
scheme

1584.179 --> 1588.64
and every freaking kid knows it

1592.88 --> 1595.88
right

1600.61 --> 1606.1999999999998
[Music]

1602.24 --> 1609.14
so yeah I'm sure that it Israel wants

1606.2 --> 1612.44
everybody to not use the word Jesus

1609.14 --> 1615.679
anymore to just forget about it right

1612.44 --> 1618.159
in the hopes that just by not being able

1615.679 --> 1621.26
to blabber on about it all day long

1618.159 --> 1622.94
they'll completely lose it and those

1621.26 --> 1624.74
people might be right there might be

1622.94 --> 1628.4
people out there that just have to

1624.74 --> 1632.179
blabber on about Jesus Christ like every

1628.4 --> 1634.3400000000001
15 minutes or they'll turn into Satan

1632.179 --> 1636.679
I don't [ __ ] know man what type of

1634.34 --> 1638.6589999999999
people are out there that are doing that

1636.679 --> 1641.299
that some of them are really haunted

1638.659 --> 1644.0
like that and they have to like keep

1641.299 --> 1645.62
doing it or they'll go insane or

1644.0 --> 1648.159
something

1645.62 --> 1648.1589999999999
but

1648.26 --> 1650.86
yeah

1651.94 --> 1657.1000000000001
that's all people caught up with their

1654.559 --> 1657.1
own demons

1670.34 --> 1673.059
go ahead

1674.32 --> 1679.24
what are you talking about LSD what show

1679.82 --> 1683.02
that's pretty cool what

1685.58 --> 1689.539
what's my thoughts on the Napoleon

1687.38 --> 1691.94
angels and the nephilims

1689.539 --> 1694.72
uh

1691.94 --> 1694.72
overrated

1697.22 --> 1703.22
I mean yeah they were Angels they had a

1700.7 --> 1704.24
function just like the angels and they

1703.22 --> 1709.3600000000001
broke

1704.24 --> 1709.36
and so they became dwelling spirits

1712.94 --> 1716.659
and

1714.44 --> 1718.88
yeah I don't really like it's not really

1716.659 --> 1722.1200000000001
even directly connected to the Laura

1718.88 --> 1725.0590000000002
although that I've gotten so far

1722.12 --> 1726.3799999999999
like we don't talk about that like I

1725.059 --> 1729.7
talk about

1726.38 --> 1733.2990000000002
Lucifer and aryaman as in an influence

1729.7 --> 1737.179
and arguably

1733.299 --> 1740.059
Spirits actual entities that basically

1737.179 --> 1742.159
hop into people and do their thing

1740.059 --> 1744.3799999999999
without the person's Consciousness

1742.159 --> 1748.5800000000002
really being in on it

1744.38 --> 1751.1200000000001
they might think it's them it isn't

1748.58 --> 1751.12
so

1751.82 --> 1756.3799999999999
right yeah there might have been an

1753.919 --> 1760.64
angel spirit that was just originally

1756.38 --> 1766.0
part of the plan of the setup that

1760.64 --> 1766.0
went rogue and started possessing people

1781.059 --> 1787.72
right but as for the Nephilim

1784.94 --> 1787.72
I don't know

1788.299 --> 1794.1399999999999
like in this specific framework it's

1791.539 --> 1797.6
like I don't really know

1794.14 --> 1799.3990000000001
the Nephilim is like a very specifically

1797.6 --> 1802.1789999999999
biblical

1799.399 --> 1802.1789999999999
concept

1806.179 --> 1810.3400000000001
I mean it's like a physical claim

1816.44 --> 1821.14
interesting and very fascinating and I

1818.779 --> 1825.74
mean oh look at all the the fantasy and

1821.14 --> 1828.0200000000002
ideas that has come out of that concept

1825.74 --> 1830.419
it's like some ultimate mysterious Arch

1828.02 --> 1832.279
Enemy with the infantible powers or

1830.419 --> 1834.26
whatever yeah yeah that pretty much all

1832.279 --> 1836.299
comes from the freaking Nephilim and all

1834.26 --> 1839.919
that and

1836.299 --> 1839.9189999999999
and the Fallen Angels

1843.14 --> 1848.659
and yeah they might be dark Spirits

1846.679 --> 1851.0590000000002
indeed that are just like well they're

1848.659 --> 1853.3400000000001
not living anymore and so they're just

1851.059 --> 1855.799
caught

1853.34 --> 1857.6
they are caught in the negative

1855.799 --> 1860.179
energy

1857.6 --> 1862.1589999999999
and they can't get out

1860.179 --> 1865.039
something like that

1862.159 --> 1869.0590000000002
so they can only reach out to things and

1865.039 --> 1870.62
spirits that dwell on that frequency

1869.059 --> 1872.1789999999999
that's where they get to you that's

1870.62 --> 1874.82
where they start to try to make deals

1872.179 --> 1878.919
with you right try to get inside of you

1874.82 --> 1878.9189999999999
so they can live again through you

1885.86 --> 1893.7199999999998
right I mean it's like fall angels like

1889.7 --> 1895.3990000000001
they're just like ah man no yeah it

1893.72 --> 1898.22
might be a little negative but I mean

1895.399 --> 1901.279
I'm pretty cool and I just want to ride

1898.22 --> 1903.5
man just wanna ride come on let me let

1901.279 --> 1905.179
me get in your head for a second I just

1903.5 --> 1908.24
wanna ride

1905.179 --> 1910.1000000000001
just want to see the sights come on one

1908.24 --> 1912.64
harp gonna do

1910.1 --> 1912.6399999999999
right

1913.88 --> 1917.2
that's kind of what they're like

1927.98 --> 1933.159
no I did not get that freaking show a

1930.919 --> 1933.159
try

1935.8 --> 1947.899
[Music]

1939.98 --> 1949.58
just no no no no no no is that happy no

1947.899 --> 1953.5
it sucks

1949.58 --> 1953.5
the whole preface about it sucks

1953.659 --> 1958.48
it's all just more stupid physical

1955.76 --> 1958.48
nonsense

2002.26 --> 2008.86
entrepromorphization

nobody is perfectly immune

she can be very guarded

2040.899 --> 2045.6999999999998
can't be immune

yeah as soon as your effort your focus

2045.7 --> 2049.48
stops

2047.08 --> 2051.8199999999997
right back you're right back at the

the only thing that does it is

2078.54 --> 2084.7
you doing that the rest of your life

2109.24 --> 2113.3799999999997
people slip up all the time

2111.52 --> 2115.42
I mean all the time they don't even

2113.38 --> 2117.52
realize it when they slip up that's part

2115.42 --> 2119.7400000000002
of typical slip off with Lucifer you

2117.52 --> 2121.66
just start doing something like you're

2119.74 --> 2123.3999999999996
just like yeah I've always done that not

2121.66 --> 2125.2599999999998
realizing that you haven't always done

2123.4 --> 2128.2200000000003
that and that you're actually falling

2125.26 --> 2128.2200000000003
back in some habit

2128.68 --> 2132.359
getting back on the wrong track

2132.88 --> 2139.1800000000003
yeah you know nobody's really immune

2136.079 --> 2142.0
mostly when people truly think like oh

2139.18 --> 2144.3999999999996
I'm I'm finally free

2142.0 --> 2146.2
I'm finally where I need to be yeah well

2144.4 --> 2148.54
as soon as you think that you're gonna

2146.2 --> 2153.48
make a wrong move

2148.54 --> 2153.48
it's like you're asking for it then

2158.14 --> 2163.02
but anyway yeah skeptic you are doing

2160.48 --> 2163.02
great though

2163.66 --> 2165.8999999999996
foreign

2166.78 --> 2173.1600000000003
just try to not be over courageous

2169.78 --> 2173.1600000000003
there's always more

2173.8 --> 2177.03
[Music]

2187.839 --> 2193.0789999999997
this is ridiculous beautiful nightmare

2193.24 --> 2195.839
like

2213.46 --> 2216.0
hmm

2217.18 --> 2221.7
right okay skeptic that's awesome

2224.98 --> 2228.66
that yeah that's the way to do it

2229.54 --> 2234.599
all right

2231.099 --> 2238.48
that I'm not entirely done yet though

2234.599 --> 2241.7400000000002
wow and still cannabis tobacco

2238.48 --> 2241.7400000000002
it's still an issue

2246.7 --> 2252.22
but yeah when it comes to everything

2249.28 --> 2254.26
else yeah I definitely got the alcohol

2252.22 --> 2256.54
completely

2254.26 --> 2258.46
is gone

2256.54 --> 2261.16
and

2258.46 --> 2263.44
tea coffee although

2261.16 --> 2266.5
recently I've been kind of longing for

2263.44 --> 2269.02
coffee again that's weird

2266.5 --> 2272.38
like out of nowhere it's like ah

2269.02 --> 2275.88
I wish I had a cup of coffee

2272.38 --> 2275.88
that's kind of unexpected

2276.099 --> 2282.9
I might try it but there's a good chance

2280.42 --> 2286.619
I'll be very sorry when I do

2282.9 --> 2286.619
I'm not sure yet

2287.38 --> 2291.7000000000003
I'll probably get really hyped from it

2289.48 --> 2294.04
because it's been completely deprived of

2291.7 --> 2297.24
all forms of caffeine

2294.04 --> 2297.24
yeah for months now

2298.119 --> 2301.6600000000003
you don't consider that a drug

2301.14 --> 2302.98
[Music]

2301.66 --> 2307.68
um

2302.98 --> 2307.68
that's very cute it is though

2311.56 --> 2319.24
I mean it's a pretty cool drug

2315.579 --> 2323.5600000000004
compared to all the others

2319.24 --> 2327.7599999999998
but I mean it is effectively one so

2323.56 --> 2330.7599999999998
I mean t like

2327.76 --> 2335.6800000000003
from the actual tea plant

2330.76 --> 2338.8590000000004
is a drug coffee is a drug

2335.68 --> 2341.5
they are drugs you can think of them as

2338.859 --> 2345.96
like nah they're not drugs but they are

2341.5 --> 2349.18
drugs sugar is a drug

2345.96 --> 2352.18
very much so

2349.18 --> 2354.04
they are drugs you can think of them a

2352.18 --> 2357.359
lot it's not drug but they are though

2354.04 --> 2357.359
they really are

2359.44 --> 2366.099
compared to meth yeah well meth is just

2362.52 --> 2367.48
extremely terrible for your body and

2366.099 --> 2371.6400000000003
spirit

2367.48 --> 2371.64
right so that's a terrible drug

2371.859 --> 2377.98
but just because math is so extreme and

2375.22 --> 2380.98
artificial and does all that [ __ ] to you

2377.98 --> 2383.98
does it mean that sugar

2380.98 --> 2388.599
and caffeine

2383.98 --> 2391.78
and cannabis are not drugs yes they are

2388.599 --> 2393.82
just not so incredibly terrible on your

2391.78 --> 2397.6800000000003
body although dude if you really overdo

2393.82 --> 2397.6800000000003
the caffeine that's gonna [ __ ] you up

2398.619 --> 2407.76
right and sugar could literally kill you

2403.14 --> 2407.7599999999998
so all depends

2409.92 --> 2415.859
division yes well there is that

2413.32 --> 2415.8590000000004
right

2419.68 --> 2426.2999999999997
but I mean that kind of implies rather

2422.98 --> 2426.3
that we should eat it though

2431.28 --> 2437.02
[Music]

2433.119 --> 2440.28
right I mean if you take

2437.02 --> 2440.28
cannabinoid oil

2440.619 --> 2445.02
then that's not taking a drug

2446.02 --> 2449.88
that's literally a food supplement

2450.04 --> 2457.42
or medicine if you will right but if you

2453.94 --> 2461.2000000000003
smoke like I do well that's a drug

2457.42 --> 2463.32
it has like tangible influences like a

2461.2 --> 2463.3199999999997
drug

2463.839 --> 2468.2799999999997
yeah my math will crush your soul that's

2466.06 --> 2471.7599999999998
right Matthew just [ __ ] you up right so

2468.28 --> 2475.3590000000004
I did never try that like ever don't do

2471.76 --> 2478.0
that it's really bad like I never ever

2475.359 --> 2480.5789999999997
in any any moment

2478.0 --> 2482.68
thought like well yeah maybe it's a good

2480.579 --> 2486.52
idea if you do that no it's never good

2482.68 --> 2489.64
it's always gonna lead to trouble always

2486.52 --> 2492.46
nobody's that's ever like continually

2489.64 --> 2494.74
tried that ended up great

2492.46 --> 2496.78
nobody

2494.74 --> 2499.359
it'll wreck your life even if you're

2496.78 --> 2501.2200000000003
using it to for your profession or

2499.359 --> 2502.06
whatever to stay awake it's gonna [ __ ]

2501.22 --> 2504.72
you up

2502.06 --> 2504.72
it will

2505.3 --> 2507.7200000000003
right

2514.24 --> 2520.18
right just like yeah the uh

2518.38 --> 2523.3
is it

2520.18 --> 2526.1189999999997
just like heroin and

2523.3 --> 2529.1800000000003
and those types of pain killing drugs

2526.119 --> 2531.6600000000003
they also like provably [ __ ] you up they

2529.18 --> 2531.66
always will

2539.38 --> 2542.82
drug is in neutral term

2542.92 --> 2547.78
for some bird and goo drugs yeah but

2545.32 --> 2549.52
that's why I use the word medicine

2547.78 --> 2551.7400000000002
specifically

2549.52 --> 2552.82
when there is literally no negative side

2551.74 --> 2554.859
effects

2552.82 --> 2556.839
I mean there is no negative side effect

2554.859 --> 2558.52
from taking

2556.839 --> 2560.02
CBD oil

2558.52 --> 2563.859
there's none

2560.02 --> 2565.78
never has never been a single registry

2563.859 --> 2568.54
of a negative side effect from taking

2565.78 --> 2571.6600000000003
that ever

2568.54 --> 2573.4
or if there is I'd like to know about it

2571.66 --> 2575.859
cause I never heard that I mean maybe if

2573.4 --> 2578.7400000000002
you're in like all kinds of like cell

2575.859 --> 2580.24
mutating drugs pharmaceutical drugs and

2578.74 --> 2583.1189999999997
then you take it and then it'll suddenly

2580.24 --> 2584.56
[ __ ] you up yeah I'm sure but that might

2583.119 --> 2586.7200000000003
just be

2584.56 --> 2588.22
the drop that made the buckets spill

2586.72 --> 2591.5789999999997
then because you're already [ __ ] up

2588.22 --> 2593.56
right I mean it on itself never has a

2591.579 --> 2596.92
negative side effect

2593.56 --> 2600.16
right that's psychological nothing

2596.92 --> 2603.52
oh when I smoke a joint and I don't feel

2600.16 --> 2605.98
good it can make it worse

2603.52 --> 2608.859
so then it's not just medicine it can

2605.98 --> 2612.42
also be wrong it can also

2608.859 --> 2612.42
get in your own way with it

2637.18 --> 2642.54
it got carried out of a cafe

2640.0 --> 2642.54
[ __ ]

2643.42 --> 2647.859
oh you got some really heavy uh cannabis

2646.18 --> 2650.44
sauce

2647.859 --> 2652.119
or you got to be careful though with it

2650.44 --> 2655.06
especially if you're not used to it man

2652.119 --> 2658.78
cannabis can really if you smoke it can

2655.06 --> 2662.319
really yeah if you've like never done it

2658.78 --> 2664.3
it can really like sneak up on you

2662.319 --> 2666.04
I mean I've had some experiences too

2664.3 --> 2669.1800000000003
when I was younger and like starting out

2666.04 --> 2669.18
with it that was crazy

2669.76 --> 2676.7200000000003
like where I almost fainted from it

2674.14 --> 2679.0789999999997
because the impact was so unexpectedly

2676.72 --> 2679.0789999999997
strong

2682.119 --> 2685.119
ah

2685.66 --> 2689.2599999999998
right and that by the way does come back

2688.0 --> 2691.24
I mean

2689.26 --> 2694.2400000000002
if I

2691.24 --> 2697.66
like stop smoking it doesn't take long

2694.24 --> 2699.52
for me to to become really sensitive to

2697.66 --> 2701.6189999999997
it again

2699.52 --> 2703.9
and that's really annoying because I

2701.619 --> 2706.48
don't like that I don't like getting

2703.9 --> 2708.28
overwhelmed by it I don't like that at

2706.48 --> 2710.92
all it's really disruptive

2708.28 --> 2713.8590000000004
it's disruptive to my spirit even so if

2710.92 --> 2716.38
I just smoke a little bit

2713.859 --> 2719.68
continually I'm not literally continue

2716.38 --> 2722.38
not chain smoking but just

2719.68 --> 2725.14
like no more than eight hours in between

2722.38 --> 2727.119
then I don't get to that point where

2725.14 --> 2729.52
it's just gonna hit me like a freaking

2727.119 --> 2731.28
Hammer again because I don't like it

2729.52 --> 2735.96
when that happens

2731.28 --> 2735.96
it's very disruptive to me

2743.68 --> 2747.46
hey Steph Moretz

2745.78 --> 2749.7400000000002
good to see you man

2747.46 --> 2752.5
what are we talking about yeah we're

2749.74 --> 2755.02
talking about drugs again now for some

2752.5 --> 2757.5
freaking reason

2755.02 --> 2760.119
but I was actually referencing to well

2757.5 --> 2762.22
techniques from my healer and that I'm

2760.119 --> 2765.1600000000003
trying them out and that they seem to be

2762.22 --> 2767.98
working really bizarrely well

2765.16 --> 2770.6189999999997
like it's it's kind of freaking me out

2767.98 --> 2773.68
to me it almost feels like I discovered

2770.619 --> 2775.359
this high power and it's just like wait

2773.68 --> 2777.46
I could just use that

2775.359 --> 2779.0789999999997
really

2777.46 --> 2783.46
just allowed

2779.079 --> 2787.42
what like and like allowance even like

2783.46 --> 2790.119
good like that it's freaky it's kind of

2787.42 --> 2791.26
freaky I had similar experience by the

2790.119 --> 2793.7200000000003
way when I first discovered

2791.26 --> 2796.6800000000003
mechanization it was like

2793.72 --> 2796.68
is this real

2797.8 --> 2802.98
nah

2799.839 --> 2802.98
nah that's crazy

2804.52 --> 2812.339
so I'm kind of like in unbelief still

2807.22 --> 2812.339
about it because I I've just been

2813.06 --> 2818.98
confirmed by my healer that he said like

2816.46 --> 2820.839
yeah you actually did a really good job

2818.98 --> 2823.3
on yourself with that it worked

2820.839 --> 2826.2999999999997
extraordinarily well

2823.3 --> 2829.0
and I was like what really I thought it

2826.3 --> 2830.8
was but that was stumbling I thought it

2829.0 --> 2832.78
was barely holding on with it but

2830.8 --> 2837.0600000000004
apparently I did a great job and that

2832.78 --> 2837.0600000000004
was like kind of bizarre to hear that

2847.54 --> 2853.96
what kind of technique meditation

2850.3 --> 2857.02
Technique No it's literally calling on

2853.96 --> 2860.14
Spirit of Christ and the angels

2857.02 --> 2861.88
to put it's it's very ethereal but it's

2860.14 --> 2865.18
literally to like

2861.88 --> 2868.96
put your spirit and your soul back in

2865.18 --> 2871.6189999999997
your body it's lit that's literally it

2868.96 --> 2874.0
and this is allowed they're like

2871.619 --> 2876.04
designated to do that and they will do

2874.0 --> 2878.38
it you don't even have to Friendly ask

2876.04 --> 2879.94
you can literally command them and they

2878.38 --> 2882.6600000000003
have to do it

2879.94 --> 2882.66
apparently

2882.94 --> 2888.0
unless you are obstructing it

2889.96 --> 2897.7
like because you have a dark spirit with

2893.02 --> 2899.16
you that is choosing not to do that

2897.7 --> 2901.0789999999997
foreign

2899.16 --> 2904.2
making you

2901.079 --> 2908.28
or well choosing for you or just

2904.2 --> 2908.2799999999997
motivating you not to do it

2909.04 --> 2913.42
but it is always a choice

2911.26 --> 2916.0
right so yeah I discovered a whole bunch

2913.42 --> 2917.56
of ethereal things that why healer was

2916.0 --> 2918.64
doing I was always like this is a

2917.56 --> 2920.98
miracle

2918.64 --> 2922.96
and so I'm like oh man he's so he like

2920.98 --> 2926.079
he done that for like his entire life so

2922.96 --> 2928.119
yeah yeah it's he's a miracle worker but

2926.079 --> 2930.46
apparently you don't have to do it

2928.119 --> 2933.2400000000002
through a 30 years straight in order to

2930.46 --> 2933.2400000000002
get good at it

2933.4 --> 2938.38
and that kind of weirded me out

2935.56 --> 2940.839
because I was like okay I'm gonna spend

2938.38 --> 2942.819
like 30 years training this

2940.839 --> 2944.56
but apparently I'm already kind of good

2942.819 --> 2946.359
at it and that really

2944.56 --> 2951.2999999999997
really was unexpected

2946.359 --> 2951.2999999999997
but a pleasant surprise though

2957.7 --> 2961.2999999999997
you have very little knowledge about

2959.14 --> 2962.5
that kind of stuff yeah almost nobody

2961.3 --> 2964.78
does

2962.5 --> 2967.54
it's a lost art

2964.78 --> 2971.1400000000003
and it's mostly replaced by just

2967.54 --> 2975.339
New Age hippie dippy [ __ ]

2971.14 --> 2977.0789999999997
sorry to the hippies no no offense man

2977.079 --> 2983.17

oh hi you because I masu

3000.839 --> 3005.9
what

3002.579 --> 3005.9
what language is that

3010.68 --> 3013.2799999999997
foreign

3013.68 --> 3020.0
I thought so when I was saying the

3015.9 --> 3020.0
second word it sounded Japanese

3030.3 --> 3034.4900000000002
do you speak Japanese okay

3033.359 --> 3037.5499999999997
all right

[Music]

3051.24 --> 3056.52
I probably could do pronunciation of

3053.76 --> 3058.26
Japanese pretty decently the problem is

3056.52 --> 3062.42
I don't know what the hell I'm saying

3058.26 --> 3062.42
though when I do it

3062.46 --> 3069.7200000000003
but I I very much appreciate like

3067.099 --> 3072.6800000000003
well-spoken Japanese it's very

3069.72 --> 3072.68
interesting to me

3081.619 --> 3086.4
like when they act like when they like

3084.3 --> 3087.6600000000003
proudly make effort to say something

3086.4 --> 3089.819
there's like

3087.66 --> 3092.0989999999997
it's in full armor like the language

3089.819 --> 3094.2
itself becomes in full armor I find it

3092.099 --> 3097.44
very fascinating

3094.2 --> 3100.7999999999997
also how it just is built also to

3097.44 --> 3103.559
account for strong emotion as well

3100.8 --> 3106.53
as super calmness

3103.559 --> 3109.78
it's very dynamic in like how it's used

3106.53 --> 3109.78
[Music]

3112.319 --> 3117.839
up to visit Japan once yeah yeah me too

3115.079 --> 3119.579
actually I'd like to get there but I

3117.839 --> 3123.5589999999997
mean yeah

3119.579 --> 3123.559
don't see that happening anytime soon

3140.059 --> 3146.8390000000004
okay silent things sure whatever

3158.04 --> 3163.74
I never said I was a star at actually

3160.319 --> 3167.04
reading Japanese I don't know it's just

3163.74 --> 3169.4399999999996
that the way they speak I can parrot

3167.04 --> 3172.38
that I can mimic that

3169.44 --> 3175.619
I really have an appreciation for like

3172.38 --> 3176.7000000000003
how much effort they put into how they

3175.619 --> 3178.98
speak

3176.7 --> 3181.52
when they're doing their best

3178.98 --> 3181.52
anyway

3198.92 --> 3204.38
the void of compassion and politeness

3205.8 --> 3210.559
thank you

3207.42 --> 3210.559
is it though

3212.4 --> 3218.76
is it completely I mean it

3215.52 --> 3221.78
that is at the root of its strength yeah

3218.76 --> 3221.78
sure but I mean

3238.079 --> 3240.6800000000003
right

3244.579 --> 3250.44
I wouldn't say lack of compassion is

3247.319 --> 3255.319
it's just pragmatic

3250.44 --> 3255.319
like compassion can make things worse

3255.78 --> 3262.3190000000004
it is a fact

3258.0 --> 3265.2
so if you just then instead like force a

3262.319 --> 3267.119
system then you know what's going to

3265.2 --> 3269.5989999999997
happen with that system because it's

3267.119 --> 3269.599
testing

3272.339 --> 3280.22
right compassion can also be abused

3276.66 --> 3280.22
by a manipulator

3280.8 --> 3287.76
so if you're not used to giving into

3283.92 --> 3291.059
compassion then that will also help you

3287.76 --> 3295.28
not get easily manipulated

3291.059 --> 3295.28
so it's very pragmatic like that

worshiped their elders

they don't leave them on my Mountaintop

[ __ ]

3566.7 --> 3572.52
yeah

3568.26 --> 3574.079

3572.52 --> 3576.66
right

3574.079 --> 3579.1800000000003
an elderly might choose to die or

3576.66 --> 3580.859
something to spare their family or

3579.18 --> 3585.0589999999997
something like that and be really

3580.859 --> 3589.02
honorable and all that but I mean no

3585.059 --> 3591.98
they don't have like Eugenics mentality

3589.02 --> 3591.98
there at all

3592.14 --> 3596.96
they very much respect their Elders very

3594.48 --> 3596.96
typically

I mean even if the elders are kind of

3601.38 --> 3607.099
annoying

then they're still respected

3670.079 --> 3673.579

you married a Japanese woman

4230.54 --> 4235.46
to the Chinese Empire like a thousand

4233.3 --> 4239.1990000000005
years ago and more

4235.46 --> 4239.199
yeah they don't do that anymore

4239.239 --> 4246.44
yeah the nobility in China doesn't like

4243.219 --> 4249.32
make Chinese women break their own feet

4246.44 --> 4251.299999999999
so they can have the smallest shoes they

4249.32 --> 4253.4
don't do that anymore

4251.3 --> 4256.28
okay is

4253.4 --> 4259.36
it's been a quite some time since that

4256.28 --> 4259.36
has been abolished

4268.82 --> 4273.62
I love where in China so yeah stasma

4271.52 --> 4276.7390000000005
Reds that is true and it's also because

4273.62 --> 4281.12
of what inheritance

4276.739 --> 4283.82
like a woman's not gonna inherit

4281.12 --> 4286.34
so that means oh if you only have girls

4283.82 --> 4290.259999999999
in your family

4286.34 --> 4290.26
that means you lose the business

4292.46 --> 4297.7390000000005
right and with the whole period of the

4295.28 --> 4300.92
one child policy

4297.739 --> 4301.759999999999
yeah it's like then you have to have a

4300.92 --> 4304.159
man

4301.76 --> 4308.3
because otherwise you lose everything so

4304.159 --> 4312.46
that was the reason why well so many

4308.3 --> 4317.7390000000005
Chinese girls were aborted or

4312.46 --> 4317.7390000000005
deported you could say adopted overseas

4320.179 --> 4323.96
although they don't do that anymore by

4322.159 --> 4326.78
the way that's that's been quite some

4323.96 --> 4331.06
time since that stopped just say anyway

4326.78 --> 4331.0599999999995
I'm gonna get my Illuminati con song

4359.179 --> 4361.78
foreign

4380.78 --> 4384.82
ball capital in the world

4389.239 --> 4393.919999999999
well

4390.62 --> 4396.76
yeah also you get a lot of Squirt boys

4393.92 --> 4396.76
because of that

4397.4 --> 4402.199
but I mean they've reversed that policy

4400.1 --> 4403.76
for a while

4402.199 --> 4405.5599999999995
I think they're even like kind of

4403.76 --> 4408.08
encouraging the opposite now to get

4405.56 --> 4410.84
multiple kids I'm not sure

4408.08 --> 4413.98
might have just been just a very short

4410.84 --> 4413.9800000000005
period or something but

4428.9 --> 4436.719
no yeah hey hey how about I don't Google

4433.04 --> 4436.719
that nonsense okay

4437.3 --> 4443.12
and two kids Max well it's not true

4440.239 --> 4447.199
though says morettes like the whole

4443.12 --> 4449.48
child policy was always Financial

4447.199 --> 4452.98
as in oh you want more kids well then

4449.48 --> 4452.98
you have to pay another fine

4453.14 --> 4458.3
that was really it

4456.08 --> 4459.8
and yeah and nearly they went as far as

4458.3 --> 4464.62
like oh you can't pay the fine then

4459.8 --> 4464.62
literally which kid do I kill then

4464.659 --> 4471.46
families were even forced with that [ __ ]

4466.76 --> 4471.46
it was really horrific right but

4471.92 --> 4478.04
if you're really wealthy in China

4475.58 --> 4480.98
then you've always been able to have

4478.04 --> 4483.699
multiple kids always but it's only if

4480.98 --> 4483.699
you're wealthy

4495.02 --> 4502.540000000001
you could basically buy the right

4497.6 --> 4502.54
that's it so it's yeah by the privilege

4513.38 --> 4517.36
okay Terra 306 it's you

4522.8 --> 4525.8
foreign

4574.219 --> 4582.26

4593.42 --> 4596.32

4596.54 --> 4604.04
when they do it's specifically like a

4599.96 --> 4607.28
disguise thing it's like oh an outfit

4604.04 --> 4608.659
specifically for some cultural event or

4607.28 --> 4611.239
whatever

4608.659 --> 4614.239
women don't walk around like that here

4611.239 --> 4616.639999999999
yeah and we don't all walk in freaking

4614.239 --> 4619.218999999999

4640.1 --> 4644.54
like a song that happened to be triangle

4642.8 --> 4648.4400000000005
shaped with

4644.54 --> 4650.719
like vegetable paste in it it has like

4648.44 --> 4652.699
peas and

4650.719 --> 4654.32
leak and I don't know all kinds of

4652.699 --> 4655.94
things it's just grounded up in there

4654.32 --> 4659.98
it's really nice

4655.94 --> 4659.98
and organic no cheese

4660.02 --> 4663.820000000001

4664.04 --> 4667.12
and it's really good

4677.239 --> 4681.139999999999
never heard of that it's been around

4679.28 --> 4684.82
forever

4681.14 --> 4684.820000000001
it's been around since I've lived here

4685.34 --> 4689.8
they call them just to flop

4697.82 --> 4703.099999999999
yeah and I get them over at the echo

4700.58 --> 4705.699
plazas like a supermarket organic

4703.1 --> 4705.6990000000005
supermarket

4709.06 --> 4713.4400000000005

4711.199 --> 4713.44
oven

4714.44 --> 4717.339999999999

4826.159 --> 4830.44
hungry and I just felt like eating

4833.84 --> 4837.219

[Music]

4846.98 --> 4849.58
no

4850.58 --> 4853.239
never mind

4863.78 --> 4866.32
right

4868.159 --> 4874.599999999999
what's the talk I don't know Terry it's

4870.8 --> 4874.6
all over the place today again

4877.52 --> 4882.9800000000005
but I mean people are just chatting and

4879.98 --> 4886.4
I kind of like again get caught up in

4882.98 --> 4888.32
what everybody's been chatting about so

4886.4 --> 4891.199
but I mean I started out talking about

4888.32 --> 4893.48
well my healer and his techniques and

4891.199 --> 4896.78
how I've been utilizing them and how I'm

4893.48 --> 4900.259999999999
going to utilize them and how

4896.78 --> 4903.62
mind blow how my mind is blowing by just

4900.26 --> 4905.42
my findings in the application of it how

4903.62 --> 4908.0199999999995
good I am at it against my own

4905.42 --> 4908.02
expectations

4908.6 --> 4913.179
and then we kind of rolled on

4918.679 --> 4923.2390000000005
started to talk about

4920.62 --> 4925.599999999999
angels which are involved in those

4923.239 --> 4929.239
techniques and then

4925.6 --> 4931.76
Lucifer and Satan

4929.239 --> 4933.44
all that and then eventually we kind of

4931.76 --> 4936.92
moved on to

4933.44 --> 4938.599999999999
Japanese culture for some reason I don't

4936.92 --> 4941.659
even know how that happened happened

4938.6 --> 4944.2390000000005
somebody said a Japanese word I think it

4941.659 --> 4946.219
was evil Mike seeking Star Wars it just

4944.239 --> 4949.54
said something Japanese and so then we

4946.219 --> 4949.54
started to talk about Japan

4949.699 --> 4955.178999999999
for like

4951.26 --> 4955.179
15 minutes or half an hour

4958.42 --> 4961.96
and then China

4962.48 --> 4968.199
foreign

4964.34 --> 4968.1990000000005
so yeah it's whatever

4980.63 --> 4985.25
[Music]

5008.04 --> 5013.54
I still have to figure out for myself

5010.54 --> 5014.86
how to prevent myself from going to bed

5013.54 --> 5018.3
late

5014.86 --> 5018.299999999999
because it's annoying

5030.34 --> 5037.38
woman generals are a thing

5032.679 --> 5037.38
well maybe in military rank wise

5038.86 --> 5044.799999999999
but not cultural wise yeah

5042.34 --> 5049.0
so yeah if you can become a Chinese

5044.8 --> 5052.08
General woman in the Communist party oh

5049.0 --> 5052.08
yes sure

5053.5 --> 5059.699
but the common Folk

5055.96 --> 5059.699
doesn't do that

5074.44 --> 5078.78
dude what the hell are you blabbering

5076.54 --> 5078.78
about

5084.58 --> 5089.58
why the [ __ ] are you bringing up trans

5109.12 --> 5113.26
foreign

5110.699 --> 5117.299999999999
ER of the modern atomic theory used

5113.26 --> 5117.3
assumptions like Aristotle I bet he did

5130.42 --> 5134.08
but there's no evidence that it's

5132.219 --> 5137.04
actually an individual that existed

5134.08 --> 5137.04
though Edward

5159.159 --> 5163.96
to what the [ __ ] are you two talking

5161.679 --> 5165.9400000000005
about this is getting on my nerves like

5163.96 --> 5167.9800000000005
I'm not even following what the [ __ ]

5165.94 --> 5170.919999999999
you're talking about skeptic evil

5167.98 --> 5173.86
nightmare would you please stop like

5170.92 --> 5176.34
poking each other in my chat like that

5173.86 --> 5176.339999999999
okay

5177.52 --> 5184.1990000000005
it's just annoying you're not making any

5180.699 --> 5184.199
damn sense at all

5186.76 --> 5189.42
shut up

5195.88 --> 5200.219
we don't have anything to contribute

5204.2 --> 5210.36
[Music]

5207.159 --> 5210.36
okay steamy Traveler

hey shut the [ __ ] up why don't you stop

5214.239 --> 5217.718999999999
talking to me like that yeah time out

5216.52 --> 5221.38
Bang

5217.719 --> 5222.52
now you just shut the [ __ ] up

5221.38 --> 5224.7390000000005
yeah

5222.52 --> 5228.179
this is not the playground where you

5224.739 --> 5228.178999999999
just do whatever the [ __ ] you want

5228.4 --> 5233.86
yeah

5231.159 --> 5236.638999999999
stop goofing around it's extremely

5233.86 --> 5236.639
distracting

[Music]

5249.84 --> 5253.039
[Music]

5253.9 --> 5258.28
this is what do you think about them

5256.78 --> 5261.36
working

5258.28 --> 5265.54
spells through the music

5261.36 --> 5267.94
Ripple effects is the what no

5265.54 --> 5270.84
has nothing to do with each other but

5267.94 --> 5274.178999999999
yeah there are very egregious

5270.84 --> 5279.2390000000005
psychological manipulation in music

5274.179 --> 5279.2390000000005
there is very much so absolutely

5282.31 --> 5286.3
[Music]

5284.5 --> 5288.48
has nothing to do with the Mandela

5286.3 --> 5288.4800000000005
effect

5289.179 --> 5295.96
Mandela effect simply aesthetic

5292.78 --> 5297.82
correction in your memory that's what it

5295.96 --> 5300.46
is

5297.82 --> 5304.78
your mind doesn't like the way something

5300.46 --> 5307.2390000000005
looked or sounded or played out and you

5304.78 --> 5309.04
anticipated something else and then

5307.239 --> 5311.379999999999
after it happened and you were let down

5309.04 --> 5314.0199999999995
there's a chance that you kind of forget

5311.38 --> 5316.26
about it and then remember it as you

5314.02 --> 5320.56
thought it should be

5316.26 --> 5323.8
that is the Mandela effect exclusively

5320.56 --> 5326.080000000001
that and nothing [ __ ] else than that

5323.8 --> 5328.900000000001
that's the only thing the Mandela effect

5326.08 --> 5331.48
is there's no other things

5328.9 --> 5335.159
that are tied into it

5331.48 --> 5335.159
it's only that

5336.34 --> 5339.6
purely psychological

5357.159 --> 5362.94
all right skeptic yeah I have a good

5359.92 --> 5362.9400000000005
lunch I guess

5364.7 --> 5367.92
[Music]

5369.1 --> 5372.120000000001
thanks for popping by

5373.179 --> 5378.34
yeah please try to not do use my chat to

5376.42 --> 5381.2390000000005
just goof around I really don't

5378.34 --> 5381.2390000000005
appreciate that

5383.92 --> 5390.639
I'm actually really eager to talk about

5388.3 --> 5392.679
things if you're just goofing around in

5390.639 --> 5396.4800000000005
the chat there's nothing for me to do

5392.679 --> 5396.4800000000005
with that it's just in the way

5403.239 --> 5408.299999999999
the Mandela effect in effect you know it

5406.0 --> 5408.3
isn't

5410.139 --> 5414.9400000000005
it's just a correction there's always

5412.739 --> 5419.799999999999
Corrections yeah

5414.94 --> 5423.099999999999
and beside it's completely logical that

5419.8 --> 5425.08
there would be alterations to these

5423.1 --> 5427.360000000001
exact numbers

5425.08 --> 5430.199
slip radar you know why

5427.36 --> 5434.739
because the entire

5430.199 --> 5437.0199999999995
cosmology of heliocentrism is all based

5434.739 --> 5440.259999999999
on a scaling value

5437.02 --> 5442.900000000001
and that freaking changes around yeah

5440.26 --> 5445.360000000001
that just like the supposed alleged

5442.9 --> 5446.799999999999
distance to the Sun kept like scaling up

5445.36 --> 5449.98
and all that

5446.8 --> 5453.159000000001
the whole thing is all mathematically

5449.98 --> 5456.159
like an unfolding book

5453.159 --> 5457.839999999999
it's all structure only tied in

5456.159 --> 5462.239
mathematical structure you change the

5457.84 --> 5462.2390000000005
number then everything changes with it

5463.78 --> 5469.96
right so it's not surprising that

5466.3 --> 5471.58
certain values might suddenly alter and

5469.96 --> 5475.9800000000005
then they'll pretend like oh it's always

5471.58 --> 5475.98
been this oh no no no it's always that

5479.739 --> 5485.08
but they literally change numbers

5482.86 --> 5488.339999999999
and then act like it was always that

5485.08 --> 5488.34
that happens too

5488.86 --> 5492.759999999999
right but it only happens with recent

5491.62 --> 5494.5599999999995
stuff

5492.76 --> 5496.360000000001
like oh you're gonna look it up oh the

5494.56 --> 5498.219
wiki says it is this now and then

5496.36 --> 5501.159
they're not gonna tell you oh it used to

5498.219 --> 5502.84
be that but then we changed it no they

5501.159 --> 5506.0199999999995
don't tell you that

5502.84 --> 5508.06
but you might look up an older book

5506.02 --> 5510.820000000001
that didn't have that change yet and

5508.06 --> 5514.900000000001
they will still have that old number

5510.82 --> 5518.44
yeah not Mandela effect at all

5514.9 --> 5520.659
it's just changing the numbers because

5518.44 --> 5523.719
that will typically happen in the

5520.659 --> 5527.5599999999995
heliocentric model because it's all one

5523.719 --> 5527.56
Giant wireframe

5528.1 --> 5534.159000000001
of mathematical structure and

5530.26 --> 5536.08
assumptions that scale up uniformly so

5534.159 --> 5538.0599999999995
if something is changed for some reason

5536.08 --> 5540.179
then it's going to affect all the

5538.06 --> 5540.179
numbers

5541.06 --> 5543.54
together

5556.239 --> 5561.599999999999
no it's miles squared it's not per

5559.06 --> 5561.6
square mile

5562.48 --> 5568.659
a square mile has that's a

5566.1 --> 5571.2390000000005
two-dimensional surface that's has

5568.659 --> 5574.299999999999
nothing to do with how much curve

5571.239 --> 5576.759999999999
obstruction you should see over a line

5574.3 --> 5579.179
into the distance yeah so not square

5576.76 --> 5579.179
miles

5597.82 --> 5602.98
every day yeah indeed and that's very

5600.4 --> 5605.5599999999995
obviously not a Mandela effect

5602.98 --> 5608.339999999999
what I'm saying is that if some value is

5605.56 --> 5608.34
altered

5608.92 --> 5614.02
it's probably because the the math has

5611.8 --> 5616.06
been rumbling somebody's been warping

5614.02 --> 5617.7390000000005
the formula again for the entire thing

5616.06 --> 5621.34
because they needed to because they

5617.739 --> 5623.199
needed something very specific to fit

5621.34 --> 5626.219
and then everybody might come to the

5623.199 --> 5628.599999999999
conclusion like oh wait what's this now

5626.219 --> 5629.679
and we can just pretend like it always

5628.6 --> 5633.42
was that

5629.679 --> 5633.42
like it doesn't really matter anyway

5636.699 --> 5640.96
right as long as it mathematically fits

5639.159 --> 5644.138999999999
it's all good with them

5640.96 --> 5646.36
they they have no problem within that

5644.139 --> 5647.56
religion to just double think their way

5646.36 --> 5651.0
through

5647.56 --> 5651.0
things change all the time

5652.42 --> 5658.179
the eliocentric universe is not very

5654.46 --> 5660.159
stable mathematically you see it's not

5658.179 --> 5662.679
stable

5660.159 --> 5665.86
so yeah it's expected to change around

5662.679 --> 5668.62
oh we figured out how it was

5665.86 --> 5670.719
another way we just didn't think of it

5668.62 --> 5673.84
to interpret it that way and now it

5670.719 --> 5676.0
seems more stable yeah yeah

5673.84 --> 5678.34
good luck

5676.0 --> 5680.38
it's an eternal Ponzi scheme you can

5678.34 --> 5683.5
never finish it you can never have a

5680.38 --> 5686.9400000000005
completed product it's always broken it

5683.5 --> 5686.94
will always remain broken

5701.5 --> 5705.58
I don't know what the hell you're

5703.0 --> 5707.8
talking about Edward but

5705.58 --> 5711.0599999999995
I don't know why you're so fascinated

5707.8 --> 5711.06
with the atomic theory

5711.58 --> 5714.0599999999995
right

5714.28 --> 5720.659
I mean it's

5716.199 --> 5720.659
it's more like a model actually

5721.54 --> 5727.679
I mean

5723.219 --> 5732.82
is there a real physics related theory

5727.679 --> 5735.54
about atomics or was it just a model to

5732.82 --> 5735.54
try to explain

5737.679 --> 5744.0
yeah a categorization system

5741.04 --> 5744.0
it's just a model

5748.06 --> 5751.9800000000005
you can split the item no

5787.3 --> 5793.900000000001
test e isn't stable no now there is no

5791.739 --> 5796.12
model like that we don't have all the

5793.9 --> 5800.32
information the difference that happy is

5796.12 --> 5803.8
that flat earthers are honest enough and

5800.32 --> 5806.82
wise enough not to claim to know

5803.8 --> 5810.04
everything based on mathematical

5806.82 --> 5812.259999999999
extrapolation and presupposition that's

5810.04 --> 5815.219
the difference

5812.26 --> 5818.1990000000005
because we're not arrogant

5815.219 --> 5820.719
megalomaniacal retards that think they

5818.199 --> 5822.82
know all things because you could put it

5820.719 --> 5825.88
in some calculation

5822.82 --> 5827.5599999999995
without confirmation and overlooking how

5825.88 --> 5830.9800000000005
it can't work

5827.56 --> 5833.4400000000005
and how things are assumed incorrectly

5830.98 --> 5836.218999999999
systematically

5833.44 --> 5836.219
yeah

5837.04 --> 5843.219
that's the difference

5839.739 --> 5845.5199999999995
and my conception about looping

5843.219 --> 5849.84
and about the celestials

5845.52 --> 5856.659000000001
about non-space that's just

5849.84 --> 5862.3
my ideas of what potentially could be

5856.659 --> 5864.339999999999
in a fashion that makes more sense to me

5862.3 --> 5867.58
yeah I just

5864.34 --> 5871.42
think it could be that that is all it's

5867.58 --> 5874.6
just I think it can be that and I know a

5871.42 --> 5878.4400000000005
way I know ways in how it could be

5874.6 --> 5880.780000000001
falsified to be incorrect or correct

5878.44 --> 5885.159
yeah

5880.78 --> 5889.78
I know how to test whether it is looping

5885.159 --> 5893.08
how to test whether there is non-space

5889.78 --> 5894.36
how to test whether the celestials are

5893.08 --> 5897.5199999999995
indeed

5894.36 --> 5899.679
confirmably non-local holographic

5897.52 --> 5903.1
I have tests

5899.679 --> 5904.42
that can be executed in order to figure

5903.1 --> 5906.04
it out

5904.42 --> 5909.76
yeah

5906.04 --> 5913.179
so I have a exploratory ideas on even

5909.76 --> 5917.1
how to tell whether my whether my

5913.179 --> 5917.1
conceptions are correct or not

5917.18 --> 5922.7390000000005
[Music]

5918.46 --> 5926.139
yeah these ideas looping is confirmable

5922.739 --> 5926.389999999999
you can prove whether it is looping or

5926.139 --> 5929.569
not

5926.39 --> 5929.569
[Music]

5932.62 --> 5937.239
yeah it's not about oh we calculated and

5935.5 --> 5938.739
then the calculation works out so I'm

5937.239 --> 5941.0199999999995
just going to assume it's looping now

5938.739 --> 5944.138999999999
that's not what I'm doing that's bolt

5941.02 --> 5946.540000000001
hard Behavior that's how you justify

5944.139 --> 5947.7390000000005
your ball that isn't there yeah no I'm

5946.54 --> 5949.42
simply

5947.739 --> 5951.879999999999
figuring out

5949.42 --> 5955.78
if it were this

5951.88 --> 5959.4400000000005
then how would you be sure it is that

5955.78 --> 5962.58
yeah that's the thing that I spend my

5959.44 --> 5962.58
imagination on

5964.42 --> 5969.9400000000005
yeah what could be

5966.76 --> 5971.679
if it was then how would you know it is

5969.94 --> 5973.12
that

5971.679 --> 5976.26
yeah

5973.12 --> 5976.26
that's what I do

5981.08 --> 5985.04
[Music]

5986.679 --> 5990.52
you want to be part of a flat Earth

5988.3 --> 5992.6990000000005
movement well good luck because it's a

5990.52 --> 5992.6990000000005
mess

5993.34 --> 5997.54
the predominant Flat Earth movement are

5995.98 --> 6000.959999999999
disc earthers

5997.54 --> 6005.04
which is really whether they realize it

6000.96 --> 6008.04
or not kind of a second layer

6005.04 --> 6010.62
to the flatter Society

6008.04 --> 6013.679
their flutter Society adjacent

6010.62 --> 6016.739
other than not organized to do that but

6013.679 --> 6019.86
the beliefs are very much

6016.739 --> 6021.839999999999
down that road in the directions of

6019.86 --> 6024.48
flatter Society yeah

6021.84 --> 6025.5
physicality assumption bias all over the

6024.48 --> 6028.62
place

6025.5 --> 6031.08
information ignored like oh oh yeah it's

6028.62 --> 6033.12
a description disc oh yeah but it's not

6031.08 --> 6034.86
really a disc though because it doesn't

6033.12 --> 6037.699
actually fit yeah the skill is

6034.86 --> 6040.199
inconsistent in that projection

6037.699 --> 6042.78
we don't talk about that

6040.199 --> 6044.58
because airplanes they fly and know that

6042.78 --> 6045.36
proofs it is like this yeah yeah it's

6044.58 --> 6048.239
all

6045.36 --> 6052.679
a bunch of nonsense

6048.239 --> 6054.599999999999
excuses and reifications and it's not

6052.679 --> 6055.9800000000005
useful it doesn't help

6054.6 --> 6060.360000000001
at all

6055.98 --> 6064.379999999999
especially doesn't clarify a reality

6060.36 --> 6067.38
yeah just teaches you how to overlook

6064.38 --> 6070.92
things once again like in the globe

6067.38 --> 6073.62
model in order to have certainty that

6070.92 --> 6076.8
you know how it is

6073.62 --> 6079.98
by assuming something very specific

6076.8 --> 6084.1900000000005
and then bypassing the things about it

6079.98 --> 6085.44
that are obviously not true yeah

6084.19 --> 6088.0199999999995
[Music]

6085.44 --> 6090.599999999999
so that's the majority of the flood

6088.02 --> 6092.76
Earth movement

6090.6 --> 6094.4400000000005
I don't really want to be part of that

6092.76 --> 6096.42
at all

6094.44 --> 6099.54
I don't want to be part of any movement

6096.42 --> 6101.6990000000005
I mean I'll move you like how I move

6099.54 --> 6103.8
then you can move with me

6101.699 --> 6105.9
yeah that's the movement and I'll be

6103.8 --> 6107.88
part of I'm just gonna move you want to

6105.9 --> 6109.0199999999995
move with me that's cool you move with

6107.88 --> 6111.06
me

6109.02 --> 6115.159000000001
if you don't like how you move with me

6111.06 --> 6115.159000000001
I'll kick you the [ __ ] out out of my way

6117.0 --> 6130.679
that's it

6119.84 --> 6132.4800000000005
[Music]

6130.679 --> 6133.8
because if you just want to be part of a

6132.48 --> 6136.5
movement all is going to happen is

6133.8 --> 6139.860000000001
you're gonna get carried away some hurt

6136.5 --> 6141.659
mentality and act really [ __ ] and

6139.86 --> 6144.0
feel really great about it that's

6141.659 --> 6145.739
usually what happens when you become

6144.0 --> 6148.86
part of a movement

6145.739 --> 6150.78
yeah you start to move you know you move

6148.86 --> 6152.5199999999995
and then you lose control you become

6150.78 --> 6155.219
that movement and then oh it's all

6152.52 --> 6158.34
blissfully [ __ ] and nobody's looking

6155.219 --> 6160.139
down upon me for being [ __ ] because

6158.34 --> 6162.659000000001
I'm part of a group where that's okay

6160.139 --> 6164.88
that everybody acts [ __ ] in that

6162.659 --> 6166.739
sense so I can be [ __ ] and still

6164.88 --> 6169.34
feel good about myself

6166.739 --> 6169.339999999999
yeah move

6172.97 --> 6176.18
[Music]

6177.78 --> 6179.9
move

6181.22 --> 6187.089
[Music]

6187.139 --> 6191.76
no I have ideas

6190.02 --> 6194.1
and

6191.76 --> 6195.659000000001
I'm just throwing them out in the hopes

6194.1 --> 6199.56
that people will pick up on those ideas

6195.659 --> 6202.44
recognize the ideas for what they are

6199.56 --> 6205.4400000000005
well thought out

6202.44 --> 6206.94
considerable

6205.44 --> 6210.0
and then

6206.94 --> 6212.759999999999
that it spreads it's like the men I I

6210.0 --> 6215.04
would much rather want the mentality of

6212.76 --> 6216.96
how I'm approaching this this red than

6215.04 --> 6219.239
the literal ideas even

6216.96 --> 6221.639
because the literal ideas might be

6219.239 --> 6224.699
changing

6221.639 --> 6227.34
I might get another perspective of what

6224.699 --> 6230.04
it might be how

6227.34 --> 6232.5
I mean I'm right now actually in kind of

6230.04 --> 6235.44
delving in a new area

6232.5 --> 6237.78
because I've realized something I

6235.44 --> 6239.04
realized something recently

6237.78 --> 6241.619
yeah

6239.04 --> 6244.139
and it's this is how it started like the

6241.619 --> 6246.179
whole joke the QE likes the reference is

6244.139 --> 6249.119
not a joke it's a reference like

6246.179 --> 6250.139
get your own dirt right oh we can make

6249.119 --> 6252.299999999999
it

6250.139 --> 6254.52
we just needs some dirt and then we oh

6252.3 --> 6257.04
get your own dirt

6254.52 --> 6258.84
That's What God Says Against The Atheist

6257.04 --> 6260.76
who thinks that they can create life

6258.84 --> 6262.26
right

6260.76 --> 6264.4800000000005
well

6262.26 --> 6267.06
made me think about what if they didn't

6264.48 --> 6269.4
use dirt what if they used water you see

6267.06 --> 6272.9400000000005
biblically

6269.4 --> 6276.659
it is really not illogical at all to

6272.94 --> 6279.54
assume that before God arrived to create

6276.659 --> 6281.0
and shape the realm or like hit the

6279.54 --> 6285.96
shapers

6281.0 --> 6286.739
shaper Angel manifests side of God did

6285.96 --> 6289.86
that

6286.739 --> 6292.44
they'd arrived in water

6289.86 --> 6295.32
the water was there

6292.44 --> 6297.239
so if you're going to be like oh I can

6295.32 --> 6298.739
do the same thing as God well yeah you

6297.239 --> 6301.159
can't use dirt

6298.739 --> 6304.08
but you could if you could make anything

6301.159 --> 6304.98
completely from scratch purely out of

6304.08 --> 6309.42
water

6304.98 --> 6311.28
then you have a fair shot to compete if

6309.42 --> 6312.36
you manage to figure out how the hell to

6311.28 --> 6316.38
do it

6312.36 --> 6319.32
so in ways water is the original element

6316.38 --> 6321.719
of the entire realm there's a good

6319.32 --> 6323.04
chance that everything that exists

6321.719 --> 6326.28
around us

6323.04 --> 6329.42
solid gas liquid everything was

6326.28 --> 6329.42
originally water

6329.639 --> 6336.08
that's something that I've been thinking

6331.38 --> 6336.08
about but if that is the case

6336.54 --> 6344.34
it makes it very much more complex

6341.219 --> 6346.88
to think about what actually surrounds

6344.34 --> 6346.88
our Realm

6347.04 --> 6353.58
because if there is a loop

6350.76 --> 6356.34
then there is a self that's like a

6353.58 --> 6358.44
wormhole it's a self-contained space

6356.34 --> 6360.84
there isn't not an eternal realm

6358.44 --> 6363.419999999999
surrounding it they're simply only that

6360.84 --> 6366.360000000001
available space but if

6363.42 --> 6370.38
the Physical Realm was created in water

6366.36 --> 6373.199
then it is much more like a structure in

6370.38 --> 6376.679
between matter that was already there so

6373.199 --> 6378.96
there's a little conflict like that

6376.679 --> 6382.08
yeah

6378.96 --> 6385.679
my looping conception and all that is

6382.08 --> 6388.26
not the end-all it's not like this is it

6385.679 --> 6391.1990000000005
guys everything that conflicts with that

6388.26 --> 6393.4800000000005
is wrong that's not my attitude

6391.199 --> 6395.4
although I'm very much a fervent

6393.48 --> 6398.178999999999
believer that there's a good chance that

6395.4 --> 6398.179
it is looping

6400.199 --> 6404.159
right

6401.94 --> 6406.5599999999995
but it could be different and I've been

6404.159 --> 6409.5599999999995
thinking about like a what would allow

6406.56 --> 6409.56
water

6410.1 --> 6415.9800000000005
to be the fundamental element and what

6413.1 --> 6417.719
would it be I mean there's this unique

6415.98 --> 6420.299999999999
there's a lot of unique properties about

6417.719 --> 6422.9
water right you really realize that one

6420.3 --> 6422.900000000001
of them being

6423.0 --> 6429.139
you can't

6424.98 --> 6429.138999999999
compress water

6430.56 --> 6435.56
it's not like oh it's not very strong no

6433.139 --> 6438.6
you hand

6435.56 --> 6440.76
compressed water did you realize that do

6438.6 --> 6443.1
you remember that some of you

6440.76 --> 6444.6
that means that you can literally like

6443.1 --> 6447.84
rest

6444.6 --> 6450.42
an entire building on water if it's not

6447.84 --> 6453.0
able to escape

6450.42 --> 6454.86
it's incompressible after a certain

6453.0 --> 6457.5
point

6454.86 --> 6460.0199999999995
right it can evaporate it expands when

6457.5 --> 6462.96
it's ice right when it gets cold but

6460.02 --> 6467.400000000001
like in its liquid state like it can't

6462.96 --> 6469.86
be compressed it's like more durable

6467.4 --> 6471.239
than rock or Steel

6469.86 --> 6474.0599999999995
like that

6471.239 --> 6476.718999999999
if it can't escape you can't compress

6474.06 --> 6479.46
water well that actually

6476.719 --> 6481.08
frighteningly connected with me in my

6479.46 --> 6483.54
mind as to

6481.08 --> 6486.54
well that means that theoretically there

6483.54 --> 6489.719
could be infinite water

6486.54 --> 6492.48
because it doesn't matter anymore how

6489.719 --> 6496.139
much water there would be

6492.48 --> 6497.759999999999
if water simply cannot be compressed

6496.139 --> 6501.900000000001
beyond the point

6497.76 --> 6505.92
then physically with forces there could

6501.9 --> 6507.96
be infinite water in which there is this

6505.92 --> 6511.139
very specific room

6507.96 --> 6513.44
create it so we could technically be

6511.139 --> 6516.84
then surrounded by infinite water

6513.44 --> 6518.82
because it doesn't matter how much of it

6516.84 --> 6521.159000000001
there is it will simply not compress

6518.82 --> 6523.5
Beyond a certain point

6521.159 --> 6525.49
so that then can theoretically be

6523.5 --> 6528.55
infinite water

6525.49 --> 6528.55
[Music]

6530.04 --> 6533.1
yeah

6531.239 --> 6535.678999999999
I I hadn't

6533.1 --> 6539.9400000000005
thought about that before

6535.679 --> 6543.8
up until like a few days ago

6539.94 --> 6546.299999999999
so there is other

6543.8 --> 6549.360000000001
exploration options

6546.3 --> 6550.92
as to what is this place what are we

6549.36 --> 6553.44
actually surround are we surrounded by

6550.92 --> 6556.28
literally nothing no space for material

6553.44 --> 6556.28
to exist in

6556.38 --> 6561.719
or might there literally be water and

6559.139 --> 6564.2390000000005
like how and why

6561.719 --> 6566.34
water could yeah you could have an

6564.239 --> 6567.36
infinite amount of water because after a

6566.34 --> 6569.639
certain point it doesn't compress

6567.36 --> 6572.239
anymore so it doesn't matter if there's

6569.639 --> 6575.04
one block of water or a hundred

6572.239 --> 6577.259999999999
quadrillion blocks of water sitting on

6575.04 --> 6579.54
top of each other it will simply not

6577.26 --> 6584.360000000001
compress

6579.54 --> 6584.36
so it will be physically stable

6585.239 --> 6589.4
can you guys understand what I'm saying

6591.9 --> 6596.159
different forms of ice of compression

6594.179 --> 6598.619
what yeah well it could be forced to

6596.159 --> 6604.199
expand further evil nightmare but the

6598.619 --> 6608.0
point is is that just by weight or mass

6604.199 --> 6608.0
it cannot be compressed

6611.1 --> 6616.56
see and even water that is like

6613.739 --> 6620.239
hermetically sealed perfectly

6616.56 --> 6624.84
that is then Frozen it will not freeze

6620.239 --> 6627.239
it will stay liquid did you know that

6624.84 --> 6628.08
if it's like really perfectly sealed

6627.239 --> 6631.259999999999
like

6628.08 --> 6633.239
I'm not talking about putting water in a

6631.26 --> 6635.52
hole in a rock and then freezing it and

6633.239 --> 6638.339999999999
then the ice will break it up right but

6635.52 --> 6640.1990000000005
if it literally cannot expand to

6638.34 --> 6643.139
crystallize into ice

6640.199 --> 6645.36
water will stay liquid even if it's

6643.139 --> 6648.6
frozen at Frozen temperatures did you

6645.36 --> 6653.239
know that if it is incapable of

6648.6 --> 6653.2390000000005
expanding like really incapable

6653.52 --> 6659.400000000001
because it's like surrounded by a

6655.679 --> 6662.639
gigantic steel thick walls chamber or

6659.4 --> 6664.5599999999995
something then it it will not freeze it

6662.639 --> 6668.719
will not turn to ice because it can't

6664.56 --> 6668.719
expand to become that ice

6669.78 --> 6673.92
you didn't know that yeah

6672.119 --> 6676.44
and then it's literally like as soon as

6673.92 --> 6678.36
you it's like you have a block and

6676.44 --> 6681.239
theoretically you could

6678.36 --> 6683.5199999999995
like it's strong enough to prevent water

6681.239 --> 6686.459999999999
from freezing right then you you put

6683.52 --> 6689.46
like liquid nitrogen or whatever on it

6686.46 --> 6691.56
it gets really cold and then you do this

6689.46 --> 6695.58
you take the top off if that's even

6691.56 --> 6697.25
possible like click poof what'll happen

6695.58 --> 6698.94
you see the water like

6697.25 --> 6700.98
[Music]

6698.94 --> 6704.219
phrase instant

6700.98 --> 6706.5599999999995
flash freeze because suddenly it's able

6704.219 --> 6709.8
to escape the pressure and then

6706.56 --> 6712.02
crystallize and it'll freeze midpoint

6709.8 --> 6715.46
like as it is trying to expand it will

6712.02 --> 6715.46
just freeze up

6716.76 --> 6723.719
because it can't turn to ice if it's

6719.4 --> 6726.54
literally incapable of moving like that

6723.719 --> 6729.54
if it's incapable of turning to that

6726.54 --> 6732.6
eyes of initiating that crystallization

6729.54 --> 6734.46
process of freezing ice

6732.6 --> 6736.7390000000005
see

6734.46 --> 6739.32
so but all those elements of water

6736.739 --> 6740.718999999999
taking that into account then I can

6739.32 --> 6744.299999999999
certainly

6740.719 --> 6746.159
theorize logically how there could be

6744.3 --> 6749.04
infinite water

6746.159 --> 6750.0599999999995
and that's totally mind-blowing to me

6749.04 --> 6753.6
like

6750.06 --> 6755.280000000001
wait really lit infant blood right it

6753.6 --> 6758.76
doesn't matter how much it is it could

6755.28 --> 6761.099999999999
always keep working that is a staggering

6758.76 --> 6765.360000000001
realization to me

6761.1 --> 6769.58
that that is conceptually possible

6765.36 --> 6769.58
I never thought of it before this

6772.8 --> 6775.219
great

6775.86 --> 6779.639
why not infinite sound or dirt because

6777.84 --> 6781.26
that doesn't work because it doesn't

6779.639 --> 6784.4400000000005
have the properties the unique

6781.26 --> 6786.780000000001
properties of water you see there's is

6784.44 --> 6789.96
always with every material a scaling

6786.78 --> 6792.3
problem yeah you have a rock that's cool

6789.96 --> 6794.0
it's a rock oh then you have 10 times

6792.3 --> 6796.56
that amount of rock oh there's gonna be

6794.0 --> 6798.6
you know some is more way rather than

6796.56 --> 6800.280000000001
having another 10 times that rock it's

6798.6 --> 6803.46
gonna be massive

6800.28 --> 6806.4
and eventually it's gonna become too big

6803.46 --> 6809.3
yeah eventually things will disintegrate

6806.4 --> 6812.638999999999
and crumble under their own weight

6809.3 --> 6814.4400000000005
except water

6812.639 --> 6819.619
you see

6814.44 --> 6819.619
and that's what's so special about it

6823.44 --> 6825.919999999999
anyway

6828.3 --> 6834.08
it's just water not compressible or like

6831.36 --> 6834.08
no it's water

6836.82 --> 6841.159
water is uniquely incompressible

6848.82 --> 6854.28
right you know why because all other

6851.82 --> 6855.799999999999
liquids when you compress them you know

6854.28 --> 6857.4
what happens

6855.8 --> 6859.7390000000005
solidify

6857.4 --> 6863.879999999999
yeah

6859.739 --> 6868.259999999999
but water doesn't do that because

6863.88 --> 6869.42
it's solid state is more expanded so it

6868.26 --> 6872.46
can't

6869.42 --> 6875.46
solidify under pressure

6872.46 --> 6875.46
see

6885.119 --> 6890.299999999999
water can only solidify if it is able to

6887.82 --> 6890.299999999999
expand

6897.06 --> 6901.860000000001
right anyway it's been interesting but I

6899.58 --> 6905.04
think I'm gonna round out to show

6901.86 --> 6907.08
it's been already oh past three so

6905.04 --> 6911.3
but this is a really interesting subject

6907.08 --> 6911.3
I'd hope to talk more about it

6912.659 --> 6917.159
and maybe some less goofing around that

6915.36 --> 6918.96
would be great

6917.159 --> 6921.5599999999995
because then I can get to this kind of

6918.96 --> 6921.56
stuff earlier

6933.9 --> 6940.32
so yeah I hope you guys are appreciating

6937.4 --> 6943.138999999999
what I've put down the ideas here with

6940.32 --> 6944.5199999999995
the the new Option potential option of

6943.139 --> 6947.34
water

6944.52 --> 6949.7390000000005
and not because the Bible said the water

6947.34 --> 6953.6990000000005
before no it's just because of what

6949.739 --> 6956.28
water really is water is really magical

6953.699 --> 6959.46
it's

6956.28 --> 6962.099999999999
so different from every other type of

6959.46 --> 6964.8
material

6962.1 --> 6967.619000000001
and there are well these yeah these

6964.8 --> 6969.54
logical consequences like oh

6967.619 --> 6971.5199999999995
either there is a limited amount of

6969.54 --> 6972.54
space available for material to exist

6971.52 --> 6977.1
into

6972.54 --> 6980.1
to be able to have things stabilized

6977.1 --> 6982.56
but there's also now because of this

6980.1 --> 6984.780000000001
realization about water an option that

6982.56 --> 6986.820000000001
there might be infinite water it's not

6984.78 --> 6989.46
something that I can handle mentally

6986.82 --> 6990.78
it's like what do you mean infinite

6989.46 --> 6994.08
water

6990.78 --> 6997.34
like that infinite

6994.08 --> 6997.34
yeah infinite

6999.02 --> 7005.1990000000005
infinite material does not I don't like

7002.119 --> 7005.199
the idea of that it's just

7011.659 --> 7017.78
could if it were water

7014.78 --> 7018.5599999999995
and that's like kind of mind-blowing to

7017.78 --> 7021.0199999999995
me

7018.56 --> 7022.52
so I guess I'll bring that back up in

7021.02 --> 7024.580000000001
the future

7022.52 --> 7028.1
and for now I'm gonna round out the show

7024.58 --> 7030.08
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

7028.1 --> 7032.360000000001
liked this show if you did then please

please keep it coming

7054.92 --> 7057.619
uh

7056.179 --> 7059.78
right

7057.619 --> 7063.199
I'll be back tomorrow with flat Earth

7059.78 --> 7064.82
early bird number 1547

7063.199 --> 7066.739
on a

7064.82 --> 7068.599
Wednesday and I'm gonna join the Flat

7066.739 --> 7071.119
Earth debates over Nathan Oakley 1980

7068.599 --> 7073.04
Channel hope to see you there

7071.119 --> 7074.36
we'll see if I actually hang around

7073.04 --> 7078.26
there

7074.36 --> 7081.739
still kind of annoyed from yesterday

7078.26 --> 7084.4400000000005
right uh also yeah I still I kind of

7081.739 --> 7088.098999999999
want to give this show a title

7084.44 --> 7090.86
but it's been so over the place

7088.099 --> 7093.1990000000005
so I I'm probably gonna try to reference

7090.86 --> 7094.639
yeah I'm gonna call it infinite water

7093.199 --> 7096.879999999999
what am I think I think of course I'm

7094.639 --> 7096.88
gonna call

7098.06 --> 7104.92
just that because that is the core of

7101.96 --> 7104.92
this New Concept

7106.099 --> 7108.9400000000005
the point of it

7114.28 --> 7121.719
or maybe like the realm Within

7118.4 --> 7121.719
the infinite water
