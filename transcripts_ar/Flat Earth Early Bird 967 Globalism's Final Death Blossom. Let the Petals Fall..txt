211.2 --> 215.22
still be doing roughly two hour show

213.72 --> 217.92
today

215.22 --> 220.159
and hope that people will join me in

217.92 --> 220.159
chat

222.12 --> 229.09900000000002
including the whole new load of people

224.84 --> 229.099
that yes they already rolled in

229.92 --> 236.7
not that my subscriber amount seems to

232.98 --> 239.04
reflect that but yeah there is

236.7 --> 241.39999999999998
there have been new people visiting in

239.04 --> 241.4
the chat

242.939 --> 248.42
let's see what does my subscriber count

245.879 --> 248.42
say

254.42 --> 257.9
1959 who

258.66 --> 261.32000000000005
yep

270.84 --> 275.28
light you up

272.9 --> 278.4
okay good Surf and don't know exactly

278.4 --> 283.03999999999996
you're here in chat we can talk

283.68 --> 286.28000000000003
ah

310.34 --> 315.65999999999997
right so yesterday's Flat Earth debates

313.02 --> 318.29999999999995
was very interesting

315.66 --> 320.06
a lot of energy in there up until the

318.3 --> 323.88
final

320.06 --> 327.86
recording you have to show us also great

323.88 --> 327.86
hey AGM see you

329.16 --> 332.12
uh

333.72 --> 337.52000000000004
what else has been going down

365.819 --> 371.47900000000004
oh that's that's right hold on

383.94 --> 390.08
okay wow oh chat's not really blooming

387.419 --> 390.08
up right now

391.86 --> 397.62
more people in there ah hey Tom Parker

395.46 --> 399.65999999999997
okay well if that's the way you're gonna

397.62 --> 403.16
stand out Tom Parker then you're

399.66 --> 403.16
literally looking for trouble here

403.86 --> 408.12
yeah

404.819 --> 412.88
yeah nobody's nobody's nobody in the

408.12 --> 412.88
past is washing away our sins right

414.12 --> 420.66
what he did

415.74 --> 422.699
was show us the way how to avoid it as

420.66 --> 426.47900000000004
in what is sin

422.699 --> 427.74
and how do you avoid it systematically

426.479 --> 431.15999999999997
right

427.74 --> 434.52
like even bypassing

431.16 --> 437.09900000000005
focusing on the sins and staring at it

434.52 --> 440.21999999999997
and like oh no I can't be seduced but

437.099 --> 443.099
like how to completely bypass

440.22 --> 445.44000000000005
the seductions by

443.099 --> 448.8
following an entire

445.44 --> 452.52
different way

448.8 --> 455.34000000000003
as those that do dwell on sin

452.52 --> 459.74
right that's what he showed

455.34 --> 459.73999999999995
so nobody is washing away sins

463.08 --> 467.18
just showed us how to avoid it

467.22 --> 474.18
and all this exoteric mumbo jumbo

470.699 --> 476.52000000000004
chanted down the down all the

474.18 --> 479.34000000000003
generations

476.52 --> 481.5
about things that Bible doesn't

479.34 --> 484.67999999999995
literally say

481.5 --> 486.919
that part is just a waste of everybody's

484.68 --> 486.919
time

489.78 --> 495.599
yeah I don't think so that's right

493.8 --> 498.0
I don't know how many times I need to

495.599 --> 500.039
say that yeah

498.0 --> 502.56
when I first started to say that yeah I

500.039 --> 503.639
don't think Jesus died when I first said

502.56 --> 506.46
that

503.639 --> 509.22
that wasn't just like oh I'm going to do

506.46 --> 511.56
something interesting now or rebellious

509.22 --> 514.2
no no that was a stand

511.56 --> 517.68
that's called a stand

514.2 --> 520.38
and that stand is gonna stand

517.68 --> 522.659
yeah that's gonna stay

520.38 --> 525.72
now I like I know that a lot of people

522.659 --> 529.56
would like to forget that and then move

525.72 --> 532.5
on and keep chanting again right there's

529.56 --> 535.7399999999999
another group of people out there

532.5 --> 538.26
that we typically deal with that

535.74 --> 541.6800000000001
typically also do

538.26 --> 544.019
that sort of behavior they have they do

541.68 --> 546.18
that constantly

544.019 --> 548.399
they don't listen they don't take it

546.18 --> 551.4799999999999
serious they want to move on and guess

548.399 --> 556.399
what sooner or later they're gonna chant

551.48 --> 556.399
the same things over and over again

557.279 --> 564.74
I'd like to prevent

559.92 --> 564.74
this specific character yes

564.959 --> 573.1199999999999
this specific argument

568.26 --> 575.459
to not fall into the same trap

573.12 --> 579.5
stop chanting

575.459 --> 579.5
it's very simple stop chanting

580.08 --> 585.779
Stop Believing in promises for outer

583.2 --> 588.1800000000001
reach of logic

585.779 --> 590.7
and logos

588.18 --> 594.18
don't listen to suggestions that

590.7 --> 597.5600000000001
contradict the teachings about how

594.18 --> 597.56
reality works

609.959 --> 615.26
hey Tony Whitcomb

612.0 --> 615.26
and George Sanford

622.92 --> 628.16
created reality God God's design

628.68 --> 633.68
shapes reality as prey designed

634.98 --> 643.1
or accounting for all possible dwellings

639.12 --> 643.1
in every moment ever

643.5 --> 649.579
right hey and delusions

646.74 --> 652.0790000000001
in the design can carry

649.579 --> 654.7199999999999
extremely far

652.079 --> 658.3199999999999
because no even with a certain

654.72 --> 661.44
percentage of delusion people

658.32 --> 663.12
can still live for several Generations

661.44 --> 667.44
successfully

663.12 --> 670.44
in the shadow of logos this despite

667.44 --> 673.44
their delusions because as long as they

670.44 --> 675.72
don't let the delusions take them in

673.44 --> 678.1800000000001
another Direction

675.72 --> 679.62
it just remains an illusion in their

678.18 --> 682.14
mind

679.62 --> 685.14
because you can literally believe

682.14 --> 687.3
whatever you want

685.14 --> 689.88
but if you act

687.3 --> 695.12
on that belief and that belief leads you

689.88 --> 695.12
outside of logos then you got a problem

704.16 --> 709.98
yeah there you go yeah that's right

707.88 --> 713.519
yeah I'm not denying any of that good

709.98 --> 719.16
served I'm just denying

713.519 --> 722.22
that Jesus Christ is God literally and

719.16 --> 725.399
that he prayed to himself

722.22 --> 727.2
and that his supposed death

725.399 --> 729.66
which I

727.2 --> 732.48
I disagree with

729.66 --> 735.0
I literally disagree with that it is

732.48 --> 737.519
literal

735.0 --> 741.36
that that is supposed to

737.519 --> 746.399
help you not suffer consequences for

741.36 --> 748.92
this sin you act out in your life yeah

746.399 --> 752.519
that's the part where I say

748.92 --> 756.24
no no thanks that's a little bit too

752.519 --> 758.1
easy for actual reality or actual

756.24 --> 760.86
reality is a little bit more challenging

758.1 --> 764.7
than that but hey you can believe that

760.86 --> 766.8000000000001
it is real and feel all protected

764.7 --> 771.6800000000001
but yeah that's not gonna make the

766.8 --> 771.68
seductions of sin go away

774.6 --> 779.1
right the sensation of thinking you are

777.3 --> 781.8
forgiven for your weaknesses doesn't

779.1 --> 784.62
make your weakness go away

781.8 --> 786.959
and you still paid the price if you act

784.62 --> 790.26
on your weakness

786.959 --> 792.2399999999999
yeah no no manner of chanting of how

790.26 --> 793.56
you're all forgiven for everything you

792.24 --> 796.8
do

793.56 --> 800.0999999999999
just because somebody you believe is

796.8 --> 802.4399999999999
literally God and died

800.1 --> 805.2
made that possible for you yeah you can

802.44 --> 807.44
believe that but if you start acting on

805.2 --> 807.44
that

807.48 --> 814.38
eventually you will find out it's wrong

810.959 --> 816.54
and then you can make up excuses

814.38 --> 817.92
why it didn't work out for the rest of

816.54 --> 821.88
your life

817.92 --> 826.26
because sin doesn't go away

821.88 --> 830.72
it is a part of the fabric of creation

826.26 --> 830.72
as a test for our spirits

843.67 --> 846.7299999999999
[Music]

853.019 --> 858.62
yeah that's right black load is Magic

855.12 --> 858.62
card thumbnail that's right

907.1 --> 912.5600000000001
God's heart Avatar

909.6 --> 912.5600000000001
bro

912.66 --> 917.399
what

915.0 --> 919.68
infinite can pretend

917.399 --> 923.0
potential can't exist in the finite

919.68 --> 923.0
reality we dwell Within

923.16 --> 929.3
it makes sense to me why not you what

926.1 --> 929.3000000000001
what are you talking about

930.839 --> 936.0600000000001
what what have I said that counter acts

935.16 --> 939.38
that

936.06 --> 939.38
that denies that

963.6 --> 972.0
right and if you claim that Jesus is

966.899 --> 974.639
literally God's Avatar and not a a human

972.0 --> 980.279
that is extremely enlightened and then

974.639 --> 981.9590000000001
and basically appointed in Prophecy

980.279 --> 987.48
I'd like to remind you that he did

981.959 --> 987.4799999999999
supposedly live 33 years right so

991.199 --> 995.66
I didn't write

993.12 --> 995.66
see you

1001.04 --> 1004.48
okay fine

1009.98 --> 1011.98
um

1035.12 --> 1039.9189999999999
whoa Tony wait are you saying that

1037.339 --> 1041.6599999999999
somebody actually during a live steam

1039.919 --> 1044.0590000000002
stream took a shot

1041.66 --> 1048.1000000000001
and then died on camera

1044.059 --> 1048.1
holy [ __ ] for real

1057.919 --> 1062.0200000000002
hello James Mason good to see you

1104.48 --> 1109.059
to any of you guys have a clue what

1107.12 --> 1112.52
happened to Noah's Ark

1109.059 --> 1115.46
uh well not really

1112.52 --> 1116.84
but supposedly it's resting somewhere on

1115.46 --> 1119.179
a mountain top

1116.84 --> 1122.6
in Turkey

1119.179 --> 1124.7800000000002
but that might just be a silly rumor

1122.6 --> 1124.78
though

1134.48 --> 1139.6
it's on Mount right that's what I heard

1141.38 --> 1147.0800000000002
I've I haven't seen anybody actually go

1144.38 --> 1147.98
out there with like a camera and film it

1147.08 --> 1150.8799999999999
though

1147.98 --> 1150.88
thing right

1155.9 --> 1162.44
but who knows maybe it is out there by

1159.14 --> 1164.96
now but I think if it was it would be

1162.44 --> 1168.5800000000002
wider spread because yeah people would

1164.96 --> 1168.58
be interested in it a lot

1200.84 --> 1203.3799999999999
hmm

1209.6 --> 1215.48
wow

1211.64 --> 1219.14
that is interesting I'm quickly started

1215.48 --> 1222.8600000000001
YouTube searching like Mount Everest Arc

1219.14 --> 1225.2800000000002
and I quickly see plenty of top-down

1222.86 --> 1225.28
photos

1227.9 --> 1232.539
of what kind of does look like a boat

1232.7 --> 1235.8400000000001
that is interesting

1243.62 --> 1248.9799999999998
although it's not really resting on top

1246.32 --> 1248.98
of it it's

1254.659 --> 1260.74
and it is definitely petrified

1257.78 --> 1260.74
interesting

1276.02 --> 1280.34
team got it correct

1278.84 --> 1283.9599999999998
right

1280.34 --> 1283.9599999999998
well I've heard about it before

1310.7 --> 1316.26
one

1312.56 --> 1316.26
[Music]

1327.799 --> 1330.799
wow

1336.86 --> 1341.9189999999999
damn

1339.02 --> 1344.24
okay this is fascinating if this is real

1341.919 --> 1349.2990000000002
something is real but apparently

1344.24 --> 1349.299
somebody did actually go inside of there

1349.64 --> 1354.8600000000001
and took footage

1351.799 --> 1357.76
I'm bumping into this

1354.86 --> 1357.76
right now

1362.419 --> 1365.38
interesting

1376.22 --> 1384.039
right yeah this video

1379.28 --> 1384.039
apparently somebody did go in there

1384.919 --> 1389.9
filmed a whole bunch of things so I

1387.62 --> 1392.6
don't know this is just first glance

1389.9 --> 1395.0590000000002
though I haven't actually

1392.6 --> 1397.039
looked through the video in detail to

1395.059 --> 1401.059
know

1397.039 --> 1404.36
if it is all fully legit but first

1401.059 --> 1407.299
glance it did look like it was actual

1404.36 --> 1411.3999999999999
an honest

1407.299 --> 1411.4
project so interesting

1412.82 --> 1415.4189999999999
all right

1435.86 --> 1440.12
we're almost Wyatt

1438.5 --> 1442.539
found it

1440.12 --> 1442.539
okay

1452.96 --> 1458.679
okay fine

1455.059 --> 1458.6789999999999
so yeah interesting stuff

1464.09 --> 1470.829
[Music]

1484.76 --> 1491.059
the video seems rather dubious

1488.539 --> 1494.799
if you say so

1491.059 --> 1494.799
I haven't fully checked it out

1521.659 --> 1528.3400000000001
I have the stone cutter there is

1525.08 --> 1528.34
very annoying

1528.86 --> 1534.4599999999998
very

1531.14 --> 1534.46
disruptive sound

1535.12 --> 1539.4399999999998
very distracting anyway

1544.7 --> 1550.159
still photos gathered together okay well

1547.279 --> 1551.84
fine you want me to remove it I don't

1550.159 --> 1554.419
know

1551.84 --> 1559.48
just first Google glance

1554.419 --> 1559.48
I have never really dug deeply into it

1568.279 --> 1576.38
I don't even know if you're allowed

1573.08 --> 1578.539
up there and doing excavations and all

1576.38 --> 1581.419
that or if it is like a highly protected

1578.539 --> 1583.82
area if nobody's allowed in I don't know

1581.419 --> 1586.1200000000001
what the situation there is I really

1583.82 --> 1586.12
don't

1615.08 --> 1618.08
foreign

1632.24 --> 1635.919
oh by the way

1639.919 --> 1647.2990000000002
apparently Google both Google and

1643.52 --> 1651.559
Facebook are now mandating covet

1647.299 --> 1654.62
vaccines for all their employees

1651.559 --> 1659.2
in the California headquarters

1654.62 --> 1659.1999999999998
and all that it's like really

1663.919 --> 1667.72
that's gonna mess up things

1676.899 --> 1682.539
Veritas for is deleted what

1702.44 --> 1707.0
right Dean right yeah that's the

1704.6 --> 1709.059
impression I got as well but I don't

1707.0 --> 1709.059
know

1720.5 --> 1722.679
foreign

1743.84 --> 1746.98
so anyway

1747.5 --> 1756.02
about the whole vaccine situation and

1751.58 --> 1758.539
the tenacious rumor of the mandating of

1756.02 --> 1761.4189999999999
taking it

1758.539 --> 1763.279
I hope everybody by now is actually

1761.419 --> 1766.279
realizing

1763.279 --> 1769.46
that it is just a ruse that they can't

1766.279 --> 1772.1
technically do it

1769.46 --> 1776.2
right I've been talking about this for a

1772.1 --> 1776.1999999999998
while now I'm not the only one

1779.48 --> 1786.38
they can't actually mandate it

1782.96 --> 1789.32
they can't go as far as to like Force

1786.38 --> 1793.3400000000001
you down and then just put it in you

1789.32 --> 1796.6399999999999
they can't do it it's not being done but

1793.34 --> 1799.299
they can make you think they can and are

1796.64 --> 1799.2990000000002
doing it

1802.76 --> 1807.5
does anybody know anybody in the world

1805.34 --> 1808.76
where that is actually happened like

1807.5 --> 1813.399
this

1808.76 --> 1817.8799999999999
and it's not done by just crazy

1813.399 --> 1822.559
non-government vaccine obsessed cultists

1817.88 --> 1825.7990000000002
right because vaccine obsessed cultists

1822.559 --> 1827.6589999999999
can do it and when they do it it's

1825.799 --> 1829.1589999999999
completely illegal you basically have

1827.659 --> 1832.179
the right to

1829.159 --> 1836.179
lethally defend yourself against a

1832.179 --> 1838.64
lethal assault right just like with any

1836.179 --> 1840.6200000000001
random person or Thug out there doing

1838.64 --> 1841.8200000000002
that [ __ ]

1840.62 --> 1845.2399999999998
right

1841.82 --> 1848.62
but official mandate enforced by

1845.24 --> 1848.6200000000001
government hierarchy

1849.62 --> 1858.279
I don't think it can happen I don't

1852.08 --> 1858.279
think it the legal structure allows it

1863.539 --> 1867.5
I don't think the end of vaccine is so

1865.7 --> 1871.519
much it'll get away poor because it can

1867.5 --> 1873.559
no no no they won't none of it

1871.519 --> 1877.039
nope

1873.559 --> 1879.799
putting in camps dude no the freaking

1877.039 --> 1883.36
vaccine weirdos they're the ones that

1879.799 --> 1883.36
are gonna go to the Cavs

1883.82 --> 1888.6789999999999
as they find out that

1886.36 --> 1890.6589999999999
non-vaccinated people are simply not

1888.679 --> 1895.22
giving a [ __ ]

1890.659 --> 1899.6200000000001
you can't force anybody to go anywhere

1895.22 --> 1899.6200000000001
like that it's not possible

1908.0 --> 1914.72
can't coerce you they can only

1911.2 --> 1917.96
demoralize you make you panic until you

1914.72 --> 1920.6200000000001
start to believe it and then act upon

1917.96 --> 1920.6200000000001
that belief

1922.1 --> 1925.899
they're hoping that you will go

1926.0 --> 1930.64
because you think you have no other

1928.279 --> 1930.64
choice

1941.24 --> 1946.3990000000001
you take the jobs away as they are well

1943.22 --> 1948.8600000000001
you never those jobs were nobodies

1946.399 --> 1950.299
those jobs were all

1948.86 --> 1953.36
fruits

1950.299 --> 1955.059
basically of The Wider society that they

1953.36 --> 1958.4799999999998
have now

1955.059 --> 1958.48
claimed back

1977.84 --> 1985.6999999999998
like if you can point at to me where in

1982.659 --> 1988.3400000000001
any Constitution around the world you

1985.7 --> 1992.44
have the right

1988.34 --> 1992.4399999999998
to have a paying job

1998.24 --> 2003.76
I mean you have the right to work

2002.2 --> 2007.24
right

2003.76 --> 2010.96
but the paying part I don't think so

2007.24 --> 2013.179
right so if you take that for granted

2010.96 --> 2016.059
you supposedly have to write then oh

2013.179 --> 2019.3600000000001
they take away the paying jobs that were

2016.059 --> 2021.6399999999999
so easy right there yeah well you never

2019.36 --> 2024.4599999999998
had a right to them anyway you have the

2021.64 --> 2027.1000000000001
right to work you have to write to

2024.46 --> 2030.58
to a home

2027.1 --> 2032.86
up to a certain degree

2030.58 --> 2034.1789999999999
you have the right to build to build

2032.86 --> 2035.9189999999999
something

2034.179 --> 2038.8600000000001
for yourself

2035.919 --> 2042.1200000000001
if the right to

2038.86 --> 2042.12
make your own food

2051.339 --> 2055.7799999999997
what are they supposed to do

2053.619 --> 2059.44
dude

2055.78 --> 2062.139
like are you asking in the UK what

2059.44 --> 2064.98
people are supposed to do

2062.139 --> 2064.98
roll over and

2066.22 --> 2070.899
Randy that happening anymore so the only

2068.26 --> 2073.9190000000003
alternative choice is literally roll

2070.899 --> 2073.919
over and die

2078.46 --> 2086.619
or just Civil Disobedience and just say

2082.96 --> 2089.26
screw it we're not listening anymore

2086.619 --> 2092.3790000000004
and

2089.26 --> 2096.099
just doing

2092.379 --> 2097.72
yeah ignoring it it ignoring all of it

2096.099 --> 2100.96
all the policies

2097.72 --> 2103.2
social distancing vaccines just ignoring

2100.96 --> 2103.2
it

2106.48 --> 2108.839
right

2109.18 --> 2115.54
and personally not saying that I am

2112.54 --> 2117.64
effectively doing it but personally I

2115.54 --> 2119.7
wouldn't really in this scenario see it

2117.64 --> 2124.0
as a crime as to

2119.7 --> 2126.339
black male people into you're not gonna

2124.0 --> 2128.5
[ __ ] close that you are not gonna

2126.339 --> 2130.18
mandate masks you are not gonna mandate

2128.5 --> 2133.42
vaccines

2130.18 --> 2137.0989999999997
for your public service store

2133.42 --> 2137.099
or we're gonna [ __ ] you up

2138.099 --> 2144.46
but yeah that's that's me I don't

2141.88 --> 2147.7000000000003
don't know how doable that is it

2144.46 --> 2149.92
requires a certain momentum of people

2147.7 --> 2152.9399999999996
that would absolutely agree with that in

2149.92 --> 2155.92
order to do that and then maybe

2152.94 --> 2159.04
basically Force half of society to

2155.92 --> 2161.44
ignore it with the rest of the public

2159.04 --> 2163.96
so that things can still keep going

2161.44 --> 2167.38
people don't have to

2163.96 --> 2170.02
literally starve because all the food

2167.38 --> 2173.2200000000003
shops are all closed

2170.02 --> 2173.22
right but

2176.02 --> 2181.839
if you're going to purely let all these

2179.26 --> 2184.619
situations be dependent on what

2181.839 --> 2188.5789999999997
government tells you you can and can do

2184.619 --> 2188.579
you are [ __ ]

2188.74 --> 2194.3799999999997
there's no way out of that if that is

2191.98 --> 2197.2
what you think is the most determining

2194.38 --> 2200.619
factor for your survival than just

2197.2 --> 2204.359
freaking roll over and die

2200.619 --> 2209.46
because that's never going to restore

2204.359 --> 2212.44
understand this is a a feudal takeover

2209.46 --> 2215.2
of government

2212.44 --> 2218.099
and corporations working together in

2215.2 --> 2218.0989999999997
fascist Harmony

2218.26 --> 2225.099
to attack the public right they're

2222.16 --> 2231.18
taking it and they're not gonna give it

2225.099 --> 2231.1800000000003
back until they bleed and surrender

2231.88 --> 2238.0
understand and that's not just England

2235.599 --> 2240.3
or Europe but that's every freaking

2238.0 --> 2240.3
place

2240.339 --> 2245.619
it's a death blossom

2242.859 --> 2248.859
all coming out they're all coming out

2245.619 --> 2252.339
for evil and control and mind control

2248.859 --> 2255.64
Power they're coming out for it and they

2252.339 --> 2260.0789999999997
will not stop they are never gonna lay

2255.64 --> 2263.56
that down until they're dead

2260.079 --> 2265.1800000000003
you understand this is a one-way ticket

2263.56 --> 2267.46
possession

2265.18 --> 2272.3199999999997
on their part

2267.46 --> 2275.68
they will not stop until they die

2272.32 --> 2277.7200000000003
like it's demanded like they will not

2275.68 --> 2280.1189999999997
stop until you kill them do you

2277.72 --> 2282.8799999999997
understand and this is not about oh

2280.119 --> 2285.82
we're gonna push everybody to go berserk

2282.88 --> 2289.78
and then whoa we're gonna use it all to

2285.82 --> 2292.7200000000003
clamp it down and Route the core of the

2289.78 --> 2296.5600000000004
resistance no dude this situation in the

2292.72 --> 2298.8999999999996
world is way beyond that

2296.56 --> 2301.38
they don't even have that control

2298.9 --> 2301.38
anymore

2301.839 --> 2307.359
it's already unraveling from the inside

2304.42 --> 2310.42
out because it's a death blossom in a

2307.359 --> 2313.5989999999997
death Blossom all the nutrients of the

2310.42 --> 2316.1800000000003
plant roots everything it all goes to

2313.599 --> 2318.52
the blossom

2316.18 --> 2321.8799999999997
in a desperate attempt

2318.52 --> 2325.18
to create seed

2321.88 --> 2330.6600000000003
after death right that's the effect

2325.18 --> 2330.66
that's the metaphysical effect of it

2330.94 --> 2336.7000000000003
what they do now is a death Blossom and

2334.54 --> 2340.24
the idea that oh they're just trying to

2336.7 --> 2342.5789999999997
lure us out to attack so they can cramp

2340.24 --> 2346.06
down even harder that doesn't even work

2342.579 --> 2348.579
anymore I mean it will work for crazy

2346.06 --> 2349.9
individuals that completely lose control

2348.579 --> 2351.119
and just

2349.9 --> 2355.26
start

2351.119 --> 2355.26
randomly attacking people

2356.079 --> 2360.6400000000003
getting a psycho

2358.48 --> 2363.4
for no good reason

2360.64 --> 2364.66
right yeah that might give them some

2363.4 --> 2367.78
advantage

2364.66 --> 2371.02
but as long as you can avoid that from

2367.78 --> 2373.119
happening and get serious make it like

2371.02 --> 2376.78
yeah public

2373.119 --> 2379.78
versus controllers

2376.78 --> 2380.92
versus people that have this power and

2379.78 --> 2382.599
abuse it

2380.92 --> 2386.099
then

2382.599 --> 2386.099
they can't stop it

2386.32 --> 2392.6800000000003
they can't

2388.5 --> 2396.3
counteract that once it truly engages

2392.68 --> 2399.7599999999998
that's a ruse

2396.3 --> 2402.3590000000004
more fair porn more fear pouring that

2399.76 --> 2406.599
there is no way out right it's already

2402.359 --> 2410.2599999999998
nonsense to suggest that there that they

2406.599 --> 2412.0
will literally mandate vaccines that

2410.26 --> 2414.88
they will literally come to your door

2412.0 --> 2416.319
and do that they can't do that

2414.88 --> 2418.54
right

2416.319 --> 2420.94
once you realize that

2418.54 --> 2424.839
why would you believe that

2420.94 --> 2427.359
they would make it so crazy for the

2424.839 --> 2430.24
reason of the people not going along

2427.359 --> 2433.2999999999997
with it to go berserks just so they

2430.24 --> 2436.18
could crack down on them

2433.3 --> 2438.3590000000004
that is also quite a stretch at this

2436.18 --> 2438.359
point

2441.64 --> 2444.72
it's just not true

2447.28 --> 2453.579
like most of the people in the system

2449.92 --> 2456.28
now trying to somehow hold things

2453.579 --> 2457.9
together in the face of this death Bloom

2456.28 --> 2462.1600000000003
from atop

2457.9 --> 2466.5
you think that they want that

2462.16 --> 2466.5
they like it this way

2466.66 --> 2472.66
that they aren't ready to like okay when

2469.78 --> 2476.1400000000003
is this nonsense finally gonna stop

2472.66 --> 2479.319
we'd like to see these people

2476.14 --> 2483.0989999999997
trying to enforce this handing us our

2479.319 --> 2485.02
orders that are wrong and a lot of it

2483.099 --> 2487.2400000000002
illegal

2485.02 --> 2489.94
we'd like to see them pay for their

2487.24 --> 2492.5989999999997
crimes now right and that's people in

2489.94 --> 2492.599
the system

2493.48 --> 2497.04
doing the work for them

2499.72 --> 2501.8999999999996
foreign

2513.48 --> 2518.98
all the power they really have is to

2516.22 --> 2521.319
make you squirt because it's a blossom

2518.98 --> 2524.02
it's a death blossom

2521.319 --> 2526.359
all it can do is make you squirt in the

2524.02 --> 2528.839
hopes of some kind of a procreation

2526.359 --> 2528.839
effect

2530.04 --> 2535.18
inspiration perhaps maybe they're simply

2533.079 --> 2538.8390000000004
trying to inspire

2535.18 --> 2542.3799999999997
a very new generation of Pure Evil of

2538.839 --> 2544.599
pure human behavior excluding evil maybe

2542.38 --> 2546.579
they're just trying to inspire a next

2544.599 --> 2549.579
generation of becoming even more

2546.579 --> 2552.04
maniacal than they are and that's it

2549.579 --> 2554.44
right would also kind of fall into a

2552.04 --> 2558.3
death Blossom situation because they are

2554.44 --> 2558.3
losing control as they do this

2558.52 --> 2564.04
they are having the entire public turn

2561.099 --> 2565.96
against them despite the vast fast

2564.04 --> 2569.619
levels of Mind Control

2565.96 --> 2572.26
a lot of people are stepping out of it

2569.619 --> 2576.819
and that's only going to increase as

2572.26 --> 2580.0600000000004
they tighten the Noose as they tighten

2576.819 --> 2581.68
the road you have to walk through in

2580.06 --> 2584.22
order to maintain the suspense of

2581.68 --> 2584.22
disbelief

2591.78 --> 2594.909
[Music]

2602.2 --> 2608.2
right

2604.18 --> 2610.66
so realize that it's a death blossom it

2608.2 --> 2612.8999999999996
doesn't matter what they say what they

2610.66 --> 2612.8999999999996
want

2614.8 --> 2621.46
it's not gonna happen they can't do it

2617.319 --> 2623.859
unless you all fall to your knees

2621.46 --> 2626.38
and allow them to do it

2623.859 --> 2628.66
leading to you eventually rolling over

2626.38 --> 2631.42
and dying

2628.66 --> 2634.2599999999998
without any other recourse right that's

2631.42 --> 2634.26
the only thing

2637.96 --> 2643.54
artwork is cool okay BJ crew shank it's

2641.079 --> 2647.1600000000003
not my artwork it's it's literally the

2643.54 --> 2647.16
Black Lotus from Magic the Gathering

2651.18 --> 2655.54
which is by the way also the most

2653.44 --> 2656.7400000000002
expensive Magic the Gathering trading

2655.54 --> 2661.2599999999998
card in

2656.74 --> 2661.2599999999998
in Magic the Gathering history but yeah

2663.88 --> 2669.579
do you know what what it does

2667.48 --> 2674.04
the black lotus

2669.579 --> 2674.04
I didn't just choose it randomly right

2674.8 --> 2679.319
black lotus

2676.599 --> 2682.48
it's like this very special thing card

2679.319 --> 2685.72
you sacrifice it

2682.48 --> 2688.66
you throw it into the graveyard in order

2685.72 --> 2691.66
to attain Mana

2688.66 --> 2693.94
that you can use for spells

2691.66 --> 2696.16
yeah

2693.94 --> 2697.96
isn't that just fitting

2696.16 --> 2700.48
and now those people that understand

2697.96 --> 2703.66
Magic the Gathering will see how well

2700.48 --> 2706.44
that fits in the title and in the story

2703.66 --> 2706.44
I'm putting down

2707.26 --> 2712.8390000000004
yeah free Mana but free Mana after death

2710.8 --> 2715.44
after destruction

2712.839 --> 2715.44
right

2716.319 --> 2721.24
the Black Lotus dies

2719.02 --> 2722.92
in the in the

2721.24 --> 2724.5989999999997
in the story

2722.92 --> 2728.8
of that game world

2724.599 --> 2730.2400000000002
it dies in order to achieve that

2728.8 --> 2732.04
right

2730.24 --> 2733.9599999999996
it's not just oh you have this thing and

2732.04 --> 2737.079
it just gives you free Manna whenever

2733.96 --> 2739.599
you like no you have to sacrifice it and

2737.079 --> 2743.46
that is part of what the point where I

2739.599 --> 2743.46
used it in the title card

2753.88 --> 2756.6600000000003
foreign

2783.28 --> 2786.2400000000002
that's right

2788.68 --> 2794.56
that's right Phoenix Rising well the

2791.079 --> 2796.0600000000004
card is extremely valuable in the game

2794.56 --> 2800.7599999999998
that's why it's one of the most

2796.06 --> 2800.7599999999998
expensive cards trading cards ever

2803.319 --> 2809.94
but it's only because of the quick

2806.02 --> 2809.94
advantage that it provides

2810.28 --> 2816.0400000000004
the quickness it provides

2813.76 --> 2818.2200000000003
you have an old fake yeah I'm sure you

2816.04 --> 2818.22
do

2830.38 --> 2833.099
hmm

2861.579 --> 2865.559
double cutting has finally ended

2889.059 --> 2893.76
anyway

2890.6 --> 2893.7599999999998
[Music]

2897.25 --> 2900.809
[Music]

2904.72 --> 2908.5589999999997
um

2905.7 --> 2910.72
man I have to say by the way that

2908.559 --> 2915.2400000000002
recently I think that oh Benjamin is

2910.72 --> 2915.24
just really really crushing it

2918.04 --> 2924.3
did any of you see like the video he

2921.22 --> 2924.2999999999997
uploaded recently

2925.059 --> 2931.079
quite impressive

2927.46 --> 2931.079
viruses don't exist

2931.119 --> 2935.92
I will link you to it it's like a 20

2933.819 --> 2938.64
minute video definitely worth watching

2935.92 --> 2938.64
this one as well

2960.839 --> 2964.44
be back in two minutes

3034.859 --> 3037.64
foreign

3060.26 --> 3069.7400000000002
as he said they were fake in vid I saw

3065.9 --> 3069.7400000000002
959 was a bit different

3070.02 --> 3076.2599999999998
it was a conspiracy theory and it was

3073.38 --> 3079.26
obviously ridiculous return to normal I

3076.26 --> 3082.26
hope you realize that

3079.26 --> 3086.8390000000004
would be a little worried if you hadn't

3082.26 --> 3086.8390000000004
kind of pile it on pretty thickly there

3086.88 --> 3092.6400000000003
I mean what a genetically modified Panda

3090.359 --> 3095.18
Army

3092.64 --> 3095.18
really

3097.74 --> 3104.04
no Daffy Duck it's a green tea I don't

3101.16 --> 3105.18
drink vitamin elixirs I take supplements

3104.04 --> 3106.5589999999997
and

3105.18 --> 3109.7
I don't

3106.559 --> 3109.7000000000003
take them in a drink

3137.579 --> 3142.26
right by the way I have been thinking

3139.98 --> 3145.38
about more about the whole Panda thing

3142.26 --> 3148.8
right I don't think pandas are actually

3145.38 --> 3153.119
fake I've seen pandas do things and like

3148.8 --> 3156.6600000000003
fall outer trees and [ __ ] no human

3153.119 --> 3159.559
would survive that literally they would

3156.66 --> 3159.5589999999997
not survive it

3162.48 --> 3168.18
but I think that pandas are probably

3164.96 --> 3169.619
unnatural as in they are an unnatural

3168.18 --> 3172.74
crossbreed

3169.619 --> 3175.619
a genetic crossbreed

3172.74 --> 3177.4799999999996
and they never naturally existed and

3175.619 --> 3179.339
that's why there's no history of them

3177.48 --> 3181.14
being in the wild

3179.339 --> 3184.339
up until

3181.14 --> 3184.339
the 20th century

3186.24 --> 3191.8799999999997
but yeah and hey I think there might

3188.7 --> 3193.5
actually be people dressing up as pandas

3191.88 --> 3196.2000000000003
and Panda suits

3193.5 --> 3197.819
but that doesn't mean that they are all

3196.2 --> 3200.46
people in suits

3197.819 --> 3203.16
I don't think so I don't I've never seen

3200.46 --> 3206.339
a person in any kind of suit

3203.16 --> 3211.2
any sort of suit that could fall like

3206.339 --> 3216.0589999999997
down like 10 meters out of a tree

3211.2 --> 3219.48
and not die of like broken back injuries

3216.059 --> 3221.0400000000004
and [ __ ] there's no way

3219.48 --> 3223.44
doesn't matter what kind of a suit

3221.04 --> 3225.839
you're wearing unless it's like a giant

3223.44 --> 3227.88
plastic bubble surrounding you as a

3225.839 --> 3230.7599999999998
giant air cushion there's no freaking

3227.88 --> 3233.04
way any human being could fall from that

3230.76 --> 3234.059
height straight onto the ground and not

3233.04 --> 3236.579
die

3234.059 --> 3239.8390000000004
this is

3236.579 --> 3239.8390000000004
wow great

3240.18 --> 3242.5989999999997
man

3246.18 --> 3250.6189999999997
they seem not suited for the well they

3248.28 --> 3252.619
they are ridiculous creatures they don't

3250.619 --> 3256.4
seem to have normal

3252.619 --> 3256.4
bear-like instincts

3259.559 --> 3266.6400000000003
like the very I the very nature that

3263.22 --> 3268.319
they just like to climb up trees really

3266.64 --> 3271.7599999999998
really high

3268.319 --> 3276.54
to the tippy top Until It Breaks

3271.76 --> 3279.5400000000004
that makes no sense how many other large

3276.54 --> 3281.88
mammal animals have you ever seen doing

3279.54 --> 3285.24
that

3281.88 --> 3286.7400000000002
I mean not even Apes do that monkeys

3285.24 --> 3289.5
might do it but that's because they're

3286.74 --> 3292.5
very light and nimble and they wouldn't

3289.5 --> 3294.9
break like no big creature that has

3292.5 --> 3297.96
weight is or is going to climb to the

3294.9 --> 3301.559
tippy top of a tree Until It Breaks it

3297.96 --> 3304.14
makes no sense no animal does that no

3301.559 --> 3306.48
wild animal would do such a thing

3304.14 --> 3310.2599999999998
unless they I don't have Natural

3306.48 --> 3314.059
Instincts because they're originally a

3310.26 --> 3314.059
bizarre crossbreed

3315.599 --> 3323.059
can be a bit slow is Owen joking

3318.299 --> 3323.059
yes I think he's definitely joking

3325.799 --> 3330.78
but I think that he's kind of keeping it

3328.619 --> 3332.76
in the middle whether it is a joke or

3330.78 --> 3334.799
not and hey there are probably there

3332.76 --> 3339.119
have probably been people dressed up in

3334.799 --> 3341.819
Panda suits that is real I think right

3339.119 --> 3345.119
he's just kind of making a joke

3341.819 --> 3347.2799999999997
by uniform making it All Uniform into

3345.119 --> 3349.44
like okay that means they're all fake

3347.28 --> 3351.3590000000004
and there is all people in in costumes

3349.44 --> 3352.859
because it's a really funny idea to

3351.359 --> 3355.7
think about it like that right I think

3352.859 --> 3355.7
that is his joke

3369.48 --> 3375.299
right yeah Daffy Duck octopi are very

3371.94 --> 3378.54
weird creatures and they are sentient

3375.299 --> 3381.54
like they have feelings

3378.54 --> 3384.18
did you know that did you know that they

3381.54 --> 3387.299
actually have

3384.18 --> 3389.0989999999997
senses for feelings they can feel how

3387.299 --> 3391.68
you feel

3389.099 --> 3393.299
I think that octopi sounds a bit silly

3391.68 --> 3396.1189999999997
if I when I put it like I think they

3393.299 --> 3399.619
might even be partially telepathic like

3396.119 --> 3399.619
some other animals are too

3404.579 --> 3408.92
is this an old thing no

3409.44 --> 3412.579
not that old

3414.54 --> 3418.5
but the whole thing is is that pandas

3416.76 --> 3421.44
aren't there little there's no

3418.5 --> 3423.74
historical record of pandas existing in

3421.44 --> 3423.7400000000002
the wild

3424.319 --> 3428.46
before the 20th century

3427.2 --> 3430.0789999999997
so

3428.46 --> 3433.38
and that's a fact

3430.079 --> 3437.2200000000003
no record whatsoever and there should be

3433.38 --> 3439.1400000000003
China is incredibly old why the hell

3437.22 --> 3442.2599999999998
would there not be a record of panda

3439.14 --> 3446.0589999999997
bears before the 20th century that makes

3442.26 --> 3446.059
no bloody sense whatsoever

3453.9 --> 3456.2000000000003
foreign

3460.319 --> 3465.66
maybe China is karmically not allowed to

3462.839 --> 3468.839
invade other continents well maybe they

3465.66 --> 3470.52
refrain from it no matter the cost

3468.839 --> 3473.099
because

3470.52 --> 3476.7599999999998
they know from historical experience

3473.099 --> 3478.94
with other nations

3476.76 --> 3481.7400000000002
that it always

3478.94 --> 3484.5
leads to Doom

3481.74 --> 3486.66
so they may simply choose to never do

3484.5 --> 3489.839
that and they might not even need it

3486.66 --> 3492.74
anymore right in many ways like war is

3489.839 --> 3492.74
already outdated

3493.98 --> 3500.16
because in modern times you just

3496.16 --> 3504.6189999999997
manipulate and neck some other group to

3500.16 --> 3504.6189999999997
death that's how you do it or well yeah

3505.559 --> 3511.079
killing groups of people in the country

3508.26 --> 3513.6800000000003
itself yeah they do that it's pretty

3511.079 --> 3513.6800000000003
disgusting

3521.7 --> 3528.5
but yeah slow mo moon buggy you could

3524.819 --> 3531.0589999999997
say it that it that's karmically but

3528.5 --> 3533.16
the weird thing though is that karma is

3531.059 --> 3535.98
kind of a responsive thing so I don't

3533.16 --> 3538.5
think that China has ever done it

3535.98 --> 3540.54
I don't see how it that could be the

3538.5 --> 3542.22
karma that would prevent them from

3540.54 --> 3544.7
evading

3542.22 --> 3548.22
I think they just

3544.7 --> 3550.7
know that war on the long run is always

3548.22 --> 3550.7
useless

3570.9 --> 3576.0
scientists are using animal behavior to

3573.599 --> 3579.119
create better AI algorithms

3576.0 --> 3581.299
I don't know about that part Daffy Duck

3579.119 --> 3584.28
what I do know though is that

3581.299 --> 3587.64
engineering Developers

3584.28 --> 3591.119
are more and more studying

3587.64 --> 3593.7599999999998
animal maneuverability

3591.119 --> 3596.339
and applying that

3593.76 --> 3599.88
to engineering

3596.339 --> 3603.0
right that's really stands up I I mean

3599.88 --> 3606.119
like really really stands out that they

3603.0 --> 3609.619
do that in engineering constantly

3606.119 --> 3609.619
mimicking nature

3609.9 --> 3617.1600000000003
because it works really well

3612.72 --> 3618.66
God's designs are marvelous and

3617.16 --> 3621.7799999999997
humans

3618.66 --> 3624.5989999999997
Echo it they attempt to Echo the design

3621.78 --> 3627.2000000000003
in their engineering because it just

3624.599 --> 3627.2000000000003
works better

3631.92 --> 3635.48
what are you talking about AGM

3644.52 --> 3651.14
you and it's mainly Chinese Army oh

3647.4 --> 3651.14
really so where are they then

3652.44 --> 3658.579
they are on other continent yeah but

3655.02 --> 3658.579
it's not China though

3677.339 --> 3682.44
I see this more than just a flatter

3679.14 --> 3684.42
Channel yeah it is CPS

3682.44 --> 3687.44
it is more than just the flatters

3684.42 --> 3687.44
channel of course it is

3701.819 --> 3706.799
hm

3703.92 --> 3710.16
like what what are they gonna do

3706.799 --> 3711.839
preparing for dude always preparing for

3710.16 --> 3716.5989999999997
that

3711.839 --> 3716.599
in ways but what are they gonna do then

3716.64 --> 3721.5589999999997
have you thought about it or are you

3718.859 --> 3725.16
just like oh I want to beat some war

3721.559 --> 3727.1400000000003
drum again because I want War I want war

3725.16 --> 3729.24
so I'm going to Envision that it's

3727.14 --> 3732.0589999999997
happening is that what you're doing

3729.24 --> 3735.18
the final word yeah

3732.059 --> 3737.7000000000003
oh so

3735.18 --> 3740.7599999999998
you're longing for Armageddon are you

3737.7 --> 3742.799
AGM is that is that what you're gonna

3740.76 --> 3745.8190000000004
project

3742.799 --> 3745.819
onto the world

3757.92 --> 3763.579
you in Prophecy except Nobody Knows the

3760.799 --> 3763.579
hour yeah

3763.859 --> 3766.0389999999998
foreign

3798.839 --> 3803.7799999999997
don't worry about it return to normal

3801.0 --> 3806.039
it's not

3803.78 --> 3808.079
agm's just projecting it's not the first

3806.039 --> 3812.46
time he's doing it there's a whole range

3808.079 --> 3814.799
of people especially Christians that cat

3812.46 --> 3818.339
it caught up in that and they're just oh

3814.799 --> 3822.059
I'm fantasizing it's coming his Doom

3818.339 --> 3824.5789999999997
wake up we're all going to die this war

3822.059 --> 3827.88
and everything's gonna be destroyed in

3824.579 --> 3827.88
any Antichrist

3828.119 --> 3834.78
why don't you just snap out of it

3831.539 --> 3836.28
and actually realizes to what is going

3834.78 --> 3839.8390000000004
on tactically

3836.28 --> 3839.8390000000004
and listen to the

3840.42 --> 3847.7400000000002
Vice

3842.52 --> 3851.64
that's for right here right now

3847.74 --> 3854.4599999999996
and just start ignoring staring this you

3851.64 --> 3856.319
need to stop staring into the future of

3854.46 --> 3860.339
Doom dude

3856.319 --> 3863.2799999999997
just stop doing that forever stop that

3860.339 --> 3864.9
never do it again it's completely

3863.28 --> 3868.7400000000002
useless

3864.9 --> 3870.059
it's literally squirting when you do

3868.74 --> 3872.8799999999997
that

3870.059 --> 3875.6400000000003
just don't

3872.88 --> 3877.619
if you feel something

3875.64 --> 3882.5989999999997
sure give expression to that feeling

3877.619 --> 3886.619
don't project those feelings onto a doom

3882.599 --> 3890.339
of of the world okay don't do that

3886.619 --> 3893.579
I don't care what book says what don't

3890.339 --> 3898.099
do that ever don't do that just never do

3893.579 --> 3898.099
that it is extremely unproductive

3899.52 --> 3906.24
don't know the hour why don't you listen

3903.119 --> 3909.0
to that part of the Bible you don't know

3906.24 --> 3910.9199999999996
the hour you can't say it's coming you

3909.0 --> 3914.099
don't know it's coming

3910.92 --> 3916.799
why did you focus on here and now and

3914.099 --> 3920.52
the scenario of now and the tactics of

3916.799 --> 3921.96
now instead of projecting your doom onto

3920.52 --> 3924.0
the future

3921.96 --> 3926.96
stop dwelling on it

3924.0 --> 3926.96
it's useless

3938.819 --> 3942.96
what's gonna happen on the long term

3941.28 --> 3944.46
we already know what's going to happen

3942.96 --> 3946.98
on the long term

3944.46 --> 3949.14
it's just going to be Perpetual Bluff

3946.98 --> 3951.059
after Bluff after Bluff a whole bunch of

3949.14 --> 3952.0789999999997
people that have taken vaxes are gonna

3951.059 --> 3953.52
die

3952.079 --> 3957.539
slowly

3953.52 --> 3960.48
quickly at first and then slowly and

3957.539 --> 3962.7000000000003
heavy attrition

3960.48 --> 3965.52
in human ranks in the west especially

3962.7 --> 3969.0
but also other countries and then

3965.52 --> 3971.46
they're just gonna move on to the next

3969.0 --> 3973.799
story and pretend like it'll never

3971.46 --> 3977.76
happen because it didn't really work out

3973.799 --> 3981.839
because they're not winning they're not

3977.76 --> 3985.2000000000003
winning they're in a death Blossom they

3981.839 --> 3989.4
are not winning them coming out of the

3985.2 --> 3992.3999999999996
Colossal closet for being Pure Evil and

3989.4 --> 3995.099
wanting to eradicate humanity is not

3992.4 --> 3997.5
because they win it is because they're

3995.099 --> 3999.6800000000003
losing

3997.5 --> 3999.68
foreign

4004.64 --> 4009.2
why are people going to die from the vax

4006.74 --> 4010.819
because of Spike proteins because it

4009.2 --> 4014.799
genetically modifies them to

4010.819 --> 4014.799
self-destruct that's why

4021.98 --> 4027.22
you're welcome classical homeopath I do

4024.74 --> 4027.22
what I can

4027.68 --> 4032.839
and I need to tell myself too sometimes

4030.799 --> 4036.44
because

4032.839 --> 4038.72
like AGM does it like in the chat here

4036.44 --> 4041.96
and it annoys me a little but it's fine

4038.72 --> 4045.319
you know it's a recurring theme with him

4041.96 --> 4047.7200000000003
I know it is I just have to remind him

4045.319 --> 4049.819
sometimes I have to remind myself too

4047.72 --> 4052.64
and I don't mean like I will never do

4049.819 --> 4055.46
that like in public like that and if I

4052.64 --> 4057.5589999999997
do I will immediately recognize it as a

4055.46 --> 4059.7200000000003
personal panic and then immediately

4057.559 --> 4062.48
correct it and apologize for it and

4059.72 --> 4064.9399999999996
clear up like why it was wrong because I

4062.48 --> 4068.359
know that now

4064.94 --> 4070.16
right so sometimes your feelings can

4068.359 --> 4072.2
pull you towards

4070.16 --> 4074.66
looking at the world

4072.2 --> 4076.46
like it's all doomed because yeah all

4074.66 --> 4078.799
the elements for that

4076.46 --> 4081.14
are there potentially you could

4078.799 --> 4083.359
theoretically point out how it's all

4081.14 --> 4085.8799999999997
going to do but it's not actually

4083.359 --> 4089.18
happening that's just your feelings

4085.88 --> 4092.319
telling you that in that moment

4089.18 --> 4092.319
it's not real

4093.74 --> 4101.0
the only actual reality about things

4097.819 --> 4104.96
happening in the world is the one

4101.0 --> 4109.299
that you Attain upon having a clear

4104.96 --> 4109.299
moment that means no feelings

4109.94 --> 4115.04
and that doesn't mean like cut all your

4112.1 --> 4119.779
feelings off and be completely apathetic

4115.04 --> 4122.96
no no just don't have strong feelings

4119.779 --> 4126.1990000000005
about things and then you will much more

4122.96 --> 4129.5
clearly see what is actually real

4126.199 --> 4132.259
and how things are being manipulated in

4129.5 --> 4134.42
order to push you towards having those

4132.259 --> 4137.259
feelings in order to not see things

4134.42 --> 4139.88
clearly it's part of their design

4137.259 --> 4143.62
psychological warfare

4139.88 --> 4143.62
don't give in to it ever

4180.319 --> 4187.4800000000005
wouldn't it be easier and cheaper to

4183.259 --> 4187.48
poison food and no no it wouldn't CPS

4188.299 --> 4196.34
it would not be easier at all because

4193.219 --> 4198.199
food and water are much more strictly

4196.34 --> 4199.6990000000005
guarded and there's much more known

4198.199 --> 4202.04
about it

4199.699 --> 4204.199
vaccines

4202.04 --> 4207.0199999999995
yeah

4204.199 --> 4209.0599999999995
like in order to do the same thing as

4207.02 --> 4210.8
they're doing with these vaccines with

4209.06 --> 4214.280000000001
the food and the water they would have

4210.8 --> 4217.159000000001
to actually convince people to put the

4214.28 --> 4219.62
poison in their own food and water

4217.159 --> 4221.0599999999995
it's not going to work it's going to be

4219.62 --> 4223.88
too obvious

4221.06 --> 4227.54
too much knowledge to make that happen

4223.88 --> 4231.02
the vaccines is like a

4227.54 --> 4233.54
a private corporate domain

4231.02 --> 4235.6990000000005
and people just go with it because they

4233.54 --> 4237.8
trust it right that's the only thing

4235.699 --> 4240.678999999999
that's actually making it work the Mind

4237.8 --> 4242.84
Control about it they can't do that with

4240.679 --> 4245.0
food and water anymore

4242.84 --> 4247.9400000000005
the poisoning of food and water is

4245.0 --> 4250.64
actually really only retracting over

4247.94 --> 4255.5
time because so much is known about it

4250.64 --> 4258.6990000000005
and the people are learning to guard it

4255.5 --> 4258.699
no matter what

4259.76 --> 4264.4400000000005
not you can't do it at the source at the

4262.58 --> 4266.42
source what you mean they're gonna

4264.44 --> 4268.759999999999
literally poison the groundwater

4266.42 --> 4271.04
everywhere

4268.76 --> 4273.9800000000005
what they're gonna come over to your

4271.04 --> 4275.36
farm and then put the poison in your

4273.98 --> 4278.678999999999
ground

4275.36 --> 4278.679
they can't do that

4280.04 --> 4283.179
it's too obvious

4286.64 --> 4292.159000000001
the best they're they're getting out of

4288.98 --> 4295.339999999999
it right now is fluoridated water and

4292.159 --> 4298.04
not telling people about it and having

4295.34 --> 4300.1990000000005
Farmers being Reckless just spraying the

4298.04 --> 4301.94
fluoridated water on their crops and

4300.199 --> 4304.04
that's like as bad as it gets pretty

4301.94 --> 4308.239
much

4304.04 --> 4309.86
except for a GMO [ __ ] right the GMO is

4308.239 --> 4314.0
still going but people don't want it

4309.86 --> 4316.42
people don't want the GMO they don't

4314.0 --> 4316.42
want it

4318.699 --> 4322.4
the Netherlands will vote to leave the

4321.44 --> 4324.5
EU

4322.4 --> 4327.379999999999
that's a good one

4324.5 --> 4333.04
Daffy Duck that's hilarious

4327.38 --> 4333.04
that is absolutely profoundly hilarious

4333.8 --> 4337.42
the Netherlands is

4337.699 --> 4344.0599999999995
foreign

4340.4 --> 4345.44
like almost on the throne like they

4344.06 --> 4348.860000000001
can't leave

4345.44 --> 4350.36
like it literally all falls apart very

4348.86 --> 4351.62
quickly

4350.36 --> 4355.4
like

4351.62 --> 4357.98
Netherlands is like the glue to keep the

4355.4 --> 4359.599999999999
bigger parties in line it doesn't work

4357.98 --> 4361.459999999999
they can't leave the Netherlands could

4359.6 --> 4363.4400000000005
never leave I can't imagine it would

4361.46 --> 4365.54
leave

4363.44 --> 4367.639999999999
like the only place the time it will

4365.54 --> 4370.219
leave is when everybody's already

4367.64 --> 4373.219
breaking off then it's no more use

4370.219 --> 4375.679
right and they'll just rush to become

4373.219 --> 4377.3
part of whatever new alliance or system

4375.679 --> 4378.92
is gonna rise because that's what

4377.3 --> 4382.3
Netherlands does it's a very small

4378.92 --> 4387.26
country it is purely dependent on

4382.3 --> 4387.26
diplomatic and Commercial relationships

4387.8 --> 4393.62
and getting busy forming alliances and

4391.46 --> 4396.52
keeping other groups together that's

4393.62 --> 4396.5199999999995
what it does now

4396.92 --> 4402.76
as long as Europe is kind of being held

4399.44 --> 4405.5599999999995
together even though in a very bad place

4402.76 --> 4408.26
Netherlands can't step out

4405.56 --> 4410.659000000001
do you think that the other European

4408.26 --> 4413.38
nations are going to let the Netherlands

4410.659 --> 4416.12
just step out look at how much friction

4413.38 --> 4419.0
England got

4416.12 --> 4421.28
over it okay look at how freaking much

4419.0 --> 4424.159
brexit

4421.28 --> 4426.92
and that's England that's a pretty big

4424.159 --> 4429.739
country with an imperial history and a

4426.92 --> 4433.179
lot of connections and if

4429.739 --> 4433.178999999999
a pretty reputable

4433.219 --> 4437.84
nobility

4435.739 --> 4439.58
that don't take no [ __ ] and are known

4437.84 --> 4442.28
for that yeah

4439.58 --> 4443.96
the Netherlands man then let's Ken you

4442.28 --> 4447.08
think that if we go through the same

4443.96 --> 4450.5
that dude it'd be over

4447.08 --> 4455.179
they'd lit yeah

4450.5 --> 4456.5
the best we could do is neutralize

4455.179 --> 4458.54
the

4456.5 --> 4463.219
Neo feudal

4458.54 --> 4465.8
globalist influences and just be

4463.219 --> 4471.04
our little country in between it all and

4465.8 --> 4471.04
do the managerial things that we do

4471.32 --> 4476.599999999999
right I can't leave Europe but we can

4475.1 --> 4480.92
ignore

4476.6 --> 4483.320000000001
the autocratic evil laws within it

4480.92 --> 4485.06
huh

4483.32 --> 4488.0599999999995
dude do you know how much the

4485.06 --> 4490.280000000001
Netherlands actually infuses Europe

4488.06 --> 4493.2390000000005
with financial power

4490.28 --> 4493.239
it's unbelievable

4494.3 --> 4499.46
it's just no way they're gonna step out

4496.58 --> 4502.159
there's just no way

4499.46 --> 4505.52
but I think that we can maneuver towards

4502.159 --> 4507.739
a government system that will ignore the

4505.52 --> 4510.26
autocratic top-down

4507.739 --> 4513.678999999999
the bureaucracy from the unelected

4510.26 --> 4516.64
European government right that part I do

4513.679 --> 4516.64
believe is possible

4518.36 --> 4526.0599999999995
and get on with leave Europe and then

4522.199 --> 4526.0599999999995
build a bridge to Norfolk

4526.34 --> 4530.900000000001
that's hilarious

4528.26 --> 4533.6
hello Adam Aiken by the way

4530.9 --> 4536.239
Globe is scientifically impossible thank

4533.6 --> 4539.14
you for the 10 pound Super Chat donation

4536.239 --> 4539.139999999999
multi TomTom

4539.48 --> 4542.44
appreciate that

4546.199 --> 4551.78
right but I think on the long run for

4549.14 --> 4555.38
also for the Netherlands

4551.78 --> 4557.7699999999995
for the original free Dutch

4555.38 --> 4560.3
spirits that are left here

4557.77 --> 4563.179
[Music]

4560.3 --> 4566.96
I think it's optimal if we could

4563.179 --> 4568.1
literally sweat out this this crap from

4566.96 --> 4570.8
Europe

4568.1 --> 4573.02
is weird

4570.8 --> 4576.26
corruption at the top

4573.02 --> 4578.540000000001
we can sweat it out undo it and refer it

4576.26 --> 4581.659000000001
back to the older European agreement

4578.54 --> 4585.739
which was basically a trade agreement it

4581.659 --> 4588.08
was it was actually okay right

4585.739 --> 4591.199
it's when all that garbage was starting

4588.08 --> 4594.32
to get built on top when they started to

4591.199 --> 4596.0
build that stupid Tower of Babel

4594.32 --> 4598.34
mockery

4596.0 --> 4601.159
in Belgium and started to have the

4598.34 --> 4604.64
unelected government [ __ ] that's when

4601.159 --> 4608.239
things really went wrong but before that

4604.64 --> 4611.900000000001
it was a pretty decent agreement

4608.239 --> 4614.9
right and if it hadn't grown as bad as

4611.9 --> 4616.879999999999
it did then England would probably still

4614.9 --> 4619.339999999999
be part of Europe right now

4616.88 --> 4621.14
because the trade agreement was pretty

4619.34 --> 4624.46
good

4621.14 --> 4624.46
it was very useful

4624.5 --> 4629.96
this freaking autocratic [ __ ]

4627.8 --> 4633.92
government however of Europe that is

4629.96 --> 4637.04
unelected that part is completely and

4633.92 --> 4639.86
utterly useless and should be discarded

4637.04 --> 4642.28
and surgically removed as quickly as

4639.86 --> 4642.28
possible

4650.719 --> 4656.62
could you not extend the Netherlands

4653.06 --> 4656.620000000001
into the North Sea what

4658.1 --> 4663.38
I mean I think technically the

4660.5 --> 4665.6
Netherlands could probably do it I don't

4663.38 --> 4667.76
think they'd get the space to do it

4665.6 --> 4672.02
though

4667.76 --> 4674.4800000000005
but it's it's funny idea maybe we could

4672.02 --> 4677.179
have like a big tunnel

4674.48 --> 4678.86
just like with France it would be much

4677.179 --> 4680.96
faster distance though and that would

4678.86 --> 4684.5199999999995
bring a lot of risks but maybe we could

4680.96 --> 4684.52
have a tunnel as well

4685.34 --> 4691.96
but that would be very long term very

4688.52 --> 4691.96
expensive project I think

4697.28 --> 4700.0
who knows

4705.64 --> 4710.360000000001
reclaim the North Sea okay

4712.94 --> 4716.86
right but yeah before we go into any

4715.94 --> 4719.839999999999
supposed

4716.86 --> 4722.839999999999
agreement to separate and then join

4719.84 --> 4725.78
England maybe England should like take

4722.84 --> 4728.12
care of its current situation first

4725.78 --> 4730.84
before we go and join up with you if you

4728.12 --> 4730.84
know what I mean

4731.3 --> 4734.92
let's

4732.62 --> 4739.58
overcome this

4734.92 --> 4743.1990000000005
Corona Eugenics nonsense first right in

4739.58 --> 4743.199
which England is one of the worst

4743.719 --> 4748.58
except maybe for like Australia and New

4746.42 --> 4751.58
Zealand or in Canada

4748.58 --> 4753.92
that are even worse

4751.58 --> 4756.739
it is very typical because who were they

4753.92 --> 4761.06
related to originally yeah so yeah

4756.739 --> 4763.5199999999995
England is getting it and personally

4761.06 --> 4765.92
not that I am like a

4763.52 --> 4768.14
genuine

4765.92 --> 4770.84
per a person that has genuine government

4768.14 --> 4773.0
function oversight and all that

4770.84 --> 4775.46
I wouldn't really want to join up with

4773.0 --> 4777.739
England in the current state it is in

4775.46 --> 4781.04
right

4777.739 --> 4783.379999999999
team with India yeah yeah in a way yeah

4781.04 --> 4785.84
India was a colony and it is getting it

4783.38 --> 4789.58
too it's like almost everywhere where

4785.84 --> 4789.58
England seems to have touched

4791.06 --> 4798.7390000000005
the vaccine autocracy is is seems to be

4795.02 --> 4801.5
the worst in these places

4798.739 --> 4803.659
it's bizarre

4801.5 --> 4805.82
but that seems to be how it's being

4803.659 --> 4808.5199999999995
rolled out

4805.82 --> 4810.139
where did the flu go it's still there

4808.52 --> 4813.400000000001
they just

4810.139 --> 4813.400000000001
don't care anymore

4823.159 --> 4826.759999999999
uh what is it return to normal you

4825.38 --> 4829.6
should be so lucky you should be so

4826.76 --> 4829.6
lucky what is it

4853.4 --> 4856.179
foreign

4882.38 --> 4887.3
I don't understand your question CBS

4916.719 --> 4923.9
I don't know about that Daffy Duck

4920.96 --> 4925.719
I really don't but yeah whatever is

4923.9 --> 4929.739
coming over in England

4925.719 --> 4933.9800000000005
migrant wise they are literally invited

4929.739 --> 4936.58
literally invited yeah

4933.98 --> 4936.58
so

4940.1 --> 4946.46
right if you want to stop that then make

4943.639 --> 4949.04
the invite stop first yeah you got to go

4946.46 --> 4951.86
to your Little Queenie for that she's

4949.04 --> 4954.56
the one that's handing out the invite

4951.86 --> 4956.78
yeah like blatantly

4954.56 --> 4960.1990000000005
so as long as she

4956.78 --> 4962.599999999999
has that invite open nothing is going to

4960.199 --> 4964.339999999999
stop the influx nothing there's nothing

4962.6 --> 4968.6
you can do

4964.34 --> 4970.04
until the official invite is halted

4968.6 --> 4972.679
right

4970.04 --> 4976.04
it's that simple there's nothing you can

4972.679 --> 4979.219
do about it no manner of complaining an

4976.04 --> 4982.9
outrage is going to stop it until the

4979.219 --> 4982.9
invite is retracted

4990.739 --> 4993.04
foreign

4997.12 --> 5000.229
[Music]

5003.28 --> 5010.0
it's all a scam

5005.8 --> 5011.139
it's all making you believe it is

5010.0 --> 5015.34
necessary

5011.139 --> 5018.639
it isn't it isn't even legal it's all a

5015.34 --> 5021.9400000000005
scam it's all just trying to ride a wave

5018.639 --> 5024.04
of suspensive disbelief after massive

5021.94 --> 5028.54
amounts of programming

5024.04 --> 5032.0199999999995
and isolation torture

5028.54 --> 5035.28
through the lockdowns through blurting

5032.02 --> 5035.280000000001
out fear porn

5036.159 --> 5041.08
all a scam

5038.02 --> 5043.320000000001
it's not legal they can't actually do

5041.08 --> 5043.32
that

5043.78 --> 5049.239
but they can talk about it endlessly

5046.42 --> 5051.46
until you refrain from doing things

5049.239 --> 5054.339999999999
because you are afraid you'll be asked

5051.46 --> 5056.86
for a CV passport which you don't have

5054.34 --> 5058.02
and don't want to have it's part of what

5056.86 --> 5063.099999999999
they do

5058.02 --> 5066.6990000000005
all above all of it it's all a bluff

5063.1 --> 5071.139
a bluff a fraud not actual

5066.699 --> 5074.86
not actually legal it's all fake

5071.139 --> 5076.3
pure suggestion pure suggestion

5074.86 --> 5079.839999999999
manipulation

5076.3 --> 5082.42
you are being treated like cattle and

5079.84 --> 5085.360000000001
they're waving this stick at you

5082.42 --> 5087.54
it makes you nervous right but it's a

5085.36 --> 5087.54
stick

5087.82 --> 5091.0199999999995
it's just a stick

5091.84 --> 5096.88
the stick is not gonna kill you you

5094.96 --> 5099.94
understand

5096.88 --> 5102.58
but it'll it'll drive you in a direction

5099.94 --> 5105.04
that stick the stick can never kill you

5102.58 --> 5108.3
though they can't do it it's like

5105.04 --> 5108.3
physically impossible

5108.88 --> 5114.400000000001
ever tried like

5110.56 --> 5118.179
taking just a stick right a wooden stick

5114.4 --> 5120.94
and try to kill a bull with that

5118.179 --> 5123.76
good luck with that man like even if you

5120.94 --> 5125.919999999999
like make a point at it turn it into a

5123.76 --> 5129.159000000001
spear that's still going to be extremely

5125.92 --> 5131.1990000000005
difficult right now imagine a whole

5129.159 --> 5132.46
bunch of cows in a pen

5131.199 --> 5135.099999999999
right

5132.46 --> 5137.199
yeah they will move away when you start

5135.1 --> 5140.1
waving the stick maybe slapping them on

5137.199 --> 5140.099999999999
the ass and all that

5140.26 --> 5146.9800000000005
they don't realize is they could never

5143.08 --> 5148.719
die from that stick right that's what's

5146.98 --> 5151.48
happening right now with Humanity

5148.719 --> 5153.58
they're waving the stick at you until

5151.48 --> 5155.5
you've covered passport you can't get

5153.58 --> 5157.0
anywhere without a girlfriend but it's

5155.5 --> 5159.699
all a bluff

5157.0 --> 5161.98
all of it is a bluff they can't do

5159.699 --> 5165.48
anything they can only

5161.98 --> 5169.259999999999
make you believe you have no choice

5165.48 --> 5169.259999999999
that's all they're doing

5183.34 --> 5188.02
right good old cattle prod okay yeah

5185.86 --> 5191.92
that's been a little bit rougher than a

5188.02 --> 5195.52
stick but like even a cattle prod

5191.92 --> 5197.5
a cow or a stair cannot die from a

5195.52 --> 5198.88
cattle prod yeah it could hurt it like

5197.5 --> 5201.88
[ __ ]

5198.88 --> 5205.06
well maybe if you hit the cow in the in

5201.88 --> 5207.6990000000005
the wrong spot and yeah like zap it in

5205.06 --> 5210.34
the head or something continually

5207.699 --> 5212.5599999999995
but it's extremely tough though

5210.34 --> 5216.04
right especially if you realize there's

5212.56 --> 5218.1990000000005
a whole bunch of them in the same spot

5216.04 --> 5220.42
well you might be prodding one but if

5218.199 --> 5223.48
another like steer gets it in his mind

5220.42 --> 5225.46
he'll just like go at you and like

5223.48 --> 5227.138999999999
spare you with his horns or whatever

5225.46 --> 5231.699
right

5227.139 --> 5233.32
there's no way it's all a bluff it's all

5231.699 --> 5236.86
a bluff

5233.32 --> 5241.36
they can't actually do anything they can

5236.86 --> 5242.679
only Mesmerize you into you doing it to

5241.36 --> 5244.44
yourself

5242.679 --> 5247.6
it's the primary

5244.44 --> 5251.339999999999
exclusive tactic here they can't

5247.6 --> 5251.34
actually Force anything

5266.139 --> 5269.58
so stop squirting

5270.82 --> 5274.32
stop being afraid

5280.54 --> 5284.88
okay Inconvenient Truth sure

5285.04 --> 5290.32
I mean let's quickly move on to other

5287.02 --> 5294.1
ridiculous ideas to fare over and be all

5290.32 --> 5295.719
nervous about right you need your fear

5294.1 --> 5298.96
yeah that's because you've been

5295.719 --> 5303.699
conditioned to be used to

5298.96 --> 5305.679
needing fare yeah so oh oh a nonsense

5303.699 --> 5308.0199999999995
fear spell just got this spelled oh

5305.679 --> 5311.86
you'll quickly move on to some other

5308.02 --> 5314.320000000001
crazy idea then yeah oh oh let's oh the

5311.86 --> 5316.839999999999
Queens are reptile oh no let's squirt

5314.32 --> 5318.28
over that right that's called squirt

5316.84 --> 5320.62
addiction

5318.28 --> 5323.8
you're addicted to Fair

5320.62 --> 5327.599999999999
you got used to it too much

5323.8 --> 5327.6
and then you start kneading it

5328.36 --> 5333.48
watch that video which one clutch bear

5334.48 --> 5336.659
foreign

5341.86 --> 5344.82
how are you doing girl

5372.58 --> 5376.96
cool

5374.44 --> 5379.48
well remember that

5376.96 --> 5381.94
don't take it too personal when you kind

5379.48 --> 5384.459999999999
of ram it in on you

5381.94 --> 5385.419999999999
I'm just here to warn you to try to help

5384.46 --> 5386.7390000000005
you

5385.42 --> 5389.62
see

5386.739 --> 5392.32
what it is you're engaged in

5389.62 --> 5395.739
in order for you to be able to decide to

5392.32 --> 5398.199
take control back from that effect

5395.739 --> 5400.0
right so sometimes I might sound a

5398.199 --> 5403.419999999999
little rough don't take it personal it's

5400.0 --> 5404.98
not meant like that and I'm just being

5403.42 --> 5408.36
alarmist

5404.98 --> 5408.36
about it that's all

5416.46 --> 5421.54
is everything he has said has

5418.719 --> 5422.86
unfortunately happening that's great

5421.54 --> 5424.84
English but

5422.86 --> 5428.099999999999
really everything he said is

5424.84 --> 5428.1
unfortunately happening

5430.3 --> 5433.26
I don't know

5434.44 --> 5442.0
what he has been predicted predicting

5437.739 --> 5444.4
though were very rough outlines

5442.0 --> 5447.219
that were always going to be a theme

5444.4 --> 5449.5
they were a theme back then and they are

5447.219 --> 5451.3
even more a theme right now right

5449.5 --> 5453.159
everything he describes about the

5451.3 --> 5455.139
Consciousness and how they keep you in

5453.159 --> 5458.259999999999
this bubble and everything the prison of

5455.139 --> 5461.32
your own mind yeah that absolutely was

5458.26 --> 5464.62
like Cornerstone staple

5461.32 --> 5468.04
knowledge that is even more valuable

5464.62 --> 5470.08
today as it is back then

5468.04 --> 5472.98
I wouldn't say that all his predictions

5470.08 --> 5472.98
came true though

5473.32 --> 5481.96
but hey he has read the same documents

5478.6 --> 5483.76
as Alex Jones has like they're on the

5481.96 --> 5486.88
same team like that

5483.76 --> 5488.5
a lot of look all these things of boo

5486.88 --> 5490.32
prediction predictions well a lot of

5488.5 --> 5494.38
people that make these predictions

5490.32 --> 5496.9
literally have the papers to back it up

5494.38 --> 5499.2390000000005
the bigger issue is is that the majority

5496.9 --> 5501.94
of the public can't believe that the

5499.239 --> 5505.0
people actually executing these crazy

5501.94 --> 5508.259999999999
tyrannical actions in the world write

5505.0 --> 5511.78
their papers decades ahead of time

5508.26 --> 5513.400000000001
that's the part that people can get

5511.78 --> 5515.86
through to their heads they can't

5513.4 --> 5517.42
understand how that is possible

5515.86 --> 5519.5199999999995
they forget about and then they just

5517.42 --> 5521.02
said oh these people predicted it

5519.52 --> 5523.0
they're so good because they saw

5521.02 --> 5525.34
everything ahead of time well these

5523.0 --> 5528.52
people that predicted it literally say

5525.34 --> 5531.6990000000005
look this is where I got it from they

5528.52 --> 5534.2390000000005
wrote it down it's right there

5531.699 --> 5534.239
right

5535.06 --> 5541.4800000000005
and I figured that out very quickly that

5537.639 --> 5546.28
is partially why I very eager to follow

5541.48 --> 5549.5199999999995
Alex Jones early on from 2010 eight

5546.28 --> 5554.139
on pretty much because he was

5549.52 --> 5556.84
bringing out the documents a lot

5554.139 --> 5558.46
and even when he did it there were some

5556.84 --> 5560.5
parts that were where I was just like

5558.46 --> 5562.3
there's no way that could happen there's

5560.5 --> 5564.76
no way people would fall for that that

5562.3 --> 5565.78
it can't work

5564.76 --> 5569.56
um

5565.78 --> 5572.0199999999995
did reality show me or what yeah yeah it

5569.56 --> 5574.6
can work it happened exactly like that

5572.02 --> 5575.92
and sometimes it feels like it's even

5574.6 --> 5580.360000000001
worse

5575.92 --> 5582.96
than they originally predict projected

5580.36 --> 5582.96
because

5583.12 --> 5590.199
people that see it coming that let it

5586.9 --> 5592.659
happen even try to cook unnecessarily

5590.199 --> 5597.5199999999995
much towards it

5592.659 --> 5601.54
like just as a pure slave surrenderism

5597.52 --> 5604.5
towards autocratic anti-human takeover

5601.54 --> 5604.5
that part

5605.92 --> 5612.46
has not been as much predicted

5609.52 --> 5614.4400000000005
but it was inevitable it just seems like

5612.46 --> 5617.139
it's

5614.44 --> 5619.719
it's worse than we thought or than I

5617.139 --> 5622.12
thought but then again yeah I

5619.719 --> 5624.88
overestimate

5622.12 --> 5626.739
people's ability to

5624.88 --> 5628.36
to grow out of

5626.739 --> 5631.178999999999
slavery

5628.36 --> 5634.299999999999
I've overestimated that ability

5631.179 --> 5637.139
I've underestimated people's ability to

5634.3 --> 5637.139
be delusional

5647.739 --> 5656.28
are vampires real I don't know

5651.159 --> 5656.28
depends on exactly what you mean by that

5660.88 --> 5666.04
I think that a lot of the vampire lore

5663.4 --> 5668.08
has truth to it and there are probably

5666.04 --> 5670.32
people out there with that sort of

5668.08 --> 5670.32
condition

5674.86 --> 5678.48
the bad ones

5679.84 --> 5686.219
so all vampires are bad

5682.719 --> 5686.219
they're freaking Undead

5694.0 --> 5699.34
what typically defines a vampire and is

5696.94 --> 5701.799999999999
widely overlooked is they don't have

5699.34 --> 5705.28
normal human instincts

5701.8 --> 5707.34
right that makes them not human right

5705.28 --> 5710.92
now it doesn't really matter what

5707.34 --> 5713.02
physiological aspects they have

5710.92 --> 5715.119
the fact remains is what typically

5713.02 --> 5717.639
defines a vampire is that they don't

5715.119 --> 5719.5
have normal human instincts which makes

5717.639 --> 5721.3
them not human

5719.5 --> 5722.92
makes them evil

5721.3 --> 5727.96
unnatural

5722.92 --> 5730.5
away from the the god-given natural path

5727.96 --> 5730.5
right

5736.96 --> 5741.1
don't worry

5738.46 --> 5743.7390000000005
we could have a conspiracy can't stop

5741.1 --> 5746.5
wasting my time with your nonsense

5743.739 --> 5751.739
please I'm talking about real things

5746.5 --> 5751.739
yeah go back to your Ghost Story Hour

5754.199 --> 5758.638999999999
hey vampires they're so needy

5766.42 --> 5772.32
I used to be one

5769.36 --> 5772.32
got better

5775.28 --> 5778.469999999999
[Music]

5782.82 --> 5785.96
[Music]

5797.92 --> 5804.46

5800.44 --> 5807.36
it I know what you talk about is lame it

5804.46 --> 5807.36
almost has to be

5808.42 --> 5814.119
like I don't even need to watch a thing

5811.6 --> 5817.320000000001
about it to know that it cannot be

5814.119 --> 5821.38
anything other than lame conspiracy cats

5817.32 --> 5825.58
it's you it's ranty

5821.38 --> 5828.78
it's what you do you can't help it it's

5825.58 --> 5828.78

5837.94 --> 5843.159
right well there you go

5840.28 --> 5845.199
even more [ __ ]

5843.159 --> 5848.879999999999

5845.199 --> 5848.879999999999
BBC actually wants you

5849.639 --> 5853.139
that's disgusting dude

5856.179 --> 5860.219
like literally disgusting

5864.159 --> 5871.5
I remember the good old days when BBC

5866.739 --> 5873.099999999999
actually had halfway decent Leading Edge

5871.5 --> 5875.739
documentaries

5873.1 --> 5877.4800000000005
they were like the pride

5875.739 --> 5879.459999999999
of the West

5877.48 --> 5883.718999999999
because of the quality documentaries

5879.46 --> 5887.619
that they made now it's the worst

5883.719 --> 5890.139
most disgusting woke piece of [ __ ]

5887.619 --> 5892.599999999999
autocratic

5890.139 --> 5894.6990000000005
bunch of scumbags

5892.6 --> 5898.3
the West knows it's like one of the

5894.699 --> 5901.96
worst propaganda centers in the west the

5898.3 --> 5903.88
BBC absolutely atrocious

5901.96 --> 5906.34
and Criminal

5903.88 --> 5908.619
right it's not just disgusting they're

5906.34 --> 5913.56
also Criminal

5908.619 --> 5913.5599999999995
very very criminal yeah

5917.92 --> 5922.619
they are like the Nazis

5922.659 --> 5932.32
they act like the Nazis did in Germany

5926.86 --> 5932.32
in the early stage propaganda villanary

5932.34 --> 5937.5
corruption

5934.02 --> 5941.159000000001
unbelievable corruption and just blatant

5937.5 --> 5945.48
anti-human greed and [ __ ]

5941.159 --> 5948.219
constantly obsessed with some stupid

5945.48 --> 5951.218999999999
degenerate narrative

5948.219 --> 5951.219
disgusting

5957.9 --> 5962.92
yeah stop wasting my time conspiracy

5960.88 --> 5964.719
cats I'm not interested I'm not going to

5962.92 --> 5966.82
make a show with you

5964.719 --> 5968.8
I'm not gonna talk about what you're

5966.82 --> 5970.84
talking about this show has been great

5968.8 --> 5972.34
without you and I'm gonna keep it that

5970.84 --> 5974.619000000001
way

5972.34 --> 5977.46

5974.619 --> 5977.46

5979.719 --> 5985.679
It's Not Gonna air on the BBC anyway so

5982.54 --> 5985.679
why would I give a [ __ ]

5986.5 --> 5991.179
I'm not going to go through the same

5988.84 --> 5993.6990000000005
route as Mark sergeant

5991.179 --> 5996.159
being like oh oh look we got a flat

5993.699 --> 5998.799999999999
earther we got a flat Earth there oh

5996.159 --> 6001.92
that means that we can edit the [ __ ] out

5998.8 --> 6004.9800000000005
of it until we can maximize

6001.92 --> 6008.219
the level of ridiculous ridiculousness

6004.98 --> 6010.739
yeah I'm not going to be part of that

6008.219 --> 6013.679
I want I refuse

6010.739 --> 6017.099999999999
I don't need

6013.679 --> 6021.179
the viewership of the people that watch

6017.1 --> 6025.1990000000005
BBC yeah I don't want them to follow me

6021.179 --> 6026.82
if you watch BBC I don't want you get

6025.199 --> 6033.0
out of here

6026.82 --> 6036.599999999999
BBC is for woke retards and slaves

6033.0 --> 6038.159
death cult surrenderists I don't need

6036.6 --> 6040.820000000001
you here

6038.159 --> 6040.82
understand

6043.38 --> 6047.54
all right I'm going to round out the

6045.0 --> 6047.54
show I think

6058.199 --> 6062.5199999999995
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6060.719 --> 6065.4
like this show I thought it was

6062.52 --> 6069.42
surprisingly good actually

6065.4 --> 6070.86
and I'm very happy with how my title and

6069.42 --> 6073.679
everything came together in the story

6070.86 --> 6077.339999999999
again you do realize like I literally

6073.679 --> 6080.04
made up the title put it together a half

6077.34 --> 6083.1
an hour before I started the show which

6080.04 --> 6085.5
was a half hour after I woke up

6083.1 --> 6089.400000000001
I don't know how I got it to work like

6085.5 --> 6091.5
this but it worked I love it so maybe I

6089.4 --> 6093.48
can actually keep this up every single

6091.5 --> 6095.58
day

6093.48 --> 6097.919999999999
I'm going to try

6095.58 --> 6101.0
because I'm really liking the way this

6097.92 --> 6101.0
is working out so far

6101.699 --> 6108.599999999999
thank you PJ Cree shank

6105.44 --> 6110.339999999999
I really appreciate that thank you very

6108.6 --> 6113.159000000001
much

6110.34 --> 6116.159000000001
and Dusty Riders

6113.159 --> 6118.0199999999995
lots of new crew return to normal

6116.159 --> 6119.58
I think that a whole bunch of people are

6118.02 --> 6122.1
probably going to get some wrenches in

6119.58 --> 6124.139
the near future

6122.1 --> 6126.659000000001
anyway thank you very much for your

6124.139 --> 6129.2390000000005
participation in chat which is as you

6126.659 --> 6132.36
all know by now critical for the

6129.239 --> 6134.159
functioning of my show no chat means no

6132.36 --> 6135.9
conversations

6134.159 --> 6138.96
because I

6135.9 --> 6141.299999999999
mostly am a blank slate I mean all in

6138.96 --> 6144.0
all what I actually talk about during

6141.3 --> 6145.860000000001
the show that is not directly derived

6144.0 --> 6147.96
from chat

6145.86 --> 6150.119
I think that in the two-hour show that's

6147.96 --> 6153.36
maybe like 20 minutes all together Max

6150.119 --> 6155.28
and then I'm kind of like done this

6153.36 --> 6159.08
then I've just said everything I needed

6155.28 --> 6159.08
to say that's usually how things end up

6165.84 --> 6170.159000000001
all right anyway

6167.58 --> 6172.5599999999995
