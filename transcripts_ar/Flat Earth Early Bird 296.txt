6.45 --> 36.52
[Music]

36.53 --> 43.620000000000005
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.38 --> 45.300000000000004
early-bird number 296 I'm your host

43.62 --> 46.8
Arwen and before I start to show please

45.3 --> 49.05
don't forget to share it on any platform

46.8 --> 50.73
you deem fit and I'll say if you haven't

49.05 --> 52.41
already subscribed to my channel and hit

50.73 --> 54.48
the bell notifications so you know when

52.41 --> 57.3
I'm going live which is normally two

54.48 --> 59.76
p.m. m same time every day also please

57.3 --> 63.9
do support me through the paypal patreon

59.76 --> 68.78999999999999
my GoFundMe and super chats that would

63.9 --> 70.59
be much appreciated so today again it's

68.79 --> 75.78
pretty fresh it's not as bad as

70.59 --> 80.52000000000001
yesterday like yesterday I had a pretty

75.78 --> 88.04
crazy day yesterday it's still some blue

80.52 --> 88.03999999999999
in there but it's pretty fresh

90.38 --> 97.47
yeah I actually went out on the bike

94.02 --> 101.22
four times yesterday in tow and that

97.47 --> 105.27
last time there was well maybe more was

101.22 --> 108.42
a mistake I guess because I just went

105.27 --> 113.14999999999999
going back I got caught in this really

108.42 --> 118.29
big bucket of water being spilled over

113.15 --> 124.28
wasn't that pleasant experience but yeah

118.29 --> 124.28
well I got to Mara coffee with me today

125.15 --> 138.08
nice and T so let's see who is in chat

134.27 --> 146.51000000000002
Steve there first

138.08 --> 152.07000000000002
hm Amanda you Sarita Cosentino Sarita

146.51 --> 157.44
stone monkey 3d random Randy flat earth

152.07 --> 163.67
a matrix media yeah good to see you all

157.44 --> 163.67
ah hey Rasta

164.71 --> 172.61
yeah you must be a pretty late or are

169.76 --> 176.6
you up very early which one is it Resta

172.61 --> 179.98000000000002
probably very early right or very late

176.6 --> 182.6
it's 5 o'clock over there something

179.98 --> 185.32
anyway the Me's Kang

182.6 --> 185.32
let's see you

189.4 --> 194.74
so

191.47 --> 194.74
let's see

195.84 --> 210.239
oh yeah let's start off with some

199.91 --> 218.239
positive news I think it's a it's a good

210.239 --> 218.239
lead let's see let me present this I

218.66 --> 227.60999999999999
posted the link in the early bird chat

221.4 --> 233.73000000000002
some of you may have had a look it's a

227.61 --> 238.65
natural news article and it seems a

233.73 --> 241.7
couple of pretty ingenious scientists in

238.65 --> 247.37900000000002
diverse wealth speculators engineers

241.7 --> 253.04899999999998
solution finders you know they

247.379 --> 255.12
apparently figured out to use or they've

253.049 --> 258.69
yeah they figured out that jellyfish

255.12 --> 261.359
yeah they have a certain substance as

258.69 --> 265.13
part of them the gooey part that they

261.359 --> 269.43
secrete as part of the a covering

265.13 --> 274.61
protecting themselves it apparently has

269.43 --> 274.61
a very strong tendency to collect

274.88 --> 280.349
microplastics microplastics are a big

277.95 --> 282.81
problem right now in the world in the

280.349 --> 285.3
oceans one of the problems that you

282.81 --> 288.72
don't really find any solutions to so

285.3 --> 293.27000000000004
far just gets worse but apparently they

288.72 --> 296.84900000000005
figured out okay these jellyfish mucus

293.27 --> 303.45
they they collect that so they're gonna

296.849 --> 306.81
try to use well kind of like as water

303.45 --> 314.28
lilies would be used in stale water to

306.81 --> 316.289
filter out feces and all that and very

314.28 --> 319.85999999999996
disgusting things so they would

316.289 --> 322.289
basically start to apply jellyfish to

319.86 --> 326.08000000000004
filter out micro plastics and then they

322.289 --> 330.909
have to harvest them again

326.08 --> 335.15
that may be the way they're gonna do it

330.909 --> 336.74
or maybe a more industrial application

335.15 --> 340.18899999999996
of the stuff I don't know what exactly

336.74 --> 343.43
they're planning but this is good news

340.189 --> 345.62
again another amazing solution just

343.43 --> 348.68
found in the creatures already here

345.62 --> 351.069
present on this earth creation is

348.68 --> 351.069
ingenious

352.24 --> 363.71000000000004
right so yeah I've thought that was some

356.629 --> 366.969
good news you check it out put out the

363.71 --> 366.969
link in the chat earlier

370.4 --> 374.57
so that made me kind of happy

385.939 --> 390.509
well Nathan whatever advertisements

388.919 --> 397.469
gonna pop up is going to be attuned

390.509 --> 399.93
specifically to to the viewer and what

397.469 --> 407.099
the algorithm wants the viewer to be

399.93 --> 409.439
confronted with when watching me so that

407.099 --> 414.719
could either be a giant distraction or

409.439 --> 416.90900000000005
something that really attunes to the

414.719 --> 420.9
atmosphere it is alled it all depends on

416.909 --> 424.08
what the algorithm has planned for each

420.9 --> 427.339
individual in the face of approaching me

424.08 --> 430.339
and it works with everyone like that I

427.339 --> 430.339
think

436.729 --> 443.62899999999996
spero music thought you couldn't trust

439.52 --> 446.74899999999997
scientists look these are yeah they call

443.629 --> 451.46000000000004
it scientists okay because natural news

446.749 --> 453.46900000000005
like so many used the scientists and it

451.46 --> 456.08
all depends on what it is they're

453.469 --> 458.80899999999997
actually talking about or doing or

456.08 --> 461.3
planning that reveals whether it's

458.809 --> 463.129
pseudoscience nonsense and speculation

461.3 --> 466.58
and there is some in-between there

463.129 --> 471.11
because yeah on that side there's even

466.58 --> 474.08
sometimes some alien relating ideas or

471.11 --> 477.529
speculations or philosophy in there and

474.08 --> 481.12899999999996
then I call it out sometimes I did last

477.529 --> 483.169
time got a big support for that agree

481.129 --> 484.999
that scientists didn't apply any

483.169 --> 487.43
scientific method in that case we

484.999 --> 488.53900000000004
concerning the aliens but with this it's

487.43 --> 495.069
very practical

488.539 --> 500.68899999999996
it's just field research it's is it

495.069 --> 506.659
anthropology just looking for properties

500.689 --> 509.18
in animals and then yeah figuring out an

506.659 --> 511.459
industrial application you find a

509.18 --> 516.139
property you need for something specific

511.459 --> 518.8
and then you try to utilize that it's

516.139 --> 522.05
more engineering it or engineering

518.8 --> 524.8389999999999
utilizing nature's resources so maybe

522.05 --> 529.0
you could call it bioengineering but

524.839 --> 529.0
it's not literally genetic editing so

537.49 --> 543.259
so it doesn't really matter in the end

539.99 --> 547.12
if they call it scientists they describe

543.259 --> 551.1990000000001
exactly the properties of something and

547.12 --> 551.199
then try to use it

554.77 --> 557.5799999999999
yeah

558.55 --> 564.31
so Nathan oh that's interesting

561.76 --> 568.0
maybe the ad and the algorithm was

564.31 --> 570.2199999999999
basically trying to tell you hey why

568.0 --> 573.7
don't you get back to your old job

570.22 --> 575.65
Nathan maybe that's what the algorithm

573.7 --> 577.63
is trying to tell you maybe maybe the

575.65 --> 581.68
algorithm doesn't really like you and

577.63 --> 587.65
your show that much I wonder what that

581.68 --> 589.81
would be right Nathan but I'm pretty

587.65 --> 593.7099999999999
sure the algorithm is very much aware

589.81 --> 596.17
that you are the one in control of your

593.71 --> 599.88
show so that will count whatever you do

596.17 --> 602.9799999999999
on the Internet is accounted for and

599.88 --> 606.55
drawn into the overall decision making

602.98 --> 610.72
us to your designation within the web of

606.55 --> 618.1899999999999
everything what the algorithm is gonna

610.72 --> 620.23
make as choices for you I've been

618.19 --> 624.1
noticing that for for a very long time

620.23 --> 627.01
just too many coincidence and it's so

624.1 --> 628.99
weird because when you constantly get

627.01 --> 631.71
these coincidences you kind of get used

628.99 --> 636.12
to it and you forget that that's

631.71 --> 638.6800000000001
supposed to be a coincidence you just

636.12 --> 640.96
you get Mesmer then you start to take it

638.68 --> 643.8299999999999
for granted well it's not it's

640.96 --> 643.83
programming you

650.48 --> 655.279
probably by trying to get you in a

652.86 --> 659.22
certain wavelength of your mind

655.279 --> 662.699
hypnotizing you just through association

659.22 --> 665.0690000000001
conditioning and then just doing

662.699 --> 669.1099999999999
something giving a nudge in the

665.069 --> 669.11
direction that's not even that apparent

669.949 --> 677.6099999999999
the algorithm knows how humans function

673.589 --> 681.0290000000001
way better than we truly understand it

677.61 --> 683.009
knows the the amounts the percentages of

681.029 --> 687.259
all the things that we just roughly

683.009 --> 687.259
speculate about I'm pretty sure of that

690.44 --> 696.5290000000001
just all the brain testing where do you

693.269 --> 696.529
think all that information goes

699.319 --> 708.5999999999999
information reflexes cymatics all that

704.42 --> 712.519
is full access to all of it in full

708.6 --> 712.519
clarity unlike humans

717.91 --> 733.5799999999999
anyway let's see what went down

722.72 --> 738.64
yesterday so flattered debates then this

733.58 --> 744.8000000000001
idiot troll over in this Court

738.64 --> 747.29
started to accuse us was it again of the

744.8 --> 750.17
edge of claiming the edge that was so

747.29 --> 752.7099999999999
bizarre how hard he doubled down in that

750.17 --> 755.4499999999999
[ __ ] and then Nathan went ballistic

752.71 --> 760.64
that's kind of when I left I started to

755.45 --> 762.11
do my newspaper rounds and yeah I missed

760.64 --> 765.4
the rest of the show so I don't know

762.11 --> 765.4
what happened after that point

779.35 --> 782.9200000000001
oh I went over to Martin let kids watch

782.38 --> 785.23
that

782.92 --> 790.66
oh yeah I watched some of Martin leeches

785.23 --> 793.38
on Randy's as well was okay I didn't

790.66 --> 793.38
watch all of it

802.4 --> 807.5799999999999
hey [ __ ] Jews long time no see

821.72 --> 827.12
right oh yeah the whole brexit issue

824.57 --> 830.6500000000001
Andrew brought that I've almost forgot

827.12 --> 830.65
about that yeah that's crazy man

831.52 --> 838.5799999999999
so that's kind of weird

835.28 --> 841.1
Alex Jones yeah I remember I mentioned

838.58 --> 845.0
it okay I know I mentioned it on the

841.1 --> 848.36
debates it's a few days ago half a week

845.0 --> 850.58
or something it certainly was brought up

848.36 --> 853.63
that on the Alex Jones Show that

850.58 --> 859.45
supposedly the British Parliament was

853.63 --> 862.85
suspending the government over brexit

859.45 --> 865.1600000000001
and at first I thought like what didn't

862.85 --> 871.5500000000001
really see much of it but now it's just

865.16 --> 874.16
shining through everywhere and yeah it's

871.55 --> 881.65
a pretty crazy situation it's literally

874.16 --> 885.0799999999999
the Queen just taking away the the

881.65 --> 888.55
freedoms again in a way it in the face

885.08 --> 895.01
of this that is exactly what that is

888.55 --> 897.5
it's kind of unnerving that they would

895.01 --> 899.83
do that I wonder where this will go from

897.5 --> 899.83
here on

905.25 --> 912.85
all right so I don't know I don't know

912.04 --> 916.7099999999999
what happened

912.85 --> 921.16
I wonder maybe they could yeah I could

916.71 --> 924.0
think of all kinds of things like like

921.16 --> 932.5899999999999
there could be like a serious Parliament

924.0 --> 935.23
revolution almost like she's at some

932.59 --> 938.59
East Asian countries sometimes have like

935.23 --> 940.84
very serious like physical fights and

938.59 --> 942.5400000000001
throwing books around and [ __ ] maybe

940.84 --> 945.3100000000001
it'll come to that

942.54 --> 947.68
it'll just like the tension will just

945.31 --> 952.0799999999999
rise to high and everybody's pissed off

947.68 --> 952.0799999999999
and this

955.2 --> 962.339
yes here for lols that's pretty much

958.589 --> 966.2
what it seems to be like but it's also

962.339 --> 969.12
laid out why of course because I it's

966.2 --> 978.87
it's like a bad break up no matter what

969.12 --> 981.0600000000001
really but to just ignore it is and at

978.87 --> 986.91
this moment it's just a terrible stance

981.06 --> 989.91
to take it's like the breaking of a

986.91 --> 993.51
trust from the people because they voted

989.91 --> 995.519
in a certain way and was official and

993.51 --> 997.98
then now they're backtracking is just

995.519 --> 1001.67
makes it all look fake all just

997.98 --> 1004.6700000000001
ceremonial and with suspending the

1001.67 --> 1015.38
Parliament well that ceremonial nurse is

1004.67 --> 1022.269
just enhanced even further yeah I know

1015.38 --> 1028.91
not the Queen just the the nobility D

1022.269 --> 1031.99
order it is officially the Queen it's

1028.91 --> 1031.99
still a kingdom you know

1036.09 --> 1041.27
that's how its founded that's how it's

1038.52 --> 1041.27
set up still

1051.6 --> 1058.7199999999998
yeah

1054.41 --> 1058.72
same goes for Netherlands by the way

1068.72 --> 1073.73
and we have a lot of our own issues by

1071.84 --> 1075.7099999999998
the way in the Netherlands because I

1073.73 --> 1080.47
have kind of gazed at it from the

1075.71 --> 1080.47
sidelines and not so much commenting

1083.83 --> 1086.83
yeah

1089.43 --> 1094.13
what's what's the problem CGI Rati

1106.93 --> 1121.1100000000001
okay all right

1112.05 --> 1121.11
so let's see what could we talk about

1138.36 --> 1150.6899999999998
oh that's easy Pannalal relative density

1143.85 --> 1152.25
disequilibrium the differential to in

1150.69 --> 1155.8200000000002
the densities in the spectrum of all

1152.25 --> 1162.049
things within the confines of the realm

1155.82 --> 1162.049
the spatially limited convice

1171.8 --> 1174.96
[Applause]

1175.04 --> 1178.099
[Music]

1190.22 --> 1192.909
hmm

1211.96 --> 1219.929
whoa MB what is your issue man the [ __ ]

1221.84 --> 1227.389
I remember you whining for days about

1225.08 --> 1228.259
how I had locked you in my chat and you

1227.389 --> 1230.299
didn't deserve that

1228.259 --> 1235.609
and now you're pulling that one out

1230.299 --> 1242.2
really I'm a I'm a propagandist

1235.609 --> 1246.9089999999999
for what what giant group am i

1242.2 --> 1249.919
propagandizing you know I don't even I

1246.909 --> 1252.3990000000001
don't even go with the disk model with

1249.919 --> 1255.3200000000002
the dome I don't even go with that and

1252.399 --> 1259.57
that's the vast majority at this point

1255.32 --> 1259.57
so what the hell is your problem man

1280.21 --> 1291.429
well Fyodor Dostoevsky there I don't

1287.679 --> 1293.679
know there is certainly sizable amounts

1291.429 --> 1296.799
of people that do smoke cannabis here in

1293.679 --> 1300.1290000000001
the Netherlands I don't know

1296.799 --> 1303.73
look how are you gonna Google how many

1300.129 --> 1305.769
people illegally smoke because usually

1303.73 --> 1308.6490000000001
when people smoke it illegally they're

1305.769 --> 1311.139
not gonna throw it out there in risk of

1308.649 --> 1316.35
while getting the police and everything

1311.139 --> 1316.35
so that doesn't make a lot of sense

1327.03 --> 1333.51
but yeah if you're wondering like how is

1331.35 --> 1338.9599999999998
my cannabis smoking behavior compared to

1333.51 --> 1342.78
some others well I I guess that I do

1338.96 --> 1348.6000000000001
fall in like the category of the more

1342.78 --> 1349.41
smoking people because I do I haven't

1348.6 --> 1352.56
always been like that

1349.41 --> 1357.99
you know for example ten years ago

1352.56 --> 1361.05
I was much more sensitive to it all so

1357.99 --> 1362.79
it would also derail me more easily and

1361.05 --> 1365.76
there was a lot bigger issue back then

1362.79 --> 1370.2
because I didn't have that insight yet

1365.76 --> 1373.05
about it and I had a lot of hobbies by

1370.2 --> 1376.17
the way back then a lot of them also

1373.05 --> 1383.54
building the whole game D&D thing and

1376.17 --> 1383.54
everything a lot more goldsmithing but

1386.7 --> 1392.679
yeah now I do smoke more because it

1390.219 --> 1398.2
doesn't make that much of an impact and

1392.679 --> 1400.6290000000001
I do enjoy it a lot but I tries yeah I

1398.2 --> 1402.429
can still smoke too much you know it it

1400.629 --> 1404.379
doesn't really go away it just takes

1402.429 --> 1407.409
more to get there and I don't really

1404.379 --> 1410.309
like getting there done yeah being all

1407.409 --> 1410.3090000000002
knocked out by it

1410.399 --> 1418.9599999999998
yeah no CGI ranty it will not don't

1415.899 --> 1421.299
don't try to Gaslight me with that know

1418.96 --> 1425.739
exactly what it does to me already

1421.299 --> 1428.289
explained sometimes certain states and

1425.739 --> 1434.409
certain moods second especially when I'm

1428.289 --> 1439.83
more exhilarated than the first 5 to 15

1434.409 --> 1439.8300000000002
minutes there can be like a certain

1440.07 --> 1446.379
short moment we're more paranoid

1443.229 --> 1452.32
feelings will arise and all that but it

1446.379 --> 1454.4789999999998
goes away always never sticks it it used

1452.32 --> 1456.58
to stick way in the early days when it

1454.479 --> 1460.029
was very sensitive to it and then would

1456.58 --> 1463.149
cause problems but doesn't do that

1460.029 --> 1470.08
anymore so don't gas lat

1463.149 --> 1472.799
like me about that and I'm doing I'm

1470.08 --> 1472.799
doing fine

1478.82 --> 1485.779
right Ratner Stefan hey listen I know

1481.279 --> 1489.499
Bob made a video about me and Tony I was

1485.779 --> 1494.449
there and I know I did great it was good

1489.499 --> 1497.809
energy surprising enough I always like

1494.449 --> 1500.449
it when the ballers really do their

1497.809 --> 1505.6689999999999
their actual best and to suddenly become

1500.449 --> 1511.219
civil and outstanding because they can

1505.669 --> 1514.1490000000001
do that and it's really good when you

1511.219 --> 1517.309
can be part of that and a sensible part

1514.149 --> 1519.589
and that's what I kind of still like

1517.309 --> 1525.559
about that that's why I do join when I

1519.589 --> 1531.649
see that happening but yeah unless

1525.559 --> 1533.269
they're in that kind of state then yeah

1531.649 --> 1536.809
if they're not that it's not gonna be

1533.269 --> 1539.569
worth much because they're just going to

1536.809 --> 1541.459
be pooh-poohing down and you all the

1539.569 --> 1543.289
time and declaring that you don't know

1541.459 --> 1545.569
anything in blah blah you know how that

1543.289 --> 1550.069
goes that's a complete waste of time

1545.569 --> 1551.9289999999999
it's really annoying and unnecessary but

1550.069 --> 1555.729
they need it they needed to boost their

1551.929 --> 1555.729
own confidence in the face of us

1558.83 --> 1564.74
I don't know what that is grip Chris

1563.0 --> 1574.4
Madden I have no idea what that is

1564.74 --> 1577.15
golden milk okay well at least I got

1574.4 --> 1577.15
people engaging

1584.3 --> 1589.3
pan number all about

1594.51 --> 1601.21
hey don't get cocky with me okay don't

1598.539 --> 1602.62
put that toner I'm just gonna ban you if

1601.21 --> 1607.39
you want to have a conversation you're

1602.62 --> 1612.9399999999998
gonna have to sit down and don't throw

1607.39 --> 1615.0700000000002
that tone at me and B don't okay I'll

1612.94 --> 1617.41
talk about my model while you're gonna

1615.07 --> 1619.78
be in a timeout and just cool it down

1617.41 --> 1621.6100000000001
because it's really annoying I don't

1619.78 --> 1624.3999999999999
accept people talking to me like that in

1621.61 --> 1628.0
my channel okay I will answer your

1624.4 --> 1630.7
questions but I'm not gonna tolerate

1628.0 --> 1635.049
people acting like they own me or

1630.7 --> 1637.9
something okay thank you so about my

1635.049 --> 1641.5
model yes I have claimed that I do have

1637.9 --> 1645.5800000000002
a model and that model is not in the

1641.5 --> 1649.419
form of a totally calculated projection

1645.58 --> 1651.6689999999999
system within a computer 3d system okay

1649.419 --> 1657.64
not yet anyway though I've seen things

1651.669 --> 1660.5800000000002
that are very close to like - how -

1657.64 --> 1666.22
visualized it as well close to it and

1660.58 --> 1669.33
that would be the free energy as PJ

1666.22 --> 1673.63
loves to claim that I stole his moral

1669.33 --> 1675.789
ruble beam right well I came up with the

1673.63 --> 1679.0300000000002
rectangular looping model way before I

1675.789 --> 1681.34
met the we have found that guy's channel

1679.03 --> 1683.62
how what did I find it because somebody

1681.34 --> 1686.1399999999999
came to me and said well what you're

1683.62 --> 1688.8999999999999
talking about what you drew look at free

1686.14 --> 1691.24
energy it's almost exactly like that so

1688.9 --> 1695.14
I was like what the hell and then I went

1691.24 --> 1703.24
over there is like holy [ __ ] yeah that's

1695.14 --> 1705.0700000000002
very close in many ways even how he had

1703.24 --> 1707.049
videos about how the light would be

1705.07 --> 1708.6689999999999
projected potentially extra

1707.049 --> 1711.6
dimensionally it was pretty impressive

1708.669 --> 1711.6000000000001
so

1715.03 --> 1723.25
but yeah my model is rectangular looping

1719.36 --> 1728.1789999999999
with options as to how much potential

1723.25 --> 1734.059
space could be out there north and south

1728.179 --> 1740.27
of the non convinced of our realm beyond

1734.059 --> 1742.72
the north beyond the south and well the

1740.27 --> 1748.3
nature of the globe of the heavens is

1742.72 --> 1751.73
that it is free our win energy law

1748.3 --> 1753.23
thanks for that but it's holographic

1751.73 --> 1757.55
image as I was going to be at the edge

1753.23 --> 1762.89
of the of the vision of the observer in

1757.55 --> 1764.6
certain angular relations with the

1762.89 --> 1768.3400000000001
position of the earth and that are very

1764.6 --> 1771.4699999999998
persistent speculated how that could

1768.34 --> 1775.04
what that could result in once you move

1771.47 --> 1777.8
beyond the north and south that part of

1775.04 --> 1781.22
the yeah that half of the demogroup

1777.8 --> 1783.59
could change into another type of star

1781.22 --> 1787.42
system because it might be regional

1783.59 --> 1790.25
bound as I speculated that how the stars

1787.42 --> 1791.66
that concept the way the stars have

1790.25 --> 1795.16
appeared to us why they're always the

1791.66 --> 1798.5
same is because it is in some ways a

1795.16 --> 1800.3600000000001
reflection very complicated I don't know

1798.5 --> 1804.67
how that ties in with how the Earth's

1800.36 --> 1809.11
laid out so if there was another region

1804.67 --> 1811.8200000000002
then what the heavens would reflect upon

1809.11 --> 1815.57
in the face of that would also be

1811.82 --> 1818.51
different because I can't imagine that

1815.57 --> 1820.28
there would be a realm north or south of

1818.51 --> 1824.6299999999999
the are known realm that would literally

1820.28 --> 1828.23
be exactly the same but different that

1824.63 --> 1830.3300000000002
would be very freaky who knows maybe

1828.23 --> 1832.75
that is the case that would be totally

1830.33 --> 1832.75
freaky

1833.4 --> 1842.19
well good give a whole nother sense to

1836.16 --> 1844.19
that to the Mandela effect perhaps let's

1842.19 --> 1849.81
not go there just yet there's already

1844.19 --> 1853.6200000000001
ideas and reports and maps drawn of

1849.81 --> 1855.36
other types of regions being there so

1853.62 --> 1858.6299999999999
let's not assume it's going to be a

1855.36 --> 1866.37
mirror realm of our realm that would be

1858.63 --> 1869.5200000000002
weird but yeah how it works is there is

1866.37 --> 1872.2199999999998
especially looping confine there's a

1869.52 --> 1875.4
limited special realm and it loops in on

1872.22 --> 1882.21
itself and that loop would be orientated

1875.4 --> 1886.3100000000002
east to west would be tied in like the

1882.21 --> 1892.1100000000001
trainman station seen from the matrix to

1886.31 --> 1894.57
and however room north and south is I

1892.11 --> 1897.02
don't know and in the terrain man

1894.57 --> 1899.3999999999999
station scene you don't know either

1897.02 --> 1902.61
nobody actually goes all the way over

1899.4 --> 1904.26
there or the other way that well there's

1902.61 --> 1906.6899999999998
a kind of a wall over there maybe an

1904.26 --> 1912.09
exit door somewhere I don't know didn't

1906.69 --> 1914.28
really don't really remember but get the

1912.09 --> 1918.1499999999999
looping element is still there and it

1914.28 --> 1923.07
will be there wherever you go up until

1918.15 --> 1925.5
any end point where either it will

1923.07 --> 1927.21
appear to be like a center and no matter

1925.5 --> 1932.16
where you go you're always gonna go back

1927.21 --> 1937.08
or there may be a barrier of some kind I

1932.16 --> 1942.74
don't know I don't know but I do know

1937.08 --> 1947.72
that the orientation of it all is level

1942.74 --> 1947.72
there is no curve no concave no

1948.22 --> 1957.7
and how convex curvature not

1952.95 --> 1962.169
geometrically literally anyway so flat

1957.7 --> 1966.1290000000001
and with a limited confine a looping hum

1962.169 --> 1969.3400000000001
fine then they're do not need to be any

1966.129 --> 1974.74
barriers in order for the confine to

1969.34 --> 1977.11
have a a limited amount of space the

1974.74 --> 1979.47
limited amount of state space in at

1977.11 --> 1982.24
least the east-west dimension would be

1979.47 --> 1985.1490000000001
as good as a barrier because there

1982.24 --> 1990.659
simply cannot be any more gas it will

1985.149 --> 1993.37
push against it itself from those sides

1990.659 --> 1995.769
because of the limited space so that it

1993.37 --> 1997.4799999999998
relates to the gas pressure without a

1995.769 --> 1998.889
container well there is a container even

1997.48 --> 2001.919
though there may not be any physical

1998.889 --> 2003.809
barrier at some point because the space

2001.919 --> 2007.1390000000001
itself is limited and lubing in on

2003.809 --> 2011.19
itself and the looping factor would

2007.139 --> 2012.6
function as a barrier because it can't

2011.19 --> 2018.289
go anywhere it's just pushing pushing

2012.6 --> 2021.899
against itself so those are very

2018.289 --> 2028.549
critical concept conceptual parts of my

2021.899 --> 2031.11
rectangular looping model there you go

2028.549 --> 2035.1
now thank you for timing him out that

2031.11 --> 2037.9189999999999
was indeed what I would have done as

2035.1 --> 2040.4289999999999
well but I did actually answer his

2037.919 --> 2040.429
question

2043.71 --> 2051.06
okay you know what I'm actually just

2046.9 --> 2055.0
gonna ban him he's been such a whiner

2051.06 --> 2060.04
such a whining [ __ ] in other chats

2055.0 --> 2063.22
about me love ya love period so I I do

2060.04 --> 2066.7799999999997
it and now he acts like this it's just

2063.22 --> 2066.7799999999997
disgusting dude get life

2078.399 --> 2085.859
anyway Wow 60 watching cool

2093.77 --> 2102.64
yeah I think Regan Humphries tried to

2098.03 --> 2105.4100000000003
ask a genuine question about the stars

2102.64 --> 2113.27
it's a complicated issue when I say it

2105.41 --> 2115.94
is holographic in nature I mean this is

2113.27 --> 2119.9
a projection from the stars just like 2d

2115.94 --> 2121.64
that thinks in 3d no now that's not what

2119.9 --> 2123.11
I'm saying at all what I'm saying is

2121.64 --> 2128.0299999999997
actually the other way around these

2123.11 --> 2130.67
stars are light based phenomena that are

2128.03 --> 2134.21
only visually there and there is also

2130.67 --> 2136.61
light coming from them mostly from the

2134.21 --> 2138.7
Sun and that's the weird part about it

2136.61 --> 2141.59
there's all this energy just coming in

2138.7 --> 2144.83
being visible being absorbed by the

2141.59 --> 2148.88
earth is very confusing to realize that

2144.83 --> 2153.86
it's just light there is no physical

2148.88 --> 2155.69
source anywhere like not a lamp like

2153.86 --> 2158.619
source creating that but there is

2155.69 --> 2161.6
definitely energy manifesting and

2158.619 --> 2164.21
creating this light from a very

2161.6 --> 2166.3399999999997
directional orientation for some reason

2164.21 --> 2173.2400000000002
and it's amazing part of the design of

2166.34 --> 2175.82
the realm and I have a feeling that it

2173.24 --> 2182.359
has to do with the ether because of the

2175.82 --> 2186.75
ethers apparent rotational aspects it's

2182.359 --> 2189.71
just a just a feeling yet

2186.75 --> 2189.71
a clue

2197.1 --> 2201.95
well Ragnar Stefan he'll listen I could

2199.62 --> 2201.95
do that

2206.9 --> 2214.69
if he'd have me I guess I think it would

2211.58 --> 2214.69
be okay at this point

2222.78 --> 2228.42
and I I would certainly need a good list

2226.26 --> 2231.03
with all the bullet points together for

2228.42 --> 2234.83
that because there's a lot to the whole

2231.03 --> 2238.1400000000003
rectangular looping concept a lot and

2234.83 --> 2241.08
yeah if I'm gonna be in the spotlights

2238.14 --> 2244.02
about it then I might lose track of

2241.08 --> 2246.69
certain things forget about them so I

2244.02 --> 2249.2599999999998
would have to kind of make it a bullet

2246.69 --> 2249.26
point list

2257.71 --> 2263.92
or if rent he wants he could simply do

2261.28 --> 2266.8590000000004
it in interview style that is how I have

2263.92 --> 2269.4900000000002
done a lot so far every time I've been

2266.859 --> 2272.619
interviewed I could completely lay down

2269.49 --> 2274.93
answer the questions every time also

2272.619 --> 2282.3900000000003
when I definitely do not know with

2274.93 --> 2282.39
certainty so I don't know I'm up for it

2285.71 --> 2288.84
[Music]

2298.81 --> 2302.0789999999997
[Music]

2312.579 --> 2323.539
well Trish Blythe in general I would

2317.66 --> 2327.92
agree but yeah I've gone on josé's as

2323.539 --> 2331.009
well you know at this point a lot of it

2327.92 --> 2333.589
could also just be seen as okay whenever

2331.009 --> 2336.709
I joined then at least you got something

2333.589 --> 2341.929
real I doubt I don't mean that to sound

2336.709 --> 2345.529
arrogant but I kind of try to see it

2341.929 --> 2349.329
like that and when things get just too

2345.529 --> 2349.329
messy I just leave

2363.81 --> 2366.909
[Music]

2375.52 --> 2378.18
all right

2386.84 --> 2392.33
yeah except for well see there you go

2389.87 --> 2395.23
except for this except well not just

2392.33 --> 2399.77
except for George okay

2395.23 --> 2410.0
rumpus was also complete ass and many

2399.77 --> 2413.36
others were also being asses you know

2410.0 --> 2415.97
you could say okay Ron T is conducting

2413.36 --> 2419.6
himself relatively professionally and I

2415.97 --> 2426.23
would have to say yes sure but as for

2419.6 --> 2430.19
the complete show well it does become

2426.23 --> 2434.83
quite messy as for the behavior of the

2430.19 --> 2434.83
guests very much so

2435.48 --> 2438.55
[Music]

2443.48 --> 2450.7
hey mojo Friday

2447.07 --> 2450.7000000000003
long time no see

2456.579 --> 2463.3390000000004
yeah well exactly mark coloured look see

2459.89 --> 2466.509
see Trish Blythe it's just you could

2463.339 --> 2466.509
call it professional but

2479.13 --> 2485.569
what do I think of gleam I think gleam

2481.979 --> 2485.569
is an interesting person

2490.46 --> 2497.869
I don't really know him too well though

2493.94 --> 2501.26
yet but I've already I don't know did I

2497.869 --> 2503.2400000000002
get him on my channel some time ago I'm

2501.26 --> 2507.17
not sure but I've already pretty much

2503.24 --> 2509.0589999999997
said that he would be welcome on on the

2507.17 --> 2512.9
early bird show if he could make it he

2509.059 --> 2515.65
said he could because he he is English

2512.9 --> 2518.9500000000003
so that wouldn't be too inconvenient

2515.65 --> 2518.9500000000003
time wise

2531.39 --> 2536.85
right well pump Salette asks if the

2535.41 --> 2541.29
earth was flat with the Sun and Moon

2536.85 --> 2544.11
being some sort of spotlights if you

2541.29 --> 2550.38
were in high enough spot wouldn't you be

2544.11 --> 2555.9900000000002
able to see the Sun 24/7 no no you

2550.38 --> 2559.59
wouldn't and besides these some sort of

2555.99 --> 2561.45
spotlights are not that's the confusing

2559.59 --> 2564.48
part about it they are part of the

2561.45 --> 2567.7799999999997
holographic nature of the heavens so

2564.48 --> 2573.89
there is not literally a location where

2567.78 --> 2577.38
there is a spotlight it all relates to

2573.89 --> 2579.6
the observer on the earth as to where it

2577.38 --> 2581.3900000000003
apparently comes from that's the weird

2579.6 --> 2585.42
part about it

2581.39 --> 2588.0299999999997
so there's not going to be a spot for

2585.42 --> 2589.9500000000003
high enough if if it would even be

2588.03 --> 2592.0800000000004
technically possible to get there

2589.95 --> 2596.0099999999998
without bumping into a barrier or just

2592.08 --> 2600.66
being unable to go higher whatever to

2596.01 --> 2602.76
see where the light is apparently

2600.66 --> 2605.1
manifesting in relation to the position

2602.76 --> 2611.61
of the earth because you wouldn't see

2605.1 --> 2613.65
that you just wouldn't see it that's how

2611.61 --> 2616.08
I presume it will be that if you go up

2613.65 --> 2619.07
high enough you simply will not be able

2616.08 --> 2624.54
to see any of the lights of the heavens

2619.07 --> 2626.78
they want to manifest maybe I'm wrong

2624.54 --> 2626.7799999999997
though

2629.43 --> 2634.71
no there was this one balloon video

2632.1 --> 2636.75
where they went up at night specifically

2634.71 --> 2640.59
and then still very high up were able to

2636.75 --> 2647.36
see stars that was very interesting but

2640.59 --> 2651.54
yeah I'd still have to see any kind of

2647.36 --> 2656.7000000000003
well a better way to approach the

2651.54 --> 2658.44
question would be not to ask what

2656.7 --> 2661.2799999999997
happens if you go up really high would

2658.44 --> 2664.92
you see the spotlight no it would be

2661.28 --> 2667.6800000000003
okay can you first confirm that there is

2664.92 --> 2669.38
a literal location in some way about the

2667.68 --> 2672.6
Sun where the light is coming from

2669.38 --> 2676.35
approach it see if you can approach it

2672.6 --> 2679.77
see if the parents Sun disk size will

2676.35 --> 2684.24
grow bigger all that see if you can get

2679.77 --> 2691.95
there or if it will simply Bend away as

2684.24 --> 2699.93
you approach it that would be a good

2691.95 --> 2704.33
start and yeah to to say it short prove

2699.93 --> 2704.33
a proximity to the Sun

2725.68 --> 2729.5099999999998
so I hope that answers your question

2761.32 --> 2766.38
all right okay hey

2789.58 --> 2792.2999999999997
hmm

2797.9 --> 2808.69
spero music let me check mm don't think

2803.84 --> 2808.69
so I will see

2809.69 --> 2812.76
[Music]

2814.56 --> 2817.19
nope

2819.07 --> 2824.01
oh wait maybe

2828.1 --> 2836.17
somebody called Brenda my ally donated

2832.24 --> 2840.75
$10 I think I may have forgot to shout

2836.17 --> 2840.75
that one out it was 25 days ago

2847.63 --> 2854.7290000000003
but yeah it's still standing at a 135 so

2851.38 --> 2860.92
it's yet not going anywhere for a while

2854.729 --> 2864.459
but to get there somehow who knows

2860.92 --> 2869.92
what's gonna be happening in the next

2864.459 --> 2872.109
few months may just end up just freakin

2869.92 --> 2874.829
buying the thing myself if I had the

2872.109 --> 2874.8289999999997
opportunity

2880.29 --> 2885.9
oh yeah now what I thought that was you

2883.05 --> 2887.73
Brendan thank you for that sorry for

2885.9 --> 2895.1
forgetting to shout you out if I did I

2887.73 --> 2895.1
don't remember if I did okay yeah

2927.92 --> 2939.41
right that's interesting Reagan

2931.24 --> 2944.4799999999996
Humphries well the way I see it is that

2939.41 --> 2947.21
somehow light just manifests the

2944.48 --> 2949.97
daylight from that specific direction

2947.21 --> 2952.369
and with the Sun disc when you try to

2949.97 --> 2954.22
look at it whatever with filters or with

2952.369 --> 2957.589
the camera or with your naked eye that

2954.22 --> 2960.6189999999997
Sun disc seems to be just an apparent

2957.589 --> 2966.349
phenomenon I don't know I consider it

2960.619 --> 2971.3900000000003
like that is what happens when you just

2966.349 --> 2973.279
look perfectly parallel to to the exact

2971.39 --> 2976.73
direction the daylight is coming from

2973.279 --> 2980.029
and then you see that so more like an

2976.73 --> 2982.94
optical side effect almost like a lens

2980.029 --> 2985.849
flare but not exactly as a lens flares

2982.94 --> 2990.9500000000003
that is a secondary tertiary effect

2985.849 --> 2995.3900000000003
whatever from the lens itself but more a

2990.95 --> 2998.5389999999998
primary type lens flare effect that is

2995.39 --> 3001.0589999999997
just what the Sun discs looked like and

2998.539 --> 3004.6600000000003
maybe even the moonlight

3001.059 --> 3008.71
maybe the that apparent moon disc thing

3004.66 --> 3011.2889999999998
that we see is also a holographic

3008.71 --> 3015.369
pattern that just happens when you look

3011.289 --> 3018.039
or directly parallel to the moon light

3015.369 --> 3020.23
direction may simply be a holographic

3018.039 --> 3026.259
side effect of when you look perfectly

3020.23 --> 3029.92
parallel that is I don't know how else

3026.259 --> 3032.5
at this moment to approach it that is

3029.92 --> 3036.15
kind of how I am trying to conceptualize

3032.5 --> 3036.15
the holographic nature of it

3046.91 --> 3055.089
no that's not true benevolent I would

3051.529 --> 3059.71
not have been able to absolutely not

3055.089 --> 3059.71
because I'd have to pay that all back

3066.93 --> 3073.14
now the only way I could afford a p900

3069.779 --> 3076.5
from two weeks work is if I had a

3073.14 --> 3080.1299999999997
full-time job was doing really well and

3076.5 --> 3086.13
growing in it and had just good

3080.13 --> 3088.289
entanglement and then eventually I would

3086.13 --> 3091.65
start to like really make surplus and

3088.289 --> 3093.42
then with that surplus get that yeah

3091.65 --> 3102.089
that's what happens when you have just

3093.42 --> 3105.539
fully invested in a career well I did

3102.089 --> 3109.349
four weeks work and that was three years

3105.539 --> 3113.8190000000004
ago now I think okay I did that I was

3109.349 --> 3119.059
full-time okay I made little surplus you

3113.819 --> 3122.279
know how much it was roughly 200 euros

3119.059 --> 3123.48
that I actually got improv or it didn't

3122.279 --> 3127.589
have to give that back

3123.48 --> 3130.89
Wow well that's not enough for p900

3127.589 --> 3133.609
so it would have to technically be two

3130.89 --> 3133.609
months

3138.84 --> 3141.53
now

3143.17 --> 3148.28
now it's not that it doesn't it just

3146.0 --> 3154.01
doesn't work like that in my situation

3148.28 --> 3159.0800000000004
unfortunately if only but yeah I am

3154.01 --> 3162.17
working on plans we'll see if it is if

3159.08 --> 3170.36
those plans can be ironed out to be

3162.17 --> 3173.1800000000003
viable in some way alright what Trish

3170.36 --> 3176.57
Blythe there is all kinds of look we

3173.18 --> 3178.85
have practically socialism over here so

3176.57 --> 3180.67
if you get money it's not really your

3178.85 --> 3183.74
money

3180.67 --> 3189.41
there's all these things you're forced

3183.74 --> 3192.4399999999996
to pay every step TEKsystems oh yeah if

3189.41 --> 3195.8599999999997
you're really if you're crushing it then

3192.44 --> 3199.73
you can make a profit sure but if you're

3195.86 --> 3201.7400000000002
not crushing it then it's very easy to

3199.73 --> 3203.75
get stuck in all the tack stations

3201.74 --> 3210.47
everywhere because taxes are high on

3203.75 --> 3214.28
everything so even though I get Social

3210.47 --> 3218.87
Welfare as it were it's really very

3214.28 --> 3222.2000000000003
little it is because of just how much

3218.87 --> 3223.94
everything costs and because of the way

3222.2 --> 3225.6499999999996
everything works that if I actually do

3223.94 --> 3228.92
make money I just have to pretty much

3225.65 --> 3231.92
straight out give it back all of it

3228.92 --> 3235.94
until the monthly total income becomes

3231.92 --> 3241.31
more and then softly oh then taxes start

3235.94 --> 3245.4700000000003
to apply it's right so yeah as I said

3241.31 --> 3250.5499999999997
the only way that works is to just get a

3245.47 --> 3251.93
viable career going full time job and if

3250.55 --> 3253.94
that happened I can pretty much

3251.93 --> 3258.02
guarantee that's gonna be the end of the

3253.94 --> 3260.48
early bird show because this hour is

3258.02 --> 3265.25
pretty much always gonna be a working

3260.48 --> 3269.9
hour so yeah and I'm actually

3265.25 --> 3272.9
considering it so yeah good for you

3269.9 --> 3275.15
trolls it's just you know you kept on

3272.9 --> 3279.08
whining about are we and getting a job

3275.15 --> 3283.28
might just do that now and yeah you're

3279.08 --> 3286.1
gonna have to do without me after that

3283.28 --> 3288.4700000000003
point and I don't know when and if I'm

3286.1 --> 3291.0499999999997
gonna come back if I do but I don't know

3288.47 --> 3293.81
if that's gonna happen just yet because

3291.05 --> 3298.25
I still have to figure out if what I had

3293.81 --> 3300.2599999999998
in mind is a viable plan because I'm not

3298.25 --> 3302.36
just going to do a job because of some

3300.26 --> 3304.5200000000004
freaking peer pressure and get stuck in

3302.36 --> 3308.48
a job not actually getting anywhere I've

3304.52 --> 3313.0099999999998
refused to go I don't go I'm not gonna

3308.48 --> 3316.34
do that [ __ ] so and hey if I get that

3313.01 --> 3321.73
done then maybe at some point I could

3316.34 --> 3321.73
perhaps do a a weekly thing or whatever

3321.94 --> 3333.82
if I still feel like it if people still

3326.24 --> 3336.9199999999996
really care about it and I know that

3333.82 --> 3340.75
yeah people like Brent em and many

3336.92 --> 3344.89
others have been very loyal listeners

3340.75 --> 3349.66
and I do appreciate that a lot

3344.89 --> 3349.66
but yeah

3351.18 --> 3356.64
yeah as other people that also point out

3353.88 --> 3358.92
there's not a lot of growth and whether

3356.64 --> 3361.68
that is algorithm induced like I'm not

3358.92 --> 3365.25
supposed to be making it in the opinion

3361.68 --> 3367.3199999999997
of Google algorithm or whether that is

3365.25 --> 3370.05
because people think yeah it's all my

3367.32 --> 3372.0
son funny are we oh yeah oh he has very

3370.05 --> 3374.9700000000003
good moments but he's not very

3372.0 --> 3378.21
persistent and doesn't seem very

3374.97 --> 3380.31
professional yeah so then I don't get

3378.21 --> 3380.88
money I don't get giant super chats all

3380.31 --> 3385.65
the time

3380.88 --> 3388.02
I don't grow up to 5000 subscribers in

3385.65 --> 3390.78
the course of a few months yeah

3388.02 --> 3394.11
well that also means that I am

3390.78 --> 3397.4700000000003
practically only getting anywhere on an

3394.11 --> 3400.5
intellectual basis and maybe in learning

3397.47 --> 3402.18
how to deal with social matters that's

3400.5 --> 3404.61
where I'm making progress as for

3402.18 --> 3406.95
financially well I'm pretty much exactly

3404.61 --> 3412.1
where I was at the beginning of this

3406.95 --> 3412.1
year right now just so you know

3422.76 --> 3432.2400000000002
now benevolent very funny I'm just

3426.84 --> 3435.9300000000003
telling you that I already talked about

3432.24 --> 3438.4799999999996
this and I do my show and in certain

3435.93 --> 3441.8399999999997
hour that is always going to be part of

3438.48 --> 3444.869
full-time jobs so I won't be able to do

3441.84 --> 3453.42
that show anymore and there's kind of my

3444.869 --> 3454.46
slot of the day so yeah that's how it's

3453.42 --> 3457.32
gonna work

3454.46 --> 3459.54
that's what happens if you keep on

3457.32 --> 3462.69
complaining it that my show is not good

3459.54 --> 3463.68
enough and I do I know most of you in my

3462.69 --> 3465.6
chat don't do that

3463.68 --> 3469.109
or there are some people that do and

3465.6 --> 3474.5099999999998
that are really trolling me constantly

3469.109 --> 3476.88
with that [ __ ] while I'm not financially

3474.51 --> 3478.98
getting anywhere so every time they do

3476.88 --> 3484.26
that [ __ ] they actually have a point and

3478.98 --> 3486.869
it's nagging because yeah you're all

3484.26 --> 3490.98
being most of you that I know are being

3486.869 --> 3493.619
really nice to me and I really

3490.98 --> 3496.44
appreciate that I'm not gonna try to

3493.619 --> 3498.119
squeeze money out of you because I know

3496.44 --> 3501.57
that most of you that have been very

3498.119 --> 3504.08
loyal listeners and supporters moral

3501.57 --> 3510.119
support and just social support have

3504.08 --> 3512.67
don't aren't exactly rich yourselves but

3510.119 --> 3513.9300000000003
yeah at the same time yeah I am not

3512.67 --> 3517.35
getting anywhere and I'm getting

3513.93 --> 3520.7999999999997
seriously trolled with this [ __ ] so you

3517.35 --> 3527.3399999999997
can imagine that it's gonna end at some

3520.8 --> 3532.59
point because of this right now more

3527.34 --> 3534.57
colored you affect the trolls not if

3532.59 --> 3539.359
it's actually if they actually have a

3534.57 --> 3539.3590000000004
point you know that's the point

3555.37 --> 3563.23
an evening show sure well I'm not gonna

3560.8 --> 3565.15
be able to maintain that if I also do

3563.23 --> 3569.89
the early bird show it's just not viable

3565.15 --> 3572.08
at this point also that's not again that

3569.89 --> 3573.94
it's not a guarantee that I'm gonna

3572.08 --> 3576.72
actually improve my situation

3573.94 --> 3576.7200000000003
financially

3598.95 --> 3605.2799999999997
yeah well mark colors they are trolls

3601.98 --> 3607.7400000000002
because they are using something to nag

3605.28 --> 3609.9900000000002
me with that's what trolls do and when

3607.74 --> 3612.72
trolls got a point that is actually

3609.99 --> 3615.839
valid there are no longer trolls well

3612.72 --> 3618.18
those people that do that are still the

3615.839 --> 3621.54
same people that troll others with

3618.18 --> 3625.859
nonsense so they're still trolls and

3621.54 --> 3627.599
then one I know who they are weirdly

3625.859 --> 3631.02
enough one of them is actually Julie

3627.599 --> 3638.849
Bennett who if I remember correctly was

3631.02 --> 3640.53
on this show this and she's now trolling

3638.849 --> 3644.52
me and telling me to get a job and all

3640.53 --> 3649.5890000000004
that [ __ ] it's it's not doesn't make me

3644.52 --> 3656.66
happy really thank you by the way Ellie

3649.589 --> 3660.859
be for the Denmark crooner 20 of them

3656.66 --> 3660.859
get on with what stuff

3664.91 --> 3672.7999999999997
Oh after work really well I think that

3670.25 --> 3674.72
after work at least for the first few

3672.8 --> 3677.9300000000003
months I'm just going to be freaking

3674.72 --> 3680.0899999999997
tired also as soon as I stop being

3677.93 --> 3683.66
freaking tired after work I'm gonna be

3680.09 --> 3686.4500000000003
doing studying because I will of course

3683.66 --> 3689.27
want to rank up because I don't want to

3686.45 --> 3693.0499999999997
be stuck at the dead-end job of the

3689.27 --> 3696.59
spectrum of the field that I'm gonna

3693.05 --> 3705.11
approach I want a career I don't want a

3696.59 --> 3706.4900000000002
shitty job yeah so after work sure but

3705.11 --> 3711.08
that's probably gonna take at least

3706.49 --> 3713.62
three years before I get to the point

3711.08 --> 3717.17
where I actually have time to waste on

3713.62 --> 3719.63
participating in this again and my god

3717.17 --> 3723.8
I'll be half I'll be forced to do a lot

3719.63 --> 3726.1400000000003
of updating because my mind's not gonna

3723.8 --> 3729.86
be set to all this when I do that my

3726.14 --> 3731.7799999999997
mind's going to be set to to figuring

3729.86 --> 3734.1200000000003
out my career and what I can do and what

3731.78 --> 3736.19
I should do what I'm good at how do I

3734.12 --> 3739.31
promote my I'm gonna be totally absorbed

3736.19 --> 3740.51
by that I'm not gonna have any attention

3739.31 --> 3747.89
