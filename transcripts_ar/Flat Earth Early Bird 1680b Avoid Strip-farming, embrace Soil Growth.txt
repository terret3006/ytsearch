you're using how great is that it's

107.04 --> 110.18

110.7 --> 114.259
hello Richard G good to see you

131.34 --> 137.54
all right so yeah I completely I don't

133.98 --> 137.54
know what I was talking about

138.72 --> 146.9
we were talking about

142.14 --> 146.89999999999998
I mentioned some television stuff

147.3 --> 152.59900000000002
that's it

149.94 --> 152.599
all right

161.7 --> 167.11999999999998
hey we guys can we can talk about

164.34 --> 167.12
whatever you like

169.08 --> 173.04000000000002
you said your rewrite you thought it was

170.879 --> 175.319
probably you're in okay

173.04 --> 178.22
well I don't know why that even happens

175.319 --> 178.22
at all

185.7 --> 192.06
and it it thankfully it does very rarely

188.819 --> 194.78
happen it doesn't happen a lot I'm very

192.06 --> 194.78
glad it doesn't

198.98 --> 202.04
all right

221.34 --> 229.159
Sanford

224.159 --> 229.159
mountains and routers you said on their

229.68 --> 232.28
Maybe

233.459 --> 238.879
but it's in in this case it isn't the

235.98 --> 243.599
router that was getting blocked it was

238.879 --> 246.62
the Intel link so it was the connector

243.599 --> 246.61999999999998
through the socket

248.4 --> 253.98000000000002
when I if I can't get in the room where

251.04 --> 256.859
the other one is plugged in then I can't

253.98 --> 259.26
do anything to reset them I the only way

256.859 --> 262.74
to do that for me then would be to reset

259.26 --> 265.259
the the power in the house

262.74 --> 269.54
but yeah that you can't keep your

265.259 --> 269.54
computer running while you do that so

280.8 --> 284.90000000000003
okay George Sanford good for you

304.08 --> 307.03999999999996
foreign

321.259 --> 328.139
so yeah I'm completely open to talk

325.919 --> 330.12
about whatever as long as it's not

328.139 --> 331.44
unbelievably boring

330.12 --> 336.32
so

331.44 --> 336.32
because yeah whatever man I'm open

366.5 --> 369.779
[Music]

371.94 --> 377.3
anything happening out there that I'm

374.16 --> 377.3
not aware of perhaps

408.96 --> 411.13899999999995
oh

414.0 --> 418.039
this is nice I think

418.08 --> 422.539
just reading this article that

419.58 --> 422.539
apparently today

422.699 --> 428.34000000000003
letters got

424.919 --> 431.35999999999996
on the mail out there like they started

428.34 --> 431.35999999999996
the uh

432.72 --> 436.759
call that

434.34 --> 439.979
the procedure to actually

436.759 --> 442.02000000000004
eventually lead to convictions of the

439.979 --> 446.0
whole medical experimentation that's

442.02 --> 446.0
happened here in the Netherlands

447.36 --> 452.699
and it's like a lot of people are

450.0 --> 454.74
involved I mean they're all getting it

452.699 --> 457.259
like

454.74 --> 460.259
it's it's like a lot of people are part

457.259 --> 463.139
of this and it is like a

460.259 --> 465.96000000000004
a criminal procedure like

463.139 --> 468.539
to persecute crime and it's happening

465.96 --> 470.84
it just started happening so that that's

468.539 --> 470.84
something

474.66 --> 479.59900000000005
okay I just had eight kittens wow Jesus

481.68 --> 485.06
that's a lot of cats

494.099 --> 498.199
that's a big yeah 80 is big

498.66 --> 501.44
it is

506.34 --> 511.67999999999995
I think like a normal batch unless it's

509.22 --> 514.62
like a really big type cat or something

511.68 --> 517.76
I don't know but a normal batch would be

514.62 --> 517.76
like three or four

521.219 --> 526.62
so I don't know what that cat's been

523.44 --> 529.32
eating but they get like eight that is

526.62 --> 532.2
pretty unusual I've never heard of any

529.32 --> 535.2
cat having eight kittens that is

532.2 --> 535.2
astounding

537.12 --> 544.22
she's maxed out right I guess yeah you

540.839 --> 544.22
could definitely say that

545.82 --> 550.2
there's probably gonna be a lot of

547.62 --> 552.6
competing over those nipples

550.2 --> 555.12
with those little kittens

552.6 --> 556.14
because they're not all gonna be as

555.12 --> 559.14
great

556.14 --> 561.24
so you're gonna get like the strongest

559.14 --> 561.959
kid in going for the best nipple and all

561.24 --> 564.48
that

561.959 --> 566.399
you're that's going to happen

564.48 --> 568.32
when you have that many hidden I hope

566.399 --> 570.24
they all make it through usually when

568.32 --> 571.86
there's a really big litter there's

570.24 --> 576.0600000000001
chances that

571.86 --> 578.779
one of them or more is just gonna like

576.06 --> 578.779
die

579.36 --> 582.92
or become really little

586.56 --> 591.5999999999999
just morning yeah but I mean it's still

589.38 --> 592.92
amazing

591.6 --> 596.0
um

592.92 --> 596.0
so many of them

599.15 --> 602.8199999999999

646.2 --> 649.0400000000001
about your dad

649.68 --> 653.399

651.6 --> 656.36
literally

653.399 --> 656.36
it's uh yeah

659.88 --> 663.2
it's kind of unexpected

666.0 --> 669.5
oh wow I got a photo

670.74 --> 675.12
completely buried

672.899 --> 678.12
under kittens

675.12 --> 681.2
that's amazing

678.12 --> 681.2
I'm gonna show that

686.1 --> 688.16
um

700.5 --> 707.18
this is Elise picture he just

704.22 --> 707.1800000000001
shared with me

715.14 --> 718.459
yeah that's super cute

718.68 --> 723.8389999999999
but it is like

720.24 --> 725.64
getting buried under a ball of kittens

723.839 --> 729.1400000000001
for mommy there

725.64 --> 729.14
it really looks like that

738.48 --> 741.9200000000001
yeah thanks for sharing that

749.06 --> 752.06
thank you

752.16 --> 756.9599999999999
foreign

753.86 --> 756.96
[Music]

766.44 --> 771.1800000000001
love having cats around yeah

769.38 --> 773.3389999999999
me too

771.18 --> 775.56
I mean I always have like those neighbor

773.339 --> 778.5790000000001
cat the neighbor cats

775.56 --> 778.579
around here

781.32 --> 787.8000000000001
although that one cat is getting on my

784.74 --> 789.899
nerves a bit sometimes because he's such

787.8 --> 792.7199999999999
a freaking food junkie it's not even

789.899 --> 795.899
funny anymore like he he literally

792.72 --> 798.0790000000001
becomes like neurotically obsessed with

795.899 --> 798.079
it

798.779 --> 804.0
we're just the only thing he can think

801.3 --> 807.3
about is like

804.0 --> 809.76
it's not even like oh where can I get

807.3 --> 812.76
some food now he's like just continually

809.76 --> 816.12
assuming that everything I do

812.76 --> 818.279
is gonna lead to him get to giving him

816.12 --> 820.44
food like he's so freaking obsessed with

818.279 --> 821.7
it it gets on my freaking nerves

820.44 --> 824.4590000000001
sometimes

821.7 --> 828.1800000000001
just like get out of here I'm not giving

824.459 --> 828.18
you food anymore

833.339 --> 836.519
I mean it's still great to have around

834.839 --> 840.6800000000001
but once you start feeding and me

836.519 --> 840.68
becomes like this obsessed monster

853.86 --> 856.88
but uh

862.92 --> 867.18
yeah you're still hanging around your

864.839 --> 869.22
dad regularly

867.18 --> 872.3599999999999
like

869.22 --> 872.36
do you live near him

875.04 --> 878.3
I thought you didn't right

893.399 --> 898.339
yeah if you don't want to talk about it

895.56 --> 898.3389999999999
that's fine too

900.839 --> 905.339
five minutes away all right all right

903.54 --> 907.639
all right so you are really close to him

905.339 --> 907.639
okay

910.94 --> 915.5600000000001
[Music]

912.24 --> 915.5600000000001
I see him every day all right

916.16 --> 919.519
lucky you

926.639 --> 932.12
I don't really seem to have that much

929.04 --> 932.12
contact with my dad

932.94 --> 937.6800000000001
I mean like

935.339 --> 939.7790000000001
in the last half year I really tried to

937.68 --> 942.019
call him a lot and he just wouldn't pick

939.779 --> 942.019
up

942.6 --> 946.9200000000001
and then sometimes randomly he wouldn't

944.82 --> 949.82
and it's basically like he's just

946.92 --> 949.8199999999999
leaving his phone

949.98 --> 954.5
home or whatever and he's all over the

952.32 --> 954.5
place

954.959 --> 959.5999999999999
but I guess

956.94 --> 959.6
I don't know

982.5 --> 987.899
right but is there like

985.139 --> 990.0600000000001
things you can do or that you do do

987.899 --> 992.22
together to for like recovery and all

990.06 --> 996.3599999999999
that

992.22 --> 998.5790000000001
to stimulate recovery I don't know I'm

996.36 --> 1001.22
I feel like I'm like digging into your

998.579 --> 1003.199
personal life you basically have to

1001.22 --> 1005.779
describe it

1003.199 --> 1008.3199999999999
or I could stop asking

1005.779 --> 1008.32
and just

1032.6 --> 1036.9189999999999
hmm

1034.28 --> 1039.319
play a lot of Chess oh cool

1036.919 --> 1041.24
all right well that's cool that we can

1039.319 --> 1043.48
still actually play chess that is

1041.24 --> 1043.48
awesome

1052.46 --> 1055.059
foreign

1062.9 --> 1065.9
oh

1073.64 --> 1077.44
but he still likes to play it

1103.58 --> 1109.1599999999999
I'll get you next time

1106.34 --> 1111.76
right as long as he still has fun doing

1109.16 --> 1111.76
it you know

1111.799 --> 1116.179
that's the most important part as long

1114.5 --> 1117.62
as he doesn't feel like he can't win

1116.179 --> 1119.7800000000002
because of

1117.62 --> 1121.6399999999999
his condition or something

1119.78 --> 1123.5
then everything should be fine as long

1121.64 --> 1124.8200000000002
as it Still Remains stimulating it's

1123.5 --> 1127.66
just great

1124.82 --> 1127.6599999999999
foreign

1133.34 --> 1138.6999999999998
oh

1135.2 --> 1138.7
okay that's not great

1163.94 --> 1166.8400000000001
hmm

1197.6 --> 1205.0
like do you think it is that like he's

1200.72 --> 1208.94
is he going downhill further is it like

1205.0 --> 1210.679
slowly or is he like really crumbling I

1208.94 --> 1213.44
I yeah sorry that might be a very

1210.679 --> 1214.5800000000002
painful question but I do Wonder like is

1213.44 --> 1217.52
it

1214.58 --> 1220.039
like palpably getting worse or is it

1217.52 --> 1223.4189999999999
just like he just got knocked down

1220.039 --> 1223.419
and he's like at that level

1223.58 --> 1228.1599999999999
or is it like continually growing worse

1239.539 --> 1243.22
yeah oh yeah that's

1243.32 --> 1247.8999999999999
sounds like he had concentration issues

1245.66 --> 1247.9
then

1267.14 --> 1272.24
right

1269.0 --> 1274.52
okay yeah what was that's better than

1272.24 --> 1277.58
English I mean it's much better that you

1274.52 --> 1280.28
just get knocked down suddenly

1277.58 --> 1283.28
and that you can stay at that level at

1280.28 --> 1286.7
least right because the worst thing ever

1283.28 --> 1288.9189999999999
is when you get like a aneurysm or

1286.7 --> 1290.24
something like that

1288.919 --> 1292.7
and that

1290.24 --> 1295.039
it just keeps getting worse and worse

1292.7 --> 1296.539
like the degenerate that's the worst

1295.039 --> 1299.0
thing you could have and that's like

1296.539 --> 1302.44
that leads to death but if he just got

1299.0 --> 1306.08
knocked down and yeah it sucks but

1302.44 --> 1308.6000000000001
technically you can somewhat recover

1306.08 --> 1310.82
from that and at least it's gonna stay

1308.6 --> 1312.5
there then and can stay there for a very

1310.82 --> 1314.78
long time

1312.5 --> 1316.76
that's a much better situation to find

1314.78 --> 1319.34
yourself at

1316.76 --> 1323.86
then if it's like continually crumbling

1319.34 --> 1323.86
which is basically like dementia then

1327.5 --> 1331.539
hmm

1328.94 --> 1331.539
right

1332.9 --> 1338.419
but if it's like stable enough and not

1335.48 --> 1340.88
continually degenerating then also there

1338.419 --> 1344.0
is like a chance it always is

1340.88 --> 1347.24
to get some of it back to basically

1344.0 --> 1349.64
recover some of it

1347.24 --> 1351.559
and then it's gonna be like oh you're

1349.64 --> 1353.48
gonna have this low staircase

1351.559 --> 1356.4189999999999
functioning and moments of high

1353.48 --> 1358.34
staircase functioning and so

1356.419 --> 1360.6200000000001
how are you going to use those

1358.34 --> 1363.5
situations can can you see them coming

1360.62 --> 1366.82
can you aim it can you utilize them the

1363.5 --> 1366.82
right moment right

1367.64 --> 1373.5200000000002
so you can still have great function

1369.86 --> 1375.02
then if you're sharp enough to manage it

1373.52 --> 1378.98
properly

1375.02 --> 1381.08
if you don't just like oh I am Dumber

1378.98 --> 1382.94
sometimes so that means now that I am

1381.08 --> 1384.799
dumb because if you if that's your

1382.94 --> 1386.659
conclusion then you're not gonna reach

1384.799 --> 1390.28
out to recover

1386.659 --> 1390.2800000000002
to the higher faculties again

1393.86 --> 1398.12
right

1395.84 --> 1400.8799999999999
well that's a relief then I was looking

1398.12 --> 1403.9399999999998
for some kind of relief point there at

1400.88 --> 1405.7990000000002
least it's not continually getting worse

1403.94 --> 1407.059
that was a bit of that was the

1405.799 --> 1408.86
impression that I did get a bit

1407.059 --> 1410.6589999999999
yesterday when you were when you

1408.86 --> 1412.6399999999999
mentioned that

1410.659 --> 1414.2600000000002
didn't really have time to hear you out

1412.64 --> 1415.88
back then because I was in the middle of

1414.26 --> 1417.74
rounding out the show

1415.88 --> 1422.8600000000001
but

1417.74 --> 1422.86
yeah good to know at least it's stable

1442.52 --> 1448.22
laughs

1445.22 --> 1448.22
foreign

1455.62 --> 1459.01
[Music]

1503.179 --> 1509.2
rag

1504.62 --> 1509.1999999999998
yeah at least right yeah yeah I remember

1522.32 --> 1529.34
right well in this like with the driving

1525.679 --> 1532.76
thing is it so bad that he's like

1529.34 --> 1535.039
it's complete hazard or could you still

1532.76 --> 1538.76
like take him out

1535.039 --> 1541.64
in the I don't know like in nature

1538.76 --> 1544.1
somewhere without trees like to just

1541.64 --> 1548.0800000000002
have him have a drive without any other

1544.1 --> 1548.08
cars around is can he still do that

1548.779 --> 1554.179
or is it is it just like so unfocused

1551.36 --> 1557.799
that he just can't get the mechanism of

1554.179 --> 1557.799
the car correctly anymore

1589.0 --> 1593.72
right so it looks like Nathan is not

1591.86 --> 1598.1789999999999
done yet

1593.72 --> 1598.179
with getting his computer back in order

1610.58 --> 1615.26
it's weird I want to rant about

1612.919 --> 1618.94
something I want to get ranty and angry

1615.26 --> 1618.94
about something because nobody's home

1622.039 --> 1625.96
I want to go get loud

1626.6 --> 1633.559
yeah because at least I mean it's good

1630.38 --> 1636.74
to have this conversation but I mean

1633.559 --> 1639.2
it is kind of like

1636.74 --> 1641.539
a bit depressing

1639.2 --> 1644.26
it's left arm is super lame

1641.539 --> 1644.26
hmm

1647.299 --> 1650.2
oh

1650.9 --> 1653.6200000000001
okay

1653.9 --> 1658.3400000000001
that's weird

1655.82 --> 1660.6789999999999
so it is like mechanical functioning

1658.34 --> 1662.36
issues he does have that

1660.679 --> 1665.419
so you have some mechanical function

1662.36 --> 1668.0
issues because of the aneurysm

1665.419 --> 1670.6000000000001
that is tough is there no way for that

1668.0 --> 1670.6
to recover

1671.12 --> 1679.2199999999998
like Canty just like muscle train it

1675.559 --> 1682.3999999999999
like just like squeeze this thing just

1679.22 --> 1684.94
and that way just get more grip on it

1682.4 --> 1684.94
literally

1698.08 --> 1704.3799999999999
yeah I know at least I'm not I get that

1706.1 --> 1710.84
what I'm I'm not saying like that he

1708.74 --> 1714.679
should be like allowed back in public

1710.84 --> 1717.5
traffic situations right logically yeah

1714.679 --> 1720.6200000000001
that would be too dangerous but I mean

1717.5 --> 1723.38
couldn't he still just drive like for

1720.62 --> 1725.779
the fun of it away from other cars with

1723.38 --> 1728.72
somebody next to him like you who could

1725.779 --> 1731.0
basically like oh [ __ ] if it goes wrong

1728.72 --> 1733.58
like

1731.0 --> 1736.82
get the car under control

1733.58 --> 1739.539
get it to stop and then yeah no accident

1736.82 --> 1743.559
basically that he could still do it

1739.539 --> 1743.559
because he likes to do it

1746.059 --> 1751.6399999999999
no immediate Elders left

1749.419 --> 1754.1000000000001
to enjoy the time with them now yeah I

1751.64 --> 1756.44
know blue pill Devolution I mean that's

1754.1 --> 1759.3799999999999
what I want I want that with my Dad I'm

1756.44 --> 1762.14
actually really eager

1759.38 --> 1765.2600000000002
to talk to him but it

1762.14 --> 1767.779
I got this feeling I don't know what the

1765.26 --> 1769.8799999999999
[ __ ] I did I really hope it's not

1767.779 --> 1771.08
because he's somehow disappointed in

1769.88 --> 1774.0800000000002
some way

1771.08 --> 1776.6789999999999
but he doesn't want that

1774.08 --> 1776.6789999999999
so

1777.08 --> 1783.74
yeah I mean my dad's like in his 70s I I

1780.86 --> 1786.74
want to call him almost every day

1783.74 --> 1789.44
but it just doesn't pick up

1786.74 --> 1791.6200000000001
and that feels pretty [ __ ] I can tell

1789.44 --> 1791.6200000000001
you

1798.08 --> 1802.52
like is everybody just avoiding me

1800.6 --> 1804.86
sometimes I wonder like my brothers

1802.52 --> 1808.12
hasn't called me ever

1804.86 --> 1808.12
in like 10 years

1808.46 --> 1813.02
nobody in my family like well now I have

1811.22 --> 1815.72
nobody can call me because I don't have

1813.02 --> 1818.899
an active telephone but I mean nobody

1815.72 --> 1822.52
ever [ __ ] contacts me ever

1818.899 --> 1822.52
about anything ever

1823.64 --> 1828.159
last person that actually contacted me

1828.32 --> 1833.299
besides my friend from namitha

1830.779 --> 1835.82
was like one of my ex-girlfriends

1833.299 --> 1837.559
remember that I brought up

1835.82 --> 1841.72
it's like

1837.559 --> 1841.72
after 20 years

1842.6 --> 1845.26
more

1847.22 --> 1851.659
that's like the only thing that ever

1848.96 --> 1854.0
happens it's like nobody likes to be in

1851.659 --> 1857.419
regular contact with me ever apparently

1854.0 --> 1859.7
it's like everybody avoids me like I'm

1857.419 --> 1861.679
literally hell

1859.7 --> 1863.3600000000001
because yeah you're a nice guy but if

1861.679 --> 1865.64
one we're gonna get in contact with you

1863.36 --> 1868.8799999999999
there's gonna be weird feelings and

1865.64 --> 1872.0590000000002
little little senses that normally don't

1868.88 --> 1874.3400000000001
light up but when we're with you Arwin

1872.059 --> 1876.2
everything starts to light up including

1874.34 --> 1878.6589999999999
the things we don't really know how to

1876.2 --> 1881.72
deal with so that's why we avoid you

1878.659 --> 1885.3990000000001
like you are the devil

1881.72 --> 1885.3990000000001
that's the feeling that I get

1896.98 --> 1901.76
right and it's not even like I'm

1899.6 --> 1905.059
instigating Panic or something or

1901.76 --> 1909.399
desperation not at all

1905.059 --> 1909.399
but despite that it's still like

1913.82 --> 1919.82
I mean I have a Daily Show here

1916.58 --> 1924.08
and literally nobody in my [ __ ]

1919.82 --> 1926.059
family even knows it's happening

1924.08 --> 1928.1589999999999
even though it's been going on for a

1926.059 --> 1932.4189999999999
decade or something

1928.159 --> 1935.24
like I know the profession of my nephew

1932.419 --> 1937.72
I know the profession of my brother like

1935.24 --> 1943.34
I know these things they don't know

1937.72 --> 1945.08
anything about me nothing they never say

1943.34 --> 1948.799
[ __ ] hello

1945.08 --> 1950.539
they never call me ever they never send

1948.799 --> 1953.2
me an email

1950.539 --> 1953.2
ever

1953.899 --> 1958.58
because they don't give a [ __ ] about me

1956.179 --> 1961.159
they're just waiting for me to die so

1958.58 --> 1963.6789999999999
they can forget about all of it again

1961.159 --> 1965.72
forget everything that I existed and all

1963.679 --> 1967.3990000000001
this crazy [ __ ] that I talked about that

1965.72 --> 1969.18
just made everybody really [ __ ]

1967.399 --> 1970.9599999999998
nervous all the time

1969.18 --> 1973.8200000000002
[Music]

1970.96 --> 1976.279
spooky all the dimensions yeah yeah just

1973.82 --> 1978.6399999999999
[ __ ] die Arwen and leave us alone in

1976.279 --> 1982.22
our [ __ ] ball tardated

1978.64 --> 1984.44
nonsense dream of reality we don't want

1982.22 --> 1986.59
to know anything about reality

1984.44 --> 1989.65
it's way too difficult

1986.59 --> 1989.6499999999999
[Music]

1990.5 --> 1995.0
my family is not really like the family

1992.899 --> 1997.4599999999998
for my mother's side isn't really into

1995.0 --> 2001.0
reality all that much

1997.46 --> 2004.0
they don't really care that much

2001.0 --> 2007.98
they're much more interested in what

2004.0 --> 2007.98
makes you seem like you're smart

2019.0 --> 2024.899
have they been avoiding you before you

2021.46 --> 2024.8990000000001
became Flat Earth yeah

2031.48 --> 2037.84
dude I've been avoided

2034.539 --> 2041.519
since I was freaking 10.

2037.84 --> 2041.519
I'm not even joking

2042.039 --> 2049.86
I have abandonment issues because of

2045.399 --> 2049.8599999999997
that because that's happened everywhere

2051.099 --> 2055.96
I even got that Sensation from my

2053.679 --> 2058.839
parents sometimes like they don't really

2055.96 --> 2060.879
cared about me

2058.839 --> 2064.06
that they just thought like I was a

2060.879 --> 2069.06
pathetic failure

2064.06 --> 2069.06
because they didn't really actually care

2077.44 --> 2084.3
yeah and family is not accidental or

2080.2 --> 2084.2999999999997
random in my opinion blue pill evolution

2084.339 --> 2089.859
family is

2086.379 --> 2092.5
also related to your soul

2089.859 --> 2094.899
there's family Souls that exists

2092.5 --> 2097.379
especially with people like me that

2094.899 --> 2097.379
exists

2097.42 --> 2104.2000000000003
and so there's absolutely no accident

2100.619 --> 2106.78
about who your family is at all

2104.2 --> 2107.7999999999997
and they're probably really on your

2106.78 --> 2110.6800000000003
nerves

2107.8 --> 2112.96
because of that

2110.68 --> 2116.68
you want to think of your family as

2112.96 --> 2119.8
random but you don't realize that

2116.68 --> 2123.54
your soul and their souls are probably

2119.8 --> 2123.54
connected Beyond his life

2126.04 --> 2132.66
and that you might have been on each

2128.32 --> 2132.6600000000003
other's nerves for thousands of years

2136.78 --> 2139.38
foreign

2143.079 --> 2151.78
do I ever reach out call my brother

2147.22 --> 2156.339
well I went to him like uh 10 years ago

2151.78 --> 2158.8590000000004
to basically give him my Legos

2156.339 --> 2161.2
or yeah the remnants of it the witch is

2158.859 --> 2162.8199999999997
the majority because his kids were at

2161.2 --> 2165.1189999999997
that age where they would appreciate

2162.82 --> 2165.119
that

2167.38 --> 2172.96
one time later too

2170.98 --> 2177.359
but

2172.96 --> 2177.359
no I haven't really heard of him since

2183.04 --> 2189.94
to be fair I think there's a really

2185.92 --> 2192.82
really high chance that whatever I bring

2189.94 --> 2194.2000000000003
up and I mean whatever whatever I'm

2192.82 --> 2196.78
gonna bring up

2194.2 --> 2198.9399999999996
that it's immediately gonna cost like a

2196.78 --> 2202.02
hassle socially

2198.94 --> 2202.02
within that family

2202.78 --> 2209.5600000000004
I just feel it it's like I feel they're

2205.9 --> 2212.859
all in over their heads with [ __ ]

2209.56 --> 2215.32
with societal [ __ ] that they don't

2212.859 --> 2218.339
really understand

2215.32 --> 2218.339
that's what I feel

2219.7 --> 2226.1189999999997
like I still technically don't even know

2222.94 --> 2228.64
like what his wife does I just know she

2226.119 --> 2231.339
works in a laboratory

2228.64 --> 2234.2799999999997
doing biological research yeah

2231.339 --> 2237.22
but I don't know what type

2234.28 --> 2239.7400000000002
at all I mean she could literally be

2237.22 --> 2241.8999999999996
like a main Labyrinth for Pfizer or

2239.74 --> 2246.7799999999997
something I'm not even joking that could

2241.9 --> 2246.78
literally be her profession I don't know

2246.82 --> 2249.599
look

2253.599 --> 2257.38
but whatever it is it's not gonna Bode

2256.06 --> 2260.14
any good

2257.38 --> 2262.92
it's not gonna be good

2260.14 --> 2266.2599999999998
not necessarily like

2262.92 --> 2268.66
intentionally evil but it's not gonna be

2266.26 --> 2270.1600000000003
good and that was always kind of the

2268.66 --> 2272.02
issue

2270.16 --> 2275.859
I didn't mean it's my brother's life man

2272.02 --> 2279.839
he wants that he chose it he does it he

2275.859 --> 2279.839
has the family he has the kids you know

2280.18 --> 2287.3199999999997
what do I got

2282.4 --> 2291.099
I got my Integrity I got my integrity

2287.32 --> 2294.1600000000003
and nothing and [ __ ] nothing except

2291.099 --> 2297.04
for well social community and

2294.16 --> 2298.5989999999997
yeah at least I got that

2297.04 --> 2302.88
but I mean

2298.599 --> 2302.88
all those other things I do not have

2303.52 --> 2308.859
like a proper income through a proper

2306.099 --> 2312.46
profession that actually provides the

2308.859 --> 2315.94
income for that profession yeah I have a

2312.46 --> 2318.46
specialism I have a profession but I'm

2315.94 --> 2320.32
not making any money out of it a very

2318.46 --> 2322.839
little bit

2320.32 --> 2325.3590000000004
right a little bit but I mean not enough

2322.839 --> 2327.22
to get me off social welfare is that

2325.359 --> 2331.02
really a profession

2327.22 --> 2331.02
is it just an out of control hobby

2332.74 --> 2337.2999999999997
yeah

2334.24 --> 2340.859
don't have a social life

2337.3 --> 2340.8590000000004
don't have relationships

2342.099 --> 2347.56
you got Nathan Oakley yes yeah I do at

2345.339 --> 2349.18
least I got that at least I got

2347.56 --> 2351.339
connection

2349.18 --> 2354.4199999999996
and at least I got

2351.339 --> 2359.619
connections with people that are really

2354.42 --> 2363.599
really good at things at certain things

2359.619 --> 2363.599
which is extremely helpful

2363.94 --> 2368.56
I'm very glad that to be friends with

2366.4 --> 2371.7400000000002
Nathan Oakley

2368.56 --> 2376.0
and to be part of fed to be the most

2371.74 --> 2379.2599999999998
senior panelist of fvd yes I am very

2376.0 --> 2379.26
very happy about that

2379.42 --> 2383.88
and it is quite valuable to me

2386.859 --> 2393.5989999999997
would have been great though if I'd

2388.359 --> 2393.5989999999997
actually had a life next to that though

2402.52 --> 2409.18
13 Nations have abolished

2405.88 --> 2411.54
agreed to abolish farming okay well I

2409.18 --> 2411.54
agree

2412.54 --> 2418.0
to basically

2415.3 --> 2420.3390000000004
I don't know

2418.0 --> 2424.3
starve out like

2420.339 --> 2426.339
starve out those people that agreed onto

2424.3 --> 2429.52
abolishing firing and like oh you agreed

2426.339 --> 2432.64
on abolishing farming do you okay

2429.52 --> 2435.64
we're gonna put you in a dungeon now

2432.64 --> 2438.2799999999997
where you will starve to death

2435.64 --> 2440.14
but I'm pretty sure there's enough rats

2438.28 --> 2443.079
and bugs going around that you could

2440.14 --> 2446.0789999999997
still prevent yourself from starving to

2443.079 --> 2448.98
death if you really wanted to

2446.079 --> 2448.98
yeah that's

2449.26 --> 2454.8390000000004
that's my response

2452.02 --> 2457.24
to the people that would agree upon

2454.839 --> 2459.46
abolishing farming

2457.24 --> 2462.72
put them in a dungeon and let them

2459.46 --> 2462.7200000000003
starve to death

2465.86 --> 2468.9190000000003
[Music]

2477.52 --> 2481.9
guess eating is over right yeah well

2479.8 --> 2485.5
it's cool you know if they're for that

2481.9 --> 2488.02
no more farming cool then you don't get

2485.5 --> 2491.68
to eat anymore

2488.02 --> 2495.88
yeah you now have a permanent

2491.68 --> 2499.54
Market ban as in register those people

2495.88 --> 2503.079
that voted on that and then they're not

2499.54 --> 2506.579
allowed to be sold

2503.079 --> 2506.579
food anymore

2506.859 --> 2512.2599999999998
yeah how about that it's like oh oh you

2510.28 --> 2514.2400000000002
vote for no more farming okay well then

2512.26 --> 2517.7200000000003
you don't get any more food you little

2514.24 --> 2520.5989999999997
[ __ ] now go and starve to death

2517.72 --> 2522.9399999999996
nobody's gonna miss you you useless

2520.599 --> 2525.6400000000003
piece of [ __ ]

2522.94 --> 2527.38
that's not even worth a piece of [ __ ]

2525.64 --> 2531.339
because a piece of [ __ ] could be

2527.38 --> 2533.8
fermented and then be used for soil to

2531.339 --> 2536.68
grow crops with

2533.8 --> 2538.6600000000003
which people need to survive yeah you

2536.68 --> 2542.44
don't deserve any of that because you

2538.66 --> 2544.54
voted against farming

2542.44 --> 2545.859
compost them

2544.54 --> 2547.839
yeah

2545.859 --> 2550.359
Maybe

2547.839 --> 2552.72
they're shriveled up starved corpses

2550.359 --> 2552.72
Maybe

2561.579 --> 2566.44
are we you have said yeah I know I say

2564.46 --> 2569.04
that I say that all the time that's why

2566.44 --> 2569.04
I'm saying

2569.14 --> 2575.5
those people that abolish farming

2572.98 --> 2579.4
with their that agree upon that should

2575.5 --> 2582.72
all be put in a dungeon and then left to

2579.4 --> 2582.7200000000003
starve to death

2595.119 --> 2601.3
what's the replacement for farming there

2597.7 --> 2603.9399999999996
isn't a replacement for farming

2601.3 --> 2605.7400000000002
a replacement for farming is starving to

2603.94 --> 2608.5
death

2605.74 --> 2611.74
or eating something toxic that is

2608.5 --> 2614.2
supposed to mimic food

2611.74 --> 2616.2999999999997
to your senses that will literally

2614.2 --> 2619.4199999999996
poison you and

2616.3 --> 2620.92
literally make you blow up and die very

2619.42 --> 2624.119
quickly

2620.92 --> 2624.119
like fake meat

2627.099 --> 2633.339
yep

2629.2 --> 2636.339
so you got bugs you got 3D printed fake

2633.339 --> 2639.16
meat and you got Soylent Green

2636.339 --> 2641.56
yeah 3D printed meat is not soil and

2639.16 --> 2645.16
green Soylent Green is corpses 3D

2641.56 --> 2648.2999999999997
printed meat is cancer growth

2645.16 --> 2648.2999999999997
it's not the same

2649.0 --> 2653.68
it's actually Soylent Green is better

2651.22 --> 2656.02
for your health yeah I said it

2653.68 --> 2658.4199999999996
that's right silent green is going to be

2656.02 --> 2662.2
better for your health than 3D printed

2658.42 --> 2664.78
meat because Soylent Green at least was

2662.2 --> 2666.93
originally real meat that's the

2664.78 --> 2668.6800000000003
difference

2666.93 --> 2671.6189999999997
[Music]

2668.68 --> 2674.859
yeah so that's right when you get the

2671.619 --> 2677.5
bugs the fake meat and the soil and

2674.859 --> 2682.18
greens Soylent Green is going to be the

2677.5 --> 2685.079
luxury food option yeah you get it yet

2682.18 --> 2685.0789999999997
this is

2697.9 --> 2706.3
a petition to abolish farming subsidies

2702.88 --> 2708.94
seven signatures wow

2706.3 --> 2712.54
well I'm glad that the majority of

2708.94 --> 2716.04
Britain of the UK did not agree to that

2712.54 --> 2716.04
because it's idiotic

2718.96 --> 2725.859
I mean I think it's even kind of

2721.78 --> 2728.92
ridiculous calling it subsidies

2725.859 --> 2731.02
it's not subsidies

2728.92 --> 2736.48
it's tax

2731.02 --> 2737.619
its tax of the non-farmer people to the

2736.48 --> 2741.28
farmers

2737.619 --> 2744.6400000000003
the tax they need to pay because if they

2741.28 --> 2747.2400000000002
don't they'll [ __ ] starve to death

2744.64 --> 2751.1189999999997
yeah so it's the

2747.24 --> 2754.18
anti-starvation tax to the farmers it's

2751.119 --> 2758.2000000000003
not subsidies it's tax

2754.18 --> 2761.56
because the farmers own you if they

2758.2 --> 2763.5989999999997
didn't Farm you die

2761.56 --> 2767.2799999999997
it's attacks

2763.599 --> 2769.92
this subsidies is just a bunch of

2767.28 --> 2772.42
government-centric [ __ ]

2769.92 --> 2775.66
reinterpretations like oh no the farmers

2772.42 --> 2779.02
we're under control for oh we will give

2775.66 --> 2783.04
you the money all the government gave

2779.02 --> 2785.619
the farmers the money oh yeah no no it

2783.04 --> 2789.52
they if they don't get that money you

2785.619 --> 2792.579
all [ __ ] die yeah it's taxes it's tax

2789.52 --> 2795.24
to the farmer it's not subsidies

2792.579 --> 2799.2400000000002
yeah

2795.24 --> 2802.5989999999997
they are a government of food

2799.24 --> 2806.02
and if you don't pay your taxes to them

2802.599 --> 2809.7000000000003
you starve to death

2806.02 --> 2809.7
it's not subsidies

2810.099 --> 2816.599
that's just a bunch of government

2812.88 --> 2816.599
bureaucrat talk

2824.74 --> 2830.02
yes logical conclusion I know I'm I'm

2827.74 --> 2831.64
not making the point against you I'm

2830.02 --> 2835.3
just making the point because you

2831.64 --> 2838.1189999999997
brought the subject up that's all

2835.3 --> 2839.8590000000004
yeah if I'm getting all passionate over

2838.119 --> 2840.88
something somebody's bringing up in the

2839.859 --> 2843.46
chat

2840.88 --> 2845.98
then please don't think I'm attacking

2843.46 --> 2847.48
you you just brought up a subject it got

2845.98 --> 2849.64
me passionate

2847.48 --> 2852.76
I'm not attacking you

2849.64 --> 2857.339
when I do that unless I specifically say

2852.76 --> 2857.3390000000004
your name and then I am

2857.38 --> 2862.78
but if I don't do that then you really

2859.78 --> 2866.2200000000003
have nothing to worry about don't feel

2862.78 --> 2866.2200000000003
personally targeted

2872.44 --> 2877.2400000000002
farming subsidies are criminal what

2875.56 --> 2880.2
the foreign are you talking about

2877.24 --> 2880.2
seeking star water

2880.48 --> 2885.339
that's not how it works at all farming

2883.599 --> 2888.1600000000003
subsidies are

2885.339 --> 2892.44
so they can keep

2888.16 --> 2892.44
it up at the highest level

2894.339 --> 2898.359
what the [ __ ] you mean farming subsidies

2896.8 --> 2901.38
are Criminal

2898.359 --> 2901.38
how are they Criminal

2902.92 --> 2906.11
[Music]

2917.14 --> 2921.46
and what like where are you getting that

2919.18 --> 2923.9199999999996
pay them not to grow

2921.46 --> 2926.28
Farmers don't get subsidies not to grow

2923.92 --> 2926.28
things

2930.94 --> 2937.48
problems are paid to leave Fields fallow

2934.0 --> 2940.26
well that's just called crop rotation so

2937.48 --> 2940.26
you can start water

2948.119 --> 2953.88
environmentalists oh wow okay that's

2950.859 --> 2953.88
ridiculous though

2954.16 --> 2960.5789999999997
I mean I've never even heard of that

2956.2 --> 2963.72
like subsidies so they don't form

2960.579 --> 2963.7200000000003
that's [ __ ] up

2966.46 --> 2970.78
I mean what the hell kind of farmer are

2968.619 --> 2973.5
you if you're gonna take money to not do

2970.78 --> 2973.5
your job

2973.54 --> 2976.319
that's crazy

2990.22 --> 2992.7
what

3002.4 --> 3009.38
yeah okay Farren that does just straight

3005.94 --> 3009.38
out seem criminal then

3009.54 --> 3014.099
I think that should be a trend that

3011.4 --> 3017.4
should be abolished internationally like

3014.099 --> 3018.839
how [ __ ] dare you

3017.4 --> 3022.5
okay

3018.839 --> 3028.04
money to professionals to not do their

3022.5 --> 3028.04
job that should be universally illegal

3029.4 --> 3036.7200000000003
like what the [ __ ] kind of deal is this

3033.18 --> 3040.9199999999996
you pay through government taxes no less

3036.72 --> 3043.9199999999996
you pay a professional specifically to

3040.92 --> 3047.16
not do their job

3043.92 --> 3049.6800000000003
there is literally no possible

3047.16 --> 3051.92
conceivable benefit that can come from

3049.68 --> 3051.9199999999996
that

3052.14 --> 3057.2
it should be universally illegal

3059.22 --> 3065.5789999999997
like with any profession to get paid not

3062.819 --> 3068.4
to do your profession should be illegal

3065.579 --> 3071.3590000000004
default doesn't even matter what the

3068.4 --> 3071.359
[ __ ] profession is

3076.079 --> 3078.079
um

3082.5 --> 3087.079
keeping prices I yeah probably

3105.3 --> 3110.52
you think it's good there is a better

3107.7 --> 3112.64
you just explained out did you know Amy

3110.52 --> 3112.64
yes

3114.119 --> 3117.5
what did you explain

3119.0 --> 3125.18
environmentally sensitive or

3120.96 --> 3125.18
environmentally sensitive to what

3148.079 --> 3153.78
it's very simple either you farm in an

3151.559 --> 3156.8390000000004
area because it's suitable for farming

3153.78 --> 3159.9
or you don't Farm in an area because

3156.839 --> 3162.74
it's not suitable for farming

3159.9 --> 3162.7400000000002
that's it

3164.819 --> 3170.7599999999998
now governments can just out of nowhere

3167.4 --> 3173.819
start to designate the ground as oh this

3170.76 --> 3176.0400000000004
is environmentally sensitive

3173.819 --> 3178.88
yeah like our [ __ ] government is

3176.04 --> 3182.2799999999997
doing saying that oh nitrogen pollution

3178.88 --> 3184.6800000000003
total [ __ ] yeah

3182.28 --> 3186.119
total [ __ ] also environmentally

3184.68 --> 3188.2799999999997
sensitive now

3186.119 --> 3191.28
and they're even spouting nonsense like

3188.28 --> 3195.5
oh we're gonna make nature reclaim it

3191.28 --> 3195.5
like are you [ __ ] out of your mind

3205.02 --> 3208.74
I wish government would pay me not to

3207.0 --> 3211.079
form well then you'd have to become a

3208.74 --> 3213.4799999999996
farmer get good enough to actually farm

3211.079 --> 3214.92
and then you can get paid to literally

3213.48 --> 3217.26
do nothing

3214.92 --> 3219.66
but you have to actually be capable of

3217.26 --> 3221.9
farming before you can get paid to do

3219.66 --> 3221.8999999999996
nothing

3224.76 --> 3229.5200000000004
maybe I should become a farmer I mean

3230.94 --> 3236.099
if I could be a farmer and not be paid

3233.28 --> 3237.78
be paid to not be a farmer well then I'd

3236.099 --> 3240.38
have all the time in the world and get

3237.78 --> 3240.38
paid for it

3240.54 --> 3245.7799999999997
but yeah I wouldn't do that because it's

3242.88 --> 3245.78
[ __ ] [ __ ]

3258.9 --> 3262.079
[Music]

3264.559 --> 3270.289
good morning

3267.09 --> 3270.289
[Music]

3277.74 --> 3282.24
how does it make sense to make the cars

3280.02 --> 3284.099
and throw the milk down the drain uh

3282.24 --> 3286.68
because there's just too much of it here

3284.099 --> 3288.48
we go again but I mean it's not good to

3286.68 --> 3292.64
throw it down the drain

3288.48 --> 3292.64
it's better to just compost it

3293.22 --> 3300.0
I mean in the sewers that's a complete

3296.339 --> 3302.819
waste that is that's Criminal

3300.0 --> 3305.52
to just throw it literally down the

3302.819 --> 3307.859
drain but I mean if you could just throw

3305.52 --> 3310.2599999999998
it on your compost or whatever

3307.859 --> 3311.5789999999997
there's plenty of nutritious stuff in

3310.26 --> 3315.1400000000003
there

3311.579 --> 3315.1400000000003
that can be recycled

3320.099 --> 3324.059
it's like another Marathon three hours

3322.14 --> 3326.339
but no

3324.059 --> 3330.0
not not today

3326.339 --> 3332.16
but yeah thanks for for being here

3330.0 --> 3334.02
I'm basically continuing because Nathan

3332.16 --> 3337.22
isn't

3334.02 --> 3337.22
showing up yet

3340.8 --> 3346.3390000000004
plants depend on co2 yeah and it is

3343.14 --> 3346.339
intoxicating indeed

3350.88 --> 3357.599
yeah now CRT is actually an invaluable

3354.059 --> 3360.599
resource if you're like into

3357.599 --> 3360.599
greenhouses

3360.839 --> 3367.5
I mean CO2 is the bomb it's awesome you

3364.559 --> 3369.059
can literally have CO2 get pumped into

3367.5 --> 3372.599
your Greenhouse

3369.059 --> 3376.1400000000003
to make your plants grow quicker

3372.599 --> 3378.96
like measurably bigger

3376.14 --> 3380.7599999999998
and there's no leakage or whatever like

3378.96 --> 3381.86
it's just gonna be absorbed by those

3380.76 --> 3385.239
plants

3381.86 --> 3385.239
[Music]

3396.18 --> 3402.2599999999998
over forming

3399.3 --> 3402.26
a big sure

3405.119 --> 3412.2000000000003
yeah okay but that's just because it's

3409.5 --> 3414.059
it's strip farming

3412.2 --> 3416.64
right

3414.059 --> 3420.38
it's like strip mining but it's for

3416.64 --> 3420.3799999999997
farming it's strip farming it's

3420.599 --> 3429.059
too much trying to force it out

3425.579 --> 3431.7000000000003
right so if you don't do crop rotation

3429.059 --> 3433.2000000000003
you're gonna end up strip farming it's

3431.7 --> 3436.14
gonna deplete the ground it's gonna

3433.2 --> 3439.2
destroy the soil etc etc you that's the

3436.14 --> 3442.16
[ __ ] it's the problem with farming

3439.2 --> 3445.859
is that the really primitive

3442.16 --> 3449.64
old-fashioned type farming is just not

3445.859 --> 3452.52
considerate not careful enough

3449.64 --> 3455.46
a real farmer should know balance with

3452.52 --> 3457.559
nature is know that you can't keep just

3455.46 --> 3459.78
exploiting the ground over and over

3457.559 --> 3463.619
again that it's gonna die

3459.78 --> 3465.059
a real educated farmer should absolutely

3463.619 --> 3468.2400000000002
know that

3465.059 --> 3470.94
that's why any real educated farmer

3468.24 --> 3475.319
should be an organic farmer because

3470.94 --> 3479.2400000000002
that's that's the entire [ __ ] point

3475.319 --> 3479.24
of being an organic farmer

3479.7 --> 3485.339
is to be durable to have it be better

3482.579 --> 3487.619
quality and to have the life

3485.339 --> 3489.96
in the grand the ground

3487.619 --> 3494.1800000000003
restore

3489.96 --> 3494.18
to grow better not worse

3495.119 --> 3500.04
so over farming it's purely because of

3497.88 --> 3503.099
ignorance and greed that that happens

3500.04 --> 3505.319
she's like no just force the product out

3503.099 --> 3508.04
get the money out of the ground and then

3505.319 --> 3508.04
[ __ ] the ground

3508.5 --> 3513.599
that's strip farming

3511.619 --> 3516.059
that's really bad that's the

3513.599 --> 3518.1800000000003
environmental destruction

3516.059 --> 3520.799
but guess what

3518.18 --> 3525.0789999999997
there's so much freaking information

3520.799 --> 3528.599
about how to not do it like that now

3525.079 --> 3532.7400000000002
there's so much information

3528.599 --> 3536.1600000000003
that even like the Amish have like super

3532.74 --> 3538.9399999999996
high tear organic farming knowledge now

3536.16 --> 3538.94
okay

3539.22 --> 3547.859
it's no more need to do the stupid ass

3544.2 --> 3549.5989999999997
strip farming you don't need to do that

3547.859 --> 3552.619
anymore

3549.599 --> 3556.799
the only reason to do that is to be

3552.619 --> 3559.319
greedy on purpose to be greedy and a

3556.799 --> 3561.78
saboteur to like oh let's trip it up and

3559.319 --> 3565.5589999999997
then just burn it all yeah that's the

3561.78 --> 3568.26
only [ __ ] reason to do farming in

3565.559 --> 3569.88
that old-fashioned way strip farming is

3568.26 --> 3572.2400000000002
what I'm calling it I don't think it has

3569.88 --> 3572.2400000000002
a name

3572.28 --> 3578.7000000000003
nobody needs to do that ever

3575.819 --> 3581.04
and this climate called [ __ ] is

3578.7 --> 3583.2599999999998
playing into that nonsense like

3581.04 --> 3584.2799999999997
everybody's still a strip farmer they're

3583.26 --> 3587.96
not

3584.28 --> 3587.96
we've gotten over that

3588.72 --> 3593.04
most Farmers aren't like that anymore

3591.059 --> 3595.7400000000002
the ones that do

3593.04 --> 3597.359
usually end up failing because they end

3595.74 --> 3599.339
up ruining their ground you're not just

3597.359 --> 3600.54
gonna buy new ground with your failed

3599.339 --> 3602.22
Farm

3600.54 --> 3606.0589999999997
yeah

3602.22 --> 3608.8799999999997
they'll just [ __ ] off

3606.059 --> 3611.3390000000004
or die or go bust

3608.88 --> 3613.1400000000003
whatever change profession I would

3611.339 --> 3615.42
probably do

3613.14 --> 3616.74
if they were really insistent on farming

3615.42 --> 3618.2400000000002
like that

3616.74 --> 3622.4599999999996
but

3618.24 --> 3622.4599999999996
there's no need for it at all

3622.819 --> 3627.5
fertilizer runoff and everybody yeah

3625.2 --> 3627.5
well

3627.839 --> 3633.42
you you can handle

3630.619 --> 3636.6600000000003
fertilizer very differently yeah you

3633.42 --> 3639.48
don't need to like maximize the amount

3636.66 --> 3641.7
of fertilizer every freaking time

3639.48 --> 3643.2
if you don't want runoff

3641.7 --> 3647.0589999999997
well

3643.2 --> 3647.0589999999997
make another system then

3649.98 --> 3655.799
prevent runoff right I mean you're not

3653.04 --> 3659.46
gonna get runoff

3655.799 --> 3664.28
if you basically got your farming worked

3659.46 --> 3664.28
in a way where it can't run off

3666.119 --> 3670.7400000000002
like if you basically use everything

3668.16 --> 3674.42
potted in a potted system

3670.74 --> 3676.8799999999997
or like a separated just a piece of dirt

3674.42 --> 3680.099
that's lifted

3676.88 --> 3681.42
separated from the rest guess what

3680.099 --> 3684.42
everything that's going to go in there

3681.42 --> 3686.46
is not gonna run off

3684.42 --> 3688.619
because it can't run off it's not open

3686.46 --> 3690.66
ground then yeah it's another way of

3688.619 --> 3694.079
farming

3690.66 --> 3698.66
it's very efficient that way

3694.079 --> 3698.6600000000003
no pollution no runoff

3706.92 --> 3714.0
right and besides oh too much nitrogen

3709.799 --> 3718.079
oh no yeah there's some temporary

3714.0 --> 3721.38
in balance it might create but I mean

3718.079 --> 3725.2200000000003
it's literally the most useful component

3721.38 --> 3726.6600000000003
in nature so oh the extra nitrogen you

3725.22 --> 3728.5789999999997
know guess what is Nature's just gonna

3726.66 --> 3730.98
be like ah gear give it air give it here

3728.579 --> 3732.96
every single time

3730.98 --> 3736.26
everything it's just gonna like create

3732.96 --> 3738.48
algae blooms and all kinds of weeds that

3736.26 --> 3742.099
are just gonna go ballistic that's

3738.48 --> 3742.099
basically just what happens

3746.28 --> 3750.5400000000004
Sri Lanka tried to do only organic

3749.46 --> 3755.66
farming

3750.54 --> 3755.66
yeah well they're not there yet then

3757.799 --> 3762.799
I mean you have to actually have the

3760.44 --> 3762.799
soil

3763.319 --> 3768.24
if you try organic farming and then you

3766.2 --> 3770.2799999999997
give up on it you go back to the old

3768.24 --> 3772.9799999999996
method you're just gonna make it worse

3770.28 --> 3776.2200000000003
and worse and worse again yeah the whole

3772.98 --> 3780.42
point is like no you have to keep it up

3776.22 --> 3784.14
and then like make the soil better and

3780.42 --> 3787.079
better and better and then suddenly

3784.14 --> 3790.04
the organic farming starts to really

3787.079 --> 3790.04
really yield

3791.46 --> 3796.92
it takes some time

3793.74 --> 3800.16
it takes a lot of organization

3796.92 --> 3803.299
and like careful planning and knowledge

3800.16 --> 3803.299
on soil

3815.7 --> 3819.859
LG Bloom yeah yeah I know

3819.96 --> 3825.2400000000002
cane sugar produces and that yeah but

3823.02 --> 3829.079
that's because the cane sugar industry

3825.24 --> 3832.3999999999996
is is really like a

3829.079 --> 3832.4
wait I call it earlier

3839.04 --> 3844.819
whatever what the [ __ ] did I call it

3842.16 --> 3844.819
sort of

3848.76 --> 3853.7400000000002
damn it I forgot the damn word for it

3851.579 --> 3856.26
and nobody ever [ __ ] repeats anything

3853.74 --> 3862.04
I ever say in this goddamn

3856.26 --> 3862.0400000000004
show so what the [ __ ] did I call it

3869.66 --> 3879.1189999999997
did anybody in the chat pay attention

3875.04 --> 3881.16
what did I call it that bad type of

3879.119 --> 3883.94
farming it was a type of farming what

3881.16 --> 3883.94
did I call it

3886.38 --> 3891.059
this is a question to you people in the

3889.2 --> 3893.339
chat right now

3891.059 --> 3897.42
to see if you have any kind of memory

3893.339 --> 3899.339
yet whatsoever I certainly don't seem to

3897.42 --> 3901.559
because I can't remember what I call it

3899.339 --> 3903.42
strip farming there you go

3901.559 --> 3906.5
finally

3903.42 --> 3906.5
there you go yeah

3907.26 --> 3912.48
thank you yes yes yes

3911.04 --> 3915.54
I got it

3912.48 --> 3918.599
you got it good don't know why I forgot

3915.54 --> 3923.0589999999997
that but strip farming is a good word

3918.599 --> 3923.059
I'm gonna put that in the title I think

3923.94 --> 3930.18
yeah

3925.7 --> 3935.64
sugarcane [ __ ] they're strip farmers

3930.18 --> 3937.5
I mean what cane sugar is already like a

3935.64 --> 3940.6189999999997
dubious crop

3937.5 --> 3943.26
because of the toxic it's literally

3940.619 --> 3946.26
toxic [ __ ]

3943.26 --> 3946.26
so

3949.559 --> 3957.26
you can do organic sugar farming by the

3953.579 --> 3960.6600000000003
way it's just not as rampant profits

3957.26 --> 3963.78
that's all but you can definitely do it

3960.66 --> 3968.0989999999997
organically which is much better not

3963.78 --> 3969.96
strip farming there is Organic Grown

3968.099 --> 3973.079
cane sugar

3969.96 --> 3976.92
in the store it literally does taste

3973.079 --> 3976.92
better by the way literally

4001.579 --> 4004.579
foreign

4004.61 --> 4009.069
[Music]

4026.29 --> 4029.349
[Music]

4039.54 --> 4046.219
[Music]

4060.68 --> 4065.0589999999997
but yeah fertilizer runoffs are

4063.319 --> 4068.359
problematic

4065.059 --> 4069.92
that's why it should be avoided and it's

4068.359 --> 4072.74
the whole point is is that it's

4069.92 --> 4074.839
pointless like to have runoff is

4072.74 --> 4078.5589999999997
literally a waste

4074.839 --> 4080.359
to have runoff is literally a waste of

4078.559 --> 4082.28
the stuff

4080.359 --> 4085.64
that you're throwing on there because

4082.28 --> 4088.76
you want it in there you want the plants

4085.64 --> 4090.98
to absorb it not it to run off

4088.76 --> 4093.0200000000004
so it's literally a complete waste that

4090.98 --> 4096.5
that even happens

4093.02 --> 4098.56
runoff should never need to happen

4096.5 --> 4103.179
if you properly

4098.56 --> 4103.179
organized your entire Farm

4111.319 --> 4115.219
do you guys see that do you understand

4113.48 --> 4117.678999999999
that

4115.219 --> 4120.04
that runoff should never need to happen

4117.679 --> 4120.04
ever

4138.38 --> 4142.2390000000005
they burn the cane fields

4148.46 --> 4153.58
yeah that stuff

4151.339 --> 4153.58
foreign

4177.46 --> 4182.199
level it out so it doesn't have runoff

4188.719 --> 4192.339
yes of course

4195.71 --> 4198.84
[Music]

4206.9 --> 4212.36
but yeah there I mean maybe just for the

4210.56 --> 4216.52
biggest skill farming it's almost

4212.36 --> 4216.5199999999995
impossible to really deal with it

4218.66 --> 4223.82
but on a smaller scale you could

4220.699 --> 4226.239
definitely completely avoid all forms of

4223.82 --> 4226.239
runoff

4226.34 --> 4228.9400000000005
foreign

4229.52 --> 4234.080000000001
like

4230.96 --> 4236.9
when you have like an archery or like to

4234.08 --> 4240.86
have a vegetable garden

4236.9 --> 4243.139999999999
in a greenhouse you don't have runoff

4240.86 --> 4245.0
like ever

4243.14 --> 4249.76
because where's it gonna run off to it's

4245.0 --> 4249.76
basically pots pots don't have runoff

4249.98 --> 4254.199
it just stays within it you see

4259.76 --> 4266.659000000001
it's because you have open ground

4263.719 --> 4268.76
like a giant Acres of ground

4266.659 --> 4270.5599999999995
that's what's going to cost a runoff

4268.76 --> 4273.1990000000005
it's like the water and whatever it's

4270.56 --> 4275.06
taking it with it yeah it can go deeper

4273.199 --> 4278.299999999999
and deeper and deeper in the groundwater

4275.06 --> 4282.320000000001
right it's gonna go to a place other

4278.3 --> 4285.02
than where it's supposed to be that's

4282.32 --> 4289.219
a bit of a hazard that's the D issue

4285.02 --> 4291.320000000001
with big farming like that

4289.219 --> 4293.679
if you do it a little smaller you don't

4291.32 --> 4295.5199999999995
have those issues because you can all

4293.679 --> 4298.76
keep it

4295.52 --> 4303.64
basically potted make sure that there is

4298.76 --> 4303.64
no runoff in the Deep ground like that

4307.58 --> 4313.34
yeah yeah exactly yeah if there's a lot

4310.82 --> 4317.199
of rainfall if there's floods basically

4313.34 --> 4317.1990000000005
yeah then you can't prevent runoff

4317.48 --> 4321.339999999999
unless you're in a greenhouse

4321.98 --> 4325.959999999999
because greenhouses have roofs

4362.08 --> 4366.699
fertilizer is expensive and you're

4364.76 --> 4371.0
sparingly is it though

4366.699 --> 4373.879999999999
here at Sanford is it really that much

4371.0 --> 4376.699
but yeah you are right about the highly

4373.88 --> 4378.62
organized part yeah

4376.699 --> 4382.699
I mean the biggest

4378.62 --> 4385.58
profit comes in how well you get the

4382.699 --> 4388.5199999999995
farming process and organize it

4385.58 --> 4390.739
that's modern farming indeed it's really

4388.52 --> 4394.179
about the organization and the oversight

4390.739 --> 4394.178999999999
and this having a system

4402.94 --> 4407.799999999999
okay

4404.9 --> 4407.799999999999
hmm

4410.0 --> 4415.12
okay I guess there's not gonna be a live

4412.219 --> 4415.12
fed today

4416.9 --> 4421.58
Nathan turned on a Premiere I don't know

4419.3 --> 4423.0

interesting

4470.84 --> 4478.12
I do

4473.26 --> 4478.12
the chat seems a bit slow though

4479.6 --> 4484.46
they pause a five minutes straight

4482.78 --> 4486.699
it's always a bit worrying when that

4484.46 --> 4486.699
happens

4501.46 --> 4507.14
let's just refresh because sometimes the

4504.679 --> 4510.02
chat just stops

4507.14 --> 4512.96
flowing for no reason

4510.02 --> 4514.820000000001
is it a mechanical error

4512.96 --> 4517.78
nope

4514.82 --> 4517.78
all right

4533.6 --> 4539.780000000001

4535.88 --> 4541.6990000000005
