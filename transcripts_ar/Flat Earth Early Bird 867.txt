compared to the last week

90.96 --> 98.24
and it's almost wind still as well it's

94.74 --> 98.24
like really warm out there

99.54 --> 102.43900000000001
look at that

107.04 --> 111.38000000000001

116.759 --> 119.96
quite enjoyable

122.28 --> 130.799

123.68 --> 130.799
it's Sunday the 18th of April 2021.

132.06 --> 135.2
green tea

143.66 --> 151.739
and I feel very well rested

149.28 --> 153.72
went to bed pretty early again last

151.739 --> 154.8
night hello

153.72 --> 158.599
yeah

154.8 --> 158.59900000000002
and like slept great

159.12 --> 165.36
so I feel all nice and rested

162.72 --> 166.98
I think I slept like combined 10 hours

165.36 --> 168.239
or something

166.98 --> 170.76
so

168.239 --> 172.739
yeah

170.76 --> 176.16
I feel nice

172.739 --> 177.84
hey hello Cameron Kamikaze Gilmore first

176.16 --> 181.319
in chat

177.84 --> 183.5
see unders also in chat good to see you

181.319 --> 183.5
both

192.659 --> 199.819
it's kind of funny I thought like at the

196.14 --> 202.07999999999998
at the church over there

199.819 --> 203.819
saw two

202.08 --> 206.28
um

203.819 --> 207.56
Elders as they call it from the Mormon

206.28 --> 211.64000000000001
church

207.56 --> 211.64000000000001
throwing back and forth of football

212.04 --> 215.819
like in American football so that was

214.14 --> 217.73899999999998
kind of funny that's something you don't

215.819 --> 219.89999999999998
often see

217.739 --> 222.959
it's just funny to see that

219.9 --> 226.68
but yeah so there's still activity there

222.959 --> 229.26
I don't know there's no real Gathering

226.68 --> 231.959
haven't seen a gathering like all year

229.26 --> 234.89999999999998
since the corona situation happened

231.959 --> 237.12
but they do come there and do things

234.9 --> 241.92000000000002
probably like

237.12 --> 244.31900000000002
autisms and other things I don't know

241.92 --> 247.14
but that side was pretty funny

244.319 --> 249.73899999999998
something you don't see very often here

247.14 --> 249.73899999999998
anyway

255.9 --> 260.78000000000003
hey good servant good to see you

282.24 --> 286.56
right so this is overall gonna be it

284.699 --> 289.22
taking it easy show

286.56 --> 289.22
I think

290.94 --> 293.94
ah

294.18 --> 298.5
yeah yesterday after the Flat Earth

296.04 --> 300.6
early bird show

298.5 --> 304.16
I did

300.6 --> 304.16
yeah basically hang around

304.44 --> 308.28
huh

306.36 --> 310.5
yeah there was no live ball busters or

308.28 --> 313.38
anything so I kind of like just hung

310.5 --> 316.32
around letter the bed chats

313.38 --> 319.74
and watch them finished up watching

316.32 --> 321.36
season two of stranger things

319.74 --> 323.46000000000004
uh

321.36 --> 327.259
was really good watching that all back

323.46 --> 327.25899999999996
again it's it is pretty intense

328.979 --> 333.78
and yeah there's so many really

331.259 --> 335.40000000000003
interesting characters that really stood

333.78 --> 337.979
out to me during this series is like

335.4 --> 340.919
that all the characters are like

337.979 --> 342.96
have likable Dynamics

340.919 --> 345.9
like even the ones that are supposed to

342.96 --> 348.56
be the bad ones have likable traits and

345.9 --> 348.56
yeah so

349.02 --> 355.52
it's just

351.419 --> 355.52
yeah it is a really good series

355.86 --> 362.28000000000003
felt well crafted

358.38 --> 364.56
and the music is also just very good

362.28 --> 368.05999999999995
uh

364.56 --> 368.06
so that was good watching that

368.58 --> 371.24
uh

373.74 --> 378.86
tumeric coffee tomorrow oh you drink

376.02 --> 378.85999999999996
Tamara coffee

378.9 --> 384.12
I these days I put a little turmeric not

382.02 --> 385.31899999999996
as much as I used to but it put little

384.12 --> 389.84000000000003
turmeric

385.319 --> 389.84000000000003
in my coffee again in my morning coffee

389.94 --> 394.319
it's just not so much that it kind of

392.039 --> 397.139
like completely changes around the taste

394.319 --> 400.38
but that you can still taste it in there

397.139 --> 403.40000000000003
I've been doing that for now for a week

400.38 --> 403.4
and yeah

404.699 --> 410.22
it's pretty good

407.52 --> 412.58
feels good I look tired now I'm not

410.22 --> 412.58000000000004
tired

414.78 --> 418.52
hey Ralph Rodriguez

420.419 --> 427.69899999999996
good morning from La must be early

423.24 --> 427.699
over there what is it like seven o'clock

435.12 --> 438.9
Gabriel Donato

440.58 --> 443.0
hello

447.599 --> 451.46
5am oh [Â __Â ]

453.66 --> 458.28000000000003
you're in Brazil Gabriel Donato all

456.599 --> 461.0
right

458.28 --> 461.0
hmm

472.139 --> 477.5
that's odd that it will be like four

474.599 --> 477.5
hours ahead

483.06 --> 487.879
anyway

485.699 --> 487.879
foreign

488.4 --> 493.099
got an audience from all over the world

490.5 --> 493.099
these days

496.08 --> 501.37899999999996
uh

498.599 --> 501.37899999999996
so

503.819 --> 509.819
right as for like Flat Earth

506.879 --> 512.339
TV like last thing I remember I was in

509.819 --> 514.019
chat going at some really annoying chat

512.339 --> 516.5
trolls over at the Flat Earth debates

514.019 --> 516.5
chat

516.659 --> 519.5
uh

521.099 --> 530.1800000000001
also the Skype feed has been going

525.779 --> 530.18
it's a new situation and rolling

532.86 --> 537.14
apparently involving ranty as well

540.72 --> 545.48
but yeah we'll see what that turns into

550.62 --> 554.0600000000001
beautiful Horizon really

559.5 --> 564.019
huh

560.64 --> 564.019
which city is that

578.399 --> 583.68
Bello Horizonte really

581.16 --> 587.0
huh all right didn't know there was such

583.68 --> 587.0
a place that yeah

587.76 --> 594.0
yeah I can read that into that that's

590.839 --> 597.44
very obvious what that's going to mean

594.0 --> 597.44
in English huh

599.76 --> 605.519
I mean this grace

603.0 --> 610.519
all right

605.519 --> 610.519
yeah Brazil's a really big country so

617.519 --> 623.42
the biggest country in South America

619.399 --> 623.42
from what I've seen

626.1 --> 629.779
old maps that is

633.66 --> 638.519
all right so yeah

636.48 --> 640.5600000000001
I'm pretty much

638.519 --> 643.44
as I said laid back

640.56 --> 646.9399999999999
but I am open for subjects talking about

643.44 --> 646.94
whatever oh man

659.579 --> 663.92
nice nuts wet nuts

673.2 --> 676.1600000000001
oh right

690.899 --> 696.8
hey Nathan Oakley

693.72 --> 696.8000000000001
to see ya

712.44 --> 717.839
right yeah one thing that really stood

714.36 --> 720.899
what Kung Fu lessons what

717.839 --> 723.0790000000001
oh kung fu for your eldest daughter all

720.899 --> 723.079
right

723.42 --> 726.26
interesting

728.339 --> 730.4590000000001
yeah

730.62 --> 733.62
306

736.92 --> 739.519
hmm

742.019 --> 745.44
all right but anyway one thing that

743.639 --> 748.98
really stood out to me

745.44 --> 752.519
and I've been noticing that more is that

748.98 --> 755.5790000000001
a lot of trolls that like put in a lot

752.519 --> 758.339
of effort to basically try to make us

755.579 --> 763.26
God no good servant

758.339 --> 767.24
what oh gun fool

763.26 --> 767.24
I don't think that's legal in Europe

776.519 --> 780.62
what oh Kieran

783.0 --> 787.16
I don't know what that is uh

787.2 --> 791.1
all right one thing that really stood

788.94 --> 793.5
out to me is that a lot of the baller

791.1 --> 795.899
trolls pursue presumed to be ballers

793.5 --> 798.54
they might just be pathetic trolls

795.899 --> 801.48
that even though they

798.54 --> 802.74
like put a lot of time into their

801.48 --> 806.1
trolling

802.74 --> 809.3
they know very very little about the

806.1 --> 809.3000000000001
people that they engage

811.5 --> 816.54
because yesterday I basically kind of

813.66 --> 819.3
went into a bit of a entire home of yeah

816.54 --> 822.18
homophobic rant you could say and even

819.3 --> 825.3
just said it like yeah

822.18 --> 826.7399999999999
I explained exactly like homophobia on

825.3 --> 828.66
my part

826.74 --> 830.82
and they didn't know

828.66 --> 832.92
even though I've been quite open about

830.82 --> 835.019
that for a while right doesn't mean that

832.92 --> 836.3389999999999
anybody in here that happens to be gay

835.019 --> 839.279
that they're not allowed or anything

836.339 --> 841.9200000000001
it's just I don't like the behavior so

839.279 --> 844.8
my policies keep it to yourself

841.92 --> 848.399
but they were just surprised and like oh

844.8 --> 850.079
oh I'm going to do something oh I we did

848.399 --> 854.339
just discovered that our witness

850.079 --> 856.8599999999999
homophobic oh my God like wow you know

854.339 --> 859.74
so little

856.86 --> 862.92
you like these people that

859.74 --> 865.4590000000001
try to troll us they they're lazy as

862.92 --> 869.2199999999999
[Â __Â ] and they improvise and they Bluff

865.459 --> 873.8599999999999
and they size up poorly based on their

869.22 --> 873.86
limited range of insight on other people

874.5 --> 879.959
right and a lot of the trolls

878.279 --> 883.92
well

879.959 --> 887.2199999999999
they show like that you see it just by

883.92 --> 889.26
them making super dumb superficial

887.22 --> 893.0400000000001
remarks and all that

889.26 --> 895.4399999999999
other people put in more effort yet with

893.04 --> 898.4399999999999
them they're not informed either there's

895.44 --> 901.2600000000001
just no really informed trolls

898.44 --> 903.36
and in a way I've been thinking about it

901.26 --> 905.3389999999999
does make sense

903.36 --> 907.26
because if you're really gonna be

905.339 --> 909.24
informed you it's very unlikely you're

907.26 --> 913.56
going to be trolling

909.24 --> 917.779
because trolling is kind of like a

913.56 --> 917.779
a childish attitude

918.12 --> 925.82
and if you know more then if you're yeah

923.1 --> 925.82
trolling

925.86 --> 933.62
doesn't is not as the more you know the

929.94 --> 933.62
less trolling becomes rewarding

935.94 --> 940.86
so this is a pattern

938.279 --> 942.779
like ignorance

940.86 --> 945.1800000000001
there's a direct correlation between

942.779 --> 948.54
ignorance and trolling

945.18 --> 950.399
people that are the most ignorant the

948.54 --> 953.04
most uninformed

950.399 --> 955.44
have a much greater likelihood of

953.04 --> 958.68
engaging in trolling of some kind

955.44 --> 962.0400000000001
so I've just spotted this correlation

958.68 --> 966.0
really informed people don't troll they

962.04 --> 968.66
engage they may cry they may test they

966.0 --> 968.66
don't troll

968.699 --> 972.24
so what do you think of that people and

971.22 --> 974.339
Nathan

972.24 --> 976.519
I'd like to hear your opinion on that as

974.339 --> 976.519
well

976.86 --> 979.399
uh

981.959 --> 987.2589999999999
nice that only 70 wearing a mask outside

1018.259 --> 1026.02
right so are you edu are you training

1021.8 --> 1026.02
Eleanor to become a Shaolin monk

1029.48 --> 1033.16
that would be pretty badass

1043.699 --> 1049.94
dude Nathan TMI

1047.059 --> 1051.98
too much information dude

1049.94 --> 1054.02
and but yeah thank you by the way good

1051.98 --> 1056.299
servant for the 99 cent Super Chat

1054.02 --> 1057.9189999999999
donation

1056.299 --> 1060.62
yeah

1057.919 --> 1063.6200000000001
right yeah look I never wear a mask

1060.62 --> 1066.1599999999999
either except except when I go into the

1063.62 --> 1066.1599999999999
coffee shop

1066.44 --> 1071.419
like I haven't even really tested

1068.539 --> 1073.78
bringing out the card medical exemption

1071.419 --> 1073.7800000000002
card

1074.9 --> 1079.1000000000001
because

1076.52 --> 1081.559
I don't know maybe I should have it's

1079.1 --> 1084.34
just like I don't really

1081.559 --> 1084.34
it's quick

1085.82 --> 1088.96
I don't really wanna

1089.12 --> 1094.34
like get

1092.059 --> 1096.3799999999999
too involved with that

1094.34 --> 1098.24
but other than that yeah Supermarket

1096.38 --> 1101.5
don't wear it outside never wear it

1098.24 --> 1101.5
pretty much never wear it

1101.78 --> 1109.6399999999999
maybe when I go and recycle

1105.38 --> 1110.96
or recycle like uh Exchange

1109.64 --> 1113.179
the

1110.96 --> 1115.82
my beer bottles

1113.179 --> 1117.679
in another Supermarket as where I buy my

1115.82 --> 1118.6399999999999
food you kind of have to wear a mask

1117.679 --> 1120.679
there

1118.64 --> 1124.8200000000002
that's where I put one on I should

1120.679 --> 1128.799
really try to use that card sometime

1124.82 --> 1128.799
there it should work

1129.44 --> 1134.539
I don't know sometimes it's just

1132.08 --> 1137.24
that if you bring out the card it kind

1134.539 --> 1139.22
of brings out more confrontation

1137.24 --> 1140.9
likelihood

1139.22 --> 1143.72
and

1140.9 --> 1146.66
often I just want to get quick and quick

1143.72 --> 1148.94
out and don't really have my mind

1146.66 --> 1151.52
focused on there because I'm still

1148.94 --> 1154.72
focusing on other things in my head

1151.52 --> 1154.72
and then I just

1155.419 --> 1161.2
quickly put on a mask and take it off as

1158.48 --> 1161.2
soon as possible

1162.62 --> 1167.78
hello Aaron Armstrong oh yeah thank you

1164.78 --> 1169.16
Gabrielle Donato for the

1167.78 --> 1172.8999999999999
five

1169.16 --> 1172.9
R dollars what

1173.6 --> 1178.6399999999999
supercheather Nation

1175.4 --> 1180.799
whatever that is our dollars what is

1178.64 --> 1183.22
that

1180.799 --> 1183.22
hmm

1187.039 --> 1190.039
foreign

1194.52 --> 1198.799
[Music]

1195.98 --> 1200.179
it's like the Brazilian currency I take

1198.799 --> 1202.4
it

1200.179 --> 1205.88
I don't know how much is it worth

1202.4 --> 1208.22
but anyway thank you for the Super Chat

1205.88 --> 1211.4
right if you really want to help me out

1208.22 --> 1213.679
by the way then please consider using

1211.4 --> 1215.0590000000002
PayPal instead because

1213.679 --> 1218.6200000000001
yeah

1215.059 --> 1221.8999999999999
as a shout out a Super Chat can be nice

1218.62 --> 1224.5
but I don't really receive

1221.9 --> 1227.299
I barely receive anything of it

1224.5 --> 1229.48
effectively effectively like the three

1227.299 --> 1229.48
percent

1229.52 --> 1235.179
about one another okay

1232.34 --> 1235.1789999999999
thank you for that

1236.12 --> 1238.6
hmm

1238.68 --> 1241.769
[Music]

1245.95 --> 1249.249
[Music]

1253.22 --> 1259.0
[Music]

1255.32 --> 1259.0
hey thank you Nathan

1260.9 --> 1266.919
for the 79 Pence

1263.84 --> 1266.9189999999999
Super Chat donation

1270.38 --> 1276.5200000000002
in point one four one Dutch currency you

1273.799 --> 1276.52
get okay

1286.7 --> 1292.28
right so yeah I heard indeed the uh

1290.0 --> 1295.82
there's Wallace in chat

1292.28 --> 1299.299
like very desperate

1295.82 --> 1300.6789999999999
right they've been praying to Satan for

1299.299 --> 1303.08
like forever

1300.679 --> 1306.0800000000002
for all the flat earthers to just

1303.08 --> 1308.48
convert back to the ball to give up

1306.08 --> 1309.74
to give up on Shining that light on the

1308.48 --> 1313.82
lies

1309.74 --> 1315.32
so now that apparently Randy is back on

1313.82 --> 1318.32
the ball

1315.32 --> 1321.3799999999999
well I don't know where ranty is on

1318.32 --> 1324.26
because he is just the person that I I

1321.38 --> 1329.3200000000002
absolutely don't trust

1324.26 --> 1329.32
and yeah that I made that quite obvious

1331.76 --> 1337.84
ranty just went where the money is he is

1334.88 --> 1337.8400000000001
broke could be

1338.179 --> 1341.5590000000002
I wouldn't be surprised

1342.2 --> 1348.26
or maybe he just wants more and he

1345.08 --> 1351.28
doesn't give a [Â __Â ] because he smashed

1348.26 --> 1351.28
his moral compass

1356.48 --> 1361.24
smash the Super Chat to keep Arwin off

1358.88 --> 1361.24
the ball

1361.34 --> 1366.02
well I'm in a Quantum flux state where I

1364.76 --> 1370.24
am on the ball

1366.02 --> 1370.24
and not on the ball at the same time

1371.12 --> 1377.08
but if you really want to help me out

1373.1 --> 1377.08
then then donate to the PayPal

1377.419 --> 1381.74
right

1379.1 --> 1385.1589999999999
because yeah only

1381.74 --> 1387.14
I upped a price right 66 million euros

1385.159 --> 1391.0
is going to make me

1387.14 --> 1391.0
really go back to the ball so

1406.52 --> 1409.0
all right

1420.02 --> 1423.52
okay Nathan

1426.559 --> 1431.4189999999999
five years to get to this point it's

1429.2 --> 1435.98
going to take more than just trolling to

1431.419 --> 1435.98
get me back to the ball right

1456.679 --> 1463.1200000000001
I would have sent you a book today I'm

1458.9 --> 1463.1200000000001
on my phone okay that that's fine Nathan

1465.14 --> 1470.24
you can send me a PayPal when you get

1468.02 --> 1473.02
back home

1470.24 --> 1473.02
that's okay

1474.02 --> 1480.86
how about some scientific evidence nah

1478.46 --> 1483.44
for the ball that's funny

1480.86 --> 1486.3799999999999
they don't even know what it is anymore

1483.44 --> 1488.059
because they choose not to know

1486.38 --> 1490.22
because they hurt

1488.059 --> 1491.1789999999999
at some point that science doesn't prove

1490.22 --> 1493.4
anything

1491.179 --> 1495.14
so they just don't care anymore and

1493.4 --> 1498.98
they'll take any

1495.14 --> 1502.3600000000001
just so story as scientific evidence

1498.98 --> 1502.3600000000001
that's the whole problem

1554.72 --> 1557.26
hmm

1561.08 --> 1565.3999999999999
all right almost forgot to make that

1562.88 --> 1567.44
note I also watched Dell went live again

1565.4 --> 1569.98
Dell's going live for a couple of times

1567.44 --> 1569.98
these days

1570.98 --> 1574.96
it's kind of amusing this chat

1577.58 --> 1584.02
didn't pay too close attention though

1581.419 --> 1584.0200000000002
hmm

1590.48 --> 1594.76
he's playing it all away with gravity

1604.039 --> 1606.64
all right

1607.82 --> 1614.539
well Ralph Rodriguez with me

1612.08 --> 1616.46
I've always kind of compartmentalized

1614.539 --> 1618.86
Flat Earth

1616.46 --> 1621.6200000000001
with the

1618.86 --> 1623.6
ball cosmology

1621.62 --> 1626.779
so even if somebody would tell me about

1623.6 --> 1628.9399999999998
it I would just try to get another

1626.779 --> 1631.58
vantage point

1628.94 --> 1634.22
of inside

1631.58 --> 1635.539
and then basically take the data for

1634.22 --> 1638.539
what it is

1635.539 --> 1641.24
separated it's like okay I have things

1638.539 --> 1644.0
about my view on the ball that are not

1641.24 --> 1645.86
resolved and I'm learning other things

1644.0 --> 1647.96
from somebody else

1645.86 --> 1649.8799999999999
they and I'm basically presuming okay

1647.96 --> 1652.82
they might be right

1649.88 --> 1655.5800000000002
they might be wrong so I'm just going to

1652.82 --> 1659.96
understand their arguments and then over

1655.58 --> 1663.86
the course of time I will learn

1659.96 --> 1666.2
maybe both are wrong and you like

1663.86 --> 1669.08
because for me it was always a like a

1666.2 --> 1671.8400000000001
tactical decision if you know

1669.08 --> 1674.36
both sides of an argument

1671.84 --> 1677.6589999999999
then it's much more likely you'll find

1674.36 --> 1680.4189999999999
that way through that people that stick

1677.659 --> 1684.14
to one side of the argument don't tend

1680.419 --> 1686.419
to see because of the polarized nature

1684.14 --> 1687.44
of their perception

1686.419 --> 1690.76
right

1687.44 --> 1692.8400000000001
so I kind of like

1690.76 --> 1694.94
compartmentalized it but there's all

1692.84 --> 1697.1
almost nobody

1694.94 --> 1699.22
that would really confront me with flat

1697.1 --> 1699.2199999999998
Earth

1699.32 --> 1707.0
like that it has happened but the ones

1703.58 --> 1709.46
that did did not like talking about it

1707.0 --> 1712.7
probably because they were still getting

1709.46 --> 1714.679
swarmed by psychological attacks from

1712.7 --> 1716.779
Ballers as soon as they would

1714.679 --> 1718.64
so they would not want to talk about it

1716.779 --> 1720.679
literally they would not want to argue

1718.64 --> 1724.8400000000001
they were not physicists

1720.679 --> 1724.8400000000001
those people that confronted me with it

1730.76 --> 1738.02
and overall they would typically Stick

1733.7 --> 1740.6000000000001
Resort to other fields

1738.02 --> 1742.94
they would rather focus on who is

1740.6 --> 1744.08
sharing this baller lie where does it

1742.94 --> 1746.059
come from

1744.08 --> 1748.279
like that was the first part I got

1746.059 --> 1752.0
confronted with it was very scary to me

1748.279 --> 1753.5
to basically realize wow there's a group

1752.0 --> 1755.6
of people out there

1753.5 --> 1758.299
that have turned everything inside out

1755.6 --> 1759.9189999999999
and they they reach all the way to the

1758.299 --> 1762.26
top

1759.919 --> 1764.7990000000002
and they've been there for like a long

1762.26 --> 1764.799
long time

1765.74 --> 1770.08
keeping everybody in that reversed world

1770.72 --> 1776.539
I learned about that before I even

1773.96 --> 1777.8600000000001
learned about the the cosmoginy

1776.539 --> 1782.12
mechanics

1777.86 --> 1784.76
because most of that part I have grass

1782.12 --> 1787.58
well ground up built

1784.76 --> 1788.899
in the whole in the whole opening up the

1787.58 --> 1791.36
Flat Earth

1788.899 --> 1794.6
getting just a couple of hints from Mark

1791.36 --> 1796.399
sergeant in 2015 from his videos and

1794.6 --> 1799.76
then just like

1796.399 --> 1803.7199999999998
like just getting a new

1799.76 --> 1805.94
big Lego set started building it from my

1803.72 --> 1808.6000000000001
own understanding

1805.94 --> 1810.76
and yeah

1808.6 --> 1814.2199999999998
cross-referencing with other people

1810.76 --> 1816.32
rolling into Flat Earth debaters

1814.22 --> 1820.539
right that's that kind of started up but

1816.32 --> 1823.1
before that I was still just Skype a lot

1820.539 --> 1824.299
conferencing with other Flat Earth

1823.1 --> 1827.36
distracted

1824.299 --> 1829.34
test the opinion where people at what do

1827.36 --> 1832.7199999999998
they typically like to talk about

1829.34 --> 1832.72
if they're flat earthers

1833.72 --> 1838.659
and doing my own shows with the Flat

1836.059 --> 1838.6589999999999
Earth talks

1843.38 --> 1847.5800000000002
but originally it started out the

1845.72 --> 1849.02
confrontations with flat Earth with the

1847.58 --> 1851.299
pure

1849.02 --> 1854.32
split world

1851.299 --> 1856.399
ground up built

1854.32 --> 1858.6789999999999
compartmentalized view on the on the

1856.399 --> 1861.1999999999998
realm it's like okay

1858.679 --> 1864.14
this is the Vantage Point assuming it's

1861.2 --> 1866.48
flat and the potent yeah the necessary

1864.14 --> 1868.94
side effects and realizations that come

1866.48 --> 1872.0
on top of it and a lot is not known yet

1868.94 --> 1876.3400000000001
and then there is the ball

1872.0 --> 1876.34
what is said about it

1877.88 --> 1883.519
and

1879.679 --> 1886.159
what are the problems with this also

1883.519 --> 1887.779
even before I really understood more

1886.159 --> 1889.22
about Flat Earth knowing like yeah

1887.779 --> 1890.899
there's probably things they're lying

1889.22 --> 1894.799
about

1890.899 --> 1898.58
to I Don't Know cover up something else

1894.799 --> 1900.08
right I was already like into X-Files in

1898.58 --> 1902.48
the 90s

1900.08 --> 1904.519
that definitely kind of suggested it

1902.48 --> 1906.6200000000001
like oh they're hiding things

1904.519 --> 1908.659
and I felt like yeah that that makes

1906.62 --> 1913.279
absolutely perfect sense even though

1908.659 --> 1916.1200000000001
they tried to it try to kind of make it

1913.279 --> 1916.12
poopoo it

1924.74 --> 1929.419
and yeah both I still have have it

1927.86 --> 1931.519
compartmentalized

1929.419 --> 1934.96
still do

1931.519 --> 1938.36
like I just have these two rooms

1934.96 --> 1941.96
cosmoginy and I can approach for both

1938.36 --> 1944.539
that's also why I can ambulate a baller

1941.96 --> 1948.019
so effectively because it is really me

1944.539 --> 1950.6
that's me from the past

1948.019 --> 1954.679
basically ignoring

1950.6 --> 1958.6999999999998
what I know about the Flat Earth

1954.679 --> 1960.679
right because I ignore that it's like an

1958.7 --> 1963.679
honest

1960.679 --> 1963.679
approach

1965.6 --> 1969.5
it's

1967.279 --> 1973.64
it's almost like controlled ignorance

1969.5 --> 1976.7
like I I can act like that and it

1973.64 --> 1978.74
becomes quite real and the the faculties

1976.7 --> 1981.76
I have the skills that I have the

1978.74 --> 1984.799
Curiosity that I have naturally unfold

1981.76 --> 1987.559
unbothered by that which I know which I

1984.799 --> 1990.86
in that moment concealed to myself

1987.559 --> 1992.059
and that's how I effectively act as a

1990.86 --> 1994.519
baller

1992.059 --> 1997.12
when I choose to

1994.519 --> 2001.2
like on the Flat Earth debates

1997.12 --> 2001.1999999999998
they're getting Nathan's hair

2001.899 --> 2005.58
right ball win

2024.58 --> 2029.86
so research concave Earth already why

2027.7 --> 2033.22
why wouldn't what's the research about

2029.86 --> 2036.12
it serious Paul Kieran what is to

2033.22 --> 2036.1200000000001
research about it

2042.519 --> 2050.159
where's the testing

2045.58 --> 2054.04
what it Where have the concavors engaged

2050.159 --> 2055.839
in testing in order to

2054.04 --> 2057.399
measure

2055.839 --> 2060.159
calculate

2057.399 --> 2062.7999999999997
how their model conception of Earth

2060.159 --> 2065.94
Works where's all the testing where's

2062.8 --> 2065.94
all the the physics

2066.399 --> 2071.02
the physics understanding where's the

2068.8 --> 2073.599
conception of the heavens all of that

2071.02 --> 2078.04
where is it

2073.599 --> 2080.139
there isn't any because it's stupid and

2078.04 --> 2084.839
you find out really quickly through

2080.139 --> 2084.839
Optics that is absolutely not concave

2086.139 --> 2094.5
hey James Mason and Amanda Jung

2090.099 --> 2094.5
and see indo-indo t

2097.78 --> 2102.82
it's open yeah well a good servant it's

2100.96 --> 2105.46
been a long time I don't know what's

2102.82 --> 2106.7200000000003
where he is

2105.46 --> 2111.06
[Music]

2106.72 --> 2111.06
I don't know could be something happen

2114.7 --> 2119.4399999999996
or maybe Obama went through like a life

2117.339 --> 2121.66
transformation and suddenly like their

2119.44 --> 2124.66
entire life setup changed maybe they met

2121.66 --> 2127.48
he met the love of his life or something

2124.66 --> 2129.64
and moved and then just completely

2127.48 --> 2131.02
stepped away from it

2129.64 --> 2134.14
so

2131.02 --> 2136.48
that could be the case

2134.14 --> 2139.14
like a clean break that's kind of been

2136.48 --> 2139.14
in the weight

2143.38 --> 2146.339
you never know

2163.06 --> 2168.54
so yeah Paul Kieran I asked you a

2166.3 --> 2168.54
question

2171.94 --> 2175.38
where's the research

2175.42 --> 2180.099
is there any actual serious

2177.579 --> 2185.28
physics-based research

2180.099 --> 2185.28
for the concave model where is it

2186.76 --> 2195.099
or do you admit it's just a cult

2191.38 --> 2197.82
because to me that's what it seems like

2195.099 --> 2197.82
for a while

2199.9 --> 2204.82
you know when there's no actual research

2201.82 --> 2207.54
being done no field testing nothing only

2204.82 --> 2207.54
just talk

2208.8 --> 2215.099
and maybe visuals and story writing

2229.42 --> 2235.0
right

2231.4 --> 2237.1600000000003
okay I have a bit of like uh I'm not and

2235.0 --> 2238.96
I just got reminded about something that

2237.16 --> 2241.42
happened yesterday that did not make me

2238.96 --> 2243.339
happy at all

2241.42 --> 2245.859
so

2243.339 --> 2248.46
when I got back from groceries I bumped

2245.859 --> 2248.46
into the

2252.4 --> 2257.619
the neighbor lady the old ladies just

2255.579 --> 2260.619
like

2257.619 --> 2262.839
I think in her 90s or something

2260.619 --> 2265.119
and

2262.839 --> 2267.4
that was really shocking because she

2265.119 --> 2270.339
basically came up to me and said like oh

2267.4 --> 2273.339
oh I got the vaccine oh it's the good

2270.339 --> 2277.24
one and that was like really mortifying

2273.339 --> 2280.2999999999997
again it's like what the [Â __Â ]

2277.24 --> 2284.3799999999997
like the last time I was with her I told

2280.3 --> 2287.44
her I told her it's all lies these

2284.38 --> 2289.42
people are literally like Nazis trying

2287.44 --> 2291.76
to

2289.42 --> 2295.0
basically

2291.76 --> 2297.6400000000003
kill off the population and just inject

2295.0 --> 2299.8
them with experimental crap

2297.64 --> 2302.02
and she apparently completely forgot

2299.8 --> 2303.28
about it and told me how she just got

2302.02 --> 2306.28
the vaccine

2303.28 --> 2309.52
Pfizer no less you're gonna get the next

2306.28 --> 2311.92
one next weekend Jesus

2309.52 --> 2315.359
well I told her like don't do that

2311.92 --> 2315.359
really don't do that

2315.4 --> 2317.94
just

2318.04 --> 2323.14
you got through the first one okay don't

2321.52 --> 2325.599
do it again

2323.14 --> 2327.5789999999997
I like you I like to keep you around

2325.599 --> 2329.7400000000002
here you're a good person with good

2327.579 --> 2331.119
spirit don't do it again

2329.74 --> 2332.2599999999998
because it's probably gonna get you

2331.119 --> 2335.1400000000003
killed

2332.26 --> 2336.82
and yeah apparently her daughter and

2335.14 --> 2339.16
everything was gonna get it too and

2336.82 --> 2342.88
she's like what the [Â __Â ]

2339.16 --> 2344.92
people good people are just being

2342.88 --> 2349.3
targeted

2344.92 --> 2349.3
for for extermination

2350.38 --> 2354.1600000000003
right and they might not literally drop

2353.079 --> 2357.099
dead

2354.16 --> 2360.18
in the moment although they could the

2357.099 --> 2360.1800000000003
old lady like

2360.94 --> 2364.56
that they're not gonna take it well

2366.099 --> 2369.2400000000002
die of old age

2373.3 --> 2379.119
maybe I hope so

2376.839 --> 2381.04
but she's still pretty strong in

2379.119 --> 2382.599
everything right she doesn't have like

2381.04 --> 2384.88
teacher in health

2382.599 --> 2386.2000000000003
situation

2384.88 --> 2388.599
so

2386.2 --> 2391.54
I was just really shocked because that's

2388.599 --> 2394.6600000000003
like a person that's the person I know

2391.54 --> 2396.64
the longest in this entire building

2394.66 --> 2398.859
that I have actual conversations with

2396.64 --> 2401.5
who knows kind of my issue like I went

2398.859 --> 2406.14
to her when I was really sick

2401.5 --> 2406.14
it's just super shocking to hear this

2409.839 --> 2415.7799999999997
feels like everybody everybody out there

2412.839 --> 2418.96
is just getting murdered and and they

2415.78 --> 2421.3
just tell me like oh I'm so happy I get

2418.96 --> 2423.76
the vaccines like yes you're so happy

2421.3 --> 2426.3
you're getting indoctrinated to murder

2423.76 --> 2426.3
yourself

2427.24 --> 2435.5989999999997
why is everybody telling me this with

2429.7 --> 2435.5989999999997
such happiness it's so [Â __Â ] up

2448.42 --> 2453.46
I yeah it gives me the feeling like I'm

2451.06 --> 2455.2599999999998
going to be like one of a thousand

2453.46 --> 2457.3
people that's going to be left alive

2455.26 --> 2460.1400000000003
here in this city like are they all

2457.3 --> 2460.1400000000003
going to die

2460.9 --> 2465.099
like

2462.46 --> 2468.04
two days ago when I went out for gross I

2465.099 --> 2471.339
saw some corpse getting

2468.04 --> 2472.72
rolled out of the house

2471.339 --> 2475.74
right

2472.72 --> 2475.74
somebody died

2478.359 --> 2482.859
like I never see that and now suddenly I

2481.3 --> 2485.38
just bump into that

2482.859 --> 2488.2
I wonder like how many people are just

2485.38 --> 2489.4
dying and

2488.2 --> 2493.14
it's just

2489.4 --> 2493.14
people barely take notice

2497.859 --> 2504.9
like why aren't people

2500.98 --> 2504.9
just outraged over all this

2505.26 --> 2508.4190000000003
[Music]

2510.76 --> 2514.5600000000004
oh Jesus James Mason

2515.079 --> 2518.04
oh God

2518.56 --> 2521.88
so sorry to hear that

2549.28 --> 2551.46
foreign

2552.7 --> 2555.7
well

2555.94 --> 2560.64
with me I don't know I don't know man

2562.42 --> 2569.6800000000003
I'm kind of nervous to think like what

2565.24 --> 2573.8799999999997
my the rest of my family is doing

2569.68 --> 2576.7
like I haven't called anybody up

2573.88 --> 2579.2200000000003
for a long time to tell them like don't

2576.7 --> 2580.5989999999997
do that

2579.22 --> 2584.56
it's

2580.599 --> 2587.4
like I'm sick of it I'm sick of being

2584.56 --> 2587.4
the guy

2587.98 --> 2595.98
trying to save everybody in my family

2591.28 --> 2595.98
when I get absolute [Â __Â ] in return

2597.76 --> 2602.079
and I am kind of morally conflicted

2600.579 --> 2604.54
about it too

2602.079 --> 2607.0
because it's like they don't want to be

2604.54 --> 2609.22
saved like they really want to die or

2607.0 --> 2611.859
something a lot of people out there they

2609.22 --> 2613.839
want to die they just don't want to

2611.859 --> 2618.22
think about it they would rather be

2613.839 --> 2621.7799999999997
randomly medically executed

2618.22 --> 2624.4599999999996
than to let it sink in that this society

2621.78 --> 2627.8390000000004
that they grew up in that they trusted

2624.46 --> 2631.48
on with the media that it's absolutely

2627.839 --> 2633.52
converted to demonic State and you

2631.48 --> 2637.359
cannot trust them

2633.52 --> 2640.96
and they just want would rather die they

2637.359 --> 2643.24
would rather die than let it sink in

2640.96 --> 2646.119
it's that bad

2643.24 --> 2648.4799999999996
and I'm kind of afraid of just how met

2646.119 --> 2648.48
like

2658.18 --> 2664.72
this my my biological instincts are just

2662.14 --> 2668.6189999999997
going nuts over this while at the same

2664.72 --> 2672.04
time my spiritual side is trying to find

2668.619 --> 2674.7400000000002
some kind of resolve and

2672.04 --> 2677.98
thinking like yeah well it was meant to

2674.74 --> 2681.0989999999997
be literally like they were designated

2677.98 --> 2684.46
spiritually to die

2681.099 --> 2690.06
like that like it was a contract with

2684.46 --> 2690.06
Satan the Satan of society go with it

2690.94 --> 2695.859
because everything will be all right

2692.859 --> 2697.72
until you get executed

2695.859 --> 2700.5989999999997
without even realize you're getting

2697.72 --> 2702.7
executed was that the contract was that

2700.599 --> 2705.6400000000003
the spiritual contract that so many

2702.7 --> 2707.7999999999997
people have engaged in is that what it

2705.64 --> 2710.98
is

2707.8 --> 2713.2000000000003
just go with the society no matter what

2710.98 --> 2716.079
until you get executed without even

2713.2 --> 2718.48
realizing it is that is that why all of

2716.079 --> 2722.6400000000003
this is happening

2718.48 --> 2722.64
are they all just Spellbound

2724.66 --> 2728.5
because of the choices they made

2726.339 --> 2730.54
throughout their life

2728.5 --> 2732.88
how to regard

2730.54 --> 2736.24
the system

2732.88 --> 2739.54
right have they all forgotten the evils

2736.24 --> 2743.2
in the system it's like

2739.54 --> 2744.819
a few decades ago it was General

2743.2 --> 2747.46
Knowledge

2744.819 --> 2749.8
that there's really [Â __Â ] up people in

2747.46 --> 2755.2
governments that are trying to take

2749.8 --> 2758.98
control do damage reap money

2755.2 --> 2760.72
so slavery to their advantage

2758.98 --> 2763.06
and that they were trying to ruin

2760.72 --> 2766.0
everything a couple of decades ago that

2763.06 --> 2769.2999999999997
was universally oops that was

2766.0 --> 2771.52
universally understood

2769.3 --> 2773.38
everybody had a hint of that whether

2771.52 --> 2776.619
they wanted to deal with it or not they

2773.38 --> 2780.48
knew it and it seems like media has just

2776.619 --> 2785.02
successfully tapped into that frequency

2780.48 --> 2790.72
and then related all to nonsense

2785.02 --> 2795.819
to blame white supremacy to to blame

2790.72 --> 2798.4599999999996
all these things all these aspects of

2795.819 --> 2800.859
you being a human being

2798.46 --> 2803.319
whether they're good or not not really

2800.859 --> 2805.2999999999997
relevant but to blame that and to

2803.319 --> 2807.52
completely relay the knowledge about

2805.3 --> 2808.96
what government is

2807.52 --> 2812.68
to that

2808.96 --> 2815.02
so that people just lose their senses in

2812.68 --> 2817.359
the face of government

2815.02 --> 2820.119
is that where where we're at it's like

2817.359 --> 2822.22
they have basically successfully

2820.119 --> 2825.46
enslaved

2822.22 --> 2829.24
the vast majority of the western world

2825.46 --> 2832.2400000000002
just completely enslaved them completely

2829.24 --> 2835.24
and they don't even know it but they'll

2832.24 --> 2837.2799999999997
defend it to no end

2835.24 --> 2839.2
without knowing it

2837.28 --> 2842.8590000000004
like

2839.2 --> 2845.68
super deep engrained Stockholm syndrome

2842.859 --> 2848.7599999999998
super deep engrained

2845.68 --> 2848.7599999999998
it's that bad

2860.619 --> 2866.2000000000003
so all these people are just going on a

2863.44 --> 2869.619
standardized route

2866.2 --> 2872.3999999999996
where they may very well be marked for

2869.619 --> 2872.4
destruction

2873.4 --> 2877.119
and

2875.2 --> 2878.859
they don't want to break out of it they

2877.119 --> 2881.079
don't want to break out of it they don't

2878.859 --> 2883.859
want to start

2881.079 --> 2883.8590000000004
from scratch

2885.28 --> 2888.3590000000004
they just don't want it

2888.4 --> 2895.3
they would rather die

2892.0 --> 2898.18
so how many people are there out there

2895.3 --> 2901.6800000000003
that would rather die

2898.18 --> 2901.68
than just confront

2901.96 --> 2907.359
what's going on what they've taken for

2904.72 --> 2911.5589999999997
granted what is being taken away

2907.359 --> 2916.44
and what people would rather die

2911.559 --> 2916.44
than think that it is being taken away

2924.839 --> 2929.38
faith and R we need to push how do we

2927.28 --> 2932.559
organize the former spearhead to any no

2929.38 --> 2936.4
it doesn't matter no you can't

2932.559 --> 2938.2000000000003
you can form a whole group a Media Group

2936.4 --> 2940.059
that would give the alt it doesn't

2938.2 --> 2943.0
matter it's not gonna dissuade these

2940.059 --> 2944.98
people the only way to make it stop is

2943.0 --> 2948.52
to cut

2944.98 --> 2952.66
the spell casting off by the neck

2948.52 --> 2952.66
and that means literally

2952.839 --> 2957.64
like make heads roll

2955.119 --> 2959.7400000000002
at who's organizing this [Â __Â ] who's

2957.64 --> 2961.54
organizing this plan like literally

2959.74 --> 2965.02
executing them

2961.54 --> 2967.72
and make it known make it known like we

2965.02 --> 2970.3
have just executed the spellcasters that

2967.72 --> 2973.0789999999997
were setting you on a course for

2970.3 --> 2973.079
extermination

2973.48 --> 2978.22
because you can form all the alternative

2976.24 --> 2980.68
media and all that

2978.22 --> 2984.4599999999996
even become quite big

2980.68 --> 2986.5589999999997
it's not gonna make these people stuff

2984.46 --> 2990.04
they're not going to stop doing it until

2986.559 --> 2991.7200000000003
the snake that is casting the spell is

2990.04 --> 2996.16
caught off by the head

2991.72 --> 2997.1189999999997
cut off not silence not muzzle not cut

2996.16 --> 3000.48
off

2997.119 --> 3002.46
like permanently eviscerated

3000.48 --> 3005.819
that's the only thing that's going to

3002.46 --> 3009.119
actually break that spell

3005.819 --> 3012.42
only by death will it break it

3009.119 --> 3015.2400000000002
the death of the spellcasters

3012.42 --> 3017.16
the death of the snake the head of the

3015.24 --> 3017.9399999999996
snake it's the only one that's gonna do

3017.16 --> 3020.3999999999996
it

3017.94 --> 3022.46
and that's why I've been

3020.4 --> 3026.76
shouting pretty extreme things

3022.46 --> 3029.04
concerning that in the last few weeks

3026.76 --> 3031.8
because that is my conclusion there is

3029.04 --> 3035.339
just no other option there really isn't

3031.8 --> 3038.0
now if you think there is I'd like to

3035.339 --> 3040.5589999999997
hear about it anywhere

3038.0 --> 3043.98
anywhere I'd like to hear about it

3040.559 --> 3047.059
anywhere out there that would be great I

3043.98 --> 3047.059
don't see any other way

3048.54 --> 3055.099
there is a sorcerer an evil evil

3052.079 --> 3057.42
[Â __Â ] sorcerer metaphorically

3055.099 --> 3061.26
revealed themselves they completely

3057.42 --> 3063.54
unclogged their spell casting there it

3061.26 --> 3065.2200000000003
is going to kill everybody

3063.54 --> 3067.74
you can't

3065.22 --> 3070.74
just talk

3067.74 --> 3073.6189999999997
blah blah blah this is wrong that no you

3070.74 --> 3076.7999999999997
have to kill him you have to kill the

3073.619 --> 3080.94
sorcery have to stop it

3076.8 --> 3083.6400000000003
so that it cannot be continued the spell

3080.94 --> 3086.64
casting has to be permanently stopped

3083.64 --> 3091.2
and the only way to permanently stop it

3086.64 --> 3092.7599999999998
is by cutting the head of the snake off

3091.2 --> 3095.64
that's the only way it's going to stop

3092.76 --> 3099.48
otherwise if you just take the tentacles

3095.64 --> 3101.94
the corporates that are just rolling out

3099.48 --> 3104.339
the narrative as long as the narrative

3101.94 --> 3108.9
keeps getting written for them

3104.339 --> 3113.52
as long as the the party Direction

3108.9 --> 3115.859
is being printed out for them written

3113.52 --> 3117.839
if you take out the tentacles somebody

3115.859 --> 3120.7799999999997
else is just gonna step in and take over

3117.839 --> 3123.18
just like nothing happened

3120.78 --> 3127.28
the only way to stop it is by cutting

3123.18 --> 3127.2799999999997
the snake head off

3129.39 --> 3132.48
[Music]

3138.78 --> 3144.96
or letting this all continue roll out

3141.96 --> 3147.54
until everybody's dead and then guess

3144.96 --> 3151.38
what the survivors that didn't die

3147.54 --> 3154.319
they will be in denial forever forever

3151.38 --> 3157.98
you will never get them on your side

3154.319 --> 3161.819
because you let it happen

3157.98 --> 3165.66
you let this snake cast his spell until

3161.819 --> 3168.2599999999998
the end and now everybody's dead and the

3165.66 --> 3168.2599999999998
survivors

3170.04 --> 3176.339
they will never side with you

3174.359 --> 3179.88
do you understand

3176.339 --> 3184.94
they will never side with you

3179.88 --> 3184.94
unless we cut the snake's head off

3185.42 --> 3188.539
[Music]

3236.46 --> 3241.8
vaccines are a part of the horror Oh Oh

3239.28 --> 3244.079
you mean how the vaccines

3241.8 --> 3246.6800000000003
have been produced

3244.079 --> 3248.579
yeah produced

3246.68 --> 3250.68
produced

3248.579 --> 3252.1800000000003
ready to go

3250.68 --> 3255.5989999999997
before

3252.18 --> 3258.8999999999996
the covid outbreak was even discovered

3255.599 --> 3262.6800000000003
you mean that part you mean that

3258.9 --> 3265.8
yeah yeah we know we know the vaccines

3262.68 --> 3267.3799999999997
who are ready to go they were already

3265.8 --> 3271.4
patented

3267.38 --> 3275.099
produced before the outbreak even came

3271.4 --> 3277.02
oh that's that's the logical order of

3275.099 --> 3280.02
how vaccines are produced aren't they

3277.02 --> 3284.66
yeah yeah yeah oh you always make

3280.02 --> 3288.24
vaccines to cure a disease of some kind

3284.66 --> 3291.54
ahead before you know it will come into

3288.24 --> 3295.0789999999997
existence that's how it works right yeah

3291.54 --> 3297.299
no no

3295.079 --> 3300.98
that's not how it works

3297.299 --> 3304.44
that's not how vaccination works

3300.98 --> 3306.96
absolutely preposterous

3304.44 --> 3310.02
do you have proof of that yeah why don't

3306.96 --> 3313.079
you go look into the official literature

3310.02 --> 3317.9
of the vaccine Productions and see when

3313.079 --> 3317.9
it was first patented Chantry wood

3325.9 --> 3330.2400000000002
[Music]

3328.319 --> 3332.46
oh and by the way

3330.24 --> 3335.22
they're not vaccines

3332.46 --> 3338.64
right so yeah that's already a good

3335.22 --> 3340.98
answer as to why it was already better

3338.64 --> 3343.74
than and produced before it even

3340.98 --> 3345.66
happened because it's not a vaccine it

3343.74 --> 3349.3799999999997
has nothing to do

3345.66 --> 3353.3999999999996
with the medical condition

3349.38 --> 3356.28
having the flu or a cold with an

3353.4 --> 3358.92
abundance of exosomes in your system as

3356.28 --> 3361.26
a defense response

3358.92 --> 3363.9
so no proof yeah I gave you the proof

3361.26 --> 3370.88
look at when

3363.9 --> 3374.64
the patent was filed for the vaccine

3370.88 --> 3377.339
covet vaccine look it up

3374.64 --> 3380.1189999999997
it's registered

3377.339 --> 3380.119
ass

3383.76 --> 3387.7200000000003
oh do I have to be a doctor or a

3386.22 --> 3392.2799999999997
scientist

3387.72 --> 3398.0989999999997
to know that the covet vaccines were

3392.28 --> 3398.099
patented and produced partially before

3398.72 --> 3405.0
before

3400.7 --> 3406.9199999999996
covet outbreak was discovered yeah I

3405.0 --> 3409.079
have to be a doctor or scientist to know

3406.92 --> 3412.079
that of something that is officially

3409.079 --> 3412.079
registered

3415.44 --> 3420.2400000000002
and what did is that it's before covet

3418.74 --> 3421.5589999999997
outbreak

3420.24 --> 3426.68
you understand

3421.559 --> 3426.6800000000003
it was actually the summer before that

3428.22 --> 3436.5589999999997
how do I know this because I heard it

3431.76 --> 3438.3190000000004
people don't lie about that

3436.559 --> 3442.6400000000003
that would be

3438.319 --> 3442.64
bad for their reputation

3444.78 --> 3450.9
I don't know the actual date

3448.5 --> 3452.64

yeah because that's what hurts that's

3784.319 --> 3789.42
the thing that hurts

3786.66 --> 3792.18
when you let the fog lift that's the

3789.42 --> 3794.16
thing that hurts the truth the real

3792.18 --> 3798.9199999999996

right get enough of these people

3838.079 --> 3843.059
together

3839.819 --> 3845.819
start getting blatant and honest start

3843.059 --> 3849.059
basically militarizing

3845.819 --> 3852.119
yeah I said it militarizing

3849.059 --> 3854.42
just taking a stance like no [Â __Â ] you

3852.119 --> 3854.42
government

3854.579 --> 3859.7400000000002
[Â __Â ] you

3856.44 --> 3862.619
we're not complying you send in the

3859.74 --> 3865.0789999999997
[Â __Â ] Army it's gonna be War yeah

3862.619 --> 3867.6600000000003
they're not even supposed to do that

3865.079 --> 3870.3590000000004
but yeah if that's how it's gonna be

3867.66 --> 3873.8999999999996
then it's going to be just that

3870.359 --> 3876.96
because the snake is getting really big

3873.9 --> 3879.42
really fat

3876.96 --> 3883.92
you can't wait anymore

3879.42 --> 3889.02
you're going to die anyway do you

3883.92 --> 3891.839
understand there is no survival in this

3889.02 --> 3893.22
survival should be off the list of

3891.839 --> 3895.74
priorities

3893.22 --> 3898.98
only priority now

3895.74 --> 3900.18
is that you confront yourself with

3898.98 --> 3903.96
reality

3900.18 --> 3907.44
it's very [Â __Â ] painful

3903.96 --> 3910.859
stop deluding yourself break out of

3907.44 --> 3913.2000000000003
Satan's spells the spell of lies lies

3910.859 --> 3915.299
the lies is the thing that's creating

3913.2 --> 3916.98
the fog for you to think that you can

3915.299 --> 3920.88
just carry on everything will be all

3916.98 --> 3922.02
right no it won't let the fog lift take

3920.88 --> 3925.5
the pain

3922.02 --> 3930.299
and do what is necessary get the

3925.5 --> 3933.359
momentum get the people and take it down

3930.299 --> 3936.599
the media

3933.359 --> 3941.42
the government sickos

3936.599 --> 3941.42
know your targets get organized

3941.7 --> 3946.339
take them out

3943.38 --> 3946.339
let it happen

3947.339 --> 3950.599
there's no other way

3955.44 --> 3959.579
right

3956.88 --> 3962.2200000000003
and all these freaks out there that just

3959.579 --> 3963.7200000000003
puppets that are just like zombies

3962.22 --> 3965.2799999999997
getting stared around to create

3963.72 --> 3967.4399999999996
destruction

3965.28 --> 3970.02
like they're not a real threat right

3967.44 --> 3972.359
they're only a threat to those still

3970.02 --> 3974.94
stuck in the spell if you're Spellbound

3972.359 --> 3977.2799999999997
if you're a weak and Spellbound in a fog

3974.94 --> 3978.839
yeah they will come after you they will

3977.28 --> 3983.2200000000003
eat you alive

3978.839 --> 3986.52
right if your fog is lifted

3983.22 --> 3987.48
they're not a threat you will see them

3986.52 --> 3990.359
coming

3987.48 --> 3993.48
at a vast distance they will fear you

3990.359 --> 3996.48
because you don't fear them

3993.48 --> 3999.68
if you let the fog lift if you confront

3996.48 --> 3999.68
yourself with reality

3999.72 --> 4002.74
make it happen

4005.059 --> 4008.8390000000004
there's millions of people in the United

4007.28 --> 4011.7200000000003
States

4008.839 --> 4016.2799999999997
there's even more guns

4011.72 --> 4020.4199999999996
think there's at least as many and just

4016.28 --> 4024.619
you have overwhelming potential if you

4020.42 --> 4027.799
only let the fog of Lies lift from you

4024.619 --> 4029.38
take the pain and do as your

4027.799 --> 4032.74
Constitution

4029.38 --> 4034.339
demands from you

4032.74 --> 4037.64
demands

4034.339 --> 4039.2599999999998
and when you don't then it's just toilet

4037.64 --> 4041.859
paper to you

4039.26 --> 4041.8590000000004
you understand

4061.64 --> 4067.64
yeah that's right Nathan r

4063.68 --> 4071.5589999999997
and that time is way overdue

4067.64 --> 4076.839
so unless you want to unroll into a

4071.559 --> 4076.8390000000004
full-blown Soviet United States

4076.88 --> 4081.6800000000003
full-blown Soviet and much worse than

4079.579 --> 4084.5
the Soviet Union in Russia was by the

4081.68 --> 4085.8799999999997
way it's going to be much worse

4084.5 --> 4089.0
like

4085.88 --> 4091.78
just demonic to a level that defies

4089.0 --> 4091.78
imagination

4092.48 --> 4094.96
right

4095.119 --> 4101.839
you have no choice it's over it's over

4098.54 --> 4105.679
you have to go now you have to go now

4101.839 --> 4109.88
and do this it's over

4105.679 --> 4114.14
the American dream needs to end

4109.88 --> 4117.4400000000005
an American Spirit needs to actually

4114.14 --> 4119.6
take a grip and for that the dream needs

4117.44 --> 4121.46
to end the fog needs to lift you need to

4119.6 --> 4126.620000000001
confront yourself with the pain of

4121.46 --> 4130.1
reality and do as the rules appointed by

4126.62 --> 4134.44
God the Constitution rules given to you

4130.1 --> 4136.529
by God remember as they demand from you

4134.44 --> 4137.8589999999995
God demands

4136.529 --> 4142.120000000001
[Music]

4137.859 --> 4145.759
by law you do this

4142.12 --> 4149.92
by law God's law

4145.759 --> 4149.92
that you do this do it

4177.98 --> 4182.678999999999
ah

4179.96 --> 4182.679
whoa

4182.96 --> 4188.299
man it's I've already gone for like over

4186.259 --> 4193.06
an hour

4188.299 --> 4193.06
I uh I had a message I think

4193.159 --> 4198.5599999999995
like it's to me it's like what only 10

4196.88 --> 4202.06
minutes have passed but apparently it's

4198.56 --> 4202.06
been one hour and 10 minutes

4202.699 --> 4207.62
anyway I need I'll I'll continue on the

4205.34 --> 4209.54
show maybe I'll do just another two hour

4207.62 --> 4212.0199999999995
show but I'm gonna be back in two

4209.54 --> 4212.0199999999995
minutes so

4287.659 --> 4290.659
foreign

4291.56 --> 4293.8
foreign

4306.8 --> 4309.8
Christian

4318.08 --> 4323.0599999999995
no I personally am

4320.36 --> 4324.38
I've look I've been kind of a Judean

4323.06 --> 4326.659000000001
Christian but

4324.38 --> 4328.52
think what is that even is that even a

4326.659 --> 4330.32
thing

4328.52 --> 4332.6
I don't think so it's kind of

4330.32 --> 4336.0199999999995
self-contradicting

4332.6 --> 4338.360000000001
it's like oh yeah I am in something that

4336.02 --> 4340.64
believes two completely the opposite

4338.36 --> 4341.599999999999
things but I'm going to pretend it's one

4340.64 --> 4344.780000000001
thing

4341.6 --> 4347.120000000001
right I think that islamo Christian is

4344.78 --> 4349.759999999999
much more realistic

4347.12 --> 4352.84
because in the roots they are really

4349.76 --> 4352.84
very similar

4356.96 --> 4360.699
but yeah whatever

4366.199 --> 4371.0199999999995
anyway if you liked my message

4371.719 --> 4375.94
I'd appreciate PayPal donations

4385.34 --> 4389.4400000000005
the gatekeeper what

4393.92 --> 4398.6
thank you

4396.02 --> 4400.280000000001
right cabinator that's well that's what

4398.6 --> 4404.08
I've been hearing also from Owen

4400.28 --> 4404.08
Benjamin and I kind of have to agree

4414.86 --> 4420.92
we're going to make it oh really good

4417.32 --> 4423.799999999999
service no that's after death how about

4420.92 --> 4426.56
we deal with life instead of constantly

4423.8 --> 4428.4800000000005
focusing on afterlife

4426.56 --> 4432.159000000001
why don't you do something successful

4428.48 --> 4432.159
during life and then

4432.26 --> 4438.56
and then yeah that particular discipline

4436.1 --> 4440.42
hey who knows it might help you after

4438.56 --> 4442.900000000001
death

4440.42 --> 4442.9
right

4444.92 --> 4452.679
Gideon sick hello what

4448.04 --> 4452.679
visuals are in yours what

4460.4 --> 4464.44
good morning Ragnar Stefan halderson

4490.82 --> 4494.08
it's graphics

4496.28 --> 4502.5199999999995
my head is in a huge Stout Gaston

4499.82 --> 4505.82
Gateway okay I don't know what that

4502.52 --> 4507.92
implies though but yeah sure that's

4505.82 --> 4510.88
that's this the setup for this show

4507.92 --> 4510.88
right now visually

4515.48 --> 4520.879999999999
ah seems like your R key is

4517.88 --> 4520.88
misfunctioning

4525.199 --> 4530.0599999999995
yeah yeah the graphics are great I I

4527.659 --> 4533.42
like the graphics too it's mostly thanks

4530.06 --> 4535.46
to Adam meekin for finding it somewhere

4533.42 --> 4537.679
on the internet

4535.46 --> 4540.62
and then integrating it into my show

4537.679 --> 4543.9400000000005
setup it's pretty neat isn't it

4540.62 --> 4543.94
animated background

4545.06 --> 4548.620000000001
and I got others as well

4551.12 --> 4555.58
see

4552.679 --> 4555.58
like this one

4558.08 --> 4560.62
we

4568.46 --> 4574.82
oh I'm a gatekeeper

4572.0 --> 4575.9
well sure you can call me Peter if you

4574.82 --> 4579.32
like

4575.9 --> 4581.719
although my name is technically Paul but

4579.32 --> 4584.799999999999
yeah

4581.719 --> 4584.8
right well

4584.9 --> 4588.699
if I'd be a gatekeeper

4588.98 --> 4596.299999999999
then I wouldn't hide the gate right

4591.98 --> 4598.04
because a real gatekeeper hides the game

4596.3 --> 4600.38
they hide it

4598.04 --> 4602.6
so that you don't know it's there and

4600.38 --> 4605.0
that way you keep it

4602.6 --> 4607.64
and prevent others from going through

4605.0 --> 4610.04
the game that's a gatekeeper a

4607.64 --> 4613.9400000000005
gatekeeper hides the gate

4610.04 --> 4615.8
does this gate look hidden

4613.94 --> 4618.82
right

4615.8 --> 4618.820000000001
is it hidden

4621.8 --> 4627.02
is there something particular

4625.219 --> 4630.34
Direction

4627.02 --> 4630.34
piece of information

4631.34 --> 4637.78
some things that I'm hiding

4635.12 --> 4637.78
right

4647.6 --> 4651.6990000000005
that's why it's funny yeah I agree

4664.76 --> 4669.5
no I'm not talking to you angrily or

4667.46 --> 4672.08
something I'm just

4669.5 --> 4674.42
because there are trolls out there that

4672.08 --> 4676.4
like to call me that but they literally

4674.42 --> 4678.38
don't even understand what a gatekeeper

4676.4 --> 4681.199
actually means

4678.38 --> 4684.62
they just heard it as a word like shill

4681.199 --> 4686.839999999999
most people that say she'll literally

4684.62 --> 4689.08
don't know what a shill is they don't

4686.84 --> 4689.08
know

4690.14 --> 4695.3
and neither for the gatekeeper so these

4692.54 --> 4697.94
are just a lot of blank statements

4695.3 --> 4700.78
people use and they don't even know what

4697.94 --> 4700.78
it means

4701.3 --> 4705.76
right let's get back to the nice picture

4716.96 --> 4721.659
he ill camera lingo

4729.86 --> 4733.78
in cell comment what

4734.42 --> 4736.6
foreign

4738.14 --> 4745.179
sorry but in cells and demonic is kind

4741.62 --> 4745.179
of very similar

4745.34 --> 4750.1
I don't see what incel's doing in

4747.38 --> 4750.1
between there

4756.56 --> 4762.9800000000005
but yeah that's

4759.62 --> 4765.08
Dix versus the dicks yeah that's kind of

4762.98 --> 4767.919999999999
cute I like that

4765.08 --> 4767.92
I get it

4774.74 --> 4780.5199999999995
[Music]

4783.44 --> 4786.679999999999
[Music]

4796.58 --> 4801.699
although I would I would probably put in

4799.58 --> 4804.8
more in the direction of demonic

4801.699 --> 4806.659
atheist communists

4804.8 --> 4808.820000000001
right

4806.659 --> 4811.879999999999
because and it should be in between

4808.82 --> 4814.219
there as well

4811.88 --> 4817.04
because that's really where it sprouts

4814.219 --> 4820.9
from Source communism which is like a

4817.04 --> 4824.239
moral Sprouts from and demonic Behavior

4820.9 --> 4827.179
which is what also Sprouts from atheism

4824.239 --> 4830.0
it gives you the opportunity to let it

4827.179 --> 4832.76
slide down because there is no

4830.0 --> 4834.26
importance anymore where you are morally

4832.76 --> 4838.360000000001
wise right

4834.26 --> 4841.0
so I would change that slightly so

4838.36 --> 4845.179
judeo-islamic Christians versus

4841.0 --> 4846.679
demonic atheist communists

4845.179 --> 4849.02
right

4846.679 --> 4852.38
because in cells just way too specific

4849.02 --> 4856.6
and yeah

4852.38 --> 4856.6
it kind of falls under demonics anyway

4878.96 --> 4883.2390000000005
yeah jix versus the Dax

4885.8 --> 4888.52
okay

4894.17 --> 4898.639
[Music]

4895.94 --> 4900.98
but really I think that pretty much

4898.639 --> 4903.56
every religion

4900.98 --> 4906.259999999999
like the actual people not the priests

4903.56 --> 4909.320000000001
that are often caught up into

4906.26 --> 4912.02
standardized control mechanisms but the

4909.32 --> 4916.28
actual religion followers

4912.02 --> 4919.46
it's not just Islam and Christianity

4916.28 --> 4920.84
right it should be every single one of

4919.46 --> 4923.96
them

4920.84 --> 4924.9800000000005
if they have it in them unless they are

4923.96 --> 4928.1
like

4924.98 --> 4930.739
hardcore pacifist then yet still use

4928.1 --> 4933.56
right they're always going to be neutral

4930.739 --> 4936.44
but there's a lot of religions that have

4933.56 --> 4939.139
just like a distinguishment between good

4936.44 --> 4943.638999999999
and evil and you have to

4939.139 --> 4947.3
pick a side when things heat up

4943.639 --> 4951.139
so I'm just saying

4947.3 --> 4953.42
Christian Islamic because I think that

4951.139 --> 4956.86
they're very close I think this is like

4953.42 --> 4959.96
a unique opportunity for a original

4956.86 --> 4963.92
Brotherhood within religion within the

4959.96 --> 4966.679
spiritual religions to

4963.92 --> 4970.1
kind of make up

4966.679 --> 4972.4400000000005
despite all the the beasts media

4970.1 --> 4975.08
influence and just the fear porn and

4972.44 --> 4977.96
misunderstandings

4975.08 --> 4980.179
to kind of like

4977.96 --> 4982.1
look at like yeah

4980.179 --> 4984.32
just look at each other's Roots it's

4982.1 --> 4985.9400000000005
like yeah we're almost the same yeah

4984.32 --> 4989.299999999999
that's right you're almost the same

4985.94 --> 4992.299999999999
that's why I I like to pick them

4989.3 --> 4995.659000000001
because I see it as an opportunity

4992.3 --> 4998.659000000001
for sort of a maybe temper temporary

4995.659 --> 5000.179
Alliance or a unification

4998.659 --> 5002.5
not an

5000.179 --> 5004.54
organization-wise unification right we

5002.5 --> 5006.4
don't need more centralization that's

5004.54 --> 5008.5
not what I'm talking about I'm talking

5006.4 --> 5011.92
about a spiritual

5008.5 --> 5013.84
moment where we can finally agree that

5011.92 --> 5015.58
we rest on the same things and we need

5013.84 --> 5018.76
to do something about this

5015.58 --> 5019.96
right but it should technically be all

5018.76 --> 5023.4400000000005
people

5019.96 --> 5025.86
all good people in religions

5023.44 --> 5031.178999999999
unless that religion is predefinition

5025.86 --> 5034.299999999999
pacifist hardcore then then yeah

5031.179 --> 5036.9400000000005
then they're kind of useless

5034.3 --> 5040.26
in this process they just have to try to

5036.94 --> 5040.259999999999
survive through it somehow

5042.1 --> 5046.3
yeah

5043.26 --> 5049.12
good on them

5046.3 --> 5051.52
who gives a [Â __Â ]

5049.12 --> 5053.38
right they do recognize that he's

5051.52 --> 5056.320000000001
actually a prophet

5053.38 --> 5059.8
that's good enough for me

5056.32 --> 5062.5599999999995
now if you have to abide by your

5059.8 --> 5065.320000000001
Priestly conditioning right the Beast

5062.56 --> 5066.52
priest right

5065.32 --> 5070.86
them

5066.52 --> 5070.860000000001
creating all this are we still going

5071.02 --> 5077.26
hello hello hello yes thank God

5074.679 --> 5079.6
just in time

5077.26 --> 5082.179
yeah my internet got disconnected but I

5079.6 --> 5085.139
managed to quickly resolve it before the

5082.179 --> 5085.139
show ended so

5085.239 --> 5088.839999999999
hmm

5086.56 --> 5090.159000000001
okay where did I leave off

5088.84 --> 5092.6990000000005
right

5090.159 --> 5092.699
yeah

5095.98 --> 5101.678999999999
right I think that that a lot of these

5098.92 --> 5104.02
Priestly indoctrinated Christians that

5101.679 --> 5106.36
just say no he has to be God and he's

5104.02 --> 5107.4400000000005
his own father and he's his own son and

5106.36 --> 5109.299999999999
God

5107.44 --> 5113.199
died

5109.3 --> 5116.62
and then resurrected and blah I think

5113.199 --> 5119.919999999999
that is just completely insane and

5116.62 --> 5124.12
stupid I really do and at that I

5119.92 --> 5126.58
completely back up Owen Benjamin's

5124.12 --> 5129.94
Trinity allergy because I think it's

5126.58 --> 5134.199
really [Â __Â ] stupid it's esoteric

5129.94 --> 5136.419999999999
mumbo jumbo literally esoteric in this

5134.199 --> 5139.719
case bad acetate it's not acetate it's

5136.42 --> 5142.78
esoteric sorry I completely

5139.719 --> 5145.179
okay forget the last 10 seconds it's

5142.78 --> 5147.94
exoteric mumbo-jumbo

5145.179 --> 5149.9800000000005
it's taking Concepts and then kind of

5147.94 --> 5152.699
like making a puzzle with them it makes

5149.98 --> 5155.86
no freaking sense there's no exit

5152.699 --> 5158.0199999999995
esoterics about it

5155.86 --> 5160.0599999999995
it's nonsense

5158.02 --> 5164.139
right

5160.06 --> 5166.900000000001
all that matters with Jesus Christ

5164.139 --> 5168.400000000001
is that he was the best of us that he

5166.9 --> 5171.36
was a prophet

5168.4 --> 5171.36
that he probably

5171.659 --> 5175.299999999999
revealed

5173.5 --> 5177.34
the best

5175.3 --> 5179.56
possible course

5177.34 --> 5182.7390000000005
that a human being could take with

5179.56 --> 5185.7390000000005
choices in their lives

5182.739 --> 5188.44
that the world has ever seen

5185.739 --> 5192.339999999999
right and that's all I need to know

5188.44 --> 5193.78
because I don't need him to be literal

5192.34 --> 5196.900000000001
God

5193.78 --> 5199.12
because I'm not a wanker

5196.9 --> 5203.86
that wants to exclude everything else

5199.12 --> 5206.38
and that wants to make ridiculous claims

5203.86 --> 5208.179
right it's ridiculous

5206.38 --> 5210.76
to think that

5208.179 --> 5213.76
no he was the best of us he was the

5210.76 --> 5217.12
ultimate example in a time when that was

5213.76 --> 5219.58
like unheard of right that like today if

5217.12 --> 5222.4
Christ was exactly what he was back then

5219.58 --> 5224.8
he would just be a good person in a lot

5222.4 --> 5227.199
of ways very wise very revered and

5224.8 --> 5231.42
respected and then imagine that freaking

5227.199 --> 5235.419999999999
2 000 years ago that's just amazing

5231.42 --> 5235.42
amazing right

5235.54 --> 5243.04
but it's amazing because it's amazing

5238.78 --> 5245.38
not because one in one is three and he

5243.04 --> 5248.139
is God and it is his own son and his own

5245.38 --> 5251.9800000000005
father no not because of that it's

5248.139 --> 5254.9800000000005
amazing because what he did and how we

5251.98 --> 5258.58
did it was amazing

5254.98 --> 5262.599999999999
and his vision and his fractal Insight

5258.58 --> 5265.719
was freaking amazing unheard of

5262.6 --> 5269.5
that should be good enough it should be

5265.719 --> 5272.56
good enough is an example he revealed

5269.5 --> 5273.699
that there even is such a thing as a

5272.56 --> 5277.780000000001
path

5273.699 --> 5279.879999999999
he revealed the path

5277.78 --> 5282.42
for the first time

5279.88 --> 5282.42
okay

5283.54 --> 5289.54
he is still the best of us

5286.0 --> 5292.0
he does not have to be literal God his

5289.54 --> 5295.56
own father his own son all that nonsense

5292.0 --> 5295.56
he was the best of us

5299.92 --> 5306.3
yeah now well though I don't think that

5302.26 --> 5306.3
the Bible even literally claims that

5306.52 --> 5312.88
I think that certain people might claim

5308.8 --> 5315.58
that I don't think so right but there's

5312.88 --> 5318.159000000001
other ways to interpret it too now if

5315.58 --> 5322.54
you would say that Jesus would Channel

5318.159 --> 5325.839999999999
God like the actual full-on God

5322.54 --> 5327.219
I'd be like whoa

5325.84 --> 5329.9800000000005
that's

5327.219 --> 5332.8
that's impossible right like I can't

5329.98 --> 5335.86
imagine doing that freaking channeling

5332.8 --> 5339.639
God himself completely not through

5335.86 --> 5341.679
Angels that's unbelievable like a

5339.639 --> 5343.42
human's not even supposed to be built to

5341.679 --> 5344.92
do that without just completely

5343.42 --> 5347.4400000000005
disintegrating

5344.92 --> 5349.92
in my opinion

5347.44 --> 5349.919999999999
right

5350.1 --> 5354.4800000000005
to literally be that

5354.88 --> 5360.46
to have him

5357.58 --> 5361.54
relay direct messages

5360.46 --> 5364.6
yeah

5361.54 --> 5367.0
I totally get that and at that in that

5364.6 --> 5369.88
moment in spirit

5367.0 --> 5373.179
he would be the father he would be his

5369.88 --> 5374.86
own father he would be channeling his

5373.179 --> 5379.659
own father

5374.86 --> 5383.92
but was he literally always his father

5379.659 --> 5386.92
and then he dies makes no damn sense

5383.92 --> 5386.92
whatsoever

5391.06 --> 5393.54
right

5393.76 --> 5399.159000000001
so yeah Point me at where the Bible

5396.88 --> 5402.219
literally not interpreted by somebody

5399.159 --> 5404.32
where it literally says that and I will

5402.219 --> 5406.84
scratch it out

5404.32 --> 5409.9
because it's a lie and I don't give a

5406.84 --> 5411.9400000000005
[Â __Â ] what you think about that

5409.9 --> 5413.379999999999
no matter who you are I don't give a

5411.94 --> 5415.0
[Â __Â ] what you think about that it's

5413.38 --> 5418.08
[Â __Â ]

5415.0 --> 5418.08
it's wrong

5419.08 --> 5422.86
if you're gonna take that absolutely

5421.06 --> 5424.4800000000005
literal and I don't even think that it's

5422.86 --> 5426.36
supposed to be that so I guess in

5424.48 --> 5429.218999999999
retrospect I'm not gonna scratch it out

5426.36 --> 5431.32
rather scratch out you

5429.219 --> 5434.199
because you're an idiot that is just

5431.32 --> 5437.219
blatantly interpreting it wrong

5434.199 --> 5437.219
like an idiot

5440.5 --> 5445.8
all right I'm not gonna scratch out any

5442.239 --> 5445.799999999999
part of the Bible that's ridiculous

5447.58 --> 5451.38
you just need to read it right

5453.219 --> 5456.2390000000005
get real

5468.34 --> 5474.400000000001
well George Sanford

5470.739 --> 5477.339999999999
yeah that's very interesting

5474.4 --> 5480.28
but Jesus Christ did not commit suicide

5477.34 --> 5483.34
he simply did not see A better ending

5480.28 --> 5485.44
right when you have full oversight

5483.34 --> 5486.400000000001
constantly you have to choose your own

5485.44 --> 5489.219
ending

5486.4 --> 5491.5
he knew it was gonna end he was not able

5489.219 --> 5492.52
to prevent it and still fulfill his

5491.5 --> 5493.6
mission

5492.52 --> 5496.540000000001
right

5493.6 --> 5499.42
so he chose to just let it happen like

5496.54 --> 5501.58
this and kind of use his own end

5499.42 --> 5503.639
as an influence

5501.58 --> 5508.26
right that's not committing suicide

5503.639 --> 5508.26
that's simply choosing your end

5515.679 --> 5518.159
right

5525.88 --> 5529.679
right and suicide is a sin

5529.719 --> 5533.699
absolutely Beyond sin

5549.58 --> 5555.04
do you think I'm an idiot for what good

5552.58 --> 5557.26
servant for thinking that Jesus Christ

5555.04 --> 5562.5
was literally God

5557.26 --> 5562.5
if that's what you think yes yes I do

5570.94 --> 5577.96
right God is there at all who was at the

5575.62 --> 5579.88
helm like I I don't even want to go the

5577.96 --> 5582.219
full Owen Benjamin route because I'm

5579.88 --> 5584.08
just gonna end up literally doing what

5582.219 --> 5586.44
he does right and he's been doing it for

5584.08 --> 5586.44
months

5587.02 --> 5594.159000000001
if you believe some things like that

5590.26 --> 5597.52
it's just stupid you're just blabbering

5594.159 --> 5599.92
garbage that you literally don't think

5597.52 --> 5601.6
about what that actually implies you

5599.92 --> 5604.4800000000005
just don't think about it it makes no

5601.6 --> 5606.96
sense that's why it's exoteric mumbo

5604.48 --> 5606.959999999999
jumbo

5608.02 --> 5611.139
respect everyone's Free Will well I

5610.0 --> 5612.76
don't care

5611.139 --> 5614.82
yeah if you're going to be triggered

5612.76 --> 5619.179
right now over this and you're gonna go

5614.82 --> 5622.32
whatever squirty that's your problem

5619.179 --> 5622.32
it really is

5622.48 --> 5627.82
I've already

5623.98 --> 5630.638999999999
given given Jesus more credit than any

5627.82 --> 5635.08
human that has ever lived if that's not

5630.639 --> 5637.3
good enough for you well screw you then

5635.08 --> 5641.08
whoever you are

5637.3 --> 5644.02
I gave him more credit than anyone that

5641.08 --> 5646.239
has ever lived alright

5644.02 --> 5649.679
that's not good enough for you well then

5646.239 --> 5649.678999999999
you're out of your [Â __Â ] mind

5652.0 --> 5654.179
foreign

5671.699 --> 5677.4
ER right

5673.84 --> 5677.400000000001
in a way indeed

5690.04 --> 5697.179
all right you told me it's my neighbor

5693.159 --> 5699.339999999999
and he read well good fine look I don't

5697.179 --> 5701.7390000000005
care how many different types of Bibles

5699.34 --> 5704.92
that's written in like oh Jesus is his

5701.739 --> 5709.9
father yet that's really cute

5704.92 --> 5712.3
why don't we get to literal reality and

5709.9 --> 5715.599999999999
then Ponder upon that right if you're

5712.3 --> 5719.92
gonna take it absolutely literal

5715.6 --> 5723.820000000001
how many people or things like anything

5719.92 --> 5729.46
out there do you know is its own father

5723.82 --> 5732.5199999999995
yeah zero zero zero zero it's ridiculous

5729.46 --> 5735.2390000000005
it's ridiculous as an ocean right if

5732.52 --> 5737.9800000000005
you're going to take that totally little

5735.239 --> 5740.98
it's ridiculous

5737.98 --> 5740.98
ridiculous

5744.34 --> 5749.8
right

5745.719 --> 5752.32
why would Jesus pray to himself

5749.8 --> 5755.320000000001
if he literally is his own father it

5752.32 --> 5759.46
makes no sense none of it makes sense

5755.32 --> 5763.0599999999995
think about it logically

5759.46 --> 5765.94
stop just buying anything and then

5763.06 --> 5768.400000000001
making your own virtual meaningless

5765.94 --> 5772.36
painting of Glory around it and then

5768.4 --> 5775.179
hold on to that it doesn't mean anything

5772.36 --> 5777.639
that's stupid

5775.179 --> 5780.639
you can't be your own father

5777.639 --> 5783.9400000000005
you're not going to pray to yourself if

5780.639 --> 5787.56
you are that literally that makes no

5783.94 --> 5787.5599999999995
sense stop it

5793.48 --> 5801.718999999999
be careful with hand signs what this

5796.199 --> 5801.719
zero zero zero well what's the problem

5817.239 --> 5822.718999999999
it's the holy truth Jesus yeah no thanks

5824.199 --> 5828.5199999999995
all right

5826.36 --> 5830.38
I think there's a trinity out there but

5828.52 --> 5832.42
it has more to do with the fabric of

5830.38 --> 5835.679
reality itself

5832.42 --> 5835.679
the sub reality

5836.5 --> 5841.54
it means 666 oh really

5839.8 --> 5844.7390000000005
well

5841.54 --> 5844.739
I don't feel that

5845.8 --> 5849.84
pretty sure it's a zero to me

5871.119 --> 5878.259999999999
the hand gesture gives a [Â __Â ]

5874.659 --> 5880.719
isn't a hand gesture basically another

5878.26 --> 5882.9400000000005
form of communication so when you're

5880.719 --> 5885.94
literally in a conversation and you use

5882.94 --> 5888.219
a hand symbol as an extra support to

5885.94 --> 5892.419999999999
what you're literally saying in that

5888.219 --> 5895.0
moment then is it a secret thing that is

5892.42 --> 5898.4800000000005
completely different and find the occult

5895.0 --> 5900.82
meaning blah blah or is it just

5898.48 --> 5903.94
physical assistance to verbal

5900.82 --> 5906.88
communication perhaps right so when I do

5903.94 --> 5910.48
this and I say zero

5906.88 --> 5913.96
does it really mean 666 or does it mean

5910.48 --> 5916.0599999999995
zero like what I said

5913.96 --> 5918.96
right

5916.06 --> 5918.96
think about it

5934.3 --> 5939.219
right yeah George Sanford okay indeed

5937.659 --> 5944.159
okay or

5939.219 --> 5949.38
you could say there's zero problems

5944.159 --> 5949.379999999999
ah ever thought about that

5959.55 --> 5962.589
[Music]

5971.04 --> 5974.58
what does that mean

5986.36 --> 5989.589999999999
[Music]

5991.96 --> 5996.58
okay Ralph Rodriguez I have no idea why

5994.9 --> 5999.179
what does that mean is that some kind of

5996.58 --> 5999.179
a curse word

6001.86 --> 6007.38
it's a knowledge sign oh interesting

6008.94 --> 6011.54
huh

6037.86 --> 6043.739
you make that when you

6041.52 --> 6047.040000000001
when you met when you sit the meditate

6043.739 --> 6049.86
right right I've seen that

6047.04 --> 6051.42
I don't typically like doing that when I

6049.86 --> 6054.0
meditate

6051.42 --> 6058.46
not that I meditate a lot it's just that

6054.0 --> 6058.46
this is not a very comfortable

6058.679 --> 6062.28
thing

6059.639 --> 6065.58
for my hands I prefer to have them close

6062.28 --> 6067.32
together right more like this or

6065.58 --> 6071.36
this

6067.32 --> 6071.36
this is typically what I do

6103.28 --> 6108.44
the decks

6106.34 --> 6112.860000000001
ontological

6108.44 --> 6115.638999999999
Korean Epoch what the [Â __Â ]

6112.86 --> 6115.639
what

6117.9 --> 6124.138999999999
the quranic epoch real what that is

6121.92 --> 6127.28
really a bit of Wizardry

6124.139 --> 6127.28
with the words there

6127.44 --> 6130.46
very amusing

6131.1 --> 6137.88
although yeah look

6134.159 --> 6141.299999999999
it's it's not really joke although it

6137.88 --> 6142.7390000000005
had the Joker oh God it's getting very

6141.3 --> 6146.659000000001
convoluted there

6142.739 --> 6146.659
I appreciate the effort

6150.48 --> 6153.0199999999995
Jokers

6165.179 --> 6171.9800000000005
place your hands on knees and you become

6168.78 --> 6171.98
a pyramid shape yeah

6215.34 --> 6217.88
hmm

6221.58 --> 6224.58
foreign

6224.82 --> 6227.82
away

6237.739 --> 6243.08
yeah I did well

6240.36 --> 6243.08
poor boy

6278.219 --> 6281.219
foreign

6304.739 --> 6308.839999999999
I think I'm gonna run out the show

6309.0 --> 6315.54
kind of growing stale a little

6312.36 --> 6319.92
but uh yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this

6315.54 --> 6322.699
it's quite intense show overall

6319.92 --> 6322.6990000000005
has been

6324.54 --> 6328.76
anyway if what

6330.3 --> 6335.76
uh Chris Berry he's nah he's just

6333.78 --> 6340.699
[Â __Â ] around

6335.76 --> 6340.6990000000005
like ran dude ranty is just

6341.9 --> 6348.48
he has no sense of loyalty at all so he

6346.08 --> 6351.54
doesn't give a [Â __Â ] he's just trying to

6348.48 --> 6353.5199999999995
poke a bee's nest getting all he just

6351.54 --> 6354.96
wants more attention because he's a

6353.52 --> 6358.040000000001
[Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

6354.96 --> 6362.219
nobody gives a [Â __Â ] about a disgusting

6358.04 --> 6365.04
manipulative sociopathic sellout so he's

6362.219 --> 6367.92
just like oh oh well if I'm not getting

6365.04 --> 6369.96
attention I'll just switch and see what

6367.92 --> 6372.719
kind of a Ruckus I can get out it's just

6369.96 --> 6375.6
[Â __Â ] low life

6372.719 --> 6377.34
I really don't care like I literally I

6375.6 --> 6379.5
don't care what he does it doesn't

6377.34 --> 6380.6990000000005
matter what it's going to be I don't

6379.5 --> 6384.179
care

6380.699 --> 6387.0599999999995
literally don't care at all

6384.179 --> 6389.639
because he's a [Â __Â ] loser

6387.06 --> 6392.639
there's no moral compass he smashed it

6389.639 --> 6393.900000000001
he keeps on smashing it

6392.639 --> 6396.92
so

6393.9 --> 6396.92
don't give a [Â __Â ]

6397.26 --> 6401.9400000000005
he must be getting well probably

6399.06 --> 6405.179
probably he probably got a couple of

6401.94 --> 6409.08
Ballers desperate enough to like oh we

6405.179 --> 6412.8
need some kind of symbol of a virtual

6409.08 --> 6414.659
Victory where if just one flat earther

6412.8 --> 6417.54
could come to our side we could have

6414.659 --> 6419.82
some hope that maybe one day the Flat

6417.54 --> 6422.639
Earth there's no stop we'll stop doing

6419.82 --> 6423.96
this order yeah I probably got him that

6422.639 --> 6427.92

6432.6 --> 6436.9800000000005
