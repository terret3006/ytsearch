6.11 --> 36.47
[Music]

36.949 --> 46.14
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.339 --> 50.789
early-bird number 340 I'm your host

46.14 --> 52.589
Arwen and before we start show please

50.789 --> 54.869
don't forget to share it on any platform

52.589 --> 56.789
you deem fit and if you haven't already

54.869 --> 58.439
subscribed to my channel in its a bell

56.789 --> 61.109
notification so you know when I'm going

58.439 --> 62.429
live which is normally 2 p.m. Amsterdam

61.109 --> 65.61
time every day

62.429 --> 67.56
please also do support my show through

65.61 --> 70.89
the paypal patreon my GoFundMe and the

67.56 --> 76.14
super chats especially the first 3

70.89 --> 78.659
because I can really use it so today is

76.14 --> 82.89
actually well despite the chemtrails

78.659 --> 92.34
literally be thrown out there pretty

82.89 --> 95.819
beautiful bright Sun but yeah it seems

92.34 --> 99.47
like they're trying to take it away it's

95.819 --> 99.47
going on right there right now

108.04 --> 122.80000000000001
let's see the cross being established

110.94 --> 125.67999999999999
the bottom half yeah also I have noticed

122.8 --> 129.28
there's just a lot more attention being

125.68 --> 134.74
paid to chemtrails now in media circles

129.28 --> 138.46
for many different angles and it's

134.74 --> 142.75
finally I think it feels like it's

138.46 --> 148.17000000000002
finally overcome that long upheld

142.75 --> 152.14
obstacle of remaining purely speculative

148.17 --> 153.64
conspiracy theory because as everything

152.14 --> 156.51999999999998
else are the other conspiracies the

153.64 --> 159.57999999999998
political conspiracies new world order

156.52 --> 163.27
and all that liberal left as that has

159.58 --> 165.79000000000002
all wealth progressed going a little out

163.27 --> 168.61
of control maybe chemtrails has been

165.79 --> 174.37
relatively left behind it was touched

168.61 --> 179.28
upon every now and then but it seems

174.37 --> 188.05
like now finally it's really being

179.28 --> 189.7
applied an interesting references but

188.05 --> 193.35000000000002
also in the Netherlands hearing more

189.7 --> 193.35
about it that's good

193.56 --> 203.35
I'm not muted thank you very much I can

201.459 --> 207.06
see the sound coming through in my

203.35 --> 207.06
dashboard on OBS

212.86 --> 220.22000000000003
yeah but I do look at the chat and if I

216.5 --> 224.69
recognize the wart mute I'm immediately

220.22 --> 230.75
gonna respond but I'm not muted because

224.69 --> 233.12
I double-checked before I started right

230.75 --> 248.54
anyway I got Tamera coffee with me and

233.12 --> 250.97
tea and that's it for now really

248.54 --> 259.19
spraying it out there currently don't

250.97 --> 262.34
like the looks of that mood very funny

259.19 --> 271.34
so yeah I'm gonna go through chat and

262.34 --> 272.10999999999996
see who is there so EDM was first Amanda

271.34 --> 279.67999999999995
young

272.11 --> 284.21000000000004
ego playing an anchor the studio 68 good

279.68 --> 290.95
times for all stone monkey 3d Julia

284.21 --> 290.95
Pavan dank and the koala courts Howard

292.69 --> 296.89
Brown couldn't pull it for one one

301.059 --> 305.379
Jonah's Zen and the eye

310.21 --> 314.5
okay Jennison

324.83 --> 331.43
that seems kind of contradictory though

327.879 --> 344.09000000000003
let's yeah whatever anyway good to see

331.43 --> 347.06
you all and what have been watching Owen

344.09 --> 352.63899999999995
Benjamin like for all the time he

347.06 --> 354.65
basically seemed to have kept yeah was

352.639 --> 357.05
busying himself with the tour and

354.65 --> 361.96999999999997
everything but now he's just pumping out

357.05 --> 364.61
suddenly like two streams at a time of

361.97 --> 366.91900000000004
sudden so there so there has been a lot

364.61 --> 370.21000000000004
of material for me to catch up and it's

366.919 --> 376.599
it seems like he's pretty strong and

370.21 --> 380.63
he's like really basically coming out as

376.599 --> 382.819
as a more regular flat earther that

380.63 --> 385.219
refuses to be addressed as a flat

382.819 --> 391.389
earther but will basically take on all

385.219 --> 395.33
the points so yeah fully out and

391.389 --> 398.18
especially today's video or from

395.33 --> 401.029
yesterday evening or something man it's

398.18 --> 403.669
it was mostly taboo conspiracy video

401.029 --> 406.669
very long the whole thing is huge I I

403.669 --> 410.50899999999996
haven't finished it let's see where am I

406.669 --> 413.169
at the two hour 8 mark but it's 2 hours

410.509 --> 418.25
41 minutes and it's been just

413.169 --> 420.94899999999996
mind-blowing so much detail that Owen

418.25 --> 423.62
has been digging through so he is really

420.949 --> 427.21000000000004
frame working it he's really getting

423.62 --> 427.21
stuff I'm very impressed

428.53 --> 431.71999999999997
[Music]

439.22 --> 444.38000000000005
yeah exactly ego played an anchor so

442.16 --> 450.16
yeah it's good to see that very

444.38 --> 453.25
encouraging also kind of makes me almost

450.16 --> 456.55
want to take a step back and just

453.25 --> 461.06
reflect upon where things are going now

456.55 --> 463.07
with all the people that are taking the

461.06 --> 465.13
helm as it were or moving in that

463.07 --> 465.13
direction

465.82 --> 475.46
yeah and I need to cool down a bit on

470.09 --> 477.53
watching Star Trek been watching a lot

475.46 --> 480.38
of it although I'm not I haven't reached

477.53 --> 484.13
the third season yet but yeah damn just

480.38 --> 486.62
this second season alone is it is

484.13 --> 488.87
intense compared to the first in the

486.62 --> 490.46
contrast is quite astounding and you

488.87 --> 492.71
really get to see it if you've been to

490.46 --> 499.90999999999997
watch the whole thing

492.71 --> 503.87
the contrast really stands out but yeah

499.91 --> 506.83000000000004
that is what I've been doing kind of

503.87 --> 509.87
really getting into the mood of the I

506.83 --> 512.12
don't know what it is maybe it's about

509.87 --> 514.61
Picard and like the character that he

512.12 --> 517.55
plays like weirdly enough also horseback

514.61 --> 519.59
riding and everything and he's

517.55 --> 526.4799999999999
supposedly French and he seems to be

519.59 --> 529.87
like a philosophy inspired by the

526.48 --> 532.58
positive side you could say of the the

529.87 --> 535.79
reinvention of the French were a French

532.58 --> 537.62
Revolution spirit but yeah without the

535.79 --> 541.9699999999999
dark [ __ ] that we know that it was also

537.62 --> 546.19
part of that just an archetype in a way

541.97 --> 546.19
and yeah so I got

546.36 --> 554.13
like often baked bread and made my own

550.74 --> 557.44
garlic butter and had red wine with it

554.13 --> 560.11
so I had a great evening with that was

557.44 --> 563.9200000000001
kind of weird though because I stuck to

560.11 --> 567.22
that as a dinner just well two big

563.92 --> 580.06
breads and a lot of butter and it was

567.22 --> 580.589
quite it was nice NASA Jonathan okay all

580.06 --> 583.51
right

580.589 --> 587.25
congratulations Jonason with your 35th

583.51 --> 587.25
birthday yes

587.48 --> 590.669
[Music]

603.28 --> 619.6899999999999
I I've heard some rumors as well but no

612.74 --> 624.07
reveals yet I got a hint from from dejan

619.69 --> 624.07
that something had happened apparently

633.63 --> 638.72
and he is in Bulgaria so I don't know

648.019 --> 655.049
well what wasn't specified to me exactly

652.559 --> 657.419
if the tour bus was directly involved

655.049 --> 660.029
but he didn't mention it maybe because

657.419 --> 661.999
that was what where they were at or

660.029 --> 665.449
something I don't know

661.999 --> 669.989
Heisenberg I have no idea about

665.449 --> 678.659
Heisenberg stuff didn't mention anything

669.989 --> 695.0690000000001
about that okay whatever

678.659 --> 697.729
rumors rumors rumors all right

695.069 --> 697.7289999999999
ridiculous

703.029 --> 710.99
yeah those are all just rumors and look

707.99 --> 715.699
I don't know anything about the police

710.99 --> 718.279
there but maybe yeah if they were

715.699 --> 724.459
ordered to get them out of the way I

718.279 --> 727.579
don't know how far they would go so I

724.459 --> 731.149
have no idea this is all just huge rumor

727.579 --> 734.5089999999999
based presuppositions and I'm really not

731.149 --> 736.629
willing to speculate about that well as

734.509 --> 740.139
far as I know only thing I know about

736.629 --> 742.999
what was forwarded to me by dejan was

740.139 --> 746.569
police apparently in that location in

742.999 --> 749.629
the tour bus and no direct hint at

746.569 --> 752.4399999999999
exactly what had happened that's it so

749.629 --> 756.289
let's move on

752.44 --> 756.2890000000001
[Music]

764.71 --> 767.339
yeah

767.41 --> 774.04
I haven't seen any director reference on

769.75 --> 782.59
the in the Skype chat off the globe

774.04 --> 786.79
light tour about it so yeah I'll try to

782.59 --> 788.1700000000001
keep you updated of course if I learn

786.79 --> 792.67
something about it because apparently

788.17 --> 796.8
this is now people are all stoked about

792.67 --> 796.8
the rumors whatever

797.88 --> 804.0
such a waste of time really but yeah it

801.43 --> 804.0
is what it is

810.96 --> 817.0
yeah but I do get it it's it's so

814.63 --> 820.54
they're just art it's an archetype rumor

817.0 --> 823.15
so this could just be [ __ ] from

820.54 --> 827.05
trolls you know because of the boss its

823.15 --> 832.87
bus and police all breaking bad also had

827.05 --> 836.53
a boss so we you know that's the way the

832.87 --> 842.55
general simpleton people start to make

836.53 --> 842.55
rumors and [ __ ] that's how that goes

845.52 --> 853.89
indeed it seems a very tall tale there

865.05 --> 875.3
hello burn fat till my stomach is as

868.62 --> 888.0
flat as the earth 64th what is with 64th

875.3 --> 892.05
or I mean 46th oh yeah that self that's

888.0 --> 895.23
yeah dank I kind of that was weird

892.05 --> 901.31
wasn't it that guy the new guy on this

895.23 --> 908.13
chord he sounded like he was a sped down

901.31 --> 912.6899999999999
rumpus so much the way he rumpus that

908.13 --> 915.47
the the flare of how he spoke it was

912.69 --> 918.6
just like rumpus but a little slower I

915.47 --> 919.4300000000001
was like it's his slowdown clone or

918.6 --> 923.7900000000001
something

919.43 --> 925.04
it's mini rumpus I don't know but that

923.79 --> 934.5799999999999
was hysterical

925.04 --> 934.5799999999999
agreed I wonder how long he will last

944.529 --> 947.489
amen

953.86 --> 966.97
right so um I need to start doing some

963.56 --> 970.43
more prepping with subjects because uh

966.97 --> 974.72
just continually getting and thrilled by

970.43 --> 976.67
material and I'm basically halting in

974.72 --> 980.0
the middle of it and not really thinking

976.67 --> 985.52
of something to talk about it's not

980.0 --> 987.62
really too heavy so let's think about

985.52 --> 993.74
what I have been talking about yep

987.62 --> 995.96
you know it's every time with this type

993.74 --> 1001.53
of light for some reason there's always

995.96 --> 1006.94
a ladybug outbreak here so typical what

1001.53 --> 1011.14
it is but that's been ladybugs always

1006.94 --> 1012.8800000000001
have nests close to where I met at

1011.14 --> 1015.1899999999999
houses and everything maybe maybe

1012.88 --> 1018.12
they're everywhere and I'm just the one

1015.19 --> 1018.12
taking notice but

1023.49 --> 1026.71
[Music]

1036.0 --> 1048.59
yeah that wasn't the subject we want to

1038.459 --> 1050.3700000000001
talk about right the looping concept my

1048.59 --> 1061.49
conceptualization of how the Flat Earth

1050.37 --> 1064.31
could be and some of the data like as

1061.49 --> 1066.21
all the data and the misc

1064.31 --> 1068.6699999999998
conceptualizations and the machinations

1066.21 --> 1073.74
are basically all identified and taken

1068.67 --> 1077.6100000000001
out of the way neutralized and there is

1073.74 --> 1080.61
coming out a more clear picture of the

1077.61 --> 1083.49
technicals compared to for example two

1080.61 --> 1086.9699999999998
years ago when it was all much rougher

1083.49 --> 1088.74
much more guesswork trying to aim at

1086.97 --> 1093.1100000000001
something that seemed consistent there's

1088.74 --> 1098.22
so much more now so many more historical

1093.11 --> 1103.5
technical open references and all that

1098.22 --> 1107.55
that for me as a speculator concerning

1103.5 --> 1109.89
what the yeah what the geometrical

1107.55 --> 1115.44
aspects and the factors are of this

1109.89 --> 1118.23
realm is like I'm now starting to get

1115.44 --> 1121.23
really tested because reality as it were

1118.23 --> 1123.8700000000001
is catching up unto my presuppositional

1121.23 --> 1128.22
speculations and all the things that

1123.87 --> 1131.9699999999998
I've presumed in order to prove the

1128.22 --> 1134.01
looping concept are gonna be tested more

1131.97 --> 1137.04
and more there's more data that will

1134.01 --> 1140.99
come out that will contest potentially

1137.04 --> 1145.1
the concept and I'm starting to feel now

1140.99 --> 1150.9
considering the south of the Equator

1145.1 --> 1153.7099999999998
regions and just a general amount of

1150.9 --> 1153.71
phenomena

1154.59 --> 1160.0
considering for example radar and all

1157.45 --> 1165.929
that there is something there that I

1160.0 --> 1170.44
can't I can't explain the duality

1165.929 --> 1173.47
contrast between north of the Equator

1170.44 --> 1178.539
and south of the equator on a purely

1173.47 --> 1185.1100000000001
linear looping model based concept and

1178.539 --> 1189.27
that's difficult that is also by the way

1185.11 --> 1193.24
why I've already introduced other

1189.27 --> 1196.03
looping other loop concepts like

1193.24 --> 1199.179
irregular loop a half arc loop that kind

1196.03 --> 1202.84
of thing because then there would be a

1199.179 --> 1206.3400000000001
distinct difference already between the

1202.84 --> 1211.35
features of the north and the south part

1206.34 --> 1215.1999999999998
beyond the equator and that could then

1211.35 --> 1218.1399999999999
establish at least a logical nature as

1215.2 --> 1224.6200000000001
in to that there would be significant

1218.14 --> 1228.659
and overcome of all differences so yeah

1224.62 --> 1235.08
it will all be it really will be about

1228.659 --> 1239.8600000000001
the physical establishing of the Equator

1235.08 --> 1243.46
based on on how they delight the Sun

1239.86 --> 1247.09
angles behave of course so that will be

1243.46 --> 1253.39
the guide it's just for us to see how

1247.09 --> 1257.289
that guide is actually physically

1253.39 --> 1261.01
geometrically shaped like a circle as

1257.289 --> 1266.32
the discus always say is it literally a

1261.01 --> 1271.24
circle or is it straight line the base

1266.32 --> 1275.049
line the most basic assumption model

1271.24 --> 1279.669
wise in a looping rectangular concept or

1275.049 --> 1282.85
is it an irregular loop I said that is

1279.669 --> 1289.5700000000002
the equator an arc an incomplete circle

1282.85 --> 1296.23
what is it what is that exact celestial

1289.57 --> 1299.86
relation and that is what I know that is

1296.23 --> 1302.769
the foundation that is it that is really

1299.86 --> 1307.529
the master foundation as to trying to

1302.769 --> 1311.019
understand the spatial interconnection

1307.529 --> 1313.659
what is going on in this world without

1311.019 --> 1316.389
any need of a presupposition of a

1313.659 --> 1318.7
physical literal position by the way of

1316.389 --> 1324.129
any of the celestial objects just purely

1318.7 --> 1327.48
the angular relationships and how those

1324.129 --> 1330.58
change significantly with latitude and

1327.48 --> 1334.69
then establishing where are the lines

1330.58 --> 1338.129
set on the realm and how what is going

1334.69 --> 1341.95
on how does the space interconnect not

1338.129 --> 1343.7199999999998
presupposing a physical geometrical

1341.95 --> 1347.5
shape necessarily but just basically

1343.72 --> 1352.98
going with projection based on direct

1347.5 --> 1356.799
linking and then you can cut it open to

1352.98 --> 1360.25
flatten it out or you could model it

1356.799 --> 1361.99
somehow to kind of represent something

1360.25 --> 1364.809
more physical and I think there's

1361.99 --> 1369.33
already been attempts at it and this is

1364.809 --> 1373.9289999999999
what caught my attention D the map that

1369.33 --> 1375.61
flatters British Martin littke yeah you

1373.929 --> 1380.1390000000001
know we all know it means been around

1375.61 --> 1382.0
forever and he pretty early on before he

1380.139 --> 1384.4599999999998
started his alternative history and

1382.0 --> 1389.409
mudflat series he was always on about

1384.46 --> 1394.3890000000001
that map remember the square map with

1389.409 --> 1396.49
this circle and it was all bendy well I

1394.389 --> 1398.74
think now that I'm thinking back about

1396.49 --> 1401.74
that and I understand much more about

1398.74 --> 1404.289
projections I I'm gonna find the map and

1401.74 --> 1406.779
show it because I do have it would be

1404.289 --> 1413.44
stupid not to show it when I'm talking

1406.779 --> 1416.47
about it hold on but I got a an epiphany

1413.44 --> 1418.72
about what it is what that is

1416.47 --> 1426.309
designer of that projection was trying

1418.72 --> 1431.98
to do I'm pretty sure I'm I'm on that

1426.309 --> 1435.24
good hands here I'm on a good trail mm

1431.98 --> 1435.24
hold on let me find it

1437.58 --> 1441.809
that's it raw thing right

1454.65 --> 1460.52
okay

1457.19 --> 1465.77
I can't find it apparently I didn't save

1460.52 --> 1467.4189999999999
it to my computer silly okay then I

1465.77 --> 1482.83
guess I'm never gonna have to pluck it

1467.419 --> 1487.45
off the internet where's it ah right

1482.83 --> 1492.1999999999998
yeah the square is stationary Earth

1487.45 --> 1494.539
Orlando FERC isn't okay I hope that

1492.2 --> 1498.559
helps

1494.539 --> 1501.2
I know that many of you probably just

1498.559 --> 1503.8999999999999
have a a list of all these projections

1501.2 --> 1506.539
so but that's the one it is that's how

1503.9 --> 1511.3400000000001
it's designated here the Orlando

1506.539 --> 1514.429
Ferguson map so what is that well I'm

1511.34 --> 1522.559
pretty sure now that what that is is a

1514.429 --> 1527.3500000000001
projection to to fix to fix the angular

1522.559 --> 1533.3799999999999
Sun position into one little detail

1527.35 --> 1538.07
pathway I think what they did was they

1533.38 --> 1544.5200000000002
changed the angle of the land into this

1538.07 --> 1547.25
weird doughnut concave thing to change

1544.52 --> 1550.789
the relative angles of those locations

1547.25 --> 1555.159
to where the Sun is in accordance to its

1550.789 --> 1559.9089999999999
cycle and thereby overcoming the

1555.159 --> 1562.0700000000002
inconsistencies that Zacks avala did his

1559.909 --> 1565.7
presentation on the Amsterdam conference

1562.07 --> 1567.86
the angular literal spot where the light

1565.7 --> 1569.78
coming from doesn't match up if you take

1567.86 --> 1575.24
a perfectly flat map so what that

1569.78 --> 1578.12
projection is about is to bend so it's

1575.24 --> 1581.32
not literally its projection Bend it's

1578.12 --> 1584.78
like creating an alternative Sun

1581.32 --> 1587.4399999999998
dimension for the world realm which in

1584.78 --> 1590.29
actuality is all flat in order to fix

1587.44 --> 1596.0800000000002
the Sun position angle

1590.29 --> 1600.7
problem so it is like an a pseudo space

1596.08 --> 1604.21
a pseudo space created bending the real

1600.7 --> 1608.1100000000001
surface things in order to fix the

1604.21 --> 1610.23
celestial position of the Sun which

1608.11 --> 1612.79
would otherwise not match up in any way

1610.23 --> 1615.0
that is what it is so that's something I

1612.79 --> 1615.0
realized

1619.44 --> 1626.919
let me see if I can just show you oh

1625.289 --> 1633.869
it's big

1626.919 --> 1633.8690000000001
oh it is huge okay yeah let me get to it

1635.159 --> 1638.6390000000001
not Skype

1641.49 --> 1657.23
yeah window browser oh dear I hope this

1656.159 --> 1667.22
works

1657.23 --> 1667.22
no it does not okay what

1673.71 --> 1678.2
sorry guys this may take a while

1686.57 --> 1701.37
no cap that's it window capture alrighty

1696.69 --> 1702.98
yeah gotcha bang oh damn that's a little

1701.37 --> 1709.3799999999999
big

1702.98 --> 1709.38
[Music]

1722.95 --> 1731.999
yeah that was my dad don't know why he

1725.919 --> 1731.999
wouldn't be calling anyway let's see I

1733.259 --> 1737.519
got something raw

1756.7 --> 1759.7
hmm

1761.74 --> 1774.28
I don't understand what's gonna hold on

1765.07 --> 1775.8999999999999
sorry this is just City oh my god I've

1774.28 --> 1778.6499999999999
been messing around with the wrong thing

1775.9 --> 1778.65
that was just stupid

1780.63 --> 1788.5
never mind that folks yeah I finally

1784.3 --> 1793.1699999999998
fixed it all right oh no don't do that

1788.5 --> 1793.17
oh dear

1800.77 --> 1810.5
okay so this map thing let me get it

1808.09 --> 1814.73
that one that's what I'm talking about

1810.5 --> 1819.17
and the funny thing is is that basically

1814.73 --> 1821.09
with these de dia that is where the

1819.17 --> 1823.25
effectively the Sun can no longer be

1821.09 --> 1826.01
seen so that would be where the

1823.25 --> 1828.25
relevance of the projection would ran

1826.01 --> 1828.25
out

1856.37 --> 1863.51
crows will be crows and he's a bit of a

1859.35 --> 1863.51
troll actually sometimes

1873.27 --> 1881.19
so anyway that is my thoughts on the

1876.57 --> 1883.5
this specific map and that's what I

1881.19 --> 1886.19
think that it is representing that is

1883.5 --> 1888.48
what that's what it was designed for and

1886.19 --> 1892.29
yeah I hope to get some feedback about

1888.48 --> 1894.63
that maybe that would be good leave it

1892.29 --> 1897.23
in the comments if you need some time to

1894.63 --> 1897.23
think about it

1910.63 --> 1913.63
okay

1935.64 --> 1941.6000000000001
now my ringtone is fine by the way Eagle

1938.97 --> 1941.6000000000001
played an anchor

1960.74 --> 1969.799
why did you timeout Mona King for that I

1963.96 --> 1974.3890000000001
don't get it yeah silly questions but

1969.799 --> 1974.389
you really need to be timed out for that

1978.95 --> 1984.309
yeah oh right

1986.92 --> 1993.39
well you go playing I could technically

1989.62 --> 1998.28
that's not what the wrench is meant for

1993.39 --> 1998.2800000000002
you know please don't abuse it

2001.14 --> 2015.24
Nathan knows house-to-house D knows how

2007.38 --> 2019.5300000000002
to use it just if they go overboard you

2015.24 --> 2025.32
know and they usually do then you can

2019.53 --> 2028.3799999999999
use it unfortunately a wrench does not

2025.32 --> 2037.1699999999998
provide you the ability to force an

2028.38 --> 2039.44
answer out of a troll all right no

2037.17 --> 2039.44
problem

2048.5 --> 2058.29
okay mr. four well that's a sign that

2052.95 --> 2062.06
you're not yeah if you're gonna compare

2058.29 --> 2068.4
some other species to establish

2062.06 --> 2070.56
dominance over them that's I don't know

2068.4 --> 2073.05
the only motivation for me that I could

2070.56 --> 2074.97
think of to do that is that you actually

2073.05 --> 2079.23
don't feel very comfortable with

2074.97 --> 2081.48
yourself in some way in order that for

2079.23 --> 2086.48
for that need to arrive for you to

2081.48 --> 2086.48
actually latch on to just saying

2094.04 --> 2105.5589999999997
all right good for you you can eat

2101.64 --> 2105.5589999999997
whatever you want you know

2115.17 --> 2118.309
[Music]

2125.22 --> 2135.089
ah hey hello Reese yeah doing good it's

2131.66 --> 2138.0299999999997
it's nice and sunny so I'm just keeping

2135.089 --> 2144.9
it cool and yeah I had a good walk

2138.03 --> 2150.8100000000004
earlier and yeah enjoyed just a lot of

2144.9 --> 2154.14
nature out there like geese and Swan and

2150.81 --> 2156.99
it's it's young although it was so big

2154.14 --> 2160.56
and it kind of looked like it was a a

2156.99 --> 2163.5
goose but it wasn't and it squeaked like

2160.56 --> 2167.91
just a little creature but it was huge

2163.5 --> 2169.89
it was yeah I was interesting so

2167.91 --> 2173.7
everybody was quite aware that you have

2169.89 --> 2176.3689999999997
to be careful of swans so I made very

2173.7 --> 2180.21
clear like yeah I understand your

2176.369 --> 2183.6600000000003
authority and I'll at least make it look

2180.21 --> 2186.569
like I'm trying to go around you and

2183.66 --> 2190.0989999999997
that helps swans are very smart actually

2186.569 --> 2190.099
they're sensible

2193.539 --> 2201.5490000000004
and yeah I saw somebody again

2199.269 --> 2206.109
synchronous he saw somebody horseback

2201.549 --> 2208.509
riding and a dog going after a hair like

2206.109 --> 2210.8489999999997
that wasn't part of any plan but there

2208.509 --> 2213.88
was a hair there and man that dog just

2210.849 --> 2216.88
went in went in full instinct berserk

2213.88 --> 2218.7690000000002
and they were chasing huge distances

2216.88 --> 2221.349
through the fields was quite a spectacle

2218.769 --> 2226.569
I don't think he caught it because the

2221.349 --> 2228.279
hair was much quicker but yeah just

2226.569 --> 2236.619
taking a walk you know you get to see

2228.279 --> 2240.449
all the interesting kind of things yes

2236.619 --> 2244.739
Tom Parker you can ask me a question you

2240.449 --> 2244.739
don't have to ask but

2264.22 --> 2267.43
[Music]

2272.52 --> 2275.24
okay

2276.57 --> 2282.15
waiting for that question Tom Parker all

2279.82 --> 2282.15
right

2287.96 --> 2294.38
all right well Tom Parker that claim of

2291.44 --> 2298.58
measuring the distance to the moon is

2294.38 --> 2303.77
originally based on a claimed phenomena

2298.58 --> 2308.12
of a signal rebounds to the moon in some

2303.77 --> 2310.25
way radio signal ham radio even so that

2308.12 --> 2312.95
phenomena as claimed yet I haven't

2310.25 --> 2315.35
really seen any satisfactory evidence

2312.95 --> 2319.25
that there is a phenomena they have

2315.35 --> 2321.89
there are some weird videos out there

2319.25 --> 2325.22
that don't really show it they just show

2321.89 --> 2327.77
a a machine set up and no alteration no

2325.22 --> 2330.3199999999997
actual proof that anything is being

2327.77 --> 2333.08
pointed at the moon and I've already

2330.32 --> 2335.21
laid out exactly what you would need in

2333.08 --> 2340.88
order to satisfy to me that there is a

2335.21 --> 2344.89
moon signal rebounds phenomena that that

2340.88 --> 2348.76
would be viable data and all kinds of

2344.89 --> 2352.2799999999997
whirling around from ballers now that I

2348.76 --> 2354.86
should be the one that I'm lazy I'm the

2352.28 --> 2357.26
one that's supposed to be getting out

2354.86 --> 2359.57
there and finding proof for their claim

2357.26 --> 2361.34
that's what's been going on for a while

2359.57 --> 2364.46
even though I've clearly don't have

2361.34 --> 2366.56
money I can barely go around right now I

2364.46 --> 2369.59
got a bit a bit of a problem now with

2366.56 --> 2375.74
yeah all the Google money being taken

2369.59 --> 2378.98
out of my out of my monthly payment so

2375.74 --> 2380.75
I'm kind of bit screwed as I predicted I

2378.98 --> 2388.79
said this was happening and it's

2380.75 --> 2391.81
happened but the subject I don't have

2388.79 --> 2394.2799999999997
the money they do they could do this and

2391.81 --> 2396.77
they would have all the honor but

2394.28 --> 2401.1200000000003
they're not doing it they're not

2396.77 --> 2403.67
establishing a moon signal rebounds

2401.12 --> 2405.7599999999998
phenomena properly they're not providing

2403.67 --> 2410.21
the real proof for it it's just a lot of

2405.76 --> 2413.57
hearsay and texts and suppose it proof

2410.21 --> 2416.39
but not an actual experiment in the real

2413.57 --> 2418.1000000000004
world and not a real demonstration even

2416.39 --> 2420.62
though they claim that it is supposed to

2418.1 --> 2423.68
be doable so

2420.62 --> 2428.15
that is where you starts that is

2423.68 --> 2431.6299999999997
literally the start in order to even

2428.15 --> 2434.09
begin claiming any kind of physicality

2431.63 --> 2437.2400000000002
to the heavens because that would be the

2434.09 --> 2439.67
start of the evidence that would be the

2437.24 --> 2447.8599999999997
start of something not just purely like

2439.67 --> 2453.94
this or even the possibility to open so

2447.86 --> 2453.94
yeah oh dear

2457.79 --> 2461.0
all right

2461.359 --> 2464.63
yeah let's

2468.22 --> 2472.509
anyway

2470.349 --> 2476.589
it is an interesting map that I will

2472.509 --> 2482.469
think funnily enough also it puts a

2476.589 --> 2483.4
little globe in the corner let's see if

2482.469 --> 2487.569
you can see that

2483.4 --> 2490.509
I'll let scroll it so see that there's a

2487.569 --> 2492.369
little Marten it also pointed this out

2490.509 --> 2495.729
many times there's this little ball with

2492.369 --> 2500.109
people just hanging uh flying through

2495.729 --> 2503.259
space and in that regard it seems

2500.109 --> 2508.38
obvious that the the one that was

2503.259 --> 2514.119
working on this had probably discontent

2508.38 --> 2520.329
toward the globe towards that so he was

2514.119 --> 2522.849
a genuine Cosmo teen is probably

2520.329 --> 2529.6600000000003
somebody that was really working with

2522.849 --> 2534.6890000000003
real data as fascinating anyway yeah I'm

2529.66 --> 2534.689
gonna check

2543.89 --> 2547.0699999999997
[Music]

2550.31 --> 2553.52
thank you

2555.48 --> 2562.61
Thank You Reese you're a good friend man

2563.96 --> 2569.76
also by the way separate from that or

2567.81 --> 2571.68
anything I do want to have a

2569.76 --> 2573.96
conversation with you again over Skype

2571.68 --> 2578.12
so I don't know whenever it's convenient

2573.96 --> 2578.12
to you don't keep yourself up too late

2578.63 --> 2584.94
and I just want to catch up hey if you

2582.93 --> 2587.49
want by the way you could just come on

2584.94 --> 2589.79
the show now it is still like 20 minutes

2587.49 --> 2589.79
ago

2596.589 --> 2605.769
well mr. Ford that depends on where the

2599.529 --> 2610.93
globe is stationed in your house but I

2605.769 --> 2615.069
definitely do dislike it especially if

2610.93 --> 2618.609
it is older nostalgic because it makes

2615.069 --> 2622.329
it more blatant how people are easy to

2618.609 --> 2627.7889999999998
fool and I don't like to be reminded

2622.329 --> 2631.6890000000003
about that sometimes you know it's just

2627.789 --> 2634.15
with the the Globes are wizardry they're

2631.689 --> 2636.3999999999996
an attempt to fool your mind literally

2634.15 --> 2640.719
that just so I just don't like him as I

2636.4 --> 2642.969
used to although I can if I go into for

2640.719 --> 2645.43
example science fiction then yeah I have

2642.969 --> 2648.369
no problem presupposing it as long as I

2645.43 --> 2651.819
stay honest and don't dwell upon these

2648.369 --> 2654.15
things losing track of what is and what

2651.819 --> 2654.15
is not

2661.17 --> 2667.839
and a koala courts in deeds yeah another

2664.599 --> 2670.63
four corners of earth and that just

2667.839 --> 2673.99
makes it kind of weird doesn't it like

2670.63 --> 2678.0
corners in what sense corners the

2673.99 --> 2680.3799999999997
another hate geometrical hint but

2678.0 --> 2688.03
potentially widely interpretive oh I

2680.38 --> 2693.9100000000003
even said it because for example there

2688.03 --> 2697.829
could be four pillars that would

2693.91 --> 2701.02
separate what is above and below and

2697.829 --> 2706.0890000000004
would you not say those are corners in

2701.02 --> 2708.94
the space that has no nothing else but

2706.089 --> 2711.22
those things how do you even try to

2708.94 --> 2713.339
explain the shape of something that is

2711.22 --> 2715.72
just looping in certain directions and

2713.339 --> 2718.599
there's just a few connections well I

2715.72 --> 2727.93
would say like okay let's just call them

2718.599 --> 2732.28
corners so see like yeah but who knows

2727.93 --> 2735.8799999999997
maybe you know certainly sometimes

2732.28 --> 2739.6800000000003
shines in my face in like a weird way

2735.88 --> 2743.5
like the the big black box that they

2739.68 --> 2745.56
like to run around and worship over in

2743.5 --> 2747.94
Mecca that thing that that could be

2745.56 --> 2751.27
potentially a representation of the

2747.94 --> 2753.28
realm maybe it is a giant square and I

2751.27 --> 2757.8
don't know if it would contain a loop at

2753.28 --> 2765.75
it or it would be more like a disk

2757.8 --> 2765.75
within a square it could be I don't know

2776.06 --> 2798.17
that stay at a circle yeah but mr. for

2791.61 --> 2802.26
what would be the circle you know if the

2798.17 --> 2804.69
realm that is exposed to the Sun if that

2802.26 --> 2808.11
word circular then the world the realm

2804.69 --> 2811.29
would be circular would it not I don't

2808.11 --> 2817.4700000000003
think the circle of the earth it is

2811.29 --> 2819.96
about the earth it's not about what is

2817.47 --> 2821.8799999999997
the spacial / what are the spatial

2819.96 --> 2826.86
parameters of the container that's not

2821.88 --> 2831.4100000000003
what it's saying the only hint as to the

2826.86 --> 2835.4
container is the firmament separating

2831.41 --> 2841.3399999999997
above from below and the air in between

2835.4 --> 2841.34
that is what hints at that that's it

2841.37 --> 2846.23
that's what was there I presented it

2856.36 --> 2866.6
yeah didn't I've heard I don't know it's

2864.62 --> 2870.0699999999997
from some source at least julieopp a

2866.6 --> 2872.7799999999997
bond that move through the Jewish

2870.07 --> 2876.11
tradition I've heard that they say that

2872.78 --> 2881.36
their earth realm is God's footstool

2876.11 --> 2891.6200000000003
what is a footstool it's a table with

2881.36 --> 2898.36
legs if it is that is that the physical

2891.62 --> 2901.94
shape right but in what because that

2898.36 --> 2906.8
defines the actual it defines an actual

2901.94 --> 2913.42
shape it defines an object but it does

2906.8 --> 2916.28
not define the space it is in C so

2913.42 --> 2919.4
presupposing looping introducing looping

2916.28 --> 2923.03
well what if it's a footstool it

2919.4 --> 2926.33
spatially resting on itself or what we

2923.03 --> 2932.9900000000002
would experience is a flat place with

2926.33 --> 2936.83
four parasol four pillars covered by the

2932.99 --> 2938.6
flat top which is the bottom of what you

2936.83 --> 2945.17
are actually standing on do you

2938.6 --> 2950.0
understand now why I keep on being

2945.17 --> 2953.81
relatively eager to keep attempting to

2950.0 --> 2957.59
presuppose looping concept and and I

2953.81 --> 2960.5299999999997
mean presupposing looping not as a extra

2957.59 --> 2965.1200000000003
dimensional realm but more trying to

2960.53 --> 2968.8100000000004
establish a potential real element to

2965.12 --> 2970.2999999999997
the existing realm and how to figure out

2968.81 --> 2974.0499999999997
what it is

2970.3 --> 2979.9300000000003
that is what I'm trying to do I'm not

2974.05 --> 2979.9300000000003
trying to create some pseudo are we nyan

2980.09 --> 2989.98
the X space whatever that's not what I'm

2983.87 --> 2989.98
trying to do just for the record all

2992.2 --> 2998.1099999999997
right thank you

2995.09 --> 2998.11
on this you can see

3002.579 --> 3007.929
yep I will call you after the show

3005.829 --> 3016.029
I guess we'd only have 10 minutes left

3007.929 --> 3018.9100000000003
and plenty to talk about right well

3016.029 --> 3024.939
Eagle plane an anchor think carefully

3018.91 --> 3027.519
what if the Book of Enoch is we don't

3024.939 --> 3029.6789999999996
understand the reasons why certain books

3027.519 --> 3031.3489999999997
are not admitted as a core part of the

3029.679 --> 3034.569
Bible do you understand

3031.349 --> 3036.759
we will know that there is definitely a

3034.569 --> 3039.999
reason and then you can see okay what is

3036.759 --> 3042.699
the human reason political things

3039.999 --> 3045.339
keeping secrets to keep the power all

3042.699 --> 3049.809
that but maybe there is another reason

3045.339 --> 3054.759
maybe it is because it was like this

3049.809 --> 3057.579
approved by judgment of God however they

3054.759 --> 3060.699
divine the truth in that it was in the

3057.579 --> 3062.6400000000003
truthfulness of it I can't say the Holy

3060.699 --> 3065.079
Spirit however you want to see it

3062.64 --> 3068.669
because there are technical in

3065.079 --> 3072.489
correctness things that are kind of like

3068.669 --> 3074.109
created by the person themselves because

3072.489 --> 3078.4
they couldn't understand what they were

3074.109 --> 3080.799
seeing that kind of thing so maybe there

3078.4 --> 3082.7690000000002
are just in correctness in it and that's

3080.799 --> 3085.119
why it's not that minute that is

3082.769 --> 3086.7389999999996
presuming that it does contain

3085.119 --> 3093.069
absolutely it would have to contain

3086.739 --> 3095.289
total truth by that baseline assumption

3093.069 --> 3097.479
and that is that therefore that it made

3095.289 --> 3102.0690000000004
it not because of the content of the

3097.479 --> 3107.499
rest of the story the explanations I I

3102.069 --> 3111.449
don't know but yeah the Gateway is a

3107.499 --> 3111.4489999999996
fascinating thing it kind of does

3111.659 --> 3115.9
remember I did that piece about the

3114.099 --> 3119.309
rectangular looping model and how

3115.9 --> 3122.739
potentially what if the people within

3119.309 --> 3127.059
would be able to manipulate the loop for

3122.739 --> 3129.309
through for example now getting science

3127.059 --> 3131.7690000000002
fictiony in a biblical sense using

3129.309 --> 3134.4990000000003
certain sound frequencies that would

3131.769 --> 3135.49
sound like horns the horns would open

3134.499 --> 3139.24
the gate

3135.49 --> 3143.08
and maybe even references of the dinar

3139.24 --> 3146.14
engaged to hell maybe that is towards a

3143.08 --> 3149.83
certain direction where the loops are

3146.14 --> 3155.3199999999997
closed but there is stuff there there is

3149.83 --> 3156.97
other land there and maybe there even

3155.32 --> 3159.76
know other realms that are just

3156.97 --> 3161.98
completely overlooked maybe there's

3159.76 --> 3165.21
realms there that are closed off and

3161.98 --> 3169.93
that are just really have been peaceful

3165.21 --> 3174.18
from the very very start right after

3169.93 --> 3177.7599999999998
creation that have just been overlooked

3174.18 --> 3179.8599999999997
because what they would never intervene

3177.76 --> 3182.5800000000004
in anything they would never alter the

3179.86 --> 3185.4100000000003
original design for it so maybe

3182.58 --> 3191.1
speculation lots and lots and lots of

3185.41 --> 3191.1
speculation possibilities

3197.46 --> 3203.069
oh that's a good question actually pass

3199.8 --> 3204.15
away tow it's stuff how do you wake up

3203.069 --> 3209.19
from the lies

3204.15 --> 3212.869
well you gotta find valuable ground

3209.19 --> 3218.579
within truth that's how you do it

3212.869 --> 3220.65
why people get shocked by truth and

3218.579 --> 3222.869
figure out that they're actually

3220.65 --> 3225.2400000000002
believing lies but then defend against

3222.869 --> 3227.369
it it is because when exposed to the

3225.24 --> 3230.3999999999996
light they don't see any fireable ground

3227.369 --> 3233.099
they've become dependent upon the lie in

3230.4 --> 3235.579
their way of life and that's what makes

3233.099 --> 3239.4900000000002
it really tough so if you want to

3235.579 --> 3243.5
believe if you see it like that from a

3239.49 --> 3246.2099999999996
switch suspense of disbelief point as a

3243.5 --> 3248.22
global ever if you really want to make

3246.21 --> 3254.01
that switch then you gotta find viable

3248.22 --> 3258.0789999999997
grounds doing that you've got to

3254.01 --> 3261.059
understand what's going on and find

3258.079 --> 3264.7200000000003
riches in that intellectual and personal

3261.059 --> 3267.78
riches you rediscover God rediscover the

3264.72 --> 3269.3999999999996
energy and the blessings of God that are

3267.78 --> 3271.67
really there that are not just a false

3269.4 --> 3271.67
claim

3276.95 --> 3299.8999999999996
Oh myself oh how disappointing well you

3296.54 --> 3303.83
can tell me about what I lied pass away

3299.9 --> 3306.89
tow and then if we can confirm that I

3303.83 --> 3311.15
did lie then then we'll figure out how I

3306.89 --> 3312.68
wake up from them okay so go you're you

3311.15 --> 3315.83
think you're a troll you think you just

3312.68 --> 3319.43
do that that's fine you know even troll

3315.83 --> 3323.21
questions and people try you know what I

3319.43 --> 3328.22
answer all of them yeah because you

3323.21 --> 3331.1
can't out troll me with inquiries to

3328.22 --> 3333.83
truth no matter how you politicize what

3331.1 --> 3341.81
you put down there so ask me your

3333.83 --> 3345.3199999999997
question buddy ask me your question tell

3341.81 --> 3347.5099999999998
me what I lied about what lie I need to

3345.32 --> 3350.1200000000003
wake up from and now we're gonna get

3347.51 --> 3353.42
technical with lie because what is a lie

3350.12 --> 3356.15
lies not a mistake lie is a conscious

3353.42 --> 3359.9300000000003
decision to evade the truth so point me

3356.15 --> 3362.39
where you can prove that I lied that I'm

3359.93 --> 3365.97
not that I perfect that I purposely

3362.39 --> 3367.24
evade truth tell me where that happened

3365.97 --> 3369.68
[Music]

3367.24 --> 3373.7799999999997
where I have I not been honest about

3369.68 --> 3373.7799999999997
what I'm doing what I'm talking about

3388.49 --> 3400.25
yeah okay red cream dream

3391.79 --> 3407.3
well let's not do that okay pass away

3400.25 --> 3410.21
toh good point see typical I I take new

3407.3 --> 3415.2200000000003
people as trolls the slide because

3410.21 --> 3417.89
people try to hide they go undercover in

3415.22 --> 3420.47
my chat so I'm extremely suspicious so

3417.89 --> 3421.1299999999997
that's where that response came from

3420.47 --> 3425.0499999999997
okay

3421.13 --> 3432.08
so how did I step away from it with huge

3425.05 --> 3434.3300000000004
difficulty huge difficulty that's why

3432.08 --> 3436.97
I've been exposed to flat earth all

3434.33 --> 3440.33
throughout my life just like four or

3436.97 --> 3443.72
five six times and I couldn't handle it

3440.33 --> 3445.88
I could presuppose it but I couldn't in

3443.72 --> 3448.45
the end it would like an elastic just

3445.88 --> 3450.8900000000003
snap me back in the dream and get me

3448.45 --> 3454.52
working on that and and I know a

3450.89 --> 3458.5
retrospect why because I have a lot of

3454.52 --> 3461.33
life frustrations I find my life

3458.5 --> 3464.75
frustrating in a way but I've also come

3461.33 --> 3468.91
to learn as to why like it's part of

3464.75 --> 3472.37
what I am Who I am what am I doing here

3468.91 --> 3474.62
alright and that is what keeps you in if

3472.37 --> 3477.92
you can't handle life that makes you

3474.62 --> 3480.92
more vulnerable to the dream - the dream

3477.92 --> 3486.98
an escapist dream of the globe and all

3480.92 --> 3491.36
of it and what it stands for that's why

3486.98 --> 3493.64
I kept slipping back I lost respect from

3491.36 --> 3498.35
some people that don't really care about

3493.64 --> 3500.69
it in retrospect because of it at the

3498.35 --> 3504.5
time and I didn't understand because I

3500.69 --> 3507.5
couldn't because I couldn't handle the

3504.5 --> 3509.99
truth even though I understood it was

3507.5 --> 3512.36
there I understood a dual reality that I

3509.99 --> 3514.64
was stuck in some kind of other reality

3512.36 --> 3517.6400000000003
even as I was stuck there and realized

3514.64 --> 3520.39
that there is an alternative thing going

3517.64 --> 3522.49
on that I was viable in some way I could

3520.39 --> 3526.79
not

3522.49 --> 3528.5899999999997
abandon what I was a part of what I was

3526.79 --> 3531.29
thinking about what I was dreaming about

3528.59 --> 3535.01
and the promises that were given with

3531.29 --> 3537.85
those dreams that I latched onto with

3535.01 --> 3540.9500000000003
almost with this pair at the time I

3537.85 --> 3545.0
needed some some kind of dream very

3540.95 --> 3550.72
young to inspire me to make it all worth

3545.0 --> 3553.37
it all the craziness everywhere and that

3550.72 --> 3556.6699999999996
was the globe at first and there's a lot

3553.37 --> 3559.43
of material in media to do that and they

3556.67 --> 3562.4300000000003
program you with liberal ideas and at

3559.43 --> 3566.27
first it's like yeah okay I get that

3562.43 --> 3568.37
and now what they do they do it on a

3566.27 --> 3572.66
totally different level now it's so

3568.37 --> 3575.75
aggressive so unnatural a lot of it is

3572.66 --> 3578.72
they do make us exit some exceptions

3575.75 --> 3583.82
here now thank that's for their own

3578.72 --> 3587.0299999999997
survival too probably but I can't stick

3583.82 --> 3593.7400000000002
to that dream anymore because it's just

3587.03 --> 3596.4500000000003
the ones upholding it are are seemingly

3593.74 --> 3598.43
abandoning it or allowing to undergo a

3596.45 --> 3603.29
dark transformation that makes the

3598.43 --> 3605.44
original purpose senseless so that can't

3603.29 --> 3610.16
work anymore but that doesn't mean that

3605.44 --> 3614.35
elements that drove me within it that I

3610.16 --> 3618.29
cannot make them my own my own separate

3614.35 --> 3622.0699999999997
ideals you could call it and hopes with

3618.29 --> 3624.29
methods and then there's even so much

3622.07 --> 3627.77
more ways of thinking that have spawned

3624.29 --> 3630.89
since then like the German new medicine

3627.77 --> 3634.46
approach so much more psychological

3630.89 --> 3639.3799999999997
viability in in figuring things out and

3634.46 --> 3643.31
just there is so much more now than just

3639.38 --> 3645.6800000000003
that dream I don't need it anymore I

3643.31 --> 3650.33
don't need it to latch on to in order to

3645.68 --> 3652.31
have hope for the future I have a lot of

3650.33 --> 3655.79
real hope for the future because I

3652.31 --> 3659.859
understand how much promise

3655.79 --> 3659.859
real things have for us

3667.97 --> 3671.2599999999998
Oh God

3681.11 --> 3689.31
now jam Panda what I try to explain and

3684.86 --> 3692.9700000000003
this is all honest okay what keeps

3689.31 --> 3700.59
people to the globe is emotional need

3692.97 --> 3705.4399999999996
there's it's a source of comfort and it

3700.59 --> 3708.15
is a great consolidation price basically

3705.44 --> 3712.44
temporarily but you're also being

3708.15 --> 3714.35
subjected by people that fool around

3712.44 --> 3723.54
with you because of it

3714.35 --> 3725.7599999999998
try to hurt you into certain things if

3723.54 --> 3729.39
you just switch to reality then you

3725.76 --> 3732.1800000000003
figure out that what things are really

3729.39 --> 3735.33
like without the necessity of having to

3732.18 --> 3736.98
literally solidify every single thing

3735.33 --> 3741.33
and put it all into formulas and all

3736.98 --> 3743.73
that then you will still know not

3741.33 --> 3746.4
through reason in a direct sense but

3743.73 --> 3748.29
through experience through your sensor

3746.4 --> 3752.9100000000003
ease and the preponderance of everything

3748.29 --> 3755.99
you experience you will hear what is

3752.91 --> 3760.92
real and what is not where it's going

3755.99 --> 3764.58
for real that is what helps so much it

3760.92 --> 3769.89
clears up so much more about what's not

3764.58 --> 3772.11
gonna happen and yeah that is because

3769.89 --> 3774.42
that clarity was missing and things are

3772.11 --> 3777.3
just super dynamic and anything can be

3774.42 --> 3779.4300000000003
in in the globe world that's why that is

3777.3 --> 3781.38
very restless is constantly meteors

3779.43 --> 3785.3399999999997
flying by potentially destroying us and

3781.38 --> 3786.2400000000002
a virus in our war nuclear war well

3785.34 --> 3789.6600000000003
that's the thing

3786.24 --> 3793.1699999999996
once you figure out what is real in the

3789.66 --> 3799.68
world around you without having the

3793.17 --> 3802.13
false luxury of thinking that you know

3799.68 --> 3805.7999999999997
everything about it then you suddenly

3802.13 --> 3811.5
lose the insecurities that are injected

3805.8 --> 3812.9100000000003
with the globe lie and you become more

3811.5 --> 3816.269
comfortable

3812.91 --> 3820.46
about the real world and therefore lose

3816.269 --> 3824.839
the necessity to escape in the fantasy

3820.46 --> 3829.109
off the globe so that's how that works

3824.839 --> 3831.0589999999997
