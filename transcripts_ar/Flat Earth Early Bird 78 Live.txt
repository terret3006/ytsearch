22.05 --> 31.26
about you my older so it's really it's

26.099 --> 33.53
outside actually and yeah sorry I'm a

31.26 --> 35.969
little bit late yeah

33.53 --> 39.21
bumped into somebody interesting that I

35.969 --> 43.230000000000004
knew and I told him about the show and

39.21 --> 45.21
they were very interested I tried to not

43.23 --> 49.038999999999994
hang around but it just couldn't help it

45.21 --> 56.399
and took like 50 minutes too long so

49.039 --> 59.120000000000005
that's why I'm an why I'm late so what

56.399 --> 59.120000000000005
are you doing it yeah

61.989 --> 67.32
choose Daniel Steve Hagrid wells

70.729 --> 80.049
psychics Warriors Andrea browning so

76.28 --> 80.049
good to see you guys over McCool

97.52 --> 103.19
I got so much going through me like

101.27 --> 105.53
moment a moment like even in that

103.19 --> 109.46
conversation with the guy it cost me to

105.53 --> 113.92
be late that I'm just looking at it like

109.46 --> 113.91999999999999
oh my god how am I ever gonna explain

114.7 --> 125.479
that should I you know yeah getting

122.509 --> 129.789
vague here but I really need somebody to

125.479 --> 133.7
reflect on otherwise which is gonna be

129.789 --> 136.61999999999998
bouncing all over the place in my mind

133.7 --> 141.17999999999998
[Music]

136.62 --> 144.45000000000002
so yeah the Flat Earth debates have

141.18 --> 147.56
started up again and Nathan has a

144.45 --> 150.209
separate channel Flat Earth debate and

147.56 --> 152.66
yeah it does the Flat Earth debates

150.209 --> 155.33
they're just like in the old days

152.66 --> 159.03
there's just like a few months ago

155.33 --> 163.92000000000002
and I already joined that panel and it

159.03 --> 164.73
was good to be back and yeah so if you

163.92 --> 170.42
didn't know

164.73 --> 172.82899999999998
check out Flat Earth debate Channel

170.42 --> 175.55999999999997
maybe a little bit tough to find you

172.829 --> 178.22
know what I'll post a link in the chat

175.56 --> 178.22
right here

181.94 --> 189.10999999999999
and yeah I think Nathan's got it pretty

185.12 --> 194.0
much times synchronous like like before

189.11 --> 196.37
so yeah after this show is over do go

194.0 --> 200.71
and take a look at Flat Earth debates

196.37 --> 204.34
channel and watch the Flat Earth debates

200.71 --> 211.25
yeah so it's good to have that back

204.34 --> 213.35
let's see where it goes from there and

211.25 --> 216.71
hopefully Nathan will eventually get

213.35 --> 219.97
back to her his bigger channel because

216.71 --> 222.67000000000002
yeah this new channel is kind of small

219.97 --> 225.47
so he's not gonna get the same kind of

222.67 --> 228.92
revenue out of it the advertisement and

225.47 --> 232.66
everything it's yeah but at least he can

228.92 --> 235.42999999999998
do live streams with open panels again

232.66 --> 237.68
and I think he's like restreaming it all

235.43 --> 243.01000000000002
through the other channels anyway by

237.68 --> 243.01000000000002
premiering them again so

250.58 --> 259.34000000000003
I had an interesting gaming night

252.56 --> 263.96
yesterday and had a confrontation in a

259.34 --> 268.21
way indirect what's really weird so yeah

263.96 --> 270.83
I I told you guys before like yeah I

268.21 --> 275.69
know a couple of Jenna transgender

270.83 --> 277.7
people too that I consider my friends

275.69 --> 283.78
one of them in the gaming group and they

277.7 --> 285.76
apparently it's like weird they had a a

283.78 --> 289.72999999999996
confrontation with a person that

285.76 --> 292.90999999999997
unwittingly used old-fashioned language

289.73 --> 299.72
and like assumed the wrong gender yeah

292.91 --> 303.52000000000004
and she he they got really angry over

299.72 --> 307.03000000000003
that and it's like oh my god that's

303.52 --> 310.15999999999997
looks kind of familiar and it's like I

307.03 --> 312.53
wanted to say like yeah but come on you

310.16 --> 315.17
know it's not really hostile intention I

312.53 --> 319.54999999999995
know and they just thought like no just

315.17 --> 320.75
gonna not poke that any more than I

319.55 --> 325.16
needs that

320.75 --> 327.62
yeah it's pokey enough as it is and it's

325.16 --> 331.49
kind of odd like because yeah it is I

327.62 --> 335.87
have my opinions about that but on the

331.49 --> 339.89
other hand I do kind of get the personal

335.87 --> 344.21
frustration so odd so I have somebody

339.89 --> 348.11
that you personally know bring that

344.21 --> 350.12
forth when I normally get to see that

348.11 --> 352.34000000000003
kind of crap from the other side through

350.12 --> 355.34000000000003
the Alex Jones Show and while those

352.34 --> 360.04999999999995
people do go completely apeshit nuts and

355.34 --> 363.40999999999997
even aggressive like he does not he's a

360.05 --> 365.99
very decent person but yeah with emotion

363.41 --> 369.8
so he didn't really get pissed off of

365.99 --> 373.54
brick not aggressive though it's just so

369.8 --> 373.54
odd this world it's so weird

373.86 --> 384.189
so that happened and of course the game

377.59 --> 390.60999999999996
happened and I was confronted by a very

384.189 --> 394.24
odd element of the of the liberal way of

390.61 --> 397.75
thinking like really weird it's almost

394.24 --> 399.789
like oh really it's like are you seeing

397.75 --> 402.789
what you're doing right now because yeah

399.789 --> 405.06899999999996
what happens in this game the the

402.789 --> 408.099
players are basically adventurers and

405.069 --> 411.969
they're very powerful and they have a

408.099 --> 414.729
lot of money and the rules it is what

411.969 --> 416.74
their characters religions tell them

414.729 --> 420.46
pretty much what the rules are and these

416.74 --> 421.539
people are all pretty wild and free and

420.46 --> 424.659
wild

421.539 --> 427.12
and neutral so it's like all over the

424.659 --> 432.699
place what they do know really nasty

427.12 --> 436.05
[ __ ] but it's like yeah their main goal

432.699 --> 439.389
is to make everything into a giant party

436.05 --> 443.58
like with one character religiously so

439.389 --> 448.21000000000004
it's like very awesome like a party god

443.58 --> 449.62
it's weird but yeah they have because of

448.21 --> 451.089
their strengths because of their power

449.62 --> 454.029
because of their wealth they have kind

451.089 --> 456.129
of an automatic managing function almost

454.029 --> 458.77
like an oligarchy effect because they

456.129 --> 461.97900000000004
are strong and they have money to take

458.77 --> 464.409
care of or to get involved with things

461.979 --> 468.12899999999996
that happen in their village in their

464.409 --> 470.229
growing village in their City and I

468.129 --> 472.3
confronted them like oh yeah remember

470.229 --> 475.419
they're still like all these poor people

472.3 --> 479.02000000000004
that were sent from overseas and just

475.419 --> 481.779
hanging around being bums and I was like

479.02 --> 483.85999999999996
yeah yeah poking poking yeah you know

481.779 --> 487.73
Europe

483.86 --> 491.03000000000003
and let's see what they did and yeah the

487.73 --> 494.78000000000003
most liberal person you could say among

491.03 --> 496.729
us just started saying like yeah yeah we

494.78 --> 500.9
need to put them all in factories and

496.729 --> 503.99
give them some work to do and like so

500.9 --> 506.59999999999997
you mean like enslave them no no that's

503.99 --> 509.3
it'll be great for them and it's so

506.6 --> 510.02000000000004
weird to see that just naturally spring

509.3 --> 517.279
up again

510.02 --> 521.5699999999999
from the liberal side it's very it is

517.279 --> 524.9
kind of a right wing socialist way of

521.57 --> 527.3900000000001
thinking like let's put things to use

524.9 --> 531.23
very pragmatic and it is admirable but

527.39 --> 537.1
to see that spring for so naturally well

531.23 --> 537.1
in this world yeah

538.72 --> 542.59
it's you're not supposed to do that

541.21 --> 545.44
you're not supposed to think like that

542.59 --> 548.5
but in the game apparently there's no

545.44 --> 551.9200000000001
objection and it's so weird to me like

548.5 --> 556.69
really is there really a difference so

551.92 --> 558.51
on this world but yeah the game was good

556.69 --> 564.1600000000001
and their plan was sound they basically

558.51 --> 567.73
wants to put the newbies to work in in a

564.16 --> 569.77
diamond mine yeah they just happen to

567.73 --> 576.48
have one of them bumped into it in a

569.77 --> 579.13
very far trip into the Iceland yeah

576.48 --> 582.3100000000001
shouldn't be too hard and it's not gonna

579.13 --> 583.72
be like a a messy death ii situation or

582.31 --> 584.9799999999999
something it's not like they wanted to

583.72 --> 588.39
really get rid of them you know just

584.98 --> 588.39
generally no they just put him to work

590.82 --> 596.5200000000001
that was good

594.03 --> 598.68
the in de plane de is good and it's very

596.52 --> 602.04
interesting to see just how these

598.68 --> 605.31
individuals respond with their essence

602.04 --> 607.77
with their characters derived from the

605.31 --> 611.04
actual people in real life that they are

607.77 --> 612.9
how they respond to these power

611.04 --> 615.63
situations what is their natural

612.9 --> 618.48
response what seems natural to them in

615.63 --> 622.52
tune with their personal essence of the

618.48 --> 622.52
character and the real person

624.67 --> 628.3499999999999
the indie gaming it's awesome

635.48 --> 638.86
yeah my panel is open

651.74 --> 660.8100000000001
Daniel complaining yeah sorry Daniel no

657.68 --> 665.16
look George

660.81 --> 669.1199999999999
deserved everything he got okay he

665.16 --> 671.4599999999999
worked he went out of his way to ensure

669.12 --> 673.71
that a person that believes something

671.46 --> 677.6700000000001
that he doesn't agree with gets fired

673.71 --> 681.21
okay he deserves everything that came to

677.67 --> 684.66
him it's really really silly to think

681.21 --> 687.5600000000001
that he was mistreated somehow after

684.66 --> 687.56
everything that he's done

708.449 --> 712.049
let's calm down

725.18 --> 730.06
yeah there's so much I could talk about

727.49 --> 730.0600000000001
but

731.72 --> 737.09
I'm talking it's just I don't wanna I

734.78 --> 744.0799999999999
want somebody here get in my freaking

737.09 --> 746.1800000000001
panel got in my panel I need some I need

744.08 --> 749.2700000000001
something talked about to reflect on I

746.18 --> 751.37
want to answer questions it's much

749.27 --> 756.68
harder to just throw stuff out there

751.37 --> 759.43
just from out of my head unless I have a

756.68 --> 759.43
lot to process

762.48 --> 767.46
and of course there is a lot happening

764.25 --> 770.66
in the world but I already seem to be

767.46 --> 775.77
very quick at just putting pretty

770.66 --> 778.11
elaborate analysis with like energy

775.77 --> 779.55
strings and how it's gonna change and

778.11 --> 783.51
everything I put it out there really

779.55 --> 786.9
quickly with with new things so can we

783.51 --> 792.15
start repeating that no it's not it's

786.9 --> 795.75
boring but answering questions clearing

792.15 --> 797.78
up misunderstandings or showing people

795.75 --> 802.76
things that they have trouble looking

797.78 --> 802.76
yeah that's I can definitely do that

823.14 --> 827.779
right close-up shots off the moon goodie

825.69 --> 834.3290000000001
well I've seen them before

827.779 --> 841.55
no you know crow triple7 had some really

834.329 --> 841.55
amazing close-up moon footage years ago

843.54 --> 846.139
Hey

859.21 --> 867.4000000000001
yeah yeah talk about something dark

861.64 --> 871.15
world ish again I remember of course

867.4 --> 873.31
seeing Eric today in 2011 but I also

871.15 --> 879.22
remembered just hearing about the moon

873.31 --> 883.1099999999999
ripple then I don't know when did he do

879.22 --> 883.11
that when

883.74 --> 889.5
when did crow triple seven seven first

886.44 --> 894.2900000000001
bring forth the moon Ripple when did he

889.5 --> 898.07
start up his channel I don't remember

894.29 --> 898.0699999999999
but I thought

898.44 --> 910.44
I saw it at the talk about it in 2013

904.53 --> 914.15
now wait 2011 not sure anymore but

910.44 --> 919.46
definitely remembering seeing about it

914.15 --> 923.15
before I bumped into him on YouTube

919.46 --> 923.1500000000001
after 2015

964.12 --> 966.149
I

983.1 --> 986.15
I have some

986.639 --> 993.11
pretty deep speculations about the whole

989.339 --> 996.9290000000001
situation with America United States

993.11 --> 1000.41
what's actually going on there team

996.929 --> 1003.399
Trump and the deep state what that is

1000.41 --> 1003.399
what all of it is

1004.79 --> 1011.0899999999999
and yeah it's getting pretty weird

1007.61 --> 1012.65
because yeah yesterday entire Infowars I

1011.09 --> 1015.11
didn't get to see at all but was

1012.65 --> 1022.34
completely dedicated to apparently Roger

1015.11 --> 1025.24
stone these show people was basically I

1022.34 --> 1029.06
don't think Swati but they came over to

1025.24 --> 1031.91
do something it was quite weird they

1029.06 --> 1033.53
like put alarm bells all over the place

1031.91 --> 1040.49
but apparently something happened or

1033.53 --> 1042.8899999999999
he's being arrested or so much bruja and

1040.49 --> 1046.8700000000001
of course suggesting that the deep state

1042.89 --> 1046.8700000000001
is taking down the resistance and

1049.2 --> 1053.3
it doesn't really make any sense to me

1057.69 --> 1067.17
and I get this really weird feeling

1061.13 --> 1071.0300000000002
again about Trump like

1067.17 --> 1073.92
he could probably have so much more grip

1071.03 --> 1078.66
over the code of conducts with so many

1073.92 --> 1082.3400000000001
things and why is he not taking it why

1078.66 --> 1082.3400000000001
is he not reaching out

1084.02 --> 1090.46
why is he letting the deeps that do what

1086.48 --> 1094.46
he does what they do in so many fronts

1090.46 --> 1099.26
does he think that there's no way around

1094.46 --> 1103.8500000000001
them that they are much that they're

1099.26 --> 1107.12
even part of his own the entire

1103.85 --> 1110.4199999999998
government yeah then what is going on

1107.12 --> 1111.8899999999999
here it is so weird like you would think

1110.42 --> 1114.23
you would imagine that he just said no

1111.89 --> 1117.89
just stop this injustice and we'll do it

1114.23 --> 1119.27
like this and that seems so easy so why

1117.89 --> 1123.0400000000002
is it not happening why is there no

1119.27 --> 1123.04
responses to these kind of things why

1124.48 --> 1132.5
does he really have all this grip or is

1127.73 --> 1138.02
he just the face the face and the style

1132.5 --> 1142.309
of the presidential face the cultural

1138.02 --> 1145.04
representative is that is that the only

1142.309 --> 1147.32
thing he has really and just his

1145.04 --> 1149.33
business way of doing things and which

1147.32 --> 1152.54
he is pretty interested

1149.33 --> 1154.55
and again I got oh my god seriously

1152.54 --> 1159.23
I have to talk about this for a moment

1154.55 --> 1161.78
when I when I went to the gaming night

1159.23 --> 1164.42
yeah there's this guy friend of mine

1161.78 --> 1167.6
basically picks up several people to go

1164.42 --> 1169.3400000000001
to the place we play we had to talk

1167.6 --> 1171.23
about Trump and everything and he told

1169.34 --> 1173.6299999999999
me like yeah I don't really watch the

1171.23 --> 1177.98
news at all because I know most of it's

1173.63 --> 1180.3500000000001
just a mess and probably fake news so I

1177.98 --> 1182.8700000000001
don't really trust everything but yeah

1180.35 --> 1185.809
there have been these concerns that

1182.87 --> 1188.75
apparently Trump has been building FEMA

1185.809 --> 1193.61
camps and oh everyone it's like oh my

1188.75 --> 1196.01
god dude Jesus Christ like those things

1193.61 --> 1199.4599999999998
were built like 20 years ago and Alex

1196.01 --> 1201.2
Jones made movies and describing how

1199.46 --> 1206.03
they were being built like and now the

1201.2 --> 1208.7
liberal media is apparently telling

1206.03 --> 1211.69
everyone that it's true that put it

1208.7 --> 1211.69
there it's just

1212.01 --> 1215.01
god

1217.62 --> 1223.6789999999999
like you can't seriously believe that

1220.13 --> 1226.2
you know you know the only reason he

1223.679 --> 1230.549
would even do anything with those camps

1226.2 --> 1234.5900000000001
as backup plan FEMA camps is to just get

1230.549 --> 1237.36
some kind of financial loss minimization

1234.59 --> 1239.58
because ya chump is always the pragmatic

1237.36 --> 1242.549
guy when it comes to finances so if he

1239.58 --> 1245.1589999999999
sees a loss like okay these fema camps

1242.549 --> 1247.95
that's crazy deep state planned we're

1245.159 --> 1251.669
not gonna do that like that so let's

1247.95 --> 1255.0
yeah not destroy it and just have pure

1251.669 --> 1257.64
losses maybe we can build something good

1255.0 --> 1261.179
out of it I'd imagine that that would be

1257.64 --> 1264.2700000000002
typically how he would have engaged in

1261.179 --> 1268.14
that and then the liberal media said oh

1264.27 --> 1271.26
look Trump building FEMA camps so he's

1268.14 --> 1274.7
going to be not see you it's just uh my

1271.26 --> 1277.7
god ah really

1274.7 --> 1277.7
really

1283.33 --> 1286.889
yeah it's just so silly

1293.14 --> 1301.23
yeah exactly tinfoil Hatter's those FEMA

1297.73 --> 1304.57
camps they've been around for 20 years

1301.23 --> 1308.29
Alex Jones like even during the Obama

1304.57 --> 1310.48
era Alex Jones was like oh my god the

1308.29 --> 1313.72
FEMA camps Obama's gonna use him so he

1310.48 --> 1316.23
was kind of doing what the left is now

1313.72 --> 1320.5
doing but yeah the left is just saying

1316.23 --> 1323.35
like Oh Trump just built these for all

1320.5 --> 1327.34
of us he's going to be the Nazi this

1323.35 --> 1329.049
just it's worse it's worse than just

1327.34 --> 1330.1
like oh he could use it we could use it

1329.049 --> 1334.299
we have to be careful have to be

1330.1 --> 1336.4599999999998
prepared no just whatever the other had

1334.299 --> 1340.12
it's just exactly the same thing the

1336.46 --> 1341.71
freaking left/right [ __ ] they do exactly

1340.12 --> 1345.1299999999999
the same [ __ ]

1341.71 --> 1346.24
exactly exactly it's not even know

1345.13 --> 1351.4
exactly the same

1346.24 --> 1354.51
oh my god politicization is the bane of

1351.4 --> 1354.51
all knowledge

1359.87 --> 1363.85
so yeah apparently that's going around

1369.55 --> 1380.9199999999998
and Oh again concerning Venezuela it's

1377.73 --> 1383.32
like I think I gave a short explanation

1380.92 --> 1386.65
yesterday as to what that really is it's

1383.32 --> 1390.4299999999998
basically an Iraq situation where yeah

1386.65 --> 1394.15
one CIA government is now being replaced

1390.43 --> 1397.3
by the other CIA the policy change

1394.15 --> 1398.8300000000002
basically it was very typically American

1397.3 --> 1403.93
and the same kind of thing as what

1398.83 --> 1409.3799999999999
happened in Iraq Iraq and now yeah I not

1403.93 --> 1409.38
soon after found this article

1418.179 --> 1420.8990000000001
yeah

1421.82 --> 1433.6689999999999
Trump bashing Iraq war architect Elliott

1425.539 --> 1440.57
Abrams to lead us regime change in

1433.669 --> 1442.779
Venezuela really yeah I'm gonna put that

1440.57 --> 1445.6689999999999
link outs Russia Today article yeah they

1442.779 --> 1449.779
are what they are they're not

1445.669 --> 1453.97
necessarily pro America but yeah this is

1449.779 --> 1453.97
totally ironic isn't it

1457.9 --> 1469.0500000000002
that yeah Iraq war architect leading

1465.059 --> 1473.77
regime change in Venezuela it's just I

1469.05 --> 1476.05
guess they yeah they took somebody

1473.77 --> 1477.97
that's dealt with the same type of

1476.05 --> 1481.35
situation and they're just doing it

1477.97 --> 1484.8
again just business as usual in a way

1481.35 --> 1484.8
weird isn't it

1487.83 --> 1492.72
yeah haunted house I am having people on

1490.44 --> 1494.52
my panel but nobody's coming I don't

1492.72 --> 1498.63
know why yesterday was the same issue

1494.52 --> 1502.94
people seem to have big thresholds to

1498.63 --> 1502.94
get over to get in here sometimes but

1505.67 --> 1510.0500000000002
yeah if you want to come on that's fine

1511.37 --> 1514.9099999999999
as long as you behave

1523.28 --> 1526.03
see

1527.96 --> 1530.56
but

1533.52 --> 1537.47
okay haunted house you got a link

1537.78 --> 1541.19
yeah and I noticed the

1542.61 --> 1549.6799999999998
that cool picture of the diver and yeah

1546.45 --> 1549.68
giving hands to a seal

1570.29 --> 1575.55
so yeah

1572.47 --> 1575.55
still waiting ah

1575.87 --> 1583.9699999999998
hello good morning or we can't hear you

1580.51 --> 1590.36
you can't hear me alright now I can hey

1583.97 --> 1594.2
hello how are you I'm doing good you

1590.36 --> 1598.58
grown a mustache growing and it's been

1594.2 --> 1599.99
there since before Christmas should go

1598.58 --> 1602.0
for you know there's a guy who looks a

1599.99 --> 1605.33
lot like you he's got a channel called

1602.0 --> 1618.14
Texan text effects or something like

1605.33 --> 1619.4289999999999
that he's a Portuguese I think okay or I

1618.14 --> 1621.74
don't know they speak another language

1619.429 --> 1623.1490000000001
but they're flattered and the guy is

1621.74 --> 1626.799
like you could be like your older

1623.149 --> 1629.9899999999998
brother out here

1626.799 --> 1632.96
I have doppelgangers - apparently I'm oh

1629.99 --> 1635.57
I'm related to Owen Benjamin with meets

1632.96 --> 1640.789
like weird like people have been telling

1635.57 --> 1643.1589999999999
me for years even before this even even

1640.789 --> 1647.899
doing the goth scene like yeah there's

1643.159 --> 1651.0800000000002
this other guy also Dutch and I don't I

1647.899 --> 1655.279
think he lives very near even that is

1651.08 --> 1657.3799999999999
like almost a clone of me apparently

1655.279 --> 1660.26
yet it's like and people must had been

1657.38 --> 1665.0590000000002
mistaking me for that person but I've

1660.26 --> 1666.95
never met him so weird it's like okay I

1665.059 --> 1673.1
hope that wasn't actually like a Jekyll

1666.95 --> 1675.3500000000001
and Hyde situation it was me as somebody

1673.1 --> 1676.58
else that just yeah no you look exactly

1675.35 --> 1680.029
like that other guy but you're

1676.58 --> 1683.99
completely different yeah and it turned

1680.029 --> 1685.57
out to be me I don't know it's weird

1683.99 --> 1688.7
when you do meet your doppelganger

1685.57 --> 1693.02
typically they're not like you and I've

1688.7 --> 1695.679
never met nobody but I've been hearing

1693.02 --> 1699.15
that for for for over a decade

1695.679 --> 1701.8200000000002
well not so much recently I don't know

1699.15 --> 1704.5800000000002
things have changed I don't think that

1701.82 --> 1707.79
that dumper double ganger person of me

1704.58 --> 1712.37
is very much the same it's a weird word

1707.79 --> 1717.53
doppelganger such a big [ __ ] word

1712.37 --> 1717.53
doppelganger it sounds German it is Jim

1718.7 --> 1722.46
you're dutch right

1720.36 --> 1725.4599999999998
yep dungeon my girlfriend ex-girlfriend

1722.46 --> 1728.91
say it ain't Dutch she ain't much you

1725.46 --> 1730.74
loved Amsterdam I saw a great movie from

1728.91 --> 1734.4
ah well actually now it's another lay it

1730.74 --> 1736.44
was from Norway that's not five you see

1734.4 --> 1739.02
if we in America we think well it's in

1736.44 --> 1742.6100000000001
that area something over there alright

1739.02 --> 1742.61
who's about it was about an earthquake

1742.97 --> 1747.27
kind of like one of those movies but

1744.87 --> 1748.1399999999999
they have a look a message it's weird at

1747.27 --> 1750.81
the end of the movie it's like

1748.14 --> 1752.16
earthquakes you know in Norway now there

1750.81 --> 1757.1699999999998
are fault lines all over the place

1752.16 --> 1766.0700000000002
unattended so how's your earth man still

1757.17 --> 1768.93
flat it seems so I think it should be an

1766.07 --> 1771.72
open-ended thing you know like it could

1768.93 --> 1775.53
be whatever we want it to be however we

1771.72 --> 1778.38
feel now we're in you know individual

1775.53 --> 1781.47
world view like your personal world view

1778.38 --> 1784.14
the work the way you see the world only

1781.47 --> 1786.6000000000001
you that I could never really you could

1784.14 --> 1789.51
explain it to me but there's the vision

1786.6 --> 1792.75
you have in your head I think that is

1789.51 --> 1795.51
always gonna be in flux you know

1792.75 --> 1800.07
especially now that we've been what do

1795.51 --> 1800.82
you mean my fish is actually not in flux

1800.07 --> 1803.6399999999999
at all

1800.82 --> 1805.98
but what if you saw more like what if

1803.64 --> 1809.16
you had the opportunity to travel but

1805.98 --> 1811.32
I've already seen more I just don't

1809.16 --> 1815.4
remember all of it it's just a memory of

1811.32 --> 1819.03
it all it's just gradually it's like

1815.4 --> 1822.0900000000001
been peeling a layer of that giant

1819.03 --> 1824.3999999999999
painting and it's just growing but I've

1822.09 --> 1824.99
already seen it I just couldn't handle

1824.4 --> 1827.73
it

1824.99 --> 1833.34
you believe you're born out of this

1827.73 --> 1837.3
world or into this world whether what

1833.34 --> 1840.27
that's a really odd question what do you

1837.3 --> 1842.1599999999999
mean are we born out of this world or

1840.27 --> 1843.75
into this world in other words according

1842.16 --> 1845.94
to what you just said about peeling an

1843.75 --> 1848.01
onion back we're born out of this world

1845.94 --> 1850.56
like we're a product of it so we're just

1848.01 --> 1856.23
peeling back and then at the end what's

1850.56 --> 1860.07
left is is the I don't know like the

1856.23 --> 1863.24
soul or something like that I don't know

1860.07 --> 1869.33
so you you believe we're amnesia amnesia

1863.24 --> 1869.33
and music and music yeah

1872.4 --> 1879.0
I don't know it did rippln depends on

1875.16 --> 1882.48
the functioning of the receiver and the

1879.0 --> 1884.4
ego to counter it so it's the ego that

1882.48 --> 1887.91
doesn't allow you to understand things

1884.4 --> 1892.68
because you can't handle it and it's

1887.91 --> 1895.2900000000002
yeah that's more about that I don't know

1892.68 --> 1898.43
it but I think that we're all born into

1895.29 --> 1901.8899999999999
this world and this is just our

1898.43 --> 1903.8400000000001
manifestation and I'm not sure how it

1901.89 --> 1908.25
works with the rests you know even the

1903.84 --> 1911.73
Dark Worlds I I think people can stay

1908.25 --> 1914.79
there but you're not supposed to do that

1911.73 --> 1916.2
so far it's only yeah everything from

1914.79 --> 1917.37
what I've learned and from what I've

1916.2 --> 1919.679
learned from my healer and what I've

1917.37 --> 1924.0
seen it's only the dark ones the

1919.679 --> 1927.74
dwelling wants the the ones that

1924.0 --> 1932.73
unbalance things that stay there

1927.74 --> 1936.72
because within the path it was suggested

1932.73 --> 1938.309
sort of that even if you die and go

1936.72 --> 1941.07
there to the other side

1938.309 --> 1945.8999999999999
you're then supposed to move on even

1941.07 --> 1948.059
from there to beyond and can be

1945.9 --> 1951.02
described many ways like going into the

1948.059 --> 1957.0
bright light or walking into the fire or

1951.02 --> 1961.5
just going away from there moving beyond

1957.0 --> 1964.11
and yeah how can you interpret that is

1961.5 --> 1966.98
there your realm beyond deeper through

1964.11 --> 1970.77
the dark world where heavens supposed

1966.98 --> 1976.3700000000001
supposedly is and go oh my god I think

1970.77 --> 1979.05
it's so complex because I have ideas and

1976.37 --> 1981.9899999999998
concepts but yeah since the dark world

1979.05 --> 1988.2
is mostly a reflection of our

1981.99 --> 1990.42
imaginations then if you just approach

1988.2 --> 1992.7
that conceptually then technically could

1990.42 --> 1994.98
it ever be possible to actually

1992.7 --> 1998.179
experience from within the imagination

1994.98 --> 2001.76
what it would actually be like beyond

1998.179 --> 2005.38
what do you mean by dark world that's

2001.76 --> 2008.03
where my most of my visions went through

2005.38 --> 2010.5800000000002
that that's how you experience the other

2008.03 --> 2012.92
side dark dark isn't evil or just Taoism

2010.58 --> 2016.8799999999999
without light no dark world just means

2012.92 --> 2018.92
there's no no daylight okay there's no

2016.88 --> 2022.8500000000001
image okay no there is there's

2018.92 --> 2025.67
everything but there's no for me there

2022.85 --> 2029.8999999999999
was no globe of the heavens there was no

2025.67 --> 2032.77
Sun no moon no stars nothing ever but

2029.9 --> 2032.77
there was light

2032.86 --> 2039.32
how do you know because I looked around

2036.58 --> 2041.3
like what indicates light to you but

2039.32 --> 2043.3999999999999
what is the like when you say that like

2041.3 --> 2045.56
what do you pick like street lights

2043.4 --> 2049.82
there are street lights and they would

2045.56 --> 2052.22
light things up so there was lights but

2049.82 --> 2055.76
it was always it always seemed to be

2052.22 --> 2057.3199999999997
night but without stars or anything no

2055.76 --> 2062.3100000000004
global if that happens

2057.32 --> 2064.6800000000003
and it's not like oh yeah oh please take

2062.31 --> 2067.47
a seat while you are going to enter the

2064.68 --> 2070.47
dark world now please be careful and

2067.47 --> 2072.18
look above to realize that this is not

2070.47 --> 2073.35
the actual universe now it's just like

2072.18 --> 2076.95
Boop you're there

2073.35 --> 2078.63
[ __ ] happens I'm preoccupied and then

2076.95 --> 2080.8799999999997
only later I figure out like was this

2078.63 --> 2082.86
real was this in the physical world or

2080.88 --> 2084.96
versus in the dark world wait was there

2082.86 --> 2088.5
any kind of sign of a real Sun or

2084.96 --> 2090.2400000000002
anything because if there was then it

2088.5 --> 2097.55
must have been real because you'd never

2090.24 --> 2104.0299999999997
get to see it in the dark world it's

2097.55 --> 2104.03
complicated yeah it's definitely uh

2104.57 --> 2111.03
interesting yeah I think I don't think

2108.99 --> 2113.8799999999997
we're alive I don't think we're dead I

2111.03 --> 2116.7900000000004
think we're just something in between

2113.88 --> 2120.06
I think we're experiencing a variation

2116.79 --> 2121.77
on the only thing we can do you know

2120.06 --> 2125.04
like what else is a human being gonna do

2121.77 --> 2127.38
except be you know we have eyes see and

2125.04 --> 2129.81
ears to hear and and all the rest and we

2127.38 --> 2131.37
have legs so we could walk around you

2129.81 --> 2135.48
know when you strip life down to like

2131.37 --> 2137.97
that then a creator becomes something

2135.48 --> 2140.19
that creates and this universe is a

2137.97 --> 2143.1299999999997
creating universe so it's going to keep

2140.19 --> 2148.59
going my vision is awesome creating

2143.13 --> 2153.54
transforming yeah yeah destroying yep as

2148.59 --> 2155.8500000000004
it goes exactly to between opposing

2153.54 --> 2158.87
vortices like in other words something

2155.85 --> 2158.87
in the center

2159.63 --> 2164.6400000000003
spraying outwards or think of like a

2161.7 --> 2165.97
toroidal shape something that's like a

2164.64 --> 2168.46
cycle okay

2165.97 --> 2172.1189999999997
processing inward and back outward again

2168.46 --> 2175.27
over and over again I don't think the

2172.119 --> 2177.819
wheels of time well I think it's just

2175.27 --> 2179.799
it's a perpetual thing like it's the

2177.819 --> 2182.2
only thing at all right can do is kind

2179.799 --> 2183.67
of like fold in on itself over and over

2182.2 --> 2186.93
again and like a doughnut you know like

2183.67 --> 2190.869
the animated 3d animated toroidal thing

2186.93 --> 2194.23
and depending on how you look at it I

2190.869 --> 2197.94
think it's a spiral from the top I think

2194.23 --> 2200.2
everything is spinning radially outward

2197.94 --> 2202.9900000000002
but there's no beginning there's no end

2200.2 --> 2205.39
that we're just like that's not for us

2202.99 --> 2207.4199999999996
to perceive I don't know how that would

2205.39 --> 2209.71
how you could perceive it doesn't really

2207.42 --> 2214.809
technically it doesn't work out what do

2209.71 --> 2216.67
you mean well kind of if if there was a

2214.809 --> 2220.2400000000002
start to something would there be people

2216.67 --> 2222.309
like would the Earth's would earth start

2220.24 --> 2228.4599999999996
like BAM with like a crowd of people or

2222.309 --> 2230.26
a man and a woman one person like what

2228.46 --> 2233.14
would it look like trees fauna

2230.26 --> 2237.19
everything all set up or it's the

2233.14 --> 2242.8289999999997
platform well it all depends where the

2237.19 --> 2245.829
start starts because I think that the

2242.829 --> 2248.17
the designer or the one that the the

2245.829 --> 2249.6090000000004
house decorator not the designer because

2248.17 --> 2255.7000000000003
the design is inherent but the house

2249.609 --> 2257.619
decorator one that manages us oh my god

2255.7 --> 2260.74
that could definitely that could even be

2257.619 --> 2262.9
the Dark One himself maybe that was the

2260.74 --> 2265.5989999999997
task originally designated to him and

2262.9 --> 2267.369
then things became more complicated and

2265.599 --> 2270.01
he became more interwove in and so did

2267.369 --> 2272.799
the light side that's I think it

2270.01 --> 2277.6600000000003
probably happened but I don't know the

2272.799 --> 2279.94
more I think about it maybe because just

2277.66 --> 2281.859
come walking in from the

2279.94 --> 2284.71
extra-dimensional Heaven's Gate into

2281.859 --> 2288.49
this world and then they become a part

2284.71 --> 2290.859
of it that has always been there go away

2288.49 --> 2293.3689999999997
the perspective of this realm kind of

2290.859 --> 2295.71
like us well almost Mandela effect like

2293.369 --> 2298.9
when we were born we didn't really like

2295.71 --> 2302.41
suddenly this thing was always there

2298.9 --> 2305.34
and there are some things that I

2302.41 --> 2308.6499999999996
personally have know taken note of like

2305.34 --> 2311.71
this figure here in the Bible for

2308.65 --> 2313.96
example or that they weren't there as

2311.71 --> 2317.77
far as I remember 20 years ago at all

2313.96 --> 2319.63
and I even remember people than having

2317.77 --> 2322.18
Mandela effect responses to those

2319.63 --> 2324.52
figures and being outraged like oh the

2322.18 --> 2326.0499999999997
Satanists are destroying the Bible but

2324.52 --> 2327.73
now nobody seems to remember it just

2326.05 --> 2334.48
seems to think it's a natural part of it

2327.73 --> 2337.93
I don't know why why do people what do

2334.48 --> 2341.65
people attach CERN to Mandela I mean I

2337.93 --> 2342.94
understand the concept but what's your

2341.65 --> 2346.39
theory on CERN like what do you think

2342.94 --> 2351.79
they're no they're nothing they do think

2346.39 --> 2353.71
that cern is [ __ ] sir Kuki machination

2351.79 --> 2357.0099999999998
to make us believe that they are so

2353.71 --> 2359.98
powerful wizards block [ __ ] has

2357.01 --> 2362.05
nothing to do with that it seems to me

2359.98 --> 2364.93
like if they needed it that big why not

2362.05 --> 2367.4500000000003
make it twice as big you know they got

2364.93 --> 2368.98
the land it just doesn't make sense to

2367.45 --> 2372.37
me it doesn't seem like like where are

2368.98 --> 2373.9
all the great discoveries no way why do

2372.37 --> 2375.7
we there aren't any

2373.9 --> 2378.19
what if they've been doing on the ISS

2375.7 --> 2383.7999999999997
doing science for 30 years what if they

2378.19 --> 2387.25
come with something that is now the ISS

2383.8 --> 2389.11
is this PR keeping people in check yeah

2387.25 --> 2392.74
it's not doing anything and neither is

2389.11 --> 2395.65
the the psychotron thing doesn't really

2392.74 --> 2397.8999999999996
do anything the only thing they probably

2395.65 --> 2401.4700000000003
could have learned from it was very

2397.9 --> 2404.23
short very primitive and that would

2401.47 --> 2406.4199999999996
never would never understand the value

2404.23 --> 2408.4900000000002
of what they actually did learn from it

2406.42 --> 2410.83
so they're now just giving a giant cover

2408.49 --> 2415.24
story to basically cover up for the

2410.83 --> 2418.42
massive costs that it had so I think

2415.24 --> 2421.24
yeah they probably did build it for to

2418.42 --> 2426.13
learn certain things there maybe even

2421.24 --> 2427.9599999999996
like super high-tech energy really how

2426.13 --> 2430.3
it works like how can you freaking build

2427.96 --> 2431.64
a replicator like in Star Trek well

2430.3 --> 2433.32
we'll note that you will

2431.64 --> 2435.2999999999997
to know certain fundamentals about

2433.32 --> 2438.9300000000003
energy and how that interacts they did

2435.3 --> 2440.4300000000003
that [ __ ] was very quickly over with but

2438.93 --> 2441.99
yeah they still have the massive

2440.43 --> 2446.52
building and all these bills so it is

2441.99 --> 2449.8799999999997
they just made more cover stories to to

2446.52 --> 2451.32
account for all that because it seems to

2449.88 --> 2454.62
me like every time I look into science

2451.32 --> 2458.04
or experiments or like God let's say I'm

2454.62 --> 2460.8599999999997
big in to researching but scientific

2458.04 --> 2461.85
balloon facilities it's always about

2460.86 --> 2463.5
radiation

2461.85 --> 2465.36
it's always the doing radiation

2463.5 --> 2466.68
experiments to see what you know how

2465.36 --> 2475.11
much radiation is here how much

2466.68 --> 2479.0099999999998
radiation is there the the cern thing I

2475.11 --> 2482.25
think the whole song and dance they did

2479.01 --> 2486.4500000000003
was to keep people's you know to pique

2482.25 --> 2489.06
people's curiosity about it to keep it

2486.45 --> 2492.66
it's like a press thing if I keep it

2489.06 --> 2494.5499999999997
relevant and the conspirators fell for

2492.66 --> 2496.3799999999997
it like they were like they say it just

2494.55 --> 2499.05
like that tunnel that they built over a

2496.38 --> 2501.3
night it's just dangling low key like oh

2499.05 --> 2503.28
there's something mysterious scary going

2501.3 --> 2507.27
on there's a conspiracy oh look how

2503.28 --> 2509.5400000000004
interesting whoa so you got it now it's

2507.27 --> 2512.22
your job to figure out what this means

2509.54 --> 2514.2599999999998
because it must be important otherwise

2512.22 --> 2517.56
they would have done this triggering

2514.26 --> 2519.6000000000004
people yeah these weird dancing and the

2517.56 --> 2521.52
Shiva statue and all this stuff it's

2519.6 --> 2524.97
like come on it's like they know they're

2521.52 --> 2526.32
put they know they're gonna like disturb

2524.97 --> 2529.1099999999997
certain people and bother

2526.32 --> 2531.27
it just makes it's mysterious and why

2529.11 --> 2534.81
not you know they need it triggering the

2531.27 --> 2540.66
conspiracy theorists sending them into a

2534.81 --> 2544.89
frenzy what this means in a grander

2540.66 --> 2548.2799999999997
scale of thing that's why it does throw

2544.89 --> 2551.64
33 things up there and just look at it

2548.28 --> 2555.1800000000003
ever every time some new freaky deep

2551.64 --> 2557.94
state themed Superbowl commercial comes

2555.18 --> 2560.22
out my god like it's gonna be two months

2557.94 --> 2562.51
of like hundreds of thousands of people

2560.22 --> 2565.66
making videos about

2562.51 --> 2567.46
and I know this is a pro predictive

2565.66 --> 2569.5
programming and they're gonna do this

2567.46 --> 2572.68
from the future I saw it in there and

2569.5 --> 2576.07
yeah it's when are we supposed to give a

2572.68 --> 2579.19
[ __ ] about Katy Perry and [ __ ]

2576.07 --> 2580.57
Beyonce's hand signal like they don't

2579.19 --> 2582.37
understand what the hell they're doing

2580.57 --> 2584.11
yeah but the children but the children's

2582.37 --> 2585.46
[ __ ] kids don't even pay attention to

2584.11 --> 2587.05
it you know why are people worried about

2585.46 --> 2589.0
kids apparently all the Millennials are

2587.05 --> 2592.23
[ __ ] idiots you know and that's a

2589.0 --> 2598.09
terrible way to look at the next wave of

2592.23 --> 2600.37
flat earthers or globus or whoever you

2598.09 --> 2602.11
know I don't think it's important really

2600.37 --> 2605.58
to me anymore about the shape of the

2602.11 --> 2607.63
earth whether someone's flat or round

2605.58 --> 2609.97
seems like that's just a mean - it means

2607.63 --> 2611.56
to an end you know it's not a it's not

2609.97 --> 2614.3199999999997
really important what someone believes

2611.56 --> 2616.45
in but why they believe in it you know

2614.32 --> 2619.1800000000003
like life is about the journey it's

2616.45 --> 2623.5299999999997
about the middle the middle but the

2619.18 --> 2628.4199999999996
fulcrum the center it's the part left

2623.53 --> 2630.01
out by science science left science took

2628.42 --> 2632.35
God out of the equation so they took

2630.01 --> 2634.48
causality Adam they took cause out of

2632.35 --> 2637.5699999999997
cause now science did not

2634.48 --> 2639.7
that's scientism that's the other

2637.57 --> 2642.25
religion you can't call that science

2639.7 --> 2644.74
really science is just a method

2642.25 --> 2647.08
well I still look at science still won't

2644.74 --> 2650.9199999999996
go to that start science still won't go

2647.08 --> 2654.04
there science is not sentient okay

2650.92 --> 2658.7200000000003
science is a method and it's the people

2654.04 --> 2662.65
that applied or miss apply it the

2658.72 --> 2664.72
biosigns the spirit of science the think

2662.65 --> 2670.9300000000003
it apart or all religious that's all

2664.72 --> 2673.0899999999997
religious iconography but still they're

2670.93 --> 2675.94
trained not to go and not to approach

2673.09 --> 2679.09
cause a different cause and effect

2675.94 --> 2681.73
whereas to most to mainstream science

2679.09 --> 2684.1600000000003
but fortunately it's the effect is the

2681.73 --> 2686.53
cause you know cuz it's a question

2684.16 --> 2688.18
that's that leaves you pondering it

2686.53 --> 2691.7200000000003
leaves you thinking and wondering and

2688.18 --> 2693.23
that's not that's that doesn't work for

2691.72 --> 2695.99
the other side

2693.23 --> 2697.4
you know anybody in power I think we

2695.99 --> 2700.64
need to shy away from saying elites

2697.4 --> 2704.119
these elite people you know you're the

2700.64 --> 2706.0099999999998
elite [ __ ] no I'm the elite no but

2704.119 --> 2709.549
it's not about elite it's about being a

2706.01 --> 2711.9500000000003
controller or not well I'm the

2709.549 --> 2714.71
controller well no you're not you're

2711.95 --> 2716.839
older of your mind of your situation but

2714.71 --> 2721.52
how much do you control are there people

2716.839 --> 2723.29
actually doing what you say because then

2721.52 --> 2725.15
you have some kind of control you can

2723.29 --> 2729.68
have control through money you can have

2725.15 --> 2732.65
control through social exam being

2729.68 --> 2735.5299999999997
socially exemplary or any more powerful

2732.65 --> 2738.6800000000003
there's all kinds of pound fluence yeah

2735.53 --> 2740.75
influence an influence can come from

2738.68 --> 2744.2
anybody you know I mean look at Kyrie

2740.75 --> 2748.299
Irving the guys said the earth was flat

2744.2 --> 2750.2599999999998
and like kids all over the country are

2748.299 --> 2752.24
teachers all over the country are now

2750.26 --> 2755.21
finding it difficult to teach the globe

2752.24 --> 2756.14
in class because of what he said I don't

2755.21 --> 2757.64
know if that's a good thing or a bad

2756.14 --> 2760.49
thing I mean yeah it's kind of a good

2757.64 --> 2764.5099999999998
thing but I don't like the idea of kids

2760.49 --> 2767.18
just I don't know maybe I'm reading into

2764.51 --> 2769.25
it too much like two kids you know kind

2767.18 --> 2771.5
of hanging on what a basketball player

2769.25 --> 2773.54
said you know people needs to think for

2771.5 --> 2776.2
themselves if some if someone thinks for

2773.54 --> 2778.3089999999997
themselves and comes to the conclusion

2776.2 --> 2782.1499999999996
that the earth is a sphere

2778.309 --> 2784.4
I'd rather his hear his story than the

2782.15 --> 2787.4
guy who says it's flat because somebody

2784.4 --> 2789.77
told him to say or he doesn't know why

2787.4 --> 2793.339
you know no but they're doing it because

2789.77 --> 2795.559
it's rebellious because they can see the

2793.339 --> 2797.599
religious aspect of the globe teaching

2795.559 --> 2799.309
now there's a feel for this too many

2797.599 --> 2799.94
people have talked about it it's become

2799.309 --> 2803.9
a thing

2799.94 --> 2806.2400000000002
subconsciously at least but yeah of

2803.9 --> 2808.369
course if somebody just steps up like

2806.24 --> 2811.49
you're her screw the globe Flat Earth

2808.369 --> 2814.369
and do it pretty in public then yeah

2811.49 --> 2816.52
that's gonna give it quite a rush to

2814.369 --> 2819.23
some of these more rebellious teenagers

2816.52 --> 2821.479
whatever to think like oh yeah I'm a

2819.23 --> 2823.859
fighter - now you know

2821.479 --> 2825.8999999999996
because I'll take that challenge I know

2823.859 --> 2829.2
what that the world's gonna get a little

2825.9 --> 2831.63
ruckus top over it and I'm ready to get

2829.2 --> 2835.859
some muscles flexing I won the challenge

2831.63 --> 2837.779
I don't want to be this easy go along

2835.859 --> 2842.19
with the railroad to the narrative

2837.779 --> 2845.88
[ __ ] it's a spirit did you ever work

2842.19 --> 2848.369
out Arwen yeah do you ever work out do

2845.88 --> 2852.299
you ever want to gain muscle not

2848.369 --> 2856.38
necessarily okay I do some moments so if

2852.299 --> 2857.91
you're like frame or physique and he

2856.38 --> 2860.219
found it really difficult to gain muscle

2857.91 --> 2866.7
I was like thinking about taking

2860.219 --> 2870.089
steroids okay so bad don't stupid what

2866.7 --> 2871.64
is muscle what do you need it for well

2870.089 --> 2875.549
sometimes it's good to have for

2871.64 --> 2880.109
self-defense or for job really muscle or

2875.549 --> 2880.529
look for self-defense absolutely no it's

2880.109 --> 2885.119
not

2880.529 --> 2888.299
I'd rather be well it's not what do you

2885.119 --> 2892.349
mean it isn't how is having more muscle

2888.299 --> 2898.14
good for self-defense because perhaps

2892.349 --> 2900.299
you can avoid the interaction from the

2898.14 --> 2902.91
get-go if someone sees you it's

2900.299 --> 2906.93
someone's intimidated by you they may be

2902.91 --> 2910.109
they may not be so what you need muscles

2906.93 --> 2911.7889999999998
to intimidate somebody well in the

2910.109 --> 2915.749
situation maybe you don't see them and

2911.789 --> 2917.46
to get girls exactly well I don't need

2915.749 --> 2920.5789999999997
muscles to intimidate anyone

2917.46 --> 2922.979
I just need words and need to look them

2920.579 --> 2926.219
straight in the eye and show them yet

2922.979 --> 2928.319
you can't handle this it feels good

2926.219 --> 2930.4790000000003
though feels it's actually like

2928.319 --> 2934.43
physically feels good that's true yeah

2930.479 --> 2938.43
of course it's physical exercise always

2934.43 --> 2938.95
gratifying but yeah building muscle you

2938.43 --> 2941.049
know like

2938.95 --> 2943.74
reading muscle the conception that

2941.049 --> 2946.03
that's gonna help you in self-defense

2943.74 --> 2949.299
it's just a misconception because

2946.03 --> 2952.2400000000002
actually growing muscle just makes you

2949.299 --> 2956.44
slower and makes you need more

2952.24 --> 2958.4799999999996
maintenance to sustain that it doesn't

2956.44 --> 2960.76
work what you need is speed and

2958.48 --> 2964.329
quickness of mind and quickness of

2960.76 --> 2967.48
reflex and to see things coming ahead of

2964.329 --> 2969.819
time that's that's okay your self

2967.48 --> 2971.47
defense but you need to be able to throw

2969.819 --> 2973.42
a punch that means something you know

2971.47 --> 2976.5989999999997
the right spot and I believe me I'm not

2973.42 --> 2978.76
CEO and all beat strong to give a good

2976.599 --> 2981.369
punch you just need to be able to focus

2978.76 --> 2983.3390000000004
your energy properly that's true you

2981.369 --> 2986.38
know what it does look at all these

2983.339 --> 2989.589
Shaolin monks and all the priests over

2986.38 --> 2992.77
there they like bulky shady people know

2989.589 --> 2998.29
they're slim and they just focus and

2992.77 --> 3001.4
it's like bank robbers well it's open

2998.29 --> 3004.349
okay that's not because of muscle I

3001.4 --> 3008.059
understand that but would you rather be

3004.349 --> 3011.069
with or without I were out or be without

3008.059 --> 3014.13
because it's rubber I don't need as much

3011.069 --> 3017.2799999999997
food and I feel perfectly fine you know

3014.13 --> 3019.109
I'm not at a a war you know if

3017.28 --> 3021.0
everything if you're gonna be in a

3019.109 --> 3024.0589999999997
battle permanently and there's gonna be

3021.0 --> 3026.43
constant loot then yeah being mostly

3024.059 --> 3027.8390000000004
will give you less strain on your

3026.43 --> 3029.7
skeleton because you're gonna be

3027.839 --> 3031.5299999999997
carrying heavy guns and [ __ ] and gonna

3029.7 --> 3034.74
move camp all the time yeah it's very

3031.53 --> 3037.92
useful in that scenario but as long as

3034.74 --> 3040.319
that scenario is not there it's just in

3037.92 --> 3042.299
the way well yeah you could use it as

3040.319 --> 3043.29
like oh look at this I'm so mostly

3042.299 --> 3045.569
uneasy

3043.29 --> 3048.0
typically you're talking about you'd

3045.569 --> 3050.46
have to be gigantic you know I'm just

3048.0 --> 3058.17
saying like you know being naturally

3050.46 --> 3060.119
like having some meat on your bones on

3058.17 --> 3063.119
your weight being totally doesn't gimme

3060.119 --> 3066.809
and having nothing that's not good being

3063.119 --> 3069.359
a total soy boy is not good but with soy

3066.809 --> 3071.01
boys yeah that's what happened it's no

3069.359 --> 3071.98
but that's what happens that's what the

3071.01 --> 3074.8300000000004
soy influence

3071.98 --> 3076.98
thus it degrades your natural hormones

3074.83 --> 3080.83
that build muscle it's an anti

3076.98 --> 3083.5
testosterone that's why that's why they

3080.83 --> 3086.19
all turn into freaky little goblins

3083.5 --> 3092.89
skinny little goblins it's the soy

3086.19 --> 3094.54
that's what it does no one's flowers the

3092.89 --> 3097.45
King Jonathan I was thinking your arms

3094.54 --> 3100.3
are a bit on the thin side earlier man I

3097.45 --> 3104.2599999999998
was thin once and [ __ ] but I looked I

3100.3 --> 3108.04
look like a lollipop head like scary you

3104.26 --> 3110.44
know like I look like palsy kind of thin

3108.04 --> 3119.68
it was ugly it was only for like a month

3110.44 --> 3129.94
or two how much you weigh on let me

3119.68 --> 3131.71
guess my weight 144 no way no way the

3129.94 --> 3134.83
last time I weighed anything near that

3131.71 --> 3137.2
is at least 15 years ago and it was kind

3134.83 --> 3140.74
of chubby no I'm not a big guy and I

3137.2 --> 3143.52
don't weigh a lot whatever

3140.74 --> 3143.52
127

3145.83 --> 3149.97
might be somewhere in that direct I

3148.41 --> 3157.6099999999997
don't know I haven't stepped on a skill

3149.97 --> 3160.81
in years you know I've been the same

3157.61 --> 3160.81
like never-ending

3161.02 --> 3167.73
you ever take martial-arts I have in the

3164.619 --> 3171.28
past very long jump which one Taekwondo

3167.73 --> 3173.23
is it master anything Tai Chi is great

3171.28 --> 3176.17
which is not really martial art but it's

3173.23 --> 3178.869
kind of a discipline it is like slowly

3176.17 --> 3181.839
like playing drums it's harder to play

3178.869 --> 3184.96
slow because you have to keep all the

3181.839 --> 3188.589
time in between in your head all right

3184.96 --> 3190.63
but moving all these movements once you

3188.589 --> 3192.94
want to go to like fast speed it's all

3190.63 --> 3195.4900000000002
there for you you know one thing I

3192.94 --> 3198.4500000000003
learned playing what learning drone was

3195.49 --> 3201.25
if I can't visualize myself doing

3198.45 --> 3203.71
something like playing the beat if I

3201.25 --> 3206.109
can't see myself doing it I couldn't do

3203.71 --> 3208.54
it right you have to have a dream to

3206.109 --> 3211.0589999999997
carry you through right it's got to be

3208.54 --> 3212.77
it's got to be laid out my something has

3211.059 --> 3217.329
to tell my head that this is what's

3212.77 --> 3220.5099999999998
gonna happen right you have to have I

3217.329 --> 3223.03
have a guiding vision I have theories on

3220.51 --> 3225.309
the zone though like in terms of when

3223.03 --> 3227.44
we're let's say staring at something and

3225.309 --> 3228.8190000000004
you don't realize you're staring and

3227.44 --> 3230.859
when you pop out of it you like you

3228.819 --> 3234.22
where were you for those pests I don't

3230.859 --> 3236.95
know five or ten seconds in your

3234.22 --> 3239.6189999999997
imagination in the right world right for

3236.95 --> 3241.8999999999996
you in a less literal fashion but you

3239.619 --> 3245.02
had your eyes open and you were looking

3241.9 --> 3246.46
forward but you weren't aware of the

3245.02 --> 3249.0099999999998
things around you no but you're not

3246.46 --> 3251.619
looking through your optical input at

3249.01 --> 3253.349
that time it's all you're just it's like

3251.619 --> 3257.5
yeah you have a screen in front of you

3253.349 --> 3260.23
but you can look there and not see the

3257.5 --> 3264.119
screen even though it's on same goes for

3260.23 --> 3264.119
your attention with your with your eyes

3266.27 --> 3274.16
I think there's something to be said

3271.369 --> 3276.83
about that place it's like we don't get

3274.16 --> 3282.56
to really experience it we can only

3276.83 --> 3286.4
experience the aftermath you know like

3282.56 --> 3288.2599999999998
um let's say you're playing a song or

3286.4 --> 3291.7400000000002
something like that on guitar or drums

3288.26 --> 3295.0400000000004
or whatever you're not even you're just

3291.74 --> 3296.72
so caught up in the moment I think it's

3295.04 --> 3299.15
it's it's you're producing it for

3296.72 --> 3300.7099999999996
someone else because that does truly

3299.15 --> 3302.57
bring the best out of you it's hard it's

3300.71 --> 3305.29
a hard place to get to takes a lot of

3302.57 --> 3308.06
discipline to allow yourself to be free

3305.29 --> 3312.38
to actually like be taken over by

3308.06 --> 3314.18
something but you don't really get to

3312.38 --> 3317.48
actually experience it in the moment you

3314.18 --> 3320.27
may have fleeting glimpses but I have a

3317.48 --> 3324.23
feeling that it has something to do with

3320.27 --> 3329.21
dreams I don't know

3324.23 --> 3331.64
look yeah you could say okay the Angels

3329.21 --> 3335.21
can guide you through something heavy

3331.64 --> 3337.4
especially when you're tense but is that

3335.21 --> 3340.04
the angels or is that just another side

3337.4 --> 3344.54
of you that specifically works for that

3340.04 --> 3348.619
and only for that like a condensed glory

3344.54 --> 3350.72
version of you that suddenly starts to

3348.619 --> 3356.08
manifest in such a moment the greater

3350.72 --> 3356.08
you the superego call it

3359.88 --> 3365.819
that yeah because people have glorious

3362.64 --> 3368.8089999999997
things within them but they have to they

3365.819 --> 3371.999
have to make that move they have to

3368.809 --> 3378.539
overcome the fear that stops that from

3371.999 --> 3380.269
manifesting into a physical reality not

3378.539 --> 3384.6800000000003
bad

3380.269 --> 3384.68
yeah you definitely bulkier than me

3386.82 --> 3393.51
got a good trainer East Mahal scheme

3390.3 --> 3396.42
Andale he yells at me come on [ __ ] do

3393.51 --> 3400.8
it nice lady please that won't make a

3396.42 --> 3403.02
great drill sergeant he would be like if

3400.8 --> 3406.53
he was a street fighter in the video

3403.02 --> 3411.75
game he'd probably be like guile in the

3406.53 --> 3415.619
army guy yeah apparently he's uh gone

3411.75 --> 3418.74
into some come to blows with a few

3415.619 --> 3422.13
people I try not to get into fights no

3418.74 --> 3424.89
[ __ ] but you gets too easy to kill

3422.13 --> 3428.34
someone I mean she have one shot to like

3424.89 --> 3429.48
this area it's like now you're in jail

3428.34 --> 3431.34
for the rest of their life man that's

3429.48 --> 3433.92
the one fear I just I don't want to go

3431.34 --> 3436.4100000000003
to jail man then come on know what

3433.92 --> 3440.04
you're doing in such a time no your

3436.41 --> 3443.0699999999997
power know that you can't yeah if you

3440.04 --> 3444.93
know anything we'll take it out easy but

3443.07 --> 3446.94
be very dangerous then don't be

3444.93 --> 3449.0099999999998
short-sighted take the risk of not

3446.94 --> 3452.609
taking them out straight with such a

3449.01 --> 3454.8
move and just keep it keep it into a

3452.609 --> 3456.869
brawl that you're just more in control

3454.8 --> 3459.21
of because you are have so much more

3456.869 --> 3461.4300000000003
techniques and strength if you do that

3459.21 --> 3463.4
then yeah you can get into scuffles

3461.43 --> 3468.359
without actually ending up in jail

3463.4 --> 3470.88
you just outsmart them just like the

3468.359 --> 3473.869
Jackie Chan [ __ ] it's like yeah you can

3470.88 --> 3475.92
try to brawl with me but how does and

3473.869 --> 3480.1400000000003
you can't catch me

3475.92 --> 3483.119
oh yeah I try to look at it as like the

3480.14 --> 3487.08
the smarter guy walks away from the

3483.119 --> 3490.4100000000003
situation until he's got no other choice

3487.08 --> 3492.0299999999997
but to do something about it yeah you

3490.41 --> 3498.5699999999997
know the last time I had an altercation

3492.03 --> 3501.27
was a was a guy who he had a dog inside

3498.57 --> 3503.82
of his car and it's a [ __ ] [ __ ]

3501.27 --> 3505.8
and he left the dog in the car it was a

3503.82 --> 3507.7200000000003
puppy and the dog the car was filled

3505.8 --> 3510.0600000000004
with garbage and [ __ ] was like [ __ ]

3507.72 --> 3514.41
like one of these hoarder types and he

3510.06 --> 3517.39
had a string as the the as the door

3514.41 --> 3521.71
handle and he opened up the door and I

3517.39 --> 3525.04
like that's cool dog you uh you owe me

3521.71 --> 3526.6
that are you going inside it's like give

3525.04 --> 3527.38
me some attitude like none of your

3526.6 --> 3531.7
[ __ ] business

3527.38 --> 3534.55
this is a nasty-looking dude [ __ ] and

3531.7 --> 3536.08
then he moved this car like he got he

3534.55 --> 3538.48
was like halfway out of it and pulled

3536.08 --> 3538.96
back as if he was gonna hit me with the

3538.48 --> 3541.18
door

3538.96 --> 3543.04
so I've never kicked someone's car

3541.18 --> 3545.02
before you know I work on cars I could

3543.04 --> 3546.7
never do that but yeah [ __ ] put my

3545.02 --> 3549.55
foot into the side of his door and it

3546.7 --> 3554.5299999999997
was dented and I was like it's what

3549.55 --> 3557.11
fight-or-flight response and he like

3554.53 --> 3559.3
almost hit me he almost ran like ran

3557.11 --> 3560.83
into me then he parked his car and I was

3559.3 --> 3562.6600000000003
like calm down okay calm down

3560.83 --> 3565.87
and he went into the store okay this is

3562.66 --> 3568.81
a cool store in Paramus New Jersey and

3565.87 --> 3571.18
the owner of the store is a Xbox or his

3568.81 --> 3573.16
brother is a like professional weight

3571.18 --> 3578.5899999999997
lifter like one of those guys just like

3573.16 --> 3580.39
that and he's this guy's in there and he

3578.59 --> 3583.84
saw me standing but standing behind him

3580.39 --> 3585.43
and I was like like what the [ __ ] is

3583.84 --> 3586.9900000000002
your probably look are you gonna do

3585.43 --> 3589.06
about it and I just flipped out and I

3586.99 --> 3591.79
grabbed him and I threw him like he was

3589.06 --> 3593.62
a lot smaller than me to like throw him

3591.79 --> 3596.86
against the door you're like this two

3599.53 --> 3605.1400000000003
bounced off this like glass door all the

3602.32 --> 3607.78
[ __ ] fell off and I was like guys take

3605.14 --> 3613.12
it outside like it was a normal

3607.78 --> 3615.2200000000003
situation and the dude like he's just

3613.12 --> 3618.67
look on his face was like you know he

3615.22 --> 3620.79
went there I was like holy [ __ ] I had no

3618.67 --> 3623.53
idea that that was gonna come out of me

3620.79 --> 3627.0099999999998
but it was just like a low-life piece of

3623.53 --> 3629.8
[ __ ] he was really looking to get a

3627.01 --> 3634.75
beating sounds by the sound of it

3629.8 --> 3636.9100000000003
somebody did just yeah one of the guys

3634.75 --> 3639.99
he one of those guys was like does it

3636.91 --> 3643.75
stop when he shakes to nudge the bully

3639.99 --> 3645.2799999999997
just enough so he can run away and then

3643.75 --> 3646.849
that one day he gets caught and then

3645.28 --> 3649.6400000000003
[ __ ] hits the fan

3646.849 --> 3652.369
oh yeah I wasn't proud of myself but in

3649.64 --> 3654.979
a way I was like I'll see that again

3652.369 --> 3657.199
sure you know no problem it's just and

3654.979 --> 3658.6989999999996
another dog situation I felt embarrassed

3657.199 --> 3660.109
though to the owner I told him I was

3658.699 --> 3664.569
like sorry about that the other day he's

3660.109 --> 3668.029
like don't worry about it it happens and

3664.569 --> 3671.15
this was a situation in a diner I went

3668.029 --> 3673.249
outside back to my car and this like 40

3671.15 --> 3675.4390000000003
50 pound dog was like a mutt looked like

3673.249 --> 3678.41

3675.439 --> 3682.249
degrees in the back of a really dirty

3678.41 --> 3684.859

3690.709 --> 3697.0389999999998
shivering so but I opened up the door

3694.039 --> 3698.779

3790.67 --> 3793.67
hand because I'm sitting in the car and

all of a sudden he went from I

3832.19 --> 3835.369

3833.18 --> 3840.56
hey listen I appreciate you caring for

3835.369 --> 3842.33

3840.56 --> 3846.17
guy gave the manager a bunch of [ __ ] -

3842.33 --> 3848.81
and it was getting there where I was

3846.17 --> 3851.1800000000003
like this you know this is gonna turn

3848.81 --> 3854.089
into something and it was one of those

3851.18 --> 3855.859
like how much of a [ __ ] idiot do I

3854.089 --> 3859.7599999999998
sound like right now I can't [ __ ] you

3855.859 --> 3863.15
[ __ ] you [ __ ] would you say what you

3859.76 --> 3866.78
say one of those and I was driving away

3863.15 --> 3871.339
he's like yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] I was like

3866.78 --> 3873.9500000000003
man that's what it's come down to and

3871.339 --> 3876.32
it's just like where do you go with that

3873.95 --> 3878.1189999999997
I don't know what the point of the story

3876.32 --> 3880.88
was but people are [ __ ] [ __ ]

3878.119 --> 3882.92
sometimes it's still worth it though

3880.88 --> 3886.46
it's still worth telling the world the

3882.92 --> 3890.3
earth is flat though Yeah right you know

3886.46 --> 3893.7200000000003
but they're not all sheeples plenty of

3890.3 --> 3898.48
sheeples but not all yeah there's just

3893.72 --> 3902.06
also a sizable amount of people that are

3898.48 --> 3906.5
just choose to be dicks

3902.06 --> 3910.4
it's true yes that's true unfortunately

3906.5 --> 3914.18
but yeah the happy story yeah man I hate

3910.4 --> 3916.88
that [ __ ] now in my mind I'm like having

3914.18 --> 3918.68
he's like woo yeah if he'd done

3916.88 --> 3920.36
something like that to me and I probably

3918.68 --> 3923.4199999999996
never would ever do this but I would

3920.36 --> 3926.21
always think it it's like okay just get

3923.42 --> 3928.9700000000003
that dog and then just push that car

3926.21 --> 3935.0
into into the water or something

3928.97 --> 3937.1899999999996
I have a knife that it's a great knife

3935.0 --> 3943.34
it's a great knife yeah

3937.19 --> 3944.93
Kershaw and just in case you know just

3943.34 --> 3947.57
in case because you never know imagine

3944.93 --> 3950.1499999999996
like imagine like people wearing they're

3947.57 --> 3952.31
coming after you you know like like the

3950.15 --> 3954.65
threats were real you know I kept the

3952.31 --> 3957.14
people involved in conspiracy circles

3954.65 --> 3959.39
are really paranoid but I don't think

3957.14 --> 3961.94
they truly believe that people are

3959.39 --> 3963.95
coming after them but it would be very

3961.94 --> 3966.89
easy you know there's plenty of times

3963.95 --> 3969.0499999999997
I'm out walking my dog any card can just

3966.89 --> 3974.5
screech pull up right next to me throw

3969.05 --> 3974.5
me in the back maybe

3974.559 --> 3981.949
or something like that you know you

3976.789 --> 3983.6600000000003
never yeah but look I am plenty of

3981.949 --> 3988.089
paranoid when it comes to that kind of

3983.66 --> 3993.819
thing but yeah to carry around a knife

3988.089 --> 3996.259
it's just too inconvenient really and

3993.819 --> 3999.109
there's so much that can go wrong with

3996.259 --> 4001.109
it - just for raw I told I told the

3999.109 --> 4003.4
Platonic missing I'm an electrician

4198.23 --> 4206.03
local here down are very open-minded so

4200.78 --> 4207.5599999999995
that's they'll accept anything hey

4206.03 --> 4211.099999999999
everybody the earth is flat yeah we know

4207.56 --> 4214.160000000001
ready no but you know did it's more like

4211.1 --> 4216.860000000001
not we know but yeah we heard about it

4214.16 --> 4218.63
oh it's a new thing and then they'll

4216.86 --> 4219.42
take it of course but that's gonna be

4218.63 --> 4222.75
the response

4219.42 --> 4224.6990000000005
guarantee you they're all hyper liberal

4222.75 --> 4228.81
so they know everything that's out there

4224.699 --> 4231.78
basically including flatters I bet you

4228.81 --> 4233.46
many of them have just glanced on it

4231.78 --> 4238.53
like yeah that's that's out there now

4233.46 --> 4240.36
and what if you are if someone said you

4238.53 --> 4243.57
got to drop the flatter thing for a week

4240.36 --> 4247.92
a month I'll give you a couple give me

4243.57 --> 4249.63
200 bucks that's not enough absolutely

4247.92 --> 4251.4
I'm getting some good ideas here I'm

4249.63 --> 4254.31
gonna try this no that's gonna be a

4251.4 --> 4256.139999999999
minimum of $50 a day for that because

4254.31 --> 4258.4490000000005
that's a real it's not easy

4256.14 --> 4261.3
okay to keep it out and I also have to

4258.449 --> 4266.19
then push other people from bringing it

4261.3 --> 4268.17
up but yeah it's not to be fair look in

4266.19 --> 4272.04
the end with what I deal with flatter it

4268.17 --> 4275.46
is just this maybe like one twentieth of

4272.04 --> 4277.64
the total thing and yeah you can talk

4275.46 --> 4280.59
about Flat Earth forever

4277.64 --> 4282.679
point at every single relation without

4280.59 --> 4285.09
actually talking about Flat Earth so

4537.02 --> 4539.570000000001
blocked

4537.62 --> 4543.41
you can't live stream there so it's like

Flat Earth debate and has only a few

4543.41 --> 4551.54
subs and I'll put the link out in chat

4551.54 --> 4556.28
have like 650 or something I don't

4554.57 --> 4560.21
believe I don't believe in showing the

4556.28 --> 4563.469
sub count I want people to I don't you

4560.21 --> 4568.55
choose my channel over the merits of my

4563.469 --> 4570.71
videos videos I get it but I'm gonna

4568.55 --> 4573.650000000001
make a video one of these days that's

4570.71 --> 4575.09
fine but yeah I'm not showing it I'm

4573.65 --> 4578.449
showing it for a good reason

4575.09 --> 4581.6
it's because it's a thing because like I

4578.449 --> 4583.669999999999
had seriously fluctuating subscriber

4581.6 --> 4587.63
moans like it felt like I was being

4583.67 --> 4589.85
actively artificially unsubscribe people

4587.63 --> 4592.969
that were supposedly subscribed just got

4589.85 --> 4594.26
unsubscribe without them knowing and

4592.969 --> 4596.969
that [ __ ] happens so that's why I'm

4594.26 --> 4599.64
showing it to give a live update

4596.969 --> 4601.65
of when it's fluctuating because it is a

4599.64 --> 4609.42
thing I've talked about it many times

4601.65 --> 4611.129999999999
see words now not still 2025 so but it's

4609.42 --> 4613.469
been all over the place like especially

4611.13 --> 4618.4490000000005

4618.449 --> 4623.61
down and again up and he went totally

4715.98 --> 4722.789
like

4717.65 --> 4726.058999999999
takes you by the barrels path of Christ

4722.789 --> 4730.409
that you so here's my thing against a

4726.059 --> 4733.53
flat smacking people shouldn't film flat

4730.409 --> 4739.219
smacking it's disingenuous and it takes

4733.53 --> 4739.219
you out of the moment go go

4744.76 --> 4749.92
it is kind of in place if I agree but it

4748.82 --> 4752.75
is what it is

4749.92 --> 4755.57
what I would do I wouldn't live stream

4752.75 --> 4757.61
it I wouldn't eat it is will dude shut

4755.57 --> 4759.799999999999
up for a moment but it is shut up for a

4757.61 --> 4762.799999999999
moment I'm talking I'm talking anything

4759.8 --> 4766.070000000001
I am talking now okay my freaking show

4762.8 --> 4768.02
I'm talking now this is how I see it

4766.07 --> 4770.9
you're gonna flex right somebody you

4768.02 --> 4774.92
wanted recorded sure recorded but then

4770.9 --> 4777.23
after don't livestream it record it and

4774.92 --> 4780.32
then afterward it's like hey are you

4777.23 --> 4783.169999999999
okay if I put this out and if they say

4780.32 --> 4785.99
yes then it's proper because yeah it's

4783.17 --> 4788.0
very sensitive and you expose people by

4785.99 --> 4789.86
asking these questions they're very

4788.0 --> 4792.67
personal inner feelings and can be

4789.86 --> 4795.41
damaging if you just throw it out there

4792.67 --> 4798.41
with that without realizing what it does

4795.41 --> 4802.4
to an individual so you ever realize

4798.41 --> 4803.72
don't lie stream it record issues you

4802.4 --> 4806.45
didn't realize you might have some anger

4803.72 --> 4808.52
issues well I hate it when I don't get

4806.45 --> 4810.98
to finish my point especially on my own

4808.52 --> 4813.5
show and have a very low tolerance for

4810.98 --> 4815.48
that kind of thing yeah I mean but

4813.5 --> 4817.85
what's really gonna come bout of it

4815.48 --> 4819.799999999999
well what's gonna come about is that my

4817.85 --> 4822.64
flow breaking especially if I'm trying

4819.8 --> 4825.53
to make a really serious and good point

4822.64 --> 4828.38
and you do this all the time but you

4825.53 --> 4831.009999999999
said it is what it is it's like one of

4828.38 --> 4835.6900000000005
those non sequitur statements that like

4831.01 --> 4835.6900000000005
it is what it is what else could it be

4836.5 --> 4841.55
yeah but isn't it what it is then it's

4839.81 --> 4844.85
not good man it's not good

4841.55 --> 4847.22
my sense what is not going on it what is

4844.85 --> 4848.42
the fact that you have anger issues you

4847.22 --> 4850.7300000000005
know that means you need to come to

4848.42 --> 4853.9
terms thank you for your concern I'll

4850.73 --> 4853.9
deal with it myself

4854.11 --> 4859.49
do you mean that thang yeah I know I

4857.54 --> 4861.92
know I have angry I Know Who I am I'm

4859.49 --> 4864.32
not a freaking wussy social justice

4861.92 --> 4867.35
warrior that has no dark side I know if

4864.32 --> 4870.2
a dark side and it's there and explained

4867.35 --> 4871.85
to you why it came that is if I'm in the

4870.2 --> 4875.179999999999
middle of an explanation and you try to

4871.85 --> 4878.120000000001
interrupt me on my own show and you do

4875.18 --> 4878.81
it more than once you're lucky that I

4878.12 --> 4880.9
didn't

4878.81 --> 4883.81
right kick out you you out of the show

4880.9 --> 4885.889999999999
so don't do that ever

4883.81 --> 4886.72
we don't think they all right little

4885.89 --> 4891.77
severe

4886.72 --> 4894.68
yeah no it's called resolute yeah you

4891.77 --> 4896.27
see it's not always intentional I don't

4894.68 --> 4898.04
know it doesn't matter if it's you know

4896.27 --> 4899.18
it should be like accidental like

4898.04 --> 4901.73
someone doesn't know that you're about

4899.18 --> 4904.58
to speak so they speak and you jump down

4901.73 --> 4906.2
their throat right I why are you people

4904.58 --> 4909.23
gonna pee Pilar gonna view you your

4906.2 --> 4911.99
livestream to see the spectacle they're

4909.23 --> 4914.24
gonna wait for it right and they're

4911.99 --> 4915.44
gonna provoke it that's not good that

4914.24 --> 4917.75
means no matter what you say how

4915.44 --> 4919.669999999999
interesting it might be no one's gonna

4917.75 --> 4920.72
pay attention cuz they're gonna it's

4919.67 --> 4923.18
gonna be hard for them to get don't

4920.72 --> 4926.96
expect anyone to pay attention I expect

4923.18 --> 4932.62
everyone to watch my show and just don't

4926.96 --> 4936.47
get it doesn't matter does not matter I

4932.62 --> 4940.3099999999995
will do what I do the way I do it as I

4936.47 --> 4943.43
see it you don't have any expectation

4940.31 --> 4947.18
you don't have any like intent behind

4943.43 --> 4951.77
what you're doing of course it's all

4947.18 --> 4955.070000000001
intent all of it it's all methodology

4951.77 --> 4957.02
saw principle it's all the path but it's

4955.07 --> 4961.25
wasted intent if you expect no one to

4957.02 --> 4962.93
understand you that's not relevant yeah

4961.25 --> 4966.35
but you're making it you're you're

4962.93 --> 4968.54
saying something knowing good and well

4966.35 --> 4969.740000000001
that the eve well aware that no one's

4968.54 --> 4972.17
gonna understand you but you're still

4969.74 --> 4974.2699999999995
going about saying well maybe not at the

4972.17 --> 4977.27
time when I'm saying it but they will or

4974.27 --> 4978.92
they might eventually that's kind of

4977.27 --> 4981.320000000001
self-destructive isn't no no it's not

4978.92 --> 4985.09
it's just how real wisdom sets in it

4981.32 --> 4988.09
takes time to who everyone all humans

4985.09 --> 4988.09
everyone

4990.66 --> 5002.7699999999995
this wisdoms gonna set in because but

4998.16 --> 5004.79
what are you bringing to the table meat

5002.77 --> 5006.47
right and that's what I was talking

5004.79 --> 5008.66
about before if you're if you're

5006.47 --> 5010.280000000001
bringing you to the table then your ball

5008.66 --> 5012.0199999999995
of anger you bringing the ball of anger

5010.28 --> 5014.63
to the table I mean you gotta clear that

5012.02 --> 5017.900000000001
why are you being so why are you

5014.63 --> 5020.78
lighting that up why I'm a ball because

5017.9 --> 5023.24
I'm because I'm sensitive all right so

5020.78 --> 5026.24
it's you're sensitive it's not my ball

5023.24 --> 5028.219999999999
of anger it's just you over emphasizing

5026.24 --> 5030.219999999999
because you are blinded by your over

5028.22 --> 5032.6
sensitivity in this specific scenario

5030.22 --> 5035.780000000001
it's not with being a ball of anger

5032.6 --> 5038.120000000001
that's you being oversensitive no one

5035.78 --> 5040.58
really talks to me like that I'm sorry

5038.12 --> 5043.55
I'm sorry to say that I'm the first no

5040.58 --> 5048.71
need to and no need to I don't put

5043.55 --> 5052.55
myself in that situation well you do you

5048.71 --> 5054.83
did you don't think you did by talking
