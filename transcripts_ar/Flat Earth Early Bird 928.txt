so today the weather is

87.04 --> 94.159
yeah moist i think that's

90.479 --> 94.56
my characteristic thing about today it's

94.159 --> 97.759
just

94.56 --> 101.84
very moist it actually rained

97.759 --> 101.84
in the night did cool off a little

102.24 --> 106.079
and this morning it was like not too bad

105.439 --> 109.19999999999999
but

106.079 --> 111.52
yeah kind of past 12 it got really hot

109.2 --> 111.52
again

111.6 --> 119.03999999999999
and what was left of the

114.96 --> 121.119
moist also evaporated and so yeah it's

119.04 --> 124.47900000000001
kind of hot

121.119 --> 125.92
and moist there isn't really much wind

124.479 --> 129.84
either so

125.92 --> 129.84
it's kind of a bit of a sticky day

140.0 --> 146.56
not very blue kind of hazy

143.52 --> 146.56
up there anyway

151.28 --> 158.64000000000001
okay hello agm

154.879 --> 158.64
first in chat good to see you

159.28 --> 170.319
it's friday

162.319 --> 173.44
the 18th of june 2021

170.319 --> 176.95899999999997
and yeah friday

173.44 --> 176.959
usually interesting

177.2 --> 179.51899999999998
uh

180.72 --> 186.8
i hope too answer some questions in the

185.44 --> 189.44
next two hours

186.8 --> 190.08
ha started on time completely by the way

189.44 --> 191.84
today

190.08 --> 195.92000000000002
very happy about that got up a little

191.84 --> 199.84
early despite going to bed pretty late

195.92 --> 199.83999999999997
i guess that

200.8 --> 204.4
because the cool night yeah i did sleep

203.519 --> 207.59900000000002
very well

204.4 --> 209.519
didn't get up all sweaty because

207.599 --> 211.67999999999998
it doesn't really help my rest when it's

209.519 --> 216.72
very hot

211.68 --> 216.72
in the early afternoon late mornings

217.12 --> 220.4
but it was all right so

221.2 --> 223.51899999999998
right

224.4 --> 227.84
let's see

228.159 --> 232.159
what did i do yesterday

235.68 --> 241.84
all right

242.959 --> 247.04
right there were some streams yesterday

244.72 --> 249.68
but i kind of didn't watch

247.04 --> 249.67999999999998
any of them

250.159 --> 255.599
instead i watched a lot of it crowd

253.439 --> 257.28
i've seen that before but just i don't

255.599 --> 260.32
know if

257.28 --> 260.32
that type of humor

261.04 --> 264.47900000000004
started watching that like two days ago

263.759 --> 268.96000000000004
just

264.479 --> 272.08
because it came by on netflix

268.96 --> 274.15999999999997
but yeah that was fun so did that place

272.08 --> 277.35999999999996
the games

274.16 --> 280.96000000000004
and watch

277.36 --> 281.52000000000004
um benjamin also watched like his latest

280.96 --> 284.23999999999995
stream

281.52 --> 284.24
this morning

286.4 --> 288.63899999999995
and

293.44 --> 297.84
get the feeling i'm missing something

295.12 --> 297.84000000000003
here

298.96 --> 305.59999999999997
right and i gotta get a new note block

302.639 --> 307.919
because i ran out of notes out of note

305.6 --> 307.91900000000004
paper

308.479 --> 312.15999999999997
so i might get that somewhere after this

310.479 --> 314.4
show

312.16 --> 314.40000000000003
uh

319.36 --> 325.84000000000003
oh yeah of course football

322.88 --> 325.84
i mean soccer

328.96 --> 334.08
have you seen second season black summer

331.919 --> 339.28
no i don't watch those types of series

334.08 --> 342.4
agm because i don't

339.28 --> 343.28
don't really there's a lot of i can

342.4 --> 346.32
already guess

343.28 --> 349.67999999999995
what type of series that's gonna be

346.32 --> 352.56
with the title in it i i don't really

349.68 --> 355.68
watch those types of shows

352.56 --> 358.08
scotland versus england tonight yeah

355.68 --> 360.96
yeah

358.08 --> 362.71999999999997
that that should be interesting in one

360.96 --> 364.56
way or the other

362.72 --> 366.88000000000005
but yeah yesterday the netherlands

364.56 --> 369.44
played also

366.88 --> 369.44
so again

373.039 --> 376.8
forgotten we're already playing against

381.92 --> 385.04
[Music]

393.6 --> 395.91900000000004
come on

400.319 --> 409.84000000000003
shouldn't be too hard to look up

410.96 --> 416.63899999999995
austria right thanks hey jim

414.0 --> 419.44
yeah 2-0 for the netherlands it was it

416.639 --> 419.44
was a cool game

419.52 --> 425.68
it's no grave injustices are

423.52 --> 426.88
i think that the referees are doing

425.68 --> 429.599
pretty good

426.88 --> 429.599
on average

432.319 --> 437.44
so yeah that first penalty was

434.16 --> 440.16
definitely called for

437.44 --> 442.319
but yeah the austrians played pretty

440.16 --> 444.24
good too

442.319 --> 445.36
they really did make an effort to kind

444.24 --> 450.479
of

445.36 --> 453.12
equal the score but yeah

450.479 --> 456.71999999999997
it was a cool game so two successful

453.12 --> 456.72
games for the netherlands so far

457.759 --> 462.72
who knows we we might win this one

463.199 --> 468.879
if if this stuff keeps up but yeah i'm

466.8 --> 473.199
also just

468.879 --> 473.199
i'm really liking the players

474.639 --> 478.319
like some of them i've already known

476.319 --> 480.96000000000004
from previous games

478.319 --> 481.52000000000004
but yeah some new guys and they're

480.96 --> 493.84
they're just

481.52 --> 493.84
all pretty cool guys

496.24 --> 498.56
all right

502.0 --> 507.84
hello by the way george sanford

515.76 --> 521.8389999999999
i know them

523.21 --> 526.33
[Applause]

532.839 --> 535.839
right

557.68 --> 562.56
right so i'm not super familiar with the

560.16 --> 566.88
names and even where they come from

562.56 --> 569.76
because yeah i'm not a total soccer fan

566.88 --> 572.48
i just happen to really like the

569.76 --> 576.56
international

572.48 --> 580.0
the international tournaments

576.56 --> 580.0
had that since i was a kid

585.44 --> 589.2790000000001
but yeah i take my sampling basically of

588.56 --> 592.2399999999999
what i see

589.279 --> 593.6
in the game how the players play what

592.24 --> 602.16
they talk about

593.6 --> 602.16
and i'm just liking it so far

602.839 --> 605.839
um

607.76 --> 611.519
who do you think that will win the

609.76 --> 614.56
tournament i think the netherlands

611.519 --> 614.5600000000001
makes a good shot

614.64 --> 622.0
i really do

618.72 --> 624.24
italy well it's

622.0 --> 626.399
it's still too soon to tell but i'm

624.24 --> 629.6800000000001
going to be biased

626.399 --> 633.839
i just got a really good feeling about

629.68 --> 633.8389999999999
the group this this time

634.64 --> 637.92
like because there is a really good

636.56 --> 641.3599999999999
moral going around

637.92 --> 643.76
also the winning helps right

641.36 --> 644.5600000000001
the group really gets tested when they

643.76 --> 648.16
don't win

644.56 --> 651.92
especially when it tensions

648.16 --> 655.12
tenses things up right but yeah

651.92 --> 655.68
too soon i just got a good feeling about

655.12 --> 658.16
her

655.68 --> 659.5999999999999
about this group and i think they'll

658.16 --> 662.3199999999999
make it very far

659.6 --> 665.9200000000001
like they'll probably at least make the

662.32 --> 665.9200000000001
finals or quarter finals

670.959 --> 677.76
but yeah i haven't even really seen

674.24 --> 677.76
too many of the other games

678.88 --> 682.0
because there's a lot of football going

680.959 --> 684.88
around of course

682.0 --> 686.839
in a single day like three matches every

684.88 --> 689.68
time

686.839 --> 691.839
and i'm not

689.68 --> 693.04
that captivated by football that i'm

691.839 --> 696.1600000000001
gonna watch

693.04 --> 698.48
every day three matches like it's too

696.16 --> 698.48
much

701.04 --> 705.519
but if there's an interesting uh duel

704.24 --> 707.519
going on

705.519 --> 709.36
like between england and scotland i'm

707.519 --> 710.88
definitely gonna watch

709.36 --> 712.399
right so i'm definitely gonna watch

710.88 --> 713.8389999999999
tonight

712.399 --> 716.079
because yeah that that must be

713.839 --> 719.7600000000001
interesting that like scotland england

716.079 --> 721.1999999999999
is like a set up if the netherlands will

719.76 --> 724.3199999999999
go up against belgium

721.2 --> 726.24
right it's like really close neighbor so

724.32 --> 728.639
there's like this extra thing to it it

726.24 --> 728.639
should be

728.839 --> 731.839
interesting

732.48 --> 735.519
hello irs

738.8 --> 742.079
right don't worry this is not the flat

741.6 --> 745.36
earth

742.079 --> 749.1999999999999
football show i'm not gonna flatter

745.36 --> 751.279
soccer i'm not gonna talk about that

749.2 --> 752.32
the entire show but it did come up it is

751.279 --> 755.76
going down and

752.32 --> 759.12
yeah i am just i'm interested in that

755.76 --> 759.92
i like watching it what i don't like is

759.12 --> 764.24
watching the

759.92 --> 764.24
freaking commercials in between god

769.68 --> 776.959
like watching dutch television

773.519 --> 778.88
channel again and just seeing those

776.959 --> 782.8
commercials i've had moments where i

778.88 --> 786.48
literally just almost threw up

782.8 --> 790.8
oh how i have not missed the freaking

786.48 --> 790.8000000000001
television dutch commercials god

792.56 --> 801.8389999999999
it's terrible

805.6 --> 812.0
also by the way little side thingy

808.639 --> 815.279
i thought it was interesting that uh

812.0 --> 818.48
damn what's his name again ronaldo

815.279 --> 822.48
that super superstar

818.48 --> 824.72
football that he like

822.48 --> 827.04
refused to do an interview with the

824.72 --> 830.1600000000001
coca-cola bottle in the screen

827.04 --> 833.04
that he insisted on

830.16 --> 834.959
on having that out like and yeah that he

833.04 --> 835.5999999999999
was even public about like he doesn't

834.959 --> 839.04
like it

835.6 --> 841.1990000000001
he thinks it's bad right and that got

839.04 --> 842.56
all kinds of conflict with the sponsors

841.199 --> 844.639
in black but i just thought it was

842.56 --> 849.3599999999999
awesome that he did that

844.639 --> 852.32
right that's that's a that's a person

849.36 --> 853.6800000000001
taking a a risk with their financiers to

852.32 --> 857.12
really

853.68 --> 859.519
put out a moral message and

857.12 --> 861.68
just shows that he actually really cares

859.519 --> 864.88
about the health

861.68 --> 867.519
of people so i thought that was

864.88 --> 867.519
commendable

869.36 --> 873.6
right nothing to do really with football

871.6 --> 874.32
but that also happened caught my

873.6 --> 878.24
attention

874.32 --> 880.32
i thought it was pretty cool uh

878.24 --> 882.399
because yeah coca-cola is really [ __ ]

880.32 --> 885.839
for you

882.399 --> 885.839
don't drink it

888.56 --> 904.399
hey hello mac michael calm

899.12 --> 904.399
oh man a little short on breath here

905.04 --> 908.3199999999999
because there's just a lot of moist in

906.88 --> 911.519
the air with the heat

908.32 --> 911.519
get a little short of breath

918.0 --> 923.12
i got green tea here but i wonder if it

921.199 --> 927.199
was really that smart an idea

923.12 --> 930.24
when i made it it wasn't this warm yet

927.199 --> 930.24
hello good servant

937.759 --> 944.399
ah doable

941.04 --> 947.12
right so round out my

944.399 --> 948.72
jaw situation because yeah i'm doing

947.12 --> 952.32
basically kind of a medical

948.72 --> 956.1600000000001
open thing here for study

952.32 --> 959.759
and it i i have concluded my test

956.16 --> 963.12
successfully in my opinion

959.759 --> 965.6
i ate the remainders of the spaghetti

963.12 --> 966.32
yesterday not they didn't make lasagna

965.6 --> 969.36
out of it

966.32 --> 973.44
threw the cheese sauce away did use

969.36 --> 977.759
sprinkle cheese was a great meal

973.44 --> 981.44
and yeah i can absolutely now conclude

977.759 --> 982.48
it is the bechamel sauce that causes my

981.44 --> 985.44
jaw to hurt

982.48 --> 986.32
because i i didn't get anything when i

985.44 --> 989.12
ate it

986.32 --> 989.36
and not this morning either even though

989.12 --> 993.199
i

989.36 --> 995.44
ate the spaghetti sauce the same sauce

993.199 --> 997.04
and it's been like like i made it four

995.44 --> 1000.9590000000001
days ago so it wasn't like

997.04 --> 1003.12
super super fresh right

1000.959 --> 1005.3599999999999
and despite that didn't have any

1003.12 --> 1009.44
problems

1005.36 --> 1011.519
so it really was the sauce

1009.44 --> 1012.9590000000001
and today i'm like yeah that's just

1011.519 --> 1014.8
perfect

1012.959 --> 1019.1199999999999
i can do anything with it there's no

1014.8 --> 1019.12
pressure no heat sensitivity nothing

1020.56 --> 1026.559
ah so right i'm gonna stop talking about

1024.0 --> 1030.0
that now probably quite a few people

1026.559 --> 1034.0
that don't really want to know

1030.0 --> 1035.28
about that part so happy to report that

1034.0 --> 1039.839
i'm not going to be

1035.28 --> 1039.839
complaining about my jaw

1040.16 --> 1043.3600000000001
for a while at least

1044.24 --> 1048.559
uh send arwen the video i showed you

1150.08 --> 1157.28
before the end of the year i'll pass

1151.919 --> 1157.2800000000002
the 2k mark wouldn't that be something

1182.559 --> 1186.24
think i'm gonna take off my t-shirt

1187.36 --> 1193.84
this is really breaking my focus

1209.6 --> 1217.76
okay hm

1212.88 --> 1221.0390000000002
what's that oh awesome that's just great

1217.76 --> 1225.44
yeah that requires me to to log in with

1221.039 --> 1225.44
my facebook which i don't have agent

1232.84 --> 1235.84
so

1240.72 --> 1244.559
right i don't know how big the file

1242.64 --> 1247.2
would be

1244.559 --> 1248.1589999999999
but hey you could potentially download

1247.2 --> 1251.28
it and then

1248.159 --> 1254.4
send it to me over skype as a file just

1251.28 --> 1256.559
download it to your desktop

1254.4 --> 1258.3200000000002
to your file library on your phone or

1256.559 --> 1262.559
whatever and just

1258.32 --> 1266.32
drag and drop the original file in skype

1262.559 --> 1266.32
and that way you can probably send it

1266.64 --> 1279.919
anyway watch the moon

1276.64 --> 1283.76
yeah i can't watch the file agm like i

1279.919 --> 1283.76
don't have a facebook account to log in

1288.84 --> 1295.52
with

1291.84 --> 1296.9599999999998
oh yeah that agent

1295.52 --> 1299.12
doesn't really matter if you're now

1296.96 --> 1305.28
gonna send me the same link

1299.12 --> 1308.3999999999999
over over skype it's still the same link

1305.28 --> 1311.44
i didn't mean the link i meant the file

1308.4 --> 1313.44
the file video file i take it right if

1311.44 --> 1317.3600000000001
you want to send it to me

1313.44 --> 1320.159
download it and then drop drag and drop

1317.36 --> 1322.08
the video file in skype and that way i

1320.159 --> 1324.3200000000002
could get it

1322.08 --> 1324.32
oh

1326.64 --> 1333.8400000000001
did you just do it good servant i see a

1330.84 --> 1333.84
file

1334.799 --> 1337.36
what's this

1341.12 --> 1347.84
oh god get the [ __ ] life

1385.039 --> 1389.84
all right

1397.2 --> 1400.48
jesus that's a big file

1401.679 --> 1405.44
i mean a big resolution

1406.0 --> 1408.799
okay whoa

1414.0 --> 1421.679
that's freaking cgi dude

1417.2 --> 1421.679
that is cgi

1424.08 --> 1430.3999999999999
that's photoshopped in there i

1426.96 --> 1431.919
immediately know

1430.4 --> 1433.679
or maybe it was holographically

1431.919 --> 1435.1200000000001
projected on there if you saw it with

1433.679 --> 1438.24
your own eyes

1435.12 --> 1438.8799999999999
if you saw that with your own eyes i

1438.24 --> 1442.48
might

1438.88 --> 1442.48
consider it but yeah

1442.96 --> 1450.159
look seriously

1446.88 --> 1454.0
the guy obviously hand

1450.159 --> 1457.44
filming it you got this

1454.0 --> 1459.36
spectacle of supposed what seems like an

1457.44 --> 1461.1200000000001
impact or something shooting through the

1459.36 --> 1464.8799999999999
moon and he's not like

1461.12 --> 1466.6399999999999
whoa whoa what the [ __ ] is that

1464.88 --> 1468.4
yeah yeah that's what happened if you'd

1466.64 --> 1470.0
actually see something like that with

1468.4 --> 1473.3600000000001
your own eyes

1470.0 --> 1475.679
okay this is there's no [ __ ]

1473.36 --> 1476.4799999999998
way in hell somebody could keep their

1475.679 --> 1479.279
mouth shut

1476.48 --> 1479.84
when filming something like that live no

1479.279 --> 1486.0
way

1479.84 --> 1488.0
in hell guaranteed cj

1486.0 --> 1491.679
did look pretty interesting though this

1488.0 --> 1491.679
is well crafted

1493.279 --> 1500.4
yeah i'll i'll share it i guess hold on

1496.4 --> 1504.4
let me open it up again dude

1500.4 --> 1506.5590000000002
this is not helping let you freaking

1504.4 --> 1510.72
show it like that

1506.559 --> 1515.84
uh okay let me set up the

1510.72 --> 1515.84
obs to present this

1521.919 --> 1532.4
yeah all right great

1529.2 --> 1535.039
let's see how can i

1532.4 --> 1535.039
make this

1536.799 --> 1547.12
right okay

1543.279 --> 1550.24
yeah that should do it all right

1547.12 --> 1552.3999999999999
so there you go this is

1550.24 --> 1552.4
it

1554.0 --> 1557.84
turn back on the sound

1562.67 --> 1572.96
[Music]

1569.52 --> 1575.44
yeah oh that's helpful

1572.96 --> 1575.44
thanks

1580.64 --> 1587.2
why didn't it do that

1584.72 --> 1587.2
okay

1596.84 --> 1602.24
right

1599.6 --> 1604.3999999999999
right my reaction during the airplane

1602.24 --> 1606.72
and that's just an airplane that just so

1604.4 --> 1610.0800000000002
happens to fly through the screen

1606.72 --> 1612.4
right that's just that's like a a normal

1610.08 --> 1614.0
potentially normal but rare event yeah

1612.4 --> 1617.76
that made me absolutely like

1614.0 --> 1620.0
whoa that's right so yeah you see that

1617.76 --> 1621.6
with your eyes happening right in front

1620.0 --> 1621.919
of you as you're filming it you're gonna

1621.6 --> 1625.6
be

1621.919 --> 1627.76
at least shaken like holy [ __ ] what's

1625.6 --> 1632.08
that

1627.76 --> 1635.039
so a rock

1632.08 --> 1636.72
split in half it's the whole thing is

1635.039 --> 1640.399
ridiculous

1636.72 --> 1644.72
but it it's uh like it looked

1640.399 --> 1645.9189999999999
decent enough but it's just obviously

1644.72 --> 1650.3990000000001
cgi

1645.919 --> 1650.3990000000001
anyway thanks for sharing that

1651.6 --> 1659.9189999999999
hey amanda young good to see you

1655.44 --> 1659.919
mark martin yatsem

1660.64 --> 1663.76
ah hello

1664.08 --> 1669.84
somebody from portugal welcome to the

1666.0 --> 1669.84
stream welcome to chat

1674.0 --> 1683.84
and also michael khan hello of course

1694.84 --> 1697.84
hmm

1710.64 --> 1719.8400000000001
hmm right well michael khan do

1714.72 --> 1723.279
do you remember the uh name again

1719.84 --> 1727.12
was a movie was it

1723.279 --> 1729.76
that the remake of the time machine

1727.12 --> 1731.4399999999998
where they you like went into the future

1729.76 --> 1733.12
and then at some point it's like oh

1731.44 --> 1735.76
disasters hit

1733.12 --> 1738.1589999999999
because the moon just there was a mining

1735.76 --> 1741.2
accident in the moon and it literally

1738.159 --> 1743.1200000000001
exploded like it fractured and then they

1741.2 --> 1746.159
showed this image of literally

1743.12 --> 1749.1999999999998
the moon in pieces hanging

1746.159 --> 1752.7990000000002
together sort of was really weird

1749.2 --> 1754.559
but yeah

1752.799 --> 1757.12
if something would actually shoot

1754.559 --> 1761.36
straight through it

1757.12 --> 1765.039
as the editing suggested

1761.36 --> 1766.799
yeah unless it's hollow

1765.039 --> 1769.279
there's no way that it would get

1766.799 --> 1769.279
together

1777.36 --> 1781.84
michael khan what are you saying

1785.84 --> 1789.52
guy pierce is that a person

1791.76 --> 1796.0
because if that's a name you might want

1793.52 --> 1798.72
to next time use capital letter so

1796.0 --> 1809.84
it's actually clear that it's supposed

1798.72 --> 1809.84
to be a name

1819.6 --> 1823.84
ah man

1827.44 --> 1831.1200000000001
all right they got a little new weird

1829.6 --> 1833.76
little arwanian

1831.12 --> 1834.8799999999999
thing well not really irwin it's just

1833.76 --> 1836.8799999999999
that

1834.88 --> 1838.0
you know how some trolls really like to

1836.88 --> 1840.72
call me

1838.0 --> 1842.799
a paperboy well guess what i'm a

1840.72 --> 1845.919
paperboy no more

1842.799 --> 1850.08
i didn't get fired but

1845.919 --> 1853.919
yeah the uh the newspaper routes

1850.08 --> 1856.399
they were basically cancelled

1853.919 --> 1858.3990000000001
apparently i don't think the newspaper

1856.399 --> 1859.9189999999999
that i'm spreading is doing very good it

1858.399 --> 1862.799
might have lost some funding

1859.919 --> 1863.519
or can't get enough personnel there's

1862.799 --> 1866.48
yeah

1863.519 --> 1867.519
they've basically retracted the

1866.48 --> 1870.64
neighborhood

1867.519 --> 1875.84
that i deliver papers in so

1870.64 --> 1879.8400000000001
yeah it was interesting while it lasted

1875.84 --> 1879.84
didn't really make any money off it

1881.919 --> 1893.8400000000001
i am a paperboy no more

1897.6 --> 1900.6399999999999
time machine start guy pierce right i

1900.0 --> 1902.96
thought so

1900.64 --> 1904.3200000000002
i thought you meant to name it i do

1902.96 --> 1907.8400000000001
remember somebody called

1904.32 --> 1907.84
guy pierce it's just i

2424.64 --> 2426.8799999999997
week

2428.079 --> 2435.2000000000003
any feedback on things that i've stated

2431.76 --> 2438.96
i'm really really hoping to get

2435.2 --> 2442.319
like critical feedback i'm

2438.96 --> 2442.319
it's tough you know because

2443.52 --> 2450.24
i'm really expecting

2446.88 --> 2451.44
people to basically see some of the

2450.24 --> 2455.04
things that i've said

2451.44 --> 2456.4
and then be like okay yeah i kind of

2455.04 --> 2458.8
like what you said but

2456.4 --> 2460.7200000000003
here and there you said this and that

2458.8 --> 2464.079
and that's not entirely correct

2460.72 --> 2466.0789999999997
look here is a study

2464.079 --> 2468.2400000000002
that actually shows it's slightly

2466.079 --> 2469.6800000000003
different like that or elaborate onto

2468.24 --> 2470.72
certain things that i've been talking

2469.68 --> 2474.0
about as a

2470.72 --> 2475.359
well non-medical expert because or well

2474.0 --> 2478.48
medical expert

2475.359 --> 2479.44
a non-doctor because i am not officially

2478.48 --> 2482.16
studied

2479.44 --> 2483.68
but i have paid attention and i'm kind

2482.16 --> 2487.2
of disappointed that i'm getting

2483.68 --> 2491.04
very little feedback

2487.2 --> 2494.24
on it is it

2491.04 --> 2494.56
because for example when i say there is

2494.24 --> 2499.5989999999997
no

2494.56 --> 2501.599
viruses it's a faulty presupposition

2499.599 --> 2503.44
and it's always kind of condition

2501.599 --> 2507.28
related instead

2503.44 --> 2510.8
i get so little feedback from that

2507.28 --> 2513.8390000000004
i i don't even know if

2510.8 --> 2515.8390000000004
if anybody can hear it when i say that

2513.839 --> 2518.24
or is this something that i just have to

2515.839 --> 2522.0
do so that in 10 years time

2518.24 --> 2525.04
everybody can be what the [ __ ]

2522.0 --> 2526.64
arwyn was literally saying that on a on

2525.04 --> 2530.64
a weekly basis

2526.64 --> 2534.16
for like a year 10 years ago

2530.64 --> 2537.44
right maybe it might turn out to be that

2534.16 --> 2540.0789999999997
maybe the world just wants

2537.44 --> 2542.88
viruses they won't let it go in their

2540.079 --> 2545.76
mind they would need it to exist

2542.88 --> 2546.48
personally they need that fear and the

2545.76 --> 2549.2000000000003
danger

2546.48 --> 2549.68
maybe maybe people just don't want to

2549.2 --> 2553.7599999999998
know

2549.68 --> 2556.8799999999997
that viruses don't and can't exist

2553.76 --> 2559.5200000000004
right i'm getting very very little

2556.88 --> 2561.599
feedback on this

2559.52 --> 2562.72
and also not getting a lot of feedback

2561.599 --> 2565.599
on my

2562.72 --> 2566.24
maybe christ didn't actually die

2565.599 --> 2569.599
although i

2566.24 --> 2572.0
am getting a lot of chanting of people

2569.599 --> 2574.2400000000002
that just chant like i

2572.0 --> 2577.119
know it's like this this is how we've

2574.24 --> 2579.4399999999996
all learned it for centuries even nobody

2577.119 --> 2582.6400000000003
even though nobody can actually explain

2579.44 --> 2582.64
how that is logical

2584.0 --> 2587.599
i've had people that have kind of agreed

2586.8 --> 2589.28
with me

2587.599 --> 2591.04
kind of agreed at least with the reason

2589.28 --> 2593.119
why i do it

2591.04 --> 2595.52
that they're all holding their tongue in

2593.119 --> 2595.52
public

2595.599 --> 2600.48
apparently i'm engaging in something

2597.68 --> 2604.48
that's really scary

2600.48 --> 2607.28
right and in a way yeah it does

2604.48 --> 2610.4
make me nervous then again i'm typically

2607.28 --> 2610.4
born for that [ __ ]

2611.28 --> 2617.2000000000003
i ask the question that makes everybody

2614.72 --> 2617.2
hate me

2618.0 --> 2622.0
right not because it's the wrong

2620.88 --> 2624.4
question to ask but

2622.0 --> 2625.44
because it's the right question to ask

2624.4 --> 2630.0
that nobody

2625.44 --> 2630.0
wanted anybody to ask

2630.48 --> 2635.04
that those types of weird scenarios i

2632.96 --> 2635.76
don't remember the details throughout my

2635.04 --> 2638.96
life

2635.76 --> 2642.6400000000003
at a really really young age even like

2638.96 --> 2642.64
pre-teen i'd still do that

2642.72 --> 2646.72
basically i've been doing the same

2644.8 --> 2649.3590000000004
pattern

2646.72 --> 2651.839
with my intellect that i'm doing now my

2649.359 --> 2653.92
entire life

2651.839 --> 2656.24
except now i have a lot more confidence

2653.92 --> 2660.839
a lot more things to reflect on

2656.24 --> 2663.839
a lot yeah that's the really the only

2660.839 --> 2663.839
difference

2665.04 --> 2668.8
if you look about 10 15 years ago what

2667.2 --> 2676.64
are some of the major predictions

2668.8 --> 2680.6400000000003
that have come true uh globalism

2676.64 --> 2685.839
autocracy mind control conspiracy

2680.64 --> 2685.839
or also known as the illuminati

2691.76 --> 2698.96
right and the virus playbook

2695.76 --> 2698.96
the virus dance

2699.76 --> 2703.119
but that thing was already unrolling in

2702.0 --> 2706.4
the last

2703.119 --> 2706.4
10 to 20 years

2706.88 --> 2714.6400000000003
you know like look just look at how many

2710.64 --> 2719.2
flu vaccines were already happening

2714.64 --> 2721.44
and disease and then vaccines

2719.2 --> 2723.2799999999997
sometimes diseases with animals

2721.44 --> 2725.2000000000003
supposedly

2723.28 --> 2727.0400000000004
like it's already been going for a while

2725.2 --> 2729.7599999999998
i've i really wonder like

2727.04 --> 2730.839
how much of a difference really is like

2729.76 --> 2734.88
the flu

2730.839 --> 2738.56
shot that's been out there

2734.88 --> 2739.04
for over a decade and obviously doesn't

2738.56 --> 2740.72
work

2739.04 --> 2742.48
everybody that i've ever known that's

2740.72 --> 2745.5989999999997
taken it usually

2742.48 --> 2746.88
on average gets more of the flu than

2745.599 --> 2750.2400000000002
those that don't

2746.88 --> 2754.079
without exception without a single

2750.24 --> 2756.3999999999996
exception right but i wonder

2754.079 --> 2756.4
really

2757.119 --> 2763.2000000000003
how much weird experimentation [ __ ] even

2759.92 --> 2763.2000000000003
happened with all those

2769.04 --> 2775.68
did they have like rna protein

2772.56 --> 2777.839
altering substances in there as well

2775.68 --> 2780.3999999999996
and it just never got the attention of

2777.839 --> 2780.4
the public

2782.56 --> 2789.839
i don't know

2793.68 --> 2796.8799999999997
all right one of other predictions that

2795.839 --> 2799.839
came true

2796.88 --> 2801.6800000000003
and that i even made but the whole half

2799.839 --> 2806.64
the world

2801.68 --> 2806.64
10 years ago during the obama era

2807.359 --> 2812.56
it was blatantly obvious they are going

2809.52 --> 2815.7599999999998
to try to promote

2812.56 --> 2819.04
uh like

2815.76 --> 2822.1600000000003
well yeah trans stuff and trans kids

2819.04 --> 2824.72
and even eventually just getting more

2822.16 --> 2828.16
open towards pedophilia

2824.72 --> 2831.839
that was predicted like 10 years ago and

2828.16 --> 2831.839
that's all coming true

2832.88 --> 2836.96
i think a lot of people saw it coming

2834.96 --> 2839.119
they just couldn't handle that that

2836.96 --> 2840.7200000000003
might actually become true

2839.119 --> 2842.88
i think most people probably thought it

2840.72 --> 2845.359
was a bluff

2842.88 --> 2847.44
in a way i did i just couldn't really

2845.359 --> 2859.839
handle it

2847.44 --> 2859.839
but yeah that came true

2860.079 --> 2867.8390000000004
oh huh one of my predictions

2865.92 --> 2868.96
i think i even made that on the early

2867.839 --> 2872.7999999999997
bird show by the way

2868.96 --> 2874.7200000000003
also is that

2872.8 --> 2876.88
and i even thought that i was wrong for

2874.72 --> 2878.9599999999996
a while but it might be that i was right

2876.88 --> 2882.4
after all is that

2878.96 --> 2883.52
the third world war this situation

2882.4 --> 2886.96
that's happening it's

2883.52 --> 2890.319
a form of like a semi-cold war that

2886.96 --> 2891.839
might and pop as a hot war at the last

2890.319 --> 2893.839
minute

2891.839 --> 2895.04
but it might take a long time or never

2893.839 --> 2898.4
get to that

2895.04 --> 2901.44
that it would be hackers

2898.4 --> 2905.92
and weather weapons

2901.44 --> 2908.0
right well haven't you all seen a whole

2905.92 --> 2912.16
lot of that

2908.0 --> 2915.359
in many many ways many ways

2912.16 --> 2917.44
right hackers and weather weapons yes

2915.359 --> 2920.319
and of course

2917.44 --> 2921.44
the main form of the war is

2920.319 --> 2924.16
psychological

2921.44 --> 2925.2000000000003
it's psychological warfare it's mind

2924.16 --> 2928.64
control

2925.2 --> 2931.52
that's been the primary pushing factor

2928.64 --> 2932.48
to gain control i didn't really mention

2931.52 --> 2935.92
it

2932.48 --> 2939.2
but yeah that the other factor

2935.92 --> 2942.319
like how what are the

2939.2 --> 2944.5589999999997
devices of war well hacking

2942.319 --> 2946.48
and weather weapons and the hacking is

2944.559 --> 2950.0
blatantly obvious just done by the

2946.48 --> 2953.68
secret services to pin in on others

2950.0 --> 2957.04
and to just disrupt economic growth

2953.68 --> 2959.2
it's not just like oh it's random people

2957.04 --> 2960.8
that are doing it just to screw or

2959.2 --> 2963.52
something

2960.8 --> 2964.079
and yeah the weather weapons man holy

2963.52 --> 2967.68
[ __ ]

2964.079 --> 2970.96
is that becoming apparent or what

2967.68 --> 2973.2
like even years ago already the uh

2970.96 --> 2974.4
projected energy weapons that were used

2973.2 --> 2977.4399999999996
to just melt

2974.4 --> 2980.0
entire buildings and cars

2977.44 --> 2982.64
and all that [ __ ] i think that pretty

2980.0 --> 2984.96
much falls under weather weaponry

2982.64 --> 2986.48
well it's more like projected energy

2984.96 --> 2989.92
weapons

2986.48 --> 2992.88
but that combining with just

2989.92 --> 2992.88
chemtrails

2995.72 --> 2999.68
geoengineering yeah weather weapons seem

2998.16 --> 3002.24
to be a tool

2999.68 --> 3002.24
of use

3003.599 --> 3007.6800000000003
television is a huge weapon well not as

3006.079 --> 3013.8390000000004
huge as it used to be

3007.68 --> 3013.839
michael khan

3019.04 --> 3027.839
there's a lot of internet now

3027.92 --> 3033.92
cyber attacks in it what's your aliens

3031.04 --> 3035.359
what aliens you mean the aliens people

3033.92 --> 3040.0
have been talking about

3035.359 --> 3043.04
for over a hundred years

3040.0 --> 3043.839
not a hundred eighty years is it when is

3043.04 --> 3047.599
roswell

3043.839 --> 3049.2
whatever a long time

3047.599 --> 3055.839
they're coming they're going where where

3049.2 --> 3055.839
are they then where where

3059.76 --> 3063.079
do i think quantum computers in the

3061.599 --> 3064.6400000000003
future will be able to defeat

3063.079 --> 3066.1600000000003
cryptography

3064.64 --> 3068.7999999999997
well i don't even think quantum

3066.16 --> 3072.5589999999997
computers exist

3068.8 --> 3076.079
i think it's a cover it's just a name

3072.559 --> 3076.48
they give it like viruses yeah it's like

3076.079 --> 3080.319
oh

3076.48 --> 3083.319
oh this is a virus infection oh really

3080.319 --> 3086.319
yeah this is a quantum computer oh

3083.319 --> 3086.319
really

3086.88 --> 3090.96
i don't think so i think it's complete

3094.839 --> 3097.839
[ __ ]

3111.04 --> 3115.44
i think they are modern ouija boards

3120.48 --> 3123.76
well yeah you might have a point with

3122.96 --> 3126.48
that

3123.76 --> 3126.48
michael khan

3136.079 --> 3143.52
like i mean there is something weird to

3139.92 --> 3145.2000000000003
to really yeah these special types of

3143.52 --> 3147.04
computers

3145.2 --> 3149.04
there is something weird with it but the

3147.04 --> 3152.319
idea of quantum

3149.04 --> 3154.64
computing i just don't buy it

3152.319 --> 3157.04
i don't think it has anything to do with

3154.64 --> 3159.7599999999998
quantum state

3157.04 --> 3161.839
i think that's just a concept that they

3159.76 --> 3164.8390000000004
stick on it to make it sound really

3161.839 --> 3167.839
science fictiony i think it's complete

3164.839 --> 3167.839
horseshit

3171.92 --> 3175.599
like it doesn't even really make any

3174.64 --> 3179.04
sense

3175.599 --> 3181.2000000000003
if you think about the idea of the model

3179.04 --> 3182.4
it's like yeah it's in an undecided

3181.2 --> 3185.9199999999996
state and so it can

3182.4 --> 3188.079
instantly answer or like

3185.92 --> 3189.76
answer before you even ask the ques it's

3188.079 --> 3193.76
like who came

3189.76 --> 3195.2000000000003
up with that techno babble mumbo jumbo

3193.76 --> 3198.7200000000003
[ __ ]

3195.2 --> 3201.68
it's the dumbest thing i've ever heard

3198.72 --> 3203.359
like nothing works like that it has

3201.68 --> 3206.72
nothing to do

3203.359 --> 3208.5589999999997
with any quantum situation

3206.72 --> 3209.839
which is already kind of like a little

3208.559 --> 3212.8
dubious

3209.839 --> 3216.0789999999997
it's based on the science fiction parts

3212.8 --> 3216.079
of quantum mechanics

3216.319 --> 3219.44
because there are science fiction

3218.319 --> 3221.2799999999997
elements to

3219.44 --> 3222.48
what came out of quantum mechanics

3221.28 --> 3224.4
eventually

3222.48 --> 3225.839
more like the stories that came out of

3224.4 --> 3227.119
it like i'm not saying that quantum

3225.839 --> 3230.5589999999997
mechanics in itself

3227.119 --> 3233.04
are science fiction although i've never

3230.559 --> 3234.96
physically personally tested the things

3233.04 --> 3235.68
that i wanted to test about it in order

3234.96 --> 3240.7200000000003
to be sure

3235.68 --> 3240.72
how real it is right

3241.119 --> 3245.04
i don't think quantum computers even

3242.88 --> 3247.119
really exist

3245.04 --> 3248.96
it's just really fast computers that's

3247.119 --> 3251.119
it it's just like

3248.96 --> 3252.64
make the pathway shorter you make it

3251.119 --> 3255.839
less energy

3252.64 --> 3256.24
inefficient and just more and more and

3255.839 --> 3258.0
more

3256.24 --> 3259.4399999999996
more smaller and smaller and smaller

3258.0 --> 3263.2
smaller and then

3259.44 --> 3265.359
new effects because of the scale start

3263.2 --> 3267.359
to arrive you have to deal with them

3265.359 --> 3268.7999999999997
and then when you master those news of

3267.359 --> 3270.72
new effects you can go

3268.8 --> 3271.8390000000004
even smaller and smaller and smaller

3270.72 --> 3275.2
it's it's just

3271.839 --> 3278.319
it'll get to like molecule per molecule

3275.2 --> 3281.52
chips eventually

3278.319 --> 3285.359
right as not as nothing to do with

3281.52 --> 3285.359
quantum whatsoever

3286.16 --> 3293.839
it's ridiculous

3301.92 --> 3307.04
what will social media look like 10 20

3304.72 --> 3310.0789999999997
years from now

3307.04 --> 3314.079
uh i think it will mostly be just a

3310.079 --> 3314.079
whole lot of instruction videos

3315.04 --> 3324.079
maybe some live journals on top of that

3320.0 --> 3325.04
and a whole bunch of super super super

3324.079 --> 3327.6800000000003
vain people

3325.04 --> 3329.2799999999997
that are just like oh look at this high

3327.68 --> 3332.5589999999997
tech [ __ ] i am so

3329.28 --> 3336.0
good oh look at me look at my 10 000

3332.559 --> 3337.8390000000004
photos a year of me and me

3336.0 --> 3340.559
i mean yeah i think it's just gonna be

3337.839 --> 3340.5589999999997
mostly that

3344.079 --> 3349.6800000000003
and of course just well propaganda

3346.96 --> 3351.68
excitement

3349.68 --> 3353.1189999999997
there's still be people falling for that

3351.68 --> 3362.24
especially the ones that

3353.119 --> 3365.92
don't inform themselves too much

3362.24 --> 3365.9199999999996
what michael kahn

3367.839 --> 3371.92
cern is a giant what

3374.4 --> 3377.839
are you squirting

3378.16 --> 3382.799
or the demons the demons oh they build a

3381.52 --> 3386.0
technology and

3382.799 --> 3388.839
then the horned one comes

3386.0 --> 3391.04
you've been watching too much sci-fi

3388.839 --> 3394.64
dude

3391.04 --> 3398.16
there's no horned man red horned man

3394.64 --> 3400.72
from another dimension gonna get in here

3398.16 --> 3405.1189999999997
you know he's already there in people

3400.72 --> 3407.7599999999998
he's already there

3405.119 --> 3410.96
quantum compute oh you think cern is a

3407.76 --> 3410.96
giant quantum computer

3411.52 --> 3419.04
okay fine

3416.0 --> 3422.319
if you want to think that

3419.04 --> 3433.839
i think cern is just a giant magnet

3422.319 --> 3433.839
that's it

3438.4 --> 3445.359
and like yeah quantum computing again

3441.68 --> 3449.7599999999998
i don't think that it really is anything

3445.359 --> 3453.44
like just think about

3449.76 --> 3456.6400000000003
think about it write it down

3453.44 --> 3457.2000000000003
quantum computing what is it write it

3456.64 --> 3460.0
down

3457.2 --> 3461.9199999999996
right in front of you and then look at

3460.0 --> 3464.24
what you just wrote down

3461.92 --> 3466.64
and and then try to make a logic of what

3464.24 --> 3466.64
it says

3466.96 --> 3472.4
right think about what it actually

3470.0 --> 3475.839
suggests

3472.4 --> 3475.839
nothing about it makes sense

3480.16 --> 3484.799
it just makes you fantasize like oh the

3482.88 --> 3488.4
computer has reached this

3484.799 --> 3491.44
weird subconscious state with

3488.4 --> 3492.1600000000003
god or a devil that's what it makes you

3491.44 --> 3495.28
do

3492.16 --> 3497.7599999999998
because it makes no sense

3495.28 --> 3498.96
it makes you do that because you arrive

3497.76 --> 3501.3590000000004
at a position

3498.96 --> 3503.359
where it doesn't make sense anymore so

3501.359 --> 3505.119
the fantasy then takes over

3503.359 --> 3507.119
because you feel intellectually

3505.119 --> 3508.48
outnumbered by something that you didn't

3507.119 --> 3510.6400000000003
understand

3508.48 --> 3512.559
right this is what happens to a lot of

3510.64 --> 3514.0789999999997
people with a lot of things

3512.559 --> 3515.92
like especially when you talk about

3514.079 --> 3517.92
space-time bending a lot of people get

3515.92 --> 3519.6800000000003
like i don't get this this is kind of

3517.92 --> 3531.839
weird and mystical

3519.68 --> 3531.839
they they don't see it

3534.0 --> 3537.76
30 000 particle colliders in operation

3536.799 --> 3541.28
wow

3537.76 --> 3545.3590000000004
why why

3541.28 --> 3548.7200000000003
george sanford

3545.359 --> 3552.799
it's like why what a complete

3548.72 --> 3554.3999999999996
waste of resources it literally what a

3552.799 --> 3558.079
complete

3554.4 --> 3561.119
and utter waste of resources

3558.079 --> 3564.319
why the hell would you need 30

3561.119 --> 3567.599
000 particle colliders why in the

3564.319 --> 3570.24
hell would anybody in the world need

3567.599 --> 3570.2400000000002
that crap

3570.839 --> 3573.839
why

3574.88 --> 3578.799
it's like i think the money would be

3577.839 --> 3587.839
better spent just

3578.799 --> 3587.839
giving it to nasa

3613.76 --> 3619.5200000000004
that's ridiculous michael khan you can't

3616.88 --> 3619.52
do that

3620.559 --> 3629.52
those things are not physical

3623.599 --> 3632.48
locations those things are spiritual

3629.52 --> 3633.68
and the gates are just right there on

3632.48 --> 3637.2
the other side it's

3633.68 --> 3640.48
called frequency what you do with that

3637.2 --> 3640.48
and i don't see how

3641.119 --> 3647.599
machinery has anything to do with that

3644.64 --> 3650.0
i just don't see it like maybe what the

3647.599 --> 3651.119
machinery does might influence somebody

3650.0 --> 3653.44
that would then

3651.119 --> 3655.04
be drawn into opening the gate or

3653.44 --> 3657.52
something to themselves

3655.04 --> 3659.359
right maybe magnetism in some way i

3657.52 --> 3663.7599999999998
don't know it just seems so

3659.359 --> 3667.2799999999997
unlikely it's just no

3663.76 --> 3670.559
too much sci-fi too much fantasy

3667.28 --> 3673.119
things there is no literal portal gonna

3670.559 --> 3674.1600000000003
open to another dimension from which

3673.119 --> 3676.88
demons

3674.16 --> 3678.3999999999996
with physical bodies come this is

3676.88 --> 3681.52
[ __ ]

3678.4 --> 3686.48
it's [ __ ] it will

3681.52 --> 3686.48
never happen that doesn't exist right

3686.64 --> 3692.4
the the most closest thing that could

3690.319 --> 3694.799
ever happen in my opinion is that

3692.4 --> 3696.7200000000003
yeah a segment to another realm could

3694.799 --> 3698.96
open

3696.72 --> 3701.4399999999996
right which is not another dimension

3698.96 --> 3704.96
it's literally the space next to us

3701.44 --> 3707.839
that is out of reach right now right

3704.96 --> 3708.88
a loop might just open the gates open

3707.839 --> 3710.96
and suddenly

3708.88 --> 3712.0
there is a connection to the other realm

3710.96 --> 3714.559
and then

3712.0 --> 3715.76
beings from that other part might come

3714.559 --> 3718.799
right that

3715.76 --> 3721.599
that might happen there is no just

3718.799 --> 3723.119
oh put the machine here turn on the

3721.599 --> 3725.28
magnets and

3723.119 --> 3727.52
pray with their stupid little satan

3725.28 --> 3728.7200000000003
chants and [ __ ] or whatever the hell

3727.52 --> 3732.0
they do

3728.72 --> 3734.5589999999997
and then like four energy portal

3732.0 --> 3735.599
look at your monster coming through

3734.559 --> 3739.2000000000003
watch too much

3735.599 --> 3740.4
movies man serious too much movies too

3739.2 --> 3743.359
many games

3740.4 --> 3744.559
that doesn't happen it's never going to

3743.359 --> 3747.92
happen do you understand

3744.559 --> 3749.599
ever and i'm not just talking about

3747.92 --> 3750.0
within our lifetime no i'm not talking

3749.599 --> 3752.6400000000003
about

3750.0 --> 3754.559
never ever in history the rest of

3752.64 --> 3758.72
existence physical existence

3754.559 --> 3758.7200000000003
that's never going to happen it's

3766.839 --> 3769.839
ridiculous

3772.319 --> 3776.24
all right and if they say we're trying

3774.559 --> 3777.8390000000004
to open the abyss now well you know what

3776.24 --> 3780.8799999999997
they're doing

3777.839 --> 3782.0
they're trying to open your imagination

3780.88 --> 3784.44
with the suggestion

3782.0 --> 3787.44
that they could do that which is

3784.44 --> 3787.44
preposterous

3790.16 --> 3798.3999999999996
that's like in a similar setting

3794.0 --> 3801.44
the suggestion that they could

3798.4 --> 3805.119
force the return

3801.44 --> 3807.68
of christ right

3805.119 --> 3809.119
like the physical guy coming back from

3807.68 --> 3811.1189999999997
heaven that's the it's the same

3809.119 --> 3813.2000000000003
suggestion like

3811.119 --> 3814.319
evil are we going to force the coming

3813.2 --> 3816.48
back or christ

3814.319 --> 3817.7599999999998
it's like who the [ __ ] do you think you

3816.48 --> 3821.68
are that you could

3817.76 --> 3824.96
meddle with the timelines of

3821.68 --> 3827.2799999999997
existence as as god set them out

3824.96 --> 3828.64
like who the hell do you think you are

3827.28 --> 3832.2400000000002
that you could do that

3828.64 --> 3835.359
right nobody can do that

3832.24 --> 3836.72
but people can be made to believe that

3835.359 --> 3838.72
other people can do that

3836.72 --> 3840.799
and then they're like oh my god these

3838.72 --> 3843.9199999999996
people are so scary they could just

3840.799 --> 3844.319
summon the devil and we'd all die it's

3843.92 --> 3847.76
like

3844.319 --> 3849.92
dude have you thought about what they

3847.76 --> 3850.7990000000004
actually suggest that they're supposedly

3849.92 --> 3853.839
gonna do

3850.799 --> 3853.839
it's ridiculous

3862.16 --> 3866.0
does rectangular looping harm biological

3865.599 --> 3870.2400000000002
beings

3866.0 --> 3873.839
as they pass through the loop no

3870.24 --> 3877.9199999999996
because the loop is basically a special

3873.839 --> 3879.92
a spatial description

3877.92 --> 3882.0
for how the available volume

3879.92 --> 3885.039
interconnects

3882.0 --> 3886.4
right it connects it doesn't do anything

3885.039 --> 3890.4
there's no energy

3886.4 --> 3894.559
nothing it's literally space dynamics

3890.4 --> 3897.359
volume dynamics like volume

3894.559 --> 3899.119
in which physical things can exist

3897.359 --> 3902.48
dynamics

3899.119 --> 3903.52
that's what it is so hey the what could

3902.48 --> 3907.599
happen

3903.52 --> 3911.44
theoretically if i lay down the okay

3907.599 --> 3912.7200000000003
one loop between say the north and the

3911.44 --> 3914.7200000000003
and our segment

3912.72 --> 3915.7599999999998
of the realm open up but what would

3914.72 --> 3917.5989999999997
happen is hey

3915.76 --> 3919.599
there's certainly air connection so

3917.599 --> 3922.48
whatever is in the air on either side

3919.599 --> 3924.4
that could go to the other side right

3922.48 --> 3926.079
things could get poison

3924.4 --> 3928.64
creatures could come through even

3926.079 --> 3931.28
predatory potentially who knows it all

3928.64 --> 3935.5989999999997
depends on what's on the other side

3931.28 --> 3937.599
right but literally moving through

3935.599 --> 3939.76
the open up connections not gonna do

3937.599 --> 3942.96
anything

3939.76 --> 3945.28
unless well the other realm has all

3942.96 --> 3946.559
kinds of different energies subjected to

3945.28 --> 3949.52
it you know if

3946.559 --> 3950.599
the other location has like much

3949.52 --> 3953.68
stronger

3950.599 --> 3954.799
electromagnetics like literally

3953.68 --> 3957.359
everywhere

3954.799 --> 3959.44
that might have an impact like that

3957.359 --> 3961.2799999999997
might literally create a difference like

3959.44 --> 3962.0
if you move in that or something there

3961.28 --> 3964.559
moves

3962.0 --> 3966.88
from in that out of it right such

3964.559 --> 3970.6400000000003
influences perhaps

3966.88 --> 3973.92
but literally the dynamics of the loop

3970.64 --> 3976.799
effect is nothing like it's

3973.92 --> 3977.6800000000003
literally nothing it's just how space

3976.799 --> 3979.44
interconnects

3977.68 --> 3982.0
it doesn't do anything it's not a

3979.44 --> 3982.88
doorway it's not a piece of technology

3982.0 --> 3986.559
it's not

3982.88 --> 3986.559
two separate things

3986.64 --> 3993.359
that are connected flat on each other no

3990.16 --> 3997.0389999999998
it's continual

3993.359 --> 4000.4
and where before there was no connection

3997.039 --> 4002.48
you just move in on yourself

4000.4 --> 4005.119
right at the north you move in on

4002.48 --> 4008.2400000000002
yourself you can

4005.119 --> 4009.2000000000003
you just look back to where you were and

4008.24 --> 4012.319
then suddenly

4009.2 --> 4016.24
the gates open and there is a movement

4012.319 --> 4021.2
through suddenly you can pass through it

4016.24 --> 4024.24
the connection is open

4021.2 --> 4028.16
it's it's not an

4024.24 --> 4028.9599999999996
object or a boundary it's literally how

4028.16 --> 4035.839
space

4028.96 --> 4035.839
itself connects

4037.119 --> 4040.7200000000003
but anyway thank you for the question

4041.44 --> 4050.319
technical question i like it

4048.64 --> 4054.319
are the loops dynamic and change

4050.319 --> 4057.599
location or are they static

4054.319 --> 4058.48
well that's a big part of the whole

4057.599 --> 4062.7200000000003
puzzle

4058.48 --> 4065.76
isn't it right

4062.72 --> 4069.5989999999997
it's probably static it's

4065.76 --> 4072.7990000000004
probably not connecting and opening up

4069.599 --> 4075.92
the thing is though it might

4072.799 --> 4077.68
because once you have looping elements

4075.92 --> 4082.079
within available space

4077.68 --> 4085.359
as part of a standard design for a realm

4082.079 --> 4088.4
then to move beyond that and just create

4085.359 --> 4090.64
connections even varying connections

4088.4 --> 4092.1600000000003
would seem like a little step to take as

4090.64 --> 4094.799
a designer

4092.16 --> 4095.5989999999997
in contrast to is if there was no

4094.799 --> 4098.56
special

4095.599 --> 4100.799
loop dynamic going on whatsoever and it

4098.56 --> 4103.279
would all have to be euclidean

4100.799 --> 4105.5199999999995
literally as is and then be surrounded

4103.279 --> 4110.319
by of course a dome

4105.52 --> 4112.0
physically yeah then there is no way

4110.319 --> 4114.799
that there could be a connection to

4112.0 --> 4117.199
another realm you see

4114.799 --> 4119.44
then you'd only be ever connected to

4117.199 --> 4123.678999999999
whatever is available within the

4119.44 --> 4126.879999999999
the non-varying available volume right

4123.679 --> 4128.96
that's really what that's about

4126.88 --> 4131.04
if there's a special loop situation

4128.96 --> 4133.44
happening if the earth is

4131.04 --> 4135.679
roughly rectangular looping yeah then

4133.44 --> 4136.4
all kinds of possibilities might roll

4135.679 --> 4139.52
out of that

4136.4 --> 4147.839
as to how it could turn out to be

4139.52 --> 4147.839000000001
and there's ways of figuring that out

4156.159 --> 4162.4
changing times and laws in scripture

4158.799 --> 4162.4
what are you talking about michael khan

4167.359 --> 4174.96
does looping kill the dome yes

4170.799 --> 4177.2789999999995
absolutely there is no dome

4174.96 --> 4179.04
if the earth is rectangular looping

4177.279 --> 4183.040000000001
because if there is one loop

4179.04 --> 4187.44
that means there is no touchdown

4183.04 --> 4191.759
of an enclosure within that part

4187.44 --> 4193.678999999999
right so but depending again on the

4191.759 --> 4196.88
actual spatial dynamics of

4193.679 --> 4200.0
where are the loops is the loop only

4196.88 --> 4202.8
in one axis or is it in two

4200.0 --> 4203.52
axes or is it in all axes you don't know

4202.8 --> 4206.0
right

4203.52 --> 4207.84
so what could potentially turn out to be

4206.0 --> 4210.719
and this was also

4207.84 --> 4211.28
expressed through this the cgi animation

4210.719 --> 4213.36
that

4211.28 --> 4214.8
square earth cosmology made all those

4213.36 --> 4217.679
years ago

4214.8 --> 4219.04
is that it's a rectangular looping thing

4217.679 --> 4222.8
east to west

4219.04 --> 4226.32
and then there is a tube dome

4222.8 --> 4230.400000000001
over it like a tube like a train station

4226.32 --> 4233.759999999999
tunnel so that there might be

4230.4 --> 4236.48
a tube like dome over that

4233.76 --> 4237.280000000001
that could be possible if the spatial

4236.48 --> 4240.799999999999
loop is

4237.28 --> 4242.84
only on one axis right because then the

4240.8 --> 4244.320000000001
tunnel would also be part of the

4242.84 --> 4246.719
continuity

4244.32 --> 4248.0
the dome itself the tunnel dome would be

4246.719 --> 4252.08
a part of the

4248.0 --> 4252.08
off the loop continuity you see

4253.6 --> 4261.120000000001
but yeah as far as a literal

4258.12 --> 4261.5199999999995
demisphere physical dome surrounding

4261.12 --> 4265.5199999999995
yeah

4261.52 --> 4270.320000000001
that cannot be if there is a loop

4265.52 --> 4270.320000000001
within the space that can't be is

4270.84 --> 4276.96
impossible

4272.88 --> 4280.719
unless it gets even freaking weirder

4276.96 --> 4284.08
and the dome is forever out of reach

4280.719 --> 4285.679
because now things get really [ __ ]

4284.08 --> 4288.719
weird

4285.679 --> 4290.56
it really does i'll try to draw it now

4288.719 --> 4294.08
we're going to go into even heavier

4290.56 --> 4300.88
spatial dynamics complexities

4294.08 --> 4304.0
right so

4300.88 --> 4306.4800000000005
oh god it's so asymmetrical that's just

4304.0 --> 4306.48
terrible

4312.159 --> 4315.5199999999995
right in a way i've already drawn this

4314.88 --> 4319.1990000000005
by the way

4315.52 --> 4319.1990000000005
but i just didn't emphasize it

4326.08 --> 4332.719
right so imagine that the rectangular

4330.32 --> 4333.679
looping or oh god this is totally

4332.719 --> 4343.84
invisible

4333.679 --> 4343.84
let me redo that

4349.44 --> 4351.678999999999
uh

4354.08 --> 4360.64
come on

4357.84 --> 4362.1900000000005
i draw the worst of the worst circles

4360.64 --> 4363.76
sometimes

4362.19 --> 4365.678999999999
[Music]

4363.76 --> 4369.04
it's very typical because i've had

4365.679 --> 4371.1990000000005
drawing like literally

4369.04 --> 4373.28
everywhere throughout my name but every

4371.199 --> 4374.799999999999
time the first time i draw some kind of

4373.28 --> 4377.5199999999995
a bubble or a dome i

4374.8 --> 4379.6
always get it wrong and just glaringly

4377.52 --> 4382.159000000001
wrong it's so weird

4379.6 --> 4398.18
i never got it right the first time i

4382.159 --> 4401.389999999999
don't know why ah anyway

4398.18 --> 4401.39
[Music]

4403.52 --> 4408.080000000001
all right i didn't get it much better

4405.04 --> 4408.08
this time but at least

4409.52 --> 4416.080000000001
that's good enough to make my point

4412.719 --> 4416.08
sorry for taking so long

4421.28 --> 4426.08
yeah this one's definitely better than

4422.96 --> 4428.64
the other one

4426.08 --> 4428.64
okay

4438.84 --> 4441.84
uh

4454.239 --> 4458.159
okay that's terrible whatever it's clear

4456.64 --> 4460.2390000000005
enough

4458.159 --> 4462.639999999999
right so let's see yeah at least you can

4460.239 --> 4464.0
see it right so here we have a very

4462.64 --> 4466.08
rough little

4464.0 --> 4467.36
representation of the rectangular

4466.08 --> 4470.32
looping realm

4467.36 --> 4472.32
as we know as we would as i assume we

4470.32 --> 4475.36
would be knowing it

4472.32 --> 4478.48
it's looping right

4475.36 --> 4479.759999999999
east to west so literally there but now

4478.48 --> 4484.4
zoom out

4479.76 --> 4487.52
guess what it's under the dome

4484.4 --> 4489.36
but you could never get to the dome it's

4487.52 --> 4491.1990000000005
there though but it's like forever out

4489.36 --> 4494.32
of reach because you loop in

4491.199 --> 4497.678999999999
on yourself before you could ever

4494.32 --> 4499.12
get to the actual physical proximity of

4497.679 --> 4501.76
the dome

4499.12 --> 4504.48
right that is another potential

4501.76 --> 4504.4800000000005
possibility

4504.96 --> 4512.719
if there is a loop within space

4508.32 --> 4514.96
dude once spatial dynamics

4512.719 --> 4515.92
becomes a real thing it turns out to be

4514.96 --> 4519.12
real the

4515.92 --> 4522.84
the things that can come out of that are

4519.12 --> 4524.64
literally mind-boggling literally

4522.84 --> 4528.159000000001
mind-boggling

4524.64 --> 4531.1990000000005
right like i'm just touching upon

4528.159 --> 4533.679
a few of the possibilities

4531.199 --> 4534.48
because hey if god's really in the

4533.679 --> 4537.52
designer

4534.48 --> 4539.759999999999
really took a hold of that

4537.52 --> 4542.56
he would have set things up in a way

4539.76 --> 4543.280000000001
that i that would just so blow my mind i

4542.56 --> 4545.6
would never

4543.28 --> 4547.759999999999
i would literally at some point if i got

4545.6 --> 4550.159000000001
close to understanding it

4547.76 --> 4550.8
i'd give up because it became too much

4550.159 --> 4555.5199999999995
to me

4550.8 --> 4558.56
it became too much to bear serious

4555.52 --> 4567.84
that's how complex it could really turn

4558.56 --> 4567.84
out to be

4568.4 --> 4573.839999999999
all right michael khan i'll see you

4570.08 --> 4573.84
later thanks for being in chat

4574.32 --> 4578.639999999999
do we loops always reconnect to the same

4578.84 --> 4584.4800000000005
realm

4581.36 --> 4587.5199999999995
the loop is the connection

4584.48 --> 4590.718999999999
on itself but as i said

4587.52 --> 4590.719
the loop can also

4592.239 --> 4600.32
top down view connect

4595.84 --> 4600.32
to some other realm segment

4600.48 --> 4604.879999999999
so if there is any loop connection

4602.719 --> 4607.6
opening possibility

4604.88 --> 4608.0
if it would be anywhere ever within the

4607.6 --> 4610.2390000000005
realm

4608.0 --> 4611.04
set up as we've currently identified it

4610.239 --> 4615.04
it would be

4611.04 --> 4617.76
north and south bridges that could

4615.04 --> 4619.04
temporarily open or maybe they are there

4617.76 --> 4620.719
all the time

4619.04 --> 4622.08
right and then that would suggest kind

4620.719 --> 4624.96
of the the beads

4622.08 --> 4627.04
model it would be like there's a realm

4624.96 --> 4628.0
and it connects to another realm but the

4627.04 --> 4629.679
connection

4628.0 --> 4631.52
if you actually want to reach there you

4629.679 --> 4634.32
have to go dead center

4631.52 --> 4637.360000000001
you would have to move dead center or

4634.32 --> 4640.639999999999
you would loop back in on yourself

4637.36 --> 4642.88
and then end up where you started

4640.64 --> 4645.76
you have to go dead center north or

4642.88 --> 4648.88
south and then perhaps

4645.76 --> 4652.0
if there is a continual spatial loop

4648.88 --> 4654.0
opening there and probably if there

4652.0 --> 4657.84
would be any it would be there

4654.0 --> 4657.84
then you might move on to the other

4661.19 --> 4667.919999999999
[Music]

4663.76 --> 4667.92
all segment so thanks for the

4668.4 --> 4674.159
integral questions there steamy traveler

4670.719 --> 4674.159
i really appreciate that

4677.28 --> 4683.12
no george sanford no it doesn't

4680.8 --> 4685.92
absolutely doesn't it's the dumbest

4683.12 --> 4685.92
thing i've ever heard

4688.08 --> 4692.4
seriously it's the dumbest thing i've

4690.08 --> 4695.12
ever heard i'm i i get it

4692.4 --> 4697.199
i get that people do it but every time

4695.12 --> 4700.8
somebody says

4697.199 --> 4701.599999999999
it's hitting the water the water it's

4700.8 --> 4703.76
like

4701.6 --> 4704.96
immediately like yeah you're a freaking

4703.76 --> 4707.04
fantasist

4704.96 --> 4708.56
you are a fan you literally don't know

4707.04 --> 4710.08
what the [ __ ] you're saying it's the

4708.56 --> 4712.2390000000005
dumbest [ __ ] ever

4710.08 --> 4715.04
and especially if you're gonna conclude

4712.239 --> 4718.159
it from some spectacle

4715.04 --> 4720.8
from freaking nasa or related

4718.159 --> 4721.44
you know you can't be seriously saying

4720.8 --> 4725.84
that that's

4721.44 --> 4735.839999999999
actually supposedly getting in the water

4725.84 --> 4735.84
come on

4740.239 --> 4743.28
can't be serious man

4744.64 --> 4748.08
there is no proof that you can even hit

4747.44 --> 4751.04
this

4748.08 --> 4752.08
thing that you could actually get enough

4751.04 --> 4754.719
momentum to

4752.08 --> 4755.84
actually hit it where's the proof there

4754.719 --> 4760.08
is no proof

4755.84 --> 4760.08
there's no proof that it should be

4760.84 --> 4763.84
possible

4773.6 --> 4782.159000000001
right and and well this 20

4777.28 --> 4783.28
25 december 2070 spacex

4782.159 --> 4785.28
i don't know which one you're

4783.28 --> 4786.88
specifically talking about but if you

4785.28 --> 4788.08
are echoing the same thing that i

4786.88 --> 4790.400000000001
remember from that time

4788.08 --> 4791.36
it was like oh look the rocket is

4790.4 --> 4794.639999999999
entering some

4791.36 --> 4796.4
new layer and look it almost looks like

4794.64 --> 4800.8
it's rippling water

4796.4 --> 4805.12
that's nothing that's all [ __ ]

4800.8 --> 4808.0
it's not water

4805.12 --> 4808.0
it's ridiculous

4811.92 --> 4816.08
sure yeah but i'll take a look at the

4813.6 --> 4819.280000000001
video link

4816.08 --> 4820.32
sure i'll go through that it's i

4819.28 --> 4824.159
guarantee it

4820.32 --> 4833.84
like whatever it reminds you of it's not

4824.159 --> 4833.839999999999
water above

4835.36 --> 4847.839999999999
and especially if you suggest that you

4837.36 --> 4847.839999999999
could go into that

4858.84 --> 4861.84
so

4878.0 --> 4882.159
you're trying very hard to get out or

4881.12 --> 4885.76
they're just

4882.159 --> 4885.759999999999
making you believe

4886.239 --> 4891.839999999999
there's all kinds of things there that

4888.719 --> 4891.84
aren't actually there

4897.92 --> 4904.4800000000005
dude you know what i think

4901.04 --> 4909.76
i think nasa is doing their

4904.48 --> 4913.28
utmost best to convince the entire world

4909.76 --> 4916.88
that the earth is very specifically

4913.28 --> 4919.84
flat and a disk and domed

4916.88 --> 4920.2390000000005
and perhaps i guess water above i think

4919.84 --> 4923.4800000000005
they're

4920.239 --> 4925.678999999999
literally trying to enforce that

4923.48 --> 4929.04
presuppositional setup

4925.679 --> 4931.36
to cement it in our minds

4929.04 --> 4932.159
as we are fighting free against the

4931.36 --> 4935.44
globe

4932.159 --> 4938.879999999999
they are actively engaging in cementing

4935.44 --> 4941.36
a new model in our minds

4938.88 --> 4942.88
by denying it and then through their

4941.36 --> 4946.32
trickery suggest

4942.88 --> 4950.88
exactly that very specifically

4946.32 --> 4953.92
that that nonsense that nonsense model

4950.88 --> 4957.12
[ __ ] literal water above a

4953.92 --> 4958.56
literal dome that you would hit bunk one

4957.12 --> 4962.0
time another time oh you go

4958.56 --> 4966.56
through it and then oh yeah it's water

4962.0 --> 4966.56
sure yeah

4970.84 --> 4973.84
right

4976.32 --> 4981.199
like how does that all of that even

4979.04 --> 4984.96
coincide

4981.199 --> 4988.96
with operation fish boil bowl

4984.96 --> 4992.4800000000005
if there was water above that a rocket

4988.96 --> 4992.4800000000005
could go into

4992.88 --> 4996.88
what do you think would happen if you

4995.28 --> 4999.5199999999995
then shot a whole bunch of

4996.88 --> 5001.1990000000005
nukes or rockets with big booms whatever

4999.52 --> 5004.88
the [ __ ] they are

5001.199 --> 5007.36
up there against the fishbowl

5004.88 --> 5008.08
what would happen if there was water up

5007.36 --> 5010.159
there

5008.08 --> 5011.76
actually in which a rocket could

5010.159 --> 5014.159
physically move into

5011.76 --> 5016.56
what do you think would happen when you

5014.159 --> 5019.92
send a record amount of explosives

5016.56 --> 5021.52
giant explosives up there in that water

5019.92 --> 5024.2390000000005
and blow it up

5021.52 --> 5025.52
you think we'd all be breathing here or

5024.239 --> 5028.638999999999
you think we'd all be

5025.52 --> 5031.52
floating don't be

5028.639 --> 5031.52
ridiculous

5036.8 --> 5040.8
there is no water up there in which you

5040.4 --> 5043.839999999999
can

5040.8 --> 5043.84
physically move

5052.4 --> 5058.96
right but they stir

5055.52 --> 5060.56
sure want to make you fantasize that

5058.96 --> 5064.159
that is what you're looking at

5060.56 --> 5066.400000000001
don't they don't they ever thought about

5064.159 --> 5066.4
that

5067.28 --> 5070.48
you know when nasa and spacex does

5069.679 --> 5073.679
things

5070.48 --> 5077.839999999999
you gotta realize they're not

5073.679 --> 5080.88
trying to convince you of their

5077.84 --> 5084.400000000001
globe model no

5080.88 --> 5089.12
what they're actually doing is trying to

5084.4 --> 5093.759999999999
program you on how to deny it

5089.12 --> 5097.679
and what to latch on to instead

5093.76 --> 5101.04
without you realizing it

5097.679 --> 5102.56
that's what they do because if they were

5101.04 --> 5106.08
trying to convince you

5102.56 --> 5109.159000000001
of the actual globe model heliocentrism

5106.08 --> 5113.76
they wouldn't be brutally

5109.159 --> 5117.28
kindergarten level mocking up constantly

5113.76 --> 5120.08
now they do that to force you out of it

5117.28 --> 5121.44
and then they guide you within the

5120.08 --> 5123.5199999999995
fantasy

5121.44 --> 5125.36
as you think they are your opponents

5123.52 --> 5126.719
they're trying to hide it from you and

5125.36 --> 5130.159
guess what they'll drop

5126.719 --> 5131.44
every hint you need to solidify to

5130.159 --> 5134.799999999999
cement

5131.44 --> 5138.719
that specific model thing that they

5134.8 --> 5142.4800000000005
are set out to convince you of yeah

5138.719 --> 5145.76
the disc the dome the physical

5142.48 --> 5147.36
literal flat earth model thing that's

5145.76 --> 5148.08
really popular and so many people

5147.36 --> 5150.08
believe in

5148.08 --> 5151.28
i think that's what literally nasa is

5150.08 --> 5153.84
there to enforce

5151.28 --> 5155.759999999999
not heliocentrism because everything

5153.84 --> 5156.08
that's heliocentrism related that they

5155.76 --> 5159.76
do

5156.08 --> 5159.76
is a total screw-up

5165.44 --> 5169.839999999999
so i'll let you ponder on that george

5167.44 --> 5169.839999999999
sanford

5178.88 --> 5184.74
[Music]

5195.04 --> 5200.88
right what better programming

5198.88 --> 5202.8
than programming you don't know is

5200.88 --> 5203.52
programming because you're preoccupied

5202.8 --> 5207.1990000000005
by some

5203.52 --> 5211.1990000000005
other more obvious programming

5207.199 --> 5213.28
that's also accompanied with it remotely

5211.199 --> 5216.08
when you're expecting that programming

5213.28 --> 5218.0
then you don't expect the programming

5216.08 --> 5219.44
that they're actually programming you

5218.0 --> 5225.28
with

5219.44 --> 5239.839999999999
that's how programming works

5225.28 --> 5239.84
otherwise it'd just be education

5264.84 --> 5267.84
so

5274.4 --> 5280.239
right any feedback guys i'd appreciate

5278.159 --> 5281.839999999999
some activity in chat not just the

5280.239 --> 5284.32
trolls and people

5281.84 --> 5286.56
talking to the trolls and laughing at

5284.32 --> 5288.32
their stupid jokes

5286.56 --> 5290.719
how about some actual in-contact

5288.32 --> 5292.84
feedback i just gave you a whole bunch

5290.719 --> 5295.679
of

5292.84 --> 5298.159000000001
really compacted information

5295.679 --> 5299.84
it would be great to have some feedback

5298.159 --> 5301.679
to actually get the sense

5299.84 --> 5303.04
like i'm talking to people that are

5301.679 --> 5306.32
listening and not just

5303.04 --> 5307.96
hanging around to hear somebody blabber

5306.32 --> 5311.17
yeah that would be great

5307.96 --> 5311.17
[Music]

5334.84 --> 5337.84
so

5348.84 --> 5351.84
uh

5352.0 --> 5356.4
all right i'm definitely gonna title

5353.84 --> 5356.400000000001
this one

5357.44 --> 5365.839999999999
probably gonna watch it back

5377.92 --> 5381.6
but it would be great if somebody

5380.48 --> 5384.638999999999
actually

5381.6 --> 5384.639
spoke up in chat

5387.679 --> 5393.84
as in yes it's getting on my nerves guys

5425.44 --> 5435.839999999999
about the water what how does that make

5428.4 --> 5435.839999999999
any sense tiny bumble

5438.639 --> 5442.08
they are hardly trying to trick anyone

5440.719 --> 5444.8
about what is above

5442.08 --> 5446.48
are they really is that a question or is

5444.8 --> 5448.56
that a statement

5446.48 --> 5451.28
because i just explained to you how they

5448.56 --> 5451.280000000001
would do that

5451.679 --> 5456.96
right so they tell you this is how it is

5455.04 --> 5458.88
that is how it is oh we can't go back

5456.96 --> 5461.36
because we lost the technology blah blah

5458.88 --> 5465.12
all that all heliocentric

5461.36 --> 5468.32
[ __ ] bad excuses

5465.12 --> 5470.96
easily unraveled lies

5468.32 --> 5471.36
right but then in the practical things

5470.96 --> 5476.4
they

5471.36 --> 5478.88
they do these weird projects like what

5476.4 --> 5480.879999999999
what george sanford brought up send a

5478.88 --> 5483.84
rocket up there and then suddenly oh

5480.88 --> 5485.04
it's what's happening all this weird

5483.84 --> 5488.08
sighting and it's like

5485.04 --> 5491.6
light or is it going into the why

5488.08 --> 5494.0
would they do that if not to get

5491.6 --> 5495.04
everybody just talking about it and look

5494.0 --> 5496.96
what came out of it

5495.04 --> 5498.56
a whole bunch of people are now calling

5496.96 --> 5501.84
it oh that's where it hit

5498.56 --> 5503.280000000001
the waters above right well isn't that

5501.84 --> 5506.4800000000005
then exactly what they

5503.28 --> 5506.48
tried to achieve with it

5513.199 --> 5518.159
how about what see now now you see it

5515.6 --> 5521.4400000000005
again hello martin

5518.159 --> 5522.239
yatsem liquid hydrogen and helium in

5521.44 --> 5525.44
heavens

5522.239 --> 5528.879999999999
oh really a liquid you say so

5525.44 --> 5528.879999999999
how is that staying up there

5530.08 --> 5537.5199999999995
how does that work and how is it staying

5534.32 --> 5540.0
liquid and not turning to gas and

5537.52 --> 5541.92
expanding all directions and staying up

5540.0 --> 5546.0
there and

5541.92 --> 5548.2390000000005
how does that work it makes so much more

5546.0 --> 5550.4
sense well it would make sense except

5548.239 --> 5553.36
that not if they were liquid

5550.4 --> 5555.759999999999
that wouldn't make any damn sense at all

5553.36 --> 5555.759999999999
at all

5556.96 --> 5560.4800000000005
because yeah when something is liquid

5559.28 --> 5563.599999999999
it's more dense

5560.48 --> 5564.32
and then relative density is going to

5563.6 --> 5568.08
make it go

5564.32 --> 5570.4
down so how is it staying up there

5568.08 --> 5573.04
how is any liquid supposedly going to

5570.4 --> 5573.04
stay up there

5573.36 --> 5581.28
there is no system

5577.36 --> 5584.639
that makes that make any sense at all

5581.28 --> 5586.96
zero no flat earth thing

5584.639 --> 5588.639
no global there is nothing that makes

5586.96 --> 5592.639
that make any sense

5588.639 --> 5596.08
low temperature oh so a low temperature

5592.639 --> 5600.0
is going to keep the liquid

5596.08 --> 5602.96
up there is it can you demonstrate that

5600.0 --> 5603.92
on a smaller scale how that would work

5602.96 --> 5607.679
let me show you

5603.92 --> 5610.719
keep a liquid up somewhere

5607.679 --> 5610.719
using temperature

5611.36 --> 5618.48
without a barrier over hanging over

5615.6 --> 5620.719
gases yeah let me show let me show me

5618.48 --> 5620.718999999999
this

5621.679 --> 5625.4400000000005
fluid not liquid oh so it isn't the

5624.56 --> 5629.120000000001
liquid then

5625.44 --> 5632.239
it's a gas so it's a gas

5629.12 --> 5634.48
right well a liquid is

5632.239 --> 5635.5199999999995
liquid and a gas is a gas and fluid can

5634.48 --> 5638.32
be both

5635.52 --> 5638.320000000001
but you said

5638.8 --> 5646.2390000000005
liquid liquid hydrogen and helium

5642.719 --> 5659.12
not fluid hydrogen helium why would you

5646.239 --> 5660.879999999999
even call it that

5659.12 --> 5663.36
no steaming traveler i'm not even gonna

5660.88 --> 5663.36
go there

5663.92 --> 5670.4800000000005
bubbles in water what the hell that's

5667.44 --> 5674.48
in a swimming pool buddy

5670.48 --> 5679.678999999999
there is no thing up there

5674.48 --> 5679.678999999999
there's nothing up there did you get it

5680.4 --> 5684.839999999999
oh sent a little help thank you very

5683.6 --> 5687.92
much

5684.84 --> 5690.719
god i can use that thank you

5687.92 --> 5690.719
i will check it

5697.28 --> 5701.5199999999995
yes thank you very much man thank you

5699.92 --> 5715.84
julia pavin

5701.52 --> 5715.84
really uh really appreciate that

5717.28 --> 5720.88
yeah that'll keep me going

5721.679 --> 5726.88
for the next two days thank you very

5724.639 --> 5730.08
much

5726.88 --> 5733.76
all right so yeah bubbles in water

5730.08 --> 5734.4
that's not because the iss or whatever

5733.76 --> 5738.0
thing

5734.4 --> 5739.679
is literally up there in water you can't

5738.0 --> 5741.52
be seriously thinking that

5739.679 --> 5743.679
no it's because it's in a freaking

5741.52 --> 5746.88
swimming pool somewhere

5743.679 --> 5750.08
with a fish eye lens the earth

5746.88 --> 5752.639
basically black photoshopped in the

5750.08 --> 5752.639
background

5753.119 --> 5757.28
as a backdrop because it's actually in

5756.08 --> 5759.679
the water

5757.28 --> 5760.88
that's why you see bubbles it's not

5759.679 --> 5764.56
because they are

5760.88 --> 5764.88
up there in water there is no station up

5764.56 --> 5771.84
there

5764.88 --> 5771.84
in water that's ridiculous come on

5774.96 --> 5780.32
not with hydrogen helium have we been

5777.92 --> 5780.32
out there

5783.04 --> 5786.08
well i'm not denying there's hydrogen

5784.96 --> 5788.8
and helium up there

5786.08 --> 5791.679
that's logic it's only logical because

5788.8 --> 5796.0
of relative density it's not

5791.679 --> 5799.1990000000005
liquid no it's not liquid

5796.0 --> 5799.679
like i could imagine that like there

5799.199 --> 5802.0
might

5799.679 --> 5803.36
be some kind of weird state that because

5802.0 --> 5808.48
of extreme cold up there

5803.36 --> 5808.48
who knows maybe there are like helium

5808.96 --> 5812.56
hydrogen whatever like clouds or

5811.76 --> 5815.360000000001
something

5812.56 --> 5816.4800000000005
at some point right just like moist

5815.36 --> 5819.04
moist

5816.48 --> 5821.04
water is like liquid at ground it

5819.04 --> 5822.88
evaporates but then at some point

5821.04 --> 5824.88
because of the temperature

5822.88 --> 5827.1990000000005
it becomes droplets again and then

5824.88 --> 5830.2390000000005
manages to hang around

5827.199 --> 5834.159
right so maybe maybe

5830.239 --> 5836.159
maybe maybe maybe way up there way

5834.159 --> 5838.239
beyond anything we could ever see with

5836.159 --> 5839.759999999999
our eyes or any telescope because it

5838.239 --> 5840.0
would be too much in between maybe at

5839.76 --> 5844.400000000001
some

5840.0 --> 5847.36
point it gets so cold that

5844.4 --> 5848.799999999999
helium would kind of sort of become

5847.36 --> 5850.4
liquid again

5848.8 --> 5852.400000000001
and then normally of course relative

5850.4 --> 5853.92
density will bring it down

5852.4 --> 5855.599999999999
and then it will become gas again so it

5853.92 --> 5857.679
keeps kind of back and forth

5855.6 --> 5860.08
something like that but it would be

5857.679 --> 5861.76
rather like a cloud situation so maybe

5860.08 --> 5863.84
there's just gas and then at some point

5861.76 --> 5867.280000000001
there's a cloud

5863.84 --> 5870.0
where it kind of is mixed liquid form

5867.28 --> 5871.28
with just gaseous form surrounding it

5870.0 --> 5876.0
who knows maybe like

5871.28 --> 5880.08
against the dome there are like clouds

5876.0 --> 5882.48
of helium just speculating you know if

5880.08 --> 5884.639
it can happen with water closer to

5882.48 --> 5887.599999999999
ground then who knows what it

5884.639 --> 5888.32
may that same effect may happen with the

5887.6 --> 5890.96
extremely

5888.32 --> 5891.84
low density gases up there if they get

5890.96 --> 5894.2390000000005
cold enough

5891.84 --> 5895.04
it's it's a possibility in my opinion

5894.239 --> 5897.28
mechanically

5895.04 --> 5900.4
not saying there is i'm just saying that

5897.28 --> 5900.4
might be possible

5902.239 --> 5906.799999999999
but it's not going to be like an ocean

5904.88 --> 5909.28
it's not just going to be a full

5906.8 --> 5910.96
liquid body that makes no sense because

5909.28 --> 5911.5199999999995
that would be subjected to relative

5910.96 --> 5915.84
density

5911.52 --> 5919.360000000001
and sploosh it would all come down

5915.84 --> 5921.360000000001
once the mass of it overcomes the

5919.36 --> 5923.199
surface tension of it

5921.36 --> 5925.28
if there's enough liquid gathered it

5923.199 --> 5927.839999999999
would just come down like that

5925.28 --> 5929.92
doesn't matter what type of liquid it is

5927.84 --> 5932.4800000000005
even if it is like liquid helium

5929.92 --> 5933.76
right so it would more likely just end

5932.48 --> 5936.08
up like a

5933.76 --> 5938.0
mixed cloud-like situation with just

5936.08 --> 5942.0
droplets kind of

5938.0 --> 5945.44
hanging on hanging on a certain height

5942.0 --> 5945.44
just like the clouds out here

5948.48 --> 5954.4
and i'm just speculating about this

5951.6 --> 5957.119000000001
i see it as a potential possibility not

5954.4 --> 5957.119
saying it is

5958.239 --> 5962.0
one thing that is absolutely not

5960.159 --> 5962.96
possible though is that there is a

5962.0 --> 5967.119
literal

5962.96 --> 5970.719
connected ocean of any sort of liquid

5967.119 --> 5976.08
literally up there and staying in place

5970.719 --> 5976.08
that's impossible pretty much no matter

5978.84 --> 5981.84
what

5982.719 --> 5989.679
no martin judson no you're just

5986.0 --> 5989.679
wild defantasizing now

5992.56 --> 5997.84
fluid not liquid yeah dude hey i'm

5995.52 --> 6001.52
talking about this subject yeah

5997.84 --> 6004.08
i don't care if you think fluid

6001.52 --> 6006.2390000000005
yeah which basically means oh not liquid

6004.08 --> 6009.36
oh so then you mean gas

6006.239 --> 6013.28
yeah there's two forms of fluid liquid

6009.36 --> 6016.88
gas fluid liquid gas

6013.28 --> 6019.44
not liquid then gas

6016.88 --> 6020.159000000001
that's it that's the only option if it's

6019.44 --> 6023.599999999999
a fluid

6020.159 --> 6028.4
and it's not a liquid then it is a gas

6023.6 --> 6030.0
okay not a liquid

6028.4 --> 6031.5199999999995
and it doesn't matter what it if if you

6030.0 --> 6032.719
could call it the fluid it's just going

6031.52 --> 6035.84
to be gas then

6032.719 --> 6037.04
if it's not a liquid right there's only

6035.84 --> 6039.1990000000005
two forms of fluid

6037.04 --> 6040.159
liquid gas it's not a liquid then it's a

6039.199 --> 6050.0
gas

6040.159 --> 6052.48
no point in calling it a fluid

6050.0 --> 6055.44
super fluid helium i don't what the hell

6052.48 --> 6055.44
is that supposed to be

6058.4 --> 6062.239
so is there any super fluid helium in

6060.639 --> 6063.6
nature

6062.239 --> 6065.759999999999
because that sounds like it's an

6063.6 --> 6068.400000000001
artificially

6065.76 --> 6068.400000000001
made thing

6072.32 --> 6075.599999999999
is plasma a fluid

6077.44 --> 6086.96
that's a googlable question

6082.159 --> 6086.96
is plasma a fluid

6088.239 --> 6093.839999999999
plasma is a fluid actually okay

6091.679 --> 6093.84
right

6095.76 --> 6103.1990000000005
so but i take it he wasn't suggesting

6099.52 --> 6106.2390000000005
that there was plasma

6103.199 --> 6106.879999999999
hydrogen and helium because that would

6106.239 --> 6111.36
actually

6106.88 --> 6113.1990000000005
require extreme extreme energy

6111.36 --> 6115.28
to maintain because it's not a natural

6113.199 --> 6117.5199999999995
state so if it's cold up there

6115.28 --> 6119.5199999999995
or really it's cold up there but it's

6117.52 --> 6122.639
going to be in plasmic state no i'm

6119.52 --> 6122.639
pretty sure he meant

6124.96 --> 6135.84
he didn't mean plasma even though it

6127.199 --> 6135.839999999999
might be mechanically possible to create

6143.28 --> 6150.88
below its boiling point

6148.0 --> 6152.639
below it's so that's just fluid that

6150.88 --> 6156.159000000001
that's just

6152.639 --> 6157.84
in a fluid state then i don't know how

6156.159 --> 6161.04
that's super fluid that's just the

6157.84 --> 6164.400000000001
liquid state basically

6161.04 --> 6167.5199999999995
below boiling point that means liquid

6164.4 --> 6169.119
below boiling point is liquid that's the

6167.52 --> 6172.639
point of boiling

6169.119 --> 6174.5599999999995
it's a transition from liquid to gas

6172.639 --> 6176.2390000000005
so if it's below boiling point that

6174.56 --> 6181.04
means liquid

6176.239 --> 6181.04
you can call it superfluid it's liquid

6188.239 --> 6191.839999999999
right but that does sound weird though

6219.6 --> 6224.4800000000005
right but yeah sure dude helium in its

6223.199 --> 6228.48
liquid form might be

6224.48 --> 6230.718999999999
very uh weird you know

6228.48 --> 6232.08
could be man there's so many different

6230.719 --> 6234.4
materials that in

6232.08 --> 6236.88
certain types of unusual state it

6234.4 --> 6247.839999999999
behaves very weird there's a lot of that

6236.88 --> 6247.84
out there

6265.6 --> 6270.639
by the way you would really need one

6267.679 --> 6274.96
hell of a refrigerator

6270.639 --> 6289.84
to get like temperatures of minus 452

6274.96 --> 6289.84
degrees fahrenheit

6300.84 --> 6303.84
hmm

6310.96 --> 6315.36
whoa holy [ __ ] yeah man that's even

6313.52 --> 6319.040000000001
colder than liquid nitrogen

6315.36 --> 6321.199
and that's really insanely cold

6319.04 --> 6321.199
so

6322.8 --> 6326.56
that's going to require one hell of a

6328.84 --> 6331.84
refrigerator

6335.52 --> 6341.040000000001
superfluid is a thing right but you

6338.719 --> 6343.119
could just call it a liquid

6341.04 --> 6344.159
because that's technically what it is

6343.119 --> 6347.92
right it's an

6344.159 --> 6352.4
unusual liquid

6347.92 --> 6352.4
a state that doesn't typically arrive in

6356.84 --> 6359.84
nature

6364.4 --> 6369.04
why do they say you can't get colder

6366.96 --> 6372.4
than absolute zero

6369.04 --> 6375.28
because now here goes the theory of how

6372.4 --> 6377.119
temperature even works right temperature

6375.28 --> 6377.679
this is what i learned in physics stuck

6377.119 --> 6381.199
to me

6377.679 --> 6382.4800000000005
very easily temperature is the shaking

6381.199 --> 6386.638999999999
of molecules

6382.48 --> 6389.678999999999
and the shaking of molecules is the heat

6386.639 --> 6390.08
well by that standard the absolute zero

6389.679 --> 6392.4800000000005
point

6390.08 --> 6395.199
is where there is literally no more

6392.48 --> 6397.919999999999
molecular movement happening whatsoever

6395.199 --> 6398.4
literally zero all the molecular

6397.92 --> 6401.28
movement

6398.4 --> 6403.199
ceases so there's no more vibration

6401.28 --> 6406.4
which is what heat is

6403.199 --> 6408.32
and by that standard yeah it there is an

6406.4 --> 6415.839999999999
absolute zero it's that's what it's

6408.32 --> 6415.84
based on

6422.48 --> 6429.678999999999
that's what i learned right

6425.679 --> 6433.1990000000005
well it might get in theory

6429.679 --> 6434.639
hyper theory give me a niche again right

6433.199 --> 6436.96
i like to do that

6434.639 --> 6438.0
in hyper theory maybe there is a

6436.96 --> 6442.08
material

6438.0 --> 6445.76
that would not be perfectly motionless

6442.08 --> 6447.199
at that zero degree border

6445.76 --> 6450.2390000000005
because how do they come to the

6447.199 --> 6451.919999999999
conclusion because all the materials

6450.239 --> 6454.08
they tested all the materials they

6451.92 --> 6456.719
tested all

6454.08 --> 6457.5199999999995
went to zero vibration at that

6456.719 --> 6460.4
temperature

6457.52 --> 6462.719
now if there is another material that

6460.4 --> 6464.638999999999
doesn't get to zero at that temperature

6462.719 --> 6466.0
then it might turn out oh look we just

6464.639 --> 6471.28
figured out with this material

6466.0 --> 6474.48
the absolute zero is actually lower

6471.28 --> 6476.5599999999995
i might be possible but yeah it's based

6474.48 --> 6479.839999999999
on

6476.56 --> 6481.52
no more lowering of temperature

6479.84 --> 6483.52
from material the stopping of the

6481.52 --> 6486.4800000000005
vibration which is what the heat

6483.52 --> 6489.679
supposedly is

6486.48 --> 6491.599999999999
and yeah there is after a certain

6489.679 --> 6493.04
temperature level all materials

6491.6 --> 6494.88
completely stop

6493.04 --> 6498.48
that process and that's why they said

6494.88 --> 6501.76
okay this is the absolute zero

6498.48 --> 6503.5199999999995
we have no material to get it lower

6501.76 --> 6505.6
but who knows maybe they'll figure out

6503.52 --> 6509.040000000001
some material maybe they'll artificially

6505.6 --> 6510.88
make some material who knows

6509.04 --> 6513.84
what kind of chemistry developments

6510.88 --> 6513.84
there will be

6514.08 --> 6520.08
but yeah right now that is the absolute

6517.679 --> 6520.08
zero

6524.08 --> 6528.48
is there any upper temperature limit no

6530.239 --> 6536.48
but what is a natural consequence is

6533.76 --> 6541.679
that after certain temperatures material

6536.48 --> 6544.32
just disintegrates then it can't

6541.679 --> 6545.36
yeah it's broke like the the temperature

6544.32 --> 6547.36
can

6545.36 --> 6548.5599999999995
theoretically be unlimited i don't know

6547.36 --> 6551.119
how i can i can

6548.56 --> 6552.080000000001
technically get get it but it's

6551.119 --> 6554.96
basically

6552.08 --> 6556.239
the temperature limit is the point after

6554.96 --> 6558.159
which all material

6556.239 --> 6560.0
would absolutely irreversibly

6558.159 --> 6562.159
disintegrate

6560.0 --> 6563.199
that would be theoretically the maximum

6562.159 --> 6566.4
temperature but

6563.199 --> 6568.0
i don't think they ever reached that or

6566.4 --> 6571.679
were foolish enough to try because of

6568.0 --> 6571.679
course that's extremely dangerous

6572.0 --> 6576.239
right because this integration of

6574.08 --> 6576.88
material due to temperature usually

6576.239 --> 6581.5199999999995
comes with

6576.88 --> 6582.159000000001
explosion when material disintegrates it

6581.52 --> 6585.599
usually

6582.159 --> 6590.4
breaks up into less dense

6585.599 --> 6590.400000000001
material with more volume right so

6602.8 --> 6608.84
because of course as we all know

6604.8 --> 6611.84
temperature causes material to expand

6608.84 --> 6611.84
right

6625.44 --> 6631.919999999999
hey ironic 26 by the way

6628.8 --> 6631.92
super fluid thing

6632.08 --> 6639.84
frictionless can even go through glass

6635.199 --> 6639.839999999999
what what

6641.679 --> 6644.96
what are you talking about

6648.8 --> 6652.96
gas bubble suspended in honey

6660.0 --> 6667.76
right by the way glass is a fluid

6663.52 --> 6669.92
so yes technically things could

6667.76 --> 6671.92
technically things could sink through

6669.92 --> 6676.0
glass

6671.92 --> 6678.32
if it would have enough time it's weird

6676.0 --> 6680.08
that the idea that glass is technically

6678.32 --> 6683.679
liquid it's like a super slow

6680.08 --> 6683.679
liquid really weird stuff

6687.36 --> 6695.839999999999
what what is that

6697.36 --> 6700.96
oh superfluid helium

6702.639 --> 6710.56
whoa uh

6707.52 --> 6713.599
that just looks fluid to me

6710.56 --> 6717.04
it's just fluid how's that super

6713.599 --> 6717.04
it's it's just fluid

6719.28 --> 6725.679
i mean liquid sorry not

6722.32 --> 6728.32
it's just liquid that is liquid

6725.679 --> 6729.119
that link that video what they show is

6728.32 --> 6731.679
liquid it's

6729.119 --> 6737.839999999999
dripping now it's liquid it's liquid

6731.679 --> 6737.84
it's liquid it's liquid it's liquid

6740.88 --> 6743.92
oh that's interesting

6745.679 --> 6750.2390000000005
oh that's pretty fascinating what

6747.199 --> 6752.4
they're showing in this video

6750.239 --> 6754.879999999999
right so it's a liquid that indeed

6752.4 --> 6756.5599999999995
crawls right so it has apparently a lot

6754.88 --> 6761.119
of attachment to a surface

6756.56 --> 6764.320000000001
i think you could say that the capillary

6761.119 --> 6767.839999999999
working of liquid

6764.32 --> 6770.08
helium is extreme so you wouldn't even

6767.84 --> 6772.32
probably but it would be interesting

6770.08 --> 6772.96
though right so what is the capillary

6772.32 --> 6774.799999999999
working i

6772.96 --> 6776.0
i thought i was taught this in my

6774.8 --> 6778.08
goldsmithing

6776.0 --> 6779.92
because it's it's pragmatic we need to

6778.08 --> 6782.48
know that

6779.92 --> 6782.96
capillary working is where you have two

6782.48 --> 6787.36
very

6782.96 --> 6789.199
tight surfaces stuck together

6787.36 --> 6790.719
and then what you typically do is you

6789.199 --> 6793.919999999999
put a bit of solder on it

6790.719 --> 6794.639
you heat it and then you watch as the

6793.92 --> 6797.84
solder

6794.639 --> 6800.88
like it gets sucked

6797.84 --> 6802.32
into the tight space in between those

6800.88 --> 6803.92
two things that you were trying to

6802.32 --> 6807.679
solder together and

6803.92 --> 6810.8
even if you put the solder at the bottom

6807.679 --> 6813.36
it'll go up into it

6810.8 --> 6814.4800000000005
into the narrow thing because of the

6813.36 --> 6816.799999999999
capillary working

6814.48 --> 6817.759999999999
it gets sucked in there because that's

6816.8 --> 6821.28
what tight

6817.76 --> 6822.159000000001
really tight spaces do with certain

6821.28 --> 6825.28
liquids well

6822.159 --> 6828.48
i guess that this

6825.28 --> 6832.159
super fluid helium does that

6828.48 --> 6835.04
a lot so it would be extremely sensitive

6832.159 --> 6838.5599999999995
to that effect probably as it seems to

6835.04 --> 6843.199
well according to the video even like

6838.56 --> 6845.360000000001
move up aside a single surface and then

6843.199 --> 6846.239
kind of like spread around over it's

6845.36 --> 6848.719
weird

6846.239 --> 6850.239
so it seems to me what it reminds me of

6848.719 --> 6851.92
now that i'm seeing a physical

6850.239 --> 6853.119
demonstration thank you very much for

6851.92 --> 6856.08
the link

6853.119 --> 6858.48
reminds me a lot about the capillary

6856.08 --> 6858.48
working

6860.84 --> 6863.84
fascinating

6875.52 --> 6880.159000000001
a morphe is solid yeah but it's

6878.159 --> 6882.879999999999
considerably a liquid it's just not a

6880.159 --> 6886.32
traditional liquid

6882.88 --> 6889.119
it's liquid like custard right

6886.32 --> 6892.08
custard it's also arguable that's not

6889.119 --> 6892.08
exactly a liquid

6892.639 --> 6897.84
but it kind of is well glass is the same

6896.159 --> 6900.638999999999
so yeah you could argue it's not a

6897.84 --> 6905.84
liquid but yeah it kind of is

6900.639 --> 6905.84
it's just weird and very very slow

6906.239 --> 6911.598999999999
but amorphous yes that's right

6909.84 --> 6914.0
anyway that was kind of interesting

6911.599 --> 6916.96
thanks thanks for that link iron 26 i

6914.0 --> 6918.32
really appreciate that

6916.96 --> 6921.76
check it out people it's really

6918.32 --> 6925.119
interesting video very old

6921.76 --> 6927.76
is it 50s something like old

6925.119 --> 6928.32
black and white footage of them testing

6927.76 --> 6933.84
it

6928.32 --> 6933.84
very interesting thank you for that

6934.56 --> 6939.119000000001
no friction climbs the wall of the

6936.719 --> 6939.119
beaker

6939.599 --> 6942.8
i didn't say friction

6943.52 --> 6950.2390000000005
i said capillary working the ability

6947.04 --> 6954.239
to crawl into a

6950.239 --> 6956.08
tight space i think it might be related

6954.239 --> 6959.5199999999995
to that effect

6956.08 --> 6961.199
but extremely enhanced and that's

6959.52 --> 6962.8
i'm curious like hey did they test that

6961.199 --> 6964.4
did they test the capillary working did

6962.8 --> 6968.08
they take too tight

6964.4 --> 6968.4
tight things put it in there and see how

6968.08 --> 6971.36
the

6968.4 --> 6972.839999999999
liquid helium rockets up there that

6971.36 --> 6976.88
would be

6972.84 --> 6976.88
fascinating to see that

6977.119 --> 6981.28
and would confirm my theory that it is

6979.52 --> 6983.280000000001
basically happening because of

6981.28 --> 6985.04
something that definitely relates to the

6983.28 --> 6986.96
capillary working

6985.04 --> 6988.159
i hope i'm spelling that right by the

6986.96 --> 6990.08
way i'm literally

6988.159 --> 6993.839999999999
translating it from dutch i don't even

6990.08 --> 6993.84
know if the words the same in english

6994.56 --> 6997.76
capillary action

6998.159 --> 7006.48
yes i got it right awesome

7003.679 --> 7008.719
i love it when i get it right the first

7006.48 --> 7008.718999999999
time

7009.119 --> 7012.719
right but i'll show you i'll put the

7010.96 --> 7015.199
link for capillary working so you can

7012.719 --> 7015.199
look it up

7015.76 --> 7021.280000000001
and then i'm gonna round out the show

7018.239 --> 7023.199
man how that time has passed

7021.28 --> 7024.8
i really appreciate you guys especially

7023.199 --> 7026.719
the last half hour's been very

7024.8 --> 7029.4400000000005
interesting thank you for your input i

7026.719 --> 7030.08
thrive on your input that's why i can

7029.44 --> 7031.678999999999
get a little

7030.08 --> 7033.84
impatient sometimes when i'm just

7031.679 --> 7035.52
waiting five minutes and nobody's saying

7033.84 --> 7037.360000000001
anything

7035.52 --> 7038.639
that kind of can piss me off so i

7037.36 --> 7041.679
appreciate if you

7038.639 --> 7045.36
keep to the lesson

7041.679 --> 7048.4800000000005
and yeah because that gives me material

7045.36 --> 7050.32
to actually work on in the show and help

7048.48 --> 7054.159
inform people

7050.32 --> 7055.28
about things right so thanks everyone

7059.44 --> 7064.638999999999
very scientific this of scientific very

7062.08 --> 7066.8
about knowledge and mechanics this time

7064.639 --> 7069.28
so i'm probably going to watch it back

7066.8 --> 7071.28
