5.94 --> 37.24
foreign

7.33 --> 37.24
[Music]

45.079 --> 49.82
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

48.6 --> 53.28
bird number

49.82 --> 54.96
935 I'm your host Arwin and before we

53.28 --> 57.18
start the show please don't forget to

54.96 --> 59.34
share it on any platform you deem fit

57.18 --> 61.019999999999996
and if you haven't already subscribe to

59.34 --> 63.84
my channel and hit the Bell notification

61.02 --> 65.82000000000001
so you don't want to go live which is

63.84 --> 67.92
normally 1pm Amsterdam time in the

65.82 --> 70.38
weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam time in the

67.92 --> 72.54
weekend please also do support me

70.38 --> 74.39999999999999
through the PayPal patreon crypto wallet

72.54 --> 76.38000000000001

74.4 --> 79.43900000000001
join button

76.38 --> 82.19999999999999
that will be much appreciated

79.439 --> 85.22
right so story for starting up a little

82.2 --> 85.22
late I was kind of

85.619 --> 94.57900000000001
I couldn't stop watching a video

89.939 --> 94.579
that would email to me by Rob h

94.68 --> 100.82000000000001
then was

96.36 --> 100.82
yeah pretty mind-blowing and

101.04 --> 107.64
very

102.5 --> 109.979
revealing in reflection on what I have

107.64 --> 112.5
been attempting

109.979 --> 115.92
on this channel so far

112.5 --> 118.14
with confronting the idea of viruses oh

115.92 --> 122.06
this guy

118.14 --> 122.06
has certainly done his research

122.399 --> 127.159
well what's this channel called again uh

127.799 --> 133.02
space Busters

130.619 --> 134.7
I don't know where else he's at but this

133.02 --> 137.52
is on

134.7 --> 141.319
bit shoot

137.52 --> 141.31900000000002
just link you through right away

141.36 --> 144.8
it's about an hour long

145.68 --> 154.08
but there's been extensive research

150.54 --> 155.7
for this video like really extensive and

154.08 --> 159.36
quite

155.7 --> 162.29999999999998
mind-boggling as to things that I did

159.36 --> 166.22000000000003
not fully understand yet got a hint of

162.3 --> 166.22
how this was all placed together

169.14 --> 174.23899999999998
and making me realize that

172.68 --> 177.36
I

174.239 --> 180.98000000000002
had a good grip on

177.36 --> 180.98000000000002
how to approach this

181.62 --> 187.08
but still I didn't understand anything

183.84 --> 189.48
or like not everything about every

187.08 --> 191.64000000000001
aspect and this video has certainly

189.48 --> 195.06
deepened that

191.64 --> 197.7
right because I've already hinted before

195.06 --> 201.18
like everything they call a virus

197.7 --> 203.64
that is something it's just not a virus

201.18 --> 205.739
it's more like a

203.64 --> 208.5
this is too complicated so we're just

205.739 --> 211.31900000000002
gonna call it a virus

208.5 --> 214.86
because it roughly correlates with the

211.319 --> 216.06
setup and yeah that turns out to be very

214.86 --> 219.36
correct

216.06 --> 221.7
and there's given many details detailed

219.36 --> 223.86
examples with good visual backup

221.7 --> 226.819
representation

223.86 --> 226.81900000000002
in this video

233.22 --> 238.98
but yeah what it basically says is like

236.64 --> 241.55999999999997
no bacteria are technically not

238.98 --> 245.29899999999998
infectious either

241.56 --> 249.36
and that was and also a bit more

245.299 --> 251.939
in-depth research about Louis Pasteur

249.36 --> 254.72000000000003
and Koch

251.939 --> 254.72
and

255.599 --> 259.979
I might have heard it before and

257.88 --> 264.9
suppressed it

259.979 --> 269.28
but man like they were absolute frauds

264.9 --> 273.23999999999995
like no like not by misunderstanding on

269.28 --> 277.02
purpose like they they performed fraud

273.24 --> 279.72
medical fraud on purpose and and we're

277.02 --> 282.35999999999996
even eventually paid to

279.72 --> 284.16
it's it's really creepy to have it just

282.36 --> 286.139
laid out like that

284.16 --> 289.139
I might have had a hint of it before

286.139 --> 291.6
didn't really trust my source giving me

289.139 --> 293.22
that information at the time I'm talking

291.6 --> 296.18
a long time ago

293.22 --> 296.18
but man

296.639 --> 303.18
I've been sort of apologist towards the

300.72 --> 306.0
bacterial Theory

303.18 --> 308.639
but I didn't know that

306.0 --> 309.66
like what applies to viruses in its own

308.639 --> 313.16
right

309.66 --> 316.02000000000004
that that technically that full

313.16 --> 318.41900000000004
misunderstanding and

316.02 --> 321.02
actually really does also apply to

318.419 --> 321.02
bacteria

322.02 --> 326.09999999999997
it's

323.639 --> 329.06
like I'm probably gonna have to watch

326.1 --> 329.06
that video again

331.08 --> 335.34
take my time

332.82 --> 338.15999999999997
and really

335.34 --> 341.039
like let it sink in

338.16 --> 344.759
put it on pause every now and then and

341.039 --> 346.139
really reflect upon things that I've

344.759 --> 350.36
talked about

346.139 --> 350.36
yeah impressive stuff

352.259 --> 356.72
I don't know who this guy is by the way

359.46 --> 364.039
but the presentation was very impressive

369.66 --> 373.94
he also weirdly enough at the end part

372.12 --> 376.08
there was like warnings about

373.94 --> 377.759
hydroxychloroquine how it's actually a

376.08 --> 381.31899999999996
misapplication

377.759 --> 381.319
I had no idea

381.66 --> 386.24
I'm not sure about that part I yeah

393.12 --> 400.02
but most of it

395.699 --> 403.44
was just really really detailed

400.02 --> 406.46
like this guy did his medical research

403.44 --> 406.46
homework for sure

408.78 --> 411.919
hello good servant

430.259 --> 433.699
hey sleeping Warrior

435.3 --> 440.819
okay

437.4 --> 443.21999999999997
yeah by the way Nathan announced that

440.819 --> 446.88
there wouldn't be any Flat Earth debate

443.22 --> 446.88000000000005
live today unfortunately

450.96 --> 457.13899999999995
very disappointing so who knows I might

453.9 --> 460.25899999999996
be going a little longer

457.139 --> 463.199
a little though not gonna do another two

460.259 --> 465.96000000000004
hours on top of the normal show

463.199 --> 468.44
why not he didn't say

465.96 --> 468.44
Tony

469.319 --> 473.38
didn't say

470.21 --> 473.38
[Music]

488.639 --> 495.259
people in college studying astrobiology

491.52 --> 495.25899999999996
yeah that's pretty ridiculous

496.68 --> 501.86
it's like what astrobiology is

501.9 --> 509.87899999999996
it's like biological theoretics

506.4 --> 512.9599999999999
like what why is it

509.879 --> 512.96
it's ridiculous

513.959 --> 519.26
it's like why unless it's actually to

516.839 --> 519.2600000000001
provide

520.5 --> 524.76
ideas

522.18 --> 526.9799999999999
for genetic engineering [ __ ] right

524.76 --> 529.74
that's the only thing I can think of for

526.98 --> 532.14
some kind of productive feedback but

529.74 --> 533.76
that's it the rest is complete waste of

532.14 --> 537.12
time

533.76 --> 539.64
anyway hello getting wisdom and here we

537.12 --> 540.6
go again good to see you all on this

539.64 --> 543.18
Friday

540.6 --> 546.0600000000001
the 25th of June

543.18 --> 549.14
2021

546.06 --> 549.14
hello clutch bear

561.38 --> 569.279
right what is an astrobiologist

565.14 --> 570.72
well I'm just taking it for the nature

569.279 --> 574.38
of the words

570.72 --> 576.6600000000001
so Astro obviously

574.38 --> 578.76
whenever that's used in some kind of

576.66 --> 582.4399999999999
description it's always about things

578.76 --> 582.4399999999999
happening outside of the Earth

582.959 --> 587.8199999999999
so

584.22 --> 593.0600000000001
an astrobiologist to me seems obviously

587.82 --> 593.0600000000001
about biology outside of the Earth

596.7 --> 603.6
and since there is no provable or ritual

600.12 --> 605.519
reachable biology outside of the earth

603.6 --> 608.279
it's

605.519 --> 612.079
ridiculous

608.279 --> 612.079
right space biologists

638.37 --> 641.499
[Music]

645.019 --> 652.76
considers if extraterrestrial life

648.12 --> 652.76
exists yes so it's purely theoretical

653.399 --> 657.62
there's nothing practical about it

657.86 --> 665.0
except

659.519 --> 665.0
if it could be true which it can't

666.6 --> 669.14
right

676.86 --> 682.32
because the region for the field doesn't

680.279 --> 684.5
exist

682.32 --> 684.5
foreign

693.32 --> 697.62
my children to the forest floor letting

695.94 --> 699.9200000000001
them do their thing but watching is

697.62 --> 703.7
still good in my book yeah yeah it is

699.92 --> 703.6999999999999
absolutely gaining wisdom

731.579 --> 734.579
foreign

741.12 --> 746.48
hey Tony by the way did you did you

743.7 --> 746.48
watch tenet

747.54 --> 750.98
said you were gonna watch it

771.42 --> 776.959
there is a great challenge what okay

774.3 --> 776.959
good turn

778.44 --> 781.339
foreign

802.98 --> 808.26
all right

805.079 --> 810.92
not the correct file format on the TV

808.26 --> 810.92
what

815.22 --> 821.519
don't you just can't you just hook up

818.579 --> 824.959
your PC to the TV and use it as a

821.519 --> 824.9590000000001
monitor isn't that much easier

833.04 --> 838.74
or you gotta update

835.62 --> 841.76
like the uh the file formats

838.74 --> 843.66
for the software of the

841.76 --> 846.0
TV

843.66 --> 849.24
video streamer

846.0 --> 853.019
right you gotta update that [ __ ]

849.24 --> 855.48
because new file formats constantly or

853.019 --> 858.5
while not not that quickly but they do

855.48 --> 858.5
happen over time

860.76 --> 863.18
anyway

880.5 --> 887.3
right so let's go hello

884.22 --> 887.3000000000001
George Sanford

907.139 --> 914.0
got green tea here but it's still

910.8 --> 914.0
way too hot

927.899 --> 931.279
hey Julio pevin

949.94 --> 954.3000000000001
right so again guys no flat Earth

952.56 --> 957.0
debates live today

954.3 --> 958.92
pray he will probably just play Premiere

957.0 --> 961.639
but

958.92 --> 961.639
uh

973.44 --> 976.6990000000001
so what's up

1021.019 --> 1025.15
okay

1022.05 --> 1025.1499999999999
[Music]

1034.76 --> 1039.799
oh

1036.62 --> 1042.4589999999998
it's an audio book good servant

1039.799 --> 1042.459
huh

1043.22 --> 1046.299
it's paintings

1050.66 --> 1053.26
hmm

1057.799 --> 1060.52
all right

1064.22 --> 1069.82
all right I'd have to actually watch it

1066.44 --> 1069.8200000000002
with audio to judge

1071.179 --> 1075.52
the drawings in innocent enough

1076.039 --> 1079.94
very typical uh

1080.72 --> 1084.46
Hey Kevin Horizons

1119.66 --> 1123.7
what sleeping what are you talking about

1127.7 --> 1131.96
you mean like

1129.559 --> 1134.3799999999999
are you talking about Corona situation

1131.96 --> 1134.38
and

1135.58 --> 1143.24
vaccine deaths and how there's people

1139.22 --> 1144.2
waiting in line to buy up [ __ ] from that

1143.24 --> 1147.28
people

1144.2 --> 1147.28
basically yeah

1152.96 --> 1161.8400000000001
football oh [ __ ] yeah oh wow Tony that

1157.58 --> 1164.5
that was of course football it's like

1161.84 --> 1164.5
what

1172.58 --> 1176.98
LFC I don't know what LFC is

1179.6 --> 1184.4189999999999
it's a religion in Liverpool yeah so

1181.88 --> 1184.419
I've heard

1185.9 --> 1190.7
dude there's some brilliant episodes on

1189.38 --> 1195.4
uh

1190.7 --> 1195.4
the I.T crowd about that like

1195.7 --> 1199.179
timelessly funny

1200.66 --> 1206.3600000000001
like how they

1202.82 --> 1208.46
like these guys are not into football at

1206.36 --> 1212.78
all they're like nerds but they try to

1208.46 --> 1214.7
like act like it and then they get

1212.78 --> 1217.7
caught up in a group and it gets

1214.7 --> 1220.9
completely out of control as usual it's

1217.7 --> 1220.9
super hilarious

1222.679 --> 1225.3400000000001
ah

1227.96 --> 1233.419
and I think that's in Liverpool too or

1230.72 --> 1235.46
something it's somewhere very close

1233.419 --> 1237.8600000000001
like in Central

1235.46 --> 1240.64
Britain

1237.86 --> 1240.6399999999999
somewhere

1253.34 --> 1258.4599999999998
no choreos when you toss a football uh

1270.62 --> 1277.039
it depends though if you are spinning

1273.559 --> 1280.58
now let's say one player grabs another

1277.039 --> 1282.799
player by defeat and start spinning him

1280.58 --> 1284.6589999999999
around and the because he wants the

1282.799 --> 1287.36
player to

1284.659 --> 1291.7990000000002
drop the ball

1287.36 --> 1295.6399999999999
so the other player then throws the ball

1291.799 --> 1297.98
tries to throw it to his colleague

1295.64 --> 1300.74
and then the ball just suddenly makes a

1297.98 --> 1302.96
coriolis deviation because he is

1300.74 --> 1304.88
spitting right if the blood rushing to

1302.96 --> 1308.059
his head from the centrifugal force

1304.88 --> 1311.72
hasn't knocked him out yet

1308.059 --> 1314.6
and he's he lets go the ball

1311.72 --> 1317.1200000000001
and or he throws it and then it starts

1314.6 --> 1320.12
to deviate that's Coriolis effect so

1317.12 --> 1322.1
Coriolis effect can happen when you

1320.12 --> 1326.9799999999998
throw a football in the field

1322.1 --> 1326.98
it depends on if you are spitting

1333.86 --> 1338.4799999999998
right

1335.059 --> 1341.48
but after you've thrown the ball

1338.48 --> 1343.28
it is not gonna spin because the Earth

1341.48 --> 1346.64
is turning underneath

1343.28 --> 1348.94
that sort of choreo's deviation doesn't

1346.64 --> 1348.94
happen

1358.52 --> 1361.179
ah

1384.2 --> 1388.039
hmm

1385.64 --> 1390.74
interesting Kevin Horizons

1388.039 --> 1394.46
well maybe you can figure out the exact

1390.74 --> 1396.4
pattern of the optical slant effect

1394.46 --> 1398.2
because I've

1396.4 --> 1401.48
explained

1398.2 --> 1404.659
non-numerically I've explained how the

1401.48 --> 1408.039
optical slam effect I can

1404.659 --> 1408.0390000000002
I'll just do it by hand

1408.32 --> 1413.02
the eyesight goes to a certain point

1410.78 --> 1416.0
after which things start to obstruct

1413.02 --> 1418.94
conceal bottom up

1416.0 --> 1420.98
and then get things also get smaller

1418.94 --> 1423.919
into the distance and they yeah

1420.98 --> 1426.679
eventually might

1423.919 --> 1430.22
drop out of sight

1426.679 --> 1432.2
behind that concealment zone right so

1430.22 --> 1434.779
there is a direct correlation between

1432.2 --> 1437.9
observation height

1434.779 --> 1440.179
where you're at looking over the plane

1437.9 --> 1444.14
and where the optical slant will start

1440.179 --> 1446.419
so if you go up higher

1444.14 --> 1448.8400000000001
then suddenly the optical slant will

1446.419 --> 1448.8400000000001
move away

1450.26 --> 1455.559
right

1452.26 --> 1459.679
now would be interesting to get an exact

1455.559 --> 1462.82
mathematic mathematically exact

1459.679 --> 1462.8200000000002
system for this

1463.58 --> 1467.6589999999999
so you could

1465.02 --> 1469.46
pull it up in numbers the exact pattern

1467.659 --> 1472.279
of it right

1469.46 --> 1474.2
but I yeah I'm just saying this is

1472.279 --> 1477.34
possible not saying that I'm

1474.2 --> 1477.3400000000001
particularly interested

1481.34 --> 1487.76
but yeah if you're gonna try such tests

1485.0 --> 1490.159
to try to prove that there is a

1487.76 --> 1493.96
curvature of Earth yeah then you gotta

1490.159 --> 1493.96
got a bit of an issue there

1494.059 --> 1497.3799999999999
because that's not gonna work

1502.76 --> 1506.72
The Horizon is not

1505.279 --> 1508.58
the edge

1506.72 --> 1510.8600000000001
of a geometry

1508.58 --> 1512.6589999999999
you understand

1510.86 --> 1516.1
it's not

1512.659 --> 1516.1000000000001
it's purely Optical

1529.88 --> 1533.679
what ifs okay

1535.36 --> 1540.559
to who's next oh hey Jim oh you're ready

1538.7 --> 1542.6000000000001
for the execution line

1540.559 --> 1545.84
oh yes oh

1542.6 --> 1547.82
oh Slaughter finally some Bloodshed in

1545.84 --> 1549.799
the arena of the New World Order oh

1547.82 --> 1553.82
you're so eager

1549.799 --> 1556.82
oh more death oh let ariman come through

1553.82 --> 1559.3999999999999
me right AGM are you here what you say

1556.82 --> 1561.32
no okay I'm exaggerating

1559.4 --> 1565.76
but I'm seeing this sort of [ __ ] all

1561.32 --> 1568.82
around it's like oh yes the Bloodshed oh

1565.76 --> 1571.48
who is next oh

1568.82 --> 1571.48
really

1574.19 --> 1577.269
[Music]

1579.45 --> 1583.279
[Music]

1580.82 --> 1586.12
I haven't seen any real proof that the

1583.279 --> 1586.12
guy is even dead

1591.679 --> 1596.1200000000001
I mean there's more proof that Epstein

1594.74 --> 1597.38
was actually dead

1596.12 --> 1600.1399999999999
right

1597.38 --> 1601.94
because she saw a photo

1600.14 --> 1604.8200000000002
after his death

1601.94 --> 1608.0
that I haven't seen anything

1604.82 --> 1610.46
so as far as I'm concerned

1608.0 --> 1614.14
what Owen Benjamin said about it on this

1610.46 --> 1614.14
show is completely On Target

1614.48 --> 1619.88
might change though my turnout that he

1617.36 --> 1621.32
actually died but so far I have no see

1619.88 --> 1624.3200000000002
no Direct

1621.32 --> 1626.96
empirical evidence that that might be

1624.32 --> 1629.62
the case that he's actually dead

1626.96 --> 1629.6200000000001
so

1630.62 --> 1635.539
until further

1632.72 --> 1638.799
evidence appears

1635.539 --> 1638.799
that's my sense

1643.039 --> 1650.799
okay each new Epstein oh God

1647.36 --> 1650.799
is that supposed to mean

1666.799 --> 1672.94
ajm

1669.14 --> 1672.94
the [ __ ] is wrong with you

1676.58 --> 1681.34
and why can't I remove that freaking

1678.98 --> 1681.34
message

1684.399 --> 1689.32
what the hell is wrong with this [ __ ]

1687.08 --> 1689.32
YouTube

1712.399 --> 1715.0
what

1717.02 --> 1719.26
foreign

1723.64 --> 1728.14
what the hell is wrong with you

1729.86 --> 1733.24
this is insane

1736.94 --> 1743.539
I'm trying to remove agm's message there

1739.76 --> 1745.24
in chat and I can't I literally cannot

1743.539 --> 1749.779
remove it

1745.24 --> 1753.32
why the [ __ ] YouTube I can lit every

1749.779 --> 1756.2
other three dots I hover over click on I

1753.32 --> 1758.48
have a trash can remove option now this

1756.2 --> 1761.3600000000001
one [ __ ] sentence

1758.48 --> 1764.32
I don't have the remove option what the

1761.36 --> 1764.32
hell is going on

1767.059 --> 1773.299
I don't care here we go and I don't care

1770.179 --> 1775.039
it doesn't matter if it's a joke if he's

1773.299 --> 1778.22
referring to something if there's a

1775.039 --> 1783.5
deeper meaning to it I literally can't

1778.22 --> 1785.779
remove it there is no option for me as a

1783.5 --> 1788.179
as the freaking show host

1785.779 --> 1791.24
looking on that chat being the channel

1788.179 --> 1794.72
owner to be able to remove that freaking

1791.24 --> 1797.36
message it makes no damn [ __ ] sense

1794.72 --> 1801.2
even though the other messages every

1797.36 --> 1803.36
other message that I clicked on I can so

1801.2 --> 1806.98
you explain that to me

1803.36 --> 1806.9799999999998
what the [ __ ]

1811.399 --> 1815.32
it's not freaking funny ATM

1818.72 --> 1824.6000000000001
I'm not saying you did this I'm saying

1821.779 --> 1826.46
what the [ __ ] is up with this mechanical

1824.6 --> 1830.12
result

1826.46 --> 1832.82
it's like I wish I had well you know

1830.12 --> 1835.6999999999998
what screw that I'm literally going to

1832.82 --> 1839.84
show you exactly what I'm doing here

1835.7 --> 1843.02
okay so look at this see this

1839.84 --> 1844.9399999999998
oh Christ uh

1843.02 --> 1846.3799999999999
right

1844.94 --> 1847.64
see

1846.38 --> 1850.1000000000001
click

1847.64 --> 1852.98
see that pop-up menu

1850.1 --> 1854.36
see the third option trash can remove

1852.98 --> 1857.24
right

1854.36 --> 1859.279
okay now I'm gonna go to another AGM

1857.24 --> 1863.779
message right pop up

1859.279 --> 1866.019
trash can remove right so now look at

1863.779 --> 1866.019
this

1866.24 --> 1877.72
and [ __ ] [ __ ] right his message

1871.48 --> 1877.72
where the [ __ ] is the remove

1878.919 --> 1883.659
what the [ __ ] is this

1884.299 --> 1889.7
here another tone yeah see remove let's

1888.08 --> 1893.6589999999999
remove yeah

1889.7 --> 1897.2
tiny one more here up remove

1893.659 --> 1900.22
sleeping Warrior remove

1897.2 --> 1900.22
no remove

1901.1 --> 1909.6399999999999
what the [ __ ]

1904.179 --> 1909.64
I I don't know what's going on man

1917.299 --> 1919.84
right

1924.5 --> 1929.659
that [ __ ] freaks me out because it makes

1927.559 --> 1932.24
no sense

1929.659 --> 1935.6000000000001
like even if it was some kind of a weird

1932.24 --> 1937.58
fluke it makes no sense

1935.6 --> 1940.6999999999998
how did that happen

1937.58 --> 1944.059
what got tagged in order to cause this

1940.7 --> 1946.64
and why why does that even exist

1944.059 --> 1949.6
there's some weird flukish political

1946.64 --> 1954.1000000000001
designation or something that got

1949.6 --> 1954.1
randomed in or like what was that

1956.539 --> 1959.74
shut up idiom

1961.82 --> 1964.36
ah

1979.039 --> 1983.32
what does that have to do with it George

1980.84 --> 1983.32
Sanford

1996.74 --> 2002.14
message you need to be putting out there

1998.6 --> 2004.36
well maybe maybe yeah that still doesn't

2002.14 --> 2006.3990000000001
make any sense why certainly the remove

2004.36 --> 2009.519
option wasn't there

2006.399 --> 2012.82
right here's the thing about it the

2009.519 --> 2015.3990000000001
message has already been on screen

2012.82 --> 2019.08
so technically I can't remove something

2015.399 --> 2021.58
I can only correct something afterwards

2019.08 --> 2023.62
demonstratively like I don't like it

2021.58 --> 2027.519
when you say things like that

2023.62 --> 2032.039
right it's still going to be visible

2027.519 --> 2032.039
on the chat screen on video

2032.919 --> 2037.48
so

2034.299 --> 2039.179
it how

2037.48 --> 2043.72
foreign

2039.179 --> 2046.539
what's going on how is that possible

2043.72 --> 2049.54
right it's not just like oh no I can't

2046.539 --> 2052.06
remove any of hm's things no I clicked

2049.54 --> 2054.339
on other messages from him and there is

2052.06 --> 2056.2599999999998
a remove option no it's that one

2054.339 --> 2058.619
freaking message

2056.26 --> 2062.76
it was rearranged completely different

2058.619 --> 2062.76
it makes no sense

2063.04 --> 2067.899
why

2064.659 --> 2070.54
I've never seen that before

2067.899 --> 2072.399
never like that like does the chat's

2070.54 --> 2075.04
been like screwed up and that certainly

2072.399 --> 2077.56
no functions or whatever

2075.04 --> 2081.839
but it would apply equally never like

2077.56 --> 2081.839
this is the weirdest thing ever

2089.02 --> 2094.2599999999998
anyway let's get to something more

2091.839 --> 2094.2599999999998
interesting

2097.72 --> 2104.2
then weird internet flukes

2101.56 --> 2106.98
it must be a fluke makes no sense

2104.2 --> 2106.98
otherwise

2108.28 --> 2114.46
but with most flukes I do usually have

2111.28 --> 2116.7400000000002
like a good idea as to how that happens

2114.46 --> 2119.2
and then the consistencies

2116.74 --> 2121.2999999999997
right turning it off and on again or

2119.2 --> 2125.2
reloading your browser

2121.3 --> 2127.78
etc etc sometimes yeah usually fixes

2125.2 --> 2131.98
those types of looks in this case I've

2127.78 --> 2134.8590000000004
already refreshed the chat several times

2131.98 --> 2138.099
and it's still there specifically with

2134.859 --> 2141.119
that message now that's weird

2138.099 --> 2141.119
really weird

2144.64 --> 2147.2999999999997
anyway

2163.18 --> 2168.66
do I no I don't have any plans for

2165.28 --> 2168.6600000000003
episode 1000

2170.68 --> 2175.24
that I actually understand the comment

2172.839 --> 2178.06
not at first AGM

2175.24 --> 2180.5789999999997
yes I was going to presumptuously delete

2178.06 --> 2183.22
your message and then probably end up

2180.579 --> 2184.2400000000002
apologizing about it afterward but the

2183.22 --> 2186.3999999999996
thing is

2184.24 --> 2189.3999999999996
I reserve the freaking right to make

2186.4 --> 2193.619
such mistakes and to potentially make an

2189.4 --> 2193.619
ass of myself because it's my show

2194.74 --> 2197.2799999999997
right

2198.52 --> 2203.94
but yeah I did look at it afterward

2209.8 --> 2215.26
it's still a trashy comment though it's

2212.68 --> 2217.7799999999997
like who gives a [ __ ] about the sexual

2215.26 --> 2219.7000000000003
behavior of some Minister it's like it's

2217.78 --> 2222.2400000000002
it is still trashy

2219.7 --> 2222.24
right

2226.72 --> 2232.54
anyway oh by the way thanks good servant

2229.0 --> 2234.22
for the what the hell the 99 cent third

2232.54 --> 2236.82
like

2234.22 --> 2236.8199999999997
what

2239.98 --> 2243.359
hey Tony Whitcomb

2267.16 --> 2272.5
oh no here we go again was he breaking

2270.04 --> 2274.74
social distance guidelines

2272.5 --> 2277.18
oh

2274.74 --> 2280.8999999999996
mean minister

2277.18 --> 2283.54
for not doing that obviously ridiculous

2280.9 --> 2286.98
false law

2283.54 --> 2286.98
that nobody should be doing

2291.88 --> 2295.54
I mean

2293.2 --> 2300.54
if your overall point is He's a

2295.54 --> 2300.54
hypocrite then uh yeah

2300.88 --> 2309.2200000000003
aren't they all isn't that blatant

2305.2 --> 2313.74
yes a politician being hypocritical

2309.22 --> 2313.74
is not exactly a new phenomena

2315.099 --> 2319.96
I think most people even those that have

2318.22 --> 2323.9199999999996
very little understanding of what's

2319.96 --> 2326.88
going on still get that at this point

2323.92 --> 2326.88
so yes

2327.88 --> 2330.359
uh

2351.52 --> 2356.02
dude Kevin Horizons things could get so

2354.64 --> 2358.1189999999997
crazy man

2356.02 --> 2361.56
[ __ ]

2358.119 --> 2364.42
if these these covet

2361.56 --> 2367.2999999999997
nonsense narrative doctors

2364.42 --> 2369.599
would want to they could actually claim

2367.3 --> 2369.599
that

2369.64 --> 2376.0
losing football matches

2372.28 --> 2377.619
for your team could literally cause the

2376.0 --> 2380.44
spreading of covet

2377.619 --> 2381.94
sit because people could get it right

2380.44 --> 2384.82
especially if they're going to be all

2381.94 --> 2388.68
vaccines which is not a vaccine or

2384.82 --> 2388.6800000000003
poison from that garbage

2388.9 --> 2393.76
and then yeah their two team loses and

2391.48 --> 2395.92
they all get ah damn it and then

2393.76 --> 2398.079
everybody's like oh damn it right yeah

2395.92 --> 2402.76
that actually has

2398.079 --> 2405.0600000000004
toxic influence on already poisoned body

2402.76 --> 2409.3190000000004
yeah you could then get sick from

2405.06 --> 2412.599
demoralization that's just so ridiculous

2409.319 --> 2415.44
oh I don't know if they're gonna do that

2412.599 --> 2415.44
but they could

2416.319 --> 2422.8
because that's the level of silly [ __ ]

2419.8 --> 2426.04
in how they roll out narratives and

2422.8 --> 2431.2200000000003
claims they do it like that they just

2426.04 --> 2431.22
know how things really work through

2431.26 --> 2437.5
for demoralization

2435.04 --> 2439.3
psychosomatics

2437.5 --> 2441.4
and poison

2439.3 --> 2444.6400000000003
percentage in your body pretty much

2441.4 --> 2446.56
through various sources and influences

2444.64 --> 2448.48
and they just know that in their

2446.56 --> 2450.46
modeling I don't know if the people that

2448.48 --> 2452.56
are handing out the actual

2450.46 --> 2456.16
conversations

2452.56 --> 2458.619
are writing it up know it but the

2456.16 --> 2464.2799999999997
systems or the people

2458.619 --> 2468.119
that help them size up the situation do

2464.28 --> 2471.88
whether that's like some kind of a super

2468.119 --> 2473.56
machine intelligence that has oversight

2471.88 --> 2475.599
overall information

2473.56 --> 2478.359
or whether that's a couple of really

2475.599 --> 2481.06
smart people that are wisely keeping

2478.359 --> 2483.339
themselves outside of the actor

2481.06 --> 2484.839
acting part

2483.339 --> 2488.2599999999998
could be either

2484.839 --> 2490.42
but they must understand

2488.26 --> 2492.6400000000003
that it's all fake and they are building

2490.42 --> 2496.359
on the knowledge of how it really works

2492.64 --> 2500.46
to further the false narrative it must

2496.359 --> 2500.46
be so there's no other way

2501.94 --> 2506.14
and if they have no such guidance then

2504.22 --> 2509.2
they're just literally gonna stumble

2506.14 --> 2513.819
around until they luckily get onto a

2509.2 --> 2515.98
halfway productive idea for where

2513.819 --> 2519.7599999999998
it's what they want to achieve right

2515.98 --> 2523.18
they might stumble onto this by accident

2519.76 --> 2525.6400000000003
in just spitball brainstorming somehow

2523.18 --> 2528.0989999999997
or picking it off other people as

2525.64 --> 2531.2799999999997
inspiration

2528.099 --> 2536.2000000000003
but unless there is like a true guidance

2531.28 --> 2538.3590000000004
to really help them yeah perpetuate the

2536.2 --> 2540.5789999999997
narrative in a halfway believable

2538.359 --> 2545.44
fashion for people that are ill-informed

2540.579 --> 2548.079
they must know it's fake there's no

2545.44 --> 2550.68
other option with this

2548.079 --> 2550.6800000000003
anyway

2556.06 --> 2561.52
I could get away with no no that was a

2559.54 --> 2564.4
joke

2561.52 --> 2566.92
that was a joke because there were some

2564.4 --> 2570.339
trolls that were so desperate

2566.92 --> 2573.099
to to become part of me right to they

2570.339 --> 2576.2799999999997
they tried to plant themselves at my

2573.099 --> 2578.8
side to be a constant pushing influence

2576.28 --> 2580.42
that's what they tried Pegasus Thorn and

2578.8 --> 2582.04
started whining about wrenches and then

2580.42 --> 2584.14
I said okay well yeah

2582.04 --> 2587.74
pay me 50 dollars

2584.14 --> 2590.44
give me fifty dollar for wrench

2587.74 --> 2591.339
you won't be moderator fifty dollar for

2590.44 --> 2594.96
range

2591.339 --> 2594.96
right it was a joke

2597.64 --> 2602.52
it's ridiculous

2599.92 --> 2602.52
anyway

2604.78 --> 2610.7200000000003
right now I just hand them out to people

2607.9 --> 2613.06
that deserve it

2610.72 --> 2617.0989999999997
and that wants the responsibility

2613.06 --> 2617.099
because not everybody wants a wrench

2621.819 --> 2625.8
of this pandemic this time

2627.76 --> 2635.8190000000004
right well Tony Whitcomb the the real

2631.48 --> 2638.92
pandemic is demoralization and

2635.819 --> 2642.099
compounded toxic influences

2638.92 --> 2644.44
that's the real pandemic

2642.099 --> 2646.92
specific combination of those two

2644.44 --> 2646.92
factors

2648.16 --> 2656.68
oh hey proactive procrastinator okay

2652.9 --> 2660.6600000000003
I already addressed the debate the other

2656.68 --> 2660.66
day it was the most

2661.42 --> 2668.079
grinding

2664.2 --> 2671.02
intellectually embarrassing

2668.079 --> 2673.0600000000004
shameful

2671.02 --> 2676.0
I've ever seen

2673.06 --> 2679.0
the supposedly involving Flat Earth and

2676.0 --> 2682.18
the ball earth like for it's a pure

2679.0 --> 2684.099
embarrassment for both sides it's just a

2682.18 --> 2685.7999999999997
pure embarrassment everything about it

2684.099 --> 2689.8
was stupid

2685.8 --> 2692.2000000000003
literally headache inducing it's like

2689.8 --> 2694.8390000000004
spiritually toxic everything about it

2692.2 --> 2697.72
was stupid and pointless and

2694.839 --> 2699.96
embarrassing and idiotic everything

2697.72 --> 2703.5
about it

2699.96 --> 2703.5
both sides

2705.52 --> 2710.079
all right

2706.8 --> 2712.48
[Music]

2710.079 --> 2715.6600000000003
and that's really embarrassing for

2712.48 --> 2718.599
somebody for a supposed flatter to sink

2715.66 --> 2722.0789999999997
as low as to be equal to freaking fight

2718.599 --> 2724.2400000000002
the Flat Earth now that's an achievement

2722.079 --> 2728.28
right that's

2724.24 --> 2728.2799999999997
a really bad achievement

2730.42 --> 2733.079
anyway

2748.54 --> 2755.02
he wants to go again oh my God that dude

2752.68 --> 2758.2
Santos

2755.02 --> 2760.3
I think he's switched I think he's

2758.2 --> 2762.819
literally I don't know what the [ __ ]

2760.3 --> 2765.04
he's been up to but he's in the Reversed

2762.819 --> 2767.02
world

2765.04 --> 2769.42
and I'm not talking about the tenet

2767.02 --> 2771.579
reversed world just

2769.42 --> 2773.079
a fascinating science fiction to me

2771.579 --> 2776.1600000000003
still

2773.079 --> 2776.1600000000003
and I'm talking about

2776.2 --> 2781.359
the spiritual reversed world

2778.599 --> 2784.3
if he wants to do that again

2781.359 --> 2788.04
then he is [ __ ]

2784.3 --> 2788.04
it's literally inside out

2789.46 --> 2792.819
hmm

2790.599 --> 2795.52
and there's already other things that he

2792.819 --> 2796.839
said that already kind of support that

2795.52 --> 2800.02
direction

2796.839 --> 2803.5
so these

2800.02 --> 2805.66
he's going down that staircase guys it's

2803.5 --> 2807.579
not good it's gonna end up really

2805.66 --> 2810.7
terrible

2807.579 --> 2811.9
it's already pretty terrible

2810.7 --> 2814.48
ugh

2811.9 --> 2817.079
apparently he wants to do it yeah

2814.48 --> 2817.079
anyway

2833.579 --> 2839.3390000000004
Santos

2835.3 --> 2839.3390000000004
good servant crying out loud

2846.04 --> 2851.2
when agent how do you call him a sneaky

2849.16 --> 2853.2999999999997
new Ager

2851.2 --> 2856.2
what is that

2853.3 --> 2856.2000000000003
what

2856.48 --> 2863.28
no there's nothing wrong with new agers

2858.94 --> 2863.28
they're usually kind of superficial

2863.319 --> 2866.64
but harmless

2867.52 --> 2871.599
it's when you get all anti-christian and

2870.04 --> 2875.68
[ __ ]

2871.599 --> 2880.1400000000003
basically disregard logos disregard the

2875.68 --> 2880.14
warnings that's that's not new Ager

2885.28 --> 2888.059
it's just

2886.72 --> 2891.4599999999996
yeah

2888.059 --> 2895.96
that's what happens when you roll into

2891.46 --> 2899.079
the darkness it's accidental satanic

2895.96 --> 2901.2400000000002
and then from accidental into on purpose

2899.079 --> 2904.559
and that's how you end up in a

2901.24 --> 2904.5589999999997
spiritually reversed world

2907.9 --> 2913.0
or you could call it luciferian

2910.839 --> 2915.359
it certainly comes in the form of a

2913.0 --> 2915.359
seduction

2916.059 --> 2922.2400000000002
anyway

2918.339 --> 2922.24
have I read Revelations

2923.02 --> 2926.02
no

2928.78 --> 2936.119
the mark of the beast

2931.68 --> 2936.1189999999997
dude I'd have to go into some

2937.9 --> 2945.339
I'd actually have to read it

2941.319 --> 2947.5
carefully because yeah dude there's so

2945.339 --> 2949.839
many issues

2947.5 --> 2951.7
so many relations with the idea of the

2949.839 --> 2955.48
mark of the the mark of the beast guys

2951.7 --> 2957.5789999999997
has been an aberration of the mind not

2955.48 --> 2961.2400000000002
saying that it is fake I'm just saying

2957.579 --> 2963.819
that it's haunting and people see it in

2961.24 --> 2968.02
everything you can get crazy over it

2963.819 --> 2973.44
over the idea of it so

2968.02 --> 2975.339
to truly understand the esoterics of it

2973.44 --> 2977.079
Beyond

2975.339 --> 2978.339
well what's already kind of been known

2977.079 --> 2980.92
it's about

2978.339 --> 2983.7999999999997
letting yourself be marked by evil

2980.92 --> 2986.14
rights it's more to me I take it very

2983.8 --> 2989.92
esoteric very spiritual

2986.14 --> 2991.1189999999997
it's the decision to be part of evil

2989.92 --> 2993.819
for

2991.119 --> 2997.1800000000003
some Earthly goal

2993.819 --> 3000.119
but as you do it you lose the Excellence

2997.18 --> 3003.0589999999997
of the pure Spirit you lose purity

3000.119 --> 3005.819
right and that Mark is permanent

3003.059 --> 3009.96
because now you're tied into the working

3005.819 --> 3013.8
for the Earthly goal in the process of

3009.96 --> 3016.5
lead yeah vacating certain parts of the

3013.8 --> 3018.78
spirit in favor of that and what yeah

3016.5 --> 3021.119
once you get onto that and you keep

3018.78 --> 3024.78
proceeding then it becomes

3021.119 --> 3026.88
more of a loss to stop it

3024.78 --> 3030.6800000000003
because you can't get the things that

3026.88 --> 3030.6800000000003
are lost back anyway right

3033.0 --> 3037.5
but that's a real mark of the beast like

3035.16 --> 3040.02
the Beast is to me like the Earthly and

3037.5 --> 3041.76
what are you going to sacrifice to it to

3040.02 --> 3044.46
achieve something

3041.76 --> 3047.7000000000003
do you really understand what the real

3044.46 --> 3048.7200000000003
sacrifice is do you realize what you

3047.7 --> 3052.6189999999997
have

3048.72 --> 3056.8999999999996
or are you only going to realize it when

3052.619 --> 3056.9
you lose it after you've been lured into

3059.52 --> 3064.04
pursuing a specific Earthly goal

3092.4 --> 3100.88
yeah I know Tony Whitcomb

3094.859 --> 3100.88
about the yeah that crazy at-home [ __ ]

3107.16 --> 3114.02
it was like

3109.74 --> 3114.02
Jerry Springer level trashy

3114.66 --> 3119.16
like pinnacle

3116.7 --> 3124.0789999999997
Jerry Springer level trashy like a

3119.16 --> 3125.46
really really trashy this is

3124.079 --> 3128.059
uh

3125.46 --> 3128.059
anyway

3140.18 --> 3146.339
esoteric basically means knowledge

3143.52 --> 3148.94
hidden to those in the know

3146.339 --> 3148.94
what

3156.24 --> 3163.859
or esoteric to me means

3160.4 --> 3166.92
it's all about the consciousness

3163.859 --> 3169.38
and the more you know

3166.92 --> 3170.88
the more you start to see and what you

3169.38 --> 3173.46
had already learned

3170.88 --> 3176.04
so a basic sentence that's just a basic

3173.46 --> 3177.839
very basic good advice to like a kid or

3176.04 --> 3181.68
whatever

3177.839 --> 3184.2
can later reflect onto more broader

3181.68 --> 3186.0
situations that as a kid didn't fully

3184.2 --> 3188.0989999999997
understand and later

3186.0 --> 3189.66
starts to see like wait that applies to

3188.099 --> 3190.98
even more

3189.66 --> 3193.319
so

3190.98 --> 3197.579
they start to get

3193.319 --> 3200.819
the esoteric implication

3197.579 --> 3204.6800000000003
of it of the thing that was originally

3200.819 --> 3208.4
simple that's real esoterrorism is like

3204.68 --> 3208.3999999999996
existential consequences

3210.66 --> 3216.0589999999997
like how will they last

3213.66 --> 3219.359
the tested time

3216.059 --> 3221.9
throughout a Consciousness Ascension

3219.359 --> 3221.9
process

3223.5 --> 3229.319
so I'm constantly trying to size up

3227.52 --> 3232.319
that

3229.319 --> 3236.46
which I know I will eventually

3232.319 --> 3239.94
understand but do not fully yet

3236.46 --> 3243.859
and then I feel out towards how it will

3239.94 --> 3243.859
be when I will understand it

3243.96 --> 3247.099
that's what I do

3248.16 --> 3256.5789999999997
it's how I learn it's

3252.059 --> 3256.579
it's quite surreal in a way but it works

3259.68 --> 3261.859
foreign

3267.26 --> 3272.7000000000003
a lot better at it because I used to try

3270.48 --> 3276.359
this even as a kid

3272.7 --> 3279.0
but since I was very

3276.359 --> 3284.04
gullible

3279.0 --> 3288.059
and over simplified idealistic

3284.04 --> 3292.079
I couldn't accurately predict

3288.059 --> 3296.96
the esoterics of things because I could

3292.079 --> 3296.96
not see it I could not accept

3297.24 --> 3305.8799999999997
the burdened balance of reality

3300.839 --> 3309.839
at that time so I was bad at it now

3305.88 --> 3312.059
I can except the reality the real

3309.839 --> 3314.52
reality

3312.059 --> 3315.3190000000004
and the burdens and the tests and how

3314.52 --> 3318.48
it's

3315.319 --> 3320.94
beyond us really

3318.48 --> 3324.599
and that the further I Ascend in

3320.94 --> 3327.68
Consciousness the the more glaring the

3324.599 --> 3327.6800000000003
burdens will become

3328.5 --> 3331.4
virtually

3331.619 --> 3336.839
because of the wider implications of

3333.839 --> 3338.94
things and also this is because it

3336.839 --> 3341.64
correlated this is just a mechanical

3338.94 --> 3344.28
substance of things

3341.64 --> 3346.859
and how things develop also the further

3344.28 --> 3350.099
up you go on the ladder the more you

3346.859 --> 3355.2
realize is that the latter is designed

3350.099 --> 3358.2000000000003
by God and that you come across new

3355.2 --> 3360.7799999999997
depths of his creation

3358.2 --> 3363.4199999999996
it's like everywhere you go the more you

3360.78 --> 3368.88
go into the fractal the more you find

3363.42 --> 3371.94
God there having designed the place

3368.88 --> 3374.7000000000003
for you to discover

3371.94 --> 3376.559
that's also a big part of it so the

3374.7 --> 3380.819
further you rise in Consciousness the

3376.559 --> 3383.579
further you absolutely have to face

3380.819 --> 3385.04
you are not

3383.579 --> 3387.7200000000003
going to

3385.04 --> 3390.839
ascend above

3387.72 --> 3393.4199999999996
the god the Creator the designer of this

3390.839 --> 3396.7799999999997
because everywhere we go it's already

3393.42 --> 3400.079
been made for us by him

3396.78 --> 3402.78
every part of the consciousness

3400.079 --> 3405.079
he is the father we are in his playing

3402.78 --> 3405.079
Ground

3405.48 --> 3409.02
and anybody that thinks that they can be

3407.819 --> 3411.839
Beyond

3409.02 --> 3414.18
is simply arrogant and foolish and

3411.839 --> 3417.42
short-sighted and simply hasn't gazed

3414.18 --> 3420.68
upon enough of God's creation

3417.42 --> 3420.6800000000003
in the depths

3423.9 --> 3426.5
so

3435.059 --> 3437.5400000000004
right

3445.799 --> 3453.839
right but Jesus is an example for man

3450.059 --> 3454.98
it's the best designation we can find in

3453.839 --> 3456.359
our ways

3454.98 --> 3460.619
right

3456.359 --> 3462.839
but God the designer is different

3460.619 --> 3464.94
he is the designer

3462.839 --> 3467.819
Jesus is the

3464.94 --> 3471.839
is the

3467.819 --> 3474.7799999999997
the ideal player for this design

3471.839 --> 3477.119
it's the perfect example with a lot of

3474.78 --> 3479.6400000000003
existential insights

3477.119 --> 3482.4
and patterns

3479.64 --> 3485.16
throughout Ascension processes

3482.4 --> 3487.7000000000003
throughout actual enlightenments into

3485.16 --> 3487.7
the future

3500.52 --> 3507.14
right I know right Tara 306 it the

3503.64 --> 3510.66
debate never started it was just

3507.14 --> 3515.42
Apes screaming and throwing [ __ ] back

3510.66 --> 3515.42
and forth literally the entire time

3520.38 --> 3524.6600000000003
that's exactly what it felt like

3525.72 --> 3529.5789999999997
and they want to do it again

3529.619 --> 3534.54
like dude

3531.24 --> 3537.299
what is this what's wrong with you why

3534.54 --> 3539.22
would you want to do that again oh my

3537.299 --> 3542.119
God

3539.22 --> 3542.1189999999997
ah

3586.14 --> 3588.319
foreign

3592.7 --> 3600.0
[Music]

3595.579 --> 3601.92
if you haven't checked it out I take it

3600.0 --> 3604.46
that it's not really gonna mean anything

3601.92 --> 3604.46
to you

3623.7 --> 3629.2799999999997
great does it but dude

3626.94 --> 3632.88
why would you do that

3629.28 --> 3635.88
that's literally that's a rough

3632.88 --> 3640.7000000000003
comparison it's not literally okay let

3635.88 --> 3640.7000000000003
me take that back it's like a nerd

3640.98 --> 3646.26
being at school getting bullied by

3643.5 --> 3648.54
really stupid guys

3646.26 --> 3649.559
that don't like him because he's kind of

3648.54 --> 3652.5589999999997
smart

3649.559 --> 3655.92
and then when he gets bullied one day he

3652.559 --> 3657.96
literally sets up a has another person

3655.92 --> 3660.7200000000003
film it

3657.96 --> 3663.359
and then he just makes

3660.72 --> 3665.0989999999997
them bully him and even lures them out

3663.359 --> 3666.9
to get even worse and then he films it

3665.099 --> 3669.299
out and puts it on the internet

3666.9 --> 3670.619
proudly

3669.299 --> 3672.96
like

3670.619 --> 3675.42
even giving commentary afterward about

3672.96 --> 3679.52
how proud he was about doing that like

3675.42 --> 3683.64
that dude that's [ __ ] insane

3679.52 --> 3687.48
why would you do that

3683.64 --> 3690.48
he looked like a complete ass

3687.48 --> 3693.859
why would you be proud of that you've

3690.48 --> 3693.859
got to be out of your mind

3697.92 --> 3707.94
thought Santos no Santos is a is a scum

3703.38 --> 3709.28
no he doesn't know [ __ ] he's done some

3707.94 --> 3711.66
study

3709.28 --> 3714.119
memorization of stuff he had some

3711.66 --> 3717.359
interesting idea but his character is

3714.119 --> 3717.359
gone completely

3718.14 --> 3721.4
into the [ __ ]

3735.0 --> 3737.24
foreign

3750.72 --> 3755.72
I'm gonna call you a [ __ ] right now

3753.0 --> 3755.72
yeah

3755.94 --> 3764.28
they said it wasn't their freaking email

3760.52 --> 3766.319
Craig never proved it was their email he

3764.28 --> 3771.1400000000003
just said no it was

3766.319 --> 3771.14
somebody associated with you

3778.799 --> 3786.18
it was all [ __ ]

3782.22 --> 3789.0
it's just a troll sent a threat then

3786.18 --> 3791.22
Craig pinned it on them

3789.0 --> 3794.16
he might have literally made the whole

3791.22 --> 3796.7599999999998
thing up just to start yelling you

3794.16 --> 3800.1189999999997
threaded me you threatened to kill me

3796.76 --> 3804.3590000000004
it's it's the trashiest

3800.119 --> 3809.2400000000002
shittiest [ __ ] show I had ever seen

3804.359 --> 3809.24
and I've seen quite a few shitty shows

3814.1 --> 3817.2599999999998
[Music]

3818.819 --> 3825.189
yes Kevin Horizons I agree to that

3821.59 --> 3825.1890000000003
[Music]

3828.66 --> 3832.46
it's just not very consistent

3834.0 --> 3842.18
he has wild ideas and those doesn't

3837.859 --> 3842.18
recognize mistakes when he makes them

3842.4 --> 3845.1800000000003
ah

3848.28 --> 3855.6800000000003
no tiny Womble I'm calling you a [ __ ]

3851.9 --> 3859.26
because you fell for Craig's

3855.68 --> 3861.839
superficial [ __ ] act that's why I called

3859.26 --> 3864.8390000000004
you a [ __ ] because you actually bought

3861.839 --> 3865.92
the [ __ ] it didn't slip through to

3864.839 --> 3869.0389999999998
you

3865.92 --> 3871.88
that what he claimed they did they never

3869.039 --> 3871.88
even did

3874.319 --> 3882.2
so you bought Craig's [ __ ] show act that

3878.94 --> 3882.2000000000003
makes you a [ __ ]

3882.42 --> 3888.1800000000003
yeah they denied it that's right

3885.18 --> 3890.22
they said no that's not me

3888.18 --> 3893.339
that's not my email

3890.22 --> 3896.7599999999998
but apparently you forgot about that and

3893.339 --> 3900.0
then you were hypnotized by Craig's lie

3896.76 --> 3901.92
gaslighting [ __ ] show about no you did

3900.0 --> 3904.619
it anyway I'm just gonna go

3901.92 --> 3907.079
you out for doing it even though they

3904.619 --> 3912.0
never claimed to have done it

3907.079 --> 3914.819
it's it's all garbage

3912.0 --> 3918.079
I'm so glad that I just only took a

3914.819 --> 3918.079
glimpse at it God

3919.319 --> 3924.839
because this is really becoming like a

3921.9 --> 3927.78
turd staring contest like how big is

3924.839 --> 3929.94
that piece of [ __ ] like at some guys you

3927.78 --> 3932.7000000000003
just gotta flush it man

3929.94 --> 3936.2000000000003
just flush that crap forget about it

3932.7 --> 3936.2
it's it's just garbage

3950.4 --> 3956.48
yeah you didn't listen that carefully

3952.14 --> 3956.48
but apparently you got out of it

3957.68 --> 3964.46
exactly what Craig was gaslighting

3961.2 --> 3964.46
everybody to think

3964.5 --> 3970.26
wouldn't look through it

3967.619 --> 3971.88
okay calling you a [ __ ] maybe a little

3970.26 --> 3974.8190000000004
harsh

3971.88 --> 3977.339
it's prills still pretty stupid to

3974.819 --> 3979.68
actually take his superficial act on his

3977.339 --> 3982.0789999999997
word without looking deeper into it to

3979.68 --> 3985.5
actually start out assuming that he

3982.079 --> 3986.4
might be right about anything is kind of

3985.5 --> 3989.78
stupid

3986.4 --> 3989.78
You Gotta Give it that

3990.66 --> 3996.72
like this guy is

3993.079 --> 3998.9
pathological lying scumbag piece of

3996.72 --> 3998.8999999999996
trash

4004.819 --> 4007.819
anyway

4009.619 --> 4014.5
yeah let's move on Savannah oh

4016.16 --> 4021.2599999999998
yeah I think that

4017.839 --> 4022.839
Santos has some serious Savanna side

4021.26 --> 4027.079
effects

4022.839 --> 4030.52
Advanced stage that's why it is already

4027.079 --> 4030.52
partially demonic

4047.119 --> 4050.619
okay good servant

4056.299 --> 4058.48
foreign

4083.24 --> 4087.68
God

4085.28 --> 4089.8590000000004
can't believe I wasted so much time on

4087.68 --> 4089.859
this

4099.02 --> 4105.040000000001
all right just you know what just go

4101.359 --> 4105.04
watch the link that I posted

4105.44 --> 4108.5199999999995
first time here

4108.98 --> 4113.9
I've just reposted because that's a much

4111.44 --> 4117.0199999999995
much better subject

4113.9 --> 4120.759
to to actually look into

4117.02 --> 4120.759
much more worthy of your time

4130.94 --> 4134.739
the first time you watched

4135.319 --> 4141.319
okay well Terra 306 is not the first

4137.96 --> 4143.9
time I watched it for me

4141.319 --> 4146.4800000000005
but that that's certainly like the worst

4143.9 --> 4150.2789999999995
possible intro you could get to that guy

4146.48 --> 4150.2789999999995
but he deserves it

4150.52 --> 4154.6
spacebusters what's that earlier good

4155.6 --> 4161.779
I'm probably gonna watch it back again

4158.42 --> 4165.38
because this was really condensed

4161.779 --> 4168.279
I'm not saying it is a hundred percent

4165.38 --> 4168.279
foolproof

4168.319 --> 4173.179
I always expect everything to have

4171.02 --> 4174.92
errors

4173.179 --> 4178.58
but

4174.92 --> 4180.759
it really made a whole lot of sense it

4178.58 --> 4184.159
connected a whole bunch of

4180.759 --> 4186.92
memories put them together

4184.159 --> 4189.679
it like refreshing

4186.92 --> 4192.1990000000005
very quality insights that I had

4189.679 --> 4194.78
attained before and kind of

4192.199 --> 4197.08
wandered off into the background of my

4194.78 --> 4197.08
memory

4198.14 --> 4204.26
and it also pointed well at certain

4201.199 --> 4206.96
historical facts that I kind of put into

4204.26 --> 4210.62
the background as well and

4206.96 --> 4213.9800000000005
it basically corrected me in ways

4210.62 --> 4216.86
like I have to rethink my position my

4213.98 --> 4220.04
defense of medical knowledge

4216.86 --> 4222.46
what I have based on what I see what I

4220.04 --> 4222.46
saw here

4222.56 --> 4228.26
and I'm gonna

4224.48 --> 4229.159
cross reference this video with a lot of

4228.26 --> 4230.659000000001
people

4229.159 --> 4233.0
my dad

4230.659 --> 4236.44
My Healer

4233.0 --> 4236.44
I will ask them about it

4237.199 --> 4242.5
this is a better one what are you

4240.02 --> 4242.5
talking about

4245.659 --> 4249.759999999999
no no it's not

4257.42 --> 4263.42
just I

4260.36 --> 4266.299999999999
I don't need to

4263.42 --> 4269.2390000000005
actually go I just needed to see the

4266.3 --> 4272.3
title and to know no no no it's not ATM

4269.239 --> 4275.9
that one is not better absolutely not

4272.3 --> 4281.7390000000005
that one is mainstream Echo chamber

4275.9 --> 4281.739
or rather sup mainstream counter vaccine

4282.38 --> 4286.9400000000005
based

4284.54 --> 4290.36
information

4286.94 --> 4293.54
that [ __ ] is echoing everywhere

4290.36 --> 4297.219
everybody is saying that [ __ ]

4293.54 --> 4297.219
it's not super informative

4297.62 --> 4303.88
and it's about freaking shedding

4299.9 --> 4303.879999999999
shedding is a false model

4307.1 --> 4314.54
how can you say well AGM

4310.76 --> 4317.179
apparently you hadn't watched the video

4314.54 --> 4320.3
I just linked to

4317.179 --> 4322.52
because when you do and you realize the

4320.3 --> 4325.400000000001
implication of everything that is said

4322.52 --> 4327.620000000001
in that video you will know

4325.4 --> 4329.299999999999
that I was right about a couple of

4327.62 --> 4332.78
things that I stated

4329.3 --> 4335.8
that shedding is like a virus idea

4332.78 --> 4335.8
it's false

4336.32 --> 4342.44
that that can't be the way it happens

4338.9 --> 4345.32
even though people are still suggesting

4342.44 --> 4348.379999999999
like it is right

4345.32 --> 4351.259999999999
and and even more

4348.38 --> 4354.02
government lit oh so they're oh that's

4351.26 --> 4356.900000000001
is that the literature that says that

4354.02 --> 4361.040000000001
viruses are infectious as well is it is

4356.9 --> 4364.04
it part of that literature AGM

4361.04 --> 4366.76
so because the government wrote it it

4364.04 --> 4366.76
must be true

4366.86 --> 4370.36
is that really where you want to go

4387.26 --> 4392.38
what are you talking about ajm

4402.02 --> 4404.26
foreign

4423.98 --> 4431.718999999999
it's very simple she take the vaccine

4427.64 --> 4433.04
that's not a vaccine you're [ __ ]

4431.719 --> 4435.56
right

4433.04 --> 4438.56
it's not going to spread

4435.56 --> 4440.6
it can spread there's no disease that's

4438.56 --> 4443.0
going to spread

4440.6 --> 4445.280000000001
let you poison Yourself by taking the

4443.0 --> 4448.52
vaccine and then get your genetics

4445.28 --> 4451.46
altered in Spike protein building up in

4448.52 --> 4454.1
you over time yeah that's what happens

4451.46 --> 4456.8
it can't spread

4454.1 --> 4458.679
right right so

4456.8 --> 4460.76
theoretically

4458.679 --> 4463.52
theoretically it's supposed to be

4460.76 --> 4466.58
happening right Spike proteins

4463.52 --> 4469.52
palpable evidence for this

4466.58 --> 4471.739
uh yeah a whole bunch of production of

4469.52 --> 4474.320000000001
this will be happening in humans it'll

4471.739 --> 4476.9
build up it will dust people will

4474.32 --> 4480.259999999999
probably indirectly get it in their food

4476.9 --> 4483.139999999999
just from just minor traces of it right

4480.26 --> 4486.159000000001
right it might cause some slight

4483.14 --> 4488.900000000001
discomfort in the unfaccinated and yeah

4486.159 --> 4490.159
besides this Spike protein specific

4488.9 --> 4494.239
thing

4490.159 --> 4497.719
there's other side's effects

4494.239 --> 4500.54
like non-physical potentially side

4497.719 --> 4502.159
effects we're like spiritual or magnetic

4500.54 --> 4504.32
it's weird

4502.159 --> 4505.82
like yeah miscarriage has happened in

4504.32 --> 4508.219
proximity of somebody that's been

4505.82 --> 4510.92
vaccinated that right that's not because

4508.219 --> 4513.7390000000005
this Spike protein came flying in and

4510.92 --> 4515.96
then oh that no no that's not what

4513.739 --> 4518.959999999999
caused that it's something else

4515.96 --> 4522.62
right so Spike proteins are not going to

4518.96 --> 4524.719
fly around see like be become

4522.62 --> 4526.82
assimilated by your body and then your

4524.719 --> 4529.1
body starts to produce where they are

4526.82 --> 4532.719
assimilated and now you're just like to

4529.1 --> 4536.1990000000005
vaccinated no no no

4532.719 --> 4539.6
that can't happen

4536.199 --> 4542.178999999999
that's a lie

4539.6 --> 4545.120000000001
makes no sense

4542.179 --> 4548.6
look at all the effort and the chemical

4545.12 --> 4552.08
garbage weird specific toxins

4548.6 --> 4556.159000000001
that even have to accompany

4552.08 --> 4559.1
the yeah the genetic therapy in order to

4556.159 --> 4561.62
make your cells produce those Spike

4559.1 --> 4565.58
proteins right because Spike proteins

4561.62 --> 4568.28
don't just get in your body and turn a

4565.58 --> 4570.94
cell into a spike protein producer that

4568.28 --> 4570.94
doesn't happen

4572.239 --> 4574.419999999999
foreign

4582.14 --> 4587.780000000001
there's more to do probably with

4584.5 --> 4591.04
sympathetic resonance

4587.78 --> 4591.04
other distortions

4596.179 --> 4599.54
she got a muted

4598.52 --> 4601.580000000001
right

4599.54 --> 4605.42
so yes

4601.58 --> 4608.08
when there is interaction

4605.42 --> 4612.4400000000005
with a vaccinated person

4608.08 --> 4615.08
you might get weird freaky effects

4612.44 --> 4616.759999999999
a terrible effect

4615.08 --> 4619.82
right

4616.76 --> 4623.06
but then when the vaccinated person goes

4619.82 --> 4627.0199999999995
away yeah you underwent that [ __ ]

4623.06 --> 4629.42
I deem it absolutely impossible

4627.02 --> 4632.2390000000005
that you would then go back to like a

4629.42 --> 4635.679
completely unvaccinated community and

4632.239 --> 4637.9
then they would get those symptoms too

4635.679 --> 4641.4800000000005
no way

4637.9 --> 4644.36
no way no

4641.48 --> 4646.599999999999
this is my prediction of how it will go

4644.36 --> 4646.599999999999
down

4648.5 --> 4654.98
so shedding is not like a viral

4651.62 --> 4657.86
spreading that's not what it is it's

4654.98 --> 4660.5599999999995
more like something local some things

4657.86 --> 4664.339999999999
that happen when you constantly interact

4660.56 --> 4666.6990000000005
maybe I think it has to do more with the

4664.34 --> 4666.6990000000005
spirit

4668.6 --> 4676.46
but it's not something that's gonna rub

4672.08 --> 4680.239
off on you because of being with the

4676.46 --> 4682.88
vaccinated seed in you you go somewhere

4680.239 --> 4689.919999999999
else away from the vaccinated and then

4682.88 --> 4689.92
you spread it that's not going to happen

4690.08 --> 4695.739
no indication that it can

4692.96 --> 4698.54
because if it would then the real

4695.739 --> 4700.699
disasters would happen

4698.54 --> 4704.44
I don't think they can I don't think

4700.699 --> 4704.44
that's what what's what's happening

4707.06 --> 4711.9800000000005
stop

4709.34 --> 4715.76
guzzling fear porn

4711.98 --> 4718.04
let go of the virus idea

4715.76 --> 4720.320000000001
virus spreading it's constantly being

4718.04 --> 4723.76
reinforced through media

4720.32 --> 4727.9
through news [ __ ] media through

4723.76 --> 4727.900000000001
science fiction media

4728.12 --> 4734.54
through actual entertainment

4730.82 --> 4738.08
the idea oh God is a thing it's going to

4734.54 --> 4740.42
that's it it's just the idea oh God a

4738.08 --> 4743.54
thing it's going to spread

4740.42 --> 4746.54
that sentence that completely

4743.54 --> 4746.54
encapsulizes

4746.659 --> 4751.46
the what a virus is

4749.54 --> 4756.44
just that

4751.46 --> 4759.86
something it is going to spread that is

4756.44 --> 4764.659
what a virus is that idea it's purely

4759.86 --> 4767.54
that idea it seems to be very exciting

4764.659 --> 4769.94
and scary to a whole bunch of people and

4767.54 --> 4773.239
they get obsessed over it over that

4769.94 --> 4775.879999999999
formula over the formula and then they

4773.239 --> 4777.5599999999995
apply it to things where it shouldn't be

4775.88 --> 4781.34
applied

4777.56 --> 4783.56
and they create fear porn using that

4781.34 --> 4786.34
formula

4783.56 --> 4786.34
do you understand

4800.24 --> 4807.989
[Music]

4813.219 --> 4819.94
yeah whatever AGM

4817.4 --> 4819.94
whatever

4822.38 --> 4827.78
did you take what they said out of

4824.3 --> 4830.2390000000005
context because everything I've said

4827.78 --> 4831.679
would probably support what they have

4830.239 --> 4834.739
said right

4831.679 --> 4840.08
you just oversimplified it in your mind

4834.739 --> 4843.86
and reduced it to a virus format

4840.08 --> 4845.36
and then everything else leech bleached

4843.86 --> 4847.759999999999
away

4845.36 --> 4849.94
you turn it into a virus again in your

4847.76 --> 4849.9400000000005
mind

4850.28 --> 4857.0
right because I have seen a lot about of

4853.76 --> 4861.38
those lectures from people

4857.0 --> 4864.26
about shedding about weird side effects

4861.38 --> 4866.6
like spontaneous abortions from being

4864.26 --> 4870.26
what is the miscarriages from being in

4866.6 --> 4872.719
proximity of a vaccinated etc etc yeah

4870.26 --> 4875.54
this is my conclusion everything I just

4872.719 --> 4877.46
rolled out that's my conclusion from the

4875.54 --> 4881.56
preponderance of the data

4877.46 --> 4881.56
that I have attained so far

4890.54 --> 4895.76
you'd use discernment now yeah well your

4893.54 --> 4898.159
discernment sucks AGM

4895.76 --> 4902.38
you're prone

4898.159 --> 4902.379999999999
to viral thinking

4903.26 --> 4908.6
and I've seen you do that over and over

4906.44 --> 4910.58
and over again

4908.6 --> 4913.639
since I met you

4910.58 --> 4918.38
you're very prone to the idea

4913.639 --> 4920.42
you get the virus formula a thing it can

4918.38 --> 4924.08
spread out there

4920.42 --> 4927.02
and then you bind it to data you come

4924.08 --> 4928.94
across and then forget the details of

4927.02 --> 4931.1
the data and just reduce it to that

4928.94 --> 4933.138999999999
formula it's what you're doing that's

4931.1 --> 4935.900000000001
what you do

4933.139 --> 4938.32
that's how you seem to assimilate a lot

4935.9 --> 4938.32
of information

4952.58 --> 4954.699
thank you

4957.5 --> 4962.86
people taking the facts or getting

4959.659 --> 4962.86
discounted dude

4965.54 --> 4968.86
sure they will

4984.34 --> 4990.52
that's disgusting

4987.62 --> 4990.5199999999995
foreign

5021.88 --> 5026.9400000000005
all right

5023.62 --> 5026.94
facts Wars

5038.26 --> 5043.9800000000005
steamy Traveler

5041.08 --> 5043.98
I don't know

5046.06 --> 5049.860000000001
I have no idea if they do that

5050.26 --> 5057.2390000000005
I know I'm

5051.76 --> 5057.2390000000005
not going to accept that that happens

5062.26 --> 5068.56
but it might be in some specific

5065.159 --> 5071.62
extended welfare cases right I'm just

5068.56 --> 5074.76
based I'm just doing basic always have

5071.62 --> 5074.76
never more than that

5074.86 --> 5077.46
so

5090.46 --> 5100.06
but yeah uh I there was no uh

5094.96 --> 5101.8
no panel so no fine on my welfare

5100.06 --> 5104.26
thank God

5101.8 --> 5107.52
and they better not because it's in the

5104.26 --> 5107.52
freaking Constitution

5108.82 --> 5118.54
if they do that they'd literally

5112.92 --> 5120.6990000000005
violate my Dutch constitutional right

5118.54 --> 5123.54
and then they got a problem

5120.699 --> 5123.54
with me

5138.88 --> 5142.139
yeah that's right

5143.32 --> 5146.88
it's literally written

5147.46 --> 5152.46
right that means a legal basis

5153.58 --> 5159.04
you cannot violate that

5156.28 --> 5161.199
because it has to do it's basically tied

5159.04 --> 5162.58
into a conception of human writing yeah

5161.199 --> 5164.739
it's socialist

5162.58 --> 5165.94
I know it's rooted in a form of

5164.739 --> 5168.339999999999
Socialism

5165.94 --> 5170.879999999999
that doesn't automatically make it all

5168.34 --> 5170.88
communism

5172.12 --> 5179.0199999999995
although yeah it's not entirely safe

5175.6 --> 5181.360000000001
against that further development on top

5179.02 --> 5183.040000000001
of it yeah I agree but it's in the

5181.36 --> 5187.08
Constitution right now

5183.04 --> 5187.08
and that has certain implications

5187.54 --> 5191.219
it's where I rest my case

5193.96 --> 5199.659
and that's why I never

5196.42 --> 5202.42
ask more [ __ ] on top of it like oh I

5199.659 --> 5205.719
need more social welfare money because I

5202.42 --> 5208.659
have medical issues or yeah that's when

5205.719 --> 5211.8
you get into trouble I've always avoided

5208.659 --> 5211.799999999999
that at all costs

5223.54 --> 5227.199
okay

5225.3 --> 5229.2390000000005
all right

5227.199 --> 5232.44
they have guns though

5229.239 --> 5232.44
I don't give a [ __ ]

5235.3 --> 5242.219
I don't I don't care dude I don't care

5237.639 --> 5242.219
if they come with freaking armor tanks

5270.46 --> 5277.12
all right by the way I've heard

5273.46 --> 5279.699
from the streets that apparently the

5277.12 --> 5282.28
masks are being lifted

5279.699 --> 5283.96
this Sunday over here in the Netherlands

5282.28 --> 5288.42
hooray

5283.96 --> 5288.42
I was never really wearing a mask anyway

5289.0 --> 5294.699
except at the coffee shop because the

5291.4 --> 5297.58
boss there is yeah

5294.699 --> 5300.58
certain hat size

5297.58 --> 5304.54
and yeah

5300.58 --> 5306.34
he just demands doing that and he yeah

5304.54 --> 5308.92
you can tell him like yeah but the

5306.34 --> 5311.08
government specifically says that you

5308.92 --> 5312.6990000000005
see I have an exemption card he will

5311.08 --> 5316.0599999999995
just not accept that

5312.699 --> 5318.159
because of his specific hat size

5316.06 --> 5319.360000000001
there's literally nothing I could do

5318.159 --> 5321.5199999999995
about it

5319.36 --> 5323.38
so that's the only place I'd ever had to

5321.52 --> 5326.02
wear a mask so far

5323.38 --> 5329.38
uh

5326.02 --> 5333.280000000001
but over there now I won't have to

5329.38 --> 5335.7390000000005
anymore either so hooray finally the

5333.28 --> 5337.84
mess comes off that I really never had

5335.739 --> 5340.299999999999
to wear anyway

5337.84 --> 5344.92
I hope a lot of people really take it

5340.3 --> 5347.38
off because it's just bad for you

5344.92 --> 5348.9400000000005
I really hope people here do and they're

5347.38 --> 5352.2390000000005
not like oh I'm gonna still wear it

5348.94 --> 5357.12
because I believe the news it could be

5352.239 --> 5357.12
dangerous a new variant could spread

5358.6 --> 5361.4400000000005
anyway

5392.26 --> 5397.84
oh God yeah I did didn't he

5395.739 --> 5401.62
I almost forgot about but it's so

5397.84 --> 5406.900000000001
ridiculous Biden threatening the like

5401.62 --> 5408.82
the nuke in the U.S it's it's what

5406.9 --> 5411.96
come on man

5408.82 --> 5411.96
so ridiculous

5412.42 --> 5417.4800000000005
besides nukes don't really exist like

5415.06 --> 5417.4800000000005
that anyway

5417.88 --> 5423.719
but just the idea is so ridiculous

5432.699 --> 5435.299999999999
hmm

5443.139 --> 5450.0
uh

5444.94 --> 5450.0
mystery mongoose shut up dude

5450.639 --> 5457.179
flat tired nonsense

5454.06 --> 5459.54
so what about it exactly is nonsense

5457.179 --> 5459.54
right

5460.36 --> 5464.5199999999995
tell me mystery mongoose

5466.78 --> 5470.759999999999
can you be more specific

5477.12 --> 5481.32
oh yeah you're getting out of here

5481.96 --> 5486.58
yeah there's no flat Earth debate live

5484.0 --> 5489.1
today so they all just woke up in a

5486.58 --> 5492.9
cranky mood figuring out they can't

5489.1 --> 5492.900000000001
squirt over Nathan's

5496.78 --> 5501.5199999999995
their favorite dominatrix is suddenly

5499.78 --> 5504.96
not appeared

5501.52 --> 5504.96
so they come over here

5511.38 --> 5514.529
[Music]

5519.92 --> 5523.01
[Music]

5526.42 --> 5530.34
your [ __ ] gloves ouch

5530.62 --> 5533.58
too much information

5533.739 --> 5536.5199999999995
uh

5540.94 --> 5546.159
when did you know there's no live fed

5543.46 --> 5549.78
before I started the show Nathan

5546.159 --> 5549.78
mentioned it in the chat

5553.84 --> 5557.46
like before 12 o'clock

5571.78 --> 5579.46
brilliant yeah it seems like mystery

5574.9 --> 5582.04
Mongoose was just being a dumbass

5579.46 --> 5584.38
because I did ask him like can you be

5582.04 --> 5586.6
more specific and now he's just stop

5584.38 --> 5588.88
talking

5586.6 --> 5589.780000000001
well at least that means that he would

5588.88 --> 5592.7390000000005
be

5589.78 --> 5592.739
listening

5595.42 --> 5601.86
and then wise enough to shut the hell up

5598.54 --> 5601.86
because he doesn't know [ __ ]

5604.98 --> 5611.08
anyway I'll be back in two minutes

5609.219 --> 5613.8
after that I'll still have like a half

5611.08 --> 5613.8
hour or something

5615.88 --> 5618.78
foreign

5647.739 --> 5650.5199999999995
foreign

5699.94 --> 5702.94
foreign

5722.8 --> 5725.58
wow

5733.0 --> 5739.06
it's it's it's worse Derek like I'm

5736.659 --> 5740.86
really disappointed with just how lame

5739.06 --> 5743.860000000001
these trolls are

5740.86 --> 5746.5
because they just say oh so stupid

5743.86 --> 5748.239
it's so stupid that's it that's the only

5746.5 --> 5751.48
thing they say

5748.239 --> 5753.5199999999995
you can't actually ask them anything

5751.48 --> 5756.099999999999
they don't they can't even give an

5753.52 --> 5758.5
examples as to why

5756.1 --> 5760.360000000001
flat earthers or however they call it

5758.5 --> 5764.86
are supposedly stupid

5760.36 --> 5767.199
they literally are like the most vacant

5764.86 --> 5769.54
dumb asses ever and they're a waste of

5767.199 --> 5771.759999999999
space because hey if they actually had

5769.54 --> 5774.76
some kind of an opinion

5771.76 --> 5777.639
and some knowledge to reflect on then I

5774.76 --> 5779.56
might have a conversation like I like to

5777.639 --> 5782.26
do with really

5779.56 --> 5784.96
trollish people or like people that are

5782.26 --> 5786.34
very much annoyed by Flat Earth

5784.96 --> 5787.96
right

5786.34 --> 5791.02
they have some

5787.96 --> 5793.0
character if they have some training if

5791.02 --> 5797.320000000001
they have some knowledge

5793.0 --> 5800.08
then yeah I just address it I just

5797.32 --> 5802.54
inquire

5800.08 --> 5805.179
test the person

5802.54 --> 5808.0
but these people if they're even people

5805.179 --> 5810.88
they're just they don't know anything

5808.0 --> 5812.02
they just say some stupid little short

5810.88 --> 5814.119
sentence

5812.02 --> 5816.4800000000005
and you can't really interact with any

5814.119 --> 5816.48
of it

5818.94 --> 5826.78
it's just like closed off catchphrases

5823.3 --> 5828.639
and that's it there's no interaction

5826.78 --> 5831.94
they don't know how to communicate

5828.639 --> 5834.58
they're totally Spellbound they don't

5831.94 --> 5836.5599999999995
know what the hell's going on anymore

5834.58 --> 5837.699
they just have this superficial sense

5836.56 --> 5840.34
like

5837.699 --> 5842.86
this is the right thing to do we have to

5840.34 --> 5844.900000000001
ridicule this don't know why it's too

5842.86 --> 5848.139
scary uh

5844.9 --> 5850.96
just act like you're smarter

5848.139 --> 5852.34
but they have no information available

5850.96 --> 5854.9800000000005
to them

5852.34 --> 5859.32
they can't actually discuss things

5854.98 --> 5859.32
they're totally Spellbound

5859.54 --> 5865.719
acting confident actually being scared

5864.159 --> 5869.32
and

5865.719 --> 5873.0
having a sensation of helplessness

5869.32 --> 5873.0
is what they really are

5873.699 --> 5880.0599999999995
really small-minded actors and they are

5877.78 --> 5881.139
acting like they actually know what the

5880.06 --> 5883.780000000001
hell they're doing

5881.139 --> 5886.84
they just want that sensation within the

5883.78 --> 5889.36
social Act of feeling smart for a bit

5886.84 --> 5890.679
they're not smart they don't know

5889.36 --> 5892.599999999999
anything

5890.679 --> 5895.84
because you can't communicate with them

5892.6 --> 5898.42
they just say stupid closed off

5895.84 --> 5901.1990000000005
catchphrases

5898.42 --> 5901.1990000000005
that's it

5904.6 --> 5908.9400000000005
and I yeah I'm bored with that

5912.28 --> 5919.619
so yeah you can go too bye now if any

5916.54 --> 5923.739
baller would like to address anything

5919.619 --> 5926.44
and an argument maybe you know maybe

5923.739 --> 5928.0
some event might be going on some rocket

5926.44 --> 5931.119
launch or something I'll even talk about

5928.0 --> 5934.26
that you know anything but just having

5931.119 --> 5936.82
to stare at really stupid closed off

5934.26 --> 5938.860000000001
catchphrases from people that don't know

5936.82 --> 5941.92
how to communicate

5938.86 --> 5945.58
or discuss information

5941.92 --> 5949.139
those people need to get the [ __ ] out

5945.58 --> 5949.139
stop wasting my time

5957.14 --> 5966.52
[Music]

5963.3 --> 5970.679
apotheosis must include thesis

5966.52 --> 5970.679
and made this true what

5980.26 --> 5988.06
I don't think that him doing it made it

5983.739 --> 5991.239
true Jesus just revealed what was true

5988.06 --> 5993.6990000000005
he showed he showed the way

5991.239 --> 5996.58
literally and metaphorically

5993.699 --> 5998.799999999999
esoterically

5996.58 --> 6001.98
he opened up a door

5998.8 --> 6005.1
that hadn't been open

6001.98 --> 6007.678999999999
in that time he opened the door of a

6005.1 --> 6011.46
whole bunch of forgotten things

6007.679 --> 6014.219
and gave showed a way

6011.46 --> 6016.5
revealed a path that before was not

6014.219 --> 6019.639
known was not seen

6016.5 --> 6022.02
for people to follow certain

6019.639 --> 6024.9800000000005
instructions based on specific

6022.02 --> 6024.9800000000005
philosophy

6025.56 --> 6030.06
principles

6027.119 --> 6035.5199999999995
to uphold principles to follow them

6030.06 --> 6038.400000000001
to see your experience as a test

6035.52 --> 6041.820000000001
and to realize there is seductions and

6038.4 --> 6045.199
there is Corruptions and all that all

6041.82 --> 6045.199
that knowledge all together

6045.42 --> 6049.76
that is what Jesus revealed

6053.4 --> 6059.879999999999
and yeah sure dude look other

6057.619 --> 6061.98
similar figures

6059.88 --> 6064.9800000000005
out there

6061.98 --> 6066.239
in other religions in other regions yeah

6064.98 --> 6070.099999999999
sure

6066.239 --> 6070.099999999999
right I'm all for that

6070.86 --> 6073.639
why not

6073.739 --> 6081.0599999999995
why would he be the only one to do such

6077.46 --> 6083.52
a thing right to reveal

6081.06 --> 6086.2390000000005
that which was figured out through

6083.52 --> 6086.2390000000005
enlightenment

6098.639 --> 6101.639
wow

6119.28 --> 6123.599999999999
yeah Kevin Horizons that's right and

6121.92 --> 6126.119
that's saying

6123.6 --> 6128.219
basically sums up

6126.119 --> 6131.36
in a shortened version

6128.219 --> 6131.36
kind of what I said

6131.4 --> 6137.46
father the Creator the designer the way

6134.88 --> 6139.38
he designed things

6137.46 --> 6141.84
you won't

6139.38 --> 6144.06
get to enjoy

6141.84 --> 6146.28
creation properly

6144.06 --> 6151.7390000000005
as it was designed

6146.28 --> 6154.199
if not through his methods through his

6151.739 --> 6157.28
example that's what he's saying right

6154.199 --> 6161.9
there and it's true

6157.28 --> 6165.0
esoterically it's true right now I know

6161.9 --> 6167.28
exoterics have been applied to that

6165.0 --> 6169.02
saying endlessly and I was like oh no

6167.28 --> 6171.36
there's a trinity and now it's all about

6169.02 --> 6175.26
who is who and

6171.36 --> 6178.5599999999995
not anymore about the actual esoteric

6175.26 --> 6182.400000000001
wider implicated structure of what it

6178.56 --> 6186.54
means when he says that I am the way

6182.4 --> 6189.659
and the truth and the life no one comes

6186.54 --> 6195.3
to the father except through me if you

6189.659 --> 6196.08
really know me know me not believe know

6195.3 --> 6200.1
me

6196.08 --> 6202.699
you will know my father as well

6200.1 --> 6202.6990000000005
see

6203.82 --> 6209.599999999999
thank you for posting that Kevin

6206.1 --> 6209.6
Horizons I appreciate that

6211.5 --> 6214.5
foreign

6222.76 --> 6225.9490000000005
[Music]

6227.04 --> 6230.88
yeah well George Sanford I don't care if

6229.139 --> 6233.659000000001
he's the personification of the sun

6230.88 --> 6233.659000000001
that's fine

6234.119 --> 6238.92
that does not undo

6236.34 --> 6242.1
the pattern

6238.92 --> 6246.4800000000005
right that personification

6242.1 --> 6249.06
right does not mean he was not a person

6246.48 --> 6251.638999999999
if you claim that through that sentence

6249.06 --> 6254.360000000001
then you are literally acting

6251.639 --> 6254.36
satanically

6262.32 --> 6267.719
right because in a Celestial schematic

6265.98 --> 6270.54
context yeah

6267.719 --> 6272.46
Jesus is the son that's right in that

6270.54 --> 6276.179
setup he is

6272.46 --> 6278.88
does that mean he is only the sun

6276.179 --> 6283.38
whatever it is that non-local light

6278.88 --> 6286.1
based weird energy riddled phenomenon

6283.38 --> 6286.1
no

6287.52 --> 6294.56
if you exclude the other things then you

6290.82 --> 6294.5599999999995
are making a problem for yourself

6302.34 --> 6307.92
do you think Jesus is our older brother

6305.34 --> 6309.900000000001
that's interesting that's very

6307.92 --> 6313.38
interesting perspective steamy traveler

6309.9 --> 6315.54
in an esoteric sense that doesn't really

6313.38 --> 6317.400000000001
feel all that bad

6315.54 --> 6319.88
an older brother

6317.4 --> 6319.879999999999
right

6320.88 --> 6326.219
that could work for me I never heard

6323.82 --> 6328.44
Mormons say that though and I did hang

6326.219 --> 6332.119
around with him a bit

6328.44 --> 6332.119
but I have no objection

6332.88 --> 6339.06
if you want to refer to Jesus Christ as

6336.42 --> 6342.02
your older brother then spiritually yeah

6339.06 --> 6342.02
why not

6343.679 --> 6350.04
I don't think it has any really

6346.159 --> 6352.5599999999995
important esoteric value to call him

6350.04 --> 6356.42
older brother I'm just saying no that's

6352.56 --> 6356.42
fine I don't see a problem there

6378.3 --> 6384.96
Terry 306 most movie titles begin with

6381.48 --> 6386.5199999999995
the why well because they want to be

6384.96 --> 6389.76
the

6386.52 --> 6394.02
they want to be foremost if you are the

6389.76 --> 6397.619000000001
then you are suggesting I am the I am

6394.02 --> 6400.4400000000005
the most I am the ultimate example of

6397.619 --> 6402.599999999999
this thing right that's why most movies

6400.44 --> 6407.28
like to start with thee because they

6402.6 --> 6409.5
want to be special boy D is is sort of a

6407.28 --> 6412.139
bit of a special boy trick

6409.5 --> 6414.659
I am the like

6412.139 --> 6416.1
to be fair like I say I am the

6414.659 --> 6417.299999999999
cosmogenist

6416.1 --> 6420.3
right

6417.3 --> 6422.88
and I do do that to myself I do say yeah

6420.3 --> 6426.6
I am

6422.88 --> 6429.5
I am exclusive like that because I

6426.6 --> 6429.5
haven't met an equal

6431.34 --> 6436.46
but that's why most movies like to use

6434.159 --> 6436.46
the

6440.159 --> 6444.0199999999995
theology now that's not

6444.06 --> 6446.2390000000005
foreign

6449.639 --> 6455.400000000001
theologic

6452.219 --> 6458.2390000000005
Theo God

6455.4 --> 6458.239
logos

6460.679 --> 6466.159
you want to be a wizard or Alchemy I

6463.02 --> 6466.159000000001
don't want to be an alchemist

6466.56 --> 6472.1990000000005
I I would like prefer to refer to what I

6470.34 --> 6473.400000000001
do as wizard

6472.199 --> 6476.5199999999995
if

6473.4 --> 6479.159
although yeah the problem is though that

6476.52 --> 6482.280000000001
the idea of wizard has become kind of

6479.159 --> 6486.0599999999995
like entangled with somebody

6482.28 --> 6489.259999999999
that will spout Illusions and I find

6486.06 --> 6489.26
this very unfortunate

6491.28 --> 6497.04
I I hope I'm not being seen I just could

6495.659 --> 6499.5599999999995
I don't know how

6497.04 --> 6503.54
but I'm not an Illusionist quite the

6499.56 --> 6503.54
opposite I'm a diviner

6511.56 --> 6517.46
and a paladin

6513.54 --> 6517.46
just some serious implications

6545.239 --> 6550.638999999999
who made this example just include

6551.659 --> 6558.138999999999
multiple headed figurine

6555.48 --> 6558.138999999999
what

6561.119 --> 6564.0599999999995
I

6562.679 --> 6567.599
I

6564.06 --> 6569.04
what are you saying gaining wisdom I

6567.599 --> 6571.400000000001
don't understand exactly what you're

6569.04 --> 6571.4
talking about

6587.639 --> 6594.4400000000005
right so when you see a multiple headed

6589.98 --> 6594.44
figurine right like my Brahma statue

6594.78 --> 6599.699
guy

6596.96 --> 6603.4800000000005
does that actually mean

6599.699 --> 6605.5199999999995
that he literally had all those heads

6603.48 --> 6608.218999999999
literally

6605.52 --> 6610.820000000001
or is it a symbol

6608.219 --> 6610.82
for

6611.639 --> 6618.26
character Dynamics

6614.719 --> 6622.94
multiple types

6618.26 --> 6622.9400000000005
personalities within the person

6623.76 --> 6629.52
you know

6626.3 --> 6631.92
because I in myself recognized I have

6629.52 --> 6634.46
multiple characters I have multiple

6631.92 --> 6634.46
faces

6634.86 --> 6641.4
spiritually

6636.84 --> 6644.159000000001
ways I can be but they all abide by the

6641.4 --> 6646.5
the singular laws

6644.159 --> 6649.98
and so you got Baldwin

6646.5 --> 6653.4
right who who is kind of breaking the

6649.98 --> 6655.919999999999
law in a way but he's like

6653.4 --> 6657.54
he is he's already been arrested he is

6655.92 --> 6660.92
in the golden cage

6657.54 --> 6663.48
right and I'm honest about it so

6660.92 --> 6665.4
multiple faces

6663.48 --> 6669.239
can be

6665.4 --> 6671.94
to me easily translated to

6669.239 --> 6674.218999999999
different personalities

6671.94 --> 6677.699
whether they are under control and aware

6674.219 --> 6679.7390000000005
of each other or just yeah this

6677.699 --> 6683.58
different faces different ways of

6679.739 --> 6685.98
composition and character flow and how

6683.58 --> 6688.32
you think and respond different

6685.98 --> 6691.759999999999
approaches and then that could represent

6688.32 --> 6691.759999999999
multiple phases right

6692.34 --> 6698.900000000001
and then esoterically it would be like

6694.679 --> 6702.78
oh this is the the woman type in a guy

6698.9 --> 6706.259999999999
potentially and this is the child I was

6702.78 --> 6708.36
really young how he was and this is the

6706.26 --> 6711.599
the fatherly

6708.36 --> 6714.199
attitude the father face

6711.599 --> 6714.1990000000005
right

6716.28 --> 6721.5599999999995
there's multiple ways to represent

6718.56 --> 6724.02
multiple faces that could mean it

6721.56 --> 6726.360000000001
doesn't necessarily or

6724.02 --> 6728.52
I don't I have never seen an example

6726.36 --> 6730.679
where it would literally represent

6728.52 --> 6733.099
literal multiple faces in the physical

6730.679 --> 6733.099
world

6742.86 --> 6745.94
see you later tiny

6771.119 --> 6776.219
yeah AGM I'm sure that if you get the

6773.82 --> 6779.28
Indian variant you're all going to start

6776.219 --> 6781.9800000000005
to use fake Indian accents

6779.28 --> 6785.099
chronically

6781.98 --> 6786.9
it will alter your characteristics so

6785.099 --> 6789.599
that you will literally start to talk

6786.9 --> 6792.619
like an Indian person is going to be

6789.599 --> 6792.619000000001
really embarrassing

6793.86 --> 6796.4
right

6826.08 --> 6832.82
all right just like everybody that

6828.36 --> 6832.82
catches the Chinese virus

6833.58 --> 6837.9
they all start to talk

6836.159 --> 6839.699
Chinese

6837.9 --> 6841.92
right

6839.699 --> 6844.08
there's very few cases actually because

6841.92 --> 6845.219
most cases are just false positives and

6844.08 --> 6847.679
she hadn't

6845.219 --> 6851.159
you just get the flu

6847.679 --> 6853.08
but the people that really got it they

6851.159 --> 6855.739
actually turned into permanent Chinese

6853.08 --> 6855.739
character

6871.25 --> 6874.46
[Music]

6882.3 --> 6885.139
foreign

6903.659 --> 6907.28
the old China lad

6910.86 --> 6915.0689999999995
all right

6911.79 --> 6915.069
[Music]

6920.4 --> 6927.179
yeah

6922.86 --> 6930.179
right hm remember just like the

6927.179 --> 6932.6990000000005
the that that skit with the guy taking

6930.179 --> 6934.679
the vaccine yeah like I just took the

6932.699 --> 6936.419999999999
vaccine and then it like he ends up

6934.679 --> 6938.639
literally talking like

6936.42 --> 6941.099
Chinese person

6938.639 --> 6943.26
he did a pretty good job it might have

6941.099 --> 6946.32
each actually started literally talking

6943.26 --> 6948.56
Chinese I don't remember but yeah that

6946.32 --> 6948.5599999999995
one

6949.199 --> 6954.32
so I'm not the first one to think of

6951.54 --> 6954.32
this type of joke

6958.75 --> 6964.94
[Music]

6961.44 --> 6964.94
yeah sure you can laugh at it

6966.06 --> 6971.76
if it's actually funny and silly

6969.48 --> 6973.259999999999
right because the real situation isn't

6971.76 --> 6975.900000000001
really all that funny

6973.26 --> 6978.06
the people's misunderstanding of just

6975.9 --> 6980.42
how things work are being used against

6978.06 --> 6980.42
them

6980.52 --> 6988.820000000001
by people that apparently are think

6984.3 --> 6988.820000000001
they should prioritize the population

6989.46 --> 6994.86
over enlightenment

6992.04 --> 6997.0199999999995
which is extremely foolish and has been

6994.86 --> 6999.239
empirically proven throughout history is

6997.02 --> 7001.219
counterproductive because every people

6999.239 --> 7003.739
that actually get attacked

7001.219 --> 7006.32
they get more dangerous

7003.739 --> 7009.218999999999
if you attack fertility they will

7006.32 --> 7009.219
reproduce more

7010.04 --> 7014.42
right

7011.179 --> 7016.159
it's all foolish when true Enlightenment

7014.42 --> 7017.599
has always proven that if you really

7016.159 --> 7021.699
enlighten

7017.599 --> 7021.6990000000005
then you will start to

7022.159 --> 7027.92
take more responsibility and and then

7026.0 --> 7030.86
yeah

7027.92 --> 7033.1990000000005
get less children I guess right it

7030.86 --> 7036.92
balances

7033.199 --> 7038.54
because when she when you're living in a

7036.92 --> 7040.9400000000005
shitty country with shitty culture

7038.54 --> 7043.219
everybody's really poor and aggressive

7040.94 --> 7045.32
yeah you're going to produce reproduce

7043.219 --> 7047.78
because you need your kids

7045.32 --> 7050.0
you need them to survive

7047.78 --> 7051.86
and they that sounds terrible they can

7050.0 --> 7054.5
be labor forces it could literally mean

7051.86 --> 7057.32
the difference between life and death

7054.5 --> 7060.44
food or no food right so you need to do

7057.32 --> 7062.719
it that's that's what it is like

7060.44 --> 7065.0
to really live in poor countries it's

7062.719 --> 7069.7390000000005
dangerous and you got to get the kids or

7065.0 --> 7072.86
or it's over right well when that goes

7069.739 --> 7076.4
away and things actually develop

7072.86 --> 7080.0
people get more educated or more credit

7076.4 --> 7083.0
and educated tough word to use right now

7080.0 --> 7085.28
they get more sensible they learn more

7083.0 --> 7089.179
real knowledge they they attain more

7085.28 --> 7091.759999999999
real skills then at some point

7089.179 --> 7095.119
they will

7091.76 --> 7097.159000000001
just no longer be surrendered to that

7095.119 --> 7098.839999999999
poverty mechanism of getting a lot of

7097.159 --> 7101.36
kids to survive because they're just

7098.84 --> 7103.639
doing great and they have skills and

7101.36 --> 7104.78
they can teach their own kids to have

7103.639 --> 7108.139
skills

7104.78 --> 7110.42
and then keep out of that poverty cycle

7108.139 --> 7112.9400000000005
right so that is actually more

7110.42 --> 7115.28
stabilizing to the population than

7112.94 --> 7118.098999999999
trying to actively

7115.28 --> 7120.32
get rid of people

7118.099 --> 7122.7390000000005
and I've been saying this even like at

7120.32 --> 7122.739
the beginning

7134.36 --> 7139.46
like enlightenment

7137.48 --> 7143.659
creates

7139.46 --> 7145.699
population stabilization in a good way

7143.659 --> 7149.78
because people will start to basically

7145.699 --> 7152.9
have yeah have more planned ways of kids

7149.78 --> 7155.78
not talking about freaking abortion as

7152.9 --> 7158.54
long as everybody's still like

7155.78 --> 7160.159
going overboard sexual addictions yet

7158.54 --> 7162.38
still going to be problems they're going

7160.159 --> 7163.4
to also be diseases and [ __ ] because of

7162.38 --> 7166.88
that

7163.4 --> 7171.739
but if there's just more or less poverty

7166.88 --> 7174.92
more development more skills to teach

7171.739 --> 7178.638999999999
more culture good culture positive

7174.92 --> 7181.159
Christ pattern-based culture

7178.639 --> 7184.099
encouragement to do good to defend the

7181.159 --> 7188.5599999999995
innocent etc etc then

7184.099 --> 7188.56
population will stabilize

7188.9 --> 7196.04
I want to all die out

7192.08 --> 7200.42
it won't go Overkill and then oh we are

7196.04 --> 7203.0
leaving so we need to no it will

7200.42 --> 7206.659
stabilize

7203.0 --> 7210.5
right so all this eugenic [ __ ]

7206.659 --> 7212.48
it's all [ __ ] it's all a lie it doesn't

7210.5 --> 7215.56
actually achieve

7212.48 --> 7215.5599999999995
the goals

7216.739 --> 7220.239
it's stupid

7230.26 --> 7234.88
ah yes down in 80 12.

7236.9 --> 7240.32
uh I did

7238.4 --> 7243.5199999999995
although yeah

7240.32 --> 7243.5199999999995
it's the other way around though

7243.8 --> 7248.2390000000005
if you get the jab then you don't get

7246.08 --> 7250.28
the point you didn't get the actual

7248.239 --> 7252.759999999999
point of what it is what they're doing

7250.28 --> 7252.759999999999
to you

7254.36 --> 7257.259999999999
all right anyway

7298.04 --> 7302.78
right

7299.9 --> 7304.699
I think I'm gonna round out the show

7302.78 --> 7306.44
it's been a really good show I think

7304.699 --> 7310.098999999999
though I made some really good points

7306.44 --> 7312.678999999999
went in some really refined details

7310.099 --> 7315.92
and laying down the esoterics again

7312.679 --> 7318.4
because explaining esoterics is really

7315.92 --> 7318.4
difficult

7318.98 --> 7324.5599999999995
right anybody can attempt it and just

7322.639 --> 7326.2390000000005
point out structures that make a lot of

7324.56 --> 7328.6990000000005
sense to them and then they will start

7326.239 --> 7332.839999999999
to Railroad it by that understanding but

7328.699 --> 7335.119
to actually explain in a meta fashion

7332.84 --> 7339.52
not pinning down

7335.119 --> 7339.5199999999995
esoterics is really difficult

7343.219 --> 7346.9
although I'm getting better at it

7353.36 --> 7357.04
I hope you guys agree

7358.52 --> 7364.76
and if you did then please don't forget

7401.659 --> 7407.78
a little late so I just

7403.46 --> 7409.88
just passed the two hour stream mark

7407.78 --> 7413.3
it's not the longest show I've had a

7409.88 --> 7415.6990000000005
three and a half hour show one time

7413.3 --> 7417.860000000001
that's it some time ago when I was

7415.699 --> 7419.659
really in heavy energy mood

7417.86 --> 7422.299999999999
anyway

7419.659 --> 7424.699
yeah no flat Earth debates live today

7426.639 --> 7433.46
uh I will be back tomorrow with flat

7430.4 --> 7436.879999999999
Earth early bird number 936 on the

7433.46 --> 7439.54
Saturday so it's going to be 2 P.M

7436.88 --> 7443.0
uh

7439.54 --> 7445.82
#mifa indeed here we go again

7443.0 --> 7448.94
and yeah again thanks everybody for

7445.82 --> 7453.5599999999995
being in the chat I really appreciate

7448.94 --> 7456.619
you guys and you've all come a long way

7453.56 --> 7458.900000000001
you're all doing great individually like

7456.619 --> 7460.88
pretty much everybody here in chat

7458.9 --> 7463.219
that I'm familiar with and you're all

7460.88 --> 7464.56
familiar with each other by now I think

7463.219 --> 7467.599
you all

7464.56 --> 7470.3
deserve a compliment

7467.599 --> 7472.639
because you are all doing well

7470.3 --> 7474.860000000001
from the whole spectrum of what you've

7472.639 --> 7477.4400000000005
been through

7474.86 --> 7480.44
swings and the mistakes and the argument

7477.44 --> 7484.04
you're you seem to all be doing really

7480.44 --> 7487.04
well and seeing more I can feel it off

7484.04 --> 7488.96
you I feel you understand more and it

7487.04 --> 7491.44
makes me happy because it gives me the

7488.96 --> 7491.44
sensation

7491.78 --> 7498.139
like I'm not all doing this for nothing

7494.36 --> 7501.799999999999
that we're all ascending

7498.139 --> 7504.7390000000005
gradually slowly together piece by piece

7501.8 --> 7508.099
and yeah the real insight the real

7504.739 --> 7509.839999999999
understanding is always always comes

7508.099 --> 7512.119000000001
Through Time

7509.84 --> 7514.88
wisdom comes with time

7512.119 --> 7516.259999999999
but you gotta take it serious

7514.88 --> 7518.54
because if you don't take anything

7516.26 --> 7520.280000000001
serious then yeah there will be no

7518.54 --> 7523.579
wisdom revealed

7520.28 --> 7525.199
in time only works if you take things

7523.579 --> 7527.36
serious

7525.199 --> 7529.219
right doesn't mean that you can't joke

7527.36 --> 7531.98
around every now and then of course this

7529.219 --> 7535.52
is in the moment having fun is also good

7531.98 --> 7538.759999999999
morality key factor in health

7535.52 --> 7540.860000000001
how medical information is revealing

7538.76 --> 7545.1990000000005
that more and more and more morality is

7540.86 --> 7545.199
everything so anyway

7546.02 --> 7550.4800000000005
uh yeah

7548.239 --> 7556.579
take it easy everybody

7550.48 --> 7557.969999999999
and until the next video keep it flat

7556.579 --> 7587.869
foreign

7557.97 --> 7587.869000000001
