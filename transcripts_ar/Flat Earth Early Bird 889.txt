and tom parker first in chat

148.16 --> 155.35999999999999
so i'm still a little dreamy because

151.92 --> 159.11999999999998
i overslept because i had

155.36 --> 161.92000000000002
a lot of dream well this night

159.12 --> 163.36
like a lot of it it it was just a bit of

161.92 --> 166.72
a weird night

163.36 --> 166.72000000000003
stayed up pretty late

168.56 --> 172.4
watched all kinds of movies but just

171.36 --> 175.28
like i was

172.4 --> 178.87900000000002
dreaming a lot i i kind of felt it felt

175.28 --> 182.8
it coming i took extra fish oil

178.879 --> 185.599
some magnesium and i just knew

182.8 --> 187.44
like i'm gonna have a lot of dreaming

185.599 --> 188.56
and i did it it was kind of funny

187.44 --> 190.48
because like even

188.56 --> 192.239
as i was dreaming and i don't remember

190.48 --> 194.56
the full detail of it was a fourth

192.239 --> 197.44
dimensional experience

194.56 --> 199.68
which i wasn't supposed to be exactly

197.44 --> 201.76
remembering

199.68 --> 204.48000000000002
but i do remember that even within the

201.76 --> 204.48
experience

205.2 --> 208.72
at some point it was like hey you need

207.04 --> 212.0
to do your show

208.72 --> 215.28
like what oh damn so i woke

212.0 --> 215.28
up like

217.76 --> 224.64
like this and it's weird because i

220.799 --> 228.72
i kind of wanted to kept going

224.64 --> 231.44
it was very intense and pleasant and

228.72 --> 231.84
like there were all kinds of things out

231.44 --> 235.04
there

231.84 --> 237.519
like i felt my mother was there even

235.04 --> 239.35999999999999
like in the dream it was like there it

237.519 --> 242.48000000000002
was the sense of like a weird

239.36 --> 246.64000000000001
family gathering

242.48 --> 250.79899999999998
but my family from a long time ago

246.64 --> 255.83999999999997
yeah bit of a dark world experience

250.799 --> 255.84
one could say but it was pretty good

256.4 --> 265.35999999999996
it was almost like a come together

260.959 --> 268.4
to tell me like yeah you've

265.36 --> 271.04
you've resolved

268.4 --> 272.479
a lot yeah it felt like a resolving

271.04 --> 276.32
dream in a lot of ways

272.479 --> 278.32
like for me to come to peace

276.32 --> 279.759
with a lot of that a lot of things that

278.32 --> 283.84
have happened

279.759 --> 288.72
during my life tied in

283.84 --> 290.0
to the the dark world about creation

288.72 --> 293.199
of things that have been running

290.0 --> 293.199
throughout my life and

294.0 --> 300.16
i'm still in the dream

297.36 --> 301.84000000000003
yeah i woke up physically but i feel i'm

300.16 --> 305.91900000000004
still in there

301.84 --> 309.84
right now it's yeah

305.919 --> 313.19899999999996
but i feel good though a little woozy

309.84 --> 315.19899999999996
right and he hadn't

313.199 --> 316.8
like been drinking or anything in the

315.199 --> 320.24
night so that's not

for my doing because i was just

350.32 --> 353.84
constantly hungry yesterday

353.919 --> 366.15999999999997
especially like for this kind of stuff

356.72 --> 381.84000000000003
this tumeric drink

366.16 --> 381.84000000000003
hello rest ahead

392.4 --> 398.08
in my dreams and even remember that like

395.6 --> 400.08000000000004

404.88 --> 409.36
but it's kind of funny yeah i saw my

406.479 --> 413.039
mother again and remembered it

409.36 --> 415.36
during during mother's day

413.039 --> 417.68
i was like celebrated it in my dreams or

415.36 --> 420.88
something

417.68 --> 424.88
oh four days of insomnia sheesh

420.88 --> 424.88
rest that why is that

425.84 --> 432.56
i i don't have trouble with that so far

429.68 --> 436.16
it's more like getting up although i did

432.56 --> 438.16
get to bed pretty late

436.16 --> 440.56
but i don't know it's also because it's

438.16 --> 443.44
just it's so

440.56 --> 444.639
hot and moist a lot and like especially

443.44 --> 446.96
the moist part

444.639 --> 449.28000000000003
it's very annoying to try and sleep in

446.96 --> 449.28
that

455.28 --> 460.15999999999997
right and it's not fully summer heat

458.24 --> 464.0
just yet but with the moist

460.16 --> 466.8
it is kind of it's kind of like a

464.0 --> 466.8
summery night

467.44 --> 472.24
hurt the bird again

470.479 --> 474.4
which i don't know what type of bird it

472.24 --> 474.40000000000003
is

474.639 --> 481.759
it just starts doing its song

478.319 --> 483.68
like at three o'clock at night

481.759 --> 486.879
seems to be doing that specifically at

483.68 --> 486.879
that time i don't know why

488.639 --> 495.919
blasting heavy frequency in my area

493.12 --> 498.319
right well that might be well not heavy

495.919 --> 501.28
but there might be some

498.319 --> 504.56
weird things going on here too but yeah

501.28 --> 504.55999999999995
it's in the middle of a city

505.28 --> 510.55999999999995
it didn't bother me too much though

508.4 --> 512.64
sometimes at night when i try to go to

510.56 --> 515.919
sleep

512.64 --> 515.919
especially when i'm like

516.8 --> 520.0799999999999
loaded up on thc then i kind of like

519.599 --> 525.9200000000001
have

520.08 --> 529.76
weird feelings like sensations of sounds

525.92 --> 529.76
that seem to like kind of want to

530.399 --> 534.16
get in my way and then i kind of like

533.839 --> 536.9590000000001
work

534.16 --> 539.4399999999999
through it it didn't really bother me

536.959 --> 539.4399999999999
this night

542.399 --> 549.839
this is having bad night sweats hmm

554.399 --> 558.24
all right well if you re if both of you

556.64 --> 560.8389999999999
are having trouble with this and you

558.24 --> 563.92
really think it is some kind of a

560.839 --> 566.32
emf influence from the outside have you

563.92 --> 568.16
ever considered

566.32 --> 569.6800000000001
well with your location everything it

568.16 --> 572.48
wouldn't

569.68 --> 574.4799999999999
be too crazy to try and insulate the

572.48 --> 577.6
room you're sleeping in

574.48 --> 579.6800000000001
like maybe

577.6 --> 582.48
i take it you have a separate bedroom

579.68 --> 585.8389999999999
from everything else

582.48 --> 588.9590000000001
or if you like uh

585.839 --> 592.24
insulate the room you might

588.959 --> 604.7199999999999
have less trouble of this emf influence

592.24 --> 606.9590000000001
when you go to sleep just a tip

604.72 --> 606.9590000000001
all right

613.44 --> 619.839
no it's a studio what

632.16 --> 636.48
only one room tough

644.399 --> 648.0
all right well if insulation is not

646.959 --> 651.5189999999999
really an option

648.0 --> 654.32
then maybe there might be a way

651.519 --> 655.12
with an emf detector there's people that

654.32 --> 658.0
have them

655.12 --> 658.88
for hire and everything figure out

658.0 --> 662.56
exactly

658.88 --> 663.68
what the source of the disruption is it

662.56 --> 666.8
might actually be

663.68 --> 668.3199999999999
your own phones at night

666.8 --> 670.4799999999999
that are doing that it's coming through

668.32 --> 672.839
there they could be and hearing more

670.48 --> 675.44
about that

672.839 --> 677.7600000000001
right

675.44 --> 679.7600000000001
it's good to know if they're like if

677.76 --> 682.16
there is a disruptive influence like

679.76 --> 684.24
where is it coming from

682.16 --> 685.8389999999999
because very likely if you're in the

684.24 --> 688.16
room with your phones

685.839 --> 691.0400000000001
that it is going to be the source of

688.16 --> 691.04
that influence

695.44 --> 703.839
you might want to isolate the the cause

699.279 --> 703.8389999999999
the variable find the variable

704.0 --> 706.24
all right

711.92 --> 717.8389999999999
hey neil gossentino george sanford here

714.56 --> 717.8389999999999
we go again

726.32 --> 731.839
smart tvs i don't think rasta hat has a

729.12 --> 731.839
tv

750.399 --> 756.16
all right neither do i it's been a long

752.639 --> 756.16
time since i had a tv

757.44 --> 764.0
uh i used to have one

760.48 --> 767.839
from like 2006 but it it turned in

764.0 --> 771.12
like the the lighting completely broke

767.839 --> 773.839
so it just gave a white screen

771.12 --> 773.839
huh

774.48 --> 781.2
hey terminoid new moon at the moment

778.079 --> 782.2399999999999
possible cause sure terminoid it did

781.2 --> 784.48
feel like

782.24 --> 787.279
as i said like even in the night it felt

784.48 --> 788.639
like oh like this one is going to be a

787.279 --> 790.16
big dream

788.639 --> 792.9590000000001
it's going to be a big dream night for

790.16 --> 792.959
me and it was

793.519 --> 800.16
i felt it coming and yeah full-on

796.8 --> 802.16
4th dimensional dream

800.16 --> 805.04
but for me it was mostly hanging out

802.16 --> 805.04
with my family

807.92 --> 810.4799999999999
my yeah

811.04 --> 815.4399999999999
not with the actual people left in the

814.32 --> 819.0400000000001
real world but

815.44 --> 821.6800000000001
like with i guess shadows my situation

819.04 --> 821.68
from old

822.639 --> 829.839
the old family setup

834.399 --> 838.24
all right what uh yeah stop trafficking

836.88 --> 841.199
my rasta had

838.24 --> 842.0790000000001
a basic tip if you don't want to go

841.199 --> 846.959
insulating

842.079 --> 849.3599999999999
paint or aluminium foil

846.959 --> 851.3599999999999
covering of the room if you don't you

849.36 --> 852.399
might want to try just like a blocked

851.36 --> 854.72
pocket

852.399 --> 856.32
like the ones that infowars sell or you

854.72 --> 858.8000000000001
probably got

856.32 --> 859.6
that type of pocket that you can find

858.8 --> 862.16
somewhere else

859.6 --> 864.32
since you're a rasta hat but that might

862.16 --> 865.36
be a basic solution if you put it in

864.32 --> 867.36
there

865.36 --> 869.76
you can still use its alarm clock but

867.36 --> 871.519
there will be no emf coming through it

869.76 --> 876.399
while it's in there and you won't be

871.519 --> 882.48
able to receive a call either by the way

876.399 --> 882.48
right if you want to keep it simple

883.44 --> 885.839
uh

904.0 --> 910.32
right yeah so also yeah

907.279 --> 912.399
oh benjamin of course his old youtube

910.32 --> 913.6
had been deleted again gary and terry

912.399 --> 917.839
but he is setting up

913.6 --> 919.9200000000001
something new and i finally found

917.839 --> 922.0790000000001
the youtube account for that although

919.92 --> 924.8389999999999
there's no streams on it just yet

922.079 --> 926.399
seems like it was laid out to be

924.839 --> 929.1990000000001
prepared

926.399 --> 930.48
tea time with barry and larry is the new

929.199 --> 933.5999999999999
one

930.48 --> 937.12
so yeah we'll see if uh

933.6 --> 940.399
own benjamin is gonna appear on those

937.12 --> 943.519
just watching a little bit of his

940.399 --> 945.44
i had two streams yesterday

943.519 --> 946.72
but just watched 10 minutes of one of

945.44 --> 950.48
them

946.72 --> 952.1600000000001
so it didn't really get to it yet

950.48 --> 955.04
all right been watching like all kinds

952.16 --> 958.48
of movies yesterday finished

955.04 --> 958.48
the star wars sequels

958.639 --> 962.5600000000001
and actually the the last one

965.92 --> 972.639
it wasn't that bad

969.44 --> 974.8000000000001
i i wonder i'm trying to remember what i

972.639 --> 979.199
said the first time you saw it

974.8 --> 982.24
it's just that again they did like the

979.199 --> 986.639
forced thing

982.24 --> 986.639
not like as in the force but like this

987.279 --> 994.8
forced contras controversy this weird

990.639 --> 997.44
setup of the movie of how things unfold

994.8 --> 998.88
they did like they did that made it a

997.44 --> 1002.72
little weird

998.88 --> 1005.519
but if you overlook those

1002.72 --> 1006.0
movie decisions it was actually pretty

1005.519 --> 1009.92
good

1006.0 --> 1010.48
and very cool and again the special

1009.92 --> 1015.12
effects

1010.48 --> 1017.44
just the cgi was just absolutely amazing

1015.12 --> 1019.12
even though like the entire thing was

1017.44 --> 1021.759
kind of like oh my god really you're

1019.12 --> 1021.759
gonna go there

1021.92 --> 1028.0
it was still was still very

1025.28 --> 1028.0
entertaining

1031.439 --> 1036.24
i had more hassle watching the second

1034.959 --> 1038.24
one

1036.24 --> 1039.679
like there were like really annoying

1038.24 --> 1043.28
things in there

1039.679 --> 1046.16
this one the last one not

1043.28 --> 1047.52
annoying super annoying just like oh

1046.16 --> 1049.6000000000001
really you're gonna go there

1047.52 --> 1051.12
that type of thing right anyway star

1049.6 --> 1055.1999999999998
wars sequels

1051.12 --> 1057.1999999999998
oh watch the paddington bear movie

1055.2 --> 1059.44
never seen that before there was the

1057.2 --> 1063.2
second one i think

1059.44 --> 1066.64
it's not my thing that bear

1063.2 --> 1068.96
annoys the [ __ ] out of me this is

1066.64 --> 1070.4
but i guess there's gonna yeah it's a

1068.96 --> 1073.2
cultural icon

1070.4 --> 1073.2
very british

1074.799 --> 1078.6399999999999
i bet it's gonna be wildly entertaining

1077.2 --> 1082.24
to little kids

1078.64 --> 1082.24
it was really directed to that

1087.44 --> 1093.3600000000001
a decent movie uh

1090.72 --> 1095.679
oh yeah for some reason i watched

1093.36 --> 1098.3999999999999
indiana jones

1095.679 --> 1100.0
too it was just like i just didn't want

1098.4 --> 1109.8400000000001
to go to sleep and just

1100.0 --> 1109.84
started watching one movie after another

1113.84 --> 1117.12
right uh

1119.6 --> 1124.9599999999998
before i started watching movies there

1122.32 --> 1127.4399999999998
was also like randy came on to

1124.96 --> 1129.2
what is it planar walk channel i don't

1127.44 --> 1132.16
know that guy

1129.2 --> 1133.679
he came on there and i was just kind of

1132.16 --> 1136.0800000000002
like

1133.679 --> 1137.2
going in the chat there and oh my god

1136.08 --> 1139.76
it's like

1137.2 --> 1141.8400000000001
so many nasty ballers and they were

1139.76 --> 1143.44
really getting obsessed over my presence

1141.84 --> 1145.52
there

1143.44 --> 1148.4
in the chat i didn't even like really

1145.52 --> 1151.28
listen to what randy was talking about

1148.4 --> 1152.48
i was just getting in there and trolling

1151.28 --> 1155.6789999999999
a bit

1152.48 --> 1158.799
it like as if i would be

1155.679 --> 1160.0
over at jose's or something except yeah

1158.799 --> 1162.08
there was no

1160.0 --> 1163.2
sean hawkins there so i didn't get

1162.08 --> 1165.76
blocked

1163.2 --> 1168.0
in the chat and it wasn't being nasty

1165.76 --> 1168.0
right

1172.4 --> 1176.799
but yeah ranty seems to be going around

1174.72 --> 1180.32
and telling people that

1176.799 --> 1181.44
nathan oakley and the panel and kiwi

1180.32 --> 1184.6399999999999
that we're a cult

1181.44 --> 1184.64
we're a cult now guys

1185.36 --> 1190.7199999999998
and ranty is going in the rounds telling

1188.72 --> 1193.28
everybody how he was able to

1190.72 --> 1195.6000000000001
get out of the cult seriously that's his

1193.28 --> 1200.0
thing now

1195.6 --> 1200.0
he's gone to that level isn't that just

1204.84 --> 1207.84
special

1210.24 --> 1213.44
cult means culture

1218.0 --> 1221.84
no not in that context

1227.44 --> 1230.64
but it was extremely contradicting

1229.36 --> 1233.76
anyway because

1230.64 --> 1235.919
a cult the technical setup for a cult is

1233.76 --> 1238.48
always centralized always with a

1235.919 --> 1238.48
hierarchy

1239.12 --> 1242.7199999999998
and then randy started to proceed to

1242.0 --> 1246.24
explain

1242.72 --> 1249.6000000000001
like yeah it's a cult of individuals

1246.24 --> 1252.48
uh that's not what a cult is like

1249.6 --> 1254.6399999999999
in a cult that that doesn't happen

1252.48 --> 1256.0
people actually come there to relinquish

1254.64 --> 1259.039
their individuality

1256.0 --> 1262.32
and give power

1259.039 --> 1265.84
to the hierarchy to the cult so that was

1262.32 --> 1267.9189999999999
already kind of self-contradicting

1265.84 --> 1270.0
that's like the one moment that i

1267.919 --> 1270.88
actually listened to what randy was

1270.0 --> 1273.84
saying in

1270.88 --> 1275.0390000000002
in that hangout the rest i kind of muted

1273.84 --> 1278.1589999999999
it and just

1275.039 --> 1281.36
stayed and come and fooling around

1278.159 --> 1281.3600000000001
but that was kind of funny

1284.96 --> 1291.8400000000001
flat earth has been the culture no

1298.24 --> 1304.799
now this flat earth on the internet

1300.96 --> 1307.3600000000001
that's a new culture that didn't exist

1304.799 --> 1307.36
before

1309.76 --> 1313.919
right there were all kinds of cultures

1312.559 --> 1318.08
out here that would

1313.919 --> 1320.7990000000002
hold on to earth flatness or no globe

1318.08 --> 1322.48
perhaps but it was never centralized

1320.799 --> 1326.08
around it

1322.48 --> 1333.84
so this culture is new it is new

1326.08 --> 1333.84
wasn't like this before

1339.2 --> 1347.8400000000001
right tiny bumble you you saw it too

1355.28 --> 1358.48
right turret yeah yeah no yeah that is

1357.84 --> 1361.9189999999999
true

1358.48 --> 1364.4
communism is communism reversed world

1361.919 --> 1364.4
thinking

1365.28 --> 1368.559
following the dream handed out to you

1367.84 --> 1371.6789999999999
top down

1368.559 --> 1371.6789999999999
yeah that is a cult

1372.72 --> 1376.96
now the globe part of it in my opinion

1375.28 --> 1379.9189999999999
isn't necessarily

1376.96 --> 1383.1200000000001
difficult right i think that the whole

1379.919 --> 1386.7990000000002
covet medical industrial situation

1383.12 --> 1386.799
that is much more the death cult

1387.44 --> 1402.159
globe called is just a lies how to stay

1391.039 --> 1404.8799999999999
in a dream forever

1402.159 --> 1417.8400000000001
daily tea yeah thanks for listening

1404.88 --> 1417.8400000000001
that's okay

1419.6 --> 1423.039
to baltart using common sense is like

1422.48 --> 1426.559
being

1423.039 --> 1426.559
part of a cult well

1426.799 --> 1431.279
of course ballers are part of the

1429.12 --> 1434.6399999999999
reversed world

1431.279 --> 1437.279
system probably unwittingly

1434.64 --> 1438.7990000000002
like most groups that are part of the

1437.279 --> 1441.679
reversed world

1438.799 --> 1442.6399999999999
culture and yeah it's no surprise

1441.679 --> 1445.279
they're gonna see

1442.64 --> 1446.3200000000002
anybody that applies common sense as

1445.279 --> 1449.36
being the cult

1446.32 --> 1451.2
because that's how it feels like to them

1449.36 --> 1453.6
it's like somebody that steps away from

1451.2 --> 1457.039
the bigger picture

1453.6 --> 1457.52
and then like throws that all out of the

1457.039 --> 1460.08
door

1457.52 --> 1462.4
to do something else that seems like a

1460.08 --> 1462.3999999999999
cult

1462.72 --> 1466.64
they don't understand that it's them

1464.72 --> 1470.159
actually in the cult

1466.64 --> 1470.159
it's just a very big one

1470.48 --> 1475.52
and that there's things that they're not

1472.4 --> 1477.679
grasping although they should know that

1475.52 --> 1479.76
because they're it's part of what they

1477.679 --> 1482.159
do avoiding

1479.76 --> 1483.679
letting certain things sink in

1482.159 --> 1485.919
discarding things before

1483.679 --> 1488.799
thinking about it that is the actual

1485.919 --> 1488.7990000000002
cult behavior

1492.88 --> 1496.7990000000002
they taught flat earth in schools

1497.6 --> 1502.1589999999999
really do you have any proof of that

1500.88 --> 1505.279
george sanford

1502.159 --> 1505.919
i mean i'm pretty sure they didn't

1505.279 --> 1509.039
always

1505.919 --> 1511.6000000000001
teach the ball earth in school

1509.039 --> 1512.84
but like really teach the flat earth in

1511.6 --> 1516.08
school

1512.84 --> 1519.279
no and there was never any

1516.08 --> 1520.48
true model that was being used in that

1519.279 --> 1522.4
teaching and that's probably

1520.48 --> 1524.559
why they didn't because the earth is not

1522.4 --> 1527.2
just a disc and that's it

1524.559 --> 1528.08
right it's not that easy especially to

1527.2 --> 1531.2
young kids

1528.08 --> 1533.12
to teach them about like cosmogeny

1531.2 --> 1534.88
because marginally is complicated you're

1533.12 --> 1538.08
not going to have that

1534.88 --> 1538.0800000000002
in standard school

1538.88 --> 1543.8400000000001
in young kids school

1550.159 --> 1553.44
dave weiss video i heard it many times

1552.08 --> 1555.36
yeah but that's different

1553.44 --> 1557.8400000000001
that's different george sanford because

1555.36 --> 1562.24
that's in bible class

1557.84 --> 1564.799
then you get through bible class

1562.24 --> 1567.2
the parts where it's basically discussed

1564.799 --> 1569.84
like yeah see it's flat because of this

1567.2 --> 1571.3600000000001
descriptive detail and all that right

1569.84 --> 1573.52
that's the way

1571.36 --> 1575.84
that's the way flat earth was taught in

1573.52 --> 1577.76
school and then you ask about it

1575.84 --> 1579.12
and then yeah you can get the teacher

1577.76 --> 1582.1589999999999
can elaborate

1579.12 --> 1584.559
it's not just like oh let's talk about

1582.159 --> 1585.8400000000001
the shape of the earth today let's talk

1584.559 --> 1588.48
about geology

1585.84 --> 1590.1589999999999
non-globe geology that's not what

1588.48 --> 1592.559
happened in school

1590.159 --> 1594.3200000000002
okay that's not how that went i'm pretty

1592.559 --> 1596.8799999999999
sure that every time there was

1594.32 --> 1598.6399999999999
the shape of the earth was addressed in

1596.88 --> 1602.64
school in the old days it was

1598.64 --> 1602.64
through bible school

1605.039 --> 1610.84
hey and if i'm wrong with this i'd like

1607.44 --> 1613.8400000000001
to see some evidence of it

1610.84 --> 1613.84
okay

1627.919 --> 1631.679
i have no idea what you're talking about

1638.96 --> 1641.8400000000001
never heard of that

1642.399 --> 1655.84
religious fundy uh

1645.44 --> 1655.8400000000001
what kind of religious fundy

1670.559 --> 1675.84
so i'm trying to flatter doctrine okay

1680.84 --> 1686.399
so

1682.08 --> 1686.399
it's what are you blabbering about

1693.84 --> 1699.4399999999998
so basically what you're saying this

1696.0 --> 1701.919
john alexander dowie guy

1699.44 --> 1704.3990000000001
put a little extra emphasis on the shape

1701.919 --> 1707.919
of the earth within his

1704.399 --> 1712.0
biblical teachings

1707.919 --> 1714.159
right so again through bible school

1712.0 --> 1716.48
you're basically confirming what i'm

1714.159 --> 1716.48
saying

1720.88 --> 1724.3990000000001
right well it's not going to be just

1723.2 --> 1729.279
this

1724.399 --> 1729.279
illinois place that did that

1729.679 --> 1736.64
okay it's just that hey back in the days

1733.6 --> 1737.4399999999998
100 years ago or more there was bible

1736.64 --> 1741.2
study

1737.44 --> 1741.2
like in probably every school

1743.44 --> 1748.0
and that's where you could find it right

1745.2 --> 1752.0
now this character might have

1748.0 --> 1755.6
put extra effort extra attention

1752.0 --> 1767.84
in his curriculum for the flat earth

1755.6 --> 1767.84
it's still just bible study

1778.84 --> 1781.84
um

1810.88 --> 1823.8400000000001
hello tev man

1835.84 --> 1842.399
falling from the wow

1839.12 --> 1845.76
that's kind of lame

1842.399 --> 1851.84
so he particularly

1845.76 --> 1851.84
he so he added [ __ ] onto it then

1852.72 --> 1856.88
he actually did the reification of a

1855.279 --> 1860.88
disc with an edge

1856.88 --> 1864.5590000000002
that's that sounds like a plant

1860.88 --> 1867.6000000000001
that sounds like freemasonry

1864.559 --> 1870.6399999999999
so that's not good

1867.6 --> 1873.12
then he didn't properly

1870.64 --> 1873.679
teach flat earth through biblical he

1873.12 --> 1877.12
actually

1873.679 --> 1881.2
introduced the disc model in a way

1877.12 --> 1883.76
that's project that's a project

1881.2 --> 1885.519
that's a the flat earth model that we

1883.76 --> 1887.919
have been handed

1885.519 --> 1888.72
at the beginning of the flat earth

1887.919 --> 1891.679
awakening

1888.72 --> 1895.519
that model the disc the reification of a

1891.679 --> 1895.519
literal dome disc with an edge

1896.24 --> 1899.679
so this guy was part of that you're

1898.559 --> 1907.84
saying he was part of

1899.679 --> 1907.8400000000001
introducing that into school

1947.679 --> 1953.8400000000001
introduced it in this one isolated city

1951.519 --> 1953.84
all right

1957.279 --> 1961.6
all right i can imagine that there would

1959.519 --> 1962.32
be a lot of objection from a lot of

1961.6 --> 1966.1589999999999
sides

1962.32 --> 1966.1589999999999
to it because

1966.64 --> 1970.3200000000002
exactly where in the bible is there a

1969.36 --> 1976.0
reference to an

1970.32 --> 1978.24
edge you can fall off of the disk

1976.0 --> 1978.24
right

1979.039 --> 1982.32
where in the bible does it actually say

1981.12 --> 1985.76
the earth is

1982.32 --> 1985.76
literally a disc

1985.919 --> 1992.24
with an edge and

1988.96 --> 1992.64
and a dome it doesn't say that it kind

1992.24 --> 1995.76
of

1992.64 --> 1997.3600000000001
leaves that open it says there's a

1995.76 --> 1999.919
circle of the earth

1997.36 --> 2001.279
there's a firmament no confirmation that

1999.919 --> 2003.519
means dome

2001.279 --> 2004.399
and there's definitely not an edge to

2003.519 --> 2006.88
fall over

2004.399 --> 2007.76
right right there are descriptions of

2006.88 --> 2011.1200000000001
the abyss

2007.76 --> 2015.279
but that's not like earthly edge

2011.12 --> 2018.7199999999998
situation so that means that this guy

2015.279 --> 2020.64
started reifying elements of that

2018.72 --> 2022.96
into a literal model and then started

2020.64 --> 2026.7990000000002
teaching that right that's

2022.96 --> 2029.2
the origin of the disc model

2026.799 --> 2031.44
that's reification so he would have not

2029.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
been welcomed by a lot of people to do

2031.44 --> 2037.919
that

2033.84 --> 2037.9189999999999
so not surprising he kept it to his one

2044.84 --> 2047.84
city

2058.839 --> 2061.839
uh

2092.399 --> 2097.52
yeah tear it dude just don't take it

2098.0 --> 2101.52
there's no limit on who they're gonna

2100.16 --> 2104.24
try to force it on

2101.52 --> 2105.119
the most outrageous situations right

2104.24 --> 2106.9599999999996
they're just

2105.119 --> 2109.119
every it's just going to be everyone

2106.96 --> 2112.32
everyone

2109.119 --> 2116.0
point is to reject it

2112.32 --> 2118.96
that's the only point like no matter

2116.0 --> 2119.52
what they say it's all technically a

2118.96 --> 2124.4
bluff

2119.52 --> 2124.4
a bluff with with some weight some peer

2128.839 --> 2131.839
pressure

2136.72 --> 2144.0
so don't worry about it right don't

2140.8 --> 2146.48
don't make the nightmare your

2144.0 --> 2147.04
nightmare don't start dwelling on that

2146.48 --> 2149.68
[ __ ]

2147.04 --> 2151.839
all the time because then the darkness

2149.68 --> 2154.48
becomes you if you dwell too much onto

2151.839 --> 2154.48
the darkness

2155.76 --> 2161.76
like keep your attention to it like

2159.119 --> 2162.56
dwell specifically on it constantly

2161.76 --> 2164.8
without

2162.56 --> 2165.599
actually just recognizing the solution

2164.8 --> 2170.2400000000002
and then

2165.599 --> 2172.56
envisioning something away from it

2170.24 --> 2174.8799999999997
then eventually the darkness just starts

2172.56 --> 2178.4
to consume you from the inside out

2174.88 --> 2179.76
it happens to everything with everything

2178.4 --> 2182.56
and everyone

2179.76 --> 2182.5600000000004
just don't do it

2183.359 --> 2189.2
right so what is it gonna do for you

2187.04 --> 2190.96
to go around all day long constantly

2189.2 --> 2192.56
saying oh it's death called death god oh

2190.96 --> 2194.8
they're killing everyone oh it's worse

2192.56 --> 2194.7999999999997
oh

2197.92 --> 2204.16
just don't take it don't be part of it

2201.04 --> 2206.8
think about the solutions rather than

2204.16 --> 2206.7999999999997
the damage

2211.44 --> 2215.839
note tev man sounds ridiculous

2244.74 --> 2247.87
[Music]

2254.839 --> 2257.839
um

2268.839 --> 2271.839
uh

2296.839 --> 2299.839
huh

2321.04 --> 2324.16
little rocket blimps

2325.68 --> 2341.839
cleary good to see you

2362.32 --> 2367.599
right so yeah i got another 15 minutes

2365.119 --> 2370.56
roughly

2367.599 --> 2370.56
anything else

2373.839 --> 2383.839
anybody wants me to address

2390.16 --> 2396.8799999999997
you got your name from from

2393.52 --> 2400.88
me once talking about rocket zeppelins

2396.88 --> 2400.88
you mean rocket blimps right well yeah

2400.96 --> 2405.04
from me all right well i wasn't the

2403.44 --> 2407.28
first one that actually talked about

2405.04 --> 2407.2799999999997
that

2408.16 --> 2412.96
but it is like the weirdly enough it is

2410.48 --> 2417.76
like one of the dark world memories

2412.96 --> 2422.2400000000002
from way back that really

2417.76 --> 2422.2400000000002
hung with me the longest like it

2423.04 --> 2428.88
like from 97 it was revealed to me in

2426.88 --> 2430.319
the dark world like yeah space shuttles

2428.88 --> 2432.0
are

2430.319 --> 2433.359
or the like the rockets they're on are

2432.0 --> 2437.599
basically

2433.359 --> 2439.5989999999997
blimps they're like

2437.599 --> 2441.599
not filled with rocket fuel they're

2439.599 --> 2445.28
actually filled with most

2441.599 --> 2452.0
mostly just density

2445.28 --> 2454.4
lowering gas

2452.0 --> 2455.839
and i even back then thought it was very

2454.4 --> 2458.7200000000003
weird and kind of like

2455.839 --> 2458.72
forgot about it

2462.24 --> 2467.839
but i just remember remembering that

2486.4 --> 2495.839
hey james mason good to see you

2500.72 --> 2509.839
they're made of kevlar what

2520.839 --> 2523.839
okay

2526.24 --> 2531.839
it seems a bit strange to make it of

2528.88 --> 2531.839
that material but

2534.839 --> 2537.839
sure

2562.839 --> 2565.839
hmm

2584.88 --> 2588.319
yeah he's taking star wars

2589.599 --> 2594.56
yeah i'm doing okay i started the show

2592.24 --> 2597.5989999999997
incredibly late though today

2594.56 --> 2599.92
because yeah i overslept and i was just

2597.599 --> 2601.76
heavily dreaming

2599.92 --> 2603.119
like i'm finally starting to wake up

2601.76 --> 2605.76
because it was really just

2603.119 --> 2606.1600000000003
i woke up when i was in the middle of a

2605.76 --> 2609.3590000000004
dream

2606.16 --> 2610.7999999999997
of still and then in my dream

2609.359 --> 2612.4
like i was reminding hey you have to

2610.8 --> 2613.76
start the show you're already late and

2612.4 --> 2616.56
like what

2613.76 --> 2616.5600000000004
then i wake up

2618.839 --> 2621.839
um

2623.28 --> 2627.2000000000003
lots of heavy dreaming last night

2627.92 --> 2632.8
but in a good way like very reassuring

2633.68 --> 2636.8799999999997
like i think i'm not sure but i think

2636.56 --> 2639.04
that

2636.88 --> 2641.44
it might have been like a sign like i am

2639.04 --> 2642.96
going to overcome my rage

2641.44 --> 2645.44
and that's kind of something that i've

2642.96 --> 2648.0
been well

2645.44 --> 2648.96
wishing for i guess like an intention

2648.0 --> 2650.48
wish that i

2648.96 --> 2652.56
keep in the background like yeah it's

2650.48 --> 2654.48
important to do that

2652.56 --> 2657.599
and i've been making a lot of effort at

2654.48 --> 2660.2400000000002
it if i say so myself

2657.599 --> 2662.079
to really get it under control and it

2660.24 --> 2666.319
was kind of like a

2662.079 --> 2666.319
promise or a fulfillment almost

2667.119 --> 2672.7200000000003
and i i feel like the way

2673.76 --> 2677.599
my spirit body is composed has altered

2676.4 --> 2681.28
somewhat

2677.599 --> 2681.28
because of what happened this night

2682.8 --> 2686.7200000000003
and i hope it stays i'm gonna double

2684.96 --> 2705.839
check with my healer

2686.72 --> 2705.839
somewhere later gonna call about that

2707.68 --> 2711.2799999999997
you got busy drawing all right

2715.839 --> 2720.24
i'm not gonna make a habit of starting

2717.76 --> 2722.0
up more than an hour late don't worry

2720.24 --> 2725.2
about that

2722.0 --> 2725.2
it was an incident

2772.839 --> 2775.839
hmm

2781.04 --> 2785.2
right now i'm not gonna skip any show if

2783.839 --> 2787.2799999999997
i can help it

2785.2 --> 2789.68
right even if it's just very short

2787.28 --> 2793.44
unless it's like i only have like a half

2789.68 --> 2793.44
hour left then i'm probably not gonna do

2799.2 --> 2803.2
[Music]

2800.839 --> 2817.839
it

2803.2 --> 2817.839
hey hello unicorn laser eyes

2830.0 --> 2832.319
right

2841.44 --> 2845.839
about war is fake

2846.72 --> 2849.1189999999997
maybe

2856.48 --> 2860.8
well maybe it's it's tough it's

2858.4 --> 2863.2000000000003
difficult it's like there might be

2860.8 --> 2864.6400000000003
multiple sides to a war there is like

2863.2 --> 2867.839
the

2864.64 --> 2869.92
the media version of it

2867.839 --> 2871.68
and then there's the actual ground

2869.92 --> 2873.2000000000003
activities version of it

2871.68 --> 2875.839
right doesn't mean that war is

2873.2 --> 2879.04
completely fake

2875.839 --> 2880.88
there is stuff happening but yeah

2879.04 --> 2883.44
controlled demolition and strategic

2880.88 --> 2886.48
location might not be

2883.44 --> 2886.8
like a lot of these actions might simply

2886.48 --> 2890.079
be

2886.8 --> 2893.119
agreed upon like

2890.079 --> 2896.96
instead of like trying to outwit

2893.119 --> 2899.04
each other it's like more like the

2896.96 --> 2900.64
the feudal days between kings where they

2899.04 --> 2902.96
would basically decide this

2900.64 --> 2904.64
is the battle we're going to have these

2902.96 --> 2908.48
are the rules

2904.64 --> 2912.24
like playing chess so

2908.48 --> 2916.079
that might be a thing that has become

2912.24 --> 2921.359
re rein like that system

2916.079 --> 2921.3590000000004
for war you'll find out when it happens

2921.92 --> 2925.839
if that is the case because doing it

2924.64 --> 2928.8799999999997
like that

2925.839 --> 2931.92
does resolve like tensions

2928.88 --> 2935.04
if issues without like both

2931.92 --> 2936.4
sides completely obsessing and going way

2935.04 --> 2938.64
too far

2936.4 --> 2940.7200000000003
in undermining each other and then

2938.64 --> 2943.92
ruining

2940.72 --> 2946.48
occult agreed upon plans

2943.92 --> 2947.44
programming it will ruin the programming

2946.48 --> 2950.64
so doing it

2947.44 --> 2954.319
controlled like an agreement

2950.64 --> 2957.7599999999998
like a game unrolling is

2954.319 --> 2960.319
less damaging to the control itself

2957.76 --> 2961.28
so in that sense yeah war might

2960.319 --> 2965.119
definitely be

2961.28 --> 2968.8390000000004
fake it doesn't mean it's a complete

2965.119 --> 2971.599
illusion there will still be things

2968.839 --> 2974.96
happening

2971.599 --> 2976.96
it's just that it's painted over

2974.96 --> 2979.599
as a more romanticized more

2976.96 --> 2983.119
straightforward believable form of war

2979.599 --> 2983.119
that people can resonate with

2983.359 --> 2987.839
and get caught up with and all that

2996.839 --> 2999.839
right

3024.559 --> 3028.88
right so yeah i am kind of gonna round

3027.76 --> 3032.4
out the show

3028.88 --> 3033.44
sorry that it's so short but i do wanted

3032.4 --> 3037.76
to emphasize

3033.44 --> 3041.839
for a moment again like i i need

3037.76 --> 3044.96
some support my bills are

3041.839 --> 3044.96
kind of growing

3048.48 --> 3050.96
and

3052.96 --> 3060.48
yeah there have been people

3056.24 --> 3060.4799999999996
in the past supporting me a great deal

3060.72 --> 3065.2799999999997
i've got some new supporters that

3063.76 --> 3069.44
give me a little bits here and there and

3065.28 --> 3072.2400000000002
that's very welcome very nice

3069.44 --> 3074.319
but i could you really use some a

3072.24 --> 3075.7599999999998
serious boost basically it yeah it's

3074.319 --> 3079.119
kind of weird asking for it

3075.76 --> 3082.1600000000003
right but i really need it

3079.119 --> 3085.76
i need extra support

3082.16 --> 3090.72
i need probably more than i'm gonna get

3085.76 --> 3092.96
but i just need to have it set i need it

3090.72 --> 3095.04
because there's bills and with the way

3092.96 --> 3096.7200000000003
things are going

3095.04 --> 3098.88
like i don't even think that with the

3096.72 --> 3102.48
vacation money i'm gonna be getting

3098.88 --> 3104.6400000000003
early june i'm going to be able to pay

3102.48 --> 3108.0
off all the debts at this point

3104.64 --> 3111.68
that's very problematic so

3108.0 --> 3114.88
if i could get somehow

3111.68 --> 3116.8799999999997
get extra support from people that have

3114.88 --> 3118.7200000000003
yeah i've done that in the past too i

3116.88 --> 3123.04
hope i'm still worth it

3118.72 --> 3123.04
i know i don't constantly talk about

3123.839 --> 3127.119
like mechanical subjects all the time

3126.64 --> 3129.839
right

3127.119 --> 3132.8
i i know i should probably be even more

3129.839 --> 3132.7999999999997
focused to do it

3136.16 --> 3143.1189999999997
just saying it would solve a whole lot

3139.359 --> 3145.52
of yeah stress and it's not even

3143.119 --> 3146.96
because at the same time i'm also have

3145.52 --> 3149.52
worked a lot on

3146.96 --> 3151.2
not being so stressed about finances

3149.52 --> 3153.839
right because that's been a long-term

3151.2 --> 3153.839
issue with me

3155.04 --> 3161.839
so i'm holding it off or in the past i

3158.72 --> 3165.1189999999997
would get a lot more almost panicky

3161.839 --> 3168.0
on air and i'm trying to prevent that

3165.119 --> 3169.76
but at the same time i would like to

3168.0 --> 3172.64
like really emphasize i do

3169.76 --> 3176.0
need the support the paypal support oh

3172.64 --> 3176.0
by the way i still forgot

3177.28 --> 3184.8
the crypto links i should i should

3180.96 --> 3188.0
take them down because those wallets are

3184.8 --> 3188.0
not going to be functional

3191.68 --> 3195.1189999999997
if you guys can help me out with the

3193.44 --> 3197.76
paypal that would help

3195.119 --> 3197.76
so much

3198.4 --> 3200.7200000000003
and

3203.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
yeah so please consider

3220.839 --> 3223.839
so

3230.64 --> 3237.839
hmm what the hell rocket blimps

3239.28 --> 3242.8
like is there some war that has just

3241.2 --> 3251.839
broken out or something that i don't

3242.8 --> 3251.8390000000004
know about

3259.68 --> 3265.839
i don't see anything out there just

3263.52 --> 3265.839
hassle

3283.92 --> 3295.52
okay rocket lamps

3292.0 --> 3297.599
well the mechanics of bombing let's not

3295.52 --> 3300.0
talk about that in the last minute of

3297.599 --> 3300.0
the show

3302.559 --> 3309.599
it's his own aerial engineering

3307.119 --> 3310.88
right but anyway rounding out thanks
