99.68 --> 103.43900000000001
is

100.799 --> 103.43900000000001
beautiful

103.759 --> 108.24
though there have been lots of trails up

106.64 --> 109.6
there

108.24 --> 112.399
leaving this

109.6 --> 115.83999999999999
haze soup

112.399 --> 118.07900000000001
but yeah despite that there's still

115.84 --> 121.92
blue sky visible in between there and

118.079 --> 121.91999999999999
the sun is shining through just fine

123.2 --> 128.959
it's really nice

125.68 --> 132.31900000000002
the wind is kind of cool

128.959 --> 135.44
so it's just really pleasant outside

132.319 --> 139.35999999999999
must be great weather

135.44 --> 139.35999999999999
like going to the park or whatever

139.44 --> 144.239
getting out there enjoying

141.76 --> 144.239
nature

155.76 --> 161.12
hello mike's

157.36 --> 167.4
first in chat good to see you

161.12 --> 167.4
it is thursday the 28th of july 2022

169.2 --> 174.23899999999998
and

170.4 --> 174.239
yeah i'm gonna have a full show today

178.0 --> 182.159
and hopefully get some support because

180.319 --> 184.159
i've already decided if i don't get

182.159 --> 186.56
support in the weekdays i don't do

184.159 --> 189.44
weekend streams

186.56 --> 191.28
it's gonna be that simple

189.44 --> 193.84
i'll just do something else with my time

191.28 --> 193.84
in the weekend

196.48 --> 202.319
because

198.959 --> 203.84
i need to get around financially

202.319 --> 205.599
and

203.84 --> 207.12
whatever's going on

205.599 --> 210.48
out there

207.12 --> 212.799
like the setup is faltering

210.48 --> 215.04
i thought it was going great going

212.799 --> 215.84
stable

215.04 --> 219.599
but

215.84 --> 219.599
yeah this is not tenable for me

224.319 --> 228.72
but hey i still got inspiration and i'm

227.2 --> 231.11999999999998
still gonna keep going while that

228.72 --> 231.12
happens

231.92 --> 237.599
so yeah i thought that this this week

234.879 --> 240.72
has pretty much been among like my best

237.599 --> 243.11999999999998
weeks so far when it comes to spirit

240.72 --> 245.28
mechanics and just detail

243.12 --> 246.4
pointing out

245.28 --> 248.48
things that

246.4 --> 250.31900000000002
don't even have names

248.48 --> 252.72
yet we

250.319 --> 257.43899999999996
a lot of people recognize

252.72 --> 257.439
those things when i describe them

265.6 --> 269.6
and i'd love to talk about it again

267.759 --> 272.40000000000003
today

269.6 --> 273.91900000000004
if people are up for that

272.4 --> 275.919
uh

273.919 --> 278.96
right so yeah yesterday's flat earth

275.919 --> 281.03999999999996
debate was great very long

278.96 --> 283.59999999999997
very very long show

281.04 --> 287.28000000000003
and this time akumu virus got in there

283.6 --> 287.28000000000003
very late though in the aftershow

288.16 --> 292.08000000000004
and yeah just

290.16 --> 296.32000000000005
kinda

292.08 --> 299.28
did his muddying the water routine

296.32 --> 302.8
i don't know it's getting a bit stale

299.28 --> 302.79999999999995
almost like what he does

303.2 --> 308.88
[Music]

306.24 --> 308.88
but oh well

309.28 --> 315.19899999999996
rest of the show everybody's just very

311.12 --> 317.759
focused and it is hilarious to

315.199 --> 318.639
just look at how the anti-flat earthers

317.759 --> 321.84000000000003
are

318.639 --> 325.08
degenerating in their argumentation

321.84 --> 325.08
out there

329.44 --> 334.71999999999997
and i think that yesterday i brought in

331.6 --> 335.91900000000004
my conception of

334.72 --> 338.40000000000003
how time

335.919 --> 340.79999999999995
space bending is gonna get involved in

338.4 --> 343.28
the entire globe cosmology maybe that's

340.8 --> 347.199
even a better title for today's show but

343.28 --> 348.88
yeah now it's this title so

347.199 --> 350.24
because i think that like the entire

348.88 --> 352.479
globe model

350.24 --> 355.28000000000003
is eventually gonna have no choice but

352.479 --> 357.919
to completely forcefully

355.28 --> 360.23999999999995
move into pseudo romanian four space

357.919 --> 362.479
every aspect of it

360.24 --> 363.6
so that in the euclidean space we will

362.479 --> 367.28
be in a

363.6 --> 369.199
stationary enclosed black

367.28 --> 370.96
orientated surface

369.199 --> 373.44
based earth

370.96 --> 376.15999999999997
but in pseudo-harmony in four space well

373.44 --> 377.919
there is a globe and there everything

376.16 --> 379.44
according to the heliocentric model

377.919 --> 381.52
should exist

379.44 --> 383.6
so that's what i predict

381.52 --> 386.0
it's going to happen

383.6 --> 388.24
uh fight the flat earth was kind of the

386.0 --> 390.479
first one to roll it in

388.24 --> 392.479
concerning terrestrial refraction which

390.479 --> 395.28
is really weird and out of place to do

392.479 --> 397.44
that but predictable

395.28 --> 399.28
and i guess that i am not the only one

397.44 --> 401.199
who has predicted this is nathan brought

399.28 --> 402.55999999999995
up somebody else

401.199 --> 406.40000000000003
out there

402.56 --> 409.84
who had predicted this also

406.4 --> 409.84
and we're going to see it all happen

414.96 --> 418.71999999999997
ah right you've watched the episode

416.8 --> 420.56
gadget inspector about gaslighting

418.72 --> 423.52000000000004
yourself

420.56 --> 424.8
yeah

423.52 --> 426.96
yeah right

424.8 --> 428.639
it is

426.96 --> 431.68
it's never good gaslighting yourself is

428.639 --> 434.319
never going to be like a literal

431.68 --> 436.16
situation because it is kind of a bit of

434.319 --> 437.68
a joke

436.16 --> 439.91900000000004
but the thing is because of the

437.68 --> 442.16
psychological flexibility

439.919 --> 444.56
of what's going on out there and with

442.16 --> 446.03000000000003
anti-pilates and hey with politicians

444.56 --> 447.68
arguably as well

446.03 --> 449.84
[Music]

447.68 --> 451.599
i thought that gaslighting yourself as a

449.84 --> 453.84
concept

451.599 --> 455.039
like really hits the nail on the head

453.84 --> 458.23999999999995
actually

455.039 --> 459.52
even though it is illogical

458.24 --> 461.199
like

459.52 --> 462.96
essentially

461.199 --> 464.879
but yeah the guys

462.96 --> 468.56
nathan

464.879 --> 472.40000000000003
it and others insisted that

468.56 --> 474.24
you have to have a separate recipient

472.4 --> 475.84
for the gaslighting you can't do it to

474.24 --> 478.56
yourself well

475.84 --> 481.919
i dispute that but there's no real use

478.56 --> 481.919
arguing it with the guys

484.96 --> 489.479
but yeah that was an interesting episode

495.039 --> 497.84
okay tara

505.759 --> 509.52000000000004
if 306. wanna

507.12 --> 509.52
again

509.919 --> 514.56
speak out about your activities

512.32 --> 517.8000000000001
concerning that in public but hey it's

514.56 --> 517.8
your life

518.86 --> 522.809
[Music]

527.12 --> 530.88
you never knew it came from a movie

532.16 --> 536.7199999999999
well i had a suspicion that it came from

534.88 --> 537.92
a movie too

536.72 --> 541.6800000000001
but

537.92 --> 543.04
i also thought it was kind of like

541.68 --> 545.279
i thought it was a little bit more

543.04 --> 546.959
historical than just a movie i thought

545.279 --> 548.88
that it might have been like a movie

546.959 --> 552.399
based on a real event

548.88 --> 554.959
allegedly something like that but if it

552.399 --> 559.279
turned out that it's just that movie

554.959 --> 559.279
fine you know the word spam

559.68 --> 565.76
is not historical it came from

563.279 --> 567.76
monty python a sketch in monty python

565.76 --> 569.76
that's it that's where the word spam

567.76 --> 570.88
came from

569.76 --> 572.88
that's it

570.88 --> 575.4399999999999
right so yeah it

572.88 --> 576.72
it's definitely possible

575.44 --> 578.8000000000001
like

576.72 --> 582.0
media productions have

578.8 --> 584.399
led to the complete invention

582.0 --> 585.92
grassroots invention of words that have

584.399 --> 588.399
been widely

585.92 --> 591.519
used so

588.399 --> 594.24
hello slow mo moon buggy

591.519 --> 594.24
low darts

597.12 --> 600.12
okay

616.8 --> 619.8389999999999
a dart

618.24 --> 622.16
you got a point

619.839 --> 625.48
are you just gonna blabber random [ __ ]

622.16 --> 625.48
in my chat

648.64 --> 653.36
also yeah any

650.64 --> 655.6
hey how about any feedback about any

653.36 --> 658.16
intellectual feedback about the things

655.6 --> 660.32
that i talked about yesterday

658.16 --> 662.959
did any of you watch that show i know

660.32 --> 665.519
some of you were present for that show

662.959 --> 667.279
so can you prove to me that you actually

665.519 --> 668.24
understood what the hell i was talking

667.279 --> 670.72
about

668.24 --> 675.44
or you're just hanging around somebody

670.72 --> 678.0790000000001
that's talking about complicated things

675.44 --> 678.0790000000001
and that's it

678.72 --> 682.88
did you actually

680.399 --> 686.0
watch it think about it contemplate

682.88 --> 688.56
maybe watch it back

686.0 --> 689.68
to kind of get a framework inside your

688.56 --> 692.16
head

689.68 --> 694.959
to start understanding what it actually

692.16 --> 699.16
is that i was talking about

694.959 --> 699.16
how about some feedback guys

704.24 --> 709.839
or how about any feedback from anybody

707.36 --> 709.839
out there

710.24 --> 714.48
i mean

711.92 --> 717.279
i see channels around

714.48 --> 720.72
and they get all sorts of feedback all

717.279 --> 722.72
kinds loads loads of feedback so some of

720.72 --> 725.12
it just stupid and general comments but

722.72 --> 726.24
some of it pretty intense

725.12 --> 729.68
i

726.24 --> 732.32
have only shitty comments and just like

729.68 --> 734.7199999999999
a rare once a week somebody that i

732.32 --> 736.5600000000001
actually know saying oh hi or oh i

734.72 --> 737.76
missed the show oh

736.56 --> 739.5999999999999
yes

737.76 --> 742.16
great

739.6 --> 746.24
great commentary i mean

742.16 --> 746.24
for a guy that does an everyday show

747.279 --> 752.8
for that long

748.639 --> 752.8
to have this little comments is just

753.2 --> 755.839
surreal

757.44 --> 762.399
but hey

759.44 --> 765.44
i mean what what can i do you know i can

762.399 --> 767.76
like not delete the shitty shitty ass

765.44 --> 771.2
troll comments the same people that have

767.76 --> 773.36
been doing that for like six years now i

771.2 --> 775.76
could just leave it there to

773.36 --> 778.399
have some filler in the comment section

775.76 --> 782.24
it's gonna be all negative though

778.399 --> 784.959
unless you guys really really want that

782.24 --> 788.5600000000001
to respond

784.959 --> 788.56
if that's what you want to do

791.92 --> 795.8389999999999
what was the subject about well why

793.92 --> 799.4399999999999
don't you actually watch the show if you

795.839 --> 801.36
hadn't watched the show is your problem

799.44 --> 804.24
yesterday's show was one of my best

801.36 --> 806.48
shows prep probably of all time

804.24 --> 809.2
when it came to spirit comes to spirit

806.48 --> 811.36
mechanics it was so good

809.2 --> 814.0790000000001
that trolls literally

811.36 --> 818.5600000000001
start harassing me just to try to get me

814.079 --> 818.56
off that frequency it was that good

821.519 --> 825.0
how's that

837.279 --> 843.16
the gaia hypothesis

840.16 --> 843.16
okay

845.839 --> 852.24
wow

848.079 --> 853.5999999999999
the gaia theory how impressive it's not

852.24 --> 856.6800000000001
stupid

853.6 --> 859.6800000000001
hippie dippy [ __ ] atheist

856.68 --> 862.959
infiltrated with globalist eugenics

859.68 --> 862.959
propaganda at all

866.079 --> 872.399
well maybe it wasn't but it's definitely

867.92 --> 872.399
been hijacked for that anyway

878.8 --> 883.3599999999999
yeah i get that bjc net but hey

882.079 --> 886.3199999999999
there's

883.36 --> 889.44
like hundreds of views

886.32 --> 892.9200000000001
and you guys in chat it's like

889.44 --> 892.9200000000001
20 people

904.079 --> 909.04
worked with nasa okay yeah so who gives

906.399 --> 909.04

946.639 --> 950.8
just caught the end yesterday so you

948.48 --> 954.16
just didn't watch the rest then

950.8 --> 956.0
that's it am i just like a radio channel

954.16 --> 958.079
you're just too in oh this is what he

956.0 --> 959.519
happens to be talking about the last 15

958.079 --> 963.519
minutes

959.519 --> 966.24
i mean let's not watch the rest back

963.519 --> 968.72
is that what you guys do you just

966.24 --> 971.199
i mean is that what i've become now

968.72 --> 972.8000000000001
i mean i don't even know why i then do

971.199 --> 974.56
an everyday show

972.8 --> 976.16
with all that effort in

974.56 --> 978.399
in in it

976.16 --> 983.399
if if people aren't actually just gonna

978.399 --> 983.399

1231.919 --> 1236.5590000000002
and what crosses a line

1234.48 --> 1239.1200000000001
of like

1236.559 --> 1242.72
code of conduct in here that's what it's

1239.12 --> 1244.799
about that's what makes me pissed off

1242.72 --> 1246.96
and what makes me let myself go when

1244.799 --> 1250.24
that happens sometimes it's not about

1246.96 --> 1251.4

do something with it give me [ __ ]

1259.12 --> 1262.12
feedback

1271.52 --> 1276.48
i mean i can't believe that you're you'd

1273.6 --> 1279.4399999999998
actually present

1276.48 --> 1281.1200000000001
a a response to me

1279.44 --> 1283.679
saying that

1281.12 --> 1286.08
implying that you're like afraid of what

1283.679 --> 1288.799
i'm feeling like what the [ __ ] is going

1286.08 --> 1288.799
on here guys

1289.12 --> 1293.28
don't tell me you've become that much of

1291.2 --> 1295.6000000000001
a wussy

1293.28 --> 1298.3999999999999
that you're afraid

1295.6 --> 1301.1999999999998
if what you're gonna say might rub me

1298.4 --> 1304.44
the wrong way are you really that scared

1301.2 --> 1304.44
of me

1312.159 --> 1317.1200000000001
for you to worry about well why don't

1314.159 --> 1319.5200000000002
you worry about my financial situation

1317.12 --> 1320.9599999999998
and get me some support

1319.52 --> 1325.12
that's

1320.96 --> 1325.1200000000001
what i really worry about

1325.44 --> 1330.0800000000002
yeah is that

1327.84 --> 1331.6
like the dynamics of this like i don't

1330.08 --> 1333.6789999999999
get it anymore

1331.6 --> 1337.6
i don't get you guys anymore and i

1333.679 --> 1337.6000000000001
wonder if you guys get me

1337.679 --> 1342.799
because i don't want a bunch of groupies

1340.48 --> 1345.52
that's just gonna say yes arwen and

1342.799 --> 1347.84
smile with whatever the [ __ ] i do that's

1345.52 --> 1351.28
not what i want

1347.84 --> 1353.36
i just want you guys to get it

1351.28 --> 1356.24
and if getting it

1353.36 --> 1359.28
requires you to test it risking

1356.24 --> 1362.24
potentially pissing me off then you just

1359.28 --> 1364.799
have to [ __ ] do it and stop being a

1362.24 --> 1364.799
wussy

1365.12 --> 1371.12
i'm loud i'm passionate i get pissed off

1368.64 --> 1374.72
and i sometimes do it

1371.12 --> 1375.84
frivolously stupid and then i apologize

1374.72 --> 1377.919
for it

1375.84 --> 1380.799
and that's my issue

1377.919 --> 1383.8400000000001
and you shouldn't be so freaking easily

1380.799 --> 1386.799
intimidated that's gay

1383.84 --> 1389.84
it's gay to be intimidated by that

1386.799 --> 1389.84
don't be

1401.6 --> 1406.6399999999999

that's literally terrible for my health

1627.12 --> 1631.12
with palpable consequences

1637.12 --> 1641.52
yeah i'm not talking to trolls i'm

1639.279 --> 1645.039
talking to people that are actually

1641.52 --> 1648.08
identified individuals that come here

1645.039 --> 1650.08
on to my show that even support me

1648.08 --> 1652.48
that talk in my chat

1650.08 --> 1655.039
that are relatable that's why i'm not

1652.48 --> 1655.919
talking about [ __ ] [ __ ] trolls out

1655.039 --> 1658.72
there

1655.919 --> 1661.1200000000001

1661.12 --> 1666.7199999999998
you can go [ __ ] kill yourself

1663.679 --> 1668.3990000000001
i don't care what you think

1666.72 --> 1672.559
yeah i care

1668.399 --> 1672.559
for the people that i've given wrenches

1672.88 --> 1675.679
and

1674.08 --> 1677.6
arguably some other people that i

1675.679 --> 1681.279
haven't given wrenches but that are

1677.6 --> 1681.279
still very much identified

1685.039 --> 1688.799
just stop being afraid

1692.24 --> 1698.159
why would you be afraid of me unless

1695.76 --> 1700.1589999999999
you're an infiltrate you're not secretly

1698.159 --> 1702.0800000000002
what you think or how you present

1700.159 --> 1704.64
yourself to be

1702.08 --> 1708.0
and you're on my list of people that i

1704.64 --> 1709.919
want to get rid of in this world

1708.0 --> 1713.76
yeah then i'd be afraid too if you're

1709.919 --> 1714.5590000000002
not actually who you say you are yeah

1713.76 --> 1715.76
well

1714.559 --> 1717.84
aren't you

1715.76 --> 1719.6
aren't you guys

1717.84 --> 1722.1589999999999
that come in my chat and get wrenches

1719.6 --> 1724.1589999999999
aren't you i think you are why the hell

1722.159 --> 1729.24
are you afraid why are you letting

1724.159 --> 1729.24
yourself be intimidated for no reason

1740.159 --> 1743.919
yeah almost been banned several times

1742.32 --> 1747.559
for just disagreeing with you yeah and

1743.919 --> 1747.5590000000002
you're still here

1752.08 --> 1755.1999999999998
aren't you steaming trail you're here

1753.919 --> 1757.679
right

1755.2 --> 1757.679
aren't you

1759.279 --> 1764.48
if you disagree about something just

1762.24 --> 1766.799
make a case

1764.48 --> 1771.32
tell me why

1766.799 --> 1771.32
i'm not gonna ban you for that

1784.64 --> 1790.0
yeah

1786.96 --> 1792.96
i mean look how many people have ranches

1790.0 --> 1794.64
in my show a lot a lot of people have

1792.96 --> 1797.8400000000001
wrenches

1794.64 --> 1797.8400000000001
they don't get bent

1798.48 --> 1803.6
unless something like really

1800.72 --> 1805.2
gets out of control

1803.6 --> 1806.84
you squirt

1805.2 --> 1809.3600000000001
you can't hold your

1806.84 --> 1811.84
tongue because you're agitated on a

1809.36 --> 1814.4799999999998
personal level and then you act out and

1811.84 --> 1816.6399999999999
you act like a savage and then i'll take

1814.48 --> 1818.96
your ranch and ban you it's probably

1816.64 --> 1822.96
going to be temporarily

1818.96 --> 1826.64
and you will understand exactly why

1822.96 --> 1826.64
you know how that works

1827.2 --> 1831.8400000000001
yeah if

1828.96 --> 1834.88
something gets you to go emotionally out

1831.84 --> 1836.399
of control like that take it personal

1834.88 --> 1838.96
and defy

1836.399 --> 1841.039
the chat rules effectively defy the

1838.96 --> 1842.159
order that is present in my chat or

1841.039 --> 1844.1589999999999
should be

1842.159 --> 1846.48
yeah then i'm gonna remove you because

1844.159 --> 1848.3200000000002
of that that doesn't mean you should be

1846.48 --> 1852.24
afraid

1848.32 --> 1854.08
to even share what you disagree about

1852.24 --> 1857.88
with me

1854.08 --> 1857.8799999999999
like that's ridiculous

1858.159 --> 1863.48
i'm not like

1859.76 --> 1863.48
liberal government

1864.159 --> 1868.64
why would you think it works that day

1870.399 --> 1876.7199999999998

1896.08 --> 1902.799
it doesn't exist that [ __ ] doesn't exist

1899.279 --> 1906.0
all you have to do is be a [ __ ] robot

1902.799 --> 1907.519
let devil decisions just run all over

1906.0 --> 1909.519
you

1907.519 --> 1911.84
basically become a demonic slave and

1909.519 --> 1914.24
then oh yeah you're wreaking the cash

1911.84 --> 1916.9599999999998
sure all you have to be is a [ __ ]

1914.24 --> 1920.36
little demon slave without a soul

1916.96 --> 1920.3600000000001
that's all

1928.37 --> 1931.76
[Music]

1938.96 --> 1944.48
there it's an individual

1942.08 --> 1946.1589999999999
that's never spoken up and is then

1944.48 --> 1949.84
meddling

1946.159 --> 1949.8400000000001
that's what's wrong yeah

1950.48 --> 1954.64
if i don't know you you don't have a

1953.6 --> 1955.6789999999999
right

1954.64 --> 1959.1200000000001
to get

1955.679 --> 1961.76
involved in the chat

1959.12 --> 1964.7199999999998
you understand

1961.76 --> 1967.919
you don't have a right to get involved

1964.72 --> 1969.2
in our personal and social conduct

1987.6 --> 1991.36
influence

up when i'm calm

1993.84 --> 1997.84
when i'm just talking

that's when you should speak up that's

1997.84 --> 2005.1999999999998
how you eventually get to be involved in

2001.679 --> 2007.8400000000001
these types of affairs you understand

2005.2 --> 2010.559
you have to actually get involved

2017.12 --> 2023.36

2077.839 --> 2081.679

2078.639 --> 2082.96
by actually getting involved and not

2081.679 --> 2084.879

that never get involved unless either

2188.44 --> 2193.28
dissatisfied about my attitude and then

2190.88 --> 2196.96
they should have to start nagging

2193.28 --> 2201.8390000000004
like they have any authority you don't

2196.96 --> 2201.839

2297.28 --> 2302.2400000000002
but yeah i've been thinking that

2299.92 --> 2302.2400000000002
maybe

2302.56 --> 2309.599
i'll do a members only setting from now

2306.079 --> 2312.079
on just members only and outsiders can

2309.599 --> 2314.56
all go [ __ ] themselves with your

2312.079 --> 2317.3590000000004
leeching of my information never

2314.56 --> 2319.599
speaking up probably trying to rob my

2317.359 --> 2322.16
concepts try to integrate them in your

2319.599 --> 2323.839
own little financial scam projects on

2322.16 --> 2326.72
media

2323.839 --> 2328.4
and not actually paying me while i my

2326.72 --> 2332.8799999999997
debt grows

2328.4 --> 2337.079
i'm sick of it i'm sick of all of this

2332.88 --> 2337.079
this is not worth it anymore

2344.16 --> 2346.48
huh

2346.56 --> 2350.4
hey godzilla thank you for that

2351.28 --> 2357.52

2369.599 --> 2372.76
for that

2382.32 --> 2390.4
yeah but gorzilla though with membership

2385.839 --> 2395.16
only ranches can also watch it i think

2390.4 --> 2395.1600000000003
i'm not entirely sure but i think so

2398.8 --> 2402.96
and no people do not come here for money

2401.28 --> 2404.079
making ideas

2402.96 --> 2406.64
i'm not

2404.079 --> 2406.6400000000003
like that

2407.76 --> 2413.0400000000004
i'm not about that ever like never

2419.76 --> 2426.6400000000003
what i try to do is find a way through

2424.16 --> 2429.04
look where nobody looks

2426.64 --> 2431.2
not for money-making oh let's make a

2429.04 --> 2434.8
more box oh how can i

2431.2 --> 2437.68
[ __ ] more people into just all going

2434.8 --> 2440.48
along with this standard buy-in of some

2437.68 --> 2443.2799999999997
item to make a lot of money no that's

2440.48 --> 2445.44
not what i do what i do is try to figure

2443.28 --> 2447.3590000000004
out structural solutions while

2445.44 --> 2450.16
everybody's all squirting over their

2447.359 --> 2451.04
money opportunities yeah that's what i

2450.16 --> 2453.839
do

2451.04 --> 2458.0
i like to figure out

2453.839 --> 2460.48
how to truly make things better without

2458.0 --> 2463.68
a financial

2460.48 --> 2466.72
thing that you can exploit

2463.68 --> 2468.16
because i [ __ ] hate that i hate that

2466.72 --> 2471.359
system

2468.16 --> 2473.68
to turn everybody into like

2471.359 --> 2476.4
just relentless devils that are just

2473.68 --> 2479.44
sucking the world dry i'm sick of it i'm

2476.4 --> 2481.599
sick of that system i don't give a [ __ ]

2479.44 --> 2484.16
about your money making opportunities

2481.599 --> 2485.28
all i want is for things that just work

2484.16 --> 2488.72
better

2485.28 --> 2492.44
that's what i want for things to just

2488.72 --> 2492.4399999999996
work better

2502.24 --> 2508.4399999999996
ah

2504.319 --> 2508.44
why are you talking about clutch

2514.8 --> 2519.92
but yeah thank you very much godzilla

2516.56 --> 2520.839
for handing out the membership systems

2519.92 --> 2523.6800000000003
that's

2520.839 --> 2526.0
nice a paypal donation would also be

2523.68 --> 2526.0
great

2530.64 --> 2535.5989999999997
i mean that's in the essence what is

2532.96 --> 2537.92
fueling most of my frustration yeah

2535.599 --> 2539.76
when i get really pissed off

2537.92 --> 2542.8
i can bet you

2539.76 --> 2545.3590000000004
pun intended my bottom dollar

2542.8 --> 2548.4
that it is because of financial issues

2545.359 --> 2552.0
because when i'm doing great financially

2548.4 --> 2554.4
i don't get pissed off

2552.0 --> 2556.4
i usually don't

2554.4 --> 2558.56
unless somebody's really pushing it

2556.4 --> 2559.44
making something personal

2558.56 --> 2562.0
right

2559.44 --> 2564.4
then i might get pissed all over that

2562.0 --> 2566.72
but just not

2564.4 --> 2568.64
having good stats when it comes to

2566.72 --> 2571.4399999999996
financial situation

2568.64 --> 2574.44
is really aggravating and unnerving to

2571.44 --> 2574.44
me

2590.96 --> 2596.079
yeah yeah gadget inspector i am that's

2593.359 --> 2597.92
exactly what i am doing

2596.079 --> 2600.4
i'm almost announcing that i'm gonna

2597.92 --> 2603.04

2600.4 --> 2606.0

2653.04 --> 2657.04
what are my thoughts on a youtube

2654.56 --> 2659.52
alternative

2657.04 --> 2662.52
well how about everywhere else but

2659.52 --> 2662.52
youtube

2663.92 --> 2668.48
yeah and when i do that i'm literally

2665.839 --> 2673.2799999999997
gonna delete every video that i ever

2668.48 --> 2673.28
made you understand i will delete it all

2674.079 --> 2678.7200000000003
with [ __ ] ad money and everything

2676.48 --> 2681.76
you'll never the only thing you will be

2678.72 --> 2684.319
able to find back is some shitty troll

2681.76 --> 2687.7200000000003
videos about me yeah that's all you'll

2684.319 --> 2687.72
find back

2697.44 --> 2702.079
but yeah sure i'd like to try [ __ ]

2699.52 --> 2703.52
shoot i'd even like to try rockfin i

2702.079 --> 2705.92
mean

2703.52 --> 2708.079
i don't really particularly like those

2705.92 --> 2710.4
systems or at least i don't really like

2708.079 --> 2712.2400000000002
rockfin i think bitchu is great but it's

2710.4 --> 2715.839
not for live streaming doesn't work like

2712.24 --> 2715.839
that it's just upload videos

2717.359 --> 2723.68
dude if i could i try

2720.359 --> 2727.119
unauthorized.tv if they have me probably

2723.68 --> 2729.52
not i'm angry i get dark so i don't know

2727.119 --> 2731.6800000000003
man maybe they would i don't know how

2729.52 --> 2733.52
the hell that all works anymore maybe

2731.68 --> 2736.0789999999997
don't they think i'm too lazy or

2733.52 --> 2738.56
something i don't know i'd like to

2736.079 --> 2740.5600000000004
i'd like to be part of that

2738.56 --> 2742.4
that would be great

2740.56 --> 2745.599
would i be able to financially get

2742.4 --> 2748.1600000000003
around because of that probably not

2745.599 --> 2750.56
so i don't really know

2748.16 --> 2754.56
i don't really know what to do it seems

2750.56 --> 2757.92
like you just have to be an unnatural

2754.56 --> 2761.2799999999997
tamed [ __ ] to actually get around on

2757.92 --> 2763.359
media entirely all of it

2761.28 --> 2767.8390000000004
you want to get around on media you have

2763.359 --> 2767.839
to be an unnatural human being

2772.72 --> 2776.48
how many years have i been trying to

2774.24 --> 2779.04
make this work

2776.48 --> 2782.079
six years

2779.04 --> 2782.079
six years straight

2786.839 --> 2794.0789999999997
learning no i hate that i hate doing

2790.56 --> 2796.319
that gadget inspector i do not like

2794.079 --> 2798.319
breaking video editing i don't have the

2796.319 --> 2800.16
proper equipment for it

2798.319 --> 2801.119
and i don't have the patience for it i

2800.16 --> 2802.72
hate it

2801.119 --> 2804.7200000000003
it sucks

2802.72 --> 2807.68
i don't know how other people keep doing

2804.72 --> 2809.7599999999998

2807.68 --> 2813.44

well yes in a way yeah

2821.92 --> 2828.16
he is but he's a freaking comedian

2824.64 --> 2831.839
comedians are unnatural all of them

2828.16 --> 2831.839
it's the only way it works

2832.16 --> 2837.0789999999997
and it is a really weird question yeah

2862.8 --> 2868.96
collins on my show might spice it up oh

2865.92 --> 2871.599
really you need to spice it up really

2868.96 --> 2873.28
so what people are gonna call in that

2871.599 --> 2876.319
aren't literally gonna drag the

2873.28 --> 2878.0
intellectual level down by like 300

2876.319 --> 2880.96
percent

2878.0 --> 2880.96
who's going to call in

2882.48 --> 2886.64
gadget inspector you know that if i do

2884.88 --> 2889.2000000000003
that it's pretty much going to be

2886.64 --> 2890.0
numpties that are going to say oh hello

2889.2 --> 2891.2799999999997
hey

2890.0 --> 2893.28

2893.28 --> 2897.44
something or oh

2896.079 --> 2899.119
dude

2897.44 --> 2901.76
if there's actually going to be a good

2899.119 --> 2905.839
conversation that's even possible then

2901.76 --> 2905.8390000000004
it would pop up in the chat

2913.119 --> 2918.0
have you ever seen like jim bob's chat

2915.68 --> 2921.359
his conversation the conversations in

2918.0 --> 2924.559
his chats are amazing you know why

2921.359 --> 2926.96
because i'm in them and my conversations

2924.559 --> 2929.44
the things that i say are [ __ ]

2926.96 --> 2931.2
amazing they are

2929.44 --> 2935.359
and he knows it

2931.2 --> 2935.359
and other people in there too

2935.599 --> 2942.28
they actually ponder upon things and

2937.76 --> 2942.28
share deeper thinking a lot

2944.4 --> 2947.839
now i'm not saying that you guys never

2946.24 --> 2949.7599999999998
do that here

2947.839 --> 2952.96
a lot of times it just seems to be like

2949.76 --> 2952.96
just hanging around

2953.28 --> 2957.2000000000003
sometimes even sense like boredom which

2956.319 --> 2962.24
is

2957.2 --> 2962.24
from you not in response to me here

2963.04 --> 2967.52
maybe it's just the time of the day

2964.4 --> 2972.2400000000002
maybe just this very specific worldly

2967.52 --> 2974.24
time slot is just the worst possible

2972.24 --> 2979.2
i think it might be that it might just

2974.24 --> 2979.2
be the worst imaginable time slot

2979.28 --> 2984.7200000000003
which means that i would have to

2981.44 --> 2988.079
absolutely end the early bird show

2984.72 --> 2990.0
and just not gonna do that anymore

2988.079 --> 2992.6400000000003
i'll just see whatever the [ __ ] i'm

2990.0 --> 2994.319
gonna do then

2992.64 --> 2996.5589999999997
and it's gonna be different and i'm not

2994.319 --> 3000.4
gonna be fresh and i'm not gonna give

2996.559 --> 3002.96
you revolutionary spontaneous ideas and

3000.4 --> 3007.079
insights because that happens in this

3002.96 --> 3007.079
time slot with me

3009.67 --> 3014.389
[Music]

3018.1 --> 3021.25
[Music]

3024.75 --> 3027.9
[Music]

3042.88 --> 3047.92
prepare nothing before the show

3045.599 --> 3050.1600000000003
that's not entirely true

3047.92 --> 3052.2400000000002
i do prepare something i have subjects

3050.16 --> 3055.2
it's just that

3052.24 --> 3057.839
you do it every day and you talk

3055.2 --> 3060.5589999999997
every day for two hours

3057.839 --> 3063.44
and oh oh yeah and you don't really get

3060.559 --> 3066.48
paid for it in order to at least spend

3063.44 --> 3068.96
another six hours just trying to be like

3066.48 --> 3070.88
a news show or something right because i

3068.96 --> 3074.0
don't get paid for this

3070.88 --> 3075.599
i barely do i can barely freaking eat

3074.0 --> 3078.8
yeah i'm not

3075.599 --> 3082.48
doing all the activity and then on top

3078.8 --> 3085.3590000000004
of that like spend two hours or more

3082.48 --> 3088.4
like preparing some kind of a

3085.359 --> 3091.359
subject script

3088.4 --> 3091.359
it doesn't work

3091.839 --> 3099.04
i do i am dependent on my interactions

3096.16 --> 3101.839
but it's not just that it's not just the

3099.04 --> 3105.92
interaction it's also financing i'm

3101.839 --> 3107.52
dependent on donations to keep going

3105.92 --> 3108.8
and that's the real

3107.52 --> 3111.119
tough part

3108.8 --> 3113.44
yeah i could deal with that everybody

3111.119 --> 3117.04
might be like uh i don't feel smart

3113.44 --> 3120.96
today i just want to be a little goofy

3117.04 --> 3123.68
i get that if i'd get paid if i actually

3120.96 --> 3126.319
was able to get around i'd be perfectly

3123.68 --> 3128.72
fine with that goof around all you want

3126.319 --> 3129.599
i just want to be able to eat god damn

3128.72 --> 3132.319
it

3129.599 --> 3135.04
i want to eat

3132.319 --> 3138.68
i don't have painting for that [ __ ] if i

3135.04 --> 3138.68
can't even eat

3162.88 --> 3165.599
interrupted by neighbor at my door

3164.64 --> 3168.64
wanting

3165.599 --> 3170.319
me to help all right

3168.64 --> 3173.04
don't worry

3170.319 --> 3173.04
it's all fine

3176.319 --> 3181.52
it's just that

3178.319 --> 3183.359
verbal support is all cute and nice

3181.52 --> 3185.2
but it's the financial support that

3183.359 --> 3190.0789999999997
actually keeps me going and that

3185.2 --> 3190.0789999999997
prevents me from going ballistic

3190.559 --> 3194.599
over almost nothing

3201.76 --> 3206.96
do i need to remind you that my country

3204.72 --> 3208.64
is like in the middle of like a giant

3206.96 --> 3211.599
inflation wave

3208.64 --> 3214.8799999999997
and everything everything has like

3211.599 --> 3217.52
become 20 to 40 percent more expensive

3214.88 --> 3220.88
in the last three months

3217.52 --> 3224.16
yeah without my social welfare actually

3220.88 --> 3227.119
going up 20 to 40 percent

3224.16 --> 3230.359
you know how terrible my predicament is

3227.119 --> 3230.359
right now

3238.88 --> 3243.359
crypto i'm not gonna talk about it's

3241.28 --> 3244.88
okay ben white for you for suggesting it

3243.359 --> 3247.2799999999997
but i'm not gonna do freaking

3244.88 --> 3251.04
cryptocurrency

3247.28 --> 3255.599
dude if i

3251.04 --> 3255.599
i don't do financial [ __ ]

3256.16 --> 3261.839
i can't stand that i can't stand

3259.04 --> 3264.839
cryptocurrency i literally zone out

3261.839 --> 3264.839
immediately

3278.319 --> 3284.48
oh there are more jobs now oh yeah yeah

3280.799 --> 3288.64
and do they actually provide a a

3284.48 --> 3291.88
viable income stasmaretz yeah do they

3288.64 --> 3291.8799999999997
do they

3292.559 --> 3297.44
yeah how many of these

3294.48 --> 3300.4
oh jobs that are more available than

3297.44 --> 3303.359
people how many of them actually even

3300.4 --> 3306.96
make more money than you just get from

3303.359 --> 3309.52
social welfare the basic version yeah

3306.96 --> 3311.52
how many of those jobs actually provide

3309.52 --> 3312.96
you with a good income

3311.52 --> 3315.04
huh

3312.96 --> 3318.0
maybe there's a reason

3315.04 --> 3320.96
why people aren't taking the jobs

3318.0 --> 3324.64
because they are too horrific

3320.96 --> 3326.4
they're not actually viable

3324.64 --> 3331.799
you just end up

3326.4 --> 3331.799
like a slave that can barely get around

3352.64 --> 3359.04
online jobs use your pc to make money

3355.599 --> 3360.88

3385.119 --> 3389.44
busying therapy

3387.68 --> 3390.3999999999996

4714.239 --> 4719.879999999999
actually speak up in chat but

4716.64 --> 4719.88
is that

4720.0 --> 4722.64

4746.84 --> 4751.679
baby oh okay

4749.76 --> 4754.0

4751.679 --> 4756.2390000000005
just say your name out loud like that

4754.0 --> 4758.4
and yes i know by just giving down an

4756.239 --> 4760.879999999999
analogy i just made a whole bunch of

4758.4 --> 4763.04
trolls squirt really hard because that's

4760.88 --> 4765.84
exactly what they think of me

4763.04 --> 4768.32
i'm just a baby screaming

4765.84 --> 4770.4800000000005
that's what they think

4768.32 --> 4772.08
it feels a bit weird though just i

4770.48 --> 4774.48
didn't think it was possible i didn't

4772.08 --> 4778.08
think i was gonna get it i really didn't

4774.48 --> 4779.678999999999
because i like it's been so dry that i'm

4778.08 --> 4781.6
just thinking like you guys are

4779.679 --> 4784.08
literally all going bankrupt and you're

4781.6 --> 4787.120000000001
just trying to survive yourself

4784.08 --> 4788.96
so i feel almost guilty even asking all

4787.12 --> 4791.92
that

4788.96 --> 4796.08
virtually but i need to because i i just

4791.92 --> 4797.1990000000005

4809.92 --> 4815.679

4812.639 --> 4819.04

4815.679 --> 4821.28

4819.04 --> 4824.48
money that's how [ __ ] disastrous the

4821.28 --> 4825.679

5106.08 --> 5111.8
gonna take before something like this is

5107.84 --> 5111.8
gonna have to happen again

5113.28 --> 5117.36
i mean this [ __ ] does not make me feel

5115.6 --> 5119.84
good about myself

5117.36 --> 5122.799999999999
another paypal okay

5119.84 --> 5124.8
well you guys just oh if the damn just

5122.8 --> 5128.0
broke open that is something that does

5124.8 --> 5129.92
make me feel good about myself

5128.0 --> 5132.56
though it's always so weird and when

5129.92 --> 5132.56
that happens

5133.36 --> 5136.639
yeah

5134.32 --> 5139.199
thank you man

5136.639 --> 5139.1990000000005
what the

5139.52 --> 5145.120000000001
that's a very weird photo by the way the

5142.4 --> 5147.92
os watson but thank you for that

5145.12 --> 5150.239
thank you for the paypal

5147.92 --> 5153.88
yeah i think i just made it past 100.

5150.239 --> 5153.879999999999
thank you very much

5167.6 --> 5174.159000000001
einstein's cousin oh yeah that's right

5170.239 --> 5174.159
yeah yeah i remember you told me yeah

5177.199 --> 5181.638999999999
i named your store that's cool

5190.56 --> 5195.120000000001
anyone see that clip qb put up where he

5193.36 --> 5198.0
woke someone up

5195.12 --> 5202.159
which one rick peck you mean the one

5198.0 --> 5202.159
that he premiered this tuesday

5203.12 --> 5205.76
was that it

5206.48 --> 5213.04
you are good for it no no i'm not gadget

5209.52 --> 5213.040000000001
inspector no i'm not

5217.92 --> 5224.159
but i'll be good for now

5221.12 --> 5227.599999999999
what picture

5224.159 --> 5230.159
the picture on on your paypal

5227.6 --> 5230.159000000001
is that you

5232.4 --> 5236.92
there was a picture added onto it

5241.36 --> 5246.0
never knew what e equals mc squared

5244.32 --> 5250.0
meant

5246.0 --> 5250.0
yeah yeah yeah it's amazing isn't it

5251.36 --> 5254.719
einstein

5252.4 --> 5256.159
married his cousin twice

5254.719 --> 5260.4800000000005
it is

5256.159 --> 5260.48
hilarious how easy that fits

5260.639 --> 5264.96
it makes me wonder whether it was always

5263.04 --> 5268.56
just complete

5264.96 --> 5270.4
satire on einstein's part that he

5268.56 --> 5271.360000000001
like was he

5270.4 --> 5274.48
made

5271.36 --> 5277.12
to do that on purpose

5274.48 --> 5279.5199999999995
i mean e equals mc squared is pretty

5277.12 --> 5282.639
much [ __ ] like it doesn't really

5279.52 --> 5285.4400000000005
mean anything it really it doesn't it is

5282.639 --> 5287.76
completely useless

5285.44 --> 5289.839999999999
it's just stupid relativity nonsense

5287.76 --> 5292.0
which is fundamentally nonsense and

5289.84 --> 5294.0
non-applicable

5292.0 --> 5296.8
so

5294.0 --> 5298.0
did like his handlers tell him like yeah

5296.8 --> 5300.159000000001
you're gonna have to make this

5298.0 --> 5302.48
revolutionary formula that's gonna be

5300.159 --> 5305.599999999999
praised forever and it's gonna be

5302.48 --> 5306.839999999999
you marrying your cousin twice

5305.6 --> 5308.400000000001
math it for

5306.84 --> 5309.1990000000005
us

5308.4 --> 5312.48
like

5309.199 --> 5312.48
i wouldn't be surprised

5316.4 --> 5321.5199999999995
how's the heat been kevlar not too bad

5319.44 --> 5324.32
not too bad it's it's quite beautiful

5321.52 --> 5324.320000000001
weather actually

5324.88 --> 5330.719
it's been really nice

5327.04 --> 5333.5199999999995
not too terrible hot

5330.719 --> 5335.04
100 euros for a two-hour show ain't bad

5333.52 --> 5338.320000000001
yeah

5335.04 --> 5341.199
if you exclude that literally had zero

5338.32 --> 5344.0
paypals for seven days straight

5341.199 --> 5346.08
yeah gadget inspector

5344.0 --> 5348.8
well it's not that great then either if

5346.08 --> 5351.84
you consider that

5348.8 --> 5351.84
a week

5353.52 --> 5357.4800000000005
ah that is you okay cool no now i know

5356.159 --> 5360.509999999999
that

5357.48 --> 5360.509999999999
[Music]

5367.679 --> 5370.159
anyway

5372.239 --> 5378.5599999999995
yeah temperature right now is 23 degrees

5374.96 --> 5380.88
celsius over here

5378.56 --> 5382.88
but it's just that wind is like kind of

5380.88 --> 5386.0
nice and cold so it's really pleasant

5382.88 --> 5389.36
it's sunny there have been trails

5386.0 --> 5393.28
but it's not it's not like all fogged up

5389.36 --> 5394.96
up there it's just a couple of clouds

5393.28 --> 5396.88
and still some blue in between there

5394.96 --> 5399.04
with plenty of sun and just that nice

5396.88 --> 5401.12
cold breezing

5399.04 --> 5402.96
wind

5401.12 --> 5404.88
so yeah it's not the weather the weather

5402.96 --> 5406.4800000000005
is great it's just

5404.88 --> 5408.96
i'm

5406.48 --> 5412.0
and i had a great night's sleep and then

5408.96 --> 5416.4800000000005
i just woke up and it just

5412.0 --> 5416.48
started yelling at things realizing like

5416.88 --> 5422.56
i'm literally just sliding down into

5420.08 --> 5424.96
financial hell that's how i woke up

5422.56 --> 5424.96
today

5427.28 --> 5432.88
everyone yeah probably gadget inspector

5430.639 --> 5432.88
look

5433.36 --> 5436.5599999999995
let's just

5434.36 --> 5439.04
[Music]

5436.56 --> 5442.84
talk about other things now the last 25

5439.04 --> 5442.84
minutes that will be great

5464.0 --> 5467.04
anyway

5465.01 --> 5469.360000000001
[Music]

5467.04 --> 5469.36
right

5471.28 --> 5476.32
i was gonna talk about

5473.92 --> 5478.159
spirit mechanics continuing the subject

5476.32 --> 5480.239
from yesterday the

5478.159 --> 5482.4
supernatural

5480.239 --> 5485.36
substance

5482.4 --> 5488.08
or rather the energy we respond with

5485.36 --> 5491.5199999999995
to being informed

5488.08 --> 5494.719
and then having moral implications

5491.52 --> 5495.92
and that basically arising this energy

5494.719 --> 5498.08
that

5495.92 --> 5500.4
that charges us like a battery and it

5498.08 --> 5502.8
can be polarized

5500.4 --> 5504.96
positive or negative

5502.8 --> 5507.84
right but that comes from as like a

5504.96 --> 5509.199
charge that comes out of the

5507.84 --> 5513.12
consciousness

5509.199 --> 5513.12
receiving the information

5513.52 --> 5519.52
that has the moral implications and then

5516.639 --> 5523.28
the response by the individual and that

5519.52 --> 5524.96
response then seeds springs forth the

5523.28 --> 5527.36
energy

5524.96 --> 5529.84
that charges us like a battery and that

5527.36 --> 5532.08
you can literally sense on people

5529.84 --> 5532.8
visually at a distance you can see like

5532.08 --> 5535.6
oh

5532.8 --> 5537.4400000000005
wow that person is really vibrant right

5535.6 --> 5540.400000000001
you call it vibrant well that's that

5537.44 --> 5540.4
charged energy

5540.56 --> 5545.04
and it is

5542.639 --> 5547.1990000000005
usually related to

5545.04 --> 5549.76
morality

5547.199 --> 5554.0
and it's its own substance and i just i

5549.76 --> 5554.0
got this crystal clear in my mind

5556.88 --> 5561.679
i need to check my mega millions lotto

5559.52 --> 5564.4800000000005
okay kevlar

5561.679 --> 5564.4800000000005
good luck with that

5566.96 --> 5570.56
right so that's what i really wanted to

5568.719 --> 5573.04
talk about today

5570.56 --> 5577.120000000001
and then i just got really pissed off

5573.04 --> 5577.12
for like an hour and 30 minutes

5582.639 --> 5587.4400000000005
and it's really kind of stupid it's not

5584.639 --> 5589.28
a good way i mean i had grievances i

5587.44 --> 5591.599999999999
shared them it's just that when i'm

5589.28 --> 5593.84
really pissed off and loud it's

5591.6 --> 5595.52
technically the not the most effective

5593.84 --> 5597.360000000001
point to do that

5595.52 --> 5599.92
but it was for me that

5597.36 --> 5602.639
what i needed because it's been

5599.92 --> 5604.159
pushing on me i've been kind of like

5602.639 --> 5607.28
annoyed

5604.159 --> 5609.36
i've been annoyed by people saying to me

5607.28 --> 5610.719
in my chat that follow me that respect

5609.36 --> 5614.32
me saying

5610.719 --> 5616.4800000000005
i don't really agree with everything but

5614.32 --> 5618.239
i do appreciate right because it's

5616.48 --> 5619.44
non-specific

5618.239 --> 5620.638999999999
and so

5619.44 --> 5623.759999999999
at first

5620.639 --> 5626.08
i might even realize oh right oh that's

5623.76 --> 5628.400000000001
the guy that's actually a baller so of

5626.08 --> 5631.36
course he's not gonna agree with me on

5628.4 --> 5632.159
that the earth is flat right

5631.36 --> 5633.92
but

5632.159 --> 5637.04
that doesn't stick

5633.92 --> 5639.1990000000005
if you then just completely hide

5637.04 --> 5640.8
the disagreement and just say oh i don't

5639.199 --> 5643.12
really agree and you just keep saying

5640.8 --> 5644.96
that and not mentioning what it is and

5643.12 --> 5647.76
not speaking out

5644.96 --> 5649.52
for your point of view in my chat for

5647.76 --> 5651.6
like months and months then i kind of

5649.52 --> 5653.52
just don't remember

5651.6 --> 5655.1990000000005
what you're even disagreeing about and

5653.52 --> 5658.639
it's annoying because it feels like

5655.199 --> 5663.44
you're withholding information from me

5658.639 --> 5663.4400000000005
i need specifics i need openness

5664.0 --> 5669.679
with these things i don't mind if you

5666.719 --> 5672.56
disagree with me that's why i even have

5669.679 --> 5677.04
ballers in my chat

5672.56 --> 5680.080000000001
what i do mind is if you don't inform me

5677.04 --> 5682.239
about what

5680.08 --> 5685.119
uh

5682.239 --> 5687.839999999999
but i i overreacted a bit so sorry about

5685.119 --> 5687.839999999999
that

5703.199 --> 5708.719
that's right bjc net yeah because it re

5705.679 --> 5712.4
it's like a spiritual antenna and some

5708.719 --> 5715.119
empaths have the longest antennas they

5712.4 --> 5717.5199999999995
immediately pick up on it

5715.119 --> 5719.839999999999
even more than other information they

5717.52 --> 5722.2390000000005
just it like they have

5719.84 --> 5723.92
the polarized energy view and that's

5722.239 --> 5725.599999999999
what they then see they see oh this

5723.92 --> 5727.52
contrast that contrast this is the

5725.6 --> 5729.280000000001
chemistry that come out of it

5727.52 --> 5731.360000000001
not what they're talking about because

5729.28 --> 5733.5199999999995
it's not even relevant a lot of the time

5731.36 --> 5736.239
it's just blabbering people don't know

5733.52 --> 5739.119000000001
what they talk about usually

5736.239 --> 5741.678999999999
but the sensory information of like how

5739.119 --> 5744.96
are they polarized are they charged

5741.679 --> 5748.88
that is like much more important because

5744.96 --> 5750.4800000000005
that's what their subconscious is doing

5748.88 --> 5752.639
not their conscience the consciousness

5750.48 --> 5755.759999999999
could just be superficially blabbering

5752.639 --> 5757.52
about nothing just wasting time

5755.76 --> 5759.84
the energy inside

5757.52 --> 5762.320000000001
that reveals as to what their

5759.84 --> 5763.52
subconsciousness is doing the other side

5762.32 --> 5765.84
of them

5763.52 --> 5768.2390000000005
and it will always have influence

5765.84 --> 5771.6
because the charge energy that they have

5768.239 --> 5775.199
in the level is gonna change the social

5771.6 --> 5776.8
dynamic it's gonna have like a sparking

5775.199 --> 5777.839999999999
influence

5776.8 --> 5781.84
or like

5777.84 --> 5783.6
a magnetic influence to other people's

5781.84 --> 5786.88
inner

5783.6 --> 5788.96
situation their their moral energy see

5786.88 --> 5791.52
so even though the consciousness is just

5788.96 --> 5792.4
completely unaware

5791.52 --> 5794.320000000001
about

5792.4 --> 5796.32
like what's going on

5794.32 --> 5799.599999999999
the subconsciousness

5796.32 --> 5804.159
will always respond to

5799.6 --> 5806.2390000000005
this moral-based polarized energy

5804.159 --> 5809.04
and that's really interesting to realize

5806.239 --> 5810.799999999999
and i am constantly dealing with that it

5809.04 --> 5813.6
for me

5810.8 --> 5816.08
with my social interactions

5813.6 --> 5817.6
and this this sounds worse than it

5816.08 --> 5819.199
really is

5817.6 --> 5822.0
three quarters of the time i don't even

5819.199 --> 5823.678999999999
listen to what people say anymore

5822.0 --> 5826.48
like at all

5823.679 --> 5828.88
i'll listen to them talking i won't

5826.48 --> 5831.839999999999
actually try to figure out even what the

5828.88 --> 5833.36
technicalities is of what they're saying

5831.84 --> 5835.6
you know why

5833.36 --> 5837.679
because i know it's gonna turn out to be

5835.6 --> 5841.4400000000005
irrelevant it's much more important that

5837.679 --> 5844.4800000000005
i tune in to what they're charged with

5841.44 --> 5845.839999999999
because when i get that right then in

5844.48 --> 5848.718999999999
the middle of whatever they're talking

5845.84 --> 5851.76
about i can just insert the right

5848.719 --> 5854.32
sentence to like give it a little nudge

5851.76 --> 5856.400000000001
on the inside their right way i've been

5854.32 --> 5859.599999999999
using this technique

5856.4 --> 5861.119
as an empath with my friend inaiment and

5859.6 --> 5863.4400000000005
that i talk over the phone it doesn't

5861.119 --> 5865.36
always go right sometime last time we

5863.44 --> 5868.0
talked it actually went completely wrong

5865.36 --> 5871.759999999999
because she literally started to act out

5868.0 --> 5873.92
on me over her problem over her

5871.76 --> 5875.52
frustration with her boyfriend that

5873.92 --> 5877.679
basically turned out to be kind of a

5875.52 --> 5879.4400000000005
psychopath and she broke up with him and

5877.679 --> 5881.36
then she had frustrations over him and

5879.44 --> 5883.119
she was projecting it onto me which is

5881.36 --> 5886.48
very familiar to me because that's what

5883.119 --> 5888.96
my mother did with me

5886.48 --> 5892.0
and i hate that

5888.96 --> 5894.4
told her then i hang up

5892.0 --> 5897.04
but in most other situations when that

5894.4 --> 5899.92
specifically does not happen

5897.04 --> 5902.48
i'm very capable of just hearing all

5899.92 --> 5905.04
their venting and all their frustrations

5902.48 --> 5907.199
and i'll just focus on that polarized

5905.04 --> 5910.239
energy more than all of their words

5907.199 --> 5911.839999999999
combined so that i can say exactly the

5910.239 --> 5914.799999999999
right thing in the right time that it's

5911.84 --> 5917.4400000000005
gonna fix it for them it's what i do

5914.8 --> 5919.84
it's therapeutical and that skill that i

5917.44 --> 5922.239
have that i can do with others on a

5919.84 --> 5926.159000000001
personal person-to-person conversation

5922.239 --> 5929.28
is based on my empathy skill of reading

5926.159 --> 5930.799999999999
the charged morality energy that they

5929.28 --> 5933.44
have

5930.8 --> 5935.84
i don't listen to their words i listen

5933.44 --> 5938.96
to their energy

5935.84 --> 5942.400000000001
because when you do that and you

5938.96 --> 5944.4
tactically respond on to that

5942.4 --> 5946.5599999999995
the conversation is going to turn out to

5944.4 --> 5951.4
be more effective for the person you're

5946.56 --> 5951.400000000001
talking to that's why i do it

5952.719 --> 5958.96
okay i'm glad at least i got that out

5956.0 --> 5962.4
not just me screaming at this

5958.96 --> 5962.4
at the screen in the show

5964.159 --> 5969.32
this is what i actually wanted to talk

5966.08 --> 5969.32
about today

5980.239 --> 5985.759999999999
do bring a lot of spice to this show i

5982.0 --> 5985.76
know i'm freaking spicy dude

5986.719 --> 5989.76
i like spicy

5990.639 --> 5995.04
right in a way this is

5992.719 --> 5998.4800000000005
too personal i guess but

5995.04 --> 6000.48
i kind of like women that are

5998.48 --> 6003.919999999999
that like to like

6000.48 --> 6007.919999999999
get into arguments i kind of like them

6003.92 --> 6009.52
as long as they they have control over

6007.92 --> 6012.08
it as long as they can enjoy it and

6009.52 --> 6014.88
they're not just always compulsively

6012.08 --> 6017.5199999999995
doing that because that i cannot stand

6014.88 --> 6020.88
if they like to get a bit spicy i like

6017.52 --> 6023.76
to get a bit spicy it's a great

6020.88 --> 6026.8
great medium to interact with to have

6023.76 --> 6029.05
passionate relationships

6026.8 --> 6030.320000000001
as long as you can get control

6029.05 --> 6033.679
[Music]

6030.32 --> 6037.199
right as long as that person's not gonna

6033.679 --> 6038.32
use their passion or theirs their

6037.199 --> 6041.759999999999
stance

6038.32 --> 6044.639
to try to dominate over you

6041.76 --> 6047.280000000001
i don't do that even i only do that with

6044.639 --> 6049.28
women when they like give me the signal

6047.28 --> 6051.599999999999
that they actually want that

6049.28 --> 6054.719
not before that is also by the way a

6051.6 --> 6054.719
subconscious signal

6055.199 --> 6059.5199999999995
so i like spicy i like

6057.76 --> 6063.280000000001
argument i do

6059.52 --> 6067.4400000000005
me when i was young my entire youth

6063.28 --> 6071.44
up to 21 pretty much at home

6067.44 --> 6073.28
always arguing oh i had to almost like

6071.44 --> 6075.839999999999
flee

6073.28 --> 6079.28
the group because well my parents were

6075.84 --> 6080.88
just always arguing my mother was always

6079.28 --> 6084.08
arguing and

6080.88 --> 6086.159000000001
in the group we were always arguing

6084.08 --> 6088.159
it's just always

6086.159 --> 6090.879999999999
never just never shutting up always

6088.159 --> 6093.04
being occupied with a hassle of some

6090.88 --> 6095.04
kind trying to figure it out it's also

6093.04 --> 6098.159
why i've become so intuitively

6095.04 --> 6100.88
instantaneous when it comes to

6098.159 --> 6102.239
giving an effective

6100.88 --> 6106.400000000001
solution

6102.239 --> 6108.0
to a complex problem in just a sentence

6106.4 --> 6111.599999999999
also comes from that because i've just

6108.0 --> 6113.119
constantly been trained like to never be

6111.6 --> 6116.0
still to never

6113.119 --> 6118.32
not think to always be automatically

6116.0 --> 6120.32
activated intellectually and figuring

6118.32 --> 6122.32
things out

6120.32 --> 6123.84
i've lived like that

6122.32 --> 6125.92
half my life

6123.84 --> 6128.719
continually

6125.92 --> 6128.719
and i like it

6133.36 --> 6138.5599999999995
i just don't like it when

6136.48 --> 6141.44
women

6138.56 --> 6142.88
are spicy and are smart and have ideas

6141.44 --> 6145.28
and are passionate

6142.88 --> 6147.119
and when they then don't they they like

6145.28 --> 6149.599999999999
they can't get control over it and

6147.119 --> 6153.36
they're like using their emotions as an

6149.6 --> 6154.639
excuse to parasite socially that i do

6153.36 --> 6157.199
not like

6154.639 --> 6159.96
it's very tough to find a woman that has

6157.199 --> 6163.839999999999
those skills and doesn't abuse them it's

6159.96 --> 6163.84
extremely tough to find

6165.44 --> 6170.239
right it's like oh look at all these

6167.76 --> 6172.8
amazing sorceresses

6170.239 --> 6176.08
but they're all possessed they're all

6172.8 --> 6178.159000000001
poisoned they're all poisoned by demons

6176.08 --> 6181.679
by society that just

6178.159 --> 6183.759999999999
took it all for granted and they just

6181.679 --> 6185.28
learned manipulative attitudes and

6183.76 --> 6187.92
tricks

6185.28 --> 6190.32
from society and people like accepted

6187.92 --> 6192.639
became normalized well that's all women

6190.32 --> 6195.04
with all great talent and skill that are

6192.639 --> 6197.6
all poisoned by demons with their

6195.04 --> 6197.6
behavior

6201.52 --> 6207.84
hey david r rice i appreciate that

6205.44 --> 6208.879999999999
i'd rather be yelled to than lie to as

6207.84 --> 6211.52
well

6208.88 --> 6211.52
absolutely

6212.239 --> 6217.28
do i ever go looking for a woman no

6215.04 --> 6220.8
i've never ever

6217.28 --> 6223.599999999999
gotten a relationship in my entire life

6220.8 --> 6226.400000000001
by going out looking for women

6223.6 --> 6228.96
not once

6226.4 --> 6231.36
it's so specific actually that like this

6228.96 --> 6233.76
second i would give up

6231.36 --> 6236.639
that's the second i would actually find

6233.76 --> 6238.159000000001
a woman because if i go look i don't

6236.639 --> 6240.639
find them

6238.159 --> 6242.0
it's like my internal energies become

6240.639 --> 6244.8
incorrect

6242.0 --> 6247.92
it won't be able to click if i go look

6244.8 --> 6251.04
for it the only way for me to do it is

6247.92 --> 6253.76
to just go places

6251.04 --> 6256.56
especially when it's new and just be

6253.76 --> 6258.2390000000005
there and like not think about

6256.56 --> 6261.280000000001
relationships

6258.239 --> 6263.5199999999995
and then when that happens

6261.28 --> 6267.599999999999
well then sometimes suddenly a woman

6263.52 --> 6270.88
just pops up and just approaches me

6267.6 --> 6273.679
or i'm like hey she's cute

6270.88 --> 6276.4800000000005
and like very

6273.679 --> 6278.88
superficial that's like if i don't have

6276.48 --> 6280.638999999999
this anticipation then i can just like

6278.88 --> 6282.88
superficially approach a woman that i

6280.639 --> 6286.400000000001
kind of like at the moment like hey

6282.88 --> 6288.4800000000005
and just kind of be chill and that works

6286.4 --> 6290.96
if i actually didn't have a mindset of

6288.48 --> 6293.199
i'm looking for a woman it never worked

6290.96 --> 6295.44
it's never worked for me

6293.199 --> 6299.5199999999995
it's why i don't look anymore

6295.44 --> 6301.678999999999
but i'm always like picking up like

6299.52 --> 6304.4800000000005
oh what kind of women are walking around

6301.679 --> 6307.36
like what is the woman on average and

6304.48 --> 6310.08
like every i i literally almost like a

6307.36 --> 6311.92
farmer keep track of women from a very

6310.08 --> 6313.92
young age on like

6311.92 --> 6315.84
little kids

6313.92 --> 6318.96
sound not that i'm

6315.84 --> 6320.96
because of them becoming older in 20

6318.96 --> 6323.119
years i think about these things i

6320.96 --> 6326.4800000000005
thought and i thought about those things

6323.119 --> 6328.4
even like 20 years ago

6326.48 --> 6331.04
i was always thinking like

6328.4 --> 6333.28
this is like a really young girl they're

6331.04 --> 6335.76
gonna go through the cycle of growing up

6333.28 --> 6337.92
can i already predict where they're what

6335.76 --> 6340.0
they're gonna be like based on how their

6337.92 --> 6342.08
mothers look like based on what they

6340.0 --> 6344.239
carry on the inside right now and their

6342.08 --> 6345.92
education and at everything everything

6344.239 --> 6348.0
everything everything and i'm always

6345.92 --> 6350.159
predicting like what are these women

6348.0 --> 6351.28
gonna grow into

6350.159 --> 6353.92
always

6351.28 --> 6357.639
i'm always doing is just my study my

6353.92 --> 6357.639
study of women

6359.52 --> 6365.52
but to actually find a woman or bump

6362.159 --> 6367.04
into that that is like suitable for me

6365.52 --> 6370.0
right now

6367.04 --> 6372.48
that's really rare

6370.0 --> 6374.4
i do bump or like

6372.48 --> 6376.959999999999
see women

6374.4 --> 6379.28
that would like to probably get into

6376.96 --> 6381.84
relationship with me i'm not joking

6379.28 --> 6384.639
really in all kinds of age categories

6381.84 --> 6387.360000000001
especially like

6384.639 --> 6389.76
between 30 and 50 a lot of women that

6387.36 --> 6391.679
actually find me attractive

6389.76 --> 6393.6
maybe it's the mustache or something or

6391.679 --> 6396.56
i don't know what it is

6393.6 --> 6399.6
but that's not gonna work i don't i'm

6396.56 --> 6403.280000000001
not i'm looking for a relationship

6399.6 --> 6403.280000000001
that's gonna turn into a baby

6405.04 --> 6408.44
that's it

6411.36 --> 6414.549999999999
[Music]

6416.639 --> 6421.76
if i went out with gadget

6419.28 --> 6423.84

6421.76 --> 6427.360000000001
right but would she be

6423.84 --> 6427.360000000001
insane as well

6427.76 --> 6431.84
would she actually be good person

6430.719 --> 6433.44
smart

6431.84 --> 6435.119000000001
dynamic

6433.44 --> 6437.44
ambitious

6435.119 --> 6439.199
or just really beautiful and totally

6437.44 --> 6441.5199999999995
abusing her beauty

6439.199 --> 6442.719
by being a manipulative demon her entire

6441.52 --> 6444.719
life

6442.719 --> 6447.52
right i don't need

6444.719 --> 6450.0
like a really beautiful woman for a date

6447.52 --> 6454.4400000000005
so i can squirt with her

6459.92 --> 6465.679
beautiful lady i would be extremely

6462.719 --> 6465.679
happy about that

6467.6 --> 6472.320000000001

6687.52 --> 6690.52
um

6704.159 --> 6708.5599999999995
to come there their own conclusions

6707.36 --> 6711.5199999999995
well

6708.56 --> 6713.4400000000005
that all depends

6711.52 --> 6715.679
that's your opinion of course tasmaret

6713.44 --> 6715.678999999999
but

6715.76 --> 6720.4800000000005
sometimes some people

6717.679 --> 6724.639
look you can't be convinced and

6720.48 --> 6724.638999999999
unless you actually want to right

6724.719 --> 6730.56
some people are just they need a little

6726.96 --> 6730.56
convincing to let it in

6732.0 --> 6737.84
but yeah the the most

6735.44 --> 6739.759999999999
the best long-term results are when

6737.84 --> 6740.88
people come to their own conclusions

6739.76 --> 6742.719
about it
