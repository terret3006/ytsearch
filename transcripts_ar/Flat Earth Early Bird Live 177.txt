39.309 --> 47.629
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.399 --> 50.480000000000004
early-bird number 177 I'm your host

47.629 --> 53.14
Arwen and before we start the show

50.48 --> 55.699
please don't forget to share it and

53.14 --> 57.679
subscribe to my channel if you haven't

55.699 --> 59.059
already and hit the bell notification so

57.679 --> 61.999
you know when I'm going live which

59.059 --> 66.02
usually is 2:00 p.m. amsterdam time

61.999 --> 67.97
every day except sometimes it's just a

66.02 --> 71.53999999999999
little bit early because i get impatient

67.97 --> 74.87
or sometimes it's a little late so hit

71.54 --> 77.45
the bell notification and yeah please

74.87 --> 82.67
support my channel through the super

77.45 --> 85.76
chats paypal patreon and eventually a

82.67 --> 91.52
crypto link or maybe multiple ones i

85.76 --> 97.76
don't know yet and yes welcome so today

91.52 --> 102.19999999999999
is a bit of a dreary day it's not really

97.76 --> 104.81
raining but seems to be like dripping a

102.2 --> 109.64
little bit almost continuously

104.81 --> 113.69
oh yeah the plants I love it it's not

109.64 --> 116.6
really cold it's not very warm either

113.69 --> 120.59
it's just me

116.6 --> 122.58999999999999
and the wind does also blow a little

120.59 --> 127.85000000000001
here and there and that makes it

122.59 --> 131.45
slightly fresh anyway benefi dreary

127.85 --> 133.01
spring day but I'm doing okay good

131.45 --> 135.28
morning everyone let's see who is in

133.01 --> 135.28
chat

135.459 --> 145.55
all right so X xx was there and X xx

141.17 --> 152.86999999999998
confess to be a cooking show fan so he

145.55 --> 157.459
likes food and eating I kind of kind of

152.87 --> 159.65
appreciate cooking things myself but to

157.459 --> 162.5
me it would be highly frustrating if I

159.65 --> 167.12
would then not be able to continually

162.5 --> 168.47
cook to me during this time period like

167.12 --> 171.08
the last five years

168.47 --> 173.09
I don't watch cooking shows when I was

171.08 --> 177.41000000000003
still with my ex oh yeah I did watch it

173.09 --> 180.38
because it was a great adventure we

177.41 --> 183.07999999999998
could try out things I was more willing

180.38 --> 185.66
to try out new things and it was great

183.08 --> 187.64000000000001
fun but now I'm constantly tight budget

185.66 --> 189.549
so it's really frustrating to see like

187.64 --> 193.16
oh my god I really want to try that but

189.549 --> 195.86
yeah that's gonna cost me again oh well

193.16 --> 199.7
Oh next show oh wow I really want to try

195.86 --> 202.19000000000003
that but yeah low budget oh well you

199.7 --> 205.25
know that gets really old really fast so

202.19 --> 214.76
I thought maybe I just avoid that for

205.25 --> 215.42
now hmm right so John Watson hello good

214.76 --> 222.98
afternoon

215.42 --> 226.54899999999998
Lottie says is in early AGM again lots

222.98 --> 233.98899999999998
of talk a game is very talky today yeah

226.549 --> 235.73000000000002
glass Shaw good morning quite switched

233.989 --> 240.01
it's really annoying

235.73 --> 240.01
okay Steve Rand M

240.12 --> 247.81900000000002
/ Mukul stats Moretz Robert Casillas

248.48 --> 256.53
yeah

249.84 --> 262.46
let's see you all so yeah yesterday's

256.53 --> 272.15999999999997
debate was what's good energy was good

262.46 --> 274.38
and I got plenty of room and what was it

272.16 --> 278.45000000000005
about and gas pressure oh yeah I even

274.38 --> 278.45
made a little improvised drawing a

281.419 --> 295.59
demonstration of how a gas pressure come

292.77 --> 297.84
come any within a container could be

295.59 --> 301.38
several tip different types of gas that

297.84 --> 305.07
don't mix just like the bag in the

301.38 --> 307.55
liquid thing that Riley loves so much so

305.07 --> 312.71999999999997
here it's just gas with a clear gradient

307.55 --> 315.87
it could be measurable and yeah outside

312.72 --> 317.40000000000003
it's stacked in a vacuum chamber so

315.87 --> 320.91
that's why it's completely black

317.4 --> 323.92999999999995
there's the some kind of color actually

320.91 --> 326.99
indigo hold on let me extra light this

323.93 --> 328.38
[Music]

326.99 --> 332.12
stat lamp

328.38 --> 332.12
aiming what

332.52 --> 339.60999999999996
okay I don't know what right I don't

337.389 --> 343.36
know why but this light is not helping a

339.61 --> 349.41900000000004
lot it's pointing straight at it oh well

343.36 --> 353.11
anyway stripes or filled-in is basically

349.419 --> 356.71
yeah and so coloring especially the

353.11 --> 358.90000000000003
strong one means solid matter or the

356.71 --> 360.669
density of the matter so the thickness

358.9 --> 363.93899999999996
of the pencil basically indicates the

360.669 --> 365.62
thickness of the density and yeah it's

363.939 --> 368.31
in the vacuum chamber with a lock on it

365.62 --> 370.84000000000003
that's the round thing in the middle and

368.31 --> 373.99
on the other side the lock is released

370.84 --> 376.65
and then yeah it's not really that great

373.99 --> 378.46000000000004
visibility on camera I should probably

376.65 --> 380.919
do this again

378.46 --> 383.59
in paint or something and then use

380.919 --> 386.62
colors so it's actually visible and

383.59 --> 388.23999999999995
scanning and I ever asked an inversion

386.62 --> 391.06
might be little bit clearer I presented

388.24 --> 395.919
it in the debates but it shows basically

391.06 --> 398.68
that ya gradient forms naturally when it

395.919 --> 401.02
find an equilibrium then you and you

398.68 --> 403.68
open it up to the vacuum chamber and it

401.02 --> 407.08
all immediately disperses all of it and

403.68 --> 409.18
then as soon as an equilibrium within

407.08 --> 412.75
the new container has been found the

409.18 --> 414.969
total another equilibrium sets in any

412.75 --> 417.669
gradient forms with the available gases

414.969 --> 422.56
they all go sit in there consecutive

417.669 --> 427.96
layers order themselves according to the

422.56 --> 431.52
relative density spectrum yeah as it

427.96 --> 431.52
works so

432.18 --> 441.129
yeah just again to emphasize if you want

439.389 --> 443.5
to have gas pressure you start out with

441.129 --> 445.41900000000004
a container then you can have gas

443.5 --> 447.31
pressure and then when the gas pressure

445.419 --> 450.52
has found an equilibrium within the

447.31 --> 453.069
container a gradient will start to form

450.52 --> 456.27
based on the relative density spectrum

453.069 --> 456.27000000000004
within the container

463.62 --> 470.39
yeah that's just a presupposition pater

466.53 --> 472.95
from they with it gravity relies on that

470.39 --> 475.16999999999996
it's actually the other way around

472.95 --> 479.72999999999996
gravity relies on relative density in

475.17 --> 481.98
order to have any viability it's just an

479.73 --> 484.89000000000004
assumption that there is a force

481.98 --> 489.81
disequilibrium field present pushing on

484.89 --> 492.47999999999996
everything comes actively and then

489.81 --> 497.07
starts to wonder after fantasizing and

492.48 --> 501.02000000000004
how that supposedly works out in the

497.07 --> 509.82
suppose it's super giant universe think

501.02 --> 511.95
I'm wrong no I'm not wrong look you can

509.82 --> 514.38
scientifically prove gravity but you can

511.95 --> 515.25
scientifically prove relative density it

514.38 --> 517.53
just works

515.25 --> 521.91
it's really annoying with the relative

517.53 --> 524.1899999999999
parts but a directionality is simply not

521.91 --> 531.36
really irrelevant it's all about the

524.19 --> 533.94
gradient but the function of it what

531.36 --> 537.0
actually causes these the displacement

533.94 --> 538.8000000000001
it is relative density and that's just

537.0 --> 542.13
directly provable according to the

538.8 --> 543.54
scientific method it works you can

542.13 --> 548.64
protest that all day long

543.54 --> 550.5899999999999
it's no use it works but that doesn't

548.64 --> 555.6
mean that it's the end of it in the

550.59 --> 556.98
sense of yeah it won right over gravity

555.6 --> 560.28
gravity doesn't have an independent

556.98 --> 562.04
variable it doesn't it doesn't work it's

560.28 --> 565.43
something else always it's mass

562.04 --> 565.43
variously enough

567.91 --> 573.04
yeah doesn't work gravity doesn't work

571.72 --> 576.88
it's not scientifically provable

573.04 --> 580.06
relative density is thus eat one and you

576.88 --> 582.43
that can never be restored just to be

580.06 --> 586.4499999999999
clear but that doesn't mean that there

582.43 --> 589.6899999999999
aren't other things also going on out

586.45 --> 592.62
there and it is interesting at least

589.69 --> 595.36
like hey what's with the directions

592.62 --> 598.51
directions are not relevant to the

595.36 --> 601.62
relative density theory but it's still

598.51 --> 606.4
interesting because we still experience

601.62 --> 611.05
well a certain orientation of all things

606.4 --> 617.0699999999999
and yeah we deduce directions from that

611.05 --> 620.9699999999999
and it's interesting we want to get that

617.07 --> 626.4300000000001
and yeah so there's more than just

620.97 --> 628.8100000000001
proving the effect that's all I'm saying

626.43 --> 631.42
but yeah gravity really never really

628.81 --> 636.8199999999999
comes into play it's just a deduction

631.42 --> 640.02
based aberration it's really really an

636.82 --> 645.7900000000001
aberration it's just so convenient but

640.02 --> 651.49
it was just roughly constructed on top

645.79 --> 654.79
of a whole set of data and and separate

651.49 --> 656.95
potentially provable experiments and I'm

654.79 --> 659.68
talking about the original gravity it's

656.95 --> 663.3100000000001
just like a tool like hey yeah this you

659.68 --> 665.3499999999999
can kind of formulate it like this and

663.31 --> 668.89
it always fits yeah that's the

665.35 --> 671.9200000000001
aberration it makes it a brilliant tool

668.89 --> 673.78
does it work for say designing

671.92 --> 678.0699999999999
construction purposes as I emphasize

673.78 --> 686.47
every single time but it's not actually

678.07 --> 692.13
real okay it's an aberration miss its

686.47 --> 694.96
mysterious that that happens

692.13 --> 698.04
and it's tough on the mind for a lot of

694.96 --> 700.6
people that there are just these weird

698.04 --> 703.36
elements out there and they're so

700.6 --> 706.65
suggestive in their structure and

703.36 --> 709.39
everything and it just it's not true

706.65 --> 713.74
that's the mind trying to make more

709.39 --> 717.51
sense of it and it just wants everything

713.74 --> 721.69
to fin to fit in a clean as possible

717.51 --> 727.63
structure but that doesn't mean that

721.69 --> 729.73
it's gonna be absolutely real yeah and

727.63 --> 733.93
that's where really the religion comes

729.73 --> 736.8100000000001
in that's the real belief aspect with

733.93 --> 741.55
the heliocentrism and body of science

736.81 --> 742.9799999999999
scientism right so I'm drinking some

741.55 --> 747.39
coffee

742.98 --> 747.39
it's definitely amping me up

752.949 --> 758.99
right gravity isn't gonna go away it's

756.44 --> 762.49
always gonna be that tool I think

758.99 --> 767.12
architects are gonna like oh [ __ ] we can

762.49 --> 769.699
like this formula of gravity is now

767.12 --> 772.1
illegal because that is not real

769.699 --> 777.04
that's ridiculous what they're gonna

772.1 --> 781.48
like fabricate a much more difficult

777.04 --> 785.3
preset relative density based system

781.48 --> 786.8000000000001
like can it be done look a yes if

785.3 --> 789.189
there's a programmer out there that

786.8 --> 793.819
could say like yeah you know what I

789.189 --> 796.129
agree with the the hardcore science from

793.819 --> 799.81
the debates thing and I'm really yeah I

796.129 --> 806.66
like a challenge so I'm gonna take this

799.81 --> 808.43
older architect model simulator program

806.66 --> 811.16
and I'm just going to replace the

808.43 --> 812.75
formula for gravity or at least look

811.16 --> 816.5
into it they probably know about it and

812.75 --> 820.67
then replace it with a relative density

816.5 --> 822.769
system see if that's possible because I

820.67 --> 824.3
get the feeling that that's going to be

822.769 --> 827.3
much more difficult

824.3 --> 831.889
like unnecessarily complicated and then

827.3 --> 834.74
you get with efficiency right so there

831.889 --> 836.569
you go gravity is not gonna go away just

834.74 --> 840.069
because it's not real doesn't mean that

836.569 --> 843.199
it's gonna go away that's what I

840.069 --> 847.55
predicted from the start it's even why I

843.199 --> 853.91
started to defend gravity just to damp

847.55 --> 856.0089999999999
down the allergy because otherwise it's

853.91 --> 858.68
just gonna it's gonna be like an

856.009 --> 861.0500000000001
infection that never goes away if you're

858.68 --> 862.939
gonna be allergic to it and that's not

861.05 --> 865.0889999999999
good that's not good for Flat Earth at

862.939 --> 865.0889999999999
all

866.42 --> 871.88
so even though it doesn't go away

868.4 --> 877.03
doesn't mean it is a provable scientific

871.88 --> 881.3
thing though it is still the aberration

877.03 --> 886.6899999999999
aberration aberration iteration yeah I

881.3 --> 890.51
really definitely tractus the cybernetic

886.69 --> 893.9300000000001
cyber Ness Cybernet asides that word in

890.51 --> 896.93
there because I gotta give it some kind

893.93 --> 902.81
of Daggett designation for in order for

896.93 --> 909.26
people to deal with it and damp down the

902.81 --> 913.43
allergy that's why I chose that word it

909.26 --> 916.55
I could have chosen other things but

913.43 --> 919.1899999999999
yeah apparition and then there's so many

916.55 --> 921.14
other aberrations seems pretty much left

919.19 --> 923.9300000000001
out so it's kind of a safe word that

921.14 --> 925.97
can't accidentally get entangled as

923.93 --> 931.31
you're talking about ghosts or something

925.97 --> 934.3100000000001
or or philosophical technicalities so

931.31 --> 936.4399999999999
yeah that's why I thought aberration it

934.31 --> 943.8399999999999
yeah it does kind of match it does make

936.44 --> 943.84
sense it's it's a figment

944.61 --> 953.999
a ghost anyway so yeah must have

952.589 --> 959.6890000000001
triggered a whole lot of people with

953.999 --> 959.6890000000001
this welcome to my channel

960.88 --> 965.87
[Music]

970.59 --> 982.19
okay there's the white discussion going

972.84 --> 982.19
on I need to look into this all right

987.61 --> 997.21
all right clean that's thanks yeah

990.22 --> 1001.7900000000001
that's Newtonian laws right well the

997.21 --> 1001.7900000000001
thing is Newtonian laws are almost more

1002.87 --> 1012.96
they're very mechanical laws so there is

1009.8 --> 1016.3499999999999
there is no absolute guarantee that it

1012.96 --> 1020.13
must always work but I've always learned

1016.35 --> 1023.6700000000001
to trust it and so I said that's why I

1020.13 --> 1027.93
even I adapted it to Newtonian mechanics

1023.67 --> 1032.69
in my discussion with John and everyone

1027.93 --> 1036.8300000000002
and Riley and that is that yes

1032.69 --> 1040.5
displacement displacement caused by

1036.83 --> 1044.55
density being in this equilibrium point

1040.5 --> 1051.06
in relation yeah to the rest of all

1044.55 --> 1054.54
matter that displacement it does yeah by

1051.06 --> 1056.34
to acceleration even if it go is going

1054.54 --> 1059.61
in another direction in the opposite

1056.34 --> 1062.1599999999999
direction even if it is low density in a

1059.61 --> 1065.52
high density area it from a standstill

1062.16 --> 1069.3600000000001
point it will go in an accelerate

1065.52 --> 1075.06
accelerate or efashion so yeah I suggest

1069.36 --> 1078.12
it's basically I don't know it's just a

1075.06 --> 1080.1299999999999
simple trick really tricky it's it's not

1078.12 --> 1083.7299999999998
even a trick it's just trying to fix it

1080.13 --> 1088.1100000000001
like okay there is force going on but

1083.73 --> 1091.17
it's caused by relative density dis

1088.11 --> 1093.1999999999998
equilibrium and it's really fascinating

1091.17 --> 1096.24
because then you can even mathematically

1093.2 --> 1098.49
compare it and try to do that was much

1096.24 --> 1099.18
appreciated on the debates but I'm gonna

1098.49 --> 1103.77
do it here

1099.18 --> 1107.5800000000002
so yeah relative density dis equilibrium

1103.77 --> 1111.03
it's specifically in a state of mobile

1107.58 --> 1114.6799999999998
of mobility must be mobile must be able

1111.03 --> 1118.2
to maneuver within the medium in a state

1114.68 --> 1125.3400000000001
relative density equilibrium

1118.2 --> 1127.49
causes force this equilibrium there you

1125.34 --> 1127.49
go

1132.46 --> 1136.3790000000001
you got your mathematical fix

1137.33 --> 1140.49
[Music]

1149.95 --> 1153.499
[Music]

1159.76 --> 1167.34
oh they really don't like it when their

1163.96 --> 1170.89
actual knowledge is being updated

1167.34 --> 1173.02
because she just want the old thing you

1170.89 --> 1175.0
want the old thing that's what's in the

1173.02 --> 1176.95
books it's so difficult if you suddenly

1175.0 --> 1181.21
have to discard the things you read in

1176.95 --> 1183.73
the box so difficult cuz you did yours

1181.21 --> 1186.28
you'd you've sacrificed so much learning

1183.73 --> 1188.29
all the stuff from the books basically

1186.28 --> 1193.21
brainwashed yourself just to get it all

1188.29 --> 1199.1499999999999
in there to get the grades and you don't

1193.21 --> 1203.89
like to to let that unravel and replace

1199.15 --> 1207.0400000000002
it it's it's kind of like knowledge

1203.89 --> 1211.5700000000002
hoarding you ever fruit you've refused

1207.04 --> 1214.42
to let old [ __ ] go away you refuse to

1211.57 --> 1216.9099999999999
throw it in garbage can because you read

1214.42 --> 1221.5800000000002
it once you learn it once it's like my

1216.91 --> 1224.44
tits it's knowledge hoarding okay or

1221.58 --> 1231.73
data hoard it's not knowledge it's data

1224.44 --> 1234.01
hoarding it's really funny because I

1231.73 --> 1236.23
knew people especially in the old days

1234.01 --> 1239.26
where people would be data hoarding

1236.23 --> 1241.18
especially even just get as much data as

1239.26 --> 1247.42
possible like almost like it could get

1241.18 --> 1249.64
lost somehow and I think that a lot of

1247.42 --> 1252.19
people especially on the baller sites

1249.64 --> 1254.3500000000001
have this purely mental they're just so

1252.19 --> 1257.53
proud that they know so much that they

1254.35 --> 1262.78
learn all the details they lost their

1257.53 --> 1266.01
flexibility they just can they can't

1262.78 --> 1266.01
discard it anymore they can

1267.61 --> 1269.9099999999999
yeah

1283.909 --> 1286.5390000000002
Wow

1286.94 --> 1290.3790000000001
ah such spite

1296.38 --> 1302.4
every day yeah ruffled some feathers I

1300.13 --> 1302.4
think

1307.07 --> 1320.48
ah oh really Samus it's a homogeneous

1312.53 --> 1324.41
mixture of gases right right I I highly

1320.48 --> 1328.73
doubt it highly highly doubt it I think

1324.41 --> 1331.8500000000001
that's even officially not true so Thank

1328.73 --> 1337.49
You Theo Megawati for the $2 super chat

1331.85 --> 1341.8999999999999
donation again gravity is a directional

1337.49 --> 1345.86
not omnidirectional what you need

1341.9 --> 1347.44
erector oh yeah okay okay well if you're

1345.86 --> 1350.1499999999999
gonna presuppose that there is a

1347.44 --> 1353.3300000000002
constant force disequilibrium present

1350.15 --> 1356.27
which yeah I could definitely presuppose

1353.33 --> 1359.4099999999999
it's very easy to do it's a very easy

1356.27 --> 1363.61
way to go it still works

1359.41 --> 1365.48
sure then I do accept it as

1363.61 --> 1369.32
unidirectional that's the only way I

1365.48 --> 1372.44
accepted that in not omnidirectional not

1369.32 --> 1380.72
matter mass attracting mass that kind of

1372.44 --> 1382.8200000000002
[ __ ] right study agree so yeah thank

1380.72 --> 1385.06
you for the constant superjet donations

1382.82 --> 1393.07
much appreciated the Omega Bertie

1385.06 --> 1394.23
[Music]

1393.07 --> 1398.299
yeah

1394.23 --> 1398.299
[Music]

1406.67 --> 1416.6000000000001
I house they don't get cheeky with me I

1411.04 --> 1421.1299999999999
am NOT slick I actually presuppose

1416.6 --> 1424.2199999999998
things I am very I am exactly the

1421.13 --> 1426.8000000000002
opposite of slick but maybe the only

1424.22 --> 1434.18
thing that we do share is that we do

1426.8 --> 1437.53
kind of like to talk but yeah it's not

1434.18 --> 1437.53
like we're the only ones you know

1448.14 --> 1458.13
no but samus that is just officially

1451.98 --> 1463.08
wrong in even in higher atmosphere there

1458.13 --> 1467.1000000000001
is helium there is hydrogen much more

1463.08 --> 1468.78
much much much more than low down so

1467.1 --> 1471.6
you're just completely wrong with this

1468.78 --> 1476.33
is ridiculous it's not a homogeneous

1471.6 --> 1481.53
mass it may be yeah intermixed somewhat

1476.33 --> 1485.07
from layer to layer but eventually yeah

1481.53 --> 1488.25
there will be no more intermixing it

1485.07 --> 1493.9399999999998
will percentage down because it's still

1488.25 --> 1497.58
far away from its relative density level

1493.94 --> 1503.0700000000002
so it is not homogeneous it's not all

1497.58 --> 1507.5
completely mixed in it's not true the

1503.07 --> 1507.5
really heavy gases don't go up there

1511.429 --> 1517.239
like unless in extremely turbulent

1513.919 --> 1519.6490000000001
situations when relative dense when a

1517.239 --> 1521.57
gradient cannot set in yet

1519.649 --> 1524.4499999999998
because there is severe turbulence you

1521.57 --> 1526.46
have to understand that though that's

1524.45 --> 1528.969
another factor at play in the in the

1526.46 --> 1528.969
open world

1543.87 --> 1549.54
were you

1545.94 --> 1557.97
okay Sam as well since I just argued

1549.54 --> 1560.1599999999999
that as long as there's still turbulence

1557.97 --> 1562.02
going on and one could pretty much

1560.16 --> 1566.16
assume that there is always turbulence

1562.02 --> 1569.1299999999999
going on in the world then maybe there's

1566.16 --> 1572.49
always a level of mix-up because of this

1569.13 --> 1574.6200000000001
but theorizing that suddenly there would

1572.49 --> 1577.1
be no more storms for like a week in the

1574.62 --> 1580.7399999999998
entire world no more wind anywhere oh

1577.1 --> 1587.1899999999998
yeah it will definitely start to divide

1580.74 --> 1589.65
then if yeah you get that right there

1587.19 --> 1592.14
may be some mixing in but I highly doubt

1589.65 --> 1596.7
it I think that really high up there it

1592.14 --> 1598.91
it's not the same mixture I don't think

1596.7 --> 1598.91
so

1602.16 --> 1606.18
there's the lower pressure of course but

1604.29 --> 1627.87
it's also a different type of gas

1606.18 --> 1632.28
composition anyway man

1627.87 --> 1635.04
I've noticed that my tea can makes a lot

1632.28 --> 1636.78
of noise handling it that's really

1635.04 --> 1641.97
annoying it didn't do that with my old

1636.78 --> 1644.22
mic but yeah again to get around that

1641.97 --> 1646.88
I'd need a separate standard to put this

1644.22 --> 1651.23
mic in that's not attached to the table

1646.88 --> 1653.3100000000002
so yeah that's gonna cost so

1651.23 --> 1655.97
unfortunately I have to be careful with

1653.31 --> 1655.97
my teapot

1667.489 --> 1678.82
a mouse Matt hmm for my teapot hmm

1674.719 --> 1683.929
that's that's not a really bad idea even

1678.82 --> 1686.029
yeah something like that but I don't

1683.929 --> 1689.45
know it's it's also just kind of heavy

1686.029 --> 1691.909
and the heaviness yeah even if you would

1689.45 --> 1694.519
put it down on something else tends to

1691.909 --> 1702.8300000000002
kind of shake the table and that's

1694.519 --> 1706.039
really vibrated back into the mic okay

1702.83 --> 1714.58
my chair is really vibrant questions

1706.039 --> 1714.58
questions chocolate can't be

1720.35 --> 1729.3799999999999
all right so kx3 20 has a question and

1725.0 --> 1733.639
then that question is not really a

1729.38 --> 1737.47
question it's a rhetorical question and

1733.639 --> 1737.4699999999998
it's really annoying when people do that

1746.83 --> 1754.98
Douce terraces yeah yeah John Smith

1751.899 --> 1754.9799999999998
makes sense

1758.97 --> 1767.64
yeah John Smith said do you know that

1764.82 --> 1769.8
when airplanes airplane cruising

1767.64 --> 1771.48
altitude is reached airplanes fly faster

1769.8 --> 1777.51
because of reduced air resistance yeah

1771.48 --> 1782.15
well that makes perfect sense if they

1777.51 --> 1782.15
were specifically built to do that

1790.6 --> 1796.559
it just supports that there is a

1792.73 --> 1796.559
gradient and I agree to that

1804.67 --> 1807.809
[Music]

1823.47 --> 1827.45
a weird question Brennan cook

1836.11 --> 1846.1399999999999
all right um okay this is definitely

1840.08 --> 1848.62
slowing down um let's see what else did

1846.14 --> 1848.6200000000001
i do yesterday

1855.389 --> 1866.639
I think I watched that quite a lot of

1857.309 --> 1867.1789999999999
Alex Jones I didn't know him yeah it's

1866.639 --> 1871.0089999999998
weird

1867.179 --> 1874.289
there was a piece life recorded and

1871.009 --> 1876.1490000000001
something something happened to Alex

1874.289 --> 1880.23
Jones or something is happening to him

1876.149 --> 1887.9699999999998
because the way he was looking out of

1880.23 --> 1891.509
his eyes it it showed like he was under

1887.97 --> 1895.619
pressure and he was trying to keep it

1891.509 --> 1901.71
under like there's something bad going

1895.619 --> 1904.4399999999998
on like and I think like I think he may

1901.71 --> 1911.7
be really in financial trouble now like

1904.44 --> 1916.0800000000002
very seriously so and that kind of

1911.7 --> 1918.44
saddens me because you have had a knife

1916.08 --> 1921.539
in the past at least I've had great

1918.44 --> 1925.6190000000001
great learning moments thanks to Alex

1921.539 --> 1929.309
Jones and to his crew people like Mike

1925.619 --> 1931.08
Adams it was also part of the the crew

1929.309 --> 1934.44
kind of it comes back every now and then

1931.08 --> 1937.85
like friends worked together sometimes

1934.44 --> 1943.6490000000001
in in the back I think with the the

1937.85 --> 1950.2489999999998
thematic yeah with the supplement things

1943.649 --> 1957.09
and data so I learned so much but yeah

1950.249 --> 1959.34
he's just he's been Wow as Owen Benjamin

1957.09 --> 1961.6999999999998
puts it he's been shilling like he's

1959.34 --> 1965.869
like really getting into political

1961.7 --> 1965.8690000000001
Schilling in and

1967.71 --> 1973.23
it's so weird because sometimes he like

1970.17 --> 1976.01
takes a step back and then just gets

1973.23 --> 1979.64
really criticizing on Trump and he even

1976.01 --> 1983.31
get pretty far sometimes like really

1979.64 --> 1987.18
yeah going totally trying to embarrass

1983.31 --> 1989.61
him him him like really serious and like

1987.18 --> 1992.8500000000001
okay are you are you what are you doing

1989.61 --> 1995.3999999999999
is that are you gonna go do this now and

1992.85 --> 1998.1899999999998
then eventually it just turns back so

1995.4 --> 1999.7800000000002
it's almost like he exaggerates more and

1998.19 --> 2003.71
more it becomes more obvious that he

1999.78 --> 2008.98
exaggerates things and of course in

2003.71 --> 2008.98
retrospect originally he was really like

2009.67 --> 2012.95
freaking people out

2011.57 --> 2015.53
like really grabbing their attention

2012.95 --> 2020.15
waking them from a slumber because so

2015.53 --> 2025.28
many more people 10 15 years ago were in

2020.15 --> 2029.3300000000002
a complete slumber concerning the world

2025.28 --> 2033.04
what was going on and he woke people up

2029.33 --> 2041.48
so many of them because he was like

2033.04 --> 2044.69
saying it in a condensed way that it's

2041.48 --> 2046.97
like Pinkert still absolutely

2044.69 --> 2050.4500000000003
foundationally true but just said in a

2046.97 --> 2055.2200000000003
way that it's more impressive it's kind

2050.45 --> 2056.72
of wizardry but very light it's still

2055.22 --> 2058.4289999999996
it's kind of good with it when you would

2056.72 --> 2063.35
say yeah like I agree to that

2058.429 --> 2065.54
but yeah in retrospect of course looking

2063.35 --> 2069.08
back it seems like okay yes a lot of

2065.54 --> 2072.77
things were kind of like potentially

2069.08 --> 2074.45
true and still are like in the

2072.77 --> 2076.5099999999998
background it there's definitely

2074.45 --> 2081.71
conspiracy conspiracy going on

2076.51 --> 2084.32
absolutely but it's not always so

2081.71 --> 2086.54
immediate so he really does kind of I

2084.32 --> 2089.27
have amp up the fear and he keeps on

2086.54 --> 2092.5099999999998
doing that and it's more obvious and it

2089.27 --> 2094.7
kind of yeah the momentum is kind of

2092.51 --> 2097.8500000000004
lost off of the type of impact he could

2094.7 --> 2101.4399999999996
make because a lot of people are awake

2097.85 --> 2107.75
or defended against awakening

2101.44 --> 2110.42
on the other side so he's kind of like

2107.75 --> 2115.55
the function seems to be almost like

2110.42 --> 2120.13
growing old in the culture it saddens me

2115.55 --> 2126.8500000000004
because he is still a great funny guy he

2120.13 --> 2130.9700000000003
is yeah a comedic artist sometimes and

2126.85 --> 2135.95
he's not super brilliant but he is

2130.97 --> 2141.23
really he he puts everything into it

2135.95 --> 2142.79
he's all in he really is but when it

2141.23 --> 2144.92
comes to the narrative he's become very

2142.79 --> 2147.83
politicized and he seems to be just

2144.92 --> 2150.38
juggling with priorities it's probably

2147.83 --> 2152.72
he got into it and now he's figuring out

2150.38 --> 2154.61
yeah it really is like chaos it's almost

2152.72 --> 2158.9599999999996
antenna below what is he going to do

2154.61 --> 2161.2400000000002
next it and it's probably draining on

2158.96 --> 2164.36
him and kind of sad about it and yeah

2161.24 --> 2166.7299999999996
being severely attacked censored by

2164.36 --> 2171.02
Facebook especially for as a reference

2166.73 --> 2173.77
that it's kind of sad and Facebook is

2171.02 --> 2178.04
just going it's freaky

2173.77 --> 2181.7
they are almost becoming like a cult or

2178.04 --> 2187.49
at least that's what the the owner is

2181.7 --> 2190.49
trying to make it into right and of

2187.49 --> 2193.04
course Alex Jones oh all the thingies or

2190.49 --> 2195.77
everything about him oh my god

2193.04 --> 2198.32
look I'm pretty certain that he's

2195.77 --> 2203.09
probably at the root of most of the

2198.32 --> 2206.02
conspiracies about him because as soon

2203.09 --> 2208.13
as somebody would say something silly

2206.02 --> 2211.0099999999998
something that would kind of stick like

2208.13 --> 2214.85
be like oh my god really then he would

2211.01 --> 2217.9700000000003
as a joke on live on air put that out he

2214.85 --> 2219.98
wanted people to make funny and crazy

2217.97 --> 2222.89
conspiracies about him as long as he

2219.98 --> 2228.869
wouldn't be evil necessary so he kind of

2222.89 --> 2231.52
wanted that it's part of his strategy

2228.869 --> 2236.92
it's part of the visibility of trying to

2231.52 --> 2244.66
stick the mind it's yeah it's

2236.92 --> 2246.88
fascinating so yeah maybe he is Bill

2244.66 --> 2251.71
Hicks I kind of doubt it but I did kind

2246.88 --> 2253.569
of see dental I did on the fly no dental

2251.71 --> 2254.77
records but on just comparing the

2253.569 --> 2258.849
pictures yeah

2254.77 --> 2265.569
then dental works seemed very much like

2258.849 --> 2270.069
the same that's was weird but to me

2265.569 --> 2273.04
really yeah it is sneaky if it was real

2270.069 --> 2278.5299999999997
but I'm just looking at what he's doing

2273.04 --> 2281.109
and where he's going and he seems to be

2278.53 --> 2285.0400000000004
just trying to improvise more and more

2281.109 --> 2287.8489999999997
now and I know all kinds of things could

2285.04 --> 2287.849
come out of this

2291.22 --> 2297.609
and I think at least hey every

2295.39 --> 2299.71
experience I've had with supplements

2297.609 --> 2309.5789999999997
that I ordered in the info war store are

2299.71 --> 2311.5
just really good yeah I didn't try

2309.579 --> 2313.21
everything though yet like I still have

2311.5 --> 2314.8
a bottle of rainforest and I have never

2313.21 --> 2321.01
tried it's the first thing I ordered

2314.8 --> 2323.05
because I had strict vision I had

2321.01 --> 2325.51
visions about that very early on I told

2323.05 --> 2329.7400000000002
I even shared that life that in my

2325.51 --> 2336.28
vision in 97 I remember that supplement

2329.74 --> 2338.02
I knew it was that or maybe the original

2336.28 --> 2341.349
that I did don't even have the original

2338.02 --> 2343.03
I did so it that was really freaky when

2341.349 --> 2345.42
I certainly learned Alex Jones was

2343.03 --> 2349.48
selling this stuff I knew it was that

2345.42 --> 2351.099
just I knew it and so as soon as I

2349.48 --> 2353.23
learned it I got one of these but I've

2351.099 --> 2355.69
always been like very nervous to take it

2353.23 --> 2358.81
because when I did that I was very

2355.69 --> 2363.19
tortured by all the revelations of my

2358.81 --> 2365.68
visions coming back to me yeah been

2363.19 --> 2369.9700000000003
going through quite some things in the

2365.68 --> 2371.859
last five years and last two years is

2369.97 --> 2374.8289999999997
much more talent it has been much more

2371.859 --> 2379.109
tenable and yeah I think that the last

2374.829 --> 2383.73
half year especially it's been I feel

2379.109 --> 2383.73
restored really I think

2383.93 --> 2386.5589999999997
yeah

2389.21 --> 2395.52
but I'm still curious I kind of want to

2392.309 --> 2399.5690000000004
try it sometime but I'm almost nervous

2395.52 --> 2401.52
that it'll give me such ability that

2399.569 --> 2404.579
I'll find myself in a place where I

2401.52 --> 2407.609
simply get frustrated or that I'm locked

2404.579 --> 2409.8900000000003
in through my inability to actually

2407.609 --> 2414.42
apply the skill that becomes available

2409.89 --> 2416.7599999999998
to me by this substance and that would

2414.42 --> 2419.46
be very painful because I knew like oh

2416.76 --> 2423.51
my god if I would be in certain setup I

2419.46 --> 2426.03
could do incredible things now I just

2423.51 --> 2427.1400000000003
know I could like for example maybe I

2426.03 --> 2429.9
don't know exactly what's gonna happen

2427.14 --> 2435.75
but depending on my focus I could be

2429.9 --> 2439.64
incredibly convincing or really really

2435.75 --> 2442.349
clear in my thinking really sharp and

2439.64 --> 2444.8089999999997
get much maybe I'll get much more

2442.349 --> 2450.119
oversight over the workings of things

2444.809 --> 2452.6400000000003
and instead of just yeah kind of

2450.119 --> 2455.309
grabbing out of sight and pretty much

2452.64 --> 2457.5589999999997
getting it right I literally could see

2455.309 --> 2460.02
everything simultaneously maybe maybe

2457.559 --> 2463.289
that'll happen I don't know I expect

2460.02 --> 2468.21
something pretty impressive to happen to

2463.289 --> 2471.65
me if I take this really but that's why

2468.21 --> 2475.349
I've not done it and if I do it then

2471.65 --> 2477.9
there must be a special day like really

2475.349 --> 2479.67
something where I am gonna like

2477.9 --> 2483.14
construct something that has to be like

2479.67 --> 2487.77
incredibly perfect or something or a

2483.14 --> 2490.49
grand project of some kind that's kind

2487.77 --> 2490.49
of what I'm waiting for

2496.32 --> 2508.02
so yeah that's a little bit about Alex

2500.28 --> 2510.4700000000003
Jones and his supplements so politics is

2508.02 --> 2513.63
just a giant mess

2510.47 --> 2516.33
everybody's like every group now in the

2513.63 --> 2519.27
world pretty much has a total [ __ ] fest

2516.33 --> 2521.7799999999997
going on one way or the other and each

2519.27 --> 2524.22
one of them are like pointing fingers

2521.78 --> 2526.0800000000004
towards the other groups like oh that's

2524.22 --> 2529.77
all they're doing and like yeah in a

2526.08 --> 2534.66
sense every group is trying to mess with

2529.77 --> 2537.39
all other groups so they're always

2534.66 --> 2538.8599999999997
pointing at each other and yeah it might

2537.39 --> 2541.17
not be at the thing they're literally

2538.86 --> 2545.79
pointing at but there will definitely be

2541.17 --> 2553.25
some kind of opposition just friction

2545.79 --> 2556.41
going on this it's it's really annoying

2553.25 --> 2563.97
well maybe it's not I don't know as long

2556.41 --> 2566.79
as there's just no songs there's no real

2563.97 --> 2570.87
serious damage going on of course there

2566.79 --> 2573.3
are still the ongoing wars going on like

2570.87 --> 2575.46
for example the terrible situation in

2573.3 --> 2576.03
Yemen that's still going on and oh my

2575.46 --> 2578.85
god

2576.03 --> 2583.77
Reid I think recently now again Israel

2578.85 --> 2586.08
is starting to strike Gaza again I've

2583.77 --> 2590.73
seen some things on RT about that so

2586.08 --> 2594.42
again and that all that kind of thing

2590.73 --> 2599.67
just keeps on going on and they're all

2594.42 --> 2604.02
kind of everybody is involving them in

2599.67 --> 2610.5
some kind of bad situation somehow every

2604.02 --> 2615.119
big party they're all doing it it's not

2610.5 --> 2617.31
it's not good but it they really it is

2615.119 --> 2619.4700000000003
almost like Game of Thrones mentality so

2617.31 --> 2623.19
they kind of like okay this is terrible

2619.47 --> 2625.22
but if we don't do it then we don't get

2623.19 --> 2628.65
something out of it and some other

2625.22 --> 2629.5499999999997
opponent will take its place and get the

2628.65 --> 2636.0
advantage

2629.55 --> 2639.69
it's very robotic and exploitive and how

2636.0 --> 2642.359
it's starting to work or it kind of

2639.69 --> 2644.66
guess it has been working like that for

2642.359 --> 2644.66
a while

2656.26 --> 2665.19
anyway there's no that's going anywhere

2660.99 --> 2665.1899999999996
you guys are not even paying attention

2687.48 --> 2690.48
okay

2691.63 --> 2694.809
[Music]

2697.78 --> 2706.449
so let's see that's gonna talk about

2703.09 --> 2706.449
[Music]

2712.28 --> 2717.3190000000004
[Music]

2721.45 --> 2725.3489999999997
ah I don't know guys now yeah we could

2724.69 --> 2727.9
talk

2725.349 --> 2729.67
conspiracy talk about Trump maybe like

2727.9 --> 2733.9300000000003
everybody else is doing it

2729.67 --> 2736.9500000000003
Alex Jones is even doing it I have no

2733.93 --> 2741.1299999999997
problem at this point because I have

2736.95 --> 2743.95
definite questions and there's things

2741.13 --> 2748.65
going on with Trump and he's making

2743.95 --> 2752.47
weird decisions or in decisions and

2748.65 --> 2758.109
there's there's many angles of approach

2752.47 --> 2760.7799999999997
to it what he's doing like ins a lot of

2758.109 --> 2762.67
people just say he's just a puppet he's

2760.78 --> 2766.17
just reading his script

2762.67 --> 2769.71
oh there's a lot of doubt to that though

2766.17 --> 2772.359
people that get more close to him

2769.71 --> 2778.15
there's a lot of people also suggesting

2772.359 --> 2782.17
that he's just mocking up that he's has

2778.15 --> 2786.819
moments of shortsightedness basically or

2782.17 --> 2789.46
that he doesn't get things somehow and

2786.819 --> 2794.23
therefore he takes another priority

2789.46 --> 2796.119
almost slick James Johnson's it as well

2794.23 --> 2800.049
just ignores it and does his own thing

2796.119 --> 2802.4500000000003
in a way which his own method seems to

2800.049 --> 2809.73
be originally at least not meant for

2802.45 --> 2812.5299999999997
politics but very wide is a big planner

2809.73 --> 2814.95
so and he's kind of good at that I think

2812.53 --> 2818.44
it's not like the most excellent

2814.95 --> 2823.0299999999997
miraculously perfect but he's reeling

2818.44 --> 2826.42
vicious at least so there are so many

2823.03 --> 2830.53
ways to approach this like is he just

2826.42 --> 2836.4700000000003
faltering or is he corrupted really to

2830.53 --> 2842.77
some party or is he a total puppet or is

2836.47 --> 2846.0989999999997
he kind of like acting like to the deep

2842.77 --> 2848.2
state like he is like I'm I don't know

2846.099 --> 2849.79
what to do anymore you are so impressing

2848.2 --> 2853.45
me is he just biding his time waiting

2849.79 --> 2855.22
for a certain moment does certainly

2853.45 --> 2859.39
everything is in place

2855.22 --> 2862.0
just Kabang okay it's over now like yeah

2859.39 --> 2864.04
you're all gonna go to jail and we're

2862.0 --> 2868.03
gonna have very rapid trials that are

2864.04 --> 2870.2799999999997
not gonna screw around that kind of

2868.03 --> 2873.099
thing and there's a lot of people kind

2870.28 --> 2875.8590000000004
of like hoping like when is he gonna go

2873.099 --> 2882.54
after Hillary Clinton and the deep state

2875.859 --> 2885.31
and yeah that is kind of weak yeah the

2882.54 --> 2887.08
America at least and probably the world

2885.31 --> 2890.56
I don't know all of the entire

2887.08 --> 2894.04
consequences of it but it is kind of do

2890.56 --> 2896.14
it requires to happen justice needs to

2894.04 --> 2899.02
be met it's too much of a thorn in the

2896.14 --> 2900.67
eye of everything it's just terrible so

2899.02 --> 2902.89
will he do that

2900.67 --> 2905.2000000000003
is he capable of doing that or is he

2902.89 --> 2907.27
just literally incapable of doing it and

2905.2 --> 2913.1499999999996
he is faltering this is kind of a

2907.27 --> 2916.54
mystery and he is he does act even as

2913.15 --> 2919.9300000000003
part of his strategies there is the

2916.54 --> 2922.83
mystery with him he did it on his game

2919.93 --> 2925.48
shows and he's kind of straightforward

2922.83 --> 2929.5
until things get more complicated and

2925.48 --> 2930.609
then he can just then it the

2929.5 --> 2933.82
straightforward girl

2930.609 --> 2940.089
this started starts to turn in an arrow

2933.82 --> 2942.55
a narrative thing but it's you can he is

2940.089 --> 2947.44
very well-tailored you can't distinguish

2942.55 --> 2950.8
it so you don't know that's one of his

2947.44 --> 2956.53
massive tricks it's one of his grand

2950.8 --> 2958.3590000000004
talents I think that's what I think does

2956.53 --> 2960.9700000000003
it mean that he is a freaking genius it

2958.359 --> 2963.2799999999997
just means that he has this skill in

2960.97 --> 2966.91
this system and what he does and it's

2963.28 --> 2969.6400000000003
just any kind of it it can have

2966.91 --> 2973.68
miraculous results and it definitely

2969.64 --> 2976.69
makes things more in unpredictable so

2973.68 --> 2980.89
who knows yeah that's my conspiracy

2976.69 --> 2983.4700000000003
theorizing about Trump all hope is not

2980.89 --> 2986.6189999999997
necessarily lost but yeah he's certainly

2983.47 --> 2990.6299999999997
doing some things that are not great the

2986.619 --> 2990.63
vaccination issues are terrible

2992.07 --> 3000.9
and the yeah gun controlled censorship

2998.77 --> 3003.59
is not he's just letting it all happened

3000.9 --> 3006.87
that's just that is terrible

3003.59 --> 3010.02
so there's many problems he had more

3006.87 --> 3014.04
issues with Yemen still letting it

3010.02 --> 3021.66
happen arms deals and things and so

3014.04 --> 3025.38
there's a lot of problems but yeah look

3021.66 --> 3031.56
a president can't just he didn't get the

3025.38 --> 3033.4500000000003
entire machine with him like the

3031.56 --> 3038.19
Democrats did they had everything in

3033.45 --> 3040.3799999999997
place almost everything so Obama just

3038.19 --> 3043.2000000000003
had it easy he could just lay it out and

3040.38 --> 3045.87
everybody would work along with it well

3043.2 --> 3048.3199999999997
Trump he might have been much better but

3045.87 --> 3050.7599999999998
he just doesn't have that support

3048.32 --> 3052.77
structure underneath him to allow that

3050.76 --> 3055.7700000000004
to be as good as it could be

3052.77 --> 3058.92
it's very sad in that doesn't mean that

3055.77 --> 3061.65
he will never be able to do anything but

3058.92 --> 3065.73
he's still just mostly trying to go

3061.65 --> 3068.1600000000003
along not to destabilize things too much

3065.73 --> 3069.87
he can do a total governmental

3068.16 --> 3074.16
transformation he doesn't have the

3069.87 --> 3077.5699999999997
support for that to really like

3074.16 --> 3084.5099999999998
reconstitution Eliza everything that's

3077.57 --> 3086.7000000000003
can't happen yet I think maybe I'm wrong

3084.51 --> 3089.88
maybe that is also part of what is

3086.7 --> 3093.83
getting in place again I don't know I am

3089.88 --> 3097.19
not even American so this is all just

3093.83 --> 3097.19
conspiracy theorizing

3121.7 --> 3128.7
right for in each well sorry but there

3125.04 --> 3131.88
are just subjects that I study out there

3128.7 --> 3135.0899999999997
that I'd like to address and I'm sorry

3131.88 --> 3139.83
that everybody hates all these things so

3135.09 --> 3141.9900000000002
much if that's supposedly the case I am

3139.83 --> 3145.64
interested in it and I think it's

3141.99 --> 3149.0699999999997
important I think that my interest and

3145.64 --> 3154.92
the importance of the investment in

3149.07 --> 3161.4300000000003
looking there it supersedes yeah

3154.92 --> 3165.14
popularity for me okay I think it's just

3161.43 --> 3165.14
important to know about this stuff

3168.66 --> 3175.68
right okay grab it heart asks it I think

3172.77 --> 3178.14
technically judicial question what does

3175.68 --> 3183.12
the you met us mean to you the us I

3178.14 --> 3185.72
think stands specifically for the for

3183.12 --> 3185.72
the federal government

3189.78 --> 3197.78
where the USA stands for the literally

3193.38 --> 3197.78
United States of America

3204.9 --> 3213.4700000000003
that's what I got from hearing all that

3209.39 --> 3213.47
through Alex Jones too

3216.15 --> 3218.96
yeah

3220.99 --> 3232.1
Karen B that's that's all relative

3227.08 --> 3234.14
really look it is all knowledge these

3232.1 --> 3239.0299999999997
things are there but yeah their things

3234.14 --> 3242.27
are exaggerated to spare people and dumb

3239.03 --> 3245.6000000000004
people do also tend to respond to it and

3242.27 --> 3248.36
then it's probably not that great a

3245.6 --> 3253.1
result but that doesn't mean that you

3248.36 --> 3256.58
should just ignore all of it I don't do

3253.1 --> 3259.25
that only when the people that are

3256.58 --> 3262.94
presenting are just just too unbearable

3259.25 --> 3267.5
for me so yeah I'd never be able to like

3262.94 --> 3269.7200000000003
watch CNN like I can every time a clip

3267.5 --> 3272.9
of it is brought up somewhere I can

3269.72 --> 3281.39
barely even watch that it's so annoying

3272.9 --> 3284.11
it's so repulsive but to eat it

3281.39 --> 3284.1099999999997
their own I think

3289.87 --> 3293.06
[Music]

3298.02 --> 3306.15
no loken 16 I definitely do not think

3300.809 --> 3308.6090000000004
that the EU is good for Europe I think

3306.15 --> 3311.579
that the original EU trade agreement

3308.609 --> 3314.25
system was good for Europe and then they

3311.579 --> 3320.1600000000003
just decided to subtly make some kind of

3314.25 --> 3324.69
weird and accountable federal government

3320.16 --> 3328.5299999999997
out of it subtly in Brussels and that

3324.69 --> 3332.579
was not the original plan and I don't

3328.53 --> 3338.039
like I never liked that and their being

3332.579 --> 3342.1800000000003
reckless and it's just I don't like it

3338.039 --> 3345.03
at all I like the original trade

3342.18 --> 3347.569
agreement that was kind of that was okay

3345.03 --> 3347.5690000000004
at least

3354.76 --> 3362.3590000000004
so well yeah one comes to Europe I don't

3358.94 --> 3364.94
like the way it is right now but who

3362.359 --> 3373.46
knows maybe in some way there could be a

3364.94 --> 3377.089
more sensible Europe that is well more

3373.46 --> 3382.039
accountable and less dominant not

3377.089 --> 3384.44
constantly always making decisions yeah

3382.039 --> 3392.5690000000004
against people's will that yeah actually

3384.44 --> 3396.13
function that doesn't homogenized Europe

3392.569 --> 3399.079
look it should be about financial

3396.13 --> 3400.789
fluidity that that everything that's

3399.079 --> 3403.8390000000004
what the original trade agreement was to

3400.789 --> 3406.94
synchronize things in order to optimize

3403.839 --> 3407.5389999999998
trade and finances and all that that's

3406.94 --> 3409.64
good

3407.539 --> 3415.779
it doesn't mean that everybody should be

3409.64 --> 3418.089
then forced to follow some extra rules

3415.779 --> 3423.98
beside what their own country does

3418.089 --> 3425.599
that's really annoying although you have

3423.98 --> 3428.0
to a certain degree of course like

3425.599 --> 3434.42
countries need to fix their problems of

3428.0 --> 3437.45
course it's anyway what's happening now

3434.42 --> 3443.21
in Europe in the European Parliament ie

3437.45 --> 3447.1299999999997
it's so it's bad the entire atmosphere

3443.21 --> 3447.13
there is also terrible

3455.69 --> 3458.38
yeah

3475.45 --> 3478.3489999999997
all right

3480.59 --> 3485.19
yeah I've heard that John Smith and

3483.48 --> 3488.55
there's definitely something to it it's

3485.19 --> 3494.1
not just America okay Europe also and

3488.55 --> 3498.2400000000002
it's kind of already happened but it was

3494.1 --> 3499.95
I guess sort it's now toning down

3498.24 --> 3502.5
there's like countries that don't do it

3499.95 --> 3505.859
in countries that are kind of like yeah

3502.5 --> 3510.05
we are with you but we kind of have our

3505.859 --> 3513.06
own conceptualization and approach and

3510.05 --> 3514.53
we're not lit yeah we're we're going

3513.06 --> 3516.6
along but we're not doing everything

3514.53 --> 3520.98
that kind of thing so it's not as

3516.6 --> 3522.9
uniform as it could have been then would

3520.98 --> 3524.73
have been over very quickly it would

3522.9 --> 3528.81
have been a mess economy would have been

3524.73 --> 3531.619
trashed very quickly but there's a lot

3528.81 --> 3536.29
of course the yellow vest situation

3531.619 --> 3537.8900000000003
keeps on going especially in France and

3536.29 --> 3540.7799999999997
[Music]

3537.89 --> 3544.41
yeah in the United States the states of

3540.78 --> 3547.26
course it's different because the states

3544.41 --> 3550.23
really do act more like the provinces of

3547.26 --> 3555.1800000000003
that giant country while Europe really

3550.23 --> 3557.609
is just there's definitely the the

3555.18 --> 3561.75
country identities definitely that's

3557.609 --> 3563.7599999999998
it's it's not the same set up so with

3561.75 --> 3567.39
the United States if it's just allowed

3563.76 --> 3570.42
to let in then there's a bigger risk

3567.39 --> 3574.22
that it'll spill over much more even

3570.42 --> 3574.2200000000003
because there's not so many barriers

3579.569 --> 3588.7
it all depends like maybe the states are

3584.559 --> 3592.4500000000003
also getting more divided to watch one

3588.7 --> 3594.64
another politically they're all more be

3592.45 --> 3599.5
probably be more issues with border

3594.64 --> 3602.529
things and you know I don't know it's

3599.5 --> 3607.509
it's super elaborate this subject it's

3602.529 --> 3609.22
not I could never do it the subject

3607.509 --> 3612.549
really justice because it's a very

3609.22 --> 3615.97
elaborate subject but yeah it definitely

3612.549 --> 3618.519
goes on it's immigration mass

3615.97 --> 3621.0389999999998
immigration and not very controlled

3618.519 --> 3625.0
that's the thing it's mass immigration

3621.039 --> 3626.92
is never never you can't really control

3625.0 --> 3629.46
it properly it's very difficult to do

3626.92 --> 3629.46
that's draining

3633.12 --> 3641.6099999999997
look I'm not against immigration but you

3638.7 --> 3647.6299999999997
shouldn't just move entire or let entire

3641.61 --> 3647.63
hordes of people in that's not wise

3656.64 --> 3666.279
anyway yeah I'm gonna round out the show

3661.66 --> 3668.979
we've been going for an hour and I'm

3666.279 --> 3671.079
done talking or probably not done

3668.979 --> 3674.5589999999997
talking but I'm not getting any guests

3671.079 --> 3678.759
