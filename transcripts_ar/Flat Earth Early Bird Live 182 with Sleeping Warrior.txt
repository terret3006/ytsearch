6.62 --> 37.36
[Music]

37.82 --> 45.839
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

41.76 --> 47.73
early-bird number 182 I'm your host

45.839 --> 50.19
Arwen and before we start the show

47.73 --> 54.0
please don't forget to share it on any

50.19 --> 55.92
platform you see fit and if you haven't

54.0 --> 57.57
already subscribed to my channel and hit

55.92 --> 59.309000000000005
about notification so you know when I'm

57.57 --> 64.19
going live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

59.309 --> 68.61
amsterdam time every day so today

64.19 --> 75.72
beautiful day it's kind of weird because

68.61 --> 78.42
they did chemtrail a lot like not even 3

75.72 --> 81.78
hours earlier in the morning there was

78.42 --> 84.03
like a checker board up there but I

81.78 --> 89.22
don't know the wind seemed there's like

84.03 --> 92.7
a constant breeze not super warm but not

89.22 --> 96.179
cold either and it might have dispersed

92.7 --> 98.97
it sort of there's still some hanging

96.179 --> 101.22
over there there's no spraying going on

98.97 --> 103.14
at this time at least like there are

101.22 --> 107.069
some planes but they're not really

103.14 --> 112.289
leaving anything just contrails so I

107.069 --> 114.42
don't know I think I do see that's a

112.289 --> 116.899
little bit less blue than normal like

114.42 --> 121.319
there's a little bit of haziness

116.899 --> 123.979
but still a nice day very sunny very

121.319 --> 123.979
little clouds

125.159 --> 131.70000000000002
I think this would make great beach

127.649 --> 139.019
weather though yeah with that wind would

131.7 --> 142.57999999999998
probably be a little bit cold so anyway

139.019 --> 142.58
yeah hello everyone in chat

143.959 --> 155.61
there's mr. Barr fast my gran thean

149.73 --> 157.73899999999998

155.61 --> 160.769
creator okay weird

163.61 --> 171.81
good morning to you all seems like

167.43 --> 177.66
there's not so many up on a Monday hard

171.81 --> 180.15
to get out of bed probably or maybe

177.66 --> 182.88
people just thought like odd it's

180.15 --> 186.239
beautiful weather I'm gonna like go out

182.88 --> 188.69
and do something out there I wouldn't

186.239 --> 188.69
blame you

190.94 --> 198.48
yeah went for for a bike ride to get

195.39 --> 202.82899999999998
some groceries and it was quite quite

198.48 --> 205.56
nice Pleasant did where they like a

202.829 --> 208.59
jacket and everything because yeah with

205.56 --> 212.12
the winner and it was a lot more cloudy

208.59 --> 212.12
in the morning so

213.54 --> 223.129
but still it's nice day so how are you

216.84 --> 226.98000000000002
all doing they even read ah I got coffee

223.129 --> 229.67999999999998
they're so stupid a lot of times I just

226.98 --> 232.379
make coffee right before the show and

229.68 --> 234.9
then I forget to get it this done not

232.379 --> 237.75
this time be right back

234.9 --> 240.209
oh yeah and I got a hot song Illuminati

237.75 --> 242.76
killer song I kind of talked about

240.209 --> 244.98
before because I was a son warming it

242.76 --> 248.519
when the Sun was still getting inside I

244.98 --> 250.26
put my the plate with it right in the

248.519 --> 251.79
Sun and it was so nice and warm I just

250.26 --> 256.19
couldn't resist but take a bite

251.79 --> 256.19
I'll be back with coffee in a minute

315.21 --> 322.48999999999995
you come back I got coffee

319.45 --> 322.49
[Music]

323.96 --> 331.76
not too much sugar and just a little

326.94 --> 331.76
coffee milk it's the way I like it

332.09 --> 349.53
all organic filtered water especially

338.93 --> 356.01
magnetized with app energizer mmm and

349.53 --> 360.03
really hot so yeah what have I been up

356.01 --> 363.69
to oh yeah I feel the coffee hits

360.03 --> 365.03999999999996
immediately I'm really sensitive to

363.69 --> 367.05
coffee but you gotta be careful because

365.04 --> 370.70000000000005
if I go on it too many times

367.05 --> 375.18
oh my skin just starts to become

370.7 --> 376.71
animated get like severe prickles

375.18 --> 379.62
everywhere like I start to feel

376.71 --> 381.41999999999996
everything like it's trying to draw my

379.62 --> 385.89
attention like hey I'm here I'm here

381.42 --> 387.48
it's like her and I can get itchy so I

385.89 --> 390.81
gotta be careful with coffee not too

387.48 --> 393.3
much but like twice a day

390.81 --> 394.23
it's just doable and I kind of liked

393.3 --> 396.33
having coffee

394.23 --> 397.68
during my hangout now because I do get

396.33 --> 403.26
an immediate pickup that I can

397.68 --> 404.58
absolutely use although yeah in the

403.26 --> 410.03999999999996
future I do also want to try it with

404.58 --> 412.38
brain force but don't want to go there

410.04 --> 417.15000000000003
just yet definitely thinking about it

412.38 --> 419.96
still have to the sealed bottle mmm from

417.15 --> 423.23999999999995
two years ago yeah

419.96 --> 426.81
maybe more anyway I what have I been up

423.24 --> 430.02
to I've been watching a new movie on

426.81 --> 434.94
Netflix that was basically popping in my

430.02 --> 439.85999999999996
face started to play and the well be

434.94 --> 442.11
what is it it was a movie by the Chinese

439.86 --> 444.93
state no less was like immediately

442.11 --> 447.54
apparent this was absolutely Chinese

444.93 --> 452.04
state-sponsored and everything but the

447.54 --> 460.449
CGI holy crap that was so

452.04 --> 464.22
it was a giant CGI orgy and it was it

460.449 --> 469.09000000000003
was very funny and interesting and super

464.22 --> 472.59000000000003
super baller super baller movie it was

469.09 --> 475.17999999999995
absolutely heliocentrism on steroids

472.59 --> 477.34
amazing like it immediately started out

475.18 --> 485.04
about all look teaching a child how it

477.34 --> 486.69
works it's like go on yeah but it was

485.04 --> 490.93
okay

486.69 --> 495.03
the CGI was just absurd and really

490.93 --> 498.729
beautiful but the story was a bit and

495.03 --> 503.83
the characters were kind of stereotype I

498.729 --> 506.71
guess a lot of people would like it and

503.83 --> 508.38
there was some weird Chinese details in

506.71 --> 513.55
there like cultural things like

508.38 --> 516.45
apparently I get the gist the idea that

513.55 --> 518.8199999999999
they don't appreciate half-breeds

516.45 --> 524.38
because there was a character in there

518.82 --> 526.9590000000001
it was like really spunky and I don't

524.38 --> 529.81
know he looked he wasn't almost like gay

526.959 --> 532.5699999999999
but he wasn't really gay but he acted

529.81 --> 535.63
kind of like face and had blond hair and

532.57 --> 537.49
he was half Australian and everybody

535.63 --> 539.95
looked down all at least the Chinese

537.49 --> 542.17
looked down upon him and he was acting

539.95 --> 544.0600000000001
like a punk though so that might have

542.17 --> 548.65
have something to do with it too but

544.06 --> 550.5699999999999
it's very weird that they would have a

548.65 --> 553.06
character like that and even say that

550.57 --> 558.6600000000001
continue like yeah I'm a Hoffa Straley

553.06 --> 562.3299999999999
enough it was awkward for me to see that

558.66 --> 563.5
but I guess that's it normal for the

562.33 --> 567.1600000000001
Chinese so and it was definitely

563.5 --> 569.89
directed at that the other although this

567.16 --> 573.9399999999999
time at least there was English it was

569.89 --> 575.5889999999999
English spoken so I have seen some of

573.94 --> 578.86
these movies before where there was just

575.589 --> 580.9300000000001
it was just all Chinese and you were

578.86 --> 582.97
lucky to even have subtitles I didn't

580.93 --> 585.67
from the things that I downloaded and

582.97 --> 589.33
but that was not that was before Netflix

585.67 --> 593.3399999999999
but this movie it was so silly and but

589.33 --> 597.1800000000001
pretty interesting at the same it's like

593.34 --> 600.9100000000001
it gets really really tightly

597.18 --> 603.8199999999999
presupposed very very tightly and it's

600.91 --> 607.75
got a really almost childish fantasy but

603.82 --> 609.25
with super high-tech stuff it's it's

607.75 --> 611.5
something else I think that a very

609.25 --> 614.47
little kid like a six-year-old that

611.5 --> 617.17
would be interested in space would

614.47 --> 619.03
absolutely be gushing watching this

617.17 --> 625.5899999999999
movie if I had seen this when I was a

619.03 --> 628.0
kid my god I probably might never I

625.59 --> 632.11
would have probably been a lot more

628.0 --> 635.44
resist or I would probably no no I think

632.11 --> 637.57
the same would happen but I anyway it

635.44 --> 639.7600000000001
would just reinforce my love for a space

637.57 --> 641.38
and fantasy and make me draw that kind

639.76 --> 645.01
of [ __ ] I would probably make drawings

641.38 --> 649.45
of this movie back then if I had seen it

645.01 --> 653.56
back then but what it basically was is

649.45 --> 656.5300000000001
yeah the earth seriously it is so so

653.56 --> 659.1999999999999
super presuppositional it's amazing but

656.53 --> 663.6999999999999
what they basically spoilers by the way

659.2 --> 666.4300000000001
if you want to see this movie and on the

663.7 --> 668.86
other hand yeah the the trailer thing

666.43 --> 671.38
they showed it almost completely showed

668.86 --> 673.63
a concentrate of the entire movie which

671.38 --> 675.34
was like very overwhelming even to see

673.63 --> 677.71
it because you can also get glimpses of

675.34 --> 681.1
all the amazing seizure so concentrate

677.71 --> 683.38
and the movie doesn't reveal much new

681.1 --> 687.7900000000001
anyway so if you see that intro thing

683.38 --> 692.68
you you're probably already know most of

687.79 --> 695.05
it so anyway to summarize it what they

692.68 --> 699.52
say is that at some point suddenly the

695.05 --> 704.3199999999999
Sun starts to turn into a red dwarf like

699.52 --> 707.11
it ages and it becomes bigger and it

704.32 --> 710.38
would burn the earth up in like what is

707.11 --> 714.19
it what do they say a hundred years or

710.38 --> 717.1899999999999
something or so what they do yeah the

714.19 --> 719.1300000000001
world government suddenly starts to

717.19 --> 722.62
build

719.13 --> 725.26
planetary engines thrusters everywhere

722.62 --> 727.6
around the world but they do really get

725.26 --> 729.97
the scale thing kind of right it's not

727.6 --> 733.63
like the old transformer like oh we big

729.97 --> 736.6
one big jet engine on Cybertron which

733.63 --> 738.61
was kind of funny back then still really

736.6 --> 740.77
cool conceptualization based on

738.61 --> 742.51
heliocentric thinking but in this movie

740.77 --> 745.54
they built like a lot of them like

742.51 --> 748.75
hundreds and they really got up close

745.54 --> 751.36
and it's like a GI and design structure

748.75 --> 755.35
and the architecture in this movie is

751.36 --> 757.8100000000001
pretty pretty damn impressive there must

755.35 --> 761.71
have been some real architectural geeks

757.81 --> 763.8399999999999
like a lot of them work this definitely

761.71 --> 767.62
could not have been all designed by one

763.84 --> 769.33
man no way no way but it was amazing

767.62 --> 772.39
like the entire CGI everything was

769.33 --> 775.48
amazing but yeah they basically had a

772.39 --> 777.31
plan the wondering earth and then the

775.48 --> 779.77
jet engines would propel the earth

777.31 --> 783.4599999999999
outside of its orbit they would say

779.77 --> 787.11
goodbye to the moon even and try to

783.46 --> 792.0400000000001
leave the solar system to another

787.11 --> 794.71
the closest by Sun would take what they

792.04 --> 797.0799999999999
say like 300 years to get there with the

794.71 --> 798.94
thrusters at maximum at first they

797.08 --> 801.5200000000001
accelerate and then they have to slow

798.94 --> 803.32
down to get in the right position and

801.52 --> 805.63
they have a giant space station it goes

803.32 --> 809.6500000000001
ahead of them like a scouting ship it's

805.63 --> 811.57
so well thought out actually but the

809.65 --> 815.23
story itself is yeah it's still

811.57 --> 817.1500000000001
heliocentrism and then they get into

815.23 --> 818.59
trouble and yeah this would be an

817.15 --> 822.52
enormous spoiler to tell but they

818.59 --> 827.14
literally in the in the concentrate all

822.52 --> 830.71
show that so they are supposedly going

827.14 --> 833.38
around Jupiter taking its gravitational

830.71 --> 835.9300000000001
pull from a certain distance to then

833.38 --> 842.16
slingshot into the right direction very

835.93 --> 842.16
well time to using it

842.38 --> 848.42
orbital mechanics is you and then

846.41 --> 850.4599999999999
something goes wrong because they

848.42 --> 853.52
underestimated the gravitational pull

850.46 --> 857.75
and giant disaster starts happened like

853.52 --> 861.17
that's like oh [ __ ] but still there's AI

857.75 --> 863.24
involved and it's really very smart but

861.17 --> 866.8399999999999
straight to the point and it apparently

863.24 --> 870.61
just has some sort of weird ruling

866.84 --> 874.1600000000001
capability like I don't know it's really

870.61 --> 876.95
very heavy concentrated movie with sight

874.16 --> 879.14
five details that are being worked out

876.95 --> 881.72
by pretty smart people overall there's

879.14 --> 883.91
nothing like really cliched super cliche

881.72 --> 887.12
although there's a lot of recycled

883.91 --> 891.92
material but better thought out more

887.12 --> 894.83
evolved more high-tech ish and yeah so

891.92 --> 896.51
the disaster it is like an

894.83 --> 899.96
end-of-the-world movie after that point

896.51 --> 901.85
in like super earth quakes and yeah and

899.96 --> 903.98
of course also before all that there's

901.85 --> 905.78
like the transition of they were slowly

903.98 --> 907.34
losing his atmosphere and everything

905.78 --> 913.85
becomes frozen and they go underground

907.34 --> 918.7900000000001
in giant bases it is a sci-fi spectacle

913.85 --> 918.7900000000001
really at that but as a movie and they

918.91 --> 926.8399999999999
yeah I've seen worse definitely and it

923.75 --> 930.71
was it was interesting to sit through it

926.84 --> 933.83
so yeah what is it called again what the

930.71 --> 938.24
wondering earth I'm gonna look it up and

933.83 --> 940.49
just make it into a little advertisement

938.24 --> 942.37
because yeah I did think it was a

940.49 --> 947.23
worthwhile experience and if you join

942.37 --> 952.04
enjoy disaster movies in general and

947.23 --> 956.03
space stuff well one giant space

952.04 --> 959.18
disaster basically but it's really funny

956.03 --> 960.62
yeah the wondering earth that's from the

959.18 --> 966.1099999999999
day the wondering earth project

960.62 --> 969.32
initiated and it's also Chinese

966.11 --> 971.42
militaristic but I think it is like it

969.32 --> 974.6
there's like a Russian in

971.42 --> 977.3
it's and there's others so it's like I

974.6 --> 979.25
think it's probably sort of subtly

977.3 --> 982.8199999999999
suggested that it's a world government

979.25 --> 984.89
ruled by China pretty much or like they

982.82 --> 988.07
are on the throne as the most capable

984.89 --> 993.08
and everybody is with them that's the

988.07 --> 997.94
field that I get from it so I'm gonna

993.08 --> 1003.34
post a name in chit and it was on

997.94 --> 1006.07
Netflix just so all you ballers enjoy it

1003.34 --> 1012.12
love to hear your opinions about it they

1006.07 --> 1015.61
do there's like weird issues to it like

1012.12 --> 1018.61
ya supposed molten iron core and then

1015.61 --> 1021.82
certain types of impacts and such and

1018.61 --> 1024.07
like yeah it really does it work like

1021.82 --> 1026.8300000000002
that it they almost make it feel a

1024.07 --> 1028.8999999999999
little bit like ping-pong ball ish with

1026.83 --> 1030.76
with the ball yeah with the with the

1028.9 --> 1032.71
globes of the planets and everything

1030.76 --> 1036.34
eventually again like a ping-pong ball

1032.71 --> 1038.68
ish fields like very playful it's like

1036.34 --> 1040.4199999999998
oh yeah it'll be alright at first like

1038.68 --> 1043.26
oh my god this happens and then it's

1040.42 --> 1049.96
like oh wait we did we do this and

1043.26 --> 1051.46
boring oh it's okay now but takes a very

1049.96 --> 1053.23
long time with a lot of disasters

1051.46 --> 1055.21
happening in between a lot of people

1053.23 --> 1058.0
like oh [ __ ] we're trying to escape the

1055.21 --> 1062.68
disaster and everything collapsing and

1058.0 --> 1067.72
we have to bring the the engine

1062.68 --> 1069.5800000000002
restarting mechanism device from yeah we

1067.72 --> 1072.93
have to bring it back to the engines to

1069.58 --> 1076.78
restart it yeah a real mission driven

1072.93 --> 1083.97
movie I don't yeah the wandering earth I

1076.78 --> 1086.53
thought it was funny and very deep deep

1083.97 --> 1090.06
heliocentric programming in there you'll

1086.53 --> 1090.06
notice it the first second

1096.57 --> 1110.07
good morning Riley and Karen b2 by the

1101.44 --> 1110.0700000000002
way ahh hey Travis

1133.64 --> 1137.96
know what

1135.65 --> 1147.65
okay I'm getting some real freaky

1137.96 --> 1149.33
comments here yeah oh well yeah hey if

1147.65 --> 1155.8600000000001
any of you want to get on my panel

1149.33 --> 1155.86
please contact me Oh contact me on skype

1158.44 --> 1169.76
Karen or Anthony if you want to get on

1162.71 --> 1176.03
our Travis just let me know and I'll ya

1169.76 --> 1178.9
phone you in on skype all right but okay

1176.03 --> 1182.21
I'll get you in

1178.9 --> 1195.5500000000002
Riley has some complaints about Jam

1182.21 --> 1198.08
Panda hey hey hello how are you doing um

1195.55 --> 1200.24
you know I had Spurs on the phone if

1198.08 --> 1201.9499999999998
it's bears round me this morning and he

1200.24 --> 1204.14
says to me he says what do you think

1201.95 --> 1206.77
about the moon London's and I says not a

1204.14 --> 1209.15
lot I insist they were real honest is no

1206.77 --> 1210.77
racism what's your reason for not

1209.15 --> 1212.39
thinking that the real I thought there's

1210.77 --> 1214.1299999999999
loads reasons I said like do you want

1212.39 --> 1215.6000000000001
one my biggest proof of why the moon

1214.13 --> 1218.6000000000001
London's are not real he says yeah yeah

1215.6 --> 1220.34
I said okay it's logistics I said then I

1218.6 --> 1221.6
might not understand all the physics I

1220.34 --> 1223.01
might not understand all the maths I

1221.6 --> 1224.559
might not understand a lot of it but I

1223.01 --> 1226.55
understand that if you're gonna travel

1224.559 --> 1228.6499999999999
240,000 miles and it takes you three

1226.55 --> 1231.1399999999999
days to get there you've got it you've

1228.65 --> 1232.94
got to also travel 240,000 miles to get

1231.14 --> 1234.65
back and if they tell us it takes three

1232.94 --> 1236.21
days to get back then it tells you that

1234.65 --> 1241.0400000000002
they've got the same speed go in there

1236.21 --> 1244.48
as the app coming on he's like right the

1241.04 --> 1246.98
same route did they take the same route

1244.48 --> 1251.39
well how would you vary the rootstock

1246.98 --> 1256.309
offer the services and get a drink wait

1251.39 --> 1258.89
they they didn't they went by plane on

1256.309 --> 1262.01
apollo apollo 11 when they went to the

1258.89 --> 1263.99
moon right it went out with a rocket and

1262.01 --> 1265.73
they went to the moon there's only one

1263.99 --> 1268.48
way there in one way back oh sorry I

1265.73 --> 1270.85
completely lost track I guess

1268.48 --> 1273.67
you're talking about right so they went

1270.85 --> 1274.6899999999998
there and they went back so yeah so but

1273.67 --> 1277.03
the problem is if you look at the

1274.69 --> 1279.79
official statistics the data for what

1277.03 --> 1281.3799999999999
they tell us Apollo 11 was they say that

1279.79 --> 1282.97
it basically it was quicker for them to

1281.38 --> 1284.14
come home and they said well that's

1282.97 --> 1286.1200000000001
because the answer orbit the earth

1284.14 --> 1288.49
before they went there I was like right

1286.12 --> 1289.81
okay but it's still even if you orbit

1288.49 --> 1291.46
the Earth that'll take however long

1289.81 --> 1294.4299999999998
couple of hours maybe took around the

1291.46 --> 1296.38
earth or whatever like it was still even

1294.43 --> 1298.51
if it was the same in the same time

1296.38 --> 1300.88
duration to get home that means that the

1298.51 --> 1303.07
traveling at the same speed now if you

1300.88 --> 1305.41
do the distance 240 thousand miles if

1303.07 --> 1307.48
it's at its closest to 40 thousand miles

1305.41 --> 1310.0600000000002
and then divide that by 72 hours three

1307.48 --> 1312.76
days it gives you around about 3,300

1310.06 --> 1314.29
miles an hour so I can I can understand

1312.76 --> 1315.94
them get into the moon because they've

1314.29 --> 1317.83
used the Earth's atmosphere to propel

1315.94 --> 1319.99
off to be able to build up its velocity

1317.83 --> 1322.21
to slingshot away from Earth's orbit off

1319.99 --> 1324.34
to the moon but how did they get back

1322.21 --> 1326.23
from the moon when even if they've got a

1324.34 --> 1328.0
rocket booster and even if we give them

1326.23 --> 1330.07
that rocket to work in space which I

1328.0 --> 1331.48
don't even think there's no evidence

1330.07 --> 1333.7
that shows that they do at all

1331.48 --> 1336.31
the only evidence they've got perhaps is

1333.7 --> 1338.44
a little bit of recoil but they've still

1336.31 --> 1340.96
gotta get that velocity up to 3,300

1338.44 --> 1342.64
roughly miles an hour and they were

1340.96 --> 1344.8600000000001
setting off from zero from the moon

1342.64 --> 1352.8100000000002
they've got no atmosphere to push off

1344.86 --> 1354.58
even if rocket did work it's one eighth

1352.81 --> 1356.59
of the Earth's atmosphere is named it's

1354.58 --> 1358.27
not a lot oh no hang on that's gravity

1356.59 --> 1359.83
no no the earth doesn't know the moon

1358.27 --> 1361.6299999999999
doesn't have an atmosphere as far as I

1359.83 --> 1363.1899999999998
can remember no no it was within the

1361.63 --> 1366.1000000000001
atmosphere of the earth there is

1363.19 --> 1368.28
somebody yeah now it is how no but it's

1366.1 --> 1371.74
always been that they're just

1368.28 --> 1375.01
discovering it now yeah I know but they

1371.74 --> 1376.81
write their version is that back at the

1375.01 --> 1378.34
time when I research this was that the

1376.81 --> 1380.2
moon didn't have an atmosphere and it

1378.34 --> 1383.4399999999998
did have one eighth of the gravity of

1380.2 --> 1385.75
Earth right that was their position so I

1383.44 --> 1387.91
said okay but it still took them three

1385.75 --> 1389.2
days to get home so they still gotta get

1387.91 --> 1391.3600000000001
to three thousand three hundred mile an

1389.2 --> 1393.76
hour let's just give you that Rockets

1391.36 --> 1395.6499999999999
work right you've seen the landing that

1393.76 --> 1398.98
the lunar module that they took off the

1395.65 --> 1400.7800000000002
surface of the moon with right where did

1398.98 --> 1401.92
where did they get the propulsion from

1400.78 --> 1405.01
to get up to 3,000

1401.92 --> 1408.64
300 miles an hour they mean that they re

1405.01 --> 1411.8799999999999
docked there was like a special module

1408.64 --> 1413.5300000000002
in the in orbit of the moon right yeah

1411.88 --> 1414.88
that's what I thought Spurs said he

1413.53 --> 1418.51
doesn't think that's right and I said I

1414.88 --> 1420.25
can't remember yeah I thought I thought

1418.51 --> 1421.48
that was right too but he said he said

1420.25 --> 1423.13
he doesn't think so and I said well it's

1421.48 --> 1424.6
about 15 years since I looked at this so

1423.13 --> 1426.7600000000002
it may not be right but go and check it

1424.6 --> 1428.8
but even if there was and even if

1426.76 --> 1430.09
Rockets do work in space they're not

1428.8 --> 1431.44
going to work the way that they tell us

1430.09 --> 1434.7099999999998
because you need the atmosphere to push

1431.44 --> 1436.56
off kara has always been atmosphere

1434.71 --> 1441.7
there apparently it was a Mitch

1436.56 --> 1443.23
misjudgment so even whatever thin the

1441.7 --> 1445.96
atmosphere is the Rockets are gonna be

1443.23 --> 1448.21
incredibly inefficient they're gonna

1445.96 --> 1450.1000000000001
require huge amounts of propulsion to be

1448.21 --> 1452.2
able to go a slow speed that is

1450.1 --> 1454.9299999999998
definitely correct even with low

1452.2 --> 1457.9
pressure it is already problematic and

1454.93 --> 1460.3
that requires space not space it

1457.9 --> 1462.5800000000002
requires volume and and containment or

1460.3 --> 1463.8999999999999
thrusting of some kind and we know that

1462.58 --> 1465.6399999999999
the lunar module did not have the

1463.9 --> 1467.41
ability to be able to do this even if it

1465.64 --> 1469.1200000000001
clipped onto another rocket it still

1467.41 --> 1471.7
requires lots of this stuff to be able

1469.12 --> 1473.5
to do it and I'm like well how did can

1471.7 --> 1475.75
you demonstrate what the mechanism that

1473.5 --> 1477.67
they actually used to build up to three

1475.75 --> 1479.98
thousand miles an hour 3,300 miles an

1477.67 --> 1481.63
hour minimum so that they can get back

1479.98 --> 1484.69
in three days because that's what it

1481.63 --> 1486.8700000000001
well supposedly look if something is in

1484.69 --> 1489.91
orbit of a moon that means that it's not

1486.87 --> 1492.25
really subjected fully to the gravity

1489.91 --> 1494.8200000000002
just supposedly enough to keep a

1492.25 --> 1498.58
perpetual falling motion around it and

1494.82 --> 1500.8
it is kind of yeah in between the

1498.58 --> 1505.4499999999998
gravities of Earth and the moon at that

1500.8 --> 1507.93
point supposedly and it would have yeah

1505.45 --> 1510.6100000000001
not a lot of resistance to escape and

1507.93 --> 1514.15
basically start to build up a momentum

1510.61 --> 1516.4299999999998
so right I don't know so it's all still

1514.15 --> 1518.8300000000002
flimsy though but yeah if you all

1516.43 --> 1523.39
presuppose it it could have kind of work

1518.83 --> 1525.07
now that's why I thought discovering the

1523.39 --> 1528.3700000000001
moon is within the atmosphere is so

1525.07 --> 1531.4299999999998
genius because it does actually address

1528.37 --> 1533.77
all these issues so this is whisper

1531.43 --> 1535.0700000000002
space goes back to the Lud's in jump

1533.77 --> 1536.45
under server and the

1535.07 --> 1538.279
the back and forth with them up on the

1536.45 --> 1539.75
back of what we've just talked about and

1538.279 --> 1541.279
basically Spurs said that they were

1539.75 --> 1542.809
losing and they were losing the tempers

1541.279 --> 1545.12
because they couldn't explain where the

1542.809 --> 1546.44
velocity came from and he wanted me to

1545.12 --> 1548.9899999999998
go in and listen to what they were

1546.44 --> 1551.48
saying so I went in to listen to what

1548.99 --> 1553.25
they were saying and I ended up getting

1551.48 --> 1555.82
involved in it and I ended up leaving

1553.25 --> 1557.659
shortly after because basically Jeremy

1555.82 --> 1561.47
criticizes Nathan for the mute button

1557.659 --> 1563.5700000000002
but then basically effectively mutes me

1561.47 --> 1565.58
by continuously interrupting me when I

1563.57 --> 1567.74
start speaking so there's just no point

1565.58 --> 1569.299
in me even being there so I ended up

1567.74 --> 1570.409
leaving and obviously they'll all hold

1569.299 --> 1572.69
each other's willies and say good job

1570.409 --> 1575.21
Jeremy he ran but at the end of the

1572.69 --> 1578.269
vision if you leave a ball or high fuel

1575.21 --> 1584.6000000000001
have 30 minutes of your victory gushing

1578.269 --> 1586.07
yeah yeah if I'm gonna get wasted if I'm

1584.6 --> 1587.4499999999998
gonna get continuously interrupted and I

1586.07 --> 1590.83
can't get my words out there's no

1587.45 --> 1590.8300000000002
conversation just bear with me a sec

1621.61 --> 1624.36
hmm

1628.51 --> 1639.01
oh that's a funny ones in their age well

1632.94 --> 1641.8600000000001
technically yes the Cold War was well it

1639.01 --> 1646.179
those things really did happen but the

1641.86 --> 1649.36
setup was a conspiracy it was basically

1646.179 --> 1650.98
the only karcz playing the countries off

1649.36 --> 1655.24
against one another to make a lot of

1650.98 --> 1658.03
money on military industry so the real

1655.24 --> 1661.929
reasons for it were fake but yeah [ __ ]

1658.03 --> 1666.21
did go on those people those military

1661.929 --> 1671.41
definitely did see each other as enemies

1666.21 --> 1673.03
item back so yes what gets on and I

1671.41 --> 1674.74
started having a conversation but I

1673.03 --> 1676.72
couldn't it asked me a question right

1674.74 --> 1679.69
but start to answer him and he would

1676.72 --> 1681.309
either literally interrupter so I'd stop

1679.69 --> 1682.8400000000001
let him finish and I'd say listen you

1681.309 --> 1684.97
asked me this question I've started to

1682.84 --> 1686.4099999999999
answer it you've interrupted is this

1684.97 --> 1687.7
conversation going to be one of them I

1686.41 --> 1689.74
said like otherwise there's no point in

1687.7 --> 1691.57
me being here so anyway he started going

1689.74 --> 1692.95
on a rant and then ask me another

1691.57 --> 1695.47
question and I said listen I'll answer

1692.95 --> 1697.66
it but promise me you'll let me answer I

1695.47 --> 1700.179
said up it's not okay to continuously

1697.66 --> 1702.25
interrupt anyway I started talking and

1700.179 --> 1704.0700000000002
he interrupted me on basically on a

1702.25 --> 1707.44
point where because I didn't say

1704.07 --> 1710.4099999999999
astronomy and I said astrology let's be

1707.44 --> 1712.8700000000001
honest who cares right they're very

1710.41 --> 1715.39
allergic to that word yeah but in yeah

1712.87 --> 1717.2199999999998
in its comes truancy I know it does

1715.39 --> 1720.429
matter cuz the point I was contrasting

1717.22 --> 1722.41
astrology or astronomy from a scientific

1720.429 --> 1724.8090000000002
method because neither of them have got

1722.41 --> 1726.8500000000001
an independent variable test know either

1724.809 --> 1728.2
them are a hypothesis test so it doesn't

1726.85 --> 1730.99
matter whether I say astronomy or

1728.2 --> 1734.53
astrology neither than comply but he

1730.99 --> 1736.99
wants astronomy to be science so we were

1734.53 --> 1739.87
arguing over what basically I just buy

1736.99 --> 1740.71
into Jon's rhetoric and and John's Dogma

1739.87 --> 1743.02
and all this and I'm like listen

1740.71 --> 1745.33
everything that John says is supported

1743.02 --> 1747.85
by numerous citations I said he

1745.33 --> 1750.52
dedicated a video to you anyway I got

1747.85 --> 1753.58
into I got an interim but not everything

1750.52 --> 1755.41
John does is all flawless absolutely not

1753.58 --> 1757.6
oh no I agree I don't agree men do

1755.41 --> 1759.22
something about his character my also

1757.6 --> 1762.4599999999998
talking about the things that he

1759.22 --> 1766.83
prescribes - yes he

1762.46 --> 1772.63
this weird misconstrue and see I believe

1766.83 --> 1775.1799999999998
about quantum mechanics which I don't is

1772.63 --> 1777.1000000000001
a construct it's it's foundationally a

1775.18 --> 1780.1000000000001
mathematical construct based on

1777.1 --> 1783.01
deduction from these experiments and

1780.1 --> 1786.3
these experiments have been real but a

1783.01 --> 1788.89
lot of it is just purely conceptual I

1786.3 --> 1790.93
don't I don't understand the quantum

1788.89 --> 1794.3700000000001
mechanics side to it I also agree that

1790.93 --> 1798.3
the point I do I understand what it is

1794.37 --> 1802.6299999999999
what is it well it is like a

1798.3 --> 1807.49
mathematical framework to try to explain

1802.63 --> 1813.13
very odd phenomenon but it is very much

1807.49 --> 1816.96
chance driven and a very calculus it's

1813.13 --> 1820.15
all calculate it's all math most of it I

1816.96 --> 1823.3
honestly don't know but yet there are

1820.15 --> 1826.74
very weird phenomena but I think that

1823.3 --> 1830.2
the quantum mechanics is basically a

1826.74 --> 1833.58
another pitfall when you go into the

1830.2 --> 1838.65
miniature based on presuppositions of

1833.58 --> 1842.77
unit based thinking for the micro scale

1838.65 --> 1845.0500000000002
in any event light particles electron

1842.77 --> 1848.41
particles that kind of thinking the

1845.05 --> 1851.29
particle thinking is what drives the

1848.41 --> 1853.72
calculus based nature of quantum

1851.29 --> 1856.36
mechanics do you understand this

1853.72 --> 1858.22
no that's why I just give way cuz I

1856.36 --> 1858.9099999999999
don't I'm not gonna well there you go

1858.22 --> 1862.09
see

1858.91 --> 1865.93
it's so complex but I can't get this I

1862.09 --> 1868.9199999999998
get the feel for it I say the content of

1865.93 --> 1871.63
what is being shown what is being used

1868.92 --> 1876.28
every time I always take a look just to

1871.63 --> 1877.7800000000002
see the patterns well I don't I'm happy

1876.28 --> 1879.16
to say that I don't really understand it

1877.78 --> 1880.93
and I just give way cuz I'm not gonna

1879.16 --> 1883.48
argue something that I'd have no idea on

1880.93 --> 1885.79
even trying to understand it I just let

1883.48 --> 1888.04
John to it because he's you know he

1885.79 --> 1889.75
seems he seems to know if somebody's got

1888.04 --> 1891.3999999999999
something against John on quanta I'm

1889.75 --> 1893.92
pretty sure John will be able to address

1891.4 --> 1896.0900000000001
it and so I just leave him to it I

1893.92 --> 1898.309
couldn't challenge ansan some of that I

1896.09 --> 1900.32
don't understand but I do understand

1898.309 --> 1902.48
that even if there is an orbiter

1900.32 --> 1904.279
orbiting Moo right they still gotta get

1902.48 --> 1906.2
that wonder thing up to it and catch up

1904.279 --> 1909.11
to the orbiter speed but there's no

1906.2 --> 1911.8700000000001
atmosphere to push off so I saw somebody

1909.11 --> 1916.1299999999999
in chat then and it wasn't our my

1911.87 --> 1918.62
Supergirl charge right

1916.13 --> 1920.419
but it's the if the orbiter is if the

1918.62 --> 1922.1299999999999
orbiter is still orbits in the moon with

1920.419 --> 1924.71
this with the built up speed that it had

1922.13 --> 1927.47
when it was on its way to from the earth

1924.71 --> 1929.21
then that all the the lunar lander still

1927.47 --> 1931.549
got a build that speed up to the orbital

1929.21 --> 1934.52
speed and how it hasn't got the product

1931.549 --> 1937.45
the projection or the the propulsion to

1934.52 --> 1942.62
be able to do it that's my point

1937.45 --> 1944.45
it might have seriously they they

1942.62 --> 1946.4599999999998
probably thought about this even at

1944.45 --> 1949.6100000000001
least conceptually and say like okay

1946.46 --> 1951.5
this gravity whatever atmosphere

1949.61 --> 1954.08
atmosphere is basically friction when

1951.5 --> 1955.94
you try to escape gravity okay so if the

1954.08 --> 1960.1999999999998
atmosphere is light then it's basically

1955.94 --> 1964.97
off against one another so they just he

1960.2 --> 1966.8300000000002
did explosive charge to thrust right get

1964.97 --> 1969.6490000000001
that momentum that's how they figure

1966.83 --> 1971.6899999999998
it's not a rocket push its boom and

1969.649 --> 1975.59
momentum instant momentum like being

1971.69 --> 1977.45
launched out of a gun I get it well that

1975.59 --> 1979.279
doesn't change the fact that the orbiter

1977.45 --> 1982.039
is still orbiting the moon whilst the

1979.279 --> 1985.19
the lunar the landing the lunar module

1982.039 --> 1987.2
as it's that module has got to get up to

1985.19 --> 1989.39
the speed of the loon the the orbiting

1987.2 --> 1990.74
orbiter and that's doing around about

1989.39 --> 1993.38
three thousand three hundred miles an

1990.74 --> 1994.82
hour roughly not exactly but roughly how

1993.38 --> 1996.529
is it doing that when it hasn't got the

1994.82 --> 1998.27
ability to move all right you've got the

1996.529 --> 1999.35
initiative doesn't you've got the

1998.27 --> 2001.149
initial you've got the initial

1999.35 --> 2004.6899999999998
explosions that they just arrived off

2001.149 --> 2006.61
yeah yeah the side thrusters don't work

2004.69 --> 2009.3990000000001
when there's no space you need the

2006.61 --> 2011.4399999999998
atmosphere to push off for yeah that

2009.399 --> 2013.51
part that's where it gets faked you know

2011.44 --> 2019.179
and it's supposedly at least little

2013.51 --> 2022.299
atmosphere so I don't know exactly the

2019.179 --> 2023.919
content size of these propulsion tanks

2022.299 --> 2025.72
for the side thrusters I don't know how

2023.919 --> 2027.97
much was in there how much they use I

2025.72 --> 2030.71
have no idea of these statistics

2027.97 --> 2033.23
the lumber is trim there now this kind

2030.71 --> 2035.24
of thing the lander is travelling with

2033.23 --> 2036.88
speed whilst on the moon it isn't it's

2035.24 --> 2039.56
relative speed to the moon is zero

2036.88 --> 2042.2600000000002
relative speed to the to the lots of the

2039.56 --> 2043.73
orbiter is zero and the lander is

2042.26 --> 2046.34
travelling with speed while on the moon

2043.73 --> 2048.2
zero relative to the moon but inertia to

2046.34 --> 2049.91
travel back to earth know it that's my

2048.2 --> 2052.1899999999996
point it doesn't have any inertia to

2049.91 --> 2053.81
travel back to earth even if we even

2052.19 --> 2056.36
with the orbiter going round it right

2053.81 --> 2059.72
that's going around about 3,000 feet it

2056.36 --> 2062.21
was not lunar stationary as it were

2059.72 --> 2064.25
no it's orbit in it's in a free it's in

2062.21 --> 2066.2
a freefall isn't it it's right orbiting

2064.25 --> 2069.65
around the moon right it's really moving

2066.2 --> 2071.21
over its surface as it were yeah but

2069.65 --> 2073.19
whatever is going on with the speed

2071.21 --> 2075.26
without that orbiter that that thing

2073.19 --> 2077.57
that takes off that explosion is gonna

2075.26 --> 2079.01
give it a recoil explosion that moves it

2077.57 --> 2081.1400000000003
about three mile an hour

2079.01 --> 2082.5800000000004
you saw how slow it moved it didn't go

2081.14 --> 2084.35
well it wasn't like a rocket launch now

2082.58 --> 2086.2999999999997
because the Rockets launch from Earth

2084.35 --> 2088.63
with the atmosphere behind them that's

2086.3 --> 2091.8500000000004
what the pushing off well I was out

2088.63 --> 2093.38
after that initial explosion to catch up

2091.85 --> 2096.2599999999998
to the orbiter how the hell is it gonna

2093.38 --> 2099.58
do that that was my point right so

2096.26 --> 2102.2000000000003
you're basically suggesting the math of

2099.58 --> 2104.12
all the mechanical forces the

2102.2 --> 2105.7999999999997
presupposed mechanical forces and

2104.12 --> 2108.8599999999997
settings don't work out that's what

2105.8 --> 2111.9500000000003
you're suggesting I lose my track of

2108.86 --> 2113.6600000000003
things because the little things in the

2111.95 --> 2115.72
math between how that's supposed to work

2113.66 --> 2118.1299999999997
I have no oversight how that works

2115.72 --> 2120.02
nothing to do with math whatsoever no

2118.13 --> 2121.55
it's all to do with the logistics of

2120.02 --> 2123.41
physically game versus right you're

2121.55 --> 2125.9900000000002
calculating does it have enough force to

2123.41 --> 2127.67
actually escape with you know I'm not

2125.99 --> 2130.3999999999996
calculating anything I'm saying that

2127.67 --> 2131.57
they've got no no medium to push off to

2130.4 --> 2133.52
be able to get the speed that's

2131.57 --> 2135.5
necessary to catch up to the lunes the

2133.52 --> 2137.36
the orbital speed they haven't got any

2135.5 --> 2140.6
more any propulsion I

2137.36 --> 2145.4900000000002
oh really so you have the schematics of

2140.6 --> 2147.2
the that moon lander you have it so it

2145.49 --> 2148.6699999999996
goes back to do rockets work in space or

2147.2 --> 2150.98
not and the only thing that they can

2148.67 --> 2153.71
supposedly still some atmosphere there

2150.98 --> 2156.98
so then you'll have to work out ghetto

2153.71 --> 2160.1
with little atmosphere that wasn't there

2156.98 --> 2161.84
couldn't have enough momentum with no

2160.1 --> 2164.0899999999997
intent probably stopped

2161.84 --> 2167.57
stop that they tell us there's no

2164.09 --> 2169.4
atmosphere on the moon there's there's

2167.57 --> 2171.1400000000003
one-eighth of the gravity but there's

2169.4 --> 2172.82
zero atmosphere they do they say there's

2171.14 --> 2175.37
no atmosphere on the moon now we've seen

2172.82 --> 2177.4
the models that they present it of how

2175.37 --> 2182.24
they figure it out it actually

2177.4 --> 2183.98
supposedly is and there is we we can

2182.24 --> 2185.33
argue within their model if you want to

2183.98 --> 2187.22
it doesn't change the fact that they've

2185.33 --> 2189.2
still got a logistics problem of getting

2187.22 --> 2191.87
up the velocity required for the lander

2189.2 --> 2195.3199999999997
to either reconnect or trip build up to

2191.87 --> 2198.1099999999997
three at 3,300 whatever but you actually

2195.32 --> 2200.4700000000003
prove that with calculations of me all

2198.11 --> 2205.51
the force no calculations yes yes that's

2200.47 --> 2208.04
unfortunately no Harry to calculations

2205.51 --> 2209.42
calculations don't prove anything our

2208.04 --> 2212.35
when you fallen into their trap of

2209.42 --> 2214.55
pseudoscience but we're already into

2212.35 --> 2217.04
pseudoscience by even entertaining the

2214.55 --> 2218.6600000000003
possibility of it so you know they go if

2217.04 --> 2221.3
you're gonna go into it you gotta go

2218.66 --> 2224.62
with it and then you prove or disprove

2221.3 --> 2226.73
with math because that's also you go by

2224.62 --> 2228.2
gleam says look at the slingshot effect

2226.73 --> 2229.79
they say it's the gravity pull

2228.2 --> 2231.56
differential tugging it left and right

2229.79 --> 2233.96
then using this angular momentum as they

2231.56 --> 2236.09
say they say gravity slings it and

2233.96 --> 2238.4
accelerates right it gravity's not

2236.09 --> 2240.1400000000003
strong the force of gravity and in the

2238.4 --> 2243.5
middle of the two planets is virtually

2240.14 --> 2245.27
zero and even if it was strong you've

2243.5 --> 2247.07
got a lot of gravity to be able to pull

2245.27 --> 2248.72
something that's to get the speed up

2247.07 --> 2252.38
it's nonsense

2248.72 --> 2255.5899999999997
it's Auto garbage of course it is but

2252.38 --> 2258.62
still if you're gonna say look I think

2255.59 --> 2262.52
it doesn't have enough capability to

2258.62 --> 2264.47
supposedly come off the moon with how

2262.52 --> 2267.86
the mechanics of everything in the

2264.47 --> 2269.81
setting is supposedly now and has always

2267.86 --> 2271.46
been they discovered it that's how it

2269.81 --> 2273.77
works that's how they that's how the

2271.46 --> 2277.01
body of science works they update it

2273.77 --> 2279.29
like figure it out right so then you

2277.01 --> 2281.6000000000004
have to go with what is presented as the

2279.29 --> 2287.09
new setting and then prove it's not

2281.6 --> 2290.24
possible by math by working out the the

2287.09 --> 2292.34
forces within the propulsion system or

2290.24 --> 2293.5699999999997
however they got off there and the

2292.34 --> 2296.42
volume of the tank

2293.57 --> 2298.01
everything the mechanics opposing the

2296.42 --> 2300.56
settings these forces gravity of the

2298.01 --> 2302.84
moon and all the propulsion

2300.56 --> 2305.54
yeah the these supposed atmosphere that

2302.84 --> 2308.06
is present around the moon thanks to its

2305.54 --> 2310.55
proximity to the earth as it were so you

2308.06 --> 2312.77
gotta take that into account and now I

2310.55 --> 2314.3900000000003
feel a little hypocritical because if

2312.77 --> 2316.22
somebody told me to do this I would

2314.39 --> 2319.31
never do it because I think this kind of

2316.22 --> 2321.35
thing sucks the calculus with that [ __ ]

2319.31 --> 2325.0099999999998
there's some people out there they're

2321.35 --> 2326.87
really good at it so leave it to them if

2325.01 --> 2327.2000000000003
they're just being really honest about

2326.87 --> 2329.06
it

2327.2 --> 2331.25
then it's okay and if they're not being

2329.06 --> 2335.06
honest about it we'll figure it out as

2331.25 --> 2337.82
they try to present their explanation so

2335.06 --> 2341.54
yeah maybe one of the ballers like

2337.82 --> 2343.6600000000003
cinder or something maybe Apollo would

2341.54 --> 2346.82
like to try and figure that one out and

2343.66 --> 2351.0499999999997
see a sleeper sleeping warrior is onto

2346.82 --> 2354.1400000000003
something here unless he unless you

2351.05 --> 2362.75
really want to do it yourself and go at

2354.14 --> 2364.67
it what do you say I think that it's a

2362.75 --> 2366.44
dream and if you want the dream enough

2364.67 --> 2368.12
you'll make it happen in your own dream

2366.44 --> 2370.1
and then nobody can disprove your own

2368.12 --> 2374.21
dreams because you're they are your own

2370.1 --> 2377.69
but even dreams have rules no if you're

2374.21 --> 2380.87
the dreamer now but then the dream will

2377.69 --> 2382.55
be rejected by others it only you can

2380.87 --> 2388.39
only share the same dream if you all

2382.55 --> 2388.3900000000003
abide by the rules see

2390.68 --> 2395.94
anyway yeah if you don't want to do it I

2393.18 --> 2397.739
get it I have no memory I'm really I'm

2395.94 --> 2400.44
I'm reading somewhere but to be honest

2397.739 --> 2402.209
with you unless they can prove that it I

2400.44 --> 2404.459
mean it's not about proving it within

2402.209 --> 2407.3999999999996
maths it's about proving that it it

2404.459 --> 2410.0989999999997
happened and at the end of the day it's

2407.4 --> 2412.739
the proof to prove on a little shitty

2410.099 --> 2415.469
video or a little some photos that are

2412.739 --> 2417.119
all dodgy as hell basically don't prove

2415.469 --> 2417.809
it and if they want to believe it

2417.119 --> 2419.069
they'll believe it

2417.809 --> 2421.2290000000003
but there's no point in arguing with

2419.069 --> 2422.759
them because like I said it's their

2421.229 --> 2428.2189999999996
dream so they're gonna want their dream

2422.759 --> 2433.709
to be true it doesn't matter because

2428.219 --> 2437.13
despite all the claims we still have the

2433.709 --> 2442.739
gas pressure requires a container

2437.13 --> 2447.4500000000003
argument and that's not even address so

2442.739 --> 2450.509
not really it's addressed with a clearly

2447.45 --> 2454.8289999999997
broken presupposition or thing with

2450.509 --> 2457.979
gravity with they know that the original

2454.829 --> 2462.9
mechanics of that actually can't allow

2457.979 --> 2465.0589999999997
that to do and what they say it does so

2462.9 --> 2468.799
it's broken there it's a clear gap in

2465.059 --> 2471.329
the model and they interest in addressed

2468.799 --> 2473.249
interesting that super curve says we ask

2471.329 --> 2474.539
you for proof and you fall apart yet

2473.249 --> 2476.6989999999996
failing to provide the proof in the

2474.539 --> 2478.6800000000003
first place of your own assertions you

2476.699 --> 2480.839
criticize me for not providing proof

2478.68 --> 2486.39
against your non proof don't think so

2480.839 --> 2487.8289999999997
[ __ ] yeah by the way if there's

2486.39 --> 2490.7889999999998
somebody else here wants to join in

2487.829 --> 2490.789
maybe chocolate

2492.98 --> 2501.05
Karen B I can add you in with our

2497.3 --> 2507.71
conversation if you like just let me

2501.05 --> 2510.28
know in Skype Jack that sorry I'm hoping

2507.71 --> 2520.4900000000002
just add him I'm just gonna add you

2510.28 --> 2523.52
chocolate there you go do you look as

2520.49 --> 2526.3399999999997
well like a queen obviously problem on

2523.52 --> 2528.41
the moon and relative to the orbiter it

2526.34 --> 2530.63
is traveling at zero relative to the

2528.41 --> 2539.0899999999997
orbiter there you go that cheap proof

2530.63 --> 2541.03
math bro you never heard of Lagrange

2539.09 --> 2551.4500000000003
point

2541.03 --> 2554.51
hello guys hear me yeah look a hos

2551.45 --> 2557.5699999999997
danger invite Jose and Karen be through

2554.51 --> 2558.05
one-on-one fun oh they were [ __ ] do

2557.57 --> 2562.9700000000003
it man

2558.05 --> 2569.9
I I'm trying to get Karen B but I can't

2562.97 --> 2573.7099999999996
find her in the list it's annoying Karen

2569.9 --> 2576.59
B is on top I can't see her it's not

2573.71 --> 2578.18
appearing in my list segregation great

2576.59 --> 2580.01
you know there's a great there's a great

2578.18 --> 2585.64
one-liner about being on top I'm not

2580.01 --> 2588.8900000000003
gonna mention it what Jose guys Jose

2585.64 --> 2592.22
every time I say something is subtly

2588.89 --> 2594.5899999999997
sensual am i that's sexy because Jose

2592.22 --> 2599.93
was being a dirt well good morning oh

2594.59 --> 2602.3
hey you know I have a lot me here I

2599.93 --> 2604.3399999999997
haven't got me particulate counting

2602.3 --> 2606.6800000000003
meter yet for my eggy I tell you what

2604.34 --> 2607.73
well you know my income in experiment

2606.68 --> 2609.74
that I'm planning on doing in the next

2607.73 --> 2612.08
couple of days with my egg in the salt

2609.74 --> 2613.85
water you actually need a lot of salt to

2612.08 --> 2616.1
me to change to then see the water to

2613.85 --> 2617.2999999999997
make the egg move over I've got a tray

2616.1 --> 2619.13
of 16 eggs right

2617.3 --> 2624.3700000000003
and I've gone through all 16 eggs and

2619.13 --> 2627.83
they all sink rubbish

2624.37 --> 2633.2
what does that mean it just means I need

2627.83 --> 2637.22
more salt you're gonna say it means your

2633.2 --> 2638.75
eggs are rotten no well no good they're

2637.22 --> 2639.95
off they're all fresh the running board

2638.75 --> 2642.98
the day before because it was shopping

2639.95 --> 2644.27
day on what they will think she she had

2642.98 --> 2647.18
a waiter shopping yesterday or today I

2644.27 --> 2649.1
think yesterday but the point is none of

2647.18 --> 2650.5699999999997
them float so I thought I'd probably get

2649.1 --> 2652.79
two or three to flow in two or three

2650.57 --> 2654.1400000000003
that sunk may get the odd one or two in

2652.79 --> 2656.21
the middle that didn't and I thought

2654.14 --> 2658.0699999999997
that'd be a wide range of readex

2656.21 --> 2659.78
different different results from the

2658.07 --> 2661.34
different eggs and how big the air

2659.78 --> 2663.8900000000003
pocket is inside the egg right because

2661.34 --> 2666.05
that's where the buoyancy comes from on

2663.89 --> 2668.45
their model the the air pocket inside

2666.05 --> 2670.04
the egg but ultimately it's like the old

2668.45 --> 2672.35
sank and I'm like right so I've now got

2670.04 --> 2673.67
to find the least dense one I haven't

2672.35 --> 2676.37
found one yet I've been putting more and

2673.67 --> 2679.79
more salt and they all stink so no I'm

2676.37 --> 2682.31
not winning yet oh and I was gonna do it

2679.79 --> 2684.23
I found this really tall thin and glass

2682.31 --> 2686.42
see-through bars it's perfect for what I

2684.23 --> 2688.34
want but the volume is about ten times

2686.42 --> 2689.9300000000003
more volume than what my pint glass is

2688.34 --> 2691.28
that I've been testing me again in a

2689.93 --> 2693.77
minute and that's taking a shitload of

2691.28 --> 2696.8
salt but I'm not quite sure how this is

2693.77 --> 2698.45
gonna work out yeah I might have to put

2696.8 --> 2702.44
some like really dense fluid at the

2698.45 --> 2705.0099999999998
bottom to create a density low speed off

2702.44 --> 2709.31
a little bit hmm

2705.01 --> 2712.67
yeah it's not cool okay he's gonna have

2709.31 --> 2714.29
to invest in some sort brother yeah I'll

2712.67 --> 2716.15
have to give some serious insults on a

2714.29 --> 2717.44
totally different note you guys are

2716.15 --> 2721.52
worth at the slice of arcane is

2717.44 --> 2727.37
completed is his flat water curved water

2721.52 --> 2729.2
test ya know so he was basically doing a

2727.37 --> 2732.23
canal at the side of a canal he had a

2729.2 --> 2734.6
like a mile-long length of tube and then

2732.23 --> 2737.27
he had verticals that were placed 100

2734.6 --> 2739.0699999999997
meet every hundred meters or so and he'd

2737.27 --> 2740.99
fill them up with water and then the

2739.07 --> 2744.92
water would find its level and he'd

2740.99 --> 2746.8399999999997
pre-marked the glass with set rates and

2744.92 --> 2750.08
he's working on the concept that the

2746.84 --> 2753.59
water is either level or curved over the

2750.08 --> 2756.7999999999997
mile so if he's marked off like a given

2753.59 --> 2759.98
height above the verticals for each pipe

2756.8 --> 2761.36
than that I'll give him a rough idea of

2759.98 --> 2763.55
whether or not the water's coming in

2761.36 --> 2765.77
flat or curved or not because he's

2763.55 --> 2768.3500000000004
basing it on a canal so basically if he

2765.77 --> 2770.45
if he's got a fixed flat line across the

2768.35 --> 2772.3399999999997
top and he's got a perceived flat or

2770.45 --> 2774.0499999999997
curved line along the bottom the water

2772.34 --> 2775.79
will conform to the flat or the curved

2774.05 --> 2777.53
line along the bottom and he'll be able

2775.79 --> 2779.69
to use his met his measurement line as

2777.53 --> 2782.4500000000003
the the goal between which I thought was

2779.69 --> 2785.54
quite good actually however he's deemed

2782.45 --> 2788.93
his own work as inconclusive and but

2785.54 --> 2792.34
leaning towards sphere and I'm like how

2788.93 --> 2795.14
can it be in conclusion yeah he's

2792.34 --> 2796.7000000000003
inconclusive but it leans towards sphere

2795.14 --> 2798.6189999999997
but he said that there's some faults

2796.7 --> 2800.5699999999997
with it and I went to look at the

2798.619 --> 2803.33
results and but it's the hanger was like

2800.57 --> 2807.44
an hour and most of slides work is like

2803.33 --> 2809.48
um and AH delay so it's not easy to

2807.44 --> 2811.67
watch lie and even though I'll do quite

2809.48 --> 2812.869
like his content generally and I just

2811.67 --> 2815.15
said to him can you do as a short

2812.869 --> 2817.1000000000004
concise video with the with the results

2815.15 --> 2818.89
and what your interpretation is and and

2817.1 --> 2821.93
then show us how you got your results um

2818.89 --> 2823.79
and he said no and I was like well I'm

2821.93 --> 2825.35
not sitting through for an hour so what

2823.79 --> 2827.359
I did was a contact in one of his gay

2825.35 --> 2829.31
boy dick holding friends called Hillel

2827.359 --> 2831.68
fender and I just asked him what was the

2829.31 --> 2833.99
conclusion of his so is his test his

2831.68 --> 2837.3799999999997
water test and he said them and I'll

2833.99 --> 2840.5899999999997
read to you what he said he said he's

2837.38 --> 2845.81
finished it'll all about her right is

2840.59 --> 2847.55
his response the glorious the data is in

2845.81 --> 2849.59
the result appears to follow the globe

2847.55 --> 2852.44
expectation but because of some flaws

2849.59 --> 2855.2000000000003
mistakes and anomalies whatever anomaly

2852.44 --> 2857.0
whatever anomalies means slides calling

2855.2 --> 2859.73
it inconclusive but with a globe

2857.0 --> 2861.619
tendency so I said [ __ ] it should

2859.73 --> 2863.78
show flat and perhaps inconclusive and

2861.619 --> 2865.73
is he keeping all of the pipes so that

2863.78 --> 2867.05
others can replicate his work and then

2865.73 --> 2868.43
he's just challenged me on why I said

2867.05 --> 2871.01
[ __ ] and I'm it's not worth going

2868.43 --> 2874.64
into what my point is that he's had a go

2871.01 --> 2876.53
at it fair play and his conclusion is

2874.64 --> 2878.75
inconclusive but he's leaning towards

2876.53 --> 2880.369
globe and I'm like right so it just

2878.75 --> 2882.8
needs to be repeated by somebody else

2880.369 --> 2885.05
like so I'll let him do it again and

2882.8 --> 2887.6600000000003
then make it a conclusive decision so

2885.05 --> 2889.4300000000003
that it's not wishy-washy but it's

2887.66 --> 2890.18
actually it's quite a good I think it's

2889.43 --> 2891.89
quite a good idea

2890.18 --> 2893.27
and I'm pleased he's actually gotta go

2891.89 --> 2894.859
with it because it gives us some what to

2893.27 --> 2896.72
consider when we get some decent results

2894.859 --> 2897.98
from it but if he's declared it as

2896.72 --> 2899.8999999999996
inconclusive there's not really much

2897.98 --> 2905.96
point in talking about it but just be

2899.9 --> 2907.76
aware that he's done it anyway Oh mr.

2905.96 --> 2910.789
Sun hmm

2907.76 --> 2914.1400000000003
fell for that failed to prove curved

2910.789 --> 2915.5200000000004
though that's the most important bit oh

2914.14 --> 2920.92
yeah

2915.52 --> 2922.49
that's because there's not curved always

2920.92 --> 2928.869
found it by now

2922.49 --> 2931.8489999999997
we would have to be waiting for slice so

2928.869 --> 2935.569
all right so I said so I said to slice

2931.849 --> 2937.1600000000003
ed can you do a short video explaining

2935.569 --> 2938.9
how you recorded the relative Heights of

2937.16 --> 2940.67
the war Alliance what you recover what

2938.9 --> 2943.1600000000003
you record it and how you interpreted it

2940.67 --> 2945.77
I'm not watching arms and ears and delay

2943.16 --> 2947.8999999999996
no offence and his response was nope and

2945.77 --> 2949.16
who's right okay I said then I've got no

2947.9 --> 2950.599
real interest in it and I thought the

2949.16 --> 2952.339
car address it on Nathan's as I've got

2950.599 --> 2953.0
nothing to see the results of good job

2952.339 --> 2956.359
loser

2953.0 --> 2957.74
and then his response was and Darren and

2956.359 --> 2959.45
I was so looking forward to the

2957.74 --> 2961.1899999999996
commentary from those who do no research

2959.45 --> 2963.5589999999997
perform no experiments and I've nothing

2961.19 --> 2967.309
to volley nothing of value to contribute

2963.559 --> 2969.23
to society in general nice job but

2967.309 --> 2971.21
basically it's inconclusive and by his

2969.23 --> 2975.67
own admission so that's really a failing

2971.21 --> 2980.9900000000002
to proof okay okay

2975.67 --> 2983.539
shocking yeah that's giving me an IV

2980.99 --> 2986.5589999999997
though it has given me an idea though

2983.539 --> 2989.4500000000003
and I'm gonna run it by dr. John D and

2986.559 --> 2991.01
I'll give you a sneak preview and we

2989.45 --> 2994.069
could probably repeat what slice done

2991.01 --> 2995.42
and I've been four levels it's that

2994.069 --> 2998.45
stretch on Bedford levels because

2995.42 --> 3000.9700000000003
basically that stretch or just a mile a

2998.45 --> 3003.1299999999997
bit at do and we could put in a pipe

3000.97 --> 3004.8689999999997
with a mile like why well slide it put

3003.13 --> 3007.599
in the verticals but leave it in sit you

3004.869 --> 3009.279
fill it up with water and set the

3007.599 --> 3011.349
markers before we do it like slice them

3009.279 --> 3013.869
and then basically used to Bedford

3011.349 --> 3016.6600000000003
levels to prove whether Wallace or

3013.869 --> 3019.4500000000003
John Hamden was correct because I think

3016.66 --> 3021.3689999999997
slice point is that if you as if you

3019.45 --> 3023.4199999999996
have a fixed if you measure a certain

3021.369 --> 3025.579
point on the on the tubes that the

3023.42 --> 3027.98
use all the way across so that you know

3025.579 --> 3030.71
that that point represents a point above

3027.98 --> 3033.44
water that is measured each like all the

3030.71 --> 3035.15
time as long as the tube gets down to

3033.44 --> 3036.559
the water level and then you fill it all

3035.15 --> 3038.569
up again if you water level this

3036.559 --> 3041.1800000000003
following the line then it's basically

3038.569 --> 3042.619
going to be curved and or flat depending

3041.18 --> 3044.839
on whether it's following the line or

3042.619 --> 3047.559
not following the line and I I actually

3044.839 --> 3049.64
agree with the the concept it's just

3047.559 --> 3051.92
executing it yeah probably seems these

3049.64 --> 3053.54
are problems doing it but I thought we

3051.92 --> 3057.5
could probably repeat that over a mile

3053.54 --> 3058.97
at Bedford levels just as its named and

3057.5 --> 3062.78
we could prove Hamden right or wrong

3058.97 --> 3066.89
without any refraction arguments what

3062.78 --> 3070.7900000000004
you even could do is take a not a small

3066.89 --> 3075.14
tube but a pretty big pipe like a rain

3070.79 --> 3078.5589999999997
pipe make it very long and it has to be

3075.14 --> 3080.71
straight pretty much and then see if you

3078.559 --> 3084.799
yeah you could do water in it whatever

3080.71 --> 3088.069
water level it as you said and then even

3084.799 --> 3091.7
put a light on one side very very bright

3088.069 --> 3093.71
light yeah refraction test if yeah is

3091.7 --> 3095.66
that curved or can you see straight

3093.71 --> 3097.73
through it because of it is curved then

3095.66 --> 3100.339
you could definitely not see straight

3097.73 --> 3102.049
through it yeah well you are looking

3100.339 --> 3104.119
through dense medium change there on you

3102.049 --> 3106.339
hard boundaries and stuff it wouldn't

3104.119 --> 3107.69
work that what the waist slides done it

3106.339 --> 3110.72
is quite good but I don't know if it

3107.69 --> 3116.51
according to their autograph they go

3110.72 --> 3118.5789999999997
girl can hey you can't do an optical

3116.51 --> 3121.0690000000004
side view can you can't do an optical

3118.579 --> 3123.1090000000004
measurement no of course but for them

3121.069 --> 3125.66
look if it is supposedly gonna prove

3123.109 --> 3128.9
curvature then you should be able to

3125.66 --> 3130.7
look through a super-fast tube and if it

3128.9 --> 3133.309
was perfectly straight then you would be

3130.7 --> 3137.5099999999998
able to have a direct line of sight that

3133.309 --> 3143.17
thing on the other side right shout-out

3137.51 --> 3143.17
to Muppet vision our tract it

3144.509 --> 3148.66
you know what Karen I was listening back

3146.589 --> 3152.979
to that you know the Christmas show with

3148.66 --> 3154.089
me Kanaan I am real media yeah I

3152.979 --> 3157.4199999999996
remember that

3154.089 --> 3159.759
do you remember ace MacLeod Shou yeah

3157.42 --> 3161.319
that was the first time that that was

3159.759 --> 3164.0190000000002
the first time that shout out refractive

3161.319 --> 3165.819
gaming yes I'm listening to your

3164.019 --> 3167.0789999999997
reaction because I could just I can hear

3165.819 --> 3168.549
you move backwards in your chair

3167.079 --> 3173.0190000000002
laughing at the time cuz you moved away

3168.549 --> 3173.499
from microphone just it was just funny

3173.019 --> 3175.0589999999997
at the time

3173.499 --> 3177.279
and I was just listening back to it

3175.059 --> 3180.8390000000004
because that's one of your probably best

3177.279 --> 3184.42
moments of natural laughter that bird

3180.839 --> 3186.16
i'm priy from it you don't get it bad

3184.42 --> 3189.91
but you can have a refracted one the one

3186.16 --> 3193.209
that's not really mean to you that's

3189.91 --> 3194.769
right that's only going to make it more

3193.209 --> 3198.8799999999997
blurry though it's not gonna bend it

3194.769 --> 3201.16
around curves and I'll see even if light

3198.88 --> 3203.349
does like follow a curved path it can do

3201.16 --> 3205.359
it can follow if I kept on a plane as

3203.349 --> 3208.839
well doesn't need to be a shout-out now

3205.359 --> 3210.549
alright so yeah yeah gonna make a shout

3208.839 --> 3214.779
out blurry it's not gonna bend it around

3210.549 --> 3216.4
the corner yeah and it'll be in the

3214.779 --> 3223.15
wrong place you have to be stood round

3216.4 --> 3225.2490000000003
the corner to get it right anyway I need

3223.15 --> 3226.509
to get more salt I'm gonna have to get

3225.249 --> 3228.91
significantly more salt

3226.509 --> 3232.119
cuz they're gonna [ __ ] egg addiction

3228.91 --> 3235.3289999999997
is starting to cost Riley oh yeah you

3232.119 --> 3237.4
don't like it here I don't object I'm

3235.329 --> 3240.67
just thinking it's little silly how much

3237.4 --> 3242.589
you like to talk about it well it's

3240.67 --> 3244.329
important because in the scientific

3242.589 --> 3248.529
experiment your independent variables

3244.329 --> 3250.059
you cause right and that's deep well if

3248.529 --> 3251.979
you're gonna add matter to the bottom of

3250.059 --> 3253.7490000000003
the glass then the egg should move down

3251.979 --> 3255.1299999999997
because it's being attracted to the

3253.749 --> 3257.229
increase in the mass according to

3255.13 --> 3258.369
gravitation right but it goes up so

3257.229 --> 3260.1699999999996
they've got a switch you're backwards

3258.369 --> 3263.049
and say it's the opposite well in

3260.17 --> 3264.94
scientific method you your cause is the

3263.049 --> 3267.279
thing that you're manipulating right so

3264.94 --> 3269.049
if I'm causing that egg to move up then

3267.279 --> 3272.17
gravity's not you you're inferring

3269.049 --> 3274.059
gravity by way of inference but that's

3272.17 --> 3276.16
not within scientific method so that

3274.059 --> 3277.4500000000003
makes it pseudoscience because in

3276.16 --> 3279.1299999999997
scientific method

3277.45 --> 3281.47
cause is the thing the thing that you

3279.13 --> 3283.57
manipulate right the medium so if I make

3281.47 --> 3285.52
that egg move up it's not gravity doing

3283.57 --> 3286.81
it it's me doing it by changing the

3285.52 --> 3288.88
density and improving it within

3286.81 --> 3290.41
scientific method but if you're going to

3288.88 --> 3292.63
counter claim that it's actually gravity

3290.41 --> 3294.339
by inference that I'm going to say oh

3292.63 --> 3296.6800000000003
that's outside a suit that's outside a

3294.339 --> 3298.45
scientific method and pseudoscience how

3296.68 --> 3300.0989999999997
are you going to argue against that by

3298.45 --> 3302.41
applying scientific method in the car

3300.099 --> 3306.1600000000003
it's very easy to conceptualize though

3302.41 --> 3308.44
it it is easy I agree what book I'll put

3306.16 --> 3310.81
a poke you little because since you're

3308.44 --> 3316.119
on Golgo right so what they basically

3310.81 --> 3318.19
think happens looking for I understand

3316.119 --> 3320.829
their presupposition of gravity usually

3318.19 --> 3322.39
a lot better than most people right so

3320.829 --> 3324.28
what happens and they ain't even brought

3322.39 --> 3326.89
this for it forth in arguments when I

3324.28 --> 3330.73
was literally defending it and that is

3326.89 --> 3333.8199999999997
that the pressure by water or any liquid

3330.73 --> 3337.27
for example that doesn't disperse upward

3333.82 --> 3339.55
knows gas is all being subjected to a

3337.27 --> 3342.7599999999998
force disequilibrium that causes it to

3339.55 --> 3346.9
press against everything else including

3342.76 --> 3351.4500000000003
the egg in the water and it will push or

3346.9 --> 3353.849
pull it towards an average pressure

3351.45 --> 3358.0299999999997
system where it will find an equilibrium

3353.849 --> 3360.13
thanks to gravity well look at Daniel

3358.03 --> 3362.2900000000004
Lynch ah he says wryly you are assuming

3360.13 --> 3364.78
you are only changing one variable well

3362.29 --> 3366.369
guess what I am where's the other change

3364.78 --> 3367.9300000000003
because that's important if you're gonna

3366.369 --> 3370.0
say that I'm changing more than one

3367.93 --> 3372.5789999999997
variable then that requires evidence

3370.0 --> 3375.19
because I'm keeping the temperature the

3372.579 --> 3376.9900000000002
volumes the egg I'm keeping all them the

3375.19 --> 3378.64
same all I'm doing is increase in the

3376.99 --> 3380.7999999999997
density and I'm gonna measure the

3378.64 --> 3382.69
density of the water before and after to

3380.8 --> 3384.369
prove that I have changed the density of

3382.69 --> 3385.75
the water so if you're going to make an

3384.369 --> 3388.599
assertion that I've changed something

3385.75 --> 3392.23
else in addition to the density evidence

3388.599 --> 3394.06
is going to be required you are changing

3392.23 --> 3395.859
the weight of fluid therefore buoyancy

3394.06 --> 3396.7599999999998
no that's an inferred course that's

3395.859 --> 3398.68
pseudoscience

3396.76 --> 3400.69
you can't infer an additional course in

3398.68 --> 3402.49
scientific method the cause is the thing

3400.69 --> 3404.56
that I manipulate it's not the thing

3402.49 --> 3406.7799999999997
that you infer exists it's the thing

3404.56 --> 3409.359
that I manipulate so you're wrong right

3406.78 --> 3412.809
buoyancy and falling

3409.359 --> 3415.869
both this husband effects the other day

3412.809 --> 3420.6090000000004
I had two ballers in this course and I

3415.869 --> 3422.849
was uh debating them they really tried

3420.609 --> 3427.15
to tell me that even if you were to

3422.849 --> 3431.19
manipulate a cause and actually get that

3427.15 --> 3436.6600000000003
effect you can make a every single

3431.19 --> 3440.099
variable like ever so therefore you

3436.66 --> 3443.259
can't be concise with your experiment

3440.099 --> 3445.569
I'm just like what do you mean are you

3443.259 --> 3449.499
guys talking about me

3445.569 --> 3453.069
if I manipulate something and I get an

3449.499 --> 3456.069
effect I've just found a cause and

3453.069 --> 3460.66
they're like no no you you can never be

3456.069 --> 3464.319
100% sure of that because you can never

3460.66 --> 3466.479
take out every variable yeah well that's

3464.319 --> 3468.069
why we would repeat it that's how we

3466.479 --> 3469.3289999999997
peaked it and get the same result and

3468.069 --> 3471.099
they were over and over and again and

3469.329 --> 3472.9590000000003
then basically if they still don't

3471.099 --> 3474.849
accept that then that means that they

3472.959 --> 3476.68
reject site the scientific method and

3474.849 --> 3478.779
that makes them by that by doing that

3476.68 --> 3482.019
that makes them science deny is the

3478.779 --> 3485.529
thing that they criticize us for just

3482.019 --> 3487.779
like so what are we even doing if if you

3485.529 --> 3491.709
can't cow what I just did as a course

3487.779 --> 3493.839
you would after I get in fact what the

3491.709 --> 3506.799
hell are we doing here are you kidding

3493.839 --> 3511.449
I think but yeah you're making it all

3506.799 --> 3513.88
very complicated by demanding scientific

3511.449 --> 3516.279
evidence when yeah you know what you can

3513.88 --> 3519.4
just go with aberration it really works

3516.279 --> 3521.019
out every time so and you get to

3519.4 --> 3528.4
presuppose all these amazing things

3521.019 --> 3531.519
about outer space come on you know they

3528.4 --> 3533.9100000000003
really wanted to tell me that it's it

3531.519 --> 3538.959
could just be a coincidence

3533.91 --> 3542.259
so that oh I've got red herring on his

3538.959 --> 3543.22
hope in the water boils it just might be

3542.259 --> 3546.04
a coincidence

3543.22 --> 3550.0
that the water is boiling as I happen to

3546.04 --> 3551.859
turn on the stove it could just be a

3550.0 --> 3554.14
coincidence that I'm not the cause of

3551.859 --> 3557.25
that happening there were like no could

3554.14 --> 3560.44
just be I was like oh my god you guys

3557.25 --> 3561.7
okay yeah well this is where it gets

3560.44 --> 3562.599
interesting though because what I'll do

3561.7 --> 3564.0699999999997
at the end of mine is I'm gonna

3562.599 --> 3566.23
challenge anybody that disagrees with

3564.07 --> 3567.52
the results of this experiment because

3566.23 --> 3568.75
I'm gonna do it properly I'm gonna do it

3567.52 --> 3570.88
the way that they do it in science which

3568.75 --> 3572.89
is like and observe your phenomena which

3570.88 --> 3575.109
is like some things appear to sink some

3572.89 --> 3576.43
people some things appear to float it's

3575.109 --> 3578.02
difficult to work out I mean like a

3576.43 --> 3580.39
plane that crash lands on the ground on

3578.02 --> 3582.0099999999998
the water if it if it doesn't break up

3580.39 --> 3584.17
on entry and they kill it it stays

3582.01 --> 3587.44
intact the plane will float on the water

3584.17 --> 3588.4300000000003
despite weighing thousands of tons so

3587.44 --> 3590.619
it's like that seems to be

3588.43 --> 3591.8799999999997
counterintuitive well but buoyancy yeah

3590.619 --> 3593.08
all right you can explain the reasons

3591.88 --> 3595.81
why it occurs but the point is it's

3593.08 --> 3597.369
heavy but it seems to float but equally

3595.81 --> 3599.17
once you remove that amount of that

3597.369 --> 3601.06
volume from it and change its parameters

3599.17 --> 3602.83
or open a door or whatever and all the

3601.06 --> 3605.77
water from it meet then sinks quick

3602.83 --> 3607.93
right like an anchor so it's like hmm I

3605.77 --> 3610.599
wonder if under what's causing that but

3607.93 --> 3612.0099999999998
I suspect that in my example if I can

3610.599 --> 3614.77
get my egg to sit in neutral buoyancy

3612.01 --> 3616.7200000000003
and it's in the middle I can cause it by

3614.77 --> 3618.49
changing just a medium but the problem

3616.72 --> 3620.95
is bumper says that density is not

3618.49 --> 3623.3799999999997
forced he says that weight is a force

3620.95 --> 3625.66
but if I'm changing the density of the

3623.38 --> 3627.94
liquid then that is the cause in

3625.66 --> 3632.83
scientific method so he's got a direct

3627.94 --> 3635.7400000000002
clash with science it's so weird like if

3632.83 --> 3640.75
the weight is the forced and how how can

3635.74 --> 3643.24
you explain a helium balloon because

3640.75 --> 3645.28
that's not weight that's a lack of way

3643.24 --> 3647.1699999999996
it's basically causing it so it doesn't

3645.28 --> 3649.02
make any sense how can it be both weight

3647.17 --> 3652.839
and a lack of weight causing

3649.02 --> 3655.75
displacement well if there's a uniform

3652.839 --> 3659.23
force I mean if the air that we breathe

3655.75 --> 3661.51
is given a density of 1 which is the

3659.23 --> 3664.0
helium balloon has a density of 0.7 for

3661.51 --> 3666.01
example and you can tell that it's not

3664.0 --> 3667.42
gonna go down it's gonna go up I want to

3666.01 --> 3669.099
say up and down I don't mean them is in

3667.42 --> 3670.48
it's just gonna go to the place of less

3669.099 --> 3673.27
density because it's in a state of

3670.48 --> 3674.83
disequilibrium the balloon is though he

3673.27 --> 3676.64
limits in the balloon added the weight

3674.83 --> 3678.619
to the balloon of the blue

3676.64 --> 3680.1189999999997
is not in its place of neutrality it's

3678.619 --> 3683.059
not in its place of equilibrium it's

3680.119 --> 3685.2200000000003
being held by you old in it and out of

3683.059 --> 3686.69
equilibrium so when you let go of the

3685.22 --> 3689.2099999999996
balloon and it finds its level like

3686.69 --> 3691.21
smoke does once it levels out a lot of

3689.21 --> 3693.38
weight of zero it won't have any weight

3691.21 --> 3694.819
which is a big problem for them because

3693.38 --> 3696.559
they need everything to have a weight so

3694.819 --> 3697.819
that they can claim little G but if it

3696.559 --> 3699.079
has no weights because it's in neutral

3697.819 --> 3701.45
buoyancy then you've got a problem

3699.079 --> 3703.849
haven't it weight is always a derivative

3701.45 --> 3707.24
it's always a mechanical it is like

3703.849 --> 3708.92
measuring a temperature well you don't

3707.24 --> 3710.6299999999997
have to measure it with weight you can

3708.92 --> 3713.359
measure the density of the liquid there

3710.63 --> 3715.5190000000002
in my case with a particular counter and

3713.359 --> 3717.2
then basically you can claim weight if

3715.519 --> 3719.24
you want but that the thing is you

3717.2 --> 3721.3999999999996
you're gonna in your definition for

3719.24 --> 3723.819
weight you've got little g-well little

3721.4 --> 3727.549
gene requires evidence

3723.819 --> 3729.23
it requires evidence to prove that it to

3727.549 --> 3731.299
prove that it's justified and being

3729.23 --> 3732.71
there because we're saying that it isn't

3731.299 --> 3735.23
justified it be in there you could find

3732.71 --> 3737.9900000000002
it in an even more effective way in that

3735.23 --> 3740.48
is saying that weights depends on the

3737.99 --> 3743.99
medium the experience weight depends on

3740.48 --> 3747.319
the medium that the thing being weighed

3743.99 --> 3749.75
in is being weighted that's why I've

3747.319 --> 3752.21
said relative density for ages I ran

3749.75 --> 3756.14
indeed the density is all the same it is

3752.21 --> 3758.059
the volumetric mass isn't it [ __ ]

3756.14 --> 3761.509
anyway though because don't they based

3758.059 --> 3767.48
weight on the gravitational pull on an

3761.509 --> 3770.569
object yeah yeah was just a measure of

3767.48 --> 3774.049
magnitude right it's basically it's just

3770.569 --> 3776.96
it's just man quantifying something just

3774.049 --> 3780.0389999999998
like time it's arbitrary right wait like

3776.96 --> 3784.779
what is one right show me one one what

3780.039 --> 3787.4
right so you think if I met that unit of

3784.779 --> 3790.309
right and if I get on a scale and it's

3787.4 --> 3793.5190000000002
calibrated one way our way one weight

3790.309 --> 3795.17
and then I can get on a scale completely

3793.519 --> 3797.6899999999996
different that's calibrated in another

3795.17 --> 3799.64
way and I'll weigh something else so

3797.69 --> 3803.599
it's just whatever's going on in the

3799.64 --> 3806.029
contraption no no it's more dependent on

3803.599 --> 3808.279
work on your location on the pressure on

3806.029 --> 3810.02
the medium again if you're gonna weigh

3808.279 --> 3812.48
yourself

3810.02 --> 3814.369
at ground level then yeah you're gonna

3812.48 --> 3818.45
have a typical weight and if you then go

3814.369 --> 3820.9700000000003
up much higher higher higher lens or on

3818.45 --> 3825.3999999999996
a mountain you're probably way a little

3820.97 --> 3828.41
bit less because of the medium correct

3825.4 --> 3829.88
and we know that's true yeah we know

3828.41 --> 3831.589
that's true because if you get helium

3829.88 --> 3834.079
balloon and then you let go of it it'll

3831.589 --> 3835.849
rise up to the to this so it's an its

3834.079 --> 3837.98
place of neutrality without too much

3835.849 --> 3839.42
speed or aggression but you get that

3837.98 --> 3841.55
same helium balloon and then pull it

3839.42 --> 3843.05
underneath water and then let go of it

3841.55 --> 3845.9
it bursts out of there like a volcano

3843.05 --> 3848.329
you've changed the medium brakes it rips

3845.9 --> 3850.04
open the gas it depends on how big the

3848.329 --> 3852.05
blueness and how strong it is when you

3850.04 --> 3857.15
push it in there but if you can get the

3852.05 --> 3858.7400000000002
helium blue that's my point

3857.15 --> 3861.8
now that's my point so the fact

3858.74 --> 3863.18
absolutely if you changed it no no it

3861.8 --> 3864.8900000000003
depends on how much helium you put in

3863.18 --> 3867.29
the balloon it has a really strong

3864.89 --> 3868.8489999999997
balloon then like a seriously thick

3867.29 --> 3870.77
rubber balloon because if that's a

3868.849 --> 3875.1800000000003
regular balloon if you try to push it's

3870.77 --> 3876.559
gonna burst absolutely so so super curve

3875.18 --> 3878.1189999999997
says you won't measure weight because

3876.559 --> 3879.8900000000003
you'll see the weight change idiot no

3878.119 --> 3881.4500000000003
I'm not measuring weight because weights

3879.89 --> 3884.45
got little G in it and we're questioning

3881.45 --> 3886.7
little G I'm measuring and it is my

3884.45 --> 3888.77
hypothesis that this the density that's

3886.7 --> 3891.02
causing it and I'm gonna show that if I

3888.77 --> 3893.089
manipulate density then that's the cause

3891.02 --> 3895.4
but if you're gonna say actually you're

3893.089 --> 3897.74
changing the weight then because little

3895.4 --> 3900.4700000000003
G is in them in that weight mathematical

3897.74 --> 3903.14
construct that you're relying on maths

3900.47 --> 3906.109
is improving cause science proves cause

3903.14 --> 3907.97
my scientific experiments my prediction

3906.109 --> 3910.5789999999997
my hypothesis is that it's the density

3907.97 --> 3912.74
that's causing it and the weight thing

3910.579 --> 3914.299
is a concept that you're using that has

3912.74 --> 3916.339
no application in science whatsoever

3914.299 --> 3918.38
it's purely mathematical you put little

3916.339 --> 3920.75
G in there and we're questioning it well

3918.38 --> 3923.42
we're seeing what is the cause you infer

3920.75 --> 3925.19
an additional cause well I'm not

3923.42 --> 3927.65
inferring an additional cause to see

3925.19 --> 3929.51
what is the real cause for it and we all

3927.65 --> 3931.099
know what's going to happen so you guys

3929.51 --> 3933.4100000000003
are going to have to deny science your

3931.099 --> 3935.27
own scientific method to come up with an

3933.41 --> 3937.25
explanation for why it is that the egg

3935.27 --> 3938.99
doesn't do a what you'd expect it to do

3937.25 --> 3942.319
which would be be attracted towards the

3938.99 --> 3943.6099999999997
increase in mass and B why it moves in

3942.319 --> 3945.77
the first place B

3943.61 --> 3947.8700000000003
if there's a move in mass then you've

3945.77 --> 3949.73
got a force according to Newton and I

3947.87 --> 3952.58
don't even a scribe to Newton but that's

3949.73 --> 3955.46
what he says so if the if I change the

3952.58 --> 3957.62
density and the egg moves Newton says

3955.46 --> 3958.91
there's a force there scientific method

3957.62 --> 3961.16
states that is the density because

3958.91 --> 3963.74
that's what I changed and then you guys

3961.16 --> 3965.5099999999998
come and infer an alternative apply math

3963.74 --> 3968.0299999999997
to it and claim that I've got it wrong

3965.51 --> 3969.7400000000002
but mine's within scientific method

3968.03 --> 3973.03
yours is outside of it because you're

3969.74 --> 3976.52
inferring somewhere else so I'm right

3973.03 --> 3979.96
indeed oh you're at least scientifically

3976.52 --> 3983.39
more valid in your approach that's it

3979.96 --> 3985.16
they dismiss they've either got a

3983.39 --> 3986.66
dismissed scientific method and state

3985.16 --> 3987.95
that your independent variable is not

3986.66 --> 3990.6499999999996
your cause because you can infer

3987.95 --> 3992.27
alternative causes instead or they've

3990.65 --> 3994.7000000000003
got to accept that there are practicing

3992.27 --> 3996.2
fake science which is my point so it's

3994.7 --> 3998.48
not even about the egg it's just about

3996.2 --> 4000.3999999999996
how you interpret the course if I vary

3998.48 --> 4002.53
and manipulate the density and it makes

4000.4 --> 4004.03
the egg move then there's a force new

4002.53 --> 4005.53
and said there's a force then you guys

4004.03 --> 4008.32
have got to infer that there's an

4005.53 --> 4009.9700000000003
additional court force and I say that's

4008.32 --> 4012.1600000000003
when it falls outside of science because

4009.97 --> 4014.41
I've manipulated the cause you're

4012.16 --> 4019.0299999999997
inferring there's another cause you guys

4014.41 --> 4021.0099999999998
are fake science you even if we're not

4019.03 --> 4024.8700000000003
talking about the eggs something like an

4021.01 --> 4028.1800000000003
anvil floating around in mercury green

4024.87 --> 4030.19
yeah let's think I think is though if we

4028.18 --> 4031.87
do think with the gaggy is that it's

4030.19 --> 4034.03
repeatable by everybody at home without

4031.87 --> 4036.1
grabbing sabayon oh yeah I understand

4034.03 --> 4038.0800000000004
the simplicity of it but I'm saying like

4036.1 --> 4043.72
I mean something as heavy as an anvil

4038.08 --> 4046.81
and it can be a little round where is

4043.72 --> 4048.58
the force look super case a mercury is

4046.81 --> 4051.67
incredibly heavy as well by the way

4048.58 --> 4054.8199999999997
don't underestimate that look Zuma Cove

4051.67 --> 4056.5
say okay I'm saying that you've yeah

4054.82 --> 4059.32
look super curve is saying that you've

4056.5 --> 4060.91
manipulated the cause wait no no I've

4059.32 --> 4062.29
manipulated the density and I've

4060.91 --> 4064.39
measured out but I'll be measuring the

4062.29 --> 4065.5
density of the medium first then I'll be

4064.39 --> 4067.75
measuring the density of the medium

4065.5 --> 4071.02
second so that I can prove that I've

4067.75 --> 4073.18
changed the density wait isn't it cause

4071.02 --> 4075.0099999999998
it's a mathematical concept wait it

4073.18 --> 4077.049
doesn't have any bring out the

4075.01 --> 4079.029
derivative fix comes

4077.049 --> 4081.519
there's no such thing as weight because

4079.029 --> 4083.319
it's purely mathematical but what I can

4081.519 --> 4085.5389999999998
prove that I'm changing the density and

4083.319 --> 4087.999
that's not the weight a man remember my

4085.539 --> 4092.7090000000003
cause my presumed cause is density it's

4087.999 --> 4095.919
not weight we want to call whatever it's

4092.709 --> 4100.289
made out of that's what's causing it and

4095.919 --> 4103.839
this is why just words whatever it is

4100.289 --> 4106.449
it's lighter than the medium it's going

4103.839 --> 4108.73
to float or it's gonna rise let's look

4106.449 --> 4110.558999999999
at this that Daniels saying this is why

4108.73 --> 4111.159
your scientific method is affirming the

4110.559 --> 4114.25
consequent

4111.159 --> 4115.929
no what we're proving causation we're

4114.25 --> 4119.109
not affirming the consequent we're not

4115.929 --> 4121.329
we're not adding an inferred cause I'm

4119.109 --> 4123.009
manipulating one thing and scientific

4121.329 --> 4124.69
method says if that if you manipulate so

4123.009 --> 4126.13
many causes some it then that's cause

4124.69 --> 4127.9
and effect relationship and I'm going to

4126.13 --> 4130.719
demonstrate that but look at all the

4127.9 --> 4132.0689999999995
hatred that's coming through now so

4130.719 --> 4133.599
basically what this is doing is giving

4132.069 --> 4134.679
me the ability to anticipate the

4133.599 --> 4135.909000000001
[ __ ] that they're going to combat

4134.679 --> 4138.1900000000005
with so I can address it in the video

4135.909 --> 4140.739
and I might even turn comments off just

4138.19 --> 4142.329
because you lost so blinded by nonsense

4140.739 --> 4144.19
rhetoric that I don't even need the

4142.329 --> 4145.389
comments on it so I might just leave the

4144.19 --> 4148.469
comments off it on this video because

4145.389 --> 4153.13
there's no way yeah ma there's no

4148.469 --> 4154.809
pitchforks right now yeah yeah you guys

4153.13 --> 4157.63
don't like the scientific might better

4154.809 --> 4159.819
huh no they don't really have black how

4157.63 --> 4162.88
you'll be talking about science and the

4159.819 --> 4167.049
ball here we don't talk about the ball

4162.88 --> 4169.659000000001
that way super I mean people like Jim

4167.049 --> 4171.94
panda like to say that science like you

4169.659 --> 4174.579
would agree with Anthony that scientific

4171.94 --> 4180.009
method can't be used to prove curvature

4174.579 --> 4181.808999999999
yeah yeah so so super super curve says

4180.009 --> 4183.369
you're not a scientist are you well if

4181.809 --> 4185.17
you adhere to scientific method by

4183.369 --> 4187.5689999999995
definition that makes you a scientist

4185.17 --> 4190.17
it's when you don't adhere to scientific

4187.569 --> 4192.519
method that makes you a pseudo scientist

4190.17 --> 4197.829
scientist man you're not wearing a lab

4192.519 --> 4199.570000000001
coat lab coat you can borrow if you need

4197.829 --> 4201.73
a lab coat so I can add credibility to

4199.57 --> 4205.69
it is that what I write you gotta wear

4201.73 --> 4208.388999999999
glasses though oh not again I'm gonna

4205.69 --> 4210.339999999999
have to find myself a lab coat but Riley

4208.389 --> 4213.01
you'll also definitely need one

4210.34 --> 4217.81
does fix lack glasses like that would

4213.01 --> 4222.280000000001
mean I've got a god word you got to do a

4217.81 --> 4225.25
video from average I'm gonna have to do

4222.28 --> 4227.889
that through it and then you already

4225.25 --> 4229.75
have a are speaking for it so that would

4227.889 --> 4232.659000000001
that would be true wizard to read to see

4229.75 --> 4234.76
that if I out blur to it as well because

4232.659 --> 4237.429
the scientific videos always seem to be

4234.76 --> 4246.179
blurred and never sharp recorded very

4237.429 --> 4251.139
with a very old pizza box yeah hello VHS

4246.179 --> 4253.4800000000005
super 8 yeah there's probably like video

4251.139 --> 4255.06
converters just to be able to make

4253.48 --> 4257.5
videos look like that

4255.06 --> 4259.75
yeah there's filters and all the exact

4257.5 --> 4263.83
video editing programs and to make it

4259.75 --> 4267.699
look old if you really want to smash it

4263.83 --> 4270.429
up you put a bow tie on that that'll

4267.699 --> 4272.71
kill them just say just put a bow tie on

4270.429 --> 4282.4
just keep seeing signs they like the

4272.71 --> 4284.71
absent-minded professor so they want me

4282.4 --> 4286.8099999999995
to use scales to measure the increase in

4284.71 --> 4288.909
salt yeah but what you're gonna do is

4286.81 --> 4290.830000000001
infer an additional cause and that

4288.909 --> 4292.449
that's not what I'm measuring I'm

4290.83 --> 4293.86
measuring the density so I'm gonna

4292.449 --> 4296.169999999999
measure the density the way it says

4293.86 --> 4298.0
because my cause my presumed cause is

4296.17 --> 4300.429
density of the medium causes the

4298.0 --> 4302.469
displacement because it changes so what

4300.429 --> 4304.21
would scales be to help why would scales

4302.469 --> 4305.71
be helpful to me in that instance they

4304.21 --> 4306.94
wouldn't would be I'm not measuring the

4305.71 --> 4311.949
density of the water then I'm measuring

4306.94 --> 4315.129999999999
the weight weighting you add the weight

4311.949 --> 4320.888999999999
and look or the weight increase displace

4315.13 --> 4323.46
da you could do that if you want to do

4320.889 --> 4325.78
ya what make us faint anymore though

4323.46 --> 4327.28
yeah cuz you're not measuring the thing

4325.78 --> 4328.929
that you've manipulated you're measuring

4327.28 --> 4330.82
the overall weight of the glass with the

4328.929 --> 4332.139
water and then the salt in it well

4330.82 --> 4333.4
that's not giving you the thing that

4332.139 --> 4335.17
you're actually testing is it I'm

4333.4 --> 4338.909
testing the density of that not the

4335.17 --> 4338.909
weight of the water the density of

4340.23 --> 4343.9
Daniel says affirming the consequent no

4342.55 --> 4346.24
it's denying the consequent

4343.9 --> 4347.469999999999
let's deny in the method as well I can't

4346.24 --> 4350.23
believe the [ __ ] they're trying to

4347.47 --> 4351.1900000000005
say in chat right now yeah so these are

4350.23 --> 4352.99
the things that I'll have to address

4351.19 --> 4356.32
because these are actually giving me the

4352.99 --> 4360.429999999999
counter arguments so this is great this

4356.32 --> 4364.12
is great homeless by they show my hat

4360.43 --> 4371.56
though okay because maybe because Nathan

4364.12 --> 4374.68
hasn't started up a hunger debates today

4371.56 --> 4376.150000000001
let you know of guys what he normally is

4374.68 --> 4380.740000000001
but he's not sent a link let me just

4376.15 --> 4381.879999999999
check him out on know he's live already

4380.74 --> 4384.37
yes

4381.88 --> 4388.45
oh hey yes but he's only just sent the

4384.37 --> 4390.67
link oh no 13 24 lease enter he's live

4388.45 --> 4394.84
already what okay

4390.67 --> 4397.24
didn't see that yeah sure let's see

4394.84 --> 4401.97
let's see how we need it if we're not

4397.24 --> 4401.969999999999
needed we'll stay but if he's out if he

4403.26 --> 4413.8
offers is it okay if you guys want to

4409.96 --> 4414.82
bother him then suppose is talking but I

4413.8 --> 4419.17
don't think there's anybody else in

4414.82 --> 4420.759999999999
there mmm-hmm but I can't wait so

4419.17 --> 4422.62
basically these guys the biggest

4420.76 --> 4424.900000000001
criticism is gonna be why didn't use

4422.62 --> 4426.72
scales and measure the weight yeah well

4424.9 --> 4429.28
we know the reason why that is don't we

4426.72 --> 4431.860000000001
because you can then infer an additional

4429.28 --> 4433.42
cause that doesn't pre exist and the

4431.86 --> 4435.67
scientific method stops you from doing

4433.42 --> 4437.41
that so I can't measure weights cannot

4435.67 --> 4439.6
because you literally call little G or

4437.41 --> 4442.18
Melissa so we calculate for it I want to

4439.6 --> 4443.77
measure the actual presumed cause the

4442.18 --> 4445.18
density that's why I'm not going to

4443.77 --> 4447.1
measure because I'm not measuring the

4445.18 --> 4453.43
overall weight because that allows you

4447.1 --> 4458.530000000001
to infer extra [ __ ] right though

4453.43 --> 4460.27
right hmm sorry it's right if I if I

4458.53 --> 4461.62
measure weight that just opens the door

4460.27 --> 4463.900000000001
to them to then claim that there's an

4461.62 --> 4465.82
additional force but then science

4463.9 --> 4467.379999999999
stops stops I immediately and says no

4465.82 --> 4469.42
because your your actual cause is the

4467.38 --> 4471.16
thing that you manipulate so I can't use

4469.42 --> 4475.21
weight because it immediately makes the

4471.16 --> 4476.65
result pseudoscience right because then

4475.21 --> 4482.409
you would have to prove grav

4476.65 --> 4485.199
first yeah and you do you can't write

4482.409 --> 4487.75
yeah that's what I kind of learned to

4485.199 --> 4492.669999999999
appreciate appreciate about the relative

4487.75 --> 4496.719
density theory proven theory and that it

4492.67 --> 4498.58
is so closed looped it is tight Daniel

4496.719 --> 4502.54
says measure the pressure to the

4498.58 --> 4505.63
pressure on fine there is more to it but

4502.54 --> 4508.659
it's just not relevant to the actual

4505.63 --> 4510.88
scientific method process and I like

4508.659 --> 4513.489
that about it so there's things a lot

4510.88 --> 4515.650000000001
more to talk about so the tuning wheel

4513.489 --> 4519.099999999999
theory but it just works it's really

4515.65 --> 4521.679
tight yeah best part about is it's a

4519.1 --> 4523.96
real thing and they've read that it's

4521.679 --> 4528.1
real thing it's just that need this

4523.96 --> 4531.1
outside force or bending of space-time

4528.1 --> 4534.34
what about how you want to call it you

4531.1 --> 4540.969
know satisfy their orbital mechanics you

4534.34 --> 4542.71
know exactly at the same reason my pen

4540.969 --> 4544.69
falls to the foot was the same reason

4542.71 --> 4547.2390000000005
that moon is up there like hit the

4544.69 --> 4551.919999999999
holiday but it's not just up there it

4547.239 --> 4556.2699999999995
falls perpetually right yeah that always

4551.92 --> 4558.64
made so much sense to me not it's like

4556.27 --> 4563.35
how do you perpetually fall around

4558.64 --> 4565.63
something that's just so super super

4563.35 --> 4567.400000000001
curved says why are you ignoring what we

4565.63 --> 4569.4400000000005
say will float the egg you're not

4567.4 --> 4571.719
disproving us I've designed thousand

4569.44 --> 4574.15
experiments listen to you listen super

4571.719 --> 4575.65
curved scientific method states that the

4574.15 --> 4578.139999999999
independent variable is the thing that

4575.65 --> 4580.87
causes an effect right it's that simple

4578.14 --> 4583.659000000001
I think that the density causes the

4580.87 --> 4585.64
displacement if I change the density and

4583.659 --> 4587.589999999999
it causes displacement it's got nothing

4585.64 --> 4589.900000000001
to do with weight do you not understand

4587.59 --> 4591.07
why weight doesn't apply now if you

4589.9 --> 4593.379999999999
don't understand why weight doesn't

4591.07 --> 4595.36
apply I'll say it again weight has got

4593.38 --> 4597.400000000001
little G in it a mathematical construct

4595.36 --> 4599.32
that you guys calculate and adjust for

4597.4 --> 4602.11
something that we're questioning exists

4599.32 --> 4604.54
in the first place and if I account for

4602.11 --> 4607.599999999999
or if I measure using scales the weight

4604.54 --> 4610.479
then you guys will then see use that as

4607.6 --> 4612.579000000001
a permission to infer an additional call

4610.479 --> 4614.7390000000005
but scientific method doesn't allow you

4612.579 --> 4615.969
to do that scientific method states that

4614.739 --> 4618.489
your cause is the thing that you

4615.969 --> 4620.679
manipulated well i manipulated the

4618.489 --> 4623.199
density so that's the value that you

4620.679 --> 4626.639
need to know not the weight the density

4623.199 --> 4626.638999999999
because that's my presumed cause

4634.269 --> 4639.400000000001
where there's a whole lot of crying

4635.92 --> 4641.1990000000005
going on in chat yeah Daniel says you're

4639.4 --> 4643.138999999999
manipulating multiple variables like the

4641.199 --> 4645.428999999999
pressure differential to be honest

4643.139 --> 4647.079
there's my have a point no but I don't

4645.429 --> 4649.15
know whether adapt whether it could ever

4647.079 --> 4651.46
be proven with like stuff that I could

4649.15 --> 4654.159
buy over the counter cos the increase in

4651.46 --> 4655.749
pressure will be like so small if Daniel

4654.159 --> 4657.098999999999
if you can make a suggestion for what I

4655.749 --> 4659.769
could do to measure the pressure

4657.099 --> 4661.929
variation difference then I'll consider

4659.769 --> 4663.67
it if it's not like cost prohibitive

4661.929 --> 4665.05
because I'm not allowed to spend any

4663.67 --> 4668.289
money on Flat Earth until Christmas

4665.05 --> 4669.639
table I had I've had a couple of fights

4668.289 --> 4672.599
with the missus over wasting money on

4669.639 --> 4674.650000000001
fliers so I've agreed that my my

4672.599 --> 4679.21
punishment is that I'll spend any money

4674.65 --> 4681.73
no more eggs for you yeah how you gonna

4679.21 --> 4683.11
get the salt then yeah well we've got

4681.73 --> 4685.57
some in the cupboard so I've stolen it

4683.11 --> 4689.17
our shop is gonna have to cut down on

4685.57 --> 4690.73
the eggs and salt yeah yeah I'm alright

4689.17 --> 4692.32
with the eggs and salt I've got to sneak

4690.73 --> 4693.968999999999
but I mean it was only a fiver but I've

4692.32 --> 4695.86
got to buy this particular counter and

4693.969 --> 4697.2390000000005
there's to count the actual density of

4695.86 --> 4699.13
that to measure the density right it was

4697.239 --> 4700.959999999999
only a fiver and I'm not I can't I can't

4699.13 --> 4703.2390000000005
even tell her that I bought it and so I

4700.96 --> 4705.249
have to intercept it when it comes so

4703.239 --> 4706.718999999999
yeah basically I'm not allowed to spend

4705.249 --> 4708.159
any money on Flat Earth until Christmas

4706.719 --> 4710.289
that's the agreed position right and

4708.159 --> 4711.67
I've broke it already with a fiver well

4710.289 --> 4713.739
it's been like this for a few months but

4711.67 --> 4716.139
anyway doesn't matter point is and if

4713.739 --> 4717.879999999999
you can suggest a way of doing it Daniel

4716.139 --> 4720.13
the pressure in the water increases so

4717.88 --> 4722.2300000000005
fast with the increase in depth yeah so

4720.13 --> 4724.269
what though what that isn't being

4722.23 --> 4726.4
changed is it and if it is being changed

4724.269 --> 4727.929
by an assault my question to you is if

4726.4 --> 4729.67
you can suggest a method that is

4727.929 --> 4733.09
cost-effective that I can measure the

4729.67 --> 4734.679
increase in the and the pressure in if

4733.09 --> 4736.7390000000005
you it that I can measure the increase

4734.679 --> 4738.789
in pressure then I'll try and do it

4736.739 --> 4740.949
because I mean we're talking like

4738.789 --> 4743.349
minuscule amounts of pressure change and

4740.949 --> 4745.719
you although you raise a valid point I'm

4743.349 --> 4748.360000000001
gonna say how can I demonstrate that

4745.719 --> 4750.099
cost effectively I mean I don't mean

4748.36 --> 4753.489
your amount of pressure it all really

4750.099 --> 4756.1900000000005
depends on the density of the liquid the

4753.489 --> 4758.199
combined density so a look it's a very

4756.19 --> 4761.19
heavy like mercury

4758.199 --> 4764.678999999999
oh yeah pressure very registerable

4761.19 --> 4766.659
registerable pressure absolutely yeah

4764.679 --> 4767.9490000000005
well pressure is force over area there

4766.659 --> 4771.209
all right you can calculate

4767.949 --> 4773.65
but there are like pressure sensors

4771.209 --> 4775.119
shouldn't be like too expensive now for

4773.65 --> 4777.999
you yeah your low budget

4775.119 --> 4780.07
they'll probably do cost a little it's

4777.999 --> 4782.44
it's it's not that the pressure sensors

4780.07 --> 4784.209
don't exist is the it's how precise are

4782.44 --> 4787.329
they gonna be because the change in the

4784.209 --> 4792.099
pressure is gonna be minuscule what do

4787.329 --> 4794.889
you mean when you it's gonna be salt you

4792.099 --> 4795.610000000001
mean to water yeah no we'll increase

4794.889 --> 4797.59
pressure

4795.61 --> 4802.449
it's not gonna be miniature don't

4797.59 --> 4804.159000000001
underestimate it well don't overestimate

4802.449 --> 4806.199
it how do you know what you've been

4804.159 --> 4808.11
influenced it fans on how much salt

4806.199 --> 4811.36
you're gonna throw in there for starters

4808.11 --> 4815.139
okay but there's a good chance that

4811.36 --> 4818.32
it'll be become that adding salt as a

4815.139 --> 4820.2390000000005
lot of weight you can still use that

4818.32 --> 4822.789
mechanism to basically derive what's

4820.239 --> 4826.78
going on it's very easy right it pretty

4822.789 --> 4828.999
suppose and then figure out okay if I'm

4826.78 --> 4831.789
gonna add a kilo of salt which

4828.999 --> 4836.59
volumetric wise is not a lot and add

4831.789 --> 4839.199
that to a liter of water or more like

4836.59 --> 4841.329
eight liters or something yeah it's

4839.199 --> 4845.289
gonna make a lot of pressure difference

4841.329 --> 4847.63
definitely like because there's just a

4845.289 --> 4850.38
lot of weight at it it's like eight

4847.63 --> 4853.389
kilos and then another kilo is at it

4850.38 --> 4856.269
because a liter water happens to be a

4853.389 --> 4860.59
kilogram roughly on sea level pressure

4856.269 --> 4865.119000000001
as it were so it's gonna matter

4860.59 --> 4866.679
significantly so super curve saying

4865.119 --> 4869.409
there will be more pressure under the

4866.679 --> 4873.4
egg than a bull when you add salt true

4869.409 --> 4875.379999999999
but if if the assertion is that I'm

4873.4 --> 4877.03
adding more density to the medium and

4875.38 --> 4879.519
therefore the pressures going to

4877.03 --> 4881.409
increase how would that be proven to be

4879.519 --> 4883.659000000001
true because although the pressure may

4881.409 --> 4885.728999999999
increase in a knot I bet it may not have

4883.659 --> 4888.459
any effect on it or it may be negligible

4885.729 --> 4890.4400000000005
effect and it may well alright so it's

4888.459 --> 4893.44
not irrelevant it's not relevant to the

4890.44 --> 4895.299999999999
experiment it's not involved

4893.44 --> 4897.999
yeah there's pressure oh yeah there's a

4895.3 --> 4900.67
lot going on in the world now that's not

4897.999 --> 4901.42
knowing everything that's not buoyancy

4900.67 --> 4903.04
so

4901.42 --> 4904.6
Perko saying that's buoyancy it's not

4903.04 --> 4906.34
buoyancy what buoyancy is is the

4904.6 --> 4908.2300000000005
opposite of gravity gravity's pulling

4906.34 --> 4909.6990000000005
the salt down and there's an equal and

4908.23 --> 4911.44
opposite reaction which would be the egg

4909.699 --> 4912.82
moving up that's not what you're

4911.44 --> 4915.61
describing with an increase in pressure

4912.82 --> 4917.53
I don't think that for actually the

4915.61 --> 4919.36
pressure applies laterally here doesn't

4917.53 --> 4920.679
apply vertically does it would it change

4919.36 --> 4923.53
vertically over the only change

4920.679 --> 4927.1900000000005
laterally both at the bottom it would

4923.53 --> 4929.349999999999
take the full pressure the air up the

4927.19 --> 4930.419999999999
lesser the pressure becomes as it

4929.35 --> 4934.6900000000005
normally is

4930.42 --> 4936.63
that's a gradient effect basically so

4934.69 --> 4939.37
Daniel I'm looking for your claim for

4936.63 --> 4941.7390000000005
something that I can test or measure the

4939.37 --> 4943.48
pressure so if you can find me some

4941.739 --> 4944.949
pressure measuring device that would

4943.48 --> 4950.678999999999
allow me to do pressure in an open

4944.949 --> 4954.25
container pressure sensors yeah it's not

4950.679 --> 4955.78
like a stick you put it in something and

4954.25 --> 4958.949
you got a pressure sensor and with a

4955.78 --> 4961.239
wire towards your computer or whatever

4958.949 --> 4969.549999999999
yeah but I don't think you could

4961.239 --> 4972.849999999999
pressure sensors definitely exists there

4969.55 --> 4974.62
the nest seneschal part of a lot of

4972.85 --> 4979.29
industrial machinery and everything

4974.62 --> 4983.219
especially that use pneumatics or

4979.29 --> 4987.25
hydraulics absolutely pressure sensors

4983.219 --> 4992.83
so look into it they should be out there

4987.25 --> 4994.449
industrial quality buoyancy is literally

4992.83 --> 4995.89
defined as the pressure differential can

4994.449 --> 4997.66
have a citation for that please Daniel

4995.89 --> 4999.280000000001
on top of your recommendation for

4997.66 --> 5001.199
measuring the prep the pressure stop

4999.28 --> 5002.58
stop creating tangents Daniel you

5001.199 --> 5005.25
creating work for yourself by making

5002.58 --> 5006.2699999999995
assertions let's have the the link for

5005.25 --> 5008.04
some work that I can measure the

5006.27 --> 5009.719
pressure differential between the before

5008.04 --> 5011.07
and after position and let's have a

5009.719 --> 5012.75
definition for what you just said there

5011.07 --> 5013.98
buoyancy is literally defined as the

5012.75 --> 5016.13
pressure differential let's see that

5013.98 --> 5016.129999999999
please

5020.99 --> 5024.139999999999
[Music]

5030.589 --> 5037.369
I a cotton something obtained you plan

5033.319 --> 5039.109
on using Riley Wallace Ida right so

5037.369 --> 5042.3189999999995
buoyancy is defined by we are combat see

5039.109 --> 5044.569
Chuck and Wikipedia states that it's not

5042.319 --> 5046.339000000001
thrust or an upward force exerted by a

5044.569 --> 5049.189
fluid that opposes the weight of an

5046.339 --> 5051.109
immersed object in a column of fluid

5049.189 --> 5052.369000000001
pressure increases with depth as a

5051.109 --> 5055.159000000001
result of the weight of the overlying

5052.369 --> 5057.679
fluid this pressure at the bottom of

5055.159 --> 5059.598999999999
column of fluid is greater than at the

5057.679 --> 5061.099
top of the column similarly the pressure

5059.599 --> 5063.769
at the ball right so it is linking to

5061.099 --> 5067.129
connect the the pressure with it or am i

5063.769 --> 5070.099
changing the pressure now I might

5067.129 --> 5077.5689999999995
changing the density I am so that way if

5070.099 --> 5079.309
there's gonna be creating tube causes or

5077.569 --> 5080.899
without them did so what this is then

5079.309 --> 5084.109
gonna do not react well then you get a

5080.899 --> 5088.3
complex hypothesis and then I'll prove

5084.109 --> 5088.3
both as independent variables separately

5088.719 --> 5094.369
correct then you have yeah you wouldn't

5093.26 --> 5095.689
be able to do would you because as you

5094.369 --> 5105.379
increase the density the pressure would

5095.689 --> 5107.869000000001
start to increase too but the cause

5105.379 --> 5109.459
would still be the density the the

5107.869 --> 5113.199
effect would the pressure would be that

5109.459 --> 5113.199
the the pressure starts to increase

5113.649 --> 5122.329000000001
there there's a good point

5116.769 --> 5125.769
hold on how would you do that prevent

5122.329 --> 5128.808999999999
the pressure from becoming less no

5125.769 --> 5132.819
that's not gonna work it will

5128.809 --> 5132.819
unilaterally increase

5134.25 --> 5138.19
but if you increase the density and that

5136.69 --> 5139.989
therefore increases the pressure the

5138.19 --> 5147.129999999999
cause of the increase in pressure will

5139.989 --> 5148.989
be the density yes right so you were

5147.13 --> 5152.08
basically work it in there but you don't

5148.989 --> 5153.218999999999
have to there is still the direct cause

5152.08 --> 5156.179
there's no profit there's no profit

5153.219 --> 5158.62
there's no gravity in pressure is there

5156.179 --> 5160.87
well you can pressure suppose it to be

5158.62 --> 5165.79
the cause as I explained you earlier but

5160.87 --> 5168.88
you don't have to necessarily let's stop

5165.79 --> 5171.01
with the presupposing man it's an

5168.88 --> 5173.9490000000005
internal part of our opposition's

5171.01 --> 5176.679
religion religion religious structures

5173.949 --> 5179.199
so yeah if you want to talk with them

5176.679 --> 5181.75
and then you're gonna have to presuppose

5179.199 --> 5184.389999999999
a lot or you're gonna have to be very

5181.75 --> 5187.6
brutal like Nathan and just shout at

5184.39 --> 5192.1900000000005
them for their stupidity so I'm gonna

5187.6 --> 5195.159000000001
show just covers it No so if pressure is

5192.19 --> 5197.469
the force over area that will mean the

5195.159 --> 5199.87
force would be the density to split the

5197.469 --> 5201.7300000000005
density change that would force so force

5199.87 --> 5202.84
equals mass times acceleration right so

5201.73 --> 5205.36
you've got your mass the egg and it's

5202.84 --> 5207.400000000001
accelerate in those your force so the

5205.36 --> 5210.219
pressure is force mass times the egg

5207.4 --> 5211.929
over area right and so I don't really

5210.219 --> 5213.82
see that as a problem so what that would

5211.929 --> 5216.52
be all it means then is wouldn't it mean

5213.82 --> 5218.469
that the egg so as you increase the

5216.52 --> 5220.780000000001
density that would be a cause the effect

5218.469 --> 5223.0
will be the precious change displacing

5220.78 --> 5225.37
the egg so pressure would the change in

5223.0 --> 5227.969
pressure would be the dependent variable

5225.37 --> 5230.8
would make the call the effect

5227.969 --> 5233.2300000000005
independent variable or you could say it

5230.8 --> 5237.04
is the relative density disequilibrium

5233.23 --> 5240.61
of the egg in relation to its medium

5237.04 --> 5243.219
that has changed yeah relative to either

5240.61 --> 5245.58
and but yeah the relative density

5243.219 --> 5250.36
disequilibrium is more widespread

5245.58 --> 5251.8
applicable because okay so when I get

5250.36 --> 5253.33
the wording of it right at the beginning

5251.8 --> 5255.76
because I forget the word in right at

5253.33 --> 5257.32
the beginning then there is there really

5255.76 --> 5258.67
is no work because then that they worded

5257.32 --> 5262.42
to get the gravity from land it's only

5258.67 --> 5264.9890000000005
when they use weight then isn't it but

5262.42 --> 5268.08
yeah we're just conveniently has it in

5264.989 --> 5271.44
sneaky so we use mass instead so okay so

5268.08 --> 5277.19
the relative mass of the density of the

5271.44 --> 5285.179999999999
liquid is X yeah that's okay I get it

5277.19 --> 5286.62
aha see ya it's all to do without a fine

5285.18 --> 5288.33
job that's the meaning of words and

5286.62 --> 5293.34
introduce this word wait that's got

5288.33 --> 5295.65
matter with it well it is has been

5293.34 --> 5297.96
colloquial I stood like they took these

5295.65 --> 5301.0199999999995
pseudoscience and then made it part of

5297.96 --> 5304.71
them of the word spectrum of common

5301.02 --> 5308.13
speech through schooling and through

5304.71 --> 5310.68
media so yes science has been widely

5308.13 --> 5315.900000000001
colloquial eyes and made into a culture

5310.68 --> 5320.43
and Western modern Earth they adapt this

5315.9 --> 5322.679999999999
culture in their words naturally that

5320.43 --> 5325.9800000000005
they don't even notice it too much it's

5322.68 --> 5327.96
just become normal that's how it's just

5325.98 --> 5330.69
that they've associated the word gravity

5327.96 --> 5336.2
with some force that comes from under

5330.69 --> 5342.36
our feet that's your problem

5336.2 --> 5345.45
fools you in right so that they could

5342.36 --> 5353.299999999999
keep us spinning on a freakin water ball

5345.45 --> 5353.3
flying around into space yep

5353.32 --> 5359.49
you should really watch that movie that

5355.51 --> 5363.79
I watched on Netflix the wondering earth

5359.49 --> 5365.29
if you ever seen that chocolate or no I

5363.79 --> 5368.2
think you would find it absolutely

5365.29 --> 5373.0
hilarious you would probably be laughing

5368.2 --> 5376.47
all throughout the entire movie on

5373.0 --> 5379.539
Netflix yeah it's pretty fresh

5376.47 --> 5379.539000000001
[Music]

5379.89 --> 5388.6
see how long I could sit through it it's

5385.15 --> 5390.429999999999
gonna have some real tough moments all

5388.6 --> 5391.870000000001
right should we go in support Nathan

5390.43 --> 5393.280000000001
cause he's got half an hour to go and I

5391.87 --> 5394.8099999999995
feel as though were working against him

5393.28 --> 5397.2699999999995
by being with you I mean and you're half

5394.81 --> 5399.01
an hour over our knee right yeah but I

5397.27 --> 5403.51
do have a little bit of vengeance to

5399.01 --> 5405.22
take for him always always I win and

5403.51 --> 5408.88
everybody else can just interrupt but

5405.22 --> 5409.39
does not mean oh no it's not you it's

5408.88 --> 5411.01
nobody

5409.39 --> 5412.360000000001
everybody else has led to show when he's

5411.01 --> 5413.9800000000005
on her when he's look when he's raising

5412.36 --> 5416.44
his voice and he's getting excited just

5413.98 --> 5422.98
leave him to it everybody else has got

5416.44 --> 5424.78
that bit you're learning it like I just

5422.98 --> 5428.799999999999
it's all right I just don't like it

5424.78 --> 5432.13
I know times he just gets unnecessarily

5428.8 --> 5436.03
harsh and he does it with wrong things

5432.13 --> 5437.59
so he uses mess he starts to use Mesmer

5436.03 --> 5442.24
in his moments of victory and I don't

5437.59 --> 5444.16
appreciate that so I don't know it's my

5442.24 --> 5449.349999999999
principal's kind of forced me to

5444.16 --> 5451.95
intervene I don't know anyway yes I

5449.35 --> 5456.490000000001
agree little run out to hang out so

5451.95 --> 5458.139999999999
yummy sorry right ladies guys all right

5456.49 --> 5461.71
see you later Riley thanks for joining

5458.14 --> 5469.83
are you cool on you can always come back

5461.71 --> 5472.18
and add a letter here are you over there

5469.83 --> 5474.91
all right Chelsea you later

5472.18 --> 5478.51
have a good day shower later Karen oh

5474.91 --> 5480.96
thanks for coming later chocolate

5478.51 --> 5480.96
Arwen

5481.05 --> 5492.6
all right oink so yeah it was a good

5489.24 --> 5496.86
show again I love it when yeah when

5492.6 --> 5498.39
people get on my panel together and yeah

5496.86 --> 5501.179999999999
it was good it was a good discussion

5498.39 --> 5504.18
with Riley I like to get into he likes

5501.18 --> 5506.76
to presuppose some things and I like

5504.18 --> 5508.59
that he likes to do that because I can

5506.76 --> 5511.2
join him then and then we can really box

5508.59 --> 5513.3
around with the presuppositions and the

5511.2 --> 5517.23
mechanics of it I do appreciate that's

5513.3 --> 5519.6900000000005
like a nice interesting hobby so yeah

5517.23 --> 5521.5199999999995
thanks everyone for coming in chat also

5519.69 --> 5526.139999999999
and all the ballers that have been

5521.52 --> 5529.56
trying to get some kind of influence but

5526.14 --> 5532.02
especially my loyal followers that

5529.56 --> 5533.0
always get here very much appreciate to

5532.02 --> 5539.160000000001
see you again

5533.0 --> 5541.71
and yeah if you like the video then up

5539.16 --> 5543.78
fold it and if you haven't already

5541.71 --> 5545.37
subscribed to my channel and hit the

5543.78 --> 5548.509999999999
bell notification so you know when I'm

5545.37 --> 5555.36
going life which is normally 2 p.m.

5548.51 --> 5559.17
Amsterdam time if you can spare some

5555.36 --> 5563.429999999999
then please donate to my super chat or

5559.17 --> 5565.53
directly to the paypal and also you can

5563.43 --> 5567.77
become part of my patreon you know helps

5565.53 --> 5571.17
out it helps me progress the show and

5567.77 --> 5573.81
yeah it's definitely good motivator to

5571.17 --> 5579.63
keep on going to know that I'm doing it

5573.81 --> 5581.910000000001
for for more than just myself in for my

5579.63 --> 5586.4400000000005
own amusement as it were anyway

5581.91 --> 5588.09
yeah begging begging that's right you

5586.44 --> 5590.4
know I don't want to live in poverty

5588.09 --> 5594.6
forever I mean kind of trying to do this

5590.4 --> 5598.23
with an end goal of not being totally

5594.6 --> 5603.18
poor and just wasting my time so thank

5598.23 --> 5607.25
you that right I will be back tomorrow

5603.18 --> 5610.71
with flattered early-bird number 183 and

5607.25 --> 5612.61
I'm gonna see if I'm can pop by Flat

5610.71 --> 5618.19
Earth debates that are still that are

5612.61 --> 5622.11
already going for half an hour and yeah

5618.19 --> 5629.169999999999
until the next early bird show keep it

5622.11 --> 5660.469999999999
flat and enjoy the nice spring Sun

5629.17 --> 5660.47
