120.659 --> 126.84

right at least they could pick it up and

126.84 --> 131.879
actually show you something with it

128.88 --> 134.879
without it just breaking on everything

131.879 --> 137.72
touch right but yeah this thing can

134.879 --> 140.28
barely pick up any detail

137.72 --> 144.84
so yeah

140.28 --> 148.52

2266.8 --> 2271.6600000000003

2269.56 --> 2274.06
known and has a channel and his own

2271.66 --> 2276.7599999999998
camera has their own shows

that isn't a trollish mood like trying

to poke somebody that's different

2278.2 --> 2282.3999999999996

2282.4 --> 2287.859
right it's like trying to make beef or

2285.88 --> 2291.42
something it's different from trolling

2287.859 --> 2291.42
an anonymous piece of [ __ ]

these trolls the ones that do that

2304.359 --> 2309.94
anonymously they can be traced

service equipment they can just figure

2317.44 --> 2322.119
out who you are

2319.06 --> 2324.52
it should be checked I'm like oh you're

2322.119 --> 2326.2000000000003
literally just doing that making other

just a stupid job no social life or no

well those people should be

2344.619 --> 2349.78
institutionalized

2391.3 --> 2395.92
walkie-talkies

2392.859 --> 2398.3199999999997
right no internet

2395.92 --> 2402.359
just get these [ __ ] trolls in the

2398.32 --> 2402.3590000000004
institutions to wean off

2403.66 --> 2410.2599999999998
their stupid trolling so they just

2406.18 --> 2412.18
cannot Escape into doing that so they

2410.26 --> 2414.1600000000003
have to face themselves and then they

2412.18 --> 2415.839
have to face each other right because

2414.16 --> 2419.2
they're going to be bumping into each

2415.839 --> 2421.359
other in that institution continually

2419.2 --> 2422.7999999999997
as they cannot get on their internet and

2421.359 --> 2424.66
they're going to be asked oh you got the

2422.8 --> 2427.119
internet dude they're going to make up a

2424.66 --> 2429.64
whole bunch of rumors even about how

2427.119 --> 2433.48
somebody secretly has internet and then

2429.64 --> 2435.339
make Ponzi schemes trying to lure others

2433.48 --> 2437.92
other troll

2435.339 --> 2440.44
people that are stuck there into

2437.92 --> 2442.48
believing that they could get access to

2440.44 --> 2444.4
Internet when they can't and then

2442.48 --> 2447.4
they'll pay money to those so that's

2444.4 --> 2450.64
dude it's all gonna go down all of it

2447.4 --> 2454.1800000000003
but I really think that these Anonymous

2450.64 --> 2456.7799999999997
pieces [ __ ] troll types should be

2454.18 --> 2459.339
officially medically

2456.78 --> 2462.1600000000003
institutionalized because they are a

2459.339 --> 2464.14
burden on society as a whole

2462.16 --> 2466.68
and every part of it

2464.14 --> 2466.68
yeah

2466.96 --> 2472.48
it's not about their

2469.54 --> 2474.22
personal expression

2472.48 --> 2476.7
because then you wouldn't have to be

2474.22 --> 2476.7
anonymous

2478.06 --> 2482.98
it's they're doing it to make other

2480.28 --> 2485.2000000000003
people miserable

2482.98 --> 2488.98
that's not that shouldn't be allowed

2485.2 --> 2491.7599999999998
that behavior should be punished

2488.98 --> 2491.76
foreign

2492.52 --> 2497.44
but yeah there's no point in you can't

2494.859 --> 2500.859
just go in hunting trolls and killing

2497.44 --> 2503.079
them that's not reasonable but you could

2500.859 --> 2505.119
make a policy to put them in

2503.079 --> 2507.94
institutions where they do not have

2505.119 --> 2509.079
access to the internet I mean it

2507.94 --> 2510.64
wouldn't it would almost be

2509.079 --> 2513.1600000000003
therapeutical it's not like they're

2510.64 --> 2514.839
gonna be like all medicated because it's

2513.16 --> 2516.8199999999997
not like an institution for the

2514.839 --> 2519.339
violently insane

2516.82 --> 2524.52
right a real serious mental institution

2519.339 --> 2527.619
no it's a troll Internet troll Institute

2524.52 --> 2530.56
specifically for that for weak people

2527.619 --> 2532.6800000000003
not for violently insane people for weak

2530.56 --> 2532.68
people

2533.2 --> 2544.4689999999996
that need to be weaned off the internet

2536.18 --> 2544.469
[Music]

2558.82 --> 2561.599
foreign

2563.26 --> 2568.78
and I think that everybody would run

2566.079 --> 2571.48
pretty nervous when they realize how

2568.78 --> 2572.44
many of these types of weenie people are

2571.48 --> 2576.339
out there

2572.44 --> 2578.56
I mean in some city regions it might be

2576.339 --> 2580.48
as bad as to like

2578.56 --> 2584.5789999999997
30 percent

2580.48 --> 2587.56
yeah I said it 30 of literally everybody

2584.579 --> 2589.3590000000004
that includes people that well have

2587.56 --> 2592.2999999999997
families even

2589.359 --> 2595.119
and that are just so cocked so

2592.3 --> 2597.2200000000003
have so much lack of maneuver socially

2595.119 --> 2599.26
in how they can compose themselves how

2597.22 --> 2602.2
they can impress Express themselves that

2599.26 --> 2603.5200000000004
they just have to be secret pieces [ __ ]

2602.2 --> 2605.68
trolls

2603.52 --> 2609.66
outside of that

2605.68 --> 2609.66
most people too should be

2609.88 --> 2612.599
picked up

2613.72 --> 2618.0989999999997
and said like yeah we've caught you

2616.9 --> 2620.8
trolling

2618.099 --> 2624.819
you're a drain on society

2620.8 --> 2625.96
you're gonna go to The Institute now

2624.819 --> 2628.3
right

2625.96 --> 2630.88
and hey they could have visitors

2628.3 --> 2633.819
just not any visitors that have

2630.88 --> 2635.079
smartphones with them huh

2633.819 --> 2638.02
yeah

2635.079 --> 2642.28
then you can actually learn to face

2638.02 --> 2645.099
people again to actually be forced to

2642.28 --> 2649.0600000000004
stand up for yourself in the physical

2645.099 --> 2652.06
real world face-to-face situation yeah

2649.06 --> 2654.22
no longer escaping in your stupid little

2652.06 --> 2656.2599999999998
mobile

2654.22 --> 2657.7599999999998
because you can't deal with anything no

2656.26 --> 2661.42
you're gonna have to face it you're

2657.76 --> 2664.6600000000003
gonna have to face what you really are

2661.42 --> 2668.26
and then actively let go of all the

2664.66 --> 2670.54
miserable ways you look at yourself to

2668.26 --> 2673.6600000000003
reinforce that position

2670.54 --> 2675.579
to be that terrible but you don't have

2673.66 --> 2677.94
to be that terrible

2675.579 --> 2682.42
is you projecting it onto yourself

2677.94 --> 2685.7200000000003
keeping you like that keeping you weak

2682.42 --> 2689.26
and thereby always having that troll

2685.72 --> 2691.7799999999997
Escape at you like oh you know you can't

2689.26 --> 2695.0200000000004
do this oh okay but I can make their

2691.78 --> 2697.5400000000004
lives miserable oh yes because I have no

2695.02 --> 2700.78
control over my life so I'm gonna make

2697.54 --> 2703.599
their lives miserable yeah

2700.78 --> 2704.7000000000003
that's what you do trolls and you should

2703.599 --> 2707.1400000000003
be

2704.7 --> 2710.2
systematically institutionalized for

2707.14 --> 2713.0789999999997
that behavior Secret Service should

2710.2 --> 2715.72
give you notifications like yeah we

2713.079 --> 2720.2400000000002
caught you trolling over this past time

2715.72 --> 2720.24
this much and this bad

2722.319 --> 2727.9
yeah either you have to stop or you're

2725.2 --> 2731.9199999999996
gonna be institutionalized

2727.9 --> 2733.3
and like let's say starting with a month

2731.92 --> 2735.819
right

2733.3 --> 2737.5600000000004
and you can't even you can't like say oh

2735.819 --> 2739.599
we're gonna cut off your internet then

2737.56 --> 2741.52
because that will literally blow up

2739.599 --> 2743.38
businesses Etc

2741.52 --> 2746.92
can't do that no that's why those people

2743.38 --> 2750.819
have to be taken away

2746.92 --> 2753.76
to a special place

2750.819 --> 2756.64
for troll

2753.76 --> 2759.0400000000004
freaks yeah for for mentally insane

2756.64 --> 2761.92
people that are have troll behavior that

2759.04 --> 2764.079
can't stop to wean them off it and to

2761.92 --> 2766.359
basically force them

2764.079 --> 2769.02
to learn what it is to be a normal human

2766.359 --> 2769.02
being again

2777.819 --> 2783.42
I think that would probably

2780.819 --> 2783.42
help

2783.7 --> 2789.54
in this world where the Internet is just

2786.22 --> 2789.54
getting worse and worse

2790.48 --> 2797.44
Ada Studio 68 Happy New Year

2793.66 --> 2801.0989999999997
remember projection oh yes

2797.44 --> 2803.98
Mega projection sure because I just go

2801.099 --> 2808.3590000000004
around anonymously and whine in people's

2803.98 --> 2810.359
chats all day that's projection right or

2808.359 --> 2813.88
when is the one that should be

2810.359 --> 2816.04
institutionalized for trolling

2813.88 --> 2818.619
yes

2816.04 --> 2822.24
because that makes a lot of sense with

2818.619 --> 2822.2400000000002
everything I just explained

2841.78 --> 2846.6400000000003

2872.44 --> 2874.7400000000002
long time

2886.0 --> 2891.339
right so yeah it's another webcam it's a

2888.88 --> 2894.4
shitty webcam this is the resolution

2891.339 --> 2898.06
it's not even out of focus this is it

2894.4 --> 2901.9
yeah this is like a 360.

2898.06 --> 2906.339
resolution webcam made in China

2901.9 --> 2908.5
yeah bought for two Euros like 15 years

2906.339 --> 2911.2
ago okay

2908.5 --> 2914.74
this is potentially the worst camera

2911.2 --> 2916.98
that is still working and in use in the

2914.74 --> 2916.9799999999996
world

2918.579 --> 2923.079
unless somebody like has somebody that's

2920.98 --> 2924.4
like on that's like a black and white

2923.079 --> 2926.44
thing

2924.4 --> 2928.9
but yeah

2926.44 --> 2930.76
I mean you can't get a worse webcam than

2928.9 --> 2934.96
this and there's nothing I can do about

2930.76 --> 2937.3
it for today's show but tomorrow I will

2934.96 --> 2940.8
try to get a new one

2937.3 --> 2940.8
that doesn't suck

2965.02 --> 2967.92
what settings

2968.26 --> 2971.5
I don't know what you're talking about

2970.0 --> 2974.64
serious

2971.5 --> 2974.64
what settings

2995.98 --> 3002.96
there's there's no options

2998.98 --> 3002.96
on this thing at all

3005.64 --> 3010.3799999999997
but yeah I get it it does seem like it's

3008.22 --> 3013.14
sort of out of focus a bit

3010.38 --> 3016.92
it's weird but it's it's not it's it's

3013.14 --> 3018.1189999999997
just shitty it's always shitty like this

3016.92 --> 3020.04
see

3018.119 --> 3021.7200000000003
it's not much of a difference it's out

3020.04 --> 3023.2799999999997
of focus everywhere it's just because

3021.72 --> 3025.74
the background

3023.28 --> 3028.619
is really still

3025.74 --> 3030.839
that it just seems it's more in focus it

3028.619 --> 3033.319
isn't it's just as shitty as the

seem to be like options they were not

3080.88 --> 3083.359
clickable

3089.339 --> 3094.4
to download the driver for it oh [ __ ]

3094.579 --> 3098.54
you might have a point there

3106.2 --> 3110.2799999999997
this is an old thing that should be just

3107.819 --> 3111.48
it should be self-installing Plug and

blabbering about

3483.119 --> 3486.8
you literally made that up

that you don't get some stupid riddle

3495.66 --> 3501.72
after death and then if you get it wrong

3497.94 --> 3504.7200000000003
you like yeah you get it yeah after

3501.72 --> 3507.5989999999997
death you don't do some stupid flip coin

3504.72 --> 3510.2999999999997

that's not how it [ __ ] works anybody

their minds

3514.74 --> 3518.4199999999996
it's absolutely illogical

3529.98 --> 3535.02
when you're dead yeah when you're not in

the physical world anymore the direction

doesn't mean anything

3539.579 --> 3545.1800000000003
physical space doesn't mean anything

3545.88 --> 3551.46
because you're dead

3547.98 --> 3552.66
you're delivered to the virtual to the

spiritual

3552.66 --> 3557.46
directions don't mean anything it

3555.359 --> 3561.119
directions will only be meaning

something that they mean to your memory

3561.119 --> 3565.859
as a person that's the only thing it

3563.52 --> 3568.2
will mean to you after that so it's

absolute horseshit what you saying at

they told you about that did they

after they came back in their body so

3607.02 --> 3614.819
they didn't actually die it's called a

3610.68 --> 3618.4199999999996
near death experience it's not the

3614.819 --> 3621.42
actual death experience because actual

3618.42 --> 3624.2400000000002
death experience is a one-way experience

listening to other people's visions and

then accepting that for

3677.46 --> 3683.46
for truth just like that at smack

3680.88 --> 3685.799
so you bought into a story

3683.46 --> 3688.2

absolutely reality and

3688.2 --> 3694.9399999999996
tackling it mechanically to reify this

3691.619 --> 3694.94
is really dumb thing to do

3695.819 --> 3704.119
the afterlife is extremely personal

3699.72 --> 3704.1189999999997

near-death experiences is not a death

experience it's a mere death experience

3722.46 --> 3729.0
they're not actually dead

3729.0 --> 3734.339

3770.18 --> 3775.319
iron course as near as you're gonna get

3773.22 --> 3776.5789999999997
but we're still gonna assume it it's

3775.319 --> 3780.079
still there even though it wasn't

3776.579 --> 3780.079
successful yes

3783.18 --> 3789.7799999999997
no that's called wet finger work

3786.839 --> 3792.119
that's like oh we we didn't have the

3789.78 --> 3793.76
technology to get there we we couldn't

3792.119 --> 3797.7000000000003
make it

3793.76 --> 3800.3390000000004
but because in our minds we might have

3797.7 --> 3802.74
we're just gonna assume that we did make

3800.339 --> 3805.5589999999997
it and now we have that data even though

3802.74 --> 3808.0989999999997
we didn't do it yeah that's what that is

3805.559 --> 3811.52
that's what your near-death experience

3808.099 --> 3811.52
system is

3830.76 --> 3836.42
they ran up to their loved ones yeah

3833.88 --> 3836.42
of course

3837.599 --> 3843.42
but that's interpersonal that's inside

3840.24 --> 3845.7599999999998
of them however that represents itself

3843.42 --> 3848.819
in the near-death experience

3845.76 --> 3851.599
there's nothing you can conclude from

3848.819 --> 3855.66
that mechanically

3851.599 --> 3857.94
other than this is what a conscious

3855.66 --> 3859.5
individual in a near that experience

3857.94 --> 3862.7400000000002
goes through

3859.5 --> 3865.079
this is what kind of tends to happen

3862.74 --> 3868.9799999999996
that doesn't tell you anything about the

3865.079 --> 3870.42
actual afterlife experience or I'm not

3868.98 --> 3874.28
even talking about experience I'm

3870.42 --> 3874.28
talking about what will actually happen

3875.04 --> 3881.48
you can't base that all on a bunch of

3877.319 --> 3881.48
near-death experience descriptions

3881.88 --> 3884.96
because it's personal

3887.819 --> 3892.92
the one thing I do know you definitely

3890.099 --> 3895.619
don't have some weird random flip a coin

3892.92 --> 3897.1800000000003
situation and that if you guess it wrong

3895.619 --> 3899.819
or you didn't have the full information

3897.18 --> 3901.74
and you're just going by your bias

3899.819 --> 3905.24
that you could end up

3901.74 --> 3907.74

3905.24 --> 3911.5789999999997
absolute horseshit

3907.74 --> 3914.64
cannot logically work like that

3911.579 --> 3917.579

3914.64 --> 3918.54
completely negate like all purpose on

3918.54 --> 3924.0589999999997
everything that we do in our driven by

this is absolute nonsense

3924.059 --> 3931.3190000000004
logically cannot be like that

3927.24 --> 3935.04
right just why it cannot under any

3931.319 --> 3940.02
circumstance be logical to assume that

3935.04 --> 3943.079
if you do not chant the Jesus riddle

3940.02 --> 3944.88
right that you don't get to heaven

3943.079 --> 3947.04

3944.88 --> 3948.96
that makes no logical sense right or you

3947.04 --> 3951.48
don't get there and you go to hell yeah

3948.96 --> 3953.099
that doesn't make sense on exactly the

3951.48 --> 3957.119
same level

3953.099 --> 3960.299
it's a flip a coin situation and it's up

it's Preposterous it's ridiculous to

3960.299 --> 3962.839
assume that

3976.22 --> 3983.18
never go to the light it's a trap well

3997.619 --> 4003.1400000000003
feels like oh this thing here if I go

3999.9 --> 4007.059
toward it it'll mean the end

4003.14 --> 4007.0589999999997
it'll mean I will dissolute

that while alive guys I can feel that

those types of things

4018.319 --> 4023.24
they're really bad news for me even

4021.44 --> 4024.5
though there's nothing on the surface I

4023.24 --> 4026.8999999999996
can see

4024.5 --> 4029.66
to draw such a conclusion it's pure

4026.9 --> 4033.339
feeling it's Destiny it's a spirit thing

4029.66 --> 4033.339
I can feel it I know it

4034.22 --> 4038.66
that person is bad for me that person is

4037.4 --> 4040.94
good for me

4040.94 --> 4047.859
could do that with buildings okay I

4044.359 --> 4050.66
could do that with rocks and plants

you better believe I can do that with

out-of-body experience

4055.579 --> 4061.7200000000003

don't have a brain anymore when you're

4427.76 --> 4431.780000000001
shitty t-bass cam

4430.34 --> 4435.26
but yeah

4431.78 --> 4438.98
I mean visuals are decent

4435.26 --> 4441.92
but it's like this lag man the frame

4438.98 --> 4445.218999999999
rate is terrible on this thing

4441.92 --> 4448.9
that's not that's not tenable to me the

4445.219 --> 4452.37
frame rate must be higher it really must

4487.04 --> 4490.36
conspiracy theorist

4490.699 --> 4497.5599999999995
you have a channel

4492.5 --> 4497.56
so yoshins actually does streams

4501.199 --> 4503.62
cool

4504.62 --> 4513.04
did the Pope yet no not the Pope the old

4507.739 --> 4513.04
Pope died yes seeking style that's right

4522.8 --> 4526.78
with his name again uh

4527.239 --> 4533.08
yeah Benedict Pope Benedict the old one

4530.12 --> 4533.08
died

4534.64 --> 4539.2390000000005
[Music]

4536.56 --> 4543.5
I have a pretty good picture that can

4539.239 --> 4547.419999999999
probably represent accurately as to what

4543.5 --> 4547.42
his afterlife currently is like

4554.12 --> 4559.64
let me try to find it this is from a

4557.239 --> 4562.659
long time ago

4559.64 --> 4562.659000000001
and then

4574.52 --> 4577.540000000001
what is it

4578.659 --> 4585.679
oh wait yes the main one of course

4582.14 --> 4587.96
man I got so much old files this is like

4585.679 --> 4590.0
I got my own archive and it's really

4587.96 --> 4593.32
like this archive where I just have to

4590.0 --> 4593.32
like oh where did I store that

4593.36 --> 4599.239
but it's like all low

4596.9 --> 4601.4
it's very compacted information so it's

4599.239 --> 4604.4
not like taking up a lot of space but it

4601.4 --> 4607.36
is a lot uh

4604.4 --> 4607.36
where is it

4611.96 --> 4614.56
hmm

4617.78 --> 4621.4
yeah that's that's the one

4624.44 --> 4628.339999999999
I had such a naughty I had I made like a

4627.199 --> 4631.239
banner

4628.34 --> 4631.2390000000005
for somebody

4632.12 --> 4639.76
for what yeah somebody that like really

4634.88 --> 4639.76
hated it Catholicism and that was like

4644.78 --> 4648.5
in 2008

4650.54 --> 4654.1
so I made this

4657.82 --> 4661.42
this Banner

4663.02 --> 4669.02
oh by the way that that woman has a kid

4666.98 --> 4671.599999999999
this is pretty cute

4669.02 --> 4673.76
man I had all these nice women that I

4671.6 --> 4675.92
know that all have kids now like every

4673.76 --> 4678.14
single one of them has kids

4675.92 --> 4681.46
and with every one of them I'm like damn

4678.14 --> 4681.46
it why isn't that my kid

4684.98 --> 4690.639999999999
right so yeah

4687.26 --> 4690.64
this Pope died

4696.56 --> 4701.2390000000005
the old one

4698.659 --> 4702.86
who by the way I think as an individual

4701.239 --> 4705.5599999999995
he's probably

4702.86 --> 4707.54
like less [ __ ] up as the current one

4705.56 --> 4710.320000000001
because the current pope is really

4707.54 --> 4710.32
psycho

4715.34 --> 4719.3
but this one always looked so super

4717.679 --> 4722.2390000000005
creepy

4719.3 --> 4725.4800000000005
but the new guy the new guy the the

4722.239 --> 4727.218999999999
current pope he is like a real [ __ ] up

4725.48 --> 4731.0599999999995
person

4727.219 --> 4732.7390000000005
like much more like a broken spirit

4731.06 --> 4735.8
than this guy

4732.739 --> 4738.339999999999
was although I bet although Popes are

4735.8 --> 4738.34
pretty [ __ ] up

4739.52 --> 4743.360000000001
but anyway I thought that was a pretty

4741.56 --> 4745.79
accurate representation of where he

4743.36 --> 4747.38
probably is right now

4745.79 --> 4750.86
[Music]

4747.38 --> 4753.86
by his own actions

4750.86 --> 4756.5
seriously you won yeah

4753.86 --> 4761.259999999999
you looked so he always looked like he

4756.5 --> 4761.26
could be like the emperor from Star Wars

4763.4 --> 4770.239
but the new pope like doesn't look like

4766.58 --> 4774.4
that but he is actually that evil he is

4770.239 --> 4774.4
actually a really [ __ ] up person

4774.92 --> 4780.62
psychopath like a blatant one

4778.95 --> 4782.96
[Music]

4780.62 --> 4785.12
so yeah

4782.96 --> 4787.84
the old Pope died

4785.12 --> 4787.84
that's right

4793.04 --> 4796.04
hmm

4797.6 --> 4801.02
perhaps shooting at the gun range

4799.4 --> 4805.0599999999995
instead of fireworks

4801.02 --> 4805.06
okay I guess that could work why not

4811.96 --> 4818.36
yes Californians are portrayed as soft

4814.82 --> 4821.0
and weak and gay yeah skeptic but to be

4818.36 --> 4823.759999999999
fair most of you kind of are

4821.0 --> 4826.52
or have become that

4823.76 --> 4830.7390000000005
but I know that in between all that

4826.52 --> 4830.7390000000005
there are still some very serious

4831.58 --> 4835.96
old-fashioned Californians

4834.02 --> 4838.159000000001
in between

4835.96 --> 4840.8
but you're always going to be

4838.159 --> 4843.219
unfortunately outshone by just the

4840.8 --> 4846.96
freaking gay retards

4843.219 --> 4849.02
that have become quite a plague

4846.96 --> 4851.06
[Music]

4849.02 --> 4853.52
right and they're always going to stand

4851.06 --> 4855.320000000001
out more it'd be kind of similar

4853.52 --> 4858.080000000001
situation as they are in the Netherlands

4855.32 --> 4859.219
I mean we got some real [ __ ] up weenie

4858.08 --> 4862.699
people

4859.219 --> 4865.84
like crazy dumbass sjws and just

4862.699 --> 4868.759999999999
completely oblivious

4865.84 --> 4871.219
diluted political types that like

4868.76 --> 4873.62
literally don't know what the [ __ ] where

4871.219 --> 4875.7390000000005
they are

4873.62 --> 4879.14
but there's still some pretty badass

4875.739 --> 4881.599999999999
old-fashioned Dutch people like real old

4879.14 --> 4885.38
farmer types and like even young people

4881.6 --> 4888.320000000001
that are like the old types

4885.38 --> 4890.4800000000005
so there's all kinds of strong culture

4888.32 --> 4892.639999999999
in the Netherlands as well you just

4890.48 --> 4897.339999999999
don't get that rubbed in your face

4892.64 --> 4897.34

4909.92 --> 4915.02
dude things can go very wrong there as

4912.26 --> 4917.96
well I mean they literally just unleash

4915.02 --> 4920.780000000001
secret high-tech Weaponry on you

4917.96 --> 4923.84
like those Villages just completely

4920.78 --> 4925.699
burning down to the ground with multiple

4923.84 --> 4927.8
cars and all

4925.699 --> 4930.259999999999
through a bunch of helicopters flying

4927.8 --> 4933.1990000000005
over with these energy projection

4930.26 --> 4936.08

4933.199 --> 4937.639999999999

4936.08 --> 4940.04
mean

4937.64 --> 4941.719
they can really [ __ ] you up it's not

4940.04 --> 4944.6
like they're just gonna be a bunch of

4941.719 --> 4947.36
people with guns coming after you

4944.6 --> 4950.659000000001
yeah they do they will freaking send

4947.36 --> 4952.88
drone strikes at you if they felt like

4950.659 --> 4957.04
it

4952.88 --> 4957.04
just a bunch of guns is not gonna do it

4957.6 --> 4963.280000000001
[Music]

4960.199 --> 4966.62
now if you got Sam systems right

4963.28 --> 4968.659
surface-to-air missile defense now then

4966.62 --> 4970.219
you could get somewhere

4968.659 --> 4975.5199999999995
yes

4970.219 --> 4975.52
but that's probably not entirely legal

4983.84 --> 4988.3
for like a citizen that is

4989.0 --> 4992.719
even though according to the Second

4990.44 --> 4994.58
Amendment it should be I mean every

4992.719 --> 4997.34
American should have the right to have

4994.58 --> 4999.5199999999995
an up-to-date state-of-the-art fighted

4997.34 --> 4999.52
yet

5000.88 --> 5005.14
so why not a surface-to-air missile

5003.159 --> 5007.36
defense system you know

5005.14 --> 5009.58
as long as you're actually able to

5007.36 --> 5013.799999999999
maintain it and not accidentally shoot

5009.58 --> 5013.8
down passenger planes and [ __ ] right

5016.42 --> 5020.14
nobody invade your town not good on you

5018.94 --> 5022.239
I mean

5020.14 --> 5025.900000000001
if we're if you're gonna talk about just

5022.239 --> 5028.299999999999
criminals defending against those yeah I

5025.9 --> 5031.92
mean regular arms and all that

5028.3 --> 5031.92
that'll do the trick all right

5033.9 --> 5038.199
but if the government really wants to

5036.46 --> 5040.42
[ __ ] with you it's a lot more difficult

5038.199 --> 5042.839999999999

5040.42 --> 5042.84

[Music]

5047.76 --> 5053.1990000000005
Sam is better than it yet yeah it is but

5051.34 --> 5054.88
you can't do offensive action with it

5053.199 --> 5056.739
though

5054.88 --> 5060.9400000000005
you know

5056.739 --> 5064.0599999999995
I mean with a jet you can literally like

5060.94 --> 5066.659
strike at a completely different area

5064.06 --> 5066.659000000001
quickly

5067.9 --> 5073.9
but yeah I agree surf's the air missile

5070.96 --> 5077.5
defense systems are gonna be more and

5073.9 --> 5079.42
more valuable because there's just more

5077.5 --> 5081.219
air

5079.42 --> 5082.9
weaponry

5081.219 --> 5085.6

5085.6 --> 5089.4400000000005
there's all all these types of drone

5087.94 --> 5093.04
things and

5089.44 --> 5094.36
Sam's are going to be quite useful more

5093.04 --> 5096.82
and more and they're going to be more

5094.36 --> 5099.099999999999
updated more careful more precise until

5096.82 --> 5101.62
there's like micro Sams

5099.1 --> 5104.56
like regular sounds for bigger missiles

5101.62 --> 5105.76
but also small ones specifically to

5104.56 --> 5108.88
tackle

5105.76 --> 5110.679
like automated drones that are much

5108.88 --> 5113.02
smaller

5110.679 --> 5115.12
yeah it's all going to develop I'm I'm

5113.02 --> 5117.4800000000005
fairly certain about that

5115.12 --> 5121.19

5152.679 --> 5159.46
is a more real January 6 situation

5156.94 --> 5162.839999999999
because that thing was a giant flop and

5159.46 --> 5162.84
it was controlled and

5163.179 --> 5169.3
but I mean there's this myth and yeah at

5166.42 --> 5172.2390000000005
this point it's a United States myth

5169.3 --> 5174.52
because it's never happened

5172.239 --> 5177.699
in modern history

5174.52 --> 5180.639
like for at least 200 years never

5177.699 --> 5182.739
that is an actual armed uprise I mean

5180.639 --> 5183.9400000000005

so where is it

5190.659 --> 5195.42
I mean

5191.92 --> 5198.639
there's a pretty Savage hostile takeover

5195.42 --> 5199.719

5199.719 --> 5203.219
pretty Savage

5215.44 --> 5219.94
I mean if if that's gonna happen and

5218.139 --> 5221.62
it's really gonna there's no Army that

5219.94 --> 5224.799999999999

5503.58 --> 5508.719
you mean my uh last My Stream last night

5507.19 --> 5510.879999999999
[Music]

5508.719 --> 5514.86
I was pretty inspired for a New Year's

5510.88 --> 5514.86
Eve stream but I usually am though

5515.86 --> 5520.719
somebody in chat was even saying oh why

5518.62 --> 5522.76
can't you do just evening streams I had

5520.719 --> 5525.76
this elaborate email

5522.76 --> 5528.4800000000005
from a baller from Howard Moore but he

5525.76 --> 5528.4800000000005
really meant it

5530.139 --> 5535.139
and he was like oh why can't you just do

5532.12 --> 5535.139
evening streams

5535.84 --> 5540.9400000000005
and I was like yeah well

5538.96 --> 5542.26
you know it's because it's a special

5540.94 --> 5545.678999999999
occasion

5542.26 --> 5549.159000000001
and then I am like that because I could

5545.679 --> 5551.4400000000005
never do that like on a daily basis

5549.159 --> 5554.138999999999
it's only because I got all that extra

5551.44 --> 5557.678999999999
energy from all the anticipation because

5554.139 --> 5559.179
I do New Year's Eve streams every year

5557.679 --> 5561.4
it's something I do

5559.179 --> 5563.8
and I like doing it it's kind of fun

5561.4 --> 5566.739
also because I it's slightly different

5563.8 --> 5570.219
because I am now smoking and drinking on

5566.739 --> 5571.599999999999
camera which I absolutely do not allow

5570.219 --> 5575.219
normally

5571.6 --> 5575.219
and that's the only exception

5576.699 --> 5582.04
but yeah it was a lot of fun lust it

5578.8 --> 5584.56
lasted very long is probably the last

5582.04 --> 5587.88
the longest lasting New Year's Eve

5584.56 --> 5587.88
stream that I've done so far

5588.76 --> 5594.179
I'm glad I still got some good firework

5591.219 --> 5594.179
footage out of it

5603.219 --> 5606.219
foreign

5617.04 --> 5623.34
means 30 million that got your back dude

5620.38 --> 5625.3
we'll see man we'll see I mean really

5623.34 --> 5628.719
[Music]

5625.3 --> 5630.9400000000005
I mean I'm glad you think you got you're

5628.719 --> 5633.659
like ready and in defense mode or

5630.94 --> 5633.659
something but

5633.699 --> 5637.96
that doesn't really mean a lot to the

5636.1 --> 5640.6
outside world unless you're actually

5637.96 --> 5643.4800000000005
going to completely change the scene

5640.6 --> 5645.9400000000005
over there in the sense that

5643.48 --> 5648.959999999999
you're gonna make a move with it and not

5645.94 --> 5648.96
just be defensive

5651.4 --> 5656.259999999999
because as long as you don't it's it it

5654.159 --> 5658.659
doesn't mean anything to anybody else

5656.26 --> 5660.400000000001
it's just like yeah good on you you your

5658.659 --> 5662.86
defensive you're better than the media

5660.4 --> 5665.08
makes you look okay cool for you doesn't

5662.86 --> 5668.38
really change anything though right

5665.08 --> 5670.86
until you actually use that to change

5668.38 --> 5670.86
things

5671.02 --> 5675.820000000001
right so yeah I believe I very much

5673.96 --> 5679.36
believe if for some reason there would

5675.82 --> 5682.739
be like a Californian mobilization right

5679.36 --> 5682.739
a patriot mobilization

5683.08 --> 5688.719
and that isn't like organized by some

5685.659 --> 5690.879999999999
Alex Jones affiliate or something some

5688.719 --> 5692.44
Grappler that's gonna screw you over in

5690.88 --> 5695.08
the last minute

5692.44 --> 5698.678999999999
then I'd be like whoa

5695.08 --> 5701.5599999999995
It's the Great Californian mobilization

5698.679 --> 5704.02
things are going to change now right I

5701.56 --> 5705.820000000001
mean that that would definitely catch my

5704.02 --> 5707.320000000001
attention

5705.82 --> 5710.259999999999
thank you

5707.32 --> 5712.48
but yeah I mean you guys being very

5710.26 --> 5715.12
armed and defensive and pretty much

5712.48 --> 5716.98
sitting where you are it doesn't really

5715.12 --> 5720.26
do anything

5716.98 --> 5726.179999999999
for the rest of the world at least

5720.26 --> 5726.18
[Music]

5729.34 --> 5732.54
but yeah good to hear

5733.659 --> 5736.98
I will keep it in mind

5738.159 --> 5741.159
foreign

5743.4 --> 5748.679
traveler Happy New Year

5745.719 --> 5748.679
good to see you

5749.38 --> 5755.46
oh well I'm getting getting really

5753.04 --> 5755.46
hungry

5762.699 --> 5768.759999999999
ah there's still some oh of course right

5765.46 --> 5770.7390000000005
in front of my house here he is but it's

5768.76 --> 5772.56
funny because there's just barely any

5770.739 --> 5776.739
fireworks now I mean do you remember

5772.56 --> 5778.3
yesterday's daytime stream

5776.739 --> 5780.5199999999995
foreign

5778.3 --> 5782.159000000001
how much firework there was just

5780.52 --> 5785.8
continually happening

5782.159 --> 5788.199
and that was like in the afternoon

5785.8 --> 5793.26
and now it's the same time and there's

5788.199 --> 5793.259999999999
just barely any bang ever

5795.46 --> 5800.32
it's it's a relief though

5798.76 --> 5802.8
it's good to have a bit of peace and

5800.32 --> 5802.799999999999
quiet again

5802.87 --> 5806.71
[Music]

5807.76 --> 5810.179
foreign

5810.42 --> 5814.56
crazy with your fireworks

5815.26 --> 5819.900000000001
it's been much more extreme though in

5817.6 --> 5822.280000000001
the past when it wasn't made illegal

5819.9 --> 5826.0
because yeah

5822.28 --> 5827.86
all of that yesterday that was all

5826.0 --> 5829.9
illegal

5827.86 --> 5833.5599999999995
like we're not supposed to do that

5829.9 --> 5836.62
anymore yeah go screw yourself

5833.56 --> 5837.46
Dutch do fireworks with New Year's Eve

5836.62 --> 5840.94
yeah

5837.46 --> 5844.06
I mean it's almost like telling an

5840.94 --> 5847.78
American you can't light any fireworks

5844.06 --> 5850.120000000001
this Fourth of July right

5847.78 --> 5853.179
like Americans are gonna be stopped by

5850.12 --> 5856.42
that right well the same goes for New

5853.179 --> 5859.6
Year's Eve and fireworks right because

5856.42 --> 5861.1
we don't typically do organized firework

5859.6 --> 5863.9400000000005
shows

5861.1 --> 5867.639
we buy it and we light it

5863.94 --> 5870.099999999999
we like doing that

5867.639 --> 5871.719
and then that way you can get to see

5870.1 --> 5874.3
these types of displays where it's

5871.719 --> 5877.06
literally everywhere like literally you

5874.3 --> 5879.639
could go 360 around and there's

5877.06 --> 5882.159000000001
literally fireworks everywhere

5879.639 --> 5885.46
that's the Netherlands because everybody

5882.159 --> 5888.0
has fireworks or a lot of people in

5885.46 --> 5888.0
every location

5888.34 --> 5893.32
that's the difference

5891.04 --> 5895.3
so it's not just one location where

5893.32 --> 5897.219
there's like this extravagant fireworks

5895.3 --> 5898.96
and the rest nothing

5897.219 --> 5901.06
and I like it much more this way because

5898.96 --> 5902.9800000000005
now you can just like I didn't even

5901.06 --> 5907.179
light any fireworks myself but I could

5902.98 --> 5909.54
literally just smell the gunpowder ah

5907.179 --> 5912.6
love it

5909.54 --> 5912.6
thank you

5914.56 --> 5917.34
foreign

5926.88 --> 5930.109
[Music]

5933.54 --> 5937.9
but fireworks is our thing and nothing

5936.04 --> 5940.84
is going to stop it it's like we don't

5937.9 --> 5942.099999999999
care if it's legal we do what we do

5940.84 --> 5944.92
yeah

5942.1 --> 5947.679
and that by the way stands for a whole

5944.92 --> 5949.6
bunch of things yeah we don't care what

5947.679 --> 5953.8
you're gonna tell us we're allowed to do

5949.6 --> 5957.219
or not we do what we do

5953.8 --> 5961.38
and your cultural deranged influences

5957.219 --> 5961.38
are not gonna change us anymore

5962.679 --> 5966.639
I can only of course speak for myself

5964.42 --> 5969.6
but I definitely hope that a lot of

5966.639 --> 5972.400000000001
Dutch people feel exactly like that like

5969.6 --> 5975.219
we know what we are we know where this

5972.4 --> 5976.9
came from we know from our past what it

5975.219 --> 5978.58
actually should be

5976.9 --> 5980.259999999999
and what it stands for and we're going

5978.58 --> 5984.48
to keep doing that we don't give a [ __ ]

5980.26 --> 5987.34
with this invasive communist Marxist

5984.48 --> 5989.678999999999
anti-nationalist government is telling

5987.34 --> 5990.76
us that we should become go [ __ ]

5989.679 --> 5994.42
yourself

5990.76 --> 5997.08
you should all be executed

5994.42 --> 6000.9
under nurenberg trial setting

5997.08 --> 6003.659
and I mean the whole swath that's like a

6000.9 --> 6006.0599999999995
thousand people in the Netherlands

6003.659 --> 6009.62
they should all be executed at this

6006.06 --> 6009.620000000001
point for doing what they do

6014.06 --> 6019.320000000001
and arguably the ones that are too

6017.219 --> 6021.6
dramatic in their crime they should be

6019.32 --> 6023.639
banished

6021.6 --> 6026.639
like get the [ __ ] out of the country

6023.639 --> 6029.719
you're never allowed in back again under

6026.639 --> 6029.719
any circumstance

6032.46 --> 6037.56
but there should definitely be a series

6034.98 --> 6040.62
of executions

6037.56 --> 6044.34
where they die

6040.62 --> 6046.62
because this cannot it's it's just

6044.34 --> 6048.84
because of that just because of that

6046.62 --> 6050.82
because of their continual

6048.84 --> 6052.38
pushing and just getting away with

6050.82 --> 6055.679
everything through corruption and

6052.38 --> 6059.400000000001
getting in getting their people in the

6055.679 --> 6064.1990000000005
gist in the judicial system I mean

6059.4 --> 6066.78
cannot be allowed to continue like this

6064.199 --> 6069.12
and for that some of those people have

6066.78 --> 6072.3
to be executed

6069.12 --> 6074.46
I don't give a [ __ ] if that's not

6072.3 --> 6077.820000000001
supposed to be the Dutch law anymore go

6074.46 --> 6081.26
[ __ ] yourself yeah bring death penalty

6077.82 --> 6081.259999999999
back bring it back

6083.12 --> 6087.9
Marxist treacherous infiltrating

6086.34 --> 6092.84
politicians

6087.9 --> 6092.839999999999
should be executed

6096.42 --> 6101.76
just like

6098.88 --> 6103.8
like child rapist murderers

6101.76 --> 6106.92
they should also be executed I don't

6103.8 --> 6108.78
give a [ __ ] it's in you mean go [ __ ]

6106.92 --> 6111.42
yourself why'd you go kill yourself then

6108.78 --> 6115.08
you scumbag those people should be

6111.42 --> 6117.719
executed I don't give a [ __ ] what do you

6115.08 --> 6120.92
think it's not the right way

6117.719 --> 6120.92
execute them

6121.199 --> 6126.659
I think people that want to defend

6124.04 --> 6129.48
disgusting psychopath murderers and

6126.659 --> 6132.42
Marxist infiltrating trade treachers

6129.48 --> 6134.5199999999995
politicians that insist on that they

6132.42 --> 6137.159
don't get executed I think that those

6134.52 --> 6139.1990000000005
people should get executed

6137.159 --> 6142.879999999999
yeah

6139.199 --> 6146.638999999999
how [ __ ] dare you

6142.88 --> 6149.639
Force the continuation of such people to

6146.639 --> 6152.4800000000005
in their existence how [ __ ] dare you

6149.639 --> 6156.36
defend that

6152.48 --> 6157.98
execution of political treacherous

6156.36 --> 6161.159
marxists

6157.98 --> 6164.239
and child rapist murderers

6161.159 --> 6167.638999999999
execution yeah

6164.239 --> 6170.58
the rest I don't know

6167.639 --> 6172.1990000000005
I mean yeah if you shoot a bunch of cops

6170.58 --> 6176.34
that's [ __ ] up

6172.199 --> 6179.759999999999
life in jail right I mean and but

6176.34 --> 6181.8
depending on the circumstances but

6179.76 --> 6184.52
I mean

6181.8 --> 6186.139
at least you're not a Marxist

6184.52 --> 6189.0
treacherous

6186.139 --> 6192.0
anti-nationalist politician that's tried

6189.0 --> 6193.619
to kill and poison

6192.0 --> 6195.9
the nation

6193.619 --> 6197.699
and at least you're not a child rapist

6195.9 --> 6202.08
murderer

6197.699 --> 6204.8099999999995
because those two should be executed

6202.08 --> 6208.0199999999995
special exception

6204.81 --> 6208.02
[Music]

6228.78 --> 6234.179
bro what

6230.76 --> 6236.159000000001
now I'm just ranting here

6234.179 --> 6239.63
but I just want to make it clear that

6236.159 --> 6242.219
those people doing that should die

6239.63 --> 6244.76
[Music]

6242.219 --> 6244.76
right

6248.88 --> 6255.659000000001
I'll I'll probably be pushing things to

6253.38 --> 6258.42
wherever they need to go in order for

6255.659 --> 6260.94
that to become reality

6258.42 --> 6263.46
those people cannot be allowed to

6260.94 --> 6266.5199999999995
survive this

6263.46 --> 6269.58
they have to die

6266.52 --> 6272.34
have to die for their crime

6269.58 --> 6273.179
don't give a [ __ ] if a judge agrees to

6272.34 --> 6275.400000000001
that

6273.179 --> 6278.219
or if even if the people with their

6275.4 --> 6282.119
weenie indoctrination care about that or

6278.219 --> 6284.88
agree it has to happen they have to die

6282.119 --> 6287.699
they cannot be allowed to get away with

6284.88 --> 6289.8
this and move on and hide somewhere in

6287.699 --> 6292.199
another country

6289.8 --> 6293.6990000000005
that happens then they should be tracked

6292.199 --> 6298.159
down

6293.699 --> 6298.159
caught and executed

6299.62 --> 6302.83
[Music]

6305.21 --> 6310.5
[Music]

6306.86 --> 6314.639
as far as I'm concerned every wef

6310.5 --> 6316.87
participant is all on a death list every

6314.639 --> 6324.479
single one

6316.87 --> 6324.479
[Music]

6325.98 --> 6328.218999999999
foreign

6340.94 --> 6346.4
but that's like a home situation this is

6344.1 --> 6346.400000000001
not

6346.44 --> 6349.98
about personal

6350.3 --> 6354.06
self-defense or whatever what I was just

6353.04 --> 6357.06
saying

6354.06 --> 6360.06
this is about a national priority this

6357.06 --> 6362.46
is about National Security yeah I'm

6360.06 --> 6365.2390000000005
using that word this is about National

6362.46 --> 6365.2390000000005
Security

6367.679 --> 6371.58
something I think

6370.08 --> 6374.28
has been

6371.58 --> 6378.0599999999995
brutally watered down

6374.28 --> 6380.58
in my nation and other places as part of

6378.06 --> 6382.9800000000005
the Marxist project

6380.58 --> 6386.46
to destroy our nation

6382.98 --> 6388.5599999999995
first thing to go is how serious Secret

6386.46 --> 6392.639
Service

6388.56 --> 6396.26
are taking the stability of the nation

6392.639 --> 6396.26
we usually turn against it

6396.48 --> 6400.5199999999995
which is what makes things so bad

6401.1 --> 6405.659000000001
because normally they're out there to

6403.44 --> 6408.659
stop to stop these things from happening

6405.659 --> 6411.299999999999
the Secret Service is there

6408.659 --> 6413.46
so you don't have to face that

6411.3 --> 6414.54
corruption

6413.46 --> 6417.6
they

6414.54 --> 6418.86
make the call they go and make visits to

6417.6 --> 6420.719
people

6418.86 --> 6423.179
when they're actually doing their job

6420.719 --> 6425.04
and prevent this sort of disgusting

6423.179 --> 6427.86
corruption

6425.04 --> 6430.38
but they haven't been doing that

6427.86 --> 6435.44
we have other priorities they basically

6430.38 --> 6435.4400000000005
become wef agenda puppets

6440.94 --> 6444.08
and complicit

6448.739 --> 6452.839999999999
maybe one big pun Happy New Year

6463.82 --> 6469.08
don't worry

6465.96 --> 6471.9800000000005
stop a person that interacts and look

6469.08 --> 6471.98
interesting

6477.36 --> 6480.53
[Music]

6491.37 --> 6494.5599999999995
[Music]

6495.719 --> 6501.92
and destruction yeah well that's too

6499.38 --> 6504.719
late for us

6501.92 --> 6509.52
and it doesn't really matter

6504.719 --> 6512.82
because the so the true arms

6509.52 --> 6514.5
are literally arms

6512.82 --> 6517.619
yeah

6514.5 --> 6519.179
because you can't take some weapon

6517.619 --> 6522.0599999999995
system away

6519.179 --> 6524.159
well you could build a new one

6522.06 --> 6526.679
or you could take another one right it's

6524.159 --> 6530.04
like oh you take away my gun okay I'll

6526.679 --> 6532.02
get it I'll get a knife big one oh

6530.04 --> 6533.88

6532.02 --> 6538.580000000001
baseball oh you're taking that away okay

6533.88 --> 6538.58
I'll [ __ ] use my hands

6538.619 --> 6544.5599999999995
or a broomstick

6541.38 --> 6547.6990000000005
or just a piece of wood for building

6544.56 --> 6553.1
like there's nothing you can do to stop

6547.699 --> 6553.099999999999
a person from making a weapon nothing

6553.619 --> 6559.199
yeah take a broomstick

6556.08 --> 6561.54
yeah you cut a point on it you gotta

6559.199 --> 6564.659
spare that's a weapon it can be really

6561.54 --> 6567.56
deadly there's nothing in the world you

6564.659 --> 6567.5599999999995
can do about it

6568.739 --> 6574.259999999999
only thing you can do is just threaten

6571.739 --> 6576.32
say oh this weapon is not allowed

6574.26 --> 6578.820000000001
it's too dangerous

6576.32 --> 6581.639
criminals will use them all that

6578.82 --> 6583.199
[ __ ] revert World craps all that

6581.639 --> 6586.1990000000005

6586.199 --> 6592.04
man if you know how to throw a rock you

6588.36 --> 6592.04

6594.59 --> 6597.959
[Music]

dude I have a whole

6603.84 --> 6611.219

[Music]

6651.6 --> 6657.360000000001
you can do the Joker

6654.78 --> 6659.46
anything can be a weapon nothing they

6657.36 --> 6661.82
can do to stop it

6659.46 --> 6665.219
right where there's a will there's a way

6661.82 --> 6668.759999999999
really applies to that

6665.219 --> 6671.1
right if it's the will then people will

6668.76 --> 6673.26
literally use their hands to finish

6671.1 --> 6675.05
somebody off they don't care right if

6673.26 --> 6678.159000000001
