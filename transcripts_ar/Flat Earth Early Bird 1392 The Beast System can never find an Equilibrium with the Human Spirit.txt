foreign

7.55 --> 37.439
[Music]

65.96 --> 70.88
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

69.479 --> 74.34
bird number

70.88 --> 75.96
1392 I'm your host Arwin and before I

74.34 --> 78.479
start the show please don't forget to

75.96 --> 81.119
share it now on any platform medium fit

78.479 --> 83.7
and if you haven't already subscribe to

81.119 --> 85.439
my channel hit the Bell notification so

83.7 --> 87.72
you know when I'm going live

85.439 --> 89.939
which is normally 1pm Amsterdam time in

87.72 --> 92.28
weekdays and 2 pm Amsterdam time in the

89.939 --> 94.25899999999999
weekend and please also do support me

92.28 --> 96.54
through the PayPal patreon and

94.259 --> 98.7
membership system join button they'll be

96.54 --> 100.68
much appreciated and yeah I can really

98.7 --> 105.5
use it

100.68 --> 105.5
really rooting for some paypals today

105.9 --> 113.46000000000001
or yeah this weekend is going to be kind

110.04 --> 113.46000000000001
of tight right

115.2 --> 120.60000000000001
the weather today is uh

118.2 --> 124.02000000000001
super dreary

120.6 --> 127.64
last night it was all Misty like serious

124.02 --> 127.64
mist I haven't seen that in a while

128.399 --> 132.42
and now it's not really missed it's just

130.679 --> 136.68
this

132.42 --> 139.14
micro this curtain of micro droplets not

136.68 --> 141.59900000000002
just floating around

139.14 --> 144.2
very dreary very wet

141.599 --> 148.28
haven't gone outside yet

144.2 --> 148.28
not looking forward to that

162.379 --> 168.89999999999998
hello psych bear first in chat PGC net

166.98 --> 175.62
good to see you

168.9 --> 175.62
it is Friday the 14th of October 2022.

188.28 --> 190.76
all right

191.519 --> 197.58
so yeah

193.68 --> 201.959
and if a really good meal last last

197.58 --> 203.81900000000002
night one last night yesterday evening

201.959 --> 206.459
made some

203.819 --> 208.61999999999998
like spaghetti from scratch again I

206.459 --> 210.3
haven't done that in a long time really

208.62 --> 213.0
because it

210.3 --> 216.36
I would just typically Buy

213.0 --> 216.36
one uh

216.42 --> 220.61999999999998
like a can

218.099 --> 223.07999999999998
of sauce that was like good enough

220.62 --> 225.0
because it's so much easier right so

223.08 --> 227.58
this time yeah it did take me like two

225.0 --> 231.599
hours which it usually does

227.58 --> 234.9
but yeah I really needed that and that

231.599 --> 237.0
certainly hit the spot I mean right now

234.9 --> 240.54
like this all morning I am not even

237.0 --> 243.98
hungry I'm still digesting like my

240.54 --> 243.98
spaghetti and all that from yesterday

245.819 --> 251.29899999999998
right

247.68 --> 251.299
low clutch let's see you

254.0 --> 258.979
ah

255.78 --> 258.979
good title yeah

260.699 --> 266.36
it's like I come I came up with that

262.44 --> 266.36
somewhere during jimbob stream

266.88 --> 274.15999999999997
right

269.03 --> 274.15999999999997
[Music]

275.04 --> 278.06
right so yesterday

278.1 --> 281.759
another very long flutter debates after

280.62 --> 284.479
show

281.759 --> 284.47900000000004
was great

289.8 --> 293.72
what else what's going on

294.24 --> 300.96000000000004
oh yeah apparently flat Zoid

297.0 --> 302.759
went up against Craig again

300.96 --> 305.4
on the show

302.759 --> 306.41900000000004
I yeah

305.4 --> 310.32
to

306.419 --> 313.02
sort of have a a decent debate and I

310.32 --> 316.259
mean for going up against fight to Flat

313.02 --> 318.59999999999997
Earth I mean that was pretty decent

316.259 --> 320.699
most of the times when the flat earth

318.6 --> 322.5
goes up against him he just gets so

320.699 --> 324.66
rumpacy it gets completely out of

322.5 --> 326.84
control well he was a little rhombusy

324.66 --> 326.84000000000003
but

327.539 --> 331.34
yeah it was still annoying

331.62 --> 334.82
I didn't watch it all

334.86 --> 341.34000000000003
but yeah flat so it's going up against

337.62 --> 344.52
Ballers now with this show

341.34 --> 346.38
or anti-flat earthers

344.52 --> 349.82
and curious to see what else is going to

346.38 --> 349.82
be able to pull out of Craig

363.06 --> 365.24
thank you

368.53 --> 371.72999999999996
[Music]

373.58 --> 379.58
who said that I don't know laser lie

377.539 --> 382.259
by the way

379.58 --> 387.35999999999996
which as in who

382.259 --> 389.58000000000004
is spelled with an a with an H before

387.36 --> 394.86
the eye

389.58 --> 397.31899999999996
and no T so that's weird anyway

394.86 --> 399.06
yeah I mean that that's just coriolus

397.319 --> 401.16
talk I mean that what you're talking

399.06 --> 402.96
about typically falls into Neil deGrasse

401.16 --> 406.759
Tyson reasoning

402.96 --> 406.75899999999996
like he did with the the football

406.979 --> 412.039
hitting the goal because it deviated

409.5 --> 414.36
slightly because of Earth's spin right

412.039 --> 417.259
what you're talking about falls into

414.36 --> 417.259
that category

417.84 --> 423.78
right none of it actually happens though

420.6 --> 426.0
it's just a description mind experiment

423.78 --> 429.5
so

426.0 --> 429.5
well Kuma virus

430.48 --> 433.649
[Music]

454.699 --> 461.52000000000004
yeah nobody cares akumu

458.52 --> 461.52
foreign

468.479 --> 471.199
right

473.039 --> 475.94
uh

476.6 --> 481.88
[Music]

478.8 --> 485.079
let's see what else

481.88 --> 485.079
[Music]

490.08 --> 493.699
yeah I think that was about it

501.84 --> 508.34
oh yesterday well yeah beside watching

504.3 --> 508.34000000000003
videos I've also just been listening to

510.72 --> 514.4590000000001
got two good stuff Horse music

515.82 --> 519.32
it is really something else

519.719 --> 525.3000000000001
it's just a few songs that I like

522.26 --> 528.12
readily recognize I mean you must have a

525.3 --> 531.8599999999999
lot more I don't even I'm probably not

528.12 --> 531.86
even heard most of his work

532.32 --> 536.6400000000001
but yeah it's great glad to have brought

535.44 --> 538.6800000000001
that up

536.64 --> 540.36
yesterday

538.68 --> 542.5799999999999
anyway

540.36 --> 545.16
I guess it's gonna be flat Earth

542.58 --> 547.2
mechanics talk which I absolutely don't

545.16 --> 548.88
mind I mean that's what I love about

547.2 --> 550.98
being on the Flat Earth debates when

548.88 --> 554.06
it's like that so

550.98 --> 554.0600000000001
you do that here too

565.45 --> 579.6800000000001
[Music]

576.12 --> 579.68
you're happy just I mean

580.86 --> 588.1800000000001
the whole air rotating in lockstep with

584.339 --> 590.7
the Earth is such a cluster screw

588.18 --> 592.8599999999999
with complications upon complications

590.7 --> 595.9200000000001
that yeah it makes absolutely no sense

592.86 --> 598.38
unless you're just gonna go for the pure

595.92 --> 600.36
Einstein Wizardry and do what Baldwin

598.38 --> 602.399
does sometimes when I feel like it on

600.36 --> 605.339
the Flat Earth debates and it's just say

602.399 --> 608.459
like no no it's all relative

605.339 --> 612.3000000000001
I had a whole skit by the way being

608.459 --> 614.0999999999999
Baldwin yesterday very long pretty much

612.3 --> 616.64
the entire live show if I remember

614.1 --> 616.64
correctly

616.98 --> 620.94
but I would say like yeah no no no but

619.62 --> 623.1
look

620.94 --> 625.2
either the Earth is spinning underneath

623.1 --> 627.3000000000001
the universe or the universe is spinning

625.2 --> 631.019
around the Earth

627.3 --> 632.519
well it might be that the universe is

631.019 --> 633.839
literally spinning around the Earth and

632.519 --> 637.14
the Earth is the only thing in the

633.839 --> 640.3800000000001
universe that's actually stationary

637.14 --> 642.36
but that is too weird so you gotta think

640.38 --> 644.579
of the Earth spinning underneath the

642.36 --> 647.3000000000001
universe

644.579 --> 647.3
huh

647.579 --> 651.779
but that's it's pure magical thinking

650.04 --> 653.399
though I mean that's not actually

651.779 --> 657.98
mechanic stock

653.399 --> 657.98
it is all the relative talk

660.42 --> 665.8199999999999
right

662.42 --> 669.7199999999999
so that's how Ballwin solves that so

665.82 --> 672.6
that you don't have to basically

669.72 --> 674.88
keep building a broken narrative

672.6 --> 676.62
because actually trying to find an

674.88 --> 679.5
excuse why

676.62 --> 681.779
gas would rotate

679.5 --> 684.54
with the Earth

681.779 --> 685.98
you can't make that work it's just not

684.54 --> 687.8
possible

685.98 --> 690.3000000000001
there's too many

687.8 --> 692.459
physics-based conflictions with that and

690.3 --> 695.519
like empirical testing that would prove

692.459 --> 696.959
that it's not true tests that even I

695.519 --> 700.019
myself

696.959 --> 702.06
have seen

700.019 --> 704.4590000000001
in school I think if I remember

702.06 --> 708.1199999999999
correctly or maybe not maybe I just

704.459 --> 711.3599999999999
already dug into the investigation of

708.12 --> 714.779
would air move in lockstep

711.36 --> 717.6
with a spinning with spinning stuff

714.779 --> 719.1
but I don't think I've ever seen the

717.6 --> 721.38
experiment but I think that my teacher

719.1 --> 723.12
back then did actually explain this to

721.38 --> 724.68
me like now the gas doesn't actually

723.12 --> 726.54
rotate with it

724.68 --> 729.54
it's just gonna stand still in between

726.54 --> 731.459
it unless something is scooping it up

729.54 --> 734.16
and pressing against it

731.459 --> 736.8599999999999
and then it might move with that

734.16 --> 738.779
and that always really stuck to me even

736.86 --> 741.66
though I didn't even realize yet that

738.779 --> 743.3389999999999
the ball mechanics were not

741.66 --> 745.62
correct

743.339 --> 748.9200000000001
I already learned that lesson and there

745.62 --> 751.2
was no ball energy to prevent me from

748.92 --> 755.899
basically assimilating that at the time

751.2 --> 755.899
I would think I was like 11 or something

756.779 --> 764.8389999999999
or maybe 13 somewhere there I don't know

761.04 --> 764.8389999999999
it's a long time ago

765.0 --> 768.72
right

766.92 --> 771.4799999999999
smart dude

768.72 --> 774.6600000000001
well he's me

771.48 --> 777.779
It's Just Another Part of Me

774.66 --> 779.639
uh Jesus yes good to see you miss crazy

777.779 --> 782.639
hat

779.639 --> 782.639
frl

783.3 --> 789.18
available no it it's not just it's just

787.139 --> 791.399
something you would have to do I can

789.18 --> 792.42
explain to you the setup and I have in

791.399 --> 794.519
the past

792.42 --> 797.519
done it multiple times on this show like

794.519 --> 800.82
how do you prove to yourself that gas

797.519 --> 803.36
doesn't actually move with the rotating

800.82 --> 803.36
system

803.399 --> 809.1
well you take a centrifuge you put stuff

805.86 --> 812.339
in the centrifuge bunch of dirt

809.1 --> 814.9200000000001
I don't know whatever you want rocks

812.339 --> 818.399
sand would be a recommender

814.92 --> 820.92
water very easy to get anyway

818.399 --> 822.3
and the rest gas and then have like a

820.92 --> 823.77
system

822.3 --> 825.4799999999999
maybe a tube

823.77 --> 829.98
[Music]

825.48 --> 833.639
that then spins at all kinds of yeah

829.98 --> 838.2
rotatory speeds

833.639 --> 841.32
and then you can literally test it

838.2 --> 844.86
you can have Within

841.32 --> 846.779
the rotating tube it would be like a

844.86 --> 849.1800000000001
tire right like an inflated Tire

846.779 --> 851.279
something like that but hopefully

849.18 --> 852.899
transparent so you can see something

851.279 --> 855.36
that's going on in there otherwise it's

852.899 --> 859.56
kind of pointless and then maybe have

855.36 --> 861.12
sensors in there on the inside

859.56 --> 863.04
of

861.12 --> 865.5600000000001
the Taurus let's just call it a tour

863.04 --> 869.639
let's just Define it by a geometric

865.56 --> 872.3389999999999
shape on the inside sensors that would

869.639 --> 875.16
basically pick up the air

872.339 --> 878.519
like air friction or something right

875.16 --> 882.36
some kind of uh wind motion sensors

878.519 --> 886.019
that would then spin with the thing

882.36 --> 888.42
at incredible speed so maybe and then

886.019 --> 891.12
eventually when all that stuff in there

888.42 --> 893.519
is found in equilibrium like all the the

891.12 --> 895.5
dirt is stuck to the outside the water

893.519 --> 899.82
stuck to that it's kind of circular

895.5 --> 901.86
maybe it's actually hectagonal Ah that's

899.82 --> 903.0
something that I saw

901.86 --> 906.12
right

903.0 --> 909.26
spinning water at incredible rates I've

906.12 --> 912.3
seen that and it actually forms

909.26 --> 914.88
hexagonal patterns which is

912.3 --> 916.8599999999999
totally surreal I don't understand even

914.88 --> 919.139
how that's possible

916.86 --> 921.839
but that's another that's another thing

919.139 --> 923.82
they showed me that it really surreal to

921.839 --> 925.44
me it immediately reminded me of oh why

923.82 --> 927.0600000000001
no could this have to do with the

925.44 --> 929.0400000000001
hexagon on

927.06 --> 932.16
on Jupiter

929.04 --> 934.5
or Saturn or whatever it is it's one of

932.16 --> 936.54
these supposed planets the CGI of it

934.5 --> 938.459
they put that at the top it was always a

936.54 --> 940.579
big mystery to me before I realized that

938.459 --> 943.56
of course or none of that is actually

940.579 --> 947.0999999999999
based on real footage

943.56 --> 950.04
but the thing is sorry for the side

947.1 --> 953.279
tracking to back to the Taurus test

950.04 --> 956.0999999999999
spinning it around you have these well

953.279 --> 959.82
wind sensors that's are spinning with

956.1 --> 963.0600000000001
the the Taurus and they should pick up

959.82 --> 966.0600000000001
whether the air is moving in relation to

963.06 --> 967.26
the spinning Taurus the air inside it

966.06 --> 970.3199999999999
or

967.26 --> 972.779
that it isn't as much and that it

970.32 --> 976.44
basically keeps blowing no matter how

972.779 --> 977.9399999999999
many times you spin it or how fast

976.44 --> 980.1600000000001
and

977.94 --> 981.839
I am willing to go as far as to

980.16 --> 985.74
guarantee you

981.839 --> 988.1
let that air will at no point under no

985.74 --> 991.76
circumstances or conditions ever

988.1 --> 996.0
actually move in frictionless lock step

991.76 --> 998.8199999999999
with the content of the spinning Taurus

996.0 --> 1002.0
I guarantee this to you and I'd love

998.82 --> 1004.94
people to actually do it

1002.0 --> 1006.32
if you have the the stuff the money the

1004.94 --> 1010.2790000000001
time

1006.32 --> 1012.4590000000001
it's not a complicated setup

1010.279 --> 1012.459
foreign

1014.72 --> 1020.72
but that's a test you could literally do

1018.5 --> 1022.519
yourself it isn't too incredibly

1020.72 --> 1024.02
difficult you don't need like an argon

1022.519 --> 1026.179
laser or something something that's

1024.02 --> 1028.22
worth millions you can build that

1026.179 --> 1030.799
I don't know maybe for like around 100

1028.22 --> 1033.14
bucks or something I don't know you

1030.799 --> 1036.199
could probably build that and then test

1033.14 --> 1038.8390000000002
it and then see for yourself that gas

1036.199 --> 1041.0
actually never at any point starts to

1038.839 --> 1043.52
move in perfect frictionless lock step

1041.0 --> 1045.439
with the rest of the content of the

1043.52 --> 1047.78
spinning reference rate it just doesn't

1045.439 --> 1050.8400000000001
happen

1047.78 --> 1052.52
test it yourself or don't and keep it a

1050.84 --> 1054.26
mystery forever and just convince

1052.52 --> 1056.24
yourself that air moves in lockstep with

1054.26 --> 1058.82
a rotating reference frame

1056.24 --> 1061.94
you can do that too denial is much

1058.82 --> 1065.36
easier much cheaper on the short run

1061.94 --> 1068.1200000000001
you can do that too if you want

1065.36 --> 1071.299
I'm quite convinced

1068.12 --> 1073.76
that doing that test will reveal to you

1071.299 --> 1076.12
that the error at no point starts to

1073.76 --> 1078.98
move in lockstep

1076.12 --> 1081.02
frictionlessly with the rest of the

1078.98 --> 1083.919
content of the spinning reference frame

1081.02 --> 1083.9189999999999
it's that simple

1084.5 --> 1091.82
unless you in the Taurus start to build

1088.28 --> 1094.46
an entire if you cut off a segment if

1091.82 --> 1096.559
you like have a little circle stuck in

1094.46 --> 1101.78
there well that Circle spinning around

1096.559 --> 1104.0
would then start pushing against the air

1101.78 --> 1108.3799999999999
and that's the only condition that would

1104.0 --> 1111.559
actually cause the air to move

1108.38 --> 1115.16
in lockstep with the entire thing

1111.559 --> 1118.039
because it's being physically pushed

1115.16 --> 1122.419
around literally around

1118.039 --> 1125.0
by the obstruction and then eventually a

1122.419 --> 1126.38
gradient will form within the gas

1125.0 --> 1128.179
right

1126.38 --> 1130.46
let's just say you have this Taurus

1128.179 --> 1132.02
thing a platform it's spinning it's

1130.46 --> 1134.539
pushing

1132.02 --> 1136.6399999999999
well on the where it's pushing that's

1134.539 --> 1139.46
where the gradient of the gas is going

1136.64 --> 1141.98
to be the thickest and right behind it

1139.46 --> 1145.28
is going to be the least thick that's

1141.98 --> 1147.5
how the gas will then gradiate within

1145.28 --> 1150.44
the spinning reference frame

1147.5 --> 1152.9
but without any platform consistently

1150.44 --> 1155.24
pushing it forward within the rotatory

1152.9 --> 1157.22
reference frame the gas will not be

1155.24 --> 1159.559
pushed around and it will

1157.22 --> 1162.26
try to find

1159.559 --> 1164.059
or try to find it will simply

1162.26 --> 1167.179
go to

1164.059 --> 1169.46
a more stationary

1167.179 --> 1172.5800000000002
position within the rotatory reference

1169.46 --> 1175.88
frame and maybe a little drag will push

1172.58 --> 1179.059
some of it along like on the edges right

1175.88 --> 1181.3400000000001
next to the liquid and solid matter but

1179.059 --> 1184.539
the preponderance of the gas

1181.34 --> 1184.539
will not do that

1186.26 --> 1191.539
right it might move around a little

1189.02 --> 1194.96
because of the drag

1191.539 --> 1196.7
but it will never match the rotatory

1194.96 --> 1199.46
speed

1196.7 --> 1201.2
of all the other material within the

1199.46 --> 1201.98
spinning Taurus

1201.2 --> 1204.26
so there you go

1201.98 --> 1206.3600000000001
[Music]

1204.26 --> 1208.96
don't think I could explain this more

it doesn't

1222.26 --> 1227.2
gas doesn't get pushed to the end of the

1225.08 --> 1227.1999999999998
two

1228.919 --> 1236.7990000000002
yeah it doesn't get pushed sideways got

1231.62 --> 1236.799
gas doesn't do that akumu virus

1242.179 --> 1245.74
you have done this no you haven't

1248.78 --> 1255.44
if you just take

1250.7 --> 1258.14
a tanker a container and then swing it

1255.44 --> 1260.48
around yeah sure some kind of gradation

1258.14 --> 1262.88
will then form but that's not the setup

1260.48 --> 1267.2
I'm talking about I'm talking about

1262.88 --> 1270.5
a Taurus spinning not a tanker being

1267.2 --> 1274.22
slung that's not what I'm talking about

1270.5 --> 1276.44
yeah in a tanker being slung

1274.22 --> 1278.3600000000001
you have the container walls constantly

1276.44 --> 1280.72
pushing it around on the inside of the

1278.36 --> 1280.7199999999998
tanker

1282.559 --> 1287.86
that's why you need a Taurus so there is

1285.14 --> 1290.96
in the rotatory

1287.86 --> 1292.78
geometry there's nothing to push against

1290.96 --> 1295.22
the gas directly

1292.78 --> 1296.07
and that was the whole point of that

1295.22 --> 1305.84
test

1296.07 --> 1306.98
[Music]

1305.84 --> 1309.58
s

1306.98 --> 1309.58
yes

1310.28 --> 1315.32
that's cool and I mean you can

1312.5 --> 1318.1
centrifuge gases

1315.32 --> 1322.1
but that's different that's literally

1318.1 --> 1325.34
well causing a gradient

1322.1 --> 1328.1
and hey some gases are more dense than

1325.34 --> 1330.3799999999999
others so yeah they will potentially

1328.1 --> 1333.98
under extreme force of

1330.38 --> 1337.0390000000002
centrifuge start to split up

1333.98 --> 1338.72
start to sort of split up

1337.039 --> 1341.179
right

1338.72 --> 1342.679
but that's not what this is about though

1341.179 --> 1345.26
at all

1342.679 --> 1347.539
what I'm talking about the entire item

1345.26 --> 1349.76
here is about whether gas moves in

1347.539 --> 1351.14
lockstep with a rotating reference frame

1349.76 --> 1354.62
and it doesn't

1351.14 --> 1357.14
and that you can centrifuge gases to

1354.62 --> 1359.32
separate them has nothing to do with

1357.14 --> 1359.3200000000002
that

1360.36 --> 1373.4199999999998
[Music]

1375.74 --> 1379.7
your opposing doesn't have what what

1378.14 --> 1382.88
doesn't have what what are you talking

about frl

foreign

1385.55 --> 1391.8799999999999
[Music]

1389.26 --> 1395.419
yeah of course temperature causes

1391.88 --> 1397.94
pressure differential

1395.419 --> 1400.5800000000002
but what does that have to do with my

1397.94 --> 1403.0
setup and the what it was supposed to be

1400.58 --> 1403.0
proving

1403.64 --> 1407.48
has nothing to do with it it's just

1405.14 --> 1409.4
moving away I know it's all very

1407.48 --> 1412.46
inspiring doing actual physical

1409.4 --> 1415.159
practical texts that reveal the nature

1412.46 --> 1417.559
of physical reality I know it's very

1415.159 --> 1420.2
fascinating but what you're rolling on

1417.559 --> 1423.8799999999999
has nothing to do with what I'm actually

1420.2 --> 1423.88
talking about what I was describing

1425.36 --> 1430.52
it doesn't move in lockstep with the

1427.7 --> 1432.799
rotating reference frame gas only

1430.52 --> 1435.799
responds to local air pressure

1432.799 --> 1439.1
differential and that's a fact

1435.799 --> 1442.1
I'd say that's a natural law

1439.1 --> 1445.57
I go that far because that absolutely

1442.1 --> 1448.7199999999998
always happens with all gases

1445.57 --> 1448.72
[Music]

1449.48 --> 1454.299
never said look step yeah but not at all

1452.059 --> 1454.299
though

1454.7 --> 1459.0800000000002
right

1457.039 --> 1462.02
or it's not spinning

1459.08 --> 1464.299
guests wouldn't move in lockstep with

1462.02 --> 1467.799
the Earth even if it was spinning if it

1464.299 --> 1467.799
is actually the earth that is spinning

1471.799 --> 1477.02
right and this is all based on the

1474.32 --> 1479.299
assumption that somehow gas could still

1477.02 --> 1481.7
be held to a ball in the face of a giant

1479.299 --> 1484.82
vacuum right that's even overlooking

1481.7 --> 1487.1000000000001
that part well

1484.82 --> 1490.039
there's no relevance of course to the

1487.1 --> 1492.1399999999999
test that I described earlier because

1490.039 --> 1494.98
that is a closed system that you're

1492.14 --> 1494.98
going to be rotating

1495.62 --> 1498.34
a Taurus

1508.0 --> 1512.0

anything

stop straw Manning away

1514.94 --> 1519.46

1526.34 --> 1534.1399999999999
the gravity is not involved

1531.919 --> 1537.44
it isn't anything by the way anyway but

1534.14 --> 1540.1000000000001
it's not involved it has nothing to do

1537.44 --> 1540.1000000000001
with

1540.14 --> 1545.539
gases

1542.9 --> 1547.52
supposedly being able to move with the

1545.539 --> 1550.46
rotatory reference frame it has nothing

1547.52 --> 1553.22
to do with that it's not even claimed to

1550.46 --> 1556.279
influence it officially

1553.22 --> 1558.559
and that's based on the loose parameters

1556.279 --> 1560.539
of what gravity is supposed to be which

1558.559 --> 1562.76
can't really be pinned down because it's

1560.539 --> 1565.96
just an aberration and they keep

moving the bar

[ __ ] that I've already dispelled

1605.21 --> 1612.5
[Music]

1608.26 --> 1616.84
gas does not have mass

1612.5 --> 1619.76
not susceptible to momentum and it only

1616.84 --> 1622.52
responds to local air pressure

1619.76 --> 1625.46
differential which is only possible

1622.52 --> 1627.08
because there's containment

1625.46 --> 1629.8400000000001
so even a local air pressure

1627.08 --> 1632.299
differential only does anything to the

1629.84 --> 1636.4599999999998
gas because the entire preponderance of

1632.299 --> 1636.46
it is pressing against the container

you need pressure not mass pressure

just like a helium balloon it's very

1855.86 --> 1863.299
everything Einstein did literally

1858.76 --> 1866.299
negated freaking Newtonian mechanics

1863.299 --> 1866.299
admittedly

1866.539 --> 1873.02
you can't then say Oh what Einstein said

1869.059 --> 1877.6589999999999
made Newton's work work again no it

1873.02 --> 1877.6589999999999
didn't it negated the entire thing

1880.58 --> 1886.46
when you got two puzzle pieces one has

1884.059 --> 1888.74
like a thing sticking out and the other

1886.46 --> 1891.74
also has a sting a thing sticking up

1888.74 --> 1894.02
guess what they're not gonna fit they're

1891.74 --> 1896.659
not gonna fit even if you put a hammer

1894.02 --> 1900.04
to it they're not going to fit because

1896.659 --> 1901.94
they're not compatible

1923.179 --> 1928.5800000000002
Einstein

1925.34 --> 1930.4399999999998
formula equivalent to Newtonian

1928.58 --> 1932.3799999999999
non-relative blah blah blah blah blah

1930.44 --> 1937.279
yeah yeah yeah except

1932.38 --> 1942.3990000000001
except it isn't because Einstein math

1937.279 --> 1944.2
gravity no Newtonian gravity are

1942.399 --> 1947.7199999999998
fundamentally

1944.2 --> 1948.799
infamously incompatible

1947.72 --> 1951.679
yeah

1948.799 --> 1955.1
they're incompatible

1951.679 --> 1957.919
that means you cannot compare one to the

1955.1 --> 1961.399
other because they do not match

1957.919 --> 1964.22
you cannot make two puzzle pieces with

1961.399 --> 1969.03
two parts sticking out fit it doesn't

1964.22 --> 1972.41
work they're incompatible officially

1969.03 --> 1972.41
[Music]

1974.02 --> 1979.94
yeah so oh you can equate it equivalence

1977.0 --> 1983.179
oh well if you just think of it as being

1979.94 --> 1986.3200000000002
compatible then it matches yeah but it

1983.179 --> 1986.3200000000002
isn't so you can't

1987.02 --> 1990.26
any more pointless things you want to

1988.94 --> 1992.179
bring up

1990.26 --> 1995.059
MC Banner

1992.179 --> 1996.98

give a [ __ ] what Einstein does or

2024.88 --> 2031.8400000000001
it's the laws of motion yes the more

2028.12 --> 2034.299
laws of motion that exclude gas behavior

2031.84 --> 2036.8799999999999
yeah because you can't apply those

2034.299 --> 2038.74
things to gas gas doesn't respond that

2036.88 --> 2042.3990000000001
way why

2038.74 --> 2046.919
because all of Newton's mechanics are

2042.399 --> 2051.399
all based on momentum type abilities

2046.919 --> 2053.139
susceptibility to this Force yeah gas

2051.399 --> 2057.159
isn't

2053.139 --> 2061.3700000000003
it isn't susceptible it doesn't respond

studied this very specific subject

then

2165.4 --> 2172.9
why don't you apply to gas why don't you

2167.94 --> 2176.16
apply it to gas in physical tests huh MC

2172.9 --> 2179.38
Banner go ahead apply it in physical

2176.16 --> 2181.7799999999997

2179.38 --> 2184.96
it's not compatible

you're a fantasist you've never actually

2184.96 --> 2190.96
tried it out

gas is not compatible with Newtonian

you it didn't it can't

2211.66 --> 2216.7
it's incompatible mathematically it

2215.14 --> 2219.339
doesn't matter

2216.7 --> 2221.68
that somebody said who it's compatible

2219.339 --> 2223.7999999999997
it doesn't make it compatible it is

oh yes oh hurricanes Oh you mean those

things that respond to local air

2265.18 --> 2271.2599999999998
pressure differential

2266.859 --> 2271.2599999999998
and then from the vast pressure fronts

2271.78 --> 2277.3590000000004
that move

2273.64 --> 2278.3799999999997
around in all directions mostly east and

2277.359 --> 2281.5
west

2278.38 --> 2284.02
where the pressure's at huh yeah yeah it

2281.5 --> 2287.98
has nothing to do

2284.02 --> 2291.18
with gas supposedly having inertia or

2287.98 --> 2293.98
momentum it's all gas pressure

2291.18 --> 2296.02
differential on a local level that's how

2293.98 --> 2299.2
it's formed that's how there can be a

giant tornado in one spot in an open

2305.74 --> 2308.9799999999996
nothing

there's wind Stillness yeah that can

2308.98 --> 2311.22
happen

2311.98 --> 2316.78
it happens because air pressure

2314.44 --> 2319.0
differential

2316.78 --> 2323.4
is what actually causes wind to move and

2319.0 --> 2323.4
it's local it's always local

2327.64 --> 2331.92
oh it doesn't mean it has inertia

2332.44 --> 2338.82
this is just more techno Babble [ __ ]

2336.22 --> 2338.8199999999997

2339.88 --> 2346.38
air pressure does not indicate gas has

2342.76 --> 2346.38
inertia that's [ __ ]

2348.82 --> 2354.88
inertia is momentum that means gas

2352.66 --> 2357.94
it goes moving

2354.88 --> 2360.96
then whatever forces it to move stops

2357.94 --> 2364.68

[Music]

with the Skype room

2892.319 --> 2895.54
Einstein and Newton were mortal enemy

2894.64 --> 2896.74
what

2895.54 --> 2899.2
no

2896.74 --> 2901.0
no they didn't actually live in the same

but yeah the fact

2908.68 --> 2915.819
fact officially University level

2912.839 --> 2919.119
recognized fact to the level that's even

2915.819 --> 2922.66
been inserted within Popular Science

2919.119 --> 2924.6400000000003
Fiction is that Einstein gravity

modeling

and Newtonian gravity modeling are

2928.48 --> 2935.04

2948.7 --> 2954.64
would explain any side and why it's flat

2951.339 --> 2958.0
yeah that's easier to make that perfect

2954.64 --> 2960.16
formula than to make

2958.0 --> 2962.859
Einstein and Newtonian gravity

2960.16 --> 2966.42
compatible mathematically it's just

2962.859 --> 2970.2999999999997
undoable that's why it's an Infamous

2966.42 --> 2973.599
Paradigm it's an Infamous problem

2970.3 --> 2978.52
within University communities concerning

2973.599 --> 2981.6400000000003
math and physics they all know that yeah

2978.52 --> 2984.52
watch the movie Interstellar

2981.64 --> 2986.5
they lay it out and then they kind of

2984.52 --> 2989.859
wizard trick you through it but they

2986.5 --> 2993.04
literally said we can't make

2989.859 --> 2994.42
these gravity formulas compatible and

2993.04 --> 2998.7
they show it

2994.42 --> 2998.7000000000003
on the white or on the Blackboard

2999.28 --> 3004.02
and it is exactly that

3001.8 --> 3006.8390000000004
just Einstein gravity

3004.02 --> 3009.9
Newtonian gravity incompatible they

3006.839 --> 3013.2
showed it to you because it's true

3009.9 --> 3015.3
yeah historical fact you need to get

3013.2 --> 3018.8999999999996
over that it's historical fact it's

3015.3 --> 3022.38
already admitted that that's true

3018.9 --> 3024.119
you can't argue with me about me saying

3022.38 --> 3025.92
something that's been officially

3024.119 --> 3031.7000000000003
recognized

3025.92 --> 3031.7000000000003
by a whole class of people pretty much

3033.38 --> 3038.46
Interstellar my citation no it's not

3036.18 --> 3041.22
your [ __ ] [ __ ]

3038.46 --> 3042.78
it's just a reference it's a popular

reference

3042.78 --> 3046.8590000000004
a movie that referenced it because it's

relevant

3046.859 --> 3053.0989999999997
yeah it was still the same situation in

3051.059 --> 3057.079
2010

3053.099 --> 3057.079
when that movie came out yeah

3058.02 --> 3064.819
like 80 years later

3061.38 --> 3064.819
it's still an issue

3066.38 --> 3073.28
don't have to freaking cite anything

3069.54 --> 3076.44
it's admitted fact mechanical

3073.28 --> 3078.8390000000004
mathematical fact it's incompatible I

3076.44 --> 3081.559
don't have to [ __ ] cite anybody this

3078.839 --> 3081.5589999999997

argument right so quickly move away from

this utter Devastation that you've just

3104.7 --> 3110.339
been subjected to with your ridiculous

3107.339 --> 3113.4
claim that Einstein ever said

3110.339 --> 3117.119
and his formula is compatible with

3113.4 --> 3117.119
newtonians ridiculous

3117.48 --> 3121.559
why'd you cite that

3119.4 --> 3124.1600000000003
and then demonstrate it

3121.559 --> 3124.1600000000003
huh

[Music]

3132.78 --> 3136.3190000000004
to look it up yeah no but I I don't want

3135.0 --> 3138.359
to look it up

3136.319 --> 3141.66
by the words I can already kind of

3138.359 --> 3143.52
determine what it is I don't need to

3141.66 --> 3146.04
look anything up

3143.52 --> 3149.22
I know it's not true

3146.04 --> 3153.0
though most of the crap that robot of

3149.22 --> 3157.7
Einstein is not true yeah most of the

3153.0 --> 3157.7
things that roll out of him are not true

3159.3 --> 3162.8900000000003
I bet that that [ __ ] little thing is

that I've never come across any of them

that were true

theories are the most regularly tested

yeah I bet he didn't use it the

scientific method right

I know he didn't an empty [ __ ]

oh Mac it's math garbage it's a reified

3267.9 --> 3274.02
math into physical reality

3270.9 --> 3278.04
I mean Einstein almost single-handedly

3274.02 --> 3280.02
invented the concept of math is reality

3278.04 --> 3282.0
because that's what he did just turn

3280.02 --> 3285.0
everything to math

3282.0 --> 3287.46
and then people still thought it was

3285.0 --> 3289.92
physics because they were [ __ ] and

3287.46 --> 3292.859
they didn't understand the Wizardry of

3289.92 --> 3296.1800000000003
mathematics Einstein did and he [ __ ]

around with it on purpose

theoretical physicist yes oh really

3308.72 --> 3315.5989999999997
[Music]

3312.38 --> 3318.3
what's this experiment

3315.599 --> 3321.38
the scientific experiment to prove that

3318.3 --> 3321.38
he is a physicist

3322.92 --> 3325.579
no

3326.16 --> 3332.04
all I've ever even heard associated with

3329.579 --> 3334.8
him to be some kind of a physical task

3332.04 --> 3336.9
test which by the way is also on record

3334.8 --> 3339.0
stealing from somebody else because he

3336.9 --> 3340.26
did that with most of his things that he

3339.0 --> 3344.18
wrote about

3340.26 --> 3344.1800000000003
the photoelectric effect

3345.42 --> 3350.46
that's like the one of the few times he

3347.579 --> 3352.559
even engaged in any kind of physical

3350.46 --> 3355.079
test about anything

3352.559 --> 3358.7400000000002
because Einstein didn't do most of that

3355.079 --> 3360.78
he never did he was only ever whining

3358.74 --> 3363.45
about math to people that were so

3360.78 --> 3367.38
impressed by it that's it

3363.45 --> 3367.3799999999997
[Music]

3367.88 --> 3373.339
yeah yeah theoretical fist it's an

3370.44 --> 3373.339
oxymoron

3375.119 --> 3382.819
physicist and theoretical are actually

3378.48 --> 3382.819
technically mutually exclusive

3386.099 --> 3392.099
either you're doing physics in the real

3389.7 --> 3395.96
world or you're not so either you're a

3392.099 --> 3395.96
physicist or you're a fantasist

3400.38 --> 3408.0
yeah because the more abstractions

3404.76 --> 3410.4
are inserted within any type of

3408.0 --> 3413.52
hypotheses

3410.4 --> 3415.559
it's just gonna make it broken and

3413.52 --> 3418.2
unviable

3415.559 --> 3421.38
it's going to stray away from the basic

3418.2 --> 3423.8999999999996
necessities of the scientific method

3421.38 --> 3426.92
it's a very specific and distinct yeah

3423.9 --> 3426.92
he didn't do any of that

3430.76 --> 3436.3190000000004
might self-described theoretical

3433.319 --> 3436.319
cosmoginist

3439.319 --> 3444.96
I like to speculate I like to fantasize

3442.319 --> 3449.24
I like to figure out things that I think

3444.96 --> 3449.2400000000002
might be coming sure sure I am

foreign

3452.72 --> 3458.04
tical yes

3455.16 --> 3461.24
but a theoretical physicist is an

3458.04 --> 3461.24
oxymoronic word

3463.02 --> 3470.54
you're a physicist or you're a theorist

3465.54 --> 3470.54
I never said I'm I'm a physicist

3473.16 --> 3478.7999999999997
I like to think of myself as a physicist

3476.4 --> 3480.96
I really like physics I like to learn

3478.8 --> 3485.1600000000003
more about it but I am not so much about

3480.96 --> 3488.16
the Well Physical experimentation side I

3485.16 --> 3489.66
I keep it theoretical right that doesn't

3488.16 --> 3493.5
then

3489.66 --> 3495.7799999999997
that doesn't make me go out and say I am

3493.5 --> 3498.9
a physicist

3495.78 --> 3502.1400000000003
because I'm not I don't actually do a

3498.9 --> 3504.359
lot of physical testing but I do make up

3502.14 --> 3506.64
potential experiments I'm working on

3504.359 --> 3508.38
that so I'm a theorist not a physicist

3506.64 --> 3511.74
I'm a theorist

3508.38 --> 3516.44
and the cosmogony is simply the field

3511.74 --> 3516.4399999999996

AMC banner I don't know if you realize

3563.4 --> 3572.339
it but Einstein's been dead for a while

3567.74 --> 3575.18
before this supposed ligo thing

3572.339 --> 3575.18
so

3575.4 --> 3582.6800000000003
what a weird thing to say

3578.16 --> 3582.68
what a weird weird thing to say

3583.2 --> 3590.16
have you not heard of any of the tests

3586.079 --> 3592.559
of Einstein ligo is a big recent one oh

3590.16 --> 3594.5989999999997
cool did did Einstein direct that test

3592.559 --> 3597.059
did he was he the experimenter from

3594.599 --> 3598.44
within his grave

3597.059 --> 3601.3190000000004
thank you

3598.44 --> 3603.66
if he even has one I don't know I heard

3601.319 --> 3606.44
that they basically

3603.66 --> 3608.8799999999997
took his brain out for supposed medical

3606.44 --> 3611.099
research so I don't know what the [ __ ]

3608.88 --> 3613.7400000000002
is even if he even has a grave I don't

3611.099 --> 3616.44
care it's it's kind of pointless though

3613.74 --> 3618.54
to say it like that

3616.44 --> 3621.359
Einstein's experiment no it's not you

3618.54 --> 3623.819
actually require a living person

3621.359 --> 3628.2
being able to interact

3623.819 --> 3629.46

3642.299 --> 3645.5
how are they doing that

3646.44 --> 3650.42
what was the independent variable

3653.579 --> 3660.6600000000003
or or maybe you mean people are just

3656.819 --> 3664.079
building stuff industrially and kind of

3660.66 --> 3665.8999999999996
following some of Einstein's ideas in

3664.079 --> 3667.92
this and I don't know some of his ideas

3665.9 --> 3670.94
intuitively through the nature of

3667.92 --> 3673.619
mathematics may have been like

3670.94 --> 3676.559
interesting and revealing as to like

3673.619 --> 3679.079
what what you might find right it's just

3676.559 --> 3682.02
it is overarching principles are kind of

3679.079 --> 3683.6400000000003
nonsensical and disproven

3682.02 --> 3685.98
right so yeah sure you could use

Einstein's

3685.98 --> 3690.9
ideas

3688.26 --> 3693.7200000000003

it's just seeing if something correlates

although hey anybody here could look it

3798.78 --> 3801.8390000000004
up

3800.52 --> 3805.319
tell me

3801.839 --> 3807.359
look it up like Arthur B flat or clutch

3805.319 --> 3810.0
turret you look it up

3807.359 --> 3811.859
and then tell me I was wrong tell me

3810.0 --> 3813.839
that that there might be something more

3811.859 --> 3816.72
to it because I'm not gonna look it up

I'm not even gonna

3816.72 --> 3820.7599999999998
like enter it in Google or anything

3820.799 --> 3828.859
but if you guys want to basically test

3824.28 --> 3828.8590000000004
what I said about it I'd love to hear it

3829.559 --> 3834.599
I'm onto something here I know

3832.38 --> 3836.339
like everything that comes from Einstein

3834.599 --> 3838.76
is always following the same pattern

everything

3844.859 --> 3847.94
oh my God

3850.94 --> 3855.7400000000002
right so

3853.2 --> 3858.359
if anybody wants to look up Einstein's

3855.74 --> 3860.4599999999996
equivalence principle and how that

3858.359 --> 3862.2599999999998
supposedly was tested and then tell me

3860.46 --> 3864.859
that that's a viable scientific

3862.26 --> 3864.8590000000004
experiment

3870.859 --> 3874.94
hey dank let's see you

3882.66 --> 3889.02
it's okay

3885.059 --> 3889.02
hey Liz uh

3890.099 --> 3899.57
I think we uh we got it

3893.01 --> 3899.57
[Music]

3919.26 --> 3922.099
what

3922.799 --> 3928.859
you you've got to be kidding me it's

3926.16 --> 3931.02
even worse than I thought

3928.859 --> 3935.24
wow

3931.02 --> 3935.24
okay so let me read this out

3935.76 --> 3940.2000000000003
okay

3937.14 --> 3944.72
Einstein's equivalence principle is just

3940.2 --> 3946.2799999999997
the fact that two sets of equations

3944.72 --> 3948.9599999999996
equations

3946.28 --> 3951.5
reduce to the same thing

3948.96 --> 3956.2400000000002
I was referencing tests of that

3951.5 --> 3956.24
equivalent principle at the atomic level

3957.54 --> 3961.44
but

3958.74 --> 3964.4399999999996
what this Atomic level have to do with

3961.44 --> 3964.44
equations

3965.94 --> 3971.52
seems like it's two different fields

3968.22 --> 3975.0589999999997
don't you think yeah equations math

3971.52 --> 3976.68
information in the mind structure

3975.059 --> 3978.5400000000004
yeah

3976.68 --> 3983.24
atomic

3978.54 --> 3988.099
substance physical matter the real thing

3983.24 --> 3988.0989999999997
hmm not very compatible

3988.68 --> 3993.96
yeah how are you gonna prove that

3991.26 --> 3994.8590000000004
mathematical equations are equal on some

3993.96 --> 4000.7400000000002
level

3994.859 --> 4002.66
through the study of atomic Behavior

4000.74 --> 4005.7799999999997
that makes no sense

4002.66 --> 4009.74
it's incompatible

4005.78 --> 4013.099
yeah math is not reality math is math

4009.74 --> 4015.9199999999996
reality is reality math is information

4013.099 --> 4019.7000000000003
Supernatural

4015.92 --> 4021.2000000000003
physical reality is physical reality

4019.7 --> 4023.859
matter

4021.2 --> 4023.859
energy

4025.28 --> 4028.599
there's two different things

4030.859 --> 4034.339
saying that the formula were

4032.119 --> 4035.48
incompatible yeah and they are they

4034.339 --> 4037.7
still are

4035.48 --> 4039.619
so it's just wrong yeah

4037.7 --> 4041.48
they're not compatible

4039.619 --> 4042.619
Newtonian

4041.48 --> 4046.819
gravity

4042.619 --> 4050.9
and Einstein gravity are not compatible

4046.819 --> 4054.52
that's a officially recognized fact and

4050.9 --> 4057.859
only dim with it fundamentally zealous

4054.52 --> 4061.599
retards would deny that

4057.859 --> 4061.5989999999997
because it's a widely known fact

4069.98 --> 4075.98
it says it again oh really so how did it

4072.799 --> 4079.88
do that then how did it do that huh MC

4075.98 --> 4084.799
Banner oh you solved it MC Banner guys

4079.88 --> 4087.6800000000003
MC Banner just solve the 80 year problem

4084.799 --> 4090.799
of the incompatibility mathematical

4087.68 --> 4093.6189999999997
incompatibility of Einstein gravity and

4090.799 --> 4095.839
Newtonian gravity he fixed it see there

4093.619 --> 4098.900000000001
are literally oh man MC Banner you are

4095.839 --> 4102.04
did somebody get this guy a Nobel Prize

4098.9 --> 4104.839
he just solved the unsolvable

4102.04 --> 4106.5199999999995
mathematical Guardian not here he just

4104.839 --> 4109.219
solved it

4106.52 --> 4110.660000000001
Because he believes it he believes that

4109.219 --> 4113.54
that's real

4110.66 --> 4116.179
what a [ __ ]

4113.54 --> 4118.46
what do you think you're a special boy

4116.179 --> 4120.7390000000005
you think you're a mathematical genius

4118.46 --> 4124.279
that can make two things that are

4120.739 --> 4129.099999999999
incompatible be compatible do you

4124.279 --> 4129.1
wow you must be a real handful

4130.279 --> 4135.92
among colleagues if you even have those

4132.98 --> 4138.08
if you ever even left your parents house

4135.92 --> 4141.219
ever

4138.08 --> 4141.219
what the [ __ ] man

4142.359 --> 4147.14
yeah they are they are and you're a

4145.279 --> 4149.06
[ __ ] [ __ ] for repeating the same

4147.14 --> 4150.52
[ __ ] over and over again when it is

4149.06 --> 4153.259
absolutely

4150.52 --> 4158.080000000001
recognized to be wrong

4153.259 --> 4158.08
you are a [ __ ] sir

4163.89 --> 4167.179
[Music]

4169.649 --> 4178.009
[Music]

4180.04 --> 4185.0
all right so I just I don't know I guess

4183.679 --> 4187.46
we're gonna have to endure him

4185.0 --> 4190.58
blabbering and propagandizing how he

4187.46 --> 4193.52
thinks he's right when everybody that

4190.58 --> 4195.199
has some level of information on what's

4193.52 --> 4198.1
going on in the world

4195.199 --> 4200.419999999999
very easily find out that it is a

4198.1 --> 4203.2390000000005
notorious dilemma

4200.42 --> 4206.179
how Einstein gravity and Newton gravity

4203.239 --> 4207.739
are incompatible mathematically and it's

4206.179 --> 4209.179
not solvable

4207.739 --> 4212.839999999999
yeah

4209.179 --> 4214.76
but oh no MC Banner he knows better I

4212.84 --> 4217.34
mean it's only been one of the most

4214.76 --> 4219.8
notorious mathematical impossible

4217.34 --> 4223.04
challenges of the entire 20th century

4219.8 --> 4225.14
and still stands I mean he solved it man

4223.04 --> 4228.62
because he said so

4225.14 --> 4230.54
set so in my chat so it's true

4228.62 --> 4232.54
right because he says so it is

4230.54 --> 4235.04
compatible it doesn't matter it's been

4232.54 --> 4238.159
notoriously incompatible for over 80

4235.04 --> 4240.98
years he's done it because Einstein said

4238.159 --> 4241.8099999999995
it and that means that it's true now he

4240.98 --> 4243.32
can do it

4241.81 --> 4246.14
[Music]

4243.32 --> 4248.599999999999
how is it not solvable I don't know I'm

4246.14 --> 4251.02
not a mathematician I just know it's

4248.6 --> 4254.719
incompatible and that every

4251.02 --> 4257.4800000000005
mathematician that is any information

4254.719 --> 4261.52
about what's been going down in the last

4257.48 --> 4261.5199999999995
few hundred years knows that

4273.02 --> 4278.360000000001
foreign

4274.76 --> 4281.42
yeah I know PG see that

4278.36 --> 4283.94
but MC Banner thought it was gonna make

4281.42 --> 4288.32
him look smarter

4283.94 --> 4292.219
to basically spout for an hour about how

4288.32 --> 4296.739
no it is compatible but yeah

4292.219 --> 4296.7390000000005
it isn't sufficiently recognized

4296.96 --> 4301.64
I'm not even that invested I just know

4299.239 --> 4304.759999999999
that's the case

4301.64 --> 4306.62
right and I'm not gonna

4304.76 --> 4309.56
like

4306.62 --> 4312.86
like move over that just move that to

4309.56 --> 4315.4400000000005
the side so you can feel all Superior

4312.86 --> 4318.679
with your Fantastical ideas of how you

4315.44 --> 4322.78
made this impossibly impossible to solve

4318.679 --> 4322.78
mathematical equations subtly fixed

4326.239 --> 4331.04
it's ridiculous I mean

4329.179 --> 4332.4800000000005
if it could have been fixed then

4331.04 --> 4335.86
probably

4332.48 --> 4335.86
uh what's his name again

4336.679 --> 4342.38
the original Stephen Hawkins not the the

4339.679 --> 4344.84
puppet but the original one would have

4342.38 --> 4346.64
probably solved it

4344.84 --> 4350.3
and he couldn't

4346.64 --> 4352.280000000001
I think he even had like one of in one

4350.3 --> 4354.14
of his original speeches when he still

4352.28 --> 4356.599999999999
had like actual

4354.14 --> 4358.219
speaking capability I think he even

4356.6 --> 4360.56
addressed that at some point somewhere

4358.219 --> 4364.58
in the 90s or in the 80s

4360.56 --> 4366.320000000001
yeah because it's not compatible

4364.58 --> 4369.8
it's not compatible you need to get over

4366.32 --> 4372.139999999999
it MC Banner you fantasist idiot you

4369.8 --> 4374.6
need to get over it you were wrong

4372.14 --> 4377.12
you're still wrong and now you're still

4374.6 --> 4380.4400000000005
trying to defend how you were wrong this

4377.12 --> 4380.44
is really pathetic

4384.739 --> 4389.239
I mean

4386.42 --> 4392.0
do you even like math

4389.239 --> 4395.259999999999
because with that attitude you're not

4392.0 --> 4395.26
gonna get in any University

4395.6 --> 4401.2390000000005
right they don't let people in that just

4398.06 --> 4404.42
blatantly assert things that are known

4401.239 --> 4406.94
to be wrong they don't allow them in

4404.42 --> 4408.7390000000005
so you're not getting in I guarantee you

4406.94 --> 4410.96
it

4408.739 --> 4413.0
you're just wrong

4410.96 --> 4416.2390000000005
and you refuse to admit it and you're

4413.0 --> 4418.94
just making more garbage

4416.239 --> 4421.4
to surround yourself with and it doesn't

4418.94 --> 4423.379999999999
solve the problem that you were wrong in

4421.4 --> 4427.179
the first instance

4423.38 --> 4427.179
yeah the original Hawking

4427.34 --> 4430.900000000001
the one that actually died

4430.94 --> 4437.48
before they took that other actor with a

4434.6 --> 4440.54
completely different set of teeth and a

4437.48 --> 4441.5
different jawline before they put him in

4440.54 --> 4443.42
there

4441.5 --> 4445.28
and roll them out on stage and all that

4443.42 --> 4447.88
yeah before that the real Stephen

4445.28 --> 4447.88
Hawking

4449.54 --> 4454.88
I'm not nearly as old as you I know I

4453.14 --> 4456.56
know I can tell and that's why I'm

4454.88 --> 4458.179
telling you you're not gonna get in the

4456.56 --> 4461.06
University

4458.179 --> 4462.86
if you have that kind of attitude if

4461.06 --> 4467.96
you're just going to reassert over and

4462.86 --> 4470.0
over things that are known to be wrong

4467.96 --> 4471.14
you're just an idiot is what they're

4470.0 --> 4472.48
going to say or they're probably not

4471.14 --> 4476.0
going to say they're just going to say

4472.48 --> 4478.4
yeah I don't know you might just want to

4476.0 --> 4480.38
go back to regular school first

4478.4 --> 4483.379999999999
why didn't you just get the facts

4480.38 --> 4484.179
straight first before you roll out all

4483.38 --> 4486.92
your

4484.179 --> 4489.38
technobabble nonsense excuses

4486.92 --> 4491.659
to justify why you were wrong

4489.38 --> 4493.6990000000005
in denial of that you were wrong yeah

4491.659 --> 4497.139999999999
because people at universities don't

4493.699 --> 4497.139999999999
really like people like that

4497.239 --> 4505.178999999999
they don't like salacious [ __ ] who

4500.0 --> 4505.179
keep reinserting known incorrect things

4506.659 --> 4510.879999999999
I'm about to finish my secretary I don't

4508.46 --> 4510.88
believe you

4511.28 --> 4514.179
you're a liar

4514.699 --> 4517.759999999999
they're not gonna let you in you're a

4516.739 --> 4520.28
liar

4517.76 --> 4523.76
you got it so wrong I mean if you put

4520.28 --> 4525.259999999999
that on your final paper you're not

4523.76 --> 4527.780000000001
gonna make it

4525.26 --> 4529.52
I recommend against it I mean don't do

4527.78 --> 4532.94
it

4529.52 --> 4535.64
you're gonna have be in trouble

4532.94 --> 4538.46
or or maybe they'll give you a media job

4535.64 --> 4541.400000000001
a high paying media job because they're

4538.46 --> 4544.04
like wow this guy really knows how to

4541.4 --> 4545.96
lie without even realizing he's lying

4544.04 --> 4548.0
and be so incorrect but say it's so

4545.96 --> 4550.94
convincing that he might be able to

4548.0 --> 4553.88
completely break other people's minds so

4550.94 --> 4556.04
let's throw Millions at him

4553.88 --> 4558.679
so that he can be the next Joe Rogan

4556.04 --> 4560.78
piece of [ __ ] to tear down people's

4558.679 --> 4562.9400000000005
minds all around the world I mean you

4560.78 --> 4564.8
might get a job as that but you're

4562.94 --> 4567.379999999999
certainly not going to be like a

4564.8 --> 4569.8
professor at a respected University MC

4567.38 --> 4573.62
Banner because you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]

4569.8 --> 4576.02
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] you get it you

4573.62 --> 4578.48
were wrong you're still wrong and you're

4576.02 --> 4581.179
still trying to back your incorrect

4578.48 --> 4584.12
statement like a goddamn [ __ ] [ __ ]

4581.179 --> 4587.54
who does not belong to even touch the

4584.12 --> 4589.88
door on a university now get the [ __ ]

4587.54 --> 4592.179
out of my chat

4589.88 --> 4592.179
foreign

4595.05 --> 4601.400000000001
[Music]

4599.06 --> 4605.8
good luck with your supposed University

4601.4 --> 4605.799999999999
study absolute buffoon

4623.84 --> 4628.6990000000005
I feel kind of dirty for even letting

4626.6 --> 4630.38
him ramble on that low

4628.699 --> 4633.44
but you know

4630.38 --> 4636.56
I just really like to make a point

4633.44 --> 4640.46
and then show how people that are just

4636.56 --> 4643.280000000001
wrong would rather spend a massive

4640.46 --> 4646.04
amount of time just to re-assert how

4643.28 --> 4647.36
they weren't wrong because them being

4646.04 --> 4651.0199999999995
wrong

4647.36 --> 4653.48
is deprioritized

4651.02 --> 4655.34
in their minds over

4653.48 --> 4657.62
well that they had just have to be

4655.34 --> 4659.78
correct so they start out by just like

4657.62 --> 4662.42
no I'm correct doesn't matter how wrong

4659.78 --> 4663.98
I am I'm not gonna correct anything I'm

4662.42 --> 4665.96
just gonna keep re-pushing and

4663.98 --> 4668.599999999999
re-manipulating

4665.96 --> 4670.699
until the other one Just Tires out and

4668.6 --> 4672.4400000000005
then I'll look smarter yeah that's what

4670.699 --> 4676.699
they do that's what anti-flat Earth is

4672.44 --> 4680.419999999999
doing scumbag of the worst sword

4676.699 --> 4685.0599999999995
terrible terrible people

4680.42 --> 4685.06
that are not gonna have a lot of friends

4685.159 --> 4689.78
they might have people that basically

4687.08 --> 4692.239
sort of worship them oh wow he's such a

4689.78 --> 4694.159
good liar so convinced I'm gonna follow

4692.239 --> 4695.959999999999
that they're not gonna be friends

4694.159 --> 4697.4
because those people would barely even

4695.96 --> 4701.42
understand

4697.4 --> 4704.36
them on a social level

4701.42 --> 4705.92
because people that lie that

4704.36 --> 4709.36
consistently

4705.92 --> 4709.36
don't have friends

4711.02 --> 4715.820000000001
and that's probably how they end up in

4712.88 --> 4717.8
Flat Earth chats trolling

4715.82 --> 4719.0599999999995
and just reasserting their [ __ ]

4717.8 --> 4722.679
religion

4719.06 --> 4722.679
and their incorrect statements

4722.84 --> 4726.56
it's because they don't actually have

4724.52 --> 4728.179
any friends

4726.56 --> 4730.34
because other people in the real world

4728.179 --> 4732.8
are not going to tolerate their

4730.34 --> 4735.679
incessant whining

4732.8 --> 4737.42
you see about things they're wrong about

4735.679 --> 4740.86
and they refuse to admit they're not

4737.42 --> 4740.86
going to listen to that [ __ ]

4762.98 --> 4767.839999999999
one Speaking their mind and their

4764.719 --> 4770.6
convictions yeah yeah they are trolling

4767.84 --> 4773.96
then if they don't actually

4770.6 --> 4776.6
have an exchange of information listen

4773.96 --> 4778.219
to the other or I don't know present

4776.6 --> 4780.5
proof

4778.219 --> 4782.78
no no this guy would rather make a sock

4780.5 --> 4787.76

4912.679 --> 4915.58
example out of him

4933.159 --> 4938.509999999999
ah some peace and quiet

I really hope you guys appreciate it

4954.08 --> 4959.86

let's overstep anything

4960.08 --> 4965.5

4971.36 --> 4977.42
right so if you like what I do

4974.6 --> 4980.780000000001
then please keep me going by supporting

4977.42 --> 4983.7390000000005
me specifically through the PayPal

4980.78 --> 4983.739
that would be great

4986.42 --> 4993.56
I can't really use it I mean I just got

4990.14 --> 4995.42
some remnants money that I can still use

4993.56 --> 4997.04
it like I don't know buy beers or

4995.42 --> 4999.02
something in the weekend but that's

4997.04 --> 5001.0
about it also yeah I got the food I got

4999.02 --> 5004.3
some spaghetti and all that

5001.0 --> 5009.34
but I could really use the support

5004.3 --> 5011.26
so please donate to my PayPal and yeah

5009.34 --> 5013.96
I think that if you do that right now

5011.26 --> 5016.179
it's probably gonna hurt little scumbag

5013.96 --> 5018.1
piece of [ __ ] here too so you could just

5016.179 --> 5022.3
show him

5018.1 --> 5024.88
that is that that it works yeah

5022.3 --> 5028.3
well he's complaining about me e-begging

5024.88 --> 5030.04
even though I deliver I actually perform

5028.3 --> 5032.92
here I do work

5030.04 --> 5034.56
performance work

5032.92 --> 5037.06
teaching

5034.56 --> 5040.06
informing explaining

5037.06 --> 5042.820000000001
so I definitely do deserve the support

5040.06 --> 5045.04
that keeps me going right that's just

5042.82 --> 5047.259999999999
the format you know not all people have

5045.04 --> 5049.42
to have a contract and a steady paycheck

5047.26 --> 5051.820000000001
every month

5049.42 --> 5054.4
to be at work

5051.82 --> 5056.86
sometimes the paycheck is a little bit

5054.4 --> 5059.259999999999
more complicated and sporadic

5056.86 --> 5062.139999999999
and that's my setup

5059.26 --> 5064.4800000000005
so please support me

5062.14 --> 5066.719
that would be fantastic I can really use

5064.48 --> 5066.718999999999
it

5067.179 --> 5071.9400000000005
I mean I still have to hold out for like

5069.34 --> 5071.9400000000005
another week

5072.4 --> 5077.08
so please keep it coming

5074.56 --> 5079.4800000000005
I would really like to see the PayPal

5077.08 --> 5081.9
donation today

5079.48 --> 5081.9
right

5082.84 --> 5088.4800000000005
and as a bonus

5084.82 --> 5092.38
well you'll you'll by doing that just

5088.48 --> 5094.54
stab these sock scumbags because they

5092.38 --> 5096.6990000000005
hate it they hate it when I get paid

5094.54 --> 5100.84
because that means to them

5096.699 --> 5104.379999999999
that I will be continuing this

5100.84 --> 5107.02
that the operation succeeded that his

5104.38 --> 5110.9800000000005
nagging and whining and sock spamming

5107.02 --> 5113.14
didn't actually deter me

5110.98 --> 5114.5199999999995
that it even contributed to the

5113.14 --> 5116.8
motivation

5114.52 --> 5118.900000000001
of donating to me that would be even

5116.8 --> 5121.0
better

5118.9 --> 5123.339999999999
right

5121.0 --> 5125.8
so please again support me through the

5123.34 --> 5127.96
PayPal that would be great

5125.8 --> 5130.3
let me know in chat

5127.96 --> 5132.46
or don't it means there's people

5130.3 --> 5134.08
apparently just anonymously donating to

5132.46 --> 5137.199
sometimes

5134.08 --> 5139.36
but in this case I think that if you

5137.199 --> 5143.339999999999
just said you donate that would be a

5139.36 --> 5143.339999999999
bonus in the face of the

5144.28 --> 5149.699
MC band socks

5146.98 --> 5149.699

5404.62 --> 5408.36
coming through on that

5410.5 --> 5414.9
in your [ __ ] foreign Fiat

5416.86 --> 5420.94
yeah

5418.3 --> 5425.4400000000005
well dude like the whole Euro also is

5420.94 --> 5427.48
like in trouble Friday is payday

5425.44 --> 5430.54
the euro is kind of in trouble I mean

5427.48 --> 5432.339999999999
there is a decent chance I'm not saying

5430.54 --> 5434.44
it's guaranteed but there is a decent

5432.34 --> 5436.4800000000005
chance that the that like the euro is

5434.44 --> 5438.159
gonna like kind of fall apart and that

5436.48 --> 5439.659
maybe even the Netherlands is going to

5438.159 --> 5442.86
step out but I know that if the

5439.659 --> 5442.86
Netherlands is going to step out

5443.8 --> 5448.360000000001
that's probably going to mean the end of

5446.02 --> 5450.9400000000005
the Euro because the Netherlands is very

5448.36 --> 5454.299999999999
financially influential in the whole

5450.94 --> 5456.699
thing in the whole Europe thing

5454.3 --> 5458.8
I mean politicians have given away a

5456.699 --> 5461.799999999999
whole bunch of money of tax money from

5458.8 --> 5464.9400000000005
us so yeah I mean we're invested in that

5461.8 --> 5464.9400000000005
whether we like it or not

5467.02 --> 5471.719
Bank of England says three days uh

5475.06 --> 5477.4800000000005
right

5478.0 --> 5483.76
but yeah in the Netherlands especially

5480.04 --> 5486.5199999999995
it's just that our sickening cartel

5483.76 --> 5492.159000000001
politicians have basically

5486.52 --> 5492.159000000001
given away so much money like

5492.58 --> 5499.719
I mean it's not like American level

5495.78 --> 5502.0
ridiculous spending right but

5499.719 --> 5503.82
on that smaller scale for how small the

5502.0 --> 5506.32
country we are yeah

5503.82 --> 5510.88
ridiculous amounts of money like

5506.32 --> 5512.739
billions billions of euros and [ __ ]

5510.88 --> 5514.78
like in the hundreds of millions

5512.739 --> 5517.718999999999
sometimes bill that's like the money

5514.78 --> 5520.719
that the government our government kind

5517.719 --> 5524.26
of whether we like it or not just

5520.719 --> 5528.04
throws invests into things

5524.26 --> 5531.04
mostly kind of globalist related things

5528.04 --> 5534.179
and it's really

5531.04 --> 5534.179
breaking apart

5538.8 --> 5543.78
so but yeah for now the euro is still

5541.54 --> 5543.78
working

5543.9 --> 5550.0
[Music]

5546.88 --> 5551.5
so yeah I'm gonna have to do that for

5550.0 --> 5554.679
now

5551.5 --> 5557.56
oh what another who's that

5554.679 --> 5561.04
Jesus guys

5557.56 --> 5563.679

it's just money to me is just room it's

5620.139 --> 5623.62
it's room it's really that I'm just

5622.179 --> 5626.38
trying to keep room

5623.62 --> 5629.26
so I can just keep doing what I do not

5626.38 --> 5630.639
let things escalate

5629.26 --> 5635.08

tearing down on anti-flatterers I mean

5650.56 --> 5654.280000000001
it was interesting I think I did a

5652.659 --> 5656.5
pretty good job but

5654.28 --> 5658.599999999999
at some point I just lose my patience

5656.5 --> 5661.86
with it

5658.6 --> 5661.860000000001
that I'm just kind of done

5662.44 --> 5667.599999999999
I think I pretty much already said

5664.179 --> 5670.9
anything that was really relevant

5667.6 --> 5673.679
within the argument that was being put

5670.9 --> 5678.94

weird

5707.159 --> 5711.299999999999
wow that is really weird

5718.179 --> 5723.42
it almost looks like it's a lens flare

5721.06 --> 5723.42
or something

5728.38 --> 5731.1
I mean

5735.4 --> 5740.86

5763.659 --> 5767.139999999999
oh that's not really anybody no that's

5765.82 --> 5768.58
not true bear politic bear

5767.14 --> 5770.679
[Music]

5768.58 --> 5773.139
I mean the majority won't do that

5770.679 --> 5774.639
because they're not fools

5773.139 --> 5778.179
but I mean

5774.639 --> 5780.639
This MC Banner guy did really make an

5778.179 --> 5782.26
attempt and then he got caught up on

5780.639 --> 5785.8
blatantly

5782.26 --> 5788.7390000000005
known to be incorrect statements and he

5785.8 --> 5790.3
just kept doubling down so but he did

5788.739 --> 5793.718999999999
I don't know

5790.3 --> 5795.28
he's been a more decent opposition than

5793.719 --> 5797.8
most

5795.28 --> 5800.8
that have tried that out

5797.8 --> 5803.159000000001
I mean he was better argued than akumo

5800.8 --> 5803.159000000001
virus

5808.6 --> 5814.84
but yeah once you just start to hang get

5811.78 --> 5818.259999999999
hung up on facts that you think are

5814.84 --> 5821.62
facts that are no known to be false yeah

5818.26 --> 5823.360000000001
then it's just after that it's just just

5821.62 --> 5826.199
keeps going and going and there's not

5823.36 --> 5826.199
much accomplished

5832.84 --> 5839.26
but it is yeah but it was over for them

5835.6 --> 5841.900000000001
since 2015. I mean the only thing that

5839.26 --> 5844.4800000000005
kind of kept them

5841.9 --> 5847.78
from just sliding straight down to the

5844.48 --> 5849.58
bottom into Oblivion was the Public's

5847.78 --> 5851.739
ignorance I mean

5849.58 --> 5854.139
the power of religion only really worked

5851.739 --> 5857.138999999999
because of the public ignorance about it

5854.139 --> 5858.9400000000005
right that's how it worked it worked

5857.139 --> 5860.56
because of ignorance nobody knew

5858.94 --> 5862.239
anything then how could you correct it

5860.56 --> 5865.179
right

5862.239 --> 5867.4
well that's different now we're not in

5865.179 --> 5871.179
that world anymore

5867.4 --> 5873.5199999999995
this world the way it is it is

5871.179 --> 5876.4
a bit of a challenge but it is

5873.52 --> 5879.34
relatively so much easier to get

5876.4 --> 5882.0599999999995
informed and get informed quickly

5879.34 --> 5884.5
just gotta figure out how to bypass

5882.06 --> 5886.179
obstacles especially mental obstacles

5884.5 --> 5888.159
because there is also misinformation

5886.179 --> 5890.02
getting shoved in your face you have to

5888.159 --> 5893.638999999999
be able to recognize that or you'll be

5890.02 --> 5893.639
sent off a rabbit Trail

5896.26 --> 5902.1990000000005
but yeah it doesn't work anymore for

5899.56 --> 5903.76
them because people are there's just too

5902.199 --> 5906.239
many informed people and they're not

5903.76 --> 5906.2390000000005
gonna go away

5906.4 --> 5910.54
they're gonna stay informed and they're

5908.56 --> 5913.96
going to inform other people and then

5910.54 --> 5917.199
those other informed people are also

5913.96 --> 5919.6
gonna uphold that defense and that

5917.199 --> 5924.36
didn't used to be like that

5919.6 --> 5927.159000000001
like in the 20th century it wasn't

5924.36 --> 5928.96
balls Universe spin doctor having some

5927.159 --> 5932.138999999999
speech and interesting words then people

5928.96 --> 5934.54
would debate about it why because they

5932.139 --> 5937.4800000000005
didn't really know so they would just

5934.54 --> 5939.1
assume by the standards of what he was

5937.48 --> 5941.199
talking about based on their

5939.1 --> 5943.900000000001
cross-reference knowledge which was not

5941.199 --> 5945.28
super elaborate and all kind of like

5943.9 --> 5948.58
fed

5945.28 --> 5950.739
into certain illusions that well the

5948.58 --> 5952.659
designers of all that want everybody to

5950.739 --> 5954.4
believe and that's how then people start

5952.659 --> 5956.259999999999
to debate about the minutia and the

5954.4 --> 5958.36
details and was he technically correct

5956.26 --> 5959.7390000000005
etc etc etc what are the philosophical

5958.36 --> 5961.42
possibilities that's what everybody

5959.739 --> 5964.12
always does

5961.42 --> 5968.139
until you figure out that the entire

5964.12 --> 5970.12
premise is ridiculous and disproven

5968.139 --> 5974.8
and once you figure that out and that

5970.12 --> 5976.719
settles then it cannot be returned to

5974.8 --> 5979.3
that position where you will

5976.719 --> 5981.699
re-entertain it again

5979.3 --> 5984.159000000001
unless you're a kind of a weirdo like me

5981.699 --> 5986.199
and you can simulate Bowen and then you

5984.159 --> 5987.5199999999995
can temporarily do it but it'll never be

5986.199 --> 5989.08
serious

5987.52 --> 5991.360000000001
because

5989.08 --> 5993.0
still know that it's not a ball

5991.36 --> 5996.58
Underneath It All

5993.0 --> 5999.58
[Music]

5996.58 --> 5999.58
foreign

6013.98 --> 6018.839999999999
I mean when you double down that hard

6016.08 --> 6022.38
unknown

6018.84 --> 6028.08
information that's wrong I mean yeah

6022.38 --> 6031.32
somebody like that if they've gone there

6028.08 --> 6033.0599999999995
you can't earn go there usually once

6031.32 --> 6035.759999999999
people start doing that and feel the

6033.06 --> 6037.8
power of just misassertion and mind

6035.76 --> 6042.42
control like that they don't let go

6037.8 --> 6044.1
anymore so they become manipulators

6042.42 --> 6046.56
and he will

6044.1 --> 6050.820000000001
be caught out there

6046.56 --> 6053.34
placing misinformation again I guarantee

6050.82 --> 6055.38
it he will be caught doing that he will

6053.34 --> 6057.42
tell people this is how it is that is

6055.38 --> 6058.32
how it is when it is proven not to be

6057.42 --> 6061.4400000000005
that way

6058.32 --> 6063.98
I'm not even talking about like earth

6061.44 --> 6066.96
spin or anything I'm talking about just

6063.98 --> 6069.839999999999
registered mechanical or mathematical

6066.96 --> 6071.94
facts I mean if he goes there

6069.84 --> 6073.139
and we'll defend that for an hour

6071.94 --> 6074.759999999999
straight

6073.139 --> 6077.159000000001
his error

6074.76 --> 6079.139
then I guarantee you he's going to be

6077.159 --> 6082.04
caught out there trying to do that to

6079.139 --> 6082.04
other people as well

6082.56 --> 6086.4800000000005
promise you that's gonna happen

6098.219 --> 6105.8

6101.94 --> 6105.799999999999
