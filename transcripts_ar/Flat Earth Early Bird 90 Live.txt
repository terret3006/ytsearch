4.31 --> 12.0
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

8.309 --> 17.189999999999998
early-bird number 90 I'm your host

12.0 --> 21.509999999999998
Arwen and today it's like every day is

17.19 --> 24.93
completely different it's kind of clear

21.51 --> 28.910000000000004
and sunny and cloudy and windy kind of

24.93 --> 28.91
stormy actually just look at this

32.619 --> 37.049
[Music]

37.84 --> 43.25
very beautiful though and it's not even

41.69 --> 47.269999999999996
cold it's weird

43.25 --> 50.14
I I have my heater back there and I

47.27 --> 58.790000000000006
didn't I really don't need it on at all

50.14 --> 63.620000000000005
it's funny how that works so yeah lots

58.79 --> 69.76
lots of stuff going on so you guys may

63.62 --> 73.78
have seen that video that chemo

69.76 --> 73.78
basically brought up to me

73.83 --> 78.95
and yeah that's pretty pretty freaky

84.55 --> 94.6
[Music]

86.119 --> 94.6
so as anyone seen L&B recently

102.75 --> 110.74
so yeah I'm gonna try to keep hmm keep

109.03 --> 115.21000000000001
things as simple as possible

110.74 --> 123.25
let's see your sin Skype what chat bill

115.21 --> 125.33999999999999
G Steve course a JM Agri dwells good to

123.25 --> 130.03
see you man

125.34 --> 132.9
say in the empty matrix chocolate saying

130.03 --> 137.769
furious punch

132.9 --> 145.62
Nathan Oakley see you though Android

137.769 --> 156.15
beat electric meets weird sports chemo

145.62 --> 160.14000000000001
down through the UK dear thanks Nathan

156.15 --> 160.14000000000001
thanks I really needed that

163.68 --> 176.489
I don't know what his issue is really

167.159 --> 179.939
but yeah I did say on several occasions

176.489 --> 183.209
when he was in here like yeah I like you

179.939 --> 187.17
or we didn't it's like hey seems to be

183.209 --> 191.269
the case but maybe it turns out he just

187.17 --> 191.26899999999998
really doesn't like liking me

196.51 --> 205.54
yeah we need an earlier early word maybe

200.92 --> 209.319
you know look in the winter doing it

205.54 --> 212.62
very early is not very nice not very

209.319 --> 216.51899999999998
satisfying because when it's early it's

212.62 --> 218.23000000000002
just dark and cold but yeah as

216.519 --> 222.06900000000002
springtime approaches and especially

218.23 --> 225.7
during us some yeah I I'm gonna try to

222.069 --> 230.129
get up earlier anyhow catch more that

225.7 --> 230.129
lights because I need it and I want it

230.37 --> 237.459
so yeah maybe I will

233.349 --> 241.569
in the course this year do it even

237.459 --> 245.109
earlier or do like a second you make

241.569 --> 247.23899999999998
this hour into the second hour and get

245.109 --> 249.70000000000002
another first hour in front of that I

247.239 --> 255.959
don't know I'm not sure yet could be I

249.7 --> 261.37
could do that probably and to be fair I

255.959 --> 264.01
do feel animal like a drive to do more

261.37 --> 266.889
of this sort of thing but at the same

264.01 --> 269.68
time I feel like yeah is it gonna be

266.889 --> 274.3
just me talking come on I'm not really

269.68 --> 274.66
that amusing okay maybe I just don't get

274.3 --> 276.7
it

274.66 --> 277.879
maybe I just don't get why I'm so

276.7 --> 282.30899999999997
abusing

277.879 --> 282.309
I don't

282.93 --> 285.44
what

288.27 --> 294.099
there are a lot of others out there that

291.819 --> 297.96000000000004
I do enjoy a lot and that sometimes

294.099 --> 297.96
unnerved me a bit

303.59 --> 312.94
like Owen Benjamin and I keeps on doing

307.57 --> 316.13
seems now like a daily video as well

312.94 --> 319.76
then he asked some very very risque

316.13 --> 322.34
jokes he pushes the envelope very very

319.76 --> 330.25
far in a creative way

322.34 --> 330.25
still unnourished me though it's I guess

335.34 --> 342.03
[Music]

337.56 --> 345.55
all right sparse chemo asks for a wrench

342.03 --> 347.789
like what why do you think you'd need

345.55 --> 347.789
that

364.36 --> 370.41900000000004
yep I don't know what it is Owen

367.03 --> 374.61999999999995
Benjamin that guy he is a real comedian

370.419 --> 380.039
and he understands the essence of risque

374.62 --> 384.819
comedy like saying something that is

380.039 --> 388.15
like outrageous in a way but then flip

384.819 --> 392.97900000000004
flipping it around and making it into a

388.15 --> 395.289
joke it's a fine art but I wonder

392.979 --> 396.33
sometimes like can this kind of thing be

395.289 --> 401.169
pushed too far

396.33 --> 403.81
what will happen and yell seriously I

401.169 --> 406.56899999999996
have like criticism on the world in

403.81 --> 411.25
general and I kind of have had have had

406.569 --> 417.159
it for a while and that is it's all

411.25 --> 421.18
amped up so heavily and you can measure

417.159 --> 425.979
it it's not just me being more sensitive

421.18 --> 429.069
than usual know also in a way but if you

425.979 --> 432.12899999999996
just compared the older stuff all their

429.069 --> 435.81
music or the older series to newer music

432.129 --> 440.31
a newer series it's become so invasive

435.81 --> 440.31
so aggressive all of it

443.08 --> 450.729
and I worry a bit for in the minds of

447.96 --> 454.289
the people of this generation like

450.729 --> 458.729
they're being subjected to this

454.289 --> 458.729
rigidness it's like a rigidness

459.759 --> 470.16900000000004
more raw Rob Basic Instinct like

465.249 --> 472.3
impulses including dark things I just

470.169 --> 485.52
wonder is this really good what's the

472.3 --> 485.52000000000004
use of this what why and also

486.47 --> 495.46000000000004
how are these new generations going to

488.75 --> 498.08
overcome this you know look I've been

495.46 --> 503.85999999999996
tricked I guess you could call it

498.08 --> 507.53
throughout my life with with movies and

503.86 --> 509.84000000000003
series and stories and everything when I

507.53 --> 513.8299999999999
just had no idea and just like oh what's

509.84 --> 517.539
this whole amazing story and I'm having

513.83 --> 518.75
a yeah in retrospect after awakening to

517.539 --> 523.0699999999999
everything

518.75 --> 525.26
almost I think it's like oh my god

523.07 --> 527.36
that's such a that's been such a effort

525.26 --> 530.41
now I think like oh my god these new

527.36 --> 530.41
generations like

532.89 --> 535.9499999999999
[Music]

542.74 --> 552.79
and can we stop it can we stop this this

553.82 --> 562.69
this push this amplitude of the tension

564.259 --> 572.989
and what is causing it and I think it's

567.889 --> 577.129
mostly because of I guess corporate

572.989 --> 581.4490000000001
deduction ISM it is like effective

577.129 --> 584.559
results driven methodology and being

581.449 --> 588.549
intense technically I guess

584.559 --> 593.529
statistically grabs more attention

588.549 --> 601.91
forces people to invest more into it and

593.529 --> 605.329
that binds them in their essence to a

601.91 --> 610.91
product or to some kind of exchange and

605.329 --> 615.3689999999999
yeah that would worry it's like it seems

610.91 --> 618.259
all very maniacally efficient and I've

615.369 --> 620.509
I've complained about this before like

618.259 --> 623.289
this corporate I call it corporate

620.509 --> 623.289
reductionism

625.82 --> 644.519
and it feels like financial ism abusing

635.959 --> 647.2399999999999
the nature of humanity does that make

644.519 --> 647.24
any sense to you guys

649.83 --> 659.38
and how do you stop this and yeah yeah

656.8 --> 660.25
the earlier sayings like that's the

659.38 --> 663.13
funny thing

660.25 --> 665.41
like collectively if and when you're not

663.13 --> 666.97
awake like these hints come sprouting up

665.41 --> 668.8299999999999
I don't know where like yeah oh yeah you

666.97 --> 669.73
don't participate in the system that's

668.83 --> 672.88
how you stop it that's how you

669.73 --> 677.44
discourage it this and yeah he had that

672.88 --> 682.06
kind of does do it but will it stop it

677.44 --> 686.2
or will it actually spurred it to become

682.06 --> 690.42
even more aggressive to pull harder on

686.2 --> 690.4200000000001
what remains out there

691.259 --> 697.389
and again it's like the polarization of

694.689 --> 700.329
the sleepers and awaken it seems really

697.389 --> 703.869
that the more awakened the awakened

700.329 --> 708.4799999999999
become and the more they awaken the more

703.869 --> 708.48
asleep the sleepers become

710.22 --> 716.4300000000001
[Music]

712.56 --> 716.43
can't say it any other way

718.91 --> 727.8299999999999
so for me for me personally I just think

723.39 --> 734.3
like I gotta put out my borders I gotta

727.83 --> 739.86
build these walls to protect what I am

734.3 --> 749.27
how I am psychologically what how I've

739.86 --> 749.27
built myself how I want the world to be

749.33 --> 758.11
and I have to contain that and just hope

754.04 --> 761.8
outside the storm will

758.11 --> 765.82
just do its thing and exhaust itself or

761.8 --> 767.1099999999999
something so that after that thinks and

765.82 --> 770.0400000000001
just calm down again

767.11 --> 772.63
[Music]

770.04 --> 774.54
sounds very a theory I hope it makes

772.63 --> 777.49
sense to you guys I hope you get it

774.54 --> 781.42
sometimes things that I say I barely

777.49 --> 783.79
even get it I'm really Ted again always

781.42 --> 790.75
always that the I'm like touching in the

783.79 --> 797.74
dark just try to feel through it try to

790.75 --> 800.14
find some viable Road try to find

797.74 --> 806.32
something that can make sense that'll

800.14 --> 811.72
work and that allow us all to remain who

806.32 --> 814.0500000000001
we are and not be caught off in the

811.72 --> 814.0500000000001
storm

819.48 --> 836.83
see it's like no matter how much I try

828.94 --> 844.12
to keep superficial and basic I just

836.83 --> 846.22
can't do it it's just I can't do it but

844.12 --> 853.18
there's always gonna be these moments

846.22 --> 858.37
where it just happens yeah that's not

853.18 --> 861.6899999999999
forget to enjoy the sunlight smell the

858.37 --> 868.05
flowers see the beauty

861.69 --> 870.37
creation you know its mysteries and it's

868.05 --> 876.029
madness

870.37 --> 876.029
[Music]

880.81 --> 887.8699999999999
yeah Pater familias earth rotation sped

885.98 --> 890.439
up in the Midlands very windier that's

887.87 --> 890.439
Larry's

905.82 --> 915.5200000000001
hmm Rosen tinted monocle yeah Constance

909.84 --> 918.21
she said she got a job like I think

915.52 --> 918.21
almost full-time

918.51 --> 923.49
this yeah this week's Monday so that's

921.6 --> 924.51
probably why we haven't heard from her

923.49 --> 928.44
in a while

924.51 --> 930.81
because he has starting off a job when

928.44 --> 934.2
you haven't had one for a while that can

930.81 --> 939.8599999999999
be extremely exhausting and so she's

934.2 --> 942.98
probably just focusing on the like

939.86 --> 947.4490000000001
getting into it

942.98 --> 947.4490000000001
rerouting her energies and adapting

949.88 --> 953.63
what you doing alright

955.16 --> 960.77
and I hope most of you are outside doing

958.41 --> 960.77
alright

974.79 --> 999.26
oh yeah talk about weird things

993.62 --> 1006.11
sometimes sometimes the world can

999.26 --> 1008.02
surprise me it seems it's it's very odd

1006.11 --> 1010.839
[Music]

1008.02 --> 1013.3299999999999
right Yamaha ski yeah the sufis I

1010.839 --> 1016.32
definitely am familiar with him and I I

1013.33 --> 1020.1700000000001
spoke out about that pretty early on

1016.32 --> 1023.95
like even before Flat Earth on the info

1020.17 --> 1027.55
wars like in their comment sections

1023.95 --> 1030.27
before it all went down and now it's up

1027.55 --> 1033.6
again it's not the same really

1030.27 --> 1039.16
it still had discus

1033.6 --> 1042.329
yeah the sufis is like the more

1039.16 --> 1047.64
enlightened branch I could guess of

1042.329 --> 1052.45
Islam and it's been on all but forgotten

1047.64 --> 1059.0500000000002
yeah the other factions Sunnis and

1052.45 --> 1063.309
Shiites Dave like yeah they are or they

1059.05 --> 1065.47
have been hostile to that faction to be

1063.309 --> 1068.77
fair I don't even know a lot about it I

1065.47 --> 1072.8500000000001
know most of it through my library and

1068.77 --> 1077.47
friends who yeah while she loves like

1072.85 --> 1079.6
every philosophy and books so she when I

1077.47 --> 1082.21
was early on still caught up in these

1079.6 --> 1084.6299999999999
more superficial approach like Google is

1082.21 --> 1087.9
some dangerous

1084.63 --> 1091.98
and she would remind me of sufism and

1087.9 --> 1094.77
then again that jumps back to even

1091.98 --> 1097.76
longer though when my family even

1094.77 --> 1101.1299999999999
brought that for us to me like look

1097.76 --> 1108.0
issues but yeah there's this one thing

1101.13 --> 1109.16
over there and that is really like worth

1108.0 --> 1112.8
protecting

1109.16 --> 1115.5
through the storm something it's it's a

1112.8 --> 1120.54
hunch I don't know if we can I don't

1115.5 --> 1122.43
know look with this crazy storm and I'm

1120.54 --> 1125.1599999999999
not talking about the wind blown I'm

1122.43 --> 1127.4
talking about the storm in the world of

1125.16 --> 1127.4
man

1128.71 --> 1139.049
I don't know how much is even possible

1133.09 --> 1139.049
to end up saving I don't know

1142.04 --> 1154.24
because yeah things will cap get caught

1146.93 --> 1154.24
up in the fray in the storm so it seems

1161.56 --> 1167.44
maybe that is it maybe that is how it

1166.04 --> 1174.8899999999999
works

1167.44 --> 1177.3200000000002
Wow maybe that is what maybe I actually

1174.89 --> 1178.25
already described it and didn't even

1177.32 --> 1182.48
realize it

1178.25 --> 1185.06
right before this that we just have to

1182.48 --> 1188.48
protect ourselves from the storm and

1185.06 --> 1192.95
remain who we are and try to not be

1188.48 --> 1194.72
affected by the extreme affiance

1192.95 --> 1198.5
on the outside that are amping up

1194.72 --> 1204.47
through all media sources even through

1198.5 --> 1208.91
other people that echo it and let the

1204.47 --> 1212.3
storm do what the storm does and try to

1208.91 --> 1217.52
sit through it like sturdy old trees II

1212.3 --> 1220.1299999999999
I can't sit through that storm not

1217.52 --> 1222.43
trying to not get blown over and just

1220.13 --> 1227.8100000000002
wait until it's done

1222.43 --> 1230.5
so it can settle down again and things

1227.81 --> 1230.5
come again

1238.149 --> 1246.56
maybe is it possible maybe

1242.24 --> 1247.85
or maybe we will be forced to enter this

1246.56 --> 1252.4099999999999
storm after all maybe

1247.85 --> 1252.4099999999999
[Music]

1253.02 --> 1261.94
maybe for many it will be too alluring

1257.13 --> 1262.74
or seemingly impossible not to I don't

1261.94 --> 1265.789
know

1262.74 --> 1265.789
[Music]

1267.33 --> 1279.32
but for me it very much feels like I

1270.59 --> 1282.72
should definitely have this wall

1279.32 --> 1285.299
maybe that's what I've actually trained

1282.72 --> 1288.01
for all my life without even realize it

1285.299 --> 1291.48
by being alone so much

1288.01 --> 1291.48
[Music]

1294.0 --> 1306.63
to really know myself so that I don't

1302.25 --> 1313.86
lose the knowledge of myself during this

1306.63 --> 1316.71
storm storm is going through humanity

1313.86 --> 1319.7099999999998
maybe that is it sounds all very

1316.71 --> 1323.07
mystical even to me it's like really our

1319.71 --> 1325.88
win is that it's that the story that is

1323.07 --> 1325.8799999999999
coming out of you

1326.42 --> 1334.41
sounds really basic sound so so basic

1332.25 --> 1335.39
it's almost not very original to me

1334.41 --> 1338.1000000000001
anymore

1335.39 --> 1341.22
like yeah I wrote that kind of

1338.1 --> 1343.23
conceptual story could have made that up

1341.22 --> 1347.57
like 10 years ago or something is that

1343.23 --> 1347.57
really so interesting but

1347.77 --> 1351.52
it's something else when it might

1349.99 --> 1356.98
actually be the real thing

1351.52 --> 1360.16
again you can hear about something learn

1356.98 --> 1363.24
about their workings and still not

1360.16 --> 1366.5800000000002
understand until you actually touch it

1363.24 --> 1372.22
and then suddenly like oh my god a new

1366.58 --> 1374.83
death to it and as you touched it your

1372.22 --> 1380.8600000000001
place within it and how that changes

1374.83 --> 1386.28
everything for your own perception but

1380.86 --> 1392.32
anyway yeah I appreciate appreciate it

1386.28 --> 1401.52
hm says you are never truly alone yes

1392.32 --> 1401.52
and no we are all yet we are all one

1409.96 --> 1415.99
time is yeah 2:30

1420.19 --> 1423.529
[Music]

1425.35 --> 1431.02
but you have to get back to that weird

1428.06 --> 1431.02
news it's just

1433.25 --> 1442.63
in a way it kind of freaks me out but it

1436.34 --> 1445.07
was on Artie let's see I'll find it just

1442.63 --> 1452.44
let's see if it's still there it should

1445.07 --> 1452.4399999999998
be yeah things probably oh there it is

1453.76 --> 1464.48
just I'll I'll just present the title

1458.33 --> 1467.6599999999999
hold on it's gonna be take awhile to get

1464.48 --> 1470.53
this all sorted it's not so easy to

1467.66 --> 1470.53
present things

1472.64 --> 1475.2700000000002
right

1482.88 --> 1492.3300000000002
let's see I'm gonna mainspring it

1487.39 --> 1497.5900000000001
presentation mode there you go

1492.33 --> 1501.37
yeah it's not that I'm taking it

1497.59 --> 1509.29
personal because I have great respect

1501.37 --> 1512.37
for Putin yeah that's just all I can say

1509.29 --> 1517.02
about it but this is just like what

1512.37 --> 1517.02
that's unexpected

1519.67 --> 1527.38
especially because it's also Christian

1523.39 --> 1529.3000000000002
orthodoxy and he seems to be wielding

1527.38 --> 1535.0200000000002
that very well but yeah they got

1529.3 --> 1535.02
permission to do this weird stuff

1536.87 --> 1541.37
yeah the rest is not so interesting with

1539.059 --> 1544.6399999999999
that yeah that pictured is it's like

1541.37 --> 1548.32
yeah okay a bunch of witches are holding

1544.64 --> 1550.97
a mass to support the king basically

1548.32 --> 1556.7
fascinating you know what it reminds me

1550.97 --> 1558.59
off a lot the Arthurian legends but yeah

1556.7 --> 1561.77
they got permission it's like yeah sure

1558.59 --> 1563.539
why not and then even in chat in the

1561.77 --> 1566.0
chat under here it's like very double

1563.539 --> 1567.19
responses like like oh that's just a

1566.0 --> 1570.049
waste of time

1567.19 --> 1572.289
useless Christianity wins in the end and

1570.049 --> 1576.02
the others are like oh yeah see finally

1572.289 --> 1581.59
which is supporting a good cause it's

1576.02 --> 1581.59
just the usual what you expect to see

1581.8 --> 1592.57
but I'm just baffled that this is just

1586.93 --> 1595.77
happening you know in America there is

1592.57 --> 1598.54
some really crazy [ __ ] going on and

1595.77 --> 1603.49
which is over there are like going

1598.54 --> 1606.01
insane sometimes it seems and but I

1603.49 --> 1610.84
didn't expect it

1606.01 --> 1616.24
I wouldn't say disappointed but I

1610.84 --> 1621.1299999999999
thought like Russia would just stay

1616.24 --> 1624.82
exactly as it was but apparently they

1621.13 --> 1628.15
decided they they I don't even know if

1624.82 --> 1630.52
it's a day or if this is just something

1628.15 --> 1633.5400000000002
that's going on and we'll have worse I

1630.52 --> 1640.1399999999999
don't know I don't know but maybe yeah

1633.54 --> 1643.21
they're just choosing the natural

1640.14 --> 1646.75
opponents of the dark forces to

1643.21 --> 1652.15
reinforce themselves it's almost like a

1646.75 --> 1656.34
war on all levels somehow with kingdoms

1652.15 --> 1660.25
and military and weaponry and weapon

1656.34 --> 1663.6
threatening giant weapons but also in

1660.25 --> 1668.68
the spirit realm between religions and

1663.6 --> 1671.77
lies and truth and between the the

1668.68 --> 1674.6200000000001
Wizards and the witches and the old

1671.77 --> 1679.36
religion angles of it it's like they're

1674.62 --> 1680.4599999999998
all joining in to make this complete

1679.36 --> 1682.059
spectrum

1680.46 --> 1684.8600000000001
[Music]

1682.059 --> 1687.9189999999999
that's what it feels like to me it is I

1684.86 --> 1690.85
am quite baffled by this quite baffled

1687.919 --> 1695.269
so I thought I'd share this for a moment

1690.85 --> 1702.98
and now it's enough of that let's get

1695.269 --> 1711.08
back to me oh right the way the red

1702.98 --> 1716.48
triangle I don't know exactly I what is

1711.08 --> 1720.1999999999998
it it's like I think it comes really

1716.48 --> 1723.8600000000001
from the well maybe you could even call

1720.2 --> 1726.74
it from the Tartarian magic traditions

1723.86 --> 1730.25
or blah it's probably very local symbol

1726.74 --> 1732.74
it it's a bit blurry there's no close-up

1730.25 --> 1737.5
of it but from what I can see it almost

1732.74 --> 1740.359
looks like it's a an oak leaf

1737.5 --> 1744.84
[Music]

1740.359 --> 1748.289
with branches next to it or it's almost

1744.84 --> 1753.899
like a crown I don't know it looks very

1748.289 --> 1756.72
very nature II and yeah I don't get a

1753.899 --> 1761.8
bad vibe I don't get a bad vibe of any

1756.72 --> 1765.089
of these people here so

1761.8 --> 1765.089
[Music]

1766.19 --> 1775.94
still weird it is still all weird and no

1774.299 --> 1778.83
doubt there's people going to be

1775.94 --> 1783.95
responding just the same are they're

1778.83 --> 1786.6
being very paranoid about this or are

1783.95 --> 1789.72
just thinking like oh sure it is what it

1786.6 --> 1792.6899999999998
is it doesn't really matter

1789.72 --> 1796.059
[Music]

1792.69 --> 1798.779
and that is kind of what I'm trying to

1796.059 --> 1802.1689999999999
fall back to it's like okay that is what

1798.779 --> 1809.679
is happening then that's happening you

1802.169 --> 1813.3090000000002
know just though yeah go with the flu

1809.679 --> 1815.5590000000002
see what they're doing see what it feels

1813.309 --> 1830.049
like is that okay sure it's okay she's

1815.559 --> 1833.61
bad then defend yourself against it but

1830.049 --> 1838.6
yeah I was surprised that that was done

1833.61 --> 1843.9399999999998
and it it it all again it's so much

1838.6 --> 1848.74
depends on all the angles and yeah it's

1843.94 --> 1850.97
a sign of Liberty to that they allow

1848.74 --> 1853.66
this to be done

1850.97 --> 1856.679
yes

for a while till like yeah I got sick of

1884.44 --> 1893.409
him his attitude towards me and left

1889.65 --> 1895.74
but apparently played mind says that

1893.409 --> 1898.3300000000002

1909.229 --> 1913.159
have absolutely no idea you're gonna

1911.119 --> 1919.6899999999998
have to present more information about

1913.159 --> 1919.69
that not that I particularly care

1920.019 --> 1927.259
because I was always kind of dubious

1922.46 --> 1930.3690000000001
with that guy seem very they very hungry

1927.259 --> 1930.369
for more

1932.85 --> 1940.26
yeah I think I caught him just lying on

1936.07 --> 1942.1599999999999
the spot well here and there it's just

1940.26 --> 1951.66
my cup of tea

1942.16 --> 1959.38
a little indecency yeah so I left there

1951.66 --> 1961.8100000000002
never came back mm anyway yeah you guys

1959.38 --> 1966.4
yeah you can look into that I don't know

1961.81 --> 1969.6699999999998
maybe this just troll or maybe you it's

1966.4 --> 1971.3200000000002
just a crazy new idea that popped up I

1969.67 --> 1973.47
don't know we're gonna have to look into

2018.0 --> 2023.879
I thought I saw a butterfly but it was a

leaf getting blown all over the place I

2023.879 --> 2033.649

2054.24 --> 2062.2099999999996
a gem paganism is an evil deception

2065.149 --> 2068.96
can you be more specific

2070.7 --> 2085.8599999999997
because yeah what out there is not

2080.659 --> 2090.02
somehow contaminated in some way with

2085.86 --> 2090.02
evil deception really

2090.32 --> 2095.2490000000003
[Music]

2096.61 --> 2108.07
you know I just see it like everything

2103.27 --> 2110.47
has good parts that are valuable and bad

2108.07 --> 2114.76
parts that should be avoided and

2110.47 --> 2117.9599999999996
discarded and what I do is I just take

2114.76 --> 2120.4300000000003
the good parts as much as I can and just

2117.96 --> 2125.68
try to piece them all together and

2120.43 --> 2130.0899999999997
that's how I do the path it seems so

2125.68 --> 2136.75
logical yet people still choose to just

2130.09 --> 2139.11
take things entirely and the corruption

2136.75 --> 2139.11
and all

2140.04 --> 2158.97
I just don't do that no take the good to

2144.96 --> 2161.85
discard the bad right yeah I will answer

2158.97 --> 2163.9199999999996
questions it's I have no problem with

2169.64 --> 2179.19
somebody could step up to the plate

2172.41 --> 2184.7
I don't know interrogate me or bring up

2179.19 --> 2188.07
interesting new subjects or relevant

2184.7 --> 2190.79

hey on the flat earth debate people

2363.37 --> 2372.37
advertise for me as well I get a lot of

2366.31 --> 2378.81
mansions and so no it's just I just see

2372.37 --> 2378.81
it as a merry exchange of colleagues

2380.22 --> 2385.4399999999996
yeah and Nathan Oakley is also ace

2394.02 --> 2406.13
man did you guys see the debate

2397.53 --> 2406.13
yesterday with with unorthodox I was

2406.58 --> 2410.36
that was just fascinating

2425.349 --> 2434.65
yeah what else can you say about it it's

2427.719 --> 2438.579
just fascinating it's like a spell spell

2434.65 --> 2442.6600000000003
off the globe and their minds being

2438.579 --> 2448.63
tested being unraveled and as we

2442.66 --> 2451.269
unraveled it the holes the holes in the

2448.63 --> 2452.08
consciousness they start to show or more

2451.269 --> 2454.89
and

2452.08 --> 2458.73
[Music]

2454.89 --> 2461.19
and with some they're just very powerful

2458.73 --> 2464.43
how this works how it jumps around

2461.19 --> 2467.2400000000002
completely subconsciously completely

2464.43 --> 2467.24
like

2468.77 --> 2474.27
in a way it really was innocent it means

2471.8 --> 2483.4300000000003
like an innocent from a madness

2474.27 --> 2491.74
and I find it absolutely fascinating and

2483.43 --> 2496.33
tragic and I do wonder like yeah where

2491.74 --> 2500.95
is that gonna go will that just keep on

2496.33 --> 2507.12
repeating itself forever because it's

2500.95 --> 2507.12
lasting so long it's going on so strong

2510.02 --> 2520.06
and I never expected them then the

2515.03 --> 2520.0600000000004
globus the ones that uphold this weird

2520.119 --> 2536.65
religion and never expected them to stay

2528.56 --> 2536.65
in the fight so so enthusiastically

2548.03 --> 2550.63
that's it

2560.47 --> 2563.95

2577.77 --> 2590.82

2582.9 --> 2593.76
weird isn't it that it's kind of the

2590.82 --> 2598.56
joke of my mother I almost feel or maybe

2593.76 --> 2602.8500000000004
it was the joke of talking for inspiring

2598.56 --> 2605.5499999999997
my mother to give me that name because

2602.85 --> 2607.38
yeah it has so many meanings and now in

2605.55 --> 2613.65
the Flat Earth debate yeah are when it's

2607.38 --> 2616.2000000000003
like like damn even Nathan makes like a

2613.65 --> 2624.36
joke prayer using that name because yeah

2616.2 --> 2628.6699999999996
our win it's really really like it's not

2624.36 --> 2628.67
like that guy was looking for that okay

2630.6 --> 2635.85
yeah yeah it kind of freaks me out even

2632.7 --> 2640.23
it's like no no I'm just a guy I'm just

2635.85 --> 2649.98
a guy okay don't get don't get all weird

2640.23 --> 2653.63
on me but yeah I guess I just have to

2649.98 --> 2653.63
take the joke for the joke and

2654.43 --> 2669.27
then be part of the joke I guess you

2660.73 --> 2669.27
know again the joke's on me I think

2670.0 --> 2676.02
just gonna be so many people laughing on

2673.42 --> 2676.02
the other side

2678.61 --> 2684.01
yeah that's right yeah Peter from Van

2681.67 --> 2690.31
Leeuwen gets it since he's obviously

2684.01 --> 2691.96
Dutch and yes that's the when you

2690.31 --> 2698.83
pronounce the Dutch it's our alignment

2691.96 --> 2701.77
and yeah it prefers to be I guess the

2698.83 --> 2707.46
Aryans in the wider meaning of it and

2701.77 --> 2707.46
wine the drink

2711.8 --> 2717.9100000000003
maybe my mother actually tried to call

2714.26 --> 2717.9100000000003
me nectar of the gods

2719.97 --> 2722.75
kind of weird

2726.98 --> 2736.01
now now pate repeat it's not our origin

2730.82 --> 2738.8900000000003
now that's that's the troll thing that

2736.01 --> 2742.369
they did to annoy me and it started to

2738.89 --> 2749.089
spawn its own life and I don't get it

2742.369 --> 2755.8900000000003
why why me why me and that's like I mean

2749.089 --> 2755.89
but why are people making memes about me

2757.66 --> 2763.81
me me me me me why always means it's

2761.42 --> 2763.81
weird

2765.44 --> 2774.619
all right just sploosh tea in my own eye

2777.31 --> 2787.27
right right yeah and Pete later from

2785.05 --> 2792.3300000000004
Lyon yeah I am proud of the name I've

2787.27 --> 2792.33
always been kind of proud of that name

2793.7 --> 2798.4399999999996
[Music]

2800.43 --> 2806.89
yep legendary super looming perspective

2803.619 --> 2810.6600000000003
I eat hijacking hyena you're right

2806.89 --> 2814.96
seem to be well on the means with that

2810.66 --> 2820.23
but I don't know is that kind of what do

2814.96 --> 2825.7
you guys feel am I somehow more meme

2820.23 --> 2829.81
compatible do I inspire memes compared

2825.7 --> 2833.0499999999997
to others is that it because in a way it

2829.81 --> 2838.27
really is unwanted attention to be fair

2833.05 --> 2841.51
i I hope you noticed that I don't at

2838.27 --> 2843.79
least actively try to like oh oh look

2841.51 --> 2847.0
people seem to meme about me oh I'm

2843.79 --> 2850.619
gonna now full meme blow the [ __ ] out of

2847.0 --> 2858.21
everything to to get more viewers to get

2850.619 --> 2858.21
the no look I just want to be me

2859.27 --> 2863.91
I can never get out of this one

2865.46 --> 2868.5190000000002
[Music]

2872.95 --> 2880.0989999999997
[Music]

2875.0 --> 2883.03
I hate it when my own sense of comedy

2880.099 --> 2883.03
turns against me

2907.38 --> 2913.1400000000003
what that's crazy

2917.27 --> 2925.929
save you butter come or what

2921.29 --> 2925.929
[Music]

2942.77 --> 2948.66
you know the funny thing with you guys

2945.15 --> 2952.71
is that sometimes when I just do things

2948.66 --> 2955.5
not even go on attending or anything you

2952.71 --> 2960.27
guys just start to say these things and

2955.5 --> 2969.57
I'm like what is this it's fascinating

2960.27 --> 2971.67
it's almost yeah how weird is that you

2969.57 --> 2974.2200000000003
know I'm having a life hangout and I end

2971.67 --> 2980.42
up just looking at the chat what's going

2974.22 --> 2980.4199999999996
on there it's like

2980.78 --> 2987.23
I get this real meta tendency like okay

2984.32 --> 2990.92
maybe I should start a hangout and then

2987.23 --> 2993.47
actually life review what is going on

2990.92 --> 2995.2400000000002
and what I interpret that's happening in

2993.47 --> 2996.9399999999996
the chat of the people that actually

2995.24 --> 2999.5899999999997
life watch me

2996.94 --> 3008.04
although the ad that may get kind of

2999.59 --> 3008.04
like a meta feedback loop eventually so

3014.85 --> 3019.9
but yeah you guys are are really

3017.92 --> 3022.36
fascinating to me to be fair like

3019.9 --> 3025.3
especially the guys that I've really get

3022.36 --> 3027.28
gotten to know and the guys that put

3025.3 --> 3032.2000000000003
themselves out there on the show is like

3027.28 --> 3039.2200000000003
wow you guys I believe in you

3032.2 --> 3047.25
I see your strength and I see your will

3039.22 --> 3047.25
to be to be great you know

3055.87 --> 3063.5899999999997
hmm truth is truth and lies are

3059.45 --> 3066.49
fascinating right fascinating or

3063.59 --> 3066.4900000000002
distracting

3067.339 --> 3079.429
lies can be comforting like false hope

3072.14 --> 3083.9
or yeah not knowing about something

3079.429 --> 3088.839
that's really heavy on the soul ignoring

3083.9 --> 3088.839
ignorance is bliss literally ignoring

3091.16 --> 3094.0899999999997
and how

3094.75 --> 3104.2
how much can you ignore things it's like

3100.21 --> 3107.83
you have the acting like you're ignoring

3104.2 --> 3110.9199999999996
it then there is the actually being able

3107.83 --> 3115.92
to let go of something and not really

3110.92 --> 3120.869
care ignoring and then there is the

3115.92 --> 3123.04
absolutely erasing it from your own mind

3120.869 --> 3127.21
ignoring or from your short-term memory

3123.04 --> 3129.7
like okay that didn't happen and then

3127.21 --> 3133.359
there is maybe even worse where it's

3129.7 --> 3139.8689999999997
just completely removed from your entire

3133.359 --> 3144.48
spectrum and you've never you'll never

3139.869 --> 3144.48
see it again until

3145.54 --> 3155.39
they had forces its way back there's so

3152.66 --> 3159.35
many levels on how people do this and

3155.39 --> 3161.7999999999997
people underestimate the talents that

3159.35 --> 3165.5
they have with their own mind in

3161.8 --> 3169.119
creatively dealing with things so

3165.5 --> 3172.94
because so much of it goes subconscious

3169.119 --> 3176.51
but so much it's subconscious of

3172.94 --> 3178.76
everything we are and all these

3176.51 --> 3182.3
distractions out there they all convince

3178.76 --> 3188.75
us it's all about reason and systematics

3182.3 --> 3193.369
and knowing statistics all that well I

3188.75 --> 3196.88
think it's really a distraction from the

3193.369 --> 3201.1400000000003
other 95% which is just pure

3196.88 --> 3205.55
subconscious intermingling of energies

3201.14 --> 3208.67
and intuitively choosing paths doing

3205.55 --> 3213.98
things without consciously even knowing

3208.67 --> 3216.88
it or maybe you can be consciously in

3213.98 --> 3216.88
the know of it

3217.42 --> 3225.26
[Music]

3218.47 --> 3228.73
but it happens anyway because you're

3225.26 --> 3228.73
driven to it

3229.869 --> 3235.65
oh yeah like the sensation like you were

3232.839 --> 3237.91
made to do this that kind of thing that

3235.65 --> 3243.4
isn't that kind of feeling

3237.91 --> 3248.6499999999996
basically just a path being set in front

3243.4 --> 3254.349
of you is that your choice or is that

3248.65 --> 3256.71
just like okay this this is the best

3254.349 --> 3256.71
option

3257.43 --> 3266.3799999999997
and we choose the best option or do you

3262.27 --> 3272.95
not choose the best option and yeah how

3266.38 --> 3277.869
much freedom is then really left I don't

3272.95 --> 3282.3399999999997
know it's all matter you know freedom of

3277.869 --> 3285.3900000000003
choice but it's freedom of choice really

3282.34 --> 3285.3900000000003
freedom of choice

3289.27 --> 3296.52
[Music]

3291.51 --> 3299.2690000000002
all right yeah it is a choice on the

3296.52 --> 3303.93
expression

3299.269 --> 3306.3289999999997
or the apparent freedom of choice is

3303.93 --> 3307.3999999999996
that only an expression of not seeing at

3306.329 --> 3310.9790000000003
all

3307.4 --> 3313.7690000000002
and when you know a lot is it really a

3310.979 --> 3316.019
choice then was it just like yeah if

3313.769 --> 3317.1899999999996
you're gonna do this you're gonna have

3316.019 --> 3321.269
that if you're gonna do that you're

3317.19 --> 3329.19
gonna have that and yeah you're gonna

3321.269 --> 3330.8089999999997
choose the parts where it's yeah where

3329.19 --> 3331.4700000000003
you basically figure that you can't

3330.809 --> 3333.3900000000003
handle it

3331.47 --> 3336.3289999999997
are you gonna choose the parts where you

3333.39 --> 3341.239
think you can handle it seems like an

3336.329 --> 3341.239
easy choice so yeah

3342.18 --> 3347.73
choices can appear to seem completely

3344.94 --> 3352.4700000000003
random if you don't know anything about

3347.73 --> 3357.9
it if you just have to choose but the

3352.47 --> 3363.589
more you know about it the more heavy

3357.9 --> 3371.19
the choice becomes and the more

3363.589 --> 3375.17
inevitable the choice becomes so anyway

3371.19 --> 3382.049
it's super super meta all of this and I

3375.17 --> 3383.9990000000003
hope it makes some kind of sense all

3382.049 --> 3386.7
right Ian Adams asked an interesting

3383.999 --> 3388.91
question have you met a stranger then

3386.7 --> 3392.22
thought I've met him before

3388.91 --> 3395.519
guess what I

3392.22 --> 3402.14
I can barely meet anyone and not have

3395.519 --> 3406.2589999999996
that sensation but it comes kind of with

3402.14 --> 3413.089
with the whole empathy thing once you

3406.259 --> 3416.819
recognize the energy of a person then

3413.089 --> 3420.65
yeah you can zoom in on it and you're

3416.819 --> 3423.95
bound to recognize it from some someone

3420.65 --> 3423.9500000000003
somewhere or

3426.71 --> 3432.029
[Music]

3429.38 --> 3434.4300000000003
it's such a contrast like when I was

3432.029 --> 3437.549
really young I didn't understand anyone

3434.43 --> 3439.8289999999997
anyone I always thought like everything

3437.549 --> 3441.329
is complete mystery to me and people

3439.829 --> 3444.8390000000004
scared me because they were so

3441.329 --> 3447.349
unpredictable and now seems quite the

3444.839 --> 3447.349
opposite

3457.39 --> 3464.2889999999998
and yeah you get the deja Vu's although

3461.049 --> 3467.499
with me deja Vu's not so much to

3464.289 --> 3471.4
remember having them sometimes in the

3467.499 --> 3474.1899999999996
past but not anymore

3471.4 --> 3477.039
now it's rather things that come back to

3474.19 --> 3482.19
me are like Dark Worlds related memories

3477.039 --> 3485.2290000000003
and stuff actual deja Vu's

3482.19 --> 3485.2290000000003
[Music]

3486.51 --> 3500.3190000000004
maybe I think maybe like the sensations

3492.4 --> 3504.96
of deja Vu's were like tapped into by

3500.319 --> 3504.96
yeah by the process that I went through

3505.47 --> 3509.319
so that's why I don't experience them

3508.359 --> 3511.15
like that anymore

3509.319 --> 3514.2
maybe that only happens when you're

3511.15 --> 3514.2000000000003
completely free

3517.03 --> 3526.8
[Music]

3520.92 --> 3529.02
but yeah real deja Vu's rarely although

3526.8 --> 3531.7200000000003
yeah I guess maybe dreams

3529.02 --> 3537.33
very rarely still does have look I do

3531.72 --> 3542.85
still dream sometimes and I do get deja

3537.33 --> 3545.49
vu sensations still sort of but it just

3542.85 --> 3547.91
doesn't really feel like I thought it

3545.49 --> 3547.91
was

3548.72 --> 3551.7099999999996
yeah

3552.54 --> 3555.57
[Music]

3567.73 --> 3576.71
right now guests today disappointed

3572.65 --> 3581.23
would it be nice but I guess I filled up

3576.71 --> 3581.23
the hour plenty

3586.75 --> 3589.78
[Music]

3590.86 --> 3596.59
that's fascinating them to see like the

3593.74 --> 3599.68
clouds are going past really quickly but

3596.59 --> 3602.65
there's like an airplane above it flying

3599.68 --> 3604.87
straight into the wind and the trails

3602.65 --> 3608.89
it's leaving behind we seem to become

3604.87 --> 3611.38
trails they are staying in place so

3608.89 --> 3614.35
whatever wind is going on down here it's

3611.38 --> 3618.37
not up there it's fascinating to see you

3614.35 --> 3620.17
guys probably can't see it but we can

3618.37 --> 3623.5
mr. crappie you're gonna have to

3620.17 --> 3625.9300000000003
superjet me some more to to actually get

3623.5 --> 3628.24
a decent camera so I could on the run

3625.93 --> 3631.81
just set it on my tripod aim it at this

3628.24 --> 3633.7
and then demonstrate it but yeah maybe

3631.81 --> 3635.35
you can't see that plane over there and

3633.7 --> 3637.6299999999997
the contrails

3635.35 --> 3640.5099999999998
they just stay in place over there while

3637.63 --> 3645.73
these clouds are moving by it's such a

3640.51 --> 3648.8700000000003
rapid pace the line the planes leaving

3645.73 --> 3648.87
behind is just staying there

3651.93 --> 3654.74
anyway

3656.59 --> 3664.2400000000002
as well as such a mysterious place every

3662.38 --> 3668.6800000000003
time we think we found some kind of

3664.24 --> 3673.3599999999997
structure to explain it all then there's

3668.68 --> 3677.8799999999997
always more more things like no you

3673.36 --> 3677.88
probably still missed most of it

3721.22 --> 3732.6189999999997
so yeah sorry for stalling I I will

3727.53 --> 3732.619
round out the show it's been interesting

3737.24 --> 3745.819
yeah I will be back tomorrow with flat

3740.91 --> 3745.819
earth early-bird number 91

3746.86 --> 3751.05
and hope to see you there

3751.809 --> 3757.46

3755.27 --> 3763.49
subscribed already then please subscribe

3763.49 --> 3768.339
you liked it download it if you draw or

3765.829 --> 3771.02
whatever I don't care for these a vote

3768.339 --> 3773.45
although it seems that YouTube is now

3771.02 --> 3779.75
declaring down votes to be hate speech

3773.45 --> 3783.5589999999997
yeah who cares it's like maybe like up

3779.75 --> 3786.049
the political corner and they care so

3783.559 --> 3794.2400000000002
much what does it really matter down

3786.049 --> 3796.069
here anyway do vote on my video one way

3794.24 --> 3797.72
or the other and yeah if you want to be
