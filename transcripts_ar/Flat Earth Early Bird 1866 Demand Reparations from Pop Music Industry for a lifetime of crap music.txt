streams makes no freaking

468.06 --> 474.759
[Music]

475.52 --> 481.31899999999996

my OBS screen because otherwise I can't

484.28 --> 489.79999999999995

499.28 --> 504.19899999999996
to do a

500.479 --> 508.24
stream and it just keeps doing

504.199 --> 511.24
this every time every time I start on

508.24 --> 511.24
time

511.919 --> 516.0
when I start when I'm supposed to that's

513.839 --> 518.719
when it does this if I start an hour

516.0 --> 522.279
later it just doesn't do it it only does

518.719 --> 525.0400000000001
it when I'm supposed to be live now you

522.279 --> 527.72

[Music]

579.519 --> 583.9590000000001

it with chrome and it's not doing it

all right well yeah it seems to be

662.839 --> 666.9590000000001
completely the Firefox that's doing

669.399 --> 674.56
this

671.839 --> 677.24
right guess in that case [ __ ] you

674.56 --> 679.4799999999999
Firefox I guess I'll just not use you

677.24 --> 681.6
for YouTube streams anymore you're just

679.48 --> 684.9590000000001
completely unreliable

681.6 --> 687.9590000000001
now okay let's check the temperature

684.959 --> 690.6389999999999

709.32 --> 717.519

[Music]

762.24 --> 766.16
YouTube is

764.32 --> 769.32
racist

why is

774.12 --> 777.839
it I don't see what my race has to do

777.04 --> 779.56
with

777.839 --> 782.639
it

779.56 --> 784.8
I don't think YouTube even really knows

782.639 --> 786.44
how to figure out what the hell my race

784.8 --> 789.8
even

786.44 --> 793.12
is not exactly the most straightforward

789.8 --> 793.12
blueprint if you know what I

795.76 --> 801.48
mean

798.71 --> 806.839
[Music]

801.48 --> 810.76

happiest country is that true

1280.32 --> 1286.8799999999999
no that's totally

1284.4 --> 1289.48
absurd I don't know where you read that

1286.88 --> 1292.96
but that's like a an overt lie I mean

1289.48 --> 1294.88
Finland is like among the more depressed

1292.96 --> 1299.24
countries in the world like all those

1294.88 --> 1299.24
really Northern countries are this

1314.24 --> 1318.799
to test me or

1316.08 --> 1321.039
something trying to test if I'll just go

1318.799 --> 1323.799

1459.799 --> 1464.679
just get ticked off and then they're

1461.64 --> 1469.2
just like Jim Bob did and he should be

1464.679 --> 1471.72
ashamed of it just may is life about

1469.2 --> 1476.96
just whining about another person like

1471.72 --> 1482.44
I'm not doing that I will never do

1476.96 --> 1487.72
that I'd rather die than do

1482.44 --> 1491.2
that because I am so horrendously

1487.72 --> 1494.1200000000001
repulsed by that behavior in General on

1491.2 --> 1496.919
the internet that people do that it's a

1494.12 --> 1498.9599999999998
gigantic disappointment every single

1496.919 --> 1502.1200000000001

1498.96 --> 1506.679
it's a bad mark and it doesn't go

1502.12 --> 1506.6789999999999
away and then people just keep doing

1509.64 --> 1514.76
it hard to know what you want to talk

1512.36 --> 1517.84
about no it's

1514.76 --> 1521.12
cool it's just the article is obviously

1517.84 --> 1521.12
wrong just

1521.2 --> 1526.679
saying and I backed it with some basic

1524.279 --> 1528.48
argumentation I mean it's all about the

1526.679 --> 1530.799
sunlight

1528.48 --> 1533.08
right and Finland doesn't have an

1530.799 --> 1536.8799999999999
abundance of

1533.08 --> 1538.399
sunlight so there's going to be not so

1536.88 --> 1540.64
much

1538.399 --> 1543.399
happiness well maybe in the summer

1540.64 --> 1543.3990000000001

[Music]

1569.2 --> 1574.0
really

1571.0 --> 1574.0
that's

1574.64 --> 1580.3200000000002
not yeah

1577.76 --> 1582.32
whatever I would have said not very

1580.32 --> 1586.039
Christian but then again yeah that

1582.32 --> 1586.039
doesn't seem to be too much of an

1586.6 --> 1590.1999999999998
issue but uh yeah that's something I

1589.12 --> 1593.1999999999998
wouldn't

1590.2 --> 1593.2
do

1594.62 --> 1601.84
[Music]

1597.159 --> 1604.8400000000001
damn it's extremely Sunny most of be

1601.84 --> 1604.84
really

1606.96 --> 1609.96
what

1615.0 --> 1621.159
how how is that possible

1618.96 --> 1627.24
are you saying Canada like has more

1621.159 --> 1627.24
sunlight than the European and Asian

1631.24 --> 1634.76
North that's kind of

1636.84 --> 1642.48
weird like how's that supposed to work o

1644.44 --> 1650.88
sunlight hey clutch good to see you

1648.86 --> 1655.8799999999999
[Music]

1650.88 --> 1657.5200000000002
so it has more how what how is that how

1655.88 --> 1660.3600000000001
does that make

1657.52 --> 1662.08
sense why would it have more

1660.36 --> 1668.799
sunlight

1662.08 --> 1668.799
what I mean not on Coast oh

1675.12 --> 1679.5189999999998
okay oh

1680.24 --> 1686.08
central part dry

1683.12 --> 1690.6399999999999
Sun Dry

1686.08 --> 1693.6399999999999
C but why though how how is it that

1690.64 --> 1693.64
there is more light

1698.44 --> 1706.279
there or is it just clear sky all the

1702.519 --> 1706.279
time like how does that

1706.44 --> 1709.44
work

1711.559 --> 1717.84
because I'm pretty sure in north of

1713.12 --> 1720.4399999999998
Russia and Finland and Norway and and

1717.84 --> 1723.24
all that like they don't have an

1720.44 --> 1723.24
abundance of

1723.88 --> 1727.519
sunlight as far as I

1727.84 --> 1733.72
know so I don't understand how how can

1730.72 --> 1733.72
Canada have more

1736.08 --> 1741.279
light how does does that

1739.13 --> 1744.5590000000002
[Music]

1741.279 --> 1744.559
work no

1746.36 --> 1751.1999999999998
mountains not more by

1751.36 --> 1755.4799999999998
hour just more sunny

1758.0 --> 1764.32
days yeah but H so it is like

1762.24 --> 1767.519
meteorological it's like the weather

1764.32 --> 1769.72
patterns there just bring more sunny

1767.519 --> 1773.08
days is what you're

1769.72 --> 1776.6000000000001
saying that's kind of

1773.08 --> 1780.1999999999998
interesting like why though you

1776.6 --> 1780.1999999999998
know that's kind of

1786.76 --> 1794.36
odd not all of Canada no I can

1791.08 --> 1798.48
imagine so there is like this sort

1794.36 --> 1800.9599999999998
of L laan Central part in Canada where

1798.48 --> 1803.48
it's just unusually

1803.48 --> 1809.64

1845.279 --> 1848.6
thanks good to

1851.96 --> 1858.96
know so it's mostly just bright cold and

1855.96 --> 1860.08
bright so so you get blinded a lot

1858.96 --> 1862.6000000000001
that's what you're

1860.08 --> 1865.08
saying is it like a different type of

1862.6 --> 1868.399
light

1865.08 --> 1870.6789999999999
too cuz I I heard that at the polar

1868.399 --> 1872.4399999999998
regions whatever I don't know now if

1870.679 --> 1875.679
that's really

1872.44 --> 1878.3600000000001
reliable that there's like more UV light

1875.679 --> 1878.3600000000001
and less

1880.36 --> 1884.639
infrared I don't know if that's actually

1886.159 --> 1889.159
true

1906.08 --> 1909.559

anyway so you got issues with the

2394.68 --> 2399.96
chat yeah I don't know what's going on

2397.44 --> 2401.96
maybe it's the browser though I I

2399.96 --> 2405.16
literally switch

2401.96 --> 2408.64
to uh what's the Google thing again

2405.16 --> 2410.5989999999997
Chrome and it's no more camera freezes

2408.64 --> 2415.04

2410.599 --> 2415.04
something jat seems to be working

2418.24 --> 2425.16
fine hey Rick

2421.0 --> 2425.16
back hey it's been a while good to see

2425.359 --> 2428.359
you

2442.56 --> 2445.92
being too long hope things are

2446.16 --> 2449.3999999999996
good I

2450.24 --> 2455.319
guess I

2451.92 --> 2459.0
mean I'm destitute I'm

2455.319 --> 2461.96
cranky I left fed I'm surrounded and

2459.0 --> 2464.2
sworn by trolls wherever I go and I mean

2461.96 --> 2466.8
wherever I

2464.2 --> 2471.64
go

2466.8 --> 2471.6400000000003
so you figure out where I'm

2473.24 --> 2478.8799999999997
at I'm not destitute but I am like

2475.8 --> 2481.3590000000004
freaking broken it's it's

2478.88 --> 2484.599
[Music]

2481.359 --> 2487.19
tough like even with the supports like

2484.599 --> 2492.3590000000004
barely coping

2487.19 --> 2492.359
[Music]

2493.4 --> 2499.2000000000003
all right so I think for now I'm just

2496.8 --> 2502.319
like going to quit smoking

2499.2 --> 2505.48
entirely cannabis because it just it's

2502.319 --> 2508.04
not doable anymore and tobacco is just

2505.48 --> 2510.48
disgusting just very hard to suddenly

2508.04 --> 2511.7599999999998
quit with it but like I just don't have

2510.48 --> 2513.839
a

2511.76 --> 2518.119
choice like

2513.839 --> 2521.4
yeah Society has for me I don't have a

2518.119 --> 2524.8
choice it's always it's always for the

2521.4 --> 2527.599
best right when because of financial

2524.8 --> 2530.1600000000003
reasons you just get forced to quit

2527.599 --> 2532.6800000000003
substances I mean that's always that

2530.16 --> 2536.04
never leaves any scars or anything when

2532.68 --> 2536.04
that happens to people

2543.24 --> 2548.5589999999997
right A New Start away from fed no it's

2546.839 --> 2551.5589999999997
not really a new

2548.559 --> 2553.76
start I'm still doing my show I'm still

2551.559 --> 2556.3590000000004
doing it the way I do it and the way I

2553.76 --> 2559.0400000000004
want to do it which I always

2556.359 --> 2562.2799999999997
have I do my show the way I want to do

2559.04 --> 2564.48
it that's how I do it nobody tells me

2562.28 --> 2567.92
what to do like if Nathan has some new

2564.48 --> 2571.16
ideas on how to do things like I

2567.92 --> 2574.079
don't do that it's

2571.16 --> 2577.44
not his yet it's not my

2574.079 --> 2580.6400000000003
show like oh he judges just thinks I'm

2577.44 --> 2582.559
literally saying go [ __ ] yourself when

2580.64 --> 2585.92
he does that it's like yeah that's very

2582.559 --> 2587.559
cute you go do that I'm not doing that I

2585.92 --> 2590.16
have been even when I was there it's

2587.559 --> 2593.559
like yeah that's super cute that you

2590.16 --> 2596.52
like to do that I do different things

2593.559 --> 2601.52
yeah cuz there's no bloody point for me

2596.52 --> 2601.52
to do any of that I'm not your

2604.24 --> 2609.9199999999996
robot is the way not good for you yeah

2606.88 --> 2609.92
I'll be the judge of

2611.0 --> 2615.04
that it does things for

2618.96 --> 2624.319
[Music]

2621.319 --> 2624.319
me

2630.48 --> 2636.16
yeah like I know what it is not smoking

2633.559 --> 2639.7200000000003
weed I had a whole long period where I

2636.16 --> 2643.2
didn't do that for 5 years which for me

2639.72 --> 2645.9199999999996
is very long and those 5 years were

2643.2 --> 2649.839
literally like the most miserable years

2645.92 --> 2653.76
I've ever experienced and it didn't end

2649.839 --> 2653.7599999999998
like it never stopped being

2658.92 --> 2665.0
miserable it's

2662.0 --> 2668.2
just I don't know you could see it like

2665.0 --> 2671.92
this if I stop smoking weat then it just

2668.2 --> 2675.8799999999997
really feels like it sucks to be me it

2671.92 --> 2675.88
just I become overly aware of

2676.48 --> 2680.68
like like I'm not going

2682.48 --> 2689.4
anywhere yeah you think that if I stop

2685.72 --> 2693.2799999999997
oh I'll just stop using Canabis oh yeah

2689.4 --> 2698.4
Society will just welcome in oh yeah

2693.28 --> 2699.6800000000003
sure they will oh yeah yeah no no

2698.4 --> 2702.48
absolutely

2699.68 --> 2704.52
not Society doesn't give a [ __ ] whether

2702.48 --> 2706.92
I smoke or

2704.52 --> 2710.48
[Music]

2706.92 --> 2710.48
not they don't want

2710.52 --> 2715.14
[Music]

2716.079 --> 2721.96
me you cut it back for personal reasons

2719.359 --> 2726.04
yeah of course I mean you can go wrong

2721.96 --> 2729.16
with it but I mean I've smoked more than

2726.04 --> 2729.16
half my life

2729.44 --> 2734.4
and I know how to deal with it it can be

2732.559 --> 2736.6800000000003
a bit of a

2734.4 --> 2740.88
challenge but I

2736.68 --> 2743.3999999999996
mean it is it has absolutely made my

2740.88 --> 2746.2000000000003
life more interesting and it has

2743.4 --> 2746.2000000000003
assisted me

2747.52 --> 2751.599
in dream walking

2754.28 --> 2759.1600000000003
basically in a gaining weird insights

2758.079 --> 2764.2000000000003
about

2759.16 --> 2767.359
things yeah I mean if I stop smoking a

2764.2 --> 2770.52
lot of all that esoteric talk I do it

2767.359 --> 2773.0789999999997
all goes away and it doesn't come

2770.52 --> 2775.44
back because it just doesn't appeal to

2773.079 --> 2775.44
me at

2776.86 --> 2782.76
[Music]

2778.72 --> 2783.9599999999996
all like those senses like I just stop

2782.76 --> 2788.6800000000003
caring about

2783.96 --> 2788.68
it and I stop caring about most

2790.44 --> 2794.4
things all right I'm going to get my

2814.8 --> 2817.8
Illuminati

2863.04 --> 2868.0
right so that's what you can expect of

2864.96 --> 2870.92
me if you think I'm doing oh I'll be so

2868.0 --> 2873.2
much better if I quit cannabis well

2870.92 --> 2877.44
there's a very specific set of things

2873.2 --> 2880.4399999999996
that will happen there yeah

2877.44 --> 2884.2000000000003
first off I will stop caring about a lot

2880.44 --> 2886.839
of things and then I won't have any

2884.2 --> 2890.48
emotion anym anymore at all in my

2886.839 --> 2893.0789999999997
expression I'll be completely apathetic

2890.48 --> 2895.839
and like yeah

2893.079 --> 2897.88
whatever like I don't care

2895.839 --> 2900.44
anymore that's what

2897.88 --> 2904.04
happens been sitting through it for 5

2900.44 --> 2908.64
years it was kind of peaceful in a way

2904.04 --> 2912.2
but i l was like if I get firebombed

2908.64 --> 2916.4
with napom and everybody else I'll laugh

2912.2 --> 2919.4399999999996
out loud at that point that's how that

2916.4 --> 2922.319
felt yeah it's just like you don't care

2919.44 --> 2925.119
about anything

2922.319 --> 2927.0
anymore like about what happens to me

2925.119 --> 2930.28
about what happens to other people like

2927.0 --> 2930.28
I just stopped caring

2934.599 --> 2937.599
then

2939.47 --> 2942.5499999999997
[Music]

2946.77 --> 2951.319

cheers second hand yeah that is gross I

2954.799 --> 2962.0

2962.0 --> 2967.16

2967.16 --> 2973.48
though you can't even smoke tobacco

2970.28 --> 2976.2400000000002
anymore in in coffee shops which is like

2973.48 --> 2979.76
insane like how the [ __ ] did they ever

2976.24 --> 2983.319
pull that [ __ ] that's just messed

2979.76 --> 2986.44
up right but definit I don't like it I

2983.319 --> 2989.2799999999997

I'm on my bicycle or whatever outside I

2989.28 --> 2995.1600000000003
don't like that at all I don't want that

2992.799 --> 2997.559
I'm very much against that like I think

2995.16 --> 2999.64
those people should actually like get

2997.559 --> 3003.6400000000003
fines and

2999.64 --> 3006.2
[ __ ] like no no [ __ ] smoking in

3003.64 --> 3007.839
public like you do it on your balcony

3006.2 --> 3012.8799999999997
you do it in your back Garden or

3007.839 --> 3016.68
whatever that's one thing but not on the

3012.88 --> 3021.44
sidewalk not in a

3016.68 --> 3024.0789999999997
busy shopping street no [ __ ] off you

3021.44 --> 3024.079

3024.2 --> 3032.0
fine I hate it when the people do that I

3029.04 --> 3032.0
I genuinely hate

3034.48 --> 3039.76
it do my neighbors smell my weed on my

3037.359 --> 3043.2
balcony I'm sure they

3039.76 --> 3048.079
do I smell other people's weed here as

3043.2 --> 3048.0789999999997
well from other neighbors that do it

3050.2 --> 3057.9199999999996
yeah is what it is try not to get in

[Music]

3067.88 --> 3073.76
it but yeah I

3070.599 --> 3077.28
mean I wouldn't give a [ __ ] either way

3073.76 --> 3081.2400000000002
cuz I do it for me I try to stay out of

3077.28 --> 3084.76
people's hair but I I yeah I am going to

3081.24 --> 3086.8799999999997

3084.76 --> 3090.44
people have trouble with that well go

3086.88 --> 3090.44
[ __ ] them I don't

3090.599 --> 3096.559

3093.68 --> 3096.5589999999997
will do

3103.92 --> 3108.04
that oh all right see you later

3110.319 --> 3117.359
Buck forgot my wallet it must be theel

3113.799 --> 3117.359
effect it's okay

3117.44 --> 3123.52
derer coffee shops are in public yeah

3119.92 --> 3128.2400000000002
for buying it and the I mean a coffee

3123.52 --> 3129.48
shop that's a room with like ventilation

3128.24 --> 3131.839
and

3129.48 --> 3135.92
everything and then you can smoke in

3131.839 --> 3139.5589999999997
that specific room it's not like on the

3135.92 --> 3143.7200000000003
balcony at a table Yeah coffee shops

3139.559 --> 3146.559
don't have tables where you sit outside

3143.72 --> 3148.9199999999996
smoking I mean that would kind of be

3146.559 --> 3151.88
nice actually but I mean you could just

3148.92 --> 3155.2000000000003
can't do that on the street you would

3151.88 --> 3157.1600000000003
have to have like some internal Garden

3155.2 --> 3160.04
thing or something that would be amazing

3157.16 --> 3161.68
if you could just have like a building

3160.04 --> 3163.52
and then you have like on the inside of

3161.68 --> 3166.0789999999997
the building you have like an internal

3163.52 --> 3168.88
Garden where you can just have tables

3166.079 --> 3171.3590000000004
and chairs and just like smoke a joint I

3168.88 --> 3174.1600000000003
mean that is amazing that would be a

3171.359 --> 3176.88
great place I mean people would love to

3174.16 --> 3179.319
go there and do that

3176.88 --> 3182.319
right but you can't just have

3179.319 --> 3185.7599999999998
that open to the

3182.319 --> 3189.7599999999998
street cuz people will be bothered by it

3185.76 --> 3191.6400000000003
and it will like show people using drugs

3189.76 --> 3195.7990000000004
effectively and you shouldn't you

3191.64 --> 3197.7599999999998
shouldn't do that publicly like ever bro

3195.799 --> 3199.48
I don't think people should even be

3197.76 --> 3203.0400000000004
using

3199.48 --> 3205.799
pharmacutical stuff from the doctor in

3203.04 --> 3208.72
public yeah

3205.799 --> 3211.119
I think that should be treated the

3208.72 --> 3213.0
same like oh you're on this pill or

3211.119 --> 3214.4

4214.159 --> 4218.5199999999995
music yeah that'll that should do for

4222.64 --> 4225.64
now

4242.28 --> 4248.8
no I don't make music I'm not into music

4245.0 --> 4251.159
like that I listen music and I when I

4248.8 --> 4255.76
listen music you know how I do

4251.159 --> 4258.4
it I figure out who around how much of

4255.76 --> 4261.679
the music do I want to hear and then I

4258.4 --> 4265.32
balance like how loud I make it to

4261.679 --> 4269.76
ensure as number one priority that

4265.32 --> 4269.759999999999
nobody else can be bothered by

4273.719 --> 4280.64
it like I'm not going to have to pay any

4276.88 --> 4285.2390000000005
reparations for music damages to people

4280.64 --> 4289.96
because I always make sure that I don't

4285.239 --> 4294.0
bother people with my music unlike the

4289.96 --> 4294.0
majority of all other people in the

4298.88 --> 4302.789
[Music]

4306.28 --> 4312.719
world I'm talking about not oh all music

4310.239 --> 4315.36
Bad ban all music no I'm talking about

4312.719 --> 4318.52
being forced to sit through really

4315.36 --> 4322.36
shitty music and you can't turn it off

4318.52 --> 4322.360000000001
yeah that's what I'm talking

4324.6 --> 4333.0
about like I think

4328.04 --> 4336.32
that this is H I'm now thinking what if

4333.0 --> 4336.32
she that like

4338.28 --> 4343.239
a yeah no it's not that's not going to

4341.159 --> 4345.719
be popular I'm I was going to use the

4343.239 --> 4348.759999999999
word tax and that is just immediately

4345.719 --> 4352.12
going to go wrong but I was thinking

4348.76 --> 4355.320000000001
like what about a social engineering tax

4352.12 --> 4359.0
if your music is like really Bland and

4355.32 --> 4360.96
very obviously contains social

4359.0 --> 4365.6
engineering

4360.96 --> 4369.679
formulas then you should pay a tax over

4365.6 --> 4369.679
that for that it's like

4369.92 --> 4376.28
oh oh this is really like all those

4374.199 --> 4378.44
disgusting oh I don't even want to say

4376.28 --> 4380.12
the names there's really disgusting pop

4378.44 --> 4381.879999999999
artists out there that are just

4380.12 --> 4384.679
perverted and

4381.88 --> 4388.2390000000005
like get

4384.679 --> 4389.92
into yeah social engineering tax is like

4388.239 --> 4392.12
oh yeah yeah you're actually

4389.92 --> 4394.4400000000005
manipulating people with your [ __ ]

4392.12 --> 4396.5599999999995
product and spreading it wide you're

4394.44 --> 4398.4
going to have to pay a tax over that

4396.56 --> 4400.1990000000005
yeah because of the detrimental

4398.4 --> 4403.199
influence that you're going to have and

4400.199 --> 4403.96
Society is going to have to like catch

4403.199 --> 4407.159
the

4403.96 --> 4408.84
derangement and deal with it so you have

4407.159 --> 4412.5199999999995
to pay for

4408.84 --> 4412.52
that yeah how about

4418.28 --> 4424.28
that yeah exactly Tommy swab that's

4421.88 --> 4426.08
that's pretty much who I was thinking of

4424.28 --> 4428.4
I didn't want to say the name it's so

4426.08 --> 4432.36
disgusting that guy

4428.4 --> 4436.0
yeah that guy should have like like a

4432.36 --> 4438.679
billion in taxes on social engineer like

4436.0 --> 4441.4
the damage that that [ __ ] person or

4438.679 --> 4444.84
rather his record company or whatever

4441.4 --> 4447.32
has caused with that product should

4444.84 --> 4450.360000000001
massively be

4447.32 --> 4454.5199999999995
taxed like yeah you are a detriment to

4450.36 --> 4454.5199999999995
our society now we pay

does

4494.159 --> 4499.239
they were always right we just couldn't

4496.32 --> 4501.4
handle it we were still too

4499.239 --> 4504.959999999999
indoctrinated and overwhelmed and

Enchanted and in love with this

4508.12 --> 4512.5599999999995
was only ever going to be pure

4513.4 --> 4520.5199999999995
demonic and Muhammad called it what can

4517.0 --> 4522.199
you say he called it bro he called it

4520.52 --> 4525.1990000000005

[Music]

4574.239 --> 4581.759999999999
right but to be clear

4576.6 --> 4585.159000000001
though I think that like a social

4581.76 --> 4588.56
engineering tax on music and movie

4585.159 --> 4592.199
product shouldn't be based on how

4588.56 --> 4596.4400000000005
popular it is right it should be based

4592.199 --> 4598.5599999999995
on a at first psychologist but

4596.44 --> 4602.28
eventually like an algorithm that can

4598.56 --> 4604.96
just judge the product like how much is

4602.28 --> 4608.719
this influencing

4604.96 --> 4611.6
everything like manipulating it so that

4608.719 --> 4613.84
it can be like standardized judged like

4611.6 --> 4615.639
you can have like this amount of

4613.84 --> 4619.6
percentage of social engine and that

4615.639 --> 4622.28
would directly equate to how much tax it

4619.6 --> 4627.2390000000005
is right so that you could literally

4622.28 --> 4632.639
like oh a product is here okay unleash

4627.239 --> 4632.638999999999
algorithm ah this is like

4633.6 --> 4639.639
12.7% which is

4636.48 --> 4642.32
average like if it would be around 25%

4639.639 --> 4646.639
it would get serious and then it's like

4642.32 --> 4646.639
yeah this well okay 12 and a

4648.6 --> 4653.159000000001
12.7% how does that correlate with the

4651.639 --> 4655.76
the how much it should be taxed I don't

4653.159 --> 4658.04
know how much that is I mean not 12%

4655.76 --> 4660.280000000001
that's if you're just going to like tax

4658.04 --> 4662.5199999999995
things as a standard on 12% like

4660.28 --> 4665.5599999999995
everything's just going to die right

4662.52 --> 4668.719
it's not meant to just kill it all it's

4665.56 --> 4670.76
just meant to discard the [ __ ] social

4668.719 --> 4675.52

[Music]

4694.199 --> 4701.599999999999
be wow you still cranky steamy

4698.52 --> 4703.639
traveler cuz what about damages for loud

4701.6 --> 4706.639
R when is not [ __ ]

4703.639 --> 4706.639
funny

4707.52 --> 4714.040000000001
yeah yeah what I do here is not being

4710.96 --> 4715.88
played on loudspeaker in public as far

4714.04 --> 4719.0
as I know if people are doing that

4715.88 --> 4723.159000000001
you're a [ __ ] nuts I don't give you

4719.0 --> 4726.6
permission to play my show out loud in

4723.159 --> 4729.12
public if you do that I can't stop you I

4726.6 --> 4731.6
can't be held responsible for people

4729.12 --> 4731.599999999999
doing

4731.92 --> 4734.92
that

4735.44 --> 4745.799999999999
yeah my show is meant for 12 years and

4741.159 --> 4749.799999999999
older so that means not in public

4745.8 --> 4752.92
because there is younger than 12 in

4749.8 --> 4754.84
public don't do that I don't give you

4752.92 --> 4757.08
permission to do that I give you

4754.84 --> 4759.0
permission to share on social media

4757.08 --> 4763.639
platforms and with other

4759.0 --> 4767.8
people in private my show is not meant

4763.639 --> 4770.719
to play in public I cannot be held

4767.8 --> 4773.159000000001
accountable for what other people do

4770.719 --> 4773.159
with my

4776.57 --> 4781.38
[Music]

4785.44 --> 4791.44
show social engineering could be used

4787.88 --> 4791.4400000000005
for good and completely raise the

4791.719 --> 4797.12
vibe yeah

4793.679 --> 4797.12
yeah sure it

4804.28 --> 4809.84
could right but I mean the risk

4808.199 --> 4812.239
especially of perfected social

4809.84 --> 4814.32
engineering is that you're just going to

4812.239 --> 4817.839999999999
try to mold

4814.32 --> 4819.799999999999
everybody like a piece of plastic like

4817.84 --> 4823.12
oh well we'll just social engineer all

4819.8 --> 4825.12
these positive things in there it's all

4823.12 --> 4827.44
manipulation it's about that it's

4825.12 --> 4831.8
manipulation that's the problem it's not

4827.44 --> 4834.0
about oh good manipulation versus bad no

4831.8 --> 4837.1990000000005
manipulation just the

4834.0 --> 4839.679
manipulation yeah oh it's a good manipul

4837.199 --> 4841.44
oh yeah what about if it's another era

4839.679 --> 4844.719
then suddenly that manipulation is

4841.44 --> 4848.32
really bad for the mindset of then it's

4844.719 --> 4850.639
like no manipulation is bad social

4848.32 --> 4853.08
engineering is manipulation if that's

4850.639 --> 4855.76
public it should be made aware of off

4853.08 --> 4855.76
and it should be

4856.32 --> 4861.88
taxed in major media

4869.04 --> 4875.44
Productions yeah otherwise if something

4871.92 --> 4876.84
is super popular then there yeah what

4875.44 --> 4880.5599999999995
you're not going to text it because it's

4876.84 --> 4883.04
super popular I'll bet you like infinite

4880.56 --> 4884.96
amount of money that those super popular

4883.04 --> 4888.239
product are like more socially

4884.96 --> 4891.44
engineered than anything else

4888.239 --> 4894.199
yeah popularity is not going to be the

4891.44 --> 4898.199
Arbiter on whether something gets taxed

4894.199 --> 4901.5599999999995
for being social engineering or not

4898.199 --> 4905.5599999999995
yeah that's the point it's not about oh

4901.56 --> 4907.6
we don't want unpopular things oh so you

4905.56 --> 4909.2390000000005
want to be part of the hive Collective

4907.6 --> 4911.1990000000005
drone of

4909.239 --> 4916.759999999999
indoctrination because they have the

4911.199 --> 4922.04
good indoctrination yes no no

4916.76 --> 4922.04
indoctrination at all away with

4923.6 --> 4932.120000000001
it that's my point that's my stance on

4926.56 --> 4932.120000000001
this just stop stop the [ __ ]

4932.639 --> 4937.96
manipulation Yeah the more you just

4935.32 --> 4940.599999999999
force social engineering manipulation on

4937.96 --> 4944.56
people the more they will start to

4940.6 --> 4944.56
become like drones

4944.96 --> 4951.28
and be manipulatable like drones and be

4948.56 --> 4953.679
abusable like drones and it will just

4951.28 --> 4956.96
make things work will have a suction

4953.679 --> 4959.84
sound a suction effect from controlling

4956.96 --> 4963.159
Elites the more numpties that are just

4959.84 --> 4966.4400000000005
manipulatable like a bunch of dolls out

4963.159 --> 4968.799999999999
there the more those people arrive

4966.44 --> 4972.879999999999
because of social engineering the more

4968.8 --> 4975.8
predatory these social Engineers will be

4972.88 --> 4978.1990000000005
the mo the more dark they will try

4975.8 --> 4982.360000000001
things the more dark it will

4978.199 --> 4984.4
become you have to stop it there is no

4982.36 --> 4987.44
good social

4984.4 --> 4991.759999999999
engineering that like a durable like you

4987.44 --> 4995.678999999999
can give a n in something in a

4991.76 --> 4998.12
moment but you can't just like rely on

4995.679 --> 5000.76
manipulation

4998.12 --> 5003.0
continually and have Society be

5000.76 --> 5008.08
continually manipulated

5003.0 --> 5008.08
has to stop it just creates more

5022.78 --> 5026.8

5182.52 --> 5186.679
long what it definitely feels like

5186.96 --> 5197.44
it you feel like a total sjw right now

5191.199 --> 5197.44
and you know you know why don't don't

5202.96 --> 5209.28
play yeah you're still triggered from

5205.719 --> 5211.199
yesterday I know what that's like I

5209.28 --> 5214.199
recognize the

5211.199 --> 5214.199

5215.199 --> 5223.28
yeah everything I said in the in Skype

5218.32 --> 5226.199
yesterday to you I meant yeah you didn't

5223.28 --> 5228.599999999999
listen I meant it though I'm kind of

5226.199 --> 5228.599999999999
sick of

5230.76 --> 5238.1990000000005
it I'm not going to be manipulated by

anyone under any circumstances for

5238.199 --> 5240.678999999999
whatever

5240.84 --> 5246.28
reason as especially if there's some

5244.36 --> 5248.08
ideology behind

5246.28 --> 5252.08
it

5248.08 --> 5255.32
never I will go over every line

5252.08 --> 5256.92
especially because of that yeah it's

5255.32 --> 5259.92
what I

5256.92 --> 5263.56
do and I will keep doing it and I will

5259.92 --> 5266.08
keep moving the line that I go over do

5263.56 --> 5269.639
you understand that is what I do it's

5266.08 --> 5272.5599999999995
what I will keep doing I swear I will

5269.639 --> 5274.88
keep doing it and there's nothing

5272.56 --> 5279.320000000001
anybody is going to do about it

5274.88 --> 5279.32
including you do you

5282.36 --> 5288.28
understand does that include subliminal

5285.28 --> 5288.28

[Music]

5325.66 --> 5328.8589999999995
[Music]

5330.88 --> 5335.88

5332.639 --> 5335.88
messages would also

5336.92 --> 5342.4400000000005
be part of the reparations social

5339.6 --> 5345.56
engineering system like a lot of things

5342.44 --> 5349.48
would be judged through that in a way

5345.56 --> 5352.52
it's almost like comparable to a carbon

5349.48 --> 5355.638999999999
tax system except it's not completely

not the same

5612.92 --> 5618.119
thing you can be sensitive and not be

5618.8 --> 5624.159000000001
weak

yeah that's what I strive

5624.159 --> 5628.96
for you don't seem to be striving for

6036.56 --> 6042.080000000001
rough but on point but yeah if you just

6040.0 --> 6045.96
scroll in in the middle of that then you

6042.08 --> 6049.8
have no idea what the hell is going

6045.96 --> 6052.92
on that is fair enough Joe Biden is

6049.8 --> 6052.92

6068.599 --> 6075.52

6071.28 --> 6079.36
this article where did I find that I

6075.52 --> 6079.360000000001
think what is on X or

6079.84 --> 6084.599
on

6081.719 --> 6084.599
where did I find

6085.76 --> 6091.639
it was

6088.76 --> 6094.2390000000005
it where basically I think it was like

6091.639 --> 6098.28
infow Wars or

6094.239 --> 6100.839999999999
something was so weird like it today

6098.28 --> 6103.92
let's see if it's still

6100.84 --> 6106.04
there where Putin had basically declared

6103.92 --> 6109.4400000000005
like he would prefer

6106.04 --> 6109.44
Biden over

6109.84 --> 6112.84
Trump

6114.36 --> 6119.239
like you would have to wonder like if he

6117.88 --> 6122.36
watched

6119.239 --> 6124.48
Owen or if he's just like n but it's

6122.36 --> 6127.199
very logical what's going on it's like

6124.48 --> 6129.919999999999

6371.44 --> 6377.5599999999995
racism

6372.599 --> 6380.84
racism that's just weak weak

6377.56 --> 6385.76
weak yeah you don't learn any anything

6380.84 --> 6385.76
that way you're just weak just

6387.82 --> 6404.648999999999
[Music]

6408.8 --> 6413.8
scared yeah probably has bike theft has

6412.08 --> 6417.119
gone down because suddenly everybody

6413.8 --> 6417.119000000001
becomes really aware of

6418.56 --> 6422.4400000000005
it it it is a

6426.52 --> 6433.599
thing I mean now it's like them black

6430.719 --> 6435.2390000000005
kids out there like they're going to

6433.599 --> 6437.1990000000005
every time they think like oh just going

6435.239 --> 6441.0
to steal this or bike or whatever for

6437.199 --> 6443.678999999999
the fun of it they now know like oh

6441.0 --> 6446.48
but if somebody actually gets me caught

6443.679 --> 6449.1990000000005
on camera then like that thing is going

6446.48 --> 6451.718999999999
to go viral and I'm going to be probably

6449.199 --> 6453.44
used as an example in Owen Benjamin's

6451.719 --> 6458.28
live

6453.44 --> 6461.5199999999995
stream yeah it's provably a

6458.28 --> 6461.5199999999995
repellent like

6462.4 --> 6467.759999999999
provably like that's called peer

6464.76 --> 6470.56
pressure through

6467.76 --> 6472.719
exposure like hey you do this well well

6470.56 --> 6475.119000000001
we're going to then make fun of you and

6472.719 --> 6478.4
parade you

6475.119 --> 6478.4
around with

6478.48 --> 6483.04
this

6479.81 --> 6486.320000000001
[Music]

6483.04 --> 6490.28
brilliant yeah

6486.32 --> 6490.28
that indeed slowmo moon

6490.56 --> 6497.400000000001
buggy but I mean it's it's a work in

6493.48 --> 6500.32
progress right this is all about just

6497.4 --> 6502.759999999999
the acceptance of it like yes there are

6500.32 --> 6506.199
differences hey

6502.76 --> 6510.96
those when the people get

6506.199 --> 6513.5199999999995
trashy they get trashy in different

6510.96 --> 6515.2390000000005
ways different types of things come

6513.52 --> 6519.040000000001
forward per

6515.239 --> 6521.36
group and to like just accept it like

6519.04 --> 6524.36
hey that's the thing it's okay you don't

6521.36 --> 6527.159
have to be afraid you don't have to be

6524.36 --> 6531.759999999999
angry over it just know what is

6527.159 --> 6534.96
what know what happens be able to size

6531.76 --> 6535.96
up what will happen better by knowing

6534.96 --> 6540.36
what's

6535.96 --> 6540.36
what there's nothing bad about

6541.56 --> 6544.979
[Music]

6545.239 --> 6552.839999999999
it but it is a work in progress I mean

6549.04 --> 6554.92
there's a lot of different behaviors out

6552.84 --> 6556.719
there and we're the world's getting

6554.92 --> 6559.88
worse in

6556.719 --> 6562.679
ways and there's a lot to still work

6559.88 --> 6564.679
through with this stuff so I can't even

6562.679 --> 6567.04
fully predict like where own Benjamin is

6564.679 --> 6569.639
going to go with it where this whole

6567.04 --> 6571.88
thing is going to move in towards I

6569.639 --> 6571.88
don't

6572.639 --> 6576.719
know but I'm curious to find

6578.119 --> 6583.08
out can you imagine how fun YouTube

6580.719 --> 6584.32
would be if you could just say whatever

6583.08 --> 6588.0
you

6584.32 --> 6591.5599999999995
want I don't know duper I think that you

6588.0 --> 6595.76
can already pretty much say whatever you

6591.56 --> 6599.92
want I can pretty much say whatever I

6595.76 --> 6602.639
want it's just that there's a political

6599.92 --> 6605.32
influence you see it's not about being

6602.639 --> 6610.4800000000005
able to say whatever you want it's about

6605.32 --> 6610.48
are you opposing their

6610.56 --> 6616.92
politics it's all political all the

6613.4 --> 6620.159
censorship is all political it like it

6616.92 --> 6623.28
doesn't matter what you say or if you

6620.159 --> 6625.799999999999
used the words it only matters if it is

6623.28 --> 6629.199
political in opposition to what they

6625.8 --> 6631.719
have what they want and then they'll get

6629.199 --> 6634.879999999999
in your way you

6631.719 --> 6637.119
see they don't give a [ __ ] what you say

6634.88 --> 6640.88
on YouTube they really

6637.119 --> 6644.079
don't trolls will care or whatever and

6640.88 --> 6646.4400000000005
whine about it but YouTube itself it's

6644.079 --> 6647.84
it's too big it's fully automated they

6646.44 --> 6651.159
don't

6647.84 --> 6653.4400000000005
care it's only like are they a political

6651.159 --> 6655.0
opponent risk or something and then

6653.44 --> 6656.96
they'll get in your head then they'll

6655.0 --> 6659.84
get like oh you can't say this you can't

6656.96 --> 6662.199
say that oh we had to complain because

6659.84 --> 6664.079
you're in a political opponent now

6662.199 --> 6666.919999999999
that's how they see you then that's why

6664.079 --> 6669.32
they censor you it's nothing to do with

6666.92 --> 6673.079
what you're talking about I've said all

6669.32 --> 6676.4
kinds of things all over my channel and

6673.079 --> 6676.4
nobody gives a

6678.56 --> 6681.96
[ __ ] liter

6683.44 --> 6689.32
people are outraged and nothing happens

6686.719 --> 6693.4800000000005
like they don't

6689.32 --> 6698.04
care it doesn't matter because I'm not a

6693.48 --> 6698.04
political threat to

6698.28 --> 6703.5199999999995
YouTube that's a fact I know that is the

6701.56 --> 6705.599
case I know that's why this is all

6703.52 --> 6708.56
happening the way it is Owen Benjamin is

6705.599 --> 6711.0
an enormous political threat to them CU

6708.56 --> 6714.079000000001
he's like much big

6711.0 --> 6716.32
and he will like confront them

6714.079 --> 6718.92
individually I don't really do that I

6716.32 --> 6720.679
don't really address individuals like at

6718.92 --> 6723.32
the top or anything I like leave the

6720.679 --> 6725.32
shitty alone like leave them among the

6723.32 --> 6728.44
turrets floating upwards I'm like I'm

6725.32 --> 6729.759999999999
not I don't give a [ __ ] like they will

6728.44 --> 6733.119
meet their

6729.76 --> 6738.0
end I don't even want to point at them

6733.119 --> 6738.0
really or as as little as I

6738.119 --> 6742.92
can like what's the point

6740.719 --> 6747.4800000000005
continually whining about Bill Gates or

6742.92 --> 6749.18
something right like why why what the

6747.48 --> 6751.678999999999
[ __ ] is the point of

6749.18 --> 6754.280000000001
[Music]

6751.679 --> 6757.679
that like everybody already is

6754.28 --> 6760.239
completely saturated with an

6757.679 --> 6761.84
ass right the only way I even like to

6760.239 --> 6765.44
hear anything about Bill Gates is

6761.84 --> 6768.84
through silly videos

6765.44 --> 6771.759999999999
like Bill and

6768.84 --> 6774.0
Bezos in like skits from Quantum of

6771.76 --> 6775.679
conscience that's the F that I like that

6774.0 --> 6777.04
to listen to that that's funny that's

6775.679 --> 6780.4
kind of

6777.04 --> 6782.84
interesting but all this like yeah we

6780.4 --> 6785.28
know we know I've known for quite a

6782.84 --> 6788.360000000001
while like my entire lifetime since I

6785.28 --> 6793.759999999999
first heard Bill Gates he's a [ __ ]

6788.36 --> 6796.159
demon I know I knew that since I was

6793.76 --> 6798.04
10 I know yeah that's like one of the

6796.159 --> 6800.32
most evil guys in the

6798.04 --> 6802.88
world he ruined everything

6800.32 --> 6805.119
everything he touches like goes to [ __ ]

6802.88 --> 6809.2390000000005
everything he touches every business he

6805.119 --> 6811.44
gets into gets destroyed and polluted

6809.239 --> 6811.44
and

6811.719 --> 6819.88
ruined everything but I mean what's the

6817.32 --> 6824.119
point just going to whine about him all

6819.88 --> 6824.119
day long and then

6825.76 --> 6831.280000000001
what is it going to stop you know how

6829.199 --> 6834.879999999999
many people people whine nonstop about

6831.28 --> 6838.239
Bill Gates how is that helping is it

6834.88 --> 6841.599
actually working or has Bill Gates now

6838.239 --> 6844.598999999999
more power than he ever has arguably

6841.599 --> 6847.079
than any P other person in the

6844.599 --> 6850.04
world like is it

6847.079 --> 6853.239
helping no it's not

6850.04 --> 6856.599
helping there's no

6853.239 --> 6859.119
point and I get that and I'm not a

6856.599 --> 6861.679
threat not even to YouTube like they

6859.119 --> 6861.679
don't care

6862.52 --> 6867.320000000001
they make risky jokes about Jews and

6864.84 --> 6869.04
everything and like they don't mind they

6867.32 --> 6871.44
don't really care they know I'm not

6869.04 --> 6871.44
really a

6874.04 --> 6881.199
threat because politically like I'm not

6878.599 --> 6883.360000000001
one of those

6881.199 --> 6887.36
people I'm a

6883.36 --> 6889.799999999999
weird on my own guy and I just happen to

6887.36 --> 6892.719
get into arguments with literally

6889.8 --> 6892.719
everyone

6894.599 --> 6899.679
ever I mean it's very rare to find

6897.36 --> 6902.96
anybody here on the internet that knows

6899.679 --> 6905.1990000000005
me has communicated me that they hadn't

6902.96 --> 6906.88
at some point gotten into some kind of

6905.199 --> 6910.44
argument with

6906.88 --> 6910.4400000000005
me it's kind of

6912.28 --> 6918.84
rare and I'm sure there's people trying

6915.32 --> 6921.079
to report me all over the place on a

6918.84 --> 6923.599
daily basis I mean if if they try to

6921.079 --> 6926.04
report my shows as much as I get spam

6923.599 --> 6928.679
hate mails from the same guys every

6926.04 --> 6931.44
freaking day then it's continual and

6928.679 --> 6934.4
like YouTube is just like

6931.44 --> 6937.079
wow we're just going to leave him alone

6934.4 --> 6937.879999999999
like they get tired of trying to check

6937.079 --> 6941.599
the

6937.88 --> 6944.56
trolls complaints they get tired of

6941.599 --> 6946.599
it because every time somebody has to

6944.56 --> 6948.599
then actually like watch this stuff the

6946.599 --> 6950.32
algorithms are going to really pick it

6948.599 --> 6952.719
up

6950.32 --> 6955.639
right that just have and then somebody

6952.719 --> 6958.159
has to actually watch it and then they

6955.639 --> 6959.119
get influenced in a way that they can't

6958.159 --> 6962.04
really

6959.119 --> 6964.5599999999995
handle so it's like all these trolls

6962.04 --> 6967.28
trying to report me basically forces

6964.56 --> 6969.92
people that work for YouTube to

6967.28 --> 6974.28
accidentally wake up by what I talk

6969.92 --> 6977.52
about and how I do that and like they're

6974.28 --> 6980.079
probably just like not even looking at

6977.52 --> 6983.639
the reports anymore because like they're

6980.079 --> 6986.0
done trying to see if it actually is

6983.639 --> 6986.0
about

6986.76 --> 6992.4800000000005
anything yeah like police when people

6989.88 --> 6995.4400000000005
false report exactly they're like

6992.48 --> 6997.638999999999
they're not checking it

6995.44 --> 7000.719
anymore like they know like this guy

6997.639 --> 7003.76
gets continual trolling [ __ ] and they're

7000.719 --> 7005.8
like yeah okay he did something bad yeah

7003.76 --> 7007.719
we hear that more often no he hasn't

7005.8 --> 7011.4800000000005
done anything

7007.719 --> 7011.4800000000005
illegal right

7014.079 --> 7019.679
and I mean it's kind of nuts you know

7016.56 --> 7023.599
like I'm this guy in the

7019.679 --> 7024.599
Netherlands for all places with less

7023.599 --> 7027.159000000001
than

7024.599 --> 7030.119000000001
3,000

7027.159 --> 7034.4
subscribers and I'm probably like one of

7030.119 --> 7038.04
the more hated people on YouTube there

7034.4 --> 7040.04
so many people just like go around even

7038.04 --> 7042.96
Beyond YouTube Just

7040.04 --> 7047.32
nagging about me

7042.96 --> 7049.679
NeverEnding nagging nagging oh oh AR is

7047.32 --> 7053.0
so gay oh this and that oh you're so

7049.679 --> 7057.52
evil oh you're a Nazi oh you're racist

7053.0 --> 7059.84
or what dude I don't I've run out

7057.52 --> 7064.52
of I don't even know what the hell they

7059.84 --> 7068.28
all call me I'm crazy I'm insane

7064.52 --> 7070.92
I'm I'm secretly Rich or I'm just super

7068.28 --> 7075.119
poor like the trolls can't even make up

7070.92 --> 7075.119
their minds about what I'm supposed to

7075.32 --> 7081.5199999999995
be and that expresses itself in like

7078.599 --> 7083.400000000001
those them in chat saying like ha Arn

7081.52 --> 7086.0
where did you get a damn job where did

7083.4 --> 7088.119
you work for a living Arwin and then I'm

7086.0 --> 7089.199
like yeah well why don't you just give

7088.119 --> 7093.079
me the

7089.199 --> 7094.839999999999
job then yeah because it's not going to

7093.079 --> 7097.84
work trying to look for it it's like

7094.84 --> 7100.4400000000005
yeah yeah they do check internet history

7097.84 --> 7102.4400000000005
like yeah yeah that's my [ __ ] point

7100.44 --> 7103.7
yeah so why don't you stop complaining

7102.44 --> 7106.199
and just give it to me

7103.7 --> 7109.119
[Music]

7106.199 --> 7110.919999999999
then yeah they don't get it they don't

7109.119 --> 7113.96
even understand what they're trolling me

7110.92 --> 7119.119
with they don't know they're

7113.96 --> 7119.119
just I have to whine and complain about

7119.679 --> 7125.36
something that's what I

7122.079 --> 7127.799999999999
get they just go nuts and they don't

7125.36 --> 7131.32
even know what they're complaining about

7127.8 --> 7131.320000000001
anymore they're just

7146.07 --> 7149.7699999999995
[Music]

7150.719 --> 7157.28
complaining criticism is self criticism

7154.119 --> 7157.28
yes I

7158.04 --> 7163.159
agree and like it logically works like

7161.0 --> 7166.92
that every time you accuse somebody you

7163.159 --> 7166.92
accuse that part in you as

7168.0 --> 7173.239
well and

7169.88 --> 7174.88
that's why you have to fix it or you're

7173.239 --> 7177.598999999999
complaining about the thing that you

7174.88 --> 7180.76
don't fix about yourself is going to

7177.599 --> 7180.76
physically start hurting

7182.0 --> 7188.52
you like if you complain about other

7185.639 --> 7189.84

7188.52 --> 7193.159000000001
that

7189.84 --> 7196.400000000001
under control or you won't be able to

7193.159 --> 7199.598999999999
continue pointing it out in others

7196.4 --> 7202.28
without hurting

7199.599 --> 7207.1990000000005
yourself because you're

7202.28 --> 7209.639
suppressing that you do it for your own

7207.199 --> 7212.4
conscious the trolls are jealous of my

7209.639 --> 7214.56

7923.679 --> 7931.88
done let Aron take us let the robotic

7928.199 --> 7934.44
automated pilot take us so we can forget

7931.88 --> 7938.119

7934.44 --> 7939.36
Consciousness and all of that just let

7938.119 --> 7943.92

7949.92 --> 7956.52
doing you haven't got threatening emails

7952.48 --> 7956.5199999999995
yet okay good good for

7958.46 --> 7964.4
[Music]

7960.599 --> 7967.04
you what am we chatting about H Gavin B

7964.4 --> 7971.32
well we're talking about all kinds of

7967.04 --> 7974.079
things trolls it seems and my channel

7971.32 --> 7976.5199999999995
and like what's going on here and and

7974.079 --> 7979.199
earlier we talked

7976.52 --> 7983.84
about there might like what if there was

7979.199 --> 7987.239
like a social engineering tax on media

7983.84 --> 7989.88
products like Disney should be

7987.239 --> 7993.239
taxed for social

7989.88 --> 7996.0
engineering bigger music companies

7993.239 --> 7999.959999999999
record companies should be taxed for

7996.0 --> 7999.96
their social engineering

8000.76 --> 8006.679
it was an idea and I just roll it out

8003.92 --> 8010.2390000000005
yeah social engineering tax like how is

8006.679 --> 8012.04
your product influencing culture and and

8010.239 --> 8016.839999999999
that social engineering tax should

8012.04 --> 8020.159
absolutely not be Democratic in any way

8016.84 --> 8022.119000000001
because Democratic or populist right

8020.159 --> 8024.199
because if you're going to Bas on that

8022.119 --> 8027.0
is like oh but we like this yeah guess

8024.199 --> 8031.28
what demons really like demons really

8027.0 --> 8033.04
like their demon [ __ ] yeah so it should

8031.28 --> 8035.759999999999
never be based on whether something's

8033.04 --> 8039.079
popular or not just like

8035.76 --> 8041.0
subjectively how is it what is the

8039.079 --> 8043.5199999999995
message how is it influencing what is it

8041.0 --> 8043.52
staring

8043.599 --> 8050.1990000000005
at a social engineering text that's just

8047.8 --> 8053.599
based

8050.199 --> 8053.598999999999
off pure

8054.48 --> 8059.879999999999
analysis it was just an idea I had

8062.76 --> 8068.320000000001
you don't really check your emails very

8064.599 --> 8068.32
much okay fair

8069.44 --> 8074.719
enough maybe the people who do not like

8072.239 --> 8078.04
it can maybe not consume it well the

8074.719 --> 8080.28
point is is that there's a me plenty of

8078.04 --> 8084.48
opportunities or situations out there

8080.28 --> 8084.48
gav be where people don't have the

8084.96 --> 8091.719
choice at work for for

8089.4 --> 8095.36
example

8091.719 --> 8098.559
or I don't know at

8095.36 --> 8100.96
some party or whatever it's like but

8098.559 --> 8105.679
especially at work like people don't

8100.96 --> 8105.679
have control over what's on

8106.119 --> 8111.04
yeah you're going to work somewhere the

8108.92 --> 8113.96
boss lik shitty music you're going to be

8111.04 --> 8116.719
listening to shitty

8113.96 --> 8120.4
music oh they want to listen to the

8116.719 --> 8123.32
radio with a bunch of whiny social

8120.4 --> 8125.5199999999995
engineering wankers that are all proped

8123.32 --> 8127.719
and everything like yeah what are you

8125.52 --> 8129.599
going to do complain about it you're

8127.719 --> 8131.88
probably going to lose your job right so

8129.599 --> 8133.04
it's like there's [ __ ] music out there

8131.88 --> 8134.8
and there's a whole bunch of people that

8133.04 --> 8137.48
just can't do anything about it you

8134.8 --> 8139.1990000000005
can't just turn it off because you don't

8137.48 --> 8142.678999999999
have control over

8139.199 --> 8145.598999999999
it yeah you can't turn off the shitty

8142.679 --> 8149.2390000000005
music that plays in a shopping

8145.599 --> 8152.400000000001
mall yeah it's just plays you have to

8149.239 --> 8152.4
listen to it or go

8152.639 --> 8158.079
away it sucks it influences

8155.92 --> 8161.639
everything and that's what they're

8158.079 --> 8164.639
counting on those Mega corporations and

8161.639 --> 8168.76
their musical labels they are counting

8164.639 --> 8170.8
on that they thrive on social

8168.76 --> 8172.76
engineering manipulation especially in

8170.8 --> 8175.559
things like shopping malls where nobody

8172.76 --> 8178.159000000001
has control over the music it just plays

8175.559 --> 8180.159000000001
so they can just undebated do they're

8178.159 --> 8184.119
influencing nobody can do anything about

8180.159 --> 8186.199
it yeah it should be taxed not by the

8184.119 --> 8188.598999999999
people playing the music but by the

8186.199 --> 8193.039999999999
people making that

8188.599 --> 8195.599
music and producing it you have a shitty

8193.04 --> 8197.160000000002
social engineering product well you pay

8195.599 --> 8200.84
your tax for that because it's going to

8197.16 --> 8206.039999999999
do damage to people on the long run and

8200.84 --> 8206.04
you should pay for that damage ahead of

8206.679 --> 8213.219000000001
time

8207.92 --> 8213.219000000001
[Music]

8214.639 --> 8218.598999999998
yeah Chris

8220.08 --> 8225.639
yeah I mean I I could think of worse

8223.08 --> 8230.0
songs than the Mariah car's Christmas

8225.639 --> 8234.92
song right but my point is is

8230.0 --> 8238.719
that our entire lives music has gone

8234.92 --> 8240.479
become more dumb and more man Ula look

8238.719 --> 8243.438999999998
at at the youth look at what they're

8240.479 --> 8246.479
listening to compare this to rebellious

8243.439 --> 8248.76
music from the 60s or 80s or anything

8246.479 --> 8253.199999999999
like what that's now

8248.76 --> 8256.880000000001
that's like this is deranged [ __ ] [ __ ]

8253.2 --> 8259.559000000001
it's not fun music it's really

8256.88 --> 8262.358999999999
unbearable and they're pushing the bar

8259.559 --> 8265.599
they're push it's like no you were just

8262.359 --> 8268.479000000001
saying that about your parents music

8265.599 --> 8272.92
they were telling you like all the you

8268.479 --> 8277.039999999999
no it has palpably provably measurably

8272.92 --> 8279.639
become way worse way worse than it ever

8277.04 --> 8282.92
was and it's going to keep getting worse

8279.639 --> 8282.92
you got to put a halt to

8284.559 --> 8289.559
it

8286.439 --> 8292.04
right before you end up in a world where

8289.559 --> 8294.599
like the music just encourages like

8292.04 --> 8297.04
pre-teens to just publicly masturbate

8294.599 --> 8299.16
and [ __ ] like do it in public where

8297.04 --> 8301.04
everybody like streaking like with

8299.16 --> 8302.88
little kids like oh what you think

8301.04 --> 8307.439
that's outrageous

8302.88 --> 8310.679
well yeah it's only matter of time

8307.439 --> 8313.319
yeah like as far as you can imagine it

8310.679 --> 8316.12
to the point where it's like public

8313.319 --> 8318.439
suicide like in public little children

8316.12 --> 8321.240000000002
killing themselves in public oh it's all

8318.439 --> 8324.16
So Glorious yeah I mean I called it like

8321.24 --> 8328.639
five years ago it's there is no limit to

8324.16 --> 8331.16
how sick this can become no limit

8328.639 --> 8335.839999999998
No Limit if you don't put a Hal to

8331.16 --> 8339.719
it no limit no limit to how horrendous

8335.84 --> 8339.719000000001
it can become No

8340.76 --> 8350.08
Limit yeah or as who said it some

8345.76 --> 8352.479
American from a few centuries ago like

8350.08 --> 8354.28
tyrants will be as tyranical as the

8352.479 --> 8356.479
public will put up with and that's

8354.28 --> 8359.16
exactly what we're dealing with there's

8356.479 --> 8363.039999999999
no limit to how

8359.16 --> 8364.319
horrendous that manipulation can become

8363.04 --> 8368.84
there really

8364.319 --> 8371.8
isn't I can imagine unlimited horror and

8368.84 --> 8373.719000000001
I can't imagine people accepting that

8371.8 --> 8376.039999999999
unlimited horror just standing there

8373.719 --> 8379.88
looking at it and saying nothing doing

8376.04 --> 8382.359
nothing about it I can imagine all of

8379.88 --> 8386.438999999998
that

8382.359 --> 8389.439
okay look at how far it's gotten

8386.439 --> 8389.439
already

8390.84 --> 8396.56
swirling synthesizer with some guy

8393.24 --> 8399.96
yelling talk talk talk over

8396.56 --> 8399.96
what that's

8400.359 --> 8404.479000000001
weird that is really weird

8416.359 --> 8419.359
slow-mo

8420.08 --> 8427.2
wait that's actually a thing SL

8423.68 --> 8427.2
what what the

8432.96 --> 8435.96
hell

8437.88 --> 8441.438999999998
what what the

8446.319 --> 8451.76
[ __ ]

8447.88 --> 8451.759999999998
is this a new thing or an old

8453.319 --> 8456.319
thing

8457.359 --> 8464.52
weird it's horrifying okay

8461.04 --> 8467.399000000001
old ah

8464.52 --> 8469.720000000001
right

8467.399 --> 8472.08
weird

8469.72 --> 8473.199999999999
freaky there's been some weird [ __ ] in

8472.08 --> 8476.399
the past

8473.2 --> 8479.240000000002
man but I guess that just our our

8476.399 --> 8481.56
aesthetic mind just completely blots out

8479.24 --> 8484.8
that that happened you know that's the

8481.56 --> 8488.16
good thing about the Mandela effect mind

8484.8 --> 8490.358999999999
is that you only start complaining about

8488.16 --> 8493.24
the things that you thought were better

8490.359 --> 8496.76
than they really turned out to

8493.24 --> 8498.039999999999
be but everybody will forget like oh

8496.76 --> 8500.6
yeah that

8498.04 --> 8503.2
happened like everybody forgot about it

8500.6 --> 8506.04
like until you see it and like ah what

8503.2 --> 8508.399000000001
the [ __ ] is that everybody forgot about

8506.04 --> 8511.479000000001
it that's the same m IC mind that makes

8508.399 --> 8514.479
you completely not remember it not

8511.479 --> 8517.8
remember how horrible it actually was

8514.479 --> 8517.8
it's the same thing in the

8525.85 --> 8529.04
[Music]

8536.16 --> 8539.16
mind

8541.84 --> 8546.56
boss who was smoking all day in the

8543.68 --> 8549.6
office yeah well I'm not against smoking

8546.56 --> 8551.76
in the office but you should have proper

8549.6 --> 8553.6
ventilation so it's like oh boss wants

8551.76 --> 8557.6
to smoke in his

8553.6 --> 8560.319
office I mean not right next to other

8557.6 --> 8562.92
people that shouldn't

8560.319 --> 8565.72
be but I think any boss that wants to

8562.92 --> 8567.76
smoke in their office should get a

8565.72 --> 8569.72
ventilation system specific specifically

8567.76 --> 8573.319
for that in their office so that they

8569.72 --> 8573.319
can just smoke in their office

8575.72 --> 8582.88
absolutely but yeah don't just walk

8580.439 --> 8585.92
around and with your employers

8582.88 --> 8588.92
everywhere and then smoke and and force

8585.92 --> 8590.76
them to smoke your secondhand smoke

8588.92 --> 8592.439
that's not nice that's not good that's

8590.76 --> 8596.08
not

8592.439 --> 8599.08
durable but don't ban smoking

8596.08 --> 8599.08
altogether

8599.12 --> 8602.12
I I am against

8605.56 --> 8612.92
that hypnogogic music all right really

8609.96 --> 8615.679999999998
bad news music yes no look the social

8612.92 --> 8618.56
engineering taxes on the Beatles would

8615.68 --> 8619.960000000001
be off the chart it would be like at 80

8618.56 --> 8622.56
or

8619.96 --> 8625.519999999999
90% basically like

8622.56 --> 8627.56
yeah you can now hand in all those

8625.52 --> 8631.12
profits you made because we're going to

8627.56 --> 8632.64
need it for mental health care in The

8631.12 --> 8636.359
Next

8632.64 --> 8636.358999999999
Century it's pretty

8656.0 --> 8659.0
much

8665.08 --> 8668.72
children hello borders boy I don't know

8666.76 --> 8671.399
that song music for children I have no

8668.72 --> 8671.399
idea what that

8678.359 --> 8685.640000000001
is one time dropped the ring and nobody

8681.24 --> 8685.64
told her what she didn't notice

8685.96 --> 8694.08
huh I always notice things like

8690.8 --> 8697.479
that but Ian it's also because I'm a

8694.08 --> 8700.16
Goldsmith I think I've done that too

8697.479 --> 8703.519999999999
like women dropping earrings or whatever

8700.16 --> 8707.64
and like I'll find it very

8703.52 --> 8707.640000000001
quick because I know how to

8712.84 --> 8718.72
look your ball smoked in your face yeah

8715.359 --> 8721.359
that's annoying like I'm a smoker and I

8718.72 --> 8725.319
would be repulsed by

8721.359 --> 8728.08
that like I'm a smoker I'm not going to

8725.319 --> 8730.319
smoke on the work floor and I definitely

8728.08 --> 8734.039999999999
don't want somebody else to keep blowing

8730.319 --> 8737.119999999999
smoke in my face at my work even though

8734.04 --> 8741.319000000001
I am a smoker I wouldn't want that you

8737.12 --> 8741.319000000001
got to keep it away from other

8741.359 --> 8747.84
people like have a smoking

8744.56 --> 8749.56
room don't like say h no smoking room

8747.84 --> 8751.24
you just have to go outside or you're

8749.56 --> 8754.319
just not allowed to smoke at all like

8751.24 --> 8756.56
that's unreasonable have a smoking room

8754.319 --> 8756.56
why

8759.12 --> 8764.76
not just saying the be music is music

8762.319 --> 8764.76
for is

8769.12 --> 8774.92
it was it intended for children cuz

8772.76 --> 8777.439
that's really messed up it definitely

8774.92 --> 8782.399
shouldn't be intended for children

8777.439 --> 8785.52
it's very teen adolescent

8782.399 --> 8788.479
really I was never thought no that can't

8785.52 --> 8790.560000000001
be right it that's it was NE be was

8788.479 --> 8794.76
never music for children it was always

8790.56 --> 8796.56
for teens and older teens and

8794.76 --> 8799.04
Adolescence I don't know where you're

8796.56 --> 8799.039999999999
getting that

8805.8 --> 8808.8
from

8821.12 --> 8825.479000000001
children's music M

8825.52 --> 8832.24
weird that is strange slowmo I yeah

8829.88 --> 8833.8
maybe it was all just so new that people

8832.24 --> 8835.72
literally didn't know what to think

8833.8 --> 8838.599999999999
about it back

8835.72 --> 8840.438999999998
then you got to realize in the 20th

8838.6 --> 8843.6
century there's been a lot of music

8840.439 --> 8847.16
revolutions like completely new forms

8843.6 --> 8850.04
and everything like all the time like

8847.16 --> 8854.56
even in the first

8850.04 --> 8859.0
half first half like all this early Jazz

8854.56 --> 8859.0
and what it all turn into and

8859.52 --> 8866.399000000001
then and even like interesting late

8863.479 --> 8868.679999999998
classical stuff that barely anybody ever

8866.399 --> 8868.68
heard of

8869.279 --> 8875.76
of and then you yeah man there the music

8872.84 --> 8878.479
there so many music development rock and

8875.76 --> 8882.84
roll was just this whole thing a new

8878.479 --> 8886.64
thing a new Pace never heard of before

8882.84 --> 8888.880000000001
that and like that's now like just

8886.64 --> 8890.76
standard but back then that was like

8888.88 --> 8893.56
never heard of

8890.76 --> 8894.439
ever we can barely imagine now what

8893.56 --> 8897.92
that's

8894.439 --> 8901.279
like we're so used to all of

8897.92 --> 8904.04
like rock and roll is like like a

8901.279 --> 8907.52
rudimentary in music to

8904.04 --> 8911.2
us well at one time not too long ago not

8907.52 --> 8914.6
even a century ago nothing like that

8911.2 --> 8917.76
existed anywhere nobody had ever heard

8914.6 --> 8920.960000000001
of it of something like that yeah and

8917.76 --> 8923.439
now it's rudimentary in our music

8920.96 --> 8925.56
understanding that's how far things have

8923.439 --> 8928.84
developed things have developed farther

8925.56 --> 8931.76
than we can normally keep track of like

8928.84 --> 8935.04
it it's too much it bypasses our

8931.76 --> 8938.64
societal Consciousness we don't realize

8935.04 --> 8938.640000000001
how much of a difference it really

8946.6 --> 8950.76
is have I ever wor

8951.44 --> 8954.62
[Applause]

8955.08 --> 8960.84
bro no d I've never ever worked a day in

8959.8 --> 8964.96
my

8960.84 --> 8964.960000000001
life yeah du of course I've

8969.12 --> 8973.319000000001
worked in the past I've worked

8971.359 --> 8976.12
especially even talked about this

8973.319 --> 8982.359
yesterday I T worked in the

8976.12 --> 8982.359
catering like canteen I was a canteen

8982.399 --> 8989.88
guy serving you your sandwiches and

8985.76 --> 8994.359
meatballs and salad and all

8989.88 --> 8999.319
that at the office that's what I did

8994.359 --> 9001.92
work in a lot like in my late teens and

8999.319 --> 9004.359
20s it's the majority of the types of

9001.92 --> 9007.0
jobs I had I had some moving jobs I had

9004.359 --> 9012.08
some Administration jobs I

9007.0 --> 9015.319
had uh printing in a printing

9012.08 --> 9019.039999999999
company that I remember

9015.319 --> 9021.68
as yeah little things oh it's never I've

9019.04 --> 9026.0
never had like a actual year

9021.68 --> 9028.52
contract like ever which is kind of

9026.0 --> 9033.439
saddening really when I think about it I

9028.52 --> 9036.04
just it never happened it's never

9033.439 --> 9040.08
happened it's not because I didn't try

9036.04 --> 9045.319000000001
it's just I nobody ever gave me a year

9040.08 --> 9045.319
contract it's never happened in my

9045.439 --> 9048.439
life

9051.16 --> 9054.8
and not because I didn't want to just it

9053.96 --> 9059.319
never

9054.8 --> 9059.319
happen I asked for it I never got

9061.76 --> 9068.08
it because I'm not good enough I'm just

9065.64 --> 9071.439
not good enough I'm not a robot who's

9068.08 --> 9074.2
always perfectly on time never asks

9071.439 --> 9076.6
questions can handle whatever

9074.2 --> 9078.6
psychological abuse that just happened

9076.6 --> 9081.68
to spout out out of

9078.6 --> 9084.24
nothing I can't handle it and just act

9081.68 --> 9086.64
like nothing happened yeah and because

9084.24 --> 9089.319
of the combination of all that yeah

9086.64 --> 9091.68
nobody really thinks of me as like a

9089.319 --> 9092.72
durable worker that you would give a

9091.68 --> 9096.279
year

9092.72 --> 9096.278999999999
contract so that's

9096.84 --> 9103.439

9225.16 --> 9228.16
banned

9229.2 --> 9237.240000000002
yeah see that's how far they'll take

9232.72 --> 9241.358999999999
it giving out false hope just be nasty

9237.24 --> 9241.359
they'll do it they'll just do

9244.12 --> 9248.76
it right because we were getting too

9246.52 --> 9251.24
comfortable we're having a comfortable

9248.76 --> 9255.08
conversation despite everything

9251.24 --> 9258.08
and all they can feel is

9255.08 --> 9258.08
pain

9262.72 --> 9268.679999999998
and they just want us to feel that pain

9265.319 --> 9271.16
so then if they can perceive us feeling

9268.68 --> 9275.68
that pain then they can be distracted

9271.16 --> 9275.68
from their own pain for a

9277.72 --> 9283.16
bit because they're certainly not going

9280.399 --> 9285.56
to just make it go away you're not going

9283.16 --> 9287.399
to do anything about it you're just

9285.56 --> 9290.278999999999
going to let it it

9287.399 --> 9292.358999999999
faster inside of

you

9292.359 --> 9301.16
forever and then maybe after your dead

9301.16 --> 9307.119999999999
H yeah that kind of festering that that

9304.72 --> 9310.679999999998
type of festering doesn't go away after

it's like I can't puzzle together how I

10600.88 --> 10606.08

10603.08 --> 10606.08
threat

10608.439 --> 10613.279

10610.68 --> 10616.0
presence persisting out there or even

getting a little bigger how is that like

10616.0 --> 10619.96
really going to change the world

10625.2 --> 10631.04
around I mean I do try I'm always just

10628.16 --> 10631.039999999999
trying

10631.239 --> 10636.0
but I'm just a small time Channel

10637.6 --> 10643.68
I deal in very Niche

10640.56 --> 10645.359
subjects a lot of people won't even

10643.68 --> 10647.84
understand what the hell that is all

10645.359 --> 10652.640000000001
about prime minister yeah that's a good

10647.84 --> 10652.64
one that's hilarious Gavin be but

10655.04 --> 10663.0
no what flat soid my

10660.16 --> 10666.0
God

10663.0 --> 10666.0
no

10666.399 --> 10673.479
no then definitely

10668.56 --> 10675.359
me yeah I mean one thing you got to have

10673.479 --> 10678.039999999999
from a prime minister and that is that

10675.359 --> 10680.960000000001
they have to be audible you have to

10678.04 --> 10683.68
actually understand what they're saying

10680.96 --> 10686.919999999998
yeah so then please by all means pick me

10683.68 --> 10689.92
not flaty for [ __ ]

10686.92 --> 10689.92
sake

10691.84 --> 10697.439
uh going to sound super gay but I think

10695.0 --> 10702.319
they don't like folks who can't see

10697.439 --> 10702.319
through the illusion it's not super

10706.16 --> 10712.279
gay it's just kind of obvious but I mean

10710.12 --> 10716.6
just not liking them how I mean there's

10712.279 --> 10716.6
so many people that are like that

10722.92 --> 10730.6
and I don't see it

10727.2 --> 10730.6
like just

10740.96 --> 10746.919999999998
why okay look not just not

10744.64 --> 10749.84
liking

10746.92 --> 10752.76
folk that have certain ability or

10749.84 --> 10755.12
whatever like how is that going to then

10752.76 --> 10757.880000000001
automatically put in this category I

10755.12 --> 10757.880000000001
don't get that

10758.0 --> 10763.6
part like I'm not effectively a threat

10761.2 --> 10766.84
like what is it I'm doing

10763.6 --> 10769.880000000001
even I never really get involved in

10766.84 --> 10773.479
politics I often have very neutral

10769.88 --> 10773.479
stance whenever something comes

10782.84 --> 10789.64
up

10784.96 --> 10792.919999999998
oh okay gin B yeah sorry about that I

10789.64 --> 10795.68
the ads are unfortunately just a part of

10792.92 --> 10795.68
my channel

10795.72 --> 10800.358999999999
so I'm not overly impressed by the

10798.88 --> 10803.16
quality of the ads that have been

10800.359 --> 10807.279
rolling out recently I can tell you

10803.16 --> 10807.279
that very annoying

10807.72 --> 10813.119999999999
ads maybe I shouldn't have had that show

10810.64 --> 10814.56
about like the like the Mandela effect

10813.12 --> 10816.68
and how they

10814.56 --> 10819.278999999999
agitation

10816.68 --> 10821.92
advertisement I think that since that

10819.279 --> 10825.92
episode like the average quality of my

10821.92 --> 10825.92
ads have become more annoying than

10827.239 --> 10831.6
ever get ads related to what is talked

10829.96 --> 10834.8
about oh

10831.6 --> 10837.52
really okay that's kind of

10834.8 --> 10839.239
interesting at least it's like at least

10837.52 --> 10841.6
it's doing what it's supposed to be

10839.239 --> 10843.76
doing

10841.6 --> 10845.880000000001
then I don't know I just get really

10843.76 --> 10849.08
really annoying

10845.88 --> 10852.519999999999
ads it's all about oh how can

10849.08 --> 10855.92
you do some work that's really [ __ ]

10852.52 --> 10860.84
lame and just they show just

10855.92 --> 10862.72
ugly like drugged up people like that

10860.84 --> 10865.04
guy looks not healthy that guy looks

10862.72 --> 10867.399
like he could die of cancer any second

10865.04 --> 10869.640000000001
or something like how is that supposed

10867.399 --> 10873.0
to be an example of something that I

10869.64 --> 10875.399
aspire to be like that [ __ ] you I don't

10873.0 --> 10877.68
aspire to be a very sickly looking

10875.399 --> 10879.479
person that's supposedly being smart in

10877.68 --> 10882.479000000001
business or something like what the [ __ ]

10879.479 --> 10886.72
is wrong with you like I don't

10882.479 --> 10889.16
understand these ads they feel very

10886.72 --> 10892.0
manipulative because I certainly

10889.16 --> 10894.92
wouldn't want to buy anything of those

10892.0 --> 10899.479
companies after they showed me that crap

10894.92 --> 10902.239
yeah I'd want anything but that so why

10899.479 --> 10905.64
the hell is it even

10902.239 --> 10907.72
there adds on rumble or pure [ __ ] if

10905.64 --> 10909.76
you can even call it ads I mean there's

10907.72 --> 10912.84
not much of an ad there on Rumble it's

10909.76 --> 10914.76
usually just like look at the new show

10912.84 --> 10920.12
that's on the front

10914.76 --> 10922.439
page or like oh something silly it's

10920.12 --> 10926.84
it's not even it's just barely an ad

10922.439 --> 10930.12
it's like it seems like Rumble ads are

10926.84 --> 10932.319
more like they want to be ads but

10930.12 --> 10936.319000000001
they're not really

10932.319 --> 10941.8
ads they're kind of failed

10936.319 --> 10944.519999999999
ads like the cheap knockoff ads that you

10941.8 --> 10946.039999999999
get to see as popups on some websites

10944.52 --> 10947.239
that's the kind of [ __ ] that comes out

10946.04 --> 10953.6
of

10947.239 --> 10953.6
there what I ver ads what really

10961.84 --> 10969.76
okay kep the flush the gold app wow I've

10964.88 --> 10969.759999999998
never seen that one before this is

10970.16 --> 10977.439
weird but yes I mean the ads on Rumble

10973.56 --> 10980.6
have never caught my eye they are like

10977.439 --> 10984.76
repulsive like like oh my God just

10980.6 --> 10987.319
please please just get on with

10984.76 --> 10989.64
it but I mean YouTube ads are also

10987.319 --> 10991.56
pretty terrible sometimes but Rumble is

10989.64 --> 10994.96
just like

10991.56 --> 10997.72
what like I I wouldn't barely even call

10994.96 --> 11000.519999999999
that ads it's just some weird popup

10997.72 --> 11003.239
thing or something it's like like

11000.52 --> 11006.239
nobody's going to click that except by

11003.239 --> 11006.239
accident

11006.76 --> 11010.239
nobody right

11017.479 --> 11021.479
anyway yeah I've gone over three

11021.6 --> 11028.92
hours why Terry gain does not seem to be

11025.399 --> 11032.76
what they are after yeah yeah it does

11028.92 --> 11032.76
indeed feel like that

11040.6 --> 11045.68
joking but you got to realize of that

11043.16 --> 11049.359
logically that makes sense though right

11045.68 --> 11051.479000000001
because if it's mostly just one Mega

11049.359 --> 11053.479000000001
corporation that owns

11051.479 --> 11055.278999999999
everything well then they're not

11053.479 --> 11057.96
interested in more money they're just

11055.279 --> 11061.0
interested in mind control so they will

11057.96 --> 11064.479
have money to waste on products that

11061.0 --> 11066.08
nobody wants but that will manipulate

11064.479 --> 11070.319
those

11066.08 --> 11073.039999999999
people it makes sense actually so those

11070.319 --> 11076.359
types of ads would actually be a sign

11073.04 --> 11076.359
that black rock is in

11079.04 --> 11085.359
control if ads will try to make you

11082.84 --> 11089.0
click their product so that you can buy

11085.359 --> 11092.319
it it's probably more free than if it's

11089.0 --> 11094.84
just some weird ass mind control weird

11092.319 --> 11096.519999999999
thing that you don't even understand

11094.84 --> 11099.64
what the product

11096.52 --> 11102.239
is cuz that's probably just straight out

11099.64 --> 11106.439
Black Rock

11102.239 --> 11106.439
advertisement programming and poisoning

11109.279 --> 11117.560000000001
indeed I REM yeah yes slowo moon

11115.04 --> 11120.84
buggy bro yesterday there was on

11117.56 --> 11124.16
Infowars was the supposed doctor another

11120.84 --> 11127.68
doctor again oh the virus truth dude I

11124.16 --> 11130.88
was like ramming it out in the chat like

11127.68 --> 11134.479000000001
viruses are fake like it was made up in

11130.88 --> 11136.08
a lab like there is no viruses virus are

11134.479 --> 11138.039999999999
fake they're Medical Science Fiction

11136.08 --> 11141.039999999999
they were made up they literally don't

11138.04 --> 11143.76
exist they literally don't exist it's

11141.04 --> 11146.279
all fear-mongering it's all program in

11143.76 --> 11148.399
it's all making you afraid get their

11146.279 --> 11150.720000000001
product what does the product do it

11148.399 --> 11153.92
inserts poison in you that then caus

11150.72 --> 11156.56
those symptoms that a virus never caused

11153.92 --> 11159.359
because viruses literally don't exist

11156.56 --> 11162.359
it's always been that and it just kept

11159.359 --> 11164.6
rolling it and rolling it just raming it

11162.359 --> 11166.92
out viruses are fake viruses are fake

11164.6 --> 11169.880000000001
made up in a lab it doesn't actually

11166.92 --> 11174.52
Medical Science Fiction poison is what

procedure to establish whether there is

11242.439 --> 11247.800000000001
a virus in anything is completely

11263.12 --> 11269.04
show to perpetuate the lies about

viruses even

11269.04 --> 11275.12
existing medical
