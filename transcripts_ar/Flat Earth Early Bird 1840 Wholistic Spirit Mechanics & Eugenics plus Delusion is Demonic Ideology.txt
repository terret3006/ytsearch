91.399 --> 96.6
right so weather

94.64 --> 100.92
today

96.6 --> 100.91999999999999
yeah not so blue skyed

101.399 --> 108.07900000000001
anymore but I mean that's not surprising

104.64 --> 110.43900000000001
because roughly an hour ago when I woke

108.079 --> 114.55999999999999
up I woke up kind of late today that's

110.439 --> 117.19999999999999
why I'm late literally Trails all over

114.56 --> 120.399
the place being left and now it's this

117.2 --> 124.28
hazy Bank up there

120.399 --> 128.44
can still see the moon a little bit

124.28 --> 130.72
but yeah they literally just squared it

128.44 --> 130.72
all

130.76 --> 139.0
full there's still sun coming

133.959 --> 143.04
through but I mean not so much now or

139.0 --> 144.239
less all this Haze up there I wonder how

143.04 --> 146.76
long that's going to hang around if

144.239 --> 149.959
that's going to turn into like clouds or

146.76 --> 152.67999999999998
it will just blow away I don't know I'm

149.959 --> 156.36
not sure like what the wind is up

152.68 --> 158.76000000000002
there there's a bit of wind down here

156.36 --> 158.76000000000002
just a

159.519 --> 167.31900000000002
little you can see

162.599 --> 167.319
the branches dangling back and

167.56 --> 171.28
forth on the mint

173.08 --> 178.15900000000002
plant right lots of people walking

176.599 --> 180.35999999999999
outside by the

178.159 --> 182.879
way right now

180.36 --> 185.64000000000001
so everybody's feeling like taking a

182.879 --> 187.92
walk for some reason all of a sudden

185.64 --> 192.2
right

187.92 --> 195.39999999999998
now two people jogging in View and

192.2 --> 198.599
like a family with kids a solitary guy

195.4 --> 201.84
another solitary guy coming walking past

198.599 --> 204.959
yeah a lot of people are s subtly

201.84 --> 206.4
walking another guy wow what are where

204.959 --> 209.04
are they

206.4 --> 211.68
going why are they going somewhere right

209.04 --> 211.67999999999998
now

212.0 --> 216.239
this is

213.36 --> 218.239
weird usually don't see that many people

216.239 --> 222.68
walk

218.239 --> 226.239
past during this time even on a Saturday

222.68 --> 229.43900000000002
huh hello Richard G first in chat good

226.239 --> 233.879
to see you here we go again good to see

229.439 --> 235.4
you H it is Saturday the 20th

233.879 --> 238.39999999999998
of

235.4 --> 238.4
January

238.68 --> 241.68
2024

243.799 --> 250.87900000000002
temperature is 1°

246.48 --> 253.879
C it says cloudy and

250.879 --> 253.879
sunny

256.72 --> 261.959
okay

258.56 --> 261.959
sure hello

268.4 --> 271.59999999999997
jog oh

272.919 --> 275.75899999999996
a little rare

282.68 --> 288.63
opportunity wherever you

285.53 --> 288.63
[Music]

288.759 --> 297.56
are right so how you guys doing I'm

293.199 --> 300.56
really late I stayed up very late I was

297.56 --> 303.44
just I just had like this energy during

300.56 --> 306.72
the night that I couldn't really

303.44 --> 309.52
shake I don't know what it is but I

306.72 --> 309.52000000000004
stayed up pretty

309.96 --> 316.68
late went to bed like 4:30 or something

314.199 --> 316.68
just

317.08 --> 320.08
whatever

321.44 --> 327.84
uh yeah yesterday show certainly was

328.479 --> 331.479
intense

338.44 --> 342.88
I'm really proud of like the first part

340.4 --> 346.0
until like the trolls started basically

342.88 --> 346.0
pulling rage went

349.16 --> 354.8
out and in the chat still like

352.56 --> 356.84
eventually got about the whole elevation

354.8 --> 361.479
angle to a globe thing and just the

356.84 --> 361.479
globers just won't stop

364.199 --> 369.479
they think they

366.199 --> 372.199
win because of you could do a plum and

369.479 --> 374.15999999999997
then have a theoretical horizontal and

372.199 --> 376.72
it like it doesn't relate to the Earth

374.16 --> 378.56
and oh then we can do it on a globe they

376.72 --> 380.08000000000004
just they're not going to let it go it's

378.56 --> 383.24
fullblown

380.08 --> 383.24
[ __ ] it

387.0 --> 390.599
is but that's the way they're going to

389.12 --> 395.12
be about

390.599 --> 400.4
it cuz they're really really

395.12 --> 400.4
desperate any virtual temporary hang

400.919 --> 410.31899999999996
on right I mean I can play Ballwin so I

404.96 --> 412.15999999999997
get it but yeah I'm not dependent on him

410.319 --> 415.879
not losing his

412.16 --> 418.40000000000003
faith in order not to go insane you see

415.879 --> 421.40000000000003
that's the big

418.4 --> 421.4
difference

421.759 --> 429.16
because when bwin is just proven

425.96 --> 431.19899999999996
wrong he'll just step back and say like

429.16 --> 434.47900000000004
okay okay

431.199 --> 438.0
boss you know better and it's

434.479 --> 440.75899999999996
true because Balwin is aware that he's a

438.0 --> 444.28
baller and that he is kind of like

440.759 --> 447.879
suppressed through an obsession so he

444.28 --> 451.31899999999996
knows what he's that like he knows it's

447.879 --> 451.319
an illusion he just can't stop

452.4 --> 457.67999999999995
loves it too much and that's how Ballwin

454.8 --> 461.16
works like but if it means like oh he

457.68 --> 465.44
can't do that really then he'll just

461.16 --> 468.84000000000003
like oh okay well then it's just a game

465.44 --> 468.84
anyway cuz it

469.44 --> 475.28
is it really is anyway hello duper Boons

472.919 --> 475.28
good to see

478.0 --> 482.84
you that was laid up so also now nothing

481.039 --> 485.44
is getting done hey there's the Flat

482.84 --> 488.479
Earth early bird show it's more like a

485.44 --> 491.71999999999997
flat Earth late bird show today

488.479 --> 495.36
but oh well we'll probably see the

491.72 --> 495.36
sundown at the end of the

497.879 --> 500.879
show

508.24 --> 511.24
Maybe

512.64 --> 518.64
I don't have to like quit early to make

516.76 --> 522.3199999999999
the store or something because a lot of

518.64 --> 524.76
stores are like closing at

522.32 --> 528.12
5:00 and then on Sunday they are not

524.76 --> 530.64
open at all but I there's nothing that I

528.12 --> 533.8
need that I can't get in

530.64 --> 536.3199999999999
the organic grocery store and that one

533.8 --> 536.3199999999999
is just

536.959 --> 545.76
open till what is it at

541.24 --> 545.76
7 even on Sunday so there no

554.079 --> 559.04
problem but uh yeah I've been very

556.48 --> 562.88
inspired by my own

559.04 --> 565.0
finding which is not a finding really

562.88 --> 566.8
and this is going to go a little deeper

565.0 --> 568.12
on it and this is going to happen

566.8 --> 571.3599999999999
probably a little

568.12 --> 574.2
more over the

571.36 --> 578.0
days just a lot of Dark World

574.2 --> 578.0
associations cuz I think

578.56 --> 584.88
that when I was young I think my parents

582.16 --> 588.56
literally the story about the

584.88 --> 591.88
Dynamo description inside of me like

588.56 --> 596.279
that's not something that I

591.88 --> 600.64
invented that's something that my

596.279 --> 604.4399999999999
mom like invented it's it's really

600.64 --> 606.4399999999999
difficult to for me to like fully even

604.44 --> 608.0400000000001
realize how because well she's not there

606.44 --> 610.8800000000001
anymore and it's like

608.04 --> 614.24
I in a way like

610.88 --> 614.24
assimilated her

615.24 --> 621.24
spirit so it feels like it comes from me

618.519 --> 624.16
but if I really think back then I can

621.24 --> 628.04
pinpoint roughly like very young when

624.16 --> 633.16
again when I was first starting to get

628.04 --> 633.16
these what they then called like manic

633.839 --> 639.5600000000001
depression manic

636.6 --> 643.16
depression that's like because of the

639.56 --> 647.1999999999999
very distinct up and downs and like also

643.16 --> 650.48
emotional ups and emotional Downs cuz I

647.2 --> 653.12
was overall very emotional especially at

650.48 --> 655.519
home on the outside I wouldn't really

653.12 --> 658.04
show it because I learned very quickly

655.519 --> 661.04
that people are offended by emotions

658.04 --> 661.04
usually

662.8 --> 668.5999999999999
you just get too honest to direct

666.68 --> 670.3199999999999
because I did that naturally as a kid

668.6 --> 675.639
it's like yeah

670.32 --> 680.0400000000001
that's optimal direct communication

675.639 --> 680.04
right I mean why

680.92 --> 686.4799999999999
not well because there's a lot of people

684.24 --> 686.48
that

687.079 --> 692.5999999999999
just they need a more

689.6 --> 696.519
limited window of

692.6 --> 700.6800000000001
Consciousness and they can't handle the

696.519 --> 704.079
real direct approach because that

700.68 --> 707.76
breaks their internal spell that creates

704.079 --> 709.3199999999999
that very specific type of window view

707.76 --> 712.76
on the world and themselves and what

709.32 --> 716.399
they're doing and how they feel about

712.76 --> 717.959
it because people need their delusions

716.399 --> 722.8
to keep doing what they're

717.959 --> 722.8
doing it's like a part of

723.279 --> 727.48
being you need to have a view on what

725.639 --> 729.399
you're doing and if you're not like

727.48 --> 730.9200000000001
actively seeking out a certain way of

729.399 --> 733.079
thinking about it then it will just

730.92 --> 735.56
happen

733.079 --> 737.519
naturally like you might just do

735.56 --> 740.6389999999999
something because of a direct response

737.519 --> 743.32
to something and then it's

740.639 --> 745.88
a it takes some time well while you're

743.32 --> 748.6800000000001
doing it you start to automatically

745.88 --> 749.48
build a view of what it is you're doing

748.68 --> 751.079
in

749.48 --> 755.279
what you can compare it

751.079 --> 758.68
to and if you really like it you might

755.279 --> 762.8389999999999
draw parallels with other for example

758.68 --> 766.399
fictional scenarios from books or movies

762.839 --> 770.639
that really inspire you and then like in

766.399 --> 770.639
your mind sort of parallel constructed a

770.959 --> 777.4799999999999
bit to like make the energy resonate

774.959 --> 780.68
from that onto what you're doing but

777.48 --> 784.76
it's all in your mind

780.68 --> 788.12
that part people just do that to do what

784.76 --> 790.36
they do better most of the time if they

788.12 --> 793.6
are able to use

790.36 --> 796.9590000000001
it but if somebody's like really

793.6 --> 801.12
vulnerable and really Direct that's very

796.959 --> 803.56
distracting and like it it grabs a it

801.12 --> 805.88
requires a lot of energy to just do that

803.56 --> 810.5999999999999
to be attuned to

805.88 --> 814.199
that but for me that's like normal

810.6 --> 814.1990000000001
for other people it's not so much

814.839 --> 822.399
normal so I guess that just by being who

818.6 --> 825.6800000000001
I was even when I was very young I would

822.399 --> 829.6
like this is very interesting

825.68 --> 830.68
comparison knock their inner Dynamo off

829.6 --> 834.0790000000001
the

830.68 --> 837.5999999999999
pedestal I would overwhelm them and that

834.079 --> 839.56
would effectively comparatively trigger

837.6 --> 842.279
a panic attack like a

839.56 --> 844.7589999999999
effect because I overwhelmed

842.279 --> 846.6
them like a lot of people that really

844.759 --> 848.0790000000001
thought they were really on top of

846.6 --> 851.12
things and that they were the smartest

848.079 --> 854.16
and all that and I was just like poof

851.12 --> 857.04
like really really

854.16 --> 861.279
heavily and I was almost a bit addicted

857.04 --> 863.92
to that which is like a weird surreal

861.279 --> 867.079
type of form of like spiritual sadism

863.92 --> 869.759
maybe but I mean philosophically I could

867.079 --> 872.8
argue like yeah doing that actually does

869.759 --> 875.519
help getting people real and more stable

872.8 --> 878.24
if if they weren't tested like that then

875.519 --> 881.639
they might like really believe it risk

878.24 --> 884.199
even more and then go into complete

881.639 --> 886.0
cataclysm well if their actual

884.199 --> 889.8
sensibilities are

886.0 --> 892.48
tested then they have some memory of

889.8 --> 895.199
like oh yeah wait I'm not actually that

892.48 --> 897.44
perfect I can think of it as that but I

895.199 --> 899.92
can't like really hold on to that when

897.44 --> 902.0
it's really important

899.92 --> 904.92
if you never test

902.0 --> 908.6
anybody

904.92 --> 912.399
then then they don't have the chance

908.6 --> 915.5600000000001
then they might just believe it all as

912.399 --> 915.56
it comes rolling in their

917.12 --> 922.88
mind whatever they're creating for

919.88 --> 922.88
themselves

923.56 --> 930.199
right hello dank good to see

927.6 --> 933.72
you

930.199 --> 937.279
but yeah my my mother I

933.72 --> 937.279
think was my

938.92 --> 944.8
father because my mother and father both

941.399 --> 947.16
had that understanding about it and both

944.8 --> 950.8389999999999
have issues they both have like a Dynamo

947.16 --> 953.88
they both could get like too much and

950.839 --> 956.759
then like ah chaos from the outside or

953.88 --> 961.0
nagging and then it's just boom they

956.759 --> 963.36
basically go Rin except that means total

961.0 --> 967.519
disarray in ways with my mother it's

963.36 --> 967.519
like they become like pushy and

968.0 --> 972.8
hysterical and trying to draw everybody

970.72 --> 975.44
in with their Panic very very

972.8 --> 978.199
demoralizing and annoying when my mother

975.44 --> 980.399
had that and my dad just went like

978.199 --> 982.5999999999999
completely like shut off from the entire

980.399 --> 985.92
world and like literally lock himself in

982.6 --> 989.0400000000001
a room and not come out for like 6 hours

985.92 --> 990.16
and like no loud music or anything

989.04 --> 992.8389999999999
sometimes he would just be playing

990.16 --> 994.8
guitar or something apparently but just

992.839 --> 998.3190000000001
completely retract and that was his

994.8 --> 1001.8
response to that to that mode that would

998.319 --> 1004.199
arrive where I have developed rinn

1001.8 --> 1007.88
actively but later in life because

1004.199 --> 1011.12
before I had absolutely no control like

1007.88 --> 1013.36
Rin when I was younger was

1011.12 --> 1016.72
effectively so

1013.36 --> 1020.319
overwhelming that it would just be like

1016.72 --> 1024.799
just ah scre scratch their eyes out and

1020.319 --> 1028.839
then kill myself if I'd actually had

1024.799 --> 1031.439
like given the r to that totally

1028.839 --> 1033.52
overwhelming very dangerous and I never

1031.439 --> 1036.72
did that that's probably the same

1033.52 --> 1038.959
mechanism as my dad why he went so

1036.72 --> 1041.16
retracted and I think it might be that

1038.959 --> 1043.0
the overwhelming Factor has a bit to do

1041.16 --> 1045.3600000000001
with like the

1043.0 --> 1046.199
Indonesian bloodline that goes through

1045.36 --> 1049.799
my

1046.199 --> 1053.28
dad that just made that makes that that

1049.799 --> 1055.6399999999999
modus Spirit mode getting overwhelmed

1053.28 --> 1059.0
going and overdrive

1055.64 --> 1059.0
like very

1059.12 --> 1065.28
overwhelming it it is apparently a thing

1062.72 --> 1070.44
so I was

1065.28 --> 1073.6399999999999
told through my dad's family basically

1070.44 --> 1079.3200000000002
and like all his brothers and all kids

1073.64 --> 1082.679
they're all super calm like super

1079.32 --> 1086.039
come and and they like I but I know for

1082.679 --> 1088.3200000000002
example that one of my nephews also has

1086.039 --> 1092.08
like these issues that I do where he's

1088.32 --> 1095.96
like so enjoyable such a great loving

1092.08 --> 1099.4399999999998
guy but if he gets over stressed he goes

1095.96 --> 1100.88
like a bit nutty and he can get like

1099.44 --> 1102.559
really

1100.88 --> 1105.24
aggressive

1102.559 --> 1107.32
like and he's like very ashamed about

1105.24 --> 1110.2
that too because it's like so out of

1107.32 --> 1111.9189999999999
character

1110.2 --> 1114.48
and it's

1111.919 --> 1117.48
like dealing with it very well but the

1114.48 --> 1120.799
point is is that like that's there it's

1117.48 --> 1124.24
like it's genetically still a little bit

1120.799 --> 1124.24
in there in the

1124.48 --> 1130.2
mix and I have that and that that's

1127.28 --> 1134.08
basically what I I blame r on my

1130.2 --> 1134.0800000000002
Indonesian but I

1134.84 --> 1141.4399999999998
mean there's a point to it too you know

1139.24 --> 1144.36
I mean I think of it like why would

1141.44 --> 1145.96
Indonesians have that well they're on

1144.36 --> 1148.9599999999998
Islands

1145.96 --> 1148.96
there

1149.88 --> 1154.8400000000001
and it must have developed out of like a

1152.88 --> 1156.44
long period of just like yeah we're just

1154.84 --> 1157.9189999999999
living with our families and our Islands

1156.44 --> 1160.679
we just love we would just want to go

1157.919 --> 1164.6000000000001
Inward and and then like outside just

1160.679 --> 1166.76
come ra and everybody

1164.6 --> 1170.4399999999998
like

1166.76 --> 1173.799
berserk just ch them in in pieces like

1170.44 --> 1177.64
ah and everybody goes in Amnesia

1173.799 --> 1180.08
like oh what happened wow look what

1177.64 --> 1182.72
happened on the beach

1180.08 --> 1186.6399999999999
oh the demons must have come and killed

1182.72 --> 1190.44
them all for us okay let's just get back

1186.64 --> 1193.88
to life right because like would they

1190.44 --> 1196.0
would like periodically get raided by

1193.88 --> 1198.4
also very vicious

1196.0 --> 1201.52
people that would probably want them as

1198.4 --> 1203.919
slaves or well maybe then they develop

1201.52 --> 1208.52
that weird Spirit maybe some Shaman at

1203.919 --> 1212.8400000000001
some point says like like we're going

1208.52 --> 1216.2
to like we can make the demons like our

1212.84 --> 1217.0
protectors maybe that's what that is is

1216.2 --> 1220.8400000000001
there's

1217.0 --> 1223.76
certain Spirits there and it is like in

1220.84 --> 1225.76
their religion too like sort of in

1223.76 --> 1228.96
between it I mean it's it's mostly

1225.76 --> 1231.039
become Islam now but but there's still

1228.96 --> 1235.0
like old tribal knowledge and all that

1231.039 --> 1239.24
they don't destroy that it's knowledge

1235.0 --> 1242.0
and it's very fascinating Just Like Old

1239.24 --> 1244.24
Dutch religion the old more Germanic

1242.0 --> 1247.4
type religion with their own Pantheon

1244.24 --> 1250.28
and all that Wan and all that sounds

1247.4 --> 1252.44
very much like the just the German

1250.28 --> 1254.32
Pantheon like that's also has

1252.44 --> 1256.96
interesting things to it like

1254.32 --> 1258.84
interesting details about regarding

1256.96 --> 1262.159
things and about just

1258.84 --> 1265.6
an ancient form of spirit

1262.159 --> 1267.679
mechanics that's like used in it as a

1265.6 --> 1269.48
template it's like a forgotten template

1267.679 --> 1271.6000000000001
of something that's very old and it's

1269.48 --> 1273.48
fascinating and Indonesian lore has that

1271.6 --> 1276.0
too in their old

1273.48 --> 1279.039
religions but I think that Indonesians

1276.0 --> 1281.279
just might have that among them as like

1279.039 --> 1283.52
a yeah a berserk defense it's like oh

1281.279 --> 1285.48
you're really loving and ni and then

1283.52 --> 1286.52
like a bunch of Maniacs come by and

1285.48 --> 1288.559
they're like they're going to they're

1286.52 --> 1291.52
going to rape and kill your everything

1288.559 --> 1294.559
and just like total hell and so it's

1291.52 --> 1298.559
like just Co

1294.559 --> 1300.6789999999999
completely demonically

1298.559 --> 1302.799
berserk like

1300.679 --> 1305.4
that I think that that's where that

1302.799 --> 1308.4
comes from that but that's why it's so

1305.4 --> 1310.919
intense because it had to be very acute

1308.4 --> 1313.279
very quick you can't like get scared you

1310.919 --> 1317.039
can't hesitate it's like

1313.279 --> 1319.32
immediately SL Slaughter it all just no

1317.039 --> 1322.32
thinking immediately slaughter them

1319.32 --> 1324.6399999999999
before they can damage anything and then

1322.32 --> 1326.799
yeah then you're all [ __ ] up but if

1324.64 --> 1328.8400000000001
then the overwhelmingness also triggers

1326.799 --> 1330.679
like an Amnesia effect would which would

1328.84 --> 1332.9599999999998
have to be there if you didn't have the

1330.679 --> 1334.3200000000002
Amnesia effect you'd probably die kill

1332.96 --> 1337.919
yourself

1334.32 --> 1340.52
afterward right So eventually that then

1337.919 --> 1343.3200000000002
encompasses

1340.52 --> 1345.32
it and then you have this mechanism like

1343.32 --> 1348.32
a defense mechanism like you can go

1345.32 --> 1352.039
absolutely berserk to like defend your

1348.32 --> 1356.279
family or whatever of monsters or like

1352.039 --> 1358.84
monstrous people and then just like oh

1356.279 --> 1363.0
completely forget about it

1358.84 --> 1366.799
and you'd compartmentalize

1363.0 --> 1369.039
it you just not really remember it and

1366.799 --> 1371.36
hey guess what everybody that you love

1369.039 --> 1371.36
is

1376.0 --> 1382.84
safe so I'm just theorizing in about the

1379.279 --> 1386.4
origins of this trait of

1382.84 --> 1389.6789999999999
mine because I'm not throwing it away

1386.4 --> 1393.3600000000001
I'm not oh my God I'm so not in control

1389.679 --> 1397.1200000000001
oh it's so unacceptable in society [ __ ]

1393.36 --> 1402.039
you yeah this is a thing in

1397.12 --> 1404.6399999999999
me it has a a reason it's there it must

1402.039 --> 1409.36
have all things that we have have a

1404.64 --> 1412.96
reason and it's only our own disillusion

1409.36 --> 1414.9599999999998
with God and like oh no God gave me this

1412.96 --> 1417.64
I don't want it because I'm too [ __ ]

1414.96 --> 1420.48
Petty to see from the my perspective

1417.64 --> 1422.4
where I am at with my understanding that

1420.48 --> 1423.96
maybe this thing might have had a really

1422.4 --> 1427.6000000000001
big function

1423.96 --> 1430.159
originally still has you just have to

1427.6 --> 1431.6789999999999
have the mental Clarity and

1430.159 --> 1434.5590000000002
understanding of God and how things are

1431.679 --> 1437.64
designed in order to be able to accept

1434.559 --> 1439.52
that and then give it a function instead

1437.64 --> 1441.8400000000001
of just seeing it as something that you

1439.52 --> 1445.0
want to compartmentalize out of yourself

1441.84 --> 1447.6789999999999
and potentially imagine how it would

1445.0 --> 1449.76
dissipate and no longer exist even

1447.679 --> 1451.799
though it is probably a core element to

1449.76 --> 1456.4
your entire

1451.799 --> 1458.44
person but you're just to Petty to see

1456.4 --> 1460.159
that from your

1458.44 --> 1462.76
contemporary

1460.159 --> 1464.679
perspective yeah that's society out

1462.76 --> 1467.279
there that's how how a lot of people in

1464.679 --> 1469.8400000000001
general tend to think because it's

1467.279 --> 1475.039
easiest the most

1469.84 --> 1478.039
simplest but it's foolish I think

1475.039 --> 1479.559
holistically with these kind of things

1478.039 --> 1482.64
if you have a

1479.559 --> 1485.2
trait if if a person has a certain type

1482.64 --> 1487.8400000000001
of craziness that means they have a

1485.2 --> 1490.559
certain type of

1487.84 --> 1494.32
talent and that's like how I always see

1490.559 --> 1497.84
it and like the format of that

1494.32 --> 1500.84
Affliction at first forces you to ad

1497.84 --> 1503.1999999999998
adapt and then build that Talent as a

1500.84 --> 1506.52
consequence or fail at it and just

1503.2 --> 1508.44
become crippled in your

1506.52 --> 1511.559
person but

1508.44 --> 1513.48
the it forces that talent and so if

1511.559 --> 1515.6399999999999
somebody has certain types of flaws then

1513.48 --> 1518.919
you know they have certain type of

1515.64 --> 1518.919
talents or Talent

1520.799 --> 1525.52
potential

1522.32 --> 1526.6789999999999
holistic holistic Spirit mechanics I'm

1525.52 --> 1530.12
going to

1526.679 --> 1535.159
actually I look like ssung from Mortal

1530.12 --> 1535.1589999999999
Kombat except he didn't no not

1536.0 --> 1541.36
really and you can't possibly be meaning

1542.72 --> 1552.48
like from the original movie bro he

1547.0 --> 1552.48
had much more Chinese looking

1554.919 --> 1559.679
no and more Brown

1560.559 --> 1565.8799999999999
but he did say your soul is

1572.88 --> 1580.72
mine I'll give you

1576.159 --> 1580.72
that all right be right

1586.6 --> 1589.6
back

1626.159 --> 1631.5590000000002
all

1628.08 --> 1636.279
right I watch all the ads you make Dy

1631.559 --> 1636.279
okay thank you duper I appreciate

1644.72 --> 1650.32
that uh because my mother is not

1648.12 --> 1653.6399999999999
Indonesian Ste

1650.32 --> 1656.84
traveler my dad is well that's where

1653.64 --> 1659.7990000000002
that comes from my brother is not like

1656.84 --> 1661.6789999999999
me my brother does not have like this

1659.799 --> 1665.519
rage

1661.679 --> 1667.279
win my brother was always very stoked he

1665.519 --> 1669.799
does have

1667.279 --> 1672.919
emotions but he's always been much

1669.799 --> 1677.2
better at locking him back has done that

1672.919 --> 1680.72
most of his teen teens I was not able I

1677.2 --> 1680.72
had a a lot of hysterical

1698.799 --> 1703.96
times so I don't know why you ask that

1701.72 --> 1708.0
stey Traer but that's just

1703.96 --> 1712.2
incorrect yeah my nephew yeah but that's

1708.0 --> 1715.88
nephew from my dad's side my dad had

1712.2 --> 1718.6000000000001
Brothers those Brothers had

1715.88 --> 1722.64
kids that's my

1718.6 --> 1727.08
nephew my mom also had a

1722.64 --> 1730.519
sister sister had kids those are also my

1727.08 --> 1734.12
nephews from my mom's

1730.519 --> 1735.08
side or cousins cousins nephew what

1734.12 --> 1739.399
those

1735.08 --> 1739.399
are oh what

1745.76 --> 1750.559
what the hell's the

1747.6 --> 1753.279
difference damn it did I mix it up again

1750.559 --> 1756.44
I hate those words it's so freaking it's

1753.279 --> 1756.44
always been confusing to

1766.32 --> 1771.2
me

1768.08 --> 1772.6789999999999
is there like a difference like a nephew

1771.2 --> 1776.24
comes

1772.679 --> 1780.159
through only through one

1776.24 --> 1780.159
side how the hell does this

1781.0 --> 1786.36
work only your brother's kids are

1788.2 --> 1794.8400000000001
nephews okay so it's really brother spe

1791.84 --> 1794.84
oh

1796.32 --> 1799.32
Jesus

1802.64 --> 1807.64
but that's

1804.64 --> 1807.64
not

1809.72 --> 1817.64
ah but what about the kids of my parents

1814.36 --> 1817.6399999999999
brothers that's

1822.08 --> 1829.76
cousins because in Dutch that's also

1826.24 --> 1831.64
nephews that's so that's that's like a

1829.76 --> 1833.8799999999999
language barrier thing then that that

1831.64 --> 1836.96
makes it hard for me to like we have no

1833.88 --> 1836.96
difference in the words

1837.96 --> 1845.0
there it's like you have your brother

1841.279 --> 1847.12
your sister then you have bad alongside

1845.0 --> 1851.48
your like whether it's kids from your

1847.12 --> 1855.1999999999998
own brother or from your parents

1851.48 --> 1859.24
Brothers they're all

1855.2 --> 1859.24
nephews and nieces basically

1864.32 --> 1869.32
basally right but if it's not your own

1867.24 --> 1873.84
Brothers It's because okay sorry I I

1869.32 --> 1873.84
mixed it up it's very

1879.679 --> 1885.0800000000002
confusing uncle's children's are cousins

1886.159 --> 1890.3200000000002
right

1888.12 --> 1893.32
right so cousin is basically one step

1890.32 --> 1893.32
further out of the

1895.159 --> 1903.0800000000002
family right it it that is it right like

1899.84 --> 1905.76
nephews are like three steps if you you

1903.08 --> 1910.399
have your brother then their kid a

1905.76 --> 1914.0
cousin is you your father or mother

1910.399 --> 1916.1999999999998
their sibling and then their kid and

1914.0 --> 1918.76
that's a cousin so there's like four

1916.2 --> 1920.799
versus three that that will help me

1918.76 --> 1924.559
remember it

1920.799 --> 1928.8799999999999
actually now that it clearly got a clear

1924.559 --> 1933.519
establishment of this

1928.88 --> 1933.519
difference cousin Sher said a grand

1942.24 --> 1949.08
right so but a cousin is basically a

1945.039 --> 1949.08
nephew that's one step further

1950.24 --> 1957.919
removed and it's all cousin is also can

1954.159 --> 1960.159
me fa male or female both right even

1957.919 --> 1960.159
more

1962.519 --> 1965.519
confusing

1972.6 --> 1979.039
right anyway hello borders boy

1982.039 --> 1984.639
blue pill

1998.039 --> 2002.919
Evolution cousins are not your

2005.96 --> 2008.96
okay

2013.2 --> 2019.3990000000001
but but what standard though is that

2014.919 --> 2019.3990000000001
like for Heritage

2024.279 --> 2031.24
standards H right anyway I'm going to

2027.44 --> 2033.3990000000001
eat this thing before it a damn it okay

2031.24 --> 2037.24
I'm going to put my Illuminati cant back

2033.399 --> 2039.84
in the oven because now it's cold [ __ ]

2037.24 --> 2044.08
and turn on my coffee I feel like feel

2039.84 --> 2048.5589999999997
like that too coffee hit very nicely

2044.08 --> 2048.5589999999997
yesterday and uh I'll be right

2065.879 --> 2068.879
back

2095.879 --> 2098.879
e

2106.48 --> 2113.44
too distant nothing to me okay borders

2111.24 --> 2116.7599999999998
boy that's really cool that you have so

2113.44 --> 2116.76
little care for your

2120.72 --> 2125.7999999999997
relations I didn't know like it's even

2123.64 --> 2127.44
important like oh my

2125.8 --> 2130.32
lineage

2127.44 --> 2132.28
like oh sorry like do you have like

2130.32 --> 2134.04
billions of inheritance are you like a

2132.28 --> 2136.96
king or something because yeah that is

2134.04 --> 2140.079
going to be really important but you're

2136.96 --> 2140.079
just some guy out

2148.359 --> 2154.16
there right I mean but eventually I mean

2151.319 --> 2157.96
there's an idea though it might become

2154.16 --> 2162.52
really important again why

2157.96 --> 2165.079
because of the insane amount of well

2162.52 --> 2167.24
genetic

2165.079 --> 2171.0
experimentation for all

2167.24 --> 2173.7599999999998
this these crazy experimental medical

2171.0 --> 2176.8
interventions that are happening

2173.76 --> 2180.28
recently that are said to affect

2176.8 --> 2184.44
genetically a lot and kill killing

2180.28 --> 2188.119
people right but because of

2184.44 --> 2191.44
that like Society

2188.119 --> 2195.4
will need to like have clear records

2191.44 --> 2198.16
of okay like you are actually

2195.4 --> 2200.8
fertile right cuz then you need to be

2198.16 --> 2203.7599999999998
like protected and like you'll probably

2200.8 --> 2207.1600000000003
get like procreation mandates eventually

2203.76 --> 2210.3190000000004
It's like because yeah

2207.16 --> 2212.96
society and just importing a bunch of

2210.319 --> 2215.359
trash from abroad it's not going to fix

2212.96 --> 2218.319
anything if that's the solution then

2215.359 --> 2220.7999999999997
it's all gone

2218.319 --> 2224.4
and the entire place will be completely

2220.8 --> 2227.1600000000003
unrecognizable like in in a matter of

2224.4 --> 2229.04
decades and then I mean completely in

2227.16 --> 2231.56
recognize there will be nobody there

2229.04 --> 2231.56
that you

2234.52 --> 2239.64
remember so if that can be

2237.88 --> 2243.319
availed

2239.64 --> 2246.0
then lineage is going to be more

2243.319 --> 2248.44
important because so many people have

2246.0 --> 2250.8
been gentically damaged and can't really

2248.44 --> 2255.119
procreate and like

2250.8 --> 2257.76
yeah pure blood is not going to be this

2255.119 --> 2259.839
trendy thing anymore in the background

2257.76 --> 2262.3190000000004
it might become like a matter of

2259.839 --> 2262.319
National

2262.96 --> 2269.8
Security and like that's not a

2267.0 --> 2272.079
joke I mean it still feels like that

2269.8 --> 2275.1600000000003
right now that's that's that's good

2272.079 --> 2278.0
right maybe it's

2275.16 --> 2279.52
overestimated how bad it it could be

2278.0 --> 2282.48
it's going to

2279.52 --> 2286.0
be

2282.48 --> 2290.28
but because of the overestimation lying

2286.0 --> 2292.44
in underestimating the

2290.28 --> 2294.5600000000004
insane

2292.44 --> 2298.8
elusive

2294.56 --> 2300.0789999999997
magnanimous design Dynamic power of of

2298.8 --> 2303.4
the

2300.079 --> 2306.92
Creator to make things despite

2303.4 --> 2309.599
everything be able to to work it out out

2306.92 --> 2311.8
somehow right I mean we thought that

2309.599 --> 2314.599
with the introduction of genetically

2311.8 --> 2318.92
modified corn in the

2314.599 --> 2322.44
9s that all of the Corn would be

2318.92 --> 2326.2400000000002
polluted and destroyed forever remember

2322.44 --> 2329.599
that but guess what God had a little

2326.24 --> 2332.16
trick up their sleeve up his sleeve Z he

2329.599 --> 2334.56
has a very big sleeve it's infinitely

2332.16 --> 2337.24
sized

2334.56 --> 2340.839
allegedly yeah cuz he has all the time

2337.24 --> 2343.5989999999997
in the world literally literally all the

2340.839 --> 2347.2
time so he has like the sleeve is

2343.599 --> 2349.0
unlimited size right and P little trick

2347.2 --> 2350.839
out guess what all the genetically

2349.0 --> 2352.76
modified corn was even being spread out

2350.839 --> 2355.16
in regular corn fields and like oh my

2352.76 --> 2357.119
God it's getting sued and all the dam

2355.16 --> 2361.0
the crop damage is not reliable anymore

2357.119 --> 2364.7200000000003
well guess what it's all gone now the

2361.0 --> 2366.64
genetically modified corn just got bred

2364.72 --> 2369.16
out of existence it it just

2366.64 --> 2372.4
disintegrated

2369.16 --> 2375.8799999999997
itself because this idea oh we're gonna

2372.4 --> 2378.96
destroy it oh oh we're going to introdu

2375.88 --> 2382.48
oh my God they made a new hybrid

2378.96 --> 2384.7200000000003
pathogen oh this is unnatural never seen

2382.48 --> 2388.2
before well I guarantee you it's going

2384.72 --> 2390.0
to evaporate very quickly might have a

2388.2 --> 2392.4399999999996
little bit of a weird effect and then

2390.0 --> 2395.4
it's going to be just

2392.44 --> 2397.28
like yeah that's not supposed to be

2395.4 --> 2399.88
there

2397.28 --> 2401.8390000000004
and it's just oh like it never was there

2399.88 --> 2404.28
because it's not supposed to be there

2401.839 --> 2406.7599999999998
it's not part of the design it's a

2404.28 --> 2410.6400000000003
natural truly a natural

2406.76 --> 2414.1600000000003
and the emergency backup systems is like

2410.64 --> 2417.44
the subsystems of the entire arrangement

2414.16 --> 2419.68
of life and how it works like all of the

2417.44 --> 2423.079
subsystems come out of the workings it's

2419.68 --> 2425.319
like the agents within the Matrix of the

2423.079 --> 2427.0
design of life itself they all come out

2425.319 --> 2428.68
and just like

2427.0 --> 2432.72
yeah

2428.68 --> 2435.0
overwhelmingly getting rid of this like

2432.72 --> 2437.1189999999997
like we have consciously nothing to do

2435.0 --> 2439.64
with that yeah that's what's happening

2437.119 --> 2441.7200000000003
it's like the Matrix agents of the

2439.64 --> 2445.16
design of life itself just come in there

2441.72 --> 2448.3999999999996
it's like yeah that's not going to

2445.16 --> 2449.72
happen yeah it happens with genetically

2448.4 --> 2453.839
modified

2449.72 --> 2457.48
foods they just they don't procreate

2453.839 --> 2460.7999999999997
they can't ruin they can't infect

2457.48 --> 2463.28
living cycles it it just it goes away

2460.8 --> 2465.28
and it's logical too if you really think

2463.28 --> 2468.3590000000004
about it on a more rudimentary

2465.28 --> 2470.0
philosophical level right with mutation

2468.359 --> 2472.64
what's known about mutation yeah when

2470.0 --> 2476.359
you mutate things what happens it become

2472.64 --> 2479.359
irrational aggressive and

2476.359 --> 2480.88
sterile irrational aggressive sterile

2479.359 --> 2484.7999999999997
irrational aggressive well guess what

2480.88 --> 2487.0
all those traits not very useful for

2484.8 --> 2489.6800000000003
procreation and

2487.0 --> 2495.079
sustaining yourself they're all a burden

2489.68 --> 2497.839
on that so naturally logically that

2495.079 --> 2500.48
means it just goes away and leaves room

2497.839 --> 2504.24
for the things that don't do

2500.48 --> 2506.96
that over the procreation life cycle

2504.24 --> 2509.3999999999996
whether that's on a cellular micro level

2506.96 --> 2513.359
or literally on a species

2509.4 --> 2513.359
level procreating

2515.24 --> 2522.52
sexually so now there's oh my God

2518.52 --> 2526.319
there's the new pathogen disease

2522.52 --> 2527.88
X or like oh my God they gave us these

2526.319 --> 2529.24
dude there's this weird stories going

2527.88 --> 2532.2000000000003
around

2529.24 --> 2534.8799999999997
now apparently in United States all this

2532.2 --> 2537.2799999999997
weird crazy vaccines have just been

2534.88 --> 2540.0
passed I I

2537.28 --> 2544.3190000000004
mean yeah whatever it's it's going to

2540.0 --> 2544.319
make it rounds Alex Jones broke it

2544.8 --> 2551.1600000000003
yesterday and yeah we'll see I don't

2548.0 --> 2553.92
think it really even matters I mean oh

2551.16 --> 2555.839
my God they're [ __ ] so again it's oh

2553.92 --> 2558.76
if well if you're

2555.839 --> 2560.88
weak you [ __ ] yourself over and your

2558.76 --> 2563.76
medical system you're continually

2560.88 --> 2565.48
injected poison and weird alterating

2563.76 --> 2568.3190000000004
crap that

2565.48 --> 2571.28
completely like derailed the natural

2568.319 --> 2573.92
function of your body in order

2571.28 --> 2575.8
to fix a problem that's not there

2573.92 --> 2577.28
because it was made up and you believed

2575.8 --> 2580.1600000000003
it

2577.28 --> 2581.92
right it might hurt there one time and

2580.16 --> 2584.68
then you got rolled into that entire

2581.92 --> 2584.6800000000003
nonsense

2586.52 --> 2591.2
right well yeah if you completely [ __ ]

2589.16 --> 2593.839
your own system yeah oh there might be

2591.2 --> 2595.2799999999997
some weird freaky new ways you can get

2593.839 --> 2597.7999999999997
sick

2595.28 --> 2603.0
now but that doesn't count for the

2597.8 --> 2603.0
people that aren't freaking [ __ ]

2603.319 --> 2609.52
medically they're not going to have any

2607.119 --> 2612.1600000000003
issues

2609.52 --> 2617.04
whatsoever do that how this work now

2612.16 --> 2618.68
yeah the entire hype Panic curve system

2617.04 --> 2621.64
the whole media scam with all the

2618.68 --> 2624.0789999999997
medical crap in all directions and what

2621.64 --> 2626.4
they keep trying the scheme it all just

2624.079 --> 2629.44
works on the people that have damaged

2626.4 --> 2632.96
immune system from previous procedures

2629.44 --> 2635.0
that's their Market Target group now

2632.96 --> 2636.88
that's who that nonsense is for in the

2635.0 --> 2639.599
fear mongering about oh oh my God they

2636.88 --> 2644.2000000000003
they this they did this oh they the

2639.599 --> 2646.76
sheding all that is only targeted at

2644.2 --> 2652.2
that group because the rest of us it's

2646.76 --> 2655.0400000000004
like nothing literally nothing happens

2652.2 --> 2659.319
ever and you might get overstressed from

2655.04 --> 2661.44
all the suggestions though physically

2659.319 --> 2662.64
nothing yeah nothing out of the order

2661.44 --> 2664.16
yeah you're still going to get a cold

2662.64 --> 2667.72
you're still going to get suddenly a lot

2664.16 --> 2670.7999999999997
of big flu or sinus in something right

2667.72 --> 2673.839
it's just that's normal it's always been

2670.8 --> 2676.48
like that it was like that 30 years

2673.839 --> 2680.16
ago I'm going to get my coffee and my

2676.48 --> 2680.16
Illuminati C I'll be right

2694.96 --> 2697.96
back

2776.48 --> 2782.72
C what the [ __ ]

2780.04 --> 2788.4
bro

2782.72 --> 2791.3999999999996
um how about you don't bring that up in

2788.4 --> 2791.4
my chat rare

2791.92 --> 2794.92
opportunity

2795.76 --> 2799.8
HH the [ __ ] is wrong with

2814.8 --> 2817.8
you

2822.4 --> 2828.28
what the [ __ ] okay Tom I don't know what

2825.16 --> 2830.319
what you're on about anyway I hope you

2828.28 --> 2834.3190000000004
uh found my

2830.319 --> 2838.16
uh little roll out there

2834.319 --> 2838.16
insightful don't worry about

2840.88 --> 2847.1600000000003
it realize that viruses don't actually

2845.04 --> 2849.92
exist in the ordance to the model that

2847.16 --> 2852.96
they attributed with

2849.92 --> 2856.76
virology and a lot even a lot of these

2852.96 --> 2861.0
studies in Laboratories G of

2856.76 --> 2864.3590000000004
function what they're actually testing

2861.0 --> 2866.8
is they're like screwing around with

2864.359 --> 2869.4
like the natural response systems of the

2866.8 --> 2872.8
body and just looking

2869.4 --> 2874.7200000000003
like how they can just like mess around

2872.8 --> 2878.319
with

2874.72 --> 2881.3999999999996
that but that doesn't happen

2878.319 --> 2885.48
naturally if you have that like type of

2881.4 --> 2887.64
response mechanism thingy in you

2885.48 --> 2889.8
externally guess what happens same

2887.64 --> 2893.44
happens as when you throw a bunch of GMO

2889.8 --> 2893.44
corn in a regular corn

2893.8 --> 2899.96
field yeah there might be one plant

2896.599 --> 2903.04
there and then yeah when it's get picks

2899.96 --> 2905.0
it gets thrown away because it's crap or

2903.04 --> 2908.119
somebody might eat it accidentally and

2905.0 --> 2912.2
then it's just gone again right because

2908.119 --> 2915.2000000000003
you have your own mechanism that does

2912.2 --> 2918.04
that supposed virus it's it's literally

2915.2 --> 2920.2
a cleanup system in your body one of the

2918.04 --> 2923.319
Miracles of

2920.2 --> 2926.0789999999997
God and as long as you don't like

2923.319 --> 2927.64
actively try to rearrange your entire

2926.079 --> 2930.52
body's

2927.64 --> 2934.2
mechanism by like some kind of

2930.52 --> 2936.319
experimental jab of some kind right then

2934.2 --> 2941.52
there's literally nothing nothing it

2936.319 --> 2945.64
could do to you ever you dumb

2941.52 --> 2948.119
asses don't listen to their crazy

2945.64 --> 2951.92
virology fear porn

2948.119 --> 2951.92
stories it's really

2952.2 --> 2957.96
Petty it doesn't work like that it only

2954.96 --> 2957.96
works like that in

2958.16 --> 2966.5589999999997
movies those movies are

2962.2 --> 2971.68
there to to give you little sniffs

2966.559 --> 2975.88
Snippets of propaganda to make you more

2971.68 --> 2978.8799999999997
eager to buy into medical industrial

2975.88 --> 2978.88
complex

2981.0 --> 2986.72
scams that's why that

2984.04 --> 2988.5589999999997
happens I bet a lot of movies out there

2986.72 --> 2993.7599999999998
just

2988.559 --> 2995.7200000000003
get standard budget based on how many of

2993.76 --> 2999.6400000000003
these markers they have in their their

2995.72 --> 3001.68
movies like do you have fear porn about

2999.64 --> 3003.96
nuclear bombs do you have fear porn

3001.68 --> 3006.5989999999997
about celestial events do you fear porn

3003.96 --> 3010.52
about medical

3006.599 --> 3012.44
threats and that's like they want it

3010.52 --> 3014.48
that's like ads for them that makes

3012.44 --> 3016.64
people afraid of that thinking of that

3014.48 --> 3019.92
and then they're more vulnerable to that

3016.64 --> 3023.359
kind of scam from the industrial comp

3019.92 --> 3028.2000000000003
respective industrial complexes you see

3023.359 --> 3028.2
the movies are your program for

3038.04 --> 3045.24
them but if you see

3041.44 --> 3048.2000000000003
it then you can see how it is a scam how

3045.24 --> 3052.319
the in the movies Their Fear porn is a

3048.2 --> 3054.4399999999996
scam to try to drive you into their

Mercy

3063.4 --> 3071.4
never been done particulate yeah I know

3067.079 --> 3071.4
the virus Mo model is complete

3072.16 --> 3077.839
bunk even the way they supposedly test

3074.92 --> 3084.319
for viruses is absolutely

3077.839 --> 3084.319
absurd and blatently not a natural

3084.359 --> 3089.48
environment like oh yeah you have to

3086.44 --> 3091.52
take a piece of Flesh and then like

3089.48 --> 3093.4
douse it in a bunch of poison do some

3091.52 --> 3095.559
stuff with it then douse it in some

3093.4 --> 3096.92
other poison then you like mix it up and

3095.559 --> 3099.3190000000004
then you ground it up and then you

3096.92 --> 3101.2400000000002
extract it and you filter it and then

3099.319 --> 3104.079
you put some other poison in it and oh

3101.24 --> 3108.799
look there's a virus like what the [ __ ]

3104.079 --> 3111.92
is this nonsense yeah that's not nature

3108.799 --> 3111.92
that's just a

3113.2 --> 3119.24
scam that you trying to make a a

3115.599 --> 3121.2000000000003
painting out of cell debris Gore you're

3119.24 --> 3126.0789999999997
making a

3121.2 --> 3126.0789999999997
painting it's not a natural thing it's

3133.48 --> 3140.559
ridiculous I deleted your post rare

3137.559 --> 3140.559
opportunity

3141.68 --> 3146.64
yeah there's certain things I don't want

3144.359 --> 3149.0789999999997
to be brought up

3146.64 --> 3149.0789999999997
certain

3151.28 --> 3156.6800000000003
words right anyway I'm going to eat my

3153.4 --> 3158.92
Illuminati KAS before it gets cold again

3156.68 --> 3158.9199999999996
so

3172.65 --> 3177.2400000000002
[Music]

3174.24 --> 3177.24
cheers

3186.839 --> 3191.5589999999997
reminds you of a witch brewing a potion

3189.64 --> 3195.52
oh what they don't tell you about BR

3191.559 --> 3199.0400000000004
witches brewing potions is that the

3195.52 --> 3201.44
stuff they throw in is

3199.04 --> 3204.52
only one

3201.44 --> 3205.799
side because the real witches brew

3204.52 --> 3211.079
potion

3205.799 --> 3211.079
is the impregnation of spiritual

3211.2 --> 3217.799
intent the spirit the intention is what

3214.96 --> 3220.0
is siphoned from the witch into the

3217.799 --> 3223.28
potion that's why they have to be there

3220.0 --> 3225.559
stirring and not just throw it there and

3223.28 --> 3228.599
then go watch television as it's Brewing

3225.559 --> 3230.48
no they have to be there do that because

3228.599 --> 3235.52
the main component of an actual witch's

3230.48 --> 3237.72
Ru to whatever end is the intention of

3235.52 --> 3239.319
the witch the spirit

3237.72 --> 3244.3999999999996
component

3239.319 --> 3244.4
yeah and they don't tell you that

3246.28 --> 3250.6800000000003
typically those are things that I've

3248.24 --> 3250.68
learned

3251.359 --> 3260.16
though I mean when I

3255.079 --> 3262.319
cook I typically do that in minor ways

3260.16 --> 3264.0789999999997
with intention it's like impregnate your

3262.319 --> 3267.119
food you're cooking with

3264.079 --> 3268.48
intention you have any idea how well

3267.119 --> 3271.88
that

3268.48 --> 3274.119
works you can like enchant your food

3271.88 --> 3277.4
with

3274.119 --> 3280.2000000000003
that in a very positive

3277.4 --> 3282.92
way I would never recommend you do that

3280.2 --> 3285.2
in a negative

3282.92 --> 3288.2000000000003
way

3285.2 --> 3288.2
but

3294.079 --> 3300.799
yeah

3296.72 --> 3304.2799999999997
H do I think vaccines have Spirit

3300.799 --> 3304.28
yes yes they

3306.16 --> 3312.52
do my healer talks about them all the

3309.2 --> 3313.64
time there's all kinds of weird crazy

3312.52 --> 3315.68
thoughts and

3313.64 --> 3318.44
mechanisms that

3315.68 --> 3321.52
literally are

3318.44 --> 3324.039
imbued I mean you could almost and this

3321.52 --> 3326.359
this sounds almost ridiculous especially

3324.039 --> 3329.48
since it's been used in memes and all

3326.359 --> 3331.359
that but you can almost just imagine

3329.48 --> 3333.039
that if you take like a vaccine like

3331.359 --> 3337.2799999999997
that just don't imagine

3333.039 --> 3339.44
it but in a way you get like miniature

3337.28 --> 3342.1600000000003
Bill Gates

3339.44 --> 3345.68
faces in your

3342.16 --> 3349.2799999999997
system like there like how he is what he

3345.68 --> 3349.2799999999997
wants like that's in you

3350.92 --> 3355.28
now and it will remain does it has a

3353.599 --> 3358.1600000000003
resonating property too is it's like

3355.28 --> 3361.7200000000003
it's not the end of it

3358.16 --> 3366.96
dude I think under the right conditions

3361.72 --> 3366.9599999999996
like they can literally like use people

3367.319 --> 3376.44
like a remote control zombie using

3372.96 --> 3376.44
Voodoo through the

3376.72 --> 3381.8799999999997
vaccines and yes I'm saying that with a

3379.44 --> 3381.88
straight

3383.92 --> 3386.92
face

3391.72 --> 3397.5989999999997
I mean it seems all very unlikely but I

3394.559 --> 3397.599
think they're actually

3398.16 --> 3402.64
trying I think they're they're trying

3403.319 --> 3407.5589999999997
the the Indiana Jones

3409.079 --> 3416.28
2 approach with the drink Tali ma the

3413.359 --> 3419.44
fact is that and mind

3416.28 --> 3421.599
control but mind control is not like oh

3419.44 --> 3424.16
there's a computer in your head that

3421.599 --> 3427.2000000000003
give you like robotic no no there is

3424.16 --> 3430.0389999999998
like a weird Spirit component to it too

3427.2 --> 3435.0789999999997
it's the surrender to a spirit in a

3430.039 --> 3437.6800000000003
way that spirit is them like that is the

3435.079 --> 3440.079
the demon thing that's actually driving

3437.68 --> 3442.839
Bill Gates and fouchi and all these

3440.079 --> 3446.3590000000004
people

3442.839 --> 3448.64
billionaires it's not that of Flesh

3446.359 --> 3450.52
that's doing that it's the spirit behind

3448.64 --> 3452.8799999999997
it that's doing that and that Spirit

3450.52 --> 3457.48
behind it is also the thing you get into

3452.88 --> 3462.359
contact with once you engage with

3457.48 --> 3465.599
their transhumanist transp spiritual

3462.359 --> 3465.5989999999997
machines and

3466.24 --> 3472.0789999999997
systems have you ever built a voodoo

3468.839 --> 3476.799
doll what the [ __ ]

3472.079 --> 3476.799
no that's [ __ ] evil

3480.28 --> 3486.2000000000003
I don't want to be enslaved to demonic

3482.76 --> 3486.2000000000003
beings the rest of my life

3490.799 --> 3494.96
thanks yeah they already are there's

3493.359 --> 3499.319
nothing holding them

3494.96 --> 3502.799
back it's like oh how many eternities of

3499.319 --> 3506.0389999999998
hell do you want one eternity two

3502.799 --> 3509.2
eternities three eternities

3506.039 --> 3511.76
like oh well let's just make it as many

3509.2 --> 3514.52
as possible then like

3511.76 --> 3516.88
that's that's their position that's

3514.52 --> 3516.88
where they

3518.2 --> 3521.9199999999996
are they're just like okay well let's do

3520.64 --> 3525.48
it all

3521.92 --> 3529.16
then right I mean what does another

3525.48 --> 3531.2
eternity of Hell matter more just

3529.16 --> 3533.44
another drop in the

3531.2 --> 3536.3999999999996
bucket

3533.44 --> 3538.319
see and then that's not my position

3536.4 --> 3541.079
though

3538.319 --> 3543.4
yeah I still have a stake in the game

3541.079 --> 3545.559
here

3543.4 --> 3548.079
spiritually so I'm not going to [ __ ]

3545.559 --> 3548.079
around with

3563.64 --> 3566.64
voodoo

3582.16 --> 3586.5989999999997
any thoughts on

3583.599 --> 3586.599
Eugenics

3588.28 --> 3593.6400000000003
uh Eugenics was really originally a

3591.24 --> 3595.319
higher intellectual

3593.64 --> 3598.48
concept

3595.319 --> 3601.5589999999997
but then a bunch of crazy Marxist

3598.48 --> 3607.0
atheist freaks got their hands on the

3601.559 --> 3607.0
concept and they turn it into a demonic

3611.68 --> 3618.2
ideology but I mean the original preface

3615.079 --> 3619.599
of eugenics it's all about leadership

3618.2 --> 3624.64
and

3619.599 --> 3627.799
survival right but yeah if you draw IR

3624.64 --> 3630.799
Ral views and delusions into that then

3627.799 --> 3632.88
anything goes it's like yeah we can just

3630.799 --> 3635.52
make up whatever excuse to like

3632.88 --> 3637.44
exterminate everybody because there's

3635.52 --> 3640.16
always a reason that everybody's going

3637.44 --> 3642.28
to die that's going to be the fault of

3640.16 --> 3643.3999999999996
there being too many people because we

3642.28 --> 3646.4
say

3643.4 --> 3650.039
so and that's how the Eugenics is turned

3646.4 --> 3652.1600000000003
into a delusional demonic

3650.039 --> 3655.119
ideology original

3652.16 --> 3657.1189999999997
Eugenics was basically common sense and

3655.119 --> 3659.7200000000003
like how do

3657.119 --> 3663.96
you use the people that can keep the

3659.72 --> 3666.64
cooler Minds to prevent people's

3663.96 --> 3668.92
Panic from destroying everyone and

3666.64 --> 3671.96
everything that everybody dies that's

3668.92 --> 3674.359
what Eugenics originally was

3671.96 --> 3679.4
for and now it's turned into this

3674.359 --> 3679.4
demonic ideology because of

3680.079 --> 3686.92
delusion and that's the main

3682.52 --> 3688.64
problem eugenics can never be

3686.92 --> 3693.92
forbidden

3688.64 --> 3695.48
but you can lay very very harsh and

3693.92 --> 3697.599
strict

3695.48 --> 3701.0
restrictions

3697.599 --> 3703.76
on who is allowed to basically touch

3701.0 --> 3705.88
it who's allowed to be to have

3703.76 --> 3711.44
responsibilities in that

3705.88 --> 3711.44
direction based on their level of

3712.88 --> 3718.92
sanity it's like oh you're like provably

3716.279 --> 3721.2
delusional as in you see

3718.92 --> 3724.2400000000002
things in your

3721.2 --> 3726.4399999999996
mind about reality and you impose them

3724.24 --> 3728.359
on real when it's not it's literally not

3726.44 --> 3730.68
that it's provably not that well that's

3728.359 --> 3733.839
provable delusion person like that

3730.68 --> 3737.72
should not get involved with Eugenics

3733.839 --> 3737.72
and definitely not get

3738.16 --> 3746.359
anything that resembles power or the

3741.319 --> 3746.359
ability to determine how things happen

3747.92 --> 3753.119
yeah anywhere in the directions of being

3750.92 --> 3754.839
being able to apply Eugenics it's like

3753.119 --> 3757.7200000000003
it's very

3754.839 --> 3761.64
simple Eugenics should not be in the

3757.72 --> 3761.64
hands of people that are provably

3763.039 --> 3768.3590000000004
delusional CU in their hands it's just

3765.96 --> 3771.68
an indiscriminate murder

3768.359 --> 3776.359
weapon to to satiate their demonic

3771.68 --> 3776.359
pleasure of Exterminating everything

3787.92 --> 3793.64
hey Godzilla the projection is real yeah

3791.039 --> 3795.7990000000004
of course the projection is

3793.64 --> 3799.68
real don't know what you're exactly

3795.799 --> 3799.68
referring to weird way to enter the

3803.279 --> 3806.279
chat

3830.03 --> 3833.139
[Applause]

3833.279 --> 3836.279
what

3868.73 --> 3871.8
[Applause]

3893.16 --> 3896.16
that

3908.92 --> 3914.52
now let's do it like this I got a

3911.48 --> 3917.48
title holistic Spirit mechanics and

3914.52 --> 3920.44
Eugenics plus delusion is demonic

3917.48 --> 3920.44
ideology what do you

3922.92 --> 3927.64
think wow

3924.799 --> 3930.0389999999998
wow yeah I'm not even going to dagy that

3927.64 --> 3930.0389999999998
with a

3942.68 --> 3947.5989999999997
response L pastur first postulated a

3945.559 --> 3951.279
virus Theory and he recanted on his

3947.599 --> 3954.119
deathbed good on him it's a bit late

3951.279 --> 3957.799
though I mean God's probably very

3954.119 --> 3961.92
favorable and then like wow okay so so

3957.799 --> 3965.24
you admit you were like unbelievably

3961.92 --> 3967.599
foolish it's like yeah okay well you

3965.24 --> 3971.279
still have your soul now after

3967.599 --> 3975.559
death but you're going to have to see

3971.279 --> 3978.319
the world and how what you did became a

3975.559 --> 3980.1600000000003
Cornerstone like one of the weapons in

3978.319 --> 3983.64
the belt of the

3980.16 --> 3987.44
devil that he's using to literally like

3983.64 --> 3988.5589999999997
damage and attack Humanity with the rest

3987.44 --> 3992.64
of

3988.559 --> 3995.44
History must be fun Lou oh would you oh

3992.64 --> 3997.359
oh death bed R oh you're safe though but

4082.279 --> 4087.64
right the strong and intelligent Will

4085.24 --> 4090.7599999999998
Survive not

4087.64 --> 4096.4
necessarily J

4090.76 --> 4096.400000000001
Massi it's mostly those that are the

4097.88 --> 4102.6
self-reliant and not easily

4102.839 --> 4107.64
fooled

4105.12 --> 4109.839
yeah self-reliant and not easily fooled

4107.64 --> 4112.4800000000005
is going to be the ones that are going

4109.839 --> 4112.48
to survive

4117.96 --> 4123.4800000000005
it because all these people out there

4121.48 --> 4126.718999999999
that have been like too dependent or

4123.48 --> 4129.799
like too hooked into like too many

4126.719 --> 4130.719
contracts too reliant upon society and

4129.799 --> 4133.2789999999995
the

4130.719 --> 4134.92
government they basically made a gamble

4133.279 --> 4138.679
on that the the government was still

4134.92 --> 4140.52
going to help the way they've helped and

4138.679 --> 4143.1990000000005
then everything changed and then they

4140.52 --> 4144.56
literally lose everything but since they

4143.199 --> 4147.48
can't handle it since they're

4144.56 --> 4150.52
contemplating death they're like yeah

4147.48 --> 4152.718999999999
I'll take that shot it might just help

4150.52 --> 4156.040000000001
me through it and not see my entire

4152.719 --> 4158.799
world destroyed but it's going to be

4156.04 --> 4161.64
destroyed and they refuse to face it so

4158.799 --> 4165.359
they rather take a Russian Roulette on

4161.64 --> 4167.839
the off chance that either I'll be dead

4165.359 --> 4170.319
or I'll make it through that's what

4167.839 --> 4173.08
really happened with all these people

4170.319 --> 4175.799
why that's why we got all this sudden

4173.08 --> 4180.5199999999995
sudden died suddenly now

4175.799 --> 4182.159
why because they were so unbelievably

4180.52 --> 4185.92
[ __ ]

4182.159 --> 4188.159
dependent on government and on entire

4185.92 --> 4192.2390000000005
Society to be

4188.159 --> 4194.5599999999995
this helpful monolithic thing to

4192.239 --> 4197.599999999999
them that they in entangled themselves

4194.56 --> 4200.84
on all sides yeah but guess what yeah

4197.6 --> 4202.84
that entanglement it rips it moves it

4200.84 --> 4204.679
goes back and forth eventually all that

4202.84 --> 4207.400000000001
entanglement suddenly going to rip you

4204.679 --> 4208.4800000000005
apart and it happens always it can't

4207.4 --> 4211.32
help

4208.48 --> 4212.839999999999
itself yeah so if you do that and you

4211.32 --> 4214.759999999999
think it's always going to be all right

4212.84 --> 4215.88
well then one day it's not going to be

4214.76 --> 4218.159000000001
all right and then you're probably going

4215.88 --> 4218.159000000001
to

4219.08 --> 4225.64
die especially

4222.64 --> 4225.64
now

4233.52 --> 4241.0
hey dip [ __ ] how

4236.719 --> 4241.0
about get the [ __ ] out of my chat

4252.64 --> 4255.64
scumbag

4265.28 --> 4269.32
people willfully lined up for experiment

4267.8 --> 4272.0
yeah but that's because of the

4269.32 --> 4276.92
conditioning programs right they've all

4272.0 --> 4281.679
been like all you have to do is whatever

4276.92 --> 4284.4800000000005
they say you do do it and and you will

4281.679 --> 4287.4
get a better

4284.48 --> 4290.12
social credit score basically and get

4287.4 --> 4293.92
better jobs get better payments that's

4290.12 --> 4297.28
how they [ __ ] taught all these kids

4293.92 --> 4300.84
and people and adults out

4297.28 --> 4303.239
there with the new waves of

4300.84 --> 4307.84
education so all these people are

4303.239 --> 4307.839999999999
literally standing in line to

4308.08 --> 4313.76
die and they didn't have anything else

4311.08 --> 4316.36
they were just do doing as they were

4313.76 --> 4318.76
told like that's what you do that's how

4316.36 --> 4324.679
you get ahead in society yeah no that's

4318.76 --> 4324.679
how you die you dumb

4326.92 --> 4334.0
idiot yeah there's no

4330.56 --> 4337.04
machine that that'll hook you up and

4334.0 --> 4340.6
carry you around Society even to the

4337.04 --> 4342.92
King's throne and do everything for you

4340.6 --> 4346.120000000001
yeah that's not how this world works

4342.92 --> 4348.12
that's how it will never work it only

4346.12 --> 4350.92
does that do you know the one thing that

4348.12 --> 4354.239
does do that what that is that hook yeah

4350.92 --> 4359.4
that's the meat hook the meat hook will

4354.239 --> 4362.04
come and pick you up treat you give you

4359.4 --> 4363.239
everything before you get slaughtered

4362.04 --> 4367.8
and

4363.239 --> 4369.44
eaten yeah that's what that is and

4367.8 --> 4374.56
that's what's

4369.44 --> 4378.239
happened there's no glorious spiritual

4374.56 --> 4380.52
automated system that will lift some

4378.239 --> 4383.718999999999
weirdo ignorant idiot that barely even

4380.52 --> 4387.320000000001
knows what reality is and then like help

4383.719 --> 4391.4
you through everything and help you give

4387.32 --> 4394.84
you the right things that doesn't exist

4391.4 --> 4397.759999999999
idiots you're lucky to even have parents

4394.84 --> 4400.8
that will do that with you for a while

4397.76 --> 4404.56
yeah the government definitely doesn't

4400.8 --> 4407.56
[ __ ] do that yeah

4404.56 --> 4410.400000000001
they might do it if you have a self

4407.56 --> 4413.400000000001
sense of self-reliance Independence and

4410.4 --> 4417.04
identity and then try

4413.4 --> 4420.5199999999995
to contract the government for such a

4417.04 --> 4422.92
thing you demand it from them you don't

4420.52 --> 4425.96
just go to them and then expect them to

4422.92 --> 4428.4800000000005
do that you can get something from them

4425.96 --> 4430.2390000000005
you can contract them and then they work

4428.48 --> 4431.638999999999
for you and then they do what you do

4430.239 --> 4434.239
what you're asking them to do but

4431.639 --> 4436.36
because you're in control you're the one

4434.239 --> 4438.678999999999
with the plan you're the one that's

4436.36 --> 4440.839999999999
wanting to take responsibility for it if

4438.679 --> 4444.4400000000005
you don't it doesn't work they'll just

4440.84 --> 4447.28
hook you up like a piece of meat to the

4444.44 --> 4449.199
slaughter house and then you get eaten

4447.28 --> 4452.199
that's what that's what the automated

4449.199 --> 4457.239
government things

4452.199 --> 4459.08
do yeah never just do what the

4457.239 --> 4462.28
government says

4459.08 --> 4466.719
ever never do

4462.28 --> 4468.719
that never unconditionally do what a

4466.719 --> 4471.88
government worker tells you to do

4468.719 --> 4476.32
without reasoning through it see and

4471.88 --> 4478.6
derive logic as to why they said that

4476.32 --> 4481.5199999999995
what they want to achieve and then make

4478.6 --> 4485.6
a conscious rational choice about

4481.52 --> 4489.360000000001
it never just blankly do what they say

4485.6 --> 4492.8
ever if you do that you'll be a piece of

4489.36 --> 4495.28
meat on a hook ready to get eaten within

4492.8 --> 4495.28
no time

4507.36 --> 4512.32
you're the one that's going to have to

4508.88 --> 4515.6
get the plan and have and hold and

4512.32 --> 4518.199
protect that plan and strategize for

4515.6 --> 4521.280000000001
that plan as you engage with the

4518.199 --> 4525.199
government so that they work for

4521.28 --> 4527.12
you with the plan

4525.199 --> 4529.32
you don't just go to the government and

4527.12 --> 4533.48
just do whatever they say they'll use

4529.32 --> 4533.48
you like a piece of meat and Eat You

4552.199 --> 4555.199
Alive

4564.239 --> 4569.5599999999995
yeah but Richard G the the reasoning

4566.4 --> 4572.92
behind that is you see what that

4569.56 --> 4575.080000000001
is I mean I completely understand why

4572.92 --> 4578.92
why it was that stupid that they did it

4575.08 --> 4581.32
you see Richard G why they did it is

4578.92 --> 4583.719
because that way they

4581.32 --> 4587.719
thought they magically

4583.719 --> 4590.12
thought I can just do exactly what was

4587.719 --> 4591.6
there and the whole point is is you

4590.12 --> 4594.08
don't think about you just go to the

4591.6 --> 4595.159000000001
ball game you just go to the dinner in a

4594.08 --> 4597.32
special

4595.159 --> 4600.719
restaurant you

4597.32 --> 4602.5199999999995
just and that's why they took it because

4600.719 --> 4604.44
they thought if they took it they could

4602.52 --> 4606.4800000000005
just get behind it and forget that it

4604.44 --> 4608.759999999999
even existed and just move on without

4606.48 --> 4612.08
anything that's why they did

4608.76 --> 4613.679
it they did it because they thought that

4612.08 --> 4615.44
nothing would happen

4613.679 --> 4617.12
and they could just get back to not

4615.44 --> 4618.919999999999
thinking about what the hell is going on

4617.12 --> 4620.08
in the world and just what they want to

4618.92 --> 4623.84
do in that

4620.08 --> 4627.4
moment so it makes perfect sense yeah

4623.84 --> 4629.1990000000005
people get themselves killed for very

4627.4 --> 4632.199
Petty

4629.199 --> 4635.28
things because they don't want to face

4632.199 --> 4637.44
the the reality of the danger of the

4635.28 --> 4640.32
predicament they that they found

4637.44 --> 4643.5599999999995
themselves in and that's why they do it

4640.32 --> 4645.88
for such Petty reasons is because they

4643.56 --> 4648.080000000001
can't face the dire

4645.88 --> 4650.84
situation and that's why the petty

4648.08 --> 4653.76
reasons get themselves

4650.84 --> 4657.2390000000005
killed cuz they're doubling down on like

4653.76 --> 4660.159000000001
I'm going to ignore this as a real thing

4657.239 --> 4662.879999999999
I'm going to magically think that I just

4660.159 --> 4665.5199999999995
go along with it I move past it nothing

4662.88 --> 4668.84
happens everything back to normal that's

4665.52 --> 4675.0
literally the [ __ ] mindset and it

4668.84 --> 4675.0
killed thousands not Millions

4675.76 --> 4680.719
there's no getting back to normal after

4678.199 --> 4680.719
this kind of

4697.8 --> 4704.92
thing what wow slowmo that's

4701.92 --> 4704.92
nuts

4725.76 --> 4731.88
but I mean this is like very

4729.239 --> 4734.12
comparable this entire jab situation

4731.88 --> 4737.679
what they could you you imagine that's

4734.12 --> 4741.96
like from one day to the other it's like

4737.679 --> 4741.96
okay cookies are now

4742.159 --> 4747.44
illegal like they are really really

4745.36 --> 4750.88
illegal if you get caught eating a

4747.44 --> 4752.638999999999
cookie like you can get jail time for 10

4750.88 --> 4754.679
years like unconditional if you're

4752.639 --> 4757.32
caught on camera eating a

4754.679 --> 4758.92
cookie or a police officer witnessed you

4757.32 --> 4760.799999999999
eating a cookie you go to jail

4758.92 --> 4762.32
immediately and like there's nothing you

4760.8 --> 4764.159000000001
can do about it because the entire

4762.32 --> 4767.12
system is in turmoil and there's

4764.159 --> 4771.4
literally nobody to even stand up to

4767.12 --> 4774.04
like protest in an official capacity to

4771.4 --> 4776.48
stop it so it's just that's there now

4774.04 --> 4778.159
yeah we got we got all the anti- cookie

4776.48 --> 4780.959999999999
propaganda in place

4778.159 --> 4783.4
too but then one

4780.96 --> 4785.6
day somebody comes along it's this

4783.4 --> 4788.36
amazing medical doctor he's like yeah we

4785.6 --> 4790.56
got the solution you see there was this

4788.36 --> 4792.839999999999
problem with the cookies before turned

4790.56 --> 4796.2390000000005
out they had a disastrous influence on

4792.84 --> 4799.679
on health but we got we fixed it we we

4796.239 --> 4801.48
changed the way we made the cookies and

4799.679 --> 4803.4400000000005
it has a special recipe though so you

4801.48 --> 4806.44
can't make this one at home you can only

4803.44 --> 4809.199
get it through our

4806.44 --> 4810.759999999999
Factory and then they res redistribute

4809.199 --> 4813.599999999999
the cookies and everybody's just eating

4810.76 --> 4816.0
the cookies and like oh yeah that's

4813.6 --> 4818.280000000001
cool but then over time they find

4816.0 --> 4821.719
themselves getting really

4818.28 --> 4824.719
sick from the cookies and like yeah

4821.719 --> 4826.96
we're not taking that cra

4824.719 --> 4829.76
so then they try to illegally bake

4826.96 --> 4831.92
cookies they get SWAT teed and all that

4829.76 --> 4834.320000000001
and it's a big

4831.92 --> 4838.6
disaster but in meantime the the new

4834.32 --> 4841.12
cookie man got enormous amounts of

4838.6 --> 4844.52
money hospitals got

4841.12 --> 4844.5199999999995
stimulated all of

4847.239 --> 4850.239
that

4850.8 --> 4855.8
it's people just like

4853.44 --> 4858.638999999999
oh this is a problem oh we get back to

4855.8 --> 4862.76
normal oh we just do this they just do

4858.639 --> 4864.56
whatever they say it's it's such a cheap

4862.76 --> 4866.320000000001
scam really how the government's even

4864.56 --> 4868.4400000000005
dealt with it it's like oh yeah we got

4866.32 --> 4871.48
to look everything down it's like oh if

4868.44 --> 4873.08
you want to bypass this thing you just

4871.48 --> 4875.839999999999
have to do this and it's not even money

4873.08 --> 4878.36
it's like it's not like okay if you just

4875.84 --> 4880.04
pay a 100 bucks then you can have a

4878.36 --> 4882.0
special pass and you can go out they

4880.04 --> 4884.199
could have made like a micro economy

4882.0 --> 4886.36
outside of lock down it's like yeah

4884.199 --> 4887.799999999999
everybody has a lockdown unless you have

4886.36 --> 4890.199
like a

4887.8 --> 4892.04
a100 pass and then you have like a

4890.199 --> 4894.08
certain radius in which you can walk

4892.04 --> 4896.199
outside they could have done that it

4894.08 --> 4899.5199999999995
would have been a whole micro economy

4896.199 --> 4901.5599999999995
all of a sudden of the rich mostly but

4899.52 --> 4902.8
they would have really enjoyed that it

4901.56 --> 4905.320000000001
would have

4902.8 --> 4908.4800000000005
actually countered some of the economic

4905.32 --> 4911.48
downfall that it brought the whole

4908.48 --> 4911.48
lockdowns

4911.639 --> 4915.56
right but they didn't do

4919.679 --> 4923.96
it okay I'm losing track of even what

4922.12 --> 4926.92
I'm talking what are you guys talking

4923.96 --> 4926.92
about the

4929.239 --> 4936.04
[ __ ] you can't watch Arwin without

4932.239 --> 4936.04
getting hungry I guess

4941.56 --> 4944.56
so

4946.12 --> 4951.639
don't see where the meat comes in

4948.84 --> 4953.52
though I mean that meat was an analogy

4951.639 --> 4957.400000000001
of you as a person and how you're going

4953.52 --> 4957.400000000001
to be regarded and treated and end

4958.239 --> 4964.799999999999
up I does that make you

4962.4 --> 4967.12
hungry when somebody tells you a

4964.8 --> 4968.639
metaphor of how you're going to become

4967.12 --> 4971.04
the piece of meat that's going to be

4968.639 --> 4973.76
eaten does that make you

4971.04 --> 4977.36
hungry buck up Hot

4973.76 --> 4977.360000000001
Buster that's a bit

4992.8 --> 5000.2390000000005
weird damn it taking yell

4996.88 --> 5002.88
sucks you like meat even if it's you

5000.239 --> 5006.32
that is the meat that is being eaten

5002.88 --> 5006.32
because that's what I was talking

5007.04 --> 5010.36
about you're

5014.88 --> 5020.6
weird hey getting sick see you yeah

5018.8 --> 5023.52
you're late but so was

5020.6 --> 5025.08
I damn it I'm through my coffee already

5023.52 --> 5028.52
this is

5025.08 --> 5028.5199999999995
inacceptable I want

5030.4 --> 5036.04
more yes I did talk about cookies it was

5033.639 --> 5036.04
another

5036.159 --> 5040.92
metaphor I was just saying like how

5038.44 --> 5043.638999999999
easily people are scammed I mean

5040.92 --> 5045.76
it's just

5043.639 --> 5048.4800000000005
oh

5045.76 --> 5050.52
lockdown oh but you can't like if you

5048.48 --> 5052.5199999999995
pay us this money and then you get this

5050.52 --> 5055.280000000001
special thing and then you have an

5052.52 --> 5058.040000000001
exemption I but I mean that level of

5055.28 --> 5061.599999999999
scam is just

5058.04 --> 5064.4
absurd that's like a cheap parlor trick

5061.6 --> 5067.76
scam AR this street

5064.4 --> 5071.5599999999995
guy but then on a government wide scale

5067.76 --> 5075.12
that's what happened it's so

5071.56 --> 5077.76
ridiculous so ridiculous that people

5075.12 --> 5077.76
fell for

5078.159 --> 5084.638999999999
it

5079.84 --> 5089.6
Like It embarrasses me more how many

5084.639 --> 5092.56
people fell into that than that it hurts

5089.6 --> 5094.8
me with exception of people that were

5092.56 --> 5096.88
just like really desperate to see their

5094.8 --> 5098.159000000001
family in their dying moment like that

5096.88 --> 5101.08
is just

5098.159 --> 5102.759999999999
cruel okay that was just cruel there's

5101.08 --> 5105.639
no excuse for

5102.76 --> 5108.08
that I mean that's like you torture

5105.639 --> 5110.159000000001
somebody say like oh if you just stopped

5108.08 --> 5113.44
if I just give you this vaccine I'll

5110.159 --> 5116.96
stop torturing you with this cattle prod

5113.44 --> 5120.32
and this knife then like that's not

5116.96 --> 5123.56
that's not fair that's just not fair man

5120.32 --> 5126.5199999999995
you can't like torture somebody and then

5123.56 --> 5130.119000000001
tell them I'll stop doing that if if you

5126.52 --> 5132.280000000001
take this J like that's too far people

5130.119 --> 5134.719
like oh I wanted to see the ball game

5132.28 --> 5137.96
yeah that's freaking on them that's just

5134.719 --> 5140.639
you being petty and

5137.96 --> 5142.8
ridiculous but not if you like you can't

5140.639 --> 5146.4800000000005
just say no you have to do that or you

5142.8 --> 5149.28
can't see your dying grandma that is

5146.48 --> 5152.28
inexcusable it is

5149.28 --> 5155.239
inexcusable in a way I'm very I feel

5152.28 --> 5158.48
feel lucky that my

5155.239 --> 5161.44
grandma's died before any of this

5158.48 --> 5164.0
happened and I was just able without

5161.44 --> 5166.5199999999995
hassle or mask or any nonsense to be

5164.0 --> 5166.52
there with

5168.199 --> 5174.4
them in the last like years in the last

5172.119 --> 5177.32
year that they would be there I did

5174.4 --> 5180.48
wasn't there when they died but like

5177.32 --> 5180.48
there was no hassle at

5181.199 --> 5184.199
least

5186.44 --> 5190.239
I can't imagine that people just

5191.08 --> 5196.239
like had like your lifelong bond with

5193.96 --> 5198.719
somebody and then like no you can't you

5196.239 --> 5202.44
can't see them unless you take the

5198.719 --> 5207.32
shot I it's so

5202.44 --> 5207.32
cruel that's just unforgivably

5211.199 --> 5214.199
cruel

5215.52 --> 5221.1990000000005
right so

5217.84 --> 5223.719
yeah there's that too yeah on one side

5221.199 --> 5225.28
absolute idiots for no damn reason doing

5223.719 --> 5228.32
that because they just don't want to

5225.28 --> 5232.599999999999
think about what's real the other one

5228.32 --> 5235.799999999999
totally inexcusable needs to be

5232.6 --> 5239.0
like the involved responsible need to be

5235.8 --> 5239.0
punished for

5240.639 --> 5245.719
that like it does doesn't matter if if

5243.92 --> 5249.36
they still

5245.719 --> 5250.88
legally you know legally had like oh

5249.36 --> 5254.96
yeah but we followed the rules or

5250.88 --> 5256.719
whatever no like that's like unnecessary

5254.96 --> 5259.92
mental

5256.719 --> 5262.2390000000005
torture that you put on those people and

5259.92 --> 5264.1990000000005
and they may have died because of

5262.239 --> 5268.638999999999
that

5264.199 --> 5268.638999999999
naturally like there's no excuse for

5270.04 --> 5277.639
that like you you break the

5274.44 --> 5281.239
basic system the

5277.639 --> 5281.2390000000005
basic legal

5281.32 --> 5286.48
Trap by doing that you can't like

5284.32 --> 5287.84
torture somebody into doing something

5286.48 --> 5290.839999999999
like

5287.84 --> 5292.159000000001
that they just have to be really Petty

5290.84 --> 5295.360000000001
and

5292.159 --> 5297.839999999999
dumb and like quailes just walk into the

5295.36 --> 5300.719
Trap because there's some seeds like

5297.84 --> 5303.76
that's the way it is that's the way it

5300.719 --> 5306.44
it is arguably acceptable in some

5303.76 --> 5308.719
mystical way it can work that way you

5306.44 --> 5311.0
can't torture people into doing that you

5308.719 --> 5311.0
just

5311.119 --> 5316.4
can't it's

5314.0 --> 5319.639
inacceptable like their spirits will

5316.4 --> 5319.638999999999
linger and

5325.679 --> 5330.8
torture yeah a fool that's fooled when

5328.84 --> 5333.119000000001
they die God will tell them like yeah

5330.8 --> 5338.320000000001
you were fooled and then they're like oh

5333.119 --> 5341.92
[ __ ] oh okay oh well right but you're

5338.32 --> 5343.759999999999
like I just wanted to see my grandma

5341.92 --> 5345.32
like yeah now there's a grievance now

5343.76 --> 5348.360000000001
there's a grievance after death that's

5345.32 --> 5352.28
going to linger that's going to

5348.36 --> 5352.28
influence like the

5353.0 --> 5357.639
karma of the spirits of of the

5360.92 --> 5363.92
people

5375.84 --> 5381.8
yeah CU I think that there there it

5378.76 --> 5385.04
sounds very metaphysical and might

5381.8 --> 5387.0
remind you but there is like after death

5385.04 --> 5389.639
Spirits can be in

5387.0 --> 5391.679
grievance and then they can't resolve it

5389.639 --> 5393.88
only what happens in the world can

5391.679 --> 5398.36
resolve resolve it it's like they have

5393.88 --> 5400.92
to they remain waiting until it

5398.36 --> 5403.36
stopped whatever their grievance was

5400.92 --> 5406.4
it's like it has to be corrected in the

5403.36 --> 5408.32
real in the still living world before

5406.4 --> 5410.36
they can move on I think that that sort

5408.32 --> 5414.5599999999995
of thing does

5410.36 --> 5417.759999999999
happen and if you like you're a young

5414.56 --> 5419.84
kid and you died because of a jab that

5417.76 --> 5422.08
you took because you had to see your

5419.84 --> 5424.08
grand dying Grandma who you had to

5422.08 --> 5426.88
really special connection with like

5424.08 --> 5429.32
that's a grievance in the

5426.88 --> 5432.679
afterlife that's

5429.32 --> 5437.36
like the ones responsible will have to

5432.679 --> 5437.36
pay for that or it's going to curse

5440.4 --> 5445.599999999999
everything and you don't know how far

5442.8 --> 5448.96
that curse will even stack I

5445.6 --> 5451.4800000000005
mean it might like really summon

5448.96 --> 5452.92
demons and those demons are not like oh

5451.48 --> 5454.678999999999
we're just going to eat everything now

5452.92 --> 5458.36
they're go those demons are like

5454.679 --> 5461.04
summoned then to go after the

5458.36 --> 5461.04
responsible

5461.52 --> 5466.2390000000005
ones they might turn everything crazy

5464.0 --> 5469.4
but only to take control of it to go

5466.239 --> 5469.4
after the responsible

5470.6 --> 5476.159000000001
ones like Injustice is very

5480.76 --> 5483.76
dangerous

5490.8 --> 5493.84
for coffee

5497.6 --> 5503.4800000000005
oh you buy what expensive coffee were

5500.56 --> 5503.4800000000005

slow-mo oh you're on the coffee

5513.84 --> 5516.84

5526.56 --> 5530.719
ad right now by the

5531.4 --> 5536.08
chat fine if you like that coffee that's

5540.679 --> 5543.679

5632.28 --> 5638.48
never really liked it though it more

5635.32 --> 5640.4
appealed to me because it was so welln

5638.48 --> 5643.678999999999
and that you could like reference it and

5640.4 --> 5645.5599999999995
be popular but actually watching it I

5643.679 --> 5648.1990000000005
never really thought it was that great

5645.56 --> 5650.280000000001
and the every time I watch it again I'm

5648.199 --> 5654.08

6013.4 --> 6018.5199999999995
should be nothing stopping him from

6015.599 --> 6022.96
literally going to Skype and just saying

6018.52 --> 6022.96
hey that was me and then I'll unban

6026.28 --> 6031.36
him but it's not happening so I don't

6028.8 --> 6031.360000000001
think it was

6049.92 --> 6052.92
him

6072.44 --> 6076.48
friend that was into zombie movies and

6074.679 --> 6079.8
he turned into a

6076.48 --> 6079.799999999999
zombie that's

6079.84 --> 6084.159000000001
gross

6082.199 --> 6087.159
slow my moon

6084.159 --> 6087.159
Bucky

6109.84 --> 6112.84
weird

6139.76 --> 6142.76
for

6160.84 --> 6165.679
okay is this where everybody just leaves

6163.679 --> 6168.159
is this the end of the

6165.679 --> 6169.76
show no somebody's still going to say

6168.159 --> 6172.759999999999
something

6169.76 --> 6172.76
okay

6174.159 --> 6179.04
if you believe in B Earth at in because

6176.28 --> 6182.119
of experimental injections

6179.04 --> 6185.199
well who's to say Jenna

6182.119 --> 6189.88
Massie I

6185.199 --> 6192.04
mean the ball is like a suggestion the

6189.88 --> 6194.2390000000005
suggestion the way to look at it like

6192.04 --> 6197.48
that might be harder to resist and

6194.239 --> 6200.239
bypass to see how it actually is if you

6197.48 --> 6202.678999999999
have like burdens or even direct brain

6200.239 --> 6205.598999999999
damage

6202.679 --> 6209.2390000000005
because of the experimental injection so

6205.599 --> 6211.4800000000005
it might literally like yeah it's a ball

6209.239 --> 6213.159
because you it's too difficult to think

6211.48 --> 6215.799999999999
of it in any other

6213.159 --> 6218.0
way so there might actually be something

6215.8 --> 6218.0
to

6220.08 --> 6227.48
it I

6222.8 --> 6230.719
mean the ball religion is like a dumbass

6227.48 --> 6234.159
religion that's why very dumb people

6230.719 --> 6238.08
even [ __ ] people that still have

6234.159 --> 6240.5199999999995
some just normal personality traits

6238.08 --> 6242.0
that's why all the retards believe in a

6240.52 --> 6245.280000000001
globe

6242.0 --> 6248.679
typically like traditionally as in like

6245.28 --> 6248.679
in the '90s and

6249.119 --> 6255.4
80s people that will be like mentally

6252.639 --> 6258.76
handicapped but could still talk and all

6255.4 --> 6261.96
that they would love the globe Earth and

6258.76 --> 6265.1990000000005
the pictures of space on the

6261.96 --> 6267.36
television yeah why do you think that is

6265.199 --> 6270.799999999999
it's not because all the Earth being a

6267.36 --> 6273.04
globe is incredibly difficult so tough

6270.8 --> 6275.52
on the Mind man it's like no it's

6273.04 --> 6280.679
actually really

6275.52 --> 6280.679
easy it's such an easy way to look at

6281.04 --> 6286.159
it it's easy to keep in your mind

6286.44 --> 6291.239
comparatively to getting real and like

6289.4 --> 6294.08
how does it actually work what are we

6291.239 --> 6296.598999999999
actually seeing right that takes more

6294.08 --> 6299.36
effort more analysis more

6296.599 --> 6301.1990000000005
clarity if you're like very stuffy on

6299.36 --> 6303.36
the inside or you're just not very good

6301.199 --> 6306.879999999999
at making

6303.36 --> 6309.598999999999
complicated reasoning then the globe is

6306.88 --> 6312.36
going to be like the default that's the

6309.599 --> 6318.1990000000005
only place to go to for

6312.36 --> 6318.199
you the globe is a [ __ ]

6318.92 --> 6325.36
religion and that's not

6322.08 --> 6331.239
slander that's provable

6325.36 --> 6331.239
fact it is a religion for the

6331.84 --> 6341.84
[ __ ] to give an in or little

6336.239 --> 6344.48
children an inkling of insight on the

6341.84 --> 6349.4800000000005
whole that is

6344.48 --> 6353.36
still manageable for those with lesser

6349.48 --> 6357.239
sensories lesser faculties it's

6353.36 --> 6361.92
literally the [ __ ] religion and that's

6357.239 --> 6364.4
okay yeah don't freaking bother a bunch

6361.92 --> 6366.96
of handicapp people that mind their own

6364.4 --> 6369.08
damn business tell them the Earth is

6366.96 --> 6372.599
flat the Earth is flat like don't do

6369.08 --> 6375.48
that yeah leave them alone hey if they

6372.599 --> 6377.360000000001
freaking asses like Sean Hawkins and all

6375.48 --> 6380.08
that who's like provably mentally

6377.36 --> 6382.639
handicapped and they go to flat earthers

6380.08 --> 6385.92
and say stupid things like why do the

6382.639 --> 6388.8
stars rotate the other way around in the

6385.92 --> 6392.0
South yeah that's on them they're the

6388.8 --> 6394.08
ones engaging yeah if it's just some

6392.0 --> 6396.639
handicap guy out

6394.08 --> 6399.5199999999995
there who likes to take

6396.639 --> 6402.8
walks with the group or whatever don't

6399.52 --> 6407.4800000000005
Knack them about Flat

6402.8 --> 6411.599
Earth yeah it might really hurt them

6407.48 --> 6414.44
because it's really it's too complicated

6411.599 --> 6417.88
they'll just say it's a globe it's a

6414.44 --> 6421.239
globe leave me alone it's a globe don't

6417.88 --> 6424.04
leave him alone don't nag him about

6421.239 --> 6427.08
that if they come to you that's another

6424.04 --> 6429.8
matter let's just be honest try to

6427.08 --> 6432.5199999999995
explain it they might not remember it

6429.8 --> 6434.4400000000005
but they will get a sniff of it they

6432.52 --> 6436.1990000000005
will get a sniff of that reality might

6434.44 --> 6438.32
be more complicated that might be out of

6436.199 --> 6442.159
their hands but then they at least have

6438.32 --> 6443.679
a sniff of no there's something more

6442.159 --> 6447.119
but don't nag

6443.679 --> 6448.84
him because the globe is there for the

6447.119 --> 6451.119
mentally

6448.84 --> 6454.04
handicap that's what it's suitable for

6451.119 --> 6456.5199999999995
that's why it's the slave religion too

6454.04 --> 6458.639
because yeah in interest of slavery

6456.52 --> 6460.4800000000005
everybody has to be dumb well what the

6458.639 --> 6462.76
hell do they believe when they're dumb

6460.48 --> 6464.28
well nothing they're just animals well

6462.76 --> 6465.92
that's not good for cohesion they're

6464.28 --> 6469.679
just going to try to dominate each other

6465.92 --> 6472.599
and and all that so what do you do a

6469.679 --> 6474.4400000000005
very simp simple Universal dream

6472.599 --> 6478.400000000001
religion the

6474.44 --> 6481.4
globe the reality is weird and now we

6478.4 --> 6484.28
can tell all these stories about places

6481.4 --> 6485.719
beyond their reach that fit in this

6484.28 --> 6487.599
world

6485.719 --> 6490.119
view great

6487.599 --> 6492.2390000000005
entertainment and entertainment about

6490.119 --> 6494.5599999999995
like futuristic things that will make

6492.239 --> 6496.159
the participant the one that believes it

6494.56 --> 6498.639
feel very

6496.159 --> 6502.119
smart even though they are [ __ ] so

6498.639 --> 6507.2390000000005
it's like the glob religion is there

6502.119 --> 6510.4
to make dumb people think they're really

6507.239 --> 6514.04
smart for being part of it it's part of

6510.4 --> 6518.598999999999
the magic trick it's like really cruel

6514.04 --> 6521.44
that it's like yeah really dumb

6518.599 --> 6523.719
people in by believing in it they feel

6521.44 --> 6526.48
smarter about themselves it's really

6523.719 --> 6529.639
cruel in that sense but I mean it is

6526.48 --> 6531.5599999999995
what it is it works that way it's a trap

6529.639 --> 6533.119
if you're trapped it is very hard to get

6531.56 --> 6537.080000000001
out

6533.119 --> 6540.36
because to get out you have to let

6537.08 --> 6543.639
go of the thing in the bottle that you

6540.36 --> 6545.159
tried to grab you have to let it go and

6543.639 --> 6546.76
people don't want to let it they want to

6545.159 --> 6549.638999999999
they want to feel

6546.76 --> 6551.96
smarter I want to feel smarter I'm not

6549.639 --> 6556.639
dumb well then let it

6551.96 --> 6556.639
go let it go just be what you

6557.679 --> 6562.119
are oh that's too tough for some

6568.56 --> 6573.080000000001
it's freaking magical what they've done

6570.08 --> 6576.159
yeah no it is complicated psychology and

6573.08 --> 6579.44
it is it is mind control that has

6576.159 --> 6581.679
stemmed out of like Priestly

6579.44 --> 6584.719
research and with Priestly I not

6581.679 --> 6585.8
necessarily mean Christian type Priestly

6584.719 --> 6588.639
but

6585.8 --> 6591.2390000000005
Priestly mind control research for like

6588.639 --> 6594.04
thousands of years

6591.239 --> 6595.879999999999
this is what they found out this is

6594.04 --> 6598.44
where the glob religion comes from it's

6595.88 --> 6600.32
it's a mind control view it's like you

6598.44 --> 6601.919999999999
have to have everybody dumb take away

6600.32 --> 6604.5599999999995
all their information attack the ones

6601.92 --> 6607.84
that get it and that resist

6604.56 --> 6610.400000000001
delusion but what do they then believe

6607.84 --> 6613.1990000000005
it'll go wild if there's nobody with a

6610.4 --> 6614.598999999999
consistency there and we all remove them

6613.199 --> 6617.32
because they saw through our mind

6614.599 --> 6620.28
control well then give them a reversed

6617.32 --> 6622.199
world religion like they'll never get

6620.28 --> 6624.28
anywhere but they'll have something to

6622.199 --> 6627.719
believe

6624.28 --> 6630.759999999999
in a false mind control

6627.719 --> 6633.679
religion that's easy to grasp on to for

6630.76 --> 6637.76
the dumb and makes them feel really

6633.679 --> 6637.76
smart for being able to get

6640.05 --> 6643.079000000001
[Music]

6649.04 --> 6652.04
it

6658.8 --> 6665.320000000001
right hope you're enjoying this I've

6662.079 --> 6665.32
been saying some good

6665.719 --> 6670.36
things like this is a show that I'm

6667.719 --> 6670.36
going to watch

6670.719 --> 6678.8
back right if you like it too then yeah

6674.8 --> 6681.84
donate can always use the support really

6678.8 --> 6684.159000000001
still right and hey you want me to go

6681.84 --> 6684.159000000001
back to

6684.52 --> 6692.159000000001
Fed then donate to my gifts and go

6689.8 --> 6694.4400000000005
there's been more people

6692.159 --> 6696.4
donating but it seems like it's now like

6694.44 --> 6699.598999999999
a sort of a running joke

6696.4 --> 6703.04
almost there's more weird donations in

6699.599 --> 6705.719
there but hey it is what it is

6703.04 --> 6708.96
man if you think like oh man this is

6705.719 --> 6713.56
this opportunity to

6708.96 --> 6717.8
just have really funny silly

6713.56 --> 6720.8
messages in AR win's gifts and

6717.8 --> 6720.8
go

6723.639 --> 6727.52
okay do that by all

6729.719 --> 6735.119
means all right by the way there was

6732.04 --> 6737.96
yesterday a bit of an event on fed

6735.119 --> 6742.839999999999
too I watched it afterward because it

6737.96 --> 6747.0
was during my show but yeah sleeping

6742.84 --> 6751.4400000000005
Warrior getting on there and being very

6747.0 --> 6754.639
weird being ex being as bad as a baller

6751.44 --> 6758.5199999999995
being as bad as rumpus I mean he spent

6754.639 --> 6761.36
like two3 of the time just whining about

6758.52 --> 6763.88
not being able to finish a sentence and

6761.36 --> 6765.44
and like really crying about it almost

6763.88 --> 6767.96
was quite

6765.44 --> 6770.36
pathetic and the overall technical point

6767.96 --> 6773.52
he was making was ridiculous

6770.36 --> 6773.5199999999995
it was like a Bev

6774.679 --> 6781.639
point that thing was

6777.8 --> 6781.639
ridiculous holy [ __ ]

6782.239 --> 6789.718999999999
man so yeah that happened that was weird

6786.88 --> 6793.36
it got a lot of views though I guess

6789.719 --> 6796.4800000000005
everybody's like Oh yay more old friends

6793.36 --> 6799.0
fighting oh will they kill each other

6796.48 --> 6800.28
will they please just freaking murder

6799.0 --> 6802.159
each other yeah

6800.28 --> 6806.0
it could all go away and we can think

6802.159 --> 6808.5199999999995
it's a globe again because we're [ __ ]

6806.0 --> 6812.76
[ __ ] we can't think for ourselves

6808.52 --> 6816.4800000000005
anymore so the people that make us hurt

6812.76 --> 6819.280000000001
we just want them to die somehow so we

6816.48 --> 6820.839999999999
can just feel like we're in control of

6819.28 --> 6825.5199999999995
ourselves again because we're too

6820.84 --> 6825.52
[ __ ] to move on to anything

6828.76 --> 6831.76
sensible

6847.599 --> 6854.88
really that Natural Science doesn't

6851.04 --> 6857.36
adhere to the sphere

6854.88 --> 6860.56
what

6857.36 --> 6862.839999999999
no the Natural Science has nothing to do

6860.56 --> 6866.52
with the

6862.84 --> 6870.599
sphere the sphere is a geometric

6866.52 --> 6874.119000000001
matter and it's the sphere that doesn't

6870.599 --> 6875.2390000000005
adhere to Natural Science in fact

6874.119 --> 6878.28
there's

6875.239 --> 6882.28
claims within the heliocentric

6878.28 --> 6884.44
cosmology that defy natural law natural

6882.28 --> 6886.4
law isn't Natural Science though it's

6884.44 --> 6892.32
natural

6886.4 --> 6892.32
law so the sphere defies natural

6893.119 --> 6900.36
law but that's not the shape of it that

6896.28 --> 6903.44
does it it's the the claim of the

6900.36 --> 6905.4
universe and what it is versus how we're

6903.44 --> 6907.36
breathing down here that's the thing

6905.4 --> 6910.04
that violates natural law the shape of

6907.36 --> 6913.799999999999
the earth that's a geometric matter has

6910.04 --> 6913.8
nothing to do with natural law or

6918.599 --> 6924.1990000000005
science

6920.119 --> 6924.199
I'm not understanding you

6938.119 --> 6945.079
okay yeah well there is no such thing

6941.96 --> 6947.159
what what natural science is violated

6945.079 --> 6951.599
jassi can I have the independent

6947.159 --> 6951.598999999999
variable on that specifically

6960.8 --> 6968.0
you don't have much room to type it out

6962.88 --> 6970.8
there well you have plenty of

6968.0 --> 6974.48
room 200 characters is a

6970.8 --> 6976.76
lot and you could start by just not say

6974.48 --> 6978.5199999999995
putting certain words together that

6976.76 --> 6981.52
don't belong

6978.52 --> 6981.52
together

6984.639 --> 6990.639
CL Earth defies

6988.079 --> 6992.92
magnetism

6990.639 --> 6994.88
okay defies

6992.92 --> 6999.36
entropy

6994.88 --> 6999.36
yes gas pressure laws to be

7001.239 --> 7008.598999999999
specific natural law entropy gas

7004.96 --> 7010.079
pressure based yeah that's what it does

7008.599 --> 7013.0
don't know what magnet isn't have

7010.079 --> 7013.0
anything to do with it

7013.639 --> 7020.52
though but natural that's natural law

7017.28 --> 7022.719
yeah entropy is natural laws not natural

7020.52 --> 7026.719
science science is a

7022.719 --> 7029.04
method it is the cause of an effect that

7026.719 --> 7030.8
is being established through

7029.04 --> 7032.88
experimentation by varying and

7030.8 --> 7036.079000000001
manipulating the independent variable

7032.88 --> 7038.400000000001
that is presumed to be the cause of the

7036.079 --> 7041.4
effect that you're trying to

7038.4 --> 7041.4
study

7046.48 --> 7051.598999999999
right something being what it is is not

7050.0 --> 7054.32
the natural

7051.599 --> 7056.4400000000005
phenomenon so and you're not verying

7054.32 --> 7059.679
manipulating it either so it's not

7056.44 --> 7062.5199999999995
Natural Science natural law is not the

7059.679 --> 7064.76
same thing as Natural Science natural

7062.52 --> 7068.639
law is

7064.76 --> 7070.4800000000005
always something what what is always is

7068.639 --> 7075.0
natural law

7070.48 --> 7078.04
natural science is the cause of an

7075.0 --> 7081.44
effect that can be

7078.04 --> 7083.88
falsified by proving or disproving the

7081.44 --> 7086.0
independent variable which is the cause

7083.88 --> 7088.56
of the presumed

7086.0 --> 7091.159
effect it's a very specific set of

7088.56 --> 7094.159000000001
actions that require physical

7091.159 --> 7096.44
interaction and a naturally occurring

7094.159 --> 7098.48
phenomenon if there's no

7096.44 --> 7101.32
interaction then it's not Natural

7098.48 --> 7101.32
Science

7106.119 --> 7114.239
there are laws inside no no Jenna

7111.239 --> 7114.239
Massie

7114.679 --> 7122.599
no this is colloquial hor

7118.0 --> 7128.159
[ __ ] this is not physics

7122.599 --> 7128.159000000001
correct this will get you like a a D+ at

7128.32 --> 7131.32
best

7131.96 --> 7138.04
D minus rather like this is not going to

7134.079 --> 7141.079
get you an a you're wrong Jenna Massie

7138.04 --> 7144.04
but I said it's very specific it's

7141.079 --> 7146.5199999999995
correct I'll probably get like an an A

7144.04 --> 7149.36
minus or something for

7146.52 --> 7152.84
that what you're saying is

7149.36 --> 7155.119
incorrect it's a a very colloquial way

7152.84 --> 7158.2390000000005
of thinking about it it's how I thought

7155.119 --> 7160.36
of it all too when I was

7158.239 --> 7162.28
10

7160.36 --> 7164.32
but it's technically incorrect it just

7162.28 --> 7166.84
doesn't really matter when you're 10 to

7164.32 --> 7168.719
be that correct about it all it's just

7166.84 --> 7171.88
very easy to think colloquially about it

7168.719 --> 7174.119
all and just mash it up in one big soup

7171.88 --> 7176.159000000001
it kind of fits together yeah but the

7174.119 --> 7177.5599999999995
real thing the real natural science the

7176.159 --> 7181.36
real scientific

7177.56 --> 7184.4800000000005
method the real laws of nature they're

7181.36 --> 7190.199
all hyper

7184.48 --> 7193.04
specific they must be hyper specific

7190.199 --> 7196.199
spe if it's not hyp

7193.04 --> 7199.639
specific you enter the realm of pseudo

7196.199 --> 7204.598999999999
science it's very easy to do that and

7199.639 --> 7206.36
it's very prevalent within common

7204.599 --> 7211.32
culture

7206.36 --> 7215.04
now thanks to Media blabbering a lot

7211.32 --> 7215.04
with pseudoscience

7218.159 --> 7221.159
nonsense

7231.199 --> 7234.48
natural that's not Natural Science

7232.8 --> 7237.639
that's natural

7234.48 --> 7240.48
law law and science is not the same

7237.639 --> 7243.599
thing stop mixing up the words you're do

7240.48 --> 7246.879999999999
you're doing it wrong stop

7243.599 --> 7251.119000000001
it stop exerting your colloquialism

7246.88 --> 7251.119
you're incorrect get it right

7256.28 --> 7261.5199999999995
okay duper I'm glad that helped I mean

7258.28 --> 7264.4
this Q's drilled this into people's

7261.52 --> 7269.360000000001
heads for no to no end it's very

7264.4 --> 7272.92
annoying but it's also very very correct

7269.36 --> 7275.199
and it is the real

7272.92 --> 7277.079
standard problem is most people out

7275.199 --> 7278.598999999999
there just don't really like to work on

7277.079 --> 7281.079
the really is level and they like to

7278.599 --> 7284.76
keep it colloquial and then you end up

7281.079 --> 7287.079
with weird hybridized thinking that is

7284.76 --> 7289.639
incorrect and if you'd formulate

7287.079 --> 7293.32
something like that like on

7289.639 --> 7299.119
University you don't get an A you get

7293.32 --> 7299.119
like a D minus at best if not just an

7300.76 --> 7304.96
F what is physical

7305.52 --> 7311.040000000001
science physical science you mean

7308.44 --> 7311.04
physics

7322.159 --> 7329.638999999999
that's the establishment of nature like

7325.48 --> 7334.199
causes of effects naturally occurring

7329.639 --> 7337.28
phenomenon and the empirical method

7334.199 --> 7340.0
interaction to prove or disprove the

7337.28 --> 7344.159
cause of an effect

7340.0 --> 7344.159
that is science very

7344.639 --> 7349.28
specifically

7347.599 --> 7351.88
like

7349.28 --> 7354.599
physical the process within science

7351.88 --> 7357.679
doesn't even have to be physical

7354.599 --> 7360.28
necessarily it just has to be something

7357.679 --> 7364.88
that you can provably manipulate in

7360.28 --> 7367.96
order to establish whether that provably

7364.88 --> 7370.1990000000005
causes a a

7367.96 --> 7372.56
change in the

7370.199 --> 7375.719
phenomenon to

7372.56 --> 7378.8
prove that

7375.719 --> 7380.32
manipulating the independent variable

7378.8 --> 7383.079000000001
causes that

7380.32 --> 7385.199
effect then it becomes Natural Science

7383.079 --> 7387.4
yeah it doesn't have to be something

7385.199 --> 7389.5599999999995
physical it can

7387.4 --> 7392.48
be the

7389.56 --> 7396.96
accessibility to the

7392.48 --> 7400.879999999999
information that knows the path through

7396.96 --> 7400.88
which a particle has

7401.719 --> 7407.92
gone that very entire description can be

7406.159 --> 7412.04
the independent variable that you very

7407.92 --> 7412.04
manipulate in order to change the

7413.599 --> 7419.28
outcome cause the effect the collapse of

7416.84 --> 7423.28
defraction

7419.28 --> 7426.32
cascade by having act by being able to

7423.28 --> 7427.88
access the information that tells you

7426.32 --> 7430.88
which path it

7427.88 --> 7430.88
took

7431.32 --> 7436.159
yeah that's not a physical thing that's

7433.28 --> 7438.84
information information is absolutely

7436.159 --> 7441.48
not an ever will be

7438.84 --> 7444.04
physical but you're still

7441.48 --> 7447.4
having to vary and manipulate an

7444.04 --> 7451.44
independent variable and then cause a

7447.4 --> 7456.48
physical different end result a physical

7451.44 --> 7459.799999999999
effect is manifested by manipulating

7456.48 --> 7461.199
informational independent variable

7459.8 --> 7463.1990000000005
yeah so it doesn't have to be

7461.199 --> 7466.199
exclusively

7463.199 --> 7468.879999999999
physical although what typically is a

7466.199 --> 7472.719
standard within science is that the end

7468.88 --> 7473.84
result must be a physical change yeah

7472.719 --> 7476.44
you can

7473.84 --> 7480.2390000000005
scientifically prove that you can

7476.44 --> 7482.638999999999
consistently change somebody's

7480.239 --> 7484.36
mind by varying and manipulating

7482.639 --> 7485.559
something that doesn't work because the

7484.36 --> 7489.32
mind can just

7485.559 --> 7493.04
change independently you can't control

7489.32 --> 7495.759999999999
it you literally are incapable to even

7493.04 --> 7497.679
check if you are effectively controlling

7495.76 --> 7500.52
the

7497.679 --> 7503.4400000000005
mind you can only notice it afterward

7500.52 --> 7506.079000000001
and then roughly derive whether you did

7503.44 --> 7508.28
based on what is being

7506.079 --> 7511.079
done right this is not an accurate

7508.28 --> 7513.599
science and can never be but you can

7511.079 --> 7515.96
very manipulate information based

7513.599 --> 7517.2390000000005
independent variables and if that causes

7515.96 --> 7519.599
a

7517.239 --> 7522.239
physical change

7519.599 --> 7524.4400000000005
then it is physics even though the

7522.239 --> 7528.0
independent variable itself was not a

7524.44 --> 7528.0
physical thing it was

7529.56 --> 7534.04
[Music]

7531.199 --> 7535.4
information what are the valid methods

7534.04 --> 7538.04
to

7535.4 --> 7541.5199999999995
know that's a that entire line of

7538.04 --> 7541.5199999999995
questioning is

7546.76 --> 7550.4400000000005
incorrect valid methods to to manipulate

7549.28 --> 7552.92
the independent

7550.44 --> 7555.4
variable that's the whole

7552.92 --> 7556.96
point you got to First figure out what

7555.4 --> 7559.5199999999995
is the independent

7556.96 --> 7562.639
variable and then can you manipulate it

7559.52 --> 7566.52
all depends on what it is and if there

7562.639 --> 7570.0
is a hint to that it will actually cause

7566.52 --> 7572.280000000001
something right can just conspire to

7570.0 --> 7573.639
manipulate whatever but if it doesn't

7572.28 --> 7575.599
cause anything it's still not going to

7573.639 --> 7579.0
be science it's just going to you try to

7575.599 --> 7582.76
attempt to see if manipulating something

7579.0 --> 7582.76
something else and then it doesn't do

7590.719 --> 7595.92
that does the independent variable need

7593.599 --> 7598.559
to change after you determine

7595.92 --> 7604.2390000000005
it

7598.559 --> 7606.639
no you must change it and then the

7604.239 --> 7610.48
outcome should be altered and if it

7606.639 --> 7612.88
isn't altered then the null

7610.48 --> 7612.879999999999
is the

7614.599 --> 7618.52
outcome you don't change the thing that

7617.159 --> 7620.638999999999
you're varying and manipulating the

7618.52 --> 7623.679
varying manipulating

7620.639 --> 7626.400000000001
is the action you

7623.679 --> 7629.639
do in order to determine that the

7626.4 --> 7632.159
outcome is changed or not

7629.639 --> 7635.679
changed that the

7632.159 --> 7638.119
effect is caused or not

7635.679 --> 7640.52
caused through the manipulation of the

7638.119 --> 7640.5199999999995
independent

7642.559 --> 7646.159000000001
variable so there's the independent

7644.84 --> 7649.599
variable the

7646.159 --> 7652.32
thing that you can

7649.599 --> 7654.679
manipulate and then there is the end

7652.32 --> 7656.92
result which is the thing that you think

7654.679 --> 7656.92
that

7657.239 --> 7661.04
manipulating the independent variable

7659.36 --> 7663.598999999999
will

7661.04 --> 7665.96
cause does it cause that does it not

7663.599 --> 7667.96
cause that well you'll find out by doing

7665.96 --> 7669.199
it by manipulating that independent

7667.96 --> 7671.639
variable

7669.199 --> 7673.28
and then you know did it cause it did it

7671.639 --> 7675.079
not cause it if it did cause it guess

7673.28 --> 7677.599
what you got a scientific experiment to

7675.079 --> 7679.759999999999
prove the cause of the effect it didn't

7677.599 --> 7682.84
cause it oh damn it oh then you got the

7679.76 --> 7686.4400000000005
null hypothesis it didn't cause the

7682.84 --> 7687.559
effect then you still got a a result

7686.44 --> 7689.919999999999
still

7687.559 --> 7693.2390000000005
scientific it's just not going to lead

7689.92 --> 7696.0
to a progress of understanding but you

7693.239 --> 7697.44
definitely prove that it didn't cause it

7696.0 --> 7701.599
there's always going to be a

7697.44 --> 7701.598999999999
result in a scientific

7706.88 --> 7713.119
experiment right but what actions you're

7710.639 --> 7714.76
going to take to manipulate the inant

7713.119 --> 7718.119
variable it all depends on what it is

7714.76 --> 7720.96
that you're trying to prove there is no

7718.119 --> 7725.199
Universal set of things that you can do

7720.96 --> 7725.199
to manipulate the independent variable

7727.0 --> 7731.159
because just what could be an

7729.239 --> 7734.28
independent variable like figuring that

7731.159 --> 7737.079
out what can be manipulated in order to

7734.28 --> 7740.599
do something yeah well what

7737.079 --> 7744.28
can't and then it's like yeah everything

7740.599 --> 7746.719
and a lot of not everything a lot of

7744.28 --> 7750.159
things that are completely wildly

7746.719 --> 7752.96
different and no correlations whatsoever

7750.159 --> 7756.079
yeah a lot of things can be very to

7752.96 --> 7758.119
manipulated and the most of them won't

7756.079 --> 7759.84
cause anything and some of them will

7758.119 --> 7762.28
cause

7759.84 --> 7764.88
things but you can't just generalize

7762.28 --> 7767.84
that clammy it doesn't work like

7764.88 --> 7770.28
that hope that clarifies a bit a damn it

7767.84 --> 7770.28
Sun's

7771.52 --> 7775.719
gone it's getting dark out

7775.96 --> 7780.32
here please name some

7784.0 --> 7790.88
no not all methods no there is no

7787.84 --> 7794.559
methods there's only one method it's the

7790.88 --> 7797.92
scientific method one method many

7794.559 --> 7800.96
applications there's one method one

7797.92 --> 7805.119
method the method the scientific method

7800.96 --> 7809.159
one method no methods one

7805.119 --> 7811.36
method it's one method every time now

7809.159 --> 7813.799999999999
how you going to fill in that method

7811.36 --> 7813.799999999999
with the

7813.84 --> 7819.4400000000005
actions and the and the

7816.559 --> 7821.76
variables and the result that you think

7819.44 --> 7825.759999999999
it might have that's another matter but

7821.76 --> 7825.76
there's one method for it there's no

7831.639 --> 7838.599
methods right want this a scientific

7835.599 --> 7838.599
description

7841.0 --> 7847.119
sure

7843.52 --> 7851.119000000001
continually inserting heat in water

7847.119 --> 7854.799999999999
causes water to to boil

7851.119 --> 7858.28
eventually that's a scientific

7854.8 --> 7860.719
statement you introduce heat not a

7858.28 --> 7862.84
little bit and then stop but you keep

7860.719 --> 7865.079
introducing heat eventually the water's

7862.84 --> 7865.079
going to

7867.159 --> 7874.679
boil that's scientific at no point do

7872.079 --> 7877.48
you introduce heat to

7874.679 --> 7880.159
water and it will not eventually boil

7877.48 --> 7880.159
when you keep doing

7880.199 --> 7885.04
that there's no scenario in which that

7883.28 --> 7889.44
won't

7885.04 --> 7892.119
happen meaning that yes heat always

7889.44 --> 7895.0
causes water to

7892.119 --> 7898.199
boil

7895.0 --> 7900.239
eventually like the the number or the

7898.199 --> 7904.4
amount or a length of time is not

7900.239 --> 7906.919999999999
relevant to that there's it's just heat

7904.4 --> 7906.92
does

7907.159 --> 7912.759999999999
that

7908.8 --> 7917.1990000000005
you put a kettle on a gas fire the water

7912.76 --> 7920.88
is going to cook there is no

7917.199 --> 7922.28
point in no circumstance where the fire

7920.88 --> 7927.0
can

7922.28 --> 7931.48
burn is that heat not going to lead to

7927.0 --> 7931.48
the water boiling it always does

7931.52 --> 7940.400000000001
it thus heat boils

7936.36 --> 7940.4
water is a scien ific

7953.079 --> 7959.079
statement so yeah that's a very basic

7955.48 --> 7959.079
one I mean it's not

7967.04 --> 7970.04
new

7973.04 --> 7978.04
could do the same with gas pressure

7975.44 --> 7981.799999999999
requiring a

7978.04 --> 7984.48
containment no no you

7981.8 --> 7987.52
can't because you can't take away the

7984.48 --> 7987.5199999999995
containment Richard

7988.159 --> 7993.638999999999
G you can't have gas pressure without a

7991.719 --> 7996.96
containment because there's no way to

7993.639 --> 7999.96
test it we are contained we do have gas

7996.96 --> 7999.96
pressure

8000.28 --> 8004.44
you can't take away the containment in

8002.199 --> 8006.28
order to test if it works without

8004.44 --> 8008.04
containment because it is contained

8006.28 --> 8011.559
because we have gas

8008.04 --> 8012.48
pressure I mean you might try to emulate

8011.559 --> 8015.76
a

8012.48 --> 8018.638999999999
vacuum a super low pressure and how do

8015.76 --> 8022.92
you do that by

8018.639 --> 8025.8
creating guess what a container to do

8022.92 --> 8028.719
that and then you could

8025.8 --> 8030.96
emulate what it's like in a virtual

8028.719 --> 8033.52
scenario of imagining like it's not

8030.96 --> 8035.84
contained that would logically create a

8033.52 --> 8038.0
vacuum even though you don't know that

8035.84 --> 8040.88
because you never tested it what if

8038.0 --> 8043.719
there was no container at all and then

8040.88 --> 8046.28
gas behavior just didn't behave anymore

8043.719 --> 8048.32
it's just like okay well if there's

8046.28 --> 8049.92
infinite if there's literally no

8048.32 --> 8051.719
containment but then we're just not

8049.92 --> 8055.8
going to

8051.719 --> 8059.84
press who knows because we can't test it

8055.8 --> 8062.159000000001
we can only test gas

8059.84 --> 8065.2390000000005
from the perspective of having

8062.159 --> 8067.719
containment because we can't not have

8065.239 --> 8069.04
containment in order to test if gas

8067.719 --> 8070.96
pressure still works without a

8069.04 --> 8073.36
containment we can't escape the

8070.96 --> 8075.199
containment there is always containment

8073.36 --> 8077.598999999999
how do we know that there's gas pressure

8075.199 --> 8079.44
yeah it is kind of a vicious circle but

8077.599 --> 8082.400000000001
you can't get out of that Vicious Circle

8079.44 --> 8084.5199999999995
there's no way to get out you can get

8082.4 --> 8087.04
out of the containment in order to test

8084.52 --> 8089.52
whether gas pressure would put what it

8087.04 --> 8092.48
would do what gas would do if it didn't

8089.52 --> 8093.96
have containment we can't test it

8092.48 --> 8097.4
because there is containment because we

8093.96 --> 8099.76
got gas pressure gas pressure is

8097.4 --> 8102.36
defined and

8099.76 --> 8105.079000000001
calculated having a

8102.36 --> 8107.5199999999995
container we can't calculate gas

8105.079 --> 8109.84
pressure without a

8107.52 --> 8113.679
container without a container we

8109.84 --> 8117.159000000001
wouldn't have a concept of gas

8113.679 --> 8119.639
pressure it's like it never stops the

8117.159 --> 8121.679
gas pressure and the container are so

8119.639 --> 8123.599
intricately tied it's like you could

8121.679 --> 8125.679
start asking philosophical questions

8123.599 --> 8128.1990000000005
it's like is the gas pressure the

8125.679 --> 8130.92
container is the container the gas

8128.199 --> 8132.48
pressure and you wouldn't just be weirdo

8130.92 --> 8134.88
hippie dippy

8132.48 --> 8136.799999999999
blabbering that actually there is

8134.88 --> 8139.2390000000005
something in to that because it's so

8136.8 --> 8143.1990000000005
intricately tight you can't get away

8139.239 --> 8145.839999999999
from it you can't know whether gas what

8143.199 --> 8148.199
gas would do if it would press if it

8145.84 --> 8150.0
didn't have a container because it does

8148.199 --> 8154.36
have a container they're so intricately

8150.0 --> 8154.36
tied in it's just the way it

8154.48 --> 8162.04
is so all we got is what always is and

8158.28 --> 8164.28
that's natural law and that is that gas

8162.04 --> 8166.559
is there because there is a container to

8164.28 --> 8166.559
press

8176.719 --> 8183.36
upon

8179.719 --> 8185.2390000000005
microwave can meat

8183.36 --> 8188.239
water

8185.239 --> 8188.239
to

8188.8 --> 8191.8
76

8194.28 --> 8202.359
what one ATO what the [ __ ] does that

8198.639 --> 8206.679
mean that makes no sense Ken langlo

8202.359 --> 8210.24
like uh it would

8206.679 --> 8213.319
explode I mean that's going to be how is

8210.24 --> 8213.319
that at one

8213.96 --> 8220.438999999998
atmosphere what the [ __ ] is he talking

8216.12 --> 8220.439
about this just seems completely made

8233.84 --> 8240.599
up how the [ __ ] is water going to retain

8237.439 --> 8243.719000000001
the that amount of temperature at that

8240.599 --> 8246.08
pressure and not dissipate that makes no

8243.719 --> 8249.438999999998
freaking sense where the hell are you

8246.08 --> 8249.439
getting this hor [ __ ] Ken

8254.679 --> 8260.28
langy I seem to screen to Lun this

8258.16 --> 8264.28
evening yeah well that's just because of

8260.28 --> 8269.880000000001
the lighting and I don't need [ __ ]

8264.28 --> 8273.599
glasses [ __ ] say that again kicking you

8269.88 --> 8275.96
out yeah glasses are for gaze I don't

8273.599 --> 8275.960000000001
need

8277.559 --> 8282.92
glasses just needed to turn on the light

8280.16 --> 8285.2
a bit Yeah because everything is all

8282.92 --> 8286.960000000001
darkening except this really white

8285.2 --> 8288.479000000001
bright light from my screen right in

8286.96 --> 8291.759999999998
front of me that's going to make me

8288.479 --> 8295.199999999999
squint a little cuz I'm adapting to all

8291.76 --> 8298.08
the light changes yeah not glasses I'm

8295.2 --> 8299.519
reading this perfectly I'm not squinting

8298.08 --> 8302.28
because I can't read it now I'm

8299.519 --> 8304.599
squinting because the light is like in

8302.28 --> 8304.599
my

8308.559 --> 8317.639
face no can langlo Nathan does not claim

8312.04 --> 8319.479000000001
waterproof boils at 100° that's a straw

8317.639 --> 8324.399
man

8319.479 --> 8326.24
100° is not part of the scientific

8324.399 --> 8328.96
method

8326.24 --> 8336.439
numerical value

8328.96 --> 8343.039999999999
values are not part of the scientific

8336.439 --> 8347.0
value that's why I didn't name any

8343.04 --> 8349.84
numbers when I gave my scientific

8347.0 --> 8352.84
experiment

8349.84 --> 8352.84
example

8353.599 --> 8359.439
yeah look it up oh look up some [ __ ]

8360.399 --> 8363.76
no I'm not looking anything

8368.519 --> 8371.519
up

8373.24 --> 8382.399
yeah 100° C is just a

8377.719 --> 8386.438999999998
colloquial average side data not

8382.399 --> 8389.439
relevant to the scientific

8386.439 --> 8389.439
experiment

8390.76 --> 8394.960000000001
because different conditions yeah

8392.76 --> 8397.399
changes the temperature of the water

8394.96 --> 8399.039999999999
boiling right you put some minerals in

8397.399 --> 8401.16
there oh guess what yeah the boiling

8399.04 --> 8403.6
temperature goes down H that's

8401.16 --> 8405.24
interesting oh guess what you you

8403.6 --> 8407.56
heighten the pressure wow boiling

8405.24 --> 8410.64
temperature goes down wow that's

8407.56 --> 8415.08
interesting oh yeah uh what

8410.64 --> 8415.08
else what else could you do you

8415.96 --> 8420.919999999998
know higher

8418.0 --> 8423.56
heighten the pressure lower the

8420.92 --> 8427.12
pressure dilute it more mix it in with

8423.56 --> 8429.88
other stuff that'll the boiling point

8427.12 --> 8433.04
whatever that all changes it all changes

8429.88 --> 8433.839999999998
all depending on complicated combination

8433.04 --> 8436.240000000002
of

8433.84 --> 8439.0
circumstances that are very predictable

8436.24 --> 8442.96
though it has all been worked out but

8439.0 --> 8448.28
it's not relevant to the fact that there

8442.96 --> 8451.72
is no exception to that heat

8448.28 --> 8455.04
introducing heat to water in a continual

8451.72 --> 8459.16
amount not just one time a little bit

8455.04 --> 8460.720000000001
but a continual amount of heat being

8459.16 --> 8465.359
introduced to

8460.72 --> 8468.438999999998
water oil ways lead to the water boiling

8465.359 --> 8471.960000000001
turning from a liquid into a gaseous

8468.439 --> 8479.24
state that is the scientific formulation

8471.96 --> 8479.24
of it numerical values are irrelevant

8486.359 --> 8492.359
keep keep inserting your strawman hor

8488.439 --> 8492.359
[ __ ] Canen langlo I'll just kick you out

8493.28 --> 8500.2
again just lay down the [ __ ] straw

8496.88 --> 8502.56
man with numerical values one other time

8500.2 --> 8504.08
Ken and I will kick you out just just do

8502.56 --> 8507.359
it come

8504.08 --> 8509.72
on you can copy paste the same crap

8507.359 --> 8513.24
rewrite it slightly another

8509.72 --> 8516.039999999999
time and when you do that one more time

8513.24 --> 8518.28
I will just kick you out again why don't

8516.04 --> 8522.800000000001
you try straw Manning again I'll kick

8518.28 --> 8522.800000000001
you out can I dare you come

8536.16 --> 8540.569
on

8537.52 --> 8540.569000000001
[Music]

8541.04 --> 8543.560000000001
be right

8566.16 --> 8569.16
back

8639.76 --> 8642.479
man it's getting

8642.84 --> 8647.68
dark the light's not really helping a

8645.359 --> 8647.68
lot

8656.0 --> 8659.0
here

8660.96 --> 8665.0
yeah good boy

8662.92 --> 8668.88
indeed right hope you're all enjoying

8665.0 --> 8671.08
the show it's been 2 hours 22 minutes 22

8668.88 --> 8674.839999999998
seconds thus far I'm

8671.08 --> 8674.84
still good to go some

8675.0 --> 8680.24
more but I'm getting a bit hungry for

8677.76 --> 8680.24
lunch

8685.96 --> 8688.96
though

8705.0 --> 8709.12
lunch it's so yeah

8710.24 --> 8713.56
yeah well

8714.279 --> 8722.439
look I got lunch usually like

8718.2 --> 8724.319000000001
between 4: and 6 then I get dinner

8722.439 --> 8727.359
usually

8724.319 --> 8729.76
between eight and

8727.359 --> 8733.399000000001
nine and

8729.76 --> 8736.359
then if I eat anything more it's usually

8733.399 --> 8740.72
like around 1 or 2

8736.359 --> 8740.720000000001
o00 our wian time

8741.279 --> 8748.880000000001
yes remember I I got roughly like a a

8744.88 --> 8748.88
27h hour cycle

8749.64 --> 8753.0
so sort

8771.359 --> 8775.800000000001
of what do I like to

8773.96 --> 8778.8
cook

8775.8 --> 8778.8
dinner

8779.52 --> 8784.24
all depends you had chicken broccoli

8782.16 --> 8788.24
yesterday I really needed

8784.24 --> 8788.24
that that was like so

8789.24 --> 8793.84
welcome I could probably could have like

8791.439 --> 8796.399
eaten a double portion of

8793.84 --> 8798.12
that cuz like right when I was done I

8796.399 --> 8802.319
was like yeah I can definitely eat more

8798.12 --> 8802.319000000001
of this but that was

8805.8 --> 8810.479
it

8808.319 --> 8814.16
favorite dishes there's all kinds of

8810.479 --> 8816.88
favorite dishes like everything I eat is

8814.16 --> 8816.88
things that I

8818.76 --> 8826.439
like wow really think that's going to

8822.84 --> 8826.439
work no

8832.72 --> 8837.88
sorry but one of my favorites during

8835.0 --> 8840.92
this winter has been

8837.88 --> 8842.199999999999
mashed potatoes with like a beef sausage

8840.92 --> 8844.92
in

8842.2 --> 8846.76
butter and then like you take all of it

8844.92 --> 8850.24
that your butter becomes the

8846.76 --> 8852.2
gravy and then like red beets alongside

8850.24 --> 8854.68
of that as vegetables and you have

8852.2 --> 8857.359
mashed potatoes with like butter gravy

8854.68 --> 8860.24
you like mix it all

8857.359 --> 8864.76
in still in the

8860.24 --> 8867.68
pan till it's all like this gravy Laden

8864.76 --> 8869.68
mashed potatoes then you put the sausage

8867.68 --> 8871.479000000001
on top of that and then the cooked beets

8869.68 --> 8873.52
on top of that and then I just like eat

8871.479 --> 8874.84
it out of the pan it stays hot for like

8873.52 --> 8879.76
an

8874.84 --> 8879.76
hour it's great for in the middle of the

8880.2 --> 8886.319000000001
winter cuz it's like all that buttery

8883.08 --> 8890.359
fat is like heating yeah you got like

8886.319 --> 8893.8
all this wo warmth in you for hours it's

8890.359 --> 8896.52
great feels so nourishing I mean if it's

8893.8 --> 8899.319
summer it's like it's too much then it's

8896.52 --> 8902.479000000001
just like oh this is so thick it'll slug

8899.319 --> 8906.08
you down but in the winter it's like

8902.479 --> 8906.08
yeah let's do

8907.92 --> 8914.56
this like in the summer I'd much rather

8911.319 --> 8918.519999999999
like have some lattice

8914.56 --> 8920.0
and salad type things because it's so

8918.52 --> 8922.08
hot and everything and then you don't

8920.0 --> 8925.04
want to have your system all clogged up

8922.08 --> 8927.08
with fats you don't need it as much

8925.04 --> 8930.319000000001
during the winter it's like if you just

8927.08 --> 8931.68
eat vegetables like you'll just feel

8930.319 --> 8935.319
like you could

8931.68 --> 8937.319
like break you'll just freeze and then

8935.319 --> 8938.64
something like breaks you snap like a

8937.319 --> 8940.56
twig or something that's what it would

8938.64 --> 8943.519999999999
feel like if you if I didn't eat enough

8940.56 --> 8943.519999999999
fats during the

8955.319 --> 8960.519999999999
winter but yeah that's a great meal

8957.84 --> 8963.52
during the winter

8960.52 --> 8963.52
and

8969.479 --> 8975.599999999999
yeah I

8971.56 --> 8978.199999999999
like spicy things during the winter a

8975.6 --> 8980.76
lot because it Heats you up gives you a

8978.2 --> 8981.52
Heat Rush makes the blood like forces it

8980.76 --> 8984.12
through

8981.52 --> 8985.92
you which is great and healthy because

8984.12 --> 8987.52
during the winter your blood flow isn't

8985.92 --> 8990.24
as much because because of the

8987.52 --> 8992.960000000001
cold so that's extra healthy and hey I

8990.24 --> 8992.96
like spicy

8993.319 --> 8997.359
things so like

8997.6 --> 9002.12
chili I would like make vegan chili is

9000.359 --> 9007.0
great for in the

9002.12 --> 9010.479000000001
winter with red kidney beans and

9007.0 --> 9015.439
zucchini a carrot

9010.479 --> 9019.72
base onions lots of garlic provential

9015.439 --> 9023.2
herbs uh that all in olive oil oh yeah

9019.72 --> 9023.199999999999
also some

9023.84 --> 9027.439
corn what them

9030.279 --> 9034.92
this oh yeah and some

9033.12 --> 9038.84
pineapple

9034.92 --> 9042.56
blocks that all together is

9038.84 --> 9042.56
anything I think I got

9043.279 --> 9051.6
it yeah all that together great

9048.12 --> 9053.6
thick vegetable with like like lots of

9051.6 --> 9057.24
heat in

9053.6 --> 9060.399000000001
there right oh yeah of course how could

9057.24 --> 9063.119999999999
I forget lots of fresh chili like a

9060.399 --> 9064.88
bunch of chili dried powder that's all

9063.12 --> 9067.12
nice it makes it hot and everything it

9064.88 --> 9070.119999999999
doesn't compare to actually cutting the

9067.12 --> 9074.479000000001
red chili fresh and hey when I make

9070.12 --> 9076.92
chili like that vegan chili I do a lot

9074.479 --> 9080.399
of chili peppers in there

9076.92 --> 9083.08
like that's going to be like a bushel of

9080.399 --> 9083.08
Red Hot Chili

9083.92 --> 9088.960000000001
febers and that's like the hottest you

9086.2 --> 9091.2
can get too because if you just get some

9088.96 --> 9096.358999999999
these days in a little pot even organic

9091.2 --> 9100.439
ones it's like this is so wastified

9096.359 --> 9102.92
like any person from Indonesia would

9100.439 --> 9106.720000000001
take a lick from that and say this is

9102.92 --> 9109.960000000001
like [ __ ] Western spice there there's

9106.72 --> 9114.72
literally no heat in this at all so

9109.96 --> 9118.319
weak so weak so spicel these

9114.72 --> 9120.8
days but actual fresh Chili Peppers they

9118.319 --> 9123.519999999999
do have plenty of heat the ones that I

9120.8 --> 9125.479
can get in the supermarket there some of

9123.52 --> 9127.92
have been even like grown in the

9125.479 --> 9129.479
Netherlands and they're like plenty hot

9127.92 --> 9132.84
they're like they give

9129.479 --> 9135.599999999999
you heat Rush yeah somewhow you can take

9132.84 --> 9137.16
a spoon of that and literally nothing

9135.6 --> 9139.960000000001
happens

9137.16 --> 9143.84
it's like chewing on a mint that's like

9139.96 --> 9143.839999999998
as far as it goes with heat it's

9145.68 --> 9150.0
pathetic making you hungry yeah

9150.84 --> 9155.16
that's that's Jenna massie's

9156.12 --> 9162.800000000001
fault you put sausage in your chili yeah

9160.04 --> 9165.800000000001
well I don't put meat in my chili

9162.8 --> 9168.16
anymore I used to make it just chili con

9165.8 --> 9170.92
caret that's the original recipe but

9168.16 --> 9176.68
then I replaced the

9170.92 --> 9180.04
Carney with uh carrot it works

9176.68 --> 9183.84
better and it stays

9180.04 --> 9186.84
better you can eat that chili sin

9183.84 --> 9189.92
Carney after keeping it in the cooler

9186.84 --> 9193.64
for like six days to a

9189.92 --> 9196.56
week if you make it with meat and you

9193.64 --> 9200.08
don't eat it after like the fourth day

9196.56 --> 9204.319
you can get really weird from it because

9200.08 --> 9209.0
meat doesn't last as long without the

9204.319 --> 9212.0
meat in it it rots less

9209.0 --> 9215.16
quick it stays relatively more

9212.0 --> 9217.2
nutritious over time and that's very

9215.16 --> 9220.52
specifically is the reason why I don't

9217.2 --> 9223.960000000001
make my chili with meat

9220.52 --> 9226.16
anymore cuz now like I would only make

9223.96 --> 9229.08
it with meat if I knew that like it's

9226.16 --> 9232.359
it's going to all get eaten that day

9229.08 --> 9234.399
like if I had a family of people to like

9232.359 --> 9236.319
cook for then I might make it and it's

9234.399 --> 9238.84
like okay you like hot stuff you like

9236.319 --> 9240.88
chili I can make that and then I might

9238.84 --> 9243.479
make it with meat just just to try it

9240.88 --> 9245.199999999999
out what that's like again and then it

9243.479 --> 9246.84
would all be eaten and there's no

9245.2 --> 9250.16
problem at

9246.84 --> 9252.24
all but I don't really cook for more

9250.16 --> 9255.84
than just me these

9252.24 --> 9259.64
days so I make it without meat and that

9255.84 --> 9263.12
way I can have food for a very long time

9259.64 --> 9266.319
without the quality of that food going

9263.12 --> 9269.2
down over time that's why I now make it

9266.319 --> 9271.92
vegan it's purely

9269.2 --> 9273.880000000001
pragmatic and to be fair I actually like

9271.92 --> 9277.56
the taste of it better without me I

9273.88 --> 9277.56
really do I like it

9278.359 --> 9283.04
better I don't know that's just the way

9281.439 --> 9287.439
it

9283.04 --> 9290.76
is I've eaten chili for a long time

9287.439 --> 9293.08
it's one of my first self-sufficient

9290.76 --> 9295.64
cooking recipes that I would do together

9293.08 --> 9297.64
with spaghetti which I back then also

9295.64 --> 9301.0
made with meatloaf I make my spaghetti

9297.64 --> 9303.24
vegan as well for the same reason it

9301.0 --> 9307.24
stays better over

9303.24 --> 9310.08
time and you don't really need the

9307.24 --> 9314.8
meat to get like the perfect spaghetti

9310.08 --> 9314.8
taste actually you don't need it at

9315.0 --> 9319.8
all

9317.439 --> 9325.52
no I'm not a

9319.8 --> 9328.119999999999
vegan yeah I I just ate chicken broccoli

9325.52 --> 9330.92
yesterday and this evening again I'm

9328.12 --> 9335.160000000002
going to eat mashed potatoes

9330.92 --> 9338.64
with gravy from high quality organic

9335.16 --> 9341.92
butter in which a beef sausage has been

9338.64 --> 9344.358999999999
baked the juice inside like I stick it

9341.92 --> 9346.68
so that the juice comes running out adds

9344.359 --> 9348.720000000001
with the gravy

9346.68 --> 9351.08
and then I mash the potatoes and throw

9348.72 --> 9354.92
it directly into the gravy after I got

9351.08 --> 9358.16
the sausage out mix it all up put the

9354.92 --> 9360.8
sausage back in and then put the cooked

9358.16 --> 9364.6
beets alongside

9360.8 --> 9368.039999999999
that very not

9364.6 --> 9371.6
vegan yeah but just because I'm not a

9368.04 --> 9377.12
strict vegan for whatever reason doesn't

9371.6 --> 9380.12
mean that I don't like certain meals

9377.12 --> 9382.6
made in a vegan setting it works great

9380.12 --> 9382.6
it's

9382.92 --> 9389.16
better not because oh eating less meat

9386.24 --> 9392.479
is better no it's because you don't

9389.16 --> 9394.8
always have to eat it and it doesn't

9392.479 --> 9397.72
spoil as quick like for me the tendency

9394.8 --> 9400.24
is oh you want to eat meat then make it

9397.72 --> 9403.72
in a way that you guarantee to actually

9400.24 --> 9407.56
eat that meat the day that you prepare

9403.72 --> 9410.399
it you don't have it in some sauce

9407.56 --> 9412.88
staying around in the fridge for a time

9410.399 --> 9415.76
yeah I specifically strategize my

9412.88 --> 9419.64
cooking to avoid that

9415.76 --> 9423.2
happening when I was younger I've gotten

9419.64 --> 9425.399
sick because of specifically that like

9423.2 --> 9428.359
oh this nice sauce yeah it was there in

9425.399 --> 9430.039999999999
in the cooler for a week it still tastes

9428.359 --> 9431.92
great and then everybody gets sick

9430.04 --> 9434.800000000001
because it might have tasted great but

9431.92 --> 9436.439
the meat in it actually did

9434.8 --> 9438.0
spoil

9436.439 --> 9440.279
yeah that sort of thing I'm not doing

9438.0 --> 9440.279
that

9446.479 --> 9455.278999999999
again bacon potato cheese ew ew no I

9453.88 --> 9458.399
don't eat

9455.279 --> 9460.800000000001
bacon and I very rarely eat

9458.399 --> 9463.56
cheese definitely not going to combine

9460.8 --> 9463.56
that

9464.8 --> 9468.479
thanks

9466.319 --> 9470.359
stuffed bell peppers yeah that is very

9468.479 --> 9472.479
cool though that is interesting I like

9470.359 --> 9474.08
those with the right type of cream

9472.479 --> 9477.24
cheese the problem is that that most

9474.08 --> 9480.12
cream cheese that

9477.24 --> 9483.24
I've that I've noticed out there even

9480.12 --> 9486.359
the organic versions like they don't sit

9483.24 --> 9489.92
well it might taste like kind of nice

9486.359 --> 9495.08
for a bit but as it's in my

9489.92 --> 9496.84
system it's just not great I'm not super

9495.08 --> 9500.479
good with cheese

9496.84 --> 9500.479
anymore one pork

9501.64 --> 9505.439
disgusting I just don't eat

9510.16 --> 9513.56
it I just

9513.68 --> 9518.52
avoid

9516.24 --> 9521.08
like yeah

9518.52 --> 9523.84
bacon I get it I have a lot of fun

9521.08 --> 9527.8
memories of bacon but since I stopped

9523.84 --> 9531.359
eating it now there is like this side

9527.8 --> 9534.0
taste smell thing to it and that really

9531.359 --> 9537.479000000001
stands out to me now it's kind of

9534.0 --> 9539.76
similar to like with goat meat or sheep

9537.479 --> 9541.84
meat right some people really like it

9539.76 --> 9544.52
and it's apparently really healthy but

9541.84 --> 9547.68
there's this really specific oily taste

9544.52 --> 9550.359
and smell to it that some people really

9547.68 --> 9553.76
don't like I am one of those people that

9550.359 --> 9557.0
really doesn't like that and for me pig

9553.76 --> 9559.880000000001
meat has the same thing

9557.0 --> 9561.2
it's not gross but it's like weird and

9559.88 --> 9564.72
it's

9561.2 --> 9567.6
like it feels

9564.72 --> 9569.479
wrong I don't like it when I walk into a

9567.6 --> 9572.12
place and it all smells like bacon it

9569.479 --> 9574.56
makes me feel a bit dirty and

9572.12 --> 9578.240000000002
greasy it's just not what it used to be

9574.56 --> 9580.92
it doesn't like oh oh I want that

9578.24 --> 9584.6
no it's

9580.92 --> 9589.6
just I don't like this I love the smell

9584.6 --> 9589.6
of chicken or beef or something

9590.2 --> 9594.560000000001
definitely but

9597.399 --> 9601.599999999999
bacon this just something weird about

9602.08 --> 9608.88
it cannibal said pork tastes like you

9605.399 --> 9610.76
human meat yeah oh there's theories

9608.88 --> 9612.96
about that duper and I've said some

9610.76 --> 9616.12
things

9612.96 --> 9620.358999999999
like in the far past

9616.12 --> 9624.240000000002
pigs may have actually been like animals

9620.359 --> 9626.52
that have been hybridized and altered by

9624.24 --> 9630.399
Gene like ancient genetic Engineers

9626.52 --> 9632.04
specifically to be organ growing vessels

9630.399 --> 9634.399
for human

9632.04 --> 9638.04
beings so that they have might they

9634.399 --> 9641.08
might have been like slightly hybridized

9638.04 --> 9644.080000000002
with humans in order to achieve that and

9641.08 --> 9647.6
if that were the case then pigs are

9644.08 --> 9650.319
arguably genetic Al slightly

9647.6 --> 9653.08
related they would have to be to fulfill

9650.319 --> 9656.92
that specific function I mean what the

9653.08 --> 9660.56
hell is a pig it's a giant rib cage that

9656.92 --> 9663.12
has a lot of room for organs the rest is

9660.56 --> 9665.479
just a bunch of short legs a snout it

9663.12 --> 9668.359
can eat anything like what the hell is

9665.479 --> 9668.358999999999
that creature

9668.56 --> 9674.439
like it just looks like it's a giant

9671.12 --> 9678.68
organ carrying device it's

9674.439 --> 9680.800000000001
ridiculous look at it an adult pig looks

9678.68 --> 9683.439
ridiculous like that creature can't

9680.8 --> 9683.438999999998
survive in

9684.04 --> 9691.0
nature there's no way like wild swines

9688.439 --> 9693.24
maybe they're ridiculous but they have

9691.0 --> 9696.319
like distinct strengths and all that the

9693.24 --> 9698.96
regular red pigs what those creatures

9696.319 --> 9701.08
like they wouldn't survive a month in

9698.96 --> 9704.199999999999
the wild without

9701.08 --> 9707.439
humans it all get eaten and then they're

9704.2 --> 9707.439
done for

9726.359 --> 9732.12
okay Jenny Messi

9729.24 --> 9734.439
sure you never said that eating bacon is

9732.12 --> 9736.12
unhealthy it's just there's something

9734.439 --> 9739.64
wrong about it

9736.12 --> 9742.319000000001
cigar smoking I don't like that but I

9739.64 --> 9743.358999999999
mean I am a tobacco smoker and I don't

9742.319 --> 9745.72
believe

9743.359 --> 9750.439
that the

9745.72 --> 9753.679999999998
rumors oh you always get ccer

9750.439 --> 9756.399
nonsense oh it's bad

9753.68 --> 9760.24
nonsense it's all nonsense all I don't

9756.399 --> 9762.599999999999
believe it I think I think like what

9760.24 --> 9765.24
happened with the tobacco Lobby and

9762.6 --> 9769.12
their attack oh they're so unhealthy is

9765.24 --> 9770.72
the the same thing like right now the

9769.12 --> 9773.0
oil Mega

9770.72 --> 9775.56
corporations saying how we need to get

9773.0 --> 9779.439
rid of fossil

9775.56 --> 9782.6
fuels yeah guess who's doing that oil

9779.439 --> 9785.0
Mega corporations it's all a

9782.6 --> 9789.319
racket all of

9785.0 --> 9791.72
it yeah they needed to get rid of

9789.319 --> 9794.278999999999
tobacco normalization because it was

9791.72 --> 9796.199999999999
giving people an edge

9794.279 --> 9798.52
mentally

9796.2 --> 9801.319000000001
and they didn't want that because they

9798.52 --> 9804.439
want everybody to be subservient weak

9801.319 --> 9806.68
slaves and they can't have that edge mly

9804.439 --> 9808.479000000001
so what do you do you demonize it to all

9806.68 --> 9811.16
hell say that oh everybody gets sick

9808.479 --> 9813.479
because of that it's a burden on society

9811.16 --> 9819.039999999999
it's dirty

9813.479 --> 9821.96
yeah to shame everybody into dropping

9819.04 --> 9824.880000000001
it like communism

9821.96 --> 9827.179999999998
does cuz now it's bad because of some

9824.88 --> 9829.199999999999
new idea total

9827.18 --> 9831.52
[Applause]

9829.2 --> 9833.640000000001
horseshit like hundreds of people

9831.52 --> 9837.399000000001
throughout history that made it past the

9833.64 --> 9840.599999999999
age of 100 smoking every freaking day

9837.399 --> 9843.56
it's absolute hor [ __ ] it's a lie a

9840.6 --> 9847.52
straight out propaganda

9843.56 --> 9848.88
lie yeah and hey you can die from lung

9847.52 --> 9851.720000000001
cancer being a

9848.88 --> 9853.56
smoker if you live a [ __ ] up life and

9851.72 --> 9855.599999999999
you drink a bunch maybe or maybe you

9853.56 --> 9857.64
don't drink a bunch and you take calling

9855.6 --> 9859.720000000001
the side medications oh I'm sure they're

9857.64 --> 9863.199999999999
not going to contribute to anything bad

9859.72 --> 9867.119999999999
happening oh no no of course not right

9863.2 --> 9870.880000000001
cuz I mean everybody in the 19th century

9867.12 --> 9873.439
all the hospitals were full of old men

9870.88 --> 9875.479
with lung cancer they all ended up in

9873.439 --> 9878.52
the hospital because everybody was a

9875.479 --> 9881.92
smoker all day [ __ ] long at work at

9878.52 --> 9884.399000000001
your dinner table at the bed before

9881.92 --> 9886.72
sleeping smoke smoke smoke smoke smoke

9884.399 --> 9890.519999999999
and of course in the 19th century it was

9886.72 --> 9893.72
everywhere everywhere smoking it was so

9890.52 --> 9895.68
[ __ ] normal you could buy

9893.72 --> 9898.08
cigarettes right where you would be

9895.68 --> 9900.56
buying your newspaper which is literally

9898.08 --> 9903.76
at every freaking Street Corner yeah

9900.56 --> 9908.119999999999
that's how normal it was oh guess what

9903.76 --> 9910.16
though oh yeah no hospitals full with

9908.12 --> 9912.279
thousands and thousands of long

9910.16 --> 9915.96
cancerous old men because of they

9912.279 --> 9917.279
smoking all their life no no it was a

9915.96 --> 9921.358999999999
rare

9917.279 --> 9924.319000000001
thing remember cancer being a rare thing

9921.359 --> 9926.439
oh yeah people would go travel half the

9924.319 --> 9930.519999999999
world just to see it because this was so

9926.439 --> 9933.800000000001
rare yeah yeah and everybody was chain

9930.52 --> 9936.52
smoking in the 19th century though and

9933.8 --> 9940.199999999999
there were no hospitals full of cancer

9936.52 --> 9945.439
lung cancerous dying old men

9940.2 --> 9950.04
yeah because smoking tobacco doesn't

9945.439 --> 9951.960000000001
always just cause lung cancer it's

9950.04 --> 9956.84
nonsense it's

9951.96 --> 9959.16
propaganda it's lies medical

9956.84 --> 9963.2
lies

9959.16 --> 9968.2
yeah people in the 19th century in the

9963.2 --> 9973.399000000001
west were smoking their asses

9968.2 --> 9976.240000000002
off and getting cancer and dying was not

9973.399 --> 9982.278999999999
a default

9976.24 --> 9987.56
even though almost all the men would be

9982.279 --> 9989.880000000001
smoking every day their entire

9987.56 --> 9994.24
life

9989.88 --> 9998.199999999999
culturally and no hospitals filled with

9994.24 --> 9999.24
dying old men that had lung cancer yeah

9998.2 --> 10004.0
that didn't

9999.24 --> 10005.92
exist so it's a

10004.0 --> 10010.279
lie

10005.92 --> 10014.88
do you understand it's a lie it's a

10010.279 --> 10016.12
historically provable lie the stats

10014.88 --> 10018.679999999998
don't work

10016.12 --> 10021.640000000001
out data is

10018.68 --> 10025.0
ignored it was a

10021.64 --> 10027.8
lie and now you've been shamed out of

10025.0 --> 10030.279
smoking because it's so bad for you oh

10027.8 --> 10032.92
no oh oh but take the take the shots

10030.279 --> 10035.720000000001
though yeah

10032.92 --> 10039.64
yeah yeah that's not going do anything

10035.72 --> 10042.16
to you that smokeing oh my god oh yes

10039.64 --> 10044.64
the terrible lung cancer even though

10042.16 --> 10047.039999999999
hospitals in the 19th century were

10044.64 --> 10051.278999999999
absolutely not filled with dying old

10047.04 --> 10052.080000000002
lung cancerous men yeah that that was

10051.279 --> 10055.52
not

10052.08 --> 10058.359
there yeah cancer then was very rare

10055.52 --> 10062.92
even though everybody smoked so it's all

10058.359 --> 10062.92
a lie always

10063.92 --> 10066.92
was

10070.439 --> 10074.319
organic food is satanic what the [ __ ]

10072.479 --> 10077.8
are you talking

10074.319 --> 10077.8
about you're

10081.279 --> 10085.04
queer shut the [ __ ]

10085.6 --> 10089.2
up this is

10092.319 --> 10098.16
stupid oh yeah this is [ __ ] [ __ ]

10095.0 --> 10098.16
get the [ __ ] out of here

10115.319 --> 10121.399
bye e piece of vacon okay Jenny Massie

10119.0 --> 10123.8
that's pretty gross I didn't really need

10121.399 --> 10126.08
to know about

10123.8 --> 10128.8
that

10126.08 --> 10130.319
it's forbidden in the Bible to eat pork

10128.8 --> 10134.278999999999
yes I'm sure it

10130.319 --> 10136.84
is I don't eat it I ate it when I was a

10134.279 --> 10141.399000000001
kid I really liked eating it as I was a

10136.84 --> 10141.399
kid I don't think it really did any

10142.08 --> 10150.2
good and I've been

10145.96 --> 10150.199999999999
better since I stopped eating

10150.6 --> 10156.6
it I think that eating pork might

10153.08 --> 10158.64
actually like impair judgment

10156.6 --> 10161.439
but that's a bit of a stretch I mean I

10158.64 --> 10164.278999999999
have no direct link to like claim some

10161.439 --> 10167.04
kind of causation with that but there

10164.279 --> 10169.08
might be something maybe eating pork

10167.04 --> 10172.160000000002
actually clouds your

10169.08 --> 10176.6
judgment I mean but how do you really

10172.16 --> 10176.6
prove that that's difficult I have a

10179.279 --> 10184.399000000001
suspicion it would be very interesting

10182.239 --> 10187.479
really to try to test it but I mean you

10184.399 --> 10190.039999999999
got to have a really good setup a good

10187.479 --> 10192.119999999999
vision of how you would do that in order

10190.04 --> 10195.960000000001
to really be able to test it properly

10192.12 --> 10195.960000000001
without turning completely

10206.04 --> 10210.439
inconclusive but I mean you could

10208.239 --> 10212.92
technically tested by just seeing

10210.439 --> 10215.319
certain people they always eat Park

10212.92 --> 10218.04
other people they don't eat Park just

10215.319 --> 10220.84
compare it just directly compare

10218.04 --> 10222.68
it what's the average attention span of

10220.84 --> 10225.2
somebody that eats pork versus somebody

10222.68 --> 10228.399
that doesn't e pork bang let's go jet

10225.2 --> 10230.16
GTP let's get a worldwide statistical

10228.399 --> 10234.199999999999
analysis just like

10230.16 --> 10237.88
that there should be either absolutely

10234.2 --> 10240.08
not a correlation or there might be some

10237.88 --> 10241.96
correlation and there might be even like

10240.08 --> 10244.84
oh there's a subc correlation through

10241.96 --> 10246.519999999999
genetics with some people it it's like

10244.84 --> 10248.359
bad for their concentration and others

10246.52 --> 10250.560000000001
it has no influence whatsoever that

10248.359 --> 10254.52
could also be the case right maybe

10250.56 --> 10257.56
it's Clouts your judgment for certain

10254.52 --> 10259.6
groups and not for

10257.56 --> 10263.56
others

10259.6 --> 10266.56
well how do you find out Mass

10263.56 --> 10269.76
statistical data

10266.56 --> 10272.278999999999
analysis that's how you could get an

10269.76 --> 10272.279
some kind of

10272.96 --> 10278.16
hint Pig St

10275.68 --> 10281.359
well a theory that I could give behind a

10278.16 --> 10283.8
reasoning like that is the fat because

10281.359 --> 10286.6
what do we what do pork eaters typically

10283.8 --> 10289.358999999999
like bacon why does make bacon so great

10286.6 --> 10291.319
it's the fat it's the pig fat right you

10289.359 --> 10296.239
bake it in it and it's oh tasty and

10291.319 --> 10299.239
yummy well fat is a critical component

10296.239 --> 10303.0
in your brain function your brain is

10299.239 --> 10305.08
greatly consistent of fats Omega fatty

10303.0 --> 10308.72
acids to be specific

10305.08 --> 10312.479
well certain type of fats don't work

10308.72 --> 10316.319
well on that brain function like for

10312.479 --> 10320.358999999999
example uh sunflower seed oil I've

10316.319 --> 10324.359
tested that it measurably noticeably for

10320.359 --> 10326.319
my senses made me get foggy and had

10324.359 --> 10329.0
trouble concentrating because of that

10326.319 --> 10332.199999999999
acutely for a period of time after I ate

10329.0 --> 10335.279
it so maybe there is something similar

10332.2 --> 10337.6
with pork fat this could be tested maybe

10335.279 --> 10339.560000000001
pork fat has a certain disruptive

10337.6 --> 10344.279
quality because of the fats that'll get

10339.56 --> 10348.039999999999
in the way of your normal brain

10344.279 --> 10349.6
function see now there is a template to

10348.04 --> 10352.04
try it

10349.6 --> 10355.2
out

10352.04 --> 10358.080000000002
see it could be figured out whether this

10355.2 --> 10361.640000000001
is the case or not I just have a vague

10358.08 --> 10364.2
suspicion based on my own correlation

10361.64 --> 10366.358999999999
based experiences cuz I haven't actually

10364.2 --> 10369.640000000001
said set out to really test it

10366.359 --> 10371.279
empirically but I have past

10369.64 --> 10374.08
experiences and that's where the

10371.279 --> 10374.08
suspicion comes

10381.239 --> 10386.96
from yeah yeah blue pill Devolution is

10385.279 --> 10390.84
that is interesting isn't

10386.96 --> 10392.839999999998
it it is dude they may even made a movie

10390.84 --> 10395.12
for it called Thank You for

10392.84 --> 10397.880000000001
Smoking about this guy that is a

10395.12 --> 10401.239000000001
lobbyist for the smoking

10397.88 --> 10403.199999999999
industry you know what that entire thing

10401.239 --> 10408.08
is just a giant hitpiece

10403.2 --> 10408.08
it's about as accurate as Schindler's

10408.359 --> 10411.359
List

10412.0 --> 10417.12
seriously it's all oh smoking bed oh any

10415.359 --> 10419.04
amount of money and we can Lobby it out

10417.12 --> 10421.08
of here and then oh wow yours you

10419.04 --> 10423.399000000001
successfully saved the tobacco business

10421.08 --> 10427.279
with your brilliant lobbying oh we have

10423.399 --> 10429.96
a mob mobile phone Corporation owner

10427.279 --> 10432.399000000001
here who would love to have your

10429.96 --> 10434.599999999999
advice Ser that's literally Thank You

10432.399 --> 10436.399
for Smoking the movie and it is an

10434.6 --> 10439.2
interesting movie it is it is

10436.399 --> 10440.92
interesting it is about that smoking guy

10439.2 --> 10444.04
that you're talking about that was used

10440.92 --> 10446.72
for the the Malboro man I think it was

10444.04 --> 10449.560000000001
yeah and he died of cancer lung cancer

10446.72 --> 10452.679999999998
oh no that didn't happen yeah but he was

10449.56 --> 10454.76
a freaking alcoholic man and he did

10452.68 --> 10456.08
probably use other drugs too that were

10454.76 --> 10458.800000000001
really

10456.08 --> 10462.039999999999
damaging when he was younger and all

10458.8 --> 10464.519999999999
that so yeah oh he had got cancer and

10462.04 --> 10469.52
died well you know what

10464.52 --> 10474.439
definitely doesn't get any better or

10469.52 --> 10476.92
heals cancer yeah drinking alcohol

10474.439 --> 10479.16
strong liquor yeah yeah yeah cancer

10476.92 --> 10482.399
definitely doesn't retract itself and

10479.16 --> 10484.84
fix itself with that all right but

10482.399 --> 10486.519999999999
smoking yeah

10484.84 --> 10488.52
I mean if you're going to be like change

10486.52 --> 10490.2
smoking I'm going to change smoke change

10488.52 --> 10492.319000000001
smoke yeah then if you have cancer yeah

10490.2 --> 10496.399000000001
it's not going to get any better but

10492.319 --> 10498.72
like oh you're just a little bit on the

10496.399 --> 10502.479
side yeah it's not going to like oh well

10498.72 --> 10504.278999999999
that means you're guaranteed to die then

10502.479 --> 10507.96
No

10504.279 --> 10510.0
Nonsense alcohol is way more damaging on

10507.96 --> 10512.64
your system than tobacco

10510.0 --> 10514.8
smoke way

10512.64 --> 10517.64
worse so

10514.8 --> 10518.64
it was all propaganda all of it it was

10517.64 --> 10524.16
from the

10518.64 --> 10526.239
start yeah the anti-smoking Lobby is

10524.16 --> 10528.68
very very

10526.239 --> 10532.08
comparable like late 20th century

10528.68 --> 10536.399
anti-smoking Lobby very very comparable

10532.08 --> 10539.2
to like the earlier 20th century pro-

10536.399 --> 10541.358999999999
feminist moves that did the opposite

10539.2 --> 10543.16
said oh women you're you can be smoking

10541.359 --> 10546.2
too that's that makes you cool it makes

10543.16 --> 10549.239
you high class

10546.2 --> 10550.92
remember it's the same [ __ ] except the

10549.239 --> 10553.8
other way around they wanted women

10550.92 --> 10556.92
smoking and they wanted men to stop

10553.8 --> 10557.96
smoking because women smoking is not

10556.92 --> 10561.08
good for

10557.96 --> 10564.08
fertility men's smoking gives them an

10561.08 --> 10566.68
edge in what they do typically that's

10564.08 --> 10569.88
why all the men were smoking for so long

10566.68 --> 10572.479000000001
for centuries because it gave them an

10569.88 --> 10574.56
edge mentally in their state and what

10572.479 --> 10577.199999999999
they did in business or War whatever

10574.56 --> 10579.64
they were doing where the women is just

10577.2 --> 10582.720000000001
unhealthy it it gets in the way of good

10579.64 --> 10585.68
pregnancies all that yeah so what did

10582.72 --> 10587.358999999999
they do they lobbied hey women you're

10585.68 --> 10590.279
really cool if you're smoking oh you're

10587.359 --> 10593.319
so you're so badass you're so high class

10590.279 --> 10594.84
yeah and then later oh everybody's bad

10593.319 --> 10597.0
if you're smoking you're bad if you're

10594.84 --> 10600.479
smoking oh you can't smoke in public oh

10597.0 --> 10603.16
you're so evil oh it's it's we're not

10600.479 --> 10605.76
going to you're going to heighten the

10603.16 --> 10608.0
cost of your medical bills if you dare

10605.76 --> 10610.04
smoke it's got to get out of it your

10608.0 --> 10613.359
insurance money is going to go up if you

10610.04 --> 10615.800000000001
don't do something about the public

10613.359 --> 10618.08
smoking right so take it away from the

10615.8 --> 10619.599999999999
men from the working

10618.08 --> 10622.039999999999
class

10619.6 --> 10626.319
yeah that's why to try to

10622.04 --> 10630.640000000001
do take the smoking away from the men

10626.319 --> 10634.84
where it did some good shove it in the

10630.64 --> 10637.599999999999
woman's lot where it can do some damage

10634.84 --> 10640.08
yeah that's what's

10637.6 --> 10642.56
happened yeah where do we know tobacco

10640.08 --> 10645.319
from originally supposedly Native

10642.56 --> 10649.359
Americans who were doing the smoking

10645.319 --> 10652.64
yeah the women no no the women were not

10649.359 --> 10655.16
doing the smoking yeah no it was the men

10652.64 --> 10658.72
there were specifically the leaders the

10655.16 --> 10661.439
leaders would do the smoking rituals

10658.72 --> 10662.84
yeah not the women why would they be

10661.439 --> 10665.960000000001
doing that why would they have the

10662.84 --> 10668.52
tradition of like the tribe leaders they

10665.96 --> 10671.479
smoke not the women

10668.52 --> 10674.68
yeah so of

10671.479 --> 10678.199999999999
course based on that knowledge of the or

10674.68 --> 10680.960000000001
origin of the use of it of course they

10678.2 --> 10684.359
had to lobby for women to become smokers

10680.96 --> 10685.358999999999
and then for nobody to dare be smokers

10684.359 --> 10687.640000000001
in

10685.359 --> 10689.960000000001
public because that's an offense to

10687.64 --> 10692.92
other people there to take it all

10689.96 --> 10696.319
away

10692.92 --> 10698.52
yeah that's what

10696.319 --> 10704.56
happened because

10698.52 --> 10704.560000000001
smoking does not give you Fatal lung

10705.56 --> 10713.72
cancer you need to do a a lot of other

10709.479 --> 10716.119999999999
stuff on the side there to really even

10713.72 --> 10718.08
make that

10716.12 --> 10720.279
happen

10718.08 --> 10722.279
yeah not good take good care of your

10720.279 --> 10726.279
lungs not clean your

10722.279 --> 10728.52
lungs not use using good filters or

10726.279 --> 10730.800000000001
doing a lot of stress smoking yeah if

10728.52 --> 10732.960000000001
you're like a stress smoker like

10730.8 --> 10736.358999999999
somebody said something bad to me I have

10732.96 --> 10738.199999999999
to walk away and like chain smoke for

10736.359 --> 10740.52
cigarettes before I can calm down yeah

10738.2 --> 10744.0
well that will [ __ ] you up why because

10740.52 --> 10747.76
of the way you're smoking it because of

10744.0 --> 10750.84
the intention behind the process you're

10747.76 --> 10754.279
then smoking to have the drug suppress

10750.84 --> 10757.960000000001
your body as a distraction for your mind

10754.279 --> 10760.2
which is a bad entry you're not giving

10757.96 --> 10762.278999999999
yourself a nice moment of calm down

10760.2 --> 10766.16
you're not using it as a transition

10762.279 --> 10768.6
liquid to just lighten up no you're

10766.16 --> 10770.359
suppressing suppressing suppressing well

10768.6 --> 10773.2
guess what that's really bad for you

10770.359 --> 10775.640000000001
that's bad for your system suppressive

10773.2 --> 10777.6
smoking yeah that might give you lung

10775.64 --> 10780.599999999999
cancer it's not because of the tobacco

10777.6 --> 10784.800000000001
it's because of how you're smoking it

10780.6 --> 10786.399000000001
for what reason you are using it

10784.8 --> 10789.278999999999
that's going to lead to damage the

10786.399 --> 10791.0
intention is the damaging part if you do

10789.279 --> 10793.16
it wrong if you do it for the wrong

10791.0 --> 10796.88
reasons and that's not just smoking guys

10793.16 --> 10800.08
that's everything everything you take

10796.88 --> 10801.96
even social

10800.08 --> 10803.399
interactions doesn't have to have

10801.96 --> 10804.839999999998
something have to be something that you

10803.399 --> 10807.599999999999
consume it's just your social

10804.84 --> 10809.72
interactions yeah bad intentions wrong

10807.6 --> 10811.880000000001
reasons it'll [ __ ] you up no matter what

10809.72 --> 10811.88
you

10812.76 --> 10815.76
do

10821.239 --> 10826.8
normaliz bacon and eggs American

10824.08 --> 10828.92
breakfast yeah sure I mean there's

10826.8 --> 10832.119999999999
nothing wrong with the eggs though the

10828.92 --> 10837.52
bacon part that's that's the weird part

10832.12 --> 10841.52
yeah but I mean people have had eggs for

10837.52 --> 10841.52
breakfast since Medieval

10841.96 --> 10850.759999999998
Times that's not new X for breakfast

10845.279 --> 10851.880000000001
great I I love it but the bacon no no no

10850.76 --> 10854.880000000001
no no

10851.88 --> 10859.119999999999
no that's the thing that he introduced

10854.88 --> 10863.64
that's what he made into it like to you

10859.12 --> 10866.880000000001
do the bacon with the eggs that wasn't

10863.64 --> 10869.519999999999
normal that was like okay

10866.88 --> 10871.358999999999
some some people might do that I mean

10869.52 --> 10873.16
some people like throw the craziest

10871.359 --> 10875.04
thing together right that doesn't mean

10873.16 --> 10877.119999999999
that everybody's going to do it but no

10875.04 --> 10881.04
they made it into a thing and then

10877.12 --> 10881.04
advertised it to make that

10884.56 --> 10890.319
normal but was it sigment FR that did

10887.2 --> 10892.84
that or was it

10890.319 --> 10895.16
uh the the propaganda Guy what's it

10892.84 --> 10895.16
called

10898.2 --> 10903.960000000001
again was it

10900.96 --> 10906.839999999998
Freud or was it Edward ber I thought it

10903.96 --> 10909.88
was Edward Ben that did the bacon and

10906.84 --> 10913.8
eggs standardization just like women

10909.88 --> 10913.8
smoking was Edward Ben

10914.04 --> 10919.880000000001
idea I didn't think th Freud did actual

10918.08 --> 10922.16
like social engineering like that he

10919.88 --> 10924.64
just had crazy ideas and hung around

10922.16 --> 10927.72
with Aristocrats and

10924.64 --> 10932.56
[ __ ] and

10927.72 --> 10935.119999999999
Marxist Beres sauce no not

10932.56 --> 10937.8
that I think he invented but that's not

10935.12 --> 10937.800000000001
where that comes

10942.0 --> 10948.92
from open faced sandwiches for breakfast

10946.12 --> 10952.359
cold meat fish cheese or vegetables yeah

10948.92 --> 10955.12
yeah that's right stey traveler we

10952.359 --> 10958.04
do so do

10955.12 --> 10961.08
I I had it yesterday yesterday what I

10958.04 --> 10962.439
did I'm going to talk about food again

10961.08 --> 10965.16
I'm going to get some lunch and after

10962.439 --> 10969.439
the show anyway but yesterday night I

10965.16 --> 10972.439
did like two slices of bread like heated

10969.439 --> 10974.880000000001
it like toast and covered it with butter

10972.439 --> 10979.68
then did the vegetable paste stuff again

10974.88 --> 10983.278999999999
on it and then a little bit of sambal on

10979.68 --> 10985.960000000001
top of it so have like this night bre

10983.279 --> 10988.800000000001
bread cracker with buttery in it

10985.96 --> 10991.759999999998
vegetable stuff and like some sharp

10988.8 --> 10994.759999999998
stuff great so

10991.76 --> 10996.64
nutritious but that's like on a flat top

10994.76 --> 11001.2
of

10996.64 --> 11003.319
bread why do smokers scoff a lot do they

11001.2 --> 11003.319000000001
I

11003.479 --> 11011.039999999999
don't but I mean you do build flam

11008.08 --> 11015.16
though like flam is a response to some

11011.04 --> 11018.12
of the chemicals that do accompany the

11015.16 --> 11020.64
burning of plants right some of those

11018.12 --> 11025.359
chemicals are not great for your lungs

11020.64 --> 11027.399
but your lungs will like absorb them and

11025.359 --> 11029.960000000001
then transform them thanks to your liver

11027.399 --> 11032.039999999999
and all that to undo the damage lungs

11029.96 --> 11034.08
regenerate quickly especially if you're

11032.04 --> 11037.2
a smoker because it has to if it doesn't

11034.08 --> 11039.6
you'll die quick lungs are very Dynamic

11037.2 --> 11042.279
organs they

11039.6 --> 11045.04
regenerate and if you smoke then you'll

11042.279 --> 11047.6
just it's going to be processing some

11045.04 --> 11050.160000000002
toxic stuff there too and that's going

11047.6 --> 11054.399000000001
to result in flam the flam is there to

11050.16 --> 11057.84
like catch the Dust

11054.399 --> 11061.88
catch the dust to catch the toxins and

11057.84 --> 11064.6
then it the hair is inside of your lungs

11061.88 --> 11067.56
through vibration make the FL go back up

11064.6 --> 11069.239
and that's what you cough out then so

11067.56 --> 11072.519999999999
it's part of the process you're that's

11069.239 --> 11074.52
supposed to happen and if you have more

11072.52 --> 11078.359
Dusty environment you're like working in

11074.52 --> 11079.84
a mine or you do smoke regularly then

11078.359 --> 11082.640000000001
you're going to have a little bit more

11079.84 --> 11086.479
of that that's only natural coughing

11082.64 --> 11089.72
however especially regularly that's not

11086.479 --> 11093.438999999998
natural that's not natural as a

11089.72 --> 11095.519999999999
smoker that's a bad sign that means that

11093.439 --> 11098.12
there's something agitated there's a

11095.52 --> 11100.68
light inflammation situation which is

11098.12 --> 11103.6
not good like when you are have

11100.68 --> 11106.439
inflammation anywhere like oh you have a

11103.6 --> 11110.76
inflammation in your knee or in your arm

11106.439 --> 11113.880000000001
or in your sinuses or something

11110.76 --> 11116.92
smoking not so good

11113.88 --> 11118.92
then that doesn't really inflammation

11116.92 --> 11121.399
and smoking don't really work all that

11118.92 --> 11123.479
well together in any form so if you're

11121.399 --> 11125.399
like coughing and you keep smoking that

11123.479 --> 11127.72
that's like you're just bumping your

11125.399 --> 11129.0
head against the wall and then wondering

11127.72 --> 11131.88
why you're getting a

11129.0 --> 11134.439
headache yeah that's just bad

11131.88 --> 11137.358999999999
behavior that's just you not having

11134.439 --> 11138.52
control over your impulses and

11137.359 --> 11141.479000000001
understanding with your Consciousness

11138.52 --> 11144.319000000001
what it actually is that you're

11141.479 --> 11146.438999999998
doing so yeah a lot of people that do

11144.319 --> 11148.439
smoke they smoke so automated they don't

11146.439 --> 11150.399
know what they're doing they're like I'm

11148.439 --> 11152.720000000001
coughing smoke

11150.399 --> 11154.319
somewhere and they just keep doing it

11152.72 --> 11155.64
because they just don't think about what

11154.319 --> 11158.64
it is that they're doing and how they're

11155.64 --> 11160.399
doing it and then they're not thinking

11158.64 --> 11162.68
they just wanting to do something

11160.399 --> 11166.16
automated so that you don't actively

11162.68 --> 11170.16
consciously think in that moment that is

11166.16 --> 11172.64
the problem that's causing those side

11170.16 --> 11175.479
effects that you're not thinking and

11172.64 --> 11177.68
balancing out what you're doing that is

11175.479 --> 11179.319
then leading to problems heaping up

11177.68 --> 11182.279
because you're basically

11179.319 --> 11184.6
not taking conscious responsibility of

11182.279 --> 11184.6
what you're

11185.6 --> 11190.08
doing and then you'll get like a

11187.52 --> 11190.08
smoker's

11198.399 --> 11205.199999999999
cough smoker's lung looks black I'm sure

11202.16 --> 11205.2
it does

11208.96 --> 11213.08
I mean yeah you're getting continual

11210.68 --> 11215.68
smoke in there it's going to have an

11213.08 --> 11216.92
effect but did you also know that

11215.68 --> 11220.279
smoker's

11216.92 --> 11223.399
lung if you don't like if you build it

11220.279 --> 11227.76
down and then you stop smoking for like

11223.399 --> 11231.479
a decade it goes right back to

11227.76 --> 11234.72
normal the black goes away

11231.479 --> 11238.8
again it does

11234.72 --> 11241.519999999999
cuz all the lung tissue is all absorbing

11238.8 --> 11244.679999999998
the toxins it's getting and then

11241.52 --> 11247.439
transforming it and there might even be

11244.68 --> 11250.12
like scar tissue because of that to some

11247.439 --> 11252.68
degree if you like got really bad

11250.12 --> 11254.76
sometimes if you like inhale hot smoke

11252.68 --> 11257.319
like really bad hot smoke sometime for

11254.76 --> 11259.84
example if you're in a fire in the house

11257.319 --> 11262.278999999999
that can happen yeah it's damaging but

11259.84 --> 11265.64
it's all going to fix itself just as

11262.279 --> 11268.640000000001
like oh no no I got a cut here ah oh

11265.64 --> 11271.278999999999
it's closing up okay oh there's a scar

11268.64 --> 11275.439
here a damn it oh wait the Scar's gone
