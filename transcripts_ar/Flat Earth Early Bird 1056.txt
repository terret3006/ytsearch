157.44 --> 162.04
the 30th of october 2021

167.12 --> 170.84
how are you all doing

170.92 --> 176.16
stupid fly

173.2 --> 176.16
just insists

176.8 --> 180.64000000000001
it's constantly sitting on my monitor

178.72 --> 183.959
because it's warm

180.64 --> 183.95899999999997
very annoying

187.12 --> 189.519
anyway

196.959 --> 201.519
right so yesterday was

199.84 --> 204.4
interesting

201.519 --> 204.4
day overall

205.599 --> 210.0
i went to bed

207.12 --> 213.4
nice and early so i feel

210.0 --> 213.4
very rested

219.12 --> 227.12
and yeah got a lot of energy right now

222.319 --> 229.92
could also be that it basically is

227.12 --> 232.799
yeah i kept on watching i had to catch

229.92 --> 235.35999999999999
up with owen benjamin

232.799 --> 237.59900000000002
because it kind of skipped the stream

235.36 --> 240.0
and yeah did a little marathon it was

237.599 --> 240.79899999999998
really good

240.0 --> 244.879
so

240.799 --> 244.87900000000002
maybe that boosted my spirits too

249.12 --> 253.84
uh right but yesterday were some

251.68 --> 255.36
interesting streams earth debates was

253.84 --> 258.639
really good

255.36 --> 261.04
nice and long again

258.639 --> 261.919
kumu virus got in there in the after

261.04 --> 266.12
show

261.919 --> 266.12
been a while oh god

276.8 --> 279.52000000000004
right

277.68 --> 282.88
but

279.52 --> 284.79999999999995
uh let's see

282.88 --> 287.919
yeah mitchell from australia had a good

284.8 --> 290.08
stream redfield philosophy got on it

287.919 --> 291.75899999999996
with him this time

290.08 --> 295.03999999999996
haven't seen him in a while apparently

291.759 --> 298.56
still very active on rockfin was it no

295.04 --> 298.56
it wasn't rockfin wait uh

299.04 --> 305.12
what's the other thing again

302.16 --> 305.12
oh yeah odyssey

307.28 --> 311.55999999999995
so he's doing odyssey now

317.36 --> 323.039
slum virus comes in the after show

320.56 --> 325.039
always against yeah yeah yeah well so he

323.039 --> 328.84
definitely did

325.039 --> 328.84
this time again

338.88 --> 344.0
and yeah he was his typical self

342.639 --> 347.759
just

344.0 --> 347.759
invasive and we called him out

350.08 --> 355.12
big time

353.12 --> 357.68
and you would just have the whole like

355.12 --> 360.8
hahahahaha so funny it's so funny how

357.68 --> 360.8
i'm being humiliated

360.96 --> 365.68
yeah it's very annoying

363.84 --> 367.35999999999996
but uh

365.68 --> 369.919
yeah that happened

367.36 --> 369.91900000000004
let's see

372.56 --> 378.08
yeah jim bob did another stream that was

375.759 --> 378.08000000000004
great

379.12 --> 384.08
yeah kind of simultaneously

381.44 --> 385.759
but i ended up watching both at the same

384.08 --> 390.4
time

385.759 --> 390.40000000000003
oh my god this stupid little fly

393.28 --> 398.96
uh let's see what else

397.12 --> 399.68
i think that was pretty much it after

398.96 --> 401.75899999999996
that

399.68 --> 404.759
i just watched owen benjamin on bit

401.759 --> 404.759
shoot

411.44 --> 418.479
and yeah another weird synchronicity

414.08 --> 418.479
right so the day that i did my whole

418.56 --> 422.759
gay rant show

423.599 --> 427.12
remember that

424.96 --> 428.79999999999995
apparently like

427.12 --> 432.4
let's see

428.8 --> 432.40000000000003
yeah the next day on benjamin

433.36 --> 438.08000000000004
that theme

435.599 --> 440.88
that i didn't like oh

438.08 --> 442.71999999999997
let's do this theme today right no i

440.88 --> 447.52
didn't do that no

442.72 --> 447.52000000000004
i just felt like that i got really rowdy

448.0 --> 454.56
and then suddenly that theme

451.44 --> 455.919
somehow echoed on beyond in the rest of

454.56 --> 458.88
the world

455.919 --> 460.479
like a lot

458.88 --> 462.479
now that's the type of freaky

460.479 --> 464.71999999999997
synchronicity

462.479 --> 465.75899999999996
that i was trying to explain yesterday

464.72 --> 468.72
like

465.759 --> 468.72
that's crazy

469.039 --> 472.15999999999997
i do something like that and then

471.039 --> 474.4
literally

472.16 --> 477.44
other things start like taking on that

474.4 --> 478.71999999999997
theme all of a sudden

477.44 --> 480.639
now yeah

478.72 --> 481.759
you can't really blame me

480.639 --> 484.40000000000003
if i then

481.759 --> 487.28000000000003
just feel like what did i do that

484.4 --> 491.12
why did i precede

487.28 --> 493.52
the wave like that did i throw a rock

491.12 --> 497.52
in the water did it ripple

493.52 --> 497.52
because it damn well feels like it

502.479 --> 505.479
anyway

507.28 --> 510.28
hmm

522.88 --> 525.88
uh

536.48 --> 539.279
man

538.56 --> 541.92
uh

539.279 --> 541.92
right so

542.64 --> 548.76
right i didn't have any specific themes

544.959 --> 548.76
in mind today

549.76 --> 555.68
but yeah i'll probably come up with one

553.04 --> 555.68
as i go

559.04 --> 564.3199999999999
right so yeah yesterday stream

561.519 --> 566.16
i think was really good i haven't

564.32 --> 567.519
watched it back and i'm almost kind of

566.16 --> 569.4399999999999
sorry

567.519 --> 572.64
because i remember i put down a whole

569.44 --> 572.6400000000001
bunch of esoterics

572.72 --> 577.0400000000001
and when it gets that complicated i

574.64 --> 580.72
really should watch it all back

577.04 --> 584.16
to see what actually came out

580.72 --> 584.1600000000001
because when i do it

585.04 --> 588.399
i

586.16 --> 590.88
receive it in a certain way i get a

588.399 --> 592.24
certain view while i'm doing it

590.88 --> 595.2
and then

592.24 --> 597.76
yeah when i watch it back it's often

595.2 --> 600.0
different and i need to keep track of

597.76 --> 600.0
that

600.8 --> 604.4799999999999
because yeah there's a whole bunch of

602.24 --> 607.6
things that i think

604.48 --> 609.6800000000001
that i'm thinking and feeling

607.6 --> 610.72
while i do those things

609.68 --> 613.3599999999999
that

610.72 --> 615.6800000000001
i don't necessarily mention i sort of

613.36 --> 617.279
take it for granted and then i kind of

615.68 --> 620.64
hope

617.279 --> 623.36
that through the esoterics other people

620.64 --> 624.959
automatically stumble upon it in their

623.36 --> 627.12
own minds

624.959 --> 630.7199999999999
right

627.12 --> 630.72
it's the fractal thinking thing

631.04 --> 636.64
and it's very kind of you know if i want

633.2 --> 639.6
to be if i want to stay good at it

636.64 --> 641.12
become even better i need to observe

639.6 --> 642.64
myself

641.12 --> 645.44
when i do it

642.64 --> 647.68
to see what's actually coming out

645.44 --> 648.9590000000001
because yeah if it all fits in my mind

647.68 --> 652.0
that's great

648.959 --> 654.8
and i can keep that stable

652.0 --> 658.16
but if i don't actually communicate it

654.8 --> 659.68
properly then it's not effective

658.16 --> 662.3199999999999
and that's why i really should keep

659.68 --> 662.3199999999999
track of it

663.68 --> 667.16
hey mike sudenich

674.079 --> 678.7199999999999
right

675.92 --> 681.36
also sean hawkins got really triggered

678.72 --> 684.5600000000001
yesterday first he started to

681.36 --> 684.5600000000001
complain stream

684.64 --> 689.68
review stream mitchell from australia

688.24 --> 691.36
and started like

689.68 --> 693.1999999999999
screwing around with the sex thing to

691.36 --> 695.279
get like he's never going to give up and

693.2 --> 697.519
his complete waste of time

695.279 --> 699.36
like sean hawkins is big waste of time i

697.519 --> 702.0
feel kind of stupid even

699.36 --> 704.72
mentioning him

702.0 --> 706.959
i think it would be

704.72 --> 709.6
better if i just wouldn't

706.959 --> 711.3599999999999
but yeah he he for some reason got

709.6 --> 714.24
really triggered

711.36 --> 716.16
when i yesterday at some point

714.24 --> 718.16
like choked on my own spittle and then

716.16 --> 720.399
coughed like in the middle of talking

718.16 --> 722.48
and that was weird so he thought it was

720.399 --> 725.36
really cool

722.48 --> 728.5600000000001
to make a 10 minute loop of that

725.36 --> 730.8000000000001
oh so special oh

728.56 --> 731.5999999999999
yeah that's called distracting

730.8 --> 734.56
right

731.6 --> 736.639
i feel that sean typically does that

734.56 --> 738.8
when i roll out information that he

736.639 --> 741.6800000000001
cannot handle and then he seeks for one

738.8 --> 744.079
little thing and then tries to make that

741.68 --> 745.8389999999999
override everything else it's what sean

744.079 --> 748.079
does

745.839 --> 749.0400000000001
because sean is a person that

748.079 --> 751.519
really

749.04 --> 753.1999999999999
doesn't want to understand reality he

751.519 --> 755.839
doesn't want it

753.2 --> 757.519
he wants everybody to shut up and just

755.839 --> 758.8000000000001
echo his

757.519 --> 762.399
stupid

758.8 --> 766.079
handed down dreams

762.399 --> 768.0
and then when somebody breaks that dream

766.079 --> 769.92
right in front of him

768.0 --> 773.12
because he does watch this show for some

769.92 --> 775.04
reason he still does

773.12 --> 776.5600000000001
and then he finds the one moment that's

775.04 --> 778.399
kind of like

776.56 --> 779.8389999999999
that's breaking

778.399 --> 782.399
the flow

779.839 --> 785.5600000000001
and then he wants to overemphasize that

782.399 --> 785.56
it's typical

788.959 --> 791.3599999999999
anyway

795.279 --> 801.519
so what are you guys up to

799.12 --> 803.92
i'm up for talking about pretty much

801.519 --> 805.6
anything i feel very strong i'm not

803.92 --> 808.56
going to get over stressed today i'm

805.6 --> 808.5600000000001
very sure about it

813.12 --> 817.6
and i don't know maybe i could do pretty

815.2 --> 821.0
long stream even

817.6 --> 821.0
it is saturday

833.92 --> 838.4799999999999
put another video out

836.639 --> 839.839
four or five yeah yeah that's the one

838.48 --> 843.04
i'm talking about

839.839 --> 846.72
like it's just two ten minute loop of me

843.04 --> 846.7199999999999
coughing it's really stupid

847.12 --> 850.32
like my god

851.279 --> 858.56
i i don't even wanna point out anymore

854.0 --> 858.56
like how or why that is stupid it's

865.519 --> 871.24
house work

867.12 --> 871.24
stone monkey 3d what

892.0 --> 896.24
right so yeah somebody hand me something

894.32 --> 898.5600000000001
that i could talk about

896.24 --> 902.639
because i got plenty of energy but i

898.56 --> 902.6389999999999
don't have like a whole theme ready

906.079 --> 912.279
better check that's not what you have

908.72 --> 912.279
seen what

916.959 --> 921.04
you me okay so he had another video

919.839 --> 922.48
after that

921.04 --> 925.04
because that

922.48 --> 927.279
meant i got this mentioned from i don't

925.04 --> 930.48
can't even turn that off

927.279 --> 932.0
turn off this type of update yeah

930.48 --> 935.12
okay you can

932.0 --> 935.12
but he did more

936.079 --> 940.8
i don't know

938.0 --> 943.04
i don't exactly like visit his channel

940.8 --> 943.04
so

949.92 --> 954.639
okay so what what about mike's doing

952.24 --> 956.8
that you've awfully obviously watched it

954.639 --> 959.36
so what is it about because i don't

956.8 --> 961.3599999999999
really want to like oh let's go to sean

959.36 --> 964.24
hawkins channel

961.36 --> 964.24
i don't it's

966.72 --> 971.36
it's a a perfect waste of time really

978.88 --> 985.519
but yeah what was it about what did he

981.519 --> 985.519
just review my entire stream

989.92 --> 993.12
can you sum it up for me

994.399 --> 1000.0
i mean it's sean hawkins so it should be

996.56 --> 1000.0
very easy to do that

1000.079 --> 1004.56
most of his activities no matter how

1002.079 --> 1009.079
long can simply be summarized in like

1004.56 --> 1009.079
100 characters very easily

1015.6 --> 1019.519
something about what i see yeah no [ __ ]

1018.16 --> 1023.7199999999999
but what

1019.519 --> 1023.72
what exactly mike's adolescence

1047.199 --> 1050.52
hello crockett

1073.52 --> 1078.6399999999999

what what do i think about robskevan

1180.88 --> 1185.2800000000002
chris well i have many thoughts about

1183.28 --> 1187.44
christianity especially and i've

1185.28 --> 1188.48
discussed that

1187.44 --> 1190.4
a lot

1188.48 --> 1193.1200000000001
in the last

1190.4 --> 1195.3600000000001
months

1193.12 --> 1195.36
right

1198.799 --> 1203.9189999999999
now as for rob skiba that's yeah it's

1201.52 --> 1206.24
more limited i think he was a good guy i

1203.919 --> 1207.679
think he was sensitive i also think that

1206.24 --> 1211.2
he

1207.679 --> 1211.2
had a moment of weakness

1212.64 --> 1217.7990000000002
your nurses are what okay mike sadinick

1222.24 --> 1226.08
jeff

1223.679 --> 1226.0800000000002
daughter

1229.84 --> 1236.8799999999999
okay classical home homeopath well link

1232.72 --> 1236.88
him up link up his channel

1237.52 --> 1241.08
i'll take a look

1252.87 --> 1255.9299999999998
[Music]

1269.679 --> 1272.96
something fishy

1271.679 --> 1275.1200000000001
wearing

1272.96 --> 1277.3600000000001
and selling masks

1275.12 --> 1279.6
yeah yeah that was a problem he did do

1277.36 --> 1279.6
that

1282.08 --> 1285.96
ah okay rockfin

1312.88 --> 1315.88
hmm

1320.4 --> 1322.72
okay

1323.12 --> 1329.559
right yeah

1324.4 --> 1329.5590000000002
or just glancing over it seems

1334.4 --> 1338.919
like it could be halfway interesting

1367.84 --> 1371.24
an indoctrinate

1371.97 --> 1376.24
[Music]

1374.48 --> 1378.559
right so he's he's

1376.24 --> 1381.76
straight on about dispelling is he like

1378.559 --> 1385.36
a lot about mind control and how to

1381.76 --> 1385.36
spot a spell and undo it

1386.0 --> 1389.0
hmm

1394.32 --> 1400.799
he says christian truthers are impacting

1397.28 --> 1403.84
flat oh so he is a flat earther

1400.799 --> 1403.84
he is

1404.159 --> 1410.5590000000002
it's not like blatantly apparent

1408.0 --> 1413.76
not seeing any flat earth models or

1410.559 --> 1413.76
direct references

1415.28 --> 1421.44
oh wait

1417.039 --> 1421.44
flat tober fest exposed

1422.48 --> 1424.799
what

1425.36 --> 1427.76
weird

1427.919 --> 1434.88
yeah i see a whole bunch of rob skiba so

1431.2 --> 1434.88
i guess he really didn't like him

1436.08 --> 1439.08
right

1444.799 --> 1448.4
so he's anti-yeah but what does that

1446.72 --> 1451.76
mean

1448.4 --> 1453.8400000000001
classic homeopath what does that mean

1451.76 --> 1456.08
exactly

1453.84 --> 1460.8799999999999
i mean is he anti-churchian

1456.08 --> 1462.08
is he anti the obviously

1460.88 --> 1462.88
like

1462.08 --> 1464.72
the

1462.88 --> 1467.3600000000001
the church

1464.72 --> 1470.64
actions that obviously contradict

1467.36 --> 1474.799
christ's teachings is he anti-church or

1470.64 --> 1477.76
is he really like no it's all nonsense

1474.799 --> 1477.76
it's all made up

1480.0 --> 1483.919
the bible is a flat earth book

1484.159 --> 1488.0800000000002
is

1484.84 --> 1490.32
it it's compatible

1488.08 --> 1491.84
it's certainly not a spinning ball book

1490.32 --> 1493.84
right

1491.84 --> 1497.6399999999999
but

1493.84 --> 1497.6399999999999
yeah that's about it

1510.72 --> 1516.88
so classical homeopath is he like a

1513.6 --> 1519.84
staunch atheist or is he just very

1516.88 --> 1522.48
anti-churchian

1519.84 --> 1525.36
oh spiritual believes in the creator it

1522.48 --> 1528.3600000000001
rejects all of christianity

1525.36 --> 1528.36
okay

1535.2 --> 1539.76
sounds kind of like he's just

1537.679 --> 1541.679
a jew

1539.76 --> 1544.1589999999999
and he kind of looks like it too if you

1541.679 --> 1548.1200000000001
ask me

1544.159 --> 1548.1200000000001
not atheist okay

1558.08 --> 1563.52
maybe a bad topic

1560.0 --> 1563.52
why why is it a bad topic

1568.559 --> 1575.279
i mean it's your favorite

1571.44 --> 1575.279
truther by your own words so

1576.799 --> 1580.08
hello gordzilla

1578.64 --> 1583.44
37

1580.08 --> 1585.84
bingo yeah dude

1583.44 --> 1585.8400000000001
that guy

1587.52 --> 1595.279
looks like exactly

1591.36 --> 1596.1589999999999
like a lot of typical jews

1595.279 --> 1599.279
kind of

1596.159 --> 1601.1200000000001
lefty jews or lefty looking jews have

1599.279 --> 1602.96
been looking like in the netherlands

1601.12 --> 1604.1589999999999
even for

1602.96 --> 1606.48
like

1604.159 --> 1607.8400000000001
10 years ago

1606.48 --> 1611.3600000000001
like

1607.84 --> 1613.76
it's just a look it's just like

1611.36 --> 1616.3999999999999
not negative no negative implications

1613.76 --> 1618.8799999999999
but that's a jew

1616.4 --> 1621.039
that's a modern that's how i they

1618.88 --> 1623.5200000000002
typically look

1621.039 --> 1625.279
that's how they dress up

1623.52 --> 1628.32
and he believes in god

1625.279 --> 1629.279
but is anti-christian hmm

1628.32 --> 1632.1589999999999
right

1629.279 --> 1634.32
i mean sorry if that's offensive that i

1632.159 --> 1636.159
draw that conclusion but it's just like

1634.32 --> 1638.6399999999999
that's like the immediate first

1636.159 --> 1642.5590000000002
impression i got and it as a again that

1638.64 --> 1642.5590000000002
doesn't have to be negative

1644.559 --> 1649.559
yeah he is the best

1646.559 --> 1649.559
okay

1654.159 --> 1658.7990000000002
all right so i have nothing against jews

1657.6 --> 1660.48
like that

1658.799 --> 1661.52
radio jews whatever you want to call

1660.48 --> 1664.799
them

1661.52 --> 1667.2
unless they are blatant gatekeepers and

1664.799 --> 1670.399
a lot of them are

1667.2 --> 1673.039
that they insert negativity

1670.399 --> 1675.76
with things that they disapprove of for

1673.039 --> 1675.76
some reason

1676.799 --> 1680.08
i don't like those at all

1680.559 --> 1685.36
but they're not all like that

1683.2 --> 1685.3600000000001
so

1686.08 --> 1690.48
no offense you don't offend me

1688.159 --> 1695.3200000000002
okay classical homeopath i didn't

1690.48 --> 1695.32
necessarily mean offend you personally

1701.6 --> 1705.36
and they are also anti-christian

1704.24 --> 1709.0
yeah

1705.36 --> 1709.0
a lot of them are

1713.52 --> 1715.52
and

1714.48 --> 1717.039
yeah

1715.52 --> 1719.84
some of them actually have

1717.039 --> 1722.96
well-developed reasons for that that

1719.84 --> 1724.9599999999998
synchronize very much with my own right

1722.96 --> 1727.679
but i am

1724.96 --> 1732.24
a eclectic christian so i'm basically

1727.679 --> 1734.64
trying a reformation a very serious

1732.24 --> 1736.799
reformation grassroots reformation that

1734.64 --> 1738.5590000000002
i'm doing it's just me

1736.799 --> 1740.48
and i hope

1738.559 --> 1742.799
i'm doing right

1740.48 --> 1744.24
and that others will kind of follow my

1742.799 --> 1745.76
example

1744.24 --> 1748.24
with their own

1745.76 --> 1751.24
personal christendom

1748.24 --> 1751.24
christendom

1756.159 --> 1760.88
right

1758.32 --> 1762.96
but yeah when it comes to like typical

1760.88 --> 1765.5200000000002
christianity as it's out there now with

1762.96 --> 1768.24
all the the chants and all that yeah i

1765.52 --> 1771.6
oppose that

1768.24 --> 1771.6
i think it's actually

1771.679 --> 1776.919
not christian i think it's like

1773.919 --> 1776.919
spellcraft

1780.96 --> 1787.52
like take yeah taking cover under the

1784.08 --> 1787.52
banner of christianity

1788.48 --> 1793.1200000000001
so

1790.32 --> 1795.9189999999999
yeah i don't know i'll check him out

1793.12 --> 1798.32
after yeah after the show is over

1795.919 --> 1800.48
somewhere today i'll check it out see

1798.32 --> 1802.399
what a stream of this is like oh she's

1800.48 --> 1805.679
very long though

1802.399 --> 1809.559
three hours damn

1805.679 --> 1809.5590000000002
i know all of it

1814.32 --> 1819.52
right if there is anything particular

1817.279 --> 1823.12
of his streams you would

1819.52 --> 1824.799
recommend i watch

1823.12 --> 1828.279
then let me know

1824.799 --> 1828.279
classical homeopath

1848.64 --> 1853.5200000000002
right yeah and concerning the whole

1850.559 --> 1856.96
gatekeeper comment

1853.52 --> 1858.8799999999999
yeah remember again what is a gatekeeper

1856.96 --> 1861.279
right not everybody is a gatekeeper

1858.88 --> 1862.8400000000001
because they don't address subjects

1861.279 --> 1866.32
gatekeeping is

1862.84 --> 1868.32
not not addressing subjects because then

1866.32 --> 1872.08
everybody would be a gatekeeper because

1868.32 --> 1875.519
there are a million things to talk about

1872.08 --> 1877.6
and everybody definitely doesn't address

1875.519 --> 1879.6
absolutely everything

1877.6 --> 1882.24
because of their own abilities their own

1879.6 --> 1883.84
interests see that's not gatekeeping not

1882.24 --> 1887.44
talking about something is not

1883.84 --> 1891.36
gatekeeping actual gatekeeping

1887.44 --> 1893.679
can be identified by

1891.36 --> 1895.9189999999999
negative emphasis

1893.679 --> 1897.679
that certain types of subjects every

1895.919 --> 1901.2
time they're brought up

1897.679 --> 1903.679
like a pavlovian reaction baked in is

1901.2 --> 1905.76
outrage

1903.679 --> 1908.3990000000001
of some kind

1905.76 --> 1911.919
negative negative reinforcement really

1908.399 --> 1913.5189999999998
that's what really makes a gatekeeper

1911.919 --> 1915.8400000000001
whenever something is brought up then

1913.519 --> 1918.64
immediately negative emphasis and like

1915.84 --> 1921.84
get out of here or something right

1918.64 --> 1921.8400000000001
that's typical gatekeeping

1923.279 --> 1929.44
so that people don't learn more about it

1927.6 --> 1931.4399999999998
they don't

1929.44 --> 1933.6000000000001
but they like

1931.44 --> 1935.679
are encouraged even on the subconscious

1933.6 --> 1938.08
level to kind of stay away from it and

1935.679 --> 1939.1200000000001
just view it as bad that is what is

1938.08 --> 1941.1999999999998
typical

1939.12 --> 1944.0
gatekeeping so

1941.2 --> 1944.0
is he like that

1944.48 --> 1951.039
or does he just have elaborate criticism

1948.72 --> 1951.039
see

1952.96 --> 1956.72
because i have elaborate criticism on

1954.96 --> 1959.519
things

1956.72 --> 1963.84
but i don't gate keep it i always try to

1959.519 --> 1963.84
enlighten people as to why

1964.96 --> 1969.88
so they can make up their minds

1966.88 --> 1969.88
themselves

1980.48 --> 1986.48
right so speak up in chat please it's

1983.76 --> 1986.48
five minutes

1987.279 --> 1991.159
don't like it when that happens

2015.36 --> 2018.36
guys

2019.76 --> 2023.0
hello cleary

2047.2 --> 2053.96
hey nigel ian hickson welcome to my chat

2090.48 --> 2096.56
okay classical homeopath thanks

2094.32 --> 2096.56
right

2101.599 --> 2107.119
okay i'll uh i'll judge

2104.32 --> 2109.2000000000003
i'll check out his presentations and see

2107.119 --> 2112.2400000000002
how mind-blowing they actually are i'll

2109.2 --> 2114.8799999999997
see what his talent is

2112.24 --> 2117.52
does he have like a fractal insight does

2114.88 --> 2120.48
he know how to basically

2117.52 --> 2122.48
reduce the situations or elements the

2120.48 --> 2124.96
patterns that are and then easily

2122.48 --> 2129.119
connected so you go to that or does he

2124.96 --> 2130.96
really bring in new more obscure data

2129.119 --> 2135.2000000000003
like yeah there's all kinds of ways

2130.96 --> 2137.44
people can be good in presentations

2135.2 --> 2137.4399999999996
so

2137.599 --> 2142.3590000000004
as i said earlier i'll check it out

2167.76 --> 2172.5600000000004
fractal inside okay okay well then yeah

2170.16 --> 2175.1189999999997
that should be very interesting

2172.56 --> 2178.16
i'm always interested in other people's

2175.119 --> 2178.1600000000003
fractal insights

2182.96 --> 2187.92
right and i'm also gonna spot if he's

2185.28 --> 2190.96
actually gate keeping anything within it

2187.92 --> 2193.44
because that is also a possibility

2190.96 --> 2195.599
it's very hard to tell fractal inside is

2193.44 --> 2198.64
a very delicate thing

2195.599 --> 2200.88
it's very complicated and like elusive

2198.64 --> 2203.2
it's like you can't even normally

2200.88 --> 2204.48
explain it you just have to go through

2203.2 --> 2205.9199999999996
it

2204.48 --> 2207.599
and do it

2205.92 --> 2209.92
but that doesn't mean

2207.599 --> 2212.0
it's always going to be

2209.92 --> 2215.839
whatever is presented is always going to

2212.0 --> 2215.839
be perfectly clear and

2215.92 --> 2222.56
ungate kept because that is possible too

2219.359 --> 2222.56
people do that too

2226.079 --> 2231.8390000000004
they kind of like force the fractal

2228.16 --> 2231.839
inside in a certain direction

2239.599 --> 2243.6800000000003
but anyway

2241.599 --> 2246.32
i'll stop trying to judge it before i've

2243.68 --> 2248.0789999999997
even watched it

2246.32 --> 2250.88
because that usually doesn't turn out

2248.079 --> 2250.88
all that useful

2254.0 --> 2257.92
there's already plenty of people out

2255.52 --> 2260.92
there that do that

2257.92 --> 2260.92
sean

2274.96 --> 2277.96
so

2296.079 --> 2299.079
foreign

2318.72 --> 2321.72
uh

2371.839 --> 2374.839
do

2388.32 --> 2393.839
okay guys look i'm gonna run out the

2391.04 --> 2395.52
show if you don't start talking because

2393.839 --> 2397.359
this is

2395.52 --> 2400.0
quite disappointing i've got all this

2397.359 --> 2403.5989999999997
energy i've got a lot of cohesion and

2400.0 --> 2405.44
strength and literally nobody is

2403.599 --> 2407.44
handing me anything

2405.44 --> 2409.2000000000003
i mean i got the channel i can't do

2407.44 --> 2410.64
anything with that until i've watched

2409.2 --> 2413.5989999999997
something about it

2410.64 --> 2417.1189999999997
unless you start inserting things about

2413.599 --> 2417.119
it that i can work with

2422.24 --> 2425.839
hello from the grave

2426.4 --> 2429.44
hello gaining wisdom

2430.56 --> 2435.04
don't drown out the show yeah but i'm

2432.319 --> 2437.119
not gonna just sit here waiting for five

2435.04 --> 2438.96
minutes until somebody

2437.119 --> 2441.44
brings up something that i can actually

2438.96 --> 2441.44
talk about

2450.839 --> 2456.7999999999997
okay mean there's got to be interaction

2453.52 --> 2456.8
that's how this show works

2458.88 --> 2463.119
do the clocks still go back tonight in

2461.28 --> 2464.96
an oh they do

2463.119 --> 2467.839
huh

2464.96 --> 2467.839
uh

2467.92 --> 2472.48
well i guess i'll find out

2470.16 --> 2476.04
from the grave

2472.48 --> 2476.04
it's all automated

2486.88 --> 2489.76
i mean most of it is

2488.88 --> 2492.1600000000003
like

2489.76 --> 2495.1600000000003
phone and computer time that gets

2492.16 --> 2495.16
automatically

2495.28 --> 2500.8
yeah set to the news and time type

2499.52 --> 2503.119
but

2500.8 --> 2507.48
yeah there's some separate devices that

2503.119 --> 2507.48
don't so i'll find out

2508.24 --> 2512.2
thanks for the early warning

2528.0 --> 2533.92
so right yeah

2531.04 --> 2537.64
what do you want me to talk about

2533.92 --> 2537.64
you got four minutes

2561.2 --> 2565.839
tomorrow night they change okay

2563.44 --> 2565.839
georgetown

2565.92 --> 2569.4
so yeah

2617.04 --> 2623.4
oh jesus

2620.079 --> 2623.4
what's this

2636.079 --> 2640.4
yeah i'm just scrolling through other

2637.68 --> 2640.3999999999996
[ __ ] because

2641.28 --> 2645.6800000000003
this is not really going anywhere like

2643.359 --> 2645.68
this

2647.76 --> 2653.6400000000003
christian contradictions what about them

2650.319 --> 2653.64
which ones

2669.92 --> 2675.52
you've been working too hard worrying

2671.839 --> 2679.16
and working too hard from the grave okay

2675.52 --> 2679.16
yeah take it easy

2690.4 --> 2695.119
do some research so the map can be

2692.56 --> 2695.119
produced

2697.52 --> 2701.7599999999998
well how do you actually achieve that

2700.0 --> 2705.68
moon shadow have you ever

2701.76 --> 2706.6400000000003
considered that right

2705.68 --> 2708.16
i mean

2706.64 --> 2710.64
you need

2708.16 --> 2712.56
a lot of cooperation

2710.64 --> 2714.56
internationally

2712.56 --> 2717.119
to actually get that done

2714.56 --> 2719.68
does it seem like the world right now is

2717.119 --> 2722.4
ready for such operations with

2719.68 --> 2723.7599999999998
everything that's going on right now

2722.4 --> 2725.599
i mean

2723.76 --> 2726.5600000000004
like

2725.599 --> 2728.8
shipping

2726.56 --> 2731.68
issues everywhere

2728.8 --> 2732.88
corporations basically having undergoing

2731.68 --> 2735.52
a

2732.88 --> 2738.96
disease

2735.52 --> 2741.04
like not an actual disease but like

2738.96 --> 2743.2
they are acting diseased they are

2741.04 --> 2745.92
misfunctioning

2743.2 --> 2747.7599999999998
they're forcing forcing poison on their

2745.92 --> 2750.079
workers etc

2747.76 --> 2752.5600000000004
like does it seem like the world is now

2750.079 --> 2754.0
ready like oh yeah flat earthers let's

2752.56 --> 2755.2
make a new map

2754.0 --> 2756.88
uh

2755.2 --> 2759.1189999999997
you think the conditions are right for

2756.88 --> 2762.88
this right now

2759.119 --> 2762.88
doesn't look like it to me

2765.04 --> 2769.04
right because you need access if you

2767.119 --> 2772.96
want to make a map

2769.04 --> 2775.839
world map you need access

2772.96 --> 2775.839
and cooperation

2776.16 --> 2782.48
you need there to be no objections you

2780.079 --> 2782.48
you see

2782.8 --> 2789.8390000000004
good luck with that right now

2785.92 --> 2789.839
can barely get any shipping going

2808.4 --> 2813.839
i mean on the long run it's definitely a

2810.96 --> 2815.68
thing to do i agree with that moonshadow

2813.839 --> 2818.24
but it just doesn't seem like the

2815.68 --> 2821.04
conditions are right

2818.24 --> 2821.04
at this moment

2822.64 --> 2827.2799999999997
do you follow the christian bible or

2825.04 --> 2831.44
just believe in god in gene well not

2827.28 --> 2834.0
little g thanks from the grave

2831.44 --> 2835.2000000000003
the bible is so confusing

2834.0 --> 2837.839
oh

2835.2 --> 2841.2
that depends on your frame of mind

2837.839 --> 2844.319
right the bible is a test it's a test

2841.2 --> 2847.839
of your own connection with god will you

2844.319 --> 2850.88
see what is good and what is evil

2847.839 --> 2853.44
not because people tell you but because

2850.88 --> 2856.44
you sense it

2853.44 --> 2856.44
see

2865.92 --> 2870.2400000000002
and if you don't have the senses

2868.64 --> 2873.839
then

2870.24 --> 2873.839
there's nothing really that can be done

2877.839 --> 2884.0789999999997
then it is just confusing and that's it

2882.16 --> 2887.1189999999997
because then

2884.079 --> 2888.8
from a objective standpoint yeah it

2887.119 --> 2891.599
looks odd look at all the contradictions

2888.8 --> 2894.0
so why does god support these and

2891.599 --> 2896.079
but then punishes another for basically

2894.0 --> 2898.4
wanting to do the same thing etc etc

2896.079 --> 2901.76
yeah yeah yeah that's the point that's

2898.4 --> 2905.44
the test for you to understand

2901.76 --> 2908.7200000000003
the different setups and to know that to

2905.44 --> 2908.7200000000003
know that it is

2908.96 --> 2915.44
contradicting

2910.8 --> 2919.76
that contradiction doesn't undo anything

2915.44 --> 2923.119
it's there for you to sense it to sense

2919.76 --> 2925.5200000000004
to reflect upon the actual

2923.119 --> 2925.52
sense

2925.599 --> 2933.2400000000002
that knows wrong from right

2928.559 --> 2933.2400000000002
that is the entire point

2942.319 --> 2946.0
flat tour no moonshine no

2945.04 --> 2948.4
i do

2946.0 --> 2951.28
i'm not going to the united states or

2948.4 --> 2951.28
anywhere really

2951.359 --> 2956.4
so i don't know i think flattoberfest

2953.92 --> 2959.52
would is just gonna do

2956.4 --> 2959.52
is gonna be what it is

2962.319 --> 2966.24
or i think it already happened didn't it

2968.4 --> 2972.0
i'm not sure it's that's all america

2970.96 --> 2976.839
stuff

2972.0 --> 2976.839
i i have very little to do with that

2986.72 --> 2991.7599999999998
they go to hill those that don't follow

2989.04 --> 2991.7599999999998
the bible no

2994.24 --> 2996.9599999999996
they could

2995.68 --> 2999.1189999999997
right

2996.96 --> 3002.7200000000003
but yeah if you follow the bible that

2999.119 --> 3004.8
doesn't exclude you from going to hell

3002.72 --> 3006.2799999999997
i mean

3004.8 --> 3009.04
it's part of the

3006.28 --> 3010.3190000000004
indoctrination from priesthood that tell

3009.04 --> 3012.319
you that

3010.319 --> 3014.64
that even tell you that you will go

3012.319 --> 3014.64
there

3016.88 --> 3021.6800000000003
right i have a completely different

3019.76 --> 3023.92
observation about hell

3021.68 --> 3027.3999999999996
and heaven because i think it's right

3023.92 --> 3027.4
here right now

3027.839 --> 3032.16
it is

3029.04 --> 3035.119
where our spirit dwells during life

3032.16 --> 3037.52
and whatever happens afterward

3035.119 --> 3040.8
will be revealed one way or another it's

3037.52 --> 3044.72
the only thing you'll ever be able to do

3040.8 --> 3047.6800000000003
with it is trust it or ignore it

3044.72 --> 3047.68
because we don't know

3049.2 --> 3052.8799999999997
is there going to be in the convention

3051.04 --> 3055.599
in amsterdam well not that i've heard of

3052.88 --> 3055.599
moon moonshadow

3056.48 --> 3061.04
like the whole international thing right

3058.48 --> 3064.2
now is a big hassle

3061.04 --> 3064.2
you understand

3068.8 --> 3073.1600000000003
hello steamy traveler by the way

3116.48 --> 3121.44
yeah gloria miller hello by the way iss

3119.599 --> 3124.4
astronauts

3121.44 --> 3126.8
well it's even kind of weird like

3124.4 --> 3129.6800000000003
what is the actual pressure what like

3126.8 --> 3131.44
what is even the official pressure

3129.68 --> 3133.2
around the iss

3131.44 --> 3134.64
what is it official i don't even know

3133.2 --> 3136.64
that

3134.64 --> 3139.64
is it really that deep space vacuum

3136.64 --> 3139.64
already

3140.079 --> 3143.119
i mean

3141.2 --> 3145.4399999999996
even if it was less they're still going

3143.119 --> 3147.92
to be big problems with any supposed

3145.44 --> 3149.44
space suits

3147.92 --> 3151.599
because they're just going to blow up

3149.44 --> 3153.44
the gas inside is going to just expand

3151.599 --> 3155.04
and blow them up like a rigid balloon

3153.44 --> 3157.119
and then you can't even move your arms

3155.04 --> 3158.24
anymore because it's all just

3157.119 --> 3161.6800000000003
rigid

3158.24 --> 3161.68
rigid blown up balloon

3162.24 --> 3166.3999999999996
have i ever traveled to the united

3164.079 --> 3169.44
states of america

3166.4 --> 3170.8
well when i was a baby

3169.44 --> 3172.4
literally

3170.8 --> 3176.52
that happened yeah

3172.4 --> 3176.52
but other than that no

3201.76 --> 3206.2400000000002
why don't the pressure at the bottom of

3204.319 --> 3209.24
ocean crush

3206.24 --> 3209.24
divers

3209.599 --> 3214.96
that seems like a weird question i'm

3211.92 --> 3214.96
pretty sure they do

3220.48 --> 3224.64
but

3221.68 --> 3226.24
if you descent slowly

3224.64 --> 3228.72
your body can

3226.24 --> 3228.72
adapt

3229.2 --> 3234.0789999999997
but like even the gas chemistry

3232.559 --> 3236.559
the breathing situation is going to

3234.079 --> 3240.2400000000002
become different it's weird like you

3236.559 --> 3240.2400000000002
have to have different types of gas

3241.68 --> 3246.24
different concentrations when you go

3243.52 --> 3246.24
down deeper

3246.96 --> 3250.559
right and then if you go really really

3249.44 --> 3252.88
deep

3250.559 --> 3254.4
and you go back up you have to go up

3252.88 --> 3256.2400000000002
slowly

3254.4 --> 3258.319
right

3256.24 --> 3260.64
so yeah if you suddenly dive down like

3258.319 --> 3263.2799999999997
let's just say you get

3260.64 --> 3265.1189999999997
pulled down by a

3263.28 --> 3267.2000000000003
torpedo rocket that goes straight to the

3265.119 --> 3269.76
bottom you get pulled down very quickly

3267.2 --> 3272.72
yeah that's gonna absolutely crush you

3269.76 --> 3275.92
like literally crush you

3272.72 --> 3279.72
but if you go down slowly then you can

3275.92 --> 3279.7200000000003
temporarily adapt

3281.76 --> 3288.1600000000003
some people are better at withstanding

3286.0 --> 3290.559
oceanic pressure

3288.16 --> 3293.44
than others others just simply they

3290.559 --> 3294.799
can't do it

3293.44 --> 3298.119
they just

3294.799 --> 3298.119
they panic

3322.96 --> 3327.68
right stone monkey 3 yeah they have very

3325.119 --> 3330.559
elaborate procedures to

3327.68 --> 3333.5589999999997
make sure that deep sea divers don't get

3330.559 --> 3333.559
hurt

3335.2 --> 3339.9199999999996
because yeah if you're gonna like build

3336.88 --> 3341.52
an oil rig in the middle of the ocean

3339.92 --> 3343.359
yeah guess what it's gonna have to be

3341.52 --> 3345.28
attached to the freaking bottom that

3343.359 --> 3346.96
means that people are going to have to

3345.28 --> 3349.44
actually attach it to the bottom you

3346.96 --> 3352.88
can't just do that all robotically

3349.44 --> 3352.88
and welders and all that

3353.76 --> 3359.6800000000003
so people are gonna go really gonna go

3356.799 --> 3363.16
down really deep in order to

3359.68 --> 3363.16
fix it up

3378.559 --> 3380.799
what

3383.44 --> 3388.359
were you addressing there's gaining

3385.359 --> 3388.359
wisdom

3395.68 --> 3398.68
what

3415.599 --> 3421.6800000000003
oh wait yeah yeah i see it's about your

3417.52 --> 3421.68
earlier statement i don't understand

3424.079 --> 3428.319
if possession is nine tenths of the law

3428.96 --> 3433.119
then if

3430.16 --> 3435.52
it's the mind understanding and knowing

3433.119 --> 3437.76
what that means 10

3435.52 --> 3437.7599999999998
what

3440.96 --> 3447.839
i'm not fully understanding the context

3444.0 --> 3447.839
here gaining wisdom

3452.0 --> 3455.24
low backs

3499.359 --> 3503.44
it's 120 celsius in the sunlight

3501.92 --> 3506.44
supposedly

3503.44 --> 3506.44
really

3516.319 --> 3519.319
huh

3530.48 --> 3535.2
law written on the heart right and wrong

3532.88 --> 3535.2000000000003
right

3535.52 --> 3540.799
well that again that's a good tie-in

3538.319 --> 3543.2
point with what i said earlier about the

3540.799 --> 3543.2
bible

3543.599 --> 3548.96
it's there for you to recognize what is

3546.079 --> 3551.52
right or wrong because we have a

3548.96 --> 3554.96
built in sense you could you could

3551.52 --> 3558.48
almost call it the god sense

3554.96 --> 3560.799
ah sense of truth and lies right and

3558.48 --> 3560.799
wrong

3564.96 --> 3567.599
and

3566.24 --> 3570.799
yeah

3567.599 --> 3573.28
that sense if you have it applies to all

3570.799 --> 3575.68
things right you don't need a piece of

3573.28 --> 3577.3590000000004
paper being written out to you

3575.68 --> 3579.52
in order to

3577.359 --> 3581.839
conform

3579.52 --> 3583.28
you'll naturally if you have that sense

3581.839 --> 3585.599
and you have it well developed and you

3583.28 --> 3588.96
respect it and you cherish it you'll

3585.599 --> 3592.0
probably be acting

3588.96 --> 3595.599
under the law naturally and you won't

3592.0 --> 3600.16
even have to know the law you see

3595.599 --> 3602.079
if the laws are constructed correctly

3600.16 --> 3606.3999999999996
they actually abide

3602.079 --> 3606.4
by right and wrong by the by nature

3609.92 --> 3615.04
and if they don't then as you go about

3612.799 --> 3617.04
naturally

3615.04 --> 3619.119
then you get into trouble and be like oh

3617.04 --> 3620.48
you just broke the law

3619.119 --> 3622.0
you did better than that

3620.48 --> 3624.319
this and that

3622.0 --> 3626.24
and then yeah you'll naturally object

3624.319 --> 3628.799
it's like yeah that's like

3626.24 --> 3631.359
that's like bureaucracy

3628.799 --> 3633.04
that's just autocracy

3631.359 --> 3635.5989999999997
it's wrong

3633.04 --> 3637.52
because it's not natural

3635.599 --> 3640.0
and while you act naturally you bump

3637.52 --> 3641.44
into it and yeah that means it's not

3640.0 --> 3643.2
natural

3641.44 --> 3645.28
that's how you know like this is

3643.2 --> 3649.64
nonsense bureaucracy this is just power

3645.28 --> 3649.6400000000003
playing this is to intimidate

3685.44 --> 3690.319
12 minutes to get down 15 hours to a

3688.4 --> 3692.64
cent that's

3690.319 --> 3692.64
wow

3693.599 --> 3701.44
damn 15 hours in the water god

3698.72 --> 3704.799
that's a long damn time man

3701.44 --> 3704.799
george sanford that's crazy

3708.48 --> 3715.52
was i into alternative stuff as a young

3711.04 --> 3715.52
person no i was a total

3715.839 --> 3720.0789999999997
societalist

3718.4 --> 3722.88
i would

3720.079 --> 3725.3590000000004
i was a slave to convenience and trusted

3722.88 --> 3727.2000000000003
everything it's like oh yeah candy

3725.359 --> 3730.5589999999997
candy from the machine

3727.2 --> 3730.5589999999997
coca-cola all that

3731.68 --> 3734.48
because i thought like yeah if they sell

3733.68 --> 3736.96
it

3734.48 --> 3738.64
then it must be all right because if

3736.96 --> 3739.52
it's bad for you they would get into

3738.64 --> 3743.2
trouble

3739.52 --> 3743.2
that's what i thought as a young person

3743.76 --> 3748.88
so i ate all my msg chips

3747.68 --> 3750.72
high

3748.88 --> 3754.119
sugar

3750.72 --> 3754.1189999999997
fizzy drinks

3755.76 --> 3759.6800000000003
i indulged a lot as a kid

3761.039 --> 3766.1600000000003
but yeah then

3763.76 --> 3768.88
my parents kind of did encourage like

3766.16 --> 3771.0389999999998
natural food and all that

3768.88 --> 3772.7200000000003
so my dinners were on average were kind

3771.039 --> 3776.2400000000002
of good

3772.72 --> 3778.3999999999996
a lot of like home cooking

3776.24 --> 3780.4799999999996
and we did have like vegetables and

3778.4 --> 3783.48
especially a lot of fruits from our own

3780.48 --> 3783.48
garden

3783.92 --> 3790.48
but yeah my interest in organic food

3788.319 --> 3792.079
came much later really

3790.48 --> 3793.359
i was always kind of like yeah that's a

3792.079 --> 3796.559
good idea

3793.359 --> 3799.0389999999998
it's just not what i really care about

3796.559 --> 3799.039
until

3800.48 --> 3809.52
at some point i started to wake up

3804.96 --> 3813.839
at the start thanks to alex jones

3809.52 --> 3816.88
and yeah precursors to that

3813.839 --> 3820.4
and then i figured out like oh [ __ ]

3816.88 --> 3823.039
i really have to like not indulge ever

3820.4 --> 3826.2400000000002
again because i was already physically

3823.039 --> 3827.44
feeling it wearing on me it was

3826.24 --> 3829.5989999999997
like i'm

3827.44 --> 3832.2400000000002
on average you'd be surprised but i'm on

3829.599 --> 3834.48
average a lot healthier right now than i

3832.24 --> 3837.7599999999998
was 20 years ago

3834.48 --> 3839.92
when i didn't eat organic yet

3837.76 --> 3842.079
i just was like oh i'm young i can

3839.92 --> 3844.64
handle anything well guess what no no

3842.079 --> 3844.6400000000003
you can't

3848.96 --> 3855.2
did i hang around with other youths

3851.599 --> 3855.2000000000003
that's such a weird thing to say

3857.2 --> 3860.16
but

3858.799 --> 3863.92
no i was

3860.16 --> 3866.3999999999996
mostly solitary as a kid

3863.92 --> 3868.7200000000003
i really yeah didn't have too many

3866.4 --> 3872.7200000000003
friends i hung around with but the ones

3868.72 --> 3872.72
that i did i hung around with a lot

3874.64 --> 3878.839
like often playing video games or just

3877.359 --> 3880.799
goofing around

3878.839 --> 3884.0
outside

3880.799 --> 3885.28
like climbing trees and [ __ ]

3884.0 --> 3887.76
or yeah

3885.28 --> 3890.2400000000002
getting in trouble

3887.76 --> 3892.6400000000003
doing stupid things nagging

3890.24 --> 3892.64
people

3892.799 --> 3895.839
just kid stuff

3900.079 --> 3904.96
but i didn't typically hang around in

3902.24 --> 3907.0389999999998
big groups at all

3904.96 --> 3909.599
because i didn't like it i didn't i've

3907.039 --> 3911.44
never liked it because everybody just

3909.599 --> 3914.799
sinks into that

3911.44 --> 3918.0
group spirit they lose themselves and if

3914.799 --> 3920.24
you're lucky they like attain a group

3918.0 --> 3921.76
task for themselves so they're like okay

3920.24 --> 3923.839
i am the scout

3921.76 --> 3925.8390000000004
nobody has to say that they just start

3923.839 --> 3927.68
doing it's like okay i'm in a group i'm

3925.839 --> 3929.7599999999998
gonna look around and then there's those

3927.68 --> 3932.48
that are like oh i'm gonna be

3929.76 --> 3934.559
the tough guy to make everybody feel

3932.48 --> 3937.68
good about themselves or something right

3934.559 --> 3941.3590000000004
so people take on group functions

3937.68 --> 3943.7599999999998
but then they kind of lose their typical

3941.359 --> 3946.88
critical thought consciousness

3943.76 --> 3950.559
and that's always the part that i appeal

3946.88 --> 3954.7200000000003
to so i never liked big groups

3950.559 --> 3954.7200000000003
because i just can't do anything in him

3957.44 --> 3962.48
yeah i've hung around with a lot of

3959.92 --> 3962.48
nerds

3963.839 --> 3968.96
at some point a couple of jews

3967.119 --> 3971.96
and i thought they were actually really

3968.96 --> 3971.96
interesting

3986.24 --> 3990.8799999999997
are you good at drawing graffiti yeah no

3990.96 --> 3998.559
no i don't do graffiti

3993.839 --> 4001.119
there is some good gravity graffiti

3998.559 --> 4001.119
here and there

4003.2 --> 4007.4399999999996
but yeah

4004.319 --> 4009.52
then it's kind of like painting

4007.44 --> 4011.68
but i'm not typically a fan i don't like

4009.52 --> 4011.68
it

4013.52 --> 4017.119
i

4014.72 --> 4020.1189999999997
surprise surprise kind of like clean

4017.119 --> 4020.119
walls

4020.16 --> 4026.5589999999997
i'm not a big fan of like oh it's a

4022.72 --> 4028.9599999999996
canvas let's blurt it all in

4026.559 --> 4032.1600000000003
everything has to be a painting no

4028.96 --> 4033.28
i actually hate that

4032.16 --> 4035.5989999999997
i'm not

4033.28 --> 4037.76
like philosophically opposed to it it's

4035.599 --> 4039.6800000000003
just that i personally don't like that i

4037.76 --> 4042.88
don't like to be in an environment like

4039.68 --> 4044.72
that because it makes my mind restless

4042.88 --> 4047.7200000000003
and it's already restless enough by

4044.72 --> 4047.72
itself

4054.16 --> 4057.839
okay

4055.68 --> 4059.9199999999996
moonshadow what

4057.839 --> 4062.88
what is picket fence i don't even know

4059.92 --> 4064.319
what white picket fence is

4062.88 --> 4066.079
at all

4064.319 --> 4068.24
but did i want to get married and have

4066.079 --> 4072.0
kids yeah

4068.24 --> 4074.16
but i never really knew how to do it

4072.0 --> 4076.96
and for some reason i've always been

4074.16 --> 4079.2799999999997
attracted to girls that for bloody

4076.96 --> 4081.839
reason didn't want that

4079.28 --> 4085.3590000000004
or didn't want it on me right i've had a

4081.839 --> 4087.599
lot of like discouraging

4085.359 --> 4090.839
that again yeah i haven't always been

4087.599 --> 4090.839
like the

4091.68 --> 4096.0
yeah the most exemplary man

4096.08 --> 4101.5199999999995
like that when i was younger

4098.239 --> 4101.5199999999995
just didn't understand it

4102.719 --> 4108.2390000000005
so yeah i missed the boat on a lot and i

4105.44 --> 4110.4
regret it a lot like with every

4108.239 --> 4112.08
ex-girlfriend

4110.4 --> 4114.4
every girlfriend i ever fell in love

4112.08 --> 4117.64
with i wanted to actually have children

4114.4 --> 4117.639999999999
with them

4120.159 --> 4126.2789999999995
because otherwise i

4122.319 --> 4126.279
i don't fall in love

4152.88 --> 4158.400000000001
i want to have a house with my own small

4155.04 --> 4158.4
hydroponics firm okay

4159.52 --> 4164.159000000001
yeah well i want to have a house with a

4161.679 --> 4165.279
a a small

4164.159 --> 4167.92
by

4165.279 --> 4169.4400000000005
worldly standards a small garden

4167.92 --> 4171.679
and that would be great

4169.44 --> 4173.2789999999995
small kind of big

4171.679 --> 4176.319
i don't know it doesn't have to i don't

4173.279 --> 4178.0
have to have like land

4176.319 --> 4178.96
because that would probably be too much

4178.0 --> 4181.279
for me

4178.96 --> 4182.56
or at least for starters

4181.279 --> 4184.4800000000005
but just a

4182.56 --> 4186.719
a a decent

4184.48 --> 4188.879999999999
what is even decent right that differs

4186.719 --> 4191.44
for people per person

4188.88 --> 4192.799
but just a

4191.44 --> 4194.879999999999
a garden

4192.799 --> 4199.159
in which i could grow some plants

4194.88 --> 4199.159000000001
including cannabis yeah sure

4211.44 --> 4213.759999999999
what

4213.92 --> 4218.84
what are you saying gaining wisdom i

4215.6 --> 4218.84
don't understand

4231.199 --> 4236.5599999999995
do i keep in touch with any of my

4234.0 --> 4239.12
ex-girlfriends

4236.56 --> 4239.120000000001
sorta

4243.44 --> 4249.44
but yeah the thing is

4246.48 --> 4251.04
i've changed a lot

4249.44 --> 4253.199
like a lot

4251.04 --> 4253.199
so

4253.92 --> 4258.0
weirdly enough all the ex-girlfriends

4256.239 --> 4258.879999999999
that i wanted to have children with

4258.0 --> 4261.36
really

4258.88 --> 4264.32
they all have children

4261.36 --> 4264.32
with somebody else

4265.36 --> 4270.159
except well my ex

4267.679 --> 4272.719
that would be crazy if she i would be

4270.159 --> 4275.36
savagely insulted if she actually got a

4272.719 --> 4278.719
child now because that seemed to be the

4275.36 --> 4279.679
primary reason she even broke up with me

4278.719 --> 4281.76
because i

4279.679 --> 4284.0
really did want that

4281.76 --> 4287.84
and i actually came out for that

4284.0 --> 4287.84
and she really didn't

4287.92 --> 4290.4800000000005
but

4288.96 --> 4292.2390000000005
yeah my first

4290.48 --> 4294.239
real girlfriend

4292.239 --> 4296.159
she has a kid

4294.239 --> 4298.5599999999995
for a while

4296.159 --> 4300.48
and i like she

4298.56 --> 4304.400000000001
came by one time

4300.48 --> 4304.4
and that's now like four years ago

4306.0 --> 4312.48
and so yeah i'm in friendly contact with

4308.719 --> 4315.6
her but she is

4312.48 --> 4318.799999999999
like a fanatical atheist not evil but

4315.6 --> 4320.96
fanatically atheist

4318.8 --> 4323.6
like she has no

4320.96 --> 4326.08
no sympathy or room for any of that she

4323.6 --> 4327.84
has no connection

4326.08 --> 4331.36
and that was kind of like even my

4327.84 --> 4331.360000000001
original fascination because

4331.92 --> 4336.159
well yeah complicated reasons

4337.44 --> 4340.799999999999
but

4338.64 --> 4343.52
yeah and then there's like my third

4340.8 --> 4346.2390000000005
third girlfriend that was also very

4343.52 --> 4346.2390000000005
serious to me

4347.28 --> 4354.159
she also has like multiple kids

4351.04 --> 4354.159
living in amsterdam

4355.199 --> 4360.32
but yeah we don't really

4358.64 --> 4363.6
share much

4360.32 --> 4366.159
our our relation was mostly about just

4363.6 --> 4368.08
like physical like we were just really

4366.159 --> 4369.839999999999
physically attracted to one another so

4368.08 --> 4372.08
it was more like the unspoken

4369.84 --> 4374.400000000001
relationship where like she felt safe

4372.08 --> 4375.36
with me i felt really like a man with

4374.4 --> 4378.32
her

4375.36 --> 4381.04
but as for the communication

4378.32 --> 4383.04
there was just like a lot of things that

4381.04 --> 4385.6
we just

4383.04 --> 4387.84
like we constantly misunderstand each

4385.6 --> 4387.84
other

4390.56 --> 4396.320000000001
but she's probably doing fine

4393.52 --> 4399.320000000001
i hope she is

4396.32 --> 4399.32
and

4400.4 --> 4406.48
let's see

4402.48 --> 4409.678999999999
yeah well my friend in niger

4406.48 --> 4413.199
is technically my ex-girlfriend

4409.679 --> 4417.12
we had really a short relationship

4413.199 --> 4420.32
but we yeah so i still talk with her

4417.12 --> 4423.679
still have contact with her as a as just

4420.32 --> 4423.679
a reliable friend

4424.32 --> 4430.159
any of my x's f ears on you do they

4427.199 --> 4431.919999999999
watch youtube no

4430.159 --> 4434.96
well my friend from nijmege is

4431.92 --> 4438.4800000000005
technically a flat earther like she she

4434.96 --> 4440.4800000000005
knows it but she look she has a kid

4438.48 --> 4442.4
she's single

4440.48 --> 4444.48
i think she is again

4442.4 --> 4446.96
and so she's like a single mother she

4444.48 --> 4449.44
doesn't have freaking time for youtube

4446.96 --> 4450.64
things unless she's like really studying

4449.44 --> 4452.32
something

4450.64 --> 4454.64
she doesn't have time for those types of

4452.32 --> 4457.12
distractions

4454.64 --> 4458.8
so no she doesn't watch youtube videos

4457.12 --> 4461.199
or my show

4458.8 --> 4466.360000000001
i don't know anybody personally that

4461.199 --> 4466.36
watches my show not a single person

4468.4 --> 4473.199
is amsterdam a nice city to live i don't

4470.56 --> 4474.56
know i've never lived there moonshadow

4473.199 --> 4477.04
i i don't

4474.56 --> 4479.84
i wouldn't want to live there i never

4477.04 --> 4481.76
liked the atmosphere the energy in the

4479.84 --> 4485.4800000000005
air there

4481.76 --> 4485.4800000000005
it's not good for me

4510.56 --> 4513.52
hey tony whitman

4518.4 --> 4523.28
yeah you're right stoney whitcomb yeah

4520.4 --> 4526.32
japan has definitely like purged the

4523.28 --> 4526.32
whole covet [ __ ]

4536.4 --> 4542.12
if you ever had a relationship with a

4538.239 --> 4542.12
single mother no

4566.96 --> 4570.4800000000005
dude

4567.76 --> 4572.2390000000005
i've been like completely

4570.48 --> 4575.12
solitary

4572.239 --> 4575.12
for eight years

4579.36 --> 4584.5599999999995
before that yeah plenty

4582.159 --> 4586.639999999999
plenty of things that i did and like

4584.56 --> 4589.6
flings and all that

4586.64 --> 4593.320000000001
i just i don't want to do it anymore

4589.6 --> 4593.320000000001
i'm done with that [ __ ]

4598.8 --> 4602.88
didn't want to change the subject well

4600.48 --> 4605.12
maybe i do maybe i don't really want to

4602.88 --> 4607.36
talk about my freaking love life in the

4605.12 --> 4610.96
past too much

4607.36 --> 4613.04
right i definitely don't want to like

4610.96 --> 4615.84
draw unwanted attention to those

4613.04 --> 4615.84
individuals

4618.56 --> 4622.8
right but

4619.84 --> 4625.84
if you want to know i have zero

4622.8 --> 4625.84
nasty x's

4625.92 --> 4631.04
like that have turned like into really

4627.92 --> 4634.56
nasty people zero

4631.04 --> 4638.56
oh maybe my ex i really don't hope it

4634.56 --> 4638.56
because that would probably destroy her

4639.199 --> 4644.0
but i've never been attracted to women

4642.239 --> 4645.28
that typically

4644.0 --> 4649.88
have that

4645.28 --> 4649.88
like i really don't like him

4679.199 --> 4682.4
what the [ __ ] larry

4690.88 --> 4695.84
i hope this doesn't sound weird what we

4693.12 --> 4695.84
care about you

4696.0 --> 4701.12
i know i know you're not asking to

4699.84 --> 4705.08
like

4701.12 --> 4705.08
screw with me or anything

4706.4 --> 4709.04
i know that

4709.84 --> 4714.96
a couple of your exes were pretty crazy

4711.679 --> 4717.84
yeah that just goes to show

4714.96 --> 4717.84
i don't like those

4718.8 --> 4725.28
and when i've like had flung flings with

4722.64 --> 4726.64
girls that then turned out to be kind of

4725.28 --> 4729.199
crazy

4726.64 --> 4732.4800000000005
i just like okay

4729.199 --> 4735.839999999999
well before you decide to start mentally

4732.48 --> 4738.08
parasiting and nagging me

4735.84 --> 4739.12
i'm going to out crazy you i'm going to

4738.08 --> 4742.48
show you

4739.12 --> 4746.4
and not like with physical violence ever

4742.48 --> 4749.36
ever not a single time my entire life

4746.4 --> 4751.92
not a single time ever

4749.36 --> 4753.599999999999
but i would just show them like

4751.92 --> 4757.36
you

4753.6 --> 4759.52
cannot [ __ ] with me

4757.36 --> 4761.12
i'll make it so strainful for you to

4759.52 --> 4762.96
even approach me

4761.12 --> 4765.5199999999995
when you're in that mood

4762.96 --> 4770.28
you'll just stop doing it and there's

4765.52 --> 4770.280000000001
nothing you can do to change that

4780.56 --> 4785.6
besides as soon as i kind of decide that

4783.28 --> 4786.32
i'm not going to share love

4785.6 --> 4789.1990000000005
from

4786.32 --> 4791.199
my heart actually with a girl

4789.199 --> 4794.0
everything changes

4791.199 --> 4795.759999999999
like everything changes and they usually

4794.0 --> 4797.92
just like

4795.76 --> 4798.8
they just snap out of it and just move

4797.92 --> 4802.4
away

4798.8 --> 4802.400000000001
try to find another boyfriend

4803.28 --> 4811.199
and do you have any arwinian units in

4807.28 --> 4811.199
pp paypal what

4813.28 --> 4816.28
did

4829.6 --> 4832.6
ah

4832.96 --> 4837.84
well i don't have any arwinian units in

4835.44 --> 4839.839999999999
paypal but i definitely got a donation

4837.84 --> 4843.08
from you in paypal thank you very much

4839.84 --> 4843.08
tony whitcomb

4851.76 --> 4855.1990000000005
so yeah

4853.28 --> 4861.08
you have been

4855.199 --> 4861.08
absorbed of being gay thank you

4865.36 --> 4869.799999999999
yeah i really appreciate it

4880.48 --> 4884.08
every woman has skeletons in their

4882.159 --> 4885.92
closet i disagree

4884.08 --> 4889.28
i think that's just the type of women

4885.92 --> 4892.0
that you find interesting and attractive

4889.28 --> 4892.0
from the grave

4896.239 --> 4902.718999999999
i mean i think every woman probably has

4898.96 --> 4904.32
bumped into weird situations

4902.719 --> 4906.32
but that doesn't mean like serious

4904.32 --> 4908.96
skeletons in their closet not every

4906.32 --> 4913.48
woman does that

4908.96 --> 4913.4800000000005
i actually like those that don't

4917.12 --> 4922.08
that's the code our winning units but

4919.76 --> 4924.08
our winning units are really like

4922.08 --> 4925.6
apparent distances

4924.08 --> 4928.84
right

4925.6 --> 4931.92
our winning units are all about the

4928.84 --> 4934.719
celestials the apparent distance of the

4931.92 --> 4934.719
celestials

4935.84 --> 4939.719
what's that steamy traveler

4966.639 --> 4971.08
what

4968.08 --> 4971.08
what

4982.8 --> 4988.320000000001
why did you bring that up steamy

4984.639 --> 4988.32
traveler like

4993.36 --> 4997.199
yeah one au is the apparent distance of

4995.92 --> 5000.0
a rainbow

4997.199 --> 5003.12
two a u is the apparent distance to the

5000.0 --> 5004.56
moon 3au is the apparent distance to the

5003.12 --> 5006.32
sun

5004.56 --> 5010.2390000000005
you understand

5006.32 --> 5010.239
that's how the irwinian units work

5011.44 --> 5017.12
are we needing units money no i don't

5013.44 --> 5017.12
have my own currency thanks

5020.32 --> 5024.5599999999995
what's my oh my god come on

5025.52 --> 5031.84
kind of a question is that

5029.44 --> 5031.839999999999
really

5035.04 --> 5039.56
i mean like are you 12.

5052.96 --> 5057.76
that's so you don't have to say here's

5054.96 --> 5059.84
money for you

5057.76 --> 5062.400000000001
okay well fine if you want to call it

5059.84 --> 5064.159000000001
our winning units that's fine as long as

5062.4 --> 5065.199
i actually get it

5064.159 --> 5067.199
right

5065.199 --> 5070.599999999999
you could call them unicorn farts for

5067.199 --> 5070.599999999999
all i care

5072.719 --> 5076.32
our winning units is fine

5076.48 --> 5080.599999999999
but it is technically incorrect

5112.48 --> 5118.32
you know it's incorrect yeah

5115.199 --> 5121.04
are one are we enforced no no no that's

5118.32 --> 5121.04
not it no

5122.32 --> 5127.239
no i'm not associating with forces

5124.239 --> 5127.239
thanks

5127.28 --> 5131.44
see you know what happened last time

5129.12 --> 5133.28
when somebody did that right remember

5131.44 --> 5135.28
newton

5133.28 --> 5138.4
i'm not gonna

5135.28 --> 5142.4
make of a force no the apparent distance

5138.4 --> 5142.4
is that's just fine right

5142.56 --> 5147.120000000001
i like to have that associated

5145.12 --> 5148.0
i'm not gonna like

5147.12 --> 5149.36
name

5148.0 --> 5151.04
a force

5149.36 --> 5152.0
thanks

5151.04 --> 5155.4
that's

5152.0 --> 5155.4
very ill-advised

5158.08 --> 5163.6
why is the sun

5159.92 --> 5163.6
further away than the moon

5167.679 --> 5171.52
well it isn't actually farther away it

5170.48 --> 5175.678999999999
just

5171.52 --> 5175.679
appears to be farther away right

5176.8 --> 5180.719
but yeah

5177.92 --> 5183.1990000000005
if you focus on it differently in your

5180.719 --> 5185.679
mind then it can seem to be the same

5183.199 --> 5185.678999999999
distance

5187.6 --> 5192.96
there's no actual distance though it

5190.0 --> 5194.4
isn't actually further away

5192.96 --> 5197.679
than the moon

5194.4 --> 5200.4
it's just in the irwinian unit

5197.679 --> 5202.639
apparent distances

5200.4 --> 5205.759999999999
it is further away

5202.639 --> 5208.08
or it appears to be further away

5205.76 --> 5208.08
right

5209.12 --> 5213.599999999999
the amount of relative density this

5211.12 --> 5216.08
equilibrium no

5213.6 --> 5218.0
that's just density this equilibrium

5216.08 --> 5220.96
force

5218.0 --> 5223.6
i'm not why would you name it

5220.96 --> 5225.12
that would only conceal

5223.6 --> 5227.84
the true nature

5225.12 --> 5231.5199999999995
right i think that relative density this

5227.84 --> 5234.159000000001
equilibrium force should be called

5231.52 --> 5236.84
just that this equilibrium force density

5234.159 --> 5240.0
this equilibrium force because it's

5236.84 --> 5241.28
critical that it's actually emphasized

5240.0 --> 5243.76
in

5241.28 --> 5245.5199999999995
in what it is

5243.76 --> 5248.4800000000005
what it is about if you're going to call

5245.52 --> 5250.96
it orwinian force oh guess what people

5248.48 --> 5252.959999999999
are then have a giant

5250.96 --> 5256.08
giant foothold

5252.96 --> 5260.4800000000005
to misunderstand and misapply it thanks

5256.08 --> 5263.199
no that's what we should not do ever

5260.48 --> 5265.28
it's a really bad idea

5263.199 --> 5268.159
besides you think anybody out there is

5265.28 --> 5270.639
going to agree with me oh let's call it

5268.159 --> 5273.04
orwinian force now oh yeah

5270.639 --> 5276.76
oh they're gonna love that

5273.04 --> 5276.76
no no thanks

5289.679 --> 5293.679
is it common for dutch people to speak

5291.52 --> 5296.56
english as well as you do no

5293.679 --> 5296.56
no it isn't

5297.6 --> 5299.84
no

5306.719 --> 5314.0
hello sam sam love the show no thanks

5311.199 --> 5314.96
glad you enjoyed it are we in threes no

5314.0 --> 5320.52
it's

5314.96 --> 5320.52
dude it's not my world okay

5322.4 --> 5328.638999999999
i am not like trump i don't like to put

5325.36 --> 5328.639
my name on everything

5332.239 --> 5338.4
i like to be associated with smart

5334.96 --> 5340.56
things that are really unique

5338.4 --> 5342.719
but they're not like going to be common

5340.56 --> 5347.159000000001
tongue i don't want to be part of the

5342.719 --> 5347.159
common vernacular thanks

5358.96 --> 5362.96
all right well if you're going to go

5360.4 --> 5365.5199999999995
with arwenian three space

5362.96 --> 5367.52
then i guess you could

5365.52 --> 5370.159000000001
conceive

5367.52 --> 5372.8
the presuppositional based system of the

5370.159 --> 5375.12
rectangular looping realm

5372.8 --> 5378.719
perhaps to be armenian three space

5375.12 --> 5380.239
because it is assuming the option of a

5378.719 --> 5384.88
loop

5380.239 --> 5384.879999999999
but no it's just ill-advised

5385.12 --> 5390.84
it's much better to just find the right

5387.76 --> 5394.639
words that are descriptive of its

5390.84 --> 5397.4400000000005
function so that it can't be mistaken

5394.639 --> 5400.56
about what it is because that is a

5397.44 --> 5402.08
universal problem right now

5400.56 --> 5404.639
right

5402.08 --> 5406.8
universal

5404.639 --> 5408.159000000001
there's literally people working out

5406.8 --> 5411.400000000001
there

5408.159 --> 5413.199
actively probably even paid to so

5411.4 --> 5417.199
confusion

5413.199 --> 5420.638999999999
about what things are on purpose

5417.199 --> 5423.5199999999995
to literally brainwash people

5420.639 --> 5425.679
by throwing out blatant error and

5423.52 --> 5428.639
misunderstanding and then reinforcing

5425.679 --> 5432.08
those misunderstandings

5428.639 --> 5434.8
right to literally deprogram people with

5432.08 --> 5437.28
insaneness insanity

5434.8 --> 5440.639
do it on purpose

5437.28 --> 5443.04
they want people to lose cohesion

5440.639 --> 5444.719
so that they lose grip

5443.04 --> 5448.4
and then they're gonna look for somebody

5444.719 --> 5450.8
oh help i lost grip can you please

5448.4 --> 5453.5199999999995
tell me how it is

5450.8 --> 5453.52
mind control

5455.04 --> 5460.88
you are already one of the big

5458.08 --> 5460.88
really i am

5461.679 --> 5464.719
well

5462.4 --> 5464.719
why

5465.44 --> 5467.839999999999
well

5466.4 --> 5470.239
it's just that

5467.84 --> 5474.0
you wouldn't tell by just looking at the

5470.239 --> 5474.0
amount of subscribers i have

5474.8 --> 5480.8
but okay if you say so i'm a big in the

5478.56 --> 5482.080000000001
flat earth big name

5480.8 --> 5484.8
am i

5482.08 --> 5484.8
am i really

5487.28 --> 5491.679
i mean how many people really

5489.52 --> 5492.719
talk about me like nathan

5491.679 --> 5494.159
oakley

5492.719 --> 5496.4800000000005
does actually

5494.159 --> 5498.719
mention me quite regularly

5496.48 --> 5503.159
and i really appreciate that and i try

5498.719 --> 5503.159
to mention him as well

5509.92 --> 5514.96
but like how many how many people do you

5512.719 --> 5514.96
know

5515.36 --> 5520.48
even mention my name

5518.4 --> 5523.36
out there

5520.48 --> 5526.08
on their shows

5523.36 --> 5529.08
besides sean hawkins besides baller

5526.08 --> 5529.08
asses

5534.0 --> 5538.56
i guess yeah jim bob does actually

5536.48 --> 5539.759999999999
mention me but hey i do show up in his

5538.56 --> 5541.6
chat

5539.76 --> 5544.320000000001
that's awesome

5541.6 --> 5546.159000000001
and he does respect me and i'm very

5544.32 --> 5549.44
thankful for that that he's just willing

5546.159 --> 5553.719
to kind of like openly do that

5549.44 --> 5553.719
but that's kind of rare

5560.8 --> 5565.52
i i don't know maybe

5563.04 --> 5567.92
maybe i'm down playing myself

5565.52 --> 5570.320000000001
it's just i don't really know i don't

5567.92 --> 5573.04
really know what to do with that

5570.32 --> 5576.88
it's not like oh i've got fame well that

5573.04 --> 5579.28
means now i'm going to expand and like

5576.88 --> 5582.4800000000005
create an operation like

5579.28 --> 5585.199
the total amount of income that i even

5582.48 --> 5588.799999999999
get from this doesn't really show that

5585.199 --> 5591.599999999999
i'm like a big name like at all

5588.8 --> 5594.159000000001
i'm freaking poor

5591.6 --> 5596.08
actually poor

5594.159 --> 5598.0
by dutch standards

5596.08 --> 5600.639
i mean

5598.0 --> 5603.76
well isn't really poor not like

5600.639 --> 5605.52
really poor it's just low class

5603.76 --> 5608.2390000000005
that's it

5605.52 --> 5608.2390000000005
financially

5610.88 --> 5615.1990000000005
what

5612.08 --> 5618.639
nobody in flat earth or or the globe

5615.199 --> 5621.04
youtubers don't know who i am whoa

5618.639 --> 5624.8
really

5621.04 --> 5624.8
are you sure about that moon shadow

5625.84 --> 5630.4400000000005
start arwenian debates no

5631.92 --> 5637.12
now why would i do that i got the flat

5634.32 --> 5639.44
earth debates i got nathan oakley

5637.12 --> 5640.88
he's really good at that i like doing

5639.44 --> 5645.678999999999
this

5640.88 --> 5648.4800000000005
i like just me on the screen talking

5645.679 --> 5650.96
keep that way i can keep a focus much

5648.48 --> 5653.759999999999
easier i have the freedom that i need to

5650.96 --> 5659.4
sprout the ideas

5653.76 --> 5659.400000000001
to to dig up the unique gems right

5669.679 --> 5674.0
well some people won't come on nathan's

5671.76 --> 5674.0
show

5675.12 --> 5680.0
okay

5677.12 --> 5680.0
or does it matter

5680.96 --> 5687.36
i mean there's my chat

5683.28 --> 5690.32
that's just fine isn't it

5687.36 --> 5692.639
do i like a quantum eraser

5690.32 --> 5692.639
yeah

5694.56 --> 5700.92
i mean he can be a bit of a difficult

5696.719 --> 5700.92
person but he is great

5701.28 --> 5708.32
like the only real downside i feel about

5704.239 --> 5708.32
him is that he like overreacts a lot

5709.92 --> 5713.28
like a bit of foaming at the mouth

5711.52 --> 5716.159000000001
passion about things

5713.28 --> 5719.599999999999
but i think he's very smart and he

5716.159 --> 5723.839999999999
especially just has so much oversight

5719.6 --> 5723.84
and that's really valuable thing to have

5726.08 --> 5731.5199999999995
you could have fight oh my god no why

5729.6 --> 5734.159000000001
what's the purpose of that classical

5731.52 --> 5736.400000000001
homeopath why would i go up against the

5734.159 --> 5738.719
numpties why would i even do that

5736.4 --> 5740.4
anymore i mean i have done that a couple

5738.719 --> 5743.199
of times

5740.4 --> 5745.36
but do do i need to do that

5743.199 --> 5746.638999999999
am i gonna accomplish anything about

5745.36 --> 5748.4
that

5746.639 --> 5750.08
you know what's gonna happen right when

5748.4 --> 5752.0
i do that again

5750.08 --> 5754.96
it's just gonna be oh blah blah blah

5752.0 --> 5758.4
blah oh you're a fantasist

5754.96 --> 5760.0
stupid sound bites played over my

5758.4 --> 5761.5199999999995
responses

5760.0 --> 5764.48
and then it's gonna be

5761.52 --> 5767.6
oh yeah oh well don't you agree that

5764.48 --> 5770.879999999999
nathan oakley is so unreasonable in his

5767.6 --> 5773.04
inhumane and slander land

5770.88 --> 5776.2390000000005
like what's the purpose

5773.04 --> 5777.76
to even go there anymore like i am not

5776.239 --> 5780.159
like a

5777.76 --> 5781.92
hardcore technical debater like that

5780.159 --> 5784.799999999999
some people are really good at it they

5781.92 --> 5788.639
get super sharp and then they can

5784.8 --> 5790.88
interactively work against

5788.639 --> 5793.4400000000005
baller machination and mind control

5790.88 --> 5794.88
techniques that are fully automated

5793.44 --> 5795.839999999999
for them

5794.88 --> 5798.56
right

5795.84 --> 5801.1990000000005
i just don't have the patience i'm just

5798.56 --> 5801.1990000000005
going to be like

5801.76 --> 5805.76
can you please not do that

5803.92 --> 5807.92
it's so annoying

5805.76 --> 5809.119000000001
right that's going to be my response why

5807.92 --> 5811.76
would i

5809.119 --> 5814.239
i just want have i want to have actual

5811.76 --> 5816.96
civil conversation

5814.239 --> 5818.959999999999
and i'll even entertain

5816.96 --> 5820.8
globe cosmology

5818.96 --> 5822.159
for sci-fi

5820.8 --> 5826.0
purposes

5822.159 --> 5829.36
or for dual cosmogonical purposes

5826.0 --> 5831.04
that's it why would i even go onto those

5829.36 --> 5833.199
channels anymore

5831.04 --> 5834.48
when it's just the same [ __ ] over and

5833.199 --> 5838.5599999999995
over again

5834.48 --> 5840.4
they're not actually interested

5838.56 --> 5842.0
i don't want to talk

5840.4 --> 5845.5199999999995
with people

5842.0 --> 5848.719
that are not actually interested you see

5845.52 --> 5850.639
because i think it's a waste of time

5848.719 --> 5853.639
let them waste their own time and not

5850.639 --> 5853.639
mine

5857.6 --> 5859.84
uh

5861.199 --> 5864.4
i mean it can be hilarious to watch it

5863.52 --> 5869.2390000000005
back

5864.4 --> 5869.239
when somebody else goes up against him

5871.52 --> 5876.0
and if they want to do that if they want

5873.199 --> 5878.879999999999
to take that challenge yeah sure why not

5876.0 --> 5881.679
you'll learn something you know

5878.88 --> 5883.36
as for me no it's just

5881.679 --> 5886.2390000000005
why

5883.36 --> 5886.239
what's the purpose

5888.32 --> 5891.599999999999
that's not what i'm about

5890.4 --> 5894.159
i'm about

5891.6 --> 5896.400000000001
digging through things that nobody

5894.159 --> 5898.48
thinks about

5896.4 --> 5901.119
or that people have a lot of trouble

5898.48 --> 5903.199
finding cohesion within that's what i do

5901.119 --> 5906.48
i'm like

5903.199 --> 5906.48
i'm the frontier

5907.52 --> 5910.92
final frontier

5912.32 --> 5917.199
not not the final maybe this that's a

5914.88 --> 5920.159000000001
star trek reference but

5917.199 --> 5924.159
i'd like to do that

5920.159 --> 5925.759999999999
i like to walk on that edge of inside

5924.159 --> 5928.638999999999
while the bickering

5925.76 --> 5931.76
behind me just continues and continues

5928.639 --> 5933.679
right i'm exploring

5931.76 --> 5935.52
i'm exploring the spiritual and the

5933.679 --> 5936.84
mental realm

5935.52 --> 5939.280000000001
and the

5936.84 --> 5942.719
design that's what i like to do that's

5939.28 --> 5942.719
where my talents come in

5943.119 --> 5950.08
just being part of the bickering with

5945.92 --> 5954.2390000000005
people that just don't want to know

5950.08 --> 5954.239
is a waste of my time and talents

5959.04 --> 5963.6
my tune is okay yeah i agree stone

5961.28 --> 5965.5199999999995
monkey 3d

5963.6 --> 5966.88
he is still very much

5965.52 --> 5971.6
a cultist

5966.88 --> 5975.28
he is a cultist very much but he is

5971.6 --> 5976.0
kind of nice so i kind of see mctoon

5975.28 --> 5977.92
no

5976.0 --> 5981.76
it's all intended or anything but i kind

5977.92 --> 5984.719
of see him like what's it called again

5981.76 --> 5986.96
like a jehovah's witness type

5984.719 --> 5990.08
like they are very nice too but they're

5986.96 --> 5991.52
[ __ ] cultists you know they are

5990.08 --> 5993.92
nuts

5991.52 --> 5994.8
in their own way but they're always very

5993.92 --> 5997.679
nice

5994.8 --> 5999.52
and mactune is kind of like that too

5997.679 --> 6001.92
but that still doesn't really make me

5999.52 --> 6003.52
like him but i do appreciate he did send

6001.92 --> 6006.96
me a bible

6003.52 --> 6010.159000000001
i'm still i'm i will thank him for that

6006.96 --> 6012.4800000000005
even now even though it's been years ago

6010.159 --> 6014.4
so yeah he is kind of a nice guy but he

6012.48 --> 6017.5199999999995
is a freaking cultist he is a baller

6014.4 --> 6017.5199999999995
cultist absolutely

6017.84 --> 6025.04
megatoon tap dances for super chat

6020.84 --> 6025.04
what okay that is weird

6025.28 --> 6030.0
if he's good at it

6027.52 --> 6030.0
why not

6034.159 --> 6039.599999999999
right and by the way stone monkey 3d who

6036.96 --> 6041.6
what baller out there wouldn't wanna

6039.6 --> 6044.719
poke fun at nathan oakley in the flat

6041.6 --> 6046.96
earth debates okay

6044.719 --> 6046.96
it's

6048.56 --> 6051.92
i mean

6049.6 --> 6054.96
it's like if you're going to be in that

6051.92 --> 6057.6
on that side of the debate

6054.96 --> 6059.92
you're almost like you can't not do it

6057.6 --> 6062.96
you're obligated the spirit just forces

6059.92 --> 6062.96
you to do that so

6063.52 --> 6067.52
it's an expression okay i didn't know

6065.36 --> 6067.5199999999995
that

6071.92 --> 6076.36
all right by the way i'll be back two

6073.36 --> 6076.36
minutes

6165.28 --> 6168.28
um

6177.199 --> 6183.759999999999
nathan he uses other people uh

6181.44 --> 6186.5599999999995
really

6183.76 --> 6188.8
that's a weird thing to say moonshadow

6186.56 --> 6191.4400000000005
i'm very sure that nathan

6188.8 --> 6194.88
actually knows a lot

6191.44 --> 6196.719
and can do it all by himself

6194.88 --> 6199.04
right but yeah

6196.719 --> 6201.36
nathan and me are really not that all

6199.04 --> 6202.84
that different when it comes to

6201.36 --> 6204.719
flat earth

6202.84 --> 6207.4400000000005
lore and

6204.719 --> 6207.44
psychology

6207.6 --> 6212.639
like nathan pays very close attention to

6210.239 --> 6215.919999999999
my analysis especially when it concerns

6212.639 --> 6217.76
psychology and i can see it because he

6215.92 --> 6221.28
is reflecting

6217.76 --> 6223.84
my lore a lot and he's integrating it

6221.28 --> 6226.0
like he's really getting a grip right so

6223.84 --> 6227.84
but yeah i too

6226.0 --> 6229.679
look do you think that i've ever would

6227.84 --> 6232.08
have ever really

6229.679 --> 6233.6
gotten to know as much about for example

6232.08 --> 6235.76
the sexton

6233.6 --> 6237.92
if it wasn't for the flat earth debates

6235.76 --> 6240.4800000000005
and 10th man no

6237.92 --> 6242.4800000000005
would have ever figured out academics

6240.48 --> 6244.48
and the scientific method

6242.48 --> 6247.759999999999
as much as i have if it wasn't for

6244.48 --> 6250.718999999999
quantum eraser no

6247.76 --> 6252.159000000001
right so we're all learning from each

6250.719 --> 6255.119
other

6252.159 --> 6257.679
nathan doesn't use other people he

6255.119 --> 6260.5599999999995
learns from other people

6257.679 --> 6261.92
and he provides a platform for people to

6260.56 --> 6264.320000000001
share their

6261.92 --> 6266.159
knowledge when it concerns flat earth

6264.32 --> 6267.759999999999
lore a lot

6266.159 --> 6269.92
so i kind of disagree with that

6267.76 --> 6273.2390000000005
statement

6269.92 --> 6273.2390000000005
moon shadow

6278.0 --> 6283.28
besides me who is the smartest most

6280.08 --> 6283.28
knowledgeable member of it

6283.44 --> 6287.599999999999
it's difficult steamy traveler like

6286.159 --> 6290.32
they're all

6287.6 --> 6290.320000000001
pretty smart

6290.96 --> 6296.159
but they have each person has their own

6293.76 --> 6298.159000000001
typical issues

6296.159 --> 6300.48
it's like they're all pretty unique

6298.159 --> 6301.5199999999995
individuals

6300.48 --> 6304.718999999999
but

6301.52 --> 6306.88
in my opinion i think that

6304.719 --> 6309.199
like brian is

6306.88 --> 6312.719
really freaking smart

6309.199 --> 6316.0
but he has the typical issues also that

6312.719 --> 6318.4800000000005
come with being really freaking smart

6316.0 --> 6321.199
right but he is

6318.48 --> 6321.199
very bright

6323.6 --> 6328.4800000000005
but in a certain way

6326.08 --> 6330.4
he's like

6328.48 --> 6335.599999999999
all about the mechanical

6330.4 --> 6335.599999999999
details and being very fluent in that

6336.48 --> 6340.638999999999
like

6338.08 --> 6345.84
i don't know if he is but

6340.639 --> 6345.84
like he would have been a great engineer

6349.199 --> 6354.719
he's just good i think he is very smart

6352.56 --> 6358.0
is he the smartest

6354.719 --> 6360.88
i don't know

6358.0 --> 6361.679
and i think qe is also very smart but

6360.88 --> 6364.719
again

6361.679 --> 6367.92
typical issues that come with that

6364.719 --> 6370.4800000000005
and gets very loud right so with qe it's

6367.92 --> 6373.28
all about how do you get him quiet

6370.48 --> 6376.08
enough to really share

6373.28 --> 6376.08
his brilliance

6378.88 --> 6381.679
right also

6382.4 --> 6386.199
who else is on there

6386.4 --> 6389.5199999999995
see yeah i had a meekan

6388.08 --> 6392.0
yeah i almost forgot about it i think

6389.52 --> 6395.84
that adam meekin

6392.0 --> 6395.84
is actually smarter than i am

6397.6 --> 6402.56
but

6398.56 --> 6404.4800000000005
maybe not smarter but he is wiser

6402.56 --> 6407.84
very experienced

6404.48 --> 6409.599999999999
with like he has high wisdom

6407.84 --> 6413.1990000000005
very high wisdom

6409.6 --> 6415.6
and i like really really respect him and

6413.199 --> 6419.119
that's difficult to achieve

6415.6 --> 6421.360000000001
because i i trust adam with like really

6419.119 --> 6425.44
personal emotions and that's like kind

6421.36 --> 6425.44
of he's like the only one really

6427.6 --> 6432.56
i mean sometimes i tr and trust

6430.639 --> 6435.04
people that i don't know all that well

6432.56 --> 6437.679
with kind of emotional things

6435.04 --> 6440.639
but that's more like a stranger effect

6437.679 --> 6444.2390000000005
adam i really know that he gets me

6440.639 --> 6444.2390000000005
and that's not an easy thing

6445.76 --> 6450.320000000001
do you think neil is

6448.8 --> 6451.4400000000005
well sorry

6450.32 --> 6453.679
neil

6451.44 --> 6453.678999999999
no

6454.96 --> 6457.84
no

6458.4 --> 6464.08
but he does have a strong spirit and a

6462.239 --> 6467.119
lot of passion

6464.08 --> 6469.119
smart no

6467.119 --> 6470.88
but he's a good guy

6469.119 --> 6472.88
and he and he does

6470.88 --> 6475.6
have loyalty but he also has anger

6472.88 --> 6478.2390000000005
issues etc etc it's

6475.6 --> 6478.2390000000005
moody guy

6479.36 --> 6483.799999999999
but no i don't think he's smart

6484.0 --> 6488.56
but that doesn't mean i automatically

6485.84 --> 6488.56
don't like him

6493.6 --> 6497.119000000001
he never seems to have an original

6495.28 --> 6498.48
thought well you'd have to dig a little

6497.119 --> 6500.719
deeper

6498.48 --> 6503.36
he does

6500.719 --> 6504.56
i mean he's not completely ass backwards

6503.36 --> 6506.5599999999995
or anything

6504.56 --> 6508.719
but when he gets riled up and he has

6506.56 --> 6510.88
that a lot yeah then he does become

6508.719 --> 6512.719
dumber

6510.88 --> 6514.56
but when he's actually really calm

6512.719 --> 6517.6
you'll be surprised

6514.56 --> 6519.04
he's actually quite

6517.6 --> 6521.6
insightful

6519.04 --> 6521.6
at times

6522.56 --> 6526.719
but when he gets rowdy yeah then he just

6524.8 --> 6527.4400000000005
becomes kind of like a bull

6526.719 --> 6530.44
just

6527.44 --> 6530.44
rare

6544.4 --> 6550.5599999999995
what are you talking about hungry lion

6547.44 --> 6553.28
dubey did a video about nukes three

6550.56 --> 6555.599
other flat oh really what

6553.28 --> 6558.88
do you actually watch any other videos

6555.599 --> 6560.4800000000005
besides eric debase hungry lion

6558.88 --> 6563.92
cause

6560.48 --> 6563.919999999999
that's complete hogwash

6566.8 --> 6570.96
i've talked about it

6568.56 --> 6574.0
i don't think i've ever done like a a

6570.96 --> 6576.0
title episode about it or anything

6574.0 --> 6577.199
but yeah i've addressed it for a long

6576.0 --> 6579.36
time

6577.199 --> 6581.28
nathan has addressed it for a long time

6579.36 --> 6583.119
flatters debates has addressed it

6581.28 --> 6586.159
officially

6583.119 --> 6586.159
quite a few times

6590.639 --> 6595.4400000000005
and like even geronism and glowbusters

6593.36 --> 6599.119
have addressed it quite a few times so

6595.44 --> 6599.119
what are you talking about hungry lion

6605.28 --> 6609.36
there are no videos are there yeah there

6607.52 --> 6611.92
are

6609.36 --> 6616.639
it's probably just not in the title oh

6611.92 --> 6619.4400000000005
oh by the way owen benjamin hello

6616.639 --> 6620.56
he's he's done like entire shows about

6619.44 --> 6623.44
it

6620.56 --> 6625.52
so i have i don't know

6623.44 --> 6629.199
what you are talking about

6625.52 --> 6629.1990000000005
explicit video oh you mean

6629.84 --> 6636.0
like textbook themed shows

6633.599 --> 6638.88
where he reads out things that he's

6636.0 --> 6640.96
pre-read he's literally narrating

6638.88 --> 6642.88
his explanation that thing yeah that's

6640.96 --> 6644.32
what eric debay does he does it quite

6642.88 --> 6645.92
good

6644.32 --> 6648.08
it's not perfect

6645.92 --> 6649.36
he's he has a lot of

6648.08 --> 6651.92
mistakes

6649.36 --> 6653.92
throughout his entire works it's very

6651.92 --> 6655.599
persistent level

6653.92 --> 6657.92
almost makes me think he's kind of a

6655.599 --> 6660.0
secret gatekeeper

6657.92 --> 6662.719
it's very difficult

6660.0 --> 6664.719
but it's [ __ ]

6662.719 --> 6668.159
you benjamin isn't on youtube what are

6664.719 --> 6671.28
you so what

6668.159 --> 6671.28
he's still out there

6672.239 --> 6677.239
he's on

6673.679 --> 6677.2390000000005
bitchute now

6682.159 --> 6685.679
so yeah you're just wrong

6687.119 --> 6692.48
there was many videos before the purge

6689.599 --> 6696.719
no there is still there's still plenty

6692.48 --> 6700.0
of videos about it nukes aren't real

6696.719 --> 6703.04
it's impossible big bombs oh yeah

6700.0 --> 6703.04
nukes no

6706.32 --> 6709.84
not the way they say they are

6709.92 --> 6714.8
that science fiction

6711.92 --> 6717.52
doesn't actually happen

6714.8 --> 6720.639
every time something got nuked it's

6717.52 --> 6723.1990000000005
actually fire bombed

6720.639 --> 6726.1990000000005
there's no radio activity

6723.199 --> 6726.199
none

6742.8 --> 6747.04
what about fission

6744.4 --> 6747.92
nuke reactors working on different

6747.04 --> 6751.04
prince

6747.92 --> 6753.28
it's just heating

6751.04 --> 6755.44
it's just heat

6753.28 --> 6758.159
you go you got a clump of radioactive

6755.44 --> 6759.598999999999
material it it generates heat it heats

6758.159 --> 6762.08
water

6759.599 --> 6764.0
put it in water it creates steam it's a

6762.08 --> 6766.96
steam turbine that's what nuclear

6764.0 --> 6770.28
reactors are they're steam turbines

6766.96 --> 6770.28
that's it

6794.239 --> 6797.239
um

6812.719 --> 6816.4
what went wrong at your wheel

6816.719 --> 6818.96
uh

6819.52 --> 6824.56
i don't know exactly

6822.0 --> 6827.76
i do know like a meltdown

6824.56 --> 6827.76
is probably real

6828.0 --> 6832.88
something about like because it can heat

6830.639 --> 6835.04
up and then yeah it can melt it they

6832.88 --> 6838.96
probably have a problem

6835.04 --> 6840.8
am i pro nuclear energy production

6838.96 --> 6843.199
well

6840.8 --> 6844.4800000000005
yeah

6843.199 --> 6845.28
yeah i am

6844.48 --> 6847.119
but

6845.28 --> 6850.4
conditionally

6847.119 --> 6854.0
because we can't just keep using these

6850.4 --> 6855.759999999999
super super old outdated shitty nuclear

6854.0 --> 6858.719
power plants from

6855.76 --> 6861.04
highly corrupted companies

6858.719 --> 6865.76
that are like blatantly

6861.04 --> 6869.119
evil and corrupt and anti-human right

6865.76 --> 6869.119000000001
it's got to be modernized

6869.44 --> 6873.36
safety

6871.119 --> 6876.5599999999995
should be highest priority no more

6873.36 --> 6878.799999999999
[ __ ] no more scurrying around

6876.56 --> 6882.400000000001
from a bunch of globalist [ __ ]

6878.8 --> 6887.1990000000005
secret surface pieces of [ __ ]

6882.4 --> 6887.199
just super safe nuclear energy

6893.199 --> 6896.598999999999
it's easy

6913.199 --> 6916.199
do

6923.28 --> 6928.639
yeah tony whit well it's difficult

6926.159 --> 6931.28
to even say how what that is because

6928.639 --> 6932.88
they did kind of like

6931.28 --> 6936.719
buried

6932.88 --> 6936.719
the power plant under concrete

6938.32 --> 6942.88
officially

6940.08 --> 6945.28
but yeah it seems just fine

6942.88 --> 6948.599
life is actually thriving

6945.28 --> 6948.599
around chernobyl

6960.719 --> 6965.92
yeah well from the grave it's not

6963.119 --> 6967.119
like nuclear bombs literally do not

6965.92 --> 6969.36
exist

6967.119 --> 6972.48
like at all

6969.36 --> 6975.598999999999
like that's a complete fake out

6972.48 --> 6978.08
it's it's not it doesn't exist it's not

6975.599 --> 6982.88
different from what they say it just

6978.08 --> 6985.679
literally does not exist at all

6982.88 --> 6990.08
it does not exist nuclear bombs are

6985.679 --> 6990.08
complete 100 fiction

6992.48 --> 6996.5599999999995
and at the time they were pure

6994.639 --> 7000.4800000000005
terrifying and that's what it was meant

6996.56 --> 7000.4800000000005
for to scare everybody into

7000.56 --> 7007.280000000001
like

7002.88 --> 7008.8
stop engaging with war activities

7007.28 --> 7010.48
that's what it was meant for but

7008.8 --> 7013.84
unfortunately

7010.48 --> 7016.48
military industry has definitely kept up

7013.84 --> 7019.1990000000005
simpson has developed since then and so

7016.48 --> 7020.5599999999995
there are just really [ __ ] up big

7019.199 --> 7022.48
bombs

7020.56 --> 7024.080000000001
and other technologies we don't even

7022.48 --> 7028.5599999999995
know about probably

7024.08 --> 7029.679
so yeah nukes are pure mind control

7028.56 --> 7032.4800000000005
but

7029.679 --> 7035.719
military industry has probably caught up

7032.48 --> 7035.718999999999
to it

7054.719 --> 7059.84
yeah nukes are not real that's right

7056.56 --> 7059.84
they're pure science fiction

7068.639 --> 7075.28
all explosion videos are fake oh yeah

7073.119 --> 7076.32
you should know that

7075.28 --> 7078.0
right

7076.32 --> 7079.759999999999
buildings and all that are not gonna

7078.0 --> 7082.8
blow up

7079.76 --> 7086.0
get ripped away while the camera stays

7082.8 --> 7087.04
perfectly still without even a vibration

7086.0 --> 7089.28
yeah

7087.04 --> 7092.159
that's like the first hint like this is

7089.28 --> 7094.719
absolutely fake

7092.159 --> 7097.119
but yeah if you're in the thrill you

7094.719 --> 7099.76
might not pick up on that you'll be

7097.119 --> 7101.839999999999
suspended in your disbelief

7099.76 --> 7104.159000000001
like watching a movie right when you

7101.84 --> 7106.2390000000005
watch a movie like oh my god a nuclear

7104.159 --> 7107.759999999999
bomb yeah it's like oh

7106.239 --> 7110.5599999999995
you're not going to pay attention you're

7107.76 --> 7114.679
just the thrill right

7110.56 --> 7114.679
that's that's what it is

7129.36 --> 7134.32
and quite literally thank god it's fake

7132.56 --> 7135.92
thank god

7134.32 --> 7138.799999999999
right

7135.92 --> 7141.04
god doesn't allow things

7138.8 --> 7143.360000000001
that allows people

7141.04 --> 7147.92
in corruption stages

7143.36 --> 7151.36
to be able to destroy all things god

7147.92 --> 7151.36
doesn't allow that

7152.0 --> 7158.0
he doesn't allow his creation

7155.679 --> 7160.2390000000005
to completely self-destruct

7158.0 --> 7163.28
you can only self-destruct yourself you

7160.239 --> 7165.04
can't just destroy you can't destroy

7163.28 --> 7166.5599999999995
everything

7165.04 --> 7168.96
you know on a whim

7166.56 --> 7173.8
that's physic it doesn't allow that he

7168.96 --> 7173.8
doesn't allow things to come to that

7193.04 --> 7196.56
did i say that hungry line

7197.52 --> 7202.8
look nuclear fission is a description

7201.28 --> 7204.48
is a

7202.8 --> 7207.4400000000005
atomic

7204.48 --> 7209.678999999999
theory based description

7207.44 --> 7212.719
of what the radioactive material

7209.679 --> 7215.36
supposedly does in reality

7212.719 --> 7217.84
whether that model is true or not is

7215.36 --> 7219.679
completely irrelevant what is relevant

7217.84 --> 7222.56
is what practically happens it's

7219.679 --> 7224.32
material it heats

7222.56 --> 7226.96
things

7224.32 --> 7229.44
they use it to heat water

7226.96 --> 7231.199
then the steam creates pressure

7229.44 --> 7234.08
it's a steam turbine

7231.199 --> 7238.199
that's what nuclear reactors do

7234.08 --> 7238.199
that's really all that's relevant

7260.88 --> 7265.04
it makes a difference from perspective

7262.56 --> 7267.52
for costing up

7265.04 --> 7271.239
so what

7267.52 --> 7271.2390000000005
is that my problem

7284.88 --> 7287.92
all right the only thing that's really

7286.56 --> 7289.280000000001
relevant

7287.92 --> 7292.4800000000005
is that

7289.28 --> 7294.8
a setup for a nuclear reactor must be

7292.48 --> 7297.839999999999
and they already exist i've seen design

7294.8 --> 7297.84
blueprints for this

7298.48 --> 7302.08
right it must

7300.56 --> 7305.04
prevent

7302.08 --> 7307.5199999999995
hydrogen gas formation

7305.04 --> 7311.679
which could lead to the infamous

7307.52 --> 7314.2390000000005
explosions because that's dangerous

7311.679 --> 7314.2390000000005
that's it

7315.679 --> 7319.92
what causes the electromagnetic pulse

7322.159 --> 7325.5599999999995
i don't know

7346.639 --> 7350.96
so what generates are you serious

7351.599 --> 7356.8
what generates the stream

7353.92 --> 7360.159
the heat the heat that comes off the i

7356.8 --> 7361.599
think it's uranium mostly

7360.159 --> 7364.159
the heat

7361.599 --> 7366.4800000000005
heat comes off it it it keeps coming off

7364.159 --> 7369.28
it there's no end to that

7366.48 --> 7371.919999999999
no foreseeable end

7369.28 --> 7374.4
it heats the water the water evaporates

7371.92 --> 7379.4800000000005
it creates steam pressure turbines are

7374.4 --> 7379.48
driven by the steam pressure that's it

7402.96 --> 7406.84
made by dude

7413.04 --> 7415.92
what

7413.92 --> 7418.4800000000005
are you talking like that

7415.92 --> 7420.4
made by uranium

7418.48 --> 7423.839999999999
like could you please keep it a little

7420.4 --> 7423.839999999999
coherent with the english

7435.119 --> 7439.4
no there is no radiation don't you

7438.079 --> 7444.159
understand

7439.4 --> 7446.879999999999
radioactivity like that doesn't exist

7444.159 --> 7449.679
it doesn't do anything

7446.88 --> 7452.8
it's like porcelain

7449.679 --> 7454.639
yeah you read it it doesn't do

7452.8 --> 7457.76
anything

7454.639 --> 7457.76
it's a myth

7458.239 --> 7462.839999999999
it's like a myth of a poisonous gas that

7461.92 --> 7466.88
isn't

7462.84 --> 7466.88
poisonous don't you understand

7472.159 --> 7478.119
yeah no [ __ ] chernobyl was fake what do

7474.96 --> 7478.119
you think

7478.96 --> 7481.679
the hell man

7491.76 --> 7497.84
everything concerning nukes

7495.119 --> 7500.719
and power plant blow-ups even the

7497.84 --> 7502.88
[ __ ] safety [ __ ] protocols it's

7500.719 --> 7504.079
all fake 100

7502.88 --> 7507.84
fake

7504.079 --> 7508.88
yeah falling down nuclear physicist

7507.84 --> 7511.119000000001
fake

7508.88 --> 7512.639
fake work

7511.119 --> 7513.759999999999
it's all fake

7512.639 --> 7517.04
everything

7513.76 --> 7517.04
it's all fake

7517.92 --> 7525.36
it's just steam turbines that's it

7522.239 --> 7529.839999999999
no radioactivity dangerous at all

7525.36 --> 7532.639
at all literally none zero

7529.84 --> 7535.92
the entire world could be doused in

7532.639 --> 7538.0
radioactivity it wouldn't matter the

7535.92 --> 7540.8
slightest

7538.0 --> 7540.8
don't do it

7540.88 --> 7545.119
right there's other consequences that i

7543.199 --> 7547.04
personally

7545.119 --> 7549.839999999999
am suspicious of

7547.04 --> 7549.84
that they might exist

7550.48 --> 7553.759999999999
right i think radioactivity could

7552.32 --> 7556.079
potentially

7553.76 --> 7560.84
contribute to damage

7556.079 --> 7560.84
under very specific conditions

7563.52 --> 7569.360000000001
interestingly enough moral conditions

7567.119 --> 7571.28
but that's my suspicion

7569.36 --> 7575.4
i have no proof whatsoever it is

7571.28 --> 7575.4
damaging at all

7600.239 --> 7605.839999999999
x-ray machinist yeah but x-ray machine

7602.96 --> 7605.84
is different

7607.52 --> 7614.56
yeah exposure to that is harmful it's

7610.48 --> 7614.5599999999995
different that's not the same

7617.599 --> 7624.159000000001
right just like extreme heavy radar

7621.679 --> 7626.4
signal constantly going through you at

7624.159 --> 7628.96
short range is extremely damaging and

7626.4 --> 7632.079
that's provable that's like

7628.96 --> 7634.32
instant proof

7632.079 --> 7634.32
right

7635.44 --> 7639.48
it's like direct results

7646.719 --> 7652.96
also there is the poison factor like the

7649.52 --> 7654.56
material like uranium is literally

7652.96 --> 7657.599
poisonous

7654.56 --> 7657.599
it's not healthy

7659.28 --> 7662.8
neutrinos i don't know

7664.159 --> 7669.199
i'm not a nuclear physicist

7666.4 --> 7672.759999999999
i'm not like

7669.199 --> 7672.759999999999
all about that

7682.32 --> 7688.719
like really when it goes to

7685.28 --> 7691.599
when atomic things go beyond

7688.719 --> 7693.04
protons neutrons electrons

7691.599 --> 7695.4400000000005
i kind of like

7693.04 --> 7697.44
i'm like whatever man

7695.44 --> 7700.5599999999995
like i don't

7697.44 --> 7700.5599999999995
i don't believe that

7700.96 --> 7707.84
is all that micros this micro that to me

7703.76 --> 7709.76
that's literally horse pocky to me

7707.84 --> 7712.32
it's like divining

7709.76 --> 7717.320000000001
squiggly lines

7712.32 --> 7717.32
it's total horseshit to me

7763.199 --> 7765.5199999999995
man

7765.84 --> 7771.159000000001
joe been going over two hours sheesh

7772.079 --> 7774.5599999999995
is flown

7775.199 --> 7781.44
can't see atoms with a microscope either

7778.719 --> 7783.199
well you can with an electron microscope

7781.44 --> 7784.5599999999995
although you can't literally see it you

7783.199 --> 7785.44
can

7784.56 --> 7787.280000000001
see

7785.44 --> 7789.839999999999
a model

7787.28 --> 7791.679
in which atoms do

7789.84 --> 7793.1990000000005
seem to be present

7791.679 --> 7797.56
it's complicated

7793.199 --> 7797.5599999999995
i've seen through an electron microscope

7801.599 --> 7807.119000000001
but what you basically get to see is a

7803.44 --> 7809.678999999999
rendering of this space

7807.119 --> 7813.119
the maneuvering room space of the

7809.679 --> 7814.8
electrons past the atom that's really

7813.119 --> 7816.239
what you get to see with an electron

7814.8 --> 7818.159000000001
microscope

7816.239 --> 7822.32
so it just shows you

7818.159 --> 7822.32
where the electrons could not reach

7823.36 --> 7829.32
and yeah they do seem like

7826.0 --> 7829.32
little balls

7830.96 --> 7834.719
and that is presumed to be atoms

7835.44 --> 7839.48
and i can go with that

7869.84 --> 7874.719
right so anything else otherwise i'm

7871.599 --> 7874.719
gonna run out the show

7882.8 --> 7885.84
what's that

7896.96 --> 7900.4800000000005
hmm

7898.48 --> 7903.04
that's an electron microscope readout

7900.48 --> 7903.04
interesting

7907.84 --> 7911.32
what the hell

7916.56 --> 7918.88
what

7925.84 --> 7929.8
okay that's kind of creepy

7941.36 --> 7944.36
huh

7960.159 --> 7965.5599999999995
interesting steamy traveler creepy but

7962.56 --> 7965.56
interesting

7968.639 --> 7973.28
atomic structure is like a little solar

7971.04 --> 7976.28
system oh they love to think that don't

7973.28 --> 7976.28
they

7983.28 --> 7988.159
now now clearly that's only if you

7985.52 --> 7988.159000000001
presume

7988.48 --> 7992.959999999999
that the separated elements assume to be

7991.92 --> 7994.56
there

7992.96 --> 7997.199
positive

7994.56 --> 8000.320000000001
electrons neutrons

7997.199 --> 8002.48
protons are actually little balls on

8000.32 --> 8005.04
themselves there is no evidence for that

8002.48 --> 8007.919999999999
at all there is no evidence that

8005.04 --> 8010.96
separately they are like little balls as

8007.92 --> 8013.28
presumed to be a solar system

8010.96 --> 8017.04
that's just atomism

8013.28 --> 8019.84
that's literally atomistic philosophy

8017.04 --> 8021.199
the fractal idea that everything is

8019.84 --> 8023.76
little balls

8021.199 --> 8028.638999999999
that's where that idea comes from

8023.76 --> 8031.52
there's no evidence for that whatsoever

8028.639 --> 8033.28
there's no proof an electron

8031.52 --> 8037.1990000000005
a neutron

8033.28 --> 8040.96
or a proton is a little bow at all

8037.199 --> 8042.48
at all it's no evidence for that

8040.96 --> 8044.639
can't see it

8042.48 --> 8047.598999999999
you can model it you're going to

8044.639 --> 8051.599
calculate it but you can't actually have

8047.599 --> 8054.639
empirical confirmation of it other than

8051.599 --> 8054.639
calculus based

8054.88 --> 8059.36
right so yeah very elaborate show today

8057.119 --> 8062.5599999999995
lots of different subjects

8059.36 --> 8062.5599999999995
lots of different subjects

8064.48 --> 8070.5599999999995
right so thanks everyone for coming for

8067.92 --> 8071.4400000000005
this extra long saturday show unusually

8070.56 --> 8073.599
long

8071.44 --> 8076.159
i do feel so much stronger now i think

8073.599 --> 8078.84
that i might actually be through

8076.159 --> 8081.28
that damn valley of

8078.84 --> 8084.639
mine because i

8081.28 --> 8086.96
did not have like a single

8084.639 --> 8088.079
disruptive feeling or anything

8086.96 --> 8090.2390000000005
today

8088.079 --> 8092.239
i hope that keeps up

8090.239 --> 8094.32
because i was literally getting sick of

8092.239 --> 8097.36
that [ __ ]

8094.32 --> 8099.28
right so if you like this show

8097.36 --> 8101.36

8107.679 --> 8112.639
weekdays and 2 pm amsterdam time in the

8109.679 --> 8114.639
weekend and please also do support me

8112.639 --> 8116.56
through the paypal patreon crypto wallet

8114.639 --> 8118.96
super chat and a membership system join

8116.56 --> 8120.96
button that will be much appreciated and

8118.96 --> 8122.719
needed and thank you

8120.96 --> 8123.92
tony whitcomb earlier for the paypal

8122.719 --> 8126.159
donation

8123.92 --> 8127.84
really appreciate that

really appreciate it

8127.84 --> 8131.4400000000005
and you are

8129.28 --> 8134.079
absolved of being gay

8131.44 --> 8137.199
now if only the rest of my chat would

8134.079 --> 8140.239
follow a suit

8137.199 --> 8142.239
we can all have a bright future

8140.239 --> 8144.28
right so i will be back tomorrow with

8142.239 --> 8147.36
flat earth early bird number

8144.28 --> 8149.44
1057 on the sunday edition

8147.36 --> 8151.36
hope to see you all there i don't think

8149.44 --> 8154.159
there's going to be ball busters this

8151.36 --> 8157.199
saturday since there was one last week

8154.159 --> 8159.679
but who knows maybe there will be

8157.199 --> 8161.04
i tend to get it wrong

8159.679 --> 8162.719
but we'll see

8161.04 --> 8164.96
right

8162.719 --> 8168.19
until the next video

8164.96 --> 8199.469
keep it flat

8168.19 --> 8199.469
[Music]

8222.8 --> 8224.88
you
