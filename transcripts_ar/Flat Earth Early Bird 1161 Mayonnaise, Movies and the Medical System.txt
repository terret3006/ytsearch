123.659 --> 129.72
gray soup up there big clouds

127.259 --> 132.25900000000001
a bit of rain here and there but not

129.72 --> 132.259
constantly

135.66 --> 138.2

155.16 --> 158.16
2022.

158.4 --> 161.239
ah

162.66 --> 166.76
hello Kevlar good to see you

174.0 --> 178.019
went to bed a bit late again

176.58 --> 181.81900000000002
but

178.019 --> 181.81900000000002
yeah I still slept okay

184.08 --> 188.81900000000002
ah this is me and my bad habits of just

186.72 --> 190.92
clicking on a movie and then like oh now

188.819 --> 191.7
I want to watch it yeah you shouldn't do

190.92 --> 193.73899999999998
that

191.7 --> 196.61999999999998
if you want to explore for movies you

193.739 --> 197.94
got to do it earlier our win I keep

196.62 --> 200.09900000000002
doing it

197.94 --> 201.42
and anyway I broke the movie off and

200.099 --> 204.2
just

201.42 --> 204.2
went to bed

207.48 --> 210.01899999999998
right

211.7 --> 219.72
yeah yesterday the storm was quite

215.819 --> 221.7
quite intense and yeah on my way to the

219.72 --> 223.739
grocery store today

221.7 --> 226.92
there was literally

223.739 --> 229.68
just branches everywhere on the road

226.92 --> 232.79899999999998
or at least like on the uh the

229.68 --> 235.019
bicyclists part of the road

232.799 --> 237.06
I think most of the actual Road had been

235.019 --> 239.34
cleared because that yeah could be a

237.06 --> 242.58
hazard because there was a pretty big

239.34 --> 243.9
branches Here There and also got to the

242.58 --> 247.37900000000002
point apparently

243.9 --> 250.08
not even roof tiles

247.379 --> 252.72
have been blown off roofs and shattered

250.08 --> 254.64000000000001
all over the place so yeah a couple of

252.72 --> 257.579
those

254.64 --> 261.71999999999997
like at least in three different spots

257.579 --> 263.88
where I where I went by

261.72 --> 266.84000000000003
so it's been a pretty

263.88 --> 266.84
heavy storm

267.419 --> 272.15999999999997
and yeah yesterday even during the Flat

269.699 --> 274.979
Earth debates

272.16 --> 278.1
I was mostly active in chat not so much

274.979 --> 280.86
really on the panel but still sometimes

278.1 --> 282.96000000000004
here and there but like

280.86 --> 285.84000000000003
because the wind at that point was so

282.96 --> 289.13899999999995
heavy that the the chair that I have or

285.84 --> 292.56
the white chair it there was

289.139 --> 294.479
chair pinball going on on my balcony

292.56 --> 296.36
it was literally just ding ding ding

294.479 --> 299.78
ding ding ding ding

296.36 --> 302.36
almost blew over the rail

299.78 --> 306.979
went up

302.36 --> 306.97900000000004
just it was really heavy wind

307.979 --> 313.5
was bunny hopping falling branches well

310.38 --> 315.3
I didn't go out like during that heavy

313.5 --> 317.22
storm because it was it was a little

315.3 --> 319.46000000000004
crazy and besides I didn't really need

317.22 --> 319.46000000000004
to

319.62 --> 324.36
but it's kind of funny to see like how

322.38 --> 326.21999999999997
the birds were dealing with it

324.36 --> 328.02000000000004
because there were birds were still

326.22 --> 330.96000000000004
flying around and they were like using

328.02 --> 333.06
the wind almost like a roller coaster

330.96 --> 334.68
like they weren't just like oh I really

333.06 --> 337.34
need to get there no they were just like

334.68 --> 337.34000000000003
oh I'm going

340.08 --> 345.96
but they were having fun at it

343.199 --> 349.1
was It was kind of yeah it was

345.96 --> 349.09999999999997
interesting to see that

349.979 --> 356.9
ah hey gear shifter you were outside

353.94 --> 356.9
during the storm

361.08 --> 366.24
yeah it was pretty heavy

364.259 --> 368.58000000000004
usually these kinds of storms don't

366.24 --> 370.979
really happen in February they tend to

368.58 --> 374.96
happen during April

370.979 --> 374.96
so I wonder if this is some

377.58 --> 380.59999999999997
new pattern

383.639 --> 388.259
like now I'm extra curious what's the

386.039 --> 391.09999999999997
weather going to be like during April is

388.259 --> 391.1
it gonna be different

391.38 --> 396.6
because usually when the weather is like

394.199 --> 400.56
really out of place for a prolonged

396.6 --> 404.16
period in ways it tends to reflect

400.56 --> 406.199
on the rest of the sea it's like

404.16 --> 409.74
it's like a sound

406.199 --> 413.28000000000003
wave with ups and downs effect if there

409.74 --> 416.94
is one twist to it somewhere then

413.28 --> 419.099
usually it influences everything else

416.94 --> 421.8
that's kind of like how I

419.099 --> 423.419
reason that out so I'm just very curious

421.8 --> 425.96000000000004
as to how the weather is going to be the

423.419 --> 425.96
rest of the year

426.599 --> 432.259
anyway hey Nathan Oakley

428.819 --> 432.259
good to see you Adam Price

439.319 --> 444.08000000000004
it's going to be rainy in April all

441.96 --> 444.08
right

446.58 --> 449.539
to repair

454.5 --> 458.52
well there's certainly going to be some

455.94 --> 462.599
people that are going to need to replace

458.52 --> 465.24
their roof tiles after a storm like that

462.599 --> 467.099
but I don't know if if this was like the

465.24 --> 471.599
only Peak or that it's really gonna pick

467.099 --> 474.199
up and storm at it again I don't know

471.599 --> 474.199
so

498.12 --> 501.68
anyway how are you guys doing

502.919 --> 506.65999999999997
it's a good show yesterday Nathan

512.099 --> 517.82
it went on pretty yeah a decent amount

515.459 --> 517.8199999999999
of time

518.399 --> 525.56
that was nice and we had a there was a

521.519 --> 525.5600000000001
very long after after show

531.959 --> 534.959
is

536.76 --> 539.42
right

539.94 --> 542.6
anyway

543.12 --> 548.399
man I had to run out of all of our food

546.6 --> 550.2
items yesterday

548.399 --> 552.899
like

550.2 --> 557.1
I ran out of my mayonnaise that's weird

552.899 --> 560.82
because usually I don't forget that

557.1 --> 565.62
so like yeah french fries no mayonnaise

560.82 --> 570.1800000000001
hmm a hamburger without mayonnaise hmm

565.62 --> 572.399
baked eggs without mayonnaise hmm so

570.18 --> 574.019
like every meal I had actually didn't

572.399 --> 575.82
have the mayonnaise that I'm used to

574.019 --> 577.14
because I eat a lot of that I love that

575.82 --> 581.0
stuff

577.14 --> 581.0
but yeah I'm stocked up on that again

582.66 --> 586.8199999999999
it should be good to go for the next

584.519 --> 586.82
week

590.779 --> 596.8389999999999
hollandaise what

593.459 --> 596.8389999999999
no it's mayonnaise

599.16 --> 604.519
such like my yeah they do I do

605.76 --> 609.779
especially like french fries yeah you

608.399 --> 612.06
can't have french fries with them

609.779 --> 614.04
without mayonnaise

612.06 --> 616.26
right and the only reason I've ever

614.04 --> 617.6999999999999
heard other Dutch people like avoid

616.26 --> 619.56
mayonnaise

617.7 --> 621.5400000000001
usually not because they don't like it

619.56 --> 623.5189999999999
but because they're afraid of the fat

621.54 --> 626.2199999999999
nothing or something which is kind of

623.519 --> 629.64
ridiculous considering as to well what

626.22 --> 633.5600000000001
is in french fries themselves but

629.64 --> 633.56
that's how I noticed it

635.94 --> 641.4590000000001
and there's also like

637.98 --> 643.74
uh vegan mayonnaise and all that

641.459 --> 648.0189999999999
why would you want to do that well I

643.74 --> 648.019
don't know but there is that it exists

648.839 --> 654.2
mayonnaise is made with nasty oils uh

651.66 --> 657.0
that all depends on

654.2 --> 660.36
what type of mayonnaise you're gonna get

657.0 --> 663.56
George Sanford my mayonnaise is great

660.36 --> 663.5600000000001
it's all organic

663.72 --> 669.9200000000001
it's a very basic recipe basic is always

667.62 --> 669.92
better

672.839 --> 678.36
like the least processing that the

676.26 --> 680.959
product goes through

678.36 --> 680.9590000000001
the better

683.64 --> 686.12
anyway

686.76 --> 692.22
ah hold on to people like fruit sauce

689.76 --> 694.64
yeah that but that is kind of mayonnaise

692.22 --> 694.64
though

696.899 --> 703.94
it's just I think just there's some

699.899 --> 703.94
other herbs in it whatever

705.06 --> 712.0189999999999
but yeah pure oil yeah there is it's

708.06 --> 714.5999999999999
that's part of what it is oil but I am

712.019 --> 717.54
absolutely fine with oil you just gotta

714.6 --> 720.4200000000001
have a good quality oil

717.54 --> 722.579
yeah canola soy oil Yak yeah that's

720.42 --> 725.4799999999999
disgusting George Sanford I'd never buy

722.579 --> 725.4799999999999
anything with that

726.6 --> 731.76
I think that this is just all of

729.72 --> 733.139
oil-based which it should be that's what

731.76 --> 735.0
the original red that's where the

733.139 --> 738.6800000000001
original recipe is from

735.0 --> 738.68
the olive oil and

741.42 --> 746.8389999999999
once again

742.88 --> 746.8389999999999
mustard Maybe

746.94 --> 754.6800000000001
maybe some egg egg yolk or something

750.959 --> 756.5999999999999
I don't remember exactly what it is but

754.68 --> 757.67
yeah there's oil in there I have no

756.6 --> 760.76
problem with it

757.67 --> 760.76
[Music]

780.06 --> 783.0189999999999
mm-hmm

785.339 --> 791.6
if you read olive oil uh no George

789.06 --> 791.5999999999999
Sanford

792.36 --> 797.399
I don't know how your industry deals

794.7 --> 800.6600000000001
with that but no

797.399 --> 800.66
it's not in there

814.139 --> 817.6800000000001
honey mustard

819.0 --> 823.76
anyway

820.92 --> 823.76
foreign

841.86 --> 847.82
yeah there's wasps during like hot

844.68 --> 847.8199999999999
summers and all that

848.16 --> 851.06
it is true

851.1 --> 855.66
although it's usually like in my

852.959 --> 857.88
experience going to Spain during the

855.66 --> 860.16
summer it's much worse there

857.88 --> 862.5
like when there's wasps there's wasps

860.16 --> 864.74
and they get really freaking aggressive

862.5 --> 864.74
there

874.74 --> 877.279
anyway

889.74 --> 895.32
right yeah I'm open to talk about pretty

892.32 --> 897.0
much anything you guys like

895.32 --> 898.32
although I don't want to spend the

897.0 --> 900.92
entire show just talking about

898.32 --> 900.9200000000001
mayonnaise

900.959 --> 905.3389999999999
even though I'd like mayonnaise it's not

903.3 --> 907.88
really like my favorite subject to keep

905.339 --> 907.8800000000001
talking about

911.1 --> 916.339
although yeah I have a in the past I

914.399 --> 919.62
think that

916.339 --> 921.6600000000001
my mother did make like her own

919.62 --> 923.4590000000001
mayonnaise a couple of times

921.66 --> 926.54
was it my dad I don't remember and it

923.459 --> 926.54
was it was okay

930.72 --> 936.48
but yeah I usually do like store

934.199 --> 938.16
mayonnaise a little bit more so I

936.48 --> 941.22
thought that like that self-made

938.16 --> 943.079
mayonnaise is like almost too intense

941.22 --> 944.94
although yeah you gotta just learn how

943.079 --> 946.9799999999999
to perfectly balance it out and if you

944.94 --> 948.6
just do it one or two times then you'd

946.98 --> 951.019
never really get to that perfected

948.6 --> 951.019
balance

951.42 --> 956.579
uh

953.699 --> 959.7199999999999
no we can't talk about tartar sauce

956.579 --> 959.7199999999999
steamy Traveler

970.079 --> 974.3599999999999
about pendulum with a spring

974.639 --> 982.519
I said gravity is really tough to what

979.019 --> 982.519
okay at least G

984.839 --> 989.639
movie recommendations

987.959 --> 993.3
well

989.639 --> 996.899
I was kind of watching an old movie

993.3 --> 999.3
an old movie about old times

996.899 --> 1001.519
it was kind of interesting so far I've

999.3 --> 1004.4799999999999
seen like the first hour and it was

1001.519 --> 1004.48
interesting because

1004.579 --> 1008.2399999999999
I don't know

1005.899 --> 1009.56
because it really felt like that old

1008.24 --> 1011.48
time in a way

1009.56 --> 1013.459
uh

1011.48 --> 1017.74
called the natural it's about baseball

1013.459 --> 1017.7399999999999
in like the 20s or something

1019.82 --> 1024.319
so that's that's the movie that I got

1022.519 --> 1028.179
called watching last night but I got

1024.319 --> 1028.1789999999999
only halfway it's like a two hour movie

1031.52 --> 1036.559
and I I kind of liked it you know why

1034.88 --> 1040.5790000000002
because

1036.559 --> 1044.0
the ways that was that the actors were

1040.579 --> 1046.6399999999999
acting was really of that time and to

1044.0 --> 1048.679
see that and then put it right next to

1046.64 --> 1050.0
where how things happen in the world

1048.679 --> 1053.539
right now

1050.0 --> 1056.179
it's like wow oh they're doing it so

1053.539 --> 1058.16
natural like all of that is so natural

1056.179 --> 1060.8200000000002
so old-fashioned

1058.16 --> 1060.8200000000002
like

1061.16 --> 1064.8400000000001
I thought it was really beautiful

1065.12 --> 1069.559
it was like a relief to see women

1067.22 --> 1072.44
actually act like women

1069.559 --> 1074.84
and men act like men

1072.44 --> 1077.96
and everybody like correcting each other

1074.84 --> 1080.059
like to be better and it's just I love

1077.96 --> 1083.2
that I love

1080.059 --> 1083.2
how it used to be

1083.78 --> 1087.62
and I thought that in this movie it was

1085.94 --> 1090.38
just really

1087.62 --> 1092.86
focused on that right it wasn't just

1090.38 --> 1096.2
like liberals trying to

1092.86 --> 1100.039
Barrel their way through or like overly

1096.2 --> 1102.44
glorify feminism or nothing like that or

1100.039 --> 1105.86
maybe in the second half I hope not

1102.44 --> 1107.6000000000001
but it wasn't about that it was just

1105.86 --> 1109.34
about how things were and how the

1107.6 --> 1111.26
culture was and I really really

1109.34 --> 1113.86
appreciated it

1111.26 --> 1113.86
so

1134.0 --> 1141.16
that's Robert Radford is that the actor

1136.46 --> 1141.16
in there I'm really bad at actor names

1150.2 --> 1152.38
foreign

1152.72 --> 1155.559
oh damn

1158.96 --> 1161.6200000000001
what

1170.52 --> 1174.94
[Applause]

1171.82 --> 1174.9399999999998
[Music]

1176.179 --> 1180.94
the right 1984 movie

1189.919 --> 1197.5
huh the guy apparently died even before

1194.179 --> 1197.5
change of the century

1211.1 --> 1213.6999999999998
hmm

1214.34 --> 1217.34
right

1222.98 --> 1228.6200000000001
those days probably won't come back

1225.08 --> 1232.84
cultry well

1228.62 --> 1232.84
the Kevlar they might

1233.419 --> 1238.5200000000002
right you gotta realize that that in

1236.0 --> 1241.22
itself is also a response

1238.52 --> 1243.679
to how things were going so the thing is

1241.22 --> 1246.919
about nature is that if you give it the

1243.679 --> 1248.1200000000001
room it will come back

1246.919 --> 1251.9
right

1248.12 --> 1255.799
nature will just reclaim

1251.9 --> 1257.419
like the plants reclaim but also the the

1255.799 --> 1260.299
natural mind

1257.419 --> 1262.76
if it's given the rule right otherwise

1260.299 --> 1264.559
yeah it's if you constantly gonna nag

1262.76 --> 1266.72
with it and don't give it the room then

1264.559 --> 1268.34
it's not gonna recover

1266.72 --> 1269.84
right

1268.34 --> 1272.84
but if you give it the room it does

1269.84 --> 1276.32
recover so if

1272.84 --> 1278.72
the world situation is somehow resolved

1276.32 --> 1281.6789999999999
which is like really

1278.72 --> 1281.679
a tough one

1284.299 --> 1290.4189999999999
then maybe people will actually just

1287.9 --> 1292.94
return to normal

1290.419 --> 1294.7990000000002
to a level right there will but there

1292.94 --> 1297.0800000000002
will probably always be crazies that are

1294.799 --> 1300.2
just stuck in that because

1297.08 --> 1304.1
that's what they want they want to be

1300.2 --> 1306.0800000000002
crazy they use it as an escapism

1304.1 --> 1306.98
because they don't want to deal with

1306.08 --> 1308.24
something

1306.98 --> 1310.88
right

1308.24 --> 1313.1
and and crazies have always been like

1310.88 --> 1315.2
that and have been around

1313.1 --> 1317.4189999999999
things that they hid in the shadows

1315.2 --> 1319.64
where they should be

1317.419 --> 1321.76
to deal with their own problems on their

1319.64 --> 1321.76
own

1325.4 --> 1331.24
right and then everybody else just gets

1327.98 --> 1331.24
the room but now this system

1331.28 --> 1337.52
reversed world beast system is

1334.76 --> 1339.5
constantly driving people insane and

1337.52 --> 1341.6589999999999
then highlighting them

1339.5 --> 1344.84
setting them as an example for everybody

1341.659 --> 1347.0800000000002
else to go insane that is the main

1344.84 --> 1347.08
problem

1350.539 --> 1353.08
right

1357.02 --> 1362.6
and in a sense I think that that is new

1359.48 --> 1365.1200000000001
I don't think that like government has

1362.6 --> 1367.6999999999998
ever been this openly insane

1365.12 --> 1370.4189999999999
like the the system is pretty damn

1367.7 --> 1370.419
insane

1372.14 --> 1376.76
because most of the time government

1374.539 --> 1379.64
manipulations and all that is always

1376.76 --> 1382.36
kind of they kind of keep it on the

1379.64 --> 1382.3600000000001
under the shadow

1383.0 --> 1386.659
they don't really want people to notice

1384.86 --> 1390.1399999999999
but now that it's just everything is

1386.659 --> 1393.679
just open Madness everywhere and that's

1390.14 --> 1395.659
kind of new oh although maybe one could

1393.679 --> 1397.94
consider it happened a few times before

1395.659 --> 1401.7800000000002
in history

1397.94 --> 1404.44
maybe like during the Caligula age

1401.78 --> 1408.2
during the

1404.44 --> 1411.26
reprie French Revolution

1408.2 --> 1412.82
enduring it so there might have been a

1411.26 --> 1415.34
couple of periods where things really

1412.82 --> 1418.1
were that insane but they always yeah

1415.34 --> 1420.5
end bloody

1418.1 --> 1423.9399999999998
right and yeah personally I think that

1420.5 --> 1423.94
that's what's going to happen

1424.76 --> 1428.84
because yeah the open insanity and the

1427.34 --> 1430.4599999999998
people that have been stuck up on it

1428.84 --> 1432.74
they don't know how to get out and they

1430.46 --> 1435.08
insist they insist that they're

1432.74 --> 1437.419
exterminated

1435.08 --> 1439.279
it's almost like they it's their Revenge

1437.419 --> 1442.039
to take people

1439.279 --> 1445.22
into madness with them

1442.039 --> 1449.62
which is like pretty damn devil

1445.22 --> 1449.6200000000001
worshiping witchcraft level insanity

1458.179 --> 1464.299
yeah it's very specifically tied into

1461.6 --> 1467.74
the devil it's like a devil's effect the

1464.299 --> 1467.74
devil Satan

1473.48 --> 1477.58
right so they insist that they are

1477.799 --> 1483.799
removed

1479.799 --> 1487.279
but they're making it so tough that they

1483.799 --> 1490.52
want to they want to show

1487.279 --> 1493.76
in a way Humanity that

1490.52 --> 1495.5
you can't stay civil they want to prove

1493.76 --> 1497.6
to us that we are

1495.5 --> 1502.059
animals

1497.6 --> 1502.059
because they show no other way

1503.179 --> 1508.8400000000001
all right anyway it's all pure

1504.62 --> 1508.84
destruction how they manage us

1510.679 --> 1515.3600000000001
and yeah I've lost my patience for that

1512.96 --> 1517.659
a long time ago and that's why I have

1515.36 --> 1517.6589999999999
certain

1517.82 --> 1521.2
types of mottos

1523.88 --> 1528.919
and why I

1526.1 --> 1531.8799999999999
lay down certain

1528.919 --> 1531.88
advices

1533.9 --> 1539.3600000000001
that people usually don't choose to go

1536.72 --> 1542.38
because I have lost my patience for all

1539.36 --> 1542.3799999999999
this a long time ago

1542.42 --> 1544.96
[Music]

1542.96 --> 1544.96
um

1546.26 --> 1548.44
anyway

1548.6 --> 1552.86
humans were tougher back then

1551.48 --> 1555.799
uh

1552.86 --> 1560.6589999999999
well hold on there Kevlar

1555.799 --> 1564.3799999999999
it no I don't think they were tougher

1560.659 --> 1568.159
they were just more cohesive

1564.38 --> 1570.6200000000001
they had more energy stability to fall

1568.159 --> 1574.0390000000002
back on they had more like

1570.62 --> 1578.1789999999999
somebody is like super hurt by terrible

1574.039 --> 1579.32
news everybody will respect that

1578.179 --> 1582.0800000000002
right

1579.32 --> 1584.96
and some that really care will step

1582.08 --> 1586.82
forward and immediately be nice but

1584.96 --> 1591.14
everybody will respect respectful

1586.82 --> 1592.82
remember that this movie shows how that

1591.14 --> 1594.5
Spirit worked back then it's the

1592.82 --> 1597.8799999999999
cohesion it's

1594.5 --> 1601.7
the Beast system the the

1597.88 --> 1605.179
autopilot connection wasn't tainted

1601.7 --> 1607.64
there was only one way the natural way

1605.179 --> 1610.659
to act and everybody was just doing that

1607.64 --> 1614.0
they didn't they didn't have any

1610.659 --> 1616.8200000000002
Communists that are constantly trying to

1614.0 --> 1619.22
unravel that and take that away that

1616.82 --> 1621.26
that spiritual cohesion and replace it

1619.22 --> 1623.72
with their [ __ ] woke

1621.26 --> 1627.52
mind

1623.72 --> 1627.52
which is exactly the opposite

1629.24 --> 1633.32
so I don't think humans were even

1630.98 --> 1638.179
tougher back then they just

1633.32 --> 1640.52
had more backing from each other

1638.179 --> 1642.6200000000001
because things work natural and

1640.52 --> 1644.779
everybody relied on that they could rely

1642.62 --> 1648.08
on that if they were like really shocked

1644.779 --> 1650.419
or hurt or even physically wounded they

1648.08 --> 1652.9399999999998
would still be able to gather the morale

1650.419 --> 1656.2990000000002
through others and through just having

1652.94 --> 1658.94
the peace they needed in the moment to

1656.299 --> 1661.22
recover really well

1658.94 --> 1663.5
compared to now where you're just

1661.22 --> 1665.8990000000001
constantly surrounded by psychological

1663.5 --> 1670.0
attacks

1665.899 --> 1670.0
I think that that is the main difference

1674.299 --> 1682.34
right and even in the movie in the movie

1678.5 --> 1683.899
there is like a propagandist there

1682.34 --> 1685.82
that's like

1683.899 --> 1687.7399999999998
supposed yeah there's like somebody

1685.82 --> 1690.08
hired to

1687.74 --> 1693.32
like give a speech or something and like

1690.08 --> 1695.779
encourage everybody to stop losing in

1693.32 --> 1698.36
that game it's like a psychologist but

1695.779 --> 1701.179
he's a propagandist he's like literally

1698.36 --> 1703.4599999999998
a little man and all that it's

1701.179 --> 1706.52
it was quite astounding

1703.46 --> 1709.3600000000001
really to see that with my eyes and my

1706.52 --> 1709.36
mind that I have today

1718.34 --> 1723.1999999999998
so yeah

1720.26 --> 1726.559
but everybody knew that everybody was

1723.2 --> 1729.02
annoyed with it back then too

1726.559 --> 1730.52
it was just the psychological warfare

1729.02 --> 1732.799
was just kind of

1730.52 --> 1735.679
being test dripped here and there

1732.799 --> 1738.44
carefully because there was cohesion

1735.679 --> 1739.88
with the people they just knew like this

1738.44 --> 1742.299
is kind of [ __ ] they're trying to

1739.88 --> 1742.2990000000002
trick us

1743.48 --> 1750.38
now it's you're surrounded with that so

1746.419 --> 1751.5800000000002
people take it as a second nature

1750.38 --> 1755.5390000000002
it's

1751.58 --> 1756.799
they don't have enough room and peace of

1755.539 --> 1761.62
mind

1756.799 --> 1761.62
to even notice the difference anymore

1772.94 --> 1777.799
or much tougher physically well but

1775.82 --> 1780.02
because they had the physical they had

1777.799 --> 1783.26
this social backing they had the moral

1780.02 --> 1784.52
spiritual backing to actually be like

1783.26 --> 1786.98
that

1784.52 --> 1787.94
they had the room to be natural and to

1786.98 --> 1789.919
be tough

1787.94 --> 1791.059
and people would love them for being

1789.919 --> 1794.0590000000002
tough

1791.059 --> 1796.399
and competition would mostly be

1794.059 --> 1799.1589999999999
honorable like if somebody had an ego

1796.399 --> 1801.1399999999999
like hey but I'm tough they would mostly

1799.159 --> 1802.88
be honorable

1801.14 --> 1806.659
right there weren't like really

1802.88 --> 1809.779
disgusting Gammas everywhere

1806.659 --> 1812.2990000000002
they're like really backstabbingly

1809.779 --> 1814.1
sabotaging you at every corner

1812.299 --> 1816.799
I mean there was some there but

1814.1 --> 1819.3799999999999
everybody would then kind of take care

1816.799 --> 1822.46
of that over time and eventually isolate

1819.38 --> 1822.46
them and kick them out

1830.53 --> 1835.34
[Music]

1832.399 --> 1838.34
if you were born in 1905 would you have

1835.34 --> 1841.9599999999998
become a communist no

1838.34 --> 1841.9599999999998
dude absolutely not

1847.7 --> 1850.0
no

1857.0 --> 1860.6
no I would have become exactly what I am

1859.64 --> 1863.96
now

1860.6 --> 1867.4399999999998
but much better and without all the

1863.96 --> 1867.44
scarring psychologically

1875.12 --> 1881.059
I would feel very at home in that time

1878.6 --> 1882.32
very at home because of the natural

1881.059 --> 1885.6789999999999
backing

1882.32 --> 1887.4189999999999
it's all it's all messed up this age is

1885.679 --> 1889.1000000000001
messed up it's not the way it's supposed

1887.419 --> 1893.3600000000001
to be

1889.1 --> 1896.36
with all my telepathic abilities

1893.36 --> 1898.2199999999998
I am figuring out it's not the way it's

1896.36 --> 1902.299
supposed to be they're supposed to be

1898.22 --> 1905.24
this network energy Network and it's all

1902.299 --> 1907.58
it's attacked it's being attacked

1905.24 --> 1910.419
it's not it doesn't work the way it's

1907.58 --> 1910.4189999999999
supposed to people

1911.0 --> 1914.62
have lost faculties

1917.899 --> 1923.32
I mean there's still some of it right

1920.48 --> 1923.32
but it's like

1925.159 --> 1929.5590000000002
yeah just some people get it

1930.14 --> 1934.159
and not nobody gets everything well back

1933.44 --> 1936.6200000000001
then

1934.159 --> 1940.48
some people got everything

1936.62 --> 1940.4799999999998
and most people got enough

1940.94 --> 1944.0800000000002
right that's the difference

1951.2 --> 1953.6200000000001
God

1987.26 --> 1989.919
all right

1996.23 --> 1999.299
[Music]

2001.24 --> 2003.419
foreign

2006.7 --> 2013.299
anyway so yeah that's a recommendation

2010.96 --> 2015.58
the movie

2013.299 --> 2019.019
did I link to the

2015.58 --> 2019.019
yeah IMDb

2019.779 --> 2025.48
it's really worth watching and we're

2022.179 --> 2028.0800000000002
worth watching with a very sharp and

2025.48 --> 2028.08
Calm Mind

2031.779 --> 2036.519
very interesting

2033.58 --> 2039.519
like it's another world like that movie

2036.519 --> 2041.94
is from 1984

2039.519 --> 2044.679
and it has like

2041.94 --> 2047.2
zero woke in it

2044.679 --> 2049.44
it's just

2047.2 --> 2052.599
it's it's the

2049.44 --> 2056.02
pre-woke form of

2052.599 --> 2056.98
like liberal mind but not even liberal

2056.02 --> 2059.2
it's

2056.98 --> 2062.2
it's

2059.2 --> 2065.5789999999997
it's good I really liked it and I'm

2062.2 --> 2065.5789999999997
definitely gonna finish watching it

2090.879 --> 2097.2999999999997
yeah okay Matthew Hall yeah it is crazy

2093.94 --> 2100.9
it's crazy enough that

2097.3 --> 2103.9
we should just not really listen anymore

2100.9 --> 2105.88
at all not even for a laugh

2103.9 --> 2110.32
that's my opinion I think that woke

2105.88 --> 2113.079
should we should literally give them

2110.32 --> 2116.02
like turn your back to them Amish

2113.079 --> 2118.96
treatment like literally don't look into

2116.02 --> 2120.7
it anymore don't listen to their great

2118.96 --> 2124.119
you already know it's not gonna make any

2120.7 --> 2127.7799999999997
sense don't let it even slip into your

2124.119 --> 2129.76
conscious because of some humor you

2127.78 --> 2134.1400000000003
might extract from just literally turn

2129.76 --> 2137.88
your back to it like this doesn't exist

2134.14 --> 2137.8799999999997
it doesn't exist anymore

2138.76 --> 2144.4
that's that's what I that's my attitude

2141.94 --> 2146.38
against work it it just doesn't exist

2144.4 --> 2149.619
anymore as soon as I see something about

2146.38 --> 2152.859
that I immediately turn my back

2149.619 --> 2155.579
I I just don't want to recognize it

2152.859 --> 2155.5789999999997
exists anymore

2155.68 --> 2161.5
it's not even funny to me I just I just

2159.52 --> 2164.099
want it go gone

2161.5 --> 2164.099
get out

2168.04 --> 2171.04
foreign

2173.8 --> 2180.3590000000004
when you are away from your computer and

2176.74 --> 2180.359
Flat Earth what do you like to do

2184.599 --> 2187.5
uh

2190.9 --> 2198.9
I don't know I've been behind my

2193.9 --> 2198.9
computer most of my life to be honest

2201.64 --> 2209.2599999999998
and that started really young

2205.18 --> 2211.72
I learned about computers before I kind

2209.26 --> 2214.42
of learned to socialize with people

2211.72 --> 2216.9399999999996
outside of my family so

2214.42 --> 2219.46
yeah

2216.94 --> 2221.32
but there's plenty of activities that

2219.46 --> 2226.2
don't involve computers that I have

2221.32 --> 2226.2000000000003
liked but that's usually just occasional

2227.56 --> 2232.0789999999997
right I've done plenty of other things

2255.7 --> 2261.2799999999997
wow science works in mysterious ways

2258.04 --> 2264.0
that's none of those movies appeal to me

2261.28 --> 2264.0
whatsoever

2268.48 --> 2275.88
okay Gizmo dude I'm just using the

2271.48 --> 2275.88
standard brand from Eco Plaza

2276.82 --> 2281.94
it's not a special brand it's their

2279.64 --> 2281.94
brand

2282.52 --> 2285.42
and it's great

2308.02 --> 2313.839
and if you're if you're looking for some

2310.54 --> 2316.54
staple manage just get a couple of

2313.839 --> 2318.7599999999998
different ones and try them out and just

2316.54 --> 2322.5
figure out like which one do I like the

2318.76 --> 2322.5
most I mean it's not like

2322.839 --> 2326.7
it's not super expensive or anything

2340.3 --> 2347.38
dude science works in mysterious ways

2343.06 --> 2350.7
like who cares it's a stupid movie it's

2347.38 --> 2350.7000000000003
some stupid horror

2350.92 --> 2358.839
slasher type [ __ ] oh oh I'm so happy

2355.359 --> 2362.2
it's not woke oh so it's only disastrous

2358.839 --> 2364.599
in one way it's just ariman it's not

2362.2 --> 2366.64
ariman and Lucifer okay

2364.599 --> 2369.1600000000003
okay

2366.64 --> 2372.5789999999997
no I don't care whether it's woke or not

2369.16 --> 2375.04
I don't care about those types of movies

2372.579 --> 2378.2200000000003
I mean the only way I care about it if

2375.04 --> 2380.68
it is if it's so bad that Felix is gonna

2378.22 --> 2383.02
make a review of it one day

2380.68 --> 2386.7599999999998
because that's the only way I care to

2383.02 --> 2386.7599999999998
know about any of that sort of thing

2393.4 --> 2396.359
that's fine

2403.66 --> 2408.8799999999997
who is my favorite letter scientist

2406.839 --> 2411.48
intellect that's

2408.88 --> 2411.48
what

2421.66 --> 2425.94
that's that's a weird question cycle

2425.98 --> 2434.22
I I might be yeah I might give you a

2429.22 --> 2434.22
very odd answer but yeah that will be me

2434.619 --> 2438.96
because I like my ideas the best

2440.079 --> 2447.04
and I actually have a whole range of

2443.02 --> 2450.16
ideas that could be tested in order to

2447.04 --> 2452.38
figure things out I don't actually do it

2450.16 --> 2455.5
and the theory is

2452.38 --> 2457.359
but yeah other than me

2455.5 --> 2459.52
okay

2457.359 --> 2461.44
this is a whole bunch of people out

2459.52 --> 2463.66
there and they have good sides and they

2461.44 --> 2466.78
have bad sides and

2463.66 --> 2468.8999999999996
and up moments and down moments I don't

2466.78 --> 2468.9
know

2471.4 --> 2477.88
it's just like somebody can be like in

2474.099 --> 2479.8
my favorite one moment and then a year

2477.88 --> 2484.26
later they're not

2479.8 --> 2484.26
so that's really you can't really tell

2488.74 --> 2493.18
but yeah I do appreciate the people that

2491.319 --> 2494.44
have hung around at the Flat Earth

2493.18 --> 2496.96
debates

2494.44 --> 2500.16
the guys over there I I really do

2496.96 --> 2500.16
appreciate all of them

2503.319 --> 2508.619
uh see you later James Mason good to see

2505.42 --> 2508.619
good to have you here in chat

2524.26 --> 2529.44
vinegar

2526.599 --> 2529.44
huh

2529.48 --> 2533.22
right it was with vinegar

2535.9 --> 2538.859
not just oil

2540.76 --> 2543.3590000000004
hmm

2550.3 --> 2553.079
interesting

2578.26 --> 2584.1600000000003
hello Emma Peel

2581.02 --> 2584.16
a [ __ ] gas head

2584.38 --> 2588.78
Fight The Mirage Earth hello also

2608.2 --> 2610.5
foreign

2630.46 --> 2639.64
danger of salmonella if using raw eggs

2634.079 --> 2642.2200000000003
no unless you're using really old or

2639.64 --> 2644.6189999999997
you old eggs

2642.22 --> 2647.22
or eggs from chickens that are kind of

2644.619 --> 2647.2200000000003
unhealthy

2663.88 --> 2668.7000000000003
yeah raw eggs are fine there's actually

2666.3 --> 2672.04
like this

2668.7 --> 2676.56
bodybuilding diet where people just chug

2672.04 --> 2676.56
raw eggs so yeah

2685.78 --> 2687.96
foreign

2705.78 --> 2711.42
kills things

2708.52 --> 2711.42
right

2713.2 --> 2719.0789999999997
well the thing

2715.06 --> 2721.66
about that with things like salmonella

2719.079 --> 2724.1800000000003
look the bacteria isn't even the problem

2721.66 --> 2727.1189999999997
it's what they excrete that is the

2724.18 --> 2729.3999999999996
problem that's why it's always like

2727.119 --> 2731.44
chicken meat or whatever you let it lay

2729.4 --> 2733.839
around too long

2731.44 --> 2735.579
the bacteria is not the issue it's what

2733.839 --> 2738.94
they excrete and if that builds up

2735.579 --> 2741.3390000000004
that's the thing that's poisonous so it

2738.94 --> 2743.8
had things like adding vinegar afterward

2741.339 --> 2746.38
doesn't help anything

2743.8 --> 2748.619
because it's not about the bacteria it's

2746.38 --> 2751.839
about the excretion and it won't

2748.619 --> 2754.5
neutralize the salmonella poison

2751.839 --> 2754.5
you see

2756.52 --> 2760.96
like

2757.8 --> 2763.98
bacteria don't really do anything

2760.96 --> 2763.98
they're not harmful

2772.079 --> 2776.5600000000004
is this an Fe show or a cooking show

2774.76 --> 2778.0600000000004
well it's less of a cooking show than

2776.56 --> 2781.06
qees

2778.06 --> 2783.099
if you know what I mean cycle

2781.06 --> 2785.7999999999997
where they literally talk with the

2783.099 --> 2789.3
entire group about food for a half hour

2785.8 --> 2789.3
non-stop standard

2797.52 --> 2802.06
no but mayonnaise was just brought up

2800.26 --> 2804.0400000000004
because for me it's a staple food and

2802.06 --> 2806.44
yesterday I didn't have any mayonnaise

2804.04 --> 2809.619
even though like every meal that I

2806.44 --> 2810.819
normally eat has mayonnaise so that was

2809.619 --> 2812.619
weird

2810.819 --> 2815.16
that's why it became a subject

2812.619 --> 2815.1600000000003
apparently

2819.64 --> 2824.339
do I believe in exosome theory

2825.28 --> 2830.7400000000002
believe well that's kind of pointless to

2828.4 --> 2833.14
say but yeah

2830.74 --> 2835.56
I think that that model is much more

2833.14 --> 2835.56
viable

2836.4 --> 2841.54
exosomes

2838.3 --> 2843.1800000000003
terrain Theory but most of the time I

2841.54 --> 2846.22
just

2843.18 --> 2847.96
completely bypass it by taking an angle

2846.22 --> 2851.5789999999997
of approach through German new medicine

2847.96 --> 2851.579
and Rudolph Steiner's Legacy

2851.68 --> 2858.96
and realize that even disease in itself

2854.92 --> 2858.96
isn't a direct result

2859.059 --> 2862.559
of like an infection

2863.38 --> 2868.0
that the infection

2865.3 --> 2869.92
is kind of a misnomed

2868.0 --> 2872.02
effect

2869.92 --> 2874.839
it's like a moment of weakness that's

2872.02 --> 2877.2599999999998
when certainly that's that stuff starts

2874.839 --> 2877.2599999999998
happening

2877.72 --> 2882.9399999999996
right that's when something happens

2880.9 --> 2885.099
but it's not because you got infected

2882.94 --> 2887.68
it's actually because you got a

2885.099 --> 2888.76
momentary weakness in a certain way and

2887.68 --> 2890.7999999999997
that's where German new medicine

2888.76 --> 2893.079
basically lays out how that kind of

2890.8 --> 2897.1600000000003
works

2893.079 --> 2899.26
in refined detail basically showing you

2897.16 --> 2902.74
a map of like okay

2899.26 --> 2905.079
what and where in the body

2902.74 --> 2907.2999999999997
and that will give you very strong

2905.079 --> 2908.7400000000002
indicators almost like an astrological

2907.3 --> 2913.059
map

2908.74 --> 2916.359
of what is most likely to have preceded

2913.059 --> 2919.7200000000003
that psychologically emotionally it's

2916.359 --> 2922.24
all mapped out it's crazy and

2919.72 --> 2924.52
like it's kind of shocking how well it

2922.24 --> 2927.0989999999997
works

2924.52 --> 2929.2599999999998
especially if you trust it

2927.099 --> 2931.54
it's like if you trust it it becomes

2929.26 --> 2934.26
even more consistent

2931.54 --> 2937.96
and you start to retract your

2934.26 --> 2940.42
standardized internal Reliance on all

2937.96 --> 2942.2200000000003
these mechanisms that we have been

2940.42 --> 2945.339
growing up into

2942.22 --> 2947.98
just like you're no longer afraid I I

2945.339 --> 2951.18
literally won't go to the doctor now

2947.98 --> 2951.18
I'm not afraid anymore

2951.46 --> 2956.92
and I also realized that I can basically

2954.4 --> 2959.92
I don't have to go to the dentist either

2956.92 --> 2960.94
I mean it could be kind of nice

2959.92 --> 2963.4
but

2960.94 --> 2965.5
way back I would go to the desk because

2963.4 --> 2967.359
like oh I have a toothache I'm afraid

2965.5 --> 2970.119
I'm going to have a problem I'm not

2967.359 --> 2973.0
afraid anymore I know now what that is

2970.119 --> 2975.2200000000003
and I know that even teeth

2973.0 --> 2976.78
like yeah there will be pain but

2975.22 --> 2980.0789999999997
everybody will experience pain in

2976.78 --> 2983.619
reflection to the world

2980.079 --> 2986.92
people giving you a toothache that's not

2983.619 --> 2989.8
just a vague figure of speech people

2986.92 --> 2992.44
all these typical problems come in

2989.8 --> 2995.8590000000004
response it's like as the second the

2992.44 --> 2997.78
body's response to the spirit

2995.859 --> 3000.66
so these things happen I'm not afraid

2997.78 --> 3002.8190000000004
anymore I can if I have a toothache

3000.66 --> 3004.5589999999997
somewhere now I just sit through it I'm

3002.819 --> 3005.88
not afraid I don't even take pain

3004.559 --> 3008.579
medication

3005.88 --> 3010.98
although yeah

3008.579 --> 3012.42
when I was still with my ex one time it

3010.98 --> 3015.66
got so bad

3012.42 --> 3019.319
that like the pain was excruciating but

3015.66 --> 3020.94
that's also because in that very period

3019.319 --> 3024.18
of time

3020.94 --> 3027.42
I was basically Fallen

3024.18 --> 3028.44
because my girlfriend had broken up with

3027.42 --> 3030.66
me

3028.44 --> 3033.42
and we were still living together and I

3030.66 --> 3036.42
was trying to like uh how do I recover

3033.42 --> 3039.9
this how do I fix this and it was really

3036.42 --> 3043.02
demoralized so it's very likely that it

3039.9 --> 3046.14
even got this bad specifically in

3043.02 --> 3047.28
response to that state of being at the

3046.14 --> 3050.0
time

3047.28 --> 3050.0
yes

3051.599 --> 3057.54
right so the main point of it all is to

3055.44 --> 3060.3
make sure you don't end up in such

3057.54 --> 3062.819
Corners because that's when your your

3060.3 --> 3065.119
body's gonna [ __ ] you up you see that's

3062.819 --> 3067.859
when the punishment comes from your body

3065.119 --> 3070.02
because you screwed up

3067.859 --> 3072.48
you screwed up your life you didn't have

3070.02 --> 3074.3
control and you ended up in a place

3072.48 --> 3076.7400000000002
where you don't know what to do anymore

3074.3 --> 3079.38
and that's the worst that's when your

3076.74 --> 3082.2
body starts punishing you

3079.38 --> 3085.88
that's what I have learned from my

3082.2 --> 3085.8799999999997
experiences in the last 10 years

3085.92 --> 3089.94
and I've taken a lot of punishment

3087.78 --> 3093.48
because of my incompetence in the past

3089.94 --> 3096.18
through my body and it's mostly restored

3093.48 --> 3098.46
now and I feel like I've even restored

3096.18 --> 3102.5589999999997
from those issues then which is exactly

3098.46 --> 3102.559
what German new medicine tells you it is

3103.02 --> 3110.96
right so I might still go to a dentist

3106.079 --> 3110.96
but it would rather be like cosmetic

3113.46 --> 3118.38
right

3115.079 --> 3120.3590000000004
just to make chewing a little easier but

3118.38 --> 3122.7000000000003
it's not like oh no I might have a

3120.359 --> 3125.2799999999997
gravity and [ __ ] that

3122.7 --> 3128.9399999999996
this is all natural like that kind of

3125.28 --> 3130.3190000000004
thing it it can go away it just goes

3128.94 --> 3133.76
away

3130.319 --> 3133.7599999999998
it restores itself

3133.92 --> 3137.119
I'm not afraid anymore

3140.5 --> 3144.96
[Music]

3142.079 --> 3147.78
why do you have brownish teeth

3144.96 --> 3149.94
uh I don't

3147.78 --> 3152.3390000000004
I don't have brownish teeth and for

3149.94 --> 3154.079
somebody in their 40s my teeth are

3152.339 --> 3155.5789999999997
pretty damn good

3154.079 --> 3158.46
all right

3155.579 --> 3161.28
I brush my teeth regularly

3158.46 --> 3163.319
but I'm also a smoker

3161.28 --> 3166.5
yeah I smoke

3163.319 --> 3168.42
that yeah that's gonna colorize my teeth

3166.5 --> 3173.28
slightly

3168.42 --> 3177.2400000000002
but my teeth are really not that

3173.28 --> 3179.8390000000004
freaking brown or [ __ ] right don't don't

3177.24 --> 3179.839
do that

3193.339 --> 3200.339
now I smoke joints

3197.339 --> 3203.72
but yeah with tobacco and that's really

3200.339 --> 3203.72
the thing that kind of does that

3218.22 --> 3221.0589999999997
ew

3221.22 --> 3227.4599999999996
oh the new drugs came here oh yeah sure

3230.339 --> 3235.68
hey hey hey Fight The Mirage Earth yeah

3233.28 --> 3237.78
yeah yeah yeah oh you you like those

3235.68 --> 3239.46
drugs so much do you

3237.78 --> 3244.0400000000004
oh

3239.46 --> 3244.04
yeah you know that feelings age right

3244.38 --> 3248.28
did you also know that I have certain

3247.079 --> 3250.98
feelings

3248.28 --> 3253.5
that are literally being pushed out of

3250.98 --> 3255.359
my teeth you know why because it's

3253.5 --> 3258.48
regenerating

3255.359 --> 3262.2799999999997
yeah it's regenerating my teeth are

3258.48 --> 3262.28
literally like regrowing

3262.98 --> 3268.559
yeah so so keep letting that dances

3265.859 --> 3269.88
constantly screw around with your teeth

3268.559 --> 3271.8
everywhere

3269.88 --> 3273.6600000000003
sure that's gonna be all right right

3271.8 --> 3276.1800000000003
it's not like you're going to have to

3273.66 --> 3278.3999999999996
have dentist maintenance the rest of

3276.18 --> 3281.46
your life until you die

3278.4 --> 3284.04
because of you like it so much and all

3281.46 --> 3286.2
all that drugs they inject you oh it's

3284.04 --> 3287.7599999999998
so quick it's so easy oh yeah you think

3286.2 --> 3290.3999999999996
that's healthy

3287.76 --> 3292.7990000000004
said it's still not healthy stuff it's

3290.4 --> 3295.319
still something it's not good

3292.799 --> 3298.079
it might be more effective

3295.319 --> 3300.0589999999997
right not telling you to like okay if

3298.079 --> 3302.88
you're gonna go to the dentist yeah of

3300.059 --> 3306.119
course you're gonna take

3302.88 --> 3308.099
you're not gonna sit through I

3306.119 --> 3309.2400000000002
I actually had

3308.099 --> 3311.52
yeah

3309.24 --> 3312.66
one time I let a dentist do his thing

3311.52 --> 3315.54
without

3312.66 --> 3319.46
pain medication

3315.54 --> 3319.46
that was a big mistake

3320.54 --> 3324.5
so yeah I get that

3324.839 --> 3330.18
wow okay you can

3327.78 --> 3333.3190000000004
go out bye

3330.18 --> 3333.319
see you later man

3343.559 --> 3348.0
yeah so

3345.54 --> 3351.119
yeah I did that once because I thought

3348.0 --> 3354.119
no I can do that uh no I couldn't I mean

3351.119 --> 3357.299
I actually had it done but afterward I

3354.119 --> 3360.2000000000003
was literally just like

3357.299 --> 3360.2
ow

3360.66 --> 3369.0789999999997
it's like I was literally trembling

3364.98 --> 3372.96
because I felt like I had just waking

3369.079 --> 3377.8390000000004
brain surgeon from the inside it was

3372.96 --> 3377.839
really really painful don't yeah

3378.48 --> 3384.7400000000002
but the thing is I'm just not going to a

3382.2 --> 3384.74
dentist anymore

3385.2 --> 3390.1189999999997
I'm just not doing it I'm just letting

3387.299 --> 3393.359
my teeth do whatever is necessary and

3390.119 --> 3396.7200000000003
I might still go to a dentist someday

3393.359 --> 3399.72
for some cosmetic issue and like the

3396.72 --> 3402.1189999999997
notice the the plaque that builds up the

3399.72 --> 3404.7
it's like this chalky stuff

3402.119 --> 3406.079
I can't really remove that just by tooth

3404.7 --> 3408.0
brushing

3406.079 --> 3409.8590000000004
so that would be kind of nice to get

3408.0 --> 3412.98
that out

3409.859 --> 3416.22
but it's not like

3412.98 --> 3419.099
like it's really terrible situation out

3416.22 --> 3421.04
there I've been to a dentist since my ex

3419.099 --> 3425.0
which is like

3421.04 --> 3425.0
eight nine years ago

3435.18 --> 3441.359
to be very smoking every day might be

3438.72 --> 3443.839
less healthy than it yeah

3441.359 --> 3443.839
sure

3444.599 --> 3448.1600000000003
but it's a lot more fun

3449.339 --> 3454.7
do you use natural type yes fluoride

3452.339 --> 3454.7
free

3455.22 --> 3459.54
this is weirdly enough my toothpaste

3457.319 --> 3460.98
from Denmark

3459.54 --> 3464.88
but

3460.98 --> 3468.44
yeah it's it's okay it's really tough to

3464.88 --> 3468.44
find a good toothpaste it is

3470.579 --> 3477.3590000000004
I used like the Infowars toothpaste

3474.54 --> 3481.92
before that I really love that one but

3477.359 --> 3485.46
then Alex started to whine like a

3481.92 --> 3488.76
freaking [ __ ] about how oh colonial

3485.46 --> 3490.26
silver works against coven yeah and then

3488.76 --> 3492.78
he got his toothpaste canceled because

3490.26 --> 3495.9
he was a stupid ass

3492.78 --> 3498.2400000000002
and he knows it I really hope that he

3495.9 --> 3502.52
still feels the punishment of that

3498.24 --> 3502.52
idiocy that he committed back then

3502.98 --> 3507.54
purely his own fault

3505.2 --> 3510.24
so that toothpaste was canceled and then

3507.54 --> 3512.4
like his dad or something like came out

3510.24 --> 3515.16
with another like charcoal toothpaste

3512.4 --> 3517.319
and now there's a coral toothpaste

3515.16 --> 3519.299
whatever I think that those will

3517.319 --> 3523.22
probably be pretty good but I haven't

3519.299 --> 3523.22
like tested them out yet

3526.44 --> 3533.099
but yeah that old stuff was amazing and

3529.74 --> 3535.74
iodine a colloidal silver in it it was

3533.099 --> 3539.299
great tea tree oil I loved that it was

3535.74 --> 3539.299
the perfect toothpaste perfect

3570.92 --> 3575.819
yeah that's right flutter Sage I agree I

3574.26 --> 3579.2400000000002
think that

3575.819 --> 3581.72
overall like healthcare should be like

3579.24 --> 3584.9399999999996
radically

3581.72 --> 3587.7599999999998
rearranged but yeah first the medical

3584.94 --> 3590.46
industrial complex just has to burst it

3587.76 --> 3593.099
has to be destroyed pretty much it is

3590.46 --> 3595.2
self-destroying

3593.099 --> 3597.92
because we don't need giant

3595.2 --> 3597.9199999999996
organizations

3598.079 --> 3604.92
and huge laboratory like privatized

3601.94 --> 3607.91
corporate Laboratories that's absolutely

3604.92 --> 3609.54
not in anybody's favorite

3607.91 --> 3612.42
[Music]

3609.54 --> 3615.54
what we need instead is just a holistic

3612.42 --> 3619.6800000000003
approach with a whole bunch of doctors

3615.54 --> 3621.72
that can follow their own studies

3619.68 --> 3623.339
that there's a massive amount of choice

3621.72 --> 3626.04
and then hey

3623.339 --> 3628.799
if you really need something you just

3626.04 --> 3630.7799999999997
save up and invest in it it's better to

3628.799 --> 3633.54
just have

3630.78 --> 3636.2400000000002
more prosperity and then people that

3633.54 --> 3637.799
just save up for medical things so they

3636.24 --> 3640.4399999999996
take it serious

3637.799 --> 3643.2599999999998
and that the doctors will actually be

3640.44 --> 3645.7200000000003
like yeah that guy actually has the

3643.26 --> 3648.559
money if I do my job right I will get

3645.72 --> 3648.5589999999997
that money right

3649.14 --> 3652.4
because insurance

3657.78 --> 3664.5
right maybe for like a general like

3661.559 --> 3667.44
accident policy Insurance something

3664.5 --> 3669.059
right because somebody gets in a really

3667.44 --> 3670.859
serious accident there's like no way

3669.059 --> 3673.1400000000003
they could ever you you don't anticipate

3670.859 --> 3676.92
saving up for that

3673.14 --> 3680.64
but for like General Health maintenance

3676.92 --> 3684.2400000000002
I think that should be like

3680.64 --> 3686.339
yeah it's much more important that just

3684.24 --> 3687.7799999999997
the money is freed up for people and

3686.339 --> 3689.7599999999998
that they can make their own choice in

3687.78 --> 3691.8590000000004
it

3689.76 --> 3694.44
and take it serious and then the doctors

3691.859 --> 3696.359
will perform better because they're

3694.44 --> 3697.44
dealing with people that literally have

3696.359 --> 3699.7799999999997
the money

3697.44 --> 3702.48
and it's not just another number on a

3699.78 --> 3704.4
list while the insurance company just

3702.48 --> 3707.76
guarantees their pay

3704.4 --> 3710.9
that system is sucks it makes doctors

3707.76 --> 3710.9
more apathetic

3721.68 --> 3724.0989999999997
okay

3747.359 --> 3752.72
is for free no in Europe it just sucks

3756.119 --> 3762.119
if it's for free that means it it's

3759.48 --> 3764.039
gonna be a death system there there are

3762.119 --> 3766.02
no things for free for that fight to

3764.039 --> 3767.94
Mirage Earth there are no things for

3766.02 --> 3770.94
free if it's free

3767.94 --> 3774.799
that means that they're basic it's

3770.94 --> 3774.799
becoming a lottery then

3775.74 --> 3778.339
right

3779.76 --> 3787.3190000000004
because free means that the system will

3784.2 --> 3790.6189999999997
save money on just killing you having

3787.319 --> 3793.14
you killed you understand that becomes

3790.619 --> 3796.4
the profit then

3793.14 --> 3796.4
there is no free

3798.26 --> 3805.079
Medical Care means they will kill you to

3802.98 --> 3806.099
save themselves money that's what that

3805.079 --> 3809.6600000000003
means

3806.099 --> 3809.6600000000003
I hope you understand that

3819.839 --> 3825.9
they don't kill people right quick now

3823.5 --> 3827.28
what the [ __ ] world do you live in you

3825.9 --> 3829.5
[ __ ]

3827.28 --> 3833.48
have you paid any attention to anything

3829.5 --> 3833.48
in this world in the last two years

3834.9 --> 3841.319
Jesus Christ man are you a butt or

3838.2 --> 3844.2
something like no there's no person in

3841.319 --> 3846.799
the world no actual person that could be

3844.2 --> 3846.799
that stupid

3858.299 --> 3862.98
hey I didn't insult you

3860.94 --> 3866.099
uh

3862.98 --> 3868.44
yeah you did you insulted everybody's

3866.099 --> 3870.7200000000003
intellect by saying they don't kill

3868.44 --> 3875.16
people oh really they don't so what's

3870.72 --> 3875.16
been happening last two years yeah

3875.7 --> 3880.319
they don't kill it dude

3877.98 --> 3883.579
that's an insult that's an insult to

3880.319 --> 3883.579
everybody's intellect

3907.319 --> 3912.0
yeah yeah Fight The Mirage Earth I

3909.839 --> 3913.92
already explained it to you yes I know

3912.0 --> 3916.38
they take money out of people's paycheck

3913.92 --> 3920.039
the thing is though

3916.38 --> 3923.46
is that because of that system

3920.039 --> 3927.3590000000004
the doctors the ones being paid

3923.46 --> 3930.96
they just get paid they no longer

3927.359 --> 3934.14
will have like personal interest in the

3930.96 --> 3936.66
people they treat because they the

3934.14 --> 3942.0589999999997
people they treat won't be holding the

3936.66 --> 3945.98
money that they will want to end up with

3942.059 --> 3949.3190000000004
yeah it's gonna make the doctors

3945.98 --> 3952.859
standardized more apathetic because they

3949.319 --> 3955.619
have no more direct connection

3952.859 --> 3957.0
to their patients because their patients

3955.619 --> 3959.6400000000003
are not the ones that are going to

3957.0 --> 3962.339
provide them with the money the system

3959.64 --> 3966.68
will and the people just have to pay

3962.339 --> 3966.68
anyway no matter what you see

3980.76 --> 3985.099
thank you for taking care of that Kepler

3995.28 --> 3998.2400000000002
foreign

4014.96 --> 4019.819
right so I hope you got that point

4018.26 --> 4021.98
that I've been trying to make there

4019.819 --> 4025.4
Fight The Mirage Earth and Emma po I

4021.98 --> 4028.28
hope you listen to what I just said

4025.4 --> 4030.559
and allowed yourself to realize that I'm

4028.28 --> 4033.579
right about that that's how it

4030.559 --> 4033.579
effectively works

4034.819 --> 4040.7599999999998
if doctors don't have

4037.46 --> 4043.16
a direct responsibility

4040.76 --> 4045.3190000000004
to the ones they're Trading

4043.16 --> 4049.0389999999998
for their money that they will get out

4045.319 --> 4052.339
of it then they will become less

4049.039 --> 4054.8590000000004
and less interested in their patients

4052.339 --> 4056.5389999999998
welfare like if there they might still

4054.859 --> 4058.88
be really good doctors they might want

4056.539 --> 4060.44
to do it for the others right

4058.88 --> 4062.7200000000003
but

4060.44 --> 4064.339
they might not

4062.72 --> 4066.5589999999997
as well

4064.339 --> 4068.839
because what's going to stop them if

4066.559 --> 4072.3190000000004
they don't care they don't care it

4068.839 --> 4075.2599999999998
doesn't have any consequence for them

4072.319 --> 4077.48
well unless they like like mock off of

4075.26 --> 4079.9
course right they're still held to task

4077.48 --> 4079.9
on that

4085.039 --> 4090.3190000000004
but like they're not going to be

4087.38 --> 4093.799
inclined to necessarily provide the best

4090.319 --> 4095.96
treatment to people they'll just they'll

4093.799 --> 4098.659
be more inclined to give the easiest

4095.96 --> 4100.94
cheapest solution because that's what

4098.659 --> 4102.799
the health insurance wants

4100.94 --> 4105.0199999999995
because they don't want to pay that

4102.799 --> 4108.0199999999995
money health insurance actually doesn't

4105.02 --> 4110.659000000001
want to pay money for people to get

4108.02 --> 4112.580000000001
better the people would like to spend

4110.659 --> 4114.199
money to get better

4112.58 --> 4116.299
the health insurances don't want that

4114.199 --> 4119.299
they want the opposite it's really

4116.299 --> 4119.299
counterproductive

4134.359 --> 4139.159000000001
unless

4136.279 --> 4140.839000000001
all of it is voluntary unless nobody has

4139.159 --> 4143.839
to pay

4140.839 --> 4146.54
for the health care of others by force

4143.839 --> 4148.759
taken out of their paycheck and people

4146.54 --> 4150.56
either save up their own money or they

4148.759 --> 4153.14
get their own private health insurance

4150.56 --> 4154.52
Private health insurance is going to be

4153.14 --> 4157.819
inclined

4154.52 --> 4160.52
to actually have the patient's best

4157.819 --> 4163.159000000001
interest at heart right because if they

4160.52 --> 4166.6990000000005
don't do that then the patient's gonna

4163.159 --> 4168.5599999999995
stop using their health insurance is

4166.699 --> 4171.3189999999995
going to move on to another

4168.56 --> 4174.759
and then they lose that money yeah

4171.319 --> 4174.759
that's more effective

4190.94 --> 4194.379999999999
right anyways

4204.73 --> 4207.839999999999
[Music]

4213.62 --> 4217.229
[Music]

4221.0 --> 4224.56
yes Emma Peel I know

4226.28 --> 4230.5
the same's over here in the Netherlands

4231.159 --> 4238.58
right it's kind of weird because I am on

4235.1 --> 4240.620000000001
social welfare I get reimbursed for my

4238.58 --> 4243.38
health insurance but I still have to pay

4240.62 --> 4245.36
that like I've already even like stated

4243.38 --> 4247.76
like I don't even want health insurance

4245.36 --> 4250.179
I just don't want to have anything to do

4247.76 --> 4250.179
with this

4252.44 --> 4258.799999999999
but yeah every month I get an extra

4255.64 --> 4261.64
piece of money and then I get the check

4258.8 --> 4261.64
for the health insurance

4264.56 --> 4269.659000000001
and I never do anything with it

4267.56 --> 4273.14
because even if I try to do something

4269.659 --> 4276.28
with it I'd still end up paying because

4273.14 --> 4276.280000000001
it sucks

4277.4 --> 4284.299999999999
the system sucks

4280.58 --> 4286.94
forced Health Care sucks everything

4284.3 --> 4289.159000000001
about it sucks it's always terrible

4286.94 --> 4292.839999999999
always

4289.159 --> 4292.839999999999
nothing is good about it

4315.32 --> 4320.84
right you want free healthcare

4318.199 --> 4322.639999999999
figure it out yourself why didn't you

4320.84 --> 4324.860000000001
become your own doctor that's what I've

4322.64 --> 4328.159000000001
done partially

4324.86 --> 4330.199
still yeah not a real doctor replacement

4328.159 --> 4332.9
by any measure

4330.199 --> 4335.9
but I've at least studied upon a whole

4332.9 --> 4339.44
bunch of alternatives

4335.9 --> 4342.799999999999
and there is a lot of Alternatives that

4339.44 --> 4345.08
are very effective and very different

4342.8 --> 4347.900000000001
like German new medicine it's just one

4345.08 --> 4350.8
little thing that's not little it's one

4347.9 --> 4350.799999999999
cornerstone thing

4351.44 --> 4357.379999999999
just do it yourself take care of your

4355.04 --> 4361.28
own health try to figure out how to

4357.38 --> 4365.0
resolve your body bodily issues

4361.28 --> 4366.8
make a plan for the long run like how is

4365.0 --> 4369.44
your body going to develop over times

4366.8 --> 4372.38
how is it going to break down what are

4369.44 --> 4375.919999999999
you going to do in anticipation for that

4372.38 --> 4378.86
be your own doctor that's the only real

4375.92 --> 4381.34
and effective free health care you're

4378.86 --> 4381.339999999999
gonna get

4381.5 --> 4384.46
do it yourself

4402.32 --> 4404.86
right

4405.14 --> 4410.84
could you'd be surprised

4407.78 --> 4414.62
how much you can change things for the

4410.84 --> 4418.76
better which is very little

4414.62 --> 4420.98
and like with very little cost and all

4418.76 --> 4423.4400000000005
you need to do is just have some careful

4420.98 --> 4426.32
attention and

4423.44 --> 4431.62
like never panic but always read the

4426.32 --> 4431.62
signs never Panic always read the signs

4435.199 --> 4440.299999999999
what's going on in your body how your

4437.659 --> 4442.4
body's responding to things

4440.3 --> 4444.56
how are you in general and your

4442.4 --> 4447.139999999999
psychology is responding to the outside

4444.56 --> 4451.3
world always always

4447.14 --> 4451.3
pay attention never panic

4451.76 --> 4455.659000000001
and you'll figure it out you'll figure

4453.679 --> 4459.32
out how you work how your energy

4455.659 --> 4461.48
oscillates what your natural rhythm is

4459.32 --> 4463.4
and then you will

4461.48 --> 4466.299999999999
just be able to manage yourself

4463.4 --> 4466.299999999999
correctly

4479.48 --> 4482.739
yeah I hate getting wisdom

4485.42 --> 4491.06
yeah that's good to hear flutter Sage

4487.699 --> 4494.0599999999995
medicinal herbs is a great study

4491.06 --> 4496.76
it's an old study but it's great and it

4494.06 --> 4500.14
it's not even just medicinal it's it's

4496.76 --> 4500.14
good for so many things

4502.76 --> 4510.320000000001
and hey like just growing plants working

4506.84 --> 4513.679
with plants is is a great thing on its

4510.32 --> 4515.0599999999995
own I find it therapeutic just to do

4513.679 --> 4519.1990000000005
that I

4515.06 --> 4522.92
like I have this oregano plant and I

4519.199 --> 4527.659
really don't like cutting leaves off it

4522.92 --> 4532.3
because I just love that plant

4527.659 --> 4532.299999999999
it's been with me for several years now

4535.82 --> 4541.28
but I know that if I would take like a

4538.94 --> 4543.94
a part of it it would be absolutely

4541.28 --> 4543.94
delicious

4563.719 --> 4570.7390000000005
right so yeah having a medicinal herb

4567.08 --> 4575.3
garden is a win-win-win situation like

4570.739 --> 4579.259999999999
there is no loss having that in any way

4575.3 --> 4582.8
always a win it's therapeutic

4579.26 --> 4586.219
it's medicinal it's delicious

4582.8 --> 4589.34
uh yeah and you're gonna be more

4586.219 --> 4593.38
self-reliant and you might might

4589.34 --> 4593.38
be able to help other people as well

4593.96 --> 4598.3
if you choose to and if they choose to

4605.3 --> 4613.179
what what's a Hippocratic Oath you don't

4609.14 --> 4613.179
know that I'm appeal what

4613.34 --> 4620.179
the Hippocratic Oath that's the oath

4616.64 --> 4625.64
to never do any harm

4620.179 --> 4628.9400000000005
it's like an oath to to him yeah to God

4625.64 --> 4630.62
to always use your medical knowledge for

4628.94 --> 4633.139999999999
the betterment

4630.62 --> 4637.099999999999
and for the restoration

4633.14 --> 4641.320000000001
and never to abuse it for anything else

4637.1 --> 4641.320000000001
like power or control

4646.219 --> 4649.94
that's the Hippocratic Oath it's very

4648.199 --> 4652.219
it's a key factor

4649.94 --> 4654.199
used to be extremely important it's the

4652.219 --> 4656.0
Hippocratic oath I think that even in

4654.199 --> 4659.0599999999995
Western Society

4656.0 --> 4661.64
allowed people to gain some basic level

4659.06 --> 4664.400000000001
of trust in doctors

4661.64 --> 4666.56
have to remember that like medieval

4664.4 --> 4671.44
times and before like people had a lot

4666.56 --> 4671.4400000000005
of distrust for doctory types

4673.699 --> 4679.4
because they were seeing like oh it's a

4675.86 --> 4682.94
weirdo witchy stuff and I don't know

4679.4 --> 4686.599999999999
but the Hippocratic Oath just was like

4682.94 --> 4688.699
okay well it might be creepy but at

4686.6 --> 4692.320000000001
least they did the Hippocratic Oath so

4688.699 --> 4692.32
they're not allowed to do any harm

4695.62 --> 4701.12
optional

4697.34 --> 4705.14
it's absolutely absurd the animation

4701.12 --> 4709.78
like who the hell greenlighted that

4705.14 --> 4709.780000000001
who the [ __ ] did that

4710.3 --> 4716.42
who the hell in their mind would

4713.96 --> 4719.179
green light

4716.42 --> 4723.58
doctors Hippocratic Oath taking to be

4719.179 --> 4723.58
optional this is insane

4749.719 --> 4755.4800000000005
but yes aramic I've heard of that I

4752.179 --> 4758.3
don't know if it's in the Netherlands

4755.48 --> 4759.739
as well I'm not sure I don't know I I

4758.3 --> 4762.56
don't

4759.739 --> 4764.98
yeah I don't have I don't go to a doctor

4762.56 --> 4764.9800000000005
anymore

4773.0 --> 4777.8
Nazis would yeah

4775.219 --> 4780.199
no but I was actually Jeff gas I was

4777.8 --> 4781.64
actually asking a specific question who

4780.199 --> 4783.919999999999
actually

4781.64 --> 4786.56
must probably be through government who

4783.92 --> 4789.1990000000005
actually greenlighted like okay

4786.56 --> 4790.820000000001
doctors taking the Hippocratic Oath is

4789.199 --> 4795.28
now optional

4790.82 --> 4795.28
who the hell greenlighted that

4796.28 --> 4803.3
which individual which group of people

4798.76 --> 4806.900000000001
where's the document that they signed

4803.3 --> 4810.38
because they need to be

4806.9 --> 4814.219
like seriously taken under the loop

4810.38 --> 4817.6990000000005
because that's a terrible terrible thing

4814.219 --> 4818.9
like there is no good no good that can

4817.699 --> 4822.0199999999995
come out of that

4818.9 --> 4827.54
and hey look at the world around you huh

4822.02 --> 4829.34
huh oh medical lockdown yeah yeah

4827.54 --> 4831.88
why do you how do you think that came

4829.34 --> 4831.88
into being

4832.52 --> 4836.360000000001
yeah it's because there's people in the

4834.739 --> 4838.339999999999
system in the medical system now that

4836.36 --> 4839.599999999999
don't have to take the hypocritical so

4838.34 --> 4841.34
they're gonna

4839.6 --> 4845.42
they're going to be there for other

4841.34 --> 4847.84
reasons as well huh Mickey make a big

4845.42 --> 4847.84
profit

4848.42 --> 4853.6
yeah so who the hell greenlighted that

4856.88 --> 4861.679
right Matthew Hall yeah sadistic minded

4859.52 --> 4863.780000000001
political but I I'm actually asking

4861.679 --> 4866.96
specifics I wanna because that have to

4863.78 --> 4869.48
be actual individuals in the past maybe

4866.96 --> 4872.42
they're not too distant past

4869.48 --> 4876.138999999999
who literally signed that so who was

4872.42 --> 4878.96
that who the hell signed that

4876.139 --> 4880.639
in England and in the Netherlands too if

4878.96 --> 4882.02
that's the case here I don't know if it

4880.639 --> 4884.12
is for sure

4882.02 --> 4886.159000000001
who greenlighted that

4884.12 --> 4888.62
because they they must be taken under

4886.159 --> 4890.839999999999
the loop

4888.62 --> 4892.5199999999995
it could almost State at this point

4890.84 --> 4894.56
although it feels a little political

4892.52 --> 4897.400000000001
that they are kind of partially

4894.56 --> 4897.400000000001
responsible

4897.44 --> 4901.96
for the crisis that we are under

4902.48 --> 4909.379999999999
not because they necessarily caused it

4905.48 --> 4912.259999999999
but because they created

4909.38 --> 4913.639
that yeah they eroded

4912.26 --> 4917.6
that

4913.639 --> 4920.84
the the pure good willing nature

4917.6 --> 4923.54
of the medical system doing that

4920.84 --> 4925.76
so who who green lighted it I want to

4923.54 --> 4928.96
know I want I actually kind of want you

4925.76 --> 4928.96
guys to kind of find out

4955.94 --> 4961.879999999999
it would have been passed by yeah right

4959.36 --> 4963.5
so who are these 200 politicians then

4961.88 --> 4965.2390000000005
Matthew Hall

4963.5 --> 4968.179
that's right

4965.239 --> 4971.299999999999
there's two if it dude I don't care if

4968.179 --> 4973.4
it was a hundred thousand people spread

4971.3 --> 4977.38
over the world that did it

4973.4 --> 4980.5599999999995
they should be put on a list and then

4977.38 --> 4980.56
investigate it

4981.02 --> 4986.38
why the hell did you sign on to that

4998.179 --> 5000.36
foreign

5203.38 --> 5209.6990000000005
still building that and I currently

5206.02 --> 5213.159000000001
don't really have any like re yeah

5209.699 --> 5216.219
anything I could do about that

5213.159 --> 5219.219
it would be great though because I I

5216.219 --> 5221.92
will run into trouble like in in a few

5219.219 --> 5224.56
months like I might get into pretty

5221.92 --> 5226.84
serious trouble financially

5224.56 --> 5227.92
so yeah I really hope that you guys

5226.84 --> 5230.7390000000005
couldn't

5227.92 --> 5233.56
support me

5230.739 --> 5235.919999999999
just little bits at a time but hopefully

5233.56 --> 5235.92
more

5236.38 --> 5241.4800000000005
so I can get away some of this debt

5238.54 --> 5243.659
before like I get really big fines for

5241.48 --> 5243.659
that

5244.48 --> 5252.218999999999
so is the earth still flat then oh yes

5248.08 --> 5254.139
always was and always will be flat

5252.219 --> 5256.12
I mean I think that if the Earth could

5254.139 --> 5258.9400000000005
have ever been a ball God would probably

5256.12 --> 5261.599999999999
have just made it a ball

5258.94 --> 5261.599999999999
because

5262.6 --> 5266.9800000000005
yeah people really like to believe that

5266.02 --> 5269.820000000001
anyway

5266.98 --> 5269.82
apparently

5271.54 --> 5276.04
so that would make things a lot easier

5273.88 --> 5279.6
although yeah does God want to make

5276.04 --> 5279.6
things a lot easier though you know

5286.38 --> 5292.32
because the ball seems just very

5289.719 --> 5292.32
tenacious

5294.4 --> 5297.599999999999
despite everything

5298.179 --> 5302.56
trolls love balls right

5320.44 --> 5323.04
hmm

5326.739 --> 5330.58
right but yeah the fact remains the

5329.02 --> 5333.34
Earth is in the ball

5330.58 --> 5335.739
it's very flat and if it hadn't been

5333.34 --> 5338.139
flat then the ball model could have

5335.739 --> 5340.0
never been mathematically created as it

5338.139 --> 5342.639
has been

5340.0 --> 5346.62
because it's all based

5342.639 --> 5346.62
on the Earth being flat

5346.739 --> 5353.04
geometrically mathematically

5350.32 --> 5353.04
practically

5361.96 --> 5367.1
is it

5364.56 --> 5370.749000000001
blue it's a glue

5367.1 --> 5370.749000000001
[Music]

5372.04 --> 5375.94
because you say so

5374.08 --> 5379.739
that's brilliant man

5375.94 --> 5379.739
oh don't delete that

5381.639 --> 5384.2390000000005
come on

5387.219 --> 5391.02
I could have a back and forth that

5394.96 --> 5400.7390000000005
I mean I appreciate the moderation but

5397.36 --> 5400.739
that's yeah

5402.159 --> 5407.08
I want to hear his reasoning

5404.92 --> 5409.54
if he has any

5407.08 --> 5413.5
and if he doesn't have any just had has

5409.54 --> 5419.26
at home then yeah then I'll ban him but

5413.5 --> 5420.639
just so it's a globe you say really

5419.26 --> 5423.84
how

5420.639 --> 5423.84
how is it a globe

5426.1 --> 5432.46
how could it be a globe it can't be a

5429.219 --> 5435.4800000000005
globe if it was a globe then your Globe

5432.46 --> 5435.4800000000005
math wouldn't work

5449.58 --> 5454.78
no it's okay Matthew Hall I appreciate

5452.08 --> 5457.54
it you were very helpful the other day

5454.78 --> 5461.139
when just the raping Stark raving mad

5457.54 --> 5464.94
troll just that kept spamming so don't

5461.139 --> 5464.9400000000005
worry about it you're good

5468.04 --> 5472.5
but this doesn't seem to be that that

5470.199 --> 5472.5
guy

5473.62 --> 5479.98
it yeah this might actually just be an

5476.32 --> 5483.9
algorithm to keep me going or something

5479.98 --> 5483.9
unbandem is not saying anything

5484.36 --> 5489.339999999999
so is this just like a standard chat

5486.699 --> 5491.879999999999
input to kind of trigger me to keep

5489.34 --> 5491.88
rolling

5492.04 --> 5496.3
I mean I'm kind of fine with that but

5494.44 --> 5498.46
I'm much more interested in in just

5496.3 --> 5500.5
actual Globe Believers and like what

5498.46 --> 5502.4800000000005
what drives you

5500.5 --> 5505.08
what drives you to get in my chat here

5502.48 --> 5505.08
and say that

5513.699 --> 5520.12
is no Billy rappola I'm not worried

5517.6 --> 5522.58
about your double think denial

5520.12 --> 5524.739
projection

5522.58 --> 5526.84
people that live in the Reversed world

5524.739 --> 5528.28
of everything don't worry me in the

5526.84 --> 5531.219
slightest

5528.28 --> 5533.5599999999995
you're the one that's literally just

5531.219 --> 5535.9
out of your mind

5533.56 --> 5538.679
it's not a threat to me it's not a worry

5535.9 --> 5538.679
about anything

5539.08 --> 5543.6
because you don't understand what proof

5541.48 --> 5543.599999999999
is

5544.0 --> 5550.48
you mean tons of paper that just blabber

5547.6 --> 5553.360000000001
on about how it's evolved but every time

5550.48 --> 5555.459999999999
fail to actually prove it it just makes

5553.36 --> 5559.9
you presuppose everything presuppose

5555.46 --> 5562.38
gravity presuppose a radius value

5559.9 --> 5562.379999999999
right

5562.6 --> 5567.400000000001
that's the math that's how that's your

5565.179 --> 5570.4
proof the proof is that everything about

5567.4 --> 5573.638999999999
the ball Earth is presupposed

5570.4 --> 5576.299999999999
which isn't actual proof it's a mind

5573.639 --> 5576.3
experiment

5578.98 --> 5585.58
yeah so there is giant amount of mind

5581.8 --> 5588.58
experiments on how the Earth is a ball

5585.58 --> 5591.5199999999995
or rather if like if the Earth was a

5588.58 --> 5593.5599999999995
ball how would things be and the

5591.52 --> 5596.02
preponderance of your information of

5593.56 --> 5598.54
your book works

5596.02 --> 5601.0
right or just that

5598.54 --> 5602.26
this is how the Earth would be if it was

5601.0 --> 5604.3
a ball yeah

5602.26 --> 5606.1
it isn't though

5604.3 --> 5608.679
it really isn't

5606.1 --> 5611.4400000000005
because if you actually dig into the

5608.679 --> 5613.96
mathematics of all this modeling

5611.44 --> 5615.5199999999995
then you will find out that it only

5613.96 --> 5617.82
works

5615.52 --> 5621.280000000001
that it was set up

5617.82 --> 5622.96
effectively only because the Earth is

5621.28 --> 5627.94
actually a flat

5622.96 --> 5630.6
it's flat right I mean the apparent Demi

5627.94 --> 5633.04
sphere of the celestial lights

5630.6 --> 5635.1990000000005
seems to be a sphere

5633.04 --> 5637.54
and you could think that it surrounds us

5635.199 --> 5640.239
even though it doesn't

5637.54 --> 5642.699
right but the Earth is flat and because

5640.239 --> 5645.04
of the combination of both

5642.699 --> 5647.62
because of the celestial Demi sphere

5645.04 --> 5650.679
because the Earth is flat the

5647.62 --> 5653.44
combination of that is what made the

5650.679 --> 5656.08
globe model work

5653.44 --> 5659.879999999999
if either one of those factors would be

5656.08 --> 5659.88
missing there would be no Globe model

5661.9 --> 5665.5
no planets are not spheres they're just

5664.6 --> 5668.56
lights

5665.5 --> 5670.96
they're intangible you can't you can't

5668.56 --> 5673.0
touch down that on that you can't even

5670.96 --> 5675.36
approach it and see the angular size

5673.0 --> 5675.36
increase

5675.639 --> 5681.04
sun is a star no the sun is an apparent

5679.3 --> 5684.179
light

5681.04 --> 5684.179
it's a hologram

5690.219 --> 5695.86
right and they're not actually

5692.02 --> 5698.9800000000005
surrounding you they just appear to be

5695.86 --> 5701.92
they're a holographic projection I don't

5698.98 --> 5704.199
know how how it manifests but I'm pretty

5701.92 --> 5707.5
damn sure it is

5704.199 --> 5712.919999999999
that just appears to the observer in a

5707.5 --> 5712.92
demi sphere at a set apparent distance

5714.52 --> 5719.080000000001
on the Flat Earth and that's what we get

5716.8 --> 5722.320000000001
to see every time every Celestial light

5719.08 --> 5724.78
under every condition the Sun including

5722.32 --> 5727.119
no matter how bright and heavy it is

5724.78 --> 5729.159
it's still a hologram

5727.119 --> 5731.199
even the Moon

5729.159 --> 5734.0199999999995
with all its weirdness and all its

5731.199 --> 5739.5599999999995
apparent Shadow and craters that you

5734.02 --> 5739.56
could think it has it's all a hologram

5739.84 --> 5744.34
right

5741.46 --> 5747.699
and it's not a hologram because the

5744.34 --> 5750.04
world is a hologram it's all just a

5747.699 --> 5751.36
matrix no it's because there's literally

5750.04 --> 5752.76
a light

5751.36 --> 5756.159
effect

5752.76 --> 5758.52
manifesting somehow inherently to the

5756.159 --> 5758.5199999999995
realm

5770.8 --> 5775.06
is the ball claimed not that the stars

5773.199 --> 5777.219
and sudden yeah there is assumption

5775.06 --> 5780.46
about that

5777.219 --> 5783.639
about yeah the stars and the Sun and all

5780.46 --> 5786.88
that being literal objects like Earth

5783.639 --> 5790.5
at an astronomical distance yeah that's

5786.88 --> 5790.5
how they attempt to make it work

5790.9 --> 5794.5599999999995
that's the more details about the

5792.76 --> 5795.46
mathematics that we can welcome to the

5794.56 --> 5799.7390000000005
Stream

5795.46 --> 5799.7390000000005
good to have you here and hello Nathan r

5812.32 --> 5817.78
what is the source of the neutrinos

5815.8 --> 5820.2390000000005
what are you talking about

5817.78 --> 5822.48
what did you measure that I don't think

5820.239 --> 5822.48
so

5823.239 --> 5829.0
there is no distinct position from which

5826.119 --> 5831.58
neutrinos Emin

5829.0 --> 5834.659
there's no distinct position from with

5831.58 --> 5837.94
the which the light emits yeah you might

5834.659 --> 5839.86
in the moment right in the moment like

5837.94 --> 5842.259999999999
oh I'm gonna do the song I'm Gonna

5839.86 --> 5843.5199999999995
detect something about that light that's

5842.26 --> 5846.46
arriving here

5843.52 --> 5849.6990000000005
and then you might derive like oh this

5846.46 --> 5852.1
means it is because of my reading it has

5849.699 --> 5856.119
to be exactly there in space

5852.1 --> 5859.0
or at like 300 or 3 000 miles away or

5856.119 --> 5861.839999999999
something right well then you'd you'd

5859.0 --> 5864.88
actually tried to go there and then

5861.84 --> 5868.06
there's nothing here there's literally

5864.88 --> 5871.3
nothing there the sun isn't there

5868.06 --> 5874.719
it's not there it now appears to be

5871.3 --> 5877.2390000000005
somewhere else yeah because it's not

5874.719 --> 5878.38
literally coming from anywhere it's a

5877.239 --> 5882.04
hologram

5878.38 --> 5884.92
the light manifests

5882.04 --> 5888.5199999999995
at an angular exact position in relation

5884.92 --> 5890.7390000000005
to the Observer within the time frame

5888.52 --> 5893.619000000001
that we live

5890.739 --> 5896.98
and light arrives it doesn't actually

5893.619 --> 5900.28
come from a specific thing in a specific

5896.98 --> 5903.4
position it just appears to the light

5900.28 --> 5906.699
just arrives it arrives

5903.4 --> 5909.78
in relation to that angular apparent

5906.699 --> 5909.78
manifestation point

5911.44 --> 5915.638999999999
but it's not actually coming from there

5913.54 --> 5918.1
not physically literally

5915.639 --> 5921.1
it's a holographic effect it's super

5918.1 --> 5924.280000000001
surreal and it's totally the entire

5921.1 --> 5926.38
realm all living things are immersed and

5924.28 --> 5928.9
dependent on it on this absolutely

5926.38 --> 5931.139
surreal thing that are the celestial

5928.9 --> 5931.138999999999
lights

5945.639 --> 5947.82
foreign

5960.179 --> 5964.84
I'm not expecting the trolls to be

5962.619 --> 5966.4
logical I'm mostly entertaining you guys

5964.84 --> 5969.6990000000005
I'm just like

5966.4 --> 5970.96
I'm showing off how much I've learned

5969.699 --> 5972.94
and hopefully

5970.96 --> 5975.1
you will be able to reflect on that

5972.94 --> 5977.699
because you've listened and considered

5975.1 --> 5977.6990000000005
it as well

5978.46 --> 5980.94
right

5985.42 --> 5990.639
I mean I really thought this through

5987.4 --> 5993.5199999999995
this is not just me being artistic here

5990.639 --> 5997.9800000000005
I really thought this through I have for

5993.52 --> 5997.9800000000005
a long time now a long long time

6000.119 --> 6006.659
have attempted to defend it against well

6003.6 --> 6010.08
with other flat earthers for quite a

6006.659 --> 6014.36
long time and have not backed down

6010.08 --> 6014.36
because I'm very certain of my case here

6021.36 --> 6028.199
I don't know how the celestials

6024.659 --> 6031.739
manifest the way they do why they yeah

6028.199 --> 6033.48
as in the cause of it but I do know what

6031.739 --> 6036.119
is going on

6033.48 --> 6040.159
and what the misassumptions are

6036.119 --> 6040.159
and how to figure that out

6041.28 --> 6048.0
I understand the nature of holographics

6044.219 --> 6051.0
I understand the nature of apparent

6048.0 --> 6051.0
non-locality

6053.219 --> 6058.8
I understand that concept not everybody

6056.4 --> 6061.08
does understand that concept it's very

6058.8 --> 6064.08
tough for most people

6061.08 --> 6067.5199999999995
but I understand it very well

6064.08 --> 6067.5199999999995
I have the talent for it

6068.4 --> 6072.08
spatial intelligence

6072.199 --> 6076.739
understanding

6073.86 --> 6079.5199999999995
geometry on an intuitive level really

6076.739 --> 6079.5199999999995
helps at it

6085.56 --> 6092.159000000001
well Indie France and uh

6088.92 --> 6095.04
I I found blocked everybody a long time

6092.159 --> 6097.92
ago that yeah I've unblocked everybody

6095.04 --> 6099.659
like since a few weeks now I don't think

6097.92 --> 6101.6990000000005
that your account is blocked unless you

6099.659 --> 6104.4
were trolling recently and I immediately

6101.699 --> 6107.46
banned you because I do know in France

6104.4 --> 6110.58
and you are very much a troll

6107.46 --> 6112.92
but I don't yeah you could just

6110.58 --> 6115.5599999999995
if everything's all right you should be

6112.92 --> 6118.4
able to just log get in on your original

6115.56 --> 6118.400000000001
account here

6134.76 --> 6140.1
you expect to be well

6137.46 --> 6143.1
I am going to ban you if you're not

6140.1 --> 6145.139
gonna say anything interesting if you're

6143.1 --> 6147.179
just gonna be there just to complain how

6145.139 --> 6149.400000000001
you are gonna be banned

6147.179 --> 6154.04
then I will eventually ban you but hey

6149.4 --> 6154.04
if you can actually add a conversation

6155.34 --> 6160.04
then

6156.84 --> 6160.04
yeah you can hang around

6161.219 --> 6164.699
right there's a very specific code of

6163.08 --> 6167.219
conduct here

6164.699 --> 6169.86
and when I unban everybody then

6167.219 --> 6172.139
everybody gets a new chance but if they

6169.86 --> 6174.299999999999
immediately screw up that chance then I

6172.139 --> 6177.679
will just ban you again

6174.3 --> 6177.679
that's how this works

6190.8 --> 6194.2390000000005
I think he just left

6200.52 --> 6205.92
you got banned pointing out

6204.719 --> 6209.4800000000005
what

6205.92 --> 6209.4800000000005
I don't know who you are

6227.58 --> 6232.199
change of name okay well

6233.52 --> 6236.119000000001
fine

6238.02 --> 6243.179
so yeah how's that

6240.48 --> 6245.04
that banning going that you counter down

6243.179 --> 6247.139
towards mister

6245.04 --> 6250.38
I'm so special

6247.139 --> 6253.56
I see you're still here

6250.38 --> 6255.179
so you got anything to add like actual

6253.56 --> 6257.280000000001
conversation about anything I was

6255.179 --> 6259.26
talking about

6257.28 --> 6262.32
it's mentioning the the holographic

6259.26 --> 6264.719
nature of the celestials

6262.32 --> 6267.48
how none of them are actually physical

6264.719 --> 6270.0
literal objects

6267.48 --> 6273.959999999999
in physical space

6270.0 --> 6277.8
that are a light source like a lamp or a

6273.96 --> 6280.52
candle that we make humans can make

6277.8 --> 6280.52
light

6280.92 --> 6284.639
how it's not like that

6282.9 --> 6286.259999999999
you have anything to add about that are

6284.639 --> 6288.659000000001
you just here to

6286.26 --> 6291.56
waste my time and complain about how you

6288.659 --> 6291.5599999999995
once were banned

6338.94 --> 6344.219
no no

6341.36 --> 6346.5599999999995
Michael Bean

6344.219 --> 6349.82
the real limitation

6346.56 --> 6352.7390000000005
that anybody can impose on themselves is

6349.82 --> 6356.159
believing in nonsense

6352.739 --> 6357.659
in things that are provably not true

6356.159 --> 6361.5599999999995
or

6357.659 --> 6365.759999999999
that you could never prove to be true

6361.56 --> 6368.04
because it's Out Of Reach forever

6365.76 --> 6370.860000000001
that's the real waste of time that's

6368.04 --> 6373.0199999999995
that's the real limitation

6370.86 --> 6375.42
it's a distraction

6373.02 --> 6377.52
that distracts you into doing something

6375.42 --> 6381.5
that will never yield anything

6377.52 --> 6381.5
productive because it's all an illusion

6384.48 --> 6389.159
and there's plenty that we can touch we

6386.82 --> 6391.98
can touch the Earth and we can

6389.159 --> 6394.44
look into the distance can touch things

6391.98 --> 6396.9
with our eyes and see

6394.44 --> 6399.48
that the Horizon is in the earth curve

6396.9 --> 6402.119
Black Swan

6399.48 --> 6403.379999999999
it's not very limiting that's actually

6402.119 --> 6405.96
very

6403.38 --> 6409.08
freeing

6405.96 --> 6411.84
right because the truth and what we can

6409.08 --> 6414.119
touch will help us and enable us to

6411.84 --> 6415.619000000001
dispel the things that are just a

6414.119 --> 6417.42
complete waste of time because they're

6415.619 --> 6420.9
not true

6417.42 --> 6423.84
like we want Ponder on the illusions

6420.9 --> 6426.36
about what's the next step that will be

6423.84 --> 6428.34
revealed because it's an illusion we

6426.36 --> 6430.32
might still learn the mechanics of the

6428.34 --> 6432.0
illusion like I have I love I understand

6430.32 --> 6435.299999999999
the global I don't understand how it's

6432.0 --> 6437.1
built I understand how the spell weaving

6435.3 --> 6439.679
works I understand how people's

6437.1 --> 6442.56
curiosity within heliocentrism can be

6439.679 --> 6445.26
grabbed I understand all of that

6442.56 --> 6447.42
but I am not like what's going to be

6445.26 --> 6449.52
next what's the next Discovery because I

6447.42 --> 6453.0
know it's an illusion I'm not actually

6449.52 --> 6455.9400000000005
going to be wasting my energy on hoping

6453.0 --> 6458.28
on something that's grounded in absolute

6455.94 --> 6460.94
illusion and that will never actually be

6458.28 --> 6460.94
anything physical

6461.52 --> 6465.7390000000005
yeah

6462.78 --> 6465.739
that's the difference

6473.4 --> 6479.4
I'm never going to be worried about the

6476.52 --> 6481.9800000000005
next meteor let's say oh it just flew

6479.4 --> 6484.739
just by the earth oh we avoided disaster

6481.98 --> 6485.82
again oh yeah because I know that's not

6484.739 --> 6489.799999999999
real

6485.82 --> 6489.799999999999
never was real never will be real

6492.3 --> 6498.719
I'm never gonna worry about how the

6494.639 --> 6501.179
moon's orbit is oh my God the Moon is is

6498.719 --> 6503.94
losing its orbit it might crash into

6501.179 --> 6506.52
Earth one day I know because it's not

6503.94 --> 6507.78
none of that could ever be real it's all

6506.52 --> 6510.06
nonsense

6507.78 --> 6511.679
see I'm not gonna waste my energy on

6510.06 --> 6514.619000000001
that nonsense

6511.679 --> 6516.42
I understand that it is a suggestion

6514.619 --> 6520.4
within the belief

6516.42 --> 6520.4
that people might dwell upon

6521.4 --> 6526.5599999999995
but I will personally never dwell upon

6524.04 --> 6530.42
it because I know it's an illusion

6526.56 --> 6530.42
but I understand how it works

6537.78 --> 6544.759999999999
do I have PayPal yes I do it's in the

6540.78 --> 6544.759999999999
the YouTube description box below

6546.179 --> 6550.219
Fe facer laser

6570.119 --> 6574.679
by the way how can Shadows be

6572.219 --> 6578.96
directional when the sun is omnipresent

6574.679 --> 6578.96
now but that's not how it works at all

6579.96 --> 6583.639
it's not omnipresent

6585.48 --> 6594.419999999999
it still has a like cyclical circular

6590.159 --> 6596.58
position on the apparent on the apparent

6594.42 --> 6598.32
celestial sphere it's not omnipresent

6596.58 --> 6599.82
the sun doesn't shine all day long

6598.32 --> 6603.86
everywhere

6599.82 --> 6603.86
it's a really ridiculous thing to say

6607.739 --> 6613.86
oh May a donation okay cool

6610.8 --> 6617.719
thank you Effie laser phaser

6613.86 --> 6617.719
I appreciate that I'll check it out

6620.099 --> 6624.2390000000005
yeah by the way I have to mention I

6622.08 --> 6627.54
mentioned it after I rounded out my show

6624.239 --> 6630.0599999999995
yesterday I'm really happy about well

6627.54 --> 6632.639
not taking vitamin D3 and not don't have

6630.06 --> 6636.06
anything against it

6632.639 --> 6638.76
but yeah that tip my healer gave me

6636.06 --> 6640.860000000001
about it really

6638.76 --> 6644.9400000000005
seems to be working

6640.86 --> 6647.82
am I not very emotionally stable

6644.94 --> 6650.759999999999
in the last few days I really feel the

6647.82 --> 6652.44
difference I really feel it and yes I

6650.76 --> 6654.360000000001
have still a couple of moments where I

6652.44 --> 6657.239
get a little pissed off

6654.36 --> 6658.679
but overall I seem to be having a lot

6657.239 --> 6661.678999999999
more room

6658.679 --> 6663.84
to socially maneuver with before I

6661.679 --> 6665.76
really get like

6663.84 --> 6667.8
right

6665.76 --> 6670.04
does anybody notice that in the last few

6667.8 --> 6670.04
days

6672.78 --> 6679.139
yeah George Sanford indeed E equals m c

6676.5 --> 6682.38
squared actually means Einstein married

6679.139 --> 6684.7390000000005
cousin twice that's exactly what that

6682.38 --> 6684.7390000000005
means

6689.88 --> 6696.36
my patrons are they yeah well I'm not

6693.719 --> 6698.76
don't have a lot of patreons I mostly

6696.36 --> 6701.839999999999
get by through PayPal I would I would

6698.76 --> 6701.84
like more patreons

6702.9 --> 6705.619
what are you doing

6708.96 --> 6712.4
I understand what are you doing

6717.0 --> 6724.219
we were having a convo

6719.639 --> 6724.219
am I a joke to you yeah yeah you are

6758.34 --> 6761.0
hmm

6787.5 --> 6792.42
yeah don't calm down if you're gonna

6789.9 --> 6795.54
count down I am gonna ban you I don't

6792.42 --> 6797.9400000000005
care stop spamming in my chat nobody's

6795.54 --> 6800.099
gonna ban you

6797.94 --> 6803.659
but if you're gonna spam in my chat I

6800.099 --> 6803.659000000001
will ban you literally

6804.78 --> 6809.58
I have plenty of ballers in my chat

6807.3 --> 6813.3
these days

6809.58 --> 6814.5
but I don't like spammers so just don't

6813.3 --> 6817.400000000001
spam

6814.5 --> 6817.4
they'll be all right

6831.119 --> 6833.719
hmm

6834.48 --> 6838.5
yeah I think that you you might have

6836.639 --> 6842.659000000001
called that one right flutter Sage I

6838.5 --> 6842.659
think that that guy is just a troll

6849.659 --> 6853.98
who is my favorite baller

6852.239 --> 6856.86
well my favorite baller of all times

6853.98 --> 6861.44
would will probably always be rumpus

6856.86 --> 6861.44
he literally makes me laugh hysterically

6867.36 --> 6873.0599999999995
literally can you stop whining about

6871.56 --> 6876.42
banning

6873.06 --> 6879.0
yeah nobody cares why don't you actually

6876.42 --> 6881.219
say something that has something to do

6879.0 --> 6882.84
with anything other than oh I'm gonna

6881.219 --> 6885.659
get banned I'm gonna give it nobody

6882.84 --> 6887.28
gives a [ __ ] literally nobody gives a

6885.659 --> 6888.0
[ __ ] whether you're gonna get banned or

6887.28 --> 6890.34
not

6888.0 --> 6894.739
have a conversation about something

6890.34 --> 6894.7390000000005
other than you are gonna get banned okay

6895.5 --> 6898.76
stop whining

6914.2 --> 6917.2789999999995
[Music]

6932.4 --> 6937.799999999999
yeah yeah Matthew those are pretty much

6935.04 --> 6941.28
the the standard social rules it's very

6937.8 --> 6943.38
basic also there is an exemption clause

6941.28 --> 6945.48
and that is when I'm like really extra

6943.38 --> 6946.7390000000005
agitated and pissed off I reserve the

6945.48 --> 6949.199
right to be

6946.739 --> 6952.199
unreasonably

6949.199 --> 6954.239
harsh at times

6952.199 --> 6957.0
because there's literally nothing you

6954.239 --> 6960.48
can do to stop that when I feel like

6957.0 --> 6963.179
that except just stay away

6960.48 --> 6965.638999999999
but I never act out like that for a very

6963.179 --> 6968.4
prolonged time

6965.639 --> 6971.159000000001
right but I still Reserve dictatorial

6968.4 --> 6974.04
rights to be a complete ass at times

6971.159 --> 6977.159
although I personally don't prioritize

6974.04 --> 6979.199
doing that because I like to be seen as

6977.159 --> 6981.0599999999995
somebody that is actually competent and

6979.199 --> 6984.178999999999
that is consistent

6981.06 --> 6987.2390000000005
but I do get like extra agitated at

6984.179 --> 6990.4400000000005
times and then I might be a little harsh

6987.239 --> 6990.44
I reserve the right

6990.96 --> 6996.4800000000005
that's by the way an exclusive right

6993.3 --> 6999.84
it's a right that nobody else on this

6996.48 --> 7001.94
live channel on this live show has nor

6999.84 --> 7004.719
could they ever expect to get that right

7001.94 --> 7004.719
ever

7010.34 --> 7016.88
and reasonably human natured

7014.06 --> 7019.219
right right since that's that I like

7016.88 --> 7021.58
that word unreasonably human natured I

7019.219 --> 7021.58
like that

7028.94 --> 7034.9
what are my thoughts on reincarnation I

7031.52 --> 7034.900000000001
don't know I'll see when it happens

7034.94 --> 7039.32
I mean

7036.38 --> 7041.36
as far as I'm concerned Jesus talked

7039.32 --> 7043.699
about it

7041.36 --> 7046.82
I think it's not unreasonable that our

7043.699 --> 7051.86
Spirits might migrate to other Thrones

7046.82 --> 7055.46
of Flesh before we are able to leave

7051.86 --> 7058.04
right but in my like if I'd have to like

7055.46 --> 7060.44
get really spiritually existential about

7058.04 --> 7062.119
it I think that reincarnation is the

7060.44 --> 7064.58
punishment

7062.119 --> 7067.759999999999
right this is hell

7064.58 --> 7069.679
yeah and then if you reincarnate yeah

7067.76 --> 7071.42
guess where you are you're in hell and

7069.679 --> 7074.599
you're gonna start over again you're

7071.42 --> 7076.88
gonna have to start out all innocent and

7074.599 --> 7078.619000000001
then learn how [ __ ] up this world is

7076.88 --> 7081.159000000001
once again

7078.619 --> 7081.159
right

7082.159 --> 7088.28
so yeah

7084.58 --> 7090.38
reincarnation seems only logical like

7088.28 --> 7092.179
you can't escape until your spirit

7090.38 --> 7095.0
actually is sentenced

7092.179 --> 7097.28
and then you escape you go to the Stars

7095.0 --> 7101.86
you move to the next level

7097.28 --> 7101.86
but it's really tough to escape hell

7105.92 --> 7111.92
and you could also definitely go deeper

7108.92 --> 7115.4
right because look at it like this

7111.92 --> 7118.159
if you're guaranteed to reincarnate

7115.4 --> 7120.799999999999
and you as an individual in your current

7118.159 --> 7123.92
life are like creating a terrible

7120.8 --> 7126.9800000000005
terrible [ __ ] out of the place right

7123.92 --> 7129.5
you're just ego maniacal and you just

7126.98 --> 7135.259999999999
make everything worse everybody hates

7129.5 --> 7137.599
you you poison things you ruin moods

7135.26 --> 7140.4400000000005
yeah guess what

7137.599 --> 7144.099
that's you

7140.44 --> 7146.9
poisoning the well that you will

7144.099 --> 7149.84
reincarnate in huh

7146.9 --> 7153.04
doesn't that seem just really fitting in

7149.84 --> 7153.04
a way ironically

7156.5 --> 7161.42
huh

7158.9 --> 7164.299999999999
so yeah maybe you will reincarnate over

7161.42 --> 7166.639
and over again or until you no longer

7164.3 --> 7169.52
can and then you might just be a dark

7166.639 --> 7172.88
dwelling spirit that can never escape

7169.52 --> 7175.820000000001
this realm but can never incarnate into

7172.88 --> 7177.26
a living person again at least not as an

7175.82 --> 7178.719
actual

7177.26 --> 7180.9800000000005
direct

7178.719 --> 7182.659
god-approved connection you won't

7180.98 --> 7184.58
actually get your own body anymore and

7182.659 --> 7186.619
then you'll be like the Fallen Angels

7184.58 --> 7188.84
you'll just be a dwelling extra

7186.619 --> 7192.0199999999995
dimensional spirit that tries to meddle

7188.84 --> 7194.0
with the earthlings right that would be

7192.02 --> 7196.6990000000005
the next level down

7194.0 --> 7199.94
that's the hell that's like the that's

7196.699 --> 7203.54
the abyss form you could say

7199.94 --> 7206.178999999999
so yeah it makes perfect sense

7203.54 --> 7208.94
this is

7206.179 --> 7210.8
the big bowl Earth

7208.94 --> 7213.08
this is the place

7210.8 --> 7215.900000000001
this is sort of like hell it's punishing

7213.08 --> 7218.78
and we're always being punished life is

7215.9 --> 7220.94
punishing but it also

7218.78 --> 7224.0
gives growth opportunity for the spirit

7220.94 --> 7226.04
and every time you try you might grow

7224.0 --> 7228.98
more attitude more attuned and then

7226.04 --> 7231.86
spiritually not literally reach where

7228.98 --> 7235.58
you can actually Ascend out of Earth

7231.86 --> 7238.219
Escape Earth go to heaven one might say

7235.58 --> 7240.739
go to the next level

7238.219 --> 7242.719
and if you fail then you have to try

7240.739 --> 7244.218999999999
over again and you will carry on that

7242.719 --> 7246.619
spirit that you've gathered in your

7244.219 --> 7248.78
previous life in your new life whether

7246.619 --> 7251.0
for good or for bad

7248.78 --> 7254.32
and then try again and then try again

7251.0 --> 7258.739
until you escape or until you disconnect

7254.32 --> 7261.08
Forever by having been so terrible that

7258.739 --> 7263.48
you literally get you become a stock

7261.08 --> 7266.179
dwelling spirit that can't reincarnate

7263.48 --> 7268.94
anymore and then you are among the

7266.179 --> 7272.06
Fallen ones and the extra dimensionals

7268.94 --> 7274.719
that are just trying to ruin things

7272.06 --> 7274.719
in hell

7274.94 --> 7277.36
right

7277.639 --> 7281.92
like the darkness likes company

7282.02 --> 7288.5
they don't want more souls to escape

7284.619 --> 7290.54
Escape their reach forever

7288.5 --> 7293.179
so that's kind of like

7290.54 --> 7295.78
the most intuitive direct approach that

7293.179 --> 7295.78
I can think of

7300.38 --> 7304.46
that's right flutter Sage that yeah that

7302.36 --> 7306.94
only seems the most logical it is the

7304.46 --> 7306.94
punishment

7307.099 --> 7311.119000000001
the reward is breaking away

7309.44 --> 7315.259999999999
so one could consider that the

7311.119 --> 7317.42
punishment is also the reward because

7315.26 --> 7320.360000000001
if you didn't get the punishment you

7317.42 --> 7322.58
wouldn't be able to get the reward and

7320.36 --> 7323.78
break away right so avoiding the

7322.58 --> 7326.84
punishment

7323.78 --> 7329.08
will actually guarantee that you will

7326.84 --> 7333.08
never break away isn't that just

7329.08 --> 7333.08
energetically perfect

7336.32 --> 7342.44
right you have to take the punishment

7339.56 --> 7344.360000000001
if the punishment is from God in a way

7342.44 --> 7345.619
it's the only thing that gives you the

7344.36 --> 7350.179
opportunity

7345.619 --> 7350.179
to ascend out eventually

7365.06 --> 7369.080000000001
breaking of the karmic cycle to be

7367.099 --> 7371.54
enlightened well there's all kinds of

7369.08 --> 7375.44
approaches right because who really

7371.54 --> 7379.159
knows right who really knows exactly how

7375.44 --> 7379.159
you eventually Escape

7381.44 --> 7388.4
but there are different philosophies on

7385.28 --> 7390.08
what the focus in the process

7388.4 --> 7393.619
serenity

7390.08 --> 7396.739
like self-sacrificial Deeds or just

7393.619 --> 7401.119
being super good to everybody or to

7396.739 --> 7404.36
destroy evil right those are all

7401.119 --> 7408.38
philosophies on how to

7404.36 --> 7411.219
help the spirit Ascend in some way

7408.38 --> 7411.219
and Escape

7412.04 --> 7417.44
but nobody knows for sure because yeah

7414.32 --> 7419.599
most people that that return if if

7417.44 --> 7421.699
you're gonna go by that model most that

7419.599 --> 7423.679
return yeah they start a fresh slate

7421.699 --> 7425.36
they have ancestral memories but they

7423.679 --> 7428.179
still are innocent

7425.36 --> 7431.679
they don't have a literal grip on all

7428.179 --> 7431.679
the knowledge that was passed on

7432.139 --> 7438.52
they will eventually if they meet the

7435.619 --> 7438.5199999999995
challenge once again

7440.239 --> 7444.919999999999
right so there's nobody that's gonna

7442.4 --> 7447.138999999999
just like

7444.92 --> 7449.119
tell everybody this is exactly how it

7447.139 --> 7451.099
worked that's and that's a mistake

7449.119 --> 7454.4
that's correct that's a mistake like

7451.099 --> 7456.32
because nobody knows I mean a child

7454.4 --> 7458.659
might know but who's going to then

7456.32 --> 7459.679
literally believe like that's absolutely

7458.659 --> 7461.719
real

7459.679 --> 7463.04
there's always going to be some kind of

7461.719 --> 7465.7390000000005
a

7463.04 --> 7468.86
rose-colored Darkly through which the

7465.739 --> 7471.138999999999
Consciousness in that body is going to

7468.86 --> 7474.5199999999995
translate all the information that was

7471.139 --> 7474.52
passed on at Birth

7481.82 --> 7486.5
oh my God could exist there should be

7484.52 --> 7490.84
good evidence yeah yeah the antecedent

7486.5 --> 7490.84
is God that can only be God

7491.179 --> 7497.2390000000005
there is no way physical reality could

7494.3 --> 7500.179
exist if there was not God

7497.239 --> 7502.759999999999
because things don't form out of

7500.179 --> 7504.26
themselves things don't come into being

7502.76 --> 7506.900000000001
through nothing

7504.26 --> 7510.139
it had to be designed it had to be

7506.9 --> 7513.638999999999
managed all the way God is the provider

7510.139 --> 7518.42
of all information all of it every

7513.639 --> 7520.82
single bit byte idea

7518.42 --> 7523.9400000000005
everything comes from God

7520.82 --> 7526.579
everything he is the manager of the

7523.94 --> 7531.5199999999995
akashic library he designed it

7526.579 --> 7531.5199999999995
he is the architect of all information

7532.579 --> 7536.78
physical reality as we know it in our

7534.92 --> 7540.26
experience and our Consciousness can

7536.78 --> 7542.179
only exist because there is a God that

7540.26 --> 7546.099
designed it all

7542.179 --> 7546.099
Before Time existed

7556.96 --> 7562.699
show some evidence

7559.34 --> 7568.42
everything is my evidence

7562.699 --> 7568.419999999999
everything can only exist because of God

7570.86 --> 7575.239
it got away with that

7572.96 --> 7578.86
I'm not gonna ban you literally I'm not

7575.239 --> 7578.86
gonna ban you you hear me scum

7579.679 --> 7586.579
unless you turn into a complete demonic

7583.4 --> 7589.098999999999
piece of [ __ ] again and then I will

7586.579 --> 7591.199
but it's not because I always ban you

7589.099 --> 7593.2390000000005
it's because you are acting like a

7591.199 --> 7595.28
demonic piece of [ __ ]

7593.239 --> 7598.218999999999
so I'm letting you get away by just

7595.28 --> 7600.739
quickly deleting that message

7598.219 --> 7603.38
right if you do that again I will ban

7600.739 --> 7607.159
you and it's completely yours it's a

7603.38 --> 7610.9400000000005
demon taking you into his possession

7607.159 --> 7613.839999999999
because you want to be banned

7610.94 --> 7613.839999999999
so don't do it

7635.119 --> 7641.598999999999
but this entire Matrix Physical Realm

7639.079 --> 7644.599
was designed by God

7641.599 --> 7647.599
and can only exist because he is there

7644.599 --> 7651.159000000001
to have designed it from scratch that's

7647.599 --> 7651.159000000001
the only reason it exists

7652.099 --> 7657.860000000001
everything is designed every part every

7654.8 --> 7659.54
part of life every part of matter all

7657.86 --> 7662.42
the patterns

7659.54 --> 7666.199
the patterns of crystallization only

7662.42 --> 7668.86
exist because it was designed to exist

7666.199 --> 7668.86
like that

7672.04 --> 7678.739
patterns don't just manifest out of

7675.5 --> 7681.8
nothing the patterns were always there

7678.739 --> 7684.799999999999
that's the akashic record it's the

7681.8 --> 7687.1990000000005
pattern of all things all information in

7684.8 --> 7690.4400000000005
every form it exists because it was

7687.199 --> 7692.54
introduced because it was designed by

7690.44 --> 7697.299999999999
God

7692.54 --> 7697.3
patterns only exist because of God

7712.88 --> 7717.9400000000005
that nobody is telling you that

7714.619 --> 7722.179
literally stop acting like such a [ __ ]

7717.94 --> 7725.239
seriously stop acting like a [ __ ] okay

7722.179 --> 7728.2390000000005
nobody's telling you that stop acting

7725.239 --> 7732.098999999999
like a [ __ ] literally I'm not gonna ban

7728.239 --> 7732.098999999999
you just stop acting like a [ __ ]

7778.699 --> 7784.719
who designed God no

7781.699 --> 7784.719
we don't know

7785.179 --> 7792.619
we can never know because God exists

7788.42 --> 7795.619
outside of our physical reality

7792.619 --> 7799.28
everything we know and are is through

7795.619 --> 7800.78
him he's the Capstone he is like the

7799.28 --> 7805.759999999999
ultimate

7800.78 --> 7808.219
boundary we don't know anything outside

7805.76 --> 7810.38
we don't know things outside of physical

7808.219 --> 7812.119
reality

7810.38 --> 7814.639
for real we need to just know the

7812.119 --> 7816.679
patterns through reflections of our

7814.639 --> 7819.5
physical reality as to what how

7816.679 --> 7822.139
spiritual things manifest we don't know

7819.5 --> 7825.28
anything outside of what God has

7822.139 --> 7825.28
designed us to be

7826.28 --> 7831.139
we the only things we can know are

7828.619 --> 7833.48
between the spectrum of all things

7831.139 --> 7837.219
between God

7833.48 --> 7837.218999999999
and physical substance

7837.26 --> 7843.52
right there might be things Beyond we

7839.78 --> 7843.5199999999995
don't know it's not relevant to us

7845.239 --> 7850.218999999999
we're just an extension of God I've

7848.599 --> 7852.219
always said

7850.219 --> 7855.94
our human consciousness are like

7852.219 --> 7859.94
fractured fragments of of God's

7855.94 --> 7861.98
experience existence himself

7859.94 --> 7865.28
and he created this

7861.98 --> 7867.94
to understand himself better through

7865.28 --> 7867.94
ignorance

7869.06 --> 7874.579000000001
but that's a philosophical statement so

7872.659 --> 7877.299999999999
but I've been saying that since I liked

7874.579 --> 7877.299999999999
in my teens

7879.56 --> 7884.860000000001
right so we are literally in God's mind

7885.8 --> 7891.1990000000005
we have he thought us up we are

7888.26 --> 7893.4800000000005
basically the effective imagination of

7891.199 --> 7895.879999999999
God manifesting

7893.48 --> 7899.98
right can things in our imagination

7895.88 --> 7904.34
exist outside of our imagination

7899.98 --> 7906.919999999999
well God or we in this case not saying

7904.34 --> 7908.179
that we are God but yeah we can create

7906.92 --> 7912.02
things

7908.179 --> 7914.0
from our imagination in our world well

7912.02 --> 7915.26
maybe God can too

7914.0 --> 7917.3
it's not relevant to us because

7915.26 --> 7919.76
everything that's in our imagination is

7917.3 --> 7922.46
only ever in our imagination

7919.76 --> 7926.3
and the only thing it can receive is

7922.46 --> 7929.599
what the god of that imagination through

7926.3 --> 7931.88
their experiences passes on to it the

7929.599 --> 7935.179
imagination simulation

7931.88 --> 7937.46
and that's how we receive information

7935.179 --> 7939.86
the only information we receive is

7937.46 --> 7942.619
through God

7939.86 --> 7946.579
that's how we get all our ideas

7942.619 --> 7949.639
so I don't know if God is interactive in

7946.579 --> 7951.619
his own kind of world I don't know I

7949.639 --> 7953.8
don't think we will ever find out for

7951.619 --> 7953.799999999999
real

7953.9 --> 7959.78
unless perhaps you ascend

7957.199 --> 7961.5199999999995
then maybe you will find out but you'll

7959.78 --> 7964.28
never be able to tell anybody in the

7961.52 --> 7967.9400000000005
realm because you're out of the realm

7964.28 --> 7970.94
and why the hell would you go back

7967.94 --> 7973.04
the only reason to even consider going

7970.94 --> 7976.839999999999
back is because there wouldn't be

7973.04 --> 7976.84
anything out there

7977.48 --> 7984.199
unless that's exactly what you wanted

7981.44 --> 7986.48
you don't want the the clogging cluster

7984.199 --> 7987.739
[ __ ] of things happening in this realm

7986.48 --> 7991.04
anymore

7987.739 --> 7992.839999999999
it's complicated it's all very very

7991.04 --> 7995.139
complicated when you really think about

7992.84 --> 7995.139
it

8002.44 --> 8005.44
anyway I'm going to take a two minute

8004.0 --> 8006.76
break and then probably gonna run out

8005.44 --> 8007.54
the show it's been a very good show

8006.76 --> 8010.38
though

8007.54 --> 8010.38
be right back

8029.139 --> 8032.099
never mind

8034.84 --> 8038.46
somebody else is on the toilet

8038.84 --> 8041.959
[Music]

8061.78 --> 8068.159
God botherers

8064.78 --> 8068.159
[ __ ] are you talking about

8072.699 --> 8078.419999999999
don't don't do that don't retract

8075.88 --> 8078.42
messages

8129.219 --> 8132.78
it's my chat stuck

8136.54 --> 8141.179
no no it's not

8138.76 --> 8141.179
all right

8173.56 --> 8177.96
wow trolls are very strong

8178.599 --> 8183.900000000001
they're strongly rolling in with their

8181.48 --> 8183.9
nonsense

8188.5 --> 8192.599
no no you're an idiot

8192.7 --> 8198.939
but maybe I don't know maybe you could

8195.639 --> 8200.92
actually talk about anything

8198.939 --> 8203.08
why don't you share some data with us

8200.92 --> 8205.78
literally

8203.08 --> 8208.66
all you've done since you've popped back

8205.78 --> 8210.16
into this chat is just complaining and

8208.66 --> 8212.979
complaining
