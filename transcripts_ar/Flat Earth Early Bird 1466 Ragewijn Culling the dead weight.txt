outside continually now

139.14 --> 143.819
but there's been a lot of fireworks

141.959 --> 148.22
but not surprising because it's like

143.819 --> 148.22
right next to the new year and

148.26 --> 153.54
like especially like the the two days

151.5 --> 157.58

153.54 --> 157.57999999999998
there's like fireworks continually

158.22 --> 163.98

it's cloudy it's windy it's a little bit

163.98 --> 170.23899999999998
rainy but not a lot

166.379 --> 170.239
enough to get droplets on the window

192.54 --> 195.07999999999998
all right

195.72 --> 202.85999999999999

204.2 --> 208.39999999999998

[Music]

223.14 --> 228.07999999999998
hey dank first in chat good to see you

225.84 --> 228.08
man

228.239 --> 233.06
good morning or afternoon for you I

230.879 --> 233.06
think

239.4 --> 242.36
hello

244.159 --> 248.12
Earth is flat hello

248.159 --> 254.72
7 A.M oh United States East Coast

259.739 --> 266.17999999999995
right okay okay

262.32 --> 266.18
good morning then indeed

269.4 --> 275.21999999999997
all right

271.5 --> 278.46
right so yeah yesterday

275.22 --> 280.62
it's a bit of a vacated day

278.46 --> 282.35999999999996
I did think I had a really good show

280.62 --> 284.34000000000003
though

282.36 --> 286.8
it was good enough that trolls even

284.34 --> 288.53999999999996
threatened me in the chat again or in

286.8 --> 292.699
the comment section

288.54 --> 292.699
doesn't amount to anything of course

292.759 --> 297.24
but uh yeah I thought that yesterday's

295.5 --> 300.36
show and the title

297.24 --> 302.58
wasn't very good and no flat Earth

300.36 --> 305.58000000000004
debates Premiere was very short was all

302.58 --> 309.74
kind of disappointing Nathan

305.58 --> 309.74
so yeah better have a live show today

313.34 --> 316.4
all right

323.22 --> 328.1
so let's see what's up

341.1 --> 346.199
I've already had just really short shows

343.56 --> 348.18
except maybe for Jimbo

346.199 --> 350.41900000000004
flat side of the premiere but it was

348.18 --> 350.419
short

353.28 --> 357.84
so yeah there's not a lot of activity on

355.8 --> 360.38
YouTube

357.84 --> 360.38
yesterday

360.479 --> 367.4
we ended up watching more episodes of

363.24 --> 367.40000000000003
Cabinet of Curiosities

367.56 --> 370.16
Netflix

371.4 --> 375.71999999999997
oh

372.84 --> 378.44
twenty dollars okay okay thanks I could

375.72 --> 378.44000000000005
certainly use that

382.6 --> 388.08000000000004
[Music]

384.78 --> 390.979
right thanks thanks dank

388.08 --> 390.979
but uh

391.62 --> 396.72
yeah I mean every time I have a really

394.259 --> 399.24
good episode with some good points I'm

396.72 --> 400.97900000000004
always I am really am I am always

399.24 --> 403.819
disappointed afterward when there's

400.979 --> 407.78
literally just no responses to it

403.819 --> 407.78000000000003
because I thought that

408.18 --> 413.22
my

410.88 --> 414.96
perception

413.22 --> 418.259
about

414.96 --> 420.84
the word Jew right and with all that

418.259 --> 423.539
that issue the issue surrounding it from

420.84 --> 425.88
the Google search I thought I made a

423.539 --> 427.199
really good point there that is worth

425.88 --> 429.6
considering

427.199 --> 432.539
and investigating

429.6 --> 435.18
I've had very yeah I've had no in

432.539 --> 439.09999999999997
content comment

435.18 --> 439.1
to that unfortunately

444.3 --> 451.74
also starting to notice that okay

447.68 --> 455.039
yes yes and Ed starts playing I click

451.74 --> 459.0
back go back to the page the ad [ __ ]

455.039 --> 462.199
still plays I mean what the hell YouTube

459.0 --> 462.199
[ __ ] is wrong with you

467.22 --> 469.34000000000003
okay

473.94 --> 478.62
all right but

477.12 --> 481.08
I'm just I'm kind of a little

478.62 --> 483.539
disappointed about the amount of views I

481.08 --> 485.039
still get and wonder sometimes if it's

483.539 --> 486.36
just being

485.039 --> 489.9
cut off

486.36 --> 493.28000000000003
because no YouTube that's not what I

489.9 --> 493.28
wanted to do uh

494.58 --> 500.4
I mean if I were to believe this there's

496.919 --> 505.81899999999996
just shows including good one ones that

500.4 --> 505.81899999999996
just like never get more than 201 views

507.319 --> 513.319
that seems highly illogical especially

510.66 --> 513.3190000000001
over time

514.68 --> 520.52
so it almost seems like it just kind of

517.26 --> 526.08
like stops counting my views

520.52 --> 526.0799999999999
after like two weeks or something almost

529.2 --> 533.9590000000001
yeah

531.06 --> 533.959
[ __ ] off

1737.36 --> 1743.539
you always click on random weirdo videos

1740.36 --> 1746.5
and then just assume it's all true are

1743.539 --> 1746.5
you out of your mind

1746.539 --> 1752.539
do you know the garbage that is made up

1749.72 --> 1756.26
there as supposed flat earthers just

1752.539 --> 1759.32
start making random garbage up and then

1756.26 --> 1762.08
trying to portray it like it's real

1759.32 --> 1763.279
do you even know that that's happening

1762.08 --> 1766.46
out there

1763.279 --> 1769.1
why do you why do you think

1766.46 --> 1771.559
I would even say something like if

1769.1 --> 1773.6
Andrew Tate is considered or accepted in

1771.559 --> 1776.1789999999999
a flat Earth Community I'm [ __ ] out

1773.6 --> 1780.02
because it's garbage

1776.179 --> 1783.38
there is so much garbage Flat Earth is

1780.02 --> 1786.32
being turned into garbage through the

1783.38 --> 1789.6200000000001
people that are turning it into garbage

1786.32 --> 1792.32
you see and the more you accept because

1789.62 --> 1794.9599999999998
you're a [ __ ] little [ __ ] that

1792.32 --> 1796.7
wants their numbers we want the majority

1794.96 --> 1799.52
yeah guess what you're gonna get all the

1796.7 --> 1802.3990000000001
[ __ ] the range retards you could ever

1799.52 --> 1804.62
imagine until you don't even know the

1802.399 --> 1806.6
[ __ ] nature

1804.62 --> 1809.059
of the ground you're standing on anymore

1806.6 --> 1812.299
until you know nothing you're just known

1809.059 --> 1815.36
deranged idiotic Tales because that's

1812.299 --> 1818.6589999999999
what they're telling you now on purpose

1815.36 --> 1821.539
oh look at my completely different made

1818.659 --> 1824.0
up nonsensical [ __ ] that I'm gonna tell

1821.539 --> 1827.059
you is reality

1824.0 --> 1829.94
has no leads or clues that it even is

1827.059 --> 1832.279
remotely real in any way

1829.94 --> 1835.22
yeah

1832.279 --> 1837.32
not even prefacing it as in like oh this

1835.22 --> 1839.96
is an idea I had

1837.32 --> 1841.82
maybe it would be like this no they

1839.96 --> 1844.179
don't do it they just oh look it's this

1841.82 --> 1847.279
oh ancient oil was like this and this

1844.179 --> 1850.3990000000001
[ __ ] shut your [ __ ] mouth you

1847.279 --> 1852.86
disgusting deranged liar

1850.399 --> 1855.799
stop making random [ __ ] up and

1852.86 --> 1857.539
pretending it's absolutely real the [ __ ]

1855.799 --> 1861.1399999999999
is wrong with you

1857.539 --> 1863.48
yeah that's not what I do

1861.14 --> 1866.2990000000002
I'm a theorist

1863.48 --> 1869.179
so I reason out

1866.299 --> 1872.48
what I view to be potential

1869.179 --> 1875.659
possibilities of what could be real

1872.48 --> 1879.2
and then I lay that out as like this

1875.659 --> 1880.5800000000002
might be possible what would it be like

1879.2 --> 1883.88
right

1880.58 --> 1888.399
that's very different very different

1883.88 --> 1891.74
from some idiot just making [ __ ] up into

1888.399 --> 1894.62
religion I mean can you be [ __ ] more

1891.74 --> 1897.679
non-specific I mean really dude

1894.62 --> 1900.559
and then six on six portals what the

1897.679 --> 1903.44
[ __ ] portals what the [ __ ] are you

1900.559 --> 1905.72
talking about portals man what the hell

1903.44 --> 1908.48
is wrong with you

1905.72 --> 1911.72
six moons what the [ __ ]

1908.48 --> 1913.7
why did you just put that [ __ ] in my

1911.72 --> 1915.5
chat like it means something George

1913.7 --> 1917.96
Sanford

1915.5 --> 1921.399
I want an answer

1917.96 --> 1921.3990000000001
are you demented

1921.799 --> 1929.26
why don't you feel shame for putting a

1925.1 --> 1929.26
piece of garbage in my chat like that

1931.34 --> 1938.74
the Greek philosophers

1934.1 --> 1938.74
what they discussed philosophy

1938.84 --> 1945.5
they were not discussing six Sons six

1942.799 --> 1946.82
portals and six moons okay seeking star

1945.5 --> 1948.62
water

1946.82 --> 1951.1
there's no way

1948.62 --> 1951.1
ever

1951.64 --> 1960.039
well Testament describes portals

1956.96 --> 1960.039
what the [ __ ]

1960.62 --> 1966.1399999999999
I don't think so I think you're talking

1962.779 --> 1966.14
about uh

1968.179 --> 1970.96
the other book

1975.08 --> 1979.399
not the Bible George Sanford I don't

1978.14 --> 1981.0800000000002
know what the hell you're talking you're

1979.399 --> 1983.299
probably talking about the other book

1981.08 --> 1986.24
God damn it I forgot the name of it the

1983.299 --> 1989.62
Book of Enoch that's it right

1986.24 --> 1994.82
yeah it it talks about portals you know

1989.62 --> 1997.9399999999998
how it talks about portals

1994.82 --> 2001.299
yeah I know how because I picked up on

1997.94 --> 2004.1200000000001
that six years ago you know how they

2001.299 --> 2007.08
talk about it they talk about it in

2004.12 --> 2011.6789999999999
relation to their

2007.08 --> 2015.8799999999999
misunderstanding and Mis description of

2011.679 --> 2017.98
what the sun is yeah yeah it goes there

2015.88 --> 2020.38
and it goes in a portal

2017.98 --> 2022.72
yeah that's because they still thought

2020.38 --> 2024.22
it was a physical object and that's how

2022.72 --> 2025.6000000000001
they described it and then oh yeah

2024.22 --> 2027.7
you're gonna need portals because it

2025.6 --> 2030.2199999999998
makes no [ __ ] sense yeah yeah yeah I

2027.7 --> 2033.88
know I know because it isn't an object

2030.22 --> 2038.38
it's a hologram it doesn't have a portal

2033.88 --> 2040.8990000000001
the entire realm is its portal

2038.38 --> 2043.659
because it's not actually an object in

2040.899 --> 2046.12
any actual location

2043.659 --> 2048.7000000000003
that's why there's portals in The Book

2046.12 --> 2053.859
of Enoch yeah

2048.7 --> 2058.5
has nothing to do with the foundation of

2053.859 --> 2058.5
the realm or celestials at all

2060.72 --> 2067.48
celestials are not physical objects they

2064.899 --> 2070.379
never were they never will be they're

2067.48 --> 2070.379
Holograms

2070.48 --> 2075.3
they're images of light and that's it

2075.52 --> 2079.96
they have no location and there is no

2078.58 --> 2083.44
portals

2079.96 --> 2086.56
there might be a looping nature within

2083.44 --> 2090.419
the available space of the realm

2086.56 --> 2090.419
that's not described in the Bible

2101.5 --> 2106.809
right enough

2103.69 --> 2106.809
[Music]

2107.02 --> 2113.38
sorry guys I'm a little upset freaking

2109.66 --> 2116.859
camera and it's stupid fireworks

2113.38 --> 2117.94
and people blabbering nonsensically in

2116.859 --> 2119.2599999999998
my chat

2117.94 --> 2121.18
I hate it

2119.26 --> 2122.98
especially if there are people that

2121.18 --> 2126.8999999999996
actually have been following me for a

2122.98 --> 2126.9
while because that's very disappointing

2127.06 --> 2134.099
expect a higher level of coherence than

2130.9 --> 2134.099
what you're doing in my chat

2134.92 --> 2137.28
right

2139.839 --> 2145.599
right and if you actually appreciate

2143.8 --> 2148.2400000000002
that

2145.599 --> 2150.2200000000003
that they don't just let you hang around

2148.24 --> 2152.5
being an idiot

2150.22 --> 2155.2
then please donate to my PayPal because

2152.5 --> 2158.2
I can really use it

2155.2 --> 2160.5989999999997
I'm also a bit agitated and stressed out

2158.2 --> 2162.7599999999998
because my finances are not doing great

2160.599 --> 2166.26
right now

2162.76 --> 2166.26
been very slim

2167.56 --> 2172.42
even though I've had some support

2169.8 --> 2175.42
overall it's been kind of slim in like

2172.42 --> 2179.38
the last week or two

2175.42 --> 2182.6800000000003
and it's really adding up now or Subs

2179.38 --> 2184.1400000000003
subtracting to be more precise so please

2182.68 --> 2187.35
help me out

2184.14 --> 2187.35
[Music]

2188.92 --> 2192.94
I mean I was literally bragging at

2191.26 --> 2195.82
Christmas how well my financial

2192.94 --> 2197.44
situation is doing I probably shouldn't

2195.82 --> 2199.48
have done that because this typically

2197.44 --> 2202.06
happens then

2199.48 --> 2203.7400000000002
of course oh it's going great oh that

2202.06 --> 2204.94
means that everybody suddenly just

2203.74 --> 2208.1189999999997
doesn't

2204.94 --> 2211.06
roll up anymore it doesn't

2208.119 --> 2214.48
it it happens

2211.06 --> 2217.2999999999997
except for dank here it was quite quick

2214.48 --> 2220.98
right what I definitely need financial

2217.3 --> 2220.98
support I needed more

2226.24 --> 2230.2799999999997
because I do

2230.82 --> 2236.44
yeah otherwise I'm I'm gonna run out of

2233.68 --> 2239.0989999999997
smokes out of food out of everything

2236.44 --> 2239.099
quickly

2241.24 --> 2245.2599999999998
I'd like to remind you I've been doing

2242.92 --> 2248.14
shows even during Christmas Even though

2245.26 --> 2250.0
I was pretty much the only one that did

2248.14 --> 2253.96
a live stream during Christmas of

2250.0 --> 2256.359
everybody that I'm subscribed to

2253.96 --> 2259.2400000000002
except maybe for Paul Cook I think he

2256.359 --> 2262.02
did actually do a live stream

2259.24 --> 2262.02
on Christmas

2275.8 --> 2279.7000000000003
all right by the way seeking star water

2277.72 --> 2282.4599999999996
like could you be more specific the

2279.7 --> 2285.4199999999996
Greek philosophers discuss this at

2282.46 --> 2289.42
length yeah so

I'm a flat earther so I'm going to keep

looking at Nasa and when they roll out

their thing like some kind of reversed

Fanboy I'm just gonna complain and whine

that [ __ ]

I don't

2466.06 --> 2472.42
does that mean I'm not a flat earther

2573.82 --> 2578.6800000000003

2576.04 --> 2581.819
that that was weird it's just that it's

2578.68 --> 2581.819
rainy and all that

2586.9 --> 2591.88
it's probably the combination with the

2589.72 --> 2593.74
financial situation too I mean if I'd be

2591.88 --> 2595.359
financially fine then I'd have no

2593.74 --> 2597.7599999999998
problem with it I might be a little bit

2595.359 --> 2599.44
more tired than usual

moving up there it's almost like a

just a heavy traffic stop stop somewhere

video that has infrared if you want to

2976.66 --> 2980.16
have a quick feel of that

this very typical video that does pop up

2982.48 --> 2986.2
I don't know

2983.98 --> 2989.7
but I haven't listened to it I'm just

2986.2 --> 2989.7
watching the imagery of it

3011.0 --> 3017.74
okay yeah though that's weird hey hello

3014.16 --> 3030.269
by the way Eric 1111

3017.74 --> 3030.269
[Music]

3033.66 --> 3039.54
right so they'll use the West appear to

3036.24 --> 3042.0
large one yeah okay Cleary but that's I

3039.54 --> 3043.8
don't think that that is Celestial in

3042.0 --> 3045.839
nature because

3043.8 --> 3047.76
that happens to all the Celestia that

3045.839 --> 3049.38
happens to the sun too

3047.76 --> 3053.0400000000004
right

3049.38 --> 3056.579
when celestials get angular wise at the

3053.04 --> 3059.2799999999997
Horizon they become magnified because

3056.579 --> 3062.819
well the lensing effect

3059.28 --> 3066.0
is what I think is even claimed

3062.819 --> 3067.5
but that is obviously the reason there's

3066.0 --> 3069.72
a lens effect

3067.5 --> 3071.7
through all the air that you're looking

3069.72 --> 3074.2799999999997
through which is much thicker when you

3071.7 --> 3076.319
look over the black plane compared to

3074.28 --> 3078.059
looking straight up when you're

3076.319 --> 3080.88
basically looking at a lot of thin air

3078.059 --> 3084.7200000000003
up above you so it's not surprising that

3080.88 --> 3087.599
the angular size even of stars would

3084.72 --> 3090.0
appear to increase at the horizon

3087.599 --> 3092.1600000000003
compared to straight overhead

3090.0 --> 3094.02
totally makes sense

3092.16 --> 3094.99
same thing happens through the Sun and

3094.02 --> 3100.119
the Moon

3094.99 --> 3100.1189999999997
[Music]

3106.079 --> 3111.1800000000003
right

3107.4 --> 3113.64
so yeah and look the whole thing would

3111.18 --> 3117.359
then be magnified

3113.64 --> 3120.1189999999997
which would include this scaling between

3117.359 --> 3122.42
it so yeah if it seems bigger then it'll

3120.119 --> 3125.88
probably not just be

3122.42 --> 3129.66
more a bigger spot at the same distance

3125.88 --> 3132.01
it's going to be magnified as a whole

3129.66 --> 3135.219
it's only logical

3132.01 --> 3135.219
[Music]

3137.94 --> 3143.4
angular size yeah but the angular size

3140.099 --> 3145.98
of the Stars if the if the scale between

3143.4 --> 3147.9
the distance changes then the angular

3145.98 --> 3150.48
size even though you might not even be

3147.9 --> 3152.88
able to measure that properly is going

3150.48 --> 3156.2400000000002
to change similarly

3152.88 --> 3158.7000000000003
that's what a lensing does it magnifies

3156.24 --> 3162.02
everything including the apparent

3158.7 --> 3162.02
distances between points

3166.79 --> 3174.479
[Music]

3181.339 --> 3185.339
convert compression

3187.38 --> 3192.2400000000002
not magnification no there is absolutely

3190.319 --> 3193.859
magnification I don't know what the hell

3192.24 --> 3196.5789999999997
you're talking about

3193.859 --> 3200.4
the sun becomes bigger

3196.579 --> 3203.2200000000003
yeah it also compacts

3200.4 --> 3205.4300000000003
but it it literally becomes bigger it's

3203.22 --> 3208.66
bigger you see it bigger

3205.43 --> 3208.66
[Music]

3212.04 --> 3216.9
[Music]

3214.26 --> 3220.1600000000003
or did I measure it

3216.9 --> 3220.1600000000003
I looked at it

3229.04 --> 3233.339
the moon I'm not talking about the moon

3232.079 --> 3235.88
though

3233.339 --> 3239.5789999999997
but that might play a role of course

3235.88 --> 3242.52
celestials do tend to get like magnified

3239.579 --> 3244.1400000000003
in our heads but that's Universal that's

3242.52 --> 3246.68
no different than when they're straight

3244.14 --> 3246.68
above you

3248.28 --> 3254.52
but the angular apparent size of the sun

3251.94 --> 3257.339
does increase as it approaches The

3254.52 --> 3259.88
Horizon it just does it does become a

3257.339 --> 3259.88
little bigger

3265.14 --> 3268.8799999999997
pretty much everything does that

3267.059 --> 3272.2400000000002
approaches The Horizon

3268.88 --> 3272.2400000000002
Celestial wise

3273.62 --> 3285.38
[Music]

3292.859 --> 3300.0589999999997
just an optical illusion or isn't that

3297.359 --> 3302.819
the whole point

3300.059 --> 3305.46
I mean a magnification

3302.819 --> 3308.0589999999997
isn't a magnification an optical

3305.46 --> 3308.059
illusion

3320.96 --> 3324.619
isn't it all Optical

3331.98 --> 3334.98
uh-huh

3340.079 --> 3346.559
okay okay makapaka so what the [ __ ] is

3343.2 --> 3350.04
your point in relation to why this was

3346.559 --> 3352.8590000000004
brought on the table I think by Clary

3350.04 --> 3356.2799999999997
these other guys what the hell is your

3352.859 --> 3357.5989999999997
point so are you disputing what Clary

3356.28 --> 3359.94
says

3357.599 --> 3362.099
that the stars and the distance between

3359.94 --> 3364.7400000000002
them at the Horizon doesn't actually

3362.099 --> 3368.2200000000003
become bigger is that what you're saying

3364.74 --> 3370.6189999999997
markapaka isn't it so what's clearly

3368.22 --> 3373.9399999999996
wrong is that your statement

3370.619 --> 3373.94
is that what you're saying

3374.46 --> 3379.68
yeah I know you don't have to tell me

3377.16 --> 3382.04
that which I literally just explained

3379.68 --> 3382.04
myself

3382.74 --> 3387.2
so are you saying Clary is wrong

3390.24 --> 3394.9799999999996
it's clearly wrong I don't care about

3392.52 --> 3396.059
your statement is clearly wrong or isn't

3394.98 --> 3399.599
he

3396.059 --> 3400.38
yeah you chose to just dive in here do

3399.599 --> 3402.6600000000003
this

3400.38 --> 3405.0
theory is wrong well then just [ __ ]

3402.66 --> 3408.2599999999998
say that you ass

3405.0 --> 3410.94
don't blabber my chat full

3408.26 --> 3413.1800000000003
with all that [ __ ] just say he's wrong

3410.94 --> 3413.18
then

3416.28 --> 3421.38
right so there is no angular size

3418.98 --> 3423.48
increase at the Horizon it just seems

3421.38 --> 3426.2000000000003
like it okay Clary

3423.48 --> 3426.2
you get it

3430.619 --> 3437.2200000000003
dude no it's not obvious it's not

3433.859 --> 3440.359
obvious at all it doesn't even use

3437.22 --> 3444.4199999999996
the same Focus

3440.359 --> 3447.2999999999997
no no I I get it

3444.42 --> 3450.119
I know what that is I know that the Mind

3447.3 --> 3452.819
amplifies the apparent size to the

then this is not your show then

4834.86 --> 4841.4
maybe we could just go watch geronism or

something he never gets pissed off it

4857.78 --> 4861.259999999999
you go do that

happens over here there's interaction

4864.08 --> 4866.8
with the chat

4867.8 --> 4872.06
and I actually do care what people say

4870.8 --> 4874.88
in chat

4872.06 --> 4877.900000000001

the [ __ ] you think is wrong with him

4934.64 --> 4938.9800000000005
he's a lying scam artist

4942.02 --> 4947.9800000000005
he's a proven liar

4944.719 --> 4947.9800000000005
and a slanderer

4949.159 --> 4957.739
deals in very dubious things

4952.82 --> 4961.9
one of which being a crypto Pusher yeah

4957.739 --> 4961.9
Pusher not dealer pusher

4964.46 --> 4973.659

4970.219 --> 4973.659
like so many out there

4973.699 --> 4977.259999999999
so that's what's wrong with him

lots of flirts are scammers yeah lots of

4987.739 --> 4993.86

5007.54 --> 5010.96
you don't learn anything in that show

5009.4 --> 5014.44

5010.96 --> 5017.679
just a bunch of blabbering nonsense

5014.44 --> 5020.44
we're patting each other on the back not

5017.679 --> 5021.88
for anything good but just because they

5021.88 --> 5025.84

5023.679 --> 5028.4800000000005
I haven't watched it in years though

5025.84 --> 5030.28

5028.48 --> 5032.5599999999995
it made me almost want to throw up

5030.28 --> 5035.08

5032.56 --> 5036.34
just their voices these people are

5035.08 --> 5039.5199999999995
disgusting

5036.34 --> 5042.900000000001
they ooze just

5039.52 --> 5042.900000000001
it's hard to explain

5097.78 --> 5102.099999999999
do you still believe people have

implants and that magnets have something

5102.1 --> 5106.2390000000005
to do with that

5103.54 --> 5108.64
because that is deranged

5106.239 --> 5110.44
yeah I mean is that a good question to

5108.64 --> 5113.6990000000005
ask somebody

5110.44 --> 5113.699
and they they get back

something in the air

5285.88 --> 5290.46
I feel particularly agitated

5292.9 --> 5298.9
and yeah when nobody shows up or

5296.26 --> 5301.12
they then just subtly Pike up to

5298.9 --> 5303.5199999999995
complain about [ __ ] I mean yeah that

5301.12 --> 5305.98

5361.86 --> 5366.759999999999
also by the way weird [ __ ] all their

5365.26 --> 5368.56
stuff not related to anything I've

5366.76 --> 5370.659000000001
talked about might have been like

5368.56 --> 5375.580000000001
catching up on Bo and Benjamin and it's

5370.659 --> 5378.179
like so freaking weird man

5375.58 --> 5378.179
how

5380.86 --> 5386.44
how we like

5383.1 --> 5390.400000000001
synchronize with [ __ ] like he comes up

5386.44 --> 5392.32
with ideas the same time as I do I feel

5390.4 --> 5393.4
a lot of the times and we express it

5392.32 --> 5395.62
differently

5393.4 --> 5398.32
it's just like oh yeah

5395.62 --> 5401.739
like oh I'm gonna watch uh

5398.32 --> 5403.179
show from yesterday

5401.739 --> 5405.638999999999
and then I'm watching it and I'm like

5403.179 --> 5408.179
wait but that's sort of what I was

5405.639 --> 5408.179
talking about

5410.38 --> 5414.1
like

5411.76 --> 5416.56
yeah it's minor way it's hard to compare

5414.1 --> 5418.659000000001
I mean Owen Benjamin's live streams are

5416.56 --> 5420.159000000001
much more fluid and entertaining and

5418.659 --> 5422.44
well prepared

5420.159 --> 5423.759999999999
don't ask me how the hell he even does

5422.44 --> 5426.099999999999
that he probably has a team that

5423.76 --> 5427.780000000001
collects good stuff for him

5426.1 --> 5429.159000000001
through forum

5427.78 --> 5431.08
I don't

5429.159 --> 5434.638999999999
not really

5431.08 --> 5434.639
sometimes works in the summer

5435.82 --> 5439.9
hey Kevlar what

5446.5 --> 5450.58
the hell

5448.36 --> 5453.159
okay

5450.58 --> 5455.94
you know I'm super distracted

5453.159 --> 5455.94
uh

5457.239 --> 5462.879999999999
how was I talking about

5460.36 --> 5465.96
oh yeah synchronicities

5462.88 --> 5465.96
it's just like

5472.96 --> 5477.94
always mine yeah what makes me feel like

5475.48 --> 5480.159
that it just makes me feel like wow oh

5477.94 --> 5481.96
enemy we really just come up with the

5480.159 --> 5483.9
same ideas but we're very different

5481.96 --> 5486.52
people

5483.9 --> 5489.94
but it's really like we literally come

5486.52 --> 5493.860000000001
up with it like at the same time

5489.94 --> 5493.86
like separately of each other

5496.26 --> 5502.719
some things right not not everything

5500.02 --> 5505.0
some things we're just like you out we

5502.719 --> 5506.86
came up with that right the day that I

5505.0 --> 5509.38
came up with that I'm pretty damn sure

5506.86 --> 5512.199
he didn't see me like he wouldn't even

5509.38 --> 5515.1990000000005
have the time to try to

5512.199 --> 5517.78
steal an idea like that he would never

5515.199 --> 5519.879999999999
yeah it would probably much rather avoid

5517.78 --> 5524.58
it

5519.88 --> 5524.58
but he doesn't watch my show I mean dude

5524.86 --> 5529.54
somebody told me that Owen Benjamin

5527.199 --> 5531.4
would actually watch my show I would

5529.54 --> 5533.94
laugh in their faces there's no way he

5531.4 --> 5533.94
would do that

5541.78 --> 5547.0599999999995
oh and Benjamin sees everything well he

5544.179 --> 5549.34
does have bears that do report out for

5547.06 --> 5552.04
him and there are bears that follow my

5549.34 --> 5555.52
channel that I'm kind of expecting that

5552.04 --> 5559.179
they're gonna report about me

5555.52 --> 5560.9800000000005
to the bear Community I kind of hope so

5559.179 --> 5563.62
hope they're not always just keeping me

5560.98 --> 5565.9
a secret or something because that would

5563.62 --> 5570.12
be very disappointing

5565.9 --> 5570.12
my ideas are meant for spreading

5574.139 --> 5578.7390000000005
clovers aren't tapped into that flow but

5576.699 --> 5580.839999999999
they have their own flow though but that

5578.739 --> 5583.86
flow is much

5580.84 --> 5583.860000000001
less potent

5584.56 --> 5588.85
rests more on just

5586.679 --> 5592.039
mathematical Wizardry and all that

5588.85 --> 5592.039000000001
[Music]

5595.9 --> 5600.879999999999
but yeah it's the flow of inspiration

5599.139 --> 5603.58
and

5600.88 --> 5606.9400000000005
I don't know with some people

5603.58 --> 5608.92
it just works the same way and so the

5606.94 --> 5611.98
things come rolling out and it is like

5608.92 --> 5613.9
it's the same stream like why do two

5611.98 --> 5616.239
different people get the same ideas

5613.9 --> 5619.0599999999995
around the same time

5616.239 --> 5621.638999999999
completely separate of each other

5619.06 --> 5623.4400000000005
and that's just something that I'm like

5621.639 --> 5625.92
sort of starting to notice with Owen

5623.44 --> 5625.919999999999
Benjamin

5635.139 --> 5639.400000000001
let it flow let it go yeah well that's

5637.54 --> 5642.82
very important right because you can't

5639.4 --> 5646.339999999999
let it flow if you don't let it go

5690.219 --> 5692.82
oh

5693.219 --> 5696.78
what did YouTube do

5696.94 --> 5702.219
not delete the message of a troll when I

5699.82 --> 5706.299999999999
ban them

5702.219 --> 5709.42
I literally then have to unban them and

5706.3 --> 5712.900000000001
re-band them to remove their message

5709.42 --> 5716.8
and this only happens ever in the chat

5712.9 --> 5721.259999999999
with the worst worst of troll comments

5716.8 --> 5721.26
only with those does that happen

5722.38 --> 5728.139
I click hide user

5725.739 --> 5730.08
and then it's like oh he's hidden but

5728.139 --> 5733.78
then the message

5730.08 --> 5735.219
reappears visible to everybody it's not

5733.78 --> 5737.739
deleted

5735.219 --> 5738.82
and it only happens with the worst of

5737.739 --> 5742.599999999999
trolls

5738.82 --> 5746.699
for some inexplicable reason

6130.199 --> 6133.099999999999
very weird

6135.239 --> 6140.419999999999

6150.96 --> 6154.699

6156.119 --> 6159.739
can anybody confirm that

6159.78 --> 6165.5599999999995

6162.54 --> 6165.56
random [ __ ] up

6174.86 --> 6179.48
anybody anybody out there

6184.98 --> 6191.239
all right so yeah I'm gonna take that as

6187.139 --> 6191.2390000000005
a lie and just remove that

6191.94 --> 6197.239
you

6194.04 --> 6197.239
can [ __ ] off

6198.719 --> 6204.78
random [ __ ] I knew it

6202.02 --> 6208.580000000001
I hate it [ __ ] you

6204.78 --> 6208.58
I mean really [ __ ] you

6209.1 --> 6214.7390000000005
yeah making random [ __ ] up that's

6212.28 --> 6217.58
literally disinformation you're creating

6214.739 --> 6217.58
disinformation

6218.52 --> 6225.320000000001
I think so papa is dying

6222.0 --> 6225.32
like who are you

6229.08 --> 6234.8
do you even know who Bob is what's his

6232.139 --> 6234.8
last name

6236.219 --> 6239.219
foreign

6249.119 --> 6253.58
he's dying

6250.98 --> 6253.58
yes

6264.98 --> 6268.759999999999
where are you getting that from

6274.8 --> 6277.1
foreign

6277.98 --> 6285.718999999999
I mean I'm not surprised or anything man

6281.82 --> 6288.239
like that yeah they they at they gain

6285.719 --> 6292.02
certain things

6288.239 --> 6294.54
that typically happens yeah

6292.02 --> 6297.080000000001
when you immerse yourself in a certain

6294.54 --> 6297.08
sin

6303.42 --> 6308.52
but this is the first that I'm hearing

6305.58 --> 6311.1
of that so is this just another random

6308.52 --> 6312.3
rumor [ __ ] that I'm gonna have to

6311.1 --> 6315.360000000001
kick out

6312.3 --> 6318.860000000001
or somebody actually coming with real

6315.36 --> 6318.86
information for a change

6332.96 --> 6337.52
you know people who what

6340.08 --> 6344.119
yeah it's a troll lying I thought so

6347.88 --> 6350.719
foreign

6363.6 --> 6366.6
Tire

6369.06 --> 6373.679
I can't just give it straightforward

6371.219 --> 6376.82
answer to that Kevlar

6373.679 --> 6376.82
it all depends

6379.98 --> 6385.799999999999
but I I why would I have to I mean he's

6383.46 --> 6389.1
got like a whole bunch of psychopath

6385.8 --> 6392.719
slaves around him that will gladly fall

6389.1 --> 6392.719
to their knees to help him out

6393.179 --> 6397.219
so why the [ __ ] would I do that

6403.88 --> 6407.06
good point

6408.9 --> 6414.9
oh oh you said something else though

6412.44 --> 6417.0199999999995
earlier yeah you are liar get the [ __ ]

6414.9 --> 6417.0199999999995
up

6417.119 --> 6422.04
yeah you just contradicted your own

6419.58 --> 6424.83
[ __ ] [ __ ] rumor statements you

6422.04 --> 6428.04
stupid [ __ ]

6424.83 --> 6428.04
[Music]

6435.36 --> 6442.08
slandering [ __ ]

6438.36 --> 6444.54
with your [ __ ] little witch hair

6442.08 --> 6448.199
I think that's cool you think you're

6444.54 --> 6451.58
cool you stupid [ __ ] lying [ __ ] you

6448.199 --> 6454.699
think you're cool your soul is [ __ ]

6451.58 --> 6454.699
[ __ ] you

6455.34 --> 6463.669
[Music]

6466.93 --> 6475.320000000001
[Music]

6472.28 --> 6478.08
yeah so everything she just said is just

6475.32 --> 6480.36
[ __ ] to confuse us right

6478.08 --> 6483.42
probably I don't care

6480.36 --> 6485.159
he's out here she whatever I don't care

6483.42 --> 6488.159
it's fake

6485.159 --> 6490.619
making up rumors I mean there's trolls

6488.159 --> 6492.119
doing this [ __ ] about Flat Earth debate

6490.619 --> 6495.54
and about me

6492.119 --> 6497.339999999999
in other people's chaps

6495.54 --> 6499.679
right

6497.34 --> 6502.26
like in bevs

6499.679 --> 6506.34
or at glow Busters they're doing the

6502.26 --> 6509.6990000000005
same [ __ ] as this stupid [ __ ] lying

6506.34 --> 6513.3
troll was doing

6509.699 --> 6515.759999999999
they do that over there to spread crazy

6513.3 --> 6518.1
ideas about oh this is going on that's

6515.76 --> 6521.6990000000005
gone because they don't check they don't

6518.1 --> 6524.360000000001
even [ __ ] check if it's a troll man

6521.699 --> 6528.0599999999995
they're so dilapidated

6524.36 --> 6531.299999999999
cognitively over there

6528.06 --> 6534.179
due to the lack of the application of

6531.3 --> 6536.88
the Socratic method on all levels

6534.179 --> 6541.1990000000005
that they don't even check whether a

6536.88 --> 6543.84
troll is is just lying or not they don't

6541.199 --> 6546.36
so they'll probably just play into

6543.84 --> 6548.04
everything they're told by some random

6546.36 --> 6550.32
[ __ ] lying troll

6548.04 --> 6552.06
well I'm not I'm gonna ignore everything

6550.32 --> 6555.179
she just said

6552.06 --> 6558.4800000000005
because it's probably all [ __ ] oh

6555.179 --> 6560.34
journey is leaving because of this

6558.48 --> 6562.739
talking about it

6560.34 --> 6565.679
so what the [ __ ] is wrong with you

6562.739 --> 6569.58
and then say Oh Bob is dying oh that's

6565.679 --> 6573.06
why Jaron is taking also you're a liar

6569.58 --> 6576.6
then because you just said that Jared

6573.06 --> 6579.0
left you stupid lying [ __ ]

6576.6 --> 6581.219
but you think I wouldn't see that within

6579.0 --> 6584.159
the time span of five minutes how you

6581.219 --> 6586.82
literally contradicted what you said you

6584.159 --> 6586.82
dumb [ __ ]

6588.3 --> 6603.360000000001
[Music]

6600.42 --> 6606.659
what's going on I don't know not much I

6603.36 --> 6609.0
know life flattered debates I'm severely

6606.659 --> 6611.78
disappointed I'm kind of pissed off at

6609.0 --> 6611.78
this point I mean

6614.219 --> 6617.6
it's not funny

6633.56 --> 6636.7390000000005
[Music]

6642.54 --> 6647.84
right but yeah the show is growing to an

6645.719 --> 6647.84
end

6649.44 --> 6652.099999999999
foreign

6655.699 --> 6659.78
absolutely all over the place

6667.8 --> 6674.659000000001
you're not up to speed with fed what do

6670.86 --> 6674.659
you mean you're not up to speed with it

6677.88 --> 6680.900000000001
about what

6681.6 --> 6683.780000000001
foreign

6705.239 --> 6712.58
I was disappointed with fed

6708.84 --> 6712.58
did I did I say that

6719.34 --> 6721.52
foreign

6723.179 --> 6726.26
are you sure

6732.78 --> 6740.04
anything else I said the context line

6738.42 --> 6742.08
because I don't remember actually

6740.04 --> 6743.58
mentioning that oh there's no show yeah

6742.08 --> 6745.92
yeah

6743.58 --> 6746.82
of course yeah now I'm disappointed with

6745.92 --> 6750.4800000000005
that

6746.82 --> 6752.94
just Nathan just certainly

6750.48 --> 6755.58
because Nathan does doesn't actually

6752.94 --> 6757.739
like ahead a schedule like days in front

6755.58 --> 6759.719
say like okay guys I'm having these in

6757.739 --> 6761.5199999999995
these days off no it's just he doesn't

6759.719 --> 6764.699
show all of a sudden

6761.52 --> 6767.34
happened yesterday and now too I mean

6764.699 --> 6769.678999999999
he's not even there to say no show guys

6767.34 --> 6773.2390000000005
he doesn't even say it

6769.679 --> 6773.2390000000005
he's just not showing up

6773.58 --> 6777.08
that pisses me off

6780.84 --> 6790.76
right

6782.16 --> 6790.76
[Music]

6791.52 --> 6797.34
is he okay I hope so he's probably still

6794.58 --> 6799.86
having like a flu type situation that's

6797.34 --> 6800.82
what he seemed to seemed to be nagging

6799.86 --> 6803.719
him

6800.82 --> 6803.719
last week

6804.0 --> 6807.96
so is he okay

6805.56 --> 6810.6
well it might be like

6807.96 --> 6812.58
oh under the weather

6810.6 --> 6814.139
maybe he's got like a fever now or

6812.58 --> 6816.86
something

6814.139 --> 6816.86
I don't know

6817.199 --> 6822.259999999999
whatever it is there's no live stream

6819.48 --> 6825.389999999999
and I'm really disappointed

6822.26 --> 6825.39
[Music]

6830.94 --> 6836.78
my thing on this card

6833.76 --> 6836.780000000001
uh some

6838.38 --> 6843.42
some in the chat were actually in the

6841.619 --> 6844.5
Skype chat and we're actually talking

6843.42 --> 6847.82
about that

6844.5 --> 6847.82
so we'll see what happens

6850.56 --> 6853.219
right

6854.659 --> 6860.82
where's guns are never owned by the way

6858.719 --> 6864.02
he said he was going to PayPal me today

6860.82 --> 6864.0199999999995
but he hasn't shown up

6868.44 --> 6874.678999999999
he might might be doing it just during

6872.239 --> 6877.32
yeah I don't know

6874.679 --> 6879.3
anyway I could still use some support so

6877.32 --> 6882.78
I'm gonna end

6879.3 --> 6885.4800000000005
the show on that

6882.78 --> 6888.78
I really need support

6885.48 --> 6892.879999999999
I know I've been a bit cranky today

6888.78 --> 6892.88
but I mean with good reason

6893.219 --> 6897.54
and this is just something weird in the

6895.5 --> 6900.179
air today but I really need the support

6897.54 --> 6903.26
you should start an effing Newton what

6900.179 --> 6903.26
the [ __ ] does that even mean

6906.3 --> 6911.1
right

6907.679 --> 6914.46
please donate to my PayPal the link the

6911.1 --> 6918.5
PayPal is literally my email address and

6914.46 --> 6918.5
it's also in the description box below

6918.54 --> 6924.719
I really need the support literally to

6921.54 --> 6927.48
get around and get things like food

6924.719 --> 6929.699
or smokes I have to admit that I do do

6927.48 --> 6933.678999999999
that

6929.699 --> 6937.86
and yeah my finances are like not great

6933.679 --> 6941.1
for this time of the month

6937.86 --> 6944.4
so I'm gonna run into some serious

6941.1 --> 6946.7390000000005
trouble unless I get support I really

6944.4 --> 6948.9
need it

6946.739 --> 6951.86
money always takes the crankiness away

6948.9 --> 6951.86
yes that too

6955.32 --> 6961.32
although it's at the end of the show so

6957.659 --> 6964.08
but if I do get some support then

6961.32 --> 6965.46
um well tomorrow's moon will probably be

6964.08 --> 6967.8
a lot better

6965.46 --> 6970.26
right but anyway

6967.8 --> 6973.320000000001
uh yeah tomorrow I will do a show and

6970.26 --> 6975.659000000001
New Year's Eve New Year's Day I will

6973.32 --> 6978.599999999999
also do a show

6975.659 --> 6979.5599999999995
and I'm gonna probably also do like the

6978.6 --> 6984.0
uh

6979.56 --> 6987.679
tomorrow night I'm gonna do a happy New

6984.0 --> 6987.679
Year stream as traditional

6990.239 --> 6994.619
I'm looking forward to that

6992.88 --> 6998.219
although the weather might be kind of

6994.619 --> 7001.04
shitty but we'll see what happens

6998.219 --> 7003.139
all right but yeah anyway please do

7001.04 --> 7004.5199999999995

7023.48 --> 7029.54
financially next week

7026.119 --> 7032.139
on all the celebrations are finally

7029.54 --> 7032.139
passed

7032.84 --> 7041.32
I've not had like extra expenditures

7036.38 --> 7041.32
because of celebrations I don't do that

7041.599 --> 7047.42
because I can't afford it I mean I'd

7044.42 --> 7049.52
love to maybe buy some fireworks or

7047.42 --> 7052.46
something because I do actually like

7049.52 --> 7056.5
fireworks it's just that I can't afford

7052.46 --> 7056.5
it at all like at all

7056.719 --> 7063.4
if I had some giant bonus then I might

7060.739 --> 7063.4
but I don't

7068.48 --> 7075.0199999999995
dude get the [ __ ] out of your [ __ ]

7072.02 --> 7075.02
foreign

7075.56 --> 7082.580000000001
yeah you know what my spend my rent on

7079.34 --> 7085.099
like all that money from the government

7082.58 --> 7090.76
yeah rent

7085.099 --> 7090.76
rent and power bill and a little food

7092.36 --> 7096.92
yeah not enough

7094.099 --> 7099.8
it's not enough you get it [ __ ] it's

7096.92 --> 7100.82
not enough it's not enough you get it

7099.8 --> 7101.96
[ __ ]

7100.82 --> 7106.159
yeah

7101.96 --> 7107.3
social welfare is not enough it's not

7106.159 --> 7111.379999999999
enough

7107.3 --> 7114.8
it never was enough from the start

7111.38 --> 7116.119
first year and it was on that here in

7114.8 --> 7119.96
Utrecht

7116.119 --> 7121.94
I had moments where I was starving

7119.96 --> 7125.139
because it's not enough

7121.94 --> 7125.138999999999
you get it [ __ ]

7127.34 --> 7135.139
if it was enough I wouldn't be asking

7130.52 --> 7137.719
for support I would just do this

7135.139 --> 7141.08
I wouldn't be needing support I need

7137.719 --> 7146.719
support because I don't want to starve

7141.08 --> 7150.38
