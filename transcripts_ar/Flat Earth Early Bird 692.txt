there's some really bright sun

102.399 --> 108.32000000000001
and yeah some bit of cloud banks in the

106.799 --> 111.119
distance but they seem to be pulling

108.32 --> 114.479
away and it's really nice and bright

111.119 --> 117.28
not too windy but it's

114.479 --> 117.28
very cold

119.68 --> 123.43900000000001
yeah i went out for groceries in this

123.68 --> 129.84
to be fully clothed because it is really

126.84 --> 129.84
cold

132.72 --> 138.48
all right so let's see who's in chat

134.48 --> 138.48
anyway i got green tea with me

139.28 --> 147.599
good servants first rob h neil cosentino

143.04 --> 147.599
mark martin tolberg matthew mitchell

148.64 --> 153.83999999999997
i see you changed your name by the way

151.12 --> 157.84
of the account

153.84 --> 157.84
uh stop the traffic in my restaurant

163.2 --> 166.16
yeah good to see you

167.04 --> 175.35999999999999
i uh i'm feeling really restless today

171.2 --> 177.44
i've been kind of in a in an angry mood

175.36 --> 179.28
for no particular reason that i can

177.44 --> 181.35999999999999
think of it's just restless i woke up

179.28 --> 185.28
kind of restless today

181.36 --> 187.59900000000002
and a bit shouty

185.28 --> 190.64000000000001
but yeah i'm gonna try not to let that

187.599 --> 190.64
rub off on the show

192.64 --> 198.95899999999997
if youtube can get as far as to stop

195.76 --> 200.56
stalling my youtube stream does it every

198.959 --> 204.159
time just stops playing

200.56 --> 208.56
just stops it stalls just like that

204.159 --> 208.56
little circle and just stops playing

208.72 --> 212.48
just like that for no reason

224.64 --> 228.39999999999998
i'm still here though yeah of course

230.239 --> 237.12
just i don't know maybe

234.08 --> 237.12
it's also yeah

237.439 --> 242.879
second half of the dinner with

241.2 --> 244.879
with the uh yeah the vegetarian

242.879 --> 247.439
spaghetti sauce and i

244.879 --> 250.39999999999998
yeah i don't know if that's it it's like

247.439 --> 252.799
too soon to tell

250.4 --> 256.23900000000003
but i don't know we'll see it would be

252.799 --> 259.6
weird if just eating a little soy

256.239 --> 259.59999999999997
would do all that

261.199 --> 265.6
unless i am apparent unless i would be

263.44 --> 268.639
extremely sensitive to that

265.6 --> 271.68
i don't know if it's really something

268.639 --> 274.479
then i should test it more often

271.68 --> 276.56
to be sure whether it's truly true it

274.479 --> 279.199
[ __ ] up my god

276.56 --> 281.919
well yeah it it certainly does make an

279.199 --> 284.96000000000004
impact on my system but it's not like uh

281.919 --> 286.96
yeah like it's going all wrong it's all

284.96 --> 288.32
bubbly constantly or diarrhea or

286.96 --> 291.68
something no nothing

288.32 --> 294.479
the digestion just seems to go fine

291.68 --> 297.84000000000003
it's just that i'm a little bit more

294.479 --> 297.84
agitated now

302.16 --> 307.199
what would owen say about soy well he

304.479 --> 307.199
doesn't like it

308.08 --> 313.52
beef kills you oh really good servant

311.28 --> 313.52
huh

315.28 --> 318.4
well stop a traffic in my rastat i know

317.52 --> 321.75899999999996
i know

318.4 --> 324.71999999999997
i've heard that but not all

321.759 --> 326.16
supposedly not all part of the soy

324.72 --> 330.40000000000003
actually contains that

326.16 --> 333.68
estrogen mimicker it's mostly the core

330.4 --> 337.19899999999996
the seed and they supposed to

333.68 --> 339.68
get that out and then

337.199 --> 340.40000000000003
i don't know certain companies don't

339.68 --> 342.56
take it out

340.4 --> 344.63899999999995
like with certain soy milk that's what i

342.56 --> 346.88
heard but that doesn't mean that all

344.639 --> 348.56
organic soy that's just part of the food

346.88 --> 352.32
production

348.56 --> 354.8
is gonna have that

352.32 --> 357.12
that seems very unlikely yeah i know

354.8 --> 359.44
stopping traffic at my rest i had i know

357.12 --> 362.16
that's why i was concerned about it in

359.44 --> 362.16
the first place

362.4 --> 370.0
but i've had just rage days before

367.039 --> 370.4
without eating it at all so you can't

370.0 --> 374.8
yeah

370.4 --> 374.79999999999995
correlation not necessarily causation

376.4 --> 381.84
yeah it's just one one day

391.68 --> 395.84000000000003
what are you talking about

402.08 --> 406.56
two and a half days what

407.52 --> 414.34999999999997
i've only first even ate it like

410.639 --> 417.499
one and a half day ago so i don't

414.35 --> 417.499
[Music]

422.8 --> 426.0
i didn't feel like that in the evening

424.72 --> 429.199
at all

426.0 --> 436.72
and yesterday the entire day neither so

429.199 --> 439.28000000000003
i don't know right yes

436.72 --> 442.24
george stanford i know about the gmo

439.28 --> 446.55999999999995
soybeans absolutely

442.24 --> 450.24
but yeah these are organic soy

446.56 --> 453.919
this is organic soy that i'm eating

450.24 --> 454.8
and i've naturally always avoided it

453.919 --> 457.52
anyway

454.8 --> 460.0
because of kind of like yeah a bit of

457.52 --> 463.52
paranoid

460.0 --> 464.8
but i don't know i i think i should be

463.52 --> 468.08
able to trust that it

464.8 --> 470.56
it doesn't contain that the organic

468.08 --> 470.56
soy

471.199 --> 475.199
at least i'd have to actually test

473.36 --> 477.28000000000003
whether that's true or yeah well i could

475.199 --> 480.08000000000004
also i don't know

477.28 --> 482.15999999999997
take soy and just send it to a

480.08 --> 482.96
laboratory to get it tested but yeah

482.16 --> 493.84000000000003
that's

482.96 --> 493.84
that costs money

496.0 --> 503.759
okay george sanford well where is that

499.759 --> 503.759
because i'm pretty certain

504.84 --> 510.87899999999996
that

507.36 --> 511.44
in europe gmo's plants gmo crops are

510.879 --> 515.44
simply

511.44 --> 518.719
not allowed now there is like this weird

515.44 --> 521.0390000000001
like you can't grow that now if there

518.719 --> 524.1590000000001
has been issues with

521.039 --> 526.72
that you can have

524.159 --> 527.6
it sort of mixed in a little from the

526.72 --> 530.399
outside

527.6 --> 531.9200000000001
like that because of just massive

530.399 --> 535.12
industries

531.92 --> 535.76
like that but it's not allowed to be

535.12 --> 538.88
grown

535.76 --> 538.88
here in europe

542.56 --> 547.4399999999999
and like all the organic

545.839 --> 549.44
well i don't know actually where they

547.44 --> 550.9590000000001
get the soy they don't specifically

549.44 --> 554.08
write that up unless you buy it

550.959 --> 555.76
separately i could do that

554.08 --> 557.36
could just look into it a little bit

555.76 --> 560.24
more but

557.36 --> 562.24
yeah i heard this a long time ago that

560.24 --> 564.24
issue with the soy it's not all of it

562.24 --> 568.399
it's only it only happens when you grind

564.24 --> 568.399
up the entire soybean including the core

569.76 --> 573.519
and i i have a suspicion because i

572.56 --> 576.56
haven't actually

573.519 --> 578.399
figured that out maybe i heard about it

576.56 --> 581.279
once but it's like a long time ago

578.399 --> 581.6
somewhere on natural news or something

581.279 --> 585.12
that

581.6 --> 588.399
they basically get the core out

585.12 --> 591.76
send that to like laboratories

588.399 --> 594.64
that make like yeah estrogen

591.76 --> 595.04
things estrogen medical products and

594.64 --> 598.24
then

595.04 --> 602.8389999999999
yeah the rest of soybean is just the

598.24 --> 605.839
protein food part that doesn't contain

602.839 --> 605.839
that

608.8 --> 612.24
but yeah i'd have to actually check that

611.6 --> 615.6800000000001
out

612.24 --> 619.839
do some research in the field

615.68 --> 619.8389999999999
to be certain whether that is the case

625.6 --> 633.839
anyway hey john bernards

642.64 --> 647.8389999999999
the painters in what are you talking

644.839 --> 647.839
about

653.519 --> 657.6
what are you talking about george

658.839 --> 661.839
sanford

673.92 --> 679.1999999999999
oh okay matthew mitchell thanks

680.24 --> 689.839
very funny

692.0 --> 695.92
i'm pretty sure i'm doing all right i

694.16 --> 696.48
just got really pissed off because of

695.92 --> 700.64
some

696.48 --> 702.64
esoteric things me trying to figure out

700.64 --> 704.8
basically what really happened in my

702.64 --> 707.6
past on the spiritual side because it's

704.8 --> 709.76
freaking complex and confusing

707.6 --> 711.6
and everything seems contradictory

709.76 --> 714.24
constantly

711.6 --> 716.0
and yeah the dark world delusion came

714.24 --> 719.2
out of that

716.0 --> 719.92
but that delusion is what my mind made

719.2 --> 722.0790000000001
of it

719.92 --> 724.56
eventually because i wasn't able to

722.079 --> 725.8389999999999
actually deal with it

724.56 --> 728.079
but that doesn't mean that certain

725.839 --> 731.2
things did not happen were not said

728.079 --> 733.279
on the other side by certain figures and

731.2 --> 734.8000000000001
i'm just trying to puzzle out how this

733.279 --> 737.2
is really working

734.8 --> 738.0
because i'm pretty sure that i didn't

737.2 --> 740.8000000000001
understand

738.0 --> 741.36
at the time and i'm trying to figure it

740.8 --> 743.8389999999999
out

741.36 --> 744.639
but that's really frustrated and

743.839 --> 746.72
confronting

744.639 --> 749.12
sometimes because i'm basically

746.72 --> 751.839
remembering certain very harsh things

749.12 --> 751.839
that were said

753.44 --> 758.48
that at the time i kind of like tried to

756.959 --> 761.5999999999999
resist

758.48 --> 763.44
but there was just something to it it's

761.6 --> 765.6800000000001
not like oh i believe it but

763.44 --> 766.639
like if it is said then there is

765.68 --> 768.56
something to it

766.639 --> 772.24
and i have to figure out what that is if

768.56 --> 774.4799999999999
it's simply me overcoming it

772.24 --> 776.88
or whether it is like something i cannot

774.48 --> 776.88
avoid

778.16 --> 784.48
anyway yeah and dwelling on those things

781.92 --> 786.0
really make me stressed out make me very

784.48 --> 789.279
angry especially towards

786.0 --> 789.279
myself from the past

789.44 --> 801.839
for my own weakness

807.68 --> 815.8389999999999
okay george sanford i'll

810.8 --> 815.8389999999999
check that out

826.839 --> 831.519
oh

828.639 --> 831.519
what the [ __ ]

833.839 --> 837.2790000000001
well that that's okay i i didn't know i

836.72 --> 840.9590000000001
thought

837.279 --> 843.04
that it was forbidden i guess they

840.959 --> 845.92
by the way that link you gave me doesn't

843.04 --> 849.12
actually say that

845.92 --> 849.12
but that's fine

851.519 --> 857.839
let me check the other one

860.48 --> 867.839
son of a [ __ ] seriously

863.68 --> 871.12
fire the european commission

867.839 --> 874.399
fire them all disgusting unelected

871.12 --> 878.079
bureaucratic piece of [ __ ] you genesis

874.399 --> 879.04
scumbags how dare they [ __ ] approve

878.079 --> 882.88
gmos

879.04 --> 886.56
how [ __ ] dare they i i

882.88 --> 890.079
i'm thanks yeah this is great but

886.56 --> 891.1199999999999
however that still doesn't mean that

890.079 --> 894.3199999999999
there's going to be

891.12 --> 899.519
yeah modified soybeans

894.32 --> 903.839
in organic food

899.519 --> 903.839
though but it's still it's still messed

910.839 --> 913.839
up

924.839 --> 927.839
so

928.72 --> 932.48
okay well i'm reading in between there

931.68 --> 934.4799999999999
also that

932.48 --> 937.44
at least there's a limit to the

934.48 --> 941.839
allowance of it 10 years apparently

937.44 --> 941.839
and it has to be labeled and traceable

942.639 --> 947.279
so at least you'll be knowing when there

944.56 --> 951.4399999999999
is genetically modified [ __ ]

947.279 --> 951.759
in something not like in america where

951.44 --> 955.759
they

951.759 --> 958.16
they literally don't even have to say it

955.759 --> 962.16
so that's something but it's still wrong

958.16 --> 962.16
it's still absolutely wrong to have that

965.71 --> 969.839
[Music]

966.839 --> 969.839
here

984.24 --> 986.72
anyway

993.58 --> 997.839
[Music]

994.839 --> 997.839
right

999.04 --> 1011.8389999999999
yeah there was plenty of things

1000.399 --> 1011.839
happening yesterday

1013.68 --> 1017.12
yeah stubborn trafficking arrest hat

1015.279 --> 1019.8389999999999
that is a that is a

1017.12 --> 1022.839
potential but on the other hand it's

1019.839 --> 1024.4
also been proven that genetically

1022.839 --> 1027.52
modified

1024.4 --> 1029.8390000000002
parts tend to

1027.52 --> 1030.799
basically extinguish themselves over

1029.839 --> 1034.799
time

1030.799 --> 1037.9189999999999
because they are just not viable

1034.799 --> 1038.24
their genetic blueprint is weaker so

1037.919 --> 1040.72
they

1038.24 --> 1042.72
it every every genetically modified

1040.72 --> 1046.559
organism that's been made

1042.72 --> 1050.84
over time eradicates itself

1046.559 --> 1053.84
so i'm not too scared about that rest

1050.84 --> 1053.84
ahead

1059.919 --> 1063.1200000000001
i'm not even scared of genetically

1061.679 --> 1064.64
modified things

1063.12 --> 1067.12
you know that idea that it's going to

1064.64 --> 1071.1200000000001
overtake nature is just not true

1067.12 --> 1071.12
it's wrong it eradicates itself

1071.44 --> 1080.559
it can't last in nature

1075.36 --> 1082.8799999999999
nature can though

1080.559 --> 1085.36
it's just yeah you don't want to eat

1082.88 --> 1087.44
poison that's the main reason why

1085.36 --> 1088.799
why genetically modified food is such a

1087.44 --> 1090.96
terrible idea because

1088.799 --> 1092.799
yeah you can eat it while it's still

1090.96 --> 1095.2
viable

1092.799 --> 1096.08
but it can still survive in a

1095.2 --> 1098.64
concentrated

1096.08 --> 1100.48
bread form and then you can be poisoned

1098.64 --> 1103.3600000000001
by it yeah

1100.48 --> 1109.84
but over time if you just leave it out

1103.36 --> 1109.84
it's all gonna die out all of it

1115.32 --> 1118.82
[Music]

1120.84 --> 1123.84
so

1162.84 --> 1169.1999999999998
goody

1164.24 --> 1169.2
all right cars you had cars that's great

1174.24 --> 1178.24
anyway yeah i had a bit of a clash

1176.64 --> 1180.72
yesterday i don't know

1178.24 --> 1181.679
nathan even recorded that or cut that

1180.72 --> 1183.6000000000001
out or anything

1181.679 --> 1186.0800000000002
i think it was during the live show but

1183.6 --> 1188.3999999999999
a bit of a clash with him

1186.08 --> 1190.32
because he was trying to treat me like a

1188.4 --> 1192.16
baller and he was just

1190.32 --> 1194.08
basically he got it wrong what i was

1192.16 --> 1197.2
trying to say but that's because it was

1194.08 --> 1197.1999999999998
very complicated

1197.28 --> 1204.3999999999999
and yeah

1200.799 --> 1206.1589999999999
he misunderstood the foundation of my

1204.4 --> 1207.2
trainer thinking and started to straw

1206.159 --> 1210.48
man and

1207.2 --> 1212.0800000000002
accidentally at first but then he was

1210.48 --> 1215.44
basically just holding on to that and

1212.08 --> 1215.4399999999998
that really pissed me off

1216.32 --> 1221.84
and yeah i did not back down

1222.0 --> 1225.919
so but yeah we'll see after that by the

1225.36 --> 1228.32
way i

1225.919 --> 1229.3600000000001
i basically dropped off because i did

1228.32 --> 1231.36
not feel like

1229.36 --> 1233.52
yeah being part of the show after that

1231.36 --> 1237.1999999999998
point

1233.52 --> 1238.96
but uh yeah in the after show it which

1237.2 --> 1241.44
lasted very long by the way it's two

1238.96 --> 1243.52
hour after show yesterday

1241.44 --> 1245.3600000000001
with ballers and everything but i got

1243.52 --> 1248.72
back in the hangout again and

1245.36 --> 1249.4399999999998
just still partook in the after show and

1248.72 --> 1252.64
that was a

1249.44 --> 1255.76
that was good it was just fine

1252.64 --> 1256.64
it's just nathan and me i get well

1255.76 --> 1260.4
nathan got

1256.64 --> 1263.039
up got caught up in the moment

1260.4 --> 1264.88
and because he is just used to doing a

1263.039 --> 1265.84
show biting down on the ballers like

1264.88 --> 1270.88
that

1265.84 --> 1270.8799999999999
he gets very tenacious as a force of
