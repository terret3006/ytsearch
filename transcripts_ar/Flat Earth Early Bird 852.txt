110.88 --> 118.079
warm day so far

115.119 --> 119.68
it's the sun i bet though that if a

118.079 --> 123.36
cloud goes in front of the sun

119.68 --> 124.0
it gets pretty cold i didn't get all

123.36 --> 127.04
cooked

124.0 --> 130.72
this morning when i was sleeping so i

127.04 --> 133.93
completely used the situation to really

130.72 --> 135.44
take some extra sleep

133.93 --> 143.84
[Music]

135.44 --> 147.68
and i'm still on time how about that

143.84 --> 152.879

147.68 --> 152.87900000000002
the 3rd of april 2021

154.72 --> 161.599
brand m first in chat good to see you

158.56 --> 164.959
luna wolf 704

161.599 --> 168.79999999999998
clutch bear yeah you are early

good good to have you in chat early

168.84 --> 171.84
uh

175.599 --> 180.879
all right looks like somebody is early

178.72 --> 180.879
in

182.08 --> 190.31900000000002
on the baller side

185.76 --> 193.44
who promises to be in a

190.319 --> 198.319
a day of baller versus flat

193.44 --> 201.12
oh well hello cameron kamigaza gilmore

198.319 --> 201.11999999999998
good to see you

202.319 --> 205.51899999999998
so yeah today i am feeling better than

204.799 --> 209.12
yesterday

205.519 --> 213.84
sizably my shoulder is

209.12 --> 213.84
less tense

215.2 --> 221.2
and yeah i think it really does have

218.64 --> 224.319
a lot to do with the coffee drinking

221.2 --> 226.48
especially when i do it in the evening

224.319 --> 228.64
it's a big difference so i'm i'm

226.48 --> 232.07999999999998
literally gonna cut down on it and just

228.64 --> 232.07999999999998
keep it to the morning coffee

236.4 --> 241.84
so yeah i'm feeling pretty good today

245.76 --> 249.76
stayed up pretty late though yesterday

251.84 --> 256.159
let's see oh no i forgot to make notes

258.0 --> 262.56
right right now i remember uh yeah there

261.04 --> 264.639
was the flat earth debate

262.56 --> 266.88
and it was pretty good i was very active

264.639 --> 268.72
in it

266.88 --> 272.32
especially during the live show part i

268.72 --> 272.32000000000005
did go out for groceries though

273.28 --> 280.4
and yeah there was a special

276.72 --> 280.40000000000003
a live special over there

281.199 --> 287.6
over at uh nathan oakley's ryan had a

284.72 --> 287.6
presentation

288.639 --> 294.88
uh about the different

291.84 --> 298.4
air layers and the yeah a

294.88 --> 299.6
a heat situation where it's actually

298.4 --> 302.96
decreasing in heat

299.6 --> 304.96000000000004
supposedly at certain air layers

302.96 --> 306.71999999999997
where before it was colder and that is

304.96 --> 310.96
kind of weird and you address that

306.72 --> 314.16
and yeah

310.96 --> 316.4
it was good to be part of that panel

314.16 --> 317.199
i was actually like during the first

316.4 --> 319.28
half of that

317.199 --> 321.12
i was like laying in bed kind of

319.28 --> 323.44
sleeping sort of

321.12 --> 324.24
because i had just done groceries and

323.44 --> 327.44
that really

324.24 --> 329.36
wore on my shoulder so i did like a

327.44 --> 332.96
quick nap but then

329.36 --> 332.96000000000004
pretty much snapped out of it

334.479 --> 339.59999999999997
maybe that helped too i think i should

336.16 --> 343.12
do that more often just like

339.6 --> 343.52000000000004
short healing naps i think that'll help

343.12 --> 346.88
my

343.52 --> 346.88
shoulder situation too

349.52 --> 354.479
right but that was pretty good i don't

351.28 --> 354.479
know if anybody's seen that

354.56 --> 367.84
do check it out

368.0 --> 371.84
i caught a little bit of jaron live

372.96 --> 378.479
what's he talking about again this time

376.319 --> 381.84000000000003
oh yeah i think he was trying to focus a

378.479 --> 381.84
lot on religion

382.72 --> 388.319
from his perspective

386.0 --> 389.199
and he was trying like a new show format

388.319 --> 393.03900000000004
his intro

389.199 --> 393.68
was pretty good like it was really good

393.039 --> 397.199
actually

393.68 --> 401.44
so very impressive intro

397.199 --> 403.44
and then he that he now has for his new

401.44 --> 409.84
show

403.44 --> 409.84
uh what else

420.8 --> 424.8
all right let me just

425.12 --> 431.759
browse through the youtube

428.56 --> 431.759
notification oh yeah

434.08 --> 440.24
yeah there was a i also got on brandon's

437.52 --> 440.24
a little bit

440.96 --> 444.96
but it was like it was quite a hassle to

443.36 --> 446.24
do that because it was pretty much in

444.96 --> 449.28
the middle of the night for me

446.24 --> 451.919
and yeah people are sleeping here and

449.28 --> 452.96
yeah things get very round and rowdy

451.919 --> 455.44
over at brandon's

452.96 --> 458.0
especially this time when george and

455.44 --> 460.8
yeti nuke and rumpus was in there

458.0 --> 464.08
and brian also moved in he kind of like

460.8 --> 467.199
took over after i kind of dropped off

464.08 --> 470.96
but rumpus was like being

467.199 --> 473.12
super triggered like he was like

470.96 --> 474.479
blaspheming and cursing all over the

473.12 --> 476.96
place like he was

474.479 --> 479.12
like really pissed off out of his out of

476.96 --> 482.96
his game almost

479.12 --> 482.96
like out of his character

483.68 --> 493.84000000000003
that was weird so rumpus had a bad mood

488.08 --> 493.84
on that and

494.479 --> 498.31899999999996
uh what was it again talking about the

497.12 --> 501.44
supposed yeah the

498.319 --> 503.599
hangout from the day before the

501.44 --> 504.8
ring laser gyro i don't know it wasn't

503.599 --> 507.199
really anything

504.8 --> 507.91900000000004
super interesting but it was just funny

507.199 --> 510.24
to see

507.919 --> 511.919
the ballers in there going back and

510.24 --> 513.839
forth doing their typical thing

511.919 --> 516.159
and george netanyahu like i haven't

513.839 --> 521.839
heard from him in a long time and he was

516.159 --> 521.8389999999999
in there too

526.24 --> 531.12
right so and that's pretty much where i

528.16 --> 531.12
rounded out my day

532.839 --> 535.839
oh

547.36 --> 549.839
what

550.88 --> 563.8389999999999
okay luna wolf what do you want

565.92 --> 569.8389999999999
do you think earth is flat i don't care

568.48 --> 572.9590000000001
if you don't

569.839 --> 574.48
if you do but if you do i don't agree

572.959 --> 577.8389999999999
okay

574.48 --> 577.839
luna wolf that's

578.08 --> 581.12
your prerogative

581.6 --> 588.72
right oh yeah and that reminds me that

585.279 --> 588.72
attitude like a rumpus

589.279 --> 593.279
like in a snippet of the conversation

591.2 --> 595.6800000000001
like it is hilarious to have rumpus in

593.279 --> 599.68
any kind of room he always goes full

595.68 --> 603.04
rumpus he always starts to like

599.68 --> 605.1999999999999
just zealously assert his

603.04 --> 606.64
the his way of thinking and how to do

605.2 --> 609.519
things like

606.64 --> 612.0
the baller morality almost it's really

609.519 --> 612.0
bizarre

612.16 --> 617.04
but he like somebody reminded him of the

615.04 --> 617.68
like aristocenes came up and all that

617.04 --> 621.279
and how

617.68 --> 622.4799999999999
we don't presuppose the earth is a ball

621.279 --> 625.12
with that

622.48 --> 626.399
when measuring the sun angles and all oh

625.12 --> 629.279
no of course you don't

626.399 --> 630.88
sure right but then somebody reminded

629.279 --> 634.24
him yeah there's also this

630.88 --> 635.68
what is it a chinese aristos everyone's

634.24 --> 639.04
like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

635.68 --> 641.4399999999999
and then somebody said i don't

639.04 --> 644.24
exactly know who that was like yeah but

641.44 --> 647.6
he actually

644.24 --> 650.24
used that same setup to yeah

647.6 --> 651.76
precip or rather to come to the

650.24 --> 654.72
conclusion the earth is flat

651.76 --> 656.72
and rumpus like immediately yeah so then

654.72 --> 659.0400000000001
he's wrong

656.72 --> 660.5600000000001
but why he did the same thing well

659.04 --> 663.279
because

660.56 --> 664.399
he concluded the earth is flat so it

663.279 --> 667.2
must be wrong

664.399 --> 667.76
this is like he must have been wrong

667.2 --> 671.36
it's so

667.76 --> 671.36
zealous it's just ridiculous

673.44 --> 678.8000000000001
it really is like a religious objective

676.24 --> 679.6
to just like everybody has to think it's

678.8 --> 681.4399999999999
a ball

679.6 --> 683.519
like it doesn't even matter anymore if

681.44 --> 688.6400000000001
it is a ball you just have to think it's

683.519 --> 691.839
a ball or you're wrong

688.64 --> 694.88
and yeah luna wolf 704 kind of reminds

691.839 --> 694.8800000000001
me a little about that

695.279 --> 703.8389999999999
so far

713.36 --> 717.839
ah green tea

734.0 --> 737.92
right so yeah brandon's can be pretty

736.32 --> 740.8000000000001
amusing but eventually

737.92 --> 743.92
like flat earthers versus globers like

740.8 --> 745.3599999999999
especially if flat earthers get annoyed

743.92 --> 748.8
and also getting rumpus

745.36 --> 750.48
by others and by the ballers then like

748.8 --> 752.639
the typically what i notice about the

750.48 --> 755.6800000000001
brandon's room is that like the

752.639 --> 757.92
the mood gets really spoiled

755.68 --> 758.7199999999999
and just people lose their patience with

757.92 --> 761.8389999999999
each other and

758.72 --> 764.48
also just start rhombusing like i

761.839 --> 766.399
even had to throw back in my own actions

764.48 --> 767.04
because i did like to put some input in

766.399 --> 770.32
there

767.04 --> 772.0
i had to use the old style so what i

770.32 --> 775.2
typically did with the flat earth debate

772.0 --> 777.12
when it was a little bit more rowdy to

775.2 --> 780.8000000000001
really find the right moment and just

777.12 --> 783.279
insert certain words and

780.8 --> 784.3199999999999
kind of like focus so that it will be

783.279 --> 788.32
heard

784.32 --> 788.32
even if people talk over one another

788.399 --> 791.92
it's like an armenian insertion to

790.8 --> 795.4399999999999
ensure that it

791.92 --> 797.76
that that piece of info gets through in

795.44 --> 801.839
the moment

797.76 --> 801.8389999999999
and that does work

805.36 --> 809.76
you don't mean to come off that way luna

807.44 --> 809.7600000000001
wolf

813.68 --> 819.5999999999999
well your entry was pretty much yo it's

816.079 --> 822.2399999999999
not flat it's not flat

819.6 --> 823.279
and even if you do think it's flat i

822.24 --> 825.36
disagree with you

823.279 --> 828.079
well if you don't want to come across

825.36 --> 830.8000000000001
that way then

828.079 --> 830.8
maybe you should

831.279 --> 837.92
carefully examine how what it is you do

834.48 --> 837.9200000000001
when you enter a chat room

839.279 --> 843.76
think about it anyway hey hello amanda

842.16 --> 846.639
young good morning

843.76 --> 849.199
number one flat earther i thank you

846.639 --> 849.199
amanda

851.44 --> 855.519
yeah the super chat i i saw your super

853.92 --> 856.0
chat over at the flat earth debates

855.519 --> 859.04
you're you're

856.0 --> 863.519
a real sweetheart thank you for that

859.04 --> 863.519
oh steamy traveler good to see you

865.839 --> 871.6
have i ever tried panel of guests on my

867.839 --> 876.0790000000001
show yes i have

871.6 --> 878.16
but i'm not always in the mood for that

876.079 --> 881.4399999999999
it's it's been kind of complicated

878.16 --> 885.199
sometimes it's good to have somebody on

881.44 --> 888.5600000000001
especially when i kind of like need

885.199 --> 890.88
an interaction more to keep flowing

888.56 --> 892.3199999999999
like when i typically am like very

890.88 --> 894.399
silent that's

892.32 --> 895.6800000000001
the moment when i actually could use a

894.399 --> 898.88
panel

895.68 --> 899.8389999999999
but other times no i'm just fine just

898.88 --> 902.48
being me

899.839 --> 904.32
on my own here on my show with people in

902.48 --> 907.12
chat

904.32 --> 909.1990000000001
but then again hey if somebody like has

907.12 --> 910.9590000000001
something urgent to report

909.199 --> 913.4399999999999
or whatever like for example sleeping

910.959 --> 916.399
warrior sometimes does

913.44 --> 917.9200000000001
then yeah you are welcome to call me up

916.399 --> 921.199
through skype

917.92 --> 923.04
like i would always accept adam mekin on

921.199 --> 925.519
as a guest for example if he wanted to

923.04 --> 927.76
come on

925.519 --> 928.8
and of course nathan too but he's yeah

927.76 --> 932.16
he's too busy

928.8 --> 936.079
so nathan really doesn't have time

932.16 --> 936.079
anymore for like social calls on other

938.839 --> 941.6
shows

940.0 --> 943.279
sorry you're tired not thinking about

941.6 --> 945.36
which oh so are you

943.279 --> 948.079
like in australia or something or

945.36 --> 948.0790000000001
somewhere in

948.72 --> 955.839
like japan or china or korea

956.399 --> 959.12
luna wolf

960.16 --> 963.12

stayed up all night oh in the us oh why

983.92 --> 989.759
did you do that

985.92 --> 992.88
that's not really the best way to

989.759 --> 997.1990000000001
to get in my chat

992.88 --> 1000.56
you're all knackered

997.199 --> 1000.56
why did you stay up all night

1005.759 --> 1011.04
anime oh you've been binge watching or

1008.839 --> 1014.8800000000001
something

1011.04 --> 1017.06
luna wolf maybe you should just get some

1014.88 --> 1020.11
sleep

1017.06 --> 1020.1099999999999
[Music]

1021.12 --> 1028.16
huh oh hey amanda young

1024.88 --> 1039.2800000000002
paypal again really

1028.16 --> 1042.48
wow you spoil me

1039.28 --> 1045.76
wow thank you very much amanda

1042.48 --> 1048.64
thank you very much it's

1045.76 --> 1048.64
most welcome

1050.88 --> 1057.679
ah it

1054.64 --> 1061.5200000000002
it is funny there i i do feel

1057.679 --> 1064.96
it feels silly to say it but i feel a

1061.52 --> 1064.96
correlation between

1066.559 --> 1071.44
between the paypal and my shoulder

1070.24 --> 1074.559
tension it is so

1071.44 --> 1078.0
funny it's like immediately i noticed

1074.559 --> 1080.16
it it feels so silly to say this is not

1078.0 --> 1083.87
an act this is not me

1080.16 --> 1085.44
trying to play my audience this is real

1083.87 --> 1089.28
[Music]

1085.44 --> 1091.679
and it helps like yeah financial stress

1089.28 --> 1092.48
i don't let it sit on my conscious

1091.679 --> 1095.2800000000002
because then it's

1092.48 --> 1096.88
really gonna drive me nuts and i have

1095.28 --> 1099.12
like trust in god

1096.88 --> 1100.48
trust that i'll be all right that he'll

1099.12 --> 1103.76
provide enough

1100.48 --> 1103.76
through everybody and

1104.48 --> 1112.24
through the cosmos in order for me to

1108.16 --> 1114.88
to get around and learn lessons etc etc

1112.24 --> 1117.6
but still just like on an earthly level

1114.88 --> 1121.0390000000002
it does stress me out it stresses out my

1117.6 --> 1123.76
my physical being i guess

1121.039 --> 1125.12
maybe it's like my remote grabbler

1123.76 --> 1128.96
genetics from my

1125.12 --> 1128.9599999999998
great-grandpa's side or something

1130.0 --> 1140.72
i heard he was like

1137.36 --> 1142.559
judean or something anyway

1140.72 --> 1144.4
maybe that is why i get stressed out

1142.559 --> 1147.36
about it because on the same

1144.4 --> 1148.799
side yeah i'm not super good and focused

1147.36 --> 1151.12
on managing it

1148.799 --> 1152.799
never i always dislike money dealing

1151.12 --> 1154.4799999999998
with it but i have to deal with it

1152.799 --> 1157.44
because you live in a world where

1154.48 --> 1160.559
yeah if you don't really deal with it

1157.44 --> 1160.559
it's gonna deal with you

1160.72 --> 1166.799
but it's just this yeah visceral impact

1164.08 --> 1166.799
it is real

1167.679 --> 1173.44
but i'm very glad that it does help

1171.039 --> 1175.44
it was already kind of like getting

1173.44 --> 1178.799
better

1175.44 --> 1181.919
maybe because yesterday

1178.799 --> 1193.84
did i do a dna chest i haven't

1181.919 --> 1193.8400000000001
done a dna test ever

1194.0 --> 1197.44
you seem very chill

1201.679 --> 1207.1200000000001
well yeah today i'm i'm kind of relaxed

1205.2 --> 1209.3600000000001
if that is what you're implying luna

1207.12 --> 1209.36
wolf

1211.28 --> 1217.52
oh hey sticking star water

1214.799 --> 1217.52
montana

1219.2 --> 1223.039
oh you got beautiful sights cool

1224.799 --> 1229.2
i might have some really cool ancestry

1226.96 --> 1229.2
oh

1231.12 --> 1236.7199999999998
i've got some weird ancestry

1234.32 --> 1236.72
at least

1245.84 --> 1252.1589999999999
but right yeah the direct i've

1248.88 --> 1252.64
like through my dad's side of the family

1252.159 --> 1256.64
they

1252.64 --> 1256.64
there were people there that did like

1257.679 --> 1260.96
get the family lineage all worked out

1260.24 --> 1264.48
and all that

1260.96 --> 1266.0
they did that that's also how my dad

1264.48 --> 1271.3600000000001
knows about

1266.0 --> 1271.36
great grandpa being being judaic

1272.08 --> 1276.08
or a judean what did i do what was the

1274.24 --> 1277.039
right terminology for it again i don't

1276.08 --> 1280.0
remember

1277.039 --> 1282.799
but yeah a literal genetics test no i

1280.0 --> 1282.799
haven't done that

1285.76 --> 1291.76
like even in the time where i was

1287.679 --> 1295.679
interested in that sort of thing

1291.76 --> 1297.52
like i was basically

1295.679 --> 1300.64
too scared that they're just gonna use

1297.52 --> 1301.679
it to harvest my genetics and then do

1300.64 --> 1304.96
voodoo [ __ ]

1301.679 --> 1306.64
on it or something right and maybe it

1304.96 --> 1310.159
has happened

1306.64 --> 1312.48
but no very little

1310.159 --> 1314.3200000000002
like it might have literally been that

1312.48 --> 1317.2
like

1314.32 --> 1318.8799999999999
the fear of realizing what is actually

1317.2 --> 1321.8400000000001
going down in the world

1318.88 --> 1323.3600000000001
impressed me so badly in a time that i

1321.84 --> 1325.36
couldn't really handle it and it was

1323.36 --> 1328.08
still this sensitive

1325.36 --> 1329.36
that it just mirrored itself in my

1328.08 --> 1332.6399999999999
dreams

1329.36 --> 1334.0
as a like a vision and because of a lot

1332.64 --> 1336.48
of personal confusion

1334.0 --> 1336.48
and all that

1338.159 --> 1342.0800000000002
like i mistaken some of these

1340.96 --> 1344.559
experiences

1342.08 --> 1346.799
from a dark world vision that might have

1344.559 --> 1350.24
basically been a projection of the

1346.799 --> 1352.1589999999999
idea as if it were physically

1350.24 --> 1355.28
as if it had physically happened and

1352.159 --> 1358.5590000000002
what added to this confusion is that

1355.28 --> 1361.6
i basically shared this confused state

1358.559 --> 1366.08
with certain people some of them

1361.6 --> 1368.48
actually played it so they reified it

1366.08 --> 1370.32
like it did happen and i couldn't tell

1368.48 --> 1370.64
the difference and they kind of played

1370.32 --> 1374.559
me

1370.64 --> 1377.5200000000002
on it that's what i realized

1374.559 --> 1378.32
right they bluffed it they took my

1377.52 --> 1382.24
delusion

1378.32 --> 1382.24
and literally played me with it

1382.4 --> 1389.039
that sort of thing happened in my past

1385.919 --> 1393.71
it's very mean-spirited really but i do

1389.039 --> 1395.36
understand like the curiosity of it

1393.71 --> 1398.799
[Music]

1395.36 --> 1403.28
but it has made quite like

1398.799 --> 1407.76
a negative impact really

1403.28 --> 1411.6
but cherokee i don't think i have any

1407.76 --> 1413.76
native american ancestry i as a baby i

1411.6 --> 1414.9599999999998
did go to america and there's still this

1413.76 --> 1418.48
picture of me

1414.96 --> 1419.679
my mother holding me and definitely

1418.48 --> 1424.72
native american

1419.679 --> 1424.72
holding her baby next to each other

1425.12 --> 1431.84
but genetically i don't think so

1434.24 --> 1438.96
look our ancestors i don't think any of

1437.52 --> 1444.48
them

1438.96 --> 1444.48
went to america or something like that

1449.52 --> 1456.8799999999999
okay hello

1452.84 --> 1461.1999999999998
wdp 2020

1456.88 --> 1466.159
hello wayne c horse

1461.2 --> 1466.159
or c c howars

1466.48 --> 1470.799
what how do you pronounce that seahorse

1469.84 --> 1473.84
or whatever

1470.799 --> 1473.84
yeah welcome to the chat

1498.08 --> 1501.84
all right

1517.44 --> 1522.64
right but as for genetic tests no i've

1520.4 --> 1525.76
i've never participated in that never

1522.64 --> 1528.0800000000002
had some kind of stupid swap test

1525.76 --> 1531.6
that are very likely to actually be

1528.08 --> 1534.96
harvesting genetic data

1531.6 --> 1538.8799999999999
it's like metadata and have never

1534.96 --> 1538.88
actually ever participated in that

1541.2 --> 1545.1200000000001
so in a way my genetics are perhaps a

1544.4 --> 1549.6000000000001
mystery

1545.12 --> 1549.6
or maybe somebody did actually just

1550.88 --> 1557.8400000000001
do that and didn't tell me

1567.679 --> 1573.76
right but if they did then i think

1570.799 --> 1575.679
i'm not really that special genetically

1573.76 --> 1578.64
because i didn't get anybody

1575.679 --> 1579.1200000000001
like oh you're you're a special breed or

1578.64 --> 1582.64
something

1579.12 --> 1586.8799999999999
no my spirit has been very special

1582.64 --> 1590.72
and people have recognized that but

1586.88 --> 1590.72
perhaps that's just the spirit

1597.52 --> 1601.36
right in that sense maybe the way that i

1600.08 --> 1605.1999999999998
am

1601.36 --> 1607.76
yes i have various components which

1605.2 --> 1608.48
are hereditary like in my family they

1607.76 --> 1612.1589999999999
show it to

1608.48 --> 1615.039
like capacity to observe

1612.159 --> 1616.3200000000002
carefully like a lot of creative

1615.039 --> 1619.039
sensitivity

1616.32 --> 1619.4399999999998
like picking up on things details right

1619.039 --> 1626.24
but

1619.44 --> 1628.24
how i am

1626.24 --> 1629.76
i think it's more like because of my

1628.24 --> 1633.1200000000001
spirit

1629.76 --> 1636.0
which it is rather unique

1633.12 --> 1638.32
in my family since most in my family are

1636.0 --> 1638.32
very

1638.96 --> 1643.279
have a tendency to statism like they

1642.159 --> 1646.3200000000002
want to

1643.279 --> 1648.96
they have a rebellious spirit but they

1646.32 --> 1651.4399999999998
as far as you know all they don't really

1648.96 --> 1653.76
rebel

1651.44 --> 1654.559
so in that i'm a bit of an exception a

1653.76 --> 1657.679
black sheep

1654.559 --> 1659.52
if you will and maybe i also chose this

1657.679 --> 1661.679
role

1659.52 --> 1663.039
but that's not a very typical role to

1661.679 --> 1669.8400000000001
choose for

1663.039 --> 1669.84
people like in my family

1676.24 --> 1683.44
and that might also be be because well

1680.24 --> 1685.76
also hereditary is adaptability

1683.44 --> 1687.1200000000001
like mental flexibility and hey when you

1685.76 --> 1690.399
can adapt

1687.12 --> 1690.399
it's very efficient

1691.52 --> 1696.799
and you don't get the system against you

1693.919 --> 1698.48
so it is more appealing to adapt and do

1696.799 --> 1701.679
that

1698.48 --> 1704.559
with my genetics probably i presume

1701.679 --> 1705.76
that my hereditary my family that

1704.559 --> 1711.84
ability

1705.76 --> 1711.84
but i chose not to do it

1724.0 --> 1728.32
i'm a good huma good enough human good

1726.24 --> 1731.679
enough right clutch bear

1728.32 --> 1739.76
that's fine you know most of us are more

1731.679 --> 1745.039
defined by our spirit anyway

1739.76 --> 1748.32
like spirit first like ability second

1745.039 --> 1751.2
now abilities are important and you will

1748.32 --> 1754.0
typically when trying to accomplish

1751.2 --> 1758.0800000000002
something and working on things

1754.0 --> 1759.84
people do like to gather other people

1758.08 --> 1761.1999999999998
based on having the right spirit

1759.84 --> 1764.48
compatibility

1761.2 --> 1767.52
personality to certain levels and

1764.48 --> 1770.32
their skill set skill sets are

1767.52 --> 1771.76
valuable especially when you have when

1770.32 --> 1775.12
you know multiple people

1771.76 --> 1776.559
then it compounds all the different

1775.12 --> 1781.84
skill sets together

1776.559 --> 1781.84
it helps

1785.84 --> 1790.32
hashtag fema oh that that's terrible

1792.24 --> 1799.76
all right okay luna wolf sure ask

1796.0 --> 1802.799
trump or biden are you kidding me

1799.76 --> 1805.52
why are you asking me that

1802.799 --> 1805.52
i'm dutch

1806.48 --> 1810.72
like i i can't really vote either way

1818.96 --> 1824.88
but overall on average i did like trump

1822.559 --> 1824.8799999999999
better

1826.64 --> 1832.5590000000002
just got a little messy at the end the

1829.76 --> 1835.36
stupid vaccine situations

1832.559 --> 1836.72
and all that i really did not like that

1835.36 --> 1841.039
he did that

1836.72 --> 1841.039
that's that was just very out of place

1842.559 --> 1846.8799999999999
but biden is is just like a sock puppet

1846.159 --> 1851.2
man

1846.88 --> 1854.3200000000002
it's terrible and he really i think

1851.2 --> 1855.1200000000001
like uh even alex jones is laying that

1854.32 --> 1857.039
out like

1855.12 --> 1859.12
and others too you know a lot of people

1857.039 --> 1862.64
speculate about this stuff

1859.12 --> 1862.6399999999999
he is really a fall guy

1862.88 --> 1871.279
and he knows it like biden

1866.799 --> 1875.44
knows he's screwed like he knows it

1871.279 --> 1878.32
and he's like fine whatever i'm screwed

1875.44 --> 1892.0800000000002
i'm just gonna do what i'm gonna do and

1878.32 --> 1893.84
until i collapse

1892.08 --> 1895.6789999999999
all our script well of course they're

1893.84 --> 1898.799
all scripted

1895.679 --> 1899.44
but that that doesn't mean they have no

1898.799 --> 1902.559
control

1899.44 --> 1904.72
over this over their script though

1902.559 --> 1906.24
it's just that a lot of these people

1904.72 --> 1909.2
choose to completely

1906.24 --> 1911.36
relinquish to the autoscript to the

1909.2 --> 1914.24
writing team to the one that is

1911.36 --> 1915.76
puzzling the efficient effects and

1914.24 --> 1917.679
result based

1915.76 --> 1918.799
objectives and all that yeah a lot of

1917.679 --> 1921.1200000000001
these politicians

1918.799 --> 1924.96
just surrender to it unless they have

1921.12 --> 1927.36
still some kind of personal vision

1924.96 --> 1928.48
and then they may develop that a little

1927.36 --> 1934.24
themselves

1928.48 --> 1937.1200000000001
and nudge the script a little right

1934.24 --> 1938.159
but president biden is just going

1937.12 --> 1941.279
autopilot

1938.159 --> 1944.0800000000002
right now and he has been for so

1941.279 --> 1944.08
for some time

1947.76 --> 1953.6
president harris is already looking for

1949.84 --> 1953.6
material the oval office kenya

1958.559 --> 1962.96
biden wants to better the american

1961.279 --> 1964.399
healthcare are you kidding me monk

1962.96 --> 1968.08
patrol

1964.399 --> 1968.08
are you [ __ ] me dude

1971.6 --> 1977.84
no insurance you're doomed

1974.64 --> 1977.8400000000001
nah that's not how it works

1982.32 --> 1985.2
there look

1985.76 --> 1990.0
this is just politics like i don't want

1988.24 --> 1992.96
to explain this to a freaking

1990.0 --> 1996.32
baller like monk patrol crying out loud

1992.96 --> 1996.32
you should know better than that

2001.76 --> 2008.559
he wants to improve it well it's

2004.799 --> 2010.6399999999999
his side that literally has engaged in

2008.559 --> 2011.9189999999999
wrecking the health care system

2010.64 --> 2014.7990000000002
literally

2011.919 --> 2015.519
obamacare was a giant disaster made

2014.799 --> 2018.0
things a

2015.519 --> 2020.3990000000001
lot worse totally wrecked the health

2018.0 --> 2023.519
care system it was fine

2020.399 --> 2027.279
you don't need freaking auto

2023.519 --> 2033.84
insurance it doesn't work it just

2027.279 --> 2033.84
it just degrades the medical system

2035.14 --> 2038.199
[Music]

2052.72 --> 2056.24
under the impression that someone told

2054.56 --> 2060.0
you no no mark's my leader

2056.24 --> 2062.3199999999997
i told me

2060.0 --> 2065.599
i understand you you have been

2062.32 --> 2065.599
commenting for a while

2065.679 --> 2075.839
i know how you think nobody told me that

2069.2 --> 2075.839
mark smile here

2086.839 --> 2089.839
ah

2093.04 --> 2097.44
right well monk patrol health care

2095.52 --> 2100.0
system is all about the cash

2097.44 --> 2100.64
yeah well that is the problem and that

2100.0 --> 2103.359
problem

2100.64 --> 2105.7599999999998
is not going to go away when you

2103.359 --> 2107.92
automate the payment system

2105.76 --> 2110.4
right it's still going to be about the

2107.92 --> 2112.48
money the problem is is the healthcare

2110.4 --> 2113.6800000000003
system should be about healthcare and

2112.48 --> 2115.28
not about the money

2113.68 --> 2117.839
you're not going to change that by

2115.28 --> 2120.7200000000003
giving everybody insurance

2117.839 --> 2122.0
it's not going to make the medical

2120.72 --> 2125.1189999999997
system

2122.0 --> 2125.119
less greedy

2126.24 --> 2131.839
it doesn't work that way

2155.04 --> 2163.2799999999997
right yeah monk patrol but dude

2159.359 --> 2163.2799999999997
yeah i know it is kind of ridiculous

2166.56 --> 2172.48
but it's also because of

2169.76 --> 2173.6800000000003
just how the medical system in general

2172.48 --> 2175.839
has been

2173.68 --> 2176.7999999999997
has come to work it's all been

2175.839 --> 2187.839
corporatized

2176.8 --> 2187.8390000000004
like it it didn't used to be like that

2188.0 --> 2195.52
so the the problem is the format

2191.599 --> 2195.52
the format of the medical system

2197.599 --> 2201.44
and that they have let in basically big

2200.48 --> 2204.64
pharma

2201.44 --> 2208.079
to such extent to kind of keep it

2204.64 --> 2211.04
afloat without it costing

2208.079 --> 2211.44
direct money in a tax sense and all that

2211.04 --> 2213.359
but

2211.44 --> 2215.119
but it's just screwed up the medical

2213.359 --> 2216.96
system so now it literally

2215.119 --> 2220.8
doesn't function the way it should it's

2216.96 --> 2224.16
become separated corporate

2220.8 --> 2227.2000000000003
like necromantic it's just not

2224.16 --> 2228.56
effective anymore that's the problem and

2227.2 --> 2231.7599999999998
just giving everybody

2228.56 --> 2233.839
money to be able to engage

2231.76 --> 2235.28
with that corrupted system that

2233.839 --> 2237.92
fundamentally

2235.28 --> 2239.44
corrupted system not necessarily even

2237.92 --> 2242.56
because of the people but just

2239.44 --> 2245.68
because of the way how it's become

2242.56 --> 2246.24
it's not going to change it you see the

2245.68 --> 2250.48
problem

2246.24 --> 2254.24
is the corporatization

2250.48 --> 2256.72
that's the problem problem is not

2254.24 --> 2259.04
that people can't afford it the problem

2256.72 --> 2262.64
is the corporatization

2259.04 --> 2266.72
that's the problem there should be

2262.64 --> 2269.2799999999997
much simpler

2266.72 --> 2270.8799999999997
medical systems like really that are

2269.28 --> 2274.48
still effective that are still

2270.88 --> 2276.88
all about like yeah patching up people

2274.48 --> 2278.72
when they get into accidents all that

2276.88 --> 2282.1600000000003
and treating

2278.72 --> 2285.9199999999996
like serious conditions and all that

2282.16 --> 2287.04
but yeah it should be more efficient and

2285.92 --> 2290.56
not so much

2287.04 --> 2293.839
all about money it's just gonna draw in

2290.56 --> 2297.2799999999997
people that want money anyway like that

2293.839 --> 2300.72
so that's the only incentive left then

2297.28 --> 2303.52
it should work better less money

2300.72 --> 2304.16
less pushy less psychological warfare

2303.52 --> 2309.44
less

2304.16 --> 2312.56
sneaky conspiracy trickery and scams

2309.44 --> 2313.52
among one another and more actual

2312.56 --> 2316.64
healing

2313.52 --> 2320.32
but also just more space

2316.64 --> 2324.0
for themselves they need more

2320.32 --> 2324.4
time off to have some peace otherwise

2324.0 --> 2328.16
they're

2324.4 --> 2330.2400000000002
just gonna get to railroad mode

2328.16 --> 2331.7599999999998
that's why money works because it's the

2330.24 --> 2333.52
money that like

2331.76 --> 2336.4
pulls them in on the high level

2333.52 --> 2339.68
functioning and then keeps them in

2336.4 --> 2342.88
so they even like their damage their own

2339.68 --> 2344.7999999999997
constitution on the long run

2342.88 --> 2348.7200000000003
because it's just the whole medical

2344.8 --> 2348.7200000000003
system set up is just screwed

2349.44 --> 2355.839
it's all being wasted it's not healing

2352.88 --> 2355.839
barely

2359.68 --> 2363.44
and that's not even a political debate

2362.48 --> 2366.16
luna

2363.44 --> 2367.28
is universal it's not one side or the

2366.16 --> 2371.359
other it's literally

2367.28 --> 2371.3590000000004
just the medical system how it works

2371.76 --> 2378.96
what it has become that's the problem

2375.839 --> 2383.839
not if people can pay to engage it

2378.96 --> 2383.839
the problem is what it's become

2389.2 --> 2394.72
right and i blame also just the things

2392.0 --> 2398.24
like the rockefeller foundation

2394.72 --> 2401.359
like they set the standard for the

2398.24 --> 2404.0789999999997
western medical system and

2401.359 --> 2405.2
yeah the people that set it up are the

2404.079 --> 2408.8390000000004
bad guys

2405.2 --> 2412.16
like blatantly obvious so they took

2408.839 --> 2414.7999999999997
control and when these people set up

2412.16 --> 2415.92
long-term plans they always do it to

2414.8 --> 2418.079
take control

2415.92 --> 2421.599
take it away from the people and then

2418.079 --> 2421.599
weaponize it against them

2421.92 --> 2427.92
that's what they do with everything they

2423.76 --> 2427.92
touch everything they take control of

2435.28 --> 2438.7200000000003
how many years are we from a one world

2437.2 --> 2441.8799999999997

2679.839 --> 2682.88
all right dutch sailor

2684.079 --> 2687.44
sorry did i miss something yeah thank

2686.8 --> 2690.4
god there

2687.44 --> 2691.44
and still enough good people around yeah

2690.4 --> 2693.28
well good people

2691.44 --> 2695.04
wake up you know this is how it

2693.28 --> 2697.92
typically works so

2695.04 --> 2698.4
everybody pretty much starts out good

2697.92 --> 2701.599
then

2698.4 --> 2703.6800000000003
things corrupt one bit at a time it

2701.599 --> 2705.28
slightly crumbles and then at some point

2703.68 --> 2707.04
when the crumbling starts to hurt

2705.28 --> 2709.44
everybody

2707.04 --> 2711.119
then some people basically lose

2709.44 --> 2714.2400000000002
themselves into it

2711.119 --> 2717.28
become a zombie to the system and others

2714.24 --> 2721.68
they snap out of it and they take

2717.28 --> 2724.0
on the fight the psychological fight at

2721.68 --> 2724.0
first

2724.079 --> 2729.119
and then they just stay

2730.839 --> 2733.839
separate

2736.079 --> 2739.44
unfortunately though those that have

2737.839 --> 2741.599
already kind of corrupted

2739.44 --> 2744.0
and are like the older ones that are

2741.599 --> 2746.96
really deeply ingrained they can't

2744.0 --> 2748.96
wake up like they probably would want to

2746.96 --> 2751.04
they just can't anymore

2748.96 --> 2752.88
because they're literally entangled in

2751.04 --> 2755.599
things

2752.88 --> 2755.599
and yeah

2756.72 --> 2760.0
like they could not survive the

2758.56 --> 2762.24
consequences probably

2760.0 --> 2764.16
if they did that because of everything

2762.24 --> 2766.24
they did

2764.16 --> 2775.839
like once you double down too deeply

2766.24 --> 2775.839
there's no way back

2777.839 --> 2783.68
some half ears are still asleep or still

2781.28 --> 2783.6800000000003
sleep

2784.0 --> 2788.319
well they just start to slumber again

2786.079 --> 2790.1600000000003
you know just because you wake up from

2788.319 --> 2792.64
one dream doesn't mean that you're not

2790.16 --> 2792.64
going to

2793.28 --> 2797.76
catch another dream and a lot of people

2800.839 --> 2803.839
do

2819.68 --> 2822.56
what the [ __ ]

2826.8 --> 2831.76
no no mark schmelier i did not have that

2829.04 --> 2834.319
dream

2831.76 --> 2836.48
that's never been part of my vision it's

2834.319 --> 2838.64
actually quite the opposite

2836.48 --> 2841.2
my vision started with me literally

2838.64 --> 2845.5989999999997
ascending out of my body with full blown

2841.2 --> 2848.8799999999997
angel wings and flight ability

2845.599 --> 2852.1600000000003
in a in a big shadowy realm

2848.88 --> 2855.119
well not shadowy it's just a blackness

2852.16 --> 2859.839
a blackness and a floor and light came

2855.119 --> 2859.839
from me

2860.72 --> 2867.2799999999997
so not falling or

2864.319 --> 2868.64
waking up with nightmares no nothing

2867.28 --> 2873.8390000000004
nothing like that

2868.64 --> 2873.839
i've rarely had nightmares like that

2874.4 --> 2878.7200000000003
i did have them when i was really young

2876.96 --> 2879.52
but yeah when i was really young i was

2878.72 --> 2881.4399999999996
living more

2879.52 --> 2884.079
in that freaking dream world than it was

2881.44 --> 2884.8
in the real world as in like 80 percent

2884.079 --> 2887.8390000000004
of the time

2884.8 --> 2890.079
with my waking consciousness

2887.839 --> 2891.04
like as a really little kid i lived in

2890.079 --> 2892.7200000000003
the dream world

2891.04 --> 2895.119
i absolutely like people had to

2892.72 --> 2898.0
constantly snap me back into reality to

2895.119 --> 2898.0
get my attention

2898.839 --> 2901.839
constantly

2902.64 --> 2907.1189999999997
batman for that well the flying dream

2904.559 --> 2909.2000000000003
yeah well i've had flying dreams

2907.119 --> 2910.96
since as far as i can remember it's like

2909.2 --> 2912.8799999999997
my first dream that i can't remember

2910.96 --> 2914.0
from as a kid when i was five was a

2912.88 --> 2916.2400000000002
flying dream i still

2914.0 --> 2917.68
remember every detail about it and how

2916.24 --> 2919.839
it felt

2917.68 --> 2922.319
and i've mastered flight in dreams in

2919.839 --> 2924.7999999999997
the regular dream state right

2922.319 --> 2926.8
but that's not the same as vision

2924.8 --> 2928.6400000000003
division memories that's different

2926.8 --> 2931.52
that really was like an out-of-body

2928.64 --> 2936.24
experience type thing

2931.52 --> 2940.48
where my spirit literally just got

2936.24 --> 2940.4799999999996
yeah launched into the the other

2940.839 --> 2943.839
dimension

2954.839 --> 2957.839
so

2957.92 --> 2961.52
about to dream about that right well

2960.559 --> 2964.4
maybe perhaps

2961.52 --> 2965.359
yeah well maybe i don't want to know

2964.4 --> 2968.319
about those

2965.359 --> 2968.96
evil techniques yeah maybe i don't want

2968.319 --> 2972.24
to know

2968.96 --> 2974.2400000000002
about that that if somebody like

2972.24 --> 2976.319
is in that state oh they happen to be

2974.24 --> 2978.0789999999997
very suggestible yeah yeah

2976.319 --> 2979.52
that's freaking necromancer knowledge

2978.079 --> 2983.76
yeah

2979.52 --> 2986.079
i don't need to know that

2983.76 --> 2986.079
ever

2992.24 --> 2995.52
all right and yeah in my vision which

2994.72 --> 2997.839
was not

2995.52 --> 2999.28
the state that you described mark smiley

2997.839 --> 3002.319
yeah

2999.28 --> 3004.4
i i they attempted to indoctrinate me

3002.319 --> 3006.64
all over the place

3004.4 --> 3008.64
i had very little defense against the

3006.64 --> 3011.7599999999998
outside influences that were messing

3008.64 --> 3015.7599999999998
with me as soon as i got in there

3011.76 --> 3018.559
although i they could not really

3015.76 --> 3020.4
reach into my spirit they couldn't do

3018.559 --> 3022.88
anything with that

3020.4 --> 3025.44
they could insert information however

3022.88 --> 3028.4
and i had very little

3025.44 --> 3029.04
like we've got a cognitive shielding

3028.4 --> 3032.48
ability

3029.04 --> 3033.52
in the vision itself it had cognitive

3032.48 --> 3035.44
processing

3033.52 --> 3037.119
but no shielding so it's almost like

3035.44 --> 3041.44
everything i was told i

3037.119 --> 3042.2400000000002
had to i had to accept and ingrain it

3041.44 --> 3045.28
somehow

3042.24 --> 3048.64
give it a spot in like a fifth

3045.28 --> 3050.559
dimensional way it's bizarre

3048.64 --> 3052.48
but the whole experience like that was

3050.559 --> 3054.48
bizarre because it was timeless it was

3052.48 --> 3056.2400000000002
literally like being unstuck in time and

3054.48 --> 3059.92
so everything that happens

3056.24 --> 3061.52
is always like everything that happens

3059.92 --> 3069.839
is always

3061.52 --> 3069.839
it's yeah that sounds very ethereal

3087.92 --> 3093.2000000000003
all the signs that you're an illuminati

3090.8 --> 3093.2000000000003
puppet

3093.76 --> 3098.8
scattered influences on me like what

3096.8 --> 3100.88
can you be more specific which

3098.8 --> 3104.559
illuminati influences because

3100.88 --> 3108.4
oh yeah i saw [ __ ] i definitely

3104.559 --> 3108.4
definitely saw [ __ ] in my vision

3108.839 --> 3114.48
like i think sometimes

3111.359 --> 3117.52
that alex jones had the same or

3114.48 --> 3118.319
partially the same vision but he also

3117.52 --> 3122.079
has done

3118.319 --> 3122.079
actual physical research a lot

3122.24 --> 3126.64
but i saw all kinds of bizarre things i

3125.599 --> 3130.0
saw

3126.64 --> 3133.359
the pyramid eyes like living things

3130.0 --> 3136.8
pyramid shaped and eyes in clouds

3133.359 --> 3140.16
and they wanted they wanted

3136.8 --> 3143.44
basically to destroy everything like

3140.16 --> 3147.2
the destruction would be like

3143.44 --> 3148.079
it would yield energy it would yield

3147.2 --> 3150.0789999999997
meaning

3148.079 --> 3152.0
like on a higher dimensional level that

3150.079 --> 3155.44
was basically what they were suggesting

3152.0 --> 3158.72
to me and

3155.44 --> 3161.599
like they did not have sensitivity

3158.72 --> 3164.48
so they completely lacked like these the

3161.599 --> 3167.52
energy of these entities

3164.48 --> 3167.92
the spirit frequency they had they had

3167.52 --> 3172.4
no

3167.92 --> 3175.599
feelings like they had no human

3172.4 --> 3176.7200000000003
subtlety at all so effectively i

3175.599 --> 3181.2000000000003
considered that

3176.72 --> 3185.1189999999997
psychopathic like psychopathic spirits

3181.2 --> 3189.1189999999997
and i absolutely did not

3185.119 --> 3195.839
did not engage like i listened to them

3189.119 --> 3195.839
i did nothing they said nothing

3203.28 --> 3209.8390000000004
like i dude my vision big it was big

3210.0 --> 3214.72
at some point it was literally like i

3212.48 --> 3216.64
entered a narnian realm

3214.72 --> 3218.8799999999997
like a magical realm where just

3216.64 --> 3223.04
everything was

3218.88 --> 3225.2000000000003
totally surreal like

3223.04 --> 3226.8
there was like life and environment but

3225.2 --> 3230.8799999999997
it was all spirit-based

3226.8 --> 3230.88
not the typical physical based

3231.52 --> 3237.839
it's yeah it's hard to describe

3242.079 --> 3245.6800000000003
you don't believe in illumina all

3244.559 --> 3249.599
illuminati

3245.68 --> 3249.5989999999997
is in illuminati okay

3249.839 --> 3253.119
the aluminum ones

3261.16 --> 3268.96
aluminum what

3264.16 --> 3268.96
talk about misspelling but anyway

3269.28 --> 3276.1600000000003
you can't stop there oh thank you mark

3272.24 --> 3279.2799999999997
smiler thank you that you can protect me

3276.16 --> 3282.16
against the evil spirits i i am so

3279.28 --> 3282.799
desperate for that it's not like i

3282.16 --> 3286.48
pretty much

3282.799 --> 3286.48
dedicated my entire life

3287.28 --> 3294.6400000000003
to being protected and pretty much

3290.559 --> 3294.6400000000003
sacrificed everything for that

3294.799 --> 3301.119
so but thanks for the offer i don't need

3297.839 --> 3301.119
somebody to protect me

3301.52 --> 3307.839
right i got my own sources

3326.48 --> 3339.04
what the [ __ ] are you yeah

3335.2 --> 3342.319
program oh my god

3339.04 --> 3345.599
okay mark like dude

3342.319 --> 3349.2799999999997
get a freaking point and don't

3345.599 --> 3352.48
[ __ ] savage me with your stupid

3349.28 --> 3355.76
pseudo spiritual [ __ ] okay

3352.48 --> 3359.359
like i'm sick of it i'd rather listen to

3355.76 --> 3364.0
merle's explanation about this [ __ ]

3359.359 --> 3366.5589999999997
because at least at times he tries

3364.0 --> 3367.119
because you're just trying to play me

3366.559 --> 3370.1600000000003
mark

3367.119 --> 3372.96
mark's my lear i know you're trying to

3370.16 --> 3376.3999999999996
play me you have been trying to play me

3372.96 --> 3379.68
for two years give it up

3376.4 --> 3382.559
you can't play me you can't fool me

3379.68 --> 3383.9199999999996
this is a guy that can't get grabble

3382.559 --> 3388.6400000000003
anymore okay

3383.92 --> 3388.64
you can't do it it's just

3389.2 --> 3395.5989999999997
the armor of god here you can't do it

3392.559 --> 3398.559
i'm not gonna fall for your [ __ ]

3395.599 --> 3399.3590000000004
your paranoia seeding and gaslighting me

3398.559 --> 3403.28
into

3399.359 --> 3406.48
oh oh i can protect you no mark smiler

3403.28 --> 3408.2400000000002
no give it up

3406.48 --> 3409.68
you've been trying for two years it's

3408.24 --> 3412.4799999999996
not gonna work

3409.68 --> 3414.319
and over time it's only going to work

3412.48 --> 3419.839
less

3414.319 --> 3419.839
give it up

3426.319 --> 3429.52
now they did not make me think anything

3429.04 --> 3432.4
i

3429.52 --> 3434.799
make me think yeah there is nobody

3432.4 --> 3438.319
freaking instructing me

3434.799 --> 3440.64
nobody right not even god

3438.319 --> 3441.359
is instructing me even though i probably

3440.64 --> 3444.4
should follow

3441.359 --> 3444.64
instructions from god it's just i let

3444.4 --> 3446.7200000000003
him

3444.64 --> 3448.24
give me the information i'm allowed to

3446.72 --> 3453.68
have

3448.24 --> 3453.68
right i'm not taking orders

3453.839 --> 3463.119
right i'm following objectives

3458.079 --> 3467.2000000000003
my objectives mine

3463.119 --> 3475.839
right and they are

3467.2 --> 3475.839
immovable they will be what they are

3500.38 --> 3503.739
[Music]

3504.799 --> 3508.559
iron 26 that's nice

3511.52 --> 3517.839
it's not very healthy though

3513.44 --> 3517.839
cheeseburger with a side of fries

3529.2 --> 3534.3999999999996
why you ended up flat broke with as few

3532.0 --> 3537.92
friends as possible now why i ended up

3534.4 --> 3542.48
flat broke is because

3537.92 --> 3545.119
i'm just not very good with man money

3542.48 --> 3546.64
and very few friends yeah you know why

3545.119 --> 3550.799
that happened

3546.64 --> 3554.5589999999997
because i rejected

3550.799 --> 3558.079
them do you understand

3554.559 --> 3561.119
not the other way around i rejected them

3558.079 --> 3562.799
i didn't want to deal with their

3561.119 --> 3565.839
[ __ ] anymore

3562.799 --> 3569.52
right and that's on average my problem

3565.839 --> 3573.04
with knowing people on the long run

3569.52 --> 3573.7599999999998
some point when i know they have some

3573.04 --> 3576.079
[ __ ]

3573.76 --> 3577.8390000000004
in their behavior and they're like

3576.079 --> 3579.599
holding on to it

3577.839 --> 3581.599
like they don't even give recognition

3579.599 --> 3584.0
that they should change it

3581.599 --> 3586.6400000000003
and then when i try to help them meddle

3584.0 --> 3589.839
with them personally yeah i do that

3586.64 --> 3592.24
eventually i will i'm i am like that i

3589.839 --> 3593.359
i am very manipulative in trying to help

3592.24 --> 3596.64
people

3593.359 --> 3600.96
right but only when i know like

3596.64 --> 3602.96
for real it's an issue

3600.96 --> 3604.0
with them like in a one-on-one

3602.96 --> 3606.16
communication and

3604.0 --> 3608.559
nowadays i look more for signs that they

3606.16 --> 3608.5589999999997
actually

3609.04 --> 3613.44
know it's there because first they have

3611.44 --> 3617.119
to realize it's there

3613.44 --> 3620.64
then they have to recognize

3617.119 --> 3623.76
they have an issue then

3620.64 --> 3626.799
they need to find a way

3623.76 --> 3627.44
to deal with it and grow out of it and

3626.799 --> 3630.319
that's a

3627.44 --> 3631.599
very difficult set of stairs to follow

3630.319 --> 3634.88
for anybody because

3631.599 --> 3638.079
everybody's dealing with issues every

3634.88 --> 3640.96
freaking person in the world

3638.079 --> 3643.04
and you don't really see it as much on

3640.96 --> 3643.52
average unless you've got the eye for it

3643.04 --> 3646.24
because

3643.52 --> 3648.48
people are on average more proficient in

3646.24 --> 3651.4399999999996
hiding their issues from the outside

3648.48 --> 3654.2400000000002
world than they are in fixing them

3651.44 --> 3655.52
right i got a special eye for that i can

3654.24 --> 3659.2
see right through it it's

3655.52 --> 3662.799
called well

3659.2 --> 3664.24
call it pseudo telepathy it's not real

3662.799 --> 3667.359
telepathy

3664.24 --> 3671.5989999999997
it's basically back engineering through

3667.359 --> 3675.7599999999998
mighty oversight

3671.599 --> 3678.88
it works and i use my intuition for it

3675.76 --> 3680.96
but yeah helping to correct people to

3678.88 --> 3683.359
get over their issues

3680.96 --> 3684.319
which i guess it is more like a

3683.359 --> 3686.319
relationship

3684.319 --> 3687.68
it's like a relationship attitude it's

3686.319 --> 3690.079
just that

3687.68 --> 3691.44
i have that with everybody because i

3690.079 --> 3694.319
bond

3691.44 --> 3695.76
really deeply by myself naturally with a

3694.319 --> 3699.04
person when i

3695.76 --> 3701.5200000000004
actually go face to face with them and i

3699.04 --> 3705.2799999999997
also wait for opportunities to show

3701.52 --> 3707.44
my more inner torture and grief like oh

3705.28 --> 3712.799
yeah i need to kind of tell you i'm also

3707.44 --> 3716.079
dealing with this [ __ ]

3712.799 --> 3718.88
and once that's unchained then

3716.079 --> 3721.6800000000003
i can be more fully myself more the

3718.88 --> 3725.92
wider spectrum without having the top

3721.68 --> 3726.3999999999996
and the bottom cut off at my full range

3725.92 --> 3728.319
self

3726.4 --> 3729.599
that i can display in front of those

3728.319 --> 3732.4
people and

3729.599 --> 3741.839
with the energies and the abilities that

3732.4 --> 3741.839
come with them

3743.68 --> 3748.96
306. what's your analysis on me am i a

3746.72 --> 3752.3999999999996
realist or what am i

3748.96 --> 3755.76
i don't know you're you have a lot of

3752.4 --> 3759.2000000000003
young energy

3755.76 --> 3762.48
so you seem to be a very

3759.2 --> 3766.8799999999997
brave individual socially

3762.48 --> 3769.92
realist i think you're trying to be

3766.88 --> 3773.52
but you do get preoccupied with

3769.92 --> 3776.559
social engagement and competition

3773.52 --> 3779.44
right and that is

3776.559 --> 3780.6400000000003
less of realist but yeah you are

3779.44 --> 3783.68
definitely

3780.64 --> 3786.8799999999997
trying to be a realist and

3783.68 --> 3797.839
i have seen the growth so you're

3786.88 --> 3797.839
definitely improving

3799.76 --> 3803.92
arweeny and empathy very well explained

3808.839 --> 3811.839
thanks

3820.24 --> 3824.24
if space is fake what are all the lights

3822.079 --> 3827.44
in the sky well lights in the sky

3824.24 --> 3829.5989999999997
right slow slow-mo moon buggy beat me to

3827.44 --> 3829.599
it

3830.96 --> 3835.119
there's light manifest it's not even

3834.24 --> 3838.9599999999996
coming from

3835.119 --> 3842.799
literal things in a position on earth

3838.96 --> 3845.359
in in the sky it's just light manifest

3842.799 --> 3846.64
it's like coming from that direction

3845.359 --> 3850.0
visible

3846.64 --> 3867.839
to those that are in that position

3850.0 --> 3867.839
almost like a visual side effect

3880.079 --> 3887.44
oh damn did i already do an hour

3884.4 --> 3891.039
sheesh man

3887.44 --> 3893.599
this show really flew by

3891.039 --> 3897.2000000000003
but i guess yeah it was good and i had

3893.599 --> 3900.4900000000002
some maneuvering room to talk about some

3897.2 --> 3902.24
intrinsic spiritual things

3900.49 --> 3904.24
[Music]

3902.24 --> 3906.799
but it's kind of difficult to just

3904.24 --> 3910.24
overtly talk about it you know

3906.799 --> 3913.359
it i can reveal more about my vision

3910.24 --> 3914.0
which just a giant giant thing it's 80

3913.359 --> 3917.359
years

3914.0 --> 3917.76
it's like an 80-year film in 4d okay

3917.359 --> 3921.68
it's

3917.76 --> 3924.7200000000003
unbelievable that's why it's very tough

3921.68 --> 3926.8799999999997
like i can't just from beginning to end

3924.72 --> 3929.68
lay it down it's impossible

3926.88 --> 3930.7200000000003
but if somebody asks me especially if it

3929.68 --> 3932.48
is verbally

3930.72 --> 3936.0
if i'm with somebody and they basically

3932.48 --> 3939.44
like interrogate or interview or however

3936.0 --> 3942.4
inquire then

3939.44 --> 3944.4
i can put down a whole lot and i'll do

3942.4 --> 3947.92
it like

3944.4 --> 3950.2400000000002
in a shamanistic way too and that's what

3947.92 --> 3952.48
happened when uh yeah way back with the

3950.24 --> 3956.3999999999996
interview i had uh

3952.48 --> 3959.68
with josh over at iron realm on the uh

3956.4 --> 3962.7200000000003
was it truth frequency radio

3959.68 --> 3964.64
i that one i did there it was addressed

3962.72 --> 3967.1189999999997
and it works well if somebody is

3964.64 --> 3970.64
literally just going to inquire about it

3967.119 --> 3970.6400000000003
then i can also stay focused

3972.48 --> 3976.48
three marks my leader he's not blocked

3976.839 --> 3979.839
rufus

3985.76 --> 3990.559
any thoughts on the nes

3990.72 --> 3994.9599999999996
nintendo entertainment system nah just

3992.72 --> 3996.64
kidding a second sun video what second

3994.96 --> 3998.64
sun video i don't know about a second

3996.64 --> 4001.52
sun video

3998.64 --> 4002.799
yeah by the way look i'm feeling it's

4001.52 --> 4005.599
going so well

4002.799 --> 4007.839
i might do another hour today but we'll

4005.599 --> 4007.839
see

4009.28 --> 4015.3590000000004
maybe yeah 25 more minutes

4012.559 --> 4018.079
or maybe an hour it depends on on what's

4015.359 --> 4019.92
gonna roll out

4018.079 --> 4022.1600000000003
but i don't want to end the show just

4019.92 --> 4022.16
yet

4025.599 --> 4035.839
mark was deleted was he deleted

4030.96 --> 4035.839
what no he's been timed out

4038.079 --> 4042.4
and that was over five minutes ago so

4043.44 --> 4049.839
he should be able to comment it could be

4045.44 --> 4049.839
that he just stepped away

4052.319 --> 4059.2799999999997
asling seconds and video

4055.599 --> 4060.0
i haven't seen it but is this again

4059.28 --> 4062.0
about oh

4060.0 --> 4063.839
special filter and then you see like

4062.0 --> 4066.96
another

4063.839 --> 4068.64
well sun hologram in another location is

4066.96 --> 4070.559
that it because i have seen

4068.64 --> 4077.839
those types of videos before that's been

4070.559 --> 4077.8390000000004
around for like five years

4079.76 --> 4087.3590000000004
right yeah well second sun

4084.079 --> 4087.6800000000003
it's very easy to conclude that a second

4087.359 --> 4089.92
sun

4087.68 --> 4092.3999999999996
is not caused by a literal second sun

4089.92 --> 4095.52
but that well it's an indicator to me

4092.4 --> 4098.719
again that the sun is more

4095.52 --> 4103.12
comparable to like a lens flare effect

4098.719 --> 4105.279
it's very obvious what a lens flare is

4103.12 --> 4106.719
like you can spot it being a lens flare

4105.279 --> 4108.2390000000005
and not being a physical thing in a

4106.719 --> 4110.64
literal position right

4108.239 --> 4111.3589999999995
and i think that the sun in its own way

4110.64 --> 4113.839
is

4111.359 --> 4114.4800000000005
like a lens flare a secondary effect

4113.839 --> 4117.6
it's not

4114.48 --> 4119.599999999999
the causal effect of

4117.6 --> 4120.64
the sunlight and all that no it's the

4119.6 --> 4123.1990000000005
side effect

4120.64 --> 4124.56
so if you're going by that standard by

4123.199 --> 4128.4
that standard of approach

4124.56 --> 4130.88
then yeah second sun i don't know

4128.4 --> 4132.48
it doesn't mean all that much it's just

4130.88 --> 4134.719
like oh yeah there you have another side

4132.48 --> 4136.639999999999
effect

4134.719 --> 4147.12
it's still not coming from a literal

4136.64 --> 4150.56
object in a literal position so

4147.12 --> 4153.44
the light brings the sun well or just

4150.56 --> 4154.88
that light associated with the sun when

4153.44 --> 4157.2789999999995
you look at it

4154.88 --> 4158.400000000001
you see the disk like a holographic

4157.279 --> 4162.400000000001
signature

4158.4 --> 4165.599999999999
that just is visible when

4162.4 --> 4168.4
you're in direct contact

4165.6 --> 4171.04
with the sunlight that's kind of how i

4168.4 --> 4174.879999999999
approach it now

4171.04 --> 4177.839
so the the sun disc is secondary

4174.88 --> 4177.839
it's not primary

4184.4 --> 4188.4
do i still watch your own benjamin yeah

4186.159 --> 4192.5599999999995
of course i do

4188.4 --> 4192.5599999999995
it's not always though but a lot of it

4196.719 --> 4199.84
but yeah sometimes when i'm in a certain

4198.64 --> 4203.12
type of mood it's

4199.84 --> 4205.1990000000005
like i it's kind of like a bit punishing

4203.12 --> 4206.5599999999995
because i just get really envious and

4205.199 --> 4210.96
[ __ ] i'm like uh

4206.56 --> 4210.96
must be nice but

4212.96 --> 4218.4
too bad other times it's just

4216.08 --> 4218.4
great

4219.679 --> 4226.0
i can't comment anymore though like i

4222.96 --> 4227.6
have to have a special invite i think

4226.0 --> 4231.84
but i'm just watching through the gary

4227.6 --> 4231.84
and terry uh youtube show

4235.199 --> 4239.04
yesterday's stream was great i think i

4237.92 --> 4241.36
missed it

4239.04 --> 4243.12
but that's probably because yeah the

4241.36 --> 4244.719
there was an extra flat earth debate

4243.12 --> 4247.28
show

4244.719 --> 4247.28
let me see

4256.84 --> 4259.84
huh

4263.04 --> 4267.44
right barricade garage

4267.52 --> 4273.84
yeah i no i completely missed out on

4269.76 --> 4273.84
that i didn't even pick up it was there

4283.16 --> 4286.239
[Music]

4298.84 --> 4305.28
so

4300.32 --> 4305.28
what come on amanda

4306.32 --> 4313.599999999999
just look

4309.679 --> 4317.04
whatever yeah okay maybe i'm smarter

4313.6 --> 4320.719
well he's a lot more successful okay

4317.04 --> 4323.36
he is a really good comedian

4320.719 --> 4324.4800000000005
he's very brave and he has a lot of

4323.36 --> 4327.839999999999
energy

4324.48 --> 4329.599999999999
and he does have a lot of spiritual

4327.84 --> 4332.64
sharpness

4329.6 --> 4333.120000000001
right so it i don't know man it's to

4332.64 --> 4336.8
compare

4333.12 --> 4339.5199999999995
intelligence it's difficult

4336.8 --> 4341.6
like i i bet i'm better at cosmogeny

4339.52 --> 4342.96
than him but yeah

4341.6 --> 4344.8
what did you expect it's my

4342.96 --> 4347.84
specialization pretty much

4344.8 --> 4350.2390000000005
but other than that i don't know man no

4347.84 --> 4352.8
benjamin is really proficient dealing

4350.239 --> 4352.799999999999
with people

4353.12 --> 4359.44
he's i think he's better even at sizing

4356.48 --> 4359.839999999999
up what people what what people go

4359.44 --> 4361.919999999999
through

4359.84 --> 4364.0
in themselves and statistical average i

4361.92 --> 4365.6
think he's better at analyzing that than

4364.0 --> 4368.56
i am

4365.6 --> 4369.04
right so i might be smarter in certain

4368.56 --> 4372.320000000001
things

4369.04 --> 4374.239
but he's very smart in other things that

4372.32 --> 4376.799999999999
i am not so good at

4374.239 --> 4379.919999999999
right so don't try to put me on a

4376.8 --> 4379.92
pedestal above him

4382.84 --> 4385.84
please

4393.76 --> 4400.719
what game was it adam who did the

4398.08 --> 4402.8
presentation no that wasn't adam iron 26

4400.719 --> 4405.6
that was uh brian

4402.8 --> 4405.6
brian's logic

4406.48 --> 4413.759999999999
he was pure ego no he's not pure ego

4410.56 --> 4415.76
but he he does have an ego and he's

4413.76 --> 4418.8
dealing it with it in his own way

4415.76 --> 4420.159000000001
just like i do ego comes with

4418.8 --> 4424.8
intelligence right so

4420.159 --> 4428.159
hey pure ego that's kind of a sign

4424.8 --> 4430.719
the more intelligent the more ego it's a

4428.159 --> 4433.28
natural balance

4430.719 --> 4434.2390000000005
that's why the really really [ __ ]

4433.28 --> 4437.36
brilliant people

4434.239 --> 4440.959999999999
scarily brilliant are often have like

4437.36 --> 4442.4
crazy personal habits are kind of like

4440.96 --> 4444.88
maniacal

4442.4 --> 4446.4
it's because they're smart it's the

4444.88 --> 4449.76
balancing out one

4446.4 --> 4452.4
can't sustain without the other this is

4449.76 --> 4454.4800000000005
what i found

4452.4 --> 4456.719
i don't think so are we i'm not our win

4454.48 --> 4456.718999999999
what

4462.48 --> 4466.799999999999
successful means nothing the mind is

4464.48 --> 4466.799999999999
power

4467.28 --> 4473.759999999999
thank you amanda i i do appreciate that

4471.44 --> 4474.799999999999
but on the other hand i look owen

4473.76 --> 4477.92
benjamin is

4474.8 --> 4482.56
really good for the guys

4477.92 --> 4486.8
and i i really enjoy that

4482.56 --> 4490.400000000001
right and he's also like

4486.8 --> 4493.52
he helps educate men

4490.4 --> 4496.639999999999
like to point out the things

4493.52 --> 4497.4400000000005
that men typically do inside themselves

4496.64 --> 4500.400000000001
and then

4497.44 --> 4501.36
basically tells him them like this is

4500.4 --> 4503.839999999999
bad

4501.36 --> 4506.08
that is good this is the best way to

4503.84 --> 4509.52
look at is it just a lot of good advice

4506.08 --> 4510.08
on how to be a man and that might have

4509.52 --> 4512.56
eluded

4510.08 --> 4512.5599999999995
you a little

4514.48 --> 4518.879999999999
like on a very personal scale and

4516.719 --> 4521.92
sometimes he exaggerates it

4518.88 --> 4522.400000000001
a lot for a comedic effect so yeah he is

4521.92 --> 4526.159
kind of

4522.4 --> 4529.12
balancing with comedy like that

4526.159 --> 4529.759999999999
but yeah i've picked up a lot of good

4529.12 --> 4538.719
advice

4529.76 --> 4543.84
from him just subtle advice but maybe

4538.719 --> 4543.84
yeah yeah it's not for you

4548.88 --> 4552.0
could someone explain to me what

4550.8 --> 4554.159000000001
happened well

4552.0 --> 4555.84
what happened i don't know what you're

4554.159 --> 4557.199
talking about you're more deeper than

4555.84 --> 4560.4800000000005
the owen

4557.199 --> 4564.4
okay okay thank you

4560.48 --> 4564.4
i guess i'm more of a special boy than

4564.84 --> 4567.84
him

4569.44 --> 4573.28
but yeah i appreciate the sentiment

4574.88 --> 4579.12
but i don't feel better than him though

4577.199 --> 4582.799999999999
sometimes i feel like i'm smarter

4579.12 --> 4588.48
perhaps but i don't feel better than him

4582.8 --> 4588.4800000000005
you know and hey self-management is also

4588.719 --> 4592.159
successful self-management is also a

4590.96 --> 4595.6
sign of intelligence

4592.159 --> 4597.92
and although i am very much working on

4595.6 --> 4600.64
it and have come very far

4597.92 --> 4600.64
so as he

4600.96 --> 4609.28
and with a lot more forte a lot more

4604.239 --> 4611.44
actual engagement more physical action

4609.28 --> 4613.28
i'm still kind of stuck into being a

4611.44 --> 4616.879999999999
theorist doing a lot of things in my

4613.28 --> 4623.84
mind and i've become very good at that

4616.88 --> 4623.84
it's still different though

4625.76 --> 4630.719
right clutch bear yeah i think he helped

4629.52 --> 4633.120000000001
a lot of people

4630.719 --> 4635.04
just anchor themselves in a world where

4633.12 --> 4638.64
men constantly get

4635.04 --> 4642.239
barraged and berated

4638.64 --> 4643.92
over their manliness by society and

4642.239 --> 4651.839999999999
squirters and

4643.92 --> 4651.84
soy boys and communists

4662.84 --> 4665.84
foreign

4666.719 --> 4673.679
he's harmed a lot of people

4670.159 --> 4676.08
really that's that's a

4673.679 --> 4678.96
that's a big word to use right there

4676.08 --> 4682.0
like harm them

4678.96 --> 4683.28
and okay well amanda young i'll go i

4682.0 --> 4686.48
agree with that

4683.28 --> 4693.84
i am definitely a different person than

4686.48 --> 4693.839999999999
owen benjamin

4704.84 --> 4707.84
so

4717.76 --> 4724.08
all right okay well we can drop talking

4720.719 --> 4726.08
about him but hey you brought it up

4724.08 --> 4727.84
i think or did i bring it up i don't

4726.08 --> 4728.719
know yeah somebody in there brought it

4727.84 --> 4730.88
up

4728.719 --> 4733.6
we got bears you know we got bears in

4730.88 --> 4735.679
this chat so

4733.6 --> 4739.679
i will address owen benjamin every now

4735.679 --> 4739.679
and then because i do follow him

4741.6 --> 4748.400000000001
right and yeah he's attacked

4744.8 --> 4749.360000000001
people and then call them a grabbler and

4748.4 --> 4751.599999999999
all that

4749.36 --> 4754.0
but that's also part of his comedy it's

4751.6 --> 4757.04
like conspiracy comedy

4754.0 --> 4757.36
it's very real but the way he explains

4757.04 --> 4760.48
it

4757.36 --> 4763.92
is partially comedic

4760.48 --> 4765.199
and like front line like looking up

4763.92 --> 4767.92
borders type of

4765.199 --> 4769.36
comic your comedy how do you call that

4767.92 --> 4777.84
on the edge comedy

4769.36 --> 4777.839999999999
so it yeah

4778.0 --> 4785.04
bears like furries no not like furries

4781.76 --> 4788.56
bears in as in spiritual

4785.04 --> 4788.88
this spirit animal bear and how bears

4788.56 --> 4791.84
are

4788.88 --> 4793.76
out there how they typically respond

4791.84 --> 4794.719
socially that's what it's kind of based

4793.76 --> 4798.2390000000005
on it's not

4794.719 --> 4802.64
based on furries or

4798.239 --> 4806.959999999999
fat gay people fat gay men with beards

4802.64 --> 4806.96
that's not what it's based on right

4809.28 --> 4819.84
not paganism or druid come on why are

4812.32 --> 4819.84
you squirting them over this

4825.12 --> 4828.88
it's just the spirit of a bear it's not

4828.08 --> 4832.0
some freaking

4828.88 --> 4835.4400000000005
ritual or religion it's

4832.0 --> 4839.199
just the bear

4835.44 --> 4847.839999999999
as in the animal and how they're like

4839.199 --> 4847.839999999999
the spirit of it

4858.84 --> 4861.84
um

4866.719 --> 4875.12
all right we're pointing something out

4868.08 --> 4877.12
well so am i

4875.12 --> 4889.84
look if you don't like him that's fine

4877.12 --> 4889.84
don't don't watch him then

4892.88 --> 4899.52
oh okay luna lunawolf704

4896.48 --> 4903.839999999999
glad you enjoyed the show

4899.52 --> 4903.84
thanks for popping by

4915.199 --> 4919.199
you don't watch it but you can't talk

4917.679 --> 4922.4
about it

4919.199 --> 4924.96
well you already just pointed out the

4922.4 --> 4926.879999999999
issue there

4924.96 --> 4928.4
because yeah from what you've said it

4926.88 --> 4930.56
just sounds like superficial

4928.4 --> 4932.239
interpretation which means you don't get

4930.56 --> 4935.52
it

4932.239 --> 4938.159
but that's fine like

4935.52 --> 4940.320000000001
that's its own subject if you'd actually

4938.159 --> 4943.92
had followed owen benjamin for

4940.32 --> 4946.08
years like i have then you know that

4943.92 --> 4948.8
then you know how it works there's like

4946.08 --> 4951.36
a puzzle to the whole thing

4948.8 --> 4953.6
i want you until you get it yeah you're

4951.36 --> 4956.639
going to have all these issues with it

4953.6 --> 4958.96
until you get it until you get him

4956.639 --> 4962.159000000001
or you don't get him and then it's going

4958.96 --> 4962.159
to be like that forever

4965.76 --> 4973.84
you had followed him for years so what's

4968.0 --> 4973.84
the issue then

4979.6 --> 4982.88
you don't understand spiritual but it's

4982.239 --> 4985.5199999999995
it's not

4982.88 --> 4988.08
spiritual bears for crying out loud

4985.52 --> 4991.280000000001
secret asian man

4988.08 --> 4994.48
i already explained it it's not

4991.28 --> 4997.599999999999
some thing it's the spirit of

4994.48 --> 5000.718999999999
an idea of right

4997.6 --> 5004.56
social things attitudes

5000.719 --> 5007.199
energy levels the spirit of a bear

5004.56 --> 5009.04
the bear the animal out there how it is

5007.199 --> 5015.04
how it interacts

5009.04 --> 5018.8
a bear not a spiritual animal

5015.04 --> 5018.8
stop mixing that [ __ ] up

5023.92 --> 5033.52
you don't know the term squirting

5029.28 --> 5033.5199999999995
oh you don't want to know it's basically

5033.679 --> 5038.0
well there's a lot of what is it the

5036.48 --> 5043.839999999999
mountain bear videos

5038.0 --> 5043.84
that describe exactly what that is

5052.0 --> 5056.48
why would i want to talk about that

5055.32 --> 5071.12
terror306

5056.48 --> 5074.4
what the [ __ ]

5071.12 --> 5076.239
okay hello super x9

5074.4 --> 5078.879999999999
new to flatter i've been trying to

5076.239 --> 5081.839999999999
formalize the phenomena

5078.88 --> 5085.28
i encounter by using mathematics doesn't

5081.84 --> 5088.56
seem to fit yeah no [ __ ]

5085.28 --> 5092.639
mathematics don't prove reality

5088.56 --> 5098.639
it's just a tool to size

5092.639 --> 5101.12
and size up and analyze things

5098.639 --> 5101.84
so yeah you have to figure out first

5101.12 --> 5103.84
what are you

5101.84 --> 5106.0
actually doing with the math what are

5103.84 --> 5108.2390000000005
you presuming

5106.0 --> 5109.44
as a vantage point within the

5108.239 --> 5113.839999999999
mathematics

5109.44 --> 5113.839999999999
right what are you doing with it

5131.44 --> 5144.159
altera 306 look i have talked all

5141.12 --> 5145.84
i have talked about it before i

5144.159 --> 5155.839999999999
i really don't want to get into that

5145.84 --> 5155.84
right now just not the right time

5159.679 --> 5169.84
great it's getting loud

5175.57 --> 5178.7
[Music]

5180.84 --> 5183.84
uh

5198.0 --> 5202.159
all right but anyway i could keep it

5200.239 --> 5204.0
short the whole squirting thing is

5202.159 --> 5207.04
basically about

5204.0 --> 5207.04
it relates to

5207.12 --> 5212.08
a advisory narrative that owen benjamin

5210.56 --> 5213.76
holds on to

5212.08 --> 5215.6
and it's a good one and that is

5213.76 --> 5218.719
basically yeah

5215.6 --> 5220.400000000001
porn is bad and what do you do when you

5218.719 --> 5223.52
watch porn well

5220.4 --> 5225.839999999999
you squirt right so yeah it is kind of

5223.52 --> 5228.400000000001
disgusting like that

5225.84 --> 5230.159000000001
but if you just say squirt then it can

5228.4 --> 5233.599999999999
mean

5230.159 --> 5236.08
it's more like about the spirit of it

5233.6 --> 5237.280000000001
that attitude quick release and then

5236.08 --> 5240.0
just weakness

5237.28 --> 5241.679
and all kinds of side effects especially

5240.0 --> 5243.92
on the long run

5241.679 --> 5245.12
that's what it more is about than the

5243.92 --> 5247.52
actual action

5245.12 --> 5249.679
so i don't like to emphasize constantly

5247.52 --> 5251.52
like yeah what is that literally yeah

5249.679 --> 5255.1990000000005
that's not what i'm talking about

5251.52 --> 5259.1990000000005
so people can squirt in chat

5255.199 --> 5263.839999999999
or yeah and then they're not

5259.199 --> 5266.159
literally doing that it's just that

5263.84 --> 5267.84
it's lighting like they're doing it and

5266.159 --> 5268.4
that's why mountain bear has plenty of

5267.84 --> 5270.32
videos

5268.4 --> 5272.48
basically like oh god i'm squirting

5270.32 --> 5273.759999999999
again getting really upset about

5272.48 --> 5276.799999999999
something and then ah

5273.76 --> 5278.88
squirting again yeah that it's a joke

5276.8 --> 5281.84
it's part of the owen benjamin joke

5278.88 --> 5281.84
legacy

5289.12 --> 5295.84
son of might buzz what the [ __ ]

5296.719 --> 5303.28
oh well too bad then secret asian man if

5301.199 --> 5305.12
you don't like it

5303.28 --> 5309.84
sorry to say but if you don't like it

5305.12 --> 5309.84
you can [ __ ] off

5310.719 --> 5314.2390000000005
it's not a buzzword of that category

5313.84 --> 5317.92
okay

5314.239 --> 5321.44
he hates that he freaking hates

5317.92 --> 5324.159
that yeah

5321.44 --> 5324.48
and i'm not exactly a fan myself so to

5324.159 --> 5327.92
just

5324.48 --> 5329.12
associate that and then oh dehumanizing

5327.92 --> 5332.159
other people

5329.12 --> 5333.599999999999
no they're dehumanizing themselves

5332.159 --> 5335.36
when you call them a squirter you're

5333.6 --> 5337.84
just pointing out what they're doing to

5335.36 --> 5337.839999999999
themselves

5337.92 --> 5350.4800000000005
so just drop the [ __ ] attitude i'm

5340.239 --> 5352.159
getting really pissed off with you now

5350.48 --> 5353.5199999999995
hates it yet talks of a daily yeah

5352.159 --> 5354.0
that's called complaining and it's

5353.52 --> 5357.6
called

5354.0 --> 5361.199
being a subject that requires attention

5357.6 --> 5365.84
and making fun of that's what that means

5361.199 --> 5365.839999999999
he's a comedian

5371.199 --> 5379.839999999999
yeah secret agent yes exactly what

5373.199 --> 5379.839999999999
you're doing right now

5382.11 --> 5385.28
[Music]

5386.96 --> 5394.159
okay secretary goodbye secret asian man

5392.159 --> 5395.44
i'm revoking your wrench you're acting

5394.159 --> 5398.32
like a piece of [ __ ]

5395.44 --> 5398.32
and sick of it

5401.12 --> 5406.239
don't straw man me okay i already

5404.0 --> 5409.28
explained that [ __ ] thing with the

5406.239 --> 5411.12
spirit of bears

5409.28 --> 5412.5599999999995
and you're putting this false dichotomy

5411.12 --> 5415.599999999999
right in front of my eyes

5412.56 --> 5416.2390000000005
again so you're being a dick you're

5415.6 --> 5418.08
squirting

5416.239 --> 5419.5199999999995
you're literally squirting now and i'll

5418.08 --> 5421.84
have none of that

5419.52 --> 5421.84
right

5435.04 --> 5441.32
if you don't like him fine

5438.239 --> 5445.28
don't watch him anymore don't get all

5441.32 --> 5449.84
sjw [ __ ] about him in my freaking chat

5445.28 --> 5449.84
okay not tolerating that

5450.4 --> 5454.719
she can't handle the bears and own

5452.96 --> 5456.719
benjamin and how he does things just

5454.719 --> 5459.12
step away

5456.719 --> 5459.92
go to another hangout where they don't

5459.12 --> 5461.679
like him

5459.92 --> 5463.679
where it's okay to complain about how

5461.679 --> 5466.96
bad he bad man

5463.679 --> 5469.28
he is okay go to the squirt hangouts and

5466.96 --> 5476.8
just hang over there don't don't do that

5469.28 --> 5484.46
here all right

5476.8 --> 5484.46
[Music]

5488.84 --> 5497.4400000000005
um

5491.12 --> 5497.44
yeah last chance next time you're banned

5497.52 --> 5500.639
i'll have none of this i don't give a

5499.76 --> 5504.08
[ __ ]

5500.639 --> 5506.08
i'll have none of this i don't care how

5504.08 --> 5508.5599999999995
long i know you i don't care how smart

5506.08 --> 5512.32
you can be in chat sometimes

5508.56 --> 5516.96
you will comply do you understand

5512.32 --> 5519.84
you will comply or you will get kicked

5516.96 --> 5519.84
last chance

5530.96 --> 5549.58
take a break for five minutes

5546.49 --> 5549.58
[Music]

5556.96 --> 5563.84
did you answer me okay

5561.6 --> 5566.0
is that do you always do that put down a

5563.84 --> 5568.32
question and then immediately go away so

5566.0 --> 5575.84
you don't hear me answering it

5568.32 --> 5575.84
it's not very tactical of you

5575.92 --> 5583.1990000000005
does f is ma still apply no it doesn't

5579.28 --> 5583.199
it never applied it's pseudoscience

5584.639 --> 5589.84
mass is not a thing

5596.08 --> 5600.159
force is mass times acceleration

5600.639 --> 5607.1990000000005
that's yeah that's based in still a

5603.52 --> 5607.1990000000005
newtonian mechanic set up

5614.88 --> 5619.84
oh okay that's fine talking about which

5618.48 --> 5624.0
i'm gonna take a

5619.84 --> 5624.0
two minute break myself i'll be right

5628.84 --> 5631.84
back

5642.84 --> 5645.84
uh

5717.36 --> 5721.199
yeah monk patrol that's called

5726.84 --> 5729.84
psychosomatics

5753.84 --> 5759.4400000000005
that's funny that you should say that

5756.159 --> 5759.44
iron 26 because

5759.84 --> 5771.84
well not really gonna

5763.119 --> 5771.839999999999
do that when i was gonna stretch a bit

5773.12 --> 5776.29
[Music]

5784.48 --> 5799.839999999999
nope not gonna happen

5805.36 --> 5813.839999999999
will billiams all right

5838.84 --> 5841.84
um

5843.36 --> 5848.799999999999
right so super x9 do you got any

5846.48 --> 5852.879999999999
specifics you want me to address

5848.8 --> 5856.0
you said when you

5852.88 --> 5860.159000000001
try to apply math to a model

5856.0 --> 5860.159
i guess it didn't work out so

5860.8 --> 5869.84
can you be more specific

5863.84 --> 5869.84
what did you do

5908.84 --> 5912.719
hmm

5910.239 --> 5915.839999999999
has anybody by the way seen dank i

5912.719 --> 5918.88
haven't heard from tank in a while

5915.84 --> 5918.88
or [ __ ] use

5920.159 --> 5925.839999999999
and i hope he's doing all right

5956.56 --> 5958.88
what

5959.84 --> 5963.1990000000005
how long does it take to make six

5962.56 --> 5966.96
million

5963.199 --> 5970.159
batches of cookies holy [ __ ]

5966.96 --> 5970.159
that's a lot of cookies

5974.0 --> 5981.84
iron 26

5985.84 --> 5990.719
he answered his own question did i who

5992.84 --> 5995.84
did

6029.36 --> 6032.639
seems to have just completely dropped

6031.04 --> 6037.84
off the scene

6032.639 --> 6037.84
so either he gave up on internet

6038.719 --> 6043.679
and got a life out there or well i hope

6042.32 --> 6047.04
it's that

6043.679 --> 6047.6
i don't like to think that you might

6047.04 --> 6050.639
have

6047.6 --> 6054.0
gotten into some kind of

6050.639 --> 6056.08
health issue or something but yeah it's

6054.0 --> 6060.159
been a long time since obermuco

6056.08 --> 6061.36
came by not as long with dank though but

6060.159 --> 6064.239
still it's been like

6061.36 --> 6079.839999999999
a month at least since i last seen him

6064.239 --> 6079.839999999999
hit a a chat anywhere

6097.36 --> 6101.599999999999
you yelled at him and took his wrench

6099.679 --> 6104.8
doubt he will be back

6101.6 --> 6107.360000000001
well that would be sad i did kind of

6104.8 --> 6110.639
address that

6107.36 --> 6113.199
but i don't know it's not just like

6110.639 --> 6116.08
obermuco was active in other places too

6113.199 --> 6116.08
and now he's just

6118.84 --> 6121.84
nowhere

6139.52 --> 6142.080000000001
okay

6143.119 --> 6146.96
you try to measure the height of a

6145.52 --> 6149.119000000001
distant object

6146.96 --> 6151.52
only knowing my relative position to

6149.119 --> 6154.28
where you were both

6151.52 --> 6155.4400000000005
okay all right that's kind of like a

6154.28 --> 6158.719
triangulation

6155.44 --> 6162.799999999999
and with sight and all that all that

6158.719 --> 6164.4
but yeah triangulation like that

6162.8 --> 6166.159000000001
in visuals it's kind of difficult

6164.4 --> 6168.96
because it doesn't really account for

6166.159 --> 6172.0
the optical slant effect

6168.96 --> 6175.84
right it can account somewhat for percep

6172.0 --> 6178.8
perspective size changes due to distance

6175.84 --> 6178.8
to the observer

6179.28 --> 6182.719
but yeah things can still be influenced

6181.6 --> 6188.08
by mirages

6182.719 --> 6188.08
and all that if it's far away enough

6189.119 --> 6196.5599999999995
and yeah that does not really work out

6192.719 --> 6196.56
with the triangulation process

6199.119 --> 6205.839999999999
because now there's a unique visual

6201.36 --> 6205.839999999999
effect overlaying that

6223.52 --> 6229.6
air refraction because

6226.719 --> 6229.92
relative short distance what does that

6229.6 --> 6232.0
mean

6229.92 --> 6246.2390000000005
relative short distances what are you

6232.0 --> 6249.28
calling a short distance here

6246.239 --> 6251.919999999999
yeah brandon yeah it might have been

6249.28 --> 6252.5599999999995
about the wrench it's just that remember

6251.92 --> 6255.84
he did

6252.56 --> 6259.6
time out high profile people

6255.84 --> 6259.6
that's just a big no-no

6259.679 --> 6262.88
i still remember why i took his french

6261.679 --> 6266.0
away

6262.88 --> 6267.84
and got pissed off now i i'm assuming it

6266.0 --> 6269.6
was just an honest mistake and i might

6267.84 --> 6271.76
have overreacted a little in a moment

6269.6 --> 6271.76
but

6273.28 --> 6280.639
what happened happened i did

6277.119 --> 6284.08
afterward apologize about it about

6280.639 --> 6284.08
the slight overreaction

6284.159 --> 6289.839999999999
but yeah nobody's really heard of our

6286.239 --> 6289.839999999999
moccal since so

6297.36 --> 6302.159
it was probably two kilometers away but

6300.0 --> 6317.84
comparing it with the diameter

6302.159 --> 6317.839999999999
of earth what why would you do that

6343.119 --> 6345.839999999999
of the plane

6348.239 --> 6359.839999999999
the diameter of the plane what this is

6351.76 --> 6359.84
getting a little confusing now

6396.48 --> 6401.599999999999
okay so am i understanding correctly

6399.04 --> 6404.56
that you did some a triangulation with

6401.6 --> 6407.1990000000005
something that was two kilometers away

6404.56 --> 6408.080000000001
you calculated it and then it turned out

6407.199 --> 6410.879999999999
to be notch

6408.08 --> 6411.6
slightly down assuming you're on a flat

6410.88 --> 6414.639
plane

6411.6 --> 6416.8
right and that's where oh is that

6414.639 --> 6419.679
because of drop from earth curve

6416.8 --> 6421.92
is that it is that the assumption that

6419.679 --> 6424.56
you're basically going by because

6421.92 --> 6426.32
i already explained because of optical

6424.56 --> 6429.119000000001
effects

6426.32 --> 6430.799999999999
there's an optical slant effect at some

6429.119 --> 6435.04
point

6430.8 --> 6436.719
there's going to be an apparent nudge

6435.04 --> 6438.96
that you're going to see into the

6436.719 --> 6440.719
distance

6438.96 --> 6442.0
and that's going to cause bottom-up

6440.719 --> 6444.8
concealment of

6442.0 --> 6445.199
things in relation to the horizon and

6444.8 --> 6448.400000000001
might

6445.199 --> 6450.879999999999
also displace them visually in relation

6448.4 --> 6454.0
to the horizon

6450.88 --> 6456.639
right that is not really accounted for

6454.0 --> 6459.199
in standard triangulation

6456.639 --> 6460.88
and that's also the reason why land

6459.199 --> 6464.879999999999
surveyors

6460.88 --> 6467.6
don't do don't rely on super distant

6464.88 --> 6468.32
sites line of sights they do it on a

6467.6 --> 6470.88
relatively

6468.32 --> 6472.159
short distance because then you not

6470.88 --> 6476.639
subjected to the

6472.159 --> 6476.638999999999
optical slant apparent deviation

6479.44 --> 6481.759999999999
right

6483.28 --> 6489.159
because visuals over vast distance

6486.32 --> 6490.719
visual influences get in the way of

6489.159 --> 6493.839999999999
triangulation

6490.719 --> 6497.28
it's part of the problem triangulation

6493.84 --> 6502.56
is a geometric process it's mathematical

6497.28 --> 6506.8
it doesn't abide by visual effects

6502.56 --> 6509.280000000001
it doesn't account for that right

6506.8 --> 6510.08
and yeah when you see things especially

6509.28 --> 6512.719
looking in

6510.08 --> 6513.44
at a vast distance your it's gone your

6512.719 --> 6515.84
sight

6513.44 --> 6518.96
is going to be subjected by visual

6515.84 --> 6518.96
displacing effects

6519.44 --> 6523.119
so yeah i'm not surprised oh you did the

6521.28 --> 6524.88
calculation it turns out to be

6523.119 --> 6527.119
slightly displaced downward well

6524.88 --> 6530.0
surprise surprise

6527.119 --> 6530.0
that's what happens

6538.8 --> 6541.04
do

6542.0 --> 6545.28
look the visual displacement effects are

6544.719 --> 6547.679
yeah

6545.28 --> 6549.679
they're based on the the situation in

6547.679 --> 6550.96
the realm and the dynamic system the

6549.679 --> 6552.2390000000005
amount of moist in the air the

6550.96 --> 6555.52
temperature all that

6552.239 --> 6558.718999999999
yes yes it's very tough

6555.52 --> 6561.52
sight to get extremely accurate is

6558.719 --> 6563.199
very very tough because there's so many

6561.52 --> 6566.56
influences

6563.199 --> 6570.08
right geometry doesn't deal with that

6566.56 --> 6573.119000000001
geometry is just basic

6570.08 --> 6574.719
straight lines that's what it's really

6573.119 --> 6578.32
about

6574.719 --> 6582.159
yeah to apply

6578.32 --> 6585.199
optics based complex details

6582.159 --> 6586.719
is very difficult it really marks up the

6585.199 --> 6590.48
geometric process

6586.719 --> 6590.4800000000005
the triangulation process

6590.719 --> 6593.76
talk about looping

6595.36 --> 6598.5599999999995
what about it menu

6601.679 --> 6605.28
oh clutch where are you going yeah

6604.08 --> 6606.8
thanks clutch bear for

6605.28 --> 6611.84
for coming by it's been good to have you

6606.8 --> 6611.84
in chat please do come by again

6612.56 --> 6625.84
and you have a good holiday too

6627.36 --> 6631.36
some conversations might be easier if

6629.28 --> 6634.719
both sides were talking instead of one

6631.36 --> 6638.4
talking and one typing small bits

6634.719 --> 6641.599
it could be but unfortunately that's not

6638.4 --> 6641.598999999999
the setup for the show

6647.599 --> 6654.32
but yeah to have good typing skills

6650.96 --> 6654.8
will help you to participate in this

6654.32 --> 6658.88
show

6654.8 --> 6659.360000000001
in chat but i think i'm addressing the

6658.88 --> 6663.36
chat

6659.36 --> 6667.839999999999
well enough so far

6663.36 --> 6667.839999999999
and the chat has been pretty interesting

6668.48 --> 6681.839999999999
some good ideas and questions and

6670.32 --> 6681.84
remarks and all that

6683.92 --> 6688.159
all right and hey because of this setup

6686.639 --> 6689.1990000000005
i've explained this many times in the

6688.159 --> 6691.36
past

6689.199 --> 6692.638999999999
because of this setup because it's just

6691.36 --> 6695.5199999999995
me talking and i

6692.639 --> 6696.56
literally do not have to be afraid ever

6695.52 --> 6699.679
during this setup

6696.56 --> 6700.320000000001
that i'm gonna get rumpus right it does

6699.679 --> 6703.36
provide

6700.32 --> 6705.759999999999
like an extra bit of room

6703.36 --> 6706.48
where i can just without too much

6705.76 --> 6709.679
trouble

6706.48 --> 6712.4
focus much more sharply on details

6709.679 --> 6714.32
well when i'm basically engaging with

6712.4 --> 6716.08
other people i constantly have to

6714.32 --> 6718.96
suppress this

6716.08 --> 6721.44
because other people are talking too and

6718.96 --> 6725.36
it's more strenuous that way

6721.44 --> 6727.759999999999
can be depends um i don't know how much

6725.36 --> 6728.639
everybody's intuition is okay with me

6727.76 --> 6730.400000000001
talking

6728.639 --> 6737.52
sometimes they just don't want me to

6730.4 --> 6739.36
talk even though they can explain why

6737.52 --> 6741.84
but yeah i don't have that issue here on

6739.36 --> 6741.839999999999
my show

6742.96 --> 6746.159
on the other hand it can also result

6745.44 --> 6749.199
into me

6746.159 --> 6750.4
having very long pauses where i don't

6749.199 --> 6753.44
really know what to say

6750.4 --> 6755.5199999999995
that's kind of the downside of it

6753.44 --> 6756.879999999999
but hey when the chat is very fluent and

6755.52 --> 6760.2390000000005
people have a lot of input

6756.88 --> 6762.56
and feedback it works great

6760.239 --> 6765.839999999999
just like yesterday's show was great it

6762.56 --> 6765.84
was a really good one

6765.92 --> 6770.08
and i think that today's show is pretty

6767.84 --> 6773.1990000000005
pretty good as well it's like a

6770.08 --> 6775.84
a two-hour show now

6773.199 --> 6776.879999999999
just a bonus hour because it's working

6775.84 --> 6780.56
so well

6776.88 --> 6780.56
because there are so many people in chat

6785.599 --> 6789.84
and because i i wanted to give amanda

6788.0 --> 6792.0
young a bonus hour for her

6789.84 --> 6792.96
outstanding support in the last two days

6792.0 --> 6807.84
i really

6792.96 --> 6807.84
really appreciate it

6809.92 --> 6815.1990000000005
a formal description well super x9

6816.56 --> 6820.080000000001
yeah there could be there may be the

6819.36 --> 6822.5599999999995
problem is

6820.08 --> 6823.599
it's really so complex so many influence

6822.56 --> 6826.76
so

6823.599 --> 6830.56
specific types of conditions and

6826.76 --> 6833.599
variations in those conditions per

6830.56 --> 6834.0
site per region it literally is

6833.599 --> 6836.08
different

6834.0 --> 6837.04
everywhere the variables are all over

6836.08 --> 6839.04
the place

6837.04 --> 6840.96
right it's so you can't really

6839.04 --> 6842.32
standardize it as much it's just not

6840.96 --> 6844.88
doable

6842.32 --> 6845.92
it really is and people have tried okay

6844.88 --> 6848.0
uh

6845.92 --> 6849.52
there's one channel it's his name again

6848.0 --> 6852.159
life is short

6849.52 --> 6852.56
he really focused on trying to do that

6852.159 --> 6856.5599999999995
like

6852.56 --> 6859.280000000001
very very detailed mechanically detailed

6856.56 --> 6861.360000000001
even including the math elaborate

6859.28 --> 6864.8
explanations as to how these

6861.36 --> 6867.5199999999995
atmospheric conditions cause

6864.8 --> 6869.119000000001
influences on sites so if you want to

6867.52 --> 6871.76
know more about that

6869.119 --> 6872.88
and you're all about math and techniques

6871.76 --> 6876.2390000000005
technical

6872.88 --> 6878.0
details i'd recommend you go to

6876.239 --> 6879.5199999999995
his channel and subscribe and check out

6878.0 --> 6882.56
some of his videos

6879.52 --> 6883.119000000001
so life is short just look it up on

6882.56 --> 6885.119000000001
youtube

6883.119 --> 6886.48
it's not a really big channel but he's

6885.119 --> 6890.4
really good

6886.48 --> 6892.32
technically it's very elaborate

6890.4 --> 6895.199
presentation so check it out

6892.32 --> 6895.199
i recommend it

6898.0 --> 6905.84
and so does nathan oakley by the way we

6901.04 --> 6905.84
we all kind of know him

6908.159 --> 6911.839999999999
but i don't think he's like a regularly

6910.719 --> 6914.719
engaged

6911.84 --> 6917.04
verbal debater though but he did a lot

6914.719 --> 6933.84
of research in this

6917.04 --> 6933.84
and shared it with us

6944.84 --> 6947.84
okay

6958.84 --> 6961.84
hmm

6989.119 --> 6993.839999999999
hmm i am getting really hungry by the

6991.599 --> 6993.84
way

7000.56 --> 7007.280000000001
my shoulders doing fine i think that

7003.84 --> 7009.679
if this trend continues i'll probably be

7007.28 --> 7010.32
my shoulder might be back tomorrow but

7009.679 --> 7013.679
be

7010.32 --> 7017.36
back to be back to normal

7013.679 --> 7019.36
in maybe a few days or a week

7017.36 --> 7020.48
but there is like improvement i'm very

7019.36 --> 7022.719
happy about it who

7020.48 --> 7024.159
are winning this personal ailments oh

7022.719 --> 7026.4
it's so important i know

7024.159 --> 7028.799999999999
everybody's interested in my personal

7026.4 --> 7031.598999999999
ailments everybody

7028.8 --> 7034.4800000000005
yeah that was sarcasm by the way but i'm

7031.599 --> 7034.4800000000005
just putting it down

7034.719 --> 7038.719
because it has influence on me and i'd

7036.8 --> 7039.92
like to inform you about things that

7038.719 --> 7045.84
have influence on me

7039.92 --> 7045.84
so right

7070.84 --> 7075.92
hmm

7073.599 --> 7078.4800000000005
what didn't happened did you get hurt

7075.92 --> 7080.96
not really

7078.48 --> 7080.959999999999
no it's

7083.679 --> 7089.36
it's like stress-based muscle

7087.36 --> 7090.719
cramp you could say or that's kind of

7089.36 --> 7092.719
yeah it's difficult it's just a

7090.719 --> 7094.08
condition that happens when you get when

7092.719 --> 7099.36
you stress yourself

7094.08 --> 7102.159
out then it can like start to

7099.36 --> 7103.679
seed within a certain tissue in your

7102.159 --> 7105.36
body

7103.679 --> 7107.119
and that also correlates with like

7105.36 --> 7110.639
spiritual things yet

7107.119 --> 7113.28
through germany medicine and then

7110.639 --> 7117.04
it can just start really nagging so it's

7113.28 --> 7119.199
like it's almost like there's just this

7117.04 --> 7120.159
inflammation i guess somewhere in

7119.199 --> 7122.96
between

7120.159 --> 7125.44
a bone and a muscle and it's constantly

7122.96 --> 7127.199
in the way

7125.44 --> 7129.44
it's like somebody's constantly poking

7127.199 --> 7131.919999999999
me and it's not going away

7129.44 --> 7133.5199999999995
it's like you can't massage this out you

7131.92 --> 7136.4
know sometimes i have

7133.52 --> 7137.84
just slight issues and muscles like and

7136.4 --> 7139.839999999999
i can massage it

7137.84 --> 7141.92
and then it goes away well this one's

7139.84 --> 7143.599
not going away so it's like an

7141.92 --> 7146.96
inflammation

7143.599 --> 7149.1990000000005
and it is prob or don't get scared but

7146.96 --> 7151.04
it might actually be even like temporary

7149.199 --> 7153.5199999999995
cancer tissue

7151.04 --> 7156.08
german new medicine related cancer is

7153.52 --> 7159.679
actually normal

7156.08 --> 7159.679
right don't be afraid

7160.159 --> 7164.4
right unless i'm get all afraid like oh

7162.8 --> 7166.84
my god i might have

7164.4 --> 7169.44
something all the medication i need

7166.84 --> 7172.719
anti-anxiety and pain medication

7169.44 --> 7174.799999999999
and yeah then you might [ __ ] it up and

7172.719 --> 7176.159
actually cause it to go out of control

7174.8 --> 7179.599
now it's just

7176.159 --> 7180.799999999999
a local thing a local physical metabolic

7179.599 --> 7183.599
issue

7180.8 --> 7185.679
that has to resolve itself that's why i

7183.599 --> 7186.2390000000005
don't take pain medication for this sort

7185.679 --> 7190.4
of thing

7186.239 --> 7192.638999999999
never i really am anti pain medication

7190.4 --> 7194.719
even when it's freaking

7192.639 --> 7197.36
jaw and teeth issues and all that i

7194.719 --> 7200.719
don't take it because it never helps

7197.36 --> 7203.28
on the long run it doesn't help

7200.719 --> 7204.639
it's only when things for some reason

7203.28 --> 7208.239
get to the point where it gets

7204.639 --> 7211.119
so bad that i'd literally just

7208.239 --> 7212.959999999999
not able to focus anymore on anything

7211.119 --> 7215.199
but even then it's just more likely i'll

7212.96 --> 7217.199
just say okay screw it i'm just going to

7215.199 --> 7219.36
sleep a lot now and then

7217.199 --> 7220.239
kind of work on it that way it's

7219.36 --> 7222.48
basically

7220.239 --> 7224.718999999999
indirectly what happened last time in

7222.48 --> 7227.759999999999
october when i got really sick

7224.719 --> 7231.84
for a week and didn't eat for a week

7227.76 --> 7233.679
i didn't take pain medication any

7231.84 --> 7234.96
that not that i would be able to keep it

7233.679 --> 7238.08
in back then

7234.96 --> 7241.199
but i don't i just don't i take

7238.08 --> 7254.159
the pain god provides

7241.199 --> 7255.759999999999
it's there for a reason

7254.159 --> 7257.5199999999995
sounds like what you get from work

7255.76 --> 7258.96
sometimes right well i think a lot of

7257.52 --> 7261.4400000000005
people get that sort of thing

7258.96 --> 7261.44
it's just

7262.4 --> 7265.92
it's normal it's kind of what happens it

7265.36 --> 7269.28
is

7265.92 --> 7272.4
also has to do with emotions

7269.28 --> 7275.119
and social issues

7272.4 --> 7275.92
social issues and emotional responses

7275.119 --> 7277.759999999999
impacts

7275.92 --> 7279.36
they literally in germinal medicine call

7277.76 --> 7282.719
it impacts

7279.36 --> 7285.28
right impact that's a terminology impact

7282.719 --> 7286.08
things that make impact on you then

7285.28 --> 7289.5199999999995
reflect

7286.08 --> 7293.44
on the physique in a very specific

7289.52 --> 7295.4400000000005
manner like there's literally a map

7293.44 --> 7297.44
like oh you have an issue here well

7295.44 --> 7300.239
that's gonna correlate to

7297.44 --> 7300.5599999999995
this specific setup and oh it's over

7300.239 --> 7304.799999999999
there

7300.56 --> 7308.2390000000005
that's yeah it's it's like astrology

7304.8 --> 7310.639
it's really insane or it's like tarot

7308.239 --> 7313.199
readings how i get it it just always

7310.639 --> 7315.1990000000005
works out it's crazy

7313.199 --> 7316.96
you can literally every time we get an

7315.199 --> 7320.159
issue i get an issue

7316.96 --> 7322.8
i can just read it off the chart

7320.159 --> 7323.679
and just see yeah that makes perfect

7322.8 --> 7326.400000000001
sense because that's

7323.679 --> 7327.679
exactly what i've been dealing with like

7326.4 --> 7329.44
the month before

7327.679 --> 7331.92
and it made a lot of impact and i

7329.44 --> 7334.0
finally got over it you get over it

7331.92 --> 7335.599
guess what there's going to be a

7334.0 --> 7337.679
physical manifestation

7335.599 --> 7339.360000000001
usually leading to some kind of pain

7337.679 --> 7340.96
lasting for a while

7339.36 --> 7342.799999999999
right that's what german new medicine

7340.96 --> 7346.4800000000005
teaches and it's crazy

7342.8 --> 7350.320000000001
how well it works crazy

7346.48 --> 7353.44
to realize how well it works and then

7350.32 --> 7356.719
mirror that to the freaking medical

7353.44 --> 7359.919999999999
mainstream approach of health it's

7356.719 --> 7362.08
it's a totally different world it took

7359.92 --> 7363.04
some time for me to get used to it like

7362.08 --> 7365.599
years it

7363.04 --> 7366.719
because i knew about it was just like no

7365.599 --> 7371.679
now that's

7366.719 --> 7375.199
too much too much well i got used to it

7371.679 --> 7378.32
yeah it works it works really well

7375.199 --> 7381.839999999999
so i will utilize it

7378.32 --> 7381.84
