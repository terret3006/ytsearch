[Music]

40.2 --> 48.1
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

44.05 --> 53.949999999999996
early-bird number 150 I'm your host

48.1 --> 55.96
Arwen and today is interesting day it's

53.95 --> 59.47
kind of sunny it is kind of windy though

55.96 --> 62.26
and for some reason there's a lot of

59.47 --> 65.95
chemtrails up and I'm really annoyed by

62.26 --> 73.36
that so yeah nice and sunny but also he

65.95 --> 76.3
had fresh and the trees are totally

73.36 --> 78.3
starting to blossom now they're like

76.3 --> 83.07
tomorrow is good they're gonna be full

78.3 --> 83.07
so yeah that's looking really beautiful

85.14 --> 91.33
alright so yeah I I totally missed out

89.38 --> 95.28999999999999
on some hangouts because I decided to

91.33 --> 101.67
start watching a new series that turned

95.29 --> 104.409
out to be creepy as hell Netflix and

101.67 --> 107.32000000000001
yeah because of that I missed a lot of

104.409 --> 113.05000000000001
hangouts that were going live but oh

107.32 --> 118.08999999999999
well I was particularly interested

113.05 --> 122.64999999999999
because yeah the psychological nature of

118.09 --> 128.59
it but it turned out to be pretty much

122.65 --> 131.95000000000002
as creepy as you can imagine it's series

128.59 --> 135.66
called the Alienist and I was thinking

131.95 --> 135.66
or itching like maybe this is a little

140.23 --> 146.29
in the theme of Cthulhu and all that

143.4 --> 150.04
Call of Cthulhu like but apparently it's

146.29 --> 154.23999999999998
just purely hit sort of historical about

150.04 --> 156.73
serial killers in some way and yeah it's

154.24 --> 161.14000000000001
done really well and it's just creepy as

156.73 --> 164.28
[ __ ] I caught myself on several times

161.14 --> 167.01
just like hiding behind my hands just

164.28 --> 174.37
yeah I do that it's kind of weird but

167.01 --> 175.92999999999998
man it was pretty heavy stuff and right

174.37 --> 178.96
so I don't have a lot of letters

175.93 --> 181.36
reporting to do although yeah hurry was

178.96 --> 185.4
doing like a flat earth show calendar

181.36 --> 189.72000000000003
that was pretty interesting and I

185.4 --> 194.86
requested he put me on the list as well

189.72 --> 196.72
right and so let's get to my guest

194.86 --> 198.61

221.59 --> 227.56
really early bird for you really early

225.1 --> 230.47
bird you know thanks for taking the

227.56 --> 233.92000000000002
effort of getting up this early just to

233.92 --> 242.01999999999998
pleasure cool so yeah we had a good long

238.27 --> 245.11
Skype but yet yesterday yeah it was

242.02 --> 248.59
interesting stuff and yeah it turns out

245.11 --> 250.15
we have this weird thing where we kind

248.59 --> 252.78
of tend to agree on pretty much

250.15 --> 252.78
everything

254.42 --> 262.28
that's weird but yeah there are still

257.299 --> 265.15
some things I want to get to understand

262.28 --> 270.65
a little bit better about your approach

265.15 --> 273.53
to the Bible and yeah to your personal

270.65 --> 275.41999999999996
religion is it okay if I call it your

273.53 --> 278.11999999999995
personal religion or is it how do you

275.42 --> 281.72
regard as a philosophy or a methodology

278.12 --> 284.78000000000003
or what does it you do it who are you

281.72 --> 286.85
like haha well I personally I personally

284.78 --> 289.78999999999996
don't call it a religion anymore as the

286.85 --> 291.89000000000004
father himself said to me I want you to

289.79 --> 293.78000000000003
leave all religion and follow me so I

291.89 --> 296.53999999999996
don't know I wouldn't call it a religion

293.78 --> 300.71
you probably could call it a philosophy

296.54 --> 303.91900000000004
or a way of life I guess am i coming

300.71 --> 308.93
across loud enough - uh yeah I think so

303.919 --> 310.57
I let me check okay yet jet is sorry

308.93 --> 313.31
what's your name again your full name

310.57 --> 315.59
Joshua Michael yeah Joshua is Joshua's

313.31 --> 322.16
coming through loud and clear everyone

315.59 --> 326.919
in chat anyway to me you're coming

322.16 --> 330.38000000000005
through loud and clear so okay so I just

326.919 --> 335.5
yeah cool sounds good alright thanks

330.38 --> 340.37
Karen yeah so base it so basically I

335.5 --> 342.44
used to call myself Hebrew and then it

340.37 --> 346.37
was Hebrew Israelite until I realized

342.44 --> 348.08
that they the black Hebrew Israelite

346.37 --> 351.59000000000003
movement was not something I wanted to

348.08 --> 354.38
be associated with and then I went to

351.59 --> 358.76
Israel as the father called it the

354.38 --> 359.93
Israelites there Israel of people from

358.76 --> 362.75
my perspective from my understanding

359.93 --> 365.90000000000003
from the Most High and then that became

362.75 --> 370.3
another kind of religion and so I

365.9 --> 373.53999999999996
finally finally I finally settled on

370.3 --> 376.37
kind of classifying myself as an Essene

373.54 --> 379.46000000000004
because an Essene is not a religion it's

376.37 --> 382.1
actually a way of life and the scene all

379.46 --> 385.40999999999997
the scenes sounds familiar

382.1 --> 387.81
where Steve reference to what that is

385.41 --> 389.1
where well why do you have to kind of go

387.81 --> 392.94
digging for it actually

389.1 --> 394.68
Yeshua he whom as I refer as I

392.94 --> 396.93
referenced that he who is wrongly called

394.68 --> 399.36
Jesus right right

396.93 --> 401.15000000000003
yes oh the classical era basically it's

399.36 --> 404.31
from the class yeah at the Essenes

401.15 --> 406.53
correct it's seen actually as the

404.31 --> 408.69
ancient word for the word that modernly

406.53 --> 411.29999999999995
today is used as Nazarene

408.69 --> 414.53
although the nazzer the Church of the

411.3 --> 417.11
Nazarene does not even really a so

414.53 --> 423.41999999999996
understand what the ancient Essenes

417.11 --> 426.33000000000004
bornus or Nazarene were okay the ancient

423.42 --> 429.93
as Nazarene Doris teens were actually

426.33 --> 432.87
plant-based eaters they believed in your

429.93 --> 437.01
not corrupting the body with wine and

432.87 --> 442.89
they believed in the loving of animals

437.01 --> 447.87
and the non eating of flesh to go into

442.89 --> 449.66999999999996
that a little bit in Scripture we're

447.87 --> 454.56
told you know don't eat anything with

449.67 --> 457.47
the blood they're in the Jewish people

454.56 --> 460.65
the Jewish leadership when are you want

457.47 --> 462.99
when I say Zionist Jews I'm talking

460.65 --> 464.94
about the leadership that's corrupt not

462.99 --> 467.52
the people themselves but the people

464.94 --> 470.79
that make the rules right if I can try

467.52 --> 474.51
to find that a little bit but the the

470.79 --> 477.06
zionist jews twisted scripture in that

474.51 --> 480.06
what they do then is they take an animal

477.06 --> 483.45
they drain the blood out of that animal

480.06 --> 487.23
and then they eat the flesh this is not

483.45 --> 489.71999999999997
at all what was what was meant by that

487.23 --> 492.45000000000005
in Hebrew in Hebrew when it says you

489.72 --> 493.8
shall not eat the blood any animal with

492.45 --> 496.77
a blood therein he's talking about the

493.8 --> 499.08
animal not just the blood we're told

496.77 --> 500.88
blood the life is in the blood and so it

499.08 --> 503.58
did with the Jewish leadership do this

500.88 --> 505.56
Oh we'll just we'll just drain the blood

503.58 --> 507.57
out and we'll still eat what okay so you

505.56 --> 509.31
think it's like a lawyer trick they're

507.57 --> 511.40999999999997
basically pulling correct that's exactly

509.31 --> 513.93
yeah well I mean what is there anything

511.41 --> 517.919
yeah because that does sound plausible

513.93 --> 519.539
very much so but is there any direct

517.919 --> 522.11
thing in the Bible that

519.539 --> 527.009
specifically no that's not the case you

522.11 --> 530.4590000000001
can eat and your flesh as well yes there

527.009 --> 533.759
is there's let me pull it up real quick

530.459 --> 537.0
actually this I think this weekend I'm

533.759 --> 539.61
gonna be doing a debate actually I hate

537.0 --> 543.029
the word debate myself I prefer the word

539.61 --> 545.25
discussion because a debate implies an

543.029 --> 546.6899999999999
argument versus two people coming

545.25 --> 548.16
together and trying to reason together

546.69 --> 553.6800000000001
which is what we're technically supposed

548.16 --> 555.36
to be doing but it's okay but I'm doing

553.68 --> 558.149
a debate on isn't it a sin to eat flesh

555.36 --> 561.589
I personally do believe it is a sin to

558.149 --> 565.11
eat flesh and I believe that actually

561.589 --> 568.98
science and the medical part of that end

565.11 --> 570.48
will concur it can bear that out and

568.98 --> 573.0600000000001
I'll explain that here a minute but let

570.48 --> 577.5
me pull this up if I can find it real

573.06 --> 580.7689999999999
quick okay I already got an opposing

577.5 --> 584.13
question then yeah I'm sure that's okay

580.769 --> 589.76
if you want to get to the scripture

584.13 --> 589.76
reference first and I'll wait out week

591.529 --> 601.749
where are you here oh there we go

598.59 --> 601.749
[Music]

605.42 --> 609.38
okay you know I'm gonna have to go to

607.34 --> 611.7800000000001
the Internet hold on one sec Arlen let

609.38 --> 616.55
me pull up a second page here I'm sorry

611.78 --> 618.47
I plan on having this at my fingertips

616.55 --> 619.9399999999999
although I probably should have but I

618.47 --> 625.88
should probably always have it mention

619.94 --> 629.0
your attempts I guess all right now for

625.88 --> 631.34
from my perspective the consumption of

629.0 --> 632.18
flesh and sacrifice are both tied

631.34 --> 635.63
hand-in-hand

632.18 --> 638.78
oh okay is that your personal opinion is

635.63 --> 643.15
that the part of the scripture it's no

638.78 --> 646.28
it's if when you read it and understand

643.15 --> 648.68
it's not my personal opinion my opinions

646.28 --> 650.4499999999999
as I have come to understand it from the

648.68 --> 653.2399999999999
most high at least from my perspective

650.45 --> 655.3100000000001
are irrelevant what matters is what the

653.24 --> 656.9
Most High said and what the most

655.31 --> 660.01
heightened meant that's what I care

656.9 --> 663.56
about not my opinion no debe sorry

660.01 --> 666.73
opinion was a colloquial in this case

663.56 --> 670.25
just saying what where you're at right

666.73 --> 673.5500000000001
eye and then whatever you ascribe that

670.25 --> 679.61
to to the Lord or your own intuition or

673.55 --> 681.91
whatever that's yeah that's correct I

679.61 --> 684.44
have to I have to define it because

681.91 --> 686.81
oftentimes for example Christians will

684.44 --> 691.1600000000001
say well what's an opinion what's not

686.81 --> 693.4
and to me all I ever care about now is

691.16 --> 695.8399999999999
the truth not my opinion and not beliefs

693.4 --> 697.01
but what I care about is what's true

695.84 --> 700.19
because that's the only thing that

697.01 --> 700.97
actually is based in fact in the eyes of

700.19 --> 704.0
the Most High

700.97 --> 707.09
alright that make sense yeah ok ok so

704.0 --> 712.25
here I have these here I have these

707.09 --> 714.02
verses okay the first one is that the

712.25 --> 717.41
father said I give you all seed bearing

714.02 --> 721.06
plants for food hold on which together

717.41 --> 724.1999999999999
name the scripture okay okay

721.06 --> 724.1999999999999
[Music]

726.899 --> 735.25
okay Genesis 1:29

729.85 --> 738.5790000000001
and 30 and Elohim said see I have given

735.25 --> 741.22
you every plant that yields seed which

738.579 --> 744.67
is on the face of the earth and every

741.22 --> 749.7090000000001
tree whose fruits yield seed

744.67 --> 751.389
okay to you for food and now here's

749.709 --> 754.449
where people get confused because you

751.389 --> 757.779
have to go back and learn how Hebrew how

754.449 --> 760.0889999999999
Hebrew is written to understand that

757.779 --> 762.31
this is one whole thought it is not a

760.089 --> 766.269
separate thought he's not all of a

762.31 --> 768.9399999999999
sudden changing and identifying the

766.269 --> 772.6
animals as food he says and to every

768.94 --> 775.3290000000001
beast of the earth and to every bird of

772.6 --> 778.3290000000001
the heavens and to every creeping

775.329 --> 783.9699999999999
creature on the earth in which there is

778.329 --> 787.209
life every green plant is for food so

783.97 --> 790.149
he's saying all of flesh all of the

787.209 --> 793.6899999999999
animals of flesh right okay

790.149 --> 795.339
now that word creeping thing I've had

793.69 --> 798.1600000000001
debates with people where they're all

795.339 --> 800.1700000000001
answer that's insects no it's not the

798.16 --> 802.7199999999999
word there isn't a flesh and the

800.17 --> 806.17
difference between an A and insect and

802.72 --> 807.9100000000001
an animal is the blood because insects

806.17 --> 810.9399999999999
don't have blood that has typical human

807.91 --> 813.91
and the most artistically correct it's

810.94 --> 817.3290000000001
creeping animal exactly and then it says

813.91 --> 820.329
and it came to me so so where I've had

817.329 --> 824.26
where I was raised as a Christian I was

820.329 --> 827.8889999999999
raised to read it if you go back to 29

824.26 --> 829.54
at when it changes to 30 I was raised as

827.889 --> 831.76
a Christian to believe Oh see he's

829.54 --> 835.12
saying and every beast we can hate food

831.76 --> 838.42
that's not how that reads he's speaking

835.12 --> 842.019
to not just humans he's speaking to all

838.42 --> 843.8499999999999
animals because at one time he spoke to

842.019 --> 847.2090000000001
all and he speaks to all animals I

843.85 --> 849.1
believe still the difference is we

847.209 --> 851.29
understand things differently all right

849.1 --> 854.0790000000001
okay so you're getting it from Genesis

851.29 --> 857.399
at least well that's one I have here I

854.079 --> 859.5699999999999
have a document where I have 50 verses

857.399 --> 863.23
okay so I will randomly

859.57 --> 867.07
through this genesis 9:4 but do not eat

863.23 --> 868.78
flesh with the life it's blood ok this

867.07 --> 870.7900000000001
is again where the juice hey oh look

868.78 --> 872.47
we're draining the blood out and we'll

870.79 --> 874.15
eat flesh put a problem with that and

872.47 --> 876.22
then they teach all of mankind you do

874.15 --> 879.4599999999999
that if you go back and you look at heap

876.22 --> 881.5600000000001
in the Old Testament the Israelites are

879.46 --> 883.3000000000001
coming out of Egypt they're out in the

881.56 --> 885.0699999999999
desert the father's given a manna and

883.3 --> 887.02
all of a sudden they go to the fog they

885.07 --> 890.9200000000001
go to the father and they say hey look

887.02 --> 893.29
we remember quail and and fish and all

890.92 --> 896.02
the stuff that we got in Egypt we want

893.29 --> 898.63
to eat that and the father says ok well

896.02 --> 901.09
I'll tell you what you can have your

898.63 --> 904.63
quail but but I'm gonna make it come out

901.09 --> 907.51
of every orifice in your body now I

904.63 --> 909.46
don't know I'm not a rocket scientist

907.51 --> 912.1
but that doesn't seem like a good thing

909.46 --> 914.35
to me in fact if you read on it says

912.1 --> 916.33
that he they vomited and it came out of

914.35 --> 918.34
their nose it was it was not a good

916.33 --> 921.37
thing the father was like no you should

918.34 --> 923.62
not be eating animals if you acted

921.37 --> 925.45
Genesis we were we were given the charge

923.62 --> 928.8100000000001
of taking under of the earth that's

925.45 --> 931.9000000000001
logical though for us if you have not

928.81 --> 935.4399999999999
eaten any kind of meat or anything in

931.9 --> 939.04
your at your childhood very yeah like

935.44 --> 941.23
not without any exception then if you

939.04 --> 943.39
add later in life start to try it out

941.23 --> 946.45
yeah your metabolism gonna get very

943.39 --> 948.85
confused it's solely unadapted to it it

946.45 --> 952.96
can still do it it'll never be as good

948.85 --> 956.65
to adapt to it though but I don't know

952.96 --> 959.98
as a child when I got like the firsts it

956.65 --> 962.92
goes of meat and all that I didn't have

959.98 --> 965.86
that response really so right I think

962.92 --> 969.66
well here's here's another I fix a few

965.86 --> 972.61
things about the thing is take it ok

969.66 --> 978.63
sorry no no I still had that question

972.61 --> 983.35
and that is I regard it a little less

978.63 --> 985.4399999999999
scriptural and more from a designer's

983.35 --> 988.5400000000001
perspective that's what I typically do

985.44 --> 990.97
when I try to approach the creator or

988.54 --> 992.9599999999999
try to figure out logos what is best

990.97 --> 994.73
what is most logical what's the best

992.96 --> 998.0
lucien for everything and how it is

994.73 --> 1003.76
designed and i think that humans and

998.0 --> 1006.6
also animals many of them just would

1003.76 --> 1010.29
prefer to eat vegetables and fruits

1006.6 --> 1013.69
because of their very tasty very good

1010.29 --> 1017.6999999999999
but that yeah sometimes cataclysms

1013.69 --> 1018.94
happen or droughts happen all that and

1017.7 --> 1021.58
yeah

1018.94 --> 1024.97
at a period it may be prolonged even

1021.58 --> 1027.31
certain animals and humans may just have

1024.97 --> 1031.03
nothing left to eat except for animals

1027.31 --> 1034.06
and then they can adapt to it and

1031.03 --> 1037.69
survive for a harsh period or like a

1034.06 --> 1040.99
super hard winter or a long drought and

1037.69 --> 1045.43
then eventually yea they some of them

1040.99 --> 1048.69
will survive and be able to win nature

1045.43 --> 1052.42
restores itself yeah get back to

1048.69 --> 1059.53
vegetables again have you read The Book

1052.42 --> 1061.8100000000002
of Enoch no not fully now okay I would I

1059.53 --> 1064.03
would highly recommend you do you take

1061.81 --> 1066.07
some time when you get some time and and

1064.03 --> 1067.66
read that book and here's why the Roman

1066.07 --> 1069.9399999999998
Catholic Church removed that book from

1067.66 --> 1072.43
Canada well yeah I know that I know that

1069.94 --> 1075.91
I know and I've had a lot of readings

1072.43 --> 1078.6100000000001
from the Book of Enoch from flatwater

1075.91 --> 1080.8300000000002
a while back in the beginning he brought

1078.61 --> 1083.7099999999998
out these videos where he would be

1080.83 --> 1086.8
reading it out so I did follow a lot of

1083.71 --> 1089.32
that I get yeah amazing what it says it

1086.8 --> 1094.06
says the fallen angels actually taught

1089.32 --> 1097.1499999999999
us to eat to eat meat and to cook it and

1094.06 --> 1102.01
to kill animals and eat them and in fact

1097.15 --> 1105.64
in one verse I don't use the word God

1102.01 --> 1108.78
anymore I think God the word g.od is

1105.64 --> 1110.5
actually a name of from what I was told

1108.78 --> 1113.28
by the Most High

1110.5 --> 1117.64
it's actually the name of the devil

1113.28 --> 1120.33
because in Hebrew we we have lost our

1117.64 --> 1123.42
understanding partially again because of

1120.33 --> 1126.79
the Roman Catholic Church and the

1123.42 --> 1129.3500000000001
Sanhedrin teaching us

1126.79 --> 1133.73
English is probably the most bastardized

1129.35 --> 1137.1799999999998
yeah language ever the scripture says we

1133.73 --> 1140.24
are snared by the words of our mouth as

1137.18 --> 1141.38
in our in the tongue we hold the power

1140.24 --> 1143.93
of life and death

1141.38 --> 1146.18
the problem is this if I don't

1143.93 --> 1148.88
understand the words that I'm saying I

1146.18 --> 1151.73
can very well be cursing myself let me

1148.88 --> 1153.3200000000002
give you an exact salute it's really

1151.73 --> 1153.83
funny that you're saying that I totally

1153.32 --> 1157.6599999999999
agree

1153.83 --> 1161.6599999999999
so we're so blessing to solve this or go

1157.66 --> 1164.1200000000001
ahead so yeah sorry the word blessing is

1161.66 --> 1167.45
actually a curse it actually is a

1164.12 --> 1169.31
derivative from the word to be less so

1167.45 --> 1172.7
when I'm blessing someone even though I

1169.31 --> 1174.71
was taught I'm actually doing opposite

1172.7 --> 1177.6200000000001
that the word comes from the

1174.71 --> 1180.26
understanding of be less so when I bless

1177.62 --> 1183.4399999999998
someone I'm actually cursing them the

1180.26 --> 1191.18
word in Hebrew would be better Baruch or

1183.44 --> 1193.6100000000001
medica because now to take that on just

1191.18 --> 1196.64
that's an example okay now that's in

1193.61 --> 1200.4799999999998
English the word God actually is the

1196.64 --> 1205.7
derivative from the Hebrew word god 3l

1200.48 --> 1208.79
which is Enoch and Enoch 69 6 it is it

1205.7 --> 1210.3500000000001
says the sick the 3rd sorry the third

1208.79 --> 1213.74
meaning the third angel is talked about

1210.35 --> 1219.26
angles here the third is named gadreel

1213.74 --> 1224.06
which is spelled GA d-r-e al okay our EE

1219.26 --> 1228.58
L is a suffix that actually means of L

1224.06 --> 1235.9099999999999
or to be like L or Elohim all right rank

1228.58 --> 1238.6999999999998
GA D is the Hebrew word a has the US and

1235.91 --> 1240.3200000000002
in Hebrew okay which is why sometimes if

1238.7 --> 1242.0
you go back and read ancient text you'll

1240.32 --> 1245.1799999999998
see that if they write it they spell it

1242.0 --> 1247.49
G underscore D the reason they put the

1245.18 --> 1251.48
underscore there are when is to hide the

1247.49 --> 1254.53
the all sound from you because once you

1251.48 --> 1257.99
associate G ad with G OD and you realize

1254.53 --> 1260.45
names are supposed to be transliterated

1257.99 --> 1262.97
not translated that's why Jesus is not

1260.45 --> 1264.8
the name of this ayah because the

1262.97 --> 1267.23
Messiah's name was Hebrew and was

1264.8 --> 1268.73
yahushua the roman catholic church then

1267.23 --> 1272.69
had to come up with a lie

1268.73 --> 1276.02
how they get from yahushua to Jesus for

1272.69 --> 1278.929
example if I went to China

1276.02 --> 1281.24
my name is Joshua they would have to

1278.929 --> 1284.0
find the letters that represent those

1281.24 --> 1287.03
sounds in Chinese so they would say

1284.0 --> 1289.82
Joshua as opposed to Kingdom Hmong

1287.03 --> 1291.53
gong-gong that's not my name they have

1289.82 --> 1294.3799999999999
you names are not to be translated and

1291.53 --> 1297.29
meant to be transliterated that's why in

1294.38 --> 1300.74
Hebrew the father's name is yad hey love

1297.29 --> 1302.48
hey it's yahuwah is how it's pronounced

1300.74 --> 1305.74
I'll go anyway do you reckon this is a

1302.48 --> 1309.85
big Methodist directive in English it's

1305.74 --> 1313.19
goty cuz the O has the off sound in

1309.85 --> 1315.9499999999998
Hebrew so what they've done is they've

1313.19 --> 1320.3
taken the devil's name change the

1315.95 --> 1324.23
letters of it and remove the rtl so that

1320.3 --> 1327.44
you would not associate GOG with G ad

1324.23 --> 1330.26
and then they told you it's a title as

1327.44 --> 1331.8500000000001
opposed to a name well how do we how do

1330.26 --> 1335.03
we how does this prepare itself out in

1331.85 --> 1339.4399999999998
Scripture the devil himself said I will

1335.03 --> 1342.23
put my name above the most highs it's in

1339.44 --> 1344.9
the scripture it says the devil says I

1342.23 --> 1347.6
will place my name in charge of yours or

1344.9 --> 1350.0300000000002
in above yours all right so so if they

1347.6 --> 1353.09
remove the white of the yohalem hey and

1350.03 --> 1356.03
place God above that God's a name not a

1353.09 --> 1358.28
title and so when we've cited God who

1356.03 --> 1361.25
are we praying to that's fascinating

1358.28 --> 1366.32
that's fascinating I personally never

1361.25 --> 1370.34
address God I use God in my wording in

1366.32 --> 1374.03
my in my expressions basically but when

1370.34 --> 1376.6399999999999
I pray I do pray to Jesus Christ and to

1374.03 --> 1380.1399999999999
the Archangel Michael though or rather I

1376.64 --> 1380.14
ask for his assistance and

1381.47 --> 1388.549
it's maybe it's not even prayer it is

1384.409 --> 1391.1290000000001
kind of like prayer but I don't worship

1388.549 --> 1393.889
anything and this is just a technique

1391.129 --> 1396.08
that was advice to me by a healer that's

1393.889 --> 1401.269
been added like his entire life and he

1396.08 --> 1404.75
does incredible incredible things and he

1401.269 --> 1407.659
follows the teachings of Rudolf Steiner

1404.75 --> 1413.629
and yeah you might have heard something

1407.659 --> 1419.21
about that but yeah yeah what they also

1413.629 --> 1420.559
kind of admit is they yeah and that

1419.21 --> 1422.96
those types of teachings

1420.559 --> 1426.139
I even had in school they know about

1422.96 --> 1429.5900000000001
like the power of sound it's very weird

1426.139 --> 1432.9499999999998
and they do practices like sound healing

1429.59 --> 1435.379
it is so awed it is so weird as a kid I

1432.95 --> 1437.929
went under went that went through that

1435.379 --> 1440.799
and it just felt totally ridiculous and

1437.929 --> 1444.6490000000001
embarrassing but I had no idea of what

1440.799 --> 1446.4189999999999
it really was doing and it was in school

1444.649 --> 1449.629
that that was practiced like you were

1446.419 --> 1452.1490000000001
separated like okay you need like this

1449.629 --> 1453.83
therapy or a healing thingy and then it

1452.149 --> 1456.049
was very embarrassing and you did some

1453.83 --> 1458.809
stuff you did made some sounds and moves

1456.049 --> 1460.82
and you had went back again and it

1458.809 --> 1463.009
seemed so ridiculous to me at the time

1460.82 --> 1465.019
but now I understand what that actually

1463.009 --> 1466.97
is and I was just not open to it I was

1465.019 --> 1471.98
way too preoccupied with peer pressure

1466.97 --> 1475.519
and all that and but they do understand

1471.98 --> 1478.279
the the power of sound but what I've

1475.519 --> 1481.7
learned personally is it's not really

1478.279 --> 1483.95
about the semantics and that's a very

1481.7 --> 1485.809
widespread terminology it's not even

1483.95 --> 1488.96
about the wordings it's about the

1485.809 --> 1491.99
frequency of it the frequency of the

1488.96 --> 1494.509
knowledge and of the methodology and you

1491.99 --> 1496.61
can feel this out intuitively before you

1494.509 --> 1500.99
reason it this out I've become very

1496.61 --> 1503.7099999999998
skilled at it and so to me I say Jesus

1500.99 --> 1509.029
Christ but I'm not like really

1503.71 --> 1512.21
addressing a person even it's just I've

1509.029 --> 1514.549
noticed or I've experienced exchange

1512.21 --> 1517.46
style that there is this

1514.549 --> 1523.279
Christ's spirit out there as they call

1517.46 --> 1525.6190000000001
it and it yeah has just all the

1523.279 --> 1529.039
properties of what we would expect of

1525.619 --> 1532.059
the creator of how he's described you'd

1529.039 --> 1537.47
never get to really see anything but

1532.059 --> 1541.399
they do help you out they do like help

1537.47 --> 1544.039
you erase ties like tricks demons pull

1541.399 --> 1546.7099999999998
on you or try to like get a grip on you

1544.039 --> 1548.84
get a tag and eventually yeah you can

1546.71 --> 1550.429
get totally frustrated upset and even

1548.84 --> 1551.9289999999999
become possessed by them and they try

1550.429 --> 1556.46
this trickery all the time

1551.929 --> 1560.299
and yeah well let me look let me let me

1556.46 --> 1562.3400000000001
parties hold on hold on but petitioning

1560.299 --> 1564.889
basically with the Christ spirit and

1562.34 --> 1567.32
interacting with it and letting it heal

1564.889 --> 1571.49
you and all that it really works well

1567.32 --> 1573.6789999999999
and I've had trouble psychological

1571.49 --> 1576.169
trouble it was basically categorized at

1573.679 --> 1578.24
and heavy frustration like all my life

1576.169 --> 1583.73
and periods was very tough but since

1578.24 --> 1586.279
this method I am so balanced I barely

1583.73 --> 1590.72
recognized myself compared to like 10

1586.279 --> 1592.549
years ago 20 years ago I'm so stable now

1590.72 --> 1595.22
yeah I would I would actually tell you

1592.549 --> 1597.999
the same thing about the journey of the

1595.22 --> 1601.8790000000001
father's taking my wife and I on as well

1597.999 --> 1604.07
in that direction the dirty where we

1601.879 --> 1608.049
might differ as I agree with you that

1604.07 --> 1611.1789999999999
it's about frequency absolutely however

1608.049 --> 1615.23
hundreds of times in Scripture we're

1611.179 --> 1618.8300000000002
told to call on his name to pray in his

1615.23 --> 1621.44
name to swear by his name and the church

1618.83 --> 1622.639
has taught us oh don't use the Lord's

1621.44 --> 1623.059
name that you know the father's name in

1622.639 --> 1628.6999999999998
vain

1623.059 --> 1630.769
well that that word vain his is actually

1628.7 --> 1632.749
a twisting of the truth because we're

1630.769 --> 1635.389
told over and over again hold on his

1632.749 --> 1638.029
name hold on his name his name you know

1635.389 --> 1639.9189999999999
if I ask most Christians they will swear

1638.029 --> 1641.869
Jesus Christ is his name even though

1639.919 --> 1645.0800000000002
Jesus Christ right all right hold on I

1641.869 --> 1645.6799999999998
have a very interesting response to that

1645.08 --> 1651.76
that I thought

1645.68 --> 1653.93
okay and that is could name be not a

1651.76 --> 1656.87
personification of somebody but like

1653.93 --> 1660.46
concept like their true name which is

1656.87 --> 1665.2099999999998
like the name is the connection essence

1660.46 --> 1667.76
persona nonverbal or even something

1665.21 --> 1670.82
they've read and just recalling that but

1667.76 --> 1673.58
the essence of it so straight out to

1670.82 --> 1675.35
only that's actually then it wouldn't

1673.58 --> 1677.4199999999998
really matter if you'd said Jesus Christ

1675.35 --> 1679.82
it's not influences for absolutely it

1677.42 --> 1683.0900000000001
would because the sound then is an

1679.82 --> 1685.28
indication is a personification of the

1683.09 --> 1687.9499999999998
character so for example this is why

1685.28 --> 1690.86
it's so important if you call me John I

1687.95 --> 1692.15
will not respond to you right because my

1690.86 --> 1693.8899999999999
name is Joshua Michael well here's the

1692.15 --> 1697.7900000000002
in Hebrew do you know what Joshua

1693.89 --> 1700.18
Michael means you know yahushua makka al

1697.79 --> 1700.18
means

1700.39 --> 1706.25
yahushua well we all know that yahushua

1703.42 --> 1708.3200000000002
actually means yahuwah saves or the

1706.25 --> 1710.84
father saves okay but yahuwah is his

1708.32 --> 1714.53
name mark al means those who were like

1710.84 --> 1717.86
him so it actually yahuwah joshua mark

1714.53 --> 1719.57
al means yahuwah saves those who are

1717.86 --> 1723.35
like him Wow

1719.57 --> 1727.3999999999999
holy [ __ ] you just freaking blew my mind

1723.35 --> 1731.6
dude I did I didn't I didn't know that

1727.4 --> 1733.8500000000001
he was doing that that yeah it fits the

1731.6 --> 1738.08
path of Christ concept and I didn't try

1733.85 --> 1740.6299999999999
to it that is crazy absolutely does Wow

1738.08 --> 1743.1699999999998
that's what yeah and because what

1740.63 --> 1746.2700000000002
because really see and this is where

1743.17 --> 1748.76
when you when I talk to Christians they

1746.27 --> 1750.5
usually because it's all about I mean we

1748.76 --> 1752.81
talked about the blood cult let me

1750.5 --> 1756.41
explain that a little bit I make sure I

1752.81 --> 1759.02
covered my other basis is here the I

1756.41 --> 1761.18
believe Christianity as a whole is a

1759.02 --> 1764.05
blood cult why what is the deafening

1761.18 --> 1769.1000000000001
king of Last Supper

1764.05 --> 1772.04
is that not called ritual well yes and

1769.1 --> 1774.4399999999998
no it was turned into that but see

1772.04 --> 1776.1499999999999
there's a book called the Essene gospel

1774.44 --> 1779.6000000000001
of peace which a lot of Christians will

1776.15 --> 1782.21
deny that that is an actual book of

1779.6 --> 1784.039
Hanan but here but again it comes down

1782.21 --> 1786.169
to the father says I label for you life

1784.039 --> 1789.23
and death good and evil so one of the

1786.169 --> 1793.3090000000002
things that I learned to do is I learned

1789.23 --> 1795.08
to go back and look at history and where

1793.309 --> 1798.23
did the Roman Catholic Church

1795.08 --> 1801.53
go after those who really were trying to

1798.23 --> 1806.33
follow God and one of the books that

1801.53 --> 1808.87
they tried to bury absolutely annihilate

1806.33 --> 1811.9089999999999
the book was the Essene gospel of peace

1808.87 --> 1813.559
if you haven't read it I have copies and

1811.909 --> 1815.3600000000001
I can link it in the video below after

1813.559 --> 1817.8799999999999
after our show for people to at least

1815.36 --> 1820.51
look I told ya put it in my song I'm

1817.88 --> 1823.0100000000002
very curious doesn't even ring a bell

1820.51 --> 1825.4089999999999
yeah I tell people look it can't hurt to

1823.01 --> 1826.9089999999999
read a book read it if throw it away if

1825.409 --> 1829.0100000000002
you don't like it fine whatever but you

1826.909 --> 1831.3200000000002
wanna skim it at least yeah

1829.01 --> 1833.71
in that book Gabriel tells me now here's

1831.32 --> 1836.75
the other thing Gabriel tells Mary

1833.71 --> 1839.299
you're gonna go and take your husband

1836.75 --> 1842.45
see Joseph and Mary were actually

1839.299 --> 1843.799
married the Bible has been twisted into

1842.45 --> 1846.74
sable Mary was a virgin

1843.799 --> 1848.72
no that would defy the laws of physics

1846.74 --> 1851.09
the father would not violate the very

1848.72 --> 1853.01
law he put in place which means that a

1851.09 --> 1856.07
man and woman have to have intercourse

1853.01 --> 1858.3799999999999
in order to have a child what's funny is

1856.07 --> 1859.8799999999999
they removed the Book of Enoch you know

1858.38 --> 1861.169
this gets really convoluted here so I'm

1859.88 --> 1863.72
gonna try and do this in order so that

1861.169 --> 1864.44
people understand how all of this stuff

1863.72 --> 1869.72
comes together

1864.44 --> 1874.159
but in Enoch the father takes aa 200

1869.72 --> 1876.6200000000001
angels and locks them up in down low in

1874.159 --> 1878.929
the lower chambers of shield because

1876.62 --> 1882.5
they have sex with women which is what

1878.929 --> 1884.6000000000001
created the Nephilim or the Giants the

1882.5 --> 1890.27
father then would not take marry and

1884.6 --> 1892.1589999999999
impregnate her after after judging 200

1890.27 --> 1893.6299999999999
angels for basically doing the same

1892.159 --> 1895.7890000000002
thing which is why the Roman Catholic

1893.63 --> 1898.13
Church says oh well that's that sounds

1895.789 --> 1902.57
juicy and right Nick that sounds like

1898.13 --> 1905.39
Zeus right right he did that a lot in

1902.57 --> 1908.59
mythology absolutely do sin the Greek

1905.39 --> 1912.0800000000002
gods were actually fallen angels that

1908.59 --> 1913.3999999999999
tried the Greek pantheon if you go to

1912.08 --> 1916.12
Greece you'll find the Greeks

1913.4 --> 1920.27
believe it's a myth that's their history

1916.12 --> 1922.3999999999999
right so we we have to get away from the

1920.27 --> 1923.93
Western mindset of well this is all

1922.4 --> 1926.51
mythology because we don't believe it oh

1923.93 --> 1929.1200000000001
absolutely agree there is so much hidden

1926.51 --> 1932.99
in there and and for example even things

1929.12 --> 1936.2299999999998
like Irish folklore the weird stuff that

1932.99 --> 1938.809
is in there that to me that's like a

1936.23 --> 1943.13
sign okay there's some really old stuff

1938.809 --> 1945.5
from very far away from when the Irish

1943.13 --> 1947.0
culture was probably a big part of tart

1945.5 --> 1948.679
area and they were spread out all over

1947.0 --> 1951.26
and encountered all these bizarre

1948.679 --> 1955.13
creatures that are no longer there or

1951.26 --> 1958.67
are just so they studied up beyond the

1955.13 --> 1962.0
poles or where wherever you know and and

1958.67 --> 1965.27
it's still just from word of mouth it

1962.0 --> 1968.33
kept in there maybe big twisted here and

1965.27 --> 1972.08
there or maybe a lot it's very hard to

1968.33 --> 1974.6599999999999
tell but still all these weird things so

1972.08 --> 1976.97
I just watch out there yeah I've had a

1974.66 --> 1978.6200000000001
lot of people ask me how I've come to

1976.97 --> 1981.2
mind so let me actually before I keep

1978.62 --> 1982.61
going on this let me sorry guys that I'm

1981.2 --> 1984.8300000000002
not trying to bounce around but I want

1982.61 --> 1987.4099999999999
to give you an understanding because I I

1984.83 --> 1989.03
have been accused of yeah I'm picking

1987.41 --> 1991.19
and choosing the Bible I'm doing all the

1989.03 --> 1994.7
stuff and I'm seeking truth is what I'm

1991.19 --> 1996.89
seeking so yeah I'm trying to figure it

1994.7 --> 2000.059
out from different perspectives and and

1996.89 --> 2003.19
the Bible is kind of meant to do that

2000.059 --> 2006.309
right because here's my personal opinion

2003.19 --> 2008.71
and I'm every time I meet somebody new

2006.309 --> 2010.87
that finds some new angle to the Bible

2008.71 --> 2013.78
and more and more convinced Bible is a

2010.87 --> 2016.9599999999998
multi-dimensional book it is a

2013.78 --> 2021.01
manifestation that is beyond the normal

2016.96 --> 2022.51
3d understanding the linear normal

2021.01 --> 2024.6299999999999
understanding because there are so many

2022.51 --> 2027.8799999999999
things that are happening simultaneously

2024.63 --> 2031.96
and seemingly contrasting but they still

2027.88 --> 2035.8500000000001
all work within it so many sisters the

2031.96 --> 2042.88
the Gnostic system the astrological

2035.85 --> 2044.83
comparisons the it's just so big no so

2042.88 --> 2047.2600000000002
here so there's what happened back back

2044.83 --> 2050.56
in 2013

2047.26 --> 2052.03
I was attending a Jesuit school I didn't

2050.56 --> 2056.2
realize why I was there the father asked

2052.03 --> 2058.21
me to go to Seattle University and I was

2056.2 --> 2060.1589999999997
that I assumed because I had just got my

2058.21 --> 2061.84
bachelor's degree that he had wanted me

2060.159 --> 2063.909
to a master's degree so that was an

2061.84 --> 2066.61
assumption on my part I was there for a

2063.909 --> 2069.4
year I learned a bunch of stuff way

2066.61 --> 2070.54
scary about Catholics and Jesuits so if

2069.4 --> 2073.06
you're Catholic sorry guys I'm not

2070.54 --> 2078.31
trying to be a jerk to the Catholic

2073.06 --> 2080.08
religion but anyway I would huh I

2078.31 --> 2083.38
wouldn't worry too much about it I think

2080.08 --> 2086.38
that most Catholics get that they have

2083.38 --> 2089.59
criticism um like look at the Pope right

2086.38 --> 2091.54
now he's just going to a ballistic so I

2089.59 --> 2093.94
so the father says to me Josh I want you

2091.54 --> 2096.25
to leave school and I'm gonna send you

2093.94 --> 2098.08
to Texas and I and he had this long

2096.25 --> 2100.93
conversation because I was not gonna go

2098.08 --> 2103.5099999999998
to Texas obviously he changed my mind

2100.93 --> 2105.31
and by the time I got home my wife and I

2103.51 --> 2107.4100000000003
were in agreement because she also

2105.31 --> 2108.67
changed her heart and we were like well

2107.41 --> 2110.6499999999996
we just moved to Texas so long story

2108.67 --> 2112.4500000000003
short we he puts a bunch of stuff

2110.65 --> 2113.9500000000003
together there's a whole story there I

2112.45 --> 2116.5
don't have time to go into all of it but

2113.95 --> 2119.47
it was a it was a testing moment for me

2116.5 --> 2120.93
and my wife actually what it was a faith

2119.47 --> 2123.3399999999997
basically or

2120.93 --> 2124.75
can we lean on the father I don't like

2123.34 --> 2126.01
the word faith anymore but can we lean

2124.75 --> 2129.1
on the father can we trust the father

2126.01 --> 2131.65
that that was the the end result testa

2129.1 --> 2135.25
so eviction correct recip convicts a

2131.65 --> 2137.4100000000003
great great word so we get we get to

2135.25 --> 2138.76
Texas and the father says to me Josh I

2137.41 --> 2141.5499999999997
want you to sit read scripture and I

2138.76 --> 2143.0200000000004
will interpret it for you now if you've

2141.55 --> 2145.15
ever had any kind of supernatural

2143.02 --> 2147.1
experience with the Heavenly Father what

2145.15 --> 2149.26
I will tell you it what I what I for my

2147.1 --> 2152.2599999999998
experience when he uses it when he

2149.26 --> 2156.1000000000004
speaks to us it's the word translation

2152.26 --> 2159.07
is as close to our English word as I can

2156.1 --> 2162.73
it's not even a completely accurate word

2159.07 --> 2165.03
because what we what it actually meant

2162.73 --> 2169.06
what he actually meant was I will

2165.03 --> 2172.0
translate what is true versus what is

2169.06 --> 2174.0099999999998
not true in Scripture now the Father

2172.0 --> 2176.11
itself said Josh not everything in

2174.01 --> 2179.9
Scripture is correct not everything in

2176.11 --> 2184.279
Scripture is true well I said

2179.9 --> 2187.789
okay we so assented the father did your

2184.279 --> 2189.98
father my Heavenly Father oh not

2187.789 --> 2191.4500000000003
everything in lot the Bible is correct

2189.98 --> 2193.67
and I can actually back that by

2191.45 --> 2196.46
Scripture that's where I'm going with

2193.67 --> 2197.059
this right right okay and in Jeremiah 8

2196.46 --> 2200.63
8

2197.059 --> 2203.8390000000004
we are told Jeremiah and Jeremiah writes

2200.63 --> 2207.079
out he says how can we say the Torah of

2203.839 --> 2209.69
yahuwah is with us when the lying pen of

2207.079 --> 2211.73
the scribes made it a lie now again

2209.69 --> 2214.67
there's a lot of twisting going on here

2211.73 --> 2216.619
we were taught the pictur aware the

2214.67 --> 2219.319
first five books of the Bible the father

2216.619 --> 2222.76
has corrected that with me the word

2219.319 --> 2226.91
taurah actually means instructions so

2222.76 --> 2230.48
when he when he said that he was

2226.91 --> 2231.799
actually talking about the the two

2230.48 --> 2234.23
things he was talking about the scrolls

2231.799 --> 2238.609
that were given to us for instruction

2234.23 --> 2240.71
and the 10 commandments the 10

2238.609 --> 2243.549
commandments technically is the Torah if

2240.71 --> 2246.41
you look at the word Torah as the law

2243.549 --> 2248.329
the word instructions were all of the

2246.41 --> 2251.3289999999997
scriptures that were given to us for

2248.329 --> 2252.319
learning not just the first five books

2251.329 --> 2254.299
of the Bible the first time looks the

2252.319 --> 2255.77
Bible technically or the Pentateuch is

2254.299 --> 2258.44
what they call the Pentateuch they've

2255.77 --> 2260.63
twisted that so that they can't so that

2258.44 --> 2263.0
the Jews so the Jewish religion can

2260.63 --> 2266.51
teach or the Jewish Zionists religion

2263.0 --> 2267.529
can teach whatever they want I don't

2266.51 --> 2269.6600000000003
know if you know it but Jews actually

2267.529 --> 2273.319
looked at us as going them going we're

2269.66 --> 2277.549
not we're not even sure well today it is

2273.319 --> 2280.4
part of a got a certain group well it is

2277.549 --> 2283.22
kind of like it and split it split up

2280.4 --> 2285.92
among them but there's like the more the

2283.22 --> 2287.6299999999997
more Shepherd Jews basically that's what

2285.92 --> 2290.66
it comes down to I think they even are

2287.63 --> 2293.599
regarded as that and be more yeah the

2290.66 --> 2296.6189999999997
wolf right correct

2293.599 --> 2302.27
the and they see like it themselves

2296.619 --> 2305.1800000000003
right but that well yes yes and no they

2302.27 --> 2309.95
don't if they call you going you're a

2305.18 --> 2311.779
cattle to them right well it's a but but

2309.95 --> 2313.49
here's what it means but it's like a

2311.779 --> 2315.41
derogatory where it's like you

2313.49 --> 2316.9399999999996
unworried right that's technically what

2315.41 --> 2321.2
they mean with it you're a lesser

2316.94 --> 2323.81
writing but the but the point is the

2321.2 --> 2327.5
father sees all of us or he the word

2323.81 --> 2329.72
going the word going Cantrell or Gentile

2327.5 --> 2332.18
also comes from what going we're of the

2329.72 --> 2334.6699999999996
nation but we were of the nation's but

2332.18 --> 2337.0699999999997
here's the point is there were twelve

2334.67 --> 2340.4300000000003
tribes of Israel they all were scattered

2337.07 --> 2344.1800000000003
to the four winds they were mixed among

2340.43 --> 2346.1299999999997
the nation so that whole going thing is

2344.18 --> 2350.27
specifically a religious derogatory term

2346.13 --> 2352.7000000000003
by a single group of people to make

2350.27 --> 2356.75
other people less than themselves yes

2352.7 --> 2361.1299999999997
the father in self never ever ever calls

2356.75 --> 2363.74
us cattle that is not at all in that is

2361.13 --> 2367.09
a complete religious term used to

2363.74 --> 2369.9799999999996
enslave another right and not not just

2367.09 --> 2372.619
humans if you think about it according

2369.98 --> 2375.47
to what you said earlier about the Lord

2372.619 --> 2380.03
not me meaning for any type of animals

2375.47 --> 2383.06
to eat flesh then cattle is per

2380.03 --> 2385.369
definition sinful in that sense even if

2383.06 --> 2389.0
with the cows they started calling the

2385.369 --> 2393.8
cows cattle and eating them right and

2389.0 --> 2396.41
now they call other humans they brain

2393.8 --> 2399.98
basically categorize it in the same way

2396.41 --> 2403.1
and attack it right so to bring this

2399.98 --> 2405.619
around full circle I don't remember if I

2403.1 --> 2408.65
told you in Skype or not but I can bear

2405.619 --> 2411.9500000000003
out the truth that we are actually meant

2408.65 --> 2416.9
to eat plant-based versus animal and

2411.95 --> 2418.46
here's why I can tell I can share that I

2416.9 --> 2421.55
will share this openly because it was

2418.46 --> 2425.56
given me openly so you can't eliminate

2421.55 --> 2429.4700000000003
all sickness illness disease cancer any

2425.56 --> 2433.22
illness from the body actually by going

2429.47 --> 2437.45
plant-based why bio bio chemically our

2433.22 --> 2440.06
bodies were meant to carry what's called

2437.45 --> 2443.81
alkaline blood so blood that is not

2440.06 --> 2446.0
acidic no sickness illness disease

2443.81 --> 2447.41
including cancer according to the most

2446.0 --> 2448.7
high can survive in that

2447.41 --> 2450.89
environment not an important most high

2448.7 --> 2454.0989999999997
that is scientifically and biologically

2450.89 --> 2456.5589999999997
proven so if you take any illness and

2454.099 --> 2459.1400000000003
you drop it in a vial of alkyl alkaline

2456.559 --> 2464.75
water alkyl alkyl ein anything it will

2459.14 --> 2466.93
die however to us humans it's actually

2464.75 --> 2470.859
the strongest type of blood you can have

2466.93 --> 2476.8089999999997
now I've been a plant-based eater for

2470.859 --> 2477.819
well since about 2000 15 ish and I have

2476.809 --> 2480.289
never been sick

2477.819 --> 2485.5389999999998
that's really funny that you mention it

2480.289 --> 2487.94
because I'm a vegetarian since was it

2485.539 --> 2489.8900000000003
last someone no I think almost two years

2487.94 --> 2491.93
now I'm not sure if it is one or two

2489.89 --> 2496.46
years it feels like I've been like this

2491.93 --> 2499.52
forever and I do have like weak periods

2496.46 --> 2502.43
where I'm almost sick almost have like a

2499.52 --> 2504.53
little I don't want really would you

2502.43 --> 2507.3799999999997
like to know why you still have view eat

2504.53 --> 2510.4100000000003
animal proteins no yeah I I'm a

2507.38 --> 2512.9900000000002
vegetarian not a vegan okay but they're

2510.41 --> 2516.049
very sparingly I'm very sparingly with

2512.99 --> 2519.1699999999996
the the use of cheese and milk oddly I

2516.049 --> 2521.599
don't get drink it like that just use it

2519.17 --> 2523.88
as flavoring basically that's I changed

2521.599 --> 2525.92
I changed it to cow milk out of my diet

2523.88 --> 2528.799
and went to cashew milk when I did that

2525.92 --> 2532.849
my body I noticed a physical actual

2528.799 --> 2535.7889999999998
increase in my health someone in the

2532.849 --> 2538.369
chat I saw had talked about dairy the

2535.789 --> 2542.69
period of the problem with Dairy Dairy

2538.369 --> 2545.42
is still an animal protein dairy all did

2542.69 --> 2548.329
all animal proteins still affects the

2545.42 --> 2552.829
blood and still brings it down it still

2548.329 --> 2556.21
turns the blood acidic now folks I met

2552.829 --> 2558.799
I'm a pizza love and cheese loving

2556.21 --> 2562.299
person I'm I still once in a while

2558.799 --> 2566.45
struggle with it just a few just a few

2562.299 --> 2568.22
days ago because of the circumstances I

2566.45 --> 2571.1899999999996
was in I had to buy pizza had to eat

2568.22 --> 2573.1299999999997
cheese okay I didn't have to I we chose

2571.19 --> 2576.7400000000002
to but here's the point

2573.13 --> 2579.73
the more you switch over the more your

2576.74 --> 2583.9599999999996
body then will correct itself

2579.73 --> 2586.63
if you if we return to this we will find

2583.96 --> 2590.589
you will find that the body actually

2586.63 --> 2595.75
heals itself immunizations are a poison

2590.589 --> 2601.0299999999997
to the body I agree with you I agree

2595.75 --> 2604.75
with you as you as you what add to the

2601.03 --> 2607.78
blood actually weakens it yeah well

2604.75 --> 2609.609
that's why I use expiring Lee look I'm

2607.78 --> 2614.05
trying to find a balance in between

2609.609 --> 2616.839
having an enjoyable life and gradually

2614.05 --> 2619.96
moving to where I need to go okay I'm

2616.839 --> 2622.99
not gonna jump it it knows like trying

2619.96 --> 2626.41
to like oh I'm gonna stop drinking when

2622.99 --> 2628.2999999999997
being an alcoholic it's so brutally

2626.41 --> 2630.8199999999997
difficult so I'm just transitioning

2628.3 --> 2634.4500000000003
taking some of the fruits of what I quit

2630.82 --> 2638.079
with while still having some joy left

2634.45 --> 2641.02
and at the same time then try to find

2638.079 --> 2645.3100000000004
something new that is more adapted to

2641.02 --> 2647.92
where I'm going well here's just kind of

2645.31 --> 2650.68
back up what you were saying the father

2647.92 --> 2652.15
slowly took me out of our diet

2650.68 --> 2654.31
well even slow some things he

2652.15 --> 2655.81
immediately removed and I thought I

2654.31 --> 2658.21
would have a reaction and didn't like

2655.81 --> 2661.119
pork wasn't immediate come out red meat

2658.21 --> 2664.119
wasn't me immediately and I was actually

2661.119 --> 2665.859
a chef at Baylor University for a year

2664.119 --> 2667.81
and a half and I was cutting up some

2665.859 --> 2668.3489999999997
chicken I had removed everything out of

2667.81 --> 2670.63
our diet

2668.349 --> 2671.98
except for chicken and turkey basically

2670.63 --> 2675.4900000000002
my wife and I were down a chicken a

2671.98 --> 2677.319
turkey turkey is sitting yeah and the

2675.49 --> 2679.66
father said Josh I want you to come off

2677.319 --> 2681.79
all meat and I said there's no way I can

2679.66 --> 2683.56
do that I've cut all all meats thus far

2681.79 --> 2686.109
out of my diet I said if you want me to

2683.56 --> 2690.339
change you're going to need to change my

2686.109 --> 2694.869
heart now when I did that I released to

2690.339 --> 2696.849
him my will to his and so what I did

2694.869 --> 2698.9500000000003
what happened was when I said that I had

2696.849 --> 2701.26
not finished saying the word heart when

2698.95 --> 2703.72
I felt the switch flipped in my body and

2701.26 --> 2705.2200000000003
I turned back and looked at the table

2703.72 --> 2707.29
where I was cutting all this meat and

2705.22 --> 2710.7599999999998
all of a sudden I realized I've got a

2707.29 --> 2713.13
bunch of corpses on my table

2710.76 --> 2714.42
I could no longer look at it the same

2713.13 --> 2717.21
way ever again

2714.42 --> 2719.04
I it was it was the most amazing thing I

2717.21 --> 2721.53
dad is so weird

2719.04 --> 2724.109
it kind of happened to me in a similar

2721.53 --> 2726.63
way although with me I'd been thinking

2724.109 --> 2728.49
about it for a long time being

2726.63 --> 2730.67
confronted about like yes you should

2728.49 --> 2733.74
actually be stopped stop eating meat

2730.67 --> 2735.829
several reasons and then yeah been

2733.74 --> 2738.839
thinking about that for over ten years

2735.829 --> 2740.94
right and I've never been gorging myself

2738.839 --> 2744.2999999999997
on me because that that just doesn't

2740.94 --> 2747.21
feel right and then eventually I got to

2744.3 --> 2750.119
a point where I just suddenly the switch

2747.21 --> 2752.04
kind of just happened and then I ate

2750.119 --> 2754.32
something and I almost yeah like a

2752.04 --> 2756.3
hamburger even organic and everything

2754.32 --> 2758.31
and it just couldn't handle it it was

2756.3 --> 2760.77
just like this is so disgusting I don't

2758.31 --> 2763.5299999999997
want to eat this again it was so weird

2760.77 --> 2766.109
it just changed it just well the body

2763.53 --> 2768.599
also doesn't process me it decays in the

2766.109 --> 2771.0
body and then it pulls the secondary the

2768.599 --> 2774.03
broken secondary protein right where

2771.0 --> 2776.369
whereas it's a very complex metabolic

2774.03 --> 2778.71
process that requires a lot of vitamins

2776.369 --> 2780.51
and nutrients from your body in order to

2778.71 --> 2782.94
process it and you have to provide that

2780.51 --> 2784.579
with the meat or you're going to be in

2782.94 --> 2787.7400000000002
trouble and actually robbing your body

2784.579 --> 2789.0600000000004
right well here's the other again here's

2787.74 --> 2791.25
the other thing unless you have to write

2789.06 --> 2793.8289999999997
your enzymes to digest it and humans

2791.25 --> 2795.569
don't have that naturally right look at

2793.829 --> 2798.48
what a cow look at what a cow look at

2795.569 --> 2801.869
what most animals eat they eat plants

2798.48 --> 2803.64
why because bioavailable protein is what

2801.869 --> 2804.98
we should be taking into the body when

2803.64 --> 2806.8489999999997
you eat meat you're not eating

2804.98 --> 2808.89
bioavailable protein you're eating

2806.849 --> 2813.589
what's called a secondary protein all

2808.89 --> 2817.74
right okay all amino acids folks all

2813.589 --> 2818.72
100% of amino acids come from plants not

2817.74 --> 2821.8799999999997
animals

2818.72 --> 2824.43
yeah although there's one exception I

2821.88 --> 2829.349
have to my vegetarianism and that is

2824.43 --> 2831.75
fish oil and I will probably never stop

2829.349 --> 2835.44
doing that because that is a better me

2831.75 --> 2837.66
are so incredible to me it basically

2835.44 --> 2840.2400000000002
comes comes down to either I keep using

2837.66 --> 2842.2799999999997
fish oil and that's funny because I

2840.24 --> 2843.5099999999998
never eat fish I don't even like the

2842.28 --> 2846.48
taste of it but

2843.51 --> 2849.2900000000004
has such an important function for me

2846.48 --> 2852.6
that it would be that or like

2849.29 --> 2856.35
psychiatric medication because if I keep

2852.6 --> 2860.43
on using it and I don't I never get

2856.35 --> 2862.2599999999998
depressed beyond a certain threshold and

2860.43 --> 2863.85
without it I'm gonna dress I'm gonna

2862.26 --> 2865.8590000000004
dress that and I'm gonna market from

2863.85 --> 2869.0699999999997
Melbourne in the chat just said no b12

2865.859 --> 2872.22
that's not correct mark b12 comes from

2869.07 --> 2873.75
the ground it's so hard soil barbarian

2872.22 --> 2877.0499999999997
long time correct

2873.75 --> 2880.17
so actually we get our b12 I get my b12

2877.05 --> 2883.619
from working the garden yeah or are just

2880.17 --> 2887.3
wash their de vegetables yeah don't wash

2883.619 --> 2889.44
your vegetables or yeah I mean yeah it's

2887.3 --> 2891.75
normally we would take the vegetable off

2889.44 --> 2894.09
the vine and eat it directly anyway dirt

2891.75 --> 2895.619
is not gonna hurt you we're gonna at all

2894.09 --> 2897.75
wash your vegetables because it's dirty

2895.619 --> 2899.13
no no the reason they tell you to do

2897.75 --> 2902.73
that is because you're washing the b12

2899.13 --> 2905.28
only and that's what you're doing so

2902.73 --> 2907.26
anyway the other thing is do you do you

2905.28 --> 2909.9
eat fish because of the B or need fish

2907.26 --> 2914.0400000000004
because of the because the vitamin E is

2909.9 --> 2917.88
that the issue organic fish oil and

2914.04 --> 2919.56
krill oil by the way as well but what

2917.88 --> 2923.609
are those mineral of you but I'm not

2919.56 --> 2926.16
eating any physical fiber or it's just

2923.609 --> 2929.22
the fats and the specific substances

2926.16 --> 2932.91
that are uniquely absorbed in them it's

2929.22 --> 2936.0
just it's only a fish it has a super

2932.91 --> 2938.46
here it has a very big impact on all

2936.0 --> 2940.08
peoples that tradition what I'm asking

2938.46 --> 2942.39
is you can there are other there are

2940.08 --> 2944.79
other ways of getting the same vitamins

2942.39 --> 2949.5899999999997
it's an official without killing the

2944.79 --> 2952.68
fish okay well it's not just vitamins

2949.59 --> 2955.98
it's did this the types of fats and the

2952.68 --> 2958.74
proteins I may I need fats fats are good

2955.98 --> 2961.35
for you I have a fat rich diet I just

2958.74 --> 2965.7
have butter I use it a lot

2961.35 --> 2969.15
olive oil coconut fat and fish oil

2965.7 --> 2972.5699999999997
I don't know coconut oil but it works

2969.15 --> 2974.67
really well for me coconut oil and olive

2972.57 --> 2975.06
oil are not animal-based I know I'm

2974.67 --> 2977.39
trying

2975.06 --> 2980.63
yeah what I'm trying to tell you is

2977.39 --> 2982.46
but in the fats do you need because it's

2980.63 --> 2986.48
not the fat you need it's whatever

2982.46 --> 2989.36
minerals are in that fat no it's the

2986.48 --> 2991.19
combination of it all no because fat you

2989.36 --> 2993.05
can get fat from mushrooms you get fat

2991.19 --> 2995.6
from from the plants you don't need

2993.05 --> 2997.04
animal fats for the body you can get

2995.6 --> 3000.0699999999997
plenty of fats from from the plant-based

2997.04 --> 3003.79
animals right although the fat from

3000.07 --> 3006.28
animals is probably still the best if if

3003.79 --> 3008.77
you can manage to keep like GMO and

3006.28 --> 3011.05
pesticide [ __ ] out of the food base of

3008.77 --> 3013.81
these animal this is just honest truth

3011.05 --> 3015.82
but it's only the fats not the fibers

3013.81 --> 3019.15
and definitely not the blood and all

3015.82 --> 3021.46
that but that's still in relation the

3019.15 --> 3024.1
most usable product about it and it has

3021.46 --> 3025.75
definite positive effects as long it's

3024.1 --> 3028.66
not polluted and you don't overdo it

3025.75 --> 3030.22
that's that's that's not true but I

3028.66 --> 3033.22
would I would encourage you to keep

3030.22 --> 3035.35
researching it but I will end this right

3033.22 --> 3038.83
there before because it's not it's just

3035.35 --> 3040.75
not true well I'm because now I open

3038.83 --> 3045.31
minded end dynamic I'm not going to be

3040.75 --> 3048.34
rigid about it I also very much enjoy my

3045.31 --> 3050.86
leather coat and everything in my

3048.34 --> 3053.8
leather shoes so in that sense I don't

3050.86 --> 3055.84
see that that separation and I even

3053.8 --> 3058.51
speculated what if we went like a

3055.84 --> 3061.6000000000004
hundred percent vegan society everywhere

3058.51 --> 3065.71
well a lot of the animals would start

3061.6 --> 3067.96
dying out let me tell ya what use oh

3065.71 --> 3070.57
really so what's gonna be where are

3067.96 --> 3072.73
these hundreds of thousands of cows are

3070.57 --> 3075.9100000000003
gonna go all of a sudden when they're no

3072.73 --> 3077.64
they're no longer employed by farms I

3075.91 --> 3081.79
think they're just gonna be let loose

3077.64 --> 3084.85
grass the goal of their lives no but

3081.79 --> 3086.71
that I grass is in a space specifically

3084.85 --> 3090.61
designated for them because they're in

3086.71 --> 3094.0
industrial it's gonna something else is

3090.61 --> 3095.65
gonna move in because you're at ease yes

3094.0 --> 3098.17
that's what's got this pragmatic yes

3095.65 --> 3100.9
that's how nations new things find a

3098.17 --> 3105.64
balance nature will find a balance

3100.9 --> 3108.349
it always does always if it is given a

3105.64 --> 3110.8689999999997
chance but usually society

3108.349 --> 3115.9100000000003
a little faster than nature comes to

3110.869 --> 3118.94
that well you have far more food on the

3115.91 --> 3121.7
planet than you do animals food meaning

3118.94 --> 3123.319
plant-based right I have agreed to that

3121.7 --> 3124.7889999999998
in the situation we're in is because

3123.319 --> 3127.009
we're eating animals that's part of the

3124.789 --> 3130.789
reason in fact the pharmaceutical

3127.009 --> 3132.319
companies bank on that because they know

3130.789 --> 3135.259
animals make us sick

3132.319 --> 3138.0389999999998
yeah I agree to that that is fun and I

3135.259 --> 3141.049
do not even deny that but I still say no

3138.039 --> 3143.539
we should have a transition society

3141.049 --> 3147.349
where basically people can either be

3143.539 --> 3151.039
vegetarian or vegan if they want or just

3147.349 --> 3154.369
still have meat but don't don't eat like

3151.039 --> 3157.809
a lion that's just how you support it

3154.369 --> 3160.9
then you still support a death culture

3157.809 --> 3163.4
yeah cuz you still want to use leather

3160.9 --> 3165.7690000000002
well like I said I'm completely against

3163.4 --> 3166.88
leather so ok well I'm not I'm not that

3165.769 --> 3170.2389999999996
tight they don't know how to die for

3166.88 --> 3172.4
that right well yeah that means that

3170.239 --> 3175.279
means you're placing your didn't in

3172.4 --> 3177.38
philosophy philosophy was you know again

3175.279 --> 3179.029
I'm not judging you I'm simply pointing

3177.38 --> 3181.069
out the philosophy of the difference

3179.029 --> 3183.049
between the two you're placing an

3181.069 --> 3185.9
animal's life above yours when the most

3183.049 --> 3190.4
high said in the Bible to kill an ox is

3185.9 --> 3193.969
the same as to kill a man that means

3190.4 --> 3195.529
it's murder to kill a cow whether you

3193.969 --> 3196.9990000000003
like it or not that's what it says well

3195.529 --> 3200.599
if you'd like I'll show you the

3196.999 --> 3203.1499999999996
scripture that's finite I don't need to

3200.599 --> 3205.7290000000003
I don't need to see that okay I'm still

3203.15 --> 3206.96
gonna be doing there I'm not killing the

3205.729 --> 3209.269
creatures and you're not willing to

3206.96 --> 3212.39
change and I'm being very sparingly I'm

3209.269 --> 3216.14
being very sparingly but I just don't

3212.39 --> 3218.989
see the user just completely removing it

3216.14 --> 3222.019
if it just happens to transit out of

3218.989 --> 3223.91
there culturally naturally but to be

3222.019 --> 3225.9199999999996
putting about it no belief right is

3223.91 --> 3230.509
right and wrong is wrong or do you

3225.92 --> 3234.609
believe in a gray area I believe in a

3230.509 --> 3237.65
lack yeah an unresolved lack of clarity

3234.609 --> 3242.029
so when the father says thou shalt not

3237.65 --> 3244.789
kill and a word kill actually in he

3242.029 --> 3246.979
to intern the word turn sock which means

3244.789 --> 3249.4390000000003
anything with the blood of life that are

3246.979 --> 3251.359
in right well look you can interpret

3249.439 --> 3254.239
that in many ways you can interpret that

3251.359 --> 3256.959
as like if you violate this you will go

3254.239 --> 3258.889
to hell you will have a mark on them

3256.959 --> 3259.999
know what I'm saying what the

3258.889 --> 3265.429
possibilities are

3259.999 --> 3267.8889999999997
or you just get a jab from God when you

3265.429 --> 3269.9590000000003
do something wrong noticeably that is

3267.889 --> 3272.239
what I see as a sin a sin is just

3269.959 --> 3275.6789999999996
something is a direct punishment or

3272.239 --> 3278.839
indirect as a tension that arises and

3275.679 --> 3280.599
that is the sin and it is direct cause

3278.839 --> 3283.219
of what you do because of what it is

3280.599 --> 3285.619
because of the frequency is the

3283.219 --> 3289.189
frequency of the act that is the sin

3285.619 --> 3291.529
that is the natural thing that it is no

3289.189 --> 3293.5989999999997
the sin of sin is to break the commands

3291.529 --> 3296.469
of yahuwah that is what is defined as a

3293.599 --> 3299.079
sin we've we have we've assigned our own

3296.469 --> 3302.869
beliefs to things because we want to

3299.079 --> 3305.4190000000003
tell God what is and isn't but that's

3302.869 --> 3307.609
not actually how the order of the

3305.419 --> 3309.499
universe works it all works through what

3307.609 --> 3313.249
the father said first so if the father

3309.499 --> 3315.259
said a sin is breaking the command my

3313.249 --> 3317.749
commands which is what he defines it as

3315.259 --> 3319.929
in the Bible but we can't we can't

3317.749 --> 3323.749
assign our own understanding and on our

3319.929 --> 3325.819
own thing to that well yeah we have to

3323.749 --> 3327.919
because we have to interpret it in some

3325.819 --> 3330.259
way and this correlates to my

3327.919 --> 3334.339
explanation of earlier of it earlier and

3330.259 --> 3336.679
that is there are innumerable amounts of

3334.339 --> 3338.239
angles to all of this and it trust me

3336.679 --> 3340.4590000000003
there will be somebody out there that

3338.239 --> 3343.279
can definitely write on to what you're

3340.459 --> 3346.1589999999997
saying and build a logical support

3343.279 --> 3347.989
structure against it well of course

3346.159 --> 3351.559
there is that's why we have planned that

3347.989 --> 3353.929
will sound true and he will they will be

3351.559 --> 3356.8990000000003
able to really back it up just as well

3353.929 --> 3358.819
so this is your this is your what's real

3356.899 --> 3361.939
or your approach to it you you're just

3358.819 --> 3364.909
very convicted about it and you've made

3361.939 --> 3366.439
the steps and well the making the steps

3364.909 --> 3369.649
is the most important part about a

3366.439 --> 3373.0989999999997
conviction I'm not there and I'm also

3369.649 --> 3375.6389999999997
not gonna be forced by anyone to know

3373.099 --> 3375.639
I'm not

3375.849 --> 3384.5
in with society because I do understand

3380.0 --> 3386.3
it like suffering of animals and like

3384.5 --> 3390.55
especially like treating them as a

3386.3 --> 3393.38
commodity and as as product that is just

3390.55 --> 3397.07
the carbon not bad it's just it feels

3393.38 --> 3399.1400000000003
bad it feels derogatory it's just not

3397.07 --> 3402.1400000000003
honoring the life spirit that is within

3399.14 --> 3404.109
them wait wait wait wait so killing the

3402.14 --> 3407.33
animal honors the life spirit you know

3404.109 --> 3409.8199999999997
well okay unless you truly honor them

3407.33 --> 3413.39
but then it becomes like more a a SUP

3409.82 --> 3417.23
ritual a an honoring ritual and that is

3413.39 --> 3419.48
I used to ascribe to that and just say

3417.23 --> 3422.78
like okay if you're gonna kill something

3419.48 --> 3425.18
then at least use everything about it

3422.78 --> 3428.0600000000004
don't let anything be wasted and honor

3425.18 --> 3429.83
what you have over the remains excused

3428.06 --> 3432.83
but you're still taking the life of that

3429.83 --> 3433.91
animal yeah but that if that happened

3432.83 --> 3436.67
that happened

3433.91 --> 3438.7999999999997
is it better to look yeah if but that

3436.67 --> 3440.48
happened look and it's about if you're

3438.8 --> 3443.78
gonna get to a point where you decide

3440.48 --> 3446.81
that then afterward at least have the

3443.78 --> 3449.5400000000004
common decency to honor it and to

3446.81 --> 3452.18
remember it for eight sacrifice for you

3449.54 --> 3454.97
basically that's the angle to itself

3452.18 --> 3459.89
said if God said it is wrong to do this

3454.97 --> 3462.859
who are you then to say it's not right

3459.89 --> 3467.48
well that from that specific perspective

3462.859 --> 3470.75
that is simply ignored okay as long as

3467.48 --> 3473.42
if you can admit that then of course all

3470.75 --> 3476.3
right I am NOT saying I'm I am even

3473.42 --> 3479.03
without sin in that sense but I'm not

3476.3 --> 3481.2200000000003
trying to aim for like a perfection holy

3479.03 --> 3483.98
man that's gonna be the ultimate

3481.22 --> 3488.5699999999997
pinnacle I'm trying to get a perfect

3483.98 --> 3493.04
Road for myself that is also aimed at

3488.57 --> 3496.19
other things I'm okay like I said I'm

3493.04 --> 3500.06
not trying I'm not trying to hold on one

3496.19 --> 3503.119
sec r1 right my boys are up and getting

3500.06 --> 3505.4
ready to go school I'm what I'm trying

3503.119 --> 3508.599
to do is kind of find a common ground

3505.4 --> 3514.029
for the

3508.599 --> 3516.489
the overly modernizing society and logos

3514.029 --> 3518.469
Christian think yeah the Christian

3516.489 --> 3520.509
common decency the old-fashioned thing

3518.469 --> 3522.279
to find a middle road that is just

3520.509 --> 3524.619
sensible for everything and allows

3522.279 --> 3528.209
everything to continue in a way that

3524.619 --> 3530.559
there's still some kind of progress

3528.209 --> 3533.2889999999998
without degrading everything without

3530.559 --> 3535.929
making everything worse because yeah we

3533.289 --> 3540.0690000000004
do see that kind of thing happening like

3535.929 --> 3541.449
things are getting worse well they're

3540.069 --> 3544.449
not gonna get better until they are

3541.449 --> 3546.4790000000003
getting worse privacy rights getting

3544.449 --> 3551.349
worse all these things getting worse and

3546.479 --> 3553.8089999999997
I'm trying to figure out like okay how

3551.349 --> 3557.319
can we improve it naturally and find a

3553.809 --> 3560.3190000000004
balance that makes mostly everyone can

3557.319 --> 3563.14
agree to wouldn't wouldn't find

3560.319 --> 3565.179
something in two totally object about it

3563.14 --> 3566.709
and if you're just gonna say no meet

3565.179 --> 3571.089
there's just gonna be people out there

3566.709 --> 3574.209
just gonna say no way absolutely so if

3571.089 --> 3577.179
you find a middle road again Danny Boy

3574.209 --> 3580.209
is less important than my own when a

3577.179 --> 3583.39
father said it is it is as as important

3580.209 --> 3585.669
as my own so I can't agree with society

3583.39 --> 3588.279
society is wrong Society has always been

3585.669 --> 3590.8289999999997
wrong the mass that's the way it is

3588.279 --> 3593.559
either the Creator is right and man is

3590.829 --> 3595.449
wrong or we don't even need the Creator

3593.559 --> 3601.619
all right there's a military helicopter

3595.449 --> 3601.619
flying over we are they coming to get me

3603.689 --> 3611.719
spike it tomahawk

3606.799 --> 3614.4
ya don't see those every day

3611.719 --> 3616.17
sorry getting really distracted that's

3614.4 --> 3618.839
right so anyway we can change the

3616.17 --> 3620.88
subject if you'd like I just I I can't

3618.839 --> 3624.239
go against what the Creator said to me

3620.88 --> 3626.039
so okay we can win that we can debate

3624.239 --> 3629.039
philosophy although I'm still in

3626.039 --> 3631.7090000000003
negotiations no all right and the

3629.039 --> 3636.029
literally that it's to me it sounds very

3631.709 --> 3638.819
Jewish it's a negotiation process over

3636.029 --> 3641.519
my lifetime because I got like

3638.819 --> 3643.349
enlightening moments very young but I

3641.519 --> 3646.3489999999997
just felt like yes this is just

3643.349 --> 3649.17
impossible I have so many mistakes left

3646.349 --> 3652.199
to make I can't just do it all right

3649.17 --> 3655.7090000000003
right away it just didn't feel right and

3652.199 --> 3657.66
I went the left-hand path early on in

3655.709 --> 3660.049
that sense still trying to be

3657.66 --> 3662.519
good-natured but left hand and

3660.049 --> 3664.679
eventually things got messed up i

3662.519 --> 3666.8689999999997
spanned sort of out of control without

3664.679 --> 3671.549
doing even too much damage except mostly

3666.869 --> 3676.799
to myself and then finally I kind of

3671.549 --> 3679.589
woke up so well it's just a gradual

3676.799 --> 3681.299
process and I know it is I know process

3679.589 --> 3683.13
yeah it's a process but it's also like I

3681.299 --> 3685.979
get to look at her and hear something

3683.13 --> 3690.4790000000003
and then I know I'm resisting that but I

3685.979 --> 3693.209
know that over time I will get there and

3690.479 --> 3696.209
I can already see that movement in the

3693.209 --> 3699.569
future I can see it but I can't go there

3696.209 --> 3701.939
and nip that I I have a lot of respect

3699.569 --> 3705.719
for you that you can admit that most

3701.939 --> 3707.5789999999997
people cannot admit that it's very weird

3705.719 --> 3710.459
it's a weird thing about this world is

3707.579 --> 3712.199
that just because you can cognitively

3710.459 --> 3713.989
understand something doesn't mean that

3712.199 --> 3716.7290000000003
you can switch yourself around

3713.989 --> 3719.099
instantaneously Thanks separation and

3716.729 --> 3721.979
most people don't even understand that

3719.099 --> 3724.4100000000003
because it is it's behind the

3721.979 --> 3727.2889999999998
communication it's behind me it's what

3724.41 --> 3731.219
happens inside we'll see here if I can

3727.289 --> 3734.369
add to that in Scripture we it says the

3731.219 --> 3736.319
lust of flesh Christians read it as the

3734.369 --> 3738.719
lust of the flesh but it's not a sexual

3736.319 --> 3739.89
issue it's lust of flesh which means

3738.719 --> 3742.079
that when you eat eat

3739.89 --> 3744.75
meet it's actually a lust for the body

3742.079 --> 3747.3590000000004
okay we crave it we lost it like we

3744.75 --> 3750.18
would any drug here's the thing it's a

3747.359 --> 3752.22
process so when the father says hey yes

3750.18 --> 3754.2889999999998
stop doing this I didn't have a choice

3752.22 --> 3756.39
but I realized that I couldn't do it so

3754.289 --> 3758.4900000000002
I pleaded to him to change me

3756.39 --> 3761.1299999999997
his ultimate would happen and he did so

3758.49 --> 3762.8689999999997
and he did so quickly not everybody can

3761.13 --> 3766.38
do that first of all you have to be

3762.869 --> 3769.44
willing to allow that change to occur if

3766.38 --> 3770.88
you're not willing to do that then then

3769.44 --> 3773.279
it can't be done because he's not going

3770.88 --> 3774.9300000000003
to violate your will however like you

3773.279 --> 3776.73
said it's a process and we're all on

3774.93 --> 3782.4199999999996
different we're all in different places

3776.73 --> 3785.43
on the path of our understanding so yep

3782.42 --> 3786.75
you know it's easy I was not judging you

3785.43 --> 3789.8689999999997
there's no judgment here either all

3786.75 --> 3793.019
right so I no no no I get that you're

3789.869 --> 3795.839
just being you're basically really

3793.019 --> 3798.089
forcing your own your own fuel on it and

3795.839 --> 3802.519
that's I get that I totally get that and

3798.089 --> 3808.44
I respect that you are where you are so

3802.519 --> 3810.1189999999997
yeah it's some dedication and I'm not at

3808.44 --> 3812.2200000000003
that point yet I'm still focused on a

3810.119 --> 3816.119
lot of other things I'm just going there

3812.22 --> 3817.799
gradually yeah yeah and and we all do

3816.119 --> 3819.869
like I said like we've like we've agreed

3817.799 --> 3822.809
on different places at different times

3819.869 --> 3825.0
at different speeds so right it's it's a

3822.809 --> 3827.46
journey that we're all taking you know

3825.0 --> 3830.279
basically our on our own but we're all

3827.46 --> 3833.25
here together and also one of these

3830.279 --> 3835.67
interesting concepts about reflecting on

3833.25 --> 3838.47
what I said just a few minutes ago about

3835.67 --> 3842.549
that you sometimes just need time to let

3838.47 --> 3845.0989999999997
things get there inside of you how many

3842.549 --> 3847.5
people when they're like older tell

3845.099 --> 3849.42
stories about what they were told when

3847.5 --> 3850.769
they were young and they were like no

3849.42 --> 3852.809
way I'm not gonna do that that's

3850.769 --> 3855.5089999999996
[ __ ] I totally disagree I'm going

3852.809 --> 3857.789
exactly against that and then when

3855.509 --> 3859.68
they're older they totally get it and

3857.789 --> 3862.44
they say yeah I was totally right and

3859.68 --> 3865.0789999999997
right basically that's it that's wisdom

3862.44 --> 3868.17
wisdom is basically the time that is

3865.079 --> 3870.9900000000002
naturally required in order for you to

3868.17 --> 3872.349
transform upon knowledge the knowledge

3870.99 --> 3875.109
can come in

3872.349 --> 3877.329
gently but your soul and your system

3875.109 --> 3879.88
needs to transform and that's a slow

3877.329 --> 3882.9700000000003
process that's an excellent way of

3879.88 --> 3885.279
saying it right and that's wisdom and I

3882.97 --> 3888.9399999999996
love it because now I'm old so I can

3885.279 --> 3890.729
appreciate ya learning from all the

3888.94 --> 3896.289
mistakes that I've made in the past

3890.729 --> 3898.269
right so one of the one of the things

3896.289 --> 3901.989
that I that I that I have to deal with

3898.269 --> 3904.029
is especially with people in public

3901.989 --> 3907.18
which is why I don't

3904.029 --> 3909.43
I usually don't really talk too much

3907.18 --> 3911.14
about it except on air or to somebody

3909.43 --> 3912.549
else that is close enough that my circle

3911.14 --> 3915.7
is I wind up

3912.549 --> 3918.069
I find that meat eaters typically like

3915.7 --> 3921.1299999999997
to throw in my face their consumption of

3918.069 --> 3924.7
meat so when they find out that I'm I'm

3921.13 --> 3926.289
technically not vegan because I do once

3924.7 --> 3928.569
in a while I still eat animal yeah they

3926.289 --> 3930.6400000000003
want to trigger they want to they do

3928.569 --> 3932.44
want to be like oh my god I'm gonna go

3930.64 --> 3934.42
I'm gonna go you know cook up a steak

3932.44 --> 3937.39
right now I had AG one guy tell me he

3934.42 --> 3939.039
says no after knowing what I think and

3937.39 --> 3941.2
knowing what I wear on that he's like

3939.039 --> 3943.3590000000004
well we'll go out sometime and I'll buy

3941.2 --> 3945.3999999999996
you a big juicy steak dude that is so

3943.359 --> 3947.799
disrespectful yeah but that's trolls

3945.4 --> 3949.9
there's a lot of people I see that even

3947.799 --> 3951.969
in Patricia steers hang out sometimes

3949.9 --> 3956.2290000000003
like fried chicken

3951.969 --> 3957.849
it's just trolls you know right well

3956.229 --> 3959.3799999999997
what I want to try and encourage people

3957.849 --> 3962.529
is we still need me loving to one

3959.38 --> 3965.049
another if if someone I don't go to a

3962.529 --> 3969.369
vegan and say hey I eat the cheese and

3965.049 --> 3972.549
eggs and we we still need to be loving

3969.369 --> 3975.819
to one another and it's hard to do that

3972.549 --> 3982.809
the more our bodies are poisoned because

3975.819 --> 3984.5389999999998
we we want to impose our own beliefs on

3982.809 --> 3987.1600000000003
people distractions yeah police

3984.539 --> 3989.44
interaction yeah correct what we

3987.16 --> 3993.5389999999998
preoccupy ourselves with when we're in

3989.44 --> 3994.719
that right that state right that's right

3993.539 --> 3998.0490000000004
yep

3994.719 --> 4000.329
yeah I agree hey I think I'm gonna round

3998.049 --> 4002.67
out the show we've been going for yeah

4000.329 --> 4004.8900000000003
over an hour and I think debates alright

4002.67 --> 4008.309
starting up it's been a

4004.89 --> 4011.3689999999997
great great early bird with you on that

4008.309 --> 4013.5890000000004
with amazing discussion we should do

4011.369 --> 4016.23
this again sometime if you have absolute

4013.589 --> 4017.97
you can find the time for it absolutely

4016.23 --> 4020.22
I just need to know when now that I know

4017.97 --> 4021.029
what I have to get up to do the show

4020.22 --> 4023.73
with you

4021.029 --> 4025.529
I just delegate we can do it any time

4023.73 --> 4029.819
yeah it was a lot of fun and I

4025.529 --> 4033.779
appreciate the the way you discuss

4029.819 --> 4036.119
things with people thank you yeah

4033.779 --> 4037.95
absolutely I do my best mostly not to

4036.119 --> 4039.869
constantly over talk to you there

4037.95 --> 4043.0789999999997
because I really have this tendency to

4039.869 --> 4045.15
do that always like like a neurotic

4043.079 --> 4047.9100000000003
autistic person that's just very

4045.15 --> 4049.65
enthusiastic added now I'm that sounds

4047.91 --> 4052.8289999999997
much worse than it really is in reality

4049.65 --> 4055.619
but I have this tendency to be very

4052.829 --> 4059.46
reactive and just put a lot of energy

4055.619 --> 4061.829
and focus in to my reactions so yeah if

4059.46 --> 4063.2690000000002
you have that insight you know that you

4061.829 --> 4064.9100000000003
know a lot more much yourself than most

4063.269 --> 4069.5089999999996
people know about themselves so that's

4064.91 --> 4073.319
awesome honesty and truth and up facing

4069.509 --> 4076.2
the music also just showing it just be

4073.319 --> 4078.63
unprotected and just expect expect

4076.2 --> 4080.3089999999997
attacks and people that are embarrassed

4078.63 --> 4082.2000000000003
or that are trying to peer pressure you

4080.309 --> 4084.349
at that so what happens it happens to me

4082.2 --> 4088.1699999999996
all the time since I've done this show

4084.349 --> 4090.809
and before even so I'm getting used to

4088.17 --> 4093.7200000000003
it and it's weird because in in a way

4090.809 --> 4096.4800000000005
when I was in school much younger I kind

4093.72 --> 4098.009
of also did that in when there wasn't

4096.48 --> 4100.3189999999995
even a time when there wasn't internet

4098.009 --> 4102.509
and oh my god did they freaking bully me

4100.319 --> 4105.839000000001
for it and eventually it became too much

4102.509 --> 4107.699
to handle for me but right back then I

4105.839 --> 4112.5599999999995
was kind of doing the same thing just

4107.699 --> 4115.3189999999995
being brutally but not unpolite ly

4112.56 --> 4117.4800000000005
honest and just bring up taboo subjects

4115.319 --> 4119.31
and then immediately reason and delve

4117.48 --> 4121.919999999999
into them and P some people were just

4119.31 --> 4124.339000000001
shocked that I did that and some even

4121.92 --> 4129.779
said like oh that guy is evil and

4124.339 --> 4132.42
because they questioned things yeah it

4129.779 --> 4135.4800000000005
happens and yeah you you're a great guy

4132.42 --> 4136.75
too I respect a lot of your your

4135.48 --> 4141.8099999999995
theories and your

4136.75 --> 4145.06
concepts they do seem very sensible and

4141.81 --> 4148.870000000001
well put together it's a very very broad

4145.06 --> 4152.71
spectrum well tied in system of how you

4148.87 --> 4155.41
have you've reasoned out the path

4152.71 --> 4157.42
basically in but there's still someone

4155.41 --> 4158.889999999999
you want to do it so it's not somebody

4157.42 --> 4160.509
came overnight that's for sure no yeah I

4158.89 --> 4164.71
said because how long have you been

4160.509 --> 4166.83
studying into the Scriptures the

4164.71 --> 4171.43
scriptures I've been studying for

4166.83 --> 4174.2789999999995
probably I guess I'd call it seven years

4171.43 --> 4177.009
the last five years have been the most

4174.279 --> 4181.63
intense with two of those years being

4177.009 --> 4183.339
almost an everyday thing so well one

4181.63 --> 4187.08
year was almost an everyday thing so if

4183.339 --> 4189.43
you the way it was equated to me was I

4187.08 --> 4192.64
didn't realize one day that I had read

4189.43 --> 4196.39
every day for seven six days a week

4192.64 --> 4198.1900000000005
everyday eight hours a day which equates

4196.39 --> 4202.09
to almost seven years worth of college

4198.19 --> 4203.32
oh man that's some stunning oh [ __ ] I

4202.09 --> 4205.68
didn't I had really actually the father

4203.32 --> 4210.219999999999
pointed out to me unless you've actually

4205.68 --> 4212.650000000001
spent more time in study in the

4210.22 --> 4214.39
scripture than most pastors and I'm not

4212.65 --> 4216.099999999999
saying that I'm better than Pastor

4214.39 --> 4218.610000000001
that's not what I'm saying I'm just

4216.1 --> 4220.96
saying I wanted the truth so badly I

4218.61 --> 4222.759999999999
literally lost track of time

4220.96 --> 4225.54
yeah I was studying yeah you were

4222.76 --> 4228.820000000001
totally into it yeah that's amazing

4225.54 --> 4231.22
so well you really wanted to get it and

4228.82 --> 4233.32
it does seem like you have some very

4231.22 --> 4234.9400000000005
good oversight there so I'm definitely

4233.32 --> 4237.61
gonna try to test it some more in the

4234.94 --> 4239.29
