super thick cloudy there's still some

148.62 --> 152.81900000000002
blue sky that you can see in between but

150.9 --> 155.0

[Music]

246.959 --> 249.98
very very long

251.159 --> 255.48
and

253.98 --> 257.519
later

255.48 --> 260.88
like much later I didn't watch it live

257.519 --> 263.22
because it was just too late but uh kiwi

260.88 --> 266.46
also did another QE live

263.22 --> 268.08000000000004
review which was like five hours as well

266.46 --> 271.38
so yeah

268.08 --> 274.4

I'd say yesterday

274.78 --> 282.26
[Music]

282.5 --> 287.6
foreign oh yeah also that was kind of

286.139 --> 292.08
funny yesterday

287.6 --> 294.47900000000004
flatzoid had RV on well after like three

292.08 --> 298.02
attempts because constantly his sound

294.479 --> 301.08
was uh not working and all that

298.02 --> 303.35999999999996
but it was kind of hilarious to see RV

301.08 --> 305.88
doing his thing on flat side and flat

303.36 --> 308.47900000000004
sawing being like Oh yeah yeah

305.88 --> 310.4
it's like uh

308.479 --> 313.25899999999996
yeah yeah

310.4 --> 315.9
not really I mean he was basically just

313.259 --> 318.18
doing his weird geometry correlation

315.9 --> 321.56
[ __ ]

318.18 --> 321.56
going full RV

321.82 --> 325.339
[Music]

327.78 --> 332.46
right but I didn't want to shame him in

330.419 --> 334.139
that moment I mean RV at least seems to

332.46 --> 336.78
be

334.139 --> 340.62
in recognition of the situation with

336.78 --> 342.59999999999997
globusters and is siding with us

340.62 --> 345.0
mostly good for him

342.6 --> 347.90000000000003
[Music]

345.0 --> 347.9
but yeah

350.34 --> 353.34
foreign

355.74 --> 359.18
so that was going on yesterday

365.69 --> 369.339
[Music]

379.86 --> 384.38
hey PG CNET good to see you

385.5 --> 387.68
foreign

399.199 --> 402.319
or anything

408.12 --> 412.68
I still have a Gusto energy drink from

410.699 --> 414.84000000000003
like months ago

412.68 --> 416.759
that then like the weather changed

414.84 --> 419.9
around and never really got to it so I

416.759 --> 419.90000000000003
might just take some of that

420.479 --> 425.15999999999997
of course green tea usual

426.3 --> 429.51
what is the temperature anyway it feels

428.46 --> 432.589
kind of cool

429.51 --> 432.589
[Music]

434.4 --> 440.35999999999996
12 degrees Celsius yeah yeah warm it is

438.12 --> 440.36
not

448.38 --> 454.44
it says it's going to be sunny or sort

452.28 --> 456.479
of partially Sunny this weekend looking

454.44 --> 460.039
forward to that at least

456.479 --> 460.039
that's actually going to happen

460.12 --> 470.04
[Music]

472.27 --> 475.74
[Music]

477.539 --> 481.81899999999996
right so yeah what have you guys been up

479.699 --> 481.819
to

487.08 --> 493.52
any feedback on my show from yesterday

490.8 --> 493.52000000000004
foreign

494.34 --> 497.599
it was a bit short

508.139 --> 512.4590000000001
yeah Tony Whitcomb yeah it was very good

510.18 --> 514.14
I mean Nathan was just straight to a

512.459 --> 517.5
point

514.14 --> 520.74
and it and it really did look that bad I

517.5 --> 522.839
mean I and to be fair they've looked

520.74 --> 525.42
that bad

522.839 --> 527.7
for a very long time

525.42 --> 530.0999999999999
because this is not like the an isolated

527.7 --> 532.86
incident where they they just

530.1 --> 534.839
fumble like all hell

532.86 --> 536.58
during some debate with the Flat Earth

534.839 --> 538.82
it's not the first time this has

536.58 --> 538.82
happened

539.22 --> 546.5400000000001
to be fair I've never actually seen them

542.279 --> 551.16
go up against any baller

546.54 --> 553.5
and do good I've never seen that in

551.16 --> 555.36
eight years

553.5 --> 559.82
never

555.36 --> 559.82
it's always stumbling around

560.76 --> 564.56
trying to sort of be social

565.019 --> 569.94
and useless

568.14 --> 573.18
so it's always been like that it's just

569.94 --> 575.7
now that basically it's been decided

573.18 --> 578.0999999999999
through the situation that now it's

575.7 --> 580.8000000000001
going to be taken on a loop

578.1 --> 581.97
again

580.8 --> 583.4399999999999
so

581.97 --> 586.2
[Music]

583.44 --> 589.1400000000001
but they've always sucked this much they

586.2 --> 591.26
they really have

589.14 --> 591.26
thank you

592.88 --> 596.779
I mean

594.45 --> 600.1800000000001
[Music]

596.779 --> 601.4399999999999
maybe like Dave when he just when he's

600.18 --> 604.5
just alone

601.44 --> 606.899
against somebody else like time she for

604.5 --> 608.899
example he went on

606.899 --> 608.899
on

609.54 --> 615.36
uh Infowars I mean those times when I

612.72 --> 620.399
see David just going alone

615.36 --> 623.339
then he he's not super great but he's

620.399 --> 626.64
been like pretty decent then and even

623.339 --> 630.4200000000001
well would actually

626.64 --> 632.58
draw in fed arguments

630.42 --> 636.62
but I've really only seen him do that

632.58 --> 636.62
when he's just completely by himself

636.779 --> 642.36
because every time he's like with the

639.18 --> 644.519
guys he's just not good

642.36 --> 648.14
and neither is the rest

644.519 --> 648.14
so that's really stood out to me

649.86 --> 655.519
yeah look Brian guy yeah what Tony

652.38 --> 658.62
Whitcomb I have a very very strong

655.519 --> 662.519
unbacked though suspicion

658.62 --> 665.9590000000001
that that brine guy basically just

662.519 --> 665.9590000000001
like hired them

667.38 --> 672.36
I think they he paid the guy looked

670.32 --> 674.94
pretty freaking wealthy

672.36 --> 678.24
like he if you know what I mean it

674.94 --> 679.9200000000001
looked like he goes around

678.24 --> 682.5
and

679.92 --> 685.4399999999999
I think they they just like took a bribe

682.5 --> 688.32
to basically be stupid flat earthers I

685.44 --> 692.0400000000001
really think they did

688.32 --> 696.48
it was so utterly incompetent it's

692.04 --> 700.3199999999999
that's like Beyond oops it's utter

696.48 --> 702.1800000000001
failure like you can't fail that bad by

700.32 --> 704.0400000000001
accident

702.18 --> 706.3199999999999
yeah

704.04 --> 708.12
the brain is an experienced debater yes

706.32 --> 710.4590000000001
I know that's why I think he basically

708.12 --> 713.4590000000001
just bought

710.459 --> 717.4799999999999
flat earthers for his show

713.459 --> 719.8199999999999
in order to make him look smart

717.48 --> 723.24
I really think that it just everything

719.82 --> 726.86
about that that video feels like that

723.24 --> 726.86
everything about it

728.22 --> 737.08
does not seem natural in the slightest

732.18 --> 737.0799999999999
[Music]

738.66 --> 741.56
foreign

742.73 --> 745.84
[Music]

746.88 --> 750.959
so yeah that's what I think is part of

748.8 --> 753.24
their business model

750.959 --> 755.5189999999999
now

753.24 --> 758.339
yeah

755.519 --> 760.44
get paid by anti-flat earthers and

758.339 --> 762.12
Ballers and people that really like that

760.44 --> 765.6
[ __ ]

762.12 --> 768.6
to be the supposed more famous flatter

765.6 --> 771.899
there's two completely [ __ ] up so that

768.6 --> 774.0600000000001
all his audience are like oh we knew it

771.899 --> 776.339
we knew we should have stuck to this guy

774.06 --> 779.0699999999999
because he's a globber in these flat

776.339 --> 781.74
earthers are just idiots right I mean

779.07 --> 785.36
[Music]

781.74 --> 785.36
what do you guys think

787.5 --> 792.779
hey Susie yes

789.24 --> 794.1800000000001
good to see you it's been a while

822.0 --> 826.079
actually want to skip on the coffee

824.399 --> 829.16
just saying

826.079 --> 829.16
it's up to you though

831.839 --> 834.8000000000001
anyway

835.5 --> 839.579
all right

836.82 --> 843.12
because any type of excitotoxins does

839.579 --> 846.909
not help a toothache just saying

843.12 --> 846.909
[Music]

864.66 --> 871.16
any feedback guys or are you just

867.42 --> 871.16

I mean I don't exactly have like a

873.899 --> 879.0
full-on subject to talk about I'm not

876.42 --> 881.66
gonna like spend two hours just rambling

879.0 --> 881.66
about this

882.66 --> 887.04
I feel like 10 minutes is just good

886.079 --> 890.04
enough

887.04 --> 894.98
unless there's a lot of feedback

890.04 --> 894.98
that I can basically expound upon

895.079 --> 899.659
foreign

896.46 --> 899.659
[Music]

907.8 --> 912.8399999999999

[Music]

914.94 --> 919.47

well sleep with one eye open good to see

935.459 --> 937.579

946.26 --> 952.199

948.839 --> 953.519
oh oh that reminds me that reminds me

952.199 --> 956.0
LSG

953.519 --> 959.88
remember my

956.0 --> 963.6
Miracle remedy against toothache against

959.88 --> 965.18
the aches specifically remember remember

963.6 --> 970.1990000000001
[Music]

965.18 --> 971.88
magnesium magnetic magnesium right

970.199 --> 975.26
two seconds

971.88 --> 978.779
put it in a little water and then just

975.26 --> 982.62
rinse it in your mouth

978.779 --> 986.3389999999999
works like it does it can do a miracle I

982.62 --> 989.579
know yeah the clove oil and all that

986.339 --> 992.8800000000001
yeah clove oil but that's really more

989.579 --> 995.88
like yeah if it's already really bad if

992.88 --> 998.1
it's like fully inflamed and [ __ ]

995.88 --> 1000.56
and not going away

998.1 --> 1002.66
right but you might want to try out the

1000.56 --> 1005.4799999999999
Magnesium powder

1002.66 --> 1008.199
especially if it's if it's only just now

1005.48 --> 1008.1990000000001
popping up

1010.94 --> 1017.1800000000001
always fully underway

1013.94 --> 1018.86
then yeah then it might help for a

1017.18 --> 1021.68
little bit and then just go back again

1018.86 --> 1024.74
so but if it's only just like at the

1021.68 --> 1026.72
beginning it might really help a lot I

1024.74 --> 1029.1200000000001
know from experience I literally figure

1026.72 --> 1030.8600000000001
that out on my show as I was having

1029.12 --> 1034.059
toothache

1030.86 --> 1034.059
so yeah

1035.36 --> 1037.24
glad

1036.679 --> 1040.7800000000002
that

1037.24 --> 1040.78
I remember that

1042.74 --> 1048.559
yeah yeah glad just yeah glad you

1044.959 --> 1049.46
already have that it's very convenient

1048.559 --> 1050.52

1049.46 --> 1053.24
good luck

1050.52 --> 1055.6399999999999
[Music]

1053.24 --> 1058.7
besides a little extra magnesium is

1055.64 --> 1060.679
never bad so it's always good to have

1058.7 --> 1061.93
some of that

1060.679 --> 1065.13
uh

1061.93 --> 1065.13
[Music]

1072.32 --> 1076.9399999999998
it's four times cheaper than UK not much

1074.84 --> 1079.4599999999998
more in Russia

1076.94 --> 1083.679
right yeah but in the UK it's even

1079.46 --> 1083.679
artificially being kept low

1093.98 --> 1100.059
so I don't know exactly like where the

1096.14 --> 1100.0590000000002
UK would be getting its power from

1102.44 --> 1105.44
foreign

1114.2 --> 1119.6000000000001
yeah and besides we just seen it I mean

1117.08 --> 1120.6789999999999
the electricity getting more expensive

1119.6 --> 1123.62
is not

1120.679 --> 1126.14
because of like green policies it's a

1123.62 --> 1129.02
deliberate shutdown

1126.14 --> 1132.2
it's a sabotage of the energy industry

1129.02 --> 1134.36
sector it's a sabotage this is not a

1132.2 --> 1139.5800000000002
green policy

1134.36 --> 1142.299
right a green policy would have an equal

1139.58 --> 1142.299
replacement

1142.46 --> 1148.94
in order for everything not to collapse

1144.62 --> 1151.28
they don't so it's not a policy it's a

1148.94 --> 1154.46
sabotage it's

1151.28 --> 1157.48
energy industrial sabotage

1154.46 --> 1157.48
from the top down

1164.42 --> 1172.76
[Music]

1170.539 --> 1175.7
without my twin power to the wind farms

1172.76 --> 1177.5
yeah it's completely useless

1175.7 --> 1179.6200000000001
I mean those things don't work in the

1177.5 --> 1179.62
winter

1179.96 --> 1184.64
in the winter there's like if there's

1181.94 --> 1187.76
actual like frost and snow there's only

1184.64 --> 1189.98
one thing that really works

1187.76 --> 1193.46
and that's

1189.98 --> 1194.84
well would they like to designate fossil

1193.46 --> 1198.82
fuels

1194.84 --> 1198.82
Cole gas

1200.78 --> 1203.78
gasoline

1204.98 --> 1208.82
that's what really works in the winter

1206.78 --> 1210.86
and that's what it should be for right I

1208.82 --> 1213.08
mean yeah sure do you use your wind

1210.86 --> 1215.4189999999999
power and the

1213.08 --> 1219.32
solar energy why not

1215.419 --> 1221.7800000000002
but yeah do use it when that works as

1219.32 --> 1223.6399999999999
like a supplement

1221.78 --> 1225.98
you can't

1223.64 --> 1229.7
suggest

1225.98 --> 1233.24
that you can that you can go off those

1229.7 --> 1236.6000000000001
things exclusively all year long

1233.24 --> 1239.02
that is an infeasible model that anybody

1236.6 --> 1244.12
that actually works in the energy sector

1239.02 --> 1244.12
knows it is complete harsh [ __ ]

1245.179 --> 1248.919
everybody knows that

1249.86 --> 1258.4499999999998
that has half a lick of sense about it

[Music]

1280.039 --> 1283.039
foreign

1290.32 --> 1294.1
yeah yeah you know

1294.62 --> 1299.26
you know what would make a great green

1296.6 --> 1299.26
policy

1299.299 --> 1305.84
if they didn't push everybody in poverty

1302.84 --> 1308.1789999999999
by cutting off resources and making

1305.84 --> 1310.58
everything expensive through their

1308.179 --> 1314.14
stupid pointless trade Wars based on

1310.58 --> 1314.1399999999999
false premises and lies

1314.48 --> 1321.679
well then a lot of people wouldn't be

1318.7 --> 1325.1000000000001
so desperate that they would simply

1321.679 --> 1329.0
ignore Environmental

guidelines just to be able to [ __ ]

1329.0 --> 1331.52
survive

1330.2 --> 1333.74
yeah

1331.52 --> 1338.6589999999999
because you know what what actually

1333.74 --> 1340.94
causes environmental damage desperation

1338.659 --> 1342.6200000000001
why don't you look it up

1340.94 --> 1344.559
why don't you look up how that works

1342.62 --> 1348.08
yeah I mean people

1344.559 --> 1351.02
naturally most of them anyway would love

1348.08 --> 1353.6589999999999
to take care of nature if you can't

1351.02 --> 1356.96
[ __ ] feed your kids

1353.659 --> 1360.0800000000002
if everybody's just like freezing

1356.96 --> 1362.659
because the power is off and you're not

1360.08 --> 1365.78
allowed to turn on heating or burn wood

1362.659 --> 1368.5390000000002
yeah guess what guess what those people

1365.78 --> 1371.1789999999999
are gonna say [ __ ] you and [ __ ] your

1368.539 --> 1372.919
nature we're gonna do whatever it takes

1371.179 --> 1375.5
even if that means that I'm literally

1372.919 --> 1380.3200000000002
just cutting the trees in the middle of

1375.5 --> 1380.32
the street okay that's what would happen

1382.7 --> 1388.64
so these supposed green policies are

1386.299 --> 1391.34
actually Marxist they're the exact

1388.64 --> 1394.0
opposite they're anti-green policies

1391.34 --> 1397.3999999999999
they destroy

1394.0 --> 1401.26
nature cherishing and caretaking culture

1397.4 --> 1404.48
that's what they do

1401.26 --> 1406.8799999999999
everywhere they're implemented

1404.48 --> 1409.88
everywhere they're implemented

1406.88 --> 1411.98
the people at the start of it thought

1409.88 --> 1414.2
maybe like oh wow we're getting even

1411.98 --> 1417.26
Greener well we're already so green so

1414.2 --> 1419.3600000000001
we'll see and now they're noticing oh so

1417.26 --> 1421.28
now everything is just getting stripped

1419.36 --> 1424.2199999999998
away from us

1421.28 --> 1425.299
but we wear green why are you doing this

1424.22 --> 1427.82
to us

1425.299 --> 1431.26
now you're just destroying it all again

1427.82 --> 1433.1589999999999
yeah that's what they do yeah

1431.26 --> 1436.82
blackouts

1433.159 --> 1440.8400000000001
extreme electricity gas prices yeah

1436.82 --> 1443.08
that's environmental destruction in the

1440.84 --> 1443.08
making

1443.61 --> 1455.799
[Music]

1457.28 --> 1461.78
that partial solar eclipse how is that

1459.919 --> 1465.74
possible it's very simple it's called

1461.78 --> 1467.6589999999999
the astrological Cycles which are very

1465.74 --> 1470.48
mathematical

1467.659 --> 1472.8200000000002
and thus you can basically just keep

1470.48 --> 1476.179
moving the circles moving the circles

1472.82 --> 1477.98
think of a more easy to and visualized

1476.179 --> 1480.26
system to compare it with would be like

1477.98 --> 1483.38
a Mayan calendar right which is based on

1480.26 --> 1485.84
Cycles well all you do is just use that

1483.38 --> 1488.2990000000002
keep on moving and then you can

1485.84 --> 1490.1589999999999
literally point it out oh like hey

1488.299 --> 1493.46
it matches

1490.159 --> 1496.3400000000001
is it genius no no he wasn't a genius he

1493.46 --> 1499.82
was a [ __ ] [ __ ] who barely knew

1496.34 --> 1501.1399999999999
anything about anything except for math

1499.82 --> 1504.4399999999998
yeah

1501.14 --> 1508.159
he was not a genius he was a [ __ ]

1504.44 --> 1510.6200000000001
[ __ ] and a liar and a pervert

1508.159 --> 1513.7600000000002
yeah now just because he actually

1510.62 --> 1517.58
managed to listen to some astrologer

1513.76 --> 1520.7
about the celestial Cycles

1517.58 --> 1523.8799999999999
doesn't make you a genius

1520.7 --> 1525.5
I mean I can literally like

1523.88 --> 1527.779
or might take some effort maybe even

1525.5 --> 1530.84
money I could look up some astrologer

1527.779 --> 1532.539
and just ask like oh when is the next

1530.84 --> 1535.6399999999999
moon

1532.539 --> 1538.82
what is it uh

1535.64 --> 1543.0800000000002
solar eclipse whatever

1538.82 --> 1545.779
and just say like yeah in the year 2040

1543.08 --> 1548.8999999999999
there is this thing coming does that

1545.779 --> 1552.2
make me a genius no it made me simply

1548.9 --> 1554.659
look up an astrologer who can easily

1552.2 --> 1556.7
through the standard cycles of the

1554.659 --> 1557.779
celestials predict when these things

1556.7 --> 1561.02
happen

1557.779 --> 1563.539
it's not that mind-boggling all you need

1561.02 --> 1566.62
to know is astrology

1563.539 --> 1566.62
that's all

1567.14 --> 1572.419
doesn't take a genius

1570.38 --> 1575.679
that was many years ago yeah yeah yeah

1572.419 --> 1580.039
and I bet that Nostradamus or whatever

1575.679 --> 1583.279
probably predicted such things of 500

1580.039 --> 1586.059
years ago no not astronomy you [ __ ]

1583.279 --> 1589.52
[ __ ] astrology

1586.059 --> 1593.02
astronomy is a fraud

1589.52 --> 1593.02
it doesn't predict anything

1594.14 --> 1603.6200000000001
it's just a stupid 3D [ __ ] projected

1597.86 --> 1605.9599999999998
over the actual 2D map of the celestials

1603.62 --> 1608.4799999999998
which is a 2d map

1605.96 --> 1610.4
like a sphere around us and I will call

1608.48 --> 1613.4
you a [ __ ] [ __ ] because that's what

1610.4 --> 1617.5590000000002
you are for bringing up astronomy like a

1613.4 --> 1617.5590000000002
damn it like a dumbass Glover

1617.72 --> 1623.08
now you can get the [ __ ] out

you call that a genius a man

1885.86 --> 1890.4799999999998
curious at these things I mean we don't

1890.48 --> 1897.559
these things for us you know

1893.2 --> 1900.2
so we kind of have to like do the do the

it's great to have a completely new

if not too much you don't need to know

2037.6 --> 2042.279
every detail but like what part of the

2039.94 --> 2044.56
country are you in the Netherlands or

2042.279 --> 2047.77
are you just Dutch born

2044.56 --> 2047.77
[Music]

2051.52 --> 2056.139
I'm in the dead center of the

2053.379 --> 2056.7599999999998
Netherlands in Utrecht so that's where I

2056.139 --> 2059.9190000000003
am

2056.76 --> 2059.9190000000003

2073.96 --> 2079.02
feel comfortable doing so just yet don't

2076.419 --> 2079.02

2080.379 --> 2082.919

2086.139 --> 2089.559
[Music]

2091.74 --> 2095.9799999999996
okay so you've been actually looking

2094.419 --> 2098.5499999999997

it's very Dutch if you oh man

2098.55 --> 2102.82
[Music]

2100.9 --> 2106.32
I know where that is

2102.82 --> 2106.32
it's in the northwest

2108.4 --> 2111.78
I've been there a few times

2112.78 --> 2118.44

2118.45 --> 2122.879
[Music]

2126.7 --> 2134.16
oh wait no no no no no this is in the

2131.32 --> 2134.1600000000003
there yeah yeah

2134.44 --> 2138.82
east of Amsterdam north of Utrecht

2136.78 --> 2140.38
you're actually kind of close to me all

2138.82 --> 2142.48
right

2140.38 --> 2145.3
just mixing it up with the old Kumar I

2142.48 --> 2148.68
typically do that

2145.3 --> 2148.6800000000003
all right cool

2149.02 --> 2166.999
please hold on yep the Big polder Island

2153.55 --> 2166.9990000000003
[Music]

2169.66 --> 2171.839
thank you

2173.82 --> 2177.599
right yeah but what

2178.119 --> 2183.099
what are you into why why have you gone

2180.94 --> 2185.14
searching basically because you don't

2183.099 --> 2187.3590000000004
remember where you started but

2185.14 --> 2188.44
if you're if you've been going for a

2187.359 --> 2190.72
while

2188.44 --> 2193.119
then what basically you should remember

2190.72 --> 2196.2
like what made you start I mean first

2193.119 --> 2199.78
time I truly snapped out of

2196.2 --> 2202.96
the ball dream like on a more permanent

2199.78 --> 2205.0
note was in 2015 and I can never forget

2202.96 --> 2207.7400000000002
how that happened to me because it's in

2205.0 --> 2210.79
a way kind of traumatizing at first

2207.74 --> 2210.79
[Music]

2216.52 --> 2223.3
so you've always had like trouble with

2219.82 --> 2226.1800000000003
globe stories or

2223.3 --> 2228.579
or were you just really interested in

2226.18 --> 2229.96
seeing like Flat Earth models or

2228.579 --> 2232.119
something because that's how it started

2229.96 --> 2236.339
with me even as a little kid like I was

2232.119 --> 2239.26
always like Baldwin basically really

2236.339 --> 2242.5
I have been

2239.26 --> 2245.2000000000003
I'd say I've had I've been bowling more

2242.5 --> 2246.7
than half my life right

2245.2 --> 2249.3999999999996
don't know if you know what that means

2246.7 --> 2251.4399999999996
but the guys will know it's me being

2249.4 --> 2254.619
like a baller I still act like a baller

2251.44 --> 2257.8
sometimes under very specific conditions

2254.619 --> 2259.839
right that'll never be like oh I believe

2257.8 --> 2263.46
in the ball now it's not a flat Earth

2259.839 --> 2263.46
that that's never gonna happen again

2264.28 --> 2268.0600000000004
but uh

2265.66 --> 2269.02
for me even as a little kid it started

2268.06 --> 2269.95
by

2269.02 --> 2271.119
like

2269.95 --> 2274.0
[Music]

2271.119 --> 2276.6400000000003
it actually started my curiosity about

2274.0 --> 2279.16
flat earth when for the first time I was

2276.64 --> 2282.16
like in a class where that was treated

2279.16 --> 2284.6189999999997
and then the teacher shoved a picture of

2282.16 --> 2287.2
a flat Earth with a like a flat earth

2284.619 --> 2289.7200000000003
type snow globe in my face

2287.2 --> 2291.5789999999997
not the stupid flatter Society disc

2289.72 --> 2293.0789999999997
without a dome and [ __ ] because that

2291.579 --> 2295.6600000000003
thing is just [ __ ] it's not

2293.079 --> 2299.079
inspiring at all but just like an actual

2295.66 --> 2302.0789999999997
like a fantasy drawing sort of

2299.079 --> 2304.119
of a flat Earth Mountains and the Dome

2302.079 --> 2306.28
and I was like oh what is that I want to

2304.119 --> 2307.96
see more that's so beautiful

2306.28 --> 2310.1800000000003
and then the teacher was like oh how

2307.96 --> 2314.14
dare you that's stupid you should that's

2310.18 --> 2316.2999999999997
stupid it's a ball you shouldn't yeah it

2314.14 --> 2318.7
got really upset because I was really

2316.3 --> 2322.0600000000004
inspired by just that one picture that's

2318.7 --> 2325.3799999999997
honestly where it started

2322.06 --> 2325.38
because I just liked

2326.859 --> 2332.92
like things that were considered a bit

2329.68 --> 2336.0989999999997
surreal I like like even the ideas of

2332.92 --> 2338.079
like oh floating islands in a in a sky

2336.099 --> 2339.6400000000003
world right I always thought that was

2338.079 --> 2342.04
really awesome

2339.64 --> 2344.56
really fantastical

2342.04 --> 2345.94
so that is in a way kind of what drew me

2344.56 --> 2347.68
to it

2345.94 --> 2350.2000000000003
[Music]

2347.68 --> 2353.68
only later to find out of course the

2350.2 --> 2358.24
very bizarre truth

2353.68 --> 2363.1189999999997
that that is actually

2358.24 --> 2363.1189999999997
closer to our reality

2363.22 --> 2368.4399999999996
like that is the real weird part that's

2366.22 --> 2372.24
the part where your mind gets boggled by

2368.44 --> 2372.2400000000002
it once you figure that out

2372.4 --> 2375.599
that is long ago

2376.42 --> 2381.66
well for me it's long ago it's like when

2379.06 --> 2381.66
I was six

2382.06 --> 2386.339
so that's like 36 years ago

2393.16 --> 2398.64
are you a bit of an art type you're a

2395.92 --> 2398.64
painter or something

2405.82 --> 2411.8300000000004
or you just like that style

2410.14 --> 2414.8799999999997
I don't know

2411.83 --> 2414.88
[Music]

2415.839 --> 2419.2799999999997
anyway yeah good to have you here

2422.339 --> 2426.2999999999997
yes you are a painter

2434.98 --> 2440.98
huh

2437.98 --> 2440.98
foreign

2446.26 --> 2452.8
I collect painters

2449.94 --> 2455.16
because the fiber oats here is also a

2452.8 --> 2455.1600000000003
painter

2455.5 --> 2458.339
did you know that

2465.16 --> 2467.8199999999997
cool

2468.18 --> 2474.94
all right okay well

2471.4 --> 2477.4300000000003
if you stick around I hope that I can

2474.94 --> 2479.68
give you some interesting ideas

2477.43 --> 2482.3799999999997
[Music]

2479.68 --> 2485.3199999999997
it's kind of what I like to do just

2482.38 --> 2488.92
let my mind go to places where people

2485.32 --> 2491.38
don't usually think of to go

2488.92 --> 2494.44
and then use my

2491.38 --> 2496.78
my oratory skills to basically put it

2494.44 --> 2498.2200000000003
down and translate it

2496.78 --> 2500.8590000000004
so that

2498.22 --> 2504.16
it's more palatable for other peace

2500.859 --> 2507.04
people to Envision just from what I'm

2504.16 --> 2509.14
describing like one of my more proud

2507.04 --> 2512.2599999999998
examples for example would be like from

2509.14 --> 2513.8199999999997
a few days ago at a show it was just a

2512.26 --> 2515.8
little segment so you have to like

2513.82 --> 2518.32
really catch those moments it's not like

2515.8 --> 2521.5600000000004
oh I got a great concept I'm now gonna

2518.32 --> 2523.599
spend one hour just about that one

2521.56 --> 2525.099
concept continually that's not how I do

2523.599 --> 2527.619
it it's just like I stumble upon

2525.099 --> 2531.46
something that I immediately like it's

2527.619 --> 2533.56
like quick dick and just get to get the

2531.46 --> 2535.119
gems Bing there it is and then move on

2533.56 --> 2537.22
that's kind of how I tend to do it

2535.119 --> 2539.44
unless well the gem that I find is

2537.22 --> 2542.02
really inspiring to me personally and I

2539.44 --> 2543.94
can figure out more things with it

2542.02 --> 2545.8
but that's usually how I do it but

2543.94 --> 2547.18
recently what I was really impressed

2545.8 --> 2549.82
about was the

2547.18 --> 2551.3799999999997
conception of what would happen

2549.82 --> 2554.92
if

2551.38 --> 2558.2200000000003
an Explorer an actual real Explorer

2554.92 --> 2561.46
that's like Fearless

2558.22 --> 2563.74
would go down for example in Bulgaria in

2561.46 --> 2565.96
the giant caves there and just keep

2563.74 --> 2567.8199999999997
going down and keep going down until

2565.96 --> 2569.98
they like

2567.82 --> 2572.44
get to the bottom

2569.98 --> 2575.32
I mean nobody even knows how far those

2572.44 --> 2578.319
tunnels go down it's likely that they go

2575.32 --> 2580.6600000000003
farther down than the cola deep borehole

2578.319 --> 2583.119
in Russia was ever Doug

2580.66 --> 2585.7
it's likely that it will go further down

2583.119 --> 2588.579
and there's also been well Fantastical

2585.7 --> 2591.16
you could say speculation about how it

2588.579 --> 2594.28
might lead to another world

2591.16 --> 2595.7799999999997
right so what if you keep climbing down

2594.28 --> 2598.96
in those caves

2595.78 --> 2603.4
and then eventually you get a great big

2598.96 --> 2606.16
Black Chasm it would absolutely seem

2603.4 --> 2607.0
like it's the abyss or something like a

2606.16 --> 2609.2799999999997
big

2607.0 --> 2611.74
hole

2609.28 --> 2613.96
like a cave you get there and it's like

2611.74 --> 2614.859
a big hole and the hole is it's just

2613.96 --> 2618.579
black

2614.859 --> 2622.06
and then like you might throw like a

2618.579 --> 2624.579
like a lamp or a flashlight that or uh

2622.06 --> 2627.4
like one of those Smoky uh torches

2624.579 --> 2628.9
things right throw them down there and

2627.4 --> 2630.7000000000003
it'll just keep going and going and

2628.9 --> 2633.64
going and going and going and going not

2630.7 --> 2635.2599999999998
lighting up anything around it until it

2633.64 --> 2638.3799999999997
just literally you don't see the light

2635.26 --> 2641.1400000000003
anymore it just like a forever hole and

2638.38 --> 2643.1800000000003
it's just pure black right well if an

2641.14 --> 2645.2799999999997
Explorer would be brave enough to then

2643.18 --> 2648.339
actually start to descend there right

2645.28 --> 2649.3
well bring good climbing equipment or I

2648.339 --> 2652.48
don't know

2649.3 --> 2655.2400000000002
build a really reliable elevator that

2652.48 --> 2659.5
could go on forever

2655.24 --> 2661.5989999999997
like an elevator that has like cables

2659.5 --> 2663.94
for like a hundred miles or something

2661.599 --> 2666.4
crazy like that because you never know

2663.94 --> 2668.8
and then they would like either climb

2666.4 --> 2670.96
down or go through the lift after it's

2668.8 --> 2674.26
installed and it's just like like

2670.96 --> 2676.66
ascending into a pure black Blackness

2674.26 --> 2679.2400000000002
it's just black it's like oh so scary

2676.66 --> 2681.52
think of I don't know if you've seen it

2679.24 --> 2684.3999999999996
Time Bandits the old

2681.52 --> 2685.119
old movie from the 80s Monty Python

2684.4 --> 2688.0
movie

2685.119 --> 2690.2200000000003
or Monty Python oriented there had was

2688.0 --> 2693.819
this scene where they were basically in

2690.22 --> 2696.8799999999997
in the hell sort of the helmet of fiery

2693.819 --> 2698.92
hell where they were hanging in a cage

2696.88 --> 2701.02
in the middle of black and there was

2698.92 --> 2703.78
only black well that would be kind of

2701.02 --> 2704.7
what it would feel like really [ __ ]

2703.78 --> 2707.2000000000003
scary

2704.7 --> 2709.54
because you don't know what you don't

2707.2 --> 2711.7599999999998
even know how deep it is it might be

2709.54 --> 2714.04
forever or something right but then

2711.76 --> 2716.8590000000004
anyway you go down on that lift or you

2714.04 --> 2719.8
climb down and then you look keep

2716.859 --> 2722.859
looking around it at some point suddenly

2719.8 --> 2725.5
really unexpectedly you start to notice

2722.859 --> 2728.2
that below you

2725.5 --> 2732.28
there's like this weird blue

2728.2 --> 2734.14
blue vague Shimmer like a blue

2732.28 --> 2735.7000000000003
blanket or something right it's like

2734.14 --> 2737.3799999999997
what is that

2735.7 --> 2739.96
like huh

2737.38 --> 2742.06
why am I seeing a fake blue light there

2739.96 --> 2744.88
and then you keep going and then the

2742.06 --> 2747.22
blue starts to become brighter and

2744.88 --> 2750.4
brighter and suddenly it's starting to

2747.22 --> 2753.16
remind you of like way

2750.4 --> 2756.4
is that Earth

2753.16 --> 2759.04
because it starts to remind you of like

2756.4 --> 2762.46
balloon footage high up

2759.04 --> 2764.619
right it's all black up there but below

2762.46 --> 2767.7400000000002
there's this the Blue Earth

2764.619 --> 2771.04
and yeah the further you go down the

2767.74 --> 2773.9799999999996
more lit up the blue part becomes until

2771.04 --> 2775.18
it literally just starts to look like

2773.98 --> 2778.54
the Earth

2775.18 --> 2781.839
as you are descending to it from the sky

2778.54 --> 2784.48
and then yeah it might turn that there's

2781.839 --> 2787.0
just a whole new terrestrial layer

2784.48 --> 2789.839
underneath there and that there is a a

2787.0 --> 2793.0
doorway for example through

2789.839 --> 2795.04
Bulgaria through those tunnels and that

2793.0 --> 2796.9
you can literally just descend it down

2795.04 --> 2803.46
on another Realm

2796.9 --> 2803.46
or even weirder on the same Realm

2805.96 --> 2812.319
which would indicate a vertical Loop

2809.2 --> 2813.819
where you would basically go down

2812.319 --> 2817.599
if you manage to find a way through

2813.819 --> 2820.06
you'll literally descend

2817.599 --> 2822.88
from above

2820.06 --> 2824.859
so yeah hope that gives you some

2822.88 --> 2827.92
interesting inspiration I thought it was

2824.859 --> 2830.44
very interesting when I describe that

2827.92 --> 2832.06
the first time worthy enough to describe

2830.44 --> 2834.88
it a second time

2832.06 --> 2836.319
right and yeah if it's another realm not

2834.88 --> 2839.38
the same place you're descending back

2836.319 --> 2842.2599999999998
onto it could also be that the realm

2839.38 --> 2846.04
there might be tidier and that it

2842.26 --> 2848.92
doesn't have the same type of celestials

2846.04 --> 2850.7799999999997
yeah like not at all that there might

2848.92 --> 2852.579
not be a sun there there might be

2850.78 --> 2854.52
something that I've heard before through

2852.579 --> 2858.52
other people's stories

2854.52 --> 2858.83
a weird purplish Cloud that radiates

2858.52 --> 2862.17
light

2858.83 --> 2862.17
[Music]

2863.56 --> 2867.94
it might be there as well that's what

2865.839 --> 2870.04
you might start to see when you go down

2867.94 --> 2871.7200000000003
but I'm pretty certain that at first it

2870.04 --> 2874.599
would just be pure black you wouldn't

2871.72 --> 2876.339
see anything and then after descent you

2874.599 --> 2879.65
start like

2876.339 --> 2881.0789999999997
the ground basically starts to blow up

2879.65 --> 2883.839
[Music]

2881.079 --> 2886.2400000000002
to get blue very vaguely and then more

2883.839 --> 2888.16
pronounced until suddenly it just starts

2886.24 --> 2889.66
to look like well as if you were in a

2888.16 --> 2893.3999999999996
super high balloon

2889.66 --> 2893.3999999999996
that's what I believe would happen

2896.56 --> 2903.7799999999997
hey stop distracting Susan Baker I'm

2899.079 --> 2903.78
trying to talk to her fiber outs damn it

2922.0 --> 2926.859
ah

2923.59 --> 2929.28
[Music]

2926.859 --> 2931.319
time Benders

2929.28 --> 2936.4
yeah yeah

2931.319 --> 2941.46
time Benders was a pretty bizarre

2936.4 --> 2941.46
little TV segment for sure

2963.7 --> 2966.2999999999997
right

2967.31 --> 2972.8089999999997
[Music]

2974.2 --> 2980.0989999999997
this man see Guy

2977.079 --> 2980.099
Trace temperature

2987.7 --> 2991.66
I think that's just like a rough

2989.26 --> 2993.4
estimate though

2991.66 --> 2995.819
I mean it's not going to be like that

2993.4 --> 2995.819
everywhere

3020.22 --> 3027.14
a layer Earth like a fountain

3023.9 --> 3027.14
nah maybe

3034.85 --> 3038.94
[Music]

3036.72 --> 3043.2
no but what I'm talking about is

3038.94 --> 3047.059
basically compartments so look

3043.2 --> 3051.5989999999997
it's very likely that this Earth

3047.059 --> 3054.1800000000003
is not covered up by a round Dome to

3051.599 --> 3058.44
make it into a snow globe it's actually

3054.18 --> 3061.6189999999997
much more likely that it has a flat top

3058.44 --> 3064.14
so that effectively our available realm

3061.619 --> 3066.7400000000002
space is going to be like boxes it's

3064.14 --> 3066.74
like a box

3067.26 --> 3071.76
now

3068.819 --> 3076.2
there are other aspects about the realm

3071.76 --> 3078.7200000000003
that are kind of mind-boggling and

3076.2 --> 3082.02
defying because I have a strong

3078.72 --> 3084.72
suspicion that the nature of the realm

3082.02 --> 3089.4
content that we live in is not entirely

3084.72 --> 3091.2
linear you see I think there is

3089.4 --> 3093.92
a

3091.2 --> 3097.2599999999998
a nature in people

3093.92 --> 3100.14
that basically wants to make everything

3097.26 --> 3102.599
palatable to a degree where you can have

3100.14 --> 3105.66
a miniature version of it in your hand

3102.599 --> 3107.6400000000003
and then say this is it because why

3105.66 --> 3110.0989999999997
because I can have a miniature version

3107.64 --> 3112.6189999999997
in my hand right this is a very human

3110.099 --> 3115.2000000000003
tendency isn't it a lot of people feel

3112.619 --> 3117.119
very secure if they have a miniature of

3115.2 --> 3120.0
something

3117.119 --> 3122.4
that is palatable

3120.0 --> 3123.96
it gives them confidence about

3122.4 --> 3127.26
understanding

3123.96 --> 3129.96
something why physicality assumption

3127.26 --> 3131.88
bias it's a psychological effect that I

3129.96 --> 3133.859
basically discovered

3131.88 --> 3135.96
a few years ago

3133.859 --> 3139.319
through Flat Earth debating

3135.96 --> 3143.099
is the tendency of the Mind

3139.319 --> 3146.2799999999997
to assume per default that whatever

3143.099 --> 3150.3590000000004
you're looking at is purely a physical

3146.28 --> 3154.559
object and it starts with the celestials

3150.359 --> 3156.5989999999997
look at it say oh the sun oh it's a

3154.559 --> 3158.52
bright thing well what can be a bright

3156.599 --> 3161.4
thing the only thing I can think of is a

3158.52 --> 3163.98
lamp so it has to be a big ball

3161.4 --> 3166.02
of light that's hanging somewhere and

3163.98 --> 3169.559
that's what I'm seeing right that's a

3166.02 --> 3171.839
very logical process of thinking about

3169.559 --> 3174.96
it that most people follow in their

3171.839 --> 3176.94
minds if they even think about it at all

3174.96 --> 3181.68
but the problem is is that there's

3176.94 --> 3184.619
absolutely no proof or even leads

3181.68 --> 3187.5
that for example the sun is actually

3184.619 --> 3191.04
like a physical ball hanging in space

3187.5 --> 3193.319
Somewhere over the Earth or anywhere

3191.04 --> 3196.079
like a lamp there is no evidence of this

3193.319 --> 3199.5
whatsoever yet in our minds

3196.079 --> 3201.9
we make it like that because it's our

3199.5 --> 3204.24
mind's tendency and that's physicality

3201.9 --> 3206.339
assumption bias well this physicality

3204.24 --> 3208.9799999999996
assumption bias

3206.339 --> 3212.22
has more issues

3208.98 --> 3214.5
for example what the hell do you do if

3212.22 --> 3218.04
it turns out that the place you live in

3214.5 --> 3224.099
is rectangular looping

3218.04 --> 3228.119
like the Matrix 2 train man station C

3224.099 --> 3230.1600000000003
tunnel you run into the tunnel and then

3228.119 --> 3231.7200000000003
you literally end up where you started

3230.16 --> 3233.94
back

3231.72 --> 3236.4599999999996
moving in a straight line

3233.94 --> 3239.76
I have a very strong suspicion that this

3236.46 --> 3242.64
effect is inherent to our Realm

3239.76 --> 3244.98
in the east to west Direction

3242.64 --> 3247.6189999999997
and this is testable it is testable

3244.98 --> 3251.94
whether that is actually physically true

3247.619 --> 3253.7400000000002
or not if devised on how to proceed in

3251.94 --> 3256.38
figuring that out

3253.74 --> 3258.4799999999996
not gotten any actual confirmation yet

3256.38 --> 3262.02
but I definitely know on how to test it

3258.48 --> 3264.839
and once that's established

3262.02 --> 3269.16
to be real and I really think it is then

3264.839 --> 3272.7
that completely will Warp

3269.16 --> 3275.339
whatever model we're gonna we're gonna

3272.7 --> 3279.0
try to Envision it as because

3275.339 --> 3280.92
you can't make a miniature of a loop

3279.0 --> 3282.66
yeah how are you gonna are you gonna

3280.92 --> 3285.48
Loop that how are you gonna interconnect

3282.66 --> 3289.3799999999997
itself with itself in unfinished

3285.48 --> 3291.78
physical miniature we can't

3289.38 --> 3294.42
we cannot

3291.78 --> 3296.46
physicality assumption bias will be

3294.42 --> 3300.9
tough because

3296.46 --> 3303.96
will you accept what the Earth is if you

3300.9 --> 3307.02
can't have a miniature of exactly what

3303.96 --> 3309.359
you think it is in your hand

3307.02 --> 3312.559
yeah it's

3309.359 --> 3312.5589999999997
mental challenge

3312.77 --> 3315.82
[Music]

3319.98 --> 3324.119
let's know you've seen the secrets what

3322.319 --> 3324.6
you didn't know that turret I mean come

3324.119 --> 3327.059
on

3324.6 --> 3330.1189999999997
[Music]

3327.059 --> 3331.3190000000004
dude I saw the third Matrix movie in the

3330.119 --> 3334.92
theater

3331.319 --> 3337.2599999999998
and oh yeah oh oh oh and sorta proceeded

3334.92 --> 3339.42
to have a psychotic break after that by

3337.26 --> 3340.67
the way it was a really bad time

3339.42 --> 3343.789
actually for me

3340.67 --> 3343.789
[Music]

3344.64 --> 3352.3799999999997
I think it was right before I started

3348.18 --> 3355.5
to quit smoking cannabis in that time

3352.38 --> 3357.599
it was really bad time for me and like I

3355.5 --> 3361.619
did not like the ending of Matrix three

3357.599 --> 3364.2000000000003
at all I was like I was like hurt by it

3361.619 --> 3367.38
it's like what the [ __ ] are you doing

3364.2 --> 3370.2599999999998
this stupid Christ [ __ ]

3367.38 --> 3372.3
and when why didn't you create and make

3370.26 --> 3374.28
tricks in The Matrix why the hell didn't

3372.3 --> 3375.2400000000002
you do that Matrix

3374.28 --> 3376.619
you stupid

3375.24 --> 3379.859
[Music]

3376.619 --> 3382.5
asses they're [ __ ] [ __ ]

3379.859 --> 3385.7999999999997
why didn't you make another Matrix in

3382.5 --> 3387.66
The Matrix the end of Matrix two

3385.8 --> 3390.9
should have

3387.66 --> 3393.0589999999997
done that I mean he literally in the

3390.9 --> 3395.64
Machine World

3393.059 --> 3398.46
stopped a freaking squid

3395.64 --> 3400.44
why the hell didn't it turn out to be

3398.46 --> 3403.44
another Matrix

3400.44 --> 3406.38
it's such a wasted opportunity it was

3403.44 --> 3410.04
too much of a wasted opportunity it hurt

3406.38 --> 3412.02
me it hurt me that they didn't do that

3410.04 --> 3414.7799999999997
and I thought the third one

3412.02 --> 3417.119
as a movie as the choreography the

3414.78 --> 3419.099
fights and it was pretty cool I still

3417.119 --> 3420.78
even like like how the story developed

3419.099 --> 3423.3590000000004
it's just that

3420.78 --> 3425.099
I did not like the stupid Christ type

3423.359 --> 3427.7999999999997
ending

3425.099 --> 3430.98
I did not like that at all

3427.8 --> 3434.46
and they just wasted The Matrix within

3430.98 --> 3437.579
the Matrix opportunity it's such a waste

3434.46 --> 3439.98
it's like it's still a waste still right

3437.579 --> 3442.2000000000003
now it is

3439.98 --> 3446.04
and the funny thing is that they could

3442.2 --> 3447.8999999999996
these stupid asses Wachowski sisters or

3446.04 --> 3451.68
whatever the [ __ ] they are

3447.9 --> 3454.02
they could still do it right now

3451.68 --> 3456.1189999999997
but they're just not they're just not

3454.02 --> 3459.78
because they're more interested in being

3456.119 --> 3463.44
stupid [ __ ] and trendy and [ __ ]

3459.78 --> 3465.25
and delusional and spreading that around

3463.44 --> 3472.46
foreign

3465.25 --> 3476.46
[Music]

3472.46 --> 3480.55
film oh it oh no you think that all

3476.46 --> 3481.8
those events were just your dream oh yes

3480.55 --> 3484.619
[Music]

3481.8 --> 3487.1400000000003
oh how special

3484.619 --> 3490.52
where the [ __ ] is the Matrix within a

3487.14 --> 3490.52
matrix you asses

3492.94 --> 3498.3
[Music]

3495.359 --> 3502.5
I mean I literally have a script still

3498.3 --> 3505.6800000000003
on my computer a very summarized script

3502.5 --> 3509.059
of how to make a movie The Matrix within

3505.68 --> 3509.0589999999997
a matrix within a matrix

3509.22 --> 3515.64
and it's poor because I'm not much of a

3512.579 --> 3517.98
movie writer but at least it had the

3515.64 --> 3520.799
idea

3517.98 --> 3523.5
and the main idea was that Nia would

3520.799 --> 3526.44
find out that the entirety of humanity

3523.5 --> 3528.96
had been locked into this Matrix cycle

3526.44 --> 3531.48
that they can't get out because they

3528.96 --> 3535.7400000000002
keep on going in a matrix in another

3531.48 --> 3536.64
Matrix and they're all lost that was my

3535.74 --> 3539.819
plot

3536.64 --> 3542.46
for the fourth Matrix

3539.819 --> 3545.9
that they're all that they're trying to

3542.46 --> 3552.059
find out which one is the real one

3545.9 --> 3552.059
isn't that really interesting huh

3552.599 --> 3559.559
could it you could have a like a golden

3555.68 --> 3562.14
radiant pyramid a light in there

3559.559 --> 3566.099
that's dude you could have so much

3562.14 --> 3569.4
surreal and techno techno

3566.099 --> 3571.94
symbolism in there so much would have

3569.4 --> 3571.94
been possible

3582.0 --> 3587.22
the second one was correct I didn't

3584.16 --> 3590.66
think so I like the second one

3587.22 --> 3590.66
I mean I really liked it

3591.299 --> 3597.119
it's different it's not as good as a

3594.359 --> 3598.98
concept movie as the first one it was an

3597.119 --> 3600.96
expansion upon it

3598.98 --> 3603.299
it's never going to be the same as the

3600.96 --> 3604.559
first one but I did like I did like the

3603.299 --> 3607.16
follow-ups

3604.559 --> 3607.1600000000003
I did

3610.799 --> 3617.21
it's just a giant wasted opportunity

3615.059 --> 3622.219
that's all anyway

3617.21 --> 3622.219
[Music]

3626.4 --> 3633.0
I mean wouldn't it be just so cool to

3630.119 --> 3635.7000000000003
imagine like the situation

3633.0 --> 3637.98
from The Matrix two and three and I like

3635.7 --> 3640.5
the I like that war on Zion with the

3637.98 --> 3643.02
giant walker robot I loved it I thought

3640.5 --> 3645.18
it was awesome I mean I I like those

3643.02 --> 3647.94
movies I still do

3645.18 --> 3650.64
but there's issues with them but can you

3647.94 --> 3652.859
imagine like that they were would be

3650.64 --> 3656.4
like in a war

3652.859 --> 3658.619
in that war with Zion and that Neo

3656.4 --> 3660.54
comes back or something now this doesn't

3658.619 --> 3662.339
happen of course it is the plot thing

3660.54 --> 3664.799
whatever well they could have rearranged

3662.339 --> 3666.599
that Neo would not have gone to the

3664.799 --> 3670.44
machine City to die

3666.599 --> 3671.819
for this [ __ ] but instead started to

3670.44 --> 3674.94
figure out

3671.819 --> 3677.7
I feel I like I just figured out that

3674.94 --> 3680.28
this is a matrix this Zion that you've

3677.7 --> 3682.859
built all of this is also a matrix and

3680.28 --> 3685.44
that he could literally then unspot

3682.859 --> 3689.4
prove it like he would literally just

3685.44 --> 3692.579
start to fly in Zion right

3689.4 --> 3695.28
that sort of thing I mean how [ __ ]

3692.579 --> 3697.38
mind-blowing would that be

3695.28 --> 3699.5400000000004
laughs

3697.38 --> 3702.6600000000003
can you imagine

3699.54 --> 3705.7799999999997
that he would be Awakening Zion to

3702.66 --> 3709.44
figure out that this was also a matrix

3705.78 --> 3709.44
I mean whoa

3709.74 --> 3713.819
like in the middle of a battle with the

3712.319 --> 3719.7799999999997
machines

3713.819 --> 3719.7799999999997
I mean whoa what a wasted opportunity

3725.76 --> 3732.42
ah

3728.599 --> 3734.28
but yeah what it is is what we got and I

3732.42 --> 3737.88
still think it's you know it

3734.28 --> 3739.92
still like it but I cannot Overlook that

3737.88 --> 3742.2000000000003
there's just so many wasted

3739.92 --> 3744.89
opportunities that would have made it

3742.2 --> 3748.4399999999996
just beyond Epic

3744.89 --> 3750.66
[Music]

3748.44 --> 3752.819
they're Christ and they believe there is

3750.66 --> 3755.819
a redeemer yeah but what the hell does

3752.819 --> 3759.44
that have to do with the Matrix

3755.819 --> 3759.44
it's a mockery to do that

3762.72 --> 3767.299
don't you see Susanna it's a mockery

3770.22 --> 3773.4599999999996
it's a mockery of Christ that they did

3772.319 --> 3775.859
that

3773.46 --> 3778.319
you think any of these people in the

3775.859 --> 3781.02
movie or the actors or the directors

3778.319 --> 3783.599
have any level of respect for Jesus

3781.02 --> 3786.619
Christ at all

3783.599 --> 3786.619
I don't think so

3786.96 --> 3791.2200000000003
so it was just a mockery I did not like

3789.18 --> 3794.46
it I did not like that they did that

3791.22 --> 3797.819
also it was just pointless it was

3794.46 --> 3800.48
pointless for that to happen

3797.819 --> 3800.48
foreign

3814.319 --> 3817.92
yeah

3815.4 --> 3820.26
I didn't feel like that was christ-like

3817.92 --> 3822.599
at all they just they just did the

3820.26 --> 3825.599
stupid symbolism of him being in a cross

3822.599 --> 3827.76
shape and getting carried off it was it

3825.599 --> 3830.48
was blasphemy and it was completely

3827.76 --> 3830.48
pointless

3831.66 --> 3833.8999999999996
foreign

3838.76 --> 3842.78
was disappointed well yeah

3842.819 --> 3848.04
the end part

3844.92 --> 3851.28
I just did not like it at all but

3848.04 --> 3853.74
I still think overall it was pretty cool

3851.28 --> 3856.26
I really like the machine war in Zion

3853.74 --> 3858.7799999999997
and all that it was very impressive

3856.26 --> 3860.6400000000003
and it was like real the actors was

3858.78 --> 3863.6400000000003
really were really into it and all that

3860.64 --> 3866.33
so it was still a good movie

3863.64 --> 3869.54
but yeah many things wrong with it

3866.33 --> 3869.54
[Music]

3875.56 --> 3880.819
[Music]

3878.099 --> 3880.819
ah

3882.72 --> 3887.8799999999997
I mean hey if a Movie Maker can

3885.18 --> 3890.8799999999997
successfully apply some kind of

3887.88 --> 3892.92
reference to Christianity in their movie

3890.88 --> 3895.38
that is difficult

3892.92 --> 3897.599
and that deserves my respect so for

3895.38 --> 3899.76
example the movie blueberry

3897.599 --> 3902.099
does that

3899.76 --> 3905.1600000000003
they have just a very tiny little

3902.099 --> 3908.2200000000003
Christian reference almost sentimental

3905.16 --> 3911.95
but it they made it count

3908.22 --> 3911.95
[Music]

3912.079 --> 3917.7200000000003
and that that gains my respect the

3914.88 --> 3919.5
Matrix three did not do that they just

3917.72 --> 3923.819
mimicked it

3919.5 --> 3926.7
so they wanted to be Christ see that's

3923.819 --> 3928.38
what these people do

3926.7 --> 3930.299
[Music]

3928.38 --> 3932.76
this is the [ __ ]

3930.299 --> 3934.98
yeah they want to be it they want to

3932.76 --> 3937.6400000000003
just take all the virtue and just stick

3934.98 --> 3937.64
it on them

3937.799 --> 3942.54
like oh no I want to be that I want to

3940.38 --> 3945.859
be your grace

3942.54 --> 3945.859
and they don't understand

3947.339 --> 3949.819
right

3954.599 --> 3957.619
yeah anyway

3961.799 --> 3967.11
all right so we got into the Matrix

3965.4 --> 3970.449
okay

3967.11 --> 3970.449
[Music]

3980.35 --> 3989.459

he got a record number of uh visitors so

4038.78 --> 4043.1600000000003
I'm always very curious to see what

4040.88 --> 4046.2400000000002
artists are actually making

4043.16 --> 4046.24
if they're dedicated

4046.819 --> 4052.22
but at your own pace I mean you

4049.46 --> 4054.559

4083.0 --> 4086.66
ass

4084.14 --> 4089.18
to get in order I don't even want to

4086.66 --> 4093.94
know what the PS5 is like

4089.18 --> 4093.94
I just know that it's all crap

4096.44 --> 4099.58
it's all crap

4100.16 --> 4105.679
it'll just drain power

4102.699 --> 4109.639999999999
drain your focus and energy constantly

4105.679 --> 4112.42
having to fix things and [ __ ]

4109.64 --> 4112.42
errors

4112.88 --> 4116.66
no thanks

4114.679 --> 4119.54
oh oh and for all that experience you

4116.66 --> 4122.54
pay a lot of money

4119.54 --> 4125.9
to basically be preoccupied having to

4122.54 --> 4131.9
micromanage [ __ ] just to get it working

4125.9 --> 4134.12
and uh bugs lots of bugs yeah new system

oh we got the new assistant oh so you

4134.12 --> 4139.4
got the new bugs have you yeah yeah I'll

4136.52 --> 4141.5
wait like three years then before I

4139.4 --> 4145.0
would even touch a new [ __ ] console

4141.5 --> 4148.04
with all this garbage these days yeah

4145.0 --> 4151.88
garbage I mean the first thing they fix

4148.04 --> 4154.16
is the paid to play [ __ ] before they

4151.88 --> 4156.56
even fix the normal games these days

4154.16 --> 4159.0199999999995
okay I don't want to have anything to do

4156.56 --> 4161.719
with this garbage

4159.02 --> 4164.96
yeah I mean it's more like a carnival

4161.719 --> 4167.299
ride now than an entertainment console

4164.96 --> 4169.94
it's just a stupid Carnival right now

4167.299 --> 4174.0199999999995
pay as much [ __ ] money as you can

4169.94 --> 4176.299
and then have a buggy time agitated

4174.02 --> 4179.540000000001
where you can't even be happy having a

4176.299 --> 4182.359
thing yeah no thanks

4179.54 --> 4185.0
I'll stick to my PC

4182.359 --> 4188.92
with games from 10 years ago that work

4185.0 --> 4188.92
perfectly I'll do that

4189.5 --> 4195.199
hey skeptic 936 good to see you thanks

4192.38 --> 4196.09
for becoming patreon supporter

[Music]

4221.199 --> 4226.58
yep he just said dude I hate though I

4224.36 --> 4230.0599999999995
hate it it's disgusting

4226.58 --> 4232.54
that [ __ ] is disgusting

4230.06 --> 4232.54
uh

4233.84 --> 4238.6990000000005
now I want a game and I want to play the

4236.54 --> 4240.98
game and I never even want to be

4238.699 --> 4241.94
reminded that there is such a thing as

4240.98 --> 4245.78
money

4241.94 --> 4247.5199999999995
I hate pay to play I hate it I really

4245.78 --> 4249.98
really hate it

4247.52 --> 4252.8
I mean if it's a game that has pay

4249.98 --> 4254.718999999999
options where it's kind of like a little

4252.8 --> 4256.6990000000005
pointless bonus

4254.719 --> 4259.34
or whatever

4256.699 --> 4262.94
or like skins I want my special skins

4259.34 --> 4266.54
and pay for that I get it

4262.94 --> 4269.0599999999995
right but all that even

4266.54 --> 4273.5
only really works

4269.06 --> 4276.14
if the game works

4273.5 --> 4278.96
they shouldn't even have any payment

4276.14 --> 4281.2390000000005
[ __ ] little [ __ ] if the game doesn't

4278.96 --> 4284.3
work perfectly

4281.239 --> 4287.0599999999995
and this stupid habit of just bringing

4284.3 --> 4288.9800000000005
out games they're buggy as [ __ ] and then

4287.06 --> 4290.900000000001
spend like half a year trying to repair

4288.98 --> 4293.299999999999
it while people have already paid for it

4290.9 --> 4297.739
and are barely able to play it this is

4293.3 --> 4300.679
the worst habit for the industry ever

4297.739 --> 4303.98
ever I mean this is Wrecking the

4300.679 --> 4305.179
industry people hate it it that sort of

4303.98 --> 4307.159
behavior

4305.179 --> 4310.46
from Mega corporations that are into

4307.159 --> 4312.98
video games is literally causing the

4310.46 --> 4316.699
decline of Interest

4312.98 --> 4319.9
yeah people are less and less interested

4316.699 --> 4323.419999999999
in new gaming consoles and new games

4319.9 --> 4326.9
exactly because of that [ __ ]

4323.42 --> 4329.9
yeah you're literally destroying your

4326.9 --> 4332.0599999999995
own industry with that garbage don't

4329.9 --> 4334.599999999999
bring out games that don't work

4332.06 --> 4335.96

[Music]

4335.96 --> 4340.3
don't do it just do not do it

4340.64 --> 4348.26

4344.9 --> 4350.239
of not being able to fix the the most

4348.26 --> 4352.280000000001
typical box right because it's going to

4350.239 --> 4354.259999999999
be like networking over the internet and

4352.28 --> 4356.659
all that [ __ ] different computers if you

4354.26 --> 4358.52
don't have all of that [ __ ] fixed like

4356.659 --> 4360.739
within the first month

4358.52 --> 4363.26
it's a failure

4360.739 --> 4365.54
after that point the game sucks and

4363.26 --> 4366.9800000000005
everybody hates it you want to know an

4365.54 --> 4369.38
example of that

4366.98 --> 4371.599999999999
Baldur's Gate 3.

4369.38 --> 4374.2390000000005

4371.6 --> 4379.64
it's buggy as [ __ ]

4374.239 --> 4384.62
the updates are so [ __ ] slow to

4379.64 --> 4386.9800000000005
upload to low it's hours and hours it's

4384.62 --> 4390.8

4395.659 --> 4400.179
on that thing it's embarrassment to me

4400.5 --> 4403.68
[Music]

4404.179 --> 4408.58
and that's a PC game yeah

4409.28 --> 4413.86
I don't even want to touch the consoles

4411.56 --> 4413.860000000001
anymore

4426.02 --> 4429.9800000000005
you're already going to buy it why don't

4428.06 --> 4431.900000000001
you say Supreme knowing why don't you

4429.98 --> 4434.419999999999
just not do it

4431.9 --> 4435.92
how about that how about you just don't

4434.42 --> 4440.9800000000005
do it

4435.92 --> 4440.9800000000005
just not buy it how about that

4442.82 --> 4448.04
yeah that way you don't have to regret

4445.46 --> 4452.36
it how about that if you already know

4448.04 --> 4455.06
that then how about just not buying it

4452.36 --> 4458.36
how about you saying hey how about you

4455.06 --> 4460.76
game companies go [ __ ] yourself

4458.36 --> 4462.739
I'll I'll get it when nobody's

4460.76 --> 4464.900000000001
interested anymore when you finally

4462.739 --> 4467.919999999999
fixed it

4464.9 --> 4467.92
how about that

4470.9 --> 4476.259999999999
I mean seriously why the hell would you

4473.06 --> 4481.0
do that to yourself just wait a year

4476.26 --> 4481.0
just wait a year

4484.04 --> 4486.82
I mean it

4489.38 --> 4492.7390000000005
I mean as soon as they bring out the

4491.179 --> 4495.679
game they're still gonna have to fix

4492.739 --> 4498.919999999999
everything anyway so even if literally

4495.679 --> 4501.02
nobody bought it or almost nobody

4498.92 --> 4503.0
they're still gonna spend like a year

4501.02 --> 4505.9400000000005
trying to fix it anyway

4503.0 --> 4508.4
because they got this stupid habit of

4505.94 --> 4511.099999999999
selling games putting it out for the

4508.4 --> 4514.58
public when it's not fixed

4511.1 --> 4516.8
yet so let them just do it it's like oh

4514.58 --> 4520.78
yeah yeah how about you just fix it

4516.8 --> 4520.78
we'll just buy it when it's fixed

4564.08 --> 4570.199
money wasting platforms

free are so boring

4575.26 --> 4581.4800000000005
so boring and the misadvertisement is

4578.9 --> 4584.0
getting downright Criminal

4581.48 --> 4588.799999999999
do you know what I mean I mean seriously

4584.0 --> 4592.34
this game online at ads are just

4588.8 --> 4593.900000000001
criminally deceptive

4592.34 --> 4595.64
there's this certain type of game that

4593.9 --> 4597.379999999999
I'm not even gonna mention the word

4595.64 --> 4599.360000000001
anymore and I don't want anybody to ever

4597.38 --> 4602.78
mention that because I want them to die

4599.36 --> 4605.599999999999
to extinguish themselves because they're

4602.78 --> 4607.88
such rip-offs

4605.6 --> 4609.14
like they show all these things that you

4607.88 --> 4612.4400000000005
could supposedly could do with this game

4609.14 --> 4614.3
and the game never does any of it like a

4612.44 --> 4616.58
thousand options so oh look you can do

4614.3 --> 4619.1
this you could do yeah nothing about

4616.58 --> 4621.199
that is in the game ever you tell

4619.1 --> 4626.679
flaunted in your face day in after day

4621.199 --> 4626.678999999999
they will do it and it's always a lie

4631.159 --> 4636.739
because those games suck they're lame

4634.179 --> 4641.26
they're boring

4636.739 --> 4641.259999999999
they're barely even visually interesting

4641.96 --> 4646.1
it's a complete waste of time and a

4644.36 --> 4648.199
rip-off for people

4646.1 --> 4650.360000000001
that are just bored and easily

4648.199 --> 4654.5199999999995
distracted and they're stupid enough to

4650.36 --> 4654.5199999999995
waste money on complete garbage

4657.8 --> 4661.58
yeah there's a few games out there that

4659.84 --> 4664.34
are still kind of cool

4661.58 --> 4666.0199999999995
but they're very rare

4664.34 --> 4668.92
very rare

4666.02 --> 4671.780000000001
very rare to even

4668.92 --> 4673.58
be different from all the other standard

4671.78 --> 4676.28
[ __ ] games

4673.58 --> 4679.04
because they're all the same all of them

4676.28 --> 4681.98
are the same I've played like six

4679.04 --> 4685.159
different games online stupid games over

4681.98 --> 4688.48
the last six years and guess what

4685.159 --> 4690.879999999999
you can barely even even visually

4688.48 --> 4694.0
distinguish them from one another

4690.88 --> 4697.82
they're exactly the same

4694.0 --> 4700.239
exactly the same same map setup same

4697.82 --> 4702.92
mechanism same freaking

4700.239 --> 4705.0199999999995
programming that directs the things

4702.92 --> 4707.78
happening I can literally see that just

4705.02 --> 4710.320000000001
the stupid [ __ ] is literally the same

4707.78 --> 4714.5
thing there's just a cookie cutter

4710.32 --> 4717.259999999999
[ __ ] format system for online shitty

4714.5 --> 4720.5
games and they're all the same they all

4717.26 --> 4724.6990000000005
look exactly the same do the same are

4720.5 --> 4726.94
the same level of boring and pointless

4724.699 --> 4726.94
foreign

4730.19 --> 4736.7699999999995
[Music]

4739.78 --> 4744.86
yeah sure

4742.159 --> 4748.719
be just seen it I mean look

4744.86 --> 4751.5199999999995
there's a massive online thingy

4748.719 --> 4753.44
then yeah I mean if it's a good game

4751.52 --> 4755.719
then yeah I guess you could pay for that

4753.44 --> 4759.62
and if that's worth it to you why not I

4755.719 --> 4761.9800000000005
mean there's people that pay to watch a

4759.62 --> 4761.98
channel

4763.1 --> 4768.02
like they pay monthly to just watch

4766.34 --> 4769.9400000000005
their channel so why would you not do

4768.02 --> 4771.9800000000005
the same to be able to play a video game

4769.94 --> 4774.139999999999
I mean

4771.98 --> 4777.639999999999
I have no objections to that I have

4774.14 --> 4781.52
objections to heavily advertised

4777.64 --> 4784.34
misadvertised shitty online games that

4781.52 --> 4786.02
are so boring they like almost force it

4784.34 --> 4788.78
to just start throwing money at it

4786.02 --> 4793.900000000001
because it's so [ __ ] boring

4788.78 --> 4793.9
those games those games can [ __ ] die

4795.86 --> 4803.3189999999995
thank you anyway

4797.66 --> 4803.3189999999995
[Music]

4808.28 --> 4812.48
I mean if a game was just really

4810.5 --> 4815.54
interesting and people would waste their

4812.48 --> 4817.94
money on it I'd be like yeah that's a

4815.54 --> 4820.219
bit tricky you know but at least it

4817.94 --> 4823.04
would be an interesting game

4820.219 --> 4826.58
but people throwing money at games that

4823.04 --> 4830.679
are super boring that's just an atrocity

4826.58 --> 4830.679
it is just an atrocity

4834.26 --> 4837.02
yeah

4835.34 --> 4839.6
anyway

4837.02 --> 4843.320000000001
I tend not to play games so I can't add

4839.6 --> 4846.679
much to it oh I don't play it either

4843.32 --> 4848.84
anymore I have a couple

4846.679 --> 4850.82
and I literally just once I figure out

4848.84 --> 4852.860000000001
okay this is just never gonna change

4850.82 --> 4855.199
it's gonna be the same boring dumbass

4852.86 --> 4857.12
[ __ ] every time it's all busying therapy

4855.199 --> 4859.94
it's just taking time out of my day then

4857.12 --> 4862.4
I say okay go [ __ ] yourself then and

4859.94 --> 4864.32
then delete it I literally delete the

4862.4 --> 4866.48
page I just shove it in a corner

4864.32 --> 4868.82
somewhere and I never look at it again

4866.48 --> 4873.08
and there's there's like

4868.82 --> 4878.0199999999995
four or five of those types of games

4873.08 --> 4878.0199999999995
in the last eight years or more

4880.88 --> 4887.0
four not five and every time I just

4884.239 --> 4888.919999999999
figure out like oh God it's it's exactly

4887.0 --> 4891.62
the same [ __ ] game isn't it it's

4888.92 --> 4893.36
exactly the same [ __ ] thing

4891.62 --> 4894.739
and then I was like yeah okay I'm done

4893.36 --> 4897.92
with this [ __ ]

4894.739 --> 4899.12
bye yeah I'm not gonna waste any money

4897.92 --> 4901.04
on you

4899.12 --> 4903.44
for the record

4901.04 --> 4905.54
yeah I mean if it's an interesting game

4903.44 --> 4907.5199999999995
yeah I'll waste money on it

4905.54 --> 4910.28
a little

4907.52 --> 4913.6990000000005
right just to be like okay well it is

4910.28 --> 4915.679
technically free so I am just gonna

4913.699 --> 4918.5599999999995
give a little bit of a paycheck

4915.679 --> 4920.84
recognition because I like the game if

4918.56 --> 4922.820000000001
you just figure out oh but it's exactly

4920.84 --> 4924.9800000000005
the same dumbass game as all these

4922.82 --> 4928.219
others then why the hell would you give

4924.98 --> 4931.54
them their your money don't do it

4928.219 --> 4931.54
let them die

4932.0 --> 4937.04
anyways how the hell did I end up

4934.94 --> 4939.82
talking about games

4937.04 --> 4939.82
uh

4941.84 --> 4948.1990000000005
I always end up just with subjects that

4944.36 --> 4950.9
I can't remember how I even got to that

4948.199 --> 4953.5
anyway it doesn't matter it's still good

4950.9 --> 4953.5
to discuss

4955.3 --> 4961.360000000001
no turret no more freaking crickets

4974.679 --> 4979.79
wait what

4976.44 --> 4979.79
[Music]

4982.64 --> 4988.0
computer games are now on sports

4984.739 --> 4988.0

5010.54 --> 5016.42

5013.719 --> 5018.58
uh sorry you didn't actually in this

5016.42 --> 5020.4400000000005
case but you mentioned sports channels

5018.58 --> 5023.38
and I was immediately assuming you were

5020.44 --> 5024.94
gonna start talking about Cricket again

5023.38 --> 5027.159000000001
sorry

5024.94 --> 5029.94
it's just that you kind of have been in

5027.159 --> 5029.94
the last week

5047.699 --> 5054.46
Esports have been what

5051.34 --> 5057.42
it isn't a sport

5054.46 --> 5057.42
what the [ __ ]

5058.96 --> 5063.52
I can't believe they actually go going

5061.54 --> 5066.46
there

5063.52 --> 5068.860000000001
I mean yeah video game tournaments is

5066.46 --> 5071.02
it's cool in that

5068.86 --> 5074.46
and all that

5071.02 --> 5074.46
but it's not a sport

5074.679 --> 5079.9
actually requires you to be do something

5077.8 --> 5083.25
physical in the real world

5079.9 --> 5083.25
[Music]

5086.199 --> 5092.339999999999

5104.35 --> 5113.119000000001
[Music]

5113.98 --> 5121.32
all right so it just sounds like

5116.98 --> 5121.32
this watch channels are apparently

5125.38 --> 5130.12
making way for

5127.719 --> 5132.1
watching video games

5130.12 --> 5134.5599999999995
so I guess they just want to shove

5132.1 --> 5137.76
everybody behind

5134.56 --> 5141.84
their computer instead of going out and

5137.76 --> 5141.84

and although they're banning all these

5722.8 --> 5727.4800000000005
people oh really

5724.84 --> 5730.06
are they I'm not noticing anything about

5727.48 --> 5733.0
it like anything and it's not like I'm

5730.06 --> 5735.280000000001
I'm holding back when it comes to my own

5733.0 --> 5737.38
expression or anything I'll just say

5735.28 --> 5740.98
whatever the [ __ ] I want

5737.38 --> 5744.58
including mentioning Jews

5740.98 --> 5745.9
or any of that other [ __ ] I'll just do

5744.58 --> 5749.4
it

5745.9 --> 5749.4
it doesn't really seem to matter

5751.6 --> 5755.679
right because I'm not having like a

5753.82 --> 5757.239
political war

5755.679 --> 5759.34
like that

5757.239 --> 5761.919999999999
I think it's it's really mostly just

5759.34 --> 5765.76
political [ __ ] that they go after

5761.92 --> 5768.04
anything related to to political

5765.76 --> 5771.4800000000005
opposition to globalism they typically

5768.04 --> 5775.78
do that well I am not a politician

5771.48 --> 5778.0599999999995
so they seem to leave me alone

5775.78 --> 5780.159
and I'm very happy about that I'd like

5778.06 --> 5782.159000000001
to keep it that way because yeah at this

5780.159 --> 5785.92
current moment

5782.159 --> 5788.739
if I did not have PayPal to basically

5785.92 --> 5791.88
take donations then I literally wouldn't

5788.739 --> 5791.879999999999
be able to do this show

5791.92 --> 5794.92
but

5795.219 --> 5800.679
still want to keep an eye out for a

5797.8 --> 5802.719
potential other Payment Systems if you

5800.679 --> 5805.2390000000005
know any the problem though is that most

5802.719 --> 5806.5
of the alternative payment systems are

5805.239 --> 5809.0199999999995
usually

5806.5 --> 5810.94
like America only

5809.02 --> 5812.7390000000005
and yeah I live in the Netherlands so

5810.94 --> 5815.86
that's completely useless to me I mean

5812.739 --> 5818.44
PayPal thus far has been the only

5815.86 --> 5820.599999999999
International online banking system that

5818.44 --> 5823.599999999999
I've been able to use for this

5820.6 --> 5825.88
besides patreon and GoFundMe they're not

5823.6 --> 5828.58
great so

5825.88 --> 5832.719
if there's any other system popping up

5828.58 --> 5835.739
that's not just another money trap

5832.719 --> 5840.12
or metadata leeching system or whatever

5835.739 --> 5840.12
then please inform me about it

5848.56 --> 5852.820000000001
okay don't like talking anybody talking

5851.08 --> 5857.58
about their current scams well good

5852.82 --> 5857.58
because I'm completely not interested

5857.62 --> 5861.659
I don't give a [ __ ] what they do

5863.08 --> 5869.5
I mean I can imagine they're promoting

5865.9 --> 5872.739
the worst of the worst imaginable don't

5869.5 --> 5873.13
care I don't give a [ __ ] it's their

5872.739 --> 5874.54
problem

5873.13 --> 5877.179
[Music]

5874.54 --> 5879.28
not mine it's only gonna be my problem

5877.179 --> 5882.9
they're gonna make it my problem and it

5879.28 --> 5882.9
isn't and I like to keep it that way

5883.659 --> 5887.379999999999
because I need a payment system that can

5886.36 --> 5890.32
work

5887.38 --> 5893.62
I don't give a [ __ ] if Satan himself

5890.32 --> 5896.92
owns it I don't give a [ __ ] because it's

5893.62 --> 5899.38
the only option I have yeah so until I

5896.92 --> 5901.42
get a viable alternative that is

5899.38 --> 5903.58
actually viable and durable it's not

5901.42 --> 5905.38
gonna like shut down all of a sudden in

5903.58 --> 5908.5599999999995
half a year

5905.38 --> 5910.12
then I really want to know about it

5908.56 --> 5913.179
because I don't like it when there's

5910.12 --> 5915.46
only one option because typically that

5913.179 --> 5917.56
is where the devil starts seating and I

5915.46 --> 5920.86
don't like that but on the other hand I

5917.56 --> 5922.580000000001
don't like zero options either

5920.86 --> 5928.5289999999995
so

5922.58 --> 5928.5289999999995
[Music]

5928.659 --> 5933.4
all right anyway take a two minute break

5931.0 --> 5937.08

6000.659 --> 6002.78
thank you

6022.639 --> 6027.54
oh yeah and I guess I'm not gonna have

6025.44 --> 6030.178999999999
this Gusto energy drink

6027.54 --> 6031.56
so I'm just gonna probably keep it in my

6030.179 --> 6034.139
cooler

6031.56 --> 6036.96
until Springtime and then see how long

6034.139 --> 6042.26
those bottles actually last

6036.96 --> 6052.6
they don't get gross or anything no idea

want me to discuss or address or

6098.4 --> 6100.699
anything

6118.44 --> 6125.5199999999995
or any well feedback on my title on the

record long again

6128.88 --> 6133.9800000000005
the situation anything guys girls

6135.78 --> 6140.34
or maybe you had like a niche technical

6138.119 --> 6143.82
question about something Flat Earth

6140.34 --> 6145.78
model related or something just just say

6143.82 --> 6153.969
something

6145.78 --> 6153.969
[Music]

6159.92 --> 6163.229
[Music]

6163.32 --> 6166.219
foreign

6177.32 --> 6182.46
lands what do you think about it

6180.3 --> 6183.99
well I think that they don't really know

6182.46 --> 6187.08
what the layout is

6183.99 --> 6187.08
[Music]

6193.739 --> 6199.619
I think there is more land

6196.98 --> 6202.619
a lot more land actually I think that

6199.619 --> 6204.839999999999
this realm segment that we are familiar

6202.619 --> 6207.92
with is actually

6204.84 --> 6207.92
quite small

6208.98 --> 6214.199
compared to what else is out there

6212.34 --> 6216.96
I think that the total amount of

6214.199 --> 6221.638999999999
available land within the containment

6216.96 --> 6223.92
that we are in is probably at least

6221.639 --> 6226.8
three times

6223.92 --> 6229.34
the total available land and ocean that

6226.8 --> 6229.34
we know about

6232.38 --> 6239.82
and it might be 30 times more

6235.92 --> 6245.04
I don't know like how can you tell until

6239.82 --> 6247.5
you literally bump into a barrier or you

6245.04 --> 6249.9
go in a straight line and you literally

6247.5 --> 6251.76
end up on exactly the same Landmark

6249.9 --> 6254.94
where you started

6251.76 --> 6257.400000000001
it's pointless it like it could be more

6254.94 --> 6259.86
it could always be more than

6257.4 --> 6261.799999999999
right until you bump into a barrier or

6259.86 --> 6264.78
you literally move it

6261.8 --> 6268.7390000000005
exactly back where you started

6264.78 --> 6271.5
you don't know how much that can be

6268.739 --> 6274.259999999999
right who knows man maybe it's like a

6271.5 --> 6277.739
weird looping system and there's like

6274.26 --> 6281.58
this one little Passage through that'll

6277.739 --> 6284.339999999999
lead to like 300 more

6281.58 --> 6286.739
realm consonants

6284.34 --> 6288.3
and you only can go through there in a

6286.739 --> 6290.94
very specific time of year or something

6288.3 --> 6292.619000000001
and even even to get through that Loop

6290.94 --> 6297.5599999999995
because otherwise it will be close like

6292.619 --> 6297.5599999999995
who the hell even knows these things

6298.56 --> 6304.7390000000005
we don't know we don't even know the

6301.32 --> 6308.58
lands that are just directly readily

6304.739 --> 6312.419999999999
there without any Loop

6308.58 --> 6314.1
or whatever closing it off from us like

6312.42 --> 6317.119
there's already land pretty much

6314.1 --> 6317.119000000001
surrounding us

6318.179 --> 6321.08
it's already there

6322.8 --> 6328.860000000001
but there might even be more land that's

6325.44 --> 6331.138999999999
like a little less easy to access and

6328.86 --> 6335.48
this yeah these Lands Beyond Antarctica

6331.139 --> 6335.4800000000005
aren't exactly easy to access so

my God that is so classic fiber oats

6357.719 --> 6361.26
God

6358.82 --> 6364.04
Coriolis effect the water spinning in

6361.26 --> 6364.04
the toilet it's

6364.139 --> 6369.179
it's so bizarre that that's

6367.139 --> 6371.28
that that's still going around did you

6369.179 --> 6375.06
know that even if you like look up

6371.28 --> 6377.58
Coriolis effect on on Wiki it's not in

6375.06 --> 6380.9400000000005
there like it's been officially

6377.58 --> 6383.46
denounced Like official by the priests

6380.94 --> 6386.4
themselves like yeah that's a stupid

6383.46 --> 6389.28
story that doesn't actually work

6386.4 --> 6391.199
Sometimes some [ __ ] still will act

6389.28 --> 6393.179
like it does work and then start

6391.199 --> 6395.159
reaffirming that nonsense story again

6393.179 --> 6397.86
but officially it's kind of been

6395.159 --> 6401.42
disclaimed that it even is a thing

6397.86 --> 6401.42
it's so ridiculous

6401.52 --> 6405.719
in Pacific Ocean more land yeah there's

6403.619 --> 6408.0
a good chance to that turret I mean the

6405.719 --> 6412.699
Pacific Ocean is likely to be a lot

6408.0 --> 6412.699
larger than the maps make it out to be

6413.82 --> 6419.28
so there's a chance that there's just

6416.58 --> 6421.26
entire islands that have that we've

6419.28 --> 6425.0599999999995
never heard of before

6532.199 --> 6537.04
stupid water spin

[Music]

6549.78 --> 6551.96
thank you

6555.8 --> 6559.76
the page is changed

6566.42 --> 6573.42
there's now a separate coriolis Force

6569.82 --> 6575.82
which is a contradiction in terms

6573.42 --> 6579.36
because Coriolis effect is an apparent

6575.82 --> 6582.42
so it can't have a force so coriolis

6579.36 --> 6586.94
force is not a force

6582.42 --> 6586.9400000000005
which makes it kind of oxymoronic

6590.04 --> 6596.28
right in that page there's still this

6593.159 --> 6598.0199999999995
the nonsense story about how koreole is

6596.28 --> 6600.48
because of Earth

6598.02 --> 6603.719
spin is supposedly creating Cyclones

6600.48 --> 6607.638999999999
which is like one of the most [ __ ]

6603.719 --> 6613.02
conceptions I've ever heard

6607.639 --> 6615.4800000000005
like an assault on your intelligence

6613.02 --> 6618.38
does not like it's literally an assault

6615.48 --> 6618.379999999999
on your intelligence

6622.619 --> 6626.88
going to call it yeah but it isn't

6625.26 --> 6628.9800000000005
because you know the thing about

6626.88 --> 6630.659000000001
fictitious

6628.98 --> 6635.638999999999
you know what that's based on the word

6630.659 --> 6639.0
fiction what does fiction mean not real

6635.639 --> 6641.28
not actual yeah yeah so it's not a force

6639.0 --> 6644.9
it isn't

6641.28 --> 6644.9
it it's an apparent deviation

6645.179 --> 6650.159

6648.06 --> 6651.81
probably an anti-flat earth and I'm
