right so

88.72 --> 93.84
today the weather is well not

92.0 --> 95.439
super sunny as it was yesterday but

93.84 --> 98.96000000000001
still little

95.439 --> 100.32
but i guess it's very similar to

98.96 --> 103.67999999999999
yesterday except

100.32 --> 105.03999999999999
a little bit more moist and all right

103.68 --> 107.84
now there's clouds

105.04 --> 107.84
from the sun

110.96 --> 115.83999999999999
there's no wind

118.159 --> 129.84
all right

130.75 --> 134.039
[Music]

135.36 --> 143.76000000000002
all right so

139.12 --> 147.12
i got green tea with me today

143.76 --> 147.76
and i see em first in chat and here we

147.12 --> 151.68
go again

147.76 --> 156.48
yeah good to see you saturday the 23rd

151.68 --> 158.8
of january 2021

156.48 --> 158.79999999999998
ah

160.959 --> 169.04
had a late night last night just

165.599 --> 169.04
just was kept up late

169.84 --> 173.76
also yeah i've been playing some polish

171.92 --> 177.92
gate 3

173.76 --> 181.35999999999999
now since the first run i tried that out

177.92 --> 185.76
i had graphics issues constantly and

181.36 --> 189.84
on top of that like the game is not so

185.76 --> 193.12
easy straightforward compared to like

189.84 --> 196.239
older bonus gate games

193.12 --> 197.20000000000002
so yeah and it's it's a bit more of a

196.239 --> 199.12
challenge but i

197.2 --> 200.95899999999997
basically at some point thought like uh

199.12 --> 204.13
screw this

200.959 --> 205.44
i'm gonna have to find a way to somehow

204.13 --> 207.76
[Music]

205.44 --> 209.28
yeah get beyond level one as it were

207.76 --> 211.44
because

209.28 --> 212.879
where i went with the characters yeah

211.44 --> 214.319
this might be a little bit boring to

212.879 --> 217.35999999999999
some

214.319 --> 219.76
it's just everything was too difficult

217.36 --> 221.36
right but i managed to like crawl my way

219.76 --> 224.39999999999998
back to the beginning

221.36 --> 226.31900000000002
and just yeah

224.4 --> 228.159
it was more doable that way it has been

226.319 --> 230.07999999999998
kind of fun

228.159 --> 232.72
especially with like lowering the

230.08 --> 234.959
graphics setting yeah it's less

232.72 --> 236.239
less beautiful but at least everything

234.959 --> 239.04
is fluid

236.239 --> 240.959
and cut scenes don't take like two

239.04 --> 244.4
minutes

240.959 --> 248.56
for like a two second clip

244.4 --> 248.56
and yeah it's been halfway amusing

249.04 --> 252.239
and getting used to the new mechanics

251.2 --> 254.79899999999998
how that works

252.239 --> 256.0
in this system just apparently based on

254.799 --> 260.0
dnd

256.0 --> 260.0
five or six i don't know

261.359 --> 265.44
with some interesting functions in there

265.84 --> 274.63899999999995
ah hey hello cameron gilmore

269.6 --> 278.639
reggie benneke good to see you

274.639 --> 283.84000000000003
alright so

278.639 --> 283.84000000000003
what's going down

288.0 --> 297.84
hey steamy traveler good to see you

298.08 --> 301.68
let's see didn't take any notes probably

300.56 --> 304.35
not

301.68 --> 306.32
right nope i thought so

304.35 --> 311.84000000000003
[Music]

306.32 --> 311.84
any notes i don't know why

320.24 --> 324.24
well i remember uh yeah flat earth

323.12 --> 326.88
debates was

324.24 --> 326.88
pretty awesome

327.52 --> 330.79999999999995
so yeah playing a baller it's something

329.6 --> 333.28000000000003
that i do

330.8 --> 335.52000000000004
in recent times i'm playing the ballers

333.28 --> 335.52
game

335.919 --> 339.919
and i do yeah it is kind of amusing to

338.56 --> 342.0
do that

339.919 --> 344.0
and it like confuses the hell out of

342.0 --> 346.72
nathan sometimes and in a way that is

344.0 --> 346.72
kind of funny

348.4 --> 352.0
i try not to push him too far with it

351.36 --> 356.0
but i

352.0 --> 359.68
yeah i played the ballers game

356.0 --> 361.199
using their own confusion and basically

359.68 --> 364.319
assimilating that

361.199 --> 367.12
and then just trying to defend

364.319 --> 370.08000000000004
the globe from that perspective and i'm

367.12 --> 372.56
getting pretty good at it

370.08 --> 374.88
you were on form i win thanks here we go

372.56 --> 374.88
again

375.759 --> 380.24
i have plenty of experience in the past

378.08 --> 382.31899999999996
i would like way in the past when there

380.24 --> 385.36
was no flat earth debate so when

382.319 --> 387.03900000000004
some subject concerning it was discussed

385.36 --> 390.40000000000003
i would pretty much do the same thing

387.039 --> 392.639
except believing it

390.4 --> 395.84
that's the difference i would actually

392.639 --> 395.84000000000003
believe it

396.0 --> 400.4
and uh yeah looking back at it that made

398.639 --> 402.58
me look pretty stupid but i thought i

400.4 --> 405.039
was really smart

402.58 --> 408.8
[Music]

405.039 --> 410.34
back then but it's not if you actually

408.8 --> 412.639
believe that then you're just

410.34 --> 416.23999999999995
[Music]

412.639 --> 417.919
being extremely liberal with knowledge

416.24 --> 419.84000000000003
as it were

417.919 --> 422.08
and yeah that doesn't lead anywhere just

419.84 --> 424.88
leads to the reinforcement of the

422.08 --> 424.88
reification

429.84 --> 434.31899999999996
has nathan ever gone off on me like with

432.639 --> 437.36
nathan thompson

434.319 --> 439.44
in the past yeah yeah sure

437.36 --> 441.039
like when i was still trying to defend

439.44 --> 444.319
gravity i

441.039 --> 446.88
i i got

444.319 --> 448.08000000000004
yeah i got treated pretty roughly at a

446.88 --> 449.919
certain point

448.08 --> 451.199
but i was still in the learning process

449.919 --> 455.039
so

451.199 --> 458.8
i've never really doubled down

455.039 --> 462.4
for no reason on stupidity

458.8 --> 465.44
so i don't think i've ever had a

462.4 --> 467.919
treatment like nathan thompson did

465.44 --> 469.199
because that guy is sometimes a little

467.919 --> 472.4
bit

469.199 --> 476.08000000000004
headstrong yeah

472.4 --> 480.479
for not very effective reasons

476.08 --> 485.84
it's just being headstrong and stubborn

480.479 --> 488.87899999999996
and i've always been stubborn

485.84 --> 490.479
but never always for a productive reason

488.879 --> 492.56
always because i think like there is

490.479 --> 495.28
more to be figured out

492.56 --> 498.8
and then if it eventually figure out

495.28 --> 498.79999999999995
that there isn't then i drop it

498.879 --> 504.84000000000003
because i i am not in the habit of

501.199 --> 507.84000000000003
reifying things that are that i can't

504.84 --> 507.84
prove

508.16 --> 510.47900000000004
what

511.28 --> 516.7189999999999
these guys printed out a big photo of

514.8 --> 517.68
you this week what were you talking

516.719 --> 521.839
about

517.68 --> 521.8389999999999
dmk 2020

524.159 --> 535.8389999999999
why hello matthew eastman

549.6 --> 556.5600000000001
so can you be more specific dmk 2020

553.6 --> 556.5600000000001
these guys

557.519 --> 564.16
these guys okay these guys printed out a

560.72 --> 564.1600000000001
photo am i that popular

565.36 --> 569.279
or did they need a new photograph for

567.44 --> 577.839
their dart board or something

569.279 --> 577.8389999999999
like what are you talking about

594.72 --> 602.24
or just leave it there and don't

599.12 --> 603.92
don't respond to it that's all fine it

602.24 --> 605.6
probably is complete [Â __Â ] who's

603.92 --> 608.4799999999999
gonna print out a photograph of me

605.6 --> 610.0790000000001
that's ridiculous

608.48 --> 612.9590000000001
i think the last person that has done

610.079 --> 619.8389999999999
that is my freaking mother

612.959 --> 619.8389999999999
so that's like 20 years ago

623.2 --> 628.1600000000001
ah for their dartboard okay that makes

630.839 --> 633.839
sense

633.92 --> 647.8389999999999
so which guys exactly were that

637.44 --> 647.839
where did you hear that

652.959 --> 656.64
yeah steamy traveler it's called being a

655.04 --> 658.64
terrible speller and

656.64 --> 660.56
hitting enter before reading what you

658.64 --> 675.8389999999999
actually put down in the text

660.56 --> 675.8389999999999
yeah that's what that is so

677.519 --> 681.2
i get to feeling this guy's typing on

679.44 --> 682.24
his phone that would typically result in

681.2 --> 684.399
that sort of

682.24 --> 686.0
error and yeah if you make an error

684.399 --> 688.16
while typing on your phone

686.0 --> 689.68
it's going to be pretty difficult to

688.16 --> 692.16
correct it it's not as quick as when

689.68 --> 703.8389999999999
you're using an actual keyboard with a

692.16 --> 703.8389999999999
computer so

713.36 --> 719.6
anyway yeah uh

716.399 --> 721.279
it doesn't really matter anyway like

719.6 --> 723.279
people want to make print out a

721.279 --> 724.8
photograph and put me in some kind of a

723.279 --> 730.24
pit

724.8 --> 734.0
that's fine i'm fine

730.24 --> 734.0
it's not gonna have an influence

734.399 --> 739.839
right let's just say that they did that

738.32 --> 741.44
first thing that's gonna happen is

739.839 --> 743.519
somebody's going to

741.44 --> 744.5600000000001
an outsider is going to see it and then

743.519 --> 748.16
be like

744.56 --> 750.399
oh who's that guy why have do you have a

748.16 --> 752.88
photo of him printed out

750.399 --> 753.839
and using it as a dart board that's like

752.88 --> 756.88
wow

753.839 --> 759.0400000000001
you must really dislike him so yeah that

756.88 --> 761.279
way

759.04 --> 764.079
even if they do that it's only going to

761.279 --> 767.36
serve as advertisement

764.079 --> 767.68
it's like if they really care about me

767.36 --> 769.76
they

767.68 --> 772.3199999999999
are going to by doing these things

769.76 --> 776.0
advertise for me one way or another

772.32 --> 778.24
doesn't really matter if they hate me

776.0 --> 779.36
they're going to put me in a pit on

778.24 --> 781.36
display

779.36 --> 782.8000000000001
somehow they're just going to advertise

781.36 --> 784.8000000000001
for me they're just going to show like

782.8 --> 787.8389999999999
this person

784.8 --> 787.8389999999999
scott my mind

788.0 --> 794.88
enough to yeah print out a photograph

791.36 --> 794.88
and then use it as a dartboard

798.839 --> 804.639
right

801.6 --> 807.6
out of the liberty

804.639 --> 809.6
as i was walking what are you talking

807.6 --> 812.32
about

809.6 --> 815.6800000000001
coming out of the liberty like is

812.32 --> 818.0790000000001
english your first language

815.68 --> 819.519
for [Â __Â ] sake dude i appreciate

818.079 --> 823.8389999999999
getting a form but it's

819.519 --> 829.839
getting a bit of a bit of a hassle

823.839 --> 829.839
to try and interpret what you're saying

833.1 --> 836.289
[Music]

838.079 --> 843.8389999999999
you can't stand nathan oakley's voice

841.199 --> 843.8389999999999
ah

847.12 --> 851.76
really so because you don't like the

851.04 --> 857.8389999999999
voice you'd

851.76 --> 857.8389999999999
you'd have a dart board of him

860.399 --> 871.839
what about his arguments

880.72 --> 885.279
must be quite a annoying though like if

883.44 --> 887.12
you don't appreciate his voice

885.279 --> 889.68
then yeah that's going to be annoying

887.12 --> 893.36
because he is really out there

889.68 --> 897.04
and having a lot of influence

893.36 --> 897.04
and there's going to be a lot of people

897.519 --> 901.76
using pieces of his voice as well so

902.399 --> 908.48
he's vile he would have a great show

905.68 --> 913.8389999999999
his is crap repetition no i disagree

908.48 --> 913.839
with that

920.88 --> 926.48
oh yeah nathan can be a little vile here

923.92 --> 929.519
and there but he only really

926.48 --> 930.639
utilizes that at the moment where

929.519 --> 932.9590000000001
ballers just

930.639 --> 934.639
get really stupid and doubling down in

932.959 --> 938.0
rumpusy and all that

934.639 --> 940.399
you know so it's i don't know like i can

938.0 --> 943.6
get pretty filed too

940.399 --> 943.6
if i allow it

944.079 --> 951.12
i just don't really allow it like i

947.36 --> 953.04
i've chosen other types of strategy

951.12 --> 956.399
to be a little bit more forthcoming but

953.04 --> 960.399
i'm yeah i'm not

956.399 --> 964.16
handing them any wins or anything

960.399 --> 968.72
you know i don't even have to defend

964.16 --> 973.4399999999999
any of my ideas in order to just

968.72 --> 973.44
yeah win no matter what

975.36 --> 979.519
because i know how they work how they

977.519 --> 983.279
think

979.519 --> 985.36
how they argue what the cruxes are where

983.279 --> 988.0
the pitfalls are in their model i know

985.36 --> 990.9590000000001
it better than most ballers

988.0 --> 991.759
i don't really need to get hard on them

990.959 --> 995.5999999999999
because they

991.759 --> 997.6
are being headstrong religious zealots

995.6 --> 1000.32
that is already pretty evident but yeah

997.6 --> 1004.24
nathan does go hard at it because

1000.32 --> 1005.759
well because he likes to it annoys him

1004.24 --> 1008.0790000000001
and i think because there's a lot of

1005.759 --> 1008.8000000000001
people that are just very frustrated

1008.079 --> 1012.2399999999999
with

1008.8 --> 1015.279
this kind of religious zealous behavior

1012.24 --> 1018.24
and they and they themselves want to go

1015.279 --> 1020.399
at it hard it's just too much of a

1018.24 --> 1021.12
hassle and nathan's very proficient at

1020.399 --> 1023.6
it

1021.12 --> 1025.679
so that's why there's kind of like this

1023.6 --> 1026.24
unspoken market for it and i think

1025.679 --> 1029.3600000000001
that's

1026.24 --> 1032.16
part of his popularity actually

1029.36 --> 1033.1989999999998
is going hard at it and maybe a little

1032.16 --> 1037.039
vile

1033.199 --> 1040.4
but sometimes i think that he does

1037.039 --> 1042.799
overstep unnecessary boundaries but he's

1040.4 --> 1046.0790000000002
almost doing it just

1042.799 --> 1048.24
out of yeah not our stubbornness it's

1046.079 --> 1048.24
just

1048.559 --> 1056.6399999999999
out of principle he doesn't really

1052.64 --> 1059.3600000000001
want to be holding back

1056.64 --> 1061.6000000000001
i think i i don't know he's in chat by

1059.36 --> 1061.6
the way

1062.64 --> 1069.3600000000001
so nathan i take it you don't hold back

1066.24 --> 1069.36
uh and you just

1071.919 --> 1076.3200000000002
you do it probably because the ballers

1074.4 --> 1078.3200000000002
don't really hold back and they get as

1076.32 --> 1081.84
shameless as they do and you take that

1078.32 --> 1081.84
as an excuse to just

1083.039 --> 1096.559
go at it with all force

1094.799 --> 1098.559
all right anyway but yeah if you're not

1096.559 --> 1099.76
gonna like his voice yeah that's going

1098.559 --> 1109.84
to be

1099.76 --> 1109.84
not very pleasant then

1111.679 --> 1114.799
i think he knows not everyone loves him

1113.84 --> 1116.8799999999999
yeah of course

1114.799 --> 1119.36
but that's not it like do i do you think

1116.88 --> 1122.88
that i think that everybody loves me

1119.36 --> 1126.08
not at all i think that a lot of people

1122.88 --> 1129.2800000000002
here and chad do appreciate me

1126.08 --> 1132.8799999999999
but that's also because i spend more

1129.28 --> 1135.52
time and focus on my chat and i make it

1132.88 --> 1138.48
an integral part of my show

1135.52 --> 1140.4
nathan is different like he has

1138.48 --> 1142.32
panelists

1140.4 --> 1144.4
and the chat's just pretty much a sort

1142.32 --> 1151.84
of free-for-all so

1144.4 --> 1151.8400000000001
it's a different scenario

1155.76 --> 1165.84
eight wide wado

1176.84 --> 1180.799
so

1178.32 --> 1183.28
yeah and i don't think that that dmk

1180.799 --> 1185.679
2020 is going to explain about coming

1183.28 --> 1188.0
out of the liberty

1185.679 --> 1189.52
which made no sense to me and it's not

1188.0 --> 1194.32
the false flag attack

1189.52 --> 1196.24
ship in 1967 there here we go again

1194.32 --> 1197.4399999999998
i doubt it i don't think that chip's

1196.24 --> 1207.84
operational or

1197.44 --> 1207.8400000000001
in any harbor or anything

1208.72 --> 1214.72
maybe library

1211.77 --> 1217.76
[Music]

1214.72 --> 1217.76
the statue of

1218.24 --> 1221.919
yeah well we're gonna keep guessing

1219.76 --> 1235.679
because the guy is probably already not

1221.919 --> 1237.8400000000001
in chat anymore so

1235.679 --> 1240.0800000000002
i get the feeling it's not any physical

1237.84 --> 1242.48
place it's just some kind of a chat room

1240.08 --> 1245.12
or a discord chat room or something

1242.48 --> 1246.0
called liberty and then then he didn't

1245.12 --> 1248.7199999999998
expand on it

1246.0 --> 1248.72
so yeah

1257.84 --> 1265.1999999999998
oh you mean that

1261.76 --> 1268.559
he meant to say library

1265.2 --> 1272.0
but it autocorrected into liberty

1268.559 --> 1272.0
that could kind of make sense

1274.799 --> 1282.559
are any open yes yes there are

1279.2 --> 1285.3600000000001
ask robin stanley

1282.559 --> 1285.9189999999999
at least i think their libraries are

1285.36 --> 1287.84
open

1285.919 --> 1290.48
some of them should be open she just got

1287.84 --> 1294.08
a job

1290.48 --> 1305.84
at a library as a like an organizer

1294.08 --> 1305.84
so i think it's still open

1312.42 --> 1316.239
[Music]

1320.0 --> 1324.32
i think he's an aussie okay i don't know

1326.799 --> 1337.76
right so

1333.039 --> 1341.12
oh man i was all kind of late

1337.76 --> 1342.799
i don't know what it was yesterday i i

1341.12 --> 1346.7199999999998
guess i did go to bed

1342.799 --> 1349.84
earlier yesterday this night not so much

1346.72 --> 1353.2
so i wasn't as super well arrested this

1349.84 --> 1360.1589999999999
this morning or it wasn't even morning

1353.2 --> 1362.159
just at 12.

1360.159 --> 1365.6000000000001
why would he mention that australia's

1362.159 --> 1368.64
famous for house raising makes sense

1365.6 --> 1372.0
i didn't i didn't see that though i

1368.64 --> 1372.5590000000002
i must have missed that sentence but oh

1372.0 --> 1376.159
well

1372.559 --> 1378.0
let's move on to something flat earth

1376.159 --> 1380.5590000000002
related or

1378.0 --> 1380.559
i don't know

1387.2 --> 1392.64
talk about the world where we're at the

1389.84 --> 1395.039
united states and the

1392.64 --> 1396.7990000000002
the new democrat government and just

1395.039 --> 1399.84
this

1396.799 --> 1400.24
weird little details because i am now

1399.84 --> 1402.8799999999999
also

1400.24 --> 1404.64
what oh i am also following a bit of

1402.88 --> 1407.679
infowars just to see

1404.64 --> 1407.679
like what they're doing

1408.24 --> 1413.52
not expecting like super high tier

1411.84 --> 1417.1999999999998
information at this point because

1413.52 --> 1418.8799999999999
they're just kind of doing what

1417.2 --> 1420.4
what mainstream media much more

1418.88 --> 1422.96
extremely

1420.4 --> 1424.24
did when trump won it's just like

1422.96 --> 1425.919
pointing out how bad

1424.24 --> 1428.08
biden is pointing out how bad he is how

1425.919 --> 1430.96
bad he is but there are some weird

1428.08 --> 1434.559
little details that

1430.96 --> 1435.44
like for yeah two little things one was

1434.559 --> 1438.48
that

1435.44 --> 1441.039
he apparently has an earpiece in and

1438.48 --> 1442.24
at some point somebody in that earpiece

1441.039 --> 1444.1589999999999
told him like oh

1442.24 --> 1446.08
salute the marines and instead of

1444.159 --> 1449.8400000000001
saluting the marines he says

1446.08 --> 1452.08
salute the marines that was really silly

1449.84 --> 1454.48
that was really really silly also he

1452.08 --> 1454.48
didn't

1454.64 --> 1460.72
yeah there seems to be not as much for

1457.76 --> 1463.039
chemistry respect chemistry going on

1460.72 --> 1463.039
there

1463.84 --> 1469.1999999999998
so military doesn't seem to be overly

1466.159 --> 1471.679
enthusiastic with biden as president

1469.2 --> 1474.559
which is well not surprising with the

1471.679 --> 1474.5590000000002
background and all

1474.88 --> 1479.5200000000002
but yeah that pretty much stood out and

1476.799 --> 1479.52
that's about it

1482.159 --> 1487.1200000000001
other than democratic party like

1484.4 --> 1488.96
promising oh we'll go after the nazis

1487.12 --> 1491.9189999999999
everybody that has ever

1488.96 --> 1492.4
supported trump is going to be taken

1491.919 --> 1495.279
down

1492.4 --> 1495.919
and i don't know arrested like they were

1495.279 --> 1499.039
literal

1495.919 --> 1501.8400000000001
nazi war criminals or something they

1499.039 --> 1501.84
want to do that

1507.679 --> 1511.919
see the clip of signing executive orders

1510.0 --> 1513.6
well no i didn't see it i heard though

1511.919 --> 1517.44
that he was

1513.6 --> 1520.6399999999999
signing blank papers that was weird i

1517.44 --> 1520.64
don't know if that's true though

1521.12 --> 1528.799
also yeah yeah that was odd like owen

1524.32 --> 1530.6399999999999
benjamin uploaded this clip

1528.799 --> 1532.96
i don't know some kind of cnn news or

1530.64 --> 1536.0800000000002
something where it was said oh look

1532.96 --> 1540.88
biden is not wearing a mask

1536.08 --> 1544.559
and it was this really weird blurry cgi

1540.88 --> 1547.679
face of biden like a big npc

1544.559 --> 1550.24
head very squared

1547.679 --> 1552.3200000000002
not wearing a mask so it's almost like

1550.24 --> 1554.24
he was wearing a mask but there was this

1552.32 --> 1556.559
up like no no we have to show him not

1554.24 --> 1560.24
wearing a mask that is cool or something

1556.559 --> 1560.24
so they just projected

1560.32 --> 1563.76
a maskless face of biden over his head

1563.039 --> 1567.76
in the shot

1563.76 --> 1571.84
and that looked really freaky and weird

1567.76 --> 1571.84
anybody catch that

1581.919 --> 1587.8400000000001
i can link up to it

1585.279 --> 1587.84
let me see

1591.52 --> 1594.0
where is it

1595.679 --> 1602.4
that's so weird

1599.039 --> 1603.679
yeah so this is the clip i'm not gonna

1602.4 --> 1605.679
play it

1603.679 --> 1613.52
but i'm gonna post it so check it out

1605.679 --> 1615.919
that was so weird

1613.52 --> 1617.2
so i guess they're not ready for a cgi

1615.919 --> 1618.72
biden just yet

1617.2 --> 1627.8400000000001
because if you're looking at the quality

1618.72 --> 1627.84
of it that's just ridiculous

1644.88 --> 1649.0390000000002
right yeah well look

1650.24 --> 1654.08
what we can really expect to happen is

1652.399 --> 1656.2399999999998
that now everything all the

1654.08 --> 1658.399
sort of relations that were built with

1656.24 --> 1660.48
during trump

1658.399 --> 1662.2399999999998
it's all going to be reversed it's like

1660.48 --> 1663.039
going to be the opposite direction so

1662.24 --> 1666.24
now

1663.039 --> 1668.399
oh now both gennaro and brazil

1666.24 --> 1670.799
is going to get it like oh yeah yeah now

1668.399 --> 1671.52
we're finally going to stop that sort of

1670.799 --> 1674.48
[Â __Â ]

1671.52 --> 1676.6399999999999
and who knows who else around the world

1674.48 --> 1678.96
they're all gonna get it

1676.64 --> 1680.0
not as in war but they're going to get

1678.96 --> 1683.2
all negative

1680.0 --> 1684.24
publicity not help all that [Â __Â ] they're

1683.2 --> 1687.039
just gonna nag

1684.24 --> 1688.08
anyone that's not just an authoritarian

1687.039 --> 1692.24
communist

1688.08 --> 1694.0
scumbag demon pretty much that

1692.24 --> 1696.0
so all the countries that have managed

1694.0 --> 1697.919
to sort of liberate themselves from it

1696.0 --> 1699.44
even just temporary they're all gonna

1697.919 --> 1701.5200000000002
get it all the countries around the

1699.44 --> 1704.24
world are gonna get it

1701.52 --> 1707.2
because america just became pretty much

1704.24 --> 1707.2
fully communist

1709.2 --> 1716.32
or rather not fully rather overtly

1712.88 --> 1716.3200000000002
the overtness about it

1717.039 --> 1722.0
and that's what they do just a giant

1720.32 --> 1724.6399999999999
virtue signal to

1722.0 --> 1725.2
globalism and and communist and

1724.64 --> 1727.039
everything

1725.2 --> 1730.559
it's like oh yeah let's take down

1727.039 --> 1732.72
everybody that opposes it

1730.559 --> 1739.84
he looked very he looked creepy you mean

1732.72 --> 1739.84
in the video yeah i know

1742.88 --> 1753.8400000000001
yeah it's just a really odd little cliff

1756.0 --> 1762.48
okay oh a black helicopter

1760.159 --> 1762.48
goody

1763.279 --> 1781.84
look at that it's black

1767.44 --> 1781.8400000000001
see that yeah i see you

1790.41 --> 1794.48
[Music]

1792.64 --> 1796.0
yeah they are after me and then what you

1794.48 --> 1797.679
think they're gonna land on the roof

1796.0 --> 1809.84
here

1797.679 --> 1809.8400000000001
what are they gonna do nothing

1811.039 --> 1816.399
yeah also i'm starting to think that the

1813.36 --> 1818.9599999999998
entire curfew that's been declared here

1816.399 --> 1820.0
is a complete hoax because there were

1818.96 --> 1823.039
plenty of people

1820.0 --> 1825.919
in the middle of the night yesterday

1823.039 --> 1826.399
just walking i mean walking driving

1825.919 --> 1829.8400000000001
around

1826.399 --> 1833.52
in their cars there was a stupid dick

1829.84 --> 1836.799
sitting right there in this car

1833.52 --> 1839.6
playing music extremely loud up until

1836.799 --> 1840.1589999999999
four o'clock in the morning extremely

1839.6 --> 1844.559
loud

1840.159 --> 1848.48
nothing happened it's a freaking curfew

1844.559 --> 1851.76
like i i seriously considered like maybe

1848.48 --> 1853.76
the hell why is he circling here weird

1851.76 --> 1855.6
i was considering like what if i just

1853.76 --> 1859.12
called like the police

1855.6 --> 1861.6
on them but then yeah then i'd

1859.12 --> 1863.84
be contributing to the curfew nonsense

1861.6 --> 1864.399
although i i kind of wanted to just call

1863.84 --> 1867.4399999999998
them

1864.399 --> 1868.6399999999999
just to make complaints about noise like

1867.44 --> 1870.3990000000001
yeah they're making

1868.64 --> 1873.6000000000001
noise in the middle of the freaking

1870.399 --> 1873.6
night outside

1875.919 --> 1879.8400000000001
jesus what the [Â __Â ] is this

1899.919 --> 1902.3200000000002
damn it

1903.12 --> 1921.84
flying circles over there i don't know

1905.519 --> 1921.84
why but it's freaking noisy as [Â __Â ]

1921.919 --> 1924.72
go get what

1925.2 --> 1930.64
i'm just being a stupid guy saying like

1927.84 --> 1935.84
stop making noise like an old grumpy man

1930.64 --> 1935.8400000000001
like who gives a [Â __Â ]

1936.159 --> 1939.7600000000002
still gonna be flying circles

1944.159 --> 1949.8400000000001
i think maybe it's pissing off now

1946.84 --> 1949.84
whatever

1957.919 --> 1965.44
the hell

1963.279 --> 1967.6
i don't know how much of the mic picks

1965.44 --> 1968.24
up on this but like i can literally just

1967.6 --> 1971.84
feel

1968.24 --> 1976.56
the room vibrating on the denoise so

1971.84 --> 1980.319
this is really distracting

1976.56 --> 1980.319
[Music]

1986.799 --> 1990.96
right when lockdown started last year in

1988.88 --> 1994.72
uk helicopters every day well

1990.96 --> 1996.3990000000001
look helicopters fly over here regularly

1994.72 --> 1998.799
but yeah what are they gonna do with the

1996.399 --> 1999.5189999999998
freaking curfew it's not a curfew right

1998.799 --> 2005.679
now

1999.519 --> 2009.44
so it makes no damn sense

2005.679 --> 2011.279
and i don't know why that freaking

2009.44 --> 2013.76
helicopter is flying

2011.279 --> 2019.84
right over there in a freaking circle

2013.76 --> 2019.84
what the [Â __Â ] are you doing there

2031.6 --> 2047.84
he's even making little circles it's

2033.76 --> 2047.84
like what are you doing there

2058.159 --> 2062.48
looking for some criminals well you

2059.919 --> 2064.24
don't look for criminals at a distance

2062.48 --> 2066.72
like that

2064.24 --> 2068.24
like what they're gonna identify it at

2066.72 --> 2075.839
that distance

2068.24 --> 2075.839
makes no sense

2083.919 --> 2087.5989999999997
right and by the way the helicopter

2086.879 --> 2091.839
doesn't have

2087.599 --> 2093.76
like recognizable

2091.839 --> 2095.599
high-tech equipment or anything

2093.76 --> 2097.44
installed onto it

2095.599 --> 2099.599
it just seems pretty smooth so there's

2097.44 --> 2102.48
no weird

2099.599 --> 2104.56
like scanning machine or whatever on

2102.48 --> 2107.52
there

2104.56 --> 2117.839
so it just seems to be just flying i

2107.52 --> 2117.839
don't know why he's doing that

2132.0 --> 2145.839
finally stop surfing now

2156.839 --> 2159.839
ugh

2198.839 --> 2201.839
hello

2225.599 --> 2244.6400000000003
this is really starting to piss me off

2242.4 --> 2247.44
so i'm just closing dornie until he

2244.64 --> 2247.44
pisses off

2248.64 --> 2253.839
right so let's move on to say flat earth

2254.48 --> 2259.68
yeah i think he can distract me

2257.92 --> 2261.76
what you think that some stupid

2259.68 --> 2264.3999999999996
helicopter is gonna prevent me from

2261.76 --> 2265.2000000000003
sharing with the world that america just

2264.4 --> 2268.32
became an

2265.2 --> 2271.2799999999997
overt government an overtly

2268.32 --> 2271.92
communist government that is gonna

2271.28 --> 2274.96
attack

2271.92 --> 2276.7200000000003
anything that isn't globalist yeah i'm

2274.96 --> 2278.64
not gonna stop talking about it

2276.72 --> 2281.1189999999997
yeah it's called the communist takeover

2278.64 --> 2285.1189999999997
yeah we've already had that

2281.119 --> 2287.44
right now they have it

2285.119 --> 2290.2400000000002
and since they and as u.s has been

2287.44 --> 2292.64
designated as like an acting arm

2290.24 --> 2294.56
for everything out there yeah that's

2292.64 --> 2296.16
gonna happen and i will talk about it

2294.56 --> 2300.32
i'm going to talk about

2296.16 --> 2302.24
the communist attack

2300.32 --> 2303.839
on the rest of the world that they are

2302.24 --> 2305.68
going to do yeah i will

2303.839 --> 2307.7599999999998
keep talking about i also will keep

2305.68 --> 2311.2799999999997
talking about flat earth that the earth

2307.76 --> 2311.28
is actually not a sphere

2311.44 --> 2319.52
right and that huge chunk of the system

2316.0 --> 2326.4
is filled with provable lies

2319.52 --> 2329.7599999999998
that persist for almost 100 years now

2326.4 --> 2335.359
right and those lies

2329.76 --> 2335.3590000000004
turn people dumb or even into religious

2338.839 --> 2342.0789999999997
fanatics

2340.4 --> 2344.1600000000003
yeah the evidence earth being flat

2342.079 --> 2347.2000000000003
there's no geometrical curve

2344.16 --> 2347.2
there's no curvature

2347.92 --> 2352.7200000000003
ballers now even have the gall to say

2350.4 --> 2356.88
they never even claimed it

2352.72 --> 2359.9199999999996
right so there isn't any because

2356.88 --> 2363.2000000000003
curve is not going to alter

2359.92 --> 2365.28
either it is there or it's not it's not

2363.2 --> 2368.96
going to change

2365.28 --> 2372.32
so it's flat it's flat you can see

2368.96 --> 2373.76
too far for a geometry of any spherical

2372.32 --> 2375.599
nature

2373.76 --> 2377.0400000000004
and that can never happen and there is

2375.599 --> 2380.2400000000002
no optical

2377.04 --> 2382.64
effect that is going to allow that to be

2380.24 --> 2385.7599999999998
possible on a sphere

2382.64 --> 2386.56
terrestrial refraction is a myth first

2385.76 --> 2390.32
and foremost

2386.56 --> 2393.44
it's also a paradox mathematically

2390.32 --> 2396.88
a paradox it assumes

2393.44 --> 2399.839
the r within it

2396.88 --> 2401.44
right the r is within the system of

2399.839 --> 2404.0
terrestrial refraction

2401.44 --> 2405.04
even though terrestrial refraction is

2404.0 --> 2409.04
sometimes now

2405.04 --> 2411.68
much more sparingly forwarded as a proof

2409.04 --> 2414.0
as to how r was established which makes

2411.68 --> 2414.7999999999997
it a paradox because it already assumes

2414.0 --> 2418.079
it

2414.8 --> 2418.5600000000004
within its proof supposedly which makes

2418.079 --> 2420.88
it

2418.56 --> 2422.96
not viable because it assumes it so it's

2420.88 --> 2426.079
a paradox

2422.96 --> 2428.16
right there is no proof for a radius

2426.079 --> 2429.92
and the geometrical curve has been

2428.16 --> 2431.5989999999997
dispelled

2429.92 --> 2434.079
through the black swan there's your

2431.599 --> 2434.079
evidence

2435.76 --> 2439.01
ah see [Â __Â ] helicopters finally

2438.16 --> 2442.049
pissed off

2439.01 --> 2442.0490000000004
[Music]

2442.8 --> 2445.04
good

2450.24 --> 2455.2
all right jimmy boy

2453.52 --> 2457.119
why didn't you tell me then what is oh

2455.2 --> 2457.9199999999996
refraction yeah that's what i just

2457.119 --> 2461.6800000000003
talked about

2457.92 --> 2463.52
dumbass i literally just said that are

2461.68 --> 2465.7599999999998
you [Â __Â ] deaf

2463.52 --> 2468.4
do you have my show on mute are you just

2465.76 --> 2471.599
here to nag other people in chat

2468.4 --> 2472.56
right i just literally addressed that in

2471.599 --> 2474.48
detail

2472.56 --> 2475.68
terrestrial refraction how it is a

2474.48 --> 2479.2
paradox

2475.68 --> 2482.16
right and exactly how by assuming

2479.2 --> 2482.8799999999997
r when it's supposed to set out to prove

2482.16 --> 2484.96
r

2482.88 --> 2486.0
yeah that's terrestrial refraction it's

2484.96 --> 2490.0
a paradox

2486.0 --> 2494.0
it's an non-actual optical effect

2490.0 --> 2497.599
it's not real it's conjured it's fake

2494.0 --> 2500.56
and it assumes are within the formula

2497.599 --> 2502.2400000000002
yeah refraction is not a proof of

2500.56 --> 2504.64
curvature

2502.24 --> 2505.68
it's a proof that yeah ballers are

2504.64 --> 2508.96
delusional

2505.68 --> 2511.7599999999998
and they conjure up imaginary

2508.96 --> 2513.359
physical effects in order to justify the

2511.76 --> 2515.76
missing curvature

2513.359 --> 2516.88
and the lack of geometrical natural

2515.76 --> 2523.8390000000004
consequences

2516.88 --> 2523.839
out there that's what it is

2526.8 --> 2530.1600000000003
anything else jimmy boy

2531.28 --> 2536.5600000000004
hello by the way julio pebble good to

2532.96 --> 2539.52
see you

2536.56 --> 2540.96
the bending of light is a thing no no

2539.52 --> 2543.839
it's not

2540.96 --> 2544.48
the alteration of a light pathway is a

2543.839 --> 2546.96
thing

2544.48 --> 2549.359
right yeah that's called refraction

2546.96 --> 2552.7200000000003
bending in circular fashion

2549.359 --> 2555.92
no no it is not

2552.72 --> 2558.72
no evidence right

2555.92 --> 2560.48
it's only any kind of bending in a

2558.72 --> 2563.2799999999997
circular fashion you have to get

2560.48 --> 2564.319
really freaky with the terrain the light

2563.28 --> 2566.96
is passing through

2564.319 --> 2568.16
really freaky something that is not

2566.96 --> 2571.44
present in the world at

2568.16 --> 2575.839
any stage ever not even close

2571.44 --> 2575.839
because yeah in a horizontal sense

2576.319 --> 2580.64
the amount of refraction is going to be

2578.24 --> 2583.839
pretty persistent in a horizontal

2580.64 --> 2586.24
sense right well refraction supposedly

2583.839 --> 2590.0789999999997
leading to some kind of a curve

2586.24 --> 2593.5989999999997
requires in a horizontal sense

2590.079 --> 2595.8390000000004
none consistent

2593.599 --> 2599.04
right it requires to be non-consistent

2595.839 --> 2602.24
has to be several different types of

2599.04 --> 2605.04
uh refractive indexes

2602.24 --> 2606.24
continually in order for light to even

2605.04 --> 2608.72
sort a bend

2606.24 --> 2610.24
in a circular fashion and then it

2608.72 --> 2613.2
doesn't really work out either

2610.24 --> 2614.72
right well guess what out here in the

2613.2 --> 2617.839
world

2614.72 --> 2622.24
there are no such conditions ever under

2617.839 --> 2624.88
any circumstances ever you understand

2622.24 --> 2624.8799999999997
jimmy boy

2625.359 --> 2631.2
light does not bend in circular fashion

2628.72 --> 2632.16
in the natural world out there it does

2631.2 --> 2635.2799999999997
not

2632.16 --> 2638.3999999999996
to get really weird

2635.28 --> 2641.0400000000004
and machination like yeah you have to

2638.4 --> 2642.7200000000003
create some really weird unnatural setup

2641.04 --> 2646.24
in order to demonstrate even

2642.72 --> 2648.16
slight curve like that circular fashion

2646.24 --> 2649.5989999999997
it doesn't happen in the natural world

2648.16 --> 2652.64
out there it does not it

2649.599 --> 2654.8
never happens out there light may

2652.64 --> 2656.0789999999997
alter its path you might call that

2654.8 --> 2657.8390000000004
bending it's just

2656.079 --> 2659.3590000000004
changing a corner and depends on the

2657.839 --> 2662.56
refraction index

2659.359 --> 2663.44
through a transition a transition of the

2662.56 --> 2665.839
medium

2663.44 --> 2667.68
from one type of material into a

2665.839 --> 2670.16
completely different type of material

2667.68 --> 2673.359
with a different refraction index

2670.16 --> 2677.1189999999997
right and that alters alters

2673.359 --> 2680.64
a corner change of the pathway of light

2677.119 --> 2681.599
it does not cause it to bend in circular

2680.64 --> 2685.44
fashion

2681.599 --> 2691.839
nothing does in the natural world

2685.44 --> 2691.839
nothing does right

2706.8 --> 2710.5600000000004
you can call him a dumbass if you like

2708.88 --> 2713.04
[Â __Â ] wassel but it seems kind of

2710.56 --> 2717.119
superfluous at this point

2713.04 --> 2719.44
i'm just addressing his arguments

2717.119 --> 2722.4
and then leave him to conclude that he

2719.44 --> 2724.48
is a dumbass on his own

2722.4 --> 2726.56
we're just gonna tell him he is a dumb

2724.48 --> 2728.2400000000002
ass straight to his face

2726.56 --> 2729.68
it's not much of an argument even though

2728.24 --> 2732.56
it's true

2729.68 --> 2734.0
that's only going to spur him to

2732.56 --> 2737.2799999999997
counter-react and

2734.0 --> 2738.72
to latch onto the non-arguing part of

2737.28 --> 2740.8
the argument right

2738.72 --> 2741.7599999999998
which is what ballers do they go at home

2740.8 --> 2743.76
so if you

2741.76 --> 2745.76
present something at home even though

2743.76 --> 2748.7200000000003
it's true it'll just give him an

2745.76 --> 2749.119
opportunity to add home back at you and

2748.72 --> 2752.56
then

2749.119 --> 2754.7200000000003
move away from the complete failure of

2752.56 --> 2761.839
the argument he presented

2754.72 --> 2761.839
so i recommend against it

2772.839 --> 2775.839
so

2777.52 --> 2784.0
see see there you go see told you

2780.88 --> 2784.0
doji was gonna happen

2786.96 --> 2794.8
so don't be seduced when you're winning

2790.56 --> 2798.0789999999997
and the opponent is floundering

2794.8 --> 2801.1600000000003
failing don't make it

2798.079 --> 2803.76
at home don't step away from the total

2801.16 --> 2805.7599999999998
disintegrating argument from them

2803.76 --> 2807.6800000000003
don't step away don't call them a

2805.76 --> 2810.88
dumbass don't point out the

2807.68 --> 2814.0
absolute aggravatingly obvious

2810.88 --> 2817.6800000000003
because it only gives them a

2814.0 --> 2821.52
way out don't you get it

2817.68 --> 2822.56
stop biting stop letting lucifer dictate

2821.52 --> 2825.04
where things go

2822.56 --> 2826.16
for you right because that's what it is

2825.04 --> 2829.44
it's a seduction

2826.16 --> 2832.64
oh you want to point out the obvious why

2829.44 --> 2834.56
because it makes you feel better because

2832.64 --> 2837.1189999999997
you're not that much of a dumbass

2834.56 --> 2838.0789999999997
well guess what by giving in to that

2837.119 --> 2841.04
seduction

2838.079 --> 2842.96
you just gave him a way out not a way

2841.04 --> 2846.8
out of his stupidity but away

2842.96 --> 2849.2
away from it so that it actually doesn't

2846.8 --> 2851.8390000000004
sink in as much as when you wouldn't

2849.2 --> 2851.839
point it out

2856.839 --> 2859.839
right

2870.24 --> 2873.2799999999997
right yeah but jimmy boy it's really

2872.079 --> 2875.92
cute with the at home

2873.28 --> 2876.8
i'm not going there i just gave an

2875.92 --> 2880.0
example

2876.8 --> 2882.0
didn't address you as such right

2880.0 --> 2884.319
but just for the record there is no

2882.0 --> 2886.96
terrestrial refraction

2884.319 --> 2889.68
it assumes the radius of earth within

2886.96 --> 2889.68
the formula

2898.839 --> 2901.839
so

2903.04 --> 2908.48
wow makes it even more funnier well

2906.559 --> 2909.76
if you're going to say it like that then

2908.48 --> 2911.599
i'd have to agree

2909.76 --> 2912.88
because that's a pretty dumb way to say

2911.599 --> 2917.04
things

2912.88 --> 2917.04
very incorrect english so

2922.96 --> 2926.7200000000003
hello robin stanley by the way good

2926.839 --> 2929.839
morning

2940.24 --> 2944.0789999999997
nobody's saying you did jimmy boy

2945.599 --> 2950.48
i know you are now currently engaging on

2948.559 --> 2952.48
that train of distraction because

2950.48 --> 2955.44
somebody pointed some out some

2952.48 --> 2956.319
at home potential so now you've already

2955.44 --> 2958.8
hopped

2956.319 --> 2960.4
to that position as to where did i say

2958.8 --> 2963.599
it even though nobody did

2960.4 --> 2964.7200000000003
say you were at homing just say you

2963.599 --> 2967.839
would

2964.72 --> 2969.839
if we would again engage in at home

2967.839 --> 2971.04
so you're you're ahead of your

2969.839 --> 2985.32
standardized

2971.04 --> 2988.499
baller response program there jimmy boy

2985.32 --> 2988.4990000000003
[Music]

2993.27 --> 2996.369
[Music]

3017.76 --> 3020.8
if you want you can try to prove wrong

3019.839 --> 3024.319
what i just

3020.8 --> 3025.04
said like not right last few minutes but

3024.319 --> 3028.88
before that

3025.04 --> 3030.64
you can try right you can try to present

3028.88 --> 3035.52
some kind of conditions in which

3030.64 --> 3039.359
light visually bends in a circle

3035.52 --> 3041.7599999999998
and then try to justify how that equates

3039.359 --> 3044.0
to the natural conditions out there you

3041.76 --> 3055.8390000000004
can try if you like

3044.0 --> 3055.839
wish you the best of luck

3059.52 --> 3065.92
oh my views you don't you don't agree

3063.359 --> 3067.119
with my views on reference it's not a

3065.92 --> 3069.52
freaking view

3067.119 --> 3071.04
although refraction does involve view

3069.52 --> 3074.0
right in the literal sense

3071.04 --> 3076.48
it's not my view on refraction this is

3074.0 --> 3079.92
what refraction is

3076.48 --> 3080.88
so it's a standard deviation upon medium

3079.92 --> 3084.16
change

3080.88 --> 3087.599
is an angle alteration it's not a

3084.16 --> 3088.96
curve light does not curve in circular

3087.599 --> 3092.1600000000003
fashion

3088.96 --> 3093.52
oh you didn't see it bends in a circle

3092.16 --> 3096.72
did you

3093.52 --> 3099.04
oh so it doesn't well guess what that's

3096.72 --> 3101.839
exactly what your restaurant refraction

3099.04 --> 3101.839
is supposed to do

3102.88 --> 3108.2400000000002
it's supposed to bend in a circle around

3105.92 --> 3111.04
this presupposed spherical earth

3108.24 --> 3111.7599999999998
in order to make it appear as if it were

3111.04 --> 3114.96
flat

3111.76 --> 3118.559
that is what terrestrial refraction

3114.96 --> 3121.76
is jimmy boy now you might not have to

3118.559 --> 3124.8
say that that's still the claim

3121.76 --> 3127.92
that's still the mechanic of it as being

3124.8 --> 3131.52
utilized by ballers out there

3127.92 --> 3132.559
no no it's not a response yes yes that

3131.52 --> 3135.119
is what it is

3132.559 --> 3136.96
it's exactly what it is been dealing

3135.119 --> 3141.119
with it on a daily basis for

3136.96 --> 3143.76
several years on a daily basis

3141.119 --> 3144.4
right other ballers with other flat

3143.76 --> 3147.5200000000004
earthers

3144.4 --> 3148.8
we worked it out we looked it up figured

3147.52 --> 3152.24
out how it works

3148.8 --> 3154.319
we played around with it that is how it

3152.24 --> 3157.7599999999998
works jimmy boy

3154.319 --> 3159.68
that's actual optics actual optics the

3157.76 --> 3163.2000000000003
physics of optics

3159.68 --> 3165.7599999999998
light does not travel in a circular

3163.2 --> 3167.359
like curve it does not moves in a

3165.76 --> 3170.88
straight line

3167.359 --> 3174.7999999999997
and its path can be deviated

3170.88 --> 3178.079
can be altered not in a circular way it

3174.8 --> 3181.2000000000003
never does it's just a corner change

3178.079 --> 3184.079
it's because of refraction index

3181.2 --> 3185.9199999999996
the medium is going to go through has a

3184.079 --> 3187.92
completely different type of

3185.92 --> 3190.0
well refraction index usually has to do

3187.92 --> 3193.359
with the density also

3190.0 --> 3194.72
then yeah the light path upon entering

3193.359 --> 3197.92
the new medium

3194.72 --> 3198.48
will change in angle and then if it were

3197.92 --> 3201.92
to

3198.48 --> 3205.04
leave that same medium on the other side

3201.92 --> 3210.16
into the same medium as yeah like say

3205.04 --> 3214.16
air then it'll change back its angle

3210.16 --> 3214.16
that's what refraction does

3214.319 --> 3222.079
it requires a medium alteration

3217.52 --> 3225.599
a hard edged medium alteration

3222.079 --> 3228.88
and it changes the angle of light travel

3225.599 --> 3231.3590000000004
not in a circular fashion which is

3228.88 --> 3233.839
what terrestrial refraction claims and

3231.359 --> 3236.64
requires in order to justify

3233.839 --> 3237.52
not seeing a geometrical curve but

3236.64 --> 3240.7999999999997
incredibly

3237.52 --> 3242.559
far sided flat surfaces

3240.8 --> 3244.079
yeah that's terrestrial refraction

3242.559 --> 3247.52
that's what you

3244.079 --> 3250.8
require to justify why the earth

3247.52 --> 3254.319
is not looking exactly like a ball

3250.8 --> 3254.319
at all times which it should

3254.48 --> 3265.839
if it was actually a ball

3276.48 --> 3279.839
why didn't i use randy's camera to make

3278.319 --> 3284.0
any observations

3279.839 --> 3286.799
because i didn't want to that's why

3284.0 --> 3293.839
because i don't care too many

3286.799 --> 3293.839
observations anyway

3296.079 --> 3299.44
it's not because i was afraid i would

3298.4 --> 3302.799
not find

3299.44 --> 3304.559
the world to be flat right jamie boy

3302.799 --> 3305.44
that's not the reason for me not to use

3304.559 --> 3307.6800000000003
the camera

3305.44 --> 3308.7200000000003
because as a flat earther i am not

3307.68 --> 3311.44
desperate

3308.72 --> 3312.72
to find that elusive proof that the

3311.44 --> 3315.52
earth is flat

3312.72 --> 3317.24
because the earth is overwhelmingly

3315.52 --> 3320.16
proven flat

3317.24 --> 3324.64
overwhelmingly through observation

3320.16 --> 3326.8799999999997
through actual science through physics

3324.64 --> 3329.2799999999997
from calculations through back

3326.88 --> 3330.319
engineering baller machinations what are

3329.28 --> 3333.8390000000004
they really

3330.319 --> 3335.119
yeah overwhelming proof the earth is

3333.839 --> 3338.5589999999997
flat i don't need to go

3335.119 --> 3341.6800000000003
out and film the horizon

3338.559 --> 3342.48
to prove to myself the earth is flat it

3341.68 --> 3345.52
cannot be

3342.48 --> 3348.319
any other way it is flat

3345.52 --> 3350.96
everything the physical reality in

3348.319 --> 3353.44
itself up to the fundamental level

3350.96 --> 3354.079
on every aspect proves the earth is

3353.44 --> 3357.44
[Â __Â ]

3354.079 --> 3363.8390000000004
flat and that's that there is

3357.44 --> 3363.839
no alternative

3369.04 --> 3374.0
all right yeah here we go again i did

3371.2 --> 3375.7599999999998
have some moon footage that's right

3374.0 --> 3377.76
but that's not gonna really prove the

3375.76 --> 3380.079
earth is flat or anything

3377.76 --> 3380.079
you know

3381.28 --> 3391.8390000000004
just proves the moon is weird

3395.46 --> 3398.599
[Music]

3403.839 --> 3407.2
yeah george sanford i know there's

3405.599 --> 3408.799
thousands of black swan photos the

3407.2 --> 3411.4399999999996
problem is though is that

3408.799 --> 3413.28
jimmy boy in chat here still believes in

3411.44 --> 3415.2000000000003
terrestrial refraction even though i

3413.28 --> 3418.3190000000004
just

3415.2 --> 3420.3999999999996
explained to him in detail in detail

3418.319 --> 3422.16
why it's absolutely impossible because

3420.4 --> 3426.319
it does not abide to

3422.16 --> 3432.319
natural optics it doesn't work like that

3426.319 --> 3436.0
at all

3432.319 --> 3438.64
oh well i'm sorry yes i rely on others

3436.0 --> 3439.04
i rely on others just like the ballers

3438.64 --> 3441.839
do

3439.04 --> 3443.48
there's one distinct difference though i

3441.839 --> 3447.04
don't rely on others

3443.48 --> 3448.16
intellectually and i can rely on them to

3447.04 --> 3452.0
basically

3448.16 --> 3454.0
find visual physical proof out there

3452.0 --> 3456.4
black swan photographs i don't need to

3454.0 --> 3458.559
make a black swan photograph myself

3456.4 --> 3460.7200000000003
in order to know that there is such a

3458.559 --> 3463.76
thing as a black swan photograph

3460.72 --> 3463.7599999999998
right that's the difference

3469.28 --> 3475.3590000000004
but yeah i do rely on others because i'm

3472.079 --> 3477.3590000000004
not the only person out here

3475.359 --> 3479.5989999999997
and hey it's actually kind of easy

3477.359 --> 3481.2799999999997
because there's people out there that

3479.599 --> 3484.0
are really good at it they're really

3481.28 --> 3484.6400000000003
good at doing that stuff with the p900

3484.0 --> 3486.559
out there

3484.64 --> 3488.0789999999997
they love doing it they live in a

3486.559 --> 3490.6400000000003
country where it's a lot warmer

3488.079 --> 3492.559
a lot more pleasant to actually do that

3490.64 --> 3493.839
here not so much i don't live at the

3492.559 --> 3495.2000000000003
coast and i live in the freaking

3493.839 --> 3498.319
netherlands

3495.2 --> 3499.359
which it's not yeah it's very rainy on

3498.319 --> 3504.5589999999997
average

3499.359 --> 3508.5589999999997
so yeah that's right i rely on others

3504.559 --> 3511.0400000000004
right i also rely on others for my food

3508.559 --> 3513.8390000000004
right i go to a supermarket that's not

3511.04 --> 3516.88
me making that food so i rely on others

3513.839 --> 3518.64
that's right i live in a big city

3516.88 --> 3522.319
there's a lot of things that are done

3518.64 --> 3526.16
i rely on workers to

3522.319 --> 3529.2799999999997
maintain this the sewers right

3526.16 --> 3531.44
all that so yeah i rely on others that's

3529.28 --> 3533.92
right i don't

3531.44 --> 3535.92
need others though to prove to me the

3533.92 --> 3538.48
earth is flat because i know it's flat i

3535.92 --> 3541.28
figured that one out myself

3538.48 --> 3542.2400000000002
also by the way thanks to others for

3541.28 --> 3545.0400000000004
working it out

3542.24 --> 3545.839
me being part of that and i know it i

3545.04 --> 3549.52
don't need

3545.839 --> 3552.0789999999997
others intellects to help me prove the

3549.52 --> 3559.839
earth is flat i got everything i need

3552.079 --> 3559.8390000000004
for that right here

3561.28 --> 3567.44
okay robin stanley said natural

3565.52 --> 3569.52
thought experiment show me a natural

3567.44 --> 3573.04
round object that i can't

3569.52 --> 3577.599
see around as a

3573.04 --> 3577.599
five foot five tall human what

3579.76 --> 3587.8390000000004
i don't really understand the question

3594.559 --> 3601.52
i think that any object is going to have

3597.599 --> 3604.6400000000003
a geometrical horizon

3601.52 --> 3606.16
and you can't see the back side of a

3604.64 --> 3608.64
ball that you're looking at

3606.16 --> 3609.2
if that's what you're asking now you can

3608.64 --> 3613.2799999999997
never

3609.2 --> 3614.48
see around the horizon of the object

3613.28 --> 3616.079
you're looking at

3614.48 --> 3618.0
doesn't work that way it's always going

3616.079 --> 3619.599
to cut off view you're not going to see

3618.0 --> 3621.839
that part

3619.599 --> 3623.2000000000003
and no amount of weather conditions is

3621.839 --> 3624.96
going to make you see

3623.2 --> 3629.839
the other side of that ball you're

3624.96 --> 3629.839
looking at so

3637.04 --> 3646.4
that now i think jimmy boy is now just

3641.119 --> 3649.52
squirming around in his baller sewers

3646.4 --> 3651.359
like if you're gonna ask

3649.52 --> 3653.119
why are there black swans why not white

3651.359 --> 3654.88
zones that means he doesn't understand

3653.119 --> 3657.44
the argument that means he

3654.88 --> 3658.2400000000002
didn't really want to inform himself

3657.44 --> 3660.7200000000003
which means

3658.24 --> 3661.839
he is a complete waste of our time

3660.72 --> 3665.839
because you can't

3661.839 --> 3666.799
inform a person that refuses to be

3665.839 --> 3670.16
informed

3666.799 --> 3672.559
that refuses to learn if you don't know

3670.16 --> 3675.5989999999997
what the black swan argument is which is

3672.559 --> 3679.119
a technical argument

3675.599 --> 3680.96
right then why are we even

3679.119 --> 3682.2400000000002
entertaining you here why are we even

3680.96 --> 3685.839
rebutting you

3682.24 --> 3685.839
because you're a waste of time

3688.48 --> 3691.92
yeah it's been a pleasure chatting with

3690.24 --> 3693.5989999999997
you too

3691.92 --> 3699.839
come back with some proof for the ball

3693.599 --> 3699.839
next time if you bring it up

3707.04 --> 3713.839
hello my new god

3719.52 --> 3722.96
let's now use whispering black swan to

3721.68 --> 3725.2
him when he

3722.96 --> 3726.48
purposely does not understand the black

3725.2 --> 3730.0
swan argument

3726.48 --> 3730.96
right yeah it's a great mechanism it's a

3730.0 --> 3733.52
great proof

3730.96 --> 3735.52
but yeah for a baller if they do not

3733.52 --> 3738.64
want to understand it

3735.52 --> 3740.559
then it's no use holding it up against

3738.64 --> 3741.52
them because they don't even recognize

3740.559 --> 3744.559
what it means

3741.52 --> 3746.48
and you can't make them understand

3744.559 --> 3748.96
right because if you would i know this

3746.48 --> 3750.2400000000002
process if i'm now going to engage to

3748.96 --> 3752.16
step by step

3750.24 --> 3753.7599999999998
explaining what the black swan argument

3752.16 --> 3756.16
is at the end of it

3753.76 --> 3757.5200000000004
you will forgotten the beginning of my

3756.16 --> 3759.359
explanation

3757.52 --> 3760.72
and then the next day he'll be back

3759.359 --> 3769.839
saying the same [Â __Â ]

3760.72 --> 3769.839
over and over again

3772.799 --> 3776.559
yeah bye jimmy look into the black swan

3775.599 --> 3779.2000000000003
argument

3776.559 --> 3783.119
figure out what it actually means and

3779.2 --> 3787.2799999999997
then come back at us

3783.119 --> 3787.28
if i see you in my chat again i will ask

3787.599 --> 3797.839
and you better answer correctly

3810.4 --> 3815.92
right well by saying that you prove

3813.44 --> 3817.76
you do not understand the black swan

3815.92 --> 3819.599
because the black swan has nothing to do

3817.76 --> 3821.5200000000004
with a freaking blurry image of

3819.599 --> 3823.599
refraction

3821.52 --> 3825.0389999999998
we get wrong that's not the black zone

3823.599 --> 3827.039
argument you dumbass

3825.039 --> 3829.3590000000004
so you don't understand the black swan

3827.039 --> 3830.079
go [Â __Â ] do your research and get back

3829.359 --> 3832.24
here

3830.079 --> 3833.599
if you say it incorrectly the next time

3832.24 --> 3835.4399999999996
i'm banning you

3833.599 --> 3837.119
i'm not putting up with your stupid

3835.44 --> 3839.599
misinformation [Â __Â ]

3837.119 --> 3840.96
and your gaslighting nonsense about you

3839.599 --> 3843.039
knowing the black swan

3840.96 --> 3844.64
you literally in the same sentence prove

3843.039 --> 3846.4
you don't understand the black swan so

3844.64 --> 3848.96
get the [Â __Â ] out

3846.4 --> 3850.4
educate yourself and get back here or

3848.96 --> 3853.68
stay the [Â __Â ] out

3850.4 --> 3855.92
if you don't want to learn then get out

3853.68 --> 3867.839
go wallow in your baller retardation

3855.92 --> 3867.839
with other fools

3868.45 --> 3871.739
[Music]

3874.559 --> 3881.8390000000004
yeah get the [Â __Â ] out

3886.73 --> 3889.7690000000002
[Music]

3891.44 --> 3895.44
i'm just banning him because he's not

3893.359 --> 3897.68
going to inform himself he was going to

3895.44 --> 3900.079
literally spend the next 10 minutes

3897.68 --> 3901.9199999999996
whining to us about how we don't have an

3900.079 --> 3904.0
argument blah blah blah blah all that

3901.92 --> 3908.7200000000003
crap well i'm not sitting through that

3904.0 --> 3911.44
you could just get the [Â __Â ] out

3908.72 --> 3912.0789999999997
[Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] we don't give a [Â __Â ]

3911.44 --> 3915.52
about your

3912.079 --> 3917.559
inability to understand arguments

3915.52 --> 3919.839
don't give a [Â __Â ] for your

3917.559 --> 3923.28
misinterpretations of them

3919.839 --> 3926.64
you're a [Â __Â ]

3923.28 --> 3932.1600000000003
we don't care for you you can literally

3926.64 --> 3932.16
drop dead we don't care for your

3934.839 --> 3937.839
stupidity

3938.64 --> 3942.24
take the vaccine while you can

3943.2 --> 3948.3999999999996
so here it's really good for you maybe

3945.119 --> 3948.4
you'll buy that one too

3948.839 --> 3953.32
dumbass

3950.17 --> 3953.32
[Music]

3959.68 --> 3965.839
yeah well he was leaving by me kicking

3962.079 --> 3965.8390000000004
him out

3973.039 --> 3977.44
yeah don't go all the way over there my

3975.28 --> 3979.6800000000003
new god

3977.44 --> 3981.44
they're not your enemies they're just

3979.68 --> 3983.7599999999998
[Â __Â ] annoying

3981.44 --> 3985.119
they're too stupid to be your enemy

3983.76 --> 3987.76
don't you understand

3985.119 --> 3988.559
they have no weaponry an enemy is a

3987.76 --> 3991.2000000000003
threat

3988.559 --> 3991.76
they are literally not a threat they're

3991.2 --> 3995.1189999999997
just

3991.76 --> 3997.76
[Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] that's all

3995.119 --> 3998.319
you don't have to kill a [Â __Â ] you just

3997.76 --> 4001.599
have to

3998.319 --> 4004.88
not give them any attention and let them

4001.599 --> 4006.48
[Â __Â ] off squirt on their own with other

4004.88 --> 4009.44
retards

4006.48 --> 4010.16
till they're all just blubbered out of

4009.44 --> 4013.28
reality

4010.16 --> 4014.16
just leave them alone they're not your

4013.28 --> 4016.7200000000003
enemy

4014.16 --> 4017.2799999999997
they don't pose any threat they have

4016.72 --> 4020.24
nothing

4017.28 --> 4020.88
but just stupid distraction and annoying

4020.24 --> 4024.8799999999997
us

4020.88 --> 4024.88
being a nuisance is the worst they can

4032.839 --> 4049.839
do

4035.359 --> 4049.839
all right

4060.319 --> 4064.319
all right well my god look i talked

4063.599 --> 4066.559
about the

4064.319 --> 4068.079
the vaccination and all that yesterday

4066.559 --> 4070.6400000000003
pretty elaborately

4068.079 --> 4073.119
it's technically not even a vaccine it's

4070.64 --> 4073.1189999999997
just not

4075.2 --> 4081.1189999999997
it it doesn't abide by the very

4078.4 --> 4081.76
original concept of vaccination it's

4081.119 --> 4085.039
just

4081.76 --> 4087.2000000000003
a medical experiment oh

4085.039 --> 4088.4
you want to be liberal you want to be a

4087.2 --> 4091.7599999999998
little special

4088.4 --> 4094.64
the new race you wanna be the new

4091.76 --> 4097.6
race that's gonna overtake humanity

4094.64 --> 4100.719
replace those stupid stupid bad

4097.6 --> 4105.120000000001
bad humans right take the

4100.719 --> 4109.359
[Â __Â ] medical experiment and die

4105.12 --> 4112.3189999999995
go ahead why don't you ascend into the

4109.359 --> 4115.839
new dimension of being

4112.319 --> 4118.400000000001
die get the [Â __Â ] out we don't need your

4115.839 --> 4120.48
stupid retardation

4118.4 --> 4121.44
we'd like to deal with the real world

4120.48 --> 4124.3189999999995
here

4121.44 --> 4125.2789999999995
which is [Â __Â ] flat get the [Â __Â ] over

4124.319 --> 4128.080000000001
it

4125.279 --> 4128.4800000000005
if you can't handle it then [Â __Â ] die

4128.08 --> 4133.839
just

4128.48 --> 4133.839
[Â __Â ] off and die

4137.92 --> 4143.12
right and i bet there is a vast majority

4141.199 --> 4145.199
of people in the world that cannot

4143.12 --> 4149.12
handle how the world works right now

4145.199 --> 4151.3589999999995
yeah well [Â __Â ] die get the [Â __Â ] out

4149.12 --> 4153.12
your very presence and your stupid

4151.359 --> 4156.159000000001
inability to deal with it

4153.12 --> 4160.64
is making it worse so get the

4156.159 --> 4163.3589999999995
[Â __Â ] out of this [Â __Â ] life

4160.64 --> 4166.0
stop making it worse for everybody with

4163.359 --> 4175.839
your stupid inability to deal with

4166.0 --> 4175.839
[Â __Â ] reality

4196.64 --> 4200.64
what is the largest natural

4201.04 --> 4206.08
there is no perfect natural sphere

4203.84 --> 4208.08
spheres don't really form like that in

4206.08 --> 4210.239
nature on the large scale

4208.08 --> 4212.0
on the small scale yes everything tends

4210.239 --> 4214.0
to become spherical

4212.0 --> 4215.92
i speculate that it has something to do

4214.0 --> 4217.92
with the small forces like surface

4215.92 --> 4219.92
tension they will make things spherical

4217.92 --> 4220.32
so the smaller things get yes everything

4219.92 --> 4223.84
will

4220.32 --> 4226.32
be much more likely to become spherical

4223.84 --> 4227.52
or and eventually crystalline because

4226.32 --> 4229.28
the real nature

4227.52 --> 4233.360000000001
is crystalline it's not necessarily

4229.28 --> 4238.08
spherical crystals are not spherical

4233.36 --> 4241.199
right yep fluids everything that's fluid

4238.08 --> 4243.679
or not liquid will eventually turn

4241.199 --> 4248.08
spherical if it becomes small enough

4243.679 --> 4251.76
right but all big things rocks in nature

4248.08 --> 4253.44
they might resemble something spherical

4251.76 --> 4256.400000000001
at a distance when you look at it it

4253.44 --> 4259.839999999999
might look kind of spherical

4256.4 --> 4261.44
when you look at close up it's anything

4259.84 --> 4264.719
but a perfect sphere

4261.44 --> 4273.839999999999
because perfect spheres in nature

4264.719 --> 4273.84
don't really happen they never do

4274.239 --> 4280.48
only happens in a very small scale

4277.76 --> 4283.04
literally becomes very small objects may

4280.48 --> 4283.36
be more likely to be perfectly spherical

4283.04 --> 4286.96
or

4283.36 --> 4288.639999999999
almost perfectly spherical to theorize

4286.96 --> 4290.2390000000005
that there is no such thing as an

4288.64 --> 4294.2390000000005
absolute perfect sphere

4290.239 --> 4294.239
that's that it might be naturally

4298.84 --> 4301.76
impossible

4300.0 --> 4305.84
i hope that answers the question robin

4301.76 --> 4305.84
stanley i didn't really give an example

4308.48 --> 4312.159
okay what is the largest naturally

4310.32 --> 4313.95
occurring i can't think of it i

4312.159 --> 4317.0599999999995
literally cannot think of it

4313.95 --> 4317.0599999999995
[Music]

4320.96 --> 4326.2390000000005
i yeah i can't think of it nothing

4324.64 --> 4328.400000000001
when i think about it is perfectly

4326.239 --> 4331.12
spherical nothing

4328.4 --> 4332.159
not a thing not nothing that forms

4331.12 --> 4343.84
naturally

4332.159 --> 4343.839999999999
there isn't any

4344.88 --> 4348.08
i'm trying to indulge you but i

4346.32 --> 4351.28
literally cannot think of an

4348.08 --> 4353.199
actual spherical thing in nature that is

4351.28 --> 4354.719
actually perfectly spherical i can't

4353.199 --> 4356.4
think of it

4354.719 --> 4358.719
there's plenty of things close to

4356.4 --> 4360.639999999999
spherical but nothing is actually

4358.719 --> 4363.04
perfectly spherical it doesn't exist in

4360.64 --> 4363.04
nature

4366.32 --> 4371.44
well you know what maybe a buckyball but

4369.52 --> 4372.96
technically a buckyball is like a

4371.44 --> 4376.41
molecule

4372.96 --> 4379.54
so that's so extremely tiny

4376.41 --> 4379.54
[Music]

4380.159 --> 4387.04
fruit oh really so what fruit is

4383.199 --> 4389.199
perfectly spherical i don't know any

4387.04 --> 4390.48
perfectly spherical fruit julio babin

4389.199 --> 4393.36
you know why

4390.48 --> 4394.639999999999
because it always has to be attached to

4393.36 --> 4398.159
the plant

4394.64 --> 4400.159000000001
and thereby that sphere is not perfectly

4398.159 --> 4401.44
spherical because there is a denture

4400.159 --> 4404.96
somewhere or

4401.44 --> 4407.44
an excess in order to provide that

4404.96 --> 4410.719
connection in order to form it

4407.44 --> 4411.599999999999
right so there is no perfect sphere in

4410.719 --> 4415.199
nature

4411.6 --> 4415.1990000000005
not a single thing

4421.28 --> 4427.44
but yeah it's a good example or good

4424.84 --> 4429.6
attempt

4427.44 --> 4432.5599999999995
oh our eyes no our eyes are not

4429.6 --> 4435.360000000001
perfectly spherical

4432.56 --> 4435.360000000001
they're not at all

4437.04 --> 4441.6
did you no eyes are much more like egg

4439.52 --> 4445.1990000000005
shape really

4441.6 --> 4447.6
eyes are deeper than they are

4445.199 --> 4447.599999999999
wide

4449.76 --> 4458.400000000001
a bubble

4455.6 --> 4458.400000000001
that's a good one

4460.159 --> 4463.199
pearls are not perfectly spherical and i

4462.32 --> 4467.28
know because

4463.199 --> 4470.08
i yeah had i dealt with some

4467.28 --> 4470.08
they're imperfect

4470.32 --> 4473.679
bubbles yeah like soap bubbles yeah

4473.28 --> 4477.199
that's

4473.679 --> 4482.56
actually not bad i think that they would

4477.199 --> 4484.48
almost be perfectly spherical

4482.56 --> 4486.080000000001
although is that a naturally occurring

4484.48 --> 4488.639999999999
phenomena where's these

4486.08 --> 4489.92
soap bubbles happening in nature all by

4488.64 --> 4492.159000000001
themselves

4489.92 --> 4495.28
i know there's foam in nature but an

4492.159 --> 4509.879999999999
actual soap bubble

4495.28 --> 4513.009999999999
sounds pretty man-made to me

4509.88 --> 4513.01
[Music]

4514.08 --> 4518.4
right it's kind of funny though that you

4516.4 --> 4520.159
bring this up because way in the past i

4518.4 --> 4520.719
used to reason out everything is a

4520.159 --> 4524.0
sphere

4520.719 --> 4526.96
everything and now that i'm revisiting

4524.0 --> 4529.36
that from a more or less zealot

4526.96 --> 4530.56
perspective i realized that nothing is

4529.36 --> 4533.759999999999
perfectly spherical

4530.56 --> 4534.64
not a singular thing in nature like

4533.76 --> 4537.76
everything is

4534.64 --> 4538.56
sphere there's a lot of things sort of

4537.76 --> 4541.6
spherical

4538.56 --> 4543.1990000000005
almost spherical there is some spherical

4541.6 --> 4548.08
geometrical aspects

4543.199 --> 4548.08
to things but there is no perfect sphere

4548.719 --> 4552.159
yeah robin stanley pearls might be

4550.88 --> 4555.52
interesting but

4552.159 --> 4558.32
literally not pearls are very

4555.52 --> 4560.400000000001
rarely perfectly spherical it's

4558.32 --> 4563.92
extremely rare most pearls

4560.4 --> 4565.04
have yeah you gotta realize how they

4563.92 --> 4567.52
form

4565.04 --> 4570.159
you know it's layer on layer on layer it

4567.52 --> 4572.64
all depends on the offset

4570.159 --> 4574.32
whether the piece of sand that usually

4572.64 --> 4577.4400000000005
is the the

4574.32 --> 4580.32
the start of pearl forming

4577.44 --> 4581.759999999999
it has to somehow be perfectly spherical

4580.32 --> 4584.0
enough for the pearl to

4581.76 --> 4586.0
form itself perfectly spherical around

4584.0 --> 4590.08
it it's extremely rare

4586.0 --> 4590.08
for a pearl to be perfectly spherical

4591.92 --> 4596.0
if it is a naturally created pearl

4594.64 --> 4597.76
because i think that

4596.0 --> 4600.56
pearls are also now being made

4597.76 --> 4600.56
artificially

4606.719 --> 4610.64
what do i need to lighten up about

4608.64 --> 4613.92
jordan elias

4610.64 --> 4623.76
what is this what

4613.92 --> 4626.8
maybe you need to lighten up

4623.76 --> 4626.8
i'm doing just fine

4631.84 --> 4634.96
does eye shape determine long and

4633.84 --> 4640.719
short-sightedness

4634.96 --> 4640.719
no or maybe it does a little

4641.36 --> 4647.199
i know you have to ask an optician i'm

4644.0 --> 4647.199
not an eye doctor

4647.44 --> 4652.96
but probably you're probably onto

4649.679 --> 4652.96
something there to also

4653.28 --> 4657.599999999999
it has to do but most things really have

4655.28 --> 4659.599999999999
to do with the lens

4657.6 --> 4661.1990000000005
and just the ability for the lens to

4659.6 --> 4664.08
focus on

4661.199 --> 4665.839999999999
yeah on the back of the eye so it might

4664.08 --> 4678.159
have some influence

4665.84 --> 4681.84
in general

4678.159 --> 4685.92
right well bubble robin stanley again

4681.84 --> 4688.64
soap bubbles don't happen in nature

4685.92 --> 4690.4800000000005
soap that actually makes bubbles is a

4688.64 --> 4693.04
natural that doesn't

4690.48 --> 4694.799999999999
there is no soap you can find in nature

4693.04 --> 4697.6
it's man-made

4694.8 --> 4700.2390000000005
it's a man-made product from which the

4697.6 --> 4700.2390000000005
bubbles

4704.84 --> 4707.84
arrive

4708.56 --> 4712.4800000000005
let's just say it like this if you were

4710.32 --> 4715.679
to

4712.48 --> 4716.239
come upon some new land that no human

4715.679 --> 4719.6
being has

4716.239 --> 4722.959999999999
ever set foot on ever in history

4719.6 --> 4726.2390000000005
you will never ever bump

4722.96 --> 4729.52
into or find a soap bubble ever

4726.239 --> 4731.599999999999
never it's never going to happen

4729.52 --> 4732.719
because that's not a material that that

4731.6 --> 4735.120000000001
is found in nature

4732.719 --> 4736.159
it will not occur naturally it only

4735.12 --> 4748.88
occurs after

4736.159 --> 4751.199
humans have done something

4748.88 --> 4753.1990000000005
what are you talking about air bubble is

4751.199 --> 4756.879999999999
natural but not perfect spheres

4753.199 --> 4760.0
no what air bubble air doesn't form

4756.88 --> 4763.04
bubbles unless there's some material

4760.0 --> 4766.08
keeping it in

4763.04 --> 4768.0
so unless you know some natural material

4766.08 --> 4771.84
that can actually do that because

4768.0 --> 4774.239
soap is not a nat like the

4771.84 --> 4777.84
the concentrated soap that actually

4774.239 --> 4777.839999999999
forms bubble is not a natural material

4789.76 --> 4794.2390000000005
okay robin stanley i don't know what

4791.679 --> 4794.2390000000005
that means

4794.88 --> 4798.4800000000005
i don't know what you're implying here

4802.159 --> 4807.44
oh and by the way you have to realize

4805.12 --> 4809.199
also that

4807.44 --> 4811.04
when we're talk yeah the earth is not

4809.199 --> 4813.599999999999
even claimed to be a perfect sphere

4811.04 --> 4815.84
it just looks like that on the space

4813.6 --> 4817.360000000001
pictures right

4815.84 --> 4819.84
but it's not even claimed to be a

4817.36 --> 4819.839999999999
perfect sphere

4831.04 --> 4836.639
yeah george sanford well unfortunately

4834.159 --> 4838.96
you're wrong because you know what a

4836.639 --> 4840.719
bubble in water have you ever seen

4838.96 --> 4842.4
a bubble in water have you actually

4840.719 --> 4845.52
studied that

4842.4 --> 4849.199
it's not a perfect sphere

4845.52 --> 4852.320000000001
bubbles actually flatten out

4849.199 --> 4855.678999999999
and spread around like

4852.32 --> 4859.199
like jellyfish shapes they form

4855.679 --> 4860.0
a dome as they go up that's how air

4859.199 --> 4862.159
manifests

4860.0 --> 4864.56
inside water as it goes up it's not a

4862.159 --> 4874.32
perfect sphere

4864.56 --> 4877.92
nothing is

4874.32 --> 4878.799999999999
no air bubbling water is not a perfect

4877.92 --> 4881.6
sphere

4878.8 --> 4881.6
it's not

4885.12 --> 4892.8
yeah well foam bubbles

4888.56 --> 4895.84
guess what you have a foam bubble

4892.8 --> 4896.96
on water guess what what that bottom

4895.84 --> 4900.0
part is

4896.96 --> 4902.719
it's not a dent into the water because

4900.0 --> 4905.12
it's not a perfect sphere

4902.719 --> 4909.12
yeah not a perfect sphere not a perfect

4905.12 --> 4909.12
sphere not a perfect sphere there is

4911.56 --> 4914.7390000000005
[Music]

4914.84 --> 4917.84
none

4930.719 --> 4937.44
well zero g is a concept but

4933.76 --> 4940.8
theoretically yes bubbles

4937.44 --> 4941.759999999999
things in zero g if left there long

4940.8 --> 4944.2390000000005
enough could

4941.76 --> 4945.679
eventually eventually through surface

4944.239 --> 4948.4
tension

4945.679 --> 4950.639
perfect spherical shape that is

4948.4 --> 4953.12
potentially possible but guess what

4950.639 --> 4959.84
zero g artificially created environment

4953.12 --> 4959.84
is not natural

4960.719 --> 4964.8
not perfect you never said perfect okay

4963.04 --> 4967.12
well then anything can be

4964.8 --> 4973.84
anything pick a piece of fruit a bubble

4967.12 --> 4973.84
here and there whatever

4974.4 --> 4976.799999999999
all right

4979.84 --> 4984.32
iron core that's very funny julio pavin

4984.719 --> 4989.679
it's only perfectly spherical if you

4987.04 --> 5001.84
presuppose the earth is a sphere

4989.679 --> 5001.84
around it so it's the same problem

5002.639 --> 5006.8
what is zero g well zero g is the

5005.6 --> 5009.360000000001
conceptual

5006.8 --> 5009.360000000001
it's like the

5010.12 --> 5018.08
heliocentric based physics is oxymoron

5014.239 --> 5019.36
explanation of yeah neutralizing

5018.08 --> 5024.239
relative density

5019.36 --> 5026.839999999999
through through rapid ascend

5024.239 --> 5029.919999999999
uh no decent rapid descent like an

5026.84 --> 5031.84
accelerated descent

5029.92 --> 5032.96
which does not happen naturally it's not

5031.84 --> 5037.4400000000005
a fall

5032.96 --> 5037.44
a fall is not an accelerated descent

5038.96 --> 5044.32
right so zero g is

5042.0 --> 5045.52
the effective neutralization of relative

5044.32 --> 5049.199
density

5045.52 --> 5052.719
by accelerating the entire

5049.199 --> 5054.48
medium the contained medium downwards

5052.719 --> 5056.8
in order to neutralize the relative

5054.48 --> 5060.32
density displacements

5056.8 --> 5063.679
effects no becomes neutralized

5060.32 --> 5066.08
so it's you could call it 0g you could

5063.679 --> 5066.08
call it

5068.96 --> 5074.159
density neutral neutralized density

5075.52 --> 5085.84
yeah why not call it neutralized density

5091.6 --> 5099.84
yes fall is accelerating i know

5095.36 --> 5099.839999999999
but it's not enough

5100.4 --> 5105.44
to neutralize the entire scenario

5103.84 --> 5107.12
because it's still going to be stopped

5105.44 --> 5109.12
it's going to be capped by

5107.12 --> 5110.88
air friction and all that because i'm

5109.12 --> 5113.679
thinking that you're going to do it into

5110.88 --> 5115.1990000000005
a normal air environment right 0g you're

5113.679 --> 5116.88
not going to create a vacuum chamber

5115.199 --> 5118.5599999999995
that can actually

5116.88 --> 5121.76
provide enough room to do that there's

5118.56 --> 5124.56
no vacuum chamber possible of that size

5121.76 --> 5126.719
so you have to push it a little extra in

5124.56 --> 5130.96
order to truly

5126.719 --> 5130.96
create the neutral density scenario

5131.04 --> 5134.56
or zero g if you will

5139.44 --> 5144.0
all right yeah thanks for trying robin

5141.84 --> 5148.2390000000005
stanley i do appreciate it

5144.0 --> 5148.239
it it did make us think at least

5148.56 --> 5159.84
that's cool neutralize density

5155.6 --> 5162.2390000000005
is the replacement word for zero g

5159.84 --> 5164.719
based on a relative density which is

5162.239 --> 5168.159
proven scientific fact

5164.719 --> 5170.4
so it's the effective neutralization of

5168.159 --> 5171.92
relative density disequilibrium

5170.4 --> 5174.32
displacement

5171.92 --> 5175.04
and force the neutralization of it

5174.32 --> 5177.44
through

5175.04 --> 5178.32
acceleration and persistent acceleration

5177.44 --> 5183.839999999999
downward

5178.32 --> 5183.84
of the entire medium

5190.56 --> 5194.320000000001
so acceleration of all densities inside

5193.76 --> 5199.4400000000005
formid

5194.32 --> 5199.44
comet becomes neutralized density yes

5201.6 --> 5207.679
it counterments the natural force

5205.12 --> 5208.48
of relative density this equilibrium in

5207.679 --> 5210.639
all sorts

5208.48 --> 5214.0
it neutralizes it that's why it's

5210.639 --> 5214.0
neutralized density

5214.56 --> 5219.52
it neutralizes the natural tendency of

5217.76 --> 5221.52
density

5219.52 --> 5222.639
to find its equilibrium within the

5221.52 --> 5239.84
medium

5222.639 --> 5239.84
it neutralizes that yeah that's right

5241.6 --> 5244.669000000001
[Music]

5259.44 --> 5263.199
from observer on the ground all

5261.04 --> 5264.8
densities inside format comet accelerate

5263.199 --> 5265.599999999999
downward at the same rate yeah that's

5264.8 --> 5268.719
correct

5265.6 --> 5271.1990000000005
they're being forced to though because

5268.719 --> 5273.84
it is contained like the air inside it

5271.199 --> 5275.44
is contained naturally it would escape

5273.84 --> 5278.88
but there's nowhere to escape

5275.44 --> 5282.239
so it's being forced with

5278.88 --> 5282.639
yeah the separated medium inside to go

5282.239 --> 5295.839999999999
down

5282.639 --> 5295.84
yeah that's right stone monkey 3d

5304.88 --> 5309.84
any natural blue colored food around

5316.8 --> 5321.679
you mean through and through blue

5319.36 --> 5322.719
because there might be some weird frogs

5321.679 --> 5325.04
that might be blue

5322.719 --> 5328.159
i don't recommend eating them by the way

5325.04 --> 5332.159
probably not very healthy

5328.159 --> 5332.5599999999995
but i don't know anything in nature that

5332.159 --> 5337.839999999999
is

5332.56 --> 5341.84
through and through completely blue

5337.84 --> 5343.84
except for certain types of stone

5341.84 --> 5347.1990000000005
blue potatoes well they're actually

5343.84 --> 5347.1990000000005
purple you see

5348.08 --> 5351.28
there's plenty of purple out there

5350.0 --> 5354.56
plenty a lot of

5351.28 --> 5357.04
a lot of purple but actual blue through

5354.56 --> 5359.84
and through

5357.04 --> 5359.84
i don't know any

5360.719 --> 5379.84
blue spiders well are they blue on the

5363.04 --> 5379.84
inside too i highly doubt it

5383.6 --> 5388.639
yeah tell me i wouldn't do that that's

5386.0 --> 5391.6
probably going to result in death

5388.639 --> 5392.2390000000005
like those weird tropical super heavy

5391.6 --> 5395.84
colored

5392.239 --> 5407.199
little frogs are extremely poisonous

5395.84 --> 5410.0
so don't do that

5407.199 --> 5411.28
well matthew eastman who how hard was it

5410.0 --> 5415.12
for me personally to give up the

5411.28 --> 5415.12
heliocenter who says i given it up

5417.6 --> 5424.2390000000005
who says i'm giving it up i'm just not

5420.719 --> 5426.56
trying to reify it into physical reality

5424.239 --> 5428.5599999999995
that's the difference i realized like

5426.56 --> 5430.2390000000005
wait

5428.56 --> 5432.2390000000005
it's not real and then oh the

5430.239 --> 5434.08
disappointment now have to deal with

5432.239 --> 5435.599999999999
what the real reality is and all the

5434.08 --> 5437.04
natural consequences and the

5435.6 --> 5439.04
existentialism and

5437.04 --> 5440.719
like oh my god we're all trapped in

5439.04 --> 5443.44
limited amount of resources blah blah

5440.719 --> 5445.199
blah a super amount of burdens

5443.44 --> 5447.28
that heliocentrists don't want to deal

5445.199 --> 5448.239
with they just want to imagine infinity

5447.28 --> 5450.4
all around and

5448.239 --> 5452.4
infinite opportunity and all that right

5450.4 --> 5454.96
yeah that's the part i had to deal with

5452.4 --> 5455.679
doesn't mean that i'm giving it up

5454.96 --> 5458.719
because

5455.679 --> 5460.719
yeah the model is a lot of fun

5458.719 --> 5463.12
it's a cool concept it's cool to

5460.719 --> 5466.88
fantasize about so who says i'm

5463.12 --> 5469.36
giving it up if you listen to the flat

5466.88 --> 5471.84
earth debate you might be

5469.36 --> 5474.239
taking notice that i'm not giving it up

5471.84 --> 5476.96
that much

5474.239 --> 5478.879999999999
i can still play with it so who says i'm

5476.96 --> 5480.96
giving it up i'm just not trying to

5478.88 --> 5484.32
imagine it to be the physical reality

5480.96 --> 5484.32
anymore that's the big difference

5489.12 --> 5493.36
okay gaining wisdom are you alright

5496.4 --> 5505.839999999999
don't lick the blue colored frogs

5514.4 --> 5517.599999999999
all right stazmaretz yes copper-based

5516.48 --> 5521.04
blood is blue

5517.6 --> 5523.679
like an octopus although

5521.04 --> 5526.4
it oxidizes and then it's not entirely

5523.679 --> 5528.56
blue anymore it becomes purple

5526.4 --> 5529.5199999999995
and besides creatures that have copper

5528.56 --> 5533.1990000000005
blood

5529.52 --> 5536.159000000001
they're never blue on the outside

5533.199 --> 5538.159
have you ever noticed that there's no

5536.159 --> 5538.638999999999
blue creatures that actually have blue

5538.159 --> 5547.839999999999
blood

5538.639 --> 5547.84
on the inside i don't know any

5560.48 --> 5579.199
okay getting wisdom are you alright

5575.52 --> 5579.1990000000005
is this the real gaining wisdom

5580.239 --> 5589.839999999999
what's going on here

5596.8 --> 5603.84
doesn't the real gaining wisdom have a

5598.4 --> 5603.839999999999
wrench let me check

5644.159 --> 5648.719
man i got a lot of people with the

5645.52 --> 5659.84
wrenches and no i don't see it

5648.719 --> 5659.84
that's weird

5660.239 --> 5662.5599999999995
hmm

5670.8 --> 5687.84
okay didn't expect that

5696.48 --> 5699.599999999999
all right well stone monkey 3d are you

5698.56 --> 5704.400000000001
going to insist

5699.6 --> 5707.360000000001
because the model for relative density

5704.4 --> 5709.5199999999995
is complete so you're you you it seems

5707.36 --> 5711.5199999999995
like you're trying

5709.52 --> 5713.119000000001
to find some kind of thing that cannot

5711.52 --> 5714.0
be explained for a relative then see why

5713.119 --> 5717.28
i wish you the best of

5714.0 --> 5720.639
luck because i got a complete model

5717.28 --> 5723.28
that literally explains everything

5720.639 --> 5724.88
everything through relative density i've

5723.28 --> 5728.0
got it all

5724.88 --> 5731.52
the most complete model for that

5728.0 --> 5732.159
to utterly in every conceivable aspect

5731.52 --> 5734.719
replace

5732.159 --> 5735.599999999999
the concept the disproven concept of

5734.719 --> 5738.719
gravity

5735.6 --> 5740.159000000001
i got it all complete so whatever you're

5738.719 --> 5743.44
trying to do it's not gonna help

5740.159 --> 5744.32
because this farce mentioned to act yeah

5743.44 --> 5748.719
it's called

5744.32 --> 5751.84
relative density this equilibrium force

5748.719 --> 5754.96
that is the force

5751.84 --> 5757.28
that is there right that is the force

5754.96 --> 5760.4
that is being countermanded

5757.28 --> 5760.96
by the external acceleration of the

5760.4 --> 5764.48
entire

5760.96 --> 5770.96
object which countermands the relative

5764.48 --> 5773.599999999999
density this equilibrium force

5770.96 --> 5775.28
yeah but i thought that back the helium

5773.6 --> 5776.2390000000005
balloons would shoot back yeah i was

5775.28 --> 5779.5199999999995
wrong

5776.239 --> 5780.5599999999995
i was wrong it was something that i

5779.52 --> 5784.080000000001
thought might happen

5780.56 --> 5786.88
and i was wrong because i didn't size up

5784.08 --> 5788.08
the true scenario of what would happen

5786.88 --> 5791.119
didn't realize that

5788.08 --> 5792.32
the air entire in the inside the entire

5791.119 --> 5795.92
medium inside the

5792.32 --> 5797.119
closed off plane would also be pushed

5795.92 --> 5799.1990000000005
around

5797.119 --> 5801.04
because of the acceleration downward and

5799.199 --> 5805.36
thereby

5801.04 --> 5808.8
well not providing the natural

5805.36 --> 5811.5199999999995
less dense situation

5808.8 --> 5813.1990000000005
for the yeah the denser situation for

5811.52 --> 5816.4800000000005
the helium balloon to escape

5813.199 --> 5819.119
upward so it kind of like

5816.48 --> 5820.08
moves through the acceleration downward

5819.119 --> 5823.119
it the air

5820.08 --> 5824.4
moves more upward it's pushed upward by

5823.119 --> 5828.799999999999
the acceleration

5824.4 --> 5828.799999999999
causing the balloon to effectively be

5829.04 --> 5835.44
in a relatively dense relative density

5832.239 --> 5835.44
neutral scenario

5835.84 --> 5840.719
so yeah that's that's my explanation

5838.84 --> 5843.1990000000005
afterward

5840.719 --> 5846.4800000000005
so all densities falls at the same rate

5843.199 --> 5846.48
no no it doesn't

5847.28 --> 5854.0
falling happens

5850.719 --> 5855.92
in the same pattern acceleration always

5854.0 --> 5860.0
results in the same type of

5855.92 --> 5860.8
build up but the amount depends purely

5860.0 --> 5862.88
on the

5860.8 --> 5865.4400000000005
the differential between the density and

5862.88 --> 5865.4400000000005
the medium

5865.6 --> 5869.280000000001
if the density differential is much

5868.239 --> 5872.959999999999
lower it's much

5869.28 --> 5876.719
closer to the density of the medium then

5872.96 --> 5879.6
it will drifts more slowly

5876.719 --> 5880.8
than if the differential between the

5879.6 --> 5883.84
medium and the object

5880.8 --> 5883.84
is much higher

5890.639 --> 5893.84
no stone monkey 3d the densities do not

5893.199 --> 5897.199
fall

5893.84 --> 5900.400000000001
at the same rate the entire medium

5897.199 --> 5903.44
in the com in the plane is being

5900.4 --> 5907.36
forced it's being pushed

5903.44 --> 5908.159
it's being pushed right because it can't

5907.36 --> 5911.199
escape

5908.159 --> 5914.239
the air inside it just wants to escape

5911.199 --> 5915.678999999999
it can't it's being obstructed by the

5914.239 --> 5918.32
container

5915.679 --> 5920.08
of the plane and it's being pushed all

5918.32 --> 5922.88
of it is being pushed through the

5920.08 --> 5922.88
acceleration

5922.96 --> 5927.04
they don't fall at the same rate nothing

5925.52 --> 5929.6
is falling

5927.04 --> 5929.6
it's just

5931.199 --> 5936.32
density neutralized it's neutralized

5934.8 --> 5938.320000000001
density that's what it is

5936.32 --> 5939.599999999999
the relative density this equilibrium is

5938.32 --> 5941.679
neutral effectively

5939.6 --> 5945.679
neutralized by the introduced

5941.679 --> 5945.679
acceleration of the entire medium

5947.92 --> 5951.52
so what is force pushing on

5949.679 --> 5954.08
free-floating objects

5951.52 --> 5956.96
inside the vomit comet well their

5954.08 --> 5960.0
relative density this equilibrium

5956.96 --> 5962.4800000000005
with their surroundings it's still there

5960.0 --> 5964.719
it's just being there's another force

5962.48 --> 5967.36
another force

5964.719 --> 5968.4800000000005
then the relative density disequilibrium

5967.36 --> 5971.5199999999995
force

5968.48 --> 5974.879999999999
subjected to the entire medium

5971.52 --> 5976.639
causing to effectively

5974.88 --> 5978.719
one force against the other relative

5976.639 --> 5980.56
density disequilibrium force

5978.719 --> 5982.199
against the force of the entire

5980.56 --> 5985.92
accelerating medium

5982.199 --> 5988.799999999999
neutralizing the force

5985.92 --> 5990.0
to which everything inside the medium is

5988.8 --> 5993.28
being subjected

5990.0 --> 5996.32
including the medium itself the air

5993.28 --> 5999.28
which is trapped inside the medium

5996.32 --> 6003.04
right inside the plane so there is the

5999.28 --> 6003.04
forces that are neutralized

6005.52 --> 6008.56
right it's basically the same story as

6008.159 --> 6011.119
oh

6008.56 --> 6012.159000000001
this is why we can prove there is

6011.119 --> 6014.5599999999995
gravity

6012.159 --> 6017.5199999999995
because we can alter we can introduce

6014.56 --> 6018.4800000000005
another force and that proves it has to

6017.52 --> 6021.119000000001
be there

6018.48 --> 6023.119
right no it's just look there is a force

6021.119 --> 6024.799999999999
happening passive displacement relative

6023.119 --> 6026.159
density disequilibrium passive

6024.8 --> 6029.92
displacement force

6026.159 --> 6032.96
actually grounded in proven scientific

6029.92 --> 6034.4
fact versus gravity which is completely

6032.96 --> 6037.6
conceptual

6034.4 --> 6039.92
is not proven scientific fact right

6037.6 --> 6041.4400000000005
so it's the same game it's one force

6039.92 --> 6044.56
against another

6041.44 --> 6046.08
except we don't presuppose some stupid

6044.56 --> 6049.360000000001
unproven gravity

6046.08 --> 6049.679
which makes no damn sense we actually go

6049.36 --> 6052.88
by

6049.679 --> 6056.32
scientific proven

6052.88 --> 6057.119
forces relative density disequilibrium

6056.32 --> 6060.0
force

6057.119 --> 6060.639
that is the force present inside all

6060.0 --> 6062.4
this

6060.639 --> 6064.32
inside of that diving plane that is

6062.4 --> 6065.599999999999
being neutralized by the acceleration of

6064.32 --> 6069.5199999999995
the entire thing

6065.6 --> 6069.52
that is how it works

6073.679 --> 6079.119
so it's the same force game is forces

6076.639 --> 6081.76
being neutralized

6079.119 --> 6083.04
not gravity though because gravity isn't

6081.76 --> 6084.639
even a force

6083.04 --> 6086.4
even though you like to think of it and

6084.639 --> 6088.2390000000005
it's being allowed for you to think of

6086.4 --> 6090.48
it as a force it's not it's not

6088.239 --> 6092.08
anything gravity doesn't exist it's a

6090.48 --> 6096.5599999999995
concept that's completely

6092.08 --> 6100.08
unproven crying out loud that the

6096.56 --> 6102.8
science community is still engaging in

6100.08 --> 6105.28
finding freaking gravity how

6102.8 --> 6107.92
unbelievably [Â __Â ]

6105.28 --> 6109.599999999999
it's literally finding the holy grail

6107.92 --> 6112.719
level of stupid

6109.6 --> 6114.639
finding something that you shouldn't

6112.719 --> 6115.92
have to look for if it was really there

6114.639 --> 6117.92
if it was really there

6115.92 --> 6119.1990000000005
you would find it that's how physics

6117.92 --> 6122.4
work well you have to

6119.199 --> 6125.5199999999995
find the phenomena you literally are

6122.4 --> 6127.04
looking for the phenomenon in the

6125.52 --> 6130.56
experiment for gravity

6127.04 --> 6133.04
can't be more stupid than that

6130.56 --> 6134.0
right well i don't have to look for that

6133.04 --> 6136.32
phenomenon

6134.0 --> 6137.679
of gravity because i got relative

6136.32 --> 6140.159
density

6137.679 --> 6141.28
which we don't have to look for the

6140.159 --> 6143.599999999999
phenomenon

6141.28 --> 6145.36
it's right there it's everywhere and we

6143.6 --> 6146.320000000001
got a formula it's called relative

6145.36 --> 6149.36
density

6146.32 --> 6150.159
it's scientifically provable it is that

6149.36 --> 6153.119
force

6150.159 --> 6154.719
that you like to think is gravity even

6153.119 --> 6157.48
though it's not

6154.719 --> 6159.76
right we got it so we're just

6157.48 --> 6163.839999999999
assimilating the natural

6159.76 --> 6166.159000000001
mechanisms of force other force

6163.84 --> 6168.0
neutral force oh look it's floating yeah

6166.159 --> 6170.4
yeah yeah it's not gravity

6168.0 --> 6172.639
i know you love to call it gravity all

6170.4 --> 6173.36
the gravity all its neutral gravity all

6172.639 --> 6176.400000000001
just like the

6173.36 --> 6178.32
orbits in outer space yeah it's not

6176.4 --> 6179.5199999999995
there is no proof for gravity it's

6178.32 --> 6183.199
actually relative

6179.52 --> 6184.8
density that is being neutralized

6183.199 --> 6187.199
right the relative density this

6184.8 --> 6190.2390000000005
equilibrium force measurable

6187.199 --> 6192.719
provable calculable force

6190.239 --> 6193.919999999999
that is being neutralized by the

6192.719 --> 6196.719
introduction

6193.92 --> 6198.4800000000005
of another acceleration based force due

6196.719 --> 6201.199
to the entire medium

6198.48 --> 6202.4
accelerating right so yeah the forces

6201.199 --> 6205.199
are neutralized

6202.4 --> 6206.799999999999
not gravity though which isn't even a

6205.199 --> 6207.759999999999
force even though you like to think of

6206.8 --> 6210.2390000000005
it as a force

6207.76 --> 6212.0
and it doesn't exist it doesn't actually

6210.239 --> 6213.5199999999995
exist you have no proof for it

6212.0 --> 6215.6
you have no proof that it even is a

6213.52 --> 6216.719
force you just like to think it is a

6215.6 --> 6220.2390000000005
force so

6216.719 --> 6222.88
discard gravity take the actually

6220.239 --> 6225.839999999999
scientifically provable things like

6222.88 --> 6229.04
relative density disequilibrium force

6225.84 --> 6230.639
then insert that into the same mechanism

6229.04 --> 6233.92
and it all works out

6230.639 --> 6233.92
so instead of calling it

6234.88 --> 6241.04
zero g right call it

6238.36 --> 6243.92
neutralized density because that is

6241.04 --> 6246.719
actually what is going on

6243.92 --> 6249.1990000000005
the relation between the densities are

6246.719 --> 6252.0
effectively neutralized

6249.199 --> 6253.119
by introducing another force another

6252.0 --> 6255.199
force because there

6253.119 --> 6256.5599999999995
is a force there its relative density

6255.199 --> 6259.199
this equilibrium force

6256.56 --> 6260.080000000001
and it is being neutralized by the

6259.199 --> 6262.638999999999
introduction

6260.08 --> 6263.6
of another force which is caused by the

6262.639 --> 6268.32
accelerating

6263.6 --> 6268.320000000001
of the entire medium that is what it is

6268.96 --> 6273.52
right you don't think of gravity as a

6271.36 --> 6275.28
force well okay that's fine

6273.52 --> 6277.4400000000005
maybe you don't like to think of it as a

6275.28 --> 6280.48
force a lot of people do though

6277.44 --> 6284.32
but in this case

6280.48 --> 6284.32
there's no need to even bring it up

6286.639 --> 6290.400000000001
what the hell are you talking about link

6288.32 --> 6294.0
to that video what link to

6290.4 --> 6296.48
that video what do you think you can

6294.0 --> 6299.92
sneak in the last 10 minutes

6296.48 --> 6299.919999999999
blue marble science

6300.639 --> 6305.1990000000005
i think you can just sneak in last 10

6302.8 --> 6305.1990000000005
minutes

6305.6 --> 6310.56
have you answered nathan's questions yet

6308.719 --> 6312.0
questions he asked like last time you

6310.56 --> 6313.4400000000005
came in here did you did you answer

6312.0 --> 6317.84
those questions yet

6313.44 --> 6317.839999999999
you know we made a video about it right

6319.199 --> 6331.839999999999
made a video about you again

6339.44 --> 6344.799999999999
balloons in the vomit comment well you

6341.28 --> 6346.8
just have to watch it back

6344.8 --> 6349.92
i got it somewhere but i have to dig it

6346.8 --> 6349.92
out of my skype chat

6350.159 --> 6355.199
all i do know is i

6353.44 --> 6356.879999999999
did not have a full understanding of

6355.199 --> 6359.919999999999
what would transpire

6356.88 --> 6362.08
i tried to imagine what would transpire

6359.92 --> 6364.719
and i was incorrect and then i learned a

6362.08 --> 6364.719
lot from it

6367.119 --> 6372.239
right just goes to show that there is so

6370.719 --> 6375.28
much going on in reality

6372.239 --> 6378.0
it's sometimes hard to keep track of

6375.28 --> 6378.32
but i'm really happy that that video was

6378.0 --> 6382.159
there

6378.32 --> 6384.84
in order to challenge my understanding

6382.159 --> 6386.4
and show me that i was wrong about my

6384.84 --> 6388.8
assumption

6386.4 --> 6389.679
and that i yeah that it just works

6388.8 --> 6393.1990000000005
differently now

6389.679 --> 6395.76
i've re-explained that i've re-engaged

6393.199 --> 6396.48
the entire explanation and basically

6395.76 --> 6399.76
just saying

6396.48 --> 6400.638999999999
okay well yeah i'm just using the

6399.76 --> 6404.0
formulas

6400.639 --> 6407.04
for gravity except i'm routing

6404.0 --> 6408.159
those formulas into actually physically

6407.04 --> 6410.96
proven

6408.159 --> 6412.4
scientific data relative density

6410.96 --> 6415.28
experimental data

6412.4 --> 6417.44
things that you can repeat in order to

6415.28 --> 6418.32
confirm that it actually does work like

6417.44 --> 6421.839999999999
that

6418.32 --> 6425.36
that the formula is correct empirical

6421.84 --> 6426.56
right so i'm just filling in the same

6425.36 --> 6430.32
[Â __Â ]

6426.56 --> 6433.76
right that all you globe lovers and your

6430.32 --> 6436.96
gravity fantasy that they like to use

6433.76 --> 6438.56
it's the same formula except this

6436.96 --> 6441.28
formula

6438.56 --> 6443.280000000001
is not routed into fiction because it's

6441.28 --> 6445.44
based on relative density which is

6443.28 --> 6446.96
actually scientifically proven that's

6445.44 --> 6450.5599999999995
the difference

6446.96 --> 6454.0
so yeah taking your toy

6450.56 --> 6455.52
taking your toy zero g i'm taking it

6454.0 --> 6458.88
away

6455.52 --> 6462.159000000001
it's mine now it's flat earth's

6458.88 --> 6464.159000000001
yeah it's mine it's flat earth it's not

6462.159 --> 6465.839999999999
yours anymore ballers

6464.159 --> 6468.08
it's not yours you don't have proof or

6465.84 --> 6470.0
gravity so you can imagine

6468.08 --> 6472.639
that it's some kind of proof it's not

6470.0 --> 6475.04
though because the entire foundation is

6472.639 --> 6475.679
resting on something that doesn't exist

6475.04 --> 6478.96
and that

6475.679 --> 6482.32
scientific community is still engaging

6478.96 --> 6486.159
and trying to find it's utterly

6482.32 --> 6489.28
ridiculous right so i'm taking your toy

6486.159 --> 6491.839999999999
your zero g fantasy toy

6489.28 --> 6493.199
that you makes you believe there's such

6491.84 --> 6496.2390000000005
a thing as gravity i'm

6493.199 --> 6500.08
taking it from you it's

6496.239 --> 6503.199
mine now it's flat earth's

6500.08 --> 6504.239
the flat earthers own it now own the

6503.199 --> 6507.759999999999
concept

6504.239 --> 6511.5199999999995
and we rub out the zero g

6507.76 --> 6514.88
we put neutralized density

6511.52 --> 6516.639
in its place works exactly the same

6514.88 --> 6520.639
except we don't presuppose something

6516.639 --> 6520.639
that doesn't exist that's the difference

6524.159 --> 6527.759999999999
if you haven't seen one well why don't

6525.76 --> 6530.400000000001
you pay [Â __Â ] attention your goddamn

6527.76 --> 6530.400000000001
[Â __Â ]

6530.8 --> 6535.360000000001
it's in the formula for relative density

6532.8 --> 6535.76
it it's self-explanatory it's right

6535.36 --> 6539.36
there

6535.76 --> 6542.400000000001
relative density the relation density

6539.36 --> 6545.599999999999
relation medium object

6542.4 --> 6547.92
the relation you take one density

6545.6 --> 6549.52
which can be expressed numerically you

6547.92 --> 6554.0
take the other density

6549.52 --> 6556.080000000001
also numerically yeah

6554.0 --> 6558.239
you cross it off you see oh how much

6556.08 --> 6560.88
more dense is this thing

6558.239 --> 6561.5199999999995
than the medium then you got the formula

6560.88 --> 6564.88
that's

6561.52 --> 6565.4400000000005
the formula that is it i'm not going to

6564.88 --> 6568.88
put some

6565.44 --> 6571.119
[Â __Â ] numbers or letters and

6568.88 --> 6572.32
make it into a stupid little [Â __Â ]

6571.119 --> 6575.119
calculation because

6572.32 --> 6575.44
of your mathoholics right we don't give

6575.119 --> 6578.719
a

6575.44 --> 6579.28
[Â __Â ] if it's not mathematical enough for

6578.719 --> 6581.84
you

6579.28 --> 6582.88
it's the script it's a description this

6581.84 --> 6585.92
is how it works

6582.88 --> 6587.92
yeah you can eventually reduce it to a

6585.92 --> 6591.04
mathematical formula

6587.92 --> 6595.4400000000005
but we don't need

6591.04 --> 6598.96
that we don't need the [Â __Â ] math

6595.44 --> 6600.719
to prove we're right we use actual

6598.96 --> 6604.04
experiment

6600.719 --> 6605.199
we use empirical physical repeatable

6604.04 --> 6609.84
experiment

6605.199 --> 6624.96
to prove it not [Â __Â ] math

6609.84 --> 6628.08
over it

6624.96 --> 6631.44
no specific gravity is just

6628.08 --> 6635.199
more stupid gravity assertion

6631.44 --> 6638.4
specific gravity is [Â __Â ]

6635.199 --> 6639.759999999999
it's for specific gravity presupposes

6638.4 --> 6642.0
gravity

6639.76 --> 6644.0
it all presupposes gravity that's why

6642.0 --> 6647.36
gravity is in there it's all

6644.0 --> 6650.719
[Â __Â ] there is no gravity gravity

6647.36 --> 6654.88
is science fiction gravity

6650.719 --> 6654.88
is science fiction

6655.04 --> 6659.679
relative density is the real thing we

6657.52 --> 6661.76
don't give a [Â __Â ] if in the science

6659.679 --> 6664.8
fiction book of gravity

6661.76 --> 6667.1990000000005
they took the actual proven thing

6664.8 --> 6667.84
and then stamped gravity on it to make

6667.199 --> 6670.48
it there

6667.84 --> 6672.2390000000005
supposedly like they invented it oh no

6670.48 --> 6674.239
no just

6672.239 --> 6676.08
flat earthers they just don't like

6674.239 --> 6678.08
gravity they don't like something that

6676.08 --> 6680.5599999999995
you're still engaging in trying to

6678.08 --> 6681.76
[Â __Â ] find out what it goddamn is your

6680.56 --> 6684.56
retards

6681.76 --> 6686.400000000001
no we take the actual proven thing that

6684.56 --> 6687.599
we can demonstrate to ourselves that it

6686.4 --> 6691.119
does work

6687.599 --> 6694.159000000001
and is repeatable we take that

6691.119 --> 6695.839999999999
and then we stick to that we just stick

6694.159 --> 6699.598999999999
to the things we can prove

6695.84 --> 6702.96
you know like in actual science

6699.599 --> 6706.2390000000005
right in actual physics

6702.96 --> 6709.599
we're not going to entertain your stupid

6706.239 --> 6712.0
gravity science fiction [Â __Â ]

6709.599 --> 6713.76
you can stamp gravity on whatever you

6712.0 --> 6717.36
like you can stamp gravity on your

6713.76 --> 6720.0
forehead it doesn't make it real

6717.36 --> 6721.679
you don't even know what gravity is the

6720.0 --> 6724.639
scientific community

6721.679 --> 6726.4
is still trying to find out what the

6724.639 --> 6729.76
[Â __Â ] gravity is your

6726.4 --> 6729.759999999999
goddamn retards

6735.599 --> 6740.56
right so anyway i'm rounding out the

6737.76 --> 6743.76
show it's pretty intense but i like it

6740.56 --> 6745.92
i like doing that so

6743.76 --> 6747.84
thanks everyone for coming i hope you

6745.92 --> 6749.84
liked this show if you did then please

6747.84 --> 6751.679
don't forget to rogan's it up and if you

6749.84 --> 6753.28
haven't already subscribe to my channel

6751.679 --> 6754.719
and hit the bell notification so you

6753.28 --> 6756.96
know when i'm going live

6754.719 --> 6757.92
which is normally 1pm amsterdam time

6756.96 --> 6760.56
every day

6757.92 --> 6761.76
and please also do support me guys and

6760.56 --> 6764.400000000001
gals please

6761.76 --> 6764.96
through the paypal especially patreon

6764.4 --> 6767.36
also

6764.96 --> 6768.96
and the super chat and the membership

6767.36 --> 6771.119
system of course

6768.96 --> 6772.719
that would be really appreciated and can

6771.119 --> 6776.839999999999
still use it

6772.719 --> 6780.2390000000005
you know so please keep it coming

6776.84 --> 6782.400000000001
uh i will be back tomorrow flat earth

6780.239 --> 6784.799999999999
early bird number 786

6782.4 --> 6786.08
on a sunday edition i don't know if

6784.8 --> 6788.719
there's going to be

6786.08 --> 6790.4
a ball buster's live this evening i

6788.719 --> 6793.44
since it was live last

6790.4 --> 6797.36
week i think it's probably not life

6793.44 --> 6797.839999999999
it's no sign that it is live from qe so

6797.36 --> 6801.04
i guess

6797.84 --> 6805.4400000000005
no no live ball busters this evening

6801.04 --> 6810.32
but i will be back tomorrow of course so

6805.44 --> 6812.879999999999
uh right was pretty intense show

6810.32 --> 6814.4
a lot about gravity i might title it

6812.88 --> 6816.8
something like that i'll figure it out

6814.4 --> 6816.799999999999
anyway

6817.199 --> 6820.879999999999
i hope to see you all tomorrow until the

6819.599 --> 6834.1900000000005
next video

6820.88 --> 6854.4400000000005
keep it flat

6834.19 --> 6854.44
[Music]

6873.84 --> 6875.92
you
