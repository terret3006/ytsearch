pretty decent it's no can't really tell

80.83 --> 85.75
if there's some chemtrail e going on or

83.35 --> 89.009
if this is just the side effect of

85.75 --> 94.0
people pretty much lighting fireworks

89.009 --> 96.46
everywhere on a regular basis probably

94.0 --> 101.229
combination of both but it's still

96.46 --> 105.88
really nice and sunny very cold though

101.229 --> 110.789
but it's wind still so got a beautiful

105.88 --> 110.789
lat a beautiful last day of the year I

113.31 --> 121.3

174.87 --> 185.41
Sandra woods yeah yeah good to see you

178.299 --> 187.56900000000002
all so yesterday was quite an

185.41 --> 191.769
interesting day I went over to Jose's

187.569 --> 194.95
again well of course I went over to the

191.769 --> 200.65
Flat Earth debates I don't think I was

194.95 --> 202.32899999999998
super active alright I don't remember so

200.65 --> 204.519
much has happened and I'm still kind of

202.329 --> 206.739
full of everything that happened but

204.519 --> 212.139
anyway the other word just live streams

206.739 --> 222.22
all around including on D live so no

212.139 --> 223.989
Benjamin left a veil I also just noticed

222.22 --> 229.0
that Randy apparently did another thing

223.989 --> 231.56900000000002
an hour before the show I don't know if

229.0 --> 231.569
any of you have

232.129 --> 240.92
Thanks any of you have watched that some

237.959 --> 240.92000000000002
feedback would be nice

253.03 --> 261.04
anyway yeah I had some more moments over

256.15 --> 263.65
at Jose's and I thought it was a pretty

261.04 --> 266.68
good show overall despite all the

263.65 --> 269.10999999999996
typical ballers like at least this time

266.68 --> 273.07
they didn't push it that far like George

269.11 --> 275.94
tried it again but I just like the guy

273.07 --> 281.05
so hollow like this time it just didn't

275.94 --> 291.37
didn't really get to me little demon

281.05 --> 295.86
Goblin it's always trying Yes Mother

291.37 --> 295.86
Salim thank you I thought I did

306.61 --> 315.37
yeah and in a way it is it is what I

310.449 --> 317.379
like about Jose's yeah it is really

315.37 --> 331.06
globe or infested they really do

317.379 --> 334.81
typically their thing and it's ball

331.06 --> 336.699
infested but you know flatters let's get

334.81 --> 340.139
in there too and we get them and we do

336.699 --> 343.659
kind of get a fair shot if we can just

340.139 --> 348.159
yeah out noise the ballers get through

343.659 --> 350.56
and I think that well maybe I my my

348.159 --> 352.15
voice carries through even when

350.56 --> 355.09
everybody's talking through one another

352.15 --> 357.25
I do amp up my tone specifically in a

355.09 --> 361.15
way I get a little closer to the mic so

357.25 --> 364.09
I am technically trying to just over

361.15 --> 366.58
talk everyone this is when I do that I

364.09 --> 377.169
try only to do that when I really think

366.58 --> 379.889
it's necessary no Tom Parker it's you

377.169 --> 379.889
think that's funny

384.86 --> 391.92
yeah Chris is awesome you know it's

389.16 --> 395.28000000000003
weird I really like Chris in a way but

391.92 --> 397.83000000000004
it yeah he has made miss some mistakes

395.28 --> 400.03999999999996
and like he's very excited by the whole

397.83 --> 406.02
thing and that kind of gives him some

400.04 --> 408.15000000000003
minor sivanna tendencies but yeah I

406.02 --> 409.97999999999996
think he knows is probably a bit of an

408.15 --> 413.88
issue and he's working on it is a great

409.98 --> 416.3
guy and he's been just very loyal to

413.88 --> 416.3
Flat Earth

423.58 --> 432.15999999999997
yeah so it's always good to have him on

425.92 --> 446.31
your side in in a flat earth versus

432.16 --> 446.31
globe debate it's a name

459.29 --> 466.1
yeah it's a bit tough to get used to

462.18 --> 466.1
what during live streams

475.05 --> 482.52000000000004
well in regular languages it doesn't

477.569 --> 485.46000000000004
mean anything Tom Parker but if you're

482.52 --> 491.24
going to read it as Lord of the Rings

485.46 --> 491.23999999999995
Elvin then it means friend of the eagle

494.74 --> 504.58
oh yeah by the way I got some grapefruit

500.56 --> 509.55
juice and green tea good stuff

504.58 --> 509.55
especially with bright Sun love it oh

513.66 --> 521.4399999999999
yeah it's also stocked up on plenty of

517.03 --> 526.02
beer including for tomorrow different

521.44 --> 528.6400000000001
types don't get seduced drink you know

526.02 --> 532.66
yeah probably not gonna do that anyway

528.64 --> 535.05
it would be too much so yeah I'm all

532.66 --> 538.3299999999999
ready to go

535.05 --> 544.1099999999999
also I'm planning a little night stream

538.33 --> 546.94
as I did last year for for the new year

544.11 --> 553.63
gonna do it mostly webcam based but I

546.94 --> 555.4000000000001
might even turn on the P 904 recording

553.63 --> 563.5
and then later premiering that or

555.4 --> 568.9599999999999
something we'll see so yeah you can

563.5 --> 573.06
expect what is it in yeah in 10 hours

568.96 --> 575.83
from now roughly I'll be going live

573.06 --> 578.9989999999999
somewhere there

575.83 --> 578.999
[Music]

585.08 --> 594.9200000000001
yet 10 hours from now so that's it's at

589.73 --> 598.15
a ten past two in the afternoon for me

594.92 --> 600.89
now so it will be ten past twelve

598.15 --> 606.38
somewhere in the range between or maybe

600.89 --> 608.51
I'll do the I do the actual moment of

606.38 --> 610.25
the air switch itself in there I don't

608.51 --> 613.75
know we'll see but I will be going live

610.25 --> 613.75
in roughly ten hours from now

615.58 --> 624.74
now of course not on fire ridiculous why

622.22 --> 627.19
do you keep on why do you think that's

624.74 --> 627.19
funny

630.39 --> 635.799
[Music]

637.98 --> 641.179
[Music]

647.59 --> 654.73
all right Omar color sorry if I'm I'm

652.57 --> 657.82
not trying to encourage people to drink

654.73 --> 662.71
it's just that yeah I'm I still drink I

657.82 --> 666.0100000000001
I have still been drinking

662.71 --> 670.27
pretty much yeah every day I in a way it

666.01 --> 673.18
is kind of like okay yeah I have had

670.27 --> 675.5799999999999
longer periods where I've done that but

673.18 --> 678.15
I do feel okay I'm getting 40 now I do

675.58 --> 681.6700000000001
have to be a little bit more careful I

678.15 --> 684.1899999999999
wouldn't need I wouldn't need to take a

681.67 --> 685.75
good opportunity when it arrives and I

684.19 --> 688.5100000000001
feel that I could stop I should probably

685.75 --> 692.08
do that and be a little bit more

688.51 --> 693.58
hesitant to start back up again but yeah

692.08 --> 696.6700000000001
I still enjoy it a lot

693.58 --> 698.7700000000001
and yeah the New Year's has always been

696.67 --> 701.5
an opportunity for me well in the past

698.77 --> 703.99
it would always be champagne I love it

701.5 --> 707.529
champagne during the New Year's but yeah

703.99 --> 709.57
organic it is kind of expensive and I'll

707.529 --> 713.86
just settle for organic beer it's it's

709.57 --> 715.6600000000001
it's good enough I my body is already

713.86 --> 718.53
kind of used to it so it's not gonna

715.66 --> 724.48
have some unexpected shitty side effect

718.53 --> 725.35
or hangover the next day but yeah it's

724.48 --> 729.37
not for everyone

725.35 --> 731.6800000000001
and if you if you're so worried and you

729.37 --> 735.53
need to stay sober then by all means

731.68 --> 738.65
don't be encouraged by what I do

735.53 --> 738.65
[Music]

742.09 --> 750.46
yes fireworks constantly all day long

745.73 --> 755.33
kids kids everywhere ranging from 12 to

750.46 --> 758.33
what 20 roughly and they're just walking

755.33 --> 761.12
around packed warm and just fooling

758.33 --> 764.26
around with yeah this explosive

761.12 --> 766.96
fireworks and many mortars and [ __ ]

764.26 --> 773.35
fooling around all day long everywhere

766.96 --> 773.35
yeah it's tradition

774.52 --> 780.35
it just happens every year all my life

777.77 --> 782.78
this has happened every year I'm used to

780.35 --> 784.58
it I used to it used to be a day where

782.78 --> 787.1
you could never find me inside it'd be

784.58 --> 791.48
freakin outside doing that [ __ ] all day

787.1 --> 794.1800000000001
long and also weirdly enough socializing

791.48 --> 796.76
with a lot of guys it was a great social

794.18 --> 799.4599999999999
opportunity I really feel and I always

796.76 --> 802.52
felt really in my place in my element

799.46 --> 804.86
with screwing around with fireworks and

802.52 --> 807.35
meeting other people that was never

804.86 --> 810.4
really thought about that even for me it

807.35 --> 814.73
was a weird unique social opportunity

810.4 --> 816.98
similar to the angle to things when I

814.73 --> 820.85
went on vacation like it was really

816.98 --> 825.38
doing something specific I had an angle

820.85 --> 828.0400000000001
of approach socially yeah so yeah that's

825.38 --> 828.04
just going on

830.149 --> 836.85
and there's also a lot of annoyed

833.399 --> 839.279
looking people just constantly looking

836.85 --> 841.38
around like ah those damn kids I hope

839.279 --> 845.9399999999999
they're not gonna like throw an

841.38 --> 847.92
explosive right in front of me so yeah

845.94 --> 855.149
that of course is also they're not

847.92 --> 855.93
everybody's happy about fireworks but

855.149 --> 859.77
from us

855.93 --> 861.6899999999999
yeah far as I can see there's no real

859.77 --> 864.3
mam going on it's just fooling on

861.69 --> 867.69
nobody's really seriously trying to get

864.3 --> 870.5999999999999
somebody injured or something they like

867.69 --> 871.74
to like sneakily scare people like it's

870.6 --> 875.49
got a [ __ ] out of them

871.74 --> 878.19
by sneaking up on someone explosive not

875.49 --> 880.5600000000001
too near to them in a way so yeah it's

878.19 --> 883.32
startling people I guess yeah that

880.56 --> 886.52
happens but there's no intent to really

883.32 --> 890.089
physically hurt anyone and that's good

886.52 --> 890.0889999999999
let's keep it that way

899.22 --> 906.6
now Carl : Upton it's no secret as a kid

904.26 --> 913.71
I was crazy with fire words I love that

906.6 --> 916.41
[ __ ] I still kind of do but it's just

913.71 --> 920.88
not a good way to spend my time and

916.41 --> 927.03
money now you know because it does cost

920.88 --> 931.2
money and I don't know completely on my

927.03 --> 933.41
own it's never been that fun you didn't

931.2 --> 938.4300000000001
work much better if I would just be with

933.41 --> 941.6899999999999
with family but yeah maybe in the future

938.43 --> 941.6899999999999
we'll see where it goes

949.889 --> 958.559
ah yeah more color there are some really

954.569 --> 960.889
freaking dumb people I know it's so

958.559 --> 960.889
annoying

968.23 --> 976.82
yeah yeah you know in a way it would be

973.69 --> 978.98
there's already kind of like warnings

976.82 --> 981.44
about fireworks and how not to use them

978.98 --> 983.75
at all but I think especially for

981.44 --> 985.97
parents it would be kind of important

983.75 --> 988.27
that if their kids start to show

985.97 --> 992.77
interest for fireworks at a young age

988.27 --> 995.99
that those parents really make sure that

992.77 --> 998.66
those kids understand how dangerous

995.99 --> 1003.13
fireworks can really be you like get a

998.66 --> 1004.93
feel for it before they just like stop

1003.13 --> 1006.7
paying attention and really get

1004.93 --> 1010.18
themselves in the dangerous position at

1006.7 --> 1013.1800000000001
some point in their life my parents did

1010.18 --> 1018.76
that to me too like one time they had a

1013.18 --> 1022.9599999999999
pretty big bang and yeah they let it go

1018.76 --> 1026.85
off pretty close for my age and I was

1022.96 --> 1029.53
kind of like uncomfortable with it but

1026.85 --> 1030.82
it wasn't like really dangerous that

1029.53 --> 1032.77
they didn't get a headache or anything

1030.82 --> 1035.32
but it was just too close for comfort

1032.77 --> 1040.209
for me at that age I was very interested

1035.32 --> 1042.73
in small banks but yeah just to feel how

1040.209 --> 1044.5600000000002
powerful it really is so that I would

1042.73 --> 1047.38
never underestimate it and yeah that

1044.56 --> 1050.11
helped because ever since that like

1047.38 --> 1053.47
they're really high explosive things I

1050.11 --> 1056.59
kind of I'm fascinated by the large bang

1053.47 --> 1059.32
but I would never like that off in my

1056.59 --> 1064.06
hand really it's because I know what

1059.32 --> 1066.84
what could some someway happen so so I

1064.06 --> 1070.27
usually use secondary ignition methods

1066.84 --> 1072.87
like take a half basic cracker break it

1070.27 --> 1076.45
off put it against the other thing and

1072.87 --> 1077.4399999999998
then use it to light it that way it's

1076.45 --> 1081.16
like very safe

1077.44 --> 1081.16
[Music]

1091.0 --> 1096.44
yeah

1093.23 --> 1096.44
[Music]

1098.69 --> 1106.0990000000002
robbers yeah Voynich burning rubber is

1104.19 --> 1110.69
terrible

1106.099 --> 1110.6899999999998
you know how toxic that [ __ ] is

1115.86 --> 1120.9399999999998
[Music]

1139.47 --> 1145.69
no no really I don't like people that

1142.87 --> 1149.4399999999998
start to light rubber and [ __ ] and all

1145.69 --> 1151.63
that on fire like PVC pipes I get it you

1149.44 --> 1154.18
know I I used to do that too but it's

1151.63 --> 1159.6100000000001
still bad it's not like the smoke is

1154.18 --> 1163.15
really toxic from that [ __ ] just you

1159.61 --> 1164.62
know do it sometimes but yet don't do it

1163.15 --> 1168.52
next to somebody's garden or something

1164.62 --> 1171.1799999999998
that you know it's it's really bad that

1168.52 --> 1171.18
[ __ ] don't

1173.03 --> 1180.299
[Music]

1182.34 --> 1190.1299999999999
[Music]

1184.87 --> 1192.4699999999998
good fine each so don't do that you know

1190.13 --> 1195.2890000000002
and and people don't really do that here

1192.47 --> 1200.45
there's been times that I remember like

1195.289 --> 1202.61
in den hague the hague where yeah why we

1200.45 --> 1204.47
used to often celebrate it with mike

1202.61 --> 1209.4499999999998
with my cousins and everything

1204.47 --> 1211.429
my aunt cool yeah and two families and

1209.45 --> 1213.98
yeah over there it could get pretty

1211.429 --> 1218.96
crazy there were like some weirdos out

1213.98 --> 1221.09
there that would even like yeah first

1218.96 --> 1224.72
off it would be christmas tree burning

1221.09 --> 1226.6399999999999
time specifically and then some people

1224.72 --> 1229.94
would just get so crazy that they just

1226.64 --> 1232.429
drive their old car like over the fire

1229.94 --> 1234.98
and start burning that like that was

1232.429 --> 1237.22
some weird [ __ ] but it was fascinating

1234.98 --> 1240.95
how his head like this post-apocalyptic

1237.22 --> 1243.049
feel to it and it and yeah the police

1240.95 --> 1245.27
didn't take that [ __ ] so when that

1243.049 --> 1247.7
happened eventually the police got there

1245.27 --> 1249.62
and in the fired part but like that [ __ ]

1247.7 --> 1252.529
would typically happen it was crazy

1249.62 --> 1254.75
times it really felt like Anarchy but i

1252.529 --> 1257.69
don't think that happens anymore at

1254.75 --> 1261.2
least it doesn't happen over here even

1257.69 --> 1263.39
though some people think typically what

1261.2 --> 1266.3300000000002
did happen here is that some people just

1263.39 --> 1274.1490000000001
put their own car on fire for insurance

1266.33 --> 1274.149
fraud [ __ ] yeah that's really disgusting

1276.25 --> 1283.58
but other than that no it's just people

1280.58 --> 1289.61
fooling around with basic explosive

1283.58 --> 1292.3999999999999
fireworks yeah yeah the group that I

1289.61 --> 1294.4399999999998
really have the saddest four are mostly

1292.4 --> 1296.48
the animals because yeah for them it

1294.44 --> 1300.8500000000001
really sucks like all of the animals are

1296.48 --> 1307.4
just like ah to war they're all hiding

1300.85 --> 1309.58
most of them and then you've got like

1307.4 --> 1314.72
these flocks of ducks or geese that are

1309.58 --> 1320.4199999999998
high up trying to get away but yeah

1314.72 --> 1323.05
and of course dogs hate this [ __ ] so

1320.42 --> 1325.52
it's not a fun time for the animals

1323.05 --> 1336.3799999999999
that's my habit everybody it has pets

1325.52 --> 1338.18
knows this right yeah ah sorry I got

1336.38 --> 1341.96
distracted from the subject but anyway

1338.18 --> 1346.0700000000002
people would get crazy with fires but I

1341.96 --> 1349.63
am pretty much all for just getting wood

1346.07 --> 1349.6299999999999
fires like

1352.29 --> 1358.83
I think in some in the town where I grew

1356.43 --> 1362.0900000000001
up most of my life people would just do

1358.83 --> 1365.49
that there would be corners in places

1362.09 --> 1367.8
spread out throughout the village pretty

1365.49 --> 1370.89
low relatively large for that village

1367.8 --> 1374.73
and people would just have bonfires

1370.89 --> 1377.46
there and drink and talk and fool around

1374.73 --> 1379.8600000000001
with fireworks and people roaming the

1377.46 --> 1385.2
town and it would be half the night it's

1379.86 --> 1388.32
great it's like the evening and in the

1385.2 --> 1392.13
night especially for like at least two

1388.32 --> 1394.95
hours and that's that's just a lot of

1392.13 --> 1398.0300000000002
fun just have regular fires of just wood

1394.95 --> 1403.93
fires now don't get all ballistic with

1398.03 --> 1407.1299999999999
with chemical stuff rubber and all that

1434.82 --> 1440.76
dog out for a walk walk or barely know

1438.24 --> 1443.94
in the early morning it was quite like

1440.76 --> 1447.0
at least so most people went out with

1443.94 --> 1450.1200000000001
the dogs and everything back then but as

1447.0 --> 1453.45
soon as the 12 hour mark roughly or 10

1450.12 --> 1458.9299999999998

1453.45 --> 1458.93
woken like oh yeah firework die this is

1494.63 --> 1503.2800000000002

1617.14 --> 1620.4
make up light however

1641.07 --> 1647.1989999999998
all the sewer drains around the city are

1644.169 --> 1649.8990000000001
all gonna be tested for structural

1647.199 --> 1651.969
integrity because everybody's throwing

1649.899 --> 1654.5089999999998
like bigger bombs in that [ __ ] because

1651.969 --> 1661.829

1671.459 --> 1683.3490000000002

don't have any fireworks I don't need

1683.349 --> 1693.069
them that I'm gonna waste my time with

1684.969 --> 1696.759
that or my money you know maybe another

1693.069 --> 1699.219
year but yeah I don't have the money for

1696.759 --> 1704.409
that [ __ ] you know and I still have to

1699.219 --> 1706.179
be careful not to get all euphoric and

1704.409 --> 1708.219
spend too much money because it's kiss

1706.179 --> 1711.0690000000002
still have to survive through the first

1708.219 --> 1713.409
month if financially I'm not at a

1711.069 --> 1716.709
perfect position you know I I have had

1713.409 --> 1718.479
some support plenty of support actually

1716.709 --> 1720.999
especially there Christmas know I've

1718.479 --> 1725.199
really appreciated that so it did help

1720.999 --> 1728.289
but that doesn't mean it I know through

1725.199 --> 1731.19
it yet yes I will still be needing some

1728.289 --> 1731.19
support from you guys

1736.1 --> 1742.09
Oh God yeah Iran in Iraq

1748.7 --> 1753.919
yeah that's a lot of sabre-rattling

1751.2 --> 1753.919
going on again

[Music]

1769.88 --> 1775.2
who

1772.059 --> 1775.2
what's that about

1779.35 --> 1788.889
it's somebody trying to matchmake hair

1782.929 --> 1788.8890000000001
this weird I bet it's a troll

1801.41 --> 1808.52
yep North Korea - hey and even two years

1805.67 --> 1813.98
ago I quite literally predicted that

1808.52 --> 1816.26
what happened there would be see more

1813.98 --> 1820.1
hunky dory for a long time and then

1816.26 --> 1825.1299999999999
suddenly go sour for no apparent real

1820.1 --> 1836.57
reason and then something bad can happen

1825.13 --> 1842.99
at some point and I yeah I kind of have

1836.57 --> 1845.51
a a good long look at that event from

1842.99 --> 1847.46
the other side now I've it's always been

1845.51 --> 1852.56
kind of a mystery whether it really

1847.46 --> 1855.29
transpired but if it does then that's

1852.56 --> 1860.81
pretty remarkable if it does exactly as

1855.29 --> 1861.26
I saw it happen but yeah we'll figure it

1860.81 --> 1866.03
out

1861.26 --> 1868.16
it could be just another you know

1866.03 --> 1870.71
sometimes I almost feel it is like a

1868.16 --> 1876.22
wrestling match and like it rivalries

1870.71 --> 1876.22
are just a way to fend off some

1876.91 --> 1882.2
political steam I guess in a way for

1879.77 --> 1884.3
groups to be able to like yeah they're

1882.2 --> 1887.63
the bad guys now something like that and

1884.3 --> 1890.54
just get a bit riled up to release some

1887.63 --> 1892.7900000000002
tension that it may be that kind of set

1890.54 --> 1894.53
up and that most of it is really just

1892.79 --> 1897.17
puppetry and there's really nothing

1894.53 --> 1901.85
going on it's just a theater piece

1897.17 --> 1905.69
playing playing out together I yeah but

1901.85 --> 1909.1899999999998
if something real happens well we will

1905.69 --> 1909.19
know soon enough I think

1912.22 --> 1915.339
[Music]

1915.409 --> 1924.3890000000001
yeah Marceline well problem is is that

1919.08 --> 1926.07
USA has just grown so used to and has

1924.389 --> 1930.389
adapted pretty much all of their

1926.07 --> 1933.9289999999999
strategies to get in other countries

1930.389 --> 1936.869
businesses that's yeah it's a chronic

1933.929 --> 1939.749
problem it's like an addiction it's an

1936.869 --> 1940.639
imperial addiction then they got pretty

1939.749 --> 1948.539
good at it

1940.639 --> 1950.58
but yeah it has to get over it now

1948.539 --> 1952.969
actually and we don't know if they ever

1950.58 --> 1952.9689999999998
will

1959.8 --> 1967.68
ah sir check oh no actually I had I

1964.87 --> 1971.04
didn't come across any Olli bottom

1967.68 --> 1971.04
didn't see them

1989.0 --> 1994.7
a Tom Parker if your comments are

1992.9 --> 1997.3400000000001
getting deleted that means that you are

1994.7 --> 2000.97
using words that are on the nono list

1997.34 --> 2004.1899999999998

2022.37 --> 2027.4399999999998
know maybe that's supposed to be like

2025.33 --> 2031.31
British humor or something

2027.44 --> 2032.48
I don't really appreciate like I don't

2031.31 --> 2034.81
make that kind of joke

2032.48 --> 2037.73
you might have taken some notice to that

2034.81 --> 2042.05
yeah Nathan jokes about everything you

2037.73 --> 2045.6200000000001
know he goes into like a reversed world

2042.05 --> 2047.96
joke mode anyway it's very British you

2045.62 --> 2051.5
see it a lot I kind of go with it a

2047.96 --> 2056.59
little but I'm not gonna be caught

2051.5 --> 2058.73
saying that kind of [ __ ] because

2056.59 --> 2061.179
naturally I don't really think it's that

2058.73 --> 2061.179

2095.04 --> 2099.87
I'm gonna keep on doing that

2096.33 --> 2102.84
throughout the year and I hope that at

2099.87 --> 2107.13
the end of it I'll not be completely

2102.84 --> 2110.8500000000004
alone and everybody will hate me there's

2107.13 --> 2117.96
a chance that that could happen but yeah

2110.85 --> 2120.0299999999997
I I don't know I'm just my patience with

2117.96 --> 2124.83
bad behaviors are just starting to run

2120.03 --> 2127.32
out more and more slowly a layer of

2124.83 --> 2131.1
protection is getting a little bit

2127.32 --> 2139.67
thinner by the day and I do have a thick

2131.1 --> 2139.67
skin but the spirit not so much

2147.07 --> 2159.4900000000002
no Tom Parker you're not being modded

2151.14 --> 2160.6
that's that's just the chat itself what

2159.49 --> 2163.0
about my own behavior

2160.6 --> 2167.08
well I excrete an eyes my own behavior

2163.0 --> 2171.01
constantly and I judge my own

2167.08 --> 2173.86
performance very strictly like and

2171.01 --> 2177.6400000000003
anytime I'd give some kind of outburst

2173.86 --> 2180.13
or raise my voice the reason has to

2177.64 --> 2181.6299999999997
truly be legitimate and if I was

2180.13 --> 2184.3900000000003
mistaken and sometimes that does happen

2181.63 --> 2186.6400000000003
especially here on the earlybird shall

2184.39 --> 2192.7
show concerning the chat then I will

2186.64 --> 2196.66
correct it but usually when it's voiced

2192.7 --> 2201.39
a voice yeah I'm not mistaken Peck very

2196.66 --> 2201.39
carefully my moments

2209.71 --> 2213.4700000000003
no no I don't need to keep my foot on

2242.0 --> 2247.81
way your language dude

2266.55 --> 2273.98
why does QE give me such a dude point

2271.8 --> 2277.3500000000004
that somebody doesn't give a hard time

2273.98 --> 2285.9900000000002

2277.35 --> 2302.0099999999998
up to him no matter what you know so

2285.99 --> 2304.3689999999997
it's not personal with him thanks up

2302.01 --> 2304.369
taffy

2304.55 --> 2319.86
yeah you know septic what they call is

2309.45 --> 2321.39
what he even admitted so yeah I'm not

2319.86 --> 2324.29
gonna be paying a lot of attention to

2321.39 --> 2324.29
Randy this year

2327.26 --> 2337.17
I'm sure he'll it has all kinds of plans

2331.41 --> 2339.7799999999997
to still be somewhat relevant and this

2337.17 --> 2341.609
flat earth way technical way and still

2339.78 --> 2344.07
gained that attention despite all that

2341.609 --> 2348.84
always behavior because basically he

2344.07 --> 2354.06
just wants everyone to accept his bad

2348.84 --> 2358.51
behavior and just bypass it that's what

2354.06 --> 2363.7799999999997
he wants just once his attention

[Music]

2365.96 --> 2375.75
that chemist you mean Adam ikan well QE

2372.75 --> 2377.66
would be an absolute fool to go against

Adam ikan because Adam ikan is

2377.66 --> 2384.42
absolutely his superior when it comes to

2381.119 --> 2388.8900000000003
chemistry in his field and Adam ikan is

2384.42 --> 2394.14
not a it's a very disciplined guy when

2388.89 --> 2399.859
it comes to what he claims so it's very

2394.14 --> 2402.72
careful it's completely stupid to start

2399.859 --> 2405.24
to start so fine hanging on Adam ikan

2402.72 --> 2408.3799999999997

Oh big Chung is mean younger sister the

2425.46 --> 2431.43
faintest the idea of his balls floating

2429.45 --> 2438.24
out there doesn't want to lose his

2431.43 --> 2441.39
marbles I know you'll always have your

2438.24 --> 2443.3089999999997
marbles in your mind nobody can take

2441.39 --> 2445.17
those away from you although you

2443.309 --> 2448.46
probably do better to just let them go

2445.17 --> 2448.46
yourself and move on

2504.089 --> 2512.5789999999997
mmm got some new people in chat here

2507.859 --> 2515.089
doing a cross layer scene a big chunk

2512.579 --> 2515.0890000000004
--is around

2523.299 --> 2533.649
Oh in Adams you did so that you probably

2530.589 --> 2538.599
got to see the the interference pattern

2533.649 --> 2541.019
of the light distribution is that you

2538.599 --> 2544.8990000000003
get to see that the apparent wave

2541.019 --> 2548.979
deviation pattern or that you get to

2544.899 --> 2551.2889999999998
actually see the the alteration of the

2548.979 --> 2556.0789999999997
knowing which path causing the wave

2551.289 --> 2556.079
function collapse which one did you see

2562.26 --> 2569.1600000000003
because I've never seen the ladder it's

2565.71 --> 2571.8
one of my main criticisms about 4qe and

2569.16 --> 2573.06
he kind of does a baller move every time

2571.8 --> 2575.6400000000003
I do that just say that it's out there

2573.06 --> 2577.68
just go there read this what about no no

2575.64 --> 2581.16
why don't you actually show the

2577.68 --> 2583.5899999999997
demonstration that would satisfy me and

2581.16 --> 2585.92
everyone else with it and then he does

2583.59 --> 2585.92
do it

2596.699 --> 2605.219
but what did you see did you see a piece

2601.809 --> 2609.88
of equipment and a laser or whatever a

2605.219 --> 2612.039
readout and then switching back to a guy

2609.88 --> 2614.259
talking about what he was doing and then

2612.039 --> 2616.6890000000003
switching back in another setup where it

2614.259 --> 2622.079
shows different is that what you see it

2616.689 --> 2624.459
and probably think that that type of

2622.079 --> 2626.739
demonstrations are out there that

2624.459 --> 2629.769
doesn't actually prove it though can

2626.739 --> 2632.739
easily be tricked with you have to see

2629.769 --> 2636.3999999999996
it in a non stop shot and then the

2632.739 --> 2640.299
actual independent variable has to be

2636.4 --> 2643.15
manipulated live and then see the

2640.299 --> 2646.42
wavefunction collapse happening on the

2643.15 --> 2649.779
spot and returning back to normal again

2646.42 --> 2653.289
also so you could literally just back

2649.779 --> 2657.269
and forth that on camera and in one live

2653.289 --> 2657.2690000000002

2714.62 --> 2718.88
what you're trying to say there

2716.15 --> 2721.4300000000003
you hate regimes not people problem is

2718.88 --> 2729.5
however that regimes are kind of upheld

2721.43 --> 2733.46
by people so but yeah the entire US

2729.5 --> 2735.98
Empire is a pretty complex setup always

2733.46 --> 2739.4
has been there's been like a double

2735.98 --> 2742.07
edged sword or a two-faced figure

2739.4 --> 2744.89
because on one side the the grassroots

2742.07 --> 2749.81
culture has always been very great logos

2744.89 --> 2752.23
based and yeah the other side was the

2749.81 --> 2756.11
empire of the Federals the dark ones

2752.23 --> 2757.7
that would kind of take rain and the

2756.11 --> 2762.56
grassroots constantly would have to

2757.7 --> 2766.2799999999997
fight that but yeah now in this age

2762.56 --> 2769.2999999999997
there is also the the well the marxist

2766.28 --> 2772.5800000000004

and that really kindness is yeah

2776.81 --> 2783.47
poisoning the milk a bit is taking away

2779.81 --> 2786.11
from the general appeal to count the

2783.47 --> 2789.3199999999997
counterbalance the Imperial side and so

2786.11 --> 2795.26
it's really not good for America and for

2789.32 --> 2798.9500000000003
its image overall cuz it just makes it

2795.26 --> 2803.96
more blatantly two-faced and like

2798.95 --> 2805.79
psychotic anyway the I don't think that

2803.96 --> 2807.82
really appeals to a lot of people out

2805.79 --> 2807.82
there

2815.319 --> 2823.699

3010.66 --> 3023.0
thoughts on the Nephilim the not too

3016.43 --> 3025.2799999999997
much I think that the the physical

3023.0 --> 3027.23
manifestation of all that it really is

3025.28 --> 3030.6400000000003
in the far past and who knows what's

3027.23 --> 3033.53
left of their line what they've become

3030.64 --> 3039.17
if they're still some of it is still

3033.53 --> 3042.5800000000004

oh please you don't know that his

3096.09 --> 3105.3
disciple you don't know that

3099.99 --> 3107.91
at all you do you do realize that actual

3105.3 --> 3110.3700000000003
Muslims like the real one not the

3107.91 --> 3113.58
Pharisees among that or the the

3110.37 --> 3115.5
demon-possessed that it just driven by

3113.58 --> 3116.43
blood hunger and yeah they're there

3115.5 --> 3118.71
they're there

3116.43 --> 3122.04
among them that's it's their form of

3118.71 --> 3125.3
their personal grab lers right and some

3122.04 --> 3128.73
of them are like kind of in control but

3125.3 --> 3133.55
Muslims actually do respect

3128.73 --> 3137.97
Jesus Christ to give him recognition so

3133.55 --> 3140.19
it's just it's just the vision you know

3137.97 --> 3143.3999999999996
they got their Pharisees and that the

3140.19 --> 3152.7200000000003
Christian have theirs it's a challenge

3143.4 --> 3152.7200000000003
for everyone know it wasn't

3155.05 --> 3172.3500000000004
Oh respect doesn't mean anything does it

3168.28 --> 3174.61
really no respect does mean everything

3172.35 --> 3179.94

[Music]

3216.39 --> 3223.66
right religious background well I don't

3221.799 --> 3228.759
really have a religious background my

3223.66 --> 3231.3689999999997
family was pretty liberal and or rather

3228.759 --> 3234.5190000000002
like the liberal conceptualization of

3231.369 --> 3237.309
spiritualism so we would graft in

3234.519 --> 3242.5
whatever caught our interest and reflect

3237.309 --> 3244.98
upon that so yeah I don't come from a

3242.5 --> 3244.98
religious background

3258.65 --> 3266.9
although one could say that yeah through

3265.28 --> 3270.4700000000003
my mother's family through my

3266.9 --> 3273.44
grandmother mostly there were there was

3270.47 --> 3276.5899999999997
like outspoken sympathy for the Jews and

3273.44 --> 3279.92
interest in the Jews and I was

3276.59 --> 3282.59
interested in it still kind of AM but

3279.92 --> 3284.15
it's always been odd it's not outside of

3282.59 --> 3286.76
that part of the family

3284.15 --> 3289.52
from my grandmother specifically she's

3286.76 --> 3293.8700000000003
dead I don't think it's even that like

3289.52 --> 3297.23
yeah nothing's gonna be like it was but

3293.87 --> 3299.63
that was a bit of an influence and from

3297.23 --> 3303.17
my dad's side well that my dad's side

3299.63 --> 3308.9900000000002
was traditionally Catholic and pretty

3303.17 --> 3311.09
serious still it's not like oh yeah

3308.99 --> 3314.0
weird we happen to be Catholic now like

3311.09 --> 3320.1200000000003
kind of church-going Catholics among

3314.0 --> 3323.39
them it's it's become more trivial among

3320.12 --> 3325.19
like half of them I think but so there

3323.39 --> 3327.62
was some Catholic influence through my

3325.19 --> 3331.73
dad even though he was kind of an

3327.62 --> 3335.8399999999997
atheist but at the same time well not

3331.73 --> 3338.09
really kind of hold on to the to just

3335.84 --> 3341.54
the feeling experience of believing in

3338.09 --> 3347.6000000000004
God oh pretty much throughout but he

3341.54 --> 3352.55
acted more like an atheist so yeah

3347.6 --> 3356.33
that's the influence is pretty much now

3352.55 --> 3358.9300000000003
as for what we learned and what

3356.33 --> 3361.31
everybody in the family really

3358.93 --> 3363.8599999999997
sympathized with now that is all over

3361.31 --> 3367.66
the place like in all kinds of

3363.86 --> 3367.6600000000003
directions for different reasons but

3368.92 --> 3373.79
even from my dad's perspective from

3371.87 --> 3377.23
everybody's perspective we all kind of

3373.79 --> 3379.69
like Buddhists in a way

3377.23 --> 3382.36
maybe it was a good common ground for

3379.69 --> 3387.57
people that have all kinds of difference

3382.36 --> 3391.15
of angles to things and other than that

3387.57 --> 3403.42
well I personally went exploring in in

3391.15 --> 3408.27
Wicca and paganism for a time and yeah

3403.42 --> 3412.38
what came out of that eventually yeah I

3408.27 --> 3417.04
earned two Christian I turned to Christ

3412.38 --> 3418.3900000000003
kind of cause I had to I think I don't

3417.04 --> 3420.7799999999997
know what would have happened if I

3418.39 --> 3420.7799999999997
hadn't

3421.91 --> 3431.3089999999997
[Music]

3439.659 --> 3444.949
yeah while Sarita Cosentino you know

3442.88 --> 3448.099
what that's the issue

3444.949 --> 3451.2490000000003
I talked about how the Bible has

3448.099 --> 3454.819
basically been shaped by Jesuits and

3451.249 --> 3457.6989999999996
been integrated into this Gnostic

3454.819 --> 3459.949
approach of Christ the Sun right the

3457.699 --> 3462.619
Gnostic approach that they did that

3459.949 --> 3465.619
right well that certainly did change a

3462.619 --> 3467.15
lot of things about the whole angle to

3465.619 --> 3469.159
Christ and all that and what everybody

3467.15 --> 3473.4790000000003
does right well what makes you think

3469.159 --> 3478.5190000000002
that that didn't happen - to the Quran

3473.479 --> 3485.0589999999997
of course it did from their group they

3478.519 --> 3488.3289999999997
did that they would typically yeah in a

3485.059 --> 3490.909
way like over ikana fie things because

3488.329 --> 3499.13
that is what that religion kind of

3490.909 --> 3501.199
became but do you think how its kind of

3499.13 --> 3504.049
the same situation with Jesus Christ

3501.199 --> 3508.159
himself do you think that what happened

3504.049 --> 3510.949
afterward and they do the Catholic Roman

3508.159 --> 3513.589
Catholic Empire as it were that came out

3510.949 --> 3514.839
of it that he raised that well what

3513.589 --> 3518.119
makes you think that

3514.839 --> 3522.13
Mohammed assuming that he really was

3518.119 --> 3526.219
approached by the creator himself again

3522.13 --> 3529.009
through those angels that he would

3526.219 --> 3533.169
wouldn't see what has come out of this

3529.009 --> 3537.559
the as an abomination really is not

3533.169 --> 3540.229
really true to the original because yeah

3537.559 --> 3545.15
because of things that were probably

3540.229 --> 3548.7189999999996
just made that came out of it that were

3545.15 --> 3550.23
not intended to be their imperial

3548.719 --> 3555.3
ization

3550.23 --> 3557.31
I don't know for sure though they're

3555.3 --> 3559.8300000000004
probably not going to like that don't

3557.31 --> 3562.47
think anyone in that religion will

3559.83 --> 3564.72
appreciate be saying that but I'm really

3562.47 --> 3566.49
just trying to be realistic we are we're

3564.72 --> 3572.3999999999996
always going to be dealing with people

3566.49 --> 3575.22
and and people that really want power

3572.4 --> 3577.14
and all that and really want to bend

3575.22 --> 3580.35
everything to their will they're gonna

3577.14 --> 3582.96
do their best every single time to

3580.35 --> 3585.72
basically use this light of God and put

3582.96 --> 3590.73
some kind of framework around it that to

3585.72 --> 3594.5099999999998
try to tame it the imperial ization and

3590.73 --> 3596.52
it happened to to the to the Bible and I

3594.51 --> 3603.48
think it probably also happened to the

3596.52 --> 3607.28
to the Koran but that doesn't mean that

3603.48 --> 3611.4900000000002
there is no actual legitimacy that see

3607.28 --> 3619.8
who are you to say that Mohammad did not

3611.49 --> 3625.41
actually get approached by God you know

3619.8 --> 3629.07
and also was it kind of where was it

3625.41 --> 3632.1299999999997
stated that the man would be flawless no

3629.07 --> 3636.81
it's not Jesus Christ is different at it

3632.13 --> 3638.55
in that way I think that I don't know it

3636.81 --> 3641.0099999999998
just feels every time I hear about it

3638.55 --> 3647.6400000000003
that the approach of God to Muhammad was

3641.01 --> 3666.119
just for them I don't know I like it's

3647.64 --> 3669.81
tough to explain it yeah all these

3666.119 --> 3670.26
mantras is just it's not really helping

3669.81 --> 3676.02
anyone

3670.26 --> 3681.17
it's just over generalization what my

3676.02 --> 3683.85
superjet what what's what's going on oh

3681.17 --> 3685.9700000000003
you're right yeah Toby I'm sorry I

3683.85 --> 3689.8399999999997
missed that

3685.97 --> 3695.5499999999997
yeah no no why did you have to give me

3689.84 --> 3698.73
666 euros but yeah thanks I guess just

3695.55 --> 3704.69
receiving money from a Glover feel it
