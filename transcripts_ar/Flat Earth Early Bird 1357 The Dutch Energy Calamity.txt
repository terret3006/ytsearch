and

101.119 --> 107.68
direly needed

103.52 --> 107.67999999999999
was already the case but now yeah

108.24 --> 111.439
i'll get to that

111.84 --> 116.07900000000001
the weather

114.72 --> 118.88
is

116.079 --> 118.88
back up

119.119 --> 125.0
back to

120.88 --> 125.0
what it was yesterday kinda

128.319 --> 132.23899999999998
but yeah this night it had actually been

130.959 --> 135.28
raining

132.239 --> 137.04
pretty continually

135.28 --> 138.319
and uh

137.04 --> 141.51999999999998
yeah it's been

138.319 --> 144.64
like even lightning storming

141.52 --> 146.16
this night a lot like and raining pretty

144.64 --> 147.44
hard

146.16 --> 151.04
yeah and

147.44 --> 153.28
i i kind of wanted to film it but

151.04 --> 156.64
just didn't get to it but there was like

153.28 --> 159.599
lightning striking very close by i think

156.64 --> 162.16
probably like in the building

159.599 --> 164.64
behind those trees there

162.16 --> 168.319
because it would be like a super bright

164.64 --> 172.07999999999998
strike and just instant bang

168.319 --> 174.39999999999998
it's very close a couple of times

172.08 --> 176.23000000000002
like close enough for me to get nervous

174.4 --> 179.12
and actually close my door

176.23 --> 181.67999999999998
[Laughter]

179.12 --> 184.56
and sort of like step away from my

181.68 --> 186.8
computer a bit

184.56 --> 189.2
because it was just lightning

186.8 --> 191.28
the lightning was

189.2 --> 194.159
pretty heavy

191.28 --> 196.4
but yeah not right now it seems like

194.159 --> 198.72
there's this new theme going on or this

196.4 --> 200.64000000000001
new system where it's just raining at

198.72 --> 204.08
night

200.64 --> 206.64
and i mean the plants are loving it

204.08 --> 206.64000000000001
but yeah

207.84 --> 213.68
to get this heat back again

211.2 --> 217.599
in the morning

213.68 --> 220.59900000000002
because it's just hot again so

217.599 --> 220.599
anyway

228.799 --> 232.959
oh

230.159 --> 234.07999999999998
hey bjc net yeah first in chat that was

232.959 --> 237.28
quick

234.08 --> 239.68
send a small paypal thank you because

237.28 --> 242.56
i got a problem

239.68 --> 246.15900000000002
like all of us here have a problem

242.56 --> 248.4
yesterday yeah yesterday's show

246.159 --> 252.0
was kind of interesting but it rounded

248.4 --> 252.0
out on just a sour note

252.239 --> 256.23900000000003
with bev getting in there i didn't

254.159 --> 258.4
expect that i banned him at the time i

256.239 --> 259.919
did unban him again including gadget

258.4 --> 261.75899999999996
inspector because

259.919 --> 264.75899999999996
i don't know man it was just terrible

261.759 --> 264.759
timing

269.919 --> 274.08
and later that day i figured out why

281.44 --> 283.84
what

287.759 --> 290.0
uh

290.639 --> 293.52
because yeah

293.68 --> 300.8
our landlord has sent us all letters

298.0 --> 303.44
but oh i have to heighten the price but

300.8 --> 305.28000000000003
it the way he's talking is all kind of

303.44 --> 308.4
weird in the letter

305.28 --> 311.59999999999997
like not from a very confident position

308.4 --> 313.44
but he's like heightening the rent with

311.6 --> 317.68
60 euros

313.44 --> 317.68
which is completely untenable

318.8 --> 325.36
i mean he had already heightened it

322.0 --> 328.479
and anyway thanks for the paypal pjc net

325.36 --> 331.28000000000003
so there was like a huge moral bomb that

328.479 --> 331.28
exploded

332.919 --> 338.4
demoralizing bomb i mean

335.6 --> 340.88
yesterday evening

338.4 --> 342.88
and i guess i sort of felt the

340.88 --> 346.639
weird

342.88 --> 349.36
i felt it in the ether pun intended

346.639 --> 353.84000000000003
on the show before that

349.36 --> 353.84000000000003
right but right now yeah i'm having a

353.919 --> 357.039
contact with my social worker i'm seeing

355.68 --> 359.84000000000003
him tomorrow

357.039 --> 362.15999999999997
to talk about this and like yeah what

359.84 --> 364.88
are we going to do about this

362.16 --> 367.36
because this is just like

364.88 --> 368.4
i mean i was already kind of

367.36 --> 370.72
like

368.4 --> 373.67999999999995
barely holding it together

370.72 --> 377.84000000000003
you guys know you're there all the way

373.68 --> 377.84000000000003
well this time this is even worse and

377.919 --> 380.79999999999995
yeah i'm not really in a good place

379.68 --> 383.52
right now

380.8 --> 386.479
don't really know like

383.52 --> 386.479
where to go with this

387.759 --> 395.16
anyway thanks for the paypal

390.8 --> 395.16
any paypal will help

396.08 --> 401.12
right but anyway at first i gotta figure

398.4 --> 401.12
out just like

401.199 --> 404.72
can he even do that

403.919 --> 406.639
can

404.72 --> 408.72
we

406.639 --> 410.88
me and my roommates can we resist this

408.72 --> 410.88000000000005
and

414.639 --> 419.28000000000003
but it's pretty extreme and

416.88 --> 422.319
yeah i already saw a video yesterday was

419.28 --> 424.08
it yesterday yeah it was yesterday

422.319 --> 426.56
on a dutch site

424.08 --> 427.52
or somebody was kind of already talking

426.56 --> 431.919
about

427.52 --> 434.08
like extreme energy problems

431.919 --> 437.52
i think i even mentioned it myself but

434.08 --> 438.56
yeah yesterday evening it it hit

437.52 --> 439.75899999999996
me

438.56 --> 441.919
literally

439.759 --> 441.91900000000004
so

442.88 --> 446.88
i'm bummed out at the moment

448.479 --> 452.71999999999997
i feel a weird sensation like

452.88 --> 456.88
i'm very hungry but at the same time i

455.84 --> 459.28
like

456.88 --> 461.039
don't feel like eating

459.28 --> 463.35999999999996
but despite that i still have an

461.039 --> 464.639
illuminati croissant in the oven right

463.36 --> 468.24
now

464.639 --> 468.24
i'm gonna need to eat something

468.8 --> 471.199
anyway

475.68 --> 481.639
hey sleeping warrior to see you

505.919 --> 510.0
right so anyway

507.52 --> 512.4789999999999
yeah i'm slightly demoralized because of

510.0 --> 514.88
personal situation i can definitely use

512.479 --> 516.8000000000001
the paypal donations i already want

514.88 --> 518.32
needed it before because i'm kind of on

516.8 --> 521.4399999999999
the edge of broke

518.32 --> 524.9590000000001
right now yeah but with this on top it's

521.44 --> 524.9590000000001
just i'm a little lost

529.279 --> 534.04
we will see what we can make of the show

542.32 --> 548.2
all right anyway

544.48 --> 548.2
how are you doing tony

551.12 --> 554.9590000000001
all right you have one funny little

553.44 --> 558.32
side note

554.959 --> 562.2399999999999
so watching on benjamin from

558.32 --> 563.36
from monday was it

562.24 --> 564.24
ugh

563.36 --> 567.76
yeah

564.24 --> 570.5600000000001
i did not care for his tuesday stream

567.76 --> 573.279
but the monday i'm like in yeah

570.56 --> 575.279
part into it and apparently his very old

573.279 --> 578.72
dog benny

575.279 --> 582.56
made a miraculous recovery

578.72 --> 582.5600000000001
which is just nice to hear

582.8 --> 588.399
uh

584.88 --> 588.399
another day another dollar

588.839 --> 592.8800000000001
what okay tony

602.88 --> 605.8389999999999
uh

606.8 --> 612.7199999999999
okay let's see let's go through

609.92 --> 612.7199999999999
what they're doing

614.8 --> 618.16
oh god

616.0 --> 620.959
yeah

618.16 --> 620.959
i caught that

621.44 --> 626.72
jaron is

623.279 --> 626.72
again doing like this

626.92 --> 632.399
anti-christianity stream

630.16 --> 636.24
so if he's now

632.399 --> 636.24
doing this apparently

636.72 --> 641.279
uh

637.839 --> 641.2790000000001
oh yeah of course qelive

641.68 --> 648.399
did not catch most of that

644.399 --> 648.399
because i was actually watching gym bob

652.88 --> 656.399
gave me a mention and all that loving

654.88 --> 659.519
that

656.399 --> 661.36
i'm really appreciating jim bob recently

659.519 --> 663.279
by the way not recently from the start

661.36 --> 665.6800000000001
pretty much

663.279 --> 665.68
it's just

670.32 --> 675.36
i don't know how far

672.8 --> 677.3599999999999
actually is real but i just get the

675.36 --> 681.839
feeling with gimbap like he's one of the

677.36 --> 681.839
few people that actually really gets me

684.079 --> 688.079
but i think he just has a general talent

686.24 --> 690.0
for that because he he does that with

688.079 --> 692.16
most people

690.0 --> 692.16
so

694.16 --> 697.88
oh okay

705.92 --> 712.0
yeah okay sleeping warrior yay

709.2 --> 715.48
dude i'm not gonna argue against that

712.0 --> 715.48
at this point

716.72 --> 721.6800000000001
yeah

717.519 --> 721.68
they are they are acting like that

722.639 --> 727.12
whether they always intended to become

725.04 --> 731.0
that is another matter but it's what

727.12 --> 731.0
they're doing right now

731.12 --> 736.88
right but yeah what i mean what is that

733.92 --> 739.92
even going to result into

736.88 --> 743.519
because you can't really defeat

739.92 --> 744.56
our energy our momentum our arguments

743.519 --> 746.0
with

744.56 --> 750.079
well

746.0 --> 752.399
blatant misinterpretations and at homes

750.079 --> 754.7199999999999
like without addressing the arguments

752.399 --> 756.0
right if it's just going to be format

754.72 --> 758.88
fallacies

756.0 --> 761.839
in that direction and complaining about

758.88 --> 764.079
being muted or the way that we do things

761.839 --> 766.0
instead of addressing any of the actual

764.079 --> 768.2399999999999
arguments that were made

766.0 --> 768.24
yeah

768.959 --> 773.56
i think that's only gonna hurt them

774.399 --> 778.16
i mean yes there might still be they

776.8 --> 780.959
might have a

778.16 --> 784.0
very large following

780.959 --> 786.6389999999999
but those people

784.0 --> 788.92
are people too

786.639 --> 791.36
and they're not just going to turn into

788.92 --> 793.76
sjws because

791.36 --> 795.92
the globe buster's team is suddenly out

793.76 --> 798.16
for some group

795.92 --> 800.3199999999999
i mean aren't they out there to actually

798.16 --> 802.639
figure out reality

800.32 --> 806.72
are is globe busters the only show that

802.639 --> 806.72
they watch i highly doubt that

808.32 --> 812.0
especially

809.839 --> 814.8800000000001
since bob has always been talking about

812.0 --> 816.8
flat earth debates about it yeah in this

814.88 --> 818.56
way there's gonna be people over at

816.8 --> 821.199
globe busters that's been following that

818.56 --> 822.56
forever that are just very going along

821.199 --> 825.279
in their attitude

822.56 --> 826.959
that will have checked out the flat

825.279 --> 827.76
earth debates

826.959 --> 830.0
and

827.76 --> 833.36
what yeah especially things like that

830.0 --> 836.24
the whole show with wits it

833.36 --> 838.16
that took so freaking long right so

836.24 --> 840.5600000000001
they're just going to find out what is

838.16 --> 842.399
going on and that's

840.56 --> 845.76
gonna detract from

842.399 --> 846.56
the respect for globe busters

845.76 --> 850.16
so

846.56 --> 850.16
i'm not too worried about that

851.44 --> 858.639
although it is just annoying

856.0 --> 858.639
give you that

859.36 --> 862.5600000000001
all right because it's not the first

860.72 --> 865.12
thing it's basically this has just been

862.56 --> 868.6389999999999
happening for

865.12 --> 871.839
for half a decade now so

868.639 --> 873.519
you know i mean just because five years

871.839 --> 875.36
or something have passed doesn't mean

873.519 --> 878.0
that it's subtly going to stop on the

875.36 --> 878.0
contrary

881.76 --> 884.76
right

890.639 --> 896.16
so yeah just just to make a reference

892.959 --> 896.16
again in comparison

896.56 --> 900.56
to bev try thinking who popped by

898.88 --> 902.16
yesterday abandoned him and then i

900.56 --> 903.8389999999999
unbanned him afterward because i just

902.16 --> 906.0
wanted him to shut up in that moment he

903.839 --> 910.0790000000001
was just escalating

906.0 --> 912.72
things for me included like my mood when

910.079 --> 914.6389999999999
i i was already not

912.72 --> 917.279
feeling great

914.639 --> 920.0790000000001
just that foreshadowing i explained well

917.279 --> 922.56
what happened later

920.079 --> 924.8389999999999
so i just had to like i just had to like

922.56 --> 928.079
mute them

924.839 --> 929.839
right and as i said i was talking

928.079 --> 933.12
negatively

929.839 --> 937.0400000000001
about bev and his show in his kind of

933.12 --> 940.5600000000001
kooky opinions in certain regions

937.04 --> 942.16
more as a defensive measure i mean

940.56 --> 946.079
i'd rather watch

942.16 --> 948.399
try thinking than glowbusters

946.079 --> 950.88
that doesn't say much because i really

948.399 --> 953.6
don't want to watch either

950.88 --> 956.079
but it's not like oh try thinking is the

953.6 --> 959.279
worst show ever and he's just a

956.079 --> 959.279
chill no he's just

961.68 --> 966.7199999999999
he's like the garage band

964.639 --> 969.6800000000001
of flat earth

966.72 --> 971.9200000000001
it's a very rough analogy that's what it

969.68 --> 974.88
feels like to me

971.92 --> 977.12
and that yeah i mean

974.88 --> 978.32
amazing songs can come out of garage

977.12 --> 980.48
bands

978.32 --> 981.36
most of them is just kind of trashy

980.48 --> 982.88
though

981.36 --> 984.8000000000001
so

982.88 --> 986.639
you know just because you're in a garage

984.8 --> 988.7199999999999
band doesn't automatically make you good

986.639 --> 990.399
but if you happen to be really good and

988.72 --> 992.639
you're doing a garage band then

990.399 --> 993.759
interesting things may happen

992.639 --> 997.6
right

993.759 --> 1000.72
don't know if that is the case with bev

997.6 --> 1003.12
but that's just kind of the way i see it

1000.72 --> 1003.12
anyway

1007.199 --> 1012.56
not a lot of what he says i actually

1009.519 --> 1014.16
right it's not really a good

1012.56 --> 1017.3599999999999
like oh

1014.16 --> 1020.36
he talks slightly less [ __ ]

1017.36 --> 1020.36
yes

1031.439 --> 1034.24
i'm gonna yeah

1032.959 --> 1036.24
i'm gonna go there i'm gonna make a

1034.24 --> 1037.679
little joke it's at least when i'm

1036.24 --> 1038.799
watching

1037.679 --> 1040.799
bev

1038.799 --> 1043.9189999999999
not that i have a lot

1040.799 --> 1046.72
at least i don't get the feeling

1043.919 --> 1049.039
like the guys on the panel are secretly

1046.72 --> 1052.039
like watching porn in the background or

1049.039 --> 1052.039
something

1053.52 --> 1058.32
because

1055.2 --> 1060.64
i just get this really gross gross

1058.32 --> 1062.48
feeling a lot of the times when i turn

1060.64 --> 1065.5200000000002
on ball buses just because of the way

1062.48 --> 1068.559
they talk it's just there's something so

1065.52 --> 1068.559
[ __ ] wrong there

1070.64 --> 1073.8400000000001
and

1071.76 --> 1075.919
yeah you might pick up on it you might

1073.84 --> 1077.76
not pick up on it it is a real more like

1075.919 --> 1079.5200000000002
a gut feeling it's really like a

1077.76 --> 1082.08
spiritual thing so it's not something

1079.52 --> 1084.799
like oh that's just the way they use

1082.08 --> 1087.12
their voice no no it's just this weird

1084.799 --> 1091.12
creepy feeling i get

1087.12 --> 1094.12
or not creepy gross just gross

1091.12 --> 1094.12
anyway

1096.24 --> 1100.0
it might also have to do with all of

1098.08 --> 1102.1599999999999
them just letting each other get away

1100.0 --> 1104.559
with saying incredibly stupid things

1102.16 --> 1106.96
that they should all know better about

1104.559 --> 1106.96
anyway

1107.36 --> 1110.559
hey yeah tony

1126.64 --> 1130.24
right yeah but tony look

1131.52 --> 1137.28
it's not really fair to complain he

1134.08 --> 1139.6
doesn't he has zero experiment

1137.28 --> 1141.6
when he technically when it comes down

1139.6 --> 1143.52
to it and push comes to shove he can't

1141.6 --> 1145.36
even define what an experiment or

1143.52 --> 1146.24
science is really

1145.36 --> 1147.76
i mean

1146.24 --> 1150.72
he will do it

1147.76 --> 1152.96
right in just a general remark and then

1150.72 --> 1154.64
immediately backtrack and just say but

1152.96 --> 1155.44
oh but

1154.64 --> 1158.0
yeah

1155.44 --> 1160.559
you don't really have to just like

1158.0 --> 1161.84
heliocentric enthusiasts

1160.559 --> 1164.3999999999999
like the guy

1161.84 --> 1168.32
me and jim bob went up against

1164.4 --> 1168.3200000000002
on jim bob's show two days ago

1173.2 --> 1180.24
right bob does that she's like oh yeah i

1176.48 --> 1181.28
get the scientific method independent

1180.24 --> 1183.52
but

1181.28 --> 1185.44
like 10 minutes later you'll just forget

1183.52 --> 1189.12
he even said that and then just

1185.44 --> 1189.1200000000001
completely redefine it again

1190.32 --> 1193.6789999999999
right

1191.36 --> 1195.28
so how can you expect somebody to have

1193.679 --> 1198.24
experimental

1195.28 --> 1200.559
support for a claim when he's not even

1198.24 --> 1204.08
consistent with what

1200.559 --> 1204.08
an experiment even is

1204.64 --> 1209.2
i know tony

1206.64 --> 1212.159
i mean i know i've known bob for like

1209.2 --> 1212.159
five years now

1213.84 --> 1218.559
i used to watch a lot more of him than i

1216.0 --> 1220.96
do now but even like three years ago he

1218.559 --> 1222.799
would already do this [ __ ] he did this

1220.96 --> 1224.72
exactly the formula of what i just

1222.799 --> 1227.12
described he already was doing that even

1224.72 --> 1230.08
with this incoherent dielectric

1227.12 --> 1232.2399999999998
acceleration did exactly that [ __ ]

1230.08 --> 1234.32
just one definition

1232.24 --> 1235.84
that's correct yeah and then just uh

1234.32 --> 1238.32
shove it to the side right in the

1235.84 --> 1241.1999999999998
garbage and completely re-roll it out a

1238.32 --> 1242.6399999999999
different way and now it is

1241.2 --> 1244.799
that is what it is

1242.64 --> 1244.7990000000002
it's

1246.84 --> 1252.1589999999999
just i think the whole procedure really

1249.6 --> 1254.3999999999999
falls just under gas lighting if you ask

1252.159 --> 1254.4
me

1254.48 --> 1260.08
oh yeah i get it

1257.28 --> 1260.8799999999999
oh oh so you get it yeah i get it

1260.08 --> 1262.72
but

1260.88 --> 1265.2
this is actually what i believe and

1262.72 --> 1267.84
think and how i act which is completely

1265.2 --> 1270.32
different from what i just said

1267.84 --> 1270.32
okay

1271.039 --> 1274.799
all right

1273.28 --> 1276.8799999999999
anyway

1274.799 --> 1279.679
i guess you're since you allowed

1276.88 --> 1281.679
yourself to absorb hours of that [ __ ]

1279.679 --> 1283.919
again i mean i can't even watch

1281.679 --> 1286.72
glowbusters longer than five minutes

1283.919 --> 1288.96
before i just have to turn it on off

1286.72 --> 1292.32
just cannot do it

1288.96 --> 1292.32
it makes me physically ill

1292.799 --> 1298.1589999999999
you of course is being tony i know that

1295.679 --> 1299.76
you probably watched like half or the

1298.159 --> 1301.6000000000001
entire show

1299.76 --> 1303.52
so now you're gonna be completely

1301.6 --> 1306.1589999999999
obsessed with it because that's what

1303.52 --> 1309.679
always happens with you tony after you

1306.159 --> 1311.5200000000002
just watch something like that

1309.679 --> 1313.2
because you always watch more than you

1311.52 --> 1316.32
should

1313.2 --> 1318.96
because of your curiosity

1316.32 --> 1320.559
that's fine

1318.96 --> 1322.88
everybody has their own way of doing

1320.559 --> 1322.8799999999999
things

1324.17 --> 1327.219
[Music]

1343.039 --> 1350.039
are you watching all jesus tony what are

1346.24 --> 1350.039
you doing to yourself

1365.2 --> 1370.0
i wonder sometimes tony like i wonder

1367.76 --> 1373.039
sometimes if you actually have more

1370.0 --> 1375.12
stamina than jim bob

1373.039 --> 1378.48
i mean i'm pretty sure jim bob would not

1375.12 --> 1378.4799999999998
watch that entire show

1387.44 --> 1390.96
okay professor phil bell good luck with

1389.6 --> 1394.08
that

1390.96 --> 1394.08
that's super cute

1401.44 --> 1403.8400000000001
all right

1404.64 --> 1408.96
anyway i'm going to get my illuminati

1406.32 --> 1409.76
kill song getting a bit hungry

1408.96 --> 1411.76
or

1409.76 --> 1413.36
actually less hungry but also less

1411.76 --> 1418.039
nauseated

1413.36 --> 1418.039
i gotta eat something like back

1444.0 --> 1447.0
here

1467.12 --> 1474.6
a fully intact illuminati croissant

1471.279 --> 1474.6
what a treat

1486.72 --> 1489.84
where is everybody

1494.48 --> 1497.3600000000001
this is weird

1497.52 --> 1503.6
did everybody just leave

1500.72 --> 1504.559
yesterday in protest of the way i treat

1503.6 --> 1506.8799999999999
it

1504.559 --> 1506.8799999999999
bev

1513.12 --> 1516.6399999999999
that would be weird

1514.559 --> 1518.72
because my subscribers do seem to be

1516.64 --> 1520.7990000000002
like very much

1518.72 --> 1522.96
growing

1520.799 --> 1524.559
so

1522.96 --> 1527.039
how did i treat beth yeah it was

1524.559 --> 1530.559
yesterday's show at the end

1527.039 --> 1534.8799999999999
i was just not having a good mood

1530.559 --> 1537.76
and basically just character criticizing

1534.88 --> 1541.1200000000001
i always try to just be honest

1537.76 --> 1543.279
our croissants expensive

1541.12 --> 1546.2399999999998
everything is expensive here now

1543.279 --> 1546.24
professor fill bell

1550.96 --> 1556.52
all right but i think it's decently cost

1553.52 --> 1556.52
efficient

1569.76 --> 1574.96
right but anyway yeah about bev again i

1572.24 --> 1577.039
addressed this immediately at the start

1574.96 --> 1580.32
of the show i was just in a really

1577.039 --> 1580.32
terrible mood and

1581.2 --> 1586.24
trolls were there and they were just

1583.12 --> 1586.2399999999998
like nagging me

1587.2 --> 1592.159
and then bev got in there and basically

1589.6 --> 1593.6789999999999
just kind of tried to take over the show

1592.159 --> 1596.5590000000002
from chat

1593.679 --> 1599.279
in the bev style it's just like oh i can

1596.559 --> 1600.72
just do that so then eventually i kicked

1599.279 --> 1603.279
him out

1600.72 --> 1604.799
because i just addressed him

1603.279 --> 1607.36
on well my

1604.799 --> 1609.6
universal philosophical criticism that i

1607.36 --> 1611.039
have on him since the start he'd never

1609.6 --> 1613.6789999999999
let it go

1611.039 --> 1616.96
black swan denier

1613.679 --> 1618.48
he thinks that ego doesn't exist or he

1616.96 --> 1621.2
doesn't have it or something the most

1618.48 --> 1622.72
ridiculous little ego gravel that i've

1621.2 --> 1624.48
ever seen

1622.72 --> 1626.88
is not the first time by the way yeah

1624.48 --> 1629.679
you're not the only person i've ever met

1626.88 --> 1631.44
that actually did that that had a huge

1629.679 --> 1633.76
ego

1631.44 --> 1635.919
fully dedicated in trying to gaslight

1633.76 --> 1638.84
everybody like he doesn't have an ego

1635.919 --> 1641.3600000000001
yeah yeah that that's literally the

1638.84 --> 1644.32
devil trying to convince you he doesn't

1641.36 --> 1646.7199999999998
exist i mean cannot get a more literal

1644.32 --> 1649.279
example of that behavior

1646.72 --> 1652.84
than over at bev's

1649.279 --> 1656.559
yesterday show flat earth early bird

1652.84 --> 1656.559
1356. no title

1657.36 --> 1662.24
right so that sort of thing i addressed

1659.76 --> 1665.36
it and i basically said at the end like

1662.24 --> 1667.1200000000001
yeah just [ __ ] off and like if if you

1665.36 --> 1669.12
really don't

1667.12 --> 1670.8799999999999
like if you like love bev so much why

1669.12 --> 1672.9599999999998
don't you just unsubscribe from me and

1670.88 --> 1674.88
just go watch bev's channel that that's

1672.96 --> 1676.799
kind of how it ended not a great way to

1674.88 --> 1678.7990000000002
end your show

1676.799 --> 1681.799
but there was just something foul in the

1678.799 --> 1681.799
air

1683.919 --> 1689.679
that turned into a huge bill later

1687.279 --> 1691.039
with a massive demoralizing impact on

1689.679 --> 1693.6000000000001
everybody here

1691.039 --> 1694.48
so i probably got like the early win of

1693.6 --> 1696.399
that

1694.48 --> 1699.679
at the end of my show

1696.399 --> 1701.279
because i didn't know it yet back then

1699.679 --> 1704.3200000000002
just felt something

1701.279 --> 1705.279
but uh yeah i don't know

1704.32 --> 1706.799
again

1705.279 --> 1708.799
already addressed this i don't think

1706.799 --> 1711.12
that bev show is the worst

1708.799 --> 1713.279
out there especially compared to globe

1711.12 --> 1715.36
busters i mean i could probably listen

1713.279 --> 1717.679
to bev

1715.36 --> 1720.0
cannot listen to glow busters more than

1717.679 --> 1723.039
five minutes i just cannot do it anymore

1720.0 --> 1723.039
i kind of do it

1723.6 --> 1725.84
so

1728.64 --> 1731.76
30 people watching that chat yeah i

1730.88 --> 1735.159
guess

1731.76 --> 1735.1589999999999
i guess so

1739.52 --> 1744.08
or maybe a whole bunch of people just

1741.919 --> 1746.88
like me had some kind of a terrible

1744.08 --> 1748.799
terrible bill yesterday

1746.88 --> 1751.3600000000001
so they're all just like

1748.799 --> 1756.2
too distracted to like

1751.36 --> 1756.1999999999998
join my show i don't know what it is

1766.159 --> 1771.8400000000001
and definitely not a flat earther what

1769.84 --> 1773.6
what are you talking about level bastard

1771.84 --> 1776.6399999999999
oh you mean he

1773.6 --> 1778.8799999999999
insists on not calling it a flat earther

1776.64 --> 1781.1200000000001
because of ridiculous outdated kooky

1778.88 --> 1784.3200000000002
reasons yes

1781.12 --> 1784.32
yes level bastard

1784.559 --> 1789.12
you lurk a lot okay dank that's fine

1791.12 --> 1795.84
let earth is ridiculous

1793.36 --> 1795.84
no

1797.039 --> 1800.399
what's ridiculous about it

1802.559 --> 1809.1589999999999
it's ridiculous as club earth

1805.679 --> 1809.159
no it's not

1813.76 --> 1818.48
to be more precise if anything the globe

1816.799 --> 1820.84
earth model

1818.48 --> 1824.559
is directly

1820.84 --> 1826.6399999999999
lifted and reconstructed based on top of

1824.559 --> 1829.44
the flat earth model

1826.64 --> 1831.8400000000001
the disc model that i do not agree to by

1829.44 --> 1831.8400000000001
the way

1832.48 --> 1838.3990000000001
so you cannot compare them

1836.08 --> 1840.24
except for both being part of a false

1838.399 --> 1842.8799999999999
dichotomy that everybody likes to trap

1840.24 --> 1842.88
everybody in

1848.399 --> 1852.799
i think he means yeah but that's just

1850.32 --> 1854.6399999999999
[ __ ] straw man tony i mean i'm not

1852.799 --> 1857.519
even gonna address that

1854.64 --> 1860.3200000000002
that's just the kooky [ __ ] arguments

1857.519 --> 1862.72
that bev likes to say it's just a bunch

1860.32 --> 1865.279
of blabber nonsense

1862.72 --> 1868.159
i know it is not flat oh really

1865.279 --> 1870.159
so what is the geometric orientation of

1868.159 --> 1871.1200000000001
the earth's surface within euclidean

1870.159 --> 1872.7990000000002
space

1871.12 --> 1875.5189999999998
level bastard

1872.799 --> 1875.519
you tell me

1875.84 --> 1879.9189999999999
yeah

1877.039 --> 1885.12
describe the number one aspect of the

1879.919 --> 1885.1200000000001
geo the geometry of the earth's surface

1886.559 --> 1890.84
yeah not the shape not the really f

1890.0 --> 1894.559
the

1890.84 --> 1894.559
geometry of the whole

1894.64 --> 1899.6000000000001
how do you describe that that geometric

1897.84 --> 1901.039
aspect

1899.6 --> 1904.519
of the earth's surface how do you

1901.039 --> 1904.519
describe that

1912.0 --> 1918.6
flat has many no

1914.32 --> 1918.6
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

1920.799 --> 1926.0
flat has orientations

1924.48 --> 1929.6
seem to be uh

1926.0 --> 1933.32
linguistically disconnected there

1929.6 --> 1933.32
that makes no sense

1935.84 --> 1939.36
no

1936.72 --> 1939.3600000000001
no it doesn't

1940.559 --> 1945.12
besides what the [ __ ] does the [ __ ]

1942.88 --> 1947.1200000000001
orientation of the earth's surface even

1945.12 --> 1949.4399999999998
matter

1947.12 --> 1951.12
it's flat it doesn't matter how you look

1949.44 --> 1953.2
at it whether you think everything is

1951.12 --> 1955.76
upside down

1953.2 --> 1958.3990000000001
everything like the flat earth is up it

1955.76 --> 1960.48
doesn't [ __ ] matter

1958.399 --> 1963.9189999999999
that doesn't take away from that it is

1960.48 --> 1966.559
technically geometrically flat

1963.919 --> 1969.679
it doesn't [ __ ] matter

1966.559 --> 1972.08
but you could even a wall is flat who

1969.679 --> 1975.5590000000002
gives a [ __ ]

1972.08 --> 1975.559
doesn't matter

1976.559 --> 1980.24
it's flat that's a fact

1984.799 --> 1989.12
band gadget inspector which i can ban

1987.519 --> 1991.519
you if that is literally how you're

1989.12 --> 1993.9189999999999
going to re-enter after i unbanned you

1991.519 --> 1997.279
gadget inspector

1993.919 --> 1997.279
i can't just ban you

1997.6 --> 2001.12
if you're going to insist

2001.919 --> 2005.039
it's up to you

2003.44 --> 2009.88
and i don't have a

2005.039 --> 2009.8799999999999
big threshold at this point to do that

2020.88 --> 2023.88
so

2051.119 --> 2057.96
next time just test with

2053.599 --> 2057.96
the thing that you wanted to say

2086.839 --> 2090.919
so ugh

2110.56 --> 2113.56
what

2119.2 --> 2125.4399999999996
are you talking about me right back

2122.0 --> 2127.76
the professor in the movie water boy

2125.44 --> 2127.76
what

2127.839 --> 2133.0
is that character supposed to be

2129.28 --> 2133.0
resembling me

2145.359 --> 2151.7599999999998
something flat no but now you're just

2147.68 --> 2154.56
using it as a general description

2151.76 --> 2158.2000000000003
that's why i specifically invoke the

2154.56 --> 2158.2
word geometry

2159.44 --> 2166.7200000000003
and then proceeded to say

2162.8 --> 2169.6800000000003
it doesn't matter how that flat is

2166.72 --> 2172.0
orientated if it's all flat it doesn't

2169.68 --> 2174.3199999999997
matter if we're upside down from some

2172.0 --> 2176.96
perspective it doesn't [ __ ] matter

2174.32 --> 2178.8
it's flat it doesn't matter that flat

2176.96 --> 2182.0
can be vertical

2178.8 --> 2185.119
or diagonal it doesn't [ __ ] matter

2182.0 --> 2187.68
because it's all flat in one single

2185.119 --> 2189.76
geometric orientation

2187.68 --> 2194.0
and it doesn't matter if it's upside

2189.76 --> 2194.0
down or sloped or anything

2195.2 --> 2200.0789999999997
it's flat

2196.72 --> 2202.3999999999996
flat flat flat

2200.079 --> 2206.4
and beth is just being an oppositionally

2202.4 --> 2206.4
defiant ass about it

2206.48 --> 2211.64
or he's just extremely

2210.16 --> 2214.8799999999997
desperate

2211.64 --> 2218.24
extremely desperate to try and void the

2214.88 --> 2221.28
flatter stigmata yeah that stigma is

2218.24 --> 2224.4399999999996
trying to avoid it because he's a

2221.28 --> 2228.1600000000003
social coward and will not just take

2224.44 --> 2230.079
responsibility to face the triggering to

2228.16 --> 2232.7999999999997
face the conditioning

2230.079 --> 2233.92
specifically designated against us flat

2232.8 --> 2236.2400000000002
earthers

2233.92 --> 2239.28
is just too cowardly

2236.24 --> 2243.64
to take that responsibility on himself

2239.28 --> 2243.6400000000003
yeah that's how i see that

2244.88 --> 2249.52
it's nothing to do with actual

2247.96 --> 2252.8
argumentation

2249.52 --> 2254.4
all of that is just excuses excuses

2252.8 --> 2257.44
excuses

2254.4 --> 2260.0
just not having to call yourself flat

2257.44 --> 2264.2000000000003
earth so you don't get the triggering

2260.0 --> 2264.2
because you're a [ __ ] wussy

2270.079 --> 2274.8
only thing that level earther makes you

2272.56 --> 2276.0789999999997
sound is like a really annoying

2274.8 --> 2277.92
sniveling

2276.079 --> 2281.599
sapster

2277.92 --> 2284.64
that's what that does it's dumb

2281.599 --> 2287.839
it's not smart it's dumb and really

2284.64 --> 2287.839
blatantly obvious

2290.8 --> 2294.6800000000003
except to him probably

2303.839 --> 2306.0789999999997
oh

2309.52 --> 2314.24
okay professor phil i have no idea i was

2311.52 --> 2314.24
talking about you

2315.44 --> 2321.86
right i haven't seen that movie so

2318.75 --> 2321.86
[Applause]

2328.4 --> 2335.1600000000003
a model reflected

2331.359 --> 2335.16
really level bastard

2342.32 --> 2344.96
what model

2345.599 --> 2348.0
what model

2347.119 --> 2350.079
is

2348.0 --> 2354.119
i take it you're talking to me are you

2350.079 --> 2354.119
just generally blabbering

2354.64 --> 2359.1189999999997
model afflicted

2356.4 --> 2361.6800000000003
and what model

2359.119 --> 2361.6800000000003
what model

2362.16 --> 2367.52
yeah what model

2364.4 --> 2370.4
just spawned forth my argumentation can

2367.52 --> 2374.16
you tell me that level bastard

2370.4 --> 2376.8
what's the model that's in afflicting me

2374.16 --> 2378.16
causing me to give you the argumentation

2376.8 --> 2381.48
that i just did

2378.16 --> 2381.48
level bastard

2405.52 --> 2408.319
what argument

2408.64 --> 2414.72
the one that i've been like ranting on

2411.44 --> 2416.8
for like 10 minutes now

2414.72 --> 2419.2799999999997
against you specifically or did you

2416.8 --> 2419.28
forget

2420.48 --> 2424.92
you got this show on mute or something

2434.0 --> 2440.16
we're talking about

2435.52 --> 2443.04
level versus flat as a description

2440.16 --> 2446.3999999999996
for the orientation of earth's surface

2443.04 --> 2446.4
that argument

2446.88 --> 2449.76
yeah

2447.76 --> 2452.5600000000004
that has nothing to do my position

2449.76 --> 2455.3590000000004
within it with model affliction

2452.56 --> 2459.44
because you cannot even tell me

2455.359 --> 2462.0789999999997
what model flattered model i used to

2459.44 --> 2464.88
derive that argument from

2462.079 --> 2469.0
because it's not involved

2464.88 --> 2469.0
you're just straw manning

2486.64 --> 2489.64
okay

2503.68 --> 2507.8799999999997
hey susie has good to see you

2508.56 --> 2511.7599999999998
welsh reese

2517.2 --> 2521.2
okay seems like level bastard just moved

2519.92 --> 2523.119
off

2521.2 --> 2525.2799999999997
i guess he felt he had nowhere left to

2523.119 --> 2525.28
go

2525.76 --> 2532.09
very wise of him

2529.02 --> 2532.09
[Music]

2557.52 --> 2562.72
oh damn it

2559.28 --> 2565.7200000000003
nathan's not doing a live show

2562.72 --> 2565.72
um

2573.599 --> 2576.599
crap

2597.17 --> 2600.289
[Music]

2702.56 --> 2705.7999999999997
hi beth

2705.839 --> 2709.52
i am blocked you yesterday because i

2707.92 --> 2713.359
thought that

2709.52 --> 2713.359
might have been slightly unfair but

2714.48 --> 2718.92
yeah just don't give me lip

2718.96 --> 2723.2400000000002
or i will do the same thing again

2738.56 --> 2741.56
ugh

2746.16 --> 2749.5989999999997
what was that about yesterday

2751.359 --> 2757.2799999999997
just watch the show

2753.839 --> 2759.52
aj though let's see you

2757.28 --> 2762.96
i mean i talked about it like pretty

2759.52 --> 2762.96
much the entire show so

2764.319 --> 2770.7599999999998
yeah okay you can [ __ ] off

2767.119 --> 2770.76
get the [ __ ] out

2779.359 --> 2783.7599999999998
yeah [ __ ] level bastard [ __ ]

2784.319 --> 2789.2
yeah you know how i literally asked you

2786.48 --> 2791.359
to clarify your argument

2789.2 --> 2793.5989999999997
in a very specific way and now you're

2791.359 --> 2796.48
saying model meltdown well go [ __ ]

2793.599 --> 2798.8
yourself i asked you what model

2796.48 --> 2801.2
you didn't even answer

2798.8 --> 2803.2000000000003
even though i asked like three times so

2801.2 --> 2806.56
you can [ __ ] off now with your [ __ ]

2803.2 --> 2806.56
little straw man [ __ ]

2812.0 --> 2817.839
wanna come over and chat no

2814.96 --> 2817.839
no

2827.68 --> 2832.16
no ask and receive are you addressing me

2832.64 --> 2837.839
addressing me is that you giving me lip

2835.2 --> 2837.839
about that too

2838.8 --> 2842.6400000000003
you know what happens when people do

2840.72 --> 2845.359
that in my chat right

2842.64 --> 2849.0
you do realize what happens

2845.359 --> 2849.0
is that what you want

2868.079 --> 2873.8
oh okay oh well [ __ ] off then bye

2883.68 --> 2889.24
hey guns never

2885.76 --> 2889.2400000000002
good see you

2912.839 --> 2918.64
yeah okay i'll just let you take this

2915.76 --> 2923.4
one tony because i don't wanna

2918.64 --> 2923.4
get involved in this semantical noise

2930.16 --> 2933.16
um

2942.64 --> 2945.64
wow

2992.64 --> 2996.96
am i live for one more hour yeah

2997.04 --> 3000.64
yeah nathan sure of course

3011.68 --> 3017.64
i mean i might go on further since

3013.68 --> 3017.64
you're not having a live show

3050.4 --> 3055.1600000000003
all right nathan yeah sure that's fine

3056.48 --> 3058.88
god

3063.76 --> 3066.88
tony look

3066.96 --> 3070.319
you see this is just the [ __ ] that i

3069.28 --> 3072.6400000000003
really

3070.319 --> 3074.68
really do not like about bev is that he

3072.64 --> 3076.96
just will not

3074.68 --> 3078.96
straightforward answer a question if

3076.96 --> 3081.04
somebody asked me a question i

3078.96 --> 3084.2400000000002
immediately answer

3081.04 --> 3086.88
like immediately like faster than they

3084.24 --> 3089.0
want it answered that's how fast i

3086.88 --> 3090.559
answer a question directly

3089.0 --> 3092.4
instantaneously

3090.559 --> 3095.28
beth doesn't do that

3092.4 --> 3098.2400000000002
no he will spend an hour

3095.28 --> 3100.8
just turning around and just never

3098.24 --> 3102.5989999999997
actually doing it

3100.8 --> 3106.079
i find that

3102.599 --> 3107.3590000000004
excruciating i find that an excruciating

3106.079 --> 3110.599
quality

3107.359 --> 3110.5989999999997
of bath

3113.28 --> 3118.96
because he also does it when it's

3115.44 --> 3121.359
completely pointless

3118.96 --> 3123.92
he just likes

3121.359 --> 3125.2799999999997
on a personal note to waste people's

3123.92 --> 3127.28
time

3125.28 --> 3129.52
making them just follow him just turn

3127.28 --> 3130.559
around just never [ __ ] answer the

3129.52 --> 3131.52
question

3130.559 --> 3133.2000000000003
right

3131.52 --> 3135.04
try thinking yeah

3133.2 --> 3137.52
yeah i am okay

3135.04 --> 3138.8
i'm just expressing a little analysis

3137.52 --> 3140.88
about you

3138.8 --> 3143.52
that you literally are on the spot

3140.88 --> 3146.079
demonstrating about not answering

3143.52 --> 3146.079
questions

3148.079 --> 3152.2400000000002
that's why i can't stand you bev that's

3150.48 --> 3153.599
why i don't watch your show because you

3152.24 --> 3156.0789999999997
do that

3153.599 --> 3159.599
you don't just use that trick in an

3156.079 --> 3162.319
emergency no you do it with everybody

3159.599 --> 3163.6800000000003
you waste people's time

3162.319 --> 3167.2
by not

3163.68 --> 3170.16
answering a straightforward question a

3167.2 --> 3172.16
yes or no question

3170.16 --> 3175.2
you just don't do it

3172.16 --> 3177.92
because you're neurotic

3175.2 --> 3180.319
for no damn reason

3177.92 --> 3182.8
yeah the question tony's question that

3180.319 --> 3185.44
he asked like four times in the chat

3182.8 --> 3188.079
does level curve

3185.44 --> 3192.2000000000003
yes or no

3188.079 --> 3192.2000000000003
he asked it four times

3197.44 --> 3200.96
and that doesn't mean all this means

3199.359 --> 3203.359
that and that means that and that means

3200.96 --> 3206.599
that and that means that that means yes

3203.359 --> 3206.5989999999997
or no

3221.76 --> 3223.8390000000004
you

3237.119 --> 3242.599
i can rather than that sure fine

3252.4 --> 3255.4
hello

3275.359 --> 3281.88
all right i can always count on a baller

3278.0 --> 3281.88
to be even dumber

3318.64 --> 3323.2799999999997
now have a territory

3320.88 --> 3325.92
look the point is

3323.28 --> 3327.3590000000004
earth is flat

3325.92 --> 3329.119
there's no

3327.359 --> 3331.52
bloody reason

3329.119 --> 3334.6400000000003
to not just call it that unless you

3331.52 --> 3338.4
specifically want to avoid

3334.64 --> 3341.5989999999997
the conditioned stigma of society

3338.4 --> 3345.6800000000003
as a negative response specifically to

3341.599 --> 3345.6800000000003
the word combination flat earth

3346.16 --> 3349.92
it's not because it's technically an

3347.92 --> 3352.319
argument it's just because he's trying

3349.92 --> 3355.6800000000003
to avoid

3352.319 --> 3355.68
some social effect

3358.319 --> 3361.359
this is what i usually do on my show

3360.24 --> 3363.839
yeah

3361.359 --> 3363.839
absolutely

3365.119 --> 3369.7200000000003
this is what i do at my show that's

3366.72 --> 3369.72
right

3376.65 --> 3379.989
[Music]

3387.44 --> 3392.799
no it's not a

3388.839 --> 3392.799
misnomer the [ __ ]

3396.64 --> 3401.1189999999997
who is bad try thinking

3399.2 --> 3404.52
his actual name is bev

3401.119 --> 3404.52
david 306.

3428.88 --> 3434.1600000000003
not sure why that is getting a hard time

3432.0 --> 3436.079
well he kind of inherited it because

3434.16 --> 3437.52
there were other people

3436.079 --> 3440.4
that were acting

3437.52 --> 3440.4
kind of like him

3443.119 --> 3447.839
and so he got he feels like oh no i need

3445.92 --> 3451.599
to defend that legacy of these

3447.839 --> 3451.599
ridiculous things that i've claimed

3452.319 --> 3457.04
like the black swan is debunked

3457.2 --> 3461.7599999999998
and

3458.16 --> 3465.2
the earth isn't flat it's level

3461.76 --> 3468.96
and i have no ego just these things are

3465.2 --> 3472.0789999999997
quite intolerable to me

3468.96 --> 3474.079
i dressed it all yesterday

3472.079 --> 3476.88
and i did again today and now he's here

3474.079 --> 3478.6400000000003
because apparently he thinks he has to

3476.88 --> 3482.1600000000003
defend his

3478.64 --> 3482.16
genius legacy

3484.079 --> 3489.28
like believing those things actually

3486.079 --> 3491.6800000000003
help you in anything

3489.28 --> 3494.6400000000003
other than just turn into

3491.68 --> 3499.16
truth or hipsters

3494.64 --> 3499.16
they're avoiding social stigma

3507.839 --> 3511.44
i mean

3508.799 --> 3512.799
look bab if you hadn't

3511.44 --> 3515.28
actually

3512.799 --> 3517.2
blabbered out the nonsense of the black

3515.28 --> 3519.28
swan is debunked

3517.2 --> 3522.48
then i probably wouldn't be doing any of

3519.28 --> 3524.6400000000003
this but that one was just so

3522.48 --> 3527.44
[ __ ]

3524.64 --> 3529.2799999999997
and it actually made me hate you i

3527.44 --> 3531.44
thought it was disgusting that you did

3529.28 --> 3533.2000000000003
that actually disgusting like a

3531.44 --> 3536.0
repulsive

3533.2 --> 3538.96
internally demonic pulse that made you

3536.0 --> 3541.28
do that your ego to be more precise that

3538.96 --> 3542.559
you deny exists

3541.28 --> 3544.4
yeah

3542.559 --> 3547.0400000000004
the devil that tells you that it doesn't

3544.4 --> 3549.76
exist yeah that

3547.04 --> 3552.319
i find it quite repulsive

3549.76 --> 3555.119
being a spiritual person and an empath i

3552.319 --> 3558.0
have to warn everybody about that

3555.119 --> 3560.4
especially when it gets in my face

3558.0 --> 3562.319
because i don't get in your face so i

3560.4 --> 3564.4
barely talk about it if you're going to

3562.319 --> 3565.92
get in my face or indirectly through

3564.4 --> 3569.119
other people that think that's a good

3565.92 --> 3572.28
idea then i will address it that's what

3569.119 --> 3572.28
i do

3583.2 --> 3587.5989999999997
see

3584.48 --> 3588.799
right there i mean this man thinks he

3587.599 --> 3591.04
can just

3588.799 --> 3593.04
replace

3591.04 --> 3595.2799999999997
the academy

3593.04 --> 3597.2
he can just replace

3595.28 --> 3601.119
like all the academics

3597.2 --> 3603.1189999999997
he doesn't agree with it he is a garage

3601.119 --> 3605.92
band

3603.119 --> 3605.92
scientist

3610.559 --> 3614.96
he's just gonna do it in his own way

3612.72 --> 3617.04
like that works like it makes sense well

3614.96 --> 3619.68
everybody will think it's really cool

3617.04 --> 3622.0
that you're that rebellious

3619.68 --> 3624.3999999999996
because bev does it its own way it

3622.0 --> 3627.96
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense but he is

3624.4 --> 3627.96
doing it anyway

3650.4 --> 3655.6800000000003
yeah woodworking gunny bear that's right

3653.599 --> 3659.2000000000003
but that's look

3655.68 --> 3661.2799999999997
the confrontation is the entire point

3659.2 --> 3663.9199999999996
it's the confrontation that's the point

3661.28 --> 3665.6800000000003
if you don't confront with hey it's flat

3663.92 --> 3669.04
then you don't address the conditioning

3665.68 --> 3670.3999999999996
then you don't awaken them you're just a

3669.04 --> 3673.2
blabbering

3670.4 --> 3676.799
wannabe intellectual hipster

3673.2 --> 3680.3999999999996
who is too afraid to actually help solve

3676.799 --> 3682.079
the problem through confrontation yeah

3680.4 --> 3686.4
you know how you snap people out of

3682.079 --> 3686.4
something you confront them

3686.64 --> 3692.64
what you do

3688.24 --> 3692.64
is how to avoid that

3694.0 --> 3697.0
pointless

3700.64 --> 3705.359
well it's not about you

3703.68 --> 3706.72
that's the whole point it's not about

3705.359 --> 3710.72
you bev

3706.72 --> 3713.839
what i'm saying is not even about you

3710.72 --> 3713.839
it's about what you do

3715.839 --> 3720.16
what did i do yeah well why are you

3718.24 --> 3722.5589999999997
asking me what you did

3720.16 --> 3723.92
when i'm literally telling you what you

3722.559 --> 3727.039
did

3723.92 --> 3729.039
it's on record i'm telling you i'm

3727.039 --> 3731.8390000000004
telling you what you did why do you ask

3729.039 --> 3733.44
what did i do because i literally just

3731.839 --> 3736.16
told you did you forget it you just

3733.44 --> 3737.76
blank it out are you like blanking out

3736.16 --> 3739.52
now quickly

3737.76 --> 3740.4
are you getting some

3739.52 --> 3742.559
some

3740.4 --> 3745.039
potential

3742.559 --> 3747.76
double thinking processes going are you

3745.039 --> 3750.0
ready for the double speak yet eh bev

3747.76 --> 3752.559
you ready for the double speak

3750.0 --> 3754.16
gonna ask me questions about exactly

3752.559 --> 3757.2000000000003
what i've been talking about like the

3754.16 --> 3757.2
second you asked

3762.24 --> 3766.4799999999996
is hipster the new hippie no it's

3764.16 --> 3766.48
different

3767.599 --> 3773.3590000000004
hipsters are not hippies

3769.52 --> 3773.359
hippies actually have community

3780.0 --> 3783.839
hipsters only have followers

3793.599 --> 3797.6800000000003
okay

3794.64 --> 3800.8799999999997
well tony just like to remind you that's

3797.68 --> 3802.24
not how wrenches are used here but i

3800.88 --> 3804.2400000000002
agree

3802.24 --> 3806.0789999999997
he's just being an ass the point was

3804.24 --> 3808.0
though i wanted to just show what

3806.079 --> 3811.119
happens when you actually let him be

3808.0 --> 3814.079
himself in the chat

3811.119 --> 3816.4
he starts to act like an ass

3814.079 --> 3819.44
doing exactly how i've described him

3816.4 --> 3822.079
exactly what i said

3819.44 --> 3825.44
like an animal performing a trick

3822.079 --> 3827.3590000000004
exactly as as trained

3825.44 --> 3828.799
that's what bev does

3827.359 --> 3832.2799999999997
and that's why i think he's a complete

3828.799 --> 3832.28
waste of time

3838.96 --> 3843.76
you will now get told off by

3841.52 --> 3843.7599999999998
yeah

3849.599 --> 3853.039
yeah

3851.599 --> 3854.1600000000003
i'm just

3853.039 --> 3856.7990000000004
trying

3854.16 --> 3859.68
i know tony i know that

3856.799 --> 3862.4
so am i but you're not supposed to use

3859.68 --> 3864.8799999999997
look the wrenches here are for you to be

3862.4 --> 3867.599
able to identify accounts

3864.88 --> 3870.1600000000003
see whether they're the real one

3867.599 --> 3872.079
it's for identification purposes for me

3870.16 --> 3873.68
too so that i know it's not a sock troll

3872.079 --> 3875.28
of somebody

3873.68 --> 3878.799
and

3875.28 --> 3881.28
for like real like

3878.799 --> 3882.96
yeah for actual trolls people that it's

3881.28 --> 3885.3590000000004
just soccer cons and are spamming and

3882.96 --> 3886.7200000000003
[ __ ] because don't

3885.359 --> 3888.24
time out

3886.72 --> 3889.9199999999996
somebody that's actually having a

3888.24 --> 3892.5589999999997
conversation if they're even if they're

3889.92 --> 3895.839
just being an ass

3892.559 --> 3895.8390000000004
just leave it to me

3896.48 --> 3900.64
although i was actually about to do that

3899.92 --> 3902.559
so

3900.64 --> 3904.0
that's why i'm not just super pissed off

3902.559 --> 3906.559
at you right now

3904.0 --> 3909.839
because he's just

3906.559 --> 3909.8390000000004
being super annoying

3914.16 --> 3919.2
but it's bev tony

3917.44 --> 3920.7200000000003
besides how is he going to answer your

3919.2 --> 3922.64
question if you if you can't talk for

3920.72 --> 3924.48
five minutes

3922.64 --> 3927.2
it's bad so he's not gonna he's not

3924.48 --> 3927.2
gonna answer

3934.0 --> 3940.16
that is an important part excuse me

3936.88 --> 3943.52
speak for yourself nathan

3940.16 --> 3943.52
not part of my community

3944.0 --> 3949.28
i mean he literally denounces the very

3946.64 --> 3951.839
foundational word how is that a part of

3949.28 --> 3951.8390000000004
our community

3954.799 --> 3958.88
that's like

3956.64 --> 3960.96
weird con

3958.88 --> 3965.92
that's like saying like your

3960.96 --> 3968.7200000000003
gothic asha w communist revolutionary

3965.92 --> 3970.799
kid is part of the family when they're

3968.72 --> 3972.48
obviously not part of the family and

3970.799 --> 3975.119
they hate you

3972.48 --> 3976.839
and they like walked away from it's like

3975.119 --> 3979.92
no no he

3976.839 --> 3982.72
isn't he literally

3979.92 --> 3985.039
spends hours and hours and hours

3982.72 --> 3987.7599999999998
arguing that you shouldn't call it flat

3985.039 --> 3991.5200000000004
earth i'm sorry how is he a part of our

3987.76 --> 3993.8390000000004
community of flat earthers

3991.52 --> 3993.839
nathan

3997.2 --> 4001.9199999999996
why would he come back well he got

3998.96 --> 4004.319
banned yesterday nathan and he came back

4001.92 --> 4004.319
anyway

4004.72 --> 4007.359
so

4005.68 --> 4010.64
i don't think timing him out is gonna

4007.359 --> 4010.64
actually repel him

4019.039 --> 4026.92
what the [ __ ] are you saying

4021.28 --> 4026.92
jedo what the [ __ ] are you saying

4060.48 --> 4066.16

i mean hey

4096.64 --> 4101.679
yeah flood earth is may hang around

4099.759 --> 4103.52
bev and all that and he may have his own

4101.679 --> 4105.92
platform and people might actually be

4103.52 --> 4108.0
halfway interested what is the hipster

4105.92 --> 4108.96
lord has to say

4108.0 --> 4110.799
okay

4108.96 --> 4114.319
he's not part of our community he

4110.799 --> 4114.319
literally denounces it

4115.359 --> 4119.679
he denounces our arguments he denounces

4118.239 --> 4122.08
our name

4119.679 --> 4125.1990000000005
nathan oakley

4122.08 --> 4127.44
he literally denounces us

4125.199 --> 4130.4
do you understand

4127.44 --> 4133.44
he is not part of our community he

4130.4 --> 4137.679
literally denounces the fundamental

4133.44 --> 4141.919999999999
arguments and he denounces the name

4137.679 --> 4141.92
not part of the

4144.839 --> 4150.0
community i mean unless you mean the

4147.44 --> 4155.0
youtube community which includes like

4150.0 --> 4155.0
another 100 million retards

4169.52 --> 4176.839000000001
he's not the flat earth community nathan

4172.48 --> 4176.839
he isn't give it up

4188.38 --> 4191.63
[Applause]

4217.679 --> 4222.88
no the show is not about opinions gadget

4220.32 --> 4222.88
inspector

4228.719 --> 4235.08
this show is not about opinions where

4230.96 --> 4235.08
the hell did you even get that

4248.48 --> 4252.959999999999
okay fair enough woodworking gunny bear

4252.0 --> 4255.12
but

4252.96 --> 4256.4800000000005
yeah technically he's an anti-flat

4255.12 --> 4259.04
earther

4256.48 --> 4261.44
well look if you want to classify

4259.04 --> 4264.48
bev as an anti-flat earther just like a

4261.44 --> 4268.0
kumu virus i'd be okay with that i mean

4264.48 --> 4271.12
he literally denounces the name

4268.0 --> 4274.4
and says the like core arguments are

4271.12 --> 4277.12
debunked yeah that's pretty anti-flat

4274.4 --> 4279.12
earth so i agree dev is kind of like a

4277.12 --> 4282.32
kumu virus in that sense he is part of

4279.12 --> 4285.04
the community as in the people we sort

4282.32 --> 4287.92
of hang around with

4285.04 --> 4290.0
and he's not a flat earther he's not

4287.92 --> 4292.08
part of the flat earth community he

4290.0 --> 4295.04
literally denounces it

4292.08 --> 4297.92
stop saying he's part of the community

4295.04 --> 4297.92
he is not

4299.52 --> 4304.320000000001
yeah i like flat earthers yes yes yeah

4301.92 --> 4306.88
that's what that's what professor phil

4304.32 --> 4307.92
bell also says

4306.88 --> 4311.6
yeah

4307.92 --> 4311.6
he likes flat earthers too

4313.04 --> 4317.44
and akumavirus also loves talking to

4315.44 --> 4322.839999999999
people and he's so interested in talking

4317.44 --> 4322.839999999999
to flattered we know that we know

4336.64 --> 4341.4800000000005
you've always been pushed over my

4338.48 --> 4341.48
community

4342.08 --> 4347.199
because you

4343.44 --> 4347.199
say absolute horseshit

4347.28 --> 4351.599999999999
yeah

4349.36 --> 4356.28
you have like a severe social

4351.6 --> 4356.280000000001
derangement in plain sight

4357.199 --> 4363.599999999999
how can i like i cannot

4360.0 --> 4364.719
accept deranged people in my circle like

4363.6 --> 4367.120000000001
that

4364.719 --> 4368.159
i have enough deranged people that stalk

4367.12 --> 4371.76
me

4368.159 --> 4374.4
already in the chats okay

4371.76 --> 4377.4400000000005
don't have room for

4374.4 --> 4379.5199999999995
friendly deranged people because they

4377.44 --> 4381.599999999999
suck you suck

4379.52 --> 4383.52
you're always trying to push your

4381.6 --> 4385.6
[ __ ]

4383.52 --> 4389.360000000001
your way

4385.6 --> 4389.360000000001
i'm not gonna do it your way

4393.679 --> 4399.28
i think it's [ __ ] it's a waste of

4395.76 --> 4401.84
time and you're an annoying hipster

4399.28 --> 4404.96
that's what i really think

4401.84 --> 4407.360000000001
that's my opinion

4404.96 --> 4410.84
an opinion that i can elaborately argue

4407.36 --> 4410.839999999999
and that i have

4412.08 --> 4419.679
i mean people that say the black swan is

4414.719 --> 4419.679
debunked have no room here

4420.239 --> 4428.159
yeah i've ki i've kicked trolls out for

4423.28 --> 4429.5199999999995
even saying things like that yeah

4428.159 --> 4431.44
so

4429.52 --> 4433.679
yeah

4431.44 --> 4436.678999999999
it's just i don't accept

4433.679 --> 4436.679
done

4443.76 --> 4450.08
yeah okay five roads but it's a good

4445.92 --> 4452.159
point but to be fair so does jim bob

4450.08 --> 4454.48
well no that's actually not true he

4452.159 --> 4456.32
actually jim bob has actually sort of

4454.48 --> 4457.759999999999
kicked brenna out

4456.32 --> 4461.12
as well

4457.76 --> 4461.12
so yeah good point

4461.6 --> 4465.8
how are you doing by the way five roads

4474.719 --> 4479.6
robert don't encourage beth you don't

4477.36 --> 4482.599999999999
have to tell him nobody can change his

4479.6 --> 4482.6
mind

4496.159 --> 4501.36
look i know all about stubborn

4498.8 --> 4503.76
resistance okay i mean

4501.36 --> 4506.0
i've had to do that with the freaking

4503.76 --> 4507.84
holographic nature of the celestials and

4506.0 --> 4511.52
it's still ongoing

4507.84 --> 4514.4800000000005
starting six years ago okay

4511.52 --> 4515.76
i know what it is to be like an odd odd

4514.48 --> 4519.199
one out

4515.76 --> 4521.1990000000005
always holding on to their own ways

4519.199 --> 4523.759999999999
nobody understands them yeah you know

4521.199 --> 4525.839999999999
they can actually really elaborately

4523.76 --> 4528.8
argue it and i have

4525.84 --> 4532.4800000000005
and everybody has caught up to it

4528.8 --> 4534.8
for real in actual modeling in actual

4532.48 --> 4537.28
understanding not just a bunch of

4534.8 --> 4539.04
nonsense semantics

4537.28 --> 4543.12
not just the new

4539.04 --> 4546.239
mechanical sjw more politically correct

4543.12 --> 4548.4
way of talking about flat earth i mean

4546.239 --> 4550.4
horse [ __ ] dude everything that comes

4548.4 --> 4553.36
out you is horseshit

4550.4 --> 4555.92
we don't need that crap

4553.36 --> 4558.08
people already have [ __ ] tendencies

4555.92 --> 4561.04
by their own they don't need this

4558.08 --> 4562.8
[ __ ] inserted in them as well

4561.04 --> 4567.5199999999995
okay

4562.8 --> 4571.92
don't need semantical alterations

4567.52 --> 4575.040000000001
you need to understand it exactly as is

4571.92 --> 4577.76
the original words mean everything

4575.04 --> 4581.56
so much understanding is revealed by

4577.76 --> 4581.56
using the words

4597.28 --> 4600.28
huh

4611.12 --> 4615.76
oh [ __ ]

4613.36 --> 4620.28
oh robert that sucks

4615.76 --> 4620.280000000001
i hope that works out damn

4638.159 --> 4642.5599999999995
to miss this

4640.0 --> 4645.36
yeah usually like the last half hour

4642.56 --> 4646.64
always gets very animated in my show

4645.36 --> 4648.5599999999995
nathan

4646.64 --> 4651.1990000000005
it's also the time when all the trolls

4648.56 --> 4654.0
just start lining up

4651.199 --> 4655.919999999999
it's like our win show the first the

4654.0 --> 4658.0
last half hour is like the first stop

4655.92 --> 4660.0
for all the trolls

4658.0 --> 4663.96
to like get a drink before they just

4660.0 --> 4663.96
dive onto your show

4664.96 --> 4668.08
no fiber oats

4669.36 --> 4672.92
it's not computer

4682.719 --> 4686.8
yeah that's right tony he is an

4684.8 --> 4687.679
anti-flat earthers i told i totally

4686.8 --> 4689.52
agree

4687.679 --> 4691.679
let's just put it together he's an

4689.52 --> 4694.4800000000005
anti-flat earther pretending to be a

4691.679 --> 4697.28
flat earther except if you actually ask

4694.48 --> 4701.199
about you say no no

4697.28 --> 4701.199
sounds like an anti-flat earther to me

4704.32 --> 4709.5199999999995
okay yeah you can [ __ ] off now gadget i

4707.04 --> 4713.04
really don't want to see you again

4709.52 --> 4713.040000000001
you just suck man

4715.199 --> 4718.839999999999
you just suck

4724.08 --> 4728.4
it's a closet glober yeah but that

4726.56 --> 4730.88
doesn't really work

4728.4 --> 4735.0
it's anti-flat earther you can't really

4730.88 --> 4735.0
become a glober again

4771.76 --> 4774.76
hmm

4781.44 --> 4783.678999999999
see

4788.719 --> 4796.159
and that nathan is why

4792.48 --> 4797.678999999999
bev is not a part of our community

4796.159 --> 4799.5199999999995
unless you want to classify him in the

4797.679 --> 4801.4400000000005
same category as a

4799.52 --> 4803.360000000001
kumu virus

4801.44 --> 4805.599999999999
by the way i think is a lot less

4803.36 --> 4808.599999999999
annoying than him and that's saying

4805.6 --> 4808.6
something

4841.04 --> 4847.239
okay woodworking gunny bear interesting

4843.12 --> 4847.239
question the answer is no

4849.84 --> 4854.639
just because

4852.159 --> 4856.799999999999
the angles of the celestials might seem

4854.639 --> 4858.56
to line up in some

4856.8 --> 4860.96
type of way

4858.56 --> 4863.84
that would suggest

4860.96 --> 4865.52
that the origin points of the light are

4863.84 --> 4868.719
in exact

4865.52 --> 4871.1990000000005
locations in the euclidean space

4868.719 --> 4872.96
doesn't mean that they actually are

4871.199 --> 4875.919999999999
you'd have to confirm that by

4872.96 --> 4878.08
approaching that point in space and

4875.92 --> 4879.1990000000005
we attempt to

4878.08 --> 4880.8
and then

4879.199 --> 4884.159
well

4880.8 --> 4885.92
measure the required signs

4884.159 --> 4889.679
like

4885.92 --> 4891.4400000000005
radiation heat for example with the sun

4889.679 --> 4892.639
angular size increase that would

4891.44 --> 4895.44
directly

4892.639 --> 4897.6
tell you that it isn't an approach of an

4895.44 --> 4899.12
object because that happens when you do

4897.6 --> 4900.88
that

4899.12 --> 4902.639
all these factors right and it would

4900.88 --> 4905.1990000000005
have to turn out to actually be there

4902.639 --> 4905.1990000000005
well it isn't

4913.36 --> 4916.799999999999
see

4914.48 --> 4919.28
it's just ad homing right now it's just

4916.8 --> 4920.400000000001
straw manning this [ __ ]

4919.28 --> 4922.719
i mean

4920.4 --> 4925.12
hey hey bad bad

4922.719 --> 4927.44
try thinking how are you being different

4925.12 --> 4930.88
from which it gets it now

4927.44 --> 4933.199
how are you being different

4930.88 --> 4936.0
in the end every only thing he was doing

4933.199 --> 4938.5599999999995
is just whining oh you're straw manning

4936.0 --> 4942.4
straw manning

4938.56 --> 4945.4400000000005
you're not even saying anything anymore

4942.4 --> 4947.92
just throwing out stupid accusations

4945.44 --> 4950.879999999999
that and don't

4947.92 --> 4950.88
do anything now

4956.159 --> 4959.159
wow

4959.199 --> 4963.049999999999
amazing

4959.88 --> 4963.05
[Music]

4966.4 --> 4971.44
i'm too old see he thinks he's super

4969.12 --> 4973.92
special i mean

4971.44 --> 4976.239
dude you can prove that love was

4973.92 --> 4980.8
horizontal that makes him the ultimate

4976.239 --> 4980.799999999999
special boy you don't need anything else

4981.36 --> 4986.719
this is core this is his religion i mean

4984.48 --> 4990.239
he can prove that

4986.719 --> 4993.92
the horizontal is level i mean holy [ __ ]

4990.239 --> 4996.959999999999
man that's like wizardry or something

4993.92 --> 4998.4
holy [ __ ] man he's the the keeper of the

4996.96 --> 5001.28
great secret

4998.4 --> 5002.719
of being able to prove that horizontal

5001.28 --> 5005.5199999999995
is level i mean

5002.719 --> 5007.52
what more information do you need now

5005.52 --> 5009.76
you know everything

5007.52 --> 5012.639
because you understand that

5009.76 --> 5015.52
yeah and you think that i'm exaggerating

5012.639 --> 5018.4800000000005
well welcome to beth people

5015.52 --> 5022.96
he literally spends hours and hours and

5018.48 --> 5022.959999999999
hours arguing exactly this

5024.0 --> 5028.679
a giant waste of time

5037.84 --> 5042.08
right so please donate to my paypal by

5040.239 --> 5043.599999999999
the way

5042.08 --> 5047.36
because i don't know what the hell bev

5043.6 --> 5049.52
does or he's probably too proud

5047.36 --> 5051.44
because he doesn't have an ego right so

5049.52 --> 5052.719
that typically happens that you're too

5051.44 --> 5055.04
proud

5052.719 --> 5056.96
if you don't have an ego

5055.04 --> 5059.12
but yeah i definitely need money

5056.96 --> 5063.679
especially because of the dutch energy

5059.12 --> 5063.679
calamity that has reached my doors

5063.84 --> 5068.08
no idea i'm gonna pull through this

5065.84 --> 5071.4400000000005
seriously i have i am in trouble

5068.08 --> 5074.239
financially so i could really use

5071.44 --> 5076.719
paypal donations on the short run even

5074.239 --> 5078.32
because yeah i still also need money for

5076.719 --> 5080.159
food

5078.32 --> 5085.84
so please donate to my paypal that would

5080.159 --> 5085.839999999999
be great sign up with my patreon as well

5087.28 --> 5094.08
and keep me going

5090.48 --> 5094.08
laying it out how it is

5094.239 --> 5099.638999999999
and who is

5096.0 --> 5099.639
and what they're doing

5108.639 --> 5112.4800000000005
right because if you don't i'm gonna go

5110.719 --> 5116.0
hungry and then at some point i'm just

5112.48 --> 5116.0
not gonna come online anymore

5119.199 --> 5123.919999999999
it's not a threat that's a logical

5121.36 --> 5126.48
consequence

5123.92 --> 5127.92
and a lot of it is out of my hands

5126.48 --> 5130.159
because i

5127.92 --> 5132.0
do not have control over the energy

5130.159 --> 5134.799999999999
pricings here

5132.0 --> 5136.56
it is getting to zimbabwe levels

5134.8 --> 5138.320000000001
although yeah it's not the same thing of

5136.56 --> 5141.04
course because

5138.32 --> 5143.599999999999
it was like printing they did it there

5141.04 --> 5145.28
but the energy like our government has

5143.6 --> 5148.56
cut us off

5145.28 --> 5150.48
like literally cut us off energy

5148.56 --> 5153.120000000001
so that there's just not energy anymore

5150.48 --> 5156.718999999999
and it's so sparse that it's gone up in

5153.12 --> 5161.199
price five to ten times

5156.719 --> 5162.96
that includes industry this is a giant

5161.199 --> 5165.04
giant calamity

5162.96 --> 5167.12
if there is not some kind of resolve one

5165.04 --> 5170.32
way or another

5167.12 --> 5172.719
with bloodshed if necessary

5170.32 --> 5176.159
because yeah

5172.719 --> 5180.0
otherwise this country will be utterly

5176.159 --> 5183.04
destroyed and i mean destroyed as in

5180.0 --> 5185.199
total infrastructure collapse

5183.04 --> 5186.639
everything collapse

5185.199 --> 5189.5199999999995
like all

5186.639 --> 5192.159000000001
foundational electronics

5189.52 --> 5194.320000000001
just to like run water

5192.159 --> 5196.48
cleaning facilities

5194.32 --> 5200.0
everything will be shut down

5196.48 --> 5202.879999999999
and this country could turn into like a

5200.0 --> 5205.6
third world trash heap

5202.88 --> 5208.32
in a matter of a year

5205.6 --> 5209.6
if this is not resolved this is

5208.32 --> 5213.44
probably

5209.6 --> 5213.4400000000005
the worst dutch crisis

5213.92 --> 5218.08
ever

5214.8 --> 5220.08
this this could be worse than the flood

5218.08 --> 5222.4
like that flood that happened early 20th

5220.08 --> 5223.84
century this is probably going to be

5222.4 --> 5225.759999999999
worse

5223.84 --> 5228.4800000000005
if we don't get this under control

5225.76 --> 5230.4800000000005
basically execute the government

5228.48 --> 5232.239
i mean execute

5230.48 --> 5234.32
line them up

5232.239 --> 5237.678999999999
[ __ ] chop their heads off

5234.32 --> 5239.92
all of them just not not one guy no all

5237.679 --> 5241.6
of them

5239.92 --> 5244.32
finish him off

5241.6 --> 5246.400000000001
get a new deal get out of this [ __ ]

5244.32 --> 5249.04
[ __ ]

5246.4 --> 5252.5599999999995
war games these financial

5249.04 --> 5254.96
industrial war games get it out of it

5252.56 --> 5254.96
and then

5255.12 --> 5258.239
just

5256.239 --> 5260.32
attempt to get

5258.239 --> 5263.12
restoration

5260.32 --> 5264.08
of just basic functions here

5263.12 --> 5266.5599999999995
because

5264.08 --> 5269.76
this is a serious calamity i mean this

5266.56 --> 5272.96
could literally be the end of my country

5269.76 --> 5274.88
as in being a recognizable country that

5272.96 --> 5276.96
could happen this year

5274.88 --> 5279.76
here

5276.96 --> 5282.4800000000005
the pricing is so disastrous

5279.76 --> 5284.719
it is either guaranteed to become a

5282.48 --> 5286.4
complete total financial collapse where

5284.719 --> 5289.28
there's going to be so much that there's

5286.4 --> 5292.0
like going to be 10 times the amount

5289.28 --> 5293.36
of entire brute

5292.0 --> 5296.159
income

5293.36 --> 5297.92
in debt for everybody like it's either

5296.159 --> 5300.199
going to be that or

5297.92 --> 5301.84
government functionaries are going to be

5300.199 --> 5303.839999999999
executed

5301.84 --> 5307.360000000001
dead

5303.84 --> 5307.360000000001
like provably dead

5307.44 --> 5313.199
yeah or fleeing but mostly dead once

5311.04 --> 5316.88
that starts i definitely recommend to

5313.199 --> 5316.879999999999
not letting any of them leave

5317.76 --> 5322.96
and then finishing them off and then

5320.159 --> 5324.5599999999995
form a new government with what's left

5322.96 --> 5326.4800000000005
that's going to have to take completely

5324.56 --> 5327.4400000000005
different routes and those routes will

5326.48 --> 5330.879999999999
be

5327.44 --> 5333.12
hundreds of times better

5330.88 --> 5335.1990000000005
it won't be ideal because it's still

5333.12 --> 5337.599999999999
basically like a war situation but it

5335.199 --> 5340.239
will be a hundred times better than the

5337.6 --> 5342.96
guaranteed soviet

5340.239 --> 5346.239
hunger slaughter that we're going to be

5342.96 --> 5348.719
subjected to they're pulling a soviet

5346.239 --> 5352.0
ukraine on us right now do you

5348.719 --> 5354.32
understand they're pulling a soviet

5352.0 --> 5357.28
ukraine on us

5354.32 --> 5359.199
here right now

5357.28 --> 5361.599999999999
remember that

5359.199 --> 5364.4
remember how the soviets literally

5361.6 --> 5365.6
starved millions of people in the

5364.4 --> 5369.12
ukraine

5365.6 --> 5371.84
do you remember that that was like

5369.12 --> 5374.08
decades ago oh yes

5371.84 --> 5375.6
or like a half a century ago but that

5374.08 --> 5378.639
happened

5375.6 --> 5380.08
that's that's what they did they just

5378.639 --> 5383.92
said uh

5380.08 --> 5386.239
you just don't get food anymore

5383.92 --> 5386.2390000000005
die

5386.4 --> 5390.839999999999
that's what's happening right now here

5388.32 --> 5393.759999999999
in the netherlands it's getting to

5390.84 --> 5395.92
that and in my vision

5393.76 --> 5397.1990000000005
a vision that i've held for over 20

5395.92 --> 5399.52
years

5397.199 --> 5401.919999999999
there's only one way out and that is to

5399.52 --> 5405.92
kill them

5401.92 --> 5407.84
[ __ ] um up no more [ __ ] no more

5405.92 --> 5410.719

if i'm gonna do it it's not gonna be for

5472.639 --> 5476.400000000001
nothing i will not just throw away my

5475.44 --> 5480.08
life

5476.4 --> 5482.719
for some stupid weenie spectacle

5480.08 --> 5484.48
yeah i'm not gonna kill myself i'm not

5482.719 --> 5485.92
gonna waste

5484.48 --> 5489.04
my power

5485.92 --> 5491.1990000000005
with some singular isolated incident

5489.04 --> 5493.84
that's not going to amount to anything i

5491.199 --> 5496.32
want an organized national effort to

5493.84 --> 5499.1990000000005
execute this government

5496.32 --> 5500.96
to kill them

5499.199 --> 5502.5599999999995
that's what i want

5500.96 --> 5505.28
thank you professor phil bell for the

5502.56 --> 5508.080000000001
paypal that is helpful

5505.28 --> 5508.08
thank you very much

5514.0 --> 5519.679
i want these people in government to die

5516.88 --> 5523.1990000000005
i want to see them dead i want the media

5519.679 --> 5523.1990000000005
filled with their corpses

5527.52 --> 5535.6
i want to see the media filled with

5531.84 --> 5538.96
their corpses i want to see them dead i

5535.6 --> 5545.0
want to see these politicians dead photo

5538.96 --> 5545.0
shots of their corpses i want to see it

5579.92 --> 5583.76
checking to see if the neighbors are

5581.6 --> 5585.84
able to complain

5583.76 --> 5589.8
oh they might

5585.84 --> 5589.8
i think they're used to it

5590.0 --> 5594.4
besides if they hear what i'm saying

5592.4 --> 5596.5599999999995
they're probably agreeing

5594.4 --> 5598.4
because everybody is getting [ __ ] so

5596.56 --> 5600.4800000000005
hard it's just the problem everybody's

5598.4 --> 5603.04
just too complacent

5600.48 --> 5605.678999999999
to migrate to this frequency they're too

5603.04 --> 5608.48
complacent

5605.679 --> 5610.719
it's easier to just choose to wither

5608.48 --> 5613.28
away

5610.719 --> 5615.04
that's the problem here the problem is

5613.28 --> 5617.599999999999
that people

5615.04 --> 5622.239
are just too capable of letting it

5617.6 --> 5622.2390000000005
happen and withering away and die

5622.56 --> 5629.88
they're not ready for bloodshed

5625.6 --> 5629.88
i am ready for bloodshed

5635.84 --> 5638.159000000001
ah

5639.6 --> 5643.679
is this the flutter community you're

5641.04 --> 5645.5199999999995
missing out on no this is just me this

5643.679 --> 5647.36
is just me or that

5645.52 --> 5650.0
don't worry about it nathan doesn't do

5647.36 --> 5651.28
this i do this this is my thing

5650.0 --> 5654.32
i do this

5651.28 --> 5656.639
i'm an oracle i channel these things

5654.32 --> 5660.08
i channel the honesty even if that gets

5656.639 --> 5663.12
me killed even if that gets me mars

5660.08 --> 5665.76
monstrous reputation i channel

5663.12 --> 5669.5199999999995
the rawest

5665.76 --> 5671.280000000001
most unwanted truth inside the actual

5669.52 --> 5673.92
inside truth the things that actually

5671.28 --> 5676.159
get you hurt when you expose them that's

5673.92 --> 5678.4800000000005
what i channel i show it i show what is

5676.159 --> 5678.48
real

5678.719 --> 5684.32
in a warning a warning to people this is

5682.0 --> 5686.4
what's gonna happen i've been warning

5684.32 --> 5690.48
for this [ __ ]

5686.4 --> 5691.36
for years for half a decade

5690.48 --> 5694.0
and

5691.36 --> 5696.0
yeah before that arguably

5694.0 --> 5700.36
we've been warned like i've been

5696.0 --> 5700.36
consciously warned since like 2006.

5703.84 --> 5710.2390000000005
but i've been pretty much harping on

5705.84 --> 5711.92
this there's gonna be extreme violence

5710.239 --> 5713.839999999999
and you're gonna hope

5711.92 --> 5715.679
there is gonna be extreme violence

5713.84 --> 5719.119000000001
because if there isn't going to be

5715.679 --> 5723.4400000000005
extreme violence then there will be dead

5719.119 --> 5723.44
rotting corpses everywhere

5724.0 --> 5729.0
and everybody you know will die

5729.04 --> 5734.88
yeah so i'd rather have a

5732.4 --> 5737.679
brutal bloody revolt

5734.88 --> 5741.56
than to just have everything i know

5737.679 --> 5741.56
wither and die

5750.719 --> 5753.719
ah

5772.08 --> 5775.36
what the hell is going on with energy

5774.08 --> 5777.92
we're being

5775.36 --> 5779.199
besieged nathan

5777.92 --> 5781.6
you too

5779.199 --> 5784.08
i mean all of europe is in england too

5781.6 --> 5787.52
we're being besieged

5784.08 --> 5789.92
this is a fast fascist siege

5787.52 --> 5792.400000000001
where a political group

5789.92 --> 5795.4400000000005
that has taken fascist control also

5792.4 --> 5796.48
through companies are literally cutting

5795.44 --> 5799.04
off

5796.48 --> 5802.32
on purpose the energy industries inside

5799.04 --> 5805.84
the country everybody's country

5802.32 --> 5808.719
and then saying that that is

5805.84 --> 5811.4400000000005
like part of the war against russia

5808.719 --> 5813.28
literally they're literally cutting your

5811.44 --> 5815.5199999999995
energy off and then telling you it's

5813.28 --> 5819.84
because of russia

5815.52 --> 5821.360000000001
it is a straight out siege takeover lie

5819.84 --> 5824.84
this is war

5821.36 --> 5828.639
they deserve the death

5824.84 --> 5832.159000000001
penalty chopping blocks heads rolling

5828.639 --> 5834.719
blood spraying death penalty

5832.159 --> 5836.4
this is death penalty worthy what

5834.719 --> 5839.719
they're doing right now

5836.4 --> 5839.719
death penalty

5851.76 --> 5857.04
yeah

5852.96 --> 5857.92
and the craziest ass thing about it is

5857.04 --> 5859.44
it's

5857.92 --> 5861.4400000000005
this simple

5859.44 --> 5862.638999999999
to turn it back on just

5861.44 --> 5864.159
click

5862.639 --> 5865.84
done

5864.159 --> 5869.599999999999

our infrastructure

5876.159 --> 5880.96
our communication

5877.92 --> 5884.4800000000005
our financial system on purpose as a

5880.96 --> 5887.76
siege to kill us

5884.48 --> 5890.718999999999
to destroy us enslave us weaken us call

5887.76 --> 5895.56
our numbers this is war

5890.719 --> 5895.56
they deserve the death penalty

5897.36 --> 5907.96
kill them and turn the switch back on

5902.159 --> 5907.96
finish them off you have to do it

5937.28 --> 5943.5199999999995

they're not gonna stop until blood

6066.48 --> 6071.0
starts spraying out of them

6085.76 --> 6090.719
how long are you gonna continue

6088.48 --> 6094.32
to let yourself be hypnotized by

6090.719 --> 6096.88
mainstream media demon [ __ ] before

6094.32 --> 6100.0

[ __ ] prison

6195.84 --> 6199.88
everybody's gonna be dead

6217.84 --> 6219.92
you

6231.92 --> 6237.04
one recourse only

6234.239 --> 6238.08
pick your weapons up

6237.04 --> 6240.639
move

6238.08 --> 6242.8
to the places where these people in

6240.639 --> 6246.639
government that are organizing this are

6242.8 --> 6248.08
and kill them all at once all of them

6246.639 --> 6251.119
everywhere

6248.08 --> 6251.119
all at the same time

6252.96 --> 6257.36
just move

6254.56 --> 6260.159000000001
do it nobody gives a [ __ ]

6257.36 --> 6262.88
dude prisons are not even going to exist

6260.159 --> 6264.5599999999995
in that fashion afterward

6262.88 --> 6267.36
what do you think you're going to just

6264.56 --> 6271.119000000001
turn back to normal society after this

6267.36 --> 6273.759999999999
one way or another no it's over

6271.119 --> 6277.599999999999
format that we knew is gone it's already

6273.76 --> 6280.639
gone it's never ever coming back

6277.6 --> 6282.8
it's just slowly being tortured to death

6280.639 --> 6285.04
or there's gonna be a bloody revolution

6282.8 --> 6288.4800000000005
and then it's gonna change afterward

6285.04 --> 6290.48
is no returning

6288.48 --> 6292.959999999999
so which one's going to be slow

6290.48 --> 6296.48
withering death and torture

6292.96 --> 6296.4800000000005
or take a risk

6296.88 --> 6299.119
yeah

6299.28 --> 6304.0
remember that that's what our ancestors

6301.6 --> 6306.2390000000005
used to do take a [ __ ] risk they

6304.0 --> 6309.36
would risk their own lives they would

6306.239 --> 6311.119
risk their own lives in war

6309.36 --> 6313.199
war of dominance

6311.119 --> 6314.88
or riches or anything they would

6313.199 --> 6317.5199999999995
actually they would risk their life they

6314.88 --> 6320.32
would literally knowingly do that

6317.52 --> 6323.679
and that's probably why you're even here

6320.32 --> 6325.28
so you're not gonna do that

6323.679 --> 6328.719
what

6325.28 --> 6331.5199999999995
all the the actual life energy

6328.719 --> 6333.679
that is amounted to you being here is it

6331.52 --> 6338.679
all just ripped away there's nothing

6333.679 --> 6338.679
left but death and hell now

6347.36 --> 6352.719
yeah that's so super super nice jaja

6350.159 --> 6357.239
light so nice words

6352.719 --> 6357.2390000000005
yeah how are you gonna pay for that pen

6358.0 --> 6361.119
are you going to get the paper

6362.4 --> 6366.4
where are you going to get the wax for

6364.239 --> 6368.32
the candles you're going to need to even

6366.4 --> 6370.5599999999995
write it at night

6368.32 --> 6375.799999999999
where are you going to get it

6370.56 --> 6375.8
it's all gone dude it's all gone

6410.56 --> 6413.56
okay

6427.84 --> 6429.92
you

6450.4 --> 6454.719
this is just a mentality oh what yeah

6452.56 --> 6459.4400000000005
yeah like you're saying like no no man

6454.719 --> 6462.4
don't worry man just lay down and die

6459.44 --> 6464.96
it'll be okay man i mean life is not

6462.4 --> 6466.879999999999
everything we have a life after that or

6464.96 --> 6469.92
something allegedly

6466.88 --> 6472.400000000001
i mean it's just life just do chill man

6469.92 --> 6474.4
just lay down and die man

6472.4 --> 6475.759999999999
it'll be alright

6474.4 --> 6477.92
i mean

6475.76 --> 6480.719
yeah if you don't want to see everything

6477.92 --> 6482.4800000000005
wither away and starve to death and just

6480.719 --> 6485.28
everything you love wither and die

6482.48 --> 6486.879999999999
including plants and animals and

6485.28 --> 6488.48
yeah if you don't want to see them just

6486.88 --> 6490.88
just kill yourself and it'll be all

6488.48 --> 6493.759999999999
right just just let it go

6490.88 --> 6495.679
just let life go man

6493.76 --> 6496.639
it'll be alright

6495.679 --> 6498.4
chill

6496.639 --> 6500.400000000001
why get so upset why

6498.4 --> 6502.799999999999
why this violence i mean you could just

6500.4 --> 6504.159
lay down and die

6502.8 --> 6506.56
it's okay

6504.159 --> 6506.5599999999995
yeah

6506.8 --> 6510.320000000001
i mean yeah we know the earth is not a

6508.8 --> 6512.320000000001
ball so it's okay you could just lay

6510.32 --> 6515.04
down and die now it's okay you don't

6512.32 --> 6517.36
have to worry so much

6515.04 --> 6518.6
yeah

6517.36 --> 6522.599999999999
is that your

6518.6 --> 6522.6
solution like

6527.119 --> 6531.92
where do we go from here uh

6529.76 --> 6534.320000000001
nowhere you die

6531.92 --> 6536.4800000000005
that's where you go from there

6534.32 --> 6538.159
because

6536.48 --> 6540.4
this keeps going

6538.159 --> 6542.5599999999995
there will be no more internet yet there

6540.4 --> 6543.679
will be no more show the power will be

6542.56 --> 6547.280000000001
turned off

6543.679 --> 6549.679
and then the water will be turned off

6547.28 --> 6552.08
and then there's no more food

6549.679 --> 6553.679
and then everybody dies

6552.08 --> 6555.36
and you will not even hear about it

6553.679 --> 6558.0
because there's no more internet

6555.36 --> 6561.04
activity because it's been shut off

6558.0 --> 6561.04
and everybody's dead

6565.44 --> 6570.48
because the possibilities are endless

6568.08 --> 6572.88
after death

6570.48 --> 6572.879999999999
yes

6574.88 --> 6580.0
everybody does yes

6577.76 --> 6582.4800000000005
so yeah so your solution is then just

6580.0 --> 6584.159
lay down and die then

6582.48 --> 6586.08
just

6584.159 --> 6587.5199999999995
just yeah just let it all happen just

6586.08 --> 6588.96
die

6587.52 --> 6591.52
sure

6588.96 --> 6593.36
that's your solution

6591.52 --> 6596.360000000001
i don't want to be part of your solution

6593.36 --> 6596.36
then

6612.88 --> 6618.719
thanks for your chanting that's great

6615.599 --> 6621.76
you go prepare for death then yeah go

6618.719 --> 6623.679
pray while you starve to death

6621.76 --> 6624.400000000001
just do that then okay

6623.679 --> 6626.719
light

6624.4 --> 6630.4
leave me out of it

6626.719 --> 6630.4
you go prepare for your death

6630.88 --> 6638.52
i'm gonna prepare to [ __ ] the people

6633.679 --> 6638.52
that are part of creating this up

6661.599 --> 6666.639
yeah no one complied with the tyrants in

6663.36 --> 6669.839999999999
control we they'd have no power yeah but

6666.639 --> 6672.08
they have no incentive to do that

6669.84 --> 6673.1990000000005
they need to feel what happens when you

6672.08 --> 6674.719
do that

6673.199 --> 6678.638999999999
they need to see

6674.719 --> 6680.719
blood spraying out of their kind

6678.639 --> 6681.599
they need to see that they need to see

6680.719 --> 6684.4
oh

6681.599 --> 6685.28
they're actually getting killed now

6684.4 --> 6688.638999999999
yeah

6685.28 --> 6692.719
because that's incentive like

6688.639 --> 6695.119
maybe we shouldn't just do what they say

6692.719 --> 6699.04
yeah it's called incentive you have to

6695.119 --> 6699.04
kill a couple of them for that

6700.08 --> 6705.599
in a very public setting

6702.56 --> 6708.88
so that everybody can see it as in plain

6705.599 --> 6710.88
sight daylight in a public place

6708.88 --> 6713.36
you drag them out and then you cut their

6710.88 --> 6717.4400000000005
[ __ ] head off and then you hold it up

6713.36 --> 6717.44
before you put it on the spike fence

6723.599 --> 6728.159000000001
and then yeah yeah then people will be

6726.32 --> 6729.679
less

6728.159 --> 6734.04
inclined

6729.679 --> 6734.04
to go along with them

6739.28 --> 6742.28
ugh

6750.56 --> 6752.96
all right

6762.08 --> 6768.5599999999995
time for fed no steaming traveler

6764.0 --> 6768.56
nathan's uh not having a live show today

6769.04 --> 6773.28
he's been having some plumbing issues

6771.119 --> 6773.28
and

6774.239 --> 6779.08
he didn't have

6775.599 --> 6779.08
his full attention

6779.199 --> 6782.08
for a live show

6790.32 --> 6796.639
in front of a war tank

6792.88 --> 6799.36
what war tank it's not war tanks that's

6796.639 --> 6799.36
ridiculous

6805.84 --> 6812.56
this is not a nation versus nation war

6808.56 --> 6815.84
this is the public versus the government

6812.56 --> 6819.2390000000005
this is not a tank war very ridiculous

6815.84 --> 6819.2390000000005
thing to say

6835.44 --> 6839.598999999999
okay thanks nathan i'm glad you

6837.28 --> 6842.08
appreciated it

6839.599 --> 6843.679
i'm a little pissed off but also because

6842.08 --> 6846.4
yeah

6843.679 --> 6848.4800000000005
my financial situation just got real

6846.4 --> 6850.0
worse a lot

6848.48 --> 6851.678999999999
and i don't know

6850.0 --> 6853.679
how i'm going to get around this i mean

6851.679 --> 6854.4800000000005
i am going to build up debt because of

6853.679 --> 6856.08
this

6854.48 --> 6858.08
there's going to be certain bills that

6856.08 --> 6862.32
i'm now going to persistently not pay

6858.08 --> 6864.159
just to be able to survive this

6862.32 --> 6867.28
right because i'm not expecting all of

6864.159 --> 6870.159
you guys to suddenly be able to just put

6867.28 --> 6872.159
in an extra 60 euros a month

6870.159 --> 6874.239
i don't expect you to be able to do that

6872.159 --> 6876.96
all of a sudden

6874.239 --> 6879.119
i mean i could already barely get around

6876.96 --> 6881.44
with all the support which has by the

6879.119 --> 6884.799999999999
way been fantastic and more than i

6881.44 --> 6884.799999999999
sometimes think i deserve

6887.599 --> 6891.159000000001
but i need it

6893.76 --> 6896.0
or

6896.159 --> 6900.719
i need that or i need the country my

6899.28 --> 6902.8
country to just

6900.719 --> 6905.119
permanently resolve this

6902.8 --> 6907.76
and i mean hurry the [ __ ] up or i am

6905.119 --> 6909.92
probably gonna end up

6907.76 --> 6911.679
moving in

6909.92 --> 6914.08
and then you'll probably never see me

6911.679 --> 6916.4800000000005
again except on the news

6914.08 --> 6921.92
because i am so [ __ ] done with this

6916.48 --> 6921.919999999999
like i i it's excruciating

6922.0 --> 6926.56
i spend most of my energy really i have

6924.719 --> 6928.2390000000005
a lot of it i spend most of my energy

6926.56 --> 6930.88
just not

6928.239 --> 6934.48
going insane from everything that's

6930.88 --> 6937.04
happening with my empathy i pick up all

6934.48 --> 6940.638999999999
do you realize that i pick up

6937.04 --> 6942.56
everybody else's feelings

6940.639 --> 6944.56
that are also

6942.56 --> 6946.639
entering this

6944.56 --> 6949.119000000001
so it's not just me that has to deal

6946.639 --> 6952.2390000000005
with oh [ __ ] my world is suddenly [ __ ]

6949.119 --> 6953.679
no i'm feeling that in thousands of

6952.239 --> 6956.08
people

6953.679 --> 6958.08
around me

6956.08 --> 6961.44
i've been feeling it for a while it

6958.08 --> 6963.599
really really sucks

6961.44 --> 6966.4
the only reason i have probably killed

6963.599 --> 6968.96
myself is because i swore

6966.4 --> 6971.598999999999
i will kill somebody else before i

6968.96 --> 6973.679
finish myself

6971.599 --> 6976.400000000001
and it will be somebody that really

6973.679 --> 6976.4
deserves it

6979.599 --> 6985.92
because it's [ __ ] excruciating to be

6982.239 --> 6985.919999999999
an empath in this world

6987.679 --> 6993.679
and i'm surprised that i can even

6989.76 --> 6993.679
protect myself sufficiently

6994.239 --> 6999.199
that i've gotten stronger

6996.639 --> 7002.87
than say 10 years ago when i had more

6999.199 --> 7006.62
energy but had more problems

7002.87 --> 7006.62
[Music]

7012.72 --> 7016.189
[Music]

7018.8 --> 7022.719
now go [ __ ] you

7020.96 --> 7025.04
you don't need to tell me to do that

7022.719 --> 7027.199
i'll do it when i do it

7025.04 --> 7029.44
and if i'm gonna do it i'm not doing it

7027.199 --> 7032.0
alone i'm not just gonna walk

7029.44 --> 7034.0
on my own with a knife or something to

7032.0 --> 7036.08
do anything no if i'm gonna go somewhere

7034.0 --> 7038.4
i'm gonna be surrounded by at least 10

7036.08 --> 7038.4
guys

7043.04 --> 7048.08
i'm not going to do it alone i just know

7044.8 --> 7049.92
i'm not because then it's

7048.08 --> 7052.48
who or what's going to vouch for me

7049.92 --> 7056.76
nobody will even know

7052.48 --> 7056.759999999999
like why i'm doing it then

7060.8 --> 7064.96
and by the way this is all ridiculous

7062.88 --> 7065.76
like why the [ __ ] would i need to do

7064.96 --> 7068.2390000000005
that

7065.76 --> 7070.96
when there's literally people that are

7068.239 --> 7073.119
military that should be able to do that

7070.96 --> 7075.36
do the are they just

7073.119 --> 7078.159
traitors

7075.36 --> 7082.5599999999995
they know everything here is getting

7078.159 --> 7085.04
destroyed now they know that's happening

7082.56 --> 7088.159000000001
they know that the places they lived are

7085.04 --> 7089.679
withering now and everybody's going bust

7088.159 --> 7092.08
and things are

7089.679 --> 7094.8
thrown away because it can't be paid for

7092.08 --> 7096.719
anymore that sort of [ __ ] people they

7094.8 --> 7099.679
should know the military should know i

7096.719 --> 7101.92
do not understand why the military has

7099.679 --> 7105.52
not done a coup

7101.92 --> 7107.92
on these communist pieces of [ __ ]

7105.52 --> 7110.719
i do not understand why they're just not

7107.92 --> 7114.52
doing anything i don't get it i don't

7110.719 --> 7114.52
[ __ ] get it

7125.599 --> 7130.08
the us

7127.04 --> 7130.08
the [ __ ] dude

7134.719 --> 7141.119
no no i just want this country to be

7138.239 --> 7143.919999999999
fixed i've lived here all my life i want

7141.119 --> 7148.839999999999
it to be fixed moving away to another

7143.92 --> 7148.84
country is not gonna make it go away

7158.08 --> 7161.599
like the police they just follow orders

7159.76 --> 7163.599
no but they don't

7161.599 --> 7165.84
and they shouldn't

7163.599 --> 7168.84
the police here doesn't just follow

7165.84 --> 7168.84
orders

7171.28 --> 7176.08
that's not how that works i mean that

7173.599 --> 7178.8
might be the way it works in england

7176.08 --> 7181.76
where the the format for policing is

7178.8 --> 7185.4400000000005
just completely different the protocols

7181.76 --> 7186.8
the training it's completely different

7185.44 --> 7189.28
it doesn't work like that in the

7186.8 --> 7189.28
netherlands

7191.28 --> 7195.5199999999995
i mean as police here you're kind of

7192.96 --> 7197.52
snowed under a bunch of rules

7195.52 --> 7200.4800000000005
like protocol rules have a lot of

7197.52 --> 7201.4400000000005
protocols it's very annoying really

7200.48 --> 7204.0
but

7201.44 --> 7207.96
you don't just follow orders that's not

7204.0 --> 7207.96
how it works at all

7221.76 --> 7225.719
[ __ ] are you whining about

7226.159 --> 7231.28
fight pretend you don't know what the

7228.08 --> 7234.08
[ __ ] i've done dude you ass i'm not

7231.28 --> 7236.32
gonna tell you i'm not gonna share you

7234.08 --> 7238.4
freaking potentially criminal [ __ ] that

7236.32 --> 7241.4
i've done and witnessed in the past you

7238.4 --> 7241.4
[ __ ]

7242.88 --> 7247.639
oh yes let me bring out all these

7244.88 --> 7250.32
examples of things i've done in order to

7247.639 --> 7251.599
legitimize that i'm calling for this

7250.32 --> 7255.48
[ __ ]

7251.599 --> 7255.4800000000005
are you [ __ ] [ __ ]

7262.8 --> 7270.96
besides i am not a fighter type

7268.239 --> 7273.678999999999
i'm not a big guy i'm not overly

7270.96 --> 7273.679
muscular

7278.159 --> 7285.679
i don't even like fighting i hate it

7282.96 --> 7287.04
i just want these [ __ ] to die

7285.679 --> 7290.159
that's all

7287.04 --> 7290.159
just want them dead

7292.0 --> 7297.199
i want that breed dead that entire way

7295.199 --> 7299.919999999999
of doing things

7297.199 --> 7302.919999999999
that form of politician must become

7299.92 --> 7302.92
extinct

7308.45 --> 7312.0289999999995
[Music]

7318.639 --> 7322.96
and i also think that everybody

7321.52 --> 7326.080000000001
involved

7322.96 --> 7329.04
in the wef agenda that is actually

7326.08 --> 7331.76
executing that agenda not just having

7329.04 --> 7333.44
visited once but that is actually in

7331.76 --> 7335.280000000001
governments

7333.44 --> 7336.839999999999
implementing it i think they should all

7335.28 --> 7338.5599999999995
be rounded up and

7336.84 --> 7340.400000000001
executed

7338.56 --> 7342.8
in a big trial

7340.4 --> 7345.598999999999
separate even from coving

7342.8 --> 7348.400000000001
because that's its own nurenberg trial

7345.599 --> 7349.92
[ __ ] right there

7348.4 --> 7352.0
but yeah

7349.92 --> 7353.92
now comes the thing who's gonna do that

7352.0 --> 7357.679
who's actually gonna be executing it

7353.92 --> 7357.679
when all the main parties

7357.76 --> 7363.4400000000005
that originally even were part of like

7360.719 --> 7365.28
trial situations like that are now the

7363.44 --> 7367.36
ones doing it

7365.28 --> 7369.679
who's going to do it who's going to do

7367.36 --> 7372.239
these trials who's going to actually

7369.679 --> 7375.28
be part of the military force

7372.239 --> 7375.28
to finish this

7375.52 --> 7379.92
because you can only come so far with

7377.52 --> 7382.639
like a civil revolt yeah you can execute

7379.92 --> 7384.32
politicians but then what

7382.639 --> 7386.2390000000005
right

7384.32 --> 7389.239
that's not the end of it that's just the

7386.239 --> 7389.239
beginning

7411.28 --> 7417.759999999999
dude charger light this is all really

7413.52 --> 7417.76
nice and all but it doesn't work

7421.76 --> 7424.400000000001
that's like

7422.8 --> 7427.4400000000005
look

7424.4 --> 7429.92
what you're saying now is like telling

7427.44 --> 7432.799999999999
your friend who just found out that his

7429.92 --> 7434.32
wife cheated on him

7432.8 --> 7436.159000000001
to tell them dude

7434.32 --> 7438.799999999999
don't worry just think about that

7436.159 --> 7440.879999999999
awesome vacation you had man just think

7438.8 --> 7444.92
about how great that was yeah that

7440.88 --> 7444.92
doesn't [ __ ] work

7454.239 --> 7457.239
so

7470.56 --> 7474.719
we have amish here in missouri

7472.8 --> 7476.400000000001
yeah but you also have a [ __ ] load of

7474.719 --> 7479.119
mosquitoes there

7476.4 --> 7481.759999999999
and it's all like broody weather i don't

7479.119 --> 7484.159
like it i would not like it in missouri

7481.76 --> 7484.159000000001
at all

7484.4 --> 7489.0
you have terrible insects there

7492.639 --> 7496.4800000000005
how is there an energy shortage there

7494.48 --> 7497.5199999999995
it's very simple they turn off all the

7496.48 --> 7499.919999999999
power

7497.52 --> 7504.56
covered in windmills windmills don't do

7499.92 --> 7504.56
[ __ ] dude they're completely useless

7505.76 --> 7510.320000000001
they don't do anything

7508.159 --> 7513.759999999999
they only like work half of the time

7510.32 --> 7513.759999999999
it's completely pointless

7517.28 --> 7521.5199999999995
right the problem is is that all cut

7519.36 --> 7524.239
levels of power plants in europe have

7521.52 --> 7527.76
been turned off for supposed climate

7524.239 --> 7530.239
change reasons a direct sabotage a siege

7527.76 --> 7533.04
of the people

7530.239 --> 7537.32
treachery

7533.04 --> 7537.32
death penalty worthy

7606.8 --> 7609.599
they are winning

7608.32 --> 7612.799999999999
why now

7609.599 --> 7614.159000000001
you have control over your life

7612.8 --> 7616.320000000001
i well

7614.159 --> 7619.92
everybody has some degree of control

7616.32 --> 7622.4
over their lives slaves have control

7619.92 --> 7624.96
over their lives prisoners

7622.4 --> 7627.36
have control over their lives

7624.96 --> 7630.639
everybody always has control over their

7627.36 --> 7633.04
lives to some extent

7630.639 --> 7636.159000000001
so that's completely pointless question

7633.04 --> 7636.159
there giada light

7638.48 --> 7641.119
yeah

7639.28 --> 7643.679
the amount of control i have over my

7641.119 --> 7644.639
life is really not as extensive as i

7643.679 --> 7646.4
well

7644.639 --> 7647.4400000000005
i would say as i would like

7646.4 --> 7651.5199999999995
it to be

7647.44 --> 7651.5199999999995
then again i was just never very good

7652.159 --> 7655.96
with that sort of thing

7681.76 --> 7685.04
yeah

7682.96 --> 7688.88
thanks for the tip dusty's

7685.04 --> 7692.96
look don't really care in this moment i

7688.88 --> 7692.96
don't even want to do that it's just i

7698.0 --> 7702.4
you do realize guys that i'm really

7700.239 --> 7705.839999999999
trying to avoid rage win as much as i

7702.4 --> 7709.239
can because it's it kind of sucks to me

7705.84 --> 7709.2390000000005
to do that

7733.76 --> 7739.1990000000005
yeah it's hard to tell steamy it look

7736.719 --> 7740.4
that is just a real [ __ ] of a

7739.199 --> 7744.36
question

7740.4 --> 7744.36
or to answer at least

7744.719 --> 7747.36
i mean

7745.599 --> 7750.32
i do

7747.36 --> 7752.719
always try to figure i mean i am always

7750.32 --> 7754.4
working on it on control over my life

7752.719 --> 7757.199
one way or another it's just the typical

7754.4 --> 7760.239
paths that i choose within that

7757.199 --> 7763.678999999999
tend to be very narrow

7760.239 --> 7765.839999999999
it's like i don't have a lot of options

7763.679 --> 7769.599
because of the way that i do things and

7765.84 --> 7772.719
that i am with which is critical for the

7769.599 --> 7774.719
functioning of my spirit the way it is

7772.719 --> 7779.199
i just don't have a lot of maneuvering

7774.719 --> 7779.199
room really as a person i really don't

7783.28 --> 7787.679
i mean even if i suddenly got loaded

7785.76 --> 7790.159000000001
with money for some reason and i'm not

7787.679 --> 7790.159
going to

7791.679 --> 7796.159
even then i would not even get all that

7794.159 --> 7798.0
much more control over my life i'm not

7796.159 --> 7798.879999999999
joking

7798.0 --> 7802.239
it's

7798.88 --> 7804.2390000000005
the way i am is narrow i don't have

7802.239 --> 7806.959999999999
maneuvering room

7804.239 --> 7809.28
i just don't

7806.96 --> 7811.44
because if i did that then i wouldn't be

7809.28 --> 7814.079
the way that i am anymore

7811.44 --> 7817.678999999999
i would not be able to do what i do i

7814.079 --> 7819.679
would not be able to proudly

7817.679 --> 7822.56
uphold purity

7819.679 --> 7824.96
the way that i do i would not be able to

7822.56 --> 7829.0
i would become too ashamed

7824.96 --> 7829.0
to even go there

7829.679 --> 7835.079
[ __ ] off your [ __ ] little piece of

7832.079 --> 7835.079
[ __ ]

7865.44 --> 7870.719
pretty nice and still slow mode on

7867.84 --> 7874.119000000001
because otherwise my chats just gonna be

7870.719 --> 7874.119
snowed under

7904.239 --> 7910.879999999999
hence christian andersen type

7907.119 --> 7914.0
oh you mean just regular males

7910.88 --> 7914.0
would woodworking gunny bear

7918.0 --> 7923.52
so not the modern

7920.239 --> 7923.5199999999995
electric windmills

7924.159 --> 7927.159
goody

7954.8 --> 7957.8
okay

7988.159 --> 7992.159
dude

7989.92 --> 7996.2390000000005
what the [ __ ] are you whining about your

7992.159 --> 7998.48
graveler little piece of [ __ ]

7996.239 --> 8000.799999999999
what the [ __ ] are you whining about my

7998.48 --> 8004.4
slow mode

8000.8 --> 8006.88
yeah i have that for a reason

8004.4 --> 8009.199
the reason is that if i don't suddenly

8006.88 --> 8012.079
my chat's going to be all filled up in

8009.199 --> 8013.919999999999
moments that i really don't need it

8012.079 --> 8015.92
yeah

8013.92 --> 8018.4800000000005
it's not because oh it's too many

8015.92 --> 8021.1990000000005
messages no it's because

8018.48 --> 8023.598999999999
i get a little intense here and there

8021.199 --> 8026.079
and then people all suddenly all at once

8023.599 --> 8027.679
wants to ram out their piece of text all

8026.079 --> 8030.0
in the same second

8027.679 --> 8033.76
that [ __ ] happened all the time

8030.0 --> 8033.76
that's why there's a slow mode

8033.92 --> 8037.04
i talked to my healer

8035.679 --> 8038.88
lately

8037.04 --> 8041.36
i did try to call him this morning when

8038.88 --> 8043.84
he's not picking up i think he's like

8041.36 --> 8045.36
being a bit overwhelmed

8043.84 --> 8047.28
right now

8045.36 --> 8048.96
because yeah well blatantly obvious

8047.28 --> 8051.04
reasons i mean i'm not going to be the

8048.96 --> 8053.199
only one that's going to be like

8051.04 --> 8055.36
have feel like they're like after life

8053.199 --> 8057.919999999999
is falling apart because of this

8055.36 --> 8060.92
energy crisis [ __ ]

8057.92 --> 8060.92
so

8071.84 --> 8075.92
okay he would work in guinea bear yeah

8074.079 --> 8080.28
now the thing is i'm not gonna move

8075.92 --> 8080.28
anywhere it's that simple

8084.56 --> 8090.88
look

8086.239 --> 8093.36
maybe one day i'll get over there and

8090.88 --> 8096.0
i don't know join up you guys or visit

8093.36 --> 8096.96
somebody who knows i mean i'm not really

8096.0 --> 8099.04
the guy

8096.96 --> 8100.0
not a very big traveling guy and all

8099.04 --> 8101.92
that

8100.0 --> 8107.8
but maybe i'll do that but i'm not just

8101.92 --> 8107.8
gonna move moving is not a solution

8108.239 --> 8112.879999999999
it comes like with full reimbursement of

8110.88 --> 8114.719
all the costs which is not gonna happen

8112.88 --> 8118.679
because why

8114.719 --> 8118.679
makes no freaking sense

8135.679 --> 8141.04
okay kingston or gurgle

8139.119 --> 8143.92

8158.0 --> 8165.4

dutch word either

i mean how can you even make like 20

8350.16 --> 8354.719
comments in a row exclusively about

8352.719 --> 8357.358999999999
whining how your chat or your comments

8354.719 --> 8360.678999999998

foreign

8402.08 --> 8405.76
[ __ ] sake

8403.52 --> 8405.76
just

8414.16 --> 8418.88
oh

8417.04 --> 8421.6

8418.88 --> 8421.599999999999
portraitures

8427.28 --> 8430.0
okay

8428.319 --> 8431.6
that looks exactly like what we would

8430.0 --> 8433.68
call poverty

8431.6 --> 8437.08
although those aren't balls those are a

8433.68 --> 8437.08
bit more flat

8446.479 --> 8450.24
yeah the e

8447.6 --> 8451.6
yeah it's that's the ether

8450.24 --> 8452.56
the ae

8451.6 --> 8455.12
i know

8452.56 --> 8457.199999999999
yeah that's exclusively scandinavian we

8455.12 --> 8460.0
don't use that

8457.2 --> 8462.880000000001
in in the netherlands

8460.0 --> 8462.88
so that's like a

8462.96 --> 8469.16
danish norwegian swedish finnish thing

8476.08 --> 8479.56
come on susie

8491.12 --> 8499.12

i just

8500.88 --> 8507.119999999999
had to blow a gasket man

8504.56 --> 8508.88
but seriously i've been like very

8507.12 --> 8511.04
miserable this night because of that

8508.88 --> 8514.96
[ __ ]

8511.04 --> 8517.439
i mean this could potentially be another

8514.96 --> 8520.56
issue where i'm gonna have like a fight

8517.439 --> 8523.68
with my landlord oh my god i'm so

8520.56 --> 8525.199999999999
looking forward to that again

8523.68 --> 8527.84
goody

8525.2 --> 8531.08
and yes i'm being sarcastic i hope

8527.84 --> 8531.08
you're noticing

8549.359 --> 8555.960000000001
yeah let's get rid of constance

8552.96 --> 8555.96
no

8565.92 --> 8572.479
60 per month no no no no george sanford

8568.96 --> 8574.56
60 extra a month

8572.479 --> 8575.76
that's now going to add up to

8574.56 --> 8577.279999999999
is it

8575.76 --> 8578.479
200

8577.28 --> 8580.319000000001
a month

8578.479 --> 8583.76
just on utilities

8580.319 --> 8587.92
that's literally half the rent

8583.76 --> 8587.92
no wait that's more than half the rent

8593.28 --> 8598.08
it's not cheap utility

8595.52 --> 8599.84
no it's not it's for one little [ __ ]

8598.08 --> 8601.68
little room dude

8599.84 --> 8604.479
that's insane

8601.68 --> 8605.6
it's more than half the entire rent

8604.479 --> 8608.08
price

8605.6 --> 8612.6
and it's already expensive

8608.08 --> 8612.6
are you out of your [ __ ] mind dude

8613.68 --> 8616.68
so

8653.12 --> 8658.240000000002
anyway look if you want to help this guy

8656.0 --> 8658.24
out

8659.6 --> 8664.0
donate to my paypal i really need it

8664.64 --> 8669.039999999999
already got a couple and i really

8666.0 --> 8670.64
appreciate that but yeah that's

8669.04 --> 8672.0
basically

8670.64 --> 8675.68
a bit of a

8672.0 --> 8675.68
drop on a hot plate to be fair

8676.0 --> 8677.84
i'm

8676.96 --> 8681.72
yeah

8677.84 --> 8681.72
but you know how that works

8688.16 --> 8691.039999999999
when do the price increases go into

8689.92 --> 8694.68
effect

8691.04 --> 8694.68
end of this month

8707.28 --> 8710.28
sheesh

8720.8 --> 8725.84
wow well woodworking gummy bear that's

8723.04 --> 8728.880000000001
cool so your electric

8725.84 --> 8733.24
is the same as mine except

8728.88 --> 8733.24
i'm in a tiny little room

8740.0 --> 8743.359
do you even realize that

8750.96 --> 8755.438999999998
i tried thinking did you edit yeah it

8753.2 --> 8758.399000000001
was annoying isn't it the susie that's

8755.439 --> 8760.16
exactly why i do that

8758.399 --> 8762.16
because that guy

8760.16 --> 8764.08
is just

8762.16 --> 8767.08
ugh

8764.08 --> 8767.08
annoying

8769.68 --> 8775.28
and he does that always in his own show

8772.16 --> 8777.039999999999
he does that always he's like that

8775.28 --> 8780.560000000001
always

8777.04 --> 8783.04
hours and hours on end just that exactly

8780.56 --> 8783.039999999999
like that

8788.88 --> 8793.64
other than that good shot okay thanks

8799.68 --> 8803.76
yeah i'll definitely avoid

8801.76 --> 8805.84
getting him dragging on in my chat but

8803.76 --> 8808.08
at least he's not a guy that makes socks

8805.84 --> 8809.84
sock accounts and just keeps doing that

8808.08 --> 8811.76
or something

8809.84 --> 8814.64
i mean if he's banned he's bad and he

8811.76 --> 8817.52
knows he does at least respect that

8814.64 --> 8819.439
you know that's the thing about him he's

8817.52 --> 8821.92
not like the worst of the worst

8819.439 --> 8824.319
character out there but he is like

8821.92 --> 8826.319
definitely classified in my book as an

8824.319 --> 8827.92
anti-flat earther

8826.319 --> 8831.439
right

8827.92 --> 8834.8
that doesn't mean but more like a

8831.439 --> 8836.800000000001
akuma virus anti-flat earther and less

8834.8 --> 8838.96
like a

8836.8 --> 8840.319
fight to flat earth type of anti-flat

8838.96 --> 8843.199999999999
earther right

8840.319 --> 8843.199999999999
big difference

8844.72 --> 8847.88
all right

8864.72 --> 8868.399
wood stove propane oh cool

8876.8 --> 8881.519999999999
okay interesting sounds interesting

8878.399 --> 8881.519999999999
woodworking gunny bear

8882.08 --> 8885.28
i'm glad

8883.359 --> 8886.720000000001
your setup is working out for you i mean

8885.28 --> 8888.08
this setup

8886.72 --> 8891.279999999999
it is

8888.08 --> 8895.039999999999
a bit expensive it is kind of urban

8891.28 --> 8896.880000000001
but it has been working for me

8895.04 --> 8899.04
yeah but it's not gonna work for me if

8896.88 --> 8902.16
just the price

8899.04 --> 8904.640000000001
so out of control unless unless you guys

8902.16 --> 8908.96
are actually providing for me but the

8904.64 --> 8908.96
dependency factor then is growing

8909.04 --> 8911.439
i mean

8911.92 --> 8918.56
i'm gonna be more dependent on you guys

8915.12 --> 8920.800000000001
to be able to do this

8918.56 --> 8923.119999999999
this show on the internet using

8920.8 --> 8926.16
electricity which is literally leaning

8923.12 --> 8928.08
on the thing that is just now exploding

8926.16 --> 8932.84
in price

8928.08 --> 8935.12
so this is kind of a risky situation for

8932.84 --> 8936.64
me because what the [ __ ] would even

8935.12 --> 8939.2
happen if i certainly couldn't do the

8936.64 --> 8943.08
show anymore i can't even imagine what

8939.2 --> 8943.08
would happen at this point

8950.479 --> 8954.96
have coronaries what what do you mean

8958.72 --> 8963.84
you have a plan b no

8961.28 --> 8963.84
no i don't

8966.479 --> 8970.64
plan b is

8967.92 --> 8973.2
basically lay down everything lay down

8970.64 --> 8974.96
this attitude lay down my intellect lay

8973.2 --> 8977.68
down everything

8974.96 --> 8980.72
roll into the whatever [ __ ] system is

8977.68 --> 8982.319
left and just hope i don't get forced to

8980.72 --> 8984.399
poison myself

8982.319 --> 8987.88
in order to survive

8984.399 --> 8987.88
that's the alternative

8995.28 --> 8998.800000000001
yeah it's not much of an alternative

8997.28 --> 9000.880000000001
it's not an alternative that can

8998.8 --> 9002.8
continue building

9000.88 --> 9007.119999999999
what i've been doing here yeah i don't

9002.8 --> 9009.519999999999
have an alternative to continuate that

9007.12 --> 9013.08
without this show without doing what i

9009.52 --> 9013.08
do here yeah

9018.479 --> 9022.16
government officials have heart attacks

9027.6 --> 9030.08
okay

9031.52 --> 9034.479000000001
that would be cute

9041.76 --> 9044.960000000001
i mean yeah

9043.28 --> 9048.560000000001
look guys

9044.96 --> 9050.8
if the powers that be if that even is

9048.56 --> 9052.8
what it is anymore

9050.8 --> 9054.8
there is a way to yeah get them out of

9052.8 --> 9059.358999999999
the way and then like

9054.8 --> 9062.72
two the cia allegedly declassified heart

9059.359 --> 9064.0
attack guns like in the 70s

9062.72 --> 9065.438999999998
so

9064.0 --> 9068.399
yeah

9065.439 --> 9071.76
i mean if it was decided by those that

9068.399 --> 9074.24
have that tech and have

9071.76 --> 9075.76
the connections in order to get away

9074.24 --> 9077.76
with that somehow

9075.76 --> 9079.92
yeah they could just like

9077.76 --> 9082.08
just go up to their houses and just in

9079.92 --> 9085.28
the night just like

9082.08 --> 9089.84
they get a heart attack they die

9085.28 --> 9089.84
yeah that they could do that yeah i mean

9094.0 --> 9099.52
as long as it stops

9096.64 --> 9102.16
as long as this [ __ ] ends and we can

9099.52 --> 9104.08
sort of get back to a position where we

9102.16 --> 9105.84
could at least try to keep things

9104.08 --> 9109.92
together here

9105.84 --> 9109.92
yeah sure do that then fine

9112.8 --> 9117.519999999999
just get him out of the way

9115.68 --> 9120.24
just do it

9117.52 --> 9123.04
i don't i don't care anymore how just

9120.24 --> 9126.72
get them out of the way

9123.04 --> 9128.960000000001
get this format of governing out of the

9126.72 --> 9131.84
way get them out make sure they never

9128.96 --> 9131.839999999998
get back in

9134.64 --> 9139.279999999999
also i would like to introduce not that

9137.28 --> 9140.960000000001
everybody's going to take my word for

9139.28 --> 9142.800000000001
that or anything or

9140.96 --> 9146.0
or take a hint

9142.8 --> 9150.399
i would just like some new revolutionary

9146.0 --> 9154.8
potentially future international policy

9150.399 --> 9154.8
that would say that if as a politician

9155.359 --> 9160.960000000001
you fail on your promises

9157.6 --> 9162.880000000001
that you can become liable for the death

9160.96 --> 9163.839999999998
penalty

9162.88 --> 9166.72
if

9163.84 --> 9168.960000000001
if that actually causes direct calamity

9166.72 --> 9171.039999999999
because of your false promises i think

9168.96 --> 9175.199999999999
that should become a thing

9171.04 --> 9178.0
a very very serious thing

9175.2 --> 9181.76
like a rule that should literally be

9178.0 --> 9181.76
etched into stone

9181.92 --> 9187.84
as in you cannot undo that

9185.2 --> 9190.960000000001
if as a politician you come in

9187.84 --> 9193.359
you make completely false promises that

9190.96 --> 9195.679999999998
you could technically at least attempt

9193.359 --> 9197.439
to do and then you just don't do it you

9195.68 --> 9199.359
lied about it and you do something

9197.439 --> 9200.64
completely the opposite

9199.359 --> 9201.68
that you become

9200.64 --> 9205.119999999999
liable

9201.68 --> 9205.12
for the death penalty

9206.399 --> 9211.358999999999
that would be

9208.16 --> 9213.359
something else that would be a big game

9211.359 --> 9216.56
changer

9213.359 --> 9218.640000000001
because it's really just this unlimited

9216.56 --> 9220.16
unrestrained power

9218.64 --> 9223.279999999999
of being able to get away with

9220.16 --> 9227.039999999999
everything that's allowed this political

9223.28 --> 9229.12
demonic spirit to metastasize everywhere

9227.04 --> 9231.359
it's because they could just get away

9229.12 --> 9233.2
with it and nothing happened

9231.359 --> 9235.2
they didn't get a fine they didn't get

9233.2 --> 9237.52
fired they didn't get jail they didn't

9235.2 --> 9241.28
get anything they just got away with

9237.52 --> 9244.399000000001
everything for like a decade

9241.28 --> 9244.399000000001
that's the problem

9245.6 --> 9251.6
if you depend on the government to do

9248.8 --> 9254.599999999999
something about the government you're

9251.6 --> 9254.6
[ __ ]

9264.399 --> 9267.96
hey elise g

9271.76 --> 9275.76
no i cannot live with my dad for a short

9274.08 --> 9278.88
time and how the hell is that gonna fix

9275.76 --> 9282.960000000001
anything steamy traveler

9278.88 --> 9287.72
how the [ __ ] is that gonna fix anything

9282.96 --> 9287.72
it's not it's not gonna fix anything

9321.76 --> 9325.359
yeah at least g

9323.6 --> 9326.640000000001
system is outdated

9325.359 --> 9329.12
maybe

9326.64 --> 9330.319
yes there's there's a point to that but

9329.12 --> 9333.6
yeah there's already been

9330.319 --> 9336.319
experimentation with direct democracy

9333.6 --> 9339.6
that's like what iceland did 10 years

9336.319 --> 9342.72
ago it went great for a while until

9339.6 --> 9344.56
the globalists start leaking in and then

9342.72 --> 9346.88
turning it upside down and turning it

9344.56 --> 9348.0
into a liberal [ __ ] that it is right

9346.88 --> 9350.08
now

9348.0 --> 9353.6
yeah but they had

9350.08 --> 9354.64
direct democracy internet-based direct

9353.6 --> 9356.640000000001
voting

9354.64 --> 9360.16
where you could as every citizen could

9356.64 --> 9362.16
literally just make a vote on how to

9360.16 --> 9364.16
divide the budget

9362.16 --> 9366.08
for the government

9364.16 --> 9368.08
genius

9366.08 --> 9371.439
genius system

9368.08 --> 9372.479
it has its problems and pitfalls for

9371.439 --> 9376.319
sure

9372.479 --> 9376.319
but it's really stable

9376.64 --> 9380.88
and you don't have any [ __ ]

9378.399 --> 9383.68
politicians ruining everything for

9380.88 --> 9385.679999999998
everybody you don't have that then i

9383.68 --> 9388.479000000001
don't even understand like how they

9385.68 --> 9390.16
infiltrated back in

9388.479 --> 9391.84
i think they just created some fake

9390.16 --> 9393.52
crisis and then just took over or

9391.84 --> 9397.84
something

9393.52 --> 9397.84
i don't know exactly how that happened

9404.08 --> 9409.039999999999
switzerland has their mech democracy

9406.56 --> 9409.039999999999
they do

9409.6 --> 9416.12
one two three do they that's the first

9412.16 --> 9416.119999999999
time that i've heard of that

9439.76 --> 9445.28
no steamy traveler no

9442.24 --> 9445.28
that's not gonna work

9450.08 --> 9453.12
i mean

9451.12 --> 9455.12
their problems

9453.12 --> 9458.08
i mean other places in the netherlands

9455.12 --> 9461.68
are gonna undergo the same problems it's

9458.08 --> 9464.16
not gonna fix the situation trying to

9461.68 --> 9466.319
find a new place to live

9464.16 --> 9469.28
do you understand that that's not gonna

9466.319 --> 9473.199999999999
work because every place

9469.28 --> 9475.28
i will try to find will have the same

9473.2 --> 9478.399000000001
problems

9475.28 --> 9483.720000000001
you can't escape this

9478.399 --> 9483.72
the problem is gonna reoccur everywhere

9499.2 --> 9500.960000000001
right

9500.0 --> 9504.8
for

9500.96 --> 9506.24
oh yeah for the purposes

9504.8 --> 9507.279999999999
for intense

9506.24 --> 9508.8
intent

9507.28 --> 9511.12
and purposes

9508.8 --> 9513.679999999998
this is still the best place for me

9511.12 --> 9513.68
right now

9513.76 --> 9517.04
even though i don't have a garden

9520.72 --> 9524.399
but only as long as

9524.72 --> 9529.199999999999
well as the netherlands stay stable

9527.68 --> 9531.439
because well then

9529.2 --> 9534.84
dude if it's gonna get worse and worse

9531.439 --> 9538.960000000001
then literally like there's gonna be an

9534.84 --> 9538.960000000001
exodus and i don't know where

9539.359 --> 9543.84
or there's going to be just like bizarre

9542.0 --> 9545.6
financial calamity where literally

9543.84 --> 9547.92
everybody's just squatting like

9545.6 --> 9550.479000000001
everybody then will just end up

9547.92 --> 9554.319
squatting

9550.479 --> 9554.319
it's gonna be crazy chaos

9555.359 --> 9560.28
so moving is not an option

9599.359 --> 9603.76
right anyway i think i'm gonna round out

9600.96 --> 9608.399
the show it's been going very long

9603.76 --> 9610.0
it's probably my longest show to date

9608.399 --> 9614.399
or at least this year

9610.0 --> 9614.399
two hours 37 38 minutes

9615.04 --> 9623.479000000001
all right a no-live flat earth debate

9618.84 --> 9623.479
show oh there is a premiere

9635.439 --> 9638.0
jesus

9641.76 --> 9645.68
right so yeah

9643.6 --> 9647.12
four more hours

9645.68 --> 9649.279
[Music]

9647.12 --> 9650.880000000001
right now i i could technically stay on

9649.279 --> 9653.6
a little longer

9650.88 --> 9656.08
but uh yeah

9653.6 --> 9658.399000000001
because at least now i feel like just i

9656.08 --> 9661.68
got that [ __ ] out and like i'm not gonna

9658.399 --> 9661.68
blow up anymore at least

9662.88 --> 9668.08
guys for however

9665.439 --> 9670.08
cool that may seem or like inspiring or

9668.08 --> 9672.319
like yeah i feel like that too it it

9670.08 --> 9677.84
does suck

9672.319 --> 9677.84
it's pain it's pain that's driving that

9682.479 --> 9686.56
right but i think i got most of it out

9684.479 --> 9688.319
and

9686.56 --> 9690.64
at least i got an appointment tomorrow

9688.319 --> 9692.56
so i could talk about my

9690.64 --> 9694.399
social worker and all that and figure

9692.56 --> 9696.08
out like maybe i could get like a lawyer

9694.399 --> 9698.96
or something

9696.08 --> 9698.96
figure this out

9700.56 --> 9705.359
because this is not just our problem

9702.479 --> 9708.399
this is also the landlord's problem

9705.359 --> 9709.92
i mean i can't blame him he is getting

9708.399 --> 9711.76
that bill

9709.92 --> 9714.64
now he might be

9711.76 --> 9719.56
actually trying to exploit it a little

9714.64 --> 9719.56
but in a way i kind of doubt that he is

9720.08 --> 9724.88
i mean

9722.319 --> 9726.72
the price is going up that much seems to

9724.88 --> 9730.16
really be happening out there it's not a

9726.72 --> 9731.84
gravel it is actually going that insane

9730.16 --> 9733.439
so i think that it would be in

9731.84 --> 9734.319
everybody's best interest here if we

9733.439 --> 9736.880000000001
just

9734.319 --> 9738.399
would be able to deal with it without

9736.88 --> 9741.278999999999
getting into like a fight with the

9738.399 --> 9741.278999999999
landlord again

9741.439 --> 9745.880000000001
ugh

9742.88 --> 9745.88
anyway

9752.16 --> 9757.399
yeah yeah yeah that's a tough one

9764.24 --> 9769.68
yes yes pgcnet i know i know and i hate

9767.52 --> 9771.92
that i hate that

9769.68 --> 9774.56
they prob do but the way things are

9771.92 --> 9777.68
going like literally our welfare the

9774.56 --> 9779.76
basic welfare should be heightened

9777.68 --> 9782.479000000001
they haven't heightened it

9779.76 --> 9784.319
they gave us a money bonus

9782.479 --> 9786.72
and then inflation happened everything's

9784.319 --> 9788.72
more expensive yet they didn't actually

9786.72 --> 9791.119999999999
heighten the standard

9788.72 --> 9793.358999999999
welfare which is like the minimum you

9791.12 --> 9795.439
have like a

9793.359 --> 9797.439
constitutional right to that here in the

9795.439 --> 9799.04
netherlands it's funny it's in the

9797.439 --> 9802.56
constitution

9799.04 --> 9805.76
right i'm i'm gladly abusing that or

9802.56 --> 9808.0
using that matter of perspective

9805.76 --> 9808.0
but

9809.2 --> 9812.880000000001
they haven't heightened it and they

9810.56 --> 9814.64
probably should but the problem is with

9812.88 --> 9816.8
that on the long run it doesn't actually

9814.64 --> 9818.64
fix anything it's just

9816.8 --> 9820.56
throwing money at it

9818.64 --> 9822.08
at a growing problem

9820.56 --> 9823.68
and then eventually it's going to cost

9822.08 --> 9825.68
more money and more money and more money

9823.68 --> 9829.12
and then it's just going to be a massive

9825.68 --> 9829.12
implosion all of a sudden

9829.279 --> 9834.640000000001
it's going to trash the euro

9832.72 --> 9836.56
but we'll see how they fix it because

9834.64 --> 9838.16
yeah there will be people here in the

9836.56 --> 9840.96
netherlands that are on social welfare

9838.16 --> 9842.84
that are literally now just suddenly not

9840.96 --> 9845.759999999998
going to be able to pay their

9842.84 --> 9847.76
bills and they probably won't be as

9845.76 --> 9851.12
dynamic about it

9847.76 --> 9855.04
it will really be a disaster to them

9851.12 --> 9856.240000000002
and that could literally just mean

9855.04 --> 9859.84
well

9856.24 --> 9859.84
fights in the street and [ __ ]

9859.92 --> 9862.08
so

9862.479 --> 9866.8
yeah

9863.279 --> 9869.76
it's a bigger problem and look i

9866.8 --> 9869.759999999998
i try to just

9869.92 --> 9874.319
get the best oversight i can in order to

9872.479 --> 9876.8
figure out like what is the best course

9874.319 --> 9879.199999999999
of action even in an untenable situation

9876.8 --> 9881.84
which is what this seems like

9879.2 --> 9884.399000000001
right and i present my findings even if

9881.84 --> 9887.439
they go over every border that anybody

9884.399 --> 9889.278999999999
would like to go like hey maybe we

9887.439 --> 9892.399
should just [ __ ] them up

9889.279 --> 9895.2
since they are the direct cause of this

9892.399 --> 9898.0
through their specific policies they

9895.2 --> 9900.399000000001
have caused this crisis

9898.0 --> 9902.479
and it was told to them

9900.399 --> 9903.599999999999
if you do this this is what's gonna

9902.479 --> 9906.24
happen

9903.6 --> 9908.16
we're here now it's happened exactly as

9906.24 --> 9909.68
they were warned about and now they

9908.16 --> 9912.68
should pay

9909.68 --> 9912.68
barely

9919.68 --> 9922.64
right anyway

9924.8 --> 9930.64
i think i'm gonna run out unless there's

9928.0 --> 9934.399
does anybody got any questions

9930.64 --> 9934.399
[ __ ] of power for six hours

9935.2 --> 9941.240000000002
that's hilarious elegy

9937.68 --> 9941.24
hope you're doing good

9944.0 --> 9950.0
yeah they knew what they were doing and

9945.84 --> 9952.960000000001
they should pay for it big

9950.0 --> 9954.96
as in okay here's the bill

9952.96 --> 9957.199999999999
here's your possessions we're going to

9954.96 --> 9959.759999999998
confiscate all your possessions of all

9957.2 --> 9962.240000000002
these politicians everything

9959.76 --> 9964.800000000001
every bank account every house

9962.24 --> 9967.6
everything everything they have all

9964.8 --> 9970.88
their stocks everything everything all

9967.6 --> 9975.6
confiscated all of it

9970.88 --> 9978.72
so they have nothing absolutely nothing

9975.6 --> 9982.0
and then i don't know

9978.72 --> 9982.0
i don't know what to do with them

9982.72 --> 9985.84
banish them

9986.399 --> 9990.24
put them in jail

9988.56 --> 9994.24
give them the death penalty i don't know

9990.24 --> 9997.52
it depends per individual pretty much

9994.24 --> 10000.319
but i think that that would be a fitting

9997.52 --> 10001.84
a fitting way to go about

10000.319 --> 10005.039999999999
it all

10001.84 --> 10007.12
wasted giant amounts of money and like

10005.04 --> 10009.92
as their funky within their function

10007.12 --> 10011.279
they have used just insane amounts of

10009.92 --> 10013.92
money

10011.279 --> 10018.08
just for their basic convenience these

10013.92 --> 10020.24
people spend like their oligarchs

10018.08 --> 10022.96
these politicians that are doing this to

10020.24 --> 10026.72
us they're spending like oligarchs

10022.96 --> 10029.919999999998
and they should pay for that dearly

10026.72 --> 10029.92
dearly pay

10035.2 --> 10040.880000000001
it literally

10036.96 --> 10043.358999999999
thrusted our country into a financial

10040.88 --> 10046.399
abyss

10043.359 --> 10048.56
with their treachery

10046.399 --> 10053.96
treachery

10048.56 --> 10053.96
death penalty worthy treachery

10060.56 --> 10065.119999999999
400 000 shoe shining jobs what

10067.52 --> 10071.76
should flatten out the show instead of

10069.279 --> 10073.16
rounding out that's hilarious

10071.76 --> 10076.87
thank you for that

10073.16 --> 10076.869999999999
[Music]

10080.56 --> 10084.479
maybe i'll go on another 10 minutes

10082.56 --> 10087.96
anyway i'm gonna take a two minute break

10084.479 --> 10087.96
i'll be right back

10102.479 --> 10105.479
uh

10198.319 --> 10201.319
uh

10219.04 --> 10223.92
close to

10220.08 --> 10223.92
three hours yeah i know pgcnet

10225.359 --> 10230.479000000001
you're late but you're still here yeah

10227.04 --> 10230.479000000001
now it's good to have you legi

10230.64 --> 10235.599999999999
i mean the beginning of the show was not

10232.8 --> 10235.599999999999
that pleasant

10235.68 --> 10241.439
just a bunch of bickering with bev

10238.96 --> 10243.278999999999
troy thinking again

10241.439 --> 10245.279
kept yeah although it was kind of funny

10243.279 --> 10250.0
with nathan oakley and

10245.279 --> 10251.6
sleeping warrior going at him in my chat

10250.0 --> 10255.439
it's always like a mini event when

10251.6 --> 10257.84
nathan goes after somebody in my chat

10255.439 --> 10261.12
until i kicked him out because it just

10257.84 --> 10261.12
became too annoying

10261.359 --> 10266.880000000001
and then i rambled on about the dutch

10263.76 --> 10266.880000000001
energy calamity

10267.2 --> 10272.16
for the red yeah the last hour pretty

10269.279 --> 10272.16
much so

10276.24 --> 10282.039999999999
your cat is still sitting on your lap so

10278.319 --> 10282.039999999999
you got time okay

10311.92 --> 10316.12

10324.8 --> 10327.679999999998
i

10325.84 --> 10329.92
what

10327.68 --> 10332.720000000001
but how can you take a screenshot of it

10329.92 --> 10337.359
if it is in the comments there i mean if

10332.72 --> 10340.24
it it can't be in the the live chat or

10337.359 --> 10342.800000000001
the top chat and then not show up in the

10340.24 --> 10344.96
visual chat

10342.8 --> 10347.119999999999
on the screen that's literally

10344.96 --> 10349.839999999998
impossible

10347.12 --> 10353.279
there is no word filter in there it's

10349.84 --> 10357.04
directly taken from the code of the same

10353.279 --> 10357.04
chat box that you're in

10361.6 --> 10365.84
chad said no no there is no difference

10363.6 --> 10365.84
there

10370.479 --> 10375.76
i think

10372.64 --> 10378.0
anyway it's weird and dude the guy went

10375.76 --> 10380.880000000001
just whined about it for like 20

10378.0 --> 10382.8
messages straight i mean

10380.88 --> 10384.72
at some point just shouldn't care

10382.8 --> 10389.16
anymore

10384.72 --> 10389.16
like he never actually had a point

10418.08 --> 10420.72
oh man

10421.68 --> 10425.439
yeah i'm feeling a bit better at least

10431.2 --> 10436.640000000001
yes pgc net no look in in the actual

10434.0 --> 10439.04
chat that i'm watching on the youtube

10436.64 --> 10441.039999999999
video i've got it set to live chat as

well

10441.04 --> 10446.800000000001
but the code that i input in obs

10444.96 --> 10449.599999999999
with the chat

10446.8 --> 10450.8
function there

10449.6 --> 10454.399000000001

10454.72 --> 10461.519999999999
so it's literally in the word there

10458.479 --> 10463.679999999998
live underscore chat question mark

10461.52 --> 10467.279
is underscore pop out

10463.68 --> 10467.279
etc etc so

10467.68 --> 10471.56
that is the live chat

10485.92 --> 10488.92
right

10494.399 --> 10497.278999999999
anyway i hope you guys have been

10495.76 --> 10500.64
enjoying the show

10497.279 --> 10503.52
it's been over the place

10500.64 --> 10505.599999999999
and very passionate here and there even

10503.52 --> 10508.0
though apparently my sound does kind of

10505.6 --> 10509.76
like blow out when i get pissed off

10508.0 --> 10511.04
that's why i try to get pissed off at

10509.76 --> 10515.12
the camera

10511.04 --> 10516.399000000001
and not at my mic which is over there

10515.12 --> 10519.12
see

10516.399 --> 10520.8
do that on purpose if i put my mic right

10519.12 --> 10524.08
in front of me i'll just bump into it

10520.8 --> 10525.759999999998
with my teeth when i get pissed off so

10524.08 --> 10527.2
i don't want to do that so i just go

10525.76 --> 10531.2
like

10527.2 --> 10533.6
and then it's like on the side

10531.2 --> 10535.84
and then hopefully i don't like get pop

10533.6 --> 10537.279
noises

10535.84 --> 10540.24
and don't

10537.279 --> 10543.52
yeah don't get too loud

10540.24 --> 10545.84
yeah so i've got a system to it

10543.52 --> 10548.0
i got a system to ragewind believe it or

10545.84 --> 10548.0
not

10551.52 --> 10555.6
but yeah when i get really loud it just

10554.0 --> 10557.279
doesn't matter i can be like a two

10555.6 --> 10559.92
meters distance and i'm gonna blow out

10557.279 --> 10563.04
the mic so

10559.92 --> 10565.84
but i try to avoid that

10563.04 --> 10568.640000000001
by just not getting that pissed off

10565.84 --> 10570.880000000001
or rather not bumping into situation

10568.64 --> 10573.84
where i will get that pissed off i

10570.88 --> 10573.839999999998
should say

10591.76 --> 10597.52
all right so yeah i'm gonna

10594.56 --> 10601.199999999999
well not join the flat earth debates of

10597.52 --> 10602.479000000001
course because there isn't any

10601.2 --> 10607.12
to

10602.479 --> 10607.119999999999
probably continue watching owen benjamin

10609.2 --> 10612.6
later today

10634.56 --> 10637.56
hmm

10647.52 --> 10652.640000000001
hmm

10649.76 --> 10652.64
that's interesting

10655.6 --> 10659.92
yeah there's this is like interesting

10657.52 --> 10662.0
because there's like getting more more

10659.92 --> 10663.6
farmers in the netherlands are like

10662.0 --> 10666.8
taking the rare

10663.6 --> 10668.720000000001
and basically expressing

10666.8 --> 10671.199999999999
how pissed off they are well they're not

10668.72 --> 10674.399
going like rage win like me

10671.2 --> 10676.720000000001
but i am seeing more like yeah this is

10674.399 --> 10679.119999999999
gone far enough type of

10676.72 --> 10680.56
messages from these farmers so really

10679.12 --> 10682.240000000002
interested in where that's going i'm

10680.56 --> 10684.399
really appreciating that they're doing

10682.24 --> 10687.92
that and i'm not the only one i mean a

10684.399 --> 10687.92
lot of people are very happy that

10688.8 --> 10691.679999999998
that that's happening

10694.88 --> 10698.24
this is cool yeah there's this dutch

10696.56 --> 10700.56
saying

10698.24 --> 10700.56
don't

10700.88 --> 10706.56
don't turn your heart into a murder pit

10705.2 --> 10709.279
and that means

10706.56 --> 10711.359
don't if you're like really pissed off

10709.279 --> 10713.04
don't keep it inside express it

10711.359 --> 10714.800000000001
otherwise

10713.04 --> 10719.2
it's going to be like

10714.8 --> 10719.199999999999
a hellish prison inside of you in secret

10719.359 --> 10724.640000000001
it's an interesting saying

10721.279 --> 10726.399000000001
i think that very much applies to me

10724.64 --> 10728.399
because that is part of the reason why i

10726.399 --> 10731.439
even do it i throw it out because i have

10728.399 --> 10731.439
to even if i can

10731.52 --> 10736.479000000001
can get it to make as much sense as i

10734.479 --> 10739.599999999999
want it to do i have to throw it out

10736.479 --> 10742.319
somehow and then hopefully while i do it

10739.6 --> 10744.319
i find that purpose

10742.319 --> 10748.399
because if i just keep it inside of me

10744.319 --> 10748.399
it's gonna like completely twist me

10748.56 --> 10754.68
just these type of sensations if you

10751.359 --> 10754.68
know what i mean

10758.8 --> 10763.278999999999
right

10760.8 --> 10766.8
yeah pjc net but these farmers are like

10763.279 --> 10769.52
having real serious issues because

10766.8 --> 10771.278999999999
i mean the electric prices are hitting

10769.52 --> 10774.399000000001
them too

10771.279 --> 10776.640000000001
right on top of this idiotic

10774.399 --> 10776.64
uh

10776.96 --> 10779.119999999999
uh

10777.76 --> 10781.6
nitrogen

10779.12 --> 10783.76
crisis which is complete phony

10781.6 --> 10786.24
right on top of that they are getting

10783.76 --> 10789.52
these insane electric bills as well it's

10786.24 --> 10789.52
like jesus man

10789.6 --> 10796.08
i really hope they figure a way out to

10792.64 --> 10798.64
figure out a way to get through this

10796.08 --> 10801.279
because otherwise it is as i said before

10798.64 --> 10803.519999999999
like it sounds when i go rachel in and

10801.279 --> 10805.68
exaggerated it's all gonna die around

10803.52 --> 10807.92
you yeah that oh it sounds so dramatic

10805.68 --> 10811.359
yeah but what if that's actually

10807.92 --> 10812.960000000001
literally real okay

10811.359 --> 10816.0
i mean it's not going to happen from one

10812.96 --> 10816.0
day to the other but

10816.08 --> 10819.6
like this slides getting pretty steep i

10818.399 --> 10821.039999999999
think

10819.6 --> 10823.279
so

10821.04 --> 10825.439
it's always the dilemma with rage win

10823.279 --> 10828.24
isn't it is like oh it sounds like he's

10825.439 --> 10829.76
exaggerating yeah but am i actually

10828.24 --> 10832.24
exaggerating

10829.76 --> 10835.2
or do you just want it to be an

10832.24 --> 10835.199999999999
exaggeration

10835.439 --> 10839.279
think about it very carefully and take

10837.439 --> 10842.319
your time

10839.279 --> 10845.92
thinking about it look at the world

10842.319 --> 10845.92
was i really exaggerating

10846.56 --> 10850.72
don't don't blow it off too quickly

10851.52 --> 10855.76
right anyway

10854.24 --> 10860.6
i am going to round out the show because

10855.76 --> 10860.6
i hit the three hour mark

10868.96 --> 10874.0
yeah could you see that let's

10871.439 --> 10875.92
[ __ ] themselves

10874.0 --> 10879.96
monsters like it's literally gonna make

10875.92 --> 10879.960000000001
everybody sick and die

10880.0 --> 10887.68
it does eating bugs is not a staple diet

10885.52 --> 10889.92
i mean i'm pretty sure that even in like

10887.68 --> 10892.0
the asian countries where they really

10889.92 --> 10895.04
like to do that

10892.0 --> 10895.92
fried spiders and whatever they eat

10895.04 --> 10898.560000000001
right

10895.92 --> 10901.359
guess what that's not their standard

10898.56 --> 10903.92
diet that's not like the only thing they

10901.359 --> 10905.68
eat they eat that on the side why would

10903.92 --> 10908.88
that be

10905.68 --> 10911.92
because it's really unhealthy for you to

10908.88 --> 10912.72
eat that all the time there's adjutants

10911.92 --> 10914.0
in

10912.72 --> 10916.08
insects

10914.0 --> 10919.359
that are literally gonna cause you to

10916.08 --> 10923.039999999999
get cancer if you eat too much of it

10919.359 --> 10925.359
there's toxic stuff in there and humans

10923.04 --> 10928.240000000002
cannot properly digest

10925.359 --> 10930.24
it's going to bio accumulate right i

10928.24 --> 10933.039999999999
mean if you eat like

10930.24 --> 10935.76
a bog or a grasshopper

10933.04 --> 10937.279
like one a month or something gross i'm

10935.76 --> 10939.12
not gonna do that

10937.279 --> 10941.279
but that be like yeah okay you could

10939.12 --> 10943.359
handle it right you can just have some

10941.279 --> 10946.0
other food on the side normal food maybe

10943.359 --> 10948.24
some beef chicken and then maybe like a

10946.0 --> 10951.439
cricket or something

10948.24 --> 10953.52
or a grasshopper in the month

10951.439 --> 10955.359
that's like doable but if you're like

10953.52 --> 10958.24
gonna have like

10955.359 --> 10960.0
eight bucks every day

10958.24 --> 10962.64
you're gonna get sick

10960.0 --> 10964.399
and you're gonna die

10962.64 --> 10966.8
guarantee it

10964.399 --> 10969.92
garron tea

10966.8 --> 10972.96
you will not be able to survive that

10969.92 --> 10974.960000000001
on the long run you might hold out for a

10972.96 --> 10977.358999999999
while depending on your metabolism

10974.96 --> 10979.119999999999
strength and on your will right some

10977.359 --> 10981.12
people may hold out

10979.12 --> 10983.2
five years

10981.12 --> 10984.800000000001
some people might even hold out 10 years

10983.2 --> 10986.16
if they're like super driven or

10984.8 --> 10987.759999999998
something they have some religious

10986.16 --> 10989.84
mission doing it

10987.76 --> 10991.439
but the general public

10989.84 --> 10993.84
has other

10991.439 --> 10995.92
physical calamities and issues not

10993.84 --> 10998.08
knowing how to deal with stress addicted

10995.92 --> 10999.52
to pharmaceuticals how do you think

10998.08 --> 11001.6
they're gonna fare

10999.52 --> 11003.6
they're gonna die

11001.6 --> 11006.08
quickly

11003.6 --> 11007.76
yeah what about freaking vaccine damaged

11006.08 --> 11009.76
people yeah

11007.76 --> 11012.24
they're myocarditis and all that other

11009.76 --> 11013.68
crap which is terrible

11012.24 --> 11015.039999999999
how do you think they're gonna fair

11013.68 --> 11017.6
eating bugs

11015.04 --> 11020.6
every day they're gonna die

11017.6 --> 11020.6
quick

11021.279 --> 11024.399000000001
this is insane

11026.399 --> 11030.24
i mean they might have just to say like

11028.64 --> 11032.479
yeah we got

11030.24 --> 11035.439
we got suicide pills for everybody the

11032.479 --> 11037.76
official one pill of dreon right

11035.439 --> 11040.24
we we got that everybody just eat your

11037.76 --> 11041.76
pill of dreon now

11040.24 --> 11044.399
because that's the solution that we've

11041.76 --> 11045.68
designated for you

11044.399 --> 11048.399
right

11045.68 --> 11051.359
it's really not that far off you're

11048.399 --> 11054.399
gonna eat bugs now standard

11051.359 --> 11054.399000000001
it's gonna kill you

11054.64 --> 11059.68
it's not just gross

11056.88 --> 11062.64
it's gonna kill you

11059.68 --> 11065.359
you can't eat that all the time

11062.64 --> 11066.8
there's toxins in there that cannot be

11065.359 --> 11069.359
taken out

11066.8 --> 11071.599999999999
that you're gonna bio-accumulate then

11069.359 --> 11075.479000000001
you're gonna get cancer

11071.6 --> 11075.479000000001
and then you're gonna die

11080.319 --> 11086.08
