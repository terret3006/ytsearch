so yeah the weather today

109.2 --> 113.119

from yesterday it's mostly clouded

116.24 --> 121.6
they're rushing by up there

119.6 --> 124.41
yesterday it's been raining pretty much

121.6 --> 126.32
the entire evening and afternoon

124.41 --> 128.16
[Music]

126.32 --> 129.44
but yeah in the night it started to kind

128.16 --> 133.44
of

129.44 --> 133.44
be like this not a lot of rain

136.319 --> 142.04
but still a lot of clouds and yeah wind

151.92 --> 154.92
right

168.879 --> 174.92
right it is tuesday the 7th of june

171.92 --> 174.92
2022.

178.0 --> 182.76
there's nobody in chat just yet

189.36 --> 191.84
all right

197.519 --> 201.68
so yesterday's flat earth debate was

199.76 --> 204.48
pretty good and i thought my own show

201.68 --> 206.64000000000001
despite it being short was really good

204.48 --> 207.76
i was watched most of it back and it was

206.64 --> 211.159
really good

207.76 --> 211.159
i liked it

217.44 --> 223.599
uh yeah there were plenty of streams

219.599 --> 223.599
yesterday didn't catch all of them

223.92 --> 227.83999999999997
but uh yeah nathan oakley's

228.319 --> 234.48
flat earth debate was pretty good

230.879 --> 236.48
so everybody was like really in the flow

234.48 --> 239.04
and had an interesting conversation in

236.48 --> 242.48
the after show with brian

239.04 --> 244.319
about gps like the mechanical

242.48 --> 248.39999999999998
functioning of it

244.319 --> 248.39999999999998
and we were in disagreement about it

249.04 --> 255.12
and i'm still kind of like holding

251.04 --> 260.12
strong on that argument that we had

255.12 --> 260.12
and okay where the hell is everybody

275.68 --> 280.40000000000003
right anyway

277.759 --> 282.8
jim bob was also live

280.4 --> 285.84
at an interesting show like another

282.8 --> 285.84000000000003
character on there

287.44 --> 291.36
and yeah i was very active in chat

295.44 --> 299.44
it's kind of funny watching it like in

297.44 --> 302.88
reflection to like the situation with

299.44 --> 304.16
the troll on my show earlier telling me

302.88 --> 306.32
like oh

304.16 --> 308.96000000000004
jim i was much

306.32 --> 311.84
more in control of his emotions and it's

308.96 --> 311.84
just really funny

312.4 --> 317.039
to reflect upon that

314.639 --> 319.6
like not even without agitation i really

317.039 --> 319.59999999999997
don't mind

322.84 --> 326.15999999999997
uh see

326.56 --> 332.12
ah hello mike's doonage first in chat

343.28 --> 348.479
so yeah yeah i

346.16 --> 350.08000000000004
i'm guess i'm just watching star wars

348.479 --> 353.75899999999996
again

350.08 --> 357.039
as i watched the star wars

353.759 --> 357.039
the empire strikes back

357.199 --> 364.56
and it is so odd in ways because

361.199 --> 367.199
well it i do i have like the

364.56 --> 369.199
altered version

367.199 --> 371.759
and i technically don't really like

369.199 --> 374.8
those compared to just the old versions

371.759 --> 376.72
without all the new cgi added and all

374.8 --> 378.88
that

376.72 --> 380.88000000000005
but i bet that those are pretty hard to

378.88 --> 384.56
find now

380.88 --> 384.56
though they should still be out there

389.6 --> 395.56
it's just that all that extra stuff

391.68 --> 395.56
makes it different

401.12 --> 406.479
it's just more distraction more

402.96 --> 409.68
distracting to just like the

406.479 --> 411.599
supposed cold hard reality of

409.68 --> 413.52
how things are done

411.599 --> 416.0
in that universe

413.52 --> 418.88
right all the extra distractions well

416.0 --> 420.479
they just distract away from that

418.88 --> 425.12
i always thought that that was like one

420.479 --> 427.599
of the main powers of star wars is that

425.12 --> 430.16
it really pulled you into that

427.599 --> 431.84
atmosphere that

430.16 --> 434.72
the style and

431.84 --> 437.19899999999996
the code of conduct and

434.72 --> 439.68
the music and sound effects it's all

437.199 --> 441.84000000000003
like cosmetic but it really worked all

439.68 --> 446.88
together really well so i think that

441.84 --> 446.88
still the unedited originals are better

447.039 --> 449.68
although like

448.8 --> 450.56
yeah

449.68 --> 452.28000000000003
no

450.56 --> 453.68
i stand by that

452.28 --> 454.73999999999995
[Music]

453.68 --> 456.96
anyways

454.74 --> 459.84000000000003
[Music]

456.96 --> 465.28999999999996
slow start how are you never watch the

459.84 --> 468.339
single star wars star trek what okay

465.29 --> 468.339
[Music]

472.46 --> 475.64
[Music]

478.31 --> 481.48
[Music]

484.56 --> 488.879
also a thing that i'm really noticing of

486.96 --> 490.96
just about star wars in general the

488.879 --> 494.8
older movies

490.96 --> 497.599
is the way things happen like things

494.8 --> 501.199
yoda does and

497.599 --> 502.479
it's all for the story it really is

501.199 --> 504.16
because

502.479 --> 507.199
a lot of it really doesn't make any

504.16 --> 509.28000000000003
logical sense it is purely for like the

507.199 --> 511.759
mystique and the story build up for the

509.28 --> 511.75899999999996
watcher

511.919 --> 515.76
is almost more like

513.839 --> 520.2790000000001
their theater people

515.76 --> 520.279
entertaining the theater

520.399 --> 523.36
when you think about it

527.76 --> 533.12
because like in my mind it's like very

530.48 --> 535.9200000000001
easy to like completely let it roll out

533.12 --> 539.04
differently but yeah you wouldn't have

535.92 --> 541.519
the star wars you knew that

539.04 --> 543.4399999999999
it's just funny how that all works

541.519 --> 546.16
anyway

543.44 --> 546.1600000000001
that to work

547.6 --> 553.0400000000001
hey tomenoid

549.92 --> 556.0
don't mention the prequels

553.04 --> 556.0
lord of sequels

557.839 --> 561.08
why not

562.24 --> 568.0
i mean the phantom menace was like

565.04 --> 568.0
really annoying

568.32 --> 572.1600000000001
but

569.519 --> 574.32
there's another version out of out there

572.16 --> 577.8389999999999
called the phantom edit which is

574.32 --> 577.839
actually kind of decent

578.56 --> 582.88
they edited out a whole bunch of

580.399 --> 585.68
nonsense distractions

582.88 --> 587.4399999999999
and makes it a much more tannable movie

585.68 --> 589.68
much more

587.44 --> 591.9200000000001
actual feel of the original star wars

589.68 --> 594.0799999999999
movies it almost

591.92 --> 594.0799999999999
so

596.32 --> 601.8000000000001
what to see top gun last night okay

609.12 --> 612.88
hello gadget inspector

624.399 --> 628.32
yeah i'm hearing a lot about

626.079 --> 630.88
a lot i'm hearing from here and there

628.32 --> 634.5600000000001
about top gun the new movie and

630.88 --> 637.2
that it's a real effort and

634.56 --> 638.56
i think i'll probably enjoy it despite

637.2 --> 642.399
everything

638.56 --> 642.399
but i'm not gonna like watch it now

642.88 --> 648.0
in theater or anything i'm just gonna

645.04 --> 651.92
wait until it's like

648.0 --> 651.92
until basically people stop caring

654.48 --> 657.48
uh

671.2 --> 675.0
story is crap

675.76 --> 680.399
okay

677.519 --> 683.2
how is it crap is it any more crap than

680.399 --> 683.2
the original

684.24 --> 689.59
or is it like with propaganda nonsense

687.6 --> 692.889
or what

689.59 --> 692.889
[Music]

699.92 --> 702.92
anyway

713.2 --> 717.9200000000001
right also continued watching this weird

718.16 --> 720.7199999999999
he-man

721.04 --> 726.0
mini

722.32 --> 728.8000000000001
series thing and it is it's so weird man

726.0 --> 731.92
it's almost like a crossover between

728.8 --> 735.5999999999999
like he-man and game of thrones even

731.92 --> 738.7199999999999
like it gets like really freaking brutal

735.6 --> 738.72
and like what the [ __ ]

740.0 --> 744.0
like

741.04 --> 746.399
yeah in the original he-man it's like

744.0 --> 746.399
really

746.56 --> 751.1199999999999
cute and for kitties and sometimes kind

749.2 --> 753.44
of gay even

751.12 --> 755.279
like nobody gets killed

753.44 --> 756.1600000000001
it's like

755.279 --> 759.8389999999999
no

756.16 --> 759.8389999999999
well this one

761.279 --> 765.519
but it gets quite surreal

766.72 --> 769.76
so i'm kind of like

770.639 --> 775.76
yeah i'm gonna continue watching it i'm

773.279 --> 779.12
like halfway a little over halfway it is

775.76 --> 780.3199999999999
getting it really weird and interesting

779.12 --> 782.399
just

780.32 --> 786.24
and like there's there's so much

782.399 --> 788.639
attention to like the magic of eternia

786.24 --> 788.639
and like

788.72 --> 791.839
jesus all these

790.32 --> 794.9590000000001
outfits man

791.839 --> 794.9590000000001
it's really about that

795.92 --> 797.92
i mean

796.8 --> 799.3599999999999
like this

797.92 --> 803.1999999999999
cartoon

799.36 --> 806.5600000000001
could probably actually like

803.2 --> 808.9590000000001
make people buy the dolls again

806.56 --> 810.88
or the new dolls you know you know how

808.959 --> 813.68
that goes with industry

810.88 --> 815.279
because like dude they spent a lot of

813.68 --> 818.4799999999999
effort on that

815.279 --> 819.76
unlike the outfits and all that

818.48 --> 822.24
and style

819.76 --> 824.959
i'm sorry this is very un

822.24 --> 826.9590000000001
and top gun i know

824.959 --> 828.959
it's it's just happened to be the thing

826.959 --> 832.0
that i also would have been watching

828.959 --> 832.0
besides star wars

840.48 --> 843.9200000000001

859.199 --> 861.4399999999999
what

863.199 --> 867.8
i'm sorry is

864.8 --> 867.8
what

870.399 --> 873.44
what's

871.279 --> 876.959
crappy about falling in love i i don't

873.44 --> 880.24
get it probably the context

876.959 --> 883.6389999999999
it's it's gonna be cheesy i mean

880.24 --> 883.639
what do you expect

894.56 --> 901.6389999999999
tarantino's top gun ran yeah talk

897.279 --> 901.639
goodness gay yeah i've heard that

918.959 --> 924.0
i mean when you yeah when you really

921.44 --> 927.12
think about it carefully like top gun

924.0 --> 929.36
does kind of effectively mean

927.12 --> 930.48
the biggest dick

929.36 --> 932.9590000000001
i mean

930.48 --> 932.9590000000001
come on

939.44 --> 943.0400000000001
you know it'd be true

943.199 --> 946.959
hey len lenox good to see you

947.04 --> 953.7199999999999

communication oh really

977.839 --> 980.839
okay that

979.199 --> 983.279
that would be

980.839 --> 985.759
really lame

983.279 --> 986.8
if top gun did that that's

985.759 --> 990.36
really

986.8 --> 990.3599999999999
really lameness

1051.6 --> 1059.28
yeah for the time being at least

1055.12 --> 1061.9189999999999
but i did kind of start early again so

1059.28 --> 1066.36
usually somewhere in the last half hour

1061.919 --> 1066.3600000000001
they do come rolling in

1078.88 --> 1082.4
okay seanders

office

1107.52 --> 1111.36
well

1108.48 --> 1113.44
i would be getting like a notification

1111.36 --> 1115.36
about it at least

1113.44 --> 1117.039
if it's like a bigger package and they

1115.36 --> 1118.7199999999998
can't

1117.039 --> 1120.559

1133.6 --> 1137.4399999999998

1135.6 --> 1139.4399999999998
because every

1137.44 --> 1141.679
like everything i ever bought from the

1139.44 --> 1144.4
us like tobacco

1141.679 --> 1150.4
or like infowars store products have

1144.4 --> 1151.2
always taken like insane amounts of time

1150.4 --> 1153.52
like

1151.2 --> 1156.16
two three months

1153.52 --> 1156.16
on average

1156.83 --> 1160.24
[Music]

1159.12 --> 1162.1599999999999

i did yeah i don't

1162.16 --> 1168.0
i don't know if it's going to be the

all the time in the winter or something

1553.52 --> 1557.279
right but at least the plants are

1555.36 --> 1560.32
getting something out of this

a tribe of trolls no

1711.12 --> 1715.76
that's too specific

like a tribe of trolls would literally

1715.76 --> 1719.919
be

1716.48 --> 1722.08
like the social hierarchy a tribe

1719.919 --> 1725.2
trolls do actually live in tribes but

1722.08 --> 1727.279
it's about a group of them

1725.2 --> 1730.48
it's like a group is going around how do

1727.279 --> 1732.0
you designate them well a band it's

1730.48 --> 1733.6
gonna be a band

1732.0 --> 1735.84
they're not gonna be traveling with too

1733.6 --> 1735.84

humanoid robot

a robot doesn't say anything

2195.92 --> 2199.2000000000003
a robot to do what

2199.52 --> 2204.8
to build

2200.72 --> 2204.7999999999997
machines in a factory to

2204.96 --> 2210.4
do policing to do carrier work and i

2208.8 --> 2211.8390000000004
mean technically

2210.4 --> 2215.2000000000003
a drone

2211.839 --> 2216.16
is can also be a robot that has like

2226.079 --> 2232.7200000000003
so a humanoid and for what what is that

2229.359 --> 2232.72
humanoid gonna do

2236.16 --> 2241.52
i mean if it's just a thing to sort of

2239.04 --> 2242.88
mimic a human then what the hell's the

2249.76 --> 2254.7200000000003
the freaking purpose of such a thing

how is it going to pay off

he didn't say in the article so it's

just like oh look at the robot oh it's

2266.88 --> 2271.76
going to you over in the

2268.839 --> 2273.23

how

2277.76 --> 2282.96
effectively i wasted like

2280.72 --> 2285.7599999999998
all this money on

2282.96 --> 2288.32
a robot just to look like it is kind of

wow

2336.0 --> 2339.76
i mean that's like the

2338.0 --> 2342.0
was it again

2339.76 --> 2344.2400000000002
the old series this six million dollar

2342.0 --> 2347.119
man

2344.24 --> 2349.7599999999998
that is like oh look at that

2347.119 --> 2351.599
he's half he's a more robot than a

2349.76 --> 2353.6800000000003
person but he looks exactly like a

2351.599 --> 2355.599
person because that makes it really

2353.68 --> 2358.3999999999996
cheap

2355.599 --> 2361.04
for the theater crowd

2358.4 --> 2363.52
right like and then what's the purpose

2361.04 --> 2365.7599999999998
of all that investment he is just a

2363.52 --> 2368.88
human he does nothing out of the

2365.76 --> 2372.96
ordinary i mean of course that's worth

2368.88 --> 2374.56
the investment of 6 million

2372.96 --> 2376.2400000000002
which yeah would have been a lot more

2374.56 --> 2377.68
back then right

2376.24 --> 2379.04
but

2377.68 --> 2381.2799999999997
like no

2379.04 --> 2383.7599999999998
the point is is like oh he's a super

2381.28 --> 2386.8
robot man he can do all this stuff now

2383.76 --> 2388.96
and do amazing things

2386.8 --> 2391.119
and then it's like oh oh yeah that's

2388.96 --> 2393.44
kind of worth the investment then i

2391.119 --> 2395.2000000000003
guess but if it's just like oh look at

2393.44 --> 2397.119
our robot technology we got all the

2395.2 --> 2399.52
movement everything it's just like a

2397.119 --> 2401.6800000000003
human it's like oh oh re so what are you

2399.52 --> 2404.4
gonna do with it

2401.68 --> 2406.72
to make it worth that investment

2404.4 --> 2406.7200000000003
huh

2407.68 --> 2413.1189999999997
what are you gonna do with it how is it

2410.4 --> 2415.44
gonna pay itself off

2413.119 --> 2415.44
i mean

2422.88 --> 2429.04
robo sleeves of course

2425.599 --> 2431.3590000000004
okay and how is that gonna be worth it

2429.04 --> 2432.8
because i think that human slaves are

2431.359 --> 2436.48
still

2432.8 --> 2439.8390000000004
effectively a lot cheaper

2436.48 --> 2439.839
and easier to maintain

2441.2 --> 2445.2
i mean

2442.24 --> 2445.2
humans heal

2445.599 --> 2450.96
like when robots break down it's usually

2448.56 --> 2453.24
you need engineers it's gonna take some

2450.96 --> 2455.2
time there will be complete

2453.24 --> 2457.1189999999997
non-functionality if you got a whole

2455.2 --> 2458.8799999999997
setup of robots that are all working

2457.119 --> 2462.079
into one another and one breaks down

2458.88 --> 2465.04
they all break down effective right

2462.079 --> 2467.04
you don't have those issues with humans

2465.04 --> 2469.119
not like that anyway you're gonna have

2467.04 --> 2470.96
to deal with some social issues perhaps

2469.119 --> 2472.1600000000003
but

2470.96 --> 2475.04
just

2472.16 --> 2477.2
a little bit good at that it's a lot

2475.04 --> 2478.839
more efficient

2477.2 --> 2482.48
right so

2478.839 --> 2485.44
yeah robo-slaves of course yeah no not

2482.48 --> 2490.079
of course it's not of course at all

2485.44 --> 2490.079
it's all a pipe dream guys this is all

2490.24 --> 2495.2
hyper rich people

2492.48 --> 2498.079
that are just fantasizing about not

2495.2 --> 2500.24
needing other humans anymore so they

2498.079 --> 2502.96
can't be confronted what kind of pieces

2500.24 --> 2505.2799999999997
of garbage they really are so they

2502.96 --> 2506.839
fantasize about replacing those humans

2505.28 --> 2510.48
with feelingless

2506.839 --> 2513.44
robots it will not reflect upon them

2510.48 --> 2515.52
back what kind of a terrible disgusting

2513.44 --> 2517.92
human beings they really are that should

2515.52 --> 2519.119
actually just die

2517.92 --> 2521.2000000000003
right

2519.119 --> 2522.96
so they fantasize about their stupid

2521.2 --> 2525.359
robots but

2522.96 --> 2527.92
it doesn't do anything like

2525.359 --> 2530.0
it's not something that can be realized

2527.92 --> 2532.64
and be effective

2530.0 --> 2536.079
it's all a pipe dream

2532.64 --> 2540.48
it's all nonsense

2536.079 --> 2540.48
they can't do without humans

2541.119 --> 2546.2400000000002
it's like the ultimate curse

2543.839 --> 2547.839
they hate it but they can't do without

2546.24 --> 2550.319
it

2547.839 --> 2552.24
so they waste all their time and energy

2550.319 --> 2555.44
and

2552.24 --> 2557.52
to fantasize some kind of a humanless

2555.44 --> 2560.319
future it is complete

2557.52 --> 2563.119
nonsense all of it

2560.319 --> 2565.839
nothing about it will work

2563.119 --> 2565.839
nothing

2582.43 --> 2585.58
[Music]

2587.04 --> 2593.8
inspector catches yeah but inspector

2589.359 --> 2593.7999999999997
gadget is quite fictional

2603.2 --> 2607.839
no will smith's warning

2605.359 --> 2607.839
no

2614.0 --> 2617.119
i mean no

2617.2 --> 2624.64
i mean how many centuries need to pass

2621.76 --> 2626.88
and a century is a long

2624.64 --> 2629.04
break in time okay

2626.88 --> 2631.28
by the time that we could even get to

2629.04 --> 2633.7599999999998
that point of perfecting robotics to

2631.28 --> 2636.1600000000003
that level

2633.76 --> 2638.2400000000002
like human society would have completely

2636.16 --> 2642.24
disintegrated

2638.24 --> 2647.04
from just the systemic cultural attack

2642.24 --> 2649.52
and the entire bad situation

2647.04 --> 2651.68
sodom and gomorrah influence like it's

2649.52 --> 2653.839
never gonna reach it don't you get it

2651.68 --> 2654.72
it's impossible it's never going to

2653.839 --> 2658.16
happen

2654.72 --> 2661.1189999999997
none of it is it's all lies it's all

2658.16 --> 2663.7599999999998
futurist nightmare dreams that they

2661.119 --> 2667.119
can't realize they can never make it

2663.76 --> 2670.3190000000004
real but they can make you believe it's

2667.119 --> 2673.44
real like nothing you've ever seen

2670.319 --> 2675.2
all they have to do is completely

2673.44 --> 2676.48
program you

2675.2 --> 2677.68
from birth

2676.48 --> 2681.16
to death

2677.68 --> 2684.48
with culture and fiction that is

2681.16 --> 2687.52
constantly suggesting it

2684.48 --> 2690.64
and then halfway the trip of your life

2687.52 --> 2693.28
you will know nothing else but that it

2690.64 --> 2696.319
is destined to happen because that's

2693.28 --> 2698.88
what you've been told indirectly through

2696.319 --> 2701.2799999999997
fiction through your education your

2698.88 --> 2705.8
entire life even though

2701.28 --> 2705.8
it is effectively not possible

2708.079 --> 2713.2000000000003
it's all futurist sci-fi nonsense

2711.599 --> 2715.44
programming

2713.2 --> 2719.839
doesn't work

2715.44 --> 2719.839
robots can't take over like that

2722.72 --> 2728.24
i mean look at how early we could

2725.359 --> 2730.56
envision and

2728.24 --> 2733.2
like trick together through movies

2730.56 --> 2735.839
robots right robot also fascinating

2733.2 --> 2738.56
robots like in the earliest freaking

2735.839 --> 2741.44
movie even in black and white days

2738.56 --> 2744.24
robots they were all the [ __ ]

2741.44 --> 2746.8
oh so many envisioned things about how

2744.24 --> 2749.68
intelligent they could be and

2746.8 --> 2750.7200000000003
all the incredible potential

2749.68 --> 2756.64
yeah

2750.72 --> 2756.64
it's been over a hundred years

2757.359 --> 2762.64
look at everything that's happened and

2759.44 --> 2763.839
look at the level where they're at now

2762.64 --> 2768.16
dude

2763.839 --> 2771.2799999999997
it's still to this day not even close

2768.16 --> 2775.1189999999997
to anything they're still stumbling

2771.28 --> 2778.6400000000003
around with this [ __ ] stumbling around

2775.119 --> 2780.56
it's killing itself it's never like it's

2778.64 --> 2783.839
not becoming

2780.56 --> 2786.72
what they really hoped

2783.839 --> 2788.48
it's just not working like envision

2786.72 --> 2790.9599999999996
it's not efficient enough it's not going

2788.48 --> 2790.96
to work

2791.359 --> 2798.0
it's just a robotic freakazoid machine

2794.48 --> 2800.72
fest and it's never going to actually be

2798.0 --> 2803.839
able to replace humanity it's just not

2800.72 --> 2803.839
going to work

2804.0 --> 2807.04
it's not gonna work

2811.2 --> 2816.7999999999997
i mean maybe it could

2813.2 --> 2819.52
partially destroy humanity

2816.8 --> 2822.319
right that's not gonna replace it that

2819.52 --> 2825.28
means it's just gone

2822.319 --> 2826.64
right no no more slaves for you rich

2825.28 --> 2828.7200000000003
people

2826.64 --> 2831.44
yeah yeah you can kill off your slaves

2828.72 --> 2834.64
you can't replace them though

2831.44 --> 2835.92
with your stupid futurist robot

2834.64 --> 2838.48
fantasies

2835.92 --> 2841.44
in your little solo cystic

2838.48 --> 2842.839
nightmare world yeah yeah that's always

2841.44 --> 2844.559
gonna be

2842.839 --> 2848.0789999999997
fantasy

2844.559 --> 2849.76
because it can't work you can't make it

2848.079 --> 2852.96
work no matter

2849.76 --> 2854.48
how much money you pour onto it no

2852.96 --> 2856.2400000000002
matter how many

2854.48 --> 2859.76
brains

2856.24 --> 2862.4799999999996
you bind to it you can't make it work it

2859.76 --> 2862.48
can't work

2869.44 --> 2874.319
yeah no caps thanks

2872.559 --> 2876.7200000000003
vlad today saints

2874.319 --> 2876.72
hello

2877.52 --> 2883.839
robot snake eating itself right

2881.119 --> 2886.7200000000003
i don't believe it i i literally i'm

2883.839 --> 2889.44
saying it right now it's a pipe dream

2886.72 --> 2892.24
this declaration this is

2889.44 --> 2895.44
prophecy if you will

2892.24 --> 2898.0
i don't think it is possible to work

2895.44 --> 2900.7200000000003
they can't make it work no matter the

2898.0 --> 2903.04
money no matter the resources no matter

2900.72 --> 2904.9599999999996
the power they can't make it work it's

2903.04 --> 2908.88
always going to be a pipe dream they

2904.96 --> 2908.88
will never be able to make it work

2912.559 --> 2918.48
it's always gonna end up breaking down

2915.359 --> 2920.0
using humans instead will

2918.48 --> 2921.76
always

2920.0 --> 2923.44
work out better

2921.76 --> 2925.3590000000004
always

2923.44 --> 2929.839
for the rest

2925.359 --> 2929.839
natural history in this realm

2931.52 --> 2934.319
right

2932.64 --> 2937.1189999999997
it doesn't mean that you can't use

2934.319 --> 2939.52
robots for very specific things that are

2937.119 --> 2942.0
like super hazardous to humans for

2939.52 --> 2945.319
example right that's where really comes

2942.0 --> 2948.0
in but yeah that's not the universal

2945.319 --> 2949.44
situation now isn't it

2948.0 --> 2950.319
so

2949.44 --> 2953.04
yeah

2950.319 --> 2956.64
robots really cool

2953.04 --> 2958.16
they're never going to replace

2956.64 --> 2960.0789999999997
humans

2958.16 --> 2962.5589999999997
with functionality

2960.079 --> 2963.76
that parts never gonna happen

2962.559 --> 2966.0
sure

2963.76 --> 2969.76
you can make them do really tough things

2966.0 --> 2969.76
that humans really can't

2969.839 --> 2973.599
right

2970.64 --> 2975.2
or yeah you could turn them into like a

2973.599 --> 2976.6400000000003
merciless

2975.2 --> 2979.2
war machine

2976.64 --> 2982.8799999999997
which is kind of scary

2979.2 --> 2984.3999999999996
but you can never make them replace the

2982.88 --> 2985.2000000000003
humans

2984.4 --> 2987.119
yeah

2985.2 --> 2989.1189999999997
that's not possible

2987.119 --> 2991.76
you need to get over that you need to

2989.119 --> 2996.359
learn to deal with that or you're just

2991.76 --> 2996.3590000000004
going to destroy everything

3003.76 --> 3006.079
ah

3006.96 --> 3011.52
sounds like you're mistaking earlier mr

3010.079 --> 3013.2000000000003
plan

3011.52 --> 3016.64
dumbass you really don't even know how

3013.2 --> 3016.64
this freaking world works

3018.079 --> 3023.599
early cyber who do you think is putting

3020.88 --> 3025.839
that onto the map

3023.599 --> 3028.079
why do you think that got

3025.839 --> 3031.599
on television

3028.079 --> 3034.7200000000003
and in theaters in the first instance

3031.599 --> 3034.7200000000003
why do you think that

3035.04 --> 3039.52
there's people green lighting that stuff

3037.52 --> 3042.48
it's not just like every

3039.52 --> 3045.52
every random idea is just gonna be

3042.48 --> 3045.52
thrown on tv

3047.2 --> 3051.68
that may be local tv but that's not

3049.52 --> 3053.839
gonna that's not gonna sit like

3051.68 --> 3056.8799999999997
literally nobody will ever care it's

3053.839 --> 3059.2799999999997
just going to be like oh yeah some local

3056.88 --> 3060.96
thing that literally nobody will

3059.28 --> 3062.3190000000004
remember

3060.96 --> 3066.599
right

3062.319 --> 3066.599
but if it was futurist

3066.88 --> 3072.6400000000003
that had a lot of attention

3069.44 --> 3075.52
especially for social engineers we'd

3072.64 --> 3076.64
have just pretty much

3075.52 --> 3079.68
peaked

3076.64 --> 3082.16
we're ready to break open a new market

3079.68 --> 3085.04
through advertisement and radio and

3082.16 --> 3088.7999999999997
television they all knew that was coming

3085.04 --> 3093.119
so yeah it's all been programming all

3088.8 --> 3096.1600000000003
the futurist stuff was always there as

3093.119 --> 3097.04
programming including the really old

3096.16 --> 3101.44
[ __ ]

3097.04 --> 3101.44
with robots in black and white yeah

3101.76 --> 3107.1200000000003
so i'm not taking that back

3104.16 --> 3110.21
i totally called it

3107.12 --> 3110.21
[Music]

3114.22 --> 3117.27
[Music]

3121.599 --> 3126.0
sounds like you're

3122.839 --> 3128.35
underestimated the planning capability

3126.0 --> 3130.559
of the people that rule you

3128.35 --> 3133.52
[Music]

3130.559 --> 3135.119
that spend several generation

3133.52 --> 3138.92
generational

3135.119 --> 3138.92
plans of control

3167.44 --> 3173.88
are we cubing is just speculation no no

3170.48 --> 3173.88
it's a conclusion

3182.64 --> 3186.24
yeah they're up alert indeed

3192.88 --> 3198.079
that's right bjc net i'm glad you guys

3195.839 --> 3199.359
can see my point because

3198.079 --> 3200.7200000000003
people just

3199.359 --> 3202.5589999999997
it's like

3200.72 --> 3203.9199999999996
you end up

3202.559 --> 3207.92
wanting

3203.92 --> 3211.52
it to be real like terminator 2 is like

3207.92 --> 3211.52
oh my god the robots

3213.119 --> 3216.4
exterminate the humanity

3215.359 --> 3218.5589999999997
right

3216.4 --> 3221.04
and you just go like oh yeah it is

3218.559 --> 3221.0400000000004
possible

3221.839 --> 3225.7599999999998
wait for the nukes right and then the

3224.48 --> 3230.64
robots will be

3225.76 --> 3230.6400000000003
like dude that's a paranoid dream

3230.8 --> 3236.0
it's not possible

3232.72 --> 3238.9599999999996
it's not gonna happen like it it doesn't

3236.0 --> 3240.88
work like that

3238.96 --> 3243.44
if it could have worked like that then

3240.88 --> 3244.4
there would already be

3243.44 --> 3246.559
like

3244.4 --> 3249.6800000000003
robot factories

3246.559 --> 3252.0
making robots

3249.68 --> 3254.24
that are like self

3252.0 --> 3257.28
yeah robot factories making robot

3254.24 --> 3260.0
factories that's what you would have

3257.28 --> 3261.0400000000004
i don't think so like it doesn't really

3260.0 --> 3265.28
work

3261.04 --> 3268.24
it all has to be guided by people always

3265.28 --> 3268.2400000000002
always

3268.559 --> 3273.6800000000003
it cannot be fully automated

3271.44 --> 3277.839
that's always been the problem and it

3273.68 --> 3281.9199999999996
will always be the problem

3277.839 --> 3283.68
as soon as the overseer engineer

3281.92 --> 3285.119
dies or something

3283.68 --> 3286.48
or resigns

3285.119 --> 3289.92
like

3286.48 --> 3291.359
we do does not wish to continue

3289.92 --> 3293.6800000000003
operating

3291.359 --> 3294.96
the system the factory whatever he's

3293.68 --> 3297.9199999999996
running

3294.96 --> 3302.0
it's gonna run to a dead halt

3297.92 --> 3304.7200000000003
and it's not even gonna take that long

3302.0 --> 3307.839
because you require somebody to actually

3304.72 --> 3309.04
understand how it all works a human

3307.839 --> 3311.04
being

3309.04 --> 3314.72
if you don't have that

3311.04 --> 3316.72
it's just machine it's just slaves like

3314.72 --> 3318.9599999999996
tell us what to do tell us what to do

3316.72 --> 3324.0789999999997
that is basically what it is

3318.96 --> 3327.28
without a slave master a slave a robot

3324.079 --> 3327.28
literally the word

3327.52 --> 3331.44
it it doesn't work

3332.48 --> 3336.72
see

3333.68 --> 3339.7599999999998
so unless you're the ultimate mega

3336.72 --> 3342.72
genius super villain that can have like

3339.76 --> 3345.5200000000004
a giant engineered robot army all by

3342.72 --> 3347.52
yourself and you can do all of it

3345.52 --> 3348.72
it's not gonna work if you're just some

3347.52 --> 3351.28
rich

3348.72 --> 3353.2
weenie that's been spoiled all their

3351.28 --> 3355.76
life and think that they're little gods

3353.2 --> 3360.0
and disgusting and beyond human and

3355.76 --> 3360.0
you're not a freaking engineer

3360.24 --> 3365.4399999999996
you could dream about your robot army

3363.28 --> 3368.079
all day long you're never gonna get it

3365.44 --> 3371.44
because you're not an engineer you can't

3368.079 --> 3373.92
build them you can't fix them you can't

3371.44 --> 3377.16
have them

3373.92 --> 3377.16
get it

3396.72 --> 3401.9199999999996
i always break down that's right

3399.76 --> 3405.8390000000004
and i mean i have nothing against robots

3401.92 --> 3405.839
i think robots are great

3406.0 --> 3412.16
but a robot cannot

3408.48 --> 3412.16
survive without a human

3413.2 --> 3419.839
they are our slaves literally the name

3416.559 --> 3419.8390000000004
it's literally there

3422.319 --> 3427.319
they will always need us to exist

created

3559.76 --> 3565.92
for those words flat earth

3562.96 --> 3566.96
should be special fonts created just so

3565.92 --> 3572.2400000000002
you can

3566.96 --> 3573.839
extra emphasize flat earther

3572.24 --> 3575.4399999999996
you know why

3573.839 --> 3578.0789999999997
because anybody

3575.44 --> 3580.64
is going to be triggered this is like it

3578.079 --> 3583.3590000000004

talk about that you shouldn't say it

earth is flat you can't deal with that

if you can't even handle the words flat

3727.599 --> 3731.599
what the hell are you even doing there

3731.839 --> 3736.69

3749.76 --> 3753.92
all right there's a whole market for

that [ __ ] for people that can't

handle the truth there's an entire

3763.119 --> 3768.88
something about reality

3794.64 --> 3797.839
idiots

3795.839 --> 3799.839
people

3797.839 --> 3802.24
especially people that think other

3799.839 --> 3805.119
people are idiots and they are not but

3802.24 --> 3807.839
they can't back it with arguments

3805.119 --> 3809.44
yeah they can't actually respond to

3807.839 --> 3811.359
inquiry

3809.44 --> 3813.039
that's what makes me think of idiots

3811.359 --> 3816.16
people that

3813.039 --> 3819.92
think they can judge others

3816.16 --> 3822.5589999999997
in a context but then when addressed

3819.92 --> 3825.039
they can't actually back that context

3822.559 --> 3827.52
that's what i think are idiots

3825.039 --> 3829.76
yeah i don't care if people are

3827.52 --> 3830.799
programmed to think flat earthers are

3829.76 --> 3834.4
idiots

3830.799 --> 3837.4
that means they're idiots

3834.4 --> 3837.4
okay

3839.76 --> 3843.5200000000004
i mean there's other categories out

3842.0 --> 3846.4
there you know where you have similar

3843.52 --> 3848.24
similar problems i mean there's a whole

3846.4 --> 3852.1600000000003
religion

3848.24 --> 3854.16
that really doesn't like it

3852.16 --> 3857.52
right that really doesn't like a very

3854.16 --> 3860.24
specific set of words

3857.52 --> 3862.48
and they like really make issue on like

3860.24 --> 3864.5589999999997
shaming that and all that what's it

3862.48 --> 3865.68
called again oh yeah

3864.559 --> 3867.52
the words

3865.68 --> 3868.48
jesus christ

3867.52 --> 3871.119
yeah

3868.48 --> 3873.92
i mean maybe we should just not call

3871.119 --> 3875.359
ourselves like followers of jesus christ

3873.92 --> 3876.559
we shouldn't invoke on that name because

3875.359 --> 3879.119
there's this

3876.559 --> 3880.88
huge group of people right now that are

3879.119 --> 3883.76
very active

3880.88 --> 3886.6400000000003
that really don't like those words yeah

3883.76 --> 3888.559
it's such a good reason to then change

3886.64 --> 3891.0389999999998
it right i mean

3888.559 --> 3893.8390000000004
everybody objecting is always like the

3891.039 --> 3896.7200000000003
good reason to change something the

3893.839 --> 3899.2
appearance of it the cloak it right you

3896.72 --> 3901.359
need to cloak something that's true or

3899.2 --> 3903.9199999999996
does that simply mean you're a coward

3901.359 --> 3905.92
and you're retreating

3903.92 --> 3909.28
you're defacing that which you

3905.92 --> 3911.839
supposedly champion

3909.28 --> 3913.599
yeah think about that

3911.839 --> 3916.0789999999997
i'm not gonna do that

3913.599 --> 3918.96
i'm gonna call it flat earth

3916.079 --> 3921.8390000000004
i'm gonna call it jesus christ

3918.96 --> 3924.559
and i don't give a [ __ ]

3921.839 --> 3927.44
if the vast majority doesn't like it

3924.559 --> 3929.28
doesn't agree or even if they did agree

3927.44 --> 3932.839
it doesn't matter to me because i'm just

3929.28 --> 3932.8390000000004
gonna do it

3942.24 --> 3945.24
ugh

3971.44 --> 3974.96
yeah talking about which

3975.119 --> 3979.839
that reminds me man

3977.52 --> 3982.64
there were these scenes

3979.839 --> 3985.2
in the he-man weird series thing

3982.64 --> 3987.92
miniseries thing

3985.2 --> 3987.9199999999996
that were like

3988.319 --> 3994.0
quite surreal

3990.72 --> 3995.2
like really surreal and they were like

3994.0 --> 4000.0
even

3995.2 --> 4000.0
like skeletor was gonna introduce like

4000.44 --> 4005.28
heliocentrist atheism

4003.76 --> 4007.5200000000004
it's like that's

4005.28 --> 4009.76
like at some point they like get

4007.52 --> 4012.319
their hands on like the ultimate power

4009.76 --> 4015.3590000000004
and it's pretty serious and like

4012.319 --> 4017.2
like really dramatic things happen if

4015.359 --> 4019.119
like for the he-man franchise that's

4017.2 --> 4021.839
like what the [ __ ]

4019.119 --> 4025.28
that's rough man it's like almost

4021.839 --> 4028.16
marvel style extremities

4025.28 --> 4031.52
right super like real

4028.16 --> 4033.1189999999997
gauntlet of might type of [ __ ]

4031.52 --> 4035.44
and

4033.119 --> 4036.559
the things they set there and how it all

4035.44 --> 4039.119
like

4036.559 --> 4041.92
i'm still puzzled by what i saw

4039.119 --> 4041.92
yesterday

4042.64 --> 4046.319
i'm still puzzled by it

4047.28 --> 4050.88
like a couple of scenes they're like

4049.2 --> 4052.5589999999997
review worthy

4050.88 --> 4055.119
they're like

4052.559 --> 4057.8390000000004
i'd like almost like hey matt quantum of

4055.119 --> 4058.6400000000003
conscious have you checked this

4057.839 --> 4061.68
dude

4058.64 --> 4064.0
you should like review these

4061.68 --> 4066.24
two episodes

4064.0 --> 4068.48
of that series in reflection to

4066.24 --> 4071.359
everything else to like the previous

4068.48 --> 4073.52
he-man and to like the world and like

4071.359 --> 4075.2799999999997
spiritual ascension and the awakening

4073.52 --> 4077.359
and everything

4075.28 --> 4080.3190000000004
this is like one of those things that he

4077.359 --> 4083.52
would like totally

4080.319 --> 4085.599
like show every single amazing point

4083.52 --> 4086.48
about it i think because it was like

4085.599 --> 4088.88
whoa

4086.48 --> 4091.119
what the [ __ ] that's not something i

4088.88 --> 4094.0
expected out of the freaking e-man

4091.119 --> 4095.6800000000003
miniseries yeah

4094.0 --> 4098.319
ah

4095.68 --> 4100.4
right i don't know why i brought this up

4098.319 --> 4103.96
maybe it just

4100.4 --> 4103.96
needed to deflect

4104.0 --> 4109.44

i mean i am pretty good at cooking and i

4118.56 --> 4123.759

on camera at some point but it's not

4123.759 --> 4127.199

food it's i've only made it for one week

4134.239 --> 4138.159
for the first time ever and now i have

4136.239 --> 4138.959999999999
to make something new

4138.159 --> 4141.839
no

4138.96 --> 4147.04
no i like to make a meal and then eat it

4141.839 --> 4150.0
like 10 000 times again over my life

4147.04 --> 4153.199
and perfect it just slightly

4150.0 --> 4155.199
to absolute personal perfection that's

4153.199 --> 4157.839
how i cook i'm not like this guy that's

4155.199 --> 4161.44
constantly like oh i'm bored i have to

4157.839 --> 4162.3189999999995
figure out something new no

4161.44 --> 4164.5599999999995
no

4162.319 --> 4164.56
no

4169.92 --> 4174.88
i mean even if i'm if i'm gonna do

4172.08 --> 4177.199
things like that i'm i've just chosen to

4174.88 --> 4178.56
really oversimplify so it's like chicken

4177.199 --> 4180.2789999999995
broccoli

4178.56 --> 4184.400000000001
yeah that's my

4180.279 --> 4187.279
revolutionary new type of meal

4184.4 --> 4188.96
chicken broccoli

4187.279 --> 4192.64
chicken wings

4188.96 --> 4195.28
with salt pepper rosemary

4192.64 --> 4198.08
and broccoli sticks on the side that's

4195.28 --> 4199.36
it oh yeah in butter by the way

4198.08 --> 4201.679
the chicken

4199.36 --> 4202.799999999999
that's it that's like my revolutionary

4201.679 --> 4206.08
cooking

4202.8 --> 4208.4800000000005
i mean it's super simple

4206.08 --> 4210.719
it's very tasty

4208.48 --> 4213.718999999999
is that really worth a cooking show

4210.719 --> 4213.719
nah

4216.88 --> 4222.159000000001
yes borders boy i've heard about that

4219.12 --> 4222.159
really gross

4223.84 --> 4227.92
as far as i'm concerned they should

4225.52 --> 4229.280000000001
catch the guy

4227.92 --> 4232.4
put him

4229.28 --> 4236.0
on the square on a pile of wood

4232.4 --> 4238.08
and then freaking roast him alive

4236.0 --> 4241.8
that's my advice to them that's what you

4238.08 --> 4241.8
should do with that guy

4250.0 --> 4254.96
yeah that doesn't really sound very good

4251.76 --> 4254.96
now does it jeffy acid

4258.159 --> 4263.92
yeah that's it was [ __ ] up

4261.84 --> 4265.06

4263.92 --> 4267.6

[Music]

4267.6 --> 4272.719

4270.08 --> 4274.6

4272.719 --> 4277.52
they're so

4274.6 --> 4280.4800000000005
unbelievably brutally punished

4277.52 --> 4282.2390000000005
that like anybody that could ever even

4280.48 --> 4284.32
get an inkling of thought of doing

4282.239 --> 4287.599999999999
something like that again just can't

4284.32 --> 4292.5599999999995
because they know they're gonna suffer

4287.6 --> 4292.56
the most horrific death imaginable

4293.36 --> 4297.839999999999
he meant your chicken i know godzilla i

4295.36 --> 4297.839999999999

4323.3 --> 4328.08
[Music]

4325.04 --> 4331.44
is what you should do

4328.08 --> 4333.84

4331.44 --> 4337.199
specifically wanting to the face that

4333.84 --> 4338.64

4337.199 --> 4340.0
put him

4338.64 --> 4343.1990000000005
fired

4340.0 --> 4346.0
and have him roasted alive

4343.199 --> 4348.48
where everybody can see it and a camera

4346.0 --> 4351.6
on it for reference

4348.48 --> 4351.599999999999
that's what you should do

4357.199 --> 4360.799999999999
and hey somebody's like oh i'm gonna do

4359.76 --> 4363.1990000000005

i'm a freaking certainly looking at my

4363.199 --> 4367.36

4419.36 --> 4425.44
this is about basic repellent

4423.28 --> 4428.88
basic repellent

4425.44 --> 4431.199
somebody has absolutely no limiter

4428.88 --> 4433.52
on their psychosis and they will act it

4431.199 --> 4434.96
out and they will just slaughter people

4433.52 --> 4439.88
like demons

4434.96 --> 4439.88
then you need to counter measure that

4448.719 --> 4452.4800000000005
yeah that's indeed exactly what

4451.199 --> 4455.199
and look

mass murdering people like that

4475.76 --> 4480.56

there's just no question no question

4480.56 --> 4485.84
immediately

4482.4 --> 4490.32
the worst imaginable

4485.84 --> 4493.28
public not secret public

4490.32 --> 4495.679

what happens

4495.679 --> 4500.4
to anybody that might get any kind of

4497.92 --> 4503.92
idea like that in the future show them

4500.4 --> 4503.92

i i really hope they got some people

4558.239 --> 4563.759999999999
among their christian communities that

4560.239 --> 4565.678999999999
aren't just [ __ ] wussies

4563.76 --> 4568.1990000000005
that are very serious and that are going

4565.679 --> 4571.6
to actually make work of this not

4568.199 --> 4574.4
reciprocate but like really get these

4571.6 --> 4574.400000000001
[ __ ] eyes

4576.4 --> 4580.04
really get them

4602.88 --> 4609.0
yeah flatter society is control

4604.88 --> 4609.0
operation very sloppily

4609.04 --> 4614.159
controlled opposition that was like

4611.52 --> 4615.120000000001
highly overestimated how

4614.159 --> 4618.719
like

4615.12 --> 4621.599999999999
dude the past planners have not

4618.719 --> 4623.52
been able to properly size up how the

4621.6 --> 4624.8
awakening would influence and change

4623.52 --> 4628.8
things i already addressed this

4624.8 --> 4628.8
yesterday in stance this stance

4630.4 --> 4637.5199999999995
they highly underestimated it

4633.6 --> 4641.4400000000005
flatter society was clearly aimed

4637.52 --> 4642.320000000001
at like a dumber crowd

4641.44 --> 4644.4
we've

4642.32 --> 4646.96
bypassed them they are no longer

4644.4 --> 4648.799999999999
effective at gatekeeping flat earth they

4646.96 --> 4651.199
aren't they really aren't even though

4648.8 --> 4655.52
there's used as primary

4651.199 --> 4657.5199999999995
straw man examples by the mainstream

4655.52 --> 4660.400000000001
right they're used on purpose and it

4657.52 --> 4663.400000000001
doesn't work anymore it just doesn't

4660.4 --> 4663.4
work

4665.92 --> 4670.159
they've worked to some degree in like

4668.0 --> 4674.8
the 90s

4670.159 --> 4676.5599999999995
maybe even into the new millennia but

4674.8 --> 4678.88
like as soon as that

4676.56 --> 4681.1990000000005
flat earth awakening started really

4678.88 --> 4684.2390000000005
rolling is it was just like

4681.199 --> 4686.5599999999995
totally sweat swiped off the map it was

4684.239 --> 4689.599999999999
just completely useless now everybody

4686.56 --> 4689.6
can see right through it

4691.12 --> 4696.159
and they're based like people there are

4692.719 --> 4698.32
basically admitting it they're just like

4696.159 --> 4700.879999999999
admitting

4698.32 --> 4702.239
like yeah we we think it's all kind of

4700.88 --> 4703.6
nonsense

4702.239 --> 4707.4
this yeah

4703.6 --> 4707.400000000001
what we're about

4708.32 --> 4711.759999999999
so

4710.48 --> 4713.599999999999
yeah

4711.76 --> 4715.84
well there's an alternative to that

4713.6 --> 4717.280000000001
there's people that do actually believe

4715.84 --> 4719.4400000000005
what they're doing

4717.28 --> 4720.4
and they do actually do real research

4719.44 --> 4723.759999999999
and they do

4720.4 --> 4726.799999999999
have critical thinking developments

4723.76 --> 4731.320000000001
and yeah so goodbye flatter society

4726.8 --> 4731.320000000001
you're completely useless now

4742.0 --> 4748.679
they were innovators [ __ ] rufus and

4744.56 --> 4748.679
hobbins they were not innovators

4751.92 --> 4756.4800000000005
and they have bad rap because they

4754.08 --> 4760.73
deserve a bad rap their control

4756.48 --> 4763.959999999999
opposition on purpose

4760.73 --> 4763.959999999999
[Music]

4766.0 --> 4770.96
where's the forum for open one no no it

4768.8 --> 4776.04
isn't that's just the

4770.96 --> 4776.04
excuse label they put on it

4777.28 --> 4781.04
it's controlled opposition

4782.96 --> 4787.84
right they're there to catch off

4785.36 --> 4789.04
interested newcomer potential flat

4787.84 --> 4791.6
earthers

4789.04 --> 4792.48
then kind them like shake them around a

4791.6 --> 4794.64
bit

4792.48 --> 4796.639999999999
until they're no longer interested and

4794.64 --> 4797.6
then they go away that's what they're

4796.64 --> 4800.0
doing

4797.6 --> 4804.8
yeah not for the oh yeah they're for the

4800.0 --> 4807.199
open-minded in order to close that gap

4804.8 --> 4809.52
yeah that's how they're for the open

4807.199 --> 4812.48
mind oh come in open-minded

4809.52 --> 4814.400000000001
see you later or not later now

4812.48 --> 4816.0
closed-minded person that lost all

4814.4 --> 4819.28
interest in flat earth because we made

4816.0 --> 4821.6
it look ridiculous for you yeah

4819.28 --> 4821.599999999999
i mean

4821.76 --> 4828.76
yeah they got a bad rap because they

4823.92 --> 4828.76
suck and their control opposition

4836.71 --> 4843.799
[Music]

4861.04 --> 4865.96
and what i'm seeing so what are you

4862.639 --> 4865.96
talking about

4907.23 --> 4917.299
[Music]

4926.45 --> 4929.62
[Music]

4940.159 --> 4945.839999999999

4942.639 --> 4945.84
yes that's not okay

4946.14 --> 4957.479
[Music]

4960.71 --> 4968.4
[Music]

4967.28 --> 4972.0
wow

4968.4 --> 4974.638999999999
did you seen it yeah that

4972.0 --> 4976.719
i'm not surprised

4974.639 --> 4979.36
i mean you can't say space isn't real

4976.719 --> 4982.159
that that's that's gonna ruin everything

4979.36 --> 4984.5599999999995
i mean you gotta have your space right

4982.159 --> 4987.839999999999
literally they want their

4984.56 --> 4990.56
safe space

4987.84 --> 4993.360000000001
right they want that infinite amount of

4990.56 --> 4994.2390000000005
room that they have in their imagination

4993.36 --> 4995.839999999999
and

4994.239 --> 4999.599999999999
and then it's like yeah you can have

4995.84 --> 5002.4800000000005
your desk in that infinite base

4999.6 --> 5005.1990000000005
little disky

5002.48 --> 5007.04
that's logical right don't question

5005.199 --> 5010.08
space though

5007.04 --> 5010.08
has to be there

5010.719 --> 5016.639
i mean otherwise everything would make

5013.28 --> 5018.639
no sense that you've been seeing

5016.639 --> 5021.36
right i mean

5018.639 --> 5024.639
it's just the ball that's wrong it's

5021.36 --> 5025.599999999999
just a disc in space

5024.639 --> 5028.0
yes

5025.6 --> 5030.400000000001
that's like the only thing they lied

5028.0 --> 5031.92
about

5030.4 --> 5032.719
right not

5031.92 --> 5034.96
just

5032.719 --> 5037.199
the entire field of astronomy and

5034.96 --> 5039.84
astrophysics

5037.199 --> 5042.159
literally conjuring up a fictional

5039.84 --> 5044.8
medium and then

5042.159 --> 5047.12
claiming things about what they think is

5044.8 --> 5048.56
happening in that fictional medium i

5047.12 --> 5050.5599999999995
mean

5048.56 --> 5053.1990000000005
letter society is not going to poke a

5050.56 --> 5057.360000000001
stick at that

5053.199 --> 5059.919999999999
that would violate their contract

5057.36 --> 5059.92
probably

5061.679 --> 5065.28
i don't even know if they have contracts

5063.679 --> 5068.84
i don't know what i'm saying

5065.28 --> 5068.84
you know what i mean

5070.159 --> 5073.879999999999
all right see you later godzilla

5092.18 --> 5098.649
[Music]

5103.18 --> 5107.54
[Music]

5111.52 --> 5115.52
never once come across them directly

5113.92 --> 5118.32
yeah well because they're not by now

5115.52 --> 5121.280000000001
they're like super outnumbered so

5118.32 --> 5123.44
i mean flair society doesn't really do

5121.28 --> 5124.639
anything anymore

5123.44 --> 5126.32
it's

5124.639 --> 5127.1990000000005
i don't think it's gonna last like

5126.32 --> 5130.08
another

5127.199 --> 5133.44
10 years it's probably just gonna like

5130.08 --> 5133.44
this band at some point

5136.08 --> 5140.96
or maybe there they'll just be a forum

5139.12 --> 5143.28
somewhere on the internet that nobody

5140.96 --> 5144.56
really gives a [ __ ] about

5143.28 --> 5147.92
like that

5144.56 --> 5150.400000000001
right because they're outnumbered

5147.92 --> 5153.04
we don't need

5150.4 --> 5155.04
a flatter society

5153.04 --> 5157.44
we don't need that

5155.04 --> 5159.5199999999995
organization

5157.44 --> 5162.159
the amount of flat earthers actively

5159.52 --> 5164.159000000001
doing their own work

5162.159 --> 5167.5199999999995
organizing

5164.159 --> 5168.48
it's like fastly outnumbered the flatter

5167.52 --> 5170.639
society

5168.48 --> 5173.04
people vastly

5170.639 --> 5175.36
so it's just doesn't do anything anymore

5173.04 --> 5175.36
really

5181.199 --> 5185.44
weren't they mentioned again in the most

5182.88 --> 5186.96
recent level yeah

5185.44 --> 5189.199
well

5186.96 --> 5191.84
look if you're gonna have a mainstream

5189.199 --> 5193.839999999999
type of movie or if you're gonna try to

5191.84 --> 5196.4800000000005
aim for a wider crowd

5193.84 --> 5198.719
a lot of people that have really not

5196.48 --> 5201.04
heard a lot about flat earth

5198.719 --> 5203.12
are very likely to have heard about the

5201.04 --> 5205.84
flatter society right

5203.12 --> 5207.679
if you're a normie glober and you don't

5205.84 --> 5211.12
know anything

5207.679 --> 5213.04
you're probably if somehow faced

5211.12 --> 5215.12
something about flat earth

5213.04 --> 5218.96
somebody might just bring up flatter

5215.12 --> 5220.8
society like as a joke or something or

5218.96 --> 5223.44
right

5220.8 --> 5226.8
that happened in the past so it is still

5223.44 --> 5229.599999999999
like a thing that normies

5226.8 --> 5232.320000000001
are more likely to have heard about and

5229.6 --> 5234.96
that's why i think they like to bring it

5232.32 --> 5236.239
up also

5234.96 --> 5238.719
when yeah

5236.239 --> 5241.04
making a documentary films that are

5238.719 --> 5242.63
really aiming for a bigger crowd

5241.04 --> 5250.229
only makes sense

5242.63 --> 5250.229
[Music]

5250.639 --> 5254.719
all right and that they're effectively

5252.159 --> 5256.32
irrelevant at this point is not relevant

5254.719 --> 5258.56
because if you're going to aim for a

5256.32 --> 5260.799999999999
wider crowd you're not going to

5258.56 --> 5263.120000000001
force like all the higher drawn

5260.8 --> 5265.1990000000005
conclusions from a long-term focused

5263.12 --> 5267.12
flat earther

5265.199 --> 5269.36
you're not going to just pile that on

5267.12 --> 5271.199
the normies

5269.36 --> 5273.839999999999
you're going to have to like work them

5271.199 --> 5275.759999999999
in carefully gradually because there's a

5273.84 --> 5277.84
lot of like confusion and shocking

5275.76 --> 5280.0
moments you can't just like

5277.84 --> 5281.6
ram it all on there all at once it

5280.0 --> 5284.6
doesn't work like that

5281.6 --> 5284.6
so

5290.12 --> 5293.29
[Music]

5296.88 --> 5300.96
yeah fair enough point bob will eat

5299.199 --> 5302.4
itself yeah

5300.96 --> 5304.639
if you mention it

5302.4 --> 5307.879999999999
you are keeping them relevant yeah that

5304.639 --> 5307.88
is true

5311.52 --> 5315.360000000001
but maybe it would be worth it as an

5314.159 --> 5318.48
example

5315.36 --> 5320.48
i mean if you're already like watching

5318.48 --> 5322.638999999999
a flat earther

5320.48 --> 5324.32
movie getting into their channels and

5322.639 --> 5326.4800000000005
watching more of that

5324.32 --> 5328.32
how likely is it that you're actually

5326.48 --> 5330.08
gonna look up the flatter society at

5328.32 --> 5332.719
that point i mean

5330.08 --> 5335.76
you don't need to

5332.719 --> 5338.4
you don't need to do that to get to this

5335.76 --> 5340.56
flat earth information you're so curious

5338.4 --> 5342.799999999999
to you don't need to do that

5340.56 --> 5344.56
right so to have it just mentioned on

5342.8 --> 5346.2390000000005
the side

5344.56 --> 5350.52
really isn't that much of an

5346.239 --> 5350.5199999999995
advertisement for them even

5351.04 --> 5355.44
yes it keeps them somewhat in the

5353.679 --> 5358.56
attention but what are people going to

5355.44 --> 5358.5599999999995
do with it right

5358.639 --> 5364.8
flatter society is not the go-to corner

5362.0 --> 5368.88
for flat earth learning and everybody

5364.8 --> 5368.88
knows that so it just doesn't work

5373.22 --> 5377.12
[Music]

5374.719 --> 5378.88
right the only reason at this point for

5377.12 --> 5382.0
flat earthers or whatever to even go

5378.88 --> 5383.6
there is just to check out what is there

5382.0 --> 5386.0
how the people are and what they're

5383.6 --> 5386.0
doing

5386.48 --> 5391.28
you're not gonna go there to learn about

5388.56 --> 5392.56
flat earth if you know what i mean

5391.28 --> 5394.159
right

5392.56 --> 5395.490000000001
so how are they going to gatekeep that

5394.159 --> 5397.5199999999995
they're not really

5395.49 --> 5399.5199999999995
[Music]

5397.52 --> 5401.6
they can only gatekeep people if

5399.52 --> 5404.84
everybody thinks that they're the only

5401.6 --> 5408.0
flat earthers or something

5404.84 --> 5410.4800000000005
then can they fulfill

5408.0 --> 5412.719
such a straw man function and this is p

5410.48 --> 5414.32
people just no no there's the other flat

5412.719 --> 5416.639
earth like

5414.32 --> 5419.28
mark sergeant and david weiss and all

5416.639 --> 5422.0
these people yeah that who's giving a

5419.28 --> 5424.639
[ __ ] about flatter society after that

5422.0 --> 5427.639
right it becomes completely

5424.639 --> 5427.639
irrelevant

5434.93 --> 5439.069
[Music]

5444.56 --> 5450.0
yeah flat sabbath could you please not

5448.0 --> 5453.28
use all caps

5450.0 --> 5453.28
in my chat thank you

5456.4 --> 5461.96
oh man time has flown i can't believe it

5468.8 --> 5475.859
man this show went by fast

5471.72 --> 5475.859
[Music]

5481.36 --> 5486.719
there is no earthy authority oh yes

5483.679 --> 5489.4400000000005
because we need an authority

5486.719 --> 5491.12
i mean we can't think for ourselves we

5489.44 --> 5495.04
need the leader

5491.12 --> 5497.36
new leader to tell us what to do leader

5495.04 --> 5501.6
come on

5497.36 --> 5507.199
i can decide for myself what to do

5501.6 --> 5507.1990000000005
we need a leader a leader i tell you

5508.239 --> 5511.799999999999
no not really

5522.08 --> 5526.08
i don't need a leader in flat earth and

5524.0 --> 5527.36
i don't need a representative in flat

5526.08 --> 5528.719
earth

5527.36 --> 5531.5199999999995
although i

5528.719 --> 5534.4800000000005
would have more preference for

5531.52 --> 5536.2390000000005
certain people to represent flat earth

5534.48 --> 5538.0
arguments

5536.239 --> 5541.199
over others

5538.0 --> 5542.32
and it doesn't make them more leader

5541.199 --> 5544.159
okay

5542.32 --> 5546.639
it just makes them somebody that i

5544.159 --> 5548.0
really trusted like

5546.639 --> 5550.2390000000005
share

5548.0 --> 5552.88
information on a level that is very

5550.239 --> 5553.759999999999
close to my own which would help

5552.88 --> 5557.36
me

5553.76 --> 5559.04
make me more understood by

5557.36 --> 5560.799999999999
outsiders

5559.04 --> 5562.8
it's all functional

5560.8 --> 5565.12
it's not leadership

5562.8 --> 5566.159000000001
i don't need anybody to tell me what to

5565.12 --> 5568.239
do

5566.159 --> 5570.08
i'll figure that out by myself and

5568.239 --> 5571.839999999999
somebody could like tell me what to do

5570.08 --> 5574.0
but that doesn't mean i'm going to do it

5571.84 --> 5575.6
it just means that i'm gonna take note

5574.0 --> 5577.6
of that they said that and figure out

5575.6 --> 5579.6
why they said that and then figure out

5577.6 --> 5582.96
whether they have a point to that

5579.6 --> 5585.1990000000005
and then decide whether i choose to do

5582.96 --> 5586.84
it or not

5585.199 --> 5591.599999999999
yeah that's

5586.84 --> 5591.6
called leadership over yourself

5599.36 --> 5603.839999999999
that's right

5601.679 --> 5606.0
eat the meat spit out the bones so you

5603.84 --> 5607.4400000000005
can start water as nathan oakley likes

5606.0 --> 5611.36
to say

5607.44 --> 5611.36
i think it's a really important saying

5612.639 --> 5615.639
uh

5635.92 --> 5640.88
ah oh cool ben white yeah quantum of

5638.8 --> 5643.28
conscious is pretty

5640.88 --> 5645.6
pretty amazing isn't it

5643.28 --> 5647.36
i mean i don't like every video he's

5645.6 --> 5650.2390000000005
ever done

5647.36 --> 5655.159
but some of them are just like

5650.239 --> 5655.159
like what he does he does well

5659.6 --> 5665.52
and by now he's like very widely known

5662.48 --> 5667.28
also right like people

5665.52 --> 5669.52
there's a lot of people that actually

5667.28 --> 5670.96
pick up on what he talks about

5669.52 --> 5674.320000000001
out there

5670.96 --> 5676.4800000000005
which almost makes it valuable by itself

5674.32 --> 5678.159
see is good and there is a lot of people

5676.48 --> 5680.239
watching so it's like

5678.159 --> 5683.199
you watch it

5680.239 --> 5686.879999999999
it'll help you understand everything and

5683.199 --> 5690.159
other people better

5686.88 --> 5692.88
it has with me i hope to kind of do that

5690.159 --> 5694.48
myself i don't know how effective i am

5692.88 --> 5695.36
at that

5694.48 --> 5696.799999999999
but

5695.36 --> 5700.28
yeah

5696.8 --> 5700.28
i do my best

5700.88 --> 5704.4800000000005
but i'm glad you're enjoying the channel

5710.639 --> 5714.0
right

5711.52 --> 5716.8
but don't take like everything he says

5714.0 --> 5720.159
for granted or by the way

5716.8 --> 5723.28
and he's still a human being he still

5720.159 --> 5724.48
has he has a very specific way of doing

5723.28 --> 5728.239
things

5724.48 --> 5731.28
and i don't agree with all of it

5728.239 --> 5733.5199999999995
but he is consistent

5731.28 --> 5735.84
that's very important right you don't

5733.52 --> 5739.1990000000005
have to agree with everything but yeah

5735.84 --> 5743.84
pick up on the consistency at least

5739.199 --> 5743.839999999999
and then yeah reflect over over time

5751.76 --> 5756.159000000001
yeah by the way also his comment section

5754.0 --> 5757.76
is great he gets a lot of really good

5756.159 --> 5762.08
comments from people

5757.76 --> 5762.08
i do my best sometimes to say something

5762.32 --> 5766.0
relevant

5764.159 --> 5767.36
but yeah i don't really make a habit of

5766.0 --> 5768.88
always commenting there but he has

5767.36 --> 5770.639
really good commentaries i'm kind of

5768.88 --> 5774.8
jealous

5770.639 --> 5774.8
because i mostly just get the trolls

5775.36 --> 5781.5599999999995
oh i do get some nice comments here and

5777.36 --> 5781.5599999999995
there i do appreciate those

5812.4 --> 5815.759999999999
yep

5813.36 --> 5815.759999999999
anyway

5817.119 --> 5820.96
i think i'm gonna round out the show

5822.239 --> 5825.239
hungry

5826.0 --> 5831.1
all right

5828.03 --> 5831.099999999999
[Music]

5845.92 --> 5849.92
did you know youtube has actively

5847.44 --> 5851.5199999999995
refused to promote anyone associated

5849.92 --> 5853.4400000000005
with fe

5851.52 --> 5856.2390000000005
[Music]

5853.44 --> 5858.638999999999
not entirely ben white it's complicated

5856.239 --> 5860.48
well it's not that complicated but it is

5858.639 --> 5863.28
very specific

5860.48 --> 5863.28
the gatekeep

5863.52 --> 5869.1990000000005
right what they do is they don't suggest

5867.28 --> 5870.159
flat earth

5869.199 --> 5872.719
to

5870.159 --> 5875.759999999999
people that don't go and look it up for

5872.719 --> 5878.4800000000005
themselves right that's how they do it

5875.76 --> 5880.0
so if you are into flat earth you will

5878.48 --> 5881.678999999999
be able to find

5880.0 --> 5882.719
other flat earthers

5881.679 --> 5884.88
right

5882.719 --> 5887.679
but if you've never heard of it then

5884.88 --> 5890.159000000001
youtube will make sure that it stays

5887.679 --> 5892.08
that way that's how they work

5890.159 --> 5894.08
right so they don't like it's not like

5892.08 --> 5896.0
oh but i want to really find this flat

5894.08 --> 5897.04
earther then youtube's gonna be okay

5896.0 --> 5898.239
okay

5897.04 --> 5900.96
there

5898.239 --> 5903.678999999999
but look at this list of trolls are you

5900.96 --> 5905.119
sure you really want to find it

5903.679 --> 5907.36
right

5905.119 --> 5909.199
but yeah if you do actually find it and

5907.36 --> 5911.599999999999
you do sub to the right channel that

5909.199 --> 5914.08
actually is a decent flat earther then

5911.6 --> 5917.360000000001
eventually it's going to be like oh [ __ ]

5914.08 --> 5919.679
we lost this one to flat earth oh well

5917.36 --> 5920.48
and then they take off that gatekeeping

5919.679 --> 5922.8
lock

5920.48 --> 5926.599999999999
because it doesn't work anymore

5922.8 --> 5926.6

5943.6 --> 5945.84
what

5946.08 --> 5951.32
i don't know what you're talking about

5948.32 --> 5951.32

5996.32 --> 6001.239
definitely over the target with that one

6008.719 --> 6011.92
wow

6010.4 --> 6014.32
ironic

6011.92 --> 6017.679
that star wars can use the word dirk

6014.32 --> 6019.119
around with self words well yeah yeah

6017.679 --> 6021.1990000000005
she can

6019.119 --> 6022.88
i think derp is a very decent

6021.199 --> 6025.759999999999
description

6022.88 --> 6027.6
for the mental activities that typically

6025.76 --> 6030.08
accompany

6027.6 --> 6032.56
the people that are well

6030.08 --> 6035.04
that we get derp alerts for

6032.56 --> 6037.92
from seeking stillwater

6035.04 --> 6039.44
yeah so yeah you could try to guess like

6037.92 --> 6043.119
oh that's so

6039.44 --> 6044.4
you saying derp but you're secretly the

6043.119 --> 6045.679
derp

6044.4 --> 6046.96

no

6046.96 --> 6051.199
papa

6053.28 --> 6057.36
no seeking star wars can definitely

6055.6 --> 6061.04
declare dirt

6057.36 --> 6063.759999999999
she has the sensibility for it

6061.04 --> 6066.96
and you're not gonna successfully

6063.76 --> 6069.1990000000005
gaslight her into stop saying that

6066.96 --> 6069.199

6074.8 --> 6080.4800000000005
helpful to me
