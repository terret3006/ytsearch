membership system join button

75.52 --> 79.03999999999999
that would be much appreciated

80.159 --> 86.159
so the weather today is different

83.68 --> 88.0
kind of looks the same on the surface

86.159 --> 89.52000000000001
but it's actually a lot warmer in it

88.0 --> 92.079
right now

89.52 --> 93.2
than it was yesterday especially the day

92.079 --> 99.91999999999999
before

93.2 --> 101.119
it's still kind of a gray soup up there

99.92 --> 105.119
and yeah it's

101.119 --> 105.119
like slightly misty in the

113.68 --> 115.84
all distance

119.1 --> 123.85
[Music]

126.84 --> 134.72
so

128.08 --> 134.72
thursday the 4th of february 2021

134.959 --> 138.879
all right and good morning to you here

137.68 --> 143.84
we go again

138.879 --> 143.84
who's first in chat

145.76 --> 152.48
my u2 is way behind again

149.76 --> 152.48
right so

154.84 --> 161.12
yeah yesterday's show

157.36 --> 163.519
was pretty good i don't think i watched

161.12 --> 163.519
it back

164.16 --> 171.04
i managed to keep my composure

167.84 --> 174.239
throughout the entire show even with

171.04 --> 177.76
even opening up the chat because i did

174.239 --> 177.76
members only the first half

180.159 --> 186.879
so yeah whatever ailed me two days ago

184.08 --> 189.12
it seems like that part is over for a

186.879 --> 189.12
bit

191.2 --> 194.79999999999998
hello mellow fellow

197.28 --> 201.36
all right so yesterday overall flat

200.4 --> 206.08
earth debates

201.36 --> 208.48000000000002
was pretty good very long

206.08 --> 210.56
because i uh yeah stayed for this show

208.48 --> 211.599
pretty much then went for groceries when

210.56 --> 215.92000000000002
i got back

211.599 --> 221.28
it was still going so that that's always

215.92 --> 221.28
those are that's always fun to get back

222.319 --> 228.159
uh yeah they're also currently working

225.519 --> 230.56
on continuing like the ramp to the

228.159 --> 232.56
bridge they're

230.56 --> 234.319
they're building something over there in

232.56 --> 236.56
front of the bridge

234.319 --> 238.0
so it's probably to enhance the ramp

236.56 --> 239.519
towards it

238.0 --> 241.84
that might be making some noise in the

239.519 --> 241.84
distance

243.04 --> 251.2
i'll try not to let it bother me

246.08 --> 251.20000000000002
but yeah yesterday was pretty good day

251.36 --> 256.0
uh in the evening i had a very long

254.0 --> 258.479
phone call again with my friend and i

256.0 --> 258.479
made her

261.919 --> 269.84
and yeah that was good it's basically

267.44 --> 269.84
like

270.8 --> 274.8
explain how do you even define these

273.199 --> 277.52000000000004
things just like

274.8 --> 278.479
how we respond to situations in the

277.52 --> 280.88
world

278.479 --> 282.0
she has very similar impulses to mine in

280.88 --> 285.199
ways that's also

282.0 --> 288.8
kind of like why we're friends

285.199 --> 288.8
we understand each other really well

289.36 --> 296.72
and yeah i have some minor

293.52 --> 300.96
issues predicaments that i get in

296.72 --> 303.28000000000003
she also but from a different angle

300.96 --> 303.28
and

304.4 --> 309.75899999999996
just discussing things and discussing

307.6 --> 313.36
the future

309.759 --> 313.36
like what are we gonna do with all this

313.919 --> 320.32
and for her especially it's

317.28 --> 323.52
also a matter of

320.32 --> 325.039
kind of letting go because she's always

323.52 --> 327.44
had the attitude of like

325.039 --> 329.68
everyone means well and everyone is a

327.44 --> 334.24
good person

329.68 --> 337.12
and like this automatic humbleness

334.24 --> 337.68
which has been extremely inconvenient

337.12 --> 341.199
because

337.68 --> 341.199
a lot of people for some reason

342.08 --> 347.19899999999996
that she's forced to deal with like tend

344.72 --> 350.639
to totally abuse that and not really

347.199 --> 353.28000000000003
respect or help her out

350.639 --> 355.6
so yeah i've been kind of like trying to

353.28 --> 358.63899999999995
make her a little bit more strict

355.6 --> 363.28000000000003
just tell her like no

358.639 --> 365.919
just be like a demanding

363.28 --> 366.79999999999995
strict mother not necessarily towards

365.919 --> 368.79999999999995
the kid

366.8 --> 370.88
even though she'll probably be able to

368.8 --> 375.44
use that too

370.88 --> 380.24
getting very rebellious at a young age

375.44 --> 383.36
but against just other people

380.24 --> 384.479
because otherwise yeah she's she just

383.36 --> 388.08000000000004
has to claim

384.479 --> 390.479
her own authority as it were

388.08 --> 392.4
kind of to force people to take her more

390.479 --> 395.75899999999996
serious

392.4 --> 399.44
and she's been working on that

395.759 --> 403.039
and doing great so yeah that's about it

399.44 --> 403.039
what i'm gonna say about that

403.28 --> 408.23999999999995
it's been great conversation with her

407.919 --> 409.84
like

408.24 --> 413.52
three hours on the phone it's always

409.84 --> 413.52
that long every single time

414.0 --> 419.44
right and beside that just watching

416.479 --> 419.44
south park again

421.12 --> 425.84000000000003
i went to bed a little early for my

424.479 --> 428.31899999999996
doing anyway

425.84 --> 430.23999999999995
thus i also mislift the veil completely

428.319 --> 432.24
because of that

430.24 --> 434.639
because i like lift watching lift the

432.24 --> 437.039
veil but it's always so late

434.639 --> 439.12
for my for my time it's like after two

437.039 --> 441.52
o'clock at night

439.12 --> 443.199
and this time i kind of went to bed

441.52 --> 445.44
around that time

443.199 --> 448.88
just very early also because the

445.44 --> 448.88
internet kind of just broke

449.199 --> 453.68
like the connection or not even the

451.44 --> 457.52
connection between

453.68 --> 459.199
my internet connection towards the modem

457.52 --> 460.639
but rather the modem itself there was

459.199 --> 462.8
something wrong with it it was in the

460.639 --> 464.879
night so it's not gonna reset the

462.8 --> 468.0
electricity or anything

464.879 --> 471.199
so i just went to bed early and i don't

468.0 --> 474.319
regret that because i had a

471.199 --> 479.84000000000003
very good night rest right

474.319 --> 479.84000000000003
hello yado

482.0 --> 485.28
i cut green tea with me

488.4 --> 493.35999999999996
[Music]

491.12 --> 507.84000000000003
right so what have you guys and gals

493.36 --> 507.84000000000003
been up to

519.519 --> 524.48
yeah i

522.64 --> 527.76
also been digging around a little with

524.48 --> 527.76
infowars but it's just

532.32 --> 538.32
these days i have to be careful just

535.68 --> 540.2399999999999
by my own principles not to just draw in

538.32 --> 542.1600000000001
everything that i bump into because so

540.24 --> 544.64
much of it

542.16 --> 546.48
is just squirt material it just makes

544.64 --> 550.08
you squirt just makes you like

546.48 --> 552.8000000000001
how dare you and

550.08 --> 554.9590000000001
it seems a little useless to me

552.8 --> 556.959
sometimes so i try to avoid that as much

554.959 --> 563.4399999999999
as possible

556.959 --> 566.0
most of it is is all nonsense anyway

563.44 --> 568.0
but right before i started up the show i

566.0 --> 577.839
did kind of rouse around a little and

568.0 --> 577.839
just came across this ridiculous thing

577.92 --> 587.68
oh wait no no no it's a prediction

582.8 --> 590.0799999999999
right okay like i misread it

587.68 --> 591.76
looking through it again it was actually

590.08 --> 595.6
a prediction

591.76 --> 600.64
which is not that hard to make like

595.6 --> 600.64
some guy on the news says that

600.72 --> 605.36
leftists or communist revolutions as you

604.16 --> 609.68
will will start to

605.36 --> 612.9590000000001
openly mock free speech as a fetish

609.68 --> 612.959
from the right wing

613.279 --> 616.32
it's just absolutely ridiculous but

615.2 --> 618.5600000000001
they'll do it anyway

616.32 --> 620.5600000000001
because they don't give [ __ ] communists

618.56 --> 624.0
will say whatever

620.56 --> 626.8
they can to demoralize

624.0 --> 626.8
confuse

627.36 --> 633.21
and just yeah progress their

630.72 --> 636.339
total mind control

633.21 --> 636.339
[Music]

640.88 --> 647.8389999999999
looking for work watching crypto how do

644.079 --> 647.8389999999999
you watch crypto

663.44 --> 669.6
look at the charts okay

666.48 --> 672.5600000000001
so is there anything you've been able to

669.6 --> 672.5600000000001
conclude from those

672.839 --> 675.839
charts

684.23 --> 687.989
[Music]

691.76 --> 703.8389999999999
wish i had more ethereum yeah

695.12 --> 703.839
yeah me too

706.16 --> 710.3199999999999
it's weird though i think i might have

708.0 --> 712.32
some ethereum token somewhere but i kind

710.32 --> 714.5600000000001
of neglected it

712.32 --> 716.24
didn't take it too serious didn't know

714.56 --> 718.7199999999999
really what to do with it

716.24 --> 719.839
if i had only taken a little bit more

718.72 --> 724.0
effort and actually

719.839 --> 727.36
just moved it all into my crypto wallet

724.0 --> 727.36
then i might actually have

728.32 --> 732.0
an amount of ethereum but yeah i never

730.88 --> 733.76
did that

732.0 --> 735.6
because i didn't understand it i didn't

733.76 --> 737.12
understand any of it it's like oh yes

735.6 --> 739.36
you got this and i

737.12 --> 740.24
i don't even know what that is how that

739.36 --> 743.839
works

740.24 --> 747.519
where it is how do you move it what do

743.839 --> 747.519
you do with it i didn't know any of that

748.32 --> 751.36
there are 100 of them

752.72 --> 758.72
okay oh there's

756.0 --> 759.839
more crypto situations that are going to

758.72 --> 763.9200000000001
go up like that

759.839 --> 763.9200000000001
you know so is gt plus

769.839 --> 773.7600000000001
like it is said that somewhere in the

772.56 --> 776.0
next few weeks that

773.76 --> 777.4399999999999
that one is going up two thousand

776.0 --> 780.48
percent

777.44 --> 782.24
like very persistently it's it's not

780.48 --> 784.5600000000001
like ooh

782.24 --> 786.32
it's just that like bang it's gonna go

784.56 --> 789.5189999999999
to a euro

786.32 --> 791.6800000000001
so we'll see if that happens i have no

789.519 --> 794.88
control over it

791.68 --> 794.88
but it would certainly be

794.959 --> 801.8389999999999
a great solution

798.88 --> 804.399
to my issues my financial issues

801.839 --> 804.399
especially

806.16 --> 815.8389999999999
twelve thousand pound really

826.839 --> 843.839
hmm

828.0 --> 843.839
me see if i can find something back

855.519 --> 859.24
uh

855.92 --> 859.24
[Music]

863.12 --> 871.839
where is it

882.24 --> 886.639
parrot i can't find it back

894.8 --> 899.8389999999999
hold on

924.839 --> 927.839
uh

945.12 --> 948.32
all right uh what

949.24 --> 955.839
1200 right yeah okay

968.48 --> 977.6
but don't stare too blind on it though

973.44 --> 977.6
it's still like trade dependent

979.199 --> 983.279
so i'd say like if you have excess

981.36 --> 985.519
amounts of money

983.279 --> 987.279
that you can invest then yeah theory

985.519 --> 989.199
would probably be a great investment at

987.279 --> 992.32
the moment

989.199 --> 994.0
if you can just leave it there if you're

992.32 --> 997.36
like oh i need quick money

994.0 --> 998.48
that doesn't really work because then

997.36 --> 1002.88
you're

998.48 --> 1006.32
gonna get it then you have to wait

1002.88 --> 1009.36
and then sell it and then people

1006.32 --> 1011.839
are going to try to rip you off again

1009.36 --> 1014.24
so that your profit will be as little as

1011.839 --> 1020.5600000000001
possible

1014.24 --> 1020.5600000000001
it happens it's not that easy trading

1022.839 --> 1025.839
crypto

1036.839 --> 1039.839
cool

1042.799 --> 1046.319
all right well if you guys say that it's

1044.72 --> 1053.84
all going to be double and the theorem

1046.319 --> 1053.84
is exploding cool

1064.84 --> 1070.0
so

1066.96 --> 1072.16
yeah let me check

1070.0 --> 1076.0
i don't think anybody has donated any

1072.16 --> 1076.0
kind of crypto to me just yet

1079.44 --> 1086.4
or if they did they didn't tell me

1083.2 --> 1089.44
nope i didn't think so

1086.4 --> 1089.44
but anyway yeah

1090.0 --> 1096.64
i am still gonna be part of this

1093.28 --> 1100.3999999999999
of the gt plus i keep mentioning it

1096.64 --> 1103.76
just gave you

1100.4 --> 1106.88
like a forewarning it's going to go up 2

1103.76 --> 1110.559
000 right you could just

1106.88 --> 1110.5590000000002
freaking ignore that if you like

1111.039 --> 1114.48
just do nothing with it you know even

1113.36 --> 1117.9189999999999
though

1114.48 --> 1117.919
it's not that hard to get it

1120.08 --> 1127.4399999999998
what is it how do we do it

1123.6 --> 1130.6399999999999
well you you can trade gt plus

1127.44 --> 1137.6000000000001
in the crypto circuit it's not

1130.64 --> 1139.44
super easy to do

1137.6 --> 1142.1599999999999
but i know it's out there i've been

1139.44 --> 1142.16
dealing with it

1143.6 --> 1147.6789999999999
and there yeah it's not just gt plus

1145.919 --> 1149.2
though that like there's two other types

1147.679 --> 1151.52
of crypto things also

1149.2 --> 1154.24
connected to it again it's a little

1151.52 --> 1154.24
complicated

1159.36 --> 1168.3999999999999
let's see

1165.36 --> 1168.799
but yeah just try to look for it it's

1168.4 --> 1172.0800000000002
called

1168.799 --> 1173.039
gt plus see if you can find it in trade

1172.08 --> 1179.84
system i know

1173.039 --> 1179.84
it's there on bit links

1184.35 --> 1187.52
[Music]

1188.559 --> 1196.0
yeah but it's not like gt

1192.08 --> 1198.799
plus is never or has never been

1196.0 --> 1201.76
meant as like a front runner type of

1198.799 --> 1201.76
cryptocurrency

1201.919 --> 1207.919
it's always been meant to kind of stay

1204.159 --> 1211.679
in the back and instead of like

1207.919 --> 1214.0
giving rushes of more money more growth

1211.679 --> 1215.919
quickly

1214.0 --> 1217.36
it's been specifically designed for

1215.919 --> 1221.8400000000001
stability

1217.36 --> 1221.84
on the long run and to be able to

1222.48 --> 1229.52
prevent manipulation from the outsiders

1226.64 --> 1230.5590000000002
from the banking cartel and that's why

1229.52 --> 1234.1589999999999
that this group

1230.559 --> 1237.44
that has worked on that has been

1234.159 --> 1238.4
attacked with just giant amounts of

1237.44 --> 1242.48
lawyers and

1238.4 --> 1249.8400000000001
all kinds of crap for a very long time

1242.48 --> 1249.84
i think for at least half a decade

1263.44 --> 1278.24
hello dutch sailor

1276.0 --> 1280.0
jay boy why the hell would you think i

1278.24 --> 1282.72
live in timbuktu

1280.0 --> 1284.159
i do it i don't even know where that is

1282.72 --> 1286.4
i live in the netherlands

1284.159 --> 1291.2800000000002
it's ridiculous why are you asking such

1286.4 --> 1293.52
questions think it's funny

1291.28 --> 1295.9189999999999
why why would you just like do you

1293.52 --> 1297.84
always move up to random people on the

1295.919 --> 1305.8400000000001
internet and ask you hey do you live in

1297.84 --> 1305.84
timbuktu what kind of a question is that

1308.62 --> 1311.7299999999998
[Music]

1316.32 --> 1319.84
yeah cameron gilmore

1323.919 --> 1331.2
okay yeah if you got something uh

1328.0 --> 1333.84
useful to say come back in five minutes

1331.2 --> 1333.8400000000001
yeah boy

1335.76 --> 1339.52
yeah i don't know really how look

1338.0 --> 1341.919
cameron cat mcas a gilmore

1339.52 --> 1344.08
cryptocurrency is very confusing to me

1341.919 --> 1347.2
too it is

1344.08 --> 1348.799
but it does work though so

1347.2 --> 1351.2
how it works is you have to have a

1348.799 --> 1351.84
digital wallet it's kind of like a bank

1351.2 --> 1355.3600000000001
account

1351.84 --> 1355.36
except it's separate

1355.52 --> 1362.4
connect it

1359.12 --> 1364.84
to a to a wallet

1362.4 --> 1366.0800000000002
where you can literally just have the

1364.84 --> 1368.799
cryptocurrencies

1366.08 --> 1370.3999999999999
different types in it you save it up in

1368.799 --> 1373.28
there

1370.4 --> 1374.4
and you can transfer it and yeah there

1373.28 --> 1377.52
are other people

1374.4 --> 1380.159
and companies that trade it

1377.52 --> 1381.44
so that you can literally use it as a

1380.159 --> 1384.5590000000002
cash wallet except

1381.44 --> 1385.76
cash it uses crypto and there's other

1384.559 --> 1389.9189999999999
people that are also

1385.76 --> 1393.039
willing to trade crypto instead of money

1389.919 --> 1395.679
for services or for

1393.039 --> 1396.799
well for items you're buying from them

1395.679 --> 1400.0800000000002
so

1396.799 --> 1401.12
that's it it's just another opportunity

1400.08 --> 1404.24
and it is

1401.12 --> 1408.2399999999998
like yeah the crypto is tradable

1404.24 --> 1408.24
into cash that is really the

1408.48 --> 1411.76
the most important part

1411.919 --> 1418.7990000000002
is that it is recognized as

1415.6 --> 1420.08
as a cash value as having that and then

1418.799 --> 1422.24
being part of the market

1420.08 --> 1424.559
that will determine that value and it's

1422.24 --> 1424.559
very

1424.88 --> 1429.279
dynamic and all depends on like the the

1427.84 --> 1431.9189999999999
original plan

1429.279 --> 1434.08
of how it is produced and all that like

1431.919 --> 1438.0
every cryptocurrency has its own

1434.08 --> 1438.0
plan it's like its own

1439.279 --> 1444.64
company plan investment plan

1442.559 --> 1446.08
thing that it's trying to achieve where

1444.64 --> 1449.039
it's gonna go

1446.08 --> 1451.52
what the objectives are within the

1449.039 --> 1455.12
crypto market etc etc

1451.52 --> 1457.44
yeah that's a whole world of information

1455.12 --> 1459.6789999999999
and you can specialize in it and you'll

1457.44 --> 1462.159
probably

1459.679 --> 1463.44
be able to make a living of just being

1462.159 --> 1465.44
an expert

1463.44 --> 1467.52
and advising people how to do these

1465.44 --> 1470.0800000000002
things because there is so much

1467.52 --> 1472.799
involved in it especially at first it's

1470.08 --> 1476.0
very confusing

1472.799 --> 1478.24
if you dare try it out you might be

1476.0 --> 1481.039
surprised how many

1478.24 --> 1483.1200000000001
opportunities are there because there's

1481.039 --> 1486.72
some really interesting projects

1483.12 --> 1489.279
among them and one of these projects is

1486.72 --> 1490.64
my own or well my own it's what i've

1489.279 --> 1494.48
been a part of for

1490.64 --> 1497.2
for five years gti

1494.48 --> 1499.1200000000001
global technology innovation yeah yeah

1497.2 --> 1501.6000000000001
it had to have a global of course

1499.12 --> 1502.4799999999998
it wasn't called global originally but

1501.6 --> 1505.279
it was just

1502.48 --> 1506.48
g they jewish the g it didn't really

1505.279 --> 1509.12
mean anything

1506.48 --> 1510.88
or actually the name was a joke but then

1509.12 --> 1514.0
they kind of decided what it was called

1510.88 --> 1516.48
and guess what it's global yay

1514.0 --> 1519.6
i'm part of a global corporation with

1516.48 --> 1522.96
global in its name isn't that just great

1519.6 --> 1522.9599999999998
yeah whatever

1525.2 --> 1530.64
okay here we go again see you later have

1528.0 --> 1530.64
fun with the

1540.84 --> 1546.48
exercise

1543.279 --> 1548.32
all right yes rufus sent hubbins

1546.48 --> 1549.679
pump and dumps well that's the thing you

1548.32 --> 1552.96
see you have

1549.679 --> 1556.0800000000002
front runner cryptocurrencies

1552.96 --> 1559.039
it it is in a way kind of similar to

1556.08 --> 1560.08
the stocks stock trading system but it's

1559.039 --> 1562.559
different

1560.08 --> 1564.72
it is different but it has similarities

1562.559 --> 1567.279
so you'll have cryptos that'll really be

1564.72 --> 1568.0
like i'm on the front i'm a quick buck

1567.279 --> 1571.12
i'm

1568.0 --> 1571.6
i'm ready for taking over to become some

1571.12 --> 1574.6399999999999
kind of

1571.6 --> 1577.84
the replace bitcoin or hope to

1574.64 --> 1578.24
one day or something and others are like

1577.84 --> 1581.36
no

1578.24 --> 1584.32
we're just about stability stable

1581.36 --> 1587.6789999999999
production and that is where the gti

1584.32 --> 1589.52
really focused on in its mission is to

1587.679 --> 1592.3200000000002
really think about the far

1589.52 --> 1594.0
far future when things are getting

1592.32 --> 1596.799
really complicated

1594.0 --> 1598.64
unravel much more easily and the market

1596.799 --> 1601.76
is much more chaotic

1598.64 --> 1605.039
they all basically

1601.76 --> 1608.64
took that into account so

1605.039 --> 1610.72
gti is specifically meant kind of like

1608.64 --> 1613.3600000000001
what i am personally doing

1610.72 --> 1613.919
digging in trying to get his deep roots

1613.36 --> 1616.559
and then

1613.919 --> 1617.8400000000001
surviving the storm that was really the

1616.559 --> 1622.08
objective

1617.84 --> 1624.08
of gti like for itself

1622.08 --> 1627.1999999999998
and like what it is doing what it is

1624.08 --> 1632.1589999999999
providing is financial

1627.2 --> 1632.159
security what it's doing is like a

1635.279 --> 1643.76
well corporate

1638.96 --> 1643.76
unconditional income

1645.12 --> 1651.1999999999998
right sounds extremely appealing right

1648.159 --> 1652.72
and yeah then you go just like the basic

1651.2 --> 1654.0800000000002
income well we already we can't even

1652.72 --> 1656.799
call it basic income there was

1654.08 --> 1658.08
huge issues if you would call it that

1656.799 --> 1659.9189999999999
lawyers would come after you

1658.08 --> 1662.48
they're not going to call it that right

1659.919 --> 1665.6000000000001
it isn't really a basic income

1662.48 --> 1666.799
because yeah when a government would do

1665.6 --> 1668.7199999999998
that

1666.799 --> 1670.559
there's all kinds of consequences and

1668.72 --> 1672.0
then they can potentially because their

1670.559 --> 1674.799
freaking government

1672.0 --> 1676.799
start to put rules on that [ __ ] well

1674.799 --> 1680.399
guess what

1676.799 --> 1682.48
gti in its own way does that

1680.399 --> 1683.52
but it does it internally and it does it

1682.48 --> 1687.3600000000001
purely

1683.52 --> 1688.48
to protect the market and with everybody

1687.36 --> 1692.4799999999998
in it

1688.48 --> 1694.159
like on our side so there is like

1692.48 --> 1695.919
weird little things going on it's kind

1694.159 --> 1698.159
of confusing it's been extremely

1695.919 --> 1699.6000000000001
confusing to me i can't keep track of

1698.159 --> 1700.88
how it works

1699.6 --> 1703.039
it's like yeah we're going to change

1700.88 --> 1704.96
this we're going to change that

1703.039 --> 1707.2
and i have no oversight over what that

1704.96 --> 1709.279
really means if you would think it would

1707.2 --> 1711.679
be some kind of nefarious thing then

1709.279 --> 1715.2
you'd probably

1711.679 --> 1717.8400000000001
be very frustrated but they are really

1715.2 --> 1720.64
doing their best and each time

1717.84 --> 1722.1589999999999
like when some process they've initiated

1720.64 --> 1725.3600000000001
has resolved

1722.159 --> 1727.2
the outcome is really good and i think

1725.36 --> 1728.6399999999999
that there is a lot of people that are

1727.2 --> 1731.3600000000001
part of gti

1728.64 --> 1732.0
that are really making a killing out of

1731.36 --> 1738.24
it

1732.0 --> 1740.88
like a real killing and

1738.24 --> 1743.84
yeah as you're not going to be a

1740.88 --> 1747.0390000000002
billionaire or something just from

1743.84 --> 1750.48
gti but they will have

1747.039 --> 1753.039
a pretty high income permanently

1750.48 --> 1753.76
the rest of their lives guaranteed it's

1753.039 --> 1756.799
like

1753.76 --> 1758.96
inheritable even your kids will

1756.799 --> 1761.12
inherit your gti account do you

1758.96 --> 1764.0
understand it's a lifelong

1761.12 --> 1765.84
and inheritable like it can never die

1764.0 --> 1768.0
there is no exploration there is no

1765.84 --> 1769.84
expiration date

1768.0 --> 1771.279
or at least on the account that i have

1769.84 --> 1774.24
because they did update

1771.279 --> 1775.12
the rules and newer accounts have a

1774.24 --> 1776.72
10-year

1775.12 --> 1778.4799999999998
lifetime on their account and then you

1776.72 --> 1780.799
have to kind of like do

1778.48 --> 1782.96
one-time investment and then lengthen it

1780.799 --> 1784.08
for another 10 years i don't even have

1782.96 --> 1787.1200000000001
to do that

1784.08 --> 1789.039
it's just lifetime

1787.12 --> 1792.0
so the only thing that's really

1789.039 --> 1795.679
important is that what comes out of it

1792.0 --> 1799.6
will stay recognized as trade ware

1795.679 --> 1801.1200000000001
and can be cashed in as long as that is

1799.6 --> 1804.799
possible then i have an

1801.12 --> 1809.52
income once yeah especially once it

1804.799 --> 1811.9189999999999
hits the the your the your one euro

1809.52 --> 1811.9189999999999
number

1817.84 --> 1821.9189999999999
yeah yeah harvest your mark of the beast

1820.159 --> 1824.3200000000002
cool yeah yeah well i'm going to have an

1821.919 --> 1824.3200000000002
income

1826.48 --> 1831.2
and hey if they're ever going to like

1828.399 --> 1833.1999999999998
screw over this country big time

1831.2 --> 1835.679
it's a bit nervous about that like what

1833.2 --> 1837.44
if they just at some point just decide

1835.679 --> 1839.2
this is enough we're going to change

1837.44 --> 1842.159
everything and

1839.2 --> 1843.919
like social welfare might just be like

1842.159 --> 1846.0800000000002
who knows if some right wing

1843.919 --> 1848.48
group and they are there they're out

1846.08 --> 1851.039
there if they're gonna take over try to

1848.48 --> 1853.76
cut down on a lot of the fraud which

1851.039 --> 1856.799
does happen with social welfare

1853.76 --> 1858.399
they might just like scrap it or change

1856.799 --> 1860.6399999999999
it so dramatically that

1858.399 --> 1861.5189999999998
with the setup that i have here

1860.64 --> 1864.88
surviving

1861.519 --> 1868.3990000000001
with it that's just impossible

1864.88 --> 1871.279
well if i have the crypto then i can

1868.399 --> 1873.1999999999998
go off it and survive and still continue

1871.279 --> 1876.559
doing this

1873.2 --> 1879.76
and even thrive and

1876.559 --> 1882.399
get the full the full

1879.76 --> 1883.12
amount from from the google income as

1882.399 --> 1885.6
well

1883.12 --> 1886.32
because it won't be detracted anymore

1885.6 --> 1889.36
right

1886.32 --> 1891.6
good situation and it's it might be here

1889.36 --> 1893.039
just in the next week or two weeks or

1891.6 --> 1895.6789999999999
something in the next month

1893.039 --> 1898.72
i don't know exactly when i'm not

1895.679 --> 1898.72
informed enough

1899.919 --> 1907.8400000000001
but i can't wait

1915.84 --> 1921.84
working through a bank entity i'm not

1918.72 --> 1925.1200000000001
working really through a bank entity

1921.84 --> 1929.12
if anything they're not

1925.12 --> 1930.9599999999998
gta is like a corporation

1929.12 --> 1933.4399999999998
it's not a bank they're not even allowed

1930.96 --> 1936.08
to call themselves that

1933.44 --> 1939.679
also they cannot literally conjure up

1936.08 --> 1939.6789999999999
money out of nowhere through debt

1940.24 --> 1946.96
what it does do is utilize

1943.519 --> 1950.3990000000001
very efficiently program bots

1946.96 --> 1953.039
to keep on working in the

1950.399 --> 1955.36
money market the world money market on

1953.039 --> 1958.799
the lower tier

1955.36 --> 1959.76
so they don't scoop up giants amounts of

1958.799 --> 1962.96
profits like

1959.76 --> 1966.72
bankers do with their investments

1962.96 --> 1969.76
on that same market no this company

1966.72 --> 1970.64
only scoops up the little trades the

1969.76 --> 1973.44
trades that

1970.64 --> 1975.3600000000001
mostly benefit little people people that

1973.44 --> 1976.0800000000002
have small investments that want to get

1975.36 --> 1978.8799999999999
small business

1976.08 --> 1981.12
going yeah it's all part of it right and

1978.88 --> 1982.3200000000002
that keeps on going as long as there is

1981.12 --> 1986.0
money

1982.32 --> 1988.1589999999999
exchange in the world there will be

1986.0 --> 1989.039
this thing will keep on growing and

1988.159 --> 1991.3990000000001
producing that

1989.039 --> 1992.72
so if anything we are like financial

1991.399 --> 1995.84
competition

1992.72 --> 1997.3600000000001
to banker investors competition except

1995.84 --> 2000.0
we're not really competing

1997.36 --> 2001.6
we're just using the same ground for

2000.0 --> 2004.64
survival instead of

2001.6 --> 2007.12
quick quick quick grabbler profits

2004.64 --> 2008.159
see that's a different these guys have

2007.12 --> 2011.6
thought about this

2008.159 --> 2014.72
so much it's mind-blowing

2011.6 --> 2016.8799999999999
they planned this [ __ ] for five years

2014.72 --> 2019.84
and they're still planning for the

2016.88 --> 2019.8400000000001
future

2022.32 --> 2024.6399999999999
all right

2025.44 --> 2032.88
so yeah by that standard also i am

2030.24 --> 2033.44
opening up like if you want to be a part

2032.88 --> 2036.72
of it

2033.44 --> 2040.3990000000001
you can right

2036.72 --> 2042.72
and i am literally banning my life on it

2040.399 --> 2045.12
i'm that satisfied with it and well for

2042.72 --> 2045.3600000000001
me also because i had a zero investment

2045.12 --> 2047.9189999999999
i

2045.36 --> 2049.44
literally did not pay a cent to get in

2047.919 --> 2052.879
there i did not transfer

2049.44 --> 2055.919
any euros to them in order

2052.879 --> 2057.7599999999998
to have what i have now

2055.919 --> 2060.3199999999997
unfortunately new people that will

2057.76 --> 2063.599
arrive will have to do that

2060.32 --> 2066.0
there is some things you now have to get

2063.599 --> 2068.56
that i also had to get but i could

2066.0 --> 2070.32
already get them from

2068.56 --> 2073.599
the little points that i had been

2070.32 --> 2077.2000000000003
gathering over the last five years

2073.599 --> 2077.679
if you want to get in quick and be part

2077.2 --> 2080.3199999999997
of that

2077.679 --> 2082.0
then you'll have to put in some money

2080.32 --> 2084.96
it's not even that much

2082.0 --> 2084.96
it's like nothing

2085.839 --> 2090.32
it's maybe 100 euros or something i

2088.96 --> 2091.44
don't even know there's a couple of

2090.32 --> 2094.32
steps you have to take

2091.44 --> 2095.52
we'll have to talk about it so it's not

2094.32 --> 2098.2400000000002
that easy

2095.52 --> 2099.28
right and you should take that as a good

2098.24 --> 2103.04
sign because

2099.28 --> 2106.5600000000004
you yeah date they don't like

2103.04 --> 2109.2799999999997
people that act like infiltrators

2106.56 --> 2110.72
that grabbler it all around and then try

2109.28 --> 2112.96
to destroy it

2110.72 --> 2117.1189999999997
because there have been people that try

2112.96 --> 2119.04
that right

2117.119 --> 2121.76
yeah i've talked about this with robin

2119.04 --> 2121.7599999999998
stanley too

2122.72 --> 2126.0789999999997
but yeah she doesn't have the room at

2124.56 --> 2129.7599999999998
the moment but i am

2126.079 --> 2133.28
open for it with people that i do trust

2129.76 --> 2133.28
so it's not going to be everybody

2140.24 --> 2145.839
hello adam is done stone

2147.28 --> 2154.48
we're talking to dutch okay

2150.56 --> 2154.48
i don't know oh wait you mean dutch

2156.839 --> 2159.839
sailor

2168.8 --> 2172.8
by being your own bank yeah well it can

2171.359 --> 2175.2799999999997
do that

2172.8 --> 2176.0
but at the same time banks also do that

2175.28 --> 2178.4
they still

2176.0 --> 2179.76
have a lot of possessions they realize

2178.4 --> 2182.8
that right

2179.76 --> 2186.48
so even though they might be kind of

2182.8 --> 2189.119
losing slight money printing

2186.48 --> 2191.52
powers they still have gathered all that

2189.119 --> 2191.52
wealth

2191.839 --> 2198.0
gathered ripped it off through

2195.92 --> 2200.16
what's it called again through usury and

2198.0 --> 2202.16
all that but they have it

2200.16 --> 2203.839
it's theirs officially it's not going to

2202.16 --> 2206.3199999999997
be taken away from them

2203.839 --> 2206.96
just because the scene is changing and

2206.32 --> 2209.44
they will

2206.96 --> 2211.28
use that to do their own crypto thing

2209.44 --> 2212.88
and to try to wreck the market for

2211.28 --> 2215.8390000000004
others which they always have that's

2212.88 --> 2218.6400000000003
what bankers do

2215.839 --> 2220.64
try take a new market corner it and then

2218.64 --> 2223.04
destroy it for others so it's just

2220.64 --> 2223.04
theirs

2224.48 --> 2232.4
right and that's what gti was made for

2228.24 --> 2235.04
to be indestructible to not be stoppable

2232.4 --> 2236.56
and they got huge amounts of lawsuits

2235.04 --> 2240.16
like

2236.56 --> 2241.2
what is it hundreds of millions of euros

2240.16 --> 2244.3999999999996
worth

2241.2 --> 2248.0789999999997
of lawyers after them

2244.4 --> 2251.28
for years and they failed like these

2248.079 --> 2251.8390000000004
the opponents like hired chills against

2251.28 --> 2254.5600000000004
us and

2251.839 --> 2256.88
infiltrators and tattletails of all

2254.56 --> 2257.359
sorts everywhere like they did this they

2256.88 --> 2260.4
spent

2257.359 --> 2261.68
hundreds of millions to try and take

2260.4 --> 2264.7200000000003
this company down

2261.68 --> 2266.56
hundreds of millions understand

2264.72 --> 2268.839
just to take it down a company that

2266.56 --> 2271.839
nobody's even heard of

2268.839 --> 2275.2
right and they failed

2271.839 --> 2275.2
they failed to take it down

2278.32 --> 2284.079
hello fellow stop stop it

2281.92 --> 2287.04
stop trying to distract distract me with

2284.079 --> 2287.04
stupid questions

2290.4 --> 2299.28
all right so if anybody is interested

2294.72 --> 2303.2
in being part of gti and you have

2299.28 --> 2306.079
some some reserves to spend

2303.2 --> 2306.7999999999997
like if you are completely broke i can't

2306.079 --> 2309.6800000000003
help you

2306.8 --> 2311.04
i really can't not now i might be able

2309.68 --> 2314.0
to in the future

2311.04 --> 2314.88
once that price booms up then i

2314.0 --> 2318.0
literally

2314.88 --> 2318.32
have financial room potentially because

2318.0 --> 2320.72
i

2318.32 --> 2322.0
also had need a lot of investing for

2320.72 --> 2323.68
myself for

2322.0 --> 2325.44
updating my freaking clothes for

2323.68 --> 2327.2
starters

2325.44 --> 2329.04
and who knows living situation but i

2327.2 --> 2332.3999999999996
will have more room

2329.04 --> 2335.359
and just be able to basically buy

2332.4 --> 2335.92
an account for somebody else if i really

2335.359 --> 2339.5989999999997
feel

2335.92 --> 2342.16
they needed it you'd still have to yeah

2339.599 --> 2342.6400000000003
put in identification and all that

2342.16 --> 2345.92
because

2342.64 --> 2348.56
identification is critical like you have

2345.92 --> 2350.7200000000003
to have a fully registered identity

2348.56 --> 2352.24
everything they need to know everything

2350.72 --> 2355.2799999999997
you don't want that

2352.24 --> 2356.72
well then you're not gonna get it it's

2355.28 --> 2359.76
not anonymous

2356.72 --> 2361.5989999999997
you can't be anonymous a part of it

2359.76 --> 2364.0
they will protect your data they are

2361.599 --> 2365.52
definitely not using it for metadata

2364.0 --> 2369.04
harvesting and all that

2365.52 --> 2371.359
but you cannot be part of it anonymously

2369.04 --> 2374.56
it's impossible they don't allow it

2371.359 --> 2378.56
for reasons that i mentioned

2374.56 --> 2378.56
infiltrators people that try to wreck

2380.839 --> 2384.56
them

2382.64 --> 2386.4
yes that's what i'm talking about rufus

2384.56 --> 2390.0
st hubbard's global technology

2386.4 --> 2390.0
innovation that's the company name

2392.8 --> 2397.8390000000004
you're not familiar with that yet yeah

2394.88 --> 2397.839
no [ __ ]

2405.839 --> 2409.92
yeah they're not catching headlines they

2407.76 --> 2412.0
should be they should be catching

2409.92 --> 2415.2000000000003
headlines since they've been

2412.0 --> 2418.56
like attacked through

2415.2 --> 2420.24
lawyers and all that [ __ ] for half a

2418.56 --> 2424.48
decade

2420.24 --> 2427.2799999999997
but yeah guess what the media

2424.48 --> 2428.48
the media corporation that that same

2427.28 --> 2430.4
group

2428.48 --> 2432.319
they don't like him very much so that's

2430.4 --> 2435.599
why you literally

2432.319 --> 2437.119
never hear a word about it ever

2435.599 --> 2441.04
whatever is going to happen with it

2437.119 --> 2444.319
you're never gonna hear a word of it

2441.04 --> 2446.96
unless you well you seek it from within

2444.319 --> 2448.079
because there is hundreds of thousands

2446.96 --> 2451.2
of people in there

2448.079 --> 2453.52
also actively figuring things out

2451.2 --> 2457.04
talking about cryptocurrency

2453.52 --> 2460.319
trading with it helping

2457.04 --> 2463.359
the core with ideas of updates

2460.319 --> 2464.839
and new options like there's like weird

2463.359 --> 2468.48
crypto investment

2464.839 --> 2469.2799999999997
things that literally give you more of

2468.48 --> 2472.64
the same thing

2469.28 --> 2475.92
it's it's a weird digital world

2472.64 --> 2478.7999999999997
in there but it works

2475.92 --> 2479.04
it works really well for me so far and i

2478.8 --> 2481.44
am

2479.04 --> 2483.04
anything but an expert but i'm just

2481.44 --> 2485.04
picking the fruits of it and they're

2483.04 --> 2487.119
good

2485.04 --> 2490.079
and it's probably gonna get even better

2487.119 --> 2493.6800000000003
especially when yeah the price

2490.079 --> 2498.0
of it the value of of the gt plus token

2493.68 --> 2498.0
goes up around 2 000

2498.88 --> 2504.8
right which it will i predict that

2502.56 --> 2506.319
it's not my prediction even but i will

2504.8 --> 2509.44
say that

2506.319 --> 2511.359
so you people can remember that i said

2509.44 --> 2514.96
that and maybe think

2511.359 --> 2518.16
oh wow maybe you should freaking

2514.96 --> 2520.4
listen to arwyn sometimes when i'm

2518.16 --> 2522.56
actually handing out an opportunity yeah

2520.4 --> 2525.76
yeah this is not my secret

2522.56 --> 2528.48
devil's advocate contract you

2525.76 --> 2530.7200000000003
into hell trick yeah this is me

2528.48 --> 2533.04
literally

2530.72 --> 2534.48
trying to share an opportunity that

2533.04 --> 2538.079
could

2534.48 --> 2541.76
help you be completely crypto wise

2538.079 --> 2541.76
financially self-sufficient

2543.599 --> 2546.319
how about that

2547.2 --> 2550.7999999999997
but yeah i don't know people in my chat

2550.0 --> 2553.599
just don't

2550.8 --> 2555.8390000000004
give a [ __ ] on average they don't or

2553.599 --> 2558.96
they just think oh this is just arwen

2555.839 --> 2561.2
right it's just blabbering

2558.96 --> 2565.839
i don't know what it is i don't know why

2561.2 --> 2565.839
people are not contacting me about this

2568.079 --> 2573.6800000000003
like i'm basically a messenger here

2571.28 --> 2574.5600000000004
in relation to gti i'm a messenger

2573.68 --> 2576.8799999999997
because i know

2574.56 --> 2579.04
very little i just know i'm picking the

2576.88 --> 2582.0
fruits of it and i barely even had to do

2579.04 --> 2582.0
anything from it

2590.839 --> 2593.839
right

2598.4 --> 2605.04
yeah and for those that think oh oh i am

2602.72 --> 2606.56
i'm just going to look it up and then

2605.04 --> 2609.839
i'm going to make an account

2606.56 --> 2613.92
and then buy into it no no

2609.839 --> 2617.44
you can't that's not how it works

2613.92 --> 2619.28
you have to be connected to somebody

2617.44 --> 2622.2400000000002
that's already in the inside

2619.28 --> 2623.079
like me and that's how it works you

2622.24 --> 2626.16
can't

2623.079 --> 2628.4
anonymously go there make an

2626.16 --> 2629.5989999999997
account and be a part of it that's not

2628.4 --> 2632.7200000000003
how it works

2629.599 --> 2634.6400000000003
no anonymity that's not how it works

2632.72 --> 2636.319
your information is not going to be

2634.64 --> 2637.359
publicly visible

2636.319 --> 2638.88
it's not like you're going to have to

2637.359 --> 2640.64
wear a sticker on your forward that

2638.88 --> 2643.839
you're a part of it

2640.64 --> 2646.4
but you're not going to be able to

2643.839 --> 2646.96
not identify yourself and then be a part

2646.4 --> 2648.96
of it

2646.96 --> 2650.4
that's impossible you're going to have

2648.96 --> 2655.28
to find somebody

2650.4 --> 2657.28
to connect to i am somebody like that

2655.28 --> 2659.0400000000004
oh it sounds a little pyramidy well

2657.28 --> 2662.079
that's fine

2659.04 --> 2662.72
then just go about do your own thing do

2662.079 --> 2665.6800000000003
nothing

2662.72 --> 2668.0789999999997
just go go to oh it's worth something

2665.68 --> 2671.1189999999997
quickly throw money at it oh

2668.079 --> 2672.88
yeah go and do that then huh

2671.119 --> 2675.2000000000003
go be part of the market until you're

2672.88 --> 2677.599
consumed why don't you just do that then

2675.2 --> 2679.04
you think it's a little pyramiding

2677.599 --> 2681.3590000000004
little pyramidi

2679.04 --> 2682.16
right well normally with the pyramid

2681.359 --> 2685.2799999999997
scheme

2682.16 --> 2687.68
you invest and then you have to invest

2685.28 --> 2689.119
more and more and you have to get other

2687.68 --> 2691.5989999999997
people or it crashes

2689.119 --> 2693.52
yeah that's a pyramid this is not a

2691.599 --> 2696.96
pyramid i literally had

2693.52 --> 2700.319
zero investment zero

2696.96 --> 2704.0
never forwarded a send towards

2700.319 --> 2707.44
it ever yeah

2704.0 --> 2707.44
it's not a pyramid scheme

2707.92 --> 2714.4
there is a whole system behind it of

2711.04 --> 2718.72
things that are in the field functioning

2714.4 --> 2722.0
doing work robot work ai work yeah

2718.72 --> 2725.52
that's in there and they do work and you

2722.0 --> 2727.839
reap the profits like digital slavery

2725.52 --> 2730.319
robot slavery yeah yeah yeah it's better

2727.839 --> 2733.359
than human slavery won't you think

2730.319 --> 2735.68
right and besides it's already out there

2733.359 --> 2736.64
anyway it's already being abused to no

2735.68 --> 2738.64
end

2736.64 --> 2740.0789999999997
by people that don't give a [ __ ] about

2738.64 --> 2743.359
anything

2740.079 --> 2744.8390000000004
so i might just as well use it as my own

2743.359 --> 2747.7599999999998
little

2744.839 --> 2750.48
stable digital

2747.76 --> 2750.48
plantation

2750.88 --> 2755.92
that just can't stand the test of time

2753.839 --> 2760.0
and that's not all about just

2755.92 --> 2762.88
ripping and grabbling everything away

2760.0 --> 2764.88
right and you can be part of it too if

2762.88 --> 2766.96
you want

2764.88 --> 2768.079
or maybe it's just gonna be too scary

2766.96 --> 2771.44
and you're gonna look at

2768.079 --> 2774.48
it you're gonna look at it some more

2771.44 --> 2775.2000000000003
and maybe now you got your gt plus that

2774.48 --> 2776.96
you know

2775.2 --> 2778.72
that it exists you're gonna stare at it

2776.96 --> 2779.76
and then oh look at that oh it's going

2778.72 --> 2782.8799999999997
up two thousand

2779.76 --> 2784.5600000000004
percent all of a sudden oh and then

2782.88 --> 2786.079
you're gonna be interested

2784.56 --> 2788.48
right then you're probably gonna get

2786.079 --> 2789.76
interested and then all the grapplers

2788.48 --> 2790.2400000000002
are going to come first i wouldn't i

2789.76 --> 2793.0400000000004
wouldn't

2790.24 --> 2793.9199999999996
i wouldn't like i smell a quick grabbler

2793.04 --> 2795.839
prophet

2793.92 --> 2798.079
yeah yeah yeah well go [ __ ] yourself

2795.839 --> 2800.72
that's not going to work anymore

2798.079 --> 2801.52
yeah because that is not what it is this

2800.72 --> 2804.9599999999996
is

2801.52 --> 2808.0
this gti is a stable

2804.96 --> 2817.839
thing it's not for grabblers

2808.0 --> 2817.839
it's for survival

2821.2 --> 2824.3999999999996
so yeah keep looking at it keep looking

2823.44 --> 2827.599
at it

2824.4 --> 2830.4
yeah potentially in a month

2827.599 --> 2832.319
or in a year i'll be a different person

2830.4 --> 2833.6800000000003
sitting in a different room potentially

2832.319 --> 2839.04
having my dentals

2833.68 --> 2839.04
updated having new fixed clothes

2839.599 --> 2842.96
all the food that i need

2843.599 --> 2846.8
who knows what i'm going to be doing

2846.0 --> 2849.2
yeah

2846.8 --> 2851.44
been looking forward to that for five

2849.2 --> 2855.1189999999997
years

2851.44 --> 2857.599
originally this thing was

2855.119 --> 2858.6400000000003
the plan to sit through because if i

2857.599 --> 2861.6800000000003
didn't have it

2858.64 --> 2863.5989999999997
i would just stay in this position until

2861.68 --> 2865.44
every society breaks down and i can no

2863.599 --> 2868.6400000000003
longer survive

2865.44 --> 2872.079
right but because i did go with this

2868.64 --> 2876.48
this company the gti kind of

2872.079 --> 2879.119
relentingly is i it was a lot of hassle

2876.48 --> 2879.68
it gave me a lot of headaches because i

2879.119 --> 2882.0
am not

2879.68 --> 2883.5989999999997
the best of financial guys i really am

2882.0 --> 2887.839
not but it worked

2883.599 --> 2887.839
it's working it's still working

2888.24 --> 2893.52
and it's going to stay out there and the

2891.119 --> 2897.76
things that i have attained i have a

2893.52 --> 2900.0
life time possession

2897.76 --> 2901.3590000000004
and it's not going to stop it's never

2900.0 --> 2903.359
going to stop

2901.359 --> 2905.2799999999997
like this money is going to still be

2903.359 --> 2907.92
made even when i'm dead

2905.28 --> 2907.92
you understand

2910.24 --> 2917.04
so yeah

2914.4 --> 2918.0
just stand back look at it from a

2917.04 --> 2919.7599999999998
distance see

2918.0 --> 2921.52
how everything i'm saying is actually

2919.76 --> 2924.8
happening even though i barely have an

2921.52 --> 2928.24
understanding of it i admit that

2924.8 --> 2930.4
but i've been told a lot i know what to

2928.24 --> 2933.1189999999997
trust

2930.4 --> 2934.88
i know how they the people think kind of

2933.119 --> 2935.52
that make these predictions how it work

2934.88 --> 2937.2000000000003
it is

2935.52 --> 2940.48
it is kind of like its own little

2937.2 --> 2944.24
kingdom in a way

2940.48 --> 2947.76
but it's a very benevolent kingdom

2944.24 --> 2950.8799999999997
and it's really there to protect

2947.76 --> 2957.8390000000004
everybody that wants to be a part of it

2950.88 --> 2957.839
and not just exploit

2960.319 --> 2963.68
it no it it there is no pump and dumb

2962.8 --> 2967.3590000000004
that's physically

2963.68 --> 2968.319
impossible because you know why the

2967.359 --> 2971.359
crypto is

2968.319 --> 2974.64
secondary it's not the primary thing

2971.359 --> 2978.24
it's not the crypto is the thing

2974.64 --> 2984.4
no the crypto is the the product

2978.24 --> 2998.72
of something that lasts forever

2984.4 --> 3001.04
you see

2998.72 --> 3001.04
all right

3004.4 --> 3008.319
and if you like to know you can already

3006.96 --> 3011.2
now right now

3008.319 --> 3012.16
trade it for bitcoin you can trade gt

3011.2 --> 3017.4399999999996
plus for bitcoin

3012.16 --> 3017.44
just so you know literally right now

3018.559 --> 3023.599
and hey the other way around too you

3019.92 --> 3027.2000000000003
want some gt plus well you can trade it

3023.599 --> 3027.76
if you got bitcoin hey i'll trade you

3027.2 --> 3031.68
some

3027.76 --> 3034.6400000000003
i got some gt plus you want some of that

3031.68 --> 3036.24
you wanna want to take uh throw a couple

3034.64 --> 3039.68
of coins in and see it uh

3036.24 --> 3042.64
rise 200 uh 2 000 sure

3039.68 --> 3045.2799999999997
i don't care because that [ __ ] that gt

3042.64 --> 3048.319
plus is coming out of my ass

3045.28 --> 3055.8390000000004
i got a lot of it constantly

3048.319 --> 3055.839
never stopping

3056.559 --> 3069.8390000000004
so yeah leave it up to you

3072.0 --> 3077.44
yeah it is a good thing no [ __ ] that's

3074.0 --> 3078.72
why i'm talking about it for an hour

3077.44 --> 3080.96
that's why i'm bringing it up as a

3078.72 --> 3083.4399999999996
subject also because i can

3080.96 --> 3084.2400000000002
i'm allowed to a year ago i wasn't

3083.44 --> 3087.28
allowed to

3084.24 --> 3090.3999999999996
if i done that then i'd i'd get

3087.28 --> 3091.52
potentially strikes and i'd get a giant

3090.4 --> 3094.8
complaint

3091.52 --> 3097.839
from gti but my i don't know what it

3094.8 --> 3097.8390000000004
would have happened

3099.68 --> 3105.2799999999997
right now i can i'm allowed to i asked

3102.559 --> 3105.28
specifically

3105.359 --> 3113.7599999999998
you can do it now i can advertise for it

3110.0 --> 3117.599
tell tell other people what it is

3113.76 --> 3120.7200000000003
and hey if i trust you

3117.599 --> 3124.559
i think you're a trustworthy good person

3120.72 --> 3128.5589999999997
then i'll let you join my network too

3124.559 --> 3130.6400000000003
if you have the balls to do it right

3128.559 --> 3132.079
or unless you're so afraid of your

3130.64 --> 3134.72
pyramid scheme

3132.079 --> 3137.599
right oh my god what if you know what if

3134.72 --> 3139.68
it turned out to be a pyramid scheme oh

3137.599 --> 3141.92
well maybe you gotta just take a

3139.68 --> 3144.72
freaking risk sometimes then

3141.92 --> 3146.4
right sometimes not saying like oh every

3144.72 --> 3147.359
pyramid scheme you bump into you're

3146.4 --> 3150.559
gonna try out

3147.359 --> 3155.04
but before the gti

3150.559 --> 3157.28
my dad and me also tried another company

3155.04 --> 3158.48
it was different and it was more

3157.28 --> 3161.44
grablery

3158.48 --> 3162.8
and it crashed it crashed i still got

3161.44 --> 3165.599
more money out of it than it

3162.8 --> 3166.0
that it cost though but yeah that kind

3165.599 --> 3168.96
of thing

3166.0 --> 3170.8
that thing was a pyramid scan type

3168.96 --> 3173.04
because it was getting

3170.8 --> 3175.04
it was all about giving more quick

3173.04 --> 3177.599
profit quick quick quick quick

3175.04 --> 3179.52
and yeah those things turn out to be

3177.599 --> 3181.599
pyramid schemes a lot of the time

3179.52 --> 3182.559
because like the headquarters of that

3181.599 --> 3185.6800000000003
company just

3182.559 --> 3188.6400000000003
moved moved again and then suddenly

3185.68 --> 3190.3999999999996
you couldn't contact the company anymore

3188.64 --> 3192.839
and then things broke down and then you

3190.4 --> 3194.2400000000002
couldn't even complain about it's just

3192.839 --> 3197.839
gone

3194.24 --> 3201.2
right well this is not going to be that

3197.839 --> 3204.16
absolutely guarantee it i

3201.2 --> 3205.9199999999996
guarantee it for whatever that means

3204.16 --> 3210.0
that an arwyn is guaranteeing it

3205.92 --> 3223.599
of course but this is not that

3210.0 --> 3227.2
this has been going for five years

3223.599 --> 3227.2000000000003
you think of a golf gti

3231.04 --> 3236.0
okay oh yeah

3234.16 --> 3238.96
sorry i'm sorry that it doesn't have

3236.0 --> 3239.52
this glorious glorious luciferian name

3238.96 --> 3241.359
that'll

3239.52 --> 3243.52
burn itself in your mind for all

3241.359 --> 3247.119
eternity i'm sorry

3243.52 --> 3250.48
yeah it was never really meant for that

3247.119 --> 3253.599
if if you even realize that gti

3250.48 --> 3254.0
the original meaning it didn't have a

3253.599 --> 3256.96
meaning

3254.0 --> 3259.52
it was just random letters that the

3256.96 --> 3261.92
owner the founder of it

3259.52 --> 3262.559
just thought it was funny because it was

3261.92 --> 3265.2000000000003
like this

3262.559 --> 3266.079
niche reference to something belgium

3265.2 --> 3269.839
because the guy is

3266.079 --> 3273.2000000000003
belgium to something in his past

3269.839 --> 3275.359
it didn't it literally meant absolutely

3273.2 --> 3278.319
nothing didn't stand for any it was just

3275.359 --> 3279.5989999999997
gti he thought it was funny right that's

3278.319 --> 3282.88
what it originally means

3279.599 --> 3284.6400000000003
absolutely nothing it's not about the

3282.88 --> 3287.6800000000003
name it's not about oh look at me look

3284.64 --> 3290.839
at me i'm the big one i'm going to

3287.68 --> 3292.3999999999996
be the big guy no it's not what it's

3290.839 --> 3294.72
about

3292.4 --> 3296.2400000000002
it's about survival through a giant

3294.72 --> 3306.1699999999996
storm

3296.24 --> 3309.2599999999998
that's what it's about

3306.17 --> 3309.26
[Music]

3318.839 --> 3321.839
hmm

3328.079 --> 3332.6400000000003
right but yeah seriously guys i don't

3331.359 --> 3334.72
know who's watching this

3332.64 --> 3336.24
i don't know who gives a [ __ ] maybe you

3334.72 --> 3339.1189999999997

3360.96 --> 3365.599
opportunity and you did

3362.4 --> 3368.559

you got

3425.52 --> 3431.359
i'm fine with that too just don't

3428.64 --> 3432.0
don't expect me to understand every

3431.359 --> 3437.52
intricate

3432.0 --> 3437.52
detail about it right i'm not an expert

3437.92 --> 3442.2400000000002
but i am well interested in learning

3440.88 --> 3444.6400000000003
gradually more

3442.24 --> 3446.8799999999997
because i have to i must i have no

3444.64 --> 3448.0
choice it's become my my financial

3446.88 --> 3450.559
foundation

it will become that so i have no choice

3450.559 --> 3454.48
but to

3451.28 --> 3457.76
learn about it even though i

3454.48 --> 3457.76
trust me i'm not that eager

3458.24 --> 3461.839
but i have to be

3469.28 --> 3474.7200000000003
you trust coinbase my portfolio is up is

3473.2 --> 3489.839
that a crypto

3474.72 --> 3489.839
i never heard of that

3500.839 --> 3503.839
dammit

3528.839 --> 3531.839
so

3535.119 --> 3541.119
okay well good to hear chris la jumbe

3538.64 --> 3542.4
glad that you're being active out there

3541.119 --> 3545.839
and

3542.4 --> 3546.96
getting around who knows what i'm going

3545.839 --> 3549.2799999999997
to be doing you know

3546.96 --> 3550.96
with the gt plus eventually i'll

3549.28 --> 3551.92
potentially have piles of that and then

3550.96 --> 3554.319
i could just

3551.92 --> 3556.2400000000002
cash it in constantly and try to live

3554.319 --> 3558.799
off that

3556.24 --> 3561.1189999999997
but i myself could also try all kinds of

3558.799 --> 3562.96
investment things it's just that i

3561.119 --> 3565.2000000000003
don't have a lot of expectations that

3562.96 --> 3568.4
i'm going to be very good at it

3565.2 --> 3570.5589999999997
because i don't know stick mata how

3568.4 --> 3573.6800000000003
freaking

3570.559 --> 3576.96
stick the stigma of freaking financial

3573.68 --> 3578.8799999999997
situations with me i always screw it up

3576.96 --> 3580.319
i'm just terrible with money because i

3578.88 --> 3584.2400000000002
hate it

3580.319 --> 3587.04
i hate it i hate what it does to people

3584.24 --> 3587.4399999999996
i just i've never been able to get good

3587.04 --> 3589.68
at it

3587.44 --> 3592.16
because every time it money really just

3589.68 --> 3594.319
pisses me off

3592.16 --> 3600.24
i don't have it it pisses me off and

3594.319 --> 3602.079
when i have a lot of it it pisses me off

3600.24 --> 3615.839
right and i'm just gonna have to learn

3602.079 --> 3615.8390000000004
to deal with it

3627.119 --> 3633.04
right but uh yeah

3630.64 --> 3634.64
if any of you were interested in

3633.04 --> 3639.599
branching out

3634.64 --> 3643.1189999999997
maybe getting some of that gti

3639.599 --> 3646.799
being part of it i'm open for that

3643.119 --> 3649.2000000000003
but you have to basically contact me

3646.799 --> 3650.16
personally and then go through the

3649.2 --> 3652.72
process

3650.16 --> 3655.2
of the registration which is not just

3652.72 --> 3659.359
easy it's not just something

3655.2 --> 3662.5589999999997
you do in an hour right

3659.359 --> 3662.5589999999997
there's several steps

3664.48 --> 3668.16
but hey if you're interested contact me

3667.04 --> 3670.48
on skype

3668.16 --> 3672.24
and we'll talk about it and we'll see if

3670.48 --> 3672.72
you really care or if you're just like

3672.24 --> 3677.04
oh

3672.72 --> 3685.839
i'm just gonna poke yeah

3677.04 --> 3685.839
oh yeah in that case don't bother

3686.48 --> 3695.2
where to get gti you don't

3690.16 --> 3695.2
you you come to me you have to connect

3695.28 --> 3699.28
unless you just want to trade with gt

3697.359 --> 3700.72
plus that's out there on the market you

3699.28 --> 3704.2400000000002
could just find it

3700.72 --> 3706.5589999999997
buy it and sell it if you like

3704.24 --> 3707.7599999999998
if you want to be part of gti itself you

3706.559 --> 3710.079
have to connect

3707.76 --> 3712.7200000000003
to the network that is there you can't

3710.079 --> 3716.4
just start out from out of nowhere

3712.72 --> 3721.5989999999997
so yeah i am a part of the gti network

3716.4 --> 3721.599
and i have plenty of slots available to

3724.839 --> 3727.839
fill

3728.0 --> 3741.839
hey steamy traveler good to see you

3752.839 --> 3758.88
so

3755.68 --> 3761.839
but hey if you insist

3758.88 --> 3762.88
on not being connected to a little old

3761.839 --> 3766.16
darwin

3762.88 --> 3767.039
right because it's too scary too scary

3766.16 --> 3769.44
to be

3767.039 --> 3770.3190000000004
somehow connected to arween other than

3769.44 --> 3772.64
anonymous

3770.319 --> 3773.839
interface on the internet right maybe

3772.64 --> 3776.0
it's too scary

3773.839 --> 3778.48
or maybe you'll get lucky and find

3776.0 --> 3779.2
somebody else out there that has a gti

3778.48 --> 3781.039
account

3779.2 --> 3783.68
then you can connect to them if you

3781.039 --> 3786.88
insist not being connected to me

3783.68 --> 3789.2
because it's too scary yeah

3786.88 --> 3790.48
but good luck i'm not gonna help you

3789.2 --> 3792.96
find them

3790.48 --> 3793.68
but they're out there there's gti in

3792.96 --> 3796.0
pretty much

3793.68 --> 3798.0789999999997
every country in the world by now

3796.0 --> 3800.16
literally there's gti in africa there's

3798.079 --> 3803.92
in south america there's an australia

3800.16 --> 3807.92
asia europe all over the place

3803.92 --> 3810.64
united states canada everywhere

3807.92 --> 3812.2400000000002
yeah including africa they even made

3810.64 --> 3815.92
special effort

3812.24 --> 3817.0389999999998
to start basically to hand over gti

3815.92 --> 3820.079
accounts to

3817.039 --> 3823.28
people in africa that had trouble

3820.079 --> 3825.92
finding investment from banks

3823.28 --> 3826.48
for their little business like a one-man

3825.92 --> 3829.28
business

3826.48 --> 3832.319
so they just started handing out gti

3829.28 --> 3832.3190000000004
accounts to some of them

3832.48 --> 3837.76
right guess what bankers are not they

3835.359 --> 3842.48
don't like that

3837.76 --> 3845.039
they didn't like that all right

3842.48 --> 3847.52
yeah but yeah i'm not gonna hand you a

3845.039 --> 3850.3190000000004
gti account

3847.52 --> 3851.28
you're gonna have to come to me and get

3850.319 --> 3852.96
it

3851.28 --> 3854.88
and if you don't like it well try to

3852.96 --> 3856.7200000000003
find somebody else out there that is a

3854.88 --> 3858.96
gti account i'm not gonna help you with

3856.72 --> 3858.9599999999996
that

3860.319 --> 3864.64
how long have i been in it five years

3865.799 --> 3868.799
2015

3877.839 --> 3882.88
yeah since the spring of 2015.

3886.64 --> 3890.8799999999997
and it has changed a lot because when i

3889.119 --> 3892.1600000000003
started it out it didn't even have any

3890.88 --> 3895.039
crypto

3892.16 --> 3896.799
that didn't exist it was just the money

3895.039 --> 3901.039
making bots

3896.799 --> 3903.52
on the on the in the cash market let's

3901.039 --> 3903.5200000000004
call it again

3906.24 --> 3911.7599999999998
the faluta market the cash yeah the

3909.44 --> 3914.16
money exchange market and that's it that

3911.76 --> 3916.3190000000004
was all it was back then

3914.16 --> 3919.0389999999998
and it worked great even back then you

3916.319 --> 3920.88
could yeah there was no crypto

3919.039 --> 3922.559
that it was transferring into it was

3920.88 --> 3925.52
just raw money

3922.559 --> 3925.52
just like that

3926.319 --> 3930.319
except yeah i couldn't really cash it in

3929.44 --> 3932.799
yet because

3930.319 --> 3935.119
my account wasn't filled up yet now it's

3932.799 --> 3939.839
it's been full for a year

3935.119 --> 3939.839
i got i'm maxed out like that

3941.599 --> 3944.799
does take some time though

3947.44 --> 3953.599
but yeah also thanks to that

3950.48 --> 3956.64
that raw power it used to have that's

3953.599 --> 3959.839
part of the reason why

3956.64 --> 3961.92
all these lawyers came after us

3959.839 --> 3964.24
because it was too easy too good too

3961.92 --> 3968.48
much of a threat to the entire

3964.24 --> 3970.64
banking guild worldwide that's why

3968.48 --> 3971.599
because it was a giant threat but now

3970.64 --> 3975.7599999999998
that it's different

3971.599 --> 3979.3590000000004
and it's actually coming out in crypto

3975.76 --> 3981.6800000000003
and there's all kinds of things built

3979.359 --> 3984.0
within it and around it now it's

3981.68 --> 3984.0
different

3988.319 --> 3992.88
but potentially like i guess they were

3991.76 --> 3994.88
probably attacked

3992.88 --> 3996.96
because they threatened the entire

3994.88 --> 3998.0
crypto revolution that was about to

3996.96 --> 3999.76
unfold

3998.0 --> 4002.16
i think that that is probably the main

3999.76 --> 4003.3590000000004
reason why they were so savagely

4002.16 --> 4005.52
attacked through lawyers and

4003.359 --> 4008.0789999999997
infiltrators and [ __ ]

4005.52 --> 4009.52
because they could have potentially it

4008.079 --> 4012.96
caused

4009.52 --> 4014.0
an entire bypass of the crypto

4012.96 --> 4018.64
revolution

4014.0 --> 4018.64
they could have they didn't work out

4018.96 --> 4022.2400000000002
they had the room to advertise on a

4021.2 --> 4024.319
giant scale

4022.24 --> 4026.24
then they probably would have then we

4024.319 --> 4028.24
probably would barely have a crypto

4026.24 --> 4030.24
revolution everybody

4028.24 --> 4032.0789999999997
half the world would just have gti

4030.24 --> 4034.4799999999996
accounts and it would be

4032.079 --> 4036.2400000000002
nothing the controllers can do about it

4034.48 --> 4037.28
except just start a world where i just

4036.24 --> 4040.0
start raw

4037.28 --> 4040.0
killing people

4041.359 --> 4049.839
but that's not happening

4051.839 --> 4055.68
and people are caught up in the crypto

4054.0 --> 4060.16
revolution

4055.68 --> 4062.5589999999997
so yeah just do that then

4060.16 --> 4063.52
don't become part of gti i am a part of

4062.559 --> 4064.799
gti

4063.52 --> 4067.119
it's still going to do what it's going

4064.799 --> 4067.119
to do

4068.96 --> 4075.039
even though it hasn't yeah extinguished

4071.76 --> 4075.039
the crypto revolution

4075.44 --> 4080.079
and rather become became a part of it

4081.44 --> 4091.599
it did it never really needed to do that

4084.64 --> 4095.44
understand it never needed to do that

4091.599 --> 4098.799
for itself to to be able to survive

4095.44 --> 4101.359
but now yeah they were

4098.799 --> 4103.04
kind of like forced goaded towards there

4101.359 --> 4105.839
and now they're not being

4103.04 --> 4105.839
harassed as much

4107.979 --> 4111.6
[Music]

4109.679 --> 4113.4400000000005
because what it originally was was a

4111.6 --> 4116.88
system that was just too good

4113.44 --> 4120.159
it was too good it was unacceptably good

4116.88 --> 4121.839
to the banker guild worldwide

4120.159 --> 4125.12
they couldn't accept it it was too

4121.839 --> 4125.12
efficient too free

4131.759 --> 4148.64
hey julio pepin good to see you

4146.719 --> 4150.799
yeah steamy traveler yeah i've been

4148.64 --> 4153.1990000000005
talking about gti pretty much the entire

4150.799 --> 4153.199
hangout

4155.52 --> 4162.319
of gti benefited me in these

4158.64 --> 4162.319
parts in the five years well

4162.64 --> 4166.64
i've been able to get quite a lot of

4164.4 --> 4169.12
money out of it really

4166.64 --> 4171.1990000000005
but yeah i'm not literally cashing it in

4169.12 --> 4171.839
on my bank i'm doing it through my dad

4171.199 --> 4175.5199999999995
because i'm

4171.839 --> 4179.679
well avoiding

4175.52 --> 4183.040000000001
yeah complaints from the government

4179.679 --> 4184.88
i have to take it as a gift

4183.04 --> 4186.4
i have to take the money as a gift i

4184.88 --> 4189.359
can't just cash it in

4186.4 --> 4191.3589999999995
as my own because then the yeah then

4189.359 --> 4195.04
i'll have to register it as income then

4191.359 --> 4198.4800000000005
i'll take it away the actual income

4195.04 --> 4201.28
right so until it becomes

4198.48 --> 4202.08
enough that i can literally that i no

4201.28 --> 4204.5599999999995
longer need

4202.08 --> 4207.84
social welfare that's the moment where

4204.56 --> 4207.84
i'm gonna take it as it is

4209.199 --> 4214.839999999999
so as i'm satisfied that that i'm not

4212.48 --> 4216.959999999999
gonna stay

4214.84 --> 4220.2390000000005
stuck

4216.96 --> 4224.4
right but yeah i i've had

4220.239 --> 4224.4
food because of gti

4225.44 --> 4229.44
it's like it worked basically worked

4227.28 --> 4231.92
like that i i just gave a whole bunch of

4229.44 --> 4234.08
gt plus to my dad

4231.92 --> 4236.159
and he gave he sent me money to my bank

4234.08 --> 4239.44
account

4236.159 --> 4239.44
it wasn't really that much

4240.56 --> 4244.8
but because of it yeah i could do

4243.679 --> 4247.679
groceries

4244.8 --> 4248.56
and i yeah i got some cannabis that i

4247.679 --> 4251.52
could pre

4248.56 --> 4252.0
pay because of that and all that so yeah

4251.52 --> 4255.4400000000005
it has

4252.0 --> 4257.199
absolutely benefited me putting the tax

4255.44 --> 4260.32
on my dad

4257.199 --> 4260.32
well yeah

4261.44 --> 4268.159
but technically my dad is is living off

4264.48 --> 4270.48
pension so and hey if he would have

4268.159 --> 4274.879999999999
financial issues because if it would

4270.48 --> 4274.879999999999
have cost him then i wouldn't do it

4280.0 --> 4283.28
i'm just doing a like an in-family

4282.64 --> 4286.320000000001
trading

4283.28 --> 4288.159
trick basically i think that's uh

4286.32 --> 4291.04
plenty of people do that really

4288.159 --> 4291.04
especially in the net

4294.159 --> 4297.679
but if it would literally cost him then

4296.239 --> 4300.48
i wouldn't do it

4297.679 --> 4301.92
then i wouldn't do it to him i don't

4300.48 --> 4303.919999999999
want to be a burden to him he's been

4301.92 --> 4304.719
great you know i'm so happy with my dad

4303.92 --> 4306.96
and

4304.719 --> 4310.4800000000005
anything i want to give to him i want

4306.96 --> 4310.4800000000005
his life to be even better

4311.199 --> 4315.839999999999
because it's just yeah i'm so happy

4315.92 --> 4322.719
with who he is and that he's still there

4319.76 --> 4323.92
compared to who he was like 20 years ago

4322.719 --> 4326.2390000000005
and more

4323.92 --> 4327.679
like i'm so happy with him i don't want

4326.239 --> 4328.239
to burden him and i want to keep him

4327.679 --> 4331.52
alive

4328.239 --> 4334.48
as long as possible until he's all

4331.52 --> 4335.4400000000005
white and fragile and i was yeah i don't

4334.48 --> 4339.36
give a [ __ ] like

4335.44 --> 4341.919999999999
he's if i don't get 120 then he at least

4339.36 --> 4343.12
has to become that i want it to like i'm

4341.92 --> 4346.2390000000005
not gonna let him die

4343.12 --> 4347.5199999999995
it's like no dad i'm not gonna allow you

4346.239 --> 4349.5199999999995
to think it's okay

4347.52 --> 4353.280000000001
to just girl and die no you're gonna

4349.52 --> 4353.280000000001
live because i need you

4353.92 --> 4358.96
and he is and he is plenty healthy he

4356.88 --> 4360.400000000001
doesn't have any vital health problems

4358.96 --> 4362.32
never really did so it's just

4360.4 --> 4364.48
little things you know little age

4362.32 --> 4367.92
problems

4364.48 --> 4367.919999999999
but nothing really serious

4368.48 --> 4375.12
so heart problems or anything like that

4372.08 --> 4378.5599999999995
so he could survive for very long

4375.12 --> 4378.5599999999995
and i'm gonna make sure he will

4379.12 --> 4384.0
if it if i can it'll be up to him though

4383.199 --> 4385.919999999999
because i can't

4384.0 --> 4387.12
force him to survive like if he just

4385.92 --> 4391.04
says like no

4387.12 --> 4392.64
son it's it's like stop it

4391.04 --> 4396.0
yeah then there's really nothing i can

4392.64 --> 4399.1990000000005
do and can only do it if he wants it

4396.0 --> 4401.199
i could sure as hell try to make the

4399.199 --> 4402.96
world

4401.199 --> 4404.719
maybe a little bit better so that it'll

4402.96 --> 4408.0
stay worth it for him and i think

4404.719 --> 4410.84
by the way that overall like i have

4408.0 --> 4413.76
like pessimism problems or

4410.84 --> 4417.28
demoralization problems or you could

4413.76 --> 4420.2390000000005
roughly say like some depression issues

4417.28 --> 4420.239
my dad doesn't

4420.719 --> 4425.199
my dad's been a lot more stable in that

4424.0 --> 4428.4
sense than i have

4425.199 --> 4431.5199999999995
even though he does have emotions

4428.4 --> 4433.599999999999
but yeah this sort of these issues that

4431.52 --> 4436.159000000001
i have i think i got them just mostly

4433.6 --> 4438.08
from my mother and not from my dad

4436.159 --> 4441.839999999999
so he should be able to survive for a

4438.08 --> 4441.84
very long time

4453.84 --> 4457.84
ah ah glad you're doing some research

4456.56 --> 4460.080000000001
there rufus

4457.84 --> 4462.2390000000005
yes that's right there's the gt plus and

4460.08 --> 4469.84
the gtfa

4462.239 --> 4469.839999999999
the gt fta

4472.96 --> 4486.08
it's like the fortunate coin

4483.84 --> 4487.28
and you could probably find those coins

4486.08 --> 4490.159
out there

4487.28 --> 4490.48
and maybe even trade it if you want to

4490.159 --> 4493.92
be

4490.48 --> 4498.08
part of gtf of gta

4493.92 --> 4500.56
gta gti is just don't be part of gta

4498.08 --> 4500.5599999999995
it's bad

4502.239 --> 4505.839999999999
yeah you're going to have to come to me

4505.04 --> 4511.84
and then i

4505.84 --> 4511.84
can hook you up onto my network

4512.4 --> 4515.599999999999
or you could try to find somebody else

4514.239 --> 4517.44
that is in gti

4515.6 --> 4519.4400000000005
and then become a part of network if you

4517.44 --> 4525.839999999999
don't want to be connected to little

4519.44 --> 4525.839999999999
hardware in here

4532.61 --> 4539.839999999999
[Music]

4536.84 --> 4539.84
so

4544.719 --> 4549.52
oh yeah by the way you can also

4547.84 --> 4553.360000000001
literally just

4549.52 --> 4557.360000000001
arrange these accounts for your own kids

4553.36 --> 4559.679
literally you have to manage it for them

4557.36 --> 4562.719
of course until they can themselves

4559.679 --> 4565.92
but you can just yeah

4562.719 --> 4567.679
make your kid a part of it too in your

4565.92 --> 4569.679
own network like you get into it

4567.679 --> 4572.08
and then if you have a kid you literally

4569.679 --> 4575.4400000000005
get in them an account

4572.08 --> 4578.96
get them registered in and then

4575.44 --> 4583.199
put them on your network and then they

4578.96 --> 4583.199
will grow up having that as well

4587.12 --> 4593.28
yeah there's a lot of great

4590.159 --> 4594.08
possibilities with gti a great great

4593.28 --> 4597.28
possibility

4594.08 --> 4597.28
so yeah it's up to you

4597.52 --> 4601.92
contact me on skype if you're interested

4604.08 --> 4609.84
well i'll be back in two minutes

4694.8 --> 4698.08
ah hey what's that

4700.8 --> 4707.84
all right

4732.4 --> 4735.839999999999
huh cool

4740.48 --> 4744.48
yeah that's a good link there steamy

4743.199 --> 4749.839999999999
traveler thanks

4744.48 --> 4749.839999999999
for finding that

4756.94 --> 4760.0
[Music]

4760.84 --> 4763.84
so

4767.92 --> 4772.56
so yeah glad that i've been able to put

4770.8 --> 4775.12
all that down

4772.56 --> 4776.0
do a bit of a longer piece on gti

4775.12 --> 4779.28
there's a lot to be

4776.0 --> 4782.08
said i think that i'm pretty much

4779.28 --> 4784.4
kind of clumsy when it comes to

4782.08 --> 4786.4
explaining this

4784.4 --> 4787.839999999999
would be good to have somebody that's

4786.4 --> 4790.879999999999
more proficient

4787.84 --> 4793.360000000001
along with me to explain about it

4790.88 --> 4793.36
sometime

4795.52 --> 4799.52
but hey if you look around you'll

4797.12 --> 4803.12
probably by now find

4799.52 --> 4806.2390000000005
just fully dedicated presentations

4803.12 --> 4809.199
from gti members and

4806.239 --> 4811.36
and all that that are much more

4809.199 --> 4815.199
technically

4811.36 --> 4816.799999999999
detailed i'm just gay

4815.199 --> 4819.28
basically just gave you the rough

4816.8 --> 4821.12
outlines of it all

4819.28 --> 4822.88
because there's a lot of history to

4821.12 --> 4825.84
everything that's transpired and how

4822.88 --> 4827.84
gti has changed everything from the

4825.84 --> 4833.84
inside

4827.84 --> 4833.84
up until this point

4858.84 --> 4861.84
hmm

4900.08 --> 4907.28
right so yeah maybe move on

4903.92 --> 4907.28
this last half hour

4907.84 --> 4916.719
oh yeah by the way i didn't do the

4909.36 --> 4920.08
newspapers yesterday

4916.719 --> 4920.08
just not doing it

4921.76 --> 4928.159000000001
i'm not gonna put in people's mailboxes

4926.0 --> 4930.0
a suggestion that they should go and

4928.159 --> 4932.239
take the freaking corona vaccine

4930.0 --> 4935.199
which isn't actually a vaccine i will

4932.239 --> 4935.199
not be part of that

4937.34 --> 4940.43
[Music]

4940.96 --> 4944.4800000000005
what how much money do you think

4942.56 --> 4946.400000000001
somebody needs to retire comfortably i

4944.48 --> 4949.678999999999
don't know it all depends on where you

4946.4 --> 4949.679
are and what money is worth

4950.719 --> 4953.92
and what is available i don't know i

4952.8 --> 4959.84
have no idea

4953.92 --> 4959.84
steamy traveler no idea

4962.88 --> 4969.12
but when it comes to yeah retiring

4966.32 --> 4970.799999999999
what you're saying like i'm never gonna

4969.12 --> 4975.599999999999
get a pension

4970.8 --> 4975.6
guess what because i never really had

4975.92 --> 4980.56
a pension build up because i never

4977.92 --> 4982.4800000000005
really got a working career out there

4980.56 --> 4984.320000000001
because it was squirt boy or whatever

4982.48 --> 4987.36
the [ __ ] you want to call me before that

4984.32 --> 4990.159
right but yeah gti

4987.36 --> 4991.36
is going to effectively function as a

4990.159 --> 4995.839999999999
pension because it's

4991.36 --> 4999.36
life time lifetime

4995.84 --> 5000.08
so how much do you need comfortably well

4999.36 --> 5003.199
how about

5000.08 --> 5005.36
any how about some you know

5003.199 --> 5007.28
look at freaking pension funds out there

5005.36 --> 5008.08
you think that that's a safe bet to go

5007.28 --> 5009.84
with

5008.08 --> 5011.28
think that oh yeah that's perfect to

5009.84 --> 5014.56
rely on that

5011.28 --> 5018.48
and until you're so old that when they

5014.56 --> 5020.4800000000005
rob it from you you will be too old

5018.48 --> 5023.36
and outdated in your understanding of

5020.48 --> 5025.919999999999
how things work to do anything about it

5023.36 --> 5026.719
yeah well then i'm not gonna have that

5025.92 --> 5030.2390000000005
problem

5026.719 --> 5032.639
with the gti account i have

5030.239 --> 5032.638999999999
you see

5034.08 --> 5038.08
because nobody is just going to take

5040.84 --> 5045.289
that

5041.97 --> 5045.289000000001
[Music]

5051.42 --> 5054.459
[Music]

5054.84 --> 5057.84
uh

5062.239 --> 5066.638999999999
so yeah i don't know how much money

5064.4 --> 5067.04
somebody needs to comfortably retire i

5066.639 --> 5069.92
have

5067.04 --> 5071.28
absolutely no idea a steamy traveler no

5069.92 --> 5073.52
idea

5071.28 --> 5075.12
i'm not an expert in that sort of a

5073.52 --> 5085.84
thing by a long shot

5075.12 --> 5085.84
i don't know

5107.76 --> 5113.84
all right

5124.84 --> 5127.84
hmm

5137.04 --> 5140.639
all right you just need to be good at

5138.639 --> 5142.8
trading you don't need a pension except

5140.639 --> 5146.2390000000005
you have to keep on doing it

5142.8 --> 5148.56
right dr gonzo so what if you're too old

5146.239 --> 5150.799999999999
and decrepit to do anything

5148.56 --> 5152.2390000000005
like you can't fix you can't concentrate

5150.8 --> 5156.08
anymore on the trading

5152.239 --> 5159.36
how about that right well with gti

5156.08 --> 5161.5199999999995
you literally can be a drooling zombie

5159.36 --> 5164.48
nothing can stop you from getting that

5161.52 --> 5164.4800000000005
income you get it

5165.36 --> 5170.719
you don't need any actual skill

5170.96 --> 5179.6
at the end to do yet to to have it

5176.48 --> 5182.638999999999
you don't need to update your smarts

5179.6 --> 5184.96
to be able to compete to get it

5182.639 --> 5186.32
you understand you're not going to be

5184.96 --> 5189.36
forced to compete

5186.32 --> 5192.719
physically with a bunch of automated

5189.36 --> 5193.199
super robots that are just going to

5192.719 --> 5195.36
snatch

5193.199 --> 5197.199
everything away from your in front of

5195.36 --> 5198.4
your notes without you being able to do

5197.199 --> 5200.32
anything about it

5198.4 --> 5202.239
it doesn't have that problem it's not

5200.32 --> 5205.04
going to have that problem

5202.239 --> 5207.5199999999995
you see that's the difference yeah you

5205.04 --> 5210.48
don't need skills

5207.52 --> 5213.040000000001
to survive on the gti account you might

5210.48 --> 5216.48
need skills to get into it

5213.04 --> 5218.08
right if you don't even understand

5216.48 --> 5219.5199999999995
reading and writing or basic

5218.08 --> 5222.0
calculations you're going to have a bit

5219.52 --> 5227.360000000001
of a problem

5222.0 --> 5227.36
but there is no like oh you have to

5227.6 --> 5234.719
become a traitor or something

5231.52 --> 5236.320000000001
to get it you don't need to do that to

5234.719 --> 5239.84
survive

5236.32 --> 5239.84
you understand that's the difference

5240.0 --> 5244.96
and it's not luck either it's not

5250.84 --> 5253.84
luck

5260.88 --> 5264.96
hey and if you just want to get it and

5263.04 --> 5266.96
don't develop skills fine then don't

5264.96 --> 5268.56
develop skills don't participate in the

5266.96 --> 5270.8
freaking world

5268.56 --> 5272.639
just be a useless eater then if that is

5270.8 --> 5275.360000000001
what you want to do with your life

5272.639 --> 5276.4800000000005
then you can do that with your life you

5275.36 --> 5278.639
can just

5276.48 --> 5279.759999999999
waste everybody's time including your

5278.639 --> 5282.08
own and just do

5279.76 --> 5283.1990000000005
nothing if that's what you want to do

5282.08 --> 5285.84
with your life

5283.199 --> 5287.04
if you want to have i don't know other

5285.84 --> 5290.08
plans

5287.04 --> 5292.719
and actually do something with your time

5290.08 --> 5294.88
then you can because you don't have to

5292.719 --> 5297.12
worry about finances as much and you can

5294.88 --> 5299.76
just focus on what you really want to do

5297.12 --> 5300.96
now if you want to waste all your time i

5299.76 --> 5302.88
know partying and

5300.96 --> 5305.04
doing drugs and [ __ ] and all that yeah

5302.88 --> 5307.36
you can do that too

5305.04 --> 5309.6
right even that you can do that you can

5307.36 --> 5310.719
totally waste everybody's time and lay

5309.6 --> 5313.04
it all to shame

5310.719 --> 5314.639
with your own stupidity and lameness if

5313.04 --> 5316.96
you want to

5314.639 --> 5318.88
if you want to actually do some creative

5316.96 --> 5319.52
projects that you just couldn't find the

5318.88 --> 5321.679
time

5319.52 --> 5322.88
for because of financial issues all the

5321.679 --> 5325.76
time

5322.88 --> 5337.84
you can also do that so it's up to you

5325.76 --> 5337.84
what you do with it

5340.159 --> 5343.679
cool well dr gunn so if that's what you

5342.48 --> 5346.48
want to do

5343.679 --> 5351.84
sit in front of nine screens the rest of

5346.48 --> 5351.839999999999
your life

5352.0 --> 5365.84
sure you can do that

5365.85 --> 5368.959000000001
[Music]

5409.6 --> 5415.1990000000005
right roof sent up and said that's a

5411.36 --> 5415.199
good one i i used to do that too

5416.639 --> 5424.400000000001
i kind of still do it

5421.76 --> 5426.719
well in a sense that i have been like

5424.4 --> 5428.08
actively depriving myself of certain

5426.719 --> 5430.159
things

5428.08 --> 5432.32
it's like yeah that would be cool i'm

5430.159 --> 5434.799999999999
not gonna do it i don't have any money

5432.32 --> 5436.32
and if i get myself used to that sort of

5434.8 --> 5439.1990000000005
thing again

5436.32 --> 5440.159
i'll just be really miserable when i

5439.199 --> 5443.36
eventually am

5440.159 --> 5446.799999999999
unable to do it anymore

5443.36 --> 5447.5199999999995
so it's kind of the same thing as like a

5446.8 --> 5450.320000000001
reward

5447.52 --> 5451.360000000001
system except i've kind of turned it the

5450.32 --> 5455.12
other way around and

5451.36 --> 5455.12
rather deprive system

5455.36 --> 5461.36
it's like okay you're not gonna

5458.96 --> 5463.36
expand and all that you're gonna like

5461.36 --> 5464.96
wait it out a bit then you don't get the

5463.36 --> 5466.96
rewards

5464.96 --> 5469.36
that's in a way kind of like what i've

5466.96 --> 5472.639
done it sounds weird

5469.36 --> 5473.12
but it's worked in its own right i'm

5472.639 --> 5476.159000000001
still

5473.12 --> 5478.08
eating healthy enough

5476.159 --> 5481.199
healthy i'm eating really healthy really

5478.08 --> 5481.199
compared to most people

5488.32 --> 5493.679
nathan yamaha i agree gardening is

5492.08 --> 5496.32
awesome but i don't really have a garden

5493.679 --> 5499.52
right now i want one though

5496.32 --> 5502.4
like if as soon as i get out of this

5499.52 --> 5502.400000000001
cubicle here

5502.719 --> 5506.4
i will get some kind of garden it's like

5505.84 --> 5510.159000000001
it

5506.4 --> 5512.32
it if there's no garden i will not take

5510.159 --> 5512.32
it

5512.48 --> 5519.839999999999
doesn't even have to be big as long as

5514.32 --> 5533.84
it's just big enough

5519.84 --> 5533.84
but i'd love to do that [ __ ]

5538.719 --> 5542.0
what cryptocurrency is strengthened by

5541.36 --> 5545.679
space

5542.0 --> 5549.36
exploration what space exploration there

5545.679 --> 5552.4800000000005
is no space exploration

5549.36 --> 5556.4
maybe there's science fiction

5552.48 --> 5558.5599999999995
fantasy exploration

5556.4 --> 5560.5599999999995
i'm sure cryptocurrencies will

5558.56 --> 5562.4800000000005
strengthen that too

5560.56 --> 5564.4800000000005
if people want to follow their dream so

5562.48 --> 5567.839999999999
if they want to throw

5564.48 --> 5571.28
billions of dollars against some space

5567.84 --> 5572.2390000000005
thingy they'll do that but yeah but

5571.28 --> 5574.48
they'll just throw

5572.239 --> 5576.159
cryptocurrencies added just as well

5574.48 --> 5578.718999999999
because they're

5576.159 --> 5580.719
just as stupid just as fooled doesn't

5578.719 --> 5582.96
matter how much money they have

5580.719 --> 5584.56
what what form the money takes they'll

5582.96 --> 5589.84
still throw it at it

5584.56 --> 5589.84
because they're stupid

5603.679 --> 5611.12
what is a nova dr gonzo you mean a giant

5607.84 --> 5612.400000000001
burning gas ball exploding is that a

5611.12 --> 5614.719
supernova

5612.4 --> 5618.08
because i don't think there is giant gas

5614.719 --> 5621.28
balls anywhere in vacuums

5618.08 --> 5622.639
right the sun is not a giant burning

5621.28 --> 5625.04
ball of gas

5622.639 --> 5626.56
in a vacuum that's impossible it

5625.04 --> 5629.04
contradicts

5626.56 --> 5630.080000000001
laws of thermodynamics they are called

5629.04 --> 5632.639
stars

5630.08 --> 5634.719
yeah well stars are just lights it's

5632.639 --> 5636.96
just light in the sky with a specific

5634.719 --> 5639.76
angular relation

5636.96 --> 5641.12
to the observer on the earth the

5639.76 --> 5643.280000000001
position

5641.12 --> 5645.199
the angular position of these lights

5643.28 --> 5648.4
that you call stars

5645.199 --> 5650.638999999999
alter with time in a very specific

5648.4 --> 5651.92
pattern again relating to the position

5650.639 --> 5654.4800000000005
on the earth that's it

5651.92 --> 5655.28
yeah you can detect them visually you

5654.48 --> 5657.28
can look at it

5655.28 --> 5659.04
and see light coming from that direction

5657.28 --> 5661.92
i know you can definitely

5659.04 --> 5664.0
visually detect them that doesn't mean

5661.92 --> 5668.32
they're burning balls or gas

5664.0 --> 5671.6
at astronom astronomical distances away

5668.32 --> 5675.599999999999
larger than the earth right that's

5671.6 --> 5679.120000000001
all [ __ ] it's all non-proven

5675.6 --> 5682.08
what speed of light

5679.12 --> 5684.08
you can visually detect it based on the

5682.08 --> 5688.239
speed of light that does not make

5684.08 --> 5688.239
a lick of sense dr gonzo

5694.08 --> 5698.32
you can measure it or really what are

5695.679 --> 5702.719
you going to use to measure it a ruler

5698.32 --> 5706.08
measuring stick or you meant calculated

5702.719 --> 5708.159
based on presuppositional vantage points

5706.08 --> 5709.44
right yeah of course you can put in some

5708.159 --> 5712.08
numbers and then

5709.44 --> 5712.5599999999995
assume things are in a certain way and

5712.08 --> 5715.84
then

5712.56 --> 5717.119000000001
assume oh look when i pressed in these

5715.84 --> 5720.159000000001
numbers

5717.119 --> 5722.239
it says it's this far away

5720.159 --> 5723.92
because i calculated it and now i'm

5722.239 --> 5725.919999999999
going to

5723.92 --> 5727.6
mix that word calculation up with

5725.92 --> 5729.28
measure because that's very popular

5727.6 --> 5732.719
thing to do these days right

5729.28 --> 5735.759999999999
yeah it's not measuring it's calculated

5732.719 --> 5736.4800000000005
based on a presuppositional vantage

5735.76 --> 5739.52
point

5736.48 --> 5740.159
mainly that they are giant balls a gas

5739.52 --> 5743.84
burning

5740.159 --> 5743.839999999999
astronomical distances away

5744.159 --> 5748.5599999999995
yeah they're not they're light

5746.719 --> 5751.76
phenomenon

5748.56 --> 5751.76
they're light phenomena

5751.84 --> 5756.32
they're not balls of gas they don't even

5754.8 --> 5759.84
have a location

5756.32 --> 5760.799999999999
when you go towards it in a geometrical

5759.84 --> 5764.08
straight line

5760.8 --> 5766.4800000000005
from the visual vantage point on you'll

5764.08 --> 5769.84
never reach it you won't even approach

5766.48 --> 5773.5199999999995
it it'll start bending away

5769.84 --> 5777.04
because it is not a euclidean

5773.52 --> 5778.8
point in space anywhere

5777.04 --> 5781.76
where there is like a burning ball of

5778.8 --> 5783.76
gas giving off that light for you to see

5781.76 --> 5787.04
at that distance that's not what that is

5783.76 --> 5789.360000000001
it's light manifest it's like a hologram

5787.04 --> 5791.44
as a side effect of seeing the light

5789.36 --> 5794.48
coming from that direction

5791.44 --> 5797.919999999999
from literally nowhere manifest like

5794.48 --> 5799.04
manifest it it just comes it's not hey

5797.92 --> 5801.4400000000005
this thing

5799.04 --> 5802.48
light comes off it it comes to here no

5801.44 --> 5805.759999999999
it's just

5802.48 --> 5808.0
it appears it's just a light it appears

5805.76 --> 5808.88
it's celestial light it literally

5808.0 --> 5811.52
manifests

5808.88 --> 5812.2390000000005
out of nothing out of nowhere now the

5811.52 --> 5815.040000000001
energy

5812.239 --> 5816.4
is definitely coming from somewhere but

5815.04 --> 5820.0
it's not coming from an

5816.4 --> 5822.799999999999
object an electrified or chemically

5820.0 --> 5824.0
reacting object as we generate light

5822.8 --> 5826.639
here on earth

5824.0 --> 5827.36
right that's not what it is no it's

5826.639 --> 5830.56
light

5827.36 --> 5833.759999999999
manifest out of nothing just energy

5830.56 --> 5834.639
drawn in some kind of way in that

5833.76 --> 5838.0
pattern

5834.639 --> 5840.4800000000005
manifesting at la as light that comes to

5838.0 --> 5843.04
your direction

5840.48 --> 5843.919999999999
it doesn't come from a point it doesn't

5843.04 --> 5847.119
come from a

5843.92 --> 5850.2390000000005
thing it just manifests and then

5847.119 --> 5854.0
reaches your eye and you see

5850.239 --> 5857.04
that little dot as a side effect

5854.0 --> 5857.52
like a holographic signature of when you

5857.04 --> 5859.44
look

5857.52 --> 5861.280000000001
into the direction from which that light

5859.44 --> 5862.799999999999
is coming and you see that and the same

5861.28 --> 5865.599999999999
goes for the moon

5862.8 --> 5866.96
the sun all the planets all of it all

5865.6 --> 5869.96
the celestial lights

5866.96 --> 5871.36
are all non-local non-euclidean

5869.96 --> 5874.56
non-object

5871.36 --> 5876.799999999999
light manifest out of nothing

5874.56 --> 5877.76
yeah it sounds so ridiculous doesn't it

5876.8 --> 5880.88
it's [ __ ]

5877.76 --> 5882.159000000001
real though [ __ ] it's real you're gonna

5880.88 --> 5884.719
have to deal with it

5882.159 --> 5886.5599999999995
that your stupid presuppositional

5884.719 --> 5888.8
cosmology thinking is

5886.56 --> 5890.320000000001
absolute science fiction and based on

5888.8 --> 5892.96
absolutely nothing

5890.32 --> 5894.159
but a bunch of fantasies telling you

5892.96 --> 5896.88
what it's supposed to be

5894.159 --> 5898.92
without confirmation just a bunch of

5896.88 --> 5901.679
assumptions and reifying

5898.92 --> 5902.719
calculating with presuppositional

5901.679 --> 5905.36
vantage point

5902.719 --> 5906.0
is measuring it's not measuring

5905.36 --> 5908.48
measuring

5906.0 --> 5909.28
actually requires you to do something

5908.48 --> 5912.239
physical

5909.28 --> 5913.5199999999995
in the physical world to measure it

5912.239 --> 5915.678999999999
that's not what you're doing

5913.52 --> 5918.0
you're just calculating things on a

5915.679 --> 5920.08
presuppositional vantage point

5918.0 --> 5922.08
that's not measuring it's calculating

5920.08 --> 5924.719
based on assumptions

5922.08 --> 5927.6
about things that aren't really there

5924.719 --> 5927.6
that's what that is

5933.119 --> 5937.5199999999995
yeah just randomly start shouting words

5936.159 --> 5938.96
and think that that is some kind of

5937.52 --> 5941.6
proof

5938.96 --> 5942.32
just shout words that'll make it real

5941.6 --> 5945.04
right

5942.32 --> 5946.799999999999
that'll make it into a measurement and

5945.04 --> 5948.48
not just a calculation based on a

5946.8 --> 5951.360000000001
presuppositional vantage point

5948.48 --> 5953.04
draw on some other factors luminosity

5951.36 --> 5956.96
temperatures all these

5953.04 --> 5959.5199999999995
very cute things that are involved

5956.96 --> 5960.32
with the interaction of for example

5959.52 --> 5962.96
sunlight

5960.32 --> 5964.08
with the earth the surface of it that's

5962.96 --> 5965.84
that's where the heat is

5964.08 --> 5967.199
right it's not up there it's not up

5965.84 --> 5969.1990000000005
there it's down here

5967.199 --> 5971.199
on the earth's surface that's where the

5969.199 --> 5972.5599999999995
heat is it's not up there

5971.199 --> 5974.239
when you go up there it's not going to

5972.56 --> 5977.360000000001
be observed heat no

5974.239 --> 5978.239
it's only down here right that's where

5977.36 --> 5981.04
the sun

5978.239 --> 5982.239
light the energy is absorbed not up

5981.04 --> 5985.36
there

5982.239 --> 5988.0
even though hey you know

5985.36 --> 5989.679
when you got a lamp a heat lamp like

5988.0 --> 5992.0
that

5989.679 --> 5993.28
you know i can feel hey there's warmth

5992.0 --> 5994.88
in the room i could conclude yes

5993.28 --> 5995.199
probably because that heater is there

5994.88 --> 5998.400000000001
right

5995.199 --> 6002.5599999999995
right but guess what happens i go

5998.4 --> 6005.679
closer and suddenly

6002.56 --> 6006.2390000000005
i can start feeling the warmth coming

6005.679 --> 6009.52
from

6006.239 --> 6011.678999999999
the proven physical heat source and now

6009.52 --> 6012.56
i can feel it even more i'm getting

6011.679 --> 6015.36
closer

6012.56 --> 6017.84
yeah yeah yeah oh wow it's so warm i can

6015.36 --> 6020.239
literally feel it through my skin

6017.84 --> 6021.76
in my bones oh it's so warm yeah yeah

6020.239 --> 6023.119
yeah that doesn't happen with the

6021.76 --> 6025.52
freaking sun

6023.119 --> 6026.4
that doesn't happen the only heat

6025.52 --> 6029.119000000001
exchange

6026.4 --> 6030.799999999999
is at the ground that is where the heat

6029.119 --> 6034.0
is exchanging

6030.8 --> 6037.1990000000005
yeah the sun is

6034.0 --> 6039.6
not a heat radiator

6037.199 --> 6041.839999999999
in a physical space that you can

6039.6 --> 6051.84
approach and then it grows warmer

6041.84 --> 6051.84
and doesn't happen you get it

6052.32 --> 6056.0
yeah i urge you to travel to this and

6054.239 --> 6058.159
you go to the freaking sun dude

6056.0 --> 6059.76
why don't you go there why don't you

6058.159 --> 6061.92
step in your freaking rocket and

6059.76 --> 6064.0
splatter yourself against the firmament

6061.92 --> 6065.52
as you believe you're going towards the

6064.0 --> 6067.119
sun and by the way if you're going to

6065.52 --> 6068.96
keep on going

6067.119 --> 6070.32
yeah you're not going to the sun even

6068.96 --> 6072.159
though you think oh i'm going straight

6070.32 --> 6073.92
to the sunset's over there right

6072.159 --> 6075.679
yeah yeah as you're going you go and go

6073.92 --> 6076.719
oh hey wait the sun's not over there

6075.679 --> 6078.719
anymore

6076.719 --> 6081.199
oh why would that be could it be because

6078.719 --> 6084.88
it's not a physical object

6081.199 --> 6088.96
in a euclidean location perhaps

6084.88 --> 6091.04
huh why don't you go to the freaking sun

6088.96 --> 6092.0
and feel the heat off your skin like i

6091.04 --> 6094.239
just demonstrated

6092.0 --> 6097.119
with this proven heat lamp over here why

6094.239 --> 6097.119
don't you do that

6097.92 --> 6104.96
yeah just a hologram then

6101.92 --> 6108.96
that's correct dr gonzo

6104.96 --> 6111.52
just a hologram yeah

6108.96 --> 6113.84
a hologram not a physical object that's

6111.52 --> 6116.88
right call it hologram

6113.84 --> 6120.4800000000005
technology hologram holographic

6116.88 --> 6123.119
light based nature not physical

6120.48 --> 6125.119
based nature light based nature a side

6123.119 --> 6127.759999999999
effect of the light

6125.119 --> 6129.759999999999
yeah the light that is very mysterious

6127.76 --> 6133.6
because it's not originating

6129.76 --> 6137.280000000001
from a specific lamp like object

6133.6 --> 6141.679
in euclidean space there is

6137.28 --> 6144.5599999999995
no explanation for this there isn't any

6141.679 --> 6145.119
it's just a fact that that's the setup

6144.56 --> 6147.84
that we

6145.119 --> 6150.08
are in it makes it really weird really

6147.84 --> 6151.119000000001
confusing especially for a bunch of ball

6150.08 --> 6153.36
presupposing

6151.119 --> 6155.199
religious zealots out there that can't

6153.36 --> 6157.119
even freaking imagine

6155.199 --> 6158.638999999999
anything other than everything being

6157.119 --> 6159.679
just freaking balls oh you see it it

6158.639 --> 6161.6
must be a ball

6159.679 --> 6163.28
you see something it must be a ball oh

6161.6 --> 6163.92
you're looking down there in the

6163.28 --> 6166.159
microscope

6163.92 --> 6167.6
must be balls balls balls everything is

6166.159 --> 6169.36
[ __ ] balls to you

6167.6 --> 6170.8
everything is [ __ ] balls well guess

6169.36 --> 6173.199
what it's not

6170.8 --> 6174.4800000000005
it's a hologram it's not a physical

6173.199 --> 6176.159
object

6174.48 --> 6177.5199999999995
you don't have any proof for that

6176.159 --> 6180.638999999999
physical objects

6177.52 --> 6181.119000000001
don't don't start to deviate from their

6180.639 --> 6184.88
still

6181.119 --> 6188.0
position when you approach them yeah

6184.88 --> 6190.0
no you grow you draw closer

6188.0 --> 6192.48
to physical objects when you approach

6190.0 --> 6193.199
them there's perspective side effects

6192.48 --> 6196.5599999999995
they become

6193.199 --> 6198.799999999999
bigger visually they take up more

6196.56 --> 6201.04
space in your resolution of your

6198.8 --> 6204.4800000000005
observing medium which is your eyes

6201.04 --> 6208.32
yeah all that doesn't happen

6204.48 --> 6211.44
because the sun is not a burning ball

6208.32 --> 6212.48
somewhere in euclidean space it's a

6211.44 --> 6216.32
hologram

6212.48 --> 6220.159
it's a side effect of staring

6216.32 --> 6222.32
in the direction of the light

6220.159 --> 6223.679
that correlates with it that's coming

6222.32 --> 6227.28
from that specific

6223.679 --> 6230.0
angular direction yeah

6227.28 --> 6231.5199999999995
that's what it is that's all i can make

6230.0 --> 6233.84
it out to be

6231.52 --> 6236.639
if you don't like it it's not my

6233.84 --> 6236.639
freaking problem

6241.199 --> 6244.48
yeah where's your proof dr gonzo sounds

6243.76 --> 6245.92
a bit off

6244.48 --> 6248.4
sounds a bit off to your ball

6245.92 --> 6250.4800000000005
conditioning perhaps

6248.4 --> 6252.32
yeah all the balls everything has got to

6250.48 --> 6254.5599999999995
be a freaking ball because there's

6252.32 --> 6256.32
literature and there's pictures and

6254.56 --> 6257.76
there's movies and there's science

6256.32 --> 6261.28
fiction

6257.76 --> 6264.08
billions of freaking fanfic

6261.28 --> 6266.08
movie writer pages about how it's all

6264.08 --> 6269.6
balls does it make it a ball

6266.08 --> 6271.76
no because i already told you the actual

6269.6 --> 6272.320000000001
physical elements when you're gonna test

6271.76 --> 6275.280000000001
it

6272.32 --> 6276.799999999999
how it's absolutely proven not to be a

6275.28 --> 6279.44
ball

6276.8 --> 6280.4800000000005
because balls in physical euclidean

6279.44 --> 6283.759999999999
space

6280.48 --> 6287.28
don't bend away as you approach them

6283.76 --> 6288.96
physical objects don't do that the sun

6287.28 --> 6290.719
and all these holographic bodies up

6288.96 --> 6294.32
there they do

6290.719 --> 6296.4
yeah physical objects don't do that

6294.32 --> 6297.5199999999995
they don't bend away as you approach

6296.4 --> 6303.839999999999
them only

6297.52 --> 6303.84
holograms do that you get it

6314.4 --> 6319.119
it's not even about a sphere ethically

6317.119 --> 6322.719
speaking

6319.119 --> 6325.04
it's about not an object just

6322.719 --> 6327.76
sphere whatever disk it's not even a

6325.04 --> 6330.8
disk it's not a thing it's not an object

6327.76 --> 6335.360000000001
it's a light phenomenon a

6330.8 --> 6338.4800000000005
side effect a hologram that appears

6335.36 --> 6340.159
to observers when you look in that

6338.48 --> 6342.718999999999
direction

6340.159 --> 6344.719
it's like a hologram signature that is a

6342.719 --> 6347.679
part of that light manifest

6344.719 --> 6350.08
arriving to you aren't you that's what

6347.679 --> 6350.08
it is

6350.159 --> 6353.679
shut up don't tell me not to get

6353.92 --> 6360.719
riled up about this this is what i do

6356.96 --> 6363.92
this is my specialization it is to show

6360.719 --> 6364.2390000000005
the surreal of the real yeah oh you

6363.92 --> 6365.76
thought

6364.239 --> 6367.839999999999
you thought everything's just straight

6365.76 --> 6368.56
forward it's just like no most of the

6367.84 --> 6371.4400000000005
books

6368.56 --> 6372.4800000000005
actually condition and indoctrinate you

6371.44 --> 6375.28
with literal

6372.48 --> 6377.04
[ __ ] so that everything to you has

6375.28 --> 6380.96
to be balls

6377.04 --> 6383.92
yeah it's not it's not physical

6380.96 --> 6384.4800000000005
it's light manifest can't even pinpoint

6383.92 --> 6387.36
where it's

6384.48 --> 6388.718999999999
coming from in euclidean space it bends

6387.36 --> 6391.839999999999
away

6388.719 --> 6394.88
when you move towards it yeah

6391.84 --> 6398.08
not physical not a ball not anything

6394.88 --> 6401.1990000000005
not an object a side

6398.08 --> 6403.5199999999995
effect yeah that thing you see

6401.199 --> 6404.48
up there even the stars they're not

6403.52 --> 6408.2390000000005
objects they're

6404.48 --> 6411.28
side effects not primary

6408.239 --> 6414.4
secondary side effects

6411.28 --> 6417.759999999999
of looking in that direction

6414.4 --> 6421.199
from which that light comes in relation

6417.76 --> 6421.1990000000005
to your specific position

6424.32 --> 6432.4
no holy holo doesn't mean whole

6428.56 --> 6434.159000000001
holo means light hologram a picture of

6432.4 --> 6437.679
light hologram

6434.159 --> 6443.5199999999995
picture of light gram

6437.679 --> 6447.36
picture holo light hologram

6443.52 --> 6450.080000000001
light-based picture not physical picture

6447.36 --> 6450.719
not a thing you're staring at an image

6450.08 --> 6454.239
that just

6450.719 --> 6457.84
appears visually as if it

6454.239 --> 6459.36
well it could suggest to suggest to be

6457.84 --> 6461.28
an object that's part of what an

6459.36 --> 6464.32
illusion is a hologram

6461.28 --> 6467.44
right because it's only vision

6464.32 --> 6468.08
it visually appears in some ways it

6467.44 --> 6471.678999999999
might give an

6468.08 --> 6474.96
impression to do something be something

6471.679 --> 6477.6
be at a location somehow but it's not

6474.96 --> 6480.159
because it's not a physical thing in any

6477.6 --> 6483.4400000000005
actual location that you can measure

6480.159 --> 6485.759999999999
can approach can touch

6483.44 --> 6486.96
can have all the the elements that

6485.76 --> 6490.08
encompass

6486.96 --> 6492.32
things being physical yeah it doesn't

6490.08 --> 6493.44
it doesn't it's not physical it's

6492.32 --> 6498.159
holographic

6493.44 --> 6501.199
it's light based only

6498.159 --> 6503.679
and so are solar eclipses yeah it's also

6501.199 --> 6504.799999999999
more confusing holographic effects

6503.679 --> 6507.52
that's right

6504.8 --> 6508.0
yeah because things are just not what

6507.52 --> 6511.84
you

6508.0 --> 6513.119
[ __ ] want it to be with your stupid

6511.84 --> 6516.2390000000005
ball indoctrination

6513.119 --> 6518.88
it's not it's not anything it's

6516.239 --> 6520.959999999999
not [ __ ] balls and it's not a ball in

6518.88 --> 6522.2390000000005
front of another ball giving a shade

6520.96 --> 6525.679
either

6522.239 --> 6526.718999999999
yeah it's holographic it's just [ __ ]

6525.679 --> 6530.159
surreal

6526.719 --> 6533.119
hologram based elements out there

6530.159 --> 6535.199
and i don't know why and i don't even

6533.119 --> 6537.119
know how it freaking works it's too

6535.199 --> 6539.599999999999
freaking surreal to even

6537.119 --> 6540.719
figure out how that's possible i can't

6539.6 --> 6543.52
even

6540.719 --> 6544.88
think of a way how to emulate light

6543.52 --> 6548.0
coming from

6544.88 --> 6550.08
nothing like manifesting to an observer

6548.0 --> 6551.28
not coming from an object i don't even

6550.08 --> 6554.8
know where to start

6551.28 --> 6556.5599999999995
i just know that's what it [ __ ] is

6554.8 --> 6558.639
because there is no proof to the

6556.56 --> 6560.2390000000005
contrary all the elements that could

6558.639 --> 6569.84
disprove that are missing

6560.239 --> 6569.839999999999
they don't exist

6574.07 --> 6577.46
[Music]

6580.84 --> 6587.76
right yeah

6583.679 --> 6590.2390000000005
shut up dude don't be smart [ __ ] just

6587.76 --> 6590.2390000000005
kick you

6590.48 --> 6594.48
all right i'm gonna round out the show

6592.08 --> 6594.48
anyway

6595.119 --> 6598.88
because you guys are just gonna push me

6596.639 --> 6601.52
over the edge and get me shouting some

6598.88 --> 6604.719
more because you have no life

6601.52 --> 6606.719
and that's all you do these days cause

6604.719 --> 6607.679
none of you are here to actually learn

6606.719 --> 6609.36
anything you're just

6607.679 --> 6611.599
trying to present yourself as being as

6609.36 --> 6615.92
smart as

6611.599 --> 6615.92
we love you right sure you do

6621.76 --> 6625.52
right but anyway thanks for coming

6624.639 --> 6629.119
everyone

6625.52 --> 6632.400000000001
i speak the truth do i okay

6629.119 --> 6632.4
dr gonzo sure

6632.719 --> 6637.599
i i do i do do that it's weird to hear

6636.32 --> 6639.84
you say that ever

6637.599 --> 6641.28
ever after everything you've been saying

6639.84 --> 6645.360000000001
in chat before that

6641.28 --> 6647.36
but sure right anyway

6645.36 --> 6648.48
i am rounding out the show so thanks

6647.36 --> 6650.0
everyone for coming

6648.48 --> 6652.0
i hope you liked the show i thought it

6650.0 --> 6655.04
was really good this time very fluid

6652.0 --> 6655.84
no pauses and i need that the freaking

6655.04 --> 6659.199
silence

6655.84 --> 6661.4400000000005
enough silence already enough

6659.199 --> 6663.759999999999
and i'm very glad that i've been able to

6661.44 --> 6667.36
put down the gti

6663.76 --> 6670.159000000001
system situation in a decent way

6667.36 --> 6671.36
and yeah give you all the opportunity to

6670.159 --> 6673.598999999999
actually engage

6671.36 --> 6674.88
and become part of my network if you

6673.599 --> 6677.1990000000005
dare

6674.88 --> 6679.679
this is like too scary with irwin and

6677.199 --> 6680.08
his celestial holograms right because oh

6679.679 --> 6683.28
if you're

6680.08 --> 6685.92
thinking the sun is not a ball of gas

6683.28 --> 6687.759999999999
burning in a vacuum oh that's creepy

6685.92 --> 6689.52
that's dangerous don't want to associate

6687.76 --> 6692.0
with that people like that of course

6689.52 --> 6695.76
have to be part of pyramid schemes

6692.0 --> 6698.4
what because you're [ __ ] yeah sure

6695.76 --> 6701.119000000001
yeah if you're like that then i don't

6698.4 --> 6702.5599999999995
even freaking want you in my network so

6701.119 --> 6704.48
i hope though that there are still

6702.56 --> 6705.52
people out there that don't think like

6704.48 --> 6708.0
that

6705.52 --> 6709.84
and that can actually see the value of

6708.0 --> 6713.199
becoming part of that

6709.84 --> 6714.32
it's offering i don't need to offer this

6713.199 --> 6717.839999999999
you understand

6714.32 --> 6721.119
i'm trying to help i want good people

6717.84 --> 6722.96
to survive through this so if anybody

6721.119 --> 6723.679
wants to contact me about that do that

6722.96 --> 6726.0
on skype

6723.679 --> 6726.0
anyway

6726.8 --> 6732.639
i will be back tomorrow with flat earth

6728.88 --> 6733.92
early bird number 798

6732.639 --> 6735.84
and i'm going to join the flat earth

6733.92 --> 6738.88
debate right after this

6735.84 --> 6739.599
also i almost forgot please also do for

6738.88 --> 6742.4800000000005
now

6739.599 --> 6743.84
support me through the paypal patreon

6742.48 --> 6746.718999999999
crypto wallets

6743.84 --> 6747.4400000000005
super chat and the membership system

6746.719 --> 6750.4
join button

6747.44 --> 6751.598999999999
also almost forgot special shout out to

6750.4 --> 6753.92
brian

6751.599 --> 6754.8
who actually paypaled me yesterday after

6753.92 --> 6758.719
i yeah

6754.8 --> 6760.400000000001
told him i had literally 20 cents left

6758.719 --> 6762.2390000000005
it's kind of bankrupted at the moment

6760.4 --> 6764.879999999999
and he helped me out with like

6762.239 --> 6766.32
28 euros that was awesome thank you so

6764.88 --> 6768.32
much brian you are

6766.32 --> 6770.159
you were a great friend and you really

6768.32 --> 6773.04
saved my neck because that means

6770.159 --> 6775.04
that right right after this somewhere

6773.04 --> 6778.0
during the show i can get some groceries

6775.04 --> 6779.84
and get food

6778.0 --> 6782.239
you very much so please do keep

6779.84 --> 6785.4400000000005
supporting me i still need it i'm not

6782.239 --> 6788.08
rich yet or anything

6785.44 --> 6788.96
still need to survive the coming days
