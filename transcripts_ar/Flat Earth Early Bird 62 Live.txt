3.47 --> 10.200000000000001
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.17 --> 15.959999999999999
early-bird number 62 I'm your host

10.2 --> 20.189
Arwen and that day it's uh it's not as

15.96 --> 24.3
sunny as yesterday unfortunately cold

20.189 --> 27.15
not very windy though and I'm just kind

24.3 --> 36.899
of staying inside got all the food I

27.15 --> 37.469
need anyway yeah it is that kind of cold

36.899 --> 42.18
again

37.469 --> 46.2
what's your cold I think so yeah if you

42.18 --> 52.05
take a look right now at my subscriber

46.2 --> 58.879000000000005
count which is a standard part of my

52.05 --> 66.14
hangout right right underneath here you

58.879 --> 69.27
can see 940 oh my god it has been vastly

66.14 --> 76.59
fluctuating all over the place it's been

69.27 --> 77.67
completely insane it's been up to 986 or

76.59 --> 80.31
something I think

77.67 --> 88.89
and then just would be yeah it was

80.31 --> 91.02000000000001
rammed down up down to 915 it's I just

88.89 --> 95.1
can't keep track of it anymore it's gone

91.02 --> 97.89
completely nuts so but yeah for now it

95.1 --> 100.009
seems to be stuck on 940 it has been for

97.89 --> 100.009
a while

101.82 --> 109.25
and yes I have been deleting some troll

106.29 --> 115.89
accounts because there's a just certain

109.25 --> 119.21000000000001
very obvious social engineering tactics

115.89 --> 122.25
that I think that are being suggested by

119.21 --> 124.35
absolutely evil people through the

122.25 --> 130.29
source probably through the liberal

124.35 --> 133.92
narrative AI system to troll me in a

130.29 --> 137.04
specific way to get me Arwen associated

133.92 --> 143.51999999999998
with certain elements and if that rubs

137.04 --> 147.56
off enough then yeah then I will be

143.52 --> 150.24
tainted by by that social engineering

147.56 --> 152.93
designation constructed for me social

150.24 --> 155.94
wise and people will start to ignore me

152.93 --> 160.26000000000002
because of the cultural implications of

155.94 --> 162.03
those smear associations that are

160.26 --> 163.82999999999998
currently being forwarded now and I'm

162.03 --> 165.989
mainly talking about the whole wizard

163.83 --> 168.3
thing you know at first I thought it was

165.989 --> 170.55
kind of funny because yeah wizards you

168.3 --> 173.34
know it's a funny idea a guy with a hat

170.55 --> 176.25
does tricks it's very smart gandalf

173.34 --> 178.799
pretty cool thought okay yeah why not

176.25 --> 182.34
you know if you take it really literal

178.799 --> 186.299
wizard it is just a person of knowledge

182.34 --> 190.47
and wisdom that's it that's really the

186.299 --> 193.47
source of the word but now now I'm

190.47 --> 198.0
noticing it's being forwarded very

193.47 --> 203.73
strongly that wizardry now Oh

198.0 --> 205.709
came out of nowhere so so sudden I did

203.73 --> 209.79
not expect this oh no

205.709 --> 214.25
suddenly wizardry is being used wrongly

209.79 --> 219.48
in my opinion to describe Mesmer effects

214.25 --> 222.12
described well what all these lovely

219.48 --> 225.48999999999998
lovely ball or religious fanatical

222.12 --> 230.08
trolls call the word salad

225.49 --> 235.51000000000002
and confusion tactics saying certain

230.08 --> 237.82000000000002
things in with a straight face and just

235.51 --> 240.48
rolling out completely broken logic

237.82 --> 243.16
without pointing out it's broken and

240.48 --> 248.39999999999998
people that don't have the skills to

243.16 --> 249.75
deal with complex information will just

248.4 --> 253.78
okay

249.75 --> 256.209
well either they just walk away or they

253.78 --> 259.299
say okay yeah what he said because I

256.209 --> 266.38
don't get it and they call this wizardry

259.299 --> 270.25
now yeah well screw you okay that's not

266.38 --> 275.65
wizardry wizardry is wide wizardry can

270.25 --> 277.75
be anything it's not evil wizardry is

275.65 --> 280.56
not evil it is all about

277.75 --> 285.57
just like with technology technology is

280.56 --> 290.83
wizardry okay it is that is what it is

285.57 --> 294.69
right so when you use knowledge social

290.83 --> 297.46
engineering of psychology of the inner

294.69 --> 299.71
struggles of the average person and

297.46 --> 304.21
statistics then you're not engaging

299.71 --> 308.91999999999996
wizardry you're engaged in Mesmer it's a

304.21 --> 313.87
very specific mesmeric mesmeric is using

308.92 --> 317.23
magic or words or power or intention to

313.87 --> 320.53000000000003
confuse people and to derail them from

317.23 --> 322.42
their natural instincts and mindset from

320.53 --> 326.44
what comes natural to basically

322.42 --> 331.18
reprogram them in into an unnatural form

326.44 --> 333.55
of being and thinking that is Mesmer

331.18 --> 338.94
that is what it is it's not freakin

333.55 --> 344.64
wizardry so stop trying to [ __ ] your new

338.94 --> 349.11
narrative your new lovely Christian

344.64 --> 352.9
Inquisition revival come back [ __ ]

349.11 --> 355.98
about all metals you've always

352.9 --> 359.97999999999996
everything's evil you're just only only

355.98 --> 362.98
only what some freaking book says right

359.98 --> 366.16
only that and your interpretation of

362.98 --> 367.90000000000003
that right so everything is evil unless

366.16 --> 371.83000000000004
you agree with you

367.9 --> 376.69
sounds very familiar no [ __ ]

371.83 --> 379.35999999999996
I Spit on that I Spit on your pathetic

376.69 --> 382.69
attempt to create some kind of new

379.36 --> 385.12
Inquisition mindset that is completely

382.69 --> 389.46999999999997
unnatural why don't you just focus on

385.12 --> 394.41
actual evil and refine your analysis of

389.47 --> 397.45000000000005
the actual evil and stop trying to widen

394.41 --> 401.22
everything to draw everything that's

397.45 --> 404.62
potentially good or useful or a progress

401.22 --> 407.89000000000004
all down the drain just throw it all

404.62 --> 412.12
away so you can reprogram everyone to

407.89 --> 415.47999999999996
think exactly how you want no deviations

412.12 --> 417.67
no real individualism just again the

415.48 --> 420.58000000000004
illusion that you're free as long as you

417.67 --> 422.92
don't fall out of line right right is

420.58 --> 428.16999999999996
that what you want you freaks you bunch

422.92 --> 431.47
of Nazis that is freaking Nazism okay

428.17 --> 436.54
that is just destroying culture

431.47 --> 440.05
destroying abilities erasing it all so

436.54 --> 443.35
you can replace it by the Puritan mind

440.05 --> 446.44
control that is perfectly functional

443.35 --> 447.76000000000005
only under your system that is what

446.44 --> 450.15
you're doing that's what you're trying

447.76 --> 454.81
it's not gonna work okay

450.15 --> 459.03999999999996
screw you if you're gonna try that look

454.81 --> 461.74
and I I love good okay I love the path

459.04 --> 464.86
of Christ it is the only way it's the

461.74 --> 465.99
only thing that I can do that makes

464.86 --> 471.33000000000004
sense

465.99 --> 475.39
but I will call out Inquisition neo

471.33 --> 478.06
feudal religious [ __ ] okay I will

475.39 --> 482.56
call it out and I will fight it

478.06 --> 485.23
I will fight it and I will defend I will

482.56 --> 489.94
end up defending my life against it

485.23 --> 492.04
if I need to this [ __ ] is not gonna

489.94 --> 497.38
happen you know get the freaking creeps

492.04 --> 500.35
out of the way get married kids oh yeah

497.38 --> 504.15
kill all the babies kill them all those

500.35 --> 508.06
people are messed up and they need to be

504.15 --> 510.92999999999995
slapped in the face hard I get it

508.06 --> 514.93
that is evil that is surrender to evil

510.93 --> 518.05
okay that kind of thing but you know

514.93 --> 522.1899999999999
what a person doing lay on hands or

518.05 --> 526.81
anything or figuring out things breaking

522.19 --> 531.1800000000001
through cultural misconceptions exposing

526.81 --> 534.8499999999999
real provable lies all that that's not

531.18 --> 537.4799999999999
wizardry just because it doesn't fit in

534.85 --> 542.44
your freaking religious narrative

537.48 --> 545.71
doesn't mean that it is evil freak your

542.44 --> 548.9200000000001
religious zealot I'm not talking about

545.71 --> 551.5600000000001
just ballers although it is the primary

548.92 --> 553.9
core of it the whole surrounds that you

551.56 --> 556.8699999999999
know the ballers wherever that baller

553.9 --> 560.4399999999999
concept may be in some businessmen in

556.87 --> 562.78
some media person maybe in their their

560.44 --> 566.47
own private time you know they love to

562.78 --> 569.02
fantasize about that yeah these people

566.47 --> 571.69
will feel all of this all everything

569.02 --> 574.09
we're doing everything that we are

571.69 --> 576.2800000000001
throwing out there and all the people

574.09 --> 580.12
that are starting to see through the

576.28 --> 583.18
illusion and the lies and they will go

580.12 --> 586.24
any lengths they will go to absolute

583.18 --> 592.15
lies satanic lengths and perhaps even

586.24 --> 599.32
murder eventually to get their way to to

592.15 --> 602.62
not do not let that lie find ya sink to

599.32 --> 604.87
not let it sink to the consciousness so

602.62 --> 606.91
they know what is actually real what

604.87 --> 611.47
they're actually doing and not just a

606.91 --> 614.55
freaking illusion to put over it like a

611.47 --> 619.03
blanket so you don't have to feel so bad

614.55 --> 622.6899999999999
when you actively and fanatically

619.03 --> 625.6
tribute to destroying everything okay

622.69 --> 627.5500000000001
not gonna allow you to do that if you if

625.6 --> 629.47
you won all these bubbles if you want

627.55 --> 631.0899999999999
your lovely bubbles out of the

629.47 --> 633.76
destruction of the world you're gonna

631.09 --> 637.48
suffer under it you're gonna suffer in

633.76 --> 641.11
your consciousness and until until you

637.48 --> 646.08
literally die from it die from your

641.11 --> 650.04
freakin conscious killing you okay

646.08 --> 650.0400000000001
still a little upset it seems

652.61 --> 666.3100000000001
I'll come since doing all right yeah and

661.149 --> 670.55
just so you know yeah I will will ban

666.31 --> 673.01
every single shitty sock you throw

670.55 --> 679.3599999999999
forward every single one of them every

673.01 --> 679.36
one forever every single one

685.5 --> 688.31
so

691.07 --> 697.759
yeah okay that's hilarious

694.13 --> 700.57
peanuts Clark don't be the 89th grandpa

697.759 --> 705.519
that just sat and waited for Jesus that

700.57 --> 705.519
is genius that is great

706.19 --> 711.139
Constance at this point I don't know if

709.04 --> 714.769
anybody is gonna join me anybody could

711.139 --> 716.6
join me but I hope that you're gonna

714.769 --> 719.0
join me since you promised you would

716.6 --> 721.6700000000001
that would be nice and I'll give you the

719.0 --> 729.259
floor you know it's it's good to not

721.67 --> 731.81
have me rambling constantly what yeah

729.259 --> 736.389
I'm sick

731.81 --> 741.1099999999999
I'm just sick of this this neo

736.389 --> 744.92
inquisitive narrative that is rolling

741.11 --> 747.5600000000001
out you know that is too wide spread and

744.92 --> 750.699
and think about it think about it

747.56 --> 753.649
carefully think about how the the

750.699 --> 755.24
Inquisition would have started up how

753.649 --> 759.47
how that happened

755.24 --> 762.98
first they mention certain things like

759.47 --> 766.3090000000001
oh the obvious obvious evil [ __ ] crazy

762.98 --> 769.04
people child murderers these landlords

766.309 --> 772.66
that bathe in blood and all that creepy

769.04 --> 777.86
[ __ ] right well yeah of course of course

772.66 --> 780.499
but then once people get a Herald up

777.86 --> 783.379
about it you think they're gone just

780.499 --> 784.999
gonna leave it to that to those actual

783.379 --> 789.62
people that actually deserve the

784.999 --> 794.5400000000001
punishment no no they want they will use

789.62 --> 800.029
it to remove knowledge from the world as

794.54 --> 805.939
they have that is what it is so you

800.029 --> 808.91
can't give them free rein you gotta you

805.939 --> 813.3389999999999
gotta agree with taking down the truly

808.91 --> 817.61
bad and then fight back and build a

813.339 --> 820.879
giant spiritual wall against against the

817.61 --> 824.3000000000001
insanity of the aggravating inquisition

820.879 --> 827.4200000000001
that is very likely to spring from it it

824.3 --> 830.92
is natural that it that it does that you

827.42 --> 830.92
need to keep that in mind

843.47 --> 849.8000000000001
right so yeah P Morris is Ben I know

846.44 --> 853.0400000000001

849.8 --> 856.04

give you a lifelong busying therapy so

866.54 --> 870.9499999999999
the day the rest of your life and I will

868.49 --> 874.9

with Nate and a lot of people don't like

1090.85 --> 1095.7099999999998

1114.76 --> 1119.23
how the optical illusion happens on the

1117.37 --> 1123.9089999999999

1119.23 --> 1126.94
then then I took a Moon Moon video as

1123.909 --> 1130.48
the show was going I uploaded and he

1126.94 --> 1133.3600000000001

1133.36 --> 1137.11
on the moon position and the Sun and all

1135.73 --> 1139.48
they asked him oh that all that kind of

1396.86 --> 1402.62
a little bit open their a little bit it

1399.65 --> 1406.3700000000001
it went wildly up and down like up to

four or five times so I went to like

1406.37 --> 1414.4399999999998
nine hundred and eighty five and then

back to 920 just 930

1426.85 --> 1435.8899999999999
I have no idea what the actual number is

1433.31 --> 1439.4299999999998

14-year right now has been like that for

1439.43 --> 1446.1200000000001

maybe the wolfy's and the assignment and

1446.12 --> 1450.53
they don't even notice a subscriber

1450.53 --> 1454.58
the thousands they say oh she I got

1452.48 --> 1456.92
twenty thousand subscribers so I lost

1454.58 --> 1458.75
you know or I gained fifty thousand

1456.92 --> 1461.3600000000001

1589.579 --> 1595.749
gonna be ashamed about it or afraid of

1592.669 --> 1601.3090000000002
it anymore cuz I need this I really do

1595.749 --> 1605.479
because it is my this has become my job

1601.309 --> 1609.589
and it's a tough one has been for a long

1605.479 --> 1614.239
time so it is also a lot of fun but it

1609.589 --> 1617.559
is very tough and can get so tough that

1614.239 --> 1620.179
you can see our win like two days ago

1617.559 --> 1621.62
that's what happens under that pressure

1620.179 --> 1624.1200000000001
any venture

1621.62 --> 1627.3
when you don't yeah when you feel it's

1624.12 --> 1630.3
not going anywhere so yeah it's a tough

1627.3 --> 1634.05
job being a flat earther and you really

1630.3 --> 1638.8799999999999
don't get paid except by the grace of

1634.05 --> 1639.54
good people that surround you that's

1638.88 --> 1641.19
really it

1639.54 --> 1643.56
I mean it's something else on on

1641.19 --> 1645.18
creating hangouts every day we're

1643.56 --> 1646.35
sitting with security measures because

1645.18 --> 1647.5800000000002
you don't want to lose your shadow you

1646.35 --> 1650.73
know that all ideas could have a channel

1647.58 --> 1653.9399999999998
you have a platform and then you your

1650.73 --> 1656.49
you know have to be interacting and

1653.94 --> 1658.74
creating these hangouts every day yet or

1656.49 --> 1661.05
get a schedule it's like a job I mean it

1658.74 --> 1663.63
is really like a job I'm afraid if I get

1661.05 --> 1666.1499999999999
when I get me a computer soon that I'm

1663.63 --> 1668.8500000000001
gonna get motivated angry with somebody

1666.15 --> 1671.46
set up day Oh behaves and all that stuff

1668.85 --> 1674.1599999999999
and maybe do hangouts or myself but I'm

1671.46 --> 1676.38
afraid that I gotta get socked into that

1674.16 --> 1678.5700000000002
and wrapped up and I gotta wanna do

1676.38 --> 1680.25
hangouts like really often and very

1678.57 --> 1682.83
scared [ __ ] me up because everything I

1680.25 --> 1685.68
do right now is on my mobile phone

1682.83 --> 1687.75
so I don't have you know it's a little

1685.68 --> 1690.3600000000001
more looser more free but if I get a

1687.75 --> 1695.91
computer now you got that downer dog can

1690.36 --> 1698.25
I start putting yeah and you can start

1695.91 --> 1699.96
editing videos properly and that kind of

1698.25 --> 1704.64
thing because yellow balls are not very

1699.96 --> 1708.3600000000001
good for that yeah indeed yeah and at

1704.64 --> 1711.48
the same time I have a counter concept

1708.36 --> 1713.31
where I am actually just thinking and

1711.48 --> 1717.98
talking about with mostly with my dad

1713.31 --> 1721.05
about you having a freaking bigger phone

1717.98 --> 1725.01
and I did the thing is I don't want to I

1721.05 --> 1730.1399999999999
I really really really don't want to but

1725.01 --> 1733.17
I have to in a sense like my country is

1730.14 --> 1736.5900000000001
actually forcing me to get one yeah

1733.17 --> 1739.92
that's happening because if I don't then

1736.59 --> 1741.87
I can't do internet banking seriously

1739.92 --> 1744.1200000000001
they're forcing me to get a mobile

1741.87 --> 1745.58
because you can't do it any other way

1744.12 --> 1750.6299999999999
now

1745.58 --> 1752.6499999999999
I don't the internet I'd be like you

1750.63 --> 1755.71
have to use the app

1752.65 --> 1757.69
and if you don't yeah then you can't use

1755.71 --> 1761.32
internet banking it's that simple

1757.69 --> 1763.96
that's sadistic really so can't get more

1761.32 --> 1766.96
railroading than that but that's one

1763.96 --> 1768.82
thing and the other thing is that look I

1766.96 --> 1772.66
don't want to be a guy that always has

1768.82 --> 1775.57
their freaking phone and that I walk

1772.66 --> 1778.0900000000001
around outside staring in my screen for

1775.57 --> 1784.03
an hour I'm gonna jump four in front of

1778.09 --> 1786.8799999999999
a car just kidding and I hate people

1784.03 --> 1793.45
that do that I will never do that yeah

1786.88 --> 1797.98
bad guy don't do it in my present self

1793.45 --> 1800.44
kick you freakin kick your mobile out of

1797.98 --> 1802.78
your head not really looking at it as I

1800.44 --> 1805.15
walk you know because I can before I

1802.78 --> 1807.67
leave I plug my headphones and I look

1805.15 --> 1809.92
for something and I put it in my pocket

1807.67 --> 1811.99
you know if I get a phone call if I get

1809.92 --> 1813.94
a text message a notification and I pull

1811.99 --> 1816.1
it out and I'll take it out but I think

1813.94 --> 1818.23
people like walking walking here without

1816.1 --> 1821.6999999999998
looking the street making the sidewalk

1818.23 --> 1824.98
stepping on [ __ ] and also with water

1821.7 --> 1829.24
because they look at their phone yeah

1824.98 --> 1831.19
like tripping over into a an excavation

1829.24 --> 1835.14
hole in the middle of the sidewalk

1831.19 --> 1838.39
remember that one like a no like a lead

1835.14 --> 1840.96
and just tumble there right into a hole

1838.39 --> 1845.3500000000001
like so still sort of feet sticking out

1840.96 --> 1849.67
that [ __ ] yeah I don't want any part of

1845.35 --> 1852.27
that but as a I guess a business phone

1849.67 --> 1854.8000000000002
it might have its functions because

1852.27 --> 1856.78
normally if I would don't groceries or

1854.8 --> 1858.73
whatever I just say screw that mom I'm

1856.78 --> 1861.28
not gonna take it with me I don't do it

1858.73 --> 1864.75
right now I wouldn't need to but if I'd

1861.28 --> 1867.22
go somewhere new where I've never been

1864.75 --> 1870.07
yeah it could be really handy to have

1867.22 --> 1872.71
kind of a backup map to find my with the

1870.07 --> 1879.12
GPS so I can use the satellites to tell

1872.71 --> 1881.83
me where I am on the right and also for

1879.12 --> 1884.299
internet references so if I'd go

1881.83 --> 1888.0
somewhere and I'm expecting to

1884.299 --> 1890.7
need resources or lookup details yeah it

1888.0 --> 1892.23
would be fantastic to have that now I'm

1890.7 --> 1894.679
pretty much forced to ask other people

1892.23 --> 1897.78
like Oh could you look this up for me

1894.679 --> 1901.0800000000002
that is also kind of annoying so there

1897.78 --> 1903.6
is kind of good reason for me to get one

1901.08 --> 1907.9099999999999
but I just need to be careful not to

1903.6 --> 1910.62
drown in it like start playing games

1907.91 --> 1914.6100000000001
absolutely not god I can already see

1910.62 --> 1917.549
that happening yes back in the day I

1914.61 --> 1920.309
don't know 15 20 years ago when the

1917.549 --> 1924.299
mobile phone wasn't a thing yet you know

1920.309 --> 1926.49
I used to either go a long vacation for

1924.299 --> 1929.04
like a month or two to a place or we

1926.49 --> 1930.84
move from one town to another in Puerto

1929.04 --> 1934.77
Rico you know but I didn't know the area

1930.84 --> 1936.6599999999999
I had to find a library a computer a

1934.77 --> 1939.36
family member that had a computer sit

1936.66 --> 1941.3700000000001
down and pull the map and then grab a

1939.36 --> 1943.83
paper and draw the map that was my

1941.37 --> 1946.3799999999999
smited me I used to draw the find the

1943.83 --> 1948.51
house where we were and take a point

1946.38 --> 1950.5200000000002
from there and throw a little bit on the

1948.51 --> 1954.39
streets of their own little ride you

1950.52 --> 1956.309
know just draw a few miles radius in

1954.39 --> 1957.9
case I get lost and I got to use that

1956.309 --> 1960.299
piece of paper and then I put in my

1957.9 --> 1962.6100000000001
wallet always and then I hear I was able

1960.299 --> 1964.98
to grab my bicycle and just take off and

1962.61 --> 1968.76
I used to write down the main Main

1964.98 --> 1970.53
Street Main Street in Ames and cornice

1968.76 --> 1973.14
intersections just in case I got lost

1970.53 --> 1975.059
and I did get lost a few times I am and

1973.14 --> 1977.5200000000002
I'm looking up the street in the paper I

1975.059 --> 1979.86
said no no it's not here I kept going

1977.52 --> 1982.26
where I said a big Avenue then I started

1979.86 --> 1983.85
there find a street name look in the

1982.26 --> 1986.1
paper and then I'd say like yeah this is

1983.85 --> 1987.6599999999999
where I am you know but with the phone

1986.1 --> 1989.49
you don't have to need no more you know

1987.66 --> 1992.73
it was cool actually yet to draw the

1989.49 --> 1995.79
freaking maps or a paper like physical

1992.73 --> 1998.49
paper with my hand you know not anymore

1995.79 --> 2001.6689999999999
man it's too easy for us now true

1998.49 --> 2004.13
although yeah I I do still like makes

2001.669 --> 2007.0700000000002
notes on paper or and what I sometimes

2004.13 --> 2009.6200000000001
do is kind of primitive I guess is I

2007.07 --> 2017.57
Prince about a map

2009.62 --> 2023.289
of the region that is so none so 2003 I

2017.57 --> 2025.76
guess sorry it is so last last decade

2023.289 --> 2027.89
yeah I find yourself a mobile phone with

2025.76 --> 2031.22
the cheapest plan at least four so you

2027.89 --> 2033.6200000000001
can have I mean you don't necessarily to

2031.22 --> 2035.779
be calling on texting but you'll be able

2033.62 --> 2042.08
to be like you know I need a pure

2035.779 --> 2049.609
internet connection and just with no you

2042.08 --> 2053.5099999999998
say no costs just a regular package like

2049.609 --> 2056.69
you pay you whatever no no no no

2053.51 --> 2059.8100000000004
standard package I'd rather go for a

2056.69 --> 2061.869
prepaid set up so I don't have really or

2059.81 --> 2063.83
monthly money because I don't have it

2061.869 --> 2068.119
that's the whole point

2063.83 --> 2071.119
I got a really really cheap standard a

2068.119 --> 2074.4500000000003
mobile calling phone right now and it's

2071.119 --> 2078.8
it's near to nothing that it costs me

2074.45 --> 2081.95
and I can't afford really anymore so

2078.8 --> 2084.7400000000002
yeah I might be able to get the funky

2081.95 --> 2090.46
phone computer thing that I could use

2084.74 --> 2090.4599999999996
but if that comes with a with a

2090.49 --> 2094.4799999999996
prescription or what's the name for that

2094.62 --> 2098.7999999999997
[Music]

2095.919 --> 2105.83
how do you call that if you are

2098.8 --> 2108.29
subscribed to a paid mobile you in a

2105.83 --> 2110.99
career you know you shoot a career like

2108.29 --> 2114.589
18 t / iPhone or whatever that's not

2110.99 --> 2120.52
what I'm talking to the world for a

2114.589 --> 2123.619
subscription is it the subscription yeah

2120.52 --> 2125.33
yeah I guess this richer or something

2123.619 --> 2128.119
like that yeah alright yeah well I can't

2125.33 --> 2130.94
afford any higher subscription than I do

2128.119 --> 2134.77
right now in this current state so I

2130.94 --> 2137.68
can't afford that even if I wanted to

2134.77 --> 2139.57
plan plan is what you call a year you

2137.68 --> 2142.5099999999998
don't need a mobile plan in order to be

2139.57 --> 2145.96
here to pay monthly here right I can't

2142.51 --> 2148.42
use that but I would really love to have

2145.96 --> 2151.54
well one of those phones with the camera

2148.42 --> 2156.4
function especially that would be really

2151.54 --> 2158.74
convenient yeah but you use it I could

2156.4 --> 2160.54
do a livestream from my roof and just

2158.74 --> 2162.25
show everyone yeah yeah I'm on the

2160.54 --> 2164.32
freaking roof look at there look at

2162.25 --> 2167.71
there that will be awesome yeah yeah

2164.32 --> 2171.67
well that's something I can only do if I

2167.71 --> 2174.609
get one of these mobiles or a separate

2171.67 --> 2176.17
camera with live stream functions well

2174.609 --> 2179.109
good luck with that that's probably

2176.17 --> 2182.26
gonna cost me 20 times more to do that

2179.109 --> 2185.95
so I'm gonna have to get mobile phone

2182.26 --> 2187.69
use mobile for refurbish or something

2185.95 --> 2190.5099999999998
you don't have to be on a plan or buy it

2187.69 --> 2192.43
in a company in a contract company buy

2190.51 --> 2194.8590000000004
from somebody that you can use it with

2192.43 --> 2197.23
Wi-Fi and whatever you can reach the

2194.859 --> 2198.369
Wi-Fi signal then with the Wi-Fi you can

2197.23 --> 2200.28
connect to the internet you can

2198.369 --> 2202.839
correctly YouTube with shriman

2200.28 --> 2204.2200000000003
possibilities and stuff that's what you

2202.839 --> 2206.589
need yeah you don't need a plan for

2204.22 --> 2210.16
calling and texting you know you just

2206.589 --> 2212.23
need a smart phone that if there has a

2210.16 --> 2216.16
camera and access to the internet and

2212.23 --> 2218.53
all that stuff jeepers you know if you

2216.16 --> 2221.98
look for it and either I don't know some

2218.53 --> 2224.02
classified or in Google and you're

2221.98 --> 2228.369
placing correctly it's something you

2224.02 --> 2232.869
know I'm there maybe phones and Internet

2228.369 --> 2235.75
yeah you're literally you could eat

2232.869 --> 2237.369
yourself to death on mobile phones yeah

2235.75 --> 2239.77
any day of the week you want here

2237.369 --> 2242.98
because there's so many of them and yet

2239.77 --> 2248.44
a Dutch guy here earlier Alex out of

2242.98 --> 2251.43
magic says in touch I'm 10 years ago but

2248.44 --> 2254.52
yeah that's not gonna work because they

2251.43 --> 2259.27
don't yet it's a whole thing no apps

2254.52 --> 2261.25
yeah but I I would buy it specifically

2259.27 --> 2266.28
for those freaking apps that's the whole

2261.25 --> 2268.59
point of it and yeah if I only have a

2266.28 --> 2270.36
camera that it's gonna be a 10 camera

2268.59 --> 2277.13
off ten years ago you really think

2270.36 --> 2280.32
that's gonna be good already so ya know

2277.13 --> 2285.96
the thing that I want is a mobile but I

2280.32 --> 2290.1000000000004
don't want a take away your entire life

2285.96 --> 2292.11
mobile cellular where like everything

2290.1 --> 2294.81
you do every single thing you do is

2292.11 --> 2296.94

how it works you got to put a key code

2470.329 --> 2473.8390000000004
if you miss the code then the phone will

2472.279 --> 2476.599
take a screenshot and send it to your

2723.26 --> 2726.98
it wasn't me some big misunderstanding

2724.67 --> 2730.76
he got he he got his way of thinking

2726.98 --> 2733.46
he's really rough of the approach is

2730.76 --> 2737.0200000000004
really hardcore for many people I don't

2733.46 --> 2739.57
get it I don't like the approach but

2737.02 --> 2744.35
entitled to their opinion you know our

2739.57 --> 2746.2400000000002
ocean the way he I don't know I mean he

2744.35 --> 2748.3689999999997
can sound very racist to many people

2746.24 --> 2751.31
yeah well I don't call me horrible or I

2748.369 --> 2753.56
call it dismissive and overgeneralizing

2751.31 --> 2757.46
that's not hardcore at all when you're

2753.56 --> 2761.21
actually hardcore you get to the real

2757.46 --> 2763.76
details that are really dangerous that

2761.21 --> 2767.42
is hardcore what he does just spouting

2763.76 --> 2770.1800000000003
out over generalized racist crap is not

2767.42 --> 2774.56
hardcore it's just stupid sorry sorry

2770.18 --> 2775.5499999999997
Eric that's my yeah everybody got their

2774.56 --> 2777.7999999999997
opinion that's what I tell them you know

2775.55 --> 2779.6000000000004
so I mean just lets leave the beep I

2777.8 --> 2781.9100000000003
don't want this in inspiring you know we

2779.6 --> 2782.9
can we can work better together you know

2781.91 --> 2784.7999999999997
if we disagree

2782.9 --> 2786.33
commenting what'd you say if you

2784.8 --> 2788.61
disagree with me don't you don't have to

2786.33 --> 2790.19
blast me I don't have to be blasting you

2788.61 --> 2794.55
you know so yeah you thought you know

2790.19 --> 2798.51
unfortunately I don't really have any

2794.55 --> 2801.6000000000004
tolerance for real benign racist

2798.51 --> 2804.51
expressions like that I guess I am too

2801.6 --> 2806.73
much liberal deep inside to have that

2804.51 --> 2809.82
yeah are you waited but way too far I

2806.73 --> 2811.62
told him if you don't stop this now it's

2809.82 --> 2812.6400000000003
never gonna be all right again what

2811.62 --> 2819.2
you're doing now is absolutely

2812.64 --> 2822.66
intolerable like nobody you know

2819.2 --> 2823.68
pissed off you've seen me pissed off but

2822.66 --> 2828.39
I'm not gonna do that

2823.68 --> 2830.5499999999997
it's idiotic it is what P Mars did well

2828.39 --> 2831.47
look where it got him okay everybody

2830.55 --> 2834.1800000000003
hates him though

2831.47 --> 2838.14
nobody's gonna allow him on except for

2834.18 --> 2840.93
well troll hangouts whatever and yeah

2838.14 --> 2843.9
you don't go there it's just ridiculous

2840.93 --> 2846.62
you know to have these ideas okay that's

2843.9 --> 2851.07
that's your issue if you're just gonna

2846.62 --> 2854.3399999999997
act out on that just like that go that

2851.07 --> 2855.84
far yeah some lines when you cross them

2854.34 --> 2859.4100000000003
you can't go back

2855.84 --> 2861.1800000000003
not really then you've shown that you're

2859.41 --> 2864.48
that that's inside of you and that

2861.18 --> 2867.81
apparently you're okay with that and I

2864.48 --> 2871.17
have non racist wise cross some lines

2867.81 --> 2873.84
myself because yeah if when I get really

2871.17 --> 2877.2200000000003
pissed off I get I I tend to get a

2873.84 --> 2880.17
little bit more file and more

2877.22 --> 2883.5299999999997
descriptive and disgusting in a way I

2880.17 --> 2885.9900000000002
guess but yeah I have to deal with the

2883.53 --> 2889.2900000000004
consequences that people now know that I

2885.99 --> 2892.7099999999996
have that inside of me well at least

2889.29 --> 2895.14
people know that I don't have racist

2892.71 --> 2897.42
[ __ ] inside of me that comes out when I

2895.14 --> 2902.43
get really frustrated I'm very happy

2897.42 --> 2906.4500000000003
about that because that they don't and

2902.43 --> 2909.0899999999997
see that anymore you know if the if

2906.45 --> 2911.04
there was a flat earth game like video

2909.09 --> 2912.9300000000003
game I'll use the primers character he's

2911.04 --> 2914.16
a playable character it's one of the

2912.93 --> 2916.08
create controversy

2914.16 --> 2916.3489999999997
I liked him are somehow if I create

2916.08 --> 2917.8489999999997
fight

2916.349 --> 2920.099
computer I'll invite him to my hangout

2917.849 --> 2921.7490000000003
if he upon bombed an idea I know it's

2920.099 --> 2924.839
him but I don't I mean I don't know

2921.749 --> 2927.2389999999996
whatever yeah I like Elias playable

2924.839 --> 2929.279
characters from trouble sure or not at

2927.239 --> 2932.13
least they're not just the generic 12

2929.279 --> 2934.41
you know team Arthas own planet you know

2932.13 --> 2937.559
we should we should have like a space

2934.41 --> 2939.68
exploration game and then you run into

2937.559 --> 2944.2200000000003
new planets that are named after

2939.68 --> 2945.989
notorious ballers like somebody here and

2944.22 --> 2947.8689999999997
dad I got ya that's peanuts with lark oh

2945.989 --> 2953.299
yeah

2947.869 --> 2959.7000000000003
what it is hello hey how do I sound

2953.299 --> 2962.729
sound pretty good good good man I I

2959.7 --> 2965.22
tried to catch you earlier on skype

2962.729 --> 2967.71
because I'm actually getting ready for

2965.22 --> 2972.089
work but uh you send me the link so I

2967.71 --> 2974.729
released more to come say hey and was

2972.089 --> 2976.489
was in the chat and he asked me to come

2974.729 --> 2987.14
on I guess he wanted to ask me about

2976.489 --> 2988.41
longitude and latitude on that subject

2987.14 --> 2991.44
yes

2988.41 --> 2994.069
so that's Clark why are you on this

2991.44 --> 2994.069
other hemisphere

2997.94 --> 3005.079
well I don't

3000.65 --> 3010.19
this was asking that that was actually

3005.079 --> 3014.9790000000003
jazz akanda asking me yesterday you're

3010.19 --> 3014.9790000000003
on the southern hemisphere right no

3015.039 --> 3026.7490000000003
that's right that's right he did do that

3017.42 --> 3028.609
uh yeah silly mood yeah this is a pretty

3026.749 --> 3031.43
positional argument you know if you

3028.609 --> 3033.71
think it's a shape that you are on and

3031.43 --> 3036.319
then you wrap it around or whatever then

3033.71 --> 3038.96
you can trick somebody into answering

3036.319 --> 3040.969
these questions but this is I think it's

3038.96 --> 3043.219
[ __ ] is just a psychological little

3040.969 --> 3046.4790000000003
war they got with themselves

3043.219 --> 3047.9700000000003
I don't know it's a religious

3046.479 --> 3051.06
presumption

3047.97 --> 3054.5099999999998
that is standard cultural for them to do

3051.06 --> 3056.19
it's become the norm and I don't think

3054.51 --> 3058.1090000000004
that even when they talk about northern

3056.19 --> 3062.07
and southern hemisphere they don't even

3058.109 --> 3065.7599999999998
think about the ball necessarily it's

3062.07 --> 3068.55
very easy to then use that standpoint to

3065.76 --> 3070.71
migrate into ball thinking but I don't

3068.55 --> 3072.57
even realize it just like when we say

3070.71 --> 3073.95
north of the Equator south of the

3072.57 --> 3076.0800000000004
Equator northern hemisphere southern

3073.95 --> 3082.31
hemisphere just as a habit we don't

3076.08 --> 3082.31
really think ball when we say that but

3082.34 --> 3090.75
yeah well and it's kind of like I forgot

3089.4 --> 3094.53
who said it but I think it was Nathan

3090.75 --> 3097.14
maybe but pretty much every time a

3094.53 --> 3100.8300000000004
Glover you know makes a state it's a

3097.14 --> 3104.609
presupposition that you're on a club yep

3100.83 --> 3106.77
I mean just like that question you asked

3104.609 --> 3111.15
me we're on the southern hemisphere

3106.77 --> 3114.359
right that's pursue assuming that there

3111.15 --> 3116.9700000000003
is a bottom half of a sphere well the

3114.359 --> 3120.65
word implies it but the thought that

3116.97 --> 3124.2
sprang the word does not necessarily see

3120.65 --> 3127.4100000000003
so it's a built in cultural trick

3124.2 --> 3129.89
suggestive trick as part of language

3127.41 --> 3132.39
it's been designed that way to do that

3129.89 --> 3133.71
but people that say northern hemisphere

3132.39 --> 3137.04
southern hemisphere they don't

3133.71 --> 3139.109
necessarily think of the ball you just

3137.04 --> 3144.349
think of that region the two different

3139.109 --> 3144.3489999999997
regions around surrounding the equator I

3144.68 --> 3148.859
want to shout out they'd although an

3147.599 --> 3150.9900000000002
artist art goes really quick

3148.859 --> 3153.15
vishay have you make that really concise

3150.99 --> 3158.58
video explaining your theory on from the

3153.15 --> 3160.109
Aristarchus thank you shout out to PJ

3158.58 --> 3161.8489999999997
I'm still yeah I don't want to go

3160.109 --> 3163.95
through a hundred hours of hangouts

3161.849 --> 3167.339
explaining this I got I wanted something

3163.95 --> 3170.52
solid in it yeah yeah I'm starting for

3167.339 --> 3173.88
him to do the actual Aristarchus moon

3170.52 --> 3176.97
crater pattern Photoshop layover

3173.88 --> 3179.04
comparison to actually prove that that

3176.97 --> 3180.549
fractal that he claims that the Sun

3179.04 --> 3182.529
becomes

3180.549 --> 3184.869
when you go up really high that that is

3182.529 --> 3187.179
the same fractal of the Aristarchus

3184.869 --> 3190.509
crater well when is he actually now

3187.179 --> 3194.289
gonna basically compare the Photoshop

3190.509 --> 3196.469
layovers of these images to prove that I

3194.289 --> 3199.779
was actually the case as he claims

3196.469 --> 3203.859
visually on the spots so why don't you

3199.779 --> 3207.099
actually get some proof I explain to you

3203.859 --> 3209.589
exactly how to do it so the only one

3207.099 --> 3212.589
that is preventing that from happening

3209.589 --> 3216.179
and manifesting and progressing your

3212.589 --> 3220.5589999999997
proof and your theories is you Pete

3216.179 --> 3225.579
you're the grumbles I just like rumpus

3220.559 --> 3233.619
has promised to do something over almost

3225.579 --> 3236.079
II almost one year our if darkest is the

3233.619 --> 3239.109
single source of light for all luminary

3236.079 --> 3241.569
yeah it sounds pretty in words but can I

3239.109 --> 3243.219
see this you know I don't know

3241.569 --> 3249.459
illustrations of these how it works

3243.219 --> 3252.7290000000003
please okay he says he has done it just

3249.459 --> 3256.0589999999997
not in a short concise video well that's

3252.729 --> 3259.4489999999996
really nice Pete so if you know where

3256.059 --> 3262.179
you actually did it take the video put

3259.449 --> 3266.319
it in a video editor and cut away all

3262.179 --> 3271.6890000000003
the crap so you can make a concise video

3266.319 --> 3273.519
out of it and show that excuses you can

3271.689 --> 3275.3799999999997
leave the intro introduction or using

3273.519 --> 3280.66
your ma thinking my way with the guitar

3275.38 --> 3283.3900000000003
thank you I know that you know a lot of

3280.66 --> 3286.569
people give Pichet a lot of [ __ ] but I

3283.39 --> 3289.3289999999997
like I try to understand oh boy

3286.569 --> 3290.65
yes they must I say controversial

3289.329 --> 3291.819
characters you know he's one of the

3290.65 --> 3293.7090000000003
controversial Caturday he's got an

3291.819 --> 3295.449
opinion on whatever subjects that are

3293.709 --> 3297.279
not interested I don't agree with but

3295.449 --> 3302.109
his food you know he's an entertaining

3297.279 --> 3304.749
character so I it's a mixed blessing and

3302.109 --> 3305.39
a curse because peach a can be nice guy

3304.749 --> 3309.2599999999998
any

3305.39 --> 3312.02
be absolutely unbearable especially when

3309.26 --> 3314.9
he starts yelling and screaming like a

3312.02 --> 3317.18
little whiny girl that is just like I

3314.9 --> 3320.2400000000002
can't believe you allow that to happen

3317.18 --> 3323.33
to yourself in public it's just beyond

3320.24 --> 3327.25
embarrassing other than that yeah no

3323.33 --> 3329.45
he's just a speculator guy that

3327.25 --> 3331.91
speculates all over the place

3329.45 --> 3334.22
unfortunately the range of his

3331.91 --> 3336.14
speculation is pretty narrow since he

3334.22 --> 3340.58
seems to always be speculating about the

3336.14 --> 3348.95
same things that's kind of a yeah a

3340.58 --> 3352.5499999999997
minor flaw I'll be civil to him but yeah

3348.95 --> 3356.39
when he goes on for [ __ ] I will like

3352.55 --> 3359.03
okay good Jimmy Logan do you subscribe

yeah he's Hank you know he's cool it's

3365.66 --> 3373.43
respectful in chat so shout out to him

3367.37 --> 3374.93
you wanna join your show one day gonna

3373.43 --> 3377.87
be interrupt you

3374.93 --> 3382.18
yeah no it's okay I just trying to take

3377.87 --> 3384.62
it off of TJ a little bit but uh I

3382.18 --> 3386.1499999999996
wanted to ask y'all before I go cuz I'm

3384.62 --> 3390.77
I'm actually I'm getting ready for my

3386.15 --> 3393.65
slave job I want to ask y'all about Owen

3390.77 --> 3398.18
Benjamin and I I don't really I don't

3393.65 --> 3401.87
really see the big deal to me it doesn't

3398.18 --> 3404.6
really seem like I don't see what

3401.87 --> 3406.6099999999997
everybody else is seeing do you do you

3404.6 --> 3409.69
want you can somebody enlighten me on

3406.61 --> 3413.27
why what are you seeing

3409.69 --> 3415.4900000000002
yeah that's what I'm asking what is

3413.27 --> 3418.55
everybody seeing about all visions that

3415.49 --> 3421.43
is so great I don't understand it well

3418.55 --> 3425.7200000000003
not well it's his connections it's where

3421.43 --> 3428.12
he's been admitted to go apparently he

3425.72 --> 3434.0099999999998
seems to have been chosen at least by

3428.12 --> 3438.39
Alex Jones to be part to be a midpoint

3434.01 --> 3442.8900000000003
and that is very important it gave me

3438.39 --> 3445.14
like like almost like what so he's

3442.89 --> 3449.58
actually trying now they're actually

3445.14 --> 3451.77
getting somebody in that engages in that

3449.58 --> 3454.77
type of reasoning he's no longer just

3451.77 --> 3457.14
crapping all over it because yeah

3454.77 --> 3462.48
will you everybody remembers the time

3457.14 --> 3468.45
way back when Owen Schroyer and his name

3462.48 --> 3471.72
again yeah forgot his name they did the

3468.45 --> 3477.56
other Flat Earth guy this is stupid

3471.72 --> 3480.4199999999996
it's pretty widely known come on guys

3477.56 --> 3482.5499999999997
Betty Bravo yeah Eddie Bravo that's the

3480.42 --> 3484.71
guy yeah and Eddie Bravo did their thing

3482.55 --> 3486.869
that was like really Wow what's going on

3484.71 --> 3489.81
and obviously like the unifor screw was

3486.869 --> 3493.29
defending the ball the best they could

3489.81 --> 3495.09
and not getting too evil about it of

3493.29 --> 3497.609
course but this is different because

3495.09 --> 3501.42
this is a guy that just talks about it

3497.609 --> 3503.73
even live stream during enforce air time

3501.42 --> 3507.09
talked about not believing the moon land

3503.73 --> 3509.46
could even be possible for no reasons he

3507.09 --> 3514.77
hasn't disclosed in that specific stream

3509.46 --> 3518.4
but to have somebody as now a a person

3514.77 --> 3520.32
that is part of well the the enforce

3518.4 --> 3523.05
crew and has presentations and

3520.32 --> 3525.75
everything and he does delve into this

3523.05 --> 3530.6090000000004
subject that is remarkable I never

3525.75 --> 3533.16
expected that to happen for for Alex to

3530.609 --> 3535.2
basically decide to move another step in

3533.16 --> 3537.1499999999996
that direction and that is kind of what

3535.2 --> 3540.21
is so special about it and he's a pretty

3537.15 --> 3542.84
smart guy and he seems to be pretty

3540.21 --> 3545.28
decent he doesn't have any weird

3542.84 --> 3547.17
oddities to him that he's like oh yeah

3545.28 --> 3549.3590000000004
and I just happen to be a really

3547.17 --> 3550.83
fanatical pretty good nor something you

3549.359 --> 3554.18
know there was another guy like that

3550.83 --> 3557.5499999999997
before that that was like that and just

3554.18 --> 3560.77
know this guy seems just maybe a decent

3557.55 --> 3562.42
fellow and yeah there seems to be a new

3560.77 --> 3563.89
connection be made and everyone's

3562.42 --> 3566.02
looking like oh what's gonna happen

3563.89 --> 3568.47
what's gonna happen can I get to this

3566.02 --> 3571.42
guy can I talk to him like maybe I could

3568.47 --> 3573.91
see if I could convey a message to him

3571.42 --> 3574.51
and he might be able to move that

3573.91 --> 3577.93
forward

3574.51 --> 3580.1200000000003
up the ladder basically so I think

3577.93 --> 3584.3799999999997
that's why everyone so enthusiastic

3580.12 --> 3587.7999999999997
about it maybe I maybe I need to just

3584.38 --> 3591.07
kind of sit down unbiased and and listen

3587.8 --> 3595.03
to some of his streams because I watched

3591.07 --> 3599.2000000000003
one stream the other night and all I saw

3595.03 --> 3602.92
was him chucking down beers he poked the

3599.2 --> 3607.6299999999997
fire a little bit and banned a bunch of

3602.92 --> 3609.07
people you know and I don't know it just

3607.63 --> 3612.9100000000003
to me it just didn't really resonate

3609.07 --> 3617.65
with me I don't see what I don't what

3612.91 --> 3619.62
was this we're talking about what are we

3617.65 --> 3621.4
talking about we were talking about

3619.62 --> 3625.54
Benjamin right

3621.4 --> 3627.73
oh okay so who did he been or just

3625.54 --> 3629.44
people making comments and it's what and

3627.73 --> 3629.98
what kind of comments may be more

3629.44 --> 3634.42
specific

3629.98 --> 3637.81
Oh flatterer 30 bothers social justice

3634.42 --> 3641.05
warriors or what yeah so social justice

3637.81 --> 3644.32
warriors you know just people know sand

3641.05 --> 3645.9700000000003
um so oh my god somebody banned the

3644.32 --> 3651.88
social justice warrior who could have

3645.97 --> 3653.41
ever imagined that to happen here well

3651.88 --> 3660.52
I'm just trying to I'm trying to

3653.41 --> 3662.5299999999997
understand why I don't know I guess I

3660.52 --> 3665.98
just don't see the big deal on what

3662.53 --> 3669.73
everybody else sees because some of the

3665.98 --> 3673.42
stuff that he said I didn't really agree

3669.73 --> 3677.26
with and I just didn't think it was the

3673.42 --> 3679.81
right way to me came off as just a drunk

3677.26 --> 3681.8500000000004
person there cusses a lot and he calls

3679.81 --> 3684.79
himself a Christian does the same way I

3681.85 --> 3686.17
see bailing his his shed rice raging

3684.79 --> 3688.09
through everybody that doesn't agree

3686.17 --> 3690.07
with him I got all my accounts banned in

3688.09 --> 3690.6400000000003
Dale beyond a value not occurring or

3690.07 --> 3693.07
water

3690.64 --> 3695.2
yeah if you if you've seen

3693.07 --> 3698.6800000000003
one of Dale's shows and you've seen them

3695.2 --> 3701.14
all it's not nothing there are some

3698.68 --> 3702.54
special episodes in there I tend to be

3701.14 --> 3705.7
part of those nine notes by the way so

3702.54 --> 3709.66
take a look what I think that the whole

3705.7 --> 3711.7
rage thing and to get like are you sure

3709.66 --> 3715.48
about this now with that rage

3711.7 --> 3717.6099999999997
no dude that is almost critical it's

3715.48 --> 3719.71
almost the proof that you're not a pure

3717.61 --> 3722.7400000000002
actor because you have actual passion

3719.71 --> 3726.28
that you can't really fake can't really

3722.74 --> 3728.5899999999997
fake it you can act more energetic but

3726.28 --> 3731.01
if it is fake it will show and so I

3728.59 --> 3733.8700000000003
think that a lot of people appreciate

3731.01 --> 3738.9100000000003
people that will get outraged for real

3733.87 --> 3741.5499999999997
in that sense what I did the same three

3738.91 --> 3743.7
days ago now I really raged and that was

3741.55 --> 3746.4100000000003
real and it was really pissed off and

3743.7 --> 3751.14
despite every time I look at it I feel

3746.41 --> 3755.5
so embarrassed it was justified and

3751.14 --> 3757.48
people do see that it is real so I don't

3755.5 --> 3760.39
I don't see the problem you know as long

3757.48 --> 3763.69
as he doesn't go just full-on or crazy

3760.39 --> 3767.5
and racist or something like let me let

3763.69 --> 3771.55
me ask you this Arwen would you would

3767.5 --> 3773.92
you rather people like you know other

3771.55 --> 3776.98
people out there that still believe they

3773.92 --> 3781.2000000000003
live on a space monkey ball would you

3776.98 --> 3785.2
rather those people organically find

3781.2 --> 3788.8599999999997
flat earth on themselves or would you

3785.2 --> 3790.45
rather some type of Idol bring it to

3788.86 --> 3793.27
their attention and shove it down their

3790.45 --> 3799.0299999999997
throat which which way is going to make

3793.27 --> 3801.31
a better a better mind I don't want to

3799.03 --> 3803.26
say a better person because click

3801.31 --> 3805.54
clearly we have some bad people in fire

3803.26 --> 3808.42
but what what is gonna make a better

3805.54 --> 3812.59
mind for Humanity which would mean

3808.42 --> 3816.2200000000003
nothing the people have their mind and

3812.59 --> 3818.67
their mind we'll bring them to the

3816.22 --> 3823.66
frequency that their mind is tuned into

3818.67 --> 3825.85
so yeah a positive nobody so this is how

3823.66 --> 3826.5989999999997
it works people go and look for things

3825.85 --> 3829.5989999999997
that resin

3826.599 --> 3833.529
with them if you're a really nice sweet

3829.599 --> 3835.599
innocent Christian type person or any

3833.529 --> 3837.91
religion or whatever you're really nice

3835.599 --> 3840.069
yet you're not gonna go for the troll

3837.91 --> 3841.839
[ __ ] okay you're gonna go to other

3840.069 --> 3844.119
people and then you might find it

3841.839 --> 3846.009
another Christian that says hey did you

3844.119 --> 3849.579
realize that the earth may actually be

3846.009 --> 3851.829
flat and that's their way and then you

3849.579 --> 3854.1090000000004
got two crazy people that are just out

3851.829 --> 3857.2290000000003
for excitement or that just chronically

3854.109 --> 3859.72
bored all the time and they will go to

3857.229 --> 3862.0589999999997
the troll channels and they might bump

3859.72 --> 3864.64
into Flat Earth and then embrace it for

3862.059 --> 3867.9990000000003
different reasons they may embrace it

3864.64 --> 3871.109
for shock value everybody will find

3867.999 --> 3875.3799999999997
their own route everybody has their own

3871.109 --> 3877.299
angle into it basically whether they end

3875.38 --> 3882.67
up against it or for it is another

3877.299 --> 3884.88
matter but I just don't agree that it is

3882.67 --> 3887.41
kind of like what Patricia says and it

3884.88 --> 3890.619
sometimes I doubt a little about it but

3887.41 --> 3895.6299999999997
any attention is good attention even if

3890.619 --> 3897.309
it is of the worst kind you know so I

3895.63 --> 3901.059
like to load up all of my sergeant love

3897.309 --> 3902.9500000000003
it yeah yeah shout out to Patricia steer

3901.059 --> 3911.92
don't flatter with another hot potatoes

3902.95 --> 3916.18
and shout out to mark sergeant yeah I'm

3911.92 --> 3920.44
trying to tell you it's it's difficult

3916.18 --> 3923.44
look the the worst things they really

3920.44 --> 3928.44
overall the worst things that happen to

3923.44 --> 3931.869
us to Flat Earth are the people that

3928.44 --> 3934.779
seem to be promising get a lot of

3931.869 --> 3939.069
attention and then certainly turn dark

3934.779 --> 3941.2
or maniacal that is the bad that is

3939.069 --> 3943.599
really what does the damage because then

3941.2 --> 3946.8689999999997
everybody is tuned into their frequency

3943.599 --> 3949.42
and they may be latching on to him and

3946.869 --> 3950.07
then when they go completely dark and

3949.42 --> 3953.28
evil

3950.07 --> 3956.28
sudden those people will accidentally be

3953.28 --> 3958.1400000000003
drawn into that some of them others may

3956.28 --> 3960.1800000000003
just notice like okay this is completely

3958.14 --> 3961.5299999999997
wrong I'm walking away now but there's a

3960.18 --> 3964.29
lot of people that don't have that

3961.53 --> 3966.63
sensibility so strongly developed and

3964.29 --> 3968.34
they will then be dragged into the

3966.63 --> 3973.73
darkness with these people so that's the

3968.34 --> 3977.07
biggest danger consistency is the key a

3973.73 --> 3980.13
flat earther any media person needs to

3977.07 --> 3981.63
be consistent because if they switch and

3980.13 --> 3984.4500000000003
they certainly do something completely

3981.63 --> 3988.32
wrong or how the place that's what does

3984.45 --> 3989.43
the damage and yeah as a flat earther if

3988.32 --> 3991.7400000000002
you do that you're only going to be

3989.43 --> 3992.91
shooting yourself in the foot and if

3991.74 --> 3995.37
you're some kind of controlled

3992.91 --> 3997.14
opposition well then it is obvious why

3995.37 --> 4001.37
you would do that and you will be

3997.14 --> 4003.62
spotted and single out very quickly yeah

4001.37 --> 4007.1
one example would be right the Flat

4003.62 --> 4008.8399999999997
Earth obviously just a meteor career

4007.1 --> 4012.86
person that just happened to stumble

4008.84 --> 4017.57
onto the anti Flat Earth enthusiast

4012.86 --> 4022.94
movement and use that but yeah there

4017.57 --> 4025.52
could be flat earthers they could be out

4022.94 --> 4027.53
I don't want to like make seeds of

4025.52 --> 4029.15
paranoia out of it but yeah there could

4027.53 --> 4035.42
be some people that are just sneaking

4029.15 --> 4037.67
all about our window all about okay well

4035.42 --> 4041.15
I'm the the thing is I'm not even a

4037.67 --> 4044.29
hundred percent sure about many of them

4041.15 --> 4048.38
like for example one person I would

4044.29 --> 4052.88
suspect would be like this was Antonius

4048.38 --> 4056.51
uber ATS but in retrospect I've been

4052.88 --> 4058.9100000000003
looking at some of his stuff like just a

4056.51 --> 4062.21
glance here and there and I'm just not

4058.91 --> 4065.24
sure I'm not sure if that is really what

4062.21 --> 4071.39
he is or if he just really is like this

4065.24 --> 4073.8999999999996
and to be nasty maybe it is just his

4071.39 --> 4077.17
inner need to be nasty sometimes

4073.9 --> 4077.17
that driver

4077.91 --> 4084.729
so it's all a matter of perspective

4081.91 --> 4089.2889999999998
I think there are a lot less controlled

4084.729 --> 4092.019
opposition infiltrant among Flat Earth

4089.289 --> 4096.279
then then most flat earthers tend to

4092.019 --> 4100.989
think hell they called little tail L

4096.279 --> 4102.580000000001
Dale I think you know what you know what

4100.989 --> 4104.709999999999
I'm pissed up about there it's not that

4102.58 --> 4108.0689999999995
he told me to go [ __ ] off or whatever

4104.71 --> 4111.67
sorry no swearing but but really I mean

4108.069 --> 4114.279
if the only approach is the rhetoric the

4111.67 --> 4116.049
philosophy and what you want to see I

4114.279 --> 4118.509
know it has to be presented and I agree

4116.049 --> 4120.069
with him like the water doesn't Bend no

4118.509 --> 4122.83
bendy water no gas pressure without a

4120.069 --> 4124.96
container door if you don't if you don't

4122.83 --> 4126.79
want to even look at videos of foolish

4124.96 --> 4128.5
or analyze him and see what's going on

4126.79 --> 4130.48
because that's pretty much what we have

4128.5 --> 4133.42
he got a show on YouTube we got to see

4130.48 --> 4135.19
him through a screen so what are we

4133.42 --> 4136.9
gonna present him if it's not through a

4135.19 --> 4139.089
screen pretty much you know we're not

4136.9 --> 4141.009
gonna be able to travel through the

4139.089 --> 4142.42
other side or a different continent to

4141.009 --> 4144.609
present him something to bring a

4142.42 --> 4147.369
freaking tree with bendy water you know

4144.609 --> 4149.71
we gotta show offensive you know that's

4147.369 --> 4151.929
what I see I don't see that I say all

4149.71 --> 4154.2390000000005
this approach he has to entertain this

4151.929 --> 4156.4
stuff he used to look at him but he

4154.239 --> 4158.5289999999995
doesn't know how to explain it maybe or

4156.4 --> 4161.17
whatever he just he just got the the

4158.529 --> 4163.599
feel of philosophical part and and I

4161.17 --> 4165.819
agreed 90% without what he say but I

4163.599 --> 4168.099
disagree with he doesn't take any videos

4165.819 --> 4169.929
or pictures into account and it has to

4168.099 --> 4172.33
does one of the most important things to

4169.929 --> 4172.869
look at you know I think he begs to

4172.33 --> 4175.0289999999995
differ

4172.869 --> 4178.15
because I think that he just wants to do

4175.029 --> 4179.830000000001
his thing and he wants to keep it simple

4178.15 --> 4181.69
it doesn't want to get too elaborate too

4179.83 --> 4184.69
complex and he's always been like that

4181.69 --> 4188.138999999999
that's just the way he is you could call

4184.69 --> 4190.15
it dumb but yeah that would not give

4188.139 --> 4194.71
credit where credit is due because he is

4190.15 --> 4197.099999999999
really not that dumb it just doesn't

4194.71 --> 4200.369
like to get too complicated with

4197.1 --> 4202.409000000001
but he can be pretty sure it's mostly

4200.369 --> 4204.0599999999995
when his emotions get really riled up

4202.409 --> 4206.759999999999
and in a way that's when he just loses

4204.06 --> 4208.830000000001
sight of everything it's just Sartre

4206.76 --> 4211.17
submit misjudge things and start

4208.83 --> 4215.03
screaming that's one of his personal

4211.17 --> 4220.29
problems but I don't know he's just not

4215.03 --> 4223.259999999999
an explorer type you know you see what I

4220.29 --> 4226.08
mean you're not a you're an explorer

4223.26 --> 4228.33
type you're a guy that actually has the

4226.08 --> 4230.4
inner feeling the dream of like yeah I

4228.33 --> 4234.51
want to go out there find something new

4230.4 --> 4236.4
I don't think he is and I agree that we

4234.51 --> 4238.38
were not gonna get anywhere presenting

4236.4 --> 4241.29
pictures and videos I agree with that

4238.38 --> 4243.42
but it has to be done because we should

4241.29 --> 4245.67
be able to explain this phenomena that

4243.42 --> 4248.07
the ballers call curvature and it's

4245.67 --> 4250.17
really not but the only way to preschool

4248.07 --> 4252.03
to figure it out is taking foolish and

4250.17 --> 4254.25
video because what else do we have you

4252.03 --> 4256.17
know oh I think he's wrong I think

4254.25 --> 4259.56
absolutely does accomplish something

4256.17 --> 4261.75
because it gives us material that the

4259.56 --> 4264.659000000001
ballers can deal with and we can shove

4261.75 --> 4267.119
it in their face continually and new

4264.659 --> 4268.83
material new things shoving in their

4267.119 --> 4271.5
face and another thing and another thing

4268.83 --> 4274.05
and another thing and that is absolutely

4271.5 --> 4277.409
useful because it will either force them

4274.05 --> 4281.6990000000005
to wake up or to create even worse

4277.409 --> 4285.629999999999
deeper lies within them so let them deal

4281.699 --> 4287.638999999999
with that struggle you know it's better

4285.63 --> 4291.3
than just doing nothing and thus leaving

4287.639 --> 4294.42
them in their safe spaces like that in

4291.3 --> 4296.13
my opinion well I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm

4294.42 --> 4299.58
gonna try to think about what you said

4296.13 --> 4303.27
and I do have to go cuz I I'm actually

4299.58 --> 4308.219
running late for work listen all I want

4303.27 --> 4310.92
all I wanted to say is I I don't want to

4308.219 --> 4312.9890000000005
see of course I can't control this I

4310.92 --> 4316.9490000000005
can't really do anything about it but I

4312.989 --> 4320.4
don't want to see flat earth turn into

4316.949 --> 4323.879999999999
some type of personality contest or

4320.4 --> 4328.5
something and I don't want people to

4323.88 --> 4330.729
forget about the science if you will of

4328.5 --> 4334.57
flatter does that make sense yeah

4330.729 --> 4338.59
but it's already that's dead already

4334.57 --> 4341.349
started three years ago so hey one girl

4338.59 --> 4343.059
one group of people will huge to do the

4341.349 --> 4345.55
personality thing and the other will

4343.059 --> 4348.789
focus a lot on science and there are

4345.55 --> 4351.67
some people in between that's just a mix

4348.789 --> 4356.38
that's not the peanuts Pinkett Smith you

4351.67 --> 4360.01
gotta get up yeah sorry yeah I just I

4356.38 --> 4362.67
just think that you know to the mud

4360.01 --> 4368.889
flutters you know to the Owen Benjamin

4362.67 --> 4373.809
followed don't don't forget why you woke

4368.889 --> 4377.53
up don't forget why you realize that

4373.809 --> 4382.360000000001
you've been lied to and to me it's it's

4377.53 --> 4385.3
made me really not believe anything

4382.36 --> 4388.808999999999
until I can either prove it for myself

4385.3 --> 4393.849
or provide enough evidence to where I

4388.809 --> 4396.249
can use my own discernment does it kind

4393.849 --> 4399.179
of make sense what I'm saying yeah kind

4396.249 --> 4403.959
of really know it is important because

4399.179 --> 4406.57
once the fame or success grows of any

4403.959 --> 4410.139
type of channel there will the

4406.57 --> 4413.259999999999
corruption risk again I talking about

4410.139 --> 4416.469
this for years now at least a year is

4413.26 --> 4418.9890000000005
the the corruption the corruption itself

4416.469 --> 4422.469
when you attain power when you strain

4418.989 --> 4424.78
attain success the corruption risk

4422.469 --> 4427.599
becomes higher the pressure becomes

4424.78 --> 4431.13
higher to forget everything miserable

4427.599 --> 4436.09
and to take to become more egotistical

4431.13 --> 4438.07
that's a natural energy effect spiritual

4436.09 --> 4440.499
energy effect that happens when you

4438.07 --> 4442.989
become successful it's very dangerous

4440.499 --> 4445.749
and some people are very sensitive to it

4442.989 --> 4448.57
others are not so much there's quite a

4445.749 --> 4451.15
few people that actually see that coming

4448.57 --> 4454.509999999999
and that try to prepare for it I am one

4451.15 --> 4456.308999999999
of those people and we'll find out soon

4454.51 --> 4458.709
oh you'll see it in the behavior that's

4456.309 --> 4463.479
a funny thing when this corruption

4458.709 --> 4466.959
SATs in it is visible it is very very

4463.479 --> 4469.719
visible to anyone watching these people

4466.959 --> 4472.15
you can see if corruption is setting in

4469.719 --> 4475.329
you can see it in their in their stance

4472.15 --> 4477.219
in their face if they are in the process

4475.329 --> 4480.369
of corrupting or if they are the same

4477.219 --> 4483.689
you can see it pay attention pay close

4480.369 --> 4488.549999999999
attention to how he is is he

4483.689 --> 4491.559
drifting off is he more radicalizing or

4488.55 --> 4495.429
stepping away from certain subjects in

4491.559 --> 4498.639
favor of the greater audience well we're

4495.429 --> 4500.459
all gonna see it why he's gonna do

4498.639 --> 4503.559
something

4500.459 --> 4507.999
well Arwen Thank You Jose

4527.409 --> 4532.808999999999
celebrate yesterday yesterday was a

4529.389 --> 4535.869
holiday it was Earth's rotation day and

4532.809 --> 4538.329000000001
wise did not celebrate it what is the

4535.869 --> 4541.598999999999
Earth's rotation they are you serious

4538.329 --> 4544.57
yes yesterday was a holiday earth

4541.599 --> 4547.3
rotation day that is how deep the mind

4544.57 --> 4549.57
control goes that's your sweater

4547.3 --> 4551.349
since when I've never heard of that

4549.57 --> 4553.63
that's ridiculous

4551.349 --> 4557.189
since when is that did I just do that

4553.63 --> 4564.639
you just create that never heard of it

4557.189 --> 4567.159000000001
absolutely ridiculous thank you being a

4564.639 --> 4569.349
superhero yes yes sorry peanut thanks

4567.159 --> 4571.688999999999
for for being on the show but yeah you

4569.349 --> 4577.019
shocked me a little bit rotation what

4571.689 --> 4577.019
the hell are you serious

4578.449 --> 4582.409
and I thought and I thought whoa Rico

4580.13 --> 4585.7390000000005
was the most ridiculous holidays we had

4582.409 --> 4589.759999999999
like the Tito trainee that day when he

4585.739 --> 4592.339999999999
beat Oscar De La Hoya in 2000 and the

4589.76 --> 4594.38
dream team of Puerto Rico almost beat

4592.34 --> 4596.900000000001
the dream team of United States in

4594.38 --> 4598.639
basketball in the all-star games you

4596.9 --> 4603.888999999999
know that all that kind of holidays

4598.639 --> 4609.62
weird stuff okay well apparently earth

4603.889 --> 4613.52
rotation day it doesn't even say when it

4609.62 --> 4616.46
started when it's been recognized but it

4613.52 --> 4621.4400000000005
apparently is based when léon foucault

4616.46 --> 4625.7300000000005
uses the focal pendulum in 1851 to prove

4621.44 --> 4630.5
the earth rotates too based on that so

4625.73 --> 4635.12
it's it's it's a foe cult celebration

4630.5 --> 4638.12
day I guess it's the celebration day of

4635.12 --> 4645.88
the fake cult of the ball where you

4638.12 --> 4653.03
where you stopped look like now sorry
