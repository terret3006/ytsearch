5.98 --> 36.32
[Music]

42.559 --> 46.399
good

43.6 --> 49.760000000000005
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

46.399 --> 51.28
number 665 i'm your host irwin

49.76 --> 53.36
and before we start the show please

51.28 --> 54.559
don't forget to share it on any platform

53.36 --> 56.399
you deem fit and

54.559 --> 58.0
if you haven't already subscribe to my

56.399 --> 60.0
channel and hit the bell notification

58.0 --> 61.92
so you know when i'm going live just

60.0 --> 64.96
normally 2 pm amsterdam time

61.92 --> 66.88
every day please also do support me

64.96 --> 69.36
through the paypal patreon the super

66.88 --> 72.15899999999999
chat and membership system join button

69.36 --> 73.28
be much appreciated i could really use

72.159 --> 76.4
some

73.28 --> 79.759
there's some bills piling up

76.4 --> 81.759
so i but i think i shared all that stuff

79.759 --> 82.88
enough for now but yeah please keep it

81.759 --> 86.0
coming

82.88 --> 90.72
uh so the weather today

86.0 --> 95.03999999999999
is again quite beautiful

90.72 --> 98.0
it's very similar looking to yesterday

95.04 --> 98.96000000000001
but it's a little warmer actually like

98.0 --> 102.96
there's not as much

98.96 --> 104.96
wind the wind has been blowing

102.96 --> 109.28
like even throughout the night and it

104.96 --> 109.28
was yesterday night was pretty damn cold

110.399 --> 117.28
like it got really chilly i had to

113.68 --> 117.28
put on my sweater and everything

117.36 --> 125.28
but now it's pretty nice and warm again

120.479 --> 125.28
and the sun is just very bright

126.0 --> 132.64
nice after summer day

129.28 --> 137.12
so late in september already

132.64 --> 139.67999999999998
all right so let's use in chat

137.12 --> 142.0
okay michael o'rourke was first to stop

139.68 --> 145.04000000000002
traffic in my rasta hat

142.0 --> 148.239
random unbelievable productions

145.04 --> 150.72
good servant yeah good to see you all

148.239 --> 150.72
so far

154.84 --> 158.8
right so

160.08 --> 166.16000000000003
yeah i was quite busy yesterday stayed

163.12 --> 166.16
up very late

166.959 --> 174.239
even though i tried not to uh hello

170.0 --> 174.239
hm um

174.56 --> 178.0
right yeah the flat earth debates was

176.879 --> 181.599
extremely

178.0 --> 185.36
long it lasted lasted over like

181.599 --> 188.48
a total is it two and a half hours

185.36 --> 190.48000000000002
so i got an extra long after show and

188.48 --> 191.92
yeah we actually had some ballers on

190.48 --> 194.959
there

191.92 --> 195.51899999999998
like during the normal show the live

194.959 --> 199.12
show

195.519 --> 200.959
there were none but then yeah they

199.12 --> 202.4
started to come in at the end of the

200.959 --> 206.159
show

202.4 --> 209.44
uh i mean like halfway the after show

206.159 --> 214.319
and that was kind of fun and nutty

209.44 --> 214.319
as usual he meant young

214.82 --> 217.94
[Music]

219.84 --> 230.72
pretty good show uh

227.44 --> 230.72
right yeah after that

232.319 --> 239.2
i was yeah i watched the live show from

235.76 --> 243.2
uh rodrigo ferrari nunez again on space

239.2 --> 246.48
with spacecrack another edition uh

243.2 --> 248.64
i got distracted though i think i'm not

246.48 --> 249.76
sure about the exact time slot that was

248.64 --> 254.0
live

249.76 --> 256.079
but yeah rasta had called me

254.0 --> 258.32
maybe that was after it i don't know

256.079 --> 258.88
exactly but yeah the rest of me were on

258.32 --> 262.079
the

258.88 --> 264.15999999999997
on skype on a skype call that in two

262.079 --> 269.759
parts lasted over a total of four

264.16 --> 272.47900000000004
hours it's just crazy

269.759 --> 274.56
but it was very interesting talked a lot

272.479 --> 278.08
about

274.56 --> 282.16
uh about yeah grower stuff

278.08 --> 284.24
a lot of details how that works

282.16 --> 286.24
little tricks that i'm not gonna share

284.24 --> 290.0
personally

286.24 --> 291.199
and yeah also about the bible and about

290.0 --> 294.32
his interview

291.199 --> 296.639
with good servant that it despite

294.32 --> 297.759
the four-hour talk didn't actually get

296.639 --> 300.88
to watch

297.759 --> 303.28000000000003
this i still have to just find a quiet

300.88 --> 305.68
moment to just watch that

303.28 --> 309.35999999999996
but yeah with the call with rasta it was

305.68 --> 309.36
just too distracting to watch that

309.52 --> 315.12
and after that it was kind of knackered

312.08 --> 319.039
but uh yeah i rounded out yesterday with

315.12 --> 319.039
a live show of ironworks

319.84 --> 324.56
and yeah it was kind of funny a bob

322.16 --> 327.03900000000004
nodell was on there

324.56 --> 328.96
and academy too i don't know they seem

327.039 --> 332.639
to now be

328.96 --> 335.12
a regular standard guest there

332.639 --> 338.56
and yeah it's exactly what everyone

335.12 --> 340.479
typically expects

338.56 --> 342.479
but got kind of interesting and i was

340.479 --> 345.84
really active in chat

342.479 --> 347.44
like got really fired up also basically

345.84 --> 351.28
to defend

347.44 --> 354.8
my holographic heavenly bodies concept

351.28 --> 358.88
and yeah constantly cross-referencing it

354.8 --> 360.479
with data with things that are perceived

358.88 --> 362.71999999999997
to be

360.479 --> 364.4
so one of the new arguments i got out of

362.72 --> 366.16
that

364.4 --> 368.479
which was yeah it was funny how that

366.16 --> 371.52000000000004
works it's not super solid but

368.479 --> 373.199
look it said ooh set loons

371.52 --> 375.84
they were a lot talking about satellites

373.199 --> 379.039
and said loons and

375.84 --> 381.71999999999997
and it said that said loons can float

379.039 --> 383.919
up there really super high and they use

381.72 --> 385.199
electrostatics apparently which is very

383.919 --> 388.08
interesting i

385.199 --> 388.479
i didn't know that or forgot about that

388.08 --> 392.84
and

388.479 --> 395.59999999999997
yeah bob reminded me of that

392.84 --> 397.11999999999995
like putting out a wire and then just

395.6 --> 399.44
charging it from the

397.12 --> 400.639
from the electricity and in the sky and

399.44 --> 403.919
that kind of

400.639 --> 407.84000000000003
changed the electrostatic uh

403.919 --> 408.71999999999997
tension the the charge on the object and

407.84 --> 411.919
thereby

408.72 --> 414.24
yeah adding onto

411.919 --> 416.31899999999996
or basically altering the effective

414.24 --> 418.88
relative density it's fascinating how

416.319 --> 418.88
that works

419.84 --> 423.84
but the the thing that stood out to me

422.56 --> 426.96
in the

423.84 --> 431.19899999999996
in that argument in that

426.96 --> 434.15999999999997
data in retrospect later

431.199 --> 436.40000000000003
talking about the sun where it is it's

434.16 --> 438.639
definitely not heliocentric setup and

436.4 --> 440.71999999999997
all that

438.639 --> 442.96000000000004
but yeah what stood out to me is like

440.72 --> 446.16
okay so the air up there is so

442.96 --> 449.599
still right super still

446.16 --> 452.319
okay well

449.599 --> 454.15999999999997
that means that there is not a lot of

452.319 --> 457.52000000000004
heat influence there

454.16 --> 461.199
which is typically what causes the

457.52 --> 464.24
the dynamic gas system on the earth

461.199 --> 467.28000000000003
to yeah constantly mix up and all that

464.24 --> 470.56
the ground level production

467.28 --> 472.71999999999997
of gas and the interactions with water

470.56 --> 473.759
turning to vapor and then back to water

472.72 --> 476.8
again all that

473.759 --> 477.759
right that happens because there is a

476.8 --> 481.28000000000003
heat

477.759 --> 483.599
source that comes and then goes again

481.28 --> 485.44
we know it by day night or mostly the

483.599 --> 488.71999999999997
sun the sunlight right

485.44 --> 492.479
but look if there is a sun

488.72 --> 495.91900000000004
up there like under the ferment under

492.479 --> 500.0
physically there as a heat source

495.919 --> 502.87899999999996
then it would be impossible

500.0 --> 503.919
for balloons to hang up in the higher

502.879 --> 507.28000000000003
atmosphere

503.919 --> 508.31899999999996
the higher air regions in a perfect

507.28 --> 510.31899999999996
still

508.319 --> 511.68
environment because if the sun was

510.319 --> 514.719
passing by

511.68 --> 517.919
up there every day

514.719 --> 520.0
there would also be air flow

517.919 --> 521.5989999999999
aerodynamics there would be change in

520.0 --> 523.36
temperature and

521.599 --> 525.44
yeah all the turbulence effects that

523.36 --> 528.399
come with it well there's not

525.44 --> 529.44
because it is still up there so that

528.399 --> 532.48
kind of

529.44 --> 534.48
gave me extra indirect evidence

532.48 --> 536.24
that indeed the sunlight is just a

534.48 --> 538.9590000000001
holographic manifestation

536.24 --> 539.44
on earth and that up there there is none

538.959 --> 542.399
of it

539.44 --> 542.399
it's just not there

542.72 --> 547.12
it's not coming from a physical object

545.12 --> 549.04
in a specific location

547.12 --> 550.88
because if it was then the inverse

549.04 --> 553.04
square law would start to

550.88 --> 555.12
go into effect that means that it would

553.04 --> 556.64
be very strong at the source

555.12 --> 558.8
if it's very strong at the surface and

556.64 --> 562.08
it's hovering up there that would be

558.8 --> 564.0799999999999
influencing the aerodynamics up there

562.08 --> 566.88
and cause turbulence cause change well

564.08 --> 566.88
there isn't any

567.44 --> 569.7600000000001
okay

574.839 --> 578.48
hmm

576.16 --> 579.279
what do you guys think about that more

578.48 --> 591.839
proof

579.279 --> 591.8389999999999
for yeah non-physicality some

596.24 --> 607.2
what are you talking about

604.8 --> 607.1999999999999
all right

613.2 --> 621.839
where do jet streams come from

616.839 --> 624.9590000000001
what you mean constant wind flows

621.839 --> 626.72
up there i don't know but if they're

624.959 --> 629.04
constant

626.72 --> 629.0400000000001
then

630.8 --> 635.04
yeah that's not coming from a localized

634.079 --> 637.92
heat source

635.04 --> 638.7199999999999
because it's constant or absolutely

637.92 --> 643.76
still both

638.72 --> 645.519
indicate a non-local heat source

643.76 --> 647.2
like it's not a local heat source that

645.519 --> 648.8
goes around otherwise it would be

647.2 --> 650.8000000000001
getting windy and then getting wind

648.8 --> 652.56
still again and get windy wind still

650.8 --> 654.24
again well that's not the case

652.56 --> 656.079
there's supposedly wind streams and

654.24 --> 657.44
there is a region where it's absolutely

656.079 --> 660.7199999999999
still

657.44 --> 663.6800000000001
both are direct signs that there is not

660.72 --> 664.5600000000001
a heat source and a light source

663.68 --> 667.68
traveling

664.56 --> 670.3199999999999
in a specific location as a object that

667.68 --> 674.0
radiates all that

670.32 --> 676.72
that can't be the case or what i just

674.0 --> 689.839
described would be the situation up

676.72 --> 689.839
there and it's not

699.279 --> 703.76
it has a shape what are you no it

702.16 --> 706.24
doesn't have a shape

703.76 --> 706.959
it's just apparent it's a hologram it

706.24 --> 709.44
appears

706.959 --> 709.4399999999999
like that

712.32 --> 715.519
a bunch of spinning winds now now but

714.959 --> 718.4799999999999
look

715.519 --> 720.079
it doesn't matter in relation to my

718.48 --> 723.6800000000001
argument

720.079 --> 725.92
the local heat source it doesn't matter

723.68 --> 728.4799999999999
how you conceive it the only factor in

725.92 --> 732.3199999999999
this case that matters is that they are

728.48 --> 735.279
constant that they always blow at

732.32 --> 737.6
roughly similar speeds those are

735.279 --> 741.519
indications that it's not

737.6 --> 744.9590000000001
caused by heat

741.519 --> 746.5600000000001
being yeah being introduced and then

744.959 --> 748.959
taken away again

746.56 --> 751.04
which is how things work on earth like

748.959 --> 755.4399999999999
at the ground level

751.04 --> 755.4399999999999
due to the day and the night situation

756.839 --> 761.6800000000001
right if it's a constant wind

759.279 --> 763.68
or there is any point higher up where

761.68 --> 766.8
it's just wind still that means that

763.68 --> 769.519
neither regions are directly influenced

766.8 --> 770.4799999999999
by a reoccurring heat source that is

769.519 --> 772.399
locally present

770.48 --> 774.0790000000001
it couldn't be because then it would

772.399 --> 776.959
have another dynamic

774.079 --> 776.959
do you understand

783.92 --> 788.4799999999999
right just imagine it like a heat source

786.959 --> 791.76
could but just be imagined

788.48 --> 794.88
as as a spoon

791.76 --> 798.16
being stirred in a pot well where

794.88 --> 801.36
it is stirring you see you know if

798.16 --> 804.0
especially if it's uh i don't know if

801.36 --> 805.6800000000001
custard or something you see ripples

804.0 --> 808.0
because that's where the pressure comes

805.68 --> 811.04
because it's pushing in this case

808.0 --> 814.399
well heat locally would also push

811.04 --> 817.68
so there would be just a rip off

814.399 --> 821.36
proceeding that specific point

817.68 --> 823.5999999999999
the spoon stock

821.36 --> 825.04
right well that's how it would happen

823.6 --> 828.24
with the sun as well it's not

825.04 --> 832.8
though that only seems to be going on

828.24 --> 836.24
on the earth's surface see

832.8 --> 839.4399999999999
meaning the light of the sun is

836.24 --> 843.279
is not radiating from a specific

839.44 --> 846.24
point in space by a heat and light

843.279 --> 847.76
source that yeah that is subjected to

846.24 --> 850.48
the infrasquare law

847.76 --> 851.8389999999999
because it doesn't it that wouldn't make

850.48 --> 857.839
any sense with

851.839 --> 857.839
what is going on in the realm

859.04 --> 867.36
it's like stirring a cup with a spoon

863.12 --> 870.5600000000001
without a stalk it's just just the spoon

867.36 --> 872.0790000000001
the spoon the bottom part staring down

870.56 --> 874.6389999999999
there with no stock

872.079 --> 876.56
because everything at the top is still

874.639 --> 878.8
that doesn't make any sense

876.56 --> 878.8
see

880.639 --> 884.0
because that's roughly what it's like so

882.88 --> 887.12
this sunlight is

884.0 --> 887.92
just manifesting down here that's where

887.12 --> 890.399
it is

887.92 --> 891.199
not up there so it's not coming from an

890.399 --> 894.639
object

891.199 --> 898.399
as a lamp you would be holding

894.639 --> 900.8
any man-made lights or local

898.399 --> 901.839
light created by a physical object

900.8 --> 904.16
probably

901.839 --> 905.839
is subjected to the inverse square law

904.16 --> 907.199
well that's not the case here with the

905.839 --> 911.1990000000001
sunlight

907.199 --> 915.199
why because it's not a manifestation

911.199 --> 918.4799999999999
arriving from a local object like a lamp

915.199 --> 920.959
can't be because the circumstances that

918.48 --> 922.16
would be the natural consequence of such

920.959 --> 927.8389999999999
a setup are not

922.16 --> 927.8389999999999
present in the realm

931.839 --> 937.44
now i'm asking all of you to just think

935.04 --> 940.079
about what i just said

937.44 --> 940.9590000000001
i'm being very detailed here because i

940.079 --> 944.6389999999999
basically

940.959 --> 946.56
bumped into a new con a new argument

944.639 --> 948.48
for my conceptions of the holographic

946.56 --> 952.8389999999999
globe of the heavens

948.48 --> 955.839
including the sun proof for it if you

952.839 --> 955.839
will

962.079 --> 967.3599999999999
yeah michael rock the wind

965.36 --> 970.0
is caused by the movement of the sun and

967.36 --> 973.6800000000001
moon no no it's not

970.0 --> 977.92
now wind is probably empirically

973.68 --> 979.7589999999999
caused by heat heat alteration

977.92 --> 981.519
one part of the air is hotter than the

979.759 --> 982.0
other it will start to flow to the

981.519 --> 986.24
colder

982.0 --> 986.24
part that's what causes winds typically

986.399 --> 990.399
now it can also potentially be

991.199 --> 994.24
yeah at the constant wind streams there

993.199 --> 996.56
could be some kind of

994.24 --> 998.88
electrostatic situation going on that's

996.56 --> 1001.3599999999999
just like constantly pushing the winds

998.88 --> 1002.56
causing it to perpetually flow it would

1001.36 --> 1005.1990000000001
be of another

1002.56 --> 1006.16
an effect of another source not of a

1005.199 --> 1010.0
local

1006.16 --> 1013.04
light heat source that can't be

1010.0 --> 1014.079
you can't have a constant heat flow like

1013.04 --> 1016.88
that

1014.079 --> 1019.199
or as a constant wind flow at high

1016.88 --> 1021.04
speeds

1019.199 --> 1022.3199999999999
with local heat source that doesn't make

1021.04 --> 1026.0
sense because

1022.32 --> 1030.48
that heat source type of turbulence is

1026.0 --> 1033.919
like a spoon stirring in in something

1030.48 --> 1037.1200000000001
that's how that type of heat

1033.919 --> 1038.5590000000002
aerodynamics work well that's not that

1037.12 --> 1040.6399999999999
that's not hair that's not what's

1038.559 --> 1043.28
happening super still

1040.64 --> 1044.72
air layer then constant wind and air

1043.28 --> 1046.8799999999999
layer constant wind

1044.72 --> 1048.64
and then beneath there where the

1046.88 --> 1050.64
heavenly bodies are visible where the

1048.64 --> 1054.3200000000002
sunlight and the moon hits

1050.64 --> 1057.5200000000002
the earth that's where the spoon

1054.32 --> 1061.039
type of aerodynamics is present

1057.52 --> 1067.84
there only that layer see

1061.039 --> 1067.84
that's the situation here

1078.84 --> 1081.84
so

1083.679 --> 1095.8400000000001
what are you blabbering about agm

1097.84 --> 1102.08
no it's not super close because if it

1099.679 --> 1104.96
was super close then you would have

1102.08 --> 1105.84
signs of a proximity it means you would

1104.96 --> 1108.32
actually

1105.84 --> 1110.9599999999998
be able to go to the sun as you go there

1108.32 --> 1113.36
the angular size of it increases

1110.96 --> 1114.0
the inverse square law would apply and

1113.36 --> 1116.7199999999998
you would

1114.0 --> 1117.919
receive more heat from it as a physical

1116.72 --> 1120.559
source of heat

1117.919 --> 1122.48
in a specific point there is none of

1120.559 --> 1124.3999999999999
that there is no proof

1122.48 --> 1125.76
of approaching the sun i want to see

1124.4 --> 1129.919
that i want to see

1125.76 --> 1133.36
something a balloon being left

1129.919 --> 1135.2800000000002
sent up with i guess extra heat

1133.36 --> 1139.4399999999998
resisting

1135.28 --> 1143.039
electrically electric safe

1139.44 --> 1146.0800000000002
emp safe heat safe a balloon situation

1143.039 --> 1149.679
sent up there send it into the sun just

1146.08 --> 1151.84
where i guess the triangulation

1149.679 --> 1153.76
on the disc presupposition model where

1151.84 --> 1154.6399999999999
it pans out the sun would have to

1153.76 --> 1157.679
physically be

1154.64 --> 1159.8400000000001
well send a balloon up there to meet

1157.679 --> 1161.76
such a point exactly for the sun

1159.84 --> 1163.84
basically to run

1161.76 --> 1166.24
right into it if it is actually a

1163.84 --> 1168.72
physical object in a literal point

1166.24 --> 1169.84
let's see that let's see that happening

1168.72 --> 1172.559
let's see it get

1169.84 --> 1174.799
overwhelmed and blinded because the

1172.559 --> 1175.6789999999999
entire sun is taking up the entire

1174.799 --> 1178.72
screen

1175.679 --> 1179.8400000000001
on one side i want to see that i want to

1178.72 --> 1183.039
have that proof

1179.84 --> 1185.4399999999998
so people can finally make me shut up

1183.039 --> 1188.72
about a holographic sun which is so

1185.44 --> 1191.44
incredibly frustrating to the

1188.72 --> 1192.48
what am i saying to everyone to everyone

1191.44 --> 1195.6000000000001
in the freaking world

1192.48 --> 1198.96
except me it seems

1195.6 --> 1200.799
you know people will be like yeah sure

1198.96 --> 1202.799
it's not proven but okay

1200.799 --> 1204.799
you seem to be doing something with it

1202.799 --> 1207.44
nobody is accepting it just

1204.799 --> 1208.24
nobody is like hmm yeah maybe that makes

1207.44 --> 1210.72
sense

1208.24 --> 1211.36
nobody's trying to disprove it or prove

1210.72 --> 1214.84
it

1211.36 --> 1217.1999999999998
everybody's just moving back to

1214.84 --> 1218.1589999999999
triangulation and assumption of literal

1217.2 --> 1221.44
position and then

1218.159 --> 1223.5200000000002
speculating about it bypassing all these

1221.44 --> 1226.96
things that i just pointed out

1223.52 --> 1229.76
make that impossible

1226.96 --> 1232.4
people are just glancing past it

1229.76 --> 1235.36
everyone everyone in the freaking world

1232.4 --> 1236.3200000000002
i'm not having any feedback like whoa

1235.36 --> 1239.039
our win

1236.32 --> 1239.36
is really on to something no i don't get

1239.039 --> 1244.48
that

1239.36 --> 1244.4799999999998
at all not even from you guys

1244.88 --> 1248.0800000000002
it just i'm not getting feedback from

1247.76 --> 1252.24
you

1248.08 --> 1253.84
guys so you don't seem to understand

1252.24 --> 1257.36
anything i say

1253.84 --> 1260.0
it's getting kind of on my nerves here

1257.36 --> 1260.4799999999998
because this is not a place for you to

1260.0 --> 1263.84
just

1260.48 --> 1266.799
hang around and blabber in my chat

1263.84 --> 1268.1589999999999
and forward some random question when i

1266.799 --> 1270.8799999999999
don't know what i'm talking about now

1268.159 --> 1273.6000000000001
this place is also for you to pay

1270.88 --> 1273.6000000000001
attention

1274.32 --> 1279.52
listen to what i say and try to

1277.36 --> 1280.7199999999998
understand and if you there's something

1279.52 --> 1283.6
preventing you from

1280.72 --> 1284.4
understanding then put that forth on the

1283.6 --> 1287.1999999999998
table

1284.4 --> 1288.24
so i can address it and help you

1287.2 --> 1291.8400000000001
understand

1288.24 --> 1291.84
what i just said

1294.0 --> 1309.12
hey robkin see you

1305.76 --> 1312.64
like not a particle and invisible

1309.12 --> 1315.28
infinitely divisible yeah yeah

1312.64 --> 1316.4
right thank you mark collard i

1315.28 --> 1319.44
appreciate that if

1316.4 --> 1324.159
even though that specifically does not

1319.44 --> 1324.159
directly relate to this subject

1326.24 --> 1329.36
but i appreciate it

1331.36 --> 1337.6
in this case it's not about the physical

1334.4 --> 1339.52
nate yeah the substantial nature of

1337.6 --> 1342.48
light that's a whole different matter

1339.52 --> 1343.52
you know that's that's a difficult one

1342.48 --> 1347.2
it's something else

1343.52 --> 1350.559
now this is about the division between

1347.2 --> 1353.76
physical light and holographic

1350.559 --> 1355.9189999999999
light which in my conception is

1353.76 --> 1357.76
the entire array of lights that come

1355.919 --> 1359.919
from the heavens

1357.76 --> 1361.039
all the celestial lights are holographic

1359.919 --> 1363.5200000000002
in nature

1361.039 --> 1364.48
and there is no proof that they are

1363.52 --> 1367.52
coming from

1364.48 --> 1368.64
physical points in space and have the

1367.52 --> 1371.039
inverse square law

1368.64 --> 1372.96
applied to them there is no proof that

1371.039 --> 1376.8799999999999
that is the case about any of the

1372.96 --> 1376.88
celestial lights including the sun

1384.799 --> 1389.039
right substantial is a good terminology

1386.799 --> 1391.76
in this case because it is about the

1389.039 --> 1394.4
substance it's about

1391.76 --> 1397.12
it's not matter in this sense because it

1394.4 --> 1398.88
doesn't abide to the molecular concept

1397.12 --> 1402.4799999999998
which is really what matters supposed to

1398.88 --> 1405.44
be but a substance

1402.48 --> 1406.48
means it's a real thing in the physical

1405.44 --> 1409.8400000000001
world

1406.48 --> 1410.32
sort of like well it does literally mean

1409.84 --> 1414.24
that

1410.32 --> 1414.24
so yeah substantial in this case

1415.2 --> 1420.64
is indeed a good terminology

1418.24 --> 1422.72
for this

1420.64 --> 1425.279
[Music]

1422.72 --> 1427.919
right yeah holograph thank you joe lyric

1425.279 --> 1430.88
holographic does seem likely

1427.919 --> 1431.6000000000001
well maybe it's tough to pill to swallow

1430.88 --> 1434.5590000000002
but

1431.6 --> 1436.9599999999998
it's like the only remaining option left

1434.559 --> 1439.52
that i could even conceive of

1436.96 --> 1441.919
and i seem to be quite unique in my

1439.52 --> 1444.08
ability to conceive it

1441.919 --> 1445.039
because other people just can't even

1444.08 --> 1447.52
conceive

1445.039 --> 1450.1589999999999
that physicality assumption bias is

1447.52 --> 1452.32
getting in the way

1450.159 --> 1453.6000000000001
it's too tough for people to imagine

1452.32 --> 1456.799
that lights

1453.6 --> 1460.08
can be

1456.799 --> 1463.76
non-local in origin

1460.08 --> 1466.08
it's too difficult to try to

1463.76 --> 1467.039
envision it for the consciousness

1466.08 --> 1469.279
apparently

1467.039 --> 1471.84
too used to just lights coming from

1469.279 --> 1474.4
physical objects

1471.84 --> 1476.48
through heliocentrism that all lights

1474.4 --> 1480.24
indeed come from physical objects

1476.48 --> 1481.679
to not entertain the conception that

1480.24 --> 1485.44
lights may actually

1481.679 --> 1487.8400000000001
come from non-local sources

1485.44 --> 1490.24
it's not considered like that's for the

1487.84 --> 1492.1589999999999
technology and the hologram

1490.24 --> 1494.96
thingies and then blah blah blah you

1492.159 --> 1494.96
know how that goes

1495.919 --> 1500.4
no it's it's just not entertained it's

1498.72 --> 1502.32
it's not addressed

1500.4 --> 1505.2
the situation concerning the heavenly

1502.32 --> 1507.4399999999998
bodies are just not properly addressed

1505.2 --> 1508.32
they're left open and then filled in

1507.44 --> 1511.919
with

1508.32 --> 1511.9189999999999
the astronomy

1512.84 --> 1515.84
stories

1522.08 --> 1526.08
this one is just the same size type

1524.4 --> 1529.039
holiday what

1526.08 --> 1531.1999999999998
same size no but the thing about a

1529.039 --> 1533.6
hologram is they don't have any actual

1531.2 --> 1536.64
size the holograms are apparent things

1533.6 --> 1540.08
so any size the hologram mate

1536.64 --> 1540.88
may show display itself as will be

1540.08 --> 1544.0
apparent

1540.88 --> 1546.0800000000002
to the observer holograms only have

1544.0 --> 1549.52
apparent sizes

1546.08 --> 1552.08
too specific to the

1549.52 --> 1552.08
observer

1552.72 --> 1556.24
they don't have actual sizes because

1554.159 --> 1558.88
they're not actual objects

1556.24 --> 1560.559
in actual locations with actual sizes

1558.88 --> 1563.679
they're just

1560.559 --> 1566.3999999999999
light manifestations that give off an

1563.679 --> 1567.279
appearance of being almost like an

1566.4 --> 1569.44
object

1567.279 --> 1571.039
that the brain with physicality

1569.44 --> 1574.559
assumption bias can mistake

1571.039 --> 1577.039
as a literal physical object

1574.559 --> 1577.9189999999999
it's very easy mistake to make because

1577.039 --> 1581.36
as humans

1577.919 --> 1583.919
we deal and we are trained to deal with

1581.36 --> 1584.7199999999998
physical objects with everything in our

1583.919 --> 1586.5590000000002
lives

1584.72 --> 1588.559
so it's very weird to suddenly just

1586.559 --> 1590.1589999999999
conceive like not a physical object you

1588.559 --> 1593.52
know

1590.159 --> 1595.7600000000002
explaining a freaking rainbow to a kid

1593.52 --> 1597.36
if they're very intelligent can just be

1595.76 --> 1600.559
freaking confusing

1597.36 --> 1602.4799999999998
if they keep on like really wanting to

1600.559 --> 1604.6399999999999
know how that works why

1602.48 --> 1606.4
why does it move with you all the yeah

1604.64 --> 1607.919
it's confusing

1606.4 --> 1610.8400000000001
a lot of parents probably can't even

1607.919 --> 1613.1200000000001
properly explain it

1610.84 --> 1615.039
why what it even is

1613.12 --> 1618.3999999999999
it's just natural well it's actually a

1615.039 --> 1621.52
hologram it's a holographic light effect

1618.4 --> 1623.2
that's natural it happens

1621.52 --> 1625.36
it's a part of the design of the realm

1623.2 --> 1627.919
it naturally manifests

1625.36 --> 1627.9189999999999
probably

1632.96 --> 1640.32
anyway so yeah good show very inspiring

1637.6 --> 1643.4399999999998
i made some notes

1640.32 --> 1643.4399999999998
so that i would remember

1646.88 --> 1654.3200000000002
ah also basically put out a

1651.039 --> 1658.399
an official statement now

1654.32 --> 1659.36
about why terrestrial refraction is a

1658.399 --> 1663.279
paradox

1659.36 --> 1666.24
and i put down a quotation

1663.279 --> 1669.039
of it in the chat for myself to remember

1666.24 --> 1671.6
and for it to be official

1669.039 --> 1673.919
it is my terrestrial refraction paradox

1671.6 --> 1677.1999999999998
definition

1673.919 --> 1680.5590000000002
is that follow it is as follows

1677.2 --> 1683.44
the terrestrial refraction paradox

1680.559 --> 1685.44
if terrestrial refraction like bending

1683.44 --> 1688.88
down around the ball seven over six

1685.44 --> 1691.919
r based exists it could never

1688.88 --> 1693.1200000000001
have been used to establish the radius

1691.919 --> 1695.44
of earth

1693.12 --> 1698.399
which is exactly what would be required

1695.44 --> 1700.3200000000002
if you cannot see the geometric horizon

1698.399 --> 1704.7199999999998
in the location where it is supposed to

1700.32 --> 1704.72
be according to the spherical geometry

1706.08 --> 1709.1999999999998
or win 2020

1709.76 --> 1714.0
so that's the definition that's

1712.559 --> 1716.6399999999999
basically the

1714.0 --> 1718.799
concise explanation as to the

1716.64 --> 1725.8400000000001
terrestrial refraction paradox

1718.799 --> 1725.84
why it is a paradox

1733.039 --> 1738.399
everybody got that i expect you to all

1736.88 --> 1742.48
know it by heart from me

1738.399 --> 1742.4799999999998
just saying in one time of course

1744.96 --> 1747.919
i could say it again

1751.44 --> 1759.2
right the terrestrial refraction paradox

1756.48 --> 1759.6
if terrestrial refraction like bending

1759.2 --> 1762.0800000000002
down

1759.6 --> 1763.1999999999998
around a ball seven over six r based

1762.08 --> 1764.96
exists

1763.2 --> 1767.2
it could never have been used to

1764.96 --> 1770.08
establish the radius of earth

1767.2 --> 1772.72
which is exactly what would be required

1770.08 --> 1774.8799999999999
if you cannot see the geometric horizon

1772.72 --> 1778.799
in the location where it is supposed to

1774.88 --> 1781.8400000000001
be according to spherical geometry

1778.799 --> 1781.84
there we go

1797.44 --> 1809.8400000000001
yeah welcome to flat earth by the way

1815.6 --> 1817.84
hmm

1819.2 --> 1823.8400000000001
did i see nathan oakley in chat earlier

1831.039 --> 1841.76
yeah i did

1836.64 --> 1845.279
spiritual what what is that

1841.76 --> 1847.36
uh no it's just a holographic

1845.279 --> 1849.44
manifestation

1847.36 --> 1852.24
it's energies in the air probably

1849.44 --> 1855.279
electrical nature the same thing that

1852.24 --> 1859.039
causes the statics the electric

1855.279 --> 1861.6
ether if you will not the light

1859.039 --> 1863.84
recoil the medium required for light to

1861.6 --> 1864.7199999999998
be a wave not that either the electrical

1863.84 --> 1866.6399999999999
ether

1864.72 --> 1868.0
used to i think it even was called by

1866.64 --> 1871.8400000000001
that by

1868.0 --> 1874.799
tesla the natural energy electrics

1871.84 --> 1876.0
system on the earth that probably is the

1874.799 --> 1880.6399999999999
cause

1876.0 --> 1883.36
of almost every natural phenomena

1880.64 --> 1884.7990000000002
out there including the tides the the

1883.36 --> 1888.0
magnetic system

1884.799 --> 1891.12
on the earth all kinds of things

1888.0 --> 1894.72
it is probably feeding

1891.12 --> 1897.279
the sun primarily because it the sun

1894.72 --> 1899.3600000000001
manifestation specifically is basically

1897.279 --> 1901.279
outputting the most energy so it will be

1899.36 --> 1905.6789999999999
gathering the most energy

1901.279 --> 1910.0
in order for that cycle to be like that

1905.679 --> 1910.88
right and it's fascinating because then

1910.0 --> 1913.919
i suddenly

1910.88 --> 1916.48
started to remember even pj's story

1913.919 --> 1917.3600000000001
about that giant tree that was cut down

1916.48 --> 1920.559
and then

1917.36 --> 1921.6
heavenly bodies came from that and blah

1920.559 --> 1924.0
blah blah right

1921.6 --> 1926.1589999999999
a long time ago and i supported that

1924.0 --> 1930.88
story it reminded me of something

1926.159 --> 1933.519
now i suddenly put my model conception

1930.88 --> 1935.1200000000001
next to that concept and came to

1933.519 --> 1938.3990000000001
something

1935.12 --> 1941.6789999999999
fascinating like a designer's effect

1938.399 --> 1945.36
and that is if there would be a giant

1941.679 --> 1948.96
tower like a babylonian giant antenna

1945.36 --> 1949.9189999999999
like really giant as big as the entire

1948.96 --> 1952.3990000000001
netherlands

1949.919 --> 1954.48
and just reaching up for i don't know as

1952.399 --> 1956.6399999999999
far as it could go

1954.48 --> 1958.32
as far as there's room they just build

1956.64 --> 1961.44
that thing that tap in like

1958.32 --> 1963.279
all the energy right all the energy

1961.44 --> 1964.72
that is up there which is what would

1963.279 --> 1967.679
happen

1964.72 --> 1969.44
that that's like bob from glow busters

1967.679 --> 1972.48
even explained that

1969.44 --> 1975.6000000000001
that's the same reason why a wire

1972.48 --> 1978.88
on a set loon tap it lit

1975.6 --> 1982.32
just having that wire it's like a long

1978.88 --> 1984.3990000000001
catching air but instead the wire

1982.32 --> 1986.399
catches the natural electricity in the

1984.399 --> 1988.6399999999999
air it's very similar

1986.399 --> 1990.6399999999999
right if you have a giant tower in

1988.64 --> 1991.519
antenna babylonian tower what it would

1990.64 --> 1994.3990000000001
do

1991.519 --> 1995.36
is it would tap all that energy i don't

1994.399 --> 1998.6399999999999
know what it would do

1995.36 --> 2000.08
it would if it could be used yeah

1998.64 --> 2001.8400000000001
i don't know what the consequences of

2000.08 --> 2003.12
tapping all that energy for the physical

2001.84 --> 2005.6
structure would be and

2003.12 --> 2006.799
what you could even do with that just if

2005.6 --> 2009.76
it would all be tapped

2006.799 --> 2010.8799999999999
that would probably cause the heavens to

2009.76 --> 2014.0
dim down

2010.88 --> 2016.48
or even completely extinguished as long

2014.0 --> 2017.12
as that amount of energy is being tapped

2016.48 --> 2020.3990000000001
into

2017.12 --> 2023.4399999999998
atmospheric energy

2020.399 --> 2026.32
right and the same goes if there was

2023.44 --> 2027.8400000000001
a giant tree that would reach until the

2026.32 --> 2030.08
top

2027.84 --> 2031.6789999999999
it would literally cause the heavenly

2030.08 --> 2035.039
lights to go away

2031.679 --> 2035.72
and perhaps that energy by a giant tree

2035.039 --> 2038.72
would be

2035.72 --> 2040.799
reused in an organic fashion that would

2038.72 --> 2043.6000000000001
cause its own type of weird light

2040.799 --> 2047.9189999999999
effect that would replace the the

2043.6 --> 2050.24
heavenly bodies they're light

2047.919 --> 2051.2000000000003
it's so weird when i thought about it

2050.24 --> 2053.2
like whoa

2051.2 --> 2054.6389999999997
suddenly i'm connecting this these

2053.2 --> 2058.399
mythical origin

2054.639 --> 2060.079
ideas with my conception

2058.399 --> 2062.0789999999997
of the heavenly bodies and it kind of

2060.079 --> 2064.159
works out

2062.079 --> 2065.119
like yeah if you would build a tower of

2064.159 --> 2069.28
babylon

2065.119 --> 2072.159
at some point the heavens might fall

2069.28 --> 2074.48
like might go away and who knows what

2072.159 --> 2077.679
else would happen

2074.48 --> 2082.0
it would be pretty dramatic so

2077.679 --> 2082.0
that was just fascinating to realize

2086.839 --> 2089.839
that

2098.8 --> 2106.5600000000004
all right

2103.359 --> 2109.68
what is also kind of fascinating is that

2106.56 --> 2110.72
depending on how strong the electric

2109.68 --> 2113.52
ether is

2110.72 --> 2115.7599999999998
and how much it increases over height

2113.52 --> 2118.8
it's weird to think that

2115.76 --> 2122.0
giants if they have

2118.8 --> 2122.2400000000002
the ability to basically use it like on

2122.0 --> 2126.0
an

2122.24 --> 2129.1189999999997
organic level they too might

2126.0 --> 2130.0
actually utilize that power and the

2129.119 --> 2132.8
bigger they get

2130.0 --> 2133.599
the more electrical power they would be

2132.8 --> 2136.7200000000003
receiving

2133.599 --> 2138.2400000000002
by their sheer height like titan size if

2136.72 --> 2141.359
they were like a

2138.24 --> 2145.839
a kilometer high they're surely going to

2141.359 --> 2145.839
be tapping into that electrical energy

2145.92 --> 2151.359
it's fascinating to think about that and

2148.16 --> 2154.24
it even makes sense with my atlantean

2151.359 --> 2156.0789999999997
conception pyramids creating electrical

2154.24 --> 2159.839
fields through hydroelectrics

2156.079 --> 2163.52
through the rock and smaller giants

2159.839 --> 2166.88
feeding off that they might be too small

2163.52 --> 2171.68
to tap to yeah to really get that energy

2166.88 --> 2176.4
from high above so a pyramid would then

2171.68 --> 2180.0
cause more electrical energy in locally

2176.4 --> 2180.0
it totally fits

2182.88 --> 2187.839
yeah i got some inspiration from that

2198.0 --> 2202.24
i don't know what you're talking about

2199.28 --> 2202.2400000000002
anthony dickinson

2207.359 --> 2211.119
technically we don't even know what the

2208.8 --> 2212.6400000000003
firmament is all we know is there has to

2211.119 --> 2215.119
be a container

2212.64 --> 2216.8799999999997
has to be a limited amount of volume how

2215.119 --> 2220.88
that limited amount of volume

2216.88 --> 2224.56
is maintained

2220.88 --> 2229.6800000000003
is unclear we have no

2224.56 --> 2232.4
proof what yesterday i

2229.68 --> 2233.839
gave you like a vision a dream image

2232.4 --> 2236.88
moment

2233.839 --> 2240.48
to kind of

2236.88 --> 2243.76
envision why we can't see it like

2240.48 --> 2246.4
it would almost be in that

2243.76 --> 2247.2000000000003
in that conception like if we went to

2246.4 --> 2249.92
the arctic

2247.2 --> 2251.1189999999997
went through it and then actually found

2249.92 --> 2253.359
the barrier

2251.119 --> 2254.88
well yeah in my conception it's very

2253.359 --> 2258.0789999999997
likely that it's going to be

2254.88 --> 2258.079
like a holographic

2258.16 --> 2262.7999999999997
screen that's just showing the heavenly

2261.839 --> 2266.56
bodies in their

2262.8 --> 2269.04
angular positions specifically

2266.56 --> 2271.04
but nothing else like that's the only

2269.04 --> 2272.72
thing you will see holographically

2271.04 --> 2274.4
through it

2272.72 --> 2275.9199999999996
but you can't literally go through it

2274.4 --> 2278.4
and it's still not going to have literal

2275.92 --> 2281.52
positions that's kind of like

2278.4 --> 2282.64
how i conceived it and it would be blue

2281.52 --> 2285.119
during the day

2282.64 --> 2285.839
and it would be black during the night

2285.119 --> 2288.32
it would all

2285.839 --> 2291.359
be subjected to the daylight nighttime

2288.32 --> 2291.3590000000004
changes and all that

2292.72 --> 2299.839
but there would be nothing else visible

2296.24 --> 2301.5989999999997
on it through it

2299.839 --> 2303.359
and the heavenly bodies would not

2301.599 --> 2306.1600000000003
literally be beyond it

2303.359 --> 2306.72
they would still be just as holographic

2306.16 --> 2313.839
as they

2306.72 --> 2313.839
are right in the middle of the realm

2318.24 --> 2323.52
so it's not a mirror there's no mirror

2320.56 --> 2326.56
effect going on it's not glass

2323.52 --> 2330.48
there's no visible

2326.56 --> 2332.64
sign of it it's just a barrier

2330.48 --> 2334.32
that has an extra dimensional

2332.64 --> 2337.5989999999997
holographic

2334.32 --> 2341.2000000000003
trait to it it's like open

2337.599 --> 2345.3590000000004
for the holographic bodies it it

2341.2 --> 2347.2
it still allows them to be seen

2345.359 --> 2348.4
apparently beyond even though there is

2347.2 --> 2349.7599999999998
no beyond

2348.4 --> 2352.839
pretty sure that beyond the barrier

2349.76 --> 2354.48
there is nothing there's not going to be

2352.839 --> 2356.64
more

2354.48 --> 2358.88
more land or anything if there's a berry

2356.64 --> 2360.3199999999997
there will be nothing beyond

2358.88 --> 2362.079
if it's a physical barrier now if

2360.32 --> 2364.4
there's an energy barrier somewhere

2362.079 --> 2366.1600000000003
that's another matter

2364.4 --> 2369.359
then there might be little there would

2366.16 --> 2372.0
have to be more land beyond

2369.359 --> 2373.359
but any physical barrier there's very

2372.0 --> 2375.44
unlikely that

2373.359 --> 2383.839
there's going to be more physical space

2375.44 --> 2383.839
beyond that

2408.839 --> 2416.72
so

2410.079 --> 2416.7200000000003
heavy water but is heavy water invisible

2418.48 --> 2425.359
does heavy water contain

2421.599 --> 2428.6400000000003
holographic elements because

2425.359 --> 2430.7999999999997
if it was any physical material

2428.64 --> 2432.64
that would correlate to anything we know

2430.8 --> 2437.3590000000004
here

2432.64 --> 2441.52
we would see it we would see

2437.359 --> 2444.7999999999997
physical traits reflections absorption

2441.52 --> 2446.88
anything we would see it we would see

2444.8 --> 2449.52
the barrier in some way

2446.88 --> 2449.52
and we don't

2451.28 --> 2458.5600000000004
at no point can you distinguish

2455.119 --> 2461.359
a specific location of the barrier

2458.56 --> 2461.359
do you see that

2462.8 --> 2467.76
so it can't be any normal physical

2465.76 --> 2469.119
substance it's just impossible because

2467.76 --> 2474.1600000000003
any normal physical

2469.119 --> 2481.839
substance has visible traits

2474.16 --> 2481.839
it always will

2485.92 --> 2491.76
is a rainbow a reflection no

2489.04 --> 2492.8
not really it's a hologram it's a

2491.76 --> 2495.76
holographic

2492.8 --> 2498.1600000000003
reflection you could say like one

2495.76 --> 2501.44
holographic type of light source

2498.16 --> 2504.48
that is being bent refracted through

2501.44 --> 2506.64
through water in yeah

2504.48 --> 2507.52
and split up you know the prismatic

2506.64 --> 2510.319
effect

2507.52 --> 2511.7599999999998
and then you see the rainbow so it's

2510.319 --> 2514.319
like a holographic

2511.76 --> 2516.2400000000002
it's a holographic reflection it's a

2514.319 --> 2519.839
reflection of a holographic

2516.24 --> 2524.9599999999996
effect that's natural and that's

2519.839 --> 2528.4
then yeah reflect into the hologram

2524.96 --> 2528.4
the rainbows don't prove a dome

2531.68 --> 2540.72
they don't

2537.68 --> 2542.72
a rainbow is technically a circle

2540.72 --> 2544.56
right and it is it's not like the

2542.72 --> 2545.4399999999996
heavenly bodies you can't see them

2544.56 --> 2548.64
underneath you

2545.44 --> 2550.56
ever under any circumstances no

2548.64 --> 2552.96
if you are high up enough and you see a

2550.56 --> 2557.92
rainbow there's a big chance it will go

2552.96 --> 2560.64
full circle full circle right

2557.92 --> 2561.52
that's because it's like a reflection of

2560.64 --> 2564.8799999999997
the sun

2561.52 --> 2569.52
hologram being split up

2564.88 --> 2573.359
on the edges and it's a prismatic effect

2569.52 --> 2575.04
so it's not some kind of reflection of

2573.359 --> 2578.0
the dome

2575.04 --> 2580.64
it's a refraction of the sunlight

2578.0 --> 2580.64
hologram

2580.72 --> 2593.839
not a proof of a dome

2596.54 --> 2601.439
[Music]

2610.079 --> 2614.319
right well more colored you're right

2614.8 --> 2618.6400000000003
when self-proclaimed smart people are

2616.64 --> 2620.7999999999997
unable to entertain alternative

2618.64 --> 2622.8799999999997
conceptions yeah that's right

2620.8 --> 2625.44
but that's usually because those people

2622.88 --> 2626.6400000000003
are weaponizing their smart for social

2625.44 --> 2628.96
reasons

2626.64 --> 2630.48
so they're not smart out of pure

2628.96 --> 2632.88
curiosity

2630.48 --> 2634.48
and collecting true information now

2632.88 --> 2635.28
they're instead utilizing their

2634.48 --> 2639.2
intellect to

2635.28 --> 2641.8390000000004
seem smart and to gain social authority

2639.2 --> 2642.7999999999997
through those smarts and that's a

2641.839 --> 2645.92
different type

2642.8 --> 2649.8390000000004
of smart it's a different type of

2645.92 --> 2649.839
application of it

2665.92 --> 2670.64
okay anthony dickinson's if you say so

2672.24 --> 2677.839
i don't see how

2678.88 --> 2684.2400000000002
i don't see how how that

2682.079 --> 2685.6800000000003
it's proof of that like if if that was

2684.24 --> 2688.24
said in the bible like oh

2685.68 --> 2691.1189999999997
rainbows that means that god's not gonna

2688.24 --> 2693.4399999999996
do a flood anymore okay

2691.119 --> 2695.119
if that's what's in the book i don't

2693.44 --> 2698.0
know

2695.119 --> 2700.319
but yeah that cannot be translated into

2698.0 --> 2705.359
actual physical logic though

2700.319 --> 2706.88
just so you know

2705.359 --> 2708.88
because i'm pretty sure rainbows have

2706.88 --> 2709.359
always existed as long as there was

2708.88 --> 2712.0
water

2709.359 --> 2712.48
hey if there was no water none at all

2712.0 --> 2714.48
and

2712.48 --> 2716.72
yeah there would be no water if it was

2714.48 --> 2718.96
all just like a desert planet yeah

2716.72 --> 2720.3999999999996
on the desert planet so that what am i

2718.96 --> 2722.16
saying it's like dune

2720.4 --> 2723.52
if everything was just purely dry there

2722.16 --> 2725.839
was barely any water yeah

2723.52 --> 2727.04
rainbows would be extremely rare because

2725.839 --> 2729.92
rainbows only occur

2727.04 --> 2731.7599999999998
when water is common and there's a lot

2729.92 --> 2734.56
rain

2731.76 --> 2735.5200000000004
to have yeah water droplets refracting

2734.56 --> 2737.599
the sun

2735.52 --> 2739.04
causing the rainbow so if there's not a

2737.599 --> 2740.7200000000003
lot of rain and everything around yeah

2739.04 --> 2742.88
there's rarely going to be a rainbow

2740.72 --> 2747.839
if that's what it's kind of referring to

2742.88 --> 2747.839
indirectly okay i can go with that

2749.04 --> 2752.72
i think i i just connected it

2753.359 --> 2757.52
but that is only based on the

2755.359 --> 2760.24
pre-assumption that before the flood

2757.52 --> 2762.4
there was barely any water then

2760.24 --> 2765.1189999999997
it would make sense there was plenty of

2762.4 --> 2775.839
water around that makes no damn sense

2765.119 --> 2775.839
just saying

2807.92 --> 2813.119
there was nothing but water the first

2810.16 --> 2813.1189999999997
day of creation

2814.0 --> 2820.24
well it's complicated you know that was

2817.2 --> 2820.24
the face of the deep

2820.96 --> 2824.0
so where is that

2824.72 --> 2828.48
i'm not sure it it's not clear like

2827.52 --> 2830.48
there is water

2828.48 --> 2832.2400000000002
definitely there is water and water

2830.48 --> 2837.2
splitting water from the water all that

2832.24 --> 2837.2
yeah yeah it's interesting however

2837.52 --> 2842.72
there's was it said that it would create

2841.52 --> 2845.92
oceans

2842.72 --> 2848.5589999999997
for example i can imagine rivers if you

2845.92 --> 2853.839
want life to exist

2848.559 --> 2853.8390000000004
plants and all that i don't know

2857.68 --> 2863.52
the flood was the first rain holy really

2861.28 --> 2865.28
where has been that been said because

2863.52 --> 2870.16
that would definitely back up

2865.28 --> 2870.1600000000003
what i just presupposed

2870.839 --> 2873.839
basically

2898.839 --> 2914.5589999999997
hmm

2900.64 --> 2917.68
yeah just thinking

2914.559 --> 2920.2400000000002
yeah what if there was water

2917.68 --> 2922.44
but there simply were not the typical

2920.24 --> 2925.68
weather conditions maybe that's like an

2922.44 --> 2926.48
electromagnetic change that eventually

2925.68 --> 2929.44
caused

2926.48 --> 2930.079
things like storms maybe before that all

2929.44 --> 2933.28
the moist

2930.079 --> 2937.119
would simply be hanging in gaseous form

2933.28 --> 2939.6800000000003
in the air and perhaps liquefied

2937.119 --> 2943.359
in ponds and all that but maybe there

2939.68 --> 2946.5589999999997
was no storm no rain because

2943.359 --> 2949.04
the terrestrial mechanism the

2946.559 --> 2950.8
electrical mechanism that causes that

2949.04 --> 2952.5589999999997
part specifically to work the way it

2950.8 --> 2954.96
does maybe it wasn't there

2952.559 --> 2956.6400000000003
yet that would make sense that there

2954.96 --> 2959.28
would be no rainbows but there would

2956.64 --> 2962.0789999999997
still be water and life around

2959.28 --> 2963.76
because if it's never going to rain then

2962.079 --> 2965.52
there's probably never going to be any

2963.76 --> 2967.8390000000004
rainbows

2965.52 --> 2969.68
but there would still have to be water

2967.839 --> 2971.7599999999998
in order to sustain life

2969.68 --> 2973.52
so it could still just be dissolved in

2971.76 --> 2976.1600000000003
the air maybe re-liquefy

2973.52 --> 2978.319
some way and there would be ponds but

2976.16 --> 2985.839
there would be no rain

2978.319 --> 2985.839
that could kind of explain that

3001.68 --> 3005.1189999999997
i could do yeah that makes sense

3008.24 --> 3011.359
it's kind of funny though because i

3010.0 --> 3013.44
don't know if you've ever

3011.359 --> 3015.839
carefully watched do especially in the

3013.44 --> 3018.96
morning early early morning when the sun

3015.839 --> 3018.96
is pretty horizontal

3019.92 --> 3024.88
you can see almost like rainbow colors

3022.24 --> 3027.5989999999997
like in the water droplets

3024.88 --> 3028.079
you know if you ever seen like a grass

3027.599 --> 3031.28
field

3028.079 --> 3032.4
covered in dew or plants especially if

3031.28 --> 3036.4
it's just very fresh

3032.4 --> 3036.88
very fresh still it's almost like you're

3036.4 --> 3038.96
looking

3036.88 --> 3041.04
like it's all slightly oil covered or

3038.96 --> 3043.599
something because there will be like

3041.04 --> 3045.7599999999998
the holographic rainbow type effect

3043.599 --> 3048.8
coming through the droplets

3045.76 --> 3050.1600000000003
so you do seem see some sort of rainbow

3048.8 --> 3052.6400000000003
effect

3050.16 --> 3053.5989999999997
you just don't see it holographically

3052.64 --> 3055.52
mid-air

3053.599 --> 3057.3590000000004
because it's not in the air it's on the

3055.52 --> 3069.839
ground on the plants that's where it

3057.359 --> 3069.839
gathered that's where it collected

3074.24 --> 3077.839
all right oh yeah mark color did you

3076.079 --> 3081.119
hear my concept about it

3077.839 --> 3083.68
my theory about the languages tower of

3081.119 --> 3086.2400000000002
babel

3083.68 --> 3088.7999999999997
because i think what probably happened

3086.24 --> 3092.5589999999997
is that everybody before that time

3088.8 --> 3092.559
was telepathic

3093.76 --> 3099.3590000000004
so you would if you can just

3097.44 --> 3101.44
communicate telepathically and it's

3099.359 --> 3106.24
normal

3101.44 --> 3108.48
then there is no need to learn languages

3106.24 --> 3110.4799999999996
because you don't have to communicate

3108.48 --> 3113.119
interpret you can just directly

3110.48 --> 3116.88
communicate spirit to spirit as it were

3113.119 --> 3119.359
or if suddenly that telepathy would be

3116.88 --> 3120.8
halted who knows maybe by tapping into

3119.359 --> 3122.96
the electric ether

3120.8 --> 3124.7200000000003
and all that building too high maybe

3122.96 --> 3126.88
that distorted the

3124.72 --> 3129.359
electrical situation causing the

3126.88 --> 3132.0
telepathy to just drop away and suddenly

3129.359 --> 3133.2799999999997
everybody could not communicate anymore

3132.0 --> 3135.44
they'd have to basically

3133.28 --> 3137.0400000000004
learn everything from scratch how to

3135.44 --> 3138.96
communicate and different

3137.04 --> 3141.04
conclusions different language

3138.96 --> 3144.96
approaches all that

3141.04 --> 3144.96
that makes actual sense to me

3147.52 --> 3152.0
see how funny it all ties in it's all

3150.24 --> 3155.04
about the electrics it's all about

3152.0 --> 3157.68
it atmospheric electrics everything is

3155.04 --> 3158.5589999999997
seems to be determined by the

3157.68 --> 3162.48
atmospheric

3158.559 --> 3165.119
electrical situation every time

3162.48 --> 3167.119
and when god seems to dramatically alter

3165.119 --> 3168.96
situations

3167.119 --> 3170.2400000000002
it seems like it always has to do with

3168.96 --> 3172.16
the electric ether

3170.24 --> 3181.839
as they call it the atmospheric

3172.16 --> 3181.839
electrics somehow

3202.4 --> 3206.96
language of creation well wouldn't

3204.64 --> 3223.839
telepathy be the language of creation

3206.96 --> 3223.839
i'm pretty sure that god is telepathic

3234.4 --> 3238.1600000000003
okay anthony dickinson

3238.48 --> 3242.0
you mean watch a premiere of a recorded

3241.359 --> 3244.64
thing

3242.0 --> 3247.52
or are you actually saying invite me on

3244.64 --> 3247.52
a live panel

3248.64 --> 3251.839
i don't know if he even does that

3273.839 --> 3276.7999999999997
know it live

3277.599 --> 3281.6800000000003
but are you asking are you inviting on

3279.76 --> 3284.96
the panel or are you just advertising

3281.68 --> 3284.96
for upskiva right now

3290.839 --> 3307.839
okay

3293.119 --> 3307.839
maybe i feel like it

3319.119 --> 3325.119
oh thank you for the 99 cent super chat

3321.2 --> 3325.1189999999997
donation good servant much appreciated

3328.24 --> 3333.04
and to everybody else little pluck for

3331.2 --> 3335.2799999999997
myself i think it's a pretty damn good

3333.04 --> 3338.5589999999997
show so far with huge amounts of

3335.28 --> 3341.92
click crystal clearly presented data

3338.559 --> 3343.3590000000004
on academic levels if you got anything

3341.92 --> 3347.119
to help me out

3343.359 --> 3350.16
through paypal please donate i mean it

3347.119 --> 3352.079
i have a giant chunk of debt that i have

3350.16 --> 3354.0
to even pay back

3352.079 --> 3356.4
and i'm not even through it i'd still

3354.0 --> 3358.96
need to go on for five more days

3356.4 --> 3360.48
and i literally have 15 euros on my bank

3358.96 --> 3365.2
account

3360.48 --> 3365.2
it's not gonna get me through it

3366.16 --> 3373.2799999999997
please support me and my channel

3370.48 --> 3375.52
now i've already gotten quite some

3373.28 --> 3379.2000000000003
support but i just really need

3375.52 --> 3382.24
extra i know it's annoying

3379.2 --> 3382.24
but i really need it

3388.839 --> 3391.839
right

3392.72 --> 3396.0
because the way it's looking now i'm

3394.319 --> 3398.2799999999997
gonna have to borrow even more money and

3396.0 --> 3403.52
then i'm gonna have to pay what is it

3398.28 --> 3406.96
150 or 200 euros back

3403.52 --> 3410.72
and then i got another bill of 75 euros

3406.96 --> 3414.799
and i got to pay back another 200

3410.72 --> 3415.9199999999996
yeah to my uh yeah my health insurance

3414.799 --> 3418.079
even though they

3415.92 --> 3419.6800000000003
yeah that's just automated most of it so

3418.079 --> 3421.2000000000003
they don't really care i can postpone

3419.68 --> 3424.3999999999996
that for over two months

3421.2 --> 3425.2
three months maybe right i need your

3424.4 --> 3432.4100000000003
freaking help

3425.2 --> 3434.0789999999997
i mean it please guys

3432.41 --> 3436.319
[Music]

3434.079 --> 3436.319
all right

3437.2 --> 3442.0
i'm worth it right

3438.82 --> 3447.839
[Music]

3442.0 --> 3447.839
i hope i am

3462.559 --> 3476.079
i know good servant

3474.079 --> 3477.52
but yeah there's 32 people watching i

3476.079 --> 3480.559
know there's a lot of people

3477.52 --> 3480.559
watching in general

3480.72 --> 3486.48
more than the viewers even show usually

3483.76 --> 3487.119
and i'm putting down some really concise

3486.48 --> 3490.079
clear

3487.119 --> 3490.799
data here that branches into so many

3490.079 --> 3494.559
things

3490.799 --> 3497.599
this might be my best episode

3494.559 --> 3499.92
technically in a technical sense

3497.599 --> 3501.599
not most revealing perhaps but

3499.92 --> 3503.839
technically

3501.599 --> 3506.799
it's almost like real big puzzle pieces

3503.839 --> 3508.5589999999997
are coming together

3506.799 --> 3510.4
i didn't even expect that it was going

3508.559 --> 3513.599
to be this good and fluid

3510.4 --> 3518.1600000000003
but it is but i definitely

3551.359 --> 3554.96
can just say that with full confidence

but yeah i have but i need support it's

3557.839 --> 3563.2

3971.039 --> 3976.7200000000003

3973.44 --> 3979.359
not live and you're not in chat

3976.72 --> 3980.3999999999996
if you really like what i've been doing

3979.359 --> 3982.319
please

3980.4 --> 3984.1600000000003
even if you don't watch it live please

3982.319 --> 3985.92
do consider donating

3984.16 --> 3987.52
to my paypal the link is in the

3985.92 --> 3988.4
description box below it's kind of

3987.52 --> 3993.839
urgent

3988.4 --> 3993.839
so please support me anyway moving on

3996.559 --> 4001.76
right so yeah

4002.079 --> 4006.2400000000002
what was i talking about oh yeah the

4003.839 --> 4010.24
electric ether how

4006.24 --> 4012.319
a giant spire would distort

4010.24 --> 4015.1189999999997
the electrical setting and causing

4012.319 --> 4017.7599999999998
potentially all kinds of side effects

4015.119 --> 4018.799
because and that's only logical because

4017.76 --> 4022.2400000000002
i think that

4018.799 --> 4022.72
a lot of the activities as human beings

4022.24 --> 4025.52
even

4022.72 --> 4027.9199999999996
and all lifo animal and plant life what

4025.52 --> 4030.48
we typically do

4027.92 --> 4032.4
in our spirit's energy because there is

4030.48 --> 4034.799
just this palpable energy that can be

4032.4 --> 4036.88
missing can be recollected

4034.799 --> 4038.24
has to do with the consciousness too

4036.88 --> 4040.2400000000002
there's this energy

4038.24 --> 4041.839
i think that this energy is technically

4040.24 --> 4044.16
electrical nature

4041.839 --> 4047.2
so yeah if you're literally going to

4044.16 --> 4050.799
alter the electric

4047.2 --> 4053.2799999999997
fluidness around you

4050.799 --> 4055.28
that's could that can potentially have

4053.28 --> 4058.3190000000004
an influence on your

4055.28 --> 4060.4
physiological state on a cellular level

4058.319 --> 4064.5589999999997
and even on a conscious

4060.4 --> 4068.0
spiritual level it's

4064.559 --> 4069.92
really not that hard to imagine

4068.0 --> 4077.359
just say it like that it's not hard to

4069.92 --> 4080.48
imagine for me

4077.359 --> 4084.0789999999997
i know good servant please please

4080.48 --> 4087.039
don't don't get all

4084.079 --> 4087.8390000000004
pushed back and forth by me doing it's

4087.039 --> 4089.8390000000004
not directed

4087.839 --> 4091.2
it's not for you good servant i know

4089.839 --> 4094.0789999999997
you're already giving

4091.2 --> 4095.359
everything you can and you you're like

4094.079 --> 4097.359
zealously

4095.359 --> 4098.96
you're a zealous supporter and follower

4097.359 --> 4102.4800000000005
okay please

4098.96 --> 4104.96
don't make it embarrassing for me

4102.48 --> 4105.919999999999
you don't need to give your last penny

4104.96 --> 4109.12
off your back

4105.92 --> 4109.12
you would also have kids

4109.839 --> 4119.839
your moral support is good

4113.04 --> 4119.839
thank you very much

4125.359 --> 4132.400000000001
first fall feast okay anthony dixon

4128.799 --> 4136.0
i didn't know that

4132.4 --> 4138.3189999999995
and there's a lot of like the uh

4136.0 --> 4138.319
of the

4141.12 --> 4147.839
what's it called

4150.64 --> 4155.1990000000005
ah the old testament that yeah there's a

4153.759 --> 4159.6
lot of torrent

4155.199 --> 4162.639999999999
things that i'm not very familiar with

4159.6 --> 4165.52
and i am not a tauren

4162.64 --> 4165.52
i don't do that

4166.64 --> 4173.759
i'm a christian i literally

4170.239 --> 4177.12
only look at the messages

4173.759 --> 4177.839
acts and essence very important the

4177.12 --> 4180.64
essence

4177.839 --> 4181.679
of christ and what what that is the

4180.64 --> 4185.4400000000005
frequency

4181.679 --> 4187.759
that is if not anything

4185.44 --> 4188.5599999999995
my only focus because i'm not an

4187.759 --> 4192.0
exeterist

4188.56 --> 4195.360000000001
i'm an esoterist and christ

4192.0 --> 4199.199
is what i focus on that frequency

4195.36 --> 4199.199
because i think that the bible has been

4200.84 --> 4206.400000000001
altered in ways that are just difficult

4203.679 --> 4208.4800000000005
to understand because

4206.4 --> 4209.92
because it has been altered we cannot

4208.48 --> 4211.919999999999
conceive

4209.92 --> 4213.6
what it was before it was altered

4211.92 --> 4215.4400000000005
because so many things are introduced

4213.6 --> 4217.4400000000005
that we just take for granted with our

4215.44 --> 4220.639999999999
entire mindset

4217.44 --> 4222.08
so we can't even see what has been

4220.64 --> 4224.64
before

4222.08 --> 4226.719
now that's effective pre-programmed mind

4224.64 --> 4227.679
control and i'm pretty sure the jesuits

4226.719 --> 4230.56
did that

4227.679 --> 4231.12
very early on with every freaking

4230.56 --> 4234.4800000000005
written

4231.12 --> 4234.48
religion in the world

4234.64 --> 4238.64
including christianity but they could

4237.76 --> 4241.6
not get

4238.64 --> 4242.08
the essence of jesus christ out of it

4241.6 --> 4246.400000000001
they ca

4242.08 --> 4249.679
they couldn't alter it because then it

4246.4 --> 4251.839999999999
it wouldn't work so they have to keep it

4249.679 --> 4252.4800000000005
complete enough in order for the

4251.84 --> 4255.4400000000005
frequency

4252.48 --> 4255.44
energy to work

4255.84 --> 4259.4400000000005
otherwise it's gonna lose its appeal

4258.08 --> 4261.92
it's gonna lose

4259.44 --> 4263.919999999999
the the gem that makes it all worth it

4261.92 --> 4266.32
see

4263.92 --> 4269.76
for the people outside that want to

4266.32 --> 4269.759999999999
become a part of the religion

4270.4 --> 4276.799999999999
if a religion has nothing real to offer

4274.0 --> 4277.76
and only control then people don't want

4276.8 --> 4280.0
to be part of it

4277.76 --> 4281.04
unless they're like forced and slaved

4280.0 --> 4284.08
into it

4281.04 --> 4286.48
that's cool that's like a

4284.08 --> 4289.28
yeah that's like a hostile cult oh

4286.48 --> 4289.28
that's yeah

4291.28 --> 4295.28
christianity is not a hostile cult as

4293.679 --> 4297.6
far as i know

4295.28 --> 4301.84
nobody can be forced to do that although

4297.6 --> 4301.84
it has happened in the past

4303.28 --> 4307.199
convert or die right

4307.36 --> 4311.5199999999995
i'm pretty sure that christ would never

4310.0 --> 4315.84
ever approve of

4311.52 --> 4315.84
comfort or die ever

4319.6 --> 4324.719
because you can't that's that con you

4322.239 --> 4327.599999999999
can't be forced to convert

4324.719 --> 4329.199
because that is enslavement it has to

4327.6 --> 4332.64
come natural you have to

4329.199 --> 4336.719
get it you have to see it feel it

4332.64 --> 4339.1990000000005
and want it want to move your spirit

4336.719 --> 4341.679
your frequency towards it if you don't

4339.199 --> 4343.04
do that naturally then you're not

4341.679 --> 4345.4400000000005
converted you're just

4343.04 --> 4348.8
forced into calling yourself christian

4345.44 --> 4352.08
and following certain routines

4348.8 --> 4356.0
right that's not proper

4352.08 --> 4359.36
christ would never approve of that

4356.0 --> 4364.0
the only way is to be touched

4359.36 --> 4364.0
and then it has to be an individual

4368.84 --> 4371.84
decision

4373.6 --> 4377.679
okay anthony dickinson that's an

4375.199 --> 4381.199
interesting proposal

4377.679 --> 4384.56
i'm not expert enough on the details

4381.199 --> 4387.599999999999
to confirm or deny that

4384.56 --> 4388.320000000001
but i can't say on an esoteric level in

4387.6 --> 4390.320000000001
the past

4388.32 --> 4392.4
i used to agree with that on a

4390.32 --> 4395.5199999999995
superficial level

4392.4 --> 4399.839999999999
but yeah

4395.52 --> 4399.84
on a superficial level so

4401.44 --> 4405.04
jehovah's witnesses yeah jehovah's

4403.679 --> 4407.12
witnesses are pretty

4405.04 --> 4408.64
but they are like a might they are very

4407.12 --> 4413.04
mind controlling

4408.64 --> 4415.4400000000005
they literally i guess mentally torture

4413.04 --> 4418.239
people to extinguish

4415.44 --> 4422.0
their natural curiosity and just fall

4418.239 --> 4422.0
back to basic programming not

4422.239 --> 4426.08
not start building understanding that's

4425.04 --> 4429.04
what they do

4426.08 --> 4430.8
it's very bad i call them a cult it's

4429.04 --> 4433.5199999999995
not even a religion to be they're really

4430.8 --> 4433.52
just a cult

4433.6 --> 4438.96
they have nothing to do with yeah

4436.88 --> 4441.84
christian enlightenment

4438.96 --> 4441.84
nothing at all

4443.92 --> 4450.8
it's just a programmed system

4447.28 --> 4455.84
and it degenerates the consciousness

4450.8 --> 4455.84
it does

4461.12 --> 4464.32
not that you can't get out of it but

4462.88 --> 4465.1990000000005
yeah if you don't want to degenerate

4464.32 --> 4467.679
mentally

4465.199 --> 4470.96
then you must get out of it or you will

4467.679 --> 4473.04
and then you eventually stay like that

4470.96 --> 4475.84
you will never find understanding for

4473.04 --> 4479.44
those that will not do the same

4475.84 --> 4479.4400000000005
that's what happens when you stay with

4480.84 --> 4483.84
that

4492.32 --> 4496.0
oh anthony dickinson's it's all really

4494.84 --> 4498.2390000000005
nice

4496.0 --> 4498.239
but

4499.12 --> 4503.04
you could just say it another way we

4501.679 --> 4506.4
just have to do good

4503.04 --> 4508.88
we have to be effective you have to

4506.4 --> 4510.239
protect and support your direct

4508.88 --> 4513.92
surroundings it's

4510.239 --> 4516.879999999999
all natural these are all natural

4513.92 --> 4519.1990000000005
spiritual ways to do things it's all

4516.88 --> 4521.12
purely logic based

4519.199 --> 4522.239
and yeah you can turn that in all kinds

4521.12 --> 4524.48
of exoteric

4522.239 --> 4526.48
frameworks by making it super specific

4524.48 --> 4527.36
like now if we say it exactly like this

4526.48 --> 4529.759999999999
that's not

4527.36 --> 4530.799999999999
then you can't reinterpret that is it

4529.76 --> 4534.2390000000005
right

4530.8 --> 4534.8
that's been done a lot but i don't do

4534.239 --> 4537.599999999999
that

4534.8 --> 4538.2390000000005
i just look at the essence what is how

4537.6 --> 4540.719
are you

4538.239 --> 4542.08
what are you supposed to be doing how do

4540.719 --> 4545.84
you describe

4542.08 --> 4545.84
what you're supposed to be doing right

4545.92 --> 4549.4400000000005
well you're supposed to do good you're

4548.159 --> 4553.04
supposed to

4549.44 --> 4556.159
inspire support

4553.04 --> 4559.36
uh yeah reject the wicked

4556.159 --> 4562.4
publicly give an example

4559.36 --> 4564.08
in that as well and in doing good and

4562.4 --> 4566.5599999999995
yeah that's just

4564.08 --> 4568.88
a way to go about that resonates with a

4566.56 --> 4571.360000000001
certain type of frequency spiritually

4568.88 --> 4571.84
and it has all these rewards you charge

4571.36 --> 4575.5199999999995
up

4571.84 --> 4578.88
doing that that's it

4575.52 --> 4582.4800000000005
that is it that's that's the real

4578.88 --> 4583.679
esoteric christianity and the rest is

4582.48 --> 4587.199
just

4583.679 --> 4587.1990000000005
concepts and ideas

4588.0 --> 4594.719
and like consideration of

4591.04 --> 4597.28
what is after well to me

4594.719 --> 4598.0
i want to do good i want to do it like

4597.28 --> 4600.639999999999
this

4598.0 --> 4602.159
because i don't think i can be evil

4600.64 --> 4604.96
without completely

4602.159 --> 4606.719
just suffering that just doesn't seem

4604.96 --> 4607.12
like a logical option to me and i cannot

4606.719 --> 4609.76
be

4607.12 --> 4611.28
fooled into thinking that it is anymore

4609.76 --> 4614.159000000001
i used to

4611.28 --> 4614.88
be fooled into that i cannot be that

4614.159 --> 4617.04
anymore

4614.88 --> 4618.8
my consciousness has ascended to a

4617.04 --> 4619.679
certain level of oversight where i can

4618.8 --> 4622.88
no longer be

4619.679 --> 4626.56
fooled to step

4622.88 --> 4629.28
away in principle from logos i cannot

4626.56 --> 4629.280000000001
i will not

4633.12 --> 4639.5199999999995
right but yeah what comes after

4636.88 --> 4640.32
that's another matter like is it even

4639.52 --> 4642.96
like

4640.32 --> 4645.28
i don't know if there is anything after

4642.96 --> 4647.84
death for sure or if that will be

4645.28 --> 4649.04
perceived in the way that we perceive

4647.84 --> 4651.4400000000005
normal life

4649.04 --> 4652.4
or if it will just be an aspect of us

4651.44 --> 4655.759999999999
that

4652.4 --> 4658.239
moves on i cannot say

4655.76 --> 4659.1990000000005
and it's so complicated with so much

4658.239 --> 4662.159
friction

4659.199 --> 4663.04
in the beliefs of this so much friction

4662.159 --> 4666.0
if you just say

4663.04 --> 4666.8
but maybe there's nothing then you're an

4666.0 --> 4669.44
atheist

4666.8 --> 4671.12
right then you're at it well maybe it

4669.44 --> 4673.199
just doesn't matter

4671.12 --> 4674.96
maybe it's just important that we do the

4673.199 --> 4677.599999999999
right thing when we live

4674.96 --> 4679.12
maybe there's a reward maybe there's not

4677.6 --> 4680.8
but i certainly know that if you

4679.12 --> 4683.84
don't do the right thing in your life

4680.8 --> 4686.88
that in your life you will be punished

4683.84 --> 4686.88
it's as simple as that

4690.84 --> 4695.679
see

4693.76 --> 4698.0
now i definitely hope there's some kind

4695.679 --> 4699.6
of spiritual eternal afterlife would be

4698.0 --> 4702.96
fascinating

4699.6 --> 4706.96
but i cannot demand

4702.96 --> 4709.36
it i cannot say it must be

4706.96 --> 4710.88
and i don't need to i'm just gonna try

4709.36 --> 4713.36
to live my life

4710.88 --> 4715.12
feel good about myself build follow the

4713.36 --> 4716.96
right frequencies follow christ's

4715.12 --> 4720.08
example as much as i can

4716.96 --> 4724.32
and then in the end my consideration is

4720.08 --> 4724.32
either you go to heaven or

4724.64 --> 4731.280000000001
you can just finally

4727.679 --> 4733.76
let go like i've had enough

4731.28 --> 4735.12
i've done everything i needed to do i

4733.76 --> 4737.76
feel good about myself

4735.12 --> 4739.12
other fee people like me respect me will

4737.76 --> 4742.719
have fond memories of me

4739.12 --> 4743.5199999999995
it's okay to go and just not exist

4742.719 --> 4749.84
anymore

4743.52 --> 4749.84
either way either way

4754.08 --> 4756.32
see

4757.28 --> 4761.44
either way it's good as long as you just

4760.08 --> 4777.84
do good as long as you just

4761.44 --> 4777.839999999999
stop ruining everything

4790.159 --> 4793.28
karma in what sense

4793.92 --> 4797.92
if you're gonna say karma as in the

4796.8 --> 4801.04
specific

4797.92 --> 4805.28
uh hindu concept that

4801.04 --> 4808.32
relates specifically to reincarnation

4805.28 --> 4808.8
personally i don't think so or if it is

4808.32 --> 4812.08
it's a

4808.8 --> 4812.56
it's not really consequential if you're

4812.08 --> 4815.679
gonna say

4812.56 --> 4818.96
karma as a spiritual energy effect

4815.679 --> 4822.2390000000005
within life oh yeah absolutely

4818.96 --> 4825.36
it exists you'd be crazy to believe

4822.239 --> 4829.199
it doesn't exist that you don't get

4825.36 --> 4831.839999999999
what you don't reap what you sow you do

4829.199 --> 4832.799999999999
kind of everybody that's halfway decent

4831.84 --> 4835.04
or sensible

4832.8 --> 4837.04
knows this or will at least be able to

4835.04 --> 4847.84
admit it to themselves

4837.04 --> 4847.84
right that that just exists

4853.62 --> 4856.739
[Music]

4858.84 --> 4861.84
right

4862.88 --> 4866.719
yeah that's really nice good servant

4864.96 --> 4868.56
don't want to insult you but at this

4866.719 --> 4871.679
point after everything i say that's just

4868.56 --> 4875.120000000001
esoteric mumbo jumbo really

4871.679 --> 4878.32
because yes jesus offers salvation

4875.12 --> 4880.239
how does he do that by setting the

4878.32 --> 4883.5199999999995
perfect example and showing you

4880.239 --> 4883.5199999999995
how you have to do it

4883.76 --> 4891.12
that's the real part and why

4887.6 --> 4892.159000000001
accompanied with a a option for you to

4891.12 --> 4895.679
deeply

4892.159 --> 4896.48
understand how and why the bigger

4895.679 --> 4899.04
picture

4896.48 --> 4899.759999999999
he reveals that if you have the eyes to

4899.04 --> 4902.239
see

4899.76 --> 4905.6
if you have the ability to not let your

4902.239 --> 4905.599999999999
ego distract from it

4909.92 --> 4917.84
no agm it's the way he said it

4913.84 --> 4917.84
it's like a chant

4918.88 --> 4922.8
it's esoteric mumbo jumbo when you

4921.76 --> 4926.159000000001
present it

4922.8 --> 4931.04
as a literal saying like that

4926.159 --> 4934.08
because it's esoteric that's what it is

4931.04 --> 4937.0
it's all things

4934.08 --> 4939.36
that you must reify into physical

4937.0 --> 4942.0
literalism

4939.36 --> 4945.839999999999
or or you're not doing it right no no

4942.0 --> 4945.84
i'm an exoterist

4957.04 --> 4964.0
oh really at least he tried ajm

4960.56 --> 4967.76
so everything i said in the last

4964.0 --> 4968.56
10 15 minutes talking about jesus christ

4967.76 --> 4970.96
about

4968.56 --> 4972.56
the real thing about the real you think

4970.96 --> 4975.199
that is not christian

4972.56 --> 4977.04
you think that didn't listen did you agm

4975.199 --> 4980.4
you just didn't listen no no

4977.04 --> 4985.12
you heard somebody say a standardized

4980.4 --> 4988.239
chant based on pure extraterrorism

4985.12 --> 4990.32
and i i counted it i said what i

4988.239 --> 4993.04
honestly thought about it

4990.32 --> 4993.5199999999995
and now i'm not good enough anymore am i

4993.04 --> 4996.239
agm

4993.52 --> 5000.719
are you triggered are you triggered by

4996.239 --> 5002.5599999999995
esoteric neurosis are you

5000.719 --> 5004.639
you think i'm gonna respect that you're

5002.56 --> 5007.92
doing that in my chat

5004.639 --> 5011.36
after everything i've said did

5007.92 --> 5011.92
someone tried to tell tried to tell the

5011.36 --> 5014.48
truth

5011.92 --> 5015.28
oh i didn't so i didn't tell the truth

5014.48 --> 5018.159
about christ

5015.28 --> 5029.84
i lied did i did i lie hey jim are you

5018.159 --> 5029.839999999999
calling me a liar

5030.88 --> 5043.84
so i lied about christ did i agm

5043.92 --> 5047.1990000000005
that's what you imply when you say at

5046.639 --> 5050.400000000001
least

5047.199 --> 5054.159
someone tried to tell the truth about

5050.4 --> 5057.28
christ yeah you know what that means

5054.159 --> 5060.0
when you say that that means yeah

5057.28 --> 5062.159
he tried nobody else is trying so i'm

5060.0 --> 5063.36
not trying so are you calling me a liar

5062.159 --> 5065.92
then

5063.36 --> 5071.839999999999
if i'm not trying to tell the truth are

5065.92 --> 5071.84
you calling me a liar agm

5075.44 --> 5079.759999999999
my version so my version is incorrect is

5079.04 --> 5083.04
it

5079.76 --> 5085.1990000000005
i'm not right maybe you need to go again

5083.04 --> 5087.04
maybe you need to go and get the [ __ ]

5085.199 --> 5090.0
outta here and just join your freaking

5087.04 --> 5090.0
church group then

5090.56 --> 5099.84
if if i did it wrong

5103.84 --> 5109.4400000000005
because i think it would be wiser for

5107.199 --> 5111.678999999999
you to conclude

5109.44 --> 5114.0
that you just don't understand what i

5111.679 --> 5116.639
was saying

5114.0 --> 5118.56
so you just picked up on hey the

5116.639 --> 5120.96
standard esoteric chant

5118.56 --> 5121.76
somebody is saying it oh arwin is going

5120.96 --> 5123.6
against it

5121.76 --> 5125.360000000001
that means that everything that was kind

5123.6 --> 5127.120000000001
of blurry i didn't really get before

5125.36 --> 5129.839999999999
that ten minutes before that

5127.12 --> 5131.199
i'm just gonna ignore it and say oh we

5129.84 --> 5133.4400000000005
got a denier

5131.199 --> 5134.96
we got a denier neurotic you're a

5133.44 --> 5136.719
neurotic agm

5134.96 --> 5139.199
maybe you should stop it maybe you

5136.719 --> 5142.32
should stop yourself from doing that

5139.199 --> 5144.08
because you're gonna piss me off again i

5142.32 --> 5147.12
hate it when you do that

5144.08 --> 5149.5199999999995
don't try to backstab me and call me

5147.12 --> 5154.08
a bad christian or a wrong christian

5149.52 --> 5157.84
don't you [ __ ] dare buddy

5154.08 --> 5159.92
why don't you act more

5157.84 --> 5160.96
in accordance to christ instead of

5159.92 --> 5164.2390000000005
sticking to

5160.96 --> 5169.04
acid esoteric neurosis

5164.239 --> 5170.718999999999
pisses me off

5169.04 --> 5172.639
and i'd say the same thing to good

5170.719 --> 5175.04
servant if i

5172.639 --> 5176.88
didn't already kind of do that on a

5175.04 --> 5182.8
regular basis and he knows it and he's

5176.88 --> 5186.8
trying to do something about it

5182.8 --> 5186.8
yeah you did you did ajm

5187.92 --> 5192.719
do i need to read it out again do i need

5190.96 --> 5198.32
to read it out

5192.719 --> 5198.32
i will let me find it

5206.88 --> 5214.2390000000005
jets pretty spammed under

5211.28 --> 5214.239
where the [ __ ] is he

5216.239 --> 5220.0
did somebody time him out or something

5221.76 --> 5225.84
what the

5227.679 --> 5234.2390000000005
oh right here it is yeah yeah 3 23

5231.12 --> 5236.88
yes at least someone tried to tell the

5234.239 --> 5238.799999999999
truth about christ

5236.88 --> 5240.400000000001
and that's obviously in response to good

5238.8 --> 5243.84
servant who said

5240.4 --> 5247.36
yes i tried my best anyway

5243.84 --> 5249.04
right well what he said does not imply

5247.36 --> 5251.599999999999
that i'm doing something wrong it just

5249.04 --> 5255.04
implies that he's trying to do his best

5251.6 --> 5257.92
what you're saying is that

5255.04 --> 5259.36
you're you're saying that only someone

5257.92 --> 5260.719
is doing their best yeah that's what

5259.36 --> 5263.679
that means

5260.719 --> 5263.679
it's what that means

5265.44 --> 5268.48
yeah i just read it out that's what that

5267.44 --> 5271.12
means

5268.48 --> 5271.12
do you get it

5271.84 --> 5275.679
yeah that's your words you didn't mean

5274.159 --> 5277.44
it you didn't mean it

5275.679 --> 5280.159
well maybe you should get a bit more

5277.44 --> 5282.32
grip on the way you present things

5280.159 --> 5283.679
realize what is actually what you're

5282.32 --> 5286.0
saying

5283.679 --> 5287.84
don't let the neurosis slip through

5286.0 --> 5291.04
don't do it anyway

5287.84 --> 5291.04
no it's called judging

5291.28 --> 5295.28
you're saying i'm not doing it right

5293.199 --> 5298.638999999999
that's what you said with that

5295.28 --> 5302.0
yeah it pisses me off

5298.639 --> 5305.84
don't do that again ever

5302.0 --> 5308.639
if you are then just say it to my face

5305.84 --> 5310.639
just say no i disagree i think you're

5308.639 --> 5312.96
making a big mistake arwen you're not

5310.639 --> 5314.8
following the bible correctly

5312.96 --> 5317.28
because you don't believe these very

5314.8 --> 5319.360000000001
specific esoteric statements that you

5317.28 --> 5320.5599999999995
must or everybody will look away from

5319.36 --> 5324.32
you

5320.56 --> 5328.159000000001
right yeah that's what you think then

5324.32 --> 5330.799999999999
why don't you just say it don't

5328.159 --> 5332.48
don't backhandedly tell me that i'm

5330.8 --> 5336.56
incorrect

5332.48 --> 5339.678999999999
thank you very much

5336.56 --> 5344.0
don't tell me to calm down either

5339.679 --> 5344.0
or i will ban your ass this is on you

5344.08 --> 5351.84
this is on you

5362.84 --> 5365.84
uh

5385.04 --> 5396.639
sure you were

5392.88 --> 5398.88
ah christ the freaking firefox crashed

5396.639 --> 5398.88
again

5400.48 --> 5407.839999999999
well i'm gonna run out the show anyway

5408.159 --> 5412.48
twisting his attempt i don't know i

5410.639 --> 5414.4800000000005
don't know i don't think so

5412.48 --> 5416.718999999999
somebody says well at least someone is

5414.48 --> 5420.718999999999
trying to do their best that means that

5416.719 --> 5422.719
that literally unmistakably implies

5420.719 --> 5424.08
that you're singling someone out because

5422.719 --> 5427.92
they are doing their best

5424.08 --> 5430.88
implying very directly and unmistakably

5427.92 --> 5433.679
that the rest isn't okay that's

5430.88 --> 5435.76
literally what that means rastad don't

5433.679 --> 5438.32
don't downplay this [ __ ] i know what i'm

5435.76 --> 5438.320000000001
talking about

5439.84 --> 5444.32
doesn't matter if he was addressing

5441.36 --> 5445.92
anybody else i was being very specific

5444.32 --> 5447.12
in what i was saying and i was laying

5445.92 --> 5450.4
down a sensitive

5447.12 --> 5453.12
thing about the conception of

5450.4 --> 5455.199
afterlife or not afterlife how i do it

5453.12 --> 5457.5199999999995
if somebody then just says

5455.199 --> 5458.96
starts blabbering exoteric things and

5457.52 --> 5460.56
they say something about it

5458.96 --> 5462.0
and somebody else is going to get pissy

5460.56 --> 5465.120000000001
like agm saying well

5462.0 --> 5467.12
at least he tried that means that you're

5465.12 --> 5468.96
literally saying yeah i didn't listen to

5467.12 --> 5470.8
a [ __ ] word you said

5468.96 --> 5473.44
or i just don't agree and i think it's

5470.8 --> 5475.4400000000005
stupid it's wrong

5473.44 --> 5477.5199999999995
that's what that means and i'm very

5475.44 --> 5478.719
sensitive about this [ __ ] especially

5477.52 --> 5483.4400000000005
with agm

5478.719 --> 5483.44
especially you buddy because we got a

5488.84 --> 5493.84
