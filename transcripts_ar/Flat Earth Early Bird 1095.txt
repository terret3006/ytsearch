[Music]

53.719 --> 57.92
good morning

55.76 --> 59.76
welcome to flat earth early bird number

57.92 --> 62.0
1095

59.76 --> 64.08
i'm your host arwyn and before i start

62.0 --> 66.72
the show please don't forget to share it

64.08 --> 68.79899999999999
on any platform you deem fit and if you

66.72 --> 70.72
haven't already subscribe to my channel

68.799 --> 72.56
and hit the bell notification so you

70.72 --> 74.4
know when i'm going live which is

72.56 --> 76.4
normally 1 pm amsterdam time in the

74.4 --> 79.43900000000001
weekdays and 2 pm amsterdam time in the

76.4 --> 81.43900000000001
weekend and please also do support me

79.439 --> 83.03999999999999
through the paypal patreon crypto wallet

81.439 --> 84.15899999999999
super chat and the membership system

83.04 --> 87.799
join button

84.159 --> 87.799
it'll be much appreciated

88.64 --> 92.72
please keep the support coming if you

90.479 --> 92.72
can

93.2 --> 98.96000000000001
right the weather today is

95.84 --> 98.96000000000001
big gray soup day

99.439 --> 101.83999999999999
it's

102.0 --> 108.32
still a bit of a breeze going on but

104.799 --> 108.32000000000001
it's not it's like slow

109.119 --> 113.28
but it is kind of cold outside

111.6 --> 116.0
i think it's water cold i'll check the

113.28 --> 117.68
temperature after this

116.0 --> 122.64
but yeah it's

117.68 --> 122.64
definitely a big great soup kind of day

123.6 --> 127.759
so yeah i don't expect to see the sun

125.68 --> 128.56
any time soon but who knows it might

127.759 --> 130.959
just

128.56 --> 134.959
change around

130.959 --> 134.959
it has been doing that a lot so

138.8 --> 141.8
um

143.68 --> 150.48000000000002
hello bill nye the science denier first

146.64 --> 154.48
in chat jeff gas head nathan oakley 1980

150.48 --> 160.83999999999997
elise g good to see you all

154.48 --> 160.84
it is thursday the 9th of december 2021.

165.84 --> 170.12
so how are you all doing

173.12 --> 178.48000000000002
yesterday was a

174.959 --> 178.48
it's a good day yeah

178.8 --> 182.36
what happened again

185.36 --> 190.31900000000002
yeah flat earth debates

187.04 --> 190.319
yesterday great

190.8 --> 195.04000000000002
it's really cool

192.879 --> 195.92
although yeah nathan you shouldn't like

195.04 --> 198.56
and

195.92 --> 200.39999999999998
when it's that focused

198.56 --> 202.56
and everybody's that focus it's like a

200.4 --> 204.48000000000002
real ways to end the after show that

202.56 --> 208.159
early

204.48 --> 209.76
so we were all bit disappointed when you

208.159 --> 211.84
when you rounded that out we could have

209.76 --> 214.64
all gone for like at least another one

211.84 --> 218.56
and a half hour

214.64 --> 218.55999999999997
but yeah it's of course your show

222.08 --> 225.959
hello daniel robles

227.2 --> 231.76
six inches of snow last night newham

230.319 --> 235.439
sheer right

231.76 --> 237.67999999999998
new hampshire right what

235.439 --> 239.519
uh

237.68 --> 241.84
right so yeah there's some snow here and

239.519 --> 241.84
there

242.239 --> 246.08
but yeah not over here though

251.76 --> 258.32
waiting for some sticky back rubber feet

256.639 --> 263.56
i i take it

258.32 --> 263.56
you mean for your uh for your equipment

270.08 --> 275.19899999999996
yeah i saw the photo you put there in

272.8 --> 275.199
skype

276.08 --> 281.12
cool

278.16 --> 281.12
that's a real bargain

281.28 --> 283.84
i think

293.199 --> 296.759
right uh

303.199 --> 307.44
ah yeah yeah now remember uh mitchell

305.44 --> 308.56
from australia man mitchell is like

307.44 --> 311.199
really

308.56 --> 312.96
rolling on

311.199 --> 315.36
a lot of great shows but

312.96 --> 318.15999999999997
he had uh rob durham on

315.36 --> 318.16
live this time

321.28 --> 327.039
and it was yeah it was interesting

323.68 --> 327.039
more elaboration on

328.4 --> 332.4
on his findings

330.479 --> 334.88
with the map

332.4 --> 336.4
but yeah yesterday i i kind of had like

334.88 --> 338.639
a

336.4 --> 338.63899999999995
even

338.96 --> 342.479
okay

340.24 --> 344.08
hello good servant

342.479 --> 346.639
yeah yesterday with the guys after the

344.08 --> 350.0
after show was rounded out i still had a

346.639 --> 350.0
pretty long conversation

350.8 --> 354.72
because yeah

352.72 --> 357.03900000000004
there was some confusion

354.72 --> 359.6
on my part

357.039 --> 361.36
concerning the

359.6 --> 362.47900000000004
angle

361.36 --> 363.84000000000003
of the

362.479 --> 366.639
axis

363.84 --> 368.56
of the celestial sphere

366.639 --> 370.8
in relation to the map

368.56 --> 372.8
and to be fair it's it's still not

370.8 --> 374.96000000000004
perfectly cleared up

372.8 --> 376.8
for me

374.96 --> 379.039
but i thought

376.8 --> 381.28000000000003
that it was like

379.039 --> 383.68
that i have been stumbling onto

381.28 --> 385.19899999999996
something new specific but then the guys

383.68 --> 387.28000000000003
kind of like

385.199 --> 390.479
said like no no no no you're

387.28 --> 393.28
misinterpreting something and then yeah

390.479 --> 395.28
because i

393.28 --> 396.55999999999995
like been building some suspicion for a

395.28 --> 399.11999999999995
while and

396.56 --> 401.199
i thought it was on the right track that

399.12 --> 402.96
basically the

401.199 --> 406.0
rotation

402.96 --> 408.63899999999995
well not the the rotation

406.0 --> 411.12
about the axis of the celestial

408.639 --> 413.039
demisphere or sphere we always see a

411.12 --> 415.599
demisphere but

413.039 --> 417.44
virtual complete sphere

415.599 --> 419.84
because it always rotates at a

417.44 --> 420.71999999999997
consistent rate around its axis around

419.84 --> 423.28
the

420.72 --> 428.40000000000003
polaris and southern cross

423.28 --> 429.919
virtual axis that never changes that but

428.4 --> 434.4
the way

429.919 --> 436.639
how much the axis of the globe rotates

434.4 --> 439.67999999999995
where polaris moves more

436.639 --> 441.84000000000003
above you as you go north

439.68 --> 443.759
and the southern cross moves more above

441.84 --> 446.63899999999995
you as you go south

443.759 --> 449.36
that the rate

446.639 --> 452.319
of that rotation

449.36 --> 454.0
is non-linear

452.319 --> 457.599
that

454.0 --> 457.599
that's what i'm trying to find out

459.44 --> 465.36
basically whether that notion is correct

461.44 --> 469.039
because i've had hints from that

465.36 --> 469.84000000000003
even years ago way back

469.039 --> 471.759
like

469.84 --> 474.0
when you go north

471.759 --> 476.24
it's like from the equator you go north

474.0 --> 479.12
and it's like oh yeah this much distance

476.24 --> 480.72
this much rotation of the axis

479.12 --> 483.44
but then

480.72 --> 485.44000000000005
i've heard that if you go north

483.44 --> 487.52
and just and this wasn't due to

485.44 --> 489.84
refraction

487.52 --> 492.15999999999997
right because there's also refraction

489.84 --> 496.4
issues at the super cold region where

492.16 --> 496.40000000000003
even the stars are slightly deviated

496.479 --> 500.8
but i was under the impression that

498.639 --> 504.0
basically the amount

500.8 --> 506.72
the axis of the

504.0 --> 509.28
of the globe of the heavens rotates

506.72 --> 512.64
slows down

509.28 --> 514.3199999999999
the further no north you go

512.64 --> 516.24
but i don't know

514.32 --> 519.12
for sure

516.24 --> 519.12
it was hints

519.519 --> 525.44
hints way back in descriptions

523.039 --> 528.0
of people just

525.44 --> 532.399
keeping track of like star orientations

528.0 --> 532.399
in relation to the map etc etc

532.72 --> 535.72
uh

544.48 --> 549.36
i got into an argument with a guy

546.64 --> 551.92
debunking gravity i told him show me

549.36 --> 553.6
curved space time and yeah yeah

551.92 --> 557.04
no yeah einstein it's purely

553.6 --> 559.519
mathematical conception

557.04 --> 560.959
it's not even a mathematical description

559.519 --> 563.519
of a

560.959 --> 564.7199999999999
thing that's palpably going on in the

563.519 --> 566.5600000000001
world

564.72 --> 568.72
so basically it's a mathematical

566.56 --> 571.5999999999999
conception not even a description right

568.72 --> 574.24
math should normally be a description

571.6 --> 575.2
should be describing

574.24 --> 578.16
things

575.2 --> 578.1600000000001
like in the world

578.48 --> 582.9590000000001
like you describe something with

579.92 --> 585.5999999999999
language but einstein basically conjured

582.959 --> 588.88
an entire fictional medium

585.6 --> 592.32
to describe things in it

588.88 --> 593.4399999999999
and then basically claim like it's a

592.32 --> 595.12
sub

593.44 --> 598.6400000000001
dimension

595.12 --> 600.72
of the regular 3d realm dimension

598.64 --> 602.8
but there's absolutely no hint of

600.72 --> 604.64
evidence for this

602.8 --> 608.88
right there's no proof for his

604.64 --> 608.88
pseudo-romanian four-space conceptions

616.48 --> 622.16
hello professor phil fell

619.279 --> 624.399
time dilation is a thing

622.16 --> 627.04
no

624.399 --> 627.04
no it's not

627.68 --> 632.1999999999999
hello snowbirds also in chat

652.64 --> 657.76
yeah professor filbo you're gonna back

654.399 --> 657.76
that statement with anything

658.72 --> 662.24
like

659.519 --> 664.0
it's a thing really how do you know

662.24 --> 667.279
what what's your

664.0 --> 669.68
in-world physical evidence

667.279 --> 672.8389999999999
for time dilation

669.68 --> 677.5999999999999
based on more than

672.839 --> 677.6
presuppositional apparent long-distance

677.76 --> 681.2
visuals

679.279 --> 682.959
and derivations

681.2 --> 684.9590000000001
from its mechanics somehow

682.959 --> 685.92
mathematically right

684.959 --> 688.7199999999999
because

685.92 --> 690.8
everything you're going to base any

688.72 --> 692.48
space-time theory or anything that

690.8 --> 693.519
you're going to base on celestial

692.48 --> 698.16
sightings

693.519 --> 699.68
rests solely on the presuppositional

698.16 --> 703.1999999999999
foundation

699.68 --> 705.12
that they are the heliocentric cosmos

703.2 --> 707.12
the assumption of that that's the only

705.12 --> 709.6
thing where any

707.12 --> 711.839
anything like that is ever derived from

709.6 --> 714.0
but that doesn't prove anything because

711.839 --> 716.9590000000001
it rests on these presuppositions that

714.0 --> 719.279
are already kind of feeble at best

716.959 --> 720.7199999999999
so if you want to demonstrate time

719.279 --> 723.2
dilation

720.72 --> 725.6800000000001
you're going to have to find a

723.2 --> 727.6
like physical

725.68 --> 729.4399999999999
measurable

727.6 --> 731.839
phenomenon for it

729.44 --> 731.839
right

731.92 --> 737.12
atomic clocks

733.68 --> 740.079
on fast moving objects

737.12 --> 741.519
oh so you think atomic clocks

740.079 --> 742.8
are literally

741.519 --> 745.6
time

742.8 --> 746.8
you you think that an atomic clock

745.6 --> 752.16
has the

746.8 --> 752.16
natural phenomenon of time in it do you

754.88 --> 760.16
well then you don't understand what time

756.72 --> 761.6800000000001
is because the only thing that atomic

760.16 --> 765.36
clocks

761.68 --> 766.959
really do is just have a very stable

765.36 --> 768.32
process

766.959 --> 770.56
from which

768.32 --> 771.6
a rhythmic

770.56 --> 774.88
time

771.6 --> 776.9590000000001
derivation can be extracted

774.88 --> 779.519
there's no actual time because time is a

776.959 --> 779.5189999999999
concept

781.68 --> 786.3199999999999
right and yeah if you're already gonna

783.76 --> 788.72
say like oh it's so stable so stable

786.32 --> 789.9200000000001
that thing you know it's so reliable the

788.72 --> 792.88
time

789.92 --> 794.959
but when you go up it changes well yeah

792.88 --> 797.76
the conclusion that i draw from that

794.959 --> 800.399
it's not that stable

797.76 --> 802.3199999999999
right that's not my conclusion

800.399 --> 804.48
from that isn't going to be like oh that

802.32 --> 806.32
means there's time dilation no that just

804.48 --> 808.8000000000001
means wait atomic clocks are super

806.32 --> 810.399
stable unless you start vertically

808.8 --> 812.079
moving them

810.399 --> 815.44
because then somehow they work

812.079 --> 818.079
differently it's not that time works

815.44 --> 818.0790000000001
differently

818.48 --> 822.88
it's that the clock works differently

823.44 --> 826.48
professor phil bell

827.12 --> 832.9590000000001
call it what it like its effect yeah

829.12 --> 835.199
everything i just said is a fact indeed

832.959 --> 837.04
all you need to do is just take what i

835.199 --> 838.4799999999999
just said

837.04 --> 839.92
put it on

838.48 --> 841.839
what you're saying

839.92 --> 843.92
and then you realize

841.839 --> 848.1600000000001
wait

843.92 --> 851.04
i mistakenly assumed a phenomenon

848.16 --> 855.24
based on a derived concept from a

851.04 --> 855.24
mechanical man-made device

856.079 --> 862.2399999999999
no the time check yeah chant for me

858.0 --> 862.24
fundy now you're just chanting

865.519 --> 871.48
flux capacitor requires the very time

868.48 --> 871.48
low

879.279 --> 884.639
you're an expert but you're an expert on

882.079 --> 887.519
misunderstanding

884.639 --> 889.519
what time even officially is

887.519 --> 893.079
and then taking a

889.519 --> 895.44
man-made device based phenomenon and

893.079 --> 899.12
mistakingly thinking that it is

895.44 --> 900.8000000000001
literally holding the phenomenon of time

899.12 --> 903.839
that's what you're doing

900.8 --> 903.8389999999999
professor fill bell

904.88 --> 910.079
taking a man-made device and then you're

907.44 --> 913.36
assuming that it

910.079 --> 915.04
has the phenomenon of time in it

913.36 --> 917.839
it doesn't

915.04 --> 921.279
time is a derived concept

917.839 --> 922.72
now if there is a stability issue within

921.279 --> 925.12
this time

922.72 --> 927.44
system the atomic clock thing

925.12 --> 928.48
when you move it vertically well that

927.44 --> 931.0400000000001
means

928.48 --> 935.1990000000001
there is basically a deviation in the

931.04 --> 937.36
stability of its system not that time

935.199 --> 940.24
itself changes

937.36 --> 942.88
i do not make a mistake in my job

940.24 --> 944.88
well i wonder if over at your job they

942.88 --> 946.24
get to see what you're blabbering about

944.88 --> 948.48
here online

946.24 --> 951.519
professor field bell because you're just

948.48 --> 951.519
embarrassing yourself

953.519 --> 958.24
if this is really your job then you

955.519 --> 961.92
should know better than this

958.24 --> 961.92
this is just embarrassing bro

967.199 --> 971.3599999999999
if you really want to be a professional

970.56 --> 972.88
then

971.36 --> 974.32
act like it

972.88 --> 976.959
realize

974.32 --> 978.24
what you're talking about what we've

976.959 --> 982.0
figured out

978.24 --> 984.399
which is all based in in reality

982.0 --> 986.56
concerning the space time bending and

984.399 --> 988.959
time dilate all that we know what that

986.56 --> 991.5999999999999
is we figured that out

988.959 --> 992.8
right it's even official

991.6 --> 994.0790000000001
so

992.8 --> 996.399
move on

994.079 --> 999.12
from your science fiction dream that you

996.399 --> 1002.56
can actually manipulate time

999.12 --> 1004.88
by changing coordinates

1002.56 --> 1008.0
and then yeah things might get a little

1004.88 --> 1009.6
bit more insightful for you

1008.0 --> 1012.0
right you might learn something out of

1009.6 --> 1013.9200000000001
this and you might actually help out

1012.0 --> 1015.6
your colleagues i assume you have

1013.92 --> 1018.4799999999999
colleagues

1015.6 --> 1021.12
inform them about their mistake that

1018.48 --> 1024.519
you've had that we're trying to correct

1021.12 --> 1024.519
now for you

1025.679 --> 1028.5590000000002
you'll be thankful

1031.039 --> 1036.199
hey slow mo moon buggy welcome to chat

1043.439 --> 1050.96
yeah yeah nathan when did you become

1047.199 --> 1053.8400000000001
an expert at a specifically man-made

1050.96 --> 1053.8400000000001
device

1054.16 --> 1060.559
that is could never be a viable

1056.96 --> 1060.559
basis for a hypothesis

1063.28 --> 1067.2
right you don't need to be an expert or

1065.919 --> 1069.8400000000001
engineer

1067.2 --> 1072.96
knowing like how the mechanism of an

1069.84 --> 1074.9599999999998
atomic clock works to realize you can't

1072.96 --> 1077.6000000000001
use it

1074.96 --> 1080.0
for the groundworks in any viable

1077.6 --> 1083.1999999999998
hypothesis because it's clearly an

1080.0 --> 1085.679
unnatural not naturally forming man-made

1083.2 --> 1085.679
device

1085.76 --> 1089.44
and what is it

1087.36 --> 1090.799
it's a rhythmic

1089.44 --> 1093.28
system

1090.799 --> 1095.6
from which you can

1093.28 --> 1098.559
derive time and as long as you don't

1095.6 --> 1100.8799999999999
move it vertically apparently it's very

1098.559 --> 1103.6
stable and that's very useful right

1100.88 --> 1105.3600000000001
rhythmic stability is very stable stable

1103.6 --> 1108.48
thing that's useful

1105.36 --> 1111.1999999999998
you can use that to keep track of

1108.48 --> 1112.16
time which is a derived concept

1111.2 --> 1114.559
right

1112.16 --> 1116.799
but just because the mechanism from

1114.559 --> 1121.2
which you derive time

1116.799 --> 1122.96
has weird rhythmic inconsistencies

1121.2 --> 1126.24
when you move vertically doesn't mean

1122.96 --> 1129.6000000000001
that time the thing you've derived

1126.24 --> 1131.44
is actually a palpable

1129.6 --> 1134.559
phenomenon

1131.44 --> 1137.3600000000001
that's where you make a mistake

1134.559 --> 1140.84
i'm seriously trying to help you here

1137.36 --> 1140.84
professor filwell

1151.76 --> 1158.24
oh right yeah brandon lee i'm not gonna

1154.64 --> 1162.8400000000001
talk about that but yes

1158.24 --> 1162.84
was it like 20 years ago yeah

1169.44 --> 1172.96
it happened once

1171.28 --> 1176.72
and that was uh

1172.96 --> 1176.72
more that that was more than enough

1177.039 --> 1182.8799999999999
but we're talking about science now

1180.88 --> 1184.0
oh wow that's nasty yeah yeah and you're

1182.88 --> 1186.88
banned now

1184.0 --> 1189.2
because you're obviously just starting

1186.88 --> 1191.679
at home [ __ ] when we're talking

1189.2 --> 1195.88
technical arguments here

1191.679 --> 1195.88
so get the [ __ ] out

1215.12 --> 1219.52
i get paid what you get paid to

1217.6 --> 1221.4399999999998
misunderstand what you're talking about

1219.52 --> 1223.039
professor phil bill i wouldn't be

1221.44 --> 1225.039
surprised

1223.039 --> 1227.12
i mean

1225.039 --> 1228.799
perpetuating

1227.12 --> 1232.039
confusion

1228.799 --> 1235.52
is a paying job in this world right

1232.039 --> 1237.679
misinformation is an industry

1235.52 --> 1240.32
right misinformation is like the mind

1237.679 --> 1241.8400000000001
food to keep people dumb keeping people

1240.32 --> 1242.799
dumb

1241.84 --> 1244.799
is

1242.799 --> 1247.12
a strategy

1244.799 --> 1248.48
it's a strategy for control

1247.12 --> 1251.28
and yeah

1248.48 --> 1253.679
it's worth investing in for those people

1251.28 --> 1254.799
that want that strategy con strategic

1253.679 --> 1256.96
control

1254.799 --> 1258.799
so yeah

1256.96 --> 1262.64
you get paid

1258.799 --> 1263.9189999999999
to make to spread your misunderstanding

1262.64 --> 1265.2800000000002
that's right

1263.919 --> 1267.679
that doesn't surprise me at all

1265.28 --> 1270.799
professor phil bell

1267.679 --> 1270.799
you and half the world

1271.36 --> 1275.6789999999999
the work i do work so yeah i know it

1274.64 --> 1278.0800000000002
works

1275.679 --> 1280.159
i know

1278.08 --> 1281.9189999999999
but yeah you're not paying attention

1280.159 --> 1284.64
though

1281.919 --> 1286.7990000000002
because we've including myself and

1284.64 --> 1288.88
people in chat have now explained it to

1286.799 --> 1292.4
you in detail

1288.88 --> 1295.0390000000002
your misapprehension

1292.4 --> 1295.039
about time

1299.6 --> 1301.9189999999999
right

1303.679 --> 1309.2800000000002
it's a derived concept

1306.96 --> 1313.679
it's not a natural phenomenon

1309.28 --> 1313.6789999999999
especially not in a man-made device

1315.12 --> 1319.84
so before you're gonna

1317.28 --> 1322.1589999999999
think that time bending is a thing to

1319.84 --> 1324.0
supposedly support any kind of

1322.159 --> 1325.8400000000001
pseudo-ramonian

1324.0 --> 1328.32
einsteinian mechanics you're going to

1325.84 --> 1330.32
have to first

1328.32 --> 1332.48
confirm time

1330.32 --> 1334.48
as a phenomenon

1332.48 --> 1337.84
well

1334.48 --> 1340.4
just taking the rhythm of a clock

1337.84 --> 1343.6
and any deviation in such

1340.4 --> 1345.52
does not suffice

1343.6 --> 1348.08
i'm sorry

1345.52 --> 1350.08
you cannot it's just a mechanical device

1348.08 --> 1353.6
with a rhythmic process

1350.08 --> 1358.039
from which you are deriving time as a

1353.6 --> 1358.039
concept not a natural phenomenon

1377.039 --> 1383.36
it's gonna be one of those days isn't it

1379.919 --> 1383.3600000000001
does not suffice for what

1384.0 --> 1386.64
i don't know

1386.799 --> 1391.44
what doesn't it suffice for i mean i've

1390.0 --> 1393.76
just been

1391.44 --> 1396.96
telling you for like 20 minutes

1393.76 --> 1396.96
did you forget all that

1397.12 --> 1402.76
you're having some learning problems

1399.039 --> 1402.76
professor phil bell

1417.84 --> 1422.039
hello by the way clap ruckus

1430.799 --> 1433.799
uh

1457.6 --> 1461.32
hello gadget inspector

1480.24 --> 1482.64
crickets

1481.36 --> 1484.0
a bit

1482.64 --> 1487.72
seems like he's

1484.0 --> 1487.72
gone away now

1487.76 --> 1490.96
or maybe he's just waiting for nathan

1489.36 --> 1492.24
oakley to drop

1490.96 --> 1494.96
it's probably a little bit too

1492.24 --> 1497.36
intimidating

1494.96 --> 1499.8400000000001
all right still there

1497.36 --> 1503.4399999999998
it's simple a clock

1499.84 --> 1504.8799999999999
on the object moving faster

1503.44 --> 1506.799
slows down

1504.88 --> 1510.24
in comparison

1506.799 --> 1512.24
to exactly the same clock on an object

1510.24 --> 1515.559
not moving

1512.24 --> 1515.559
oh really

1515.6 --> 1518.24
does it now

1519.44 --> 1522.88
so you're saying

1521.12 --> 1524.6399999999999
that you take a

1522.88 --> 1526.24
train circuit

1524.64 --> 1528.64
a circle

1526.24 --> 1530.559
you have two identical clocks

1528.64 --> 1533.1200000000001
you leave one clock at the starting

1530.559 --> 1535.76
point it's somewhere at the rails and

1533.12 --> 1539.279
the other you put on the train

1535.76 --> 1540.24
and drive a circle for a period of time

1539.279 --> 1542.64
and then

1540.24 --> 1544.88
after i don't know how long

1542.64 --> 1547.919
the clocks will show a difference is

1544.88 --> 1547.919
that what you're saying

1549.44 --> 1552.96
i'd like to see some

1551.76 --> 1556.76
evidence

1552.96 --> 1556.76
to support that

1559.679 --> 1564.0800000000002
right it would only prove a mechanical

1562.08 --> 1566.48
deviation though

1564.08 --> 1568.32
right since you are actually one would

1566.48 --> 1570.799
be standing still the other is being

1568.32 --> 1573.279
subjected to forces

1570.799 --> 1575.12
because of moving and all that

1573.279 --> 1577.6
but i've never even heard of this like

1575.12 --> 1580.32
if that were the case then

1577.6 --> 1582.7199999999998
like literally like watches and all that

1580.32 --> 1586.6399999999999
they would become quite unreliable for

1582.72 --> 1588.48
travelers like what what use is that

1586.64 --> 1590.4
right if you're gonna have like watches

1588.48 --> 1591.919
and [ __ ] and you have to

1590.4 --> 1594.5590000000002
commute

1591.919 --> 1596.72
like two or four days

1594.559 --> 1599.039
four hours a day

1596.72 --> 1600.0
to get to your work and back to your

1599.039 --> 1601.919
home

1600.0 --> 1604.32
well you're constantly then have to

1601.919 --> 1606.96
gonna change your freaking watch because

1604.32 --> 1609.12
every time you travel

1606.96 --> 1614.4
it starts to deviate

1609.12 --> 1614.3999999999999
that sounds extremely unlikely

1615.6 --> 1619.039
because that would literally make

1618.0 --> 1623.76
time

1619.039 --> 1623.76
deriving mechanisms unreliable

1625.679 --> 1630.0800000000002
right i've never heard of this like oh

1627.6 --> 1632.7199999999998
guys look we've traveled

1630.08 --> 1635.6
so now we have to like slightly adjust

1632.72 --> 1638.88
our clocks like a minute or so

1635.6 --> 1640.9599999999998
because we moved for a period that's

1638.88 --> 1644.159
the most ridiculous

1640.96 --> 1644.159
idea i've ever heard

1652.64 --> 1657.1200000000001
i watches in time yeah i know but i'm

1654.64 --> 1659.279
not i'm not even entertaining the claim

1657.12 --> 1660.559
i'm just going by what he said and he

1659.279 --> 1663.36
said that

1660.559 --> 1663.36
when you move

1663.6 --> 1667.12
literally the mechanism

1665.919 --> 1670.3200000000002
is different

1667.12 --> 1670.32
it's not mechanical

1674.32 --> 1680.24
oh so the deviation

1676.72 --> 1681.919
so it's literally insignificant

1680.24 --> 1684.96
so your claim is

1681.919 --> 1686.96
it's so unbelievably insignificant the

1684.96 --> 1688.88
amount of deviation

1686.96 --> 1691.919
that you would literally have to spend

1688.88 --> 1694.5590000000002
like a hundred years of moving

1691.919 --> 1696.96
versus a hundred years of standing still

1694.559 --> 1700.1589999999999
of the same mechanism before you can

1696.96 --> 1703.1200000000001
even see the difference

1700.159 --> 1703.1200000000001
that's convenient

1705.919 --> 1710.72
could you perhaps

1707.76 --> 1713.84
attribute the change due to

1710.72 --> 1715.679
entropy to typical mechanical flaws over

1713.84 --> 1717.52
time perhaps

1715.679 --> 1720.5590000000002
because hey it's still we're dealing

1717.52 --> 1721.76
with man-made devices

1720.559 --> 1724.559
they

1721.76 --> 1726.64
wear over time there might be unforeseen

1724.559 --> 1728.0
little things happening

1726.64 --> 1730.48
there

1728.0 --> 1730.48
so i

1732.24 --> 1738.559
hey dave weiss

1734.559 --> 1741.2
interesting to see you in chat

1738.559 --> 1741.2
good morning

1744.96 --> 1750.48
it's not insignificant for your work

1748.48 --> 1753.84
what

1750.48 --> 1753.84
no it no it's not

1753.919 --> 1757.6000000000001
no it's

1755.84 --> 1760.48
literally

1757.6 --> 1764.7199999999998
insignificant you'd realize that the

1760.48 --> 1769.2
meaning of the word right significant

1764.72 --> 1771.919
the number within the deviation is zero

1769.2 --> 1771.919
according to you

1777.159 --> 1782.24
0.000016745 deviate that's

1780.559 --> 1783.6
literally

1782.24 --> 1785.36
officially

1783.6 --> 1786.32
insignificant

1785.36 --> 1787.84
yeah

1786.32 --> 1791.4399999999998
that's so small

1787.84 --> 1791.4399999999998
it's literally negligible

1792.24 --> 1796.64
now any weird

1794.48 --> 1798.799
theoretical things

1796.64 --> 1801.919
like purely conceptual

1798.799 --> 1804.32
theories that you might derive from that

1801.919 --> 1806.64
and speculate on that is gonna be a

1804.32 --> 1808.8799999999999
complete waste of time

1806.64 --> 1811.3600000000001
because it's never going to be

1808.88 --> 1814.3200000000002
practically utilized ever because it's

1811.36 --> 1817.039
insignificant the amount of deviation is

1814.32 --> 1817.039
negligible

1818.08 --> 1821.52
right

1820.159 --> 1823.679
before

1821.52 --> 1826.96
you can get a number like that in a

1823.679 --> 1829.279
deviation to become significant

1826.96 --> 1831.44
literally the mechanical device which

1829.279 --> 1835.279
you always have to use

1831.44 --> 1838.3990000000001
for that deviation is gonna break down

1835.279 --> 1838.399
and start to show

1838.48 --> 1843.039
well its own mechanical deviations

1840.799 --> 1845.9189999999999
because it's a mechanical device and it

1843.039 --> 1847.84
wears over time might be unforeseen

1845.919 --> 1852.0800000000002
issues right

1847.84 --> 1856.039
so yeah that's an unescapable loop

1852.08 --> 1856.039
you've cut yourself into

1875.76 --> 1879.72
i'll ask big ben

1884.799 --> 1887.9189999999999
insignificant for do

1891.6 --> 1894.399
i just did

1899.519 --> 1903.44
i just i just did that

1902.559 --> 1904.96
like

1903.44 --> 1906.559
maybe

1904.96 --> 1908.799
maybe stop

1906.559 --> 1911.76
asking the questions

1908.799 --> 1913.84
right after i made the explanation

1911.76 --> 1917.12
how about that ballers how about that

1913.84 --> 1919.84
professor phil bell this is like a habit

1917.12 --> 1921.039
this is like a habit for you

1919.84 --> 1924.9599999999998
literally

1921.039 --> 1928.32
i made an explanation in detail

1924.96 --> 1930.159
and then afterward after i'm done with

1928.32 --> 1932.24
that and it's clearly come through there

1930.159 --> 1933.7600000000002
might be a couple of seconds delay

1932.24 --> 1937.679
because of the internet a couple of

1933.76 --> 1939.519
seconds later you asked me

1937.679 --> 1941.44
why

1939.519 --> 1943.2
well i just

1941.44 --> 1946.0
told you

1943.2 --> 1948.72
and this is not like a singular occasion

1946.0 --> 1950.72
that this happens happens constantly

1948.72 --> 1953.679
i've spent shows

1950.72 --> 1956.88
entire shows like

1953.679 --> 1959.6000000000001
laying out like six things over the show

1956.88 --> 1962.0
and then every time after i finished

1959.6 --> 1964.1589999999999
rounding out the complete explanation

1962.0 --> 1969.6
the baller asks

1964.159 --> 1971.44
could you explain it i just did that

1969.6 --> 1974.24
how like how do you

1971.44 --> 1977.279
accomplish that

1974.24 --> 1980.559
every time i explain something and then

1977.279 --> 1983.84
afterwards you ask the question about it

1980.559 --> 1986.24
it's ridiculous are you like in a time

1983.84 --> 1988.48
loop or something in your head what the

1986.24 --> 1991.039
[ __ ] is going on man

1988.48 --> 1992.96
i literally explained it

1991.039 --> 1996.32
i literally explained about

1992.96 --> 1999.44
insignificance in detail

1996.32 --> 2003.36
and then you afterward ask why is it

1999.44 --> 2005.679
insignificant i just told you

2003.36 --> 2007.76
are you like

2005.679 --> 2011.76
zoning out

2007.76 --> 2011.76
are you in some kind of weird time loop

2013.519 --> 2017.48
look what's going on

2025.44 --> 2028.8400000000001
hello eric1111

2030.88 --> 2037.279
cleary logical conclusion

2034.72 --> 2039.6000000000001
so this is sexted oh yeah really is is

2037.279 --> 2042.559
the sextant the natural phenomena is it

2039.6 --> 2042.559
logical conclusion

2042.88 --> 2047.2
i mean

2044.08 --> 2048.879
have any of the flat earthers claimed

2047.2 --> 2051.679
science

2048.879 --> 2053.5989999999997
for the sexton

2051.679 --> 2056.32
because i'm pretty sure it's a

2053.599 --> 2057.599
visual geometric instrument

2056.32 --> 2060.48
right

2057.599 --> 2062.3990000000003
so that's not scientific

2060.48 --> 2064.56
has nothing to do with

2062.399 --> 2068.0789999999997
natural sciences

2064.56 --> 2070.639
simply has to do with geometry

2068.079 --> 2070.639
visually

2072.32 --> 2076.159
jose deleted his chat what

2077.919 --> 2080.919
really

2107.44 --> 2110.44
what

2120.96 --> 2123.2
uh

2128.56 --> 2131.56
huh

2134.88 --> 2138.32
yeah i can't find him anymore

2141.44 --> 2145.839
there's now only one jose jg

2145.92 --> 2150.44
and that's like a musician or something

2162.96 --> 2166.839
uh what a creep

2175.359 --> 2180.64
no more jose jg retirement home for

2177.76 --> 2180.6400000000003
globals yeah

2182.079 --> 2188.6400000000003
jose quit and lied about quitting what

2186.0 --> 2188.64
what do you mean

2193.68 --> 2198.2
you heard you got hacked and banned

2210.8 --> 2215.32
where did i say the word science

2215.76 --> 2219.599
well

2216.96 --> 2222.0
professor filbo if you're gonna

2219.599 --> 2223.6800000000003
make a claim

2222.0 --> 2227.599
about time

2223.68 --> 2229.9199999999996
being actually a palpable thing

2227.599 --> 2233.04
that kind of automatically falls

2229.92 --> 2235.28
in the category of science like because

2233.04 --> 2237.2
you're claiming something to be a

2235.28 --> 2238.0
natural phenomenon

2237.2 --> 2240.24
that

2238.0 --> 2242.72
automatically makes the inquiry

2240.24 --> 2243.9199999999996
scientific

2242.72 --> 2246.0
right

2243.92 --> 2247.119
now you can of course disclaim that

2246.0 --> 2252.28
afterward

2247.119 --> 2252.28
but then you're just blabbering nonsense

2258.48 --> 2262.119
violating youtube

2282.48 --> 2287.839
yeah adam i got the the skype message

2285.44 --> 2290.56
weird though like why

2287.839 --> 2290.56
what did he do

2291.76 --> 2300.88
like did he talk about c or something

2296.16 --> 2300.8799999999997
will be not very typically him but weird

2302.0 --> 2306.079
does anybody know what he was angry

2303.76 --> 2306.079
about

2309.359 --> 2312.359
um

2317.359 --> 2319.68
oh

2324.56 --> 2332.64
okay well that's kind of tragic i mean

2327.359 --> 2332.64
jose did put in a quite a bit of work

2334.079 --> 2336.8
so yeah

2337.119 --> 2342.0
i'm not exactly happy about this

2339.68 --> 2343.2799999999997
it's very yeah

2342.0 --> 2344.24
terrible

2343.28 --> 2347.119
i mean

2344.24 --> 2350.64
yeah his channel was a mess it was a

2347.119 --> 2353.2000000000003
retirement home for the globers but

2350.64 --> 2357.359
still doesn't deserve to be like hacked

2353.2 --> 2357.359
and removed like that

2359.52 --> 2363.52
bitcoins

2361.119 --> 2365.92
whatever

2363.52 --> 2367.7599999999998
if he didn't do it then that's just

2365.92 --> 2369.2000000000003
tragic and weird though like how the

2367.76 --> 2371.599
hell did you get

2369.2 --> 2373.9199999999996
your youtube account act that's

2371.599 --> 2373.92
weird

2417.359 --> 2421.839
okay

2418.56 --> 2421.839
you heard it from rachie

2422.24 --> 2425.839
where did she hear it

2430.24 --> 2432.56
hmm

2433.119 --> 2438.319
okay well look if it's really like a

2435.28 --> 2440.3190000000004
hack or whatever we'll see because jose

2438.319 --> 2441.7599999999998
will probably then just make a new

2440.319 --> 2444.96
channel

2441.76 --> 2444.96
and start over again

2446.4 --> 2450.4
unless he like really wanted to quit

2448.4 --> 2451.599
anyway

2450.4 --> 2454.64
so

2451.599 --> 2454.6400000000003
this just happened

2455.68 --> 2461.48
he flipped his last flop

2458.079 --> 2461.48
okay cleary

2471.04 --> 2474.04
alright

2489.44 --> 2492.44
hmm

2516.96 --> 2521.839
right so i guess that happened

2520.16 --> 2523.68
it kind of took me out of the

2521.839 --> 2527.2
conversation

2523.68 --> 2529.68
then again it was probably just gonna

2527.2 --> 2532.64
be the same thing over and over again

2529.68 --> 2532.64
for quite a while

2533.359 --> 2537.44
so i don't think professor phil bell is

2535.2 --> 2539.9199999999996
ready to admit

2537.44 --> 2543.2400000000002
anything just yet

2539.92 --> 2543.2400000000002
if ever

2574.96 --> 2579.119
when he was on his channel once

2577.28 --> 2580.96
well i've been on this channel plenty of

2579.119 --> 2583.6800000000003
times like

2580.96 --> 2586.319
rarely but sometimes i just

2583.68 --> 2588.16
feel like oh let's let's go in there so

2586.319 --> 2589.92
i've like been on

2588.16 --> 2592.72
a show

2589.92 --> 2595.52
like a dozen times or so

2592.72 --> 2595.52
over the years

2596.4 --> 2602.0
never heard of him

2598.72 --> 2604.56
right well jose jg used to be like even

2602.0 --> 2607.119
on the flat earth debates

2604.56 --> 2609.839
as a flat earther and then suddenly he

2607.119 --> 2609.839
turned around

2610.0 --> 2614.4
and that was even before ranty

2612.96 --> 2616.8
i think

2614.4 --> 2620.44
was it before randy was it after i'm not

2616.8 --> 2620.44
i think it was before

2630.16 --> 2635.92
jim's channel still i don't know

2633.44 --> 2640.68
there's a channel i've never checked out

2635.92 --> 2640.6800000000003
like does he even have a youtube channel

2648.88 --> 2656.1600000000003
oh what randy got did it first okay then

2652.64 --> 2658.7999999999997
yeah i misremembered the order

2656.16 --> 2661.2
of how it transpired all right randy

2658.8 --> 2663.44
went first and then he

2661.2 --> 2664.3999999999996
but it wasn't not it wasn't long after

2663.44 --> 2667.44
each other

2664.4 --> 2667.44
i do remember that

2668.48 --> 2673.359
but it was a very frustrating time

2671.28 --> 2676.0
it was very demoralizing when they did

2673.359 --> 2679.359
it

2676.0 --> 2681.44
it's like genuine treachery and i was

2679.359 --> 2682.56
seriously pissed off about all of it at

2681.44 --> 2684.319
the time

2682.56 --> 2686.0789999999997
i think

2684.319 --> 2688.96
those that have followed like the early

2686.079 --> 2691.28
bird show in the early

2688.96 --> 2693.52
in the early

2691.28 --> 2696.4
part

2693.52 --> 2696.4
do you remember that

2701.28 --> 2705.2000000000003
he

2702.24 --> 2709.1189999999997
before auntie he flip-flopped from bald

2705.2 --> 2709.1189999999997
to flat and then back to ball

2709.76 --> 2714.1600000000003
way before oh so it was

2711.92 --> 2714.16
god

2715.52 --> 2718.88
yeah but that well in that case that

2717.44 --> 2720.56
doesn't make any sense what gadget

2718.88 --> 2723.2000000000003
inspector said if

2720.56 --> 2726.7599999999998
like jose did it first then how could he

2723.2 --> 2726.7599999999998
have done a ranty

2738.64 --> 2742.839
anyway i get it now

2747.44 --> 2754.28
jam panda's channel is full of triggered

2750.0 --> 2754.28
ballers well no surprise there

2774.0 --> 2776.079
yeah

2774.96 --> 2778.4
yes

2776.079 --> 2782.0
yeah qe does call him that

2778.4 --> 2783.28
and to be fair jose

2782.0 --> 2786.0
is

2783.28 --> 2787.8390000000004
mechanically incompetent

2786.0 --> 2789.44
like

2787.839 --> 2791.92
he's

2789.44 --> 2793.92
a bit of a smooth talker

2791.92 --> 2796.16
all that has some skill in that

2793.92 --> 2798.8
department right he knows how to manage

2796.16 --> 2801.44
confuse old people and all that

2798.8 --> 2802.6400000000003
but when it comes to like arguing

2801.44 --> 2805.119
physics

2802.64 --> 2807.04
and mechanisms he's just not very good

2805.119 --> 2809.599
at it and he knows it and he's kind of

2807.04 --> 2809.599
admitted it

2812.72 --> 2817.48
so yeah in a way he like

2818.56 --> 2823.04
he is

2819.839 --> 2827.52
incompetent you can call that [ __ ]

2823.04 --> 2827.52
but it's basically just incompetent

2829.68 --> 2832.3999999999996
and he knows it

2832.8 --> 2837.6800000000003
right at least he's not one of these

2834.48 --> 2839.68
guys that just claims oh i'm a scientist

2837.68 --> 2842.8799999999997
because i know this because i get

2839.68 --> 2845.44
chanted i am now very smart

2842.88 --> 2848.8
no he doesn't do that he at least has

2845.44 --> 2852.44
like a little bit of modesty

2848.8 --> 2852.44
concerning that

2859.839 --> 2862.319
anyway

2870.64 --> 2875.2
what is the temperature

2872.559 --> 2875.2000000000003
let me check

2875.38 --> 2878.84
[Applause]

2879.44 --> 2884.2000000000003
six degrees celsius all right

2898.839 --> 2902.24
hmm whoa

2904.72 --> 2907.2799999999997
what's this

2910.72 --> 2914.8799999999997
all right so no

2912.72 --> 2916.9599999999996
yeah some there's gonna happen some

2914.88 --> 2919.359
temperature swing is probably gonna

2916.96 --> 2921.28
happen according to these predictions

2919.359 --> 2924.0
it's gonna get very cold on friday

2921.28 --> 2924.96
tomorrow and then suddenly shoot back up

2924.0 --> 2927.28
again

2924.96 --> 2928.88
to 11 degrees on sunday

2927.28 --> 2930.4
hmm

2928.88 --> 2932.8
all right

2930.4 --> 2932.8
weird

2934.96 --> 2941.559
baby truther is having awake souls oh my

2938.079 --> 2941.559
god really

2947.76 --> 2952.4
really you think that's going to be a

2949.28 --> 2952.4
good interesting show

2952.8 --> 2956.7200000000003
i mean you know

2954.96 --> 2957.76
the only thing it's just

2956.72 --> 2961.04
this

2957.76 --> 2962.88
and the guy turns into a maniacal savage

2961.04 --> 2966.0
like

2962.88 --> 2968.1600000000003
beyond right-to-hand level triggered

2966.0 --> 2971.52
right you do realize that he turns into

2968.16 --> 2973.68
a complete maniac

2971.52 --> 2976.16
it like

2973.68 --> 2976.16
crazy

2982.16 --> 2987.68
it's weird like i i don't even

2984.16 --> 2991.1189999999997
understand why he would go on gerunds

2987.68 --> 2993.52
like this guy talks down to like so many

2991.119 --> 2993.52
channels

2993.839 --> 2998.48
he literally thinks that everybody in

2996.079 --> 3000.88
the freaking world is an agent except

2998.48 --> 3002.8
him and he thinks like he's the agent of

3000.88 --> 3004.6400000000003
god

3002.8 --> 3008.0
literally

3004.64 --> 3010.0
i i even remember him like sharing how

3008.0 --> 3012.72
he literally talks

3010.0 --> 3015.839
to like an angelic entity

3012.72 --> 3017.7599999999998
and all that just like what the [ __ ]

3015.839 --> 3020.48
and the entity tells them like he's the

3017.76 --> 3022.8
special boy and

3020.48 --> 3023.76
he's like the only one that's not lying

3022.8 --> 3028.0
and

3023.76 --> 3032.3190000000004
is to fight everybody crazy the guy is

3028.0 --> 3037.079
one of the craziest people i've ever met

3032.319 --> 3037.079
on the internet potentially dangerous

3046.16 --> 3051.2799999999997
put on a video saying that they will

3049.119 --> 3053.359
be civil okay so is it going to be like

3051.28 --> 3056.079
a pre-record i take it it's not going to

3053.359 --> 3058.88
be live then it's going to be a recorded

3056.079 --> 3061.119
thing where they can edit [ __ ] out

3058.88 --> 3063.28
right

3061.119 --> 3065.52
because if it's going to be alive

3063.28 --> 3069.079
there's going to be trouble guaranteed i

3065.52 --> 3069.079
guarantee it

3070.0 --> 3074.4
because this guy has just

3072.4 --> 3078.1600000000003
just this has to happen and he just

3074.4 --> 3078.1600000000003
starts rambling like a maniac

3078.96 --> 3083.2
life

3080.8 --> 3086.48
all right good luck jaren

3083.2 --> 3086.48
we'll see what happens

3091.92 --> 3095.28
is david weiss going to debate someone

3093.68 --> 3098.3999999999996
today i don't know he was in chat

3095.28 --> 3102.3590000000004
earlier he popped up say hello

3098.4 --> 3102.359
doesn't happen very often

3122.16 --> 3125.839
he did didn't he

3126.24 --> 3133.24
i mean i called him out

3128.72 --> 3133.24
what now can't find his comment

3135.63 --> 3138.7090000000003
[Music]

3151.92 --> 3155.04
yeah it was there

3156.079 --> 3159.52
like 25 minutes ago

3164.079 --> 3167.8390000000004
yeah yeah that's british time

3173.52 --> 3180.28
ah yeah hello colton

3176.4 --> 3180.28
yeah i'm doing great today

3180.88 --> 3185.28
yeah but i think that everybody or at

3183.359 --> 3190.24
least everybody should know about me

3185.28 --> 3192.079
that yeah sometimes arwyn gets sick

3190.24 --> 3195.04
and that like

3192.079 --> 3197.44
seems like oh my god he's gonna blow it

3195.04 --> 3199.7599999999998
like hey and for some people

3197.44 --> 3202.0
i don't i'm not surprised because most

3199.76 --> 3205.3590000000004
people that i have bumped into

3202.0 --> 3206.839
that have similar condition patterns

3205.359 --> 3210.88
that i have

3206.839 --> 3214.16
yeah when they flip they go [ __ ]

3210.88 --> 3215.2000000000003
insane and like like up to violent

3214.16 --> 3216.3999999999996
levels

3215.2 --> 3219.04
i don't

3216.4 --> 3222.0
i just have like this short moment

3219.04 --> 3223.2799999999997
like a panic internal weird rewiring

3222.0 --> 3225.839
panic

3223.28 --> 3227.76
but i know how to control it like i know

3225.839 --> 3230.96
how to control it

3227.76 --> 3234.079
yeah that's rare that's extremely rare i

3230.96 --> 3235.76
have never met another soul

3234.079 --> 3237.92
that can do that

3235.76 --> 3240.0
in my life

3237.92 --> 3242.319
not single one

3240.0 --> 3243.92
not a single person that has the same

3242.319 --> 3245.2
kind of

3243.92 --> 3248.0
mechanisms

3245.2 --> 3248.8799999999997
internal wiring over sensitivity and

3248.0 --> 3251.839
like

3248.88 --> 3251.839
paranoia

3252.96 --> 3256.079
like

3253.839 --> 3258.319
borderline where just things become

3256.079 --> 3260.6400000000003
weird

3258.319 --> 3262.4
i've never met anybody else that can

3260.64 --> 3263.7599999999998
literally just

3262.4 --> 3265.839
recover

3263.76 --> 3266.88
fully

3265.839 --> 3269.839
quickly

3266.88 --> 3269.839
never met a soul

3273.359 --> 3278.72
everybody that's like that usually when

3275.599 --> 3282.96
they flip it's trouble and then they can

3278.72 --> 3285.4399999999996
like go be insane and super anti-social

3282.96 --> 3288.559
for months

3285.44 --> 3288.559
or permanently

3288.799 --> 3293.04
but never just like

3290.559 --> 3295.92
like i do yeah i get sick

3293.04 --> 3299.7599999999998
and maybe my body gets like really sick

3295.92 --> 3302.319
from all the stress for like a week max

3299.76 --> 3304.3190000000004
usually it's just one or two days

3302.319 --> 3306.96
and i go through turmoil and then i just

3304.319 --> 3309.119
completely restore

3306.96 --> 3310.799
i don't know anybody else

3309.119 --> 3314.48
that can do it like that

3310.799 --> 3316.4
not a single person ever have i met that

3314.48 --> 3318.2400000000002
can do that

3316.4 --> 3322.559
my entire life

3318.24 --> 3325.1189999999997
and that includes my own my own mother

3322.559 --> 3329.3190000000004
she couldn't do that and she had that's

3325.119 --> 3329.319
where i inherited it from

3336.079 --> 3341.28
we all have our ups and downs made yeah

3338.799 --> 3343.28
of course

3341.28 --> 3345.6800000000003
people do

3343.28 --> 3348.88
but yeah most people that i've seen that

3345.68 --> 3351.44
have the level of sensitivity that i do

3348.88 --> 3352.2400000000002
and they're like really

3351.44 --> 3354.4
like

3352.24 --> 3357.7599999999998
change their inner wiring and their

3354.4 --> 3360.319
sensations and even how they see things

3357.76 --> 3362.6400000000003
because of like sudden condition

3360.319 --> 3365.599
internal wiring switch

3362.64 --> 3367.2
all those people go crazy when that

3365.599 --> 3369.599
happens

3367.2 --> 3370.64
they like really lose control they don't

3369.599 --> 3373.3590000000004
have

3370.64 --> 3376.64
like this other layer on top of it a

3373.359 --> 3379.119
mental layer that is unfazed

3376.64 --> 3382.0789999999997
that while the rewiring goes on can

3379.119 --> 3384.6400000000003
still keep consistent control so that it

3382.079 --> 3388.28
doesn't go out of hand

3384.64 --> 3388.2799999999997
i don't know anybody

3391.28 --> 3397.44
i mean they're probably out there but

3393.52 --> 3399.44
those people never even show a hint

3397.44 --> 3400.88
that they have the condition

3399.44 --> 3403.2000000000003
at all

3400.88 --> 3406.1600000000003
they keep it as strict secret because

3403.2 --> 3408.3999999999996
hey if other people know about it

3406.16 --> 3412.5589999999997
then they might abuse it because when

3408.4 --> 3415.76
you're vulnerable like that you are

3412.559 --> 3417.44
devils come forth in other people

3415.76 --> 3420.559
that are like

3417.44 --> 3420.559
now i'm gonna get you

3420.72 --> 3424.9599999999996
and that would even be people that

3422.48 --> 3426.64
normally like really like you

3424.96 --> 3428.64
it happens

3426.64 --> 3433.1189999999997
it literally happens and that's why most

3428.64 --> 3436.96
people keep it a complete secret i don't

3433.119 --> 3437.839
because i have a special ability

3436.96 --> 3439.359
i've

3437.839 --> 3442.319
had naturally

3439.359 --> 3445.04
but i've developed it strictly

3442.319 --> 3447.2
as a discipline starting extremely young

3445.04 --> 3449.839
preteen

3447.2 --> 3450.72
figuring out

3449.839 --> 3453.2
how

3450.72 --> 3455.4399999999996
while the internal workings are insane

3453.2 --> 3457.52
and like even like

3455.44 --> 3460.48
really dark sometimes where i literally

3457.52 --> 3462.24
just start seeing torture and [ __ ] that

3460.48 --> 3464.2400000000002
i would still

3462.24 --> 3466.9599999999996
mentally keep it level and i would just

3464.24 --> 3468.24
be like okay yeah i'm

3466.96 --> 3470.7200000000003
everything that comes out of me is

3468.24 --> 3472.72
overkill now but it's not gonna take

3470.72 --> 3475.04
control

3472.72 --> 3476.72
i'm not gonna let it literally destroy

3475.04 --> 3479.44
my situation

3476.72 --> 3481.5989999999997
i will just let it ride out

3479.44 --> 3486.28
and then pick back up where i left off

3481.599 --> 3486.28
before that stop before that started

3493.92 --> 3496.96
right

3494.72 --> 3498.64
and yeah everybody gets a little bit of

3496.96 --> 3500.7200000000003
a crisis

3498.64 --> 3504.16
they lose a bit of confidence sometimes

3500.72 --> 3507.839
yeah most people don't start to get like

3504.16 --> 3507.839
hallucinations when that happens

3508.64 --> 3515.04
it's just regular stress to them

3512.559 --> 3518.2400000000002
when you're really sensitive yeah

3515.04 --> 3520.799
it it can absolutely like get really

3518.24 --> 3520.799
surreal

3522.24 --> 3525.52
pressure valve

3523.839 --> 3526.64
right

3525.52 --> 3528.799
but

3526.64 --> 3532.319
you see pressure valve indeed that's a

3528.799 --> 3534.24
really good thing to draw in there

3532.319 --> 3536.0
as a metaphor

3534.24 --> 3538.8799999999997
because i

3536.0 --> 3542.52
function at high pressure that's my

3538.88 --> 3542.52
standard functioning

3544.72 --> 3551.2
right and this is partially also that

3547.52 --> 3553.44
why some people can't really

3551.2 --> 3555.5989999999997
deal with me

3553.44 --> 3558.48
because that pressure immediately rubs

3555.599 --> 3561.92
off it's like i basically by just

3558.48 --> 3564.559
existing and communicating with people

3561.92 --> 3566.48
automatically force them to up their

3564.559 --> 3568.88
internal pressure to take everything

3566.48 --> 3572.559
just one step more serious

3568.88 --> 3575.52
without turning into a fight

3572.559 --> 3578.4
because that's the level of pressure

3575.52 --> 3580.4
that i function under that's my default

3578.4 --> 3582.96
it's default and like

3580.4 --> 3585.359
eternal default

3582.96 --> 3590.079
there is no other level for me the level

3585.359 --> 3590.0789999999997
down is literal depression for me

3591.44 --> 3597.28
this is my default level and some people

3594.64 --> 3599.359
will bump into me and be like

3597.28 --> 3601.8390000000004
there's something about this guy i don't

3599.359 --> 3604.0
like it

3601.839 --> 3605.599
he's he's really different but i don't

3604.0 --> 3610.24
like it and other people will be like

3605.599 --> 3610.2400000000002
wow finally somebody that's different

3610.88 --> 3613.88
right

3616.799 --> 3620.24
anybody still following me

3622.24 --> 3627.799
maybe he's like drowning a little bit

3624.16 --> 3627.799
too deep in metaphor

3628.24 --> 3631.24
what

3644.96 --> 3650.2400000000002
but it's true i function on that higher

3647.28 --> 3652.1600000000003
level and i do not accept

3650.24 --> 3655.04
taking a step back i literally don't

3652.16 --> 3658.0
accept it i withdraw myself

3655.04 --> 3660.96
either i have high level high pressure

3658.0 --> 3662.799
functioning interaction or i just don't

3660.96 --> 3664.96
get involved

3662.799 --> 3668.16
and unfortunately out there in the world

3664.96 --> 3669.92
that means 98 of the time i don't get

3668.16 --> 3671.68
involved and just see people just

3669.92 --> 3673.52
blabbering superficially and i'm like

3671.68 --> 3677.3999999999996
yeah

3673.52 --> 3677.4
that's the way they are

3689.839 --> 3693.92
right and i guess that for flat earthers

3692.0 --> 3695.119
i think that probably quite a few flat

3693.92 --> 3696.839
earthers

3695.119 --> 3699.599
out there

3696.839 --> 3701.7599999999998
also function on slightly higher

3699.599 --> 3704.4
pressure levels because yeah because

3701.76 --> 3706.88
otherwise it becomes really hard to even

3704.4 --> 3709.04
like take a position within flat earth

3706.88 --> 3709.92
and then face the rest of humanity with

3709.04 --> 3713.119
that

3709.92 --> 3715.44
you have to be able to function on some

3713.119 --> 3717.76
higher pressure level

3715.44 --> 3719.52
right and that's also why a lot of

3717.76 --> 3721.039
people when they get confronted with it

3719.52 --> 3723.599
are like

3721.039 --> 3724.559
i'm not gonna go there literally my life

3723.599 --> 3726.2400000000002
is gonna

3724.559 --> 3728.48
suddenly turned into like a pressure

3726.24 --> 3730.4799999999996
cooker situation and that's why they say

3728.48 --> 3732.079
yeah no thanks i just like oh it could

3730.48 --> 3733.92
be but

3732.079 --> 3736.319
it's not my thing

3733.92 --> 3739.28
that's the reason why because of that

3736.319 --> 3740.4
pressure so yeah people that are like

3739.28 --> 3742.4
flat earth

3740.4 --> 3744.0
[ __ ] yeah

3742.4 --> 3746.079
those are kind of people that do

3744.0 --> 3748.64
function on that higher pressure level

3746.079 --> 3749.92
as well so they don't see any objections

3748.64 --> 3753.2
i think a lot of these people would

3749.92 --> 3757.2000000000003
probably be classified as

3753.2 --> 3757.2
somewhere in the direction of hdhd

3757.28 --> 3760.96
hyperactiveness

3759.599 --> 3762.6400000000003
because in a way it is kind of

3760.96 --> 3764.559
hyperactiveness the problem though is

3762.64 --> 3766.48
that with most people again

3764.559 --> 3769.3590000000004
that's why i say i'm kind of unique most

3766.48 --> 3772.64
people that do have that

3769.359 --> 3774.0
they do go a bit crazy that's almost

3772.64 --> 3776.72
normal

3774.0 --> 3778.64
i don't because i have the extra layer

3776.72 --> 3781.4399999999996
on top

3778.64 --> 3784.319
to prevent that craziness from like

3781.44 --> 3784.319
getting a grip

3786.64 --> 3792.48
like with me at best it expresses in

3789.76 --> 3795.76
just expression i get literally

3792.48 --> 3797.2
just start getting weird

3795.76 --> 3799.119
mimetic

3797.2 --> 3800.64
silly acting

3799.119 --> 3802.4
in a bit of a

3800.64 --> 3804.48
manic way

3802.4 --> 3807.28
that's like the worst that can come out

3804.48 --> 3809.28
of it for me

3807.28 --> 3810.4
but most of the time i just i'm just

3809.28 --> 3813.76
stable

3810.4 --> 3813.76
even with all that pressure

3819.28 --> 3824.96
yeah i guess i'm not gonna cover that

3822.079 --> 3828.7200000000003
that's strike material okay you know it

3824.96 --> 3829.599
is you know it is you should know it is

3828.72 --> 3832.799
oh

3829.599 --> 3835.2000000000003
something is happening out there right

3832.799 --> 3838.559
now involving

3835.2 --> 3840.799
politics new world order stuff oh the

3838.559 --> 3842.3190000000004
media is not covering well guess what's

3840.799 --> 3844.64
going to happen

3842.319 --> 3846.5589999999997
when you make it a main item

3844.64 --> 3848.319
guess what happens

3846.559 --> 3850.1600000000003
you're going to get a strike that's how

3848.319 --> 3853.0389999999998
it works

3850.16 --> 3855.839
that's how it works

3853.039 --> 3855.8390000000004
it's a trap

3856.16 --> 3859.68
they're always traps

3860.4 --> 3865.039
that's why i'm not a guy that's just

3862.48 --> 3866.72
super you're like oh look this just

3865.039 --> 3868.6400000000003
happened oh

3866.72 --> 3871.1189999999997
bill millions of people are going to be

3868.64 --> 3874.319
interested in it i am going to do my

3871.119 --> 3878.48
show about it and as loud as possible

3874.319 --> 3882.5589999999997
yeah that's how you get a strike

3878.48 --> 3885.359
that's how you get a strike

3882.559 --> 3887.599
because it's now it's now

3885.359 --> 3889.68
it's now in the attention and that means

3887.599 --> 3890.4
it's now going to be censored

3889.68 --> 3892.0
now

3890.4 --> 3894.0
when this is over i don't know how long

3892.0 --> 3895.599
it's going to take let's say a few

3894.0 --> 3898.88
months after if you're then going to

3895.599 --> 3901.44
discuss it bring it up

3898.88 --> 3904.319
they're not going to bother you

3901.44 --> 3905.839
they literally won't care anymore it's

3904.319 --> 3906.839
only

3905.839 --> 3908.4
hype

3906.839 --> 3909.68
prevention

3908.4 --> 3911.44
the strikes

3909.68 --> 3913.7599999999998
because some media situation is

3911.44 --> 3916.64
currently going up on

3913.76 --> 3920.0
is hype prevention

3916.64 --> 3923.5989999999997
now if you want to be an ass and say but

3920.0 --> 3924.799
i want the hype i have a right

3923.599 --> 3927.28
to

3924.799 --> 3929.7599999999998
wild growth of attention

3927.28 --> 3932.0
because i'm a special boy i deserve all

3929.76 --> 3933.8390000000004
that attention i want it now yeah you're

3932.0 --> 3936.48
gonna get a [ __ ] strike what did you

3933.839 --> 3939.2
expect that's what happens

3936.48 --> 3940.72
that's why you shouldn't do that right

3939.2 --> 3943.2799999999997
in the middle

3940.72 --> 3946.319
oh benjamin describes it as the

3943.28 --> 3948.88
when a spell is ongoing

3946.319 --> 3950.4
you don't mess with it you don't use

3948.88 --> 3952.799
hype

3950.4 --> 3955.44
to basically break that there will come

3952.799 --> 3956.839
after you per default systematically

3955.44 --> 3959.599
automated

3956.839 --> 3961.2
automated there won't even be a person

3959.599 --> 3963.28
actually looking

3961.2 --> 3964.96
and deciding to do that it's going to be

3963.28 --> 3966.88
automated

3964.96 --> 3968.2400000000002
you see because when the spell is

3966.88 --> 3971.2000000000003
ongoing

3968.24 --> 3973.5989999999997
don't get involved you'll get a strike

3971.2 --> 3976.0789999999997
now if it's a couple of months after it

3973.599 --> 3980.6400000000003
doesn't matter anymore you can literally

3976.079 --> 3983.039
say anything you want about it anything

3980.64 --> 3985.52
they want care

3983.039 --> 3989.119
it's only when the spell

3985.52 --> 3992.319
is happening when media is obviously not

3989.119 --> 3995.92
covering something in the moment when

3992.319 --> 3997.599
you go all hype out about it that's when

3995.92 --> 3999.039
you get a strike

3997.599 --> 4001.92
get this right

3999.039 --> 4004.48
see it know what you're doing

4001.92 --> 4005.6800000000003
it's no use saying it's evil he's evil

4004.48 --> 4007.52
yet

4005.68 --> 4009.1189999999997
so what

4007.52 --> 4010.799
so what

4009.119 --> 4012.079
it's the way it is

4010.799 --> 4015.0389999999998
know it

4012.079 --> 4017.039
don't struggle with it you're gonna lose

4015.039 --> 4019.119
there's probably not even a person

4017.039 --> 4021.2000000000003
you're struggling with it's just the way

4019.119 --> 4023.92
it's now works that's how it's arranged

4021.2 --> 4025.2799999999997
that's how it happens have some freaking

4023.92 --> 4027.92
patience

4025.28 --> 4030.559
have some freaking patience i mean

4027.92 --> 4031.839
let's just say oh this really hyped up

4030.559 --> 4035.28
movie

4031.839 --> 4037.359
is gonna come in theaters and that

4035.28 --> 4039.119
just imagine like it's five years ago

4037.359 --> 4042.0
movies like super hyped it's coming in

4039.119 --> 4045.6800000000003
theater oh you must be at the premiere

4042.0 --> 4047.76
you must you must see it the first time

4045.68 --> 4050.24
i'm a special boy i have to see it right

4047.76 --> 4051.3590000000004
now yo guess what you're gonna pay a big

4050.24 --> 4052.9599999999996
price

4051.359 --> 4054.5589999999997
you're gonna be

4052.96 --> 4057.92
struggling

4054.559 --> 4059.8390000000004
to get that premier seat because all the

4057.92 --> 4061.44
stars are probably gonna be there etc

4059.839 --> 4062.48
right right

4061.44 --> 4066.319
or

4062.48 --> 4067.52
you could just wait a couple of months

4066.319 --> 4069.7599999999998
or year

4067.52 --> 4071.2
and then download it for free and nobody

4069.76 --> 4073.92
gives a [ __ ]

4071.2 --> 4076.3999999999996
it's the same effect

4073.92 --> 4081.039
it's the same effect

4076.4 --> 4081.039
understand it understand what it is

4082.24 --> 4087.2799999999997
right when the spell is being cast and

4084.799 --> 4090.72
all the attention is drawn in

4087.28 --> 4093.119
don't [ __ ] with it they'll [ __ ] with you

4090.72 --> 4095.4399999999996
if you really want to talk about it and

4093.119 --> 4098.400000000001
it's not just i want that hype i'm the

4095.44 --> 4100.2390000000005
special i want to hijack the attention

4098.4 --> 4102.48
yeah if it's about that you're going to

4100.239 --> 4104.08
get a strike if you just want to cover

4102.48 --> 4106.159
something because you're actually

4104.08 --> 4108.239
interested in the subject

4106.159 --> 4111.44
just wait a bit

4108.239 --> 4111.44
just wait a bit

4113.12 --> 4116.5199999999995
that's it

4122.799 --> 4127.359
it's literally on the front page of the

4124.48 --> 4127.3589999999995
bbc oh right

4130.56 --> 4136.56
still no bait oh well you weren't there

4134.0 --> 4139.44
flat or lost [ __ ] i'm going to ban you

4136.56 --> 4141.92
by default you're just a stupid troll

4139.44 --> 4144.879999999999
yeah yeah we literally have this show

4141.92 --> 4147.6
talked about flat earth what time

4144.88 --> 4150.719
dilation for example

4147.6 --> 4153.279
so it's all [ __ ] i constantly talk

4150.719 --> 4155.12
about flat earth sometimes there's a day

4153.279 --> 4157.759
where i literally don't mention it a

4155.12 --> 4161.839
single time

4157.759 --> 4161.839
except for the part of the title

4162.4 --> 4166.48
but yeah i do still talk about it

4167.44 --> 4170.0
right

4168.64 --> 4172.88
remember the show

4170.0 --> 4175.6
angle oh sextant supremacy

4172.88 --> 4178.92
that's very much flat earth related very

4175.6 --> 4178.92
much so

4188.799 --> 4192.96
you should be a shrink i am a shrink

4194.0 --> 4198.0
well layman

4195.679 --> 4201.4400000000005
that is gadget inspector yeah

4198.0 --> 4204.8
psychology spirit mechanics

4201.44 --> 4207.28
sociology social engineering those are

4204.8 --> 4209.04
my personal

4207.28 --> 4212.0
interests

4209.04 --> 4212.0
my entire life

4213.76 --> 4218.719
but i'm not gonna like get an official

4216.239 --> 4220.879999999999
job or something with that

4218.719 --> 4223.36
because those people

4220.88 --> 4225.36
like that's not that doesn't actually

4223.36 --> 4227.679
accomplish anything

4225.36 --> 4229.5199999999995
those people just get stuck

4227.679 --> 4231.76
with like people that are just

4229.52 --> 4232.88
completely out of control can never be

4231.76 --> 4235.679
fixed

4232.88 --> 4238.400000000001
and they most psychologists just end up

4235.679 --> 4240.8
basically just

4238.4 --> 4242.159
being the guy to ramble to

4240.8 --> 4243.360000000001
and they just

4242.159 --> 4246.0
like oh

4243.36 --> 4247.759999999999
if i can get him to like talk 200 hours

4246.0 --> 4248.8
to me i can get a lot of money out of

4247.76 --> 4250.159000000001
that

4248.8 --> 4252.2390000000005
right

4250.159 --> 4255.36
i don't want that at all

4252.239 --> 4259.44
i want to fix problems call me arrogant

4255.36 --> 4261.599999999999
i just want to fix it immediately

4259.44 --> 4262.879999999999
psychologists

4261.6 --> 4265.6
don't do that

4262.88 --> 4269.04
they just they want money they want to

4265.6 --> 4270.8
first ensure that you find the need to

4269.04 --> 4273.84
blabber on

4270.8 --> 4273.84
about it forever

4275.76 --> 4280.96
so that it costs extra time

4278.56 --> 4282.2390000000005
and they get extra money i don't want

4280.96 --> 4286.28
that

4282.239 --> 4286.28
i never want that

4286.48 --> 4290.239
i just want to use my insight

4288.8 --> 4293.12
to just

4290.239 --> 4297.08
help people out instantly

4293.12 --> 4297.08
if they're ready for it

4306.4 --> 4310.639999999999
okay one for the unit what

4312.48 --> 4317.5199999999995
okay

4315.28 --> 4319.679
well look look the australian situation

4317.52 --> 4321.84
is like seriously getting out of hand

4319.679 --> 4325.4800000000005
seriously that

4321.84 --> 4325.4800000000005
so yeah

4343.28 --> 4348.159
criminal forensic psychologist

4345.679 --> 4350.0
yeah well

4348.159 --> 4353.0
i'm not interested in criminal

4350.0 --> 4353.0
psychology

4360.32 --> 4367.599999999999
my strategy would not match

4363.92 --> 4367.6
current societal strategy

4368.64 --> 4372.0
i would be very

4370.48 --> 4374.159
very punishing

4372.0 --> 4376.32
to actual criminals that i'll never get

4374.159 --> 4378.159
out of that mindset i'm just gonna be

4376.32 --> 4382.759999999999
like yeah

4378.159 --> 4382.759999999999
get it under control or die

4384.56 --> 4388.96
i'm not very merciful to criminals

4390.0 --> 4394.96
like somebody that literally does

4392.32 --> 4399.12
repeated offenses

4394.96 --> 4400.96
and is like acting unrepented about it

4399.12 --> 4404.08
that's

4400.96 --> 4404.08
i do not have

4406.48 --> 4411.959999999999
anything constructive

4408.719 --> 4411.96
for that

4417.12 --> 4420.8
all right

4419.44 --> 4422.879999999999
because yeah

4420.8 --> 4425.28
what are you going to do just manipulate

4422.88 --> 4427.12
them the rest of their life to basically

4425.28 --> 4429.28
trick them not to

4427.12 --> 4430.64
be harmful

4429.28 --> 4433.12
well that's all that's going to be on

4430.64 --> 4433.12
their mind

4433.6 --> 4436.719
i'm like no

4434.88 --> 4440.0
why would you keep people with those

4436.719 --> 4441.44
nightmares alive

4440.0 --> 4444.48
if they're going to be criminals and

4441.44 --> 4444.48
they're not going to stop

4449.84 --> 4455.84
i'm sorry this is just one there's only

4452.48 --> 4455.839999999999
one solution in my book

4457.44 --> 4461.759999999999
and that's execution

4459.92 --> 4465.4400000000005
right so yeah that's not gonna make me

4461.76 --> 4468.56
very popular in societal circles

4465.44 --> 4470.5599999999995
i'm just not very merciful against like

4468.56 --> 4472.2390000000005
like chronic criminals and i don't mean

4470.56 --> 4473.679
like

4472.239 --> 4475.919999999999
rebels

4473.679 --> 4477.52
that like

4475.92 --> 4479.679
if you have to like

4477.52 --> 4482.0
it's it's all such a sliding skill it's

4479.679 --> 4483.52
just if you start normalizing any form

4482.0 --> 4486.56
of criminality

4483.52 --> 4488.159000000001
for any reason it will rub off on you

4486.56 --> 4491.1990000000005
and before you know

4488.159 --> 4494.0
it's normalized and then you never

4491.199 --> 4497.04
get out of it

4494.0 --> 4499.52
you will simply lose the natural

4497.04 --> 4503.12
internal obstacles to stop it in the

4499.52 --> 4506.080000000001
future and that's the problem

4503.12 --> 4508.5599999999995
just the natural protections wear off

4506.08 --> 4511.6
when you decide

4508.56 --> 4514.0
when you decide to normalize criminal

4511.6 --> 4516.64
actions for yourself

4514.0 --> 4518.88
and it's extremely difficult even with

4516.64 --> 4521.4400000000005
minor little things

4518.88 --> 4524.08
to get rid of it

4521.44 --> 4526.799999999999
so if you're then like a criminal

4524.08 --> 4528.5599999999995
impulsive murderer there is no salvation

4526.8 --> 4531.04
there is no

4528.56 --> 4534.4400000000005
cell patient ever

4531.04 --> 4534.44
only death

4540.719 --> 4544.159
right you can't cure somebody who has no

4542.32 --> 4546.799999999999
empathy that's another way of saying it

4544.159 --> 4549.839999999999
right but no i don't like

4546.8 --> 4551.679
criminal psychologists

4549.84 --> 4554.159000000001
i mean

4551.679 --> 4556.4
if it would be like oh let's try to

4554.159 --> 4558.639999999999
figure out what this criminal whose

4556.4 --> 4559.36
elusive is gonna do in order to catch

4558.64 --> 4560.719
him

4559.36 --> 4563.04
maybe

4560.719 --> 4565.76
maybe i'd think along i wouldn't want to

4563.04 --> 4567.12
be doing that all day long just because

4565.76 --> 4570.400000000001
what's gonna happen

4567.12 --> 4571.5199999999995
i'm gonna try to freaking simulate in my

4570.4 --> 4573.5199999999995
mind

4571.52 --> 4576.64
those criminals and their mindset

4573.52 --> 4578.080000000001
remember how i talked about that [ __ ]

4576.64 --> 4580.4800000000005
rubbing off

4578.08 --> 4582.96
i don't want that [ __ ] rubbing off i

4580.48 --> 4585.839999999999
don't want to try to imagine all day

4582.96 --> 4588.4
long uh what it is like to be a psych a

4585.84 --> 4590.08
psychotic killer or something i don't

4588.4 --> 4594.719
want that

4590.08 --> 4596.719
it's gonna make my life a living hell

4594.719 --> 4598.08
i don't want that

4596.719 --> 4600.56
i want to

4598.08 --> 4604.64
figure out

4600.56 --> 4608.6
how to help people that can be helped

4604.64 --> 4608.6
i want to fix things

4613.84 --> 4617.52
hmm

4615.44 --> 4621.239
all right i'm gonna take a two minute

4617.52 --> 4621.2390000000005
break i'll be right back

4705.28 --> 4708.28
you

4721.04 --> 4726.8
they are more criminal profile look well

4724.08 --> 4728.32
look logical conclusion

4726.8 --> 4730.88
i mean

4728.32 --> 4733.88
i'd be interested

4730.88 --> 4733.88
perhaps

4734.0 --> 4737.76
but

4734.8 --> 4739.12
i highly doubted i would ever maneuver

4737.76 --> 4741.360000000001
to a point

4739.12 --> 4743.5199999999995
where i'd be professional where i would

4741.36 --> 4744.799999999999
actually be paid for to do anything like

4743.52 --> 4747.52
that

4744.8 --> 4750.320000000001
but yeah maybe learning a little

4747.52 --> 4752.56
i mean i've done that in the past

4750.32 --> 4754.639999999999
like i've approached a whole bunch of

4752.56 --> 4758.719
people

4754.64 --> 4762.400000000001
and then like what just wanted to learn

4758.719 --> 4764.32
right i've even did that with

4762.4 --> 4766.5599999999995
people

4764.32 --> 4768.48
that are very shady

4766.56 --> 4770.400000000001
but that's like way in the past like

4768.48 --> 4772.48
really way in the past i would just be

4770.4 --> 4775.28
the guy to walk up to them and then just

4772.48 --> 4778.32
on their level like i want to know why

4775.28 --> 4781.679
and how you do this

4778.32 --> 4785.28
because i i genuinely didn't understand

4781.679 --> 4789.1990000000005
like why would people go there

4785.28 --> 4792.08
what makes them do that i was doing my

4789.199 --> 4794.08
personal human studies and that went

4792.08 --> 4796.64
quite far sometimes because i would get

4794.08 --> 4799.6
drugged along with people

4796.64 --> 4799.6
that are dangerous

4803.679 --> 4809.679
that that's as far as yeah

4806.159 --> 4809.679
i'm not gonna say more about it

4811.12 --> 4818.04
but yeah i've seen things that are like

4815.04 --> 4818.04
haunting

4820.8 --> 4826.2390000000005
but it was all

4822.32 --> 4827.04
just to try and understand like why

4826.239 --> 4829.44
why

4827.04 --> 4831.04
are you in this position why do you do

4829.44 --> 4833.678999999999
it

4831.04 --> 4835.28
what is the price that like

4833.679 --> 4837.04
of course you're going to go for it

4835.28 --> 4839.599999999999
whatever you want to win

4837.04 --> 4842.4
and what in your endeavor but

4839.6 --> 4844.159000000001
how do like do you still feel the

4842.4 --> 4846.08
punishment

4844.159 --> 4848.4
right is it still punishing do you

4846.08 --> 4850.32
realize the long-term concept like all

4848.4 --> 4852.32
the i was interested in the

4850.32 --> 4855.04
consciousness

4852.32 --> 4857.92
and what it did to you to kind of like

4855.04 --> 4857.92
be a criminal

4858.32 --> 4863.599999999999
when you were still in control when

4860.4 --> 4863.599999999999
you're not like in jail

4864.96 --> 4869.92
creepy stuff

4867.12 --> 4873.44
so yeah i've done

4869.92 --> 4876.08
some investigation

4873.44 --> 4879.759999999999
but yeah never liked professionally it

4876.08 --> 4879.76
was just like this crazy guy

4881.04 --> 4885.6
i mean back in the day i think probably

4883.679 --> 4887.6
some people thought i was a genuine

4885.6 --> 4889.6
psychopath

4887.6 --> 4891.76
because i seemed

4889.6 --> 4895.679
like i didn't care

4891.76 --> 4897.1990000000005
but it did i just kept it a very very

4895.679 --> 4899.52
strict secret

4897.199 --> 4901.919999999999
because i was i knew like

4899.52 --> 4903.84
if you're gonna do this you can't show

4901.92 --> 4908.04
what you're feeling you can't do it like

4903.84 --> 4908.04
under the most extreme circumstances

4917.04 --> 4920.239
ah crazy

4922.0 --> 4927.28
but yeah i'm not doing that anymore

4925.199 --> 4930.28
i've seen enough

4927.28 --> 4930.28
literally

4932.48 --> 4936.4
you should all know by now the world is

4934.48 --> 4940.159
run my peter files

4936.4 --> 4942.0
just don't go there again please

4940.159 --> 4945.44
it is kind of hilarious that it's now

4942.0 --> 4948.96
just called peter files

4945.44 --> 4951.759999999999
right but yeah i blocked the word

4948.96 --> 4953.92
in my chat for a reason because i just

4951.76 --> 4955.679
don't want people to start bringing that

4953.92 --> 4959.4
up again right i don't want to start

4955.679 --> 4959.4
digging through nightmares

4966.88 --> 4973.32
the gadgets what serial killers

4970.32 --> 4973.32
seriously

4976.32 --> 4979.199
what

4977.36 --> 4982.0
where

4979.199 --> 4984.5599999999995
it's a myth most of that is a myth

4982.0 --> 4986.56
it's a movie-created myth

4984.56 --> 4989.04
that they even exist

4986.56 --> 4989.04
like that

4989.36 --> 4994.239
i don't believe it

4990.8 --> 4997.28
i mean there's probably a couple

4994.239 --> 4998.32
but that's so rare especially in just

4997.28 --> 5002.48
regular

4998.32 --> 5002.48
western society that's so rare

5007.199 --> 5011.5199999999995
right and by the way yeah

5009.44 --> 5013.599999999999
profile you

5011.52 --> 5014.8
you do realize we live in the internet

5013.6 --> 5018.0
age right

5014.8 --> 5019.1990000000005
with like devices everywhere you think

5018.0 --> 5021.76
that

5019.199 --> 5021.759999999999
you could just

5021.84 --> 5026.8
you're it's gonna be found out it's

5024.56 --> 5030.159000000001
gonna be registered one way or the other

5026.8 --> 5033.76
like it's not like oh we really have to

5030.159 --> 5035.839999999999
figure out all the the movements

5033.76 --> 5038.0
this alleged serial killer is going to

5035.84 --> 5040.08
make when we don't even know who we're

5038.0 --> 5042.56
dealing with potentially we don't have a

5040.08 --> 5044.159
suspect yet and then reconstruct how

5042.56 --> 5045.280000000001
he's gonna

5044.159 --> 5047.92
or

5045.28 --> 5049.5199999999995
you just tap into the wide web

5047.92 --> 5051.36
electronics

5049.52 --> 5053.92
and then

5051.36 --> 5056.799999999999
start to like detect

5053.92 --> 5059.76
aberrational behavior patterns

5056.8 --> 5061.360000000001
and then find somebody like that

5059.76 --> 5063.92
right

5061.36 --> 5066.88
because this is not the 80s and the 90s

5063.92 --> 5066.88
anymore people

5066.96 --> 5072.4
like you cannot

5068.88 --> 5074.96
even stay that off the radar now it's

5072.4 --> 5076.239
just impossible

5074.96 --> 5078.159
unless you're like

5076.239 --> 5080.0
away from civilization in the middle of

5078.159 --> 5084.5199999999995
the forest and

5080.0 --> 5084.52
no electronics right

5088.8 --> 5090.719
but

5089.84 --> 5092.400000000001
still

5090.719 --> 5094.0
there should be other

5092.4 --> 5096.48
useful things you could do with

5094.0 --> 5097.76
psychology and

5096.48 --> 5100.0
anyway

5097.76 --> 5103.04
but just don't think that what you're

5100.0 --> 5104.32
seeing in movies and series of uh

5103.04 --> 5106.88
creamies

5104.32 --> 5108.48
crime series that that is actually

5106.88 --> 5109.6
realistic

5108.48 --> 5110.799999999999
it isn't

5109.6 --> 5112.4800000000005
at all

5110.8 --> 5115.28
like at all

5112.48 --> 5115.28
nothing like that

5120.56 --> 5124.080000000001
that's right slow mo and buggy

5124.32 --> 5129.84
especially charles manson it's just nuts

5126.8 --> 5133.4800000000005
the guys just like pretty obviously a

5129.84 --> 5133.4800000000005
cia project

5140.4 --> 5144.159
it's yeah

5142.4 --> 5146.0
it's

5144.159 --> 5147.36
right

5146.0 --> 5150.639
the people

5147.36 --> 5154.799999999999
that are alleged real serial killers

5150.639 --> 5157.76
they already have all the data on them

5154.8 --> 5159.76
even back then

5157.76 --> 5162.8
why do you think they know everything

5159.76 --> 5165.679
about it why is it all like recorded

5162.8 --> 5169.1990000000005
because they all knew it

5165.679 --> 5172.32
they all knew it was happening

5169.199 --> 5173.44
it was all on the radar they didn't have

5172.32 --> 5175.759999999999
to

5173.44 --> 5178.0
like afterward figure out everything

5175.76 --> 5180.88
that's happened no they already knew it

5178.0 --> 5182.88
was going on and that's even before the

5180.88 --> 5185.88
internet age people

5182.88 --> 5185.88
okay

5218.639 --> 5222.08
anyway a logical conclusion

5220.639 --> 5224.08
interesting to have somebody in the

5222.08 --> 5225.679
family that's the criminal forensic

5224.08 --> 5227.199
psychologist

5225.679 --> 5229.6
i don't know i'd be interested in

5227.199 --> 5229.599999999999
talking

5229.84 --> 5233.679
or testing

5231.28 --> 5233.679
with that

5233.76 --> 5238.2390000000005
but

5235.12 --> 5241.28
i'm just a little i'm not like oh yeah

5238.239 --> 5243.12
i'm gonna get a career in that no but

5241.28 --> 5245.759999999999
i'm interested and i'm at least

5243.12 --> 5248.08
interested to see if i can help out

5245.76 --> 5250.719
somehow right don't necessarily want

5248.08 --> 5252.88
like a career out of it but i'm always

5250.719 --> 5255.76
interested in helping out

5252.88 --> 5255.76
like anyone

5257.6 --> 5263.120000000001
like even

5259.84 --> 5265.6
certain people in government

5263.12 --> 5266.719
because i am just concerned

5265.6 --> 5268.400000000001
with

5266.719 --> 5269.92
stabilization

5268.4 --> 5271.12
and there's a whole bunch of other

5269.92 --> 5273.76
people

5271.12 --> 5275.84
out there in different positions that

5273.76 --> 5277.4400000000005
are too

5275.84 --> 5279.04
and they're all just trying to get

5277.44 --> 5282.32
around trying to figure it out and i

5279.04 --> 5282.32
want to help all of them

5283.76 --> 5291.679
people in the police forces people in

5287.92 --> 5293.679
like in the government itself

5291.679 --> 5296.719
registration like all kinds of things

5293.679 --> 5299.4400000000005
planners think tanks i am interested in

5296.719 --> 5301.28
the good people among them

5299.44 --> 5304.4
that want to make a better world in

5301.28 --> 5306.239
helping them understand how it works

5304.4 --> 5307.5199999999995
and what would be the best decisions

5306.239 --> 5311.239
based on

5307.52 --> 5311.2390000000005
abroad oversight

5329.76 --> 5333.08
oh [ __ ]

5338.96 --> 5341.679
oh damn

5341.76 --> 5346.0
that's not good yeah

5343.52 --> 5347.679
i think some kid had like a an accident

5346.0 --> 5351.32
falling and he's bleeding or something

5347.679 --> 5351.32
and panicking outside

5352.4 --> 5355.92
hope it'll be all right

5360.08 --> 5366.48
i'm so weird man like every time

5363.84 --> 5368.400000000001
like that i'm like

5366.48 --> 5370.4
i got an instinct to just like rush

5368.4 --> 5372.96
outside and see if i can offer like

5370.4 --> 5374.96
medical assistance or something

5372.96 --> 5376.639
but it's crazy and it would take me like

5374.96 --> 5380.4800000000005
two minutes to even get there and they

5376.639 --> 5380.4800000000005
don't know who i am etc but

5381.12 --> 5386.4
that's just an instinct it's just i'm

5383.36 --> 5388.5599999999995
like a medic instinct because i can do

5386.4 --> 5390.879999999999
basic things right especially when

5388.56 --> 5393.04
everybody's still like freshly

5390.88 --> 5394.96
like nervous so they don't know might be

5393.04 --> 5396.96
a little panicked i can keep my head

5394.96 --> 5399.679
cool like quickly

5396.96 --> 5403.679
i'm not like a field surgeon or anything

5399.679 --> 5403.679
but i do know like good

5403.92 --> 5407.679
ways of dealing with it

5405.679 --> 5410.08
quickly and i'm not afraid

5407.679 --> 5412.2390000000005
i could probably have never done it

5410.08 --> 5414.5599999999995
before but i could probably like stitch

5412.239 --> 5414.5599999999995
up a

5414.8 --> 5420.2390000000005
stitch up a

5416.239 --> 5423.44
minor flesh wound or something

5420.239 --> 5425.839999999999
like i wouldn't be afraid to do it

5423.44 --> 5425.839999999999
anyway

5426.32 --> 5430.719
so every time like especially when i see

5428.639 --> 5433.1990000000005
like a kid or a hair kid like that's

5430.719 --> 5435.52
like got wounded i'm like oh i wanna

5433.199 --> 5439.4
rush over there and just see if i can

5435.52 --> 5439.400000000001
provide medical assistance

5449.6 --> 5452.639
talking layman's understanding take it

5451.28 --> 5454.719
from me she has nothing to do with

5452.639 --> 5457.1990000000005
serial killing probably right yeah

5454.719 --> 5457.199
exactly

5458.8 --> 5462.400000000001
right yeah i made that's funny you're

5460.88 --> 5464.56
saying that because that's exactly the

5462.4 --> 5467.12
point that i made there earlier logical

5464.56 --> 5467.120000000001
conclusion

5468.8 --> 5473.360000000001
but
