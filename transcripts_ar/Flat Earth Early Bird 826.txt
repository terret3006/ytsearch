73.68 --> 79.60000000000001
i'm starting an hour early today

77.68 --> 80.799
because i didn't really want to wait any

79.6 --> 84.08
longer and

80.799 --> 86.32000000000001
i'm just going to do the show earlier

84.08 --> 88.15899999999999
so it might be a longer show also might

86.32 --> 92.32
be rounding out a little

88.159 --> 96.07900000000001
earlier right

92.32 --> 99.119
whether today is yeah it's clouded

96.079 --> 99.119
it's kind of cold

99.28 --> 106.64
i noticed that like in the

103.04 --> 108.96000000000001
water bowl i put outside for the birds

106.64 --> 115.36
it was actually frozen so it is

108.96 --> 118.399
literally freezing at night

115.36 --> 118.399
it was very cold

119.04 --> 124.799
so it's not freezing anymore but it's

121.92 --> 124.799
still kind of cold

126.799 --> 130.239
and yeah very little sun

136.4 --> 139.68
right so i hope that

140.16 --> 146.79999999999998
people will find me here because i am

143.36 --> 146.8
starting an hour earlier

148.16 --> 152.879
it's just over at nathan's premiere

151.2 --> 157.83999999999997
short little premiere there were some

152.879 --> 157.84
people around

161.68 --> 164.87900000000002
right yesterday

166.56 --> 174.72
early bird show

170.0 --> 174.72
yeah it was pretty good uh

175.44 --> 178.879
yeah there was indeed no live ball

177.28 --> 181.68
busters only premiere

178.879 --> 183.51899999999998
i i didn't watch it i did go over at

181.68 --> 188.0
martin luther

183.519 --> 190.72
again though see what he was up to

188.0 --> 193.519
that's funny because he was at some

190.72 --> 193.519
point showings

193.92 --> 198.72
yeah this supposed historical figure

197.04 --> 200.56
that's actually science fiction it's

198.72 --> 201.68
really weird because i bumped into that

200.56 --> 205.36
a long time ago

201.68 --> 208.48000000000002
as well and i forgot about it but this

205.36 --> 212.0
fictional robot human

208.48 --> 214.56
from world war one that era supposedly

212.0 --> 216.48
called boilerplate and he presented it

214.56 --> 216.959
as if it was completely real and some

216.48 --> 218.56
people

216.959 --> 221.84
had never seen it before and they were

218.56 --> 224.879
like what what is this

221.84 --> 227.44
well when you look it up on wiki it is

224.879 --> 227.92
clearly denoted as fiction it was funny

227.44 --> 233.2
to

227.92 --> 233.2
to see that again uh

238.84 --> 241.84
right

252.84 --> 256.32
so

254.159 --> 259.519
i hope that some people will find their

256.32 --> 269.84
way to my chat soon

259.519 --> 269.84000000000003
our sig six watching already

283.44 --> 288.0
hello chris la jambe

288.8 --> 296.40000000000003
you found a pentagram in your birth

290.72 --> 300.8
chart okay

296.4 --> 303.67999999999995
hello every nonsense gofundme

300.8 --> 304.88
good to see you in chat i'm starting the

303.68 --> 308.24
show early this

304.88 --> 311.28
day because i didn't really want to

308.24 --> 313.039
yeah wait any longer i got up pretty

311.28 --> 315.919
early

313.039 --> 318.32
i know yeah i was i went to bed pretty

315.919 --> 318.32
early

322.84 --> 325.84
so

329.6 --> 333.28000000000003
right so after yesterday

333.6 --> 339.84000000000003
i pretty much came to the conclusion

336.84 --> 339.84
that

339.919 --> 344.479
you made me start getting up early low

342.479 --> 347.52
okay that's good

344.479 --> 350.84
getting up earliest on average

347.52 --> 353.84
mostly it's just healthy so glad to hear

350.84 --> 353.84
that

355.6 --> 359.44
however yeah my own situation

357.84 --> 362.15999999999997
financially it's

359.44 --> 363.44
it's not good i shared that yesterday i

362.16 --> 368.639
got a bit

363.44 --> 368.639
closer look on it and yeah

371.28 --> 379.52
in a in a bit to keep going

375.919 --> 382.479
i saw no other way did you see

379.52 --> 383.44
devil yeah oh yeah dell i also watch

382.479 --> 385.28
dell

383.44 --> 387.52
that's right almost forgot about that

385.28 --> 391.52
let's make a note

387.52 --> 393.75899999999996
it wasn't tricking people it was simply

391.52 --> 394.96
appealing to their basic critical

393.759 --> 399.36
thinking and then

394.96 --> 402.0
applying it to the bigger things

399.36 --> 403.6
so it was very effective i thought so i

402.0 --> 405.919
was pretty impressed by what dell was

403.6 --> 405.91900000000004
doing

407.52 --> 412.4
yeah it's not tricking at all yeah

409.84 --> 415.039
tricking you into realizing the truth

412.4 --> 416.23999999999995
yeah that when you're tricking somebody

415.039 --> 423.12
about the truth

416.24 --> 427.36
is that really tricking go fund effie

423.12 --> 427.36
hello nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

429.12 --> 436.88
all right but anyway to continue

432.4 --> 439.75899999999996
my announcement

436.88 --> 441.599
uh yeah my situation is kind of the way

439.759 --> 442.319
it has been running financially in

441.599 --> 446.15999999999997
tenable

442.319 --> 450.16
i try to get through

446.16 --> 453.12
everything also with the support that i

450.16 --> 455.91900000000004
have been getting in the last

453.12 --> 456.96
few years which have been great but it

455.919 --> 460.96
seems like it's

456.96 --> 463.75899999999996
uh yeah it's it's retracting

460.96 --> 465.44
i i don't even know for sure if it has

463.759 --> 466.0
anything to do with me i don't think so

465.44 --> 467.919
it's just

466.0 --> 469.44
financial malaise in the world in

467.919 --> 471.19899999999996
general

469.44 --> 473.44
and people just don't have the room

471.199 --> 477.28000000000003
anymore to support their local artwind

473.44 --> 482.56
as much as they used to and now i'm

477.28 --> 485.52
running into a dead corner so i have to

482.56 --> 486.4
basically decide if i want to keep this

485.52 --> 490.4
going and not

486.4 --> 492.79999999999995
radically rearrange my entire life

490.4 --> 493.52
to basically see if i can survive a

492.8 --> 498.08
period

493.52 --> 498.08
without smoking any kind of cannabis

498.479 --> 502.4
and it's not like i've never done that

501.28 --> 504.87899999999996
before i've

502.4 --> 506.71999999999997
definitely done that before although

504.879 --> 510.47900000000004
it's been a while

506.72 --> 511.59900000000005
as in over a decade that i quit for like

510.479 --> 514.7189999999999
eight years straight

511.599 --> 516.959
very strictly now i'm not saying i will

514.719 --> 520.6400000000001
absolutely do eight

516.959 --> 523.68
years straight because i have actually

520.64 --> 524.3199999999999
learned to yeah to live with it and

523.68 --> 526.399
actually

524.32 --> 528.32
get some benefits at it unfortunately

526.399 --> 531.04
though the financial

528.32 --> 532.8000000000001
detriment about it is not weighing up to

531.04 --> 536.16
the benefits

532.8 --> 536.16
so i'm gonna try to be

538.08 --> 549.839
like this because i have no choice

552.48 --> 563.839
spirits on my ass to quit

555.839 --> 563.839
today what

567.44 --> 576.8000000000001
wow patreon is down to 200 pounds that

571.76 --> 581.12
is so much

576.8 --> 581.4399999999999
yeah but i think nathan does deserve it

581.12 --> 583.44
though

581.44 --> 586.0
he puts a lot of work in everything he

583.44 --> 588.399
does and he is

586.0 --> 589.279
seems to be only increasing so i do

588.399 --> 591.12
think that nathan

589.279 --> 592.8
definitely deserves all the support he

591.12 --> 596.08
gets

592.8 --> 598.16
but i am but i am envious for a

596.08 --> 600.64
non-personal reason

598.16 --> 605.8389999999999
and i really do wish that i would get

600.64 --> 605.8389999999999
similar levels of support as well

612.72 --> 620.24
your chakra is blocked by 30 years

615.92 --> 623.04
of self-medicating pot really

620.24 --> 623.04
how does that work

628.72 --> 633.6800000000001
but yeah typical chris la jumbe because

632.88 --> 638.24
this [ __ ]

633.68 --> 638.2399999999999
is going all around i've been basically

638.68 --> 643.4399999999999
reluctantly recognizing that i'm getting

641.279 --> 645.68
signals from all sides

643.44 --> 646.6400000000001
so as i'm keeping myself in balance

645.68 --> 649.1999999999999
trying to defend

646.64 --> 652.24
the way that i live and all that i'm

649.2 --> 652.24
just noticing that

653.68 --> 660.88
that i'm just really really

657.6 --> 662.16
being even subconsciously pushed into a

660.88 --> 665.519
corner

662.16 --> 667.4399999999999
as in no you're not allowed to smoke pot

665.519 --> 669.12
smoking pot makes you a junkie and

667.44 --> 670.24
destroys your life that's like the

669.12 --> 673.279
messaging

670.24 --> 677.12
i'm getting from all sides

673.279 --> 680.24
and well on a financial level that's

677.12 --> 680.24
at this moment true

685.44 --> 689.839
you're just learning this stuff

692.64 --> 697.04
well look smoking cannabis can do all

694.959 --> 699.3599999999999
kinds of things

697.04 --> 702.48
it does have an influence on your system

699.36 --> 706.24
and yes you can definitely use it

702.48 --> 706.72
to kind of escape and then when you do

706.24 --> 710.0790000000001
that

706.72 --> 714.399
when you enter doing that

710.079 --> 714.399
in that way then it will block chakras

714.839 --> 720.32
absolutely

717.04 --> 731.8389999999999
but if you don't do that then it

720.32 --> 731.839
yeah it doesn't have to lead to that

737.2 --> 745.12
all right like my chakras

741.839 --> 748.399
are not blocked if anything

745.12 --> 759.839
they make me more sensitive

748.399 --> 759.839
it makes me more sensitive

762.639 --> 766.24
right but hey being more sensitive

765.6 --> 769.519
actually

766.24 --> 770.88
makes the sensation potentially more

769.519 --> 773.68
risky

770.88 --> 775.8389999999999
which could quickly or lead you to kind

773.68 --> 775.8389999999999
of

778.72 --> 785.36
apply a block to protect yourself

782.56 --> 787.68
from those senses right that's also how

785.36 --> 791.04
blocking works so if you smoke

787.68 --> 794.7199999999999
and you get more sensitive then

791.04 --> 796.56
that increase in sensitivity sensitivity

794.72 --> 798.48
you might not be able to properly deal

796.56 --> 801.279
with it and then

798.48 --> 802.0790000000001
as an instinctive response you might

801.279 --> 805.92
close off

802.079 --> 809.92
a chakra or slightly to prevent

805.92 --> 812.8389999999999
the the sensitivity from basically

809.92 --> 814.3199999999999
you receiving damage from things out

812.839 --> 817.0400000000001
there

814.32 --> 819.1990000000001
right so you could say that it is a mind

817.04 --> 822.3199999999999
block

819.199 --> 826.399
it's all about how you deal with it

822.32 --> 830.0
right but yeah for me

826.399 --> 833.76
yeah it's purely only financial

830.0 --> 833.76
only it really is

841.279 --> 845.68
but i've done it before i'll i'll look i

844.16 --> 848.7199999999999
have to get through this

845.68 --> 850.16
i am not going to try to pretend like

848.72 --> 852.32
[ __ ] isn't happening

850.16 --> 856.399
and just continue what the hell is going

852.32 --> 859.7600000000001
on with the screen

856.399 --> 859.76
this is weird [ __ ]

869.68 --> 874.4799999999999
right well chris lagembe kind of has a

872.959 --> 876.16
fist or rule for myself

874.48 --> 878.399
although i have even trouble of holding

876.16 --> 880.639
it i've always realized

878.399 --> 882.8
that in times of great tension and when

880.639 --> 886.72
you're very nervous especially cannabis

882.8 --> 886.7199999999999
can actually be quite disruptive

893.36 --> 895.6
right

896.8 --> 902.639
and i don't know why but my does anybody

899.76 --> 906.0
is anybody else picking up on the

902.639 --> 907.36
visual distortions seeing visual

906.0 --> 910.0
distortions in the

907.36 --> 913.839
in the video what is this anybody else

910.0 --> 913.839
picking up on this

925.04 --> 928.3199999999999
right so i'm gonna have to live like

927.839 --> 933.12
this

928.32 --> 933.12
see if i still can keep afloat

934.16 --> 938.639
right well chris lagombe that's not how

936.48 --> 941.839
it works ever

938.639 --> 941.839
there is no last hit

942.16 --> 947.4399999999999
that never works ever you get it

945.6 --> 949.0400000000001
if you really want to quit you gotta

947.44 --> 952.399
quit immediately

949.04 --> 956.399
immediately upon realization never

952.399 --> 957.839
one last never ever there is no quitting

956.399 --> 960.72
and one last hit

957.839 --> 969.839
doesn't exist it's always now that's the

960.72 --> 969.839
only way to do it

971.44 --> 974.0790000000001
yeah ah

975.199 --> 980.399
so either you quit or you stop bitching

978.0 --> 980.399
about it

980.88 --> 983.92
sorry to be like that i'm being like

983.279 --> 985.8389999999999
that

983.92 --> 987.04
kind of like a projection because that

985.839 --> 989.6800000000001
is the way that i

987.04 --> 990.56
really have to do it i've never seen

989.68 --> 992.88
anybody

990.56 --> 993.5999999999999
any pot smoker ever successfully trying

992.88 --> 996.8
to quit

993.6 --> 999.44
taking one last hit never ever

996.8 --> 1001.4399999999999
and that includes myself it never works

999.44 --> 1004.8000000000001
trust me on this

1001.44 --> 1006.24
either you quit or you ignore that you

1004.8 --> 1007.279
should quit and then just do whatever

1006.24 --> 1011.839
the [ __ ] you want

1007.279 --> 1011.8389999999999
it's no in between

1023.36 --> 1027.919
all right that's good to hear i was

1025.28 --> 1031.6789999999999
almost thinking

1027.919 --> 1034.48
right so with me i still have cannabis

1031.679 --> 1036.3190000000002
i have it i'm just not gonna smoke it

1034.48 --> 1037.679
it's how i did it the last time did you

1036.319 --> 1040.48
know that when i quit

1037.679 --> 1040.959
cannabis for eight consecutive years

1040.48 --> 1044.079
without

1040.959 --> 1048.96
exception eight years i had us

1044.079 --> 1053.28
like this bag of like 200 grams

1048.96 --> 1057.28
that i just didn't use for eight years

1053.28 --> 1057.28
because if you wanna finish it

1057.679 --> 1067.8400000000001
it's never gonna end

1068.16 --> 1072.88
right for me it really has to be a

1070.0 --> 1081.84
conscious control decision

1072.88 --> 1081.8400000000001
otherwise it's never going to work

1084.32 --> 1088.24
why don't you try to earn some of your

1086.0 --> 1092.0
own money oh you mean

1088.24 --> 1094.559
by professionally youtubing every day

1092.0 --> 1098.08
and having a show and having it

1094.559 --> 1101.2
basically open question hour

1098.08 --> 1103.9189999999999
some psychological warfare training

1101.2 --> 1104.48
that you have to take for granted yeah i

1103.919 --> 1108.16
am

1104.48 --> 1110.88
i am making money i am doing this i'm

1108.16 --> 1113.28
contributing on other channels

1110.88 --> 1114.16
that's how i make money it's my most

1113.28 --> 1119.36
successful

1114.16 --> 1119.3600000000001
financial endeavor of my entire life

1122.799 --> 1126.8799999999999
red pill trill yeah

1126.96 --> 1134.0
that is it i'm not going to enroll

1130.88 --> 1136.3200000000002
in some prefab socialist

1134.0 --> 1137.52
appointed job that is going to

1136.32 --> 1141.4399999999998
absolutely

1137.52 --> 1141.44
demean me and wreck my life

1146.72 --> 1154.88
at what cost

1151.6 --> 1157.1999999999998
oh well currently at cost

1154.88 --> 1159.679
of not being able to smoke cannabis and

1157.2 --> 1159.679
that's it

1163.44 --> 1167.6000000000001
and i have to deal with people like you

1165.6 --> 1168.1599999999999
you know that's the biggest detriment

1167.6 --> 1171.9189999999999
people

1168.16 --> 1175.2
always whining whining

1171.919 --> 1177.1200000000001
projecting their own pain just trying

1175.2 --> 1180.32
to discourage trying to make it

1177.12 --> 1184.9599999999998
impossible for a flat earther to survive

1180.32 --> 1188.6399999999999
yeah that that's the real detriment

1184.96 --> 1188.64
that's the real downside of doing all

1190.84 --> 1193.84
this

1194.24 --> 1199.679
there are plenty of ways right by for

1197.52 --> 1203.679
example asking for support

1199.679 --> 1205.679
support right so support my channel

1203.679 --> 1208.72
if you have any appreciation for

1205.679 --> 1211.6000000000001
anything i've ever done

1208.72 --> 1213.44
and hope that i might actually continue

1211.6 --> 1216.6399999999999
doing this

1213.44 --> 1219.3600000000001
on the level and not just being

1216.64 --> 1220.0
a downer all the time and complaining

1219.36 --> 1223.28
please help

1220.0 --> 1225.52
me then freaking support me

1223.28 --> 1226.8799999999999
it's empirically proven that supporting

1225.52 --> 1230.1589999999999
me actually

1226.88 --> 1233.7600000000002
makes my quality go up right

1230.159 --> 1237.3600000000001
it's provable it's it's true

1233.76 --> 1237.36
so stop complaining

1238.24 --> 1242.08
about that i'm not doing something else

1240.24 --> 1249.84
to make money and just

1242.08 --> 1249.84
help me do this successfully

1256.0 --> 1259.36
that's not earning your own money all

1257.76 --> 1262.48
right so red pill trail

1259.36 --> 1266.0
so when you get some standardized

1262.48 --> 1269.76
job right at a firm at a company

1266.0 --> 1274.559
and they pay you for your services

1269.76 --> 1277.44
is that your money is that your money

1274.559 --> 1279.52
or did you get it from the firm it's not

1277.44 --> 1280.799
actually your money you earned they just

1279.52 --> 1282.72
gave it to you

1280.799 --> 1286.4
because you happen to work and be

1282.72 --> 1286.4
contracted red pill trail

1290.799 --> 1297.36
so how is that earning your own money

1293.84 --> 1301.6789999999999
under contract and how is

1297.36 --> 1305.28
doing something on as a service

1301.679 --> 1307.2
for everybody to use or ignore

1305.28 --> 1309.2
and then asking money for that on a

1307.2 --> 1312.24
voluntary basis is how is that

1309.2 --> 1312.24
not earning money

1317.2 --> 1320.32
you earn that money not a handout oh

1319.12 --> 1325.28
really

1320.32 --> 1327.52
so i could just not do this show anymore

1325.28 --> 1327.52
right

1329.76 --> 1333.679
would you like that would you like it if

1331.52 --> 1336.96

tell me tell me i'm doomed tell me that

1352.559 --> 1361.84
as a flat earther it is impossible to

1354.64 --> 1361.8400000000001
survive in this world tell me

1362.72 --> 1367.1200000000001
you do show and earn money right

1367.84 --> 1374.0
right so donate to my paypal that's

1371.12 --> 1374.799
that's how this works best that's how i

1374.0 --> 1377.84
get around

1374.799 --> 1379.44
how i get the best motivation the least

1377.84 --> 1382.0
strings attached that are going to be

1379.44 --> 1389.3600000000001
used to strangle me in the end

1382.0 --> 1393.28
right to rip the faculties from me

1389.36 --> 1393.28
and then i keep keep doing this keep

1400.84 --> 1403.84
contributing

1406.24 --> 1412.799

1409.679 --> 1417.919

1452.72 --> 1459.84
i'm gonna leave room for people

1454.559 --> 1459.84
that are actually decent human beings

1466.72 --> 1471.6000000000001
so mark marcus dresden if that comment

1469.919 --> 1475.039
is directed at me

1471.6 --> 1475.039
is that comment directed at me

1475.76 --> 1479.12
i think it is so i think you're going to

1477.52 --> 1482.08
get banned i think my banned list is

1479.12 --> 1484.4799999999998
going to get a whole lot bigger now

1482.08 --> 1486.1589999999999
because i'm not taking this [ __ ] from

1484.48 --> 1488.72
you anymore

1486.159 --> 1488.72
none of you

1497.84 --> 1502.72
i thought i thought i would open up the

1499.679 --> 1505.76
doors get some understanding going

1502.72 --> 1509.76
all that i've got from you ballers

1505.76 --> 1513.6
is you trying to pull me to your side

1509.76 --> 1516.48
and then give me some petty sympathy

1513.6 --> 1519.4399999999998
as a consolidation prize yeah that's not

1516.48 --> 1521.52
what i did this for

1519.44 --> 1524.0
yeah that's not why i gave you a room i

1521.52 --> 1525.52
did not give you the room in my chat

1524.0 --> 1529.36
because it's your [ __ ]

1525.52 --> 1531.44
right you got that i gave it to you as

1529.36 --> 1534.1589999999999
an opportunity

1531.44 --> 1536.799
and you're wasting it so i'm not doing

1534.159 --> 1536.7990000000002
it anymore

1537.12 --> 1543.6789999999999
yeah i might actually just entirely give

1540.24 --> 1547.039
up on my dual cosmology

1543.679 --> 1550.5590000000002
feel for the future and

1547.039 --> 1557.12
and yeah and maybe go

1550.559 --> 1559.9189999999999
more in the direction of no no

1557.12 --> 1562.7199999999998
maybe not a balance for you after all

1559.919 --> 1566.0800000000002
maybe you're just going to have to

1562.72 --> 1567.279
roll up and retract for the lies that

1566.08 --> 1571.1999999999998
you've accepted

1567.279 --> 1573.52
and pay the price on the long run

1571.2 --> 1574.72
so maybe i'm not going to be so helpful

1573.52 --> 1578.48
and nice

1574.72 --> 1580.96
about that anymore yeah

1578.48 --> 1582.64
because you've done nothing but [ __ ] on

1580.96 --> 1586.159
me

1582.64 --> 1588.48
most of you not all of you some people

1586.159 --> 1589.5200000000002

1588.48 --> 1592.64

the effort you really want to donate

1685.6 --> 1692.6399999999999
it will be my first bitcoin donation too

1689.44 --> 1696.0
never had that before i have used it in

1692.64 --> 1697.679
trade like oh you can trade

1696.0 --> 1699.679
this crypto into bitcoin and then

1697.679 --> 1700.3990000000001
bitcoin into money and that's the way

1699.679 --> 1711.8400000000001
that i've

1700.399 --> 1711.84
dealt with it only really

1722.84 --> 1725.84
so

1730.399 --> 1739.84
what else did i do

1750.84 --> 1753.84
notes

1760.399 --> 1767.84
been working but been good okay well

1762.24 --> 1767.84
good to hear glashaw

1767.919 --> 1781.8400000000001
what am i working on this week is that a

1770.64 --> 1781.8400000000001
question to me or to gladshaw

1789.52 --> 1795.84
all right

1796.24 --> 1809.84
well what i personally have been working

1798.159 --> 1809.8400000000001
on most is just cleaning up the house

1812.72 --> 1816.0
right as for in the flatter debates it's

1814.64 --> 1819.279
mostly just

1816.0 --> 1821.039
like numpty clip fishing now

1819.279 --> 1822.96
the ballers they're never getting uh

1821.039 --> 1825.44
giving up they're never improving

1822.96 --> 1825.44
they're just

1827.039 --> 1832.559
weaponizing their own delusions

1830.559 --> 1834.8799999999999
so that's what it's been mostly there's

1832.559 --> 1836.799
barely any effective communication left

1834.88 --> 1838.7990000000002
with the ballers that come over at the

1836.799 --> 1841.279
flat earth debates

1838.799 --> 1842.799
they're just not interested in figuring

1841.279 --> 1845.76
it out anymore they're only

1842.799 --> 1847.76
interested in figuring how to bypass

1845.76 --> 1851.84
reality it's the only thing they're

1847.76 --> 1851.84
interested in anymore

1851.919 --> 1856.48
so yeah that's when i can report about

1862.84 --> 1865.84
it

1890.84 --> 1893.84
hmm

1901.279 --> 1907.84
let's see what's going on

1926.64 --> 1931.76
right so yeah i'm pretty much open for

1930.08 --> 1935.84
questions

1931.76 --> 1935.84
want me to explain something anything

1935.919 --> 1949.8400000000001
a question about something what's going

1937.76 --> 1949.84
on out there ask

1979.679 --> 1984.64
all right well i'm gonna be back in two

1982.96 --> 1991.8400000000001
minutes hope to see some questions in

1984.64 --> 1991.8400000000001
chat when i get back

2072.839 --> 2075.839
oh

2082.159 --> 2087.599
ah nice to see the show's still going

2086.159 --> 2089.44
yeah sure gladshaw

2087.599 --> 2091.679
look i'm gonna be here i'm gonna do the

2089.44 --> 2091.679
show

2096.72 --> 2103.839
it's a little difficult nowadays though

2098.8 --> 2103.8390000000004
to keep the flow into it

2104.8 --> 2108.8
because in ways i feel like i've just

2109.28 --> 2113.28
like i've already talked about

2110.8 --> 2113.28
everything

2113.44 --> 2118.64
that's why i've attempted to

2116.56 --> 2120.64
reroute the workings of the show to be

2118.64 --> 2121.68
more directly interactive with the chat

2120.64 --> 2125.92
in the hopes that

2121.68 --> 2128.96
people in chat will yeah bring in

2125.92 --> 2132.079
good questions good ideas

2128.96 --> 2134.7200000000003
that i can reflect upon and expand upon

2132.079 --> 2136.32
because that is something that i can do

2134.72 --> 2138.72
that i can always do

2136.32 --> 2141.2000000000003
but yeah in that sense i am dependent on

2138.72 --> 2144.3999999999996
who's going to join in chat

2141.2 --> 2146.24
and there's some people that been coming

2144.4 --> 2148.1600000000003
in chat regularly and every time they do

2146.24 --> 2151.359
they always bring

2148.16 --> 2153.04
good questions good remarks that really

2151.359 --> 2155.2
get me going

2153.04 --> 2157.7599999999998
because it is kind of dependent on who

2155.2 --> 2160.0789999999997
is there if it's just me

2157.76 --> 2162.32
talking against the chat that doesn't

2160.079 --> 2164.88

those on

2227.599 --> 2230.1600000000003
that's right

2240.88 --> 2244.8
like i have to present something

2245.28 --> 2249.599
well to the to the government that's

2248.88 --> 2252.8
giving me

2249.599 --> 2255.04
social welfare to get around pay my rent

2252.8 --> 2256.5600000000004
i have to show them something that i'm

2255.04 --> 2258.72
actually

2256.56 --> 2260.48
getting some income that's why i turn

2258.72 --> 2262.72
the ads on

2260.48 --> 2263.76
and then who knows where my situation at

2262.72 --> 2267.2
some point if

2263.76 --> 2270.48
ever is going to go that i can

2267.2 --> 2274.48
ascend out of this temporary poverty

2270.48 --> 2277.599
somehow and get it yeah get off social

2274.48 --> 2281.52
welfare and then suddenly

2277.599 --> 2284.4
all that income from all the revenue

2281.52 --> 2285.28
from the advertisement will actually

2284.4 --> 2288.48
benefit me

2285.28 --> 2290.079
much more but i have to give something

2288.48 --> 2292.72
to show for

2290.079 --> 2292.7200000000003
to them

2297.52 --> 2313.839
all right well thank you glad show i

2300.48 --> 2313.839
appreciate that

2315.119 --> 2327.839
it's ridiculous redfield trill seriously

2328.0 --> 2334.4
like merchandising is not going to

2331.28 --> 2336.5600000000004
get me out of this financial position

2334.4 --> 2341.839
okay red pill drill it's not

2336.56 --> 2341.839
it's not gonna do that yeah

2366.48 --> 2371.599
like if i again if i had some stable

2369.52 --> 2375.359
income then it might help a little

2371.599 --> 2378.4
you know like in every little bit helps

2375.359 --> 2383.839
in my current position it doesn't

2378.4 --> 2383.839
it really doesn't

2387.119 --> 2391.04
and besides i'm not really too eager to

2389.52 --> 2397.839
get out merchandising

2391.04 --> 2397.839
i never really have

2418.319 --> 2421.7599999999998
all right so yeah one more smart ass

2420.72 --> 2425.839
remark like that

2421.76 --> 2439.8390000000004
red pill true and i'm banning you okay

2425.839 --> 2439.839
just so you know

2450.319 --> 2455.119
yeah right also this afternoon if

2452.24 --> 2455.1189999999997
everything works out

2457.359 --> 2461.2799999999997
animekin is going to help me upgrade the

2459.68 --> 2465.1189999999997
visuals

2461.28 --> 2465.119
that i was talking about a week ago

2465.68 --> 2468.72
and see if the if i can get that done

2467.68 --> 2471.2799999999997
and

2468.72 --> 2473.04
more importantly i really hope i can get

2471.28 --> 2475.52
like the sound in order because it's

2473.04 --> 2478.16
been nagging me

2475.52 --> 2478.96
the way the sound now works and my

2478.16 --> 2481.92
complete

2478.96 --> 2485.76
inability to do anything about it like i

2481.92 --> 2488.88
can't alter it anymore like i used to be

2485.76 --> 2492.88
it's it's really aggravating it makes

2488.88 --> 2496.079
no freaking sense makes no

2492.88 --> 2498.4
sense whatsoever

2496.079 --> 2501.8390000000004
that suddenly these options have been

2498.4 --> 2501.839
taken away from the system

2505.92 --> 2509.839
yes i'm in the netherlands as always

2562.48 --> 2568.56
right so anything flat earth related

2565.359 --> 2568.56
anybody would like to know

2568.8 --> 2573.92
otherwise i'll i'll start just asking

2571.2 --> 2577.359
test questions i guess

2573.92 --> 2582.319
like for example do do you

2577.359 --> 2585.5989999999997
know why so many flat earthers

2582.319 --> 2589.839
think the earth is a disk can you

2585.599 --> 2594.48
tell me what can you give me

2589.839 --> 2597.52
an analysis as to why you think

2594.48 --> 2601.52
specifically as specific as you can that

2597.52 --> 2604.56
a lot of flat earthers basically assume

2601.52 --> 2606.16
from their perspective with certainty

2604.56 --> 2609.839
that the earth is actually

2606.16 --> 2612.8799999999997
a flat disc maybe

2609.839 --> 2612.88
maybe i can do that

2615.92 --> 2619.28
the btc i said we'll go further than

2618.24 --> 2635.839
okay

2619.28 --> 2635.8390000000004
okay i'll check it out

2638.24 --> 2642.0
i have not received

2642.16 --> 2649.839
any btc so far

2653.52 --> 2663.839
but i'll take a look later

2682.079 --> 2685.44
it can take five minutes or two hours

2684.319 --> 2688.64
really i didn't know that

2685.44 --> 2691.839
okay anyway thanks for for doing that

2688.64 --> 2695.04
i really appreciate it

2691.839 --> 2696.0789999999997
it's also good to yeah see if it

2695.04 --> 2697.52

if you wanted a place here you should

2820.319 --> 2824.24
have supported me but instead you chose

2822.72 --> 2827.04
to just

2824.24 --> 2827.5989999999997
try to backstab me at every corner every

2827.04 --> 2831.839
moment

2827.599 --> 2831.839
so you're just out outta here

2837.44 --> 2844.96
i don't need you you understand i don't

2841.28 --> 2847.3590000000004
need your supposed 99

2844.96 --> 2848.16
of the world's presence believing in the

2847.359 --> 2850.72
ball i don't

2848.16 --> 2851.52
[ __ ] need you you can all take the

2850.72 --> 2859.839
vaccine

2851.52 --> 2859.839
and die as far as i'm concerned okay

2870.839 --> 2873.839
so

2898.0 --> 2904.48
right so getting closer to the first

2901.839 --> 2908.319
hour mark

2904.48 --> 2912.4
i'm gonna do something unusual

2908.319 --> 2915.839
i'm gonna roll a basic cigarette

2912.4 --> 2915.839
for myself

2917.92 --> 2922.0
because yeah that's the one downside is

2920.72 --> 2925.1189999999997
that i still smoke

2922.0 --> 2927.52
and yeah on cannabis it does give me a

2925.119 --> 2930.4
tendency to smoke a little bit more

2927.52 --> 2930.8
the regular tobacco at least that's not

2930.4 --> 2933.44
as

2930.8 --> 2933.44
expensive

2935.52 --> 2943.839
so that's just gonna happen

2944.16 --> 2950.16
oh that's not true glashaw there's

2946.24 --> 2950.16
plenty of people believing in globes

2950.96 --> 2955.2
unfortunately the vast majority of

2953.839 --> 2958.319
mankind has been

2955.2 --> 2961.4399999999996
utterly trained

2958.319 --> 2965.2799999999997
to believe the worst possible

2961.44 --> 2968.16
like up to suicidal mentally suicidal

2965.28 --> 2971.3590000000004
levels of stupidity and error

2968.16 --> 2972.319
yeah vast majority of people have been

2971.359 --> 2975.68
conditioned to

2972.319 --> 2979.04
act accept forever and

2975.68 --> 2983.44
exert them on others lies

2979.04 --> 2988.319
huge glaring lies forever

2983.44 --> 2991.04
that's hell that's literally your mind

2988.319 --> 2992.64
taking a sidestep from reality and

2991.04 --> 2999.839
staying there

2992.64 --> 2999.839
that's what that is

3001.119 --> 3005.44
right well it's very simple a past life

3004.64 --> 3010.0789999999997
regression

3005.44 --> 3013.839
donate donate to me or shut the [ __ ] up

3010.079 --> 3013.8390000000004

yeah georgetown for hello yeah it is an

3041.119 --> 3045.2000000000003
early start it is kind of weird i guess

amsterdam time in the weekend and i

3046.8 --> 3051.04

3051.04 --> 3055.839
an hour extra

3056.559 --> 3062.559
roll out the new policy

3059.68 --> 3064.8799999999997
policy of no more globe squirters it's

3062.559 --> 3064.88
over

3065.2 --> 3071.1189999999997
no more globe squirters at all

3068.88 --> 3072.4
does not means that for example people

3071.119 --> 3074.1600000000003
like tiny womble

3072.4 --> 3076.319
are not welcome they're still welcome

3074.16 --> 3079.2799999999997
because i know tiny womble

3076.319 --> 3079.2799999999997
knows how it is

3081.44 --> 3084.48
he's not neurotic about his glow belief

3084.16 --> 3087.7599999999998
he

3084.48 --> 3092.0
he yeah

3087.76 --> 3094.88
he's been great so unless he starts to

3092.0 --> 3097.839
act outrageous as well he's just welcome

3094.88 --> 3097.839
here

3099.52 --> 3104.319
all right so

3102.72 --> 3106.64
putting a little bit of clove powder in

3104.319 --> 3106.64
there

3107.92 --> 3111.839
because i like that

3151.599 --> 3153.839
wow

3156.96 --> 3161.599
all right also one thing i could say

3162.559 --> 3168.7200000000003
have you ever considered getting the

3166.16 --> 3172.0789999999997
[ __ ] out you [ __ ] scumbag

3168.72 --> 3174.3999999999996
piss off yeah

3172.079 --> 3181.8390000000004
piss off and all your sucker counts get

3174.4 --> 3181.839
the [ __ ] out

3192.079 --> 3197.119
anybody else i'll ban

3195.28 --> 3200.559
[ __ ] thousand people today if i need

3197.119 --> 3203.2000000000003
to i will i don't give a [ __ ]

3200.559 --> 3203.6800000000003
you troll pieces of [ __ ] can literally

3203.2 --> 3207.4399999999996
drop

3203.68 --> 3209.9199999999996
dead and i'll celebrate it physically

3207.44 --> 3213.599
literally drop dead and i'll celebrate

3209.92 --> 3213.599
it hear me scumbags

3214.079 --> 3218.7200000000003
i don't give a [ __ ] about your belief

3217.04 --> 3222.72
your peer pressure

3218.72 --> 3224.0789999999997
your nagging your demonic manipulative

3222.72 --> 3227.1189999999997
behavior you can all

3224.079 --> 3227.119
[ __ ] die

3230.72 --> 3234.16
now if you want to learn something

3232.319 --> 3237.2
however that's something different

3234.16 --> 3240.16
you know i used to believe the globe i

3237.2 --> 3243.52
thought it was possible

3240.16 --> 3246.72
till i was confronted by certain things

3243.52 --> 3249.599
that basically [ __ ] yeah revealed that

3246.72 --> 3251.7599999999998
it is mechanically impossible

3249.599 --> 3252.96
and then i got really confused about it

3251.76 --> 3256.559
and kind of like

3252.96 --> 3259.44
tried what rompus has been dedicated to

3256.559 --> 3261.2000000000003
doing in general he never gives up i did

3259.44 --> 3265.839
give up at some point because i

3261.2 --> 3265.839
always had the

3265.92 --> 3270.2400000000002
fundamental agreement with myself that

3269.76 --> 3273.8390000000004
it would

3270.24 --> 3275.9199999999996
always give recognition to empirical

3273.839 --> 3278.0
mechanical truth when it is revealed to

3275.92 --> 3279.92
me i would rather accept

3278.0 --> 3281.52
that everybody is confused and doesn't

3279.92 --> 3284.559
understand

3281.52 --> 3286.4
and would and is going to bypass

3284.559 --> 3288.0
issues they can't resolve in order to

3286.4 --> 3289.839
reinforce their belief

3288.0 --> 3293.839
except that that is always going to be

3289.839 --> 3293.839
the case including with myself

3294.24 --> 3297.4399999999996
and yeah that was a good decision

3296.72 --> 3300.64
because

3297.44 --> 3303.52
when i was still a ball believer

3300.64 --> 3303.52
i did do that

3304.799 --> 3308.799
i bypassed a whole bunch of things

3306.72 --> 3312.5589999999997
because it had to be a ball that was the

3308.799 --> 3316.079
objective that's the task we're given

3312.559 --> 3319.44
when we're kids to help contribute

3316.079 --> 3323.28
figuring out how the earth is a ball

3319.44 --> 3325.52
and to basically reinforce

3323.28 --> 3326.96
the conclusion that we always knew it

3325.52 --> 3329.28
was all that [ __ ]

3326.96 --> 3331.119
yeah that's like a mission you're handed

3329.28 --> 3335.8390000000004
over culturally

3331.119 --> 3335.839
through school through television

3346.839 --> 3349.839
everywhere

3356.799 --> 3362.64
right well for me i was a little bit

3359.92 --> 3367.28
more flexible and that's also well

3362.64 --> 3370.5589999999997
plenty of plenty obvious considering

3367.28 --> 3373.76
how well i am at how good i am

3370.559 --> 3374.799
at figuring out presuppositional

3373.76 --> 3378.7990000000004
possibilities

3374.799 --> 3382.0
of what is just like that what is

3378.799 --> 3382.319
right not even like how can it be this

3382.0 --> 3385.839
or

3382.319 --> 3388.88
no just what is what is

3385.839 --> 3391.92
just what is that's it what is

3388.88 --> 3395.44
what do we not know about what is what

3391.92 --> 3397.6800000000003
are the signs as to what could be

3395.44 --> 3399.76
i've always been good at that and even

3397.68 --> 3403.68
as i was still a glober i

3399.76 --> 3406.48
heard more superficial less

3403.68 --> 3406.48
physics based

3407.28 --> 3410.6400000000003
revelations about that the earth is not

3409.599 --> 3413.04
a ball

3410.64 --> 3415.04
and i got into that and even understood

3413.04 --> 3417.44
it but i was keeping myself

3415.04 --> 3420.319
cognitively separated because it was

3417.44 --> 3422.64
basically entertaining a new concept

3420.319 --> 3423.359
and in the end when it turned out that

3422.64 --> 3426.24
the people

3423.359 --> 3426.96
basically handing me this insight that

3426.24 --> 3429.1189999999997
they

3426.96 --> 3431.76
and this is different from people here

3429.119 --> 3434.2400000000002
on youtube that i've met so far

3431.76 --> 3436.48
those people did it in secret and they

3434.24 --> 3439.2
had like a secret agenda they wanted to

3436.48 --> 3441.76
manipulate me into

3439.2 --> 3442.5589999999997
and i didn't fall for that and that also

3441.76 --> 3446.079
caused me to

3442.559 --> 3449.3590000000004
literally say i can't trust this right

3446.079 --> 3450.079
so some freaking weirdos out there that

3449.359 --> 3453.119
were like

3450.079 --> 3456.319
sorta trying to create a cult

3453.119 --> 3458.4
i think they kind of used flat earth for

3456.319 --> 3461.7599999999998
that yeah that's

3458.4 --> 3465.76
that's very harsh and it's like

3461.76 --> 3467.5200000000004
really dark in retrospect

3465.76 --> 3471.3590000000004
so i don't trust those people i will

3467.52 --> 3474.0
never speak to those people again

3471.359 --> 3476.319
and that's not my regular friend circle

3474.0 --> 3480.64
by the way it's something i got

3476.319 --> 3483.359
into separately until i figured out that

3480.64 --> 3485.2
basically the people leading that were

3483.359 --> 3487.2
completely irresponsible and even

3485.2 --> 3490.319
pathological liars at times

3487.2 --> 3491.839
when they were stressed so yeah i

3490.319 --> 3494.48
figured out this is not

3491.839 --> 3496.48
any kind of road to salvation this is

3494.48 --> 3500.16
not going to help me enlighten

3496.48 --> 3501.04
so i'll just be eclectic as i was before

3500.16 --> 3504.0
that and just

3501.04 --> 3516.0
figure it all my out myself because

3504.0 --> 3518.799
nobody else can

3516.0 --> 3520.24
right yeah clutch bear for example those

3518.799 --> 3523.68
people that tried to

3520.24 --> 3524.64
graft me into their scheme they didn't

3523.68 --> 3527.1189999999997
even know

3524.64 --> 3529.2
like about the gas pressure argument

3527.119 --> 3532.799
right they were not into physics at

3529.2 --> 3534.48
all at all

3532.799 --> 3537.68
so they didn't even hand me that

3534.48 --> 3540.52
argument but they did

3537.68 --> 3543.2799999999997
basically confront me with yes the

3540.52 --> 3546.96
preponderance of what is given the most

3543.28 --> 3552.3190000000004
screen and audio time out there

3546.96 --> 3556.079
is lies for the system to keep you full

3552.319 --> 3556.079
that part did seep through

3556.4 --> 3560.079
and i was also kind of following alex

3558.96 --> 3563.359
jones

3560.079 --> 3567.2000000000003
starting to who also basically echoed

3563.359 --> 3567.2
that sentiment that insight

3568.079 --> 3573.2000000000003
so i kind of like moved on and just

3570.88 --> 3576.559
because that was very important to me

3573.2 --> 3578.72
it was very important to really ram it

3576.559 --> 3580.0
through psychologically violently to

3578.72 --> 3583.52
myself like

3580.0 --> 3583.839
yes the majority of the world is handing

3583.52 --> 3586.88
you

3583.839 --> 3590.16
information that is lies

3586.88 --> 3590.559
on purpose and there's nothing you can

3590.16 --> 3593.04
do

3590.559 --> 3594.6400000000003
to make that any other way because that

3593.04 --> 3597.52
is the way it is

3594.64 --> 3599.359
and nothing can change that and you

3597.52 --> 3601.44
rearranging how you look at things in

3599.359 --> 3603.119
your mind is not going to change that

3601.44 --> 3605.68
it's not just going to make you

3603.119 --> 3606.7200000000003
look at it differently to ignore the

3605.68 --> 3610.799
fact

3606.72 --> 3613.4399999999996
of what it is right

3610.799 --> 3615.839
that was a very brutal lesson because i

3613.44 --> 3615.839
have this

3617.52 --> 3623.28
almost creepy inside tendency to

3621.2 --> 3626.3999999999996
surrender to the world

3623.28 --> 3628.96
to be like

3626.4 --> 3630.7200000000003
like i have to trust them and if they're

3628.96 --> 3633.599
gonna kill me

3630.72 --> 3635.1189999999997
then so be it because it must be for a

3633.599 --> 3638.1600000000003
good reason because the world

3635.119 --> 3640.2400000000002
is good it must be good so if that

3638.16 --> 3642.0
if everybody's destroying me it must be

3640.24 --> 3645.1189999999997
for a good reason even if i don't

3642.0 --> 3646.16
understand that that attitude i had that

3645.119 --> 3649.599
attitude it almost

3646.16 --> 3652.8799999999997
killed me it almost literally killed me

3649.599 --> 3656.1600000000003
at times and i had to somehow break out

3652.88 --> 3661.119
of that

3656.16 --> 3661.1189999999997
cannot afford to believe

3661.839 --> 3668.319
that the world is all

3665.119 --> 3668.6400000000003
good and that the main messages out

3668.319 --> 3671.44
there

3668.64 --> 3672.799
are not lies i can't afford that i

3671.44 --> 3675.599
couldn't afford that

3672.799 --> 3676.16
it would literally kill me so it's a

3675.599 --> 3678.799
very

3676.16 --> 3680.24
tedious and long and stressful process

3678.799 --> 3684.16
with a lot of paranoia

3680.24 --> 3687.4399999999996
side effects to get that through to me

3684.16 --> 3690.799
to really get that through that people

3687.44 --> 3692.4
of the system they work within the

3690.799 --> 3695.599
system

3692.4 --> 3697.92
but when you actually test the borders

3695.599 --> 3699.92
of the system and the maneuverability

3697.92 --> 3703.04
then they all grow hostile they

3699.92 --> 3704.96
always will because they are not given

3703.04 --> 3706.4
the maneuvering room within the system

3704.96 --> 3710.2400000000002
they've only been

3706.4 --> 3712.48
given like if you do exactly

3710.24 --> 3714.72
things the way that we want that we set

3712.48 --> 3717.2
out for you then we'll kind of leave you

3714.72 --> 3727.7599999999998
alone in your sort of slave

3717.2 --> 3730.8799999999997
railroad position within the system

3727.76 --> 3733.28
and people defend that very

3730.88 --> 3735.76
feeble safe position that they might

3733.28 --> 3739.28
have attained within the system

3735.76 --> 3742.7200000000003
even though they are practically slaves

3739.28 --> 3746.1600000000003
because of it mostly slaves in their

3742.72 --> 3747.9199999999996
mind and their heart because you must do

3746.16 --> 3750.799
it like this you must do it like that

3747.92 --> 3751.44
you cannot ever be angry you cannot

3750.799 --> 3754.88
doubt

3751.44 --> 3757.92
an order when given that [ __ ]

3754.88 --> 3769.839
horrific autocratic mind control

3757.92 --> 3769.839
[ __ ] and the world is filled with it

3778.559 --> 3783.8390000000004
hey neil casatino good to see you

3796.079 --> 3803.3590000000004
right it wasn't easy for me at all

3799.44 --> 3803.359
and it was even pre-flat earth right

3805.039 --> 3808.559
it was already very tough for me even

3807.92 --> 3812.16
before

3808.559 --> 3812.1600000000003
i figured out about flat earth

3812.96 --> 3817.359
and now flat earth conceptually didn't

3815.52 --> 3820.4
make it harder for me

3817.359 --> 3821.839
but the people that refused to accept it

3820.4 --> 3825.119
and that are compelled by their

3821.839 --> 3828.48
conditioning to try and attack me

3825.119 --> 3831.76
that part that is

3828.48 --> 3834.88
like really aggravating because

3831.76 --> 3838.48
it doesn't happen as much in other

3834.88 --> 3841.52
let's just say conspiracy minded sectors

3838.48 --> 3843.2
other focuses it doesn't have that much

3841.52 --> 3845.44
of a response although it

3843.2 --> 3846.799
the response the the conditioning

3845.44 --> 3848.88
defensive responses

3846.799 --> 3852.4
in general are getting worse and that's

3848.88 --> 3856.2400000000002
yeah that's just what it is

3852.4 --> 3859.44
sleepers awaken the awakened

3856.24 --> 3861.2
awaken more get sharper get more

3859.44 --> 3864.559
strength get more burden

3861.2 --> 3868.0789999999997
the sleepers sleep deeper surrender

3864.559 --> 3871.599
more to the defensive demons that are

3868.079 --> 3873.599
that they are subjected to just to stay

3871.599 --> 3881.839
within peace of mind within their

3873.599 --> 3881.839
slavery position

3894.079 --> 3909.8390000000004
you're talking to me neil cosatino

3916.16 --> 3922.64
am i still in lockdown i i think so

3919.359 --> 3924.319
the curfew is still in effect

3922.64 --> 3927.5989999999997
although a lot of people are just

3924.319 --> 3927.599
completely ignoring it

3931.68 --> 3936.24
i don't mind i mean the curfew is not a

3935.52 --> 3939.599
good thing

3936.24 --> 3939.5989999999997
makes no freaking sense

3944.079 --> 3951.8390000000004
but i i typically don't go out late

3948.839 --> 3951.839
anyway

3959.52 --> 3979.839
top quality clutch

3963.28 --> 3979.8390000000004
resumed a car guy what

3984.799 --> 3990.799
states over here are loosening up well

3988.079 --> 3991.28
there may be some of that here as well i

3990.799 --> 3993.44
don't

3991.28 --> 3995.28
really know but people are still wearing

3993.44 --> 3998.799
the masks

3995.28 --> 4003.3590000000004
i think that recently like all or

3998.799 --> 4005.92
our glorious government has allowed it

4003.359 --> 4006.96
that barber shops can open again oh

4005.92 --> 4010.0
we're so

4006.96 --> 4011.76
thankful that we're getting permission

4010.0 --> 4014.799
from the [ __ ] government to do that

4011.76 --> 4018.2400000000002
again in this fake crisis

4014.799 --> 4021.359
thank you government for allowing

4018.24 --> 4025.839
barbers to have a job again oh

4021.359 --> 4025.839
thank you so much for that permission

4027.119 --> 4036.1600000000003
that's about as far as i know

4034.64 --> 4038.799
but i'm glad for the barbers you know

4036.16 --> 4038.799
that they still

4039.039 --> 4049.8390000000004
at least they can get back to work

4066.4 --> 4070.96
right foul and buchanan why it split up

4071.92 --> 4076.0
a lot of people are really stupid and

4074.079 --> 4078.48
they're kind of like

4076.0 --> 4079.599
trying to pretend they're smarter than

4078.48 --> 4081.839
they are

4079.599 --> 4083.039
and then there's also plenty of smart

4081.839 --> 4086.0
people

4083.039 --> 4086.88
that do pretend like they're stupid and

4086.0 --> 4088.799
you will

4086.88 --> 4092.1600000000003
it's very tough to find out because

4088.799 --> 4095.44
being stupid is what kind of

4092.16 --> 4095.44
allows them to still

4095.52 --> 4100.319
communicate and not be completely

4097.92 --> 4104.2390000000005
isolated

4100.319 --> 4105.359
for their intellect what's for lunch or

4104.239 --> 4119.839
when i don't know

4105.359 --> 4119.839
just bake eggs as usual

4130.839 --> 4137.839
right i'm gonna take

4134.319 --> 4147.839000000001
smoke this cigarette

4137.839 --> 4147.839
for a second

4369.69 --> 4372.75
[Music]

4382.84 --> 4385.84
ah

4386.32 --> 4390.5599999999995
well follow along with canon everybody

4388.64 --> 4392.96
pretty much everybody goes through a

4390.56 --> 4396.56
phase like that

4392.96 --> 4396.56
some point especially

4397.04 --> 4401.679
like between there what's this

4407.199 --> 4409.44
hey

4411.36 --> 4415.12
oh chris legendre what happened

4421.28 --> 4429.04
what the did everybody see that

4426.64 --> 4430.0
did his the account just get deleted or

4429.04 --> 4440.64
something

4430.0 --> 4443.199
oh his message is just retracted

4440.64 --> 4455.84
oh you're still there why did you delete

4443.199 --> 4455.839999999999
all that

4456.88 --> 4462.32
smiley no why why did you delete all

4460.56 --> 4464.2390000000005
that

4462.32 --> 4469.84
you know it's still in the chat on on

4464.239 --> 4469.839999999999
screen right

4476.8 --> 4481.04
the 420 stuff oh okay

4481.679 --> 4485.92
you don't have to you know look i'm not

4483.52 --> 4487.92
telling you guys you must stop or

4485.92 --> 4491.6
anything i'm just

4487.92 --> 4497.84
currently in a package right now

4491.6 --> 4497.84
so i just can't afford it that's all

4503.199 --> 4507.04
right but oh wait yeah you had some

4506.08 --> 4511.84
issues with it

4507.04 --> 4511.84
of course almost forgot about that

4522.84 --> 4525.84
right

4537.84 --> 4542.400000000001
breathing and temperament of the wall

4540.0 --> 4542.4
all right

4543.04 --> 4553.84
yeah that that might be a good moment to

4546.8 --> 4553.84
stop it then

4559.36 --> 4567.04
look fiolan buchanan that's that's

4562.159 --> 4569.199
really a nice concept

4567.04 --> 4570.56
but in practice unfortunately the

4569.199 --> 4574.48
intellectuals

4570.56 --> 4577.84
are not necessarily moral

4574.48 --> 4580.239
right it's part of the problem

4577.84 --> 4582.4800000000005
we live in a society that has been

4580.239 --> 4584.639999999999
heavily socially engineered

4582.48 --> 4586.48
by intellectuals well guess what those

4584.64 --> 4590.719
intellectuals

4586.48 --> 4593.36
don't give a [ __ ] about people at all

4590.719 --> 4596.2390000000005
so it's not better at all what

4593.36 --> 4599.92
intellectuals

4596.239 --> 4601.919999999999
currently are doing with it

4599.92 --> 4604.159
it's not helping at all it's not

4601.92 --> 4606.64
stabilizing society at all it's making

4604.159 --> 4606.639999999999
it worse

4607.36 --> 4613.199
so intellect is not shouldn't yeah you

4610.64 --> 4613.1990000000005
shouldn't be

4615.199 --> 4622.239
attain some class because of that

4619.12 --> 4624.96
you know intellect is important

4622.239 --> 4626.48
for managing things for actually being

4624.96 --> 4630.56
effective

4626.48 --> 4636.08
but it should be original

4630.56 --> 4638.400000000001
inherent spiritual moral stability

4636.08 --> 4640.0
does it because if you're really

4638.4 --> 4643.679
freaking smart

4640.0 --> 4645.6
but you're morally perverse

4643.679 --> 4647.04
you'd probably be able to hide it then

4645.6 --> 4665.84
you could literally just

4647.04 --> 4665.84
[ __ ] up society as an intellectual

4677.36 --> 4686.239
hey unicorn laser eyes and aries 106.

4681.92 --> 4688.4800000000005
yeah it's the volume is always low now

4686.239 --> 4689.678999999999
because my sound settings are just not

4688.48 --> 4691.599999999999
optimal

4689.679 --> 4694.159
and i can't do anything about it at this

4691.6 --> 4696.4800000000005
moment i will try to change it but it's

4694.159 --> 4696.799999999999
highly asymmetrical at this point i can

4696.48 --> 4707.839999999999
do

4696.8 --> 4707.84
and i can't do anything about it

4719.84 --> 4725.04
all right well found buchanan look

4723.12 --> 4726.5599999999995
i don't know why you're on onto this

4725.04 --> 4729.36
like this it's useless

4726.56 --> 4729.360000000001
you can't do it

4730.8 --> 4734.159000000001
if there's gonna be some kind of serious

4732.88 --> 4736.88
real asymmetry

4734.159 --> 4737.36
accepted than the people that accept

4736.88 --> 4743.04
that

4737.36 --> 4745.199
they go onto a path separation

4743.04 --> 4747.76
putting one person above another through

4745.199 --> 4750.4
whatever parameters

4747.76 --> 4752.719
and then eventually you always end up in

4750.4 --> 4763.839999999999
the same place

4752.719 --> 4763.84
a bad place it doesn't work

4774.84 --> 4777.84
right

4787.52 --> 4794.2390000000005
what the reference dimensional 5 to 22 d

4792.0 --> 4794.239
what

4801.92 --> 4805.679
right so yeah considering that foul

4804.719 --> 4807.679
angle kevin

4805.679 --> 4808.96
it's out of my hands and it's probably

4807.679 --> 4811.84
always going to be out of my hands

4808.96 --> 4815.36
there's literally nothing i can do

4811.84 --> 4818.719
about that i can only

4815.36 --> 4821.839999999999
try to help the ones that have

4818.719 --> 4822.159
some kind of moral compass left and that

4821.84 --> 4825.04
have

4822.159 --> 4827.36
intellects that require developing to

4825.04 --> 4830.32
help them out

4827.36 --> 4832.0
to form a counterweight i think that's

4830.32 --> 4835.199
the only effective thing that i

4832.0 --> 4835.199
can do really

4836.4 --> 4847.839999999999
without engaging on some kind of path

4838.639 --> 4847.84
that'll lead me to absolute destruction

4850.08 --> 4857.679
and who knows yeah how far

4854.32 --> 4861.84
this can go like what what i can do here

4857.679 --> 4861.84
with what i do

4864.48 --> 4869.28
unfortunately i'm always going to be

4866.0 --> 4872.8
bound by my financial maneuverability

4869.28 --> 4876.48
and at this moment it's not great

4872.8 --> 4878.56
so please do support me and my channel

4876.48 --> 4881.5199999999995
through the paypal patreon crypto

4878.56 --> 4889.84
wallets and the super chat

4881.52 --> 4889.84
it will improve the quality of what i do

4894.48 --> 4898.959999999999
consider how dimensions factor into the

4896.8 --> 4917.84
flat plane equation

4898.96 --> 4917.84
what wow

4922.639 --> 4927.76
yeah how i mean there are some factors

4926.4 --> 4931.199
at play in this realm

4927.76 --> 4933.76
like for example the celestial bodies

4931.199 --> 4935.678999999999
that are mysterious and hard to figure

4933.76 --> 4937.84
out

4935.679 --> 4939.6
from a third dimensional perspective as

4937.84 --> 4943.92
to try and back engineer it

4939.6 --> 4944.88
right but just because we can conceive

4943.92 --> 4948.4800000000005
of things

4944.88 --> 4950.8
from an otherly dimensional perspective

4948.48 --> 4954.08
in order to try and make sense of it

4950.8 --> 4957.28
doesn't mean that those other

4954.08 --> 4961.92
dimensions are thereby

4957.28 --> 4973.84
real it's just an attempt to

4961.92 --> 4973.84
bridge the gap of understanding

4975.04 --> 4981.76
yes aries 106 i am i am

4978.08 --> 4986.4
engaged in that through the gti company

4981.76 --> 4988.4800000000005
it's just not very quick

4986.4 --> 4989.5199999999995
but i've been doing that or been riding

4988.48 --> 4993.28
on to that

4989.52 --> 4995.6
for over five years there's something

4993.28 --> 4997.84
coming out of it it's just not really

4995.6 --> 5001.84
significant enough for me to really make

4997.84 --> 5001.84
a difference at this point

5007.6 --> 5012.159000000001
all right hey and if you want to try it

5009.28 --> 5015.84
out if you got some financial

5012.159 --> 5015.839999999999
investment room

5016.48 --> 5023.44
try me become part of it

5020.8 --> 5025.28
you know you'd be the first yeah the

5023.44 --> 5027.839999999999
first

5025.28 --> 5028.32
because for some reason i've i've tried

5027.84 --> 5031.28
to

5028.32 --> 5032.639
get other people in on the system

5031.28 --> 5036.5599999999995
everybody's always

5032.639 --> 5038.400000000001
no no no no no they're getting a lot of

5036.56 --> 5044.0
no's in the last five years

5038.4 --> 5046.48
a lot i don't get it i really don't

5044.0 --> 5048.48
i mean yeah i might not be the most

5046.48 --> 5051.36
financially

5048.48 --> 5051.678999999999
capable person out there does that mean

5051.36 --> 5054.96
that

5051.679 --> 5057.92
everything i do is an absolute hell hole

5054.96 --> 5060.159
financially so i've engaged in it so

5057.92 --> 5061.52
that means that if you do that it's a

5060.159 --> 5064.08
doom

5061.52 --> 5066.639
because i don't understand why i haven't

5064.08 --> 5071.84
been able to just

5066.639 --> 5071.84
get people hooked in this system

5071.92 --> 5075.2390000000005
there's a lot of hassle with it it's a

5074.32 --> 5078.239
lot of

5075.239 --> 5081.919999999999
reorganizing within it it's pretty big

5078.239 --> 5083.5199999999995
what they do makes it a little hard to

5081.92 --> 5085.76
oversee

5083.52 --> 5087.679
but they are building and they're

5085.76 --> 5089.92
building really

5087.679 --> 5090.88
for the long run all the time and that's

5089.92 --> 5093.04
probably why

5090.88 --> 5094.56
it's kind of slow because they're always

5093.04 --> 5098.4
building for the long run they're

5094.56 --> 5101.04
literally literally competing

5098.4 --> 5102.32
with the world bank okay they're

5101.04 --> 5105.04
effectively

5102.32 --> 5106.799999999999
trying to compete with the entire world

5105.04 --> 5109.84
banking system

5106.8 --> 5111.679
effectively it's just that

5109.84 --> 5113.28
the entire world banking system doesn't

5111.679 --> 5115.76
want them to

5113.28 --> 5115.759999999999
you get it

5124.4 --> 5128.96
and competing is a big word by the way

5126.239 --> 5131.28
it's it's just trying to completely stay

5128.96 --> 5134.08
out of it more

5131.28 --> 5135.12
to truly be independent and not just

5134.08 --> 5138.239
another

5135.12 --> 5141.84
machine hanging under their control

5138.239 --> 5141.839999999999
like almost everything else

5155.36 --> 5160.88
oh really my show hasn't changed in

5157.36 --> 5160.88
three years i'd like to differ

5163.199 --> 5167.12
i've changed i've changed the way that i

5165.679 --> 5170.159
interacted with my chat

5167.12 --> 5171.04
i've improved upon my psychoanalysis

5170.159 --> 5176.719
skills

5171.04 --> 5180.639
significantly more people know me

5176.719 --> 5185.199
i've introduced many concepts that are

5180.639 --> 5185.1990000000005
integrated now in the lore

5187.6 --> 5194.08
so yeah i beg to differ show has

5190.4 --> 5194.08
definitely changed in the last three

5194.84 --> 5197.84
years

5203.04 --> 5205.6
but hey

5206.8 --> 5213.76
why don't you try something else

5210.88 --> 5214.88
try another angle it to it tell me what

5213.76 --> 5217.84
i do is futile

5214.88 --> 5219.1990000000005
right because because i'm in the way of

5217.84 --> 5222.719
your glow belief

5219.199 --> 5225.759999999999
tell me come on just rocks come on

5222.719 --> 5229.12
tell me how it's futile come here

5225.76 --> 5239.84
to tell me that what i do is useless

5229.12 --> 5239.84
come on

5255.84 --> 5281.84
yeah that's a good advice clutch bear

5266.96 --> 5281.84
all right i'll be back in two minutes

5375.04 --> 5380.88
oh yeah jeff rocks

5378.08 --> 5380.88
get the [ __ ] out

5382.32 --> 5387.5199999999995
oh and howard moore yeah time for you to

5385.199 --> 5389.28
[ __ ] off too

5387.52 --> 5393.84
just waiting till you showed up so i

5389.28 --> 5393.84
could ban you scumbag

5414.48 --> 5421.839999999999
oh aries 106. that's exactly you mean

5446.84 --> 5449.84
good

5489.12 --> 5494.08
andrew lose anger how well by letting it

5491.84 --> 5494.08
go

5496.48 --> 5505.839999999999
prevent engaging let it go

5518.48 --> 5523.199
all right glad you're enjoying it chris

5520.48 --> 5523.199
la jumbe

5529.44 --> 5533.199
i got caught in the moment yeah andrew

5531.28 --> 5537.12
but that's how it always works

5533.199 --> 5538.4
the the trick is to feel out about

5537.12 --> 5542.0
yourself

5538.4 --> 5544.08
when you're getting bound and growing

5542.0 --> 5547.6
towards that point

5544.08 --> 5549.21
because once you actually bite

5547.6 --> 5550.88
and then start

5549.21 --> 5553.36
[Music]

5550.88 --> 5554.88
start yeah like a bulldog trying to

5553.36 --> 5557.12
choke it or rip it apart

5554.88 --> 5559.04
that's then it's already too late you

5557.12 --> 5562.159
have to spot it before

5559.04 --> 5565.28
that happens to see it coming to then

5562.159 --> 5568.879999999999
take another turn before it gets there

5565.28 --> 5568.88
that's the real trick how to do it

5571.199 --> 5576.159
oh well you [ __ ] off then too planet

5573.84 --> 5578.159000000001
earthlings come back

5576.159 --> 5580.5599999999995
yeah there's going to be a whole lot of

5578.159 --> 5580.5599999999995
people

5580.639 --> 5586.88
nagging nagging me

5583.92 --> 5588.2390000000005
every [ __ ] day for a long time and

5586.88 --> 5591.12
they're all out of here

5588.239 --> 5592.239
you're no longer welcome you can all go

5591.12 --> 5594.5599999999995
[ __ ] die

5592.239 --> 5597.04
take the vaccine and get the [ __ ] out of

5594.56 --> 5597.04
this world

5600.88 --> 5616.88
yeah and you turtled off you too you can

5604.239 --> 5619.839999999999
[ __ ] off too bye

5616.88 --> 5621.6
hello dutch sailor yeah you know what i

5619.84 --> 5622.719
should have done this [ __ ] a long time

5621.6 --> 5625.280000000001
ago

5622.719 --> 5626.56
i open up to ballers because i thought

5625.28 --> 5629.599999999999
there would be more

5626.56 --> 5632.56
back and forth interaction but

5629.6 --> 5634.639
every time in the last like two weeks

5632.56 --> 5636.159000000001
all that's happened is they come rolling

5634.639 --> 5639.04
in

5636.159 --> 5640.08
i kind of have to address their [ __ ] try

5639.04 --> 5642.0
to get to them

5640.08 --> 5644.32
and all and then the flat earth is the

5642.0 --> 5648.96
people that i actually care about

5644.32 --> 5648.96
they stay away because apparently

5649.12 --> 5654.96
they didn't come here to listen

5652.88 --> 5656.56
to more back and forth with nasty

5654.96 --> 5661.12
ballers and chat

5656.56 --> 5665.52
that was my mistake it's my mistake

5661.12 --> 5667.5199999999995
i thought that people would like that

5665.52 --> 5669.360000000001
i thought that the people that are

5667.52 --> 5670.639
following me would like that and i was

5669.36 --> 5672.88
wrong

5670.639 --> 5674.639
because you might want to like it but

5672.88 --> 5676.639
you don't because that's

5674.639 --> 5678.08
what rolled out every time these ballers

5676.639 --> 5680.96
come rolling in

5678.08 --> 5681.679
they completely out snow any other

5680.96 --> 5684.88
activity

5681.679 --> 5687.28
of you guys that actually contribute and

5684.88 --> 5690.159000000001
actually ask good questions

5687.28 --> 5691.199
and that are nice and that they're here

5690.159 --> 5693.199
to learn

5691.199 --> 5695.678999999999
so that's why i've just decided it's

5693.199 --> 5695.678999999999
it's over

5696.32 --> 5703.199
no more of that [ __ ] it's gone

5700.48 --> 5705.5199999999995
yeah they really loved it so much they

5703.199 --> 5708.48
should have supported me

5705.52 --> 5710.719
yeah if you like that space of having a

5708.48 --> 5712.879999999999
voice for your stupid baller opinions

5710.719 --> 5714.4
to a certain degree in my chat if you

5712.88 --> 5715.679
really had liked that you should have

5714.4 --> 5718.48
supported me

5715.679 --> 5720.0
but you didn't and now i'm at the brink

actually was gonna do so that was very

5825.36 --> 5841.839999999999
smart of you to pick up on that

5827.199 --> 5841.839999999999
and open up in chat like that

5869.52 --> 5876.88

5892.96 --> 5897.52

and you're broke okay well you better

5927.04 --> 5929.679
behave then

5935.84 --> 5941.52
use streamlabs 7.99 would go

5939.6 --> 5944.88
right to your paypal i don't know if it

5941.52 --> 5944.88
would foul language

5945.28 --> 5953.84
i'm live streaming on youtube

5968.4 --> 5981.839999999999
go [ __ ] yourself grimvy seriously

6071.6 --> 6083.119000000001
ah it's back what the hell

6079.44 --> 6083.119
that made no freaking sense

6083.84 --> 6088.8
it just turned off that was weird

6091.52 --> 6095.360000000001
now to get into the settings and

6093.04 --> 6098.88
basically reset the source that made no

6095.36 --> 6100.96
damn sense whatsoever thanks obs

6098.88 --> 6104.4800000000005
thanks for literally just being

6100.96 --> 6107.52
completely unstable and [ __ ]

6104.48 --> 6110.718999999999
thanks a lot thanks also for completely

6107.52 --> 6112.88
ruining the audio options where you

6110.719 --> 6121.84
can't even regulate the details anymore

6112.88 --> 6121.84
thanks a lot for that

6132.84 --> 6135.84
huh

6137.679 --> 6141.52
all right but foul and volcano i don't

6139.199 --> 6142.799999999999
know streamlabs is not it's not a

6141.52 --> 6146.8
separate platform

6142.8 --> 6149.76
as far as i know streamlabs is just a

6146.8 --> 6153.6
system to do live streams you still have

6149.76 --> 6153.6
to wire it into youtube though

6156.32 --> 6163.84
okay fine give you a wrench

6160.639 --> 6163.84
and we'll see

6192.96 --> 6196.08
you got the link yet

6197.76 --> 6200.08
right

6201.76 --> 6205.84
okay thanks check it out

6221.44 --> 6227.04
well leaping4j it's complicated

6224.719 --> 6230.56
do you get happiness knowing the truth

6227.04 --> 6230.56
is it better than not knowing

6230.84 --> 6235.92
uh it's just different

6237.679 --> 6242.8
in a way it is a great relief and you'll

6240.719 --> 6244.08
get a better grip on things but at the

6242.8 --> 6246.320000000001
same time it also

6244.08 --> 6247.44
might have a tendency to isolate you

6246.32 --> 6250.719
more

6247.44 --> 6261.839999999999
now if you can't handle that

6250.719 --> 6261.84
then it's going to be very tough

6262.239 --> 6267.119
using stream lab and linking to paypal

6270.0 --> 6274.08
to avoid taking their cut well there is

6272.8 --> 6275.84
a paypal link

6274.08 --> 6277.44
in the description box that's why i

6275.84 --> 6289.84
asked just donate to that

6277.44 --> 6289.839999999999
it'll work just fine

6300.84 --> 6303.84
hmm

6308.719 --> 6316.159
okay so streamlabs obs

6313.119 --> 6318.08
so is it obs or isn't it obs it's kind

6316.159 --> 6320.4
of confusing to me but anyway i am

6318.08 --> 6324.239
downloading it

6320.4 --> 6326.5599999999995
and i'll give it a look at least

6324.239 --> 6331.839999999999
because this regular obs is not really

6326.56 --> 6331.84
helping me

6347.44 --> 6351.5199999999995
that is kind of interesting though that

6349.119 --> 6353.759999999999
donations can be directly wired into a

6351.52 --> 6358.080000000001
certain system

6353.76 --> 6360.4800000000005
that is interesting

6358.08 --> 6361.5199999999995
yeah maybe i'll work on that maybe i

6360.48 --> 6373.839999999999
will do that

6361.52 --> 6373.84
thank you for the tip

6395.84 --> 6401.28
right that that sounds about right

6397.76 --> 6404.400000000001
leaping 4j

6401.28 --> 6415.84
elon musk developer did he

6404.4 --> 6415.839999999999
could be

6426.84 --> 6429.84
so

6432.56 --> 6443.84
and he is from south africa so

6435.679 --> 6443.84
so what

6456.4 --> 6471.839999999999
no i just ran out of tea

6482.84 --> 6485.84
um

6495.6 --> 6502.8
oh all right leaping 4j i

6499.36 --> 6503.44
appreciate that yes my mind races all

6502.8 --> 6506.0
the time

6503.44 --> 6507.199
literally all the time i i don't think

6506.0 --> 6510.4
slow ever

6507.199 --> 6510.4
haven't done that since

6510.88 --> 6513.84
very young

6517.119 --> 6527.839999999999
no dr gonzo you can get

6520.159 --> 6527.839999999999
out and stay out

6542.639 --> 6546.56
had tea time with gary and terry i still

6545.6 --> 6549.76
don't have to

6546.56 --> 6554.159000000001
a channel link for that

6549.76 --> 6557.280000000001
i've heard him heard big bear about it

6554.159 --> 6561.04
yeah nowadays i just follow the uploads

6557.28 --> 6561.04
on bit shoot mostly

6563.04 --> 6567.199
i have to say i don't follow him like

6565.199 --> 6569.598999999999
every day anymore i used to be

6567.199 --> 6571.44
doing that a lot during the live streams

6569.599 --> 6575.28
because i really appreciated

6571.44 --> 6575.28
the live interaction but yeah that's

6575.92 --> 6583.84
doesn't seem to be possible anymore

6592.639 --> 6598.32
all right yeah what does he use he

6595.679 --> 6598.32
uses some

6600.719 --> 6605.44
some site that i'm not a part of to do

6603.28 --> 6611.84
his live streams and then uploads them

6605.44 --> 6611.839999999999
other places that's it again whatever

6619.36 --> 6625.839999999999
yeah random explorer me too

6643.36 --> 6648.159
he streams live on youtube but where

6649.679 --> 6653.84
like somebody brought that up yesterday

6651.679 --> 6653.84
as well

6680.0 --> 6682.48
what the

6683.76 --> 6686.639
what just happened

6692.88 --> 6697.36
what did you see that

6697.599 --> 6703.92
that was weird like

6701.36 --> 6705.28
i blocked that [ __ ] and then google

6703.92 --> 6709.36
moderator

6705.28 --> 6714.4
see deleted by the google moderator team

6709.36 --> 6717.36
see that to the left of me on the screen

6714.4 --> 6717.36
that was weird

6718.0 --> 6724.96
so i removed him and then

6721.04 --> 6737.84
google moderator removed it double

6724.96 --> 6737.84
really weird

6751.28 --> 6756.48
they're on two guns oh are they

6754.639 --> 6758.32
or maybe they're doing something about

6756.48 --> 6762.239
sock accounts or something

6758.32 --> 6765.84
it's weird we're being watched i

6762.239 --> 6765.839999999999
i'm sure i am

6766.08 --> 6773.119
you know that i have a show i should be

6769.679 --> 6774.32
i should be watched it's just a little

6773.119 --> 6777.199
weird that google

6774.32 --> 6779.84
does this sort of thing now i've seen it

6777.199 --> 6779.839999999999
pop up before

6779.92 --> 6782.96
just like oh yeah i've i have a wrench

6782.639 --> 6784.96
i'm

6782.96 --> 6787.04
doing whatever and then just suddenly

6784.96 --> 6789.04
google just comes in and just like oh

6787.04 --> 6793.84
this is deleted by the google moderator

6789.04 --> 6793.84
team like what

6800.8 --> 6805.04
go they have your back you may not think

6803.599 --> 6807.04
so

6805.04 --> 6810.4
i don't know if they have my back but

6807.04 --> 6812.32
they implemented something

6810.4 --> 6814.239
i don't exactly know what the

6812.32 --> 6821.84
implications of that

6814.239 --> 6821.839999999999
thing the moderating that now happens is

6824.08 --> 6835.84
but that's there now

6852.8 --> 6858.96
i wonder though like do they only do

6856.4 --> 6861.44
this with live streams

6858.96 --> 6862.0
or are they actually retroactively

6861.44 --> 6864.159
digging

6862.0 --> 6865.04
through other videos and doing the same

6864.159 --> 6868.638999999999
thing i

6865.04 --> 6868.639
haven't really checked out yet

6869.92 --> 6874.159
besides like the chat replay the

6872.239 --> 6877.44
standard chat replay system

6874.159 --> 6880.719
is pretty poor

6877.44 --> 6883.36
to watch the chat back that's also part

6880.719 --> 6886.96
of the reason why i got it recorded

6883.36 --> 6887.36
on the very screen because the google

6886.96 --> 6892.719
chat

6887.36 --> 6892.719
is kind of unreliable for replays

6893.76 --> 6896.96
a lot of times when i watch back my own

6895.599 --> 6899.1990000000005
videos it's just like

6896.96 --> 6901.04
half of the people commenting they don't

6899.199 --> 6902.08
show up and then they have to constantly

6901.04 --> 6906.0
refresh because

6902.08 --> 6909.599
just things is incomplete

6906.0 --> 6909.599
it's very odd like that

6912.08 --> 6919.84
so chat replays on youtube are

6914.32 --> 6919.84
definitely not what they used to be

6928.48 --> 6935.598999999999
right clutch bear would you like to

6932.159 --> 6938.0
link me directly to the gary and terry

6935.599 --> 6938.0

6940.08 --> 6942.719
