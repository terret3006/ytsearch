feeling it too so I don't know how it

110.88 --> 117.63

114.84 --> 121.289
of flustered saying it's warm evening

117.63 --> 123.869
and you just um and yeah half of the

121.289 --> 131.45

Oh Amanda young Yabba

171.459 --> 176.019
yeah good to see you and yeah I was

174.64 --> 179.47
starting a little bit early on the

176.019 --> 184.269
Sunday so yeah of course people are

179.47 --> 186.12
gonna roll in a little late that doesn't

184.269 --> 195.15
mean that I need some account filler

186.12 --> 195.15
thank you very much hmm low point resume

197.11 --> 202.83
II mystical flu

208.43 --> 215.299
your main account well I'm not entirely

211.519 --> 221.56
sure what your main account is but I

215.299 --> 221.56
just don't appreciate people doing that

223.06 --> 229.959
but anyway look if you want to use

225.889 --> 233.209
channel Hugh's secret admirer that's I

229.959 --> 236.09
don't know I have no objection to a name

233.209 --> 241.03
like that if you're gonna have like

236.09 --> 241.03
creepy names I don't appreciate that

241.689 --> 251.06
secret admiration there's nothing creepy

244.22 --> 254.359
about that yeah he said he's a cousin

251.06 --> 260.979
Tino good morning Neil Robin Stanley of

254.359 --> 260.979
course good servant

263.68 --> 275.77
oh yeah by the way the church is still

269.29 --> 277.81
empty over there I I'm really somewhat

275.77 --> 280.9
disappointed I'd hoped that now that

277.81 --> 285.52
this official ban is supposedly over

280.9 --> 288.98999999999995
that yeah they would start coming again

285.52 --> 288.99
on Sunday but apparently not

299.87 --> 302.83
oh great

309.25 --> 317.19
right yeah predicted right and they make

313.54 --> 321.48
yeah like half of the rest of the world

317.19 --> 321.48
so welcome to the club

328.4 --> 334.76
and what I'm more curious that is the

331.04 --> 337.97
thing that I predicted two years ago and

334.76 --> 340.4
that was I was way too early but like

337.97 --> 343.19000000000005
when first situation with dream Trump

340.4 --> 346.01
and then give me alone got tense and all

343.19 --> 349.31
that remember that and then I put just

346.01 --> 351.05
down at some point I think like a pretty

349.31 --> 353.0
raw prediction I don't even know if I

351.05 --> 355.07
did it on my own channel because I was

353.0 --> 361.25
really nervous about it I definitely

355.07 --> 365.12
told people like yeah like it yeah I

361.25 --> 367.19
don't even want to say it but like I was

365.12 --> 369.889
quite surprised about this

367.19 --> 373.4
well bromance supposedly that happened

369.889 --> 376.07
after that like apparently in my mind or

373.4 --> 378.32
in my visions that part was skipped so

376.07 --> 382.21
yeah it's weird how that all works but I

378.32 --> 386.419
have seen certain things like unfold and

382.21 --> 391.69899999999996
it's just not not a pleasant thing

386.419 --> 394.94
overall but who knows you know I have

391.699 --> 398.12
hope that it was just simulation because

394.94 --> 403.21999999999997
that kind of thing also happened like in

398.12 --> 404.57
the dark world I did like try out what

403.22 --> 407.33000000000004
if simulations

404.57 --> 409.43
on several occasions and it might have

407.33 --> 412.76
been one of those so it might actually

409.43 --> 416.41
not happen at all so yeah kind of

412.76 --> 416.40999999999997
curious to just see how it unfolds

422.11 --> 429.66900000000004
using sun you hate science well maybe

426.22 --> 431.77000000000004
you should realize that they've even

429.669 --> 433.33
perverted the word and the meaning so

431.77 --> 435.28
they call things science it's not

433.33 --> 438.00899999999996
actually science it's a storytelling

435.28 --> 440.169
science fiction tradition based on

438.009 --> 444.099
moving away from the actual scientific

440.169 --> 447.00899999999996
method and yeah that's when you find out

444.099 --> 449.77
that it's all full of [ __ ] that's a real

447.009 --> 452.62
bummer and then you hate the word but

449.77 --> 454.719
the word is even stolen effectively you

452.62 --> 458.379
got to realize that and it's it's what

454.719 --> 462.19
the yeah extreme left tip and the

458.379 --> 464.53000000000003
Communists typically do they just as as

462.19 --> 469.18
a default control opposition mechanism

464.53 --> 472.78
they they take on the name or the cloak

469.18 --> 475.919
or the or an act of the spirit of the

472.78 --> 479.25
enemy they're taking out and then they

475.919 --> 483.25
represent it completely inside out and

479.25 --> 485.409
science has been affected mechanically

483.25 --> 488.61
like that and that's what the whole

485.409 --> 488.61
scientism cult is

493.65 --> 497.90999999999997
so yeah we already got a problem

504.11 --> 507.41
[Music]

523.969 --> 530.6700000000001
all right

526.32 --> 533.63
yeah when you approach situations even

530.67 --> 536.8499999999999
like the concept of pandemic through

533.63 --> 540.029
alternative approaches like say Germany

536.85 --> 542.7900000000001
medicine and yeah preponderance of

540.029 --> 546.529
research people that literally break

542.79 --> 552.259
away from the entire presupposed

546.529 --> 552.259
conception of diseases and all that and

554.06 --> 565.4399999999999
bacteria viruses what it really were how

557.22 --> 568.74
it really works then yeah it does become

565.44 --> 570.75
very predictable because it's just kind

568.74 --> 576.74
of clear to me it was for a long time

570.75 --> 579.42
just as a personal measuring stick that

576.74 --> 581.819
if there is a widespread outbreak it's

579.42 --> 584.67
because of combined factors that

581.819 --> 587.569
everybody shares and a lot of it has to

584.67 --> 591.209
do with stress psychology punishing

587.569 --> 593.99
situations abrupt changes emotional with

591.209 --> 596.8499999999999
emotional consequences if that's like

593.99 --> 599.97
collectively happening then it's going

596.85 --> 602.1
to trigger collective effects and if

599.97 --> 605.85
like the general food conditions

602.1 --> 608.85
sanitary conditions are not good during

605.85 --> 614.519
such times then suddenly everybody can

608.85 --> 617.8190000000001
have vivid disease responses and that is

614.519 --> 619.769
in reality how pandemics work and you

617.819 --> 624.209
could even argue that the toxicity of

619.769 --> 627.93
vaccinations kind of add to that

624.209 --> 629.7299999999999
toxicity response effect and then

627.93 --> 632.67
there's more complicated things involve

629.73 --> 638.089
the psychosomatic triggering effects and

632.67 --> 638.0889999999999
all that you know it's not really simple

639.72 --> 644.95
but it is kind of predictable especially

642.82 --> 647.8900000000001
when you realize that it's all about

644.95 --> 652.5400000000001
outside influences it's literally just

647.89 --> 659.29
the influences not a entity that's going

652.54 --> 661.39
around replicating it's the conditions

659.29 --> 662.5889999999999
it's always the conditions that cause

661.39 --> 664.42
these things and if you have

662.589 --> 669.2790000000001
foreknowledge then you can create a

664.42 --> 674.649
story based on an invasive invasion

669.279 --> 676.24
entity as it were to cover false with

674.649 --> 679.18
false reason as to why things are

676.24 --> 681.12
happening and yeah if people believe

679.18 --> 687.269
that if they're raised to believe that

681.12 --> 691.269
then yeah they forget the real causes of

687.269 --> 694.66
diseases and they've they've never even

691.269 --> 696.55
learned it you know at some point their

694.66 --> 698.41
grandparents might have hinted to it or

696.55 --> 700.54
something and then you probably started

698.41 --> 703.209
learning out what you read in school

700.54 --> 705.64
books it's what I did a lot it's like

703.209 --> 709.8699999999999
but I read in my biology this and that

705.64 --> 712.209
and I would be very frustrated that my

709.87 --> 716.41
parents would somehow insert some weird

712.209 --> 718.4799999999999
archaic sounding thing and now I realize

716.41 --> 722.01
in retrospect that that weird archaic

718.48 --> 725.769
sounding thing is just a kind of old

722.01 --> 730.18
fragile thing that is really a truth

725.769 --> 734.199
that is just being swept out of the way

730.18 --> 737.05
constantly with the with the yeah

734.199 --> 740.529
constantly reworked on programming for

737.05 --> 743.04
the general society that will deem it

740.529 --> 746.64
outdated because of the mindset

743.04 --> 749.64
migration of all the people constantly

746.64 --> 749.64
anyway

755.29 --> 761.0889999999999
Wow that was a bit of a complicated

757.639 --> 763.3
train of thought there it's funny how

761.089 --> 774.35
they sometimes just roll out of nothing

763.3 --> 781.8499999999999
hmm anyway yeah pandemics what is it

774.35 --> 784.399
really and yeah I have talked about it

781.85 --> 786.9390000000001
on this show even earlier when people

784.399 --> 791.81
were kind of pushing me yeah you have to

786.939 --> 794.24
explain Korona or like what is this

791.81 --> 796.6099999999999
Arwen did you hear about the thing in

794.24 --> 799.009
China and the media being hyped you

796.61 --> 801.8000000000001
think it's real that's how that started

799.009 --> 804.29
and I was just like oh wait yeah I got

801.8 --> 807.2299999999999
some very fringe information that I

804.29 --> 809.0
kinda wanted to share well I thought was

807.23 --> 813.009
kind of astounded that when I did that

809.0 --> 815.959
that it really unfolded everywhere else

813.009 --> 819.11
now I'm not saying that it that I was

815.959 --> 821.68
the cause but my timing was just

819.11 --> 821.6800000000001
excellent

824.39 --> 832.04
for that basically saying yeah maybe

827.589 --> 837.649
viruses aren't exactly viruses maybe

832.04 --> 838.3389999999999
their defense mechanism and yeah that

837.649 --> 846.829
was cool

838.339 --> 849.0500000000001
I meant I wonder with how many people

846.829 --> 852.519
around the world on average it has stuck

849.05 --> 856.6099999999999
because it is really something that you

852.519 --> 858.5
it is a school level thing that has been

856.61 --> 861.5
kind of skipped everywhere nobody's

858.5 --> 865.13
gotten that but you you got to be like

861.5 --> 867.14
good at school at all times or at the

865.13 --> 870.56
right moment in the right mindset to be

867.14 --> 872.5699999999999
able to absorb that you know because if

870.56 --> 875.149
you're completely preoccupied you're way

872.57 --> 877.07
too busy on your mind with oh I got to

875.149 --> 879.5
do this go to do that yeah you don't

877.07 --> 880.279
have the room in your head to like

879.5 --> 884.75
really

880.279 --> 888.769
teach yourself complicated things don't

884.75 --> 890.72
have the attention span but the funny

888.769 --> 894.14
thing in a way is that because of the

890.72 --> 897.1990000000001
the lockdown measures a lot of people

894.14 --> 899.209
have been kind of forced to step back

897.199 --> 901.579
from their tangle months in the world

899.209 --> 906.14
and that has kind of forced this extra

901.579 --> 910.3389999999999
rule now I'm sure that the elites the

906.14 --> 913.519
ones that actually apply these corona

910.339 --> 916.22
measures that they want to use that

913.519 --> 919.4590000000001
extra forced space in people's private

916.22 --> 921.47
lives to just pile on the programming of

919.459 --> 925.88
viruses and [ __ ] and pandemic and the

921.47 --> 928.279
new the new way of things just masks

925.88 --> 930.47
forever and all that [ __ ] you know and

928.279 --> 932.949
it's all trendy that's what they want to

930.47 --> 937.0400000000001
fill that up with but yeah if people

932.949 --> 939.5
already kind of were suspicious little

937.04 --> 942.4399999999999
about media input and all that and and

939.5 --> 944.42
CNN and whatever maybe they've already

942.44 --> 946.7600000000001
like heard of Alex Jones looked into him

944.42 --> 949.9699999999999
a little maybe not liked him but still

946.76 --> 953.6899999999999
like kept attention like wow he did have

949.97 --> 958.22
some point right well they might yeah

953.69 --> 961.73
now be just like unwilling to like

958.22 --> 964.19
no this is sick this really isn't good

961.73 --> 966.08
this is really about depopulation and

964.19 --> 968.12
Bill Gates is messed up we know that

966.08 --> 972.71
from the past is like flaunted it in

968.12 --> 977.42
everyone's face and yeah so they will

972.71 --> 980.0
seek out other things to learn about now

977.42 --> 981.9799999999999
of course a lot of will basically take

980.0 --> 984.05
her up on their professional knowledge

981.98 --> 987.13
because yeah YouTube is all filled with

984.05 --> 991.01
all these experts technical experts and

987.13 --> 992.9
yeah it's a great place to refresh in

991.01 --> 997.7
your technical knowledge of what you're

992.9 --> 999.91
doing but yeah so may also like take the

997.7 --> 1002.59
opportunity to kind of pick back up

999.91 --> 1004.2099999999999
fringe things they've been confronted

1002.59 --> 1006.01
with with the past and they needed to

1004.21 --> 1009.52
let it sink for a long time and maybe

1006.01 --> 1012.4
now it's like hmm you know what lockdown

1009.52 --> 1014.17
I'm not gonna watch that CNN [ __ ]

1012.4 --> 1016.36
all day long I'm just gonna watch these

1014.17 --> 1019.54
videos about their see what this really

1016.36 --> 1023.82
is and that's how new people roll into

1019.54 --> 1026.02
flat earth too and other conspiracy

1023.82 --> 1028.15
things you know and there's all these

1026.02 --> 1031.0
people out there like open arms like oh

1028.15 --> 1033.19
I have a lot of important information

1031.0 --> 1034.14
you have to stick to my channel at all

1033.19 --> 1037.21
time

1034.14 --> 1040.18
Alex Jones's and Joe Reubens and all

1037.21 --> 1042.8700000000001
that and you know every almost every one

1040.18 --> 1046.93
that's kind of has bigger channels

1042.87 --> 1050.1399999999999
they're all using the hypes from a

1046.93 --> 1053.47
counter perspective or or from a neutral

1050.14 --> 1055.96
perspective and it's like fishing

1053.47 --> 1057.76
fishing for attention and there's a lot

1055.96 --> 1060.8500000000001
of extra attention now out there

1057.76 --> 1065.14
available for people for that fishing to

1060.85 --> 1068.4399999999998
start well I'm just here doing my thing

1065.14 --> 1071.3500000000001
as always trying to stay consistent and

1068.44 --> 1074.3500000000001
hopefully yeah some people while looking

1071.35 --> 1078.58
around may actually pick up on me and

1074.35 --> 1085.4199999999998
maybe see like wait this is this is

1078.58 --> 1088.1499999999999
different this guy is like different

1085.42 --> 1092.39
why did what is he talking about what

1088.15 --> 1094.21
science what signs isn't real what does

1092.39 --> 1099.5300000000002
he mean hmm

1094.21 --> 1102.65
wait the realm orientation what the

1099.53 --> 1105.68
equator line being straight or Curt what

1102.65 --> 1109.01
is that you know what is it with looping

1105.68 --> 1111.0800000000002
space you know the wow that sounds like

1109.01 --> 1114.5
science fiction stuff but this guy is

1111.08 --> 1116.6599999999999
like saying it very serious and he's

1114.5 --> 1120.41
also sharing things about his life and

1116.66 --> 1123.23
he has mental problems or emotional

1120.41 --> 1131.5700000000002
problems but he's trying to deal with it

1123.23 --> 1134.15
and yeah maybe maybe I can kind of like

1131.57 --> 1137.78
help them and I even said yes they

1134.15 --> 1141.2900000000002
helped them pick back up things that I

1137.78 --> 1143.9289999999999
kind of let including personal problems

1141.29 --> 1145.79
you know a lot of people out there bury

1143.929 --> 1149.66
their personal problems because they are

1145.79 --> 1151.46
just overexposed with their

1149.66 --> 1155.929
preoccupation with the world and their

1151.46 --> 1158.27
careers or something and yeah personal

1155.929 --> 1161.8090000000002
problems getting buried tend to on

1158.27 --> 1165.32
average get worse over time so yeah good

1161.809 --> 1167.36
time also to work on that but realize

1165.32 --> 1172.01
that in a world where everything tries

1167.36 --> 1176.6
to mind-control you it's very tough to

1172.01 --> 1178.309
do that because everybody might disagree

1176.6 --> 1179.9289999999999
with that might be the problem that you

1178.309 --> 1182.57
just disagree with certain things and

1179.929 --> 1185.45
you don't know who to talk to because

1182.57 --> 1190.1599999999999
everybody's all set in their ways about

1185.45 --> 1192.98
it everybody's all become more and more

1190.16 --> 1195.0500000000002
politicized they got to have the opinion

1192.98 --> 1197.27
according to this system like that

1195.05 --> 1199.1299999999999
narrative and yeah it's not a good

1197.27 --> 1201.76
environment for you to work on your

1199.13 --> 1205.19
inner feelings and problems because it

1201.76 --> 1210.47
so you got to find the right people and

1205.19 --> 1212.15
then reflect and then see can you do

1210.47 --> 1215.59
something with this is this the right

1212.15 --> 1218.21
feel is this the right frequency maybe

1215.59 --> 1222.649
maybe pick back up on some

1218.21 --> 1226.22
old olds maybe even from very young age

1222.649 --> 1228.379
spiritual things that you kind of maybe

1226.22 --> 1230.24
also kind of put to the side because

1228.379 --> 1233.389
there are so many people supposedly

1230.24 --> 1236.09
talking about spirits and magic and it

1233.389 --> 1238.129
gets kind of pushy and aggressive and

1236.09 --> 1240.559
you feel manipulated you don't like that

1238.129 --> 1244.2199999999998
you just want to make sense of what

1240.559 --> 1247.48
you've experienced well that's also what

1244.22 --> 1247.48
I try to clear it up

1254.66 --> 1262.46
alright clarity clarity inside because

1258.35 --> 1266.9599999999998
when you gain more clarity over what's

1262.46 --> 1272.6000000000001
what's real what's happening why people

1266.96 --> 1275.54
do things what plants really do to

1272.6 --> 1277.3999999999999
people also and like where and the

1275.54 --> 1280.49
realization that a lot of people get

1277.4 --> 1282.47
into things not really realizing what

1280.49 --> 1284.42
the consequences are or what the info

1282.47 --> 1287.29
how the influence will change them they

1284.42 --> 1290.63
don't have naturally that oversight

1287.29 --> 1293.36
they're just too tied up or they're

1290.63 --> 1295.19
afraid to have it because then they

1293.36 --> 1296.84
would be confronted with the consequence

1295.19 --> 1301.0700000000002
and that wouldn't make it so easy for

1296.84 --> 1303.11
them to get to the place where they want

1301.07 --> 1304.97
to be because they yeah they're just

1303.11 --> 1306.9499999999998
obsessed with doing what they want and

1304.97 --> 1309.6100000000001
and they don't want to think about the

1306.95 --> 1309.6100000000001
consequences

1320.97 --> 1327.54
right so that's basically preoccupy

1325.56 --> 1333.4099999999999
myself a lot but just trying to

1327.54 --> 1337.26
understand the world and by doing that

1333.41 --> 1341.88
taking away any false notions that there

1337.26 --> 1348.06
is a reason to basically start attacking

1341.88 --> 1350.3400000000001
something because it's so easy to get

1348.06 --> 1357.3
caught up in something and just decide

1350.34 --> 1361.02
attack this know what Christ's method

1357.3 --> 1365.6399999999999
really showed is that attack is more

1361.02 --> 1369.3
about breaking a spell about changing

1365.64 --> 1372.3300000000002
the momentum but to destroy is not the

1369.3 --> 1377.34
Christ way no no no no conversion a way

1372.33 --> 1379.6499999999999
through the unseen solution for those

1377.34 --> 1381.81
that do not see the light that do not

1379.65 --> 1389.5700000000002
have enough light to oversee that there

1381.81 --> 1394.53
is the middle way through so don't get

1389.57 --> 1397.9199999999998
hellbound on attacking a singular thing

1394.53 --> 1402.99
and like really doubling down and like

1397.92 --> 1403.71
war mode but just realize what it is how

1402.99 --> 1411.15
it works

1403.71 --> 1413.94
and then figure out what will make it

1411.15 --> 1416.8500000000001
harmless and now the problem is the

1413.94 --> 1420.1200000000001
elite right the social engineers are

1416.85 --> 1424.1299999999999
experts at this and they try to use that

1420.12 --> 1426.8999999999999
way of thinking basically to re-engineer

1424.13 --> 1429.93
society to do exactly that with the

1426.9 --> 1433.2900000000002
people so that they will become harmless

1429.93 --> 1436.14
and not remove them to preoccupy them

1433.29 --> 1441.8999999999999
that's the better strategy to accomplish

1436.14 --> 1445.5
that but they can't take away it has to

1441.9 --> 1449.3700000000001
be voluntary that's how the mechanic

1445.5 --> 1453.66
works and so we can counter it by doing

1449.37 --> 1454.1789999999999
it ourselves by literally just seeing

1453.66 --> 1457.419
what

1454.179 --> 1463.24
real figuring out why it's there how

1457.419 --> 1465.789
it's happening and then figure out how

1463.24 --> 1468.159
could it change or where is it

1465.789 --> 1470.83
inevitably going how can you account for

1468.159 --> 1473.409
it all that planning it's like four

1470.83 --> 1476.259
dimensional planning and it is it can

1473.409 --> 1478.2990000000002
only work with true insight and if

1476.259 --> 1480.789
you're hell bound on a destruction of an

1478.299 --> 1483.6689999999999
element before then it's usually because

1480.789 --> 1485.169
you can't see your way around it and if

1483.669 --> 1486.8500000000001
you can't see a way around it that's

1485.169 --> 1492.0700000000002
usually because you don't have enough

1486.85 --> 1495.759
oversight to see the way through you

1492.07 --> 1498.85
know it's like think about it if you

1495.759 --> 1503.049
take away grievances and not saying that

1498.85 --> 1504.85
we should just blatantly blankly forgive

1503.049 --> 1508.08
everything you know personal grievances

1504.85 --> 1511.4989999999998
are personal grievances but if you just

1508.08 --> 1513.97
university see like two groups and

1511.499 --> 1516.6100000000001
they're like enemies and they've heard

1513.97 --> 1518.259
it it's like even Wars [ __ ] like yeah

1516.61 --> 1523.4189999999999
they're always gonna hurt they're gonna

1518.259 --> 1526.45
keep it going but if certain inspired

1523.419 --> 1530.289
people in one group or both figure out

1526.45 --> 1533.919
like wait we may be faced with other

1530.289 --> 1542.379
situations that are in the future if we

1533.919 --> 1543.8200000000002
can forget are our hostilities and that

1542.379 --> 1545.769
that's going on that that's gonna keep

1543.82 --> 1549.9399999999998
on going for a while and just figure out

1545.769 --> 1552.85
how to move past it then we may still be

1549.94 --> 1555.539
somewhat friends or like careful friends

1552.85 --> 1559.4189999999999
we could gradually grow a friendship and

1555.539 --> 1562.72
then be two friends not unite as one you

1559.419 --> 1567.009
know that you don't have to do that you

1562.72 --> 1568.24
can be friends friends with the past can

1567.009 --> 1570.549
be the best of friends

1568.24 --> 1572.619
this works for people you know people

1570.549 --> 1573.97
could have been in pretty hateful fights

1572.619 --> 1577.059
of words one nerd but then when they

1573.97 --> 1578.6490000000001
figure it out and they mend it and they

1577.059 --> 1580.36
realized that there's qualities about

1578.649 --> 1583.149
each other that they don't want to let

1580.36 --> 1585.3999999999999
lose that they can deal with it then

1583.149 --> 1588.7199999999998
they can become extremely strong friends

1585.4 --> 1595.21
well the same goes for societies

1588.72 --> 1600.64
therefore groups but you've got to be

1595.21 --> 1608.22
able to imagine the perceived opposition

1600.64 --> 1611.7700000000002
or opponent or enemy to have a function

1608.22 --> 1615.25
it sounds really complicated when we

1611.77 --> 1618.7
face certain things out there you know

1615.25 --> 1622.21
very it's like it it's an impossibility

1618.7 --> 1624.8400000000001
of us that yeah that's something that I

1622.21 --> 1629.41
face is like yeah

1624.84 --> 1632.8799999999999
Christ method you know can't figure it

1629.41 --> 1636.49
out though so yeah

1632.88 --> 1639.7600000000002
when things I'm adamantly opposed the

1636.49 --> 1641.5
principle so badly then yeah there is no

1639.76 --> 1645.16
middle way through because they destroy

1641.5 --> 1648.45
that middle way and they even realize it

1645.16 --> 1648.45
that's a bit of a problem

1662.6 --> 1674.289
okay anyway it's my rant for today hello

1671.96 --> 1674.289
Roger

1678.3 --> 1684.6499999999999
found my youtube channel so how were you

1681.36 --> 1684.6499999999999
looking for me

1701.86 --> 1709.49
all right through Nathan oh please okay

1705.149 --> 1712.6799999999998
cool well welcome to the channel

1709.49 --> 1712.68
[Music]

1719.619 --> 1725.059
well George Sanford I don't know man

1722.359 --> 1729.339
it's a little complicated to say nobody

1725.059 --> 1732.4089999999999
ever dies from a cold look it's like I

1729.339 --> 1735.799
don't know maybe slightly out of my

1732.409 --> 1738.769
league but I feel almost it's like an

1735.799 --> 1742.579
asthma attack you know I can have asthma

1738.769 --> 1744.769
you don't necessarily die from it it

1742.579 --> 1749.859
could be possible if like the compacted

1744.769 --> 1749.859
circumstances just make it too much see

1749.919 --> 1760.5790000000002
because it's a mechanism it's not an

1754.879 --> 1762.529
entity that invades you and then yeah

1760.579 --> 1766.479
takes you over destroys you or something

1762.529 --> 1766.479
no no no it's a mechanic mechanic

1776.44 --> 1785.43
even the common flu can kill yeah I know

1780.99 --> 1785.43
yeah a lot of things can kill you

1788.86 --> 1794.139
especially if you're weak you know that

1791.299 --> 1796.58
if you're weakened for some reason or

1794.139 --> 1800.5089999999998
preponderance of reasons that's how it

1796.58 --> 1803.049
works that's by a thousand cuts yeah you

1800.509 --> 1803.049
could call it that

1818.78 --> 1821.98
[Music]

1823.1 --> 1827.9699999999998
right and technically if you're going to

1825.99 --> 1832.35
compare it to that right a thousand cuts

1827.97 --> 1836.73
it's not the cuts that kills those it's

1832.35 --> 1839.9099999999999
the loss of blood every local blood

1836.73 --> 1842.58
pressure loss every part yeah that's the

1839.91 --> 1847.46
thing that then kill it's not any of the

1842.58 --> 1851.4399999999998
cuts it's a loss of blood blood pressure

1847.46 --> 1854.569
from the container being leaked

1851.44 --> 1854.569
[Music]

1861.99 --> 1870.96
[Music]

1892.999 --> 1899.3500000000001
no you have a no it didn't

1895.869 --> 1903.9499999999998
there is no proof of filled up

1899.35 --> 1907.33
Kovac 19 words I've never seen it and

1903.95 --> 1907.3300000000002
they did videos from China

1923.11 --> 1926.1899999999998
enemies can

1931.73 --> 1937.7
seem good enough no no no it's it's

1934.76 --> 1945.56
about just seeing the videos or not

1937.7 --> 1950.5900000000001
seeing them like just shots shot shot

1945.56 --> 1953.75
shot of people in like er situations

1950.59 --> 1956.8999999999999
that's not proof that they are Kovac

1953.75 --> 1960.89
that it's a covert kovat situation no

1956.9 --> 1964.5700000000002
that's it's just a suggestion it's no

1960.89 --> 1964.5700000000002
proper proof or any of that

1982.44 --> 1989.1000000000001
yeah bandsaw bandit the Aiea yeah they

1985.35 --> 1993.7199999999998
don't like it no because you keep

1989.1 --> 1995.79
doubling down on a mistake then yeah you

1993.72 --> 1997.92
become the mistake and then the mistake

1995.79 --> 2000.8
becomes you and then yeah you become a

1997.92 --> 2008.66
perpetuation of the mistake that you

2000.8 --> 2010.6399999999999
hold onto so you keep doing that the

2008.66 --> 2012.71
only real thing you need to do when

2010.64 --> 2016.8700000000001
you're stuck like that is just let it go

2012.71 --> 2022.3400000000001
just move on

2016.87 --> 2025.9399999999998
like if it's so important then why do

2022.34 --> 2028.58
you need to reaffirm your beliefs by

2025.94 --> 2031.0700000000002
going around them other people's

2028.58 --> 2038.21
businesses and getting in their face to

2031.07 --> 2040.97
reassert it what is that you know the

2038.21 --> 2044.72
only good comparison societally that I

2040.97 --> 2047.3
can think of is kind of like religious

2044.72 --> 2053.75
behavior getting in people's face and

2047.3 --> 2055.34
then yeah asserting your belief when

2053.75 --> 2058.37
they don't really want to talk about

2055.34 --> 2063.53
that they're preoccupied with something

2058.37 --> 2066.44
else now of course a this also happens

2063.53 --> 2068.09
with some flat-earthers but it's all at

2066.44 --> 2069.86
an art of the timing because yeah if

2068.09 --> 2074.98
people literally don't want to talk

2069.86 --> 2078.11
about it then it's no use bringing it up

2074.98 --> 2081.35
but a plenty of people out there will

2078.11 --> 2084.44
absolutely sister shoot in a standard

2081.35 --> 2087.7999999999997
defense mode and even if they're not

2084.44 --> 2096.159
really all into that because it's

2087.8 --> 2096.159
pre-program so yeah bit of a comparison

2096.8 --> 2102.36
humanity's full of these mechanisms and

2099.24 --> 2103.47
pre-programmed responses it's part of

2102.36 --> 2105.78
our identity

2103.47 --> 2107.2799999999997
it's just slipped in there and we just

2105.78 --> 2110.34
get used to it

2107.28 --> 2112.17
and we think that that is us that that

2110.34 --> 2116.88
is our opinion because we haven't

2112.17 --> 2119.28
thought about it more deeply you just

2116.88 --> 2124.53
trusted what you read or what you've

2119.28 --> 2131.9
been told now you've got to figure it

2124.53 --> 2135.9500000000003
out there's no easy path to knowledge

2131.9 --> 2137.94
just reading stuff alone is not enough

2135.95 --> 2141.0499999999997
memorizing things is not enough know

2137.94 --> 2147.48
you've got to figure out what it is

2141.05 --> 2152.34
what is real what is not and why why why

2147.48 --> 2155.16
is this thing in there in the book why

2152.34 --> 2159.9300000000003
is that not real and why are these other

2155.16 --> 2162.8399999999997
things why are they real and then then

2159.93 --> 2164.6099999999997
you start to really understand the

2162.84 --> 2167.3700000000003
knowledge all of a sudden then it gets a

2164.61 --> 2169.32
depth then it gets a context and then

2167.37 --> 2174.48
you really start to see what's going on

2169.32 --> 2177.4500000000003
welcome to the real world but yeah it's

2174.48 --> 2179.67
tough to get there sometimes it's

2177.45 --> 2184.56
straining it's strenuous

2179.67 --> 2187.17
stressful to awaken to take the blinders

2184.56 --> 2190.04
off its blinding it hurts kind of you

2187.17 --> 2190.04
got to get used to it

2194.24 --> 2198.1299999999997
yes Roger I am Dutch

2218.45 --> 2223.5589999999997
people don't often believe in viruses

2221.13 --> 2228.0190000000002
until they get one or you mean until

2223.559 --> 2232.049
somebody told them that they got one

2228.019 --> 2234.7189999999996
after they asked doctor what do I have I

2232.049 --> 2236.91
feel this and it and that and then the

2234.719 --> 2238.92
doctor tells them hmm wait there's this

2236.91 --> 2242.1299999999997
virus going around and these symptoms

2238.92 --> 2245.339
kind of some of them correlate and then

2242.13 --> 2249.3900000000003
yeah if you believe that story yeah

2245.339 --> 2251.819
oh you never believed in it until you

2249.39 --> 2254.989
were convinced you got one that's right

2251.819 --> 2254.989
that's how it works

2264.22 --> 2268.29
oh you from the Netherlands Roger I

2270.96 --> 2278.069
don't know I think there's still plenty

2273.25 --> 2281.65
of Dutch people that have like animal

2278.069 --> 2285.31
need for truth this there is still some

2281.65 --> 2287.7400000000002
flame of honour going around but yeah so

2285.31 --> 2288.43
many people that are getting like that

2287.74 --> 2291.79
are really

2288.43 --> 2294.96
I don't know elbowing for the attention

2291.79 --> 2299.68
a lot of them are like partially Grabel

2294.96 --> 2307.03
and not like really sick grab it's just

2299.68 --> 2309.46
like that the Dutch type like it's hard

2307.03 --> 2313.75
to describe it's like trying to hold it

2309.46 --> 2316.45
together realizing it's very tough for

2313.75 --> 2320.65
everyone so still I know I do it in my

2316.45 --> 2323.6699999999996
own way but I just I do it as little as

2320.65 --> 2326.53
possible and as consistently as possible

2323.67 --> 2328.869
right a lot of Dutch people take it very

2326.53 --> 2333.88
far they allow a lot of people a lot of

2328.869 --> 2336.849
fantasies and they still try to uphold

2333.88 --> 2340.119
the right spirit in a way but yeah so

2336.849 --> 2345.369
much squirting effectively comes still

2340.119 --> 2348.4900000000002
out of that but yeah there's I don't

2345.369 --> 2350.98
know I haven't really dug around too

2348.49 --> 2353.68
much I bet like the Netherlands is full

2350.98 --> 2355.869
of hundreds of people that have their

2353.68 --> 2359.77
shows and stuff and and I don't really

2355.869 --> 2362.26
listen to be fair I have listened to

2359.77 --> 2364.3
some shows like even my dad at one point

2362.26 --> 2367.21
said like oh you got to listen to this

2364.3 --> 2369.849
it's Dutch it's like this radio show and

2367.21 --> 2375.4
they talk about aliens - now listen to

2369.849 --> 2379.78
it and you know just it was like ah this

2375.4 --> 2382.42
is so squirty it's terrible and they

2379.78 --> 2388.78
didn't mean bad but it was just so scary

2382.42 --> 2390.58
it was choking me like a secret and it's

2388.78 --> 2394.63
all extreme and

2390.58 --> 2394.81
it was to squirty and yeah that puts me

2394.63 --> 2400.8900000000003
off

2394.81 --> 2406.95
I like the old-fashioned like cleared up

2400.89 --> 2406.95
calm thinking type of touch

2412.46 --> 2416.18
and and there's still some of them out

2414.349 --> 2419.0
there there's like some like older

2416.18 --> 2422.27
gentleman that kind of do that in some

2419.0 --> 2423.95
shows it's interesting so yeah I haven't

2422.27 --> 2427.64
completely given up hope for the

2423.95 --> 2430.0699999999997
Netherlands yet and to be fair I haven't

2427.64 --> 2433.339
really given it all a fair shot because

2430.07 --> 2436.42
I my focus is just more aimed at the

2433.339 --> 2436.42
trans-atlantic s--

2448.01 --> 2455.6600000000003
aliens yeah yeah but look Roger and look

2451.91 --> 2459.3199999999997
aliens man holy [ __ ] and now I'm not

2455.66 --> 2462.71
talking about alien coming from UFOs

2459.32 --> 2466.1600000000003
from outer space type of aliens no it's

2462.71 --> 2469.27
not over yet man there's also just

2466.16 --> 2470.8689999999997
entities interdimensional entities

2469.27 --> 2473.75
recognizes aliens

2470.869 --> 2478.8500000000004
sighting of aliens envision experiences

2473.75 --> 2481.52
in dreams yeah that's a way to talk

2478.85 --> 2485.69
about it as well like the phenomenon of

2481.52 --> 2487.67
it you know but yeah when you do that

2485.69 --> 2492.38
you do get up caught up in a lot of

2487.67 --> 2494.84
fantasy squirting so but there is

2492.38 --> 2502.7000000000003
something about that still and like even

2494.84 --> 2506.3
my healer basically still considers it

2502.7 --> 2509.71
like that but he sees it as like well

2506.3 --> 2511.8500000000004
spiritual aliens like from another

2509.71 --> 2514.48
interdimensional frequency as it were

2511.85 --> 2514.48
it's yeah

2523.589 --> 2530.969
oh yeah Roche oh god yeah I read that

2527.209 --> 2533.009
yeah I think he should pay that out of

2530.969 --> 2539.7290000000003
his own pocket and then shove all those

2533.009 --> 2543.989
vaccines up his ass like serious like no

2539.729 --> 2546.8999999999996
I don't want Dutch tax money and that

2543.989 --> 2548.369
much you know it open like everything's

2546.9 --> 2551.4590000000003
been all you got to cut the L you get

2548.369 --> 2554.759
that and then just giant pile of money

2551.459 --> 2558.049
on chemical waste for a [ __ ] no no

2554.759 --> 2561.569
no no no no they'll cancel that order

2558.049 --> 2565.199
literally just I don't care if you need

2561.569 --> 2569.4
to freaking Hackett pack it break it no

2565.199 --> 2573.349
no order no money transfer nothing no

2569.4 --> 2573.349
you're not gonna do that it's [ __ ]

2575.959 --> 2582.359
you know just whatever man somebody

2579.509 --> 2584.339
reroute the people that are making these

2582.359 --> 2587.069
decisions just reroute it from their

2584.339 --> 2590.91
foreign hidden bank accounts into the

2587.069 --> 2593.369
tax coffers just do that or something

2590.91 --> 2598.259
you know it's I'm serious

2593.369 --> 2604.13
I mean I this is just disgusting like we

2598.259 --> 2604.13
are they have yeah

2609.17 --> 2613.359
no it was more as like a billion

2624.54 --> 2634.23
yeah

2627.03 --> 2640.77
it's a billion so let's just make sure

2634.23 --> 2641.84
this doesn't happen it's I don't know

2640.77 --> 2645.9
man

2641.84 --> 2649.55
it's just my my visceral responses like

2645.9 --> 2652.38
these people just need to be deported

2649.55 --> 2654.48
just take away their touch citizen and

2652.38 --> 2657.7200000000003
just say yeah you're out of here don't

2654.48 --> 2660.48
come back but yeah that doesn't make any

2657.72 --> 2662.79
proper sense of course but that's my

2660.48 --> 2666.89
feeling about it like piss the hell off

2662.79 --> 2670.17
who the hell are you to decide a billion

2666.89 --> 2672.95
freakin euros for this [ __ ] doesn't

2670.17 --> 2672.9500000000003
even exist

2690.26 --> 2698.15
I know O'Shea in Dutch is always well

2695.72 --> 2700.7
yeah it's always pronounced in the

2698.15 --> 2705.9100000000003
French way unless you're like English or

2700.7 --> 2705.91
an American so

2727.45 --> 2730.45
what

2738.96 --> 2743.15
he powerful fanboy hello

2753.11 --> 2760.06
now Roger I didn't even see it I don't

2756.11 --> 2760.06
want to see it I just wanted to stop

2774.41 --> 2778.69
are you talking about he have

2781.75 --> 2789.49
oh that nonsense please

2785.849 --> 2794.05
it's this is just a red dwarf episode

2789.49 --> 2798.2999999999997
man you don't want to know what he was

2794.05 --> 2798.3
doing in that Bush is there okay

2811.46 --> 2817.51
no that was not what I was freakin

2813.92 --> 2820.16
talking about is this not your stupid

2817.51 --> 2824.1090000000004
mechanical physical parallel universe

2820.16 --> 2827.18
yet I'm talking about another level

2824.109 --> 2830.119
non-physical the non-physical realm

2827.18 --> 2836.96
parallel to this one spiritual realm its

2830.119 --> 2841.1600000000003
non-physical it's not Material its

2836.96 --> 2843.4700000000003
spiritual you know some may like to call

2841.16 --> 2847.39
it the ether that are not necessarily

2843.47 --> 2847.39
about physics

2857.08 --> 2863.62
now from everything I've learned this

2860.37 --> 2868.42
physical realm is the only physical

2863.62 --> 2872.5299999999997
realm now there may be more space within

2868.42 --> 2881.4
the physical realm beside us or even

2872.53 --> 2885.46
below us but it is the only realm as is

2881.4 --> 2888.15
or that we as entities in our living

2885.46 --> 2891.13
bodies could ever reach who knows man

2888.15 --> 2893.89
it's like yeah if you think about it if

2891.13 --> 2895.54
you take it for granted the spiritual

2893.89 --> 2898.0899999999997
realm and the experience that I've had

2895.54 --> 2901.18
then one could consider even that

2898.09 --> 2903.4
there's other living realms out there

2901.18 --> 2906.85
but there it's physically impossible to

2903.4 --> 2910.69
get there I don't know unless there's

2906.85 --> 2914.77
some freaking weird portal [ __ ] going on

2910.69 --> 2916.63
or something but I don't know yeah this

2914.77 --> 2919.59
starts this becomes real science

2916.63 --> 2919.59
fictiony at this point

2926.9 --> 2934.48
and and who knows man look especially if

2931.67 --> 2937.4300000000003
you consider the the possibility of

2934.48 --> 2940.789
looping nature within within the realm

2937.43 --> 2944.72
confine that we know yeah if the loop is

2940.789 --> 2947.21
possible then who knows the speciality

2944.72 --> 2953.99
of the realm itself could even at times

2947.21 --> 2956.569
interconnect you know like the space

2953.99 --> 2959.089
itself just where before it just

2956.569 --> 2963.319
continues on into the loop suddenly it

2959.089 --> 2965.15
just and it doesn't loop in the original

2963.319 --> 2967.369
way anywhere instead it just literally

2965.15 --> 2972.25
starts interconnecting with another

2967.369 --> 2975.7000000000003
realm yeah

2972.25 --> 2978.74
now that's science fiction right but I

2975.7 --> 2984.109
don't know I can imagine it based on on

2978.74 --> 2986.5389999999998
my model conceptions and therefore yeah

2984.109 --> 2989.75
it would be like oh you're going here we

2986.539 --> 2993.44
go north oh there's the the the mountain

2989.75 --> 2995.599
range then you go and then oh wait yeah

2993.44 --> 2997.579
we're back it's the mountain range we

2995.599 --> 2999.6800000000003
just came through we're back okay and

2997.579 --> 3000.849
then in other years like yeah the

2999.68 --> 3002.6189999999997
mountain range you were going through

3000.849 --> 3005.6800000000003
that right and then it's suddenly like

3002.619 --> 3010.569
what there's no memory what's this

3005.68 --> 3014.94
there's an island with the rivers and

3010.569 --> 3018.339
what how is that there suddenly right

3014.94 --> 3021.039
you almost get the feel of the legend of

3018.339 --> 3024.52
Arthur and in the the hidden realm there

3021.039 --> 3027.69
well yeah if suddenly this space reality

3024.52 --> 3032.559
a part of the realm would just suddenly

3027.69 --> 3036.789
interconnect like click where before it

3032.559 --> 3044.5
went on to the other part suddenly tick

3036.789 --> 3045.1800000000003
there is other space in between could be

3044.5 --> 3048.22
a thing

3045.18 --> 3052.089
look the realm could be incredibly

3048.22 --> 3054.9399999999996
surreal it's just not surreal in the

3052.089 --> 3057.43
heliocentric treant heliocentric globe

3054.94 --> 3060.539
conception kind of way doesn't mean that

3057.43 --> 3060.5389999999998
is not freaking surreal

3069.99 --> 3076.3799999999997
anyway

3071.2 --> 3076.3799999999997
I hope you guys think that's interesting

3083.23 --> 3087.659
[Music]

3091.58 --> 3099.159
[Music]

3104.31 --> 3115.71
now acaba don't don't go there man

3107.7 --> 3117.5099999999998
not on Sunday buddy but you're saying

3115.71 --> 3120.21
now you don't know how that is all

3117.51 --> 3122.07
established can just call it a bunch of

3120.21 --> 3128.67
goat herders you don't even know where

3122.07 --> 3136.8300000000004
it came from it could be a massive

3128.67 --> 3139.35
legend handed down and reformed at

3136.83 --> 3142.58
several generations it's just an ancient

3139.35 --> 3145.56
tradition if that is what it could be

3142.58 --> 3147.39
it's not just like a bunch of goat

3145.56 --> 3151.34
herders just so one day thought yeah

3147.39 --> 3155.49
let's make this [ __ ] up no that's never

3151.34 --> 3159.7200000000003
what it's gonna be it's too much for

3155.49 --> 3163.35
that and if it was that then what they

3159.72 --> 3165.3599999999997
originally made up is just a little

3163.35 --> 3170.12
story compared to everything that's

3165.36 --> 3170.1200000000003
built on top of that if that is the case

3180.84 --> 3192.8700000000003
yeah I'm sure it is you have a yeah you

3189.96 --> 3195.75
see but the thing is religion is like a

3192.87 --> 3198.15
mechanic it is an effect people get

3195.75 --> 3201.6
subjected to it as a system it spreads

3198.15 --> 3208.2000000000003
it develops right that doesn't make the

3201.6 --> 3213.0
content wrong is that something you

3208.2 --> 3214.47
could tackle me just because something

3213.0 --> 3221.1
is a religion doesn't mean it's wrong

3214.47 --> 3223.74
it's wrong when it's wrong and then

3221.1 --> 3225.69
doubling down on that error could

3223.74 --> 3227.5499999999997
definitely be considered religious

3225.69 --> 3229.65
behavior because it's the religion that

3227.55 --> 3235.77
motivates the person to keep doubling

3229.65 --> 3239.58
down that's different as to yeah when

3235.77 --> 3242.07
information is spread through religion

3239.58 --> 3245.16
but that information could absolutely be

3242.07 --> 3248.94
correct even though the mechanics in

3245.16 --> 3252.41
which it is absorbed has become a part

3248.94 --> 3255.42
of those mechanics could be not really

3252.41 --> 3258.48
coinciding with that law you know that's

3255.42 --> 3261.7200000000003
why the freaking Bible with Jesus in it

3258.48 --> 3264.57
telling you yeah organized religion not

3261.72 --> 3269.2799999999997
a good idea in the biggest organized

3264.57 --> 3272.4300000000003
religion in the world okay but that

3269.28 --> 3279.03
doesn't make Christ and what he said

3272.43 --> 3284.79
wrong okay he said that you get it habit

3279.03 --> 3288.65
see your objection that was Christ's

3284.79 --> 3288.65
objection do you understand that

3288.98 --> 3296.87
you just gave it another shape you let

3293.58 --> 3296.87
it pull you away

3300.19 --> 3303.329
[Music]

3304.05 --> 3310.27
it's about the information it's about

3306.79 --> 3315.64
the frequency it's not about the

3310.27 --> 3321.58
location in a web webchange

3315.64 --> 3328.66
systems change borders change people

3321.58 --> 3333.27
change but information and if it is true

3328.66 --> 3333.27
or if it is not true it does not change

3357.16 --> 3362.99
all right well have a look even in the

3360.47 --> 3365.8999999999996
oldest pagan tradition yeah that's how

3362.99 --> 3369.2299999999996
it worked you give a story the story is

3365.9 --> 3373.2200000000003
basically to amuse at first Hamas young

3369.23 --> 3376.22
story and then you hide information in

3373.22 --> 3380.1189999999997
that story that as the person gets older

3376.22 --> 3381.98
gets more senses awakens to elements of

3380.119 --> 3385.2200000000003
themselves then they recognize those

3381.98 --> 3387.7400000000002
elements in the story yeah that's that's

3385.22 --> 3391.609
a good story that's really the art of

3387.74 --> 3395.019
the story telling tradition of the old

3391.609 --> 3401.3489999999997
ways of passing down knowledge before

3395.019 --> 3401.3489999999997
writing became more of a default yeah

3409.87 --> 3417.19
but yeah it's a system it's just a

3412.76 --> 3421.8500000000004
system of passing on and wielding in

3417.19 --> 3425.39
yeah information to make sure that the

3421.85 --> 3427.52
teaching stick even though the person

3425.39 --> 3430.42
may not have full realization of what

3427.52 --> 3430.42
that encompasses

3435.05 --> 3441.86
and it has an important function too

3438.38 --> 3444.59
because practically control freaks and

3441.86 --> 3448.1600000000003
Psychopaths they when they make moves

3444.59 --> 3450.98
when they get a grip and hopefully yeah

3448.16 --> 3453.56
well you know they go after the really

3450.98 --> 3458.06
smart people because they understand

3453.56 --> 3460.16
what it all means so yeah if it is

3458.06 --> 3462.11
purely dependent on these smart people

3460.16 --> 3464.39
having the oversight and they take that

3462.11 --> 3466.13
away then it's lost forever but if you

3464.39 --> 3469.43
have a good story that contains that

3466.13 --> 3471.35
knowledge then it can be passed on by

3469.43 --> 3474.44
the people that have less understanding

3471.35 --> 3477.02
and then later a new person could awaken

3474.44 --> 3480.8
and once again attain that full

3477.02 --> 3485.09
oversight and it's safer and then see

3480.8 --> 3487.94
and then it can be explained again then

3485.09 --> 3497.48
insights deeper into it can be revealed

3487.94 --> 3503.63
again by that person see that's how you

3497.48 --> 3506.08
retain knowledge through the darkest of

3503.63 --> 3506.08
periods

3509.12 --> 3512.25
[Music]

3518.61 --> 3525.289
[Music]

3536.88 --> 3539.839
oh great

3554.819 --> 3560.239
all right going for an hour

3574.22 --> 3577.2999999999997
[Music]

3584.38 --> 3589.0190000000002
no mr. Koh that's not history at all

3592.91 --> 3599.75
fables and stories no no real history is

3596.59 --> 3603.4100000000003
is a collection of stories and then the

3599.75 --> 3606.95
testing of those stories how real is

3603.41 --> 3609.98
this how tested is this part in this

3606.95 --> 3612.8599999999997
book of something that was written down

3609.98 --> 3615.65
because yeah even people in history they

3612.86 --> 3618.8900000000003
lied and sometimes entire things have

3615.65 --> 3620.78
been lit retrospectively been proven to

3618.89 --> 3623.93
be lies by comparing it

3620.78 --> 3626.0600000000004
cross-referencing it to history written

3623.93 --> 3632.6299999999997
down in another country not affected by

3626.06 --> 3639.98
that situation see the history it's not

3632.63 --> 3642.98
yeah history is like a discipline it's

3639.98 --> 3646.4
like getting all the information and

3642.98 --> 3649.82
then it's testing what is real and keep

3646.4 --> 3655.64
testing it until everything is revealed

3649.82 --> 3657.59
and but yeah it's it's safe to say

3655.64 --> 3660.2599999999998
nobody will ever get there of course but

3657.59 --> 3663.6400000000003
it's not about that it's about testing

3660.26 --> 3668.3
what is real what really happened and

3663.64 --> 3672.43
defusing the illusions inserted by

3668.3 --> 3672.4300000000003
people that shaped it

3695.9 --> 3701.569
oh by the way thank you mind of God for

3698.119 --> 3712.6400000000003
the 199 dollar super chair donation when

3701.569 --> 3715.88
say me what do you mean what I have no

3712.64 --> 3719.109
idea what you're saying but thank you

3715.88 --> 3719.109
for the super chat donation

3731.66 --> 3741.0299999999997
hmm like Abba in ways right but you

3737.19 --> 3744.87
gotta realize again information if it is

3741.03 --> 3747.96
just to just imagine if like the only

3744.87 --> 3751.5
history would just be freakin statistics

3747.96 --> 3755.01
just a pile of Statistics rod-like

3751.5 --> 3761.97
reports the who the hell wants to read

3755.01 --> 3764.25
that no you need ya proper glue for the

3761.97 --> 3767.8799999999997
information to stick and that's a story

3764.25 --> 3769.85
and hey if it's about something that

3767.88 --> 3773.04
could involve some kind of pride a

3769.85 --> 3775.11
certain group then yeah to nudge it

3773.04 --> 3779.91
slightly in that direction to get that

3775.11 --> 3783.9500000000003
little bit of extra gold line paints to

3779.91 --> 3786.66
make people feel slightly better or like

3783.95 --> 3789.81
inspired by it I don't know I don't

3786.66 --> 3792.8999999999996
object too much to it as long as it's

3789.81 --> 3793.68
just nobody been like extremely wrong

3792.9 --> 3797.63
door

3793.68 --> 3802.3399999999997
like genocides covered up in that [ __ ]

3797.63 --> 3802.34
because that also happens in for Judy

3807.42 --> 3812.5190000000002
Oh giddy and sick thank you for the

3810.21 --> 3819.809
two-part super detonation buy some fruit

3812.519 --> 3823.0989999999997
X what's fruit X but yeah some berries

3819.809 --> 3823.099
would be nice I guess

3832.88 --> 3835.51
but

3843.34 --> 3846.54
all righty then

3871.54 --> 3877.81
what are you talking about eyes wide

3873.64 --> 3881.0499999999997
shut it's got a pointy end when it

3877.81 --> 3883.65
should be a dome what don't know what

3881.05 --> 3883.65
you're talking about

3909.68 --> 3912.73
oh okay

3921.02 --> 3926.71
Oh God of course shoot it now

3960.58 --> 3964.77
okay George Sanford never heard of that

3974.54 --> 3981.67
oh wow okay this is getting kind of

3978.56 --> 3981.67
weird now

4002.67 --> 4010.11
all right Guns of Navarone I repeat he

4006.07 --> 4012.7000000000003
said so what's your source for that I

4010.11 --> 4015.6400000000003
don't know anything about Warner from

4012.7 --> 4018.97
Browns actual Rockets experimentation I

4015.64 --> 4022.42
just know that he was there it is part

4018.97 --> 4027.5699999999997
of NASA I don't know much more else than

4022.42 --> 4027.57
that much more

4048.63 --> 4054.5
gossip around the water cooler of course

4051.5 --> 4054.5
yeah

4084.98 --> 4095.63
do you like the character of Christ what

4088.54 --> 4101.15
a character

4095.63 --> 4108.62
no no ways words the lessons you don't

4101.15 --> 4115.239
have to literally you know you don't

4108.62 --> 4115.239
have to like reenact everything he did

4123.399 --> 4126.469
[Music]

4142.58 --> 4151.25
okay a gem and I don't go caps on me by

4146.359 --> 4151.72
the way God in all caps is not what you

4151.25 --> 4154.72
think

4151.72 --> 4154.72
probably

4185.619 --> 4192.969
all right my gym but yeah I think yeah

4197.92 --> 4208.369
if you ride God with all caps that's not

4202.449 --> 4213.469
that it's not the Creator okay it's

4208.369 --> 4218.299999999999
something else I know you like to put

4213.469 --> 4222.01
caps there and it's not doing the thing

4218.3 --> 4222.01
that you think you're doing

4239.679 --> 4252.41
why don't you just use shift you know a

4247.54 --> 4256.07
capital letter you got to stop this caps

4252.41 --> 4259.5199999999995
addiction it's really it's getting in

4256.07 --> 4259.759999999999
your way you know that you like it so

4259.52 --> 4263.59
much

4259.76 --> 4267.76
it's literally getting in your way I

4263.59 --> 4267.76
hope you realize that a gym

4287.179 --> 4297.2300000000005
while mystical that's that's up to you

4293.32 --> 4301.34
I'm pretty sure that only one mind could

4297.23 --> 4304.909
design it all the way it is you know not

4301.34 --> 4308.929
talking about who did whatever shaping

4304.909 --> 4313.129999999999
in the realm that's another matter the

4308.929 --> 4316.6900000000005
creator you know it's like a design

4313.13 --> 4316.6900000000005
cannot be divided like that

4335.93 --> 4342.12
yeah a gem why did Microsoft put that

4339.3 --> 4344.39
button there well you know who owns

4342.12 --> 4349.62
Microsoft right

4344.39 --> 4350.1900000000005
Bill Gates so why didn't you think of it

4349.62 --> 4355.7
like that

4350.19 --> 4360.139999999999
every time you use caps lock Bill Gates

4355.7 --> 4360.139999999999
almost smiles how about that

4399.329 --> 4406.889
my god okay well I wouldn't want to make

4402.629 --> 4414.389
that level of comparison but you know

4406.889 --> 4423.979
Bill Gates is something else why is

4414.389 --> 4428.309
there caps lock on typewriters then I

4423.979 --> 4431.039000000001
don't know because back in the day it

4428.309 --> 4433.7390000000005
letters were the only way to categorize

4431.039 --> 4439.759999999999
things anyway so yeah using all caps

4433.739 --> 4443.249
could be an D - I don't know emphasized

4439.76 --> 4448.530000000001
chapters or whatever I don't know it's

4443.249 --> 4457.019
just but in this age you don't really

4448.53 --> 4461.3
need to do that you know you're not

4457.019 --> 4464.309
you're not writing down a filing system

4461.3 --> 4466.769
you're not writing a judicial letter

4464.309 --> 4469.559
where the caps might be needed here and

4466.769 --> 4471.829000000001
there in certain occasions right no

4469.559 --> 4475.649
you're chatting you're communicating

4471.829 --> 4478.099
through words that you type there's no

4475.649 --> 4485.639
good reason for you to do that unless

4478.099 --> 4491.939
you are using it to squirt and almost

4485.639 --> 4498.599
big Bill Gates smile hotseat it almost

4491.939 --> 4505.519
made him smile again now I do it

4498.599 --> 4509.929
sometimes too you know but I try to

4505.519 --> 4509.929
minimize it as much as possible

4527.8 --> 4531.35
yeah

4529.25 --> 4534.5
and when I do it I never use caps-lock

4531.35 --> 4539.2300000000005
by the way I just use shift no that

4534.5 --> 4539.23
makes every capital letter actually come

4542.08 --> 4549.91
yeah well AGM are you writing down a

4545.18 --> 4555.5
birth certificate here no you're not oh

4549.91 --> 4557.63
yeah then it's really nice to think back

4555.5 --> 4561.41
of all the times that capital letters

4557.63 --> 4564.08
are used and I don't know to justify

4561.41 --> 4570.43
your addiction I don't know what you're

4564.08 --> 4570.43
doing but just let it go man

4578.179 --> 4584.5
hey I'm perfectly calm married you I'm

4582.199 --> 4584.5
just

4627.32 --> 4638.599
you know really hm

4633.849 --> 4640.88
so you think it's funny that people get

4638.599 --> 4648.5
annoyed by that and then you experiment

4640.88 --> 4651.1900000000005
with them Wow I hope you're not actually

4648.5 --> 4651.19
proud of that

4660.37 --> 4663.47
[Music]

4667.449 --> 4672.869
what are you talking about no it's just

4669.369 --> 4677.459
pigeons there's lots of pigeons

4672.869 --> 4677.459
especially white doves over here and

4677.699 --> 4685.799999999999
plenty of birds but yet the wind is also

4682.659 --> 4685.799999999999
still going so

4688.22 --> 4691.27
[Music]

4699.859 --> 4702.579000000001
No

4709.409 --> 4713.539
it's it's a social call

4722.78 --> 4727.24
now that definitely sounds like

4724.58 --> 4727.24
something else

4748.23 --> 4754.94
I never said you said it was funny I

4751.64 --> 4759.110000000001
just said I hope you're not proud of it

4754.94 --> 4762.2699999999995
because I don't know if you think it's

4759.11 --> 4764.969999999999
whatever worth testing that all the time

4762.27 --> 4766.59
instead of just realizing like yeah it's

4764.97 --> 4770.76
an aspect that people find really

4766.59 --> 4775.22
annoying maybe I should just get rid of

4770.76 --> 4775.22
that you know

4798.26 --> 4803.08
okay

4800.5 --> 4805.54
well if you want to be preoccupied with

4803.08 --> 4807.55
testing caps allergies out there in

4805.54 --> 4810.1
social media and then by all means I

4807.55 --> 4812.71
like to test the waters in a completely

4810.1 --> 4816.25
different manner not just try to get on

4812.71 --> 4819.97
peoples nerves I'd rather see how far

4816.25 --> 4821.74
their intellect can reach see how much

4819.97 --> 4824.41
they can reflect upon what I say that's

4821.74 --> 4826.98
my testing of the waters but hey if you

4824.41 --> 4830.73
want to test people's caps allergies

4826.98 --> 4830.73
it's your life man

4852.81 --> 4868.9400000000005
what are you talking about - god you're

4857.64 --> 4868.9400000000005
squirting again no it's not

4880.62 --> 4887.88
why are some Christian so gung-ho about

4883.14 --> 4890.490000000001
the end times well because they yeah

4887.88 --> 4894.57
what they have recognized as being good

4890.49 --> 4896.82
and righteous and providing a much

4894.57 --> 4900.21
deeper understanding of the reality at

4896.82 --> 4903.719999999999
creation least to some degree and that

4900.21 --> 4907.38
same source being attacked by obviously

4903.72 --> 4910.02
evil groups out there to no end and like

4907.38 --> 4910.53
being shamed and pushed away like to no

4910.02 --> 4912.96
end

4910.53 --> 4915.54
yeah that's gonna make people really

4912.96 --> 4921.2300000000005
stressed out and just hope like when is

4915.54 --> 4921.23
this finally gonna end so I get that

4925.07 --> 4934.62
it's because they're hurt about what

4928.59 --> 4938.82
they love getting attacked but in my

4934.62 --> 4946.5
opinion it's a mistake because I think

4938.82 --> 4949.5
that the hurt is simulated you know it

4946.5 --> 4952.65
almost should be like this you know

4949.5 --> 4957.27
remember Christianity even in the Bible

4952.65 --> 4960.5
there yeah it was not respected it was

4957.27 --> 4960.5
it was attacked

4968.739 --> 4974.468999999999
and did these people that are described

4972.07 --> 4979.558999999999
in the Bible during that period pray

4974.469 --> 4988.719
everyday for the end no they didn't know

4979.559 --> 5000.719
they they took the challenge right yes

4988.719 --> 5003.15
Jones I think you're right yeah but it

5000.719 --> 5006.469
is very depressing when you crave for

5003.15 --> 5013.17
world we're just good is common sense

5006.469 --> 5015.749
and yet it seems to still visibly at

5013.17 --> 5018.719
least are audibly the senses tell you

5015.749 --> 5021.329
it's sliding the other way now that may

5018.719 --> 5022.949
that those senses may be artificially

5021.329 --> 5025.71
influenced through propaganda and

5022.949 --> 5033.268999999999
nonsense to make you feel that and I

5025.71 --> 5036.21
think that that is really the mistake is

5033.269 --> 5041.1900000000005
going with the down story with the doom

5036.21 --> 5044.329
and then tumbling down the hill no you

5041.19 --> 5048.299999999999
don't need to tumble down that hill

5044.329 --> 5051.058999999999
better to preoccupy yourself with what

5048.3 --> 5055.519
is actually real in the moment and don't

5051.059 --> 5055.519
let yourself do well upon other people's

5055.76 --> 5060.2300000000005
yeah scary stories

5067.849 --> 5072.7300000000005
that's not entirely true though George

5070.19 --> 5072.73
Sanford

5078.28 --> 5084.91
in my experience seeing more was also

5082.6 --> 5087.46
much more depressing it's a part of it

5084.91 --> 5091.69
so yeah that's not entirely true they're

5087.46 --> 5093.7300000000005
like on the long run it's gonna be

5091.69 --> 5098.25
better but yeah

5093.73 --> 5101.86
having lies dispelled in front of you

5098.25 --> 5103.18
seeing the world change and being forced

5101.86 --> 5113.469999999999
to change with it yet it can be

5103.18 --> 5117.6
depressing but yeah that that's just the

5113.47 --> 5120.51
natural consequences of seeing more

5117.6 --> 5125.1
realizing what things really are having

5120.51 --> 5130.02
cover stories dispelled an ugliness or

5125.1 --> 5130.02
mundaneness revealed behind it

5140.92 --> 5146.81
but yeah at the same time not from what

5145.01 --> 5148.88
you're looking and seeing out there and

5146.81 --> 5152.660000000001
having dispelled in front of you out

5148.88 --> 5163.58
there revealing and going there

5152.66 --> 5168.98
awakening also provides provides great

5163.58 --> 5176.03
opportunities and yeah an opportunity an

5168.98 --> 5179.9
opportunity to rebuild yourself avoiding

5176.03 --> 5183.34
more lies and more traps in your

5179.9 --> 5183.339999999999
development of what you're going to do

5188.44 --> 5194.989
but yeah it will vary most of those

5191.75 --> 5196.84
things usually start out with some form

5194.989 --> 5199.419999999999
of depression

5196.84 --> 5201.77
unless yeah there's just not a lot of

5199.42 --> 5204.01
illusions that have really caught your

5201.77 --> 5204.01
heart

5228.269 --> 5239.159000000001
right yeah it's it's also about that

5232.92 --> 5242.099
after you've just gone through it you

5239.159 --> 5243.929
also I guess especially that first start

5242.099 --> 5246.179
to realize that there's no longer this

5243.929 --> 5248.579
mysterious dread that you just can't

5246.179 --> 5250.32
grasp anymore that's also gone

5248.579 --> 5252.299999999999
you just know much more of what is

5250.32 --> 5256.558999999999
really out there what the real threats

5252.3 --> 5259.7300000000005
are there's no more miss mysterious the

5256.559 --> 5263.579000000001
mist the mystery of of some virtual doom

5259.73 --> 5266.789
will also fall away in your just in your

5263.579 --> 5271.949
just regular consciousness and I thought

5266.789 --> 5274.619
that was a great relief there's no more

5271.949 --> 5277.289
threat of some stupid supposed meteor

5274.619 --> 5281.268999999999
striking the earth every week or

5277.289 --> 5281.268999999999
something for starters

5295.44 --> 5301.53
yep and gives you more room not to get

5299.1 --> 5303.93
distracted by illusions out there and

5301.53 --> 5306.03
illusion stories and illusion excuses

5303.93 --> 5310.5
when you're confronted with like

5306.03 --> 5313.5199999999995
personal issues so you can resolve those

5310.5 --> 5317.66
personal issues better more effective

5313.52 --> 5317.660000000001
more and more confident too

5332.039 --> 5340.289
anyway I think I'm gonna round out to

5334.019 --> 5342.75
