[Music]

what in here and the sun is still

139.28 --> 142.76
hitting the wall

151.2 --> 154.72
huh

152.0 --> 156.8
it's a good thing that

154.72 --> 160.0
the noise cancellation doesn't trigger

156.8 --> 160.0
over the sound of this thing

166.55 --> 172.4
[Music]

168.84 --> 174.959
anyhow it's a bit of a little fluffy

172.4 --> 177.68
clouds it does seem a bit moist up there

174.959 --> 180.68
there is trails being left

177.68 --> 180.68
also

185.2 --> 190.07999999999998

188.03 --> 193.12
[Music]

190.08 --> 193.12

pgcnet good to see you all

206.159 --> 210.84
it is

207.36 --> 214.59900000000002
thursday the 20th oh sorry the 30th of

210.84 --> 214.599
june 2022

220.38 --> 227.4
[Music]

224.4 --> 227.4
temperature

227.68 --> 230.4
24.

231.44 --> 234.07999999999998
that's weird

238.48 --> 243.599
it feels warmer than yesterday but it

240.72 --> 245.84
it's not apparently

243.599 --> 245.84
uh

246.4 --> 251.36
rain in france hmm

249.599 --> 255.04
well the way it's looking it might just

251.36 --> 257.28000000000003
be raining this evening

255.04 --> 259.84
or otherwise tomorrow it's like they're

257.28 --> 261.59999999999997
gonna go trailing again that usually

259.84 --> 264.88
ends up with rain

261.6 --> 264.88
when it's this kind of weather

266.72 --> 274.8
yesterday was all clear it was just no

270.32 --> 274.8
no trailing so the sky was much bluer

276.72 --> 283.40000000000003
maybe that's it maybe that is just the

279.28 --> 283.4
thing that kind of makes it feel

283.84 --> 287.35999999999996
warmer

285.04 --> 290.88
even though it's the same temperature

287.36 --> 290.88
as the trailing they do i don't know

293.44 --> 297.84
hey george sanford farmers are sure

295.759 --> 300.47900000000004
protesting there in the netherlands yeah

297.84 --> 300.479
yeah they are

300.8 --> 304.8
and

301.919 --> 308.68
thank goodness they are getting a lot of

304.8 --> 308.68
support from the people

312.32 --> 318.0
but uh yeah it's not

314.88 --> 318.0
it keeps on going

320.16 --> 325.52000000000004
and like the the main parties which are

323.36 --> 328.56
the problem

325.52 --> 332.039
the vvd

328.56 --> 332.039
and d66

332.8 --> 340.88
with they are like at the core of the

335.52 --> 343.12
pvd mostly but d6 is like very

340.88 --> 345.919
world economic forum oriented and all

343.12 --> 348.08
that it's terrible and they are the ones

345.919 --> 349.919
that are nagging about farmers and all

348.08 --> 353.12
that

349.919 --> 355.919
and these crazy new illogical plants for

353.12 --> 357.68
the for our country

355.919 --> 360.0
with zoning and all that

357.68 --> 360.0
and

360.319 --> 364.24
they're just exposing themselves

362.56 --> 366.479
they're not making themselves popular

364.24 --> 368.639
and i think personally that

366.479 --> 372.08
the way it's looking

368.639 --> 372.08
they're probably gonna like

373.919 --> 378.35999999999996
go to an unexpected exit

384.319 --> 388.0
because it's just not working

388.72 --> 394.28000000000003
it's not working what they're doing

390.24 --> 394.28000000000003
people aren't buying it

400.16 --> 406.47900000000004
and hey our farmers are kind of badass

404.08 --> 408.8
they really are

406.479 --> 412.0
so

408.8 --> 412.0
it's just not gonna work

419.28 --> 424.88
right i mean they're not as like super

422.08 --> 427.44
brutal as like farmers in france because

424.88 --> 430.8
yeah we we have seen those protests

427.44 --> 430.8
right they just like

431.599 --> 436.08
they yeah they go [ __ ] spraying right

434.16 --> 438.639
away and all that right they just go

436.08 --> 440.8
straight to hell this is just full-on

438.639 --> 443.68
farmer warfare just

440.8 --> 447.039
use their manure as a weapon

443.68 --> 449.28000000000003
the netherlands is like sort of now

447.039 --> 451.84
halfway there i've seen like a farmer

449.28 --> 451.84
just dump

451.919 --> 456.08
dirt and stuff right in front of like

456.88 --> 460.15999999999997
in front of a government building and

458.4 --> 462.23999999999995
all that

460.16 --> 464.08000000000004
to that level

462.24 --> 466.0
but not much further it's not full

464.08 --> 468.87899999999996
french style yet and maybe it doesn't

466.0 --> 471.28
have to be like that

468.879 --> 474.639
but i bet that they could go that far if

471.28 --> 479.19899999999996
these crazy world economic forum

474.639 --> 481.199
treacherous political parties continue

479.199 --> 482.8
this insanity then they might just as

481.199 --> 485.12
well go at that far

482.8 --> 486.39
anyway

485.12 --> 487.84000000000003
gusto

486.39 --> 489.52
[Music]

487.84 --> 492.75899999999996
still enjoying that especially with this

489.52 --> 492.75899999999996
kind of heat

496.319 --> 499.8
hey jeff gassett

516.479 --> 520.64
right yeah pjc that it's good to see the

518.64 --> 522.88
farmers stand up but it's also good to

520.64 --> 522.88
see

523.039 --> 527.92
the rest of the country through social

525.44 --> 527.9200000000001
media

528.08 --> 534.8000000000001
also also basically

530.88 --> 537.2
become much more aware of this

534.8 --> 540.0799999999999
like if you compare the situation now

537.2 --> 543.44
with say 10 years ago

540.08 --> 546.64
this is a giant improvement it really is

543.44 --> 546.6400000000001
because 10 years ago

546.839 --> 553.6
well things like this also happen

551.04 --> 555.92
but then the fast majority was just like

553.6 --> 557.44
too distracted and too like oh we gotta

555.92 --> 559.68
trust the plan

557.44 --> 561.2790000000001
of the government not really

559.68 --> 563.68
understanding what it is they were even

561.279 --> 566.48
doing

563.68 --> 568.64
and now people are just like yeah we get

566.48 --> 570.9590000000001
it now we're not gonna fall for this

568.64 --> 570.959
again

571.44 --> 577.2790000000001
and they're on to it

573.92 --> 579.519
and that is very hopeful

577.279 --> 581.2
it's a great relief because 10 years ago

579.519 --> 582.64
that was a nightmare

581.2 --> 586.72
for me

582.64 --> 586.72
like when obama and all that came in

587.44 --> 594.1600000000001
like everybody was just going nuts

591.36 --> 596.08
and even the people that knew

594.16 --> 598.0
like oh this is bad news they still

596.08 --> 599.36
would keep it silent because there was

598.0 --> 602.16
just this

599.36 --> 604.8000000000001
atmosphere of hysteria going around if

602.16 --> 608.399
you went against it

604.8 --> 610.88
well that spell effect has worn off

608.399 --> 612.88
it's about time

610.88 --> 615.92
so i have good hopes for my country

612.88 --> 619.04
despite just the ah

615.92 --> 622.04
aggravating nature of just some of these

619.04 --> 622.04
politicians

632.88 --> 637.8389999999999
but the spgc net it is basically the

635.12 --> 641.68
same gen agenda around

637.839 --> 641.6800000000001
most the western world and the rest

642.399 --> 645.88
most of the world

660.079 --> 662.56
anyhow

666.64 --> 670.64
yesterday's flat earth debate was great

672.56 --> 675.8389999999999
it's a pretty good show

677.6 --> 684.24
and so was my early bird show i thought

681.6 --> 686.24
i did have a couple of like rage moments

684.24 --> 690.64
towards the trolls but other than that i

686.24 --> 693.04
was very focused and it was like

690.64 --> 695.8389999999999
well a themed show

693.04 --> 695.8389999999999
i succeeded

696.0 --> 702.079
it's not that easy for me to do that

698.16 --> 704.16
when you do an everyday show

702.079 --> 707.3599999999999
uh

704.16 --> 707.36
let's see what else

714.72 --> 717.72
uh

720.81 --> 725.1999999999999
[Music]

723.279 --> 727.68
yeah pjc net yeah they're pushing the

725.2 --> 729.76
agenda aggressively but that's not the

727.68 --> 732.3199999999999
way to do it though

729.76 --> 733.76
the the agenda pushing before all of

732.32 --> 736.48
this time

733.76 --> 738.56
worked relatively well because

736.48 --> 741.04
it wasn't aggressive they were actually

738.56 --> 743.279
just trying to seduce you

741.04 --> 744.48
to go along with it

743.279 --> 746.8
because

744.48 --> 747.6
they could still keep the imagination in

746.8 --> 749.5999999999999
you

747.6 --> 750.5600000000001
that it was for a good cause or

749.6 --> 751.519
something

750.56 --> 753.5999999999999
right

751.519 --> 756.079
well now

753.6 --> 756.0790000000001
because

757.44 --> 760.8800000000001
like that point has been reached where

759.12 --> 762.88
it's just like

760.88 --> 765.4399999999999
it's not working anymore people really

762.88 --> 767.519
know now like no this is

765.44 --> 770.9590000000001
not good like it's actually eugenics

767.519 --> 773.12
driven and overpopulation but then

770.959 --> 775.1999999999999
the research concerning that and just

773.12 --> 778.24
logical consistent

775.2 --> 782.0
trains of thinking show that it is

778.24 --> 783.6800000000001
not effective for the presumed causes

782.0 --> 786.8
right if you're going to do this it's

783.68 --> 789.279
going to make everything worse

786.8 --> 789.279
like there's

790.32 --> 794.88
nothing is more polluting

793.12 --> 795.68
than war

794.88 --> 798.8
and

795.68 --> 798.8
social unrest

798.839 --> 804.5600000000001
right and if you just destroy something

802.079 --> 807.279
like what is it what is going to be left

804.56 --> 809.76
to uphold power right it's nothing so

807.279 --> 812.88
it's just going to be chaos then and no

809.76 --> 814.48
control over environment and anything

812.88 --> 815.92
right because if it all crumbles well

814.48 --> 817.6
people that are left that are going to

815.92 --> 820.079
be ambitious are just going to do

817.6 --> 822.0790000000001
whatever the [ __ ] they want then

820.079 --> 824.079
so it's all nonsensical people

822.079 --> 825.3599999999999
understand that they're not falling for

824.079 --> 827.199
it anymore not even from an

825.36 --> 830.16
environmental perspective

827.199 --> 833.68
and because they're now so aggressive

830.16 --> 835.04
like trying to bully you into it

833.68 --> 836.399
that just

835.04 --> 838.959
that just

836.399 --> 842.88
cements

838.959 --> 845.5189999999999
our position against it even more

842.88 --> 847.72
that like it's just doubling down like

845.519 --> 851.68
anti-flat earth is that's just making us

847.72 --> 853.9200000000001
flatter to think like yeah no

851.68 --> 856.8
you definitely don't have a counter

853.92 --> 858.7199999999999
argument i was definitely right

856.8 --> 860.88
that effect

858.72 --> 863.279
is what's going on

860.88 --> 865.36
so they're aggressive pushing it is the

863.279 --> 866.65
parallels between flat earth versus

865.36 --> 867.6800000000001
anti-flat earthers

866.65 --> 870.56
[Music]

867.68 --> 873.279
and the political situation

870.56 --> 874.399
how that works with politics is very

873.279 --> 876.959
close

874.399 --> 879.839
and i've seen that for a long time

876.959 --> 882.3199999999999
called it out for a couple of years now

879.839 --> 885.839
like look

882.32 --> 889.519
the patterns are almost identical

885.839 --> 890.9590000000001
and they will continue to be so

889.519 --> 894.079
what we're going to learn from the

890.959 --> 896.959
developments within the flat earth scene

894.079 --> 899.04
going up against the flat earthers

896.959 --> 901.3599999999999
it's like a head

899.04 --> 902.399
it's a head of politics

901.36 --> 904.0
so

902.399 --> 907.279
crazy things that you're going to see

904.0 --> 909.04
develop among anti-flat earther

907.279 --> 911.199
people that are going to be all double

909.04 --> 913.199
speaking wizardy

911.199 --> 915.519
whatever is going to be halfway working

913.199 --> 917.4399999999999
about that you're going to see in the

915.519 --> 919.36
future

917.44 --> 921.36
among politicians among these

919.36 --> 924.88
politicians that are desperate and in a

921.36 --> 926.9590000000001
corner so it synchronizes with them it

924.88 --> 929.519
resonates on the same level anti-flat

926.959 --> 931.279
earthers are cut off they have no way to

929.519 --> 933.04
win but they will never give up and i

931.279 --> 934.399
think they can just intimidate and bully

933.04 --> 936.079
their way through

934.399 --> 938.399
effectively

936.079 --> 940.8
shush everybody to sleep and that's

938.399 --> 943.44
exactly

940.8 --> 945.8389999999999
what this political movement these

943.44 --> 948.8800000000001
eugenicists

945.839 --> 950.9590000000001
world economic forum sociopaths that's

948.88 --> 953.6
what they want to

950.959 --> 956.4799999999999
so it's only logical

953.6 --> 958.5600000000001
that they would start to copy these

956.48 --> 960.9590000000001
types of behaviors even if they've never

958.56 --> 963.199
even seen a flat earth versus anti-flat

960.959 --> 966.2399999999999
earth debate

963.199 --> 970.16
because it is the same effect it is the

966.24 --> 972.5600000000001
same position the same longing the same

970.16 --> 974.8
stubbornness

972.56 --> 977.04
relentlessness

974.8 --> 978.639
so it's going to end up following the

977.04 --> 981.279
same patterns

978.639 --> 984.48
called it years ago and it is just

981.279 --> 987.36
becoming more and more blatant

984.48 --> 987.36
how i called it

994.839 --> 998.32
what

996.56 --> 1002.3599999999999
okay jeff

998.32 --> 1002.36
i don't know what you're talking about

1011.44 --> 1014.619
[Music]

1024.559 --> 1027.36
i don't know man

1032.16 --> 1038.76
i don't know if they're gonna do that

1034.16 --> 1038.76
i mean it's socialism here

1039.039 --> 1043.679
so they might do that or they might not

1040.799 --> 1045.52
do that it all depends

1043.679 --> 1049.44
it depends on how

1045.52 --> 1051.679
much they really want to keep us

1049.44 --> 1053.44
content

1051.679 --> 1055.44
right because it's their problem they

1053.44 --> 1058.0
know it's their problem they're just

1055.44 --> 1060.48
hoping that we'll be patient enough

1058.0 --> 1062.559
to see through to the end when it all

1060.48 --> 1064.559
crumbles so far that when they then

1062.559 --> 1066.72
basically pull out the rock from

1064.559 --> 1068.799
underneath us all

1066.72 --> 1071.6000000000001
that we're not gonna do anything about

1068.799 --> 1071.6
them anymore

1073.6 --> 1079.039
that's the long-term strategy that is

1075.76 --> 1081.919
the universal risk of socialism

1079.039 --> 1084.32
when it goes bad

1081.919 --> 1085.2
so i

1084.32 --> 1087.52
like

1085.2 --> 1089.679
there's no point in me

1087.52 --> 1092.6399999999999
to address it

1089.679 --> 1097.2
if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen

1092.64 --> 1097.2
ah thank you elise g for the modding

1098.72 --> 1101.3600000000001
that was quick

1103.679 --> 1109.3200000000002
so zap tappy i don't know why you asked

1106.08 --> 1109.32
that question

1117.76 --> 1124.08
was there any reason you asked it oh and

1120.48 --> 1124.08
by the way i brought up

1124.4 --> 1129.039
the gyro compass situation with the flat

1127.12 --> 1129.36
earth debate yesterday in the after show

1129.039 --> 1130.799
though

1129.36 --> 1132.8799999999999
[Music]

1130.799 --> 1135.84
i think it wasn't the after show

1132.88 --> 1140.16
was it i don't know i remember but

1135.84 --> 1143.84
yeah that whole thing is a giant fraud

1140.16 --> 1143.8400000000001
as i suspected in the moment

1146.32 --> 1151.6789999999999
maybe you knew more than me

1148.72 --> 1152.96
what are you like hoping for another

1151.679 --> 1154.72
paycheck

1152.96 --> 1156.64
like free money from the government why

1154.72 --> 1159.44
why would you want

1156.64 --> 1159.44
that's not good

1160.48 --> 1164.96
like with me it's like this okay if

1163.12 --> 1167.52
they're gonna like hand that out i'll be

1164.96 --> 1170.72
like oh okay that's handy

1167.52 --> 1175.2
but i'm definitely not gonna like long

1170.72 --> 1179.84
for that like oh government oh please

1175.2 --> 1179.8400000000001
oh we needed some no no no

1180.559 --> 1184.559
right and if they're gonna send out

1182.16 --> 1186.88
checks then it's like oh okay

1184.559 --> 1186.8799999999999
fine

1189.84 --> 1195.12
i don't know more than you except happy

1199.919 --> 1203.919
energy bill coming i hope for

1202.4 --> 1206.799
okay

1203.919 --> 1208.88
that's logical i guess

1206.799 --> 1211.36
well me i

1208.88 --> 1213.5200000000002
am not having to worry about that

1211.36 --> 1215.84
directly because i literally don't have

1213.52 --> 1219.12
to pay for my electricity

1215.84 --> 1221.1999999999998
that's on my landlord's account

1219.12 --> 1223.36
and we've already been kind of like

1221.2 --> 1224.88
paying him

1223.36 --> 1228.4799999999998
decently

1224.88 --> 1231.2800000000002
so it's really his problem

1228.48 --> 1232.88
and he's heightened the rent slightly

1231.28 --> 1236.08
so on the long run that is kind of

1232.88 --> 1237.8400000000001
annoying but not like super problematic

1236.08 --> 1241.76
for me

1237.84 --> 1244.24
and i yeah i don't have like a motorized

1241.76 --> 1247.039
vehicle of any sort so i'm not noticing

1244.24 --> 1248.799
any gas prices or anything

1247.039 --> 1250.72
personally

1248.799 --> 1251.679
i'm kind of in a lucky position like

1250.72 --> 1253.1200000000001
that

1251.679 --> 1255.2
lucky

1253.12 --> 1258.1999999999998
it's not really lucky

1255.2 --> 1258.2
but

1268.32 --> 1273.28
okay dj

1270.72 --> 1277.159
oh that's very funny

1273.28 --> 1277.1589999999999
very very funny

1280.799 --> 1284.48
didn't catch that one leg

1287.679 --> 1293.799
now i didn't catch it first as well but

1289.679 --> 1293.799
it's it's all garbage

1312.96 --> 1318.799
yeah pgc net now it's but that's it's

1315.6 --> 1321.4399999999998
gonna be a problem

1318.799 --> 1323.52
right because what you're saying yeah it

1321.44 --> 1325.76
might just as well be happening it might

1323.52 --> 1328.24
all just be a rig

1325.76 --> 1329.44
it might all be a scheme the entire

1328.24 --> 1333.159
thing

1329.44 --> 1333.159
that they're just artificially

1333.36 --> 1337.6
cutting off the sources making the

1335.039 --> 1340.32
prices higher but that yeah the company

1337.6 --> 1342.08
executives might literally be getting

1340.32 --> 1344.3999999999999
all record profits out of it so it's

1342.08 --> 1347.28
going to be that story again right

1344.4 --> 1349.2800000000002
everybody's doing worse oh except

1347.28 --> 1350.48
a few companies

1349.28 --> 1352.96
that are like

1350.48 --> 1355.44
tripling their profits

1352.96 --> 1356.24
all of a sudden

1355.44 --> 1357.919
right

1356.24 --> 1360.08
and that's the question oh is is

1357.919 --> 1361.6000000000001
everybody gonna let them get away with

1360.08 --> 1363.52
it huh

1361.6 --> 1366.52
you're gonna let them just get away with

1363.52 --> 1366.52
that

1375.12 --> 1377.4399999999998
right

1381.039 --> 1385.039
i genuinely

1382.96 --> 1387.3600000000001
genuinely think

1385.039 --> 1390.4
that it's time

1387.36 --> 1391.6
or the old left

1390.4 --> 1395.2800000000002
to stop

1391.6 --> 1397.9189999999999
whining about government

1395.28 --> 1401.039
and actually start focusing on like

1397.919 --> 1403.8400000000001
robber baron mega corporations

1401.039 --> 1403.84
that's what i think

1405.919 --> 1408.48
yeah

1406.799 --> 1412.08
because

1408.48 --> 1414.64
they weren't there to that extent

1412.08 --> 1417.36
like 50 years ago

1414.64 --> 1418.7990000000002
they are now

1417.36 --> 1421.279
so first

1418.799 --> 1423.2
the left was like oh we gotta rise up

1421.279 --> 1424.4
against like bad governments that are

1423.2 --> 1429.1200000000001
like

1424.4 --> 1431.52
fascists or racist or whatever man

1429.12 --> 1434.1589999999999
but now like

1431.52 --> 1436.24
they've moved right into the hands of

1434.159 --> 1439.2
robber baron mega corporation that are

1436.24 --> 1441.2
gladly abusing their entire stance

1439.2 --> 1443.279
to just assault

1441.2 --> 1445.76
the public

1443.279 --> 1447.36
and then basically shake some more money

1445.76 --> 1450.559
out of them

1447.36 --> 1453.6789999999999
so when is and a new left

1450.559 --> 1456.8799999999999
going to stand up and actually

1453.679 --> 1460.24
declare war on the mega corporations and

1456.88 --> 1461.919
just like really do that

1460.24 --> 1464.96
or he's gonna say like i'm gonna

1461.919 --> 1468.0
completely boycott this which means

1464.96 --> 1470.0
little availability

1468.0 --> 1472.559
but make work

1470.0 --> 1474.64
to just replace everything

1472.559 --> 1476.96
that these mega corporation rubber

1474.64 --> 1478.96
barons are positioning themselves to

1476.96 --> 1482.24
become

1478.96 --> 1484.4
essential just replace those essential

1482.24 --> 1486.08
functions every single one of the

1484.4 --> 1490.3200000000002
essential functions that the rubber

1486.08 --> 1493.1999999999998
barons are taking in replace those right

1490.32 --> 1494.8799999999999
this is not as difficult as replacing

1493.2 --> 1498.4
power in government

1494.88 --> 1498.4
which is much more hazardous

1498.64 --> 1503.15
it's a corporation this is just

1501.919 --> 1504.5590000000002
public function

1503.15 --> 1505.679
[Music]

1504.559 --> 1508.24
right

1505.679 --> 1509.919
it's it's a function for the general

1508.24 --> 1512.08
public

1509.919 --> 1515.8400000000001
they've been maneuvering themselves in

1512.08 --> 1515.84
positions to become indispensable

1516.88 --> 1522.48
while making everything worse

1519.279 --> 1523.76
so there's only one way to counter it

1522.48 --> 1527.039
retract

1523.76 --> 1528.48
go back to basics and actually do that

1527.039 --> 1531.2
and there's a lot of people many ways

1528.48 --> 1534.559
that are doing the left used to do that

1531.2 --> 1536.96
the hippies and all that some of them

1534.559 --> 1538.8799999999999
now they're not doing that anymore they

1536.96 --> 1540.96
should be doing that again

1538.88 --> 1543.44
and actually realize those mega

1540.96 --> 1547.3600000000001
corporations they're always the problem

1543.44 --> 1547.3600000000001
like they're always the problem

1550.24 --> 1553.52
so

1551.36 --> 1557.1999999999998
make a movement

1553.52 --> 1560.32
of that specifically against mega

1557.2 --> 1563.039
corporations against globalism against

1560.32 --> 1564.3999999999999
eugenics against all of it

1563.039 --> 1567.52
an actual

1564.4 --> 1569.8400000000001
left-wing style movement

1567.52 --> 1572.08
is not

1569.84 --> 1574.6399999999999
corporate slaves

1572.08 --> 1576.08
not social justice warrior

1574.64 --> 1579.039
mercenaries

1576.08 --> 1582.08
but actual free living

1579.039 --> 1586.4
old rooted left style

1582.08 --> 1588.3999999999999
anti-mega corporation rubber barons

1586.4 --> 1590.4
i think that

1588.4 --> 1593.6000000000001
would be a great development for the

1590.4 --> 1595.039
world it would be a refreshing

1593.6 --> 1597.76
new

1595.039 --> 1600.48
left that will be more sensible

1597.76 --> 1602.48
and i think i'm not alone in in seeing

1600.48 --> 1604.32
this happening i think there's i've had

1602.48 --> 1605.44
i've seen other people already kind of

1604.32 --> 1607.52
be like

1605.44 --> 1610.48
we gotta

1607.52 --> 1611.76
gotta wake up from this slavery

1610.48 --> 1614.4
that we've

1611.76 --> 1616.4
on the left side left of thinkers have

1614.4 --> 1619.2
gotten trapped into and

1616.4 --> 1622.0
become free again

1619.2 --> 1626.8400000000001
undo the chains of the rubber barons

1622.0 --> 1626.84
that's the great challenge now

1630.72 --> 1634.72
not true left that's hilarious yeah not

1633.279 --> 1638.24
true left

1634.72 --> 1638.24
we need a new true left

1638.88 --> 1646.88
the left that cannot be incorporated

1643.84 --> 1649.6789999999999
right a left that does not [ __ ]

1646.88 --> 1649.679
to ads

1650.399 --> 1653.36
and to

1652.32 --> 1654.8799999999999
easy

1653.36 --> 1656.8799999999999
jobs

1654.88 --> 1658.88
that are like not doing any good that

1656.88 --> 1661.7600000000002
are bad for everybody

1658.88 --> 1664.48
and that are playing into crazy marxist

1661.76 --> 1667.12
indoctrination schemes which really is

1664.48 --> 1668.64
all corporatized right i mean that did

1667.12 --> 1670.8799999999999
go around

1668.64 --> 1674.5590000000002
but the corporation some corporations

1670.88 --> 1676.159
has like have like really aggressively

1674.559 --> 1678.08
been marxist

1676.159 --> 1680.72
like more than

1678.08 --> 1683.6789999999999
people would normally even naturally

1680.72 --> 1686.159
want to do because it's it's not good

1683.679 --> 1688.64
it's very dark it's not something that

1686.159 --> 1690.48
makes you happy but hey a corporate head

1688.64 --> 1691.44
just decides like oh we're going to do

1690.48 --> 1693.76
that

1691.44 --> 1696.559
this is an executive decision it's just

1693.76 --> 1698.96
programmed people do that they're just

1696.559 --> 1700.72
gonna do it then because they're doing

1698.96 --> 1704.559
it for money they've been told to do it

1700.72 --> 1706.799
right because on your own marxism is not

1704.559 --> 1709.84
the nice thing is like being a hardcore

1706.799 --> 1712.24
satanist it really sucks actually it's

1709.84 --> 1713.84
very [ __ ] miserable everything is

1712.24 --> 1715.919
about the end

1713.84 --> 1718.48
and destroying everything and giving up

1715.919 --> 1721.3600000000001
hope about everything

1718.48 --> 1721.3600000000001
it's disgusting

1722.88 --> 1725.3600000000001
so

1724.399 --> 1727.6789999999999
yeah

1725.36 --> 1729.9189999999999
mega corporations

1727.679 --> 1732.72
they're sociopathic

1729.919 --> 1736.0800000000002
rubber barons

1732.72 --> 1739.44
that are just abusing this marxist left

1736.08 --> 1741.84
mind control mechanism the real left the

1739.44 --> 1743.679
natural born left needs to break free of

1741.84 --> 1746.72
this garbage

1743.679 --> 1750.159
and get wise

1746.72 --> 1752.64
stop being enslaved

1750.159 --> 1754.7990000000002
by the rubber barons right because they

1752.64 --> 1757.919
are effective it's not even a joke

1754.799 --> 1758.84
anymore it is a joke but it isn't really

we're fighting for our freedom

the way to do it is to be slaves in a

that's the way we're going to show the

all the grabbers are just laughing their

asses off

1809.76 --> 1815.84
stop new people from getting in it

let those that are trapped in there let

1820.0 --> 1826.799
them just run themselves out

1823.2 --> 1829.1200000000001
right they're gonna get exhausted

just ensure that no new people roll in

there let it just die of its own misery

1835.039 --> 1838.08
create a protected

freedom and sensibility and that's very

1863.6 --> 1867.1999999999998
tough now sensibility right

1867.519 --> 1871.44
that's

1868.32 --> 1873.84
that's like becoming a precious resource

1871.44 --> 1876.48
because like when you're that free and

1873.84 --> 1880.0
you tolerate that many things in all

1876.48 --> 1883.519
directions then what is sensible right

1880.0 --> 1887.6
you lose your sensibility

2302.24 --> 2307.2
gravity is just a theory because

2304.079 --> 2309.92
technically it isn't a theory

2307.2 --> 2312.3999999999996
it's a concept

2309.92 --> 2313.359
like a theory would be

2312.4 --> 2316.64
well

2313.359 --> 2320.24
some form of hypothesis which would have

2316.64 --> 2321.2
a causal relation and all that

2320.24 --> 2323.7599999999998
in it

2323.76 --> 2328.19

dude

2376.64 --> 2382.0
yeah it's good to that you know to

2379.2 --> 2385.1189999999997
answer the right direction as it were

2382.0 --> 2387.44
being a flat earther no but

2385.119 --> 2390.56
if there was coriolis the earth would

2387.44 --> 2390.56
spin underneath helicopter

2391.359 --> 2395.04
that's

2392.48 --> 2395.04
correct

2395.28 --> 2401.119
but i wanted to know specifically what

2398.24 --> 2404.16
is the coriolis effect

2401.119 --> 2404.1600000000003
can you tell me that

2409.28 --> 2413.76
oh goody

2410.64 --> 2413.7599999999998
got derp gone too

europe gun 3

2439.2 --> 2443.04
yeah

2440.48 --> 2443.04
fair enough

2443.28 --> 2445.76
but this

2447.28 --> 2452.7200000000003
it's tough you know because if it's just

2449.599 --> 2455.52
really really dumb

2452.72 --> 2456.64
then that almost lowers the derpcon

2455.52 --> 2459.44
score

2456.64 --> 2461.2799999999997
because of just sheer inability right

2459.44 --> 2463.76
they're almost innocent because they're

2461.28 --> 2465.92
that stupid

2463.76 --> 2469.119
right so there is like if they're just

2465.92 --> 2471.52
really really dumb

2469.119 --> 2473.839
you can't really be like oh how dare you

2471.52 --> 2474.88
freaking bat because they're really dumb

okay

2476.64 --> 2479.2799999999997
all right

2479.599 --> 2482.8
you go believe that

2483.119 --> 2488.079
like this guy i mean

2485.28 --> 2491.28
who at this point is still gonna say

2488.079 --> 2494.5600000000004
how to prove you're a flirt

2491.28 --> 2498.0
fail some exams

2502.079 --> 2507.52
that has actually failed their exams i

2504.8 --> 2509.599
don't know any flat earther

that would dare hang around with me that

2509.599 --> 2513.44
hasn't

2511.04 --> 2515.359
just went through school right they

2513.44 --> 2517.599
succeeded it

2517.599 --> 2521.28
all [ __ ]

2518.96 --> 2523.7200000000003

2521.28 --> 2528.079
remark is just so

2523.72 --> 2532.72
incredibly [ __ ] it is unbelievable

2528.079 --> 2532.7200000000003
that's like a 60 i could a q joke

2532.88 --> 2537.28
so dumb

2534.96 --> 2540.0
i don't know any flat earthers that have

2537.28 --> 2543.7200000000003
even failed exams not a single one i

2540.0 --> 2543.72
don't know any

so yeah

2555.76 --> 2562.3190000000004
every time a troll makes a sock account

2559.52 --> 2564.24
to try and troll the opponent

2562.319 --> 2567.2799999999997
all they're doing is just trolling

2564.24 --> 2569.68
themselves three times worse

2567.28 --> 2572.4
than what they thought they were gonna

2569.68 --> 2572.3999999999996
troll on us

2575.04 --> 2580.16
i mean you're literally attacking by

2577.64 --> 2583.24
self-mutilating you uh yourself it's

2580.16 --> 2585.5989999999997
like i'm gonna shock you somehow by

2583.24 --> 2588.24
self-mutilating myself right in front of

2585.599 --> 2589.52
you hahaha you didn't expect that did

2588.24 --> 2591.359
you

2589.52 --> 2593.839
right

2591.359 --> 2593.839
okay

2605.52 --> 2610.8
hey godzilla

2607.68 --> 2612.0
yeah zeptappy says now

2610.8 --> 2614.48
that he's

2612.0 --> 2616.88
a flat earther he is kind of making the

2614.48 --> 2617.76
basic remarks but that could simply mean

2616.88 --> 2620.4
that

2617.76 --> 2623.92
he's switched template and he's now been

2620.4 --> 2625.28
assigned to act like he's a flat earther

2623.92 --> 2629.119
right

2625.28 --> 2629.119
that could very easily be the case

2632.8 --> 2638.8
so just uh

2635.599 --> 2638.8
let's keep testing him

2640.319 --> 2645.359
i don't trust yeah i never trusted

2642.72 --> 2647.359
anybody that's been a baller or

2645.359 --> 2649.04
anti-flat earther it's like once you

2647.359 --> 2650.16
become an anti-flat earther there's no

2649.04 --> 2651.839
way back

2650.16 --> 2653.839
there really isn't you become

2651.839 --> 2657.119
demonically infested

2653.839 --> 2659.7599999999998
you have attracted dark traits

2657.119 --> 2663.359
that are even on a societal level which

2659.76 --> 2666.8
is completely inacceptable

2663.359 --> 2667.5989999999997
and they're not gonna go away

2666.8 --> 2670.2400000000002
like

2667.599 --> 2673.599
to basically lose anti-flat earther

2670.24 --> 2675.2
traits you need very serious like

2673.599 --> 2677.28
therapy

2675.2 --> 2680.0789999999997
where you have your where you don't have

2677.28 --> 2681.92
social media contact

2680.079 --> 2685.52
and you're just guided by therapists in

2681.92 --> 2688.96
some therapeutical place to like really

2685.52 --> 2690.72
reflect on it and then like vow to never

2688.96 --> 2692.56
do that again

2690.72 --> 2696.319
i think that's the only way to get rid

2692.56 --> 2698.56
of being an anti-flat earther

2696.319 --> 2700.64
you have to go through some very serious

2698.56 --> 2703.359
therapy it's not a joke like that's on

2700.64 --> 2707.5989999999997
the same level as like

2703.359 --> 2710.24
serious war related ptsd therapy it's

2707.599 --> 2712.88
i'm not joking it's i know it may sound

2710.24 --> 2715.7599999999998
funny to in a way but it's actually

2712.88 --> 2715.76
really serious

2717.52 --> 2722.16
so i don't know about septepi

2720.56 --> 2724.4
he's shown

2722.16 --> 2728.16
a couple of anti-flat earther traits but

2724.4 --> 2730.1600000000003
he's never really like went all the way

2728.16 --> 2733.839
like the more

2730.16 --> 2736.8799999999997
anti-flat earth channel like people

2733.839 --> 2738.88
so it could go either way but for me the

2736.88 --> 2740.88
only way that would really do it is if

2738.88 --> 2744.96
he had the balls to get on the flat

2740.88 --> 2747.2000000000003
earth debates in discord and at least

2744.96 --> 2748.4
went on with his voice and start

2747.2 --> 2751.4399999999996
explaining

2748.4 --> 2751.44
how did this happen

2753.44 --> 2758.48
and and actually like show some serious

2756.079 --> 2759.599
psychological self-reflection on how did

2758.48 --> 2761.92
this

2759.599 --> 2763.3590000000004
happen how did you eventually turn

2761.92 --> 2766.4
around

2763.359 --> 2766.4
what did it for you

2766.48 --> 2772.16
and like how has your experience changed

2769.599 --> 2774.48
because it does

2772.16 --> 2777.92
becoming a flat earther changes like

2774.48 --> 2777.92
your entire perspective

2778.319 --> 2782.56
it it

2779.44 --> 2784.96
changes just the way your sensories work

2782.56 --> 2784.96
even

2786.16 --> 2788.64
so

2787.52 --> 2790.24
prove it

2788.64 --> 2792.56
show us that you've actually been

2790.24 --> 2794.319
through that

2792.56 --> 2796.88
if you're gonna talk about that and it's

2794.319 --> 2798.8
fake we'll know if it's real we'll feel

2796.88 --> 2802.2000000000003
it i'll feel it

2798.8 --> 2802.2000000000003
with my empathy

2802.24 --> 2807.04
so yeah september so really cute that

2804.88 --> 2808.1600000000003
you now want to be this person in the

2807.04 --> 2810.0
chat

2808.16 --> 2812.0
but if you're actually serious then

2810.0 --> 2813.599
you'll go on the flat earth debates on

2812.0 --> 2817.4
discord

2813.599 --> 2817.4
and give your testimony

2818.96 --> 2821.76
you know what to do

2825.44 --> 2828.96
yeah okay is that happy he led you in

2827.119 --> 2830.4
the club that's cute

2828.96 --> 2832.8
if you go

2830.4 --> 2836.079
on nathan's

2832.8 --> 2839.04
letter of debate in the discord

2836.079 --> 2842.079
and you give your testimony and you get

2839.04 --> 2843.7599999999998
out of it well nathan will be able to

2842.079 --> 2845.3590000000004
judge

2843.76 --> 2850.1600000000003
if you do that

2845.359 --> 2850.16
i will give you a wrench here in my chat

2853.76 --> 2857.1600000000003
that's the condition

2878.64 --> 2883.04
you don't like nathan you don't have to

2880.8 --> 2887.8390000000004
like him

2883.04 --> 2887.839
you just have to respect him his skill

2888.559 --> 2893.3590000000004
i don't always like nathan i mean

2890.64 --> 2897.52
sometimes he treats me kind of poorly

2893.359 --> 2897.52
but i'm like oh wow well whatever

2898.0 --> 2903.359
like it i basically see oh you treat me

2900.4 --> 2907.2000000000003
poorly well that's your loss then

2903.359 --> 2907.2
i'm not gonna get angry over it

2908.88 --> 2912.7200000000003
but yeah that's the condition you don't

2910.72 --> 2915.5989999999997
have to like him you just have to get on

2912.72 --> 2917.839
the discord and give some testimony

2915.599 --> 2920.2400000000002
about how you actually became a flat

2917.839 --> 2922.88
earther and we'll find out whether

2920.24 --> 2924.5589999999997
you're talking the truth or not

2922.88 --> 2928.839
that's the condition for you to get a

2924.559 --> 2928.8390000000004
wrench in my chat

2938.48 --> 2943.839
if you think nathan is faking it then

2940.64 --> 2943.839
you are a lunatic

2976.72 --> 2982.8799999999997
oh no be a youtuber before

2979.839 --> 2985.839
so what

2982.88 --> 2985.839
so what

2990.16 --> 2994.44
what the [ __ ] does that matter

3001.2 --> 3007.48
that's a false dichotomy zapdappy you're

3004.0 --> 3007.48
being a dick

3025.119 --> 3031.359
no he's just very he's very protective

3028.4 --> 3034.319
of his channel and his work and i agree

3031.359 --> 3036.319
there's been a lot of very specific

3034.319 --> 3038.24
history

3036.319 --> 3040.8
that has taken place on the flat earth

3038.24 --> 3044.16
debate i was part of it i was there

3040.8 --> 3046.0
he's very protective of it

3044.16 --> 3047.52
right he's not going to be like oh i'm

3046.0 --> 3050.16
going to look out

3047.52 --> 3052.88
i'm going to stick out like a nail

3050.16 --> 3055.1189999999997
or sore thumb and just be like oh i look

3052.88 --> 3057.28
at me look at me and then have youtube

3055.119 --> 3060.48
smash all his work yeah he's not like

3057.28 --> 3062.0
that he's very careful

3060.48 --> 3063.44
right

3062.0 --> 3066.319
i'm

3063.44 --> 3068.8
not that careful i am a bit careful i'm

3066.319 --> 3071.52
like halfway careful halfway absolutely

3068.8 --> 3073.2000000000003
relentless and

3071.52 --> 3075.839
out of control

3073.2 --> 3078.319
in between

3075.839 --> 3078.319
that's me

3078.96 --> 3083.76
in that sense i'm not even worried that

3080.8 --> 3086.079
all my work is deleted

3083.76 --> 3088.88
i mean i would not like that at all it

3086.079 --> 3091.119
is in a way my life's work

3088.88 --> 3093.28
but

3091.119 --> 3096.1600000000003
i don't need it

3093.28 --> 3097.92
i've developed all my ideas i've got

3096.16 --> 3101.44
them all in my head even if all my

3097.92 --> 3104.079
youtube was deleted i'd still have all

3101.44 --> 3106.96
those ideas right there i could like

3104.079 --> 3110.2000000000003
recreate all of it from scratch just

3106.96 --> 3110.2
like that

3113.68 --> 3117.7599999999998
shut up gorgeous i'm gonna ban you again

3122.16 --> 3128.5589999999997
unless you send me a paypal

3125.119 --> 3128.559
then you can be a smart ass

3133.76 --> 3141.76
oh so just money oh yes shadow god

3139.359 --> 3144.72
yes of course

3141.76 --> 3146.2400000000002
i mean that's the ultimate career move

3144.72 --> 3150.0
of course it is

3146.24 --> 3151.4399999999996
i mean you want to make money on youtube

3150.0 --> 3152.48
flat earth

3151.44 --> 3154.48
yes

3152.48 --> 3157.119
that's how you get rich

3154.48 --> 3160.4
that's how you get the wide audience you

3157.119 --> 3160.4
numpty [ __ ]

3160.559 --> 3165.88
like how [ __ ] dumb are you shadowguft

3166.079 --> 3169.04
it's [ __ ]

3170.24 --> 3176.64
like what kind of a career guy

3173.839 --> 3179.44
is sticking to youtube is gonna do it

3176.64 --> 3181.52
for the money and then be exclusively

3179.44 --> 3186.4
about flat earth that's the dumbest

3181.52 --> 3186.4
[ __ ] thing i've ever heard from you

3189.04 --> 3196.24
nobody said it was easy it's ridiculous

3193.68 --> 3200.16
if you're gonna do it for the money

3196.24 --> 3200.16
you're gonna pick anything else

3200.88 --> 3206.0
it's not that hard yeah it's really not

3204.0 --> 3207.44
that difficult to make money on youtube

3206.0 --> 3211.119
all you have to do

3207.44 --> 3214.16
is avoid sensitive triggering subjects

3211.119 --> 3216.2400000000002
or play into specific trigger porn type

3214.16 --> 3218.3999999999996
movements that are condoned which flat

3216.24 --> 3220.16
earth is not

3218.4 --> 3222.8
and then do that

3220.16 --> 3225.7599999999998
and you get loads of people you'll get a

3222.8 --> 3228.4
hundred thousand subscribers in no time

3225.76 --> 3230.2400000000002
people will just throw hundreds of

3228.4 --> 3232.7200000000003
dollars of super chats right in your

3230.24 --> 3234.319
face without even you asking it it

3232.72 --> 3238.319
happens yeah

3234.319 --> 3241.68
picking flat earth as a career subject

3238.319 --> 3245.119
for the money is the dumbest decision

3241.68 --> 3245.1189999999997
anybody could ever make

3247.52 --> 3254.24
it's probably the most financially

3251.119 --> 3255.599
discouraged subject to even tackle on

3254.24 --> 3258.64
youtube

3255.599 --> 3259.6800000000003
so are you gonna retract how incredibly

3258.64 --> 3261.44
dumb

3259.68 --> 3263.52
that statement was

3261.44 --> 3266.079
are you gonna retract that statement

3263.52 --> 3268.24
shadowguft because it's really [ __ ]

3266.079 --> 3271.2000000000003
dumb to say something like that

3268.24 --> 3273.839
that you're gonna do plat earth on

3271.2 --> 3276.0789999999997
youtube for the money

3273.839 --> 3280.64
it's the dumbest [ __ ] thing you could

3276.079 --> 3283.28
ever say here and anywhere else

3280.64 --> 3285.92
i'm rationalizing no

3283.28 --> 3290.0400000000004
i'm confronting you with how [ __ ]

3285.92 --> 3290.04
stupid that is

3292.96 --> 3300.96
you don't become rich

3296.4 --> 3303.52
by being a flat earth youtuber

3300.96 --> 3303.52
you don't

3303.599 --> 3307.52
that's why even the flat earthers that

3306.0 --> 3309.52
even have

3307.52 --> 3313.04
halfway decent income

3309.52 --> 3316.559
they do other things beside flat earth

3313.04 --> 3318.88
because those other things make money

3316.559 --> 3320.799
flat earth doesn't make money it might

3318.88 --> 3322.6400000000003
make you popular it might make you

3320.799 --> 3325.7599999999998
knowledgeable

3322.64 --> 3328.319
you may get a kind of a a loyal crowd

3325.76 --> 3330.559
even like me loyal crowd that's actually

3328.319 --> 3333.2799999999997
willing to like support me financially

3330.559 --> 3335.599
and i really need it right

3333.28 --> 3337.44
i'm not going to become rich of that

3335.599 --> 3339.44
it's idiotic

3337.44 --> 3342.4
the amount of effort you have to put

3339.44 --> 3343.68
into it versus how much money you get

3342.4 --> 3346.4
out of it

3343.68 --> 3348.48
is never a good deal

3346.4 --> 3352.319
if you're doing it for the money it's

3348.48 --> 3352.319
really dumb to say that

3353.92 --> 3359.04
right make more money being an anti-flat

3356.079 --> 3361.76
earther and it's a lot easier too

3359.04 --> 3363.599
because anti-flat earthers are [ __ ]

3361.76 --> 3364.6400000000003
they their crowd is [ __ ] all they

3363.599 --> 3366.88
have to do

3364.64 --> 3368.24
is keep repeating the same tropes over

3366.88 --> 3370.88
and over again

3368.24 --> 3372.16
be halfway good at bluffing peer

3370.88 --> 3374.0
pressure

3372.16 --> 3376.72
to make them feel poor to the crowd

3374.0 --> 3378.48
those retards that refuse to learn and

3376.72 --> 3381.04
they'll throw giant amounts of money at

3378.48 --> 3383.2
you because they got money aplenty

3381.04 --> 3386.5589999999997
they're all rich retards

3383.2 --> 3389.2
so yeah anti-flat earther for money yeah

3386.559 --> 3391.8390000000004
that's reasonable

3389.2 --> 3394.799
it still makes you a disgusting scumbag

3391.839 --> 3397.7599999999998
lying double speaking idiot

3394.799 --> 3400.64
but yeah for the money that is that is a

3397.76 --> 3403.76
credible option

3400.64 --> 3407.4
flat earth for the money is not a

3403.76 --> 3407.4
credible option

3421.599 --> 3427.2000000000003
yeah yeah but randy did some shady

3424.16 --> 3427.2
freaking deals man

3427.359 --> 3434.16
didn't you know zapped happy

3430.48 --> 3436.48
he was doing weird [ __ ]

3434.16 --> 3438.24
and allegedly

3436.48 --> 3441.28
in my view

3438.24 --> 3443.52
potentially criminal [ __ ] as well i

3441.28 --> 3446.1600000000003
don't know i can never prove that but he

3443.52 --> 3448.24
was doing some weird shady [ __ ] with

3446.16 --> 3450.64
money i think he might have been part of

3448.24 --> 3452.799
like a london money laundering operation

3450.64 --> 3456.5589999999997
that's why he got just insane amounts of

3452.799 --> 3458.559
money for absolutely nothing special

3456.559 --> 3460.6400000000003
i think he was just

3458.559 --> 3462.6400000000003
being a grifter

3460.64 --> 3467.16
that's what i think

3462.64 --> 3467.16
has nothing to do with flat earth

3477.68 --> 3483.2
david weiss is making a nice bug with

3479.599 --> 3486.4
his app yeah but he's a jew

3483.2 --> 3486.3999999999996
gadget inspector

3487.359 --> 3490.5589999999997
hello

3488.799 --> 3491.92
that's different

3490.559 --> 3493.44
and besides

3491.92 --> 3494.88
it's an app

3493.44 --> 3496.559
he made it

3494.88 --> 3499.04
he made the app

3496.559 --> 3502.48
he's good at distributing he's good at

3499.04 --> 3504.88
advertising as a very mellow averaged

3502.48 --> 3506.799
out attitude that is more appealing to a

3504.88 --> 3508.6400000000003
wider audience including the retards

3506.799 --> 3509.52
which doesn't matter to him

3508.64 --> 3511.5989999999997
right

3509.52 --> 3514.24
so yeah david weiss's app is pretty

3511.599 --> 3517.44
successful

3514.24 --> 3520.0789999999997
but he put a lot of effort in it as well

3517.44 --> 3524.0
and he is a jew they do know how to make

3520.079 --> 3524.0
money they do know how to do that

3524.799 --> 3529.7599999999998
right so it's different and he's it's

3527.28 --> 3532.4
not like he's getting that from his

3529.76 --> 3534.3190000000004
youtube channel it's not like oh man

3532.4 --> 3537.359
look at that no it's an app it's a

3534.319 --> 3540.64
separate thing from youtubing about flat

3537.359 --> 3542.5589999999997
earth you see he made it

3540.64 --> 3545.7599999999998
he's a jew

3542.559 --> 3547.599
it makes money good for him awesome

3545.76 --> 3550.1600000000003
has nothing to do with being a flat

3547.599 --> 3552.0
earther on youtube that on its own is

3550.16 --> 3555.5589999999997
not gonna make you pile the money it

3552.0 --> 3555.559
just never does

3564.319 --> 3569.04
yeah he did sleeping warrior infecto

3567.119 --> 3572.319
nonsense yeah he did

3569.04 --> 3574.079
what an ass

3572.319 --> 3576.04
is such a scummy

3574.079 --> 3582.869
bastard

3576.04 --> 3582.869
[Music]

3587.07 --> 3594.1800000000003
[Music]

3589.28 --> 3601.429
look how little i've even used this

3594.18 --> 3601.4289999999996

3614.48 --> 3621.04

3619.04 --> 3623.839
this toilet paper does not come i did

3621.04 --> 3625.599
stock up on toilet paper actually

3623.839 --> 3628.0
but it was hilarious because i did it

3625.599 --> 3629.76
right at the right moment because right

3628.0 --> 3631.839
after that

3629.76 --> 3633.92
for like half a week

3631.839 --> 3635.7599999999998
there was no toilet paper then after

3633.92 --> 3637.44
that half a week suddenly it got right

3635.76 --> 3640.0
back so it seemed like it was like an

3637.44 --> 3642.16
artificial stiffening

3640.0 --> 3644.24
but i did actually stock up on toilet

3642.16 --> 3646.799
paper and then it did run out for like

3644.24 --> 3648.9599999999996
half a week everywhere

3646.799 --> 3652.319
it's only half a week so

3648.96 --> 3652.319
didn't really matter that much

3655.2 --> 3659.7599999999998
nobody gets paid for being a jew and not

3657.68 --> 3662.3999999999996
saying that he got paid for being a jew

3659.76 --> 3663.92
he just knows how to make it because he

3662.4 --> 3666.92
is a jew

3663.92 --> 3666.92
dummy

3689.71 --> 3693.119
[Music]

3691.44 --> 3694.96
to do with our toilet paper because all

3693.119 --> 3698.88
the stores ran out

3694.96 --> 3702.559
well you could always settle for a b day

3698.88 --> 3702.559
but that does make you kind of gay

3703.68 --> 3709.68
but it will

3705.28 --> 3713.559
yeah it will save you on toilet paper

3709.68 --> 3713.5589999999997
i hoard it no

3722.0 --> 3725.319
that's hilarious

well that is kind of gross with the ink

3768.96 --> 3773.119

3778.96 --> 3783.039
i mean you're gonna get an inky butt if

3781.039 --> 3787.28
you keep doing that for a long time you

known as black butt

3852.64 --> 3856.359
yeah sleepy warrior

3877.44 --> 3880.4
yeah we just yeah that is just

3879.2 --> 3882.799
embarrassing

3880.4 --> 3886.559
selling toilet paper

3882.799 --> 3888.64
on ebay for high price that's just

3886.559 --> 3891.6400000000003
it's so pathetic that people would do

3888.64 --> 3891.64
that

3902.559 --> 3907.3590000000004
because look dude toilet paper is not

3905.359 --> 3912.319
even that hard to make

3907.359 --> 3912.319
overall okay it's just paper

3914.079 --> 3919.799
it's actually kind of like cheapish

3916.799 --> 3919.799
paper

3922.559 --> 3926.3190000000004
yeah

3924.4 --> 3927.599
i mean like oh we're gonna run out of

3926.319 --> 3930.0
toilet paper well that's just a

3927.599 --> 3932.48
supplier's problem because it's not like

3930.0 --> 3935.68
how are we ever gonna make that toilet

3932.48 --> 3938.319
paper that's such an impossible job only

3935.68 --> 3941.44
china has the factories to produce

3938.319 --> 3945.16
proper toilet paper dude

3941.44 --> 3945.16
it's not that difficult

3952.559 --> 3954.96
you know

3955.44 --> 3960.0
it's not like it's computer chips or

3957.44 --> 3962.079
something right it's just toilet paper

3960.0 --> 3965.68
so it's ridiculous the idea that you're

3962.079 --> 3968.6800000000003
like gonna run out forever something

3965.68 --> 3968.68
cool

3969.84 --> 3973.03
[Music]

3995.359 --> 3998.4
right

3996.48 --> 4000.319
nearly oh no yeah that's a good point

3998.4 --> 4001.839
yeah they wore a tune to be extremely

4000.319 --> 4003.7599999999998
efficient why

4001.839 --> 4005.52
because that is most environmentally

4003.76 --> 4007.2000000000003
friendly

4005.52 --> 4012.0
and

4007.2 --> 4015.1189999999997
just stabilizes it financially so yeah

4012.0 --> 4015.119
works very efficient

4017.92 --> 4021.039
and if you then

4019.2 --> 4022.64
if then something breaks down then it

4021.039 --> 4026.92
all kind of breaks down and suddenly

4022.64 --> 4026.92
doesn't flow anymore

4034.64 --> 4037.359
yeah indeed

4046.799 --> 4049.799
godzilla

4050.46 --> 4053.65
[Music]

4054.0 --> 4058.64
so you could say the tp demand is pretty

4056.88 --> 4060.1600000000003
regular

4058.64 --> 4063.839
oh dear

4060.16 --> 4063.839
did it come to this already

4086.64 --> 4089.2
right

4087.52 --> 4092.319
i want to talk about that for a second

4089.2 --> 4093.9199999999996
right the toilet paper shortage so

4092.319 --> 4097.359
what was that

4093.92 --> 4099.679
like literally what was that

4097.359 --> 4099.679
i mean

4099.759 --> 4104.279
could it have been like an anticipation

4104.64 --> 4108.2390000000005
more toilet paper

4107.04 --> 4112.319
because

4108.239 --> 4115.919999999999
it was cruel remember all that and then

4112.319 --> 4118.88
like everybody is expected to be snot

4115.92 --> 4121.359
nosy and use more toilet paper so did

4118.88 --> 4123.04
they just like say oh we need fifty

4121.359 --> 4125.1990000000005
percent more toilet paper and then the

4123.04 --> 4127.199
factory is like oh what we can't provide

4125.199 --> 4129.879999999999
that ah

4127.199 --> 4132.4
that caused the shortage because they

4129.88 --> 4134.64
anticipated we're going to need more

4132.4 --> 4136.799
toilet paper because everybody's going

4134.64 --> 4138.400000000001
to get coronu and then

4136.799 --> 4140.319
everybody's going to like have snotty

4138.4 --> 4142.719
noses is that the reason why that

4140.319 --> 4142.719
happened

4142.88 --> 4147.839
because then it would make halfway sense

4147.92 --> 4153.359
that they were just trying to plan and

4150.239 --> 4155.839
anticipate for corona and it just didn't

4153.359 --> 4160.279
work out because it was too fine-tuned

4155.839 --> 4160.2789999999995
to just run at a stable pace

4168.64 --> 4174.08
enough about the freaking wipes kepler

4171.52 --> 4176.64
we don't care how many times you have to

4174.08 --> 4176.64
do that

4176.719 --> 4179.12
thanks

4179.839 --> 4184.4
please don't talk about your ass

4183.04 --> 4187.4
in the chat

4184.4 --> 4187.4
okay

4213.52 --> 4216.88
right so

4214.56 --> 4219.52
so they didn't even

4216.88 --> 4221.6
logically anticipate more toilet paper

4219.52 --> 4222.200000000001
being needed they were just

4221.6 --> 4223.4400000000005
hoarding

4222.2 --> 4226.159
[Music]

4223.44 --> 4228.639999999999
in anticipation of like a collapse

4226.159 --> 4231.12
situation so they were kind of like

4228.64 --> 4233.679
creating a panic then is that it or in a

4231.12 --> 4233.679
cool

4234.88 --> 4239.36
yeah it was a joke kevlar it was a gross

4238.32 --> 4241.92
joke

4239.36 --> 4241.92
gross

4242.0 --> 4249.12
yeah i don't want to imagine

4245.199 --> 4251.839999999999
like mid-aged men's asses getting wiped

4249.12 --> 4254.84
in my chat thank you very much that's

4251.84 --> 4254.84
gross

4259.59 --> 4262.789
[Music]

4270.64 --> 4275.52
oh totally i don't care

4272.96 --> 4277.44
we're talking not about wiping your ass

4275.52 --> 4279.76
we're talking about the toilet paper

4277.44 --> 4283.839999999999
shortage and why it happened i'm not

4279.76 --> 4283.84
talking about ass wiping okay

4284.32 --> 4287.32
dumbass

4294.9 --> 4298.099999999999
[Music]

4309.84 --> 4314.64
petrol shortage yeah but orinoco the

4312.239 --> 4318.159
petrol short by the way

4314.64 --> 4320.8
remember toilet paper shortage was

4318.159 --> 4323.36
like two years ago remember

4320.8 --> 4325.4400000000005
this petrol shortage is much more recent

4323.36 --> 4327.679
is this year

4325.44 --> 4330.159
and

4327.679 --> 4331.6
it makes absolutely no sense it is a

4330.159 --> 4335.759999999999
deliberate

4331.6 --> 4337.6
industrial sabotage by the government

4335.76 --> 4340.0
right it's not an anticipation for

4337.6 --> 4342.56
anything they just like

4340.0 --> 4344.159
you you don't get to exist anymore oh

4342.56 --> 4346.159000000001
where are we getting our power from oh

4344.159 --> 4348.4
oh we're power shorted yeah yeah because

4346.159 --> 4351.12
you literally just turn this entire

4348.4 --> 4351.12
section off

4353.199 --> 4356.5599999999995
right

4354.239 --> 4360.08
so you can't really compare the toilet

4356.56 --> 4360.080000000001
paper shortage with like the

4362.239 --> 4366.32
with the petrol shortage it's not really

4364.56 --> 4369.1990000000005
the same

4366.32 --> 4369.199
angle of approach

4369.44 --> 4373.12
there was never any petrol yeah there

4371.04 --> 4375.12
still isn't it's just that it's this

4373.12 --> 4377.36
industrial sabotage that just being shut

4375.12 --> 4377.36
off

4381.679 --> 4384.96
ah later cortela see you at the flat

4383.92 --> 4387.679
earth debate

4384.96 --> 4387.679
super chats

4388.12 --> 4391.3099999999995
[Music]

4395.28 --> 4402.36
and yes kevlar i did call you a dumbass

4397.84 --> 4402.360000000001
but i did it as butthead so

4441.36 --> 4445.839999999999
increase in demand yes amen yeah do you

4444.239 --> 4447.5199999999995
know that that's what we're talking

4445.84 --> 4449.52
about it was just

4447.52 --> 4452.64
the demand was higher but it made no

4449.52 --> 4456.56
sense and the factories couldn't

4452.64 --> 4458.96
do it they were too fine-tuned

4456.56 --> 4459.92
so then suddenly a bigger demand causes

4458.96 --> 4463.04
a

4459.92 --> 4463.04
blockage an issue

4463.679 --> 4467.4
and then there's a shortage

4481.36 --> 4485.36
what do you mean jeff guess that the

4482.88 --> 4487.12
petrol has been changed had to get rid

4485.36 --> 4490.44
of old stock

4487.12 --> 4490.44
what do you mean

4500.719 --> 4505.92
ring laser gyroscope dude yeah yeah

4503.04 --> 4508.719
september and you were completely wrong

4505.92 --> 4508.719
the entire

4508.8 --> 4513.6
it's not a ring laser gyroscope

4511.92 --> 4515.679
it doesn't measure them what the hell

4513.6 --> 4517.4800000000005
are you talking about

4515.679 --> 4520.159
you brought up

4517.48 --> 4524.32
gyrocompasses yesterday and i discussed

4520.159 --> 4527.44
it with with the flat earth baiters

4524.32 --> 4529.199
and yeah qe had already dealt with it

4527.44 --> 4533.44
other people had and just everything

4529.199 --> 4537.04
that is said even in wikipedia about

4533.44 --> 4540.4
the uh gyrocompass is a complete

4537.04 --> 4543.28
lie and it makes absolutely no sense

4540.4 --> 4546.239
it is turned into a machination just

4543.28 --> 4548.8
like what they did with coriolis effect

4546.239 --> 4550.879999999999
that is my conclusion

4548.8 --> 4553.84
i don't even remember you bringing up

4550.88 --> 4556.719
the ring laser gyroscope

4553.84 --> 4559.4400000000005
but you see you now certainly saying

4556.719 --> 4561.199
you've changed your stance about flat

4559.44 --> 4563.28
earth

4561.199 --> 4565.28
it has no message to me

4563.28 --> 4567.759999999999
like anybody could say that i do you

4565.28 --> 4569.759999999999
think you're the you would be the first

4567.76 --> 4571.52
anti-flat earther to try and trick a

4569.76 --> 4573.360000000001
flat earther by saying oh i'm flat

4571.52 --> 4575.679
earther now

4573.36 --> 4578.08
no no you're not so you're gonna have to

4575.679 --> 4581.1990000000005
prove it

4578.08 --> 4584.4
gonna have to lay down

4581.199 --> 4585.919999999999
a sacrifice on the altar of flat earth

4584.4 --> 4588.239
and show you

4585.92 --> 4590.8
you actually you're real and you're

4588.239 --> 4594.48
willing to actually go there

4590.8 --> 4596.8
so go on the flat earth debate

4594.48 --> 4599.759999999999
discord

4596.8 --> 4602.08
and join the flat earth debate

4599.76 --> 4604.96

about your revelation of flat earth and

4604.96 --> 4609.92
let's see

4606.719 --> 4611.679
if if you're genuine

4609.92 --> 4615.0
or if you're a dick that's going to be

4611.679 --> 4615.0
banned tomorrow

4634.239 --> 4641.199
dude what are you talking about tony

4636.96 --> 4643.84
condoning my lies what lies

4641.199 --> 4645.919999999999
oh wait you were talking to zap to happy

4643.84 --> 4649.04
okay i did see that

4645.92 --> 4649.04
i'm being polite

4649.6 --> 4653.6
i'm not really condoning his lies though

4656.56 --> 4661.92
i'm just saying

4658.96 --> 4665.04
you gotta prove it

4661.92 --> 4666.2390000000005
yeah i mean seriously just imagine a war

4665.04 --> 4667.76
let's say

4666.239 --> 4670.0
world war ii

4667.76 --> 4672.96
not with nazis specifically but just

4670.0 --> 4676.239
soldiers and just a german soldier

4672.96 --> 4677.199
and a english soldier

4676.239 --> 4679.44
and then

4677.199 --> 4682.48
the german soldier comes over doesn't

4679.44 --> 4686.08
have any nazi symbols or [ __ ]

4682.48 --> 4688.5599999999995
and it's like oh yes i want to

4686.08 --> 4690.159
uh defect i want to i want out of this

4688.56 --> 4691.6
war

4690.159 --> 4695.28
you think that they're going to be oh

4691.6 --> 4697.360000000001
dude yes okay well we were about to like

4695.28 --> 4699.12
go and raid this you want to join up

4697.36 --> 4700.88
with us

4699.12 --> 4703.76
no

4700.88 --> 4704.84
because it could be a trick

4703.76 --> 4706.400000000001
you

4704.84 --> 4709.4400000000005
see

4706.4 --> 4712.32
you're not just gonna take them on

4709.44 --> 4713.839999999999
your mission right away

4712.32 --> 4715.44
first they gotta be

4713.84 --> 4717.360000000001
secured

4715.44 --> 4720.0
figured out

4717.36 --> 4721.679
processed

4720.0 --> 4723.04
they're probably never going to join the

4721.679 --> 4726.32
war again

4723.04 --> 4727.76
because even then they could still be a

4726.32 --> 4730.96
spy

4727.76 --> 4733.76

dousing people like zept happy in

4789.52 --> 4793.679

4815.28 --> 4820.429999999999
muggle

4817.19 --> 4820.429999999999
[Music]

that's hilarious

4833.44 --> 4839.919999999999
tony does that mean that

4835.36 --> 4839.92
the flat earth debate is hogwarts now

4840.08 --> 4845.719
i knew it

4841.76 --> 4845.719
i am a wizard

4846.88 --> 4849.88
is

4869.84 --> 4874.2390000000005
did i have to throw him out yes

4872.159 --> 4877.12
yes i did have to throw him out or naka

4874.239 --> 4879.28
wumbo because he was literally lying to

4877.12 --> 4879.28
us

4879.76 --> 4885.92
he was trying to trick us into thinking

4882.48 --> 4888.32
he was a flat earther making effort

4885.92 --> 4889.28
so he was lying to us i don't want him

4888.32 --> 4893.679
here

4889.28 --> 4897.239
if he's gonna be a deceiving liar

4893.679 --> 4897.2390000000005
i hate liars

4914.8 --> 4920.0
i'm not harwin

4916.8 --> 4920.0
screw you rick back

4920.159 --> 4924.0
i'm an elf i'm not harry

4929.04 --> 4933.6
i'm like the arrogant blonde guy

4932.159 --> 4935.599999999999
that thinks he's that has white

4933.6 --> 4937.280000000001
privilege but he actually has white

4935.6 --> 4938.8
privilege because he is better than

4937.28 --> 4940.32
everybody else and everybody else is

4938.8 --> 4945.84
giving him a hard time because they're

4940.32 --> 4945.84
all infected with the sjw mindset virus

4948.4 --> 4953.36
i like the blonde guy in harry potter

4950.96 --> 4956.639
harry potter better

4953.36 --> 4959.839999999999
like oh he's the bully oh i actually

4956.639 --> 4959.84
think he's the cool kid

4960.159 --> 4964.0
am i the only one that ever thought that

4966.88 --> 4972.0
i never liked harry potter not even the

4968.96 --> 4973.52
first ones

4972.0 --> 4975.36
it's just the whole thing is so it

4973.52 --> 4978.080000000001
turned inside out and it's just so

4975.36 --> 4978.08
palpable

4978.8 --> 4982.8
to me

4979.679 --> 4984.88
so my empathy is like empathy bells or

4982.8 --> 4988.88
alarms are going off all over the place

4984.88 --> 4991.04
every time i see those movies every time

4988.88 --> 4993.1990000000005
it's just like no there's like weird

4991.04 --> 4997.04
[ __ ] going on here it's hidden right in

4993.199 --> 4997.04
plain sight you don't even realize it

4998.639 --> 5003.52
although the general premise

5001.84 --> 5005.12
is interesting

5003.52 --> 5007.679
right like ooh

5005.12 --> 5010.0
the world in between a world

5007.679 --> 5012.96
where you can do that and like the oh we

5010.0 --> 5015.76
have to the moguls versus the wizards

5012.96 --> 5018.4
i like that i like the

5015.76 --> 5020.96
the social structures that have come out

5018.4 --> 5025.12
of it those are interesting

5020.96 --> 5027.04
but the actual story the actual figures

5025.12 --> 5028.88
i think they're kind of creepy

5027.04 --> 5032.08
like

5028.88 --> 5034.719
just creepy like sneaky sneaky being

5032.08 --> 5037.92
creepy without you knowing it and never

5034.719 --> 5037.92
being led on to that

5038.56 --> 5043.84
it's always creepiness hidden in plain

5040.56 --> 5046.56
sight without ever telling you

5043.84 --> 5048.32
new stranger things tomorrow ooh

5046.56 --> 5050.320000000001
cool

5048.32 --> 5053.32
that should be interesting

5050.32 --> 5053.32
enough

5075.84 --> 5080.4400000000005
okay borders boy good for you

5096.639 --> 5099.6
you know he was lying or in a yeah okay

5098.639 --> 5103.76
arena

5099.6 --> 5104.639
i get it maybe you did have some privy

5103.76 --> 5106.639
to

5104.639 --> 5108.719
earlier insights about him it's just

5106.639 --> 5110.56
that zapdappi and me do have a bit of a

5108.719 --> 5112.719
history he's been around my channel for

5110.56 --> 5114.88
a long time until he just acted

5112.719 --> 5115.92
completely out of control and just

5114.88 --> 5118.639
wouldn't

5115.92 --> 5120.32
adapt to what i needed for the show

5118.639 --> 5123.76
wouldn't adapt to my format anymore and

5120.32 --> 5127.199
that's why i banned him originally

5123.76 --> 5129.4400000000005
but even if somebody else knows that a

5127.199 --> 5132.32
person is lying

5129.44 --> 5133.28
i still got to give them a chance

5132.32 --> 5135.5199999999995
why

5133.28 --> 5138.239
because they need to admit it to

5135.52 --> 5138.2390000000005
themselves

5138.32 --> 5143.12
so i will just keep inquiring assuming

5140.88 --> 5145.04
that they're not lying even though the

5143.12 --> 5147.84
chance that they are lying is extremely

5145.04 --> 5150.239
high because i gotta give them a chance

5147.84 --> 5150.2390000000005
you see

5151.76 --> 5155.719
that's just how i do things

5157.199 --> 5163.08
that's the new band name

5160.08 --> 5163.08
what

5181.84 --> 5183.92
you

5201.44 --> 5207.159
none of your [ __ ] business

5203.84 --> 5207.159000000001
gun bag

5236.159 --> 5239.839999999999
their butt hurt very much

5274.239 --> 5279.08
okay

5275.679 --> 5279.08
adam price

5281.04 --> 5283.36
uh

5286.32 --> 5291.12
which is much more difficult right now

5288.96 --> 5293.28
although it was still hot

5291.12 --> 5295.76
and then whoa the time has flown

5293.28 --> 5300.5199999999995
that's been actually a

5295.76 --> 5300.52
kind of an interesting fluid show today

5308.32 --> 5311.679
but

5309.28 --> 5314.08
industrial infrastructure

5311.679 --> 5316.639
mostly discussing about that so it has

5314.08 --> 5318.239
been very contemporary not very

5316.639 --> 5320.56
esoteric

5318.239 --> 5322.638999999999
but yeah you can always have an esoteric

5320.56 --> 5325.76
show every single day because then you

5322.639 --> 5326.96
become detached from the earthly too

5325.76 --> 5329.12
much

5326.96 --> 5331.199
right you gotta remember you're always

5329.12 --> 5333.36
here and now

5331.199 --> 5335.5199999999995
so however big

5333.36 --> 5338.4
the grip is you gain in a moment and

5335.52 --> 5339.76
enjoy that oversight and the glory of

5338.4 --> 5342.08
the creation

5339.76 --> 5343.6
don't forget you're also still the

5342.08 --> 5346.239
person you are

5343.6 --> 5348.719
within the time frame you are needing to

5346.239 --> 5351.04
do what you need to do

5348.719 --> 5354.32
don't forget about that part too it's

5351.04 --> 5357.679
just as important as the giant visionary

5354.32 --> 5359.5199999999995
oversights that you might attain

5357.679 --> 5362.4
through

5359.52 --> 5362.400000000001
introspection

5362.96 --> 5367.28
uh but i'm gonna round out the show

5367.84 --> 5372.08
so

5368.96 --> 5375.84
by the way did anybody

5372.08 --> 5379.4
actually have any comments about say

5375.84 --> 5379.400000000001
my show yesterday

5379.6 --> 5383.1990000000005
or even back the day before

5387.76 --> 5391.679
but yeah yesterday show was a specific

5390.8 --> 5393.6
item

5391.679 --> 5396.0
show

5393.6 --> 5397.92
i wish i had more comments in response

5396.0 --> 5400.4
to it

5397.92 --> 5402.2390000000005
like i seriously don't get like why for

5400.4 --> 5404.4
example

5402.239 --> 5407.44
matt from quantum of conscious gets like

5404.4 --> 5409.36
hundreds and hundreds of comments

5407.44 --> 5412.48
very quickly

5409.36 --> 5415.199
and i don't get any

5412.48 --> 5415.199
barely any

5415.6 --> 5419.52
that surprises me

5418.56 --> 5420.88
i mean

5419.52 --> 5423.679
effectively

5420.88 --> 5425.92
quantum of punches is a flat earther as

5423.679 --> 5425.92
well

5429.44 --> 5433.759999999999
i don't understand why i get so little

5431.76 --> 5436.320000000001
comments it's it's a lot of anti-flat

5433.76 --> 5439.92
earther trolls just trying to ruin the

5436.32 --> 5441.5199999999995
[ __ ] i get a lot of ad spam too spanish

5439.92 --> 5443.76
[ __ ] i think

5441.52 --> 5443.76
but

5444.32 --> 5450.4
where is all the commenters the actual

5447.92 --> 5453.6
people that actually

5450.4 --> 5455.04
try to follow my show

5453.6 --> 5457.4400000000005
where are you

5455.04 --> 5460.0
like is listening in the distance all

5457.44 --> 5463.04
you will ever do with me just listen in

5460.0 --> 5464.96
the distance and walk away

5463.04 --> 5466.56
are you actually going to give me a sign

5464.96 --> 5469.36
that i'm not just talking to the

5466.56 --> 5469.360000000001
darkness here

5469.6 --> 5474.8
with my high level of inquiry and

5472.639 --> 5476.400000000001
thinking

5474.8 --> 5478.400000000001
and my

5476.4 --> 5480.879999999999
esoteric

5478.4 --> 5483.759999999999
fractal insights

5480.88 --> 5485.1990000000005
that apply like in the most important

5483.76 --> 5488.639
times

5485.199 --> 5491.04
i'd like to get some feedback

5488.639 --> 5493.52
that would be great you see

5491.04 --> 5494.8
i'm basically putting my life's work

5493.52 --> 5495.84
efforts

5494.8 --> 5498.56
into

5495.84 --> 5500.2390000000005
these ideas and my shows it would be

5498.56 --> 5503.4400000000005
great

5500.239 --> 5505.919999999999
if i got any kind of signal that

5503.44 --> 5507.44
anybody's actually listening taking

5505.92 --> 5510.56
notes

5507.44 --> 5512.96
that what i do matters to anybody it

5510.56 --> 5515.120000000001
would be great if i knew that right it's

5512.96 --> 5516.159
nice to be supported financially and all

5515.12 --> 5519.12
that

5516.159 --> 5521.08
it's like okay that's that's cool

5519.12 --> 5524.4
but i'd like some

5521.08 --> 5525.6
intellectual connection

5524.4 --> 5527.44
please

5525.6 --> 5530.639
that would be great

5527.44 --> 5533.28
don't be afraid of me getting a bit

5530.639 --> 5534.96
rowdy maybe against you i'm like that

5533.28 --> 5536.96
with everybody

5534.96 --> 5538.88
when it comes to intellectual matters

5536.96 --> 5542.08
i'm always like that

5538.88 --> 5543.4400000000005
forward i'm not gonna be super super

5542.08 --> 5547.12
soft

5543.44 --> 5549.839999999999
right it's just not the way i am but any

5547.12 --> 5552.96
level of feedback would be great

5549.84 --> 5555.360000000001
unless everybody in the world really

5552.96 --> 5556.56
wants me just to shut the [ __ ] up

5555.36 --> 5558.88
forever

5556.56 --> 5562.719
if that's really what you want then by

5558.88 --> 5564.88
all means don't ever leave a comment

5562.719 --> 5566.4
don't ever leave a comment just leave it

5564.88 --> 5569.4400000000005
blank

5566.4 --> 5570.719
for months and years and nobody ever

5569.44 --> 5573.12
comment then

5570.719 --> 5575.36
all right

5573.12 --> 5577.84
i don't even know any other channel that

5575.36 --> 5580.159
has this many subscribers and this

5577.84 --> 5582.159000000001
amount of regular viewers in the live

5580.159 --> 5583.36
shows that just has

5582.159 --> 5584.879999999999
no

5583.36 --> 5587.28
comments

5584.88 --> 5591.28

i have not seen a single youtube channel

5591.28 --> 5595.12
out there like that

5593.199 --> 5597.678999999999
yeah channels that have like

5595.12 --> 5599.84
50 subscribers and do something yeah

5597.679 --> 5601.4400000000005
okay they might have just one commenter

5599.84 --> 5602.639

5626.639 --> 5631.52
have to keep removing them constantly

distance oh that's great
