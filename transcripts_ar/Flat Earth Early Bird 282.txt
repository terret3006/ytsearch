6.25 --> 36.32
[Music]

36.8 --> 45.36

40.89 --> 46.71
early-bird number 282 I'm your host

45.36 --> 48.66
Arwen and before we start the show

46.71 --> 49.77

48.66 --> 51.69
platform you deem fit

49.77 --> 53.400000000000006
and if you haven't already subscribed to

51.69 --> 55.62

the super Chad's paypal patreon and my

63.12 --> 69.99
GoFundMe will be much appreciated so

65.729 --> 76.31
today again it's it's a pretty amazing

69.99 --> 80.08999999999999
day but then they started cam trailing

76.31 --> 81.99000000000001
and I don't really like that at all

80.09 --> 84.42
especially because it seems to be

81.99 --> 88.44
hanging around with this lack of wind so

84.42 --> 92.61
there's a little of it so you know

88.44 --> 95.49
despite that it's taking away some of

92.61 --> 99.9
the blue but they're still it's still

95.49 --> 103.69999999999999
just a lovely sunny day might need to be

99.9 --> 111.0
careful in the evening staying outside

103.7 --> 117.24000000000001
I'd have to decline anyway how are you

111.0 --> 122.82
all doing I have with me today tumeric

117.24 --> 129.349
coffee yeah I got a lot of stuff I got

122.82 --> 134.45
tea I got blueberries

129.349 --> 140.959
I got a tangerine and I got a not a

134.45 --> 143.32899999999998
peach but the lemon tine the other one

140.959 --> 149.72
that's not hairy tastes very similar

143.329 --> 157.01000000000002
anyway yeah

149.72 --> 161.989
let's see who's in chat today so stone

157.01 --> 165.379
monkey 3d was first had some questions

161.989 --> 168.139
about weight and how would cannot

165.379 --> 179.91899999999998
exclude little G blah blah blah whatever

168.139 --> 184.62900000000002
a DM Steve mozzarellas miss Amanda you

179.919 --> 195.29000000000002
delete delete shall Tibet John Watson

184.629 --> 197.659
yeah good to see you all so yeah today I

195.29 --> 201.10899999999998
got a big check from Google

197.659 --> 203.41899999999998
ray not not unusually big but apparently

201.109 --> 205.04000000000002
it took a while before all the super

203.419 --> 211.09900000000002
Jets like the big bomb and everything

205.04 --> 215.989
came through from funds from Samhain so

211.099 --> 218.89999999999998
I got a yeah almost 300 euros so that I

215.989 --> 221.269
know it in the end it will be taken away

218.9 --> 226.549
again but it just means some breathing

221.269 --> 228.739
room for now so that felt kind of good

226.549 --> 239.37900000000002
and I thought okay I give myself a

228.739 --> 239.37900000000002
little treat a Hello sleeping warrior

240.92 --> 247.39999999999998
[Music]

242.12 --> 249.739
medium matrix media good to see ya hey

247.4 --> 250.91
Thank You Sean Tibet for the two-pound

249.739 --> 255.79
suit but you had the nation

250.91 --> 255.79
Tibet's my way much appreciated

256.87 --> 270.44
so today's Thursday was weird it felt

267.29 --> 271.33000000000004
like it was Friday but yeah it doesn't

270.44 --> 274.52
really matter

271.33 --> 277.15999999999997
yesterday was really good day for me

274.52 --> 279.71
also was just great weather and the air

277.16 --> 281.47900000000004
was nice there were no chemtrails in

279.71 --> 286.669
retrospect at all didn't even take

281.479 --> 290.38
notice of it in the morning a good air

286.669 --> 293.24
and yeah my paper round was just fine

290.38 --> 295.04
that was a bit weird on the debates I

293.24 --> 298.639
felt in retrospect here of myself back

295.04 --> 302.57
in the evening I'm getting like this

298.639 --> 305.54
weird jittery thing again yeah I need to

302.57 --> 308.57
stop doing that anyway it's pretty tough

305.54 --> 310.45000000000005
to get in on the debates these days I

308.57 --> 313.82
don't know why but Google seems to be

310.45 --> 316.65999999999997
deep prioritizing my microphone when

313.82 --> 319.669
people are speaking through one another

316.66 --> 323.87
that's kind of disappointing and I get

319.669 --> 325.49
frustrated sometimes but oh well it's

323.87 --> 327.669
still good show it's still good to be

325.49 --> 327.669
there

331.6 --> 336.25
All Right see you later stone monkey 3d

340.0 --> 349.34
I went to bed early yesterday really

344.3 --> 351.77000000000004
early I now I remember yeah I haven't

349.34 --> 354.79999999999995
watched anything pretty much

351.77 --> 357.97999999999996
I just even just before the show started

354.8 --> 360.95
watching Owen Benjamin because yeah I I

357.98 --> 366.17
was on the debates paper round then I

360.95 --> 367.64
started cooking and that took a lot of

366.17 --> 371.63
time then I ate it

367.64 --> 377.71999999999997
then I went to bed so I barely did

371.63 --> 380.09
anything media wise but I did come

377.72 --> 383.29
across another arty article that I

380.09 --> 383.28999999999996
thought was kind of interesting

386.02 --> 393.32
concerning cryptocurrency it's weird

390.44 --> 397.36
because it's something that I've been

393.32 --> 400.15999999999997
trying to remind I guess people of or

397.36 --> 402.2
echoing the warning because I wasn't the

400.16 --> 405.68
first one to come up with this that's

402.2 --> 408.77
not not crypto expert by by a longshot

405.68 --> 412.19
but I have paid attention to people like

408.77 --> 415.19
for example Max Keiser who's really dug

412.19 --> 416.78
into that and yeah think of the guy

415.19 --> 418.49
whatever you want but he's been going at

416.78 --> 420.44
it forever and I've just been following

418.49 --> 424.43
him like even in the early days he was a

420.44 --> 427.07
very reliable financial source just to

424.43 --> 430.28000000000003
understand financial things on the Alex

427.07 --> 433.94
Jones Show and since after a certain

430.28 --> 436.07
time they split apart and but he's still

433.94 --> 438.23
there on Russia today sometimes she

436.07 --> 442.71999999999997
still has his own show so I do keep

438.23 --> 442.72
doing watch into that sometimes

446.98 --> 456.11
but anyway the article let's see let me

450.44 --> 457.82
share this oh wow what am i Amanda young

456.11 --> 460.55
thank you so much for that

457.82 --> 463.19
$10 super chair donation good morning

460.55 --> 465.43
Arwen keep up the great show I will

463.19 --> 479.27
thank you so much I definitely will with

465.43 --> 484.88
all your support okay all right so it's

479.27 --> 487.4
kind of a yeah it caught my artistic eye

484.88 --> 492.73
in the subject let me see if I can

487.4 --> 492.72999999999996
optimize this because this looks kind of

493.72 --> 500.6
all right get the advertisement out of

497.75 --> 502.84
the way so you create a nuclear power

500.6 --> 505.40000000000003
plant used to mine cryptocurrency

502.84 --> 511.07
putting state secrets at risk

505.4 --> 514.76
okay that's but just that photo alone I

511.07 --> 516.89
think it's amazing look at that the

514.76 --> 521.81
weird thing about it is this is some

516.89 --> 523.58
high-tech [ __ ] but in an old style and I

521.81 --> 527.66
don't know anything about what I'm

523.58 --> 529.7900000000001
seeing here but I get it I get what

527.66 --> 532.49
that's supposed to mean what its

529.79 --> 535.4
function is it's like the most typical

532.49 --> 538.64
controls are down and the higher up you

535.4 --> 541.0699999999999
go the more intricate you you have the

538.64 --> 543.83
details and why they do it is that I

541.07 --> 547.6600000000001
just get it I don't trust me on this

543.83 --> 551.1500000000001
it's so efficient how they made this

547.66 --> 553.85
just that picture alone because oh when

551.15 --> 556.4599999999999
something goes wrong it's a real hassle

553.85 --> 558.2900000000001
to find the error as it were especially

556.46 --> 561.589
in situation with the nuclear power

558.29 --> 565.61
plant supposedly so then every issue

561.589 --> 567.74
should be reflected in a Y like from

565.61 --> 569.839
everything something goes wrong you

567.74 --> 572.24
notice it downstairs where you're mostly

569.839 --> 575.6300000000001
focused at as operator and then it's

572.24 --> 578.089
yeah you can reference some of the

575.63 --> 579.15
middle panel and then yeah if you really

578.089 --> 582.0
need

579.15 --> 584.1899999999999
fix something quick you look it up on

582.0 --> 587.75
the on the highest panel that that's how

584.19 --> 591.089
I think they offer it anyway dudes just

587.75 --> 593.76
buttons I used to have a bit of a

591.089 --> 597.71
fascination with interfaces with buttons

593.76 --> 600.96
it reflected a lot in my Legos days

597.71 --> 604.0500000000001
anyway what this article is basically

600.96 --> 606.69
about is it says in Ukraine weirdly

604.05 --> 611.3389999999999
enough somebody secretly

606.69 --> 614.1300000000001
kind of used the extra energy they had

611.339 --> 617.61
to mind their own cryptocurrency

614.13 --> 624.9
and they literally used the system to do

617.61 --> 629.22
that secretly why what a silly thing to

624.9 --> 633.87
do you would say well because Bitcoin

629.22 --> 638.21
and all that it drains incredible

633.87 --> 642.32
amounts of energy to do all that yes

638.21 --> 646.8000000000001
it's one of the most wasteful computing

642.32 --> 649.47
actions imaginable with some of the

646.8 --> 654.3299999999999
really big ones like Bitcoin which is

649.47 --> 657.0600000000001
just a bloated thing and it's terrible

654.33 --> 659.1600000000001
and so I don't think yeah of course

657.06 --> 661.0799999999999
through the security risk Babylon is

659.16 --> 663.39
secretly did that okay that's kind of

661.08 --> 665.85
weird but just that somebody that's

663.39 --> 668.4
something you could do and it requires

665.85 --> 673.1700000000001
the energy yeah that's a that's a nice

668.4 --> 676.02
little scheme but just look how much

673.17 --> 678.36
energy it would actually require to

676.02 --> 683.4
build on that it's just insane

678.36 --> 685.74
and I think personally and people are

683.4 --> 687.89
gonna immediately point at me again oor

685.74 --> 692.73
when what are you doing I think

687.89 --> 695.33
cryptocurrencies should be limited in a

692.73 --> 699.51
way in the sense that if

695.33 --> 701.61
cryptocurrencies will end up inevitably

699.51 --> 704.79
draining huge amounts of energy to

701.61 --> 710.28
produce and aren't restricted in some

704.79 --> 712.649
other way then yeah those types of

710.28 --> 715.29
cryptocurrencies should be bad

712.649 --> 717.869
basically my opinion because otherwise

715.29 --> 720.1189999999999
it's literally gonna suck all the energy

717.869 --> 724.7090000000001
out of the world if we're going to go

720.119 --> 729.769
with this and a lot of groups are power

724.709 --> 734.189
groups including so it's just bad news

729.769 --> 736.139
it's literally yeah yeah oh we have to

734.189 --> 738.66
risk the brownouts because we got to

736.139 --> 744.569
have a little bit more cash that it's

738.66 --> 749.129
totally insanity anyway yeah that

744.569 --> 755.6289999999999
happened apparently it's not and I

749.129 --> 755.629
thought I'd share that with you guys

755.99 --> 765.689
yeah this age you know cryptocurrencies

760.619 --> 769.8290000000001
are great blockchain ideas crypto kurtal

765.689 --> 772.74
that but you can't design something that

769.829 --> 774.3889999999999
is then gonna literally eat the energy

772.74 --> 785.2090000000001
out of everything that's just totally

774.389 --> 788.37
irresponsible and now on the other hand

785.209 --> 790.29
the dangers of my approach to say okay

788.37 --> 794.2090000000001
there has to be some kind of regulations

790.29 --> 797.759
to prevent energy destruction brownouts

794.209 --> 801.1199999999999
it we'll all day yeah of course you know

797.759 --> 804.689
who the ones that always do that they

801.12 --> 807.48
will then start to try to narrow it down

804.689 --> 809.939
to one single cryptocurrencies that

807.48 --> 812.879
should then be the world standard and

809.939 --> 815.009
big groups may even try to compete to

812.879 --> 819.299
make the rare cryptocurrency the world

815.009 --> 825.7090000000001
standard that unfortunately is what that

819.299 --> 828.48
will inevitably lead to but maybe as

825.709 --> 830.549
long as cryptocurrencies are completely

828.48 --> 833.16
unregulated that could just be this

830.549 --> 836.1
awareness spread about it like look into

833.16 --> 839.1189999999999
the crime capital currency what is it

836.1 --> 845.49
you're investing in are you investing in

839.119 --> 846.39
blood crypto or are you investing in in

845.49 --> 850.83
like

846.39 --> 853.14
yeah efficient crypto in in green crypto

850.83 --> 856.2
thank god this sounds terrible okay so

853.14 --> 858.6
it's your crypto green or is it red if

856.2 --> 860.5500000000001
it's red then it means that consume the

858.6 --> 863.279
huge amount of energy and think of the

860.55 --> 867.4799999999999
global warming in the oh my god but yeah

863.279 --> 869.279
if you don't think about it just keep on

867.48 --> 873.0600000000001
going like that brownouts it's just

869.279 --> 877.67
basic economics really energy is a thing

873.06 --> 881.0699999999999
don't make it a rare resource by using

877.67 --> 884.43
blood crypto basically that that's my

881.07 --> 886.7700000000001
message I hope it spreads god

884.43 --> 889.649
I don't know who's gonna latch onto that

886.77 --> 894.81
and potentially abuse it but it's just a

889.649 --> 897.63
fact you got to keep Kryptos energy

894.81 --> 903.3599999999999
efficient otherwise that just they

897.63 --> 907.58
become a brownout hazard risk so that's

903.36 --> 907.58
my message about crypto for today

915.5 --> 922.649
alright and I did look into that because

918.149 --> 925.89
I am also dealing in crypto in a sense

922.649 --> 929.43
that not yet my dad has engaged he's

925.89 --> 934.829
learning about it the GTI company that

929.43 --> 938.9399999999999
we are part of is standardizing that

934.829 --> 941.43
it's like it's they have to basically

938.94 --> 943.74
because of the attacks from all sides

941.43 --> 947.31
from the bankers and lawyers it's like

943.74 --> 950.399
the more efficient way out for now it's

947.31 --> 952.3499999999999
pretty heavy stuff and exciting and I

950.399 --> 954.57
definitely do not know all the details

952.35 --> 957.24
nor would I like to share that just on

954.57 --> 961.4100000000001
YouTube like that don't know even if

957.24 --> 963.69
that's allowed at this point but yeah

961.41 --> 965.3389999999999
cryptocurrency you got to know if you're

963.69 --> 968.0400000000001
gonna be dealing in didn't know the

965.339 --> 972.649
cryptocurrency know where it came from

968.04 --> 977.0
where I will lead to gotta understand

972.649 --> 980.42
become you could almost compare it to

977.0 --> 982.16
trading in metal coins you know if you

980.42 --> 983.75
have a really good gold then yeah you

982.16 --> 985.4599999999999
can check it and then you know this is

983.75 --> 988.43
really good go this is a good gold piece

985.46 --> 990.6500000000001
but if you just take any metal just

988.43 --> 992.4499999999999
because it's kind of shiny who knows you

990.65 --> 996.89
might get some seriously mercury

992.45 --> 1000.61
polluted [ __ ] you know so you need to

996.89 --> 1005.56
test it si goes for the crypto currency

1000.61 --> 1007.9300000000001
you need to know what it is why did you

1005.56 --> 1015.39
lead - because that is predictable

1007.93 --> 1015.39
always with every crypto currency design

1016.79 --> 1019.8199999999999
[Music]

1022.2 --> 1031.81
all right PJ this is exit time this

1027.339 --> 1035.49
stuff is no joke okay my dad's been a

1031.81 --> 1041.4099999999999
guitar self-employed guitar teacher for

1035.49 --> 1044.26
holyfield over 50 years yeah he's had

1041.41 --> 1047.1000000000001
the real even finger injuries and [ __ ]

1044.26 --> 1054.1299999999999
he's done a lot of things he's been

1047.1 --> 1056.32
playing for big audience and he's gone

1054.13 --> 1059.47
into alternative healing and it's it's

1056.32 --> 1062.98
all it's called branching you know

1059.47 --> 1066.3700000000001
there's a cooperation between my dad and

1062.98 --> 1069.34
my mother-in-law also has a beauty

1066.37 --> 1075.01
company beauty clinic a very very good

1069.34 --> 1077.05
one she's she's special and he does

1075.01 --> 1079.93
alternative healing and studies and

1077.05 --> 1083.47
that's also serious it sounds kind of

1079.93 --> 1085.41
hokey pokey whatever it's not it's very

1083.47 --> 1089.44
deep it's high-tech

1085.41 --> 1094.1200000000001
in an obscure region where there is a

1089.44 --> 1097.39
lot of information if you just can just

1094.12 --> 1100.4199999999998
step away from the regular and just look

1097.39 --> 1103.0900000000001
into it in the studies it's fascinating

1100.42 --> 1105.46
anyway and he's done a lot of successful

1103.09 --> 1107.4289999999999
work at it with leaving a lot of

1105.46 --> 1112.109
satisfied customers

1107.429 --> 1114.2
because he's been at it for I think for

1112.109 --> 1117.1789999999999
almost a decade now with that and

1114.2 --> 1119.309
besides that also it's been just looking

1117.179 --> 1124.8890000000001
into financial like he has still had

1119.309 --> 1128.369
time left over so I just thought yeah

1124.889 --> 1130.7389999999998
let's go into the GTI a similar type of

1128.369 --> 1132.6899999999998
issues and then things got wrote yeah

1130.739 --> 1134.3990000000001
didn't always went great you know he

1132.69 --> 1135.049
tried things out some turn out to be a

1134.399 --> 1138.9599999999998
scam

1135.049 --> 1141.4189999999999
it was very careful still and this one

1138.96 --> 1144.089
was just this one was the real one

1141.419 --> 1153.3890000000001
and we are if we've been on it for years

1144.089 --> 1156.71
now and we we definitely got something

1153.389 --> 1160.82
out of it that made it all worthwhile so

1156.71 --> 1166.3790000000001
and that's just it so yeah not a job

1160.82 --> 1170.6689999999999
officially it is a job that's the silly

1166.379 --> 1173.279
thing about it it's just that I've

1170.669 --> 1179.0990000000002
chosen not to withdraw money from it

1173.279 --> 1183.089
directly I am kind of true yet bypassing

1179.099 --> 1186.029
that by doing things with my dad and

1183.089 --> 1191.82
that's allowed and it's just everything

1186.029 --> 1194.369
is just working just right and I'm

1191.82 --> 1196.6789999999999
managing and I'm growing and my

1194.369 --> 1198.359
subscribers keep on growing and I'm very

1196.679 --> 1200.1190000000001
satisfied about that and I got all the

1198.359 --> 1202.859
support so everything is just hunky-dory

1200.119 --> 1204.899
as far as I'm concerned sometimes get a

1202.859 --> 1207.119
little especially when I'm financially

1204.899 --> 1212.2689999999998
short in a moment when I'm like in a in

1207.119 --> 1214.799
a pit waiting yeah that's not nice

1212.269 --> 1217.169
but yeah when that goes away and it

1214.799 --> 1219.839
always does I'm just fine and I realized

1217.169 --> 1222.5990000000002
yeah things are in order there's it's

1219.839 --> 1228.529
not just perfectly steady all the time I

1222.599 --> 1228.529
get it you gotta reconcile with it so

1228.559 --> 1234.529
now we're all doing fine here how are

1232.409 --> 1234.529
you

1245.549 --> 1253.1689999999999
let me jack back to chat because I've

1248.98 --> 1253.169
ignored you for a while sorry about that

1263.16 --> 1268.6000000000001
yeah the look the littleit I would

1266.47 --> 1271.75
normally completely agree the funny

1268.6 --> 1275.53
thing is though that that banks do

1271.75 --> 1278.8
accept cryptocurrency and you can then

1275.53 --> 1282.67
try and change it into money so yeah oh

1278.8 --> 1288.3999999999999
it may be worthless but you can trade it

1282.67 --> 1291.1200000000001
for money and use that so I don't see

1288.4 --> 1291.1200000000001
the problem really

1325.99 --> 1333.64
why would I want to say describe

1330.26 --> 1333.64
anything Effy Vader

1334.0 --> 1341.06
why would I describe the atmosphere

1337.61 --> 1341.57
without an antecedent why would I do

1341.06 --> 1348.08
that

1341.57 --> 1350.9299999999998
that your question makes no sense it

1348.08 --> 1353.4199999999998
seems more like a frustration for the

1350.93 --> 1355.8700000000001
inability to maneuver beyond a certain

1353.42 --> 1355.8700000000001
block

1365.99 --> 1374.75
delete well digital savings why would

1370.59 --> 1374.75
you use it as digital savings

1380.85 --> 1387.059
that's the thing about currency it's

1384.539 --> 1393.69
really not worth anything unless you do

1387.059 --> 1397.289
something with it if you're gonna

1393.69 --> 1400.44
consider it is savings yeah that that if

1397.289 --> 1403.98
I'd have to like save a lot I'd rather

1400.44 --> 1407.179
save it in gold for example that doesn't

1403.98 --> 1410.029
mean that I can't use cryptocurrency and

1407.179 --> 1413.8790000000001
maybe try a little mining on the side

1410.029 --> 1419.269
because whatever or just trade I don't

1413.879 --> 1419.269
know I'm still really new to it all

1422.389 --> 1425.389
right

1429.77 --> 1437.59
because it's digital what you mean like

1433.48 --> 1442.85
the numbers of your bank account because

1437.59 --> 1445.6299999999999
that's all so did you know although you

1442.85 --> 1450.32
can change it into paper if you like a

1445.63 --> 1457.9
little metal coins but it's pretty much

1450.32 --> 1461.57
digital the only difference is that that

1457.9 --> 1464.929
the fiat currency is under full control

1461.57 --> 1467.33
over of whoever controls the bank that

1464.929 --> 1470.5700000000002
regulates that so somebody suddenly

1467.33 --> 1473.6899999999998
decides that there is going to be a lot

1470.57 --> 1475.3999999999999
of printing of money and everybody on

1473.69 --> 1477.38
the top agrees with that they're just

1475.4 --> 1479.1200000000001
going to freaking do it and the people

1477.38 --> 1482.5590000000002
can do nothing about it that's the

1479.12 --> 1482.559
difference with cryptocurrency

1491.63 --> 1506.5
crash hey stop wasting my time

1520.1 --> 1524.54
hello duck michael ratner stefan

1522.62 --> 1526.87
Alderson that were at a meeting by the

1524.54 --> 1526.87
way also

1536.31 --> 1544.62
right yeah delete delete you're correct

1540.89 --> 1547.8000000000002
look the state could potentially invest

1544.62 --> 1553.6799999999998
in mining cryptocurrency as well if they

1547.8 --> 1557.07
choose to do so but that's not on the

1553.68 --> 1560.88
same scale as just being able to

1557.07 --> 1565.1699999999998
certainly print thousands of times as

1560.88 --> 1567.15
much money just by adding three zeros to

1565.17 --> 1569.13
the total amount as it were and then

1567.15 --> 1571.89
just start printing or whatever you know

1569.13 --> 1577.44
that's much easier comparatively to do

1571.89 --> 1582.15
than to just make absurd amount of

1577.44 --> 1585.3200000000002
cryptocurrencies so that that was all

1582.15 --> 1588.8300000000002
thought of by the people that the

1585.32 --> 1592.26
thought of the idea of cryptocurrency

1588.83 --> 1597.72
it's that it's naturally it has natural

1592.26 --> 1599.97
safe fail fail safes but some are

1597.72 --> 1603.27
limited it's not without its long-term

1599.97 --> 1605.52
issues as for example I said with the

1603.27 --> 1607.74
energy consumption that it will

1605.52 --> 1610.44
eventually always start to consume more

1607.74 --> 1612.57
and more energy so in my personal

1610.44 --> 1616.13
opinion it would be best if there was

1612.57 --> 1616.1299999999999
some kind of regulation on that

1629.59 --> 1632.34
hmm

1632.6 --> 1639.53
by the way I think there's probably a

1636.62 --> 1642.5
pretty easy mechanism to do that by

1639.53 --> 1645.29
simply switching getting a

1642.5 --> 1648.02
cryptocurrency version 1 and version 2

1645.29 --> 1652.27
then version 3 to follow up like plants

1648.02 --> 1655.04
they grow then create the new one and

1652.27 --> 1658.04
then allow pretty much everyone to

1655.04 --> 1660.61
translate it in an exchange with also

1658.04 --> 1662.3899999999999
like yeah that old cryptocurrency will

1660.61 --> 1665.33
be abandoned

1662.39 --> 1667.22
at a certain point so people would

1665.33 --> 1669.53
naturally transit then the new

1667.22 --> 1671.39
cryptocurrency grows from that it would

1669.53 --> 1674.6
be like a plant cycle that could work

1671.39 --> 1679.5800000000002
and would limits that in yet it would

1674.6 --> 1682.6399999999999
stop over growing a cryptocurrency it's

1679.58 --> 1686.51
very easy basically to just do it like

1682.64 --> 1689.39
that that's also a thing

1686.51 --> 1692.53
cryptocurrencies can simply be abandoned

1689.39 --> 1695.5300000000002
if people choose to do so or

1692.53 --> 1695.53
organizations

1696.31 --> 1701.69
[Music]

1697.93 --> 1705.53
that's not something yes what is it

1701.69 --> 1707.48
state currencies fiat currency it's not

1705.53 --> 1710.51
something you could just do with that

1707.48 --> 1712.76
and with cryptocurrencies it would be a

1710.51 --> 1715.19
lot easier to do that so isn't yet

1712.76 --> 1716.27
another advantage yeah I don't know why

1715.19 --> 1721.43
but I'm just talking about

1716.27 --> 1728.72
cryptocurrency yesterday a chocolate

1721.43 --> 1735.71
saying crypto will lead to chip implants

1728.72 --> 1739.8700000000001
my god well did you know there's already

1735.71 --> 1743.18
places I think in Rotterdam where they

1739.87 --> 1747.4699999999998
basically pay you to sit on a bench and

1743.18 --> 1749.93
allow your body heat to be absorbed by

1747.47 --> 1753.23
the bench and that's going to be used to

1749.93 --> 1755.15
power the creation of cryptocurrency

1753.23 --> 1759.95
that's a real thing that's been out

1755.15 --> 1762.3200000000002
there for a while and hey if somebody

1759.95 --> 1765.41
wants look I want to do that then they

1762.32 --> 1765.6399999999999
can yeah sure make it even easier but

1765.41 --> 1767.049
you

1765.64 --> 1772.2
putting a chip on your head and then

1767.049 --> 1772.2
doing that it's totally insane but yeah

1772.95 --> 1776.49
it's crazy

1780.66 --> 1786.179
it's the the transhuman mindset

1807.02 --> 1821.54
oh yeah apparently there was also news

1817.1 --> 1827.48
that a Russian humanoid robot blast off

1821.54 --> 1830.59
to the ISS so yeah they're sending the

1827.48 --> 1830.59
robots to space now

1844.75 --> 1852.4
yeah maybe I should show that for a

1846.92 --> 1852.4
moment hold on let me let me get it

1859.3 --> 1869.37
I'm a little slow with the finding my

1863.26 --> 1869.37
way around here all right

1871.14 --> 1880.5590000000002
you you pretty cool picture I do have to

1878.73 --> 1887.1
say that I am kind of charmed by this

1880.559 --> 1890.3999999999999
this Russian robot design doesn't have

1887.1 --> 1894.1399999999999
the same feel as all those what is it

1890.4 --> 1898.14
those walking dogs and everything from

1894.14 --> 1902.3700000000001
what's the name again from Boston

1898.14 --> 1906.75
Dynamics that thing anyway Russian you

1902.37 --> 1909.7199999999998
enoyed robots I wonder if he's gonna

1906.75 --> 1912.41
have a non stop camera function rolling

1909.72 --> 1912.41
all the time

1925.139 --> 1929.579
okay that's not working

1932.62 --> 1935.62
mm-hmm

1950.29 --> 1954.21
come on that's kind of cool right

1962.49 --> 1969.54
I think that's pretty impressive really

1966.14 --> 1973.22
you know robotics will be robotics and I

1969.54 --> 1975.3899999999999
think this is pretty look pretty decent

1973.22 --> 1977.91
although I wonder what they're gonna do

1975.39 --> 1980.73
with it on the ISS maybe that robots

1977.91 --> 1982.8200000000002
going to be the new r2d2 of the ISS

1980.73 --> 1987.54
they're going to be floating around now

1982.82 --> 1993.95
until one of the rope snaps it has the

1987.54 --> 1993.95
live transmission oh dear

2012.1 --> 2017.4399999999998
I wonder by the way if that thing is

2014.56 --> 2020.5
completely waterproof because if they're

2017.44 --> 2023.02
actually gonna use it on the outside of

2020.5 --> 2026.97
the ISS it would kind of need to be

2023.02 --> 2026.97
waterproof if you know what I mean I

2031.16 --> 2038.43
[Music]

2040.17 --> 2045.5800000000002
said I still I'm I'm just trying to

2043.45 --> 2048.79
picture like how where are they

2045.58 --> 2052.48
proceeding and I'm thinking that if they

2048.79 --> 2054.58
have like these robots like this that

2052.48 --> 2057.25
you can directly interface with like

2054.58 --> 2061.59
with a suit it's like really science

2057.25 --> 2065.02
fiction high-tech kind of feel then

2061.59 --> 2071.7000000000003
International Swimming station nice then

2065.02 --> 2075.55
they could eventually somehow maybe

2071.7 --> 2078.2799999999997
build a set up where people could

2075.55 --> 2082.9
genuinely go and they'd somehow managed

2078.28 --> 2084.6400000000003
to get a gravity less types of credulous

2082.9 --> 2086.8
type situation where they'd somehow

2084.64 --> 2088.96
suspend it without an airplane without

2086.8 --> 2092.9500000000003
go doing or the vomit comet thingy or

2088.96 --> 2096.28
whatever maybe they'd find some kind of

2092.95 --> 2098.9199999999996
what is it anti-static field effect that

2096.28 --> 2101.34
would be sufficient to do it I don't

2098.92 --> 2103.39
know and then with these robots

2101.34 --> 2106.78
interfaces on the outside they could

2103.39 --> 2109.66
basically fake people going to a space

2106.78 --> 2111.52
station and then just would all seem

2109.66 --> 2114.0099999999998
like space they'd never have any

2111.52 --> 2116.95
necessity ever to go outside because

2114.01 --> 2120.07
they could simply do outside interfaces

2116.95 --> 2122.6499999999996
with the robot the virtual camera it

2120.07 --> 2125.92
would be very convincing satisfying

2122.65 --> 2128.07
nobody would be the wiser and eventually

2125.92 --> 2130.66
they'd return and have a genuine witness

2128.07 --> 2135.27
testimony about it because they really

2130.66 --> 2135.27
thought it was real anyway this is

2137.52 --> 2144.6
maybe that's I always thought they would

2141.01 --> 2149.23
try something like that you know I I

2144.6 --> 2153.85
imagine they just want real non lie

2149.23 --> 2164.16
based genuine testimony to make the

2153.85 --> 2167.47
belief real for real or maybe maybe

2164.16 --> 2169.66
that's even to wishful thinking for me

2167.47 --> 2172.0899999999997
maybe they just really don't care and

2169.66 --> 2174.22
that's just how I interpreted what they

2172.09 --> 2176.02
could do with it potentially and they

2174.22 --> 2176.68
don't really care that much I don't know

2176.02 --> 2180.31
what it is

2176.68 --> 2182.3199999999997
anyway they do definitely make progress

2180.31 --> 2188.2799999999997
with robotics and that's a very cool

2182.32 --> 2188.28
thing that's I'm all for that

2189.78 --> 2195.25
although yeah to replace everything with

2192.91 --> 2199.75
robotics would bring certain issues with

2195.25 --> 2201.94
it and will so but that's a whole nother

2199.75 --> 2207.19
debate and I've talked about with many

2201.94 --> 2212.32
people over the years like what if

2207.19 --> 2214.42
robotics became really efficient and so

2212.32 --> 2217.21
efficient that it would be almost as

2214.42 --> 2219.19
easy to get robots for all kinds of

2217.21 --> 2222.07
purposes as it would be to get a mobile

2219.19 --> 2223.9
phone now you know what I mean that

2222.07 --> 2227.05
could have come that don't underestimate

2223.9 --> 2228.73
it but what would happen what are the

2227.05 --> 2230.59
dangers well the dangers are plenty and

2228.73 --> 2232.54
obvious so many science fiction movies

2230.59 --> 2237.61
have been made warning from all kinds of

2232.54 --> 2242.07
angles but then again how could you

2237.61 --> 2245.8
manage it what would it look like what

2242.07 --> 2250.9
would be left for Humanity when robotics

2245.8 --> 2253.3
takes certain parts of activity away

2250.9 --> 2256.39
from the humans how would we cope how

2253.3 --> 2259.7200000000003
would we adapt in a sensible way could

2256.39 --> 2264.25
that be done or is it like an inevitable

2259.72 --> 2266.83
doom is it really I think it's something

2264.25 --> 2271.41
that we're all going to be forced to

2266.83 --> 2271.41
think about in the next 50 200 years all

2279.299 --> 2284.119
a Karen B

2289.57 --> 2292.57
lumberjack

2302.89 --> 2313.81
right anyway

2307.609 --> 2313.81
cryptocurrency robotics tangerines

2329.26 --> 2335.7000000000003
[Music]

2330.45 --> 2335.7
the silly conceptual microparticles

2382.359 --> 2386.88
I have a lot of good memories from

2384.219 --> 2386.88
tangerines

2414.16 --> 2425.1189999999997
so anyway anybody wants to bring up a

2421.849 --> 2426.739
subject or anything I have a question

2425.119 --> 2428.589
that I haven't already answered a

2426.739 --> 2437.63
thousand times in the last few weeks

2428.589 --> 2444.619
that would be great oh my good memories

2437.63 --> 2447.4100000000003
oh well it's just as a little kid when

2444.619 --> 2450.38
my family would go places or visit

2447.41 --> 2452.5389999999998
family of some sort I had a lot of still

2450.38 --> 2456.079
have some family but anyway my parents

2452.539 --> 2459.1090000000004
visited as a family unit and everything

2456.079 --> 2461.9500000000003
and a lot of these people that I liked

2459.109 --> 2465.7889999999998
had tangerines so it would always be

2461.95 --> 2465.7889999999998
like a warm welcome

2498.27 --> 2508.59
a F earth fader I think you need to

2504.92 --> 2510.21
consider taking your anti-psychotic

2508.59 --> 2514.1400000000003
medication again because what you're

2510.21 --> 2517.88
saying right now is just it's it's

2514.14 --> 2517.8799999999997
worrying let's just say it like that

2531.46 --> 2537.01
Crookes radiometer what's that

2538.9 --> 2547.42
never heard of that lumberjack what does

2541.79 --> 2547.42
that crypto neutrinos

2564.04 --> 2570.6
sorry I don't have any balloons it had a

2568.21 --> 2570.6
meeting

2579.06 --> 2582.709
ooh

2579.59 --> 2582.7090000000003
[Music]

2583.18 --> 2586.18
hmm

2597.14 --> 2608.93
yeah enough of that right

2609.34 --> 2619.05
Oh from fiora up both phases hypothesis

2615.43 --> 2619.0499999999997
sorry theory offices

2622.76 --> 2628.8390000000004
crooks right radium oh I'll try to

2625.79 --> 2628.839
google it

2633.95 --> 2637.06
[Music]

2646.74 --> 2649.6699999999996
okay

2658.12 --> 2669.1
okay so it's basically four little

2662.32 --> 2675.42
squares suspend it around some kind of

2669.1 --> 2675.42
wire in a glass tube that correct

2680.55 --> 2683.1800000000003
huh

2689.069 --> 2696.829
ah okay thanks ah damn it I hate it when

2694.469 --> 2696.829
it does that

2700.62 --> 2703.5499999999997
sheesh

2721.89 --> 2733.64
that dude really needs there's something

2725.359 --> 2740.959
about his diet Oh interesting huh a

2733.64 --> 2743.959
light windmill is that what it is that's

2740.959 --> 2743.959
fascinating

2754.339 --> 2766.189
right so it's like a mechanical light

2761.9 --> 2770.589
sale thing is that what originally NASA

2766.189 --> 2774.67
thought up as using for a long-distance

2770.589 --> 2779.63
propulsion for Space Systems

2774.67 --> 2781.5190000000002
besides solar panels I think not

2779.63 --> 2783.9390000000003
probably not anyway yeah fascinating

2781.519 --> 2786.939
little gadget

2783.939 --> 2786.939
interesting

2798.1 --> 2806.63
[Music]

2801.14 --> 2811.91
yeah maybe I'll show it why not just at

2806.63 --> 2814.36
one part where it's actually doing the

2811.91 --> 2814.3599999999997
spinning

2826.21 --> 2832.48
what did he do that I'll sit here no

2835.13 --> 2838.599
just talking a lot

2846.68 --> 2850.3289999999997
there's little hand signs

2856.92 --> 2866.56
where was it I can't seem to find the

2862.75 --> 2873.07
part where he's actually shining the

2866.56 --> 2877.89
light on it this is ridiculous did he do

2873.07 --> 2883.77
it all the way in the beginning no right

2877.89 --> 2883.77
yeah he did right

2893.98 --> 2896.73
hmm

2912.88 --> 2918.699
fascinating

2915.5 --> 2918.699
[Music]

2935.83 --> 2940.29
when was he going to use the real

2937.6 --> 2940.29
flashlight

2950.35 --> 2955.75
yeah Chris buried the link Karen B post

2953.41 --> 2963.66
a bit just earlier so just check out

2955.75 --> 2969.63
here it is it's pretty cool

2963.66 --> 2969.6299999999997
anyway I'll post it in chat again

2979.4 --> 2985.2490000000003
yeah okay that's pretty much it it's in

2982.099 --> 2988.809
the first three minutes so yeah

2985.249 --> 2988.8089999999997
interesting thanks for sharing that

2988.839 --> 2993.549
looks like an interesting little device

3009.26 --> 3013.5400000000004
what are you talking about Dave Johnson

3017.31 --> 3021.9
do you think that all these

3019.64 --> 3027.15
organizations are getting evolved to

3021.9 --> 3032.76
fool a few flat-earthers really it seems

3027.15 --> 3036.54
like you've just stepped 180 degrees

3032.76 --> 3038.88
wrong there it's just don't you get it

3036.54 --> 3042.2599999999998
it's not the fool of flat earthers it's

3038.88 --> 3042.26
the fool the ballers

3047.46 --> 3051.96
to keep them going to keep the dream

3049.619 --> 3055.44
going to keep the investments going to

3051.96 --> 3058.23
keep the record budget for biggest

3055.44 --> 3063.4700000000003
organized financed public finance

3058.23 --> 3072.39
organization in human history going

3063.47 --> 3075.8089999999997
that's why they're doing it there's a

3072.39 --> 3078.319
lot of money in big spells for the big

3075.809 --> 3078.3190000000004
public

3099.85 --> 3102.42
what

3111.54 --> 3116.41
all right

3113.95 --> 3118.66
I don't I don't get your point really

3116.41 --> 3124.14
deaf Johnson what does that have to do

3118.66 --> 3124.14
with big companies having a lot of power

3124.38 --> 3128.92
don't you get it it's always about more

3127.21 --> 3135.4
that's what it's all about

3128.92 --> 3139.059
it's ground they treat space and science

3135.4 --> 3141.069
fiction like an orchard and people buy

3139.059 --> 3144.51
into this they get caught up and they

3141.069 --> 3147.64
plant themselves in this orchard and

3144.51 --> 3150.8190000000004
then just keep it going until those

3147.64 --> 3154.45
people those fool people yield all their

3150.819 --> 3158.47
fruits to them and by big time to become

3154.45 --> 3163.72
a closer part to the dream that's what

3158.47 --> 3166.39
that is doesn't have anything to do with

3163.72 --> 3169.359
any big organizations having a lot of

3166.39 --> 3173.49
money they've got their own ways to get

3169.359 --> 3173.49
what they want their big pile

3183.93 --> 3193.96
yeah yeah Dave Johnson I don't just

3187.9 --> 3197.6800000000003
think it I know it because real real

3193.96 --> 3200.92
knowledge real discovery that's like on

3197.68 --> 3203.02
the edge you don't share that in public

3200.92 --> 3205.109
nobody in the right mind in the

3203.02 --> 3209.05
condition the world is in would do that

3205.109 --> 3213.31
because of how far it's already at we've

3209.05 --> 3216.19
discovered too much to be able to manage

3213.31 --> 3224.0499999999997
in this world that's probably pretty

3216.19 --> 3226.48
wide opinion it's also true we need to

3224.05 --> 3229.1800000000003
get the demons out first or they will

3226.48 --> 3236.29
use all this revelation all these things

3229.18 --> 3241.0499999999997
to destroy us and everything oh you want

3236.29 --> 3241.05
to come on the show Chris sure

3247.93 --> 3251.589
let me find you

3257.75 --> 3263.72
if you say hello in Skype quickly that

3261.47 --> 3266.6299999999997
would work I do all my hair there you

3263.72 --> 3270.3999999999996
are I do all my calls through Skype only

3266.63 --> 3270.4
I don't use Google systems anymore

3270.49 --> 3276.3799999999997
they're all broken so I hope you're

3274.73 --> 3281.78
answering because I'm gonna call you up

3276.38 --> 3293.08
now though you don't seem to be online

3281.78 --> 3293.0800000000004
just yet just wait until you say hello

3310.59 --> 3318.6800000000003
no Dave Johnson look I don't know if

3314.31 --> 3321.66
you're consciously doing this but you're

3318.68 --> 3325.14
trying to guess like me trying to hand

3321.66 --> 3327.21
out the paranoid angle view to how it's

3325.14 --> 3331.56
everything supposed to be now no no

3327.21 --> 3335.48
that's what you need us to be in order

3331.56 --> 3345.57
for you to somehow justified your

3335.48 --> 3348.15
[ __ ] fantasy world okay so no that's

3345.57 --> 3352.53
what it is and a lot of teachers will

3348.15 --> 3355.53
just teach it they don't even know that

3352.53 --> 3357.8100000000004
it's just a lot of nonsense stuck in

3355.53 --> 3360.86
between there they just play the book

3357.81 --> 3363.75
that's what they're taught to do and

3360.86 --> 3366.1200000000003
then there's some really smart teachers

3363.75 --> 3372.21
as well and when they figure it out it's

3366.12 --> 3373.7999999999997
all [ __ ] well usually they just shut up

3372.21 --> 3375.06
because they know if they're gonna

3373.8 --> 3378.1400000000003
forward that they're going to

3375.06 --> 3382.31
immediately be fired disgraced and just

3378.14 --> 3386.37
because that works and that does happen

3382.31 --> 3392.54
sometimes or gradually does happen has

3386.37 --> 3395.85
happened in the past so they don't know

3392.54 --> 3397.68
most people now I don't think they

3395.85 --> 3400.23
really know or they know and they're

3397.68 --> 3404.1499999999996
just not saying because they know if

3400.23 --> 3406.8
they if they go against the the dream

3404.15 --> 3409.23
they'll be disgraced they'll be targeted

3406.8 --> 3414.0600000000004
that we flagged that's still the case

3409.23 --> 3422.22
very much so policies are adapted to do

3414.06 --> 3425.21
this officially now that's the thing

3422.22 --> 3425.2099999999996
Dave Johnson

3428.189 --> 3434.019
that means you have no education if you

3431.529 --> 3437.769
don't believe anything that's you don't

3434.019 --> 3443.4889999999996
get it you're not supposed to believe

3437.769 --> 3445.0589999999997
the teacher okay that is what a [ __ ]

3443.489 --> 3448.679
[ __ ]

3445.059 --> 3453.6400000000003
does what you're supposed to do is

3448.679 --> 3456.069
listen to what the teacher says and then

3453.64 --> 3459.429
figure out what they're talking about

3456.069 --> 3461.259
and then if you dare to go one step

3459.429 --> 3463.089
beyond and you do have the actual

3461.259 --> 3464.919
cognitive ability to do that and see

3463.089 --> 3471.729
what's going on then you're gonna have

3464.919 --> 3474.1299999999997
to decide are you gonna inquire further

3471.729 --> 3477.189
into this do you really want to know or

3474.13 --> 3483.549
are you just gonna pass it by let the

3477.189 --> 3486.219
[ __ ] be the [ __ ] if you believe your

3483.549 --> 3489.519
teacher you're a [ __ ] you need to

3486.219 --> 3493.059
listen to your teacher and listen to

3489.519 --> 3497.3689999999997
what they say reflect upon it figure it

3493.059 --> 3501.159
out find out what they're talking about

3497.369 --> 3505.1690000000003
does it make any damn sense what are

3501.159 --> 3505.1690000000003
their sources where did they get it from

3509.74 --> 3517.9399999999996
because I was invited to Jason McCormick

3513.17 --> 3525.77
don't don't repeat yourself like that

3517.94 --> 3528.83
please somebody said something about a

3525.77 --> 3532.81
device and that video happened to show

3528.83 --> 3532.81
that device that's it

3541.19 --> 3546.42
because yeah just to clarify still back

3544.589 --> 3549.5589999999997
about the whole story with the teachers

3546.42 --> 3553.0190000000002
and everything if you have a teacher and

3549.559 --> 3556.5890000000004
they're teaching you something and you

3553.019 --> 3560.359
are blindly absorbing everything they

3556.589 --> 3563.849
say in order to perfectly repeat it

3560.359 --> 3568.97
you're not engaging in learning you are

3563.849 --> 3573.539
engaging in indoctrination based

3568.97 --> 3575.91
memorization excluding the critical

3573.539 --> 3580.4700000000003
thought in order to perfect the copy of

3575.91 --> 3584.269
it that's not really learning you're not

3580.47 --> 3588.8689999999997
developing your consciousness you just

3584.269 --> 3594.2099999999996
insert things into it not really looking

3588.869 --> 3598.2290000000003
at it maybe looking in a remote dreamy

3594.21 --> 3602.089
way making it more about the feelings

3598.229 --> 3602.089
instead of the critical thought

3612.6 --> 3617.88
I think that Tony is saying something

3615.21 --> 3619.89
that I've also been said said that had

3617.88 --> 3625.1400000000003
could be on the possibilities although I

3619.89 --> 3627.33
just severely doubt that earth is a ball

3625.14 --> 3634.14
of any kind in a literal sense

3627.33 --> 3638.0699999999997
look I've in my first hangout ever 2016

3634.14 --> 3640.62
I showed it I said the bottom list of

3638.07 --> 3644.3
all the possibilities the flat globe

3640.62 --> 3647.48
okay and you're never gonna you're never

3644.3 --> 3650.88
the people that are now ballers and are

3647.48 --> 3656.93
retarding out going all demonic they

3650.88 --> 3659.6400000000003
will never get it never ever

3656.93 --> 3665.0
they will never let it go

3659.64 --> 3668.31
never ever they will drive their

3665.0 --> 3671.12
retardation into their grave because

3668.31 --> 3675.7799999999997
they can never accept that it's not a

3671.12 --> 3679.65
literal globe even if geometrically the

3675.78 --> 3683.4
flat space may interconnect so really in

3679.65 --> 3686.9100000000003
a surreal fashion that could somehow

3683.4 --> 3688.8
indicate that well you could it's not a

3686.91 --> 3692.46
globe but you can think of it as a globe

3688.8 --> 3694.6800000000003
because it does kind of the mind does

3692.46 --> 3697.8
make you want to think it is because

3694.68 --> 3700.47
it's just so close to it and that's the

3697.8 --> 3710.3100000000004
problem that's why they're never gonna

3700.47 --> 3713.6
get it ever never because I think it is

3710.31 --> 3713.6
probably a flat globe

3716.67 --> 3724.63
well it's even deceptive to say that but

3719.86 --> 3728.98
I could this it would be more like a

3724.63 --> 3731.44
weirdly cut out shape of a globe that

3728.98 --> 3733.63
could then be assembled into a globe

3731.44 --> 3736.81
shape but in its literal sense it's not

3733.63 --> 3739.5
it's just that special linearity is kind

3736.81 --> 3742.81
of weird and not very linear as

3739.5 --> 3744.94
everybody would naturally assume yeah

3742.81 --> 3747.7599999999998
and there's just people that are never

3744.94 --> 3753.82
ever going to be able to reconcile with

3747.76 --> 3756.55
that they will either go mad or they

3753.82 --> 3758.67
will walk away cuz they can never handle

3756.55 --> 3758.67
it

3770.08 --> 3780.0699999999997
mm no not still not seeing Chris berry

3776.86 --> 3780.07
to add

3784.04 --> 3789.08
ooh I think low buses at low buses I

3787.13 --> 3792.1400000000003
think and Nate ball-busters

3789.08 --> 3800.47
debate oh good as did you what is that

3792.14 --> 3800.47
oh wait for him here what's going on

3800.59 --> 3804.53
anyway

3802.1 --> 3807.0499999999997
yeah it's Thursday the Flat Earth debate

3804.53 --> 3809.6200000000003
should be going alive right now I've

3807.05 --> 3813.82
been going on for over an hour I think

3809.62 --> 3816.74
yeah so I'm gonna round out the show I I

3813.82 --> 3818.15
hope you liked it as much as I did I had

3816.74 --> 3822.47
it I thought it was a pretty good at

3818.15 --> 3824.81
conversation and put down some some of

3822.47 --> 3828.83
the more complicated issues also that we

3824.81 --> 3831.47
all have to deal with eventually it is

3828.83 --> 3833.9
basically what I'm predicting and even I

3831.47 --> 3837.62
have kind of doubt just roughly saying

3833.9 --> 3840.11
it is this because it makes me feel like

3837.62 --> 3842.5099999999998
peach shade to do that and I don't want

3840.11 --> 3846.46
to be like that I just know it's gonna

3842.51 --> 3848.8
go somewhere because I've seen it and

3846.46 --> 3853.91
never forgot that part

3848.8 --> 3857.0600000000004
divisions so it's the world the realm is

3853.91 --> 3862.31
surreal and that's just that's just the

3857.06 --> 3865.18
way it is and the weird thing is we

3862.31 --> 3868.25
should all be glad that it is

3865.18 --> 3872.89
unfortunately some people just don't see

3868.25 --> 3875.84
the value of such a thing of

3872.89 --> 3879.3399999999997
complication even because it is the

3875.84 --> 3882.4700000000003
challenge if everything was exactly as

3879.34 --> 3885.8900000000003
is and there were no aberrations within

3882.47 --> 3889.3999999999996
creation life would be pretty damn dull

3885.89 --> 3893.87
I think where would the mind have to

3889.4 --> 3896.9900000000002
wonder almost nowhere so I think it is

3893.87 --> 3899.87
just part of the creation and it's just

3896.99 --> 3901.6699999999996
a kind of difficult new level the mind

3899.87 --> 3908.29
would have to go on in order to just

3901.67 --> 3910.88
grab grasp what this realm is so anyway

3908.29 --> 3913.82
thanks everyone for coming and watching

3910.88 --> 3915.79
