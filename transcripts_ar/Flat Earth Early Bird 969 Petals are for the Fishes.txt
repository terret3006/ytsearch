join button that will be much

81.84 --> 86.22
appreciated

83.759 --> 89.72
so

86.22 --> 89.72
whether today is

90.96 --> 93.74
the

95.28 --> 102.78
some really clear blue sky spots up

99.659 --> 105.54
there but also very vast

102.78 --> 109.46000000000001
thick Cloud Banks and the wind's going

105.54 --> 109.46000000000001
pretty quick up there

109.92 --> 113.34
so

111.96 --> 115.38
yeah

113.34 --> 116.93900000000001
rain comes out of some of these big

115.38 --> 120.14
clouds and that's why there's still

116.939 --> 120.13999999999999
puddles laying around

121.92 --> 126.6
imagine that that big cloud over there

124.32 --> 127.55999999999999
there's there's probably rain coming out

126.6 --> 129.29999999999998
of that

127.56 --> 133.099
over there

129.3 --> 133.09900000000002
but right here it seems

133.739 --> 137.9
not so thick so that's nice

138.36 --> 146.239
it did rain earlier too

142.02 --> 146.239
like around one o'clock

146.459 --> 149.239
anyway

150.18 --> 154.56
right

152.04 --> 157.5
hello slow-mo moon buggy first in chat

154.56 --> 159.9
good to see you

157.5 --> 165.0
it is Saturday

159.9 --> 165.0
the 31st of July 2021

165.42 --> 168.67999999999998
day of July

168.9 --> 173.87900000000002
ah

170.94 --> 177.319
um August is almost here

173.879 --> 177.319
how the time has flown

179.7 --> 189.17999999999998
all right so yeah we'll be having an

183.84 --> 193.22
in an hour show maybe longer we'll see

189.18 --> 193.22
depending on what's gonna roll out today

201.12 --> 205.739
right

203.34 --> 208.26
so yesterday's show

205.739 --> 210.959
it's pretty decent

208.26 --> 212.819
I didn't watch it back though like

210.959 --> 215.519
sometimes I feel like watching it back

212.819 --> 217.79899999999998
sometimes I I don't feel watching it

215.519 --> 221.54
like watching a bet

217.799 --> 221.54000000000002
I don't know uh

224.34 --> 231.239
yeah the theme also kind of continues

229.14 --> 234.79899999999998
had a lot of trouble figuring it out

231.239 --> 234.799
this morning so I asked Adam

235.2 --> 240.0
could you scrape something together I

237.239 --> 243.019
could I just couldn't figure it out

240.0 --> 243.019
said just

243.18 --> 248.34
he managed to put it together and yeah

246.06 --> 252.12
why not

248.34 --> 255.019
so the petals continue their Journey

252.12 --> 255.019
down the stream

256.32 --> 262.32
and eventually yeah they will end up for

258.959 --> 264.419
the fishes they will sink to the bottom

262.32 --> 266.04
whether it's like at the bottom of the

264.419 --> 269.28
river or

266.04 --> 271.699
at the ocean where it'll end up

269.28 --> 271.69899999999996
right

274.32 --> 277.15999999999997
anyway

277.32 --> 283.199
yes there's Flat Earth debate was pretty

279.3 --> 287.1
good another long after show

283.199 --> 290.78000000000003
this time akumu virus Got Back

287.1 --> 290.78000000000003
being his usual self

292.139 --> 297.74
so a lot of coriolis issues

295.199 --> 297.74
again

298.02 --> 302.69899999999996
good show overall then Nathan is really

300.06 --> 306.0
informed so

302.699 --> 308.28000000000003
can't wait to see that back on Sunday

306.0 --> 310.199
this evening of course there will be

308.28 --> 311.21999999999997
live ball busters and I'll be part of

310.199 --> 314.539
that

311.22 --> 314.53900000000004
looking forward to it

314.759 --> 317.36
right

320.46 --> 323.06
let's see

338.34 --> 341.539
what was I doing yesterday

359.34 --> 363.85999999999996
I'll figure it out

361.139 --> 363.86
anyway

379.38 --> 381.979
hmm

402.3 --> 408.90000000000003
right so yeah anyway the whole news

406.44 --> 412.02
thing with the Corona and all that is

408.9 --> 413.63899999999995
continuing and it's really standing out

412.02 --> 416.039
now that

413.639 --> 418.40000000000003
pretty much everyone where in the world

416.039 --> 421.199
the

418.4 --> 424.79999999999995
vaccination supposedly

421.199 --> 428.539
alleged vaccination vaccination is

424.8 --> 428.539
getting identified for what it is

429.36 --> 434.599
and people are really sick of it

432.12 --> 434.599
like

434.639 --> 439.86
some yeah some people will just really

437.52 --> 441.35999999999996
get carried away and

439.86 --> 444.3
and do it

441.36 --> 447.0
almost by accident at this point

444.3 --> 448.919
but the vast majority is like catching

447.0 --> 451.62
on to

448.919 --> 453.78
the propagandizing and the obvious lies

451.62 --> 455.52
and the fraud with Statistics so yeah

453.78 --> 457.919
even like

455.52 --> 460.919
on the Dutch alternative news it's

457.919 --> 463.62
literally filled just

460.919 --> 466.139
chock-full with articles

463.62 --> 469.139
of people

466.139 --> 473.90000000000003
going after this system going after

469.139 --> 473.90000000000003
these specific people in governments

474.78 --> 479.34
in my government in this case

477.419 --> 483.419
like that are just

479.34 --> 485.75899999999996
rolling out the corona propaganda

483.419 --> 487.919
and yeah this is

485.759 --> 491.099
it's been building for some time and

487.919 --> 494.15999999999997
it's getting really intense

491.099 --> 496.08
very curious like what the continuation

494.16 --> 497.34000000000003
will be of this if they're just gonna

496.08 --> 499.56
keep it

497.34 --> 500.94
on the same level or if there's actually

499.56 --> 503.58
some

500.94 --> 504.84
set of actions gonna come rolling out of

503.58 --> 507.12
this

504.84 --> 509.34
we'll see

507.12 --> 511.68
but I get the feeling that the whole

509.34 --> 513.899
supposed crisis

511.68 --> 515.1800000000001
that led to all the lockdowns and the

513.899 --> 519.06
vaccinations

515.18 --> 520.62
it's it's now widely identified for what

519.06 --> 522.4789999999999
it is

520.62 --> 526.58
and that's good

522.479 --> 526.58
right so yeah I can report on that

527.7 --> 532.44
right it's really it's getting more

529.86 --> 534.9590000000001
difficult to even get specific because

532.44 --> 537.48
it's just there's so many loads of

534.959 --> 540.18
Articles and reports and people that

537.48 --> 543.66
come out like oh I took it

540.18 --> 545.64
got bad reaction or this this other

543.66 --> 547.62
person took it and

545.64 --> 552.5
yeah

547.62 --> 552.5
oh Jesus really slow mo muggy

561.6 --> 564.5600000000001
holy [Â __Â ]

572.399 --> 575.06
all right

581.04 --> 586.2199999999999
told her not to a thousand times and she

583.62 --> 586.22
still did it

590.16 --> 594.98
yeah that's

591.66 --> 594.98
that's very painful

595.8 --> 602.0999999999999
I bet a whole bunch of people like us

599.04 --> 605.12
experience this constantly like I'm now

602.1 --> 605.12
at the point where

606.24 --> 611.5790000000001
I'm technically not even asking anymore

609.72 --> 614.519
just

611.579 --> 617.3389999999999
because I almost expect like everybody

614.519 --> 619.32
that I had some level of respect for

617.339 --> 621.6
throughout my life if I asked them

619.32 --> 623.519
they'll turn out to have been stupid

621.6 --> 625.94
enough to take it

623.519 --> 625.94
right

627.0 --> 631.88
I I just I don't even really want to ask

629.519 --> 631.88
anymore

632.82 --> 640.62
I'm not afraid of getting infected by it

636.779 --> 642.12
so I shouldn't need to ask just for my

640.62 --> 644.7
own safety

642.12 --> 646.98
although yeah if I wanna

644.7 --> 649.62
date a girl

646.98 --> 651.12
then I definitely have to ask because I

649.62 --> 655.4590000000001
don't

651.12 --> 655.4590000000001
want to date a girl that has a fax right

657.36 --> 664.519
for her job of course

661.019 --> 664.519
of course of course

679.92 --> 682.6999999999999
ah

684.36 --> 691.019
right look if they had taken it whoever

688.079 --> 695.0999999999999
it is whoever it is if they'd taken it

691.019 --> 697.019
most of the times it would have been for

695.1 --> 698.519
what seemed to them like a good reason

697.019 --> 700.44
to do it

698.519 --> 703.019
right because what is more important

700.44 --> 705.0600000000001
than your job that one job you're so

703.019 --> 707.22
specialized in and you're so used to it

705.06 --> 711.5999999999999
and you're so good at it and you gotta

707.22 --> 714.839
all the on the in the field knowledge

711.6 --> 717.6
and you know everybody that's coming and

714.839 --> 720.4200000000001
going on the work floor like yeah a lot

717.6 --> 723.72
of people that get into a job

720.42 --> 728.42
into a career job they can't even

723.72 --> 728.4200000000001
imagine that this is really happening

729.36 --> 735.62
that they could be broken out of their

731.899 --> 735.62
optimal functioning

738.24 --> 744.42
that they would have to break this off

740.88 --> 746.7
for the test most people literally can't

744.42 --> 750.3
imagine it

746.7 --> 752.7
they hold on to it so hard

750.3 --> 756.3
that they'll literally risk death for it

752.7 --> 757.74
and some will actually die

756.3 --> 760.3389999999999
doing it

757.74 --> 760.339
it's

771.98 --> 777.86
all right but yeah sorry to hear about

774.54 --> 777.86
that slo-mo moon buggy

784.5 --> 789.0
but yeah what I just talked about that's

786.839 --> 792.3000000000001
not something I just came up with

789.0 --> 794.88
because I think a lot about

792.3 --> 795.899
everybody that's been important to me in

794.88 --> 799.92
my life

795.899 --> 802.7
especially like girlfriends

799.92 --> 802.6999999999999
in the past

804.24 --> 809.22
and yeah I always hold

807.18 --> 811.1999999999999
the loving memories is one of the things

809.22 --> 814.5
that I do it's like

811.2 --> 816.899
once I get engaged in a relationship

814.5 --> 819.48
like that's forever right whatever

816.899 --> 822.24
physically happens

819.48 --> 824.94
the connection

822.24 --> 826.74
level of opening up like that stays with

824.94 --> 830.0400000000001
memory forever

826.74 --> 831.6
but as I'm thinking all back and by the

830.04 --> 834.3199999999999
way that includes for really tight

831.6 --> 834.32
friendships

834.72 --> 840.6
realizing that so many people in the

837.42 --> 842.76
past are very likely to have been swept

840.6 --> 845.9590000000001
away by this

842.76 --> 845.959
and getting caught

847.38 --> 851.54
and I realize also is that

854.04 --> 860.639
in those times I would not have warned

858.0 --> 862.5
them enough for something like this to

860.639 --> 863.82
come

862.5 --> 867.18
right

863.82 --> 869.4590000000001
so I even realizing that start to punish

867.18 --> 871.62
myself a little for not catching on

869.459 --> 875.3389999999999
quicker in order to

871.62 --> 878.519
adapt just the communications I had at

875.339 --> 880.98
the time to being prepared for this

878.519 --> 883.98
now with some

880.98 --> 886.5790000000001
I did I just didn't have a lot of grip

883.98 --> 890.1
on it I was like more like conspiracy

886.579 --> 893.519
like oh be careful be careful

890.1 --> 895.5
which at the time was just seeing as ah

893.519 --> 898.399
you're just like paranoid you're you're

895.5 --> 898.399
overly careful

901.56 --> 906.3199999999999
right I was a conspiracy theorist like

904.139 --> 906.32
that

907.56 --> 912.3
but not one that literally gets super

910.32 --> 913.9200000000001
paranoid over little detailed things

912.3 --> 916.199
although

913.92 --> 919.62
articles that came out with like over

916.199 --> 921.8389999999999
yeah dramatic suggestions that are that

919.62 --> 924.0600000000001
I now would identify as obviously not

921.839 --> 926.339
true

924.06 --> 929.3389999999999
and sometimes I would bump into those

926.339 --> 932.1
and get carried away but I would try to

929.339 --> 935.339
catch on quickly and at least not start

932.1 --> 938.24
out burdening everybody with that newly

935.339 --> 940.9200000000001
found

938.24 --> 942.839
discovery that is so impactful

940.92 --> 945.74
potentially right I wouldn't bother

942.839 --> 945.74
everybody with it

946.68 --> 951.18
huh

948.839 --> 954.8000000000001
what the

951.18 --> 954.8
hello Terror 306

957.899 --> 960.74
raw mage

964.8 --> 967.399
all right

983.22 --> 987.5400000000001
all right

984.36 --> 990.24
but yeah thinking about all that about

987.54 --> 993.06
people in my past how I

990.24 --> 994.8
now feel like I had not all prepared

993.06 --> 997.04
them well enough for what was going to

994.8 --> 997.04
come

998.94 --> 1005.24
because at the time I was still in the

1002.36 --> 1007.279
middle of being tested right in the face

1005.24 --> 1011.0790000000001
of society I knew there were things

1007.279 --> 1011.079
wrong but I didn't know how much

1016.839 --> 1022.0
and now thinking about it like

1022.339 --> 1028.24
if I had peaked earlier if I'd really

1025.939 --> 1028.24
like

1028.88 --> 1032.419
if I had done something similar to what

1031.1 --> 1034.579
I did

1032.419 --> 1036.3190000000002
with the Flat Earth Awakening breaking

1034.579 --> 1038.48
on YouTube

1036.319 --> 1041.0
if I done had done something like that

1038.48 --> 1043.28
like five years before and really

1041.0 --> 1047.059
started to ship step out of the Shadows

1043.28 --> 1050.24
which was at the time very scary for me

1047.059 --> 1052.52
because I had been partially fear poor

1050.24 --> 1054.08
and indoctrinated like as soon as you do

1052.52 --> 1056.539
that you

1054.08 --> 1060.1399999999999
you get assassinated or something right

1056.539 --> 1061.82
very dramatic no also partially thanks

1060.14 --> 1063.6200000000001
to Alex Jones but

1061.82 --> 1065.78
I think that a lot of the times he

1063.62 --> 1069.86
actually genuinely thinks that but that

1065.78 --> 1072.1399999999999
kind of rubbed off on me I was very much

1069.86 --> 1073.1
trying to stay in the shadows as much as

1072.14 --> 1075.0800000000002
possible

1073.1 --> 1078.58
and I wonder sometimes if I had broken

1075.08 --> 1078.58
out much quicker

1079.1 --> 1084.1399999999999
I wouldn't have probably not have ended

1081.14 --> 1088.76
up in the situation I am now

1084.14 --> 1093.14
the fine balance and skills that I have

1088.76 --> 1093.98
but would I have been able to warn more

1093.14 --> 1097.16
people

1093.98 --> 1100.1
about the facts and not taking it

1097.16 --> 1104.0
because there were others

1100.1 --> 1106.539
like even even in around 2010 went to

1104.0 --> 1106.539
meetings

1107.48 --> 1113.059
that were like trying to warn people

1109.7 --> 1115.039
about vaccines and geoengineering and

1113.059 --> 1117.5
chemtrails

1115.039 --> 1120.2
and other things

1117.5 --> 1123.14
right not flat Earth of course oh don't

1120.2 --> 1125.2
don't start about that

1123.14 --> 1129.0800000000002
but

1125.2 --> 1132.76
the anti-vectors at the time they were

1129.08 --> 1132.76
getting really punished

1132.919 --> 1137.8600000000001
and everybody would ignore that

1138.98 --> 1145.46
like there were they were regarded and

1142.76 --> 1148.059
discriminated against

1145.46 --> 1151.52
as like like

1148.059 --> 1154.7
Anarchist Fanatics like

1151.52 --> 1156.62
in that was really how it was dealt with

1154.7 --> 1158.78
at the time you were seen in some kind

1156.62 --> 1161.6
of a weird religious fanatic for not

1158.78 --> 1166.12
being a vaxxer or being very anti-factor

1161.6 --> 1166.12
like that and just people would ignore

1166.52 --> 1172.6
all the issues that have been building

1168.82 --> 1172.6
for such a long time

1177.5 --> 1184.24
so I think that even if I had stepped up

1180.98 --> 1184.24
to the plate earlier

1185.9 --> 1190.16
wouldn't

1187.28 --> 1194.32
have been able to alter the destiny of

1190.16 --> 1194.3200000000002
these people that I now think back to

1196.46 --> 1200.0
right

1197.72 --> 1203.5
so yeah when I think about it very

1200.0 --> 1203.5
carefully very widely

1203.9 --> 1208.88
let go of things I come to the

1206.659 --> 1211.94
conclusion that I could not have

1208.88 --> 1215.0590000000002
prevented anyone

1211.94 --> 1216.74
from taking it if they have because I

1215.059 --> 1219.1399999999999
don't know if they have

1216.74 --> 1221.96
I would actually have to like find

1219.14 --> 1224.72
everybody call them up and ask them and

1221.96 --> 1227.44
I'm not ready to do that

1224.72 --> 1227.44
at all

1232.64 --> 1237.38
so yeah the question

1234.559 --> 1241.1789999999999
did you take the facts for me is a

1237.38 --> 1241.179
extremely loaded question

1245.12 --> 1251.62
also because if people that I actually

1248.299 --> 1251.62
like would have taken it

1252.5 --> 1257.36
they might not be able to even handle

1255.26 --> 1261.8799999999999
that it's a bad thing that they've taken

1257.36 --> 1261.8799999999999
it and they've been hurt

1262.34 --> 1268.22
or they will be hurt by it

1264.919 --> 1271.46
and they they never consciously deserved

1268.22 --> 1273.799
it it was only because of foolish Trust

1271.46 --> 1277.039
really

1273.799 --> 1281.24
and that's such a painful lesson

1277.039 --> 1285.82
and potentially lethal it's so painful

1281.24 --> 1285.82
and I almost feel

1288.14 --> 1294.26
like a personal Injustice to this

1291.86 --> 1298.8799999999999
I me

1294.26 --> 1300.679
I was extremely naive if this situation

1298.88 --> 1303.14
unrolling now

1300.679 --> 1305.419
would have to this level literally

1303.14 --> 1308.14
happened 20 years ago

1305.419 --> 1308.14
I would have gotten the

1310.76 --> 1316.52
in my foolishness

1313.34 --> 1320.48
I would have and the realization to that

1316.52 --> 1324.02
I almost have now already

1320.48 --> 1325.039
a weird remote sensation of survivor's

1324.02 --> 1327.5
guilt

1325.039 --> 1330.28
because I would have been fooled at some

1327.5 --> 1330.28
point in my life

1331.52 --> 1336.44
right I can't just say everybody that's

1334.34 --> 1338.1789999999999
now taking it oh they're all just

1336.44 --> 1340.4
numpties they're all

1338.179 --> 1343.46
they all deserve it

1340.4 --> 1346.52
really do they really deserve it

1343.46 --> 1348.559
or did they just fail in extremely

1346.52 --> 1352.28
difficult test

1348.559 --> 1355.28
and they don't really deserve it they

1352.28 --> 1357.7
just didn't make the cut

1355.28 --> 1357.7
right

1358.52 --> 1364.1589999999999
the whole very

1360.08 --> 1368.36
heavy [Â __Â ] in a way and everybody's you

1364.159 --> 1372.7600000000002
like you walk in the middle of it right

1368.36 --> 1372.76
and most can't confront it really

1372.919 --> 1378.74
or not they might address it maybe joke

1376.22 --> 1380.659
away with it or say ah it won't be that

1378.74 --> 1382.22
bad or they'll find something it'll be

1380.659 --> 1386.0
okay

1382.22 --> 1387.919
but really it's all very heavy

1386.0 --> 1391.1
and very painful

1387.919 --> 1394.5200000000002
of basically what

1391.1 --> 1397.039
has been allowed to unroll the only the

1394.52 --> 1398.24
evil that has been allowed to unleash

1397.039 --> 1401.419
like this

1398.24 --> 1404.419
because it is evil it is straight up

1401.419 --> 1404.419
lying

1404.5 --> 1409.94
with deadly consequences

1407.6 --> 1413.4189999999999
and the people at the top

1409.94 --> 1416.48
that roll this out they know it

1413.419 --> 1419.3600000000001
they embrace it and that makes it

1416.48 --> 1422.3600000000001
very much a crime

1419.36 --> 1424.9599999999998
a spiritual crime for starters it's a

1422.36 --> 1424.9599999999998
dark Act

1427.76 --> 1432.98
right and then of course there's the

1430.58 --> 1435.32
Nuremberg code and other things that

1432.98 --> 1437.72
will actually have to provide for the

1435.32 --> 1441.6789999999999
roots

1437.72 --> 1444.44
of physical Justice right

1441.679 --> 1448.0
but this real crime is the spiritual

1444.44 --> 1448.0
crime that they commit

1448.279 --> 1452.0
that's the one that really stands out

1450.14 --> 1454.6000000000001
that's the one that actually does the

1452.0 --> 1454.6
most damage

1465.2 --> 1468.4
[Music]

1468.5 --> 1474.58
so anyway

1471.26 --> 1474.58
a little speech

1474.64 --> 1479.6000000000001
confronting people

1477.26 --> 1480.74
did you take the facts do you know what

1479.6 --> 1483.559
you've done

1480.74 --> 1486.02
if you did

1483.559 --> 1489.5
do you realize like if even if they

1486.02 --> 1491.36
didn't like do you even realize like

1489.5 --> 1493.96
how devastating

1491.36 --> 1493.9599999999998
is

1494.179 --> 1500.2
what's happening out there how many

1496.039 --> 1500.2
people do you know take in the facts

1502.76 --> 1507.74
and did you know

1504.919 --> 1512.0590000000002
that before all this [Â __Â ] happened

1507.74 --> 1513.74
starting in 2020 did you know that even

1512.059 --> 1517.3999999999999
decades before

1513.74 --> 1519.98
all these other medical emergencies has

1517.4 --> 1521.779
got a lot of attention on television do

1519.98 --> 1524.6
you know that

1521.779 --> 1527.0
it's basically the same people using the

1524.6 --> 1529.58
same systems the same mechanisms and the

1527.0 --> 1532.279
flu shots of all the types swine flu

1529.58 --> 1534.559
birds all these shots

1532.279 --> 1536.62
were also

1534.559 --> 1538.8799999999999
Eugenics based

1536.62 --> 1540.799
degeneration tools like it didn't

1538.88 --> 1543.74
actually do anything

1540.799 --> 1545.779
even back then people that took it would

1543.74 --> 1548.679
always be the ones getting diseases

1545.779 --> 1548.679
every time

1551.659 --> 1556.46
so this is not the first time by a long

1554.6 --> 1558.62
shot and this is not like even the first

1556.46 --> 1560.24
time in a century or whatever right

1558.62 --> 1563.299
because it definitely has happened

1560.24 --> 1566.779
before to this scale

1563.299 --> 1568.82
or near to this scale

1566.779 --> 1571.64
but it's constantly happening it's only

1568.82 --> 1574.1
now that it's been turned into this

1571.64 --> 1576.38
worldwide

1574.1 --> 1582.34
lock step

1576.38 --> 1582.3400000000001
dance and media narrative a myth

1583.58 --> 1589.46
to this scale that's supposedly plaguing

1586.7 --> 1592.52
the Earth any other situations in the

1589.46 --> 1595.039
medical system and all the other flus

1592.52 --> 1597.08
yeah I was like oh it's so dangerous oh

1595.039 --> 1601.22
my God so danger we have to do this

1597.08 --> 1603.74
quickly quickly but it would always kind

1601.22 --> 1607.52
of end back under control be forgotten

1603.74 --> 1610.279
and then just like okay move on

1607.52 --> 1611.779
oh this time they're not letting go of

1610.279 --> 1614.12
it

1611.779 --> 1618.679
right they're they're taking it to its

1614.12 --> 1621.4399999999998
final conclusion which they think is

1618.679 --> 1623.74
endless red tape endless bureaucracy

1621.44 --> 1626.6000000000001
endless new variants endless new

1623.74 --> 1630.26
nonsense story to continue the nonsense

1626.6 --> 1633.5
story so they never have to end

1630.26 --> 1638.419
the accompanying rules and code of

1633.5 --> 1638.419
conduct in the emergency situation

1639.14 --> 1643.46
can they actually do that

1641.659 --> 1647.72
because yeah

1643.46 --> 1650.059
a vast amount of public worldwide right

1647.72 --> 1652.76
not even like based on singular groups

1650.059 --> 1655.46
but worldwide decentralized

1652.76 --> 1658.7
a whole bunch of people are figuring out

1655.46 --> 1662.0
out figuring it out big time

1658.7 --> 1664.22
or what happens then what happens when a

1662.0 --> 1666.38
whole bunch of people a person a

1664.22 --> 1668.96
clear-cut percentage starts to

1666.38 --> 1671.48
completely figure out the dance

1668.96 --> 1676.52
what happens to the dance can they then

1671.48 --> 1676.52
continue spinning red tape forever

1676.58 --> 1681.46
I think

1677.84 --> 1681.4599999999998
they're I think they can't

1682.279 --> 1687.22
I think that the dance will break itself

1687.98 --> 1691.46
with the red tape like

1690.26 --> 1693.679
like

1691.46 --> 1695.179
see it as a dancer and the dancer has

1693.679 --> 1696.919
this red tape and it's just spinning

1695.179 --> 1699.26
around with it and everybody just look

1696.919 --> 1700.88
oh look at how long the red tape is

1699.26 --> 1704.539
but then when a whole bunch of people

1700.88 --> 1707.419
realized like this is nonsense

1704.539 --> 1710.419
all the wrap tape is a distraction

1707.419 --> 1712.22
the dancer doesn't actually have all

1710.419 --> 1714.44
that greater moves it's just the red

1712.22 --> 1716.8990000000001
tape guns well then the dancer if they

1714.44 --> 1718.52
find out that they're being caught on or

1716.899 --> 1721.1589999999999
not being all that great a dancer

1718.52 --> 1722.48
they're gonna try to get more wild and

1721.159 --> 1723.8600000000001
more attention right well guess what

1722.48 --> 1725.84
they're going to end up choking

1723.86 --> 1729.08
themselves

1725.84 --> 1730.8799999999999
with the retay by accident

1729.08 --> 1733.399
right

1730.88 --> 1735.6200000000001
eventually it always tends to go to like

1733.399 --> 1737.4189999999999
attention graviness goes to victim

1735.62 --> 1739.82
Consciousness based well they will

1737.419 --> 1741.679
accidentally hang themselves with the

1739.82 --> 1744.2
red tape

1741.679 --> 1747.02
oh look at me I'm so poor and people

1744.2 --> 1749.8990000000001
didn't pay attention they didn't listen

1747.02 --> 1752.74
oh look at me I'm hung up strung up by

1749.899 --> 1752.7399999999998
this red tape

1755.179 --> 1760.8200000000002
right and it's all a giant entangled

1757.7 --> 1763.039
mess well guess what a dancer is all

1760.82 --> 1765.1399999999999
stuck up in red tape all tied together

1763.039 --> 1767.179
they're not dancing anymore they're just

1765.14 --> 1769.72
stuck now

1767.179 --> 1769.72
right

1784.76 --> 1790.22
yeah we're supposed to be the conspiracy

1787.039 --> 1793.34
theorists how the roles reverse

1790.22 --> 1796.34
they lost the IQ test or or rather

1793.34 --> 1799.1589999999999
it's not as much IQ test it's

1796.34 --> 1801.32
critical thinking ability right is there

1799.159 --> 1805.1000000000001
tests is there like official

1801.32 --> 1807.1399999999999
standardized tests for critical thinking

1805.1 --> 1811.34
I don't know any

1807.14 --> 1813.5
they're not like part of the IQ EQ tests

1811.34 --> 1815.0
right and those tests are not about

1813.5 --> 1816.98
critical thinking they're about

1815.0 --> 1819.74
quickness

1816.98 --> 1822.98
and having it with the ieq especially

1819.74 --> 1825.74
having a feel and standardized social

1822.98 --> 1828.14
responses etc etc and like what position

1825.74 --> 1829.34
do you take in the Spectrum

1828.14 --> 1833.2990000000002
right

1829.34 --> 1836.36
that's not necessarily critical thinking

1833.299 --> 1838.6399999999999
critical thinking is the ability to it

1836.36 --> 1840.6789999999999
on the spot figure out when something is

1838.64 --> 1842.96
[Â __Â ]

1840.679 --> 1846.14
right it's really all about figuring out

1842.96 --> 1848.539
lies from truth that's the real Core

1846.14 --> 1850.8200000000002
Power of critical thinking

1848.539 --> 1851.72
there's not really standardized tests

1850.82 --> 1853.52
for this

1851.72 --> 1857.26
also because it's fairly really

1853.52 --> 1857.26
difficult to make those because

1857.779 --> 1864.26
the knowledge available really

1860.059 --> 1867.019
determines how critical thinking roots

1864.26 --> 1871.299
what happened like what a person

1867.019 --> 1874.76
believes determines on what they will

1871.299 --> 1876.74
choose to approach critically thinking

1874.76 --> 1879.26
if they can right because if it's

1876.74 --> 1881.299
something that is close to them or to

1879.26 --> 1883.8799999999999
something they really associate with

1881.299 --> 1886.039
then they might avoid doing that like

1883.88 --> 1888.2600000000002
you would protect a friend right you

1886.039 --> 1890.0
know they're doing something bad but

1888.26 --> 1892.8799999999999
yeah you'll try to make them stop but

1890.0 --> 1896.96
not shame them for it not make them

1892.88 --> 1899.5390000000002
look really bad in public right

1896.96 --> 1902.799
so critical thinking is really really

1899.539 --> 1902.799
difficult to standardize

1903.919 --> 1909.26
maybe that's why they don't exist in an

1906.5 --> 1911.48
official capacity because IQ test

1909.26 --> 1914.24
doesn't test critical thinking it's

1911.48 --> 1916.8990000000001
really quickness and sharpness that's

1914.24 --> 1916.8990000000001
not the same

1925.58 --> 1930.799
yeah quickness sharpness and

1928.279 --> 1934.059
concentration ability especially that

1930.799 --> 1934.059
concentration ability

1950.179 --> 1954.8600000000001
that's not true I'll really present the

1952.88 --> 1958.8400000000001
evidence then Mark back

1954.86 --> 1958.84
virus is just another globe

1959.779 --> 1963.1
it's only a model

1964.519 --> 1970.159
the amount of mistakes that any critical

1967.519 --> 1972.76
thinking person can find in every model

1970.159 --> 1975.8600000000001
and the root sources that that

1972.76 --> 1977.779
established them as Something official

1975.86 --> 1980.899
every time somebody looks on that

1977.779 --> 1982.82
there's so many ways to figure out how

1980.899 --> 1985.2199999999998
it's wrong

1982.82 --> 1986.72
when it comes to bacteria bacterial

1985.22 --> 1990.019
theories even

1986.72 --> 1992.779
but especially virus Theory like every

1990.019 --> 1996.1
part of it is wrong

1992.779 --> 1996.1
none of it happens

1997.1 --> 2002.6399999999999
every time it suggested it's primary

1999.38 --> 2002.64
it's always secondary

2002.799 --> 2006.1589999999999
right

2004.0 --> 2007.419
every time there is a suggestion that

2006.159 --> 2011.8600000000001
there is this

2007.419 --> 2016.019
separated empty entity like aspect of it

2011.86 --> 2016.019
it turns out no it isn't

2016.919 --> 2022.8990000000001
it's actually part of normal biology

2019.659 --> 2024.88
right there's even ideas around I don't

2022.899 --> 2027.58
know if they're true

2024.88 --> 2030.88
but it goes as far as that

2027.58 --> 2034.059
maybe the original establishment of what

2030.88 --> 2036.5800000000002
a virus is as a micro thing under a

2034.059 --> 2038.62
microscope that it's not even an

2036.58 --> 2041.3799999999999
organism that it might go as far as to

2038.62 --> 2043.84
be just debris

2041.38 --> 2046.0
debris just before it gets dissolved

2043.84 --> 2048.96
right it does come out of a breaking

2046.0 --> 2052.06
cell right so is that an entity

2048.96 --> 2055.7200000000003
parasiting and then forming itself or is

2052.06 --> 2058.179
it just the bleeding out of the cell and

2055.72 --> 2061.24
it's not really even

2058.179 --> 2063.2200000000003
not even at all as I've suggested like

2061.24 --> 2066.339
oh it's exosomes it's something that

2063.22 --> 2069.5789999999997
cleans it up is it that or is the

2066.339 --> 2074.139
original evidence on which the virus

2069.579 --> 2077.02
thing was established not even that

2074.139 --> 2080.44
it's just the bleeding out and how it

2077.02 --> 2082.96
looks that it has nothing whatsoever to

2080.44 --> 2085.78
do even with some kind of a

2082.96 --> 2090.04
mechanism anymore it's just the bleeding

2085.78 --> 2093.7000000000003
out right it there's been people saying

2090.04 --> 2095.379
virus situations or go that far and I

2093.7 --> 2099.18
don't know whether that's correct or not

2095.379 --> 2099.18
but they have a point

2099.64 --> 2104.7599999999998
because

2101.32 --> 2104.76
based on the data

2105.04 --> 2108.2799999999997
well they have a point they might just

2106.48 --> 2110.98
be right

2108.28 --> 2113.079
can't guarantee that it is correct like

2110.98 --> 2115.42
that whether it is like access homes

2113.079 --> 2117.96
doing their like a separate inner body

2115.42 --> 2117.96
function

2118.3 --> 2124.32
or whether it's just debris that gets

2120.82 --> 2124.32
cleaned up by other things

2126.339 --> 2133.96
right viruses are totally debunked

2129.7 --> 2136.96
totally debunked like Globe level

2133.96 --> 2136.96
debunked

2141.0 --> 2149.32
viruses are like the globe spinning

2144.04 --> 2153.2799999999997
globe Earth of the microbiology cosm

2149.32 --> 2156.54
the microcosm it kind of is this will

2153.28 --> 2156.5400000000004
become that it's a sphere

2157.48 --> 2164.7400000000002
it's extremely alleged in what it even

2160.96 --> 2167.619
looks like what it does what it can do

2164.74 --> 2169.54
the cosmology of the entire world around

2167.619 --> 2172.1800000000003
it right because that's all part of the

2169.54 --> 2175.359
narratives like oh viruses they spread

2172.18 --> 2178.7799999999997
around they go over the world this

2175.359 --> 2182.14
supremely supposed micro particle they

2178.78 --> 2185.44
travel over the world right a giant

2182.14 --> 2188.0789999999997
Cosmos is Imagine for the super micro

2185.44 --> 2189.46
particles just like the spinning ball

2188.079 --> 2193.42
Earth

2189.46 --> 2195.82
there's a giant micro Cosmos that is

2193.42 --> 2199.079
imagined where this supposed spinning

2195.82 --> 2201.76
volleyball that we all live on

2199.079 --> 2204.0
exists and then travels through it's the

2201.76 --> 2204.0
same

2204.16 --> 2209.8199999999997
architecture

2206.68 --> 2209.8199999999997
in many ways

2210.46 --> 2217.42
right if you say it's Kabbalah it's

2213.76 --> 2219.82
routed and then I would I would know

2217.42 --> 2222.2200000000003
but I wouldn't be surprised

2219.82 --> 2224.1400000000003
that you know when similarities grow

2222.22 --> 2227.6189999999997
that strong

2224.14 --> 2228.96
usually they have the same roots

2227.619 --> 2231.52
because

2228.96 --> 2234.599
designers follow the same patterns for

2231.52 --> 2234.599
the same purposes

2236.68 --> 2243.0989999999997
it's all about functionality what it

2238.599 --> 2243.099
does to the mind and the spirit right

2259.079 --> 2265.3590000000004
yeah Tony Whitcomb

2262.359 --> 2265.359
buster

2265.9 --> 2269.98
well the thing is that from what I've

2268.42 --> 2272.98
gathered

2269.98 --> 2275.98
and I've addressed this earlier

2272.98 --> 2277.48
they didn't actually isolate even

2275.98 --> 2281.5
bacteria

2277.48 --> 2282.579
properly they would never like they'd

2281.5 --> 2284.44
definitely show that there's

2282.579 --> 2288.7000000000003
correlations

2284.44 --> 2292.2400000000002
but I've never heard like every time

2288.7 --> 2295.5989999999997
it was supposedly gonna infect somebody

2292.24 --> 2297.3999999999996
with disease correlating with the with

2295.599 --> 2300.88
the germs right

2297.4 --> 2303.04
they would always inject other crap they

2300.88 --> 2306.4
would never perfectly isolate the

2303.04 --> 2310.06
bacteria and you can do that

2306.4 --> 2314.26
in a bio Laboratory

2310.06 --> 2316.48
you separate it until like only only the

2314.26 --> 2319.9
little squirmy bacteria things are left

2316.48 --> 2323.98
no food for them every other cell debris

2319.9 --> 2326.92
everything gone just the bacteria well

2323.98 --> 2330.4
that that is never done even in vaccine

2326.92 --> 2334.2000000000003
technology they always end up

2330.4 --> 2337.0
putting all their crap into it

2334.2 --> 2339.2799999999997
poisoned oh it has a function oh it's

2337.0 --> 2340.78
supposed to weaken the bacteria so your

2339.28 --> 2343.48
system can handle it

2340.78 --> 2345.1600000000003
or the bacteria actually don't do

2343.48 --> 2349.06
anything

2345.16 --> 2351.339
and it's the poison that does the damage

2349.06 --> 2355.359
and then

2351.339 --> 2358.42
as a secondary effect to damage bacteria

2355.359 --> 2360.46
come around in the body and maybe even

2358.42 --> 2362.2000000000003
partially of what was injected with the

2360.46 --> 2363.04
vaccine if there even is bacteria in

2362.2 --> 2365.5
there

2363.04 --> 2367.42
but yeah the bunny will body will start

2365.5 --> 2371.26
to generate the bacteria to clean it up

2367.42 --> 2374.26
right so it has always been in my

2371.26 --> 2377.7400000000002
current opinion a trick the entire thing

2374.26 --> 2380.98
is a giant necromantic

2377.74 --> 2384.9599999999996
yeah trick

2380.98 --> 2384.96
like it was a lie

2385.54 --> 2392.14
the whole thing the whole industry of

2388.3 --> 2394.9
vaccines in its own right is a lie

2392.14 --> 2396.8199999999997
now does it mean that there aren't like

2394.9 --> 2400.06
even

2396.82 --> 2402.04
in a sort of unexpected experimental

2400.06 --> 2405.4
side effect positive things coming out

2402.04 --> 2407.88
of it and hey the placebo effect a

2405.4 --> 2410.6800000000003
person really believing in something

2407.88 --> 2412.7200000000003
actually does more good than people can

2410.68 --> 2415.4199999999996
even imagine

2412.72 --> 2418.72
so yeah it's I think it's pretty

2415.42 --> 2422.14
historical on average

2418.72 --> 2424.06
that despite poisonous influence if

2422.14 --> 2427.5989999999997
People's morale are strong if their

2424.06 --> 2430.0
spirit is strong then they can go

2427.599 --> 2432.339
through a lot of poisoning influences

2430.0 --> 2434.68
and not break down under it

2432.339 --> 2436.9
right so even with all the freaking

2434.68 --> 2438.94
vaccines the West

2436.9 --> 2442.119
and other societies that have been

2438.94 --> 2445.54
taking them even with all that poisoning

2442.119 --> 2447.6400000000003
influences we could and we were thriving

2445.54 --> 2450.52
up to some point

2447.64 --> 2452.56
but it probably capped it because that's

2450.52 --> 2454.3
what poison does it caps it takes away

2452.56 --> 2457.0
Peak

2454.3 --> 2460.5600000000004
performance and Peak Skill that's what

2457.0 --> 2460.56
typically the poison does

2464.44 --> 2470.28
all right so yeah

2467.079 --> 2473.2000000000003
I'm pretty much a anti-vector

2470.28 --> 2476.8
fundamentalist at this point

2473.2 --> 2479.5
but I'm still also trying to figure it

2476.8 --> 2481.54
out development always keeps going there

2479.5 --> 2484.24
may like it's so complicated I already

2481.54 --> 2487.18
explained like placebo effect it's

2484.24 --> 2489.5789999999997
miraculous what it actually does there

2487.18 --> 2491.2
is much more to explore

2489.579 --> 2493.5
in the face

2491.2 --> 2497.5
of discovering

2493.5 --> 2497.5
the necromancic

2498.76 --> 2503.0200000000004
medical system

2500.74 --> 2505.9799999999996
and it's vaccine

2503.02 --> 2505.98
situations

2506.319 --> 2513.04
there's a lot to discover in the face of

2509.26 --> 2515.5
that about health about how it all

2513.04 --> 2518.04
actually works because they've given us

2515.5 --> 2518.04
lies

2521.92 --> 2527.14
right and I'm talking about microbiology

2525.04 --> 2529.06
situation I'm not talking about like

2527.14 --> 2533.2
surgeons

2529.06 --> 2535.42
that just know how like a practically

2533.2 --> 2537.339
how the metabolism works and stabilize

2535.42 --> 2540.88
how you quickly

2537.339 --> 2542.56
fix an organ or something that is really

2540.88 --> 2544.1800000000003
impressive right I'm not talking about

2542.56 --> 2547.06
that at all

2544.18 --> 2550.96
like those people have unique skills

2547.06 --> 2554.7999999999997
yeah it's technically necromancy but

2550.96 --> 2557.92
they can do really great and miraculous

2554.8 --> 2561.579
things up to a certain point

2557.92 --> 2563.26
talking about vaccine

2561.579 --> 2566.619
technology

2563.26 --> 2568.8390000000004
and the standardization of it that

2566.619 --> 2570.46
specific part of the medical system is

2568.839 --> 2573.04
it even a medical system it's almost

2570.46 --> 2576.2200000000003
kind of like a corporate system or it's

2573.04 --> 2579.04
big corporations that that handle this

2576.22 --> 2581.6189999999997
thing and they get the creepy

2579.04 --> 2584.5
exemptions

2581.619 --> 2586.599
from government so you can't sue them if

2584.5 --> 2589.96
yeah if vaccines

2586.599 --> 2592.78
give you a lot of damage Etc

2589.96 --> 2598.38
but it's it's kind of separated from

2592.78 --> 2598.38
like hospitals how they function and

2599.26 --> 2605.26
surgeons

2601.54 --> 2607.24
right so yeah don't don't take don't

2605.26 --> 2609.88
throw out the baby with the bath water

2607.24 --> 2612.3999999999996
right the baby has surgery skills you

2609.88 --> 2613.599
need the baby but that bath water it's

2612.4 --> 2615.88
just dirt

2613.599 --> 2617.92
the bath water has got to go but make

2615.88 --> 2620.38
sure you don't throw out the baby with

2617.92 --> 2622.48
it because the baby might grow up to

2620.38 --> 2625.02
become a great surgeon that can save

2622.48 --> 2628.98
many lives right

2625.02 --> 2628.98
think about that carefully

2637.64 --> 2640.73
[Music]

2646.74 --> 2651.3999999999996
meet mechanics okay

2658.0 --> 2663.339
well necromancy specifically if you look

2661.42 --> 2666.819
at the root of the word even

2663.339 --> 2671.98
it's about life and death right so that

2666.819 --> 2674.68
can be giving life and taking it

2671.98 --> 2677.579
right so necromancy can literally be

2674.68 --> 2677.5789999999997
killing something

2677.74 --> 2684.1189999999997
but it can definitely also mean just

2680.5 --> 2684.119
without the intervention

2684.22 --> 2688.56
the recipient dies right

2689.02 --> 2697.38
so it's it's double-edged sword

2692.5 --> 2697.38
the coin of necromancy has two sides

2711.359 --> 2716.56
Homeopathy could replace most no

2716.92 --> 2720.7000000000003
uh

2718.48 --> 2722.92
no

2720.7 --> 2727.6189999999997
no there is no

2722.92 --> 2727.619
singular system right

2727.72 --> 2731.98
like how has alternative medicine

2729.94 --> 2735.16
thrived

2731.98 --> 2737.5
through a lot of trial and error people

2735.16 --> 2739.74
dedicating a lot of time to something

2737.5 --> 2742.66
figuring it out and even like

2739.74 --> 2746.4599999999996
specializing in it and then having

2742.66 --> 2750.18
long-term results to compare everything

2746.46 --> 2753.52
there's no singular

2750.18 --> 2756.46
therapy or singular system that should

2753.52 --> 2760.3
take over no I'm not even saying that

2756.46 --> 2762.94
allopathic medicine should be abolished

2760.3 --> 2767.02
right it has its place again especially

2762.94 --> 2769.68
in extreme emergency accidents

2767.02 --> 2769.68
all that

2772.96 --> 2777.52
but

2774.7 --> 2780.5789999999997
yeah how do you solve this well first

2777.52 --> 2782.68
just recognition that vaccination is

2780.579 --> 2785.76
actually detrimental

2782.68 --> 2785.7599999999998
in reality

2786.099 --> 2790.3590000000004
it's detrimental to the health

2788.26 --> 2794.619
specifically right oh yeah it may

2790.359 --> 2798.0989999999997
provide very useful manipulations to a

2794.619 --> 2800.6800000000003
corporate body that is involved money

2798.099 --> 2803.7400000000002
making control

2800.68 --> 2806.64
but for the actual health

2803.74 --> 2806.64
it's no good

2806.74 --> 2812.56
right so let's start by removing that

2809.859 --> 2815.5
from the medical system universally

2812.56 --> 2818.46
and then let's see what what we could do

2815.5 --> 2818.46
with the rest of it

2829.78 --> 2834.78
can't fix stinky feet yeah you can

2832.48 --> 2834.78
actually

2835.839 --> 2839.099
you absolutely can

2843.64 --> 2849.7599999999998
right stinky feet is all bacteria it's

2846.339 --> 2851.92
all bodily output I wash my feet every

2849.76 --> 2855.5400000000004
day

2851.92 --> 2855.54
my feet don't stink

2859.42 --> 2866.4
but if I've skipped washing them even a

2862.48 --> 2866.4
day yeah they will stink

2869.819 --> 2876.64
anti-fungal spray okay well yeah

2873.94 --> 2879.04
okay you can get like athlete's foot and

2876.64 --> 2881.339
all that in public showers so you gotta

2879.04 --> 2881.339
yeah

2886.359 --> 2891.7599999999998
but most of the effects that make people

2890.5 --> 2896.079
stink

2891.76 --> 2898.599
is usually because of what they eat

2896.079 --> 2900.76
it's kind of the primary cause every

2898.599 --> 2904.119
single time

2900.76 --> 2906.579
you change the diet properly then you

2904.119 --> 2910.7400000000002
could get rid of a lot of it

2906.579 --> 2910.7400000000002
and you will just not stink anymore

2912.22 --> 2916.66
I think with most people anyway can't

2914.98 --> 2918.819
guarantee it for everybody there might

2916.66 --> 2920.02
simply be a certain type of men or women

2918.819 --> 2923.5589999999997
that

2920.02 --> 2925.3
just no matter how healthy it like it

2923.559 --> 2927.28
can't be fixed because it's like part of

2925.3 --> 2928.54
their biology or their genetics or

2927.28 --> 2930.88
something I don't know

2928.54 --> 2934.54
but I think in general

2930.88 --> 2937.7200000000003
yeah you can actually fix it through

2934.54 --> 2941.2799999999997
diet through your figuring out in your

2937.72 --> 2941.2799999999997
metabolism what is causing this

2943.78 --> 2949.059
right and oh by the way

2946.96 --> 2950.619
most of the

2949.059 --> 2953.8
public

2950.619 --> 2956.559
uh products that supposedly get away

2953.8 --> 2957.52
this thing like a lot of deodorants and

2956.559 --> 2961.0
all that

2957.52 --> 2965.2599999999998
they actually make it worse

2961.0 --> 2966.94
they mask it and they compound the cause

2965.26 --> 2970.059
effect

2966.94 --> 2971.98
the cause of the actual stink

2970.059 --> 2974.559
right

2971.98 --> 2977.5
they make it worse

2974.559 --> 2980.92
so oh you want to get rid of stinky

2977.5 --> 2983.74
armpits stop using deodorant yeah oh

2980.92 --> 2986.5
that sounds so weird right yeah well I

2983.74 --> 2989.52
haven't taken it in 20 years

2986.5 --> 2989.52
I don't stink

2989.859 --> 2992.88
I really don't

3000.26 --> 3006.98
hydrotherapy what

3002.4 --> 3006.98
that's after somebody said

3010.559 --> 3016.6400000000003
I was addressing classical Homeopathy

3013.02 --> 3016.64
are you now addressing what

3017.119 --> 3025.619
anyway good to see Chad going now

3021.78 --> 3027.5400000000004
oh damn my show is almost over

3025.619 --> 3031.339
huh

3027.54 --> 3031.339
I'll go at least another 10 minutes

3040.74 --> 3048.859
yes P Jake grishank I agree

3045.319 --> 3048.859
deodorant stinks

3049.079 --> 3054.1800000000003
an aggressive perfumes can stink

3051.599 --> 3057.48
terribly like I don't like perfumes at

3054.18 --> 3060.8999999999996
all I have it hypersensitive nose

3057.48 --> 3063.9
almost like a dog's nose in ways

3060.9 --> 3065.579
and like every time somebody like when I

3063.9 --> 3068.1600000000003
go out for groceries I'm on my bike

3065.579 --> 3070.559
somebody comes past me like with heavy

3068.16 --> 3073.6189999999997
Dio like I literally have to hold my

3070.559 --> 3075.5400000000004
breath even outside I have to hold my

3073.619 --> 3078.92
breath because it hurts

3075.54 --> 3078.92
right and that's sensitive

3080.819 --> 3086.7599999999998
I used to have a roommate like years

3083.099 --> 3088.319
back that actually worked at a perfumery

3086.76 --> 3090.9
God

3088.319 --> 3093.0
like that was that was disastrous for me

3090.9 --> 3094.98
because that woman would just keep

3093.0 --> 3098.78
spraying it everywhere it's terrible

3094.98 --> 3098.78
like I would have to flee the house

3100.92 --> 3107.579
right not saying that all all types of

3104.46 --> 3110.52
horror films are evil

3107.579 --> 3112.26
right you can have very natural oil

3110.52 --> 3113.819
based

3112.26 --> 3116.1600000000003
perfumes

3113.819 --> 3118.98
that are much more subtle and that don't

3116.16 --> 3121.319
arouse that painful effect with me it is

3118.98 --> 3123.059
really the

3121.319 --> 3127.52
the oil

3123.059 --> 3131.099
the yeah the chemical industry oil based

3127.52 --> 3136.28
perfumes that have that effect on me

3131.099 --> 3136.28
that are guaranteed to be toxic for you

3158.78 --> 3164.3390000000004
okay average bear return to normal maybe

3162.359 --> 3166.98
you just need to stop

3164.339 --> 3170.48
biting down on each other

3166.98 --> 3170.48
have an actual conversation

3177.78 --> 3181.7000000000003
oh yeah sea breeze

3183.3 --> 3188.819
like this slight smell of seaweed is

3186.9 --> 3190.26
really what that is

3188.819 --> 3194.339
and

3190.26 --> 3197.28
if you're lucky like literally salty air

3194.339 --> 3199.619
droplets like micro droplets from the

3197.28 --> 3201.5400000000004
foam and [Â __Â ] goes your oh yeah it's

3199.619 --> 3202.98
really nice it's been a while since I

3201.54 --> 3205.7
smelled ocean

3202.98 --> 3205.7
I love that

3206.819 --> 3212.18
okay don't at home dude

3218.4 --> 3222.78
look stop at your both or I'm gonna time

3221.22 --> 3225.48
you both at

3222.78 --> 3227.8390000000004
get some more productive conversation

3225.48 --> 3227.839
going

3247.26 --> 3252.78
if you have titanium

3250.68 --> 3254.04
what

3252.78 --> 3256.579
what are you talking about George

3254.04 --> 3256.579
Sanford

3258.48 --> 3263.599
you have titanium plates in your body or

3261.48 --> 3263.599
something

3268.2 --> 3273.859
ah all right average bear yeah that's

3270.72 --> 3273.859
two different things definitely

3274.26 --> 3281.46
now Homeopathy is all about diluting

3277.619 --> 3285.059
to like insane degrees and then

3281.46 --> 3287.76
what it effectively says is like if you

3285.059 --> 3289.8590000000004
want to combat something then micronize

3287.76 --> 3293.3390000000004
it to

3289.859 --> 3295.92
create an opposition response it's it's

3293.339 --> 3298.38
very unique there Homeopathy is

3295.92 --> 3301.02
interesting but I wouldn't like lean on

3298.38 --> 3303.1800000000003
it like to make it the foundation of a

3301.02 --> 3306.559
medical system no

3303.18 --> 3306.5589999999997
but it is interesting

3308.22 --> 3315.9599999999996
not my first go-to though

3311.76 --> 3318.8390000000004
I would rather choose just general herbs

3315.96 --> 3321.66
and minerals and vitamins like I'm more

3318.839 --> 3325.319
about supplementation than that

3321.66 --> 3327.839
but it is still interesting hydrotherapy

3325.319 --> 3330.299
is all about just hydrating yourself

3327.839 --> 3335.0
it's more like cleansing

3330.299 --> 3335.0
therapy I think if I'm not mistaken

3344.579 --> 3350.059
yes thanks Glasgow Homeopathy I I dude

3347.4 --> 3350.059
I've been

3350.9 --> 3357.059
almost medically educated I just know a

3354.359 --> 3359.339
lot about different things and my dad's

3357.059 --> 3361.8590000000004
been really deeply into it

3359.339 --> 3364.619
at a later age

3361.859 --> 3369.0589999999997
and my mother used to be very much into

3364.619 --> 3372.119
herbs and like herbal medicine like old

3369.059 --> 3375.42
witch Style

3372.119 --> 3378.42
really interesting though she she knew

3375.42 --> 3380.66
things that I I'm afraid that it's been

3378.42 --> 3380.66
lost

3381.9 --> 3386.1600000000003
but there's more women out there for

3383.76 --> 3388.2000000000003
some reason it's always freaking women

3386.16 --> 3389.7599999999998
I just can like point at any freaking

3388.2 --> 3393.359
plant and just say like you could do

3389.76 --> 3395.2200000000003
this and that with it it's it's amazing

3393.359 --> 3397.46
every time

3395.22 --> 3399.72
but

3397.46 --> 3402.38
learned a little about Homeopathy

3399.72 --> 3402.3799999999997
earlier on

3403.74 --> 3408.7799999999997
and even in our family when I was much

3406.619 --> 3410.52
younger we did just also apply

3408.78 --> 3414.3590000000004
homeopathy

3410.52 --> 3415.04
worked out just fine like it's

3414.359 --> 3418.0789999999997
it's

3415.04 --> 3421.02
we had this weird

3418.079 --> 3422.6400000000003
family philosophy about it almost with

3421.02 --> 3425.04
Homeopathy it's like okay well

3422.64 --> 3428.04
Homeopathy it's kind of weird we don't

3425.04 --> 3429.54
know 100 how well it works but if it

3428.04 --> 3431.2799999999997
doesn't work

3429.54 --> 3434.46
then at least it's not going to do

3431.28 --> 3437.099
damage in contrast to what we already

3434.46 --> 3438.98
kind of were figuring out

3437.099 --> 3442.7000000000003
big Pharma

3438.98 --> 3445.68
allopathic medicine which is very like

3442.7 --> 3448.14
disruptive on average unfortunately

3445.68 --> 3450.4199999999996
eventually my mother did completely

3448.14 --> 3453.1189999999997
succumb to that

3450.42 --> 3455.099
but it has more to do with her personal

3453.119 --> 3457.559
psychological

3455.099 --> 3460.079
struggles with the word world and her

3457.559 --> 3461.6400000000003
emotions like at some point basically my

3460.079 --> 3465.48
mother just went nuts and became

3461.64 --> 3467.04
Reckless started like oh antidepressant

3465.48 --> 3470.46
and then

3467.04 --> 3474.18
more other stuff and just became piles

3470.46 --> 3477.02
and piles of pharmaceutical pills

3474.18 --> 3481.46
yeah and that eventually kills you so

3477.02 --> 3481.46
but it didn't start out that way

3487.2 --> 3492.24
anyway it had been plenty exposed with

3490.74 --> 3494.5789999999997
Medical

3492.24 --> 3497.22
insights and knowledge and I've always

3494.579 --> 3499.38
greatly appreciated always had respect

3497.22 --> 3502.04
for doctors for their skill and

3499.38 --> 3502.04
knowledge right

3511.14 --> 3516.0589999999997
it's like if I go to a doctor not that I

3514.26 --> 3517.8590000000004
would at this point but let's just say

3516.059 --> 3520.559
okay it's really important that I get

3517.859 --> 3523.44
some confirmation of a physical checkup

3520.559 --> 3526.38
when I go to a doctor I will actually

3523.44 --> 3529.14
ask him to give me halfway decent

3526.38 --> 3530.099
University level explanations like I

3529.14 --> 3533.64
want

3530.099 --> 3536.28
to described in detail exactly

3533.64 --> 3537.96
why and how and how that relates to

3536.28 --> 3540.299
metabolism now I'll talk about it and

3537.96 --> 3543.7200000000003
talk about it like that will happen

3540.299 --> 3547.2599999999998
guaranteed it happens every single time

3543.72 --> 3550.16
because I am just very interested in the

3547.26 --> 3550.1600000000003
functions of the body

3558.48 --> 3563.099
in a way

3560.76 --> 3564.2400000000002
I had actually considered becoming like

3563.099 --> 3567.059
a doctor

3564.24 --> 3571.5589999999997
when I was in school but then

3567.059 --> 3575.099
looking at what was going to become my

3571.559 --> 3577.8590000000004
path it didn't work

3575.099 --> 3580.799
it didn't work

3577.859 --> 3583.38
I couldn't do it like it was too tough

3580.799 --> 3584.52
the memorization of it all it was too

3583.38 --> 3586.6800000000003
tough for me

3584.52 --> 3590.22
it's too distracted too much of a dream

3586.68 --> 3592.68
I couldn't focus on all that I didn't

3590.22 --> 3595.2
dare maybe if I would have done it then

3592.68 --> 3598.5789999999997
I could have succeeded unexpectedly but

3595.2 --> 3598.5789999999997
I didn't dare at the time

3604.68 --> 3611.04
but yeah my general overview of what

3607.92 --> 3613.44
that would lead to becoming a doctor

3611.04 --> 3615.48
was much more narrow at the time I

3613.44 --> 3618.0
didn't even know there was such a thing

3615.48 --> 3619.44
as like alternative medical doctor I

3618.0 --> 3621.9
didn't know that

3619.44 --> 3625.02
I didn't know there were actual serious

3621.9 --> 3628.92
Alternatives that that were successful I

3625.02 --> 3631.22
didn't know that when I was in school

3628.92 --> 3631.2200000000003
foreign

3634.079 --> 3638.76
the alternative things I knew was like

3636.359 --> 3640.98
Homeopathy that was the alternate like

3638.76 --> 3643.7400000000002
oh that's really alternative

3640.98 --> 3645.96
that was as far as I went

3643.74 --> 3648.0
and just like oh yeah take herbs but you

3645.96 --> 3650.2200000000003
got to be careful but that was never

3648.0 --> 3652.5
really even like oh you could make a

3650.22 --> 3654.4199999999996
real big profession out of that no that

3652.5 --> 3656.599
that had never even entered my mind back

3654.42 --> 3656.599
then

3657.599 --> 3661.44
it was to me was more like oh it's

3659.22 --> 3665.0
really handy having a a mother around

3661.44 --> 3665.0
that knows all these herbs

3676.079 --> 3681.619
body is mainly energetic well it all

3678.24 --> 3681.6189999999997
depends like I'm not gonna

3689.819 --> 3695.16
right I'm not gonna like go to a doctor

3692.04 --> 3697.38
and just ask them about Universal

3695.16 --> 3700.799
functions of the body

3697.38 --> 3702.119
like about how it works when it's in

3700.799 --> 3705.66
optimal condition or anything

3702.119 --> 3708.6600000000003
necessarily I'd rather be asking like

3705.66 --> 3710.16
long-term attrition and like go my

3708.66 --> 3713.0989999999997
personal

3710.16 --> 3715.3799999999997
medical issue details like it bring up

3713.099 --> 3719.539
like my jaw why why is that happening

3715.38 --> 3719.539
why do I seem to have

3719.88 --> 3724.98
like hay fever type

3722.579 --> 3728.46
minor allergies that just

3724.98 --> 3730.799
never really go away

3728.46 --> 3732.9
like you might not have noticed because

3730.799 --> 3736.74
I would have developed a discipline here

3732.9 --> 3738.839
on the early bird show but I sneeze

3736.74 --> 3742.14
pretty regularly

3738.839 --> 3744.18
and I just turned the mic off because I

3742.14 --> 3745.98
don't want some psychosomatic side

3744.18 --> 3748.5589999999997
effect on that but I have that a lot and

3745.98 --> 3750.72
it's always freaking allergy like sneeze

3748.559 --> 3752.52
right it's never like oh I have a cold

3750.72 --> 3755.299
no it's just like suddenly out of

3752.52 --> 3755.299
nowhere it's like ah

3759.539 --> 3763.44
right

3761.64 --> 3766.319
and I've been having that for a long

3763.44 --> 3769.319
time now of course also I drink and I

3766.319 --> 3771.859
smoke so I shouldn't be complaining

3769.319 --> 3771.859
right

3772.92 --> 3777.859
because I'm pretty sure they have an

3775.079 --> 3777.8590000000004
influence on it

3795.0 --> 3800.0
consciously many

3797.22 --> 3800.0
no

3804.539 --> 3808.7990000000004
no there's the conscious and then

3806.579 --> 3811.079
there's the organism it's not conscious

3808.799 --> 3813.839
it's contradicting

3811.079 --> 3816.0
right but yes I've learned about German

3813.839 --> 3820.52
new medicine

3816.0 --> 3820.52
more recently in the last few years and

3822.359 --> 3826.7599999999998
there is

3823.98 --> 3826.76
physical

3826.819 --> 3833.22
manifestations of trauma and especially

3830.46 --> 3835.619
overcoming psychological trauma actually

3833.22 --> 3838.74
results in

3835.619 --> 3842.039
a physical side effect a lot of the time

3838.74 --> 3844.5
like a next like sudden symptoms and

3842.039 --> 3846.7200000000003
they might be very painful just

3844.5 --> 3849.0
seemingly coming out of nowhere

3846.72 --> 3850.74
like literally out of nowhere it might

3849.0 --> 3853.68
just arrive is be like this makes no

3850.74 --> 3856.859
sense ah I hope I don't have cancer or

3853.68 --> 3858.5989999999997
something and it will just go away

3856.859 --> 3860.88
it would just go away just like that

3858.599 --> 3864.0
again right

3860.88 --> 3866.819
now if you're gonna place that into some

3864.0 --> 3869.64
kind of allopathic scenario or

3866.819 --> 3871.5589999999997
allopathic model yeah there's absolute

3869.64 --> 3874.44
that makes none of it makes any sense

3871.559 --> 3876.059
they'll just be like ah oh you were

3874.44 --> 3879.42
suddenly

3876.059 --> 3881.94
because uh something dramatic happened

3879.42 --> 3883.799
but then you were very lucky your body

3881.94 --> 3885.7200000000003
just fixed it again but you were very

3883.799 --> 3887.4
much under risk a German new medicine

3885.72 --> 3892.14
says no

3887.4 --> 3895.26
now that's actually an internal process

3892.14 --> 3899.299
it's like a side effect of the marriage

3895.26 --> 3899.2990000000004
of the Consciousness and the body

3900.599 --> 3904.92
trauma processing

3902.76 --> 3907.8590000000004
it's like a couple

3904.92 --> 3910.099
working it out after they've gone into a

3907.859 --> 3910.0989999999997
fight

3914.16 --> 3918.02
right so that also happens

3922.02 --> 3928.14
so in that sense classical homeopath you

3925.26 --> 3931.3190000000004
could sort of be right that your body

3928.14 --> 3935.5789999999997
does manifest these symptoms

3931.319 --> 3937.02
but it's always in a specific relation

3935.579 --> 3940.319
to

3937.02 --> 3942.72
what your conscious spirit is going

3940.319 --> 3945.799
through in life

3942.72 --> 3945.799
every obstacle

3947.16 --> 3953.52
every trauma even small ones

3950.88 --> 3956.1600000000003
they will have a physical response

3953.52 --> 3958.619
afterward at some point some echo on

3956.16 --> 3960.66
like they don't even fully go away they

3958.619 --> 3964.039
keep on echoing because it's been very

3960.66 --> 3964.0389999999998
deep like it's

3964.559 --> 3972.0
almost like a bodily like subconscious

3968.22 --> 3974.3999999999996
body Obsession right like a very

3972.0 --> 3976.38
impactful idea on the mind can keep on

3974.4 --> 3977.94
echoing coming back that could be bad

3976.38 --> 3979.7400000000002
too that could be an addiction or

3977.94 --> 3981.7200000000003
something it keeps on echoing back even

3979.74 --> 3985.4399999999996
way after it's like no longer really

3981.72 --> 3987.24
relevant and your constant situation

3985.44 --> 3990.66
but your mind just keeps going back

3987.24 --> 3992.819
right because of the original impact on

3990.66 --> 3996.0589999999997
your mind and how much it has gripped

3992.819 --> 3999.18
you well in the same sense

3996.059 --> 4001.88
symptoms can potentially echo on

3999.18 --> 4006.2
physically

4001.88 --> 4006.2000000000003
as the trauma responds

4007.16 --> 4013.64
like your body got obsessed by the

4010.64 --> 4016.52
original trauma transformation and

4013.64 --> 4018.74
Echoes it on like a subconscious

4016.52 --> 4022.96
obsession

4018.74 --> 4022.9599999999996
maybe a little weird comparison

4024.2 --> 4027.2
arthritis

4027.559 --> 4030.099
laughs

4031.339 --> 4034.0589999999997
right

4052.64 --> 4057.799
right but anyway I'm getting a little

4055.099 --> 4059.96
ethereal here concerning this so I'm

4057.799 --> 4063.099
gonna discontinue this

4059.96 --> 4063.099
train of thinking

4068.059 --> 4074.02
but yeah psychosomatics man

4071.24 --> 4074.02
and

4074.78 --> 4078.619
like

4076.16 --> 4082.339
physical

4078.619 --> 4084.1400000000003
response to psychological trauma like

4082.339 --> 4086.0589999999997
that is a thing

4084.14 --> 4088.46
physical response to psychological

4086.059 --> 4090.559
trauma that's real

4088.46 --> 4092.78
that's something that I would emphasize

4090.559 --> 4095.8390000000004
as something that exists so people

4092.78 --> 4100.339
realize it physical response to

4095.839 --> 4102.98
psychological trauma and this is also

4100.339 --> 4105.08
Incorporated

4102.98 --> 4106.218999999999
trauma

4105.08 --> 4109.219
right

4106.219 --> 4109.219
demoralization

4110.0 --> 4113.199
yeah

4111.44 --> 4115.159
that's real

4113.199 --> 4117.08
demoralization

4115.159 --> 4119.5
has even

4117.08 --> 4123.5
as palpable

4119.5 --> 4123.5
physiological consequences

4124.64 --> 4128.659000000001
we got a model

4126.56 --> 4131.06
through Gerber new medicine yeah

4128.659 --> 4134.379999999999
demoralization

4131.06 --> 4134.38
has physical

4135.679 --> 4139.88
consequences

4137.239 --> 4143.299
for the person

4139.88 --> 4146.839
not because of the actions that that

4143.299 --> 4151.699
they will strive towards or will

4146.839 --> 4154.7789999999995
proceed into engaging because of it but

4151.699 --> 4158.839
just because of the natural physical

4154.779 --> 4161.179
system the conjunction between spirit

4158.839 --> 4166.1
and body

4161.179 --> 4169.6990000000005
there will be a bodily side effect

4166.1 --> 4172.9400000000005
to trauma and well German medicine says

4169.699 --> 4175.699
to overcoming that trauma to actually

4172.94 --> 4178.339
resolving it

4175.699 --> 4181.4
again going back to the metaphor of the

4178.339 --> 4184.759
couple having a fight and then making up

4181.4 --> 4186.799
afterward well that that resolvement

4184.759 --> 4189.02
that's basically when the couple makes

4186.799 --> 4189.92
up with sex right after they've talked

4189.02 --> 4191.2390000000005
it out

4189.92 --> 4193.04
if they

4191.239 --> 4196.178999999999
still do that

4193.04 --> 4196.179
if they feel like it

4196.58 --> 4203.42
you know for Comet you have

4200.08 --> 4207.44
inflammation some kind you have pain of

4203.42 --> 4209.4800000000005
some kind it's short it's palpable it

4207.44 --> 4212.719
might even like frustrate you highly

4209.48 --> 4215.54
typically that's what I get

4212.719 --> 4218.0
almost got panicky from it but it also

4215.54 --> 4219.62
goes away again

4218.0 --> 4222.5
and then

4219.62 --> 4224.719
in that specific manifestation form it

4222.5 --> 4228.08
rarely comes back

4224.719 --> 4231.02
if you truly overcome

4228.08 --> 4234.62
the trauma the psychological trauma that

4231.02 --> 4237.7390000000005
can be like a very long time ago even

4234.62 --> 4239.9
and the longer ago it is the more impact

4237.739 --> 4243.759999999999
it will have made

4239.9 --> 4243.759999999999
usually the more intense

4244.34 --> 4250.4800000000005
the effect the bodily effect as your

4247.699 --> 4250.48
response to that

4256.94 --> 4263.379999999999
but yeah it's it's very good to keep in

4259.1 --> 4267.280000000001
mind that effectively demoralization has

4263.38 --> 4267.28
physiological consequences

4268.46 --> 4274.4
outside of actions that

4271.64 --> 4275.719
the Consciousness might take that would

4274.4 --> 4278.12
lead to

4275.719 --> 4281.6
bad consequence or whatever

4278.12 --> 4285.0199999999995
just going through demoralization has

4281.6 --> 4287.659000000001
physiological consequences

4285.02 --> 4292.2390000000005
that's something to remember

4287.659 --> 4292.239
because it is a very profound fact

4292.52 --> 4297.9400000000005
that is widely overlooked and

4295.219 --> 4297.94
underestimated

4302.239 --> 4304.36
okay

4307.58 --> 4313.9
physical trauma can lead to mental

4309.739 --> 4313.9
symptoms yes that also

4315.08 --> 4318.28
but again that's

4319.34 --> 4324.08
that's much more easy to reason out

4321.62 --> 4326.0
because it's usually like oh the the

4324.08 --> 4330.26
shock

4326.0 --> 4331.58
or the anguish or The Unwanted alter

4330.26 --> 4335.0
Rage or something right the

4331.58 --> 4336.92
psychological trauma is much easier

4335.0 --> 4339.38
to point at

4336.92 --> 4341.6
that comes from physical trauma the

4339.38 --> 4343.34
other way around is much more Elusive

4341.6 --> 4345.820000000001
and mysterious

4343.34 --> 4345.82
right

4348.26 --> 4353.659000000001
you can't just reason it out really

4350.84 --> 4356.3
easily on the spot

4353.659 --> 4359.0
which you can with psychology

4356.3 --> 4361.1
when the situation is reversed

4359.0 --> 4364.04
so it's different

4361.1 --> 4365.96
everybody can easily imagine how

4364.04 --> 4367.159
physical trauma can lead to mental

4365.96 --> 4370.1
symptoms

4367.159 --> 4371.839999999999
everybody can easily imagine that right

4370.1 --> 4373.88
even if you haven't

4371.84 --> 4375.92
personally gone through a dramatic

4373.88 --> 4378.4400000000005
situation like that

4375.92 --> 4381.1990000000005
but the other way around that's not so

4378.44 --> 4383.919999999999
easy to understand you that doesn't flow

4381.199 --> 4383.919999999999
as naturally

4399.5 --> 4403.659
hmm anyway yeah it's been uh

4404.96 --> 4410.38
stimulating show actually very medical

4407.9 --> 4410.379999999999
today

4412.699 --> 4418.82
it just happened I didn't plan for that

4416.78 --> 4421.719
just happened to roll out

4418.82 --> 4421.719
and I like it

4459.62 --> 4463.219
right uh

4463.46 --> 4467.199
maybe I should round out the show

4467.239 --> 4469.419999999999
foreign

4494.0 --> 4497.26
yeah I will

4497.9 --> 4503.48
did I start late

4500.36 --> 4506.199
yeah little but I've already went over

4503.48 --> 4506.199
the hour mark

4511.76 --> 4517.88
and since yeah the show is now pretty

4513.98 --> 4522.099999999999
much been very consistent

4517.88 --> 4522.1
piece monologue Maybe

4522.739 --> 4529.58
yeah there's no need to like just wait

4526.34 --> 4531.56
yeah talk about not

4529.58 --> 4534.14
the same level

4531.56 --> 4536.54
subject for another 15 minutes because

4534.14 --> 4539.0
it pretty much said everything about it

4536.54 --> 4540.44
that's neat that needs to be set right

4539.0 --> 4542.719
now

4540.44 --> 4544.099999999999
can't think of anything to add on to

4542.719 --> 4545.9
that all that

4544.1 --> 4547.04
right so I think I'm just gonna round

4545.9 --> 4550.879999999999
out

4547.04 --> 4552.92
right so thanks everyone for coming

4550.88 --> 4554.96
