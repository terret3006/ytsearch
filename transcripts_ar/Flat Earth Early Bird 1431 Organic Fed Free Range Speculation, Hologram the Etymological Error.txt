all right

101.22 --> 105.42
so yeah the weather has

106.04 --> 111.38000000000001
miraculously turned around and I mean

109.14 --> 112.92
really

111.38 --> 115.69999999999999
just

112.92 --> 115.7
incredible

117.0 --> 122.82
it was still like slightly cloudy this

119.46 --> 125.399
morning and some came shining through

122.82 --> 127.38
but then like all the clouds just

125.399 --> 130.099
cleared off

127.38 --> 130.099
completely

131.099 --> 137.16
so now it's a bright blue sky

135.12 --> 140.52
with a lot of sun

137.16 --> 143.66
and also little wind so it's it's really

140.52 --> 143.66
nice out there

150.58 --> 153.669
[Music]

155.16 --> 157.7
all right

162.36 --> 165.36
ah

163.58 --> 169.14000000000001
[Music]

165.36 --> 175.62
starting on time for a change

169.14 --> 175.61999999999998
it is Thursday the 24th of November 2022

175.739 --> 179.59900000000002
that one is in the chat just yet

179.64 --> 186.47899999999998
oh there's a lot of lighting in here

183.29 --> 186.47899999999998
[Music]

187.86 --> 192.20000000000002
especially like the wall right behind me

192.42 --> 195.01899999999998
foreign

196.4 --> 200.54
look at the contrast changing

200.64 --> 204.73899999999998
weird weird how that works

207.0 --> 209.72
right

211.739 --> 217.34
so yeah I've been watching some Owen

214.44 --> 217.34
Benjamin again

218.459 --> 223.799
it's getting very interesting I mean he

221.459 --> 225.78
had Gardner on

223.799 --> 228.9
um yeah I was continue watching that

225.78 --> 231.84
then I got kind of agitated

228.9 --> 234.739
because there was literally ether

231.84 --> 234.739
nonsense in there

235.019 --> 239.159
and

237.659 --> 240.72
I mean

239.159 --> 243.84
it's a mess

240.72 --> 246.42
that is a mess and both of these guys

243.84 --> 249.599
think that they really got it there but

246.42 --> 253.439
it's wrong and including Gardner and

249.599 --> 254.459
yeah he's very sophisticated and very

253.439 --> 257.579
subtle

254.459 --> 260.76
but he's wrong with that

257.579 --> 262.44
and I would love to be able to challenge

260.76 --> 263.46
him I don't think that's ever going to

262.44 --> 265.259
happen

263.46 --> 267.23999999999995
but

265.259 --> 270.41900000000004
yeah I mean

267.24 --> 272.699
you can reference Tesla all you like

270.419 --> 274.979
concerning ether it doesn't make it a

272.699 --> 277.56
real thing it's only a model it only

274.979 --> 281.88
ever was a model

277.56 --> 285.18
now of course there's other things like

281.88 --> 288.54
the idea of electric ether and spirit

285.18 --> 291.0
ether very much so the problem is is

288.54 --> 292.91900000000004
that people tend to mix them up and just

291.0 --> 294.56
kind of make it into one thing and it

292.919 --> 295.79999999999995
becomes a giant mess

294.56 --> 297.36
[Music]

295.8 --> 299.639
all right

297.36 --> 301.91900000000004
[Music]

299.639 --> 304.5
other than that I did there was some

301.919 --> 307.32
discussion also about

304.5 --> 309.9
the celestials and how the

307.32 --> 312.0
well they assume a circle let's just say

309.9 --> 314.58
they literally think it's a disc and

312.0 --> 316.94
including Gardner's disc because of

314.58 --> 316.94
airplane

317.4 --> 324.38
so that's what he thinks and yeah so he

320.52 --> 324.38
is basically a disco like that

325.56 --> 331.44
but he had some interesting idea about

328.32 --> 332.699
how potentially the magnetic pole

331.44 --> 336.86
shifting

332.699 --> 340.08000000000004
can also lead to the solar cycle

336.86 --> 342.12
shifting like or assumed to be Circle

340.08 --> 343.139
shifting that was a very interesting

342.12 --> 345.12
idea

343.139 --> 346.919
and led to all kinds of speculation

345.12 --> 349.08
about what happened in the past that was

346.919 --> 350.75899999999996
very interesting I mean that's like my

349.08 --> 352.85999999999996
cup of tea That's the sort of thing that

350.759 --> 354.06
I like to talk about

352.86 --> 356.88
but

354.06 --> 359.22
I mean I had to stop watching at some

356.88 --> 363.479
point it just got to disrupt it it's

359.22 --> 367.199
it's literally to me poisoning the gravy

363.479 --> 370.74
because it was really awesome but they

367.199 --> 372.72
just threw in this grab this this gravel

370.74 --> 376.44
nonsense

372.72 --> 378.6
and it really agitated me

376.44 --> 380.699
like that that ruined it for me and it's

378.6 --> 383.699
happened before

380.699 --> 386.90000000000003
so something weird

383.699 --> 386.90000000000003
something weird there

390.0 --> 396.36
it definitely makes me not

392.479 --> 399.9
unconditionally trust Gardner

396.36 --> 402.66
I mean I really like the guy but I do

399.9 --> 404.88
not fully trust him because of just some

402.66 --> 406.62
of the things that he seems to keep

404.88 --> 408.78
reinforcing

406.62 --> 410.46
and I mean the information is out there

408.78 --> 412.979
he should be able to get it there is

410.46 --> 415.62
bears that follow the Flat Earth debates

412.979 --> 417.84
too and that follow me that they all

415.62 --> 421.4
interact with each other they should

417.84 --> 421.4
know all of them

424.5 --> 430.08
absolutely [Â __Â ] Dana I've been talking a

427.259 --> 433.62
very consistently about

430.08 --> 439.85999999999996
the issues that also are applicable to

433.62 --> 445.819
that stream for years they should know

439.86 --> 445.819
yet they what forget choose to ignore it

445.919 --> 453.06
I certainly hope they're not pulling a

449.52 --> 455.52
yeah a glowbusters on us I really hope

453.06 --> 457.86
it for them that they're not doing that

455.52 --> 460.38
because that's not gonna end well and I

457.86 --> 462.66
don't mean oh who's going to turn out to

460.38 --> 465.979
be right on the internet I mean

462.66 --> 465.97900000000004
beyond that

466.21 --> 469.53999999999996
[Music]

469.68 --> 474.38
hello Mike sadunich first in chat good

471.96 --> 474.38
to see you

474.9 --> 478.039
it took long enough

478.7 --> 488.759
[Music]

486.479 --> 491.699
right so that's kind of what I was

488.759 --> 494.819
watching right before the show also

491.699 --> 497.84000000000003
digging in 10 minutes of the new show

494.819 --> 497.84000000000003
from Wednesday

498.539 --> 501.539
foreign

503.419 --> 509.28
Thomas Jefferson Bible basically very

507.3 --> 512.279
fascinating

509.28 --> 514.5
just this one quote directly from a

512.279 --> 519.0
Jefferson was like oh my God that's

514.5 --> 522.44
absolutely totally On Target like so

519.0 --> 522.44
untargeted surreal

522.599 --> 527.7
so I'm thinking of if that's even

525.48 --> 530.1
possible I I want to get a Jefferson

527.7 --> 534.32
Bible I want to get one

530.1 --> 534.32
I I want to check it out I think

535.5 --> 541.1
yeah I think I might become a real big

538.26 --> 541.1
fan of that book

541.74 --> 544.399
I might

547.44 --> 553.2600000000001
because it tackles paulism

550.98 --> 556.5
in a very serious way

553.26 --> 558.24
and not just in some kind of a polarized

556.5 --> 560.94
savanye way

558.24 --> 562.04
no a very serious and philosophical it's

560.94 --> 566.1600000000001
brilliant

562.04 --> 568.8
just that one quote mate is already like

566.16 --> 571.38
sufficient to know like that thing's

568.8 --> 574.1999999999999
gonna be very serious

571.38 --> 578.16
so I'm very curious to

574.2 --> 582.98
see if at some point I could get one

578.16 --> 582.98
anyway where the hell is everybody

586.08 --> 589.76
I'm talking for 10 minutes

589.79 --> 593.02
[Music]

600.98 --> 606.019
oh my God I will refresh

613.019 --> 616.7
I mean is everybody just

617.1 --> 621.6
not

618.6 --> 625.1
awake or

621.6 --> 625.1
what the hell's going on

625.2 --> 630.48
everybody's sleeping in this morning why

628.56 --> 632.66
is it like because of Thanksgiving or

630.48 --> 632.66
something

637.5 --> 643.459
oh Craig Burton yeah listening that's

640.2 --> 643.4590000000001
that's that's great

643.85 --> 648.6
[Music]

645.839 --> 650.6400000000001
I mean yeah of course just let Arwin

648.6 --> 653.4590000000001
talk two hours

650.64 --> 656.16
facing an empty chat I mean that's

653.459 --> 657.54
totally reasonable right I mean anybody

656.16 --> 661.019
can keep up

657.54 --> 663.66
two hours a day being solo on on live

661.019 --> 666.9590000000001
cam with barely anything in chat to

663.66 --> 669.56
reflect on yes I mean that's totally

666.959 --> 669.56
reasonable

671.48 --> 688.769
[Music]

700.2 --> 703.2
foreign

721.339 --> 724.8000000000001
to do the show

723.66 --> 727.079
where

724.8 --> 729.66
it basically

727.079 --> 732.0
yeah like other streamers typically have

729.66 --> 734.459
where it does announce a time and then

732.0 --> 737.279
it goes live I don't know why I'm not

734.459 --> 739.6199999999999
able to just have that

737.279 --> 741.36
I used to be able to do that but it's

739.62 --> 743.279
just not yeah

741.36 --> 745.92
too much of a hassle I need to figure it

743.279 --> 749.22
out because maybe I just need to do it

745.92 --> 753.959
differently and just well

749.22 --> 757.22
let people in chat and then I go live

753.959 --> 761.2199999999999
after at least five different people

757.22 --> 763.0790000000001
have said something in my chat

761.22 --> 765.899
right

763.079 --> 767.579
and then hey if nobody shows up for two

765.899 --> 771.72
hours straight

767.579 --> 774.56
then I'm just not gonna do a live show

771.72 --> 774.5600000000001
how about that

782.79 --> 792.06
[Music]

789.42 --> 794.16
yes yes are we in great idea thanks for

792.06 --> 797.579
all the feedback guys I mean

794.16 --> 800.399
finally some response

797.579 --> 803.0
everybody cares

800.399 --> 803.0
it's great

806.339 --> 810.5400000000001
sure glad that at the end of my show

808.62 --> 812.22
everybody will still tell me it's a

810.54 --> 815.639
great show Even though like the first

812.22 --> 817.44
half hour like it's completely dead I'm

815.639 --> 820.019
just like

817.44 --> 822.6
feeling like I'm on the corner of some

820.019 --> 826.26
abandoned Street just

822.6 --> 830.899
trying to get something happening I mean

826.26 --> 830.899
is that really a great show is it

831.24 --> 835.92
I mean maybe if you get like through the

833.82 --> 839.399
first half I wonder sometimes if people

835.92 --> 842.3
just like skip to like

839.399 --> 842.3
like an hour

843.18 --> 848.6999999999999
I mean I would at this point with the

845.76 --> 851.54
chat the way it goes typically now

848.7 --> 851.5400000000001
I would do that

858.79 --> 863.579
[Music]

861.6 --> 866.1800000000001
okay

863.579 --> 866.18
right

867.21 --> 870.32
[Music]

896.1 --> 898.6990000000001
foreign

903.5 --> 907.44
[Music]

905.42 --> 911.16
you know what

907.44 --> 912.48
since nobody seems to give a [Â __Â ]

911.16 --> 916.4399999999999
huh

912.48 --> 920.16
I'm just gonna unban everybody yeah just

916.44 --> 922.5
let the troll [Â __Â ] back in [Â __Â ] all

920.16 --> 925.62
over it and how about I'm just not gonna

922.5 --> 929.519
ban them this time because at least they

925.62 --> 932.46
[Â __Â ] show up and say something

929.519 --> 935.649
huh

932.46 --> 935.649
[Music]

964.199 --> 969.3199999999999
foreign

966.019 --> 969.32
there you go

974.699 --> 980.88
yes I've heard about beyond the polls

978.06 --> 985.16
I have a pdf version on my computer I

980.88 --> 985.16
think but it's not easy to find

988.56 --> 995.04
right also it is basically just the

991.86 --> 995.04
story it's

995.459 --> 999.9799999999999
very likely to be completely made of

1000.62 --> 1004.82
but

1001.88 --> 1007.519
it's still very fascinating

1004.82 --> 1009.9200000000001
and it might be an assembly

1007.519 --> 1014.199
of different experiences that a person

1009.92 --> 1014.199
has gathered via VIA talking

1014.72 --> 1020.9590000000001
or he had a

1017.48 --> 1023.779
very serious like psychotic break with

1020.959 --> 1026.12
heavy hallucination and he basically did

1023.779 --> 1028.28
that like in the Dark World

1026.12 --> 1030.319
and he could have literally experienced

1028.28 --> 1031.6399999999999
all that

1030.319 --> 1036.459
like that

1031.64 --> 1036.459
it's it's gonna remain a mystery

1037.579 --> 1043.6399999999999
talking about that book right about the

1040.52 --> 1046.16
guy going with his dad to the North Pole

1043.64 --> 1048.6200000000001
meeting Giants and then going through

1046.16 --> 1053.14
the rivers ending up in the South Pole

1048.62 --> 1053.1399999999999
coming out in the South that one right

1058.46 --> 1063.98
very expensive Hui

1061.58 --> 1067.059
right well at the time it was considered

1063.98 --> 1067.059
a propaganda book

1074.84 --> 1080.0
so that's what I remember

1078.2 --> 1081.799
I think they even classified it under

1080.0 --> 1085.78
Nazi propaganda now whether that

1081.799 --> 1085.78
literally was that is another matter

1086.74 --> 1090.529
[Music]

1092.02 --> 1100.12
yeah the Earth is flat it is measurably

1097.4 --> 1100.1200000000001
flat

1100.76 --> 1107.0
all of it it's all flat geometric

1104.299 --> 1108.98
orientation of the surface is flat and

1107.0 --> 1112.4
it is parallel

1108.98 --> 1114.98
like every part it's exactly parallel to

1112.4 --> 1116.8300000000002

15 degree per hour drift because it was

1142.22 --> 1146.9
broken

1144.02 --> 1149.059
yeah if you read the instruction manual

1146.9 --> 1151.039
of any gyroscope and they'll come with

1149.059 --> 1153.799
instruction manuals all right

1151.039 --> 1156.2
you'll notice that there is a statement

1153.799 --> 1157.22
that oh yeah yeah if it's if it's

1156.2 --> 1160.46
drifting

1157.22 --> 1162.98
need to contact the the

1160.46 --> 1165.08
your

1162.98 --> 1168.02
like your factory

1165.08 --> 1169.9399999999998
because it's broken yeah that's that's

1168.02 --> 1175.22
why I drifted because it was broken and

1169.94 --> 1177.74
Bob was too stupid to to realize that

1175.22 --> 1180.52
I just didn't want to ignore it probably

1177.74 --> 1180.52
ignored it

1181.1 --> 1183.4599999999998
yeah

1183.86 --> 1191.4799999999998

1186.86 --> 1192.58

broken if it's gonna drift it's probably

1206.48 --> 1209.6200000000001
going to keep drifting

Google Now insists that all gyroscopes

1346.76 --> 1351.34
one will drift less like what

1469.4 --> 1476.659
I'm explaining eclipses yeah it's lights

1472.36 --> 1479.059
then something cuts off the lights

1476.659 --> 1481.5800000000002
that's how I explain that yeah it's

1479.059 --> 1484.8799999999999
lights oh look there's something getting

1481.58 --> 1488.4189999999999
in the way of the apparent Visage

1484.88 --> 1491.9
of that light oh yeah no it's that's

1488.419 --> 1494.24
called eclipsed it's something

1491.9 --> 1497.1200000000001
preventing the celestial light from

1494.24 --> 1499.82
manifesting that's what an eclipse is

1497.12 --> 1503.6
why it works that way I have no idea

1499.82 --> 1505.7
seems to be very specific Celestial

1512.48 --> 1517.78
there is no causal explanation for it

1518.0 --> 1522.679
I mean you don't even know where these

1520.46 --> 1525.26
lights are they're non-local Holograms

1522.679 --> 1527.299
you can't even pinpoint them oh you

1525.26 --> 1528.7
can't pinpoint them oh but we can

1527.299 --> 1531.98
definitely

1528.7 --> 1534.6200000000001
explain why eclipses

1531.98 --> 1537.559
really something that you can't even

1534.62 --> 1540.1399999999999
pinpoint as an object in in a specific

1540.14 --> 1545.2
eclipses okay right sure

1545.24 --> 1549.679
proof they are Holograms the [Â __Â ] is

1548.12 --> 1552.6789999999999
that supposed to mean

1549.679 --> 1553.88
it's a light I can't very manipulate

1552.679 --> 1555.919
them

1553.88 --> 1557.5390000000002

1555.919 --> 1560.6000000000001
Holograms

1557.539 --> 1563.12
I call them Holograms because they are

1560.6 --> 1566.539
images of light that's literally what

1563.12 --> 1568.52
the Hologram the word means

1566.539 --> 1573.2

1568.52 --> 1576.8799999999999
light Hollow gram image hologram

light there

1581.84 --> 1588.62
there's an image we can see it the light

1584.96 --> 1591.38

1588.62 --> 1595.2199999999998
technically it is a hologram

1591.38 --> 1596.8400000000001

1599.539 --> 1605.84

1602.84 --> 1608.48
it off through some man-made thing

1605.84 --> 1611.3799999999999

if you can prove it's a hologram well we

you can't very manipulate it but

1878.72 --> 1882.799
technically

with the information available status

1882.799 --> 1889.52
Moretz it is a hologram

1886.039 --> 1891.799
it is etymologically literally a

1889.52 --> 1895.1

1891.799 --> 1896.48
the information that we can register and

1895.1 --> 1900.1589999999999
process

1896.48 --> 1905.48
yeah we have that information we have

1900.159 --> 1908.8400000000001
image of light based information it is a

1905.48 --> 1912.44
hologram it is technically a hologram

1908.84 --> 1916.039
you understand technically

1912.44 --> 1918.799
not not the piece of engineering

1916.039 --> 1921.3799999999999
and make a 3D image oh you can turn

1918.799 --> 1924.5
around no no no no no not not a piece of

1921.38 --> 1927.5
engineering a literal image of light it

1924.5 --> 1929.899
is an image of light the data for it to

1927.5 --> 1933.14
be an image of light is there and all

1929.899 --> 1936.62
evidence of any physical approachable

1933.14 --> 1940.46
nature and a location in space is

1936.62 --> 1945.08
completely and utterly elusive

1940.46 --> 1947.6000000000001
so it is a hologram whether you want to

1945.08 --> 1950.779
call it a hologram or not that's your

1947.6 --> 1954.4399999999998
own problem it technically is

1950.779 --> 1957.14
there is the information of it being a

1954.44 --> 1959.539
light based image of light interaction

1957.14 --> 1964.46
through the celestials or appearing to

1959.539 --> 1966.3799999999999
be so interaction on earth right

1964.46 --> 1969.26
and that's it that's the information we

1966.38 --> 1971.6000000000001
have it is technically a hologram and

1969.26 --> 1974.059
hey if you want to prove something that

1971.6 --> 1976.82
this proves that assertion well let's

1974.059 --> 1980.72
prove that physical nature then huh

1976.82 --> 1982.76
to do a moon radio signal rebounds yeah

1980.72 --> 1986.539
according to my setup where you can

1982.76 --> 1988.94
actually aim the radio signal at the

1986.539 --> 1990.14
moon and prove that you are aiming it at

1988.94 --> 1992.419
the Moon

1990.14 --> 1995.72
and not at the moon and then let's see

1992.419 --> 1998.419
that signal go up and down

1995.72 --> 2000.46
yeah live yeah show that proof that it

1998.419 --> 2002.5590000000002
is physical yeah I mean if you're gonna

2000.46 --> 2005.32
claim it's a ball of dirt

2002.559 --> 2008.08
then it should be uh yeah

2005.32 --> 2010.0
having this physical barrier for a

2008.08 --> 2012.76
signal to bounce off

2010.0 --> 2015.159
so prove it then prove it that it is not

2012.76 --> 2017.74
a hologram

2015.159 --> 2020.0800000000002

2348.46 --> 2351.339
assembled and what that was supposed to

2350.44 --> 2356.26
mean

2351.339 --> 2359.04

Hollow Graham

2361.9 --> 2367.96
light image

2364.5 --> 2369.46
hologram light image that's it that's

2367.96 --> 2373.92
how I'm using it

2369.46 --> 2379.48
yeah it's a new utilization of the word

2373.92 --> 2381.64
where before there was no word to use

2379.48 --> 2386.82
do you understand

2381.64 --> 2386.8199999999997

2455.2 --> 2458.3999999999996
it was like light

2460.0 --> 2466.839
whole letter

2462.64 --> 2469.24

2466.839 --> 2471.7
why the hell does it mean it like why

2469.24 --> 2475.5
does it mean that then

2471.7 --> 2478.5989999999997
if it doesn't mean image or light

2475.5 --> 2480.64
whole letter or line

2478.599 --> 2482.94
like what the [Â __Â ] does that even mean

oh my God okay well I guess I'll have to

2493.06 --> 2498.46
invent a new word because freaking

2495.099 --> 2502.0
hologram literally makes no sense

2498.46 --> 2503.619

a projection then there you are

automatically claiming a projector

2595.3 --> 2601.3
there's no projection without a

2597.04 --> 2604.54

2617.44 --> 2619.92
out before

2624.579 --> 2632.1400000000003
I mean I've said hologram

2629.44 --> 2636.0
means image of light

2632.14 --> 2639.4
like even on fed like dozens of time

2636.0 --> 2641.5
nobody ever talked and nobody has ever

2639.4 --> 2644.14
[Â __Â ] told me

2641.5 --> 2647.819
that that just wasn't correct

I mean just literally just nobody

2651.52 --> 2655.319
actually listened to what I say

why has nobody corrected me on the

2660.64 --> 2665.7
etymology of this in [Â __Â ] four years

2666.76 --> 2675.42

okay so it's like

2757.079 --> 2763.7200000000003
based on Old photography but basically

2760.839 --> 2767.2599999999998
getting creative with it there is okay

2763.72 --> 2769.4199999999996

2869.079 --> 2874.96
I mean in my eyes this is literally

enough to completely negate my entire

respect ever even

2931.72 --> 2938.14
said anything yeah a bunch of gamma's

2934.78 --> 2940.48
constantly whining and nagging saying

2938.14 --> 2943.24
things are wrong yeah of course I'm

2940.48 --> 2944.8
gonna ignore that you're [Â __Â ] retards

2943.24 --> 2946.839
why the hell would I believe anything

2944.8 --> 2948.28
you have to say anyway

right

2952.26 --> 2961.0
let it roll and not check anything

2957.839 --> 2966.359

2973.66 --> 2977.98
yeah you can't think of a better word

2975.46 --> 2980.68
yeah I know I know right but now see

2977.98 --> 2983.7400000000002
here's the problem I had an etymology

2980.68 --> 2986.2
claim concerning the word hologram

2983.74 --> 2991.06
that was kind of like my Escape card

2986.2 --> 2992.68
guess what to avoid the [Â __Â ] man-made

2991.06 --> 2996.5789999999997
device

2992.68 --> 3000.1189999999997
because if you revert to oh they're like

2996.579 --> 3003.78
that man-made device yeah there is

3000.119 --> 3006.96
endless amounts of problems with that

3003.78 --> 3008.3390000000004
because it isn't like that device it's

3006.96 --> 3012.0
non-local

3008.339 --> 3015.839
the device literally has a projector

3012.0 --> 3017.94
source of the light to to manifest that

3015.839 --> 3019.92
yeah so there's oh where's the light

3017.94 --> 3022.4
switch coming from like an endless

3019.92 --> 3027.8
whining

3022.4 --> 3027.8
endless whining because of this now

3034.619 --> 3040.1600000000003

3037.38 --> 3040.1600000000003
piece of [Â __Â ]

3051.119 --> 3056.579
so yeah yeah okay cool cool it's a

3054.0 --> 3058.98
hologram yeah and I'm guess I'm not

3056.579 --> 3061.02
gonna say that it's etymologically

3058.98 --> 3063.3
correct anymore

3061.02 --> 3066.0
right I had to figure that out for

3063.3 --> 3067.92
myself after basically doing that for

3066.0 --> 3071.579
years

3067.92 --> 3074.16
and nobody that cared about me actually

3071.579 --> 3076.94
took the effort to point it out how that

3074.16 --> 3076.94
it was wrong

3079.2 --> 3085.74
and act like actually pointed out I mean

3082.02 --> 3088.319
yeah I think Nathan or among others has

3085.74 --> 3089.64
said like no no it's not a hologram

3088.319 --> 3091.5589999999997
but

3089.64 --> 3094.319
that's it

3091.559 --> 3097.92
he never actually took the [Â __Â ]

3094.319 --> 3098.7
effort to tell me hey have you looked it

3097.92 --> 3102.599
up

3098.7 --> 3106.02
it doesn't mean image of light

3102.599 --> 3107.579
etymologically Arwin no nobody [Â __Â ]

3106.02 --> 3109.44
told me

3107.579 --> 3111.3590000000004
and yeah oh I should have looked it up

3109.44 --> 3112.98
myself yeah it's [Â __Â ] embarrassing

3111.359 --> 3114.7799999999997
I'm literally sweating with

3112.98 --> 3117.839
embarrassment here

3114.78 --> 3121.26
yeah I am embarrassed I was really

3117.839 --> 3123.9
terribly wrong persistently and nobody

3121.26 --> 3125.579
[Â __Â ] told me

3123.9 --> 3128.64
bye

3125.579 --> 3131.28
except for [Â __Â ] trolls

3128.64 --> 3133.02
that nobody listens to because they're

3131.28 --> 3134.4
pieces of [Â __Â ] and they don't give a

3133.02 --> 3136.5
[Â __Â ]

so why the hell would anybody listen to

3136.5 --> 3141.839
that okay

3138.9 --> 3147.3
why did nobody point it out

3141.839 --> 3150.72
do any of you ever look anything up ever

you just put it on like that radio

3179.819 --> 3185.7

more words in detail before I even

3189.119 --> 3196.079
attempt to improvise anything anymore

3192.96 --> 3198.9

3196.079 --> 3202.46

you must point out if I'm technically

3974.94 --> 3981.98
technically flawed about something

3977.4 --> 3981.98
even if I'm trying something weird

3982.02 --> 3987.42

3985.02 --> 3990.079
but I guess that some things were

3987.42 --> 3990.079
overlooked

because of it

3994.799 --> 3999.599
I actually feel kind of sick but in a

3999.599 --> 4003.98
this is

4000.859 --> 4006.16
shame sickness I am really ashamed right

4003.98 --> 4006.16
now

4008.48 --> 4012.559
and I'm trying to use my spirit to look

4011.599 --> 4016.9
like

4012.559 --> 4016.9
what can I do to prevent this

4017.059 --> 4022.94
I don't want to ever bump into anything

4020.299 --> 4028.18
like this ever again

4022.94 --> 4028.18
I never want this to happen ever again

4028.64 --> 4035.48
I guess that I will do meticulous

4031.88 --> 4038.42
research from now on every time I get

4035.48 --> 4040.46
some weird spontaneous idea there's

4038.42 --> 4044.059
probably no more room for spontaneous

4040.46 --> 4047.059

no aliens involved yeah but it is a

4605.48 --> 4609.98
and it'll leave open of course that

4607.64 --> 4611.719
aliens could be involved it's just not

4609.98 --> 4613.4
focusing on that I haven't actually

4611.719 --> 4615.679
watched the thing I watched a little bit

ban all the troll shitty socks again

4730.159 --> 4735.759999999999
like you will never have a place here I

4733.159 --> 4735.759999999999
hope you understand

4737.179 --> 4739.659
never

4749.0 --> 4753.62
I mean yeah you could get banned because

4751.28 --> 4756.139999999999
you're in a really shitty mood today or

4753.62 --> 4757.88
whatever and then yeah if I unban

4756.14 --> 4760.34
everybody well you'll have another

4757.88 --> 4762.7390000000005
chance but if the first thing you are

4760.34 --> 4766.46
gonna do is get in here and immediately

4762.739 --> 4768.44
be a troll [Â __Â ] again

4766.46 --> 4770.96
it's just gonna mean that you're gonna

4768.44 --> 4773.12
be immediately banned again I have no

4770.96 --> 4775.58
problem with that

4773.12 --> 4777.679
yeah and some people will just

4775.58 --> 4780.88
immediately be banned unconditionally

4777.679 --> 4780.88
like that guy

4782.42 --> 4785.4400000000005

4852.31 --> 4855.549
[Music]

4868.64 --> 4873.56
right anyway as I was saying I was

4871.64 --> 4876.679
talking about it with John apparently he

4873.56 --> 4880.04
did debate me for like an hour a whole

4876.679 --> 4881.56
time ago about the etymology

4880.04 --> 4886.4
and then

4881.56 --> 4888.860000000001
conceded to me basically reinforcing the

4886.4 --> 4891.32
error great

4888.86 --> 4894.199
I literally have an example of somebody

4891.32 --> 4897.38
doing that now in text

4894.199 --> 4900.139999999999
right but he also told me that something

4897.38 --> 4901.6990000000005
that is actually a good point and that

4900.14 --> 4904.58
is

4901.699 --> 4907.879999999999
instead of hologram

4904.58 --> 4910.159
I could just say what I kind of used to

4907.88 --> 4911.78
say it's it's weird it's not

4910.159 --> 4916.58
etymological anymore but it is a good

4911.78 --> 4919.78
saying just call it an image of light

4916.58 --> 4921.82
and that way technically I even bypass

4919.78 --> 4925.34
the original

4921.82 --> 4928.219
technical or technological based roots

4925.34 --> 4932.9800000000005
of the word hologram entirely

4928.219 --> 4932.9800000000005
so if I just call it an image of light

4934.36 --> 4939.82
that would actually kind of solve the

4937.52 --> 4939.820000000001
problem

4940.52 --> 4945.14
but then yeah as soon as you get kind of

4942.92 --> 4947.54
technical like how does it work the

4945.14 --> 4952.1
mechanics then I would probably resort

4947.54 --> 4954.0199999999995
to comparing it again to a hologram

4952.1 --> 4956.56
so

4954.02 --> 4956.56
weird

4965.659 --> 4969.8189999999995
um

4966.37 --> 4969.8189999999995
[Music]

4976.58 --> 4982.0599999999995
are not all images images of light

4983.9 --> 4989.299999999999
wow

4986.3 --> 4992.360000000001
I guess from an Optics perspective yeah

4989.3 --> 4993.9800000000005
Adam making hello

4992.36 --> 4997.12
right

4993.98 --> 5000.04
but in this case it would not be light

4997.12 --> 5002.98
reflecting of something

5000.04 --> 5005.98
that we see it would be literally the

5002.98 --> 5008.879999999999
light as it is manifesting without

5005.98 --> 5013.44
anything to reflect off

5008.88 --> 5013.4400000000005
directly presenting an image

5016.6 --> 5021.400000000001
so

5018.699 --> 5024.28
it's not just an image it is an image of

5021.4 --> 5026.679
light because it it's not just a

5024.28 --> 5030.58
reflecting image which is what typical

5026.679 --> 5032.28
images are reflecting of the light

to reach us

5032.28 --> 5035.87
[Music]

5035.92 --> 5040.8
they could possibly be Reflections no

5042.88 --> 5047.679
if they were Reflections then there

5044.92 --> 5050.7390000000005
would be traceable Natures to those

5047.679 --> 5055.54
reflective qualities and there aren't

5050.739 --> 5057.58
there would be hyper strong indication

5055.54 --> 5061.3
and there isn't

5057.58 --> 5065.0199999999995
right because a reflection means there

5061.3 --> 5068.14
has to be a traceable origin point

5065.02 --> 5070.92
and you would figure that out

5068.14 --> 5070.92
we haven't

5071.92 --> 5077.28
Nemo that's not a message you shouldn't

5074.56 --> 5077.280000000001

Kabbalah talk

5102.159 --> 5106.54
a thousand points of light is that what

5104.199 --> 5108.58
like Bush was referencing during like

5106.54 --> 5109.96
one of that speeches about the New World

5108.58 --> 5112.3
Order

5109.96 --> 5114.219
a thousand points of light was that was

5112.3 --> 5115.900000000001
he referencing the Kabbalah I didn't

5114.219 --> 5117.34
know that

5115.9 --> 5120.9
huh

5117.34 --> 5120.900000000001
learn something new every day

5121.719 --> 5125.14
right but that's not what I'm

5123.159 --> 5129.659
referencing at all

5125.14 --> 5129.659000000001
I'm he stole it yep duh

5131.98 --> 5138.82
well stole it I mean it just used it I

5137.44 --> 5143.699
mean stealing it I don't think there's

5138.82 --> 5143.699
any like legal possession on those words

5153.1 --> 5157.2390000000005
well sorry to hear that BJC net I really

5155.38 --> 5160.96

5157.239 --> 5164.0199999999995
beautiful weather day like this as well

5160.96 --> 5165.94

5164.02 --> 5168.120000000001
terrible rainy weather when it's like

5165.94 --> 5168.12

5203.8 --> 5209.46

I love being wrong

5218.199 --> 5223.36
about

5219.82 --> 5226.0
things when I don't really care about it

5223.36 --> 5229.239
when it like for example yeah when I'm

5226.0 --> 5231.76
Baldwin I'm technically wrong a lot

5229.239 --> 5233.138999999999
but it is within the the store it is

5231.76 --> 5234.820000000001
still within the structure so I'm not

5233.139 --> 5238.659000000001
wrong it's like

5234.82 --> 5241.5599999999995
you can be right about how about being

5238.659 --> 5241.5599999999995
wrong it's like

5242.199 --> 5249.159
yeah I hope you get it but in this case

5245.62 --> 5251.199
it was just a technical error and like

5249.159 --> 5255.82
that is

5251.199 --> 5258.159
like really painfully embarrassing to me

5255.82 --> 5260.62
when I'm like wrong about something that

5258.159 --> 5265.0599999999995
no matter from what perspective you look

5260.62 --> 5268.239
at it it's just wrong and I hate it when

5265.06 --> 5271.2390000000005
such things slip through I like I I feel

5268.239 --> 5273.82
felt sick I'm getting better now

5271.239 --> 5276.58
but now I just have to realize oh look

5273.82 --> 5277.62
oh look at this blemish blemish on all

5276.58 --> 5281.98
my work

5277.62 --> 5284.26
retroactive for four years oh goody

5281.98 --> 5288.099999999999
it's like having this painting and then

5284.26 --> 5291.900000000001
suddenly you realized a bird [Â __Â ] on it

5288.1 --> 5291.900000000001
that's that's what it feels like

5293.199 --> 5298.719
Baldwin is correct about presenting a

5295.48 --> 5300.04
representing anti-flat oh yeah oh yeah

5298.719 --> 5303.279

5313.12 --> 5318.5199999999995

5314.699 --> 5321.28
why don't you try to be a real person

5337.96 --> 5342.88

5341.5 --> 5345.28
kind of condone

5342.88 --> 5348.219
so yeah wrenches you can read that huh

5345.28 --> 5350.2
yeah

5348.219 --> 5351.4
I kind of agree with his this

5350.2 --> 5353.92
[Music]

5351.4 --> 5356.5599999999995
my followers clearly aren't smart enough

5353.92 --> 5361.1990000000005
to have picked up on the glaring error

5356.56 --> 5361.1990000000005
that I made yeah he's right about that

5361.719 --> 5364.5
yeah he is

5379.42 --> 5383.7390000000005
but I guess we live in a world where it

5381.88 --> 5386.38
just doesn't matter anymore if you're

5383.739 --> 5388.839999999999
technically incorrect about details

5386.38 --> 5390.82
as long as the big picture is okay and I

5388.84 --> 5394.96
know that my big picture overall is

5390.82 --> 5398.5
pretty solid yeah but guess what the

5394.96 --> 5401.88
details do matter

5398.5 --> 5401.88
they matter to me

5403.81 --> 5406.2390000000005
[Music]

5405.1 --> 5410.02
yeah

5406.239 --> 5412.718999999999
you can't build fractally

5410.02 --> 5415.1990000000005
if you're technically incorrect about

5412.719 --> 5415.199
things

5417.04 --> 5421.36
and has nothing to do with whether

5418.659 --> 5423.58
everybody agrees whether it is correct

5421.36 --> 5427.44
or not it is about whether it is

5423.58 --> 5427.44
actually correct or not yeah

5428.1 --> 5438.1
error breaks fractal application

5434.32 --> 5440.86
that's my why you need to avoid that at

5438.1 --> 5444.06
all cost if you want to have any kind of

5440.86 --> 5444.0599999999995
long-term impact

5445.42 --> 5451.39
have to be correct

5452.38 --> 5457.36
so yeah but I've learned my lesson from

5455.08 --> 5460.48
this I mean I've never gone through

5457.36 --> 5462.88
painful humiliation especially in public

5460.48 --> 5464.678999999999
because I do do it in public yeah I

5462.88 --> 5467.62
could have just said oh [Â __Â ] it I'm

5464.679 --> 5470.139
gonna ignore this thing and just move on

5467.62 --> 5472.719
just deal with it in private but no I

5470.139 --> 5474.9400000000005
chose to literally open the door and

5472.719 --> 5478.2390000000005
just look at me look at how [Â __Â ]

5474.94 --> 5481.178999999999
wrong I was you know I [Â __Â ] much I

5478.239 --> 5482.259999999999
hate it I hate it so much you cannot

5481.179 --> 5485.4400000000005
believe

5482.26 --> 5486.34
okay and I'm showing it I'm just showing

5485.44 --> 5488.62
it

5486.34 --> 5491.38
let's get it on with

5488.62 --> 5493.719
I was wrong I was really technically

5491.38 --> 5495.9400000000005
wrong and there's nothing I can do about

5493.719 --> 5499.2390000000005
it now

5495.94 --> 5501.48
except for not do that anymore and

5499.239 --> 5507.48
prevent that from ever happening again

5501.48 --> 5507.48
by never just going on a whim idea ever

5507.639 --> 5512.139
I'm not doing it anymore I'm not going

5509.739 --> 5513.28
on women Day ideas anymore

5512.139 --> 5517.0
done

5513.28 --> 5519.4
you people cannot handle it because when

5517.0 --> 5522.58
I go on a whim then I need people around

5519.4 --> 5524.739
me to immediately correct me if I'm

5522.58 --> 5527.58
technically Incorrect and you don't seem

5524.739 --> 5527.58
to be doing that

5528.1 --> 5534.219
so I guess I'll just have to refine it a

5531.52 --> 5537.52
little further before I can even lay

5534.219 --> 5540.82
down my ideas just like that I can't let

5537.52 --> 5544.320000000001
it happen spontaneous anymore because

5540.82 --> 5548.62
I'm not in a stable enough environment

5544.32 --> 5551.62
to prevent mistakes from settling in

5591.34 --> 5597.1
the celestials I think they're non-local

5593.86 --> 5598.719
Holograms right you know the riddle

5597.1 --> 5601.2390000000005
Adam right

5598.719 --> 5603.0
and yeah I'm still backing that there's

5601.239 --> 5605.5599999999995
nothing wrong about my description

5603.0 --> 5609.699
here's the thing

5605.56 --> 5615.46
I added on top of that as an argument

5609.699 --> 5618.099999999999
that the etymology of the word hologram

5615.46 --> 5620.56
meant image of light

5618.1 --> 5625.179
and I must have said it like a hundred

5620.56 --> 5628.1990000000005
times at least in the last four years

5625.179 --> 5628.1990000000005
and it isn't

5629.8 --> 5636.6
it isn't the etymology of the word it

5633.219 --> 5636.6
was completely off

5641.199 --> 5645.58
and it goes as far as that even in

5643.54 --> 5647.0199999999995
master B I'm chatting here with with

5645.58 --> 5649.3
John

5647.02 --> 5651.280000000001
refracted curvature he apparently told

5649.3 --> 5654.219
me at some point even debated me

5651.28 --> 5656.139
probably in the after show or after

5654.219 --> 5657.94
after show after the recording stopped

5656.139 --> 5660.82
for an hour about it

5657.94 --> 5664.678999999999
but then conceded

5660.82 --> 5664.679
he conceded to it

5664.96 --> 5671.76
to my incorrect assertion I cannot

5668.5 --> 5671.76
believe this is happening

5680.58 --> 5687.4
World Views yeah but that's different

5684.82 --> 5689.259999999999
I'm not talking about oh you disagree or

5687.4 --> 5691.659
oh you don't think it'll happen like

5689.26 --> 5692.9400000000005
that that has nothing to do with what

5691.659 --> 5696.94
we're talking about I'm talking about

5692.94 --> 5696.94
technical error

5697.199 --> 5706.78
technical like provable

5701.76 --> 5709.179
completely not speculative technical

5706.78 --> 5711.28
yeah if you're disagreeing with my

5709.179 --> 5713.56
speculations and you have alternative

5711.28 --> 5715.239
speculation yeah sure of course that

5713.56 --> 5717.6
happens a lot

5715.239 --> 5721.419999999999
especially if you're going to be

5717.6 --> 5723.159000000001
organically fed free-range Speculator so

5721.42 --> 5725.56
that's not what I'm talking about I'm

5723.159 --> 5729.36
talking about things that are just like

5725.56 --> 5729.360000000001
technically incorrect

5729.42 --> 5736.4800000000005
thank you do definitely keep an eye out

5733.12 --> 5738.94
on that absolutely absolutely do I

5736.48 --> 5741.959999999999

[Music]

5767.82 --> 5773.799999999999
that I now gotta etch out of my system

5771.239 --> 5776.379999999999
yeah so every time I might come up with

5773.8 --> 5779.4400000000005
like oh yeah yeah yeah hologram oh it's

5776.38 --> 5781.2390000000005
a hologram I mean it literally means the

5779.44 --> 5783.879999999999
etymology of the word now I have to

5781.239 --> 5786.4
literally like scratch that out of my

5783.88 --> 5789.159000000001
routines because I've been saying that

5786.4 --> 5791.379999999999
quite a lot now I have to actively every

5789.159 --> 5794.32
time I go into that I have to like

5791.38 --> 5797.400000000001
scratch it out

5794.32 --> 5797.4
it sucks

5804.88 --> 5809.1990000000005
my grandma's invented in the 40s what

5807.46 --> 5811.56
did what do you mean it doesn't mean

5809.199 --> 5811.5599999999995
anything

5814.42 --> 5818.679
that makes no sense domenoid doesn't

5816.82 --> 5822.299999999999
matter when a word is invented it could

5818.679 --> 5822.3
be literally invented yesterday

5822.54 --> 5829.179
if the word is assembled

5825.82 --> 5833.08
right from other words

5829.179 --> 5835.0
especially old words like Greek

5833.08 --> 5837.639
right or Latin

5835.0 --> 5839.86
that's etymology I mean that's literally

5837.639 --> 5841.900000000001
where the words are taken from to create

5839.86 --> 5846.0599999999995
the new word I mean

5841.9 --> 5846.0599999999995
doesn't matter when it was invented

5850.06 --> 5856.06
so ask the guy who invented it why he

5853.48 --> 5858.58
named it hologram well there's a thing

5856.06 --> 5859.659000000001
right why did he name it that I don't

5858.58 --> 5862.96
know

5859.659 --> 5866.799999999999
he thought it was a good idea

5862.96 --> 5869.139
whole image or whole line okay he

5866.8 --> 5872.62
thought that it was apparently

5869.139 --> 5875.02
a worthy thing to name it but that's not

5872.62 --> 5878.32
the point why he named it that the point

5875.02 --> 5880.42
is is that the etymology of it means

5878.32 --> 5882.78
what it means and it doesn't mean image

5880.42 --> 5882.78
and Light

5954.94 --> 5959.5599999999995

5957.58 --> 5963.28
the title I mean it's been literally the

5959.56 --> 5965.9400000000005
whole show I'm just whining about this

5963.28 --> 5965.94
foreign

5966.58 --> 5971.32
but yeah it's because I really care

5970.06 --> 5972.55
I'm sorry

5971.32 --> 5975.759999999999
I do

5972.55 --> 5978.820000000001
[Music]

5975.76 --> 5981.219
and my error is like a really sloppy

5978.82 --> 5983.5
error I have to admit I I used to make

5981.219 --> 5985.96
errors like this quite a lot when I was

5983.5 --> 5989.199
a lot younger doesn't mean that my ideas

5985.96 --> 5991.84
were wrong it's just that I got sloppy

5989.199 --> 5994.839999999999
with words because there's so much of

5991.84 --> 5997.719
them and I had to like gift at some

5994.84 --> 5999.900000000001
point realize like yeah it's you need to

5997.719 --> 6003.2390000000005
use more words that you can actually

5999.9 --> 6005.58
properly learn about when you're young

6003.239 --> 6007.638999999999
so this sort of [Â __Â ] happened a lot back

6005.58 --> 6010.98
then

6007.639 --> 6014.9400000000005
and it was quite

6010.98 --> 6018.0599999999995
a hard discipline to kind of get me to

6014.94 --> 6019.0199999999995
really pay attention to language so this

6018.06 --> 6022.38
error

6019.02 --> 6025.5
is like a throwback to like my early

6022.38 --> 6029.219
teens it's really [Â __Â ] embarrassing

6025.5 --> 6032.28
that at 42 I'm now facing an error like

6029.219 --> 6035.52
that I'm really embarrassed

6032.28 --> 6038.54
I'm gonna make sure it never ever

6035.52 --> 6038.540000000001
happens again

6043.04 --> 6046.489
[Music]

6047.78 --> 6054.42
what multiple meaning sure

6051.12 --> 6056.34
tensor thank you for the car I that's

6054.42 --> 6061.04
actually a really nice

6056.34 --> 6061.04
comment I appreciate that then sir

6062.46 --> 6069.96
but my point is is that

6065.28 --> 6072.12
not whether hologram even is a a proper

6069.96 --> 6076.199
designation

6072.12 --> 6078.12
or a title for this unique phenomenon of

6076.199 --> 6080.4
the non-local holographic celestials

6078.12 --> 6083.639
right it's not about that it's about

6080.4 --> 6086.099999999999
that I kept saying that it means image

6083.639 --> 6088.1990000000005
of light through etymology and it just

6086.1 --> 6090.84
doesn't it doesn't matter

6088.199 --> 6093.0599999999995
if it's a multiple meaning word the

6090.84 --> 6095.34
etymology simply is not image of light

6093.06 --> 6097.38
so I was technically Incorrect and

6095.34 --> 6099.06
there's nothing that can be done to

6097.38 --> 6102.96
alter that

6099.06 --> 6104.820000000001
I can only be cut off and ensure that

6102.96 --> 6108.139
it'll never happen again that's the only

6104.82 --> 6108.139
thing I can do about it

6108.54 --> 6111.54
ah

6112.38 --> 6118.52
what I really do appreciate that that

6114.78 --> 6118.5199999999995
comment tensor that's awesome

6120.619 --> 6126.0199999999995
I'm kind of inclined to just give you a

6123.179 --> 6128.6990000000005
wrench just for that one comment

6126.02 --> 6132.56
if you want it I don't know I've never

6128.699 --> 6132.5599999999995
seen you before here so

6141.719 --> 6143.78
um

6149.28 --> 6153.86
what did I miss a lot

6154.38 --> 6158.3
mostly silent all right

6158.82 --> 6161.759999999999
I'm gonna give you a wrench for

6160.44 --> 6163.619
identification

6161.76 --> 6165.54
then

6163.619 --> 6168.839999999999
you know the rules concerning wrenches

6165.54 --> 6171.3
but just to make sure because yeah you

6168.84 --> 6174.56
I really liked what you said there

6171.3 --> 6174.56
was a quality post

6175.199 --> 6177.919999999999
foreign

6186.5 --> 6190.98
matter that much about the etymology

6189.6 --> 6192.54
yeah

6190.98 --> 6195.659
yeah because it was technically

6192.54 --> 6197.699
Incorrect and there's nothing I can do

6195.659 --> 6200.759999999999
to

6197.699 --> 6202.86
alter it or bend it or anything to to

6200.76 --> 6204.780000000001
occur to justify it it was just

6202.86 --> 6206.88
technically Incorrect and it kept

6204.78 --> 6211.28
repeating it over and over and over

6206.88 --> 6211.28
again and it yeah it matters

6214.38 --> 6219.719
and this is not about the argument of

6217.08 --> 6221.82
the nature of the sun and the celestials

6219.719 --> 6224.76
it's not even about that right because

6221.82 --> 6226.799999999999
that is yeah that's open for debate and

6224.76 --> 6228.42
speculation and there's still more

6226.8 --> 6230.219
information that a lot of people would

6228.42 --> 6232.56
want

6230.219 --> 6235.619
in order to figure it out right so

6232.56 --> 6238.7390000000005
that's an ongoing thing my embarrassment

6235.619 --> 6240.839999999999
is not about that I'm very solid in my

6238.739 --> 6242.759999999999
point

6240.84 --> 6245.58
concerning the celestials and their

6242.76 --> 6249.42
nature the problem is is that I was

6245.58 --> 6251.46
technically incorrect when I set the

6249.42 --> 6252.3
etymology of hologram meant image of

6251.46 --> 6255.36
light

6252.3 --> 6257.88
and in all that time I was so confident

6255.36 --> 6260.339999999999
about it I never even looked it up I

6257.88 --> 6263.36
cannot believe

6260.34 --> 6263.360000000001
that this happened

6266.89 --> 6270.049

6278.699 --> 6281.699
what

6279.86 --> 6284.599999999999
[Music]

6281.699 --> 6284.599999999999
okay

6286.92 --> 6289.9400000000005
what does that mean

6297.659 --> 6303.0
thermal type are you saying that like

6300.06 --> 6304.8
the the Rocket Fuel and support what

6303.0 --> 6307.34
they're supposedly using basically it

6304.8 --> 6307.34
isn't that

6307.619 --> 6313.44
are you saying that if it were actually

6309.719 --> 6317.52
as they said it would be that the fuel

6313.44 --> 6319.919999999999
would be too hot for the rocket to even

6317.52 --> 6322.26
yeah remain

6319.92 --> 6323.88
the retain its structure Integrity is

6322.26 --> 6326.820000000001
that what you're saying

6323.88 --> 6329.78
go broken no that's [Â __Â ] no you're a

6326.82 --> 6329.78
troll get the [Â __Â ] up

yeah [Â __Â ] off with your delusion dude

6345.179 --> 6349.26

6347.58 --> 6351.0
insertions

6349.26 --> 6352.619000000001
I mean I thought you actually had

6351.0 --> 6355.739
something technical there but you're

6352.619 --> 6358.0199999999995
just a troll ridiculous idiot

6355.739 --> 6360.48
yeah we're not gonna fall for [Â __Â ]

6358.02 --> 6364.159000000001
like rockets don't go up it's a hologram

6360.48 --> 6364.159
you can go [Â __Â ] yourself yeah

6365.57 --> 6369.599999999999
[Music]

6367.38 --> 6371.58
it's not what's going on with rockets at

6369.6 --> 6374.04
all

6371.58 --> 6377.4
right there's another game at Play

6374.04 --> 6379.699
they're not Holograms but Rockets more

6377.4 --> 6384.36
likely are are actually

6379.699 --> 6387.419999999999
rocket powered helium balloons

6384.36 --> 6389.58
they don't have all that real weight

6387.42 --> 6391.5
they have counterweight

6389.58 --> 6393.719
that means that they can be much more

6391.5 --> 6395.34
efficient with actual fuel

6393.719 --> 6396.42
because it doesn't really have to go

6395.34 --> 6400.46
anywhere

6396.42 --> 6400.46
so it's like a rocket-powered balloon

6401.46 --> 6406.219
not a hologram

6403.139 --> 6406.219
that's ridiculous

6406.5 --> 6417.08
I mean they might use CGI simulations of

6411.6 --> 6417.08
it in their video presentation right

6417.659 --> 6422.699
and they might even like not ever even

6420.719 --> 6424.44
have a rocket they yeah they could just

6422.699 --> 6425.699
say like oh this is on the price we're

6424.44 --> 6428.719
gonna launch this rocket we're gonna

6425.699 --> 6431.759999999999
build it and launch it on this private

6428.719 --> 6433.7390000000005
area it is not for open public to see

6431.76 --> 6436.56
the launch right and then they can just

6433.739 --> 6438.599999999999
literally all do a CGI never even having

6436.56 --> 6442.38
to make anything physical

6438.6 --> 6445.1
that can happen might happen

6442.38 --> 6447.659000000001
but when there's actual supposed

6445.1 --> 6450.8
life or public View

6447.659 --> 6454.98
rocket launches those are not Holograms

6450.8 --> 6457.02
those are actual physical things

6454.98 --> 6461.339999999999
but they're not

6457.02 --> 6463.080000000001
how they claim to be designed

6461.34 --> 6467.28
they're more like rocket-powered

6463.08 --> 6470.1
balloons which is much more efficient

6467.28 --> 6472.0199999999995
I mean it doesn't have a lot of huge

6470.1 --> 6475.02
amount of weight saves a lot of Rocket

6472.02 --> 6476.639
Fuel and then you can just save all the

6475.02 --> 6478.679
costs for the theatrics I mean you could

6476.639 --> 6480.54
still have just a giant flame coming out

6478.679 --> 6482.159
of it it will be loud it will be

6480.54 --> 6483.78
spectacular

6482.159 --> 6486.719
but it

6483.78 --> 6488.94
yeah that's all they need it's all first

6486.719 --> 6491.1
stage performance that's how they

6488.94 --> 6494.178999999999
designed these things as a stage

6491.1 --> 6494.179
Performance Tool

6502.679 --> 6507.78
okay Leia sure

6506.1 --> 6509.88

6758.58 --> 6762.78
trajectory it takes it comes up in the

6761.159 --> 6765.179
East and goes down in the west and it's

6762.78 --> 6769.199
the same everywhere

6765.179 --> 6771.7390000000005
yeah it's not the other way around in

6769.199 --> 6771.739
Australia

6786.78 --> 6795.86
is it is that the topic really is it

6791.76 --> 6795.860000000001
why just because you brought it up

6805.619 --> 6810.299999999999
no no I don't think so I don't need to

6808.44 --> 6813.78
go there it's kind of

6810.3 --> 6814.95

how the F that doesn't there's no

6831.42 --> 6835.679
difference it's no difference on the

6833.46 --> 6837.9
globe it's just really really dumb

6835.679 --> 6840.719
people that don't get this

6837.9 --> 6843.0
it's the same everything is the same

6840.719 --> 6846.56
on a globe on a flat Earth it doesn't

6843.0 --> 6846.56
matter the stars are the same

6848.46 --> 6852.5
go up in the east go down in the West

6852.96 --> 6857.1
on the globe they would come up in the

6855.239 --> 6859.5599999999995
East and go down in the west because the

6857.1 --> 6862.8
Earth is assumed to be spinning in

6859.56 --> 6866.34
between it instead it still effectively

6862.8 --> 6868.38
works the same mechanically

6866.34 --> 6870.26
not of course that the Earth is spinning

6868.38 --> 6873.3
because it isn't

6870.26 --> 6877.38
we would see coriolis deviation if it

6873.3 --> 6880.9400000000005
were just like heliocentrism claims Neil

6881.1 --> 6888.1990000000005

prove that the Earth is flat and not a

6966.119 --> 6969.9
globe

6966.96 --> 6971.76
star trails are not one of them

6969.9 --> 6973.379999999999
they don't prove it's a globe they don't

6971.76 --> 6975.54
prove it's the Earth is flat they don't

6973.38 --> 6979.159000000001
