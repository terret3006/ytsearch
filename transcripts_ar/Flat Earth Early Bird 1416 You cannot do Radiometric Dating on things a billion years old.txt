more clouded but yeah and then it sort

127.92 --> 133.459

130.56 --> 137.28
a lot of planes trailing

173.3 --> 176.489
[Music]

192.06 --> 195.379
all right so

196.26 --> 203.22
hello that flat fellow first in chat

198.78 --> 206.28
jado terre306 good to see you

203.22 --> 210.08
what's the temperature not sure it's

206.28 --> 210.08
still kind of cold I think

212.4 --> 218.9
15 degrees Celsius okay so yeah pretty

216.3 --> 218.9
much the same

219.659 --> 227.06
from the what the forecast says it's

223.14 --> 227.05999999999997
gonna be kind of staying like that

227.34 --> 232.86
up until

229.799 --> 235.4
well next week but we'll see if that

232.86 --> 235.4
actually happens

238.319 --> 244.01899999999998
30 degrees Celsius oh okay well it's

241.5 --> 246.56
India so yeah

244.019 --> 246.56
anyway

248.36 --> 252.31900000000002
oh are you all doing

253.5 --> 258.199
uh

255.78 --> 260.76
doing okay not as cranky as yesterday

258.199 --> 263.0
because God I was really cranky

260.76 --> 263.0
yesterday

263.4 --> 269.09999999999997
well I did actually at least recognize

265.68 --> 271.259
it before the show uh or yeah as the

269.1 --> 274.74
show started but yeah that turned out to

271.259 --> 277.56
be correct and even got a bit pissed off

274.74 --> 279.419
with the guys after the after show was

277.56 --> 282.02
rounded out because they kept pushing

279.419 --> 282.02
about something

282.74 --> 289.08
so I don't know it's uh maybe it's the

286.919 --> 292.139
it's a bit of season of Rage win or

289.08 --> 294.06
something I'm I'm not like

292.139 --> 297.36
looking for that or anything just for

294.06 --> 297.36
the record uh

305.88 --> 313.02
24 is difficult okay so it's like a

308.94 --> 315.62
little more warm than usual okay

313.02 --> 315.62
hmm

317.1 --> 324.62
anyway man this night was so restless

320.06 --> 324.62
and I stayed up way too late

324.96 --> 328.85999999999996
and it's because the freaking wind just

327.06 --> 331.38
kept blowing and blowing and blowing

328.86 --> 333.66
like the entire night and it was like

331.38 --> 337.46
cold

333.66 --> 337.46000000000004
and I just couldn't

337.56 --> 342.539
it couldn't switch

339.6 --> 345.84000000000003
to like hey I should go to bed really

342.539 --> 348.5
annoying in retrospect but

345.84 --> 348.5
yeah

348.72 --> 355.44000000000005
but I still managed to rest pretty well

351.419 --> 357.24
and yeah just slept a little extra

355.44 --> 359.71999999999997
but yeah it's part of the reason why I'm

357.24 --> 359.72
a little late

374.4 --> 388.64
huh it's India one week winter okay

380.49 --> 388.64
[Music]

392.699 --> 398.22
anyway

394.62 --> 401.16
still have an Illuminati Casa remnant

398.22 --> 403.02000000000004
well most of it

401.16 --> 405.18
taking it slow

403.02 --> 406.62
uh right so yeah anyway

405.18 --> 411.02
[Music]

406.62 --> 411.02
yes there's flatters debate was great

412.16 --> 415.819
it's just fine

417.6 --> 423.66
even though yeah I was not present with

419.639 --> 427.68
most of the live show just at the start

423.66 --> 430.139
then it went out for groceries and yeah

427.68 --> 432.96
I mean with a lot of wind and stuff it

430.139 --> 436.08
takes just longer on my freaking bike

432.96 --> 438.919
and the bike is kind of getting old and

436.08 --> 443.28
uh

438.919 --> 445.44
let's call that it's it's not as fluid

443.28 --> 447.35999999999996
and loose as it used to be it's a very

445.44 --> 449.16
old bike by now and

447.36 --> 451.62
whatever

449.16 --> 453.90000000000003
but yeah it all takes longer a

451.62 --> 457.62
geoshifter illuminati castle Yeah

453.9 --> 459.65999999999997
Illuminati because I mean I've been

457.62 --> 460.74
showing that and calling that since the

459.66 --> 463.56
very

460.74 --> 465.81
first few Early Bird shows

463.56 --> 472.22
shouldn't be new to you

465.81 --> 472.22
[Music]

473.22 --> 478.58000000000004
um

474.419 --> 478.58
you missed that really

485.759 --> 491.22
okay or maybe you just forgot

488.98 --> 494.22
[Music]

491.22 --> 496.86
I think I like ate like at least a

494.22 --> 499.58000000000004
hundred of those over the years

496.86 --> 499.58000000000004
on screen

500.16 --> 503.24
right anyway

505.319 --> 510.06
what's going on out there

507.84 --> 513.4399999999999
anything interesting that I might not

510.06 --> 513.44
have caught up with

522.899 --> 528.839
I'm still yeah I keep by the way I keep

525.66 --> 530.6999999999999
just watching these Hugo talks videos

528.839 --> 532.5
I'm liking them I'm liking them

530.7 --> 535.74
especially because he kind of keeps them

532.5 --> 539.54
short but not like super super short but

535.74 --> 539.54
just short one item

540.0 --> 543.8
I'm just enjoying his shows

545.04 --> 550.0999999999999
so whoever originally recommended me

547.98 --> 551.82
that channel thank you

550.1 --> 554.82
[Music]

551.82 --> 554.82
uh

573.68 --> 579.899
David ick was banned from going to the

576.06 --> 581.2199999999999
Netherlands yeah and the rest of Europe

579.899 --> 582.779
I know

581.22 --> 584.76
absurd

582.779 --> 587.72
and there is some backlash in the

584.76 --> 587.72
Netherlands about it

591.6 --> 598.9200000000001
there's look the news is like really or

594.6 --> 602.12
the alternative news it's still news

598.92 --> 602.12
but like the whole

603.74 --> 607.86
resistance movement can you can call it

606.06 --> 610.26
that the opposition

607.86 --> 612.779
is really like

610.26 --> 614.64
move after move and it seems like all

612.779 --> 617.64
these

614.64 --> 617.64
ministers

618.0 --> 623.399
and their crimes

620.16 --> 626.399
during the supposed Corona times

623.399 --> 629.459
are just coming more and more out and

626.399 --> 632.399
being put on the table and

629.459 --> 635.64
I'm very curious to see where this goes

632.399 --> 638.22
if it'll actually amount to anything

635.64 --> 641.3389999999999
have been for a while but at least now

638.22 --> 644.519
it's being put there

641.339 --> 646.5600000000001
right when that's been kind of not

644.519 --> 647.88
happening for a long time

646.56 --> 651.4799999999999
so

647.88 --> 653.399
I mean this prime minister we have and

651.48 --> 656.7
his cabinet and his people have been

653.399 --> 657.839
like in the in the Thrones not in the

656.7 --> 659.4590000000001
throne

657.839 --> 660.899
in power

659.459 --> 665.4799999999999
for

660.899 --> 665.48
like over a decade by now

667.38 --> 671.42
like this is his third cabinet

672.32 --> 679.2800000000001
and yeah

675.12 --> 681.24
I mean people are utterly sick of it

679.28 --> 683.9399999999999
[Music]

681.24 --> 684.779
but it seems also that there's just a

683.94 --> 687.9590000000001
lot of

684.779 --> 689.16
vested money interest

687.959 --> 692.279
like

689.16 --> 693.54
backing that party specifically so it's

692.279 --> 695.459
like

693.54 --> 697.8
they're not really a party for the

695.459 --> 702.2399999999999
people their party for

697.8 --> 706.56
a bunch of rich people that are doing

702.24 --> 709.38
like schemes using this party it's like

706.56 --> 713.04
inherently corrupted and that's kind of

709.38 --> 713.04
been already suspected

713.82 --> 719.7
for a long time

715.98 --> 722.16
but just the sheer amount in of ways in

719.7 --> 723.839
which it turns out they were corrupted

722.16 --> 727.519
all of them

723.839 --> 727.519
is mind-boggling

730.44 --> 734.4590000000001
and it's getting put on the table so

732.959 --> 738.7399999999999
yeah

734.459 --> 738.7399999999999
I really hope it amounts to something

742.14 --> 749.22
Beyond just kicking them out that is

746.16 --> 753.48
because yeah I mean these people when

749.22 --> 756.6
they get fired they don't give a [ __ ]

753.48 --> 760.62
they immediately get some super high

756.6 --> 762.72
overpaid position outside the government

760.62 --> 765.42
and

762.72 --> 767.519
nothing usually happens like exactly

765.42 --> 770.76
like for example what infamously

767.519 --> 773.16
happened to Tony Blair right

770.76 --> 776.279
when he was like together with bush one

773.16 --> 780.18
of the primaries that were basically

776.279 --> 782.279
creating all the Iraq Havoc Etc

780.18 --> 785.519
horrible things

782.279 --> 787.74
against the will of the people etc etc

785.519 --> 791.4590000000001
censorship

787.74 --> 794.04
and yeah and we got kicked out and he

791.459 --> 796.5
just got a very high paying job and

794.04 --> 798.8
nobody's doing anything about it about

796.5 --> 798.8
him

799.74 --> 804.26
right that's kind of what these guys

801.959 --> 804.26
want

806.339 --> 812.7890000000001
anyway

807.11 --> 812.789
[Music]

815.639 --> 821.639
hello Mike sidonic

818.1 --> 823.74
do we live tonight I don't know

821.639 --> 832.25
probably damn it

823.74 --> 832.25
[Music]

836.7 --> 842.1600000000001
who is Mark from the Hunts I don't know

839.339 --> 844.8800000000001
geoshifter

842.16 --> 844.88
foreign

851.21 --> 854.399
[Music]

863.1 --> 866.72
anyway

864.23 --> 869.94
[Music]

866.72 --> 872.76
so yeah I'm kind of staring at that

869.94 --> 875.9590000000001
[Music]

872.76 --> 875.959
oh that is rolling out

876.0 --> 879.0
foreign

879.93 --> 885.1289999999999
[Music]

887.42 --> 893.699
you must not watched much TV no I don't

890.519 --> 896.88
watch any TV geoshifter

893.699 --> 900.8389999999999
I mean you could pretty much summarize

896.88 --> 903.36
yeah sum up the amount of time that I

900.839 --> 907.639
watched Dutch television to be

903.36 --> 907.639
like half an hour this entire year

907.86 --> 915.6
like I just never watch it unless like

911.699 --> 917.279
I'm like weird bored I need to like do

915.6 --> 918.72
something completely different and then

917.279 --> 921.959
I might like browse through it and it's

918.72 --> 925.32
like oh there's this classical music

921.959 --> 927.959
concert playing well then I'll click on

925.32 --> 931.1990000000001
that maybe if it and then as soon as it

927.959 --> 933.5999999999999
they do something really disgusting in

931.199 --> 935.579
between that to be all modern and woke

933.6 --> 937.74
then I just immediately [ __ ] this get

935.579 --> 941.18
out and that's how it pretty much

937.74 --> 945.42
amounts to a total of

941.18 --> 949.3299999999999
20 minutes an hour

945.42 --> 952.389
I don't watch anything else so

949.33 --> 952.389
[Music]

953.339 --> 959.82
so I have absolutely no idea I it's like

956.94 --> 962.339
even there's all this hype going around

959.82 --> 963.899
about this special television news

962.339 --> 966.4200000000001
program

963.899 --> 969.24
that is like oppositional that doesn't

966.42 --> 971.88
go with the [ __ ]

969.24 --> 975.36
and it's like getting all bombarded but

971.88 --> 978.18
I've literally even never seen that

975.36 --> 981.38
but they're all so outraged because it's

978.18 --> 981.38
supposedly on television

981.48 --> 986.339
never seen it

983.82 --> 990.24
keep hearing about it

986.339 --> 992.82
get keep getting like a Twitter

990.24 --> 995.3
two-minute clips and [ __ ] from that and

992.82 --> 995.3000000000001
that's it

997.199 --> 999.56

1037.459 --> 1041.26

one of these articles

1044.419 --> 1046.8390000000002
let's see

1118.4 --> 1122.96
about now what is going wrong now oh no

1121.22 --> 1125.66
why does the world come no I would

1122.96 --> 1129.74
literally just never

1125.66 --> 1133.64
watch any kind of thing ever

1129.74 --> 1137.299
any speech from anybody about it I just

1133.64 --> 1139.94
did not listen to it I refuse

1137.299 --> 1142.039
dude I could barely even stand listening

1139.94 --> 1144.0800000000002
to some of the [ __ ] that came out of

1142.039 --> 1146.24
like the Alex Jones Show because of

1144.08 --> 1148.6999999999998
their enormous focus on that nonsense

1146.24 --> 1150.799
and always assuming the virus is real

1148.7 --> 1152.27
even though they're still now

1150.799 --> 1153.98
for a while have that

always like wearing black now too and

1160.1 --> 1166.6
she is like full on

1162.44 --> 1169.4
saying like yeah terrain Theory uh

1166.6 --> 1171.3999999999999
viruses don't exist

1169.4 --> 1174.26
that's also

1171.4 --> 1176.48
still in between there's like a weekly

1174.26 --> 1178.64
segment or something where sometimes she

1176.48 --> 1180.679
comes in and just does that

1178.64 --> 1182.6200000000001
keep forgetting name

1180.679 --> 1185.72
and they don't exactly like post

1182.62 --> 1187.039
articles back about it it's like oh she

1185.72 --> 1189.02
did a video again

1187.039 --> 1192.02
I think that the rest of like the whole

1189.02 --> 1195.02
tea crew doesn't really appreciate it

1192.02 --> 1197.9
all that much that she's basically just

1195.02 --> 1201.039
breaking that spell

1197.9 --> 1201.039
just like that

1202.1 --> 1208.6999999999998
but she is to be fair one of the few

1206.48 --> 1212.6
people that

1208.7 --> 1215.419
when she comes on I am like oh hey oh

actually like informed actually informed

that's what they secretly want to do

they want to turn this virus [ __ ] into

the next level Globe [ __ ] like

it's about as useful as knowing

like the material content of the surface

1426.74 --> 1433.82
of Mars or Venus I mean there's people

that know everything about what it's

1433.82 --> 1440.78
supposed to be there based on

the composition of like the sand dust

1470.419 --> 1473.919
useful is that information

1475.039 --> 1479.0
right

1476.539 --> 1480.26
and yeah sled earthers you already know

like

1480.26 --> 1485.48
it doesn't actually exist now

1483.38 --> 1488.14
when you understand it doesn't actually

1485.48 --> 1491.179
exist never will exist then how

1488.14 --> 1492.6200000000001
unbelievably [ __ ] useless is that

1491.179 --> 1495.5800000000002

you mean Professor dude the solar system

1619.159 --> 1625.5800000000002
is one thing but history

1621.86 --> 1629.059
what history of the solar system

1625.58 --> 1631.279
how did you establish a history

1629.059 --> 1633.6789999999999
all that story is

1631.279 --> 1634.82
of how the solar system supposedly came

1633.679 --> 1637.94
to be

1634.82 --> 1640.7
is not historical it's all speculative

1637.94 --> 1643.94
Phil Bill don't you know that

1640.7 --> 1646.1000000000001
that they don't actually have like

1643.94 --> 1649.7
historical proofread

1646.1 --> 1652.12
there was nobody there to write about it

1649.7 --> 1652.1200000000001
yeah

1652.22 --> 1658.039
and yeah they can take samples and then

1655.22 --> 1660.44
have ideas about like oh why is that oh

1658.039 --> 1661.94
they're if it's this supposed material

1660.44 --> 1664.3400000000001
then it would have

1661.94 --> 1667.4
taken this long under these conditions

1664.34 --> 1671.299
and then you can sort of very sloppily

1667.4 --> 1672.38
try to back engineer something

1671.299 --> 1675.559
but

1672.38 --> 1679.1000000000001
none of that actually amounts to like a

1675.559 --> 1681.44
history of how it really formed because

1679.1 --> 1685.3999999999999
nobody knows

1681.44 --> 1687.5
assuming that they believe it's real

1685.4 --> 1690.3200000000002
yeah

1687.5 --> 1693.7
it's not history it's literally a

1690.32 --> 1693.7
speculative story

1695.02 --> 1699.2
we know based on everything oh really

1697.34 --> 1701.539
what is the evidence what is the

1699.2 --> 1705.4
evidence for the formation of the solar

1701.539 --> 1705.4

1712.46 --> 1719.799
any more other any other Trope loose end

1716.059 --> 1719.799
questions you got for us

1731.6 --> 1736.36
what is the evidence Professor Phil bill

1736.58 --> 1741.98
evidence

1737.96 --> 1744.559
for a history of the solar system let's

1741.98 --> 1748.0
go you're a teacher right you've been

1744.559 --> 1748.0
doing this your half your life

1750.08 --> 1755.72
or is this the extent of your teaching

1753.62 --> 1757.3999999999999
yeah when people inquire hey how does

1755.72 --> 1760.52
that work what is this how did you get

1757.4 --> 1762.38
that where how do you know this we know

1760.52 --> 1764.84
based on evidence

1762.38 --> 1767.96
does that work usually when you say that

1764.84 --> 1769.4599999999998
do your students then like oh okay so he

1767.96 --> 1772.64
doesn't know

1769.46 --> 1776.48
do they know that about you

1772.64 --> 1779.48
or are they so incredibly timid and

1776.48 --> 1782.38
weakened that they actually settle for

Professor Phil

1804.14 --> 1814.48
Are You Are you seriously safe

1808.159 --> 1814.48
that you can determine the age of a rock

1822.74 --> 1827.96
how it is this how you go about

1825.44 --> 1831.02
Professor philbel you just scattered

1827.96 --> 1834.2
getting your students with more stupid

1831.02 --> 1837.44
loose and open assertions is that how

1834.2 --> 1840.799
you do it you just extinguish their

1837.44 --> 1843.26
curiosity by asking even more stupid

1840.799 --> 1844.6399999999999
questions on top of the previous stupid

1843.26 --> 1848.02
questions

1844.64 --> 1848.0200000000002
is that how you do it

1849.919 --> 1857.24
I mean not questions stupid answers

1854.36 --> 1859.399
sorry about that I mean

1857.24 --> 1862.039
you better care okay how do you do it

1859.399 --> 1864.86
then yeah why don't you summarize it for

1862.039 --> 1866.56

1918.02 --> 1922.8799999999999
that there's little chunks of carbon in

okay

1925.58 --> 1931.24
yeah you know what the thing about it

1928.1 --> 1935.25
though that entire system is is that

1931.24 --> 1937.0
radiometric dating is incredibly

1935.25 --> 1941.6

1937.0 --> 1944.299

1944.299 --> 1946.539
right

1947.299 --> 1952.22
I mean

1948.98 --> 1954.74
how the [ __ ] not Carpenter oh yeah yeah

1952.22 --> 1956.44
yeah yeah why don't you [ __ ] Wiki it

1954.74 --> 1958.7
I just did

1956.44 --> 1961.539
specifically mentioning

1958.7 --> 1961.539
yeah yeah

1963.62 --> 1969.52
date materials such as rock and carbon

1967.22 --> 1972.5
in which Trace

1969.52 --> 1975.1399999999999
radioactive impurities

1972.5 --> 1978.799
are right

1975.14 --> 1981.0200000000002
that's that's radio metric dating that's

1978.799 --> 1982.82
like the radioactivity is the same thing

1981.02 --> 1984.98
as with carbon dating that's why it's

1982.82 --> 1988.899
mentioned in there yeah

1984.98 --> 1992.8990000000001
so this has been admitted to be

1988.899 --> 1992.899
incredibly unreliable

1993.799 --> 2000.94
yeah where literally traceable things

1998.899 --> 2003.6399999999999
have been dated

2000.94 --> 2006.179
whereas there's a historical record when

2003.64 --> 2009.88
they were like with the actual

2006.179 --> 2012.519
radiometric dating that they were off by

2009.88 --> 2015.94
like a thousand years

2012.519 --> 2017.14
like a factor of 10.

2015.94 --> 2021.48
yeah

2017.14 --> 2024.8200000000002
it's incredibly unreliable

2021.48 --> 2026.799
especially on the long run now when

2024.82 --> 2029.6789999999999
you're dealing with oh did you forget

2026.799 --> 2031.779

with like the last Thousand Years Phil

kind of smothered

3698.94 --> 3702.66
a steam Traveler

3700.74 --> 3704.8799999999997
what's the topic for today I don't know

3702.66 --> 3706.799
I didn't really have a topic but I just

3704.88 --> 3709.6800000000003
had a uh

3706.799 --> 3712.559
issue with Phil Bell kicked him out

3709.68 --> 3715.0789999999997
because he he just kept at it asserting

3712.559 --> 3717.5400000000004
something that's

3715.079 --> 3720.6600000000003
just unbelievably stupid

3717.54 --> 3722.599
and he never backed down

3720.66 --> 3725.64
just just

3722.599 --> 3727.28
intolerable and I got a little pissed

3725.64 --> 3731.24
off over it so

3727.28 --> 3731.2400000000002
yeah you missed that part

3740.94 --> 3743.48
what's up

3763.28 --> 3768.079
right other than that I don't really

3765.359 --> 3768.0789999999997
have a topic

3769.26 --> 3774.7200000000003
I just know that this evening I'm gonna

3772.44 --> 3775.7400000000002
make sure not to go to bed late like

3774.72 --> 3778.02
this

3775.74 --> 3779.3999999999996
probably when I'm more rested I'll

3778.02 --> 3782.22
probably

3779.4 --> 3784.4
be more inspired and less agitated as

3782.22 --> 3784.3999999999996
well

3806.16 --> 3811.0789999999997
but

3808.319 --> 3813.619
type one that's either where

3811.079 --> 3813.619
what

3834.54 --> 3838.9
all right that's just the way it said I

3838.02 --> 3842.7599999999998
get it

3838.9 --> 3842.76
[Music]

3843.0 --> 3847.28
yeah the off right

3848.16 --> 3854.339
[Music]

3851.16 --> 3857.66
it's not really a typo then it's just a

3854.339 --> 3857.66
grammar or a

3857.88 --> 3863.61
sentence construction issue

3861.72 --> 3872.4689999999996
all right I got it

3863.61 --> 3872.469
[Music]

3872.94 --> 3880.46
how do we feel about the convict amnesty

3877.559 --> 3880.46
pedophile

3880.799 --> 3884.119
and not gonna work

3884.339 --> 3888.96
I mean there will be plenty of people

3886.2 --> 3890.339
that probably are themselves vaccine

3888.96 --> 3892.559
damaged

3890.339 --> 3893.5789999999997
that will be very like oh yeah I forget

3892.559 --> 3895.92
it

3893.579 --> 3897.78
because they're just weak

3895.92 --> 3898.92
but there's gonna be a whole bunch of

3897.78 --> 3901.079
people

3898.92 --> 3903.66
that might have not even taken it that

3901.079 --> 3906.2400000000002
are not gonna forgive it as they noticed

3903.66 --> 3909.48
like their entire world crumble around

3906.24 --> 3911.52
them because of the ship and their loved

3909.48 --> 3914.16
ones dying because

3911.52 --> 3917.22
they just got caught up in the spell

3914.16 --> 3920.359
yeah not gonna be forgiven

3917.22 --> 3920.359
absolutely not

3923.22 --> 3928.4399999999996
I mean it's gonna amount to something

3925.859 --> 3931.5589999999997
it's gonna amount to jail time for a lot

3928.44 --> 3934.2200000000003
of people and execution for some I

3931.559 --> 3934.2200000000003
guarantee it

3941.35 --> 3950.0
[Music]

3950.299 --> 3953.9
hey psych bear

3959.21 --> 3962.4
[Music]

3977.819 --> 3983.7
right so there is one way that Professor

3981.119 --> 3986.76
feelwell could get back in my chat

3983.7 --> 3987.8999999999996
that is if he addresses me emails me

3986.76 --> 3992.059
something

3987.9 --> 3992.059
admitting that he was wrong

3993.48 --> 3999.599
which I will then publicly show on my

3997.2 --> 4001.9399999999996
show and that's the condition for him to

3999.599 --> 4004.2200000000003
be allowed back on

4001.94 --> 4006.14
because he was wrong and he got is going

4004.22 --> 4009.3799999999997
to have to admit it if he wants to come

4006.14 --> 4012.3799999999997
back if he's too proud to do that we

4009.38 --> 4015.1400000000003
cannot for some reason weird reason

4012.38 --> 4017.48
that's too bad

4015.14 --> 4019.16
because I don't necessarily even want

4017.48 --> 4022.94
him gone I did kind of like having him

4019.16 --> 4026.0589999999997
around but this [ __ ] is just it's a big

4022.94 --> 4028.66
big No-No

4026.059 --> 4031.94
don't start asserting things that are

4028.66 --> 4036.0389999999998
blatantly provably wrong even from

4031.94 --> 4036.039
within the premise that's too far

4039.5 --> 4045.26
right

4041.66 --> 4049.7
I'm just not gonna allow that

4045.26 --> 4053.3590000000004
[Music]

4049.7 --> 4056.72
as YouTube Pro I don't know

4053.359 --> 4061.0989999999997
but he better admit to me he's wrong

4056.72 --> 4063.14
because he is wrong I know he is wrong

4061.099 --> 4064.2200000000003
because radiometric dating does not

4063.14 --> 4066.6189999999997
reach

4064.22 --> 4069.4399999999996
a billion years back is absolutely

4066.619 --> 4072.44
preposterous

4069.44 --> 4074.859
you cannot have any form of accuracy

4072.44 --> 4074.859
with it

4074.9 --> 4079.46
like Beyond a hundred years or so it's

4077.96 --> 4081.98
just not doable

4079.46 --> 4085.7
like that's even admitted like with

4081.98 --> 4087.799
historical research like artifacts and

4085.7 --> 4089.72
things on earth like that they admit

4087.799 --> 4091.339
like yeah we can't actually use

4089.72 --> 4093.9199999999996
radiometric dating because it's just

4091.339 --> 4097.04
going to be wild enough I mean

4093.92 --> 4099.259
and that's like within a thousand years

4097.04 --> 4101.42
or something I mean what the hell man

4099.259 --> 4104.0
who the [ __ ]

4101.42 --> 4106.9400000000005
thinks that you can't be accurate within

4104.0 --> 4111.92
a thousand years but you could

4106.94 --> 4116.48
within billions that's totally insane

4111.92 --> 4119.4800000000005
and wrong by every standard historical

4116.48 --> 4119.48
physics

4119.54 --> 4123.98
all of it

4121.04 --> 4127.54
it's just he's wrong and he has to admit

4123.98 --> 4127.54
it or he's not going to come back ever

4130.94 --> 4135.5
it has to stop the delusional assertions

4134.0 --> 4137.779
have to stop

4135.5 --> 4139.4
can't make up [ __ ] like this and think

4137.779 --> 4142.620000000001
you can just get away with it you can't

4139.4 --> 4143.9
do it you're not allowed to do that here

radiometric dating

4161.179 --> 4165.56
it doesn't matter what type of

4163.1 --> 4167.6
radiometric dating you're going to use

4165.56 --> 4168.799
there's no radiometric dating that can

4167.6 --> 4172.1
help you

4168.799 --> 4173.56
date anything accurate Beyond like a

4172.1 --> 4177.56
hundred years

4173.56 --> 4182.7390000000005
let alone a billion or billions is

4177.56 --> 4182.7390000000005
absolutely ridiculous Beyond ridiculous

4182.839 --> 4189.44
I mean even the most liberal fluid of

4186.319 --> 4191.0

4189.44 --> 4195.699
their chin up

4191.0 --> 4195.699

[Music]

4205.46 --> 4209.38
50 60k years

4209.92 --> 4213.46
nah not really

4214.46 --> 4219.26
that's what they tried

4216.02 --> 4222.56
but then also they confirmed that some

4219.26 --> 4223.76
of their tests were just wildly wildly

4222.56 --> 4226.1
off

4223.76 --> 4229.46
which makes it completely useless

4226.1 --> 4233.120000000001
because when you reach back very far and

4229.46 --> 4236.2390000000005
you can still be wildly off that's a

4233.12 --> 4239.57
problem that's a big problem

4236.239 --> 4242.679999999999
that means it's completely inaccurate

4243.08 --> 4247.64

you can still like oh yeah but we did

4247.64 --> 4253.96
measurements and uh but it's inaccurate
